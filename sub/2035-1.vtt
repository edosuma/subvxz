00:32.875 --> 00:33.999
Go back home.

00:34.083 --> 00:36.499
Go back home, brothers.

00:36.583 --> 00:40.832
Today, we can light lanterns for them.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.165
But who will light them for us tomorrow?

00:44.250 --> 00:48.040
Let their souls protect the border forever!

01:02.375 --> 01:03.665
Fire!

01:35.250 --> 01:36.540
Kill them!

01:37.833 --> 01:39.499
Brothers! Charge!

01:39.583 --> 02:43.165
Charge!

03:03.416 --> 03:04.790
Guiying,

03:04.875 --> 03:08.665
I must break our promise
of living and dying together.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.415
Take care of Wenguang!

03:11.500 --> 03:12.790
Catch it.

03:14.458 --> 03:15.749
Shoot.

03:18.166 --> 03:20.249
Yes! Perfect shots!

03:20.333 --> 03:22.874
Marshal, the pigeon is safe!

03:31.791 --> 03:33.082
Come on.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.624
Don't leave me!

04:07.708 --> 04:09.207
Bodhisattva,

04:09.291 --> 04:12.207
please send Zongbao back safely.

04:13.458 --> 04:15.957
Please bless Zongbao.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.624
Bless Zongbao.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.540
Your lock of hair will be with me
wherever I am.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.415
Zongbao!

04:54.458 --> 04:59.124
Go.

04:59.208 --> 05:00.374
Yang Zongbao!

05:00.458 --> 05:03.332
How can you call yourself a hero
when you bring so many soldiers here?

05:03.416 --> 05:05.874
The Liao intruders have set up
the Tianmen Formation,

05:05.958 --> 05:08.124
resulting in a huge loss of Song soldiers.

05:08.708 --> 05:11.957
Only your "Dragon-Taming Staff"
can break down the formation.

05:12.041 --> 05:15.915
If you want the Dragon-Taming Staff,
you must defeat me first.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.999
Ladies first.

06:16.208 --> 06:16.999
MU

06:35.083 --> 06:38.124
Next time,
it won't be your hair that I chop off.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.332
Where shall I strike you next time?

06:46.791 --> 06:48.540
The outcome is clear.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.957
Miss Mu,
I know you're not willing to rebel,

06:52.041 --> 06:54.332
and I don't want to bring down
the mountain village.

06:54.416 --> 06:57.499
If you surrender
and present the Dragon-Taming Staff,

06:57.583 --> 06:59.540
I promise you that...

07:00.083 --> 07:05.165
the Muke Village will be safe,
and the villagers will enjoy a peaceful life.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.332
Nothing has been settled today.
We'll fight again tomorrow.

07:11.083 --> 07:15.707
Uncle, do you really want to present
the Dragon-Taming Staff and surrender?

07:15.791 --> 07:19.582
Your father proclaimed himself as king
due to compelling factors then.

07:19.666 --> 07:22.374
I wanted to persuade you
to dismiss the brothers earlier

07:22.458 --> 07:24.332
but I did not get the chance.

07:25.083 --> 07:29.874
Since the Yang family troop has a strategy,
why don't we make one, too?

07:30.125 --> 07:32.540
I don't want my brothers
to be robbers for their entire lives.

07:32.625 --> 07:34.749
Can Yang Zongbao be trusted?

07:34.833 --> 07:38.749
Judging from his behaviour today,
I believe he can be trusted.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.249
Once we surrender,
our lives are in their hands.

07:42.333 --> 07:45.540
What will we do if the court breaks its word
and doesn't let our brothers go?

07:45.541 --> 07:49.707
Only when you're safe
will your brothers also be safe.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.999
One night has passed,
what's your decision?

07:57.083 --> 08:00.540
I've spent the entire night in contemplation,
and I have decided...

08:00.666 --> 08:02.040
to capture you!

08:03.250 --> 08:05.582
- General!
- General!

08:08.875 --> 08:10.332
What shall we do?

08:10.416 --> 08:12.790
Mu Guiying! You are incorrigible.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.749
How can you call yourself a hero?

08:15.750 --> 08:17.999
- Release me.
- I'm not a hero at all.

08:23.208 --> 08:26.707
I'm a defeated general.
Do as you please.

08:29.708 --> 08:32.499
Calm down. I won't kill you.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.289
I want you to be my husband.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.664
Be your husband?

08:39.291 --> 08:42.374
Listen carefully. My siblings will be safe
only when I am safe.

08:42.457 --> 08:43.749
Your siblings?

08:44.416 --> 08:45.457
Right!

08:45.541 --> 08:46.582
MU

08:46.666 --> 08:48.665
Zongbao, I've lost you.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.665
I can't lose Wenguang as well.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.290
THE YANG RESIDENCE

08:54.291 --> 08:55.915
BRILLIANT DISCOURSE

09:33.791 --> 09:36.290
Erniang, what are you writing?

09:36.375 --> 09:38.415
I can't make out a single character.

09:38.666 --> 09:42.624
This is called "Sealed Book". Got it?

09:45.708 --> 09:47.165
Look at your face!

09:47.291 --> 09:49.749
Sister, come over, take a look!

09:50.875 --> 09:53.582
"The general's offspring inherits
the loyalty of three generations."

09:53.791 --> 09:55.957
- It's your turn now.
- Sure!

10:30.666 --> 10:31.957
Come on!

11:25.333 --> 11:27.665
Grandmother, can this really fly?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.374
You'll see for yourself soon.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.207
OK, let's release them.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.582
Yes!

11:38.041 --> 11:41.415
Let's make a bigger one next time,
so we can meet the goddess of the moon.

11:41.541 --> 11:42.582
The goddess of the moon.

11:42.666 --> 11:46.207
The big wind will blow you away
to meet Zongbao at the border.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.332
Come on.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.707
Yes.

12:28.583 --> 12:29.874
Sample my magic.

12:33.166 --> 12:35.124
Want to know what I've invented?

12:35.208 --> 12:37.124
Catch me and I will tell you.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.040
Fine.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.124
Tell me.

12:47.208 --> 12:50.499
It will be useful for my father in dealing
with the Western Xia troops.

13:01.583 --> 13:02.624
Liulang.

13:03.750 --> 13:10.540
Our grandson is 18 years old today.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.874
Though I gave him the name Wenguang

13:13.958 --> 13:16.415
in the hope that he
would become an academic,

13:17.416 --> 13:19.832
I have not forgotten your wish.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.874
While teaching him literature,

13:23.583 --> 13:26.624
I have also passed down
your 84 spear forms to him.

13:27.958 --> 13:29.790
This is Mu Guiying.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.290
Dear ancestors,

13:32.583 --> 13:34.790
today is Zongbao's birthday.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.874
It is also Wenguang's
rite of passage ceremony.

13:36.958 --> 13:39.957
I hope that you can bless
and protect Zongbao.

13:40.041 --> 13:41.915
Let him return triumphantly
as soon as possible.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.332
Bless Wenguang with success
in the government examinations.

13:45.416 --> 13:49.957
Let him have a bright future as an official,
while achieving glory for the family.

13:50.041 --> 13:55.832
Yes, the court cares more about politics
than military achievements.

13:55.916 --> 13:59.624
It is suitable for Wenguang
to follow an official's path,

14:00.250 --> 14:05.457
helping the emperor to eradicate evil
and enrich our country.

14:05.541 --> 14:07.249
Liuniang, you are wrong.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.374
- Good morning, Taijun!
- Good morning, Taijun!

14:10.458 --> 14:13.457
It's true that the court prefers
political actions over military merits

14:13.541 --> 14:15.540
but the official circle
is just like the battlefield.

14:15.625 --> 14:19.624
All the parties play tricks on each other.

14:19.708 --> 14:21.874
It is no safer than the battlefield.

14:22.083 --> 14:25.457
As the saying goes, to serve
the emperor is like living with a tiger.

14:25.541 --> 14:30.040
The danger is no less
than that of a battlefield.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.624
Nowadays, the border is in danger.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.082
As citizens of Song,

14:39.083 --> 14:43.165
the Yang family's men
should fight on the battlefield.

14:43.250 --> 14:48.249
If Wenguang simply abandons
a military path and chooses politics,

14:49.041 --> 14:52.374
the Yang ancestors will not be pleased!

14:54.416 --> 14:56.665
Master.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.499
Wow, what a big hole!

14:58.875 --> 15:00.499
What on earth is the matter?

15:00.583 --> 15:02.165
Madam. It's Master Wenguang.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.582
He blew up the wall
and ran out without permission!

15:05.041 --> 15:08.082
Amitabha, please protect Wenguang.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.040
He usually sneaks out to play
by climbing over the wall.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.874
What's the point of blowing it up?

15:12.250 --> 15:15.374
My brother must have stolen
Grandmother's fireworks.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.957
- What kind of fireworks?
- How can they be so powerful?

15:18.041 --> 15:21.707
These fireworks can light up half the sky.

15:21.791 --> 15:23.749
Of course they are very powerful!

15:24.291 --> 15:28.249
Ah, wonderful! Zongbao can use them
to deal with the Western Xia.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.332
These fireworks are not used to kill people,

15:30.416 --> 15:34.082
they'll be activated by my water timer to
signify the start of today's birthday banquet.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.499
Here comes Taijun.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.749
Morning, Taijun.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.540
Taijun, Wenguang ran away
through this hole.

15:40.541 --> 15:41.915
Were people sent to look for him?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.040
I'll go and find him.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.332
No, sister, you always overindulge him.
Let me go instead!

15:45.416 --> 15:46.999
Taijun, don't worry.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.915
Though Wenguang is naughty,
he is reasonable.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.290
He'll come back himself
before tonight's birthday banquet.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.832
How can you be so certain?

15:53.916 --> 15:55.582
Qiniang, go and find him at once.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.332
- Go at once!
- Yes!

16:00.041 --> 16:02.124
HALL OF GRATITUDE

16:18.000 --> 16:20.999
Qiniang is back!

16:24.500 --> 16:27.249
Taijun, we've searched
every corner of the city,

16:27.333 --> 16:28.832
but found no trace of him!

16:28.958 --> 16:31.790
Lord Fan is coming.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.457
Welcome, Lord Fan.

16:37.625 --> 16:40.540
Taijun, Yang ladies,

16:41.166 --> 16:45.207
please don't be so courteous.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.207
I've come due to an urgent matter.
Please pardon me.

16:47.208 --> 16:48.749
Is it related to Zongbao?

16:48.833 --> 16:49.957
Yes.

16:50.041 --> 16:52.415
An urgent report has come
from the border today.

16:52.416 --> 16:55.582
Tianmenguan is lost.
Marshal Yang has...

16:55.666 --> 16:59.207
- Has what?
- He has been killed.

17:06.708 --> 17:10.374
Princess! Are you OK? Princess!

17:10.708 --> 17:12.040
Why?

17:12.290 --> 17:15.332
Mother!
You said Father was a great fighter.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.582
How could he be killed?

17:18.750 --> 17:22.040
Grandmother, you're a vegetarian
and pray to Buddha every day.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.582
Didn't you pray for my father?

17:27.250 --> 17:30.499
Why didn't Buddha protect my father?

17:34.916 --> 17:36.249
Jinhua!

17:36.875 --> 17:39.374
If we were to pray to Buddha...

17:39.458 --> 17:42.749
and he were then
to satisfy all our demands...

17:42.833 --> 17:45.082
that would be preferential treatment.

17:45.666 --> 17:49.540
You chant the sutras day and night.
For what?

17:55.250 --> 17:57.124
He's back!

17:59.791 --> 18:04.082
Young master is back!

18:14.041 --> 18:16.957
Taijun, Grandmother, Mother!
Take a look at my new horse!

18:28.916 --> 18:30.249
What's wrong with you?

18:31.125 --> 18:33.040
Father is dead!

18:34.500 --> 18:35.874
Dead?

18:36.333 --> 18:37.624
Don't joke like that!

18:38.958 --> 18:40.165
Mother!

18:40.250 --> 18:41.749
Is it true?

18:43.833 --> 18:45.207
Mother!

18:45.291 --> 18:48.790
Didn't you say Father
was like the peerless god of war?

18:48.875 --> 18:51.332
How could he be dead?

18:53.041 --> 18:55.915
Taijun!

18:56.583 --> 19:00.790
Didn't you say that Father was
a great fighter, that he would always win?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.290
Taijun!

19:02.708 --> 19:05.832
How could Father be dead? Taijun!

19:08.333 --> 19:13.999
Grandmother!

19:14.916 --> 19:17.165
Wenguang, stop crying!

19:17.416 --> 19:18.874
Stand up!

19:25.541 --> 19:27.207
From now on,

19:28.333 --> 19:30.665
you can only shed blood, not tears!

19:31.583 --> 19:34.665
There are no weak and crying men
in the Yang family.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.290
Wenguang!

19:42.208 --> 19:44.957
Read the couplets
written by your two grandmothers.

19:45.916 --> 19:48.999
"The general's offspring inherits
the loyalty of three generations.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.790
"He carries out the king's missions,
showing four generations of heroism."

20:04.625 --> 20:06.874
ln deep sorrow for
this great man of influence.

20:11.375 --> 20:12.915
In memory of
master yang zongbao

20:14.250 --> 20:18.457
Grand Tutor Pan, Lord Wang,
and Assistant General Liu are coming!

20:23.333 --> 20:24.832
Here is the imperial edict.

20:29.541 --> 20:31.415
Yang Wenguang...

20:31.500 --> 20:34.207
and She Saihua,
prepare to receive the edict!

20:41.666 --> 20:45.874
"I'm surprised to hear of the loss
of the border cities and the troops.

20:46.583 --> 20:50.249
"I hereby appoint Yang Wenguang
as Marshal,

20:50.583 --> 20:53.374
"and She Saihua as Supervisor.

20:53.458 --> 20:55.665
"You shall control 10,000 footmen

20:56.250 --> 20:59.624
"along with 30 war horses
as the vanguard.

20:59.708 --> 21:02.165
"You will use these troops
against the Western Xia."

21:02.250 --> 21:05.040
This edict comes
directly from the emperor!

21:06.250 --> 21:08.707
Only 10,000 troops against
100,000 enemy soldiers.

21:08.791 --> 21:12.207
- This is no imperial edict; this is suicide!
- You want to disobey the edict?

21:12.291 --> 21:13.749
So what if I do?

21:13.958 --> 21:15.249
Princess Chai!

21:16.083 --> 21:20.082
Though you have the imperial decree
of immunity from the law,

21:20.375 --> 21:24.832
that only provides protection
for members of the royal family.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.749
Yang Wenguang
is not entitled to this privilege.

21:29.166 --> 21:30.665
Lord Wang!

21:32.333 --> 21:36.582
This staff was given to me
by the former emperor.

21:36.666 --> 21:40.249
It can strike both fatuous emperors
and treacherous officials!

21:40.333 --> 21:41.707
You...

21:41.833 --> 21:43.582
Please calm down, Taijun!

21:44.666 --> 21:47.832
It takes time to deploy soldiers.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.415
In view of the urgent situation,

21:50.500 --> 21:52.749
the 10,000 soldiers
are only the vanguard.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.957
The main force will follow soon!

21:55.166 --> 21:58.207
The Yang family always
puts national interests first.

21:59.416 --> 22:02.249
Please accept the edict.

22:02.583 --> 22:04.582
Wenguang, accept the edict.

22:04.666 --> 22:06.332
Yes, Taijun!

22:08.041 --> 22:11.040
Thank you for your great kindness,
Your Majesty!

22:11.291 --> 22:16.374
Taijun, Yang ladies, farewell!

22:20.000 --> 22:23.207
They are so malicious,
making Wenguang the marshal!

22:23.500 --> 22:25.374
Don't worry Grandmother,
I will be victorious!

22:25.458 --> 22:27.665
You're not alone.
I will go with you!

22:27.750 --> 22:29.790
But family members are not allowed
to accompany the army!

22:29.875 --> 22:31.999
Accompany?
We are going to join the army!

22:32.000 --> 22:34.832
Yes! We shall join the army!

22:34.916 --> 22:36.165
Fine!

22:37.083 --> 22:40.249
Wenguang,
challenge your grandmothers to a duel!

22:40.333 --> 22:43.457
If you defeat them,
you can go to the battlefield!

22:44.500 --> 22:46.249
Challenge my grandmothers to a duel?

22:46.875 --> 22:48.415
I don't want to hurt them.

22:50.916 --> 22:52.665
- Let me duel with Paifeng instead.
- OK.

22:59.750 --> 23:03.874
Whoever loses their weapon is eliminated!
Start!

23:12.875 --> 23:14.582
I have to go and fight at the border.
Don't stop me!

23:23.041 --> 23:24.790
Princess is watching us.
Let's put on a performance!

23:24.875 --> 23:26.165
Got it!

23:50.750 --> 23:52.040
I win!

23:52.583 --> 23:54.999
Paifeng! How could you
let him beat you deliberately?

23:55.083 --> 23:56.374
I wouldn't dare!

23:56.375 --> 23:58.665
Grandmother,
even though I'm not the best soldier,

23:58.750 --> 24:00.290
I can still lead the troops.

24:00.375 --> 24:04.290
What matters on the battlefield
is intelligence - not kung fu.

24:04.375 --> 24:05.749
Aunt!

24:06.333 --> 24:07.540
Wenguang is right.

24:07.625 --> 24:10.249
With his intelligence,
coupled with our assistance,

24:10.333 --> 24:12.124
we can surely defeat the enemy.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.999
Taijun!

24:17.541 --> 24:21.207
Over these past several decades
of the Song Dynasty

24:21.291 --> 24:23.874
all we have seen are useless regulations
and skulduggery.

24:23.958 --> 24:26.374
Loyal people have no way
to serve the country!

24:26.458 --> 24:31.290
For generations, the Yang clan
have fought bravely on the battlefield,

24:31.375 --> 24:37.207
but the end result is a cold picture
of lonely widows and helpless tears!

24:39.791 --> 24:43.374
Liuniang, as you may already know,

24:44.500 --> 24:48.249
even without an imperial edict,

24:49.250 --> 24:53.582
the Yang family will still go into battle.

24:54.833 --> 24:59.540
It is the duty of a warrior.

24:59.625 --> 25:03.624
What's more, an imperial edict
supersedes everything

25:04.166 --> 25:06.749
and the military has
no room for disobedience.

25:07.291 --> 25:09.915
But, Wenguang is the last male
of the Yang clan!

25:10.291 --> 25:14.957
Since he has no other choice,
please allow me to be his protector.

25:15.041 --> 25:18.582
I'll spare no effort to protect
the last hope of the Yangs!

25:18.666 --> 25:20.040
Please grant my wish!

25:20.125 --> 25:21.957
Taijun! Me too!

25:22.166 --> 25:24.624
Taijun, the same with us!

25:24.708 --> 25:26.040
Fine!

25:29.083 --> 25:33.040
We'll go to battle together!

25:33.125 --> 25:35.249
Thanks, Taijun!

25:36.875 --> 25:38.207
Start cutting!

25:38.291 --> 25:40.624
Miss Paifeng,
do you really want to cut it off?

25:40.708 --> 25:43.415
I won't have time to tie my hair on
the battlefield. A bald head is convenient.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.124
Yes, it's also ugly!

25:45.208 --> 25:46.499
Yeah!

25:46.875 --> 25:49.790
I'm not afraid of losing my head,
let alone shaving it.

25:49.875 --> 25:51.290
Then I'll shave, too.

25:51.375 --> 25:52.582
You?

25:52.666 --> 25:55.915
I'll also go to the battlefield
to kill those Western Xia intruders!

25:56.000 --> 25:57.707
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

25:57.791 --> 26:00.040
- Me, too!
- We'll shave as well!

26:00.125 --> 26:01.832
I'm an honorary daughter of Taijun,

26:01.916 --> 26:04.165
so it's my obligation
to shoulder the risks with the Yangs.

26:04.250 --> 26:06.665
But you need not risk your lives.

26:06.750 --> 26:09.374
Though I'm not a member of the Yang clan,
I'm a citizen of Song!

26:09.458 --> 26:11.290
Right! We should also try
to protect our motherland!

26:11.375 --> 26:13.040
- Right!
- All right!

26:13.125 --> 26:15.374
Sisters, until we defeat the enemy,

26:15.458 --> 26:16.999
we shall never grow long hair again!

26:17.083 --> 26:18.374
Yes!

26:19.458 --> 26:20.749
Miss Paifeng!

26:25.125 --> 26:27.540
- Have you filled the rod with iron sand yet?
- Yes.

26:28.125 --> 26:29.499
Iron sand?

26:29.583 --> 26:31.999
This iron rod is half filled with iron sand.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.665
Though it's heavier than usual,

26:33.666 --> 26:36.499
the weight will be focused at the top.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.624
Therefore the resulting blows will be
much more powerful than before!

26:41.166 --> 26:44.374
Lift your head and raise your eyebrows

26:44.458 --> 26:48.040
Don't be a slave to fate

26:48.125 --> 26:51.582
Who can confront the Yangs?

26:51.666 --> 26:55.082
How powerful!

26:55.166 --> 26:58.749
Cold moon smiling at frost and snow

26:58.833 --> 27:02.374
Encouraging each other till dawn

27:02.458 --> 27:05.874
Phoenix born in the flames

27:05.958 --> 27:09.415
Fly high

27:09.500 --> 27:13.082
Deep pit and high wall

27:13.166 --> 27:16.749
The wind is heartbroken

27:16.833 --> 27:23.999
The aroma of love cannot be retained

27:24.166 --> 27:27.457
Women in armour

27:27.541 --> 27:30.957
Their fragrance shakes the battlefield

27:31.041 --> 27:38.499
Forget mortality

27:38.875 --> 27:45.290
Endless love spurs me on
on the battlefield

27:45.375 --> 27:52.582
A brave heart fears nothing!

27:52.666 --> 27:56.040
Lift your head and raise your eyebrows

27:56.125 --> 27:59.665
Don't be a slave to fate

27:59.750 --> 28:03.249
Who can confront the Yangs?

28:03.333 --> 28:06.124
How powerful!

28:15.708 --> 28:16.999
I see an enemy!

28:22.541 --> 28:25.790
Protect the marshal! Go! Go!

28:30.583 --> 28:33.207
Charge!

28:37.875 --> 28:40.374
Kill!

29:12.708 --> 29:14.749
- Where did they go?
- Quickly!

29:58.833 --> 30:03.874
Hurrah!

30:04.458 --> 30:05.874
Father!

30:06.291 --> 30:10.415
I will kill all our enemies.
Please be at ease in heaven!

30:21.375 --> 30:23.040
Stop!

30:23.333 --> 30:26.082
Report!

30:29.041 --> 30:31.540
Chief Commander!
We've found the camp of the Song troops.

30:31.625 --> 30:34.957
We can get there by midday tomorrow!

30:35.666 --> 30:37.165
Midday?

30:39.875 --> 30:41.207
Here are my orders.

30:41.291 --> 30:44.332
30,000 light cavalry
ride at the front with me.

30:44.416 --> 30:48.790
The rest of the heavy armoured groups
keep going at the current speed.

30:48.875 --> 30:53.749
We'll give the Yang family's troop
a big surprise after sunrise!

30:53.833 --> 30:55.415
Yes Sir!

30:58.000 --> 30:59.874
The enemy has arrived
sooner than we expected.

30:59.958 --> 31:02.207
This not only places
a time restriction on us

31:02.291 --> 31:05.790
but also keeps us far away
from the expected battlefield.

31:05.875 --> 31:11.082
We will not be able to follow
the combat plan made by the emperor.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.665
No problem! Deploy the Routing Enemy
Overlord Formation.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.457
This will allow us to utilise
our infantry's strengths.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.582
No!

31:17.666 --> 31:21.457
This formation is only for battles
on flat ground between equal parties.

31:21.541 --> 31:23.332
I suggest we avoid the enemy's main force.

31:23.416 --> 31:27.249
We should split our army into groups
and engage in guerrilla warfare.

31:27.333 --> 31:28.707
Agreed!

31:29.166 --> 31:31.707
I'll divide the troops into five divisions.

31:32.083 --> 31:36.540
Wuniang, you will lead two divisions.
You are responsible for scouting.

31:37.375 --> 31:41.415
Zou Erniang, lead 1 ,000 soldiers
to distract the enemy's left flank.

31:41.500 --> 31:46.374
Geng Erniang, you will lead 1 ,000 soldiers
to distract the right flank.

31:47.083 --> 31:52.082
Siniang, you lead 1 ,000 soldiers
to secretly attack their provisions in the rear.

31:52.166 --> 31:53.207
Guiying,

31:53.291 --> 31:54.332
Marshal,

31:54.416 --> 31:55.457
Qiniang,

31:55.541 --> 31:56.749
Paifeng,

31:56.833 --> 32:01.999
you will lead 1 ,000 soldiers and launch
an ambush at the proper time.

32:02.666 --> 32:09.082
I shall lead the remaining 6,000 soldiers
to meet the enemy head-on.

32:09.250 --> 32:14.874
Our goal is to kill ten for every one we lose.
We must fight a quick battle!

32:15.125 --> 32:16.374
Yes!

32:16.750 --> 32:22.457
No matter what happens,
we will meet at Huangtu Town!

32:22.541 --> 32:23.832
Yes!

32:24.166 --> 32:26.249
- Here!
- Faster!

32:26.791 --> 32:28.082
Good!

32:30.875 --> 32:33.707
Miss Paifeng,
how many enemies can this bomb kill?

32:33.791 --> 32:35.082
None.

32:35.541 --> 32:38.540
- Then what's it for?
- It can release smoke to cover our retreat.

32:54.541 --> 32:55.832
Brothers!

32:55.916 --> 32:58.707
Today we shall launch a decisive attack
against the Western Xia!

32:59.375 --> 33:01.332
We have no choice but to win!

33:01.416 --> 33:02.707
Yes, sir!

33:08.916 --> 33:12.165
Faster! Faster!
The enemy is coming!

33:43.541 --> 33:44.915
Yin Qi?

33:45.791 --> 33:47.082
Halt!

33:48.000 --> 33:51.707
I heard that the Yang family
is full of widows.

33:53.375 --> 33:55.207
How pitiful!

33:55.833 --> 33:58.540
I'll do you a favour today.

33:58.916 --> 34:03.415
If all the widows become my wives,

34:03.666 --> 34:05.790
I shall spare you from death

34:05.875 --> 34:09.081
and provide a happy life for you instead!

34:09.250 --> 34:10.540
Shoot!

34:15.250 --> 34:18.123
- Protect our marshal!
- Protect our marshal!

34:23.791 --> 34:25.081
Shoot!

34:32.458 --> 34:34.290
Bring out the prisoner!

34:38.125 --> 34:40.248
- My father's helmet?
- Looks like it!

34:43.041 --> 34:44.581
Zongbao?

34:49.458 --> 34:50.540
Stop!

34:50.625 --> 34:53.081
- Father?
- Zongbao's helmet?

34:53.250 --> 34:55.373
- Guiying, what shall we do?
- Calm down!

34:55.458 --> 34:56.748
Don't stop me!

34:57.000 --> 34:58.582
I must rescue my father!

34:59.875 --> 35:03.290
Troops!
Come with me to rescue Commander Yang!

35:03.375 --> 35:05.040
No, we cannot do that!

35:06.125 --> 35:08.040
We cannot act recklessly
before the main force takes action!

35:08.125 --> 35:10.290
How can I just watch
while my father is being killed?

35:10.458 --> 35:12.999
That's not your father.
It's a trap!

35:13.083 --> 35:16.665
- How can you be sure it's not my father?
- I'm sure!

35:16.750 --> 35:18.207
Listen clearly, widows!

35:18.833 --> 35:20.915
Yang Zongbao is in my hands!

35:21.541 --> 35:23.249
I will roast him alive!

35:24.041 --> 35:26.332
A roast lamb of the Song!

35:27.166 --> 35:28.624
Set him alight!

35:31.083 --> 35:32.790
No!

35:32.875 --> 35:35.790
Liuniang! Calm down!

35:35.875 --> 35:37.707
Liuniang, don't mess things up!

35:37.791 --> 35:39.499
Zongbao!

35:39.500 --> 35:40.665
Calm down!

35:40.750 --> 35:43.999
Taijun, don't stop me!
Let me save Zongbao!

35:44.083 --> 35:48.665
Go on! Roast him slowly! Take your time!

35:51.833 --> 35:55.040
It's a trap! Don't fall for their trap!

35:55.916 --> 35:59.707
Taijun, don't stop me!
I have to go and save Zongbao!

35:59.791 --> 36:02.207
Don't be fooled by the enemy!

36:02.375 --> 36:05.290
How can you bear to see Zongbao
burnt to death?

36:05.375 --> 36:06.957
He is not Zongbao!

36:10.750 --> 36:12.707
Do you really want to stop me?

36:13.666 --> 36:15.207
Yes, I do!

36:15.541 --> 36:17.165
I won't let you take this risk

36:17.250 --> 36:19.832
and I won't let you put the entire army
in danger either.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.374
Fine.

36:22.291 --> 36:25.207
Then don't blame me for what
I'm about to do. Assistant General Yang!

36:26.458 --> 36:27.499
Yes!

36:27.583 --> 36:30.249
I order you to take down
Commander Mu at once!

36:32.458 --> 36:34.124
You want to kill me?

36:34.583 --> 36:36.374
Why don't you do it yourself!

36:38.291 --> 36:39.624
Well?

36:40.625 --> 36:42.165
You don't have the guts to do it?

36:43.666 --> 36:45.124
Who said that?

36:47.916 --> 36:49.624
Come on!

37:04.166 --> 37:05.457
Mother?

37:07.791 --> 37:11.374
- Paifeng! Take Wenguang back to Taijun!
- Yes!

37:11.458 --> 37:14.874
The situation is urgent! I'll take charge
of the marshal seal temporarily.

37:14.958 --> 37:17.624
Switch the flag at once
and continue with the rest of the plan.

37:17.708 --> 37:19.374
YANG
Yes!

37:19.458 --> 37:20.457
MU

37:20.541 --> 37:23.082
Marshal Yang is attacking
the enemy himself!

37:23.166 --> 37:24.707
Wenguang, don't go!

37:24.791 --> 37:26.707
Don't stop me! I'll rescue Father!

37:26.791 --> 37:28.165
- Qiniang!
- Yes!

37:28.250 --> 37:30.249
- Report to Taijun immediately!
- OK!

37:31.458 --> 37:33.707
- Bowmen, light the arrows!
- Yes!

37:33.833 --> 37:35.124
Shoot!

37:35.458 --> 37:37.624
- That is not Zongbao!
- Look!

37:52.708 --> 37:54.790
Wenguang is out of control.
Guiying has usurped the marshalship.

37:54.875 --> 37:56.124
Wenguang has gone
to save Zongbao himself!

37:56.208 --> 37:57.374
Taijun! What shall we do?

37:57.458 --> 37:58.749
Wenguang?

37:59.541 --> 38:00.957
- Daniang!
- Yes!

38:01.041 --> 38:04.415
Take half the soldiers to accompany
Qiniang and reinforce them right away!

38:04.500 --> 38:05.790
What?

38:05.875 --> 38:08.457
Taijun! With only half our force left,

38:08.541 --> 38:11.290
how can we defend against
Western Xia's cavalry?

38:11.416 --> 38:13.374
Taijun, use the Empty City Trick!

38:22.833 --> 38:24.082
Charge!

39:05.333 --> 39:06.707
- Father!
- I'm not your father!

39:07.458 --> 39:09.415
Who are you?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.332
This bitch has also come to die!

39:13.416 --> 39:15.957
- Who are you?
- Wenguang!

39:16.041 --> 39:17.499
Get on the horse!

39:17.750 --> 39:19.832
Master, get on the horse!

39:21.291 --> 39:22.582
Let's go!

39:25.125 --> 39:26.415
Shoot!

39:28.958 --> 39:30.624
Arrows are coming!

39:40.458 --> 39:43.249
- Baixue!
- Wenguang, quickly! Move!

39:43.250 --> 39:44.582
Quickly!

39:50.416 --> 39:51.707
- Let's go!
- Yes!

39:54.958 --> 39:56.249
Look out!

40:04.166 --> 40:06.082
Protect the mistress!

40:06.166 --> 40:07.582
Master, be careful!

40:10.541 --> 40:12.540
Yangchun!

40:13.458 --> 40:14.915
Bastard!

40:17.625 --> 40:19.707
Sorry, Mistress. We're late!

40:19.708 --> 40:21.999
No! You're right on time!
Come, let's fight together!

40:22.416 --> 40:23.999
- Another barrage is coming!
- Golden Roof Defence!

40:24.083 --> 40:25.374
Yes!

40:27.666 --> 40:29.290
The Wolf-Fang Cavalry are coming again!

40:30.083 --> 40:32.540
- Arhat Turns Over!
- Yes!

40:33.583 --> 40:35.582
- Crescent Moon Formation!
- Yes!

40:44.541 --> 40:47.165
- Attack!
- Attack!

40:50.125 --> 40:51.415
Guiying,

40:51.625 --> 40:52.707
Taijun has retreated!

40:52.791 --> 40:54.999
She sent us to help you retreat!

40:55.666 --> 40:58.624
- We're not fighting any more?
- More fighting? Get on your horse!

41:04.916 --> 41:07.040
Attack!

41:17.458 --> 41:18.624
Retreat!

41:18.708 --> 41:21.499
Attack!

41:23.541 --> 41:25.207
- Search!
- No one here!

41:25.291 --> 41:26.749
- Burn it!
- Yes, sir!

41:35.583 --> 41:36.874
Shoot!

41:42.250 --> 41:43.582
Grandmother.

41:44.375 --> 41:46.415
Attack!

41:52.000 --> 41:54.082
Come on. Charge.

42:14.375 --> 42:17.332
Zongbao,
I knew you would protect Wenguang.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.874
Miss Paifeng.

43:52.875 --> 43:54.207
Daniang!

43:56.958 --> 43:58.249
Shoot!

44:00.958 --> 44:02.249
Grandmother!

44:03.500 --> 44:05.207
Daniang!

44:08.541 --> 44:09.915
You demon!

44:11.583 --> 44:13.040
Wenguang.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.499
Attack!

44:19.625 --> 44:20.915
Shoot.

44:40.250 --> 44:42.124
Guiying, come with me right now.

44:42.208 --> 44:43.290
No!

44:43.375 --> 44:45.207
I must take Wenguang with me.

44:49.666 --> 44:51.499
Mistress, please get out of here!
More enemies are coming.

44:51.583 --> 44:52.874
But Wenguang...

44:53.000 --> 44:54.415
Entrust Wenguang to me. Please go.

44:54.500 --> 44:57.374
Guiying! We can't do without a marshal.
Get on your horse!

45:01.041 --> 45:02.915
Go!

45:04.500 --> 45:05.790
Shoot!

45:38.125 --> 45:39.790
- Wenguang!
- Master!

45:39.875 --> 45:43.207
- Master.
- Master.

45:45.458 --> 45:48.207
- Attack!
- Damn it! The enemy is coming! Go!

45:48.291 --> 45:50.082
No, I must rescue Wenguang.

45:50.166 --> 45:51.374
- We can't get down.
- How do we get down there?

45:51.458 --> 45:53.707
- I must rescue Wenguang!
- I want to rescue Wenguang!

45:53.791 --> 45:55.082
Please go!

45:55.541 --> 45:58.582
- Wenguang!
- Attack!

45:59.916 --> 46:03.540
Commander, the main Song force
played the Empty City Trick.

46:03.625 --> 46:04.790
They've already disappeared
without a trace.

46:04.875 --> 46:06.832
Song's marshal, Yang Wenguang,
has been killed.

46:06.916 --> 46:09.957
Mu Guiying has escaped
with less than 3,000 soldiers.

46:10.041 --> 46:11.165
We will surely win.

46:11.250 --> 46:13.790
The main force played
the Empty City Trick and escaped.

46:15.458 --> 46:18.374
Search for the ballistae
in the Song camp right now.

46:18.458 --> 46:19.749
Yes Sir!

46:21.541 --> 46:24.874
Why are there wars?

46:25.125 --> 46:27.332
So many people died on both sides.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.499
Why are there some female soldiers?

46:29.500 --> 46:32.207
Brothers! Rest in peace!

46:32.833 --> 46:37.165
Brothers! Rest in peace! Go home!

46:37.250 --> 46:41.874
Sisters! Rest in peace! Go home!

46:42.208 --> 46:44.332
Oh! A golden spear!

46:45.000 --> 46:46.207
The armour looks very valuable.

46:46.291 --> 46:48.540
- I want the helmet.
- Quick! Climb up and get him down!

46:48.625 --> 46:51.165
Get up! Get up!

46:51.541 --> 46:52.832
I'm too heavy!

46:53.916 --> 46:55.207
Don't move!

46:57.416 --> 46:58.790
Little Douzi, climb up!

46:58.875 --> 47:00.165
OK!

47:04.875 --> 47:06.165
What do you want?

47:06.250 --> 47:07.540
I was trying to save you.

47:13.666 --> 47:15.499
Little Douzi! Are you OK?

47:16.166 --> 47:17.415
No problem.

47:47.958 --> 47:50.957
Qiniang's death today was so terrible.

47:51.041 --> 47:52.457
Daniang's death was such a great loss.

47:52.541 --> 47:54.332
She killed so many enemies.

47:55.625 --> 47:58.457
Do you think we failed this time?

47:59.708 --> 48:03.249
We're the Yang clan's female soldiers!

48:03.833 --> 48:06.249
Never say die until the last moment.

48:06.333 --> 48:08.624
Right! Never say die.

48:08.708 --> 48:11.249
Sister. Are you crying?

48:12.375 --> 48:14.707
I failed to protect Master Wenguang.

48:17.375 --> 48:19.207
How can I face Taijun,

48:19.916 --> 48:25.082
Princess and Madam Guiying?

48:34.416 --> 48:35.874
Are you thinking about Wenguang?

48:37.458 --> 48:40.040
I think his character is like yours somehow.

48:41.416 --> 48:44.374
When Yang Yanzhao couldn't beat
the Liao Kingdom's Tianmen Formation,

48:44.708 --> 48:47.249
he sent Zongbao to borrow
the Dragon-Taming Staff from you.

48:48.375 --> 48:50.124
However, you two got married
on the battlefield.

48:54.083 --> 48:56.499
Spare him!

49:04.250 --> 49:05.540
How come you're here?

49:05.625 --> 49:06.874
For you, of course!

49:06.958 --> 49:08.957
- I'll go and reason with your father.
- No.

49:09.041 --> 49:10.874
It's my problem,
I can't bother you with it.

49:10.958 --> 49:14.457
I have informed the marshal that, provided
you present the Dragon-Taming Staff,

49:14.541 --> 49:16.790
your siblings will be safe.

49:16.875 --> 49:18.332
What's wrong with you?

49:18.416 --> 49:20.957
How can you protect my siblings
when you can't even protect yourself?

49:21.041 --> 49:23.082
My word is my bond.

49:23.416 --> 49:27.415
Fine! Since you kept your promise
and we're married,

49:27.541 --> 49:29.332
I'll protect you
even if I have to lose my own life.

49:29.416 --> 49:31.124
- Wait for me!
- But...

49:32.041 --> 49:33.332
You said this marriage...

49:34.083 --> 49:35.707
was just to protect your siblings.

49:37.500 --> 49:41.332
Then, in exchange, I offer my life!

49:43.958 --> 49:46.374
This is our treasure:
Dragon-Taming Staff.

49:46.458 --> 49:49.207
Marshal Yang, I'm here to exchange
the Dragon-Taming Staff

49:49.291 --> 49:50.957
for Yang Zongbao's head!

49:51.833 --> 49:53.124
Miss Mu,

49:53.583 --> 49:56.624
Yang Zongbao committed
three capital crimes.

49:56.708 --> 49:57.999
I don't care!

49:58.583 --> 50:01.415
The Dragon-Taming Staff more than
makes up for his crimes.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.790
Release him at once!

50:04.500 --> 50:06.374
Miss Mu's contribution

50:06.500 --> 50:08.957
can only exempt him from
staying out all night.

50:09.791 --> 50:11.874
He still missed two days' roll call.

50:11.958 --> 50:13.290
What will you do?

50:13.666 --> 50:15.832
I'll fight in his place to offset his crimes!

50:15.916 --> 50:17.457
If you win, I'll exempt another punishment!

50:17.541 --> 50:20.832
Now, what about the marriage
on the battlefield?

50:22.208 --> 50:25.290
I promise you that I will break through
the Tianmen Formation. Will that do?

50:26.250 --> 50:28.457
Miss Mu, since you are fighting
instead of Zongbao,

50:28.541 --> 50:31.165
then your mission is to exchange his head
with the enemy general's head!

50:31.166 --> 50:32.707
Consider it done!

50:37.500 --> 50:38.624
General...

50:38.708 --> 50:42.415
this strand of hair,
shall I help you return it to Miss Mu?

50:46.416 --> 50:48.790
When we fought last time, I cut it off.

50:48.875 --> 50:50.249
I did not want to throw it away.

50:55.500 --> 50:58.499
Since you like it that much,
protect it with your life.

50:59.041 --> 51:01.582
I'll keep it safe for as long as I live.

51:01.916 --> 51:03.707
This lock of hair will be with me
wherever I go.

51:06.083 --> 51:07.124
OK, no more reminiscing.

51:07.208 --> 51:09.165
You should treat your arrow wound
as soon as possible.

51:09.250 --> 51:10.832
We can't do without a leader.

51:19.083 --> 51:23.249
I've fed you for so many days,
but you're still so thin.

51:23.333 --> 51:24.874
Attack! Attack.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.332
Enemy soldiers.

52:22.041 --> 52:25.665
Attack!

52:25.750 --> 52:27.082
Why don't they kill them?

52:27.166 --> 52:28.499
Of course they don't.

52:30.208 --> 52:32.957
They are not real Song
and Western Xia troops at all.

52:33.375 --> 52:34.415
Who are you?

52:34.500 --> 52:36.540
We saved you!

52:36.625 --> 52:38.332
Oh! Why are you still standing here?

52:38.416 --> 52:39.790
Go and meet your father!

52:39.875 --> 52:41.165
My father?

52:48.750 --> 52:50.749
He's Chief Commander
of the Westward Expedition, Yang Zongbao!

52:50.750 --> 52:52.665
- Right.
- Wenguang.

52:52.833 --> 52:56.040
Ever since Little Douzi
brought you back with the golden spear,

52:56.125 --> 52:57.540
I guessed that it was you.

53:03.125 --> 53:05.415
Father, I've met you at last!

53:05.500 --> 53:08.665
How are your mother,
grandmother and Taijun doing?

53:09.708 --> 53:11.374
I got separated from Mother!

53:11.458 --> 53:12.749
Father...

53:13.041 --> 53:14.332
I lost the battle.

53:14.708 --> 53:16.415
Why are you here?

53:16.916 --> 53:18.415
It's a long story.

53:19.041 --> 53:22.582
I'm here thanks to Little Douzi's grandfather,
and her clansmen.

53:30.125 --> 53:31.915
Marshal Yang! Get in!

53:34.333 --> 53:35.707
So you want to run away?

53:42.416 --> 53:43.457
Are you all right?

53:43.541 --> 53:45.749
General Yang, here's the whip!

53:46.166 --> 54:09.832
Catch them!

54:28.208 --> 54:29.499
Hold on!

54:35.958 --> 54:37.082
Master! Master!

54:37.166 --> 54:38.874
Are you OK? Master! Are you OK?

54:38.958 --> 54:41.165
Are you OK? Grandfather!

54:42.208 --> 54:44.374
- Grandfather!
- Why did you risk your life to save me?

54:45.708 --> 54:47.165
General.

54:47.416 --> 54:49.415
I entrust my granddaughter

54:50.125 --> 54:54.040
and clansmen to you.

54:54.125 --> 54:56.582
You must lead them
in serving the country

54:57.041 --> 55:00.790
and kill the invaders once and for all!

55:02.250 --> 55:03.707
Grandfather!

55:04.333 --> 55:05.874
So you decided to stay here.

55:05.958 --> 55:08.374
But why didn't you
send a message to your family?

55:10.208 --> 55:12.499
I was going to send a message
after winning the battle.

55:12.583 --> 55:14.499
Failures are common in wars.

55:14.500 --> 55:17.582
A failure is no excuse
for not contacting your family!

55:19.125 --> 55:20.749
Tianmenguan was lost.

55:20.833 --> 55:22.915
All were dead except me.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.290
I sullied the Yang clan's reputation.

55:25.375 --> 55:27.374
I'd rather that everybody
thought I was dead.

55:27.458 --> 55:29.624
Is reputation so important?

55:29.708 --> 55:32.457
Reputation, for a soldier,
is more important than life itself!

55:32.541 --> 55:34.290
Father! You're wrong.

55:34.291 --> 55:38.332
Your safety is more important to Mother
and all the grandmothers!

55:38.708 --> 55:40.624
They have suffered as the Yang men
died one after another.

55:40.708 --> 55:41.915
They've been hurt badly.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.999
- They must not be hurt any more!
- Wenguang!

55:44.083 --> 55:47.374
My grandfather said not everyone can
abandon their family to save the nation!

55:47.458 --> 55:49.957
Who doesn't want to live happily
with their family?

55:50.041 --> 55:52.249
You shouldn't blame
General Yang any more.

55:53.666 --> 55:54.957
Wenguang.

55:56.250 --> 55:57.957
Thank goodness you escaped.

55:58.958 --> 56:00.457
I hope your mother

56:00.541 --> 56:04.124
can protect your grandmother
and Taijun and get out of harm's way.

56:05.208 --> 56:06.499
My mother, she...

56:07.125 --> 56:09.499
- I'm sorry about Mother!
- What's the matter?

56:09.583 --> 56:11.874
I recklessly broke into the enemy's camp.

56:11.958 --> 56:13.999
Mother was then forced to usurp
the marshalship and change the banner.

56:14.083 --> 56:15.665
What? You...

56:16.333 --> 56:18.999
Usurping the marshalship
on the battlefield is a capital crime!

56:19.083 --> 56:21.124
Is there any way to save her?

56:21.958 --> 56:23.290
Yes!

56:23.375 --> 56:25.832
Defeat the enemy.
Redeem the crime with merit!

56:42.541 --> 56:44.665
- Stop!
- Stop!

56:49.541 --> 56:50.624
It's an ambush.

56:50.708 --> 56:52.415
Follow me! Go!

57:06.208 --> 57:07.249
Go!

57:07.333 --> 57:08.915
Damn it!

57:14.291 --> 57:16.749
- Get into formation!
- Get into formation!

57:49.500 --> 57:52.832
Sikong!

57:53.625 --> 57:54.915
Wuniang.

57:57.583 --> 57:58.874
Sijing!

58:36.708 --> 58:39.624
Taijun! Many Western Xia soldiers
are lurking ahead.

58:39.708 --> 58:40.999
Please retreat first.
Let me reinforce the rear!

58:41.083 --> 58:43.624
Fine! Finish the battle! Do not linger!

58:43.708 --> 58:44.999
See you in Huangtu Town!

58:47.500 --> 58:51.165
Don't let them escape! Kill them!

58:58.208 --> 59:00.290
Wuniang! I'll go and protect Taijun!

59:00.375 --> 59:01.665
OK!

59:06.541 --> 59:07.915
Taijun, follow me!

59:08.000 --> 59:09.665
OK! This way!

59:13.250 --> 59:15.290
Liuniang, it's up to you!

59:15.500 --> 59:16.790
Of course!

59:37.750 --> 59:40.749
Taijun!
Ahead is the entrance into Wolf Cliff.

59:40.833 --> 59:41.874
There is no way out!

59:41.958 --> 59:43.249
Wolf Cliff?

59:47.916 --> 59:50.415
Taijun! Liuniang sent us to report to you.

59:50.500 --> 59:52.624
Liuniang has gone
to do field reconnaissance.

59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.374
Taijun! There are many enemy soldiers.
We must retreat!

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:04.082
Taijun! Please retreat quickly!

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:06.790
The Western Xia soldiers
are setting up fireballs on the hill.

01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:09.540
OK! Let's break through Wolf Cliff.

01:00:14.666 --> 01:00:16.915
Oh, no! Taijun is in danger!

01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:25.415
WOLF CLIFF

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.290
Everyone, listen!

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:32.749
Calm down! Follow me into the cave!

01:00:32.833 --> 01:00:34.124
Yes!

01:00:37.541 --> 01:00:39.624
Report!
The enemy has retreated into the cave!

01:00:39.708 --> 01:00:41.957
Good. Launch the fireballs!

01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:47.165
Take care! Be careful of the fireballs!

01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:53.165
- Calm down!
- Yes!

01:00:53.666 --> 01:00:55.582
Be careful of the fireballs!

01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:07.540
- This way!
- This way!

01:01:07.625 --> 01:01:09.915
Protect Taijun! You, follow me!

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.290
Hold on!

01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:14.290
Taijun, be careful!

01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:15.665
Quick! Follow me!

01:01:15.958 --> 01:01:18.790
If this situation keeps up,

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.082
Taijun will either be burnt
or choke to death!

01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:22.540
What shall we do?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.332
Fight fire with fire.

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:22.790
Wolf Valley is indeed a death trap.

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:25.374
Guiying! Do you have an escape plan?

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.957
- Build a bridge.
- Build a bridge?

01:02:38.375 --> 01:02:40.624
You two, take off your chain mail.

01:02:40.708 --> 01:02:41.915
Yes!

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.499
Aunt! I'll weave a chain together
and then you shoot it over, OK?

01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:45.624
OK!

01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:46.999
Good idea!

01:03:04.208 --> 01:03:05.499
Go.

01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:16.915
Calm down! It must be Bajie
putting out the fireballs with fire!

01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:19.415
- It's done!
- Come!

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.540
Taijun!

01:03:21.875 --> 01:03:23.082
Taijun! There's not much time left!

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.415
- Now what?
- Don't worry, we've got it in hand

01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:42.249
Done. Taijun, we've secured it.

01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:43.749
Zhuifeng, Zhuiying! Cross the bridge!

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:45.124
Yes!

01:03:57.708 --> 01:03:58.999
OK!

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.165
Taijun! The iron chain is securely fixed!

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:03.332
You can come over!

01:04:03.416 --> 01:04:04.457
OK!

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:06.915
Soldiers, forward! Climb onto
the iron chains! Make a bridge!

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.290
Yes!

01:04:18.666 --> 01:04:20.082
Miss Paifeng!

01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:24.499
Liuniang! Are we late?

01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:26.332
Paifeng! You're just in time!

01:04:27.625 --> 01:04:29.707
- Ready!
- Good!

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:31.790
Let me be the first to cross!

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:33.374
Taijun! No!

01:04:33.583 --> 01:04:35.874
Don't worry, it won't be a problem.

01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:38.290
Taijun, be careful!

01:05:10.625 --> 01:05:12.374
Taijun! Be careful!

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:20.290
- Good!
- Good!

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:23.332
- Guiying! Lead them across the bridge!
- Yes!

01:05:29.083 --> 01:05:30.374
Let's go!

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:36.957
Damn it!
It was you making all that trouble!

01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:38.874
- Come on!
- Kill her!

01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:46.082
Here, come up!

01:05:50.625 --> 01:05:52.290
Oh, no! You must cross quickly!

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:53.415
Bajie! Go across now!

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.999
If anything happens here,
I'll shoot another arrow!

01:05:56.166 --> 01:05:57.915
Don't hesitate! Go quickly!

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.957
Be careful!
Come over at once, Sanniang!

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.332
Go quickly!

01:06:07.916 --> 01:06:09.207
Follow me closely!

01:06:09.291 --> 01:06:11.249
Wuniang! Go faster!

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.290
Faster!

01:06:18.625 --> 01:06:23.832
Protect Taijun!

01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:30.332
Be careful!

01:06:30.416 --> 01:06:31.499
Hold on!

01:06:31.583 --> 01:06:32.874
Hold on tightly!

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.832
I'm OK.

01:06:35.041 --> 01:06:37.749
Please find a way to rescue Wuniang.

01:06:40.916 --> 01:06:42.915
I have a solution! Use my chain armour!

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.165
Use my arrow to save her!

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:47.499
Wuniang! Hold on!

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.707
Faster!

01:06:51.791 --> 01:06:53.332
Wuniang, here comes the arrow!

01:06:55.625 --> 01:06:56.915
Wuniang!

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.040
Hold on!

01:07:04.625 --> 01:07:07.374
Hold on tight! We'll pull you up!

01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:08.665
- OK!
- Pull!

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:09.915
Pull harder!

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.832
- Pull!
- Pull hard! Come on!

01:07:11.916 --> 01:07:13.790
- Pull!
- Hold on!

01:07:13.875 --> 01:07:15.499
- Pull!
- Go on!

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.415
- Pull!
- Pull hard!

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.082
Pull!

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:22.915
Taijun!

01:07:37.875 --> 01:07:38.915
Siniang is coming!

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.290
Siniang!

01:08:11.375 --> 01:08:12.624
Good!

01:08:34.625 --> 01:08:36.915
- Siniang!
- Princess! Where's Taijun?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.665
Taijun and the others are trapped
in Hungry-Wolf Valley.

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:40.249
The odds are against them!

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:49.624
Liuniang! Taijun is all right!

01:08:52.332 --> 01:09:03.665
Taijun!

01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:06.624
Taijun! Please forgive us
for not protecting you.

01:09:07.125 --> 01:09:09.290
It's OK so long as you're fine.
Get up, please!

01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:11.207
- Get up!
- Thanks! Taijun!

01:09:12.332 --> 01:09:15.124
Taijun! Please punish me.

01:09:15.207 --> 01:09:17.249
Daniang and Qiniang died.

01:09:17.332 --> 01:09:20.499
Wenguang is missing.
I deserve to be punished.

01:09:20.582 --> 01:09:21.624
Punish you?

01:09:21.707 --> 01:09:24.332
OK! I have one question for you.

01:09:24.416 --> 01:09:28.540
If you had the chance to do it over again,
would you still usurp the marshalship?

01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:29.915
I would!

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:35.165
Trifles are worked out by public discussion,
while big events are dealt with alone.

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:37.124
Since you're so resolute,

01:09:37.207 --> 01:09:39.165
I trust your choice!

01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:41.165
You do not need to blame yourself.

01:09:41.625 --> 01:09:43.749
The Yangs are all loyal warriors.

01:09:43.832 --> 01:09:46.165
How can the Yang clan not last forever?

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:51.082
Taijun! You also believe
Wenguang is still alive?

01:09:51.207 --> 01:09:52.457
Of course!

01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:53.874
- We all believe that!
- We all believe that!

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:55.457
Yes! We all believe!

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.499
Guiying, are you OK?

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.499
Taijun, Guiying received an arrow wound.

01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:06.165
Taijun, we cannot stay here long!
We must move at once!

01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:10.540
Treat it right away.
We cannot do without a leader like you!

01:10:10.625 --> 01:10:11.915
Yes!

01:10:16.666 --> 01:10:18.374
- Stop.
- Stop.

01:10:18.625 --> 01:10:20.165
Report!

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.707
Yang Wenguang tried to launch
a rushed attack

01:10:26.791 --> 01:10:29.874
and Mu Guiying usurped the marshalship!
The whole battalion has collapsed!

01:10:29.958 --> 01:10:32.082
Mu Guiying usurped the marshalship?

01:10:32.166 --> 01:10:36.290
What sheer disregard for military discipline!
She must be punished!

01:10:36.958 --> 01:10:40.207
Pass along this message:
Stay in place and await my orders!

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.790
Yes!

01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:44.582
Taijun is coming!

01:10:44.875 --> 01:10:46.165
Open the gate quickly!

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:58.540
Taijun. When we arrived here yesterday,

01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:00.540
we found Song troops
to the southeast of Huangtu Town.

01:11:00.625 --> 01:11:01.915
Song troops?

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.457
Is Wang Qiang coming?

01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:05.749
I think so.
They are holding the flag of Wang.

01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:07.207
How many soldiers did you see?

01:11:07.291 --> 01:11:08.999
Around 100,000 or so.

01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:10.374
Report!

01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:11.915
Taijun! Zou Erniang...

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.165
Let me speak for myself! Taijun, we
disrupted the enemy's left flank successfully

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:18.249
and fulfilled the task of killing ten
for every one of our troops lost!

01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:19.624
It's a pity that...

01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:23.790
Geng Erniang died in battle.

01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:25.290
Died?

01:11:28.166 --> 01:11:29.832
Taijun! The situation is dire!

01:11:29.916 --> 01:11:32.499
Western Xia troops are marching
towards Huangtu Town.

01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:33.874
What shall we do?

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:37.665
Report! Assistant General Liu
asks to speak with you!

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:39.540
- Assistant General Liu?
- Enter!

01:11:47.166 --> 01:11:48.624
Taijun!

01:11:51.833 --> 01:11:53.415
Marshal Mu...

01:11:56.875 --> 01:12:01.332
Marshal Wang has led 100,000 soldiers
to converge with Marshal Yang Wenguang.

01:12:01.791 --> 01:12:03.207
He has sent me...

01:12:03.291 --> 01:12:04.374
Wenguang is still alive?

01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:07.165
..to invite you two to discuss strategies
for attacking the enemy!

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.249
Please go back first.

01:12:09.583 --> 01:12:11.499
We'll follow soon!

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:14.249
Yes! See you there!

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.082
Taijun!

01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:20.332
Guiying must not go!

01:12:20.958 --> 01:12:23.540
She'd be sentenced to death
for usurping the marshalship!

01:12:23.625 --> 01:12:25.624
Wang Qiang knows
we will not be trapped so easily,

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:26.957
so he's using Wenguang as bait!

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:32.249
My opinion is that we claim Guiying
is severely wounded.

01:12:33.166 --> 01:12:35.707
Liuniang and I will find out
what is really happening.

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:39.999
- Agreed!
- Taijun, since losing Wenguang,

01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:41.415
I cannot sleep or eat.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.374
Now that we have this information,

01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:47.499
and the enemy is approaching,
time is of the utmost importance.

01:12:47.583 --> 01:12:50.124
True or false, so long as we can
get Wang Qiang to send troops in time,

01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:52.415
l would not regret it,
even if it means my death.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.207
Marshal Yang!
There are many Song soldiers up ahead!

01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:04.290
- They're flying the flag of Wang!
- Wang Qiang!

01:13:04.291 --> 01:13:05.582
Wang Qiang is coming?

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:10.374
Lord Wang, where is Wenguang?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.499
Wenguang?

01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:19.124
You can meet him in hell
after enjoying your punishment!

01:13:19.208 --> 01:13:20.499
Report!

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:22.749
Lord! Yang Wenguang is coming!

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:25.415
He is still alive?

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.957
Well then, let him enter!

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.290
Grandson!

01:13:35.916 --> 01:13:38.207
- Grandmother!
- How are you, Wenguang?

01:13:38.333 --> 01:13:40.290
Are you OK? Are you wounded?

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:41.915
I'm fine!

01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:43.874
Taijun!

01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:47.999
Our Yang ancestors have blessed you!

01:13:54.375 --> 01:13:57.290
Mother, I was wrong.

01:13:58.041 --> 01:13:59.499
This is ridiculous!

01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:02.249
This is my military tent,

01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:04.290
not the Yang family household!

01:14:04.375 --> 01:14:06.540
We should limit our speech
to official matters!

01:14:06.625 --> 01:14:08.207
Official matters?

01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:13.040
Lord Wang, please send troops
against the enemy right away!

01:14:13.375 --> 01:14:14.874
I agree with sending troops.

01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:17.540
However, there's a precondition.

01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:18.832
What precondition?

01:14:18.916 --> 01:14:23.499
Execute your mother yourself.

01:14:23.583 --> 01:14:24.999
Wang Qiang!

01:14:27.291 --> 01:14:29.624
You must not execute Mu Guiying today!

01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:33.249
Now the situation is urgent.

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:35.999
You didn't send reinforcements
because of an ulterior motive.

01:14:36.083 --> 01:14:39.332
Instead of discussing how to cope
with the enemy on the front line,

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:41.790
you try to kill loyal generals!

01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:44.874
You are weakening your own defence
and supporting the enemy!

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:46.540
- How dare you!
- Wang Qiang!

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:50.165
Yang Wenguang! If you ignore the law
and refuse to execute Mu Guiying,

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:51.957
I will have you convicted as well!

01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:53.332
Convict me?

01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:55.832
- I will execute you first!
- Wenguang!

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.749
- The military law cannot be disobeyed!
- Liu Fu!

01:14:57.833 --> 01:14:59.749
- Yes!
- Seize this assassin!

01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:01.999
- Attendants!
- Yes!

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:06.915
Whoever dares hurt Yang Wenguang
will answer to my dragon-headed staff!

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.165
- You!
- Report!

01:15:09.875 --> 01:15:12.415
Marshal,
Yang Zongbao requests to see you.

01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:16.040
Weren't his troops utterly annihilated?

01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:18.124
Mother, please don't worry any more.
Father is not dead!

01:15:18.208 --> 01:15:19.499
Let him in.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.374
Zongbao...

01:15:37.625 --> 01:15:39.999
Mother! I'm sorry.

01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:41.374
Zongbao!

01:15:42.375 --> 01:15:45.415
Is it a dream? Are you still alive?

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:49.124
Taijun.

01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:51.749
- Zongbao is not dead
- Grandmother!

01:15:51.833 --> 01:15:53.290
- Look!
- Zongbao!

01:15:53.375 --> 01:15:54.665
I'm sorry!

01:15:55.125 --> 01:15:57.249
- Zongbao!
- Please forgive my disobedience!

01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:59.207
I've disgraced the family's reputation!

01:16:00.083 --> 01:16:01.499
Zongbao!

01:16:01.666 --> 01:16:03.624
It's OK, so long as you're alive!

01:16:10.958 --> 01:16:12.332
Yang Zongbao!

01:16:13.666 --> 01:16:18.374
Since you were alive,
why did you not report to the court?

01:16:21.458 --> 01:16:25.082
Lord Wang, you have 100,000 soldiers.

01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:28.165
Why did you not
send reinforcements to me?

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.207
You wasted an entire battalion!

01:16:31.333 --> 01:16:32.707
Good!

01:16:32.791 --> 01:16:34.415
Well said!

01:16:34.916 --> 01:16:38.624
I will not compel you!

01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:41.999
If you want me to send troops,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.874
you will either execute Mu Guiying,
who usurped the marshalship,

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.207
or execute this assassin Yang Wenguang!

01:16:50.291 --> 01:16:54.624
Whether you want to obey the law or not,
the choice is in your hand!

01:16:56.333 --> 01:16:57.749
Zongbao!

01:16:58.083 --> 01:17:01.124
After seeing you again,
I do not have any regrets.

01:17:01.875 --> 01:17:03.624
Give the verdict!

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:14.915
Execute!

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.415
No!

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.832
Fine!

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:20.082
Why do you say "fine"?

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.249
What else would I say?

01:17:23.166 --> 01:17:26.457
Yang Zongbao is following military law,
putting justice before personal feelings.

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:27.957
Once it becomes known,

01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:31.124
it will become a much-told story,
like Marshal Yang Yanzhao!

01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:32.499
You...

01:17:35.375 --> 01:17:39.415
How will I die? At the hands
of an executioner or on the battlefield?

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.999
It is my own choice!

01:17:41.083 --> 01:17:42.749
You dare rebel against the court?

01:17:42.833 --> 01:17:46.582
I was once a bandit, remember?

01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:48.665
Zongbao, let's go!

01:17:48.666 --> 01:17:50.165
Seize Mu Guiying!

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.499
- Execute her at once!
- Yes!

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:56.499
- Guiying!
- Who dares touch her?

01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:57.790
Grandmother! They're our own people!

01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.999
- Our own people!
- Mistress, go quickly!

01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:02.540
Madam Yang, please go with us!

01:18:02.875 --> 01:18:04.165
Spies!

01:18:04.666 --> 01:18:07.290
- Liu Fu, after them!
- Yes!

01:18:09.666 --> 01:18:10.957
Liu Fu!

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.540
- Do you dare disobey me?
- I dare not!

01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:17.207
I just want to stay here to protect you.

01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:19.790
Just in case of an accident.

01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:26.540
Well, Yang Zongbao,

01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:30.707
you dare collaborate with spies
and release these criminals?

01:18:30.791 --> 01:18:32.207
Even if I don't execute you,

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:37.999
the emperor will have you executed
when I report this to his highness.

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:40.040
I deserve capital punishment.

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:43.665
Please keep your word and send troops
immediately to combat the enemy!

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:46.040
Sending troops is not
something I'm concerned about.

01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:49.915
However, you must catch
the criminal Mu Guiying first,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.040
or I won't lift a finger.

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:55.790
OK. I will set out at once.

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:59.415
Wenguang, Mother, Grandmother,
let's go together.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:00.749
Are you dreaming?

01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:03.457
You will go by yourself.

01:19:03.541 --> 01:19:07.040
The others must stay here
and wait for you to return.

01:19:07.125 --> 01:19:08.457
You...

01:19:13.583 --> 01:19:15.207
Just go, Zongbao.

01:19:15.666 --> 01:19:18.082
We'll be here waiting
for your safe return.

01:19:42.666 --> 01:19:43.957
Zongbao,

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:50.165
do you still remember the words
you said to me on the evening

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:53.540
you left for the battlefield
after we got married?

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:57.832
I remember that I told you

01:19:58.958 --> 01:20:03.207
to look at the moon when you miss me.

01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:09.207
What did you say before "moon"?

01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:13.457
I said, "stars".

01:20:17.416 --> 01:20:19.290
That day was Valentine's Day.

01:20:20.291 --> 01:20:23.499
The night sky was very clear.

01:20:25.916 --> 01:20:27.999
I asked you not to worry about me.

01:20:29.708 --> 01:20:31.165
I said I was the god of war

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:35.707
and I would come back to you
after I achieved my victories in battle,

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:40.290
even if it was only once a year.

01:20:41.416 --> 01:20:44.832
But have you kept your promise
of coming back to me each year?

01:20:48.791 --> 01:20:51.290
Zongbao, don't feel guilty.

01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:52.915
I'm not complaining.

01:20:54.291 --> 01:20:56.915
Not everybody has the opportunity
to sacrifice his own family's happiness

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.082
in order to protect the country.

01:20:59.916 --> 01:21:01.915
I feel very proud of you.

01:21:02.208 --> 01:21:05.790
I'm honoured to be your wife.

01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:09.915
I'll be yours forever.

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:14.124
I have a wish.

01:21:15.666 --> 01:21:18.374
If I cannot spend my life with you,

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:22.957
I'd rather die together with you
on the battlefield.

01:21:24.583 --> 01:21:28.790
How wonderful!
This dream can come true today.

01:21:34.625 --> 01:21:38.082
All of a sudden, I feel a huge weight
lifted off my shoulders.

01:21:50.958 --> 01:21:53.207
Let me see you again face-to-face

01:21:54.458 --> 01:21:56.957
and look into your eyes.

01:21:59.083 --> 01:22:04.332
I want to be able to recognise you
in the next life.

01:22:17.541 --> 01:22:18.999
Report!

01:22:24.791 --> 01:22:25.832
Speak!

01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:27.290
Marshal! The Western Xia's
70,000 soldiers

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:28.790
have joined up with Yin Qi's
20,000 cavalrymen.

01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:32.207
They are marching towards Huangtu Town
and will arrive after midday.

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:34.749
Deliver my orders.

01:22:34.833 --> 01:22:37.207
- Continue as planned.
- Yes!

01:22:40.291 --> 01:22:42.915
Grandmother, is this chilli powder
actually explosive?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.040
Of course not.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:47.165
- Then what is it for?
- It will be used to make our enemies weep.

01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:01.207
One against ten? One against ten?

01:23:01.291 --> 01:23:03.499
We cannot die until we finish the task.

01:23:04.083 --> 01:23:07.207
Die? Can't we win the battle?

01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:33.207
We have sabotaged all the catapults!

01:23:33.291 --> 01:23:35.624
Good! Take care, and play it by ear.

01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:36.999
OK!

01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:11.832
Marshal!
When shall we launch the attack?

01:24:11.916 --> 01:24:13.874
- Wait.
- Wait?

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:16.874
Wait for what?
We have no supporting troops!

01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:21.832
Fire!

01:24:22.416 --> 01:24:23.665
The pegs are stuck.

01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:26.832
Report! The catapults aren't functioning.

01:24:26.916 --> 01:24:28.207
Son of a bitch!

01:24:29.625 --> 01:24:31.040
Attack the wall directly!

01:24:31.125 --> 01:24:33.124
Attack!

01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:38.790
Guiying! Don't wait!

01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:40.207
We must wait!

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:46.499
Bowmen, prepare to shoot!

01:24:46.958 --> 01:24:48.249
Shoot!

01:24:50.541 --> 01:24:51.874
Take cover!

01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:59.165
Attack!

01:25:03.875 --> 01:25:05.290
Mother! We can't wait any longer!

01:25:05.375 --> 01:25:07.540
We have no weapons to defend the town.

01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:09.040
No, we must wait!

01:25:09.125 --> 01:25:11.374
This will reduce our casualties.

01:25:15.375 --> 01:25:16.665
Prepare to shoot!

01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:18.040
Shoot!

01:25:18.875 --> 01:25:21.124
Miss Paifeng, why don't we go outside
and meet the enemy?

01:25:21.208 --> 01:25:22.582
What are we holding brooms for?

01:25:22.666 --> 01:25:23.874
What are we waiting for?

01:25:23.958 --> 01:25:25.290
We're waiting for the wind.

01:25:32.875 --> 01:25:34.290
Open the gate!

01:25:49.625 --> 01:25:54.999
Attack!

01:26:25.583 --> 01:26:27.165
Bowmen, prepare to shoot!

01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:29.415
Marshal, we will end up shooting
our own people!

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:30.540
Shoot!

01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:32.415
Marshal, we have more people
there than they have!

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.374
That's why they can't afford it! Shoot!

01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:40.874
Wuniang, watch out!

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.499
Grandmother!

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.540
Kill them all!

01:26:59.125 --> 01:27:01.499
Guiying, we are outnumbered.

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.082
If this goes on, we will lose.

01:27:03.166 --> 01:27:04.290
Then what shall we do?

01:27:04.375 --> 01:27:06.499
Capture Yin Qi first!

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.332
Buddha's Palm Formation!

01:27:18.458 --> 01:27:19.999
Troops, listen up!

01:27:20.083 --> 01:27:22.874
We shall break into sections,
and target Yin Qi.

01:27:22.958 --> 01:27:25.874
Cut off his head,
and we can end the war.

01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:28.499
- Understand?
- Yes!

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.124
- Light the lanterns.
- Yes!

01:27:43.583 --> 01:27:47.665
- What's that?
- What's that?

01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:49.707
Zhuifeng, Zhuiying, shoot!

01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:56.332
It's pepper!

01:27:58.041 --> 01:27:59.290
Charge!

01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:01.749
Attack!

01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:22.290
- A ballista!
- Were they not destroyed?

01:28:36.583 --> 01:28:37.957
Snake Formation.

01:28:42.625 --> 01:28:44.749
- Serpent Spits Out Its Tongue!
- Yes!

01:28:49.333 --> 01:28:50.790
What's that they are using?

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.290
Go! It's our turn!

01:29:04.416 --> 01:29:06.082
- Yes!
- Come on!

01:29:17.625 --> 01:29:19.540
Yuanyang!

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.290
Mudan!

01:29:47.333 --> 01:29:48.749
Erniang, pay attention!

01:29:55.083 --> 01:29:56.665
Erniang, go quickly! OK!

01:30:17.625 --> 01:30:19.499
What's going on?

01:30:19.625 --> 01:30:22.040
- I'll check at once!
- Report!

01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:25.290
Spit it out!

01:30:25.375 --> 01:30:26.915
The Yang family generals
are coming to kill you!

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.290
What?

01:30:32.083 --> 01:30:34.290
- Yang Zongbao?
- Right you are!

01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:38.540
- We're also citizens of Song!
- Right.

01:30:38.625 --> 01:30:41.874
Song citizens? Great! Kill them all!

01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:43.582
Attack!

01:30:50.458 --> 01:30:53.582
- The Fairy Scatters Flowers!
- Attack!

01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:39.040
- Erniang.
- Zongbao.

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:41.790
Yang Zongbao!

01:33:43.375 --> 01:33:45.207
You're next!

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.790
Attack!

01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:59.915
- Guiying.
- I said I'd die with you on the battlefield!

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.957
OK, then let's go out with a bang!

01:34:11.708 --> 01:34:14.415
Report!

01:34:15.875 --> 01:34:18.249
Marshal, the battle has commenced
at Huangtu Town.

01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:21.915
Mu Guiying is leading the soldiers
to fight outside the town.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.624
It seems that the odds are against them.

01:34:26.875 --> 01:34:30.207
Let's see how the Yang female generals
carve their names in history!

01:34:30.291 --> 01:34:31.790
You're so sinister!

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.249
Didn't you hear the agreement
between me and Yang Zongbao?

01:34:36.083 --> 01:34:39.207
I'll send reinforcements
as soon as he finishes his task!

01:34:39.291 --> 01:34:40.957
Grandmother, Grandmother.

01:34:41.041 --> 01:34:43.457
Must we wait for Mother's death
and do nothing?

01:34:43.666 --> 01:34:45.957
Is reputation so important
for the Yang family?

01:34:46.083 --> 01:34:47.415
Great Grandmother!

01:35:01.833 --> 01:35:03.124
Listen!

01:35:03.666 --> 01:35:07.540
I have the decree of immunity
from the law from Emperor Taizu.

01:35:07.958 --> 01:35:10.915
Now that I have taken down
this incapable marshal,

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.040
I will accept any
and all of the consequences.

01:35:13.125 --> 01:35:15.499
This has nothing
to do with the Yang family.

01:35:17.833 --> 01:35:19.207
Taijun,

01:35:19.458 --> 01:35:21.290
since we have no leader now,

01:35:21.375 --> 01:35:23.374
and the front line is in danger

01:35:24.041 --> 01:35:27.540
I humbly request that
you take charge of the troops.

01:35:27.625 --> 01:35:30.499
The military seal for
dispatching the troops is here.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.999
Please send the troops at once.

01:35:34.958 --> 01:35:38.457
Liu Fu! Traitor! I will not spare you!

01:35:38.875 --> 01:35:40.915
It is the Yang family that will not spare you!

01:36:18.958 --> 01:36:21.457
- We're on the same side!
- We're not the enemy.

01:36:28.875 --> 01:36:30.957
Report!

01:36:33.125 --> 01:36:36.499
Yang Wenguang is attacking our left flank
with a large number of soldiers!

01:36:38.958 --> 01:36:41.624
Fine! Let Yang Wenguang come!

01:36:57.791 --> 01:37:01.832
Seems that my arrow
is more powerful than your spear!

01:37:01.916 --> 01:37:02.957
You!

01:37:03.041 --> 01:37:08.540
Father, Mother.
I'm coming with reinforcements!

01:37:08.625 --> 01:37:10.790
Wenguang! Great!

01:37:10.875 --> 01:37:14.165
Guiying, Wenguang is here
with reinforcements.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.249
We're sure to win this battle!

01:37:16.333 --> 01:37:17.707
Hold on, Guiying!

01:37:17.916 --> 01:37:19.749
Troops, listen carefully!

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:22.207
Unless I order you otherwise,
stand your ground!

01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:25.374
- I'll send him to hell myself.
- Yes!

01:39:35.833 --> 01:39:38.332
- You...
- Bajie, we're on the same side!

01:39:44.208 --> 01:39:46.707
- Wenguang, kill him!
- Father!

01:40:02.208 --> 01:40:03.707
Father!

01:40:04.083 --> 01:40:06.124
Wenguang, go and check on Bajie.

01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:08.207
Mother! Take care of Father!

01:40:10.708 --> 01:40:13.374
- Grandmother...are you OK?
- Wenguang!

01:40:13.458 --> 01:40:14.749
Don't worry about me!

01:40:15.125 --> 01:40:16.457
Guiying!

01:40:17.708 --> 01:40:19.415
I owe you so much.

01:40:20.541 --> 01:40:25.249
In the next life, I will repay you!

01:40:38.458 --> 01:40:40.749
You will surely
have the chance to repay me

01:40:41.458 --> 01:40:46.290
because I'll be your wife
in the next life, too!

01:40:52.625 --> 01:40:53.915
Father!

01:40:55.250 --> 01:40:56.582
Mother!

01:40:57.208 --> 01:40:58.749
Father!

01:40:58.833 --> 01:41:02.249
Mother!

01:41:02.333 --> 01:41:05.332
Why do we have to part so quickly
after we have reunited?

01:41:19.875 --> 01:41:21.249
Liuniang!

01:41:21.333 --> 01:41:30.790
Stop fighting! Yin Qi's head is here!

01:41:31.666 --> 01:41:35.332
We won!
We can go home! We can go home!

01:41:35.625 --> 01:41:37.290
Grandmother! Are you OK?

01:41:37.416 --> 01:41:38.457
I'm fine.

01:41:38.541 --> 01:41:39.915
We won!

01:41:39.916 --> 01:41:42.957
Yes! This war is finally over!

01:41:47.041 --> 01:41:51.540
We won!

01:41:53.166 --> 01:41:54.790
We've finally won the war!

01:42:04.333 --> 01:42:05.624
Liuniang!

01:42:05.708 --> 01:42:07.124
Princess...

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.332
Grandmother!

01:42:12.833 --> 01:42:15.207
Mother and Father have both died!

01:42:16.375 --> 01:42:17.999
Don't cry, Wenguang.

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:21.582
We have won the battle.

01:42:21.583 --> 01:42:22.957
Zongbao and Guiying

01:42:23.666 --> 01:42:28.665
will be reunited in heaven.

01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:30.040
Husband...

01:42:30.916 --> 01:42:36.624
Zongbao's death will not be the end.

01:42:38.458 --> 01:42:40.082
Please rest assured.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.040
LOYAL FAMILY

01:42:42.125 --> 01:42:44.957
So long as the war drum
continues to sound,

01:42:45.041 --> 01:42:49.707
the Yangs' heartbeat will continue
to be felt on every battlefield!

01:42:50.375 --> 01:43:09.332
Huaiyu.

01:43:10.041 --> 01:43:11.665
You're one year old today.

01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:14.290
I'll let you make this decision.

01:43:15.541 --> 01:43:17.624
If you choose this sword,

01:43:17.708 --> 01:43:19.790
you continue our family tradition

01:43:19.916 --> 01:43:23.790
and become a fearless warrior!

01:43:28.166 --> 01:43:32.165
Huaiyu, isn't it beautiful?

01:43:32.250 --> 01:43:36.790
If you choose this jade carving, Taijun will
let you break away from the family tradition

01:43:36.875 --> 01:43:39.707
and allow you to follow a political career.

01:43:39.708 --> 01:43:41.040
Take a look.

01:43:41.458 --> 01:43:43.124
Eunuch Li has arrived!

01:43:48.666 --> 01:43:50.874
Here is the imperial edict.

01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:54.749
According to the emperor's will,

01:43:54.833 --> 01:43:57.999
I proclaim Yang Wenguang as the
Assistant Marshal of the Westward March.

01:43:58.083 --> 01:44:02.415
Wenguang is to assist Marshal Di Qing
and leave for the border at once.

01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.624
You must not delay. This edict
comes directly from the emperor.

01:44:05.708 --> 01:44:07.499
I am honoured to accept this edict.

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.290
My gratitude, Your Majesty.

01:44:11.916 --> 01:44:19.415
Smoke pops up in the desert
The sound of the flute resonates

01:44:20.125 --> 01:44:23.957
And covers 1 ,000 miles to the front lines

01:44:24.041 --> 01:44:28.374
Red sleeves dance with golden spears

01:44:28.458 --> 01:44:35.957
Love for home, hatred for the enemy
Tears pour down

01:44:36.541 --> 01:44:40.582
Serve the country and kill the invaders

01:44:40.666 --> 01:44:44.707
Love is deep and tender

01:44:44.791 --> 01:44:48.332
The heroine is buried in sand

01:45:18.541 --> 01:45:20.707
This wound was caused by the sabre.

01:45:21.125 --> 01:45:22.915
- Will it heal quickly?
-Yes, it will, hold this.

01:45:23.416 --> 01:45:25.332
He actually hit my leg!

01:45:25.958 --> 01:45:27.915
- Will it heal quickly?
- Yes, it will, hold this.

01:45:30.291 --> 01:45:31.582
It's so windy!

01:45:34.208 --> 01:45:35.499
It's freezing!

01:45:42.916 --> 01:45:44.707
Do you feel dizzy?

01:45:44.958 --> 01:45:47.082
No, but it hurts a little.

01:45:47.625 --> 01:45:49.374
Do you feel dizzy?

01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:51.915
No, but it hurts a little.

01:46:00.083 --> 01:46:01.540
Attack!

01:46:19.625 --> 01:46:21.874
One, two, three!

01:47:39.916 --> 01:47:42.040
If a man gets wounded,
don't worry about it.

01:47:42.250 --> 01:47:44.415
You will remember Tianmen forever.

01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:47.415
Ah, shit!
