01:47.569 --> 01:49.735
When I was little,

01:49.903 --> 01:54.444
my mum and I loved to sit
and look at the night sky.

01:55.861 --> 01:57.986
We dreamed that we were not alone,

02:00.278 --> 02:03.152
that the stars were
the eyes of the angels

02:03.320 --> 02:05.361
who were watching over us.

02:06.736 --> 02:11.026
But when Mum fell ill,
none of them helped.

02:12.611 --> 02:15.568
And so I realized that
there's nothing out there,

02:17.070 --> 02:22.527
except silence, emptiness and cold.

02:23.195 --> 02:24.610
Let's go.

02:25.070 --> 02:26.152
Quiet!

02:26.320 --> 02:29.236
Charl, what are you looking at?
There's nothing there.

02:29.404 --> 02:30.652
Come on, let's go!

03:49.736 --> 03:53.361
For most of history, people
have feared meteor showers.

03:53.861 --> 03:57.194
Only recently have we begun
to understand these visitors

03:57.362 --> 03:59.652
who penetrates the earth's atmosphere.

03:59.820 --> 04:05.486
Earlier on, these cosmic stones were
associated with the wrath of God.

04:05.653 --> 04:07.277
How are things with you?

04:08.070 --> 04:09.819
Why don't you tell me?

04:09.987 --> 04:13.568
I'll get together with some Albert,
and won't tell a thing about it.

04:13.736 --> 04:16.403
- There's nothing to tell.
- Nothing, really?

04:17.153 --> 04:19.944
What's going on between you two?
Where do you... you know?

04:20.112 --> 04:24.486
If I knew such a Romeo,
I'd run away from home.

04:24.653 --> 04:25.652
Maybe.

04:25.820 --> 04:30.568
But Tyoma thinks of Romeo only as
a make of car, if you see what I mean.

04:30.736 --> 04:35.819
And today we are witnessing a
unique astronomical phenomenon.

04:36.445 --> 04:38.111
Mironov...

04:38.820 --> 04:40.752
Good Morning.
Did you sleep well?

04:40.820 --> 04:43.069
- Why Mironov?
- Just because. Don't sleep!

04:43.237 --> 04:44.361
Who can tell me

04:44.528 --> 04:46.694
where and when occurred
the last meteor shower,

04:46.861 --> 04:50.194
that had a magnitude comparable to
what's expected today.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.403
In China.

04:52.569 --> 04:53.694
'76.

04:54.487 --> 04:57.944
Yulia. Are you having a
scientific debate?

04:58.112 --> 05:00.777
- A scientific debate, exactly.
- And?

05:00.945 --> 05:04.944
Google says in China, in 1976.

05:05.362 --> 05:06.486
Google is right.

05:06.653 --> 05:09.194
The most terrible events in
human history

05:09.362 --> 05:11.978
have happened when men
faced something...

05:12.202 --> 05:13.270
Unknown...

05:14.270 --> 05:15.368
Frightening.

05:15.369 --> 05:19.576
The bloodiest crusades were
triggered by meteor showers.

05:20.861 --> 05:23.194
And then what happened, Mironov?!

05:24.487 --> 05:26.610
I'm not sleeping, I'm listening.

05:26.778 --> 05:27.944
Google.

05:28.653 --> 05:32.194
All the crusaders, about 300,000
people, died in the desert.

05:32.611 --> 05:33.777
Yes. Yes.

05:33.945 --> 05:35.152
The brain!

05:35.237 --> 05:37.519
And this despite the fact that

05:37.561 --> 05:40.345
these meteor showers, in scale,
don't compare with today's.

05:40.353 --> 05:42.727
And us here... won't we also...?

05:43.903 --> 05:45.319
Are you crazy?

05:49.861 --> 05:51.152
I hope not.

05:51.778 --> 05:55.277
The debris will burn up in the upper
atmosphere, don't be afraid.

05:55.445 --> 05:57.361
Tonight, watch the shooting stars!

05:57.528 --> 05:58.277
Did you hear?

05:58.445 --> 05:59.944
- Yes!
- Take care!

06:00.112 --> 06:01.194
By the way...

06:02.362 --> 06:04.277
- What's this?
- Two concert tickets for Korzh.

06:04.445 --> 06:06.152
I thought you and I could go.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.486
But compared to your
Alfa Romeo's vroom vroom,

06:09.653 --> 06:11.860
I'm not really in the race.
- Thank you!

06:12.028 --> 06:13.319
- Bye!
- Bye!

06:13.487 --> 06:14.694
All the best!
The shooting stars tonight!

06:14.861 --> 06:16.735
- Yes! - Bye!
- Bye!

06:29.070 --> 06:32.610
- Give me your notebook, I'll correct it.
- Were you a good student?

06:35.861 --> 06:37.652
I'll call you.

06:41.195 --> 06:42.194
Hi.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.403
Well then...

06:55.195 --> 06:56.194
Dad?

06:57.195 --> 06:58.652
Hi! It's me.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.527
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:02.736 --> 07:04.403
I'm home just for a few seconds.

07:06.195 --> 07:08.152
Do you know where
the binoculars are?

07:08.320 --> 07:09.902
I'll be home late tonight.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.568
Don't leave the apartment.

07:11.736 --> 07:14.111
But we're all meeting at
the parking lot.

07:14.278 --> 07:16.568
- It's the best spot to see the meteors.
- No.

07:18.569 --> 07:20.860
Definitely no?

07:21.028 --> 07:23.277
Is there any weighty arguments?

07:23.445 --> 07:25.111
Convincing reasons?

07:25.278 --> 07:28.403
Crowds of people on a
roof with a low wall,

07:28.569 --> 07:30.610
most of them drunk.

07:31.820 --> 07:34.236
I think the argument is convincing.

07:35.487 --> 07:38.319
Dad, I won't be alone.
Tyoma is waiting for me.

07:39.070 --> 07:40.819
- Artyom?
- Yes.

07:42.569 --> 07:43.902
Then, certainly, no!

07:49.362 --> 07:50.610
Great!

07:50.778 --> 07:52.610
I don't mean to pressure you, but

07:52.778 --> 07:56.027
a meteor shower like that won't
occur again for maybe 50 years.

07:56.195 --> 07:57.403
I'm not coming.

07:59.404 --> 08:02.568
- Did Comrade Colonel forbid you to go out?
- He never leaves me alone!

08:02.736 --> 08:05.860
I wish they'd sent him somewhere.
On a business trip.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.027
To Jupiter!

08:08.820 --> 08:11.319
He just left. I saw him.

08:11.487 --> 08:13.819
So, I see no problem.

08:13.987 --> 08:16.194
I'm ready to rescue my
princess from the tower.

08:42.404 --> 08:44.193
Unidentified flying object detected.

08:44.362 --> 08:47.236
Bearing 340, distance 280.

08:47.404 --> 08:49.735
The flying object doesn't answer.

08:51.195 --> 08:54.735
The object came from the west.
It's now just north of Finland.

08:56.070 --> 08:59.027
- What kind of object?
- It was just detected.

09:00.528 --> 09:02.568
Very large, moves in our direction.

09:02.736 --> 09:04.527
- Roger that.
- Speed?

09:06.861 --> 09:10.403
- Speed is erratic.
- Erratic? Are they in trouble?

09:10.569 --> 09:14.069
Not yet ascertained.
It moves at between 500 and 900 km/h.

09:14.237 --> 09:17.352
- Strategic partners were consulted?
- Yes! They don't know.

09:17.353 --> 09:19.518
Lithuania and Latvia
are also on standby.

09:19.653 --> 09:22.986
But if this thing doesn't slow down,
they won't even have time to take off.

09:24.487 --> 09:26.944
<i>Bearing 190.
The object has passed the coast.</i>

09:27.112 --> 09:30.527
<i>It's big. Keeping visual contact.</i>

09:31.778 --> 09:34.735
Deploy interceptors.
Activate missile defence.

09:34.903 --> 09:37.486
Notify the Ministry and let them
announce the state of emergency.

09:50.927 --> 09:51.960
<i>Ready!</i>

09:52.028 --> 09:54.777
<i>477 is in the air!</i>

09:54.945 --> 09:56.902
477 to Atlanta, I'm on my way.

10:00.569 --> 10:03.361
<i>477 and 478 are on course.</i>

10:08.736 --> 10:11.361
Despite the high-rise buildings,
we have a good view of the sky.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.944
And there's much to see today!

10:14.112 --> 10:15.735
The north-east of the capital is cloudy,

10:15.903 --> 10:18.568
<i>so many came here, south of Moscow,</i>

10:18.736 --> 10:20.319
<i>to watch this celestial show.</i>

10:22.820 --> 10:24.444
Don't listen to this drivel!

10:28.153 --> 10:29.902
Fuck off!

10:33.237 --> 10:38.444
<i>As you can see, some are already beginning
to celebrate this rare natural event...</i>

10:38.611 --> 10:40.277
<i>Crap! Let's do it again!</i>

10:40.445 --> 10:41.568
Leave it!

10:41.736 --> 10:44.361
I'm just going to adjust his mirrors.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.486
Hey, what's that bullshit?!

10:52.820 --> 10:55.111
There are pedestrians around here!

10:57.404 --> 10:59.277
What the hell?!

11:00.320 --> 11:01.777
Do you need help, Tyoma?

11:08.820 --> 11:11.069
All right, guys.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.111
There's no need!

11:14.569 --> 11:15.777
Hi!

11:16.945 --> 11:19.444
- Guess what I got.
- What's this?

11:19.611 --> 11:21.860
A ticket for the VIP box!

11:24.903 --> 11:26.236
<i>477. 10 on the left.</i>

11:26.653 --> 11:28.944
Roger that. Have visual contact.

11:33.028 --> 11:34.902
This is crazy!

11:35.070 --> 11:37.194
Repeat, 477.

11:37.445 --> 11:39.361
<i>It's huge!</i>

11:45.070 --> 11:47.069
- Yulia.
- Yes?

11:47.237 --> 11:48.902
I think we're in the way.

11:49.445 --> 11:50.694
- We?
- We!

11:50.861 --> 11:53.444
Don't you see she wants to be alone?

11:54.028 --> 11:55.652
- Uh, no.
- Yes.

11:55.820 --> 11:58.551
She's my girlfriend and
I'm not leaving her alone.

12:01.695 --> 12:05.336
Take it! You're so annoying!
Go. No one's there. I live alone.

12:05.404 --> 12:06.777
Oh what a beauty!

12:06.945 --> 12:09.944
"Oh what a beauty!"
You have no idea what's beautiful!

12:10.112 --> 12:11.610
You'll miss this.

12:11.778 --> 12:13.860
We're in a Moscow inner courtyard,

12:14.028 --> 12:16.486
and right behind me, you
can see the meteor shower.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.444
Show me another one.

12:19.111 --> 12:20.110
Yes.

12:34.195 --> 12:37.194
Be quiet!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

12:50.153 --> 12:52.752
<i>Base to 477. The aim is to disable it.</i>

12:52.820 --> 12:54.860
<i>477 to base. I hear you.</i>

12:55.028 --> 12:57.694
<i>477, fire then bank to the left.</i>

13:00.153 --> 13:04.986
- And if it's not NATO?
- How could it not? See any force field?

13:13.695 --> 13:15.777
<i>477, was the target hit?</i>

13:20.861 --> 13:24.027
<i>Yup! It's losing speed.</i>

13:26.237 --> 13:28.403
<i>477 to base. I'm losing control!</i>

13:28.861 --> 13:30.735
<i>477, self-eject!</i>

13:36.695 --> 13:39.194
Sveta stayed there alone.
I can't do this.

13:39.362 --> 13:41.486
She's your friend, she can wait.

13:42.653 --> 13:46.152
Can I at least call her briefly?
Please, Tyoma!

15:19.736 --> 15:22.111
Yulia! Hold tight!

15:51.487 --> 15:53.236
Hold tight!

16:30.237 --> 16:32.403
Intelligence is almost there.

16:32.569 --> 16:34.819
They should report in a few minutes.

16:34.987 --> 16:36.986
The Tech unit is also on its way.

16:37.153 --> 16:39.277
- Do you hear me?
- Yes I'm listening.

16:39.445 --> 16:41.543
- Protective clothing, Colonel.
- I don't need it.

16:41.611 --> 16:43.236
Be careful.

16:43.404 --> 16:46.403
You understand,
who knows what this thing is?

16:47.028 --> 16:49.152
And here's another great news.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.002
A deputy from the parliamentary
group is going with you.

16:52.070 --> 16:54.361
- What's that about?
- It's necessary.

16:55.487 --> 16:57.527
He wants to see the impact zone.

16:57.695 --> 17:00.694
Is this really XL?
Yes, it's wide enough.

17:23.653 --> 17:25.593
The world's attention is riveted

17:25.661 --> 17:27.952
on the events unfolding in Moscow.

17:28.020 --> 17:31.610
We managed to get through to
Mikhail Poleskin, State Duma deputy,

17:31.677 --> 17:34.593
who plans to personally inspect
the scene of the crash.

17:34.661 --> 17:37.494
Mikhail Petrovich, where are
you and what has happened?

17:37.561 --> 17:40.436
<i>At the moment, I am still</i>
on the way to the crash site.

17:40.503 --> 17:42.502
There is no reason to claim that

17:42.569 --> 17:45.652
we're dealing here with an
object of extraterrestrial origin.

17:45.820 --> 17:48.277
But if this assumption
were confirmed,

17:48.445 --> 17:51.352
this event would certainly
go down in history.

17:54.736 --> 17:57.568
17 teams are already on the ground
and 4 are close to Chertanovo.

17:57.736 --> 18:01.319
- One is on the road with dogs.
- Mobilize all reservists!

18:06.278 --> 18:07.944
Take the girl!

18:12.320 --> 18:13.319
Yulia!

18:13.861 --> 18:15.902
Yulia, look at me!

18:16.070 --> 18:17.069
Yulia!

18:17.611 --> 18:19.027
Stop!

18:20.820 --> 18:23.652
- Are you tired of life?!
- Open the door, quickly!

18:25.153 --> 18:26.152
Yulia!

18:26.320 --> 18:29.027
Do you hear me? Stay with me!

18:29.736 --> 18:31.860
- Come on, come on!
- Carefully!

18:39.112 --> 18:42.652
Of course, it's not safe. You never
know what's inside this thing.

18:42.820 --> 18:47.111
There could be a nuclear reactor
and a second Chernobyl awaiting us.

18:47.278 --> 18:50.986
Why did they chose you for contact?
Was this a committee decision?

18:51.153 --> 18:55.403
No, I volunteered and the
Ministry of Defence agreed.

18:56.404 --> 18:57.986
Hello? Can you hear me?

18:58.362 --> 19:00.486
Did you activate the jammers already?

19:00.653 --> 19:03.069
- Can you stop where there's reception?
- No.

19:03.903 --> 19:05.444
But it's a live broadcast!

19:05.611 --> 19:07.777
Mikhail Petrovich, can you hear us?

19:08.861 --> 19:10.786
Unfortunately, we lost the connection.

19:11.153 --> 19:13.877
Let me remind you that, about an hour ago,

19:13.878 --> 19:16.701
a catastrophic incident occurred
in Chertanovo.

19:16.702 --> 19:20.656
An unidentified object crashed
in a residential tower complex.

19:20.657 --> 19:23.475
The number of victims is yet
to be determined.

19:23.544 --> 19:26.507
The Atlantic Alliance is currently
negotiating with Moscow

19:26.508 --> 19:28.009
for access to the site.

19:28.010 --> 19:31.092
Experts are reluctant to confirm
the reports of eye-witnesses

19:31.160 --> 19:34.585
to the effect that we're dealing
with an alien invasion.

19:34.652 --> 19:37.268
And yet, from different parts of the world

19:37.336 --> 19:40.461
come reports of armed forces
on high state of alert.

19:41.028 --> 19:44.885
Meanwhile, the streets adjacent to
the crash site are cordoned off.

19:44.953 --> 19:47.794
The Defence Ministry is so far
abstaining from comment.

19:47.861 --> 19:51.944
But local residents tell of tactical units
surrounding a strange sphere.

19:52.112 --> 19:55.610
Combat helicopters are also
hovering over the crashed object.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.444
<i>- What about radioactivity?
- In the normal range.</i>

20:04.611 --> 20:07.444
<i>There is no danger for people. Over.</i>

20:08.153 --> 20:09.944
<i>We'll keep monitoring. Over.</i>

20:13.611 --> 20:15.610
I'm in position. Everything's quiet.

20:16.362 --> 20:18.610
- Any visible activity?
- Nothing to see.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.211
We have contact.

20:39.153 --> 20:40.152
I see it.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.860
<i>The object is in my sight.</i>

20:42.028 --> 20:45.403
Well, it's time for
a welcome speech.

20:53.278 --> 20:54.986
I greet you.

20:59.487 --> 21:01.444
I'm Michael Poleskin,

21:01.611 --> 21:03.944
Member of Parliament.

21:05.404 --> 21:07.694
This is the representative
of the Ministry of Defence,

21:07.861 --> 21:11.777
responsible for the sector, so to speak...
Lebedev.

21:12.487 --> 21:14.819
You are called Lebedev?
- Lebedev.

21:15.569 --> 21:19.219
We are ready for fruitful cooperation.

21:19.978 --> 21:23.337
<i>The first step to which
has already been laid</i>

21:23.537 --> 21:27.369
in the course of our contribution
to your successful landing.

21:27.404 --> 21:28.902
So...

21:29.070 --> 21:30.652
Welcome to our Earth!

21:30.820 --> 21:32.027
Don't.

21:32.195 --> 21:34.152
No abrupt movements.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.444
<i>We got that.</i>
Ready to open fire.

21:46.611 --> 21:48.819
- Negative!
<i>- Roger that.</i>

21:56.611 --> 21:59.393
Report every detail. Subjectively.

21:59.528 --> 22:02.361
What you saw, felt, thought.

22:02.528 --> 22:06.777
They asked us not to come nearer.
They said we could avoid casualties,

22:06.945 --> 22:10.777
if we let them repair their
ship and leave our planet.

22:10.945 --> 22:13.111
What do you mean by "said"?
With words?

22:13.278 --> 22:16.694
- I'm not sure, but I understood.
- In what language did you speak?

22:17.695 --> 22:18.694
In Russian.

22:18.861 --> 22:21.902
What did they mean by "avoid casualties"?
Was that a threat?

22:22.070 --> 22:24.127
I don't think so.
I didn't sense aggression.

22:24.195 --> 22:25.986
Has anyone else heard
this conversation?

22:26.153 --> 22:28.735
- A deputy was with you.
- Yes. He's in intensive care.

22:28.736 --> 22:31.618
His pacemaker failed. Like all electronic
devices near the ship.

22:31.653 --> 22:35.902
I'm sorry, but what's stopping us
from carrying out an assault right now?

22:36.070 --> 22:39.602
I agree. We shot them down somehow,
so liquidation shouldn't be a problem...

22:39.669 --> 22:43.044
If we hadn't shot them down,
there wouldn't have been any victims.

22:43.569 --> 22:45.361
What do you suggest?

22:46.028 --> 22:48.819
Wait. Keep observing them.
Nothing more.

22:48.987 --> 22:51.777
The main thing now is
not to provoke aggression.

22:55.969 --> 22:57.094
Let's wait.

22:58.987 --> 23:00.744
For 3 days, the world's attention

23:00.745 --> 23:02.985
have been riveted on
the events in Moscow.

23:02.986 --> 23:06.792
The object is being examined by an
international group of experts.

23:06.793 --> 23:10.734
The UN Security Council has raised
concerns about the Moscow incident.

23:11.003 --> 23:16.478
A US government representative has demanded
immediate access to the crash site.

23:16.545 --> 23:19.860
The UN resolution however
was blocked by the Russian side.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.735
Woke up?

23:36.778 --> 23:38.777
- Yulia?
- Oh, hi.

23:39.195 --> 23:41.486
- How are you?
- My head hurts.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.694
Yeah... So, Yulia.

23:44.653 --> 23:45.652
Look here.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.027
Good.

23:52.278 --> 23:54.403
You shouldn't have taken
off the bandage.

23:54.569 --> 23:56.777
Lie down. I'll call your father.

23:56.945 --> 24:00.568
... Commander Lebedev is responsible for
the coordination of the armed forces.

24:00.736 --> 24:04.610
Within a radius of 1 km, protective
structures have been erected.

24:04.778 --> 24:07.361
The nearby streets are
closed to traffic,

24:07.528 --> 24:08.986
the residents have been evacuated

24:08.987 --> 24:11.619
although many have refused
to leave, fearing looting.

24:11.785 --> 24:15.681
The death tolls now stands at 232.
Dozens are listed as missing.

24:16.569 --> 24:18.152
Sveta...

24:43.945 --> 24:45.027
Tyoma.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.236
Did the doctor allow you to get up?

24:49.820 --> 24:51.111
She can wait.

25:24.153 --> 25:25.902
My little one, what is it?

25:26.070 --> 25:28.486
I'm with you! I'll always
be there, do you hear?

25:43.736 --> 25:44.735
Hop in!

25:47.362 --> 25:49.027
Thanks, Tyoma!

25:54.487 --> 25:56.319
Andrei, I'm driving!

25:56.413 --> 26:00.144
The doctor said she's OK, but
if her head starts spinning or hurting,

26:00.145 --> 26:02.935
- to come back at once.
- Thank you for taking her here.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.236
But without you...

26:05.778 --> 26:07.610
she wouldn't have been there.

26:10.112 --> 26:11.652
You're welcome.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.694
<i>... has rejected the proposal on the
participation of international experts</i>

26:32.861 --> 26:35.777
<i>in the study of the
crashed object in Moscow.</i>

26:35.945 --> 26:39.118
<i>The Russian president has
emphasized that our own experts</i>

26:39.186 --> 26:42.069
<i>have the skills and
technical equipment required</i>

26:42.237 --> 26:43.869
<i>to monitor the situation.</i>

26:43.937 --> 26:47.010
<i>The government spokesman has
stressed that today's talk</i>

26:47.078 --> 26:49.560
<i>occurred at the request of
the American side.</i>

26:59.450 --> 27:03.039
<i>In further news, more than
200 deaths have been reported.</i>

27:03.862 --> 27:06.160
The news said 200 people died.

27:06.903 --> 27:08.610
Is it true or a lie?

27:08.778 --> 27:09.944
True.

27:12.736 --> 27:14.236
Are we at war?

27:14.569 --> 27:17.610
Depends on how they behave.

27:19.653 --> 27:21.444
Who are they?

27:23.653 --> 27:24.986
Good question.

27:29.987 --> 27:32.194
THIS IS OUR EARTH!

27:41.028 --> 27:42.819
Dad?

27:42.987 --> 27:44.944
What will happen to us now?

27:45.112 --> 27:48.336
The city is under curfew. No
one is allowed out after 9pm.

27:48.404 --> 27:51.236
You come home immediately
after school. Is that clear?

27:52.362 --> 27:53.403
Yes sir!

27:53.569 --> 27:56.403
You know, Yulia, I've got
enough to do at the moment.

27:56.569 --> 27:58.403
I cannot watch you all the time.

27:58.569 --> 28:01.942
Can you, for once in your
life, help me? Just help me?!

28:03.237 --> 28:04.610
You're welcome.

28:34.487 --> 28:36.194
Well finally!

28:36.362 --> 28:37.819
- Good day.
- Hi.

28:37.987 --> 28:39.236
Hi grandma!

28:39.404 --> 28:41.486
How many times have I asked you?

28:41.653 --> 28:44.735
Just say Ljuba.
I don't like that word.

28:44.903 --> 28:46.403
How are you, sweety?

28:46.569 --> 28:49.069
He got you here, did he not,
so I wouldn't run away?

28:49.237 --> 28:51.902
Not at all. Your father wanted
to send you to Krasnodar.

28:52.070 --> 28:54.860
- Say thanks, I was against it.
- That's typical of him.

28:55.028 --> 28:58.111
His panacea in every thorny
situation: Out of sight, out of mind!

28:58.278 --> 29:00.909
But it's not settled yet.
You might still go.

29:00.910 --> 29:03.534
Send me wherever
you want, I don't care.

29:04.145 --> 29:06.527
Yulia, what's your WiFi password?

29:06.695 --> 29:09.919
I want to post a photo I took of
the UFO, while it's still of interest.

29:09.987 --> 29:13.403
Should be nine, nine times,
but officially, I don't know.

29:13.569 --> 29:17.860
At the barracks, the commander only
gives the WiFi password for good behaviour.

29:18.028 --> 29:20.277
Excuse me, I have to go.

29:20.445 --> 29:24.277
Then go. Go fight your aliens.

29:24.445 --> 29:27.444
- You're better at that.
- Thank you for coming.

29:41.706 --> 29:43.704
SCHOOL 1191

29:45.028 --> 29:47.902
Hi Yulia! Transport is free.

29:49.695 --> 29:52.568
- If you please!
- So, that's how it's going to be?

29:52.736 --> 29:54.027
Cool! Hi!

29:54.195 --> 29:55.777
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:56.611 --> 29:57.610
Hi.

30:04.611 --> 30:06.111
How are you?

30:09.153 --> 30:10.194
Fine.

30:41.695 --> 30:45.986
Guys. I perfectly understand
how hard it is for you.

30:46.820 --> 30:49.610
We all have lost loved ones, friends.

30:51.903 --> 30:55.902
But despite the bitterness of loss,
one cannot give in to anger.

30:56.778 --> 30:59.027
You cannot. People.

31:00.028 --> 31:05.777
For thousands of years, we've waited for a
encounter with an extraterrestrial civilisation.

31:05.945 --> 31:07.277
That's ended now!

31:07.445 --> 31:11.027
We have no idea what moral
standards the newcomers have,

31:11.195 --> 31:14.144
what they think about life, death.
Do they understand the pain of loss?

31:14.145 --> 31:16.601
If they don't, why should
we explain it to them?

31:16.736 --> 31:18.860
Why should we establish contact?

31:19.028 --> 31:20.986
Why can't we just get rid of them?

31:21.153 --> 31:23.194
Because this is a unique
chance for all mankind.

31:23.362 --> 31:26.819
A chance to die?! To give
your house to some freaks?

31:29.070 --> 31:32.236
A chance to learn
something about ourselves.

31:32.404 --> 31:37.111
To find out who we are.
Maybe even... to find a home.

31:37.278 --> 31:39.902
I know all about myself. I'm home!

31:40.070 --> 31:42.194
- And I didn't invite them in!
- Yulia...

31:42.362 --> 31:46.361
If not for them, everything would be
fine. And Sveta would be alive!

31:46.528 --> 31:47.735
Yulia...

32:13.903 --> 32:16.534
<i>In the service of the Motherland
Lebedev V. Yu.</i>

32:25.112 --> 32:27.486
Guys, check out this video
posted on VKontakte.

32:27.653 --> 32:28.652
Come here, Python!

32:37.070 --> 32:38.319
Go back to the start.

32:38.487 --> 32:40.236
Wait, there's more.

32:40.404 --> 32:41.652
Nits!

32:43.153 --> 32:44.960
Acting as if they were at home!

32:45.028 --> 32:48.194
Almost a billion clicks.
- The whole world is watching.

32:48.362 --> 32:51.585
Let's see how many will be left
when these blood suckers spread.

32:51.653 --> 32:53.777
You think they'll break out of the cordon?

32:54.237 --> 32:57.444
What do you think they're here for?
To hang around the fence?

32:57.611 --> 33:02.986
Hey, we could repost the videos.
With negative comments.

33:03.153 --> 33:05.986
We could start a trend on the Net.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.944
Very brave, guys! Well done!

33:09.861 --> 33:11.027
Yulia?

33:11.487 --> 33:13.777
All you can do is post, re-tweet and like.

33:13.945 --> 33:16.652
- Listen, friend. Watch your tongue,
- Sit down!

33:16.820 --> 33:19.403
Sit down? Tell this bimbo to sit down.

33:20.653 --> 33:22.735
She's not a bimbo, she's my girl.

33:22.903 --> 33:24.152
Oh yes?

33:25.528 --> 33:27.111
She looks like a bimbo to me.

33:27.778 --> 33:28.860
Calm down!

33:29.028 --> 33:31.027
- Come here!
- Stop it!

33:32.404 --> 33:33.944
That's enough!

33:34.112 --> 33:35.111
Break it off!

33:35.278 --> 33:37.568
She's my girl, is that clear?!

33:37.736 --> 33:39.403
And I love her, you understand?

33:39.569 --> 33:42.319
Or do I have to say it again, huh?

33:43.528 --> 33:46.194
And I love you! Is that clear?

33:48.903 --> 33:50.319
Idiot!

33:55.362 --> 33:57.568
- What are you going to do?
- What do you suggest?

33:57.736 --> 34:00.444
Go there to prove who's
in charge in the district?

34:00.611 --> 34:03.694
- Yes!
- Opa, opa, opa!

34:03.903 --> 34:05.319
America, Europa!

34:05.487 --> 34:07.652
And what about the cordon?

34:07.820 --> 34:10.360
I mean, if the soldiers weren't
there, I would go myself.

34:10.527 --> 34:13.444
We can't just sit around and
wait. After what they did.

34:13.610 --> 34:15.360
We shouldn't, Tyoma.

34:15.860 --> 34:16.946
Of course.

34:18.369 --> 34:20.067
And we won't.

34:22.112 --> 34:25.152
There's a way in I'm sure
the soldiers don't know.

34:26.487 --> 34:32.235
<i>A fortified fence has been
erected in this district.</i>

34:32.404 --> 34:35.610
<i>Unauthorized access to
the enclosed area...</i>

34:47.820 --> 34:50.944
Curfew in half an hour.
Let's go, boys!

35:00.861 --> 35:01.860
Hold this.

35:02.736 --> 35:04.735
The old processing plant.

35:05.278 --> 35:06.694
<i>It's been closed for 20 years.</i>

35:07.487 --> 35:09.444
My father used to work here.

35:09.611 --> 35:11.568
Finally, some good out of it.

35:24.861 --> 35:28.486
The plan: We go inside quietly
and carefully.

35:28.653 --> 35:30.819
If we meet our people,
we take them with us.

35:30.945 --> 35:33.860
If we find the aliens, we observe
them, but from a distance.

35:34.195 --> 35:36.860
We have to understand what they
want, and then tell everyone.

35:37.028 --> 35:38.777
Just don't play the hero.

35:38.945 --> 35:40.568
Rus, especially you.

35:40.736 --> 35:42.902
- You owe me another five.
- You'll get it back!

36:08.611 --> 36:09.610
Patrol.

36:31.362 --> 36:34.286
Keep going. And you, stay here.
It's dangerous ahead.

36:34.287 --> 36:36.911
- I said I'm coming.
- Sit down! Sit down!

36:42.487 --> 36:45.244
If need be, shoot, and we'll come running.

37:06.569 --> 37:08.111
Seems to be empty.

37:25.404 --> 37:26.652
- Tyoma!
- Why are you yelling?!

37:26.820 --> 37:28.610
Tyoma, come here.

37:35.653 --> 37:36.944
<i>Is that a bomb?</i>

37:42.028 --> 37:43.610
<i>Probably fell through the ceiling.</i>

38:44.820 --> 38:47.610
<i>Yul, damn it!
I understand, love and so on.</i>

38:47.611 --> 38:49.701
<i>But what's going on here is beautiful.</i>

38:49.736 --> 38:52.643
<i>Just unbelievable.
Come back quickly!</i>

39:31.320 --> 39:32.486
- Yulia!
- Up there!

39:53.820 --> 39:55.194
Higher! I know where!

39:55.362 --> 39:58.610
- Where are you going?
- I think it was here!

40:00.820 --> 40:02.027
Left!

40:02.487 --> 40:03.652
Yulia!

40:06.070 --> 40:07.319
Go downstairs!

40:10.445 --> 40:11.902
There he is!

40:12.445 --> 40:14.444
- Zhenya!
- Quiet! Don't yell!

40:23.736 --> 40:25.236
Yulia!

40:31.945 --> 40:33.986
So, let's go down!

40:39.195 --> 40:40.694
What's this?

40:45.653 --> 40:47.277
A kind of armour.

40:52.445 --> 40:53.444
Like ours.

40:56.653 --> 40:58.361
Where's the creature?

41:08.487 --> 41:09.652
Rus...

41:10.736 --> 41:12.403
We're taking it.

41:30.528 --> 41:31.527
Quiet!

41:31.736 --> 41:33.819
- Patrol! Let's get away!
- What about this?

41:33.987 --> 41:36.361
- Leave it! Help us!
- It's heavy.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.152
Drop it, run!

41:38.320 --> 41:39.568
Help us!

41:39.736 --> 41:41.236
Come on, come on!

41:42.445 --> 41:43.444
Faster!

41:46.320 --> 41:50.035
<i>An object has been discovered,
probably of extraterrestrial origin.</i>

41:50.036 --> 41:52.410
<i>Don't touch anything!</i>

41:54.320 --> 41:55.694
Switch on the light!

41:57.695 --> 41:58.944
One two...

42:00.320 --> 42:01.610
Hook it!

42:04.028 --> 42:05.610
Fly, my dear.

42:12.861 --> 42:14.694
Well... What now?

42:16.611 --> 42:19.403
Should we give it to the military?

42:19.569 --> 42:22.069
We'll sort it out tomorrow.

42:22.695 --> 42:24.169
Now, off to bed.

43:41.695 --> 43:42.694
Hey!

44:53.861 --> 44:55.069
Hi!

44:58.362 --> 44:59.361
Okay, Google.

44:59.528 --> 45:01.527
- You want to study medicine, don't you?
- Yes.

45:01.695 --> 45:04.027
Can you skip the class?

45:04.195 --> 45:05.986
I really need you.

45:14.070 --> 45:15.361
Wow!

45:16.695 --> 45:19.277
This is just incredible!

45:19.445 --> 45:21.444
Humanoid type, as I always said.

45:21.611 --> 45:25.487
They found water in our system, and
there's a trillion planets in the galaxy.

45:25.561 --> 45:27.794
The probability of life was 99.9.

45:27.861 --> 45:31.027
Everyone has been excited about
their alien suits, but the...

45:31.820 --> 45:33.610
Can you calm down?

45:33.778 --> 45:35.944
Think about what we can do.

45:36.695 --> 45:38.361
We need a doctor.

45:38.528 --> 45:39.735
Seriously?

45:39.903 --> 45:42.876
And I wouldn't have thought
of it myself? No doctor!

45:42.877 --> 45:46.419
- The military would capture him! Get it?
- Well, so what?

45:47.945 --> 45:50.819
He saved my life, I owe him.

45:54.362 --> 45:55.361
Hold this.

46:02.945 --> 46:06.444
There seems to be
no visible fractures.

46:06.611 --> 46:07.777
He needs blood.

46:07.945 --> 46:09.461
- He's lost a lot.
- Ours?

46:09.528 --> 46:13.902
Well, yes. He's breathing our air
and his anatomy is similar to ours.

46:14.070 --> 46:16.194
His blood might also be similar to ours.

46:16.362 --> 46:19.527
The truth is, there's a
chance it could kill him.

46:19.695 --> 46:22.344
But without a transfusion,
he'll definitely die.

46:25.945 --> 46:28.194
You're calling an ambulance, right?

46:28.362 --> 46:30.694
A friend of Dad is a doctor.

46:30.861 --> 46:32.986
He treated me after they crashed.

46:33.153 --> 46:35.810
Igor Semyonovich?
Hi, this is Yulia.

46:36.237 --> 46:39.486
You said to call you if
the headache came back.

46:40.778 --> 46:42.336
Yes, can I come right now?

46:42.404 --> 46:44.819
And please ask for a transit
permit for the car.

46:44.987 --> 46:45.986
Thank you.

46:48.528 --> 46:51.160
You take a picture of him,
I'll kill you, understand?

46:51.820 --> 46:53.436
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

46:54.478 --> 46:58.610
Haematology. Igor Semyonovich's orders.
This is urgent. A VIP. No registration.

46:58.695 --> 47:00.069
This way!

47:00.237 --> 47:01.069
Attention!

47:02.320 --> 47:03.694
Here it is!

47:05.278 --> 47:06.277
Stop!

47:09.404 --> 47:10.944
And if we're discovered?

47:11.112 --> 47:14.527
Then I'll say, it was your plan and
you forcibly dragged me here.

47:14.695 --> 47:17.144
Will you stay for me? I'll kiss you.

47:18.945 --> 47:22.086
Wait... Isn't it how you
get someone to betray their country?

47:22.153 --> 47:23.860
Absolutely! Come on now!

47:24.028 --> 47:25.403
- On three.
- What?

47:25.569 --> 47:26.568
Three!

47:28.237 --> 47:30.593
- Close the door, turn the light off!
- Yes!

48:02.153 --> 48:04.319
- Finger!
- Which one?

48:04.487 --> 48:05.610
The middle.

48:07.070 --> 48:08.819
One, two, three.

48:11.112 --> 48:13.735
Well, theoretically, it should work.

48:14.028 --> 48:16.902
There you are!
His blood group is A positive.

48:17.070 --> 48:20.211
Well, according to our classification.
But considering it's from the humanoid...

48:20.278 --> 48:21.919
Enough! I'm A+ too!

48:21.987 --> 48:24.735
Lie down. No, sit down, sit down.

48:24.903 --> 48:26.069
So...

48:27.653 --> 48:30.194
So, insert the needle parallel to the vein,

48:30.362 --> 48:32.860
then find the vein, at the
angle of 45 degrees...

48:33.028 --> 48:35.152
- Come on!
- Just a second.

48:35.320 --> 48:37.152
OK. One, two, three!

48:37.320 --> 48:38.902
No, stop!

48:41.112 --> 48:42.735
Are you kidding me?

48:48.528 --> 48:49.735
Oh, come on!

50:51.237 --> 50:52.238
Yulia.

50:52.561 --> 50:55.152
You go. You need to sleep.

50:55.153 --> 50:57.776
Don't worry. I'll stay with him.
Everything will be fine.

50:57.820 --> 51:01.777
But no photos or posts like "I'm
treating an alien". You hear?

51:01.945 --> 51:05.452
- I'll be silent like a tomb!
- A tomb without WiFi and 4G.

52:46.320 --> 52:49.694
No heat emission, no radioactivity,
no thermal reading.

52:51.528 --> 52:53.236
Absolute symmetry.

52:53.903 --> 52:56.860
Some kind of spherical
mount in a vacuum.

52:59.404 --> 53:00.403
A weapon?

53:01.778 --> 53:04.111
- I don't know yet.
- Well then.

53:33.112 --> 53:36.944
Judging by the movement of
water masses and air fronts,

53:37.112 --> 53:39.777
the ship draws water like a magnet.

53:39.945 --> 53:42.518
Enough water for us to decide
to take emergency measures?

53:42.519 --> 53:46.685
In our opinion, they need the water
for the regeneration of the ship.

53:46.820 --> 53:50.568
About 30% of the external
damage caused by the crash

53:50.736 --> 53:51.902
has been repaired.

53:52.070 --> 53:55.852
We've obtained a piece of their technology,
and it shows the same properties,

53:55.853 --> 53:58.019
but its function remains unknown.

53:58.778 --> 54:00.986
- A weapon?
- Or an element of the ship.

54:01.153 --> 54:03.019
People are already gathering
at the checkpoint.

54:03.020 --> 54:07.019
Rumours are spreading on the Net
that we're hiding the scale of water loss.

54:07.153 --> 54:09.436
As if the boat hadn't
already started to rock.

54:09.437 --> 54:12.885
Well, take a decision! Connect
the town hall to the television

54:12.886 --> 54:16.168
- and let them report every hour.
- We've already taken steps.

54:16.169 --> 54:19.767
Water trucks at the checkpoint.
Water distribution inside the perimeter.

54:19.768 --> 54:24.851
And what do you think we should
do about this element of the ship?

54:26.653 --> 54:29.377
- I suggest we return it.
- To whom? Them?!

54:29.445 --> 54:31.486
We don't know their intentions.

54:31.653 --> 54:35.461
Our main task is to minimize the
possibility of open conflict.

54:35.528 --> 54:37.036
Lebedev!

54:37.037 --> 54:40.102
You were recommended as a
good commander for the rearguard,

54:40.103 --> 54:42.477
not as an expert on
extraterrestrial cultures.

54:42.611 --> 54:44.610
- Allow me to go?
- Where?

54:44.611 --> 54:47.794
- To the rear.
- Please, don't take offence, Colonel!

54:47.861 --> 54:50.319
We're not here on a first date!

54:51.569 --> 54:52.860
Well then.

54:54.320 --> 54:57.060
Your suggestion is good, but
we won't give anything back.

54:57.061 --> 55:00.327
They may know all about us, but we
don't know anything about them.

55:00.361 --> 55:02.444
And your element...

55:03.653 --> 55:05.527
is the only thing we have.

55:18.987 --> 55:20.986
What are you sitting here for?

55:21.153 --> 55:23.152
- He's there, well...
- What?

55:23.695 --> 55:24.735
He came to.

55:33.028 --> 55:36.694
Crap, how can we communicate with him?

55:36.861 --> 55:39.986
In theory there exists a
universal sign language.

55:41.861 --> 55:43.277
Fuck!

55:44.528 --> 55:45.944
Don't be afraid.

55:48.320 --> 55:49.486
How cool is that?

55:49.653 --> 55:51.902
This is speech reconstruction!

55:52.070 --> 55:54.877
A few phrases, and he picked up
the structure of the language!

55:54.945 --> 55:58.069
As I thought, a superior race!

55:58.237 --> 55:59.860
I'm Hakon.

56:02.237 --> 56:03.236
Please to meet you.

56:04.987 --> 56:05.986
Not pleased.

56:06.153 --> 56:10.568
This is a complementary expression,
used as a rule on first acquaintance.

56:10.736 --> 56:13.444
I'm Google by the way,
if you're interested.

56:14.278 --> 56:15.277
Is it yours?

56:15.277 --> 56:16.276
- Yes.
- Take it off!

56:16.277 --> 56:20.074
- Too late, conjugation's already done.
- The transfer of genetic material.

56:20.075 --> 56:22.807
- It means you're stuck with it!
- I understood!

56:22.808 --> 56:26.673
- Why are you here? What do you want?
- I think they want to civilize us.

56:26.674 --> 56:29.290
They're bringing new
technologies to help humanity.

56:29.291 --> 56:30.956
Am I right?

56:32.070 --> 56:34.610
No? Then...

56:35.070 --> 56:37.652
All you want is to extinguish
all life, or what?

56:37.820 --> 56:39.027
This is a difficult question.

56:39.195 --> 56:40.860
Don't move!

56:41.028 --> 56:43.777
I need to go back. Find Shilk.

56:48.237 --> 56:49.236
Get dressed!

56:58.569 --> 57:01.111
You think he's already
learned the word for thanks?

57:01.278 --> 57:03.735
Thank you is a form of gratitude.

57:03.903 --> 57:08.777
She is grateful to you... for saving her.

57:10.112 --> 57:12.810
You think you saved the
enemy and you're in trouble.

57:12.877 --> 57:15.227
Will saying thank you
make it OK for you?

57:46.237 --> 57:47.694
Are you ready?

57:48.320 --> 57:50.568
- Then bugger off now!
- What does that mean?

57:50.736 --> 57:52.236
Fuck off! Clear off!

57:52.404 --> 57:55.610
Get the hell out of this garage
and off this planet, understood?

58:07.404 --> 58:08.403
Go!

58:34.320 --> 58:35.986
Why are you looking at me?

58:36.153 --> 58:39.236
He's the superior race.
He'll find his people.

58:39.404 --> 58:41.527
Theoretically, yes. But imagining...

58:41.695 --> 58:44.194
You've already got to be clever.

59:03.653 --> 59:04.860
Excuse me!

59:05.028 --> 59:06.652
I'm talking to you!

59:07.861 --> 59:09.527
Please stop!

59:15.320 --> 59:17.069
Where are you going?

59:17.903 --> 59:19.236
I'm just going.

59:19.404 --> 59:21.693
First, your papers, then you
can go wherever you want.

59:21.761 --> 59:24.885
What's going on with this buffoon?
Let's pick him up.

59:26.028 --> 59:27.027
Arms!

59:30.611 --> 59:31.902
The other one!

59:35.611 --> 59:37.543
Here you go.
I'll pick it up later.

59:37.569 --> 59:38.568
Hide it!

59:41.153 --> 59:42.152
Stop!

59:42.653 --> 59:43.652
Stop!

59:54.195 --> 59:55.194
Crap!

59:55.653 --> 59:58.236
This doesn't make sense.
You can't cut it.

01:00:10.278 --> 01:00:11.610
Fuck me!

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.243
Think about how much dough
you'd get for this thing

01:00:18.244 --> 01:00:19.585
in an online auction.

01:00:23.195 --> 01:00:25.444
Guys, check this out.

01:00:27.278 --> 01:00:29.819
It doesn't weight anything
when you wear it.

01:00:30.736 --> 01:00:32.319
I'm an Avatar, get it?

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.777
It's a kind of exoskeleton.

01:00:37.945 --> 01:00:40.152
And it's the right size for a person.

01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:44.361
Guys!

01:00:45.195 --> 01:00:47.152
Take this shit off me!

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.568
Pull out your hand!

01:00:49.736 --> 01:00:51.027
Stretch your arm!

01:00:51.195 --> 01:00:52.944
Pull!

01:00:55.404 --> 01:00:56.986
Call an ambulance!

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.377
Are they just cuts?
What are you yelling?

01:00:59.445 --> 01:01:02.486
Fuck your aliens! Why are
you still wanting to resist.

01:01:02.653 --> 01:01:06.186
They're a hundred times stronger than you!
You'll soon see, all of you.

01:01:06.187 --> 01:01:07.969
- Fuck off!
- What you talking about?

01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:10.510
- Take your things and scram!
- Don't touch me!

01:01:11.278 --> 01:01:14.527
- Come on, go home!
- Leave me alone!

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.568
- It's enough, Rus!
- What's enough?

01:01:16.736 --> 01:01:18.518
- Chill out!
- Think you're so smart?

01:01:18.519 --> 01:01:21.394
You'll be the first. The first
to die! Do you understand?

01:01:21.528 --> 01:01:23.568
- Go home!
- Chill out!

01:01:24.987 --> 01:01:27.069
What the fuck are we going
to do with it?

01:01:34.445 --> 01:01:35.694
We'll give it up.

01:01:36.569 --> 01:01:37.777
To whom?

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.777
- I'll call on Yulia's father to decide.
- Seriously?!

01:01:41.945 --> 01:01:44.403
- What do you suggest?
- Sell it?

01:01:48.112 --> 01:01:50.236
- Why not?
- I'll call him.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:00.486
Hello, Valentin Yuryevich?
This is Artyom.

01:02:00.653 --> 01:02:02.444
No, she's not with me.

01:02:02.611 --> 01:02:05.944
- I have to show you something.
- Don't be like that with him.

01:02:06.112 --> 01:02:08.361
- Could you come by?
- Why not?

01:02:08.528 --> 01:02:12.152
Then I'll come to you. It's
quite urgent. I'm serious.

01:02:14.404 --> 01:02:15.694
Yes, I understand.

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:19.568
Thank you.

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:24.777
Citizens, water is limited
to 5 litres per person.

01:02:24.945 --> 01:02:27.819
Why so little?
I have children at home!

01:02:28.362 --> 01:02:32.652
Free hotel rooms with all amenities
are available for those who wish.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.361
Go get one yourself!

01:02:34.528 --> 01:02:36.111
People are angry.

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:39.077
At least they're distributing water.

01:02:39.861 --> 01:02:41.819
I repeat!

01:02:41.987 --> 01:02:47.568
Free hotel rooms with all amenities
are available for those who wish.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.152
Greetings, comrade Major.

01:02:54.569 --> 01:02:57.069
Is Colonel Lebedev here?

01:02:57.237 --> 01:02:59.277
- Valentin Yuryevich?
- Hasn't arrived yet.

01:03:01.112 --> 01:03:04.618
What's going on here? Did you
retrieve something out there?

01:03:04.945 --> 01:03:06.403
- Move the car away!
- Why?

01:03:06.569 --> 01:03:09.610
- This is a safety zone. Move the car!
- We'll leave right away, quietly.

01:03:09.778 --> 01:03:12.027
- Move the car away now!
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:03:12.195 --> 01:03:14.152
Why so rough? This is our neighbourhood!

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.527
- Leave it! Stop it!
- I didn't touch him.

01:03:17.695 --> 01:03:19.694
We'll leave right away.

01:03:32.861 --> 01:03:34.027
Don't hit him!

01:03:34.736 --> 01:03:35.986
What are you doing?!

01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:49.069
Tosha! Anton! Get up, buddy!

01:03:49.237 --> 01:03:50.735
Come on, help me!

01:03:50.903 --> 01:03:52.486
Take him away!

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.777
Disperse!

01:03:55.903 --> 01:03:57.694
Citizens! Disperse!

01:03:57.695 --> 01:04:00.186
- Tyom, get in the car!
- I said, take him away!

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.027
Disperse immediately!

01:04:02.195 --> 01:04:04.486
Citizens, vacate these grounds!

01:04:04.653 --> 01:04:05.902
See you in the garage!

01:04:06.611 --> 01:04:11.110
In small groups. Don't panic.
Move in the direction of the subway!

01:04:11.445 --> 01:04:16.944
If you do not comply with
this order, force will be applied.

01:04:16.968 --> 01:04:20.964
<i>Move in the direction of the subway!</i>

01:04:21.987 --> 01:04:23.777
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

01:04:23.945 --> 01:04:25.361
Don't touch them!

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.902
Where are you going,
old man? Go home!

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.819
Stop!

01:04:33.695 --> 01:04:35.403
We're all the same people!

01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:39.160
It's enough! He has orders!
You want to be arrested?

01:04:41.195 --> 01:04:43.735
Are you still alive?
Come on, get up.

01:04:50.404 --> 01:04:51.527
Corridor formation!

01:04:51.695 --> 01:04:55.568
- Don't struggle, it'll just be more painful.
- Close the ranks!

01:05:12.487 --> 01:05:14.319
Hurry!

01:05:14.487 --> 01:05:16.860
Greetings, Valentin Yuryevich!

01:05:19.736 --> 01:05:21.069
Wait a moment.

01:05:21.987 --> 01:05:23.860
Well, what did you want to say?

01:05:24.028 --> 01:05:25.403
Wait!

01:05:35.445 --> 01:05:38.860
I was just missing you.
We're not strangers.

01:05:39.028 --> 01:05:42.352
We could sit down like a family,
talk, have a cup of tea, huh?

01:05:42.353 --> 01:05:46.019
I don't understand. Is it too
early for you to talk or too late?

01:05:46.153 --> 01:05:47.486
Too late!

01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:51.444
Yulia was right, you don't
understand shit!

01:05:52.945 --> 01:05:56.152
You're the king of Moscow,
aren't you? You've got everything.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.917
Soldiers, cars, planes circling
around. You built a pretty fence.

01:05:59.918 --> 01:06:01.494
You even have horses!

01:06:01.528 --> 01:06:03.444
Stay away from Yulia!

01:06:18.653 --> 01:06:19.819
Take him away.

01:06:27.695 --> 01:06:30.111
Stand up straight.
Give me your hand.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:36.618
- Junkie. Picked up on the street.
- God, the circus with horses!

01:06:37.528 --> 01:06:41.551
<i>... a fragment, presumably from the
so-called flying saucer, was retrieved.</i>

01:06:41.653 --> 01:06:44.244
Where do you think you're
going? Don't move.

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:48.860
<i>This mysterious object is now
with the Ministry of Defence,</i>

01:06:49.028 --> 01:06:52.403
<i>where its experts
continue to investigate...</i>

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:56.444
Did you cut the tips off?

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:03.477
Vasya, this asshole doesn't have
fingertips. What should I do with him?

01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:04.851
Register him as unknown.

01:07:04.945 --> 01:07:06.902
Let the military take care of him.

01:07:25.569 --> 01:07:28.935
Good day, comrade Colonel.
A friend of mine is detained here.

01:07:28.936 --> 01:07:32.518
That tall, funny hat, old coat.
Have you seen him?

01:07:32.987 --> 01:07:35.985
I am Lebedeva, Yulia.
Valentin Yuryevich's daughter.

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:40.277
- Do I need to know that?
- Actually, yes.

01:07:40.445 --> 01:07:44.403
In case of declaration of martial law, the
military assumes governmental authority.

01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:49.527
<i>The commander in charge of the perimeter,
Valentin Lebedev, refrained from commenting.</i>

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:51.361
All right.

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:55.403
Yulia Valentinovna.

01:07:56.070 --> 01:07:59.027
Yes, your friend is quite
peculiar, Yulia Valentinovna.

01:08:00.569 --> 01:08:02.951
It's just that he's from St. Petersburg.

01:08:04.487 --> 01:08:05.486
Yulia?

01:08:06.362 --> 01:08:07.412
- Yul!
- Let's go!

01:08:07.436 --> 01:08:08.478
Yul!

01:08:08.778 --> 01:08:10.069
- Yul!
- Wait for me!

01:08:10.237 --> 01:08:11.361
- Yul!
- Stop!

01:08:11.528 --> 01:08:14.527
- What happened to your face?
- It's alright, Princess!

01:08:14.987 --> 01:08:17.102
When it's healed, I'll be
even more beautiful!

01:08:17.103 --> 01:08:19.385
I'll call my father, he'll
get you out of here!

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:22.385
He sent me here.
I don't need help from him!

01:08:22.487 --> 01:08:24.194
Can you hear me?
It's very important.

01:08:24.362 --> 01:08:27.152
- I have to talk to you!
- Just go. We'll figure it out.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.977
I just want to talk!
Let me through!

01:08:28.978 --> 01:08:31.852
Tell your commander,
everything's about to change!

01:08:31.987 --> 01:08:34.444
The whole area will soon be ours!

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.361
That'll be crazy!

01:08:39.778 --> 01:08:43.444
You have to react when they talk to you!
Then there are fewer questions.

01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:46.185
If you don't know what
to say, at least smile!

01:08:46.187 --> 01:08:47.836
It would really help.

01:08:57.194 --> 01:08:58.294
Something like that.

01:09:03.444 --> 01:09:05.269
Come, I'll take you
to the perimeter.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:08.518
Shilk is no longer there. Armed
men took it away. I saw it.

01:09:08.653 --> 01:09:11.310
And without that Shilk, you
can't get on the ship?

01:09:11.312 --> 01:09:12.836
Home is 47 light years away.

01:09:12.837 --> 01:09:15.060
A transition is necessary
to contract time.

01:09:15.062 --> 01:09:17.569
And without Shilk, Saul cannot
withstand the transition.

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:21.035
So you get your Shilk, and
leave immediately, right?

01:09:21.153 --> 01:09:22.734
Do you want to help?

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:27.060
I can help.
There's a difference.

01:09:28.528 --> 01:09:29.734
Take that off!

01:09:30.736 --> 01:09:32.777
You'll melt! Come along.

01:09:32.944 --> 01:09:34.944
<i>I don't know if our
camera can show this,</i>

01:09:35.112 --> 01:09:37.568
<i>but to the naked eye,
a change of colour is apparent.</i>

01:09:37.736 --> 01:09:41.319
<i>Half an hour ago, we noticed that
the object was acquiring a reddish tint.</i>

01:09:41.487 --> 01:09:45.944
<i>So far, we've not received any comment
from the unified information centre,</i>

01:09:46.112 --> 01:09:50.319
<i>however, I doubt that anyone could say
anything definitive about the phenomenon.</i>

01:09:50.903 --> 01:09:53.069
Hey, guys, come over here!

01:09:54.112 --> 01:09:56.486
- Why are you here?
- I am Yulia Lebedeva, the daughter.

01:09:56.653 --> 01:09:58.994
Please tell my father
I need to talk to him.

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:00.828
He doesn't answer his phone.

01:10:05.979 --> 01:10:06.978
Lebedev's daughter...

01:10:06.979 --> 01:10:09.936
First we need a pass. Without
one, we won't get anywhere.

01:10:10.278 --> 01:10:12.527
Then we'll find out
where exactly it is.

01:10:14.028 --> 01:10:16.986
He's in a meeting. He'll call
you as soon as he's free.

01:10:23.528 --> 01:10:26.152
Please, tell him that I'm pregnant.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.568
In which month?

01:10:33.778 --> 01:10:34.777
The third.

01:10:38.569 --> 01:10:40.986
Comrade officers, please
vacate the premises.

01:10:41.153 --> 01:10:42.860
Everyone leaves the room!

01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:49.944
- Who is this?
- One of the possible candidates.

01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:53.986
- What does that mean?
- Paternity is still unclear.

01:10:54.153 --> 01:10:57.236
We have to have DNA
testing, don't we, Hakon?

01:10:57.695 --> 01:10:58.735
Still unclear.

01:10:58.903 --> 01:11:03.277
Still unclear. That's quite clear.
Did you serve in the army, Hakon?

01:11:03.653 --> 01:11:04.777
I didn't serve.

01:11:04.945 --> 01:11:08.361
So from tomorrow, you'll be at
the border guarding the homeland.

01:11:08.528 --> 01:11:09.944
In a submarine.

01:11:10.112 --> 01:11:12.727
And your Che Guevara will be
sent to the reformatory.

01:11:12.728 --> 01:11:14.685
Great! The baby will be an orphan.

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:18.444
- I'll raise him.
- And if that doesn't work out?

01:11:26.987 --> 01:11:28.319
Dad.

01:11:29.903 --> 01:11:31.152
Hey Dad!

01:11:32.528 --> 01:11:34.819
Please, don't be angry. I beg you.

01:11:34.987 --> 01:11:39.486
It upsets me. And in my condition,
I shouldn't get upset, you know.

01:11:40.736 --> 01:11:43.652
I don't understand what's going on.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.361
You're angry.

01:11:45.528 --> 01:11:46.902
There's no need.

01:11:48.987 --> 01:11:50.403
Get out of here!

01:11:51.404 --> 01:11:52.403
I'm getting out.

01:11:52.569 --> 01:11:54.486
Come on, Hakon, go!

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.403
Is he wearing my clothes?!

01:11:58.569 --> 01:12:01.402
You worry about that?
You're not strangers anymore.

01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:05.819
So, why didn't you tell me sooner?

01:12:09.778 --> 01:12:11.986
You really believed that, didn't you?

01:12:28.028 --> 01:12:31.868
So you think it's funny, right?
Is this supposed to be a joke?

01:12:32.362 --> 01:12:35.111
Do you think I have time
to listen to this moron?

01:12:35.278 --> 01:12:37.461
When's the last time you
listened to me so closely?

01:12:37.528 --> 01:12:40.102
Took interest in what's
going on in my life? Tell me.

01:12:57.153 --> 01:12:58.568
Valentin Yuryevich!

01:12:59.153 --> 01:13:02.361
A flying saucer crashed in our
city, you must have noticed!

01:13:02.528 --> 01:13:05.710
But you don't care. You have
your dad here to fix everything!

01:13:05.903 --> 01:13:09.218
And when the aliens have left,
what new excuse will you think of?

01:13:15.195 --> 01:13:16.361
How?

01:13:21.112 --> 01:13:22.111
That wasn't Lebedev!

01:13:22.112 --> 01:13:24.527
That wasn't Lebedev!
Raise the alarm!

01:13:26.778 --> 01:13:30.311
<i>Warning! All personnel must take...</i>

01:13:30.312 --> 01:13:32.811
Why am I surprised? You
never gave a damn about me.

01:13:32.945 --> 01:13:35.660
Even when Mum was dying, you
didn't let me say goodbye.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.535
You said she was getting better.

01:13:37.569 --> 01:13:41.403
I just didn't want it to
happen... before your eyes.

01:13:41.569 --> 01:13:44.194
But you didn't even think of
asking me what I wanted?

01:13:44.261 --> 01:13:47.386
Maybe I wanted to spend the last
months of her life beside her,

01:13:47.387 --> 01:13:49.386
beside the only person
who understood me,

01:13:49.387 --> 01:13:51.403
and not at the summer camp disco.

01:13:51.404 --> 01:13:53.319
I'll never forgive you!

01:13:59.237 --> 01:14:02.777
First unit, block this road!
Don't retract the posts!

01:14:02.778 --> 01:14:04.884
- Deploy the spike strip!
- Yes, sir!

01:14:04.885 --> 01:14:07.668
Second unit, block the
main entrance! Quickly!

01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:09.502
No one must leave!

01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:17.319
- Andrei!
- Yes?

01:14:17.487 --> 01:14:19.152
- Yulia, home!
- Yes!

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.868
- And this one here, to Kamchatka!
- Yes, Colonel!

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.027
Get in!

01:14:25.528 --> 01:14:27.527
- Serving the galaxy!
- That too.

01:14:29.945 --> 01:14:32.777
Retract the posts! Let the car out!

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.735
- Did Yulia call?
- No.

01:14:54.903 --> 01:14:55.986
Hi there!

01:14:56.153 --> 01:14:57.694
- How are you?
- OK

01:14:57.861 --> 01:15:00.652
- And you, superman?
- Everything's fine.

01:15:02.445 --> 01:15:06.035
- So, how do we get rid of the armour?
- Forget it, we keep it.

01:15:07.445 --> 01:15:09.277
Then what do we do, Tyoma?

01:15:10.195 --> 01:15:11.727
Defend the homeland!

01:15:11.728 --> 01:15:13.185
That's right!

01:15:37.987 --> 01:15:41.227
- We should have added aluminium shavings.
- Nah, it's enough as it is.

01:15:41.228 --> 01:15:42.977
Petrol and oil. Classic!

01:15:43.736 --> 01:15:45.444
Che Guevara did it like that.

01:16:03.195 --> 01:16:05.667
Hello, Tyoma, how are you?
Did they let you go?

01:16:05.668 --> 01:16:07.709
Of course! General amnesty!

01:16:09.153 --> 01:16:13.152
Listen, Yulia. I'm sorry for before...
At the police station, I wasn't myself.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:15.361
You wanted to talk to me.

01:16:15.528 --> 01:16:18.468
- Yes, but I can't right now...
- Want me to pick you up?

01:16:18.469 --> 01:16:20.259
We've started a movement, here.

01:16:20.569 --> 01:16:23.369
- You'll like it.
- Tyoma, I can't right now.

01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:25.444
Ah, I understand. Dad.

01:16:25.778 --> 01:16:26.777
It's OK

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.819
Well, if you want to see me, come over.

01:16:29.987 --> 01:16:31.111
Yulia...

01:16:32.445 --> 01:16:33.568
I love you.

01:16:36.278 --> 01:16:37.403
Bye, Tyoma.

01:16:50.528 --> 01:16:53.518
I need the Shilk to get back on
the ship as soon as possible.

01:16:53.519 --> 01:16:56.852
Slow down! We're not going
in the restricted area now.

01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:59.652
Tell the guard the name of your father.

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.986
Are you serious?

01:17:01.153 --> 01:17:04.159
Just a week in Moscow and your
plans already involve corruption?

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.451
Until night comes,
we don't stand a chance!

01:17:06.487 --> 01:17:08.277
What do we do until then?

01:17:12.569 --> 01:17:14.403
You're as thin as a bean!

01:17:14.569 --> 01:17:16.194
Do you need something to eat?

01:17:16.362 --> 01:17:19.527
Or do you feed like...
with photosynthesis?

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:23.027
Come along.

01:17:50.903 --> 01:17:52.868
Here we are, anyway.

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.610
Charl! Hello!

01:18:01.653 --> 01:18:02.860
This is Charl.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.403
This creature is suffering, it's in pain.

01:18:10.569 --> 01:18:12.668
Yes, I know. She's very old.

01:18:12.736 --> 01:18:14.735
Dad says she should
be put to sleep.

01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:16.027
Put to sleep?

01:18:17.404 --> 01:18:18.561
Killed.

01:18:18.785 --> 01:18:20.061
But I can't.

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.860
Charl's a family member.

01:18:22.028 --> 01:18:25.735
We bought her with my
mum. She's dead now.

01:18:25.903 --> 01:18:29.402
You like to think about your mum
so you let the creature suffer?

01:18:29.403 --> 01:18:30.693
No, on the contrary.

01:18:32.569 --> 01:18:34.319
Well, I need her.

01:18:34.487 --> 01:18:35.986
What for?

01:18:36.153 --> 01:18:38.152
You don't have feelings, do you?

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.777
- We see and feel just like you.
- I don't mean that.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.568
Gratitude.

01:18:48.278 --> 01:18:49.777
Loneliness.

01:18:51.112 --> 01:18:52.444
Hatred.

01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:57.111
Love.

01:18:57.987 --> 01:19:00.718
Love and hate are needed
to overcome the fear of death.

01:19:00.719 --> 01:19:04.268
When there's no death, you
don't need love or hate.

01:19:05.153 --> 01:19:07.944
This is crazy. I'll put that
on my status, OK?

01:19:08.112 --> 01:19:11.386
Yulechka, don't you want to
introduce me to this young man?

01:19:13.195 --> 01:19:15.527
Of course. Hak... Khariton,

01:19:15.695 --> 01:19:17.152
this is Lyuba!

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.694
Lyuba, this is Khariton.

01:19:18.861 --> 01:19:20.403
What an ancient name.

01:19:20.569 --> 01:19:23.111
Old enough to be put to sleep?

01:19:23.278 --> 01:19:24.944
- I'm sorry, what?
- Come along.

01:19:26.987 --> 01:19:30.361
Lyuba, he's from St.
Petersburg, you know?

01:19:31.028 --> 01:19:34.319
And once it was the cultural capital!

01:19:34.487 --> 01:19:35.486
Yes.

01:19:47.945 --> 01:19:49.986
What did you do with her?

01:19:50.153 --> 01:19:51.152
This is Shilk!

01:19:51.362 --> 01:19:53.777
When it's near, you can live forever.

01:19:54.362 --> 01:19:56.610
Charl! Charl! Come here.

01:19:59.778 --> 01:20:01.069
Healthy eyes!

01:20:01.237 --> 01:20:02.568
Healthy dog?

01:20:03.953 --> 01:20:05.036
Wait,

01:20:05.404 --> 01:20:07.918
are you... immortal?

01:20:09.362 --> 01:20:13.361
<i>Mikhail Igorevich, please tell
us about the first contact.</i>

01:20:13.987 --> 01:20:15.319
<i>A tragedy.</i>

01:20:15.487 --> 01:20:17.735
<i>A tragedy on a global scale.</i>

01:20:18.945 --> 01:20:23.694
<i>We were hoping to meet
reasonable, intelligent beings,</i>

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:27.694
<i>with whom we could conduct a
dialogue and exchange technologies.</i>

01:20:27.861 --> 01:20:30.277
<i>But we're facing ugly creatures</i>

01:20:30.445 --> 01:20:33.568
<i>that attacked us at the
first opportunity.</i>

01:20:33.736 --> 01:20:35.403
- Don't be tempted.
- What's this?

01:20:35.569 --> 01:20:37.069
A dangerous thing.

01:20:37.237 --> 01:20:40.735
30 minutes of watching will
make an alien like you melt.

01:21:08.861 --> 01:21:10.236
It's delicious, thanks!

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.027
You're welcome.

01:21:17.445 --> 01:21:19.027
MUSTARD

01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:09.777
What for?

01:22:09.945 --> 01:22:11.486
A joke.

01:22:21.278 --> 01:22:23.860
But that isn't funny.

01:22:25.778 --> 01:22:26.820
Eat, eat.

01:22:26.844 --> 01:22:28.542
What made you jump?

01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:32.986
Have you already met Dad?

01:22:33.153 --> 01:22:35.236
- Yes.
- How was it?

01:22:36.237 --> 01:22:37.319
He scared.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.610
For his daughter, his home.
And I understand him well.

01:22:46.153 --> 01:22:49.194
Don't worry, Lyuba, I'm
not going to marry him.

01:22:50.611 --> 01:22:53.444
So your blessings would be wasted.

01:22:54.112 --> 01:22:55.277
Well, too bad.

01:22:58.153 --> 01:23:01.277
Here comes Dad with his military convoy.

01:23:05.487 --> 01:23:06.486
Yulia!

01:23:08.528 --> 01:23:10.236
- Where is she?
- In her room.

01:23:10.404 --> 01:23:12.735
She's with a boy in there,
and I don't think that...

01:23:12.903 --> 01:23:14.444
Out of the way!

01:23:28.161 --> 01:23:30.286
It was so much better without you!

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.069
Why are you doing this?

01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:41.069
What?

01:23:41.237 --> 01:23:42.803
Inhale. It hurts.

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:45.025
And you give a fuck?

01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:48.819
We have a tradition. Every time
some superior race comes along

01:23:48.987 --> 01:23:51.403
to destroy humanity,
we all start to smoke,

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:53.277
so we can croak faster.

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:56.902
We don't want to destroy you,
you're hurting yourselves.

01:23:58.278 --> 01:24:00.819
I urgently need an
interpreter from space.

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:04.027
<i>- Do you like it here?
- No, I don't like it.</i>

01:24:04.195 --> 01:24:06.361
<i>- And where do you like it?
- There, where the hill is.</i>

01:24:06.528 --> 01:24:08.236
<i>But I can't go there now.</i>

01:24:08.404 --> 01:24:11.610
<i>- Why, do you think?
- There's this thing.</i>

01:24:13.153 --> 01:24:15.236
<i>- Is it hard? I'll help you.
- Of course!</i>

01:24:15.653 --> 01:24:18.652
<i>You can't carry five litres.
That's why I take less.</i>

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.986
<i>But the soup is hardly
cooked, I must go again.</i>

01:24:21.153 --> 01:24:22.819
<i>How, not too hard?
Of course, it's hard.</i>

01:24:22.987 --> 01:24:25.610
<i>That's so cool! Before,
no one was interested.</i>

01:24:25.778 --> 01:24:28.694
<i>Now, everyone's talking about us.
There are reporters everywhere!</i>

01:24:28.861 --> 01:24:30.111
<i>Throw the ball! Thanks.</i>

01:24:30.278 --> 01:24:35.152
<i>- Do you want it to be the same forever?
- Well, it won't always be. Probably...</i>

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:38.735
<i>Because it's martial law. And this
isn't a request! You have to comply!</i>

01:24:38.903 --> 01:24:41.860
<i>Why are you standing here with
a rifle? Who are you guarding?</i>

01:24:42.028 --> 01:24:44.735
<i>- Difficult to answer?
- Should I take your phone away?</i>

01:24:44.903 --> 01:24:46.652
<i>We take pity on those who guard them.</i>

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:49.735
<i>Give them money so they can be
comfortable here in the district!</i>

01:24:49.903 --> 01:24:51.194
Hi.

01:24:52.112 --> 01:24:54.361
Don't worry, we won't stay long.

01:24:54.528 --> 01:24:56.776
We need to change clothes.

01:24:56.777 --> 01:24:58.097
Don't worry.

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:02.652
<i>They will kill you all, one by one.
Mark my words! You all!</i>

01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:04.486
<i>I'm not a politician.</i>

01:25:04.653 --> 01:25:07.777
<i>So I'll keep it simple.
I don't like what's going on.</i>

01:25:07.945 --> 01:25:09.027
<i>No one likes it.</i>

01:25:09.195 --> 01:25:12.361
<i>But we're not doing anything.
And what options do we have?</i>

01:25:12.528 --> 01:25:15.527
<i>We can run away or bear it all.</i>

01:25:15.695 --> 01:25:19.944
<i>Or we can stand up and say,
This is our Earth!</i>

01:25:20.445 --> 01:25:22.111
<i>This is our Earth!</i>

01:25:22.278 --> 01:25:23.819
<i>That's all I have to say.</i>

01:25:24.237 --> 01:25:25.944
<i>THIS IS OUR EARTH!</i>

01:25:28.112 --> 01:25:30.694
Listen, this is not all like that. No.

01:25:43.112 --> 01:25:46.685
- Where are your clothes?
- They're in there, in the closet.

01:25:52.861 --> 01:25:54.277
Take it off!

01:25:58.487 --> 01:25:59.944
Turn around.

01:26:05.404 --> 01:26:08.236
Me too? Turn around?

01:26:08.404 --> 01:26:09.777
- Away from me?
- Yeah.

01:26:11.112 --> 01:26:12.444
Try it.

01:26:17.695 --> 01:26:21.227
This is actually Dad's. Listen,
he'll be here in half an hour.

01:26:21.228 --> 01:26:24.185
Maybe you can hang
around in the subway?

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.277
It's really crowded.
I mean, it would be safer.

01:26:27.445 --> 01:26:30.927
- Don't think I'm kicking you out.
- I have a better idea!

01:26:32.807 --> 01:26:36.803
Why does it hurt so much?

01:26:43.695 --> 01:26:44.902
How do you like it?

01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:47.652
Unusual, interesting, electric pulsation.

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:49.027
Clearly!

01:26:49.195 --> 01:26:51.527
No one will look for us here.

01:26:51.695 --> 01:26:55.194
A concert during martial law.
How unlikely is that?

01:26:56.112 --> 01:26:58.760
- Let's rip it up?
- We'll rip ourselves apart?

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:24.843
What are you standing
there for? Undress!

01:27:28.404 --> 01:27:30.277
Hi, Tyoma!

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:33.069
Listen, last time,

01:27:33.237 --> 01:27:34.860
I was confused.

01:27:35.028 --> 01:27:36.610
You understand.

01:27:37.487 --> 01:27:40.194
No wait! I have some info!

01:27:44.362 --> 01:27:47.610
You're doing fine!
Almost like a human!

01:27:47.778 --> 01:27:51.111
I am human. We're different
branches of the same tree!

01:27:51.278 --> 01:27:53.819
- I can't hear you!
- Give me your hand, you will.

01:27:55.195 --> 01:27:56.444
My hand?

01:28:00.278 --> 01:28:04.361
Shut up! Guess who I just saw!

01:28:50.736 --> 01:28:51.860
Where are we?

01:28:53.404 --> 01:28:55.319
This is my home.

01:28:55.820 --> 01:29:00.135
It's almost like yours, only here
death hasn't occurred for a long time.

01:29:00.653 --> 01:29:04.277
Do you often take girls home
on the very first date?

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.694
You are the first.

01:29:07.528 --> 01:29:09.986
We're not allowed to make contact.

01:29:10.153 --> 01:29:11.944
Crashing at Chertanovo was not contact?

01:29:12.112 --> 01:29:14.027
We didn't want you to notice us.

01:29:14.195 --> 01:29:17.777
The ship hit a meteor shower,
and the cloaking device failed.

01:29:17.945 --> 01:29:20.568
- And then we knocked you down.
- Yes.

01:29:22.112 --> 01:29:26.152
If someone tries to get on
the ship, Saul will destroy it.

01:29:26.736 --> 01:29:30.403
We can't allow our technology
to fall into your hands.

01:29:30.569 --> 01:29:33.403
And you're all ready to die for this?

01:29:33.569 --> 01:29:34.768
It's...

01:29:35.702 --> 01:29:38.000
It's the protocol.

01:29:45.695 --> 01:29:48.568
So we return with your shilk.

01:29:48.736 --> 01:29:50.027
Then what?

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.194
Then we fly away.

01:29:56.445 --> 01:29:57.694
Forever?

01:30:03.404 --> 01:30:04.652
People!

01:30:05.736 --> 01:30:08.986
It's the curfew. We need to end.

01:30:09.153 --> 01:30:13.777
<i>But I want you to know. Many
of you have lost loved ones.</i>

01:30:13.945 --> 01:30:16.527
<i>Many of you crave revenge.</i>

01:30:16.695 --> 01:30:17.860
It's here.

01:30:18.028 --> 01:30:20.527
<i>Stay united!</i>

01:30:20.695 --> 01:30:22.902
<i>It's important, especially today!</i>

01:30:48.736 --> 01:30:51.111
Well, that's it?

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.902
This is harmful. Remember?

01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:02.236
I just wanted to understand.
This, for instance.

01:31:02.404 --> 01:31:04.236
When do you smoke?

01:31:05.028 --> 01:31:06.319
When we're dying.

01:31:12.237 --> 01:31:14.419
Am I not very old?

01:31:37.445 --> 01:31:38.610
Right then.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.319
Go.

01:31:56.569 --> 01:31:59.403
- Yes?
<i>- How are you? Can we meet?</i>

01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.527
Well, I can't.

01:32:09.404 --> 01:32:11.444
It's not true. I don't want to.

01:32:11.611 --> 01:32:14.568
Listen, you're a great guy. I just...

01:32:15.028 --> 01:32:20.944
<i>Yes, yes, I'm great, I know.
But obviously not great enough.</i>

01:32:21.112 --> 01:32:24.568
<i>But, never mind. Don't
worry. Everything's fine.</i>

01:32:27.278 --> 01:32:27.944
<i>Yes?</i>

01:32:27.945 --> 01:32:29.986
<i>Of course. I understand everything.</i>

01:32:30.153 --> 01:32:31.610
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.735
<i>You love him, don't you?</i>

01:32:34.903 --> 01:32:35.986
<i>Yes?</i>

01:32:39.536 --> 01:32:40.535
Yes.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:42.944
<i>Very well.</i>

01:32:58.445 --> 01:33:00.403
- I'll explain everything.
- No!

01:33:01.112 --> 01:33:02.527
Don't, Tyoma!

01:33:02.695 --> 01:33:04.069
- Don't do this, please!
- Rus!

01:33:04.237 --> 01:33:05.236
What?

01:33:05.404 --> 01:33:07.361
She asked you not to do this.

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:13.111
- I'll do it myself.
- No!

01:33:13.278 --> 01:33:15.069
- Let him go!
- Quiet! Quiet!

01:33:15.237 --> 01:33:17.069
- Take your hands off me!
- Don't shout!

01:33:17.945 --> 01:33:19.111
Stand up!

01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:25.194
Tyoma, don't!

01:33:27.404 --> 01:33:29.444
- Be quiet!
- No!

01:33:29.611 --> 01:33:31.735
Please stop!

01:33:37.695 --> 01:33:39.152
Quiet, quiet!

01:33:39.987 --> 01:33:42.194
I always knew you weren't
like everyone else.

01:33:42.362 --> 01:33:43.568
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

01:33:51.028 --> 01:33:51.944
No!

01:33:52.112 --> 01:33:53.568
Quiet. Don't shout.

01:33:55.736 --> 01:33:58.403
I tried to understand what
it is you need, eh?

01:33:59.237 --> 01:34:01.152
What it is I could do for you?

01:34:03.987 --> 01:34:05.652
Please let him go!

01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:07.027
No!

01:34:07.404 --> 01:34:08.694
Will you shut up?!

01:34:09.945 --> 01:34:11.986
And you don't even need anything.

01:34:14.445 --> 01:34:16.652
You just changed me.

01:34:18.695 --> 01:34:19.902
Bitch.

01:34:20.945 --> 01:34:22.111
Tyoma!

01:34:24.487 --> 01:34:26.860
- Look at me!
- He's not human!

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:28.319
Tyoma!

01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:30.069
What's wrong?

01:34:31.569 --> 01:34:33.403
Check this out.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.610
Tyoma, he's not human!

01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:41.777
Give them that thing back
and they'll fly away, please!

01:34:41.945 --> 01:34:43.527
They just want to fly away!

01:34:50.528 --> 01:34:52.403
You don't speak human, do you?

01:34:54.112 --> 01:34:57.777
They're not like we thought.
They're better than us, Tyoma.

01:34:59.445 --> 01:35:00.486
Better?

01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:11.194
Where are you from? Another galaxy?

01:35:11.362 --> 01:35:12.902
From this one.

01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:14.735
The constellation of Gemini.

01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:19.860
And we are from Chertanovo.

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.277
Is he even better than me?

01:36:24.653 --> 01:36:25.819
Rus!

01:36:28.778 --> 01:36:30.694
Breathe! Rus!

01:36:32.695 --> 01:36:34.069
Tyoma, the patrol!

01:36:47.487 --> 01:36:48.486
Help him!

01:36:48.653 --> 01:36:50.152
Help him!

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.760
Shilk can't resurrect the dead.

01:36:55.778 --> 01:36:58.444
Don't move! Hands up
where I can see them!

01:37:09.278 --> 01:37:11.527
Tyoma, what should we do now?

01:37:12.487 --> 01:37:14.403
Gather everyone together!

01:37:14.569 --> 01:37:16.111
Yes. Everyone?

01:37:16.945 --> 01:37:17.986
Everyone!

01:37:20.028 --> 01:37:22.027
These creatures killed Rus.

01:37:24.825 --> 01:37:26.125
Well, that's it.

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:30.076
Yeah.

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:50.154
THEY KILLED A MAN!

01:37:50.178 --> 01:37:52.476
Let's all meet in an hour!

01:38:03.362 --> 01:38:06.444
Look, everybody's going.
Let's go too.

01:38:12.747 --> 01:38:13.946
THEY KILLED A MAN!

01:38:21.112 --> 01:38:23.111
This is our Earth!

01:38:23.611 --> 01:38:25.486
This is our Earth!

01:38:29.611 --> 01:38:31.361
<i>Dear passengers...</i>

01:38:36.153 --> 01:38:37.777
This is our Earth!

01:38:40.798 --> 01:38:42.796
THIS IS OUR EARTH!

01:38:50.736 --> 01:38:53.403
Rus and I went to the
same kindergarten.

01:38:54.237 --> 01:38:56.027
Our whole life together!

01:39:00.736 --> 01:39:03.236
Once we were sent
together to a camp.

01:39:04.987 --> 01:39:07.027
We were 10 years old, and so small.

01:39:07.195 --> 01:39:09.236
There was a mountain
stream, a steep slope.

01:39:09.653 --> 01:39:11.777
Everyone was afraid to jump.

01:39:12.278 --> 01:39:15.152
Well, I decided to
show off for the girls.

01:39:16.362 --> 01:39:18.319
I took off and jumped.

01:39:21.112 --> 01:39:23.277
There was a strong current.

01:39:23.445 --> 01:39:26.819
I was immediately carried away.
My legs cramped from the cold.

01:39:26.987 --> 01:39:29.527
And Rus jumped after me.

01:39:31.653 --> 01:39:35.277
He couldn't swim to save his
life, but he still jumped.

01:39:35.445 --> 01:39:37.027
To save me!

01:39:38.653 --> 01:39:41.403
Fuck knows what was going on in his head.

01:39:42.861 --> 01:39:44.986
He didn't really think
about it at all.

01:39:46.778 --> 01:39:48.610
You knew Rus.

01:39:50.611 --> 01:39:53.236
In the end, I had to get him out.

01:39:53.903 --> 01:39:56.236
We laughed about it for days.

01:39:57.362 --> 01:39:59.194
And today I've lost him.

01:40:05.987 --> 01:40:08.568
Many of you have lost
their loved ones.

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:10.385
My brother's cousin.

01:40:10.837 --> 01:40:12.236
My son's in hospital.

01:40:12.237 --> 01:40:16.028
Slava Porogov, from the 9th
floor, is still missing.

01:40:16.112 --> 01:40:18.777
And what did they do in the end?

01:40:18.945 --> 01:40:20.902
Erect a fence!

01:40:21.903 --> 01:40:24.111
Deploy barbed wire!

01:40:25.153 --> 01:40:27.860
Soldiers with machine guns!

01:40:28.404 --> 01:40:31.860
To protect them, not us!

01:40:32.778 --> 01:40:35.859
- They have their orders.
- The hell with them!

01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:37.735
They have their orders.

01:40:38.445 --> 01:40:39.819
Yeah?

01:40:42.611 --> 01:40:44.894
Can't we re-establish order ourselves?

01:40:44.895 --> 01:40:46.644
Yes we can!

01:40:46.778 --> 01:40:48.527
Or do you prefer to go home?

01:40:48.695 --> 01:40:49.652
No!

01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:52.194
And wait until someone else is killed!

01:40:52.362 --> 01:40:53.069
No!

01:40:53.237 --> 01:40:54.986
Are you satisfied with waiting?

01:40:55.153 --> 01:40:56.652
No!

01:40:59.237 --> 01:41:00.486
And remember.

01:41:01.362 --> 01:41:03.652
We didn't attack anyone.

01:41:04.653 --> 01:41:06.710
We didn't invite anyone either!

01:41:06.778 --> 01:41:08.652
Yes!

01:41:09.278 --> 01:41:11.111
This is our Earth!

01:41:11.278 --> 01:41:12.819
This is our Earth!

01:41:12.826 --> 01:41:16.493
This. Our. Earth!!!

01:41:16.494 --> 01:41:17.951
This is our Earth!

01:41:18.112 --> 01:41:21.277
This is our Earth!

01:41:33.195 --> 01:41:35.860
- Please, wait!
- Out of the way!

01:41:36.028 --> 01:41:38.027
Where are you going?

01:41:38.195 --> 01:41:39.735
This is our Earth!

01:41:39.903 --> 01:41:41.319
I beg you!

01:41:42.112 --> 01:41:45.910
Please! We're human beings!
We don't have the right to kill!

01:41:47.569 --> 01:41:49.236
We're human beings!

01:42:05.195 --> 01:42:07.444
Give me the key to the garage!

01:42:09.903 --> 01:42:12.219
- You take the car, Pyth.
- Where are you going?

01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:13.245
I'll catch up.

01:42:13.246 --> 01:42:14.354
Where are you going?

01:42:14.355 --> 01:42:15.354
Tyoma!

01:42:22.034 --> 01:42:23.034
Time's running out.

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:25.518
I can stop everything,
but you need to let us go.

01:42:25.519 --> 01:42:28.436
- Don't you understand?
- It's pointless.

01:42:28.569 --> 01:42:29.944
They have their orders.

01:42:30.112 --> 01:42:33.135
They were told to
guard us, so they will.

01:42:35.278 --> 01:42:38.444
It's your bad luck. You could
have crashed in Finland.

01:42:38.611 --> 01:42:40.444
Be quiet and sit still!

01:42:41.112 --> 01:42:43.843
Forgive me, it shouldn't
have been like this.

01:42:44.528 --> 01:42:46.361
We shouldn't have come here.

01:42:54.784 --> 01:42:55.825
Do you regret it?

01:42:55.826 --> 01:42:58.527
Was I not clear enough?
Stop talking!

01:42:58.528 --> 01:42:59.819
Let them.

01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:36.424
This is our Earth!
This is our Earth! This is our Earth!

01:43:36.487 --> 01:43:39.527
- Here we come!
- This is our Earth!

01:43:47.028 --> 01:43:49.486
First to Twelfth, First to Twelfth.

01:43:49.653 --> 01:43:51.152
We have people here.

01:43:51.695 --> 01:43:52.735
Many people!

01:43:57.112 --> 01:43:58.444
Citizens!

01:43:58.611 --> 01:44:01.194
Disperse immediately!
This is a restricted area!

01:44:02.653 --> 01:44:04.527
Citizens! Disperse immediately!

01:44:04.695 --> 01:44:05.694
Here we go!

01:44:07.945 --> 01:44:11.486
Disperse immediately!
This is restricted area!

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.777
Disperse!

01:44:25.611 --> 01:44:27.152
Sergei Ivanovich!

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.568
That's OK. Go on.

01:44:32.153 --> 01:44:33.777
Yes? Speak!

01:44:35.945 --> 01:44:37.361
How many?!

01:44:39.028 --> 01:44:40.777
Get me Lebedev.

01:44:42.861 --> 01:44:46.193
What are you looking at, eh?
What are you looking at me for?

01:44:58.528 --> 01:45:02.986
Stop! That's an order!
Stop immediately!

01:45:07.611 --> 01:45:09.735
Do not move!

01:45:16.611 --> 01:45:18.069
Which side are you on?

01:45:18.237 --> 01:45:21.111
Citizens! Immediately
cease any illegal action!

01:45:21.278 --> 01:45:23.236
Your actions are illegal!

01:45:23.404 --> 01:45:24.610
Forward!

01:45:24.778 --> 01:45:28.361
Disperse! Otherwise we'll
have to use force against you.

01:45:46.195 --> 01:45:47.568
Come on!!!

01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:50.277
Close ranks!

01:45:54.112 --> 01:45:55.986
Closer!

01:45:58.195 --> 01:46:03.236
The right flank, closer!
Five steps forward!

01:46:04.778 --> 01:46:08.194
Five more steps forward!

01:46:21.404 --> 01:46:22.902
- Hands off me!
- Colonel!

01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:25.902
The body was handed over to the
expert. They found this.

01:46:26.237 --> 01:46:27.277
Take them off!

01:46:28.945 --> 01:46:30.277
What did you do, Yul?

01:46:30.445 --> 01:46:32.160
Me? What did you do?

01:46:32.228 --> 01:46:35.394
Security log, space
defence, missile defence...

01:46:35.395 --> 01:46:38.310
You're paranoid! You shot them down!

01:46:41.112 --> 01:46:42.361
And who are you?

01:46:42.528 --> 01:46:45.610
If you get closer, Saul
will blow up the ship!

01:46:45.778 --> 01:46:48.610
We'll all die, they and
we, you understand?

01:47:09.945 --> 01:47:12.652
Why do you believe him,
and not me?

01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:14.685
Because at least he talks to me.

01:47:14.686 --> 01:47:17.194
He's not human! We
don't know who they are!

01:47:17.285 --> 01:47:19.201
Am I human? Can you listen to me?

01:47:19.202 --> 01:47:22.710
Instead of bossing me around?
Why don't you try to understand me?

01:47:22.711 --> 01:47:24.844
- I'm trying to!
- Then give us a chance.

01:47:24.845 --> 01:47:27.229
We know what to do.

01:47:27.237 --> 01:47:28.236
Lebedev.

01:47:28.404 --> 01:47:30.652
Valentin, how serious is the situation?

01:47:32.653 --> 01:47:34.069
Good, listen.

01:47:34.237 --> 01:47:37.319
You are on the spot
so act as you think fit.

01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:41.819
I'll take full responsibility!
You have half an hour.

01:47:46.945 --> 01:47:49.927
What happens in half an hour?

01:47:52.653 --> 01:47:55.610
In half an hour, a new day begins.

01:47:55.903 --> 01:47:57.302
I hope so.

01:48:00.653 --> 01:48:02.277
Full assault readiness!

01:48:02.278 --> 01:48:04.608
You crazy?! You're
going to open fire?!

01:48:04.609 --> 01:48:05.608
You fool!

01:48:06.237 --> 01:48:08.652
Do you even understand
what's going on?!

01:48:10.945 --> 01:48:12.152
Yulia.

01:48:13.653 --> 01:48:16.111
Forgive me. I really want to help,

01:48:18.153 --> 01:48:20.527
but I've already lost,

01:48:21.903 --> 01:48:23.236
I'm afraid.

01:48:24.903 --> 01:48:26.908
So, Dad, it's up to me.

01:48:26.909 --> 01:48:27.616
Yulia!

01:48:27.617 --> 01:48:29.075
Get away from me!

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:33.361
We'll all die. A minute sooner or later,
what's the difference?

01:48:34.987 --> 01:48:36.860
Dad. Just trust me, OK?

01:48:37.028 --> 01:48:38.986
Car keys, fast!

01:48:39.153 --> 01:48:41.236
- Go on!
- The keys!

01:48:44.653 --> 01:48:45.944
Follow me!

01:48:59.362 --> 01:49:01.444
- Tactical unit, here, now!
- Yes!

01:49:01.611 --> 01:49:02.610
Run!

01:49:11.909 --> 01:49:12.908
Out of the way!

01:49:32.909 --> 01:49:34.740
They're going to blow it up now?

01:49:34.741 --> 01:49:37.699
No, Saul's waiting.
He'll wait until the end.

01:49:38.237 --> 01:49:40.694
Colonel, may I ask a question?

01:49:40.861 --> 01:49:43.735
- Yes.
- Are we really going to open fire?

01:49:43.903 --> 01:49:45.944
- What was the order?
- Assault readiness.

01:49:46.112 --> 01:49:48.111
- Then get ready!
- Yes!

01:49:48.278 --> 01:49:50.610
- No assault whatsoever.
- Yes!

01:49:52.487 --> 01:49:54.369
Must give her time.

01:50:26.028 --> 01:50:27.152
Die!

01:50:29.903 --> 01:50:31.944
<i>We're following Tiger.</i>

01:50:32.861 --> 01:50:33.986
Shit!

01:52:27.404 --> 01:52:29.361
<i>Avoid collisions!</i>

01:53:36.487 --> 01:53:38.277
<i>Back to the vehicles!</i>

01:53:50.445 --> 01:53:52.568
<i>They attack people!</i>

01:53:53.487 --> 01:53:54.652
<i>We should retaliate!</i>

01:54:09.112 --> 01:54:10.277
I love you.

01:54:13.136 --> 01:54:14.719
<i>They seem to be retreating.</i>

01:54:14.943 --> 01:54:16.941
<i>Nobody moves. Just watch.</i>

01:54:47.903 --> 01:54:49.152
Yulia!

01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:26.069
Stop!

01:55:26.237 --> 01:55:28.052
Lower your weapons!

01:56:11.445 --> 01:56:13.111
What are you doing to her?

01:56:17.653 --> 01:56:20.152
What are you doing to her?!

01:56:27.903 --> 01:56:30.568
Water helps tissue regeneration.

01:56:30.736 --> 01:56:34.403
- Who am I talking to?!
- I am Saul, a small research vessel.

01:56:34.569 --> 01:56:36.568
You can talk to me.

01:56:39.569 --> 01:56:40.694
Will she...

01:56:45.202 --> 01:56:46.409
Will she live?

01:56:46.410 --> 01:56:49.818
Not for long. Seventy or
eighty Earth years.

01:56:54.237 --> 01:56:57.236
- And he?
- Hakon should have lived forever.

01:56:57.404 --> 01:56:59.777
But he passed on his life to her.

01:56:59.945 --> 01:57:02.361
This is not an exact translation.

01:57:03.070 --> 01:57:05.819
- Why did he do this?
- From my point of view,

01:57:05.987 --> 01:57:09.527
this was a chain of random events,
with extremely low probability.

01:57:09.695 --> 01:57:11.652
You call it fate.

01:57:11.987 --> 01:57:13.527
Did he come alone?

01:57:14.528 --> 01:57:17.652
- Where are the others?
- The others don't know he flew here.

01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:21.069
It is prohibited to visit your planet.

01:57:21.861 --> 01:57:24.560
- Why?
- Extremely aggressive social environment.

01:57:24.561 --> 01:57:27.227
Despite close to ideal climatic conditions,

01:57:27.362 --> 01:57:31.027
Four billion violent deaths
in the last 5,000 years.

01:57:31.195 --> 01:57:34.827
Over the same period, about
15,000 major military conflicts.

01:57:34.828 --> 01:57:38.186
The complete depletion of resources
and extinction of mankind

01:57:38.187 --> 01:57:40.061
is no more than 600 years away.

01:57:40.195 --> 01:57:43.186
As I see it, all you plan
to do is live forever, right?

01:57:43.187 --> 01:57:44.978
We want to observe.

01:57:45.569 --> 01:57:49.361
Contact with undeveloped civilizations
only accelerates their destruction.

01:57:49.528 --> 01:57:51.144
Hakon wanted to collect data,

01:57:51.145 --> 01:57:53.518
to prove that you were ready for contact.

01:57:53.653 --> 01:57:56.152
The results of the mission are negative.

01:57:56.778 --> 01:58:00.361
Then there'll be no further attempts?

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.361
There is one factor that
could change the forecast.

01:58:04.528 --> 01:58:05.652
Which one?

01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:07.820
Her.

01:58:07.821 --> 01:58:10.519
Her decision doesn't lend
itself to analysis.

01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:12.853
I don't understand why she saved Hakon.

01:58:12.987 --> 01:58:16.027
And why Hakon decided that
she should live instead of him.

01:58:16.195 --> 01:58:18.060
This is not an exact translation.

01:58:18.061 --> 01:58:20.893
I will have to reconsider the
results of the mission.

01:58:21.028 --> 01:58:24.111
Our common future depends on this.

01:58:24.278 --> 01:58:27.777
I must share with the others
what Hakon found out.

01:58:27.868 --> 01:58:30.660
And that was... what?

01:58:30.661 --> 01:58:33.994
That perhaps there's something
more important than immortality.

01:58:34.195 --> 01:58:36.444
This is an exact translation.

02:00:20.452 --> 02:00:26.535
<i>We are all looking for a dream,
we are leaving home.</i>

02:00:27.618 --> 02:00:29.202
<i>Diving into the depths.</i>

02:00:30.952 --> 02:00:36.327
<i>In a circle of strangers,
again to fall, to take off.</i>

02:00:37.785 --> 02:00:43.244
<i>Strike out letters, wish and forgive.</i>

02:00:45.035 --> 02:00:50.369
<i>To weather our lips, we lose ourselves.</i>

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:57.077
<i>Dismissing comfort, tired of being bored.</i>

02:00:58.827 --> 02:01:04.452
<i>According to the people in the
photo, I'm tired of being alone.</i>

02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:11.702
<i>Don't melt like butter, but I'll hug you.</i>

02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:15.827
<i>I'm back, I'm happy</i>

02:01:17.785 --> 02:01:20.369
<i>Open the windows wide.</i>

02:01:21.119 --> 02:01:23.702
<i>Wake me with the wind.</i>

02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:25.660
<i>Let this city roar.</i>

02:01:28.035 --> 02:01:30.618
<i>Our meetings are so rare.</i>

02:01:31.452 --> 02:01:34.452
<i>Open the windows wide.</i>

02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:38.035
<i>Wake me with the wind.</i>

02:01:38.577 --> 02:01:40.952
<i>Let this city roar.</i>

02:01:41.868 --> 02:01:44.535
<i>Our meetings are so rare.</i>

02:01:45.653 --> 02:01:47.627
They're still talking on TV

02:01:47.695 --> 02:01:50.361
about the heroic victory
over the newcomers.

02:01:50.528 --> 02:01:53.986
And while the scientists are racking
their brains over the water engines,

02:01:54.153 --> 02:01:57.403
people are buying buckwheat,
preparing for the next invasion.

02:01:57.569 --> 02:01:59.819
No one notices the most important thing.

02:01:59.987 --> 02:02:07.694
One stranger, in the far distant cosmos,
believed in us more than we did ourselves.

02:02:10.861 --> 02:02:14.652
Many say that they can't
live as they did before.

02:02:17.653 --> 02:02:18.986
I

02:02:20.528 --> 02:02:22.444
really can't.
