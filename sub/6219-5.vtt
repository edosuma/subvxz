What are you up to?

03:07.520 --> 03:10.148
Just sorting out some photos
and stuff that I
don't need any more.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.901
What brought this on?
Oh, my God!

03:12.984 --> 03:14.277
I mean, is that you?

03:14.361 --> 03:16.446
-Was that haircut
ever fashionable?
-Give me that.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.947
Didn't they have scissors
where you're from or what?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.367
At least I didn't have
imaginary friends.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.994
Just searing wit, you know.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.330
-Cutting sarcasm.
-What do you want, Max?

03:27.332 --> 03:29.292
Did you talk to Dan?

03:29.376 --> 03:31.127
I mean,
have you decided what...

03:32.629 --> 03:33.922
Have you been to the hospital?

03:38.593 --> 03:40.637
I had an abortion last week.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.307
I was going to tell you but...

03:47.393 --> 03:50.438
I don't know, I just decided
to do it on my own.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.941
Are you okay?

03:57.278 --> 03:59.572
Yeah.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.741
I understand.
I mean, it's up to you, right?

04:01.825 --> 04:05.412
I did the right thing, Max.
I mean, look at the mess
that my life's in.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.373
-It was the only decision.
-Of course it was.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.503
But you didn't
have to go through it
on your own.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.964
I know. It was...
It was just easier that way.

-Where is he?
-I don't know,
but this place is weird.

Come on, then.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.891
They're not, actually.

See the way he jumps
every time she claps?

Oh.

And what about me and you?

06:03.154 --> 06:05.824
Or are we pretending
that didn't happen?

06:06.408 --> 06:08.159
No. We're cool.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.204
We are?

06:11.287 --> 06:13.415
You've been avoiding me since
we screwed each
other's brains out

06:13.498 --> 06:16.918
and I wouldn't want things
to be awkward now
we're flatmates.

Fair enough. Neither do I.

-I'm here
whenever you want me.
-What's that supposed to mean?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.597
Look, I'm having a shit time.
I've got no money,

06:29.681 --> 06:32.434
and my parents
have disowned me
'cause they think I'm a slut.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.978
I don't need mind games
with guys like you.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.148
I need friends.
Like, proper friends.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.401
Think you can manage that?

06:41.484 --> 06:43.153
-Yeah.
-Good.

06:47.699 --> 06:51.119
It was a vicar, definitely.
But he was scared, terrified.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.121
But it wasn't in the asylum.
It was in a church.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.498
-Yeah, but there
are no churches here.
-Yes, I know,

06:55.582 --> 06:57.917
but what if the patients
used to go to one near here?

06:58.001 --> 07:00.920
Or maybe one of
them died there.
There's a church nearby.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.797
Wow,
you're not wasting any time.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.215
Well, the quicker we act,
the quicker we
solve the problem

07:04.299 --> 07:06.760

no one gets hurt
this time.

to come here? You nutter.

Can I help you?

08:08.405 --> 08:12.033
Um, yeah. We were just looking
for a venue for our wedding.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.910
-Oh, how lovely.
-Mmm.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.829
Well,
we are a rather popular spot

08:15.912 --> 08:18.498
so you could be looking
at least a year's wait.

08:18.580 --> 08:22.127
Oh, well, that is a shame.
I mean, we really like it,
don't we?

08:22.210 --> 08:26.464
We just have received
a cancellation, though it's
a mere two months away.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.800
That sounds perfect.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.302
I just need to have a word
with my fiancÃ©.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.222
What the hell are you doing?

08:35.306 --> 08:38.434
-I'm just trying
to get him onside.
-Well, this isn't the place.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.022
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.733
Oh! What are we
going to do about...

08:47.402 --> 08:49.654
I'm sorry, Max.
I don't love you anymore.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.157
I'm leaving you for Benji.
The wedding's off.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.541
I mean, I always knew
something was going on
with her and Benji.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.797
The local asylum.
Did the patients
used to come here?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.509
No, no. Never!

09:11.593 --> 09:13.636
But then,
they had their own chapel.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.641
Thank you.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.316
See, I read this
place was haunted,

09:26.399 --> 09:27.859
but I didn't know there
was a chapel in here.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.195
-It's perfect.
-GIRL: For what?

09:30.278 --> 09:34.824
For conducting
the rite of blasphemy!

09:34.908 --> 09:37.369
And you wonder
why people think
you're a bit odd.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.537
-I don't care
what people think.
-Yes, you do.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.957
It's good to see
you again, Chanel.
It's been a while.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.168
All right,
come on then, you nutjob.
Let's get out of here.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.753
No, no.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.089

I'm going to
perform the ritual.

there's something in it.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.354
Right. Just ignore him.
He's a wind-up merchant.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.356
No, I'm not. I'm for real.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.151

satanic stuff. Sticking two
fingers up to your dad.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.988
No, the poor vicar's dead
and he hasn't gone to heaven
because it doesn't exist.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.533
No!

10:16.616 --> 10:19.452
See? See, I told you.
There's definitely
something in here.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.288
All right, that's enough.
The joke is over.

10:22.372 --> 10:25.166
-Oh, come on. Let's just go.
-No, no.
I'm not going anywhere.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.045
All right, I'll stay with you.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.257
What? I'm not going back down
those freaky
corridors on my own.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.260
Hey, hey. Chill. Yeah?

10:35.343 --> 10:38.388
Let's stay here
and do the ritual together.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.183
Come on!

10:42.267 --> 10:46.229
This is going to be fun!

Thought it was about
time we had a chat.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.501
You've hardly said
a word to me all week.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.838
How about we go for a beer?

11:11.921 --> 11:14.090
We're actually
just about to eat.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.844
Oh. Well, maybe another time.

11:22.807 --> 11:26.186
You know what?
Why don't you join us?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.111
MAX: Well, now we know
there's a chapel here,

11:35.195 --> 11:37.238
it can't be that
hard to find, right?

11:37.322 --> 11:39.574
Well, I'm glad we got out
of that one. We could have
ended up married.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.743
Oh, that wouldn't have been
such a bad thing, would it?

11:41.826 --> 11:44.913
-Yeah, it would.
-I think it's
amazing how easy it was.

had that vicar fooled.

married not that long ago.

-You're better
off without him.
-Max...

11:58.134 --> 12:00.178
It's true, yeah?
I've never met the guy

12:00.261 --> 12:02.681
but he refused to stand by you
when you really needed him.

12:02.764 --> 12:06.226
-I mean,
he's not much cop in my book.
-That's a bit unfair.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.646
-Is it?
-Well, he thought I
was losing my mind.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.900
Not everyone's
as open-minded about
the supernatural as you are.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.362
I would never have left you,
no matter what you
were going through.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.990
Ah, you'll make a
lovely husband one day,

12:21.074 --> 12:24.244
and you can have
your big naff wedding
on one condition.

-I can be a bridesmaid.

No.
No, it's um... It's not bad.

Well, this is cozy.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.870
WARREN: Kiera, I'm sorry. If I
sent a text to your father,
it was an accident.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.372
I never meant for
him to find out.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.833
KIERA: Do you realize
the situation I'm in?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.169
I wish I hadn't
been so stupid.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.715
I'd like to help.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.302
-If you'd let me
look after you.
-This isn't the '50s. Jesus!

13:22.385 --> 13:24.346
That's not what I meant.
It's just...

13:25.764 --> 13:27.849
-If you wanted to move in.
-Yeah.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.517
That would really
appease my parents.

13:31.186 --> 13:34.272
Anyway, she's happy here.
Aren't you, Kiera?

13:34.356 --> 13:36.274
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.576
Please come and join us
before I kill someone.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.246
-We'd love to but we...
-Uh-uh-uh...

13:50.330 --> 13:52.165
You're joining us. Now!

13:53.583 --> 13:55.418
Well,
we'll have to look later.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.052
That was Kiera's
first roast dinner.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.929
Well, you'd never have known.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.766
All right, give it a rest.
I know it was foul.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.185
-Don't be so hard on yourself.
-Who asked you?

14:12.268 --> 14:14.646
-Kiera! Come on.
-Maybe things have changed.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.067
Maybe you should accept that.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.862
(WHISPERING) What the fuck?

14:24.406 --> 14:27.367
Uh... So what have
you two been up to?

14:29.452 --> 14:32.330
-Went for a walk, didn't we?
-It must have
been a long walk.

14:32.414 --> 14:35.083
MAX: (LAUGHING)
Yes,
it was a lovely long walk.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.795
It was up a hill. And then we
ran into your
friend Benji, didn't we?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.630

14:40.714 --> 14:42.173
(BOTH GIGGLING)

14:50.181 --> 14:53.059
-I see you haven't told them?
-No, I haven't.

14:53.143 --> 14:56.104
I bet you haven't told people
about your
illegitimate Asian son.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.981
Right. We need to go and
find that chapel, remember?

14:58.064 --> 14:59.774
You're not exactly
in a hurry, either,
are you?

14:59.858 --> 15:01.651
I'm ready to tell the world
when you are.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.070
Well, I'm not. Not yet.

-I thought you wanted this.
-Don't rush me.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.787
This is complicated stuff.
It's going to take a while.

15:14.831 --> 15:18.501
Did you invite me in there
just to embarrass me?

15:20.754 --> 15:24.424
I'll see you in
the office tomorrow.
Have a good day.

15:29.846 --> 15:33.141

the sun sets and
then we can begin.

Do you know what?
You don't really
want to do this, do you?

15:36.394 --> 15:39.397

-And you came, didn't you?

you're doing
a pretty shit job.

-It's nothing.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.593

This place is really haunted.

something here. Don't you
want to help me prove it?

stop talking like that?

what we're looking for.

Great.
What are you trying to prove?

18:31.736 --> 18:36.491
That religion
is a lie, Taylor.
That the Bible is propaganda.

18:36.574 --> 18:40.328
You know what?
If God does exist,
he's a manipulative bastard

18:40.412 --> 18:42.706
that lets human beings drown
in tsunamis,

I'm not the only one
with secrets. Yeah. I mean,
let me get this straight,

23:14.352 --> 23:16.521
you've talked
Warren into thinking
that you're his son?

23:16.604 --> 23:19.107
I mean, this has
got to be about money.
Correct me if I'm wrong...

23:19.190 --> 23:21.151
You have no right listening
to private conversations.

23:21.234 --> 23:25.905
I wasn't listening. I was just
by the door and you've got
quite a loud voice.

23:25.989 --> 23:29.159
I mean, Jesus,
Dan, what are you up to?

23:35.248 --> 23:37.667
It's true.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.085
He is my father.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.837
Of course he's not!
I mean, how could he be?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.714
He just is, all right?

23:42.797 --> 23:45.133
-He had a fling with my mum...

the obvious, yeah,

you're a totally
different color!

23:49.137 --> 23:51.181
Wow!

I know it's hard for you in
your cozy little white world
to understand this,

23:53.808 --> 23:56.603
but it's
possible to have parents
of different races.

23:56.686 --> 24:00.065
My mum was Asian, my father,
as it turns out, is not!

24:00.148 --> 24:03.651
Wait, so you've
always known about this?

24:06.029 --> 24:07.906
My mum died last year.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.827

my dad was my dad.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.504

wanted to find Warren?

know who he was.

I want to take
everything he has.

for what he did.

No, no,
no, it's not in your head.
It's real.

33:24.879 --> 33:26.256
Will you stop talking
like that?

33:26.339 --> 33:28.049
Well,
then what's happening to us?

33:28.133 --> 33:30.260
Why did you
bring us here, Liam?

33:32.679 --> 33:34.681
Look.

33:36.266 --> 33:39.227
What happened to your dad,

33:39.310 --> 33:41.604
it was awful.

33:41.688 --> 33:44.065
But it's been a year
and you need to move on.

33:44.899 --> 33:46.693
Screw you.

33:48.278 --> 33:50.280
Liam, what's that smoke?

34:01.833 --> 34:03.460
CHAPLAIN: Our Father...

34:05.462 --> 34:07.255
Liam, I knew we shouldn't
have come here.

34:07.339 --> 34:09.341
We shouldn't have just walked
into that chapel,
it was wrong.

34:09.424 --> 34:11.467
Who are you?

34:11.551 --> 34:13.553
-Come out. Come on!
-Stop it. Stop it!

34:13.636 --> 34:17.349
No, I'm not scared.
What? Religion's bullshit!

34:17.431 --> 34:20.935
My dad claimed to be
a man of the cloth,
but he beat me so hard

34:21.018 --> 34:24.313
I had bruises on my legs
for three months!

34:24.397 --> 34:27.108
I was seven years
old when he started.
Seven years old!

34:27.192 --> 34:30.110
Liam, your farther said sorry
before he died.

34:30.195 --> 34:31.821
He begged you,
you know he did.

34:31.905 --> 34:33.489
He can go to Hell!

34:37.243 --> 34:38.328

34:39.579 --> 34:41.373
(CHANEL SCREAMING)

34:42.956 --> 34:44.793
Come on!

34:49.589 --> 34:51.882
We've lost him.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.592
(CLANKING)

34:53.677 --> 34:55.512
What's that?

34:56.513 --> 34:58.348
Taylor?

35:10.151 --> 35:12.112
(RATTLING)

35:14.739 --> 35:16.741
CHANEL: What is that?

35:23.289 --> 35:24.290
Oh!

35:25.041 --> 35:27.460
CHANEL: Jesus! Taylor!

35:27.544 --> 35:30.672
-(MOANING)
-Oh, my God! Your mouth.

35:30.755 --> 35:32.966
CHANEL: Who did this to you?

35:33.049 --> 35:34.342
They're here.

35:34.426 --> 35:36.803
-(MOANING)
-Shh. Shh.

35:40.223 --> 35:42.642
CHANEL: Oh, my God.
MAX: Oh,
my God, his mouth's sewn up.

35:42.726 --> 35:45.353
Okay, don't move, yeah?
I'm going to cut you free.

35:45.437 --> 35:47.772
Just nice and gently.
Nice and gently, all right?
Trust me.

35:47.856 --> 35:49.065
Trust me.

35:49.149 --> 35:51.985
-(WHIMPERING)
-Shh, it's okay. It's okay.

35:52.068 --> 35:54.403
CHANEL: Shh.
MAX: Keep still.

35:55.446 --> 35:56.448
Whose idea was this?

36:00.243 --> 36:01.828
-Do you know
what this place is?
-MAX: Easy.

36:01.911 --> 36:03.829
Yeah, of course,
I read all about
it in this blog.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.585
Are you the guy that runs it?

36:09.669 --> 36:11.670
Okay, last one now.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.882
You have no idea what you're
dealing with.
Look at what you've done!

36:13.965 --> 36:16.009
Look at what you've
done to your friend!

36:16.092 --> 36:17.761
I...

36:17.843 --> 36:19.763
(PANTING)

36:51.795 --> 36:53.171
No!

37:05.475 --> 37:07.477
Warren?

38:02.282 --> 38:03.783
Who did this to you?

38:03.867 --> 38:05.660
ELLIE: What did you
do in that chapel?

38:05.744 --> 38:07.245
-Nothing.
-This isn't a game.

38:07.328 --> 38:08.955
Look, you're all in danger,
all right?

38:10.331 --> 38:12.959
It's haunted, isn't it?

38:13.043 --> 38:15.754
That priest...
Come on, let's go.

38:17.714 --> 38:20.342
Well, come on!

38:20.425 --> 38:22.427
No. I'm not going anywhere.

38:22.510 --> 38:23.970
Liam, please.

38:24.054 --> 38:25.722
You started this,
you have to stop it.

38:25.805 --> 38:28.767
I'm not scared.
There is no God.
There is no God!

38:29.851 --> 38:31.686
(SCREAMING)

38:31.770 --> 38:33.605
CHANEL: Liam!

38:37.275 --> 38:39.986
-Max!
-The power of
Christ compels you!

38:40.070 --> 38:41.738
-The power of
Christ compels you!
-LIAM: Please help me!

38:41.821 --> 38:44.032
-What are you doing?
-That's what they
did in The Exorcist.

38:44.115 --> 38:45.533
Don't be stupid!

38:45.617 --> 38:47.535
You have to stop it yourself.

38:47.619 --> 38:50.705
You started the black mass,
the ghost just needs to
know you're wrong.

38:50.789 --> 38:54.000
I... I believe!
I believe in the Lord!
I believe in the Lord!

38:54.084 --> 38:56.961
Why did you do it?
Why did you come here?
Just think.

38:57.045 --> 38:59.714
Think!
He just needs to
know you're sorry.

38:59.798 --> 39:02.217
CHANEL: It was your dad.
It was your dad.

39:02.300 --> 39:04.302
You've got to move on.
Forgive him.

39:06.179 --> 39:09.015
(STAMMERS) Dad, I...

39:09.099 --> 39:13.687
Dad, I know you're sorry
and I just wish you were here
so I could tell you.

39:14.979 --> 39:17.023
I forgive you.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.566
I forgive you.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.033
You okay? It's okay.

39:27.117 --> 39:28.910
You'll be okay.

39:28.993 --> 39:30.370
-ELLIE: Leave.
-Come on.

39:30.453 --> 39:32.247
ELLIE: Get out of here
and don't come back.

39:32.330 --> 39:33.665
CHANEL: Come on, let's go.

39:33.748 --> 39:36.835
TAYLOR: Please, Liam,
let's get out of here.

39:43.967 --> 39:46.428
In the name of
the Father and the Son...

39:49.597 --> 39:51.474
Joseph took a child.

39:51.558 --> 39:54.477
A baby.
That's why
the Chaplain was murdered.

39:54.561 --> 39:56.896
So Joseph sewed up his mouth
to keep him quiet.

39:56.980 --> 40:00.567
Well,
he must have kept the baby
until she was a girl.

40:00.650 --> 40:04.529
That's why I keep seeing Eve.
That's why she's
so scared of him.

40:04.612 --> 40:06.781
But why are you
having visions?
I mean, the ghost is gone.

40:08.408 --> 40:09.909
No, he hasn't.

40:10.869 --> 40:11.870
(GASPING)

40:34.768 --> 40:36.311
(GASPING)

41:38.039 --> 41:39.416
Oh, no!

41:39.499 --> 41:41.084
No. No. No.

41:42.043 --> 41:43.920
No. Oh, Kate.

41:44.921 --> 41:46.798
(SOBBING)

41:48.008 --> 41:50.093
Joseph.

41:50.176 --> 41:52.095
Joseph!

42:00.478 --> 42:03.857
Why did you start
that blog up again?
Honestly.

42:06.609 --> 42:08.486
Um...

42:11.823 --> 42:13.408
I was pissed off
at you and Dan.

42:13.491 --> 42:16.745
-Oh,
Max, I don't belong to you.
-I know.

42:16.828 --> 42:19.664
I just thought maybe we'd...

42:19.748 --> 42:21.916
Things are better
as they are, okay?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.336
Yeah.
Yeah, you're probably right.

42:32.052 --> 42:33.345
Ellie?

42:37.891 --> 42:39.225
Ellie?

42:39.309 --> 42:41.186
(SCREAMING)

42:51.112 --> 42:52.989
(GASPING)

42:54.699 --> 42:56.868
What did you see?

42:56.951 --> 42:59.079
I saw it through her eyes.

43:13.510 --> 43:14.511
(BABY CRYING)

43:20.016 --> 43:21.685
I know who Eve is.

43:23.436 --> 43:24.938
Who?

43:27.232 --> 43:28.900
Me.
