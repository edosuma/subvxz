of threats.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.000
Like, I'm savvy as hell.

17:53.034 --> 17:54.378
I'm good looking.

17:54.413 --> 17:55.964
I'm a physical threat.

18:02.964 --> 18:06.172
Exactly.

18:06.205 --> 18:08.240
SYDNEY:
Wow. Like, what is it about me?

18:08.275 --> 18:10.481
I think they just hate me.

18:10.517 --> 18:11.931
They love to hate me.

18:11.964 --> 18:13.034
They hate me
'cause they ain't me.

18:20.619 --> 18:22.689
[birds singing]

18:25.517 --> 18:26.895
-Oh, no worries.
-[laughs]

18:26.931 --> 18:28.964
Her thing is,
she wants to take out Sydney.

18:31.103 --> 18:33.550
DESHAWN:
Yeah.

18:33.586 --> 18:37.205
She is definitely going
to kill us, uh, come merge.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.240
DESHAWN: I have this master plan
to get rid of Erika,

18:40.275 --> 18:42.344
and she has zero idea

18:42.378 --> 18:45.517
that she's going to be the vote
if we lose the challenge today.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.344
Is it bad if we lose?

18:47.378 --> 18:48.689
-Yes.
-Why?

18:48.723 --> 18:50.034
Just think about it long-term.

18:50.067 --> 18:51.481
We can win, and that's great.

18:51.517 --> 18:53.000
We go into a merge
with Luvu six.

18:53.034 --> 18:54.275
They're picking us off
one by one

18:54.309 --> 18:55.619
'cause that's the easy vote.

18:55.654 --> 18:57.723
We need to take control
of something, bro.

19:01.826 --> 19:03.862
And if we don't make this move
now, we could be screwed,

19:03.895 --> 19:05.931
but...
just throwing it out there.

19:05.964 --> 19:07.344
DANNY:
Deshawn really, really wants

19:07.378 --> 19:10.172
to throw the challenge
and get Erika out,

19:10.205 --> 19:12.136
which makes sense to me, but

19:12.172 --> 19:15.067
as a professional athlete,
this would be a sin.

19:15.103 --> 19:17.448
But I want to compete
and I want to win.

19:17.481 --> 19:19.275
Throwing the challenge--
that goes

19:19.309 --> 19:21.517
against everything
that I've ever worked for.

19:21.550 --> 19:23.792
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19:26.550 --> 19:28.619

19:38.964 --> 19:40.205
Come on in.

19:51.136 --> 19:53.309
All right, shall we get

19:53.344 --> 19:56.517
-Yes.
-First things first.
I got to take back the idols.

19:56.550 --> 19:58.931

-Yes, sir.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.792
-Thanks, Tiffany.
-You're welcome.

20:04.034 --> 20:06.448
Once again,

you're going to race
through the water,

20:12.136 --> 20:14.619
collecting three bags of logs
along the way.

20:14.654 --> 20:17.344
You're going to then push
those logs through a tunnel,

20:17.378 --> 20:19.586
releasing a key
at the other end.

20:19.619 --> 20:23.792
You will use the key to release
three rings and attempt

20:23.826 --> 20:26.275
to land those three rings
on a series of targets.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.619
First two tribes
to finish win immunity,

20:36.792 --> 20:39.034

Luvu, you have two extra people.
Who are you going to sit out?

20:41.103 --> 20:44.826
Erika and Naseer sat out the
last one. They must participate.

20:44.862 --> 20:46.862
-We'll do it.
-Not like pushing...
-Sydney and Heather,

20:46.895 --> 20:48.344

Everybody else,

If she rolls her die

My mindset is,

"Genie, Genie,
Genie, Genie, Genie.

29:32.344 --> 29:33.550

-Okay.

I think you can trust...

29:56.344 --> 30:00.034
Ricard more
than you could trust JD.

30:00.067 --> 30:04.034
Bottom line-- Ricard's been
my number one since day one.

30:04.067 --> 30:07.034
Now Genie wants to vote Ricard,
so now my work is

30:07.067 --> 30:09.654
having her think
that JD is the target

30:09.689 --> 30:11.723
to convince Genie not

'cause we're voting out Genie.

30:13.758 --> 30:15.723

-Okay.
-And I'm-I'm trusting Ricard,
too.

-All right.

He's not stable.

30:24.654 --> 30:25.826
I'm also

30:25.862 --> 30:28.689
deeply concerned that if Genie
doesn't feel comfortable,

30:28.723 --> 30:33.034
Genie could team up with JD
because JD has the extra vote.

30:33.067 --> 30:35.000
Then we could go to a tie,

30:35.034 --> 30:36.931
or a blindside could
potentially be pulled off.

30:36.964 --> 30:38.689
I've got to... I've got
to figure that out.

30:38.723 --> 30:39.895
I've got to address that.

30:42.275 --> 30:45.240

I'm gonna say to him, "JD,

you're working with Genie.

30:46.931 --> 30:48.689

to work with you

30:48.723 --> 30:51.413

your advantage

"and we vote Genie
because I feel like

30:54.103 --> 30:56.481
you're gonna use that
against me with Genie."

30:56.517 --> 30:58.619
What I'm trying
to get is that advantage.

31:01.413 --> 31:04.240
It wouldn't matter if you had
that vote. It wouldn't matter.

31:04.275 --> 31:06.931
I think you're working
a blindside with Genie on me.

31:06.964 --> 31:09.205
Why?

31:09.240 --> 31:11.309
I don't know.
I just get that feeling.

I promise you, that's not
what hap... what's happening.

For someone who plays so well,

31:29.275 --> 31:30.862
You're not voting me tonight
that you're not gonna...

31:30.895 --> 31:32.344
-I'm not.
-So you're not gonna
use your advantage?

31:32.378 --> 31:34.067
-That'd be dumb if I used it.
-So can you leave it here?

31:34.103 --> 31:37.067
I'm not... Like, what if
something pops off at Tribal,

31:37.103 --> 31:39.413
-and I need to use it?
-I'm not... I'm not not...

31:39.448 --> 31:42.481
I'm not... I'm taking you with
me, though, unless you're not

31:42.517 --> 31:43.654
-taking me.
-I am.

31:43.689 --> 31:45.309
So then why... so then...

31:45.344 --> 31:47.448
You should always bring your
advantages to Tribal, though.

31:47.481 --> 31:48.895
I don't want to be that dummy

31:48.931 --> 31:50.862

back at camp.

31:50.895 --> 31:51.654

31:51.689 --> 31:52.792

31:52.826 --> 31:53.826
not become one of the dummies

I might never get
this opportunity again, but JD

35:44.275 --> 35:46.275
You walk in,
and the first thing you say is,

35:46.309 --> 35:48.481
"I'm playing from the bottom."

35:48.516 --> 35:52.137
I mean, the last Tribal, I was
just as blindsided as-as Brad.

35:52.172 --> 35:55.137
So, you know you're on
the bottom of the tribe.

35:55.172 --> 35:57.103
Because you didn't have
the information.

35:57.137 --> 35:58.172
I didn't have the information,

35:58.206 --> 35:59.516
and nobody wanted
to give it to me.

35:59.550 --> 36:02.000
And-and... and I was
really thinking

36:02.034 --> 36:03.172
we were gonna win
that immunity challenge

36:03.206 --> 36:05.447
because we got a lot
of energy from that.

36:05.481 --> 36:07.447
The fish and-and all these
things that we were taught

36:07.481 --> 36:10.413
by the awesome Nathan. You know,
oh, my God, that guy is amazing.

36:10.447 --> 36:12.827
And then this happens,
and now I'm scrambling.

36:12.862 --> 36:14.481
I mean,
people are making me promises,

36:14.516 --> 36:17.275
but how am I supposed
to really believe them?

36:17.309 --> 36:18.516
-You know what I mean? Like...
-It's tough.

36:18.550 --> 36:21.757
-Uh, yeah, it's freaking tough.
-So, Ricard,

36:21.793 --> 36:23.619
with four people,
it's two-two or three-one.

36:23.655 --> 36:25.688
And two-two would mean

36:25.724 --> 36:28.481
that there are two pairs
that are locked in.

36:28.516 --> 36:31.655
-Is that a possibility?
-I think it is a possibility.

36:31.688 --> 36:34.068
I hope that's not the case.
I believe

36:34.103 --> 36:35.688
that's not the case,
but anything is possible.

36:35.724 --> 36:38.481
I don't believe it, Jeff.
It's gonna be three-one on me.

36:38.516 --> 36:41.481
I think they're just trying
to appease me right now

36:41.516 --> 36:43.688
or whatever, so I don't roll
this Shot in the Dark.

36:43.724 --> 36:45.688
It's another new element
to the game

36:45.724 --> 36:48.757
-that can cause a lot of havoc.
-Absolutely. Exactly.

36:48.793 --> 36:51.757
This is the only thing I have
that-that I feel like I can take

36:51.793 --> 36:53.757
-in my own hands.
-I respect that play.

36:53.793 --> 36:57.172
Just keep in mind, when you use
your Shot in the Dark,

36:57.206 --> 36:59.068
you lose your vote,

36:59.103 --> 37:01.000
and that potentially
could be messing up somebody

37:01.034 --> 37:02.827
who is willing
to work with you.

37:02.862 --> 37:06.757
Just make sure
we all do what we said

37:06.793 --> 37:08.965
we were going to do.

37:10.344 --> 37:12.481
PROBST:
Wow.

37:12.516 --> 37:15.931
That is a complicated statement
JD just said.

37:15.965 --> 37:17.413
Does that change how you feel,

37:17.447 --> 37:19.378
or would you reveal it
if it did?

37:19.413 --> 37:22.931
I'll probably make that decision
when I'm in there.

37:22.965 --> 37:25.688
JD, I can feel the tension.

37:25.724 --> 37:27.344
-Yeah.
-Even though
I've seen you at Tribal

37:27.378 --> 37:30.172
-enough, tonight is different.
-JD: Yeah.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.585
I felt like
I had to do scrambling,

37:32.619 --> 37:34.827
and I think Ricard felt like
he had to do some scrambling.

37:34.862 --> 37:36.550
My name's been written down.

37:36.585 --> 37:39.413
-Genie.
-Yeah, my name's been
written down, Genie.

37:39.447 --> 37:42.137
You know, so... just as much
as I don't want to go home,

37:42.172 --> 37:43.724
these three people don't want

37:43.757 --> 37:45.309
-to go home, either.
-Nobody wants to go home.

37:45.344 --> 37:49.516
So, Shan, what's the worst part
of going home?

37:49.550 --> 37:52.034
Not getting to the place
in the game where you wanted to.

37:52.068 --> 37:54.137
You know, as much
as we're all visualizing

37:54.172 --> 37:55.896
sitting in the final three,

37:55.931 --> 37:58.137
grabbing that check
from you, um,

37:58.172 --> 37:59.931
17 people are just not going
to get that.

37:59.965 --> 38:01.655
17 people are going
to be disappointed.

38:01.688 --> 38:04.378
If you get there,
you've killed a lot of dreams,

38:04.413 --> 38:06.137
and if you don't,
then you've killed your own.

38:06.172 --> 38:07.896
JD:
And the worst part of going home

38:07.931 --> 38:11.240
for me would be this idea
that I built up in my head,

38:11.275 --> 38:15.034
growing up, that I was going to
be some amazing Survivorplayer.

38:15.068 --> 38:17.000
And I'll-I'll be honest.
I have not played the game

38:17.034 --> 38:19.000
that I imagined myself playing.

38:19.034 --> 38:20.827
I checked off a lot of boxes,

38:20.862 --> 38:23.034
but the list is so long,

38:23.068 --> 38:25.137
there's so many boxes
that I still want to check.

38:25.172 --> 38:29.137
And, JD, regardless, how long
you last, you don't really

38:29.172 --> 38:31.034
know what this journey
is going to be about

38:31.068 --> 38:32.862
-until you get some perspective.
-Yeah.

38:32.896 --> 38:35.240
I'm just not ready
for the perspective yet.

38:35.275 --> 38:36.688
I'm not ready
to see the perspective.

38:36.724 --> 38:38.862
I need to... I need
to do some more stuff out here.

38:38.896 --> 38:40.413
Then I'll reflect.

38:40.447 --> 38:42.344
In other words, "Probst,
enough with the therapy."

38:42.378 --> 38:45.378
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-PROBST: So, Genie,

38:45.413 --> 38:47.172
we started with you.
Let's end with you.

38:47.206 --> 38:50.344
If it's you tonight,
what will you miss?

38:50.378 --> 38:54.034
I mean, I'm going to miss
everything about this, but...

38:54.068 --> 38:55.827
I have to say, I think
I'm actually gonna...

38:55.862 --> 38:58.034
I'm gonna miss these guys.

38:58.068 --> 39:01.862
Oh, Genie.

39:01.896 --> 39:03.896
Does the emotion surprise you?

39:03.931 --> 39:06.275
GENIE:
I mean, not really.

39:06.309 --> 39:08.206
It's just, you know, you...

39:08.240 --> 39:10.965
We're just... we're just beaten
down to, like, our bare bones

39:11.000 --> 39:12.481
and just the emotions.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.896
It just comes out
at any time, so...

39:14.931 --> 39:17.619
I mean,
a lot of it is exhaustion,

39:17.655 --> 39:21.550
and a lot of it is because
I truly believe we bonded.

39:21.585 --> 39:23.793
This game is hard, and we...

39:23.827 --> 39:25.378
-It's not supposed to be easy.
-Oh.

39:25.413 --> 39:27.172
'Cause nothing good ever is.

39:29.550 --> 39:32.206
PROBST:
And with that,
it is time to vote.
