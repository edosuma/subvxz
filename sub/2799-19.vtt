00:36.995 --> 00:41.205
Focus all your intention on the crystal

00:41.255 --> 00:44.268
for your highest truth.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.732
What is your first question?

00:50.638 --> 00:52.985
I want to know if he loves me.

00:56.422 --> 00:58.517
I see red.

00:58.758 --> 01:01.043
That can be passion.

01:01.174 --> 01:05.053
The connection between
you is very strong.

01:11.068 --> 01:12.982
I see blood.

01:13.023 --> 01:15.599
There's danger around you.

01:15.629 --> 01:17.864
Well, my parents do hate him.

01:17.914 --> 01:20.912
I'm getting a name Ray. Ray.

01:20.932 --> 01:23.247
And a letter "B".

01:23.277 --> 01:25.543
Uh, when, when we put the
name Ray with the letter "B",

01:25.573 --> 01:28.199
does anything come up for you?

01:28.460 --> 01:30.355
We don't know anyone named Ray.

01:30.405 --> 01:32.610
And my boyfriend's name is Stuart.

01:33.743 --> 01:35.658
There's something else
- "R".

01:35.678 --> 01:37.662
Ro-ro... rode,

01:37.703 --> 01:39.246
rode, rodeo.

01:39.276 --> 01:41.401
Is he connected to a rodeo?

01:41.422 --> 01:43.938
Is he taking you to a rodeo?

01:43.988 --> 01:45.872
I don't think so.

01:46.564 --> 01:48.930
I'm getting another image.

01:48.980 --> 01:51.436
Um... an arm.

01:51.476 --> 01:53.030
It's a one-armed cactus,

01:53.060 --> 01:54.904
but it's not in the ground.

01:54.944 --> 01:57.210
And then it's cold.

01:58.513 --> 02:02.142
I don't usually tell
people when I see bad things

02:02.172 --> 02:06.001
but the danger is so
strong I can feel it.

02:06.021 --> 02:06.954
Okay, this is stupid.

02:07.004 --> 02:08.728
You're scaring us.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.491
Don't go.

02:10.542 --> 02:11.876
Come on.

02:11.936 --> 02:13.329
Don't!

02:17.750 --> 02:19.705
Jerk!

02:31.684 --> 02:34.320
Say hello to Anna Leah and Lori.

02:34.370 --> 02:35.543
You may remember them.

02:35.593 --> 02:37.047
A few years ago they stole a car

02:37.117 --> 02:39.102
and found a severed head in the trunk.

02:39.122 --> 02:40.595
How could I forget that?

02:40.635 --> 02:45.036
Well, now they found a dead psychic,
Sedona Wiley, in the occult shop.

02:45.076 --> 02:46.921
She said there was danger all around us

02:46.961 --> 02:48.885
I mean, we almost got
hit by a car right here,

02:48.906 --> 02:50.279
and then she's dead.

02:50.319 --> 02:51.993
Wait, I'm confused.

02:52.033 --> 02:53.898
You left and then you came back?

02:53.908 --> 02:56.574
Yeah. I forgot my sunglasses.

02:56.614 --> 02:57.968
200 bucks.

02:58.008 --> 03:01.616
This officer will take you downtown
to take your statement, okay?

03:09.816 --> 03:11.500
Greg?

03:11.541 --> 03:12.583
Hey.

03:12.633 --> 03:15.059
I thought I paged Warrick on this.

03:15.099 --> 03:16.503
Yeah, about that,

03:16.563 --> 03:18.828
uh, we traded days.

03:19.179 --> 03:20.422
Because?

03:20.482 --> 03:22.277
Well, uh, it's a long story,

03:22.317 --> 03:24.362
but the short answer is

03:24.893 --> 03:27.189
I have an expertise in the occult.

03:27.239 --> 03:28.462
Huh.

03:30.416 --> 03:31.840
Hello, David.

03:31.900 --> 03:32.782
What do you know?

03:32.832 --> 03:34.316
Gunshot to the chest.

03:34.356 --> 03:36.311
Liver temp is 98 degrees

03:36.371 --> 03:38.506
which is odd unless
she's running a fever

03:38.566 --> 03:41.183
It means I can't give
you an accurate TOD.

03:41.213 --> 03:43.197
Sorry.

03:44.982 --> 03:46.896
Bullet was a
through-and-through.

03:46.937 --> 03:50.054
Based on lividity,
the body wasn't moved.

03:50.094 --> 03:51.828
What's in the back room?

03:51.869 --> 03:54.375
A small office.

03:54.415 --> 03:56.540
Probably where she did the readings.

03:56.590 --> 04:00.159
There's, uh, incense,
pendulum, jar of marbles.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.204
They're used for divining.

04:02.264 --> 04:03.938
It's hipper than the old crystal ball.

04:03.978 --> 04:06.324
Where did you say your
expertise comes from?

04:06.364 --> 04:08.519
Oh, my grandmother, Nana Olaf.

04:08.579 --> 04:09.782
She was a psychic.

04:09.842 --> 04:10.995
She didn't have a store.

04:11.035 --> 04:12.599
She just had a kitchen table

04:12.649 --> 04:14.634
and she prognosticated for free.

04:14.674 --> 04:16.468
She had a sixth sense.

04:16.517 --> 04:19.295
And the family thinks that
I might have inherited it.

04:19.365 --> 04:20.889
Okay.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.345
What am I thinking?

04:23.415 --> 04:25.430
That I'm due for a promotion?

04:25.460 --> 04:29.089
I'm thinking you should focus
on your other five senses.

05:11.622 --> 05:13.547
Got some blood drops over here.

05:13.577 --> 05:15.853
Connected to the blood pool?

05:15.873 --> 05:17.968
No.

05:18.549 --> 05:21.165
Maybe the killer cut himself?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.170
I'll swab it.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.633
Gil, you ever been to a psychic?

05:32.683 --> 05:35.400
Would it surprise you if I had?

05:35.450 --> 05:36.633
Yeah.

05:36.683 --> 05:38.237
Surprise.

05:38.277 --> 05:39.650
So go ahead and run it for me.

05:39.690 --> 05:40.923
Sure.

05:40.954 --> 05:43.349
Uh, cash register's empty,

05:43.389 --> 05:46.748
which could mean robbery gone bad.

05:46.758 --> 05:48.893
The shot was a
through-and-through.

05:48.923 --> 05:51.680
Bullet went into this wall.
Haven't extracted it yet.

05:51.730 --> 05:53.900
Shot was fired along this line.

05:59.930 --> 06:03.569
Which puts the shooter on
the far side of the body.

06:04.350 --> 06:07.227
Well, if it was a robbery,
why'd they trash the place?

06:07.278 --> 06:09.052
Well, I can think of two reasons:

06:09.102 --> 06:13.001
one, the shooter was on drugs
and did it just to do it.

06:13.062 --> 06:18.615
Or there wasn't enough money in the
register and he decided to look for more.

06:18.655 --> 06:20.760
Go on.

06:21.753 --> 06:22.615
Well, uh,

06:23.026 --> 06:25.752
he figured that the victim
must have had a purse

06:25.833 --> 06:28.198
or a safe somewhere...

06:29.812 --> 06:33.221
and terrorizing her is one
way to get her to give it up.

06:50.853 --> 06:53.510
They didn't take her purse.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.654
<i>I'm getting a name: Ray. Ray.</i>

07:07.724 --> 07:10.160
<i>And a letter "B."</i>

07:10.210 --> 07:12.546
<i>Um, when, when we put the
name Ray with the letter "B",</i>

07:12.586 --> 07:14.551
<i>does anything come up for you?</i>

07:15.343 --> 07:17.328
<i>We don't know anyone named Ray,</i>

07:17.368 --> 07:19.112
<i>and my boyfriend's name is Stuart.</i>

07:19.172 --> 07:22.139
Ray Bans
- "Ray B."

07:22.180 --> 07:22.931
<i>There's something else.</i>

07:22.971 --> 07:27.142
<i>"R," ro, rode. Rodeo.</i>

07:27.182 --> 07:29.367
<i>Is it connected to a rodeo?</i>

07:29.387 --> 07:31.763
<i>Is he taking you to a rodeo?</i>

07:31.813 --> 07:32.956
<i>I don't think so.</i>

07:33.006 --> 07:35.392
<i>I'm gettin another image,</i>

07:35.442 --> 07:37.858
<i>an arm.</i>

07:37.928 --> 07:41.306
<i>A one-armed cactus, but
it's not in the ground.</i>

07:41.336 --> 07:43.982
<i>And then it...</i>

07:45.025 --> 07:48.503
<i>I usually tell people
when I see bad things,</i>

07:48.574 --> 07:49.967
<i>but the danger...</i>

07:50.037 --> 07:51.601
Grissom?

07:53.486 --> 07:54.628
Take a look out there.

07:54.678 --> 07:56.092
What do you see?

07:56.112 --> 07:57.786
A one-armed cactus.

07:57.826 --> 07:59.731
And take a look at these labels.

07:59.781 --> 08:01.395
"Rhode... eo. "

08:01.435 --> 08:04.061
They spell rodeo.

08:04.101 --> 08:05.886
Power of suggestion, Greg.

08:05.926 --> 08:09.926
I think that the victim saw
images of the crime scene.

08:09.976 --> 08:14.878
Grissom, I think she
foresaw her own death.

08:20.652 --> 08:22.185
Before you ask,

08:22.235 --> 08:25.143
no, I did not find her third eye.

08:25.163 --> 08:27.127
What did you find?

08:27.177 --> 08:29.333
Center-mass shot front to back.

08:29.393 --> 08:31.027
Large caliber bullet.

08:31.087 --> 08:32.551
Clipped her aorta.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.047
COD was exsanguination. She bled out.

08:35.116 --> 08:36.831
David said she was running hot.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.203
There's no signs of infection

08:38.264 --> 08:40.530
but I did find trace amounts

08:40.580 --> 08:43.727
of a white powder in her
nasal cavities and lungs.

08:43.788 --> 08:46.966
Possibly cocaine-induced hyperthermia.

08:47.016 --> 08:50.093
I ordered a full drug panel
and sent a sample to Hodges.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.359
It could be a hallucinogen.

08:52.409 --> 08:54.624
In some native cultures,

08:54.684 --> 08:58.213
shamans use peyote
to call forth visions.

08:58.273 --> 09:02.804
Al, when someone sells love
potions and magic spells,

09:02.854 --> 09:06.333
the only visions they
see are dollar signs.

09:48.177 --> 09:51.773
Five right 44, consistent with a
Smith & Wesson, but no hits in IBIS.

09:51.823 --> 09:54.269
Whew, somebody used some heavy
artillery on that psychic.

09:54.319 --> 09:57.176
And remind me again why you
didn't show up at the crime scene?

09:57.196 --> 10:00.113
'Cause your former lab
boy begged me for it.

10:00.153 --> 10:02.760
He offered to take my
next holiday on-call.

10:02.790 --> 10:05.095
I thought he was nuts, but I
wasn't going to pass him up.

10:05.115 --> 10:05.998
To be honest with you, Grissom,

10:06.018 --> 10:08.333
my wife's having a hard
time with my schedule.

10:08.363 --> 10:10.087
She's spending a lot of time alone.

10:10.108 --> 10:11.942
I didn't think it would
be that big of a deal.

10:11.962 --> 10:13.295
Well, you should have
cleared it with me.

10:13.315 --> 10:15.701
And by the way, you're
still on the case.

10:15.731 --> 10:17.405
All right.

10:17.796 --> 10:18.989
I paged Greg.

10:19.009 --> 10:19.961
I don't know where he is.

10:19.992 --> 10:23.871
That's okay,'cause Warrick
is now backing him up.

10:23.901 --> 10:24.613
What do you got?

10:24.813 --> 10:25.916
There's too many prints

10:25.926 --> 10:27.109
and there's too many hits.

10:27.139 --> 10:28.843
I need some help.

10:28.873 --> 10:31.259
Can you talk to Ecklie, please?

10:31.299 --> 10:32.201
I'll do what I can.

10:32.241 --> 10:33.605
What about the cash register?

10:33.655 --> 10:35.519
I ran those per Greg...

10:35.549 --> 10:36.802
per you.

10:36.832 --> 10:39.098
All the prints belonged to
the victim except for two.

10:39.128 --> 10:41.253
Both of which were a
match to a Reese Bingham.

10:41.313 --> 10:43.990
His work card's in the system.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.884
Okay, I'm on it.

10:45.925 --> 10:47.027
The state has a law that

10:47.067 --> 10:48.431
murder committed during the commission

10:48.481 --> 10:50.355
of a felony buys you the death penalty.

10:50.375 --> 10:51.388
Do you understand that?

10:51.408 --> 10:53.272
This has to be a mistake.

10:53.302 --> 10:54.967
I don't even eat meat.

10:54.997 --> 10:56.049
Or cheese.

10:56.059 --> 10:58.265
I won't even hire an exterminator.

10:58.295 --> 11:00.881
Your prints were found
at the crime scene.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.217
I haven't been to any crime scenes.

11:03.267 --> 11:05.673
You been to any occult shops lately?

11:05.713 --> 11:07.958
Yeah, I work next door to one.

11:07.998 --> 11:11.116
You want to explain to me why your
prints were found on the cash register?

11:11.156 --> 11:13.040
The owner's my friend.

11:13.050 --> 11:14.995
Did something happen to her?

11:15.045 --> 11:17.802
You don't know that she's dead?

11:17.852 --> 11:19.205
No.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.368
She was killed

11:20.408 --> 11:21.431
and then robbed,

11:21.481 --> 11:23.646
and your prints are
on her cash register.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.110
Okay, yeah, wait...

11:25.170 --> 11:26.814
I can explain that.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.227
Start explaining.

11:28.257 --> 11:30.132
I work at a vegetarian restaurant.

11:30.172 --> 11:32.768
We make these soy burgers.

11:32.819 --> 11:34.162
Sedona was hooked on them.

11:34.212 --> 11:36.748
So, you know, she'd order, I'd deliver.

11:36.798 --> 11:40.457
So you're a soy-burger-making,
vegetarian delivery boy, hmm?

11:40.497 --> 11:46.752
Look, she's always busy doing a reading
or whipping up some kind of potion.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.880
She told me to take the
money out of the drawer

11:49.910 --> 11:51.173
Give yourself a tip?

11:51.223 --> 11:53.990
Soy burger and fried was $6.95 plus tax.

11:54.030 --> 11:55.153
I'd take a ten.

11:55.203 --> 11:57.639
You delivered to her last night?

11:57.649 --> 11:58.511
No.

11:58.531 --> 11:59.924
Was it your day off?

11:59.974 --> 12:01.067
Like most nights,

12:01.087 --> 12:02.761
I work until 6:00

12:02.771 --> 12:05.047
and then I like...

12:05.087 --> 12:06.941
to go to the stripperama.

12:06.982 --> 12:09.758
I thought you didn't like meat?

12:09.778 --> 12:12.244
is there anyone who can confirm that?

12:12.294 --> 12:14.089
Well, yeah.

12:14.129 --> 12:15.833
She got a name?

12:15.863 --> 12:18.279
Girls aren't allowed to
tell you their real names,

12:18.319 --> 12:19.823
but I call her Star

12:19.853 --> 12:21.617
'cause she has these...

12:21.657 --> 12:23.682
blue stars tattooed on her hips.

12:23.732 --> 12:27.772
And it kind of looks like a
meteor shower when she dances.

12:27.802 --> 12:29.707
Would you stand up, please.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.196
I can go?

12:32.231 --> 12:33.208
No

12:33.536 --> 12:35.250
You can strip down to your skivvies.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.644
Excuse me?

12:36.674 --> 12:39.170
You want some music?

12:44.503 --> 12:46.277
Hey, Jim.

12:46.317 --> 12:47.731
Packey. What are you doing here?

12:47.761 --> 12:48.693
Aren't you retired?

12:48.733 --> 12:51.199
I'm here on business.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.896
Business? I thought your only
business was playing golf.

12:53.926 --> 12:57.023
Any leads on your dead psychic?

12:57.825 --> 12:59.238
Why? What's the interest?

12:59.269 --> 13:01.173
You looking to make a bet?

13:01.213 --> 13:02.767
I knew the victim.

13:02.797 --> 13:05.203
A few weeks ago I went to see
her about the Wallace case.

13:05.223 --> 13:07.539
So you're still hunting
the white whale, huh?

13:07.589 --> 13:11.939
15 years, no arrests.

13:12.060 --> 13:15.257
Still burns me he used to be one of us.

13:15.267 --> 13:18.856
I really wanted to catch
Wallace before I retired.

13:20.089 --> 13:21.723
So you talked to a psychic.

13:21.743 --> 13:24.189
Jim, she told me things

13:24.209 --> 13:26.615
that she couldn't possibly
know about this case.

13:26.738 --> 13:29.231
She also told me that Claire
Wallace was murdered by her husband

13:29.261 --> 13:32.088
and he buried the body in Summerlin.

13:32.118 --> 13:33.873
Too bad she didn't give you an address.

13:35.617 --> 13:36.509
Forget it.

13:36.539 --> 13:37.732
No, hey, come on, Packey.

13:37.762 --> 13:40.078
Come on, come on. Sit down.

13:40.108 --> 13:41.772
Sit down.

13:42.133 --> 13:43.476
Look, Jim,

13:43.496 --> 13:45.752
I interrogated him at
least a dozen times.

13:45.772 --> 13:46.794
And I never got a rise

13:46.834 --> 13:48.699
from the smug bastard
until the last time-

13:48.729 --> 13:51.074
until I repeated what
this psychic told me.

13:51.115 --> 13:52.959
So you think Wallace killed her

13:52.979 --> 13:54.603
because...

13:54.633 --> 13:57.701
he was afraid she'd
eventually lead me to the body.

13:57.721 --> 14:01.129
I even scheduled another
reading with her, but...

14:01.169 --> 14:03.354
Did he know her?

14:03.394 --> 14:05.109
Did you tell him her name?

14:05.139 --> 14:06.432
Of course not.

14:06.462 --> 14:10.020
Well, if he didn't know who she was...

14:10.051 --> 14:12.065
All right, all right.

14:12.096 --> 14:14.802
At least do me the courtesy of
running Gordon Wallace's prints

14:14.832 --> 14:18.220
against any prints
found at the crime scene.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.443
Check the case file.

14:23.483 --> 14:26.420
The last interrogation
tape's still in there.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.826
You'll see.

14:45.727 --> 14:49.677
Gil, I need a favor.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.849
Most of my girls have tats.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.673
He said they were shaped like stars.

15:04.693 --> 15:05.527
What color?

15:05.562 --> 15:06.517
Blue.

15:07.270 --> 15:08.914
That'd be Tammy.

15:08.934 --> 15:10.648
She's at the bar.

15:10.668 --> 15:11.991
Help yourself.

15:12.031 --> 15:13.284
Thanks.

15:14.126 --> 15:15.349
Greg, what are you doing here?

15:15.379 --> 15:17.254
Oh, Grissom said you're backing me up.

15:17.274 --> 15:19.569
Can't back me up if I'm not here.

15:19.590 --> 15:21.494
The next time you screw
me up with Grissom,

15:21.514 --> 15:23.329
I'm going to back you
up right off a cliff.

15:23.369 --> 15:25.484
Oh, come on, Rick, ain't no thing.

15:25.514 --> 15:26.922
We're working the case.

15:26.957 --> 15:28.982
Flash the badge, no cover charge.

15:29.002 --> 15:30.877
Get to see the ladies.

15:31.108 --> 15:32.230
Let's go.

15:34.937 --> 15:36.952
You must be Tammy.

15:37.794 --> 15:39.648
Yes.

15:39.728 --> 15:42.305
Is there a quiet place
where we could talk?

15:42.625 --> 15:45.553
You got the dime, I got the time.

15:45.583 --> 15:48.841
Unfortunately, the crime lab
doesn't have a budget for that.

15:48.871 --> 15:50.434
Greg Sanders, Warrick Brown.

15:50.465 --> 15:51.768
Las Vegas crime lab.

15:51.798 --> 15:55.056
Well, we get the bottom of
the barrel around this place.

15:55.076 --> 15:57.351
Who's in trouble now?

15:57.391 --> 15:59.416
He is. Have you seen him?

15:59.446 --> 16:01.692
He comes in all the time.

16:01.732 --> 16:05.060
Smells like nasty pickles.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.574
Was he here last night?

16:06.594 --> 16:07.406
Yeah.

16:07.446 --> 16:10.283
Let's see, I go on around 7:00.

16:10.353 --> 16:12.348
He was in the front row waiting.

16:12.383 --> 16:14.272
Hung around all night.

16:14.353 --> 16:16.748
Then he waited in the
parking lot to say good-bye.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.693
So he was stalking you?

16:18.934 --> 16:21.199
No, nothing like that.

16:21.219 --> 16:23.034
He's harmless.

16:23.074 --> 16:25.059
Like you, sweetie.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.265
Hey, Gil, if you're swamped,

17:25.295 --> 17:28.192
I can always cancel my vacation plans.

17:28.212 --> 17:29.485
We've got it covered.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.490
Good,'cause I really
wasn't that serious.

17:31.510 --> 17:32.964
What are you working on?

17:33.144 --> 17:35.079
A favor for Brass.

17:35.119 --> 17:37.926
Oh, the Wallace case.

17:37.956 --> 17:39.840
Yeah, I wanted on this way back when.

17:39.870 --> 17:43.108
But I was the new kid, and my
supervisor wouldn't let me do it.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.103
I probably would have solved it, too.

17:45.123 --> 17:46.228
Is there a new lead?

17:46.263 --> 17:47.334
I'm not sure yet.

17:47.349 --> 17:50.937
I heard Jameson dug 30 holes in
the desert looking for her body?

17:50.967 --> 17:52.411
37 actually.

17:52.431 --> 17:54.215
That's dedication.

17:54.255 --> 17:55.869
Or obsession.

17:56.340 --> 17:59.037
You know, my sister lived near
the Wallaces out in Henderson.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.490
Their fights were legendary.

18:00.521 --> 18:01.804
I was at a barbecue one time,

18:01.834 --> 18:04.490
I heard them screaming at each
other from three blocks away.

18:04.530 --> 18:06.585
Made me and Eddie seem like amateurs.

18:06.605 --> 18:08.821
Where are you and
Lindsay going this year?

18:08.841 --> 18:11.648
Disneyland. With the parents.

18:11.688 --> 18:13.462
Quality time with dad?

18:13.492 --> 18:14.946
Oh, yeah.

18:14.976 --> 18:18.214
And sam wanted to take us on the
Tangiers jet but my mother refused.

18:18.244 --> 18:19.507
Said it wasn't the tradition.

18:19.527 --> 18:21.301
So now we're driving.

18:21.331 --> 18:22.975
Yeah, that'll be a hell of a road trip.

18:23.005 --> 18:25.241
Have fun. Say hi to Sam.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.494
Will do.

18:26.524 --> 18:28.769
Still working on those
prints from the occult shop.

18:28.789 --> 18:31.746
Thank you for talking to
Ecklie. He sent me some help.

18:31.776 --> 18:34.643
Good. I have one more for you.

18:36.277 --> 18:37.310
This is LVPD.

18:37.330 --> 18:40.047
It's not going to be in
the AFIS criminal database.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.781
I'm going to have to
do a manual comparison.

18:41.811 --> 18:44.116
It's going to take longer.

18:44.828 --> 18:46.643
Is he a suspect?

18:46.663 --> 18:49.199
He's a person of interest.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.552
Hey, Henry, what's up?

19:31.592 --> 19:34.168
My job can get a little
mundane sometimes...

19:34.218 --> 19:35.471
not today.

19:35.511 --> 19:38.428
I'll second that and
raise you a stripper.

19:38.499 --> 19:39.230
Okay, sure...

19:39.260 --> 19:42.719
anyway, the powder on your
victim's nose and lungs is atropine.

19:42.759 --> 19:43.882
It's used to dilate pupils,

19:43.912 --> 19:47.440
control bladder problems and
it can be fatal in large doses.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.165
Atropine comes from a plant, right?

19:49.195 --> 19:50.097
Belladonna.

19:50.127 --> 19:51.881
Also known as deadly nightshade.

19:51.901 --> 19:55.139
Most people don't know it grows
wild throughout the southwest.

19:58.036 --> 19:59.901
The psychic had that in her shop.

19:59.941 --> 20:03.509
Can you tell from the blood work whether
she absorbed enough for it to be lethal?

20:03.539 --> 20:04.923
Levels were fairly low.

20:04.963 --> 20:07.198
No other drugs detected. So, no.

20:07.218 --> 20:10.115
But if she hadn't been shot,
it would have made her sick.

20:10.135 --> 20:11.659
What about hyperthermia?

20:11.689 --> 20:12.942
Definitely. Why?

20:12.972 --> 20:14.967
The vic's temperature was elevated.

20:14.987 --> 20:17.644
Belladonna would help explain it.

20:18.977 --> 20:20.150
Later.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.362
Hey, I'm on a break. I'll see you in 20.

20:25.383 --> 20:27.859
Vending machine's on me if
you give me your results first.

20:27.889 --> 20:29.182
No, make it dinner.

20:29.272 --> 20:30.264
Me and you?

20:30.294 --> 20:32.119
Me, you and my friend Julie.

20:32.149 --> 20:34.114
Okay, but I get to sit in the middle.

20:34.144 --> 20:35.317
Deal.

20:35.467 --> 20:39.998
So the isolated blood drops from behind
the register are not a match to your vic.

20:40.018 --> 20:43.677
In fact, they are male.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.273
Really?

20:46.303 --> 20:47.121
Can I have the file?

20:47.156 --> 20:48.161
Later.

20:49.531 --> 20:51.536
So, Mandy says that you have a suspect.

20:51.556 --> 20:53.210
The guy have any cuts?

20:53.481 --> 20:56.328
Warrick didn't find any,
and the suspect had an alibi.

20:56.358 --> 20:58.453
But I think you just broke the case.

20:58.483 --> 20:59.385
How'd I do that?

20:59.405 --> 21:02.182
Well, one of the broken jars at
the store contained belladonna,

21:02.212 --> 21:03.956
which is a poison.

21:03.976 --> 21:05.350
The vic only inhaled it,

21:05.370 --> 21:07.435
but if the killer had an open wound,

21:07.465 --> 21:08.698
he not only inhaled it...

21:08.728 --> 21:10.813
It went directly into his bloodstream.

21:14.572 --> 21:16.366
I need to check the hospitals.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.288
Got to hand it to you, Sanders
- nice call.

21:21.318 --> 21:23.454
They brought the guy in after
he ran his car up onto a median,

21:23.494 --> 21:25.358
right behind the Las Vegas sign.

21:25.388 --> 21:26.852
That's like ten blocks
from the crime scene.

21:26.892 --> 21:28.676
Yeah. Name's Damon Mitchell.

21:28.706 --> 21:30.801
Showed symptoms of narcotics withdrawal.

21:30.822 --> 21:31.814
According to the police report,

21:31.854 --> 21:34.330
he ran his car off the
road up onto the median.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.548
No damage to the car, no injuries.

21:37.578 --> 21:40.114
But he's apparently
hyped up on something.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.560
What do you got, doc?

21:42.781 --> 21:45.597
Well, the lab just confirmed his
blood is positive for atropine.

21:45.617 --> 21:49.246
So I'm starting him on an
iv drip of physostigmine.

21:49.276 --> 21:50.991
You swab that wound on his hand yet?

21:51.021 --> 21:52.143
Right when he came in.

21:52.183 --> 21:53.436
Swab's still around?

21:53.467 --> 21:56.313
Saved it for you. It's
in the biohazard bag.

21:57.526 --> 21:59.150
Mr. Mitchell?

22:00.834 --> 22:02.408
I'm detective Vega.

22:02.438 --> 22:04.985
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

22:07.009 --> 22:09.225
Man.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.801
Your face is melting.

22:13.004 --> 22:14.869
I think I'm going to puke.

22:14.909 --> 22:17.555
Make sure you book
him when he gets sober.

22:19.750 --> 22:23.349
<i>I got a psychic who can
communicate with the dead.</i>

22:23.379 --> 22:26.407
<i>The FBI uses her to locate people.</i>

22:26.437 --> 22:28.221
<i>Your dead wife's been talking to her.</i>

22:28.261 --> 22:31.579
<i>Says her spirit is stuck in Summerlin.</i>

22:31.609 --> 22:36.190
<i>She can't cross over until the
bastard who murdered her is caught.</i>

22:36.230 --> 22:39.428
<i>Psychic says, it's you.</i>

22:39.468 --> 22:41.052
Watch this again.

22:42.917 --> 22:44.761
<i>Your dead wife's been talking to her.</i>

22:44.781 --> 22:48.119
<i>Says her spirit is stuck in Summerlin.</i>

22:48.149 --> 22:51.808
<i>She can't cross over until the
bastard who murdered her is caught.</i>

22:51.838 --> 22:54.344
Yeah, Packey, said he
got a rise out of him.

22:54.385 --> 22:56.630
Right when he mentions Summerlin.

22:56.660 --> 22:58.274
So, old Packey has been punching holes

22:58.304 --> 23:01.311
in the wrong part of the
desert all these years, huh?

23:02.625 --> 23:03.120
Sir?

23:03.155 --> 23:03.616
Yeah?

23:03.617 --> 23:05.612
You said you wanted the print
results as soon as I got them?

23:05.642 --> 23:06.504
Yes.

23:06.534 --> 23:07.917
I tried to run Wallace's ten card,

23:07.948 --> 23:09.952
but the finger rolls were too sloppy.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.828
So I used the latents from the crime
scene against the AFIS civil database,

23:12.829 --> 23:15.055
knowing he'd be in there,
'cause he used to be a cop.

23:15.075 --> 23:16.076
Did you get a hit?

23:16.111 --> 23:17.079
Yeah, I got two.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.726
Uh, Wallace's prints were on
the inside of the door handle.

23:19.756 --> 23:21.330
That places him at the scene.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.984
Well, what do you know?

23:23.014 --> 23:24.377
Were the other ones Greg's?

23:24.398 --> 23:25.711
No. They were another cop.

23:25.731 --> 23:29.540
A... retired detective Patrick Jameson.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.906
Yeah, Packey said he went
there to get a reading.

23:31.936 --> 23:33.860
Yeah. Found a few on the table,

23:33.871 --> 23:37.219
then there were a few more on the broken
jars that were found behind the counter.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.274
Why was he behind the counter?

23:39.304 --> 23:42.963
Come on. Why would Packey
want to kill Sedona?

23:48.075 --> 23:49.749
I need to talk to you.

23:49.769 --> 23:51.283
You heard about the strip club?

23:51.293 --> 23:53.067
I hear about everything, Greg.

23:53.097 --> 23:55.333
Then that ear surgery paid off.

23:55.343 --> 23:56.967
Our first lead didn't pan out,

23:56.987 --> 23:58.581
but I got a better one.

23:58.601 --> 24:00.986
Damon Mitchell crashed his black chevy

24:00.996 --> 24:03.743
into a median only ten
blocks from the occult shop,

24:03.763 --> 24:05.728
right around the time
the psychic was killed.

24:05.748 --> 24:08.615
His prints match latents
we found at the scene.

24:08.645 --> 24:12.274
He was hospitalized for what turned
out to be belladonna poisoning.

24:12.304 --> 24:13.427
And get this-

24:13.457 --> 24:16.985
he worked the national
finals rodeo last year.

24:17.246 --> 24:20.153
Slam dunk. I'm meeting
Vega at PD in 20 minutes.

24:20.183 --> 24:23.712
We have one more lead to follow
up before we call this a slam dunk.

24:23.732 --> 24:25.075
What lead?

24:25.105 --> 24:28.363
I don't think your sixth sense
is working as well as you'd hoped.

24:28.604 --> 24:30.328
Are you accusing me of something?

24:30.358 --> 24:32.062
Oh, come on, Packey,
you know how this works.

24:32.097 --> 24:33.766
I'm just trying to put
the pieces together.

24:33.796 --> 24:36.212
I went to Sedona's
shop for a consultation.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.147
I brought her claire Wallace's sweater,

24:38.167 --> 24:40.091
from the car we found at the airport.

24:40.121 --> 24:41.294
And for your information,

24:41.314 --> 24:44.131
I signed it in and out of
evidence, per chain of custody.

24:44.161 --> 24:44.783
Okay...

24:44.833 --> 24:47.780
I also showed her a couple of photos.

24:47.810 --> 24:50.116
She did her thing;I paid her; I left.

24:50.146 --> 24:52.040
So you were only in
the back of the shop?

24:52.081 --> 24:53.514
You've been there.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.940
You know you have to walk from
the front to get to the back.

24:55.970 --> 24:58.065
Now, come on, Jim. You
want ask me something?

24:58.085 --> 24:59.529
Don't be shy.

24:59.559 --> 25:01.273
Somebody trashed the place,

25:01.303 --> 25:02.736
and we found your prints,

25:02.767 --> 25:04.561
on the pieces of broken glass.

25:04.611 --> 25:05.774
And you think, what, I did it?

25:05.814 --> 25:09.703
No, but I want to know what your
prints are doing on those glass jars.

25:10.074 --> 25:13.603
she had all these weird
powders and fairy dust,

25:13.633 --> 25:16.750
and something called a gris-gris bag.

25:16.981 --> 25:18.966
Said she had her mojo working.

25:18.986 --> 25:21.502
Seemed sketchy. I
figured she was dealing.

25:21.522 --> 25:24.158
Oh... I don't know,
Packey, that's a stretch.

25:24.199 --> 25:26.414
Come on, Jim. You know
these hippy-dippy types.

25:26.444 --> 25:29.141
They love their drugs,
so I questioned her.

25:29.181 --> 25:31.677
Got a lesson in alchemy.

25:31.897 --> 25:35.777
Have you ever seen a wolf's heart?

25:35.807 --> 25:37.772
A dried bat?

25:37.862 --> 25:39.817
Well, I held 'em.

25:40.518 --> 25:42.132
Satisfied?

25:49.941 --> 25:52.187
Can I get some more water?

25:53.279 --> 25:54.893
We're all out.

25:54.933 --> 25:57.530
Mr. Mitchell, are you into psychics?

25:57.560 --> 25:59.605
No. I'm not...

25:59.775 --> 26:01.980
I'm really thirsty.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.306
Doctor said push the fluids.

26:04.346 --> 26:06.531
We know that you went to an occult shop.

26:06.562 --> 26:09.769
Yeah, you left your fingerprints
and your blood at the location.

26:09.809 --> 26:12.135
And according to this tox report,

26:12.155 --> 26:15.172
you were most likely
poisoned at the same place.

26:17.147 --> 26:19.804
Okay. I was there,

26:19.844 --> 26:23.032
but I didn't kill that
little con artist bitch.

26:23.773 --> 26:24.926
Then why lie about it?

26:24.946 --> 26:26.430
'Cause I didn't think you'd believe me.

26:26.450 --> 26:28.665
I'm in enough trouble already.

26:28.705 --> 26:30.369
Give it a shot.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.788
My wife is a junky.

26:33.828 --> 26:35.372
She's a psychic junky.

26:35.392 --> 26:38.299
She spent our entire
savings on consultations,

26:38.339 --> 26:40.945
tarot readings and other garbage.

26:40.965 --> 26:43.060
Thousands of dollars.

26:43.100 --> 26:45.276
I told her she had to
quit seeing this woman.

26:45.326 --> 26:47.401
That was my mistake.

26:48.022 --> 26:52.744
The week after, Sedona starts
having these visions of me cheating.

26:52.784 --> 26:56.302
You ever try to defend yourself
against a psychic's vision?

26:56.322 --> 26:59.039
I bet that pissed you off.
So you got revenge by...

26:59.059 --> 27:04.322
I went down there to confront the
bitch because she ruined my life.

27:04.362 --> 27:06.477
You want to know what she said to me?

27:06.507 --> 27:08.061
You want your wife back?

27:08.081 --> 27:10.286
That's going to cost you $5,000.

27:10.306 --> 27:11.173
What?!

27:11.208 --> 27:12.040
Cash.

27:12.101 --> 27:14.146
I will look into her future

27:14.166 --> 27:18.917
and I'll tell her that she takes you
back, and you live happily ever after.

27:18.937 --> 27:22.877
She tried to extort more money from
me after she had already taken it all.

27:22.907 --> 27:24.270
I lost it.

27:24.341 --> 27:26.576
You think this is funny?

27:35.548 --> 27:36.881
Mr. Mitchell, do you own a gun?

27:36.911 --> 27:40.851
No. Look, when I left
there, she was alive.

27:40.901 --> 27:42.264
What time was that?

27:42.294 --> 27:45.332
It was after 9:00,
around... closer to 9:30.

27:45.362 --> 27:47.036
Then where'd you go?

27:47.096 --> 27:50.985
Uh... I went around the corner to
the liquor store for some bourbon.

27:51.015 --> 27:52.880
But before I even opened it,

27:52.910 --> 27:54.915
I started to feel whoozy.

27:54.965 --> 27:59.636
You know, then... everything
kind of went sideways.

27:59.726 --> 28:02.824
The cops find the gun or the
stolen cash in the vehicle?

28:02.854 --> 28:04.799
No. Only a full bottle of bourbon.

28:04.809 --> 28:06.112
But he could've ditched the gun.

28:06.142 --> 28:08.087
Well, the victim took
him for several grand.

28:08.117 --> 28:10.142
He's not ditching the money.

28:10.513 --> 28:11.916
Tight suit, baby.

28:11.946 --> 28:13.239
Actually, it's not.

28:13.249 --> 28:15.856
Um, I've only gained a couple
of pounds, and I tend to gain...

28:15.876 --> 28:18.121
no, I mean it, looks good on you.

28:18.141 --> 28:19.114
I see. Well...

28:19.134 --> 28:20.447
thank you, Warrick.

28:20.497 --> 28:21.950
So, what's with the ghetto?

28:21.981 --> 28:25.259
I was with Conrad and the mayor
at the city council budget meeting,

28:25.279 --> 28:27.414
requesting more funds for you slackers.

28:27.434 --> 28:30.551
So you probably didn't have
any time to get some work done?

28:30.571 --> 28:31.855
Au contraire.

28:31.895 --> 28:34.080
Multitasking is my forte.

28:34.220 --> 28:36.997
In fact, I shared your
results with the city council.

28:37.027 --> 28:40.135
Fine crime fighting,
courtesy of your trace lab.

28:40.185 --> 28:43.633
The gold flecks that you pulled from
the cash register was iron pyrite,

28:43.668 --> 28:45.438
commonly known as fool's gold.

28:45.468 --> 28:48.054
What was it doing in the cash register?

28:48.144 --> 28:50.129
It's also known as prosperity dust.

28:50.149 --> 28:51.292
It could be for good luck.

28:51.322 --> 28:53.427
Didn't work for Sedona Wiley.

29:00.554 --> 29:02.449
Jim Brass.

29:02.830 --> 29:04.494
Been a long time.

29:04.534 --> 29:05.797
How's it going, Gordon?

29:06.098 --> 29:08.453
This is Gil Grissom from the crime lab.

29:08.564 --> 29:12.894
So, Gordon, where were you the night
before last between 6:30 and 10:00.

29:12.914 --> 29:18.127
Well, I'm working 24-7 for
Joslynn Raines while she's in town,

29:18.147 --> 29:21.225
so I was here with my crew until 10:00.

29:21.355 --> 29:24.372
Raced over to the airport,
picked up my brother.

29:24.402 --> 29:27.039
Flew in from Florida,
landed around 10:30.

29:27.059 --> 29:29.545
Brought him back here for the last show.

29:29.565 --> 29:32.913
You ever been to the
sixth sense occult shop?

29:33.595 --> 29:34.908
What? That's funny?

29:34.938 --> 29:36.131
Nah, it's just, I...

29:36.161 --> 29:39.499
I thought you were busting my
chops for your boy, Jameson.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.855
Yeah, I was there, earlier this week.

29:41.875 --> 29:44.541
Joslynn wanted to buy a love potion.

29:44.571 --> 29:46.165
Despite her killer looks,

29:46.195 --> 29:50.155
the young lady is unlucky
in the romance department.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.210
You don't believe me?

29:52.240 --> 29:53.754
Let's go ask her.

29:54.265 --> 30:00.209
Hey, Joslynn can you spare a
minute for the, uh, boys in blue?

30:00.239 --> 30:01.252
Friends of yours?

30:01.262 --> 30:02.796
Sure. Nice to meet you.

30:02.816 --> 30:04.269
Love your city.

30:04.399 --> 30:06.444
So you got a pen, or...?

30:10.284 --> 30:11.787
Um, miss Raines,

30:11.827 --> 30:14.925
were you at the sixth sense
occult shop earlier this week?

30:14.955 --> 30:16.379
Yeah. Gordie took me.

30:16.419 --> 30:18.724
I got a reading, picked up a few things.

30:18.774 --> 30:24.057
Uh-huh. Did, uh, did Gordie
go inside the shop with you?

30:24.107 --> 30:27.024
He goes where I go.

30:28.909 --> 30:32.207
I offered to pay to clear his
aura, but he wasn't in to it.

30:32.217 --> 30:34.352
It's good for his soul.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.507
Are we done?

30:36.738 --> 30:38.141
You're going to need to...

30:38.161 --> 30:40.397
exit out the front.

30:40.487 --> 30:41.800
Maybe we can get a warrant

30:41.840 --> 30:45.690
and match the glass in Wallace's shoe
to the glass we found at the scene,

30:45.725 --> 30:46.993
and then tie him to the murder.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.908
I don't know how. Glass
breaks all the time.

30:48.928 --> 30:50.371
It's not a unique event.

30:50.421 --> 30:53.599
Plus, he admits to being in the
shop, which accounts for his prints.

30:53.629 --> 30:55.754
You know, maybe Packey was right-

30:55.784 --> 30:57.669
Maybe Wallace did kill that psychic.

30:57.699 --> 31:00.716
Well, he'd only kill her
if he also killed his wife.

31:05.498 --> 31:07.302
This is the map I've
been working off of,

31:07.503 --> 31:11.312
and each of these red stickers represents
a hole I dug based on different information.

31:11.713 --> 31:15.020
Now, most were around the
house he owned in Sunrise Manor.

31:15.021 --> 31:16.524
These were near his, uh,

31:16.525 --> 31:18.128
brother's place,

31:18.129 --> 31:21.262
and a few near his sister's place.

31:21.297 --> 31:21.574
That's where they grew up, in Henderson.

31:22.038 --> 31:23.571
So you never looked in Summerlin?

31:23.943 --> 31:25.143
No reason to.

31:25.346 --> 31:26.047
It says here,

31:26.048 --> 31:27.450
when Wallace was a cop,

31:27.451 --> 31:29.256
he worked the northwest substation,

31:29.857 --> 31:31.460
that includes Summerlin.

31:31.461 --> 31:33.665
Yeah, but he hadn't been
on the job that long,

31:33.666 --> 31:35.570
and Summerlin is out of his comfort zone

31:35.571 --> 31:37.475
and a long way from where they live.

31:37.476 --> 31:38.176
No, he...

31:38.177 --> 31:40.182
he had better options closer to home.

31:40.583 --> 31:42.815
So, where would his parameters be?

31:42.989 --> 31:46.022
Well, he'd pick a place where
people don't normally go.

31:47.099 --> 31:53.581
Wallace worked northwest from
January 1990 to August '92.

31:54.016 --> 31:57.905
He responded to like 20
crime scenes in Summerlin.

31:58.326 --> 32:01.633
If we just limit it down
to the remote location...

32:01.634 --> 32:02.708
Let me look at that.

32:05.243 --> 32:07.748
Summerlin's changed a lot
over the last ten years.

32:07.749 --> 32:09.765
Yeah, but there's two...

32:12.260 --> 32:14.590
three, possibilities.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.458
I got an idea.

32:22.886 --> 32:23.687
Back in the day,

32:23.688 --> 32:29.046
squatters were always camping
their RVs in this area.

32:29.081 --> 32:29.081
That's what brought Wallace up here.

32:29.302 --> 32:32.396
Illegal dumping of human
waste on public lands.

32:39.226 --> 32:39.957
Grissom!

32:41.331 --> 32:42.619
I've got something!

32:44.238 --> 32:45.780
Metallic signature.

32:46.243 --> 32:48.283
This could be the abandoned septic tank.

32:48.348 --> 32:49.973
Time to find out.

33:28.345 --> 33:29.147
Clear!

34:02.428 --> 34:04.665
Mrs. Wallace, I presume.

34:17.665 --> 34:18.730
Hey, Greg.

34:19.870 --> 34:21.186
You missed some.

34:26.585 --> 34:29.871
Well, one more spider bite
won't make a difference.

34:30.897 --> 34:32.600
But you, being the bug guy,

34:32.601 --> 34:34.617
would probably enjoy being bitten.

34:52.750 --> 34:53.775
Could be a rib.

34:55.456 --> 34:56.856
It's too small.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.709
Did the Wallaces have a kid?

35:06.082 --> 35:08.353
No.

35:08.388 --> 35:08.794
That was part of the marital discord.

35:09.290 --> 35:10.404
Check this out.

35:17.510 --> 35:19.198
Claire Wallace did have a dog.

35:20.204 --> 35:20.817
Yeah.

35:20.818 --> 35:22.665
Yeah, I interviewed her sister.

35:22.823 --> 35:25.630
Said Claire had a little
bulldog named, uh...

35:26.131 --> 35:27.622
think it was Sneakers.

35:27.635 --> 35:29.110
Took him everywhere with her.

35:29.239 --> 35:30.590
What's this around the neck?

35:32.948 --> 35:34.156
It's a wire.

35:34.451 --> 35:35.706
Killed the dog.

35:35.855 --> 35:40.627
He had to kill the dog to make it look
like Claire took Sneakers with her.

35:40.662 --> 35:40.662
Otherwise, nobody'd believe his story.

35:40.967 --> 35:42.879
No collar or tags down here,

35:43.373 --> 35:45.648
but I found this...

35:46.080 --> 35:47.234
whatever it is.

35:56.204 --> 35:58.475
Really thin, high-bridge nose.

35:58.811 --> 36:00.546
All indicate caucasoid.

36:01.718 --> 36:03.021
Any chance at an I.D.?

36:03.221 --> 36:04.122
Well, so far,

36:04.123 --> 36:06.128
everything's consistent
with Claire Wallace.

36:06.529 --> 36:07.230
Unfortunately,

36:07.231 --> 36:09.135
because she was in a
metal box in the desert,

36:09.136 --> 36:10.839
DNA's not likely viable.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.144
I sent samples of the
long bones to Wendy anyway,

36:13.145 --> 36:15.564
but I don't expect results.

36:15.651 --> 36:16.725
Dental records?

36:17.456 --> 36:19.941
The, uh, killer knocked
out most of her teeth.

36:20.563 --> 36:22.021
Roots are still in the bone.

36:22.869 --> 36:24.221
She was brutalized.

36:25.576 --> 36:27.078
Cause of death?

36:27.079 --> 36:29.585
I noted three separate
and distinct fractures:

36:29.686 --> 36:31.089
One on the right side...

36:32.392 --> 36:34.908
and two distinct
fractures on the left side.

36:35.199 --> 36:38.406
We were able to identify
the missing skull fragments,

36:38.407 --> 36:41.414
but when I tried to fit them
back together, I couldn't.

36:41.815 --> 36:43.794
There was deformation of the bones.

36:45.023 --> 36:47.127
Pre or peri-mortem,

36:47.128 --> 36:49.733
the human skull has an elastic quality,

36:49.734 --> 36:51.437
so when there's a fracture,

36:51.438 --> 36:53.643
the pieces will change shape.

36:53.644 --> 36:55.046
But post-mortem,

36:55.047 --> 36:56.349
the bone is brittle,

36:56.350 --> 36:57.552
and when it's fractured,

36:57.553 --> 36:58.957
the pieces retain their shape.

36:59.057 --> 37:01.262
It's not unlike breaking
a vase or a bowl.

37:01.764 --> 37:03.969
The pieces all fit together
like a jigsaw puzzle.

37:04.871 --> 37:07.792
So based on the fractures to her skull,

37:08.179 --> 37:11.787
it appears she was struck in
the head three separate times,

37:11.788 --> 37:14.194
and since the pieces
won't fit back together,

37:15.296 --> 37:18.733
blunt force trauma to
her skull is your COD.

37:25.722 --> 37:30.066
Did you know that there are
approximately 280 bones in a dog's body?

37:30.132 --> 37:30.934
Yeah?

37:31.235 --> 37:31.836
Well, the, uh,

37:31.837 --> 37:33.640
forensic vet should be here soon.

37:33.641 --> 37:37.349
Hopefully, he'll be able to determine
whether this is a french bulldog.

37:37.350 --> 37:39.955
I'm thinking this dog was an amputee.

37:39.956 --> 37:40.958
Based on what?

37:40.959 --> 37:42.229
This contraption.

37:43.164 --> 37:43.965
Looks like the, uh,

37:43.966 --> 37:46.348
canine equivalent of a wheelchair.

37:46.673 --> 37:49.980
My grandmother had a neighbor
whose dog was hit by a car.

37:49.981 --> 37:50.782
The dog lived,

37:50.783 --> 37:55.220
but the doctor had to amputate
the hind legs mid-femur.

37:56.096 --> 37:58.701
This is the hind femur,

37:58.702 --> 37:59.804
or what's left of it.

37:59.805 --> 38:01.511
You see how it was cut?

38:05.418 --> 38:07.923
You know, if sneakers
here was a handicapped dog,

38:07.924 --> 38:10.075
IDing it just became a whole lot easier.

38:10.631 --> 38:11.632
If we can ID the dog,

38:11.633 --> 38:13.236
it'd at least give us
a compelling argument

38:13.237 --> 38:15.042
that the body found was Claire Wallace.

38:15.142 --> 38:17.548
Yeah, but even with a cause
of death of blunt force trauma,

38:17.648 --> 38:18.851
we still don't have
enough to arrest him.

38:18.951 --> 38:22.358
So what, we refocus on Sedona Wiley?

38:22.359 --> 38:23.461
Well, it's like a chinese puzzle.

38:23.462 --> 38:24.764
She knew who Wallace was,

38:24.765 --> 38:25.910
but Wallace didn't know her.

38:26.369 --> 38:27.070
Greg's suspect,

38:27.071 --> 38:28.072
Damon Mitchell,

38:28.073 --> 38:30.517
claims that she tried
to extort money from him.

38:30.552 --> 38:32.947
So maybe she hit up Wallace, too.

38:34.790 --> 38:37.897
702-555-0122.

38:38.398 --> 38:40.869
That's GW Security.

38:40.904 --> 38:41.267
That's Wallace's company.

38:41.305 --> 38:44.048
She called that number three
times in the last week or so.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.113
She was reaching out to him.

38:46.117 --> 38:48.812
She called him again four
days before she was murdered.

38:48.824 --> 38:50.239
Upping the ante, maybe.

38:56.141 --> 38:56.943
Hi.

38:58.447 --> 39:00.319
Maybe he went there to intimidate her.

39:01.855 --> 39:03.058
So she was shaking him down

39:03.158 --> 39:05.392
when he went in the
store to shake her up.

39:05.665 --> 39:06.266
You know, Wallace said

39:06.366 --> 39:08.672
it was the singer's idea
to go in there, not his.

39:08.872 --> 39:09.573
Yeah, he also said

39:09.574 --> 39:11.578
he didn't murder his wife.

39:11.579 --> 39:13.082
You know, the girls
said something curious-

39:13.083 --> 39:14.779
the two that found the body.

39:15.388 --> 39:17.406
I didn't think it was
important at the time.

39:17.594 --> 39:18.795
When they left the store,

39:18.796 --> 39:20.793
a car almost ran them down.

39:23.909 --> 39:24.711
Jerk!

39:26.716 --> 39:28.821
So, your hand made contact
with the hood of the car?

39:29.021 --> 39:29.823
You bet it did.

39:29.924 --> 39:31.186
I was born in Manhattan.

39:31.227 --> 39:34.471
Well, I'm going to need an impression
of your palm and your fingerprints.

39:34.835 --> 39:36.544
If it helps nail the guy, sure.

39:37.642 --> 39:38.944
Do you remember anything
about the vehicle?

39:38.945 --> 39:40.964
Was it a car, a truck, SUV?

39:41.953 --> 39:43.235
I think it was a car.

39:43.356 --> 39:44.576
What color was it?

39:45.060 --> 39:46.056
It was red.

39:46.163 --> 39:48.309
Stuck in my head after
what the psychic said.

39:49.070 --> 39:50.339
Blood red.

40:15.534 --> 40:16.336
Voila.

40:27.864 --> 40:30.467
You sad old man.

40:30.771 --> 40:32.696
Is this all you have to live for?

40:34.380 --> 40:37.611
Palm prints on the hood of the car
appears to be a solid match to Anna Leah.

40:37.788 --> 40:38.896
Who's that?

40:39.292 --> 40:42.866
She's a good witness

40:42.901 --> 40:43.273
who places your car outside the
shop on the night of the murder.

40:43.903 --> 40:45.948
Maybe I was in the neighborhood.

40:46.409 --> 40:48.393
It's not a crime to drive around Vegas.

40:49.116 --> 40:51.320
I was only in that shop once,

40:51.321 --> 40:53.133
and I got my own witness.

40:53.168 --> 40:54.711
You got nothing.

40:56.333 --> 40:59.247
Our warrant also includes your shoes.

40:59.541 --> 41:00.918
You like 'em?

41:01.045 --> 41:02.435
They're new.

41:02.950 --> 41:04.477
Threw the old ones away.

41:05.556 --> 41:07.640
May I take a look at
your wallet, please?

41:07.675 --> 41:08.555
What for?

41:09.265 --> 41:10.913
Because I can.

41:25.204 --> 41:27.553
You didn't make a purchase
at that shop, did you?

41:28.211 --> 41:29.862
Already told you that.

41:30.918 --> 41:32.222
Gold flecks...

41:32.321 --> 41:36.207
similar to the substance we found
in Sedona Wiley's cash register.

41:45.553 --> 41:48.070
You took the money to make
it look like a robbery.

41:48.159 --> 41:49.338
We got him.

41:49.663 --> 41:50.364
You know, Packey,

41:50.365 --> 41:52.469
you've been waiting
a long time for this.

41:52.470 --> 41:53.953
Why don't you take him down?

41:56.179 --> 41:58.825
I couldn't get you for
the murder of your wife,

41:58.885 --> 42:02.352
but you are now under arrest
for the murder of Sedona Wiley.

42:08.910 --> 42:10.212
You have to admit,

42:10.213 --> 42:12.016
it's, uh, pretty eerie-

42:12.017 --> 42:14.129
Sedona's visions of her own death.

42:14.824 --> 42:15.910
Yeah.

42:16.428 --> 42:18.833
Maybe you should ask
Nana Olaf to contact her,

42:18.834 --> 42:20.088
see how she's doing.

42:21.841 --> 42:23.582
Yeah, I know you're a cynic.

42:24.247 --> 42:24.948
I just think

42:24.949 --> 42:29.855
that you can have beliefs
and still be a scientist.

42:30.061 --> 42:31.227
I agree.

42:32.066 --> 42:35.691
The problems arise when people
mistake their beliefs for the science.

42:38.381 --> 42:40.283
I've been reading her notebooks.

42:43.594 --> 42:45.110
Take a look at this.

42:52.115 --> 42:55.797
"She is in summerland...

42:55.832 --> 42:58.979
"but there is chaos and
darkness surrounding her.

42:59.332 --> 43:00.791
She is in summerland,

43:01.036 --> 43:03.638
but she can't cross over yet. "

43:05.146 --> 43:08.529
Sedona said Claire Wallace
was "in summerland,"

43:08.755 --> 43:10.681
not buried in Summerlin.

43:11.362 --> 43:12.775
What's summerland?

43:12.865 --> 43:14.847
Pagans believe it's a mystical place

43:15.076 --> 43:18.682
where souls go to rest
before they reincarnate.

43:18.690 --> 43:21.686
So Jameson heard Summerlin...

43:21.687 --> 43:23.491
because he was desperate
to solve the case.

43:23.892 --> 43:26.261
Then when Wallace heard Summerlin...

43:26.899 --> 43:29.265
he assumed Sedona was the real deal.

43:32.112 --> 43:33.738
The power of suggestion.
