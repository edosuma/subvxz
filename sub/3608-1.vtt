00:02.044 --> 00:03.127
Previously on Lost:

00:03.212 --> 00:08.508
The Others are coming. You have
only three choices: run, hide, or die.

00:08.592 --> 00:11.260
- We do have a plan.
- Yeah, go to the jungle,

00:11.345 --> 00:14.806
get some dynamite, blow open a hatch,
hide everyone inside.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.432
No.

00:17.643 --> 00:20.103
Stop! Stop it!

00:20.229 --> 00:23.439
Stop it, we can't!
Stop, don't light it!

04:14.504 --> 04:16.880
Four, eight, 15, 16, 23, 42.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.591
Four, eight, we're dead,
15, doomed and dead,

04:19.676 --> 04:21.218
- 16, 23...
- Hurley, you OK?

04:21.345 --> 04:24.263
Huh? Yeah. Awesome.
I just... have to pee.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.224
Great idea, dude,
go look in the burning death hole.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.826
What is it?

04:45.911 --> 04:48.037
It doesn't matter what it is.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.666
We blew the door so we could
get everyone inside so they'd be safe.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.711
That plan is not gonna work.
We'll never get everyone down in time.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.350
- Water.
- Shallow. Sounds like a puddle.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.310
- Forty feet down?
- Fifty, tops.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.897
We could use the wire from the fuselage,
rig up a harness...

05:14.982 --> 05:18.985
- John, we're leaving now.
- Yes. Good idea, let's do that.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.863
- We all went through a lot to get here.
- The ladder is broken.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.242
You're gonna lower
40 people down there one by one?

05:26.368 --> 05:28.953
They're waiting for us
to tell them what do,

05:29.079 --> 05:31.080
- so forget the harnesses.
- Jack...

05:31.164 --> 05:32.748
What?

05:32.874 --> 05:35.126
Why don't we all just calm down here?

05:35.210 --> 05:39.505
If you wanna go exploring in the
morning, fine, but tonight we're done.

05:39.589 --> 05:43.759
I'm gonna get the dynamite we didn't use
and we're heading back to the caves.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.929
So how about you pack it up, John?

05:54.438 --> 05:56.313
Sure. Of course.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.109
OK.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.448
Why don't you want
to go down there, Jack?

06:09.619 --> 06:13.330
Female, late 20s, no ID.
Coded twice on the way over here...

06:13.415 --> 06:16.042
- Where's the other one?
- They're on their way.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.045
- Fire department had to use the Jaws.
- What do we got?

06:19.129 --> 06:22.256
- Female, late 20s, auto accident.
- What is that?

06:22.340 --> 06:26.052
A piece of the steering column.
Let's go. Keep that collar steady.

06:26.136 --> 06:29.680
- Page my father. Tell me.
- Tire blew, car jumped the divider,

06:29.765 --> 06:31.307
- hit an SUV.
- BP's dropping!

06:31.391 --> 06:33.726
Pericardial's pierced. Was she driving?

06:33.810 --> 06:36.312
- Yeah. Alone.
- Where's the driver of the SUV?

06:36.438 --> 06:37.646
Watch your back.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.733
Adam Rutherford, 57,
chest trauma, no breath sounds.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.986
- Tube Mr. Rutherford...
- I can't intubate, you've got to.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.656
- Dr. Shephard, her BP's 80/60.
- His breathing's deteriorating.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.368
- Let's get a move on.
- OK. I need a syringe. A big one.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.704
- You, hold pressure.
- Five gauge.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.998
- Pupils?
- Fixed and dilated.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.584
- ...guys.
- By carotid.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.587
88/52, no radial pulse.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.964
I know, I know. Sac's flooded.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.760
- Where's that...?
- Here. Got it?

07:07.886 --> 07:09.220
Yep.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.516
- He's dropping, come on.
- Doctor, we're losing him!

07:16.895 --> 07:18.771
BP's stabilizing.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.233
Time of death: 8:15am.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.573
- OK. Get me a blood gas and a C-spine.
- Right away, doctor.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.409
Get her up to ICU
and keep her immobilized.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.000
I wanna dance at my wedding.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.546
- Did you hear that?
- You need to take it easy, OK?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.714
- Just relax...
- What did she say?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.968
She said she has to dance
at her wedding.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.263
I wanna dance.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.984
OK, no one is out there.
No one is coming.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.735
But the French woman said...

08:06.862 --> 08:09.446
The French woman
is missing a bloody wing nut.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.241
I mean, it was all bollocks.
It's a ghost story.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.618
She set the fire herself.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.247
What?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.749
Nothing.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.006
Has anyone seen Vincent?

08:27.090 --> 08:29.508
- The dog? Anyone seen him?
- No, I haven't.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.428
- Has anyone seen the dog?
- No.

08:35.472 --> 08:38.517
- Where are you going?
- I lost the damn dog.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.695
Why'd you do that?

08:49.779 --> 08:51.614
Why'd you light the fuse, man?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.993
Why wouldn't I light the fuse?

08:56.828 --> 08:59.997
Maybe because I was running
towards you, waving my arms,

09:00.123 --> 09:02.208
yelling, "Don't do that!"

09:04.628 --> 09:06.962
Well, you've got a point there.

09:08.340 --> 09:12.051
I guess I was excited to get inside.
That's why we came here, isn't it?

09:12.135 --> 09:14.303
That's why we went out
to the Black Rock,

09:14.429 --> 09:16.555
and got the dynamite to blow the hatch.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.807
We did it so we could get inside, Hugo.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.893
And to save everybody's lives.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.854
And to save everyone's lives.

09:24.356 --> 09:28.234
Or maybe it was just our destiny.
Right, John?

09:28.318 --> 09:29.818
Maybe.

09:29.945 --> 09:34.490
Guys. It's the hatch door.
You'd better see this.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.252
- Vincent!
- This is not a good idea.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.087
I saw him five minutes ago.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.839
Besides,
you said there wasn't anyone out here.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.591
I said we didn't see anyone.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.386
The dog will come back on his own,
he always does.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.723
Watching that dog was the one thing
anybody ever asked me to do.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.142
If something happens to him...

10:02.227 --> 10:06.438
When was the last time you slept or
had something to eat? You're exhausted.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.858
I can't tell that kid I lost his dog
because I was exhausted.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.702
- I'll circle around behind him.
- OK.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.339
Vincent!

10:32.549 --> 10:44.393
Sayid!

10:44.477 --> 10:46.937
Where are you!? Sayid!

10:53.611 --> 10:55.154
Sayid?

11:20.055 --> 11:21.180
Walt?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.772
What are you doing here?

11:32.650 --> 11:34.193
Shannon!

11:35.445 --> 11:36.945
What is it?

11:42.243 --> 11:43.660
What?

11:52.670 --> 11:55.172
Why do you want
to get down there so bad?

11:56.091 --> 11:59.385
"-ly." Why do I want to get
down there so "badly"?

12:01.429 --> 12:03.389
Jack thinks I'm crazy, doesn't he?

12:03.473 --> 12:07.559
Why? 'Cause you want to drop into a
hatch that's been locked from the inside

12:07.644 --> 12:10.979
by a foot-thick steel door
that says "quarantine"?

12:11.064 --> 12:13.399
Look at the bright side,
the damage is done.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.984
Bright side.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.863
And if Jack thinks I've lost it,
I can't blame him, really.

12:19.948 --> 12:23.075
Then again, five hours ago
I was pulled into a hole

12:23.159 --> 12:25.702
by what appeared to be
a column of black smoke.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.663
Did you see it, Kate?

12:32.335 --> 12:34.586
Then I guess we're both crazy.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.173
I wonder what Jack thinks he saw.

12:43.179 --> 12:47.015
You should go ahead, man. Don't want
Locke making time with your girl.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.434
Joke, dude.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.269
Not really in the mood, Hurley.

12:50.353 --> 12:53.730
Really? Wow.
Usually you're like, Mr. Ha-ha.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.360
There ya go. Life's not so bad, right?

12:58.987 --> 13:01.780
Sure, the Others
are coming to like, eat us all,

13:01.865 --> 13:05.075
and every once in a while
someone blows up all over you,

13:05.201 --> 13:07.578
but we do get to sleep in every morning.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.081
And the numbers?

13:12.542 --> 13:14.626
- What?
- "The numbers are bad."

13:14.711 --> 13:18.505
That's what you were yelling
right when I tackled you.

13:18.590 --> 13:22.801
- Yeah. It's kind of a long story.
- I've got time.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.679
- You'll think I'm crazy.
- Try me.

13:29.893 --> 13:34.563
A while ago, I was in this kind of psych
ward and there was this guy, Leonard.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.900
All the time I knew him,
all he ever said were these numbers,

13:37.984 --> 13:42.321
"four, eight, 15, 16, 23, 42,"
over and over and over again.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.531
And they kind of got stuck in my head.

13:44.616 --> 13:48.619
So when I got out... well, actually
a couple months after I got out,

13:48.703 --> 13:52.664
I was buying a frozen burrito and
thought "I should play the lottery,"

13:52.749 --> 13:56.251
and I guess those numbers
were stuck in my head, so I played them.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.755
And I won... $114 million.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.218
That's when it started happening.
My grandpa died,

14:04.302 --> 14:06.678
my house caught on fire,

14:06.763 --> 14:10.098
the chicken joint that I worked at
got hit by a meteor...

14:10.225 --> 14:12.643
Well, actually, a meteorite.

14:13.728 --> 14:18.106
OK, so tonight, I see the same
freaking numbers on that hatch thing.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.234
Just written on the side.

14:20.318 --> 14:24.154
And that's why I tried to stop it
because that thing is cursed, man.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.869
You were in a psych ward?

14:32.455 --> 14:34.873
- I'm not crazy.
- I'm not saying you are.

14:36.417 --> 14:40.045
- So, what, that's it? That's all?
- What do you want me to say?

14:40.129 --> 14:44.341
- How about you believe me, man?
- Hurley, they're numbers.

14:46.970 --> 14:51.974
What's that thing where doctors make you
feel better just by talking to you?

14:52.058 --> 14:54.560
- Bedside manner.
- Yeah, that.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.729
Yours sucks, dude.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.079
What happened to him?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.999
Just try to relax, OK?

15:18.668 --> 15:22.379
The car that I hit.
The other driver was older...

15:23.047 --> 15:24.673
He died in the ER.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.972
I can't feel anything.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.309
I know.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.606
What's happened to me?

15:41.691 --> 15:45.277
You have a fracture dislocation
of your thoracic lumbar spine,

15:45.361 --> 15:47.654
with multiple crushed vertebrae.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.658
Your back is broken.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.369
Your spleen is ruptured

15:54.495 --> 15:57.414
and bleeding into your abdomen
and has to be stopped.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.125
I'm gonna operate
and repair as much as possible,

16:00.209 --> 16:05.714
but even the most optimistic result puts
the likelihood of retaining any feeling

16:05.798 --> 16:08.300
or mobility anywhere
below the waist at...

16:09.719 --> 16:12.179
...extremely unlikely.

16:17.352 --> 16:21.188
Dr. Shephard, may I have a word, please?

16:26.027 --> 16:28.904
- So, what'd I do wrong?
- You did something wrong?

16:29.656 --> 16:32.240
- You're frowning.
- My face is always this way.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.952
Dad, hey, come on, let's hear it.

16:37.789 --> 16:42.376
You might want to try handing out
some hope every once in a while?

16:44.212 --> 16:46.713
Even if there's
a 99 percent probability

16:46.798 --> 16:49.007
that they're hopelessly screwed,

16:49.092 --> 16:53.512
folks are much more inclined
to hear that one percent chance

16:53.596 --> 16:55.931
that things are gonna be OK.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.100
Her spine is crushed.

16:58.184 --> 17:02.396
I tell her that everything's
gonna be OK, that's false hope, Dad.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.606
Maybe. Maybe.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.526
But it's still hope.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.785
X-ray to the ER.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.710
I know what I saw!
It was him. It was Walt.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.462
- Please lower your voice.
- I heard whispers.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.880
- Where?
- Everywhere.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.383
- What whispers? Who?
- I don't know! Them!

17:31.467 --> 17:34.469
- Something happened to the raft?
- Nothing happened.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.140
- Walt was with your husband, Sawyer...
- Sayid, I know what I saw!

17:38.224 --> 17:40.308
They're back.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.578
Locke found a...

17:59.662 --> 18:03.623
...hatch in the ground
about a half mile from here.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.836
We left to blow it open
so that we could hide inside.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.047
So all of us could hide inside
in case...

18:14.844 --> 18:17.220
But it doesn't matter,
it's not gonna work.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.098
There's no way for all of us
to get in there tonight.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.018
Jack, where's Dr. Arzt?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.941
- He didn't make it.
- What?

18:30.026 --> 18:32.277
- Oh, my God.
- Did you see them?

18:32.361 --> 18:36.198
- Did you see the Others?
- Hey! Shannon! There are no Others.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.201
- We've had this conversation.
- What would you know?

18:39.285 --> 18:42.621
You didn't see anything.
You don't know! You don't know!

18:42.705 --> 18:44.331
Hey!

18:54.133 --> 18:56.259
Everything's going to be OK.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.763
Let's just... let's take it easy.
We're gonna be all right.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.724
We're gonna stay here tonight, OK?
Together.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.478
We've still got four guns.
We'll put lookouts at all the entrances.

19:08.439 --> 19:11.399
We're all gonna be safe
as long as we stay together.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.779
The sun comes up in three hours,

19:15.905 --> 19:18.573
and we are all gonna be here
to see that happen.

19:22.245 --> 19:24.329
I promise.

19:34.465 --> 19:38.593
- John. What are you doing?
- I'm getting some cable.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.972
What for?

19:42.056 --> 19:44.599
It's for the hatch. I'm going in.

19:51.399 --> 19:54.860
You think that's the smartest thing
to do right now, John?

19:54.944 --> 19:57.779
I doubt it. In fact, you're right.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.616
Safest thing is to stay here.
Wait for morning.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.662
Wait for these Others,
to see if they ever show up.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.125
Wait for the brave folks on the raft
to bring help.

20:11.502 --> 20:14.004
But me? I'm tired of waiting.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.071
So do you believe it?

20:44.327 --> 20:45.994
Believe what?

20:47.830 --> 20:49.748
That everything's gonna be OK.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.921
Yeah. I do.

20:56.964 --> 21:01.426
Kind of unlike you.
The whole glass-half-full thing.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.595
There's a glass?

21:09.936 --> 21:12.854
You did a good thing.
Saying what you said.

21:14.315 --> 21:19.319
Taking care of everybody and...
just giving them something to count on.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.951
If you weren't here, Jack...

21:32.708 --> 21:34.793
I'm going to the hatch.

21:36.253 --> 21:40.966
I understand why you can't go. I mean,
they need you here, I get it. I do.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.889
But Locke's going into that thing
whether you like it or not.

21:48.891 --> 21:51.059
And if he falls and breaks his neck...

21:54.730 --> 21:57.065
Live together, die alone, right?

22:02.238 --> 22:03.780
Right.

22:12.707 --> 22:14.874
Your fiancée was seriously injured.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.211
It could take as long
as ten, maybe 12 hours.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.673
I won't know how extensive the damage is
until I get inside.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.764
She was going for a dress fitting
and to look at tablecloths.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.520
When is it? The wedding?

22:35.604 --> 22:38.023
It's eight months.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.860
I'm sure Sarah will have recovered
by then, if...

22:41.944 --> 22:45.530
"Recovered"? What does that mean?

22:45.614 --> 22:47.866
There will be ongoing physical therapy,

22:47.950 --> 22:51.036
- but if she works really hard...
- Will we be able to...

22:52.204 --> 22:54.414
...you know... make love?

22:58.169 --> 23:00.295
You need to know that there is a chance

23:00.421 --> 23:04.632
Sarah might very well need professional
care for the rest of her life.

23:05.760 --> 23:09.804
What, like, she won't be able
to go to the bathroom by herself?

23:26.655 --> 23:31.910
Come here.

23:34.497 --> 23:36.998
I want to tell you a little secret.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.251
Come on.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.173
Closer.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.680
It's OK.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.685
I know I'm not gonna be dancing anymore.

24:04.527 --> 24:08.154
I can still roll around at my wedding.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.868
You're invited, OK?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.835
I'm going to fix you.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.287
Expected to find you
halfway down there by now.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.415
I was waiting for you.

25:10.926 --> 25:14.888
- So you want me to go down first?
- Well, you're lighter.

25:14.972 --> 25:18.641
I can belay you down
and bring you back up just as easy.

25:18.726 --> 25:21.019
Shaft might get
narrower down there too.

25:21.103 --> 25:25.064
You left out the part where you just
wanna see if I get eaten by something.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.275
Yeah, well, that too.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.114
- Not too tight?
- I've got it.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.122
OK.

25:58.933 --> 26:00.308
Wait.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.977
What do I say if need to stop?

26:04.021 --> 26:05.647
"Stop."

26:09.652 --> 26:12.070
Right. OK. Let's go.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.584
Kate! Are you all right?

27:12.381 --> 27:13.589
Yeah.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.345
I dropped the light.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.556
Maybe we should...

27:22.933 --> 27:24.809
Well, OK, then.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.407
One.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.244
Two.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.747
Three.

27:47.416 --> 27:48.624
Four.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.670
Stop!

27:59.303 --> 28:00.345
What is it?

28:00.429 --> 28:03.181
John! I think there's something down...

28:12.649 --> 28:14.359
Kate, are you all right?

28:32.086 --> 28:33.544
Kate!

28:42.930 --> 28:45.807
You're kidding, right?
You're going back?

28:47.101 --> 28:49.477
- Yeah.
- What about all that stuff you said

28:49.561 --> 28:52.855
about waiting until morning
and watching the sun rise?

28:53.607 --> 28:55.817
I changed my mind.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.302
Kate!

29:24.555 --> 29:26.431
Locke!

30:52.059 --> 30:53.643
Damn it!

30:53.769 --> 30:56.646
- You all right, brother?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.732
Take it easy, keep the weight off.
Here, let me look.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.236
Does this hurt?

31:03.362 --> 31:05.488
Well, you haven't sprained it, then.

31:06.114 --> 31:09.158
I don't fancy your chances
of catching up with me, though.

31:09.284 --> 31:12.703
- I wasn't trying to catch up.
- Oh, aye, 'course you weren't.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.918
- What do you know about sprains?
- I was almost a doctor, once.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.004
Small world.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.173
You're a doctor, then?

31:36.812 --> 31:40.648
- So, what's your excuse?
- Excuse?

31:40.774 --> 31:43.276
For running
like the devil's chasing you?

31:44.111 --> 31:46.696
My excuse: I'm training.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.658
- Training for what?
- For a race around the world.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.245
Impressive, I know.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.666
So your excuse better be good, brother.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.003
Just trying to work a few things out.

32:04.298 --> 32:06.382
A girl, right?

32:07.676 --> 32:11.053
- A patient.
- Ah, but a girl patient.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.018
What's her name?

32:19.855 --> 32:23.441
- Her name's Sarah.
- What'd you do to her, then?

32:24.151 --> 32:25.192
Do to her?

32:25.277 --> 32:29.071
You must have done something worthy
of this self-flagellation.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.576
I told her...

32:34.703 --> 32:37.038
I made a promise I couldn't keep.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.751
I told her I'd fix her and I couldn't.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.212
I failed.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.426
Well, right.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.638
Just one thing...

32:56.141 --> 32:57.892
What if you did fix her?

32:59.186 --> 33:00.978
- I didn't.
- But what if you did?

33:01.521 --> 33:03.981
You don't know
what you're talking about.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.399
I don't? Why not?

33:05.525 --> 33:08.903
With her situation,
that would be a miracle, brother.

33:11.907 --> 33:14.241
And you don't believe in miracles.

33:18.288 --> 33:23.626
Right. Well, then...
I'm gonna give you some advice, anyway.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.256
You have to lift it up.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.348
Lift it up?

33:40.268 --> 33:43.437
Your ankle. You got to keep it elevated.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.901
It's been nice chatting...

33:49.611 --> 33:53.614
- Jack.
- Jack, I'm Desmond.

33:54.658 --> 33:57.993
Well, good luck, brother.
See you in another life, yeah?

37:45.972 --> 37:48.015
I wouldn't do that.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.518
Where's Kate?

37:52.604 --> 37:54.480
What the hell's...

38:13.959 --> 38:15.542
Am I alive?

38:19.965 --> 38:23.217
Yeah. Yeah, you're alive.

38:30.100 --> 38:33.102
You smell.

38:33.186 --> 38:36.939
- Well, thank you.
- Wow, you really smell.

38:38.483 --> 38:42.152
Yeah, I went for a run.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.405
You smell like you ran far.

38:45.865 --> 38:48.951
Well, I showered.
I guess I just didn't cool...

38:49.077 --> 38:51.954
I wanted to get back down here
and check on you and...

38:52.080 --> 38:54.456
It was a tour de stade.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.167
What?

38:58.420 --> 39:02.756
When you run all the steps in every
section of a stadium. Up and down.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.719
Why would you do that?

39:09.055 --> 39:10.764
I'm intense.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.437
- Did you finish?
- No, I hurt my ankle.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.733
That sucks for you.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.114
Is Kevin here? My fiancé?

39:28.366 --> 39:30.325
I didn't see him.

39:31.369 --> 39:36.123
- I'm sure he'll be back in a little...
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.587
Are you gonna tell me how it went?

39:47.302 --> 39:49.219
Sarah, the...

39:49.971 --> 39:52.890
The damage to your back was extensive.

39:57.604 --> 40:01.315
I did everything that I could,
but your spinal column, I just...

40:05.987 --> 40:08.280
I couldn't repair it.

40:10.992 --> 40:14.995
You're going to be paralyzed from the
waist down for the rest of your life.

40:18.166 --> 40:21.335
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Sarah.

40:26.549 --> 40:29.009
You're yanking my chain, right?

40:31.012 --> 40:32.513
No.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.267
Then how come I can wiggle my toes?

41:00.708 --> 41:02.751
Can you feel this?

41:03.419 --> 41:04.545
Yes.

41:06.631 --> 41:09.550
- Can you feel this?
- Yes.

41:10.301 --> 41:17.724
- This?
- Yes.

41:40.874 --> 41:43.750
Move and I kill him.

41:44.586 --> 41:46.962
Put the gun down.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.964
- Where's Kate?
- Jack, it's OK...

41:49.048 --> 41:50.924
- I said, drop it!
- Where's Kate?

41:51.009 --> 41:54.469
- She's fine. Put down...
- I'm not putting down anything!

41:54.596 --> 41:57.181
Do you want him to die? Put it down.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.645
Is this what you were talking about,
Locke?

42:03.730 --> 42:05.772
Is this your destiny?

42:07.442 --> 42:09.902
- "All roads lead here?"
- Jack, calm down.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.865
Lower your gun, or I'll blow
his damned head off, brother!

42:26.669 --> 42:28.712
You?
