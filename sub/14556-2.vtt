00:21.589 --> 00:26.194
CHARLIE: Bank robbers are
creatures of habit.

00:26.227 --> 00:31.299
Once they develop a successful
routine, they stick to it.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.402
Time of day, day of the week,
choice of weapon, disguise,

00:34.435 --> 00:38.439
region-- these will be
the same again and again.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.510
It's actually
a lot like these fish.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.511
Given enough time,

00:43.544 --> 00:46.580
it's possible to discern
a distinct pattern

00:46.614 --> 00:47.581
that each one will follow.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.050
Well, mathematicians,
they do so love

00:50.084 --> 00:52.220
finding these
patterns, don't they?

00:52.253 --> 00:54.188
Tell me,
what have you gleaned

00:54.222 --> 00:57.024
from this set
of repeated crime phenomena?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.360
An equation, for the FBI,

00:59.393 --> 01:01.329
that predicts when and where

01:01.362 --> 01:04.198
these two particular robbers
will strike next.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.067
I told my brother,
they'd hit today...

01:07.101 --> 01:08.736
Curtis, you see anything?

01:08.769 --> 01:10.638
Clear.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.540
Keith?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.342
Clear.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.413
CHARLIE:
...at one of two locations...

01:30.391 --> 01:33.361
They've hit 16 banks
in eight months.

01:33.394 --> 01:36.630
The FBI's nicknamed them
the Charm School Boys

01:36.664 --> 01:38.399
because they're
so nice and polite.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.534
They don't use
weapons or threats.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.470
They say "please"
and "thank you."

01:42.503 --> 01:44.238
They even open doors
for other bank customers

01:44.272 --> 01:45.706
on their way in and out.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.542
Using a combination
of probability modeling

01:48.576 --> 01:52.313
and statistical analysis, I've
pinpointed the next robbery.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.782
It's 1:30.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.016
If these guys actually show

01:56.049 --> 01:58.118
within the time window
Charlie's predicted,

01:58.152 --> 01:59.119
it's kind of amazing.

01:59.153 --> 02:00.120
Yeah, I know.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.189
DON:
Want to hear something wild?

02:01.222 --> 02:03.391
When I was in college,
I played baseball.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.426
Charlie could predict
the amount of walks

02:05.459 --> 02:07.495
I was gonna get
just by my stance.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.563
Charles, I have no doubt
in your ability

02:09.597 --> 02:12.233
to predict the movements
of fish and men,

02:12.266 --> 02:14.435
but I would offer
one cautionary note,

02:14.468 --> 02:16.837
just colleague
to colleague.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.339
And what's that?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.441
Don't mistake
the ability to predict

02:20.474 --> 02:22.510
with the ability to control.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.446
Yeah, I think
I know the difference.

02:25.479 --> 02:30.017
Oh, to be young and brilliant
and full of yourself.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.252
Just consider.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.521
These Charm School Guys
or Boys or whatever,

02:33.554 --> 02:35.323
they have no idea
what's about to happen to them.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.292
But my equation does.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.534
I have the targets.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.236
Positive ID?

02:48.269 --> 02:50.771
Two Caucasian males,
mid- to late 30s.

02:50.804 --> 02:51.872
Baseball cap and sunglasses.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.140
I'm on my way. Let's go.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.508
Let's go. Let's go.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.619
Team Two Baker. You got 'em?

03:07.988 --> 03:08.922
Got 'em.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.791
Teller number three.

03:10.824 --> 03:11.792
We're moving.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.566
Everybody watch

03:18.599 --> 03:19.700
your line.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.074
Subject One
is asking the teller

03:27.107 --> 03:29.577
to hand him the cash drawer.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.150
They're coming out.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.219
David, what's your status?

03:39.253 --> 03:40.654
They're coming out, Don.

03:40.688 --> 03:41.689
We have to move in.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.656
DON:
Go.

03:46.093 --> 03:46.860
FBI!

03:46.894 --> 03:47.928
FBI!

03:49.162 --> 03:51.532
F! B! I!

03:54.201 --> 03:55.769
( gunfire )

04:09.683 --> 04:10.984
TERRY:
David, how many shooters?

04:11.018 --> 04:12.620
All units, what's going on?!

04:12.653 --> 04:14.021
Shots fired!

04:14.054 --> 04:15.122
Multiple shooters!

04:15.155 --> 04:17.658
Agent down!

04:17.691 --> 04:18.792
( gunfire )

04:21.595 --> 04:24.164
CHARLIE: We all use math every
day... every day...

04:24.197 --> 04:26.033
to predict weather...

04:26.066 --> 04:29.036
to tell time...

04:29.069 --> 04:32.239
to handle money...

04:32.272 --> 04:36.310
Math is more than formulas and
equations.

04:36.344 --> 04:39.380
It's logic.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.049
It's rationality.

04:42.082 --> 04:45.686
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

04:51.725 --> 05:01.502
( tires screeching, gunfire )

05:01.535 --> 05:02.736
( people screaming )

05:02.770 --> 05:03.871
Get down! Get down!

05:03.904 --> 05:05.305
Stay small!

05:05.339 --> 05:07.908
Get back! Get back!

05:07.941 --> 05:09.477
Get back!

05:11.979 --> 05:12.846
You all right?

05:13.981 --> 05:14.748
Cover me.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.816
( gunfire )

05:22.423 --> 05:23.290
Whatta you got?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.526
Agent down!

05:25.559 --> 05:26.494
I'm gonna go for McKnight.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.928
You cover me with this,
all right?

05:38.038 --> 05:41.108
This is a live breaking report
from the Channel 8 News...

05:41.141 --> 05:42.843
I also have a post-doc
who needs help

05:42.876 --> 05:44.712
with some references
on an article.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.581
Maybe you can recommend
a couple of math students?

05:47.615 --> 05:48.749
Well, wait.
Let's clarify.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.183
This is the
redheaded post-doc?

05:50.217 --> 05:51.585
Red hair and she
rollerblades?

05:51.619 --> 05:54.021
Yeah, you know.
Brilliant theoretician.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.456
Well, forget
the undergrads.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.457
I'll help her.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.793
...injured in the crossfire,
where a shootout

05:59.827 --> 06:01.862
between Federal agents and
suspected bank robbers

06:01.895 --> 06:02.830
is in progress.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.600
I see several people are lying
on the ground...

06:08.836 --> 06:09.903
Ray!

06:09.937 --> 06:10.471
Move!

06:30.357 --> 06:33.026
They're covering
their exit! Terry!

06:33.961 --> 06:35.295
Go.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.063
Ray.

06:36.096 --> 06:36.864
Move!

06:38.265 --> 06:44.137
( gunfire )

07:02.890 --> 07:05.826
( gunfire )

07:05.859 --> 07:08.295
Get your hands
where I can see them!

07:08.328 --> 07:10.297
Get those hands up!

07:10.330 --> 07:11.899
Freeze! Don't Move!

07:13.400 --> 07:14.134
Drop that radio!
Drop it!

07:26.614 --> 07:27.615
I got two suspects

07:27.648 --> 07:29.750
fleeing in a silver sedan,
license...

07:29.783 --> 07:31.451
OFFICER ( on radio ): ...in
progress, eight-year-old female.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.420
All available units
please respond.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.588
Uh, this is 1-Adam-6.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.590
Shouldn't we secure the area
before we pull out?

07:36.624 --> 07:37.625
They're in our system.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.326
They're in our
communications system.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.328
They're making false reports.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.030
Any available unit,
report to...

07:43.063 --> 07:44.064
Secure the area!

07:45.799 --> 07:47.601
Went that way!
Come on, come on!

08:37.384 --> 08:38.686
You hit?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.053
He's got my gun!

08:40.087 --> 08:41.188
( groans )

08:41.221 --> 08:42.389
- Go that way.
- You hit?

08:42.422 --> 08:44.625
Go that way!

08:45.125 --> 08:46.359
Where'd he go?

08:46.393 --> 08:48.161
I mean, how could we miss him?

09:20.093 --> 09:22.262
This is an active crime scene,
do you understand?

09:22.295 --> 09:23.296
Do you understand?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.398
I asked five
minutes ago and...

09:25.432 --> 09:27.267
Stop right there.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.769
It, it's okay. Let him through.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.994
Charlie.

09:55.996 --> 09:56.897
Charlie?

09:59.299 --> 10:00.200
Charlie?

10:17.017 --> 10:18.385
Where is Don?

10:23.691 --> 10:25.225
He's over there.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.397
Hey. Hey, Charlie,
how you doing?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.399
It's okay, really.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.801
It's fine.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.135
They weren't violent.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.003
There were two of them.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.739
Why 16 robberies
exactly the same,

10:38.772 --> 10:40.841
and then this?

10:40.874 --> 10:44.011
I mean, first of all, nobody
ever tried to stop them, right?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.813
And it wasn't just two guys.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.215
You know, they had four backing
them up. Yeah. We had

10:48.248 --> 10:49.416
no way of knowing

10:49.449 --> 10:50.483
till we
confronted them.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.919
That's it.
You're good to go.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.157
Nothing to Dad,
right?

10:58.258 --> 10:59.226
Charlie.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.393
Don't say anything to Dad.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.661
I'll take care of it, okay?

11:01.695 --> 11:03.797
You heard me,
right?

11:16.609 --> 11:17.945
Charm School Boys.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.647
I mean, I'm sorry, they
came prepared for war.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.182
DAVID:
We've got people looking

11:22.215 --> 11:24.517
at the security tapes
from the previous robberies

11:24.551 --> 11:25.986
to see if the same accomplices

11:26.019 --> 11:27.788
were present at those
incidents as well.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.022
And there's no doubt
in my mind

11:29.056 --> 11:32.325
that was a detailed
ambush-and-escape plan.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.261
And didn't hesitate to kill.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.970
( sighs )

11:43.003 --> 11:45.572
Well, from what I understand,
in the last five years,

11:45.605 --> 11:47.174
this office has lost
only two agents

11:47.207 --> 11:49.509
- in the line of fire?
- Mm-hmm.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.179
McKnight's parents are
flying in from Denver tonight.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.081
I'm gonna go talk to them
at the hotel.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.416
I mean, I don't know
what you say to a parent

11:56.449 --> 11:58.118
about their dead son.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.220
All right,
what have we got so far?

12:00.253 --> 12:03.924
Um, we think their crew consists
of at least six individuals.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.193
From the firearms,
use of explosives,

12:06.226 --> 12:07.360
the false 911 calls,

12:07.394 --> 12:08.561
we're assuming it's a team

12:08.595 --> 12:10.163
with extensive
training and experience.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.065
The gunman David
shot was identified

12:12.099 --> 12:14.601
by his driver's license
as Malcolm Stapleton, 36.

12:14.634 --> 12:15.869
Video game designer.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.905
No criminal record.
How does somebody go from

12:17.938 --> 12:19.807
no criminal record
to firing on Federal agents

12:19.840 --> 12:20.941
with an assault weapon?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.109
That's the question
we need to be asking.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.144
We need to know a lot more
about this dead guy.

12:24.177 --> 12:24.945
Already on it.

12:24.978 --> 12:25.412
That's the first thing
we need to know,

12:25.445 --> 12:27.247
and we have to assume with
their planning and preparation,

12:27.280 --> 12:28.982
they're not gonna hesitate
to hit another bank.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.951
So even though we're looking
at this guy, Charlie's equation,

12:30.984 --> 12:32.085
that's still
our best lead.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.520
Well, he was able to predict
today's robbery.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.422
He should be able to tell us
where they're gonna go next.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.894
Charlie...

12:40.928 --> 12:43.797
did you hear what I said?

12:43.831 --> 12:46.699
Oh, I'm just, uh...

12:46.733 --> 12:49.169
thinking.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.904
Uh...
( clears throat )

12:52.472 --> 12:54.241
( sighs )

12:54.274 --> 12:57.177
Understand this is
an entirely new problem now.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.613
The pattern I was working from
was a false pattern.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.083
No, no, not so much false
as incomplete.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.118
You were able to accurately
predict today's robbery.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.120
Right, but there's
new factors now, okay?

13:07.154 --> 13:08.956
They aren't two unarmed guys.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.158
So the assumptions
we made about them

13:11.191 --> 13:12.659
are invalid.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.161
DON: Okay, all right, all right,
look,

13:14.194 --> 13:15.595
so you take the new factors,
and you make

13:15.628 --> 13:17.464
- a new equation, right?
- It's not that easy, man.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.866
It's not that easy

13:18.899 --> 13:20.167
because, uh...

13:20.200 --> 13:23.070
there's something else
that has to be considered.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.171
Like what?

13:24.204 --> 13:27.207
Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Principle.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.109
Heisenberg noted
that the, uh, the act

13:29.142 --> 13:30.878
of observation
will affect the observed.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.313
In other words, when you
watch something, you change it.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.649
And, uh...
for example, like, an electron.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.151
You know, you can't
really measure it

13:38.185 --> 13:39.887
without bumping into it
in some small way.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.922
Any physical act of observation

13:41.955 --> 13:44.557
requires interaction
with a form of energy,

13:44.591 --> 13:46.326
like light,
and that will change

13:46.359 --> 13:49.296
the nature of the electron,
its path of travel.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.064
All right, all right,
hold on, hold on.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.599
You know I got, like,
a C in physics,

13:52.632 --> 13:53.733
so just take me through

13:53.766 --> 13:55.202
how this relates
to the case.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.005
Don...
you've observed the robbers.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.073
They know it; that will
change their actions.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.208
TERRY:
Okay, so they change

14:01.241 --> 14:03.743
their MO, but we don't have
to go back to square one.

14:03.776 --> 14:04.811
We know some things about them.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.446
We have a basis
for making some conclusions.

14:06.479 --> 14:10.483
Right. Good, but I, um...

14:10.517 --> 14:12.920
I can't help.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.221
I can't do this.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.223
TERRY:
Charlie, you feeling okay?

14:16.256 --> 14:18.858
Yeah, it's just my stomach's
been bothering me.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.827
That's normal.
Happens to a lot of us

14:20.860 --> 14:22.229
after something like today.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.430
Really? I was the
only one I know

14:23.463 --> 14:25.098
who was throwing up
at the crime scene.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.233
Look, buddy, come here.
Turn around.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.601
Charlie, listen to me:
what you saw

14:28.635 --> 14:29.836
was-was bad, okay?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.038
I know. Trust me.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.605
It takes a while
to process that.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.374
So what I want you to do
is go home.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.309
Come on. Put that down.
Give me that.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.778
Charlie, you go home
and you get some rest.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.048
Go, and when you come up with
something,

14:41.081 --> 14:42.482
just call us, all right?

14:42.515 --> 14:42.815
Charlie, call me
if you want

14:42.849 --> 14:44.451
- to talk about anything, okay?
- Charlie...

14:47.220 --> 14:49.389
We're counting on you, buddy.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.492
( sighs )

14:55.929 --> 14:57.297
What do you got?

14:57.330 --> 15:00.367
The explosive in the
car bomb was C-4.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.268
Check into that batch.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.436
How are we doing on
the fake 911 calls?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.672
Two individuals using
cell phones with scramblers.

15:05.705 --> 15:06.873
We're preparing
voice prints.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.808
We got any hits on crews
with similar MOs?

15:08.841 --> 15:10.277
No, so far it's
unique to these guys.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.980
And we should be checking
into armored transport,

15:13.013 --> 15:14.847
and-and jewelry,
fine art, right?

15:14.881 --> 15:16.183
I mean, they could've started

15:16.216 --> 15:18.185
in any one of those
and, uh, moved on to banks.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.521
( sighs ): I should be looking
at mug shots, right?

15:21.554 --> 15:23.056
Did you get a good look?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.557
Yeah, definitely.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.059
WOMAN:
Agent Eppes.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.061
That piece of evidence
you found at the scene--

15:28.095 --> 15:30.330
- we know what it is.
- Excellent.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.099
It's an ultra-thin
plastic mask

15:32.132 --> 15:33.566
that you can peel off

15:33.600 --> 15:35.535
in a second, wad up

15:35.568 --> 15:37.670
- and throw away.
- Right.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.772
A micro-mask.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.074
The CIA uses the stuff

15:41.108 --> 15:42.309
for covert operations.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.278
That explains how he was able
to just disappear.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.015
He could alter the shape
of his face, his nose,

15:48.048 --> 15:49.849
making him unrecognizable.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.518
DON:
So much for mug shots.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.553
I'm gonna find out where
you can get one of these things.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.587
Right. Thanks.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.722
Sure.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.919
Charles?

16:59.952 --> 17:01.988
Charles? Oh.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.323
Listen, I just stopped by.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.825
Amita said that you
weren't gonna be coming

17:05.858 --> 17:07.294
to campus tomorrow, and...

17:07.327 --> 17:09.062
I don't know,
surely you remember

17:09.096 --> 17:11.831
you're giving a presentation to
my graduate seminar.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.700
Larry, I'm right
in the middle

17:13.733 --> 17:15.468
of a significant
line of thought.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.371
Right now really isn't the best
time for me to be entering

17:18.405 --> 17:20.873
in on a discussion with anyone,
no offense.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.742
No, no, no, none taken--
it's just that

17:22.775 --> 17:24.177
Amita said that you also said

17:24.211 --> 17:26.413
that you wouldn't be coming
to school for a while?

17:26.446 --> 17:28.215
And I just think, uh,
you know,

17:28.248 --> 17:29.849
considering
your teaching schedule,

17:29.882 --> 17:34.387
the upcoming semifinals, I mean,
it struck me as rather odd,

17:34.421 --> 17:35.822
just kind of... entirely
unworkable.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.790
Well, maybe so,

17:37.824 --> 17:40.160
but I'm close to a breakthrough
on this three-set,

17:40.193 --> 17:41.394
and so I-I need
to follow through

17:41.428 --> 17:43.196
on this line
of current algorithms now

17:43.230 --> 17:44.464
while I have a fix on it.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.473
- Donny.
- Hey, Dad.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.575
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.409
I'm fine... Ow, ow.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.010
Look,it's just, my arm's
a little sore.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.812
I got a-a scrape
during an incident.

17:59.846 --> 18:00.980
A scrape? From what?

18:01.013 --> 18:02.249
Well, a bullet,
if you have to know.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.917
But it's not... Dad,
please, listen to me, okay?

18:04.951 --> 18:06.753
Just relax.
We had an arrest go bad,

18:06.786 --> 18:08.054
and we lost
an agent, okay?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.389
And three people died.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.458
Now I'm looking for Charlie.
Where is he?

18:11.491 --> 18:13.193
He's out in the
garage with Larry.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.527
He's upset.
I can see why now.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.296
What's he doing
in the garage?

18:16.329 --> 18:18.298
He's just working on
that problem. You know.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.032
What? That problem he can never
solve.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.334
The P versus P thing?

18:21.368 --> 18:22.802
- Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
- Aw, man.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.103
Li... Li... Where you going?

18:24.137 --> 18:25.672
I got to talk to him.
I need a new equation.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.007
Wha...

18:28.040 --> 18:29.709
You know that it's

18:29.742 --> 18:31.178
considered unsolvable?

18:31.211 --> 18:32.912
Well, certainly people
who have failed

18:32.945 --> 18:34.247
to solve it
might think that.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.083
But we all know,
Minesweeper Consistency

18:37.116 --> 18:39.219
is an NP-complete problem,
so I believe

18:39.252 --> 18:41.554
that there is an answer
in here somewhere.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.623
Minesweeper? What are we
talking about, computer games?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.225
Yes, but if you keep
talking to me,

18:45.258 --> 18:46.559
I'm going to lose
my train of thought,

18:46.593 --> 18:49.529
so please don't
talk anymore.

18:49.562 --> 18:53.400
'Cause I-I need to follow
through on this-this-this line

18:53.433 --> 18:55.735
of-of adjacent
vertices.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.069
Look, please don't do this.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.171
Don't do what, Don?

18:58.205 --> 18:59.772
Go ahead, go ahead,
try and tell me

18:59.806 --> 19:00.840
what it is that I'm doing.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.542
You don't even know
what it is I'm doing.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.611
No, actually I do; the thing is,
I don't think you do.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.980
Okay. I'm gonna

19:08.014 --> 19:10.217
go contemplate
the koi pond.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.384
Charlie, look,

19:11.418 --> 19:13.320
you helped us find
these guys once before.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.587
You can do it again.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.289
Come on.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.090
Why, so you can get shot again?

19:18.124 --> 19:19.892
No, buddy.
Look, understand,

19:19.926 --> 19:21.761
I appreciate
you care about me,

19:21.794 --> 19:22.962
but it's not gonna happen.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.431
Statistically,
you're dead now.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.732
You understand
what that means?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.468
A man aimed a gun at
your head and fired.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.238
The fact that you survived
is an anomaly,

19:31.271 --> 19:32.539
and it's unlikely to be
the outcome

19:32.572 --> 19:34.574
- of a second such encounter.
- Listen to me.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.575
We don't have
many leads, okay?

19:35.608 --> 19:37.277
If you can help us
predict when and if

19:37.310 --> 19:38.778
these guys are gonna
hit another bank,

19:38.811 --> 19:39.912
this is the only
shot we got.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.882
Please understand, sometimes...

19:42.915 --> 19:45.585
( panting ):
I can't choose what I work on.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.954
I can't follow through
on a line of thinking

19:47.987 --> 19:49.856
just because I want to or...

19:49.889 --> 19:51.624
or because it's needed.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.294
I have to work
on what's in my head.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.828
And right now

19:55.862 --> 19:59.366
this is what's in my head.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.102
This is the license
we got off the guy

20:03.135 --> 20:04.337
that David shot, which IDs him

20:04.371 --> 20:06.739
as Malcolm Stapleton, right?

20:06.773 --> 20:09.276
All right. This is a duplicate
license

20:09.309 --> 20:10.977
of Stapleton we got
from the DMV.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.745
So...

20:12.779 --> 20:15.648
if the one we got off the body
is a fake, then who is he?

20:15.682 --> 20:18.451
His current neighbors
recognize that guy as Stapleton.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.153
Let's go talk to the neighbors
of his former residence.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.622
- All right, that's a good idea.
- Yeah.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.492
Hey, how's, uh,
how's Charlie doing?

20:25.525 --> 20:27.327
I don't know,
he's just working

20:27.360 --> 20:29.496
on some famously
unsolvable math problem,

20:29.529 --> 20:30.797
which is not a good sign.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.733
At least it's not binge
drinking and strip clubs.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.001
That's true.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.570
TERRY: You're sure this isn't
Malcolm Stapleton?

20:37.604 --> 20:40.307
Yes, I'm sure, because
that's Malcolm's brother.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.141
What happened to him?

20:42.174 --> 20:44.076
He was involved
in an accident.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.845
What's the brother's name?

20:45.878 --> 20:47.514
Bill Stapleton.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.649
He showed up a
few months ago,

20:49.682 --> 20:51.117
said Malcolm had gotten
a job back East

20:51.150 --> 20:52.184
and wouldn't be coming back.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.153
Did Malcolm ever talk
about having a brother,

20:54.186 --> 20:55.588
or say anything
about getting a new job?

20:55.622 --> 20:58.691
No. Never even said good-bye.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.227
Okay, well, thank you
for your time.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.562
Thank you.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.999
Okay, so our dead
guy is the brother

21:07.033 --> 21:08.668
of a man who was
an only child.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.838
- Right.
- Where do you want to start?

21:11.871 --> 21:15.074
I'm thinking if he never said
good-bye, maybe Malcolm

21:15.107 --> 21:16.142
never moved from here.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.544
Let's talk to
the manager.

21:23.149 --> 21:27.086
The super said contractors
came in to do work down here,

21:27.119 --> 21:31.558
but the owner
never ordered the work.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.462
Hey.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.731
Check this out.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.334
( knocking )

21:41.368 --> 21:43.736
Looks brand-new.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.779
That's good. Let me look.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.821
DON:
Whoa.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.624
See that?

22:04.657 --> 22:07.026
TERRY: Looks like we just found
Malcolm.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.930
We found a body identified by
fingerprints

22:10.963 --> 22:12.064
as Malcolm Stapleton.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.299
TERRY:
We think the man you shot

22:13.332 --> 22:15.334
killed Stapleton
and stole his identity.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.403
I'd like to be there

22:16.436 --> 22:17.970
when you talk to the ME.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.606
All right.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.774
Malcolm Stapleton died from

22:21.808 --> 22:23.976
massive blood loss
after his carotid artery

22:24.010 --> 22:24.711
was severed.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.413
The killer knew
what he was doing.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.680
DON:
How so?

22:27.714 --> 22:28.815
Well, the thing is,
most people

22:28.848 --> 22:30.417
don't know how
to slit a throat.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.385
They think you pull back
the head like this.

22:32.419 --> 22:33.453
But in this position,

22:33.486 --> 22:35.021
the windpipe provides
some protection

22:35.054 --> 22:36.355
to the major blood vessels.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.957
However, tilt
the head forward,

22:37.990 --> 22:39.125
the arteries are exposed.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.627
The cut was made away and down

22:40.660 --> 22:43.496
from the assailant,
minimizing blood splatter.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.165
The weapon was
an extremely sharp,

22:46.198 --> 22:47.600
wide-blade knife.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.436
Somebody with medical training?

22:49.469 --> 22:50.903
More like military experience.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.772
You know, the victim in
the robbery or the guy

22:52.805 --> 22:54.541
in the boiler room
had his throat cut

22:54.574 --> 22:56.108
- exactly like this.
- The wound on that body

22:56.142 --> 22:57.276
was very similar.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.878
But here's something new.
Look at this.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.647
Electrical burns.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.082
This man was tortured
before he was killed.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.918
DON:
All right,

23:05.952 --> 23:06.819
so they kill efficiently,

23:06.853 --> 23:08.187
they use torture,
and they can execute

23:08.220 --> 23:11.023
- a coordinated escape.
- You're thinking military?

23:11.057 --> 23:12.959
I'm thinking Special Forces.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.862
( phone rings )

23:15.895 --> 23:17.830
Eppes.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.233
We're on our way.

23:21.267 --> 23:22.569
Charm School Boys
just hit another bank.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.704
Let's go. All right, thanks.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.476
TERRY:
Hey.

23:29.509 --> 23:30.843
Same MO, same two guys.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.512
Asked for cash,
didn't show a weapon,

23:32.545 --> 23:34.447
but when the assistant manager
followed them outside

23:34.481 --> 23:37.183
and pulled out a cell phone,
they shot him.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.551
You realize this breaks
the pattern

23:38.585 --> 23:40.186
of two weeks between robberies.
Excuse me.

23:43.556 --> 23:47.494
( ringing )

23:53.933 --> 23:57.604
Hello.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.872
Uh... yeah,
actually I think

23:59.906 --> 24:01.541
you might have
the right number.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.310
Ma'am, my name is Don Eppes with
the FBI.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.344
There's been
an incident.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.513
Are you at home?

24:06.546 --> 24:08.114
Can you please stay there?

24:08.147 --> 24:09.616
We're going to come see you.

24:09.649 --> 24:12.719
What's your address?

24:19.091 --> 24:20.527
That's my gun.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.594
Classic psych-ops
technique:

24:21.628 --> 24:23.129
he's trying to get
inside your head

24:23.162 --> 24:25.532
so you don't think clearly
and dispassionately.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.534
Well, we need to look beyond
conventional military.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.769
Start concentrating on Delta
Force, Navy SEAL units...

24:29.802 --> 24:30.537
I agree.

24:30.570 --> 24:34.140
Have you shown any
of the new data

24:34.173 --> 24:34.941
to Charlie?

24:34.974 --> 24:36.543
No, he's not
working the case.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.377
Just that crazy math
problem day and night.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.212
Last time he pulled
one of these

24:40.246 --> 24:41.514
is when our mother
got cancer.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.550
They were close?

24:43.583 --> 24:45.685
Yeah, but when
she came home from chemo,

24:45.718 --> 24:48.521
he couldn't deal,
just stayed in the garage...

24:48.555 --> 24:51.390
didn't spend any time with her.

24:51.423 --> 24:52.959
What are you
thinking?

24:52.992 --> 24:54.961
That he can't stay
in the garage forever.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.403
ALAN: You know, Don and Charlie,

25:04.436 --> 25:06.706
they graduated high school
on the same day.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.975
Thank you.
Don's mentioned it.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.810
A few times.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.512
ALAN: Kind of puts an edge on
that sibling rivalry thing,

25:13.546 --> 25:15.582
you know?

25:15.615 --> 25:16.549
I'm sure it does,

25:16.583 --> 25:18.017
but having a kid like Charlie

25:18.050 --> 25:20.352
had to put some unusual
pressure on the family.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.555
How old was he when
you first realized

25:22.589 --> 25:24.356
he was exceptional?

25:24.390 --> 25:26.593
I think he was three

25:26.626 --> 25:29.729
when he multiplied four-digit
numbers in his head.

25:29.762 --> 25:32.264
By the age of four he needed

25:32.298 --> 25:34.967
special teachers,
special classes.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.403
My wife...

25:37.436 --> 25:39.572
I mean, his mother and I,

25:39.606 --> 25:43.676
we put a lot of time
into his education.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.947
It was Don, he was
the one who had to...

25:47.980 --> 25:50.750
get used
to taking care of himself.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.621
Well, he might
have gotten used to it,

25:54.654 --> 25:56.388
but I'm not sure he's as good

25:56.422 --> 25:58.157
at it as he
thinks he is.

25:58.190 --> 26:01.027
Well, it's hard for him
to ask anyone for help.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.496
It's really hard
for him to ask Charlie.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.766
We think they have special
military training,

26:06.799 --> 26:08.635
and now they have
struck again

26:08.668 --> 26:10.870
and killed another
innocent person, Charlie.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.240
Charlie, please don't do this.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.911
Do you understand the stakes
we're dealing with here?

26:18.945 --> 26:20.647
More bloodshed, people's lives.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.114
I mean, if I have to do
this on my own,

26:22.148 --> 26:23.950
it's going to put me
and all of my people

26:23.983 --> 26:25.752
at greater risk;
is that what you want?

26:25.785 --> 26:27.754
Their old pattern's gone.
I told you that.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.221
Then there's got to be
a new pattern.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.723
Doesn't there? Isn't that the
way it works?

26:30.757 --> 26:32.324
You incorporate
whatever's going on?

26:32.358 --> 26:33.660
Ow...

26:33.693 --> 26:36.262
I'm sorry.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.665
I'm sorry.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.903
I need your help,
you understand?

26:43.936 --> 26:48.808
I don't think I can,
that I can...

26:48.841 --> 26:50.777
Charlie, I know it's hard
for you, I understand that,

26:50.810 --> 26:55.014
but it's hard
for everybody.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.451
You know, I don't know
how I got in a situation

26:59.485 --> 27:01.353
where I need your help
to do my job,

27:01.387 --> 27:02.621
but I sure
as hell have.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.023
I wish you would just snap out

27:04.056 --> 27:06.859
of your precious bubble
for once.

27:32.618 --> 27:36.155
Dad... I've been working
on a problem.

27:36.188 --> 27:41.728
P versus NP--
it can't be solved.

27:41.761 --> 27:45.765
I think you knew that
when you started.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.867
I could work on it
forever,

27:47.900 --> 27:52.872
constantly pushing forward,
still never reaching an end.

27:52.905 --> 27:57.877
You know, sometimes
you want to think

27:57.910 --> 28:00.146
that things don't end.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.247
But they do.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.581
When Mom was sick,

28:02.614 --> 28:06.252
I couldn't stop working on it.

28:06.285 --> 28:09.488
Yeah. I know.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.758
I didn't get it.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.760
Uh, not then.

28:13.793 --> 28:17.930
And your brother sure
doesn't understand

28:17.964 --> 28:19.398
why you spent
the last three months

28:19.431 --> 28:21.467
of your mother's life
working on a math problem.

28:23.269 --> 28:27.339
But Charlie, your mother--
she understood why.

28:29.575 --> 28:33.212
Because she knew
how your mind worked.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.554
Malcolm was
a top-level programmer.

28:42.588 --> 28:45.524
He worked in our division
that handles tracking software.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.859
Tracking what?

28:46.893 --> 28:47.860
Financial transactions,

28:47.894 --> 28:49.862
mostly used by banks
for data processing.

28:49.896 --> 28:52.198
What were the circumstances
of his leaving the company?

28:52.231 --> 28:55.134
He was on vacation, called
to say he was quitting.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.302
He had a new job.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.436
All right, thanks.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.105
We'll talk to you soon.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.372
You're welcome.

29:00.406 --> 29:01.673
All right, so Stapleton

29:01.707 --> 29:03.810
had high-level access
to bank software;

29:03.843 --> 29:05.177
he's tortured;
he's murdered,

29:05.211 --> 29:07.980
and his identity is stolen
by a guy who's a member

29:08.014 --> 29:09.715
of a bank robbery crew,
right?

29:09.748 --> 29:10.983
That doesn't seem
like a coincidence.

29:11.017 --> 29:12.651
And consider how
careful they were

29:12.684 --> 29:14.921
to make it seem like
he was still alive.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.923
Right, 'cause you figure
they're going to want

29:16.956 --> 29:18.124
to avoid a murder
investigation

29:18.157 --> 29:19.892
so no one knows they have
access to his work.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.194
Maybe they're using
the software to track

29:22.228 --> 29:24.230
when banks have large
amounts of cash on hand.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.398
Yeah, but the takes
are varied, you know?

29:26.432 --> 29:29.035
I mean, you got a couple
hundred thousand dollars in one,

29:29.068 --> 29:31.971
and then a hundred
dollars in the next.

29:33.639 --> 29:34.974
Don, Captain
Joe MacNevish,

29:35.007 --> 29:36.775
- Delta Forces.
- How are you, sir?

29:36.809 --> 29:38.510
Our John Doe's
fingerprints

29:38.544 --> 29:40.512
turned up a match
with the Army.

29:40.546 --> 29:41.313
Former Delta Force member

29:41.347 --> 29:42.949
Master Sergeant
John Anthony Galbraith.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.716
Galbraith received

29:44.750 --> 29:46.819
an honorable discharge
four years ago.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.254
DAVID:
That's the guy I shot.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.357
One of his associates
was a Robert Gordon Skidmore.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.994
I'm sure the Bureau
has a record on him.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.063
DAVID: Robert Skidmore,
convicted of robbing

29:57.096 --> 29:59.932
a cash shipment coming
into an Army base.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.968
Yeah, that's the guy
who took my gun.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.070
He was partners with
the guy I shot, Galbraith.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.972
All right,
well, we got two names.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.373
Let's start
building a crew chart.

30:07.406 --> 30:08.941
All right.

30:15.214 --> 30:18.951
Well, I was
heartened to hear

30:18.985 --> 30:22.554
that you've shifted your
focus off P versus NP.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.660
So tell me, what is it
that I can help you with?

30:28.694 --> 30:29.996
I failed.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.831
I failed to notice
something significant.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.100
These robberies display

30:34.133 --> 30:36.903
certain highly eccentric
characteristics.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.437
Okay, well how so?

30:38.470 --> 30:40.239
Many were conducted
in under two minutes,

30:40.272 --> 30:41.640
but in many cases,

30:41.673 --> 30:43.175
the perpetrators
remained on the premises

30:43.209 --> 30:45.978
far longer,
despite having the money.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.214
Why would they wait around?

30:48.247 --> 30:49.515
Don't know.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.183
Leaving quickly would seem to be

30:51.217 --> 30:54.053
the essential strategy
when fleeing a felony.

30:54.086 --> 30:57.156
You see this game, Larry?

30:58.590 --> 31:01.160
You've got to clear mines
without blowing any up.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.495
Each time
you've cleared a square,

31:03.529 --> 31:05.898
a numerical value is revealed.

31:05.932 --> 31:07.766
That number tells you exactly
how many squares

31:07.799 --> 31:11.203
containing mines are directly
adjacent to that square.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.771
This allows you to predict

31:12.804 --> 31:15.007
where the next mine
will be located.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.209
And then,
the more boxes revealed,

31:17.243 --> 31:19.211
the more accurately
one can predict

31:19.245 --> 31:21.847
the location of the mines.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.150
The pattern used
in these bank robberies

31:24.183 --> 31:27.586
is similar to this same type
of problem-solving pattern.

31:27.619 --> 31:28.687
These robbers

31:28.720 --> 31:29.922
have used

31:29.956 --> 31:30.990
the banks they've been robbing

31:31.023 --> 31:33.825
to tell them
which ones to rob next.

31:33.859 --> 31:39.031
To what end would criminals be
playing Minesweeper with banks?

31:39.065 --> 31:42.001
I don't know.

31:55.114 --> 31:58.517
DON: Right, no, I don't think
that's smart.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.253
Right.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.322
TERRY:
Don.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.190
Yeah?

32:05.024 --> 32:07.493
I'll call you
right back.

32:07.526 --> 32:08.760
No, I will.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.662
Hey, Charlie.

32:10.696 --> 32:13.132
I have some findings for you.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.601
I'm sorry I couldn't
get to this sooner.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.303
No, now's good.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.170
Come on in.

32:18.204 --> 32:19.671
Did you rework the equation?

32:19.705 --> 32:21.840
No, I think you need
to be looking

32:21.873 --> 32:23.775
at a whole other line
of investigation.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.277
Like what?

32:25.311 --> 32:28.047
What's inside a bank
that's more valuable than money?

32:28.080 --> 32:30.816
Information?
Financial data?

32:30.849 --> 32:32.018
Exactly.

32:32.051 --> 32:35.254
This case--
it isn't about robbing banks.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.997
CHARLIE:
Everything they did

32:45.031 --> 32:47.099
made it seem
like a typical bank robbery,

32:47.133 --> 32:48.634
but while our Charm School Boys

32:48.667 --> 32:51.403
were at the teller's window
creating a diversion,

32:51.437 --> 32:57.243
they must've had a third man
accessing the bank's computers.

32:57.276 --> 33:01.547
The question is, why?

33:01.580 --> 33:04.150
Are we sure this is the only
machine that they messed with?

33:04.183 --> 33:05.151
As far as we know.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.252
Why risk robberies?

33:06.285 --> 33:08.887
Why not just hack
into the bank's computer?

33:08.920 --> 33:09.955
From an outside source,

33:09.988 --> 33:10.989
it's almost impossible.

33:11.023 --> 33:13.192
These databases are guarded
with intense firewalls.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.993
Besides, by actually robbing
the banks,

33:15.027 --> 33:16.195
they were able
to gain any capital

33:16.228 --> 33:17.029
they might need
in the meantime.

33:17.063 --> 33:17.929
More important,

33:17.963 --> 33:19.298
the data seems
to be location-specific.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.067
So when they're accessing data
at one bank,

33:21.100 --> 33:23.069
it leads them to data
at other banks.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.070
Here you go.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.771
It's the YDS software.

33:25.804 --> 33:28.640
The program was accessed
using Stapleton's pass code

33:28.674 --> 33:30.809
on the day of the robbery.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.010
Dollar amounts?

33:32.044 --> 33:33.479
MANAGER:
Believe so.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.280
Bank routing numbers?

33:34.313 --> 33:36.515
MANAGER:
That's what they are.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.716
TERRY: The routing numbers are
all the same.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.985
The cash in this list
is all going to the same bank.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.120
DON:
Which bank?

33:41.153 --> 33:43.955
That's a special Federal Reserve
routing number

33:43.989 --> 33:46.125
for the Federal Reserve Bank
of San Francisco.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.426
Specifically,
the Los Angeles branch.

33:48.627 --> 33:51.130
He helps us on financial cases
all the time.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.698
And I tend to remember numbers.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.068
DON:
So these heists are diversions.

33:56.102 --> 33:56.968
They're distractions.

33:57.002 --> 33:58.003
And that's why Stapleton
was tortured,

33:58.036 --> 33:59.838
for his confidential pass codes.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.641
The exact same computer program
was accessed at all the banks

34:02.674 --> 34:03.509
hit by Skidmore's crew.

34:03.542 --> 34:07.346
How does this factor
into the Federal Reserve?

34:07.379 --> 34:10.149
The program tracks cash
being removed from circulation.

34:10.182 --> 34:11.883
Old currencies,
either worn or ripped,

34:11.917 --> 34:12.684
and it's retired cash

34:12.718 --> 34:14.720
is taken out
of circulation at local banks.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.923
Every few months it's taken
to the Federal Reserve Bank

34:17.956 --> 34:19.791
then to a secret Treasury
location where it's destroyed.

34:19.825 --> 34:23.028
And that retired-cash data
is collated by the YDS software,

34:23.061 --> 34:24.330
which allows the bank robbers

34:24.363 --> 34:26.865
to locate other banks
with the same software.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.134
So once they have enough data,

34:28.167 --> 34:29.635
they get a fix on the shipment

34:29.668 --> 34:32.070
from the Federal Reserve Bank
to the Treasury.

34:32.104 --> 34:34.606
Each shipment is maybe
a hundred million dollars

34:34.640 --> 34:35.974
in untraceable cash.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.277
( phone rings )

34:38.310 --> 34:40.146
Eppes.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.482
Right.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.083
Right, I got it.

34:45.117 --> 34:47.253
That was the Federal Reserve
Bank in Los Angeles.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.155
They got a shipment
of retired currency

34:49.188 --> 34:51.157
going to the Treasury
in six hours, okay?

34:51.190 --> 34:52.591
I want to know
what the security is

34:52.624 --> 34:54.059
what the route is, what the
procedure is, right?

34:54.092 --> 34:56.094
Let's go.

35:09.308 --> 35:10.642
Hey.

35:10.676 --> 35:11.843
Hey.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.212
Just one thing.

35:15.214 --> 35:18.384
Heisenberg
and his Uncertainty Principle.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.852
Right. Do me a favor.
Hold this.

35:20.886 --> 35:21.920
What about it?

35:21.953 --> 35:23.455
Remember
I told you

35:23.489 --> 35:25.924
how the act of observation
will ultimately affect

35:25.957 --> 35:27.058
that which is being observed?

35:27.092 --> 35:29.094
Yes, you did.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.696
These guys know
you've studied them.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.798
They know you're trying
to outthink them.

35:32.831 --> 35:36.568
Charlie, it's all right.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.171
Tell Heisenberg

35:39.205 --> 35:41.407
we're all over this.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.761
We'll be at Ontario Airport

36:35.794 --> 36:37.263
in about 20 minutes.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.304
Almost there.

36:51.843 --> 36:52.578
No!

36:57.015 --> 37:00.452
TERRY:
Unit One, Unit Two, Code Red!

37:00.486 --> 37:01.953
Unit One, Unit Two,
come in!

37:06.124 --> 37:08.294
All right, Unit Two to Unit One,
come in.

37:08.327 --> 37:12.331
( radio static )

37:12.364 --> 37:14.466
Unit Two to Unit One?

37:14.500 --> 37:16.468
TERRY:
Unit One, Unit Two, Code Red.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.474
Unit One to Unit Two, come in.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.644
They're jamming our radios.

37:28.113 --> 37:29.247
( tires screech )

37:31.450 --> 37:33.084
I'm not getting any response.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.321
What do we do?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.824
We'll stick with the plan.

37:40.058 --> 37:40.626
Go.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.071
You want to live?

37:53.104 --> 37:54.306
Drop your guns.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.114
Where's the money?

38:36.147 --> 38:37.416
In the bank.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.820
Drop your weapons!

38:41.853 --> 38:43.455
Get on the ground!

38:51.630 --> 38:52.631
Back off!

39:07.345 --> 39:09.781
Bridge team, green light.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.218
(gunshot)

39:13.251 --> 39:13.985
TERRY:
Drop your weapon!

39:14.019 --> 39:15.421
- Get your ass down!
- Get down on the ground!

39:15.454 --> 39:17.723
- Get down on the ground!
- Get your ass down!

39:17.756 --> 39:19.458
Get your hands
on your head!

39:19.491 --> 39:21.427
Don't move.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.624
( starter grinding )

39:55.827 --> 39:57.062
FBI! Do not move!

39:57.095 --> 39:58.329
Do not move!

39:58.363 --> 40:01.166
Get that other hand
on the wheel right now!

40:01.199 --> 40:01.833
Get it up! Do it!

40:06.271 --> 40:07.506
This is mine.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.174
Get out of the car.

40:09.207 --> 40:11.042
Get out
of the car!

40:12.310 --> 40:13.278
Get down on your face!

40:13.311 --> 40:15.180
Billy, cuff him!

40:23.154 --> 40:24.956
Here you go, Pop.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.291
I got it.

40:26.324 --> 40:27.325
Now you got it.

40:27.358 --> 40:28.627
Thank you.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.195
Spoon.

40:30.228 --> 40:31.830
Hello.
Donnie!

40:34.132 --> 40:35.300
Wow, it's good to see you.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.535
Oh, you guys ate.
I'm starving.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.003
ALAN: There's plenty. Come on.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.037
Yeah?
Did Terry call,

40:39.070 --> 40:40.472
tell you guys what happened?

40:40.506 --> 40:42.741
Yeah, she said you arrested
every suspect.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.510
Only one shot fired, huh?

40:44.543 --> 40:46.344
One? How'd you
pull that off?

40:46.377 --> 40:49.347
We knew roughly where'd they'd
try to hit the next shipment,

40:49.380 --> 40:51.182
and I knew they'd have
an escape plan.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.518
ALAN:
That's very clever.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.319
I guess I was inspired
by Mr. Heisenberg.

40:54.352 --> 40:55.420
just like Charlie here
suggested.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.222
ALAN:
Heisenberg?

40:57.255 --> 40:58.423
You mean, the physicist?

40:58.456 --> 40:59.691
Yeah.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.960
Oh.

41:04.596 --> 41:07.098
Your brother goes into
a dangerous confrontation

41:07.132 --> 41:09.501
with heavily armed felons,
and you prepare him

41:09.535 --> 41:11.269
with a lecture
on the movement

41:11.302 --> 41:12.403
of subatomic particles?

41:12.437 --> 41:13.705
Yep.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.375
It worked, didn't it?

41:17.408 --> 41:18.977
Yes.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.046
I guess it did.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.517
I'm telling you,

41:25.551 --> 41:27.118
if your mother could see you
two guys now,

41:27.152 --> 41:29.054
she would be...

41:29.087 --> 41:30.756
so happy.

41:35.360 --> 41:38.129
How you doing
on your P versus P thing?

41:38.163 --> 41:40.031
NP?

41:40.065 --> 41:41.266
Sorry.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.834
I'm not pursuing it anymore.

41:44.703 --> 41:45.470
No?

41:45.503 --> 41:46.471
I got plenty of problems
to work on,

41:46.504 --> 41:50.542
ones that I think
I can actually solve.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.545
Glad to hear it.

42:06.558 --> 42:07.559
What, no mustard?

42:07.593 --> 42:08.894
I knew you'd ask.

42:08.927 --> 42:10.161
He forgot.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.764
What's up? What's up?
