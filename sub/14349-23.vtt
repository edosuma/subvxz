00:03.140 --> 00:06.758
Captain's log, stardate 3192.1.

00:06.935 --> 00:11.313
The Enterprise is en route
to star cluster NGC 321.

00:11.482 --> 00:13.854
Objective:
To open diplomatic relations

00:14.026 --> 00:16.731
with the civilizations
known to be there.

00:16.904 --> 00:18.861
We have sent a message
to Eminiar Vll,

00:19.031 --> 00:21.154
principal planet of the star cluster,

00:21.325 --> 00:24.077
informing them of
our friendly intentions.

00:24.245 --> 00:25.787
We are awaiting an answer.

00:25.955 --> 00:27.153
Nothing yet, lieutenant?

00:27.332 --> 00:30.452
Nothing, captain.
Hailing frequencies are open.

00:38.343 --> 00:40.550
Have you received an answer
to your message yet, captain?

00:40.721 --> 00:43.212
Nothing yet, ambassador.
We're awaiting a reply.

00:43.390 --> 00:46.391
Today is the first time we've had any
evidence they've picked up our signal.

00:46.685 --> 00:50.469
Captain, message coming in
from Eminiar Vll.

00:51.690 --> 00:54.645
- Sir, it's code 710.
- Are you sure?

00:54.819 --> 00:57.108
Positive.
It repeats over and over again.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.691
Is that supposed
to mean something?

00:58.865 --> 01:00.608
Code 710 means
under no circumstances

01:00.783 --> 01:04.483
are we to approach that planet.
No circumstances whatsoever.

01:04.662 --> 01:07.332
You will disregard that signal, captain.

01:07.499 --> 01:10.868
- Mr. Fox, it is their planet.
- Captain, in the past 20 years

01:11.044 --> 01:13.500
thousands of lives have
been lost on this quadrant,

01:13.672 --> 01:16.708
lives that could have been saved if
the Federation had a treaty port here.

01:17.634 --> 01:20.505
We mean to have that port,
and I'm here to get it.

01:20.679 --> 01:23.597
By disregarding code 710,
you might well involve us

01:23.766 --> 01:25.343
in an interplanetary war.

01:25.518 --> 01:28.353
- I'm quite prepared to take that risk.
- You are?

01:29.605 --> 01:33.105
I'm thinking about this ship,
my crew.

01:33.276 --> 01:36.360
I have my orders, captain,
and now you have yours.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.320
You will proceed on course,

01:38.489 --> 01:40.815
achieve orbit status
and just leave the rest to me.

01:41.409 --> 01:45.027
You're well aware that my mission
gives me the power of command.

01:45.246 --> 01:46.871
I now exercise it.

01:47.040 --> 01:51.168
You will proceed on course.
That's a direct order.

01:59.136 --> 02:01.045
In view of code 710, captain,
may I suggest?

02:01.222 --> 02:02.550
Yes, Mr. Spock.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.930
This is the captain.
Condition, yellow alert.

02:05.101 --> 02:08.018
Phaser crews, stand by.
Deflector shields up.

02:08.187 --> 02:09.431
We're going in, gentlemen.

02:09.604 --> 02:13.105
Peacefully, I hope,
but peacefully or not...

02:13.484 --> 02:15.192
...we're going in.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.287 --> 02:27.621
Space, the final frontier.

02:28.542 --> 02:32.125
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:32.296 --> 02:36.958
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:37.134 --> 02:40.052
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:41.347 --> 02:44.467
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:16.509 --> 03:20.008
Captain's log, stardate 3192.5.

03:20.179 --> 03:23.548
Now in standard orbit
around planet Eminiar Vll.

03:23.724 --> 03:25.100
My orders are clear.

03:25.268 --> 03:29.479
We must establish
diplomatic relations at all cost.

03:29.647 --> 03:31.973
Preparing to beam down
to planet's surface.

03:32.150 --> 03:35.400
We know very little about them.
Their civilisation is advanced.

03:35.570 --> 03:38.108
They've had space flight
for several centuries,

03:38.281 --> 03:40.903
but they've never ventured
beyond their own solar system.

03:41.076 --> 03:43.614
When first contacted
more than 50 years ago,

03:43.787 --> 03:47.370
Eminiar Vll was at war
with its nearest neighbour.

03:47.541 --> 03:49.035
Anything else?

03:49.376 --> 03:54.751
The Earth expedition making the report
failed to return from its mission.

03:55.132 --> 03:58.383
The USS Valiant.

04:01.055 --> 04:03.262
Listed as missing in space.

04:03.433 --> 04:04.975
Kirk, what's this about
you going alone?

04:05.143 --> 04:08.097
Not alone, Mr. Ambassador. I'm taking
some security people with me.

04:08.271 --> 04:10.762
- It is my prerogative...
- I can't risk beaming you down there

04:10.940 --> 04:13.479
until I know what kind of reception
you're going to receive.

04:13.652 --> 04:16.817
Your safety is my responsibility.
Those are my orders, sir.

04:16.988 --> 04:19.314
- Mr. Spock.
- Transporter Room standing by.

04:19.491 --> 04:21.697
- What coordinates?
- We have selected a site which,

04:21.869 --> 04:24.704
from the traffic, would seem
to be near an official establishment.

04:24.872 --> 04:28.407
- Final sensor readings?
- No hostility directed toward us.

04:28.584 --> 04:31.502
No apparent notice taken of us at all,
which seems strange.

04:31.879 --> 04:36.209
They did scan us when we assumed
orbit. Obviously, they know we're here.

04:36.384 --> 04:37.582
Ship's defences?

04:37.760 --> 04:42.422
Screens down, but all defensive details
on general alert status, captain.

04:42.599 --> 04:44.176
Good.

04:44.976 --> 04:47.432
Landing party will pick up phaser
number ones from the arsenal.

04:47.604 --> 04:49.846
- Keep them inconspicuous. Mr. Scott?
- Yes, sir?

04:50.106 --> 04:53.024
The ship is yours.
Take care of her until I come back.

04:53.193 --> 04:57.191
Aye, aye, sir. And have a bonny trip.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.986
We'll do our best. Let's go.

05:22.015 --> 05:24.221
They will materialise there.

05:24.809 --> 05:29.306
Remember your instructions. They are
to be treated correctly, nothing more.

05:56.593 --> 05:59.344
I'm Captain James T. Kirk
of the starship Enterprise,

05:59.512 --> 06:02.003
representing the
United Federation of Planets.

06:02.182 --> 06:04.673
I know. I am Mea 3.

06:04.851 --> 06:07.259
I congratulate you on
your instrumentation.

06:07.437 --> 06:09.596
You've come directly
to the Division of Control.

06:09.773 --> 06:11.682
If you'll follow me, please.

06:18.824 --> 06:21.778
- Captain, I wish...
- Yes?

06:22.203 --> 06:25.370
- You were warned not to come here.
- I had orders to come here.

06:26.624 --> 06:28.866
Why did your people tell us
to stay away?

06:29.043 --> 06:32.459
- It was for your own safety, captain.
- I see no danger here.

06:32.630 --> 06:34.623
The danger exists.

06:35.592 --> 06:37.216
Nevertheless, you are here.

06:37.385 --> 06:40.885
It would be morally incorrect to do less
than extend our hospitality.

06:41.181 --> 06:43.802
Anan 7 and members
of the High Council await you.

06:43.975 --> 06:46.134
If you will come this way, please.

07:11.588 --> 07:15.751
I'm Captain Kirk.
This is my first officer, Mr. Spock.

07:16.426 --> 07:20.424
Lieutenants Galloway,
Osborne, Yeoman Tamura.

07:20.597 --> 07:22.424
Welcome to Eminiar Vll.

07:27.604 --> 07:29.977
Well, captain,
what can we do for you?

07:30.441 --> 07:32.932
My mission is to establish
diplomatic relations

07:33.110 --> 07:34.937
between your people and mine.

07:35.112 --> 07:37.022
That is impossible.

07:37.448 --> 07:40.864
- Would you mind telling me why?
- Because of the war.

07:41.619 --> 07:42.817
You're still at war?

07:43.538 --> 07:48.117
We have been at war for 500 years.

07:48.626 --> 07:51.830
You conceal it very well. Mr. Spock?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.710
Sir, we have completely
scanned your planet.

07:54.883 --> 07:58.797
We find it highly advanced,
prosperous in a material sense,

07:58.971 --> 08:03.965
comfortable for your people
and peaceful in the extreme.

08:04.143 --> 08:08.010
Yet you say you are at war.
There is no evidence of this.

08:08.898 --> 08:11.649
Casualties among
our civilian population

08:11.817 --> 08:17.820
total from 1 to 3 million dead
each year from direct enemy attack.

08:17.990 --> 08:21.407
That is one reason, captain,
why we told you to stay away.

08:22.495 --> 08:26.363
As long as your ship is orbiting
our planet, it is in severe danger.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.162
With whom are you at war?

08:29.461 --> 08:32.711
The third planet in our system,
called Vendikar.

08:32.881 --> 08:36.167
Originally settled by our people
and now a ruthless enemy.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.587
Highly advanced technologically.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.178
Please excuse me.

08:45.352 --> 08:46.597
Vendikar is attacking.

08:48.022 --> 08:50.015
Mea, care for our guests.

08:53.319 --> 08:55.359
- Strange.
- To say the least.

08:55.530 --> 08:58.484
- It will not last long.
- Don't you take shelter?

08:58.867 --> 09:01.737
- There is no shelter, captain.
- Are these attacks frequent?

09:02.037 --> 09:05.203
Oh, yes.
And we will retaliate immediately.

09:11.254 --> 09:12.500
What is it?

09:12.673 --> 09:14.749
A hit, right here in the city.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.253
Do you hear any explosions,
Mr. Spock?

09:22.433 --> 09:24.390
None, captain.
Yeoman Tamura?

09:24.560 --> 09:26.387
- Sir?
- Tricorder readings.

09:26.562 --> 09:28.306
Radiation disturbances of any kind.

09:32.276 --> 09:34.565
Nothing, sir. No evidence.

09:37.615 --> 09:41.448
Mea, if this is an attack,

09:42.204 --> 09:44.659
may I ask what weapons
the enemy is using?

09:45.082 --> 09:48.914
Fusion bombs, materialised
by the enemy over their targets.

09:52.423 --> 09:55.092
- Kirk to bridge. Scotty?
- Scott here, captain.

09:55.384 --> 09:57.258
Scanners operative
on the planet surface?

09:57.428 --> 09:59.586
Of course, sir. As per orders.

09:59.764 --> 10:01.887
Anything unusual?

10:02.058 --> 10:04.631
Nothing, sir. All quiet.

10:07.772 --> 10:09.599
Thank you. Kirk out.

10:11.192 --> 10:12.437
Look, Anan.

10:12.610 --> 10:15.979
Yes, I see it. They were warned.

10:16.239 --> 10:18.777
Just as it happened 50 years ago.

10:18.950 --> 10:23.162
Alert a security detachment.
They may be needed.

10:31.630 --> 10:35.165
It was a vicious attack,
extremely destructive.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.626
Fortunately,
our defences are firming.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.294
But our casualties are high,
very high.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.723
Sir, I have been in contact
with my ship,

10:44.477 --> 10:47.811
which has had this entire planet
under surveillance.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.854
All during this...

10:50.024 --> 10:54.236
...so-called attack of yours,
we have been monitoring you.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.316
There's been no attack,
no explosions, no radiations,

10:57.491 --> 10:59.567
no disturbances whatsoever.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.486
If this is some sort of game
you're playing...

11:01.662 --> 11:03.322
This is no game, captain.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.500
Half a million people
have just been killed.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.205
- Activate the attack units, Sar.
- Yes, councilman.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.667
Launch immediate counterattack.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.333
Computers, captain.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.715
They fight their war with computers,
totally.

11:16.886 --> 11:19.009
Yes, of course.

11:21.516 --> 11:24.600
Computers don't kill
a half a million people.

11:24.769 --> 11:27.972
Deaths have been registered. Of
course, they have 24 hours to report.

11:28.148 --> 11:31.896
- To report?
- To our disintegration machines.

11:32.944 --> 11:34.818
You must understand, captain,

11:35.030 --> 11:38.862
we have been at war for 500 years.

11:39.034 --> 11:43.198
Under ordinary conditions,
no civilisation could withstand that.

11:43.372 --> 11:44.783
But we have reached a solution.

11:44.957 --> 11:47.530
Then the attack by Vendikar
was theoretical?

11:47.710 --> 11:50.082
Oh, no. Quite real.

11:50.254 --> 11:52.413
An attack is mathematically launched.

11:54.050 --> 11:56.802
I lost my wife in the last attack.

11:57.136 --> 12:00.054
Our civilisation lives.

12:00.223 --> 12:04.055
The people die,
but our culture goes on.

12:09.691 --> 12:11.648
You mean to tell me...

12:12.486 --> 12:16.566
...your people just walk
into a disintegration machine

12:16.740 --> 12:17.938
when they're told to?

12:18.242 --> 12:21.077
We have a high consciousness
of duty, captain.

12:21.245 --> 12:23.403
There is a certain
scientific logic about it.

12:23.581 --> 12:24.909
I'm glad you approve.

12:25.541 --> 12:27.913
I do not approve.

12:28.085 --> 12:31.086
- I understand.
- Good.

12:31.589 --> 12:34.258
Then you will recall
I warned you not to come here.

12:35.009 --> 12:37.251
You chose to ignore my warning.

12:37.428 --> 12:40.180
I'm sorry, but it's happened.

12:40.348 --> 12:43.468
- What has happened?
- Once your ship was in orbit

12:44.019 --> 12:46.806
about our planet,
it became a legitimate target.

12:46.980 --> 12:51.274
It has been classified destroyed
by a tricobalt satellite explosion.

12:56.365 --> 12:59.117
All persons aboard your ship
have 24 hours

12:59.285 --> 13:02.286
to report
to our disintegration machines.

13:02.538 --> 13:05.658
In order to ensure their cooperation,
I have ordered you, captain,

13:05.833 --> 13:09.534
and your party held in custody
until they surrender.

13:15.677 --> 13:18.132
If possible, we shall spare your ship,
captain.

13:18.304 --> 13:21.389
But its passengers and crew
are already dead.

13:31.902 --> 13:34.737
Captain's log, delayed.

13:34.905 --> 13:37.657
The Enterprise, in orbit
about Eminiar Vll,

13:37.825 --> 13:39.699
has been declared a casualty

13:39.869 --> 13:43.154
of an incredible war
fought by computers.

13:43.331 --> 13:45.656
I and my landing party,
though apparently not included

13:45.833 --> 13:48.159
as casualties aboard the Enterprise,

13:48.336 --> 13:51.752
are confined on the planet's surface,

13:51.923 --> 13:55.292
awaiting what?

13:59.014 --> 14:01.137
I have been sent to ask
if you require anything.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.888
We require a great deal.
I wish to speak to Anan 7.

14:05.687 --> 14:07.395
He is busy coordinating
casualty lists.

14:07.564 --> 14:09.937
He'll have more casualty lists
than he knows what to do with

14:10.109 --> 14:11.733
if he doesn't get in here
and talk to me.

14:11.902 --> 14:13.729
Don't you understand?
Our duty now...

14:13.904 --> 14:19.528
Your duty doesn't include stepping into
a disintegrator and disappearing.

14:20.244 --> 14:21.952
I'm afraid mine does, captain.

14:22.121 --> 14:24.114
I, too, have been declared
a casualty.

14:24.415 --> 14:26.989
I must report to a disintegrator
by noon tomorrow.

14:28.086 --> 14:30.659
Is that all it means to you?

14:30.922 --> 14:32.666
To report and die?

14:32.841 --> 14:35.842
My life is as dear to me
as yours is to you, captain.

14:36.011 --> 14:38.383
- But how can you stand?
- Don't you see?

14:38.805 --> 14:42.257
If I refuse to report,
and others refuse,

14:42.434 --> 14:45.637
then Vendikar would have no choice
but to launch real weapons.

14:46.313 --> 14:49.647
We would have to do the same
to defend ourselves.

14:49.817 --> 14:51.940
More than people would die then.

14:52.111 --> 14:54.898
A whole civilisation
would be destroyed.

14:55.072 --> 14:57.824
Surely, you can see that
ours is the better way.

14:58.659 --> 15:01.660
No. I don't see that at all.

15:01.954 --> 15:04.742
It's been our way
for almost 500 years.

15:13.633 --> 15:14.962
Is there anything I can bring you?

15:15.135 --> 15:17.887
Yes. Anan 7.

15:35.865 --> 15:38.154
I tell you, we should've heard
something by now.

15:38.326 --> 15:41.113
Aye, doctor, that we should.
But we haven't.

15:41.371 --> 15:43.577
And we cannot raise them.

15:44.165 --> 15:46.573
Now, if there'd been trouble,
they should've at least managed

15:46.751 --> 15:49.373
- to get word back to us.
- Well, we can't just sit here.

15:49.546 --> 15:51.373
What would you suggest?

15:51.548 --> 15:54.170
Me? I'm a doctor.
If I were an officer of the line, I...

15:54.343 --> 15:57.178
- Would you have me open fire?
- Of course not.

15:57.554 --> 16:00.674
Mr. Scott, message coming in
from the captain.

16:00.849 --> 16:03.138
- Scott here, captain.
- Good news, Mr. Scott.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.102
The Eminians have agreed
to the establishment

16:05.271 --> 16:07.014
of full, normal, diplomatic relations.

16:07.273 --> 16:09.230
Mr. Fox will be glad
to hear about that.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.559
They've also extended an invitation
to all personnel

16:11.736 --> 16:13.479
to come ashore for shore leave.

16:13.654 --> 16:16.609
They've assured me that our people
will have a wonderful time.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.403
- Captain?
- Yes, Mr. Scott.

16:20.578 --> 16:22.701
- All personnel?
- All personnel.

16:22.872 --> 16:27.001
We'll transport up trained Eminians
to assume support positions.

16:28.670 --> 16:31.292
Those are my orders, Mr. Scott.

16:32.049 --> 16:33.709
Aye, aye, captain.

16:33.884 --> 16:36.968
I'll start forming shore parties
immediately. Scott out.

16:38.722 --> 16:40.964
Well, now, what do you
think of that?

16:43.144 --> 16:44.389
I don't know.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.562
Well, I do.

16:49.901 --> 16:54.479
Computer, last message received
and recorded from Captain Kirk.

16:56.741 --> 16:58.022
In place.

16:58.201 --> 17:02.697
Run it through analyser. Question:
Is it or is it not the captain's voice?

17:05.041 --> 17:07.746
Negative. A close copy.

17:07.920 --> 17:12.166
- A voice duplicator?
- Ninety-eight percent probability.

17:14.676 --> 17:18.757
Well, they've got them, doctor.
And now they're trying to get us.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.512
Are you sure you can do it,
Mr. Spock?

17:21.684 --> 17:25.385
Limited telepathic abilities
are inherent in Vulcanians, captain.

17:25.563 --> 17:28.434
It may work, it may not.

17:29.150 --> 17:30.775
Do your best.

18:36.512 --> 18:38.006
- Thank you, Mr. Spock.
- My pleasure.

18:38.181 --> 18:39.379
What do we do now, captain?

18:39.557 --> 18:42.226
We get our communicators back
and try and contact the ship.

18:42.393 --> 18:46.937
Mr. Spock,
we'll need more weapons.

18:47.190 --> 18:48.435
I understand.

18:48.733 --> 18:51.355
We'll try to take it easy,
but if we're forced to kill...

20:00.725 --> 20:04.141
An entrance, captain, but no exit.

20:04.312 --> 20:06.471
They go in,
but they do not come out.

20:06.648 --> 20:09.056
- A disintegration machine.
- So I would assume.

20:18.535 --> 20:19.864
Mea.

20:20.621 --> 20:22.115
What do you think you're doing?

20:22.289 --> 20:24.282
- I'm... I'm going...
- You're not going in there.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.036
- But I must.
- No, you're not.

20:26.210 --> 20:29.045
Please. It's all right.
Don't worry about me.

20:29.213 --> 20:30.624
Mr. Spock, that guard.

20:34.052 --> 20:35.676
I'll cover you.

20:45.105 --> 20:49.482
Sir, there's a multi-legged creature
crawling on your shoulder.

21:08.588 --> 21:11.423
All right, you people,
clear out of the way.

21:17.013 --> 21:18.591
Oh, what are you doing?

21:18.765 --> 21:21.007
Throwing a monkey wrench
into the machinery.

21:21.184 --> 21:23.592
- You can't do this!
- I've done it.

21:28.859 --> 21:30.686
Come on, let's get out of here.

21:31.695 --> 21:35.029
The Federation prisoners have
attacked their guard and escaped.

21:35.199 --> 21:36.527
They are armed.

21:36.701 --> 21:39.702
Disintegration station number 12
destroyed, councilman.

21:39.871 --> 21:41.994
Apparently by disrupter fire.

21:44.584 --> 21:49.211
All security personnel,
Federation prisoners have escaped.

21:49.380 --> 21:52.382
They are to be found.
They are armed.

21:52.550 --> 21:55.042
If they resist, do what is necessary.

21:57.723 --> 22:00.095
Planetary disrupter banks,

22:00.350 --> 22:03.802
calculate orbit of star cruiser
now circling.

22:03.979 --> 22:05.888
Stand by to fire, full power.

22:07.900 --> 22:11.234
Councilman, planetary disrupter
banks locked onto target.

22:11.404 --> 22:13.396
Standing by.

22:13.906 --> 22:16.148
In ten seconds, open fire.

22:17.285 --> 22:20.036
Destroy the star cruiser.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.750
Those are the orders
of the Council.

22:29.673 --> 22:32.709
Ship's log, stardate 3193.0.

22:32.884 --> 22:34.758
Chief Engineer Scott recording.

22:34.928 --> 22:37.217
The captain and first officer
are overdue and missing

22:37.389 --> 22:39.797
on the surface of Eminiar Vll.

22:39.975 --> 22:41.849
I have taken standard
precautionary measures

22:42.019 --> 22:44.177
while we continue
our attempts to locate them.

22:44.355 --> 22:48.684
All stations reporting.
Deflector screens rigged at full power.

22:48.859 --> 22:52.560
Phaser crews ready.
Sensors reading zero.

22:52.738 --> 22:55.609
- Correction. Mr. Scott?
- Yes, Mr. DePaul.

22:55.783 --> 22:58.619
Sensor readings just
shot off the scale.

23:06.169 --> 23:09.040
Oh, no.
They're taking potshots at us.

23:10.674 --> 23:14.090
- Holding, Mr. DePaul?
- Screens firm, sir.

23:14.344 --> 23:19.339
Extremely powerful sonic vibrations,
decibels 18 to the 12th power.

23:20.726 --> 23:23.680
If those screens weren't up,
we'd be totally disrupted by now.

23:23.854 --> 23:26.559
Well, I guess that answers
our questions, Mr. Scott.

23:27.191 --> 23:30.691
- They're not very friendly, are they?
- Aye.

23:30.862 --> 23:34.729
But what about our captain and the
landing party down there somewhere?

23:35.033 --> 23:36.408
We get them out.

23:36.743 --> 23:41.903
If they're alive and if we can
find them. That's a big planet.

23:42.082 --> 23:44.787
Not too big for the Enterprise
to handle, if it has to.

23:45.001 --> 23:47.327
We can't fire full phasers
with our screens up.

23:47.671 --> 23:50.043
And we can't lower our screens
with their disrupters on us.

23:50.966 --> 23:54.549
Of course, I could treat them
to a few dozen photon torpedoes.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.463
You'll do no such thing, Mr. Scott.

23:56.639 --> 23:59.509
Mr. Fox, we're under attack.
They're trying to knock us down.

23:59.683 --> 24:01.925
- You have taken defensive measures.
- Of course, but...

24:02.103 --> 24:03.680
"But." There are no "buts."

24:03.854 --> 24:05.646
Obviously, it's a misunderstanding,

24:05.815 --> 24:08.353
and one of my jobs is to clear
up misunderstandings.

24:08.526 --> 24:11.361
- They're holding our captain.
- We have no proof of that.

24:11.529 --> 24:13.937
I'm responsible
for the safety of this ship.

24:14.115 --> 24:16.404
And I'm responsible
for the success of this mission.

24:16.576 --> 24:19.328
And that's more important
than this ship. Is that clear?

24:19.496 --> 24:21.951
We came here to establish
diplomatic relations with these people.

24:22.124 --> 24:24.282
But they're the ones
looking for a fight, Mr. Fox.

24:24.459 --> 24:26.167
This is a diplomatic matter.

24:26.336 --> 24:30.630
If you'll check your regulations,
you'll find that my orders get priority.

24:30.799 --> 24:33.207
I'll try to make contact
with the planetary officials.

24:33.385 --> 24:35.876
Lieutenant, open up a channel
and keep it open.

24:36.055 --> 24:38.462
Tell them to expect
a priority-one message from me.

24:40.184 --> 24:44.597
There will be no punitive measures,
gentlemen. Those are my orders.

24:49.277 --> 24:51.186
Diplomats.

24:51.362 --> 24:55.277
The best diplomat I know
is a fully activated phaser bank.

24:59.079 --> 25:01.617
- Why did we come back here?
- The last place they'll look for us

25:01.790 --> 25:03.533
is the place we escaped from.
Cover the door.

25:03.709 --> 25:06.330
Captain, you have got to let me go.
My time is almost up.

25:06.503 --> 25:09.041
- Are you that anxious to die?
- You don't understand.

25:09.214 --> 25:10.922
Mr. Spock,
how did that little raid work out?

25:11.091 --> 25:13.250
We captured four of
their disrupter-type weapons,

25:13.427 --> 25:17.342
two complete outfits of male clothing
and perhaps, most important of all,

25:17.515 --> 25:19.721
one of their communication devices.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.885
- Will it reach the ship?
- Not at this time.

25:22.061 --> 25:24.054
Its range is restricted
in comparison with ours.

25:24.230 --> 25:26.686
I may be able to alter its components,
but it will take time.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.981
Get to work on it.
We've got to contact the ship.

25:29.152 --> 25:32.984
Mea, I want you to give me a complete
layout of this building complex.

25:33.156 --> 25:35.065
- How do I get to the War Room?
- No!

25:35.242 --> 25:36.985
Now, listen to me.

25:37.494 --> 25:42.073
I'm trying to help you, to save your life
and the lives of millions like you.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.824
If you help me, maybe I can do it.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.745
If you don't, you'll die.

25:46.921 --> 25:50.870
We'll die, and the killing will go on.
Or are you that fond of the war?

25:53.135 --> 25:54.594
What are you going to do?

25:54.887 --> 25:58.054
We're going to try
and stop the killing.

25:59.851 --> 26:02.887
We'll try to help. Believe me.

26:06.858 --> 26:10.025
I believe you. But...

26:10.195 --> 26:11.938
Tell me what I want to know.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.860
Please.

26:18.036 --> 26:20.076
Time is running out.

26:20.372 --> 26:23.741
We have been unable
to destroy the Earth ship.

26:23.918 --> 26:27.121
One of our disintegration
chambers has been eliminated,

26:27.296 --> 26:30.879
and we have already fallen
far behind in our quota.

26:31.050 --> 26:35.842
This is a grave crisis, and I am
at a loss to know how to proceed.

26:36.014 --> 26:38.302
The central channel, Anan.

26:38.474 --> 26:41.641
The Earth ambassador is calling
with an urgent message.

26:43.355 --> 26:45.394
What is the greater morality,

26:45.815 --> 26:51.023
open honesty or a deception
which may save our lives?

26:53.657 --> 26:55.946
Put me through to
the Earth ambassador.

27:00.164 --> 27:02.240
A channel is open, Mr. Ambassador.

27:02.416 --> 27:04.290
You will be speaking to Anan 7,

27:04.585 --> 27:07.835
head of the High Council
of the Eminian Union.

27:10.508 --> 27:12.335
Mr. Anan, this is Robert Fox,

27:12.510 --> 27:16.009
Special ambassador for
the United Federation of Planets.

27:16.181 --> 27:18.007
A great honour, Mr. Ambassador.

27:18.183 --> 27:20.175
We have approached you openly,

27:20.352 --> 27:23.555
with the intent of establishing
formal and friendly relations

27:23.730 --> 27:26.517
between our peoples. But now,

27:26.691 --> 27:30.772
for some reason, you
have attacked us, and apparently,

27:30.946 --> 27:34.280
you're holding several special
representatives of our Federation.

27:34.450 --> 27:37.534
A mistake, Mr. Ambassador.
We are at war.

27:38.037 --> 27:42.117
An error in our sensors indicated
that your ship was about to attack us.

27:42.291 --> 27:44.533
I'm giving orders that
our attack be stopped.

27:44.710 --> 27:47.201
Now, as to your representatives,

27:47.380 --> 27:51.508
you have my sacred word as an
Eminian that they are alive and well.

27:51.926 --> 27:53.551
Thank you.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.721
I thought perhaps it was all
a mistake.

27:57.098 --> 28:00.467
Mr. Scott, disrupter beams
are no longer hitting us.

28:00.727 --> 28:02.969
Maintain status, Mr. DePaul.

28:04.314 --> 28:07.849
We are most anxious to establish
relations with you, Mr. Fox.

28:08.026 --> 28:10.482
We will make arrangements
to receive you.

28:11.822 --> 28:13.898
The minute their screens are down,
open fire.

28:14.074 --> 28:15.403
Yes, councilman.

28:16.243 --> 28:19.695
I apologise deeply
for the misunderstanding.

28:19.872 --> 28:22.410
These are trying times for us,
you understand.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.624
I understand.

28:24.794 --> 28:26.169
Mr. Anan, I presume that

28:26.337 --> 28:29.587
you'll have our ship's captain
on hand when I beam down.

28:29.924 --> 28:32.712
He will be there, sir.
I give you my word.

28:32.927 --> 28:34.386
I'm sure that, from this day forward,

28:34.554 --> 28:38.006
your planet and our Federation
will attain the deepest friendship.

28:38.183 --> 28:40.223
I look forward to seeing you.

28:42.980 --> 28:48.057
Diplomacy, gentlemen,
should be a job left to diplomats.

28:48.277 --> 28:51.610
You will, of course, immediately
resume a peaceful status.

28:51.780 --> 28:54.272
No, sir. I will not.

28:54.575 --> 28:55.773
What did you say?

28:55.951 --> 28:59.036
I'll not lower the screens.
Not until the captain tells me to.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.783
You are taking orders from me.

29:01.457 --> 29:04.245
You will lower the screens
as a sign of good faith.

29:04.419 --> 29:06.957
- My authority...
- I know about your authority,

29:07.130 --> 29:08.921
but the screens stay up.

29:10.258 --> 29:12.963
Mr. Fox, they faked a message
from the captain,

29:13.136 --> 29:15.045
they've launched an attack
against our ship.

29:15.222 --> 29:16.882
Now you want us
to trust them openly?

29:17.057 --> 29:20.141
I want you and expect you
to obey my lawful orders.

29:20.310 --> 29:22.718
No, sir. I won't lower the screens.

29:22.896 --> 29:25.185
Your refusal to comply with my orders

29:25.357 --> 29:27.813
has endangered the entire
success of this mission!

29:27.985 --> 29:30.108
I can have you sent
to a penal colony for this.

29:30.279 --> 29:33.316
That you can, sir,
but I won't lower the screens.

29:33.574 --> 29:37.275
Your name will figure prominently in
my report to the Federation Central.

29:46.755 --> 29:49.162
Well, Scotty, now you've done it.

29:49.341 --> 29:53.291
Aye. The haggis is in the fire for sure,
but I'll not lower my defences

29:53.470 --> 29:56.804
on the word of that mealy-mouthed
gentleman down below.

29:56.974 --> 29:59.844
Not until I know what happened
to the captain.

30:12.198 --> 30:14.867
Won't you join me in a drink,
captain?

30:15.702 --> 30:18.537
You'll find our trova most interesting.

30:19.289 --> 30:21.032
I didn't come to drink.

30:22.542 --> 30:23.871
I assume that is what you used

30:24.044 --> 30:26.879
to destroy disintegration chamber
number 12.

30:27.047 --> 30:29.336
A very efficient weapon.
I'm not afraid of using it.

30:29.508 --> 30:32.213
My first impression was correct.

30:34.429 --> 30:36.387
You are a barbarian.

30:38.058 --> 30:39.968
I am?

30:41.395 --> 30:43.684
Don't sound so incredulous, captain.

30:43.856 --> 30:46.062
Of course you are. We all are.

30:46.233 --> 30:48.985
A killer first, a builder second.

30:49.153 --> 30:53.400
A hunter, a warrior and,
let's be honest, a murderer.

30:53.574 --> 30:55.816
That is our joint heritage, is it not?

30:55.994 --> 30:59.030
We're a little less cold-blooded
about it than you are.

31:00.290 --> 31:01.570
What do you want, captain?

31:04.920 --> 31:07.126
I want to contact my ship.

31:10.425 --> 31:12.502
Where are my communicators?

31:13.387 --> 31:14.585
In a safe place.

31:14.930 --> 31:17.421
You take a lot of chances,
councilman.

31:17.892 --> 31:22.103
You're worried about your ship,
captain. I'm trying to save a world.

31:22.939 --> 31:25.180
If I were you,

31:25.358 --> 31:28.027
I'd think about saving my life.

31:30.363 --> 31:32.521
Won't you have a drink, captain?

31:52.052 --> 31:55.219
And then we can discuss
our differences.

31:56.474 --> 31:59.391
I'm not interested in
discussing our differences.

31:59.602 --> 32:01.641
You don't seem to realise
the risk you're taking.

32:01.812 --> 32:04.019
We don't make war with computers

32:04.190 --> 32:09.018
and herd the casualties
into suicide stations.

32:09.195 --> 32:12.979
We make the real thing,
councilman.

32:13.325 --> 32:15.234
I could destroy this planet.

32:15.785 --> 32:18.158
Why do you think
I don't let you talk to your ship?

32:18.455 --> 32:21.160
I don't need the ship for that.

32:21.792 --> 32:27.665
You mean, all by yourself with a
disrupter, you can destroy this planet?

32:28.007 --> 32:29.916
That's exactly what I mean.

32:30.092 --> 32:34.588
- I had no idea you were so formidable.
- You seem to think I'm joking.

32:35.222 --> 32:37.215
Where are the communicators?

32:42.563 --> 32:47.190
If I told you, captain, would you
walk right out and get them?

32:48.361 --> 32:49.690
Something like that.

32:50.030 --> 32:53.233
Very well, captain.
They're in the War Room.

32:53.408 --> 32:58.319
Go left, down the corridor, left again.
They are unguarded.

33:36.662 --> 33:38.405
Is he alive?

33:45.504 --> 33:46.999
Pity.

33:47.173 --> 33:51.882
A man like that would have
preferred to die fighting.

33:52.053 --> 33:54.045
Take him to the Council Room.

34:26.672 --> 34:27.917
Ambassador Fox?

34:28.966 --> 34:33.344
I am Robert Fox. Have I the honour
of addressing Anan 7?

34:34.806 --> 34:37.047
Welcome to Eminiar, Mr. Ambassador.

34:46.443 --> 34:51.152
Mr. Ambassador, I am truly sorry
for what must happen.

34:51.739 --> 34:53.447
I beg your pardon?

34:53.617 --> 34:56.985
You and your party have been declared
war casualties.

34:57.621 --> 34:59.994
You will be taken immediately
to one of our casualty stations

35:00.166 --> 35:02.454
so that your deaths
may be recorded.

35:05.880 --> 35:08.336
You mean we are to be killed?

35:08.675 --> 35:10.667
That is correct, Mr. Ambassador.

35:10.927 --> 35:14.759
I regret it very much,
but there is nothing I can do about it.

35:25.692 --> 35:27.566
Spock to Enterprise. Come in.

35:27.736 --> 35:30.488
Mr. Scott, it's Mr. Spock.

35:30.864 --> 35:32.822
Scotty here, Mr. Spock. Go ahead.

35:34.118 --> 35:36.241
- Is the ship all right?
- We've been through a bit,

35:36.412 --> 35:38.784
but we're all right now.
How about the captain and you?

35:38.956 --> 35:41.957
The captain is overdue. We've
suffered no casualties among us.

35:42.126 --> 35:43.407
This is important.

35:43.586 --> 35:47.370
Under no circumstances shall anyone
beam down from the Enterprise.

35:47.549 --> 35:49.458
They'd be killed
the moment they arrived.

35:49.634 --> 35:52.837
That ties it. That popinjay Fox
went down a couple of minutes ago.

35:53.555 --> 35:56.307
- The ambassador?
- I knew it had a rotten ring to it.

35:56.850 --> 36:00.515
Orbit out to maximum phaser range
and stand by for further orders.

36:00.687 --> 36:02.265
Spock out.

36:09.238 --> 36:10.898
What are you going to do,
Mr. Spock?

36:11.073 --> 36:13.743
Find the ambassador
and the captain.

36:14.910 --> 36:16.737
Yeoman Tamura, you stay here

36:16.913 --> 36:19.617
and prevent this young lady
from immolating herself.

36:19.791 --> 36:23.041
Knock her down and sit on her,
if necessary. This is a killing situation.

36:23.211 --> 36:25.250
Do what you must to protect yourself.
Clear?

36:25.421 --> 36:26.916
Yes, sir.

36:42.439 --> 36:43.471
What are you doing?

36:43.649 --> 36:46.401
I'm a representative of
the United Federation of Planets!

36:46.569 --> 36:48.193
A special representative.

36:48.362 --> 36:49.856
Get in line.

36:54.076 --> 36:55.619
- Mr. Spock.
- Please, Mr. Fox.

36:55.787 --> 36:57.613
Ladies and gentlemen,
please move quickly away

36:57.789 --> 37:00.706
from the chamber
or you may be injured.

37:05.046 --> 37:06.291
What are you doing, Mr. Spock?

37:06.464 --> 37:10.130
Practising a peculiar variety
of diplomacy, sir.

37:16.391 --> 37:19.428
I'll take you to a place of comparative
safety, then I must find the captain.

37:19.603 --> 37:21.975
They have him. The guards told us.

37:22.147 --> 37:25.102
They took him to the Council Room
under heavy guard.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.399
By now, Mr. Ambassador,
I'm sure you realise

37:27.570 --> 37:31.105
that normal diplomatic procedures
are ineffective here.

37:31.282 --> 37:35.066
I've never been a soldier, Mr. Spock,
but I learn very quickly.

37:35.244 --> 37:37.914
Very well, sir.
We need all the help we can get.

37:46.882 --> 37:51.876
Captain, surely you can see
the position we are in.

37:52.179 --> 37:56.841
If your people do not report
to our disintegration chambers,

37:57.017 --> 38:01.015
it is a violation of an agreement
that dates back 500 years.

38:01.188 --> 38:03.679
My people are not responsible
for your agreements.

38:03.858 --> 38:08.603
You will be responsible for an
escalation that will destroy everything.

38:09.530 --> 38:12.104
Millions of people horribly killed,

38:12.283 --> 38:14.276
complete destruction
of our culture here.

38:14.452 --> 38:15.994
Yes, and the culture on Vendikar.

38:16.996 --> 38:19.369
Disaster, disease, starvation,

38:19.624 --> 38:23.574
horrible, lingering death,
pain and anguish.

38:24.921 --> 38:26.713
That seems to frighten you.

38:27.049 --> 38:28.876
It would frighten any sane man.

38:30.969 --> 38:32.713
Yes, you're quite right.

38:33.180 --> 38:37.759
Don't you understand, captain?
We have done away with all that.

38:38.686 --> 38:41.391
Now you are threatening
to bring it down on us again.

38:42.064 --> 38:45.896
Are those 500 people of yours
more important

38:46.069 --> 38:48.560
than the hundreds of millions
of innocent people

38:48.738 --> 38:53.234
on Eminiar and Vendikar?
What kind of monster are you?

38:53.410 --> 38:57.110
I'm a barbarian.
You said it yourself.

38:57.289 --> 38:59.827
I had hoped I had spoken
only figuratively.

39:00.500 --> 39:04.581
Oh, no, you were quite accurate.
I plan to prove it to you.

39:09.301 --> 39:10.843
Open a channel to the Enterprise.

39:16.642 --> 39:18.682
You give me no choice, captain.

39:18.853 --> 39:23.100
We are not bandits.
You force us to act as bandits.

39:23.274 --> 39:24.649
This is the USS Enterprise.

39:25.151 --> 39:28.769
Scotty, general order 24 in two hours!
In two hours!

39:32.701 --> 39:36.236
Enterprise, this is Anan 7,

39:36.455 --> 39:39.124
First Councilman of
the High Council of Eminiar.

39:39.791 --> 39:44.335
We hold your captain, his party, your
ambassador and his party prisoners.

39:44.630 --> 39:47.168
Unless you immediately
start transportation

39:47.341 --> 39:52.715
of all personnel aboard your ship to
the surface, the hostages will be killed.

39:53.472 --> 39:55.595
You have 30 minutes.

40:03.816 --> 40:05.774
I mean it, captain.

40:08.071 --> 40:10.644
All that it means is that
I won't be around for the destruction.

40:10.824 --> 40:12.484
You heard me give general order 24.

40:12.659 --> 40:18.828
That means in two hours
the Enterprise will destroy Eminiar Vll.

40:21.752 --> 40:25.203
Planetary defence system.
Open fire on the Enterprise.

40:25.381 --> 40:29.959
I'm sorry, councilman,
the target has moved out of range.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.548
You wouldn't do this.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.802
Hundreds of millions of people...

40:39.312 --> 40:41.768
I didn't start it, councilman...

40:43.024 --> 40:45.562
...but I'm liable to finish it.

41:03.087 --> 41:05.839
Councilman,
I received a message from Vendikar.

41:06.006 --> 41:08.462
Our time is nearly up. Our quota
is short by several thousand.

41:08.634 --> 41:11.256
They accuse us
of reneging on the treaty.

41:11.429 --> 41:14.216
You see? Lt's started.

41:14.724 --> 41:18.058
You're wrong. It hasn't begun.

41:18.394 --> 41:21.811
Councilman, disintegrator station 11
has been destroyed.

41:21.982 --> 41:25.101
Guard positions in tunnels eight
and ten fail to answer.

41:25.277 --> 41:29.025
Earth party reported seen
in corridor 4-A.

41:29.323 --> 41:31.446
You have less than two hours,
councilman.

41:32.075 --> 41:37.236
What I want or don't want has nothing
to do with it. Escalation is automatic.

41:37.414 --> 41:39.656
- You can stop it!
- Stop it?

41:41.377 --> 41:42.919
I'm counting on it.

41:46.924 --> 41:49.000
Open a channel, lieutenant.

41:51.179 --> 41:53.966
This is the commander
of the USS Enterprise.

41:54.682 --> 41:57.719
All cities and installations
on Eminiar Vll

41:57.894 --> 42:03.268
have been located, identified
and fed into our fire control system.

42:03.442 --> 42:05.730
In one hour and 45 minutes,

42:05.902 --> 42:09.947
the entire inhabited surface
of your planet will be destroyed.

42:10.115 --> 42:13.401
You have that long
to surrender your hostages.

42:13.577 --> 42:17.657
What can I do?
Somebody, please tell me.

42:24.964 --> 42:26.209
Hold it!

42:27.300 --> 42:31.547
Over there. You, over there.
Move, move, move.

42:36.893 --> 42:38.518
Now we'll talk.

42:42.816 --> 42:46.268
I had assumed you needed help.
I see I'm in error.

42:46.737 --> 42:50.817
Oh, I need the help.
In there, Mr. Spock.

43:00.001 --> 43:02.326
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in, Scotty.

43:02.503 --> 43:03.962
Aye, captain. Are you all right?

43:04.339 --> 43:07.043
Everything's secure here.
Maintain position.

43:07.509 --> 43:10.344
If everything goes according to plan,
you can beam us up in ten minutes.

43:10.512 --> 43:15.719
If you don't hear from us, carry out
general order 24 on schedule.

43:16.017 --> 43:18.473
Aye, aye, captain.
Is there anything else we can do?

43:19.980 --> 43:22.934
Cross your fingers. Kirk out.

43:25.277 --> 43:28.563
Death, destruction, disease, horror,

43:30.241 --> 43:33.242
that's what war is all about, Anan.

43:34.996 --> 43:37.321
That's what makes it a thing
to be avoided.

43:37.498 --> 43:40.168
You've made it neat and painless.

43:40.877 --> 43:44.460
So neat and painless,
you've had no reason to stop it.

43:44.631 --> 43:47.204
And you've had it for 500 years.

43:47.842 --> 43:52.968
Since it seems to be the only way
I can save my crew and my ship,

43:53.807 --> 43:57.721
I'm going to end it for you.
One way or another.

43:58.729 --> 44:01.054
- Mr. Ambassador?
- Yes, captain?

44:01.315 --> 44:02.892
Would you mind taking these people

44:03.067 --> 44:05.143
out into the corridor
and holding them there?

44:05.611 --> 44:08.067
Gentlemen, if you please.

44:08.406 --> 44:09.781
You.

44:10.449 --> 44:13.534
Come with me. Mr. Osborne.

44:17.707 --> 44:20.280
Our communicators, weapons.

44:30.178 --> 44:31.886
All right, Mr. Spock.

44:32.055 --> 44:34.048
These are the attack computers,
captain.

44:34.224 --> 44:37.095
That one's defence,
that one computes the casualties.

44:37.269 --> 44:39.511
They're all tied in
with a subspace transmission unit

44:39.688 --> 44:43.140
which keeps them in constant contact
with their Vendikan counterparts.

44:43.317 --> 44:46.271
- Yes, go on.
- The moment contact is broken,

44:46.445 --> 44:48.936
it abrogates the agreement between
the two warring parties.

44:49.115 --> 44:50.823
What are you gonna do?

44:51.159 --> 44:53.116
This one's the key.

44:53.369 --> 44:58.744
The circuit is now locked.
Destroy this one, and they'll all go.

44:58.917 --> 45:03.164
- Good. Get him out of here.
- No, wait a minute, please. Please!

45:09.803 --> 45:11.381
Let's go.

45:14.058 --> 45:15.386
Against the wall!

45:29.657 --> 45:33.358
- Do you realise what you have done?
- Yes, I do.

45:33.870 --> 45:36.539
I've given you back
the horrors of war.

45:36.706 --> 45:38.995
The Vendikans will now assume
you've broken your agreement

45:39.167 --> 45:41.658
and that you're preparing to wage
real war with real weapons.

45:41.837 --> 45:45.206
They'll want to do the same.
Only the next attack they launch

45:45.382 --> 45:47.707
will do a lot more than just
count up numbers on a computer.

45:49.136 --> 45:51.461
They'll destroy your cities,
devastate your planet.

45:51.638 --> 45:55.423
You, of course, will want to retaliate.
If I were you, I'd start making bombs.

45:55.601 --> 45:59.433
Yes, councilman,
you have a real war on your hands.

45:59.647 --> 46:02.482
You can either wage it
with real weapons,

46:02.650 --> 46:06.862
or you might consider an alternative.

46:07.780 --> 46:11.196
Put an end to it. Make peace.

46:11.534 --> 46:13.741
There can be no peace.

46:13.912 --> 46:16.913
Don't you see?
We've admitted it to ourselves.

46:17.082 --> 46:20.782
We're a killer species. It's instinctive.
It's the same with you.

46:20.961 --> 46:23.416
Your general order 24.

46:23.755 --> 46:25.748
All right. It's instinctive.

46:26.216 --> 46:28.339
But the instinct can be fought.

46:28.886 --> 46:30.380
We're human beings

46:30.554 --> 46:33.923
with the blood of a million
savage years on our hands.

46:35.393 --> 46:37.385
But we can stop it.

46:37.645 --> 46:41.559
We can admit that we're killers,
but we're not going to kill today.

46:41.774 --> 46:46.152
That's all it takes. Knowing
that we're not going to kill today.

46:47.906 --> 46:49.945
Contact Vendikar.

46:50.742 --> 46:54.443
I think you'll find that they're just as
terrified, appalled, horrified as you are.

46:54.621 --> 46:57.159
That they'll do anything to avoid
the alternative I've given you.

46:57.332 --> 46:59.124
Peace or utter destruction.

47:00.419 --> 47:01.996
It's up to you.

47:02.171 --> 47:05.207
As a third party interested
only in peace

47:05.382 --> 47:08.253
and the establishment
of normal relations,

47:08.427 --> 47:13.801
I shall be glad to offer my services as
negotiator between you and Vendikar.

47:14.100 --> 47:18.809
I've had some small experiences
in such matters.

47:18.980 --> 47:20.937
There may be a chance.

47:21.274 --> 47:26.102
We have a direct channel
with Vendikar's High Council.

47:26.488 --> 47:30.355
- It hasn't been used in centuries.
- Then it's long overdue.

47:30.534 --> 47:31.944
Shall we go?

47:40.961 --> 47:43.666
There's a chance it may work,
captain.

47:46.050 --> 47:49.300
- Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty?
- Scott here, captain.

47:49.470 --> 47:52.305
Cancel implementation
of general order 24.

47:52.473 --> 47:56.138
Alert Transporter Room.
We're ready to beam up.

48:01.649 --> 48:05.065
Lay in a course for Argana II,
navigator. Mr. Scott.

48:05.236 --> 48:07.810
Space detail set, captain.

48:08.031 --> 48:09.940
Message from Eminiar Vll, captain.

48:10.117 --> 48:13.735
Ambassador Fox reports negotiations
are under way with Vendikar.

48:13.912 --> 48:16.284
- Outlook hopeful.
- Good.

48:16.457 --> 48:19.991
Captain, you took a big chance.

48:20.419 --> 48:22.459
Did I, Mr. Spock?

48:22.630 --> 48:24.504
They had been killing
3 million people a year.

48:24.673 --> 48:27.840
It had been going on for 500 years.
An actual attack wouldn't have killed

48:28.010 --> 48:30.050
any more people than one
of their computer attacks,

48:30.221 --> 48:32.261
but it would've ended
their ability to make war.

48:32.515 --> 48:35.516
The fighting would've been over.
Permanently.

48:35.685 --> 48:37.512
But you didn't know that
it would work.

48:39.022 --> 48:41.893
No. It was a calculated risk.

48:42.067 --> 48:45.685
Still, the Eminians keep
a very orderly society,

48:46.363 --> 48:50.657
and actual war is
a very messy business.

48:51.243 --> 48:53.734
A very, very messy business.

48:53.912 --> 48:57.862
I had a feeling that they would do
anything to avoid it. Even talk peace.

48:58.876 --> 49:00.869
A feeling is not much to go on.

49:02.004 --> 49:05.669
Sometimes a feeling, Mr. Spock,
is all we humans have to go on.

49:06.384 --> 49:10.547
Captain, you almost make me
believe in luck.

49:11.055 --> 49:15.764
Why, Mr. Spock, you almost make me
believe in miracles.
