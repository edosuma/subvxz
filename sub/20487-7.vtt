22:01.253 --> 22:03.890

22:03.923 --> 22:05.392

22:05.425 --> 22:07.394
Who wants you dead,
do you think?

22:07.427 --> 22:08.895
Well, two years ago I did

22:08.928 --> 22:10.863
a piece about
the state prosecutor,

22:10.897 --> 22:12.799
Dana Seetahal,
who was shot dead.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.234
When state prosecutor
Dana Seetahal left

22:15.267 --> 22:18.738
the Ma Pau car park just
before midnight on May 3rd,

22:18.771 --> 22:22.008
she had no inclination it
would be her last moments alive.

22:22.041 --> 22:25.211
When Mark began to look into
the murder of the prosecutor,

22:25.244 --> 22:26.679
an informant told him

22:26.713 --> 22:29.582
there was a $20,000 contract
on his life.

22:29.616 --> 22:32.485
They had people following me
over a period of time,

22:32.519 --> 22:34.721
some law enforcement officers
and so on,

22:34.754 --> 22:38.425
so my company put me on a plane.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.359
I went... I stayed

22:40.393 --> 22:44.363

Walter Cronkite,

22:56.876 --> 22:58.578
"It's not what you

22:58.611 --> 23:00.246
It's what they need to know."

23:00.279 --> 23:02.949
We need to have people held
accountable for certain things.

23:02.982 --> 23:08.020

Trinidad continues to be
a major transshipment point

23:12.559 --> 23:14.060
for drug dealers

23:14.093 --> 23:17.296
to get that product out
to North America

23:17.329 --> 23:18.931
and to Europe,

23:18.965 --> 23:22.134
so you find now
the explosion of violence

23:22.168 --> 23:24.136
that we have is for those

23:24.170 --> 23:27.774
that are involved locally
with the drug trafficking,

23:27.807 --> 23:29.642
this fight for territory.

23:29.676 --> 23:33.546
An estimated $3.5 billion
worth of narcotics

23:33.580 --> 23:35.882
moves through
the Caribbean each year.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.817
Trinidad's porous borders,

23:37.850 --> 23:40.419
busy port,
proximity to Venezuela,

23:40.453 --> 23:43.155
and the inevitable corruption
that comes with numbers

23:43.189 --> 23:45.124
and threats like that make it,

23:45.157 --> 23:48.628
unfortunately,
an ideal transshipment point.

23:50.497 --> 23:54.501
How bad is high-level
corruption alleged to be?

23:54.534 --> 23:57.136
Fairly deep.
I think that the complicity

23:57.169 --> 24:00.607
comes across the law
enforcement agencies,

24:00.640 --> 24:05.578
customs, police officers,
even at higher levels.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.848
And with corruption,
poverty, hopelessness,

24:08.881 --> 24:10.917
add some radical ideology
to that,

24:10.950 --> 24:13.853
and Trinidad has proved
relatively fertile ground

24:13.886 --> 24:17.189
for the recruitment
of ISIS fighters...

24:17.223 --> 24:18.791
and terrorists.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.761
It's quite alarming,
Trinidadian nationals

24:21.794 --> 24:25.131
being one of the highest
in the region going to Syria,

24:25.164 --> 24:28.034

24:28.067 --> 24:31.203

calling from ISIS

24:31.237 --> 24:32.505

really good people

people would go?

I'd have to go back into

27:38.825 --> 27:40.392
my childhood
to explain that to you.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.728
The coup that happened here

27:41.761 --> 27:43.395
happened when
I was six years old.

27:43.429 --> 27:46.032
They had all these young people
in there who had this idea,

27:46.065 --> 27:47.592
you know, we're going
to build this thing.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.061
There's this community
that's gonna stand up

27:49.068 --> 27:50.502
against what's going on
in Trinidad,

27:50.536 --> 27:52.404
that's going to stand up
against the drugs

27:52.438 --> 27:53.906
and stand up against poverty

27:53.940 --> 27:56.709
and stand up against crime,
and nothing happened.

27:56.743 --> 27:59.011
In none of these causes,

27:59.045 --> 28:03.916
religious fundamentalism
or fervor has not come up.

28:03.950 --> 28:06.218
You... every... every issue
you've mentioned so far

28:06.252 --> 28:08.721
has been perceived
inadequacy of social justice.

28:08.755 --> 28:09.922
Right, yeah.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.759
So these kids
going off to Syria,

28:12.792 --> 28:14.360
do they have any idea
what they're doing?

28:14.393 --> 28:16.188
- No, they do not.
- Or are they just pissed off?

28:16.195 --> 28:18.931
No, they do not. People say
that poverty breeds crime.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.625
I don't think poverty
breeds crime in a sense.

28:20.632 --> 28:24.370
I think exclusion breeds crime
because if I truly care for you,

28:24.403 --> 28:27.539
if I feel like you are a part
of the thing that I exist in,

28:27.573 --> 28:29.341
then I won't... I won't hurt you.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.077
Might come in your house
and steal some food,

28:31.110 --> 28:32.912
but when you see
that kind of violence

28:32.945 --> 28:34.713
being enacted,
you have to ask yourself.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.115
It's not just somebody saying,

28:36.148 --> 28:37.709
"I need this tablecloth.
I'm gonna take this."

28:37.716 --> 28:40.286
No, "I want this tablecloth",

28:40.319 --> 28:42.621
"and you, you had this
tablecloth for too long,

28:42.654 --> 28:44.483
"so you know what,
I'm gonna take this out on you.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.558
This is gonna happen.
That's gonna happen."

28:46.592 --> 28:48.360
And that's what
we're seeing now.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.241
I mean, how long can people
put up with something

28:50.262 --> 28:53.399
before they decide this is
enough, you know what I mean?

28:53.432 --> 28:56.435
Would you say that Carnival
and that Carnival attitude,

28:56.468 --> 29:00.206
the liming culture is a...

29:00.239 --> 29:04.410
Might as well be a brilliant
strategy to narcotize

29:04.443 --> 29:07.446
the people into being satisfied
with the status quo?

29:07.479 --> 29:13.219
Everything here is somehow
designed to...

29:13.252 --> 29:16.122
pacify it
without us really realizing,

29:16.155 --> 29:19.758
so our music, which is
supposed to give us adrenaline

29:19.792 --> 29:21.293
as well as sleeping pills
sometimes,

29:21.327 --> 29:22.995
it's just doling
out sleeping pills.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.097
Like, go ahead, enjoy yourself.
Enjoy yourself.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.432
Enjoy yourself.
You are Trini.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.901
Trini means fun-loving and happy

29:31.103 --> 29:31.938

home-cooked meal.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.339

29:40.346 --> 29:42.081
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.283
- Red snapper?
- Yeah, yeah.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.185
The snapper is seasoned
with lime juice,

29:46.218 --> 29:49.121
shado beni and onion.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.290
What's this dish called?
Is there a name for it?

29:51.323 --> 29:53.192
- This is called oil down.
- Oil down?

29:53.225 --> 29:54.526
- Yeah.
- For oil down

29:54.560 --> 29:55.962
they season breadfruit

29:55.995 --> 29:58.030
and meat with dasheen
and green figs,

29:58.064 --> 30:00.366
then simmer in coconut milk.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.501
And, well, she uses pork,
as you can see,

30:02.534 --> 30:05.204
which I... now I can't have any,
so that's okay.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.139
Now your grandma, not a Muslim?

30:07.173 --> 30:11.377
No, the Roman Catholic-est
of all Roman Catholics.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.146
- Old-school?
- Sacred heart up on the wall.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.116
I got a kind of a perfect one
for you, so you have this.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.118
- Oh, beautiful, thank you.
- Pastel.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.488
This is mostly when
the Spaniards where here,

30:22.521 --> 30:24.556
introduced this.
This is a Spanish one.

30:24.590 --> 30:28.227
Pastels are the Caribbean
cousin to the tamale.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.329
Minced beef is wrapped
in cornmeal dough,

30:30.362 --> 30:33.799
then in banana leaf,
then steamed.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.401
Table for sure.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.904
She will feed you till
you burst like any grandmother.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.671
You know, right?
Yeah.

30:39.705 --> 30:42.208
- I'll be well looked after.
- And that is once a year.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.210
- So when do these ordinarily...
- Christmastime.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.578
Christmas, oh.
This is very, very delicious.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.714
Thank you very much,
and one thing I've asked about.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.349
Why you didn't put ice
in his glass?

30:50.382 --> 30:52.051
It's good.
It's fine.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.053
So he must say thanks
to whatever you made.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.754
Tell Muhammad it's not good.

30:55.787 --> 30:59.725
See how... see how
that generation, very proper,

30:59.758 --> 31:01.427
like, very, very proper,

31:01.460 --> 31:03.896
and one of the things
about Trinidad is that...

31:03.930 --> 31:05.497
Muhammad, don't bad-talk me.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.567
I'm not bad-talking you.
I only speak the truth.

31:08.600 --> 31:12.905
That generation very much
believed in independence

31:12.939 --> 31:14.606
and that this nation
would be something,

31:14.640 --> 31:16.108
and then they told
their children,

31:16.142 --> 31:18.244
"Study and come
and help this nation.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.279
Build this nation,
and it's gonna be something."

31:20.312 --> 31:22.781
And that generation, which was
my parents, they did that.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.116
Right.

31:24.150 --> 31:27.286
And then they had kids,
you know?

31:27.319 --> 31:29.755
And all of a sudden it was like,
okay, all these things

31:29.788 --> 31:32.058
you have been saying about
building a nation and whatever,

31:32.091 --> 31:34.153
how come I'm seeing these people
benefitting, and I'm not?

31:34.160 --> 31:36.155
How come I'm seeing this, I'm
seeing that, I'm seeing that?

31:36.162 --> 31:37.990
And there were very few answers,
you know what I mean?

31:37.997 --> 31:39.465
So who runs this country?

31:39.498 --> 31:42.101
Like everywhere else, that 1%.
Like everywhere else.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.971
Everybody here
is very eager to tell you

31:45.004 --> 31:47.139
what a wonderful mix it is,

31:47.173 --> 31:49.241
and the food, if you look at it,

31:49.275 --> 31:52.778
it does... is this incredibly
harmonious stew pot.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.246
Right.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.248
But I guess life
doesn't work as well as food.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.250
No. The only thing
we've agreed on in this place

31:58.284 --> 31:59.718

to put in anything.

32:44.363 --> 32:47.933
industrialization
is changing the landscape here,

32:50.236 --> 32:53.539
remain, echo from
all the way back then...

32:58.910 --> 33:03.549
When West African slaves
would covertly do this,

33:03.582 --> 33:05.351
Calinda.

33:05.384 --> 33:08.020
This martial art,
based on our research,

33:08.054 --> 33:10.989
is maybe 500, 600 years old.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.558
Stick fighting variations

33:12.591 --> 33:14.393
occur throughout the Caribbean,

33:14.426 --> 33:17.329
but in Trinidad and Tobago it's,
like, deep in their blood.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.803
This martial art was illegal
for many, many years.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.338
Yes?
Yeah.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.433
I mean, certainly during
slavery times it was illegal.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.376
To this day,
I believe there's still laws

33:30.409 --> 33:33.011
on our books
that ban this stick,

33:33.045 --> 33:34.980
and if you're caught with it,
you could go to jail.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.084
The laws of slavery times
forced this sport underground.

33:38.117 --> 33:42.854
Like Capoeira, it often had
to be disguised as a dance,
