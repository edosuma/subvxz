WEBVTT

01:32.509 --> 01:33.510
Do you trust me?

01:34.511 --> 01:36.138
I wish I had never met you.

01:36.138 --> 01:40.392
But you did, and we are here now,

01:41.435 --> 01:46.148
an entire galaxy pivoting around
the actions of an individual, you.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.319
Raych...

01:52.404 --> 01:55.157
I don't think that I can do this.

01:55.157 --> 02:00.245
And you, more than anyone
know what's really at stake here.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.916
I hate what you've done to us.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.794
I know. It'll help if you're angry.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.420
I'm not angry. I--

02:13.383 --> 02:14.384
I love you.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.805
I know that too, Son.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.529
Do it.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.616
Go straight to the cryo-pod.
It's programmed for you.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.994
And don't stop to say goodbye to her.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.164
Don't implicate her in this.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.625
Raych.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.340
I'm still dreaming, aren't I?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.176
This isn't a dream.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.140
How are you still alive?

03:44.308 --> 03:47.311
I'm not. I died on <i>the Deliverance.</i>

03:48.937 --> 03:50.147
You got them all fooled.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.441
They think you care about them.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.611
But the truth is,
you don't care about anyone.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.780
They're all just points on a graph.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.450
It's why you're gonna fail.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.869
'Cause you don't care who lives or dies.

04:03.869 --> 04:07.331
- You weren't meant to die.
- But you changed the plan.

04:07.331 --> 04:12.586
You implicated me 'cause you didn't
trust me. If you had, I would've lived.

04:12.586 --> 04:16.214
As it was, they shot me out
the air lock like garbage.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.719
Left me floating frozen for all eternity.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.679
You weren't garbage.

04:23.514 --> 04:24.515
No.

04:33.023 --> 04:38.195
I was your son, and you let me die.

04:40.906 --> 04:46.078
But why am I surprised? We both know
it wasn't the first time.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.027
You all right?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.820
He hasn't had legs in over a century.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.323
You know, about the legs,
how did you get them, Hari?

06:04.323 --> 06:08.660
I told you, I don't know. I was directed
towards Oona's World by Kalle.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.662
How? You were trapped
in the Prime Radiant.

06:10.662 --> 06:14.166
She appeared to me.
My mind was long gone by then.

06:14.166 --> 06:18.212
She implied that she was the manifestation
of the Prime Radiant itself.

06:18.212 --> 06:22.299
I met her. She was as solid as me, but she
didn't register as living on our scopes.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.258
And I do?

06:23.258 --> 06:24.510
Yes.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.388
My body is as it was the moment
before I died.

06:29.515 --> 06:35.270
I walked into the cave with Kalle. I stood
in the darkness, weightless and waiting.

06:36.522 --> 06:40.984
And then I awoke beside you
feeling the tug of gravity on my spine.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.069
She cloned you.

06:43.111 --> 06:47.032
So, after a century and a half,
the Genetic Dynasty has a rival.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.034
The irony isn't lost on me.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.911
Someone wanted you flesh and blood again.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.289
And after all that trouble you went to,
turning yourself into an idea.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.793
Have a look at this.
I picked up some transmissions.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.630
Foundation has spread all over
the Outer Reach.

07:02.130 --> 07:05.384
They're selling psychohistory as magic.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.303
They're selling you. The Prophet.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.639
Not me. Him. The other Seldon.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.433
And it was bound to happen.
People do love to kneel.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.185
<i>Approaching Ignis.</i>

07:15.185 --> 07:16.478
Coming up on Ignis.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.272
Unless you hijacked my ship again.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.781
Ignis. Imperial holding
a thousand years ago.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.326
Diverse life, but no humans since
Empire walked away.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.079
So, if there's no one here,
then who is calling us?

07:35.205 --> 07:36.415
Breaking atmo.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.171
- Fuck!
- What?

07:44.381 --> 07:47.301
Negative ionic particles in the atmosphere
have caused a system reboot.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.218
What does that mean?

07:48.218 --> 07:50.470
Well, it means that I've only got roll.
I'm flying dead stick.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.889
- Is that bad?
- Yes!

07:56.810 --> 07:58.103
- Can you get us down?
- Shut up!

07:59.313 --> 08:01.857
- Trees!
- I know!

08:07.863 --> 08:09.364
Come on!

08:20.584 --> 08:21.543
Hari, you hurt?

08:21.543 --> 08:26.048
Just a little. It's been a while since
I felt physical pain. It's exhilarating.

08:26.548 --> 08:27.799
Maybe in small doses.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.718
Run a diagnostic. I'll be back.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.053
Where are you going?

08:31.553 --> 08:33.429
The jungle.
Someone was watching our descent.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.058
I think you should help us
repair the ship first.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.934
Well, we made a lot of noise coming down.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.895
If someone's looking for us,
I'd rather meet them outside than in here.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.775
Fuck! Boarding ramp was damaged
in the landing. I'll take the air lock.

08:54.743 --> 08:58.330
You're letting what you saw
in your vision affect you. Don't.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.760
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.680
They're bound to embargo any recording
of an assassination attempt.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.140
True. And recordings from Empire's
bedchamber are off-limits.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.934
And on the question of my family?

09:18.934 --> 09:20.477
There's nothing, Dominion. I'm sorry.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.439
Thank you, Markley.
We'll have another request soon.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.900
The attempt was in Day's bedroom.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.070
Guess I'll have to work my way in
for a look around.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.030
Are you sure that's the only way?

09:32.614 --> 09:35.617
You don't like me offering my young,
dimpled flesh for information?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.829
Don't fret, Rue.
I won't give more than I choose to.

09:38.829 --> 09:43.750
I hope not. Sometimes I wonder where
the shy, sad princess Sareth went.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.794
She died with the rest of my family.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.561
She wants to copulate.

10:02.561 --> 10:05.606
As you hoped. You want a real alliance,
not a paper one.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.567
Yes. It's all coming together.
But I have--

10:09.359 --> 10:11.945
I've grown accustomed to you
in this regard.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.033
You're a man. An impressive man
by any measure.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.910
She'll not have seen the like.

10:18.702 --> 10:19.578
Exactly.

10:19.578 --> 10:25.334
And since she proposed the tryst, she will
likely be ready. It needn't take long.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.505
And I can feel that you're ready.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.302
- I'll stay close.
- Okay.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.681
Think of me.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.950
Come in, Sareth.
I've been anticipating you.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.119
Thank you for agreeing to this.

11:01.620 --> 11:05.958
I understand that matters of romance
are important to young ladies.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.753
The inner sanctum. May I?

11:09.753 --> 11:11.421
Please. Look around.

11:13.882 --> 11:19.137
Wow. Look at you. That's something.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.639
Thank you.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.141
Is it being repaired?

11:24.601 --> 11:27.896
It's mold. Parasites.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.400
It's old. It originally depicted Cleon I,

11:31.400 --> 11:35.320
but it's reconceived for each Day
to highlight their particular contribution

11:35.320 --> 11:36.321
to the Empire.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.825
Are those the Orbital Rings above you?
Very dramatic.

11:40.450 --> 11:43.704
My brother started them.
I finished the job.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.082
They're so much more visible
than I thought they would be.

11:47.082 --> 11:50.377
They were originally designed
to be invisible from the ground.

11:50.377 --> 11:55.674
But I wanted people to see the arches,
like a shackle around the world.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.928
The citizens need to be
reminded that they're only alive

11:59.928 --> 12:01.263
because I will it so.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.810
Your aura. Do you wear it even
when you're intimate?

12:08.187 --> 12:09.396
Always.

12:09.396 --> 12:13.150
Dialed up so high? What if you want to,

12:13.734 --> 12:16.069
I don't know... get spanked?

12:16.695 --> 12:19.781
I imagine there are paddles around here
that would leave the royal crest imprinted

12:19.781 --> 12:20.741
on one's bottom.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.034
I'll order some made.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.915
Your bed is very comfortable.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.461
There's an old saying that

12:33.295 --> 12:36.048
a king's head never rests lightly
on his pillow.

12:36.048 --> 12:37.424
Is that right?

12:37.424 --> 12:40.636
I just think those other kings need
better pillows.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.722
And I think you've told that joke before.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.894
Still laughing about the pillow?

12:48.894 --> 12:50.354
No. At you.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.857
I think you'll find, when a man
and a woman are together,

12:53.857 --> 12:59.530
if you want things to line up properly,
the man needs to be on top.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.032
I feel a fool.

13:02.032 --> 13:05.244
You'll learn. Let's get your gown up.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.704
Your knees?

13:07.704 --> 13:08.956
- No.
- What are you--

13:08.956 --> 13:10.958
No, I've got it.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.920
Now, that's my toe.
All right. I've got it.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.217
- Do you need me to--
- Don't talk.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.308
You've done this before.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.519
Honestly, never quite like this.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.938
You're putting on an act.
I know you've had a lover.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.858
They were killed in the accident
that put you on the throne.

13:35.858 --> 13:39.194
Why am I not surprised you know
so much of my family's final days?

13:39.194 --> 13:40.904
You have no wish to bed with me.

13:43.198 --> 13:47.703
I know why you're here.
I was almost killed in this room.

13:47.703 --> 13:48.912
It was this room?

13:48.912 --> 13:52.165
I watched you sliding around here,
picturing the whole thing,

13:52.165 --> 13:53.959
looking for how they failed.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.086
You wish they got me, don't you?

13:56.086 --> 13:59.214
Maybe you think that would even
some imaginary scale of justice?

13:59.214 --> 14:01.550
Maybe you paid for that result?

14:01.550 --> 14:04.261
Yes! I was trying to figure out
how assassins got in here.

14:04.261 --> 14:06.221
Not because I hired them.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.849
Because I'm trying to figure out
if it's safe to live here.

14:08.849 --> 14:12.144
Have you ever even tried to think
about things from my point of view?

14:12.769 --> 14:14.855
Do you even know what another
point of view is?

14:14.855 --> 14:18.025
How could you?
The people closest to you are you.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.360
You think I can't make you safe?

14:20.360 --> 14:24.072
I am turning Trantor upside down.
I will find the traitors--

14:24.072 --> 14:26.241
You've been searching for days,
and you've found nothing yet.

14:26.241 --> 14:29.244
Excuse me, Empire, but I am not reassured.

14:29.244 --> 14:32.372
If you're declining my offer of marriage,
say it now!

14:32.372 --> 14:33.832
And sign my own death warrant?

14:34.958 --> 14:38.378
Find your traitor and vow to
make it safe, if you can, and I accept.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.589
Of course, I can. This I vow!

14:40.589 --> 14:43.342
- Then I accept!
- Now leave!

15:07.282 --> 15:08.534
Did you hear it all?

15:08.534 --> 15:10.702
No. I moved down the servant-way.

15:11.995 --> 15:15.499
She suspects I killed her family.
I had to accuse her of trying to kill me.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.168
It got heated. We're engaged.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.379
Best wishes.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.383
And the killing of her family,
there's no trail back to you.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.634
I made sure of that.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.302
We have to be careful with her.

15:28.804 --> 15:31.932
She's smart
and not above making plans of her own.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.105
The Empress-to-be is luckier
than she deserves.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.528
And you are unfulfilled.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.496
Thank you, Empire.

15:54.496 --> 15:55.581
Call me Cleon.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.130
I like that.

16:05.757 --> 16:09.803
You're toothsome.
How did you get so delicious?

16:09.803 --> 16:11.847
I eat a lot of salt, Cleon.

16:14.725 --> 16:15.726
I'm pre-seasoned.

16:16.935 --> 16:17.936
What's your name?

16:20.022 --> 16:22.608
Rue. Rue Corintha from Dominion.

16:23.734 --> 16:27.237
Beautiful name. Beautiful person.

16:29.907 --> 16:35.120
Well, I'm going to mute the effect,
in case you want to bite back.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.050
Extraordinary.

16:49.885 --> 16:52.930
Can we go earlier? To when you
picked me in the Gossamer Court?

16:55.265 --> 16:58.227
Things are getting so extremely
interesting here in the present.

16:58.227 --> 17:03.524
We'll return to that.
Waiting is half the fun.

17:03.524 --> 17:06.568
Fine. Earlier in the day, it is.

17:10.864 --> 17:14.492
This was assembled from many lenses
at Gossamer Court.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.290
And there you are.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.105
I think they're trying to
get your attention.

17:43.689 --> 17:46.024
One of them is likely to sprain something.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.110
Tragic.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.865
And what do you do
to get someone's attention?

17:53.490 --> 17:56.743
Me? I refuse to look up from my game.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.288
Is it having the effect you want?

18:01.331 --> 18:05.085
I can only see your feet, so I'm not
too sure. But the banter is promising.

18:09.548 --> 18:12.467
<i>I remember that.
My memory ends right after.</i>

18:13.135 --> 18:14.803
<i>And now you can go back to the sex part.</i>

18:21.310 --> 18:24.146
Are you aware it's missing? The memory?

18:25.022 --> 18:26.064
No.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.944
I reached for your hand, and then I was
on a transport headed home

18:31.778 --> 18:35.240
with a bite mark on my shoulder
and a full bank account.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.952
It all seemed to make perfect sense,
like nothing was missing.

18:39.453 --> 18:40.412
Really?

18:41.413 --> 18:45.167
I imagined an awkward blank space
making itself known, like--

18:45.167 --> 18:47.711
like a wad of cotton in one's mind.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.757
You know, I thought, since you have
the ability, that you might--

18:54.676 --> 18:56.345
You never edit your own recollections?

18:57.554 --> 19:01.016
I can imagine an emperor cutting away
moments he chooses to forget.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.936
But you couldn't let them
be lost to history.

19:05.562 --> 19:11.276
No, they would reside in the Memorium
with the rest of my normal audits.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.321
It's a fascinating idea though.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.156
What?

19:21.912 --> 19:24.039
An end to regrets.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.750
Would you do that?

19:28.877 --> 19:32.923
Never. I embrace regrets.

19:33.507 --> 19:36.134
I wanna remember the view
from the top of the mountain.

19:38.512 --> 19:41.431
Even if that means I also have to
remember the fall.

19:42.850 --> 19:46.895
You're lucky to be able
to trust your memories.

20:31.315 --> 20:35.110
Looks like you haven't quite mastered the
gentle art of sneaking up from behind.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.988
That's very good. You should think about--

20:37.988 --> 20:39.114
Drop it.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.661
Raise your hands. Take off that mask.

20:53.337 --> 20:54.630
Hi, Sal.

20:56.173 --> 20:57.799
No. You have to be dead by now.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.260
- Are you disappointed?
- No, but--

21:00.260 --> 21:04.348
But you're you. And you get a gift horse,
and you check its mouth.

21:04.932 --> 21:07.226
<i>The Beggar</i> told me you were going
into cryosleep.

21:07.226 --> 21:09.770
Nothing left for me on Terminus, Sal,
so I did the same.

21:09.770 --> 21:12.523
I may have given you command,
but she's still coded to me.

21:12.523 --> 21:15.859
I set my cryo-pod for a synchronous
wake cycle with <i>the Beggar</i>.

21:15.859 --> 21:19.029
The moment you decided to come back
into the world, I would too.

21:20.364 --> 21:21.865
But how could you be here?

21:22.366 --> 21:24.910
You've been bouncing
all around this quadrant, Sal.

21:26.078 --> 21:28.163
Picked up your trajectory on Oona's World.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.668
I reached Ignis half a day before you.

21:34.253 --> 21:39.424
And next thing I know, I was hearing
your dulcet tones once again.

21:59.862 --> 22:00.946
I'm sorry.

22:02.281 --> 22:06.285
I didn't mean to be so cold earlier
about Salvor and the vision.

22:07.578 --> 22:09.079
I can't get it out of my head,

22:09.079 --> 22:12.165
so there's no point telling me
to just stop thinking about it.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.626
Either help me or just don't say anything.

22:16.003 --> 22:19.715
The whole premise of psychohistory
is that the future isn't set in stone.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.967
But all my visions have come true.

22:25.095 --> 22:29.141
On Synnax, you dreamt of a great wave
crashing down on you.

22:29.141 --> 22:31.393
It didn't. You're here.

22:32.311 --> 22:34.938
So how will we know which of our actions

22:34.938 --> 22:36.273
will stop Salvor's fate?

22:36.273 --> 22:39.443
We can't. Even if we could, should we?

22:40.903 --> 22:42.362
You just want me to give up on her

22:42.362 --> 22:44.907
because you can't make yourself
care about anything oth--

22:44.907 --> 22:47.284
Hey! She's Raych's child as well.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.995
That makes her my granddaughter.

22:50.829 --> 22:51.872
If I'd known--

22:51.872 --> 22:55.209
You what?
Would you have done it differently?

22:56.335 --> 22:58.837
I don't know. I'd like to think I would.

23:01.298 --> 23:04.927
But an embryo is a very different
proposition to an actual person.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.682
We hadn't decided yet

23:11.934 --> 23:13.810
if we were gonna have the baby.

23:16.104 --> 23:19.525
'Cause he knew he wouldn't be here.
We both wanted it.

23:24.571 --> 23:30.160
You have this moment with her right now.
Not everybody gets that.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.962
Gaal, where's the Prime Radiant?

23:41.046 --> 23:42.047
In the cockpit. Why?

23:43.882 --> 23:45.050
She's smiling.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.261
Hide it. Don't tell me where.

23:47.261 --> 23:48.428
Do it now.

23:53.183 --> 23:56.520
Salvor, identify the stranger
you're bringing back to our ship.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.105
Technically,
I think you'll find it's my ship.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.022
Okay.

23:59.022 --> 24:00.816
Hugo Crast, from Terminus.

24:00.816 --> 24:02.818
He's my lighthouse,
the one I told you about.

24:02.818 --> 24:04.862
<i>A little bit more than a lighthouse, Sal.</i>

24:05.362 --> 24:06.363
Open the air lock.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.079
Okay.

24:24.673 --> 24:25.841
Hari, open the door.

24:25.841 --> 24:27.092
Open it, Hari.

24:31.597 --> 24:32.848
Hugo, how tall are you?

24:33.432 --> 24:35.100
Just under two meters.

24:35.601 --> 24:38.520
- 181, according to <i>the Beggar</i>'s records.
- Hari, what are you doing?

24:38.520 --> 24:42.191
<i>The Beggar</i> says your combined weight
is off by three kilograms.

24:42.191 --> 24:46.278
Are you kidding? I could've
sweated that off in the jungle. Open up.

24:48.322 --> 24:49.489
That's not Hugo.

24:49.489 --> 24:53.994
Hari, three kilograms is nothing.
It's a few beers.

24:53.994 --> 24:56.205
It's mass, and Hugo's doesn't add up.

24:56.205 --> 24:58.123
It could be his gear, anything.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.669
I've overridden the ship's systems.
You won't be able to open it.

25:02.669 --> 25:06.507
Dr. Seldon, it's me, Hugo.
I was there at the First Crisis.

25:06.507 --> 25:08.550
I was the one that went
and got the Thespins.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.802
"Hooray for Hugo." Remember all that?

25:11.303 --> 25:12.596
Actually, he doesn't.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.225
Hugo is one of us. This is his ship.

25:17.434 --> 25:18.852
His ship? A Thespin ship.

25:19.728 --> 25:21.855
Then he's still genetically encoded
on the system.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.482
Yeah, that's right. <i>The Beggar</i> knows him.

25:23.482 --> 25:24.942
Transfer control back to him.

25:24.942 --> 25:28.195
I can't. He slaved it to me permanently.

25:28.195 --> 25:32.282
Did he? Well, I reset the ship to origin
settings when I was in the mainframe.

25:32.282 --> 25:34.701
Damn it! If you don't open,
I will give command back to him.

25:34.701 --> 25:35.702
Salvor, wait.

25:35.702 --> 25:36.787
Do it.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.665
<i>Beggar</i>, invoke protocol.

25:39.665 --> 25:42.084
Ship transfer back to Hugo Crast.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.795
Now he can open the air lock himself.

25:45.712 --> 25:46.630
Open it.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.092
Hari, we have a problem.

25:51.426 --> 25:52.928
Salvor, watch out!

25:55.389 --> 25:58.392
Disable the ship's external weapons
or I'll kill her.

26:09.361 --> 26:10.320
Hari!

26:13.949 --> 26:15.784
- Salvor!
- Gaal!

26:26.170 --> 26:27.254
Unthink their minds.

26:36.638 --> 26:37.723
So the engagement's done.

26:38.348 --> 26:40.976
He suspected I was a danger.
I needed to calm him.

26:41.643 --> 26:45.480
And as you've always said, being pulled
closer to the throne has advantages.

26:46.481 --> 26:48.775
I learned the assassins definitely
got into the bedchamber.

26:48.775 --> 26:52.237
They used razor swords, and the fresco
behind the bed got spattered with blood.

26:52.237 --> 26:54.656
But he had dinner with us
the following night.

26:54.656 --> 26:58.243
Is it possible?
Perhaps he was replaced after all.

26:58.243 --> 27:01.079
Markley, we need to find out what happened
in that room the day of the attempt.

27:01.079 --> 27:03.165
I promise you, Dominion,
no one can get those recordings.

27:03.165 --> 27:05.918
Empire gets memory audits,
just like concubines

27:05.918 --> 27:07.461
and others who work at the palace.

27:07.461 --> 27:08.712
And they're kept forever.

27:09.213 --> 27:11.590
Original downloads stored
in a place called the Memorium.

27:11.590 --> 27:12.758
Can you get in?

27:12.758 --> 27:15.928
Yes. But memories of a Cleon?
They'll never release those.

27:17.304 --> 27:18.889
Perhaps not Day's memories.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.977
But surely someone attended to his wounds.

27:29.274 --> 27:32.361
- Claviger?
- Keeper Yartell. Order of Empire.

27:32.361 --> 27:34.655
Day wants a memory audit
from the Asclepium.

27:34.655 --> 27:37.241
I have the date and time boundaries
and the hoard number.

27:37.241 --> 27:38.325
Give it here.

27:41.578 --> 27:43.163
The assassination attempt.

27:45.499 --> 27:47.209
He should have these already.

27:47.209 --> 27:49.628
You know, I do hope somebody's
keeping track of the orders.

27:49.628 --> 27:51.713
He's been tearing through everything
we have of that date

27:51.713 --> 27:54.508
- down to third assistant cook.
- I'm just doing what they told me.

28:08.605 --> 28:09.439
Thank you, Keeper.

28:12.526 --> 28:14.611
I'm concerned, Demerzel.

28:15.195 --> 28:19.783
Are you saying only Day has
the authority to alter his memories?

28:19.783 --> 28:23.620
That's correct. Or yours, or Dawn's.

28:24.788 --> 28:25.789
That can't be right.

28:28.125 --> 28:30.836
Surely we should hold authority in common.

28:31.503 --> 28:34.214
You once did.
But in the aftermath of the attack,

28:34.214 --> 28:35.924
Day was suspicious of you both.

28:37.467 --> 28:40.304
But he saw all the scans.
He knows we're innocent. He--

28:46.977 --> 28:50.731
And yet he's kept his new exclusive power
hugged close to his chest.

28:55.235 --> 28:58.530
If Day excised memories
from myself or Dawn,

29:00.407 --> 29:02.034
how would we ever know?

29:03.410 --> 29:05.746
Your memories are preserved
in the Memorium.

29:06.622 --> 29:09.875
And even more complete,
my memory's unalterable.

29:10.626 --> 29:13.128
So there are two backups
if there is any question.

29:15.839 --> 29:17.424
But I wouldn't know to question.

29:20.177 --> 29:22.638
I wouldn't feel anything is missing.

29:23.430 --> 29:26.975
If Brother Day took such a drastic step,
he would tell me.

29:27.768 --> 29:32.981
And as you know, I must at all times do
what's best for Empire, not just Day.

29:34.149 --> 29:36.276
I would let you know, Brother Dusk.

29:37.277 --> 29:41.073
I will always be here,
as I always have been.

29:42.991 --> 29:44.952
Brother Day takes a great deal
upon himself.

29:56.922 --> 29:57.923
Thank you, Markley.

30:00.342 --> 30:01.343
Play it.

30:02.803 --> 30:05.138
If we can't see the sweep of the sword,
let's see who it landed on

30:05.138 --> 30:06.682
and what they did about it.

30:11.103 --> 30:13.272
<i>A nanotoxin was delivered
via molecular blade.</i>

30:14.022 --> 30:17.025
<i>We have 12 seconds before edema
leads to brain stem death.</i>

30:20.737 --> 30:21.738
<i>Give it to me.</i>

30:26.994 --> 30:28.912
- Half a head.
- It's not possible.

30:28.912 --> 30:31.039
- That's Demerzel.
- Is that a machine? I see machinery.

30:31.039 --> 30:33.250
Trantor had machine people,
but that was millennia ago.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.459
All gone. Banned. None survived.

30:34.459 --> 30:37.421
I've touched her hand.
It was warm and alive.

30:37.421 --> 30:39.089
That's not blood.

30:39.089 --> 30:41.300
But whatever it is,
it would surely spatter.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.885
She was in the bedroom with him.

30:45.804 --> 30:47.097
And she's a robot.

30:51.476 --> 30:56.231
I knew we'd end up here as soon as
Day asked us to leave the throne room.

30:56.815 --> 31:02.279
He's making choices, sending out
incendiary generals on missions.

31:02.863 --> 31:05.365
And now he's taken away this power.

31:07.868 --> 31:10.871
- Certainly not what he intended.
- I've never talked to him.

31:11.747 --> 31:16.460
I haven't either. I never had the humility
to admit I needed to.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.087
Let's see.

31:22.508 --> 31:24.718
What if the corrections
to our genome weren't enough

31:24.718 --> 31:26.220
to make our handprints match?

31:26.220 --> 31:27.304
Don't mention that.

31:28.639 --> 31:32.643
If he knows we're no longer made in his
image, he will lower the ceiling on us.

31:34.061 --> 31:35.062
Now be quiet.

31:38.357 --> 31:39.983
Cleon, we stand before you.

31:40.567 --> 31:44.488
Sons, brothers, selves, to seek
an audience with the august memory

31:44.488 --> 31:46.657
of the source of all that we are.

31:47.324 --> 31:51.870
Our hands tell our stories,
and it is your story.

31:53.205 --> 31:56.291
Pray, hear our question.

31:58.544 --> 31:59.920
I bet it's my palm.

32:16.687 --> 32:20.399
I am the memory of Cleon I.
Who addresses me?

32:21.483 --> 32:26.321
We do. The 16th and 18th exponents
of your being.

32:27.197 --> 32:29.533
We thank you for our lives.

32:30.742 --> 32:32.744
Ask your question, Brothers.

32:33.328 --> 32:36.999
Brother Day has taken sole power
to edit our memories,

32:37.749 --> 32:40.752
and we don't have the authority
to even find out if he's done so.

32:40.752 --> 32:42.880
Is this in accord with your design?

32:43.463 --> 32:45.132
Squabbles amongst you, is it?

32:45.632 --> 32:47.217
He's taking too much power.

32:48.093 --> 32:52.764
The three sides of Empire are unbalanced.
We need to recalibrate--

32:52.764 --> 32:53.849
Enough.

32:56.351 --> 32:57.978
You are one man.

32:57.978 --> 33:02.816
If you become divided,
you dishonor me and what I devised.

33:02.816 --> 33:06.737
To be united is your natural state.

33:08.113 --> 33:12.034
To envy Day is to envy yourselves.

33:12.034 --> 33:14.453
Genetically we are identical.

33:14.453 --> 33:19.750
But in our temperaments we must account
for variations. And this Day,

33:20.334 --> 33:25.464
he allows our domineering side to be o--

33:25.464 --> 33:30.302
I am aware of my own temperament
and their many shades.

33:30.969 --> 33:32.804
They are accounted for.

33:33.514 --> 33:34.640
What do you mean?

33:34.640 --> 33:36.558
This is of no concern to you.

33:37.309 --> 33:38.310
How can you say that?

33:38.852 --> 33:41.939
Didn't you create this interface
so we could ask you for your help?

33:42.564 --> 33:46.318
I am here to give you what you need.
Nothing more.

33:49.154 --> 33:50.948
The dream lives on in you.

33:50.948 --> 33:53.784
Because you kept it alive in you.

34:02.376 --> 34:06.421
Keeper, we want to see data
on our memory hoard.

34:06.421 --> 34:09.299
Specifically, how big are our files?

34:09.299 --> 34:12.803
I was unaware Empire was interested
in metadata.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.514
Did you not find what you were
looking for earlier?

34:17.056 --> 34:18.058
We did not.

34:18.058 --> 34:20.393
Right. Well, I'd have to look it up.

34:20.393 --> 34:24.022
While you're at it,
fetch the same for all Cleons.

34:25.107 --> 34:26.525
We'll have something to compare.

34:26.525 --> 34:30.237
All? How far down?

34:30.904 --> 34:33.407
All the way down.
There have only been 18 of us.

34:33.407 --> 34:34.741
You can do it, man.

34:34.741 --> 34:37.159
I'll need a moment.
Please wait to my left.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.748
Dumb insolence.

34:42.416 --> 34:44.376
I ought to have his thumbs cut off.

34:45.168 --> 34:48.839
Do you get the feeling that we are not
on top of the heap anymore around here?

34:50.549 --> 34:52.301
Do you think-- I mean--

34:52.926 --> 34:55.596
We're not in danger, are we?
We are Empire.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.683
Do you remember who he was?

34:59.683 --> 35:01.685
Emperor Algren? Pre-Cleonic.

35:02.269 --> 35:05.147
Yes. Look at the brushstroke.
Green on the neck.

35:05.147 --> 35:08.734
Added after he died, like a footnote.
What's it symbolize?

35:09.860 --> 35:11.361
It's a graven stripe.

35:12.196 --> 35:17.826
It signifies a betrayer. A traitor.
He was executed for high treason.

35:18.577 --> 35:21.496
We are multiple, but we are mortal.

35:22.414 --> 35:27.252
And I should've seen this coming.
I should've seen all of this coming.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.630
And Day?

35:30.839 --> 35:35.928
Day was always going to write himself
into history, one way or the other.

35:38.347 --> 35:39.556
And there were

35:41.225 --> 35:44.102
little conflicts in my reign

35:44.770 --> 35:47.105
that haven't happened
for hundreds of years,

35:47.648 --> 35:49.650
and I didn't deal with one of them.

35:52.027 --> 35:54.780
Demerzel pacified the galaxy for me.

35:54.780 --> 35:58.033
But Day, even as a young boy,
was ashamed of me for it.

35:59.326 --> 36:01.537
He asked, what will history call me?

36:03.121 --> 36:08.794
Certainly not peace bringer
or conqueror or even betrayer.

36:17.010 --> 36:18.262
You're not dead yet.

36:19.555 --> 36:20.931
Your legacy isn't set.

36:21.974 --> 36:26.728
When a man is old,
he doesn't care what he remembers.

36:28.021 --> 36:29.898
He cares how he's remembered.

36:31.066 --> 36:34.987
And at the end, we're all just memoriums.

36:35.529 --> 36:38.448
Perhaps Day did you a favor
giving away your chair.

36:41.034 --> 36:42.995
Well, now you can have
what I always wanted.

36:44.788 --> 36:45.998
What did you want?

36:46.582 --> 36:47.916
What every young man wants.

36:49.793 --> 36:50.794
A life.

36:52.713 --> 36:53.714
Love.

37:00.053 --> 37:01.930
I was so beautiful.

37:05.142 --> 37:06.185
Empire.

37:09.479 --> 37:10.856
Leave us.

37:14.735 --> 37:15.736
Seventy-eight?

37:16.695 --> 37:19.531
My total cataphyls of memory.

37:19.531 --> 37:20.866
What's my number?

37:22.910 --> 37:24.036
Twenty nine.

37:24.953 --> 37:26.580
Let's look at the rest of the Cleons.

37:27.080 --> 37:31.043
Eighty-nine, 87, 82,

37:31.627 --> 37:33.712
83, another 87.

37:35.172 --> 37:36.298
That's reassuring.

37:36.798 --> 37:41.887
Looks like I am on course to hit
my average by the time I turn--

37:44.348 --> 37:45.724
- What?
- What is it?

37:49.645 --> 37:52.814
Cleon I had 213 cataphyls of memory?

37:53.941 --> 37:56.109
Well, he was special.

37:57.528 --> 38:00.572
It makes sense he'd have
a bigger range of life experience.

38:00.572 --> 38:01.657
It does.

38:03.116 --> 38:04.117
But that much bigger?

38:04.868 --> 38:06.495
Did he have that full of a life?

38:07.287 --> 38:10.207
Or is something missing
from the rest of ours?

38:11.291 --> 38:12.292
What do we do?

38:13.794 --> 38:18.257
Absolutely nothing,
until I can find us some leverage.

38:37.234 --> 38:38.235
Salvor?

38:41.572 --> 38:42.573
You okay?

38:42.573 --> 38:43.657
Physically? Fine.

38:44.908 --> 38:48.120
- Your instincts were right.
- Well, hardly reassuring now, is it?

38:49.162 --> 38:50.247
They took my weapons.

38:50.247 --> 38:52.916
- Then we're prisoners.
- Whose prisoners and where?

38:53.417 --> 38:55.502
Well, this all predates
the Genetic Dynasty.

38:56.461 --> 39:01.049
Emperor Kandar V, his summer palace,
probably left to rot by the Cleons.

39:01.550 --> 39:02.843
There are no guards.

39:02.843 --> 39:04.511
Strange for a prison.

39:05.095 --> 39:06.430
Can you hear that?

39:07.306 --> 39:08.724
We have to go that way.

39:08.724 --> 39:09.808
I can't hear anything.

39:09.808 --> 39:13.478
I do. Voices. Whispers.

39:21.904 --> 39:22.905
Coming from up there.

40:05.030 --> 40:09.451
I am Tellem Bond,
seventh bodily incarnation of Pa'a,

40:09.451 --> 40:14.623
goddess of light, wisdom, flying creatures
and the Second Chamber of Eternity.

40:15.290 --> 40:20.045
Pa'a greets you.
Make her sign and declare yourself.

40:22.089 --> 40:28.387
Goddess, I am Hari Seldon
of Streeling University.

40:28.971 --> 40:30.013
These are my colleagues.

40:30.013 --> 40:32.099
Can they not speak for themselves?

40:36.812 --> 40:38.689
Gaal Dornick of Synnax.

40:40.691 --> 40:41.859
Salvor.

40:41.859 --> 40:45.404
Welcome, Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick

40:45.404 --> 40:49.366
and Salvor Hardin of Terminus.

40:49.366 --> 40:50.951
You are our guests.

40:51.451 --> 40:53.787
Offerings sometimes flow against the tide.

40:53.787 --> 40:56.874
Food, from a god to a man.

40:57.416 --> 40:59.585
Thank you for your hospitality, Goddess.

40:59.585 --> 41:01.044
How do we know it's safe to eat?

41:01.670 --> 41:05.924
I might've killed you as you slept.
Would I wake you to poison you?

41:06.550 --> 41:08.969
Makes me wonder why
you knocked us out in the first place.

41:08.969 --> 41:12.264
I am remote.
I don't receive many visitors.

41:14.266 --> 41:18.896
I needed to know your intentions.
But if it makes you feel imprisoned,

41:18.896 --> 41:20.647
does it make you feel safe?

41:20.647 --> 41:22.399
Makes me feel armed.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.153
You look hard upon a goddess,
Hari Seldon of Streeling.

41:26.904 --> 41:30.449
Apologies. It's just that the sun shines
so brightly above you.

41:31.575 --> 41:33.327
Pa'a is goddess of light.

41:33.327 --> 41:37.581
Indeed. And yet as brightly as
the sun shines,

41:37.581 --> 41:39.416
you don't seem to be casting a shadow.

41:41.668 --> 41:44.713
Your incarnation isn't
very carnate, Goddess.

41:45.297 --> 41:48.759
Whoever's in charge, please,
could we end this charade?

41:55.974 --> 41:57.976
The real Tellem Bond, I presume?

41:58.477 --> 42:00.854
I thought you might be the one to notice.

42:00.854 --> 42:04.650
The mentally incomplete compensate
with their other senses.

42:04.650 --> 42:08.570
Sorry, but I wanted to watch you
without you watching back.

42:09.279 --> 42:12.699
Once you've spent time with us,
you'll understand why we're so cautious.

42:14.409 --> 42:16.328
What brings you to our world?

42:17.329 --> 42:18.330
An instinct.

42:20.332 --> 42:22.876
It's almost like someone's calling to us.
Can you hear that?

42:24.044 --> 42:25.045
Yes.

42:25.838 --> 42:28.549
You mean a voice? My voice.

42:28.549 --> 42:31.426
That's how it's supposed to work.
We're a refuge,

42:31.426 --> 42:33.387
and you heard our welcome message.

42:33.387 --> 42:38.600
You two heard it because you're like us.
You have all your senses.

42:38.600 --> 42:42.312
Some people call it mentallics,
but I prefer "sighted."

42:42.938 --> 42:44.690
I was the first to arrive.

42:45.274 --> 42:50.112
I thought Ignis could serve as a haven
for other sighted, so I called for them.

42:50.737 --> 42:55.993
Like a lighthouse to passing ships.
But I'm borrowing your image.

42:55.993 --> 42:59.746
I always imagine iron filings drawn
by a magnet.

43:00.539 --> 43:01.623
Or a moth to a flame.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.168
Not as deadly.

43:05.586 --> 43:12.050
Anyway, once we found each other,
we were safe and strong.

43:13.260 --> 43:16.180
Telepaths of varying abilities
and talents.

43:16.180 --> 43:18.849
The sad little goddess was you as a child.

43:19.433 --> 43:23.854
My abilities were misread as godhood,
a mistake that almost cost my sanity.

43:23.854 --> 43:27.316
Do not worship children.
It is not good for them.

43:28.150 --> 43:29.401
Most had it worse.

43:29.985 --> 43:34.823
Persecuted on our home worlds,
they fled before they were killed.

43:36.658 --> 43:37.910
Look at Loron's burns.

43:42.206 --> 43:43.373
Josiah's scar.

43:45.209 --> 43:47.419
You know what that's like,
don't you, Gaal?

43:48.170 --> 43:50.297
Running before they can kill you.

43:50.923 --> 43:53.342
I see the little scars,
part of your escape.

43:54.676 --> 43:58.514
Is it ironic being sighted
but unseen by your god?

43:59.223 --> 44:02.226
Well, I see you, even if your god can't.

44:03.352 --> 44:08.857
And you, standing on the cold edge of your
community, desperately wanting to fit in.

44:09.358 --> 44:10.609
You're reading us.

44:11.735 --> 44:13.737
Your minds are clear as water.

44:14.988 --> 44:18.408
The things you've lost. The people.

44:19.993 --> 44:23.372
I'm sorry we had to use
the image of your man, Salvor.

44:24.414 --> 44:27.626
You know, you're a much more sentimental
person than you let on.

44:28.377 --> 44:31.380
Yeah, he kissed me. Fuck you for that.

44:32.089 --> 44:35.968
I didn't think that was gonna happen.
I'm sorry.

44:35.968 --> 44:39.930
But, you know, you're more angry
about being called sentimental.

44:40.848 --> 44:41.849
I like you.

44:44.309 --> 44:48.897
You were the one pretending to be Raych,
the one who was in my head.

44:49.815 --> 44:55.112
Hari Seldon is famous
and famously dead and very hard to read.

44:56.196 --> 44:58.407
I needed you to think about
your death and resurrection

44:58.407 --> 45:00.909
so I could try to understand
what happened.

45:00.909 --> 45:02.995
So do you? What happened?

45:03.495 --> 45:07.416
No idea. Hari's very murky inside.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.835
But I can see you have a plan.

45:10.544 --> 45:14.214
And you think this place
and my sighted are a part of it.

45:15.507 --> 45:18.844
That is correct. It is, and they are.

45:20.721 --> 45:23.098
Come to me tomorrow,
and we will discuss it.

45:24.016 --> 45:26.894
It's stressful, having you all here,

45:27.811 --> 45:29.688
thinking so loudly.

45:30.981 --> 45:32.649
My people need to rest.

45:39.198 --> 45:42.201
How much did you read in my murk?

45:44.244 --> 45:45.245
Enough, dear.

45:54.421 --> 45:55.422
What is it?

45:56.798 --> 45:57.799
You mean this?

46:00.260 --> 46:01.970
Believe it's called the Prime Radiant.

46:02.471 --> 46:03.472
Yes, that's it.

46:05.516 --> 46:07.809
They were certainly trying hard
not to think about it.

46:09.478 --> 46:11.355
I heard Hari tell Gaal to hide it.

46:19.571 --> 46:22.908
I will find it and break it.

46:25.077 --> 46:27.496
There's not going to be
a Second Foundation.
