00:05.600 --> 00:07.680
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:07.760 --> 00:11.040
- Sarah.
- Daniel.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.640
We could have ended it better than we did.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.400
Maybe.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.640
Sarah?

00:28.520 --> 00:30.880
Are you happy, Sam?

00:30.960 --> 00:35.640
- What?
- You deserve to love someone.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.360
Maybe it's not me that's the problem here.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.280
I'm a safe bet.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.600
The tablet talks of a lost city
that's more valuable than anything.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.880
Are you saying the Ancients
actually lost one of their own cities?

00:49.960 --> 00:54.520
No, they didn't lose it. They made it lost...
to other people that might try to find it.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.800
So...

00:55.880 --> 00:59.600
the Lost City is... still lost.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.680
Amulet is from the 12th dynastic period.
Inlay suggests the house of Amenemhet.

01:21.760 --> 01:26.640
Possibly a gift from the king's family to
commemorate a birth, coming of age, or...

01:26.720 --> 01:28.720
It's for luck.

01:31.560 --> 01:35.880
Royal goldsmiths made them for the king,
hoping floodwaters would rise in the Nile,

01:35.960 --> 01:38.160
granting them a bountiful crop.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.800
Good guess.

01:41.880 --> 01:46.880
Dr Jordan sent me a picture a few weeks
ago. I suppose I had a bit of a head start.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.320
I'm Sarah Gardner.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.680
- Is that seat taken?
- Well, no.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.520
But there are plenty
of other empty... tables.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.280
Yeah, but none of them have single,
beautiful women sitting at them.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.720
- How do you know I'm single?
- There's no ring on your finger.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.640
- I could have a boyfriend.
- You're by yourself at 7.30 in the morning.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.240
- You're very observant.
- I'm a cop.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.400
Well then, I feel compelled to warn you,

03:52.320 --> 03:55.200
most of the guys I've dated recently
have died.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.160
- As in...
- Dead.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.800
- How?
- Various circumstances.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.840
I'll risk it.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.080
How about dinner tonight?
My motel room.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.960
- Your motel room.
- I'm in town from Denver on a case.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.560
We'll order room service,
open a box of wine...

04:14.640 --> 04:18.279
- A box!
- Something with a duck on the front.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.840
- Stop it, Pete.
- I'm on a roll here!

04:26.920 --> 04:29.360
I haven't even shown you my badge yet.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.000
Aw. And I gotta go.

04:32.080 --> 04:36.080
Come on, Sam, call in sick. Spend the day
with me. We'll go to the zoo.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.160
There's no zoo in Colorado Springs.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.800
Bowling. There must be a bowling alley
around here somewhere.

04:42.880 --> 04:47.200
- I have to work.
- Can't deep-space telemetry wait a day?

04:47.280 --> 04:50.640
Have you seen how much deep space
there is out there?

04:53.880 --> 04:56.320
I'll see you tonight.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.040
It jams the frequencies
the Goa'uld use for communication

05:07.120 --> 05:09.960
and remote control of devices
like ring transporters.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.400
Right now we're working on
making it portable enough to...

05:15.880 --> 05:21.040
- At least pretend it's interesting.
- It's very interesting. Please go on.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.440
- Are you tired?
- You think?

05:23.520 --> 05:26.200
- I had the weirdest dream last night.
- About what?

05:26.280 --> 05:29.960
Working with Sarah back in Chicago,
before the Stargate programme.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.080
How's that weird?

05:32.160 --> 05:35.080
Things were all mixed up,
my hair was different...

05:35.160 --> 05:37.160
Well...

05:38.080 --> 05:41.600
No offence, but it's not like
you don't have some issues to work out.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.440
- Oh, yeah.
- Maybe you should talk to someone.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.520
I thought I was.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.480
- Colonel!
- Carter.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.240
- Coffee.
- Talk to you later, OK?

06:01.600 --> 06:04.280
(humming "Stargate" theme)

06:09.520 --> 06:11.640
Humming?

06:11.720 --> 06:13.600
- I am?
- You are.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.520
Sorry.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.280
What's his name?
Humming.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.000
Pete. Pete Shanahan.
He's a cop.

06:29.080 --> 06:33.120
- Speeding again, are we?
- From Denver. A friend of my brother's.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.080
- A setup.
- Pathetic, I know.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.520
No, it's great.
Isn't it?

06:37.600 --> 06:40.320
Well, it's not serious or anything.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.480
And yet it is humworthy.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.440
- Sir...
- It's none of my business.

06:46.520 --> 06:52.120
I'm just happy you're happy about
something other than... quarks.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.600
- Not bad with the quarks, huh?
- Excellent.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.160
- Bit uncomfortable, isn't it?
- Yeah, a bit.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.640
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.200
Good morning.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.280
Hm? Hello.

08:07.360 --> 08:11.480
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you come in.
I mean, how are you?

08:11.560 --> 08:13.720
- Fine.
- You settling in?

08:13.800 --> 08:17.880
Well, except for want of
a decent cup of tea, I'm in heaven.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.920
That's good to hear.

08:22.400 --> 08:26.880
You know, I must have read
everything you've ever published.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.800
- Everything?
- Yes.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.720
What a waste of time.

08:33.799 --> 08:37.200
Please! Your theories on the Hyksos
dynasty are groundbreaking -

08:37.280 --> 08:39.280
if a little audacious.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.760
I found them inspiring. I referenced them
in my doctoral thesis at Cambridge.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.240
You must have failed.

08:48.640 --> 08:52.120
I just hope I can live up
to such talented company.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.800
No, I'm sure if you're here,
you have... you are.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.960
Stop. The flattery is overwhelming.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.560
- I should let you continue.
- I'm gonna continue.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.640
You know, I know this good place
for coffee that...

09:19.720 --> 09:22.040
No, I mean, I'm sure they serve tea.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.960
- I'd like that, Dr Jackson.
- Daniel.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
Daniel.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.760
I can't tell you how much I've looked
forward to being here with you,

09:34.840 --> 09:37.280
being able to pick your brain and...

10:00.840 --> 10:02.840
(pants)

10:10.920 --> 10:14.080
- That was great.
- Yeah, it was OK.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.280
I mean, the company was fine.

10:16.360 --> 10:19.400
Oh, come on, how can you not like
Singin' in the Rain?

10:19.480 --> 10:22.000
I've always been
more of a Fred Astaire fan.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.000
- It's a classic.
- Whoa! Whoa there, lady.

10:25.080 --> 10:29.840
"Classic" is reserved for the likes of The
French Connection, Dirty Harry, Serpico.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.600
- Cop movies.
- What's your point?

10:32.680 --> 10:36.840
- This was romantic.
- Watching a man dance in the rain?

10:36.920 --> 10:40.760
- Just cos there's no guns or car chases...
- Or nudity.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.960
Your chances of that
are slim to none now, buddy.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.960
Have I ever told you
what a good dancer I am?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.760
My case down here wraps up tomorrow.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.920
You're heading back to Denver?

10:54.000 --> 10:59.560
I called my captain and said "I don't care
if crime is running rampant up there,

10:59.640 --> 11:02.840
I met this woman, this amazing person,

11:03.720 --> 11:06.000
and we got this thing goin' on."

11:07.120 --> 11:11.400
- And what did he say?
- "Get your ass back here or you're fired."

11:12.080 --> 11:14.520
- Too bad.
- I'm lying.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.960
I told him
I'm taking two weeks' vacation.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.840
The truth is, Colorado Springs is very...

11:24.360 --> 11:26.360
underrated.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.240
Pete.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.120
- And it was going so well.
- It is.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.080
But?

11:42.000 --> 11:45.080
- It's getting late.
- It's seven o'clock.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.760
I have to get up really early.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.160
- To go to work.
- Right.

11:51.320 --> 11:56.040
Which involves long, arduous hours
of you looking into a telescope.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.400
Right.

11:58.480 --> 12:03.080
Sam... have I mentioned I'm a cop?
I interrogate people for a living.

12:03.160 --> 12:06.120
Are you saying you don't believe me?

12:06.200 --> 12:09.880
Is this all going too fast for you?
Cos I could back off.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.440
- Give you five or ten minutes?
- (laughs)

12:20.720 --> 12:22.720
I'll call you.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.400
- Have I left yet?
- (laughs)

12:27.480 --> 12:29.600
I can't feel my legs.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.560
- Thank you.
- A little human contact first, if you please.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.200
- Was that so hard?
- Mmm.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.280
I'll live.

13:03.360 --> 13:08.200
- You've been here all night, haven't you?
- Is it morning already?

13:08.280 --> 13:10.560
I've got something for you.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.720
Where'd you get this?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.760
It was found during
an expedition in Morocco.

13:22.840 --> 13:27.800
An associate sent it to me for analysis.
No one's quite sure what to make of it.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.520
I took the liberty
of running a carbon dating.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.080
It's over 10,000 years old.

13:34.520 --> 13:38.400
- That's impossible.
- The lack of writing in the pyramids,

13:38.480 --> 13:41.280
the inconclusive dating
on several artefacts...

13:41.360 --> 13:46.280
Are you saying this proves there existed a
language that predates all hieroglyphics?

13:46.360 --> 13:49.280
I thought you might enjoy the challenge.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.960
Daniel?

13:57.040 --> 14:00.880
- I recognise this.
- How could you?

14:00.960 --> 14:05.440
Medieval Latin is a derivative.
We can use it as a reference point.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.280
Daniel, how could you
possibly know that?

14:08.360 --> 14:10.520
I don't know.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.600
I just do.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.280
This makes no sense.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.040
Maybe you should eat something.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.760
In the dream
the tablet was written in Ancient,

14:36.840 --> 14:38.880
and in the dream I could read Ancient.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.880
That's not so odd, considering you can
also do that when you're awake.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.680
Perhaps you want to
reveal something to yourself.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.240
- Like?
- From when you were ascended.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.960
Your prior vision
of Bra'tac and Rya'c in danger.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.080
The tablet sounds a lot like
the one you found on Abydos.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.520
- That was to lead to the Lost City.
- But didn't.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.320
You think I know the location
of the Lost City and I don't remember?

15:01.400 --> 15:05.800
If you have the dream again,
perhaps you should translate the tablet.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.000
I thought you might need a break.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.920
Wow.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.200
That's really nice. I mean...

15:27.040 --> 15:29.880
- I don't really deserve you, do I?
- No.

15:30.960 --> 15:35.000
- Hungry?
- I can't remember the last time I ate.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.600
- How's it going?
- I'm so close.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.600
I think I found a basic structure
to the whole thing.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.680
It's about guidance.

15:42.760 --> 15:47.920
At first I thought that meant some sort of
spiritual guidance, but I was wrong. Here.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.920
Look.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.840
Something about
a starting point or place of origin.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.920
The steps of a great journey leading to...

16:02.000 --> 16:04.920
What? Leading to what?

16:05.760 --> 16:09.560
A city. A place of great power.

16:11.640 --> 16:16.880
It's a map, telling us how to find a city
where an ancient race of humans lived.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.319
See, I know what the tablet
is supposed to say,

17:17.400 --> 17:20.839
I just can't seem to finish translating it.

17:25.040 --> 17:30.360
Perhaps the location of the Lost City was
not the answer you were searching for.

17:30.440 --> 17:34.600
Since I now require sleep,
I have developed an interest in dreams.

17:34.680 --> 17:38.480
There is much research to study
on the matter.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.480
OK, Sigmund,
what are my dreams about?

17:46.480 --> 17:51.600
Since Sarah was taken as a host by Osiris,
you have been unable to save her.

17:51.680 --> 17:56.240
Perhaps that is the focus
of your subconscious desires.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.920
Something I knew
when I was ascended could help?

17:59.000 --> 18:03.120
Dreams are the mind's way of dealing
with desires that cannot be fulfilled.

18:03.200 --> 18:08.040
Oh. So basically I'm destined
never to get a good night's sleep again.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.200
Knowing your past experiences,
Daniel Jackson,

18:11.280 --> 18:14.960
I do not know how
you have slept well before now.

18:15.040 --> 18:20.320
Thank you, Teal'c. This conversation
has been disturbing on many levels.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.320
- Up enough?
- I, uh...

19:03.840 --> 19:05.960
What?

19:06.040 --> 19:08.520
I'll take that as a yes.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.120
- Are those for me?
- Yeah.

19:13.480 --> 19:17.800
It's the other 11.
The one I left before makes a dozen.

19:17.880 --> 19:21.000
I get it.
They're beautiful. Thank you.

19:30.280 --> 19:33.520
- Can I open them now?
- No.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.280
- Now?
- No! Will you stop?

19:37.360 --> 19:39.360
- How about now?
- No.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.440
OK, now.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.160
(* band plays swing)

19:53.560 --> 19:57.760
- What do you think?
- I think we're gonna get noticed.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.840
(Pete) Come on.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.400
(* slow jazz)

20:30.120 --> 20:32.480
This is great.

20:32.560 --> 20:38.360
It's nice to know people still stay together
no matter what. Isn't it?

20:58.120 --> 21:00.240
- I can't do this.
- What's the matter?

21:00.320 --> 21:02.360
I'm just going round in circles.

21:02.440 --> 21:06.240
I can't find any references
that relate to this passage.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.400
- Doorways?
- What?

21:09.480 --> 21:11.600
The origin of doorways.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.720
- How do you know that?
- It makes sense, doesn't it?

21:14.800 --> 21:18.760
- Yeah, but how do you know that?
- It's all there.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.840
You just need to relax.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.600
- Mm! Oh, no.
- What?

21:27.680 --> 21:31.520
We were supposed to have dinner tonight.
Two months, right?

21:31.600 --> 21:34.160
I'm so sorry, I forgot.
Why didn't you remind me?

21:34.240 --> 21:37.000
- It's all right.
- It's too late now.

21:37.080 --> 21:41.360
I understand. If it was that important
to me, I would have said something.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.360
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.

21:45.520 --> 21:48.640
You're supposed to leave.

21:48.720 --> 21:52.120
What are you talking about?
I'm not going anywhere.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.600
Your research will change the world.
You're a brilliant mind.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.360
I don't want to stand in the way of that.
I want to be a part of it.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.920
I am, however, going to order us pizza.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.000
Get back to work.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.960
So, do you wanna come in?

22:16.040 --> 22:21.040
I don't know. Seeing the inside
of your house, that's a pretty big step.

22:21.120 --> 22:25.560
- Suit yourself.
- Right now, you're pretty much perfect.

22:26.560 --> 22:30.880
What if it turns out
you're really messy, or worse,

22:30.960 --> 22:36.200
you're a neat-freak weirdo with labelled
drawers and an alphabetised bookshelf?

22:36.280 --> 22:38.280
Pff.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.240
OK, I'm coming!

23:04.720 --> 23:06.160
Wow.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.520
- Just don't look at the bookshelf.
- OK.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.120
So why'd you become a cop?

23:22.200 --> 23:24.560
I watched too much TV as a kid.

23:25.560 --> 23:28.840
Adam-12, Starsky and Hutch,
Barney Miller.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.800
- Barney Miller?
- It was my favourite show.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.880
Those guys never shot anybody,
never beat anybody up.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.040
That's it?

23:40.120 --> 23:43.760
What do you think? Every cop out there
has an inspirational story?

23:43.840 --> 23:45.840
It's just a job, Sam.

23:46.840 --> 23:49.560
I don't think so. Not for you.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.160
And Mark told me you had a story.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.600
Bastard!

23:57.680 --> 24:01.400
- Never date your buddy's sister.
- He didn't tell me what it was.

24:01.480 --> 24:05.600
It's no big deal. I... had a bit of
a rough time when I was growing up.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Truth is,

24:12.320 --> 24:18.320
I probably would have ended up in jail if
it wasn't for one cop who took an interest.

24:19.480 --> 24:23.840
He really made a difference in my life,
and I admired that.

24:24.760 --> 24:28.520
- It's an admirable job.
- Well, my ex-wife didn't think so.

24:30.160 --> 24:34.000
Did you see the episode where Barney
gets home and his stuff is on the lawn,

24:34.080 --> 24:37.080
- with divorce papers stapled on top?
- No.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.240
I didn't blame her.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.960
I mean, the hours suck
and you never know if...

24:46.760 --> 24:49.120
I didn't have a choice.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.840
It's who I am.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.640
- I can understand that.
- Really?

24:58.200 --> 25:03.360
- Deep-space telemetry is who you are?
- I wish I could tell you more.

25:03.880 --> 25:07.880
- You don't trust me.
- I'm not allowed.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.200
Where are you going?

25:15.400 --> 25:18.400
I gotta drive back to Denver today
and file my report.

25:18.480 --> 25:23.600
Pete... aside from getting
into huge trouble myself,

25:23.680 --> 25:25.840
I could be putting you in danger.

25:25.920 --> 25:30.760
Now you're telling me that joke about your
boyfriends all ending up dead is true?

25:30.840 --> 25:32.720
Pete, please.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.400
The problem is, I feel like I've just
scratched the surface with you, Sam.

25:42.080 --> 25:47.760
How can we have a future together
if you won't share your life with me?

26:23.320 --> 26:25.320
(dialling cellphone)

26:28.320 --> 26:31.640
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
How may I direct your call?

26:31.720 --> 26:36.560
- Special Agent Farrity, please.
- I'll transfer you now. Please hold.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.640
(rings)

26:40.320 --> 26:42.080
- Farrity.
- Dave, it's Pete.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.840
What's up, buddy?

26:44.440 --> 26:48.960
I'm in Colorado Springs on a case
right now and I need a favour, man.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.160
Can you do a background check
on someone?

26:51.240 --> 26:55.680
- Global agency search, the works?
- Sure thing. Who is it?

26:55.760 --> 26:58.400
An air-force major.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.480
Samantha Carter.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.920
The only thing I don't have
is a gate address,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.880
and there are still a few passages
I can't translate.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.360
- Do you think you can?
- I don't know.

27:17.440 --> 27:22.280
It's like I'm not in control,
like I'm just along for the ride,

27:22.360 --> 27:24.960
watching the whole thing unfold.

27:25.040 --> 27:31.280
- The strange thing is, none of it's right.
- Please elaborate, Daniel Jackson.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.360
I was an idiot.

27:33.440 --> 27:37.800
Sarah was in love with me
and I had feelings for her too, but...

27:37.880 --> 27:42.040
my obsession with my research
destroyed our relationship.

27:42.120 --> 27:47.280
She finally broke it off with me
when I worked through our anniversary.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.400
The Sarah I'm dreaming about is different.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.840
She cares about my work
as much as I do.

27:53.920 --> 27:57.080
She wants me to find the Lost City
as much as I do.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.640
Sounds like a normal male fantasy to me.

27:59.720 --> 28:03.840
Did you not say that Sarah introduced the
tablet to you during one of the dreams?

28:03.920 --> 28:07.000
And that you feel that
you have no control of the dreams?

28:07.080 --> 28:09.200
- Yeah.
- Teal'c?

28:10.720 --> 28:15.760
The Goa'uld possess the technology
to explore one's memory.

28:17.160 --> 28:21.360
You're suggesting Osiris is here on Earth,
manipulating Dr Jackson's dreams?

28:21.440 --> 28:24.400
- We think it's possible, sir.
- Kinky!

28:24.480 --> 28:28.640
She's looking for the location
of the Lost City in my subconscious.

28:28.720 --> 28:32.000
She's implanted an image
of an Ancient tablet to help me.

28:32.080 --> 28:36.480
Osiris can access Sarah's memories and
use them to gain Daniel Jackson's trust.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.160
- How's she doing it?
- We're speculating that

28:39.240 --> 28:43.040
she's sneaking into Daniel's house
at night and using a memory device.

28:43.120 --> 28:47.640
Anubis probed Thor's mind, thus gaining
access to Asgard beaming technology.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.240
(Daniel) That'd allow her
to come and go undetected.

28:50.320 --> 28:55.560
Why not just snatch up Dr Jackson and
use a mind probe on him, like with Thor?

28:55.640 --> 28:59.120
It's possible Anubis's mind probe
won't work on the subconscious.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.320
It might have something to do
with how Oma erased my memories.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.960
It may be a way to get you to unknowingly
help them learn what they wish to know.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.720
So what do we do?

29:09.800 --> 29:12.480
(Teal'c) The Goa'uld
are scavengers of alien technology.

29:12.560 --> 29:16.160
They would interface any Asgard system
with their own command device.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.800
We hope the jamming device
could prevent Osiris

29:18.880 --> 29:21.680
from using the beam technology
to escape Daniel's room.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.000
- You want to set up a trap.
- We won't spring it

29:24.080 --> 29:27.840
until after she's helped me remember
the location of the Lost City.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.320
What?!

29:30.400 --> 29:35.360
Look, no one wants to save Sarah
more than I do, but... I could know.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.880
I mean, it could be there.
Somewhere in my subconscious.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.760
We let her think she's operating
without our knowledge

29:42.840 --> 29:45.240
until I've had a chance
to try to finish this.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.360
And how are we supposed to know
when you know,

29:48.440 --> 29:52.000
if it's all happening in your head
while you're sleeping?

29:55.200 --> 29:58.680
- I don't know.
- (Hammond) You'd better figure it out.

29:58.760 --> 30:04.160
We can't risk letting Osiris escape
with that kind of information.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.640
(cellphone ringing)

30:06.720 --> 30:10.600
- Shanahan.
- It's me. I got what you wanted.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.920
- Just give me the highlights.
- Well, there's a lot of backstop ID.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.200
Works for the air force,
does deep-space telemetry for NORAD.

30:18.280 --> 30:21.800
- Is that all you found?
- It's what didn't turn up that says most.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.040
The backstop dead-ends.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.120
- She's been scrubbed?
- Yeah.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.760
Someone wiped out
every possible trace of her.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.520
Left only what they want others to see.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.560
She's probably connected
with some top-level stuff.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.760
- Like?
- Black ops, covert units.

30:37.840 --> 30:41.200
Things the government denies
all knowledge of, you know?

30:41.280 --> 30:45.880
Look, Pete, you ask me, this Major
Carter's connected to something big.

30:45.960 --> 30:50.320
You might want to back off from this one,
OK, buddy? It's way out of your league.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.640
It's not like I'm dating her or anything.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.840
Right.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.040
(ringing tone)

31:31.120 --> 31:32.520
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.760
This is Pete. I'm probably chasing
a bad guy. Leave a message.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.960
So what do we got?

31:42.040 --> 31:45.240
Daniel's at his house,
setting up video surveillance.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.840
Teal'c's picking out his doughnuts.

31:47.920 --> 31:51.120
He loves a good stakeout.

31:51.200 --> 31:55.600
Jamming device is in the van. It should
prevent Osiris from beaming herself out.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.640
- We take her down with these?
- She likely has a shield,

31:58.720 --> 32:00.960
but a tranquilliser dart will get through.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.680
Then we hope the Tok'ra can safely
remove the symbiote and save Sarah.

32:04.760 --> 32:09.960
- What about this whole Lost City deal?
- We watch and see.

32:10.040 --> 32:12.600
Once in his room,
Osiris won't be able to leave.

32:12.680 --> 32:16.320
We just have to get to her
before she realises she's been made.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.560
- Backup?
- Local authorities have been "notified".

32:19.640 --> 32:23.040
But we don't want to do anything
to alert Osiris.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.320
How's Pete?

32:29.280 --> 32:31.280
You know how it is.

32:32.240 --> 32:37.880
Usually you don't let it bother you, cos
they couldn't cope with the truth anyway.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.040
Usually.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.960
I think he could have.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.360
Hey, Daniel.

33:07.840 --> 33:10.360
Daniel, are you sleeping yet?

33:10.440 --> 33:13.120
Yes, Jack, I'm fast asleep.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.720
What do you got there?

33:46.880 --> 33:49.480
No. I'll pass.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.360
Here we go.

34:02.080 --> 34:05.000
Activating frequency jamming.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.120
Let's do it.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.680
- Carter?
- She's still there, sir.

34:59.760 --> 35:04.040
- How long do we wait?
- Daniel must be getting close.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.560
- Progress?
- Not really.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.760
These symbols represent
the location of the city.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.920
- Like an address?
- Yeah.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.360
Yeah, there's seven of them. They won't
translate into anything specific.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.280
- You're so close.
- No, I am not.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.360
Don't say that, Daniel.

35:40.280 --> 35:45.040
- They mean nothing to me.
- You've worked too hard to give up now.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.120
I don't know.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.760
I never knew.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.640
(Osiris) How unfortunate for you.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.840
Move in! Move in!

36:33.320 --> 36:36.040
- Sam.
- Pete, what are you...

36:36.120 --> 36:38.360
Get down!

36:46.000 --> 36:47.720
Holy...

36:52.880 --> 36:54.840
Agh!

36:54.920 --> 36:59.720
- Will you be all right, Daniel Jackson?
- Yeah. Go, go, go.

37:07.720 --> 37:10.600
- It's no use, Pete!
- Yeah, why is that?

37:19.040 --> 37:21.040
Now that is not normal.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.040
Look out!

37:32.280 --> 37:34.280
(dart is fired)

37:52.480 --> 37:54.480
(O'Neill) Clear!

37:56.360 --> 37:58.720
- Are you OK?
- I'm OK.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.800
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.800
That's good.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.640
Oh, God. Pete, you've been hit.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.440
Have I?

38:15.320 --> 38:19.600
- Carter?
- It's Pete. He needs an ambulance.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.800
Just hang in there, OK?

38:24.880 --> 38:28.760
Sam... what just happened?

38:29.160 --> 38:32.960
I promise, if you make it through this,
I will explain everything.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.280
Deal.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.560
(machines bleeping)

38:57.240 --> 38:59.480
It's all right, you're safe.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.880
- Daniel?
- I'm here.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.480
It's all over.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.880
You're free.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.960
- I'm so sorry.
- Shh.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.240
It's not your fault.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.400
I couldn't stop it.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.320
We're gonna get you through this.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.520
Hey.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.400
- Are they treating you OK?
- Yeah.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.800
Who'd have thought
there was a hospital here?

39:37.880 --> 39:41.320
- One of the best anywhere.
- This place is unbelievable.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.960
You have no idea.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.480
Thanks.

40:09.760 --> 40:13.360
I believe I lived up
to my end of the bargain.

40:15.640 --> 40:18.000
What I'm about to tell you is classified

40:18.080 --> 40:21.640
under section 11-C-9
of the National Security Act.

40:21.720 --> 40:26.920
Chicks with laser-beam rings and
glowing eyes are classified under 11-C-9?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.800
- Let me talk, will you?
- OK.

40:29.880 --> 40:35.240
You're currently in a top-secret military
facility known as Stargate Command.

40:35.320 --> 40:39.280
In 1928 in Giza, Egypt, archaeologists
unearthed an ancient device
