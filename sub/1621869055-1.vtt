WEBVTT

01:50.068 --> 01:52.771
- 1900 hours, cruising as before.

01:53.822 --> 01:58.827
1900 hours,
cruising as before, so noted.

02:00.995 --> 02:01.995
- Evening,

02:03.164 --> 02:04.824
anything interesting?

02:04.874 --> 02:07.210
- Just keeping an eye on our course.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.337
Marcus has me as acting navigator

02:09.379 --> 02:11.381
since we ended up shorthanded.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.583
- How about young Royce,

02:13.633 --> 02:14.759
how's he doing?

02:15.885 --> 02:17.470
- Well enough.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.423
You know, it's morning
back home right now.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.174
- Homesick?

02:21.224 --> 02:22.392
- Of course not,

02:23.351 --> 02:24.636
- I do loathe children.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.513
That bad?

02:26.563 --> 02:28.723
- He needs some discipline
kicked into him.

02:28.773 --> 02:29.773
But I'll admit,

02:29.816 --> 02:30.600
it will be nice to have

02:30.650 --> 02:32.169
a dedicated electronic warfare specialist

02:32.193 --> 02:32.977
with us this time.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.647
Conn, SepMOD.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.781
- Conn, aye.

02:38.032 --> 02:41.111
- Strobing contact bearing 040 by 022.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.114
Distance approximately
2.5 million Ahrimans.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.323
- ID?

02:45.373 --> 02:47.826
It looked clean
until about 15 seconds ago.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.994
Now I'm getting flashes
of a scrambled signal.

02:50.044 --> 02:52.664
She looks to pass close at
present course and speed

02:52.714 --> 02:55.592
about 1,100 Ahrimans off our
starboard side, high to low.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.211
Mr. Barrows?

02:58.261 --> 02:59.921
- Mr. Masterson?

02:59.971 --> 03:01.756
- Shall we go to quarters?

03:01.806 --> 03:04.634
- Well, that's the kind of
decision you were hired to make.

03:04.684 --> 03:05.468
- Sir?

03:05.518 --> 03:06.469
- Choice is yours.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.222
Have it sounded or call
the captain and ask him.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.666
- Abner, I'm the XO, I should really...

03:10.690 --> 03:12.642
- No, you really shouldn't.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.836
Give him a chance to earn his pay.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.478
Conn SepMOD,

03:15.528 --> 03:17.355
contact confirmed as blacklisted ship.

03:17.405 --> 03:20.275
We have full legal authority
to destroy or seize.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.493
Designating contact as 'Target One.'

03:25.371 --> 03:26.623
- Time's wasting mister.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.868
- Sound general quarters,

03:29.918 --> 03:31.369
all hands to battle stations.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.403
- Abner, he really should
have deferred to me

03:39.427 --> 03:42.847
after all I am the executive
officer of this ship.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.645
- Of course, you're absolutely right.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.768
- Magazines manned and ready.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.896
- Hydra One mount
reports manned and ready.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.606
- Cobra mount reports manned and ready.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.065
- Hydra Two manned and ready.

04:01.115 --> 04:02.734
- Quad mount reports manned and ready.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.569
- Hydra Twin mount
reports manned and ready.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.571
- All guns manned and ready.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.616
- What's happening?

04:09.666 --> 04:10.867
Why are we at the quarters?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.493
- New contact Captain,

04:12.543 --> 04:13.646
high on the bow to starboard.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.921
It's blacklisted.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.508
- Why was I informed by
the alarms instead of you?

04:19.384 --> 04:20.501
- I considered...

04:20.551 --> 04:21.844
- Then why didn't you?

04:24.347 --> 04:25.965
We'll talk about this later.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.051
I have the Conn, threat board on one.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.454
Combat condition,

04:30.478 --> 04:32.013
sealing pressure doors.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.060
- She'll pass right abeam of us.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.020
- Couldn't ask for a better setup.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.022
- SepMOD, distance to target.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.132
Contact has closed distance

04:42.156 --> 04:43.191
to 2 million Ahrimans.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.985
Speed is constant at 200,000 APH.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.403
- She's drifting.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.030
Trying to sneak through undetected.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.282
- Who generated the blacklist warrant?

04:51.332 --> 04:52.434
The Arkwright family.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.333
- The Arkwrights?

05:00.383 --> 05:02.677
We're collecting bounties
for those beasts?

05:04.095 --> 05:05.805
- Keep those thoughts to yourself.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.842
If you need a reason this
means serious prize money.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.728
- Maneuvering, Conn.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.273
Bring the reactor to 100%.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.234
Stand by to commence
flank speed operations.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.944
- Max output, aye.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.697
Reactors one and two, latch
the rods and lift to the stops.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.365
- Aye, sir, latching and lifting.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.793
- We could try pushing her a little bit.

05:43.843 --> 05:44.627
- Not this time,

05:44.677 --> 05:46.971
let's see how she handles
ordinary combat first.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.757
- Helm, correct course and angle

05:49.807 --> 05:51.384
to match the target.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.802
And prepare to reverse.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.762
- Aye, sir, adjusting course.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.319
- Contact has closed distance
to 1.4 million Ahrimans.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.988
Stand by... confirmed classification,

06:12.038 --> 06:13.906
Bolton Class freighter.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.750
Looks like she's even older than we are.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.704
- Focus on your jobs, please.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.080
Let's not have her getting away.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.133
Target course matched.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.210
- All back standard.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.137
- Aye, sir, all back standard.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.434
- Nice and smooth.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.186
- Just like my dad's clipper.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.312
- Burn up 20%.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.605
Burn up 20%, aye.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.799
Contact approaching steady.

06:52.453 --> 06:53.237
- After this patrol,

06:53.287 --> 06:55.206
you should come on another trip with us.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.040
- Um...

06:57.125 --> 06:58.227
Yeah, that sounds nice

06:58.251 --> 06:59.994
but this freighter won't catch itself.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.063
What's she doing?

07:01.087 --> 07:02.687
She should be trying to evade us by now.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.691
Captain, target
has increased speed

07:04.715 --> 07:07.126
to 201,000 APH and is accelerating.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.461
- She's gunning it, Marcus!

07:08.511 --> 07:10.129
- All hands brace.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.179
Flank reverse!

07:18.563 --> 07:20.723
Don't call me by first
name in front of the men.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.518
Captain, target
one is veering to starboard.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.895
- Cut burn to 80%.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.647
Full burn on port,

07:27.697 --> 07:31.734
three quarters on starboard
bow tips for 15 seconds.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.918
Comms, transmit a desist
order and identify us.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.345
Cobra mount, prepare a
warning shot over her bow.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.925
Chief, the threat board just went out.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.385
- Recycling the input, sir.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.595
Conn, Target
One is slowing down now.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.597
Attention all passengers,

08:01.647 --> 08:03.641
the new year has arrived!

08:03.691 --> 08:06.894
The party is in full swing on C deck!

08:06.944 --> 08:08.354
Where are you?

08:08.404 --> 08:10.440
Get on down and join the celebration!

08:10.490 --> 08:11.274
- What is that?

08:11.324 --> 08:12.567
Who is playing that?

08:12.617 --> 08:13.677
- I'm sorry Captain it's...

08:13.701 --> 08:14.485
- What are you doing?

08:14.535 --> 08:16.112
- It's part of an old system.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.197
A virtual personality for tourists.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.198
Her name's Claire,

08:19.248 --> 08:21.284
some of our components
were purchased second hand

08:21.334 --> 08:22.710
off of an old cruise liner.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.996
- We encountered her
during the shakedown run.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.748
Captain Timmons had all
of her code removed.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.959
I don't see how she can
still be functioning.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.210
Stars and garters,

08:31.260 --> 08:33.880
have we got the event of a
lifetime lined up for you!

08:33.930 --> 08:36.382
Captain, target slowing further.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.600
- Shut her up.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.137
- Marc... Captain I think
he's trying to back down

08:41.187 --> 08:42.388
and run the other way.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.689
- Shut her OFF!

08:45.525 --> 08:46.851
Fire the warning shot!

08:46.901 --> 08:47.901
- Cobra mount, fire!

08:51.155 --> 08:52.591
No change in target course.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.651
- All hands brace, reverse thrust.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.701
All ahead one quarter.

08:56.744 --> 08:57.528
Aye, sir.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.843
- Mr. Saverin, please
prepare to disable her.

09:14.595 --> 09:15.755
Fire at her with, uh,

09:15.805 --> 09:17.465
I think half shots will do the trick.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.139
- All guns target her forward engines.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.974
Hydra One, load half shots.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.185
- Comms, any acknowledgement yet?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.295
- It's a little funny, Captain.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.021
We may have just heard a channel open,

09:32.071 --> 09:34.649
then close again, nothing further.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.152
- Very well, disable
her please Mr Saverin.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.612
- Hydra One, fire.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.738
- Fire.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.451
- Weapon missed, leading target.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.452
Adjust to minus 4.

09:46.502 --> 09:47.787
- Adjust and fire.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.210
- Adjust and fire.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.212
- Adjusting minus 4, firing!

10:01.183 --> 10:02.134
- Hit, Captain.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.845
- Confirmed, target's forward
engines appear to be disabled.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.347
She's spinning free.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.349
- Helm, cease forward thrust,

10:08.399 --> 10:09.934
burn reverse at one quarter.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.311
25 second burn,

10:12.361 --> 10:13.396
bring us alongside,

10:13.446 --> 10:15.606
we'll extend the MAG at 1,000 yards.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.566
Call it out Foley.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.733
Aye sir.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.277
- Mr. Royce, can we open their doors

10:19.327 --> 10:20.971
or do we have to do this
the old fashioned way?

10:20.995 --> 10:22.238
- It should be easy sir.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.782
They're shutting down
their communication systems

10:24.832 --> 10:26.518
like they think I'm gonna
hack them through that.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.494
They should be worried about the keyring.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.370
- Do we have a key?

10:29.420 --> 10:31.664
- I'm checking now, sir,
but it's gonna take a while.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.873
- You don't have a while.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.001
Helm, continue your approach.

10:35.051 --> 10:35.918
Let's get into position.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.112
This needs to be handled quickly.

10:37.970 --> 10:38.713
1,000 yards.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.797
Devil's distance captain.

10:39.847 --> 10:40.756
- Deploy the MAG.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.807
- Her rotation is slowing,

10:49.857 --> 10:51.192
she's dragging us with her.

11:05.122 --> 11:05.948
Five,

11:05.998 --> 11:06.998
four,

11:07.041 --> 11:07.825
three,

11:07.875 --> 11:08.951
two,

11:09.001 --> 11:09.785
one,

11:09.835 --> 11:11.537
- synchro.

11:11.587 --> 11:12.872
- Burn all tips to starboard.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.123
Reel us in.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.255
Extend the lock.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.142
Prepare a boarding action and take charge.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.602
- Aye, Captain.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.263
All compartments prepare
for boarding action.

11:29.313 --> 11:32.558
Mr. Merchov, assemble
your men at Airlock 4.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.319
- Best of luck, Tom.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.073
- You too... Marcus.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.519
Target One is fighting the MAG.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.786
- Royce, key?

11:51.836 --> 11:52.912
- Yeah, I've got it!

11:52.962 --> 11:53.962
For a second there,

11:54.004 --> 11:55.482
I thought I'd have to magic one up...

11:55.506 --> 11:56.757
- Are we ready to breach?

11:57.633 --> 11:58.633
- Yes, sir.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.464
- All right boys,

12:03.514 --> 12:04.840
this is your first engagement.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.801
Remember your training
and put it into practice.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.994
Prepare to take your first trophies.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.104
Taham tan zanam!

12:10.396 --> 12:11.415
- Just stay where you are Mr. Hess,

12:11.439 --> 12:13.140
we've got this in hand.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.501
- The captain told me to take charge.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.769
- It's a mop up, not worth your attention.

12:16.819 --> 12:17.728
- I have my orders.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.067
- Very well, sir.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.195
Pressurizing the walkway!

12:26.245 --> 12:27.029
Var Shaw!

12:31.500 --> 12:33.311
They've
dispersed through the air lock.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.255
Advancing towards the
bridge, Merchov commanding.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.690
Hamlin's fire team moving aft.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.382
Baldwin taking the crew quarters.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.461
Hamlin reports engineering secured,

12:42.511 --> 12:44.255
all hands in the space have surrendered.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.324
No resistance encountered
yet,  wait.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.178
Be advised, Baldwin has
encountered token resistance

12:51.228 --> 12:52.388
in the crew areas.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.939
Hamlin moving to assist.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.100
Nearing the bridge,

12:56.150 --> 12:57.401
approaching with caution.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.816
Anyone else see that...?

13:06.410 --> 13:07.995
Resistance at the bridge, two men down!

13:15.336 --> 13:17.588
Surrender!

13:18.255 --> 13:19.799
Surrender...

13:21.133 --> 13:23.260
One moment sir...

13:25.554 --> 13:27.631
Ship secure
captain, she's ours.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.175
- YEAH!

13:35.731 --> 13:38.559
- That's one prize to us.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.394
Link us up, we'll do a tandem brake.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.395
Take a manifest.

13:41.445 --> 13:42.696
I'll be up there shortly.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.950
Well done, XO.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.082
- Well done, XO.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.677
- Foodstuffs, indeed!

14:13.727 --> 14:16.355
He's got enough weapons
back there to take Brasilia.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.809
Arms for the war on Perkunas, maybe?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.185
- Doesn't matter.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.270
These boys picked a fight
with the wrong oligarchs.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.148
- Wouldn't it be something if
these weapons were legitimate?

14:26.198 --> 14:28.025
I mean, I wouldn't put
it past the Arkwrights

14:28.075 --> 14:29.693
to file a false claim.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.403
- Odds are they're stolen.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.696
They're from Hoplon Arms

14:32.746 --> 14:34.490
and if you notice
somebody had a little fun

14:34.540 --> 14:35.866
with the serial numbers.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.409
- How do you know it's Hoplon?

14:37.459 --> 14:38.244
- I almost bought from them

14:38.294 --> 14:40.329
when we were outfitting our own marines.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.379
Good value for money

14:41.422 --> 14:43.624
but unfortunately their
Yankee founder won't have

14:43.674 --> 14:45.793
any business with independent colonials.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.087
- Your scholar's memory
serves us well, Captain.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.447
- You should have seen him in school,

14:49.471 --> 14:52.174
he could recite books from front to back.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.802
- Captain, Arkwright
vessel "Peerless Diligence"

14:54.852 --> 14:57.354
is alongside requesting clearance to dock.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.473
- Granted.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.739
- So, are we sticking around?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.693
- Make my apologies to
their commander personally,

15:10.743 --> 15:13.654
after that, get all of
our men off this ship.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.497
I want to be out of here
as soon as possible.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.687
- Why did you let Masterson
take us to quarters

15:46.737 --> 15:48.272
without informing me?

15:48.322 --> 15:50.149
- It's a standard practice.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.718
He and the crew need to learn their jobs

15:51.742 --> 15:53.277
and how to work together.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.653
And how to work with the ship.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.614
- You put this crew together Abner,

15:56.664 --> 15:59.199
and now you're telling us
they still need an education?

15:59.249 --> 16:00.117
- Tom...

16:00.167 --> 16:02.328
- It's quite all right, sir.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.205
I did the best I could with
the budget you gave me.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.791
Yes, I personally know
several of the officers,

16:07.841 --> 16:10.803
but they don't all know each
other and they don't know you.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.490
Young greenhorns like
Masterson still need a chance

16:13.514 --> 16:15.424
to make up their own minds under pressure.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.884
- I understand.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.553
But I must insist on
being kept in the loop.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.679
- Of course.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.749
But your fire control officer
doesn't need your help

16:22.773 --> 16:23.974
to do his job.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.518
- It seemed like the
right thing in the moment.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.896
- Well that's why your
father sent me along,

16:28.946 --> 16:30.230
to advise you, sir.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.483
- And what exactly does
that mean, in practice?

16:32.533 --> 16:35.069
You stopped me from
giving Masterson an order;

16:35.119 --> 16:37.821
that's a good deal more
than mere advice...

16:37.871 --> 16:40.908
- It was an order you didn't
need to give but don't worry.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.644
I'll make sure you both
get back home quickly

16:42.668 --> 16:44.244
and in one piece.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.079
That's my job.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.622
- Your point is taken, Abner.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.549
And we'll work on this going forward.

16:50.551 --> 16:54.096
You know what's getting to
me is that... that voice.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.491
I understand that the ship's components

16:56.515 --> 16:58.892
came from unusual places, but...

16:59.143 --> 17:00.803
We can't have that.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.888
It's an embarrassment and it's dangerous.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.723
- Young Royce is weeding
her out as we speak.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.892
- Has he started his qualification course?

17:06.942 --> 17:10.104
I want every officer to
be able to stand watch.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.855
- If I may make a suggestion, captain,

17:11.905 --> 17:13.699
you might focus on today's victory.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.344
Today's prize is worth a fair penny,

17:16.368 --> 17:18.904
and we bagged it right out of the gate.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.833
And... it was an excellent
learning experience.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.288
- Oh, that guy.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.841
I don't even know why we
have to have him with us.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.848
- To a fine start.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.147
- I can hardly believe it.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.181
- Believe what?

17:46.231 --> 17:48.475
- What we just did. What you just did!

17:48.525 --> 17:50.269
I mean, you have this junk ship

17:50.319 --> 17:51.687
and a patched together crew...

17:51.737 --> 17:54.398
- It was easy pickings and the
marines did most of the work.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.284
- You've have the greenest
marine outfit available

17:57.326 --> 17:59.246
- The approach was perfect
right out of the gate.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.966
You couldn't have asked
for a better setup.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.240
- And you've apparently
got the luck of the Irish.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.117
And I'm also the youngest

18:05.167 --> 18:06.994
and least experienced commanding officer

18:07.044 --> 18:08.045
in the entire fleet.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.132
- Always the bright side with you.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.434
- What do you suppose Lydia's up to?

18:24.853 --> 18:26.221
- Counting the corpses on the ship

18:26.271 --> 18:28.107
that we just captured for her daddy?

18:29.983 --> 18:31.711
- That's why you're
thinking of her, isn't it?

18:31.735 --> 18:32.735
That ship.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.214
- Maybe things would be better

18:34.238 --> 18:36.031
if I just went back and married her.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.569
Was it prideful of me to
reject her father's offer?

18:40.619 --> 18:43.238
- No. Your dad may have blown the fortune,

18:43.288 --> 18:45.741
but your family name
still means something.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.035
Abner certainly isn't here for the salary.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.729
- Yeah, we kind of blew
all the family favors

18:49.753 --> 18:50.996
on this trip, didn't we?

18:51.046 --> 18:52.581
- Better to exhaust all your options

18:52.631 --> 18:54.458
than get thrown with the Arkwrights.

18:54.508 --> 18:55.292
You marry Lydia

18:55.342 --> 18:57.237
and you're gonna be dangling
on the end of their strings

18:57.261 --> 18:58.279
for the rest of your life.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.798
- People will die for
our little enterprise.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.424
Two of our marines already did.

19:02.474 --> 19:06.261
They all take the risk: for
citizenship, for a career...

19:06.311 --> 19:09.264
for a little opportunity
to score some loot.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.975
- And don't forget us: here
to save the family farm.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.352
- We're here to prevent you

19:13.402 --> 19:16.480
from becoming some sort of mob husband.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.815
Learn to deal with Lydia later,

19:17.865 --> 19:19.825
and only if you have to.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.370
You about ready to open our orders?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.619
You'd have taken on that
freighter on your own, right?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.621
If Masterson hadn't
brought us to quarters?

19:32.671 --> 19:33.789
- Of course I would have.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.666
I told you, it was the perfect setup.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.500
- You know what?

19:36.550 --> 19:37.334
I didn't even need to ask.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.144
I could see it in your
eyes during the chase,

19:39.803 --> 19:41.088
We're all proud of you.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.631
Your dad's proud of you.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.634
We have to be aggressive out
here sometimes and you were.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.436
It was bold the way you handled it.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.396
Bold.

19:49.813 --> 19:50.639
A little more of that

19:50.689 --> 19:54.226
and you will avoid the cold
clutches of arranged matrimony.

19:54.276 --> 19:58.155
Unless that's... what you want?

20:02.910 --> 20:04.536
I'll leave you to it.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.085
Prize money on the first day!

21:23.657 --> 21:26.151
You know, I'm gonna get
my wife something nice

21:26.201 --> 21:27.527
when we get that bonus money.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.821
- Maybe this DeVol kids does
know a thing or two.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.157
Keeps up like this, we're
all going home loaded.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.408
- How about you, Abel?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.743
You got family back home?

21:34.793 --> 21:35.793
- Not really.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.913
- Sure you do.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.332
Who else would be on that
message you keep playing back

21:40.382 --> 21:42.084
when you don't think anyone's looking?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.877
- None of your business, Dimitri.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.446
- This ship needs a name, don't you think?

21:45.470 --> 21:46.838
- She's got a name.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.924
- Chimera's not much of a name for a lady.

21:48.974 --> 21:49.800
- She's scrap.

21:49.850 --> 21:50.634
- Scrap?

21:50.684 --> 21:52.161
Hell, she's our ticket
through Port Shelley.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.763
You know, the captain's father,
he's the governor there.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.557
He decides which folks did
enough to get citizenship.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.602
They say he's got a
reputation for generosity.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.571
- Yeah, shut up, Salles.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.564
Shelley? She's tougher than she looks.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.701
- Shelley, like "Port Shelley." I
could get behind that.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.304
- Wait, we're just going
to call it Shelley?

22:09.328 --> 22:10.930
- I didn't know what we
were going to get into

22:10.954 --> 22:13.323
when I signed on, but
she's proven herself now.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.742
So what if her bits have mileage,

22:15.792 --> 22:17.703
they're well loved, they work.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.537
- So far.

22:18.587 --> 22:19.371
- I'm serious.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.940
- We're really just
going to call it Shelley?

22:20.964 --> 22:22.541
- I'm serious too.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.152
Didn't you hear the word out of the yards?

22:24.176 --> 22:24.960
What?

22:25.010 --> 22:25.794
Yeah, it's a captured ship

22:25.844 --> 22:28.046
repaired with pieces from
all kinds of other ships.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.424
- Not captured, salvaged.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.385
Two ships, they get different
halves blown off in battle.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.469
All hands lost.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.638
And the admiralty decides
to make the best of it

22:36.688 --> 22:38.682
by welding two ends together.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.393
Why do you think she's the
only hybrid class in the fleet?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.645
Ships like this get sold
at cheap foreign navies

22:43.695 --> 22:47.115
not commissioned as vessels of the State.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.370
- So you're saying that we're
sailing a pair of coffins?

22:52.079 --> 22:52.863
- I guess so.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.197
- I thought I smelled something.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.391
- You're full of crap, Salles.

22:55.415 --> 22:56.533
- Yeah, maybe that's it.

22:56.583 --> 22:59.453
- Hate to burst your dreams of
becoming respectable citizens

22:59.503 --> 23:01.913
but you can check it all out
for yourselves when we put in.

23:01.963 --> 23:04.333
It's incontrovertible.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.544
- incontra... where do you get off?

23:07.594 --> 23:09.004
You think you're so smart?

23:09.054 --> 23:11.173
You're just like the
rest of us, lonely peons.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.007
- That's not what I meant.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.258
- It is a little obnoxious.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.427
Just speak at a level
we can all appreciate.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.553
- Whatever.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.221
I fold.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.431
Philistines.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.849
- That's it, I've had it!

23:20.899 --> 23:21.683
- Whoa.
- Hey, hey!

23:21.733 --> 23:22.517
It's not worth it.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.019
It's all right, man, take it easy.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.737
- Attention on deck!

23:30.742 --> 23:32.702
- What's all this about?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.499
- Nothing, sir.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.328
- Come with me, Salles.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.162
- Sir, I didn't-

23:42.212 --> 23:43.914
- You're being detached from gunnery.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.132
I need a new assistant.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.585
Mr. Saverin's already done the paperwork.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.170
Come on.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.805
Come on.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.101
- Okay, first off,

24:04.151 --> 24:06.103
it's important you understand something

24:06.153 --> 24:07.771
that your predecessor didn't.

24:07.821 --> 24:08.822
- What's that?

24:10.323 --> 24:11.408
- You know nothing.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.528
- Oh.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.823
- I can't waste time breaking
you of your assumptions.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.867
Aggregate displacement
confounds the best of minds.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.452
- Aggregate displacement?

24:22.502 --> 24:24.162
You mean the Static Shift Drive?

24:24.212 --> 24:25.872
Is that what I'll be working on?

24:25.922 --> 24:26.922
- That's right.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.504
- Never thought I'd worked
with an actual warp drive.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.339
Don't use the "W" word.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.924
We'll just laugh at you.

24:35.974 --> 24:39.094
Remember the first
lesson: you know nothing.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.178
- Right.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.514
You know, there's crazy rumors about SSDs.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.724
I always wondered what happens
if something goes wrong

24:44.774 --> 24:45.774
during a transit.

24:48.195 --> 24:51.022
- Best case, we end up off course

24:51.072 --> 24:53.241
due to a missed decimal
point or something.

24:54.242 --> 24:59.206
Worst case, our existences
explode across 16 dimensions.

24:59.873 --> 25:00.999
- Really?

25:01.625 --> 25:02.667
- No.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.130
Go on.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.726
Enough breadboards in there

25:27.776 --> 25:31.688
to make the whole crew
sandwiches. Open face.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.240
- You're a dork...

25:34.449 --> 25:35.449
sir.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.620
- Only a dork would enjoy this.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.948
- I can't pretend I'm not interested.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.667
- Then perhaps I've chosen well.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.626
Here,

25:46.753 --> 25:48.413
get in there and remove the condensation

25:48.463 --> 25:49.923
from between the components.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.501
And be careful.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.386
The boards don't like to be bumped.

25:57.013 --> 26:00.509
Okay, so aggregate displacement,

26:00.559 --> 26:03.094
simply put it's a theory
of quantum science

26:03.144 --> 26:04.846
that allows the ship
to move from one point

26:04.896 --> 26:06.640
in the universe to another.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.351
Given enough power and
the right computations,

26:09.401 --> 26:10.894
it can instantaneously move you

26:10.944 --> 26:13.313
to any point in the universe.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.363
- Any point?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.406
- Any.

26:15.448 --> 26:18.693
- Like, even a point
billions of light years away,

26:18.743 --> 26:19.929
where no one else has ever been?

26:19.953 --> 26:20.737
- Sure.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.656
The more power you can
squeeze through the tube

26:22.706 --> 26:25.200
without frying it, the farther you can go.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.451
Understand though,

26:26.501 --> 26:29.663
it takes a fair bit just to
hop a couple of light years.

26:29.713 --> 26:32.791
The whole process is
extraordinarily sensitive.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.917
- How's that work?

26:33.967 --> 26:36.461
- You know, those fundamental
horrors of the universe

26:36.511 --> 26:38.722
that can drive a man
mad if he learns them?

26:41.099 --> 26:42.592
It's one of those.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.895
- I can't believe I'm working in here.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.464
I've heard people talk about guys like you

26:55.488 --> 26:56.489
like you're royalty.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.574
- We're just guys.

27:02.704 --> 27:03.704
- Sir..

27:06.041 --> 27:07.041
Thanks.

27:07.709 --> 27:08.577
I can't remember the last time

27:08.627 --> 27:11.079
someone really took a chance on me.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.172
You won't regret it.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.632
- No sweat.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.628
Anyway, for right now we're
just doing routine maintenance.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.755
We have to do this before every hop.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.257
- We're leaving the system?

27:22.307 --> 27:24.759
- Captain just told me to do my round.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.186
That usually means travel.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.598
- Gentlemen, we are no longer hunting down

27:29.648 --> 27:32.517
blacklists pirate ships to settle grudges.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.185
We can take prizes of opportunity,

27:34.235 --> 27:36.271
but our goal in mind is one ship.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.565
We are not a part of an
official fleet structure,

27:38.615 --> 27:41.192
but we are expected to
cooperate with other ships

27:41.242 --> 27:44.696
that have the same objective
in mind, allied or otherwise.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.156
- What kind of ship are we chasing?

27:46.206 --> 27:47.206
- We don't know.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.128
One of our allies was
able to take this picture.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.924
- Intelligence calls her the White Ship.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.803
She appears and attacks
ships seemingly at random.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.048
She bears no identifying markings

28:03.098 --> 28:05.433
other than her distinctive
coat of white paint.

28:06.393 --> 28:09.638
- Captain, may I ask who
gave us this information?

28:09.688 --> 28:12.182
- I'm not at liberty to be
specific about the source.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.683
- Of course not.
- Watch your tone.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.736
- It's all right, Gary, speak your mind.

28:18.154 --> 28:21.107
- Captain, our allies can't
even take a decent picture

28:21.157 --> 28:22.367
of what killed them.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.945
And if this massive ship even exists,

28:25.995 --> 28:28.448
our allies are probably hoping that either

28:28.498 --> 28:30.659
we're more competent than they are,

28:30.709 --> 28:33.119
or that we're better at
absorbing cannon fire.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.329
- Have some decency, Gary.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.547
- Oh, to hell with decency!

28:37.090 --> 28:38.625
The only reason we'd all cooperate

28:38.675 --> 28:40.695
is that we each expect each
other to lie down and die

28:40.719 --> 28:41.753
for our own success.

28:41.803 --> 28:42.545
- Gary!

28:42.595 --> 28:45.632
- I guarantee you they're
thinking exactly the same thing.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.727
- The chairman himself
has issued these orders.

28:50.562 --> 28:54.349
Every able vessel is being
called out to join in this hunt.

28:54.399 --> 28:58.144
Several of our courier ships
have already been destroyed.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.563
This is big.

29:00.613 --> 29:04.317
It strikes at the very heart
of our national industry.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.278
Without those ships we could
not provide the services

29:07.328 --> 29:09.406
that more or less fund our country.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.308
There's far more at stake
here than the interest

29:11.332 --> 29:13.585
of whatever nation first
called us into this.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.706
- All the more reason to keep
what Gary is saying in mind.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.756
Look,

29:19.966 --> 29:23.253
some of our "friends" may not necessarily

29:23.303 --> 29:24.929
have our best interests in mind.

29:25.805 --> 29:28.466
Still, we have as good a shot as anyone

29:28.516 --> 29:31.761
at finding this White Ship,

29:31.811 --> 29:33.188
if we play our cards right.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.189
- Thank you, Abner.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.526
And there's something else.

29:39.986 --> 29:43.606
Chairman Houser has
offered up a remarkable sum

29:43.656 --> 29:45.116
for the capture of this ship.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.871
He's marked half his
receipts from last quarter,

29:50.789 --> 29:54.584
and he's leaning on admiralty to match it.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.299
- Is that from his gross or net?

30:02.467 --> 30:03.467
- Gross.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.755
Last quarter was quite kind to him

30:06.805 --> 30:08.306
from the numbers I've seen.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.092
Now, all we have to do is make sure

30:11.142 --> 30:13.728
that we're part of the
group that finishes her off.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.431
- Well, I think we're
all with you, captain.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.483
So where do we start?

30:21.110 --> 30:23.738
- We'll move out system and
hover at Cretcham Point.

30:24.572 --> 30:28.568
From there we'll make transition to...

30:33.832 --> 30:37.577
Here, the Prentiss system,

30:37.627 --> 30:39.504
right at the edge of the Deccan Abyss.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.666
Pretty far out.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.069
It's about the most we can do in one hop.

30:45.093 --> 30:48.046
Take a couple of days charging
before we could come back.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.507
- And awfully close to Yankee territory.

30:50.557 --> 30:53.101
- Everything out here is
close to Yankee territory.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.524
Why this area, captain?

31:00.900 --> 31:02.602
It's awful sparse traffic out there

31:02.652 --> 31:03.945
and a long way from home.

31:05.280 --> 31:09.150
It's unlikely we'll run into
anything, even other hunters.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.594
- A lot of the attacks have taken place

31:10.618 --> 31:12.529
at the edge of the Deccan.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.905
I'm playing a hunch

31:13.955 --> 31:16.616
that they're making their
way around the brim.

31:16.666 --> 31:18.660
We can resupply at Hiram,

31:18.710 --> 31:20.578
and then funnel it through
St. Nishith's Fell,

31:20.628 --> 31:22.580
the orbital station there.

31:22.630 --> 31:23.998
- An ally?

31:24.048 --> 31:26.292
More like the only show in town.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.094
They'll be somebody to buy from there.

31:29.762 --> 31:30.839
Okay then,

31:30.889 --> 31:33.716
I expect all of you to carry
out your duties as usual,

31:33.766 --> 31:36.427
and to keep unnecessary
information from the crew.

31:36.477 --> 31:39.022
SepMOD operators will
have elevated privileges.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.565
Any questions?

31:44.611 --> 31:47.313
You may return to your duties.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.622
Bold!

32:18.311 --> 32:20.438
Something on your mind, Abner?

32:20.730 --> 32:23.141
- I'm just curious about this hunch.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.085
You really think they're
just making a clockwise tour

32:25.109 --> 32:26.903
of the Deccan's edge?

32:27.028 --> 32:29.322
- I said it was a hunch.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.995
- You already knew what our orders were.

32:36.704 --> 32:41.034
Not the usual generalities,
someone gave you specifics.

32:41.084 --> 32:46.089
- Prentiss is an educated guess.

32:47.298 --> 32:50.126
There's been some unusual
activity reported there

32:50.176 --> 32:51.920
the last few days.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.889
- And you think it's
really this White Ship?

32:56.683 --> 32:57.892
Well,

33:00.019 --> 33:02.689
it's a long way to go on a hunch.

33:03.272 --> 33:06.651
I admire your gumption, Captain.

33:35.596 --> 33:37.256
- Helm, Full stop and hover.

33:37.306 --> 33:39.300
- Aye sir, full stop and hover.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.058
All stop captain, trimming to hover.

33:52.572 --> 33:55.066
Trimming complete ship is hovering.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.785
- Mr. Hess we are ready
to commence the sequence.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.863
- Commencing sequence.

34:00.913 --> 34:02.782
60 seconds on my mark.

34:02.832 --> 34:07.662
Three, two, one mark.

34:07.712 --> 34:08.496
Comms.

34:08.546 --> 34:09.998
- Heads are rigged in and stowed.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.958
- LSO.
-  Stable.

34:12.008 --> 34:12.875
- Fire control.

34:12.925 --> 34:15.294
- Powered down, all
guns in locked position.

34:15.344 --> 34:16.671
- Maneuvering

34:16.721 --> 34:20.049
- SSD at standby. Reactors
at a hundred percent.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.468
All redundant systems are suspended.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.512
Mr Tamai, power the SSD.

34:24.562 --> 34:27.015
- Power SSD, aye sir.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.392
Operator, open her up steady.

34:29.442 --> 34:32.361
.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.024
- Steady increase.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.651
Normal continuum extraction,
fold attenuating.

34:38.701 --> 34:39.736
- Coolant?

34:39.786 --> 34:41.704
- Natural circulation, nominal flow.

34:42.622 --> 34:44.657
- Why does everyone look so nervous?

34:44.707 --> 34:48.036
- Our SSD was only given short
tests before re-christening.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.842
- Are you nervous?

34:56.511 --> 34:58.179
- Yup.

35:00.056 --> 35:00.965
- 34...

35:01.015 --> 35:01.841
33...

35:01.891 --> 35:02.675
32...

35:02.725 --> 35:03.725
31...

35:03.768 --> 35:04.594
30...

35:04.644 --> 35:05.470
29...

35:05.520 --> 35:06.429
28...

35:06.479 --> 35:07.597
27...

35:07.647 --> 35:08.598
26...

35:08.648 --> 35:09.807
25...

35:09.857 --> 35:10.892
24...

35:10.942 --> 35:12.018
23...

35:12.068 --> 35:13.144
22...

35:13.194 --> 35:14.270
21...

35:14.320 --> 35:15.188
20...

35:15.238 --> 35:16.147
19...

35:16.197 --> 35:17.197
18...

35:20.576 --> 35:21.360

35:21.410 --> 35:22.445

35:22.495 --> 35:23.279

11...

35:24.288 --> 35:25.073
10...

35:25.123 --> 35:26.574
- Vents to full open.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.335
5...

35:30.378 --> 35:31.378
4...

35:31.420 --> 35:32.205
3...

35:32.255 --> 35:33.255
2...

35:33.297 --> 35:34.082
1...

35:34.132 --> 35:35.291
Execute!

35:43.182 --> 35:44.675
- SSD is powering down.

35:44.725 --> 35:45.810
All systems nominal.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.763
- Reactors to 75 percent.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.107
- Aye, sir, reactors to 75 percent.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.236
- What went wrong?

35:56.821 --> 35:57.647
- Nothing went wrong.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.232
We're here.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.191
- Then that's it?

36:00.241 --> 36:01.241
- That's it.

36:03.411 --> 36:04.996
- Ugh...!

36:07.456 --> 36:08.699
- That's bizarre.

36:08.749 --> 36:09.867
- You taste copper?

36:09.917 --> 36:12.453
- Yeah, thought I was bleeding.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.413
- Happens to about 10% of people.

36:14.463 --> 36:15.923
It won't hurt you.

36:17.842 --> 36:18.709
Is it time for lunch yet?

36:18.759 --> 36:21.053
I'm starving like an artist.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.049
- You're a dork, sir.

36:25.099 --> 36:27.718
- 190 million miles out of Hiram.

36:27.768 --> 36:31.305
Solid hover, origin point marked.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.900
- All compartments secure
from transition sequence.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.403
No errors.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.650
No errors.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.361
They did her alright after all.

36:45.411 --> 36:48.614
Tom. Go and take the Conn,

36:48.664 --> 36:50.533
plot us a course for mid system.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.368
Let's get hunting.

36:52.418 --> 36:53.828
- Aye aye, Captain.

36:53.878 --> 36:58.040
Helm, come to course 150 by 041.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.042
Roll angle 12 degrees.

37:00.092 --> 37:03.004
Burn ahead one half and hold, 6 hours.

37:03.054 --> 37:06.507
- Aye sir, course 150 by 041.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.259
Roll angle to 12 degrees.

37:08.309 --> 37:09.844
Burn one half for 6 hours.

37:11.270 --> 37:14.891
- Never been this far from home.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.893
- Homesick?

37:16.943 --> 37:18.361
- No.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.646
You did EW
in your last assignment?

38:01.696 --> 38:03.856
Just as an assistant but, yeah.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.775
- And their set up was crap.

38:05.825 --> 38:08.402
The captain only got five
keys from the Admiralty

38:08.452 --> 38:11.864
so they had me trying to hack
one ship after the other.

38:11.914 --> 38:14.408
In the end, we would always
just blow down the doors.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.411
That's one thing I will give
to our intrepid captain.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.830
He didn't skimp on that keyring.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.840
- Yeah, how is he supposed
to have all this stuff?

38:21.882 --> 38:25.086
I mean, isn't he supposed
to be low on cash?

38:25.136 --> 38:26.405
- You shouldn't be talking about that.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.255
- Oh, come on, Kai.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.464
You've heard the rumors.

38:28.514 --> 38:31.008
I mean, he went to one of the top schools,

38:31.058 --> 38:32.802
was in one of those clubs.

38:32.852 --> 38:33.678
- Now that's enough.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.846
- It's obvious he's in
bed with high government.

38:35.896 --> 38:38.391
His surname should have
tipped you off on that.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.685
There's no question that IO is involved.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.045
- Why would the Intelligence Office

38:42.069 --> 38:43.813
have anything to do with it?

38:43.863 --> 38:44.605
Beats me,

38:44.655 --> 38:45.898
but who else has the resources

38:45.948 --> 38:47.692
to supply something like this?

38:47.742 --> 38:49.902
I mean did you see those
unmarked ordinance crates

38:49.952 --> 38:51.362
that we took on a few days ago?

38:51.412 --> 38:53.348
I bet you those are some
of those new molten rounds.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.198
- Who told you all of this?

38:54.248 --> 38:56.492
- How about that big red
button up at the fire control?

38:56.542 --> 38:57.622
- Yeah, what is that thing?

38:57.668 --> 38:58.828
- Testudo.

38:58.878 --> 38:59.878
- Tortoise?

38:59.920 --> 39:01.247
- Tortoise shell.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.124
The outer shake-coat layer of our armor

39:03.174 --> 39:05.376
is nothing unusual for a warship

39:05.426 --> 39:07.003
but they discovered a while ago

39:07.053 --> 39:09.588
that if you run out the
heavy current through it

39:09.638 --> 39:11.465
in these alternating grid patterns

39:11.515 --> 39:14.977
it hardens to something like
20 times its usual strength.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.849
- That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.168
You run current through any metal

39:21.192 --> 39:22.310
and all it does is heat up.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.769
It actually weakens it.

39:23.819 --> 39:25.646
Not to mention the scientific fact

39:25.696 --> 39:27.049
that all semiconducting
conducting materials

39:27.073 --> 39:28.232
like our outer armor

39:28.282 --> 39:29.984
actively resist current.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.737
- Not this semiconducting material.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.547
- If you don't know how
it works just say so.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.741
Don't try and make it up.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.743
- Why isn't this standard
across the fleet?

39:38.793 --> 39:40.745
- Because while it sounds great in theory,

39:40.795 --> 39:43.497
in practice the TS burns
through so much power,

39:43.547 --> 39:45.916
our reactors could never hold it constant.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.918
Moreover the alternating grid phases

39:47.968 --> 39:50.254
have this unexplained habit
of trying to flow back

39:50.304 --> 39:51.714
into the transformers.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.050
The systems burn themselves
out within a few seconds

39:54.100 --> 39:57.686
and take everything that
was connected to them.

39:59.647 --> 40:00.431
- That's crazy.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.432
Why would anyone want that?

40:01.482 --> 40:02.767
- Search me.

40:02.817 --> 40:07.063
Who knows what evil lurks in
the mind of inbred aristocrats.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.148
- Now that is enough.

40:09.198 --> 40:11.734
You stop with all this gossip right now.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.403
Quite frankly, it's
unbecoming of officers.

40:14.453 --> 40:16.322
Besides don't you have
something better to do?

40:16.372 --> 40:19.033
- I do now, if that's
gonna be your attitude.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.452
- Wipe the cereal off your
face and get outta of here.

40:21.502 --> 40:22.995
No more of that talk.

40:23.045 --> 40:24.914
I mean it.

40:25.673 --> 40:26.942
And that's
a risky gamble there

40:26.966 --> 40:28.542
but if he can hide the cannon

40:28.592 --> 40:30.378
before the ref gets up
he'll be in the lead!

40:30.428 --> 40:32.280
Red, what do you think of
this move by Pinkerton?

40:32.304 --> 40:34.507
Oh, it's a
failure of diplomacy Ted.

40:34.557 --> 40:37.259
This may be a case of winning
the battle and losing the war.

40:37.309 --> 40:38.928
- This show sucks!

40:38.978 --> 40:39.978
- What are you five?

40:40.020 --> 40:40.805
Shut up.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.306
The grownups are trying to watch.

40:42.356 --> 40:43.599
- At least it's new.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.142
Who's broadcasting this?

40:45.192 --> 40:46.060
- Saint Nishith.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.646
I think they imported it from Puerto Mal

40:48.696 --> 40:50.022
and quit playing with your hair.

40:50.072 --> 40:50.981
Or we'll hold you down again,

40:51.031 --> 40:52.400
shave the rest off.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.776
- What is this?

40:53.826 --> 40:54.985
- Garbage.

40:55.035 --> 40:57.154
How do you have any brain cells left, Eli?

40:57.204 --> 41:00.866
- I keep spares in tiny vials
rolled up with my socks.

41:07.214 --> 41:09.375
- Where did they dig up
these marines, anyway?

41:09.425 --> 41:11.001
- Backside of somewhere.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.711
- How would they not talk to us?

41:12.761 --> 41:13.822
- Why, would you want them to?

41:13.846 --> 41:16.215
- I mean we do share a ship with them.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.425
- So?

41:17.475 --> 41:20.102
They're weirdos, just leave them be.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.054
It's enough to try to do your job

41:22.104 --> 41:23.389
and keep your sanity out here

41:23.439 --> 41:26.684
without some lunatics trying
to raise the dead next door.

41:26.734 --> 41:27.794
- They aren't summoning the dead,

41:27.818 --> 41:29.270
they're sending prayers to the Shah.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.479
- Oh are they?

41:30.529 --> 41:31.313
And what is a Shah?

41:31.363 --> 41:33.065
- A male peacock.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.067
- He's their king, basically.

41:35.117 --> 41:37.653
Way back when, their Irish
leader started co-opting bits

41:37.703 --> 41:39.864
of Persian and Viking culture.

41:39.914 --> 41:40.739
Then, he convinced them

41:40.789 --> 41:42.700
that all of their prayers flow through him

41:42.750 --> 41:44.952
to their respective gods.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.313
It's a good thing they can shoot straight

41:46.337 --> 41:47.830
since they think in pretzels.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.082
- That sounds like devil worship to me.

41:50.132 --> 41:52.877
Praying to some crazy possessed man.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.670
- Superstitious now?

41:54.720 --> 41:57.214
Gosh sailor, way to beat the stereotype.

41:57.264 --> 42:00.426
- You know, I've seen that medal you have.

42:00.476 --> 42:01.260
You only pull it out

42:01.310 --> 42:02.454
when you think no one's looking

42:02.478 --> 42:05.097
but I've seen you staring at that thing.

42:05.147 --> 42:06.599
Almost if you were praying to it.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.934
- It's not religious you moron.

42:08.984 --> 42:10.519
It's just something my mother gave me.

42:10.569 --> 42:12.396
- Oh, good for you.

42:12.446 --> 42:14.523
Go back to your book mama's boy.

42:14.573 --> 42:16.134
Red, what are
you looking forward to?

42:16.158 --> 42:17.651
My son's next birthday.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.111
I bought him a home chemestry set.

42:19.161 --> 42:21.914
panel analyze that, shortly...

42:21.956 --> 42:23.016
- They can't really be trying

42:23.040 --> 42:25.534
to summon demons or something, can they?

42:25.584 --> 42:27.119
Who knows?

42:27.169 --> 42:29.955
Why don't you go ask him
and see what happens?

42:30.005 --> 42:32.249
- I ain't talking to no demon raisers!

42:32.299 --> 42:34.486
...generous grant from
the Elgin Foundation For Preserving

42:34.510 --> 42:36.295
arts and perishable food products.

42:36.345 --> 42:39.640
And in part by donations
from viewers like you.

42:39.848 --> 42:42.551
This show sucks.

42:52.778 --> 42:54.522
Got something?

42:54.572 --> 42:55.689
- Yeah, I think so.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.858
It's unofficial chatter, audio only

42:57.908 --> 42:59.485
but it caught our attention.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.491
- It's gone sir.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.010
- What do you think?

43:16.885 --> 43:19.338
- I think we should tell the captain.

43:19.388 --> 43:20.931
- Good man.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.177
- She's here, gentlemen.

43:25.227 --> 43:28.138
Nursing wounds out beyond
the edge of the system.

43:28.188 --> 43:29.974
- We intercepted comm traffic

43:30.024 --> 43:33.310
that indicates a very
large ship of unknown class

43:33.360 --> 43:35.854
attacked a convoy on its way out system.

43:35.904 --> 43:36.939
Bad luck for them

43:36.989 --> 43:39.984
the convoy came with a
major escort compliment.

43:40.034 --> 43:41.777
Those warships carved her up pretty badly

43:41.827 --> 43:44.913
but they chose not to pursue.

43:46.665 --> 43:50.336
- She finally walked into a
fight she wasn't prepared for.

43:53.130 --> 43:53.914
- We'll resupply

43:53.964 --> 43:56.625
then head out into the empty
on her suspected tangent

43:56.675 --> 43:59.795
We'll sweep outward,
zigzagging on all axes.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.422
Active sweeps at high speed

44:01.472 --> 44:03.632
and we take this one aggressively,

44:03.682 --> 44:05.801
just like the gun-runner.

44:05.851 --> 44:08.053
- It's a good plan.

44:08.103 --> 44:10.439
Looks like your hunch is paying off.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.610
- Dismissed.

44:43.597 --> 44:47.468
After so many
years of disappointments,

44:47.518 --> 44:50.596
I must say that the notion
of feeling genuine pride

44:50.646 --> 44:54.066
for another member of the
family is, well...

44:54.108 --> 44:55.651
alluring.

44:56.318 --> 44:58.896
I won't pretend that I'm
exactly holding my breath,

44:58.946 --> 45:03.909
understand, but it feels good
to be mildly hopeful for once.

45:04.743 --> 45:08.247
You are making a major first step.

45:09.456 --> 45:12.534
Something that your parents,
neither one of them,

45:12.584 --> 45:14.670
could ever bothered to consider...

45:15.754 --> 45:17.873
- You're due in deck in five minutes.

45:17.923 --> 45:19.333
- I know.

45:19.383 --> 45:20.383
- Mother?

45:21.719 --> 45:23.253
- How old do I look to you?

45:23.303 --> 45:24.171
- Aunt?

45:24.221 --> 45:25.221
Grandparent?

45:27.433 --> 45:28.433
Girlfriend?

45:31.061 --> 45:34.314
It's okay, no one's gonna judge!

45:38.318 --> 45:40.354
The closest
we've been able to figure,

45:40.404 --> 45:43.357
this ship is unfeasibly accurate at range

45:43.407 --> 45:47.486
or else has some way of
closing distance fast.

45:47.536 --> 45:50.539
We have a hard time separating
the myth from the fact.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.283
Whatever it is the White Ship is doing,

45:53.333 --> 45:56.120
we're pretty sure it happens fast.

45:56.170 --> 45:59.840
Some of the boxes we found
haven't even logged cries for help.

46:01.300 --> 46:04.128
I don't envy you, and
I don't think your dad

46:04.178 --> 46:06.880
should have encouraged this excursion in...

46:06.930 --> 46:07.930
- Come in.

46:12.269 --> 46:13.353
- Any word from home?

46:16.356 --> 46:18.168
The Port Authority is
demanding a "pass through" fee

46:18.192 --> 46:20.728
for the water, 1200 in Rhodesian Pounds.

46:20.778 --> 46:21.687
- I'll bet.

46:21.737 --> 46:23.397
Go ahead and give it to them.

46:23.447 --> 46:25.816
That will
take us closer to reserve.

46:25.866 --> 46:29.403
- With the prize money coming
in, we should be all right.

46:29.453 --> 46:32.790
By the way, Abner, I've been
going over the crew bios again.

46:33.665 --> 46:35.385
- Did you have a question
about one of them?

46:35.417 --> 46:38.036
- You call Saverin an "evocatus."

46:38.086 --> 46:40.005
Now my Latin is a bit rusty,

46:41.799 --> 46:44.168
but which of the two
empires does he hail from?

46:44.218 --> 46:46.378
- I found him a while
back doing mercenary work,

46:46.428 --> 46:49.389
and he mentioned he did two
tours on a Martellan vessel.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.510
Are you worried about his
credentials or his loyalty?

46:53.560 --> 46:56.305
- I'd like to know how and why he left.

46:56.355 --> 46:57.848
- Ask him.

46:57.898 --> 46:59.099
I didn't.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.768
He's served with me on two ships now,

47:00.818 --> 47:03.237
and always with competence and devotion.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.341
If you had any doubts, you
should have said something

47:06.365 --> 47:07.399
before we left port.

47:07.449 --> 47:09.493
- I don't have doubts, it's just...

47:11.370 --> 47:13.747
Look at who we're docked with.

47:22.381 --> 47:24.025
I'm just a bit worried
that if they see him,

47:24.049 --> 47:25.717
they might try and take him back.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.963
I had hoped that their war wouldn't reach

47:30.013 --> 47:31.673
this close to us though.

47:31.723 --> 47:34.635
- Well, for what it's worth,
I can say with confidence

47:34.685 --> 47:36.804
that Saverin seems to have
lost faith in his homeland

47:36.854 --> 47:41.316
during his second tour, but
he didn't desert or go rogue.

47:42.150 --> 47:43.519
He's not a fugitive.

47:43.569 --> 47:45.529
He is just a bit bitter, I think.

47:47.030 --> 47:50.692
We'll have no trouble from the
Empires, either one of them.

47:50.742 --> 47:52.119
- Thank God for that.

48:11.680 --> 48:14.091
- 17 hour burn starting now.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.801
Cease burn at 2600 hours.

48:15.851 --> 48:19.229
Helm, roll us left to
three-one-five, maintain vertical.

48:20.480 --> 48:24.309
- Rolling left three-one-five,
maintaining vertical.

48:24.359 --> 48:27.437
- SepMOD, Conn, report all contacts.

48:27.487 --> 48:28.756
Sparse traffic to stern,

48:28.780 --> 48:30.232
all bearings shifting to port.

48:30.282 --> 48:32.651
Two commercial vessels, seven private.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.161
All other tangents empty.

48:47.132 --> 48:48.458
- It's not just about the cash,

48:48.508 --> 48:50.127
it's the whole issue with aristocracy,

48:50.177 --> 48:52.462
the DeVol family may have
helped found the nation,

48:52.512 --> 48:55.090
but that hasn't kept them
from falling out of favor.

48:55.140 --> 48:57.384
They have permanent
governorship over Port Shelley,

48:57.434 --> 49:00.762
but granddad still managed
to screw that one up too.

49:00.812 --> 49:03.974
This whole ship is just
daddy's last ditch effort

49:04.024 --> 49:05.767
to regain relevance.

49:05.817 --> 49:07.152
- What happens if he fails?

49:08.612 --> 49:11.356
- Dissolution of the family
property, basically handing over

49:11.406 --> 49:13.609
the family name to someone
else in lieu of payment

49:13.659 --> 49:16.486
and I've even heard talk
of an arranged marriage

49:16.536 --> 49:19.114
to one of the Arkwright
daughters, could you imagine?

49:19.164 --> 49:20.490
- What's this?

49:20.540 --> 49:22.326
- Just a friendly conversation.

49:22.376 --> 49:23.452
- Right.

49:23.502 --> 49:24.812
Because who doesn't enjoy gibbering

49:24.836 --> 49:26.455
with their girlfriend between classes?

49:26.505 --> 49:28.540
- All right, all right.

49:28.590 --> 49:31.877
But you have to admit
that he is a little off.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.545
I mean he acts like a scared ensign.

49:33.595 --> 49:36.757
- Mr. Royce, I have tolerated
your attitude to this point,

49:36.807 --> 49:38.717
but you are testing the
limits of my patience.

49:38.767 --> 49:39.968
- Oh, come on.

49:40.018 --> 49:42.971
He's got us chasing phantom
ships out here in the empty.

49:43.021 --> 49:44.348
He's holed up in his cabin.

49:44.398 --> 49:46.516
I mean he's probably going
pants-crapping insane

49:46.566 --> 49:48.235
just from the pressure of it all.

49:49.778 --> 49:51.196
- You wanna repeat that?

49:53.991 --> 49:56.652
No really, I wanna hear
the in-depth assessment

49:56.702 --> 49:58.745
from the only actual ensign on board.

49:59.621 --> 50:00.822
And how far along are you

50:00.872 --> 50:02.833
with your qualification courses, again?

50:03.667 --> 50:06.253
Clear off, before I skin you.

50:14.386 --> 50:16.546
- I loathe children.

50:16.596 --> 50:19.883
- Look, I know you keep him
on the straight and narrow

50:19.933 --> 50:23.428
as far as performing his job,
but you have to make sure

50:23.478 --> 50:26.056
he shows more respect for his Captain,

50:26.106 --> 50:28.900
no matter what your personal
issues may be with the man.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.270
- Very well.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.314
Where did you find him anyway?

50:34.364 --> 50:36.400
- Loafing around the house.

50:36.450 --> 50:39.494
But at least my brother
says we're even now.

50:44.666 --> 50:46.501
Hey Abel, are you awake?

50:48.420 --> 50:49.420
- Yeah.

50:50.505 --> 50:51.882
- Why did you come out here?

50:54.259 --> 50:55.719
- His girlfriend told him to.

50:56.678 --> 50:59.181
Okay, I'm sure she's worth it.

51:00.474 --> 51:01.925
- Why do you care?

51:01.975 --> 51:03.351
- I can't resist a mystery.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.681
- She's my Great Aunt.

51:07.731 --> 51:10.225
I knew it!

51:10.275 --> 51:12.894
Did she knit you a sweater for the trip?

51:12.944 --> 51:15.605
Offer to come along and rock you to sleep?

51:15.655 --> 51:17.491
- You'd have to salute her if she did.

51:19.451 --> 51:21.453
- Wait... AstroNavy?

51:23.455 --> 51:24.455
An officer?

51:25.499 --> 51:29.911
- She commanded six ladyships
before she retired. Mustang.

51:29.961 --> 51:31.880
Worked her way up from the very bottom.

51:33.048 --> 51:35.300
- Wow, I'm impressed.

51:37.677 --> 51:41.139
- You know, she has
these aspirations for me

51:42.265 --> 51:45.635
and she wants me off those
ghetto islands back home.

51:45.685 --> 51:47.854
Proper citizenship
wouldn't be bad, either.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.442
- I was thinking the same
thing when Gladys was born.

51:53.735 --> 51:56.780
I want to make enough to
get her a good education.

51:58.782 --> 52:00.760
You know she's gonna make it
through Port Shelley some day.

52:00.784 --> 52:01.985
- Them goals is lofty.

52:02.035 --> 52:04.946
- Have some kids of your own,
you'll make even higher ones.

52:04.996 --> 52:06.323
- I'm okay with what I have.

52:06.373 --> 52:08.825
- Yeah, a tough life,
banging on one cylinder.

52:08.875 --> 52:10.127
- Shut up, Dimitri.

52:11.211 --> 52:15.582
- So... you don't have
any kids, then, Abel?

52:15.632 --> 52:17.425
No.

52:27.644 --> 52:30.097
What do you think we're
doing out here anyway?

52:30.147 --> 52:31.189
Out in the black?

52:32.440 --> 52:33.440
- Why?

52:34.442 --> 52:35.268
You worried or something?

52:35.318 --> 52:36.318
- No.

52:37.612 --> 52:41.241
Well, yeah, maybe a little.

52:43.326 --> 52:45.403
- There's nothing to worry about.

52:45.453 --> 52:47.280
Just empty space.

52:47.330 --> 52:49.457
- But that's just it, I mean...

52:50.375 --> 52:53.545
anything could be out here.

52:57.841 --> 52:59.551
- There's nothing out here.

53:06.308 --> 53:07.092
- The men are starting to wonder

53:07.142 --> 53:09.177
what we're doing out here.

53:09.227 --> 53:10.705
- I'm beginning to wonder that myself.

53:10.729 --> 53:13.765
- Well, a little reflection
is good for a captain.

53:13.815 --> 53:17.352
But I hesitate
to turn back as well.

53:17.402 --> 53:18.671
The admiralty will be expecting to hear

53:18.695 --> 53:19.839
back from us in a couple of days.

53:19.863 --> 53:22.524
- Don't make that the
decision point though.

53:22.574 --> 53:23.817
With ships this far out,

53:23.867 --> 53:25.777
those deadlines are pretty flexible.

53:25.827 --> 53:27.612
- Well, we have been
out here for some time,

53:27.662 --> 53:28.613
and at some point,

53:28.663 --> 53:30.490
we're gonna have to turn back.

53:30.540 --> 53:32.500
It's up to you when.

53:34.753 --> 53:36.872
- But to turn back empty handed?

53:36.922 --> 53:38.874
That doesn't
mean that we're giving up.

53:38.924 --> 53:41.084
We could still replenish
and resume the hunt.

53:41.134 --> 53:43.628
- Not if somebody finds her first,

53:43.678 --> 53:46.840
we might return home,
and find out that there's

53:46.890 --> 53:48.675
nothing left, that it's all done,

53:48.725 --> 53:49.968
there's nothing left to resume.

53:50.018 --> 53:51.720
- Don't be like that, Marcus.

53:51.770 --> 53:54.139
- That's the dirty little secret here.

53:54.189 --> 53:55.416
It was never gonna be enough to

53:55.440 --> 53:57.058
hunt down pirates and collect bounties,

53:57.108 --> 54:00.520
without the White Ship,
Dad and I are finished.

54:00.570 --> 54:03.481
The long line of DeVols, ever since Uriah,

54:03.531 --> 54:05.634
will just be snuffed out.
It's a fine irony.

54:05.825 --> 54:08.862
He founded a country where
the most successful man rules,

54:08.912 --> 54:10.697
gives the Chairmanship to his son,

54:10.747 --> 54:13.667
and the idiot loses it immediately.

54:15.335 --> 54:17.746
And the rest of us have just been
spiraling downward since.

54:17.796 --> 54:20.999
- Technically, Uriah founded
a communications company.

54:21.049 --> 54:22.485
It just happened to grow rich enough,

54:22.509 --> 54:24.127
that it was able to be nationalized.

54:24.177 --> 54:25.545
- Thank you, Abner.

54:25.595 --> 54:27.255
I'm well aware of my family history,

54:27.305 --> 54:30.550
I heard it every day
while I was in school.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.719
"Your family screws up so bad,

54:32.769 --> 54:34.409
that we're going to give them the one job

54:34.437 --> 54:37.724
that nobody can actually lose:"

54:37.774 --> 54:39.476
Port Shelley.

54:39.526 --> 54:42.437
What happened to
you in school is irrelevant.

54:42.487 --> 54:44.197
You're here now, you're the commander.

54:45.365 --> 54:47.192
Teenage bullies have no bearing on your

54:47.242 --> 54:48.443
responsibility to your crew

54:48.493 --> 54:51.621
or your family back home.
- Do not lecture me, Abner.

54:51.788 --> 54:54.699
My experience has everything
to do with who I am...

54:54.749 --> 54:58.036
- Oh no, no, no, we're not gonna
do this self pitying, woe is me...

54:58.086 --> 54:59.788
- I am not... I'm not self-pitying!

54:59.838 --> 55:01.798
- Oh yes, you are!

55:01.840 --> 55:04.417
Did you think this was gonna be easy?

55:04.467 --> 55:08.255
This is the real world of
combat, war, and death.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.090
Thank whatever it is that you pray to

55:10.140 --> 55:12.259
that you haven't directly
seen the death yet.

55:12.309 --> 55:12.976
- Abner!

55:13.018 --> 55:14.844
- You're leading a crew of men!

55:14.894 --> 55:17.722
And they need a man to lead them.

55:17.772 --> 55:19.432
Are you just gonna mope around because

55:19.482 --> 55:21.726
your first stab at a tough mission,

55:21.776 --> 55:23.528
is coming up empty?

55:24.821 --> 55:26.406
Grow up, Marcus.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.491
Right now.

55:43.214 --> 55:46.251
- 1700 hours, cruising as before.

55:46.301 --> 55:48.044
1700 hours,

55:48.094 --> 55:50.797
cruising as before, so noted.

55:50.847 --> 55:53.600
- SepMOD, Conn, report all contacts.

55:56.603 --> 55:57.929
No contacts, sir.

55:57.979 --> 55:59.481
All scopes clear.

56:00.648 --> 56:02.142
- What's our heading?

56:02.192 --> 56:05.111
100 by 385.

56:06.654 --> 56:08.356
- Burn to full stop,

56:08.406 --> 56:11.368
steer to 010 and resume speed.

56:12.327 --> 56:14.738
- Full stop, steer 010,

56:14.788 --> 56:16.281
and resume speed, aye, sir.

56:18.833 --> 56:20.285
- Gary, take the Conn.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.892
We are really out there now,

57:25.942 --> 57:28.945
back to the onboard library... whoa, wait.

57:31.614 --> 57:32.907
Just a glitch.

57:33.908 --> 57:35.819
Ghost in the machine.

57:35.869 --> 57:38.738
- Do we really have to
bring ghosts into this?

57:38.788 --> 57:40.266
We don't have to, I just meant that...

57:40.290 --> 57:42.158
Then don't, okay.

57:42.208 --> 57:43.960
Just, just...

57:46.045 --> 57:47.045
Just don't.

58:47.440 --> 58:49.192
- I don't believe it...

58:50.610 --> 58:52.145
Captain to SepMOD!

58:52.195 --> 58:53.446
Captain to SepMOD!

58:58.993 --> 59:00.578
I don't believe it.

59:02.288 --> 59:03.408
What is she doing?

59:03.456 --> 59:05.116
She's not doing anything.

59:05.166 --> 59:06.826
Emissions? Broadcasts?

59:06.876 --> 59:09.829
None, either she's
got fantastic shielding,

59:09.879 --> 59:12.123
or her reactor's cold.

59:12.173 --> 59:13.666
- Dead in the water?

59:13.716 --> 59:15.543
- No, she'd be drifting if there

59:15.593 --> 59:17.003
was a sudden power loss.

59:17.053 --> 59:18.421
- Maybe she hopped?

59:18.471 --> 59:19.714
And we just happened on her

59:19.764 --> 59:20.783
before she could get up and running?

59:20.807 --> 59:23.343
- There should still be something.

59:23.393 --> 59:24.453
- It has to be the White Ship.

59:24.477 --> 59:26.554
I mean, look at the size of her!

59:26.604 --> 59:27.722
In this part of the void,

59:27.772 --> 59:29.166
there can't be more than a couple of ships

59:29.190 --> 59:31.476
that big and running around.

59:31.526 --> 59:33.394
- Foley, what is she?

59:33.444 --> 59:36.147
- I don't know, captain.

59:36.197 --> 59:37.357
The computer is calling it a

59:37.407 --> 59:38.858
civilian Ontos Cruiser,

59:38.908 --> 59:41.319
but the silhouette's all wrong.

59:41.369 --> 59:43.162
Whatever this is,

59:44.122 --> 59:45.949
I don't think it's in our databases.

59:45.999 --> 59:48.001
- It's her, it's gotta be!

59:49.252 --> 59:50.837
Captain?

1:00:01.931 --> 1:00:04.092
- Come on, Marcus, let's go get her!

1:00:04.142 --> 1:00:06.370
- Tom, so help me...
- Enough with the formalities, Marcus.

1:00:06.394 --> 1:00:07.804
This is me that you're talking to,

1:00:07.854 --> 1:00:09.973
and this is exactly

1:00:10.023 --> 1:00:12.108
what we've been working towards.

1:00:13.943 --> 1:00:15.320
- Unless it's a trap.

1:00:16.529 --> 1:00:19.315
- Unless it's a trap for who exactly?

1:00:19.365 --> 1:00:21.943
Look, if she starts
twitching when we get close,

1:00:21.993 --> 1:00:23.987
we can easily pull away with

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:26.205
just scratches, Marcus.

1:00:27.206 --> 1:00:29.534
We ignore this, and we're missing

1:00:29.584 --> 1:00:32.420
the opportunity of a lifetime.

1:00:43.431 --> 1:00:45.800
- Okay, we'll get in closer,

1:00:45.850 --> 1:00:47.135
and evaluate her condition.

1:00:47.185 --> 1:00:48.728
- Yes, sir!

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:54.142
We're going in to get her.

1:00:54.192 --> 1:00:55.643
I have the Conn.

1:00:55.693 --> 1:00:57.111
Roll starboard 10 degrees.

1:00:58.071 --> 1:00:59.197
Stern up 49.

1:01:00.156 --> 1:01:01.733
10 tips to Port by the bow.

1:01:01.783 --> 1:01:02.567
- Aye, sir.

1:01:02.617 --> 1:01:05.278
- Burn ahead one quarter, 60 seconds.

1:01:05.328 --> 1:01:07.205
- I have the Conn, threat board on two.

1:01:21.928 --> 1:01:23.046
- Captain?

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:25.048
- SepMOD, what's her bearing?

1:01:25.098 --> 1:01:27.642
304 by 355 relative.

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:31.471
- Helm, adjust our approach.

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:32.689
Bring us up on her beam.

1:01:33.815 --> 1:01:35.024
- Adjusting, aye, sir.

1:01:37.276 --> 1:01:38.444
- Captain?

1:01:40.029 --> 1:01:41.114
Yes.

1:01:42.824 --> 1:01:44.367
- May I recommend we hail them?

1:01:45.743 --> 1:01:48.162
- No, radio silence for the time being.

1:01:51.207 --> 1:01:52.625
- Shall we go to quarters?

1:01:57.130 --> 1:01:58.297
- Go to quarters.

1:01:59.424 --> 1:02:00.693
- General quarters, general quarters,

1:02:00.717 --> 1:02:02.085
all hands to battle stations!

1:02:16.899 --> 1:02:18.401
- Ship is at quarters.

1:02:21.529 --> 1:02:25.158
- Chief, bring up the external
on three. Extreme telephoto.

1:02:28.453 --> 1:02:29.829
Light her up.

1:02:34.876 --> 1:02:36.127
Closer.

1:02:49.807 --> 1:02:51.184
- She's huge.

1:02:51.726 --> 1:02:54.429
- SepMOD, do you have a
classification on the target?

1:02:54.479 --> 1:02:56.606
The computer's
still stumbling on it.

1:02:58.733 --> 1:03:01.018
Now it says it could be
a McClarren gray ship.

1:03:01.068 --> 1:03:02.236
- Is it?

1:03:03.196 --> 1:03:04.397
No chance, Captain.

1:03:04.447 --> 1:03:05.398
- Helm, back one quarter.

1:03:05.448 --> 1:03:07.283
Let's not get too close yet.

1:03:11.370 --> 1:03:13.331
She looks derelict.

1:03:13.831 --> 1:03:16.325
- Not necessarily.

1:03:16.375 --> 1:03:17.910
Look at that darkening aft,

1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:20.621
She's taken a couple of serious hits.

1:03:20.671 --> 1:03:23.040
That could be a breach.

1:03:23.090 --> 1:03:25.585
- The airlock looks warped on this side.

1:03:25.635 --> 1:03:26.945
We'd have to approach from the other,

1:03:26.969 --> 1:03:28.846
where she could have taken less damage.

1:04:16.769 --> 1:04:17.769
Gary?

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:21.524
- Some variant on the Viper III mount.

1:04:22.483 --> 1:04:23.601
They're very accurate,

1:04:23.651 --> 1:04:25.128
but the magazines are kept inside the hull

1:04:25.152 --> 1:04:26.604
and the barrels have to be rotated

1:04:26.654 --> 1:04:27.939
perpendicular to the spine

1:04:27.989 --> 1:04:30.241
to line up the feed
slots between every shot.

1:04:31.617 --> 1:04:33.778
Not very good at close quarters.

1:04:33.828 --> 1:04:37.081
- Have the crews of Hydra 1
and Quad mount load specials.

1:04:41.836 --> 1:04:43.788
- Aye, sir.

1:04:43.838 --> 1:04:45.998
Quad mount and Hydra 1.

1:04:46.048 --> 1:04:46.833
- All right.

1:04:46.883 --> 1:04:47.901
Load the specials.

1:04:47.925 --> 1:04:50.711
- Helm, bring us alongside her.

1:04:50.761 --> 1:04:52.505
We'll prepare a boarding action.

1:04:52.555 --> 1:04:53.840
Bring us alongside.

1:04:53.890 --> 1:04:55.258
Aye Sir.

1:05:15.578 --> 1:05:17.446
- Closing at 10 feet per second.

1:05:17.496 --> 1:05:18.581
Coming about.

1:05:22.168 --> 1:05:23.628
- Guns at the ready?

1:05:26.631 --> 1:05:29.000
Contact one
thousand yards and closing.

1:05:29.050 --> 1:05:30.718
Devil's Distance captain.

1:05:32.219 --> 1:05:33.739
- If they were gonna give us any trouble,

1:05:33.763 --> 1:05:35.882
they would have done it by now.

1:05:35.932 --> 1:05:38.851
- Does anybody see any white paint?

1:05:42.855 --> 1:05:44.307
- Maybe they...

1:05:44.357 --> 1:05:45.650
repainted.

1:05:47.860 --> 1:05:50.321
- Let's get a close-up of the bow.

1:05:54.408 --> 1:05:55.910
- That's not recent.

1:05:56.953 --> 1:05:58.988
That's old damage.

1:05:59.038 --> 1:06:00.665
- What's it say?

1:06:03.626 --> 1:06:05.044
- Voltairine?

1:06:06.545 --> 1:06:08.497
- That's not right.

1:06:08.547 --> 1:06:10.541
This isn't right.

1:06:10.591 --> 1:06:12.176
- Go wide again.

1:06:15.054 --> 1:06:16.255
- Chief!

1:06:16.305 --> 1:06:17.574
Lost the input signal, sir.

1:06:17.598 --> 1:06:18.883
Recycling it again.

1:06:20.142 --> 1:06:20.927
- Whoa.

1:06:22.561 --> 1:06:23.771
- What?

1:06:25.439 --> 1:06:27.183
- Chief! What's going on?

1:06:27.233 --> 1:06:28.059
Sir?

1:06:28.109 --> 1:06:29.393
- Chief, what's going on?

1:06:29.443 --> 1:06:31.270
- Guidance thrusters not responding.

1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:32.188
- What?

1:06:32.238 --> 1:06:34.065
- I have no control.

1:06:48.129 --> 1:06:48.913
- Royce!

1:06:48.963 --> 1:06:51.207
- Nothing's working, nothing's working!

1:06:51.257 --> 1:06:52.291
- Did they infiltrate us?

1:06:52.341 --> 1:06:55.836
- They can't have, there was
no signal, no transmission.

1:06:55.886 --> 1:06:56.905
- Gun crews are all reporting

1:06:56.929 --> 1:06:58.073
their controls won't respond.

1:07:04.228 --> 1:07:06.389
- They've set us adrift.

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:07.791
Royce, you have to clean them out!

1:07:07.815 --> 1:07:09.642
- I don't, I'm trying Captain.

1:07:09.692 --> 1:07:11.686
- Not good enough, make it happen.

1:07:11.736 --> 1:07:12.603
- I, I can't!

1:07:12.653 --> 1:07:13.437
- You have to.

1:07:13.487 --> 1:07:14.605
- Marcus!

1:07:14.655 --> 1:07:15.606
Marcus!

1:07:21.328 --> 1:07:23.447
- All engines ahead flank! AHEAD FLANK!

1:07:23.497 --> 1:07:24.782
- I have no control!

1:07:25.666 --> 1:07:26.450
- Gary!

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:29.453
- Do it!

1:07:43.267 --> 1:07:44.885
- We're rolling to port!

1:07:44.935 --> 1:07:46.303
- Fire control's back on line!

1:07:46.353 --> 1:07:48.347
The shock must have tripped something!

1:07:48.397 --> 1:07:49.265
- Helm, all ahead flank!

1:07:49.315 --> 1:07:51.100
- Helm still isn't answering Sir!

1:07:51.984 --> 1:07:53.336
Hydra Twin out of action!

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:55.104
- Quad mount also out of action!

1:07:55.154 --> 1:07:55.938
- Hydra 1...

1:07:55.988 --> 1:07:56.772
- She is not responding, sir!

1:07:56.822 --> 1:07:57.966
The targeting system's damaged.

1:07:57.990 --> 1:07:59.483
- Fire with any working gun we have!

1:07:59.533 --> 1:08:01.277
Patch me through to the crew of Hydra 1.

1:08:01.327 --> 1:08:02.862
- Ed, patch him in! Cobra and Hydra 2,

1:08:02.912 --> 1:08:05.656
rotate 090 relative and bottom out!

1:08:05.706 --> 1:08:06.808
We'll hit her as we come around!

1:08:06.832 --> 1:08:08.159
- Ugh!

1:08:08.209 --> 1:08:10.077
- Gary, I'm gonna give
the crew a Hydra 1 to

1:08:10.127 --> 1:08:11.328
make a manual shot!

1:08:11.378 --> 1:08:12.830
- Aye captain. Hydra 2 and Cobra

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:15.332
target the damaged section on
her stern as we come around,

1:08:15.382 --> 1:08:17.027
- Royce can we do anything
about our targeting system?

1:08:17.051 --> 1:08:18.169
- I can't get any readings.

1:08:18.219 --> 1:08:19.879
It's like there's nothing there to spoof.

1:08:19.929 --> 1:08:21.297
- Hit the button again.

1:08:21.347 --> 1:08:22.631
Now!

1:08:33.609 --> 1:08:35.319
- Hydra 2 coming around.

1:08:38.364 --> 1:08:39.190
Firing!

1:08:40.616 --> 1:08:42.276
We missed!

1:08:42.326 --> 1:08:43.611
- Cobra, you're up!

1:08:43.661 --> 1:08:44.820
- Yes sir!

1:08:44.870 --> 1:08:46.822
- Royce, hold that button down.

1:08:46.872 --> 1:08:48.741
Hold it down I said!

1:08:50.376 --> 1:08:51.786
- Hydra 1, prepare to fire.

1:09:03.389 --> 1:09:05.549
- Sir, I've got burnouts
all across the board.

1:09:05.599 --> 1:09:07.593
Something's drawing too much power!

1:09:07.643 --> 1:09:09.678
- Safety override. Reactors to 150.

1:09:09.728 --> 1:09:11.847
Pull the stops. Now!

1:09:14.441 --> 1:09:15.392
- Steady now.

1:09:15.442 --> 1:09:16.644
- We got this.

1:09:32.293 --> 1:09:34.036
Fire! Tear me a hole right through her!

1:09:34.086 --> 1:09:35.371
Firing!

1:09:38.299 --> 1:09:39.466
- Hydra 1...

1:09:40.384 --> 1:09:41.510
Fire!

1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:12.809
And we've done it again!

1:10:12.833 --> 1:10:15.119
Shut her off!

1:10:19.006 --> 1:10:22.551
Conn, target has
broken into two pieces.

1:10:23.427 --> 1:10:25.880
Both are drifting away from us.

1:10:30.434 --> 1:10:31.894
- Reactor status.

1:10:33.187 --> 1:10:35.514
- Reactors are holding stable.

1:10:35.564 --> 1:10:37.266
- We're all right.

1:10:37.316 --> 1:10:38.601
We're okay.

1:10:38.651 --> 1:10:40.269
- Alive, at any rate.

1:10:40.319 --> 1:10:41.562
Check for damage.

1:10:41.612 --> 1:10:42.688
- Aye sir.

1:10:44.907 --> 1:10:47.651
Looks like the fat lady called it a day.

1:10:47.701 --> 1:10:50.571
- You're a dork Salles.

1:10:55.334 --> 1:10:56.627
- Are you all right captain?

1:10:57.586 --> 1:10:59.830
Can you receive a damage report?

1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:01.340
- Kill the alarm.

1:11:02.424 --> 1:11:05.135
All compartments, report damage to LSO.

1:11:09.473 --> 1:11:11.675
We shouldn't have been
able to survive that.

1:11:11.725 --> 1:11:13.802
- No, we shouldn't.

1:11:13.852 --> 1:11:16.055
It was Royce on the MFC.

1:11:16.105 --> 1:11:18.015
Without the Testudo we'd
have had hull breaches

1:11:18.065 --> 1:11:19.775
with the first hits.

1:11:21.944 --> 1:11:25.272
His presence of mind just
saved all of our lives.

1:11:25.322 --> 1:11:28.325
And without his quick thinking,
we'd all be finished...

1:11:32.454 --> 1:11:35.374
The pressure
doors are still open!

1:11:40.713 --> 1:11:43.340
- I need to see how much of
my ship is still working.

1:12:18.292 --> 1:12:19.952
Hull breach.

1:12:20.002 --> 1:12:22.296
Hull breach. Hull breach.

1:12:23.172 --> 1:12:24.748
Releasing sealing agent.

1:12:28.677 --> 1:12:30.504
Hull breach.

1:12:30.554 --> 1:12:32.181
Sealing pressure doors.

1:12:33.891 --> 1:12:35.217
- What is going on?

1:12:35.267 --> 1:12:36.885
What is happening to my ship?

1:12:36.935 --> 1:12:38.204
- We're breached aft in engineering.

1:12:38.228 --> 1:12:40.180
They've been sealed off.

1:12:40.230 --> 1:12:41.249
- Ventilate them. They need air!

1:12:41.273 --> 1:12:43.460
- Captain, the back pressure
will bleed the entire system.

1:12:43.484 --> 1:12:44.893
We'll all depressurize!

1:12:44.943 --> 1:12:46.478
- Use O2 tank 3!

1:12:46.528 --> 1:12:48.548
Dump the entire thing into
the chamber of wholesale.

1:12:48.572 --> 1:12:49.815
Come on!

1:12:49.865 --> 1:12:51.200
- Sven!

1:12:52.284 --> 1:12:53.410
Sve...

1:12:55.496 --> 1:12:57.114
SCRAM the reactor!

1:12:57.164 --> 1:12:58.374
SCRA...

1:12:59.208 --> 1:13:00.909
- Salles!

1:13:00.959 --> 1:13:02.661
The breach will be sealed in a moment.

1:13:10.969 --> 1:13:12.838
- Fire in engineering!

1:13:14.348 --> 1:13:16.392
- Belay oxygen. Release CO2.

1:13:20.729 --> 1:13:22.639
- It's not releasing.

1:13:27.861 --> 1:13:29.980
Hull breach sealed.

1:13:30.030 --> 1:13:30.814
- Salles!

1:13:33.575 --> 1:13:36.820
I need you to get on the CO2.

1:13:48.882 --> 1:13:49.925
- Go!

1:13:55.931 --> 1:13:57.933
- Is there anything else that we can do?

1:13:58.809 --> 1:14:00.677
- Nothing.

1:14:00.727 --> 1:14:03.305
If they can't get that fire out.

1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:26.912
Reactor SCRAM.

1:14:26.962 --> 1:14:28.130
Reactor SCRAM.

1:14:32.301 --> 1:14:33.585
Reactor SCRAM.

1:15:16.595 --> 1:15:18.338
We're on auxiliary power.

1:15:18.388 --> 1:15:19.756
I think the fire is out, captain.

1:15:19.806 --> 1:15:21.308
- Release the oxygen!

1:15:33.570 --> 1:15:35.189
- Salles, you all right?

1:15:35.239 --> 1:15:37.157
Come on, you all right?

1:15:38.742 --> 1:15:39.910
Its all right.

1:15:41.787 --> 1:15:42.988
- Talk to me. Come on.

1:15:43.038 --> 1:15:43.822
- I have to help.

1:15:43.872 --> 1:15:45.666
- No! No! There's nothing you can do!

1:15:45.958 --> 1:15:47.292
Let me go!

1:15:56.927 --> 1:15:58.345
- It's all right.

1:15:59.346 --> 1:16:00.346
Easy.

1:16:01.306 --> 1:16:03.300
- He's sleeping.

1:16:03.350 --> 1:16:04.518
- Yeah.

1:16:06.436 --> 1:16:09.606
- He's... he's sleeping...

1:16:27.624 --> 1:16:30.919
The hull breach
is temporarily patched,

1:16:31.837 --> 1:16:32.996
but we need a drydock before

1:16:33.046 --> 1:16:35.007
we can reasonably go into combat again.

1:16:35.591 --> 1:16:37.709
All five rail gun mounts are nonresponsive

1:16:37.759 --> 1:16:39.344
since that last hit.

1:16:40.846 --> 1:16:42.965
Auxiliary fuel tanks are destroyed.

1:16:43.015 --> 1:16:44.474
That's what started the fire.

1:16:46.351 --> 1:16:48.512
We're running in limited
capacity on battery backup,

1:16:48.562 --> 1:16:49.638
which...

1:16:49.688 --> 1:16:51.390
- Won't give us enough power to maneuver.

1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:53.141
Move on.

1:16:53.191 --> 1:16:55.435
11 men are dead, 15 wounded,

1:16:55.485 --> 1:16:57.771
and only three of the
engine crew survived.

1:16:57.821 --> 1:17:00.816
All the computers crashed in
the switchover to battery.

1:17:00.866 --> 1:17:02.218
Some of the systems have re-booted,

1:17:02.242 --> 1:17:04.152
but others are just gone.

1:17:04.202 --> 1:17:06.389
The good news is whatever got
into our thruster control,

1:17:06.413 --> 1:17:09.249
seems to have been flushed
out by the system crash.

1:17:15.589 --> 1:17:16.590
- Okay.

1:17:18.675 --> 1:17:19.926
Tell me bad part.

1:17:21.011 --> 1:17:23.255
- The SSD has taken significant damage

1:17:23.305 --> 1:17:27.551
and, Tamai's obviously not up
to repairing or operating it.

1:17:27.601 --> 1:17:28.601
And no one else on board

1:17:28.644 --> 1:17:30.604
has his knowledge or experience.

1:17:32.648 --> 1:17:34.149
- We can't go home.

1:17:36.276 --> 1:17:37.311
This is a disaster.

1:17:37.361 --> 1:17:38.145
- Marcus.

1:17:38.195 --> 1:17:39.563
- It wasn't even the right ship!

1:17:39.613 --> 1:17:41.573
- You should be proud of your crew sir.

1:17:42.407 --> 1:17:43.609
Whoever the Voltairine was,

1:17:43.659 --> 1:17:44.886
she would have preyed on others,

1:17:44.910 --> 1:17:46.653
possibly our allies.

1:17:46.703 --> 1:17:49.623
We lost some good men but that
happens in this profession.

1:17:50.582 --> 1:17:51.582
Sir...

1:17:53.794 --> 1:17:55.379
you should be proud of them all.

1:18:00.133 --> 1:18:03.261
- I suppose we've done
our part in this search.

1:18:08.433 --> 1:18:10.260
Reactor is critical.

1:18:10.310 --> 1:18:12.387
Reactor is critical.

1:18:12.437 --> 1:18:15.607
All engines ready to,
begin standard maneuvers.

1:18:16.692 --> 1:18:18.602
- There's the real good news.

1:18:18.652 --> 1:18:20.395
The reactor was somehow undamaged.

1:18:20.445 --> 1:18:21.839
It looks like our surviving crew members

1:18:21.863 --> 1:18:23.615
were able to get it up and running.

1:18:26.284 --> 1:18:27.703
Will you take the Conn?

1:18:35.335 --> 1:18:37.254
- Give me five minutes.

1:18:45.178 --> 1:18:46.588
- How about you Tom?

1:18:46.638 --> 1:18:47.973
Are you holding up?

1:18:48.890 --> 1:18:51.309
- Oh yes! I'm just fine!

1:18:52.769 --> 1:18:55.347
You're right. This is a disaster.

1:18:55.397 --> 1:18:56.640
It's my disaster.

1:18:56.690 --> 1:18:57.474
- Oh, knock it off!

1:18:57.524 --> 1:18:58.668
- I just thought that you should make

1:18:58.692 --> 1:19:00.686
a real decision for once!

1:19:00.736 --> 1:19:02.437
- And I did.

1:19:02.487 --> 1:19:04.114
And I have to live with it.

1:19:05.198 --> 1:19:06.450
You don't.

1:19:11.788 --> 1:19:14.207
Pull yourself together and have a drink.

1:19:32.601 --> 1:19:34.352
- How about the navigation systems?

1:19:35.604 --> 1:19:37.189
- What? Oh.

1:19:38.231 --> 1:19:39.691
Completely dead.

1:19:40.692 --> 1:19:42.486
I can still do manual plots.

1:19:43.904 --> 1:19:45.313
I'll get us into port.

1:19:45.363 --> 1:19:47.616
- You'll have to get us home after that.

1:19:50.243 --> 1:19:54.281
- You want me to calculate
a transition, by hand.

1:19:54.331 --> 1:19:57.367
- Proper help is unlikely to
present itself at St. Nishith.

1:19:57.417 --> 1:19:59.786
Equipment to repair the drive, maybe,

1:19:59.836 --> 1:20:01.913
but personnel, I think not.

1:20:01.963 --> 1:20:04.249
- But I barely even
scrapped those classes.

1:20:04.299 --> 1:20:06.042
And without Dennis here to run the drive,

1:20:06.092 --> 1:20:07.627
If we can even get It fixed...

1:20:07.677 --> 1:20:09.797
- Then you'd better break
out the displacement manual.

1:20:09.846 --> 1:20:12.090
Work with Gary on this.

1:20:12.140 --> 1:20:13.008
We're gonna need a second

1:20:13.058 --> 1:20:15.427
just in case something happens to you.

1:20:15.477 --> 1:20:16.803
Not Gary, Kai.

1:20:16.853 --> 1:20:19.356
Gary will be busy unsticking the guns.

1:20:22.526 --> 1:20:25.812
It'll be at least two weeks
until we reach The Fell.

1:20:25.862 --> 1:20:27.689
Just long enough, to get used to the idea

1:20:27.739 --> 1:20:29.191
of becoming an Arkwright.

1:20:29.241 --> 1:20:30.025
- Marcus.

1:20:30.075 --> 1:20:30.859
- Don't call me Marcus.

1:20:30.909 --> 1:20:32.661
Get on it right away.

1:21:01.690 --> 1:21:03.775
- Your orders, captain?

1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:14.661
- Helm,

1:21:15.704 --> 1:21:17.372
come to course 185,

1:21:18.373 --> 1:21:20.325
by 046.

1:21:20.375 --> 1:21:22.252
Roll angle 31 degrees.

1:21:23.587 --> 1:21:25.463
Best safe speed to St. Nishith.

1:21:26.798 --> 1:21:28.041
Aye sir.

1:21:28.091 --> 1:21:30.468
Course, 185 by 046.

1:21:32.095 --> 1:21:33.847
Roll angle 31 degrees.

1:21:35.098 --> 1:21:36.308
Thrusting ahead.
