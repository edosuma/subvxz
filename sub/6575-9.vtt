00:23.000 --> 00:26.769
- Hello, Megan.
I'm on Earth.

00:26.837 --> 00:29.272
But how did I get to Earth?

00:29.339 --> 00:32.107
Why am I wearing
this costume?

00:32.176 --> 00:34.877
And why does my head hurt
so much?

00:37.414 --> 00:38.514
Is this a dream?

00:47.024 --> 00:49.525
- Wait. I've seen that symbol.

00:49.593 --> 00:52.095
Are you Superman?

00:55.532 --> 00:57.300
Aah!

01:10.614 --> 01:14.717
- Not a dream.
A nightmare.

Young Justice, Season 1, Episode 9
"Bereft"

02:02.466 --> 02:05.401
- Those are bialyan
Republican Army uniforms.

02:05.469 --> 02:09.071
But what are bialyans doing
in, uh, Bialya?

02:09.139 --> 02:11.073
Ok. Better question--

02:11.141 --> 02:13.910
What am I doing
in Bialya?

02:13.977 --> 02:16.412
In September?
What happened to March?

02:16.480 --> 02:17.914
Better radio Batman.

02:17.981 --> 02:21.317
- Maintain radio silence
at all times.

02:21.385 --> 02:24.053
- Or not.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.535
- Hey. You. Wake up.

02:45.509 --> 02:47.810
hey, it's ok. It's ok.

02:47.878 --> 02:50.313
I won't hurt you.
I'm one of the good guys.

02:50.380 --> 02:52.348
You know, Kid Flash.

02:52.416 --> 02:55.751
- Seen Kid Flash on the news.
He doesn't wear black.

02:56.887 --> 02:59.255
- A little unclear
on that myself.

02:59.323 --> 03:02.024
What about you?
Green Arrow fixation?

03:02.092 --> 03:04.627
- Who put me in this?

03:04.695 --> 03:08.464
- Wow. I am not touching that
with a 10-foot--uh--

03:08.532 --> 03:10.967
So, you know
how to use that bow?

03:11.034 --> 03:12.969
- Yeah. My dad taught me.

03:13.036 --> 03:15.638
Dad. He must have done this.

03:15.706 --> 03:17.506
Another of
his stupid tests.

03:17.574 --> 03:18.774
- What kind of test?

03:18.842 --> 03:21.110
- He probably wants me
to kill you.

03:37.060 --> 03:40.062
<i>Don't let them escape.</i>

03:58.148 --> 04:00.416
- Sorry.
They've got bigger arrows.

04:05.322 --> 04:08.024
- Thanks.
- Hey, I told you, good guy.

04:08.091 --> 04:10.693
Now, not to pry,
but what's your name?

04:10.761 --> 04:13.329
Oh, and what's this
about you killing me?

04:15.666 --> 04:17.266
I'm actually on Earth!

04:17.334 --> 04:19.267
I've wanted this
for so long...

04:19.336 --> 04:22.238
Even if
it's not exactly like tv.

04:23.307 --> 04:26.275
But why can't I remember
how I got here?

04:27.778 --> 04:30.246
Concentrate.

04:30.314 --> 04:32.148
Remember.

04:36.019 --> 04:38.287
- Good idea. Go.
- Be careful.

04:38.355 --> 04:40.056
- Careful, Superboy.
They're hot.

04:40.123 --> 04:42.458
- Not as hot as you, babe.

04:42.526 --> 04:45.728
- Thanks, Wally.
That's, um, sweet.

04:45.796 --> 04:47.730
- Mmm. Not as sweet
as you, sugar.

04:47.798 --> 04:49.732
- Oh, grow up.
- Ow!

04:49.800 --> 04:52.368
- Team, report to
the mission room.

04:52.436 --> 04:54.437
- I'm on a team!

04:54.504 --> 04:55.771
I have friends!

04:55.839 --> 04:58.941
And a Superboy
who might be...

04:59.009 --> 05:00.976
I need to find him.
Them.

05:01.044 --> 05:03.979
hello? Um, team?

05:04.047 --> 05:06.949
Maybe they're
just out of my range.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.425
Sorry. Running on empty.

05:16.493 --> 05:19.028
Don't think I've eaten
in a while.

05:20.030 --> 05:21.897
Been out here over 24 hours.

05:21.965 --> 05:23.599
Or my cupboards
wouldn't be bare.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.801
- Aah!

05:38.915 --> 05:41.150
Aah!

05:41.218 --> 05:43.886
Superboy! Where are you?

06:11.782 --> 06:13.048
- Whose side
is he on?

06:13.116 --> 06:15.151
- Want to stick around
and find out?

06:30.934 --> 06:32.201
- Get down!

06:38.341 --> 06:40.176
Don't worry, I'm almost there!

06:42.879 --> 06:45.147
- Did you just hear
a girl talking in your head?

06:45.215 --> 06:46.916
- Girls are always
on my mind.

06:46.983 --> 06:48.818
But they're
not usually talking.

06:57.627 --> 07:00.362
- Well, J'onn,
the costume looks familiar,

07:00.430 --> 07:03.599
But I'm not sure the new bod
screams "Manhunter."

07:03.667 --> 07:05.267
- You know
my uncle J'onn?

07:05.335 --> 07:09.171
Hello, Megan, of course you do.
You're Kid Flash. Wally.

07:09.239 --> 07:11.006
And you're Artemis.
- Wait, wait, wait.

07:11.074 --> 07:14.577
Martian Manhunter's your uncle?
Is that how you know my name?

07:14.644 --> 07:16.412
- Your name is
really Wally?

07:16.480 --> 07:17.713
- Ohh.

07:17.781 --> 07:21.450
- It's ok. We're teammates.
Friends. I made you cookies.

07:21.518 --> 07:22.952
- You know her?

07:23.019 --> 07:25.588
- I swear, beautiful, never seen
her before in my life. At least--

07:25.655 --> 07:29.325
- you both lost
your memories, too.

07:32.362 --> 07:34.029
Come on.
I'll fill you in as we go.

07:34.097 --> 07:35.531
Robin and Superboy
need our help.

07:35.599 --> 07:39.401
- Of course.
Robin and super what now?

07:47.644 --> 07:49.512
- You must control
his mind.

07:49.579 --> 07:53.749
- Doesn't seem to be much mind
in there left to control.

07:53.817 --> 07:56.652
But...Be still.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.370
- Wish I could remember
why I put a gps marker here.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.874
Huh! Guessing that's why.

08:39.585 --> 08:42.787
<i>Her Majesty wants him alive!</i>

08:58.637 --> 09:01.139
<i>Enough! Open fire!</i>

09:02.742 --> 09:05.276
- I'll hold that. Thanks!

09:26.732 --> 09:29.768
- K.F.! Man, it's good
to see a familiar face.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.803
- Hey, Rob. Memory loss?

09:31.871 --> 09:33.404
- 6 months.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.040
Let's hogtie these creeps
and compare notes.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.576
So we're a team?

09:38.644 --> 09:40.645
- The 4 of us and Superboy.

09:40.713 --> 09:44.315
- Then this must be his.
- Yes! Did you see him?

09:44.383 --> 09:46.317
- I think we did.
- Feral boy?

09:46.385 --> 09:48.086
Some teammate.
He attacked us.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.754
- He didn't know
who we are.

09:49.822 --> 09:51.322
I don't know
who we are.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.325
- I remember Batman ordering
radio silence.

09:54.393 --> 09:56.060
Our team must work
for him.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.496
- How do you know
we don't work for my mentor?

09:58.564 --> 10:01.366
Whoa.
This is so cool!

10:03.836 --> 10:06.437
- We look ridiculous.

10:06.505 --> 10:08.339
Quit touching yourself.

10:08.407 --> 10:12.010
we need our memories back.

10:12.077 --> 10:14.245
to help Superboy.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.019
- I brought you
into my mind

10:21.086 --> 10:23.154
To share
what I've remembered so far.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.989
But I need your help.
Together,

10:25.057 --> 10:27.158
Our broken memories
can form a whole,

10:27.226 --> 10:29.994
If you open
your minds to mine.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.230
- You want to paw through
our private thoughts?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.998
- I have no wish to intrude,
but--

10:34.066 --> 10:36.801
- We need to hack our minds to grok
what happened to us. Got it. Go.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.369
- My brain's all yours.

10:38.437 --> 10:40.371
Try not to let its brilliance
overwhelm you.

10:40.439 --> 10:41.806
- Or underwhelm you.

10:41.874 --> 10:44.008
Hey, why isn't anyone
ever just whelmed?

10:48.881 --> 10:53.051
- Tast 6 months only,
and only what you need.

11:00.693 --> 11:04.963
- The watchtower detected an immense
power surge in the bialyan desert.

11:05.030 --> 11:09.200
Spectral analysis revealed
elements non-terrestrial in origin.

11:09.268 --> 11:12.837
Find out what happened
at that site, what landed there.

11:12.905 --> 11:15.907
Bialya is a rogue state
ruled by Queen Bee,

11:15.975 --> 11:18.676
And not a member of
the League's U.N. Charter.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.679
All communications are subject
to interseption.

11:21.747 --> 11:24.716
Maintain radio silence
at all times.

11:24.783 --> 11:27.685
You'll land in Kourak
on Bialya's border,

11:27.753 --> 11:30.922
2 clicks from the hot zone.
- All clear.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.825
- The bialyans control
the site.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.196
- Set up here.

11:40.566 --> 11:43.134
- We'll be up and running
in no time.

11:43.202 --> 11:46.871
- Jackpot! The site's lousy
with zeta beam radiation.

11:46.939 --> 11:49.474
- Detecting non-terrestrial
trace elements from the tent.

11:49.541 --> 11:51.209
- I'll check it out
in camouflage mode.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.810
- Good idea. Go.

11:54.413 --> 11:57.015
- Careful.
- And maintain telepathic contact.

11:57.082 --> 11:58.616
- I will, Aqualad.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.785
Aqualad!

12:00.853 --> 12:02.754
- Where is he?
What happened next?

12:02.821 --> 12:06.224
- I don't know! That's the
last thing I--we remember.

12:06.292 --> 12:09.093
- Ehh.
We landed 24 hours ago.

12:09.161 --> 12:11.496
If Kaldur'ahm's been wandering
the desert that long, well,

12:11.563 --> 12:13.231
That's not good
for a guy with gills.

12:13.299 --> 12:14.899
- Now that I know
to look for him...

12:14.967 --> 12:17.802
He's close!
But he's not moving.

12:27.646 --> 12:29.647
- Raise to shock level 4.

12:42.861 --> 12:46.030
- Fascinating.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.504
- I can't restore his memories
in this condition.

12:53.572 --> 12:56.174
- He needs immediate
rehydration. Call the bioship.

12:56.241 --> 12:58.509
- It's out of range,
but you can get him there fast.

12:58.577 --> 13:01.546
- He's too heavy,
and I'm too low on fuel.

13:01.613 --> 13:04.315
Right now,
I couldn't even carry her.

13:04.383 --> 13:07.552
- why not
just levitate him back?

13:07.619 --> 13:09.887
- I can't.
I have to find Superboy.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.956
- 6 months ago,
he didn't exist.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.726
He has no memories--
just animal impulse.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.327
I'm the only one
who can help him.

13:16.395 --> 13:19.630
- Superboy's indestructible.
Just ask those tanks.

13:19.698 --> 13:21.566
It's Aqualad
who needs your help.

13:21.633 --> 13:22.700
Like, now.

13:25.371 --> 13:29.240
- No! Superboy's in pain!
We can't wait!

13:29.308 --> 13:31.409
- We still don't know
what erased our memories!

13:31.477 --> 13:33.711
It could happen again!

13:53.532 --> 13:55.466
Aah!

13:57.369 --> 13:59.237
Well...

13:59.304 --> 14:02.140
Someone's certainly
a glutton for punishment.

14:02.207 --> 14:06.511
Psimon says...Forget.

14:17.680 --> 14:22.216
- That's it.
Forget like before.

14:22.284 --> 14:24.786
before.

14:26.889 --> 14:29.390
- I'm in.
- Good, but tread carefully.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.359
Camouflage
is not invisible.

14:31.427 --> 14:34.462
- They're testing something.

14:34.530 --> 14:37.465
To make someone
in pain.

14:37.533 --> 14:39.467
Hello?
Can you hear me?

14:39.535 --> 14:40.968
- I can...

14:41.036 --> 14:43.571
And an open mind is
a dangerous thing.

14:43.639 --> 14:44.839
- Someone's hacked our link!

14:44.907 --> 14:48.309
- Psimon can't see you.
Psimon can't catch you.

14:48.377 --> 14:52.847
But Psimon can
make you all forget!

15:05.661 --> 15:06.761
- No.

15:06.829 --> 15:09.564
I won't let it happen again.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.102
- Not really your call,
little girl.

15:23.679 --> 15:26.247
- Quick, over there.

15:36.625 --> 15:39.193
Shh. Kaldur'ahm,
quiet now.

15:41.196 --> 15:44.298
- We can't risk a firefight
with Aqualad koed like this.

15:44.366 --> 15:46.667
it's not just him.

15:46.735 --> 15:48.336
I'm way out of juice.

15:48.403 --> 15:50.271
- And I'm almost
out of arrows.

15:50.339 --> 15:54.208
- Ugh. I forgot how much I hate
it when he does the ninja thing.

15:54.276 --> 15:57.044
Hey, you never said why your dad
would want you to ktttk! Me.

15:57.112 --> 16:01.048
- I got confused by some old
movie I saw the other night.

16:01.116 --> 16:03.451
About a ninja girl
whose ninja dad ordered her

16:03.519 --> 16:06.654
To kill her ninja boyfriend 'cause
he was from a rival ninja clan.

16:06.722 --> 16:09.390
- So, I'm your ninja boyfriend,
huh?

16:09.458 --> 16:11.559
- Hey, amnesia,
remember?

16:11.627 --> 16:14.529
Completely forgot
how truly annoying you are.

16:14.596 --> 16:16.597
- Oh, like you're
the goddess of congeniality.

16:16.665 --> 16:18.766
- Yeesh.
Get a room.

16:18.834 --> 16:20.268
- Dude, where were you?

16:20.335 --> 16:22.103
- Breaking radio silence.

16:31.346 --> 16:33.548
- That's our cue. Move!

16:36.385 --> 16:38.419
- You have potential,

16:38.487 --> 16:41.656
But you're too raw,
too untrained.

16:41.723 --> 16:45.159
And not at all
in my League.

16:53.402 --> 16:56.070
- Hey, mr. Psimon,
are you all right?

17:31.707 --> 17:33.107
- You're here!

17:35.177 --> 17:37.445
You sound so relieved.

17:37.512 --> 17:41.382
Is that mindless creature
supposed to save your mind?

17:41.450 --> 17:45.286
- No. I save his.

17:48.724 --> 17:50.391
- We are trying
to help you!

17:50.459 --> 17:54.295
- I was just trying to be part of the team.
- You did all right.

17:56.732 --> 17:59.500
Get onboard,
or get out of the way.

17:59.568 --> 18:02.303
- Hey, Superboy,
come meet miss m.

18:02.371 --> 18:04.872
Hello, Megan.

18:04.940 --> 18:07.508
- We'll, uh, we'll figure
something out for you.

18:07.576 --> 18:10.912
The League will, I mean.
Duty calls.

18:13.248 --> 18:17.718
- The watchtower detected an immense
power surge in bialyan desert.

18:17.786 --> 18:19.487
- Forget.

18:26.895 --> 18:28.663
- So sorry. I should
have paid more attention.

18:28.730 --> 18:30.431
It was too much at once.
Too much at once. Heh.

18:30.499 --> 18:32.500
Hello, Megan!
That's so me.

18:32.567 --> 18:34.702
I...

18:37.739 --> 18:39.240
- Kick his butt.

18:40.676 --> 18:43.678
By all means.

18:43.745 --> 18:46.414
Kick my psychic butt.

18:53.889 --> 18:56.557
- Uh, thanks?

19:25.187 --> 19:26.354
Oh!

19:39.768 --> 19:41.736
- M'gann!

19:44.006 --> 19:45.506
- He's too strong.

19:46.541 --> 19:49.443
- You're strong,
and I'm stubborn.

19:49.511 --> 19:52.580
Together.
- Together.

19:55.951 --> 19:59.954
Get...Out...Of my head.

20:37.826 --> 20:39.660
- Can I keep it?

20:45.967 --> 20:47.902
I've got Superboy.

20:47.969 --> 20:50.471
He's back to normal,
and we're on our way.

20:50.539 --> 20:54.175
- who are you, and
how did you get inside my head?

20:54.242 --> 20:57.578
- Hello, Megan.
Aqualad's memories!

20:57.646 --> 20:59.246
I knew I forgot something.

20:59.314 --> 21:02.750
- Aw, man. Me, too. I didn't
get a souvenir from the mission.

21:02.818 --> 21:06.053
- Don't worry.
Got the souvenir thing covered.

21:15.831 --> 21:20.534
- The Martian girl escaped with
both the sphere and the Super Boy.

21:20.602 --> 21:22.803
- That hardly matters.

21:22.871 --> 21:24.872
What matters is
the successful test

21:24.940 --> 21:27.508
Of our new partner's
delivery system.

21:33.181 --> 21:35.449
More tech will come,

21:35.517 --> 21:39.787
Tech that will put the sphere,
and perhaps even the Super Boy,

21:39.855 --> 21:41.889
To shame.
