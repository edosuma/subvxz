00:56.423 --> 00:58.923
Huh? At last,

00:58.925 --> 01:01.759
Grundy find magic staff.

01:01.761 --> 01:05.598
Now, Grundy rule world.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.076
Huh?

01:24.284 --> 01:27.085
Stop, Grundy! You're defacing a
fragile and valuable piece of history.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.354
Give up now before
you do any more damage.

01:30.356 --> 01:34.727
Damage?
Grundy show you damage.

01:55.381 --> 01:56.850
Huh?

02:14.734 --> 02:19.606
Tank strong. Grundy stronger!

02:41.127 --> 02:42.595
Grundy.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.772
Oh!

02:59.679 --> 03:02.046
Solomon Grundy,
born on a Monday,

03:02.048 --> 03:05.950
busted on a Tuesday
for defacing ancient ruins.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.720
Valuable artifacts like that
staff belong somewhere safe,

03:09.722 --> 03:12.592
and I know just the
place to put it.

03:14.093 --> 03:16.794
I'd like to thank
our benefactor, Mr. Wayne,

03:16.796 --> 03:19.163
for this wonderful addition
to the museum.

03:19.165 --> 03:22.967
It's nice to see the Wayne
family name continue to inspire

03:22.969 --> 03:25.203
and benefit the citizens
of Gotham.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.241
Mr. Wayne, a few words, please.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.978
Thank you for coming.

03:34.814 --> 03:38.251
Oh, um, thank you, Mr. Wayne.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.320
Mr. Wayne,
Billy Batson with WHIZ.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.922
Whiz? Oh, the bathroom
is around the corner...

03:44.924 --> 03:46.390
Uh, that's not what I meant.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.792
Mr. Wayne, would you care
to comment on the rumors

03:47.794 --> 03:49.227
that you're dating
Selina Kyle?

03:49.229 --> 03:50.795
No.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.129
No, you aren't, or, no,
you don't wanna comment?

03:52.131 --> 03:54.298
- Pick one.
- Uh, what about this?

03:54.300 --> 03:57.301
Rumor has it your former ward
Jason Todd has been missing...

03:57.303 --> 03:58.636
Ah-ha!

04:00.039 --> 04:02.106
What about the rumor
that Wayne Enterprises

04:02.108 --> 04:04.108
has a brand-new technology that
will revolutionize automation?

04:04.110 --> 04:05.910
Is it true that you like
the color blue?

04:05.912 --> 04:08.679
Also, can you spare $5
for a metro ticket?

04:15.154 --> 04:16.853
Sweet.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.223
Ugh, why didn't I say 10?

04:19.225 --> 04:22.293
In my day,
the paparazzi had manners,

04:22.295 --> 04:27.365
and little cards that said "Press"
in the hat band of their fedoras.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.766
To the Batcave, Alfred.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.635
I've been distracted
from my war on crime

04:30.637 --> 04:32.737
for five minutes
and 30 seconds.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.606
No telling what evil
has cropped up in that time.

04:35.608 --> 04:40.211
I'm afraid Gotham will have to survive
a bit longer without you, Master Bruce.

04:40.213 --> 04:43.848
There's a meeting at Wayne Enterprises
that demands your attention.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.317
- Reschedule it.
- I have.

04:46.319 --> 04:47.685
Ten times.

04:47.687 --> 04:51.656
Ugh, being Bruce Wayne
is the worst.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.158
Sorry, old friend,
crimefighting wins.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.559
I'm old,

04:55.561 --> 04:57.163
but not that old.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.776
Is that Mr. Wayne?

05:10.610 --> 05:12.245
Is that Mr. Wayne?

05:13.913 --> 05:15.613
That's Bruce Wayne.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.615
Honestly, I thought
he was dead.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.417
Honestly, I thought
he'd be taller.

05:19.419 --> 05:22.119
Which is weird because
we're all the same size.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.762
Wow.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.202
Sir, we're ready for you
in the boardroom.

05:38.204 --> 05:40.638
More like,
"Bored out of my mind room."

05:40.640 --> 05:43.574
- Excuse me?
- Uh, I said, "I look forward to it."

05:49.882 --> 05:52.817
Time is money.
What do you got?

05:52.819 --> 05:55.086
I'm sorry,
what did you say?

05:55.088 --> 05:59.058
I said,
"Let's start the meeting."

06:00.126 --> 06:01.461
Go, go.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.994
Mr. Wayne,

06:03.996 --> 06:05.696
I know your time is precious,

06:05.698 --> 06:09.035
but, boy, do we have something
great in store for you.

06:12.171 --> 06:13.504
Okay, uh...

06:13.506 --> 06:15.840
Well, we've been developing
a new piece of technology

06:15.842 --> 06:18.309
that will
revolutionize Gotham.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.144
And, hey, the world.

06:20.146 --> 06:23.416
Let me introduce,
"Brother Eye."

06:25.318 --> 06:27.017
It's a red light.

06:27.019 --> 06:30.287
No, no.
It's not just a red light.

06:30.289 --> 06:31.856
It's so much more.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.225
An example. Brother Eye,

06:34.227 --> 06:36.227
what is the weather
like outside?

06:36.229 --> 06:38.264
It's sunny outside.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.432
Yes, it's sunny.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.033
Bravo. What else does it do?

06:43.035 --> 06:44.735
It can do almost anything.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.773
Uh, we have...

06:50.042 --> 06:53.413
Um, should I...

06:55.214 --> 06:58.983
Well, Brother Eye is connected
to the rest of the city.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.519
It controls all of
Wayne Enterprises' machinery

07:01.521 --> 07:05.890
including trains, airliners,
traffic lights and more.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.825
In fact,
within the other room,

07:07.827 --> 07:10.060
we have a Brother Eye
automation factory

07:10.062 --> 07:12.830
creating OMAC drones that
can work on the app's behalf.

07:12.832 --> 07:16.967
Oh, and in case you were wondering
what OMAC stands for, it's easy.

07:16.969 --> 07:20.037
Omni Mind and Community.

07:20.039 --> 07:21.405
Water, sir?

07:21.407 --> 07:22.540
Sparkling.

07:22.542 --> 07:23.774
Uh...

07:25.445 --> 07:28.979
Using a dormant satellite of
Wayne Enterprises' in orbit,

07:28.981 --> 07:31.215
we can cut the workforce
by hundreds.

07:31.217 --> 07:34.452
But don't worry, we have a plan
to absorb those employees...

07:35.855 --> 07:37.521
Bank robbery. Yes!

07:37.523 --> 07:39.926
This looks like a job for...

07:45.131 --> 07:46.430
No.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.435
People in danger.

07:51.437 --> 07:55.975
It's time that
Batman leapt into... Action.

07:58.544 --> 07:59.846
Hmm?

08:03.382 --> 08:04.882
Continue.

08:04.884 --> 08:07.117
Uh, as I was saying,

08:07.119 --> 08:10.287
Brother Eye is already
linked to all of Gotham city.

08:10.289 --> 08:13.891
Since Wayne Enterprises is a
part of all major aspects...

09:02.942 --> 09:04.875
Mr. Wayne?

09:04.877 --> 09:07.044
- Mr. Wayne?
- Uh...

09:09.849 --> 09:11.482
Yes, what? Sorry?

09:11.484 --> 09:13.119
Uh, what do you think?

09:13.986 --> 09:16.088
What do I think about...

09:16.622 --> 09:18.455
Brother Eye?

09:18.457 --> 09:20.858
It would reduce the amount of
work for all of Wayne Enterprises,

09:20.860 --> 09:22.760
including you.

09:22.762 --> 09:26.399
You're telling me that this
device can take over my job?

09:27.133 --> 09:29.833
Well, I mean, yes.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.435
If you wanted it to.

09:31.437 --> 09:33.537
Perfect. That's amazing.
Good job.

09:33.539 --> 09:35.940
With Brother Eye in charge,
I don't need to be.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.775
Now, if you'll excuse me.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.578
Oh, but what about the new legal
council that we're hiring for...

09:40.580 --> 09:42.915
Yeah,
whatever you think is best.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.117
Hmm.

09:47.119 --> 09:49.954
Alfred, bring the car around.
I need to get out of this building ASAP.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.355
ALFREIs there
an attack, sir?

09:51.357 --> 09:52.790
Shall I alert the others?

09:52.792 --> 09:55.426
The only attack
is on my sanity.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.194
I need to spend
less time in meetings

09:57.196 --> 09:58.929
and more time
out in the real world

09:58.931 --> 10:00.497
doing the important work.

10:00.499 --> 10:02.666
Master Bruce,
with all due respect,

10:02.668 --> 10:06.070
Wayne Enterprises
is your family's legacy.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.272
Bruce Wayne uses
the money it generates

10:08.274 --> 10:10.274
for a lot of
worthwhile causes.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.577
Alfred, the only
worthwhile cause is justice.

10:13.579 --> 10:15.212
If I have to sit through
another meeting

10:15.214 --> 10:17.214
about some stupid
computer program

10:17.216 --> 10:21.552
I'll have to change my name to
"Ripping My Hair Out By Its Roots Man."

10:21.554 --> 10:23.821
That's a bit
overdramatic...

10:23.823 --> 10:25.656
Even for you, Master Bruce.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.658
Is it, Alfred? Is it?

10:27.660 --> 10:29.460
I'm done being Bruce Wayne.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.729
He's a billionaire
waste of space.

10:31.731 --> 10:35.899
Always happy, with his perfect
smile and chiseled features.

10:35.901 --> 10:40.270
The envy of every man,
and loved by everyone around the world.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.906
Sounds dreadful, Master Bruce.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.508
It is.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.112
With this new Brother Eyeball
or whatever it's called,

10:48.114 --> 10:50.881
Wayne Enterprises
doesn't need me.

10:50.883 --> 10:53.083
In fact...

10:53.085 --> 10:55.019
Alfred, I want you
to sell the company.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.620
Sir!

10:58.791 --> 11:01.058
Firstly, might you reconsider?

11:01.060 --> 11:05.029
Secondly, that's not something
they taught us in butler school.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.398
Oh, I'm sure there's
a "how-to" video online.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.299
In the meantime,
put out a press release.

11:09.301 --> 11:12.638
- Now let's go home.
- Yes, Master Bruce.

11:20.713 --> 11:24.948
Two-Face, it's time
to implement Plan A.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.984
Wowsers,
it's dark in here.

11:26.986 --> 11:30.387
You should turn on a light
so you don't strain your eyes.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.757
Oh, here we go.
The lawyer's got something to say.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.092
Surprise!

11:35.094 --> 11:36.794
Don't mind goody two-shoes.

11:36.796 --> 11:39.930
How can you be sure
you can get them all alone?

11:39.932 --> 11:41.331
Ooh, good question.

11:41.333 --> 11:45.602
How? Because I know
how Batman thinks.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.272
I've heard
that before.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.274
Oh, I'm sure you have.

11:50.276 --> 11:54.244
Probably from all the other villains
you've teamed up with in the past.

11:54.246 --> 11:55.446
That's your problem.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.248
Always listening,
never doing.

11:58.250 --> 12:02.586
Do you know why you're always going
to be a B-list villain, Harvey?

12:02.588 --> 12:04.521
It's because
you haven't realized

12:04.523 --> 12:07.658
the most important rule
for being successful.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.661
Ooh, I wanna know.
What's that?

12:10.663 --> 12:13.163
Fortune favors the bold.

12:13.165 --> 12:15.701
Fortune favors the bold.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.774
Oh, hey!

12:23.776 --> 12:25.309
It's attorney Harvey Dent.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.010
Hey, Dent, what can you
tell us about the rumors

12:27.012 --> 12:30.547
of a mysterious Batman
prowling the streets at night?

12:30.549 --> 12:33.951
Oh, I can assure you,
there is no such...

12:45.731 --> 12:47.297
Look, it's Bruce Wayne.

12:48.801 --> 12:51.235
Hey, Bruce, over here.
Over here, Bruce.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.036
Mr. Wayne, over here.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.772
Hey, Harv,
nice to see you.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.039
- You're lookin' good, Bruce.
- I love your suit.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.441
Mister Wayne, a quote.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.209
What do you attribute
to all your success?

12:59.211 --> 13:02.146
Oh, it all boils down to something
my father used to tell me.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.047
Fortune favors the bold.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.352
Fortune favors
the bold.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.624
Now, run along, Harvey.
We've got work to do.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.593
Of all the...

13:16.595 --> 13:19.396
We do not deserve
to be treated like that.

13:19.398 --> 13:21.965
I agree, but I also think
he's right.

13:21.967 --> 13:26.003
No, I don't think we're B-list,
I mean, maybe an A-minus.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.938
No, you nincompoop!

13:27.940 --> 13:29.406
About what he said.

13:29.408 --> 13:32.776
What that billionaire bum
Bruce Wayne used to say.

13:32.778 --> 13:36.079
Oh, you promised we would
never talk about the "B" word.

13:36.081 --> 13:39.082
Oh, stop whining,
you big baby.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.185
Wayne isn't worth
the mental energy.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.520
His flashy smile,
his big house,

13:43.522 --> 13:47.457
you know, if I had that kind of money,
I would really do some good in this city.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.797
"Wayne Enterprises for sale."

13:53.799 --> 13:56.099
Would you look at that.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.368
You know, what if I told you

13:58.370 --> 14:02.139
there's a way that we could take
care of Batman and Bruce Wayne

14:02.141 --> 14:03.941
in one fell swoop?

14:03.943 --> 14:05.542
I'm listening.

14:05.544 --> 14:08.946
What if, instead of always
fighting against each other,

14:08.948 --> 14:12.082
we work together instead?

14:12.084 --> 14:13.984
Me and you, like a team op?

14:13.986 --> 14:17.888
Exactly. I think I know a way
that we can change Gotham,

14:17.890 --> 14:22.628
destroy Batman, and give Wayne
the punishment he deserves.

14:26.498 --> 14:28.398
Damian.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.834
Are you done with your
math homework?

14:30.836 --> 14:31.969
I just finished.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.604
- What about physics?
- Done.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.305
- Forensics? Escapology?
- Done. Done.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.074
And the three chapters on
Mediterranean mythology,

14:37.076 --> 14:38.976
and their relation to
socio-economic philosophy?

14:38.978 --> 14:40.477
Boring, but done.

14:40.479 --> 14:41.578
Hmm.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.614
What about your thesis
on buildology?

14:43.616 --> 14:47.050
Buildology? When am I ever going to have
to build anything in the real world?

14:47.052 --> 14:50.187
They've got master builders
for that sort of stuff.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.555
You'd be surprised.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.992
So, you've finished
everything?

14:54.994 --> 14:58.495
Great! What do you say to
two hours of patrol?

14:58.497 --> 14:59.930
Really? You mean it?

14:59.932 --> 15:01.798
Yes, but only two hours.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.068
After that, straight back and
work on your Esperanto, okay?

15:05.070 --> 15:09.006
Yes!

15:09.008 --> 15:12.878
Finally. I can't wait to get into
something a bit more comfortable.

15:29.728 --> 15:31.295
All right, Robin,

15:31.297 --> 15:34.631
time to strike fear into the
hearts of criminals everywhere.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.867
We're going somewhere else?

15:36.869 --> 15:39.169
No, I meant in Gotham.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.672
Well then,
why'd you say everywhere?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.377
I have a question.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.646
You have all these costumes
in these cases.

15:49.648 --> 15:52.849
I mean, that's Dick's,
Barbara's, Tim's,

15:52.851 --> 15:54.486
but whose is this?

15:55.087 --> 15:56.922
That's Jason's.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.059
Oh.

16:02.061 --> 16:05.028
I'm sorry. Is he, uh...

16:05.030 --> 16:06.465
Yes.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.469
- Impossible!
- What's wrong?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.506
Someone got in.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.076
Dead-end Alley, midnight.

16:19.078 --> 16:20.844
Sweet. A mystery.

16:20.846 --> 16:23.080
- I'll warm up the Batmobile...
- No!

16:23.082 --> 16:24.348
It's too dangerous.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.717
I can handle danger.
I love danger.

16:26.719 --> 16:30.053
In fact, I wanted to ask you
to change my name to

16:30.055 --> 16:31.321
"Danger Lad."

16:31.323 --> 16:34.157
Like, "Batman and Danger Lad."

16:34.159 --> 16:35.625
I mean, just yesterday,

16:35.627 --> 16:38.929
I used a fork to make
a tuna fish sandwich

16:38.931 --> 16:41.665
and a bowl of spaghetti.
Same fork.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.134
Cross-contamination
is nothing to laugh about.

16:44.136 --> 16:45.569
But it doesn't matter.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.404
Whoever left the note
left no fingerprints,

16:47.406 --> 16:51.041
and knew the Batcave security
system inside and out,

16:51.043 --> 16:53.577
including how to escape
the watchful eye

16:53.579 --> 16:57.347
of our formerly most-trusted
security protocol,

16:57.349 --> 16:58.882
- Ace.
- Hmm?

17:00.352 --> 17:01.952
No, I'll go alone.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.653
I want you to stay here

17:03.655 --> 17:06.825
and work with Ace
on his situational awareness.

17:29.848 --> 17:33.316
You'll need to work on your
sneaking skills, Nightwing.

17:33.318 --> 17:35.185
I heard you three blocks away.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.621
Oh, man, I thought I had you.

17:37.623 --> 17:38.755
Hey, where's Robin?

17:38.757 --> 17:41.625
At home, out of harm's way.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.861
Batman, Damian isn't Jason.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.463
Next subject.

17:46.465 --> 17:48.231
As the world's
greatest detective,

17:48.233 --> 17:50.734
I deduce that you're here because
you received the same note.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.969
- Right here.
- Me, too.

17:56.308 --> 17:58.108
Hey, Babs.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.676
Uh, Babs?

17:59.678 --> 18:01.945
Batman, could you kindly tell
your former Boy Wonder

18:01.947 --> 18:04.181
that I am no longer
speaking to him?

18:04.183 --> 18:06.116
- Ugh.
- Why?

18:06.118 --> 18:08.185
If he happens to ask why,

18:08.187 --> 18:11.955
explain to him that I texted
him, like, two hours ago

18:11.957 --> 18:15.292
and have not received so much
as one emoticon in return.

18:16.361 --> 18:18.395
I was just about to text back

18:18.397 --> 18:19.796
and then I got this note.

18:19.798 --> 18:22.165
Bat emergency
trumps texting back.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.601
- Check it out.
- It takes zero seconds to text an emoticon.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.070
Am I interrupting anything?

18:27.072 --> 18:28.572
Impressive.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.207
You could learn
from her, Nightwing.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.275
I couldn't hear her at all.

18:32.277 --> 18:36.748
So, the Bat family gets a note to meet
in an alley with one door at the end.

18:37.316 --> 18:38.684
Shall we?

18:45.924 --> 18:47.926
- Clear.
- Clear.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.693
Clear.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.795
Robin,

18:51.797 --> 18:54.364
I told you to stay
in the cave.

18:54.366 --> 18:58.902
No, what you said is help Ace
with his situational awareness.

18:58.904 --> 19:00.270
And I did.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.142
Bark!

19:05.611 --> 19:08.545
That's not what I meant
and you know it.

19:08.547 --> 19:11.650
It doesn't matter.
I mean, there's nothing here.

19:15.387 --> 19:16.688
It's a trap.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.860
Robin, stay behind me.

19:23.862 --> 19:26.563
- Robin.
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Let's do this.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.867
Kids. What are you
gonna do, huh?

19:55.427 --> 19:57.227
Nice moves, Batgirl.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.095
Robin, did you hear something?

19:59.097 --> 20:00.764
Maybe it was the wind.

20:00.766 --> 20:04.736
I know it wasn't Nightwing because
he's too busy to talk to me.

20:05.237 --> 20:07.304
Ooh, burn.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.572
Well, well, well,

20:42.574 --> 20:45.909
looks like the Bat family
got my invitations.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.644
It's been too long.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.145
Uh, do we know this guy?

20:49.147 --> 20:51.014
Oh, come on, Richard.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.416
You haven't figured
it out yet?

20:53.418 --> 20:55.385
You will.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.153
What about you, Babs?

20:57.155 --> 20:58.855
Katherine, Bruce?

20:58.857 --> 21:01.791
And you, the new Robin.

21:01.793 --> 21:03.593
Ridiculous.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.929
He knows our
secret identities.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.664
I don't like
the looks of this.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.968
Then you'll hate what's next.

21:10.569 --> 21:11.968
That's Gotham.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.738
Wow, we've got a real
Boy Wonder here.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.273
Yeah, it's Gotham.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.675
The city you're supposed
to protect.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.578
You'd think with Batman
fighting crime at night

21:21.580 --> 21:25.248
and Bruce Wayne using his
vast fortune during the day

21:25.250 --> 21:26.883
things would improve,

21:26.885 --> 21:28.652
but they really haven't.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.020
Have they?

21:30.022 --> 21:31.988
Agreed. That's why,
as of this morning,

21:31.990 --> 21:36.026
I've sold my company to
concentrate on crimefighting

21:36.028 --> 21:37.093
full-time.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.895
You what? What...

21:38.897 --> 21:41.798
Tell me that doesn't affect the trust
funds you've set up, right? Right?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.233
No matter.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.435
You've claimed stewardship
of Gotham.

21:45.437 --> 21:49.072
So I'll leave it up to the Dark
Knight to save its streets.

21:49.074 --> 21:53.610
I've planted five devastating
devices throughout the city.

21:53.612 --> 21:56.980
Four shown here
and one, well,

21:56.982 --> 21:59.416
let's keep that
a surprise, shall we?

21:59.418 --> 22:01.618
You have one hour
to find the four.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.854
If you stop them,
I'll give you the location of the fifth.

22:04.856 --> 22:06.956
If you don't, well,

22:06.958 --> 22:09.159
you are a detective.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.227
Red Hood, out.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.063
You sold your company?

22:13.065 --> 22:14.497
Since when? Why?

22:14.499 --> 22:16.833
If we could just go back
quickly to the trust fund thing.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.002
All right, family meeting.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.770
I have determined that
being Bruce Wayne

22:20.772 --> 22:22.706
cuts into valuable
crimefighting time.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.741
Case in point,

22:24.743 --> 22:27.811
if I was in another boring meeting,
would I have been here to save Gotham?

22:27.813 --> 22:29.145
- We could do it.
- I guess not.

22:29.147 --> 22:30.146
My trust fund.

22:30.148 --> 22:32.549
Whoever this mysterious
madman is,

22:32.551 --> 22:34.451
he's endangered
the entire city,

22:34.453 --> 22:38.722
and it's going to take Batman,
not Bruce Wayne, to make things right.

22:38.724 --> 22:42.892
I was able to download the coordinates
of these threats around town.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.627
Batwoman, you get
the police station.

22:44.629 --> 22:45.995
Batgirl, the fairgrounds.

22:45.997 --> 22:47.697
Nightwing,
take the train station,

22:47.699 --> 22:49.866
and I'll check out
the Monarch Theater.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.301
What about me?

22:51.303 --> 22:52.736
Studies show that kids
your age need between

22:52.738 --> 22:54.037
eight and twelve
hours of sleep,

22:54.039 --> 22:55.872
and that's what
you're going to do.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.173
You're kidding me.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.575
You can't change
the studies, Robin.

22:58.577 --> 22:59.743
The studies don't lie.

22:59.745 --> 23:01.544
I'm not going home. No way!

23:01.546 --> 23:02.645
- Yes way!
- No!

23:02.647 --> 23:04.080
- Yes!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:04.082 --> 23:07.417
Okay, everybody,
just cool your Batjets.

23:07.419 --> 23:08.718
Batman, a moment.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.487
Listen, Robin can go with me.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.122
I'll make sure he's safe.

23:12.124 --> 23:15.592
I'm not sure that this is
the best course of action.

23:15.594 --> 23:16.860
Well, I am.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.428
He's not Jason, Bruce,

23:18.430 --> 23:21.133
but if you keep pushing
him away, maybe he will be.

23:21.566 --> 23:22.665
Fine.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.200
But if anything happens...

23:24.202 --> 23:26.202
I know, I know, you'll make me
help Plastic Man

23:26.204 --> 23:28.371
when he gets stuck in his
taffy-puller again.

23:28.373 --> 23:30.106
All right, squirt,
you're with me.

23:30.108 --> 23:31.207
Sweet!

23:31.209 --> 23:32.909
- Remember your training.
- I will.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.213
- And listen to Nightwing.
- I will.

23:36.381 --> 23:38.250
And please
be careful.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.458
Make it quick, Alfred.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.294
I'm en route to stop evil,
and I really don't want to split my focus.

23:51.296 --> 23:52.562
Sir, good news.

23:52.564 --> 23:55.732
I've successfully sold
Wayne Enterprises.

23:55.734 --> 23:58.601
Those "how-to" videos
really did the trick.

23:58.603 --> 24:01.938
I'm watching one now
on how to open stuck jars

24:01.940 --> 24:03.206
and it's absolutely...

24:03.208 --> 24:04.707
That's fascinating, Alfred.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.244
Huh?

24:08.213 --> 24:11.080
My tires, they've been stolen!

24:11.082 --> 24:12.782
Oh, you're in luck, sir.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.685
I just saw a video on
how to claim tire theft

24:15.687 --> 24:18.188
on your insurance.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.859
Maybe those "how-to" videos
were a bad idea.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.764
Hey, Gotham PD.
Open up!

24:27.766 --> 24:29.999
You'll never get away
with this, Croc.

24:30.001 --> 24:31.801
Batman will stop you.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.670
Huh, Batman?

24:33.672 --> 24:35.271
He's nothin'.

24:35.273 --> 24:39.042
I'm stronger,
faster and smarter than he'll ever be.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.777
Don't worry, Commissioner,

24:40.779 --> 24:42.912
when he shows up
I'll prove to you

24:42.914 --> 24:45.114
who the best man really is.

24:45.116 --> 24:47.919
Then you're
going to be very disappointed.

24:48.854 --> 24:52.322
So, Batman decided
to send a girl

24:52.324 --> 24:54.491
to do a man's job.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.593
No, he wanted it done right,

24:56.595 --> 24:58.061
so he sent a woman.

24:58.063 --> 25:00.630
Pretty big talk.

25:04.402 --> 25:06.402
Ooh. Ooh!

25:06.404 --> 25:07.570
Ouch.

25:12.744 --> 25:14.045
Huh?

25:27.559 --> 25:29.125
Ow, ow!

25:29.127 --> 25:30.262
Ow!

25:32.264 --> 25:33.331
Huh?

25:36.968 --> 25:38.668
The bigger they are...

25:38.670 --> 25:40.438
Um, excuse me.

25:42.641 --> 25:43.740
On it.

25:49.247 --> 25:52.715
Batwoman here.
I've deactivated the device at GCPD.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.618
It was being guarded by Killer Croc.
So, be careful.

25:55.620 --> 25:59.422
There's no telling what other surprises
this Hood has in store for you guys.

25:59.424 --> 26:00.926
Look out!

26:11.937 --> 26:13.536
Huh?

26:15.707 --> 26:17.375
She's unstoppable.

26:48.707 --> 26:50.342
Nothin' is worth this.

26:58.183 --> 26:59.649
What?

26:59.651 --> 27:02.619
So, you're the new girl
on the Bat block, huh?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.389
Who are...

27:05.757 --> 27:07.959
Aw, too bad for you.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.745
Not creepy at all.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.184
A funhouse?

27:35.186 --> 27:38.556
What's fun about
a creepy clown? Ugh.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.007
Hmm.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.609
Feeling a little light-headed.

28:01.112 --> 28:02.712
I could use a snack.

28:02.714 --> 28:04.247
Me, too.

28:04.249 --> 28:05.948
What? Who are you?

28:05.950 --> 28:08.284
I'm you, but better.

28:10.121 --> 28:13.122
Maybe you should
text Nightwing.

28:13.124 --> 28:15.925
Oh, wait, he never responds,

28:15.927 --> 28:17.460
so why bother?

28:19.664 --> 28:23.833
I bet he texts
Starfire back right away.

28:23.835 --> 28:24.967
No.

28:36.948 --> 28:38.249
Huh?

28:39.951 --> 28:41.150
Scarecrow.

28:41.152 --> 28:43.586
Aw, scared, Batgirl?

28:43.588 --> 28:48.124
Sometimes mirrors can
cast a scary reflection.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.625
But don't worry,

28:49.627 --> 28:52.862
soon you won't be scared
of anything

28:52.864 --> 28:54.964
ever again.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.170
Keep it together, Babs.
This isn't real.

29:01.172 --> 29:03.306
It's just his scare toxin.

29:03.308 --> 29:05.410
I have to get
rid of it somehow.

29:13.551 --> 29:15.787
Is Batgirl
running away?

29:31.903 --> 29:33.202
Hey, Scarecrow,

29:33.204 --> 29:35.838
I'd like to introduce you
to a big fan.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.642
No!

29:40.111 --> 29:41.811
Clever, Batgirl.

29:41.813 --> 29:43.412
But even you can't stop me

29:43.414 --> 29:46.682
from finishing what
the Red Hood started.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.155
Whoa!

29:52.223 --> 29:54.425
So long, Batgirl.

30:16.181 --> 30:19.248
Too late, Batgirl.

30:19.250 --> 30:23.019
Now everyone
will fear the Scarecrow.

30:34.799 --> 30:35.865
What?

30:35.867 --> 30:36.935
No!

30:39.704 --> 30:41.337
Confetti?

30:41.339 --> 30:43.506
Save me!

30:43.508 --> 30:44.576
Oh.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.745
Cheese!

30:53.818 --> 30:56.621
Mommy.

31:00.491 --> 31:02.191
Not bad, Batgirl.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.526
Not bad at all.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.932
And to think, I used to have
a crush on you.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.975
Yeah.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.643
Mmm-hmm.
No, don't worry, honey.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.378
I'll be sure to
pick up the diapers.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.746
Citizen.

31:23.748 --> 31:25.984
I need to Bat-commandeer
your vehicle.

31:27.018 --> 31:28.651
Um, honey,

31:28.653 --> 31:30.119
I need to
call you back.

31:30.121 --> 31:32.388
I need your car in order
to save the city.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.956
Batman! Whoa!

31:33.958 --> 31:36.425
Fred Dundelinger.
Pleasure.

31:36.427 --> 31:37.927
You wanna use my car?

31:37.929 --> 31:40.832
- Oh, man.
- Yes, I know. It's quite an honor.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.032
Oh, gee.

31:43.034 --> 31:45.701
You know, if it was any other
day, I'd totally help out.

31:45.703 --> 31:48.304
But my wife needs
some saving of her own.

31:48.306 --> 31:49.574
Uh...

31:50.241 --> 31:52.108
Oh. I know.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.277
Um, okay, how 'bout this?

31:54.279 --> 31:55.945
I need to make
a quick stop at Westmart,

31:55.947 --> 31:58.047
and then I can drop you off
wherever you need to go.

31:59.117 --> 32:00.385
Fine.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.890
Wow!

32:06.958 --> 32:08.858
All right. Let's go.

32:10.061 --> 32:11.560
Aren't you
forgetting something?

32:11.562 --> 32:13.195
- Hmm?
- Seat belts.

32:13.197 --> 32:14.764
Hands at nine and three,

32:14.766 --> 32:16.799
and you might want
to check your rearview mirror.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.834
Okay. Well, sorry.
Thought you were in a hurry.

32:18.836 --> 32:21.170
You can't rush
car safety, citizen.

32:21.172 --> 32:22.838
Now, let's go.

32:25.910 --> 32:29.078
And then I told him I was
totally old enough to fight ninjas.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.513
But he was all,

32:30.515 --> 32:32.248
"Maybe when you're older."

32:32.250 --> 32:33.683
I mean, come on.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.285
Batman is just
so unreasonable.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.720
I know.

32:37.722 --> 32:39.488
I mean, I was gonna
text her back.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.023
You have to give
a guy a minute.

32:41.025 --> 32:43.492
You can't just keep sending
"thumbs-up" all the time.

32:43.494 --> 32:44.961
I wanted to do
something original,

32:44.963 --> 32:47.596
like a smiley-face
with a heart or something.

32:47.598 --> 32:48.998
I hadn't figured it out.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.268
Um, are we talking
about the same thing?

32:52.270 --> 32:53.636
Oh. Sorry.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.372
You said Batman,
not Batgirl.

32:56.374 --> 33:01.344
Listen, no one knows how unreasonable
Batman is better than me.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.346
Oh, he used to
make me so angry.

33:03.348 --> 33:05.147
What changed?

33:05.149 --> 33:08.250
One time, Two-Face had us trapped
over this pool of robotic sharks.

33:08.252 --> 33:10.588
It was either him or me.

33:11.889 --> 33:13.189
Well, what happened?

33:13.191 --> 33:14.290
What did Batman do?

33:14.292 --> 33:16.025
He didn't hesitate.

33:16.027 --> 33:18.394
He offered himself up to be
thrown in with the sharks.

33:18.396 --> 33:20.930
That's when I realized
he cares more for me,

33:20.932 --> 33:21.964
for you,

33:21.966 --> 33:24.633
than he'll ever care
for himself.

33:24.635 --> 33:26.402
Robin, the only reason
he's so hard on you

33:26.404 --> 33:28.070
is he wants you to be safe.

33:28.072 --> 33:29.338
I'm safe.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.676
I am Mr. Safe!

33:32.877 --> 33:34.310
"Mr. Safe," huh?

33:38.249 --> 33:40.649
Snow? At this time of year?

33:40.651 --> 33:43.054
Something fishy's going on.
That's for sure.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.756
Ow!

33:46.424 --> 33:47.692
Move!

33:52.897 --> 33:53.896
Riddle me this.

33:53.898 --> 33:56.866
What do you call
a bird in winter?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.367
A brrrd!

34:01.272 --> 34:02.972
Riddle me this.

34:02.974 --> 34:05.341
What do you call two criminals
who're about to go to prison?

34:05.343 --> 34:07.043
What?

34:07.045 --> 34:08.643
The... Uh...

34:08.646 --> 34:10.379
Uh, I... I got nothing.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.049
You're going to Blackgate.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.951
We're not caged
that easily, bird-boy.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.129
They don't look scary.

34:26.496 --> 34:28.632
You had to say
something, didn't you?

34:37.942 --> 34:41.210
Now, are you two
gonna come quietly or...

34:41.212 --> 34:42.545
Hey! Where'd they go?

34:42.547 --> 34:44.213
Bye-bye, Bat-babies.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.116
You're not getting away
that easily.

34:52.156 --> 34:53.524
Robin, wait!

34:54.225 --> 34:56.094
I'm in so much trouble.

35:07.238 --> 35:10.706
Faster, Penguin.
That little pest is gaining on us.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.577
This should
slow him down.

35:24.655 --> 35:26.624
I'm in so much trouble.

35:27.492 --> 35:28.759
Huh?

35:39.604 --> 35:41.403
I guess Batman was right.

35:41.405 --> 35:43.339
Buildology for the win.

35:43.341 --> 35:44.773
Penguin, my friend.

35:44.775 --> 35:46.675
What has full pockets,

35:46.677 --> 35:50.212
a private island, and no bats?

35:50.214 --> 35:51.280
Tell me, Riddler.

35:51.282 --> 35:54.049
After Red Hood's check clears,

35:54.051 --> 35:55.151
we do.

35:58.222 --> 35:59.490
Whoo-hoo!

36:18.943 --> 36:20.676
Huh?

36:27.518 --> 36:28.786
Huh?

36:31.355 --> 36:33.055
Like we said,

36:33.057 --> 36:34.723
going to Blackgate.

36:34.725 --> 36:37.228
Wow. I couldn't
do it better myself.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.298
Well, actually, yeah, I could.

36:44.335 --> 36:45.768
Pathetic.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.037
It seems he's not
training them like he used to.

36:49.974 --> 36:51.309
Ooh!

37:04.722 --> 37:07.723
And here I thought
this was gonna get boring.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.594
Long time no see.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.330
Huh?

37:24.775 --> 37:26.208
Come on, Nightwing.

37:26.210 --> 37:27.543
You can't win.

37:27.545 --> 37:29.311
I know all your moves.

37:29.313 --> 37:30.715
You think so?

37:40.891 --> 37:41.959
Huh?

37:46.364 --> 37:47.429
Still got it.

37:51.669 --> 37:54.071
Up for a little race,
circus boy?

38:05.750 --> 38:08.286
No, no, really.
The Batman.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.619
No, it's not an excuse.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.087
I promise. Oh, here he comes.

38:12.089 --> 38:14.390
Okay, I'll call you
back later. Love you. Bye.

38:14.392 --> 38:15.591
All right. Let's go.

38:15.593 --> 38:16.825
- You got the diapers?
- Check.

38:16.827 --> 38:18.160
- Comic book?
- Check.

38:18.162 --> 38:20.062
Autograph?

38:20.931 --> 38:23.532
"To my best buddy, Fred."

38:23.534 --> 38:28.039
That's F-R-E-D.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.106
Okay, let's go.

38:31.108 --> 38:33.208
Okay. Ooh, what about
the ice cream?

38:34.412 --> 38:36.045
I'll be right back.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.749
Batman
forgot the ice cream.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.336
So, he knows
some shortcuts, eh?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.872
Well, so do I.

39:22.293 --> 39:24.061
Not bad, old man.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.740
And then there was one.

39:43.180 --> 39:46.014
Good work, kind citizen.
Your city thanks you.

39:46.016 --> 39:47.916
No problem, Mr. Batman.

39:47.918 --> 39:49.987
Good luck with whatever
you're doing.

39:50.988 --> 39:52.721
Uh, hey, quick question.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.957
Sorry. Um, what was
with your badge?

39:54.959 --> 39:57.860
Like, why does Batman
have a badge?

39:57.862 --> 40:01.029
So people know I'm Batman.

40:01.031 --> 40:04.466
But you are dressed
like Batman.

40:04.468 --> 40:07.471
It's pretty clear
that you're Batman.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.207
I got to go.

40:10.841 --> 40:12.674
Okay, all right.

40:18.749 --> 40:23.085
Oh, hi. I'm Billy Batson
with WHIZ.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.155
- I'm Batman.
- Oh, man, the Batman.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.756
If I land
an interview with you,

40:27.758 --> 40:29.691
I'm sure I can get some
money for the orphanage.

40:29.693 --> 40:31.360
- The orphanage?
- Yeah.

40:31.362 --> 40:34.329
Um, the orphanage I live in
is having some hard times.

40:34.331 --> 40:36.398
I guess Bruce Wayne
decided to sell his company

40:36.400 --> 40:38.834
and whoever bought it
doesn't want to help out.

40:38.836 --> 40:40.536
Who bought the company?

40:40.538 --> 40:42.404
I don't know.

40:42.406 --> 40:44.740
It's too bad Mr. Wayne doesn't
know how much he means to Gotham,

40:44.742 --> 40:46.408
or he'd never have sold.

40:46.410 --> 40:48.710
Now there are a bunch of kids
that need help with clothes,

40:48.712 --> 40:50.646
food, you know.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.314
It's why I'm doing
my podcast.

40:52.316 --> 40:54.583
If I can get a good story,
maybe I can sell it

40:54.585 --> 40:56.985
to make some extra cash
for the other orphans.

40:56.987 --> 41:00.422
That's very unselfish, Billy.

41:00.424 --> 41:01.924
I will make this right.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.926
But for now,
I need you to leave.

41:03.928 --> 41:05.529
Why?

41:07.731 --> 41:11.733
Look who
turned up for the show.

41:11.735 --> 41:14.670
Harvey, you don't
have to do this.

41:14.672 --> 41:16.705
He's right. I don't.

41:16.707 --> 41:18.440
Team up, remember?

41:18.442 --> 41:20.509
Oh, yeah.

41:20.511 --> 41:22.911
Sorry, Batman, I guess I do.

41:22.913 --> 41:24.813
Especially after today.

41:24.815 --> 41:29.051
We just closed a deal that's
going to change Gotham forever.

41:29.053 --> 41:31.987
Harvey, disable the device
and let's talk.

41:31.989 --> 41:35.190
Listen, I'll always
give you a chance, Batboy.

41:35.192 --> 41:38.894
Heads, I'll disarm this
and walk away.

41:38.896 --> 41:43.868
Tails...
Well, you figure it out.

41:48.772 --> 41:50.105
Aw, shucks.

41:50.107 --> 41:52.808
Better luck next time, Bats.

41:52.810 --> 41:55.911
Now, sit back,
grab some popcorn,

41:55.913 --> 41:58.914
and enjoy the show.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.990
Who needs to wait until
midnight for the party to begin?

42:07.992 --> 42:10.561
Let's start dancing right now!

42:12.229 --> 42:15.097
Billy, I'll distract him.
You get out through the door.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.798
But what about
that device thingy?

42:16.800 --> 42:19.203
I'll take care of it. Now, go.

42:31.181 --> 42:33.884
Always have to do the right
thing, don't you, Billy?

42:35.252 --> 42:37.553
Stop this insanity, Harvey.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.222
He doesn't know
about our other plan.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.690
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

42:41.692 --> 42:44.993
Quiet! It's only over
when I say it is, Bats.

42:44.995 --> 42:47.197
Oh, man.

43:10.387 --> 43:11.653
Oh, no!

43:11.655 --> 43:13.457
Which one? Which one?

43:18.596 --> 43:21.432
The red wire, Billy.

43:35.980 --> 43:38.015
Ha! You missed me!

43:39.483 --> 43:40.517
Huh?

43:44.121 --> 43:46.622
Show's over, Two-Face.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.290
Where is the Red Hood?

43:48.292 --> 43:51.059
Sorry. That's
attorney-client privilege.

43:51.061 --> 43:53.195
You're not getting
nothing from me.

43:53.197 --> 43:56.698
He said he had your family.
He said this was all part of his plan.

43:56.700 --> 43:58.400
You snitch!

43:58.402 --> 44:01.972
Nightwing, Batwoman,
can anyone read me?

44:02.773 --> 44:04.806
Robin?

44:04.808 --> 44:08.377
Hey, so looks like you
made it to all my traps in time,

44:08.379 --> 44:10.612
just like I knew you would.

44:10.614 --> 44:14.750
Of course, that was the idea.
You guys are much easier to pick off apart

44:14.752 --> 44:16.118
than together.

44:16.120 --> 44:17.552
Let them go!

44:17.554 --> 44:21.392
How about we talk about it
at home?

44:22.660 --> 44:24.893
Um, Mr. Batman?

44:24.895 --> 44:26.664
Where did Two-Face go?

44:36.540 --> 44:38.774
Mark my words.

44:38.776 --> 44:40.475
Someday, I'm gonna beat you.

44:40.477 --> 44:42.611
That's pretty much
what's gonna happen to you

44:42.613 --> 44:44.246
when Batman gets here.

44:44.248 --> 44:46.848
You think so,
do you, Small Fry?

44:46.850 --> 44:48.150
Leave him alone!

44:48.152 --> 44:50.686
I was a true believer
like you once.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.691
Never thought Batman
could do anything wrong.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.091
But you know what?

44:56.093 --> 44:58.827
He's just as human
as you and me.

44:58.829 --> 45:00.395
He likes to talk a good game,

45:00.397 --> 45:02.864
but Bruce is so busy
with his mission

45:02.866 --> 45:05.867
that he's forgotten to care
for those around him.

45:05.869 --> 45:09.771
Heck, he just told Alfred
to close his family business,

45:09.773 --> 45:13.141
with no thought as to what
that would mean for the city.

45:13.143 --> 45:15.977
I'm sure Master Bruce
has his reasons.

45:15.979 --> 45:18.048
He always does.

45:19.683 --> 45:21.185
Daddy's home.

45:26.190 --> 45:29.925
Great dismount.
I give you 9.5.

45:29.927 --> 45:32.094
Deduction for the
superhero landing.

45:32.096 --> 45:34.329
It's so last year.

45:34.331 --> 45:36.932
It's time to end this,
Red Hood,

45:36.934 --> 45:40.836
or should I say Jason Todd?

45:45.442 --> 45:49.044
The second Robin?
I thought you were dead.

45:49.046 --> 45:50.679
You said I was dead?

45:50.681 --> 45:53.014
No. Why would you
think that, Robin?

45:53.016 --> 45:54.616
I don't know.

45:54.618 --> 45:57.085
The way you always avoided
talking about him.

45:57.087 --> 45:58.954
He wishes I was dead.

45:58.956 --> 46:00.655
I'll give you this,

46:00.657 --> 46:03.325
you really are the world's
greatest detective.

46:03.327 --> 46:05.026
What gave it away?

46:05.028 --> 46:08.196
I began to suspect when you
were relaying personal details

46:08.198 --> 46:10.398
of everyone's secret identity.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.901
The train station,
where I met Damian's mother, Talia.

46:12.903 --> 46:15.537
The police station,
where Batgirl's father works.

46:15.539 --> 46:17.606
The fairgrounds,
where I first met Dick.

46:17.608 --> 46:21.276
And, finally, the alleyway where
I met you for the first time,

46:21.278 --> 46:23.779
when you stole the wheels
off the Batmobile.

46:23.781 --> 46:27.282
You stole the wheels
off the Batmobile?

46:27.284 --> 46:29.451
Oh, dude, that is so cool!

46:29.453 --> 46:31.520
Yeah. He was not happy.

46:31.522 --> 46:34.289
Oh, I'm guessing
he gave you that lecture

46:34.291 --> 46:37.859
on how you have to
"earn your own way in this world."

46:37.861 --> 46:39.427
Well, you do.

46:39.429 --> 46:42.030
Never mind he inherited,
like, five billion dollars.

46:42.032 --> 46:46.134
Right? And he still makes me
do chores around the house

46:46.136 --> 46:47.335
for an allowance of...

46:47.337 --> 46:49.271
Five bucks a week.

46:52.442 --> 46:55.744
Jason, how could you?
We were family.

46:55.746 --> 46:57.746
"Were" being
the operative word.

46:57.748 --> 47:00.148
After old man Bruce
kicked me out,

47:00.150 --> 47:02.083
I had no family.

47:02.085 --> 47:04.286
You didn't even call or write.

47:04.288 --> 47:06.421
Because you told me not to.

47:06.423 --> 47:10.258
If you recall,
I didn't kick you out, you left.

47:10.260 --> 47:12.194
- Liar.
- Batcomputer, playback.

47:12.196 --> 47:15.063
Security feed, J.T., 2009.

47:15.065 --> 47:17.999
Jason, there's a
robbery downtown. I'm headed there now.

47:18.001 --> 47:19.901
Cool. Let me know how it goes.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.905
Jason,
the Joker has escaped Arkham.

47:23.907 --> 47:27.242
Again? Sheesh!
Maybe they should up their security.

47:29.146 --> 47:31.413
Jason,
Mister Freeze is attacking City Hall.

47:31.415 --> 47:33.648
One sec. I've almost
beaten this thing.

47:36.687 --> 47:40.457
What? Wait! No!
No, no, no. No, no, no.

47:41.758 --> 47:43.325
Well, now that you
have the time,

47:43.327 --> 47:45.060
how about you come
help me save the city?

47:45.062 --> 47:48.129
I can't believe you!
I was so close!

47:48.131 --> 47:51.199
It took me forever to get to the
end, and you just pulled the plug.

47:51.201 --> 47:52.567
You never let me do anything!

47:52.569 --> 47:54.502
You need to get out,
see the world.

47:54.504 --> 47:57.038
You want me
to see the world? Fine!

47:57.040 --> 47:59.841
I'm sick of your Bat-rules
and your Bat-curfew.

47:59.843 --> 48:02.644
I'm out of here!
I'm gone! I mean it!

48:02.646 --> 48:04.846
There's nothing you can say
to stop me.

48:04.848 --> 48:06.448
I'm getting on my bike.

48:06.450 --> 48:09.284
I'm just gonna
drive out of here.

48:09.286 --> 48:10.787
By myself.

48:12.155 --> 48:13.889
Fine. I'm gone.

48:15.893 --> 48:19.930
See? If you cared,
you would have stopped me, followed me.

48:23.533 --> 48:27.035
Computer,
task Satellite One to track Jason Todd.

48:27.037 --> 48:28.236
Weekly updates.

48:28.238 --> 48:31.275
No, daily updates to my phone.

48:34.912 --> 48:39.314
You tasked an entire satellite
to follow me wherever I went?

48:39.316 --> 48:41.549
I knew that you needed
to leave the cave,

48:41.551 --> 48:44.819
step out into the world,
define your destiny.

48:44.821 --> 48:47.656
I did my best to track you
on all your adventures,

48:47.658 --> 48:50.260
but I lost you
somewhere over Tunisia.

49:00.337 --> 49:02.237
- Oh, dear.
- That's all well and good.

49:02.239 --> 49:05.373
But there's still one last device
out there, and it's about to go off.

49:05.375 --> 49:06.775
Oh, don't worry about it.

49:06.777 --> 49:08.643
Those devices
weren't actually dangerous.

49:08.645 --> 49:11.413
- In fact, they were filled with...
- Confetti.

49:11.415 --> 49:13.949
Bingo. I just wanted
to get your attention.

49:13.951 --> 49:16.386
Besides, Gotham is my city...

49:17.888 --> 49:21.623
- No!
- Computer, track the source of that explosion.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.658
Brother Eye One.

49:23.660 --> 49:26.394
That's the same satellite
I used to track Jason.

49:26.396 --> 49:29.597
I knew it!
He's betrayed us again!

49:29.599 --> 49:31.967
I swear, it wasn't me,
it was...

49:31.969 --> 49:33.704
Brother Eye.

49:36.473 --> 49:39.074
Uh, what's a "Brother Eye"?

49:39.076 --> 49:42.811
It's an automated AI authorized to
take control of Wayne Enterprises'

49:42.813 --> 49:45.246
various holdings just before
the company was sold.

49:45.248 --> 49:49.184
Uh, haven't we all seen sci-fi films?
That's a horrible idea.

49:49.186 --> 49:50.618
And who bought the company?

49:50.620 --> 49:53.757
I thought you'd
never ask.

49:54.424 --> 49:55.857
Two-Face.

49:55.859 --> 49:58.960
- But you work for me.
- Used to work for you.

49:58.962 --> 50:02.664
- Harvey, what are you doing?
- What am I doing?

50:02.666 --> 50:04.933
We're teaming up, remember?

50:04.935 --> 50:08.003
You see, the Hood over there reminded
us that we're never gonna be anything

50:08.005 --> 50:10.138
other than
a second-rate villain.

50:10.140 --> 50:13.641
I needed to be bolder.
As you know, fortune favors the bold,

50:13.643 --> 50:15.710
so I bought Wayne Enterprises.

50:15.712 --> 50:18.279
There's no way you could
buy Wayne Enterprises.

50:18.281 --> 50:21.750
Not on my salary, no,
but after I found this really cool

50:21.752 --> 50:24.119
"how-to" video on setting up
dummy corporations,

50:24.121 --> 50:27.255
all I needed to finalize
the deal was a lawyer.

50:27.257 --> 50:28.923
Me.

50:28.925 --> 50:31.159
Those "how-to" videos really
are quite informative.

50:31.161 --> 50:34.362
Ooh, did you watch the one
on how to open stuck jars?

50:34.364 --> 50:36.431
Changed my life.

50:36.433 --> 50:39.669
Mine too!
Are you two done yapping?

50:41.705 --> 50:43.638
And now that I'm in charge
of Wayne Enterprises,

50:43.640 --> 50:48.510
I can use Brother Eye to
take over all of Gotham City.

50:48.512 --> 50:50.078
Brother Eye.

50:50.080 --> 50:51.446
If you please.

50:51.448 --> 50:53.782
Initializing
Gotham shutdown.

51:12.035 --> 51:13.635
Oh, but wait,

51:13.637 --> 51:15.505
there's more.

51:17.307 --> 51:20.544
Brother Eye's OMAC drones.

51:21.244 --> 51:23.413
Aren't they neato?

51:44.301 --> 51:47.735
I may have two faces,
but I've got only goal.

51:47.737 --> 51:50.805
Proving I'm the best
villain in the world.

51:50.807 --> 51:52.373
What about you, Harvey?

51:52.375 --> 51:53.741
This isn't like you.

51:53.743 --> 51:55.376
I just want what
I've always wanted.

51:55.378 --> 51:59.547
Truth, justice and
destruction of Batman.

52:01.251 --> 52:06.087
Oh, yeah, the destruction
of Batman and Bruce Wayne.

52:06.089 --> 52:07.889
Bruce Wayne?

52:07.891 --> 52:09.991
What did Wayne
ever do to you?

52:09.993 --> 52:12.627
What did he ever do
for any of us?

52:12.629 --> 52:15.096
He's a narcissistic jerk
who has no regard

52:15.098 --> 52:18.433
for his family's legacy or his
own responsibility to Gotham.

52:18.435 --> 52:21.069
Wayne owns half the city
but it's a trash heap

52:21.071 --> 52:23.071
because he doesn't
pay any attention to it.

52:23.073 --> 52:25.440
He neglects the things
he's supposed to love.

52:25.442 --> 52:27.509
This is what I'm saying.

52:27.511 --> 52:32.480
Yeah, so we want Batman and Bruce
Wayne to come to Wayne Enterprises,

52:32.482 --> 52:33.715
tonight.

52:33.717 --> 52:35.950
Or I'll tear this city apart,

52:35.952 --> 52:38.221
brick by brick.

52:39.623 --> 52:41.322
What's the plan, Batman?

52:41.324 --> 52:44.325
- The plan is that you'll...
- Don't say I'm gonna stay here,

52:44.327 --> 52:45.660
because I'm not going to.

52:45.662 --> 52:47.562
You've trained me
to be the best,

52:47.564 --> 52:51.666
and how can I fight crime if you
don't let me, you know, fight crime?

52:51.668 --> 52:53.234
I was going to say,

52:53.236 --> 52:55.203
"You and the others
will head into the city

52:55.205 --> 52:57.839
"and keep the civilians
out of harm's way."

52:57.841 --> 52:59.407
Oh, heh.

52:59.409 --> 53:00.909
Yeah, and what about you?

53:00.911 --> 53:03.244
Simple, I have to break
into Wayne Enterprises,

53:03.246 --> 53:05.046
circumvent the world's
best security system

53:05.048 --> 53:07.215
and shut down Brother Eye
all while convincing

53:07.217 --> 53:10.652
Two-Face and Harvey Bruce and
Batman are two separate people.

53:10.654 --> 53:13.087
- I could help.
- No, you've done enough.

53:13.089 --> 53:14.622
Now, to your vehicles.

53:14.624 --> 53:16.626
We've got a city to save.

53:39.482 --> 53:41.049
There are hundreds
of those OMACs.

53:41.051 --> 53:42.817
There's no way
we can stop them.

53:42.819 --> 53:45.855
Don't freak out, Robin.
We got this.

54:00.270 --> 54:01.938
Ha! Too easy.

54:08.144 --> 54:09.711
Huh?

54:09.713 --> 54:11.915
How about I break
up this party?

54:12.515 --> 54:13.817
Permanently.

54:19.422 --> 54:22.626
I'm en route, I'll deploy
my net and...

54:23.693 --> 54:26.594
Get off of my jet!

54:35.272 --> 54:37.739
Uh-oh.

54:45.215 --> 54:46.616
Need a little help?

54:55.058 --> 54:56.224
Nice work, Robin.

54:56.226 --> 54:59.162
All right, time to go
OMAC hunting.

55:22.919 --> 55:25.655
I hope Batman is having
as much luck as we are.

55:41.137 --> 55:42.937
I never thought that
these secret doors

55:42.939 --> 55:45.073
I had built to do
escape work as Bruce Wayne

55:45.075 --> 55:46.874
would be used to break in.

55:46.876 --> 55:48.776
Ho-ho, irony.

55:48.778 --> 55:50.313
You are hilarious.

56:21.344 --> 56:23.911
As I surmised,

56:23.913 --> 56:26.247
only one of you
has made it.

56:26.249 --> 56:29.784
Too bad, I guess
that means goodbye, Gotham.

56:29.786 --> 56:32.320
I don't know what you're
talking about, Harvey.

56:32.322 --> 56:33.888
Bruce is right here.

56:33.890 --> 56:36.793
Oh, really?
I don't see him.

56:38.495 --> 56:40.561
Harvey, you have
to stop this.

56:40.563 --> 56:44.532
Stop this? You should've
stopped being so irresponsible.

56:44.534 --> 56:46.267
Me?

56:46.269 --> 56:49.103
He has a point,
you could be working harder for Gotham.

56:49.105 --> 56:51.506
- Exactly.
- Oh, you're one to talk.

56:51.508 --> 56:55.243
All you do is fight crime with
all those fancy gadgets of yours.

56:55.245 --> 56:57.078
I employ people.

56:57.080 --> 57:00.114
- I give them security.
- Security?

57:00.116 --> 57:02.350
Then why did you leave
your company?

57:02.352 --> 57:05.319
Oh, this is getting good.

57:05.321 --> 57:07.221
- Mmm.
- I needed a change.

57:07.223 --> 57:09.724
In retrospect,
maybe that wasn't the best decision.

57:09.726 --> 57:12.860
Hey, hey, why do you keep
moving behind that pillar, huh?

57:12.862 --> 57:15.329
What kind of game
are you playing, Batman?

57:15.331 --> 57:18.666
You're the one playing
games, Two-Face.

57:18.668 --> 57:20.568
And I'm through losing.

57:40.690 --> 57:43.224
At this rate, we'll be wrapped
up before Alfred's bedtime,

57:43.226 --> 57:45.493
which is astonishingly
early.

57:45.495 --> 57:46.796
Huh?

57:51.901 --> 57:53.801
Heads up, guys.

57:53.803 --> 57:56.671
And by heads up,
I mean, look up.

57:56.673 --> 57:59.843
There's some sort of nasty
laser coming from the sky.

58:24.834 --> 58:28.536
I thought you said we were
wrapped up with these OMACs.

58:28.538 --> 58:30.404
This isn't my fault.

58:30.406 --> 58:31.639
I don't think.

58:31.641 --> 58:33.708
It's always someone
else's fault, isn't it?

58:33.710 --> 58:37.211
We're not talking about
the OMACs anymore, are we?

58:38.214 --> 58:40.615
- No.
- Yeah, didn't think so.

58:53.530 --> 58:54.996
Something fishy's
going on.

58:54.998 --> 58:56.664
I only see Batman.

58:56.666 --> 58:58.199
Where's Wayne?

58:58.201 --> 59:00.301
You have till the count
of three to show us Wayne.

59:00.303 --> 59:04.171
Or else we let Brother Eye take
out the whole city at once.

59:04.173 --> 59:06.207
- One...
- Listen,

59:06.209 --> 59:08.509
Wayne isn't used
to being up this early.

59:08.511 --> 59:10.111
You know billionaires,

59:10.113 --> 59:12.348
sleep all day,
party all night.

59:12.916 --> 59:14.315
Two...

59:14.317 --> 59:16.452
I'm here. Just taking a nap.

59:17.287 --> 59:18.586
Hmm.

59:18.588 --> 59:20.621
These billionaires.
So lazy.

59:20.623 --> 59:23.024
Come on, Bruce, buck up.
This will all be over soon.

59:27.397 --> 59:29.764
Okay, I buy it.

59:29.766 --> 59:33.834
Now the question remains,
who has a better chance of talking sense

59:33.836 --> 59:34.936
into Two-Face?

59:34.938 --> 59:36.437
Bruce Wayne,

59:36.439 --> 59:37.907
or Batman?

59:44.013 --> 59:45.682
Don't shoot.

59:47.250 --> 59:49.884
Oh, Harvey, buddy.
Good to see you.

59:49.886 --> 59:52.453
I am not your buddy,
Bruce.

59:52.455 --> 59:54.422
Where's Batman?

59:54.424 --> 59:55.923
He, uh...

59:55.925 --> 59:58.593
He was worried about the
elevator safety certificate.

59:58.595 --> 01:00:01.195
As the new owner of this
building, you should know

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:02.964
it hasn't been inspected
in some time.

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:04.599
Oh, nobody cares
about that.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.368
Batman, if you don't
get out here right now,

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.940
you can say goodbye to Gotham's
most eligible bachelor.

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:13.242
Freeze, Two-Face.

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.046
- Batman?
- Batman?

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:22.516
I mean, yes, Batman is here.

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.452
Yes, the Dark Knight.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:28.055
The creature who strikes fear
in the hearts of criminals.

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:29.991
The world's greatest
detective,

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:33.928
listen to my gruff voice
and be intimidated.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.197
Are you okay, Batman?

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:38.165
Sounds like you might
have a cold.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:40.034
I always sound like this.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.369
Right, Two-Face?

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:44.071
Yes, I'd recognize
that voice anywhere.

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:45.406
It's unmistakable.

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:47.742
He really doesn't usually
sound like that.

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.010
See? No.

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:51.112
Harvey, come on, let's talk.

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:52.813
Why are you doing this?

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:54.382
Really?

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:57.118
Because I still believe in
bringing order to chaos.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.454
Gotham will be a better city
with Harvey Dent running things.

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:03.257
And I'll be the top
villain in this town

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:04.825
full of costumed creeps.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.962
With the help of Brother
Eye, we both come out on top.

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:10.400
Show them, Brother Eye.

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:17.938
Brother Eye does so much more than
making the trains run on time.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.607
It can use all
the technology

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:22.943
at Wayne Enterprises'
disposal to fix Gotham City.

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:25.546
Once and for all.

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:27.148
This is my fault, Bruce.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.616
Why are you still
talking to me like Batman?

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:29.684
But I can fix it!

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.087
No!

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.490
It's too late, Bruce.

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:38.025
Batman is gone.

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:40.528
The Bat family
is about to be destroyed

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.264
and Brother Eye is going
to instill the order

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:45.800
that Gotham
so desperately needs.

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:52.273
Whoo-hoo! Bat family
has got this.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.575
Don't get
too excited, Robin.

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:55.745
Look.

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.757
What are we gonna do?

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:12.526
Without our vehicles, we don't
stand a chance against those OMACs.

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:15.362
They move like one
unstoppable force.

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.764
We could always run.

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.432
Is that your solution
to everything?

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:20.601
I was going
to text you back.

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:23.571
I've seen you do a
double-flip over two villains

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:27.975
all while eating a sandwich and
you can't send me an emoticon?

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:30.978
- Guys...
- An emoticon couldn't explain all that you mean to me.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.747
Emoticons can
explain everything!

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:33.981
Guys!

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.816
Uh, Robin, what are you doing?

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:38.719
It's simple, really.
Batwoman gave me the idea.

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:40.354
- I did?
- Yeah.

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:42.923
Without our vehicles,
we don't stand a chance

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.492
against those OMACs.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:47.128
They're designed as separate
units that work as one,

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.431
which means...

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:55.436
If we combine our vehicles
into two giant vehicles,

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:58.305
maybe we can level
the playing field.

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.007
Buildology 101.

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:02.143
Clever.

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:06.914
So, we're gonna make
a big ship

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.484
by using...

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.460
Whoa!

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:22.129
This place looks like
Darkseid's walk-in closet.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:24.365
Intruder,
intruder.

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:29.603
Voice analysis of intruder reveals
insufficient gravel in your speech.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:33.142
Therefore, you are
not the real Batman.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.344
Took you that long, huh?

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.445
Now this is more like it.

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.548
That cowl was way
too restricting.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:43.083
So, listen, I'm gonna need
you to shut down

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:45.986
your operating system and
stop this OMAC factory

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.621
you got here.

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:49.423
I'm afraid
I can't do that, Red Hood.

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:52.059
Gotham needs to be fixed.

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:54.528
Fixed? Great, I mean,
I agree.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.764
A new coat of paint,
maybe a couple of coffee shops.

01:03:56.766 --> 01:04:00.167
Negative.
Gotham is a hub for criminality

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.669
and injustice.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.872
Therefore, it must be
completely dismantled.

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:06.140
Dismantled?

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:07.510
What are you talking
about?

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:14.448
Only when
the city is destroyed

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.417
can it be rebuilt anew.

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:19.854
Better without human
fallibility.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:24.191
You think the best way to fix Gotham
is to destroy everything in it?

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:25.795
Correct.

01:04:28.464 --> 01:04:30.600
Yeah, not gonna happen.

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:44.680
This is just like
my favorite video game.

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:06.769
And now, the final boss.

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:11.005
Come out, come out, Bruce.

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:12.708
I know you're
under there.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.619
Harvey, can't
we talk about this?

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:29.089
I'm through talking.
I... Both of us are.

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.639
Sorry, total accident.

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.683
Hold on, Harvey,
I've got you.

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:58.319
You'd save me?

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:00.321
Even though
I want the city destroyed?

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.723
We all deserve
a second chance.

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:04.091
Even you, Harvey.

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:06.327
Oh, that's so sweet.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.330
I just threw up
in my mouth.

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:11.098
Ugh. He's not kidding.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.366
But...

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.204
That was cold,
even for you, Harvey.

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:19.308
I learn from
the best.

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:33.956
Now, to get into
something more appropriate.

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.061
I can only hope the others
are holding up okay.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.840
All right, Robin,
you do the honors.

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:55.478
Get ready for
the Bat family.

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:02.983
Way to go, squirt.

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:04.487
Our turn, Batgirl.

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:20.036
Nightwing, are you
all right?

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:25.305
So, all I have to do
is get hit by a giant laser

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:26.940
to get you
to talk to me again, huh?

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:30.778
It's the satellite.
Until that thing is shut down,

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.915
we're never going to be
able to stop those OMACs.

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:39.353
Query,
satellite records indicate you fled

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:41.057
from Batman's employ.

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:46.860
Your anger towards Gotham
is cataloged.

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:50.531
Why do you resist?

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:52.266
Because Batman
was right.

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:54.668
Life isn't about sitting
down and doing nothing.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.970
It's about getting out
there and helping others.

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:59.073
Helping your city,
your friends.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.476
Your family.

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.787
My blaster!

01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:17.526
Well, looks like
I'll have to improvise.

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:23.630
Please, don't.

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.466
I would not advise that.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.943
External connection severed.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.232
Batman must've done it.
They've all shut down.

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.533
What about the satellite?

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.435
- Uh-oh.
- What "uh-oh"?

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:03.002
I do not like "uh-ohs."

01:09:03.005 --> 01:09:05.404
The satellite.
With its power gone,

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:07.140
it's being pulled
towards Earth.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.375
- So?
- So,

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:09.810
according to
my physics homework,

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.813
it'll reach terminal
velocity before impact.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:15.249
And a satellite
of that size means...

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.752
My insensitive boyfriend,
everyone.

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:23.557
We have to stop it.
Robin, can we move to an intercept course?

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:25.024
Yeah, I think so.

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:26.426
Do it.

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:28.261
Is that wise?
I mean, won't the impact destroy

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:29.429
anything in its path?

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:30.631
Yes.

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:33.903
Batwoman,
you are so hardcore.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.573
Yeah.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.743
I did it!

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:46.113
I finally beat the final boss.

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:51.618
The Hood?
What happened to Batman?

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.421
Not that it matters now.
You've ruined everything!

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:58.759
I'm going to have to end you
like I ended Bruce Wayne.

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.761
Almost ended Bruce Wayne.

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:05.532
He's safe and currently unwinding at
a hot rock and aromatherapy session.

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.468
He was so upset,
he booked 60 minutes.

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:13.075
Which is 59 minutes and 58 seconds
more than you have, Two-Face.

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.847
This is gonna hurt.

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:23.984
Is it over?

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:26.520
Rule 446, when dealing
with an advanced AI,

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:29.389
- you always...
- Back-up power restored.

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:31.592
Secondary protocol engaged.

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:35.195
- Secondary protocol?
- Brother Eye, what is the secondary protocol?

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:41.401
Brother Eye will supercharge the nuclear
energy facility in Wayne Enterprises

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.036
until it explodes.

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:45.706
You have a nuclear
reactor in the building?

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:48.175
It's safe and clean energy,
chum.

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:51.545
I looked up "chum" by the way.
It means fish cut up into shark bait.

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:53.580
Brother Eye, shut it down.

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:55.549
Unauthorized command.

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.384
Unauthorized?
What does that mean?

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:58.719
Who's authorized?

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:01.154
The CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:03.325
He's the CEO
of Wayne Enterprises.

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:07.661
I'm here.
Just taking a nap.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:09.930
These billionaires.
So lazy.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.199
Come on, Bruce, buck up.
This will all be over soon.

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:16.303
Likelihood
Batman is Bruce Wayne, 1%.

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:19.775
Oh, man, could this night
get any weirder?

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.084
- Now!
- Almost.

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:35.956
Five, four, three, two, one...

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.159
Eject!

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:49.169
Best job ever!

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:50.339
Whoo-hoo!

01:11:57.846 --> 01:12:01.315
Brother Eye, I'm sorry
I fooled you.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:07.387
The truth is, Brother Eye,
I'm Bruce Wayne.

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:11.992
Query,
why does Bruce Wayne hate his company?

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:15.962
Why does Bruce Wayne
hate me?

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:18.999
I don't hate you,
Brother Eye.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:22.569
Alfred, the only worthwhile
cause is justice.

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:26.773
If I have to sit through another meeting
about some stupid computer program...

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:32.446
...stupid computer program...

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:34.381
Listen,

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:37.484
I can get so wrapped up in crimefighting
and trying to save the world

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:41.555
that I don't spend enough time
thinking about other people's feelings.

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:45.058
When my father built this company,
it wasn't to help his bottom line.

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.828
It was to help Gotham
as a whole.

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:51.298
I forgot that's what
makes a community great.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:55.535
What makes a family great isn't
leaving and starting over.

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.771
It's learning to stick
together.

01:12:57.773 --> 01:12:59.708
Especially in the tough times.

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:04.711
I owe you both
an apology.

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:07.347
You have the ability
to be heroes.

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:10.919
And I'm sorry if my selfishness
got in the way of that.

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:26.566
Secondary
protocol aborted.

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:28.034
Apology accepted.

01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:30.437
Entering sleep mode.

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:37.744
Oh, man,
that was close.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.946
Jason, I meant
what I said.

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:43.417
- I never meant to hurt you.
- That means a lot.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:47.120
- I'm sorry for running away.
- Just promise me you'll never do it again.

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:48.221
I promise.

01:13:48.223 --> 01:13:51.291
Now, how about
we go home?

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.592
Great idea.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:55.295
- Is my room still there?
- Of course it is.

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:57.431
Alfred turned it into
a hot yoga studio

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:59.299
but the actual room
is still there.

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:01.735
- Seriously?
- Don't worry,

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:05.038
there are 51 other rooms
to choose from.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.506
And then, thank you,

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:09.409
we stuck all our vehicles
together and had to stop

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:11.678
the satellite from crashing
to the ground.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.513
I'm impressed, Robin.

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:16.349
It's obvious to me that you are
ready for more responsibility.

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:18.819
- I totally am.
- Excellent.

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:20.889
Ace, here, needs to be walked.

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.292
And after that,
we'll go on patrol.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.060
Yes!

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:29.029
Bark! Bark!

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:32.267
Can I interest anyone
in a post-fight croissant?

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:40.273
Aw, you do care.

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:46.313
You got room
for a player two?

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.381
I don't think you
could handle it, old man.

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:51.885
I defeated Darkseid,
I think I can handle it.

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:55.822
All right, the B button is for punching
and the A button is for kicking.

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:59.626
The A button is closer and
kicking is more effective at long range.

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:00.961
That's just the way it is.

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:02.762
To access the various
special moves,

01:15:02.764 --> 01:15:04.197
you need to hit
the "Start" button.

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:05.932
And which one
is the "Start" button?

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:07.901
No, no, not that one,
that's "Select."

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:09.769
So, select
and start are different?

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:11.940
Yeah.

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:44.204
It sure was nice of Mr. Wayne to
build this brand-new orphanage.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:46.840
Plus the exclusive he's
going to give to my podcast.

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:48.944
Speaking of which,
I can't be late.

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:55.749
Hmm?

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.752
Huh?

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:00.887
Billy Batson.

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:04.991
You have been found worthy.

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.092
That voice.

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.299
Huh?

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.070
Climb aboard

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:21.109
for the adventure of
a lifetime.
