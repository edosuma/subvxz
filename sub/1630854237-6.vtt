I'm sorry.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.587

And you didn't think
I did?

00:54.655 --> 00:55.789
I'm telling you now.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.825
I'm not pregnant.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.195
Wow.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.531
I can't believe you took
a pregnancy test without me.

No, you're not.

You're reacting to the part

You're reacting to the part

I am not pregnant, Maya.
Did you hear that part?

01:14.608 --> 01:16.043
I did.

O-Okay, I thought--

01:38.766 --> 01:40.067
I thought it worked, okay?

01:40.067 --> 01:42.570
You seemed so pregnant.

01:44.572 --> 01:45.906
How did I
"seem so pregnant"?

01:45.906 --> 01:47.675
I don't know.

01:47.675 --> 01:50.378
Mood swings and--
and snacking and symptoms--

01:50.378 --> 01:51.879
symptoms
of being pregnant.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.282
Those are symptoms of being
a human being, Maya.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.883
Okay, you know what?
I'm going to work.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.919
Bailey's Reproductive
Care Clinic is opening today,

01:58.919 --> 02:00.821
and I can actually
make a difference there.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.725
I gotta go.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.794
No, baby.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.229
I got...

02:08.229 --> 02:09.797
fire camp with Hughes.
Mm-hmm.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.632
And I gotta get to 19 early
to get eyes...

02:11.632 --> 02:13.334
Mm-hmm.
...on some Beckett stuff.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.768
Ugh.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.970
Yeah, there have been
some concerns.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.940
What's your read on him?
Hm?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.942
Is he drinking again?

02:21.942 --> 02:24.578
Not drinking,
I don't think. Hmm.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.248
But he isn't much
of a leader.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.749
Wait, how are you
getting to work?

02:28.749 --> 02:30.318
We drove here together.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.286
You're going to 19 anyway,
I can just ride with you.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.888
I'll jump out a few blocks
from the station.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.390
You're not even joking.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.192
You know, if we weren't
this covert couple,

02:38.192 --> 02:40.728
think about the carpooling
we could do.

02:40.728 --> 02:44.332
Think about how this affair is
contributing to climate change.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.866
You're pushing again.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.301
Again?
Mm-hmm.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.702
Look at where we are.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.070
Yeah, thanks to
credit card points.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.639
We're in a hotel
in the city.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.374
Where no one can know
that we're a couple

02:53.374 --> 02:55.209
because you wanted more.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.845
And now you want to ride
to work together, too?

02:57.845 --> 03:00.848
Sully, it's too much.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.683
Then we won't do it.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.220
It's just breakfast.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.790
I like having meals
with you, okay?

03:09.790 --> 03:12.260
So if in-room dining
is the only way...

03:12.260 --> 03:14.562
You got breakfast?
Mm-hmm.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.963
French toast.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.631
Ooh.
Bacon.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.932
Yeah?

03:24.004 --> 03:25.273
Hey, you know
I have to leave at 12:00

03:25.273 --> 03:26.607
for the union thing, right?

03:26.607 --> 03:27.908
Uh, yeah, I do.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.610
From when you reminded me
last night

03:29.610 --> 03:31.779
and then again this morning
when I was in the shower

03:31.779 --> 03:33.247
and then again
when I was driving here.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.782
You genuinely believe
I'm a person

03:34.782 --> 03:36.617
who remembers
absolutely nothing?

03:36.617 --> 03:39.787
Left on the kitchen counter,
says "Girls Fire Camp".

03:39.787 --> 03:41.289
I don't-- Mm.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.091
Really sucks that
you're abandoning me today.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.826
Technically,
you abandoned me,

03:45.826 --> 03:47.295
because you were supposed to go
to this union thing with me.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.762
Okay, well,
you know what?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.298
That was before Eli was
running the show.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.433
And it's gonna be so much
better with him, right?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.668
It's gonna be way less fun,
but it's gonna be better.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.004
It will be less fun,
but it'll be better.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.641
Lightning storm in
the forecast and now this?

04:00.641 --> 04:02.510
Thanks a lot, Trav.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.312
Lightning storms?
Today?

04:06.179 --> 04:08.649
Travis won't stop
gushing about Eli.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.150
Prompted by me, sure,
but it's like,

04:10.150 --> 04:11.785
you know,
read the room, you know?

04:11.785 --> 04:13.086
I mean,
I was doing the job... Yeah.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.488
...and now someone better
is doing it,

04:14.488 --> 04:17.525
and that's great,
but, I mean,

04:17.525 --> 04:19.159
maybe I'm not the best person
to talk about the new guy with.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.594
No, I'm not either.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.730
I-I was hate-Googling him
last night.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.197
Okay, I mean,
I don't hate him.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.766
But do we--
I don't know, do we hate him?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.001
I-I hate the type.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.604
Like, he's too smart,
too charming,

04:30.604 --> 04:33.240
too involved
in every do-gooder charity.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.109
Like,
what's his deal anyway?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.112
Well, I don't know. It kinda
sounds like his deal is, like,

04:39.112 --> 04:41.081
exactly what he's doing, right?

04:41.081 --> 04:42.716
I mean, honestly,
hearing that bio

04:42.716 --> 04:44.452
makes me feel
a little bit better.
The guy hasn't done anything

04:44.452 --> 04:45.586
for the campaign yet.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.489
Yeah, he will.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.291
He will, 'cause this is
just truly what he does.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.960
I guess.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.298
Eli. Eli.
Please, just hear me out,
all right?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.634
I-If someone was trying
to kill you, yeah?

05:00.634 --> 05:03.170
And in protecting yourself,
you killed him--

05:03.170 --> 05:04.772
that is just
basic self-defense.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.774
Even in court, self-defense,
not guilty.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.476
Comparing this to
involuntary manslaughter

05:08.476 --> 05:09.843
is really not helping
your argument here.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.445
Dixon leaked a story

05:11.445 --> 05:13.414
that makes you look like
you have rage issues.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.282
We have something about him
that could change the narrative.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.117
Leaking the Dixon Crisis One
call could jeopardize

05:17.117 --> 05:18.586
the jobs of the people
on the call

05:18.586 --> 05:20.721
and threaten the existence
of Crisis One itself.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.356
Eli, I'm serious!

05:22.356 --> 05:23.391
Well, how are you planning
to beat him, then?

05:23.391 --> 05:25.359
Are we in this,
or are we not?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.462
Hey, Ben.

05:28.462 --> 05:31.198
Please meet Eli Stern,
my new campaign manager.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.534
The man who's
gonna make my life

05:33.534 --> 05:35.235
a whole lot easier?

05:35.235 --> 05:37.738
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for one of those.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.641
I'm in a non-fight
with my wife right now.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.976
She-- She started this
new reproductive clinic,

05:42.976 --> 05:45.012
and she wants me
to do anesthesiology there

05:45.012 --> 05:47.347
when she knows
that I work here.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.216
Oh, a-and get this,
get this--

05:49.216 --> 05:51.385
she goes

05:51.385 --> 05:53.186
"But aren't you
just on desk duty?"

05:53.186 --> 05:54.788
This sounds like
a regular fight.

05:54.788 --> 05:58.459
I am on desk duty most days
for our family,

05:58.459 --> 06:00.528
not because I like it,
not because I like it.

06:00.528 --> 06:04.031
You know, I can't just--
I can't just drop everything

06:04.031 --> 06:08.135
because of what she got herself
into over there, right? Right?

06:08.135 --> 06:10.037
Oh, yeah,
no, yeah, totally.
Yeah, yeah, of course.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.272
You know, and today,
I'm not even on desk duty.

06:12.272 --> 06:15.142
Today
I'm a firefighter.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.644
She can't take that
away from me.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.912
Dude.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.948
Uh, I'm s--
Uh, what is he doing here?

06:20.948 --> 06:22.416
This camp is not
a campaign event.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.284
Everything can be a campaign
event if you have an Eli.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.253
An Eli?
Yeah.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.688
Uh, can I give you guys
a hand with this stuff?

06:27.688 --> 06:30.257
Uh, no, I'm pretty sure
I'm stronger than you.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.992
Plus, most of this stuff
is dusty,

06:31.992 --> 06:33.861
and you look like
a guy with allergies.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.629
Ooh!

06:39.700 --> 06:42.603
So, today is the first day
of your FD careers.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.937
Today we're gonna teach you

06:43.937 --> 06:45.473
what it means
to be a firefighter,

06:45.473 --> 06:47.174
and we're gonna treat you
like firefighters.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.943
So every shift begins
with a lineup.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.512
And, uh, you're gonna
introduce yourselves,

06:51.512 --> 06:52.880
and, like real firefighters,

06:52.880 --> 06:54.482
you're gonna use
your last names, okay?

06:54.482 --> 06:56.517
You're gonna leave all
of your issues

06:56.517 --> 06:58.519
and your self-doubt at the door
with your first names.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.520
All right?

06:59.520 --> 07:00.854
So, today, we are...

07:00.854 --> 07:01.922
Herrera.

07:01.922 --> 07:02.923
Warren.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.324
Bishop.
Sullivan.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.325
Over here?

07:05.325 --> 07:06.326
O'Hare.
Mm-hmm.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.861
Coles.
Davila.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.396
Sophie.
She said last names.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.534
It's okay.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.568
Santos.
That's good.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.770
Thank you.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.606
Hendrix.
Lupex.
Whoa,
is that lightning?

07:18.606 --> 07:20.440
Okay, you know what?
Let's just get started, huh?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.775
Come on, everyone,
let's suit up.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.677
Um...

07:23.677 --> 07:26.914
Should we go inside?
Well, it's far away.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.116
The weather report said
it's still miles outside
of Seattle, so...

07:29.116 --> 07:30.584
Uh...

07:33.220 --> 07:34.955
Look, everybody
knows this, right?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.624
You count
the number of seconds

07:36.624 --> 07:38.659
between the flash of lightning
and the thunder,

07:38.659 --> 07:40.393
and then you divide
by five for the distance
of the storm in miles.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.394
Right.
Right?

07:41.394 --> 07:42.763
That's what it is.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.165
So, 9, 10.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.500
Oh, my God,
it's so far away.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.768
It's so far away.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.609
Wow, impressive.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.512
Gonna be honest--

07:58.512 --> 08:00.147
a little starstruck.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.281
Ah,
you're a runner, too?

08:01.281 --> 08:03.250
Yeah, track and field
at school, but--

08:03.250 --> 08:05.619
I mean, you're Olympic,
so, wow.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.920
I also listen to dispatch
all the time,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.789
and I hear your name
a lot, so...

08:08.789 --> 08:09.823
You listen to dispatch?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.224
Yeah. Fire nerd.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.060
Obsessed.
Good, you have to be.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.562
You have to be
single-focused,

08:14.562 --> 08:16.196
more determined
than anyone else here,

08:16.196 --> 08:17.865
and have the mental
and physical strength

08:17.865 --> 08:18.732
to work through the pain.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.333
Get out there.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.402
Right here.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.871
Ready? Let's go.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.238
Very nice, very nice.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.340
Oh.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.843
When thunder roars,
you go indoors.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.713
Okay, you are so much hotter
than rhyming wisdom,

08:32.713 --> 08:33.814
whi--
Ooh.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.215
There you go.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.484
One, two...

08:37.484 --> 08:39.486
Yeah, he's right.
We gotta call it.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.755
Chief, we don't--
There is plenty for them
to learn inside.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.257
All right, I need all
these girls inside right now!

08:44.257 --> 08:46.426
Let's go!
Let's pull it in!

08:46.426 --> 08:48.862
Pick up a cone,
we're heading inside.
Follow me, follow me.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.564
All right, ladies,
come in here.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.566
We're just gonna stack
the cones right on that X.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.402
X marks the spot here.
Right here. Yep.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.237
Thank you, and then
we're gonna line up.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.706
We're gonna
line up again, okay?

08:58.706 --> 09:00.674
<i>Aid Car 19, Ladder 19,
Engine 19...</i>

09:00.674 --> 09:02.475
All right,
all right, this way, this way.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.444
Come on, ladies.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.913
Right in here,
right in here.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.615
You can watch
through your window.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.583
Let's go, let's go.
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.919
Efficiency and with
urgency, efficiency and urgency.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.954
I like to see it.
This way, this way.
This way.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.923
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey! It's a call,
not a parade, Beckett.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.692
How 'bout we set a good example
for our team and our guests?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.828
Move! Let's go.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.798
Good, now let's
line up here, ladies.
I like that teamwork.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.299
Oh, yeah, nice, nice.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.135
Hey, how long
do you think you'll be?

09:28.135 --> 09:29.469
This union endorsement
is no joke.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.638
You can't miss the meeting.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.139
He's a firefighter.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.473
I'm pretty sure
the firefighters' union

09:33.473 --> 09:35.342
will understand
if Travis is a little late

09:35.342 --> 09:37.678
because he's busy
fighting a fire.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.847
Oh!
What she said.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.201
Gibson.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.370
Yeah, I was
looking for Herrera,

10:03.370 --> 10:05.405
but I guess they're out?
I need you in there helping
Hughes with fire camp.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.874
Perfect. Two birds. Um...

10:06.874 --> 10:08.842
Team got a call
because of course

10:08.842 --> 10:10.744
there's a lightning storm
on the day of this fire camp.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.680
And I can't leave a station full
of teenagers with just Hughes,

10:12.680 --> 10:15.215
so I need to be here
dealing with citywide chaos.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.750
I need you in there
helping Vic.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.252
Uh, well, uh
Uh, I--

10:19.252 --> 10:20.954
I don't work here.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.122
Well, thank you
for volunteering.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.491
Go.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.108
There are survivors
in that?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.810
We shall see.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.979
Wiggins, Klyne, get a protection
line-- foam that fuel!

10:45.979 --> 10:48.115
Sullivan, Herrera,
assess the pilot.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.317
Montgomery, Warren,
medical on the passengers.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.286
Everyone else,
extrication tools!

10:54.988 --> 10:56.790
Quickly and with focus,
boys and girls.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.958
The lightning that
brought this down

10:57.958 --> 11:00.293
could just as easily screw us!

11:00.293 --> 11:02.629
You know, you want
to inspire the team?

11:02.629 --> 11:04.965
Calling us kittens and boys
and girls isn't the way to go.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.466
Oh, I didn't realize
daily inspiration

11:06.466 --> 11:08.401
was also your
expectation of me.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.971
This is the FD, Ru-is,
not a self-help seminar.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.239
It's Ruiz.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.540
My name's pronounced <i>Ru-iz.</i>

11:13.540 --> 11:14.742
Okay.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.309
Hey, hey.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.011
Look at Bishop.
She's not okay.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.379
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.248
No, dude, she shouldn't
even be here.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.750
Is there a problem
over there, you two?!

11:24.651 --> 11:25.886
Herrera, you're supposed
to be assessing the helo.
I know, I know.
I was just gonna make sure--

11:25.886 --> 11:28.488
Go where your captain
is telling you!

11:34.194 --> 11:36.129
Hey!
Can you hear me in there?

11:36.129 --> 11:39.032
My name is Travis.
This is Ben.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.600
We're here to help
you guys, okay?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.202
It doesn't look good
in there, Warren.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.204
Hey, how we doing
in there?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.206
Um, I think I'm okay,
but Jonathan--

11:46.206 --> 11:47.941
This can't be good, right?

11:47.941 --> 11:50.277
Well, I've seen worse.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.380
Oh, you sound like her.
Isabel's always trying
to keep it positive.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.982
Keep everyone alert
and alive.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.616
Alive?
Best producer out there.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.051
Look at where we're at
because of me!

11:58.051 --> 11:59.552
There's a pole
through your leg.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.989
I'm the one who insisted
we fly in the storm.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.690
Oh, my God.
This is all my fault.

12:03.690 --> 12:06.593
Isabel, this isn't on you.
You didn't force me to do this.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.428
Okay, Isabel, we're gonna
get you out of there,

12:08.428 --> 12:11.331
but you gotta help us
by remaining calm, okay?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.466
What about Omar, the pilot?
Is he okay?

12:13.466 --> 12:15.635
Our colleagues are working
on him in the front right now.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.204
Okay.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.644
Whoo!
Wow, thank you.
Thank you.

12:24.644 --> 12:25.946
All right, Gibson,
let's go.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.247
Yep.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.552
No, i-it's my wrist.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.822
I had injury, so... Right.
Whatever you say, guy.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.489
I did.
It was really bad.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.158
All right. O'Hare,
show him how it's done.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.359
Let's go.

12:40.894 --> 12:44.064
Whoo! Very nice!

12:44.064 --> 12:46.566
All the way down.
Santos, you're up.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.739
That's okay.
Try again.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.341
No, I don't--
I really don't want to.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.076
It was-- It was already
better than mine.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.445
Look,
I said I don't want to.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.247
Okay, Gibson, you want
to take over for a second?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.115
Yeah, l-let's roll these
bad boys up.
Santos, come here.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.953
Look, can I please just go now?
This really isn't for me.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.520
Okay, it is just day one, right?

13:07.520 --> 13:10.157
I'm not good at things
on day two, three, or 53 either.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.325
This is why my parents
are making me try this.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.626
Okay.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.163
Look, I wasn't great
at any of this stuff

13:16.163 --> 13:19.166
when I was at the academy,
and look at me now, right?

13:19.166 --> 13:22.635
Okay, all of this is so much
more about your head

13:22.635 --> 13:24.771
than any of
the physical stuff.

13:24.771 --> 13:28.141
And you're obviously one of
the smartest ones here, right?

13:28.141 --> 13:30.577
See? Yeah, you know it.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.412
Only smart people
make themselves nuts

13:32.412 --> 13:34.214
about what they're good at
or not good at.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.484
Okay?

13:37.484 --> 13:38.685
Try it again, huh?

13:38.685 --> 13:40.153
You got it.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.123
Firefighter, leader,
and a shrink,

13:43.123 --> 13:44.791
that's very nice.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.160
Thanks, Chief. Thanks.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.695
Question for you.
Yeah?

13:48.695 --> 13:50.097
What's your take
on Captain Beckett?

13:51.198 --> 13:53.533
Um, uh, I-I think he--
it's--

13:53.533 --> 13:55.335
he must be
in a tough position.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.704
Honesty over diplomacy, please.

13:57.704 --> 14:01.208
Okay. Um...

14:01.208 --> 14:02.910
Well, here it is--

14:02.910 --> 14:06.313
Uh, he is a bare minimum guy
in a house of overachievers.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.549
We're a "how do you go above
and beyond" kinda house,

14:09.549 --> 14:11.084
and he's a "sit around an wait
for your pension to kick in"

14:11.084 --> 14:12.719
kinda captain.

14:12.719 --> 14:16.023
And it's a bummer and starting
to affect everything.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.625
Wow, you just distilled
into two sentences

14:18.625 --> 14:20.860
what I couldn't
even put into words.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.062
Thank you.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.865
It's looking great, team.
Love to see it.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.969
Keep it up.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.770
All right,
Girls Camp?

14:30.770 --> 14:32.940
Girls Camp!

14:32.940 --> 14:35.775
Hey, I'm Andy.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.146
And that's
Sullivan over there.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.647
I'm-- I'm Omar.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.083
Omar, save your energy.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.819
I-I tried to land to take
the brunt of--

14:46.819 --> 14:48.221
brunt of the impact.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.357
Yep, and you succeeded,
my friend.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.926
Looks like your passengers
are gonna be okay because of it.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.461
You're--
You're a hero.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.864
I ju-- I jus--
I just don't know--

14:57.864 --> 14:59.666
don't know any other way.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.834
Exactly what
a hero would say.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.871
When you're a pilot,
you're-- you're in command.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.839
Y-You keep
your people safe.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.875
You're a good man, Omar.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.377
I wish more people
thought like you.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.482
Dad?

15:15.482 --> 15:16.783
D-Dad?

15:16.783 --> 15:18.051
Dad, what are you--
what are you--

15:18.051 --> 15:19.819
What's my da--
What's my dad, um...

15:22.089 --> 15:25.993
Dad, I--
I've missed you.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.528
M-My dad's here.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.532
Yeah?

15:43.110 --> 15:45.612
He's gone, Andy.
I know, I know.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.416
I'm just gonna...

15:52.352 --> 15:53.520
I know.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.222
Andy, he's gone.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.889
I know. I...

15:56.889 --> 15:58.925
Andy!

15:58.925 --> 16:00.560
He's gone.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.771
He gave his life
to save his passengers.

16:17.210 --> 16:17.944
Focus, focus, focus.
Okay, hey!

16:20.047 --> 16:21.781
Those two breaths didn't go in.
What do we do next?

16:21.781 --> 16:23.250
What do we do?
Oh, you re-tilt the airway
and try again?

16:23.250 --> 16:24.817
Yes!
Very nice, very nice.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.586
Okay, so those two breaths
did go in.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.021
And now what?

16:28.021 --> 16:29.356
Two breaths, five cycles...
This is so boring.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.191
I did this in
lifeguard training.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.959
Can we please go back
to doing firefighter stuff?

16:32.959 --> 16:34.394
This is firefighter stuff.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.529
This is boring.
Okay, well, it's CPR.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.232
All right, well,
you know, make them do it

16:39.232 --> 16:41.301
to the beat of
"Achy Breaky Heart".

16:41.301 --> 16:42.969
A song literally none of them
are gonna know?

16:42.969 --> 16:44.404
Really?
"Stayin' Alive"?

16:44.404 --> 16:47.074
They're 17-year-olds, Jack. Right.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.808
Uh, uh, um...
Oh, please.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.010
Right, okay, uh, I think
it might help

16:51.010 --> 16:53.746
if we do it to the beat of,
uh, "Baby Shark".

16:53.746 --> 16:55.982
Oh, God, no.
No, no!
Yes! Yeah!

16:55.982 --> 16:57.750
All right, so...

16:57.750 --> 17:00.420
♪ Baby Shark,
doo doo, doo-doo-doo ♪

17:00.420 --> 17:02.889
♪ Baby Shark, doo doo doo
You are evil!

17:02.889 --> 17:04.791
♪ Baby Shark, doo doo doo
That's gonna be stuck in all
of our heads for literally days.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.560
Which is exactly where
your CPR training should be.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.263
Right?
So, again now.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.299
♪ Baby Shark, doo doo

17:12.299 --> 17:14.867
You guys laugh,
but this is important.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.304
But it's also
still <i>so</i> boring.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.639
I agree.
This is literally one of
the most important

17:19.639 --> 17:21.274
things you could
learn all day.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.442
Well, right, but if we're out
there fighting a fire,

17:22.442 --> 17:23.643
we wouldn't be
doing this stuff.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.545
Wouldn't the paramedics
be doing it?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.280
Well...
Okay, but a paramedic
and a firefighter

17:27.280 --> 17:28.448
are one in the same
out in the field,

17:28.448 --> 17:30.083
and equally as important.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.485
Equally?

17:32.485 --> 17:34.254
I'd even argue that
it's more important.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.790
When I was in Iraq,
another soldier and I

17:37.790 --> 17:39.459
were on a recon mission,

17:39.459 --> 17:42.129
and we had to stay the night
in a safe house.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.364
It got shelled
while we were there.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.766
My partner had a bullet
go through his lung.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.501
We couldn't get extracted.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.704
So with just the supplies
from our walking packs

17:51.704 --> 17:54.441
and half a bottle of whiskey
that the last people had left,

17:54.441 --> 17:57.710
I had to sedate him,
intubate him,

17:57.710 --> 17:59.812
and then do compressions
on and off all night long

17:59.812 --> 18:01.348
because he kept
losing his pulse.

18:01.348 --> 18:04.117
4 hours and 17 minutes.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.885
I'm in love with her.
Right?

18:05.885 --> 18:10.323
It was this moment of instinct
and training and purpose

18:10.323 --> 18:12.859
all coming together.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.162
I wouldn't be in the place
that I am right now

18:15.162 --> 18:18.598
without a class
just like this one.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.999
And now I'm everybody's boss.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.934
Y'all get that, right?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.836
All right. Great.

18:23.836 --> 18:27.374
So why don't we give it
another shot, huh, with heart?

18:27.374 --> 18:29.409
Gibson, what was that song?
Uh...

18:29.409 --> 18:31.444
♪ Baby Shark, doo doo
doo-doo-doo ♪

18:31.444 --> 18:32.612
Hey.
♪ Baby Shark

18:44.924 --> 18:46.959
One, two, three.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.295
What about him?

18:48.295 --> 18:49.596
What about Jonathan?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.564
He's next.
I can't leave him!

18:51.564 --> 18:54.567
We wouldn't be in this mess
if it wasn't for me.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.237
What about Omar, the pilot?
Did he make it?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.938
Ma'am, our team's
all over this,

18:58.938 --> 19:00.340
and we're the best there is,
all right?

19:00.340 --> 19:01.574
We're gonna get you over
to Seattle Pres.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.075
And we're gonna keep you
posted on your guys.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.311
C-collar.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.683
Uh, I'm feeling
a little weird.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.620
Okay, well,
weird how, Jonathan?

19:13.620 --> 19:14.787
Like, uh-- Like pain?

19:14.787 --> 19:16.956
Not really pain.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.758
It's more tingly?
Where?

19:18.758 --> 19:22.061
Like, uh, in your legs?
Yeah, maybe.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.530
I don't think I can really feel
my legs.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.033
Okay. Well, you know what?
That's, uh--

19:27.033 --> 19:28.801
That's good for us
to know.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.003
Just let us know
if anything changes, all right?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.041
Hey, Sullivan.
Sullivan!

19:35.041 --> 19:36.476
I need you
to tell Beckett

19:36.476 --> 19:38.411
that we're gonna pull
the whole seat out of there.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.480
If we try to cut that rod
and extract him,

19:40.480 --> 19:42.215
we could cause
total paralysis.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.883
Got it.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.388
Yeah, but I need
regular updates on 81's status

19:48.388 --> 19:49.856
and the companies
on the construction site

19:49.856 --> 19:51.190
by Green Lake, okay?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.725
<i>Copy, Chief.</i>

19:52.725 --> 19:54.261
Vic, what are you
doing out here?

19:54.261 --> 19:58.765
Uh, the-- Uh, they're
on a break, so-- and I'm--

19:58.765 --> 20:02.034
Sorry, Chi-- Uh, you kind of
blew my mind back there.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.103
Blew your mind how?
Yeah, I...

20:06.072 --> 20:10.443
I don't think I've ever f-felt
like that about any of this.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.480
How you felt
in that safe house,

20:13.480 --> 20:16.249
right in the pocket, the clarity
and the-- the purpose--

20:16.249 --> 20:19.286
I just don't think I have ever
felt like that about anything.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.454
Okay, now--
No, uh, Chief,
I just feel like I'm always--

20:21.454 --> 20:23.656
I'm always just floating
around in the tide.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.693
I'm never the one driving the
boat. I'm never even in a boat.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.261
Okay, so--
I'm just-- Here--
No, I'm sorry.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.029
Here I am
telling these girls

20:30.029 --> 20:31.698
that this is the greatest
job in the world...
Mm-hmm.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.132
...and that everything else just
makes more sense inside of this,

20:33.132 --> 20:34.634
and I do not know
if I believe that.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.836
Hughes, there's a lot
going on right now.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.438
I need you to stay on ta--
Okay, but how did you--

20:38.438 --> 20:40.072
how did you know that
your pocket was your pocket?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.610
Because I want to be like that,
I want to feel like that.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.979
Vic, I'm sor-- I'm gonna
have to stop you right there.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.481
Yeah.
I'm helping you
with fire camp.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.149
I'm dealing with a citywide
lightning storm.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.884
This may not be
the perfect moment

20:51.884 --> 20:53.353
for a mentoring session, okay?
Understood, understood.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.687
Okay.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.222
Thank you, Chief.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.557
All right, Jonathan,
not much longer.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.927
Hey, hey, Jonathan.
Jonathan, hey.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.595
Hey. We're in the homestretch
now, okay?

21:02.595 --> 21:05.732
Just stay calm.
Stay with us. Stay with us.

21:05.732 --> 21:09.402
I feel so stupid.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.838
I wanted to be a war
correspondent, you know?

21:11.838 --> 21:14.374
Sounds silly,
but it felt like a calling.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.377
I got it,
and I ignored it.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.211
Well, I didn't ignore it.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.513
I gave it up.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.914
For my wife.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.716
That sounds romantic.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.620
Not really.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.121
Made me hate her.

21:30.557 --> 21:33.393
I mean, not hate her,
but resent her.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.295
Which is worse, I think, 'cause
I'm not mean to anyone but her.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.930
I'm serious!

21:37.930 --> 21:40.500
To everyone else,
I'm the best guy in the world.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.503
You know what I thought when you
guys started to whisper about me

21:43.503 --> 21:46.473
possibly having
a spinal injury?

21:46.473 --> 21:47.940
Wait,
y-y-you heard that?

21:47.940 --> 21:49.742
I'm a really good reporter.

21:49.742 --> 21:52.579
I heard you and I thought,
"That'll show her."

21:52.579 --> 21:55.515
Because she'd have to take care
of my paralyzed ass forever.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.316
The ultimate punishment.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.285
I actually had that thought
in the middle of all this.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.853
How screwed up is that?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.589
I'm sure you're under
a lot of stress,

22:02.589 --> 22:04.691
and I'm sure you didn't mean
to say anything like that--

22:04.691 --> 22:06.726
Oh, I meant every bit.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.830
Who knew
it could get worse?

22:10.830 --> 22:14.133
That what I'm feeling now
would be more awful

22:14.133 --> 22:15.968
and terrifying than that?

22:15.968 --> 22:17.404
Jonathan.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.038
Jonathan, what're you
feeling now?

22:19.038 --> 22:20.407
'Cause to be honest,
I'm a little bit afraid

22:20.407 --> 22:22.074
of what
the answer's gonna be.

22:22.074 --> 22:26.012
Desperately, frantically,
painfully in love with her.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.381
I have to fix this.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.349
If I'm in this marriage,
I have to be in it.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.584
I love her.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.420
We got you.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.587
We're gonna take care of you.
You're gonna be okay.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.922
Warren.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.724
I'll be right back.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.095
Beckett's
not going for it.

22:45.932 --> 22:50.236
Hey. Hey, Jonathan, buddy,
better late than never.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.371
I believe in you.
Look at where you are.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.741
You're already casually
defying the odds.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.576
Okay?

22:56.576 --> 22:58.878
No, Captain, I hear that,
but medically speaking,

22:58.878 --> 23:01.080
I'm telling you...
Just because you think
you also have X-ray eyes

23:01.080 --> 23:03.450
doesn't mean we're gonna
make life riskier for this team.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.084
The longer
we stay out here,

23:05.084 --> 23:06.919
the greater the chance
that one of us gets fried.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.655
Respectfully, Captain,
I'm a doctor--
No, Warren.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.322
The safest and fastest
thing to do

23:10.322 --> 23:12.091
is to cut that man
out of that chair--

23:12.091 --> 23:14.126
Oh, my God!
This is ridiculous.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.762
Excuse me?
No, she's actually right.

23:15.762 --> 23:16.963
We are wasting time.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.330
You're out of line, too, Herrera.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.199
Ben knows what
he's talking about!

23:20.199 --> 23:21.100
And you have--
Captain, I know
what I'm saying, all right?

23:21.100 --> 23:22.702
This is how
we save this man.

23:22.702 --> 23:25.271
He's a doctor.
You need to listen.

23:25.271 --> 23:27.273
All right, you know what?
You seem like you really want

23:27.273 --> 23:28.641
to run the show, Herrera,
so why don't you?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.477
Let's see how you do, hm?

23:30.477 --> 23:32.044
Change of plans, everyone.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.380
We're extricating
in the chair!

23:40.419 --> 23:41.454
Ruiz, Bishop, Cutler, V struts
and stabilize that helo.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.158
Montgomery, open up that
left side and get us egress.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.894
Everyone else,
we need all hands...

No.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.247
What?

25:15.247 --> 25:17.249
I needed this.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.818
You know, working
with the girls and you

25:18.818 --> 25:20.086
and doing something
I'm good at.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.821
Oh, buddy.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.723
Didn't mind them being
super mean to me, either.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.758
Of course you didn't.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.326
What is that?

25:27.326 --> 25:28.595
Obviously I didn't
grow up with family,

25:28.595 --> 25:30.262
but watching
other people's,

25:30.262 --> 25:32.031
I thought the thing
that distinguished it

25:32.031 --> 25:34.801
from everyone else was that
you could give each other crap

25:34.801 --> 25:36.803
or mess up, and they'd still
have to love you, you know?

25:36.803 --> 25:40.206
Couldn't kick you out of
the circle or return you.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.248
What's that?

25:51.450 --> 25:53.786
Me as a baby.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.922
My bio-sister
dropped it off.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.324
And my parents have been
holding onto it for years.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.761
Apparently they did love me,
they just...

26:02.895 --> 26:03.796
...didn't like me.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.464
Jack.

26:05.464 --> 26:06.633
Come on, that's--
that's different.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.034
You know it is.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.936
And if you don't, I'm--
I'm telling you.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.838
And I can be as mean about it
as you need me to be

26:11.838 --> 26:13.873
for it to sink in.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.108
Jack, they--
they loved you.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.910
And they couldn't keep you.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.647
Okay?

26:25.117 --> 26:27.019
So, you got a sister
sniffing around, huh?

26:27.019 --> 26:28.287
How do we feel about that?

26:28.287 --> 26:29.822
Curious, I guess.
I don't know.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.958
Confused.
Okay.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.660
Those are normal
and appropriate feelings.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.327
I can work with that.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.896
Thank you. Yeah.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.407
Stop! Hold!

26:48.407 --> 26:51.177
Hold, hold.
Bishop, step away.

26:51.177 --> 26:51.878
Thought you were
running the scene.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.079
I'm doing exactly that.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.515
Hold him up. Stable.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.117
We got it.
I'm coming around.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.725
Okay, just remember you
are its brains, all right?

27:05.725 --> 27:07.593
I'm right behind you. Good.

27:07.593 --> 27:10.663
Oh! That's good, that's good.
Right in the work.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.399
Perfect.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.635
What the...

27:16.635 --> 27:17.970
Give me this,
give me this, Santos.

27:17.970 --> 27:21.607
Help! Help!
You have to help me!

27:21.607 --> 27:23.843
Somebody, Help!
Girls, get back! Get back!
Everybody, get back!

27:23.843 --> 27:25.845
Help, please!
Okay, sir!

27:25.845 --> 27:26.946
You have to help me!

27:26.946 --> 27:28.414
Sir.
Please!

27:28.414 --> 27:30.416
Hold on. Slow down,

27:30.416 --> 27:32.618
Stay back there.
Right here, right here.

27:32.618 --> 27:33.986
You gotta help!

27:33.986 --> 27:35.922
They were struck by lightning.

27:43.029 --> 27:43.963
We were just getting to
my mom's for Sunday lunch.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.566
She said not to come
in the storm.

27:47.566 --> 27:49.335
Monitors. We gotta get them all
on monitors with defib pads.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.503
What does that mean?
Are they going to be okay?

27:51.503 --> 27:53.806
Hey, back up, back up.
Enzo, Enzo.
Just keep talking to me, okay?

27:53.806 --> 27:55.474
They were
unloading the car.

27:55.474 --> 27:57.176
We've been bringing her
supplies for the week.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.410
Lightning hit the ground
or something.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.179
I was still in the car.
It should have been me.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.248
No, no, no, it's good it wasn't.
You got them here, right?

28:02.248 --> 28:03.716
Hey, hey, let me work. Dispatch,
this is Chief Ross.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.484
I need three aid cars
to Station 19

28:05.484 --> 28:07.854
for three post-lightning
cardiac arrests.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.989
<i>Chief, every aid car

28:09.989 --> 28:11.523

28:11.523 --> 28:13.059
Just give me what you can
when you can.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.526
Suddenly they all fell
and were out.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.928
I threw them in the trunk
and just brought them him.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.029
You did that yourself?
Charging.

28:21.834 --> 28:22.902
Chief,
we need more hands.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.470
I know, uh...

28:28.307 --> 28:30.076

this morning.

36:40.065 --> 36:41.132
No, what was that
on the call today?

36:41.132 --> 36:42.968
You just checked out.

36:42.968 --> 36:46.037
No, on the contrary, you wanted
to play captain, I let you.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.474
Yeah, it's harder
than it looks, huh?
I was fine.

36:48.474 --> 36:49.941
Yeah, with the mechanics
of the call, sure,

36:49.941 --> 36:51.277
that's the easy part.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.379
It's managing your
tender personalities

36:53.379 --> 36:55.481
that makes this job
a real pain.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.319
Speaking of personality
management--

37:00.319 --> 37:01.487
You wanted to play
captain for a day,

37:01.487 --> 37:03.255
why don't you
get to it, boss?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.463
Hey.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.368
Now you care who you
embarrass me in front of?

37:16.368 --> 37:17.836
I wasn't trying
to embarrass you.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.371
I was trying
to keep people safe.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.672
I was trying to
keep you safe. No.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.809
I think you were using me
to angle for captain.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.043
Oh, get out of here.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.044
Are we--
Are we doing this again?

37:26.044 --> 37:27.546
Deny it, but I'm right.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.281
Just like I'm right about
Ross and Sullivan

37:29.281 --> 37:31.517
and just like I've been
right about Beckett.

37:31.517 --> 37:34.520
Everyone's just riding me
to distract from their own stuff

37:34.520 --> 37:36.121
and I'm sick of it.
Are you listening
to yourself?

37:36.121 --> 37:38.324
Yeah, the other night
I decided to do exactly that.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.858
Okay, so that's
what we're doing.

37:39.858 --> 37:43.462
Rogue Maya is listening
to herself?

37:43.462 --> 37:45.130
You know, I don't need
a lecture right now.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.065
I'm trying to help you.

37:47.065 --> 37:50.402
I am fighting for you,
not against you.

37:50.402 --> 37:53.605
I-I pulled you off that scene
because you do not seem okay.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.907
I know you,
when you're spiraling,

37:55.907 --> 37:57.776
when you're really sinking,
you go after me.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.912
You go after everyone.
You go after your team.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.180
Because that's what your dad
taught you to do.

38:02.180 --> 38:03.449
You go for gold alone.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.417
But me and this team,
we--

38:05.417 --> 38:07.553
we are not your competition.

38:07.553 --> 38:10.021
We are a team
you work <i>with.</i>

38:10.021 --> 38:12.958
We-- We do this together,

38:12.958 --> 38:14.860
but you have to let us.

38:14.860 --> 38:15.961
Please.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.129
Are we done here?

38:25.471 --> 38:26.972
Hey.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.173
Hi.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.076
What's wrong?

38:31.076 --> 38:32.578
I heard
it went great today.

38:32.578 --> 38:33.612
Oh, no, it was.
It was.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.246
It was great.

38:35.246 --> 38:37.115
For the girls,
for Hughes, for me.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.517
But I cannot stop thinking
about this morning.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.285
This morning?

38:40.285 --> 38:41.620
You get that we'll
probably never be able

38:41.620 --> 38:43.021
to ride to work
together, right?

38:43.021 --> 38:45.824
We'll figure it out.
I hate it.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.760
I don't know how being with you
is somehow harder than not,

38:48.760 --> 38:49.661
because that was awful.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.431
But this

38:52.431 --> 38:55.367
Sully,
this feels impossible.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.002
All right, we'll never
be able to carpool.

38:58.236 --> 39:01.673
Seattle is a big city,
we can explore its outskirts.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.709
Seattle is not as big
as you think it is.

39:03.709 --> 39:06.311
All right, well, we'll move.
How 'bout that, huh?

39:06.311 --> 39:10.048
We'll quit our jobs
and we'll move, uh, to Spain.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.717
Sully...

39:13.284 --> 39:16.054
Sorry, look, I'm not
making light of this.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.923
But what do you want
me to say, huh?

39:20.526 --> 39:23.361
I want more
and so do you.

39:23.361 --> 39:26.197
And it's not gonna change. Exactly.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.233
You know how rare it is

39:28.233 --> 39:30.802
for someone like me
to be where I am.

39:30.802 --> 39:33.939
Positions like mine are not
handed out to people like me.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.443
And even when we get them,
it stays so precarious.

39:37.443 --> 39:39.210
Sully, you know that. Profoundly.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.813
I love where I am.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.049
I deserve where I am.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.284
I'm great
at where I am.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.454
But today I realized
there's something

39:48.454 --> 39:50.889
that's more important
than that.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.492
People look up to me.

39:53.492 --> 39:56.294
People who look like me,
people who need an example

39:56.294 --> 39:58.329
of a me to know
that they can do it, too.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.265
I cannot mess this up
for myself,

40:00.265 --> 40:01.800
and I really can't mess
this up for them.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.669
Natasha, you are not listening.
Listen, I don't know

40:03.669 --> 40:05.604
how we make this work.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.807
What-- What--
Sully, I'm saying
I don't know if we can.

40:08.807 --> 40:11.109
