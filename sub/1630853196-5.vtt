A NETFLIX SERIES

00:15.000 --> 00:17.160
<i>Anyone who's taken a driving test</i>

00:17.240 --> 00:20.840
<i>knows that there's</i>
<i>a huge difference between the theory test</i>

00:20.920 --> 00:22.600
<i>and putting it into practice.</i>

00:22.680 --> 00:24.920
<i>It's the same with sexology.</i>

00:29.800 --> 00:34.240
<i>In theory, the phase of sexual desire</i>
<i>extends into the arousal phase.</i>

00:35.360 --> 00:37.520
<i>Followed by the plateau phase.</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:43.080
<i>The plateau phase</i>
<i>is also known as the solo phase.</i>

00:43.160 --> 00:45.840
<i>It's the moment</i>
<i>when you have to let go of your partner.</i>

00:46.680 --> 00:48.840
<i>You turn completely inward,</i>

00:48.920 --> 00:51.640
<i>working towards the point of no return.</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:56.960
<i>It's a phase in which uninvited images</i>
<i>can impose themselves on you.</i>

00:57.680 --> 01:01.760
<i>Luckily, I know from reading the theory</i>
<i>that it's nothing to feel guilty about</i>

01:01.840 --> 01:04.280
<i>and you shouldn't make too much of it.</i>

01:04.360 --> 01:08.480
<i>I mean, it might as well</i>
<i>have been Patrick Swayze or Don Johnson.</i>

01:09.280 --> 01:12.560
<i>At this point, it's all about you.</i>

01:12.640 --> 01:14.640
<i>And the promise of a deep,</i>

01:15.240 --> 01:16.240
<i>intense…</i>

01:16.320 --> 01:17.680
Oh Marly, I love you.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.560
<i>But that's just theory.</i>

01:26.520 --> 01:30.080
What would you say about going
to Antwerp together for the weekend?

01:30.800 --> 01:31.720
Antwerp?

01:31.800 --> 01:34.960
Yes. I've taken the liberty
of booking a hotel room.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.360
It's bigger than this one.

01:38.440 --> 01:39.720
Do you like mussels?

01:42.280 --> 01:45.160
I'm sorry, but I can't.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.280
I have to work.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.000
Then you may have to reschedule.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.440
I'm working all weekend.
It's the Chatter Box launch.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.560
-The Chatter Box.
-Yes. We've been working on it for a year.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.040
Ten people can call in at the same time
and chat with each other.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.880
And you think that would be more fun
than a real conversation with a real man

02:10.960 --> 02:13.680
in a real
award-winning Flemish restaurant?

02:13.760 --> 02:17.120
Look, Frank and Ramon have
put me in charge of all the operators,

02:17.200 --> 02:19.600
so I have to make sure
everything runs smoothly.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.960
-You should have told me sooner.
-I wanted to surprise you.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.800
Sorry.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.280
Sorry.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.160
Sorry.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.320
Quick word of advice
to those saying sorry a lot:

02:40.400 --> 02:41.440
it's not your fault.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.640
But it can take a lot of bad boyfriends
before you realize this.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.240
<i>Leon wasn't really even a boyfriend.</i>

02:48.320 --> 02:49.480
<i>He was my professor.</i>

02:49.560 --> 02:52.360
<i>We'd been seeing each other</i>
<i>once a week for a year now.</i>

02:53.000 --> 02:56.520
<i>At the start,</i>
<i>everything revolved around him in my mind.</i>

02:59.200 --> 03:01.720
<i>But lately, I'd come to realize</i>

03:01.800 --> 03:05.680
<i>that in between our rendezvous,</i>
<i>I never really thought about him anymore.</i>

03:14.520 --> 03:16.360
You turn around

03:17.480 --> 03:19.120
and I pull off your pants.

03:20.280 --> 03:25.880
But they fit so tightly
around your rock-hard ass.

03:25.960 --> 03:30.680
-Yes, that's good.
-But I can hardly get them down.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.760
I really have to peel them off.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.320
They're stuck. How is this possible?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.360
They're stuck at the front.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.000
You turn around and I see…

03:44.520 --> 03:46.360
Oh, my God.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.080
What an enormous, fat cock!

03:49.160 --> 03:51.800
No, what a shaft! Oh, my God!

03:51.880 --> 03:53.920
Huge, steaming fuckpole!

03:54.000 --> 03:57.280
-It's way too big! Let me out!
-I'm sorry. Jesus.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.200
Help! Ramon, Ronnie, help!

04:00.280 --> 04:03.000
You can really tell you're an actor.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.400
Well, it's all based on true stories.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.680
-Yes, but not at Yab Yum, I imagine?
-No, slightly different crowd.

04:08.760 --> 04:09.840
Same time tomorrow?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.600
Yes, but not too early, okay?
Because it's Thursday.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.480
-Thursday?
-Yes, Thursday.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.080
You can't not go to the RoXY
on a Thursday.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.240
-Ah, Thursday. I get it.
-Oh, do you?

04:21.320 --> 04:23.800
-Sorry, Julian. Are those the chat boxes?
-Yes.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.480
Sorry, Julian. I really have to…

04:26.000 --> 04:28.360
Tonight, will you be there?

04:29.440 --> 04:31.560
-I'm sure it'll be right up your alley.
-No.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.200
-I have to go home.
-Oh, right.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.080
Family man.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.320
We need those too.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.760
Yes. You mean a hardworking man.

04:41.880 --> 04:42.720
Dancing man?

04:43.480 --> 04:44.320
Tonight?

04:45.360 --> 04:47.160
Just make sure you're there.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.360
Around twelve?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.680
-I'll see what I can do.
-Good.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.800
Bye, Julian.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.440
Hot steaming fuckpole coming through.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.640
Nien, can you call Ronnie?
This is an epic moment.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.040
Is the engineer here?

05:20.560 --> 05:22.720
-Do you mean the English guy?
-Yes, Kennedy.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.880
Frank was supposed
to pick him up from Schiphol.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.120
What?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.040
Where's Frank?

05:36.120 --> 05:38.680
<i>Frank couldn't even tell you where he was.</i>

05:39.200 --> 05:40.040
Thirsty.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.200
<i>A year after Anouk had left him,</i>

05:42.280 --> 05:45.800
<i>he frequented the Yab Yum</i>
<i>more than was good for him.</i>

05:47.400 --> 05:50.000
-Order another one?
-No.

05:50.920 --> 05:51.840
I have to…

05:52.800 --> 05:53.880
I have to go.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.000
Yes, but…

05:55.880 --> 05:57.760
You could stay here with me.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.280
Yes, I could.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.040
Hello, Eva here.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.080
Hello?

06:22.320 --> 06:23.200
They hung up.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.320
For the umpteenth time.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.080
Must have been a dirty call.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.640
It's Leon.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.200
He's insisting that I come to Antwerp.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.760
His wife is away with the kids

06:35.840 --> 06:38.200
and "we won't get another chance
anytime soon."

06:38.280 --> 06:40.280
But the Chatter Box was my idea too.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.960
I simply have to be there.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.640
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.280
Back again?

06:51.360 --> 06:53.680
Yes. No need for Janna to panic.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.440
I was asked to play at a rave in Bristol.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.680
-It was so cool.
-Why didn't you take us along?

07:01.520 --> 07:02.800
Would you have liked it?

07:02.880 --> 07:05.120
-Yeah, man. It's Bristol.
-Yeah?

07:05.200 --> 07:06.360
It would've been great.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.600
Oh.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.200
Maybe next time.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.160
Mar.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.080
Do you know what time

07:19.920 --> 07:21.600
we have to be at Teledutch?

07:21.680 --> 07:25.800
Yes. They're expecting us at seven
for the introduction.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.000
Oh. You'd better get a move on then.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.520
-Babe.
-No, I want an apology first, dude.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.920
It was just a week.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.040
You could have called. Asshole.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.080
It's your fault, Marly.
You're leading those men on.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.840
-He did it without asking.
-He didn't need to ask.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.440
The way you looked at him…

07:44.960 --> 07:46.680
I didn't ask you either.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.640
Careful.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.120
-Yes, that's good.
-Yeah.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.760
-Easy.
-Yeah.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.120
What a beauty, hey Aiden?

08:04.160 --> 08:06.920
<i>Aiden Kennedy.</i>
<i>Inventor of the Chatter Box.</i>

08:07.440 --> 08:10.440
<i>And this is Aiden Kennedy 24 hours later.</i>

08:10.520 --> 08:13.280
<i>Not uncommon for Brits visiting Amsterdam.</i>

08:42.240 --> 08:45.760
<i>Over the past year,</i>
<i>the sex line market had exploded.</i>

08:45.840 --> 08:48.800
<i>And our competitor in Rotterdam</i>
<i>was hot on our heels.</i>

08:57.760 --> 08:58.600
Yes.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.680
Hey, Nien. Yes, sorry.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.080
I was doing a rough job.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.560
Yes, I'll be right there.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.400
TEN PEOPLE AT ONCE!

09:19.480 --> 09:20.320
"Call Box"?

09:21.080 --> 09:23.480
What? That's our idea.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.480
Our friends in Rotterdam.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.360
Rotterdam has ordered
six of those chat boxes. Six.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.000
We're only one day ahead, Frank.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.200
Our English friend is here for two days.
Tomorrow he'll be in Rotterdam.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.200
After that,
he's gone for at least a month.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.640
He's flying back home tomorrow night.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.600
Two hundred grand for those machines.
Plus a hundred grand in ads.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.840
All to launch the Chatter Box, dude.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.480
-Our number--
-Jesus, man. You're hammered already?

09:54.080 --> 09:56.720
Not yet. And not hammered.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.440
A slight buzz. There's a big difference.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.320
Listen, it's essential
that we go live first.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.120
Exactly.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.560
So if we make sure
he doesn't make it to Rotterdam tomorrow,

10:19.360 --> 10:21.400
we'll be ahead by a month.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.880
-The market will be ours.
-There's one thing for it.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.840
Pull an all-nighter.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.360
Make sure he oversleeps.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.160
How will we drink
an Englishman under the table?

10:34.120 --> 10:34.960
Johnny.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.880
Would you like a drink?
Ramon won't be back before seven anyway.

10:40.960 --> 10:41.800
Some wine?

10:42.440 --> 10:43.680
<i>Hey, Natas.</i>

10:44.680 --> 10:47.480
<i>Yeah, I'm stuck at work tonight.</i>

10:47.560 --> 10:51.360
<i>The English guy</i>
<i>is over for the Chatter Box…</i>

10:51.440 --> 10:53.160
There goes our romantic evening.

10:53.240 --> 10:57.160
<i>…we'll have to show him the city after,</i>

10:57.840 --> 10:59.320
<i>so it'll be a late one.</i>

10:59.840 --> 11:00.680
<i>Sorry.</i>

11:00.760 --> 11:04.040
Jesus, come on.
What did I send the kids away for?

11:04.120 --> 11:07.760
Well, you heard it.
You can stay for dinner. Girls night.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.600
<i>Janna and Eva were the first two operators</i>
<i>I managed to recruit for the Chatter Box.</i>

11:15.520 --> 11:18.600
<i>Three hundred bucks for one night</i>
<i>listening to mindless chatter.</i>

11:18.680 --> 11:20.800
<i>And we wouldn't even have to moan.</i>

11:20.880 --> 11:22.920
<i>But at that point,</i>
<i>Janna was the last person</i>

11:23.000 --> 11:25.560
<i>I wanted to spend a whole night with</i>
<i>in a confined space.</i>

11:35.480 --> 11:38.800
-Do you get it?
-Each machine handles ten incoming calls.

11:38.880 --> 11:41.880
When two callers want to chat
one-on-one, we can isolate them.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.040
I'll explain later, okay?

11:49.600 --> 11:52.600
…four, three, two…

12:05.280 --> 12:08.000
Welcome to the Chatter Box.
I'm Anna, your operator.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.320
Hello. It's great
that you're calling the Chatter Box.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.960
I'm Anna, your operator.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.920
Hello, everyone.
How great that you're calling in.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.360
This is Anna, your operator.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.040
-Yes.
-Yes, you can.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.040
-Welcome. I'm Anna.
-This is…

12:38.000 --> 12:38.840
Come on, Aiden.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.800
You asked him to come to the toilet,
you pancake.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.240
Yes, <i>vlammetjes </i>are good too.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.640
Chatter Box.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.720
Having a party?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.040
Here he is, John.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.440
Tsjibbe.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.640
Do you have my bottle
and a couple of glasses?

13:38.560 --> 13:40.600
Yes.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.360
-Our friend doesn't drink.
-Hey.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.840
We'll see about that.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.040
Tsjib, a glass of water, please.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.080
Here's to Chatter Box, eh?

14:30.440 --> 14:33.560
-Who else is there? Cynthia?
-I think, first of all…

14:33.640 --> 14:36.880
Yeah, if you all talk at once,
it won't work.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.640
One at a time, please.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.480
I'm not one for big words,
but this was history in the making.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.520
Let me explain.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.320
Picture the Chatter Box as a dark room.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.800
Someone dials our number. 06-9191.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.400
<i>First, there's nothing.</i>

15:01.920 --> 15:06.120
Hi, I'm Anna, your operator.
It's great you're calling in. Who are you?

15:06.640 --> 15:08.160
Hey, I'm Maud.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.280
Hi, Maud. Where do you come from?

15:10.360 --> 15:12.760
Eindhoven. Is there anyone else here?

15:12.840 --> 15:14.800
-Eindhoven.
-PSV.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.120
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

15:17.200 --> 15:20.200
-Is anyone planning anything fun?
-Yeah, with you.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.400
Can you dance?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.440
-And what else?
-Whatever you want. If you're my type.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.560
Honey, I'm everyone's type.

15:27.440 --> 15:31.560
Yo, how does this work? Anyone else here?

15:32.080 --> 15:34.480
Hi, I'm Anna, the operator.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.560
It's helpful for the others
if you introduce yourself. So who are you?

15:38.640 --> 15:42.000
Eric. Present. Is it fun here?

15:42.080 --> 15:44.800
This kind of thing.
And multiply it by three.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.440
Guys, I've just let Hanna in.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.880
It might be nice
if you introduced yourselves.

15:51.400 --> 15:55.000
-Hey, Anna, want to fuck?
-Hey. None of that, okay?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.680
-Or I'll kick you out.
-Anna.

15:58.960 --> 15:59.960
Hello, I'm Anna.

16:01.640 --> 16:02.640
This.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.080
Twenty-four hours a day,

16:05.160 --> 16:07.960
seven days a week, at 50 cents a minute.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.480
Someone was cashing in big-time here.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.560
-Exactly.
-Yes. Oh, yes.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.760
Look at him. That's his third.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.000
-He's still fairly bright-eyed.
-At least we got him drinking.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.320
Oh no, sorry. No, I have to get going.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.240
No. What's this? You're on a mission.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.720
Of course you are.

16:33.800 --> 16:38.160
No, I have to go home. The kids are away
for the weekend and I promised Natas…

16:38.240 --> 16:41.200
Come on. It's almost midnight.
Natasja's fast asleep by now.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.920
Yes. Yes, Aiden. You're in Amsterdam now.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.880
-No.
-Yes.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.040
You're no longer wearing your ring.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.960
No, it scares men off.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.240
Unlike your little man here.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.560
Yeah, well,
this is the only man in my life.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.800
Isn't that right, poppet?

17:30.880 --> 17:34.840
Being married isn't everything either.
Ramon barely touches me.

17:35.920 --> 17:39.240
He's burning up.
Surely that's not normal? Feel him.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.040
Yes.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.280
-I'll get a thermometer.
-Yeah.

17:46.880 --> 17:47.960
Hey, sweetie.

17:48.040 --> 17:51.080
Am I single?
Yes, of course. Free as a bird.

17:51.160 --> 17:54.840
After all,
this is the happy bachelor box, isn't it?

17:56.080 --> 17:58.240
Wow, what a madhouse.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.120
It's constantly packed. For you too?

18:00.200 --> 18:01.240
-Yes.
-Yes.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.040
I think they can
keep each other entertained just fine.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.480
Are we doing anything
once we're done here?

18:07.560 --> 18:09.400
To the RoXY? Is Mischa playing?

18:09.480 --> 18:12.240
-It's Thursday.
-Oh yes, Thursday.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.000
-Have you made up yet?
-No.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.360
He can sweat it out for a bit, that jerk.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.760
He just went to England for a week
without telling me.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.960
-Who knows what he got up to over there.
-Yes, thanks a lot, Eva.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.160
<i>I could have told her then,</i>

18:28.800 --> 18:32.920
<i>but how do you tell your best friend</i>
<i>that her boyfriend kissed you?</i>

18:33.440 --> 18:36.040
<i>And that you</i>
<i>actually didn't mind it at all.</i>

18:48.240 --> 18:51.200
-Come in. Hi, good evening.
-Good evening.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.800
-That's why you wanted to go to the RoXY.
-No. I didn't know.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.240
Now I know why five guys
managed to get in so easily.

19:08.920 --> 19:12.200
-Drink? I'm getting drinks.
-Okay.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.640
-John, sorry. I have to go.
-What?

19:18.720 --> 19:21.440
It's an emergency code
I agreed on with Anouk.

19:21.520 --> 19:25.200
I have to find a phone booth.
If I don't come back, you're in charge.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.200
Do what you need to. No expense spared.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.360
<i>Frank, Django is sick.</i>
<i>We're at the hospital.</i>

19:59.480 --> 20:01.840
Hello. Can I get five whiskies?

20:19.080 --> 20:20.000
There you go.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.480
Hi. Yes.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.400
Hey.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.120
-Got it?
-Yes.

20:35.840 --> 20:36.880
Where's Frank?

20:36.960 --> 20:39.080
-His buzzer went off.
-What?

20:56.760 --> 20:58.520
Okay, I'm at a loss here.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.480
I have an idea.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.040
He's guaranteed to lose all track of time.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.120
Okay, I really need to get going.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.480
He stays here, okay? Do whatever it takes.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.440
Tie him down if you must,
but he can't be in Rotterdam tomorrow.

22:04.520 --> 22:08.160
No worries, Ramon.
We'll keep ourselves entertained, okay?

22:16.640 --> 22:19.960
MAIN ENTRANCE

22:26.600 --> 22:28.120
This is an anti-inflammatory.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.000
It will help calm
the infection in his windpipe.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.040
-We're putting him on oxygen too.
-Hey.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.840
Hey, hello.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.240
-Hey.
-Are you the father?

22:37.320 --> 22:40.240
-Yes.
-Your son has a bad case of viral croup.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.240
Sorry. Is that serious?

22:42.320 --> 22:46.600
The respiratory tract is inflamed,
which is hindering his breathing.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.560
Okay, yes.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.000
We'll keep him here overnight
for observation.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.680
Yes.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.280
Hey, boy. Hey.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.720
<i>Could Constance and I go private?</i>

23:00.800 --> 23:04.920
Yes. If you want, I can let you go private
so the two of you can talk one-on-one.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.320
-Do you want that too, Marion?
-<i>Yes, great.</i>

23:08.400 --> 23:10.200
Okay, I'll let you go private now.

23:11.880 --> 23:15.520
The deal was that we wouldn't listen in
on private conversations,

23:15.600 --> 23:17.080
but we could if we wanted to.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.680
Open relationship.
LAT. Living Apart Together.

23:24.040 --> 23:28.640
Okay, so if I ran into your girlfriend,
I could just tell her we were doing it?

23:28.720 --> 23:30.320
Theoretically speaking.

23:30.400 --> 23:34.480
-No, I wouldn't want to take it that far.
-Okay, I get it.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.320
You just want to have it both ways.

23:37.160 --> 23:40.160
<i>No, it's more</i>
<i>that I don't want to rub it in.</i>

23:41.120 --> 23:44.640
<i>I mean, that would be</i>
<i>kind of humiliating for her.</i>

23:45.160 --> 23:47.360
<i>But yes, in theory…</i>

24:10.400 --> 24:13.040
<i>Hey, I would really like to meet you.</i>

24:13.720 --> 24:17.600
<i>And I… You sound really fun,</i>

24:18.120 --> 24:20.200
<i>but I'm not looking for someone to share.</i>

24:23.520 --> 24:24.840
I need a break.

24:31.440 --> 24:35.760
Oh, Jesus. What's up with these guys?

24:35.840 --> 24:38.000
"Anyone here want to get laid?"

24:38.520 --> 24:42.280
Because no one can see them, they think
they can say whatever they want.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.160
I blocked a few of them just now.

24:45.520 --> 24:46.760
What?

24:46.840 --> 24:48.280
Oh, great.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.400
The chicks don't get off scot-free either.

24:52.440 --> 24:56.880
Running after those men like tame sheep
just to get a little attention.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.600
Well, I know one of those.

25:00.600 --> 25:04.200
Yeah, I get so sick of myself sometimes,
how I am with Mischa.

25:04.280 --> 25:08.480
Honestly, he comes and goes as he pleases
and I always let him get away with it.

25:10.560 --> 25:14.960
-This is where you tell me we're a great--
-He kissed me. Mischa.

25:18.040 --> 25:18.880
What?

25:20.240 --> 25:21.080
When?

25:22.040 --> 25:25.560
This afternoon.
In the kitchen. Just before we left.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.680
-You see? I thought there was--
-But it was very short.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.360
What happened?

25:32.440 --> 25:34.840
Well, he came out the shower--

25:34.920 --> 25:36.960
So you thought,
"I'll kiss him on the mouth"?

25:37.040 --> 25:38.360
No, of course not, Jan.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.200
I didn't want it, okay?

25:40.280 --> 25:43.160
But, yes, I did let it happen.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.000
And I'm sorry.

25:49.320 --> 25:52.160
-Do you want a relationship with him?
-No, of course not.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.800
That's not even an option.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.600
There's something else I should tell you.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.040
Step it up a notch, Ramon.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.480
Come on. You can do it.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.000
Professor DeWolff?

27:21.720 --> 27:22.560
Leon.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.240
Since when?

27:25.320 --> 27:26.440
It's been a while.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.560
Quite a while.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.440
-Why have you never said anything?
-Well, I don't know.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.640
He's our professor.

27:35.360 --> 27:38.360
What if Eva found out?
He is married after all.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.200
Do you like him?

27:42.360 --> 27:44.120
Well, I…

27:44.640 --> 27:46.200
-It's mostly…
-Sex?

27:49.320 --> 27:51.840
-Oh, my God.
-He loves me.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.000
Oh, shit.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.920
-Does he have kids?
-Twins.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.880
And he loves you. Shit, man.

28:04.960 --> 28:08.040
Just one thing.
You know when Mischa kissed you?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.560
Why didn't you tell me straight away?

28:13.840 --> 28:17.560
I don't know. We've hardly spoken
these past months, Jan.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.320
-I thought you'd blame me.
-Okay, I'm really going to end this.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.520
-Really?
-Yes.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.160
Me too.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.960
It's gone on for way too long.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.160
-Really?
-Yes.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.440
Okay.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.880
I end it with Mischa,
you end it with Leon.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.520
Shall we leave?

28:54.280 --> 28:55.120
Okay.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.800
I need to piss first.

29:26.040 --> 29:26.880
Be careful.

29:30.000 --> 29:30.840
Why?

29:32.040 --> 29:35.560
Julian is part
of the furniture here. Literally.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.920
He's eager and always horny.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.320
-Good.
-Yes, and totally irresponsible.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.520
Let's put it this way. If you walk
out of here with just a cold sore,

29:48.600 --> 29:49.880
then count yourself lucky.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.920
Because of him, half the town
has had swabs up their urethras

29:54.000 --> 29:56.040
at the Community Health Service.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.880
Are you speaking from experience?

30:02.560 --> 30:03.400
Come on.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.480
Are you expecting visitors?

30:29.240 --> 30:30.080
No.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.960
That's Floris.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.440
My partner.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.680
He contracted pneumonia.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.320
It wouldn't go away.
It just kept getting worse,

31:05.520 --> 31:07.360
and then they figured it was cancer.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.040
Well, and later on

31:13.440 --> 31:15.960
when they suspected it might be AIDS,

31:16.040 --> 31:18.040
we hoped it was just cancer.

31:20.680 --> 31:23.760
Less than two months
after that photo, he died.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.240
But I'm clean.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.680
You guys don't need to stay.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.960
-Sorry I called you here for nothing.
-No, not at all.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.960
I'm glad you called.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.640
You got here fast.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.320
-I was still awake.
-Were you at 't Rijk?

32:08.840 --> 32:13.080
Yes, we had to entertain
a business associate.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.320
Poor you.

32:21.120 --> 32:21.960
Hey.

32:24.800 --> 32:25.640
Well done.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.440
Hey.

32:30.440 --> 32:35.280
-Sorry, is the Ferrari yours?
-Yes, all 380bhp of it. Want to buy it?

32:35.360 --> 32:38.120
Please, can you move it?
It's blocking the entrance.

32:39.200 --> 32:42.520
Can you take Natas home?
There's no need for you to stay.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.760
Are you sure? It's no trouble at all.

32:44.840 --> 32:45.720
We'll be alright.

32:46.840 --> 32:47.680
Okay.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.600
Hey, Django.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.760
Are you sure? Okay. Call me.

33:05.040 --> 33:05.880
Want to drive?

33:06.800 --> 33:07.880
-Really?
-Yes.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.440
Okay, hit it.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.400
Do you know what?

33:22.640 --> 33:23.480
It feels

33:25.320 --> 33:27.600
like losing if I give in.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.760
What have you got to lose?

33:34.320 --> 33:35.160
Everything.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.680
My marriage.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.440
My family.

33:43.560 --> 33:44.720
Everything I know.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.400
-The way people see me.
-But there's also something to gain.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.480
What?

33:53.560 --> 33:55.800
Well, something you keep ignoring.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.120
Your greatest good.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.560
-My greatest good?
-Yes.

34:03.720 --> 34:04.880
What's that?

34:05.960 --> 34:06.800
Me.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.440
Well, not me. But you. Your me.

34:11.360 --> 34:12.200
Yourself.

34:16.560 --> 34:19.040
You only see yourself
through other people's eyes.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.240
And you keep conforming to that.

34:23.840 --> 34:28.040
You can keep that up for a long time.
Some people for their entire lives.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.440
You're trying to do everything right.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.360
But it's never good enough.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.240
You seem to know me very well.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.080
You're not the only one.

34:42.680 --> 34:45.480
Always playing
a different role to everyone,

34:46.640 --> 34:47.960
except it's not you.

34:54.600 --> 34:55.720
I have to go.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.160
Hey.

34:58.640 --> 34:59.480
Says who?

35:26.600 --> 35:27.840
-Ready?
-Huh?

35:28.760 --> 35:30.480
-Floor it.
-What?

35:30.560 --> 35:31.400
Floor it.

36:58.840 --> 36:59.680
Marly.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.960
What's he doing here?

37:07.680 --> 37:08.880
Thesis tutorial.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.160
-I…
-Leon.

37:27.920 --> 37:28.920
I've been thinking.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.480
-It's fine.
-No, it's not.

37:31.560 --> 37:35.840
It's not fair, how things have been going.
I've only been thinking of myself and--

37:35.920 --> 37:36.760
Leon.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.600
I did it. I left her.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.480
You did what?

37:42.320 --> 37:43.800
I just told her,

37:45.440 --> 37:46.400
"It's over."

37:46.480 --> 37:50.120
"I love someone else
and I want to start fresh with her."

37:52.400 --> 37:54.040
Marly, I love you.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.640
-Hello.
-<i>Hey, Frank.</i>

38:09.720 --> 38:12.200
Hey, John. Mission accomplished?

38:12.280 --> 38:14.840
-<i>You really need to…</i>
-Hey, calm down, John.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.760
John, what happened?

38:18.360 --> 38:20.400
-<i>I killed him.</i>
-You did what?

38:22.560 --> 38:24.520
My God, man. What…

38:26.240 --> 38:28.600
Ronnie? Ronnie, hey.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.960
-Man, what happened?
-I don't know, man.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.640
We took one of Tsjibbe's pills
just to be sure,

38:35.720 --> 38:37.360
and then he just freaked out.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.280
He started throwing punches,
he hit Ronnie square in the jaw,

38:40.360 --> 38:42.480
so I just gave him a bonk on the head.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.560
Okay. But did you…

38:52.760 --> 38:53.840
Is he still alive?

38:54.880 --> 38:56.400
I was afraid to check.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.120
Oh, shit.

39:04.760 --> 39:05.840
Oh, fuck.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.280
Is he…

39:45.880 --> 39:47.120
Mission failed.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.400
Hey, I did all I could, okay?

39:49.480 --> 39:51.520
That guy knows how to drink,
for an alcoholic.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.840
This is a shame.
It'll cost us a lot of money.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.480
Holy shit.

39:58.560 --> 39:59.520
Is that…

40:00.360 --> 40:01.640
Holy shit.

42:35.520 --> 42:36.800
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

42:38.760 --> 42:40.920
<i>That's so good.</i>

42:41.680 --> 42:43.840
<i>Ah, you make me so horny.</i>

42:47.400 --> 42:48.920
<i>Yeah, I'm coming.</i>

42:50.920 --> 42:53.400
<i>Oh, you're so lovely. Oh yeah, harder.</i>

42:53.480 --> 42:56.480
