00:01.825 --> 00:03.336
Previously on
Damages...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.766
You destroyed my
reputation. I want it back.

00:05.834 --> 00:09.439
It's a green building- perfect
headquarters for my new company.

00:09.505 --> 00:12.040
And we'll just be, you know,
a normal family again.

00:12.107 --> 00:13.275
How is Jill?

00:13.276 --> 00:14.974
You were right about
her.

00:14.975 --> 00:15.875
It's over.

00:15.876 --> 00:17.749
What did the doctor say?
We're doing great.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.457
What's next? It's time
for a 3-D ultrasound.

00:20.525 --> 00:23.798
The Tobins have totally wiped
out our financial security.

00:23.866 --> 00:24.866
We've lost everything.

00:24.867 --> 00:29.038
One of the names you requested that I
watch out for turned up: Thomas Shayes.

00:29.106 --> 00:30.811
How's Patty Hewes know
about Antigua?

00:30.812 --> 00:33.015
Your father used a
courier to help move the money.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.116
Who did he use?

00:34.117 --> 00:36.386
Your father had a daughter
with Danielle Marchetti.

00:36.454 --> 00:37.489
Am I in trouble?

00:37.490 --> 00:39.157
Not if you keep
telling the truth.

00:39.158 --> 00:42.328
I don't think Tessa Marchetti is
aware of what she's actually doing.

00:42.395 --> 00:44.062
...using the third
form to move money.

00:44.063 --> 00:46.932
I thought you should know the
actual cause of your father's death.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.834
I was the one who found
his body.

00:48.835 --> 00:49.668
There were no chemicals.

00:49.669 --> 00:51.503
But that doesn't
explain Danielle Marchetti.

00:51.504 --> 00:54.006
She also died from a potassium
overdose.

00:54.073 --> 00:57.408
I think Carol Tobin may have
killed Danielle Marchetti.

01:50.312 --> 01:55.285
You used to work for
Patty Hewes, isn't that right?

01:57.688 --> 02:01.291
Did you know that she was in
a... a car accident?

02:01.359 --> 02:03.794
No. Is she okay?

02:03.862 --> 02:05.963
Yeah, she's fine.

02:06.031 --> 02:09.335
I mean, it's lucky, because it
was quite violent.

02:09.402 --> 02:10.970
My God.
What happened?

02:10.971 --> 02:12.838
Uh, we're-we're not,
we're not sure, actually.

02:12.839 --> 02:16.141
Uh... the strange thing, uh, is

02:16.209 --> 02:18.477
that the driver of the car that

02:18.545 --> 02:23.150
hit her just disappeared.

02:23.217 --> 02:25.052
What's stranger, uh, is that

02:25.053 --> 02:28.390
the... the car

02:28.458 --> 02:31.226
that-that hit Ms. Hewes was

02:31.294 --> 02:34.197
registered to Thomas Shayes.

02:36.066 --> 02:38.501
Yeah, it-it stumped me, too.

02:38.569 --> 02:41.838
I, uh... so I thought maybe, um,

02:41.906 --> 02:46.176
maybe you could help.

02:46.244 --> 02:49.346
You're a lawyer, um...

02:49.413 --> 02:51.815
You're good at puzzles, right?

02:57.254 --> 03:03.695
So, I thought m-maybe, you know, we could
figure this out, you know, together...

Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

03:51.366 --> 03:52.566
Wind.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.468
That's why we're here tonight,

03:54.536 --> 03:56.804
to talk about wind.

03:56.872 --> 04:01.609
Several years ago, when I left the
private sector, I had a kind of epiphany.

04:01.677 --> 04:02.844
It struck me...

04:02.845 --> 04:10.320
What is the point of doing
anything, unless you're doing good?

04:10.387 --> 04:12.287
So simple.

04:12.323 --> 04:13.623
So profound.

04:13.624 --> 04:18.362
What is the point of doing
anything, unless you're doing good?

04:18.430 --> 04:19.930
Hear, hear!

04:19.930 --> 04:21.265
Thank you, Archie.

04:21.266 --> 04:23.167
I appreciate the enthusiasm.

04:23.235 --> 04:25.135
Maybe not your tie, but

04:25.203 --> 04:27.337
definitely the enthusiasm.

04:27.405 --> 04:29.206
So, I created the Whirlwind

04:29.207 --> 04:32.175
Initiative to spread the gospel
of wind power.

04:32.242 --> 04:34.176
It is time for this country to

04:34.244 --> 04:35.811
invest in a good, clean,

04:35.812 --> 04:39.347
homegrown energy alternative.

04:42.518 --> 04:45.153
To that end, I want to thank
a bunch of people who have

04:45.154 --> 04:47.789
made very generous contributions
to this organization.

04:47.857 --> 04:49.458
And I want to shake each one

04:49.459 --> 04:51.160
of your hands individually, and

04:51.161 --> 04:52.261
I promise I will.

04:52.262 --> 04:53.863
But first, there's somebody

04:53.864 --> 04:56.232
here tonight that I think merits

04:56.300 --> 05:00.069
special attention: Terry Brooke,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:01.638 --> 05:04.006
Now, we all know Terry from
Hollywood.

05:04.074 --> 05:05.708
You know, he's been in some of

05:05.709 --> 05:07.576
the biggest comedies in the past

05:07.577 --> 05:11.747
decade, but his commitment to
the Whirlwind Initiative is no

05:11.815 --> 05:13.716
laughing matter.

05:13.784 --> 05:15.284
He has taken time off tonight

05:15.285 --> 05:17.120
to support our cause and to

05:17.121 --> 05:19.656
effect a positive, global

05:19.723 --> 05:21.657
change.

05:21.725 --> 05:24.493
Thank you, Arthur.
Thank you, Terry.

05:24.561 --> 05:26.461
I salute you.

05:30.234 --> 05:33.036
Here are account statements
from my bank in Antigua.

05:33.103 --> 05:34.604
I got you everything in my name.

05:34.605 --> 05:36.205
That's what you wanted, right?

05:36.206 --> 05:38.007
There are only two
accounts?

05:38.008 --> 05:40.075
Checking and savings,
like I told you.

05:40.143 --> 05:41.877
And there's not much in there.

05:41.878 --> 05:44.046
Just your salary from
the airline?

05:44.114 --> 05:46.215
Yes.

05:46.283 --> 05:49.886
I don't see how this could have
anything to do with the Tobins' money.

05:49.953 --> 05:51.853
But I'll do whatever
I can to help.

05:51.856 --> 05:53.590
We appreciate your
cooperation, Tessa.

05:53.591 --> 05:54.424
Thank you.

05:54.425 --> 05:55.926
Yeah, thank you.

05:55.927 --> 05:58.062
Actually, I have

05:58.129 --> 06:00.464
one more question.

06:00.532 --> 06:03.233
Where did you spend last
Thanksgiving?

06:03.301 --> 06:05.735
Upstate with a friend
and her family. Why?

06:05.803 --> 06:08.638
You didn't celebrate
with your mother?

06:08.706 --> 06:10.807
No.

06:10.874 --> 06:13.242
Why not?

06:13.310 --> 06:17.079
We got in a fight.
It was stupid.

06:17.147 --> 06:22.985
It was her last Thanksgiving,
and she spent it alone.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.053
All right, Tessa.

06:24.054 --> 06:27.823
Thank you.

06:29.727 --> 06:32.129
What does Patty
Hewes know?

06:32.196 --> 06:35.900
She knows Tessa Marchetti
had an account in Antigua.

06:35.967 --> 06:38.503
But she'll never see what's in
the account.

06:38.570 --> 06:41.472
When I meet with her today, I'll
make sure of it.

06:41.540 --> 06:44.842
Thank you for coming
all this way.

06:44.910 --> 06:46.877
It was a pleasure
meeting you.

06:46.945 --> 06:48.845
I didn't know your father, but

06:48.847 --> 06:51.514
I had great respect for the man.

06:51.582 --> 06:54.484
Thank you, Mr. Emanuel.

06:59.456 --> 07:03.126
Patty knows the money's in
Antigua.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.529
That doesn't worry you?
She can't get to it.

07:05.596 --> 07:07.864
The banking laws are on our
side.

07:07.932 --> 07:12.203
And if she tries to get around the
laws, we have Mr. Emanuel to protect us.

07:12.271 --> 07:13.304
You trust him?

07:13.305 --> 07:16.441
He's financially
motivated.

07:16.509 --> 07:18.343
Your dad and I cut him in.

07:18.344 --> 07:20.245
Uh-huh.

07:20.313 --> 07:23.816
There's nothing to
worry about, fellas.

07:23.884 --> 07:25.718
As long as you don't get greedy

07:25.719 --> 07:27.286
and start spending the money

07:27.287 --> 07:30.656
anytime soon.

07:30.724 --> 07:32.524
There's something
that you should know.

07:32.525 --> 07:35.561
A woman from the D.A.'s

07:35.628 --> 07:37.829
office approached Joe.

07:37.896 --> 07:40.565
She didn't ask about
the money.

07:40.632 --> 07:44.935
The D.A. thinks that Danielle
Marchetti was murdered.

07:45.003 --> 07:48.005
They're looking into it.

07:48.073 --> 07:50.174
So, you should be careful.

07:50.242 --> 07:52.777
I should be careful?

07:52.845 --> 07:54.345
I'm not the one who killed her.

07:54.346 --> 07:55.880
We had nothing to do

07:55.881 --> 07:59.083
with it.

07:59.151 --> 08:02.753
Well, if you didn't
do it, who did?

08:15.933 --> 08:19.202
Something must be
terribly wrong with Carol.

08:19.270 --> 08:21.004
She's disappeared
like this before.

08:21.005 --> 08:22.205
Always finds her way home.

08:22.206 --> 08:24.641
Not always.

08:24.708 --> 08:27.377
Who is she seeing, Lenny?

08:27.444 --> 08:28.544
I don't know.

08:28.545 --> 08:30.346
She hasn't mentioned anybody.

08:30.347 --> 08:31.648
She has tragic

08:31.649 --> 08:33.582
taste in men.

08:33.650 --> 08:36.852
Where did she get that?

08:36.921 --> 08:40.590
She's probably holed up with
someone right now.

08:40.658 --> 08:41.791
Okay, let's just...

08:41.792 --> 08:43.426
let's just figure this out,

08:43.427 --> 08:44.628
okay?

08:44.629 --> 08:46.163
Would it make you feel better if

08:46.164 --> 08:48.398
I hired someone to find her?

08:48.466 --> 08:50.667
Yes.

08:50.735 --> 08:53.336
Do that, please.

08:53.404 --> 08:55.205
Okay, Marilyn?

08:55.206 --> 08:58.843
Marilyn, leave this to me.

08:58.910 --> 09:01.178
Everything's going to be fine.

09:01.246 --> 09:05.183
Thank you, Lenny.

09:05.251 --> 09:06.818
No one ever calms me down

09:06.819 --> 09:08.853
like you.

09:08.921 --> 09:10.821
Even Louis.

09:10.823 --> 09:11.656
Oh, come on.

09:11.657 --> 09:14.359
It's true.

09:14.427 --> 09:16.295
He'd say the right words,

09:16.296 --> 09:19.899
humor me...

09:19.966 --> 09:22.902
But I know that you always take

09:22.970 --> 09:26.339
my concerns to heart.

09:26.406 --> 09:29.474
It's only...

09:29.542 --> 09:33.212
'cause you let me.

09:33.279 --> 09:39.985
I can confirm that
Miss Marchetti has both a
checking and a savings account
at the Royal Antiguan Bank.

09:40.053 --> 09:43.689
We believe she's
signing documents for another
account.

09:43.757 --> 09:49.495
If she has another,
we haven't been able to find it.
And if the account was opened

09:49.563 --> 09:52.831
as an international banking
company, we may never find it.

09:52.899 --> 09:59.572
Mr. Emanuel, this is the largest
financial fraud in history.

09:59.640 --> 10:11.185
I share your frustration, and I will continue to pursue
every avenue on your behalf. But you must be patient.

10:11.253 --> 10:13.321
Well, Mr. Emanuel,

10:13.388 --> 10:30.638
thank you for coming in. Thank you.
He's never going to give us anything.

10:30.706 --> 10:32.640
No, he's not.

10:32.707 --> 10:34.241
But we may have another lead.

10:34.242 --> 10:37.177
I've been talking to Ellen.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.179
Carol Tobin's
missing. She hasn't

10:39.180 --> 10:41.114
been back to her
apartment in days.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.184
So I was hoping you guys could
pull some strings and help
locate her.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.287
Can't you do that
through the D.A.'s office?

10:46.354 --> 10:47.188
Ellen doesn't want

10:47.189 --> 10:49.190
her boss to know that we're
looking into Carol.

10:49.258 --> 10:50.158
Why not?

10:50.159 --> 10:54.595
I don't want Gates
getting in your way.

10:54.663 --> 10:58.033
Thank you.

10:58.101 --> 10:59.635
Wherever Carol is,

10:59.636 --> 11:01.536
we'll find her.

11:06.342 --> 11:08.343
Hey.

11:08.410 --> 11:10.244
Thank you for bringing me here.

11:10.245 --> 11:14.514
It's much better.
I feel safer.

11:28.034 --> 11:30.068
Michael?

11:30.136 --> 11:33.805
Ellen.

11:33.873 --> 11:34.673
Hey, there.

11:34.674 --> 11:35.507
Hey.

11:35.508 --> 11:37.776
How's, how's life
after Patty Hewes?

11:37.843 --> 11:40.445
I should ask you
the same question.

11:40.513 --> 11:43.148
Life's good.

11:43.216 --> 11:45.650
Jill Burnham, Ellen Parsons.

11:45.718 --> 11:46.485
Hi.

11:46.486 --> 11:48.487
Hi, lovely to meet
you.

11:48.555 --> 11:50.822
Ellen was my mom's
favorite associate.

11:50.890 --> 11:53.992
Ah, you must be pretty special
if you were Patty's favorite.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.328
Are you, uh, are you also
expecting?

11:56.396 --> 11:57.329
No, oh, no.

11:57.330 --> 11:58.197
Um, God, no.

11:58.198 --> 12:00.432
Just, uh, I was getting a
present for my niece.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.434
Aw, that's nice.

12:02.501 --> 12:04.736
And you two are...?

12:04.803 --> 12:07.038
Having a baby, yeah.

12:07.105 --> 12:09.940
Wow, that's- you're
going to be a father?

12:10.007 --> 12:12.442
Sure looks like
that.

12:12.510 --> 12:15.145
That's... wow,
that's great.

12:15.213 --> 12:17.647
We're excited, yeah.

12:17.715 --> 12:19.382
Yeah.

12:19.383 --> 12:21.150
Hey, listen, um, I'm

12:21.151 --> 12:23.419
having an art show coming up.

12:23.487 --> 12:25.088
Maybe you could stop by.

12:25.089 --> 12:27.357
Oh... okay.

12:27.425 --> 12:30.360
Great. Thank you.

12:30.428 --> 12:32.229
Well, it was good
running into you.

12:32.230 --> 12:33.597
Yeah. You, too.

12:33.598 --> 12:35.933
Nice to meet you.
And, uh, take care.

12:36.001 --> 12:36.767
You, too.

12:36.768 --> 12:37.435
Bye.

12:37.436 --> 12:40.371
Bye.

12:40.439 --> 12:44.008
All right, so is she going to
tell your mother that I'm pregnant?

12:44.076 --> 12:47.210
Oh, I don't think they
speak to each other anymore.

12:47.278 --> 12:52.282
Ellen's just another
person my mom pushed away.

12:54.552 --> 12:56.452
We've been
keeping tabs on Joe Tobin.

12:56.488 --> 12:59.523
He hasn't been drinking and he's
been attending meetings
regularly.

12:59.591 --> 13:02.092
I have, uh,

13:02.160 --> 13:03.728
something else for you.

13:03.729 --> 13:06.130
Uh, it concerns Joe's sister,

13:06.198 --> 13:08.499
Carol.

13:08.567 --> 13:11.836
We can't find her.

13:11.904 --> 13:14.973
Obviously, her mother is very
concerned.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.541
I understand.

13:16.542 --> 13:17.976
Is there a man in her life?

13:17.977 --> 13:21.196
Well, she's had a bad
history in that respect.

13:21.197 --> 13:24.415
You know, shady
boyfriends, two ex-husbands.

13:24.483 --> 13:25.983
Their names are actually all

13:25.984 --> 13:27.451
there.

13:27.452 --> 13:29.787
Ones we're aware of, anyway.

13:29.855 --> 13:34.392
The fact is, you know, she could be at
a yoga retreat and didn't tell anyone.

13:34.460 --> 13:37.128
So just find her.

13:37.196 --> 13:38.229
I'll get on it

13:38.230 --> 13:40.965
straightaway.

13:43.735 --> 13:44.502
Excuse me.

13:44.503 --> 13:48.138
Hmm?

13:48.206 --> 13:50.106
I never asked.

13:50.109 --> 13:52.877
Are you married?

13:52.945 --> 13:56.682
Why do you want
to know?

13:58.685 --> 14:02.822
Right. Right.

14:02.890 --> 14:04.758
Don't answer. Thank you.

14:04.759 --> 14:09.029
I'll let you
know when we find her.

14:14.970 --> 14:19.440
Have things settled
down at all for you here?

14:19.441 --> 14:23.911
Are the paparazzi
still totally insane?

14:23.978 --> 14:28.648
It's a little bit
better, I guess.

14:28.716 --> 14:30.050
I've, I've been

14:30.051 --> 14:34.988
thinking about you a lot and...

14:35.056 --> 14:37.490
and missing you.

14:39.593 --> 14:42.595
JOE I know.

14:42.663 --> 14:43.896
You realize this

14:43.897 --> 14:47.166
time last year we were in Aspen?

14:47.234 --> 14:48.001
Aspen, yeah.

14:48.002 --> 14:51.471
Yeah.

14:51.539 --> 14:53.206
Kevin keeps asking why we're not

14:53.207 --> 14:54.374
skiing with the Hoffmans this

14:54.375 --> 14:56.076
winter.

14:56.077 --> 14:57.778
Kevin doesn't realize that the

14:57.779 --> 15:02.449
Hoffmans refuse to see us.

15:04.018 --> 15:06.286
What?

15:08.123 --> 15:09.156
I have something for

15:09.157 --> 15:11.057
you.

15:26.242 --> 15:28.377
Just...

15:40.223 --> 15:41.523
I don't understand.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.759
Where did you get this?
We have friends.

15:43.827 --> 15:45.761
They're willing to help us.
Illegally?

15:45.828 --> 15:47.863
No, I would not put you
at that risk.

15:47.931 --> 15:49.164
The money's a gift.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.065
That's okay to
accept?

15:51.067 --> 15:52.067
This is okay?

15:52.068 --> 15:55.304
Lenny says gifts are
fine.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.206
Okay?

15:57.207 --> 16:00.843
But if Patty Hewes knew! bout
it, she'd try to take it away.

16:00.911 --> 16:05.214
So don't spend it conspicuously.

16:05.282 --> 16:06.282
Meaning what?

16:06.283 --> 16:08.985
Meaning buy what you
need and buy what...

16:09.053 --> 16:12.155
Kevin wants.

16:12.223 --> 16:15.926
Baby, you don't deserve to be
living the way you are.

16:15.994 --> 16:18.429
I'll get you more whenever I
can.

16:18.497 --> 16:19.230
Joe, I...

16:19.231 --> 16:20.464
Rach, take it.

16:20.465 --> 16:21.132
Take it.

16:21.133 --> 16:25.069
It makes me feel better.

16:25.137 --> 16:26.537
First off, let me

16:26.538 --> 16:28.105
just say it's a, it's a real

16:28.106 --> 16:29.573
thrill to have you at our

16:29.574 --> 16:31.042
foundation's fund-raisers.

16:31.043 --> 16:33.110
I mean, I'm a huge fan.

16:33.178 --> 16:34.278
Oh, thanks.

16:34.279 --> 16:35.312
And, you know, not

16:35.313 --> 16:37.514
just of you as an actor, but

16:37.582 --> 16:39.550
also as a man.

16:39.618 --> 16:41.185
You coming on to me,

16:41.186 --> 16:43.086
Arthur?

16:43.088 --> 16:44.255
I'm serious.

16:44.256 --> 16:46.724
You know, my kids and I love
watching your movies.

16:46.792 --> 16:48.226
You bring us a lot of joy.

16:48.227 --> 16:50.061
Oh, I'm glad to hear

16:50.062 --> 16:50.962
that.

16:50.963 --> 16:52.130
Sit down for a

16:52.131 --> 16:53.865
second, all right?

16:53.866 --> 16:56.234
So, the word on the street is
you're a serious guy.

16:56.301 --> 16:58.202
You got your head screwed on
straight.

16:58.270 --> 16:59.003
Is that right?

16:59.004 --> 17:00.271
Thanks.

17:00.272 --> 17:01.806
I try.

17:01.807 --> 17:04.075
Yeah, it took a little while,

17:04.142 --> 17:06.176
but, uh, I finally got myself

17:06.243 --> 17:07.478
cleaned up.

17:07.479 --> 17:08.945
Well, I'm a big

17:08.946 --> 17:10.548
believer in redemption.

17:10.549 --> 17:11.816
Yeah, life is good

17:11.817 --> 17:12.817
now.

17:12.818 --> 17:14.718
That's wonderful.

17:14.753 --> 17:16.188
You know, a lot of guys your

17:16.189 --> 17:18.123
age, they- they just don't have

17:18.191 --> 17:20.559
character yet.

17:20.627 --> 17:22.261
If you don't mind, I want to run

17:22.262 --> 17:23.262
something by you.

17:23.262 --> 17:24.830
Hear your, hear your thoughts.

17:24.832 --> 17:25.897
Shoot.

17:25.898 --> 17:27.567
The work my
initiative's doing...

17:27.568 --> 17:28.234
Yeah.

17:28.236 --> 17:28.902
...is good.

17:28.903 --> 17:29.569
It's solid.

17:29.570 --> 17:30.970
You know, we're making progress,

17:30.971 --> 17:32.172
but it's-it's low impact.

17:32.173 --> 17:33.807
What we need now is to make

17:33.808 --> 17:35.308
a splash.

17:35.309 --> 17:36.376
What do you have in

17:36.377 --> 17:37.344
mind?

17:37.345 --> 17:38.178
I'm thinking

17:38.179 --> 17:39.713
about Webisodes, commercials,

17:39.714 --> 17:41.448
PSA's- a whole series of them.

17:41.449 --> 17:42.649
But if we're going to come out

17:42.650 --> 17:44.418
swinging, you know, what we need

17:44.419 --> 17:46.620
to do is have a recognizable

17:46.688 --> 17:48.055
face, you know, somebody that

17:48.056 --> 17:49.256
people relate to.

17:49.257 --> 17:51.025
You know, a personality that

17:51.026 --> 17:52.426
they trust.

17:52.427 --> 17:53.927
Oh, sounds like you'd

17:53.928 --> 17:54.594
be perfect.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.529
Me? Oh, no.

17:55.530 --> 17:57.031
God, no. Are you kidding me?

17:57.032 --> 17:58.065
No, I'm no actor. No.

17:58.066 --> 17:59.300
Hey, have you ever seen me

17:59.301 --> 17:59.967
on camera?

17:59.968 --> 18:00.968
I look like- I look like

18:00.969 --> 18:02.503
Frankenstein.

18:02.504 --> 18:03.671
So you're thinking...?

18:03.672 --> 18:05.572
You.

18:05.575 --> 18:07.409
As the face of the Whirlwind

18:07.410 --> 18:08.410
Initiative.

18:08.411 --> 18:09.878
Absolutely, man.

18:09.879 --> 18:10.846
I tell you something.

18:10.847 --> 18:12.047
No, seriously, you'd be perfect.

18:12.048 --> 18:14.149
Geez, Art, I'm

18:14.217 --> 18:15.483
flattered.

18:15.484 --> 18:18.219
I'm signed to do three pictures

18:18.287 --> 18:19.520
back-to-back-to-back.

18:19.521 --> 18:20.622
Ah, oh, wow.

18:20.623 --> 18:22.557
In good faith, I can't

18:22.625 --> 18:23.992
make the kind of commitment

18:23.993 --> 18:24.660
you're talking about.

18:24.661 --> 18:26.896
I'm sorry about that.
No, you don't
have to apologize.

18:26.963 --> 18:28.831
Are you kidding me? Thanks...
Thanks for just listening to it.

18:28.832 --> 18:30.232
Yeah, y-you get it.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.933
Hmm...

18:31.934 --> 18:36.504
Hey, that's your life
story, huh?

18:36.572 --> 18:38.306
Yeah.

18:38.307 --> 18:40.074
My Long and Windy
Road.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.043
"Win-dy."
It's "Windy."

18:42.110 --> 18:43.644
Goddamn.

18:43.645 --> 18:45.379
I told my publisher people
wouldn't get it.

18:45.380 --> 18:50.250
No, no, that's a great title. Yeah,
it's surprisingly easy to write.

18:50.318 --> 18:54.321
I justotted down everything that
led me to this point in my life.

18:54.389 --> 18:56.390
You know, my childhood, then,

18:56.457 --> 18:58.357
uh, you know, through the

18:58.359 --> 18:59.759
selfish years and right up until

18:59.760 --> 19:02.429
my environmental enlightenment,

19:02.497 --> 19:05.299
really.

19:05.366 --> 19:08.335
Hey, you know something?

19:08.402 --> 19:10.804
Give it a read, will you?

19:10.872 --> 19:12.906
Love to.

19:12.974 --> 19:15.075
Yeah, thank you.

19:15.143 --> 19:19.947
Listen, uh, Art, I, um, I'm
afraid I'm going to have to leave.

19:20.015 --> 19:22.550
I'm sure you'll find the perfect
pitchman.

19:22.618 --> 19:25.486
I'm sure I will.
Yeah.

19:31.326 --> 19:32.292
Hey, Dad!

19:32.293 --> 19:32.960
Hi.

19:32.961 --> 19:35.095
Hey, kiddo. Hey.

19:35.163 --> 19:39.099
Did you have a good time? He
ran me around like a rodeo clown.

19:39.167 --> 19:40.434
Grandma got me
ice cream.

19:40.435 --> 19:40.968
What?

19:40.969 --> 19:41.902
And 20 degrees outside?

19:41.903 --> 19:44.338
That's what he
wanted, that's what he got.
Yeah.

19:44.406 --> 19:47.775
I want to see Aunt Carol. Yeah,
well, maybe she'll drop by later.

19:47.842 --> 19:49.577
Have you heard from
her?

19:49.578 --> 19:52.546
Yeah, I called her and left a message,
but, well, she didn't call back.

19:52.614 --> 19:54.715
Can I play video
games?

19:54.782 --> 19:55.783
Yes.

19:55.784 --> 19:59.286
Racetrack, no killing.

20:01.256 --> 20:04.491
I'm afraid something's
happened to your sister.

20:04.559 --> 20:06.026
Just give it some

20:06.027 --> 20:08.863
time, Mom.

20:08.931 --> 20:10.898
I've been looking
into Carol Tobin's past.

20:10.966 --> 20:12.499
Apparently, she's run off
before.

20:12.500 --> 20:16.136
Really? Her mother filed a
missing persons report once.

20:16.204 --> 20:18.038
Interpol found Carol with her

20:18.039 --> 20:19.873
boyfriend in Barbados.

20:19.874 --> 20:21.808
So she could be
anywhere.

20:21.876 --> 20:23.410
Well, yeah, but there

20:23.411 --> 20:24.111
is good news.

20:24.112 --> 20:25.112
Every single call from

20:25.113 --> 20:26.680
Carol Tobin's cell phone has

20:26.681 --> 20:28.115
been relayed through a tower

20:28.116 --> 20:29.617
in this section of Brooklyn.

20:29.618 --> 20:30.718
We could narrow it

20:30.719 --> 20:31.819
down if we knew where she was

20:31.820 --> 20:32.653
spending money.

20:32.654 --> 20:33.721
Yeah, well, I'm still

20:33.722 --> 20:34.989
checking on ATM records and

20:34.990 --> 20:36.124
credit card statements.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.191
So I should have more

20:37.192 --> 20:38.826
information tomorrow.

20:38.827 --> 20:39.560
You heading out?

20:39.561 --> 20:40.328
Yeah, I'm going to

20:40.329 --> 20:40.995
go meet Deb.

20:40.996 --> 20:42.230
Everything okay?

20:42.231 --> 20:45.566
Yeah, it's fine.

20:45.634 --> 20:47.868
Good night.

20:52.908 --> 20:54.208
I really like your new

20:54.209 --> 20:56.343
place.

20:56.411 --> 20:58.679
I like it, too.

20:58.747 --> 21:00.181
It must be nice to be

21:00.182 --> 21:03.184
out of that hotel.

21:09.692 --> 21:10.858
So, I ran into

21:10.859 --> 21:12.827
Michael.

21:12.895 --> 21:17.364
Actually, he invited me to his

21:17.432 --> 21:21.001
art show.

21:21.069 --> 21:22.969
I guess congratulations are

21:22.971 --> 21:25.172
in order.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.107
For what?

21:27.108 --> 21:28.208
You're going to be

21:28.209 --> 21:31.345
a grandmother.

21:31.413 --> 21:35.749
Jill's really showing.

21:39.020 --> 21:40.787
Oh...

21:40.788 --> 21:43.289
I... thought that you knew.

21:43.357 --> 21:44.458
I'm really sorry.

21:44.459 --> 21:45.459
I just assumed...

21:45.460 --> 21:47.027
No.

21:47.028 --> 21:49.629
No, no, I-I knew.

21:49.697 --> 21:53.332
I just... still find it hard

21:53.400 --> 21:55.300
adjusting to the idea.

21:55.335 --> 21:56.735
Yeah, of course.

21:56.736 --> 21:58.237
That's huge, having a

21:58.238 --> 21:59.304
grandchild.

21:59.305 --> 22:01.807
Yes, it is.

22:05.745 --> 22:07.680
âª âª

22:07.747 --> 22:09.647
Thank you so much.

22:09.683 --> 22:11.817
Okay.

22:11.885 --> 22:13.986
Hey. Thank you.

22:14.054 --> 22:15.121
You're welcome.

22:15.122 --> 22:16.155
Well, it looks like

22:16.156 --> 22:16.889
you're a hit.

22:16.890 --> 22:17.557
Why?

22:17.558 --> 22:18.691
Did we actually sell anything?

22:18.692 --> 22:19.692
Yeah, I have offers

22:19.693 --> 22:22.195
on two of your pieces.

22:22.262 --> 22:26.199
Congratulations, babe.

22:26.267 --> 22:30.270
You're a professional now.

23:03.538 --> 23:05.706
I've changed my mind.

23:05.774 --> 23:08.208
Take me home.

23:28.043 --> 23:28.777
Tom.

23:28.778 --> 23:30.445
What are you doing
right now?

23:30.446 --> 23:31.813
Headed to work.
What's up?

23:31.814 --> 23:34.282
I got Carol Tobin's
credit card statements.

23:34.350 --> 23:36.184
Want to go to Brooklyn?

23:36.185 --> 23:39.087
I'll drive.

23:39.155 --> 23:40.155
Well, th-that's

23:40.156 --> 23:41.923
true, but I, I feel that it's,

23:41.924 --> 23:44.125
it's our responsibility to our

23:44.193 --> 23:45.927
children, you know, and our

23:45.928 --> 23:47.528
children's children.

23:47.529 --> 23:50.698
And ourselves, for that matter.

23:50.766 --> 23:52.499
All right. Okay.

23:52.500 --> 23:53.567
No, no- I'll go through your

23:53.568 --> 23:54.701
people from now on.

23:54.702 --> 23:55.902
Well, thanks for taking my

23:55.903 --> 23:57.570
call, Matt.

23:57.571 --> 24:01.340
All right.

24:01.408 --> 24:03.242
McConaughey said no?

24:03.243 --> 24:04.710
Yeah, afraid so.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.111
Everybody's so

24:06.112 --> 24:07.212
goddamn selfish.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.347
No, don't say

24:08.348 --> 24:09.048
that.

24:09.049 --> 24:11.117
It's not the cause, it's

24:11.184 --> 24:13.887
probably me.

24:13.954 --> 24:15.854
What do you mean?

24:15.856 --> 24:17.089
I'm still a greedy

24:17.090 --> 24:18.658
monster to a lot of people out

24:18.659 --> 24:19.626
there.

24:19.627 --> 24:21.194
My new image is going to take

24:21.195 --> 24:23.130
some getting used to.

24:23.197 --> 24:24.832
Dad, please.

24:24.833 --> 24:26.334
Your shit was Mickey Mouse

24:26.335 --> 24:27.502
compared to the Tobins.

24:27.503 --> 24:28.670
Watch your

24:28.671 --> 24:29.971
language, will you?

24:29.972 --> 24:30.938
Actually, you know something,

24:30.939 --> 24:31.906
Owen?

24:31.907 --> 24:33.208
This is a good lesson for you.

24:33.209 --> 24:34.709
Reputations die hard, don't

24:34.710 --> 24:37.179
forget that.

24:37.246 --> 24:39.448
Anyway, it may take a while, but

24:39.515 --> 24:42.150
I will do what it takes to make

24:42.218 --> 24:43.719
this work.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.521
'Cause what can you always count

24:45.522 --> 24:47.056
on a Frobisher to do?

24:47.057 --> 24:49.825
Land on our feet.

24:49.893 --> 24:50.626
You're goddamn

24:50.627 --> 24:52.194
right.

24:52.195 --> 24:53.362
Do you recognize

24:53.363 --> 24:54.197
this woman?

24:54.198 --> 24:55.064
Her credit card

24:55.065 --> 24:56.098
statement says she bought some

24:56.099 --> 24:57.233
groceries here last week.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.067
Yeah, I think

24:58.068 --> 24:59.502
I've seen her maybe a couple of

24:59.503 --> 25:00.936
times.

25:00.937 --> 25:02.204
Did you, uh, speak

25:02.205 --> 25:02.871
with her?

25:02.872 --> 25:03.872
Uh, probably just

25:03.873 --> 25:04.774
a few words at the register.

25:04.775 --> 25:05.641
Did she mention where

25:05.642 --> 25:06.208
she lives?

25:06.209 --> 25:07.009
Nah, nah, nothing

25:07.010 --> 25:07.810
like that.

25:07.811 --> 25:08.611
Well, we think

25:08.612 --> 25:10.046
she may be staying around here.

25:10.047 --> 25:11.080
We're just trying to figure out

25:11.081 --> 25:11.581
where.

25:11.582 --> 25:12.515
I'm sorry.

25:12.516 --> 25:13.216
Customers come and go.

25:13.217 --> 25:14.184
I don't normally ask too many

25:14.185 --> 25:14.684
questions.

25:14.685 --> 25:15.952
Do you have any idea

25:15.953 --> 25:16.853
what direction she came from or

25:16.854 --> 25:17.821
where she went when she left?

25:17.822 --> 25:18.588
No, I'm afraid

25:18.589 --> 25:19.256
not.

25:19.257 --> 25:20.123
I'll tell you what.

25:20.124 --> 25:21.659
If you see her again, just give

25:21.660 --> 25:24.161
me a call.

25:24.229 --> 25:25.328
Yeah. Sure thing.

25:25.329 --> 25:26.162
Thank you.

25:26.163 --> 25:28.198
Thank you.

25:28.266 --> 25:30.434
Look, Patty, like it or

25:30.501 --> 25:31.869
not, we're stuck in each other's

25:31.870 --> 25:33.037
lives now.

25:33.038 --> 25:34.671
So why don't you just try to be

25:34.672 --> 25:36.339
civil and tell me why you asked

25:36.340 --> 25:38.842
me here?

25:38.909 --> 25:40.577
About a year ago,

25:40.578 --> 25:41.711
Jill, I made a decision.

25:41.712 --> 25:43.913
It was difficult.

25:43.981 --> 25:45.649
I struggled with it.

25:45.650 --> 25:48.284
But in the end, I promised

25:48.352 --> 25:49.786
myself that I would stay out of

25:49.787 --> 25:52.188
Michael's life.

25:52.256 --> 25:53.356
Well, that must've

25:53.357 --> 25:54.891
been hard, but maybe it was

25:54.892 --> 25:55.659
for the best.

25:55.660 --> 25:59.129
I think it was.

25:59.197 --> 26:00.630
But now I'm going to break that

26:00.631 --> 26:01.631
promise.

26:01.632 --> 26:03.800
Why is that?

26:03.868 --> 26:04.734
Because you've left

26:04.735 --> 26:07.070
me no choice.

26:07.138 --> 26:09.272
I checked you out.

26:09.339 --> 26:11.239
Does Michael know you have an

26:11.275 --> 26:13.175
ex-husband and two daughters?

26:13.177 --> 26:15.678
Of course he does.

26:15.746 --> 26:17.046
Does Michael know that

26:17.047 --> 26:19.782
your ex has sole custody?

26:19.850 --> 26:21.016
Yes.

26:21.017 --> 26:22.517
Would it surprise him

26:22.518 --> 26:23.852
to learn that the state of

26:23.853 --> 26:25.921
Colorado found you an unfit

26:25.989 --> 26:27.990
mother?

26:37.268 --> 26:41.170
I care about Michael.

26:43.107 --> 26:45.475
I lieve you.

26:45.542 --> 26:47.243
And I have sympathy.

26:47.244 --> 26:48.611
So I'm not going to tell him

26:48.612 --> 26:52.882
what I know about your past.

26:52.949 --> 26:55.150
Thank you.

26:55.218 --> 26:58.887
But I want to know...

26:58.955 --> 27:01.657
how much would it take?

27:01.724 --> 27:03.624
For what?

27:03.660 --> 27:07.330
For you to walk away.

27:07.397 --> 27:09.198
A hundred thousand dollars?

27:09.199 --> 27:10.633
Don't do this.

27:10.634 --> 27:11.868
Oh, come on, Jill, you

27:11.869 --> 27:13.203
run an art gallery, and a pretty

27:13.204 --> 27:14.604
shitty one at that.

27:14.605 --> 27:16.239
Business isn't exactly booming.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.608
Good-bye, Patty.

27:17.609 --> 27:20.044
$200,000?

27:20.111 --> 27:21.412
I came here to make

27:21.413 --> 27:22.713
peace.

27:22.714 --> 27:23.614
Well, that's not

27:23.615 --> 27:24.615
going to happen, so why don't

27:24.616 --> 27:26.116
you just take a check and

27:26.117 --> 27:30.487
disappear from my son's life?

27:30.555 --> 27:32.623
Consider this the carrot.

27:32.691 --> 27:34.325
Believe me, you don't want the

27:34.326 --> 27:37.094
stick.

27:39.831 --> 27:43.600
How are you doing?

27:43.668 --> 27:45.035
You mean financially?

27:45.036 --> 27:46.403
I'm supporting my entire

27:46.404 --> 27:48.738
extended family.

27:48.806 --> 27:49.906
Trying to avoid selling every

27:49.907 --> 27:53.777
valuable possession I own.

27:53.845 --> 27:56.247
And personally?

27:58.617 --> 28:00.517
Well, things between

28:00.519 --> 28:01.987
Deb and I have been pretty

28:01.988 --> 28:03.288
shitty recently.

28:03.289 --> 28:04.456
The hardest part is managing

28:04.457 --> 28:06.124
her anxiety, it's...

28:06.125 --> 28:09.360
She's not taking it well.

28:09.428 --> 28:12.263
I'm so sorry.

28:12.330 --> 28:13.597
Turns out that losing

28:13.598 --> 28:15.065
70% of your net worth puts a

28:15.066 --> 28:16.767
strain on a marriage.

28:16.768 --> 28:19.435
I mean, who knew?

28:19.503 --> 28:21.504
I assume you still

28:21.572 --> 28:22.905
haven't told Patty that you

28:22.906 --> 28:24.206
invested with Tobin.

28:24.207 --> 28:25.040
No.

28:25.041 --> 28:26.208
She'd pull me from the case.

28:26.209 --> 28:27.577
I don't want her thinking that

28:27.578 --> 28:29.011
my emotions would affect my

28:29.012 --> 28:29.912
decision-making.

28:29.913 --> 28:30.913
I don't think

28:30.914 --> 28:31.814
that's why you're not telling

28:31.815 --> 28:32.749
her.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.250
It isn't?

28:34.251 --> 28:35.885
No, 'cause if you

28:35.886 --> 28:37.721
told her, then you might seem

28:37.722 --> 28:39.422
weak.

28:39.423 --> 28:40.557
Patty can't stand weakness in

28:40.558 --> 28:44.461
people.

28:44.529 --> 28:47.698
Maybe. Maybe...

28:47.765 --> 28:49.032
You know, you're the only one

28:49.033 --> 28:50.734
who knows her as well as I do.

28:50.735 --> 28:51.902
Why don't you come back to the

28:51.903 --> 28:54.004
firm?

28:54.072 --> 28:55.438
I can't.

28:55.439 --> 28:56.506
You're helping us,

28:56.507 --> 28:57.240
anyway.

28:57.241 --> 28:58.274
Yeah, but I need my

28:58.275 --> 28:59.976
distance.

28:59.977 --> 29:03.813
What does that mean?

29:03.881 --> 29:06.516
If I had to deal

29:06.584 --> 29:10.853
with Patty every day, I'd...

29:10.921 --> 29:13.089
lose myself.

29:19.564 --> 29:20.731
You know, she, uh,

29:20.732 --> 29:22.666
made me partner, but once,

29:22.734 --> 29:24.702
she... she told me that I'd be

29:24.770 --> 29:27.805
nothing but a right-hand man.

29:27.873 --> 29:29.273
She's just playing

29:29.274 --> 29:30.742
mind games with you.

29:30.743 --> 29:31.776
Yeah, well, she may

29:31.777 --> 29:32.910
be right.

29:32.911 --> 29:34.811
No, Tom, you don't

29:34.813 --> 29:37.315
need her.

29:37.383 --> 29:39.484
Shit.

29:39.552 --> 29:40.385
What?

29:40.386 --> 29:41.253
Why didn't I think

29:41.254 --> 29:41.920
of this sooner?

29:41.921 --> 29:42.955
Think of what?

29:42.956 --> 29:43.990
I know someone that

29:43.991 --> 29:46.792
lives around here.

29:50.431 --> 29:52.465
It's right here.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.169
Barry!

29:56.170 --> 29:57.204
You know who lives

29:57.205 --> 29:57.871
here?

29:57.872 --> 29:58.739
Yeah.

29:58.740 --> 30:01.041
Barry, it's Tom.

30:01.109 --> 30:02.309
Tom who?

30:02.310 --> 30:04.612
Tom Shayes.

30:04.680 --> 30:05.680
Tom, Tom, Tommy

30:05.681 --> 30:06.581
Shayes.

30:06.582 --> 30:09.150
Right.

30:09.218 --> 30:10.951
Who's she?

30:10.952 --> 30:11.952
This is Ellen.

30:11.953 --> 30:14.188
Hey.

30:16.925 --> 30:19.593
I don't trust her.

30:19.661 --> 30:20.694
She's, she's a

30:20.695 --> 30:23.296
friend. Okay?

30:23.364 --> 30:26.699
Have you seen this woman?

30:26.767 --> 30:27.467
No.

30:27.468 --> 30:28.702
We think she might be

30:28.703 --> 30:30.937
hiding out around here.

30:31.004 --> 30:32.605
Look, here's a hundred bucks.

30:32.606 --> 30:33.906
You want me to keep

30:33.907 --> 30:35.207
an eye out for her?

30:35.208 --> 30:36.376
That's right.

30:36.377 --> 30:37.810
If you see her, call me right

30:37.811 --> 30:38.845
away.

30:38.846 --> 30:39.879
Use that payphone around the

30:39.880 --> 30:41.113
corner and call me, all right?

30:41.114 --> 30:42.448
It's important.

30:42.449 --> 30:45.852
You got it, Tommy.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.290
Thanks, Barry.

31:00.236 --> 31:01.270
I'll do whatever I

31:01.271 --> 31:02.538
can to help you.

31:02.539 --> 31:05.408
Thank you.

31:05.475 --> 31:08.644
So, um, Patty Hewes is hit by

31:08.712 --> 31:10.246
a car registered to Thomas

31:10.247 --> 31:13.149
Shayes.

31:13.217 --> 31:15.251
The driver of the car flees

31:15.319 --> 31:17.853
the scene.

31:17.921 --> 31:19.989
My partner and I go to the

31:20.057 --> 31:24.961
address the car's registered to.

31:25.029 --> 31:26.529
Then we find Thomas Shayes dead

31:26.530 --> 31:30.266
in a Dumpster.

31:30.334 --> 31:31.534
The same Dumpster where we

31:31.535 --> 31:36.438
found your bag.

31:39.409 --> 31:40.542
That is hard to

31:40.543 --> 31:42.544
explain.

31:42.611 --> 31:46.615
Yeah.

31:48.851 --> 31:49.951
You know, Detective,

31:49.952 --> 31:51.820
I... I don't think I'm in the

31:51.821 --> 31:53.555
right state of mind to help you

31:53.556 --> 31:54.389
right now.

31:54.390 --> 31:55.424
Yeah, sure.

31:55.425 --> 31:56.191
Sure, I understand.

31:56.192 --> 31:59.261
This is, you know...

32:00.764 --> 32:03.432
Yeah.

32:05.601 --> 32:07.501
Oh, there's one-one more thing.

32:07.537 --> 32:09.905
The, um, the homeless man who

32:09.972 --> 32:13.242
found your bag, uh, he seems to

32:13.310 --> 32:14.543
think that you and Tom Shayes

32:14.544 --> 32:15.577
were in some kind of

32:15.578 --> 32:19.247
relationship.

32:22.518 --> 32:24.286
Was there something romantic

32:24.287 --> 32:27.555
going on between the two of you?

32:32.327 --> 32:33.694
Tom and I were

32:33.695 --> 32:37.364
starting a law firm together.

32:51.185 --> 32:53.520
I read it.

32:57.859 --> 33:01.795
Arthur, I loved it.

33:01.863 --> 33:02.863
Yeah?

33:02.864 --> 33:03.831
Jesus Christ, the

33:03.832 --> 33:04.932
shit you've been through.

33:04.933 --> 33:08.602
It's just fantastic.

33:08.670 --> 33:09.670
Well, thank you.

33:09.671 --> 33:10.871
I'll tell you the

33:10.872 --> 33:12.105
truth, I was in Italy during

33:12.106 --> 33:13.973
your trial, so I missed it.

33:13.974 --> 33:16.242
But this is...

33:16.310 --> 33:18.578
it's remarkable.

33:18.646 --> 33:19.812
I- I really

33:19.813 --> 33:20.980
appreciate you reading that.

33:20.981 --> 33:22.314
Thank you, Terry.

33:22.315 --> 33:23.549
I want to be in

33:23.550 --> 33:25.685
business with you.

33:25.753 --> 33:28.822
Let me option this.

33:28.890 --> 33:32.492
I want the rights to your story.

33:32.560 --> 33:35.829
Um...

33:35.897 --> 33:37.797
You know, Terry, I-I don't...

33:37.833 --> 33:39.400
I don't think people want to see

33:39.401 --> 33:41.502
a movie about my life.

33:41.570 --> 33:43.704
Your rise, your fall,

33:43.772 --> 33:47.507
the rebuilding.

33:47.575 --> 33:49.175
It's an American epic.

33:49.176 --> 33:50.143
You're kidding

33:50.144 --> 33:51.277
me, right?

33:51.278 --> 33:53.012
Arthur, you get the

33:53.013 --> 33:54.380
right director and the right

33:54.381 --> 33:55.647
writer...

33:55.648 --> 33:56.582
This is powerful,

33:56.583 --> 33:57.316
powerful stuff.

33:57.317 --> 33:58.383
Yeah, I don't,

33:58.384 --> 33:59.151
I don't know.

33:59.152 --> 33:59.819
Thank you.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.820
Yes.

34:03.557 --> 34:07.193
And I want to play you.

34:11.431 --> 34:12.766
I'm flattered,

34:12.766 --> 34:15.469
obviously, but...

34:15.536 --> 34:17.538
I really don't think this is

34:17.606 --> 34:18.739
a very good idea.

34:18.741 --> 34:20.241
You give me the

34:20.242 --> 34:23.177
rights to your book...

34:23.245 --> 34:25.045
you've got yourself a pitchman

34:25.047 --> 34:27.715
for your foundation.

34:35.089 --> 34:36.222
You would do

34:36.223 --> 34:37.489
the commercials...

34:37.491 --> 34:39.859
and the Webisodes, the PSA's?

34:39.927 --> 34:43.297
As many as you want.

34:43.364 --> 34:46.500
What do you say?

34:46.568 --> 34:47.702
Well, I suppose if

34:47.703 --> 34:50.004
we can both help each other out.

34:50.072 --> 34:53.141
We absolutely can.

34:53.208 --> 34:55.377
I have to say

34:55.444 --> 34:59.414
I'm intrigued...

34:59.482 --> 35:01.349
Boy!

35:01.350 --> 35:03.918
Yeah!

35:03.986 --> 35:05.920
Louis Tobin's boots,

35:05.988 --> 35:07.855
Danielle Marchetti's phone.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.256
Where did you get

35:09.257 --> 35:09.757
those?

35:09.758 --> 35:10.624
At some point,

35:10.625 --> 35:12.092
someone threw the boots and the

35:12.093 --> 35:13.026
phone into a Dumpster,

35:13.027 --> 35:13.960
and Barry found them.

35:13.961 --> 35:14.961
The homeless guy?

35:14.962 --> 35:16.730
So that's how you know him?

35:16.731 --> 35:18.465
Why would someone throw this

35:18.466 --> 35:19.633
stuff away?

35:19.634 --> 35:21.034
Tobin's trying to

35:21.035 --> 35:24.638
cover up Thanksgiving.

35:26.641 --> 35:28.642
Your guy found her.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.311
She all right?

35:30.312 --> 35:31.312
He said she

35:31.313 --> 35:32.980
looked a little run down, but

35:32.981 --> 35:34.515
besides that, she seemed fine.

35:34.516 --> 35:36.083
Here's the address where she's

35:36.084 --> 35:38.118
been staying.

35:40.655 --> 35:42.156
You sure this is

35:42.157 --> 35:43.090
the place?

35:43.091 --> 35:46.326
Yes. Why?

35:50.632 --> 35:52.266
Michael, are you sure

35:52.267 --> 35:54.301
you want this?

35:54.368 --> 35:55.568
Want what?

35:55.569 --> 35:58.104
Me, the baby,

35:58.172 --> 35:58.972
all of it.

35:58.973 --> 36:00.240
You have your whole life

36:00.241 --> 36:00.973
ahead of you.

36:00.974 --> 36:01.908
We've already talked

36:01.909 --> 36:02.642
about this.

36:02.643 --> 36:05.211
You could be at college

36:05.279 --> 36:06.813
with your friends, going to

36:06.814 --> 36:08.215
parties and thinking

36:08.216 --> 36:09.450
about yourself.

36:09.451 --> 36:10.651
I'm not interested

36:10.652 --> 36:12.787
in that.

36:12.855 --> 36:14.122
I just, I just don't

36:14.123 --> 36:16.090
want to saddle you with

36:16.158 --> 36:17.058
anything.

36:17.059 --> 36:18.593
I want you to know that you

36:18.594 --> 36:21.296
can walk away and I'll be okay.

36:21.364 --> 36:22.697
Where is this coming

36:22.698 --> 36:24.098
from all of a sudden?

36:24.099 --> 36:27.601
Nowhere.

36:27.669 --> 36:29.971
Shit. Ellen told my

36:30.039 --> 36:31.772
mom she saw us, didn't she?

36:31.773 --> 36:32.473
What?

36:32.474 --> 36:33.441
Did my mother

36:33.442 --> 36:34.008
call you?

36:34.009 --> 36:35.276
Did you talk to her?

36:35.277 --> 36:36.211
Of course not.

36:36.212 --> 36:39.047
I would have told you that.

36:41.217 --> 36:43.151
I just want to know that you're

36:43.219 --> 36:46.288
sure, that's all.

36:46.356 --> 36:47.989
I'm really glad that you're in

36:47.990 --> 36:50.091
this with me.

37:19.958 --> 37:21.892
Lenny!

37:21.960 --> 37:23.327
Are you okay?

37:23.328 --> 37:26.163
Hey.

37:26.231 --> 37:28.165
She's fine.

37:28.233 --> 37:29.867
Carol, let me speak with

37:29.868 --> 37:31.802
Lenny alone, okay?

37:39.678 --> 37:40.779
These apartments

37:40.780 --> 37:42.114
are in my name, Joe.

37:42.115 --> 37:43.215
I am the landlord here.

37:43.216 --> 37:44.449
You should have told me.

37:44.450 --> 37:46.051
How'd you find out she

37:46.052 --> 37:46.785
was here?

37:46.786 --> 37:47.853
Your mother was

37:47.854 --> 37:48.520
concerned.

37:48.521 --> 37:49.521
I hired someone.

37:49.522 --> 37:51.422
You hired someone?

37:51.458 --> 37:52.591
Why are you

37:52.592 --> 37:55.595
hiding her?

37:55.663 --> 37:56.963
Because Zedeck didn't

37:56.964 --> 37:58.664
kill Danielle.

37:58.665 --> 38:01.534
What do you mean?

38:05.639 --> 38:07.940
What did Danielle say
to the D.A.?

38:08.008 --> 38:08.908
Nothing.

38:08.909 --> 38:10.342
She pled the Fifth.

38:10.343 --> 38:10.943
What?!

38:10.944 --> 38:13.212
She knows you had nothing to
do with the fraud.

38:13.279 --> 38:14.579
Why didn't she just say that?

38:14.580 --> 38:15.580
I don't know.

38:15.581 --> 38:16.448
After everything Daddy

38:16.449 --> 38:17.982
did for her, after all that shit

38:17.983 --> 38:19.350
she dragged our family into.

38:19.351 --> 38:21.953
What can we do about it?

38:33.134 --> 38:35.302
Why do you still have that?

38:35.370 --> 38:37.171
I don't know. I was...

38:37.172 --> 38:38.639
Look, Carol, I am

38:38.640 --> 38:40.541
really sorry for your family...

38:40.609 --> 38:44.678
but I'm gonna get your coat.

38:55.057 --> 38:56.957
Jesus Christ.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.693
I didn't want the D.A.

38:58.694 --> 38:59.694
to get to Carol, so I put her

38:59.695 --> 39:02.030
here.

39:09.939 --> 39:11.407
Tom Shayes.

39:11.408 --> 39:12.241
Tommy.

39:12.242 --> 39:13.742
Barry, did you

39:13.743 --> 39:14.577
find her?

39:14.578 --> 39:16.679
No, but he came back.

39:16.747 --> 39:18.581
Who came back?

39:18.582 --> 39:21.517
The guy who threw away the
stuff I found in the Dumpster.

39:21.585 --> 39:23.219
You mean the
cell phone?

39:23.220 --> 39:25.254
And the boots.
Yeah, he's back.

39:25.322 --> 39:27.556
You sure it's the guy
who threw the stuff away?

39:27.624 --> 39:28.790
Shit, yeah.

39:28.791 --> 39:31.226
How do you know?

39:31.293 --> 39:32.660
I saw him clear as

39:32.661 --> 39:34.662
day.

39:54.150 --> 39:56.418
Thanks, Barry.

40:03.993 --> 40:06.094
Patty, I can't talk
right now.

40:06.162 --> 40:07.195
Where are you?

40:07.196 --> 40:10.697
Goddamn it! Tell
me what's going on.

40:10.765 --> 40:12.665
Tom? Tom?!

40:13.668 --> 40:16.870
Patty, I gotta go.

40:23.512 --> 40:25.913
Let's do this fast.

40:27.883 --> 40:29.149
It's all here?

40:29.150 --> 40:30.618
All of it.

40:30.619 --> 40:31.952
Good.

40:31.953 --> 40:35.189
I'm a man
of my word.
