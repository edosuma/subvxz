00:00.625 --> 00:02.127
-Previously on The Fosters...
-Watch out!

00:04.212 --> 00:05.672
-Hey!
-Officer:
She's under arrest,

00:05.714 --> 00:07.465
vehicular assault
and felony hit and run.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.341
Man: Prior to
a jurisdictional hearing,

00:08.341 --> 00:11.052
-we'd like to call
a fitness hearing.
-What's a fitness hearing?

00:11.094 --> 00:12.804
It means they want
to try you as an adult.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.389
You've been invited
to the party tonight.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.807
I'm not interested.

00:15.849 --> 00:16.933
What, you don't get high?

00:17.600 --> 00:20.395
-I'm not supposed to see you.
-I won't tell if you won't.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.980
How is Nick texting you
from juvie?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.523
You could have told me
the truth.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.942
Mariana:
I love you so much,
I can't lose you again.

00:30.947 --> 00:31.781
Thanks.

00:32.531 --> 00:35.744
Doctor:
We're gonna put Jesus
into a medically induced coma.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.788
Lena: Even if everything
goes perfectly, there still
could be consequences.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.791
Learning disabilities, having
to learn to walk and talk again.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.585
Hey, baby! Hey!

00:44.753 --> 00:46.713
You've committed
academic fraud!

00:46.755 --> 00:48.256
We need to talk
about Brandon.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.924
You're not going
to Juilliard.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.009
(crying)

00:57.348 --> 00:58.975
Brandon:
Mom?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.770
Can...

01:03.646 --> 01:05.690
(sighs) Will you say something?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.192
Please?

01:08.151 --> 01:09.861
Have you told your father yet?

01:10.820 --> 01:12.072
No.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.790
Mom?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.878
Mom, what are you--
what are you doing with--
Mom?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.797
Where are you--
where are you going?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.010
-(Stef groans)
-(banging continues)

01:34.052 --> 01:35.845
Mom, what are you doing?

01:35.887 --> 01:36.971
Yeah, what's going on?

01:37.013 --> 01:38.515
"What's going on?"

01:38.556 --> 01:39.724
That's exactly what I would
like to know.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.184
What the hell
is going on around here?

01:41.226 --> 01:43.520
You're getting high,
you're stealing Jesus's pills,

01:43.561 --> 01:45.021
and he cheated
on the S.A.T.,

01:45.063 --> 01:45.897
so he is now unaccepted
at Juilliard.

01:45.897 --> 01:49.692
-Oh, my--
-There are far too many secrets
going on around here,

01:49.734 --> 01:50.944
so the doors are coming off.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.489
Wait, d-- does Mama know
that you're doing this?

01:54.531 --> 01:56.116
Don't need her permission.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.909
-Yeah, well I'm gonna text her.
-Go right ahead.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.286
You know what? I don't
have the time for this. Here.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.746
All of the bedroom doors
come off.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.373
-Even yours?
-No!

02:03.414 --> 02:04.541
Not mine.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.667
Where do we put them?

02:05.708 --> 02:07.418
In the garage!
I don't care.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.169
-Okay.
-Going to the hospital.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.505
Can I come?

02:10.547 --> 02:11.464
(sighs)

02:11.464 --> 02:17.095
No, sweetheart, because Jesus--
he's just-- he's not up
for visitors yet.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.764
Well, what about Callie?
When can we see her?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.142
Only parents can see her
right now, Jude.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.686
And when do we get
the doors back?

02:24.727 --> 02:26.146
When we can trust you again.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.439
This is like, cruel
and unusual punishment.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.817
Tell me about it.
Sometimes, that's how
I feel about parenting.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.619
(sighs)

02:43.288 --> 02:44.581
Hey.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.374
Sofia told me
Callie's back in juvie.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.750
How did Sofia know that--

02:47.792 --> 02:49.502
Mariana told her.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.796
Were you ever planning
to let me know?

02:53.715 --> 02:55.508

a kid in the hospital

-Hey, Robert.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.982
Let's-- Can we take this
outside, please?

03:56.569 --> 03:58.029
(sighs)

03:58.071 --> 04:00.448
Frankly, I did not want
to announce to the whole world

04:00.490 --> 04:01.866
that Callie is in juvie.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.534
Yeah, well, I'm not
the world, I'm her father.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.703
Birth... father.
We're aware.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.498
However, Lena and I
are her parents are
we are handling this.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.249
-Are you?
-Yes.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.250
Exactly what kind
of job are you
doing as parents?

04:10.291 --> 04:14.629
This is the second time
that Callie has been in juvie
since she's been with you.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.547
You don't have all of
the details, all right?

04:16.589 --> 04:19.634
And you really want to play
a game of who's a better parent?

04:19.676 --> 04:20.760
(scoffs)

04:22.220 --> 04:24.430
(sighs) All right, at least
let me call my lawyer.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.181
I'll pay for all the fees.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.934
We have a lawyer,
thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

04:27.976 --> 04:28.977
What firm is he with?

04:30.186 --> 04:31.437
She is a public defender.

04:31.479 --> 04:33.064
-You're not serious?
-Yes, I trust her.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.816
I've known her for years.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.985
She knows the juvenile system
inside and out.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.988
She has a great relationship
with the D.A. and the judge.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.156
And the last thing
that Callie needs right now

04:42.198 --> 04:45.660
is your arrogant,
hot-shot lawyer showing up
and pissing everybody off.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.081
I'm sorry. I don't...

04:52.125 --> 04:54.419
I understand that you're
upset, okay?

04:54.460 --> 04:56.879
We are all upset, trust me.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.548
Yeah.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.467
From now on, we will do
our best to keep you...

05:01.509 --> 05:02.969
informed, okay?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.846
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

05:04.887 --> 05:05.680
-I would appreciate that.
-No problem.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.809
If you don't mind,
I would really like
to get to the hospital.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.271
Yeah.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.318
(security shouts indistinctly)

05:20.528 --> 05:21.904
Hey.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.034
Missed you last night.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.453
What, you don't want
to party with me?

05:28.494 --> 05:30.413
No, it's not personal.
I just--

05:30.455 --> 05:31.914
Come on. Hang out.

05:32.874 --> 05:33.624
You seem cool.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.586
You're gonna be in here
for awhile, why not
have some fun?

05:42.633 --> 05:43.926
Okay. If you change your mind...

05:47.889 --> 05:49.432
Keep it moving.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.689
AJ, I hate to interrupt
your playdate, but you're
gonna be late for school.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.567
-Here.
-(speaking baby-talk)

05:59.609 --> 06:01.694
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.905
-Mwah! I love you.
-(laughs)

06:03.946 --> 06:05.823
-All righty.
-Mm, I got her.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.700
-Bye, AJ.
-AJ: Bye-bye.

06:07.742 --> 06:08.993
Oh, you are so sweet.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.829
-She makes it easy.
-Ana: Mm-hmm.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.748
-(baby coughs)
-Ana: Oh, no. Oh, no.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.335
Oh, hey, and don't forget,
you're gonna get me
on that list,

06:17.377 --> 06:18.920
so I can go see Callie.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.421
Yeah, I'll do my best.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.506
Thanks.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.632
Have a good day.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.175
-(cries)
-Sweet, sweet, sweet.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.762
So you're not gonna tell him
what's going on?

06:27.804 --> 06:30.181
I don't want to freak him out
more than he already is.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.392
So what happens if
they try Callie as an adult?

06:32.433 --> 06:34.060
Well, if they find her guilty...

06:34.102 --> 06:35.436
prison.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.771
Oh, my god!

06:36.813 --> 06:38.981
-Yeah.
-Poor Stef and Lena.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.734
They must be so stressed out
between Callie and Jesus.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.822
Do you think they would
let me see him?

06:45.863 --> 06:48.324
I mean, I don't want
to overstep, but...

06:48.366 --> 06:50.701
Yeah, let me just ask Stef.

That fool thinks
she's with him?

08:24.462 --> 08:26.464
He bags every girl he can.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.801
And watch out,
his drugs are nasty.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.013
I mean, one girl he partied with
went to the infirmary...

08:34.054 --> 08:35.890
and never came back.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.647
Well, why didn't
you tell me?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.023
Because he wanted to,

08:44.065 --> 08:45.608
and there hasn't exactly
been a great time.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.860
I can't believe
Brandon would be
so stupid.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.695
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.279
You just took the doors off?

08:50.321 --> 08:53.074
I'm tired
of all of these secrets, Lena.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.575
Honey, what about
their privacy?

08:54.617 --> 08:56.327
They don't deserve
any privacy.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.663
And to top it all off,
I'm coming down
the stairs to leave

08:58.704 --> 09:00.456
and who's standing
at the front door but Robert.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.833
-Somehow, he heard
about Callie.
-Oh, god. How was he?

09:02.875 --> 09:06.587
Mad. But I think somehow,
I managed to talk him
off the ledge.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.880
Did you tell him about
the fitness hearing?

09:07.922 --> 09:10.383
No. I didn't.
I'm sure I should have.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.010
-But the kids were right there,
I'm not gonna get into--
-Doctor: Hi there.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.054
-Hi.
-Good to see you again.

09:15.096 --> 09:15.721
-Good to see you again.
-Yeah.

09:15.763 --> 09:19.684
So, um... before we go in,
I want to prepare you.

09:19.725 --> 09:23.854
There are so many unknowns
about traumatic brain injuries,

09:23.896 --> 09:25.523
so you have to be patient.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.441
Manage your expectations.

09:27.483 --> 09:30.903
There can be significant ups
and unpredictable downs.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.739
The milestones reached
are not always milestones held.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.032
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.409
-Can we-- Can we see him?
-Of course.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.577
Right.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.954
Um, just stay positive,
bolster him.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.081
Recovery can be frustrating
for the patient,

09:42.123 --> 09:43.874
so, uh, he's gonna
need encouragement.

09:43.916 --> 09:44.959
-Okay.
-Just make sure that

09:45.001 --> 09:50.548
the only thing he sees in
your eyes is absolute confidence
that he's gonna get better.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.174
-Yeah.
-Great, we can do that.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.718
-Shall we?
-Thank you.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.806
Hey, buddy.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.017
Hey. Hey, bud.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.185
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi, love.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.651
I'm Dr. Danville.
I'm your neurologist.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.236
Can you tell us your name?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.452
(mumbles)

10:19.493 --> 10:21.120
Uh...

10:22.622 --> 10:23.956
-Jesus.
-Good.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.542
Can you tell me...

10:28.169 --> 10:29.962
what this is
that I'm holding?

10:32.298 --> 10:34.216
It's... a s...

10:35.760 --> 10:38.179
screw...driver?

10:38.220 --> 10:39.847
Are you sure?

10:41.432 --> 10:44.185
Good. That's actually--
that's a positive sign.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.770
He knows the category,
that it's a tool.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.813
It's a hammer.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.690
Right?
You hammer nails.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.776
Can you say "hammer"?

10:51.817 --> 10:52.902
The...

10:55.404 --> 10:56.739
hammer.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.366
-Good.
-That's it, bud.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.326
That's it, way to do it.
Way to do it.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.370
Can you tell me

11:02.411 --> 11:03.871
what this is?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.504
Mmm...

11:11.545 --> 11:13.339
It's a brush.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.758
Doctor:
Good. Good, good.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.884
Good job.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.511
So, um...

11:21.514 --> 11:25.768
So, as you can see,
he's experiencing some...
cognitive deficits,

11:25.810 --> 11:27.228
some neurological symptoms--

11:27.269 --> 11:29.313
the hand tremor
and the leg twitching.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.607
He's gonna need
some assistance walking,

11:31.649 --> 11:32.566
at least for a little while.

11:32.566 --> 11:36.987
Just a, you know, cane
or a walker, I don't think
he needs a wheelchair.

11:38.781 --> 11:42.201
Listen, I am optimistic
about his prognosis.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.661
He's one of the lucky ones.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.830
But, I have to warn you,

11:45.871 --> 11:47.998
his full recovery
is gonna take
a long time.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.876
Okay. Well, when can
he come home?

11:52.044 --> 11:53.879
He's gonna need
round-the-clock care.

11:55.589 --> 11:59.677
Actually, the hospital
has a terrific inpatient
rehab facility

11:59.719 --> 12:02.972
that specializes in TBI.
I'm sure I can get
Jesus a room.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.851
Okay, well,
we'll talk about it then.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.936
-Thank you, appreciate it.
-Good. Okay.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.815
So, I'm gonna see you soon,

12:12.857 --> 12:14.692
but before I go...

12:14.734 --> 12:16.819
do you remember
what this is?

12:18.487 --> 12:19.905
It's a screwdriver.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.955
I'm afraid something's, like,
really wrong with Jesus.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.749
And my moms don't want
to tell us anything

12:29.790 --> 12:31.041
'cause they don't want
to freak us out.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.086
-I just really want
to see him.
-Hey.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.756
He's gonna be all right.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.012
I promise.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.555
Okay.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.015
Thanks.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.686
Hey. Uh, do you have a second?

12:50.728 --> 12:51.854
Yeah, what's up?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.731
Uh...

12:53.773 --> 12:56.942
Are you and M-- Mariana, um...

12:56.984 --> 12:58.778
having sex?

12:58.819 --> 13:00.237
-Dude.
-I know, I know.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.947
I just-- I don't, um--

13:01.989 --> 13:05.743
Is there maybe a chance
that she could be, like--

13:05.785 --> 13:07.328
Be what?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.830
Pregnant?

13:10.831 --> 13:13.709
No.
I-- I mean-- (scoffs)

13:13.751 --> 13:15.419
This is weird.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.712
Yeah, I know. I know.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.923
-I just, uh--
-Why are you asking?

13:18.964 --> 13:23.427
I saw Emma buy her
a pregnancy test.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.972
Whoa. I...

13:27.848 --> 13:29.683
I mean, I wore a condom.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.018
Yeah, this is weird, so--

13:31.060 --> 13:32.895
I don't think she can be.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.106
With me.

13:37.942 --> 13:42.863
No. Yeah, no.
Well, I'm sure I'm wrong
about this, so, uh...

13:43.531 --> 13:47.326
Just... forget everything.
Forget anything I said.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.869
Yeah.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.544
Oh, hey.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.963
I just stopped by
to pick up some papers.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.173
Is it okay if I work
from the hospital today?

14:01.215 --> 14:05.719
Stef's got a thing and we didn't
want to leave Jesus alone.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.888
Of course. Hey, I don't
want to add to your stress,

14:07.930 --> 14:09.557
but did you happen
to finish the, uh...

14:10.516 --> 14:11.976
The budget report.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.561
I am so sorry, Monte.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.104
I-- I-- (sighs)
I didn't get it done.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.773
It's fine. You can
get it to me tomorrow.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.108
(sighs)

14:20.776 --> 14:22.194
How's Jesus?

14:22.236 --> 14:25.948
He's, uh--
he's gonna be fine.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.450
And how are you?

14:28.492 --> 14:31.328
Uh... you know, we're all
just a little overwhelmed.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.705
I can imagine.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.081
Yeah.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.793
Hey, you know,
if you need to take
a leave of absence,

14:37.835 --> 14:39.712
-that's okay.
-Oh, no, no. No.
Thank you.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.338
But honestly,
we couldn't afford it.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.840
We're gonna be
out of pocket

14:42.882 --> 14:44.550
on a lot of these expenses.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.594
And we're gonna need
both incomes.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.971
Of course.
I understand.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.266
Well, if there's anything
I can do to help.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.476
(sighs) Thank you

14:54.518 --> 14:55.853
for being so supportive.

in charge of your case,

and I was able to convince them
to withdraw the petition
for the fitness hearing...

16:01.085 --> 16:06.090
if you plead guilty
to vehicular assault
and felony hit and run.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.049
What does that mean?

16:07.049 --> 16:11.178
Callie would probably have to
stay in juvenile detention
until she's 18.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.764
What? Wait,
how is this happening?

16:13.806 --> 16:14.431
-Well, let's just hear her out.
-No.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.976
I didn't do anything wrong.
It wasn't my fault.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.519
I was a passenger
in the car,

16:18.560 --> 16:20.187
I called 911,
and I went to the police.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.731
Now I'm gonna stay
in juvie until I'm 18?

16:22.773 --> 16:24.733
Callie, I am on your side.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.361
But at this point,
it's a "he said,
she said" situation.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.030
And, unfortunately
you have a record.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.283
And there aren't
any witnesses I can call
to refute Johnson's story.

16:33.325 --> 16:37.079
All right. But Callie doesn't
turn 18 for another 8 months.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.623
I mean, that's a long time
for her to sit here in juvie.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.001
But when she gets out,
her record will be expunged.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.879
Or, if you take your chances,

16:45.921 --> 16:47.881
and the judge agrees
to try you as an adult...

16:48.340 --> 16:51.176
you could be looking
at five years in prison

17:05.898 --> 17:07.401
Can we think about it?

17:07.443 --> 17:08.819
-Of course.
-Mm-hmm.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.404
The hearing's tomorrow.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.830
-There you go.
-AJ: Could you check again?

17:20.873 --> 17:23.459
My foster dad's a cop,
and he said he'd try
to get me on the list.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.085
Sorry.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.963
But she's my girl.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.690

18:28.732 --> 18:29.483
Is there really a choice?

18:29.483 --> 18:32.861

What's going on with you?

18:39.952 --> 18:40.536
Actually, I, um--

18:40.536 --> 18:43.872
I asked Ana and Isabella
to move in with me.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.666
Really?

18:45.707 --> 18:47.376

18:54.133 --> 18:55.759

you know.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.428
Yeah, so...?

18:58.470 --> 19:01.223
You're fostering AJ.
She's a convicted felon.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.977
Yeah, but technically
she's not fostering him.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.396
I don't think
that's gonna matter to CPS.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.315
Mm.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.027
Why are you
investigating a murder?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.529
He was my foster brother.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.573
Callie, you--
you're 17,

19:17.614 --> 19:20.159
you're a senior
in high school, you should be
doing normal things.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.326
Yeah,
well, I'm not normal.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.412
Come on.
That's not true.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.624
Your moms know
you were doing this?

19:27.666 --> 19:30.002

-What does that mean,
"sort of"? Yes, or no?

19:36.091 --> 19:38.510
I know it's what you wanted,
but this, this just

19:38.552 --> 19:40.304
I made a huge mistake
letting them adopt you.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.014
I never should have signed away
my parental rights.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.183
Dad, could we just
not do that right now?

19:44.224 --> 19:45.601
Please?

19:46.518 --> 19:47.811
Sorry.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.524

that I am here for you.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.735
Stef, she--

19:54.776 --> 19:57.779
she has confidence
in this public defender,

19:57.821 --> 19:59.740
but if you feel
you need another lawyer...

20:00.699 --> 20:01.950
I can help.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.037
Okay. Thanks.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.833
Oh. Almost forgot.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.171
This is, uh--
this is from
your boyfriend.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.923
He was trying to
get in here to see you.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.968

20:20.886 --> 20:22.638

Yeah, he is.

20:28.310 --> 20:28.936
(clears throat)

20:28.977 --> 20:33.357
So my lawyer thinks
that I should say I'm guilty

20:33.398 --> 20:36.318
and just stay in juvie
until I'm 18.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.489
But if I win
the fitness hearing,

20:40.530 --> 20:43.742
then I'd get a chance
to tell my side of the story
to the judge

20:43.784 --> 20:46.245
and then all of the charges
could be dismissed.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.290

What? Wait, why? Why?

21:43.719 --> 21:44.803
Why?

21:46.471 --> 21:47.764
Why?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.641
Why?

21:49.683 --> 21:51.351
Mariana, honey.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.688
Hey, bud.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.982
Everything's fine, bud.
Everything's fine.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.775
You're doing good.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.902
Why don't we let
Jesus get some sleep, huh?

22:00.944 --> 22:02.904
Get some sleep, baby.
All right?

22:02.946 --> 22:04.656
Get some sleep.

22:04.698 --> 22:08.577
♪ Honey, we're both going down,
but we're keeping quiet ♪

22:10.829 --> 22:13.040
♪ If I go ♪

22:15.792 --> 22:17.336
Listen to me.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.921
I know you are afraid.

22:19.963 --> 22:24.426
Okay, we're all afraid,
but you cannot cry
in front of Jesus.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.136
It scares him, love.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.513
We got to put on
brave faces.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.931
You hear me?

22:30.766 --> 22:32.309
We all do, for him.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.729
And you have got
to stop disobeying us.

22:35.771 --> 22:36.938
Okay.

22:36.980 --> 22:37.856
No, it's not okay.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.901
When are you gonna
understand that you can't do
whatever you want to do

22:40.942 --> 22:42.277
whenever you want to do it?

22:46.656 --> 22:48.742
I just wanted
to know if he was all right.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.538
And he's not, is he?

22:55.957 --> 22:57.125
(cries)

23:01.505 --> 23:02.839
He's gonna be.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.718
And it's not your fault.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.762
You hear me?
None of us blame you.

23:11.848 --> 23:13.767
I think we gotta
get you back in therapy.

23:14.559 --> 23:20.023
So you can look at
these decisions that
you're making and why.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.900
Okay.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.194
I love you, baby.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.695
I love you too.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.246
(inmate retching)

23:35.497 --> 23:36.790
(coughing)

23:45.924 --> 23:47.092
(coughing continues)

23:48.885 --> 23:50.011
(coughing)

23:51.930 --> 23:53.098
Let me find somebody.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.183
Don't. Leave me alone.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.685
Maybe we should help her.

23:56.726 --> 24:00.272
(coughing continues)

24:01.440 --> 24:02.983
Guard! I need a guard!

24:04.860 --> 24:06.194
(buzzer)

24:08.864 --> 24:09.781
What was she on?

24:10.740 --> 24:11.992
I told you, I don't know.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.326
Is she gonna be okay?

24:13.368 --> 24:15.162
Who knows? They're taking
her to the E.R.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.788
Where'd she get the drugs?

24:20.584 --> 24:22.085
Hey. I'm talking to you.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.962
Who gave her
the drugs?

24:25.630 --> 24:27.632
I don't know.
No idea.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.559
Hi.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.977
Hey.

24:40.061 --> 24:42.230
Wow, you set the table
and everything.

24:42.272 --> 24:42.898
Mm-hmm.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.901
The table that we
are going to have to baby-proof.

24:45.942 --> 24:49.488
Along with that,
and that and...
I made a list.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.697
Don't worry.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.574
I'll take care
of everything.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.826
(sighs)

24:56.244 --> 24:57.996
How much longer
are we gonna be able
to keep this up?

24:59.498 --> 25:00.582
(sighs)

25:00.624 --> 25:02.834
As long as it takes, babe.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.922
When they move him
to that rehab center?

25:06.963 --> 25:09.132
I mean, I can't imagine
leaving him there at night.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.886
Well, I can't either,
but I mean, we have to.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.725
So, I, um--

25:18.767 --> 25:21.686
I saw Jude
with Noah today.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.023
(sighs)

25:25.065 --> 25:26.149
Stop, wait.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.567
-Just, would you--
-We told them.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.652
I know, just wait.

25:28.693 --> 25:29.778
(chuckles)

25:29.819 --> 25:30.904
(sighs)

25:32.239 --> 25:34.533
Noah gave Jude
an envelope.

25:34.574 --> 25:35.116
(scoffs)

25:35.158 --> 25:37.869
And I'm not proud
to admit this, but I...

25:37.911 --> 25:40.497
went into Jude's locker,
and I looked inside.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.831
And was it pot?

25:41.873 --> 25:43.291
That's what I was thinking,

25:43.333 --> 25:44.960
but no, it wasn't pot.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.836
It was a poem.

25:47.837 --> 25:50.298
A really bad poem...
(chuckles)

25:52.509 --> 25:56.846
that Noah wrote for Jude
about hope and strength.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.808
-And, so we--
-So...

25:59.849 --> 26:03.061
Callie's in juvie,
we don't know when
she'll be getting out.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.480
If she takes the deal,
it could be another
eight months.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.400
I mean, Jesus isn't
coming home anytime soon.

26:08.441 --> 26:09.776
I just wonder...

26:11.820 --> 26:14.864
Should we be taking away
another person from Jude?

26:14.906 --> 26:18.952
Someone who really
cares about him,
after Connor and Jack?

26:20.745 --> 26:22.330
He's just lost so much.

26:26.710 --> 26:31.673
(chattering)

26:36.219 --> 26:38.805
Move that pail against the wall.
Somebody could trip over it.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.269
Why'd you get
the guards involved?

26:44.311 --> 26:45.770
Why didn't you just
let her puke it out?

26:46.354 --> 26:48.732
She wasn't just puking,
she was turning blue.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.233
Yeah? Well, guess what?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.901
Now they know
we got drugs in here.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.737
They're gonna want to find out
who's bringing them in.

26:53.778 --> 26:54.821
I won't say anything.

26:54.863 --> 26:55.947
Oh, I know you won't.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.664
That kind of attitude
is gonna get you in a lot
of trouble around here.

27:04.706 --> 27:07.125
Inmate infraction.
I need backup!

27:07.167 --> 27:08.209
She threw this at me.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.045
Up against the fence, now!

27:10.086 --> 27:11.129
(grunts)

27:20.096 --> 27:21.514
Hey.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.976
Can I talk to you
out here?

27:26.227 --> 27:27.812
Sure.

27:30.899 --> 27:35.320
♪ When we were waiting
by the shore ♪

27:36.780 --> 27:38.114
What is it?
What's wrong?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.701
Did you have sex with Nick?

27:41.743 --> 27:43.328
No!

27:44.788 --> 27:46.081
Are you telling me
the truth?

27:46.122 --> 27:48.792
Yes. I didn't have
sex with Nick.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.835
Why are you
asking me this now?

27:50.877 --> 27:52.504
It's something Brandon said.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.255
What did--
What did Brandon say?

27:54.297 --> 27:55.799
It doesn't matter.
The point is--

27:55.840 --> 27:57.717
No. Did Brandon say
that I had sex with Nick?

27:57.759 --> 27:59.135
-No.
-Because how would he know?

27:59.177 --> 27:59.803
How do I know?

27:59.844 --> 28:02.722
How am I supposed to know
if you're lying to me?

28:02.764 --> 28:04.474
-I'm not.
-Yeah, but you have.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.351
Over and over, and I just...

28:07.519 --> 28:08.770
I don't think...

28:09.771 --> 28:11.189
You don't think what?

28:11.231 --> 28:13.900
That I'm ever gonna be able
to trust you again.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.406
So what are you saying?

28:20.824 --> 28:22.200
I'm saying
that I'm done.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.747
Please, don't do this.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.582
We just got back together.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.334
And you lied
about Nick,

28:31.376 --> 28:34.379
about the Adderall,
and who knows what else?

28:34.421 --> 28:36.089
There's nothing else.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.258
I'm sorry.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.803
You just had sex with me,
and now you're dumping me?

28:41.845 --> 28:44.013
-I shouldn't have done that.
-I thought you loved me.

28:46.683 --> 28:47.892
So did I.

29:00.029 --> 29:01.573
What did you say to Mat?

29:01.614 --> 29:03.742
Uh... what did you--

29:03.783 --> 29:05.994
He said that you told him
something about me and Nick.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.580
-No.
-Well, you said something
that upset him.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.834
Oh. Um...

29:12.876 --> 29:16.171
I didn't tell him anything.
I, uh-- I asked him
something.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.380
What?

29:19.132 --> 29:21.718
I asked him if
you could be pregnant.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.386
Pregnant?

29:23.386 --> 29:26.681
I saw Emma buy a pregnancy
test at the hospital

29:26.723 --> 29:28.683
and I saw her
give you the bag.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.935
She was buying me tampons.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.901
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I-- I didn't know.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.068
Okay, well,
why didn't you ask me?

29:39.110 --> 29:41.446
'Cause you're my sister.
And I-- I--

29:41.488 --> 29:42.781
Well, thanks, Brandon.
Thanks a lot.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.074
Because of you,
Mat just broke up with me.

29:48.536 --> 29:49.662
-(sighs)
-(door buzzes)

29:52.081 --> 29:55.001
(indistinct shouting)

30:21.402 --> 30:24.697
(indistinct shouting)

31:14.038 --> 31:15.415
Hey. Sharp.

31:15.456 --> 31:16.833
Yeah, it's not too much?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.501
No. You want
some help with that?

31:19.502 --> 31:21.129
Nah, it's-- it's good.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.756
I'm not gonna
wear it anyway.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.175
Look, AJ,
I know you're worried
about the hearing.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.970
We all are.
But Callie's a strong girl.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.097
She's gonna be okay.

31:33.182 --> 31:35.810
Look, and I know
we've had some disagreements
about her, but...

31:37.353 --> 31:38.980
Look, I love her
like family, AJ.

31:41.524 --> 31:42.901
Like I love you.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.320
And I've been thinking...

31:47.405 --> 31:48.907
I want to adopt you.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.414
You don't have to
answer right now,
just think about it.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.834
Mm-hmm.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.294
Okay.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.923
Let's go.

32:07.967 --> 32:11.304
(chattering)

32:16.601 --> 32:17.602
Why didn't you
tell me about the hearing?

32:17.644 --> 32:21.856
You deliberately withheld it
from me after promising
that you would keep me informed.

32:21.898 --> 32:22.774
This is unacceptable, Stef.

32:22.815 --> 32:23.816
-Robert, please.
-Don't--

32:23.858 --> 32:25.902
I brought my lawyer.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.780
Now, if you don't allow me
to participate in the wellbeing
of my daughter,

32:28.821 --> 32:30.073
and she is my daughter,

32:30.114 --> 32:32.951
I am prepared
to sue you for custody,

32:32.992 --> 32:36.579
which I can do by proving
that you are unfit parents.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.873
-Hey, you know what?
-Hey, hey, hey.
She's right here.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.750
-Hello, sweetheart.
-Hi.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.877
We brought you
some clothes.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.462
I hope we picked
something that you like.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.715
Now, we have a few minutes
with your attorney

32:47.757 --> 32:49.717
before you go
in front of the judge.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.761
All right? Go get changed,
we'll be right here.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.680
Don't worry, baby.
We're right here.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.309
I want to be
in that room.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.232
So, what happens
if I lose?

33:04.273 --> 33:06.234
You'll be transfered
to adult court,

33:06.275 --> 33:08.111
and you'll have
a bail hearing.

33:08.152 --> 33:08.945
So I could get out?

33:08.987 --> 33:13.908
Yes, I see no reason
why a judge in adult court
would deny bail.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.952
Well, I'll put up the bond,
whatever it is.

33:18.538 --> 33:19.372
Sweetheart,
your mom and I
have discussed this,

33:19.414 --> 33:22.709
and I'm not sure that you're
gonna wanna hear what
we have to say,

33:22.750 --> 33:25.878
but we really, really feel
that you should take the plea.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.715
Hopefully, you won't have to
spend the next eight months
in juvie.

33:28.756 --> 33:29.924
Lena:
But even if you do,

33:29.966 --> 33:31.634
as soon as you turn 18,
you'll be out.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.761
Free. You'll have no record.

33:33.803 --> 33:37.473
And I know this sounds harsh,
but we really think this is
the safest bet.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.267
I don't want
to contradict
your moms, but I--

33:39.308 --> 33:40.935
I disagree.
I think we should fight this.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.812
So, that's exactly
what you're doing.
Contradicting us.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.981
Honestly, do you think
that Callie could possibly

33:45.023 --> 33:46.858
be convicted
of any of these charges?

33:46.899 --> 33:48.735
-It's absurd.
-Stef: Robert, listen,

33:48.776 --> 33:51.029
you live
in a privileged world,

33:51.070 --> 33:54.824
and I don't think that
you really understand
the system.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.368
Hey, you think that
bad guys go to jail
and that the good guys

33:57.410 --> 33:59.078
get out free,
and it's not that simple.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.039
The judge is not
going to see

34:01.080 --> 34:03.041
the Callie that we know
and love.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.917
All he's gonna see
is that she has a file.

34:04.959 --> 34:05.752
She has a record.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.838
He's not gonna ask her
why she did the things
that she did.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.505
All he's gonna see
is that she did them.

34:10.547 --> 34:11.924
And that's what he's
gonna judge her on.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.052
What if she's given
the opportunity to explain?

34:14.092 --> 34:15.762
That's a risk
that she can't afford to take.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.513
Callie:
I'm not going back there.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.058
To juvie.

34:21.684 --> 34:22.768
I can't.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.605
So we have to fight.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.780
Your honor, the state
would like to try
Miss Adams Foster

34:33.821 --> 34:36.364
as an adult.
She is a serial recidivist.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.493
Two prior stints
in Juvenile Detention,

34:38.534 --> 34:41.245
and time in a group home
for girls has done nothing

34:41.286 --> 34:44.165
to reform Miss Adams Foster's
pattern of criminal behavior.

34:44.206 --> 34:46.708
Not to mention the fact
that in her shot time in juvie,

34:46.751 --> 34:49.128
she managed to get into
an altercation with a guard.

34:49.170 --> 34:52.507
She's failed to benefit
from any of the rehabilitation
programs offered

34:52.547 --> 34:54.132
by the juvenile system,

34:54.175 --> 34:56.511
and I see no reason why
that would change now.

34:56.552 --> 34:59.097
Felony hit and run.
Vehicular assault.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.599
Considering the seriousness
of these charges,

35:01.641 --> 35:03.351
considering that
she's almost 18,

35:03.392 --> 35:05.937
the prosecution asks the court
to dismiss the petition

35:05.978 --> 35:08.314
and to send Miss Adams Foster
to adult court.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.982
(chairs slide)

35:11.067 --> 35:11.651
(whispering)

35:11.651 --> 35:15.238
Your honor,
Callie is a 17-year-old girl.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.281
She won't turn 18
for nearly a year.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.117
I wouldn't call that
almost an adult.

35:19.158 --> 35:22.328
Callie has excelled in school,
her attendance is perfect.

35:22.370 --> 35:26.332
She has loving parents,
devoted siblings.
You see them all here.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.836
If allowed to argue
the charges in a juvenile court
jurisdictional hearing,

35:29.877 --> 35:32.171
I am confident
that we can prove
these charges are false.

35:32.213 --> 35:35.258
Your Honor, Miss Adams Foster
is not refuting the fact

35:35.299 --> 35:36.968
that she left the scene
of an accident.

35:37.009 --> 35:38.177
That's a hit and run.

35:38.219 --> 35:38.845
An accident she caused,
by the way.

35:38.886 --> 35:41.597
There is no proof
that Callie caused the accident.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.808
She was a passenger
in the car.

35:43.850 --> 35:44.433
She called 911.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.936
She had no idea
she shouldn't leave the scene.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.813
But for the record,
none of that is relevant.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.940
Since this isn't
a jurisdictional hearing.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.733
Your honor,

35:52.775 --> 35:55.111
you send a girl like Callie
to be tried as an adult

35:55.153 --> 35:56.696
and you might as well
be throwing her away,

35:56.737 --> 35:57.822
and you know it.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.283
Callie is not
a threat to society.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.743
She is a girl
with artistic ambitions,

36:02.785 --> 36:05.163
excited for
her senior year
of high school.

36:05.204 --> 36:06.956
She has turned
her life around.

36:07.915 --> 36:08.624
So please,

36:08.666 --> 36:11.919
please don't make the mistake
of trying her as an adult.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.797
You could ruin a life
that is actually succeeding.

36:18.676 --> 36:19.927
Judge:
Thank you, Ms. O'Brien.

36:19.969 --> 36:23.472
You make a compelling argument.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.976
We have a young lady here
who is doing well in school...

36:27.351 --> 36:30.354
does have a loving,
stable home,

36:30.396 --> 36:33.858
and that distinguishes her
from most of the kids
that I see in this court.

36:35.735 --> 36:39.238
But what concerns me
is that despite having
these advantages,

36:39.280 --> 36:43.201
Callie still continues
to not only find
but make trouble.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.457
I'm going to agree
with the prosecution.

36:49.498 --> 36:52.752
Juvenile detention has failed
to give her the wake-up call
that she needs,

36:52.793 --> 36:58.049
so I'm going to send
Ms. Adams Foster and her case
to adult court.

37:03.596 --> 37:04.805
It's okay, it's okay.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.893
Jude:
What if she loses again?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.853
Well, Robert can afford
the best defense.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.856
And, uh, maybe they
can even get the case dismissed

37:13.898 --> 37:15.274
in adult court.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.906
So, your mom and I
have been talking.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.241
Uh-huh.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.450
(laughs)

37:24.492 --> 37:25.368
And, uh...

37:25.368 --> 37:29.038
we decided that it would
be all right if you wanted
to see Noah again.

37:30.289 --> 37:31.457
Really?

37:31.499 --> 37:34.877
Yes, but no more pot.

37:34.919 --> 37:35.962
-Okay.
-No, I mean it, Jude.

37:35.962 --> 37:40.341
We have to know that we can
trust you, or this will be
a very short-lived reunion.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.343
Yeah. Yes. Okay.

37:43.552 --> 37:44.887
Okay.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.305
Why don't you go
give him a call?

37:53.312 --> 37:54.188
I'll stay with Jesus
tonight, all right?

37:54.188 --> 37:58.234
-Mm. You know, we have to look
at that rehab facility tomorrow.
-Mm-hmm.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.528
-Yes.
-I wish we could just
bring him home.

38:00.569 --> 38:01.988
Me too.

38:03.572 --> 38:06.701
Mm. At least

more money, babe.

Yeah, but still, a lot's
gonna fall on your shoulders.

(Emma talks indistinctly)

41:03.961 --> 41:09.383
All right! We got your
pizza pie, my babies. We got
your pizza pie right here.

41:09.425 --> 41:10.885
Make room, make room.

41:10.926 --> 41:12.720
All right. The first piece
goes to the man of the hour.

41:12.761 --> 41:14.513
-I, um--
-It's okay.

41:14.555 --> 41:17.183
-All right.
-Here you go.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.645
Uh, M-- Mom,

41:21.687 --> 41:25.441
w-- what are-- what--
what is the round thing?

41:25.483 --> 41:28.235
That's a pepperoni, honey.
It's your favorite.

41:28.277 --> 41:29.862
N-- No.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.197
You love pepperoni.

41:31.238 --> 41:33.324
I-- I don't-- I don't want it.

41:33.365 --> 41:35.534
Okay, why don't you, um,
take a bite and just see
how it tastes.

41:35.576 --> 41:36.785
No!

41:37.912 --> 41:38.454
No.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.540
Okay. Let's, uh--
let's just take it off.

41:41.582 --> 41:44.835
We'll just take it
right off and then there's
no more pepperoni

41:44.877 --> 41:47.713
so it's just...
it's a cheese pizza pizza!

41:47.755 --> 41:49.423
There we go! There we go.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.799
There you go.
So this is just cheese.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.176
No, I don't want it. I told you!

42:13.405 --> 42:15.157
(theme song playing)

42:15.199 --> 42:17.868
(no discernible dialog)
