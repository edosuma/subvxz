00:24.502 --> 00:26.841
Retro rockets are about to fire in.

00:31.196 --> 00:34.866
1, 2, 3, breathe.
1, 2, 3, breathe.

00:40.863 --> 00:42.625
We dream.

00:45.158 --> 00:46.892
It's who we are.

00:48.328 --> 00:51.534
Down to our bones, our cells.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.395
That instinct to build.

00:54.702 --> 00:58.686
That drive to seek beyond what we know.

00:59.042 --> 01:00.706
It's in our DNA.

01:01.265 --> 01:03.408
We crossed the oceans,

01:05.022 --> 01:07.048
we conquered the skies.

01:09.245 --> 01:11.837
And when there were no
more frontiers on Earth

01:13.408 --> 01:15.932
we launched ourselves among the stars.

01:17.825 --> 01:20.751
We choose to
go to the Moon in this decade

01:20.782 --> 01:22.360
and do the other things,

01:22.606 --> 01:26.646
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

01:28.930 --> 01:30.999
The heavens
beckoned a new generation

01:31.017 --> 01:33.196
of innovators and explorers,

01:33.908 --> 01:37.119
seeking to take human kind even further.

01:38.776 --> 01:42.662
We can push
out into the solar system.

01:43.878 --> 01:46.732
Not just to visit but to stay.

01:47.622 --> 01:50.250
That was when
Mars became real for all of us.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.535
And for those of us who were around

01:52.572 --> 01:54.813
to see the first days, it was...

01:55.125 --> 01:56.942
electrifying.

02:01.762 --> 02:03.438
The world's leading space agencies

02:03.444 --> 02:06.809
united as the International
Mars Science Foundation.

02:07.539 --> 02:11.621
And joined with private industry
to accomplish one shared goal.

02:12.597 --> 02:16.054
To build a home for humankind on Mars.

02:17.216 --> 02:19.767
People weren't just talking
about the red planet,

02:20.093 --> 02:22.838
they were making plans to go there.

02:23.703 --> 02:26.570
And after years of training
in the Astronaut Corps

02:27.043 --> 02:31.647
I was chosen to command the
first human mission to Mars.

02:34.874 --> 02:36.249
Wonder,

02:38.244 --> 02:39.742
- wonder.
- _

02:40.939 --> 02:43.624
For as long as we've
looked up at the night sky

02:43.947 --> 02:45.726
that is what we felt.

02:46.010 --> 02:48.754
We named the planets
that hang among the stars

02:48.789 --> 02:50.326
after our gods.

02:50.446 --> 02:53.194
And gave them the same
power to control our fate.

02:53.489 --> 02:57.055
With the support of the
space-going nations of the IMSF

02:57.098 --> 02:59.449
the Mars Mission Corporation

02:59.569 --> 03:03.377
has overcome the most
daunting engineering challenges

03:03.832 --> 03:06.288
our species has ever faced.

03:07.050 --> 03:09.609
This allows the brave pioneers

03:10.094 --> 03:11.850
standing before you today,

03:12.157 --> 03:14.060
to bring humanity

03:14.459 --> 03:15.809
into a new era.

03:17.110 --> 03:19.860
We will no longer stare
and wonder at those planets

03:19.873 --> 03:21.752
we named for our gods.

03:23.010 --> 03:25.257
But take our place among them.

03:39.732 --> 03:42.139
Ed Grann could sell anything,

03:43.170 --> 03:45.470
but he was more than a salesman.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.695
He was brilliant.

03:48.427 --> 03:51.828
_

03:53.068 --> 03:56.291
She's 14 stories base to nose.

03:56.930 --> 03:59.362
That's a fancy
jacket you got today Ed.

04:01.258 --> 04:03.886
_

04:03.924 --> 04:05.795
_

04:05.826 --> 04:08.066
_

04:09.429 --> 04:11.473
And as much as any of us,

04:11.786 --> 04:13.352
he was a believer.

04:14.654 --> 04:17.232
He promised the world he
would give us the technology

04:17.238 --> 04:19.534
we needed to leave our home,

04:20.202 --> 04:22.493
and build a new one.

04:23.443 --> 04:25.570
And he delivered.

04:28.467 --> 04:29.910
This is it.

04:30.474 --> 04:32.052
Daedalus.

04:33.348 --> 04:35.177
Take good care of her,

04:35.847 --> 04:38.056
she'll take good care of you.

04:41.267 --> 04:43.090
She's your ship now.

05:06.129 --> 05:08.032
Drives better than a Cadillac.

05:12.016 --> 05:14.318
But that shine isn't gonna last.

05:16.761 --> 05:19.500
Over the next 7 months your
bodies are gonna be exposed

05:19.512 --> 05:22.459
to nearly 200 times the
dose of a normal year's

05:22.477 --> 05:25.043
worth of radiation exposure on Earth.

05:25.565 --> 05:28.211
Calcium will leach from your bones

05:28.248 --> 05:30.409
which will lose nearly 10% of their mass

05:30.433 --> 05:32.251
before you even get to Mars.

05:32.717 --> 05:35.878
There is no test that can
tell you whether or not

05:35.896 --> 05:38.714
the notion of being 60
million kilometers away

05:38.749 --> 05:40.556
from the planet on which you were born

05:40.568 --> 05:42.986
can shatter your mind in so many pieces.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.589
Some of us if not all of us

05:47.596 --> 05:50.800
will almost certainly
die on this mission.

05:52.642 --> 05:54.815
Might be in takeoff,
might be in landing,

05:54.851 --> 05:57.074
might be in the new world itself.

05:58.259 --> 06:00.536
Now you all are the bravest group

06:00.567 --> 06:03.281
of women and men I have ever met.

06:05.129 --> 06:07.676
I'm damn proud to be here with you.

06:09.997 --> 06:12.630
But right now I want you
to stop and ask yourself

06:12.673 --> 06:17.143
what really is important
to you about this mission.

06:20.918 --> 06:23.104
And if the answer to
that question is not

06:23.122 --> 06:26.370
the most important thing in your life

06:26.490 --> 06:28.716
then I'm gonna invite
you to walk out that door

06:28.759 --> 06:30.859
and go pursue whatever that thing is.

06:31.829 --> 06:34.849
And don't ever look back, because no one

06:34.855 --> 06:38.004
will ever have the right
to hold it against you.

06:39.619 --> 06:42.112
Daedalus, you're a go for launch

06:42.149 --> 06:44.948
in T-minus 17 seconds and counting.

06:45.421 --> 06:47.558
Mission analytic executor,

06:47.564 --> 06:50.321
you have primary control of
all the critical functions.

06:50.548 --> 06:52.439
Mae, the ship is yours.

06:52.559 --> 06:54.225
I am in control.

06:54.227 --> 06:55.624
The launch of Daedalus

06:55.661 --> 06:59.695
was the beginning of our
historic 7-month journey to Mars.

07:04.213 --> 07:06.945
But it wasn't easy to
reach the red planet.

07:07.908 --> 07:10.623
We needed visionaries to guide the way.

07:14.878 --> 07:18.483
Mars and Earth are sister planets.

07:19.237 --> 07:21.853
The young Mars had rivers and lakes,

07:21.855 --> 07:24.056
it even had an ocean.

07:24.442 --> 07:27.025
If there was water on Mars,

07:27.145 --> 07:29.527
couldn't there possibly be life?

07:29.647 --> 07:31.278
Is it habitable?

07:31.398 --> 07:33.436
If you really want to understand,

07:33.461 --> 07:37.433
we want to, need to, go to Mars.

07:38.802 --> 07:40.103
We need to go to Mars

07:40.140 --> 07:42.467
because it protects us from extinction.

07:43.154 --> 07:45.511
There's all sorts of things
that could happen on Earth

07:45.524 --> 07:47.745
that can kill all the
humans on the planet.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.392
But once humans are on
two different planets

07:50.423 --> 07:53.364
the odds of extinction
drop to nearly zero.

07:54.121 --> 07:56.803
Getting to Mars will be risky,

07:56.923 --> 07:58.226
dangerous,

07:58.428 --> 07:59.791
uncomfortable.

08:00.448 --> 08:03.795
But it will be the
greatest adventure ever.

08:03.915 --> 08:05.906
Ever in human history.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.474
This is hallowed ground,

08:20.327 --> 08:22.537
it's called Launchpad 39A,

08:23.887 --> 08:28.313
and it's the place that
the first humans left Earth,

08:29.774 --> 08:32.033
then went to another heavenly body.

08:33.169 --> 08:36.188
So this is um, I think, probably,

08:36.226 --> 08:38.239
I think it's the greatest
launchsite on Earth.

08:39.455 --> 08:41.958
Buzz Aldrin,
Mike Collins, Neil Armstrong

08:41.977 --> 08:45.863
get into the transfer van to Pad 39A.

08:47.104 --> 08:50.542
Pad 39A was used
for the Apollo 11 mission,

08:50.849 --> 08:53.372
and then with the space shuttle.

08:55.417 --> 09:00.058
So it's a place with incredible
historical significance.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.527
Now NASA has given Launchpad 39A

09:04.564 --> 09:06.541
to SpaceX to use.

09:07.626 --> 09:10.831
The long term goal of SpaceX
is to develop the technology

09:10.874 --> 09:14.545
necessary to establish a
self-sustaining city on Mars.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.071
SpaceX's primary mission is absolutely

09:21.106 --> 09:23.742
to make life interplanetary.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.216
We can explore the universe,

09:26.252 --> 09:27.892
we can put a colony on Mars.

09:27.953 --> 09:29.635
People can be interplanetary

09:29.672 --> 09:32.091
and it's just an engineering
problem like any other.

09:32.485 --> 09:34.860
It just takes a group
of people who care a lot,

09:34.872 --> 09:37.285
and are happy to work really
hard to make that happen.

09:40.029 --> 09:42.011
When Elon Musk decided

09:42.054 --> 09:44.498
"I'm gonna go off and build
my own rocket company",

09:44.764 --> 09:46.733
everyone thought he was crazy.

09:46.751 --> 09:48.215
Everyone laughed at him.

09:48.335 --> 09:52.318
Now SpaceX has a better
record launching things

09:52.339 --> 09:55.489
than practically any
rocket company in the world.

09:55.689 --> 09:58.667
They have a contract
from NASA to deliver

09:58.697 --> 10:01.381
very essential supplies
to the space station.

10:01.416 --> 10:04.149
Dragon spacecraft now the first-ever

10:04.186 --> 10:07.968
commercial spacecraft to visit
the International Space Station.

10:08.088 --> 10:10.830
They have investors, they
have to have revenues,

10:11.118 --> 10:14.789
they want the business of
launching billion dollar satellites.

10:14.909 --> 10:17.628
At the same time, they're
focused on launching

10:17.647 --> 10:19.230
a new civilization on Mars.

10:19.232 --> 10:23.196
So the stakes for every
rocket launch are huge.

10:24.326 --> 10:26.408
I think it's
important for us to try to get

10:26.437 --> 10:30.012
to a self-sustaining situation
on Mars as soon as possible.

10:30.282 --> 10:33.121
SpaceX, Falcon9
and Dragon are go for launch.

10:33.352 --> 10:34.779
T-minus 30 seconds.

10:35.095 --> 10:36.814
Because either we're gonna become

10:36.816 --> 10:39.864
a multi-planet species and
a space-faring civilization,

10:40.100 --> 10:41.617
or we're gonna be stuck on one planet

10:41.621 --> 10:43.340
until some eventual extinction event.

10:43.556 --> 10:44.735
T-minus 20.

10:44.799 --> 10:45.811
In order for me to be

10:45.836 --> 10:47.756
excited and inspired about the future,

10:47.987 --> 10:49.176
it's gotta be the first option.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.371
It's gotta be: We're gonna be
a space-faring civilization.

10:51.892 --> 10:57.171
T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

10:57.545 --> 11:03.321
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

11:05.110 --> 11:06.557
What am I ready for?

11:06.607 --> 11:09.494
I'm ready to be one of
the first human beings

11:09.922 --> 11:11.282
to go to Mars. I mean,

11:12.750 --> 11:14.292
could you imagine that?

11:17.287 --> 11:18.656
That's like a dream.

11:18.819 --> 11:21.962
I think Amelia
Earhart once said that "adventure

11:22.082 --> 11:24.393
is worthwhile in itself."

11:24.717 --> 11:26.740
Uh, it could be that.

11:27.359 --> 11:29.049
If we don't succeed

11:29.299 --> 11:32.732
we still paved the path
for people after us to come,

11:33.910 --> 11:35.177
and follow our lead.

11:35.987 --> 11:39.577
Becoming an interplanetary species is,

11:39.925 --> 11:42.087
it's our best chance to guarantee

11:42.121 --> 11:44.649
humankind's long-term survival.

11:44.891 --> 11:48.742
And, getting to be
part of that it's just.

11:49.596 --> 11:50.864
I mean it's...

11:52.023 --> 11:53.457
It's everything.

11:56.423 --> 11:58.004
Yeah it is.

11:59.502 --> 12:01.918
We've got the opportunity to

12:01.997 --> 12:04.648
ensure that humankind continues.

12:05.356 --> 12:07.739
You know, we've been training
for this half our lives.

12:07.925 --> 12:10.301
And we've been
dreaming about it even longer.

12:10.345 --> 12:12.457
We're ready to
give everything for thismission

12:12.501 --> 12:14.289
you know, all of us are.

12:14.357 --> 12:15.467
We are coming to you

12:15.492 --> 12:18.615
from the International Mars
Science Foundation headquarters,

12:18.635 --> 12:20.044
in Vienna, Austria.

12:20.079 --> 12:23.002
With live coverage from the
Mars Mission Corporation's

12:23.022 --> 12:24.898
mission control center in London,

12:24.942 --> 12:27.556
and an optical feed
from the Daedalus itself,

12:27.676 --> 12:30.066
at a 10 minute, 20 second delay.

12:35.924 --> 12:38.857
We had survived a 209-day journey

12:38.886 --> 12:40.387
through deep space.

12:40.655 --> 12:44.009
But landing a 14-story ship safely,

12:44.059 --> 12:47.393
upright, and on target
on the surface of Mars?

12:48.517 --> 12:51.925
That was a whole different
kind of challenge.

12:59.562 --> 13:00.756
Um,

13:02.037 --> 13:04.193
by the time this message reaches you,

13:05.647 --> 13:09.403
whatever is about to happen already has.

13:11.864 --> 13:14.619
If all went as planned then we are

13:14.634 --> 13:18.092
touched down at the
base camp, we are docked

13:19.334 --> 13:21.952
and we're ready to begin
the most exciting phase

13:21.981 --> 13:24.623
of scientific exploration
in human history.

13:28.665 --> 13:30.153
And if we haven't,

13:33.212 --> 13:35.256
we went into the darkness

13:36.975 --> 13:39.263
so that you could find the light.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.154
This is for you, Dad.

13:50.570 --> 13:52.259
On my mark.

13:56.154 --> 13:58.148
Begin entry sequence.

14:00.986 --> 14:02.160
Mark.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.846
EDL sequence engaged.

14:06.074 --> 14:08.204
You ready for this?

14:09.095 --> 14:11.053
Are you?

14:14.881 --> 14:17.713
Put your helmets
on and seal your kits.

14:26.752 --> 14:28.831
Daedalus descent to the surface

14:28.869 --> 14:35.477
has been initiated at
425 kilometers altitude.

14:36.137 --> 14:38.456
By the time
this message reaches you,

14:38.576 --> 14:42.222
whatever is about to happen already has.

14:42.437 --> 14:44.247
If all went as planned,

14:44.278 --> 14:46.158
we are touched down at the base camp,

14:46.199 --> 14:48.185
we are docked and we're ready to begin

14:48.201 --> 14:51.851
the most exciting phase of scientific
exploration in human history.

14:52.697 --> 14:54.017
And if we haven't...

14:54.040 --> 14:55.676
9 minutes 30 seconds till landing.

14:55.694 --> 14:57.935
... know that we went into the darkness

14:58.545 --> 15:00.262
so that you could find the light.

15:03.289 --> 15:05.182
Vector is good.

15:05.241 --> 15:07.426
.05 G's,

15:08.881 --> 15:10.625
.1 G's.

15:17.447 --> 15:19.995
- Warning.
- Pyros didn't fire.

15:20.033 --> 15:22.401
Reaction control system error.

15:22.807 --> 15:24.771
Lift vector requires correction.

15:24.777 --> 15:26.551
RCS thrusters are offline.

15:27.362 --> 15:29.387
Check the backup computer.

15:29.670 --> 15:32.088
Backup also showing RCS is offline.

15:32.156 --> 15:33.427
This thing is real.

15:33.439 --> 15:36.367
RCS thruster electrical board offline.

15:36.487 --> 15:39.529
Propellant valves have
not been commanded to open.

15:40.119 --> 15:41.901
The thrusters can't fire.

15:41.936 --> 15:46.012
Recommend immediate manual
replacement to 40 circuits.

15:46.059 --> 15:49.038
- I'll get down there and check it out.
- No, this is mine.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.695
Do a fault tree and talk
me through it on comm.

15:52.265 --> 15:53.837
You're going to have to work fast.

15:53.856 --> 15:55.222
I got it.

15:57.015 --> 16:00.458
Warning seat belt harness released.

16:10.282 --> 16:12.063
Failure identified.

16:14.254 --> 16:15.904
- Found it.
- Talk to me.

16:15.938 --> 16:19.018
It's a failure in bus 14-15-48,

16:19.062 --> 16:21.233
aft-starboard terminal.

16:21.253 --> 16:23.709
4-15-48, copy that.

16:23.743 --> 16:26.214
It's the pyro initiation circuit,

16:26.272 --> 16:29.342
4-3-6-double-bravo.

16:29.592 --> 16:31.807
Moving out of micro-G.

16:32.607 --> 16:37.383
Woah, OK, we got a bit of gravity here.

16:37.849 --> 16:39.276
Ah, wow.

16:39.396 --> 16:41.912
The failure must have
affected the whole bundle.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.774
71 seconds
before we're outside the window

16:44.784 --> 16:46.459
for guidance to correct.

16:46.719 --> 16:48.723
I'm gonna need you
to give me the number again.

16:48.743 --> 16:51.081
4-3-6-double-bravo.

16:51.201 --> 16:53.070
There we go.

16:57.082 --> 17:00.246
Warning thrust still inactive,

17:00.471 --> 17:04.409
60 seconds remaining to
restore reaction control system

17:04.458 --> 17:06.752
before landing is compromised.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.752
Ah, the short
cooked all four connections,

17:09.782 --> 17:12.031
I'm going to have to
cannibalize a replacement.

17:12.111 --> 17:14.733
Mae, identify a
PCB with matching electronics

17:14.739 --> 17:17.664
to board 4-36-double-bravo.

17:17.961 --> 17:20.814
Cruise altitude control thruster pyro

17:20.858 --> 17:25.259
initiation circuit
board Mike-Sierra-5-15-48

17:25.284 --> 17:28.002
- is identical.
- Mike-Sierra-5-15-48,

17:28.038 --> 17:29.423
Roger that.

17:29.691 --> 17:32.051
15 seconds left to correct.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.847
I'm switching the board now.

17:34.967 --> 17:37.296
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

17:37.517 --> 17:38.997
There you go.

17:39.420 --> 17:43.472
Warning, window for
correction is closing in 10.

17:43.533 --> 17:45.592
Thrusters are still
offline! What are we missing?

17:45.712 --> 17:48.134
- Talk to me.
- 9, 8, 7, 6.

17:48.147 --> 17:53.684
- What am I looking for?
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

17:53.724 --> 17:56.027
_

17:58.005 --> 18:00.445
Landing on Mars is really tough.

18:00.736 --> 18:04.382
We can put a one-ton
rover down on the ground,

18:06.363 --> 18:08.504
but that's all we can do right now.

18:08.624 --> 18:10.911
And for humans to be able to go to Mars,

18:11.097 --> 18:13.224
we're gonna need 40 ton.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.935
Our big challenge is indeed

18:15.984 --> 18:18.253
what it takes to get
down to the surface.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.371
Mars has an atmosphere,

18:20.587 --> 18:23.347
but it's not enough to really stop you

18:23.519 --> 18:27.685
so consequently you have
to really use retro-rockets,

18:27.906 --> 18:31.074
parachutes, bladed shields,

18:31.123 --> 18:33.800
you have every tool in the arsenal

18:33.828 --> 18:35.989
that we can throw at it
is what it's going to take

18:36.004 --> 18:37.905
to get humans down on the ground.

18:39.741 --> 18:41.578
One of the most radical ideas

18:41.588 --> 18:45.276
that SpaceX has to lower
this horrendous cost

18:45.292 --> 18:48.548
of getting into space is reusability.

18:48.668 --> 18:51.407
Elon Musk wants to be able
to fire a rocket into orbit,

18:51.627 --> 18:53.783
launch a payload into space

18:53.813 --> 18:55.443
and then fire retro rockets,

18:55.473 --> 18:59.485
and bring that rocket down to
land vertically and reuse it.

19:00.237 --> 19:02.727
And part of this whole
idea of reusability

19:02.761 --> 19:04.672
is to develop a system

19:04.711 --> 19:06.690
where you can leave Earth orbit,

19:06.810 --> 19:09.195
go to Mars and actually physically land

19:09.225 --> 19:10.570
the rocket on Mars.

19:10.690 --> 19:14.587
3, 2, 1, liftoff!

19:15.304 --> 19:16.988
This is a very hard problem

19:16.990 --> 19:19.711
because you better enter
the Mars atmosphere at

19:19.755 --> 19:22.794
an incredibly blazing fast speed.

19:24.351 --> 19:26.335
Mars atmosphere is so thin that

19:26.355 --> 19:28.766
by the time you hit the ground
if you didn't start the engines,

19:28.801 --> 19:30.470
you'd still be supersonic,

19:30.505 --> 19:34.599
so you've got to basically point
the engines into the wind at Mach 3,

19:35.365 --> 19:37.974
you gotta fire the rockets into

19:38.195 --> 19:40.076
the supersonic airstream,

19:40.610 --> 19:42.215
zero out your blast speed,

19:42.230 --> 19:44.342
deploy landing gear and land.

19:45.496 --> 19:47.298
And you got one shot.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.825
But rockets there really
don't want to work,

19:52.449 --> 19:54.560
like there's a thousand
ways that a rocket can fail

19:54.585 --> 19:56.378
and one way it can succeed.

20:14.235 --> 20:15.851
Who is Joon Seung?

20:16.435 --> 20:17.696
She's my twin,

20:19.484 --> 20:21.405
she's cap comm at mission control.

20:26.562 --> 20:28.208
It wouldn't be easy for
me to do this mission

20:28.230 --> 20:30.358
without her having
my back on the ground.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.461
Mae ID'd a faulty pyro circuit,

20:33.500 --> 20:34.714
they're working it now.

20:35.099 --> 20:36.274
You mean they were working it

20:36.286 --> 20:37.841
10 minutes and 20 seconds ago.

20:38.132 --> 20:41.172
Delay or no,
RCS status is still negative.

20:41.389 --> 20:43.024
I have Ben below deck.

20:43.059 --> 20:44.108
Found it.

20:44.115 --> 20:46.035
- Talk to me.
- Mae found him a match.

20:47.116 --> 20:48.992
- There's something else.
- Communications are in and out.

20:49.989 --> 20:51.772
Initial failure was mitigated,

20:51.892 --> 20:53.834
but thrusters are still not operational.

20:54.203 --> 20:55.308
I got it,

20:55.428 --> 20:57.764
the RCS temperature
reading is incorrect;

20:57.804 --> 20:59.361
The sensor isn't showing as faulty.

20:59.481 --> 21:01.262
By the time they receive a transmission

21:01.267 --> 21:02.894
it will be too late.

21:03.196 --> 21:05.353
We just have
to hope they found it too.

21:05.623 --> 21:07.956
If this goes to
hell on the live broadcast,

21:08.167 --> 21:10.431
IMSF may never give us another shot.

21:11.197 --> 21:13.372
If they missed that
window by more than a few seconds,

21:13.392 --> 21:15.651
they're going to shoot
right past the landing site.

21:15.877 --> 21:18.158
- I'm switching the board now.
- Without thrusters,

21:18.162 --> 21:20.566
they won't be able to
re-orient for retropropulsion.

21:20.597 --> 21:22.385
They'll have no way to
slow down for landing.

21:23.712 --> 21:25.265
Thrusters are still offline.

21:25.516 --> 21:26.954
Eyes and ears, Hana.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.306
What are we missing?

21:28.488 --> 21:29.940
Eyes and ears.

21:30.223 --> 21:31.567
What am I looking for?

21:31.720 --> 21:32.983
Mae hasn't found it.

21:33.103 --> 21:34.892
We're outside the window for correction.

21:35.116 --> 21:37.261
Reporting all systems nominal.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.173
- I don't see anything.
- Nothing.

21:39.176 --> 21:40.693
- Listen!
- 4 minutes 4 seconds.

21:40.728 --> 21:42.912
- Board is in.
- It's the RCS temp sensor.

21:42.925 --> 21:44.437
Backup system is offline.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.784
The backup sensor
is reading near nominal, Ben,

21:46.806 --> 21:49.103
permission to switch
from primary to backup.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.324
- We're too close to SRP!
- Do it.

21:51.358 --> 21:52.567
Ben you won't make it back

21:52.579 --> 21:54.222
to the flight deck for orientation!

21:54.478 --> 21:55.789
We have to abort!

21:55.909 --> 21:59.258
- I said do it!
- Warning, landing hazard.

21:59.319 --> 22:02.264
- Go.
- Recommend engaging abort.

22:02.283 --> 22:03.216
Engaged.

22:03.246 --> 22:07.679
RCS thrust is engaged,
three minutes 48 seconds.

22:07.799 --> 22:09.422
If Ben isn't back on deck soon

22:09.427 --> 22:11.215
he's going to lose
consciousness from the G's;

22:11.504 --> 22:13.497
he could end up down
there during landing.

22:13.931 --> 22:16.843
That's it Ben,
your blood pressure is good.

22:16.858 --> 22:19.286
You know the
countermeasures. Do the drill.

22:19.305 --> 22:20.420
OK.

22:20.450 --> 22:21.629
I'm watching your vitals, Ben.

22:21.904 --> 22:23.233
You can do this.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.380
His blood pressure is stable,

22:24.400 --> 22:26.863
but his heart rate and
breathing are climbing fast,

22:26.983 --> 22:29.252
he's not getting enough
blood to his head.

22:30.775 --> 22:32.892
The G's are climbing too fast!

22:34.390 --> 22:35.868
You're doing great Ben,

22:35.893 --> 22:37.307
tell me what you see.

22:37.371 --> 22:39.123
My periphery is closing in.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.740
5.0.

22:41.192 --> 22:43.895
- Tighten your abdomen.
- 5.1.

22:43.950 --> 22:46.591
That's it Ben, blow it out hard.

22:47.141 --> 22:48.587
1, 2, 3 breathe!

22:48.642 --> 22:49.679
Again!

22:49.840 --> 22:52.181
1, 2, 3, breathe, again.

22:52.362 --> 22:54.338
Guidance can't sufficiently compensate.

22:54.354 --> 22:56.550
We don't have enough control authority.

22:56.566 --> 22:57.926
Prepare for retropropulsion!

22:57.957 --> 23:00.294
1, 2, 3, breathe, again,

23:00.675 --> 23:02.459
1, 2, 3, breathe.

23:03.283 --> 23:05.845
1, 2, 3, breathe, again,

23:06.155 --> 23:08.519
-  1, 2, 3, breathe!
- Counter thrusters are about to fire!

23:08.691 --> 23:10.621
10, 9.

23:10.641 --> 23:11.868
Ben has lost consciousness!

23:11.883 --> 23:13.780
- 8, 7.
- I'm going down.

23:13.829 --> 23:15.471
- 6, 5.
- There's nothing you can do!

23:15.591 --> 23:19.502
4, 3, 2, 1.

23:19.994 --> 23:22.656
Fore and aft jets firing.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.517
Beginning reorientation maneuver!

23:27.121 --> 23:31.992
- Hang on!
- SRP in 3, 2, 1.

23:38.131 --> 23:40.080
Ben's vitals went offline,

23:40.085 --> 23:42.621
- I'm not getting any feedback!
- Radar acquisition.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.178
Terrain relative navigation initiated.

23:45.596 --> 23:47.295
Divert maneuver initiated.

23:47.334 --> 23:48.729
Constant velocity descent.

23:48.733 --> 23:49.922
Still offline.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.577
Begin throttle down,

23:52.579 --> 23:54.277
prep for final descent.

23:55.937 --> 23:57.754
We're coming in too fast!

23:58.850 --> 24:00.037
Angle is off.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.625
All systems to compensate.

24:01.635 --> 24:03.142
We have to correct. Throttle down,

24:03.668 --> 24:05.229
throttle down now!

24:06.433 --> 24:07.852
Come on.

24:12.027 --> 24:13.784
Opticals are all offline;

24:14.144 --> 24:15.970
I've got nothing on audio either.

24:29.733 --> 24:31.771
We should have
heard from them by now.

24:48.023 --> 24:49.402
Hana, what is it that you'll miss

24:49.422 --> 24:50.650
most about Earth?

24:51.229 --> 24:52.742
I'll miss my sister.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.679
My mother raised us on her own

24:55.993 --> 24:58.012
and she was army so we
were constantly moving

24:58.018 --> 24:59.433
from place to place and

24:59.465 --> 25:02.388
never really had much of a
concept of what home meant.

25:02.757 --> 25:04.070
Come on, sis.

25:04.148 --> 25:06.140
I think for me and Joon,

25:06.847 --> 25:09.770
I think for us it's
more about what happens

25:09.890 --> 25:11.522
after we get there.

25:12.968 --> 25:14.312
What about you Dr. Kamen,

25:14.320 --> 25:15.553
can you talk a little
bit about the things

25:15.561 --> 25:17.372
you'll miss about home?

25:19.549 --> 25:21.199
What will I miss if I don't go?

25:24.453 --> 25:26.653
It's hard just to leave your family,

25:27.395 --> 25:31.092
I'm gonna miss their voices but,

25:32.714 --> 25:34.631
I know what I'm doing

25:35.283 --> 25:37.307
and I know what I'm leaving behind.

25:38.906 --> 25:41.106
There is a beach
in Victoria Island, Lagos.

25:41.184 --> 25:43.565
I used to sleep on the sand

25:43.588 --> 25:45.887
and wake up with salt around my nose.

25:46.563 --> 25:49.042
We are going to be breathing
recycled air for a long time,

25:50.202 --> 25:53.977
I have a feeling I would trade
my last thermos-stabilized

25:54.097 --> 25:55.832
tapioca pudding

25:57.769 --> 25:59.859
for a taste of that ocean air.

26:02.001 --> 26:05.246
If humankind find
a way to come together and

26:05.264 --> 26:08.098
move toward a healthy evolution,

26:08.680 --> 26:10.860
this mission will have been

26:10.884 --> 26:14.924
about more than just finding
another place to live.

26:15.780 --> 26:17.167
When did you first know you wanted

26:17.202 --> 26:18.526
to become an astronaut?

26:18.646 --> 26:20.317
As far back as I can remember.

26:20.353 --> 26:22.164
I wanted to go into space.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.496
I used to lay out under the sky

26:24.528 --> 26:26.064
when I was a child and just

26:26.339 --> 26:28.170
memorize the stars.

26:29.667 --> 26:31.711
Right from then I always wanted to

26:32.171 --> 26:34.226
be up there, you know?

26:44.595 --> 26:46.745
Mission Control, this is Daedalus.

26:48.057 --> 26:49.550
We're looking at a red planet.

27:13.526 --> 27:15.360
The Daedalus crew has done it,

27:15.532 --> 27:18.050
humankind is on Mars.

27:18.239 --> 27:19.493
Ben.

27:20.031 --> 27:21.709
His vitals are readable, but

27:21.721 --> 27:23.264
he's still unconscious,

27:23.932 --> 27:25.366
I'm going down,

27:26.274 --> 27:27.433
I'll check on Ben.

27:28.556 --> 27:29.727
Confirm our position,

27:29.749 --> 27:30.977
I'll go save the ship.

27:31.001 --> 27:33.342
Woo!

27:53.277 --> 27:54.680
I'm getting off nominal ratings

27:54.707 --> 27:56.381
up and down the engine systems.

27:57.033 --> 27:59.104
Gyro circuits are offline.

28:00.463 --> 28:02.003
Tell me what you see.

28:08.089 --> 28:09.625
What do you see?

28:11.090 --> 28:12.505
It's not good.

28:13.887 --> 28:15.562
How far did we overshoot?

28:17.444 --> 28:18.391
Ben?

28:18.865 --> 28:20.737
We are coming, come on.

28:22.856 --> 28:24.230
Javier, hurry!

28:24.605 --> 28:26.749
_

28:32.348 --> 28:35.813
So the long
term goal is how fast can we

28:36.021 --> 28:39.332
establish a self-sustaining
city on Mars.

28:39.452 --> 28:41.986
Do we focus on
just trying to get the ship there

28:41.988 --> 28:44.471
and then maybe send
people some other time?

28:44.546 --> 28:45.981
I think we'd send a ship,

28:45.989 --> 28:47.509
make sure it could land OK.

28:47.629 --> 28:50.102
Assuming that lands OK
and it seems to be working,

28:50.263 --> 28:52.714
on the next Mars mission
we would send people,

28:52.887 --> 28:54.628
and additional equipment.

28:55.013 --> 28:57.484
You just need a lot of equipment to

28:57.503 --> 28:59.197
keep people alive on Mars.

28:59.727 --> 29:01.653
And so we're gonna want to assemble

29:01.664 --> 29:03.938
as much of a base as we possibly can.

29:03.966 --> 29:06.784
So some of that will
have to be landed first,

29:07.047 --> 29:09.562
may have to be robotically put together,

29:09.682 --> 29:11.931
and we may have to do it in stages.

29:12.913 --> 29:15.683
Prepositioning a
base camp is really the only

29:15.691 --> 29:18.402
plausible way to do a
manned mission to Mars,

29:18.418 --> 29:19.596
let alone a colony.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.503
You would need oxygen,

29:21.722 --> 29:23.435
you would need water,

29:23.631 --> 29:24.861
then you would need food,

29:24.873 --> 29:26.363
a source of calories.

29:26.650 --> 29:28.332
How do you generate power on Mars,

29:28.403 --> 29:30.363
we're gonna pre-position solar panels,

29:30.434 --> 29:32.855
but you can only generate so
much energy from solar panels,

29:32.863 --> 29:34.204
what if you're caught in a dust storm?

29:34.206 --> 29:35.868
We can pre-position a reactor

29:35.891 --> 29:37.864
to make power, to make propellant,

29:37.877 --> 29:39.600
maybe even additional habitats.

29:39.655 --> 29:42.099
You would
send machines to make oxygen,

29:42.111 --> 29:44.964
machines that suck water
out of the atmosphere.

29:44.975 --> 29:47.206
You really need to send 3d printers

29:47.219 --> 29:50.036
so people can build
their own things on Mars.

29:50.306 --> 29:52.015
And then we'd land a crew

29:52.058 --> 29:53.963
near those facilities.

29:54.419 --> 29:55.754
I think the first few missions

29:55.769 --> 29:57.207
people would live in the ship

29:57.405 --> 29:58.898
so that the most important
thing really would be

29:58.909 --> 30:01.066
just to make sure that we land OK,

30:01.100 --> 30:02.733
and don't damage the ship.

30:03.019 --> 30:05.093
But you can't live there very long,

30:05.213 --> 30:08.020
cosmic radiation is
gonna penetrate the ship.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.473
And what happens if your landing

30:09.475 --> 30:10.598
is off course?

30:10.621 --> 30:12.609
That is a real problem.

30:12.787 --> 30:14.799
There are so
many things that could go wrong,

30:14.807 --> 30:16.413
and there's no help.

30:16.533 --> 30:18.868
There's no emergency supply rocket

30:18.888 --> 30:20.315
that's coming right away.

30:21.262 --> 30:22.645
_

30:22.728 --> 30:25.125
Our biggest challenge on this mission

30:25.820 --> 30:29.155
is gonna be everyday survival you know.

30:29.772 --> 30:32.232
Ben, Ben, can you hear me?

30:36.848 --> 30:39.205
His respirator is damaged.

30:40.513 --> 30:42.273
We got to get his helmet off.

30:43.625 --> 30:46.178
Secure his spine, we're gonna move him.

30:46.206 --> 30:48.629
Yeah, OK, buddy.

30:49.561 --> 30:50.964
OK.

30:51.278 --> 30:52.469
Ugh.

30:58.622 --> 30:59.863
You OK, buddy?

31:00.276 --> 31:02.310
You passed out during the landing.

31:02.574 --> 31:04.217
We need to check on you.

31:04.337 --> 31:05.701
I'm OK,

31:06.891 --> 31:08.082
I'm OK.

31:09.294 --> 31:11.165
Hey, we made it.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.300
Telemetry indicates
the RCS remained offline

31:18.316 --> 31:20.537
for the first 91 seconds of entry.

31:20.792 --> 31:22.620
I've got Daedalus position back online.

31:22.858 --> 31:24.002
How bad?

31:24.473 --> 31:25.994
Put sat on the board.

31:30.477 --> 31:31.911
How far are they from base camp?

31:37.125 --> 31:38.299
How far?

31:39.510 --> 31:41.659
75.3 kilometers.

31:50.176 --> 31:50.938
We're cross checking

31:50.954 --> 31:52.977
all remaining life
support resources now.

31:53.154 --> 31:54.482
But unless Daedalus can tether

31:54.517 --> 31:56.352
to the infrastructure at base camp,

31:57.095 --> 31:58.666
it's only a matter of time.

31:59.302 --> 32:01.550
There has to be
a way to make a suborbital

32:01.562 --> 32:03.943
flight to get Daedalus to base camp.

32:04.312 --> 32:07.094
There's barely enough
fuel to get them off the ground.

32:08.223 --> 32:09.840
They're all alone up there,

32:10.367 --> 32:12.190
what are we telling them guys?

32:13.117 --> 32:14.989
Showing enough residual propellant

32:15.020 --> 32:16.665
in the system to make a single burst,

32:16.676 --> 32:19.494
but they're going to come down hard.

32:19.914 --> 32:21.912
Even harder as they just did.

32:22.126 --> 32:24.173
Landing loads were off the chart.

32:24.546 --> 32:25.658
She's right,

32:26.260 --> 32:29.019
Mae is showing engine damage
from the off-nominal landing.

32:29.292 --> 32:30.955
If they can't make any repairs,

32:31.203 --> 32:33.217
fuel won't make a difference anyway.

32:34.656 --> 32:36.498
What is Ben's status?

32:42.714 --> 32:45.302
I can see
substantial blunt trauma from impact.

32:45.304 --> 32:47.194
I want to do a full battery of scans

32:47.206 --> 32:49.365
as soon as the equipment
is prepped and calibrated.

32:49.409 --> 32:50.790
I said I'm fine.

32:51.148 --> 32:53.410
It's just the transition from micro-G's.

32:53.633 --> 32:56.049
Ben, I need to run proper tests.

32:56.103 --> 32:57.439
I understand,

32:58.956 --> 33:00.778
I need to know our status first.

33:01.727 --> 33:03.210
How long do we have?

33:04.630 --> 33:06.962
Life support status says

33:07.483 --> 33:09.846
we've got three more
days of breathable air.

33:10.853 --> 33:12.561
Daedalus isn't supposed to operate

33:12.565 --> 33:14.644
independently from base camp.

33:14.806 --> 33:16.731
It's just not viable.

33:17.045 --> 33:18.899
Come on, let's fix this,

33:19.019 --> 33:20.515
it's our guys up there.

33:22.357 --> 33:24.218
Engines are still offline.

33:25.289 --> 33:26.920
Robert, did you troubleshoot

33:26.946 --> 33:28.467
the propellant flow control?

33:30.472 --> 33:31.989
Nothing I do to the electronics

33:31.999 --> 33:33.580
will fix the engines.

33:33.986 --> 33:36.810
I can't get the ship moving
without a resupply from home.

33:39.025 --> 33:42.076
I can't get the ship moving
without a resupply from home.

33:47.512 --> 33:49.834
No chance of bunny
hopping Daedalus to base camp.

33:49.836 --> 33:51.167
There's no fix.

33:51.337 --> 33:53.568
I could fix this if I had the 3D printer

33:53.588 --> 33:54.972
from the Russian workshop.

33:55.092 --> 33:57.178
I could fix this if I had the 3D printer

33:57.188 --> 33:59.019
from the Russian workshop.

34:06.416 --> 34:08.341
The Russian workshop module.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.713
It has independent
environmental systems.

34:11.184 --> 34:13.978
And it was pre-positioned for
access to candidate lava tubes.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.520
It'd be tight, but...

34:18.340 --> 34:20.679
What if we call that the new base camp?

34:21.931 --> 34:23.965
If they upgrade the
environmental control systems

34:23.987 --> 34:25.502
and air and water recycling.

34:25.504 --> 34:27.219
They'd have a chance.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.804
That doesn't solve
the transportation problem.

34:30.054 --> 34:31.641
Can we get the rover to them?

34:31.762 --> 34:34.208
- Checking the route.
- I'll check max payload.

34:35.154 --> 34:37.547
The terrain
approaching Daedalus is complex,

34:37.830 --> 34:40.237
a fair amount of subsidence,

34:40.652 --> 34:42.568
portions that may not be stable.

34:42.688 --> 34:44.732
Can they do it, or not?

34:45.157 --> 34:47.188
Their satellite view is in and out,

34:47.308 --> 34:49.502
we have to hand off
rover command and control

34:49.569 --> 34:52.005
and let Daedalus navigate
the local topography.

34:53.523 --> 34:55.235
Do they have an option?

34:55.434 --> 34:57.507
Initiating override,

34:57.734 --> 35:02.282
transferring remote
rover control to Daedalus.

35:15.922 --> 35:17.483
You're lost,

35:17.870 --> 35:19.196
you must be lost.

35:20.725 --> 35:23.187
You sound like my ex-wife.

35:24.727 --> 35:26.354
You're lost,

35:26.474 --> 35:27.631
you must be lost.

35:27.656 --> 35:29.366
You sound like my ex-wife.

35:29.368 --> 35:30.885
Show me their progress.

35:30.940 --> 35:33.021
Maneuvering that
last kilometer of terrain

35:33.052 --> 35:36.109
from here will be painfully slow.

35:36.527 --> 35:38.670
You should have let me drive.

35:48.254 --> 35:50.166
Nothing on the externals.

36:00.131 --> 36:01.542
I told you,

36:01.947 --> 36:03.390
I'm not lost.

36:04.268 --> 36:05.803
Daedalus.

36:09.290 --> 36:10.727
Daedalus!

36:14.213 --> 36:16.386
That's our girl.

36:16.849 --> 36:19.272
It's such a beautiful thing.

36:25.479 --> 36:28.364
About time something goes right.

36:36.383 --> 36:39.359
We trained for every eventuality

36:39.372 --> 36:42.662
that it started to feel like
we'd already landed on Mars,

36:44.977 --> 36:47.697
like we'd already
succeeded in our mission,

36:49.772 --> 36:51.239
but we hadn't.

36:53.952 --> 36:55.247
We were leaving the ship

36:55.272 --> 36:57.046
that was supposed to have sustained us

36:57.070 --> 36:59.354
for our first two years on Mars.

37:01.226 --> 37:03.253
The mission to find a
new home in this place

37:03.277 --> 37:05.211
was going to be hard.

37:07.329 --> 37:09.975
Harder than any of us had imagined.

37:17.242 --> 37:20.503
Ben, I need to
run a full body scan on you.

37:20.539 --> 37:21.792
Listen,

37:22.388 --> 37:25.562
priority is getting the crew
to base camp, you understand?

37:25.863 --> 37:28.042
After that I'm all yours.

37:29.251 --> 37:30.669
It's time.

37:31.157 --> 37:32.419
Great,

37:32.794 --> 37:34.421
I'll see you down there.

37:34.541 --> 37:35.833
Are you OK?

37:35.864 --> 37:37.792
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

39:01.097 --> 39:03.142
For that brief moment,

39:03.670 --> 39:06.745
our pain and worries were gone,

39:08.507 --> 39:11.988
there was no speech, no theater,

39:12.525 --> 39:15.057
there was only awe that we had arrived.

39:15.327 --> 39:19.729
And the acceptance that
we were just beginning.

39:22.694 --> 39:26.194
If I could talk to the first people

39:26.212 --> 39:28.895
to stand on the surface of Mars,

39:29.015 --> 39:31.903
I would ask them to remember

39:31.940 --> 39:34.285
that everything they're about to see,

39:34.899 --> 39:37.624
they'll be seeing for our whole species,

39:37.925 --> 39:43.187
they'll be experiencing,
living a dream that

39:43.307 --> 39:47.478
our recent ancestors would
have deemed impossible.

39:47.816 --> 39:50.345
And it's not just
science fiction anymore,

39:50.628 --> 39:53.345
there are people on this
planet right this moment

39:53.465 --> 39:55.515
that are actually planning

39:55.705 --> 39:58.087
and working to perfect

39:58.093 --> 40:01.150
the machinery that's necessary
to make that possible.

40:02.876 --> 40:06.621
_

40:08.450 --> 40:10.212
T-minus 4 minutes.

40:11.010 --> 40:13.159
We've reached a tipping point.

40:14.215 --> 40:16.204
Thousands of years from now,

40:16.585 --> 40:18.095
whatever we become,

40:18.837 --> 40:20.311
whoever we are,

40:20.431 --> 40:22.816
we'll look back at
these next few decades

40:22.936 --> 40:24.529
as the moment in time

40:24.649 --> 40:26.690
that we are moving off this planet

40:26.886 --> 40:28.765
as a multi-planetary species.

40:28.802 --> 40:30.525
VC and DC verify F9

40:30.554 --> 40:32.877
- and Dragon are in startup.
- F9 is in startup.

40:32.997 --> 40:36.069
And SpaceX stands as nothing less

40:36.104 --> 40:38.368
than a massive game changer.

40:39.491 --> 40:41.475
Stage one,
stage two, pressing for flight.

40:41.519 --> 40:43.518
Elon Musk says the only reason

40:43.638 --> 40:47.020
that I have founded this company
is to get human beings to Mars.

40:47.059 --> 40:48.934
LC LD go for launch.

40:49.054 --> 40:52.422
The key
to making Mars economical

40:52.542 --> 40:54.931
is the reusability of rockets.

40:54.975 --> 40:56.385
T-minus 1 minute.

40:56.429 --> 40:58.290
I just don't
think there's any way to have

40:58.300 --> 41:01.551
a self-sustaining Mars
base without reusability.

41:01.732 --> 41:05.136
Getting the cost down
is really fundamental.

41:05.256 --> 41:08.211
If wooden sailing ships in
the old days were not reusable,

41:08.250 --> 41:09.930
I don't think the United
States would exist.

41:09.959 --> 41:11.375
T-minus 30 seconds.

41:11.377 --> 41:13.736
And if they nail this ability

41:13.781 --> 41:16.973
to land a rocket anyway
they want on Earth,

41:17.169 --> 41:19.256
then they can nail doing it on Mars.

41:19.306 --> 41:20.717
T-minus 15.

41:20.837 --> 41:22.709
This flight is a huge deal.

41:22.829 --> 41:25.292
We haven't yet landed the rocket.

41:25.412 --> 41:28.567
So this is gonna be hopefully
our first successful landing.

41:28.901 --> 41:34.353
T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

41:34.473 --> 41:40.625
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

41:41.721 --> 41:43.282
We have lift off.

42:04.096 --> 42:06.208
Vehicle has reached maximum pressure.

42:06.606 --> 42:09.129
Stage one propulsion
is still not working.

42:09.547 --> 42:13.161
Altitude 32 kilometers, speed
at 1 kilometer per second,

42:13.181 --> 42:15.759
down range distance 13 kilometers.

42:45.984 --> 42:48.051
Space is defined by the strange

42:48.056 --> 42:51.710
relationship between
failure, risk, and innovation.

42:52.669 --> 42:54.341
Which is you can take risks,

42:54.372 --> 42:56.668
you can try something very innovative,

42:57.626 --> 42:59.799
but you're more likely to fail.

43:02.476 --> 43:05.637
Some people say that
the challenges of a Mars mission

43:05.757 --> 43:07.989
are excessively formidable.

43:08.431 --> 43:10.487
I entirely disagree.

43:10.898 --> 43:15.031
I believe that far from being
the weak link in the chain,

43:15.343 --> 43:17.504
human ingenuity, and the human psyche

43:17.539 --> 43:19.844
is gonna be the strongest
link in the chain.

43:21.016 --> 43:23.201
There's a
segment of people in this world

43:23.214 --> 43:25.037
that live on the edge.

43:25.755 --> 43:30.273
The talent of these people
is evaluating the risk

43:30.819 --> 43:33.127
and always the rewards.

43:34.772 --> 43:38.708
If you figure that the
reward is worth the risk.

43:40.083 --> 43:41.998
That yeah, it's risky,

43:42.227 --> 43:45.437
I know I could get killed doing this,

43:46.229 --> 43:50.028
but it's doing something
that man had not done before.

43:52.220 --> 43:55.003
So is it worth it? Mhm, it's worth it.

44:04.824 --> 44:06.899
Mission control confirmed the rover

44:06.919 --> 44:09.503
is 2000 kilos over maximum payload

44:09.545 --> 44:11.271
with all of us aboard.

44:12.210 --> 44:13.806
I ran the numbers,

44:13.836 --> 44:16.329
the odds are we won't make it.

44:24.728 --> 44:26.115
Yeah,

44:28.970 --> 44:30.720
but someone will.

44:33.077 --> 44:34.759
Come on...

44:44.519 --> 44:46.171
Let's get to work.

44:49.958 --> 44:53.169
We had 75 kilometers ahead of us.

44:54.458 --> 44:56.092
Over brutal terrain,

44:56.116 --> 44:59.259
and a rover thousands
of kilos over capacity.

45:02.329 --> 45:04.055
Even if we made it that far,

45:04.079 --> 45:05.816
our new base camp was a workshop

45:05.847 --> 45:07.566
that would barely hold us all.

45:11.814 --> 45:13.644
Temperatures would drop to minus

45:13.662 --> 45:16.136
70 degrees before nightfall,

45:18.775 --> 45:20.814
and the only help we had

45:22.036 --> 45:23.945
was somewhere up there

45:24.614 --> 45:26.781
on a little blue dot.
