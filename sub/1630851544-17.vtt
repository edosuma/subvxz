00:01.871 --> 00:03.699
<i>Previously on SWAT...</i><i>
Eduardo Ortiz. He pled</i>

00:03.742 --> 00:05.788
guilty, so he's not eligible
for an appeal.

00:05.831 --> 00:07.050
Do you mind
if I take a look at this?

00:07.094 --> 00:08.617
Why let half a
law school degree

00:08.660 --> 00:10.184
go to waste
when I can put it to some use?

00:10.227 --> 00:12.055
Overturning a plea deal
is nearly impossible.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.753
Yes. <i>Nearly</i> impossible.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.364
We both know this has
been weighing on you,

00:16.407 --> 00:18.235
and we have a real chance
to do something here.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.629
It's just...
Sometimes I wonder

00:20.672 --> 00:24.154
if it's truly possible
to-to right a wrong.

00:24.198 --> 00:26.548
Well, let's find out together.

00:27.723 --> 00:30.030
This exercise
will test multiple skills

00:30.073 --> 00:31.509
from your SWAT
Academy training.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.207
20 targets

00:33.250 --> 00:35.644
spread across four rooms.
Should we rely

00:35.687 --> 00:37.472
on primary or secondary, sir?
First ten,

00:37.515 --> 00:39.039
use your primary, then swap.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.649
Reload your secondary once. Preference

00:40.692 --> 00:42.477
- on when?
- When you think you need to.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.957
Means they're gonna be
all judgy about it.

00:45.001 --> 00:48.048
That's what we're here for.
All right, who's up first?

00:49.484 --> 00:51.616
Yeah. Officer Zoe Powell,

00:51.660 --> 00:54.054
come on down. Okay,
mind your accuracy.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.447
Don't forget to keep moving.
Speed counts, all right?

00:56.491 --> 00:58.101
Three,

00:58.145 --> 00:59.711
two...

01:01.844 --> 01:03.846
Okay, look, assess
when we arrive on the scene.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.152
Move out. Let's go.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.283
Hurry up,
let's go. Move out.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.988
- What was this thing?
- Oil derrick.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.078
Must've had a systems failure
or something.

01:18.121 --> 01:19.427
STREET:Looks like the apartment
building took the brunt of it.

01:19.470 --> 01:20.950
Fowler, grab your Medi Kit.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.125
I'll get a triage
area going.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.345
26-David at Sixth and Belden.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.521
There's been an accident.
Oil well exploded.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.262
- Need emergency response.
- Tatum, set up

01:28.305 --> 01:29.698
- a perimeter.
- Yes, sir.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.091
Watch the buildings
for signs of collapse!

01:31.134 --> 01:32.701
Go. You guys got to get away.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.616
Come on. Stay clear.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.405
Hey, sir. Can you hear me?

01:41.449 --> 01:43.538
We need to get you out of
here. Got a leg injury.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.583
Possible fracture.
Got to get him out

01:45.627 --> 01:47.150
before the ceiling comes down.
Help! Is someone there?

01:47.194 --> 01:48.891
- Help!
- Sounds like someone's trapped.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.154
Powell! Powell, wait!

01:52.547 --> 01:54.766
Here! I'm up here!

01:54.810 --> 01:57.943
I got you.

02:00.511 --> 02:02.034
You okay?

02:02.078 --> 02:04.167
I'm Zoe.
I'm a police officer.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.647
- What's your name?
- Nina.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.519
I... The whole building shook.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.042
Couldn't get away.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.132
I got a woman with a head injury
on the roof.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.437
Stairwell's blocked.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.222
We got to go.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.572
If she's stable,
we can request a bag for a jump.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.922
Should be about 20 minutes.
No, we don't have that time.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.837
The roof is unstable.
It's gonna collapse.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.926
Hang tight right here.

02:25.232 --> 02:28.322
I need ground rope support.
We're coming down now.

02:29.540 --> 02:32.152
Focus on me. I got you.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.246
We're here.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.117
We're coming
down. Let's go.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.951
Victim's on the way!
Coming down!

02:50.039 --> 02:51.823
Focus on me.
You're going down.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.138
You're all right.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.315
We got you. It's all right.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.926
Keep her coming.
You're okay. You're good.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.015
You're good. Okay. Come on.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.280
You got her?
I got her.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.629
I got you. I got
- you. Let's go.
- All right.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.631
Rope's free, Powell!

03:22.680 --> 03:24.769
Coming down fast.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.990
Get clear!

03:35.519 --> 03:37.304
Nice work. But next time,

03:37.347 --> 03:39.044
- wait for orders.
- And backup.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.177
Roger. Thanks for the assist.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.182
Hey.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.663
Eduardo Ortiz,
this is my wife, Annie Kay.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.926
She has pulled some
of your court filings,

03:50.969 --> 03:52.928
and she's been studying
your case notes with me.

03:52.971 --> 03:56.410
- You a lawyer, ma'am?
- Just a former law student, I'm afraid.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.847
DEACON:But she is very familiar
with your case. Couldn't get

03:58.890 --> 04:00.414
a better set of eyes on this.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.503
I...

04:02.546 --> 04:03.852
I don't understand.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.419
You found my alibi.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.725
- You can prove I'm innocent.
- An old drug dealer

04:07.769 --> 04:09.379
isn't the best witness.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.033
And even if she was,

04:11.076 --> 04:13.644
the real problem is
still the plea deal.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.820
It's-it's not like a verdict.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.561
It can't be overturned
with new evidence.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.302
We have to completely negate it.
And we start that

04:19.346 --> 04:21.304
by looking for new suspects.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.219
I was studying
the interrogation transcripts

04:23.263 --> 04:25.352
from six years ago,
and I had a question

04:25.395 --> 04:27.484
- about the victim, Maria Lozano.
- ORTIZ:I didn't

04:27.528 --> 04:29.051
know her.

04:29.094 --> 04:32.228
I really just did some
repair work around her house.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.708
When LAPD first brought you in,

04:33.751 --> 04:35.971
you said that while you were
at her house,

04:36.014 --> 04:37.320
Maria took a phone call,

04:37.364 --> 04:39.017
and she seemed agitated afterwards.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.671
Do you remember the call

04:40.715 --> 04:43.848
- or what she said?
- It-it was about her job.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.502
Also, maybe a guy.

04:45.546 --> 04:49.114
And she started off talking
about an office transfer.

04:49.158 --> 04:52.248
Cops shut me down
- when I mentioned it.
It's probably

04:52.292 --> 04:54.076
because it didn't fit
their theory of the crime.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.513
Here. Two months
before she died,

04:56.557 --> 04:57.993
Maria switched departments
at work.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.386
She was promoted?
No.

04:59.429 --> 05:00.735
She went
from sales representative

05:00.778 --> 05:02.737
to assistant accountant.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.653
Took a pay cut, so that's odd.

05:05.696 --> 05:08.960
Doesn't sound like a big deal.
Important enough

05:09.004 --> 05:10.875
that someone made a phone call
to Maria's house.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.573
Maybe she was
being harassed?

05:12.616 --> 05:14.139
Tried to get away

05:14.183 --> 05:15.445
from some jerk
that wouldn't leave her alone?

05:15.489 --> 05:16.620
I mean,
that could lead to motive.

05:16.664 --> 05:17.404
Sound like a possibility

05:17.447 --> 05:19.101
to you?

05:20.537 --> 05:23.888
Colder cases have been solved
by people wondering about less.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.500
I'm on call, um,

05:26.543 --> 05:27.979
but in the meantime,
Annie and I

05:28.023 --> 05:29.981
can go contact Maria's
old HR department.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.592
If someone was
bothering her at work,

05:31.635 --> 05:33.550
maybe she filed
a complaint,

05:33.594 --> 05:36.640
and if that's the case,
we get a name.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.251
Maybe a new suspect.

05:40.252 --> 05:41.993
Yeah.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.386
Like we said on the phone,

05:43.430 --> 05:45.475
we're curious if Maria ever had

05:45.519 --> 05:47.825
an issue with someone
- in her department.
- I checked,

05:47.869 --> 05:49.479
and it doesn't look
like she made any complaints,

05:49.523 --> 05:51.002
harassment or otherwise.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.395
Could she have had an issue

05:52.439 --> 05:54.528
- that she didn't formally report?
- Possibly,

05:54.571 --> 05:57.052
but we are strict
about enforcing our policy,

05:57.095 --> 05:59.533
- and our employees know it.
- It was a smaller paycheck

05:59.576 --> 06:01.448
and a less prestigious position.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.841
I mean, there must've been
a reason that she changed jobs.

06:03.885 --> 06:06.366
Mostly, I think she just wanted
to go work for Scott Harmon.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.715
They were friends?

06:07.758 --> 06:09.543
He let her come in
late, leave early,

06:09.586 --> 06:12.241
basically do
- whatever she wanted. Well,

06:12.284 --> 06:13.677
if Scott knew Maria well,
it would be useful

06:13.721 --> 06:15.375
- to talk with him.
- Scott actually left

06:15.418 --> 06:16.985
the company last year.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.856
I have his forwarding info
in the back somewhere.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.641
That'd be great.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.773
- Yeah.
- Uh, could we get a copy of Maria's employee file?

06:22.817 --> 06:24.427
I'm not really supposed
- to do that.
Please?

06:24.471 --> 06:26.951
Maria doesn't have any family
in L.A.,

06:26.995 --> 06:28.997
and this record
would be the clearest picture

06:29.040 --> 06:30.607
we have of her real life

06:30.651 --> 06:32.740
and could help bring
her real killer to justice.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.568
Okay.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.570
Just don't get me into trouble.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.310
- No.
- Definitely won't.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.926
Oh, it's a good thing we
took two cars. I got to go.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.015
There's been an accident near
the SWAT Academy training site.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.757
Listen, we need to know
who called Maria that day

06:49.800 --> 06:52.063
and what made her upset, so
you good to wait for that file?

06:52.107 --> 06:53.848
Yeah, whatever
- the investigation needs.
- Okay.

06:53.891 --> 06:55.763
- Okay.
- Bye.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.113
Head contusion.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.028
She's disoriented,
possibly concussed.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.117
So, what do you say,
teach? Back to class,

07:02.160 --> 07:03.379
or can the kids play hooky?

07:03.423 --> 07:04.946
Once we officially
hand the scene off,

07:04.989 --> 07:06.817
I think we should
reschedule for another day.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.558
Just say the word, Captain.
We'll get out of your hair.

07:08.602 --> 07:09.864
I don't think
it's gonna be that easy.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.343
My team found this
in the rubble.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.823
The timer's gone, but...

07:12.867 --> 07:14.216
It's an incendiary device.

07:14.259 --> 07:15.783
This wasn't an accident.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.741
Thanks.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.003
Okay, 22-David

07:19.047 --> 07:20.570
to Command.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.442
Remains of a bomb have
been found in East L.A.

07:22.485 --> 07:25.488
Well, unfortunately,
it's not a surprise.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.011
I just got word
of two other oil derricks

07:27.055 --> 07:28.404
exploding this morning.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.710
We only heard the one blast.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.276
Well,
the others were across town.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.235
One in K-Town,
the other in Compton.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.366
So it's a coordinated attack.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.020
Manifesto was found in Compton.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.327
Bombers want the world to
see that these oil companies

07:38.370 --> 07:40.938
are poisoning citizens
in the name of profit.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.723
The signature's
just a drawn symbol.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.464
Sounds like they don't want
to be found

07:44.507 --> 07:45.639
- right away.
- Because they're planning to strike again.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.940
19 injuries,
three fatalities so far.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.768
Street and Luca
are headed back now.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.639
The symbol
on the bomber's manifesto

08:29.683 --> 08:31.336
doesn't match any groups
in our database.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.947
What else we got?
Devices were homemade.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.470
Bomb squad's running
a chemical analysis.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.167
The targets
were all oil derricks,

08:36.211 --> 08:37.647
but they belonged
to three separate companies

08:37.691 --> 08:39.519
in different areas of the city.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.172
Then we'd better
up patrol presence

08:41.216 --> 08:42.565
around any other derricks
that might be targeted.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.480
That might be harder
than you think, boss.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.090
These are the active
drill sites in L.A.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.223
Over a thousand in
total. Los Angeles

08:48.266 --> 08:49.920
is the largest active
urban oil field in the country.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.574
I knew there was oil wells

08:51.618 --> 08:53.707
near my block, but I had no idea
there were so many.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.057
And in residential
- neighborhoods, too.
Some of them are decorated

08:56.100 --> 08:57.537
or disguised behind fences.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.929
"Hidden death factories."

08:58.973 --> 09:00.583
That's from the manifesto.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.063
These attacks
are meant to draw attention

09:02.106 --> 09:03.978
to the dangers of oil drilling

09:04.021 --> 09:05.588
so close to where people live
- and work.
They call out

09:05.632 --> 09:07.111
health issues
from airborne toxins,

09:07.155 --> 09:09.679
the potential of chemical spills
or gas leaks.

09:09.723 --> 09:10.941
And how majority of
the drilling happens

09:10.985 --> 09:12.595
in or near low-income
communities,

09:12.639 --> 09:14.292
where complaints are more
likely to go unheard.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.816
Setting off explosives

09:15.859 --> 09:18.166
is a funny way
of keeping neighborhoods safe.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.254
Even if we only
looked at derricks

09:19.297 --> 09:20.777
in underprivileged areas,

09:20.821 --> 09:22.344
that's still hundreds
of potential targets.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.085
We'll never be able

09:24.128 --> 09:25.826
to narrow it down in time.
All right, we may not know

09:25.869 --> 09:27.610
where they're headed,
but we know where they've been.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.699
Let's pull security records
from this morning's targets.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.919
If there's something there
we can use to ID the bombers,

09:31.962 --> 09:33.921
we might be able to stop
their next attack.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.575
So, the bomb squad

09:35.618 --> 09:37.620
tells us that the IEDs
from this morning's attack

09:37.664 --> 09:39.274
used ammonium nitrate
in welded steel.

09:39.317 --> 09:40.623
Yeah, nothing fancy.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.190
In any bomb,
there are two components.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.061
You got fuel and trigger.
Can you dismantle

09:44.105 --> 09:45.672
the trigger?
If you get close enough.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.195
But when you can't,
that's where this gal

09:47.238 --> 09:48.805
comes in.
Fire it properly,

09:48.849 --> 09:50.459
it severs the trigger

09:50.502 --> 09:51.547
and interrupts the chemical
reaction before it happens.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.853
It must need to be

09:52.896 --> 09:53.984
pretty close range. Nah.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.377
Max should be
about ten meters.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.553
Detective Burrows.
You here about our bomber?

09:57.597 --> 10:00.208
Uh, no, I'll leave
hunting terrorists to SWAT.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.689
Uh, Deac,
could I get a private word?

10:02.732 --> 10:04.604
Sure.
Catch you, bro.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.655
RHD knows you're asking around

10:12.699 --> 10:14.744
about the Eduardo
Ortiz case.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.138
It's not a secret.

10:17.181 --> 10:19.662
I pulled that file
from your archives weeks ago.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.533
Well, it's one thing
to read a file.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.579
It's another thing to start
questioning the investigation,

10:23.623 --> 10:26.364
go putting a conviction
- in doubt.
- So you came down here

10:26.408 --> 10:28.453
to tell me what,
I'm ruffling feathers?

10:28.497 --> 10:30.194
You and your wife.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.675
I'm trying to be the
friendly face saying it here.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.590
Saying what?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.287
That your detectives
are so fragile,

10:36.331 --> 10:38.550
they can't stand to have
their work double-checked?

10:38.594 --> 10:40.161
Ortiz wanted the girl,

10:40.204 --> 10:42.467
she turned him down,
he went back and killed her.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.079
RHD pursued a lead
and ID'd him as a suspect.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.081
He admitted guilt
when he took the plea deal.

10:47.124 --> 10:49.692
- We did our jobs.
- Mm-hmm. I did my job, too.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.955
I put the cuffs on Ortiz
six years ago.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.044
Doesn't mean we got it right.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.831
RHD missed something back then.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.224
The phone call the victim took
the day she died.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.923
Hey, as police officers,

11:02.966 --> 11:04.707
we hold lives in our hands,

11:04.751 --> 11:07.449
and we have to be held
to a higher standard.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.973
We should be inviting reexamination,

11:10.017 --> 11:11.496
- not fighting it.
- But if everything

11:11.540 --> 11:12.933
is always open
to reinterpretation,

11:12.976 --> 11:14.935
how can a victim's family
ever feel closure?

11:14.978 --> 11:17.285
How can anyone have faith
in the justice system?

11:17.328 --> 11:18.721
It's a human system,

11:18.765 --> 11:20.244
and it's flawed.

11:20.288 --> 11:24.205
Justice is seeing that
and making it right.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.991
I don't think Ortiz
killed Maria Lozano.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.863
- So, what's your theory?
- I'm still working on it.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.821
With my wife.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.431
All right.

11:33.475 --> 11:36.173
Hey, Ed. I'm not asking you

11:36.217 --> 11:37.653
to redo the case.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.959
But if we get a lead,

11:39.002 --> 11:40.525
- will you act on it?
- If you come up

11:40.569 --> 11:43.528
with something legit, of course.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.792
I'm just saying I think
you're wasting your time.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.928
Drill site security tapes
from this morning are a no-go.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.583
Cameras were all damaged
or destroyed in the explosions.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.019
I think I got something.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.804
Uh, patrol officers
responded to a call

11:57.847 --> 11:59.196
at the Compton site a month ago.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.676
Picked up these guys.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.156
Peter Watson and Cole Briggs.

12:02.199 --> 12:03.766
They were caught
sneaking around the derricks.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.681
Could've been a scouting trip,
testing security

12:05.725 --> 12:07.770
and figuring out
- where to place the bomb.
Arrest records say

12:07.814 --> 12:09.076
they were both wearing T-shirts

12:09.119 --> 12:10.425
advertising
the Integrity Network.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.643
It's a protest group.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.558
Now, I don't see
the manifesto symbol

12:13.602 --> 12:15.343
anywhere on their social media,

12:15.386 --> 12:17.693
but they're hard-core anti-oil.
Watson's the cofounder.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.782
With quite the rap sheet.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.350
Tagging oil wells with graffiti,
harassing drill crews,

12:22.393 --> 12:24.221
assaulting oil execs.
He still has

12:24.265 --> 12:26.180
an outstanding felony warrant,
and he's escalating.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.530
Watson wants to be heard.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.706
And a series of bombings gets
- the message out loud and clear. Okay,

12:30.750 --> 12:32.316
ID as many members
in the Integrity Network

12:32.360 --> 12:33.796
as you can. We need
to find them now.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.408
Yeah. Yeah.
I heard you the third time.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.672
Press is hungry
for the manifesto.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.674
I'm holding them off for now.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.372
Sir, giving these bombers
attention, it's risky.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.461
- Could make them act faster.
- Agreed. Well...

12:46.504 --> 12:48.419
- Commander Hicks.
- Councilwoman Gokey.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.944
I wasn't aware
- we had a meeting today.
We don't.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.989
But I've been told
that SWAT's in charge

12:53.033 --> 12:55.122
of stopping these terrorists
intent on blowing up

12:55.165 --> 12:57.298
every oil well in Los Angeles.
This is Sergeant Harrelson.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.474
His team's running point.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.258
Well, then you can tell me
why no one's reached out

13:01.302 --> 13:03.260
to my district
about protecting the derricks

13:03.304 --> 13:04.609
- on our streets.
- Councilwoman.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.916
There's hundreds
of potential targets.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.614
Even if putting officers at
every one of them were possible,

13:09.658 --> 13:12.356
it would spread us out so thin,
- we'd be useless.
And is that

13:12.400 --> 13:14.315
what you're telling everyone?
Or is LAPD

13:14.358 --> 13:17.100
rustling up the manpower
to defend Brentwood?

13:17.144 --> 13:19.494
Money doesn't buy special
treatment with SWAT.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.365
What block are you from?

13:21.409 --> 13:23.280
Lincoln Heights.
South L.A.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.630
I know what it feels like
watching other neighborhoods

13:25.674 --> 13:27.676
have their problems get fixed
while yours just get worse.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.025
That's why I'm here.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.592
I'm not about to let
my constituents

13:30.635 --> 13:32.202
become an afterthought.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.944
If I have to raise hell
with the mayor, I will.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.033
And I respect that.
But the best way

13:37.077 --> 13:39.079
to prevent another attack
is to find these bombers

13:39.122 --> 13:40.297
before they strike again.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.473
Councilwoman,
let us do our jobs.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.824
We're all on the same team.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.696
I'll trust you. For now.

13:47.739 --> 13:50.177
But I will be back
for an update.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.662
Hey. You back
from the hospital?

13:57.706 --> 13:59.882
How's the woman
- Powell saved?
- Nina?

13:59.926 --> 14:02.058
CT scan revealed
internal bleeding.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.494
She's in emergency surgery.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.061
I'd like the chance to explain.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.758
I wasn't being reckless.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.457
You went charging off into
a collapsing building alone.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.895
At SWAT, we don't compound
one tragedy with another.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.897
Take the critique, Officer.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.899
And next time,
look to your leaders

14:16.943 --> 14:19.641
for the plan
and then execute it together.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.991
Due respect, I saved a life.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.340
I didn't need anyone

14:23.384 --> 14:24.907
to tell me how to do it.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.648
Watch yourself.
I know

14:26.691 --> 14:29.564
what I'm capable of,
and they didn't.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.394
Do you want to be SWAT?

14:35.396 --> 14:38.834
- Yes, sir.
- Then lose the arrogance, Powell.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.577
Before something in this job
humbles you hard.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.368
ID'd another Integrity Network

14:51.412 --> 14:52.935
member, Javier Velasco.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.763
Our unis paid visits
to Watson's home and work,

14:54.806 --> 14:56.504
but he wasn't around.
Ditto with Briggs and Velasco.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.332
So, three
Integrity Network members

14:58.375 --> 14:59.855
suddenly change
their daily routines?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.552
That's not a coincidence.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.032
They're probably together,
prepping the next attack.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.468
But they don't have
a known meeting spot,

15:04.512 --> 15:05.817
and their phones are turned off.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.210
Yeah, but they've had them on
in the past.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.820
Pull up
their cell histories,

15:08.864 --> 15:10.257
see which tower
their phones pinged the most

15:10.300 --> 15:11.345
in the last three months.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.434
That's Watson.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.436
These are the other two.

15:15.479 --> 15:16.741
That's the one. Downtown.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.178
That signal range covers retail,

15:18.221 --> 15:19.788
apartments.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.442
Do any of them have any
property in the area?

15:21.485 --> 15:22.356
Not that I can see.
Look at this restaurant.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.097
Velasco's. Same name.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.707
Betting that's a family joint.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.839
Four and a half stars.
Not a bad spot to hide out.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.798
Have the nearest patrol car
sit on it until we get there.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.278
Let's move.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.414
Patrol spotted
Watson's car out front.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.112
We got to be careful
with these guys.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.461
We don't know
how dangerous they are.

15:40.504 --> 15:41.810
The place has a private room.
Most likely,

15:41.853 --> 15:43.464
the Integrity Network's
meeting in there.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.644
Whoa, whoa. They're here.

15:49.687 --> 15:50.732
- Cops!
- Huh?

15:50.775 --> 15:51.951
Hey, LAPD!

15:51.994 --> 15:53.343
- Oh, no.
- LUCA:Hands!

15:53.387 --> 15:54.605
Stop where you are!
LAPD!

15:54.649 --> 15:55.737
We got rabbits.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.434
- Hey, no, no!
- Do not move!

15:57.478 --> 15:59.654
Down! Hands behind your back!

15:59.697 --> 16:00.655
26-David.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.396
Two suspects in custody.

16:03.614 --> 16:04.833
Come here!

16:07.227 --> 16:09.011
Hands! Hands!

16:10.012 --> 16:11.144
Third suspect in custody.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.974
LAPD!

16:16.105 --> 16:17.889
They're doubling back
through the restaurant.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.501
I'm headed your way.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.505
LAPD. Everybody stay
where you are.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.507
Chris, take the kitchen!

16:27.899 --> 16:29.379
Hey. Hey.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.994
24-David.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.691
I got the fourth one.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.090
Get down.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.526
Where are the explosives?

16:45.569 --> 16:47.180
- I know who did it.
- Answer the question.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.398
None of us had anything to do
with the bombings,

16:48.442 --> 16:49.747
but we know who did.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.278
So it wasn't you, but
you know who bombed

16:58.321 --> 16:59.409
the drill sites this
morning, and you decided

16:59.453 --> 17:00.541
not to call
the cops because...?

17:00.584 --> 17:02.456
Well, I don't know their names.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.240
This is just noise. We showed up
and he took off like a rocket.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.199
The second I heard
about the bombings,

17:06.242 --> 17:08.375
I knew the cops would think the
Integrity Network was involved.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.029
You scouting out the Compton
drill site a month ago

17:10.072 --> 17:11.639
doesn't look good.

17:11.682 --> 17:14.033
That was us filming.
We are making a documentary

17:14.076 --> 17:15.643
about the L.A. derricks.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.079
We're trying
to raise awareness

17:17.123 --> 17:20.343
and save people, not hurt them.

17:20.387 --> 17:23.172
All right, talk to me about
these no-name bombing suspects.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.653
The Integrity Network
does on-campus recruiting

17:25.696 --> 17:28.047
for our projects
to get volunteers.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.440
A couple weeks ago,
these four guys show up.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.790
Older and madder.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.879
Mad at you? You're already
protesting the oil companies.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.925
Well, apparently,
not enough.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.709
After my speech,
one of the guys hijacked the mic

17:38.753 --> 17:40.102
and went off
about us being weak.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.409
- He advocate for violence?
- Well, he said

17:42.452 --> 17:45.064
that the wells will never
be shut down voluntarily,

17:45.107 --> 17:46.500
and in order to really stop
the drilling,

17:46.543 --> 17:48.197
we have to take them out.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.810
We didn't find any explosives

17:52.854 --> 17:54.682
or planning materials on the
Integrity Network members here.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.901
Not saying that I believe
Watson just yet,

17:56.945 --> 17:58.686
but we should check
into these guys.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.079
We still need a name.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.387
You documentary guys
film everything.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.476
Did you tape the recruiting
session these guys crashed?

18:06.520 --> 18:07.869
Yes.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.610
We're gonna want a look
at that footage.

18:10.611 --> 18:11.786
Hi.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.048
Okay, so, I wasn't able

18:13.092 --> 18:14.789
to contact Maria's
coworker Scott,

18:14.832 --> 18:17.313
but I think I found something
in her employee file.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.794
I'm good, thank you.
How are you?

18:19.837 --> 18:21.796
Hi.

18:21.839 --> 18:24.668
I heard the explosion
wasn't just an accident.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.235
Yeah. It's keeping us busy,
that's for sure.

18:26.279 --> 18:27.976
So, what'd you find?

18:28.019 --> 18:30.631
I definitely know that Maria
and Scott weren't just friends.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.589
Take a look at her
expense reports.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.723
Hotel rooms, dining in for two.
And he signed off on all of it.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.159
- They <i>were</i> having an affair.
- Yeah,

18:37.203 --> 18:38.639
and a hot and heavy one,
by the looks of it.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.031
Scott was married at the time.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.990
What if she threatened
to tell his wife?

18:42.033 --> 18:43.296
But the police report said
that she was strangled

18:43.339 --> 18:44.906
and hidden in a pantry.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.256
That's easier than coming clean
with your spouse?

18:47.300 --> 18:49.606
Scott Harmon wasn't exactly
a wayward romantic,

18:49.650 --> 18:51.260
caught up in his feelings.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.871
I ran his name, and he's got
a history of violence.

18:53.915 --> 18:56.222
There was an old domestic abuse
charge that was dismissed

18:56.265 --> 18:58.311
during his college days,
and then a few years

18:58.354 --> 19:00.704
after Maria's death,
his wife filed for divorce.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.706
She also filed a
restraining order.

19:02.750 --> 19:06.536
I am glad that he didn't answer
the phone when I called.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.799
Okay, so, uh, now what?

19:08.843 --> 19:11.062
Well, it's just a theory.
The LAPD's not gonna interview

19:11.106 --> 19:13.543
Scott Harmon unless
we bring them something legit.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.937
We should talk to the ex-wife.
I mean, maybe Cora remembers him

19:15.980 --> 19:17.895
- acting strange back then.
- Okay.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.810
Yeah, we can visit her
this weekend on my day off.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.726
Annie,

19:22.770 --> 19:24.946
it's a closed case,
there's no rush.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.774
I-I know, but my parents
have the kids and I'm free.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.819
I-I just feel like
we're on to something.

19:28.863 --> 19:32.345
Maybe I should keep
the momentum going.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.563
Please?

19:33.607 --> 19:34.999
Fine.

19:38.351 --> 19:39.917
We suspect our bombers
made contact

19:39.961 --> 19:41.528
with another activist group,
and we're working

19:41.571 --> 19:43.225
- to get IDs.
- And you'll get them

19:43.269 --> 19:45.227
before they can plant
- another bomb?
- Any officer

19:45.271 --> 19:47.838
who promises that
isn't a good cop.

19:47.882 --> 19:51.233
What I can say is
is we're making progress.

19:51.277 --> 19:54.018
Good. Thank you, gentlemen.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.106
Mm-hmm.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.419
Councilwoman.

20:03.463 --> 20:04.899
Can I get a minute?

20:08.032 --> 20:09.251
It feels like
these activists

20:09.295 --> 20:10.513
have a point.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.820
Drilling sites near
where people live.

20:12.863 --> 20:16.476
They pollute the air 24/7,
and people get sick.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.174
Not to mention
the possibility of accidents.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.350
Los Angeles has a long history
with oil.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.222
Some of our wells were
first tapped in the '40s,

20:23.265 --> 20:25.398
before anyone thought
to regulate them.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.443
But places like Beverly Hills
lobbied for safety measures.

20:27.487 --> 20:31.578
Added filtration systems,
increased testing and security.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.493
- That's true.
- You came in here

20:33.536 --> 20:35.756
wanting to know what LAPD was
doing to protect your district,

20:35.799 --> 20:37.801
calling out privileged behavior.

20:37.845 --> 20:41.065
All due respect, I have to
challenge you on the same thing.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.154
What's the city council doing
to push oil companies

20:43.198 --> 20:46.288
for updates
in neighborhoods like ours?

20:46.332 --> 20:48.116
That's a fair question, Sergeant.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.944
If any good can come
out of these attacks today,

20:49.987 --> 20:51.641
I hope it's that.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.426
My constituents are riled up.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.558
Maybe I can leverage
their interest into something.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.652
That Watson's
documentary footage?

21:02.696 --> 21:04.045
Yeah, I've been going
through the video.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.874
What you're doing doesn't work.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.485
I failed Noah
for years like this.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.139
- Who's Noah?
- Not sure.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.489
He's never mentioned again.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.622
Stop acting like you're more
- than just bystanders.
- He seems to be the leader,

21:15.665 --> 21:17.841
and gets up and goes off,
just like Watson said.

21:17.885 --> 21:20.670
It doesn't mean he's
connected to the bombing.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.020
They will never shut
the wells down themselves.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.239
Wait a sec.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.936
Zoom in.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.809
That patch matches
the drawing on the manifesto.

21:28.852 --> 21:32.378
This guy <i>is</i> connected
to the bombing.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.510
This view isn't strong enough
to run facial recognition,

21:34.554 --> 21:36.556
but I don't see much else
to ID the guy with.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.688
Watson does have
one more file from this day.

21:38.732 --> 21:41.256
The oil companies,
the mood has shifted,

21:41.300 --> 21:43.650
and the Integrity Network
is gonna keep that change going.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.347
Must be after the event.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.218
...the naysayers,
because everything they say...

21:47.262 --> 21:48.481
Look, in the background.

21:48.524 --> 21:49.656
That's the same guy.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.353
He's getting in a car.
Black Ford.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.442
If Velasco would just move,
we could see the plate.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.139
Come on, come on.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.402
The wells...

21:56.445 --> 21:58.360
Partial.
That's all we're gonna get.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.667
I'll run it against the
database, see what pops back.

22:04.235 --> 22:06.194
DEACON:Hey.
Hey.

22:06.237 --> 22:07.543
Chris and Tan got a plate.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.371
Should have an ID
on a new suspect soon.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.851
Great.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.461
Listen, I, uh...

22:12.505 --> 22:16.030
I kind of overheard Hicks
talking to Powell earlier.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.423
Let me guess, she wasn't
happy about my report

22:17.466 --> 22:19.338
- from this morning.
- I take it the...

22:19.381 --> 22:21.862
the whole attitude problem
is a regular thing.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.864
I'm surprised you guys
haven't cut her.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.344
Yeah, well, we may have to. Next
chopping block is coming up.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.519
Thing is, she's good.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.303
Solid instincts.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.522
I can't figure out
where she picked up

22:29.565 --> 22:31.219
half the skills she's got.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.655
Yeah, but if she thinks the
procedure is holding her back,

22:32.699 --> 22:33.961
she's just gonna ignore it
and do what she wants.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.179
If she keeps up

22:35.223 --> 22:36.224
this lone wolf attitude,

22:36.267 --> 22:38.182
we're gonna have to lose her.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.662
Dude, why are
you laughing?

22:39.706 --> 22:41.229
We're just trying
to make her a great officer.

22:41.272 --> 22:43.840
No, I know, I know. It's
just, this is so weird,

22:43.884 --> 22:46.103
to see from the other side.

22:46.147 --> 22:49.237
Powell is me. Like, the old me.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.545
When I first
joined 20-Squad.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.460
I think Hondo gave me
the whole lone wolf speech

22:54.503 --> 22:56.157
every day for a month.
He did.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.377
That's right,
I'd almost forgotten that.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.162
Yeah, 'cause Street's such
a model of respectability now.

23:01.205 --> 23:04.774
Well, I like to think that
I've focused my wild side.

23:04.818 --> 23:08.125
But you know what?
I think Powell can, too.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.649
You just look at her
this morning.

23:09.692 --> 23:12.478
She's obviously passionate.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.828
She's just a little rough
around the edges.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.439
Problem is, nothing we do
gets through to her.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.962
Yeah.

23:19.006 --> 23:20.573
What finally worked on you?

23:21.574 --> 23:23.271
I'm not sure.

23:23.314 --> 23:27.231
Bomber could strike again
anytime, anywhere in the city.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.319
Is this our guy?

23:28.363 --> 23:29.582
Jacob Lambert.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.235
We found similar wording
to the manifesto

23:31.279 --> 23:32.541
in his recent
social media posts.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.151
Lot of hate for
the oil companies.

23:34.195 --> 23:36.023
He blames them for the
death of someone named Noah.

23:36.066 --> 23:38.286
Still looking into it, but
Lambert posts a lot of articles

23:38.329 --> 23:40.462
about the cancer risks of
living near an oil well.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.682
Well, which makes this
a vengeance mission.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.988
Yeah, one he's been
on for a while.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.468
Rap sheet's full
of property destruction charges.

23:46.512 --> 23:47.991
Keeps trying to sabotage
oil derricks.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.123
This guy's disillusioned

23:49.166 --> 23:50.864
and certainly dangerous,

23:50.907 --> 23:52.474
but we're gonna need something
more concrete to get a warrant.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.389
I pulled Lambert's financials.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.913
Two weeks ago, he made a large
purchase at a hardware store.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.349
Called them to get
an itemized receipt,

23:58.393 --> 23:59.438
they just sent it over.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.657
Some welding equipment.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.006
And Turfstrong.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.269
That's a high-nitrogen
fertilizer.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.532
Break down the fertilizer,
and you can extract

24:06.575 --> 24:08.142
- ammonium nitrate.
- Yeah.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.360
Bomb squad said that's the base
of the explosives

24:09.404 --> 24:10.492
used on the oil derricks.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.494
He's got a house in the Valley.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.930
All right, I'll get
the paperwork in order.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.802
Get 20-Squad
ready to roll.

24:22.243 --> 24:24.375
Patrol's got a perimeter set up.
I don't want Lambert

24:24.419 --> 24:25.855
or any of his guys slipping us.
Let's move.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.992
Drone's coming over.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.255
Infrared's not
picking up anyone.

24:34.298 --> 24:35.604
Lambert and his crew
aren't here.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.171
Maybe already planting
the next bomb.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.389
Could've left
planning materials,

24:38.433 --> 24:39.434
might tell us
where they're headed.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.653
Hold up.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.002
There's a device
at the front door.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.699
I got another one
on the front window.

24:43.743 --> 24:46.310
Lambert could've booby-trapped
every entrance.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.703
Bomb squad's dealing
with a situation down in Venice.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.139
Deacon, can you disable one,
get us inside?

24:49.183 --> 24:50.445
It'll take time we don't have.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.102
I've got an idea.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.147
You can have a seat right here.

24:57.191 --> 24:58.540
Thanks.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.281
Uh, so Cora,
I just wanted to verify

25:00.324 --> 25:01.891
some things about
your ex-husband,

25:01.935 --> 25:03.545
- if that's okay.
- Okay.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.634
I haven't seen him in years.

25:05.678 --> 25:08.419
I take it he's causing problems
for someone new?

25:08.463 --> 25:10.552
Kind of. Uh, so you were
still married to Scott

25:10.596 --> 25:12.685
as of six years ago, correct?

25:12.728 --> 25:14.730
We were in our downward spiral
years then.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.776
Having terrible fights.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.821
You filed a restraining order
against him.

25:18.865 --> 25:21.694
So Scott could be violent?

25:21.737 --> 25:24.305
He had a temper.
It wasn't pretty.

25:24.348 --> 25:25.524
Do you think it's possible
that he might have been having

25:25.567 --> 25:26.916
an affair back then?

25:26.960 --> 25:30.006
I-I know it's a
really tough question.

25:30.050 --> 25:33.053
Um... I thought
he could have been.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.534
He'd come home late
smelling like perfume.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.796
Did you ever look into it?

25:36.839 --> 25:37.840
By the time I got up
the courage,

25:37.884 --> 25:39.712
it seemed like it was over.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.452
What's all this about?

25:41.496 --> 25:42.932
Uh, well, my husband and I
are looking into the death

25:42.976 --> 25:45.413
of one of Scott's coworkers.
Maria Lozano.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.850
Maria? Uh, yeah.

25:47.894 --> 25:50.374
I had, I had met her
a few times.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.681
Wait, is that who you think

25:52.725 --> 25:54.161
Scott was sleeping with
back then?

25:54.204 --> 25:55.597
Uh, we aren't
a hundred percent...

25:55.641 --> 25:57.599
But you're looking
into her death.

25:57.643 --> 25:58.948
It was something horrible,
right? Wasn't she murdered

25:58.992 --> 26:00.950
and stuffed in a pantry?

26:00.994 --> 26:02.952
- Yes.
- You think Scott

26:02.996 --> 26:04.824
was involved in that?

26:04.867 --> 26:06.608
- Wow.
- We're not sure of anything,

26:06.652 --> 26:10.873
we're just gathering facts
and examining the possibilities.

26:10.917 --> 26:14.050
You said Maria's body
was stuffed in a pantry?

26:14.094 --> 26:16.705
- What?
- You just said that, but that information

26:16.749 --> 26:18.751
wasn't released to the public.

26:18.794 --> 26:21.144
- I don't understand.
- Well, how could you know that?

26:21.188 --> 26:22.711
Unless Scott told you?

26:22.755 --> 26:25.322
- He didn't.
- Or unless you...

26:25.366 --> 26:27.455
How did you know
about the pantry?

26:28.804 --> 26:30.284
- Cora.
- Look,

26:30.327 --> 26:32.112
some Mexican guy confessed
to killing Maria.

26:32.155 --> 26:34.114
That's all
I remember about it.

26:34.157 --> 26:36.595
I'm not sure where I-I heard
about the pantry.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.161
I need to check on something.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.215
Strap is set. We're good to go.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.570
On your count, Luca.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.877
Three, two, one.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.360
All right, check the house.
Watch for any nasty surprises.

27:03.404 --> 27:04.666
Great job, Deac.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.668
- Hey.
- It's Annie.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.365
Something's wrong.

27:08.409 --> 27:09.802
All right,
we got this covered. Go.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.281
Move in.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.423
- You okay?
- Yeah.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.381
Yeah, I'm okay. I-I...
I just bolted out of there.

27:24.425 --> 27:25.861
I wanted to drive away,
but my-my hands

27:25.905 --> 27:27.297
wouldn't start the car.

27:27.341 --> 27:29.778
It's her. She's the killer.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.693
What? Cora?
Tell me what happened.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.564
Okay, we were talking about
Scott, their divorce,

27:33.608 --> 27:35.741
but Cora knew
that he was unfaithful.

27:35.784 --> 27:38.265
She knew that Maria's body
was put in a pantry.

27:38.308 --> 27:40.702
LAPD never released that,
so how could she know that,

27:40.746 --> 27:42.312
unless she did it?

27:42.356 --> 27:44.271
All right, s-she said that?
- Okay, okay.
- Yes.

27:44.314 --> 27:45.881
All right, let's just
think this through, all right?

27:45.925 --> 27:47.230
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.450
Six years ago, RHD,

27:49.493 --> 27:50.930
they didn't know
about Scott's infidelity,

27:50.973 --> 27:52.671
so they didn't have any reason
to question Cora

27:52.714 --> 27:55.282
about the murder,
so they didn't.

27:55.325 --> 27:58.024
I mean, it--
Look, it's possible.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.765
She stopped talking,
she got flustered.

27:59.808 --> 28:00.983
Why would she do that unless
she had something to hide?

28:01.027 --> 28:02.724
All right.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.030
So, we'll take this info
to Burrows,

28:04.073 --> 28:05.640
see what he can get from it.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.598
Okay?

28:07.642 --> 28:08.861
All right, why don't you get
your stuff,

28:08.904 --> 28:10.689
I'll send someone
for the car, okay?

28:15.258 --> 28:16.695
Bedrooms look like
they're in use.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.348
Lambert might have a crew
of three or four guys.

28:18.392 --> 28:21.351
Hey, Lambert's bomb-making
station's in the garage.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.484
Nitrogen distillery,
wires, the works.

28:23.527 --> 28:27.314
He had this tacked up nearby.
I'm thinking this is Noah.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.229
I also found boxes of ammo.
They got more than explosives.

28:29.272 --> 28:31.753
Lambert's committed
to his target, whatever it is.

28:33.799 --> 28:38.238
Nada. Who has a filing cabinet
but doesn't keep anything in it?

28:38.281 --> 28:41.241
Well, someone with
- unconventional files.
- What'd you find?

28:41.284 --> 28:42.982
That's the three companies

28:43.025 --> 28:44.548
whose derricks
Lambert already hit.

28:44.592 --> 28:46.376
Yeah, and about a
half dozen others.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.770
And look, this one's
pretty thick.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.034
Paxner Oil.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.779
This article says that Paxner

28:57.823 --> 28:59.476
promised to reduce emissions
at drill sites.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.740
Yeah, but these are,
uh, internal documents

29:01.783 --> 29:03.829
saying they never really made
any substantial changes.

29:03.872 --> 29:05.265
Too expensive.

29:05.308 --> 29:07.267
"Eyes only, CEO Allen Finley."

29:07.310 --> 29:09.356
Lambert dug into these guys. Hey.

29:09.399 --> 29:10.879
Hypocrites, profit-obsessed.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.881
Paxner Oil checks a lot
of boxes from the manifesto.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.100
They could be the next target.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.495
Turns out Noah Bennett
was Lambert's best friend.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.759
Property records show
he grew up one block over

29:20.802 --> 29:22.369
from a Paxner Oil well.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.763
Diagnosed with leukemia
five years ago,

29:24.806 --> 29:26.199
he died a couple months back.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.722
I'm betting the other guys
in Lambert's crew

29:27.766 --> 29:29.289
knew victims, too.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.639
Explains the wide variety
of companies targeted.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.249
I just got off the
phone with Paxner.

29:33.293 --> 29:35.643
Security swept their
drill sites and offices,

29:35.686 --> 29:37.384
they didn't find any explosives,
but they sent

29:37.427 --> 29:38.951
a list of facilities searched.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.822
Lambert's had plenty of time
to get the bomb in place.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.128
Why delay?

29:42.171 --> 29:43.477
Lambert wants to hold
somebody accountable

29:43.520 --> 29:44.870
for Noah's death.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.697
And that's Paxner's CEO
Allen Finley.

29:46.741 --> 29:48.090
He's the guy who failed to put

29:48.134 --> 29:49.613
the real safety measures
on the wells.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.485
So Lambert's waiting
for Finley to show up

29:51.528 --> 29:53.356
to wherever he planted
his device.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.445
Okay, so where's
- the boss man today?
- Well, memos

29:55.489 --> 29:57.317
call for a meeting
of the board today.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.188
But the person I talked to
said Finley's off-site,

29:59.232 --> 30:01.669
so why meet
off your own property?

30:01.712 --> 30:03.453
'Cause it's gonna be
your property soon.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.716
There were emails that mention
a new derrick acquisition.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.328
- Uh, just no address.
- Okay, I got it.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.896
This is an official map
of Paxner wells.

30:10.939 --> 30:13.333
But check out
Lambert's map, okay?

30:13.376 --> 30:16.771
This is an extra drill site,
right here in this oil field.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.817
That's got to be
Paxner's new property.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.427
And Lambert's next target.

30:20.470 --> 30:21.689
I'll call Paxner's office,

30:21.732 --> 30:22.864
confirm Finley's
headed over there.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.126
Have 20-Squad ready to roll.

30:28.174 --> 30:31.394
Looks more Wild West
than big city.

30:31.438 --> 30:33.048
Paxner's new derrick
is at the top of this ridge.

30:33.092 --> 30:34.876
And if Lambert wants Finley
to be here when it blows,

30:34.920 --> 30:36.269
he's got to be nearby.

30:36.312 --> 30:37.879
He probably already
planted the bomb.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.316
When you spot it, I'll need
that location immediately.

30:46.366 --> 30:47.758
Oh, yeah.

30:47.802 --> 30:49.108
It's an excellent
portfolio addition

30:49.151 --> 30:50.413
for the company.

30:50.457 --> 30:51.414
Go, go, go.
They're here.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.807
Post up.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.156
- Yeah, it totally works.
- I agree.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.158
Got something to say
to you, Finley.

30:56.202 --> 30:57.899
What?

30:57.943 --> 30:59.683
- Street, left side.
- Cops!

31:00.902 --> 31:01.860
26-David. One suspect down.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.297
Okay, I got two headed west.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.081
24-David. We're on it.
Luca, with me.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.606
Now you're gonna hear me out.

31:09.650 --> 31:10.912
LAPD!LAPD!

31:10.956 --> 31:12.044
LAPD! Drop the guns!

31:12.087 --> 31:13.828
- Don't move!
- Drop the guns!

31:15.830 --> 31:17.876
Got the other oil guys.
Let's move, move, move, move.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.616
Go. Go, go.
Move in, move in.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.317
Lambert, stop this, man!

31:24.360 --> 31:25.796
Let Finley go.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.929
I know you got a bomb
planted somewhere,

31:27.973 --> 31:29.844
and I know about Noah.
Then you understand!

31:29.888 --> 31:31.933
Paxner's full
of money-hungry monsters,

31:31.977 --> 31:33.804
and Finley's the worst of all.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.894
He's gonna be here
when the derrick explodes.

31:35.937 --> 31:37.939
You better get out of here
or you will be, too.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.810
Deacon, you got eyes
on that device?

31:39.854 --> 31:41.247
Negative. I need time.

31:41.290 --> 31:42.901
I don't know
how much of that we got.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.212
It ain't got to go down
this way, Lambert. Let him go.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.822
If you lived near
one of his wells,

31:51.866 --> 31:53.259
he wouldn't think twice
about you.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.870
You could have asthma,
fertility issues, cancer.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.350
But we can't cut

31:57.393 --> 31:59.526
into the quarterly
profits, right, Finley?

31:59.569 --> 32:00.614
Please, please, come on.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.792
Hondo, is there a way
you can get him

32:04.835 --> 32:07.490
- to look at the bomb?
- It's an impressive cause, I'll give you that.

32:07.534 --> 32:09.971
But I wonder if Noah would
want you to die for it.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.016
How much time do we have left?

32:11.059 --> 32:12.191
Enough!

32:12.234 --> 32:14.236
But only if you leave right now.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.238
Otherwise you're gonna die
just like Finley here.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.720
Got it.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.896
Setting up now.
Another explosion

32:21.940 --> 32:24.072
ain't gonna help the people
you're trying to save.

32:24.116 --> 32:26.335
And it won't bring Noah back.

32:26.379 --> 32:29.034
Derricks break down, people
get sick, but nothing changes.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.297
So maybe if it's not
an accident, something will.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.994
You know what?
You're right.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.040
For years and years,
I've seen people in power fail

32:35.083 --> 32:36.563
to do the right things
over and over.

32:36.606 --> 32:38.217
It's always "too complicated"

32:38.260 --> 32:40.393
or "not the right time."

32:40.436 --> 32:41.872
Really, they just don't benefit.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.048
We got to force them to change.

32:45.137 --> 32:47.095
This isn't about revenge,

32:47.139 --> 32:50.403
it's for the future good. See?

32:50.446 --> 32:52.144
Initiating. On my count.

32:52.187 --> 32:54.363
Three, two, one.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.194
Go. Go.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.201
Device has been deactivated.

33:07.376 --> 33:09.030
It's over.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.946
Hey. Heard that woman
Powell rescued this morning

33:11.990 --> 33:13.992
made it out of surgery.
Is she okay?

33:14.035 --> 33:15.254
Hospital said it went well.

33:15.297 --> 33:16.951
It's gonna be a rough recovery,

33:16.995 --> 33:18.561
but if SWAT hadn't
gotten her out when we did,

33:18.605 --> 33:20.215
I don't think
she would've made it.

33:20.259 --> 33:23.175
You're headed over there,
aren't you, to check up on her?

33:23.218 --> 33:26.526
I know you, you'll never lose
that doctor-y instinct.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.745
Not a doctor, but yes.

33:28.789 --> 33:29.964
Want to come with?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.879
Yeah, let's do it.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.448
Credit card receipts
confirm that Scott

33:35.491 --> 33:37.058
really was out of town.
That leaves Cora.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.017
And we believe she
made the phone call

33:39.060 --> 33:40.366
that Ortiz overheard.

33:40.409 --> 33:41.584
When Maria tried
to play off the affair,

33:41.628 --> 33:42.977
Cora sought out and killed her.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.979
Cora wanted to know
what Annie's theory was,

33:45.023 --> 33:47.851
she even played into it a little
bit, but she slipped up.

33:47.895 --> 33:50.854
A jealous wife is a plausible
alternate suspect, but still...

33:50.898 --> 33:52.291
No, the woman knew something
only LAPD

33:52.334 --> 33:53.553
and her killer could know.

33:53.596 --> 33:56.469
The location of the body,
that's huge.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.079
Plus, we have evidence
of the affair.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.255
With a little work,
the details can be figured out.

34:00.299 --> 34:02.170
Can they? Because
I've been reexamining

34:02.214 --> 34:05.434
the work from back then, and
even if your theory is correct,

34:05.478 --> 34:07.567
there's really not much
tying Cora to Maria's death.

34:07.610 --> 34:10.787
All she would have to do is keep
quiet, and the investigation

34:10.831 --> 34:12.528
would go nowhere.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.096
Look, I'm sorry, but I told you
this would be a high bar,

34:15.140 --> 34:16.924
and this just isn't
there right now.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.629
Inventory in the armory.

34:26.673 --> 34:31.069
This brings back memories
of my SWAT rebel days,

34:31.112 --> 34:33.071
before I wised up.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.073
Not you, too.

34:35.116 --> 34:38.119
All right, hear me out.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.773
When I was a kid,

34:39.816 --> 34:42.167
my mom killed my dad
in front of me.

34:42.210 --> 34:46.127
She tried to con me
into lying about it.

34:46.171 --> 34:48.260
Really messed
with my sense of trust.

34:48.303 --> 34:52.960
So by the time I got here,
Hondo would say "jump,"

34:53.003 --> 34:55.528
and I'd think, "Why?" "For who?"

34:55.571 --> 34:57.443
And, "What's in it for him?"

34:59.401 --> 35:01.229
This is the weirdest
motivational speech

35:01.273 --> 35:02.448
I've ever gotten.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.928
Yeah.

35:04.972 --> 35:08.062
Yeah, none of them ever
really worked on me, either.

35:08.106 --> 35:12.762
So I, uh, I broke
every rule in the handbook.

35:12.806 --> 35:14.460
Got kicked out.

35:14.503 --> 35:17.289
Begged my way back.

35:17.332 --> 35:19.943
And then, one day,

35:19.987 --> 35:23.295
we were in the locker room
just arguing about

35:23.338 --> 35:27.168
seats in Black Betty
or whatever, and it clicked.

35:27.212 --> 35:31.216
My teammates were
never against me.

35:31.259 --> 35:32.913
They were never trying
to hold me back.

35:32.956 --> 35:36.177
All the lectures were
just 'cause they wanted

35:36.221 --> 35:38.527
to save lives with me.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.052
Is now when I'm supposed
to tell you

35:42.096 --> 35:44.490
how my family messed me up?

35:44.533 --> 35:46.274
Give you my sad story?

35:46.318 --> 35:47.623
Not if you aren't
ready to share.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.059
Look, I'm just here

35:49.103 --> 35:51.627
to do what my team did for me.

35:51.671 --> 35:54.761
Stick around long enough
for you to realize

35:54.804 --> 35:58.721
that SWAT is not a list
of tactics and regulations.

35:58.765 --> 36:02.160
It's a family.
And we make each other better.

36:03.987 --> 36:05.554
I got to get back to it.

36:05.598 --> 36:08.427
This inventory isn't
gonna take itself.

36:08.470 --> 36:10.342
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.693
Hey, Street?

36:13.736 --> 36:15.651
Yeah.

36:15.695 --> 36:17.392
I don't have a lot
of sniper experience.

36:17.436 --> 36:20.308
Rifle keeps jamming up
when I reload.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.615
Well, we can hit the range.
I might be able

36:22.658 --> 36:26.053
to bribe Chris to give us
both some pointers.

36:33.626 --> 36:36.019
I've been here six years now

36:36.063 --> 36:38.239
'cause I've got priors
and whatever,

36:38.283 --> 36:40.241
and you're telling me
the real killer was a housewife?

36:40.285 --> 36:42.243
I got to be
straight with you.

36:42.287 --> 36:45.115
Right now, the LAPD is not
interested in even entertaining

36:45.159 --> 36:47.683
the idea that Cora is
the actual murderer.

36:47.727 --> 36:50.947
Moving forward with getting you
released will be complicated.

36:52.035 --> 36:54.255
I understand.

36:54.299 --> 36:57.737
A few months ago,
no one believed me.

36:57.780 --> 36:58.999
You didn't believe me.

37:01.175 --> 37:02.263
And now you both are here.

37:02.307 --> 37:03.308
And you know
I'm telling the truth.

37:03.351 --> 37:05.353
We haven't given up.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.442
We're gonna keep digging,
try and find the proof we need

37:07.486 --> 37:09.488
to convince detectives
to reopen this.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.013
Others will be
convinced in time.

37:13.056 --> 37:16.146
God is good. Have faith.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.670
We do.

37:20.629 --> 37:24.111
Ah, I was just offering my
thanks to Commander Hicks.

37:24.154 --> 37:26.113
And I spoke to city council
about the safety updates

37:26.156 --> 37:27.723
for derricks.
Mm-hmm.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.639
It'll be an important topic
on the agenda this year.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.119
Well, I thought you were
hoping to leverage

37:32.162 --> 37:33.773
the messaging from today.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.427
The city council's
in the public sector,

37:35.470 --> 37:36.776
oil companies are private.

37:36.819 --> 37:38.647
These things are
gonna take time.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.997
Meaning you gave this
lip service,

37:41.041 --> 37:42.303
but now you're just gonna
let it fade out.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.000
I've done what I can.

37:44.044 --> 37:45.306
I looked you up.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.700
It turns out,
Grummings Petroleum

37:47.743 --> 37:50.920
built its West Coast
headquarters in your district.

37:50.964 --> 37:54.184
And guess who was in all
the ribbon cutting photos. You.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.230
Now, it's expensive

37:56.274 --> 37:58.493
to make safety updates,

37:58.537 --> 38:01.801
so you pushed LAPD around today
for political cover

38:01.844 --> 38:05.195
while oil drilling
clears the news cycle.

38:05.239 --> 38:07.981
You protected your company
bottom line, not your people.

38:08.024 --> 38:09.722
It's hardly
a conspiracy.

38:09.765 --> 38:12.812
Today, my constituents
cared about derrick safety.

38:12.855 --> 38:14.422
I honored that.

38:14.466 --> 38:17.469
But most days, people care
about their paychecks.

38:17.512 --> 38:20.602
Playing nice with Big Oil
means jobs for my district.

38:20.646 --> 38:24.563
The wells are polluting the air,
making folks sick.

38:24.606 --> 38:26.521
The derricks are dangerous.
They need to be updated.

38:26.565 --> 38:28.044
And they will be.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.264
One day, when it makes sense
for everyone.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.223
After how many more
in your district have to suffer?

38:33.267 --> 38:36.792
They may not know the source
of their trouble, but you do.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.446
Take action.

38:38.490 --> 38:39.926
You need to let me
do my job, Sergeant.

38:39.969 --> 38:41.623
We're on the same team.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.331
Wow, I can actually see
the wheels turning in there.

38:53.374 --> 38:56.812
I was just thinking about how to
get a motion filed for Eduardo.

38:56.856 --> 39:00.425
Even if it goes nowhere,
it's a start.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.818
You know, when you're
a big-time attorney one day,

39:02.862 --> 39:04.385
I hope your
future clients realize

39:04.429 --> 39:06.344
just how amazing you are.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.258
No, this should happen now,
not someday

39:08.302 --> 39:10.913
when I get time
to go back to law school.

39:10.957 --> 39:13.351
Okay, well, we'll talk to
somebody about filing a motion.

39:13.394 --> 39:15.353
But I think you should reach out
to your old professors

39:15.396 --> 39:18.704
and we can see about getting you
back to school next semester.

39:20.619 --> 39:23.535
The world needs people
like you fighting for it.

39:23.578 --> 39:25.363
I don't want to stand
in the way of that.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.235
You are never in the way.

39:38.201 --> 39:41.466
Don't you have a beautiful
woman waiting for you someplace?

39:43.468 --> 39:45.818
I just didn't want
to take this mood home.

39:47.297 --> 39:51.345
Figured I'd file some
paperwork until it went away.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.783
Well, that explains
why my inbox is full.

39:54.827 --> 39:57.307
But you're still here.

39:57.351 --> 39:58.787
Yeah.

40:03.009 --> 40:04.663
Commander.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.320
Councilwoman Gokey.

40:12.279 --> 40:13.846
She comes from a tough block.

40:14.890 --> 40:15.935
Like me.

40:17.893 --> 40:19.591
She pulled herself up.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.420
Like me.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.815
I wanted to believe
that we were the same.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.993
But we're not.

40:32.952 --> 40:34.519
Every time I feel like
I'm making

40:34.562 --> 40:36.738
a real impact in L.A., I...

40:38.697 --> 40:41.003
I get hit with how much left
there is to do

40:41.047 --> 40:43.092
and how few people seem to care.

40:43.136 --> 40:45.486
You know, sometimes I think
the best days on SWAT

40:45.530 --> 40:47.227
are the ones
where nothing happens.

40:48.489 --> 40:49.708
We don't get enough of those.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.144
No.

40:51.187 --> 40:52.711
No, we don't.

40:54.669 --> 40:57.280
It's because we take the weight
of the world on our shoulders.

40:59.108 --> 41:01.328
Just the way we're wired.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.373
But Hondo, it's okay to feel it.

41:03.417 --> 41:06.028
Or even put it down
from time to time.

41:07.987 --> 41:09.945
I know, sir.

41:09.989 --> 41:13.514
Eh, no, I'm not
sure you do.

41:14.602 --> 41:16.909
Go home, Sergeant.

41:16.952 --> 41:19.433
New day starts tomorrow.

41:26.658 --> 41:29.269
It always does.
