[shouts] Come on, Kimmy! We don't want
to be late for our high school reunion!

01:07.233 --> 01:08.526
This is killing me.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.653
As much as I love the dress I have on,

01:10.737 --> 01:14.699
my old prom dress keeps blinking,
"Wear me, wear me, wear me..."

01:17.994 --> 01:20.246
Or, "Burn me, burn me, burn me..."

01:21.956 --> 01:25.210
It's a high school reunion, Kimmy,
not a '90s theme party.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.629
Our entire lives are a '90s theme party.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.674
You know, it's such a shame
that Matt is still in India.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.468
I mean, he's missing all of this.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.638
But I texted him some photos.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.223
Did he like your new dress?

01:38.848 --> 01:40.308
Who said the dress was on?

01:42.894 --> 01:43.728
Was it?

01:43.812 --> 01:45.146
Yes!

01:46.147 --> 01:50.026
Oh, look! It's our high school yearbook.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.531
[sighs] I totally forgot I was voted
Most Likely To Succeed,

01:54.614 --> 01:57.575
Most Likely To Use "Gosh" in a Sentence

01:57.659 --> 02:00.161
and Most Likely To Marry Lance Bass.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.832
Gosh, they were wrong about that.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.252
All I got was Most Weirdest.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.548
All because one time
I ate a sandwich with my feet.

02:15.093 --> 02:15.927
[gasps]

02:16.010 --> 02:19.764
Aww, look at this picture
of me and Steve at Steve's prom.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.477
We had such big dreams.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.770
And big hair.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.358
Tonight's gonna be a great night.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.276
[cell phone beeps]

02:33.653 --> 02:34.529
For you.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.406
However, I will not be going.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.366
Woah, woah... What just happened?

02:39.242 --> 02:42.704
Kathy Santoni just posted this
on our reunion Facebook page.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.706
[DJ] "Garbage Bag Gibbler."

02:44.789 --> 02:46.916
Oh, that was senior ditch day.

02:47.333 --> 02:51.421
Yep, we were partying in the hot springs
and some joker stole my clothes.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.923
I spent the whole day wearing a trash bag.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.176
Nobody rocks a Hefty bag like you.

02:58.553 --> 03:02.432
Thanks, but you know darn well I was
the laughing stock of the whole school.

03:02.515 --> 03:07.228
Well, just for a couple of weeks,
'cause then Lisa Wolf farted in Glee Club.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.481
But who cares?

03:10.565 --> 03:13.276
I mean, you have blossomed
into a wonderful mother

03:13.359 --> 03:16.279
and a powerful, independent businesswoman.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.365
And let's not forget, my date
is the handsomest man in the world.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.702
[Spanish accent] Kimberlina, are you sure

03:22.785 --> 03:25.371
this is what men wear
to high school reunions in America?

03:26.372 --> 03:30.585
I wanna make sure everybody knows
you're a hot race car driver.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.297
Your job is to stand there all night
and be my man candy.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.175
I feel like a piece of beefcake.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.845
And I'm surprisingly fine with it.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.058
Oooh...

03:45.725 --> 03:47.727
Hit me baby one more time.

03:55.151 --> 03:59.239
First of all, put your hands together

-Nice!

Sometimes during tests, I close one eye
just to make it more challenging.

but she doesn't know who Jagger is.

the newspaper's Top 15 Dancers Under 15.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.163
Honey, that's incredible!

04:49.247 --> 04:52.875
Not only did you make the newspaper,
you also know what a newspaper is.

04:55.211 --> 05:00.174
And, last but not least, the newest member
of the Fuller Over Achiever's Club,

05:00.258 --> 05:01.634
Jackson Fuller.

Wow.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.360
That's unbelievable.

I... I mean, it's not unbelievable,

05:23.281 --> 05:25.616
it's just... really surprising.

05:25.700 --> 05:29.912
I mean, it's not surprising,
I mean... congratulations, honey.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.331
Thank you.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.669
Stephanie's first annual

-Hey, you guys.
-Hi, you guys look great!

05:52.852 --> 05:56.439
Deej, since you're going to
your class reunion at our old high school,

05:56.522 --> 05:58.983
would you return Lord of the Flies
to the library for me?

06:01.778 --> 06:02.987
It's a little overdue.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.157
Steve, this was due 22 years ago.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.161
Yeah, if you could just, like,
sneak it onto the shelf,

06:10.244 --> 06:12.413
you'd save me
about nine grand in late fees.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.125
Steve, you're a naughty boy.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.628
Maybe you should make me write,
"I'm a naughty boy"

06:18.711 --> 06:20.088
100 times on the blackboard.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.923
Maybe I will.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.554
Maybe you should take that outside.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.485
Kimmy, you can do this.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.904
You are a strong, black woman.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.991
No, you're not, but you get the idea.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.577
Look, there's Kathy Santoni.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.206
Are you sure that's her?

06:55.706 --> 06:57.458
Yes, look at those boobs!

Hi.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.800
Well, everybody's already organized.

Thank you for reminding me
of all the fun we had in high school.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.948
I can't wait until our 40th,

07:29.031 --> 07:31.951
so we can reminisce
about all the fun we had just now.

Correction: everybody cares.

Anyhoo, tonight we have
a celebrity in the house,

race car driver on the planet,

08:21.167 --> 08:24.795

and looks very debonair doing it.

Wait till you see this handsome face.

[shrieks] Oh, my God, you're a monster!

08:38.643 --> 08:40.269
I have a funny story.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.688
While I was waiting outside,

08:42.772 --> 08:45.816
I was viciously attacked
by a gang of bees.

08:47.401 --> 08:51.030
Perhaps I should not have passed the time
by tossing rocks at their hive.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.201
I haven't looked in the mirror,

08:55.284 --> 08:57.537
but I might be slightly allergic.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.291
I swear, he's gorgeous.
You should see him in his Speedo.

09:03.042 --> 09:07.463
It is true, I am normally
a magnificent sight to behold.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.717
Fernando, we have got to
get you to a hospital.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.678
No, it's your big night.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.514
I already called Lyft.
It is cheaper than Uber.

09:18.474 --> 09:19.308
Are you sure?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.103
Yes, I checked the prices.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.690
Kimberlina, goodbye, I love you.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.816
No, I'm DJ!

09:26.899 --> 09:30.736
Oh. I am sorry, my eyelids
are folding in on themselves.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.323
OK, um...

09:34.407 --> 09:35.449
Moving on,

09:35.533 --> 09:38.828
let's get this party started
with some '90s music.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.121
[all cheer]

09:41.497 --> 09:42.582
[cell phone beeps]

09:44.333 --> 09:47.461

09:47.545 --> 09:48.754
[all disappointed] Oh...

09:49.338 --> 09:53.134
Well, no worries, I'll just plug in
my phone with my '90s playlist.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.887
[man on phone] Kimberly,
this is Dr. Shapiro.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.141
You need to drink a lot of cranberry juice
to flush out your system

10:00.224 --> 10:01.601
and then, every two hours...

10:01.684 --> 10:04.395
[louder] ... you can just apply cream
directly to the affected area.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.189
With any luck, you'll be back in action
by New Year's Eve.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.483
[all laugh]

10:12.820 --> 10:16.741
Check it out, I finally made the fridge
with something other than a hand turkey.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.913
How did you get all A's anyway?

10:22.997 --> 10:24.915
I've never seen you study once.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.709
Ramona,

10:26.792 --> 10:29.337
in America, it's not about studying,

10:29.420 --> 10:30.630
it's about dreaming big.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.551
Again, how did you get all A's?

10:37.803 --> 10:40.765
I asked myself the same question.

10:42.558 --> 10:46.854
"Max, how does a C student
become and A student

10:46.937 --> 10:48.189
overnight?"

10:51.359 --> 10:57.490
And that's when I took a leisurely stroll
over to the printer-scanner-copier.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.119
Jackson,

11:02.203 --> 11:03.579
little tip.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.583
In the future,
if you wanna change your grades,

11:07.667 --> 11:14.632
always remove the original report card
from the printer-scanner-copier.

11:17.718 --> 11:18.928
J'accuse!

11:20.596 --> 11:22.139
What does "J'accuse" mean?

11:22.723 --> 11:25.017
It means I accuse you. In French.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.186
A language you claim to have an A in.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.899
Hey, hey, hey, hey... Whoa.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.067
Max.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.195
Are you saying Jackson
altered his report card?

11:36.278 --> 11:39.073
Because that does not sound
like the honest kid that I...

11:39.156 --> 11:40.658
Oh, yeah, he did it.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.285
So what if I changed my grades?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.079
Sorry I'm not good at test-taking.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.581
Or at using the printer-scanner-copier.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.875
Fine.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.337
Who cares about getting my stupid
report card on the stupid fridge,

11:53.421 --> 11:56.006
where we keep our stupid food
and our stupid drinks.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.675
I'm outta here.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.343
[sighs]

12:00.886 --> 12:02.763
Well, he definitely gets an A in Drama.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.853
DJ Tanner.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.604
The girl that got away.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.815
Oh, Nelson!

12:15.776 --> 12:18.654
You look almost the same.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.032
How are you?

12:22.116 --> 12:24.243
House in Stinson Beach and one in Maui

12:24.326 --> 12:26.954
and, of course,
there's the chalet in Aspen.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.748
I asked, "How are you?"

12:29.832 --> 12:33.461
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you asked me,
"How many homes do you have?"

12:36.338 --> 12:37.590
I see you're here solo.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.802
Good news, I'm flying solo myself.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.097
Oh, good for you.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.766
Gulfstream G6.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.228
I thought you asked how I was flying solo.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.816
Hey, Deej, is this poindexter
bothering you?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.528
-Viper?
-Hey.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.572
Gosh, what a surprise.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.867
Deej, you look even better
than you did in high school.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.119
And you looked good in high school.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.789
And you didn't even go to our high school.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.125
What are you doing here?

13:13.209 --> 13:14.752
Well, I came here to see you.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.795
You're the one that got away.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.255
Hey, I said that first.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.134
So anyway, I'm still playing in a band.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.428
And I got a day job at Foot Locker.

13:24.929 --> 13:28.516
My boss is a real tool,
he makes me buy him beer.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.268
I see you're still full
of wasted potential.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.186
Hey...

13:32.937 --> 13:34.313
How did you know I was wasted?

13:36.232 --> 13:39.151
And, now I remember
why I broke up with both of you.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.736
Excuse me, I'm gonna go mingle.

13:40.819 --> 13:43.614
-Great, I'll come with you.
-No, I'll come with you.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.574
Uh, no, you won't,
because she's with me.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.076
No, bro. She's with me.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.453
Actually, guys, she's with me.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.375
-Steve?
-Steve?

13:54.458 --> 13:55.543
Steve?

13:55.626 --> 13:57.878
Yep. My name's Steve.

13:59.129 --> 14:02.841
Now if you'll excuse me,
my girl and I would like some time alone.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.009
Thank you.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.598
Can you believe she picked that guy?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.184
Well, he was captain
of the wrestling team.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.647
And currently one of the Bay Area's
leading podiatrists.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.274
You can't compete with that.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.819
Steve, what are you doing here?

14:21.902 --> 14:24.697
Kimmy texted me, she said
you were in desperate need of an escort.

14:24.780 --> 14:25.698
Aww.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.867
You showed up to rescue me.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.702
Just like you did at my prom.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.413
Hey, Deej, you wanna see
if our names are still on the gym floor?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.164
Oh, there's no way.

14:36.750 --> 14:37.626
[gasps]

14:37.710 --> 14:38.586
Oh, Mylanta!

14:39.003 --> 14:41.672
You know, I carved that on our first date.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.090
I knew you were a keeper.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.092
I knew you were too.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.011
Why did we ever break up?

14:48.470 --> 14:50.723
Well, that was
my biggest regret in high school.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.684
And I wound up dating those two bozos.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.269
[strains, groans]

15:00.232 --> 15:03.527
I am so glad that you're here,
you just made my whole night.

15:03.611 --> 15:08.198
OK, everyone, in case you were concerned,
Fernando is breathing on his own.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.577
OK, let's party!

15:11.660 --> 15:12.870
[all cheer]

15:12.953 --> 15:15.080
["Can't Touch This" by MC Hammer playing]

15:36.685 --> 15:38.354
[music still playing]

15:42.608 --> 15:44.568
Somebody get this woman a garbage bag.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.861
[all laugh]

15:50.282 --> 15:51.283
[knocking]

15:53.577 --> 15:54.411
Hey.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.704
I'm very busy.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.333
Clearly.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.796
Do you mind if I take a moment
out of your busy schedule?

16:06.590 --> 16:08.092
Why did you change your grades?

16:08.175 --> 16:09.635
'Cause mine sucked.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.430
They didn't suck, they were just average.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.391
Well, except for the D.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.896
And I don't know why
they gave you a D in Wood Shop.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.482
Because that is a beautiful birdhouse.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.110
It's a spice rack.

16:31.281 --> 16:35.828
Well, in case you hadn't noticed,
everybody in this family is a superstar.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.372
Well, except me.

16:39.790 --> 16:40.874
I get it.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.626
You just wanna feel special.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.294
Everybody wants that.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.379
Well, great.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.048
Not even my feelings are special.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.510
You're being too hard on yourself.

16:51.593 --> 16:54.722
Really? Then name one thing I'm great at.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.516
You are a great friend to Cosmo.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.642
He adores you.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.943
OK, that was really bad timing.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.155
Let's just admit it.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.742
I'm not great at anything.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.577
And I never will be.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.289
[voice cracks]
'Cause nothing about me is special.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.751
Jackson, don't say that.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.961
Please, leave me alone.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.590
[sighs]

17:29.673 --> 17:30.591
OK.

17:39.808 --> 17:43.353
Excuse me, have you seen
a frazzled-looking woman wearing Spanx?

17:44.980 --> 17:45.939
[surprised] Woo!

17:47.649 --> 17:50.569
I am sorry everyone saw you in your Spanx.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.699
This reunion is a total disaster.

17:55.783 --> 17:59.453
My dress tore off,
my fiancé looks like the elephant man,

18:01.705 --> 18:04.583
and everybody knows
I have a urinary tract infection.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.919
[beeping]

18:07.002 --> 18:08.045
Smile.

18:10.255 --> 18:14.384
We can go home right now.
Whatever you wanna do, I'm here for you.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.679
Well, I can't leave, I still have to
pay the caterer and lock up.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.597
[beeping]

18:18.680 --> 18:19.515
She-wolf.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.849
[both howl]

18:23.227 --> 18:25.104
I hope you're having
a better night than I am.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.607
Well, I'm having
a pretty great time with Steve.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.692
I mean, a really great time.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.112
Maybe too great of a time.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.029
[beeping]

18:34.113 --> 18:34.988
Goofy face.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.409
It's so confusing.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.745
I don't know
if I'm having real feelings for Steve

18:41.829 --> 18:44.623
or I'm just getting caught up
in all the nostalgia.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.168
But maybe Steve's still in my life
for a reason.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.462
I think you should go and talk to him.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.632
And then let me know when everyone's gone.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.467
I'll be hiding behind the Dumpster.

18:56.009 --> 18:56.885
[beeping]

18:56.969 --> 18:58.345
BFFs

19:01.348 --> 19:03.517
[shouts] Jackson, we need you.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.726
[Jackson] No, you don't.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.395
[shouts] Lola's here.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.646
[Jackson] Coming.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.942
Hey, Lola. What are you doing here?

19:12.025 --> 19:14.987
Your family said you wouldn't
come downstairs unless I came over.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.530
OK, I'm going back upstairs.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.823
Na-ah, hold on.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.909
All right, we just wanna talk to you.
Please, have a seat.

19:21.910 --> 19:22.911
[sighs]

19:26.456 --> 19:28.167
[plays sour note]

19:31.044 --> 19:34.256
It's time for
the Jackson Fuller Award Show,

19:34.339 --> 19:37.926
we're we give awards to Jackson Fuller.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.183
[Ramona] I'll go first.

19:44.933 --> 19:48.395
Jackson, when I first moved in,
you were so sweet to me.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.564
You even gave me your bedroom.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.025
No, I didn't, my mom
took it away from me.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.487
And then I got so mad
that I ran away from home.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.158
But eventually you gave me your room.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.327
And that was very nice of you.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.204
So that's why this is for you.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.248
Best New Brother 2016.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.002
Is that a ballerina?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.089
It is.

20:16.798 --> 20:20.219
Because you are tutu sweet.

20:22.012 --> 20:22.846
Get it?

20:22.930 --> 20:25.182
Yeah, I get it. Can I go now, please?

20:26.850 --> 20:28.227
I have to tell you a story.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.314
A long, long time ago,

20:32.397 --> 20:34.191
I was seven.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.904
And there was a monster in my closet.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.740
Everyone told me I was nuts,

20:41.823 --> 20:42.824
except you.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.494
You believed me!

20:45.577 --> 20:48.372
And then you caught the monster
in a pillowcase

20:48.455 --> 20:49.998
and put him out with the trash.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.127
So?

20:55.295 --> 20:56.213
So...

20:56.713 --> 20:58.799
You saved my life.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.095
And opened up more closet space.

21:05.305 --> 21:08.308
And that's why I present you with this.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.062
This is Cosmo's certificate
from obedience school.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.150
And now it's yours.

21:20.570 --> 21:21.530
Thanks, I guess.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.323
Wait, hold on.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.160
This little guy told me
to tell you a secret.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.414
He said that you're the best brother ever.
But not to tell Max.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.168
He also said that you give
the best tickles in the world.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.254
So come on, give the kid a thrill.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.590
Come on, I woke him up for this.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.342
[sighs]

21:46.305 --> 21:47.931
The kid's an easy laugh.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.100
He thinks that light bulbs are hysterical.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.688
Um... I didn't really have
anything prepared,

21:55.355 --> 22:00.068
but you're my first boyfriend
and I am very picky.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.739
I think you're awesome
and you're a really good kisser.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.118
I am?

22:10.287 --> 22:12.331
Wow, I feel so much better!

22:14.833 --> 22:16.501
Why didn't we just start with Lola?

22:18.462 --> 22:19.421
You see?

22:19.755 --> 22:23.467
When it comes to being a great boyfriend,
a great brother and a great nephew,

22:23.550 --> 22:24.885
you get an A plus.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.764
The way you make people feel
is what makes you really special.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.015
Thanks.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.350
Really? I'm a good kisser?

22:36.313 --> 22:37.272
Ocupado.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.569
I'm not sure you remember me,
but we almost got married.

22:43.945 --> 22:44.905
Dwayne?

22:45.489 --> 22:46.656
The "Whatever" guy?

22:51.828 --> 22:55.373
Yeah, that's me, I didn't have
the most expansive vocabulary back then.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.711
It's so good to see you.
What have you been up to?

22:59.795 --> 23:03.298
Well, I went to Harvard
and then I became a motivational speaker.

23:03.381 --> 23:08.053
I took my lame catchphrase, "Whatever,"
and turned it into an entire worldview.

23:08.136 --> 23:11.598
It's all about saying "Whatever"
to any obstacle that life gives you.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.141
Kimmy Gibbler,

23:13.725 --> 23:15.977
your entire class is making fun of you?

23:16.061 --> 23:16.895
Whatever.

23:16.978 --> 23:19.856
Your fiancé got stung my bees
and looks grotesque?

23:19.940 --> 23:20.941
Whatever.

23:22.025 --> 23:24.277
Your Spanx are trending? Whatever!

23:26.863 --> 23:27.948
Thank you, Dwayne.

23:28.406 --> 23:30.158
I'm gonna go turn this night around.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.540
[suddenly nervous] Whatever.

23:44.631 --> 23:45.674
[music starts]

23:45.757 --> 23:47.509
That's our song, "Everything I Do."

23:47.592 --> 23:49.553
In parentheses, "I Do It For You."

23:50.220 --> 23:52.389
From our favorite movie, Robin Hood.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.141
Colon: Prince of Thieves.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.376
And old feelings too.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.588
Deej, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

25:07.547 --> 25:11.676
There's something I need to
talk to you about too. I'll go first.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.011
I'm gonna propose to CJ.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.973
Or you could go first.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.728
CJ has everything I'm looking for
in a partner.

25:21.811 --> 25:25.565
She's caring and funny and beautiful.

25:26.107 --> 25:29.194
All the things I treasured about you
when we were together.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.405
Thank you.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.534
Look... To be honest,

25:37.244 --> 25:40.038
I started dating CJ
because she reminded me of you.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.500
Now I love her for who she is.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.002
And if I learned anything
from our relationship,

25:46.670 --> 25:47.504
it's that...

25:48.880 --> 25:50.924
you can't let a good thing slip away.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.761
I've been thinking about that too.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.223
So, um...

26:00.475 --> 26:01.893
I guess I'm gonna propose.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.522
Unless you can think
of a reason why I shouldn't.

26:10.193 --> 26:11.528
I can't think of one.

26:14.823 --> 26:15.782
You OK?

26:17.492 --> 26:18.368
Yeah.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.203
[soft chuckle]

26:20.287 --> 26:22.580
I'm just, I'm so happy for you and CJ.

26:23.581 --> 26:25.125
I'm so happy for you and Matt.

26:28.211 --> 26:34.092
We just have to promise that no matter
what happens, we'll always stay friends.

26:35.719 --> 26:36.720
Because I love you.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.389
I love you too.

26:39.973 --> 26:42.225
[song ends]

26:50.317 --> 26:51.526
Deej, I'm back.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.445
Kimmy, what are you doing?

26:53.528 --> 26:55.405
Embracing my inner "Whatever".

26:57.282 --> 26:58.783
I'm using that correctly, aren't I?

26:58.867 --> 27:00.035
[nervous] Whatever.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.963
Kimberlina, it's me, Fernando.

27:14.883 --> 27:15.925
I had a feeling.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.761
What are you doing?

27:17.844 --> 27:21.723
I wanted to come back,
but I did not want to attract attention.

27:24.934 --> 27:28.355
-Take your bandages off.
-But what if you find me repugnant?

27:29.731 --> 27:32.442
I'm wearing a garbage bag,
we're way past repugnant.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.204
OK, everyone, gather around

27:44.287 --> 27:48.375
and get your pictures of Garbage Bag
Gibbler and Freak Show McBeeSting.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.961
Because I'm not here
to impress you people,

27:52.045 --> 27:56.383
I'm here to have a great night with
my best friend and my beautiful fiancé.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.009
So whatever.

27:59.803 --> 28:03.598
Even back in high school
you were never afraid to be weird.

28:03.681 --> 28:06.017
You're the bravest person I know.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.769
To Kimmy Gibbler.

28:11.773 --> 28:12.774
What are they doing?

28:14.025 --> 28:15.694
Oh, it's the slow clap.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.863
It means the nerdy outsider
is finally accepted by the cool kids

28:18.947 --> 28:20.407
and the movie's almost over.

28:21.991 --> 28:26.037
What a relief. In Argentina
it means you're about to be executed.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.872
[clapping gets faster]

28:29.958 --> 28:31.751
["Can't Touch This" by MC Hammer playing]

28:31.835 --> 28:36.297
Oh. I know we've heard this before,
but I only have two songs on my phone.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.799
[song continues]

28:51.229 --> 28:53.022
♪ One, two, three, four... ♪

28:53.106 --> 28:54.524
