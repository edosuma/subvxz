00:53.587 --> 00:55.454
It's like
taking sweets from a kid.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.423
Not bad, huh?

00:57.425 --> 00:58.007
Hmm?

00:58.008 --> 00:58.590
Thanks.

00:58.592 --> 00:59.975
Yeah.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.359
What do you reckon,
was that a good move?

01:01.362 --> 01:02.428
Was that a good move?

01:02.430 --> 01:03.430
Hey, no conferring.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.598
Thought she might
know a trick or two.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.701
Always distracted by
pussy, that's your problem.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.537
Yeah.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.540
Oh well.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.574
Nope, this is mine.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.543
Come on, not the last one again.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.748
Hmm?

01:22.750 --> 01:24.416
No, you know my
policy on herpes, mate.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.484
Keep it to yourself.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.155
It feels so surreal, man.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.692
One minute I'm in
Boston at a funeral,

01:35.162 --> 01:36.628
next I'm here.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.869
It's too bad about
your old man, mate.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.338
You know what, what better
way to forget about things

01:46.340 --> 01:49.108
and heal than this, huh?

01:49.110 --> 01:51.143
Your big brother's
old stomping ground,

01:51.145 --> 01:54.279
and getting your ass
handed to you at chess.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.283
What a good one, what do
you reckon, that good?

01:58.285 --> 02:00.652
Okay, that was good, but this

02:01.722 --> 02:02.722
is a checkmate.

02:03.791 --> 02:04.857
How the hell did that happen?

02:04.859 --> 02:06.425
Yeah, that happened.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.627
All right.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.329
All right, one more.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.664
And this time your derriere
will be well and truly kicked.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.399
Victory is mine, I can
smell it when it's ripe.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.467
That's your shorts.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.829
Well, it's better
than your breath.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.720
She's all right, she.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.823
Way out of your league.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.526
What?

02:40.528 --> 02:41.927
What, you don't
think I could do it?

02:41.929 --> 02:44.196
I know you can't,
I've seen your game.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.899
All right, you're on.

02:46.901 --> 02:47.733
I'm excited.

02:47.735 --> 02:48.667
You gonna do it here,

02:48.669 --> 02:49.601
or are you actually gonna go?

02:49.603 --> 02:50.769
There you go.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.739
Are you gonna wear that hat?

02:53.741 --> 02:55.174
It's a brave choice.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.885
Hello.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.687
Excuse me, where you from?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.622
Boston, America.

03:10.624 --> 03:15.494
Oh, USA, okay, go Redskin, go.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.031
You?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.498
Oh, sorry, I'm joke you.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.901
Okay, I'm take you around town.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.205
Plenty good store.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.373
Only 5,000 riel, okay?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.777
Is there anything like this?

03:31.779 --> 03:33.412
No no no.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.783
I'm sold you better.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.352
Not fake, good price.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.554
Okay, okay, go.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.989
My tuk tuk's over there.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.726
I wouldn't.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.494
What?

03:49.496 --> 03:50.496
How's it going?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.498
They'll take you to their
third cousin's shack,

03:53.500 --> 03:55.500
where you'll leave
either minus your kidneys

03:55.502 --> 03:57.002
or your Ben Franklins.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.737
I can handle this.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.940
I'm, uh, Ben.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.842
Fellow Red Sox fan.

04:03.844 --> 04:04.910
Just hanging out?

04:07.248 --> 04:09.281
Do you wanna join
us for a drink?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.816
I'm all right.

04:10.818 --> 04:11.650
Okay.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.319
Okay.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.987
Um, hey, you didn't
tell me your name.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.557
I know.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.891
Great, great.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.295
If I don't,

04:25.432 --> 04:27.699
okay, well, if you
change your mind,

04:27.701 --> 04:29.401
I'll be right here.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.809
Well, that went well.

04:49.757 --> 04:50.856
It's hard to take seriously

04:50.857 --> 04:52.257
when she doesn't
show up for a week.

04:54.028 --> 04:57.462
Hey Charlie, hey I like
what you done with the place.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.464
Yeah.

05:00.701 --> 05:01.667
Oh, oh.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.934
You go in shy, there you go.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.504
There it is, it's simple.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.705
So you got one more fill?

05:06.707 --> 05:07.706
- Absolutely.
- Yeah why not?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.007
Bei.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.509
Your Khmer is getting better.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.010
The only reason he
knows the word for three

05:12.012 --> 05:13.779
is he's hoping for
a threesome, huh?

05:13.781 --> 05:15.447
Oh.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.349
Hey Charlie, you let
me know where we can find

05:17.351 --> 05:19.685
those mysterious hidden temples.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.019
You know what I'm
talking 'bout, hmm?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.854
You know the ones
deep in the jungle.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.723
Oh yeah, I know what you mean.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.958
Hey wait, honey come over here.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.628
Now Charlie I think you
might have got it all wrong.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.696
They're not that deep.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.931
Turn around.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.435
Wow.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.736
She's been working out huh.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.271
You happy in Thailand?

05:39.272 --> 05:40.805
Very happy, I bet
she would rock my world.

05:40.808 --> 05:41.924
Yeah.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.041
Thanks but we're good Charlie.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.977
All right, three drinks
for my friend, huh?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.679
Thanks sweetheart.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.720
I swear to God, that guy
should have his own show.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.784
I'll be right back.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.486
All right man.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.987
Oh, incoming?

05:55.989 --> 05:57.622
Here we go again.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.858
It's just another
piece of ass dude.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.426
No I think you
might like this one.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.395
It's the one that
chewed you out earlier.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.029
What?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.597
Oh look, quirky move.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.467
Shit, is she coming this way?

06:08.469 --> 06:11.403
Yeah she's coming,
follow my lead all right.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.671
Dude she's not interested.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.906
Watch and learn young
miser, watch and learn.

06:15.909 --> 06:16.909
Hello you.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.814
Well you can stand then.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.950
I kind of owe you an apology.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.385
For not telling me your name

06:26.387 --> 06:27.552
or not leaving me your number.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.388
So is this real?

06:29.390 --> 06:32.924
Yeah, it was used
in human sacrifices.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.161
I guess one too many.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.131
I'm so sorry 'bout that.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.768
Can I buy you a drink?

06:42.770 --> 06:43.869
Yeah sure.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.980
This is where I
come all the time.

06:54.982 --> 06:58.850
I like to sit and people watch.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.621
Oh right here.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.626
This is nice.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.494
So what can this
piece of ass get you?

07:09.496 --> 07:11.897
Oh shit, you heard that?

07:13.100 --> 07:18.170
Okay my normal state is
geekdom, not sexist dorktham.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.839
A big geek, short
hair of the earth.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.774
Ah it's a common misconception,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.075
often perpetrated by geeks.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.045
Two wide please.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.883
It's a thing, the elk
call this a safe haven

07:31.885 --> 07:34.653
for the lone female backpacker.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.889
I spend my entire days
ducking sex tourists.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.460
I'm Ben, by the way.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.196
Wayward traveler heading north.

07:44.198 --> 07:48.066
Amber, heading anywhere
south of where I'm from.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.205
Thanks.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.207
Thank you.

07:55.075 --> 07:59.545
To boys who will be...
Degenerates.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.019
Well it's the last night
in town with my brother,

08:08.021 --> 08:10.222
we're off on a big
fishing trip tomorrow

08:10.224 --> 08:13.825
but I would rather stay
in town for the rave.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.530
Oh, you're here to full
moon, shroom, and get laid?

08:19.867 --> 08:21.166
So far so typical.

08:24.938 --> 08:28.507
Okay, what do you
say tomorrow night

08:29.877 --> 08:32.977
you can stay at the house
and listen to the jungle

08:32.980 --> 08:35.679
or you can travel
the jungle with me

08:36.950 --> 08:39.583
and listen to some House.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.822
No, well how 'bout
we start with dinner?

08:45.025 --> 08:48.059
Come on, come on, you're
my ticket out of here.

09:00.007 --> 09:04.609
Wow, okay.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.144
How do I approach this?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.679
This ones looking at me.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.714
And I'm pretty sure
he's still moving.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.184
Okay, so you start like this.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.125
And then you can go
for parts right here.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.099
It's a little spicy.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.837
Here, this will
take the edge off.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.682
I had fun tonight, thank you.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.816
Yeah, me too.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.034
Feel that?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.189
Tea?

10:24.992 --> 10:25.992
Uh-huh.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.896
Wow, this is nice.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.205
Please.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.144
He can keep you company.

10:47.381 --> 10:48.980
I won't be long.

11:24.751 --> 11:27.118
When does your
roommate get back?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.187
Trust me, she's not your type.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.692
Yeah, I don't know about that.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.041
They say once a guy
has seen a girl naked,

11:50.043 --> 11:54.746
her mystery fades,
hunter's instinct dampens,

11:54.748 --> 11:58.083
and all sexual desire
turns to fait accompli.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.821
Well speaking for
myself, interest is

12:04.057 --> 12:06.124
definitely on the
rise over here.

13:17.798 --> 13:22.267
Let's not rush
anything tonight, okay?

13:25.071 --> 13:27.572
I had an amazing time.

13:28.508 --> 13:29.508
It's just,

13:32.479 --> 13:35.346
can we save the vacation
fuck for another day?

13:36.349 --> 13:39.284
Yeah, yeah sure.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.261
Sorry, did I say or
do anything wrong?

13:57.270 --> 13:58.336
Goodnight.

14:11.585 --> 14:15.153
Okay boys, last
one back pays for lunch.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.255
No screw that, last
time I won I still had to pay.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.324
I don't remember
that happening, do you?

14:19.326 --> 14:20.525
No, I don't remember that.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.460
You prove it.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.394
Okay, double or nothing.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.363
All right.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.998
12 pack of Lao?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.132
I'm happy with it.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.367
All right fine.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.468
So I'm locked in.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.604
Three, one, two, three, go.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.506
Come on, come on Ben.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.641
Get off me man.

14:44.317 --> 14:47.452
Give you a headstart, go.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.287
Nice, nice.

14:49.289 --> 14:52.056
Get out of here asshole.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.193
Hey Ben, up the stream
without a paddle huh?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.494
Yeah I still got the beer.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.097
So.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.289
Sorry.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.691
Amber, there you are.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.360
Hey, been looking for you.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.595
Hey what happened last night,

15:30.597 --> 15:32.363
you started something
and then you pull away.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.065
What no?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.333
Come on back to the house.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.701
Come back, you can be
my little girl again.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.303
You like that, you like that?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.471
Hey, hey, hey!

15:40.473 --> 15:42.440
Get your hands off her.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.975
Who the fuck are you?

15:43.977 --> 15:44.609
A friend.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.443
Friend?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.711
Yeah.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.279
This one of your little
faggot friends here?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.548
Get the fuck out of my face.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.016
It's not gonna happen.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.453
She's mine all right?

15:55.455 --> 15:56.721
So you go find somebody else.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.323
I don't know him,
he's stalking me.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.458
What the fuck,
you're playing games?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.426
Don't play games with me.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.928
Come on, he's crazy, let's go.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.429
Come on, would
you back the fuck off.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.668
Now you come now.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.204
Come with me, come with me.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.442
No!

16:17.444 --> 16:19.077
Come on let's go.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.447

Run.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.484
Stop!

16:26.486 --> 16:27.318
Go, go.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.320
Fuck!

16:33.994 --> 16:35.226
No, no, you can't have it.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.228
Go, go.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.069
Go!

16:45.572 --> 16:48.006
Come on, come on, come on.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.475
This way.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.317
Come on.

17:05.592 --> 17:06.592
I think we lost him.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.666
Amber!

17:18.304 --> 17:19.404
What?

17:19.406 --> 17:20.538
I'll find you.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.205
What are you?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.243
Wait, wait, wait.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.246
Come on!

17:29.049 --> 17:30.648
We can work this out.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.085
I'm going to find you.

little run around?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.090
You have no idea.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.591
That A Boy.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.593
Listen, I don't think
you should be here alone.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.128
Just 'cause you got
laid doesn't mean

18:17.130 --> 18:18.796
you got a lay of
the land, you know?

18:19.766 --> 18:20.766
I'll be fine.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.535
Ben, this Isaac's big
trip, six months in planning

18:24.537 --> 18:27.672
and you're gonna throw it
away for some piece of ass?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.340
Look I'll join you guys later.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.643
Look believe me, after
today I can handle myself.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.112
Okay.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.680
I'll join you in a few days.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.750
Okay, hope she's worth it.

18:40.854 --> 18:41.854
She is.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.657
It's all good, it's all good.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.760
Time to figure out
my own shit right?

18:49.762 --> 18:50.762
Yeah.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.733
See you guys
in a couple of days.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.773
Hey Ben!

19:02.775 --> 19:04.142
Yeah?

19:04.144 --> 19:05.676
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.776
Want a drink?

20:11.778 --> 20:13.277
What is it?

20:13.279 --> 20:16.414
Whiskey and Red, a
local energy drink.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.682
Drink up.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.936
Come on.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.438
Come on, don't be shy now.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.241
All right your turn.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.778
Work it girl, work it.

21:10.937 --> 21:11.937
You okay?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.539
I got to find a bathroom.

21:15.541 --> 21:16.974
I think there's one up there.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.411
Do you want me to go with you?

21:20.413 --> 21:22.713
No, I'll be back.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.517
I'll be here.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.884
Amber!

23:09.822 --> 23:10.822
Amber.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.393
Amber!

23:20.032 --> 23:21.032
Oh, oh man.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.006
Hey.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.908
Well look who it is.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.646
I'm so happy to see you again.

24:31.471 --> 24:34.605
You'll make a very
pretty little boy.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.700
Friend, party finished, you go!

29:02.441 --> 29:03.441
Amber!

29:06.312 --> 29:07.312
Amber!

29:08.881 --> 29:10.047
Amber!

29:14.487 --> 29:15.919
What happened?

29:18.124 --> 29:19.890
Who did this to you?

29:19.892 --> 29:21.225
Those guys?

29:21.227 --> 29:22.227
I'm fine.

29:23.028 --> 29:24.161
What happened to you?

29:24.163 --> 29:25.395
That asshole, he came after me.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.297
And his fucking guys.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.465
I swear to God I
didn't do anything.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.000
Those guys beat
the shit out of me

29:30.002 --> 29:31.201
and now he's fucking dead.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.403
Oh fuck.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.272
He did this to you didn't he?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.306
We should go to the cops.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.308
No, no.

29:38.811 --> 29:42.212
They'll take one look at
you and say that you did it.

29:42.214 --> 29:45.182
He set you up, making
me as an accomplice.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.084
We just need to lay low.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.453
You can crash here
until it blows over.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.290
God, we need to get
you to a doctor.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.359
You're the one
who needs a doctor.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.394
Those guys, did they?

29:57.396 --> 29:59.263
No I told you, I'm fine.

29:59.265 --> 30:01.465
You don't look fine Amber.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.268
They got Western doctors here.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.270
Don't you see?

30:06.806 --> 30:08.272
No one did this to me,

30:09.208 --> 30:10.274
I have epilepsy.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.378
Epilepsy?

30:16.048 --> 30:17.514
I just want it to go away.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.452
I should have told you before.

30:25.357 --> 30:29.860
My family, are pressuring
me to have this

30:31.096 --> 30:35.098
neurosurgery in Boston.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.869
They don't speak Khmer too much.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.577
I think you should go.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.245
This is your ticket out.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.348
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.618
Stop trying to get rid of me.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.067
It's over.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.059
Amber,

31:37.096 --> 31:38.428
Amber!

31:38.430 --> 31:39.529
Come on.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.667
I like it when you
tell me what to do.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.140
Hey.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.309

31:58.417 --> 31:59.416
Hi.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.401
Yeah, hi.

32:00.402 --> 32:01.385
Do you speak English?

32:01.387 --> 32:03.370
Yes, a little bit.

32:03.371 --> 32:05.354
Great, do you have anything
for cuts and bruises,

32:05.357 --> 32:07.190
like some ointments?

32:09.361 --> 32:11.628
Excuse me sorry, we're
in a bit of a hurry.

32:11.630 --> 32:12.529
You'll see the doctor.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.064
Oh no I don't need a doctor,

32:14.066 --> 32:15.632
I just need some ointments.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.142
Thank you so much.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.545
I'm also gonna need
a couple of those.

33:36.715 --> 33:37.581
This one?

33:37.583 --> 33:39.249

33:41.754 --> 33:43.153

33:59.538 --> 34:01.271
Really?

34:01.273 --> 34:06.343
Okay, find another gullible
tourist okay.

34:14.485 --> 34:18.755
He say the dead man, his
spirit, he follows you.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.797
Sir, did you hear me?

34:32.638 --> 34:36.106
Put the powder in
her drink, please.

34:36.108 --> 34:37.940
Are you nuts?

34:37.942 --> 34:39.775
I'm not gonna do that okay.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.349
She must drink okay?

34:46.351 --> 34:49.553
Okay, all right, thank you.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.312
Come back to bed.

36:01.627 --> 36:06.663
You're hot, really fucking hot.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.834
Trying to take advantage?

36:10.836 --> 36:11.836
Maybe.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.341
You want some tea?

36:24.783 --> 36:26.917
Yeah, tea would be great.

36:52.678 --> 36:53.678
What?

36:58.784 --> 36:59.883
Amber?

37:51.303 --> 37:54.337
Oh, tea from tap water?

37:56.575 --> 37:58.341
Well if it doesn't
kill you right?

38:04.850 --> 38:06.716
You wanna go for a sunset walk?

38:07.819 --> 38:08.885
Sure.

38:13.625 --> 38:14.991
I feel a little...

38:18.897 --> 38:19.897
You want to lay down.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.934
Fuck, Amber, Amber.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.036
Look at me.

38:30.309 --> 38:34.878
Oh fuck, fuck, oh
please, oh shit.

38:36.315 --> 38:37.315
Amber!

38:39.484 --> 38:40.484
Oh shit.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.021
Hey open up please!

38:48.660 --> 38:49.726
Please open up!

38:49.728 --> 38:51.094
Who is it?

38:51.095 --> 38:52.461
The medicine you gave
me for my girlfriend,

38:52.464 --> 38:53.396
she's reacted badly.

38:53.398 --> 38:54.464
She's not waking up.

38:56.935 --> 39:02.005
Amber, Amber can you hear me?

39:06.978 --> 39:09.679
Amber, can you hear me?

39:24.463 --> 39:25.695
Evil spirit.

39:26.565 --> 39:27.997
Bullshit, she's reacted to

39:27.999 --> 39:29.666
whatever the fuck
you've given her.

39:29.668 --> 39:30.668
Now get her back.

39:42.114 --> 39:44.381
What she's saying?

39:44.383 --> 39:47.117
It's the language of the dead.

40:47.746 --> 40:50.213
She's saying, her name is Diona.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.897
She's got epilepsy, she
has to go to a hospital.

41:10.569 --> 41:11.668
Help me.

41:14.206 --> 41:15.206
No.

41:16.775 --> 41:17.775
No!

41:19.010 --> 41:20.210
Help, stop!

41:28.720 --> 41:30.186
No, not this way.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.160
Must give blood, your blood.

41:43.602 --> 41:44.634
Get the hell out!

41:46.571 --> 41:47.770
Now!

41:51.510 --> 41:52.510
The demon speak.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.780
Shut the fuck
up you fucking stoners!

41:57.782 --> 41:59.249
I'm trying to sleep!

42:01.553 --> 42:02.585
You goddamn idiot.

42:04.289 --> 42:05.955
Get out, get out!

42:08.827 --> 42:10.159
Get the fuck out!

42:10.161 --> 42:10.994
Okay.

42:10.996 --> 42:11.996
You too, go.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.297
Okay, we go.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.303
Get out.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.976
Hey, I'm so sorry.

42:26.978 --> 42:27.978
It's okay.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.048
It's okay.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.087
What is this?

42:38.089 --> 42:40.123
Get it away, get it away.

42:40.125 --> 42:40.957
Okay, okay.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.225
Okay, okay, okay.

42:45.597 --> 42:46.597
It's okay.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.098
It's okay.

43:04.149 --> 43:07.216
Do you remember what
happened back there?

43:07.218 --> 43:08.284
Not really.

43:10.255 --> 43:15.158
I just woke up to all this
weird shit all over me.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.062
So you don't
remember strangling me?

43:22.233 --> 43:24.033
I only remember your touch,

43:28.607 --> 43:29.607
your smell,

43:33.979 --> 43:34.979
your tenderness.

43:43.288 --> 43:44.988
What happened here?

43:47.292 --> 43:48.358
Operation.

43:50.161 --> 43:51.194
I was a conjoined twin.

43:53.632 --> 43:58.167
My sister, we were separated,
she didn't make it.

44:00.005 --> 44:03.806
Sorry, what was her
name, your sister?

44:06.745 --> 44:07.910
Diona, why?

46:28.853 --> 46:29.485
Join us Ben.

46:29.487 --> 46:30.920
Join us Ben.

46:54.412 --> 46:56.445
How long you been there?

46:57.482 --> 47:00.950
Just quietly watching you snore.

47:00.952 --> 47:02.919
Very attractive in a man.

47:03.822 --> 47:05.388
Ah, like the Chinese proverb.

47:06.891 --> 47:08.851
The one who snores the
loudest falls asleep first.

47:10.295 --> 47:14.363
Well if I had it my way, you
wouldn't be sleeping at all.

47:17.268 --> 47:19.035
Shine and rise.

47:55.373 --> 47:56.973
Where'd you get that?

47:58.076 --> 47:59.508
The concierge
were very obliging.

48:01.479 --> 48:03.446
It'll fry your brain.

48:04.382 --> 48:05.481
I wish.

48:35.480 --> 48:36.545
What?

48:39.517 --> 48:41.484
No, it's nothing.

48:41.486 --> 48:42.486
No come on.

48:49.027 --> 48:54.096
Your roommate, I mean
her clothes are just gone.

48:56.267 --> 49:01.337
Yeah, she must have picked
them up when we were sleeping.

49:03.574 --> 49:05.608
Can't say I'm gonna
miss the bitch.

49:11.282 --> 49:16.352
Sorry, sometimes I
just get confused okay.

49:17.722 --> 49:18.722
Okay.

49:21.492 --> 49:23.626
How long were you
two staying together?

49:25.363 --> 49:26.529
I got here a week ago.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.400
We had a falling
out, that's all.

49:33.104 --> 49:34.403
Oh.

49:34.405 --> 49:36.505
Aww, you bitch.

50:03.234 --> 50:07.103
We had a falling out that's all.

50:07.105 --> 50:08.270
I'm sorry, I thought you said

50:08.272 --> 50:09.832
you had only been
here a couple of days.

50:12.677 --> 50:14.377
It's Cambodian time.

50:16.647 --> 50:19.482
What, you don't believe me?

50:22.687 --> 50:24.653
It was way before
you and I hooked up.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.259
She's not even worth
the headspace okay.

50:51.315 --> 50:53.549
Hey, what are you doing?

50:58.289 --> 51:00.506
Stop it, hey!

51:00.507 --> 51:02.724
Hmm, I saw you throw away
her clothes this morning.

51:04.228 --> 51:08.297
Fuck me, if it
isn't Sigmund Freud.

51:08.299 --> 51:09.765
What can't you just
be straight with me?

51:09.767 --> 51:12.368
She was a friend
of the family okay?

51:12.370 --> 51:15.838
Things got weird when I found
out that she was into me.

51:17.108 --> 51:18.507
She flew home.

51:18.509 --> 51:19.575
Without her clothes?

51:19.577 --> 51:22.778
She traveled with
two other cases.

51:22.780 --> 51:25.614
It was just this crazy weird
situation, I wanted out.

51:25.616 --> 51:26.715
No more lies.

51:27.852 --> 51:29.218
You think 'cause you fucked me

51:29.220 --> 51:30.419
you've got a right to know

51:30.421 --> 51:31.587
everything that
goes on in my head?

51:31.589 --> 51:34.723
You know what?

51:34.725 --> 51:37.526
You should go home,
get your treatment,

51:37.528 --> 51:39.395
do what you got to do.

51:41.599 --> 51:43.432
And I'll join my
brothers at North.

51:47.705 --> 51:51.207
Okay Ben, I fucked her.

51:53.678 --> 51:55.211
Is that what you wanted to hear?

51:57.315 --> 52:00.182
I fist fucked her
all the way downtown

52:00.184 --> 52:02.618
and it was way hotter
than you and me.

52:04.722 --> 52:05.688
Happy?

52:05.690 --> 52:08.691
You know what, I'm outta here.

52:08.693 --> 52:09.693
Yeah you do that.

52:10.628 --> 52:12.728
I'll find me a real companion.

52:12.730 --> 52:15.164
One who's not such a limp cock!

52:19.737 --> 52:20.737
Fuck.

52:25.443 --> 52:26.675
Ben, Ben wait.

52:34.619 --> 52:36.152
Hello?

52:36.154 --> 52:36.685
Dan.

52:36.687 --> 52:37.553
Is this Ben?

52:37.555 --> 52:38.554
Hey man it's me.

52:38.556 --> 52:39.739
Ben?

52:39.740 --> 52:40.923
Yeah and I think the line's bad.

52:40.925 --> 52:42.642
Yeah.

52:42.643 --> 52:44.360
Hey, I'm coming to join you
guys first thing tomorrow.

52:44.362 --> 52:45.494
Uh-huh, tomorrow?

52:45.496 --> 52:47.329
Tomorrow, I'm coming
up, first thing.

52:47.331 --> 52:48.631
No dude, we're back.

52:48.633 --> 52:50.199
Yeah.

52:50.201 --> 52:53.269
Come to the Happy Kep
tonight, it's on bro.

53:01.345 --> 53:03.812
Hey play easy, you know
you're buying the drinks,

53:03.814 --> 53:05.548
she likes you, you
go to the hotel,

53:05.550 --> 53:06.682
and you negotiate then.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.784
I don't know man, it
feels kind of weird.

53:08.786 --> 53:11.820
Bro, you just got dumped
by a tourist, who cares.

53:11.822 --> 53:13.606
Easy.

53:13.607 --> 53:15.391
At least these ladies
here are gracious

53:15.393 --> 53:17.927
and obliging, you
know what I mean?

53:17.929 --> 53:19.895
Yeah, it's just the way
shit happens around here,

53:19.897 --> 53:21.363
you'll get used to it.

53:24.702 --> 53:27.303
Look, that guy back
there, that's Mr. Bong,

53:27.305 --> 53:28.571
he runs the show.

53:28.573 --> 53:30.406
He make sure they're
checked for disease,

53:30.408 --> 53:32.608
they're paid properly, so
they can feed their families.

53:32.610 --> 53:34.243
Hey look, the point
is, if you're rejected,

53:34.245 --> 53:36.579
it's kind of an insult, and
you don't want to do that.

53:36.581 --> 53:39.448
You know what I mean, be nice.

53:39.450 --> 53:41.483
You ladies okay with beer?

53:41.485 --> 53:45.221
Dan you know
how to treat a woman.

54:53.824 --> 54:55.691
Did you have fun?

54:57.528 --> 54:58.827
Hey Ben.

54:58.829 --> 55:00.329
Yeah?

55:00.331 --> 55:01.331
This is Lillie.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.867
Hi, you have a
very beautiful voice.

55:04.869 --> 55:08.604
Wait, dude have you
noticed every girl here?

55:08.606 --> 55:11.507
Hey Lillie, this is
my little brother Ben.

55:11.509 --> 55:13.475
Do me a favor, take really
good care of him okay?

55:13.477 --> 55:14.843
He's a little tense.

55:14.845 --> 55:15.944
Dan come on man.

55:15.946 --> 55:17.046
Hey, hey.

55:17.048 --> 55:20.849
Have fun Ben.

55:20.851 --> 55:23.485
You look a little tense.

55:23.487 --> 55:25.487
You like oil massage?

55:25.489 --> 55:27.690
Oh God, Dan!

55:27.692 --> 55:28.524
Have fun.

55:28.526 --> 55:29.591
Guys, come on.

55:29.593 --> 55:31.660
Just go with it,
just go with it.

55:32.063 --> 55:34.730
You might learn something.

55:34.732 --> 55:36.899
Is this your first time
with a Cambodian girl?

55:36.901 --> 55:40.069
Yeah, look Lillie, you look
very, very beautiful okay,

55:40.071 --> 55:41.503
but I'm not...

55:44.508 --> 55:48.577
Okay look, you should
take this, here.

55:50.981 --> 55:54.983
If I don't do massage,
my boss, he get very angry.

55:54.985 --> 55:55.985
He beat me up.

55:57.621 --> 55:59.655
Oh shit, fuck, really?

55:59.657 --> 56:03.359
No it's a joke, it's
fun you don't want to do it.

56:03.361 --> 56:05.094
There's plenty more customers.

56:05.096 --> 56:08.497
Okay, all right goodnight.

56:08.499 --> 56:09.832
Yes.

56:36.894 --> 56:38.694
I've got a time bomb in my head.

56:40.865 --> 56:43.432
And it fucks with me every day.

56:44.568 --> 56:47.503
There's no need to look,
'cause half of the time

56:47.505 --> 56:50.005
I'm not even the
person you want to see.

56:52.510 --> 56:54.476
I don't know who
the other person is.

56:57.681 --> 57:00.816
They make me do
things, hurt you.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.655
Maybe I got to go all out.

57:22.440 --> 57:23.440
Amber!

57:25.209 --> 57:26.209
Amber!

57:33.818 --> 57:36.051
Look at me, wake up.

57:37.955 --> 57:40.456
No, no, no, no.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.624
Come here, what
did you take baby?

57:42.626 --> 57:44.193
What did you take?

57:44.195 --> 57:45.195
Oh shit.

57:48.599 --> 57:51.166
Shit, you got to spit that up,

57:51.168 --> 57:53.101
you got to spit
that up, come on.

57:53.103 --> 57:54.803
Come on, come on.

57:55.706 --> 57:57.639
Come on, come on.

57:57.641 --> 57:58.641
Come on, come on.

58:00.077 --> 58:01.710
Spit it up baby.

58:01.712 --> 58:04.746
Oh shit, you've got to
get it out, there you go.

58:04.748 --> 58:06.982
There you go, come on.

58:06.984 --> 58:07.984
Please.

58:15.593 --> 58:16.692
Get it out baby.

58:19.597 --> 58:21.964
That's good, that's good.

58:21.966 --> 58:23.699
I came back for you.

58:33.244 --> 58:35.811
Why won't you let me try it?

58:36.947 --> 58:40.182
What's he gonna do,
blow incense over you?

58:41.252 --> 58:42.985
Cut you up like that
Chhor Eal freak?

58:44.088 --> 58:46.522
We need to get you
to a real hospital,

58:46.524 --> 58:48.123
not these crazy scammers.

58:48.125 --> 58:53.095
Look, De Rais has testimonials
from all over the world.

58:54.665 --> 58:58.000
This one's from Vancouver,
another one from Australia,

58:58.903 --> 58:59.903
dozens of them.

59:02.139 --> 59:04.039
He's helped people like me.

59:05.276 --> 59:07.009
What can he offer
you that the rest

59:07.011 --> 59:08.644
of the medical profession can't?

59:10.080 --> 59:11.080
Hope.

59:12.783 --> 59:16.618
I get that, but this
could be dangerous.

59:17.254 --> 59:18.820
Well I'm not afraid anymore.

59:20.791 --> 59:22.324
And I'm out of options.

59:31.602 --> 59:33.135
Thank you for saving my life.

59:36.840 --> 59:37.840
You shouldn't have.

59:42.179 --> 59:45.047
But now I want to get better.

59:47.318 --> 59:48.884
For you, for us.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:01.764
Okay.

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:19.181
He said to continue north.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.851
I haven't seen a road
sign in three hours.

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:27.623
It's got to be here, somewhere.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:30.692
Well whatever it is,

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:32.214
it's in the middle
of freaking nowhere.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:39.234
We're getting low on gas.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:43.905
It says it's close to
where the road ends, look.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:01.857
What are you doing?

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:03.158
Maybe someone will hear us.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:06.763
Okay.

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:10.198
Maybe he knows the way
to your witch doctor.

01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:20.042
You got a better idea?

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:26.114
Yeah actually,
hotel, langoustines

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:28.850
followed by food, steam bath,

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.952
and maybe a little toe sucking.

01:01:57.915 --> 01:02:01.016
Great, another dead end.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.959
De Rais?

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:12.995
De Rais.

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:18.500
You're just gonna
follow this guy?

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:20.202
Yeah, you coming?

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.339
Do I have a choice?

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:48.029
Mr. De Rais?

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:13.054
Please rest, you
must be thirsty.

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.934
They say you're a great healer.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:29.437
I see things, I
understand the nature

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:32.174
of what it is that is all.

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:33.441
You do your own healing.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:35.877
But you got my email?

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:39.047
Can you help?

01:04:01.939 --> 01:04:04.005
Weighs on your heart and mind.

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:13.615
It's very powerful.

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:36.204
As I explained to you,
will be necessary for...

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:44.045
Just so you know, I
think you're full of shit.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.383
Then why are you here?

01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:53.955
Because the last couple of days

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:55.957
I've seen some shit
that I can't explain.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.928
And I'm doing this for her.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:02.063
Ben, it's okay.

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:20.949
It is an entity, it
passed on in mortal form,

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:26.354
now lives inside.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:32.427
These lamps, killing fields,

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:36.131
this embodied
spirits all around.

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:39.668
I need a name, I need a name.

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:46.341
Her name is Diona, Diona.

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:01.189
Diona.

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:05.560
Sister spirit is most
powerful, was born with you.

01:06:06.363 --> 01:06:09.097
Each one carries the other.

01:06:10.968 --> 01:06:12.634
Amber come on, let's
get the fuck out of here.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:13.636
No.

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:17.138
Can you get rid of it?

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.240
I will try.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:24.012
Ask my spirit guides to assist
me in shifting it's presence.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:28.583
You need to be cleansed.

01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:30.685
Please do no be afraid.

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:33.488
My assistants know what to do.

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:36.725
I know you only
want to protect her.

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:41.196
I don't goddamn trust you.

01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:43.098
You saw for yourself.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:48.169
This entity, in many
ways it is part of her,

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:53.475
it feeds off of her.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:54.636
So what is your great plan?

01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:58.346
Oh the best way to
deal with such an entity,

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:01.216
disembowel it.

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:08.256
This way.

01:07:57.307 --> 01:07:58.373
Put this on.

01:08:01.178 --> 01:08:03.812
You will be the most important
part of the ceremony.

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:55.395
Baby if you want out you
tell me, I'll get you out okay?

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:02.504
Now you must give vigil
over her until daybreak.

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:05.540
So you can destroy the evil
entity when it appears.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:10.511
Whatever she says and
does, do not free her.

01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:13.814
It is the evil entity,
not her, understand?

01:09:25.929 --> 01:09:27.795
What is this?

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:30.265
They're asking her sister spirit

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:32.300
to step forward
during the ritual.

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:33.902
She may come in many forms.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.604
When the entity reveals
itself, cut here

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:40.408
to bleed it well.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:44.212
Evil entity will be
driven into the animal,

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:46.314
it will die with the animal.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.385
Be a man, make the cut.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.787
Only when the entity
reveals herself.

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:02.830
You must get her
to speak her name.

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:06.234
When she does, kill
the goat, understand?

01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:08.636
It's the only way.

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:13.608
Hey De Rais, De Rais!

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:18.546
De Rais!

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:28.357
Fuck.

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:40.903
Ben.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:45.306
Yeah, yeah I'm here.

01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:54.482
I made a mistake, let me go.

01:10:57.821 --> 01:11:00.388
It'll soon be over.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:04.626
No.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:09.765
What?

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:13.802
Why me?

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:16.272
No.

01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:22.677
Amber, amber.

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:25.747
Baby can you hear me?

01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:34.556
De Rais?

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:37.959
De Rais is that you?

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:57.779
Oh, oh, keep it together.

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:16.564
What do you want?

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:19.068
Hmm?

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:23.005
Help me,

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:27.443
release me.

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:32.747
Amber I swear there is some
weird shit going on in here.

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:33.848
Are you doing this?

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.353
What have you done?

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:41.756
What is this?

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:45.994
Hmm?

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:47.595
You have to
stay, until it's over.

01:12:48.098 --> 01:12:49.697
No, no please.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:56.838
If you love me, I need my meds.

01:12:59.642 --> 01:13:00.642
I don't have 'em.

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:05.380
I said get my meds!

01:13:09.519 --> 01:13:11.018
No, no, no, no!

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:16.524
Say your name!

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:17.992
My name is Amber!

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:23.798
Please Ben don't kill him.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.569
Amber, is that you?

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:30.906
It's me.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:34.842
I feel like myself I think.

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:39.580
I think it's over.

01:13:44.788 --> 01:13:46.721
Oh Ben, you know me.

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:55.530
Oh I'm the girl that wants
to get the fuck out of here

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:57.732
and dive into a nice
hot soak with you.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.768
Come on baby, please.

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:09.944
Oh my god I'm sorry.

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:12.780
I'm so sorry.

01:14:14.551 --> 01:14:15.616
Thank you.

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:21.756
What are you waiting for?

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:22.758
Untie me!

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:38.673
Is it just me, are
you horny as hell too?

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:49.984
When was the last time you
fucked a girl up the ass Ben?

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:56.858
Come on, they've got me all
tied up and ready for you,

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.192
those little bitches.

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:01.062
You stop this.

01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:03.564
Don't be a pussy, I know,

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:08.002
I know you want it.

01:15:09.739 --> 01:15:12.139
I know everything about you.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:16.210
I know exactly how you like it.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:05.927
Diona, fuck you.

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:14.702
No, no don't.

01:16:20.577 --> 01:16:22.843
Amber, Amber, Amber look at me.

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:24.845
Baby, oh no baby, baby.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.777
You risked everything for me.

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:04.652
You okay?

01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:07.254
Mm-hmm, it's over.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.109
Amber, Amber.

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:37.853
Amber.

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:44.892
Wait, who are you?

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:50.999
No, no.

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:55.370
No, no, no!

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:28.135
Listen I don't know
if this one's gonna work out.

01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:32.940
Look, I'm not gonna
do this anymore, okay?

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:47.989
Not this way.

01:18:52.829 --> 01:18:55.096
Thank you for saving my life.

01:18:58.334 --> 01:18:59.967
You shouldn't have.

01:19:11.013 --> 01:19:12.847
The best way to
deal with an entity

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:15.216
such as this, disembowel it.

01:19:44.147 --> 01:19:46.080
It was the only way.

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:49.049
She won't return?

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:51.452
Your sister's spirit now in him.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:53.854
She won't return.

01:19:53.856 --> 01:19:54.856
She's free.

01:19:55.892 --> 01:19:59.059
No one can ever know.

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:02.263
Thank you.
