WEBVTT

00:13.143 --> 00:14.797
What's-what's going on?

00:14.840 --> 00:16.320
You're very quiet.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.801
Yeah, it's, uh...

00:20.803 --> 00:22.370
It's been difficult lately.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.372
Why is that?

00:26.722 --> 00:29.768
Um, a woman I knew,
she was just...

00:30.726 --> 00:32.728
She was just murdered
by her husband.

00:32.771 --> 00:35.557
Oh, my gosh. Wha-What happened?

00:35.600 --> 00:37.863
She was pregnant and...

00:37.907 --> 00:40.344
he thought there was something
wrong with the fetus

00:40.388 --> 00:41.389
and, um...

00:42.390 --> 00:45.654
he tried to dig it out of her.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.090
Oh, my God.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.874
He thought it was an animal.

00:48.918 --> 00:52.704
He heard the fetus growling when
he listened to its heartbeat.

00:52.748 --> 00:56.230
And I thought it was just
paternal depression,

00:56.273 --> 00:59.059
so I said the things
that you're supposed to say,

00:59.102 --> 01:01.104
you know, "You're going through
changes, spousal anxiety,"

01:01.148 --> 01:03.193
et cetera, et cetera, and...

01:04.499 --> 01:06.283
I didn't warn her.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.068
I...

01:08.111 --> 01:10.113
- I didn't warn anyone.
- But there's no way

01:10.157 --> 01:11.810
you could know it was more.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.377
He-he sounds psychotic.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.596
And the warning signs
of psychosis...

01:14.639 --> 01:17.120
Yeah, but that's not it.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.209
Um...

01:19.253 --> 01:20.776
It was part of me.

01:24.693 --> 01:25.650
What do you mean?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.348
The fetus.

01:27.391 --> 01:31.003
Uh, I-I told you about
my egg missing, right?

01:31.047 --> 01:33.789
So that was my egg in her.

01:38.663 --> 01:42.363
- I don't know what to say.
- I was horrified.

01:42.406 --> 01:45.148
But part of me--
I have to admit--

01:45.192 --> 01:47.803
part of me was relieved.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.241
I-I didn't want
my genetic material out there.

01:51.285 --> 01:56.333
I didn't want another woman
to have... my child.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.945
And that's what horrifies me.

01:59.989 --> 02:04.124
The thought
of-of being relieved.

02:05.908 --> 02:08.954
- It was just a thought.
- But my thoughts

02:08.998 --> 02:10.478
are getting worse.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.915
I'm thinking...
I'm thinking darker things.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.918
I'm having trouble
communicating with Andy.

02:15.961 --> 02:18.050
- Why?
- The-the connection.

02:18.094 --> 02:20.792
You know,
technical difficulties.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.751
But sometimes

02:22.794 --> 02:27.625
something in me thinks
that he might never return.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.414
And in some way
that might be simpler.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.937
Again, Kristen,

02:34.980 --> 02:38.375
you know,
we all deal with dark thoughts.

02:38.419 --> 02:41.944
The boss we want to hit,
the neighbor we want to ki...

02:43.511 --> 02:45.295
Our subconscious runs wild.

02:45.339 --> 02:49.169
- But thoughts are not actions.
- Yeah.

02:49.212 --> 02:52.824
It's just that sometimes I think
I'm wishing for things.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.131
- And they're coming true.
- No.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.178
You're looking for ways
to blame yourself.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.181
The world works
with its own rules.

03:01.224 --> 03:05.185
It's-it's not dependent
on <i>your</i> thoughts and wishes.

03:06.403 --> 03:08.884
It's narcissism
to think differently.

03:11.408 --> 03:13.236
What happened to your hand?

03:13.280 --> 03:17.284
Oh. Uh, this? I... cut myself.

03:17.327 --> 03:18.981
Yeah. Shaving.

03:19.024 --> 03:22.071
You cut the back
of your hand shaving?

03:22.114 --> 03:25.292
I fell down.
I'm getting older.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.207
How's your back?

03:30.514 --> 03:32.342
It's good. You know, it's odd.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.257
I-I haven't thought
about it in a month.

03:34.301 --> 03:37.129
I-I guess I'm cured.

03:40.785 --> 03:43.266
- I-I've got to go.
- See you next week?

03:43.310 --> 03:44.746
Yeah, you know, let me...

03:44.789 --> 03:46.530
- let me see how I feel.
- I think we should

03:46.574 --> 03:49.925
go back to weekly therapy.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.102
Let me think about it.

03:53.145 --> 03:55.931

<i>Hey. You okay?</i>

03:55.974 --> 03:58.107
Yeah, uh, just, uh,
thrown a bit.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.022
But I want to work.
Where are you?

04:01.328 --> 04:04.069
East Cove Marina. Berth 22.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.897
<i>What, you bought a boat?</i>

04:07.377 --> 04:08.726
Something like that.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.947
- See you in an hour?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

04:11.990 --> 04:13.862
- I'll see you there.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.670
- Kurt?
- One second.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.285
Sorry.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.897
When I'm in a groove,
it's hard to stop.

04:48.940 --> 04:49.985
Kurt, are you all right?

04:50.028 --> 04:51.726
Oh, this?
This is, uh,

04:51.769 --> 04:53.162
this is just what I do
to write these days.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.730
It's-it's from Writing Twitter.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.340
- You sing?
- Yes.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.733
You should try it.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.648
Really, it gets you
in touch with your muse.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.867
Automatic writing. Like Yeats.

05:02.911 --> 05:03.955
Look.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.175
Halfway done.

05:07.219 --> 05:08.612
- Kurt...
- Do you want to read it?

05:08.656 --> 05:10.701
- Your book?
- Yes.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.095
Read it. I need to know
whether to keep going.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.663
And if you say
to-to-to give it up...

05:15.706 --> 05:17.621
I'll give it up.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.320
But I need someone
to read it first.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.892
So...

05:27.936 --> 05:29.372
what problem might
these people have?

05:29.416 --> 05:32.244
Hey, I heard about Valerie.

05:32.288 --> 05:33.333
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah,

05:33.376 --> 05:34.812
I didn't know her long, but...

05:34.856 --> 05:36.466
Again, you, you don't need
to do this.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.772
We've got it.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.078
- So, what is it?
- Monsignor just wants us

05:40.122 --> 05:42.690
to check in on a parishioner
who's missing mass.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.605
He'll fill us in on the rest.

05:45.910 --> 05:48.478
I guess I missed the part where
Jesus talks about the yachts.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.350
<i>Marina security.</i>

05:50.393 --> 05:53.309
David Acosta from St. Joseph's.
We were sent here by M...

05:57.835 --> 05:59.228
Wrist, please.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.143
You'll need these
to get on the yacht.

06:04.538 --> 06:07.018
- Hello?
- Mr. Trezza?

06:07.062 --> 06:08.846
Yes, yes, come inside, please.

06:08.890 --> 06:09.717
Hurry.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.242
Hurry, please. Hurry.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.768
Was there anything out there?
Did you see anything out there?

06:17.812 --> 06:19.466
A security guard.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.251
I can't go to mass anymore.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.776
I asked for
a eucharistic minister.

06:25.820 --> 06:28.039
What are you afraid
is out there?

06:29.345 --> 06:30.564
A demon.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.049
Do you want any of this?

06:38.093 --> 06:39.921
It's a Chateau L'Isle
Montrachet.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.531
It's $11,000 a bottle.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.141
I'm drinking it alone.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.534
- Do you want any?
- No, we're fine.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.362
Tell us about
this demon you saw.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.628
It's been following me
everywhere.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.414
Everywhere.

06:55.937 --> 06:58.592
I had to leave my penthouse
because it found me there.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.550
I flew to Europe,
it found me there.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.683
I never thought that my yacht
would be the last place

07:02.726 --> 07:04.946
I could turn to,
but here we are.

07:04.989 --> 07:09.429
Uh, let's get you
something else to drink, huh?

07:10.821 --> 07:12.606
I don't know why
I'm being punished.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.958
It's not like I'm a bad man.
I'm very devout.

07:17.959 --> 07:21.179
The minute I got this money,
I tithed a lot to the church.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.095
- Here.
- Thank you.

07:25.314 --> 07:26.620
I was a bank teller.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.492
I've worked low wage jobs
all my life.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.059
I was very good
about saving money,

07:31.102 --> 07:33.757
I made little investments
here and there,

07:33.801 --> 07:35.193
and then one day...

07:36.151 --> 07:37.457
...it all just hit.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.242
Big.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.985
That's when this thing
started following me.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.204
The demon?

07:49.599 --> 07:51.166
Do you want to see it?

07:51.209 --> 07:52.820
This is from last night.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.997
But it's been here before.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.090
I don't see anything.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.439
Watch.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.353
It looks like your demon
is a man trying to

08:48.397 --> 08:50.355
- break onto your boat.
- That's what I thought.

08:50.399 --> 08:53.054
But watch,
watch how it's moving.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.813
Do you see that?
It was doing that all night.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.118
I could hear it.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.685
It was trying to get
in my cabin

09:15.729 --> 09:17.078
and it was trying to kill me.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.559
And that's it.

09:19.602 --> 09:20.908
The cameras went out.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.910
Tech company said
it was a short on my end.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.476
Could it be someone
that wants to scare you?

09:24.520 --> 09:26.435
Exes or family members who want

09:26.478 --> 09:27.915
- to take your money?
- No, no one.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.612
Have you been visited
by the IRS?

09:29.656 --> 09:31.745
I mean, you did get
very rich very fast.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.921
- They initiated an audit.
- Oh, there you go.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.488
The IRS sends someone to visit
you to catch you off guard.

09:36.532 --> 09:37.533
An IRS audit

09:37.577 --> 09:39.491
can certainly be stressful.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.058
Have you heard
of achievemephobia?

09:41.102 --> 09:43.495
It's a psychological
condition that stems

09:43.539 --> 09:45.585
from guilt and the fear
of sudden prosperity.

09:45.628 --> 09:48.979
Listen, I am not stressed
because I have money.

09:49.023 --> 09:52.896
Okay, I'm stressed because
I am being stalked by a demon.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.421
What could make the lights
do that?

09:57.379 --> 09:59.511
Mr. Trezza, if you don't
mind, I'm gonna hook up

09:59.555 --> 10:01.513
my cell phone
to your security system.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.820
And then, when you get an alert,
I will, too, okay?

10:03.864 --> 10:05.866
- Sure.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.912
Hello?

10:08.956 --> 10:10.261

<i>Is est a Deo habetur.</i>

10:11.349 --> 10:12.394
You still need me?

10:12.437 --> 10:14.396
<i>No, Grace does.</i>

10:57.744 --> 11:00.050
These are all
the pages of the Poveglia Codex

11:00.094 --> 11:01.443
that are missing information.

11:01.486 --> 11:02.879
All of these are crucial

11:02.923 --> 11:06.143
to the future of the Church
and mankind.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.668
We cannot place this drawing
with the Poveglia Codex.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.539
Is this from another document?

11:10.582 --> 11:11.540
I don't know.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.498
But you drew this?

11:13.542 --> 11:15.892
Uh, would it help you
if you inflated this?

11:15.936 --> 11:18.852
We know inflating things
helps you talk to God.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.680
May I please take a break?

11:20.723 --> 11:23.334
You understand
how serious this is?

11:25.293 --> 11:27.077
David.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.605
How are you?

11:33.649 --> 11:35.042
I'm okay.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.698
- This is crazy.
- I know.

11:38.741 --> 11:42.136
I went from solitary confinement
in Xinjiang to this.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.704
Are you all right?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.531
I'm not used to it.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.620
Too many questions.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.492
You should tell them to lay off.

11:50.535 --> 11:53.234
I can't. They're holy men.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.150
Let me.

11:56.193 --> 11:58.021
One thing I've learned
about the Church,

11:58.065 --> 12:00.850
you have to set limits.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.591
Grace needs a break.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.993
All I could think about
were the kids.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.777
- At the day care?
- Yes.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.692
Have you been back?

12:16.736 --> 12:19.608
No. There hasn't been time.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.784
They're just anxious
to get answers.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.222
What is that?

12:26.354 --> 12:29.400
Oh, I needed it
to get through security.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.319
It's okay.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.197
There.

12:44.720 --> 12:45.721
What is that?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.679
The royal sigil.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.812
One of the most important.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.467
The band on your wrist
is connected to it.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.034
How do you know?

12:55.905 --> 12:57.820
Oh.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.083
It is time.

13:03.957 --> 13:07.221
Thank you, David, for coming.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.441
- I'll come back.
- If they let you.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.052
Grace.

13:13.531 --> 13:16.404
Ask what you need.
They'll get it.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.276
They need you
more than you need them.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.853
I don't understand.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.333
Wh-What does this have
to do with the demon?

13:32.376 --> 13:35.423
We think a lot.
Have you seen this symbol?

13:36.424 --> 13:38.469
- Yes.
- Where?

13:40.428 --> 13:41.472
One second.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.780
Wait, what is this about?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.914
Grace thinks that this is
connected to our case.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.872
How does she know?

13:53.441 --> 13:54.616
Here.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.359
I don't know
what difference this makes.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.143
Where is this from?

14:00.187 --> 14:02.842
A customer of mine
back when I was a bank teller.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.060
Tamara Hale.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.541
She was a, uh, a day trader.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.630
Made a fortune on a bubble
a few years ago.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.633
Do you have an address?

14:12.677 --> 14:15.898
Proudest day of my life
was when I bought this house.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.421
All cash.

14:19.075 --> 14:22.296
This was my house
three years ago.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.167
I'm sorry I don't have
more to offer you.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.169
I've recently had to downsize.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.737
Oh, that's okay, Tamara.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.870
We talked to Henry Trezza
about this pen.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.697
He said you gave it to him?

14:32.741 --> 14:34.351
Oh, yeah. It's my lucky pen.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.484
My uncle gave it to me
a while back. How is Henry?

14:36.527 --> 14:38.225
I always liked him at the bank.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.444
- He's struggling a bit.
- Really?

14:40.488 --> 14:42.403
I heard he was doing
really well.

14:42.446 --> 14:43.926
Financially, yes.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.015
Emotionally, not so much.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.582
Oh, yeah.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.150
I can relate.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.152
I used to think
money was everything.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.719
We didn't have
much of it growing up.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.678
My parents always argued
about it,

14:56.721 --> 14:59.420
and I vowed to make
so much one day

14:59.463 --> 15:01.248
that it would shut people up.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.729
So I made some money
on Wall Street

15:04.773 --> 15:08.124
and overnight,
suddenly, I was rich.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.910
And then the thing showed up.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.219
- The thing?
- That's what I began to call it.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.656
I started noticing
that I was being followed

15:18.700 --> 15:21.094
by this shadow
almost immediately

15:21.137 --> 15:23.270
as my stocks were doing better.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.967
At first, I thought it was a man

15:25.011 --> 15:28.014
dressed all in black,
but then I realized...

15:28.057 --> 15:30.016
it wasn't even human.

15:30.059 --> 15:32.932
- Are you being followed now?
- No, because I finally

15:32.975 --> 15:34.585
figured out what I had to do.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.152
What was it?

15:36.196 --> 15:37.980
Give away everything I bought.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.983
Every single thing.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.593
I mean, I started

15:42.637 --> 15:46.336
with just a car or two,
and then I gave away that house.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.208
And here I am.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.384
Home sweet home.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.561
- And you feel safe now?
- I do.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.650
The thing stalking me continued

15:55.693 --> 15:57.086
until I had given
everything away.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.697
It was like I took
my own vow of poverty.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.004
But I haven't felt

16:02.048 --> 16:05.399
or seen the thing since.

16:05.442 --> 16:08.532
And how did you know
it would work,

16:08.576 --> 16:09.969
giving everything away?

16:10.012 --> 16:11.579
Oh, my uncle told me.
He'll tell you.

16:11.622 --> 16:12.928
Ask him yourself.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.365
He was followed
by this thing too.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.237
And then, one night,
he says it got him.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.369
He fought it.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.632
And he realized the only way
he could escape from it

16:21.676 --> 16:25.854
was to get rid of everything.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.076
What is your uncle's name?

16:32.339 --> 16:34.428
You said my niece sent you?

16:34.471 --> 16:35.777
Yes, she said you were being

16:35.820 --> 16:38.606
followed by
the same thing as her?

16:38.649 --> 16:40.521
- A demon?
- Yes.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.045
Tamara said

16:43.089 --> 16:46.005
it caught up with you
and you fought it?

16:46.048 --> 16:47.615
Wrestled it, I guess.

16:47.658 --> 16:51.923
It hissed in my ear,
"Give it up."

16:52.881 --> 16:55.449
So I realized I had
to give up everything.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.190
- All your earthly goods?
- No.

16:57.233 --> 17:00.845
Just the things I bought
after I struck it big with DF.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.238
With...?

17:02.282 --> 17:04.849
DF. A stock on the rise.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.416
I got a tip

17:06.460 --> 17:08.244
from a guy in a bar.

17:08.288 --> 17:13.467
DF was this, this new stock that
was gonna go through the roof.

17:13.510 --> 17:16.905
I put a hundred dollars on it,
and, and it did.

17:16.948 --> 17:19.734
Shortly thereafter,

17:19.777 --> 17:22.432
the demon started following me.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.956
Then, when it told me
to give it up,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.047
I, uh, I started giving away
everything.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.483
Everything I bought.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.659
And the demon stopped
following you?

17:31.702 --> 17:32.877
No.

17:34.140 --> 17:37.926
That's when I realized
I used some of the money

17:37.969 --> 17:41.495
for Lasik surgery in this eye.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.802
And a nose job.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.414
And veneers.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.114
- You did this to yourself?
- I had to.

17:52.158 --> 17:55.248
It was the only way
to keep the demon away.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.337
I had to give it all back.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.558
The worst thing...

18:02.951 --> 18:04.431
...was my wife's
breast implants.

18:06.955 --> 18:10.001
Can I ask you, sir, uh...

18:10.045 --> 18:11.307
what does this mean to you?

18:12.395 --> 18:14.441
That's the logo for DF.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.770
I have to do what?

20:06.814 --> 20:08.468
Well, we're not
telling you what to do.

20:08.511 --> 20:11.471
We're just telling you
what Tamara and her uncle did.

20:11.514 --> 20:14.213
- They-they gave up everything?
- They gave up everything

20:14.256 --> 20:15.736
that was bought
with DF dividends.

20:15.779 --> 20:18.608
Uh, that's the stock tip
Tamara gave you, right?

20:18.652 --> 20:21.350
Yeah, okay, but that...
that's everything.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.483
Right, I mean, that-that-that's
this-this boat.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.746
- That's my clothes. My food.
- Henry.

20:25.789 --> 20:28.401
We think you need some help.

20:28.444 --> 20:29.924
Psychiatric help.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.491
I think there's some guilt
playing on you.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.492
Did they get help?

20:32.535 --> 20:34.233
Tamara and her uncle?

20:34.276 --> 20:35.277
No.

20:37.018 --> 20:39.368
You believe me, right?

20:40.326 --> 20:41.414
It's a demon.

20:41.457 --> 20:45.113
I think... I can't explain it.

20:45.156 --> 20:48.943
All I know is,
Tamara is happier now.

20:48.986 --> 20:52.555
She gave everything away
and she's not so anxious.

20:52.599 --> 20:53.643
What about her uncle?

20:55.297 --> 20:56.559
Well,

20:56.603 --> 20:59.606
he's had some
health difficulties.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.042
He had

21:01.085 --> 21:05.220
eye surgery and, um,
a nose job, and...

21:05.264 --> 21:07.222
he had to give those up.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.880
I'm sorry, what, give those up?

21:14.229 --> 21:16.231
Wh-What are you talking about?

21:18.059 --> 21:19.626
I-I have hair plugs.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.367
What-what do I do about that?

21:22.368 --> 21:24.283
I-I paid for my
mother's hip surgery.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.677
Wh-What am I supposed to do?
Rip that out? This is...

21:28.939 --> 21:30.506
This is insane.

21:30.550 --> 21:34.597
Look, I'm going to refer you
to a psychiatrist...

21:35.555 --> 21:40.386
Actually, I'm going to call you
with a good recommendation.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.605
Sorry, there has
to be another way.

21:47.218 --> 21:48.176
If you keep asking

21:48.219 --> 21:49.264
for help with your cases,

21:49.308 --> 21:50.570
I'm gonna start charging you.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.615
No, I don't really need help,

21:52.659 --> 21:55.314
I just want you to feel smart.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.532
Here, explain this.

21:59.230 --> 22:03.409
Looks like he short-circuited
the wires in one of the lights,

22:03.452 --> 22:06.586
and that caused the others
to go out, too.

22:06.629 --> 22:08.109
Mm-hmm. But how did he make

22:08.152 --> 22:10.067
the lights short out
at the precise moment

22:10.111 --> 22:12.069
that he walked under them?

22:12.113 --> 22:14.507
Smart Wi-Fi circuit breaker?

22:14.550 --> 22:16.422
They do exist.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.772
But it's a lot of trouble to go
through just to scare someone.

22:18.815 --> 22:22.906
Yeah. Well, I have seen people
do crazier things.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.734
What's this about, anyway?

22:24.778 --> 22:28.390
So, this guy got filthy rich
off of e-trading or some shit,

22:28.434 --> 22:30.827
and now he thinks
that a demon is stalking him.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.743
Hey, you do
some day trading, right?

22:33.787 --> 22:34.831
You ever heard of DF?

22:34.875 --> 22:36.529
No. Is that a stock?

22:36.572 --> 22:38.879
Yeah, all these three
invested in it

22:38.922 --> 22:40.402
and then they struck it
rich overnight.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.405
I don't day-trade,
but I do have a portfolio.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.276
Don't you?

22:45.320 --> 22:47.409
Oh, yeah. With all the money
that the Church is paying me,

22:47.453 --> 22:49.193
I have millions in investments.

22:49.237 --> 22:52.675
Okay, so you're saying that
this guy hooked up one light

22:52.719 --> 22:54.155
to the Wi-Fi circuit breaker,

22:54.198 --> 22:55.983
and that shorted out
the first light

22:56.026 --> 22:58.551
and then that shorted out
all the other lights?

22:58.594 --> 23:01.467
Yeah. And the rest is timing.

23:01.510 --> 23:02.903
Look at the pace he's going.

23:02.946 --> 23:05.906
He's trying to time
walking under the lights.

23:19.093 --> 23:20.486
David.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.099
David, can we speak?

23:25.142 --> 23:27.449
Grace has stopped talking.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.451
She stopped answering
your questions?

23:29.495 --> 23:31.801
She stopped saying anything.

23:31.845 --> 23:33.324
Contact her brother.

23:33.368 --> 23:36.937
We did. Her day care
no longer exists.

23:38.199 --> 23:41.028
You have to find a situation
with children.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.117
She loves children.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.252
Help us.

23:52.039 --> 23:54.084
<i>Back it up.</i>

23:54.128 --> 23:56.304
<i>Back that piece of shit</i>
<i>out of my space right now.</i>

23:57.871 --> 23:59.394
<i>I got here first.</i>

23:59.438 --> 24:01.744
<i>Put that camera down</i>
<i>and just talk. Get back!</i>

24:03.354 --> 24:04.443
<i>My space...</i>

24:04.486 --> 24:06.053
Mom, it's that supermarket guy.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.663
- What?
- That you punched.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.143
He's a jerk.
He's always harassing women.

24:09.186 --> 24:10.797
- All right, that's enough

24:10.840 --> 24:13.234
Tiki-Tik for today. Let's go.

24:13.277 --> 24:14.844
- Wait, hold up, hold up.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.498
<i>Hello?</i>

24:16.542 --> 24:18.369
<i>- Hey, Kristen.</i>
<i>- Hey, David, how you doing?</i>

24:18.413 --> 24:20.110
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!
- Hey, stop talking

24:20.154 --> 24:21.242
- for just one second.
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!

24:21.285 --> 24:22.243
We're not gonna go

24:22.286 --> 24:23.287
if you're not gonna stop.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.072
Just hold on one second.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.769
Yeah, what's up?

24:26.813 --> 24:28.597
I need some help with Grace.
What-what are you doing?

24:28.641 --> 24:31.252
Um, well, we kind of have
this tradition for my birthday.

24:31.295 --> 24:33.297
I-I can't really
back out right now.

24:33.341 --> 24:36.300
Oh, I'm sorry,
um, happy birthday.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.346
Thank you. What's up?
What do you need?

24:40.914 --> 24:43.569
Do you mind having a few guests?

24:46.267 --> 24:47.747
Are you sure this is okay?

24:47.790 --> 24:49.183
Ever since she was five,

24:49.226 --> 24:51.054
we've been coming here
for my birthday.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.708
So, are you a nun or something?

24:52.752 --> 24:56.451
No, no, uh, just someone
the Church wants around.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.888
Did you see those guys
over there?

24:58.932 --> 25:00.542
Yes. Just ignore them.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.544
They're trying to protect me.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.198
- From what?
- Hey, Lynn.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.547
Would you like some pizza?

25:05.591 --> 25:07.114
- Yes.
- When will my dad come home?

25:07.157 --> 25:08.550
Oh, Laura, no.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.291
But you said
she could tell the future.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.119
No, I said that
some people think

25:12.162 --> 25:13.468
that she can tell the future.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.991
Come on.
Let's go to the ball pit.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.993
Hold on, you haven't had
any pizza.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.299
I'll be right back.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.870
- Should we jump in?
- Yes.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.132
I'll go first.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.309
- Next Thursday.
- What?

25:28.352 --> 25:31.094
You asked me when
your dad's coming home.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.443
Next Thursday.

25:32.487 --> 25:35.272
- Really?
- Yes.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.144
Mom's worried.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.580
I know.

25:38.624 --> 25:41.757
But parents have to worry
so you don't.

25:41.801 --> 25:44.368
If we jump in,
will they jump in?

25:45.587 --> 25:47.981
- No.
- Here you go.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.302
Laura, give me one second.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.783
- What?
- I have to draw something.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.615
What are you drawing?

26:13.659 --> 26:15.661
I don't know, but sometimes
I just get the urge.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.025
What's this?

26:32.068 --> 26:33.722
Pizza sauce.

26:35.681 --> 26:36.725
<i>Padri?</i>

26:39.685 --> 26:43.340
This is a century of work
in one day.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.473
In less than one day.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.301
She's special.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.346
But you have to adapt
yourself to her.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.087
Not the other way around.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.393
What does that mean?

26:53.829 --> 26:55.701
Kristen's daughters
have fallen in love with her.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.008
They want to invite Grace
to a party tomorrow night.

27:02.142 --> 27:05.014
Do what you want,
but she's doing you a favor.

27:16.417 --> 27:17.940
All right.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.217
Oh, Kurt, come on.

28:16.259 --> 28:18.044
"There once was a lonely mother

28:18.087 --> 28:20.524
who lived in a mansion with her
four beautiful daughters."

28:30.360 --> 28:32.711
Come on, seriously?

28:43.025 --> 28:44.287
Oh...

28:45.419 --> 28:48.378
Oh, shit, shit,
shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Police activity. No admittance.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.516
I just need to see Henry Trezza.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.518
I'm just gonna take
one minute, okay?

28:57.561 --> 29:00.086
My guess is it'll be
less than that.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.395
Sir.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.974
- So, what are the police saying?
- Suicide.

29:19.018 --> 29:21.194
What about
the surveillance footage,

29:21.237 --> 29:22.412
I mean, of the attacker?

29:22.456 --> 29:24.066
No, they think it was rehearsed.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.851
So it wouldn't be deemed
a suicide

29:25.894 --> 29:28.244
and then Henry's family
could collect on the insurance.

29:28.288 --> 29:29.724
Seriously?

29:29.768 --> 29:31.465
Anything on that stock?

29:31.508 --> 29:33.597
- Oh, yeah.
- DF.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.819
DF. It is "a conglomerate

29:37.863 --> 29:39.647
"of disparate global businesses

29:39.690 --> 29:42.824
"that covers real estate,
social media,

29:42.868 --> 29:44.826
and crypto trading."

29:44.870 --> 29:47.916
- God, that could mean anything.
- Mm-hmm.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.613
Um, quick question.

29:49.657 --> 29:52.486
Are we still assessing someone
if they're deceased?

29:52.529 --> 29:54.967
Well, I'll talk
to the monsignor.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.056
Okey dokey.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.233
- Um...
- Yeah?

30:01.582 --> 30:03.410
Just so you know, uh,

30:03.453 --> 30:06.761
we agreed to this before
the events of the last few days.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.241
Agreed to what?

30:08.284 --> 30:10.896
When you go in there,
just act surprised.

30:13.463 --> 30:15.335
Oh, my God, it was
my birthday yesterday.

30:15.378 --> 30:17.250
They thought you were
doing that for them.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.078
They want to do this for you.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.602
Basically, what we're saying is,

30:21.645 --> 30:23.038
cheer the fuck up.

30:24.910 --> 30:28.130
Okay, cheering the fuck up.

30:29.305 --> 30:31.046
Surprise!

30:33.396 --> 30:37.792
Oh, my gosh, what a surprise.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.185
I thought we had
my party yesterday.

30:39.228 --> 30:40.969
Yeah, this is
the Double Bubble, Mom.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.318
What is a Double Bubble?

30:42.362 --> 30:44.016
It's the holiday
after the holiday.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.582
So you're not disappointed
when the holiday is over.

30:45.626 --> 30:47.976
Cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake, cake!

30:48.020 --> 30:49.412
Let's let Mom
say hello to everyone.

30:49.456 --> 30:50.674
Oh, this is my sister Karima.

30:50.718 --> 30:51.501
Guys, look, it's Grace.

30:51.545 --> 30:52.546
I invited Grace.

30:52.589 --> 30:53.982
It's Grace, it's Grace!

30:54.026 --> 30:56.115
Oh, hi, Grace.
Thank you for coming.

30:56.158 --> 30:57.507
Thank you for having me.

30:57.551 --> 31:00.162
I, uh, I had to bring
my entourage.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.601
Hi.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.613
Hi, we haven't met.
I'm Sheryl, Kristen's mom.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.920
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Grace.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.269
Are you from the Church?

31:20.313 --> 31:21.705
You have that, that energy.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.098
Do you work with Kristen?

31:23.142 --> 31:25.100
No, I'm not from the Church.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.842
But I sort of work with Kristen.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.801
So much happiness here.

31:30.845 --> 31:33.892
Oh, yeah, we're...
we're quite the family.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.770
Is something wrong?

31:45.164 --> 31:46.861
I'm not sure.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.305
I won't blame you.

31:57.393 --> 31:58.612
What?

32:00.570 --> 32:02.703
For tomorrow night.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.882
I'm sorry.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.232
Wh-What-what happens
tomorrow night?

32:25.769 --> 32:28.163
- Would you like some help?
- Oh, no.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.122
I'm getting
some forks and plates.

32:31.079 --> 32:34.343
- What's that?
- Oh, I-I'd stay away from that.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.563
- Um, it's candy salad.
- Oh.

32:36.606 --> 32:37.999
My girls make believe
it's healthy,

32:38.043 --> 32:39.827
and I make believe
I'm a good mother.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.135
You have very sweet children.

32:43.178 --> 32:44.963
- You think so?
- Yes.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.535
May I ask you something?

32:52.579 --> 32:53.710
Certainly.

32:57.323 --> 33:01.066
Last year I asked you
if Laura's heart would heal,

33:01.109 --> 33:02.589
and you said yes.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.026
Do you remember that?

33:05.070 --> 33:06.245
I do.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.464
Well, it did heal.

33:09.683 --> 33:10.989
I'm so happy.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.730
She's a ball of energy.

33:13.774 --> 33:15.776
Yeah, she really is.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.477
Can I ask you about Lexis?

33:23.175 --> 33:24.219
Yes.

33:27.092 --> 33:30.834
So, someone told me
that Lexis might have

33:30.878 --> 33:32.836
behavioral issues in the future.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.796
Now, I don't see it...

33:37.406 --> 33:40.757
What this person told you
is wrong.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.804
Lexis is a good girl,

33:43.847 --> 33:45.980
but she needs you
to protect her.

33:46.981 --> 33:48.026
I do.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.202
I think I do.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.640
Protect her from what?

33:55.207 --> 33:58.036
There are people wanting her
to do bad things.

33:58.079 --> 34:00.777
But if you help her,

34:00.821 --> 34:03.606
she will not. She's...

34:10.526 --> 34:12.267
May I use this?

34:12.311 --> 34:13.747
Yeah, of course.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.101
No.

34:26.499 --> 34:29.893
- Is this about Lexis?
- No.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.591
- Should I get David?
- No.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.078
What is it?

34:42.950 --> 34:44.517
Your husband.

34:46.867 --> 34:49.087
What does this have to do
with my husband?

34:56.181 --> 34:57.356
I don't know.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.272
But he needs your help.

35:03.144 --> 35:06.669
Having the best time,
I see, hmm?

35:06.713 --> 35:08.628
What is it,
all this priest action?

35:08.671 --> 35:10.064
No.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.197
Come on, I thought
you'd like these people.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.199
You've been acting
weird all night.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.462
I just don't really
know anyone here.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.333
Uh, Karima, I know you.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.161
That's not what's bothering you.
What's going on?

35:21.423 --> 35:22.859
I bought some stock.

35:27.821 --> 35:28.865
DF?

35:30.128 --> 35:32.739
Just a hundred shares,
couple of days ago.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.350
It went up.

35:35.394 --> 35:37.526
Made a thousand bucks.

35:39.702 --> 35:41.443
Good for you.
What's the problem?

35:43.793 --> 35:45.404
Last night when I was
walking home,

35:45.447 --> 35:47.014
someone was following me.

35:48.755 --> 35:52.541
I left Duane Reade and I saw
someone across the street.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.371
Every time I turned around
it was there,

35:56.415 --> 35:58.243
exactly the same distance away.

36:00.027 --> 36:01.071
Okay.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.205
I mean, come on,
you, you saw someone

36:04.249 --> 36:05.685
in the middle of New York City?

36:05.728 --> 36:08.078
It never seemed to have
any definition.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.863
It was just this figure.

36:09.906 --> 36:12.344
And when I left for work
this morning,

36:12.387 --> 36:13.997
there it was again.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.350
So, it was a man?

36:18.393 --> 36:22.702
It was tall, slim,
so, yeah, maybe.

36:22.745 --> 36:25.270
- I can't really say.
- Someone is screwing with us.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.619
Yeah, but why?

36:26.662 --> 36:28.098
You make any money on the stock?

36:28.142 --> 36:30.013
Not much. A thousand dollars.

36:30.057 --> 36:31.493
So it's not achievemephobia.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.016
Maybe we're thinking
about this all wrong.

36:33.060 --> 36:35.105
What do you mean?

36:35.149 --> 36:39.197
I've been checking the timeline
on this thing following.

36:40.850 --> 36:43.592
Even when Zach and Tamara
gave away their fortunes,

36:43.636 --> 36:44.985
they were still being followed.

36:45.942 --> 36:49.642
It was only when Zach gave
the stock tip to Tamara

36:49.685 --> 36:51.426
that he stopped being followed.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.602
And it was only when Tamara
gave the stock tip to Henry

36:53.646 --> 36:55.517
that she stopped being followed.

36:55.561 --> 36:59.173
Okay. So it's <i>The Ring.</i>

37:00.130 --> 37:01.523
Right?

37:01.567 --> 37:03.569
The supernatural world
is watching movies

37:03.612 --> 37:05.875
and they're basing
their rules on a B movie.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.181
Hello, that's not a B movie.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.182
I'm just saying that maybe

37:08.226 --> 37:09.792
it isn't about being rich.

37:09.836 --> 37:12.447
Maybe it's about
the stock itself.

37:12.491 --> 37:15.363
All right. You know, what?
Fine. Give me the stock tip.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.844
- What? No.
- This is stupid

37:17.887 --> 37:19.193
and you know it, okay?

37:19.237 --> 37:20.542
But if it'll make them
feel better,

37:20.586 --> 37:22.849
you text me the stock tip
and I will invest.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.242
Uh, I am not sure
about that, Ben.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.634
What?

37:25.678 --> 37:27.680
We don't believe
in any of this, right?

37:27.723 --> 37:29.334
So I'm betting

37:29.377 --> 37:31.901
that I invest
in the stock market and I lose.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.469
Because that is
what always happens for me.

37:34.513 --> 37:38.125
Okay, so pull out your phone
and officially text me

37:38.168 --> 37:40.606
the stock tip and we will show
the supernatural world

37:40.649 --> 37:42.085
that we mean business.

37:42.129 --> 37:43.391
- Great.

37:43.435 --> 37:47.874
Okay, DF, I'm officially
buying 100 shares.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.484
Done.

37:49.528 --> 37:52.748
All right, David, you can expect
my resignation tomorrow

37:52.792 --> 37:54.359
when I'm suddenly crazy rich.

37:54.402 --> 37:57.449
Now can we go have
some cake, hmm?

38:07.894 --> 38:09.417
- All right, already.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.027
Good grief.

38:14.901 --> 38:15.945
What's wrong?

38:22.517 --> 38:23.692
What is that?

38:23.736 --> 38:25.433
- A drawing.
- Of?

38:25.477 --> 38:27.217
You know what it's a drawing of.

38:30.612 --> 38:32.527
Who drew this?

38:32.571 --> 38:34.790
A woman named Grace.
Someone the Church has.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.966
Some prophetess.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.142
- Oh, yes. Grace Ling.
- You know her?

38:39.186 --> 38:41.754
I know of her.
We're a tight community.

38:42.711 --> 38:43.973
She's bad news.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.279
Yeah, I can see that.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.194
Who's she been showing this to?

38:48.891 --> 38:50.110
Kristen.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.461
What did Ms. Ling tell her?

38:53.505 --> 38:56.334
She said that Andy
needed Kristen's help.

38:58.858 --> 39:01.687
Okay, no need to panic.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.471
I'm not panicking.
You need to take care of this.

39:03.515 --> 39:04.472
Okay? Of him.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.169
- I agree.
- Okay.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.401
Hello?

40:44.311 --> 40:47.270
Okay. Come on, stupid.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.704
"Satan, force of power,

41:29.748 --> 41:31.793
force of enlightenment."

41:33.055 --> 41:35.449
Fuck you, Satan. I'm done.

41:57.906 --> 41:58.951
Bouchard residence.

41:58.994 --> 42:01.083
Oh, hi, uh, is your mom there?

42:01.127 --> 42:03.216
I'm not supposed to answer that.
Who are you?

42:03.259 --> 42:06.262
Well, I-I-I tried her cell
and she didn't answer.

42:06.306 --> 42:08.003
- Could you take a message?
<i>- Sure.</i>

42:08.047 --> 42:09.570
After you tell me who you are.

42:09.614 --> 42:13.182
Please tell her
that Dr. Kurt Boggs called.

42:13.226 --> 42:16.708
Dr. Kurt Boggs?
You wrote that scary story.

42:19.885 --> 42:21.277
I did.

42:21.321 --> 42:22.583
Uh, wh-who-who is this?

42:22.627 --> 42:24.193
<i>My sisters and I read it.</i>

42:24.237 --> 42:25.630
Lila found it in Mom's stuff.

42:25.673 --> 42:27.022
We need to know
how the story ends.

42:27.066 --> 42:28.067
When does
the next chapter come out?

42:29.938 --> 42:33.202
Soon, uh, I think, I hope.

42:33.246 --> 42:34.987
Writing takes time.

42:35.030 --> 42:36.554
You really liked it?

42:36.597 --> 42:38.947
Loved it. We were up all night.

42:38.991 --> 42:40.862
<i>The girl killing her mom.</i>

42:40.906 --> 42:43.256
<i>The ghost coming.</i>
<i>And all the body parts.</i>

42:43.299 --> 42:46.172
Yeah, yeah, yeah, those are
my favorite parts, too.

42:46.215 --> 42:47.521
It wasn't too bloody?

42:47.565 --> 42:49.001
No. But you can't just end it.

42:49.044 --> 42:50.524
What-what do you mean?

42:50.568 --> 42:51.830
<i>You need to tell us</i>
<i>what happens.</i>

42:51.873 --> 42:54.572
Oh, well, I'm going
for ambiguity.

42:54.615 --> 42:57.966
<i>No, it needs to end</i>
<i>and it needs to be clever.</i>

42:58.010 --> 43:00.882
Like, all the body parts come
together and go up the stairs.

43:00.926 --> 43:02.841
You know, like arms and legs.

43:02.884 --> 43:04.843
And then it pulls itself
up the stairs

43:04.886 --> 43:06.279
while saying something like,

43:06.322 --> 43:08.498
"Don't cry, kids,
I'm coming for you."

43:08.542 --> 43:09.804
Wow.

43:11.110 --> 43:13.068
Oh, my God. That's-that's good.

43:13.112 --> 43:15.375
We need another part
as soon as you can get it.

43:16.463 --> 43:19.422
Okay. Uh, and, uh,
tell your mother I called.

43:19.466 --> 43:21.686
And thank you.

43:21.729 --> 43:24.297
I will send you
the next chapter.

43:24.340 --> 43:26.299
Okay, I have to do
homework now. Bye.

43:26.342 --> 43:29.563
- I am good!

43:29.607 --> 43:32.131
I am good!

43:40.835 --> 43:43.664
Satan, force of power,

43:43.708 --> 43:44.883
force of enlightenment.

43:44.926 --> 43:46.188
I acknowledge

43:46.232 --> 43:47.668
that I am worthless
without you.

43:47.712 --> 43:49.931
I call on you to fill
my body, my soul,

43:49.975 --> 43:51.280
and my mind, Satan.

43:51.324 --> 43:53.021
Fill me.

43:53.065 --> 43:56.677
I realized how fucking
insanely stupid this is,

43:56.721 --> 43:57.809
so I went back out.

43:57.852 --> 43:58.897
And...?

44:00.115 --> 44:01.682
A couple blocks away,
he's there again.

44:01.726 --> 44:02.683
So, what did you do?

44:02.727 --> 44:04.511
I went after him.

44:04.554 --> 44:06.426
And?

44:06.469 --> 44:08.689
He turned a corner and was gone.

44:08.733 --> 44:12.780
I know there is
a logical explanation to this.

44:12.824 --> 44:16.349
Some kind of, I don't know,
Occupy Wall Street or whatever.

44:16.392 --> 44:17.742
- Power of suggestion.
- No.

44:17.785 --> 44:19.700
I am not suggestible.

44:19.744 --> 44:21.049
Not like this.

44:22.529 --> 44:24.966
I can stay here if you want.

44:25.010 --> 44:26.881
Bunk with you
next couple nights.

44:26.925 --> 44:28.709
Okay, now I really feel
like an asshole.

44:28.753 --> 44:30.450
All right.
Give me the stock tip.

44:31.451 --> 44:32.539
What?

44:32.582 --> 44:33.627
- Kristen.
- I'm serious.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.237
Pass along the stock tip to me

44:35.281 --> 44:36.586
and the dark figure
will leave you alone, right?

44:36.630 --> 44:37.892
And then what'll you do?

44:37.936 --> 44:39.459
I got an idea.
Just do it. Tell me.

44:39.502 --> 44:41.766
Tell you what?

44:41.809 --> 44:43.376
Tell me to buy stock in DF.

44:43.419 --> 44:44.594
Go on. Do it. Say it.

44:44.638 --> 44:46.335
Buy stock in DF.

44:46.379 --> 44:48.686
Thank you.
I think I will.

44:50.775 --> 44:52.428
So now what happens?

44:52.472 --> 44:54.039
Now I own 50 shares of DF.

44:54.082 --> 44:56.563
What happens when you start
to be followed by...

44:57.520 --> 45:00.654
A demon?
I think I can handle that.

45:17.366 --> 45:18.367
Hello?

45:24.199 --> 45:25.940
Oh, my God.

45:25.984 --> 45:28.682
This will stream live, bitch.
So if you came here to...

45:28.726 --> 45:30.336
I'm here to offer a truce.

45:31.337 --> 45:32.381
What?

45:33.905 --> 45:35.863
I've got a stock tip for you.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.203
Grace?

46:56.988 --> 46:59.207
Grace?

47:00.818 --> 47:03.864
You know what my favorite part
of hide-and-seek is?

47:05.257 --> 47:07.259
It's the counting.

47:08.521 --> 47:09.914
One.

47:11.393 --> 47:13.047
Two.

47:13.091 --> 47:14.919
Three.

47:16.529 --> 47:17.791
God...

47:17.835 --> 47:19.837
- Four.
- ...please forgive him.

47:21.229 --> 47:22.709
Five.

47:24.276 --> 47:26.626
Am I getting warmer?

47:28.367 --> 47:29.585
Six.

47:30.543 --> 47:33.024
Seven.

47:35.113 --> 47:36.462
Eight.

47:36.505 --> 47:38.420
Nine.

47:38.464 --> 47:41.293
Nine and a half.

47:41.336 --> 47:43.643
Nine and three-quarters.

47:44.731 --> 47:46.559
And...

47:47.560 --> 47:49.301
...ten.

47:49.344 --> 47:51.042
Ready or not...

47:52.043 --> 47:54.784
Ms. Ling, I have your dinner.

48:01.530 --> 48:06.622
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

48:08.407 --> 48:10.888
Do you prefer a breast
or a limb?

48:45.748 --> 48:47.837
Help!

48:50.144 --> 48:51.493
Help!

48:54.975 --> 48:58.761
My-my hand feels cold.

48:58.805 --> 49:00.415
Would you hold it, please?

49:06.291 --> 49:07.379
May the Lord,

49:07.422 --> 49:10.991
who frees you from sins,
save you

49:11.035 --> 49:13.646
and raise you up.

49:13.689 --> 49:14.647
I've...

49:17.911 --> 49:21.045
F-Father Ignatius.

49:23.177 --> 49:28.008
Tell him... I-I love...

49:37.148 --> 49:38.976
No.

49:40.064 --> 49:41.500
No.
