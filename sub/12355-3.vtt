00:07.301 --> 00:09.154
Previously on <i>House of Lies</i>...

00:09.179 --> 00:10.489
This was supposed to be
a game-changer for me,

00:10.491 --> 00:12.118
and he just does
whatever the fuck he wants.

00:12.119 --> 00:13.651
I know. Classic Marty, huh?

00:13.652 --> 00:15.318
What do you want, Marty?

00:15.319 --> 00:17.251
- We miss you at the new shop.
<i>- I really want to thank you,</i>

00:17.252 --> 00:20.651
Julianne... I am learning
a tremendous amount from you.

00:20.652 --> 00:22.451
- I enjoy mentoring.
<i>- It looks like</i>

00:22.452 --> 00:23.884
<i>Gil has been using</i>
<i>a statistical</i>

00:23.885 --> 00:26.251
methodology that's been
outmoded for years.

00:26.252 --> 00:28.851
Good luck with that DoD account.
It's in your hands now.

00:28.852 --> 00:32.252
Marty's ex-wife, she's 100%
shithouse-fucking-rat-crazy.

00:33.452 --> 00:35.651
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

00:35.652 --> 00:38.884
Just fucking fire me, please.
Just fucking get me out of here.

00:38.885 --> 00:42.284
I am gonna keep you here for the
rest of your mediocre career!

00:42.285 --> 00:44.884
Robert Tretorn, Free Range Foods.
<i>You are never</i>

00:44.885 --> 00:48.418
gonna find heirloom seaweed at
that white-trash Colossal Foods.

00:48.419 --> 00:50.484
How drunk are you?
You take Colossal Foods,

00:50.485 --> 00:51.418
I take Free Range.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.451
It'll keep them on the hook

00:53.452 --> 00:55.152
forever.

00:59.452 --> 01:01.651
<i>Oh, this is so good.</i>

01:01.652 --> 01:02.984
This is like a roller coaster,
you know?

01:02.985 --> 01:05.117
Like Full Throttle
at Magic Mountain or...

01:05.119 --> 01:07.151
Oh, SooperDooperLooper
at Hersheypark. Fuck.

01:07.152 --> 01:09.384
Oh, God, you're
so fucking stupid.

01:09.385 --> 01:11.618
Wait, why would you say that...
Oh, shu... Shh!

01:11.619 --> 01:13.685
Shh! Shh! Shh.
Oh. Oh.

01:37.219 --> 01:40.218
Big day, kitty cat.
Mmm.

01:40.219 --> 01:41.518
Do you want some coffee?

01:41.519 --> 01:43.484
I have a coffee maker.

01:43.485 --> 01:45.484
Somewhere.

01:45.485 --> 01:48.718
Didn't you move in, like,
seven months ago?

01:48.719 --> 01:52.218
Yes, well, I'm not
exactly Hattie Homemaker.

01:52.219 --> 01:54.718
So I guess no fresh baked
muffins either?

01:54.719 --> 01:56.018
No. Sorry.

01:56.019 --> 01:58.118
Hey, uh, what time is
your meeting at Colossal Foods?

01:58.119 --> 02:01.184
Uh, we land in
Phoenix at noon, so...

02:01.185 --> 02:02.818
by 1:00, Ted Lasky will think

02:02.819 --> 02:04.218
that converting a fleet
of stores

02:04.219 --> 02:05.751
into a healthy-
living brand

02:05.752 --> 02:07.651
was his idea.
Wow.

02:07.652 --> 02:08.984
You always been
this fucking cocky?

02:08.985 --> 02:11.218
I just hope you can pull it off
on your end.

02:11.219 --> 02:14.451
Because rumor on the street
is that you've lost a step.

02:14.452 --> 02:17.451
And I'm imagining this rumor
was started by...

02:17.452 --> 02:19.219
Somebody had to.

02:20.552 --> 02:22.484
Voila.

02:22.485 --> 02:23.951
Coffee maker.
Yeah.

02:23.952 --> 02:25.284
Do you have any coffee?

02:25.285 --> 02:27.118
No, I do not.
No, you do not.

02:27.119 --> 02:28.884
Doesn't matter. I'll pick
some up from Free Range.

02:28.885 --> 02:32.584
Robert Tretorn, on his latest
jaunt into the Amazonian

02:32.585 --> 02:35.118
rain forest, has discovered a
bean that will make you question

02:35.119 --> 02:38.318
everything you ever thought
about hot beverages.

02:38.319 --> 02:40.918
Why do I get the feeling you're
gonna love ruining Tretorn's day?

02:40.919 --> 02:42.551
'Cause I'm gonna love ruining

02:42.552 --> 02:43.618
Tretorn's day.

02:43.619 --> 02:45.084
Come on!

02:45.085 --> 02:47.318
An existential threat to his...

02:47.319 --> 02:48.851
pretentious baby?

02:48.852 --> 02:50.451
Oh, God.
Gonna be like...

02:50.452 --> 02:52.584
Christmas fucking morning.

02:52.585 --> 02:55.918
Yeah. And a, uh, full
frontal attack from Colossal,

02:55.919 --> 02:59.351
with a deep pocket like that,
is gonna send him scrambling.

02:59.352 --> 03:01.251
I know. It's gonna be a beautiful thing.
Mm-hmm.

03:01.252 --> 03:02.984
Cleanup on aisle five,

03:02.985 --> 03:04.718
six, seven.

03:04.719 --> 03:06.018
You gonna open the door or...?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.118
Yes, I'm gonna get the door.

03:07.119 --> 03:09.584
You can just...
help yourself

03:09.585 --> 03:10.918
to... anything.

03:10.919 --> 03:14.518
Hey. Sorry. I left my, uh...
Hi.

03:14.519 --> 03:16.084
Yep. Oh, there it is.

03:16.085 --> 03:19.084
What up? Hey, what's up, bro?
What's going down?

03:19.085 --> 03:21.551
How you doing, man?
He came straight from softball

03:21.552 --> 03:22.451
last night, so...

03:22.452 --> 03:23.251
I'm a catcher.

03:23.252 --> 03:24.851
You don't say.

03:24.852 --> 03:26.084
Yeah. All right,
you know what?

03:26.085 --> 03:28.951
I should get going.
Duty calls, so...

03:28.952 --> 03:30.351
All right.
Hey, stay awesome.

03:30.352 --> 03:31.285
Please?

03:32.585 --> 03:34.285
Don't leave him hanging.
Pound it out.

03:35.785 --> 03:38.119
Thank you.
All right.

03:39.585 --> 03:41.251
Bye. Okay.
Mm.

03:41.252 --> 03:43.384
Oh, I think
he might be the one,

03:43.385 --> 03:44.984
Jeannie.
Right, because every girl

03:44.985 --> 03:47.818
you've ever fucked is
a theoretical physicist.

03:47.819 --> 03:49.484
So, he's a catcher.

03:49.485 --> 03:52.718
Now, what position does he play
on the softball team? Oh, no.

03:52.719 --> 03:54.884
You do not get to have the
Jeannie-with-a-strap-on fantasy.

03:54.885 --> 03:56.919
Sorry, Marty, you had
your chance... you blew it.

04:00.219 --> 04:03.084
Yeah, uh, look,

04:03.085 --> 04:04.918
I know we never had
a real conversation

04:04.919 --> 04:06.218
about anything that...
You know what? I have so much to do

04:06.219 --> 04:07.651
before I get on this flight.

04:07.652 --> 04:09.884
Yep. I got to get Roscoe
to school.

04:09.885 --> 04:11.686
Tell me you're not gonna
fuck me over on this.

04:13.719 --> 04:15.418
Are you kidding me?

04:15.419 --> 04:17.250
Jeannie, come on. What...

04:17.252 --> 04:19.517
Whatever you think about me,
why would I do that?

04:19.519 --> 04:23.451
From a purely
financial standpoint.

04:23.452 --> 04:26.118
Jeannie, this is gonna be huge
for both of us, okay?

04:26.119 --> 04:29.584
My brand-new company gets
a steady cash infusion,

04:29.585 --> 04:31.384
and you get to waltz
right back into Galweather

04:31.385 --> 04:33.384
as a conquering hero.

04:33.385 --> 04:36.118
I already have Julianne
pirouetting

04:36.119 --> 04:37.951
like a ballerina in a music box.

04:37.952 --> 04:40.818
This is a win, Marty,
but I certainly don't need it.

04:40.819 --> 04:41.952
So why are you doing it?

04:44.085 --> 04:46.085
Maybe I'm gonna fuck you over.

04:48.752 --> 04:49.819
Yeah. Maybe.

04:56.985 --> 04:58.951
My office.
Oh, Jeannie.

04:58.952 --> 05:00.484
I couldn't sleep last night.

05:00.485 --> 05:02.018
And normally
I'm an amazing sleeper,

05:02.019 --> 05:03.951
but last night, I was,
like, mwah, you know?

05:03.952 --> 05:05.751
I mean, I was just raised
with certain values.

05:05.752 --> 05:07.118
You get what I'm saying.
I mean, I think

05:07.119 --> 05:09.051
our childhoods are
pretty similar, actually.

05:09.052 --> 05:11.118
Our families lived
paycheck to paycheck.

05:11.119 --> 05:13.984
Christmas was a homemade scarf
and an extra slice of ham.

05:13.985 --> 05:16.984
And while the rich kids were off
skiing and horseback riding,

05:16.985 --> 05:19.184
we were developing
strong moral character.

05:19.185 --> 05:20.484
I mean, we're not saints,
Jeannie,

05:20.485 --> 05:22.251
but we're what my Aunt Helen
would call good people.

05:22.252 --> 05:24.918
Benita, I have absolutely no
idea what you're talking about.

05:24.919 --> 05:26.118
The work we're doing.

05:26.119 --> 05:27.351
For the Defense Department.

05:27.352 --> 05:29.218
Why are you whispering?
Because I think

05:29.219 --> 05:31.718
we've crossed some legal
and ethical boundaries.

05:31.719 --> 05:32.984
When we first started,

05:32.985 --> 05:35.018
I was focused
on the statistical models.

05:35.019 --> 05:37.084
But now, seeing the breadth
of the data mining,

05:37.085 --> 05:38.718
it goes well beyond
what the FISA court

05:38.719 --> 05:40.651
deemed Constitutional.
Okay, I'm getting every other word,

05:40.652 --> 05:43.151
so if you could just condense what you...
I'm sorry. You have justeen

05:43.152 --> 05:45.951
such an amazing mentor.
What? She's not your mentor.

05:45.952 --> 05:48.384
And I am on the horns
of a real dilemma.

05:48.385 --> 05:50.418
I mean, I consider
myself a patriot.

05:50.419 --> 05:52.318
I love my country.
I love my <i> country.</i>

05:52.319 --> 05:54.218
And, I mean, I definitely
wouldn't want for there

05:54.219 --> 05:55.384
to be another 911.

05:55.385 --> 05:57.118
What? Who calls it 911?

05:57.119 --> 05:59.718
It's 9/11.
A lot of people died that day, Doug.

05:59.719 --> 06:01.751
Does it really
matter what we call it?

06:01.752 --> 06:04.351
Hey. A guy who once dated
my aunt

06:04.352 --> 06:06.784
worked at Cantor Fitzgerald,
so don't you... No. Okay. All right.

06:06.785 --> 06:08.451
Don't you dare give me the high hat.
It's okay. No...

06:08.452 --> 06:10.518
Well, now you said
"give me the high hat."

06:10.519 --> 06:12.151
He brings it out in me.
I don't mean to.

06:12.152 --> 06:14.418
Oh, yeah.
Doug, I wish so much for us to be friends.

06:14.419 --> 06:17.118
That's the bird. He just
flipped me the bird, Jeannie.

06:17.119 --> 06:18.551
Really, Doug? Really?
Yeah.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.351
Telling stories.
Jeannie... Excuse me.

06:20.352 --> 06:21.551
Can I help you with something?

06:21.552 --> 06:23.584
No.

06:23.585 --> 06:26.618
I'm good.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.418
Hmm.

06:29.419 --> 06:31.218
Hi.

06:31.219 --> 06:33.318
Okay. Yeah.

06:33.319 --> 06:35.318
It's privacy violations
up the wazoo.

06:35.319 --> 06:38.018
Come on.
And it's not just illegal, it's wrong.

06:38.019 --> 06:40.418
And I'm not just saying this.
I mean, even us good girls

06:40.419 --> 06:42.751
have our moments, too... look,
I'm-I'm not ashamed to admit

06:42.752 --> 06:45.318
I may have sent a topless selfie
or two in my day.

06:45.319 --> 06:46.751
Ugh.

06:46.752 --> 06:48.318
And I wouldn't be opposed
to letting the government

06:48.319 --> 06:50.351
have a peek if I thought
it would aid national security.

06:50.352 --> 06:51.684
If these
silver dollars could thwart

06:51.685 --> 06:52.984
the international
terrorist effort,

06:52.985 --> 06:54.451
God bless you.
Otherwise, I say,

06:54.452 --> 06:56.118
"Eyes to yourself,
federal agents.

06:56.119 --> 06:58.618
Unless you're cute and drive
a nice car.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.451
Jeannie, they need you

07:00.452 --> 07:01.684
in the conference room.

07:01.685 --> 07:03.584
Um...

07:03.585 --> 07:05.119
did they say why?

Beautiful day, isn't it,
darlin'?

07:21.519 --> 07:24.119
It's okay.

07:25.852 --> 07:27.884
Sir...

07:27.885 --> 07:31.284
Gil, my man.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.251
- Good to see you again.
- You, too, you big bear.

07:34.252 --> 07:36.251
It is good to be here.

07:36.252 --> 07:39.784
Hey, Jeannie.

07:39.785 --> 07:41.318
Why don't you...

07:41.319 --> 07:43.052
find a seat.

07:51.085 --> 07:52.885
I'm back!

08:02.585 --> 08:05.151
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>we're at fucking</i>

08:05.152 --> 08:06.784
Monica's house.
Feel like we're errand boys

08:06.785 --> 08:08.618
while she's off doing
her morning ablutions, man.

08:08.619 --> 08:09.784
This is a fucking shit show.

08:09.785 --> 08:11.918
Life's a fucking shit show.

08:11.919 --> 08:13.484
Aw, thank you so much,
R-rated Charlie Brown.

08:13.485 --> 08:14.651
I'm happy you're here.

08:14.652 --> 08:16.084
I'm not Charlie Brown.
You're exactly

08:16.085 --> 08:19.184
Charlie Brown, except for
that cute little red-haired girl

08:19.185 --> 08:20.918
just plunged a knife
into Lucy's thigh

08:20.919 --> 08:22.718
and you're acting
like it's business as usual.

08:22.719 --> 08:25.784
This should've been
a call to revolution.

08:25.785 --> 08:27.751
Should've been the stab
heard 'round the world.

08:27.752 --> 08:30.684
You can't hear a stab.
It's a fucking metaphor.
Of course you can't hear a stab.

08:30.685 --> 08:32.751
You look like shit.

08:32.751 --> 08:34.183
Not get any sleep last night?

08:34.184 --> 08:36.884
Fuck sleep. You know
what we should be doing?

08:36.885 --> 08:38.251
We should be tanking shit.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.884
You're not serious.
If we do it subtle,

08:39.885 --> 08:41.717
if we miss a number here
or there, if we do it right now,

08:41.719 --> 08:44.183
we can pull it off. Absolutely.
If we all work together, you are serious.

08:44.184 --> 08:46.351
If we all rise up at the
same time, we can take her down.

08:46.352 --> 08:47.418
I guarantee
we can take her down.

08:47.419 --> 08:49.718
Monica's our boss.
Crazy powerful,

08:49.719 --> 08:52.084
and I mean that not in the sense
of "very powerful,"

08:52.085 --> 08:55.284
which she is, but literally
bat-shit out of her mind.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.918
Let me plug that data

08:56.919 --> 08:59.084
in here.

08:59.085 --> 09:02.751
Oh. It says, "Good luck
working again, dumb-ass."

09:02.752 --> 09:03.818
You're fucking useless.

09:03.819 --> 09:05.284
You're trapped by a lion.

09:05.285 --> 09:07.318
You don't say, "Fuck you, lion."

09:07.319 --> 09:10.584
You play dead and pray to God
it doesn't eat you.

09:10.585 --> 09:13.051
When have you ever been
around a lion in your life? Sir Clyde.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.584
I thought that was you in here.
Look at this.

09:14.585 --> 09:18.284
Little Marty. Or should I say
way-bigger-than-Marty

09:18.285 --> 09:19.618
Little Marty?
What's good, man?

09:19.619 --> 09:22.284
Nothing much. You know,
I am seeing someone.

09:22.285 --> 09:25.018
Oh, you're seeing someone.
You know, I was actually

09:25.019 --> 09:26.651
getting something started
with a woman myself,

09:26.652 --> 09:29.818
but she ended up stabbing
your mom.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.351
It's always something, right?

09:31.352 --> 09:32.651
Right.

09:32.652 --> 09:33.784
Oh, hey, Dad.

09:33.785 --> 09:35.918
Hey, man. Go get your stuff.
All right.

09:35.919 --> 09:39.418
Didn't expect to see you.

09:39.419 --> 09:41.984
Well, when your fucking wife
has been...

09:41.985 --> 09:45.218
Yeah. I thought you
would've been somewhere

09:45.219 --> 09:47.384
lost in an eight-ball
on Kinsley's dime.

09:47.385 --> 09:48.951
Maybe I could be
recuperating properly

09:48.952 --> 09:50.518
if you hadn't fucked me
with Colossal Foods.

09:50.519 --> 09:53.151
- Aw, sorry about that.
- Fuck that.

09:53.152 --> 09:56.484
These goddamn
millennials, right? I mean,

09:56.485 --> 09:58.384
back in my day, when you shivved
your crazy-ass boss,

09:58.385 --> 10:00.918
you went for a vital organ

10:00.919 --> 10:03.518
and you twisted that fucker.
You didn't... The thigh?

10:03.519 --> 10:04.784
Not the thigh.
What is that?

10:04.785 --> 10:06.951
Mmm.
Uh...

10:06.952 --> 10:08.851
You would miss me if I was dead,

10:08.852 --> 10:10.218
huh?

10:10.219 --> 10:11.918
Ready, Dad. Bye, Mom.

10:11.919 --> 10:14.351
Later, Clyde.
Bye, baby. Mwah.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.285
Bye, Roscoe.

10:20.552 --> 10:23.718
For real?
Oh, my God. Excuse me.

10:23.719 --> 10:26.551
I don't even feel anything.

10:26.552 --> 10:29.084
It's crazy.

10:29.085 --> 10:30.818
<i>There'll be some restructuring,</i>

10:30.819 --> 10:32.918
of course, as we, you know,
integrate the...

10:32.919 --> 10:34.751
new faces with the old ones.
There'll be

10:34.752 --> 10:36.251
some shifting
of responsibilities

10:36.252 --> 10:40.251
and some shuffling of offices.

10:40.252 --> 10:42.318
But you know what? All that
can wait for another day.

10:42.319 --> 10:46.518
Today is about celebration,
as we triumph in this company's

10:46.519 --> 10:50.551
return to its glory days.

10:50.552 --> 10:52.884
To Galweather Stearn, the way

10:52.885 --> 10:54.518
that God intended it.

10:54.519 --> 10:56.352
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

11:00.485 --> 11:03.152
Now go forth and jihad!

11:07.219 --> 11:08.618
Oh, Jeannie.

11:08.619 --> 11:11.118
Uh, Jeannie, Jeannie, hey.

11:11.119 --> 11:12.552
Can I have a word?

11:27.685 --> 11:31.751
You know, for most of the last
year and a half, I've been a...

11:31.752 --> 11:33.651
a goddamn pariah.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.518
My friends, they wouldn't
even be seen with me,

11:36.519 --> 11:39.984
let alone, you know, hire me.

11:39.985 --> 11:42.451
I had to sell my vineyard.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.551
Did you know that?

11:43.552 --> 11:46.151
My lawyers tell me

11:46.152 --> 11:48.318
I can't even fire

11:48.319 --> 11:50.785
the stupid little cunt
that made all this happen.

11:53.419 --> 11:55.418
I... can I just say one thing?

11:55.419 --> 11:57.451
Mm-hmm.
These friends that couldn't hang

11:57.452 --> 11:59.551
with your dehumanization of...

11:59.552 --> 12:01.584
what was the final number...
16 women?...

12:01.585 --> 12:04.084
maybe they weren't your real friends
to begin with. Look, you know what?

12:04.085 --> 12:07.684
Don't feed me
that coercion bullshit.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.584
I didn't hold a gun
to any of your heads.

12:10.585 --> 12:11.884
You wanted to.

12:11.885 --> 12:15.784
Oh, God, yes.
The too-tight shirts,

12:15.785 --> 12:18.418
the thick, fetid breath,

12:18.419 --> 12:20.684
the snow white bush,

12:20.685 --> 12:22.951
we all just had to have it.

12:22.952 --> 12:26.851
I mean, what girl doesn't dream
of blowing Santa Claus?

12:26.852 --> 12:28.819
Hmm.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.184
I liked fucking you.

12:34.185 --> 12:36.984
But I'm gonna...

12:36.985 --> 12:38.818
really...

12:38.819 --> 12:40.652
like fucking you.

12:45.919 --> 12:48.151
I have a plane to catch.

12:48.152 --> 12:49.284
Colossal Foods.

12:49.285 --> 12:51.252
Oh, right.

12:53.685 --> 12:56.352
Well, go make Santa
a shitload of money.

12:58.352 --> 13:00.251
How did this happen?

13:00.252 --> 13:02.551
You think Gil reached out?

13:02.552 --> 13:05.684
I don't know. Maybe.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.184
I mean, even so,

13:07.185 --> 13:09.618
the Rainmaker?
That doesn't make any sense.

13:09.619 --> 13:12.018
It makes perfect sense, Doug.

13:12.019 --> 13:13.384
How?

13:13.385 --> 13:15.484
You know how a-a,
a football team

13:15.485 --> 13:17.684
will go through
a rebuilding phase?

13:17.685 --> 13:20.051
No, not...
A basketball team?

13:20.052 --> 13:22.184
Not really.
A baseball team?

13:22.185 --> 13:23.818
I don't get that game.

13:23.819 --> 13:26.718
Any team?
I'm more of a squash guy.

13:26.719 --> 13:28.284
Yeah. I can get
into squash. Or crew.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.384
Does the... does the analogy fit...
Teams...

13:30.385 --> 13:34.551
sometimes try to change the
ethos of the locker room

13:34.552 --> 13:38.218
by going to a youth movement or
bringing in "character guys."

13:38.219 --> 13:40.051
They lose a few too many games,

13:40.052 --> 13:41.851
and the next season
they open up their wallets

13:41.852 --> 13:43.751
and they buy a bunch
of all-stars.

13:43.752 --> 13:45.751
The Rainmaker and his cronies.
Correct, Doug.

13:45.752 --> 13:47.384
Okay.
The Rainmaker and his cronies.

13:47.385 --> 13:49.284
All right, so what do we do?

13:49.285 --> 13:52.484
I mean, apart from obviously
killing it today at Colossal.

13:52.485 --> 13:54.418
Right?

13:54.419 --> 13:57.485
I don't know.

13:59.519 --> 14:02.284
Hey. Here's a thought.

14:02.285 --> 14:06.951
What if I request a transfer
to Gil's pod?

14:06.952 --> 14:09.818
He's close to the Rainmaker.
That way, I can keep my eyes

14:09.819 --> 14:11.384
and ears out for you, make sure

14:11.385 --> 14:13.484
there-there are no nasty
surprises headed your way.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.418
Wow, your loyalty is
so impressive, Doug.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.818
Okay. I was just...
I get it. All right.

14:17.819 --> 14:20.351
No jumping ship.
Enough said. Yeah.

14:20.352 --> 14:23.352
With you to the bitter end.
Thank you.

14:26.885 --> 14:28.551
I mean, unless you say otherwise...
Doug.

14:28.552 --> 14:30.418
Okay. It's fine.

14:30.419 --> 14:33.251
So, I was just in the restroom.
I got to thinking... Gross.

14:33.252 --> 14:34.684
Julianne was obviously

14:34.685 --> 14:37.651
a political animal, very much
the accommodator type, but maybe

14:37.652 --> 14:40.584
this Rainmaker person would be
willing to play hardball

14:40.585 --> 14:43.084
with the DoD to get us into
compliance with federal law.

14:43.085 --> 14:44.851
We do great work. The DoD
would not want to lose...

14:44.852 --> 14:47.118
Shut up. Please,
Benita, just shut up

14:47.119 --> 14:49.351
and do your job. Okay?
Shut up.

14:49.352 --> 14:51.618
Why is that such a difficult
concept for you to grasp?

14:51.619 --> 14:53.451
Huh? Do what you were hired to do.
Why?

14:53.452 --> 14:54.884
Mind your own business.

14:54.885 --> 14:56.018
Now sit the fuck down.

14:56.019 --> 14:57.385
Yeah.

14:58.852 --> 15:02.185
Holy shit.

15:03.252 --> 15:05.218
<i>So, these rumblings,</i>

15:05.219 --> 15:07.551
are they just rumblings or what?
No, no, no.

15:07.552 --> 15:10.884
Ted Lasky has fast-tracked
his senior managers on this.

15:10.885 --> 15:13.251
Colossal Foods will have
a new brand up and running

15:13.252 --> 15:15.951
by early next year.
They don't give a shit about the Earth.

15:15.952 --> 15:17.884
I give a shit about the Earth.
I know, I know.

15:17.885 --> 15:20.084
I have made it my life's mission
to protect the Earth.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.218
I don't think Ted Lasky
even knows

15:22.219 --> 15:24.651
that's the planet we're on.
Look, don't worry about it, Robert, okay?

15:24.652 --> 15:26.084
We got you.

15:26.085 --> 15:28.351
Colossal is
a free market succubus

15:28.352 --> 15:31.084
with a slavish devotion
to the bottom line.

15:31.085 --> 15:35.184
Mm-hmm. And this guy's $40
million in salary last year

15:35.185 --> 15:38.051
is just the Earth's
way of saying thank you.

15:38.052 --> 15:41.051
No, this experiment of theirs
is gonna go up in flames.

15:41.052 --> 15:43.184
They have no feel for organics.

15:43.185 --> 15:45.051
There's no artistry there.

15:45.052 --> 15:46.284
No, let 'em burn.

15:46.285 --> 15:47.884
We're gonna keep doing
what we're doing,

15:47.885 --> 15:50.118
and we're gonna dance on their ashes.
Whoa. Wait-wait a minute.

15:50.119 --> 15:53.451
Uh, Robert, now, clearly they're philistines.
Yeah.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.618
They're pretenders.

15:54.619 --> 15:56.784
That's right.
Ted Lasky

15:56.785 --> 15:59.051
wouldn't know a goji berry
from a dingle berry.

15:59.052 --> 16:01.218
But... Do not help me.

16:01.219 --> 16:03.918
But the people are gonna see
a brand-spanking-new store

16:03.919 --> 16:06.218
at the end of their street.
It's gonna be called,

16:06.219 --> 16:09.151
I don't know, Fresh N Organic
or Golden Meadows

16:09.152 --> 16:11.651
or whatever the fuck
their high-priced market testers

16:11.652 --> 16:14.318
spit out of their
word-combining algorithm.

16:14.319 --> 16:16.184
The design of the store,

16:16.185 --> 16:19.751
the signage... it will look
like Free Range Foods.

16:19.752 --> 16:21.618
And they're gonna set their
prices just a little bit lower

16:21.619 --> 16:24.284
than yours, and they're
gonna keep 'em there

16:24.285 --> 16:26.918
until the only fresh produce
you have in the store's gonna be

16:26.919 --> 16:29.784
that tumbleweed rolling down
the aisle where the frozen food

16:29.785 --> 16:32.351
used to be.
Nah, the consumer's smarter than that.

16:32.352 --> 16:33.351
Come on.
What?

16:33.352 --> 16:34.518
They're gonna see through it?

16:34.519 --> 16:35.484
Yeah.
Come on.

16:35.485 --> 16:36.718
Are you kidding me, Robert?

16:36.719 --> 16:38.351
Fucking sheeple?

16:38.352 --> 16:41.884
Come on... Americans...
Fucking Everywhere-icans,

16:41.885 --> 16:44.784
They're gonna go for the lowest
common denominator every time.

16:44.785 --> 16:46.584
You know that.

16:46.585 --> 16:49.984
Listen, when you started
this company,

16:49.985 --> 16:52.984
you took the people by the hand.
Yeah.

16:52.985 --> 16:54.951
That's right. You introduced
them to quinoa

16:54.952 --> 16:58.184
and-and kombucha and twig tea.
Yeah.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.684
You opened their eyes.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.118
The revolution isn't over, baby.

17:02.119 --> 17:04.318
Let us help you.

17:04.319 --> 17:08.085
Okay? Because better
still matters.

17:10.752 --> 17:12.050
Let's give it a shot.

17:12.051 --> 17:14.018
Okay.

17:14.019 --> 17:17.718
Where the fuck
are they?! That's it.

17:17.719 --> 17:21.218
Which one of you stole
my fucking drugs?

17:21.219 --> 17:22.951
Huh?
That's professional.

17:22.952 --> 17:24.684
Huh? I know
it was one of you.

17:24.685 --> 17:26.284
Turn your pockets inside out. I want to see
Oh, my God.

17:26.285 --> 17:28.851
What is inside your pockets.
Hey, crazy lady,

17:28.852 --> 17:30.584
nobody stole your fucking drugs,
all right?

17:30.585 --> 17:32.384
Is it possible that maybe

17:32.385 --> 17:33.952
you just forgot
where you put them?

17:35.185 --> 17:37.151
Now.

17:37.152 --> 17:38.984
Open up your pockets.

17:38.985 --> 17:40.551
Really?

17:40.552 --> 17:42.584
Are you seriously
taking your pockets?

17:42.585 --> 17:43.484
That's it.

17:43.485 --> 17:45.651
I'm done.
You're fucking insane,

17:45.652 --> 17:47.418
okay? I'm out. Have a good life.
Hmm.

17:47.419 --> 17:49.851
You should probably wait
for an actual offer from Booz

17:49.852 --> 17:52.351
before you quit this job.

17:52.352 --> 17:54.718
Yep. I know about
your interview,

17:54.719 --> 17:57.551
and I think that they're gonna
hire somebody else.

17:57.552 --> 17:59.418
Call it a hunch.

17:59.419 --> 18:01.884
You will learn to love me.

18:01.885 --> 18:03.951
Or not.
Either way,

18:03.952 --> 18:06.285
you're mine forever!

18:09.085 --> 18:11.785
Where the <i> fuck</i> are my drugs?!

18:21.919 --> 18:24.284
Will, you are making
my scone uncomfortable.

18:24.285 --> 18:25.918
Those brown bits,
are they bacon?

18:25.919 --> 18:28.418
I skipped breakfast
or I'd give it to you.

18:28.419 --> 18:30.118
I wasn't asking. It's cool.

18:30.119 --> 18:32.518
The orange on top though,
that's cheddar?

18:32.519 --> 18:34.184
Cheddar. Mmm.
Cheddar. Yes,

18:34.185 --> 18:36.018
it compliments...
All right, kiddies,

18:36.019 --> 18:38.884
what do we got? Talk to me.
All right, Free Range should threaten

18:38.885 --> 18:41.418
to drop their small providers
if they sell to the new entity.

18:41.419 --> 18:44.951
Ding, ding, ding.
Yeah. We wrap our fingers around all their

18:44.952 --> 18:46.684
scrawny little necks.

18:46.685 --> 18:48.019
And just squeeze.

18:50.119 --> 18:52.651
Yeah. Um... anything?

18:52.652 --> 18:54.718
We identify where Colossal
intends to convert stores

18:54.719 --> 18:55.951
and build new Free Ranges

18:55.952 --> 18:58.218
in those areas.
Wow.

18:58.219 --> 18:59.184
Wait. Question:

18:59.185 --> 19:01.751
How much longer
do you think it would take

19:01.752 --> 19:03.218
to find a new location,

19:03.219 --> 19:05.284
purchase it, build a store,

19:05.285 --> 19:06.851
as opposed to just, you know,

19:06.852 --> 19:08.218
converting
an existing supermarket?

19:08.219 --> 19:10.151
A lot longer.
Uh...

19:10.152 --> 19:13.118
a fuck of a lot longer. Okay?
That's one point

19:13.119 --> 19:15.584
for Will. One point for Jeffrey,
not because

19:15.585 --> 19:17.218
you added anything
of any value, really,

19:17.219 --> 19:19.184
but just because, you know,

19:19.185 --> 19:20.851
you legitimately scare the fuck
out of me.

19:20.852 --> 19:24.818
And one big ol' giant, organic,
cage-free goose egg

19:24.819 --> 19:27.251
for the cutie from Connecticut.

19:27.252 --> 19:29.551
If you're not gonna eat that,
I will take it.

19:29.552 --> 19:31.418
You idiot!

19:31.419 --> 19:34.118
You fucking moron!
Hold it. What's the problem?

19:34.119 --> 19:36.184
Colossal isn't doing
a brand conversion.

19:36.185 --> 19:39.284
They are wrapping us
in a goddamn

19:39.285 --> 19:40.252
bear hug!

19:42.685 --> 19:46.251
Holy fucking... a bear hug?

19:46.252 --> 19:48.651
Okay, kiddies,

19:48.652 --> 19:52.184
a bear hug
is a hostile takeover bid

19:52.185 --> 19:55.085
in which a big scary
fucking company...

19:59.552 --> 20:02.485
...makes an offer
for a smaller company...

20:07.552 --> 20:10.218
...that far exceeds
that company's value.

20:10.219 --> 20:12.918
Now, the little guy
has a fiduciary obligation

20:12.919 --> 20:14.784
to take care of
shareholder interests,

20:14.785 --> 20:17.852
and with so many of these
things floating in the air...

20:19.019 --> 20:20.751
...the little guy
has no choice

20:20.752 --> 20:21.884
but to accept the deal.

20:21.885 --> 20:23.851
At which point

20:23.852 --> 20:25.718
the big ol' scary bear,

20:25.719 --> 20:27.018
his tummy full,

20:27.019 --> 20:28.851
curls up for
a nice winter's nap,

20:28.852 --> 20:30.919
and the little guy...

20:39.652 --> 20:41.184
What the fuck, Jeannie?

20:41.185 --> 20:42.718
Huh?!

20:42.719 --> 20:45.919
What... the... fuck?

20:49.052 --> 20:51.251
Okay, just...
just take it easy, Robert.

20:51.252 --> 20:52.484
All is not lost.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.584
Let me make a phone call...

20:53.585 --> 20:56.184
No, how about instead
you eat my ass!

20:56.185 --> 20:57.752
It is organic, right?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.118
It's not the moment for that.

21:00.119 --> 21:01.651
Oh...

21:01.652 --> 21:02.618
Robert...

21:02.619 --> 21:04.284
Oh, motherfucker!

21:04.285 --> 21:05.552
That's a...
Fuck!

21:11.419 --> 21:13.119
Hi, you've reached Jeannie...

21:16.785 --> 21:17.752
Hey...

21:20.085 --> 21:21.951
Huh.

21:21.952 --> 21:23.984
That's weird, I have two
missed calls from Marty.

21:23.985 --> 21:25.785
Why would he be calling me?

21:27.152 --> 21:29.418
Oh, my God, maybe he heard
about the Rainmaker.

21:29.419 --> 21:31.751
Jeannie, he could be
offering us a lifeboat.

21:31.752 --> 21:34.451
Or... he could be calling
for social reasons.

21:34.452 --> 21:36.451
I mean, I have dropped
a few subtle hints over the years

21:36.452 --> 21:37.484
that a get-together

21:37.485 --> 21:40.018
outside of work
could be intriguing.

21:40.019 --> 21:41.418
Do you think it's possible

21:41.419 --> 21:43.018
he's finally responding?
I don't know, Doug.

21:43.019 --> 21:45.684
Why don't you ask him yourself?

21:45.685 --> 21:47.651
Whatever the question is,

21:47.652 --> 21:49.584
the answer is "yes."

21:49.585 --> 21:51.418
Doug... God, you look good.
It's good to see you.

21:51.419 --> 21:53.284
That was...
Doug, um...

21:53.285 --> 21:55.451
Marty and I
need a minute, okay?

21:55.452 --> 21:57.918
Why don't you go
buy yourself a soda?

21:57.919 --> 21:59.918
Uh... I'm not
an eight-year-old,

21:59.919 --> 22:01.819
Jeannie.

22:03.652 --> 22:04.884
We'll talk later.

22:04.885 --> 22:06.151
Come on.

22:06.152 --> 22:07.751
You should hold up a sign
with my name on it.

22:07.752 --> 22:10.051
I almost walked right past you.

22:10.052 --> 22:11.451
How was Phoenix?

22:11.452 --> 22:13.518
Cold. I mean,
I understand it's January,

22:13.519 --> 22:15.879
but still, you figure it's Phoenix...
Cut the shit, Jeannie.

22:16.785 --> 22:18.184
Hostile takeover?

22:18.185 --> 22:19.351
That's how we're doing it now?

22:19.352 --> 22:20.984
You fucking kidding me?

22:20.985 --> 22:24.584
When I said the words
"bear hug" to Ted Lasky,

22:24.585 --> 22:27.151
it gave him a huge
business boner.

22:27.152 --> 22:28.651
He hates your guy.

22:28.652 --> 22:30.051
Yeah, well, he's not
my guy anymore.

22:30.052 --> 22:31.518
I figured as much.

22:31.519 --> 22:33.418
Ted Lasky, on the other hand...

22:33.419 --> 22:35.484
he thinks I am a fucking god,

22:35.485 --> 22:37.351
and not one of
the minor gods, either.

22:37.352 --> 22:38.318
A serious deity.

22:38.319 --> 22:39.551
Athena was a big one, right?

22:39.552 --> 22:40.984
You know what?
Fuck you, Jeannie.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.784
You and the Rainmaker
deserve each other.

22:42.785 --> 22:44.184
Language.

22:44.185 --> 22:46.384
God, what's your new pod,
a bunch of sailors?

22:46.385 --> 22:49.118
My point... if you'll
let me finish, Marty...

22:49.119 --> 22:52.551
is that Ted Lasky

22:52.552 --> 22:55.284
would follow me to hell.

22:55.285 --> 22:59.518
Or even Kaan & Associates.

22:59.519 --> 23:01.818
You know, you might've
led with that.

23:01.819 --> 23:03.752
I like watching you squirm.

23:05.019 --> 23:07.118
I've kept an office
open for you, so...

23:07.119 --> 23:08.518
That's kind of pathetic.

23:08.519 --> 23:09.951
Well, you're filling it,

23:09.952 --> 23:11.551
so let's just say it
was forward-thinking.

23:11.552 --> 23:12.884
Yeah. Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

23:12.885 --> 23:14.651
I have terms.
I know.

23:14.652 --> 23:16.684
You were grossly underpaid
at Galweather Stearn...

23:16.685 --> 23:18.751
I'm not looking
for a giant payday.

23:18.752 --> 23:19.985
Okay.

23:21.785 --> 23:23.851
I want what you have.

23:23.852 --> 23:25.951
I want parity.

23:25.952 --> 23:28.084
You want the same equity
in the firm as me?

23:28.085 --> 23:29.051
Oh!

23:29.052 --> 23:31.085
Good, you know what parity is.

23:32.319 --> 23:35.218
I had someone check
into your books.

23:35.219 --> 23:37.318
Congratulations, Marty.

23:37.319 --> 23:39.918
You are pulling in
a considerable amount

23:39.919 --> 23:41.784
in fees.

23:41.785 --> 23:43.318
Very impressive top line
for a baby startup.

23:43.319 --> 23:44.451
Thank you.

23:44.452 --> 23:47.551
But you still are
a tiny, baby startup,

23:47.552 --> 23:50.084
and I know you're
shelling out a fortune

23:50.085 --> 23:52.551
to give that place
the shine you need

23:52.552 --> 23:55.518
to sell success.

23:55.519 --> 23:59.618
Losing Free Range
will be devastating.

23:59.619 --> 24:01.918
You'd have to make
significant layoffs,

24:01.919 --> 24:04.751
or dig deep in your pockets
to keep the firm afloat,

24:04.752 --> 24:06.851
and Colossal would more
than offset that loss.

24:06.852 --> 24:09.918
But... that's not why

24:09.919 --> 24:11.919
you should give me
the keys to the candy shop.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.452
You left your flank open.

24:19.185 --> 24:20.551
I could've gutted you.

24:20.552 --> 24:22.218
I did gut you.

24:22.219 --> 24:25.884
Colossal and its
$30 million in fees aside,

24:25.885 --> 24:28.151
you need someone at that firm

24:28.152 --> 24:30.152
who will have their eyes
open when you don't.

24:31.352 --> 24:33.184
Wow.

24:33.185 --> 24:34.951
Shark Jeannie has teeth.

24:34.952 --> 24:36.684
Is that a yes?

24:36.685 --> 24:38.184
Well, if she has to ask,

24:38.185 --> 24:40.552
maybe Shark Jeannie's
just little Minnow Jeannie.

24:43.919 --> 24:44.918
Good.

24:44.919 --> 24:47.851
Good.

24:47.852 --> 24:49.318
Come on, let's go celebrate.

24:49.319 --> 24:50.518
There's a Quiznos
in Terminal...

24:50.519 --> 24:51.852
I just want to be
clear, Marty...

24:52.719 --> 24:54.684
...that this is
a business decision.

24:54.685 --> 24:57.018
Purely.

24:57.019 --> 24:59.184
While our interests
coincide at the moment,

24:59.185 --> 25:01.651
I will not hesitate
to throw you under the bus

25:01.652 --> 25:03.085
if it serves me in the future.

25:04.552 --> 25:06.385
So no toasted subs?

25:28.219 --> 25:29.284
Oh.

25:29.285 --> 25:30.584
Heard about Colossal Foods.
Big win.

25:30.585 --> 25:31.918
Yeah.

25:31.919 --> 25:34.251
You know what amuses me?

25:34.252 --> 25:37.219
It's what I find goddamn
hysterical, actually.

25:38.819 --> 25:40.451
You think that this
is gonna save you.

25:40.452 --> 25:42.851
You are off Colossal.

25:42.852 --> 25:45.951
You are off DoD.

25:45.952 --> 25:49.318
You are off fuckin' everything.

25:49.319 --> 25:50.819
I get it.

25:51.785 --> 25:53.052
I have been...

25:55.252 --> 25:57.384
...a bad little girl,

25:57.385 --> 26:00.284
and I just hope
that there's some way

26:00.285 --> 26:01.818
I can win back your trust.

26:01.819 --> 26:04.352
Someday.

26:07.652 --> 26:08.618
I'm sorry.
Were we done?

26:08.619 --> 26:10.652
Yeah.

26:11.652 --> 26:12.952
Yeah...

26:14.019 --> 26:15.052
Benita?

26:19.552 --> 26:22.151
I want to apologize
for what I said.

26:22.152 --> 26:24.451
The changes around here
just got me all out of sorts.

26:24.452 --> 26:25.518
You don't have to...

26:25.519 --> 26:26.651
I do. I do.

26:26.652 --> 26:27.884
This business,

26:27.885 --> 26:29.651
and the things we do,

26:29.652 --> 26:32.684
and the people
that we work with...

26:32.685 --> 26:34.318
It's almost impossible

26:34.319 --> 26:36.285
to get out of it unscathed.

26:37.319 --> 26:39.684
It's certainly hardened me.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.184
I don't want to give
you a big head,

26:41.185 --> 26:43.151
but I do see a little bit

26:43.152 --> 26:44.918
of who I used to be in you.

26:44.919 --> 26:46.551
Wow.

26:46.552 --> 26:48.184
I wish I could get that...

26:48.185 --> 26:49.318
girl back.

26:49.319 --> 26:51.285
She's still in there, Jeannie.

26:52.685 --> 26:54.318
Look, the Department of Defense

26:54.319 --> 26:55.951
is not gonna change
the way they do business

26:55.952 --> 26:57.251
just because we ask them to.

26:57.252 --> 26:59.384
And knowing the Rainmaker,
he's not gonna ask.

26:59.385 --> 27:00.918
Shit.

27:00.919 --> 27:02.418
Let me see your phone.

27:02.419 --> 27:04.084
Why?

27:04.085 --> 27:05.451
Just...

27:05.452 --> 27:06.918
Um...

27:06.919 --> 27:09.184
my college roommate
is a great girl.

27:09.185 --> 27:10.184
You would love her.

27:10.185 --> 27:12.384
She works at
The <i> New York Times.</i>

27:12.385 --> 27:14.151
She's a reporter, and if you

27:14.152 --> 27:16.318
tell her even half

27:16.319 --> 27:18.451
of what you told me
about the DoD's

27:18.452 --> 27:20.384
flagrant disregard
for the U.S. Constitution,

27:20.385 --> 27:21.918
it... it would
be front page.

27:21.919 --> 27:23.551
But I...

27:23.552 --> 27:24.618
I mean...

27:24.619 --> 27:25.918
This could take down
Galweather Stearn.

27:25.919 --> 27:28.318
They made their bed, Benita.

27:28.319 --> 27:30.618
Now, I know what
I'm asking you to do

27:30.619 --> 27:31.951
takes a whole mess of courage,

27:31.952 --> 27:34.184
but for girls
like us... I mean,

27:34.185 --> 27:35.351
is there any other choice?

27:35.352 --> 27:37.551
We are women of good character,

27:37.552 --> 27:40.618
and if we lose sight of that...

27:40.619 --> 27:41.952
God save our souls.

28:08.719 --> 28:10.985
Boom.
