00:07.800 --> 00:11.520
Hi, Jamie. We heard you and your friends
are working for some serious criminals.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.640
What?

00:12.760 --> 00:16.120
Is this Lee? He works for
a company called CTIP.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.040
They work on drainage,
the infrastructure under London.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.640
Tommy has an old injury.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.240
- His liver is in serious trouble.
- You've done your job. Close him up.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.840
People pay for good news.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.400
This is the name
of a specialist here in London.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.120
If you could give this note to Tommy,

00:35.240 --> 00:37.320
tell him I referred him
and tell him to go straight away.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.080
It's not your conventional,
all-white, clean-looking clinic, no.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.560
- Dennis has vomited.
- Twice.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.000
So, we're leaving.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.120
Just wanna give you something.
It'll make you feel better.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.440
You want to bring the tub to a standstill?

00:48.680 --> 00:51.040
- So, is that a yes?
- But not to that plan.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.480
What if I said we could gridlock
the whole of central London, if you like?

00:54.600 --> 00:57.080
- Easy as that?
- We just need to pick up a key.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.840
Daniel.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.000
Glad you could make it.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.040
I hope your journey
wasn't too arduous.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.520
You're joking, right?

02:24.880 --> 02:27.520
You just kidnapped me.
What the hell is going on?

02:28.240 --> 02:30.280
I need your help, as a friend.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.720
- No way.
- Please let's not fuck around.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.280
The clock is ticking.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.280
Besides,
this isn't actually a request.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.200
- So, what is this?
- You're under an obligation, Daniel.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.280
Look, you said you were
all about the professional, right?

02:43.400 --> 02:45.280
This, this is not professional.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.400
This is the foremost equestrian
medical center in the country.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.840
There's nothing unprofessional here.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.880
Now, if you want to get yourself
prepared for surgery,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.440
there's a sink
and some scrubs in the corner.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.320
Help me.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.480
All right.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.240
This is Paul, he's been having
quite severe chest pains.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.920
Paul, can you hear me?
I'm Dr. Milton. What happened to you?

03:25.560 --> 03:28.120
- I got shot.
- Dermot will assist you.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.160
Just to let you know,
I've actually been struck off.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.400
But you know how these
things are, very political.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.560
Have you been drinking?

03:48.520 --> 03:50.080
Why have you made no attempt
to stop the bleeding?

03:50.200 --> 03:54.160
- The man's in a critical condition.
- Help me, please. I'm scared.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.640
I don't wanna die.

03:57.440 --> 04:01.680
- Are you gonna wash up or what?
- I'm not your personal fucling physician.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.800
Dr. Milton's a fine surgeon, which is why
I put up with his recalcitrant attitude.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.880
It means truculent and uncooperative!

04:11.120 --> 04:15.200
- Am I gonna die?
- Well, obviously the hope is not, Paul.

04:18.840 --> 04:21.080
- The hope is not.
- I don't wanna die.

04:22.880 --> 04:27.200
It looks bad, but I'm a good surgeon.
If you have any questions, please...

04:27.600 --> 04:29.800
address it to Dermot there
while I get ready.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.200
I have a wee flask,
if you'd like something for the pain.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.280
No, he doesn't need your flask.
He needs morphine.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.200
Morphine is better.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.480
TEMPLE

05:52.520 --> 05:53.800
Hello there.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.000
Is there a problem
with the reactor core?

06:06.560 --> 06:08.360
- What?
- The getup.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.200
Rats.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.240
Rats?

06:18.880 --> 06:22.080
Yeah. We've been sent by CTIP
to get rid of them.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.560
- Where?
- In the basement. There's a nest.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.280
Behind the...

06:29.560 --> 06:31.040
key cupboard.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.800
Go on, then.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.760
Jeremy wants me to meet him
in his office in 15 minutes.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.360
What? I thought he was out today.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.840
You don't think it's about this?

06:48.960 --> 06:50.280
- No.
- No way.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.520
- No, no, no.
- No.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.960
No, definitely no.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.080
- Still.
- Still what?

06:56.200 --> 07:01.000
Still, probably best hurry.
We don't want him to suspect anything.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.560
Bye.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.160
Let's go.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.920
He's got no output.
He's not gonna make it.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.480
Come on.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.720
This is all I can do for him.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.600
A valiant attempt.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.200
"A" for effort,
but it looks like Paul's time was up.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.680
Poor kid.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.320
Okay.

08:12.160 --> 08:17.280
So, let's move on to the
other business of the day.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.040
- Wha... No, no, no. I'm done.
- We need to remove his liver.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.600
Yeah.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.640
You might as well take the kidneys too,
no point leaving money on the table.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.680
So... What was all this about, then?

08:33.400 --> 08:36.080
- Was that just for my benefit?
- Well, and Paul, surely.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.920
What, and all the while,
you were just gonna strip him for parts?

08:39.040 --> 08:41.920
Don't be so sanctimonious, Daniel.
I'd have be as happy as anyone

08:42.040 --> 08:43.480
if you'd have managed to save Paul,

08:43.600 --> 08:47.040
but as it stands, we have another patient
waiting for a liver transplant.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.360
- There he is.
- You remember Tommy.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.400
- My personal physician.
- You left him a note, after all.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.880
I'm just gonna go to the toilet
and let yous guys get on with it.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.040
The only man I trust with my life.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.880
- It's good to see you, Tommy.
- Doctor.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.400
Would you excuse me a moment?

09:14.080 --> 09:16.520
Listen, I don't think you understand
quite how complicated...

09:16.640 --> 09:18.840
Paul's liver is a complete
match for Tommy's.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.560
All the relevant tests
have been carried out.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.760
- It tested he was a match?
- Yes.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.840
When?

09:28.360 --> 09:31.640
Before or after he was shot
multiple times?

09:39.520 --> 09:40.840
After.

09:42.560 --> 09:46.840
- I won't be complicit in this.
- Don't be so bourgeois, Daniel.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.680
You will carry out this surgery.

09:53.080 --> 09:57.080
Because if you don't, you'll have yet
another body on your conscience.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.960
Surely you don't want that.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.320
- I can't do it on my own.
- Dermot will assist.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.840
Dermot?

10:15.440 --> 10:16.920
Where is he?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.240
Dermot.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.240
Dermot.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.000
He's fine.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.680
- You're not meant to be here.
- I'm sorry?

11:08.360 --> 11:10.400
This room's
meant to be free.

11:11.200 --> 11:17.040
Supposed to be on a standby for the next
two hours on a... cleaning rotation.

11:17.280 --> 11:21.000
Not till tonight.
Sorry, who exactly are you?

11:21.240 --> 11:25.920
We're exterminators.
There's rats behind the key cupboard.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.080
Behind the cupboard?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.760
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that cupboard right there.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.360
In the rock?

11:34.600 --> 11:38.120
They could gnaw for anything,
mate, they're disgusting.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.480
On you go, then.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.840
Thank you.

11:58.720 --> 12:03.440
- Can you give us the room?
- Yeah, sorry, this stuff's pretty toxic.

12:03.840 --> 12:08.200
- I can't, I have to be here.
- What did the guy do at the other place?

12:08.360 --> 12:09.440
The guy?

12:09.560 --> 12:10.840
-Yeah, he...
-Over...

12:10.960 --> 12:12.760
- Over by the...
- The thing.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.040
The guy, yeah.

12:14.160 --> 12:18.440
I think he just went out on his lunch,
didn't he? He activated the...

12:18.920 --> 12:21.160
- Lunch protocol.
-The lunch protocol.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.120
The lunch protocol.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.280
Boss, if you could
duck out for a sandwich,

12:25.400 --> 12:28.680
you can duck out, just be yourself,
permanent lung damage.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.520
And impotence.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.800
Impotent?

12:37.680 --> 12:40.320
The fumes would clear
in about an hour, so...

12:50.400 --> 12:52.320
Don't touch me!

12:54.560 --> 12:56.400
Doctor! Doctor!

12:57.720 --> 12:59.280
I want the gas.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.880
Give me the gas mask.
I want the gas.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.840
Good God.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.920
Do we have the right
kind of gas?

13:09.040 --> 13:11.880
- Sorry?
- Do we have the right kind of gas?

13:12.760 --> 13:17.240
- I don't even know if...
- I want the gas!

13:18.680 --> 13:24.160
- And I don't want this guy near me.
- Right. Dermot, you take over.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.760
I'll take Tommy.
Source another form of anesthetic, okay?

13:54.360 --> 13:55.640
Here.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.360
We've received
an inquiry from the police.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.280
- Oh, what? Yeah, okay.
- It's not uncommon.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.720
So much of our network
being under the ground,

14:05.840 --> 14:09.840
it attracts those drawn to morally
subterranean pursuits.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.880
Okay.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.480
Well, sit down.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.600
So, obviously you're still very green?

14:19.720 --> 14:22.880
- Sure.
- But the only way to learn is to do.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.440
So I've arranged for you
to show them around the tunnels.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.320
Okay.

14:28.520 --> 14:32.640
So, you need to meet Detective
Sergeant Moloney. In town, today.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.000
At the Kingsway entrance. Show him
the tunnels under Temple Station.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.360
- Today?
- Yes, today.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.960
- He's waiting for you now.
- Okay.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.480
Good. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.680
One, two, three.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.480
So...

15:11.000 --> 15:14.040
how are we supposed to know
what key we're looking for?

15:15.800 --> 15:18.280
I'm not afraid of pain, doctor.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.160
I just don't like needles.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.640
What is that?

15:26.600 --> 15:31.440
It's a horse hospital, so if you don't
like injections, I'm afraid this is it.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.640
- Like this?
- Yeah, see if it fits.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.800
What was that?

16:01.440 --> 16:03.200
Count backwards from 100.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.400
Let's take all the keys.
All right? Fuck it.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.640
Fill up the bag and we can work out
when we get out of here.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.840
They'd notice. Yeah? They'd change
all the locks on all the electrical boxes.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.360
They're paranoid about terrorism.
We're fucked.

16:54.720 --> 16:59.040
It doesn't hurt to look. See if you can
make any sense over here.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.960
What?
I'm not Alan bloody Turing, am I?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.760
It seems to be three
letters and a number.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.040
Like this.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.840
TL... T9 and 6.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.000
They all start with TL.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.280
- Transport London.
- Doubt it.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.160
Shit, what that?

17:22.360 --> 17:23.440
Some...

17:23.760 --> 17:26.160
Bunch of buttons,
and one of them is flashing red.

17:26.680 --> 17:30.960
They've also got "TL" written on them,
too, and then a number.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.800
It's...

17:35.160 --> 17:36.360
TL...

17:38.520 --> 17:40.920
That's what TL means.
Transit layer.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.760
Try pushing the red button.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.160
- Yeah?
- Push it.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.480
Okay, so that's a map reference.
Transit layer, T9.

17:55.960 --> 18:00.080
Square 9 on the transit layer map
which must correspond...

18:00.800 --> 18:04.120
...to where the electrical
transmission units are located.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.080
That's it.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.960
Have you cracked it?
Have you done it?

18:10.400 --> 18:12.440
I am bloody Alan Turing.

18:13.840 --> 18:18.240
Which means that the key
that we need is TLK5.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.520
I'd say K for Kingsway.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.600
It's...

18:22.720 --> 18:25.760
But then I'm not certain
if it's 2, 3...

18:27.720 --> 18:29.200
or 4.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.160
I don't really know.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.400
I think that's everything worth taking.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.440
Not a bad haul,
considering his condition.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.720
But before we bring
your man over,

18:49.920 --> 18:52.120
we should get rid
of the rest of this fella.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.000
No, I'm... I'm a surgeon,
not a janitor.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.320
That's right, you're a surgeon.

18:58.160 --> 19:01.360
A surgeon in a horse hospital.
Harvesting body parts.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.360
- Get over yourself.
- Look, I tried to save his life.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.080
I'm not gonna make myself an accessory
to disposing of his body.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.720
Stop being so hysterical. Nobody's asking
to roll him up in a bit of carpet

19:11.840 --> 19:13.960
and dump him under your front porch.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.880
And stop fecking about
and get an end.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.160
Come on.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.960
- Come on. They won't miss three...
- Time's up, guys.

19:43.720 --> 19:47.480
Mate, can you just give us
five more minutes?

19:49.240 --> 19:52.200
- Can I just wait in here?
- We just need five minutes more.

19:52.440 --> 19:56.320
Then we're gone and you can get back
to your monitors rat-free.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.720
No, I need to get back
to my terminals now.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.120
We just need five minutes.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.160
Come on, guys,
I've given you enough time.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.360
We're about to tear off
the impotence pump.

20:04.480 --> 20:05.960
No, you're not.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.920
Fucking hell.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.320
You came prepared.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.720
Have you ever operated
an incinerator before?

20:53.360 --> 20:56.680
I'm not the sort of doctor
who does incinerations, all right?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.040
Let me remind you
that we are responsible

20:59.160 --> 21:00.640
for ensuring that that young man

21:01.480 --> 21:05.280
receives treatment as dignified
as any human being might expect.

21:06.640 --> 21:11.360
And let me also remind you
that he died on our operating table.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.560
Look, if you want me to say a few words,
mark my respect or something,

21:19.200 --> 21:20.400
happy to.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.240
Anything other than that,
that's your department.

21:23.720 --> 21:24.800
All right.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.200
You are joking.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.560
Why would anyone joke
about something as serious as this?

21:48.400 --> 21:49.800
All right.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.840
End is in beginning...

21:55.800 --> 21:57.840
And in beginning end:

21:59.320 --> 22:02.480
Death is not loss, nor life winning;

22:03.640 --> 22:05.800
But each and to each is friend.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.240
The hands which give are taking;

22:11.920 --> 22:14.240
And the hands which take bestow:

22:15.720 --> 22:17.880
Always the bough is breaking

22:19.520 --> 22:21.960
Heavy with fruit or snow.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.040
I reckon we're gonna have
to stick him in arse first.

22:37.160 --> 22:40.560
Otherwise we're gonna
have to just chop the fecker up.

23:22.960 --> 23:23.960
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you...

23:24.080 --> 23:26.120
- Yeah, Eve. Hi.
- I'm DS Moloney.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.160
You're the tunnel expert, yeah?

23:28.440 --> 23:30.360
I've been looking at the maps
you guys sent over,

23:30.760 --> 23:33.440
so I have a sort of vague idea
of where I wanna go,

23:33.560 --> 23:36.160
but hopefully you'll be able
to keep me right.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.640
I'm not really
much of an expert.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.600
- I'm honest.
- I'm sure that's not true.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.600
After you.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.800
- I insist.
- I have a police badge.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.920
I've got a lanyard.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.880
- Can I see that?
- Sir, is something wrong?

23:52.680 --> 23:57.160
- Milton. It's a unusual name.
- Yeah, I suppose it is.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.200
- Anyway, shall we?
- Yeah.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.520
Am I allowed to ask
what it is you're looking for?

24:12.160 --> 24:15.080
- You can ask.
- What are you looking for?

24:15.560 --> 24:18.520
Not exactly sure.
Hoping I'll know it when I see it.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.880
Right. It is a crime
you're investigating, though?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.800
Yeah. Nothing you need
to worry about though.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.520
- No, I'm not worried.
- What's through here?

24:34.120 --> 24:36.320
Through there? Nothing.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.600
I'd like to take a look.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.600
I need to nip to the toilet
before we begin.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.240
No.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.680
- What?
- No. We're gonna get this done.

25:03.720 --> 25:07.920
- But I need to piss.
- Well, that's good. It'll keep you alert.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.680
Making the incision.

25:19.840 --> 25:22.280
Dermot, I need
you to concentrate.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.280
Don't worry about Dermot.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.120
Worry about your family.

25:29.760 --> 25:33.040
- What did you say?
- Beth and Eve.

25:34.680 --> 25:38.240
Worry about them.
I mean, it must be a worry, right?

25:38.440 --> 25:43.240
What with Eve dropping out of university
and Beth dying.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.560
You mad cow.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.360
You drugged me.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.440
I know.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.680
But... it worked.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.640
- Rebecca, the bloods are normal.
- Are you serious?

27:06.840 --> 27:07.960
Yeah.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.280
What's that?

27:25.080 --> 27:28.640
- Let me know if the pressures change.
- Will do.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.480
- It's like a ballet.
- That's the donor liver grafted.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.280
So, what, are you done?
Is it a success?

27:41.840 --> 27:43.080
Not yet.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.160
Now for the tricky bit.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.720
What are you doing?

28:06.840 --> 28:08.680
Please shut up. Shut up, please.
Can you just...

28:08.800 --> 28:09.880
Call an ambulance.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.040
Shut up! I cannot hear myself think.
Can you please shut up?

28:13.400 --> 28:16.680
I just need to... I need to focus.
It's all gonna be fine.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.640
Come, let's go.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.480
- Go on your right.
- Come on.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.520
Go, go.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.800
- We did it.
- Oh, my God!

28:53.760 --> 28:56.400
Keep going!
We fucking did it!

29:01.160 --> 29:02.160
You all right?

29:02.280 --> 29:05.760
Yes! The freaking smoke!
Oh, my God, Lee, the freaking smoke!

29:09.040 --> 29:10.880
Hello. What's up?

29:15.840 --> 29:17.080
What?

29:20.240 --> 29:21.520
You a local?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.240
Yeah. Me too.

29:24.840 --> 29:28.400
Well, Watford.
But Watford's London now, isn't it?

29:32.320 --> 29:34.440
Oh, my God, what is that?

29:35.040 --> 29:37.080
- What?
- I think that's a Banksy.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.760
- Where?
- Right there.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.600
Nah. That's not a Banksy.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.600
- No?
- Definitely no.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.200
Yeah, you're probably right.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.360
Do you think you've seen
everything you need to see?

29:54.920 --> 29:57.360
- Yeah, I think so.
- Great.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.400
All done?

30:04.880 --> 30:08.800
I leave the patient's post-operative care
in your hands. I'm going home.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.560
Goodbye, Dermot. Gubby.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.360
See you later, Daniel Milton.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.240
No.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.440
No?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.280
No, you will not see me later.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.040
Life is long.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.560
We're done. Okay?

30:38.000 --> 30:41.720
I want you to listen to me, and I want you
to understand what I'm saying.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.760
We're through, right?

30:45.480 --> 30:47.080
We're through.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.880
Hello?

31:44.280 --> 31:45.800
Anyone home?

32:07.160 --> 32:10.920
- The treatment doesn't work.
- I didn't realize anyone was here.

32:11.840 --> 32:16.000
I want the research. Everything.
Whatever you and Anna have.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.000
Okay.
Can we talk about this calmly?

32:19.120 --> 32:21.320
- Please, fuck you.
- Beth?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.240
Yeah, look, the only thing I wanna
hear from you right now

32:23.360 --> 32:25.280
is where I can get the research.

32:25.400 --> 32:28.200
- I won't just give you Anna's work.
- Anna's work?

32:29.000 --> 32:31.760
Everything you did,
all of it was based on my work.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.440
Well, yeah, of course.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.400
You don't join a marathon
at the finish line and expect a medal.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.240
That's hardly
a useful metaphor, is it?

32:38.360 --> 32:41.400
Can we just sit down and discuss
this like two rational adults?

32:41.520 --> 32:43.200
Please, spare me this.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.120
This is not about the research.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.200
- What'd you mean?
- Nothing.

32:49.680 --> 32:53.000
- You think this is about you and Anna?
- Well, isn't it?

32:53.760 --> 32:55.680
God, you're so bloody arrogant.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.320
Lancaster's is my life's work.
I won't let someone take that from me.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.800
- I'm arrogant?
- Yeah.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.920
Do you have even an atom
of gratitude in you?

33:06.040 --> 33:07.280
Gratitude for what?

33:08.240 --> 33:10.680
- I saved your life.
- I never asked you to.

33:11.480 --> 33:15.160
- You went against my express wishes.
- I dismantled my own life.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.240
I broke it down to fucking pieces
to save yours.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.920
You did all that
just to service your own ego.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.840
No. No, don't answer the fucking door.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.800
- Sorry to disturb you at home.
- What is it?

33:35.120 --> 33:36.440
It's Anna.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.520
Come on! What's the holdup?

33:58.680 --> 34:01.120
- I have to be somewhere!
- Oh, fuck off.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.520
Come on, how much longer?

34:24.360 --> 34:28.360
What you want me to do?
Pull up bloody rocket boosters and fly?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.280
This is an emergency.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.920
This isn't an ambulance. I'm not sure
what it is you think I can do.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.320
We need to get to Anna!

34:35.440 --> 34:38.000
I'll repeat. I'm not sure
what it is you think I could be doing.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.200
Jesus. I'll be quicker walking.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.800
Get out and walk, then.

34:43.720 --> 34:46.800
I don't have time
for your inconsequential dramas.

34:47.560 --> 34:52.280
The world is on fire, Daniel.
Humanity is in existential peril.

34:52.920 --> 34:56.480
So I've got more important things to be
doing than rushing around after you

34:56.600 --> 34:59.760
every time you got some fucking mess
you need cleared up.

35:01.320 --> 35:02.640
Fine.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.400
Good!

35:21.520 --> 35:22.640
Who's this?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.560
Lee? It's me.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.120
I think
I fucked up a bit.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.280
Jamie, what did you do?

35:31.440 --> 35:35.240
The police came to visit me
and I told them Daniel was a doctor.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.040
I didn't mean to.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.160
I'm scared they're gonna track you down.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.920
No. Look, it's fine.
No one is ever gonna find the bunker.

35:43.320 --> 35:46.440
Don't worry about it, okay?
We're safe as houses.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.640
Kam, find out if Daniel Milton's
daughter is called Eve.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.000
I think I've done it.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.400
I'm gonna get my badge back.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.960
How are they?

36:16.080 --> 36:18.120
They've got temperatures,
like, crazy high.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.760
Their potassiums and calciums
are all over the place.

36:21.080 --> 36:24.080
- Abdominal seizures...
- When did they fall unconscious?

36:24.680 --> 36:26.760
I don't know.
I gave them a sedative.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.040
- You did what?
- I gave them a sedative.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.960
- Why?
- To... To sedate them.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.840
Why? What happened?

36:37.000 --> 36:39.160
I tweaked the dose
and then they got these side effects.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.400
Tweaked?

36:40.880 --> 36:44.160
- Are they gonna be okay?
- I'm gonna need your help.

36:44.320 --> 36:48.240
- What's happening?
- They're all in anaphylactic shock.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.480
- Now what?
- Pull his trousers down.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.000
Try and inject him in the thigh.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.080
Just jab it in.
Give me.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.760
If it wasn't for you...

38:06.000 --> 38:07.520
Police!

38:09.480 --> 38:10.960
Hands in the air.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.640
Neil?

38:16.040 --> 38:17.480
Neil?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.600
It's Rob, actually.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.400
Hi, Yvette.
Or should I say Anna?

38:23.000 --> 38:26.440
- What's going on?
- This isn't what it looks like.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.600
I'm not here by accident.
I'm a detective.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.720
- Well, I'm a doctor.
- Not now.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.640
Neil. Rob, I mean.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.240
I don't know what you think you know,
but you've got it all wrong.

38:36.360 --> 38:39.120
- We're not criminals.
- I'm sorry about this, Anna.

38:39.240 --> 38:40.720
I really enjoyed our date.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.160
Me too.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.000
What, you dated?

38:45.920 --> 38:49.000
- Well, does it matter?
- I didn't think you were seeing anyone.

38:49.680 --> 38:52.680
- I'm not seeing anyone...
- Enough! Hands in the air.

38:53.520 --> 38:54.880
Both of you.

38:56.480 --> 38:59.240
- We only went on one date.
- Whatever. I don't care.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.120
Oh, good.

39:02.440 --> 39:06.240
I only have one set of handcuffs,
so I'll need to cuff you together.

39:07.880 --> 39:10.040
Really? Do we need to do this?
Why don't you just let her go?

39:10.160 --> 39:11.640
Shut up and sit down.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.040
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.800
Back to back.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.560
This is just a massive
misunderstanding.

39:19.680 --> 39:20.800
Is it?

39:22.640 --> 39:24.840
Hands behind your backs.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.240
Anna.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.360
Get back.

39:45.480 --> 39:46.880
Anna.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.640
This is a bad idea.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.760
Maybe there's a way out of this.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.560
- Maybe there is.
- Great.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.400
We're friends.
Let's... have a friendly chat.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.480
Okay. I'm a scientist.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.000
I've been working on a cure
for Lancaster's.

40:03.160 --> 40:05.440
Okay. You don't need
to threaten me with scissors.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.600
And I've not just been working on it,
I've actually found a cure.

40:08.960 --> 40:12.600
Please put the scissors down, Anna.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.160
I'm the only one who knows about you.
Put the scissors down.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.320
Thank you. Fuck!

40:21.880 --> 40:26.720
You've made a big mistake!
I'm telling you, poor decision-making!

40:27.080 --> 40:32.600
What happens now? Fuck!
Guys, come on! Come on, let me out!

40:46.280 --> 40:47.400
Fuck!

40:47.520 --> 40:49.680
Your boyfriend sounds very cross.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.240
What are we gonna do?

40:55.640 --> 40:56.920
I don't know.

40:58.960 --> 41:02.040
- Well, have you got any ideas?
- I don't like this tone.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.240
No tone.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.160
I mean, who is he?

41:14.400 --> 41:16.840
It was just one time.
It was nothing serious.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.160
No, I'm not asking
because I'm jealous, Anna.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.120
I'm asking because he's a fucking
policeman and he's down here.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.400
But I didn't know
he was a policeman.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.200
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

42:19.080 --> 42:22.520
I'm gonna call Lee,
and we're gonna get him to bring his van.

42:23.120 --> 42:27.320
But he... he found us.
He's seen this place. He knows who I am.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.160
We're gonna sedate him.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.240
And we'll stick him in the van.
We'll drive him out to the countryside.

42:32.360 --> 42:35.680
And we come back here,
we clear everything out of the bunker

42:37.200 --> 42:39.360
and what we can't take, we'll burn.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.160
You can't be serious.

42:43.360 --> 42:44.720
It's the only way.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.760
What about me?
He knows about me.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.920
What's that?

43:29.640 --> 43:31.560
You really need to calm down.

43:35.800 --> 43:39.080
Look, you're not getting out of there.
It's bombproof.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.120
Oh, no.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
