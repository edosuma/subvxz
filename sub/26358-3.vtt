00:03.829 --> 00:04.830
Agent Callen.

00:04.874 --> 00:06.267
Brian Bush,
State Department.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.312
These men are with the
Diplomatic Security Service.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.097
Will you please send
your father out?

00:10.140 --> 00:11.141
What is this about?

00:11.185 --> 00:12.577
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

00:12.621 --> 00:14.405
But your father needs
to come with us right now.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.277
He's not going anywhere
till you answer my question.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.192
We have a warrant to enter
the premises and remove him.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.628
Please stand aside.

00:19.671 --> 00:20.933
No one is going any...

00:20.977 --> 00:22.109
Agent Callen!
NIKITA:
Grisha!

00:23.806 --> 00:25.329
I will go with them.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.157
CALLEN: In two days,
my father's gonna be traded

00:27.201 --> 00:29.159
to Russia via Iran
so that you can bring back

00:29.203 --> 00:30.682
a couple of freelance
photographers.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.294
I'm afraid this is gonna be
a very short conversation.

00:33.337 --> 00:36.253
From where I'm standing,
we've been more than fair.

00:36.297 --> 00:39.430
But if you persist,
that will change.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.954
And I have a feeling that
won't end well for you.

00:46.394 --> 00:49.005
Alex.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.138
I found them, Hetty.

00:51.181 --> 00:54.489
My father, my sister,
my family.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.493
Now I've lost them.

01:20.689 --> 01:22.647
Hot one today, huh?

01:22.691 --> 01:24.301
:
Well,

01:24.345 --> 01:26.260
look who I'm talking to.

01:26.303 --> 01:30.002
Probably feels like winter
compared to Saudi Arabia.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.015
BRIAN:
What the hell?

01:43.059 --> 01:45.061
Collins, get us out of here!

01:45.105 --> 01:46.584
Our escort is down.

01:46.628 --> 01:47.759
Requesting immediate backup.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.247
Don't worry.
We're safe in here.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.466
This vehicle's armored.

01:59.989 --> 02:02.034
Bomb! Stop the limo! Stop!

02:03.384 --> 02:04.776
Get out.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.839
♪

02:41.987 --> 02:44.164
Ugh, so we've been engaged
for a year and half.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.253
Who cares?That's what I said.
And then she said,

02:46.296 --> 02:48.124
"Well, an average couple
would be married by now,"

02:48.168 --> 02:50.170
to which I replied...We are not an average couple.

02:50.213 --> 02:53.999
Exactly. I mean, last week,
we basically fought a cyborg.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.958
This bothers you.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.526
I mean, it doesn't bother me
so much as it bothers her.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.180
Which bothers you.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.268
I mean, Kens, she's my mom.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.356
She's crazy as a loon,
but I love her.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.705
And she's terrified

03:03.748 --> 03:05.315
that we are gonna push
this wedding out so far

03:05.359 --> 03:06.838
that she's not gonna
be able to see it.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.232
Oh, my gosh, that's ridiculous.
She's not even that old.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.408
Oh, no, s-she means she's
literally not gonna be able

03:11.452 --> 03:13.845
to see it, 'cause our family
has a history of glaucoma.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.325
Okay.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.153
You know what? Just
please tell her this:

03:17.197 --> 03:18.328
we are gonna getting married,

03:18.372 --> 03:19.677
and we're gonna
get married soon.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.505
Oh, so you guys picked a date?

03:21.549 --> 03:23.290
Well, no.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.508
But we're going to.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.336
Soon.Soon.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.121
Yeah.Okay.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.166
KENSI:
No, we are. We are.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.168
Sure.No, we-- for real.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.388
We are.We're gonna, we're gonna,
we're gonna do it soon.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.911
KENSI: We are.DEEKS: Soon.

03:35.954 --> 03:38.522
Still going over
all those cases you missed?

03:38.566 --> 03:40.307
It's taking a little longer
than I thought.

03:40.350 --> 03:43.397
Agent DeChamps writes
very thorough reports.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.442
At least
she writes them.

03:45.486 --> 03:46.487
:
Oh, oh, oh.

03:46.530 --> 03:48.880
I write reports.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.882
No, you summarize
and you bullet point.

03:50.926 --> 03:53.363
Then I come in
and flesh them out.

03:53.407 --> 03:55.670
Yeah, that's our system.
Works very well.

03:55.713 --> 03:56.888
For you.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.238
Hmm.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.978
Hey, guys, we got a case.

04:00.022 --> 04:02.764
Is Admiral Kilbride
running this one?

04:02.807 --> 04:04.200
Uh, no. We're on our own.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.767
He flew back to D.C.
this morning.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.290
DEEKS: Does it
have something

04:07.334 --> 04:09.379
to do with Hetty and Mosley?

04:09.423 --> 04:11.990
No idea. We are completely
in the dark.

04:15.037 --> 04:17.474
I'm starting to have
a bad feeling about this.

04:23.132 --> 04:26.309
ERIC: Deputy Crown Prince Kamal
of Saudi Arabia landed

04:26.353 --> 04:28.529
at LAX this morning.
He's the minister of defense

04:28.572 --> 04:30.313
and third in line to the throne.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.750
But on his way
from the airport to his hotel,

04:32.794 --> 04:35.318
an attempt was
made on his life.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.320
CALLEN:
Attempt?

04:37.364 --> 04:39.017
It looks like the
assassin had a clear shot.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.410
Why'd he stop?NELL: Well,

04:40.454 --> 04:42.499
the camera is a little
too far away to show this,

04:42.543 --> 04:45.023
but that's actually
not Prince Kamal.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.416
It's a decoy.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.550
ERIC: The real prince was
safely in his hotel.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.334
He took a helicopter.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.988
So once the assassin
got close enough to see

04:53.031 --> 04:55.338
it was a decoy,
he aborted the hit.

04:55.382 --> 04:58.515
Any word on the condition of
the LAPD escort or the driver?

04:58.559 --> 05:01.039
They are fine. The assassin
only stunned them with a Taser.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.954
NELL: And if that's
not weird enough,

05:02.998 --> 05:05.217
he also placed a sticky bomb
on the window.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.219
I didn't see an explosion.

05:07.263 --> 05:09.570
That's because bomb disposal
says it was a fake.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.007
Just a block of clay with some
wires sticking out of it.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.835
SAM: Seems like its only
purpose was to get the target

05:13.878 --> 05:15.271
to expose himself.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.707
No collateral damage.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.405
That's, uh,
surprisingly bizarre.

05:18.448 --> 05:19.971
How can we help?

05:20.015 --> 05:21.930
Well, Diplomatic Security
Service will be protecting him

05:21.973 --> 05:24.715
while he's in town, but SECNAV
and the defense secretary

05:24.759 --> 05:26.500
want to be extra careful.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.936
Saudi Arabia is one of

05:27.979 --> 05:29.372
our most important allies
in the Middle East.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.243
ERIC:
Now, the FBI

05:31.287 --> 05:32.897
will be taking over the
investigation, but they've

05:32.941 --> 05:34.029
asked us to help where we can,

05:34.072 --> 05:35.335
especially when it comes
to the safety

05:35.378 --> 05:36.858
of the prince while in-country.NELL: Mm-hmm.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.250
If anything happens to him...

05:38.294 --> 05:39.687
It would be a major
international incident.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.166
Who's the DSS agent in charge?

05:41.210 --> 05:43.691
Uh, that would be...

05:43.734 --> 05:46.215
Brian Bush.

05:50.915 --> 05:54.397
Any leads on the bike?

05:54.441 --> 05:55.877
ERIC:
Uh...

05:55.920 --> 05:57.792
Mm-mm....lost it in traffic cams,
but we're looking.

05:59.315 --> 06:00.490
Kensi and Deeks,
why don't you check out

06:00.534 --> 06:02.579
the scene
of the crime.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.451
Sam and I will go over
and coordinate

06:04.494 --> 06:06.366
with DSS at the hotel.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.497
You sure?

06:07.541 --> 06:09.891
Yep.

06:12.937 --> 06:16.463
Good luck.See you.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.251
Thank you, Lynae.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.905
So the great news
is the FBI said

06:23.948 --> 06:26.081
we could process the scene
for evidence.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.952
We just got to "run it by them."

06:27.996 --> 06:29.606
KENSI:
Copy that.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.956
Hey, so you think we're really
gonna meet this crown prince?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.481
Well, it's deputy
crown prince, actually.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.483
And if we do, I have
a few choice words for him

06:36.526 --> 06:37.701
about his country's
treatment of women.

06:37.745 --> 06:38.920
What are you talking about?

06:38.963 --> 06:40.356
They're letting you guys
drive over there now

06:40.400 --> 06:41.488
and calling it progress.

06:41.531 --> 06:42.837
Yeah.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.709
Progress is fine,
but equality would be great.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.711
Amen to that. Up top.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.713
That's okay,
we'll get that later.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.933
So are we looking
for something in particular?

06:51.976 --> 06:54.022
DSS changed the route
at the last minute,

06:54.065 --> 06:55.589
so I was wondering...

06:55.632 --> 06:57.591
How the assassin knew
where to find him?

07:00.594 --> 07:02.726
Eureka.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.162
Ooh.GPS tracker.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.425
DEEKS:
Oh, wow.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.427
You know what we should do
with that?

07:07.470 --> 07:09.167
Run it by the FBI.Run it by the FBI.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.735
I got my glove on,
I can help now.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.607
Hey.I'm ready.

07:15.739 --> 07:18.220
♪ Don't tell me it's over...

07:18.263 --> 07:21.615
All right, I already see
a big problem.

07:21.658 --> 07:26.010
We got multiple points of entry,
no agents at any of them.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.491
DSS is gonna have to
rethink this whole setup.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.710
Yeah, well,

07:29.753 --> 07:31.581
there's the guy to talk to.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.541
♪

07:34.584 --> 07:36.586
You gonna be okay
working with him?

07:38.545 --> 07:40.503
He was just doing his job.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.766
We'll find your father, G.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.507
Hell, for all we
know, he escaped

07:44.551 --> 07:47.249
and he's hanging out on
a nude beach in the Black Sea.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.817
Is that supposed to make me
feel better?

07:49.860 --> 07:52.428
BRIAN: Have them
there, just in case.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.345
Agent Hanna. Agent Callen.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.652
I appreciate you guys
coming so quickly.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.262
We can use all
the help we can get.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.786
What security measures
do you have in place?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.701
BRIAN: The prince
and his entourage

08:04.745 --> 08:06.703
have taken over
the top floor of the hotel.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.705
The elevators are programmed

08:08.749 --> 08:11.708
only to let those
with key card access up.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.536
The stairwell doors
are locked

08:13.580 --> 08:15.364
with agents
posted at each one.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.105
We only have ten agents,
including me.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.541
That's not enough.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.195
Does the prince
have his own security?

08:20.238 --> 08:22.719
He has four men stationed
at the penthouse at all times.

08:22.763 --> 08:25.548
And what exactly is the
purpose of this visit?

08:25.592 --> 08:27.071
Business meetings.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.769
This year, Saudi Arabia

08:28.812 --> 08:30.553
has finally opened
the doors to Hollywood.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.120
We have all
the biggest producers

08:32.163 --> 08:35.036
coming in
to kiss the ring.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.994
We're talking
billion dollar deals.

08:42.434 --> 08:43.871
WOMAN: Ow, ow, ow,
watch the dress.

08:43.914 --> 08:46.047
MAN: We're sorry.Don't push me!

08:46.090 --> 08:47.875
He's pushing me, Harry.We just wanted a photo

08:47.918 --> 08:49.659
with the prince, you know,
to bless our union...

08:49.703 --> 08:52.532
We've had a few breaches, okay?
Mostly from idiots like that.

08:52.575 --> 08:56.013
But no one's made it
even close to the penthouse.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.450
You guys need to think
about moving the prince

08:58.494 --> 08:59.800
to an undisclosed location.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.236
Well, I already proposed that.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.020
He refused, said it would
disrupt his schedule.

09:03.064 --> 09:04.239
What about

09:04.282 --> 09:05.675
shutting the hotel down
to the other guests?

09:05.719 --> 09:07.372
BRIAN: Prince doesn't
want the bad press.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.374
It's starting to sound like the
prince is calling the shots.

09:09.418 --> 09:13.161
Agent Hanna, when you're
a major oil producer

09:13.204 --> 09:17.034
and a-a multi-billion dollar
client of the arms industry,

09:17.078 --> 09:19.254
people tend to let you do
what you want.

09:19.297 --> 09:22.649
Hmm.
Problem is,
it may get him killed.

09:27.479 --> 09:28.655
Your Royal Highness.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.485
This is Special Agent Callen.Pleasure.

09:33.529 --> 09:34.661
BRIAN:
Special Agent Hanna.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.532
Assalamu alaikum.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.794
Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.013
What can I do
for you, gentlemen?

09:39.056 --> 09:41.363
Actually, it's what
they can do for you.

09:41.406 --> 09:42.712
They're here to supplement
your protection detail.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.715
Agent Bush,
we talked about this.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.021
It is not necessary.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.240
SAM: With all due respect,
Your Royal Highness,

09:49.284 --> 09:51.242
this assassin
is motivated, organized.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.461
We can't take this lightly.

09:52.504 --> 09:55.029
You have a military bearing,
Agent Hanna.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.465
What branch did you serve in?

09:56.508 --> 09:59.294
Navy, SEALs.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.687
Ah.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.385
The warriors
who took down bin Laden.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.430
He's from my country,
you know.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.824
That is a past we are
trying to put behind us.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.653
You need to be alive to do that.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.703
Ah, okay, very well. I accept.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.705
But I prefer
for my security

10:18.748 --> 10:21.925
to blend in as to not
intimidate my guests.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.797
My tailor, Rashid,
he will outfit you

10:23.840 --> 10:25.146
in something
a bit more formal.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.714
Uh, f-forgive me,
Your Royal Highness,

10:27.757 --> 10:29.063
you don't seem very worried.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.848
Agent Callen,
I am very accustomed

10:31.892 --> 10:33.371
to receiving death threats.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.895
My brother was assassinated.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.071
Thank you. Thank you.My grandfather
was assassinated.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.638
Thank you.I will not let this

10:38.681 --> 10:41.336
interfere with my life
or my country's future.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.338
When my time comes,

10:43.381 --> 10:44.687
I will be ready.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.602
But inshallah,

10:46.646 --> 10:49.518
my time will not come today.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.085
Excuse me.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.004
No pressure.

11:09.016 --> 11:12.019
The ayatollah,
the Houthis, Canada.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.108
Wow, turns out
being a crown prince

11:14.151 --> 11:15.631
makes for a whole
lot of enemies.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.677
Yeah, especially when
you're trying to disrupt

11:17.720 --> 11:19.896
decades of policy.Hmm.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.289
DEEKS:
Special delivery

11:21.332 --> 11:22.507
for Mr. Beale.

11:22.551 --> 11:23.813
I got the
GPS tracker

11:23.857 --> 11:25.946
from the limo.Sweet.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.164
Prints have already
been processed.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.383
I love hacking
these things.

11:28.426 --> 11:29.993
It combines my passion for maps

11:30.037 --> 11:31.908
with my hidden
voyeuristic fantasies.Hmm.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.695
It's not so
hidden now.

11:37.218 --> 11:40.221
They're just fantasies.
Everyone has fantasies.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.310
Stop saying fantasies.
You're freaking me out.

11:42.353 --> 11:45.705
Do you really want to
move in with this guy?
Eh.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.532
I'm gonna go, okay? Just go.

11:47.576 --> 11:48.490
Sorry. I love you.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.535
Love you, too.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.450
Anything new
on the assassin?

11:52.494 --> 11:54.670
Well, no luck tracking the
motorcycle, but in the meantime,

11:54.714 --> 11:56.498
I've been working up
some threat assessments.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.674
Oh, okay, do you need
some help with that?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.763
Oh, I do appreciate
the offer; however,

12:00.807 --> 12:02.809
if GPS trackers are
Beale's weird fetish,

12:02.852 --> 12:06.421
then prioritizing
death threats is mine.

12:06.464 --> 12:10.381
Yikes. Which is why you're
perfect for each other.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.079
In that case, we
have some downtime.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.384
Should we make some,
uh, wedding plans?

12:13.428 --> 12:14.559
Yeah.Ooh!

12:14.603 --> 12:15.996
You guys are doing that again?

12:16.039 --> 12:18.259
Uh...

12:18.302 --> 12:19.564
KENSI: I don't know
what you're saying,

12:19.608 --> 12:21.566
we never stopped.
Oh!

12:21.610 --> 12:22.785
Sorry, I just...

12:22.829 --> 12:25.005
I-I knew you
were making, like...
Yeah.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.703
...lots of plans last year,
and then nothing really...

12:27.747 --> 12:29.836
happened.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.533
So I thought it was postponed.

12:31.576 --> 12:34.623
Nope, nope, didn't get
postponed. Not postponed.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.407
Not gonna be postponed.
It's going through with it.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.105
We are going through with it.
It's gonna happen,

12:38.148 --> 12:39.889
and we're gonna pick
a date right now.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.717
Okay, we'll do that.Kensi! No!

12:41.761 --> 12:43.371
I'm sorry.She's fine, she's fine.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.112
You know I didn't mean it
like that, though, right?I know.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.070
I know. It's fine.Because I want you
to get married.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.290
And I'm happy
you're getting married.I want to get married.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.466
And...

12:51.509 --> 12:55.339
I just hope it happens
sometime this century.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.957
That Rashid is a
miracle worker.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.263
Are you worried
about looking too good?

13:06.307 --> 13:08.352
Not really.I didn't think so.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.527
What's going on in there?

13:09.571 --> 13:12.095
SAM: The prince
is having a busy week.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.923
Every power player in town
wants to meet with him.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.838
You'd think that
an assassination attempt

13:15.882 --> 13:17.492
would make people
think twice.

13:17.535 --> 13:20.974
Not when you have to finance
the remake of Apocalypse Now.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.107
You're joking.

13:24.151 --> 13:27.415
This one takes place in space.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.983
It's gonna be a long week.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.854
Let's hope Kensi and
Deeks find a lead.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.856
Yeah.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.466
KENSI:
Eric.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.207
What have you found?

13:37.251 --> 13:38.730
So, as you can see,

13:38.774 --> 13:40.558
the only data points
on the tracker

13:40.602 --> 13:42.647
were the route the
limo took from LAX

13:42.691 --> 13:44.649
to the location where
it got attacked.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.086
That's not really helpful.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.828
Mm, but there was another
data point hidden

13:48.871 --> 13:50.786
in the tracker's deleted history
from last night,

13:50.830 --> 13:52.570
as if someone, like,
turned it on to test it

13:52.614 --> 13:54.529
and then wiped the data,
only-- spoiler alert--

13:54.572 --> 13:56.052
nothing's ever really gone.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.314
So where was it?

13:57.358 --> 13:59.055
ERIC:
Here.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.666
A motel in Hollywood.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.320
I can pinpoint it
to within three feet.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.105
Perfect. We're
on our way.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.368
ERIC: Sending the
address to your phones.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.600
Ready? On three.

14:22.644 --> 14:25.429
One, two, three.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.826
Kens? Clear.Clear.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.568
Beale, we need an
ambulance at the motel.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.875
Oh, hey. It's okay.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.833
Oh.We're federal agents.
We're here to help.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.748
Is

14:40.705 --> 14:42.011
Is who gone?

14:42.055 --> 14:44.840
The woman that called me here
and tied me up.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.147
Wait, why-why
am I still...?

14:47.190 --> 14:49.279
It's okay. We have to
verify your identity first.

14:49.323 --> 14:50.933
What's your name?

14:50.977 --> 14:53.544
Sarah. Sarah Lombard.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.155
Beale, I just sent you a pic.
You getting this?

14:55.198 --> 14:57.679
ERIC:
Running it now.

14:57.722 --> 15:00.203
Verified. That is Sarah Lombard.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.465
No police record.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.032
Okay. I apologize for this.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.468
It's just the woman we're
looking for is very dangerous.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.122
Yeah, you got that right.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.168
She drugged me and left me here.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.039
Do you know what she gave you?

15:10.083 --> 15:11.171
No.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.389
It's okay. You want to stand?

15:12.433 --> 15:13.521
Yeah.Nice and easy.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.653
I got you. I got
you. You all right?

15:15.697 --> 15:17.742
SARAH: Yeah.What do you do for a living?

15:17.786 --> 15:19.788
I'm a massage therapist.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.572
That's why I'm here.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.748
I-I got a call
about an in-room massage.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.576
I should've turned around
when I saw the place,

15:25.620 --> 15:27.839
but I need the money.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.450
Do you have your own table?

15:29.493 --> 15:32.627
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
It's, um...

15:32.670 --> 15:35.108
Wait.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.414
Did that bitch
take my table?

15:37.458 --> 15:38.763
Okay, Sarah, focus for a second.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.852
Do you have any more
appointments today?

15:43.246 --> 15:44.639
SARAH:
Just one.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.686
Sarah Lombard. Where is she?

15:48.730 --> 15:51.646
The masseuse?
I just sent her to 1418.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.518
Oh, that was quick.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.477
Lock the prince down now!Go! Go!

15:56.520 --> 15:58.218
Federal agents!

15:58.261 --> 15:59.959
Move out of the way!

16:12.754 --> 16:15.148
Need agents in the lobby
and the loading dock.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.250
G, I don't have her.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.338
CALLEN:
Copy.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.820
Got her.
Headed to the loading dock.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.174
Keep that door open!

16:44.612 --> 16:45.700
Joelle, stop!

16:45.743 --> 16:48.355
Federal agent. Open the door.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.072
Where are you going?

17:10.116 --> 17:11.291
There was just an attempt
on the prince's life.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.857
This isn't what you
think it is, Bush.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.381
You can't build up a wall
and think that will deter her.

17:14.424 --> 17:15.773
She will just keep coming.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.514
How do you even know this?

17:17.558 --> 17:19.734
Tell the prince to
cancel all his meetings

17:19.777 --> 17:21.562
for the day.I told you, he won't do it.

17:21.605 --> 17:22.693
Convince him.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.739
His life depends on it.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.567
We will keep you posted.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.090
Will you? 'Cause it sure sounds

17:28.134 --> 17:29.483
like you're not telling me
something.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.311
Look, Agent Callen,

17:31.354 --> 17:32.921
I know we've had our differences
in the past...

17:32.964 --> 17:35.489
This is not personal.
I'm asking you to trust me.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.366
I'll talk to the prince.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.371
Not personal, huh?

17:48.415 --> 17:50.417
Least not with him.

17:55.857 --> 17:59.034
So, FBI said paramedics
are checking on Sarah,

17:59.078 --> 18:00.818
but they suspect
it was just a sedative.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.733
Did you talk
to the motel manager?Yes.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.996
No security footage, and no I.D.
on the woman that checked in,

18:05.040 --> 18:07.086
which is probably why
she chose this place.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.783
Oh.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.480
Bingo.What'd you find?

18:10.524 --> 18:12.613
USB drive? Okay.

18:12.656 --> 18:13.962
Make a forensic image?

18:14.005 --> 18:15.877
Coming right up.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.965
Hey, we're gonna need
this uploaded right now.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.880
Thanks.Right.

18:18.923 --> 18:21.752
Come on. Big winner.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.754
No whammies.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.626
Yeah.Got it.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.410
Hey, Eric, we found a
thumb drive at the motel.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.282
Gonna send it to you now.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.849
Got it. All right,
no detectable malware.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.982
I will start sorting through it.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.679
How about the boys at the
hotel

18:35.723 --> 18:37.028
NELL: Just got off the phone
with Callen.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.944
He wants you two back at
the boatshed right now.

18:39.988 --> 18:42.469
Did he give you any more
information than that?

18:42.512 --> 18:44.906
Mm, he said he'll explain
when you get there.

18:46.342 --> 18:47.778
All right, on our way.

18:54.045 --> 18:57.136
So, Callen I.D.'d the assassin.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.963
That's great.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.835
That's not great.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.619
Who is it?

19:02.663 --> 19:03.925
Joelle.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.928
Okay, I'm confused,

19:06.971 --> 19:08.973
because I only know
one person named Joelle,

19:09.017 --> 19:09.974
and that person is dead.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.151
Mm...

19:12.194 --> 19:14.109
Isn't she?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.111
Callen and Sam
helped fake her death

19:16.155 --> 19:17.765
for the safety of her family.

19:17.808 --> 19:20.202
Are you kidding me?
Wait, why didn't they tell us?

19:20.246 --> 19:21.943
We can keep secrets.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.423
We could have helped them.

19:23.466 --> 19:26.339
Mm, one of us kind of did.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.211
You knew?

19:29.255 --> 19:32.040
I'm sorry.You knew,
and you didn't tell me?

19:32.083 --> 19:34.608
I was going to tell you,
but things got kind of crazy

19:34.651 --> 19:37.001
around here, you know,
with Hetty and Vietnam

19:37.045 --> 19:39.134
and then Mosley
and Mexico and I just...Nell.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.963
Nell, how long does it take
to say, "By the way,

19:42.006 --> 19:43.007
"Joelle's still alive.
We faked her death

19:43.051 --> 19:44.400
"to protect her family.

19:44.444 --> 19:45.575
Can you pass the potatoes?"Honey, oh.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.621
I...

19:52.060 --> 19:53.148
I'm sorry.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.497
I forgive you.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.847
Should we get cracking on this?

19:56.891 --> 19:59.241
Let's do it. Okay.

19:59.285 --> 20:03.071
Mm-hmm.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.815
You didn't have
to keep this from us.

20:07.858 --> 20:11.035
It was safer this way,
for Joelle's family...

20:11.079 --> 20:12.080
We wouldn't have
told anybody, Callen.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.690
...and for you.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.823
The fewer people that knew,
the better. This organization,

20:15.866 --> 20:17.825
this syndicate that
she was going after,

20:17.868 --> 20:19.566
they're responsible
for the rogue CIA group

20:19.609 --> 20:21.045
that's been trying
to take us down.

20:21.089 --> 20:23.396
The attack on Granger's life.Even your kidnapping.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.963
Look, there was no reason
to risk your lives, too,

20:26.007 --> 20:27.443
not again.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.576
Well, if you haven't noticed,
that's kind of our job.

20:29.619 --> 20:33.406
Well, for what it's
worth, I'm sorry.

20:33.449 --> 20:34.407
DEEKS:
It's all good.

20:34.450 --> 20:35.538
Can't really
blame you, anyway.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.671
You were raised like this,

20:37.714 --> 20:39.977
thanks to the Hetty Lange
School of Mischief.

20:40.021 --> 20:43.372
KENSI: Okay.
So what's the plan now?

20:43.416 --> 20:45.766
Joelle is after
the deputy crown prince.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.637
Have we had any luck
tracking her?

20:47.681 --> 20:49.857
Nell was not able to get
anything from the cameras

20:49.900 --> 20:51.293
in the surrounding area.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.121
We need to understand
why she's doing this.

20:53.164 --> 20:55.602
Try to anticipate
her next move.

20:55.645 --> 20:56.951
Nell said she's going
after the syndicate.

20:56.994 --> 20:58.431
We have to at least
entertain the possibility

20:58.474 --> 21:00.433
that Prince Kamal
is involved.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.435
Or at the least,
she believes he is.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.958
And what the hell is this
syndicate, anyway?

21:04.001 --> 21:05.307
It sounds like a Bond villain.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.440
More like Mission:
Impossible.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.050
The fifth one,
to be exact.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.443
Although this particular group

21:10.486 --> 21:12.358
does not call themselves
the Syndicate.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.011
What'd you find?

21:14.055 --> 21:15.578
Okay, so we've been going
through the thumb drive

21:15.622 --> 21:16.971
recovered
from the motel room.

21:17.014 --> 21:19.930
What Joelle has put together
on there is damning.

21:19.974 --> 21:21.889
It details the activities
of a company

21:21.932 --> 21:25.632
called Gulf States
Geologic Survey, or 2GS.

21:25.675 --> 21:27.982
ERIC: In public, they claim
to specialize in mining

21:28.025 --> 21:30.506
and oil exploration, but,
according to these documents,

21:30.550 --> 21:33.509
what 2GS really is is a
bunch of shady businessmen,

21:33.553 --> 21:35.859
government officials,
and former CIA officers.

21:35.903 --> 21:36.947
NELL:
Joelle has amassed financial

21:36.991 --> 21:38.949
and operational records

21:38.993 --> 21:41.691
of the company's use
of paramilitary tactics

21:41.735 --> 21:45.086
to exploit and profit
from war-torn countries.

21:45.129 --> 21:46.696
These are places that
legitimate businesses

21:46.740 --> 21:48.002
are not allowed
to operate.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.265
Well, they at least have
a guy with metal teeth

21:50.309 --> 21:51.919
and a razor

21:53.094 --> 21:55.096
What's the deputy crown prince's
involvement?

21:55.139 --> 21:57.054
NELL:
He doesn't seem to have any.

21:57.098 --> 22:00.057
In fact, everything seems
to indicate that 2GS would see

22:00.101 --> 22:02.016
his modernizing policies
as an obstacle

22:02.059 --> 22:03.887
to their operation.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.368
Guys, the east motion sensor

22:06.412 --> 22:09.589
was just tripped.
You've got company.

22:09.632 --> 22:10.981
JOELLE:
Callen?

22:11.025 --> 22:13.070
It's me.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.682
Slowly, Joelle.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.384
DEEKS:
Wow. Nice helmet.

22:22.428 --> 22:25.126
We really need
a new secret hideout.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.395
I know how this looks,

22:33.439 --> 22:35.963
but I'm not here
to kill the prince.

22:36.006 --> 22:38.269
I'm here to save him.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.638
Fate keeps throwing us
back together, doesn't it?

22:58.681 --> 23:00.074
Fate?

23:00.117 --> 23:02.032
You walked through our door.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.686
I didn't have another choice.

23:03.730 --> 23:04.992
You raided my motel room.

23:05.035 --> 23:07.647
For all I know,
every agency's looking for me.

23:07.690 --> 23:11.041
If someone's gonna arrest me,
I'd rather it be you.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.174
: Oh. You thought
I'd go easy on you, huh?

23:13.217 --> 23:16.351
I-I didn't mean to involve you
in this, Callen.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.658
I really didn't. I didn't know
you'd be at the hotel.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.834
I'm glad I was. Otherwise
the prince might be dead.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.879
I was there to protect him.

23:22.923 --> 23:25.055
That's not what this
looks like, Joelle.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.492
And that was the point.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.015
I went after the prince's decoy
on purpose, Callen.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.452
Do you really think
I'd make a mistake like that?

23:30.496 --> 23:33.020
2GS wants the crown prince dead.

23:33.063 --> 23:34.195
Eric and Nell confirmed it.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.849
Those documents are authentic.

23:35.892 --> 23:38.025
They are being verified.
Where did you get them?

23:38.068 --> 23:40.157
I have a source
inside the company.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.768
He told me
the assassination

23:41.811 --> 23:43.465
would take place during
the prince's visit to L.A.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.075
Can we talk to the source?

23:45.119 --> 23:47.643
No. He stopped responding.

23:47.687 --> 23:50.037
Mm.He's either
in hiding or...

23:50.080 --> 23:52.779
Look, my intention
with the decoy

23:52.822 --> 23:55.085
was to scare the prince enough
that he'd cancel his trip.

23:55.129 --> 23:58.001
Just turn around, go back
to Saudi Arabia where he's safe.

23:58.045 --> 24:01.788
Apparently, he's more stubborn
than I thought.

24:01.831 --> 24:04.399
What about the hotel?

24:04.443 --> 24:05.966
What was your intention there?

24:06.009 --> 24:09.665
Well, 2GS uses former CIA
officers to do their dirty work.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.450
You mean people like yourself.

24:12.581 --> 24:15.105
I snuck in to see
if I could I.D. someone.

24:15.149 --> 24:19.196
I disguised myself
so they wouldn't I.D. me.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.112
Well, you will be happy to know
that your plan worked.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.027
After he found out

24:24.071 --> 24:26.769
that you had strapped one
of his aides to a massage table,

24:26.813 --> 24:28.423
the prince decided
to cancel the rest

24:28.467 --> 24:29.990
of his trip.
He's leaving

24:30.033 --> 24:30.991
in one hour.No, it's too late.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.906
Moving him now will just put him

24:32.949 --> 24:34.429
at greater risk.I agree.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.518
Which is why we don't have
a lot of time

24:36.562 --> 24:39.129
to stop this assassination.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.566
Wait. Wait, what?

24:40.609 --> 24:43.003
You...

24:43.046 --> 24:45.527
you believe me?

24:45.571 --> 24:47.355
No...

24:47.398 --> 24:50.140
no big fight?
No raised voices?

24:50.184 --> 24:51.925
Is that what you want?

24:53.883 --> 24:56.103
Then let's go.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.855
Brian Bush just called.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.857
He wants an update.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.293
Then let's
give him one.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.034
Go back to the hotel
with Kensi and Deeks.

25:15.165 --> 25:16.993
Tell Bush everything.

25:17.037 --> 25:19.039
You trust him?

25:19.082 --> 25:22.129
I think that if we want to keep
the prince safe, we have to.

25:22.172 --> 25:23.130
KENSI:
Okay.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.001
What are you gonna do?

25:32.226 --> 25:33.444
No.

25:33.488 --> 25:34.881
No.

25:34.924 --> 25:36.186
No, no, no.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.231
No. No, no,
no, no, no.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.667
Eric...No.

25:38.711 --> 25:39.668
Wait.I have a weapon.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.017
Stand back.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.154
What's going
on here?

25:47.197 --> 25:49.112
Joelle's here.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.071
I know. I brought her here.

25:51.114 --> 25:52.725
Callen,
are you insane?

25:52.768 --> 25:54.553
She'll-she'll
see everything.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.032
She'll see the big board!

25:56.076 --> 25:57.643
CALLEN: She's already
seen everything.

25:57.686 --> 25:59.166
You remember her colleague,
Carl Brown, worked here

25:59.209 --> 26:00.254
for a couple years?
None of this

26:00.297 --> 26:02.212
is new to her.
Besides, we need her

26:02.256 --> 26:03.649
to help I.D. the assassin.
It could be a member

26:03.692 --> 26:04.693
of the prince's entourage.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.739
It could be one
of the DSS agents.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.828
I need you
to run all of them by her.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.003
Hold on. Wait. Us?

26:10.046 --> 26:11.178
Wait, where are you going?

26:11.221 --> 26:12.875
I'm going back to the hotel.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.442
Well, take me with you.
I can do more from there.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.965
Not up for discussion.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.271
I.D. the assassin.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.752
We will take care of the rest.

26:19.795 --> 26:21.449
:
Wow.

26:22.493 --> 26:25.061
Sorry I scared you.

26:25.105 --> 26:27.237
You didn't scare me, okay?

26:31.546 --> 26:33.243
: Should we at least,
like, tie her up or something?

26:33.287 --> 26:35.506
I don't know. That
might be excessive.

26:37.465 --> 26:38.640
Eric.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.165
I don't even know
where to begin.

26:42.209 --> 26:45.299
Not only do you believe
this woman's insane story,

26:45.342 --> 26:48.128
but you're actively using her
to protect the very prince

26:48.171 --> 26:49.477
that she tried to kill today?

26:49.520 --> 26:51.958
Yeah, technically, she
didn't try to kill him.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.046
Technically, she didn't try

26:53.089 --> 26:55.222
to kill anybody.
That we know of.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.790
SAM: Agent Bush,
look, we didn't have

26:57.833 --> 26:58.878
to tell you about any of this.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.488
You asked us
to keep you informed.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.185
In less than a half
an hour, the prince

27:02.229 --> 27:03.360
is gonna come out
of this hotel.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.798
You can either accept
our help or not.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.540
The prince likes you.

27:09.584 --> 27:11.804
I'll stay with him
the whole time.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.632
What's your plan
for moving him?

27:13.675 --> 27:15.024
It's the same as this morning.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.547
We chopper back
to LAX.

27:16.591 --> 27:17.984
The decoy leaves
through ground transportation.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.072
Switch it up.

27:19.115 --> 27:20.377
Let the decoy take
the helicopter.

27:20.421 --> 27:23.163
Are you running this,
Agent Hanna, or am I?

27:23.206 --> 27:25.556
We don't even know
what to expect.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.123
Once that helicopter's
in the air,

27:27.167 --> 27:28.647
we can't protect it.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.692
We can protect the prince
on the ground.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.695
Fine.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.958
I'll go with the decoy
in the chopper.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.527
I don't like heights, okay?

27:40.833 --> 27:43.313
We all make sacrifices
for the job.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.575
KENSI:
Speaking of heights,

27:44.619 --> 27:46.229
I'm gonna go
get set up.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.971
I'll go coordinate
with LAPD escorts.

27:49.015 --> 27:52.540
Hey. Look, Bush,

27:52.583 --> 27:55.238
we're gonna get the prince
through this.

27:55.282 --> 27:57.240
Yeah?

27:57.284 --> 27:59.068
What about us?

27:59.112 --> 28:02.289
'Cause if the secretary gets
wind of how this played out,

28:02.332 --> 28:05.074
we can kiss our careers
good-bye.

28:08.774 --> 28:12.299
NELL: Last up,
Agent Sean Collins.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.170
No, not him either.

28:14.214 --> 28:15.563
Well, that was
the last one.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.304
So now we're
out of suspects.

28:17.347 --> 28:19.915
Hey, I've been going
through more 2GS documents.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.222
In the last decade, they've been
responsible for half a dozen

28:22.265 --> 28:24.267
assassinations.And if you don't
let me go help,

28:24.311 --> 28:25.921
you can add another one
to that list.

28:25.965 --> 28:27.140
Okay, we've been
over this before.

28:27.183 --> 28:29.055
Callen said stay,
so you stay.

28:29.098 --> 28:30.491
Well, then get him
on the phone.

28:30.534 --> 28:31.666
Hey, hey,

28:31.710 --> 28:32.972
don't talk to
her like that.

28:33.015 --> 28:34.538
Okay, listen,
I like you two.

28:34.582 --> 28:35.888
Okay? But
if I really wanted

28:35.931 --> 28:37.541
to leave here, you
wouldn't be able to stop me.

28:47.551 --> 28:49.205
Okay, let's...

28:49.249 --> 28:51.512
let's try this again.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.862
Please,

28:53.906 --> 28:57.605
will you get Callen
on the phone?

28:58.649 --> 29:00.390
Please?

29:09.356 --> 29:12.576
Callen,
do you copy?

29:18.017 --> 29:19.366
Thanks, Nell.Yep.

29:19.409 --> 29:22.238
Still think this
is a bad idea.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.374
Hey, Joelle,

29:27.417 --> 29:29.768
I'll be watching you from Ops.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.598
She's, um...

29:34.642 --> 29:36.426
scarier than I remember.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.515
That's why we call her
the Nellverine.

29:38.559 --> 29:40.822
How much time do we have?

29:40.866 --> 29:42.868
Prince's ETA is ten minutes.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.478
Will I be on comms?

29:44.521 --> 29:46.610
Won't need to be. You'll be
right by my side the whole time.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.395
What about a gun?

29:48.438 --> 29:51.833
Last time I gave you
one of those, I regretted it.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.922
Well, then,
what am I doing here, Callen?

29:53.966 --> 29:56.925
You're still the only one
that can I.D. the assassin.

29:56.969 --> 29:58.318
That is all we need you for.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.495
What happens to me after that?

30:03.453 --> 30:05.325
Just keep your eyes open.

30:07.544 --> 30:09.851
Okay.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.853
It's time. I'm gonna
head up to the prince.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.072
Do you trust her?

30:13.115 --> 30:14.769
SAM:
I trust Callen.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.162
Yeah, but what if

30:16.205 --> 30:17.380
she's playing us again,
you know?

30:17.424 --> 30:19.121
Like, what if she just
turned herself in

30:19.165 --> 30:20.862
so she could have another shot
at the prince?

30:23.996 --> 30:26.476
Then we take her out
before she gets that shot.

30:58.073 --> 31:00.641
Forgive me, Your Royal
Highness, but it's time to go.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.645
It's far too short a visit.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.908
I love your city,
Agent Hanna.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.955
It's so, um... green.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.654
It's all relative, I guess.

31:13.697 --> 31:16.309
If I have to die here,
I would not be disappointed.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.528
Although I'd prefer to die
in my home country.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.966
We'll get you home.

31:21.009 --> 31:23.882
I know only God can make
such a promise,

31:23.925 --> 31:26.014
but, uh, somehow,
I believe you.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.018
What of you, Agent Hanna?

31:30.062 --> 31:31.933
Where would you prefer to die?

31:36.459 --> 31:38.461
The sea.

31:41.682 --> 31:44.859
I've always felt
most at peace there,

31:44.903 --> 31:47.035
even during wartime.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.736
I suppose it is a shame then,

31:52.780 --> 31:55.261
we cannot take a boat
to the airport.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.449
Moving to the elevator.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.494
Moving to the roof.

32:22.157 --> 32:24.246
All right, LAPD's in position.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.987
I'll be following in the Audi.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.597
Fire it up, boys.

32:27.641 --> 32:29.121
Just be careful, sweetheart.

32:29.164 --> 32:30.426
Once you leave
that loading dock,

32:30.470 --> 32:31.688
I'm no longer covering your ass.

32:31.732 --> 32:32.994
No, no, no. Don't worry.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.996
My ass is gonna get home
safe and sound,

32:35.040 --> 32:36.780
'cause we still have a wedding
to plan.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.130
CALLEN:
Ah, so you two

32:38.173 --> 32:39.740
actually are
getting married, huh?

32:39.783 --> 32:40.959
I mean, theoretically, yeah.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.612
KENSI:
Okay, you know what?

32:42.656 --> 32:44.614
Callen, one more comment like
that, I'm gonna start shooting.

32:46.181 --> 32:47.748
Yikes.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.489
Hey, guys,
let's clear the airways

32:49.532 --> 32:51.534
and keep our eyes open, huh?

32:52.579 --> 32:54.276
Copy that.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.061
Anything?

32:56.104 --> 32:57.801
No. I don't know.

32:57.845 --> 33:00.065
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it won't be

33:00.108 --> 33:02.241
someone I recognize, or maybe
they recognized me already,

33:02.284 --> 33:03.938
and they aborted the hit.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.462
Just try to relax.I can't relax.

33:06.506 --> 33:09.639
These people took my life
from me, my family.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.687
I need to stop them.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.211
We will, okay?

33:16.255 --> 33:18.257
Just focus.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.564
We're coming out now.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.044
You ready, Your Royal Highness?

33:23.088 --> 33:25.090
Take me home,
Agent Hanna.

33:26.569 --> 33:29.094
Callen, they're coming out.

33:32.749 --> 33:36.492
Collins, is the pilot ready?

33:39.147 --> 33:40.105
Hey!

33:43.282 --> 33:45.066
Bush, what happened?

33:46.546 --> 33:48.026
Shooter on the roof.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.898
He's not alone!

33:50.941 --> 33:52.117
It's the bride, Callen.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.075
The bride!

33:54.119 --> 33:55.642
This car here.

33:59.167 --> 34:00.168
Joe!

34:00.995 --> 34:02.214
I have a shot!

34:02.257 --> 34:03.650
Behind you!

34:14.269 --> 34:15.662
Kensi, baseball cap!

34:24.279 --> 34:27.108
I am in your debt,
Agent Hanna.
Yeah.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.328
Okay, well, let's get you
to the car, all right?

34:29.371 --> 34:32.418
Then we can talk about
that Apocalypse Nowremake.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.076
CIA?

34:38.119 --> 34:39.425
A few years under me.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.340
Never liked her.

34:41.383 --> 34:44.647
You know, that was pretty
stupid, running in like that.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.519
Well, the way I saw it,

34:46.562 --> 34:48.651
I figured I was gonna
save the prince,

34:48.695 --> 34:50.392
or Kensi was gonna shoot me.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.527
Figured I had a 50-50 chance.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.537
Callen!

35:04.580 --> 35:06.104
Wait a minute.
Stop. Stop.

35:08.149 --> 35:10.673
I'm sorry.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.675
For what?

35:12.719 --> 35:14.895
You saved the prince
and his decoy.
No.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.723
Not talking about that.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.464
I'm sorry about your dad.

35:18.507 --> 35:21.336
It was wrong
what happened.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.164
I just...

35:23.208 --> 35:25.340
I couldn't see another way.

35:27.821 --> 35:29.823
Neither could I.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.349
I hope you find him.

35:36.917 --> 35:38.919
Thank you.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.278
What was he talking about?

35:50.322 --> 35:52.324
What happened
with your father?

36:00.941 --> 36:02.595
So, you save a guy's life,

36:02.638 --> 36:04.727
he doesn't even let you
keep the suit?

36:04.771 --> 36:06.033
Oh, he's letting
me keep it.

36:06.076 --> 36:07.687
Oh.It just needed a
few more alterations.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.646
His tailor's sending it
back to me when it's ready.Oh.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.040
Speaking of which, I got
to get a tux for this wedding.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.650
Yeah. I need to get my dress.

36:14.694 --> 36:15.869
Well, first,
we should probably

36:15.912 --> 36:17.262
pick out a venue,
right, maybe a date.

36:17.305 --> 36:18.698
KENSI:
Yeah, but also a guest list

36:18.741 --> 36:20.221
and our wedding vows, and...

36:20.265 --> 36:21.396
Should probably
do a registry, right?

36:21.440 --> 36:23.181
Catering, too.
There's so much to do.

36:23.224 --> 36:26.271
Guys, stop. Don't
force it, okay?

36:26.314 --> 36:27.663
And don't listen to anyone else.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.535
Do things on your time
when you're ready.

36:29.578 --> 36:30.927
Three months,

36:30.971 --> 36:34.235
three years-- we'll all show up
no matter what.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.628
Well, thank you.

36:35.671 --> 36:38.283
That's wise words
from a wise man.Yeah.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.285
But don't wait three years,
okay?

36:40.328 --> 36:42.069
No.No, definitely not three years.

36:42.112 --> 36:42.809
Definitely not.
KENSI:
Yeah.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.332
My mom will be blind.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.334
Hey, so more good news.

36:46.378 --> 36:48.858
Joelle was able to get
in touch with her contact

36:48.902 --> 36:50.425
inside 2GS, and he's willing

36:50.469 --> 36:52.427
to testify
about their illegal activity.

36:52.471 --> 36:54.342
ERIC:
And paired with
the documentary

36:54.386 --> 36:55.952
evidence she amassed,
federal agents

36:55.996 --> 36:57.954
across the country are currently
executing warrants

36:57.998 --> 36:59.652
for the company's entire
board of directors.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.523
Wow. That's amazing.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.830
Does this mean that Joelle can
go back to her family?

37:03.873 --> 37:05.266
Seems like it.
Mm-hmm.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.963
Actually, Callen is
taking her there now.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.356
KENSI:
Huh.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.402
DEEKS: Wow.ERIC: Yeah.

37:26.592 --> 37:29.377
What do I say to them?

37:29.421 --> 37:31.249
Where do I even start?

37:31.292 --> 37:33.425
You're asking
the wrong guy.

37:35.644 --> 37:38.473
I can't even get my sister
to talk to me.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.392
I'm sorry about your family,
Callen.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.701
You don't deserve this.

37:50.224 --> 37:52.922
Neither do you.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.450
And neither do they.

38:00.321 --> 38:03.237
But that... can be fixed.

38:09.156 --> 38:12.333
You need to go in there and
say something, anything.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.251
Eventually, they'll understand.
