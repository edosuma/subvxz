WEBVTT

00:04.638 --> 00:06.507
Hey, uh, so, Deb...

00:06.540 --> 00:08.042
has-has Dad ever
said anything to you

00:08.076 --> 00:08.709
about dating?

00:08.742 --> 00:10.544
No, he seems pretty content

00:10.578 --> 00:12.580
with the ladies on Fox News.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.417
I was thinking about bringing up
the idea with Mom.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.419
Really? Mom dating?

00:18.452 --> 00:20.321
Why, do you think
it's a bad idea?
I don't know.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.489
I mean... are you sure

00:21.522 --> 00:23.391
you can handle her
seeing other people?

00:23.424 --> 00:24.658
(Deb laughs)

00:24.692 --> 00:26.260
Ha-ha. That's disgusting.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.595
Yeah, grow up, Deb.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.063
I think that is
a great idea, Nate.

00:29.097 --> 00:29.763
Thank you, Adam.

00:29.797 --> 00:30.764
Yeah.

00:30.798 --> 00:31.965
Because now you're at that point
where you either

00:31.999 --> 00:33.767
got to give her a ring,
or you gotta move on.
(laughing)

00:33.801 --> 00:35.636
ADAM (laughing):
Yeah...

00:35.669 --> 00:37.338
Hey, you know what, guys?

00:37.371 --> 00:38.406
This is serious,
okay?

00:38.439 --> 00:40.374
I-I need to find
somebody else
to take care of Mom,

00:40.408 --> 00:42.410
Otherwise, I'm never
gonna have time to date,

00:42.443 --> 00:44.278
and I'm gonna be stuck
with Mom forever.
Okay.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.779
All joking aside--
and just for a moment,

00:45.813 --> 00:47.348
because I do want
to come back to

00:47.381 --> 00:49.683
making fun of you
for dating your mom--

00:49.717 --> 00:52.186
but I was watching The Talk
at work the other afternoon...

00:52.220 --> 00:53.421
Every afternoon.

00:53.454 --> 00:54.422
Okay.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.356
It's not just for women.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.590
All right?

00:56.624 --> 00:57.625
I think you're thinking
of The View.

00:57.658 --> 00:58.659
The Talk is edgy.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.296
So they did a story
on this, uh,

01:02.330 --> 01:03.864
dating Web site
for older people.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.201
It's called
FinalChanceforRomance.com."

01:07.235 --> 01:10.171
You know what?
That might be great for Mom.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.173
Oh, I don't know. I don't know
if Mom should be dating.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.608
It might be too risky
this soon after the divorce.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.378
Plus, you two are the only
couple friends that we have.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.546
(laughter)

01:18.579 --> 01:19.747
And we're back.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.276
Yeah.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.344
Hey, Mom. We're gonna
watch the hockey game here.

01:50.378 --> 01:53.514
That's fine. I'm almost finished
with my online dating profile

01:53.547 --> 01:55.449
on that Web site
you showed me.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.585
Oh, yeah? Let's
take a look.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.255
Your user name is "Carol
Miller Who Likes Grapes."

02:01.289 --> 02:04.458
Carol Miller was taken...
and I like grapes.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.827
Wait. Under "What you're
looking for in a man,"

02:06.860 --> 02:08.362
it just says,
"mustache."

02:08.396 --> 02:10.631
I always wanted to kiss
a man with a mustache,

02:10.664 --> 02:13.167
but your father just didn't have
the upper lip strength

02:13.201 --> 02:14.468
to support one.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.238
Wait a second. It says,
"Complete this sentence.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.407
"In the bedroom, I like
to..." dot, dot, dot,

02:19.440 --> 02:21.542
and you wrote,
"Do everything"?

02:21.575 --> 02:24.678
Yeah. I like to read
in there, I exercise.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.614
That's where I wrap presents.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.516
No, no, no,
Mom, you just...
I can...

02:28.549 --> 02:31.452
I fill out my profile
however I see fit. And send.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.288
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
going for my power penny walk.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.523
Adam saw it on The Talk.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.558
"13 thrifty ways

02:37.591 --> 02:39.460
to tone and tighten
your tushy."

02:39.493 --> 02:42.963
Aisha says, "The more
these cans wiggle, the less

02:42.996 --> 02:45.233
my can will jiggle."

02:45.266 --> 02:46.500
(rhythmic rattling)

02:50.538 --> 02:55.343
(woman giggling)

02:55.376 --> 02:56.710
You heard that, too, right?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.279
(woman giggles)

02:58.312 --> 03:01.282
Come on, man. Don't make me
that guy that never knew

03:01.315 --> 03:03.584
his best friend had girls locked
in the basement.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.885
(woman giggling)

03:04.918 --> 03:06.887
No. It's coming
from the computer.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.256
(woman giggling)

03:08.289 --> 03:09.757
My mom just got tickled.

03:11.259 --> 03:14.428
Looks like when you flirt
with somebody on this Web site,

03:14.462 --> 03:17.531
they call it a tickle,
and she's got a bunch already.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.899
All right, let's check
these guys out.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.602
No, not him. No.
(laughs)

03:21.635 --> 03:25.273
Not him. Ugh! God, who gets
braces in their 60s?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.640
No, no, no, no,
don't just delete 'em.

03:26.674 --> 03:27.808
If that guy
lives long enough,

03:27.841 --> 03:29.543
he's gonna have
a dynamite smile.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.745
But, Ray, this could end up
being my stepfather.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.347
I refuse to spend my nights

03:33.381 --> 03:35.316
picking pieces of meat out
of his headgear, no.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.318
Hmm.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.986
Hey, this guy hasn't
tickled Mom yet,

03:39.019 --> 03:40.521
but he looks great--
this Sarge.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.357
I like that screen
name-- "Strong."

03:43.391 --> 03:44.458
Look at that mustache.

03:44.492 --> 03:48.696
Ah, Mom would love to get swept
up in that lip broom.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.863
And he's got a boat.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.532
Two boats! Nate,
we can race!

03:51.565 --> 03:53.701
How many times have we
talked about racing boats?!

03:53.734 --> 03:56.970
As of right now, just once,
but it sounds amazing.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.606
(laughing)
Look at this.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.908
He likes hockey, working out
and sipping whiskey.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.544
Oh!
What? Is this a computer,
or a mirror?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.446
He is perfect for me.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.780
Her. Us.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.549
(laughing):
It's about time

04:08.582 --> 04:10.651
Carol dates a Nathan
her own age anyway.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.686
Give him a tickle.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.756
What? No, no, no.
No, no, no. No, no, no.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.658
I-I can't pretend
to be my mom.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.427
We'll wait for her
to decide if she...

04:19.460 --> 04:21.495
No, no, no, no, no. We don't
have time to wait, man.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.797
A dude like that can get
snatched up at any second.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.833
Tickle his ass!

04:29.637 --> 04:30.938
Ah...

04:30.971 --> 04:32.306
(woman giggles)

04:32.340 --> 04:33.607
The Sarge has been tickled!

04:33.641 --> 04:36.577
(laughter)

04:36.610 --> 04:38.412
(woman giggling)
Tickled him twice. Why not?

04:38.446 --> 04:39.580
Why not?!

04:39.613 --> 04:41.482
Tickle him till he pees!

04:41.515 --> 04:43.951
(laughing)

04:43.984 --> 04:45.686
(woman giggling)

04:45.719 --> 04:46.720
He tickled us back!

04:46.754 --> 04:48.622
(screams)
Oh, man!

04:48.656 --> 04:49.690
(laughing)

04:52.125 --> 04:54.027
Ah!
(computer chimes)

04:54.061 --> 04:56.530
"Have you ever
been to Rome?"

04:56.564 --> 04:58.866
Okay, I got this.
Um, what if I write,

04:58.899 --> 05:00.901
"No, but I'd love
to go some day?"

05:00.934 --> 05:02.536
No, no, no, no, no.
It makes it sound

05:02.570 --> 05:03.771
like she's begging
for an invite.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.539
Lean back and let
him come to you.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.675
(sniffles)

05:07.708 --> 05:10.711
"Never been to Rome,
but that's probably because

05:10.744 --> 05:12.980
I'm more of a Paris girl."

05:13.013 --> 05:16.350
And... winky face.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.619
(computer chimes)

05:18.652 --> 05:20.554
"Maybe we'll go some day.

05:20.588 --> 05:23.524
Until then, what are you doing
this weekend?"

05:23.557 --> 05:25.526
Whoo...!

05:25.559 --> 05:27.728
Sarge came to play!

05:27.761 --> 05:29.062
(laughs)

05:29.096 --> 05:31.064
Then let's play.

05:31.098 --> 05:34.768
"Saturday night,
I've got box at a hockey game.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.004
Want to come?"

05:37.037 --> 05:38.706
(laughter)

05:38.739 --> 05:39.740
(sighs)

05:39.773 --> 05:41.842
(laughter)

05:43.677 --> 05:44.745
Oh.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.414
Mm.
Mm.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.648
Mm.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.049
(laughter)

05:49.082 --> 05:51.919
(sighs)
Where's a...?

05:51.952 --> 05:54.588
What's taking so long?

05:54.622 --> 05:56.957
Usually writes back
in a couple seconds.
I know.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.627
I'm sure he's just crafting
a witty response here.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.662
(clears throat)

06:03.631 --> 06:05.533
Okay, now I'm getting nervous.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.401
Why'd you ask him
out so soon, man?!

06:07.435 --> 06:08.836
We got him nibbling
on the bait,

06:08.869 --> 06:11.539
and you just yanked your
worm right out of his mouth!

06:11.572 --> 06:13.140
Come on,
what was I supposed to do?

06:13.173 --> 06:15.443
I can't just sit here with
my worm in his mouth all night.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.945
At some point,
I have to yank my rod!

06:17.978 --> 06:19.780
(computer chimes)

06:19.813 --> 06:22.650
"Sorry. Watching hockey.
Crazy goal."

06:22.683 --> 06:24.552
There was a goal?

06:25.653 --> 06:27.955
Oh!
Oh!

06:27.988 --> 06:29.122
(computer chimes)

06:29.156 --> 06:30.891
"Would love to come
to the game with you."

06:30.924 --> 06:32.593
BOTH:
Oh!

06:32.626 --> 06:35.195
Oh!
(screams,
laughs)

06:35.228 --> 06:37.498
Oh, Mom, big news.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.566
We found you a date,

06:38.599 --> 06:39.700
and he's perfect.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.834
Have you been messing
with my profile?

06:40.868 --> 06:41.869
I told you...

06:41.902 --> 06:43.904
Oh, yum!

06:45.473 --> 06:48.609
I'd like to get swept up
in that lip broom.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.018
(indistinct chatter,
laughing)

06:58.051 --> 07:00.854
And tell them about the text
we sent to the Sarge.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.624
Oh, he was telling me
about his workout program,

07:03.657 --> 07:05.593
so I said, "Can't we just see
the results?" Winky face.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.728
So, then he sent
an emoticon of a barbell.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.830
Then I sent an emoticon
of a blushing angel.

07:09.863 --> 07:13.467
Then he said I was a hoot,
so I sent a picture of an owl,

07:13.501 --> 07:15.769
thus, proving his point!

07:15.803 --> 07:19.006
So you were up all night
sexting with a 73-year-old man?

07:19.039 --> 07:21.108
I wasn't sexting.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.043
I wasn't talking to you.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.913
Well, technically,
I was the one at the keyboard,

07:25.946 --> 07:28.081
but mom was standing behind me
the whole time.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.017
For a while,
but after I went to bed,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.519
I could still hear you typing.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.786
(laughs)

07:32.820 --> 07:35.022
You know, I don't think
any of these are right.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.256
Well, Carol, it's not
all about the dress.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.626
It's like the other afternoon,
Sharon was telling Sarah...

07:38.659 --> 07:39.793
Please don't refer to the women

07:39.827 --> 07:41.094
on The Talk
by their first names.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.663
You don't know them,
and they don't know you.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.732
Well, I'm sure they've
gotten all my letters.

07:44.765 --> 07:48.101
Look, the point is, don't
focus on the clothes.
Uh-huh.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.970
Focus on the woman
wearing the clothes.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.273
You need an outfit that
accentuates your silhouette.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.043
I'll go get you a sleeping bag.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.211
Dad, not now, please.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.848
It's okay. I remember
when I was alone.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.083
So much anger and jealousy.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.253
I forgive you, Tom, and I hope
one day, you find someone, too.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.621
What are you
talking about?

08:07.655 --> 08:09.056
Oh, haven't
you heard?

08:09.089 --> 08:10.257
I met a wonderful man online,

08:10.290 --> 08:13.527
and we're going on a date
to see my favorite hockey group,

08:13.561 --> 08:14.962
the Washington Capitals.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.097
You don't like the Capitals.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.899
I do now.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.068
And this year, I think
they could compete

08:21.101 --> 08:23.270
because they just need

08:23.303 --> 08:25.138
defense to win the championship?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.006
Perfect.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.175
You can't dress her up
in fancy clothes

08:28.208 --> 08:29.610
and tell her what to say.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.211
That's false advertising.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.647
At least slap
a warning label on her

08:33.681 --> 08:35.282
with a list of side effects.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.784
"May cause

08:36.817 --> 08:40.187
headaches, anxiety
and loss of sexual drive."

08:42.355 --> 08:43.657
(horn honks)

08:43.691 --> 08:44.792
Oh, Mom, that's Ray for you.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.259
Oh. Oh.
Come on,
let's go.
Yeah.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.995
Grab your bag here.
Oh.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.631
Now, have a great haircut, and
be back at our house by 5:00.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.800
Maybe 5:15
if Ray and I stop

08:52.833 --> 08:54.167
to pre-game with
a little rosé.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.204
I'm charming with
a light buzz on.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.873
Oh! (laughs)

08:59.907 --> 09:01.842
Putting a lot of
effort into this.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.177
The Sarge must be
some catch.
Oh.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.646
You have no idea.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.981
He's rich,
he owns multiple watercraft.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.250
The guy just finished
his sixth triathlon.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.084
You know what?
You know what?

09:11.118 --> 09:13.587
He once turned down
an offer to model

09:13.621 --> 09:14.888
for Tommy Bahama.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.590
And get this.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.827
He doesn't often drink beer,
but when he does,

09:19.860 --> 09:22.362
it's free because
he owns his own brewery.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.633
Doesn't sound that great to me.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.901
Has he ever danced
with Carol Burnett?

09:27.935 --> 09:30.638
Uh... no. Have you?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.272
No.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.747
There you are.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.982
How long does it take to get my
mom's hair done? Where is she?

09:42.015 --> 09:44.217
Okay, you know how you have
to prepare yourself

09:44.251 --> 09:47.387
before you talk to a person
with a glass eye or a baby arm?

09:47.420 --> 09:50.257
Yeah.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.292
Do that.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.262
(sighs)
Tada!

09:56.764 --> 09:57.965
(laughs)

09:57.998 --> 09:59.199
It's fun, huh?

09:59.232 --> 10:01.769
Oh. So fun.

10:01.802 --> 10:06.173
I want to drop a marble in there
and see where it comes out.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.408
I got to go get dressed
before the Sarge gets here.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.877
This is so
exciting! (laughs)

10:09.910 --> 10:11.912
If this works out,
I wonder if we'll live

10:11.945 --> 10:14.214
on one of his boats or
in one of his houses.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.916
Water or land?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.185
The mermaid's dilemma.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.388
(quietly):
Ray, what the hell, man?

10:21.421 --> 10:24.257
I left the beauty shop for
ten minutes to get a snow cone.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.960
While I was gone,
she asked for fancy.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.263
You say "fancy" in a black
salon, you're gonna get fancy.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.832
We're way past fancy.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.333
My mom's head looks
like a trophy

10:33.366 --> 10:34.702
at the Calligraphy Awards.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.104
(doorbell rings)

10:37.137 --> 10:38.338
It's him.
It's him!

10:38.371 --> 10:40.307
It's him. Okay, um,
you go upstairs

10:40.340 --> 10:41.942
and help my mom.
I'll get the door.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.745
Hi, I'm Nathan,
Carol's son.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.214
It's great to meet you.
(chuckles)

10:47.247 --> 10:49.349
Uh, she'll be down
in one second. Can I, uh...

10:49.382 --> 10:52.319
get you a whiskey and ginger?

10:52.352 --> 10:54.321
Yeah. How'd you know that?

10:54.354 --> 10:57.725
Uh... Well, my mom must've
mentioned it. I...

10:57.758 --> 10:59.259
Yeah, you and your mom
are close.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.361
Half of her texts are about you.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.363
She even
suggested

11:03.396 --> 11:05.432
I take you for a ride
in my boat.

11:05.465 --> 11:08.301
What? That's so crazy.
Mom, she's a...

11:08.335 --> 11:10.337
Next weekend is supposed
to be nice though.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.141
Ooh!
(chuckles)

11:14.174 --> 11:15.943
It works, right?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.946
Like they say in AA,
it works if you work it.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.714
So let me see you work it.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.184
Damn, Carol!
(whoops)

11:24.217 --> 11:25.786
If you were working
any harder,
Yeah?

11:25.819 --> 11:27.955
that dress gonna have
to file a W-2 form.

11:27.988 --> 11:28.956
(both chuckle)

11:28.989 --> 11:30.357
Oh, hey.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.893
Something's digging
into my back.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.395
What...
Let me see that. Oh.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.364
Some dumb-dumb left
the security tag on.
Oh, no.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.900
Oh, this can't be
happening. What do I do?
(stuttering)

11:39.933 --> 11:41.268
What do I do? What do I do?
Calm down, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.803
Look me in my eyes.
I got you.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.037
I know how to take
these things off.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.072
You believe me?

11:46.874 --> 11:49.309
(phone rings)

11:49.342 --> 11:50.811
Hello?

11:50.844 --> 11:52.946
You need to bring over
the other dresses now.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.082
Mom, I was getting
ready to take a bath.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.349
Debbie, it's an emergency.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.085
The security tag exploded,

11:58.118 --> 12:01.288
and the back of my dress
looks like I sat on a Smurf!

12:03.891 --> 12:05.458
I am so sorry.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.460
(gags, coughs)

12:07.494 --> 12:09.296
In the moment, it
seemed very reasonable

12:09.329 --> 12:11.765
that I could pry the security
tag off with my teeth.

12:11.799 --> 12:16.169
In hindsight, I now see
that this was the only outcome.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.405
So, "Sarge." What is that?
Police? Military?

12:18.438 --> 12:22.375
MAN:
Well, both, actually. Uh, you
know, I was military police.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.345
And, look, y-you don't have
to call me by my screen name.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.480
You can call me Frank.
Wow.

12:27.514 --> 12:30.017
Look at us, Frank.
Two sips of whiskey, Frank,

12:30.050 --> 12:33.186
and we're already past
the screen names, Frank.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.389
A-And, forgive me,
what was your name again, son?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.892
It doesn't matter.
"Son" is fine.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.460
(chuckles)

12:49.236 --> 12:51.338
You know,
I normally take showers,

12:51.371 --> 12:53.807
but, uh, Debbie had already
made this bath,

12:53.841 --> 12:55.342
I had already made this crudité.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.878
It just... felt like the
universe wanted this to happen.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.248
Debbie's not in
there, is she?

13:01.281 --> 13:05.152
No. No, she went to bring Carol
a new dress for her big date.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.020
You might want to leave because
these bubbles are popping

13:07.054 --> 13:08.421
at an alarming rate.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.957
The date's tonight?

13:09.990 --> 13:12.025
Yeah. They're going to the game
with Nathan and Ray.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.226
Listen, Tom,
I'm starting to feel

13:13.260 --> 13:14.294
a little bit awkward in here,

13:14.327 --> 13:15.896
so maybe if you could
just, uh...

13:17.030 --> 13:20.167
...just sit and visit
for a while, uh...

13:20.200 --> 13:23.470
They're all going
to the hockey game, huh?

13:23.503 --> 13:25.205
Listen, Tom--
and I'm not just saying this

13:25.238 --> 13:27.207
because I'm naked in a room
with my father-in-law

13:27.240 --> 13:29.276
and I want that to end
as soon as possible-- but...

13:29.309 --> 13:30.543
if this is bothering you,

13:30.577 --> 13:32.212
I think that you should do
something about it

13:32.245 --> 13:33.380
before it's too late.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.915
You know what?

13:34.948 --> 13:36.483
I think I will.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.186
Um...

13:39.219 --> 13:40.153
actually, I came in here

13:40.187 --> 13:42.455
because Mikayla was
in the other bathroom.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.392
Do you mind?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.394
(sighs)
Fine.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.196
You've got about a minute.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.563
(grunts)

13:53.133 --> 13:54.567
(indistinct chatter)
Hey, j...

13:57.971 --> 13:59.472
Okay, I'm-I'm sure there's
a perfectly logical

13:59.506 --> 14:02.442
and-and possibly hilarious story
that explains why Debbie's here

14:02.475 --> 14:03.710
and, Mom, you're
in a new dress

14:03.743 --> 14:07.114
and, Ray, you look like you've
been bobbing for urinal cakes,

14:07.147 --> 14:09.349
but... that story's just
gonna have to wait

14:09.382 --> 14:11.018
'cause Sarge
is getting impatient.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.485
Nathan, I'm just starting
to feel...

14:12.519 --> 14:13.653
No, Mom, you look
fantastic, okay?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.123
So, Debbie, thank you for
coming by and, Ray, just...

14:16.156 --> 14:17.424
wipe off your
face and tell Sarge

14:17.457 --> 14:19.960
that we'll be down
there in a minute.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.228
Take it from a
former shoplifter,

14:21.261 --> 14:24.364
that blue's not
coming out.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.365
Okay, Mom, listen,

14:25.398 --> 14:27.134
we got to learn how to
line dance real quick

14:27.167 --> 14:28.435
(groans)
'cause Sarge is taking
us to a cowboy bar

14:28.468 --> 14:30.437
after the game.
Don't worry.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.105
I've downloaded some
instructional videos

14:32.139 --> 14:33.506
off the Internet.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.109
Nathan, I-I can't learn
to line dance in five minutes.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.945
Sure you can!
Look, it's basically

14:37.978 --> 14:39.546
just the Electric Slide
except for every once in a while

14:39.579 --> 14:42.015
all you got to do is you got
to kick your hand with your boot

14:42.049 --> 14:44.952
and spin around
your invisible lasso.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.586
Nathan, stop it.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.455
I'm tired of pretending.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.191
Look at me. I'm wearing a dress
I would never wear.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.460
I've been studying hockey
for three days straight.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.129
My hair looks
like a chocolate fountain.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.465
(groans)
You father was right.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.333
This is false advertising!

15:00.367 --> 15:02.469
I mean, I'm just not
the Carol you created

15:02.502 --> 15:04.237
on the World Wide Web.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.539
That Carol was witty
and fun and exciting.

15:06.573 --> 15:10.210
She was like a Hollywood Square.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.213
I'm just some old frumpadump

15:13.246 --> 15:15.248
who likes grapes.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.251
I'm sorry. I just
can't do this.

15:18.285 --> 15:21.454
Mom, I-I don't want you to do
anything you don't want to do.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.255
I just...

15:22.289 --> 15:24.057
I thought that
Sarge was perfect,

15:24.091 --> 15:26.126
and I wanted you to
be perfect for him.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.995
I thought that's
what you wanted.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.497
It is but not like this.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.632
I want to be me.
I want to be the Carol

15:32.665 --> 15:34.634
who sits at home
in her sweatpants.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.736
Like back when I was
dating you.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.538
(chuckles)

15:38.571 --> 15:42.142
And if Sarge doesn't want that,
then it's his loss.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.610
I love who you are.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.412
If you're good
enough for me,

15:45.445 --> 15:47.580
then you're good
enough for Frank.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.516
He said I could
call him Frank.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.551
(indistinct shouting downstairs)

15:54.687 --> 15:57.157
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, Nate,
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:57.190 --> 15:58.625
I don't know what to do here,
man. Two old white dudes

15:58.658 --> 16:01.461
fighting-- if I jump in it,
we all know who's going to jail!

16:01.494 --> 16:03.196
Hey. Come on.
What's going on? No, no, no.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.198
Come on, come on, come on.
Let go. All right, all right,

16:05.232 --> 16:07.000
all right, all right...
That lunatic

16:07.034 --> 16:09.269
burst through that door
and started swinging at me.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.338
You will never
replace me!

16:11.371 --> 16:13.006
A-ha! I knew it!

16:13.040 --> 16:15.208
You're jealous! Well, too bad.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.744
If you liked it, you should've
kept a ring on it.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.048
Hi, I'm Carol.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.050
I'm gonna go get changed.

16:23.083 --> 16:26.086
I'll be back
in a mustache... minute.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.089
Hey, look, buddy,
if you still have feelings

16:29.122 --> 16:30.557
for your ex-wife...

16:30.590 --> 16:33.726
What? I don't care about her.
I was talking about my son.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.563
What?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.098
Oh, don't act so innocent.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.033
I hear the way
you talk about him,

16:40.067 --> 16:42.535
like he's the father
you always wanted.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.471
"Sarge runs triathlons,

16:44.504 --> 16:45.738
"Sarge makes
his own beer,

16:45.772 --> 16:47.474
"Sarge remembers
to take his socks off

16:47.507 --> 16:49.142
before he gets in the shower."

16:51.678 --> 16:55.582
Sir, I can assure you I have no
interest in your son whatsoever.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.317
Well, that's not...
entirely true, Frank.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.186
I mean, obviously there's
a connection here.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.454
We've had a good night.
We're-we're buddies.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.123
We're not buddies. Buddies?

17:03.156 --> 17:04.591
I can't be buddies with someone

17:04.624 --> 17:06.726
who wears
a citrus-based cologne.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.729
It's not a cologne. It's just
a very fragrant body wash.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.598
And, if anything,
it's more oaky than citrus.

17:11.631 --> 17:15.568
Hey, look, I was just pretending
to be nice because I like Carol.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.070
Oh, really?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.471
Oh, you like Carol?

17:18.505 --> 17:20.640
Well, did you hear that, guys?

17:20.673 --> 17:21.708
He doesn't like me.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.710
He likes Carol.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.079
Guess what?

17:26.113 --> 17:28.115
(whispers):
I am Carol.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.387
So every-every flirty text,

17:34.421 --> 17:37.257
every "LOL,"
every perfectly timed emoticon,

17:37.290 --> 17:39.092
that was all me.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.493
Ray helped, too.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.396
Oh. I'm cool, Nate. You take it.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.567
Man, I should've never tried
to date on the Internet.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.568
Brother.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.537
What a bunch of weirdos.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.706
Who's he
calling a weirdo?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.608
CAROL:
Can someone please
help me?

17:57.877 --> 17:59.846
You know, Dad, I-I just want
to say I'm sorry

17:59.879 --> 18:01.514
if I got a little carried away.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.116
I-I really wasn't
trying to replace you.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.284
It's not your fault.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.785
As your dad,
I need to try harder

18:05.818 --> 18:07.787
to do the things
that you enjoy.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.789
Hockey's not that bad.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.792
And my bird binoculars
come in handy, too.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.794
Oh, look.

18:14.827 --> 18:18.465
Couple of pigeons
up there in the rafters.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.734
Oh, Ray, someone just went
into the penalty house.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.703
Ooh.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.509
I'm sorry you couldn't
get that blue off your face,

18:29.542 --> 18:30.877
but I really think
you made it work.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.412
Aw, thank you.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.680
Look like a damn idiot.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.248
("Charge" plays)

18:35.282 --> 18:37.850
Sorry we ruined
your date, Mom.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.520
It's all right. Before
I can find someone else,

18:40.553 --> 18:43.790
I got to find me. Like tonight
I found out I like hockey,

18:43.823 --> 18:47.327
which gives us another excuse
to hang out together.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.662
Long as everyone knows
we're just hanging out.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.498
Oh, oh, oh!

18:51.531 --> 18:52.499
Look who's on the Kiss Cam!

18:52.532 --> 18:53.500
(Carol gasps)
(Ray laughs)

18:53.533 --> 18:54.834
RAY:
Kiss! Kiss!

18:54.867 --> 18:57.570
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

18:57.604 --> 18:59.606
(cheering)
(Ray laughing)

19:06.213 --> 19:07.680
We want to thank
our special guest host today

19:07.714 --> 19:09.882
for joining us
at the Talk Table.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.752
From WXDN in Leesburg, Virginia,

19:12.785 --> 19:16.556
up-and-coming newscaster,
Nathan Miller!

19:16.589 --> 19:17.757
(cheering and applause)

19:20.460 --> 19:21.861
I... Thank you so much.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.397
I-I still can't believe
that I've got this opportunity.

19:24.431 --> 19:27.200
It has been so much fun.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.868
You were fabulous,
my darling.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.703
You promise me
you'll come back?

19:30.737 --> 19:32.572
Oh, are you kidding?
I can't wait.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.707
It would be fantas... And
I can't also wait to get home

19:34.741 --> 19:37.944
and try that awesome
bacon milkshake recipe!

19:37.977 --> 19:40.647
(cheering and applause)
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes,

19:40.680 --> 19:42.215
and it is good!

19:42.249 --> 19:43.783
(chuckling):
Oh...
But...

19:43.816 --> 19:46.753
we have one other surprise
for you.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.787
We know that
you've been spending

19:47.820 --> 19:50.890
a lot of time lately
with a very special lady.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.960
And after 42 years,
she wants you

19:53.993 --> 19:56.796
to make an honest woman
out of her.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.965
WOMEN:
Surprise wedding!

19:58.998 --> 20:00.933
(cheering and applause)

20:06.339 --> 20:07.940
Oh, no, no, no, no.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.276
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.743
No!

20:10.777 --> 20:13.012
No, no, no! No, no!
We were not dating!

20:13.045 --> 20:15.415
She's my mother!
She's my mother! This is wrong!

20:15.448 --> 20:17.917
This is morally
and legally wrong!

20:17.950 --> 20:20.520
(snorts)
Oh. Aw, man.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.423
I finally had a dream about The
Talk and I wasn't even in it.
