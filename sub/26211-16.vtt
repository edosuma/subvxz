I would do without you guys.
- You're welcome. I know.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.266

you're at school

18:55.300 --> 18:56.333
and the rich girl has
a birthday party...

18:56.367 --> 18:58.233
- Happy birthday.

18:58.266 --> 19:01.333
- And you all hate her,
but you want that goodie bag.

19:01.367 --> 19:03.533
- Love you.
- No, I love you guys.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.400
- I love added chaos so much.

19:09.433 --> 19:11.333
I was bored.
- Okay, here we go.

19:14.467 --> 19:16.567
- God, this is so good.
- Yeah.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.600
- Oh, God, they gotta eat fast.

19:19.633 --> 19:22.233
Faster.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.500
- Laura, Laura, Kate.
Can you come down

19:26.533 --> 19:29.533
to the pantry for service
when you have a chance?

19:31.300 --> 19:33.066
- Wow, this looks spectacular.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.700
- I went on a date one time and
I ordered the steak tartare

19:35.734 --> 19:37.433
and then he ordered well-done.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.100
And I said, "That's it,
we're done."

19:39.133 --> 19:41.500
- So this is a sous vide
New Zealand beef filet

19:41.533 --> 19:44.066
with a thyme and red wine
demiglace,

19:44.100 --> 19:45.633
truffle,
creamy brussel sprouts,

19:45.667 --> 19:47.633
and some roasted zucchini.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.266
So enjoy.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.633

19:50.667 --> 19:54.333
- I'm testing the durability
of my Spanx right now.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.700
- Will you please go up,
if you're not Josiah.

19:56.734 --> 19:58.500
When those fireworks go off
very soon,

19:58.533 --> 20:00.433
you all are gonna run down

20:00.467 --> 20:02.533
and make that dinner table look
like a birthday celebration.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.100
- Copy.

20:04.133 --> 20:06.533
- 'Kay, let's make this
look pretty.

20:06.567 --> 20:08.700
- Seriously?
Are you kidding?

20:08.734 --> 20:11.333
- What do you want for dessert,
candles, sparklers?

20:11.367 --> 20:12.700
- Let's do a couple sparklers
for the cake.

20:12.734 --> 20:15.300
I would have wanted to
integrate those disco lights.

20:15.333 --> 20:16.433
[laughs]

20:16.467 --> 20:18.333
- Phase two of punish Kate.

20:18.367 --> 20:22.333
Surprise, we're gonna make
a disco tower for dessert.

20:22.367 --> 20:23.567
You can have a sea slug
on the table

20:23.600 --> 20:25.367
or you can have a disco ball
dessert.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.533
- I want both, Mommy.
- Yeah, no kidding.

20:26.567 --> 20:28.100
Well, you're not
getting either,

20:28.133 --> 20:29.567
which is real ironic.
- Yo, yo, yo.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.567

going off at 9:00.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.533
He knows the longer he takes,
the more stressed out I get.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.333
He's doing this on purpose.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.567
It's 8:55, Adrian.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.400
- Coming up...

20:40.433 --> 20:42.500
- I organized the ----ing
birthday party for you.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.300
I organized everything
for you on this ----ing trip,

20:45.333 --> 20:48.367
and you have been treating me
like sh--.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.333

20:54.000 --> 20:55.533
- Just to have the light coming
up through the bottom.

20:55.567 --> 20:57.700
- What about the--
what are those glasses?

20:57.734 --> 21:01.200
- Go get a cognac glass.
You're a genius, Josiah.

21:01.233 --> 21:03.600
Spray a light bronze mist.

21:03.633 --> 21:06.200
Like that.
I like that.

- A little bit.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.700

37:53.000 --> 37:55.633
I would never want to make
anybody feel like that,

37:55.667 --> 37:57.567
and I don't want to hurt
anybody either.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.133
- It is what it is,
and I just needed

37:59.166 --> 38:01.033
to get that off my chest
before we left the boat.

38:01.066 --> 38:05.300
- Well, thank you. Thank you
for coming to me about it.

38:05.333 --> 38:08.734
- ♪ Last night, I got so much
sleep in the club ♪

38:08.767 --> 38:11.000
[both laugh]

38:11.033 --> 38:13.066
- Yeah!
- That was ----ing impressive.

38:14.734 --> 38:18.100
- The one that you worked at?
[laughter]

38:23.133 --> 38:24.700
- I'm done.
I'm ready.

38:24.734 --> 38:26.133
Dude.
- See you later, brother.

38:26.166 --> 38:27.700
- I think yachting's cool,

38:27.734 --> 38:30.100
but I don't know if it's
really for me long-term.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.633
Thanks for all your help
with intro to yacht life, man.

38:32.667 --> 38:35.700
I am going back to Mississippi,
where I'll fight fires.

38:35.734 --> 38:39.100
That's the plan for now,
subject to change.

38:39.133 --> 38:41.333
It was awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

38:41.367 --> 38:44.000
It was good to meet you.

38:45.633 --> 38:47.533
I think you're
a pretty cool dude.

38:48.567 --> 38:49.767
I'm just kidding.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.633
I think you're amazing too,
so let's connect,

38:52.667 --> 38:55.600
maybe knock boots together
for some old times' sake, huh?

38:55.633 --> 38:57.667
- [laughs]

38:57.700 --> 38:59.633
Tyler was an unexpected,

38:59.667 --> 39:02.033
for lack of a better term,
gift on the boat.

39:02.066 --> 39:04.066
Unfortunately, I anticipated
a little bit more

39:04.100 --> 39:06.033
and it didn't happen,

39:06.066 --> 39:08.667
but I hope it's not
the end of our friendship.

39:12.700 --> 39:16.166
- See you ----ers later.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.000
- I gotta go.
Love you, boo.

39:18.033 --> 39:19.200
- Cheers, bud.

39:19.233 --> 39:21.133
- I would definitely
do this again.

39:21.166 --> 39:23.600
I would like to think that
I would do it differently.

39:23.633 --> 39:25.734
Just, like, I want
respect from my peers,

39:25.767 --> 39:27.367
I have to give it.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.200
I will always stand up
for myself.

39:29.233 --> 39:31.633
I just have to work
on my delivery.

39:31.667 --> 39:33.667
- Rhylee, see you later,
my love.

39:33.700 --> 39:36.633
Rhylee and I have been on
a rollercoaster this season,

39:36.667 --> 39:38.400
but I'm just glad we made it.

39:38.433 --> 39:41.100
We finished on a good note.

39:47.767 --> 39:49.767
- Okay, I think I'm pretty set.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.700
This season, I learned to
be more patient with myself,

39:51.734 --> 39:54.433
and reaffirms
that I'm not perfect.

39:54.467 --> 39:58.100
I sometimes make mistakes, and
I just have to own up to it.

39:58.133 --> 40:00.000
- I'll see you.

40:00.033 --> 40:02.200
- Captain Lee.
Thank you.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.233
Thank you for this season.
- Well done.

40:04.266 --> 40:06.433
- I accepted a job as
a private chef in New York

40:06.467 --> 40:08.166
cooking for
a very wealthy couple.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.667
Many Tahitian blessings.
- Thanks, buddy.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.700
Take care of yourself.
- We'll see where it goes.

40:12.734 --> 40:15.100
Namaste.

40:18.233 --> 40:20.467
- All right, bros.
Ross is out, bro.

40:20.500 --> 40:23.734
I'm sad. I've gotta
say good-bye to the crew,

40:23.767 --> 40:25.166
especially to my cuz, Ash.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.734
I love, love, love you, my man.

40:26.767 --> 40:28.633
- My cuz, I'll come visit you,
all right?

40:28.667 --> 40:30.066
- For sure.
But I'm super excited

40:30.100 --> 40:31.433
to go back home.

40:31.467 --> 40:33.433
I can't wait to see my kid
and see Allison.

40:33.467 --> 40:35.200
Thank you so much.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.700
- Take care of yourself.

40:36.734 --> 40:38.166
- I'm so proud
of the deck team.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.734
We've come such a long way.
I love yachting,

40:40.767 --> 40:44.166
and I'm gonna be doing this
for a very long time.

40:44.200 --> 40:48.433
Yeah, ----ing boy.

40:48.467 --> 40:51.000
- You done? You almost packed?
- Yeah, nearly.

40:51.033 --> 40:52.734
Besides meeting Ashton,
of course,

40:52.767 --> 40:54.233
I am most happy about
our interior team

40:54.266 --> 40:56.000
ending on a good note.

40:56.033 --> 40:57.500
Never in a million years
would I have thought

40:57.533 --> 40:59.767
that Kate and Josiah
were to be my friends,

41:00.000 --> 41:01.667
but they definitely are now.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.200
- I'd work with you again
in a heartbeat.

41:03.233 --> 41:04.767
- Same.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.233
This season couldn't
have ended any better.

41:06.266 --> 41:07.767
We're leaving now.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.133
- Are you guys leaving
together?

41:09.166 --> 41:10.166
- Yeah.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.233
- I kind of did the math

41:11.266 --> 41:12.467
and checked the calendar,

41:12.500 --> 41:13.667
and I might have a night

41:13.700 --> 41:15.166
or two to spend with Laura,

41:15.200 --> 41:17.066
and it excites me.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.100
- Bring it in. Bring it in.
- Aw, baby.

41:19.133 --> 41:22.233
- For me, this season
was about people,

41:22.266 --> 41:25.233
how precious those bonds
are between people.

41:25.266 --> 41:27.266
I mean, I was faced with
a near-death experience,

41:27.300 --> 41:30.133
and...

41:30.166 --> 41:32.467
the first thing I wanted to do
when I got onto that boat

41:32.500 --> 41:34.500
was just to hug everybody,

41:34.533 --> 41:36.767
because in those moments,
that's what's real.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
That's what's important.

41:39.033 --> 41:40.266
- Bye.
- Bye!

41:40.300 --> 41:42.000
We'll miss you.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.333
- Feels weird leaving
the yacht.

41:43.367 --> 41:46.000
- It's kind of exciting.
- New adventures.

41:46.033 --> 41:47.767
- Yeah, exactly.

41:49.166 --> 41:51.066
- And now the best till last.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.767
- Do you think we're gonna go
through separation anxiety?

41:53.000 --> 41:54.500
Like, go to talk to you
and you're not gonna be there?

41:54.533 --> 41:56.266
- I think so.

41:56.300 --> 41:58.767
I don't really like to plan
too much in the future.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.767
I'm loving being second stew.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.266
I definitely see myself
stepping up

42:02.300 --> 42:03.500
and being chief stew one day.

42:03.533 --> 42:05.767
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.700
- I'm definitely gonna miss
Kate the most.

42:07.734 --> 42:10.700
We've become really, really,
really amazing friends,

42:10.734 --> 42:13.133
and I think we will be
forever.

42:13.166 --> 42:15.533
I love you.
- Love you too.

42:15.567 --> 42:18.033
[sniffles]
Ugh.

42:18.066 --> 42:20.300
- Bye, "Seanna."

42:27.600 --> 42:29.533
- Hi.
- Hey, kiddo.

42:29.567 --> 42:31.734
Good crew. I enjoyed
working with all of them.

42:31.767 --> 42:33.133
- Amazing crew.

42:33.166 --> 42:35.033
Like, when there's
a crew that's all good,

42:35.066 --> 42:36.767
gets along, it's like magical.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.033
This season was a wild ride.

42:39.066 --> 42:40.533
There were ups.
There were downs.

42:40.567 --> 42:42.533
There were near-deaths.
There were firings.

42:42.567 --> 42:44.166
See you in Florida.
- Bye, sweetie. Bye.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.033
- Bye.

42:46.066 --> 42:49.200
But being in Tahiti made
yachting feel new again for me,

42:49.233 --> 42:51.300
and I think it was
our best season ever.

42:51.333 --> 42:53.300
Nana, Tahiti.

43:03.166 --> 43:06.166
