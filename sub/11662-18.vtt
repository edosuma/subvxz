(calm music playing)

00:44.400 --> 00:48.100
(birds chirping)

01:04.667 --> 01:08.300
Well, Dorothy, I'm ready to go to work.
How do I look?

01:08.367 --> 01:10.500
Ah, Ma, you look adorable.

01:10.567 --> 01:14.633
Adorable? I want to look aggressive,
powerful, like a corporate killer.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.433
Lose the hat.

01:20.066 --> 01:24.600
Perfect. Perfect. Now you look like the
activities director at a retirement home.

01:26.066 --> 01:30.400
Oh, Ma. Ma, your first day.
You must be really excited.

01:30.467 --> 01:33.500
You bet I'm excited.
This was a great idea of yours.

01:33.567 --> 01:37.233
It's given me a new lease on life.
I need a raise.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.500
Ma, you haven't even started yet.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.867
I meant help me up. These underalls
are choking my pancreas.

01:45.066 --> 01:48.800
I think this will be good for you.
Mr. Porter's a nice man.

01:48.867 --> 01:51.700
-I'm sure you'll have fun.
-Don't forget the money.

01:51.767 --> 01:56.300
I haven't had a paycheck since 1942
and then I blew it all on war bonds.

01:57.300 --> 02:01.667
-At least you got it back.
-No. Italian war bonds.

02:03.367 --> 02:05.900
I fell for their slick
advertising campaign,

02:05.967 --> 02:10.867
"Buy Italian war bonds, the quickest,
surest, fascist way to double your money."

02:12.934 --> 02:14.233
Well, let's go.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.066
You want to make a good impression?
Matching shoes.

02:18.133 --> 02:21.266
-They should match my purse?
-No. They should match each other.

02:26.266 --> 02:28.900
-Hi, Dorothy. Cooking?
-No, Rose.

02:28.967 --> 02:32.200
I'm developing pictures
from the Magellan Space Program.

02:33.734 --> 02:35.633
Yes, I'm cooking.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.633
I was just trying
to make conversation.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.000
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.

02:40.066 --> 02:43.633
Rose, I'm concerned about ma's
first day at Cypress Grove.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.867
Oh, she'll do a fine job.

02:45.934 --> 02:47.233
No, Rose.
You don't understand.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.133
She only thinks that she has a job.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.734
I worked it out with the owner Mr. Porter.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.000
This flu's knocked her for a loop,

02:55.066 --> 02:58.367
and her doctor says
she has to rest for three weeks.

02:58.433 --> 03:03.533
I've been working so much,
this is a way of keeping an eye on her.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.200
Dorothy, that's dishonest.

03:05.266 --> 03:07.600
She wouldn't have done it
if I'd told the truth.

03:07.667 --> 03:12.967
-Oh. You never told a lie?
-That's right. I've never told a lie.

03:13.033 --> 03:16.033
Well, once when I snuck out of class.

03:16.100 --> 03:19.367
-That's not much of a lie.
-That's what I thought.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.166
Turned out to be the day
they taught everything.

03:27.767 --> 03:30.066
The final piece of the puzzle.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.967
Oh, girls, it finally happened.

03:35.033 --> 03:37.967
The most wonderful thing happened
to me at the drug store.

03:38.033 --> 03:42.266
Oh, no. Dr. Scholl was there in person,
and I missed it.

03:44.066 --> 03:46.333
Rose, get new heroes.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.133
I am going to be a model.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.433
There I was sitting at the lunch counter,

03:51.500 --> 03:54.734
and just like Lana Turner,
I was discovered. (laughs)

03:54.800 --> 03:56.900
Well, not exactly like
Miss Lana Turner. (laughs)

03:56.967 --> 03:58.333
She was sipping a soda,

03:58.400 --> 04:01.667
and you were scarfing down
your usual lumberjack breakfast.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.333
(laughs) Oh, Rose.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.934
Silly, silly, water-retaining Rose.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.867
(chuckles)

04:11.934 --> 04:14.100
She was discovered for the movies.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.700
I was discovered
by a print ad photographer,

04:16.767 --> 04:17.967
and the shoot's today.

04:18.033 --> 04:21.734
Oh, Blanche, haven't you had
enough problems with photographers?

04:21.800 --> 04:23.300
Remember the last time?

04:23.367 --> 04:25.133
Sure, the pictures turned out fine,

04:25.200 --> 04:28.200
but it cost your friend
his party's nomination.

04:30.066 --> 04:33.834
Well, I checked this guy out.
He's a pro.

04:33.900 --> 04:39.467
Oh, imagine my face gracing the pages
of Miami's biggest <i>Pennysaver.</i>

04:39.533 --> 04:42.967
Blanche, all this commotion
over a <i>Pennysaver?</i>

04:43.033 --> 04:45.000
I know it isn't exactly <i>Vogue,</i>

04:45.066 --> 04:48.166
but it is delivered
with every daily in Miami.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.800
Oh, girls, what a glorious day.

04:49.867 --> 04:54.233
I just feel so pretty and alive,
and young as a teenager.

04:54.300 --> 04:58.400
Oh, that's terrific. By the way,
you got a call from your grandson.

04:58.467 --> 05:01.367
He got his driver's license!

05:11.166 --> 05:14.166
Ma, look at this place.

05:14.233 --> 05:18.367
-It's lovely.
-Don't get any ideas, pussycat.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.533
I'm not getting any ideas, Ma.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.233
You're scheming.
Remember shady pines, Dorothy?

05:24.300 --> 05:28.100
"Honest, Ma, this is the way
to the new dairy queen."

05:30.400 --> 05:32.133
Ms. Zbornak, right on time.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.633
Mr. Porter, I'd like you to meet
your new activities director,

05:35.700 --> 05:38.066
my mother Sophia Petrillo.

05:38.133 --> 05:39.266
Activities director?

05:39.333 --> 05:42.500
Oh, surely,
you remember the conversation, we...

05:42.567 --> 05:46.800
Do this for me. You promised.
Activities director?

05:46.867 --> 05:50.000
Oh, of course I remember, heh.
Nice meeting you.

05:50.066 --> 05:53.867
I'm sure you'll get along well
with our little gang.

05:53.934 --> 05:56.734
Hi, everybody.
I'm your new activities director.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.000
-What's your name, honey?
-Sophia.

05:59.066 --> 06:01.767
Sophia, move it.
You're blocking the TV.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.500
Tough room, but don't worry.
I'm highly qualified.

06:08.567 --> 06:12.500
By the way, what actually
does an activities director do?

06:12.567 --> 06:16.834
Well, you'll pop in the video rental,
be a fourth for bridge, a buddy.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.934
If you do well, we won't know you
from the other residents.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.600
-I could do that.
-Good, heh. I'll be in my office.

06:23.667 --> 06:27.567
Oh, a couple things you should know.
This is Mr. Lewis.

06:27.633 --> 06:31.467
He's no trouble. He's just quiet.
And, uh, that's smokey.

06:31.533 --> 06:33.967
He fancies himself a ladies' man.

06:34.033 --> 06:37.233
Sort of the rooster
of our little hen house.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.266
Whatever you do,
don't dance with him.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.266
He'll put the moves on anybody.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.600
Smokey, I want you
to meet my daughter.

06:43.667 --> 06:45.033
Ma!

06:48.600 --> 06:49.800
I have to go to work.

06:49.867 --> 06:55.767
I'll say to you what you said to me the
first day you dropped me off at school,

06:55.834 --> 06:59.266
see if you can find someone clean
to drive you home.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.600
(slow music playing)

07:07.667 --> 07:09.266
(birds chirping)

07:09.934 --> 07:12.400
I'm sorry. It just bothers me.

07:12.467 --> 07:15.934
Oh, Ma. Cypress Grove
has a great reputation.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.967
Did you see the story
they did about it on <i>60 Minutes?</i>

07:19.033 --> 07:20.800
No. Short piece.

07:20.867 --> 07:24.033
It was just Mike Wallace saying,
"Sorry I bothered you."

07:25.533 --> 07:26.967
But did you see them?

07:27.033 --> 07:31.333
Some of those people stayed
in front of that TV for 8 straight hours.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.533
Of course,
throw in a bag of cheese corn,

07:33.600 --> 07:36.033
I just described
your Saturday nights.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.233
Ma, Mr. Porter had them resting.

07:41.300 --> 07:44.467
Which is something
you might wanna try.

07:44.533 --> 07:46.567
I don't like this whole deal.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.200
Shady Pines, now, there's a home.

07:49.266 --> 07:51.633
Luxury suites, tennis tournaments.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.800
Wanna massage? Dial 9.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.166
And the food, the filet mignon...

07:57.233 --> 08:00.900
Oh, really, Ma?
Shady Pines had filet mignon.

08:00.967 --> 08:05.100
Oh, one. They'd throw it in the pit
and make us might for it.

08:08.867 --> 08:11.300
(Rose chuckles)

08:11.367 --> 08:14.567
-What's wrong?
-I'll tell you what's wrong.

08:14.633 --> 08:18.867
I took Rose here on my shoot today.
They want to use her hands.

08:18.934 --> 08:22.567
Imagine. They want to use
my face but her hands.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.567
Can you believe it?

08:24.633 --> 08:27.600
This is the most humiliating thing
that's ever happened to me.

08:27.667 --> 08:31.967
How quickly you forget
the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

08:35.767 --> 08:36.934
Big deal.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.433
80,000 people
had to wait 20 minutes.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.734
The torch eventually got there,
didn't it?

08:45.900 --> 08:49.133
Blanche, I'm confused.
So they want to use Rose's hands.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.533
What's the big deal?

08:50.600 --> 08:52.467
Yeah, Blanche. So what?

08:52.533 --> 08:55.400
So life threw the dumb country girl
a crumb for once.

08:55.467 --> 08:58.367
You're sexy and beautiful all the time.

08:58.433 --> 09:03.100
Let's face it. You have Bette Davis eyes
and Freddy Kreuger hands.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.700
(whimpers) I have had it with you.

09:11.767 --> 09:14.333
I'm going to my room,
and I may never come out.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.000
Is it the weekend already?

09:25.467 --> 09:29.200
Afternoon, Dorothy.
My, don't you look lovely today.

09:29.266 --> 09:30.834
Well, thank you.
(chuckles)

09:30.900 --> 09:33.934
Oh, and don't you look beautiful,
vivacious,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.333
exquisite, and, uh...

09:36.734 --> 09:38.734
Uh, let's see.
Breathtaking?

09:38.800 --> 09:41.000
Dorothy, you know at some point,

09:41.066 --> 09:45.266
I'm going to have to start questioning
your sincerity.

09:45.333 --> 09:48.166
When we get to that point,
I'll let you know.

09:49.934 --> 09:51.467
Can you believe it?

09:51.533 --> 09:54.567
I'm beginning to think
Blanche is hung up on her looks.

09:54.633 --> 09:57.900
Boy, you don't need lightning
to strike you.

09:59.500 --> 10:04.667
No, thanks.
Not again. Once was enough.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.400
An extra piece of the puzzle.

10:10.767 --> 10:12.433
I'm the one who should be excited.

10:12.500 --> 10:18.066
Imagine, these hands that once reached
inside a chicken for a breech birth...

10:20.834 --> 10:23.667
...will soon grace the pages
of a <i>Pennysaver.</i>

10:23.734 --> 10:26.433
You've come a long way, baby.

10:27.233 --> 10:28.633
Hello.

10:28.700 --> 10:32.000
Ma. I'm glad you're here.
Mr. Porter called.

10:32.066 --> 10:35.333
He thinks you're pushing
the Cypress Grove folks too hard.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.266
One little
dance-till-you-drop marathon.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.333
It only took 10 minutes.

10:40.734 --> 10:44.400
And what's this about their staying
into the night doing homework?

10:44.467 --> 10:46.767
They sit waiting
for their kids to write,

10:46.834 --> 10:50.600
so I said, "Why don't you write
to our lonely servicemen instead?"

10:50.667 --> 10:53.266
We older folks have to exercise
our minds, too,

10:53.333 --> 10:55.100
and don't you forget it, Gloria.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.734
Ma, Gloria is your daughter
in California.

11:01.133 --> 11:06.667
Uh, I knew that. A mere dramatization
to make my point, uh, pal.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.266
Look, Ma, I know
that you're excited about this job--

11:12.333 --> 11:15.533
it's more than a job, Dorothy.
That's it, Dorothy.

11:18.266 --> 11:21.000
When I see them, I see me.
Understand?

11:21.066 --> 11:22.533
Of course I understand.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.200
I know your heart's in the right place,
but--

11:25.266 --> 11:29.433
No buts. People are being forced
to throw in the towel.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.300
Have you seen what happens
to a person

11:31.367 --> 11:33.367
when their brain's allowed
to disintegrate

11:33.433 --> 11:35.867
and their mind's turned to mush?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.734
Hey. My middle finger's the longest.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.467
I came as soon as I could.
I'm glad you're here.

11:59.533 --> 12:01.166
We've got a problem, your mother.

12:01.233 --> 12:05.367
-What about her?
-She took some of our guests for a walk.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.166
That was six hours ago.

12:08.367 --> 12:09.767
Have you called the police?

12:09.834 --> 12:13.633
Sure. I'll tell them to watch
for old people in Miami. There's a lead.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.867
Hi, pussycat.
What are you doing here?

12:18.934 --> 12:22.266
-Ma, where were you?
-You said you were just taking a walk.

12:22.333 --> 12:26.100
We got halfway down the block,
and Lucille wanted a cappuccino.

12:26.166 --> 12:29.500
The only place I know to get
good cappuccino is Hialeah.

12:29.967 --> 12:33.834
Sophia, this is the final warning.
I don't want this happening again.

12:33.900 --> 12:37.834
You hired me to do a job,
and I'll do it my way.

12:37.900 --> 12:42.500
-Ok. That's it. Charade's over.
-What's he talking about?

12:42.567 --> 12:44.834
Sophia,
you're not the activities director.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.433
You're here because your daughter
wanted us to keep an eye on you,

12:47.500 --> 12:49.667
and we cannot do that anymore.

12:49.734 --> 12:52.734
Ms. Zbornak, don't bring her back.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.633
-Keep an eye on me? Is that true?
-(sighs)

12:55.700 --> 12:58.300
Look, Ma,
I'm not going to lie to you.

12:58.367 --> 13:01.166
This man is a patient here.

13:01.233 --> 13:04.633
He could be dangerous. Let's get out of
here before he starts causing trouble.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.967
-Dorothy.
-Ok. Ok.

13:07.033 --> 13:11.500
I thought you needed looking after
during the day when I wasn't around,

13:11.567 --> 13:14.433
and I knew you wouldn't come here
as a guest.

13:14.500 --> 13:18.734
So you're saying that this activities
director thing was a put-up job?

13:18.800 --> 13:22.033
Mostly his idea. Oh, Ma.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.600
I did it for your own good.

13:24.667 --> 13:28.500
Nobody bothered to consult me
about what was for my own good.

13:28.900 --> 13:32.900
So goodbye, Mr. Porter.
Goodbye, Dorothy.

13:32.967 --> 13:35.800
Thank you both for making me
look like an old fool.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.967
(calm music playing)

13:48.633 --> 13:51.467
-What are you doing?
-I'm recuperating.

13:51.533 --> 13:53.700
You're watching cartoons.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.100
That's what you wanted me to
do at Cypress Grove.

13:56.166 --> 13:59.934
Besides, I like cartoons.
Cartoons don't lie.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Stop it. Can I get you something
from the kitchen?

14:03.066 --> 14:06.500
Tea would be fine.
Tea doesn't lie.

14:06.567 --> 14:08.734
Oh, Ma, come on.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.000
Are you saying you never stretched
the truth with me?

14:12.467 --> 14:14.200
Those were harmless lies.

14:14.266 --> 14:18.667
So all first-grade girls
wear men's shoes? Tsk.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.367
I put bows on them, didn't I?

14:23.700 --> 14:26.834
You do the best you can
with Brown Florsheims.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.700
And this is the thanks you get.

14:30.533 --> 14:35.700
Dorothy, it finally came, the advanced
copy of our <i>Pennysaver</i> ad. (laughs)

14:35.767 --> 14:37.834
Bet my hands are
better-looking than your face.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.967
Bet my face is better-looking
than your hands.

14:40.033 --> 14:43.200
Oh, ladies, ladies.
Can't we settle this with pistols?

14:43.266 --> 14:44.333
(both laughing)

14:44.400 --> 14:47.400
-Come on, open it.
-Ok.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.867
Oh, my God!

14:49.934 --> 14:53.767
-(Dorothy) What's the matter, Blanche?
-Oh, my God!

14:53.834 --> 14:57.233
Oh, come on. No matter what...
Oh, my God!

14:58.033 --> 15:03.033
"Does your face look like this?
Do your hands look like this?

15:03.567 --> 15:08.467
You need
Ponce De Leon anti-aging cream."

15:08.533 --> 15:12.633
(laughing)

15:13.934 --> 15:15.300
I'd sue.

15:16.934 --> 15:20.867
Dorothy Zbornak, how could you?
Oh, look!

15:20.934 --> 15:25.033
They have airbrushed
liver spots all over us! (sobs)

15:25.100 --> 15:26.233
Tell me about it.

15:26.300 --> 15:31.133
You look like you should be barking on
the front seat of a fire engine. (laughs)

15:34.200 --> 15:36.166
I really would sue.

15:40.633 --> 15:44.800
Oh, Rose, sit down.
Listen, I just called the <i>Pennysaver.</i>

15:44.867 --> 15:47.633
I think I have an idea. Ok?

15:47.700 --> 15:49.734
They have six delivery trucks.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.066
By sheer coincidence,
I know two of the drivers.

15:53.467 --> 15:55.166
I'm not worried about them.

15:55.233 --> 15:57.934
They won't show my picture
if I don't show theirs.

16:01.367 --> 16:04.967
Now, as I see it,
of the four remaining drivers

16:05.033 --> 16:07.800
only Agnes is a real problem.

16:07.867 --> 16:12.300
Now, Rose, here's a part
of the plan you may not like.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.867
(Rose) Dorothy, did you and Sophia
patch things up?

16:18.934 --> 16:22.500
Oh, she's in her room napping.
It's so ironic.

16:22.567 --> 16:26.333
I sent her to that home.
There she was vital and happy.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.600
Now she's here, resting,

16:28.667 --> 16:31.834
but she's behaving like
those people at Cypress Grove,

16:31.900 --> 16:34.266
camping in front of the TV all day.

16:34.333 --> 16:38.900
Poor woman. Do you know what
the worst part of getting older is?

16:38.967 --> 16:41.000
Your face? Rose's hands?

16:47.333 --> 16:52.033
(laughs) No. I think
the worst part about getting older

16:52.100 --> 16:54.967
is the overwhelming sense of,
"Where did the time go?"

16:55.033 --> 16:57.767
Was it really that long ago
I was a little girl?

16:57.834 --> 17:01.300
No. Why guess? Lift up your chin,
and we'll count the rings.

17:04.467 --> 17:08.767
I was about to share with you
a significant memory from my youth.

17:08.834 --> 17:12.066
It was the evening
my mother gave birth to Clayton.

17:12.133 --> 17:14.400
In the spirit of the happy occasion,

17:14.467 --> 17:16.867
big daddy and his cronies tied one on

17:16.934 --> 17:20.567
and caroused through Atlanta's streets,
heh, looking for some trouble.

17:20.633 --> 17:24.533
Just then, as luck would have it,
who rounded the corner

17:24.600 --> 17:27.266
but two smart-mouthed
New York lawyers.

17:27.967 --> 17:32.333
So one thing led to another,
and, well, big daddy and his friends

17:32.400 --> 17:36.667
ended up sort of skimming them
across higgins' pond.

17:36.734 --> 17:41.133
It was all in good fun,
at least that was their defense.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.734
Anyway, that was the night
prohibition started.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.400
Blanche, prohibition started
in the twenties.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.734
Oh, I meant probation.
Big daddy went on probation.

17:52.834 --> 17:57.500
And the point of this sordid
song of the south?

17:57.567 --> 18:01.934
Just that sometimes a daughter
has to look after her own parent,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.266
as unnatural as that may feel.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.867
Well, it wasn't unnatural in St. Olaf.

18:07.934 --> 18:11.567
We not only took care of our old people,
we revered them,

18:11.633 --> 18:14.300
honored them, put them on a pedestal.

18:14.367 --> 18:18.033
Of course, that's how we got to be
the broken hip capital of the Midwest.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.800
That's a beautiful story, Rose.

18:24.834 --> 18:28.800
Very inspirational. Now we have to stop
those <i>Pennysavers.</i>

18:28.867 --> 18:33.066
Let's go see if we can get your hair
greased back and find you a flannel shirt.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.333
(all laughing)

18:41.400 --> 18:46.133
Oh, great, great party, Sophia,
but where's the junk food?

18:46.200 --> 18:49.266
I've got a great idea for free pizza.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.667
Let's call up that
30-minute pizza place

18:51.734 --> 18:54.033
and tell them we're college kids.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.900
When the guy gets here,
one of us grandmas will open the door

18:56.967 --> 18:59.433
and say,
"What took you so long?"

18:59.500 --> 19:01.066
(all laughing)

19:01.133 --> 19:04.100
Oh, it's great to have you back,
Sophia.

19:04.166 --> 19:06.233
It's good to be back.

19:06.300 --> 19:09.333
I was getting tired of
feeling sorry for myself.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.567
They may not have wanted
an activities director, but they got one.

19:13.633 --> 19:16.266
So, what do you say?
Let's get active!

19:17.734 --> 19:19.700
(party music playing)

19:19.767 --> 19:22.000
Hey, Mr. Lewis,
would you like to dance?

19:23.667 --> 19:25.633
Oh, I can see you've had lessons.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.567
Hey, everybody. It's 10:00.

19:29.633 --> 19:33.300
-Do you care where your children are?
-No! No! No!

19:35.700 --> 19:38.900
(calm music playing)

19:43.233 --> 19:45.600
Where have you been?

19:45.667 --> 19:50.000
My plan with the truck drivers didn't work
thanks to little Miss Straight-laced here.

19:50.700 --> 19:53.934
So I've been in every yard
in a six-block radius

19:54.000 --> 19:56.166
getting these <i>Pennysavers</i>
from the paperboys.

19:56.233 --> 19:58.333
She was a woman possessed.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.333
Caught some on the fly,
scaled roofs,

20:01.400 --> 20:04.433
and she had a brilliant idea
for avoiding guard dogs.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.233
You made her wear lamb chops again,
didn't you?

20:07.700 --> 20:11.233
It's not like they slow her down.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.567
-Have you seen my mother?
-No. No.

20:13.633 --> 20:17.367
I can't find her. She's gone.
She's not in her bedroom.

20:17.433 --> 20:21.533
That's it! She never does
what I tell her to do.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.967
A dunce could guess where she is.

20:24.033 --> 20:27.700
I know, I know.
Wait a minute.

20:27.767 --> 20:32.166
It's true on both hands.
Look.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.500
<i>♪ You put your right foot in ♪</i>

20:36.567 --> 20:38.433
Come on, get them in.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.734
<i>♪ You take your right foot out ♪</i>

20:41.800 --> 20:43.734
Let's go, let's go.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.333
<i>♪ You put your right foot in and... ♪</i>

20:46.400 --> 20:48.300
Hurry up,
or we'll never get to the part

20:48.367 --> 20:50.834
where you shake it all
about on purpose.

20:51.633 --> 20:54.500
Oh, God, they got into the medication.

20:54.967 --> 20:56.800
Ma, what do you think you're doing?

20:56.867 --> 20:58.233
Oh, look who's here.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.600
Everybody remembers
my daughter Dorothy,

21:00.667 --> 21:03.967
or maybe you know her by her Indian name,
dances with nobody.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.166
Ma, come home.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.066
When I'm good and ready.

21:10.133 --> 21:12.967
You have been sick,
and I know what's best for you.

21:13.033 --> 21:15.834
Nothing's going to stop me
from taking you home.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.834
I should've known it was you.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.867
I can handle her.

21:19.934 --> 21:21.533
Not so far.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.633
Maybe I can handle her.
Who's the problem?

21:23.700 --> 21:27.300
-You.
-Perfect. I know my every move.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.133
Look, these people are up way too late.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.900
This party's over!
Everybody back to bed!

21:31.967 --> 21:36.200
I danced tonight.
First time in 25 years.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.266
You can speak.
How come you haven't spoken before?

21:40.333 --> 21:43.700
No one was listening,
not until you got here.

21:43.767 --> 21:45.667
I've been
here. Could've spoken to me.

21:45.734 --> 21:47.400
I don't like you.

21:48.934 --> 21:52.667
Don't you see, Mr. Porter?
You're not listening to these people.

21:52.734 --> 21:56.500
You're only as old as you feel.
You're making them feel old.

21:56.567 --> 22:00.867
Pussycat, you make me feel old,
like I can't make my own choices.

22:00.934 --> 22:03.300
I worry about you.

22:03.367 --> 22:05.300
And everything I did here...

22:05.367 --> 22:08.900
Well, Ma, it's because...

22:08.967 --> 22:11.133
I'm afraid of losing you.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.033
I understand that,
but, pussycat, give me air.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.867
I know you love me,

22:15.934 --> 22:19.300
but maybe we can make decisions
about me together.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.433
Yes, Ma. We will.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.867
(chuckles)

22:30.934 --> 22:34.400
(theme music playing)
