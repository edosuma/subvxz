WEBVTT

00:02.077 --> 00:04.788
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...
- I'm making a buy.

00:04.872 --> 00:08.083
You come back with five figures,
and we'll do business.

00:08.167 --> 00:10.169
Any chance I could borrow $10,000?

00:10.211 --> 00:12.171
I know an accountant/councilman

00:12.254 --> 00:14.465
with access to a civic investment portfolio...

00:14.590 --> 00:15.633
Make it $50,000.

00:16.425 --> 00:18.344
Summer reading from Internal Affairs.

00:18.427 --> 00:23.015
It appears Pete was the brains behind
the skimming, extortion, wiretapping.

00:23.098 --> 00:26.602
Good thing for us he turned up
the way he did and we don't have to get honest.

00:26.685 --> 00:29.772
- How's Tim doing?
- How do you think? His father's dead.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.273
Are you free for dinner?

00:31.357 --> 00:33.400
- Who's your friend?
- Peter's ex-wife.

00:33.484 --> 00:34.902
Are you fucking insane?

00:34.985 --> 00:37.488
- I thought Dean was out of your life.
- He was.

00:37.571 --> 00:41.450
<i>- Until the handitard drove off of a cliff.
- Is he going to be OK?</i>

00:41.534 --> 00:44.328
The initial surgery was successful
but he'll need more.

00:44.411 --> 00:46.497
We are getting a divorce.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.833
- There's no one else but you.
- Oh, God.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.545
Sanjay, your territories are junior colleges...

00:52.628 --> 00:54.797
And gay bars and dance clubs.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.007
Tara's completely active in the Church.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.885
The Lord wants me to sell pot, Mrs Botwin.

00:59.969 --> 01:02.388
- Fine, you're in.
- Do I get a cell phone, too?

01:02.471 --> 01:05.432
- Yeah. Take Silas'.
- I'd like my phone back.

01:05.516 --> 01:07.935
I have other plans for you.
Teach him to grow.

01:08.018 --> 01:12.106
All right, Nancy. You want your boy
to be my bitch? He'll be my bitch.

01:12.189 --> 01:16.277
What we need is to redirect a small portion
of our sewage through your town.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.320
Shit highway could be our road to riches.

01:18.404 --> 01:21.031
- We need these votes.
- I'm thinking a golf membership.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.284
- Your membership's been revoked.
- What?

01:23.409 --> 01:25.286
God bless the new Majestic!

01:25.369 --> 01:28.163
- Holy shit!
- That's a lot of sewage.

01:28.247 --> 01:31.041
That motherfucker.
I'm gonna have him killed.

01:36.088 --> 01:39.091
<i>Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:39.174 --> 01:41.719
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:41.802 --> 01:45.139
<i># Little boxes, little boxes</i>

01:45.222 --> 01:48.183
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:48.267 --> 01:51.270
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:51.353 --> 01:54.231
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:54.315 --> 01:57.651
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:57.735 --> 02:00.362
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

02:01.864 --> 02:04.867
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

02:04.950 --> 02:07.995
<i># All go to the university</i>

02:08.078 --> 02:11.039
<i># And they all get put in boxes</i>

02:11.123 --> 02:14.043

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

From the boys at Sigma Alpha Delta.

02:34.647 --> 02:36.232
Thank you, Sanjay.

02:36.315 --> 02:38.192
You may have another.

02:43.572 --> 02:47.284
- The youth pastor is a wake-and-baker.
- Holy smokes.

02:49.453 --> 02:50.538
Thank you.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.254
- Why is this all wet?
- Water park.

03:10.432 --> 03:11.892
That's $20,000.

03:12.101 --> 03:15.271
The way things are going,
I'll have the rest in a few days.

03:15.354 --> 03:17.481
- Why is this stack wet?
- Water park.

03:18.691 --> 03:22.444
All the money goes back
into the Agrestic account. No trails back to us.

03:22.528 --> 03:26.699
There's no more Agrestic, Nance.
No town. We're good.

03:26.782 --> 03:28.701
- Let's keep it.
- Doug.

03:29.702 --> 03:33.247
I might be a drug dealer,
but I'm no embezzler.

03:33.330 --> 03:36.333
Oh, no, we'll put it back. Eventually.

03:36.417 --> 03:41.005
Until they figure out which way is up,
we could use this capital to our advantage.

03:41.755 --> 03:45.009
Yeah. I'm not comfortable with this.

03:45.092 --> 03:48.387
Well, get comfortable.
Buy more drugs, sell more drugs.

03:48.470 --> 03:50.973
And then when we're crazy rich,
we can pay back Agrestic

03:51.056 --> 03:53.267
and buy corn dogs for all of Darfur.

03:53.350 --> 03:57.271
I'm not sure corn dogs are first up
on the wish list in Darfur.

03:57.354 --> 04:00.608
My point is, we need this capital
if we're gonna be the Weed-Mart

04:00.691 --> 04:02.484
of the San Fernando Valley.

04:02.568 --> 04:06.864
Homegrown Depot. Potco.
You need to trust me on this, Nancy.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.075
- I don't tell you how to move a brick.
- Fine.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.494
For now.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.122
Listen, Doug, a word of advice.

04:15.206 --> 04:17.541
Watch your back. Sullivan's on the warpath.

04:17.583 --> 04:18.959
I didn't do anything.

04:19.043 --> 04:22.296
So you had nothing to do
with that pipe exploding?

04:22.379 --> 04:26.800
- That was clearly an act of God.
- Well, tell God to watch his back.

04:26.926 --> 04:29.178
Nancy, don't anthropomorphise God.

04:30.429 --> 04:32.598
That sounds like fun.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.352
Tim and Shane together?

04:36.435 --> 04:41.065
We could give it a shot.
Yeah, I know where that is. Great.

04:41.148 --> 04:44.610
Terrific. All right.
We'll see you there. Bye, Val.

04:46.528 --> 04:48.572
You got a call.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.742
- From who?
- Roy Till.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.286
- I don't know Roy Till.
- Roy Till knew you.

04:54.370 --> 04:56.580
And what did Roy Till want?

04:56.664 --> 05:01.544
- I asked Roy Till that very question.
- Why are you making me work so hard for this?

05:01.627 --> 05:04.463
Because Captain Roy Till is with the DEA,

05:04.547 --> 05:07.675
because he wants you to come down
to his office as soon as possible,

05:07.758 --> 05:11.387
because he said you've probably
been expecting this call.

05:16.976 --> 05:18.602
That was my reaction.

05:18.686 --> 05:22.022
"The side effects may be urinary incontinence,

05:22.106 --> 05:24.525
migraine, fuzzy vision, rapid heartbeat,

05:24.608 --> 05:29.488
swollen limbs, depression, mania,
nocturnal psychosis, erectile dysfunction...

05:29.530 --> 05:31.073
Wake up.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.492
- Wake up.
- It's not a dream.

05:33.576 --> 05:34.952
Here's his feeding schedule.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.913
And the physical therapy exercises
are in the binder.

05:37.997 --> 05:43.043
- And you're gonna have to change his diaper.
- Stop speaking.

05:43.127 --> 05:45.546
Fine. Figure it out yourself.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.092
I have no memory of giving birth to you.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.886
None whatsoever.

05:53.637 --> 05:55.514
Oh!

05:55.598 --> 05:57.975
Oh...

05:58.058 --> 06:01.020
There is no God.

06:01.103 --> 06:04.815
You have to change my diaper
so I don't get a rash.

06:07.610 --> 06:08.944
Not gonna happen.

06:09.028 --> 06:11.363
I stood by you when you had cancer.

06:11.447 --> 06:15.326
Yeah, my cancer didn't stink.

06:16.911 --> 06:19.914
Celia, if I get a rash, it could get infected,

06:19.997 --> 06:23.167
and my body can't fight off infection right now.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.794
Will you die?

06:25.836 --> 06:27.713
Worse.

06:27.796 --> 06:33.177
I'll have to have a lot more surgeries and
you'll have to take care of me for a lot longer.

06:33.928 --> 06:36.263
This is not right.

06:36.347 --> 06:39.516
After we change me,
we should do some exercises.

06:40.809 --> 06:43.312
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

06:43.896 --> 06:45.856
Seeing me miserable.

06:45.940 --> 06:50.069
It's the only silver lining on a very dark cloud.

06:59.161 --> 07:01.205
I'm looking for Roy Till.

07:01.872 --> 07:03.415
Nancy Botwin.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.337
- Am I in the right place?
- Captain Till's been waiting for you.

07:14.927 --> 07:17.805
- That's her.
- Hey, is that her?

07:20.766 --> 07:23.727
- Check it out.
- Hey, isn't that Pete's wife?

07:26.981 --> 07:28.816
I have questions.

07:30.776 --> 07:32.820
- You do?
- Sit.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.746
I see you don't use the name Scottson.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.832
Er, no.

07:45.583 --> 07:48.002
Kids. Kids are Botwin.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.671
Keeping it consistent.

07:50.754 --> 07:54.008
You and Pete kept your marriage awful quiet.

07:55.134 --> 07:58.095
- Yes, yes.
- Why?

07:59.471 --> 08:00.806
Do I need a lawyer?

08:00.890 --> 08:05.060
Frankly, I'm a little surprised
you didn't come clean to us about this sooner.

08:06.770 --> 08:08.397
- Why's that?
- So you could get

08:08.480 --> 08:10.733
what you have coming to you.

08:12.234 --> 08:15.029
Why don't we settle all this right now?

08:17.656 --> 08:19.617
And "all this" would be?

08:19.700 --> 08:22.578
Life insurance cheque,
made out to Nancy Scottson.

08:22.661 --> 08:24.288
Shouldn't be any trouble to cash

08:24.371 --> 08:26.832
if you show the bank
a copy of the marriage licence.

08:26.916 --> 08:28.167
Also, forms to fill out,

08:28.250 --> 08:31.837
so we can start sending you
his pension cheques.

08:33.839 --> 08:35.591
Oh.

08:35.674 --> 08:39.094
- Look at that.
- Things from Pete's desk.

08:41.429 --> 08:43.890
That should close the book on all this.

08:43.974 --> 08:46.644
Er, again, "all this"?

08:47.811 --> 08:50.731
We don't know what Pete told you
and what he didn't.

08:50.814 --> 08:52.399
Frankly, we don't care.

08:52.483 --> 08:54.902
What he was involved with when he died,

08:54.985 --> 08:58.239
who he was involved with,
it's all in the past.

08:58.322 --> 09:02.326
We'd rather think the best of him.
I'm sure you would, too.

09:02.409 --> 09:06.497
- The best.
- But should it not remain in the past,

09:07.206 --> 09:10.876
well, that would seriously affect his pension.

09:12.169 --> 09:14.547
Do you understand what I'm saying?

09:14.630 --> 09:17.258
Yes. Completely, totally.

09:17.341 --> 09:19.927
- That's all, Mrs Scottson.
- Botwin.

09:20.219 --> 09:21.971
Mrs Botwin.

09:32.982 --> 09:34.608
God bless you.

09:39.655 --> 09:41.282
My condolences.

09:43.742 --> 09:46.245
You are the sun. You control it all.

09:46.328 --> 09:48.664
If you don't keep a light schedule,
seeds sprout

09:48.747 --> 09:50.791
and reach for any source of light they find.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.752
Not too different from humans,
but that's another lecture.

09:53.836 --> 09:56.380
Point is, you didn't put the grow light on a timer,

09:56.463 --> 09:59.967
so these went toward my light,
made them spindly.

10:00.843 --> 10:03.929
These seeds were your responsibility.
You fucked 'em up.

10:04.013 --> 10:05.222
Sorry.

10:08.267 --> 10:11.312
- Things OK at home?
- Are they ever?

10:12.062 --> 10:13.355
Mom OK?

10:14.398 --> 10:16.609
She's a tough read.

10:17.526 --> 10:19.111
Yeah, I know.

10:23.741 --> 10:26.076
And what happened here?

10:26.160 --> 10:28.871
Brown spots, yellowing, moving upward.

10:30.164 --> 10:31.415
Think.

10:33.209 --> 10:36.128
- Nitrogen deficiency?
- And what do you do?

10:36.503 --> 10:39.215
Add a solution with a high N rating,

10:39.298 --> 10:42.051
like Advanced Nutrients' Connoisseur?

10:42.134 --> 10:44.136
- That's right.
- Ha!

10:44.220 --> 10:46.722
Ha, my ass, you plant killing motherfucker.

10:46.805 --> 10:49.433
You should have got it right the first time.
Pay attention.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.436
No one is going to take care of you in life, Silas.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.521
Learn and grow.

10:54.605 --> 10:55.731
Move!

10:56.732 --> 11:00.027
Save those plants!
That's money out of my pocket!

11:00.694 --> 11:02.780
Oh, shit, that reminds me.

11:07.076 --> 11:10.579
It's from my mom.
She wants more stuff.

11:10.663 --> 11:13.624
Yo, it just slipped your mind
that there's thousands of dollars

11:13.707 --> 11:15.751
in your fucking backpack? Jesus.

11:15.834 --> 11:18.462
Oh, damn. I also forgot
there's a diamond up my ass.

11:18.546 --> 11:20.214
- You want it?
- You know what?

11:20.297 --> 11:23.551
Take care of my plants
before you find a foot up there.

11:23.634 --> 11:26.303
- Tell your mom I said hi.
- Yeah.

11:26.929 --> 11:29.515
Hey. Tell her, all right?

11:30.975 --> 11:32.226
Sure.

11:34.228 --> 11:35.813
Let me get this straight.

11:35.896 --> 11:39.275
You say we're going to the Apple Store,
but instead, you bring me here

11:39.358 --> 11:41.485
and force me to play
with Peter's asshole son

11:41.569 --> 11:44.280
so you can hang out with his ex-wife?

11:44.363 --> 11:46.323
Do I have this right?

11:46.407 --> 11:50.494
- Er, yeah.
- So not cool.

11:50.578 --> 11:52.329
I'm not proud.

11:52.413 --> 11:54.081
You owe me.

11:54.164 --> 11:55.833
It might be fun.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.503
Fine. Debt owed. Let's go.

12:03.007 --> 12:06.260
- You think that's funny, dickbag?
- That's not even a word, dildock.

12:06.343 --> 12:09.972
- I'm not sure this was such a good idea.
- They'll be fine.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.184
Er, blue raspberry or cherry?

12:14.268 --> 12:15.686
- Cherry.
- Wait a minute.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.605
Think you owe me some money.

12:17.688 --> 12:19.315
Oh, how much?

12:19.398 --> 12:22.234
$119,000.

12:24.695 --> 12:27.281
- I was gonna tell you.
- You married him?

12:28.240 --> 12:31.285
Married. Did that just slip your mind?

12:31.368 --> 12:34.663
- How do you fit that into a conversation?
- "Guess what, Val?

12:34.747 --> 12:38.042
"Before you go down to the DEA's office
and make an ass of yourself,

12:38.083 --> 12:40.002
"let me tell you Peter and I were married. "

12:40.127 --> 12:43.547
- There. Pretty simple.
- It was a drunken weekend.

12:43.631 --> 12:48.344
Completely stupid,
only-on-nine-cosmos kind of thing.

12:48.469 --> 12:50.262
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

12:50.346 --> 12:52.431
Well, then, how about the fucking money?

12:52.514 --> 12:54.558
I didn't even know I was getting any money.

12:54.642 --> 12:58.354
Yeah, well, you got it. So give it to me.
That's Tim's money.

12:58.437 --> 13:01.732
I don't want the money.
I'm giving you the money.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.651
Look. Here. Take it.

13:06.278 --> 13:08.113
Just putt, asshole.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.116
It's made out to you.

13:12.451 --> 13:13.619
I'll endorse it over.

13:13.702 --> 13:18.082
You can't endorse a $119,000 cheque.
I'm not stupid.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.000
Let's go to the bank.

13:20.084 --> 13:22.253
It's Sunday. Banks are closed.

13:22.336 --> 13:24.630
Then we'll deposit it tomorrow.

13:24.713 --> 13:28.467
I'll transfer it over,
and you can declare it a gift.

13:28.551 --> 13:30.052
It's not a gift.

13:30.177 --> 13:34.014
I lived with that asshole for 11 years.
I earned that.

13:34.098 --> 13:37.142
OK. Bad choice of words.
It's your money.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.895
Give me a break already.

13:43.232 --> 13:46.235
- You were gonna tell me?
- Sure, eventually.

13:46.527 --> 13:48.362
Putt now or die!

13:53.033 --> 13:55.744
- Yes! Hole-in-one.
- Your son is annoying.

13:55.828 --> 13:58.205
Oh, glass-house-dwelling person.

13:58.330 --> 14:01.166
You're right. I'm putting down the stone.

14:04.587 --> 14:07.172
- You want the Slushie now?
- That's OK.

14:07.256 --> 14:12.344
Come on. The ugly, confronty part of the day
is over. We're free to have treats now.

14:13.304 --> 14:15.681
Why did you have to assume the worst?

14:15.764 --> 14:17.391
I'm used to getting fucked.

14:17.474 --> 14:20.644
Oh, get over it.
Neither of us is getting fucked.

14:21.270 --> 14:22.563
Poor us.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.815
No shit.

14:38.662 --> 14:40.039
Jeez, you ever hear of a phone?

14:40.122 --> 14:42.666
Dana took the charger. I need $100,000.

14:42.750 --> 14:45.502
Majestic is checking the books tomorrow.

14:46.003 --> 14:48.088
I bought 10 more bricks.

14:48.172 --> 14:50.966
"Putting it back in the business"?
You remember?

14:51.050 --> 14:53.093
Oh, God. Me in prison.

14:53.177 --> 14:55.179
I'm way too long for those beds.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.556
And the food. There is no sushi in prison.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.267
- Unless you count dick.
- OK, listen.

15:03.520 --> 15:08.192
Why do you need $100,000
if we only took $50,000 for the initial buy?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.736
- Did we take more than $50,000?
- We took $50,000.

15:10.819 --> 15:12.780
It was only a matter of time
before we doubled up

15:12.863 --> 15:16.158
so I took another $50,000 for my divorce
lawyer and got laser eye surgery.

15:16.242 --> 15:17.868
Recovered in a day. Fucking miracle.

15:17.952 --> 15:21.121
Now I can read the tiny print
they use for warning labels on pills.

15:21.205 --> 15:24.333
Big pharma fucks us coming and going,
Nance, and I'm going to prison.

15:24.416 --> 15:28.045
I'm going to prison, while big pharma
roams free. There is no justice.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.631
Are you on some big pharma right now?

15:30.714 --> 15:34.510
If I go to jail, will you come with me?
I cannot do it alone.

15:34.593 --> 15:40.224
Oh, you're not gonna go to jail, Doug.
I might have access to some money.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.894
Have you been hoarding money
from your accountant? That is not cool.

15:43.978 --> 15:47.022
Doug, go upstairs, take a bath.

15:47.106 --> 15:49.775
I suggest you try the bath bomb.

15:49.900 --> 15:54.363
The carbonation's delightful. All right?
We'll figure this out.

15:54.405 --> 15:58.826
- She never lets me use the tub, lucky.
- I'm going to jail.

15:58.909 --> 16:01.245
You're not going to jail, Doug.

16:01.954 --> 16:05.541
I'm gonna have all kinds of cock
shoved up my ass.

16:05.583 --> 16:08.127
I need to say something out loud.

16:10.629 --> 16:12.256
I killed Peter.

16:16.677 --> 16:18.554
Did you hear what I said?

16:18.637 --> 16:20.639
Yeah, I heard you. You killed Peter.

16:24.935 --> 16:27.938
We all knew that U-Turn story was bullshit.

16:29.648 --> 16:32.151
I guessed poison. Was I right?

16:33.277 --> 16:36.363
Silas thought you smothered him in his sleep.

16:36.447 --> 16:40.034
Shane had some wild theory
about you and a samurai.

16:40.117 --> 16:43.245
My whole family thinks I'm a killer.

16:43.329 --> 16:47.833
- You just said you killed him.
- I didn't actually kill him or have him killed.

16:47.917 --> 16:50.711
I'm saying that if he never met me,
he'd still be alive.

16:50.794 --> 16:52.796
Listen,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.799
I taught Stephanie Cooper
how to give head.

16:56.967 --> 17:00.512
She died when a guy she was blowing

17:00.596 --> 17:03.766
drove into a swamp.
Doesn't mean I killed her.

17:04.058 --> 17:06.602
It means I was a great teacher.

17:06.685 --> 17:09.313
And he was a bad driver.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.272
And the alligators were hungry.

17:11.357 --> 17:14.777
I got Peter's life insurance and pension money.

17:14.859 --> 17:17.195
- Jackpot.
- No.

17:17.279 --> 17:19.990
I promised it to Valerie and to Doug.

17:21.659 --> 17:23.993
I don't know what to do.

17:24.078 --> 17:28.374
If I don't give it to Doug, he goes to jail.
If I don't give it to Valerie, I go to hell.

17:28.457 --> 17:30.459
Jail comes before hell.

17:31.877 --> 17:34.255
Or you could give it all to me.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.427
Sullivan.

17:40.511 --> 17:43.514
I'm not Sullivan. I'm the Easter Bunny.

17:45.099 --> 17:46.976
You want your basket?

17:49.395 --> 17:53.857
Just wait, wait, wait a minute. Just a sec.
I want to freshen up.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.610
Collect my eggs.

18:03.534 --> 18:06.787
- Celia?
- You make any noise,

18:06.871 --> 18:10.165
so help me God,
you will be sitting in that diaper

18:12.751 --> 18:14.378
for a week.

18:24.513 --> 18:26.765
Oh.

18:26.849 --> 18:28.893
Mmm.

18:32.104 --> 18:35.774
I'm so impressed by you. Your kindness.

18:35.858 --> 18:40.696
Dropping everything to take care of a man
you don't love,

18:40.779 --> 18:42.990
because he has no one else.

18:46.118 --> 18:49.121
- You are the most selfless woman.
- I am.

18:49.747 --> 18:52.208
- I'm wonderful.
- Yes.

18:52.291 --> 18:53.292
- You are.
- No.

18:55.085 --> 18:57.546
- Let's go to the bedroom.
- No.

18:59.465 --> 19:01.634
OK, fine. Fuck it.

19:02.676 --> 19:04.929
Mm.

19:05.012 --> 19:07.556
- What is that?
- It's a dog.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.891
- Dryer.
- Woof!

19:09.975 --> 19:11.727
OK, it's him.

19:11.810 --> 19:13.479
- Come on.
- He's in there?

19:13.562 --> 19:16.482
He's safer there. Can't hurt himself.

19:16.565 --> 19:18.943
- Woof!
- Wait, where you going?

19:21.028 --> 19:22.029
Woof!

19:22.738 --> 19:23.989
Jesus.

19:26.325 --> 19:29.453
Maybe we ought to take a little break, huh?

19:29.537 --> 19:30.579
I'll call you.

19:32.915 --> 19:36.126
Thanks for that, Celia.
Doggy got a big bone.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.177
Little close there, kiddo!

19:45.261 --> 19:46.262
Over here!

19:46.345 --> 19:48.889
- Still hating me.
- He's very committed.

19:53.978 --> 19:56.605
- What's this?
- That? That is cash.

19:56.689 --> 19:59.066
It's not $119,000 in cash.

19:59.108 --> 20:03.279
- It's $4,500.
- Where's my money?

20:03.362 --> 20:06.532
I have the money. I just don't have it here.
This is a down payment.

20:06.615 --> 20:07.616
I knew it.

20:08.868 --> 20:11.912
I had a little emergency.
You're gonna have it back in a month.

20:11.996 --> 20:13.664
This is a scam, right?

20:13.747 --> 20:16.792
You don't understand.
There's money coming in.

20:17.501 --> 20:19.795
- No worries.
- No worries?

20:19.879 --> 20:21.463
I have cards maxed out.

20:21.547 --> 20:25.259
I have creditors calling me.
I can't make my rent.

20:25.342 --> 20:28.304
I can't wait for money to come in.
I need it now.

20:28.387 --> 20:30.264
Jesus. Why are you in such bad shape?

20:30.389 --> 20:32.641
I've spent all my cash on coke and man whores.

20:32.725 --> 20:36.520
Why the hell do you think? I work
a middle-class job in the Bush economy.

20:36.645 --> 20:40.065
- Where's my fucking money?
- It's fucking coming!

20:40.149 --> 20:42.526
You spent it already, didn't you?

20:43.068 --> 20:45.112
That was my money.

20:46.238 --> 20:47.531
Fucked.

20:49.283 --> 20:50.910
Fucked, fucked.

20:52.703 --> 20:54.163
Not fucked.

20:54.538 --> 20:56.790
Just fucked in the head.

20:57.958 --> 21:02.046
Clearly not ready to listen,
so I'm gonna go.

21:04.715 --> 21:06.217
I'll call you.

21:11.347 --> 21:15.893
- Mom, she took my ball!
- Fuck your ball. She took our 100 grand.

21:17.686 --> 21:20.522
First of all, Mr Wilson,
we would like to thank you for the T-shirts

21:20.606 --> 21:25.110
that you brought us from the 2001
Agrestic 5K Thanksgiving Fun Run.

21:25.194 --> 21:27.988
I drew that logo.
The turkey with the sneakers.

21:29.031 --> 21:31.033
That's quite a talent, Mr Wilson.

21:31.116 --> 21:34.119
However, we're here to discuss
Agrestic's financial records,

21:34.203 --> 21:36.789
- not funny T-shirts.
- Of course, Ann.

21:36.956 --> 21:40.125
May I call you Ann? I'm getting divorced.

21:40.251 --> 21:43.546
There seems to be
an outstanding loan here, Councilman Doug,

21:43.629 --> 21:46.131
made to a company called Aguatecture?

21:46.215 --> 21:48.801
Yes. Yes, there is.
And I have the repayment of that loan

21:48.884 --> 21:51.178
right here in my back pocket.

21:55.641 --> 21:57.935
- This is a post-dated personal check.
- Yes.

21:57.977 --> 22:01.063
- This is all highly unorthodox, Mr Wilson.
- Yes.

22:01.146 --> 22:04.191
You're claiming this is repayment
on the loan made to Aguatecture.

22:04.275 --> 22:06.569
Yes. You see the memo line right there?

22:06.652 --> 22:09.113
It says, "For Aguatecture. "
It's a great little business.

22:09.196 --> 22:13.576
A socially responsible, minority-owned company
that makes fountains shaped like houses.

22:13.659 --> 22:18.289
Victorians, Tudors, even castles.
Heart-warming story.

22:18.372 --> 22:22.960
Hardscrabble, good people,
invested with our hearts, and it paid off.

22:23.043 --> 22:25.212
They're selling like bratwurst in Germany.

22:25.296 --> 22:28.465
Praise the Lord.
Hallelujah, with the grace of the God.

22:28.549 --> 22:31.552
So be it, amen. Hm-mm. Oh, brother.

22:31.635 --> 22:33.262
- Amen.
- Amen.

22:33.345 --> 22:37.433
My wife's a fountain freak.
She'd love those.

22:37.516 --> 22:39.310
Yeah, where can I get one?

22:39.393 --> 22:42.605
I'll hook you all up.
Fountains for everyone. At cost!

22:42.688 --> 22:44.148
Thank you!

22:52.239 --> 22:54.074
Crust, please.

23:31.862 --> 23:33.280
Thank you.

23:48.963 --> 23:51.507
- Where the fuck have you been?
- I quit.

23:51.632 --> 23:52.883
Bullshit.

23:54.426 --> 23:56.053
Not bullshit.

23:56.762 --> 24:00.015
- Look at how you treat me.
- How I treat you?

24:00.099 --> 24:01.517
I haven't had lunch.

24:01.600 --> 24:05.354
I left three messages
saying I wanted soup and a Cobb salad.

24:05.437 --> 24:07.273
So, fire me instead.

24:09.066 --> 24:11.193
But I like you.

24:11.277 --> 24:15.906
You're a shitty assistant, but your skin's like milk,
and you're almost as smart as I am.

24:15.990 --> 24:18.242
If you make this easy for me,

24:18.951 --> 24:21.287
let me steal all the office supplies I want,

24:21.370 --> 24:24.206
we can do it on the table before I go.

24:24.290 --> 24:26.333
You would have been a killer in business

24:26.417 --> 24:28.961
if you hadn't pissed away your potential
on the mommy track.

24:29.044 --> 24:31.755
Yeah. I guess it wasn't meant to be.

24:33.632 --> 24:35.384
Look at you, anal.

24:35.718 --> 24:40.097
Shouldn't you just sweep everything off
and ravage me like a real man?

24:40.222 --> 24:43.142
I spent the whole day organising this shit.

24:48.063 --> 24:51.150
- Bitch.
- Oh, yeah. I'm bad. Punish me.

25:05.873 --> 25:08.250
