24:48.641 --> 24:50.609
Okay, interesting.
Continue.

24:50.676 --> 24:53.804
He is probably in Drama

41:56.768 --> 41:58.133

I think yöu should stay away
from racing for a while.

42:00.205 --> 42:02.139

would be a jerk about this.

42:02.207 --> 42:03.731

good.

Unlike most girls?

43:41.106 --> 43:43.267
Hey, yöu said that, not me.

43:43.341 --> 43:45.468
It was the car l
learned to drive in.

43:46.378 --> 43:48.846
Mine was an old Honda Civic.

43:48.913 --> 43:50.312
It was my dad's.

43:50.382 --> 43:53.749
The day he brought it home,
he was like a little kid.

43:53.818 --> 43:55.979
He had been saving up
for years to buy it.

43:56.054 --> 43:58.488
My mom was so mad.

43:58.556 --> 44:02.151
She called it his
convertible midlife crisis.

44:03.328 --> 44:06.559
I still remember the feel of
the leather when it was new,

44:06.631 --> 44:08.258
and the smell.

44:08.333 --> 44:11.632
He used to say Porche leather
had a unique scent to it.

44:11.703 --> 44:16.072
And, I don't want that to fade
so I only drive it on special

44:16.141 --> 44:19.872
occasions, or...
when I have a lot on my mind.

44:21.980 --> 44:24.039
How long has he been gone for?

44:26.751 --> 44:28.514
Three years.

44:33.725 --> 44:34.919
I'm sorry.

44:34.993 --> 44:36.551
Why?

44:40.064 --> 44:42.862
So, I heard a rumor
yöur dad raced in Nascar.

44:42.934 --> 44:46.495
Until he hit a wall at 150
and shattered his clutch leg.

44:47.172 --> 44:48.264
Ouch.

44:48.339 --> 44:49.465
Yeah.

44:50.542 --> 44:53.807
He wasn't the same after that. It was like
living with a ghost.

44:53.878 --> 44:55.709
Yöu knew he was there but,

44:55.780 --> 44:58.112
he only made himself
visible when he felt like it.

44:58.183 --> 45:00.310
But, yöu're closer now, right?

45:00.385 --> 45:03.354
Sure, from a
geographical standpoint.

45:04.255 --> 45:07.281
But ah, I don't
know, it's weird.

45:07.992 --> 45:09.050
What is?

45:09.127 --> 45:10.651
Trying to communicate.

45:12.497 --> 45:16.490
He's, it's like it's
just too much to say.

45:16.568 --> 45:19.833
That's not a bad problem
to have, trust me.

45:23.842 --> 45:25.139
Do yöu want to go for a drive?

45:25.210 --> 45:25.869

45:25.944 --> 45:26.933
Okay.

a look at my car?

46:37.048 --> 46:42.111
Maybe this weekend, I got to get
this head gasket replaced, asap.

46:44.689 --> 46:45.587
Forget it.

46:46.124 --> 46:48.456
I'll figure it out myself.

46:55.366 --> 46:57.231
What's the problem?

46:57.302 --> 47:00.601
It's getting fuel,
it's getting spark, the timing

47:00.672 --> 47:04.164
beIt's not broken, vacuum lines
are all good. I don't get it.

47:04.242 --> 47:06.335
Normally, I'd run a diagnostic
with Mikey's laptop,

47:06.411 --> 47:08.174
but obviously I can't do that.

47:16.588 --> 47:18.249
Try it now.

47:20.525 --> 47:23.016
Start the damned thing already.

<font color="#ff00ff">(</font><font color="#ff0000">ENGINE STARTS</font><font color="#ff00ff">)</font>

47:29.067 --> 47:30.932
Yöu forgot to torque
down the crank sensor.

47:31.002 --> 47:32.765
That's why it was
running rough before.

47:32.837 --> 47:35.738
And those poly mounts yöu got
probably helped shake it loose.

47:37.308 --> 47:39.037
I didn't even think
to check that.

47:39.110 --> 47:40.077
Uh.

47:40.144 --> 47:42.112
It's a 2.5, right?

47:42.180 --> 47:43.477
Yeah.

47:43.548 --> 47:45.880
Yeah, so yöur taxing those
little injectors with yöur big

47:45.950 --> 47:48.441
turbo, it might be
running lean on top end.

47:48.519 --> 47:49.781
Just seemed to pull
hard through the red

47:49.854 --> 47:50.843
Iine last time I checked.

47:50.922 --> 47:53.356
It could pull harder
is all I'm saying.

47:53.424 --> 47:56.518
Anyway, now that it's running...

47:56.594 --> 47:58.289
I need yöu to go on a parts run.

47:58.363 --> 47:59.261
Where to?

48:03.968 --> 48:05.401
Kendall's.

48:05.970 --> 48:07.961
Yöu buy parts from
the competition?

48:08.039 --> 48:10.507
Competition, I'm lucky
to be in business.

48:10.575 --> 48:13.305
And, it's too late to drive
all the way to Pep Boys.

48:15.513 --> 48:17.208
Yöu're welcome.

48:19.283 --> 48:20.545

Kruger, I'm glad yöu stopped by.

53:13.010 --> 53:15.171
I think we got off on
the wrong foot, yöu see,

53:15.246 --> 53:18.511
I didn't realize I was in
the presence of a celebrity.

53:18.582 --> 53:20.982
I did a little digging and
it seems yöu were a big

53:21.052 --> 53:23.077

Not that that means much,

53:23.154 --> 53:25.418

a bunch of rice rockets.

53:25.489 --> 53:26.956
<font color="#ffff00">All:</font> Ohhhh.

53:28.159 --> 53:31.526
But, yöur wins did land yöu a
high profile sponsorship,

53:31.595 --> 53:33.927
which surprised me at first.

53:33.998 --> 53:36.296

53:44.642 --> 53:47.304

Yöu couldn't come
close the other night.

54:07.765 --> 54:09.426

54:09.500 --> 54:10.990

54:11.068 --> 54:13.400
Well then, let's
settle it right now.

54:17.908 --> 54:20.399
We got a few hours
before the bars close,

54:20.478 --> 54:23.140
and yöu have to scoop
yöur old man off the floor.

54:24.682 --> 54:26.479
That is why yöu
moved here, right,

54:26.550 --> 54:28.745
to be yöur dad's

54:28.819 --> 54:29.945
Ohhhh.

54:30.021 --> 54:31.079

says he does good work.

Yöu're not thinking straight.

keep it on the track.

Maybe it's time to forgive him.

01:04:44.801 --> 01:04:46.701
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.

01:04:48.338 --> 01:04:49.396
I know.

01:04:51.775 --> 01:04:52.935
I love yöu.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:55.410
I love yöu, too.

01:05:24.374 --> 01:05:26.399
Why did yöu leave?

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.414
Ah, I fell apart,
I ruined everything,

01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:42.651
trying to make an impossible
path instead of finishing

01:05:42.726 --> 01:05:45.661
second and having a
family and a career.

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:55.301
Hey...

01:05:58.041 --> 01:06:01.408
do yöu remember the time I came to pick
yöu up from school...

01:06:01.478 --> 01:06:04.379
right before l, I took off?

01:06:05.682 --> 01:06:06.910
No.

01:06:06.983 --> 01:06:09.918
Yöu had a 104-degree fever,

01:06:10.654 --> 01:06:13.248
the school nurse called
for us to pick yöu up.

01:06:14.725 --> 01:06:18.024
Mom was at work, I didn't
have a job because l...

01:06:20.464 --> 01:06:22.193
well, when I got there...

01:06:25.769 --> 01:06:27.964
they wouldn't release yöu to me.

01:06:28.038 --> 01:06:30.472
I mean it wasn't even
10:30 in the morning,

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:33.168
and I was already
half a bottle in.

01:06:34.811 --> 01:06:36.438
I don't remember that.

01:06:42.753 --> 01:06:44.914
Yöu know what I do remember?

01:06:45.989 --> 01:06:49.049
It was the first time yöu took me for a
ride in this beast.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.820
I had butterflies in my
stomach the whole time.

01:06:53.296 --> 01:06:56.265
That feeling of
acceleration was so intense,

01:06:56.333 --> 01:07:00.360
I was really scared
at first, then I felt safe.

01:07:02.405 --> 01:07:04.737
Cause I knew yöu were
behind the wheel.

01:07:12.415 --> 01:07:13.712
Yöu know what...

01:07:15.252 --> 01:07:17.482
as hard as it is to hear it,

01:07:18.655 --> 01:07:22.318
I'm glad I mean it's better that I wasn't
there for the last few

01:07:22.392 --> 01:07:25.828
years, cause it wasn't pretty and yöu'd
hate me even more.

01:07:25.896 --> 01:07:29.127
I didn't hate yöu.
I never hated yöu.

01:07:30.267 --> 01:07:34.601
But, yöu know, a
visit every once in a

01:07:34.671 --> 01:07:36.662
while would have been nice.

01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:41.509
Yeah, I should have been there.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.160
Thanks. I'll get a
ride home from Max.

01:08:11.908 --> 01:08:14.968
Hey Kruger, where's yöur ride?

01:08:15.045 --> 01:08:16.511
Working on any new mods?

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.138
It's wrecked, yöu guys.

01:08:18.215 --> 01:08:19.078
I'm out.

Where's Fernando?

01:08:26.256 --> 01:08:28.850
He's supposed to be up there
playing Ben, I need a Ben.

01:08:28.925 --> 01:08:30.415
He's in the bathroom.

01:08:30.493 --> 01:08:31.960
Are yöu kidding me?

01:08:32.028 --> 01:08:33.551
I'll do it.

01:08:35.232 --> 01:08:36.493
Oh.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.126
Huh.

01:08:40.703 --> 01:08:43.639
Nice to see yöu
coming around, Danny.

01:08:45.742 --> 01:08:48.643
All right, yöu know what,
before yöu just jump in,

01:08:48.712 --> 01:08:51.374
I want yöu to tell me in
yöur own words, what do

01:08:51.448 --> 01:08:54.281
yöu think that Ben is
trying to say to Claire?

01:08:55.952 --> 01:08:57.283
Ahhh...

01:08:57.354 --> 01:08:59.720
All right, just remember,
he's a compulsive gambler

01:08:59.788 --> 01:09:02.279
and he just bet everything
on the wrong horse,

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.156
and now he has to face her.

01:09:04.227 --> 01:09:06.787
<font color="#ffff00">Danny:</font> I guess he's...
saying he's sorry.

01:09:06.863 --> 01:09:07.955
Sorry?

01:09:08.031 --> 01:09:11.296
Dan... He just gambled
away her wedding ring,

01:09:11.368 --> 01:09:13.768
yöu're going to have to do
better than, I'm sorry.

01:09:13.837 --> 01:09:18.671
Ahh...
he'd say he was stupid,

01:09:18.742 --> 01:09:22.609
and that he let his addiction get the best
of him.

01:09:22.679 --> 01:09:25.307
<font color="#ffff00">Parker:</font> Good. What else?

01:09:25.381 --> 01:09:27.612
He'd say he should have
listened when she

01:09:27.684 --> 01:09:31.142
tried to help him,
and he'd say thank yöu.

01:09:32.122 --> 01:09:33.555
Yöu're welcome.

01:09:58.615 --> 01:10:02.415
Well, that's a familiar
sight, I can't remember

01:10:02.485 --> 01:10:04.043
the last time I saw
yöu driving it.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.088
Ah, just thought l'd
dust her off and take

01:10:06.156 --> 01:10:07.646
my son to school today.

01:10:07.724 --> 01:10:09.692
I guess yöu heard our
boys got a little rowdy

01:10:09.759 --> 01:10:12.489
the other night, just like we
used to, except of course ah,

01:10:12.562 --> 01:10:13.824
Kendall won this time.

01:10:13.897 --> 01:10:15.228
Heard it was close.

01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:17.266
Ah, yöur boy didn't
have much of a chance.

01:10:17.334 --> 01:10:19.666
Got half my shop
bolted under Jake's V8.

01:10:19.736 --> 01:10:20.828
It'd end up lower, next.

01:10:20.904 --> 01:10:21.928
<font color="#ffff00">Frank:</font> Uh huh.

01:10:22.706 --> 01:10:25.504
It's good for business.
When he wins.

01:10:25.575 --> 01:10:27.372
All the other kids come in and
they spend all their money.

01:10:27.444 --> 01:10:28.604
Right.

01:10:31.014 --> 01:10:32.879
Hey, yöu know, l, I'm not
really sure that yöur

01:10:32.949 --> 01:10:36.112
boy's got much of a future
in racing, but hey...

01:10:36.186 --> 01:10:40.418
yöu can always change the name
of that shop to Kruger and Son.

01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:47.092
Ah, yöu know something, Jimmy,
it's one thing to understand

01:10:47.163 --> 01:10:50.132
how to bolt after market
parts to yöur car...

01:10:52.002 --> 01:10:54.163
It's another thing entirely...

01:10:55.305 --> 01:10:58.900

all work together.

Hey kid, what's going on?

01:12:19.089 --> 01:12:21.148
Remember guys, it's the last
day to turn in yöur permission

01:12:21.224 --> 01:12:23.920
slips for the Drag. So, drop
them if yöu got them.

01:12:39.275 --> 01:12:41.470
I'm glad yöu're still in.

01:12:50.053 --> 01:12:52.317
Yöu guys want to be
part of my pit crew?

01:12:52.388 --> 01:12:54.117
Hell, yeah.

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:59.592
We got three days boys,
so let's get this front

01:12:59.662 --> 01:13:01.892
end stripped,
I mean everything.

01:13:01.965 --> 01:13:04.433
Could yöu guys use
another pair of hands?

01:13:09.572 --> 01:13:10.903
Thank yöu.

01:13:10.974 --> 01:13:14.034
Two fenders, front cross member,
radiator supports, two A arms,

01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:18.171
inter cooler, motor mounts and
the grand total is...

01:13:18.982 --> 01:13:22.179
There's no way, it's too much.

01:13:27.657 --> 01:13:31.718
All right, it's a school
night, everyone go home.

01:13:32.862 --> 01:13:35.092
We'll regroup tomorrow.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.919
Hey Randy.

01:13:58.988 --> 01:14:00.785
Same to yöu.

01:14:01.791 --> 01:14:03.850
Yöu still got yöur
eyes on my Buick?

<font color="#ffff00">Mark:</font> Frank, wow,
long time no see.

Yeah, what can I do for yöu?

01:14:29.953 --> 01:14:34.913
Ah, I ah, I really
need yöu to hook me up.

01:14:34.991 --> 01:14:36.458
It's for my boy.

01:14:37.493 --> 01:14:39.017
Oh wow.

01:14:39.095 --> 01:14:41.461
Yeah, he's racing in
the high school drags.

01:15:05.321 --> 01:15:06.948
Yöu sold the Buick?

01:15:08.358 --> 01:15:09.518
Yep.

01:15:11.961 --> 01:15:13.622
Should be enough left
over for the rest

01:15:13.696 --> 01:15:15.789
of the performance stuff.

01:15:17.767 --> 01:15:19.667
But, it won yöu
yöur first trophy.

01:15:22.338 --> 01:15:25.034
Time to let go of the past
and focus on what's ahead.

01:15:27.377 --> 01:15:29.004
Thanks, Dad.

01:15:30.046 --> 01:15:31.707
It's the least I could do.

01:15:34.183 --> 01:15:36.481

Don't ask.

01:16:53.663 --> 01:16:55.893
I thought it would be good
advertising for the shop.

01:16:55.965 --> 01:16:57.330
Yeah, he's thinking
about turning this place

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.129

to the NHRA California

01:17:29.165 --> 01:17:32.532
High School Drags. With over
65 student racers from

01:17:32.602 --> 01:17:36.163
32 high schools, this is
our biggest event ever.

01:17:36.239 --> 01:17:39.606
Leading the pack, is Bradford
High School with six entries.

01:17:39.675 --> 01:17:43.008
Keep yöur eyes on hometown
favorite, Jake Kendall, and the

01:17:43.079 --> 01:17:45.445
whole gang from Kendall
Performance Centers.

01:17:45.515 --> 01:17:48.211
Newcomer, Danny Kruger has a
unique entry this year, fielding

01:17:48.284 --> 01:17:52.516
a 2.5-liter, four cylinder,
all wheel drive Subaru STl.

01:17:52.588 --> 01:17:54.818
It's one of the only four
cylinder's in competition,

01:17:54.891 --> 01:17:57.724
and it's going head to head
with all these big V8s.

01:17:57.794 --> 01:18:00.661
Let's see if this little
Subaru has what it takes.

01:18:00.730 --> 01:18:03.426
We'd like to thank all our
sponsors, including Grant

01:18:03.499 --> 01:18:05.399
Steering Wheels,
Brarer Racing...

01:18:06.636 --> 01:18:08.297
Yöu guys get unloaded,
I'll get us registered.

01:18:08.371 --> 01:18:09.099
Yöu got it.

01:18:18.948 --> 01:18:21.314
<font color="#ffff00">Announcer:</font> Next up in the
warm up round, we have Miguel

01:18:21.384 --> 01:18:25.184
Sanchez with his classic turbo
diesel truck, Little Red.

01:18:45.608 --> 01:18:48.600
11.22 and 11.41.

01:18:48.678 --> 01:18:51.078
I've seen both these cars run
quicker, so I don't think

01:18:51.147 --> 01:18:53.445
they're giving it
all they've got.

01:18:54.851 --> 01:18:56.876
Yöu're going down, Kruger.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.788
It runs in the family.

01:18:59.856 --> 01:19:02.484
Like father, like son.

01:19:03.826 --> 01:19:06.124
Looks like yöu picked
the wrong team, Jess.

01:19:06.195 --> 01:19:08.288

the wrong friend.

We're good to go.

01:19:16.272 --> 01:19:17.864
Fantastic.

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.067
All right, let's get yöur
ass to the starting line.

01:19:20.142 --> 01:19:21.837
Warm-up round is almost over.

01:19:21.911 --> 01:19:24.971
First run, all yöu have to
do is come under 13 seconds.

01:19:25.047 --> 01:19:26.446
That should be no problem.

01:19:26.516 --> 01:19:27.574
Okay.

01:19:32.588 --> 01:19:35.580
<font color="#ffff00">Announcer:</font> This is the last race of the
warm-up round and we

01:19:35.658 --> 01:19:38.718
have Danny Kruger and his STl.
His opponent is Alex Dodd in

01:19:38.794 --> 01:19:42.355
his retro Ford Mustang from
Washington High School.

01:19:46.602 --> 01:19:49.969
Look at that burnout. Dodd is
getting those tires nice and

01:19:50.039 --> 01:19:53.202
sticky so he can get maximum
traction off the starting line.

01:19:53.276 --> 01:19:55.471
No need to heat up yöur
tires when yöu got all

01:19:55.545 --> 01:19:57.672
wheel drive like that Subaru.

01:20:12.728 --> 01:20:15.925
Kruger stumbles off the starting
line and the Mustang is gone.

01:20:15.998 --> 01:20:18.466
Let's see if Kruger
can catch him.

01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:38.115
And, no sir, Alex Dodd
comes in first with a 12.29.

01:20:38.187 --> 01:20:42.385
Danny Kruger barely
qualifies with a 12.98.

01:20:44.427 --> 01:20:47.521
Ah, it's in the bag.

01:20:49.165 --> 01:20:49.756
Hey.

01:20:49.832 --> 01:20:50.799
I know, I know.

01:20:50.866 --> 01:20:52.231
Come on, man.

01:20:52.301 --> 01:20:54.292
The track is stickier than the
street, I wasn't expecting that.

01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:55.564
At least I had a
solid track speed.

01:20:55.638 --> 01:20:58.106
Every run, from now on,
yöur time has to drop.

01:20:58.174 --> 01:20:59.436
Yöu should be in the elevens.

01:20:59.508 --> 01:21:02.170
Yöu lost another race, we're
out of here, it's over.

01:21:02.244 --> 01:21:04.144
Now, get focused.

01:21:04.213 --> 01:21:05.942
<font color="#ffff00">Announcer:</font> Let's cheer
on all our racers, as we

01:21:06.015 --> 01:21:08.950
head into round one.
Coming up to the line now is

01:21:09.018 --> 01:21:12.920
Grant Warner and his
1969 Oldsmobile 442.

01:21:12.989 --> 01:21:15.355
Grant's been testing all summer,
and let me tell yöu folks,

01:21:15.424 --> 01:21:18.484
those wheelie bars aren't
just for looks.

01:21:19.462 --> 01:21:21.930
But, he's going against
Jake Kendall, with his

01:21:21.998 --> 01:21:25.832
2011 Mustang GT. We're
kicking things off with two

01:21:25.901 --> 01:21:28.199
of our fastest racers
going head to head.

Look at Jake give
Grant the thumbs down,

01:21:49.158 --> 01:21:51.422
Jake is feeling
confident, folks.

01:22:20.523 --> 01:22:22.150
<font color="#ff00ff">(</font><font color="#ff0000">SCREECHING</font><font color="#ff00ff">)</font>

01:22:26.028 --> 01:22:29.156
Ouch folks, seems like Grant
pushed his 442 a little too

01:22:29.231 --> 01:22:32.098
hard, and that car's
going home on a trailer.

01:22:32.168 --> 01:22:36.605
Jake Kendall wins with a
10.98 and 127 miles per hour.

01:22:49.985 --> 01:22:53.443
Next up, Danny Kruger's STl,
versus Kevin Picara

01:22:53.522 --> 01:22:55.922
in his 1970 Chevy Nova.

01:22:55.991 --> 01:22:58.516
Let's see if Danny gets his
launch right this time.

01:23:02.098 --> 01:23:03.929
Oh, and a good launch
for Danny Kruger as he

01:23:03.999 --> 01:23:05.830
jumps ahead of the Nova.

01:23:15.211 --> 01:23:17.577
And he did it. Danny
Kruger advances to the

01:23:17.646 --> 01:23:21.446
next round with an 11.40
and 121 miles per hour.

01:23:21.517 --> 01:23:24.714
That's a solid run from
that little 4 cylinder.

01:23:25.488 --> 01:23:28.719
Well, it's hard to miss Andrea
Faust in her hot pink Dodge.

01:23:31.093 --> 01:23:33.152
This girl has been
racing her whole life,

01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:35.823
and knows how to get the
boys a run for their money.

01:23:35.898 --> 01:23:38.332
And, they sure love
watching her race.

01:23:50.913 --> 01:23:53.643
Andrea Faust advances
to the next round.

01:23:53.716 --> 01:23:55.911
Folks, there is some serious
competition and these kids

01:23:55.985 --> 01:23:59.113
are not taking it lightly.
Let's see who's got it.

01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:02.787
<font color="#ffff00">Max:</font> Hey, how yöu doing?

Good to see yöu.
Yöu guys racing?

01:24:07.029 --> 01:24:08.690
No, we're with Danny Kruger.

01:24:08.764 --> 01:24:11.028
He's in the Subaru over there.

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:13.398
Yeah. Looking good.

01:24:13.469 --> 01:24:14.697
Like a birthday cake.

01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:16.567
<font color="#ffff00">Announcer:</font> In the quarter
final round we have another

01:24:16.639 --> 01:24:19.107

from Bradford High School.

01:24:19.175 --> 01:24:22.770
Clint Johnson in his 1969 Chevy
Chevelle, who is up against

01:24:22.845 --> 01:24:25.678
Danny Kruger and his
fast and furious 4 bay.

01:24:34.423 --> 01:24:36.414
Clint smokes up his
tires as Danny drives

01:24:36.492 --> 01:24:38.426
around the burn out box.

01:24:40.563 --> 01:24:43.225
The winner here advances
to the semi-finals.

<font color="#ffff00">Clint:</font> Come on,
come on, come on.

No, no, no.

01:25:17.533 --> 01:25:21.799
Kruger easily takes it, with
an 11.17 to Johnson's 11.88.

01:25:21.871 --> 01:25:23.668
Yes! We did it.

01:25:28.711 --> 01:25:30.838

his super charged
Mustang from Bradford.

Jake Kendall advances to the
championship final round.

01:26:22.731 --> 01:26:25.029
That's our fastest
run of the day.

01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.933
For our second semi-final
round, we have Miguel Sanchez

01:26:28.003 --> 01:26:31.564
and his Dodge truck
versus Kruger and his STl.

01:26:32.374 --> 01:26:33.306
Hi Tom.

01:26:33.375 --> 01:26:34.967

I see three of yöur
students up there.

01:26:40.115 --> 01:26:41.878
That's impressive.

01:26:43.385 --> 01:26:45.080
Any bets who takes it?

01:26:47.323 --> 01:26:49.154
That's all yöu're
going to give me?

01:26:49.792 --> 01:26:52.056
Fluids are good,
everything checks out.

01:26:52.127 --> 01:26:53.219
Ready to roll?

01:27:01.570 --> 01:27:03.367
What a moron.

01:27:06.842 --> 01:27:09.140
Hey, that thing's
got massive torque,

01:27:09.211 --> 01:27:11.543
he's going to beat yöu off
the start no matter what.

01:27:11.613 --> 01:27:13.205
Don't let that screw
with yöur concentration.

01:27:13.282 --> 01:27:16.251
Focus on maximum traction.
Yöu will catch him

01:27:16.318 --> 01:27:18.616

quarter. Reel him in.

that this little Subaru has

round, but now Kruger
has work cut out for him.

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.372
Jake Kendall has posted
quicker quarter mile times and

01:28:47.443 --> 01:28:50.742
faster track speed than Danny
all day. Danny's really got to

01:28:50.813 --> 01:28:54.214
hope for a miracle, or at
least a couple more cylinders.

01:28:54.283 --> 01:28:55.614
What are yöu doing with that?

01:28:55.684 --> 01:28:57.584
Cranking up the boost,
otherwise I don't think

01:28:57.653 --> 01:28:59.018
I can do much better
than my last run.

01:28:59.088 --> 01:29:02.683
Danny, what are yöu doing?
Yöur turbo's maxed out,

01:29:02.758 --> 01:29:04.419
yöu're going to blow yöur
motor like that out of the..

01:29:04.493 --> 01:29:06.290
It's only set a 22 psi,
I can still turn it up a bit,

01:29:06.361 --> 01:29:08.158
it might give me
enough of an edge.

01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:10.255
Yöu know how yöu shave a
few tenths off yöur time?

01:29:10.332 --> 01:29:11.458
How?

01:29:12.601 --> 01:29:13.829
Power shift on this one.

01:29:13.902 --> 01:29:15.529
Isn't that just as dangerous?

01:29:15.604 --> 01:29:19.199
No, only if yöu screw
up. Not much point.

01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:25.380

Kruger kid showing us up.

01:29:25.447 --> 01:29:28.041

on and the muffler's off.

01:29:36.191 --> 01:29:37.522
Yöu should get a
lot more top end.

01:29:37.593 --> 01:29:38.958
But do not rev it too high.

01:29:39.027 --> 01:29:40.255

What's power shifting?

01:29:59.181 --> 01:30:00.910
<font color="#ffff00">Frank:</font> It's shifting without
lifting off the throttle.

Yöu have to be lightning
