the ones that blew up,

02:08.520 --> 02:09.944

to pour out of me.

nothing.

Anyway, my fantasy

02:27.314 --> 02:30.223
is to be able to write
my own songs again.

02:30.376 --> 02:31.725
- I understand.

02:31.819 --> 02:36.655
And rest assured, the Island
is a very, very creative place.

Why don't you get settled?

02:38.050 --> 02:39.307

No, no, we're not here for me.
