01:44.354 --> 01:48.525
<i>Where will you be on New Year's Day
as we celebrate the coming of 2000?</i>

01:48.608 --> 01:50.652
<i>A throng of people are heading
to Jeongdongjin</i>

01:50.735 --> 01:52.612
<i>to see the first sunrise of the new year.</i>

01:56.658 --> 02:01.121
For dinner, we're having
tasty roast chicken!

02:01.204 --> 02:04.374
That's enough already.
Just call your family, please.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.627
I think there's someone in my house.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.214
-There's someone in the bathroom.
-What?

02:11.840 --> 02:12.799
Where again?

02:14.634 --> 02:17.971
For the last few days,
someone has been in the bathtub--

02:18.054 --> 02:20.557
-I ordered it!
-Hey, deal with him.

02:21.516 --> 02:26.271
-For the hardworking police…
-Please just leave already.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.647
We can just eat it here.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.816
Can you fill out this form first?

02:33.945 --> 02:36.322
Are your parents home?

02:38.116 --> 02:39.242
No.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.953
But my mom will get off work soon.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.038
Then bring your mom with you.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.166
But…

02:47.041 --> 02:48.626
Mom says there's no one there.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.586
What?

02:50.253 --> 02:51.254
Mom says

02:52.088 --> 02:53.423
the woman isn't in there.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.176
What are you saying?

02:57.886 --> 02:59.429
You said there was someone in your house.

03:00.388 --> 03:03.016
-It was a woman?
-Mom says there's no one there.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.728
That's why I came to you.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.607
I was hoping you would come
check it out with me.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.191
What do you mean?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.068
Are you all right?

03:14.652 --> 03:16.988
What? You already left?

03:17.071 --> 03:19.616
I can't believe it. It's pouring outside.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.912
Who would deliver roast chicken
to a precinct?

03:23.995 --> 03:25.997
It doesn't make any sense.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.999
Hey, fill out the form, okay?

03:29.542 --> 03:30.835
Hello?

03:31.586 --> 03:32.879
Where is your location?

03:34.130 --> 03:36.716
Near Yeongwon Tollgate? Okay.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.594
Oh, we can provide support.

03:39.677 --> 03:43.514
SERVICE AND ORDER

04:01.658 --> 04:02.742
Mom.

04:05.828 --> 04:06.996
Mom.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.676
Are you home?
Where did you go in the rain?

04:21.761 --> 04:23.763
Mom, did you fill the bathtub with water?

04:23.846 --> 04:25.181
Yes, I did. Why?

04:25.265 --> 04:28.643
Why did you fill it?
I told you not to do that.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.979
What are you saying? I'm tired.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.480
I'm going to take a bath.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.399
What if that woman is there again?

04:34.482 --> 04:37.485
Silly girl, there's no woman there.
Stay out of the bathroom then.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.404
Don't turn off the faucet
like you did last time.

06:09.952 --> 06:12.038
Kyung-jin, where are you?

06:17.251 --> 06:19.378
What are you doing? Are you washing up?

06:19.962 --> 06:22.465
Open the door. Are you sick?

06:26.928 --> 06:28.012
What did you say?

06:30.181 --> 06:31.474
What are you saying?

06:31.557 --> 06:33.267
Open the door! Now!

07:08.302 --> 07:09.470
I'm sorry,

07:10.596 --> 07:13.224
but could you open the door for a minute?

07:22.650 --> 07:26.070
Could you open
a little more than that, please?

07:29.282 --> 07:32.201
If it's all right with you,
could you open it all the way?

07:39.709 --> 07:41.544
While I was hospitalized…

07:44.422 --> 07:46.966
my symptoms have worsened.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.886
I get uneasy in closed spaces.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.054
Have you recovered

07:52.972 --> 07:55.057
from your injuries a little?

07:55.808 --> 07:57.643
I have a cast on my arm,

07:59.020 --> 08:00.521
but I'm doing a lot better.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.858
We're sorry for asking you to come

08:03.941 --> 08:07.320
to answer a few questions
when you're still recovering.

08:08.696 --> 08:09.822
It's fine.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.286
Except for my insomnia,

08:16.245 --> 08:17.747
my condition isn't that bad.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.832
Do you have any aftereffects

08:20.875 --> 08:23.920
stemming from
the Cheonyang Water Treatment accident?

08:30.426 --> 08:31.928
Well, not exactly.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.389
But I've quit drinking

08:36.182 --> 08:38.643
after being a heavy drinker my whole life.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.523
Sort of like a withdrawal symptom.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.585
So…

09:05.753 --> 09:07.380
Should I get right into it?

09:08.673 --> 09:11.801
You'd like to know the events leading up
to the Cheonyang accident, right?

09:11.884 --> 09:13.678
Yes, sir.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.100
Then where should I begin?

09:20.476 --> 09:22.144
Should I try to tell you

09:22.228 --> 09:24.564
what I remember about the incident
in chronological order?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.482
Sure. We would appreciate that.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.946
The first incident began

09:33.948 --> 09:35.908
in July, I think. Is that correct?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.995
PROFILE REPORT: JO KYUNG-HO

09:39.078 --> 09:40.413
SAJU SERIAL MURDERS

09:40.496 --> 09:42.915
HONGAN-DONG MOTHER-DAUGHTER
MURDER CASE, JULY 12, 1999

09:42.999 --> 09:45.376
That's right. It happened on July 12th.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.587
As you probably know,

09:48.713 --> 09:52.300
I'm a detective with the Gyeongsangnam-do
regional police agency.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.219
Last year,

09:56.429 --> 09:58.431
I was assigned a new partner.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.684
So I was busy getting him up to speed

10:03.561 --> 10:05.021
with our work.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.524
<i>This might be an insignificant detail,</i>

10:08.608 --> 10:11.402
<i>but it rained a lot on the day</i>

10:11.485 --> 10:13.863
<i>the first victim was found.</i>

10:13.946 --> 10:15.031
<i>As you probably know,</i>

10:15.114 --> 10:17.617
<i>the monsoon lasted
longer than usual this year.</i>

10:18.200 --> 10:20.286
<i>It was raining so hard that.</i>

10:21.495 --> 10:22.830
<i>Lee Shi-jung.</i>

10:22.913 --> 10:24.707
<i>He's my new partner I mentioned.</i>

10:26.334 --> 10:27.668
<i>He was new.</i>

10:28.377 --> 10:30.463
His name is Lee Shi-jung.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.425
Well, on days when it rained a lot,

10:34.508 --> 10:36.427
he would come and pick me up at my house

10:38.095 --> 10:40.931
because rush hour would be worse.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.810
We both lived in downtown Saju,

10:45.311 --> 10:47.313
and my house wasn't that far from his.
So I didn't think much of it.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.648
I later found out

10:50.316 --> 10:54.570
he moved to the downtown area
with his wife because of me.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.951
I assumed he was really passionate
about his job.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.705
He also probably
wanted to ask me questions

11:05.331 --> 11:07.792
during our morning commute.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.545
I see.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.467
It's peculiar.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.263
I can still remember those little details

11:22.973 --> 11:24.392
so vividly.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.732
I think…

11:34.944 --> 11:37.321
this summer changed my life completely.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.438
Sir, can I ask you something?

12:11.021 --> 12:14.692
What did you do
whenever a New Year comes, sir?

12:16.026 --> 12:17.862
What exactly do you mean?

12:18.529 --> 12:22.241
I mean, on every New Year's Eve,
they ring the bell and countdown.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.952
I don't know.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.705
I don't really care much
for New Year's Day.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.373
Oh, is that so, sir?

12:29.457 --> 12:33.919
Sir, then perhaps have you heard of Y2K?

12:34.003 --> 12:35.004
What?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.716
It's been on the news lately.
You haven't heard about it?

12:38.799 --> 12:41.218
Next year, a lot of computers

12:41.302 --> 12:44.930
will mistake the year 2000 for 1000
and create complete chaos.

12:45.014 --> 12:45.931
And so?

12:46.557 --> 12:49.143
They say it's going to be a huge problem.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.896
It could launch nuclear missiles
and shut down power plants.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.023
Money in your bank account could vanish.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.566
It'll be total chaos.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.652
They say it'll be the end of the world.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.947
But people seem to be wishing
that it'll happen.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.742
They want to see the world end.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.036
-Detective Lee.
-Yes?

13:07.119 --> 13:08.913
Is there anything going on?

13:11.332 --> 13:13.334
Sir, actually…

13:13.417 --> 13:16.420
I need to tell you beforehand
in case I commit a blunder.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.547
-In fact, this is my first case.
-First what?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.007
First murder case.

13:20.799 --> 13:24.470
So I'm really nervous.
I think that's why I talked about Y2K.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.765
Is that so?

13:28.516 --> 13:29.517
Yes, sir.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.227
So is there anything

13:31.894 --> 13:34.730
you can tell me
before we survey the scene?

13:34.813 --> 13:36.232
Any precautions to take?

13:38.692 --> 13:40.611
There is one precaution.

13:40.694 --> 13:41.987
What is it?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.907
Before you arrive at the scene,

13:45.658 --> 13:48.118
stay silent while driving there.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.375
Okay, sir.

14:07.137 --> 14:10.516
SEOGYEONG-DONG DISTRICT OFFICE

14:37.334 --> 14:38.419
Come in.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.132
Do you know the whereabouts
of the victim's husband?

14:43.215 --> 14:45.801
Yes, he's on an overseas
business trip in Japan.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.094
We were able to reach him.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.430
But due to heavy rains,

14:49.513 --> 14:51.223
Gimpo Airport has been shut down.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.225
He said he could make it here tomorrow.

14:57.271 --> 15:01.025
But how did the detective mobile unit
get assigned to this case?

15:01.108 --> 15:04.570
-It usually takes a while for that.
-We're the mobile investigation unit now.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.405
-There was a name change.
-Oh, really?

15:06.488 --> 15:09.366
I'm certain it was called
the DMU a few months ago.

15:10.451 --> 15:14.330
Oh, it was changed less than a month ago.
So the chief has made this a top priority.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.665
He wants to make a good impression
to the commissioner.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.542
That's why we came here directly.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.045
Why do you always change
your unit's name? It's confusing.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.338
I totally agree.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.423
-But Detective Lee.
-Yes?

15:24.506 --> 15:26.800
Is it hot in here? You're sweating.

15:28.135 --> 15:31.513
Oh, really? Am I sweating?
Oh, it's raindrops.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.432
-Why aren't you coming?
-Coming.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.393
Well… After you, sir.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.813
What? I'm about to return to the precinct.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.190
-I'm very busy.
-Really?

15:41.273 --> 15:42.232
Yes.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.277
Gosh.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.289
Do we know
where her daughter, Kyung-jin is?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.916
No, not yet.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.753
Is the cause of death

16:02.836 --> 16:05.881
these stab wounds on the neck
that caused blood loss?

16:05.965 --> 16:08.342
Yes, the victim has eight stab wounds

16:08.425 --> 16:11.470
on her face and neck.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.889
Show me the murder weapon.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.308
We haven't found it yet.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.648
Looking at the size of the wounds,

16:22.731 --> 16:26.235
it seems that the weapon had
a short, sharp blade.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.698
The purple spots on her thigh and calf

16:30.781 --> 16:33.617
indicate she was dragged here
after suffering lethal injuries.

16:50.217 --> 16:53.595
So you think the murder
was a vengeful act?

16:54.263 --> 16:56.265
Yes. The killing was extremely brutal.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.768
So I think that could be very likely.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.187
Once her husband returns,

17:02.271 --> 17:04.565
we'll be able to find out
who had a grudge against them.

17:04.648 --> 17:05.774
Okay.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.111
Once he arrives in the country,
I'll find out where he'll be staying.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.197
But there's a more urgent matter.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.159
We don't know
where the victim's daughter is.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.535
What?

17:17.119 --> 17:19.246
That means the daughter is in danger too.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.372
I presume she is.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.000
Geez.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.588
I think we have to move swiftly.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.424
The reporters are
already calling me constantly.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.261
How did they find out so soon?

17:34.762 --> 17:37.890
I've told you many times
that if we don't catch the killer quickly,

17:38.432 --> 17:40.350
then we get pressured a lot.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.984
What are you guys doing here?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.320
We're sorry.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.699
We were trying to boil this water.

18:44.456 --> 18:48.001
Sir. You talk to Kyung-jin a lot, right?

18:48.085 --> 18:49.628
Yes, she comes by often.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.296
Which class are you in?

18:51.380 --> 18:53.298
Are you in the same class with her?

18:53.382 --> 18:55.717
Not me, but she is.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.886
Really? Are you friends with her?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.263
She's really nice.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.516
She brings me snacks to eat.

19:02.599 --> 19:06.436
And she also gives me
mixtapes to listen to.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.900
I thought Kyung-jin was rude and mean.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.279
We heard that she gives
snacks to the security guard.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.572
She's really nice.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.282
Hey, don't say that.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.868
She says bad things about you
behind your back.

19:21.785 --> 19:24.413
She used to get the top grades

19:24.496 --> 19:27.791
but she probably hates you now
after you came out on top.

19:27.875 --> 19:28.917
What a lunatic.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.920
I heard she signed up for classes
at Lee Young-deok's Academy.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.630
Do you know the story about them?

19:33.714 --> 19:36.175
The reason why
Lee's Genius Academy is so popular?

19:36.258 --> 19:38.510
I heard they're fully booked
for the next six months.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.720
Really?

19:40.721 --> 19:42.472
That academy actually

19:43.348 --> 19:45.976
records all the questions
from our school exams

19:46.059 --> 19:48.854
one day before the exams
and gives it to the students.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.981
That's nonsense.

19:51.064 --> 19:54.526
Lee Young-deok used to be a teacher
at our school.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.112
And the teachers he worked with
are still at our school.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.115
So I've been thinking.
How about we run an article

20:00.199 --> 20:03.619
about Lee's Genius Academy
in next month's student broadcast?

20:03.702 --> 20:06.580
How long are we going to make mixtapes?

20:06.663 --> 20:09.416
If we run an article about that,

20:09.499 --> 20:11.960
Kyung-jin might put cyanide
in our school lunch.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.504
Look at you.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.299
You're laughing about cyanide.

20:25.807 --> 20:29.353
BROADCASTING ROOM

20:50.999 --> 20:53.126
How are you all doing?

20:53.210 --> 20:55.671
The short summer vacation is over

20:55.754 --> 20:58.131
and now we have to take
the much-hated extra classes.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.760
Is there a hole in the earth's atmosphere?
Why isn't this monsoon over already?

21:02.636 --> 21:05.222
We might not get a chance
to dip our feet in the river

21:05.305 --> 21:08.183
before starting extra classes like
steer heading to the market.

21:09.059 --> 21:12.771
We, the Team Mix Number Five,

21:12.854 --> 21:15.774
created mixtape No. 13 for you all

21:15.857 --> 21:18.777
to comfort your crushed souls
through music.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.615
We'll read a letter from a listener first

21:23.699 --> 21:25.701
and then play more music.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.621
"Hello. I'm in the 7th grade
in Class No. 2."

21:29.705 --> 21:31.873
"My ID is 'You Scared.'"

21:31.957 --> 21:32.874
"You Scared."

21:32.958 --> 21:35.168
-"You Scared" is a funny ID.
-Hey.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.254
Put in a little more effort
in writing the letters.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.881
Nobody listens to the letters anyway.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.592
Why do you always include them?

21:47.681 --> 21:48.765
Gosh.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.517
Who could it be?

21:50.600 --> 21:51.893
Is it the security guard?

21:52.477 --> 21:53.312
Who is it?

22:20.547 --> 22:22.507
DO NOT DISTURB
STREAMING IN PROGRESS

22:52.662 --> 22:54.790
I like mixtape No. 8.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.166
Me too.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.296
My niece's friends are amazing,
aren't they?

23:01.379 --> 23:03.298
Didn't she get the top score in her grade?

23:06.593 --> 23:08.011
You can come this way.

23:08.678 --> 23:09.805
Just a minute.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.352
Did you finish making <i>tangsuyuk</i>?

23:15.435 --> 23:16.728
Yes. I'm almost done.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.606
Then have Hwan-gyu finish it
and come out for a second.

23:19.689 --> 23:22.275
-What is it? Let me finish this first.
-Just come quickly.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.696
-Hwan-gyu.
-Okay.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.830
This is my daughter.
She works at the restaurant with me.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.373
Say hello.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.709
This is Pastor Woo Sung-min
from Hansung Light Church.

23:39.793 --> 23:43.130
This is Deaconess Yang,
Deacon Jo and Deacon Kim.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.341
They came to our restaurant to have lunch.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.343
Nice to meet you.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.262
The work must be hard.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.347
It's not that tough. Thank you for coming.

23:52.430 --> 23:53.640
Of course, we had to come.

23:54.349 --> 23:58.103
Deaconess Jung is devoted
to the church and volunteers a lot.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.148
Thank you, Pastor Woo.

24:01.231 --> 24:03.733
-Oh, please sit down.
-Sure.

24:07.696 --> 24:08.822
We were

24:09.447 --> 24:11.074
worried at first.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.035
Our congregation was worried too.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.039
There are still

24:18.748 --> 24:20.792
quite a lot of people in this neighborhood

24:20.876 --> 24:23.795
who have bad memories of that incident.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.509
To be honest, how could they forget it?

24:30.135 --> 24:33.013
I was very concerned
when you decided to continue

24:33.096 --> 24:34.681
coming to our church.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.226
But I was told that

24:38.310 --> 24:42.355
you and your daughter have volunteered

24:42.439 --> 24:43.899
a lot in the community

24:44.524 --> 24:45.901
for the last few months.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.361
Keep up the good work.

24:48.445 --> 24:52.324
I think it's a good thing
that you two have returned to our church.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.783
Oh my gosh.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.204
Thank you for saying such kind words.

24:59.581 --> 25:03.627
As the deaconess' daughter,
I urge you to keep volunteering.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.965
And every Sunday, don't miss church.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.092
You must

25:12.052 --> 25:14.012
ask the Lord for forgiveness.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.851
That's all you need to do.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.979
You just need to start all over.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.357
That is the right path.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.951
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

25:42.916 --> 25:44.876
Why are you smoking again?

25:45.877 --> 25:47.003
Just one cigarette.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.422
It was hard, wasn't it?

25:49.506 --> 25:52.259
Not really. It wasn't hard at all.

25:53.218 --> 25:56.304
There are members of the church
whose children died in that incident.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.309
But they're going to leave us alone

26:02.352 --> 26:04.104
after we decided to settle down here.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.398
That's a big relief.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.817
We should be thankful.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.447
Right.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.200
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

26:17.284 --> 26:19.869
Where are you going? To pick up Jae-young?

26:21.663 --> 26:22.914
I'll be back.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.681
Whoever gave us that cassette tape

26:39.764 --> 26:41.683
really spooked me.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.601
Why?

26:43.685 --> 26:44.811
Think about it.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.023
We don't know who gave it,
but that person came to school

26:48.106 --> 26:50.191
during summer vacation to deliver it.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.068
This has to be a tip.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.279
I'm not so sure.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.323
Look.

26:56.406 --> 26:59.868
If this tape contains recordings
of all the questions on the exam,

27:00.535 --> 27:03.204
then we can use this
to uncover the wrongdoings.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.708
Why are you laughing?

27:06.791 --> 27:08.376
You look so excited.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.005
Were you able to tell?

27:13.048 --> 27:15.967
I thought the broadcasting club
would be interesting.

27:16.801 --> 27:19.929
But all we do
is play classical music or Mozart

27:20.013 --> 27:22.599
during lunchtime
when everyone else is eating or napping.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.436
You know, I thought Mozart
was the name of a type of cheese.

27:26.519 --> 27:28.021
I didn't know it was a person.

27:31.232 --> 27:34.986
I'm forced to write fake letters
with fake stories for our broadcast.

27:36.112 --> 27:40.575
You had no idea this is what we're doing
when I asked you to join the club, right?

27:42.202 --> 27:43.411
No, I didn't.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.122
You totally lied to me.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.630
Bye. Let's talk later.

27:55.298 --> 27:56.341
Take care.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.427
-How was your day? Tough?
-No.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.429
All right.

28:02.806 --> 28:03.890
Give me your backpack.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.367
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

28:57.485 --> 28:59.112
Is it Tuesday already?

28:59.195 --> 29:02.031
That's right. Fried dumplings for dinner.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.372
-How's the club doing?
-What?

29:09.456 --> 29:12.625
Are you having fun with your friends
in the broadcasting club?

29:19.424 --> 29:23.094
Unfortunately, it was an uneventful day.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.220
Oh, gosh.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.600
I have to confess something to you.

29:28.683 --> 29:31.060
After much persuasion, I finally did it.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.438
Ta-da.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.486
What? You said
you wouldn't stick anything on it.

29:39.569 --> 29:42.614
Do you know how sad you looked
when I said no to that?

29:42.697 --> 29:45.533
Like a poor dog
that was abandoned by its owner.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.410
You swayed me.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.081
Do you like it?

29:54.334 --> 29:56.836
No, I don't like it at all.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.381
-Oh, really? I'll take it off then.
-No.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.677
-Let me have it.
-No.

30:04.761 --> 30:05.804
-Show it to me.
-I guess you don't like it.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.264
No, I do like it.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.823
LEE'S GENIUS ACADEMY

31:20.086 --> 31:22.171
Why did you go alone there
at that early hour?

31:23.464 --> 31:26.009
-What do you mean?
-The chief told me.

31:26.092 --> 31:29.220
That you went to the murder scene
early in the morning.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.389
I should have gone with you.

31:31.472 --> 31:33.391
Why didn't you tell me?

31:34.559 --> 31:36.519
I had this strange thought.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.147
What do you mean?

31:40.064 --> 31:43.568
On the night of the murder,
someone called the police

31:43.651 --> 31:45.528
about noise coming from their house.

31:46.112 --> 31:50.033
This was before the husband
called the police?

31:50.700 --> 31:51.701
Yes.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.454
But something doesn't sound right.

31:54.537 --> 31:55.788
What?

31:57.457 --> 31:58.666
I think the caller was

31:59.250 --> 32:02.378
the victim's daughter who is now missing.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.463
What?

32:04.464 --> 32:07.759
Why did you think the caller could be her?

32:09.677 --> 32:12.889
There are no signs of forced entry anyway.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.849
Most murder cases are like this.

32:24.567 --> 32:26.778
GYEONGCHEON GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL

32:40.249 --> 32:41.751
I'm sorry.

32:43.002 --> 32:45.004
I'm just hearing about this incident.

32:45.088 --> 32:47.006
So it's given me a sudden headache.

32:47.090 --> 32:51.219
News about the murder
will probably be reported tomorrow.

32:51.302 --> 32:55.014
Oh my gosh. How could this happen?

32:55.098 --> 32:59.560
Do you know anything about Lee Kyung-jin?

33:00.895 --> 33:03.106
Oh, she's in Class No. 3.

33:03.189 --> 33:06.317
And she came in second place
in the last school exam.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.820
We're not asking about her grades.

33:08.903 --> 33:11.322
Do you memorize
everyone's rank in the exam?

33:11.406 --> 33:12.949
Yes, up to the top five students.

33:13.032 --> 33:15.785
We pay careful attention to students

33:15.868 --> 33:18.329
who rank in the top five
from Grade 7 through Grade 9.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.666
Anyway, is there
a way to keep this under wraps?

33:22.458 --> 33:25.628
Reports of this will have an effect
on the students.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.338
The scores of our students
will be impacted

33:27.422 --> 33:30.174
by news reports of the murder
in their next school exam.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.594
My goodness.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.806
There doesn't seem to be any reason
for her to run away from home.

33:36.889 --> 33:38.224
She had good grades too.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.268
She never got in any trouble at school.

33:40.351 --> 33:41.728
You never know.

33:43.229 --> 33:44.772
What a jerk, don't you think?

33:44.856 --> 33:46.649
The principal only remembers the names
of the top five.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.694
Does he forget the names of students
who fall below the top five?

33:51.446 --> 33:53.197
I hated taking tests.

33:53.781 --> 33:56.617
I still have nightmares
of taking tests at school.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.703
And in my nightmare,
I forgot which books I had to study.

33:58.786 --> 34:01.414
So I can't answer even one question
while sweating like a pig.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.083
It's a recurring nightmare.

34:05.334 --> 34:06.794
Did something happen?

34:07.628 --> 34:10.757
Oh, we're not able to tell you yet.

34:10.840 --> 34:11.883
Oh, I see.

34:11.966 --> 34:12.884
I'm sorry.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.928
I don't what's going on,
but feel free to ask if you need my help.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.347
I know everything
that goes on in the school.

34:20.683 --> 34:21.934
Oh, sure.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.062
Okay.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.525
<i>We're not like other academies.</i>

34:29.609 --> 34:32.987
We nurture future leaders.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.114
We don't accept losers.

34:35.198 --> 34:37.241
Losers can't even step through the door.

34:37.325 --> 34:40.036
Either the parents have to be
rich enough to pay our fees

34:40.119 --> 34:42.371
or the students need to be very smart.

34:42.955 --> 34:45.792
Otherwise, we don't accept students

34:45.875 --> 34:49.337
who don't pass either one of them.

34:51.214 --> 34:53.758
Could you tell us about Lee Kyung-jin?

34:53.841 --> 34:56.886
Oh, Lee Kyung-jin?

34:56.969 --> 35:00.431
Well, she didn't have brains
or rich parents.

35:00.515 --> 35:05.228
But she was very determined
to enroll at our academy.

35:05.311 --> 35:07.647
So she's very goal-oriented.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.483
She has grit and determination.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.402
Who was she close with?

35:13.986 --> 35:15.822
Was she friends with
the other students here?

35:15.905 --> 35:16.739
Friends?

35:17.448 --> 35:18.366
Well…

35:18.449 --> 35:20.576
I'm sorry to say
but nobody makes friends here.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.079
Every student is someone
you have to surpass.

35:23.746 --> 35:26.165
We don't inquire

35:26.249 --> 35:28.292
about their personal lives.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.718
Hello. Are you Ms. Jo Jung-hyun?

35:38.594 --> 35:39.887
Yes. Who are you?

35:40.555 --> 35:41.848
You can't come into the kitchen.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.101
I'm from Youngsung Life Insurance.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.440
YOUNGSUNG LIFE INSURANCE
YOO JUNG-GIL

35:51.524 --> 35:53.860
I came here to ask a few questions.

35:55.027 --> 35:57.071
Do you know Jung Young-seob, by chance?

35:57.738 --> 35:59.615
Yes, we went to high school together.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.826
Have you been in contact
with him recently?

36:03.369 --> 36:05.329
Well, I don't think we ever talked

36:05.830 --> 36:07.540
after we graduated from high school.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.501
So the reason I'm here

36:10.585 --> 36:14.463
is because Jung Young-seop
was involved in a tragic incident.

36:15.047 --> 36:16.591
Are you aware of it?

36:17.800 --> 36:20.428
No. What kind of incident was he in?

36:21.304 --> 36:25.016
He was discovered in an empty lot

36:25.099 --> 36:27.560
near his home with first-degree burns.

36:27.643 --> 36:29.270
According to a witness,

36:29.937 --> 36:31.898
he poured paint thinner on himself

36:31.981 --> 36:33.733
and attempted suicide.

36:39.363 --> 36:42.116
This is all so sudden. I'm very confused.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.785
So Young-seob was severely injured, right?

36:44.869 --> 36:48.623
Yes, we have learned
that he is in critical condition.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.334
Oh my goodness.

36:52.627 --> 36:56.547
I came here to see you

36:56.631 --> 37:00.218
because a week before
he made his suicide attempt,

37:00.301 --> 37:02.553
he contacted
all of his high school friends.

37:03.137 --> 37:06.182
And he said something to all of them.

37:06.849 --> 37:08.559
Do you know about that?

37:09.435 --> 37:11.896
No. This is the first time
I'm hearing this.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.565
What did he say?

37:15.274 --> 37:18.569
I don't know the meaning
of his words either.

37:18.653 --> 37:19.737
Just a second.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.531
Here.

37:23.449 --> 37:26.452
Young-seob mentioned your name

37:27.662 --> 37:29.872
and said these exact words.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.083
The family of "guru" has returned.

37:33.668 --> 37:34.627
Guru?

37:35.169 --> 37:36.379
What does that mean?

37:36.462 --> 37:38.089
Until the promised hour,

37:38.172 --> 37:41.467
the daughter of Guru
will take Guru's place.

37:53.020 --> 37:56.357
Hello. I'm Jo Jae-young,
8th Grade, Class No. 3.

38:07.576 --> 38:09.996
Don't you smell it?

38:11.664 --> 38:12.748
What smell?

38:13.708 --> 38:16.669
A very putrid smell.

38:16.752 --> 38:17.795
Putrid?

38:18.504 --> 38:22.174
Quit talking nonsense.
Let's get to today's agenda.

38:23.759 --> 38:27.680
Now, sisters. Do you agree
to uncover the dirty secrets

38:27.763 --> 38:31.183
of Lee's Genius Academy
through this tape, which was given to us

38:31.267 --> 38:32.435
by an anonymous person?

38:35.396 --> 38:36.689
All right.

38:43.529 --> 38:44.405
Are you ready?

38:49.327 --> 38:51.954
<i>Hello, students.</i>

38:52.913 --> 38:56.208
<i>This is Lee Young-deok
of the Genius Academy.</i>

38:58.669 --> 39:01.130
<i>Are you paying attention</i>

39:01.213 --> 39:05.468
<i>to the sound you're hearing?</i>

39:07.553 --> 39:11.432
<i>This brain enhancing program
provided by our cram school</i>

39:12.183 --> 39:17.188
<i>requires your full participation.</i>

39:18.647 --> 39:22.860
<i>Now, try to focus on
only listening to the sound.</i>

39:23.569 --> 39:28.574
<i>And focus on the image
that appears in your head.</i>

39:29.158 --> 39:30.284
What is this?

39:30.368 --> 39:31.327
<i>What do you see?</i>

39:31.410 --> 39:33.287
I thought it contained exam questions.

39:33.954 --> 39:35.706
I think I know what this is.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.377
It's those brain function
enhancing techniques they sell.

39:40.419 --> 39:42.797
Gosh. What a letdown.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.092
It's a relief to know it doesn't contain
any exam questions.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.426
What do you mean?

39:47.510 --> 39:49.804
Students are paying the academy
for these tapes.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.811
That's a different matter.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.647
These sounds

40:00.731 --> 40:02.650
are so scary.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.028
I agree.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.156
It's making me feel strange.

40:10.282 --> 40:11.575
It's…

40:13.160 --> 40:14.453
quite frightening.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.886
-Who could it be?
-Turn it off.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.808
What are you kids doing here?

40:36.767 --> 40:39.478
We're studying.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.314
Is this place your study room?

40:42.857 --> 40:45.651
I told you not to use
the broadcasting room for that purpose.

40:46.235 --> 40:50.406
We were preparing material
for the show before school begins.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.950
I don't want to hear it.
Pack your bags and go home.

40:54.577 --> 40:55.661
Hurry!

41:08.883 --> 41:09.800
Sir.

41:11.051 --> 41:13.596
Mr. Lee Cheon-seok,
the father of the missing girl is coming

41:13.679 --> 41:14.805
to cooperate with our investigation.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.348
-Okay.
-Got it.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.064
<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>

41:24.148 --> 41:25.566
I don't know

41:26.400 --> 41:28.194
what is going on.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.362
It's like I'm in a nightmare.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.031
If I had…

41:32.656 --> 41:34.825
If I had only come home a minute sooner…

41:36.785 --> 41:38.746
Now you need to be strong.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.956
We need your cooperation

41:41.499 --> 41:43.083
to help us find your daughter.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.628
Okay, sir.

41:46.962 --> 41:49.381
I heard that
you brought something with you.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.050
Oh, yes.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.345
I thought you should listen to this.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.389
I don't know if it'll help,

41:57.890 --> 41:59.517
but it might be relevant though.

42:02.478 --> 42:03.771
What is on it?

42:04.939 --> 42:07.024
Since I got on business trips frequently,

42:07.775 --> 42:10.736
my daughter made this mixtape
for me to listen to.

42:10.819 --> 42:12.488
-A mixtape?
-Yes.

42:12.571 --> 42:13.739
What is on this?

42:15.241 --> 42:19.245
She chooses songs
and records them onto an empty cassette.

42:19.328 --> 42:22.039
Making mixtapes is popular at school.

42:22.122 --> 42:23.624
That's what my daughter told me.

42:24.250 --> 42:27.211
Classmates give them to
each other like giving letters.

42:27.294 --> 42:29.964
-It's what they do for fun.
-Oh, really?

42:30.714 --> 42:34.468
But why did you bring this to us?

42:34.552 --> 42:36.136
Well, the thing is,

42:36.762 --> 42:39.807
my daughter used to record a voice message

42:39.890 --> 42:41.684
at the beginning of the tape.

42:42.268 --> 42:44.770
Since I go on business trips so often,

42:44.853 --> 42:49.817
she recorded what is going on
in her life in those messages.

42:50.693 --> 42:51.652
But

42:52.278 --> 42:55.739
the message she left
on the last mixtape she gave me

42:56.740 --> 42:58.200
was a bit strange.

42:58.867 --> 43:00.786
So it was bothering me a little.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.121
That's why…

43:02.204 --> 43:03.789
It was strange?

43:04.915 --> 43:06.000
Yes.

43:06.875 --> 43:10.170
I think you should listen to it first.

43:17.595 --> 43:18.679
Aunt.

43:19.638 --> 43:21.932
-What?
-I have something to say.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.434
Oh, sorry.

43:31.066 --> 43:32.318
Actually,

43:33.944 --> 43:35.988
there's something I didn’t tell you.

43:37.740 --> 43:38.991
What is it?

43:44.455 --> 43:45.539
Well…

43:52.379 --> 43:53.380
Could you

43:54.214 --> 43:55.549
just wait for a day?

43:58.677 --> 44:01.764
It's important to you
that I wait for a day, right?

44:02.389 --> 44:03.349
Yes.

44:05.267 --> 44:08.020
What about telling me something today
that you were going to tell me tomorrow?

44:09.813 --> 44:12.524
I don't like keeping secrets

44:13.525 --> 44:14.526
from you, Aunt.

44:18.197 --> 44:21.283
It's okay. Everyone has secrets.

44:23.535 --> 44:24.620
Really?

44:25.871 --> 44:27.581
Do you have a lot of secrets
you're not telling me?

44:31.627 --> 44:32.961
Yea, I have a lot.

44:34.213 --> 44:35.297
You didn't know?

44:39.051 --> 44:41.887
Why do you have so many secrets?

44:51.772 --> 44:53.065
<i>Hi Dad.</i>

44:53.607 --> 44:55.984
<i>It's already my eighth mixtape.</i>

44:56.068 --> 45:00.781
<i>I like it that I'm able to tell you
my stories like this.</i>

45:01.448 --> 45:03.242
<i>You can listen to my music</i>

45:03.325 --> 45:05.702
<i>and I can tell you some secrets I have.</i>

45:05.786 --> 45:07.329
<i>I do have a few.</i>

45:07.413 --> 45:08.747
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

45:09.540 --> 45:11.250
<i>let me tell you a secret.</i>

45:11.333 --> 45:14.086
<i>You know Jo Jae-young, right?
I mentioned her once.</i>

45:14.169 --> 45:15.921
<i>Her family runs a Chinese restaurant.</i>

45:16.463 --> 45:18.382
<i>She transferred to our school last month.</i>

45:19.133 --> 45:20.259
<i>But</i>

45:20.926 --> 45:24.471
<i>I heard a shocking story about her.</i>

45:25.264 --> 45:26.682
<i>Don't be shocked when I tell you this.</i>

45:27.766 --> 45:29.351
<i>You know, Dad.</i>

45:30.394 --> 45:31.562
<i>She's…</i>

45:32.938 --> 45:34.356
<i>the daughter of Jo Kyung-ho.</i>

45:35.983 --> 45:38.485
<i>You know, the man
behind the Saju station gas attack.</i>

45:39.611 --> 45:41.113
<i>Isn't that shocking?</i>

45:41.947 --> 45:43.574
<i>It's crazy, isn't it?</i>

45:45.033 --> 45:46.410
<i>I go to a school</i>

45:47.035 --> 45:49.413
<i>with the daughter of a mass murderer, Dad.</i>

45:50.330 --> 45:53.333
<i>How is this even possible?</i>

45:58.505 --> 46:03.135
SAJU STATION TERRORIST ATTACK SUSPECT
JO KYUNG-HO ARRESTED

46:03.218 --> 46:05.596
OVER 200 CASUALTIES
IN SAJU STATION GAS ATTACK

46:14.771 --> 46:16.231
In 1987,

46:17.691 --> 46:19.318
one day before the Chuseok Holiday…

46:21.195 --> 46:23.363
a crazy man called Jo Kyung-ho

46:25.073 --> 46:28.577
released nerve gas at Saju Train Station
in a terrorist attack.

46:31.705 --> 46:33.790
He concealed
nerve gas canisters in four briefcases

46:34.374 --> 46:38.420
and set them around the restroom
and the waiting room.

46:39.463 --> 46:40.923
It was a chemical attack

46:41.882 --> 46:43.509
using nerve gas

46:45.719 --> 46:46.803
that was simultaneously released.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.515
The train station was always crowded,

46:49.598 --> 46:53.018
but it was compounded by the holiday.
It was the worst terrorist act

46:54.019 --> 46:55.270
in the country

46:56.480 --> 46:58.232
with over 200 casualties.

46:59.399 --> 47:02.819
When the nerve gas
was released into the air,

47:02.903 --> 47:05.364
there were a few people
who ran out wearing gas masks

47:05.447 --> 47:07.032
according to witnesses.

47:07.866 --> 47:09.993
Since there were
no security cameras back then,

47:11.328 --> 47:13.830
the police didn't have
any leads on the case.

47:15.249 --> 47:16.625
They couldn't even

47:17.209 --> 47:19.545
compile any suspects
who could have pulled it off.

47:21.338 --> 47:22.297
If…

47:23.799 --> 47:25.926
Jo Kyung-ho had not turned himself in,

47:26.885 --> 47:29.846
the case would have
arguably remained unresolved.

47:30.597 --> 47:33.308
The investigators had no clues
whatsoever to work with.

47:45.112 --> 47:46.488
It's in the report, right?

47:48.949 --> 47:50.993
A week after the gas attack,

47:52.160 --> 47:54.788
he walked into a police station
and confessed to the crime.

47:55.497 --> 47:57.958
He had finished his studies in Japan

47:58.625 --> 48:00.002
and about two months

48:00.919 --> 48:03.630
upon returning to his hometown,
he committed the attack.

48:03.714 --> 48:06.675
He did it against people
in his own hometown.

48:08.176 --> 48:09.428
And you were a detective

48:10.596 --> 48:13.849
in the violent crime division
at the time, weren't you?

48:13.932 --> 48:15.434
Yes, that's correct.

48:15.517 --> 48:17.436
Then you must have been
involved in the case.

48:17.978 --> 48:19.813
No, I wasn't.

48:19.896 --> 48:21.398
I had a personal matter.

48:22.482 --> 48:23.483
I see.

48:25.235 --> 48:27.613
Do you mind telling us
what the personal matter was?

48:36.538 --> 48:37.789
My wife…

48:40.626 --> 48:42.794
was one of the casualties
in the gas attack.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.047
Pardon?

48:55.265 --> 48:57.809
I'm sorry.
It happened such a long time ago

48:58.435 --> 49:00.354
that it wasn't included in this report.

49:02.356 --> 49:04.900
I apologize for asking you that question.

49:05.400 --> 49:06.568
It's all right.

49:08.070 --> 49:10.280
You're a prosecutor.
You don't have to apologize.

49:55.242 --> 49:56.368
Oh gosh.

50:00.163 --> 50:01.915
It's raining hard.

50:01.998 --> 50:04.710
My shoes got all wet.

50:12.217 --> 50:13.176
Thank you.

50:14.094 --> 50:16.847
Did your dog sleep well last night?

50:17.723 --> 50:19.641
I don't know. I didn't check.

50:19.725 --> 50:22.644
Oh gosh. He didn't eat
his food last night.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.938
So I brought some steaks for him.

50:25.897 --> 50:27.190
By the way,

50:27.274 --> 50:29.693
aren't you going to say bye to him?

50:31.945 --> 50:33.989
You don't have to update me
when he gets sick.

50:34.823 --> 50:36.116
Oh, okay.

50:36.199 --> 50:38.493
But if he happens to die,

50:39.494 --> 50:40.871
then give me a call.

50:49.421 --> 50:50.672
Oh gosh.

50:53.341 --> 50:54.676
Aly.

50:57.137 --> 50:59.055
Did you sleep well?

50:59.139 --> 51:00.640
Oh gosh.

51:01.141 --> 51:02.934
Oh, sweetie.

51:13.653 --> 51:14.654
Aunt.

51:20.494 --> 51:23.538
<i>I have to go somewhere today.
So I can't give you a ride to school.</i>

51:23.622 --> 51:26.082
<i>It's because you didn't tell me
your secret yesterday.</i>

51:26.166 --> 51:29.002
<i>But I'll pick you up after school.</i>

51:40.347 --> 51:43.058
PATIENT'S NAME: JUNG YOUNG-SEOB

51:54.486 --> 51:55.362
Hello.

51:56.112 --> 51:57.197
Who are you?

51:57.781 --> 51:59.658
I'm a friend of Young-seob.

51:59.741 --> 52:02.202
Oh, I see.

52:02.285 --> 52:04.496
I thought you were a friend.

52:05.872 --> 52:08.041
It must be a shock to see him like this.

52:08.917 --> 52:12.087
Hey, so many of your friends have come.

52:13.588 --> 52:16.091
Please open your eyes.

52:18.677 --> 52:21.221
Please open your eyes.

52:38.697 --> 52:42.367
Young-seob had a fiancee a few years back.

52:43.535 --> 52:45.579
-It didn't work out?
-No.

52:46.162 --> 52:47.873
She died in a car accident.

52:48.999 --> 52:52.377
Young-seob went abroad after that.

52:52.460 --> 52:54.754
He returned to Korea just a few years ago.

52:58.091 --> 52:59.801
I didn't know.

52:59.885 --> 53:01.636
He's had a rough time.

53:04.306 --> 53:08.768
But he called me out of the blue
a few weeks ago.

53:08.852 --> 53:11.605
He asked if I had the school magazine
we published together.

53:12.188 --> 53:13.940
-School magazine?
-Yes.

53:14.024 --> 53:15.525
I told him I still had it.

53:15.609 --> 53:18.778
Then he asked me
if I could give my copy to him.

53:18.862 --> 53:22.365
So I was supposed to meet him.

53:22.449 --> 53:24.910
But then a few days later,
he did that to himself.

53:27.871 --> 53:30.665
Did Young-seob mention anything else?

53:30.749 --> 53:32.834
Something about "Guru?"

53:32.918 --> 53:33.919
No.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.671
Guru? What does that word mean?

53:38.590 --> 53:39.591
Nothing.

53:40.175 --> 53:42.093
I'd like to see the school magazine too.

53:42.177 --> 53:43.595
You lost yours?

53:45.263 --> 53:46.598
I don't know where I put it.

53:46.681 --> 53:49.809
We worked so hard to publish it together.

53:49.893 --> 53:51.561
And you lost it like that?

53:53.939 --> 53:58.318
Anyway, it's nice to see you again.
Life must have been hard for you.

53:59.736 --> 54:00.904
No.

54:01.947 --> 54:03.823
You must have had a harder time.

54:04.783 --> 54:07.369
I didn't know your mom was sick.

54:09.788 --> 54:11.998
My mom is also staying at this hospital.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.376
I come here every day.

54:19.005 --> 54:20.882
I hope she'll get better soon.

54:21.883 --> 54:22.968
Yes.

54:23.593 --> 54:28.473
I think she'll wake up
from her coma one day.

54:29.057 --> 54:32.227
That's what I've been hoping for
these last few years.

54:34.104 --> 54:36.064
I have to try whatever I can.

54:37.565 --> 54:38.775
Of course.

54:41.361 --> 54:42.862
Oh, there you are.

54:42.946 --> 54:45.323
We've been looking for you two everywhere.

54:45.407 --> 54:46.366
What is going on?

54:46.449 --> 54:49.911
Jung Young-seob went into shock.
He's in critical condition.

54:52.789 --> 54:54.332
Bring the AED right now.

54:56.001 --> 54:56.960
Please move aside.

55:02.882 --> 55:04.801
-Prepare for it.
-Oh, my son…

55:07.762 --> 55:09.222
Please save my son…

55:23.945 --> 55:26.281
Hey, did Lee Kyung-jin miss school today?

55:26.364 --> 55:27.365
How did you know that?

55:27.949 --> 55:30.243
She didn't come, right? What should we do?

55:30.326 --> 55:32.078
I think that's true.

55:32.162 --> 55:33.455
What's true?

55:33.538 --> 55:35.832
They say she went missing.

55:35.915 --> 55:36.916
What did you say?

55:37.500 --> 55:39.461
What's scary is that…

55:40.670 --> 55:41.713
Well,

55:42.505 --> 55:44.841
I don't know if I should say this.

55:44.924 --> 55:46.426
Why not? Is it something scary?

55:47.177 --> 55:48.470
I'm not certain about it.

55:48.553 --> 55:49.929
Then I don't want to hear it.

55:50.013 --> 55:52.474
Listen to it. Just listen.

55:53.850 --> 55:57.187
A few days ago, her mother died.

55:58.063 --> 56:00.356
She was killed in her home.

56:01.107 --> 56:04.069
And Kyung-jin went missing after that.

56:04.152 --> 56:06.446
-So she could…
-Hey. Don't say anything.

56:06.529 --> 56:07.906
It's impossible.

56:07.989 --> 56:10.909
My uncle's friend is a police officer.

56:10.992 --> 56:14.079
He says the police are busy
working on the case.

56:14.162 --> 56:17.957
It might be reported on the news tomorrow.

56:22.295 --> 56:24.089
Are you okay, Jae-young?

56:25.757 --> 56:27.133
Yes.

56:27.217 --> 56:29.969
I have a stomachache.

56:30.053 --> 56:31.930
You do? How does it hurt?

56:32.639 --> 56:34.015
I'll take you to the nurse.

56:34.099 --> 56:35.350
No, I'm okay.

56:36.684 --> 56:38.978
I need to use the restroom.

56:39.062 --> 56:40.647
Go on eating your lunch.

56:50.532 --> 56:53.701
Do you think Jae-young got shocked
by what I said?

56:53.785 --> 56:55.662
It's not just her.

56:56.162 --> 56:57.997
I'm scared too after hearing your story.

56:58.581 --> 57:00.500
Nothing is for certain.

57:00.583 --> 57:02.127
You've got a big mouth.

57:02.210 --> 57:04.963
Why are you blaming me?
I'm just telling you what I heard.

57:06.756 --> 57:08.925
Even though Kyung-jin is a mean girl,

57:10.552 --> 57:11.845
I'm worried about her.

57:26.067 --> 57:28.278
Are you Ms. Jo Jung-hyun?

57:29.237 --> 57:33.116
-Yes.
-When the patient was awake,

57:33.199 --> 57:35.160
he asked to see you.

57:35.243 --> 57:37.078
-Me?
-Yes.

57:37.162 --> 57:39.622
He asked about today's date.

57:39.706 --> 57:42.709
And said the same thing over
while mentioning your name.

57:47.464 --> 57:48.381
What did he say?

57:49.716 --> 57:50.967
He said

57:51.718 --> 57:52.927
you couldn't be here.

57:54.179 --> 57:55.138
Pardon?

57:56.639 --> 57:58.600
He said if you were here,

57:58.683 --> 58:01.394
you'd put another person in danger.

58:01.478 --> 58:03.813
That name was…

58:03.897 --> 58:05.023
It was Cho something.

58:06.816 --> 58:08.151
Oh, I remember now.

58:08.234 --> 58:09.486
Jo Jae-young.

58:11.446 --> 58:13.323
He said if you stay here,

58:13.406 --> 58:16.451
Jo Jae-young would be in danger.

58:43.019 --> 58:44.312
Which classroom is she in?

58:44.979 --> 58:47.607
I don't know that.
Her name is Jo Jae-young.

58:48.566 --> 58:49.734
Hi Hwan-gyu.

58:50.443 --> 58:51.361
Hi Jae-young.

58:53.404 --> 58:54.447
Do you know him?

58:55.448 --> 58:56.449
Yes.

58:57.075 --> 59:00.078
Is it okay for you to be here
during class?

59:02.247 --> 59:04.624
I'm sorry. I think there's an emergency.

59:04.707 --> 59:05.875
Isn't that so, Hwan-gyu?

59:05.959 --> 59:07.335
Yes, it is.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.129
Let's go. Can you come now?

59:11.965 --> 59:14.676
Did something happen to Aunt or Grandma?

59:15.552 --> 59:17.637
Get on. I'll tell you on the way.

59:27.814 --> 59:28.982
Aunt.

59:29.566 --> 59:32.527
-Hello.
-Hi Moon-sook. Did you see Jae-young?

59:32.610 --> 59:33.987
She went home early.

59:34.070 --> 59:36.030
She didn't call you?

59:36.739 --> 59:38.866
She left early? Do you know when she left?

59:40.660 --> 59:44.747
She didn't come to class after lunch.

59:44.831 --> 59:46.332
That's strange.

59:46.416 --> 59:48.293
I heard that she got a ride
on a motorcycle.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.920
A motorcycle? What kind of motorcycle?

59:51.588 --> 59:54.632
She went to see the school nurse
because she had a stomachache.

59:54.716 --> 59:58.094
Someone riding a Sook Chinese restaurant
delivery bike came to pick her up.

59:58.886 --> 1:00:01.806
So I thought that was you.

1:00:06.060 --> 1:00:08.229
After the first victim was found,

1:00:09.939 --> 1:00:12.358
the victim's daughter,
Lee Kyung-jin went missing.

1:00:14.652 --> 1:00:16.112
Exactly three days later,

1:00:17.488 --> 1:00:19.949
Jo Jae-young went missing too.

1:00:21.993 --> 1:00:23.494
In retrospect,

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:27.832
I think I should have thought

1:00:27.915 --> 1:00:31.461
more about
what Lee Kyung-jin's disappearance meant

1:00:32.503 --> 1:00:34.505
and even Jo Jae-young's missing case.

1:00:37.467 --> 1:00:40.428
I regret that.

1:00:42.013 --> 1:00:43.514
What do you mean?

1:01:02.533 --> 1:01:04.202
You can be frank.

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:06.788
Jo Kyung-ho.

1:01:07.747 --> 1:01:09.123
You and I

1:01:10.750 --> 1:01:13.086
are sitting here talking
because of Jo Kyung-ho.

1:01:18.466 --> 1:01:21.678
Sir, I think we should shut the door.

1:01:33.356 --> 1:01:34.440
Can you handle this?

1:01:39.445 --> 1:01:40.571
What I tell you next

1:01:41.906 --> 1:01:45.993
is classified information.

1:02:02.176 --> 1:02:03.594
Shall I begin?

1:02:05.471 --> 1:02:07.515
You can begin anytime you want.

1:02:12.186 --> 1:02:13.730
Where should I start?

1:02:16.733 --> 1:02:21.195
You can talk about what you remember
from the beginning.

1:02:21.279 --> 1:02:22.947
The beginning?

1:02:25.366 --> 1:02:26.868
So I guess

1:02:28.202 --> 1:02:30.955
that would mean the day I was born?

1:02:36.252 --> 1:02:40.631
I think we should begin talking
about Jo Jae-young.

1:02:42.842 --> 1:02:46.262
Oh, that's what you think?
I should begin with her, Jae-young?

1:02:52.602 --> 1:02:54.687
I haven't done this before.

1:02:55.313 --> 1:02:58.608
So it could take a while
to get to the heart of the matter.

1:02:58.691 --> 1:03:00.067
Is that okay?

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:04.739
You don't have to worry about anything.

1:03:04.822 --> 1:03:06.365
I remember every detail,

1:03:07.950 --> 1:03:10.953
so you won't find it boring.

1:03:17.460 --> 1:03:19.170
You can't extract anything

1:03:20.671 --> 1:03:22.799
if you don't believe what he's saying.

1:03:23.674 --> 1:03:25.968
But if you believe everything he says,

1:03:27.595 --> 1:03:30.264
you'll lose your balance
at the most critical moment.

1:03:33.768 --> 1:03:35.353
Like I did back then.

1:03:38.689 --> 1:03:40.358
I heard about Jae-young

1:03:42.109 --> 1:03:45.404
from one of the prison guards
that I talk to sometimes.

1:03:46.739 --> 1:03:49.617
So it happened

1:03:49.700 --> 1:03:52.537
about a week after
the news report about her was aired.

1:03:54.330 --> 1:03:57.333
After I learned of her disappearance,

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.127
I waited for a week to hear
any news about her.

1:04:01.420 --> 1:04:03.506
And I was given a few newspaper articles.

1:04:03.589 --> 1:04:06.717
They were about
the ongoing search for her.

1:04:07.969 --> 1:04:10.805
Most of it was worthless reading.

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:14.517
But I read it over and over.

1:04:16.018 --> 1:04:19.272
I read the Saju Daily article
about her case

1:04:20.773 --> 1:04:22.608
so many times

1:04:23.734 --> 1:04:26.279
that it felt like

1:04:27.488 --> 1:04:30.032
I was at the scene of the crime.

1:04:35.663 --> 1:04:37.498
Rain falling on a forest…

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:42.336
Big raindrops hitting the leaves…

1:04:43.921 --> 1:04:45.756
<i>The wet soil…</i>

1:04:47.508 --> 1:04:49.844
<i>The sound of water hitting the stream…</i>

1:04:56.601 --> 1:04:59.854
But then I hear a piercing sound
that breaks the silence.

1:05:01.731 --> 1:05:03.524
It's a familiar sound

1:05:03.608 --> 1:05:06.027
but not a sound from nature.

1:05:07.528 --> 1:05:09.071
A phone ringtone.

1:05:10.698 --> 1:05:13.701
<i>I imagined the discarded phone
laying on the black soil.</i>

1:05:15.578 --> 1:05:19.415
<i>The police barely found the phone</i>

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:22.627
<i>half a day after she went missing.</i>

1:05:24.462 --> 1:05:27.048
<i>I could see Jae-young's phone
getting wet in the rain.</i>

1:05:32.386 --> 1:05:34.388
<i>That's all I could think about every day.</i>

1:06:04.377 --> 1:06:05.753
<i>Jae-young…</i>

1:06:06.462 --> 1:06:08.965
I'll give my life if I have to
in order to find her.

1:06:09.048 --> 1:06:12.551
Could it be a serial killer
that we're dealing with?

1:06:13.678 --> 1:06:17.473
Actually,
she said her dad still contacts her.

1:06:17.556 --> 1:06:18.975
<i>You have no idea.</i>

1:06:19.058 --> 1:06:22.144
I'm conducting a very complex experiment.

1:06:22.228 --> 1:06:24.981
If it's okay with you,
let me listen to that tape too.

1:06:28.234 --> 1:06:29.735
<i>The thing I completely forgot about…</i>

1:06:31.404 --> 1:06:32.446
<i>was this.</i>

1:06:34.699 --> 1:06:39.453
