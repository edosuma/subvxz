WEBVTT

00:12.095 --> 00:15.348
We're losing! Goddamn it!
Do something!

00:16.975 --> 00:18.727
Get yourselves together and listen!

00:19.394 --> 00:22.105
Let's try something.
Take three steps up when I signal.

00:22.188 --> 00:25.025
Up? What now? But that's the edge!

00:25.567 --> 00:27.068
Look, just trust me and they'll fall!

00:27.152 --> 00:28.611
There's no way I'll do that!

00:28.695 --> 00:30.030
We might as well try!

00:30.113 --> 00:31.865
No way! I can't do it!

00:31.948 --> 00:33.616
Move up or you'll die!

00:33.700 --> 00:35.243
On count of three!

00:35.326 --> 00:37.162
One! Two!

00:37.245 --> 00:38.913
Three!

00:40.665 --> 00:42.876
Oh!

00:46.713 --> 00:47.839
Pull now!

01:15.492 --> 01:17.202
Pull back more, you idiots!

02:27.063 --> 02:30.733
EPISODE 5
A FAIR WORLD

02:49.836 --> 02:51.713
Oh, Lord, protect me.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.381
Hey, dude.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.301
Who you think you're praying to, huh?

02:57.635 --> 02:58.553
To God?

03:00.930 --> 03:03.391
You think you made it out of there
because of God, don't you?

03:09.689 --> 03:13.151
The reason you're still breathing
and thanking that nice God of yours…

03:13.860 --> 03:15.361
is that old man there.

03:16.487 --> 03:20.825
And that guy over there who came up
with that awesome last-minute trick.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.621
You know if there's anybody
that you should be thanking

03:25.413 --> 03:27.081
it's them, not God.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.669
You sad lost soul.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.130
What would you say about everybody
who was nailed to the cross

03:34.214 --> 03:35.506
for our salvation today?

03:36.132 --> 03:39.510
They sacrificed themselves for us.
We are here, thanks to their blood.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.972
I pray to the Lord
on behalf of all us sinners.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.682
I gave thanks for their sacrifice.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.893
God made a decision to help our team win.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.519
That's why we're all here.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.646
Bullshit.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.690
You killed those guys out there.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.444
Oh!

03:57.070 --> 03:59.530
If we say some prayers,
do we all get to go to heaven?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.408
I should really pray too
if that's how easy it is.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.661
Our God who art in Heaven,

04:04.744 --> 04:07.038
we worked as a team
to send people to your side.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.957
And we sent a bunch of them today.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.960
And please help us
with a whole lot more to be with you.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.045
-And I hope that from now on--
-Be quiet!

04:19.092 --> 04:19.968
Me?

04:20.718 --> 04:21.803
Or you mean that guy?

04:21.886 --> 04:23.137
Everyone.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.702
What's your name, huh?

04:46.494 --> 04:48.162
Why do you care about that?

04:48.705 --> 04:50.540
So I can use your name, duh!

04:50.623 --> 04:51.708
It doesn't matter.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.876
So secretive.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.629
Listen, okay.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.756
Just leave me alone.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.385
Well, you're the one
who asked me to join you guys.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.352
Did you see that bald guy
wet his pants like a little baby?

05:11.436 --> 05:14.439
Kids just keep blaming him how…

06:55.456 --> 06:58.251
He's not breathing.
Go get that doctor.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.426
You know what? I really thought
we were going to die out there.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.846
And then, as soon as we're all
leaning back, I felt so powerful.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.431
Like, "Whoa! It works. Is this real?"

07:11.514 --> 07:13.391
Hey, old man, how do you know that?

07:14.559 --> 07:17.437
-As a kid, I would always--
-Oh, you copied that one thing.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.814
From that movie. What's it called?

07:19.897 --> 07:21.566
The guy who dodges bullets like this.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.567
-Right?
-Matrix.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.403
Hmm.

07:26.487 --> 07:30.074
Hey, when you got to Korea,
is all you did watch movies?

07:32.493 --> 07:33.744
And our man…

07:34.245 --> 07:37.248
"Everybody, three steps up when I signal."

07:37.331 --> 07:40.334
Oh. My God, I can't believe
how cool that was.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.670
How did you come up with it
under all that pressure?

07:42.753 --> 07:44.297
Earlier, you were the one who said no.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.550
Yeah?

07:48.092 --> 07:49.302
Was that what you heard?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.595
You cried and said,

07:50.678 --> 07:53.973
"But that's the edge.
There's no way I'll go."

07:54.056 --> 07:54.932
Like that.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.728
Hey, you. You got a visa? I bet you don't.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.646
You're an illegal alien.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.690
Hey, boys, how about it?

08:02.773 --> 08:05.151
Why keep the strange foreigner
when we could just ditch him?

08:05.234 --> 08:07.528
Our team's more secure that way, huh?

08:07.612 --> 08:10.781
Guess I'd better do some major
restructuring while I'm here.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.533
Who's captain here, guys?

08:14.285 --> 08:17.121
Mr. Brains, you've been captain, right?

08:17.663 --> 08:20.750
There's no captain. We're all equal here.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.919
Ah! That's great.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.755
Building an egalitarian society!

08:26.672 --> 08:28.216
Damn, guys.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.593
I gotta say this is quite a change
from that huge asshole

08:30.676 --> 08:33.221
who just bosses you around
and pretend he's king.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.431
Oh, about that, grandma,
why did you get kicked out?

08:37.475 --> 08:38.976
Grandma?

08:39.060 --> 08:41.312
Don't you ever call me that!

08:42.730 --> 08:45.066
Here, Han Mi-nyeo.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.360
Got it? Mi-nyeo. That's my name.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.780
And I didn't get kicked out.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.782
I made the decision to go, all right?

08:52.865 --> 08:56.369
Those crazy thugs there?
You can't lock me in with that crew.

08:56.452 --> 08:57.870
They only got rid of you,

08:57.954 --> 09:00.039
then they only wound up with male players.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.749
Right before the game at that.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.835
You know, it's almost like
they knew about it ahead of time.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.220
Players,
your bedtime will begin in 30 minutes.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.181
Please return to your assigned beds
and prepare for lights-out.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.934
Another fight
could break out like last night.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.143
We should make a plan.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.937
What can we do, huh?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.897
We've got three girls and old man and us.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.649
Our team is the weakest one in here.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.485
We should choose a weak team
and go after them first.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.282
For a resident priest,
you sure are bloodthirsty.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.033
I mean, everybody's hands are bloody.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.870
We're all sinners,
but we're still here, aren't we?

09:41.956 --> 09:44.792
Attacking is our best option.
So I think that's our plan.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.669
During the fight last night,

09:47.920 --> 09:50.298
the man in the bed
in front of me got killed.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.218
And the person he thought
was on his side broke his neck.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.305
Do you trust me then?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.225
I don't trust one person here.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.522
All right.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.025
I think let's still do something.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.818
Before the lights go out,

10:10.901 --> 10:12.403
let's create a barricade.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.448
It might be good to make sure
that we have cover.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.741
Mm-hm.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.103
Hey, Ssangmun-dong.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.609
Hey, I appreciate the work you're doing.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.111
Nice.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.280
But do you think these will do anything?

10:57.114 --> 10:59.575
We can get through all of this easily.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.411
You're not worried at all?

11:03.829 --> 11:06.415
Those scumbags you got
on your side over there?

11:07.124 --> 11:08.125
They're people you trust?

11:15.966 --> 11:17.510
Go. Come on.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.220
If that was me there…

11:22.348 --> 11:24.141
once the fighting starts to happen,

11:25.226 --> 11:27.228
you'll be the first person I'd go for.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.400
You're the strongest person here.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.244
What…

11:50.459 --> 11:51.377
Boss.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.921
So who's our first target, huh?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.339
Let's take the night off.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.091
How come?

11:57.967 --> 12:00.636
-I mean shouldn't we try to cut down the--
-Do what I tell you to do.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.346
Oh.

12:02.888 --> 12:03.723
Sure.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.392
Hey.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.729
Cut that out. We all need to rest tonight.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.153
Where'd the doc go?

12:17.737 --> 12:21.574
He just left. He went to the restroom
while you're gone.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.783
They'll shut off the lights soon.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.659
They might not all come right away.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.829
So we better swap out who's gonna
keep watch, just to be safe, I think.

13:08.913 --> 13:09.997
No, two of us should watch.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.292
A pair can keep each other awake.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.378
Just one person might go leave
and betray our team.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.299
I can…

13:21.133 --> 13:22.468
be first watch then.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.638
You don't really sleep a lot
when you're old.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.848
Excuse me, but are we just
supposed to trust

13:27.932 --> 13:30.643
an old man like you
to not sleep on the job all night?

13:32.645 --> 13:35.397
Let me go first.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.319
I'm not tired yet.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.321
I'll go with you.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.824
Then I'll be next.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.368
You wake me up the second you get tired.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.955
Then why don't I join you on second watch?

13:51.455 --> 13:53.374
Assuming that's okay with you.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.668
Yeah, that sounds good.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.352
The work schedule is done for today.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.772
All active staff,
please return to your rooms immediately.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.862
I repeat. Active staff,
please return to your rooms immediately.

14:43.632 --> 14:44.675
Have some of this.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.387
I saved this earlier
when they gave it to us for supper.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.472
So I could give it to you.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.349
Give it to me. What'd I do?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.561
Today, you saved my life.
It's that simple.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.355
I wanted to thank you.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.732
I'm flattered but…

15:00.608 --> 15:01.859
I just didn't wanna die.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.986
You gave me that money for the bus too.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.781
I just wanted to return the favor.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.957
Your share.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.466
It's Ali. Is that right?

15:26.342 --> 15:27.384
How old are you?

15:28.802 --> 15:30.930
Ali, yes. I'm 33, mister.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.933
Just call me Sang-woo, okay?

15:35.517 --> 15:36.644
You sure about that…

15:37.937 --> 15:38.938
Sang-woo?

15:45.986 --> 15:47.071
How did you get here?

15:48.072 --> 15:50.032
I came to Korea to make money,

15:50.741 --> 15:52.034
Sang-woo.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.411
I don't mean that. In here.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.246
The game.

15:57.706 --> 15:58.916
I needed money.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.834
I came for that.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.966
Got family?

16:10.469 --> 16:14.682
Pakistan. Got my dad and mother
and siblings there.

16:16.350 --> 16:20.104
I still had to take the wife and baby
with me here.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.188
You're a father?

16:23.190 --> 16:24.233
How old is your kid?

16:24.733 --> 16:25.985
He's a year-old boy.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.656
You miss them a lot?

16:32.908 --> 16:33.909
Yes.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.541
What's your reason for being…

16:41.834 --> 16:42.835
in here?

16:47.339 --> 16:48.549
The same as you.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.718
For money.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.091
29, what happened yesterday?

17:31.175 --> 17:32.259
Where were you?

17:33.969 --> 17:35.012
Sorry.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.347
"Sorry"?

17:39.475 --> 17:42.478
I stopped the other guys from killing you
because they didn't trust you.

17:43.854 --> 17:47.733
Since you saved my life
during the last dive, we're even now.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.237
If you do that again, you're out.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.396
Number 29. So you're finally here.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.649
I gave him a warning.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.859
We couldn't make the delivery last night.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.820
We can't let it slide with only a warning!

18:32.903 --> 18:34.988
Then you can deliver this yourself.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.284
You think it's easy
to find divers like us in this place?

18:39.368 --> 18:42.162
Make sure tonight's
delivery goes off without a hitch.

18:50.337 --> 18:53.006
What?
You aren't even done with one?

18:53.090 --> 18:56.093
The doctor is slow today.
More so than usual.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.220
Hey, quack. Hurry it up.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.764
This is all pointless
if the boat leaves before we deliver.

19:01.348 --> 19:05.018
You come over here and try doing this,
especially when you're sleep deprived.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.730
I'm just barely escaping death
every damn day.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.705
That's why we tell you
what the games are beforehand

19:24.788 --> 19:26.665
and gave that extra food.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.020
Gi-hun.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.188
Huh? Sang-woo.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.565
-You ready to switch?
-Ah…

19:53.066 --> 19:54.067
Okay.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.574
-Are you okay?
-Huh?

20:01.241 --> 20:03.452
Looked like you were having
a nightmare just now.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.330
Oh, no, no. It's all good.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.374
Hey.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.002
What are you doing up?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.965
I can't keep my eyes shut.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.052
Well, you should really try
to get some rest.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.179
I'll keep everybody safe tonight.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.725
Glad you got our backs tonight, kid.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.146
Heard from the doctor yet?

20:31.230 --> 20:34.566
No. This is weird.
He's taking too long.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.864
Hold this.

20:44.534 --> 20:47.663
We're in a hurry.
Maybe I should try working on those?

20:47.746 --> 20:51.124
I bet I could do it
if you teach me a few tricks.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.669
Yeah. You think all of this
is so simple, huh.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.047
I saw on the news
doctors don't always perform surgeries.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.466
Sometimes it's the office managers
or nurse's aides.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.719
And some of them are better
than the doctors are.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.930
You think you know so much?
Then how about you try?

21:05.973 --> 21:08.767
Who would have thought
a quack who killed his own patient

21:08.850 --> 21:10.852
would still be so proud about his work?

21:11.353 --> 21:14.648
If you were so good, how come you ruined
the eyes you pulled out last time?

21:14.731 --> 21:16.817
Those Chinese guys busted my ass!

21:16.900 --> 21:18.443
Listen, I'll tell you what went wrong.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.987
That thing was still alive
when I got here.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.739
How'd you expect me to operate
with all of that struggling?

21:22.823 --> 21:24.574
We don't have time for this.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.368
The boat will be here soon.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.793
Gi-hun.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.599
Hey.

22:34.269 --> 22:37.272
So, uh, what's going on? Are you okay?

22:38.106 --> 22:41.818
I thought you were sleeping
with your eyes open.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.029
Um…

22:45.072 --> 22:46.782
Thinking of the old days.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.325
The old days, huh?

22:49.659 --> 22:53.205
I worked at this place once
where we went on strike.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.376
Had a barricade just like this one.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.545
What did you do
when you were working there?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.714
I used to make parts for cars.

23:02.798 --> 23:05.175
Hmm. Ah.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.135
Why did you strike?

23:07.844 --> 23:10.389
They fired a bunch of us all at once.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.518
I've been employed there
more than a decade.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.356
I bet it wasn't easy.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.530
I had a kid on the way too.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.741
I couldn't afford to get fired like that.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.830
Our bosses said we couldn't stay.
I had no other option.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.543
They ruined the company
and held us responsible.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.546
It made me furious.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.550
And everyone same as now…

23:47.634 --> 23:49.886
…all kept watching in pairs until morning.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.972
That way, no one could kick us all out.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.893
And we were all so scared.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.063
Police might come any second.

24:00.147 --> 24:03.150
I remember. I heard about it back then.

24:04.526 --> 24:08.196
There was a huge strike.
Some car company. That's right.

24:09.531 --> 24:13.869
I think the news turned it
into this crazy story.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.998
That was it.
Someone died there too, right?

24:18.915 --> 24:20.667
Mmm.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.627
I'm sorry.

24:23.545 --> 24:24.880
My goodness.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.673
I don't know…

24:27.841 --> 24:29.134
why I said all of that.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.802
Mmm.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.515
Oh.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.232
Do you need help, sir?

24:45.025 --> 24:47.235
What's going on?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.821
Oh.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.158
-You're burning up.
-No, no, it's fine. I'm fine.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.619
I nearly pissed myself that night.

24:55.702 --> 24:59.039
I thought the thing was dead,
but then it shot up like a zombie.

24:59.122 --> 25:01.791
It started glaring at me
with one of its eyes popping out.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.753
I saw it in my dream last night.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.630
Everyone who got eliminated

25:06.713 --> 25:09.257
in Red Light, Green Light
was shot by a sniper rifle.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.009
We could hardly salvage anything.

25:11.843 --> 25:15.222
That zombie looked promising.
At least before we saw inside.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.433
I almost died
making the delivery that day.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.686
But we didn't even get full price
because it only had one kidney.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.105
It's my fault the zombie
was missing a kidney?

25:24.689 --> 25:26.525
Hopefully,
this guy is all right.

25:27.400 --> 25:31.238
Most people who came here either signed
away their bodies or are terminally ill.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.114
This one better be worth it.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.496
Here. Lie down.

25:40.288 --> 25:41.498
Wait right here.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.793
Okay. We need to lower your fever.
Hold on.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.340
Ah, shit.

25:50.423 --> 25:51.758
Here. Use this.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.726
So what happened…

26:04.312 --> 26:05.397
to that zombie?

26:06.606 --> 26:08.483
What do you think happened to it?

26:08.984 --> 26:12.487
We were in a hurry,
so I beat it to death with that.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.702
Hold on.
Why do you need to ask?

26:18.785 --> 26:20.203
You were there for the whole thing.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.454
What the hell?

26:22.205 --> 26:23.164
Don't you remember?

26:27.168 --> 26:28.169
Back then…

26:29.963 --> 26:31.423
I was a bit out of it.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.008
You were out of it?

26:34.384 --> 26:37.262
You got rid of the body
with your own hands.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.140
Number 29.

26:40.932 --> 26:44.185
-You haven't been--
-This is my operating room, okay?

26:45.729 --> 26:48.898
Stop chatting and do what I say,
so I can actually do some work!

26:50.317 --> 26:52.694
Just let me work in peace, okay?

26:52.777 --> 26:53.903
If you don't shut up,

26:53.987 --> 26:56.656
I'll cut right through his liver
and kidneys just like this! Damn it!

27:10.045 --> 27:11.296
Thank you, friend.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.594
Just you rest now.

27:19.512 --> 27:20.639
After all, we can't…

27:21.431 --> 27:23.350
start the next game without you.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.111
You should go and rest.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.781
I can handle this alone.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.325
We agreed to do pairs.

27:41.284 --> 27:43.036
And I'm already awake now.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.208
Thanks so much.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.297
For this.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.592
It wasn't for free.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.595
You can pay me back tomorrow.

28:18.279 --> 28:19.280
Hurry up.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.533
They're all in great condition this time.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.076
Make sure you get full price.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.130
Pick up the pace.
The boat's already here.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.356
All right, I'm done.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.816
What game is up next?

28:54.899 --> 28:56.359
We don't know yet.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.319
What'd you say?

28:59.279 --> 29:00.196
Bullshit.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.240
We haven't been told what it is yet.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.908
You better go and ask your boss.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.453
There must be somebody up there
you can go ask.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.621
If he knew,
he would've told us already.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.541
-I'm sure there's a reason.
-It sounds like that's on you.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.544
I did everything you said to.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.838
Go tell them to find out this second!

29:16.921 --> 29:18.423
Go back and wait!

29:18.506 --> 29:20.300
I'll tell you before the next game begins.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.303
This is a bunch of bullshit!

29:42.489 --> 29:43.823
What are you doing?

29:43.907 --> 29:44.783
Pull.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.286
-Calm down.
-Tell me what the game is,

30:30.370 --> 30:32.455
or else I'm gonna end up
getting killed tonight!

30:32.539 --> 30:35.792
This isn't the way to handle things.
Give us more time.

30:35.875 --> 30:38.044
I'm not giving you
any more time, assholes!

30:38.127 --> 30:41.047
-Then what do you suggest?
-Check what's next and come back.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.675
And you…

30:43.758 --> 30:46.135
you'll be staying right here
until he returns, okay?

30:46.219 --> 30:48.555
It'll be more dangerous if we stay here.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.515
We have to get back
before morning roll call!

30:50.598 --> 30:52.767
I don't care about any of that shit!

30:53.935 --> 30:56.729
No, I'm not going anywhere
until I know what it is.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.524
Fine, okay. Calm down.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.986
Go up and find out what the game is.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.488
Okay.

31:11.077 --> 31:12.036
Wait!

31:12.579 --> 31:14.163
You have to take the key.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.500
The key to upstairs
is in my right side pocket.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.295
Don't try to pull something.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.588
I'm not.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.090
He needs it to get into the control room.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.885
If you don't trust me,
you can throw it to him yourself.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.176
Don't touch it.

32:08.259 --> 32:13.890
It's a bomb. They made this passage
so the VIPs could escape in an emergency.

32:13.973 --> 32:15.516
And once they're all out,

32:15.600 --> 32:17.977
they set that off
and blow the entire place.

32:18.561 --> 32:21.064
The VIPs? Who are they?

32:22.023 --> 32:23.566
That's as much as I know.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.214
Number 29.

32:57.266 --> 32:59.143
Are you there?
The doctor escaped.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.026
Damn it.

33:08.277 --> 33:09.320
Shit.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.709
Shit!

33:42.186 --> 33:45.023
Why do you wanna know
who the VIPs are?

33:46.983 --> 33:48.234
I was just grateful

33:49.777 --> 33:51.863
for our diving equipment and this passage.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.407
They prepared it all for us.

33:54.490 --> 33:56.784
Not only are you more curious,

33:56.868 --> 33:58.703
but your voice seems to have changed.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.288
Let me see your face.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.083
Do you have to do this?

34:07.462 --> 34:08.755
Do you wanna die?

34:21.350 --> 34:22.894
Who are you?

34:32.445 --> 34:34.572
Now show me yours.

34:36.657 --> 34:37.867
Do you wanna die?

34:58.054 --> 34:59.430
Stay away!

35:01.057 --> 35:03.351
Calm down.
We can still fix this.

35:03.434 --> 35:04.685
How will you do that?

35:06.229 --> 35:07.230
Using that gun?

35:07.313 --> 35:08.648
Think about it.

35:08.731 --> 35:10.399
Why would I kill you anyway?

35:10.483 --> 35:12.318
That'll only complicate things.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.112
It's complicated already.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.280
I had to kill your friend.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.824
He wasn't a friend.

35:17.907 --> 35:22.203
Look, listen.
I can throw bodies in the incinerator.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.580
The guy you killed, I'll just cremate him.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.750
It's a huge problem
when a player goes missing,

35:27.834 --> 35:30.628
but when it's soldier,
no one cares about that.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.298
Who I am

35:35.341 --> 35:37.510
doesn't matter right now, you got that?

35:42.682 --> 35:46.352
Now, what matters is the identity
of the man that you murdered here.

35:48.062 --> 35:49.689
The one you've been calling a zombie.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.568
With the one kidney, the one you put
on the table who woke up.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.737
You know where that other kidney went?

35:57.738 --> 35:58.781
In here.

35:59.824 --> 36:00.908
It's in here.

36:02.910 --> 36:05.413
He was my brother.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.915
-He gave me that kidney.
-No, no, wait!

36:10.626 --> 36:12.003
It was a girl.

36:12.086 --> 36:13.296
Not a man.

36:13.379 --> 36:14.672
I'm not lying.

36:14.755 --> 36:16.716
I'll find out what the next game is.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.510
If you make a bigger scene and get caught,

36:20.094 --> 36:21.679
we'll both die for nothing.

36:22.972 --> 36:23.806
Trust me.

36:24.557 --> 36:25.766
We still have a chance.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.227
How can I trust someone like you, scumbag?

36:45.745 --> 36:46.746
Look.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.582
Now you see, we're all the same here.

37:03.095 --> 37:03.930
All right.

37:04.555 --> 37:06.682
You just need to go back quietly.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.727
If you go back before your bedtime is up…

37:10.978 --> 37:12.772
you and I can live through this.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.614
Then what do I have to do?

37:25.910 --> 37:27.411
Listen, doctor.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.419
Let's get you washed up
before anything else.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.301
I'm not lying!

37:43.719 --> 37:44.804
It was a girl.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.555
It sounds like bullshit.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.225
Before we operated on her,

37:50.059 --> 37:52.603
we took turns having sex
with the girl, okay?

37:53.187 --> 37:55.022
Would we have done that to a guy?

37:56.107 --> 37:58.234
Go check the list,
if you still don't trust me.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.028
-What list?
-There's a list of all the players

38:01.112 --> 38:02.738
with all their info as well.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.116
-Even their medical records.
-Where?

38:09.078 --> 38:10.454
Over the ladderway in…

38:11.622 --> 38:12.748
the room the leader is in.

38:12.832 --> 38:13.833
Leader?

38:13.916 --> 38:15.251
You've seen him.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.420
His mask isn't the same.

38:26.220 --> 38:30.433
And so, you and I
will find your brother, okay?

38:31.142 --> 38:34.395
And I'll give you all the money I got
selling organs!

38:36.647 --> 38:38.482
Once we're a team, we'll be, uh--

38:54.206 --> 38:56.751
Whether you sell
the dead bodies' organs

38:56.834 --> 39:00.254
or eat them or whatever,
I don't give a damn.

39:00.838 --> 39:04.592
However, you ruined the most important
aspect of this place.

39:09.472 --> 39:10.848
Equality.

39:11.724 --> 39:14.185
Everyone is equal
while they play this game.

39:14.852 --> 39:18.397
Here, every player gets to play
a fair game under the same conditions.

39:19.398 --> 39:22.735
These people suffered from inequality
and discrimination out in the world,

39:23.361 --> 39:26.947
and we're giving them one last chance
to fight fair and win.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.826
But you broke that principle.

39:33.162 --> 39:35.331
Sir, I'm sorry.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.717
Sir. We found the rest.

41:34.950 --> 41:36.202
That was 28.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.453
There's one more.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.622
The one who killed this one.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.374
He could've escaped to the sea already.

41:45.294 --> 41:47.379
No oxygen tanks are missing.

41:47.463 --> 41:49.048
He's still here somewhere.

41:49.590 --> 41:50.424
Find him.

Number 29 is gone too.

44:44.431 --> 44:45.766
Find him.

44:46.809 --> 44:48.811
He's not on the security cameras.

44:53.273 --> 44:54.900
He has to be in here.

45:01.281 --> 45:02.991
Attention. All players,

45:03.075 --> 45:05.077
please make your way
to the center of the room.

45:05.786 --> 45:07.121
Once again…

45:07.204 --> 45:08.914
-Attention. All players…
-All of you, go.

45:08.997 --> 45:11.458
please make your way
to the center of the room.

45:14.002 --> 45:15.254
Hey, move it.

45:16.672 --> 45:19.550
What's going on in here? Shit.

45:21.510 --> 45:23.429
Hey, boss, about the doctor,
he's not here.

45:26.932 --> 45:28.058
Get up.

45:29.810 --> 45:30.769
Get up.

45:33.188 --> 45:34.022
Now!

45:34.106 --> 45:36.442
Listen. He's very sick right now, sir.
