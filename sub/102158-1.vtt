M_I_SForEver

05:02.870 --> 05:03.771
Good morning.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.753
- You're it!
- No, you're it!

05:18.786 --> 05:20.788
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, girls.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.758
Where's Gabrielle?

05:23.791 --> 05:24.792
Home.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.761
I will bring her next time.

05:26.794 --> 05:27.862
- Please do.
- We need her.

05:27.895 --> 05:28.796
To play with us.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.788
Here's your money.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.859
How's work?

07:38.893 --> 07:39.827
As usual.

07:42.997 --> 07:45.032
You still won't tell me what
you're working on.

07:48.869 --> 07:49.937
No.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.840
And I probably never will.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.442
If I tell you, you too will
think I'm crazy.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.213
You know that's not true.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.448
You know you can trust me.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.451
But I do think you're crazy

08:04.485 --> 08:06.120
when you fall asleep in
less then a minute.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.788
Guilty.

08:09.857 --> 08:13.827
I'm sorry, I'm just a bit
curious that's all.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.462
I know.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.464
That's why you were my
favorite student

08:18.432 --> 08:20.234
'cause of your curiosity.

08:20.267 --> 08:23.804
Was that the
only reason?

08:25.172 --> 08:25.973
Well.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.852
Are you going to sleep now?

08:42.155 --> 08:42.957
Probably.

08:44.091 --> 08:44.858
Uh-uh.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.990
Daddy!

09:17.992 --> 09:19.827
Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?

09:19.860 --> 09:20.961
I saw him, I saw him!

09:20.995 --> 09:21.996
Calm down, honey.

09:22.029 --> 09:22.830
Who?

09:22.863 --> 09:23.831
What happened?

09:23.864 --> 09:25.432
I saw him, it was the monster!

09:25.466 --> 09:28.168
Calm down, Gaby, calm down.

09:28.202 --> 09:31.472
Remember what I told you,
he is not here.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.807
He can't be everywhere, right?

09:33.841 --> 09:34.975
But he came to me and-

09:35.009 --> 09:36.577
In your dreams.

09:36.610 --> 09:37.444
But what did we say?

09:37.478 --> 09:39.280
Who is in charge of
your dreamworld?

09:39.313 --> 09:40.981
Who's the queen?

09:41.015 --> 09:41.649
Me.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.485
This is our world, not his.

09:44.518 --> 09:45.919
- Our world, okay.
- Yes.

09:45.953 --> 09:46.820
Okay?

09:46.854 --> 09:48.188
Now go back to bed.

09:48.222 --> 09:49.957
If you see him tell him I'm
going to kick his ass

09:49.990 --> 09:51.825
if he tries to scare you again,
okay.

09:51.859 --> 09:52.860
Okay.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.061
All right, now go.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.474
They called today.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.876
Who called?

10:44.345 --> 10:45.212
The faculty.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.848
They wanted to know
how you were.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.218
And what did you tell them?

10:54.054 --> 10:55.022
That you're fine.

11:01.295 --> 11:05.933
Do you think that we see the
entirety of everything

11:05.966 --> 11:07.634
that's around us in a world?

11:11.238 --> 11:12.973
What do you mean?

11:13.941 --> 11:18.645
Well, we rely on our senses,

11:18.679 --> 11:22.649
sight, hearing, taste, smell,
touch

11:24.084 --> 11:26.086
to experience the world,

11:27.654 --> 11:29.189
but can we say with certainty

11:29.223 --> 11:30.657
that there isn't more
to the world

11:30.691 --> 11:34.863
than what we perceive
with our senses?

11:38.733 --> 11:39.666
Just think about it,

11:41.502 --> 11:45.639
what would it be like to
actually see music?

11:47.207 --> 11:51.011
Now what if we haven't yet
developed senses

11:51.044 --> 11:53.080
to perceive other
things around us?

11:55.516 --> 11:58.085
What if we have lost them
a long time ago

11:59.721 --> 12:03.023
to sense things, other things

12:04.425 --> 12:06.960
beyond the scope of
our imagination?

12:14.668 --> 12:16.336
You are ahead of our time.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.005
I know that.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.679
It's a cold morning, eh?

13:02.216 --> 13:03.650
You're not cold?

13:48.362 --> 13:50.063
Sorry to wake you up.

14:08.783 --> 14:10.517
Leave my rope alone.

14:12.887 --> 14:14.655
Uh, leave it alone.

14:17.792 --> 14:22.429
I've told you hundreds of
times, it's mine, and mine only.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.833
If you need it that bad
buy yourself one.

14:25.867 --> 14:27.301
You're stupid.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.870
You've always been stupid.

14:28.903 --> 14:31.672
I don't even know what I'm
gonna do with you all day.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.723
Well, well, good
morning to you.

15:25.893 --> 15:27.327
Where's Gaby?

15:27.361 --> 15:28.863
Did she come?

15:28.896 --> 15:31.766
Uh, no, not today, soon.

15:31.799 --> 15:33.735
Don't worry, tomorrow.

15:33.768 --> 15:34.802
I promise.

15:37.872 --> 15:38.740
See you, sir.

15:49.383 --> 15:49.951
Hello, my friend.

15:49.984 --> 15:51.853
Morning, Professor.

15:51.886 --> 15:53.721
How are you feeling today?

15:53.755 --> 15:54.789
Very well.

15:54.822 --> 15:55.790
How are you?

15:56.690 --> 15:57.925
Good, as always.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.963
I received a call from the
faculty yesterday.

16:01.996 --> 16:04.665
Yes, I told them to call you.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.869
What can I do for you,
Professor?

16:07.902 --> 16:10.705
Well, you didn't answer my
calls yesterday,

16:10.738 --> 16:12.572
so I wanted to
check out on you.

16:12.606 --> 16:13.741
I'm sorry about that.

16:13.775 --> 16:16.443
I, I was just too tired.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.847
I was working all day
on my research.

16:19.881 --> 16:21.281
And how is that going?

16:22.917 --> 16:25.720
Good for now.

16:25.753 --> 16:27.421
We will see.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.923
You came there to rest.

16:29.757 --> 16:31.558
You need to do so.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.561
I came here to finish my work,
Professor.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.330
And when you finished,
will you come back?

16:37.364 --> 16:38.866
I won't be coming back, sir.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.736
All I need is to
figure this out.

16:41.769 --> 16:43.270
I'm this close.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.706
I, I can feel it.

16:44.739 --> 16:45.907
It won't bring her back.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.912
Excuse me?

16:50.945 --> 16:52.512
Your wife.

16:52.546 --> 16:54.514
She is dead, Professor.

16:54.548 --> 16:56.751
Your research will not
bring her back.

16:57.952 --> 17:00.587
Stop doing this and
come back to us.

17:01.555 --> 17:02.757
Your students need you.

17:02.790 --> 17:06.728
With all do respect, sir,
it was you that kicked me out.

17:06.761 --> 17:08.694
I mean not you, but
the faculty did.

17:08.730 --> 17:10.696
They did not kick you out.

17:10.732 --> 17:12.531
They suspended you, Professor.

17:12.566 --> 17:13.734
It's the same thing to me.

17:13.768 --> 17:14.702
I don't care.

17:14.736 --> 17:15.770
...kick you out.

17:23.477 --> 17:24.277
Ready?

17:26.378 --> 17:30.051
Did you know that the
folding chess board

17:30.084 --> 17:32.954
was invented by a
priest in 1125.

17:34.621 --> 17:37.725
Since the church forbid
priests to play chess

17:38.960 --> 17:40.527
he hide the board by
making it look

17:40.560 --> 17:42.897
like two books lying next
to each other.

17:51.906 --> 17:53.708
So it's a Devil's game.

17:54.909 --> 17:56.610
If you believe in
him then yeah.

18:00.614 --> 18:03.985
And what if all this
around us is a game

18:04.018 --> 18:05.385
just like this one?

18:06.754 --> 18:09.791
We're merely actors played on
the stage of life

18:10.758 --> 18:12.727
and this world is an illusion.

18:13.961 --> 18:15.395
No one really dies.

18:16.130 --> 18:17.631
No one is really hurt.

18:20.101 --> 18:21.401
You're getting better.

18:23.771 --> 18:25.672
I'm not as good as you are,
Professor,

18:25.706 --> 18:29.010
but still I have my moves.

18:30.912 --> 18:32.379
You're just so unpredictable.

18:34.749 --> 18:36.951
Sometimes I think
you're cheating.

18:38.953 --> 18:41.354
I'm not that good at chess.

18:41.388 --> 18:45.726
No, you're not, but you might
be good at cheating.

18:46.928 --> 18:49.764
I played chess every day
with my students,

18:49.964 --> 18:51.732
picked up a lot of
moves from them.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.568
Maybe you learned how
to cheat too.

18:54.769 --> 18:55.903
If you think I'm a cheat

18:55.937 --> 18:58.538
then why do you play
chess with me?

18:58.572 --> 18:59.907
I'm trying to figure it out.

19:03.144 --> 19:05.512
Ah, hello, my friend.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.881
Did someone see my ax?

19:06.914 --> 19:08.716
I can't work without my ax.

19:09.951 --> 19:11.384
I haven't seen it.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.053
Did you finish?

19:12.086 --> 19:12.887
Yeah.

19:13.955 --> 19:15.890
But now I can't find my fuckin'
ax.

19:16.958 --> 19:18.860
I'll kill those thieves
if I find them.

19:20.761 --> 19:22.830
This is actually really nice.

19:22.864 --> 19:24.598
You could be a carpenter.

19:25.099 --> 19:28.803
Carpenter, carpenter,
me?

19:29.937 --> 19:31.504
I didn't mean to offend you.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.842
Those fuckin' kids took it.

19:34.876 --> 19:36.944
I guarantee you,
I'll fuckin' kill them when I see them.

19:37.778 --> 19:39.780
You should be more
careful with that ax.

19:40.815 --> 19:41.983
Someone could get hurt.

19:45.786 --> 19:48.622
So young, so frustrated.

19:49.757 --> 19:50.557
Let him be.

19:51.926 --> 19:52.727
Play.

20:03.804 --> 20:04.805
What?

20:04.839 --> 20:05.706
Checkmate.

20:07.641 --> 20:08.910
Really?

20:08.943 --> 20:10.410
Maybe next time, my friend.

20:11.645 --> 20:12.947
You always say that.

20:12.980 --> 20:13.948
Only when I win.

20:14.982 --> 20:16.784
Well, it's time for me to go.

20:17.952 --> 20:19.754
It was a pleasure
playing with you.

20:20.821 --> 20:22.189
Yeah, yeah.

20:22.223 --> 20:23.958
Well, see you tomorrow.

20:23.991 --> 20:25.760
Maybe then I'll beat you.

20:25.793 --> 20:26.894
Yeah, maybe.

20:59.126 --> 21:01.461
The plants died again.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.034
Maybe we're doing
something wrong.

21:07.068 --> 21:08.803
Abby, but you've seen it.

21:08.836 --> 21:12.139
Every plant Dad brings home
after a while just dies.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.608
This time it won't happen,
okay.

21:15.642 --> 21:19.780
We'll prove that it has nothing
to do with him, never had.

21:19.814 --> 21:21.749
Hey, we'll get you another one.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.918
We'll save it this time, okay?

21:23.951 --> 21:24.919
You promise?

21:24.952 --> 21:25.820
I promise.

21:28.990 --> 21:30.257
Fucking hammer!

21:32.326 --> 21:34.261
Fucking Christ, this is a
piece of shit!

21:35.062 --> 21:36.596
Can't work like this!

21:37.765 --> 21:38.531
Fuck you!

21:45.638 --> 21:46.774
Fucking hammer!

21:47.842 --> 21:48.641
Fuck!

22:57.011 --> 22:58.979
Abby, I'm not really in
the mood for that.

23:00.014 --> 23:03.884
Let me guess, you are tired.

23:03.918 --> 23:06.787
Look, Abby, I'm, I'm,
I'm sorry.

24:23.964 --> 24:24.765
I'm sorry.

24:27.301 --> 24:29.837
I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

24:37.811 --> 24:38.812
I know.

25:42.009 --> 25:43.777
You know our plant died.

25:45.846 --> 25:47.848
I don't know what's wrong
with those plants.

25:50.050 --> 25:50.918
Me neither.

25:50.951 --> 25:52.052
Doesn't make any sense.

25:55.889 --> 25:58.859
At least she hasn't had one of
those nightmares last night.

26:05.032 --> 26:06.166
She lost her mother,

26:08.435 --> 26:10.304
don't let her lose her
father as well.

26:12.840 --> 26:13.841
I know.

26:14.875 --> 26:16.810
I'll take her with me tomorrow.

26:16.844 --> 26:17.845
Please do.

27:48.703 --> 27:50.637
Why is the toilet locked?

28:30.677 --> 28:31.678
You okay, Gaby?

28:31.713 --> 28:32.913
Yeah.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.651
What do you think about her?

28:38.152 --> 28:39.953
She's fine.

28:39.987 --> 28:42.556
She was so happy today, I
don't know why.

28:47.027 --> 28:48.495
You know she's doing her best,
right?

28:49.463 --> 28:50.631
Yeah, I know.

28:50.664 --> 28:52.933
But she can't replace Mom.

28:54.034 --> 28:57.137
No, but give her chance.

29:04.678 --> 29:05.679
Go play.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.614
I'll pick you up when I'm done.

29:07.648 --> 29:08.415
Okay.

30:58.258 --> 30:59.827
We haven't seen you
for so long.

30:59.861 --> 31:01.662
- I suppose.
- Maybe she has a new friend.

31:01.863 --> 31:02.696
I don't.

31:02.897 --> 31:04.097
Mony's jealous.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.668
Here, I'll count for you.

31:07.701 --> 31:09.236
One, two.

31:09.503 --> 31:10.805
One, two.

31:10.838 --> 31:14.074
Faster, faster, faster, faster!

31:26.253 --> 31:27.120
I'm okay.

31:32.693 --> 31:33.861
Do you like it?

31:33.895 --> 31:35.763
Yeah, it's beautiful.

31:35.797 --> 31:36.764
Does it die?

31:36.798 --> 31:37.732
Everybody dies.

31:38.699 --> 31:40.500
But this one doesn't.

31:40.902 --> 31:42.369
Really, can I take it?

31:42.569 --> 31:43.437
No, it's mine.

31:44.438 --> 31:47.274
But there are a lot of
them in the woods.

32:01.889 --> 32:03.590
You're eating too much
sugar my friend.

32:04.558 --> 32:05.359
Indeed.

32:06.828 --> 32:07.895
It accelerates my brain.

32:09.731 --> 32:11.598
That's your plan to beat me.

32:12.532 --> 32:13.101
No.

32:13.968 --> 32:15.502
I just like eating sugar.

32:16.570 --> 32:17.705
Makes me think fast.

32:18.672 --> 32:20.742
Okay, whatever makes you happy.

32:21.709 --> 32:22.710
Mm-hmm.

32:28.983 --> 32:30.885
You know the pond
is artificial.

32:35.923 --> 32:38.558
It was made by people so they
could go fishing.

32:39.359 --> 32:39.927
Yeah, I know.

32:43.731 --> 32:46.600
And there's some theory
about a crazy fish.

32:48.936 --> 32:50.671
I don't like those
kind of theories.

32:52.940 --> 32:55.810
Well, there may be some
truth in the story.

33:00.280 --> 33:02.750
What about those crazy fish?

33:05.585 --> 33:09.724
He swims vertically or upside
down when he's hunting.

33:10.758 --> 33:11.893
In our pond?

33:12.693 --> 33:13.460
Where else?

33:14.762 --> 33:16.697
You should ask the old Boatman.

33:17.732 --> 33:19.867
What about him?

33:19.901 --> 33:20.735
Well, he loves fishing.

33:24.806 --> 33:26.708
Do you think something's
wrong with him?

33:28.608 --> 33:29.711
He doesn't speak.

33:30.945 --> 33:31.846
I noticed.

33:33.715 --> 33:35.850
And it has something to do
with the crazy fish.

33:38.518 --> 33:39.286
How?

33:40.922 --> 33:43.323
A couple of years ago I, I
read an article

33:43.356 --> 33:44.691
about a man and a cow.

33:46.761 --> 33:49.030
A man lived in a village
and he had a cow.

33:49.063 --> 33:50.564
It was everything to him.

33:51.766 --> 33:56.738
Every day he would feed her,
brush her, speak to her.

33:58.840 --> 33:59.874
And then the cow died.

34:01.475 --> 34:02.375
He grieved.

34:03.911 --> 34:04.712
He stopped speaking.

34:06.047 --> 34:08.783
And then every evening he would
go to the stable and sleep.

34:10.016 --> 34:14.420
He started eating straw and
drinking water from the bucket.

34:18.425 --> 34:19.559
The man became a cow.

34:21.896 --> 34:23.263
So he went mad.

34:24.899 --> 34:27.001
No, not that kind of madness.

34:28.870 --> 34:31.706
And what's this all got to do
with the Boatman?

34:33.908 --> 34:34.876
He caught the crazy fish.

34:39.781 --> 34:41.882
That kind of craziness.

34:41.916 --> 34:43.751
And then fish got
back in the pond.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.721
He never saw it again.

34:46.754 --> 34:48.723
This really
makes sense.

34:50.925 --> 34:52.292
You shouldn't laugh.

35:00.768 --> 35:01.836
That was quick.

35:02.770 --> 35:04.404
I must go find Gabrielle.

35:09.744 --> 35:10.711
You let me win.

35:13.781 --> 35:14.782
Shame on you.

36:08.769 --> 36:09.770
Luci?

36:10.805 --> 36:11.806
Mony?

36:39.499 --> 36:40.600
Daddy, Daddy!

36:41.235 --> 36:42.136
Gabrielle, where were you?

36:42.169 --> 36:44.571
I was looking for you all
over the place.

36:44.604 --> 36:45.773
I saw him, I saw him!

36:45.973 --> 36:47.808
- Who?
- The monster here in the woods.

36:48.042 --> 36:50.745
Gabrielle, there is no
monsters here or anywhere.

36:50.945 --> 36:52.146
This has to stop.

36:52.780 --> 36:53.915
But I saw him.

36:53.948 --> 36:56.017
What were you doing
there anyway?

36:56.050 --> 36:57.785
Don't go in the woods alone.

36:57.818 --> 36:59.020
Why don't you believe me?

36:59.053 --> 37:00.453
Mom would believe me.

37:10.932 --> 37:12.033
What happened?

37:12.800 --> 37:14.735
She got lost in the woods.

37:14.769 --> 37:15.870
Oh my God.

37:15.903 --> 37:17.537
Is she okay?

37:17.570 --> 37:18.205
She's fine.

37:43.798 --> 37:45.833
How was your day with
Luci and Mony?

37:53.908 --> 37:55.876
She's talking to you, Gaby.

37:57.778 --> 37:58.846
Fine.

38:00.948 --> 38:02.615
Eat your food.

38:03.951 --> 38:04.919
I'm not hungry.

38:04.952 --> 38:05.820
I wanna go to bed.

38:12.827 --> 38:13.828
Okay, let's go.

39:11.618 --> 39:14.021
I just wanted to find
a new plant.

39:14.055 --> 39:15.923
One that won't die.

39:15.956 --> 39:16.757
I know.

39:18.826 --> 39:19.760
But daddy scared me.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.162
He didn't believe me.

39:22.897 --> 39:24.231
He's just worried, my love.

39:25.833 --> 39:27.234
He's working too much,

39:27.268 --> 39:29.170
and he's under a lot
of pressure.

39:30.137 --> 39:32.840
So forgive him if he loses his
temper sometimes.

39:35.076 --> 39:36.777
He loves you very much.

39:37.945 --> 39:39.847
And I love you very much.

39:41.816 --> 39:42.817
I love him too.

39:44.351 --> 39:45.352
And you too.

42:13.000 --> 42:13.801
Hi.

42:14.902 --> 42:15.936
Hi, Mony.

42:15.970 --> 42:18.005
Can I wait with you?

42:18.038 --> 42:18.839
Sure.

42:21.308 --> 42:22.977
You seem a bit
different lately.

42:25.879 --> 42:28.382
Sorry, I think that's because
I'm a little distracted.

42:30.284 --> 42:32.019
Have you been working too much?

42:34.054 --> 42:35.823
I guess so.

42:35.856 --> 42:37.191
What are you working on?

42:39.026 --> 42:40.261
Well, I'm the pond keeper.

42:41.996 --> 42:42.896
What do you keep?

42:45.866 --> 42:47.268
Everything I guess.

42:49.103 --> 42:50.871
I know how you feel.

42:54.608 --> 42:55.876
Where's your sister?

42:57.478 --> 42:58.279
I don't know.

42:59.513 --> 43:01.949
I ran off, I get angry.

43:02.850 --> 43:05.486
She thinks I'm selfish,
and it's true.

43:05.519 --> 43:07.187
But it's because of her.

43:07.221 --> 43:11.292
I inherit all of her old or
small clothes and ugly dolls.

43:14.461 --> 43:15.929
You can buy new things.

43:17.464 --> 43:19.266
It's too expensive.

43:19.300 --> 43:20.901
We don't need to
spend more money.

43:23.370 --> 43:24.438
Yeah, you're right.

43:26.640 --> 43:28.442
But I'll tell you a secret.

43:31.011 --> 43:33.280
I have stolen her
favorite doll.

43:38.519 --> 43:39.953
A lot of things happened,

43:41.522 --> 43:44.291
but it's all clear to me now.

43:44.325 --> 43:46.593
There are symbols everywhere,

43:46.994 --> 43:50.898
here, in the woods, in the
pond, even in my home.

43:53.667 --> 43:57.338
This is why I think we are not
here by accident.

43:59.406 --> 44:01.909
The system works
without our will.

44:04.011 --> 44:06.613
The world is made of circles

44:06.647 --> 44:10.017
and we are in the middle
of those circles.

44:10.050 --> 44:12.886
And they are turning around,
and around,

44:12.920 --> 44:14.888
and, and just stop.

44:17.658 --> 44:20.861
When she died I, I
wanted to know why.

44:21.995 --> 44:24.498
Why did she have to go?

44:24.531 --> 44:26.633
I was looking for answers,
why her?

44:27.034 --> 44:29.303
Why do we all have to go
through this immense pain?

44:32.005 --> 44:33.173
Sorry, Professor.

44:33.207 --> 44:34.508
Give me one moment.

45:20.755 --> 45:23.490
Listen, I'm quite concerned
about something.

45:24.691 --> 45:27.394
Has he ever told you anything
about the circles?

45:29.229 --> 45:30.030
No.

45:31.398 --> 45:32.966
Then go and check it out.

46:57.084 --> 46:58.318
Where are you going?

46:58.352 --> 46:59.319
Stay here.

46:59.353 --> 47:00.687
But where are you going?

47:00.722 --> 47:02.689
I have to go up to
the university.

47:04.091 --> 47:04.691
Lock the door.

47:21.508 --> 47:23.076
You're such a idiot!

47:23.110 --> 47:23.677
You're an idiot!

47:23.711 --> 47:24.712
Psycho!

47:24.746 --> 47:26.680
No, I'm not,
you're the psycho.

47:26.714 --> 47:27.715
I'm not the the psycho.

47:27.749 --> 47:29.082
Stop!

47:29.116 --> 47:29.717
Ah, ow!

47:32.887 --> 47:34.856
Idiot!

47:34.889 --> 47:36.690
You're so stupid.

47:36.724 --> 47:38.692
No you're stupid!

47:38.726 --> 47:40.127
You psycho!

47:40.160 --> 47:41.194
- You're such a idiot!
- Stop it!

47:41.228 --> 47:43.096
You're stupid, ow!

47:46.801 --> 47:47.668
Hey girls!

47:49.169 --> 47:50.337
I'm gonna get you!

48:02.850 --> 48:03.885
Hey!

48:03.918 --> 48:05.385
What the hell are you doing?

48:07.922 --> 48:09.456
Have you lost your minds?

48:11.425 --> 48:13.627
Hey, these kids, eh.

48:15.863 --> 48:17.431
What kids?

48:19.734 --> 48:20.667
Luci and Mony.

48:22.502 --> 48:24.104
Luci and Mony are at home,
Professor.

48:24.872 --> 48:26.273
What are you talking about?

48:27.809 --> 48:32.747
No, but they were
just right here.

48:35.783 --> 48:37.551
You must of seen them
run past here.

48:44.726 --> 48:46.728
I must, I must be tired.

48:49.764 --> 48:51.833
So much so you can't
play another game.

48:53.968 --> 48:55.702
It seems so.

48:55.737 --> 48:58.438
Hm, so you're rejecting me.

49:00.742 --> 49:02.342
No, that's not what I'm saying.

49:04.511 --> 49:05.880
Then it's time for a rematch.

49:16.390 --> 49:17.691
Play tricks on you.

49:19.827 --> 49:20.795
Come on.

49:21.729 --> 49:22.930
I think its one-one, isn't it?

50:45.479 --> 50:47.681
Timothy, 3:1-4.

50:49.549 --> 50:52.887
But understand this, that
in the last days

50:52.920 --> 50:54.889
there will come times
of difficulty.

50:55.857 --> 50:58.325
For people will be
lovers of self,

50:58.358 --> 51:03.363
lovers of money, proud,
arrogant, abusive,

51:03.563 --> 51:08.568
disobedient to their parents,
ungrateful, unholy,

51:08.770 --> 51:13.775
heartless, unappeasable,
slanderous, without self-control,

51:14.776 --> 51:19.546
brutal, not loving good,
treacherous, reckless,

51:19.747 --> 51:22.717
swollen with conceit,
lovers of pleasures

51:22.750 --> 51:25.418
rather than lovers of God.

51:26.754 --> 51:28.421
The darkness drops again,

51:29.489 --> 51:33.728
but now I know that 20
centuries of stony sleep

51:33.761 --> 51:36.696
were vexed to nightmare by
a rocking cradle,

51:37.799 --> 51:40.333
and what rough beast,

51:40.367 --> 51:42.904
its hour come round at last

51:42.937 --> 51:45.873
slouches towards
Bethlehem to be born.

51:58.085 --> 52:00.320
You're under the weather today,
Professor.

52:04.125 --> 52:04.926
I am.

52:08.763 --> 52:09.764
Why?

52:11.032 --> 52:12.499
Sorry, I can't play.

52:13.734 --> 52:14.501
Raincheck.

52:15.736 --> 52:18.538
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
accelerate your stress levels.

52:22.609 --> 52:23.711
What did you just say?

52:25.913 --> 52:28.850
I didn't mean to accelerate
your stress levels.

52:31.953 --> 52:32.920
Raincheck.

55:10.745 --> 55:11.912
The monster is here!

55:11.946 --> 55:12.747
Where?

55:21.956 --> 55:22.957
There's no one here.

55:22.990 --> 55:24.125
It was just here.

55:26.761 --> 55:27.694
Don't be scared.

55:27.728 --> 55:30.530
It was probably just a mouse
stuck somewhere.

55:31.664 --> 55:34.068
Daddy will open it and fix it
when he gets back, okay?

55:34.268 --> 55:35.836
Okay.

55:35.870 --> 55:36.636
Let's change.

56:28.022 --> 56:29.156
What the hell?

57:17.471 --> 57:21.674
The Boattman, he caught it with
his bare hands.

57:21.876 --> 57:25.880
He said, "Fish is
running out of time."

57:28.816 --> 57:29.416
He's right.

57:31.085 --> 57:32.786
At least about this one.

57:35.856 --> 57:36.924
How is Gabrielle?

57:38.826 --> 57:39.860
She's upset.

58:09.857 --> 58:11.926
Did you go out today?

58:16.897 --> 58:17.865
I was home all day.

58:44.825 --> 58:45.960
What are you doing?

58:48.162 --> 58:48.963
What?

01:00:48.982 --> 01:00:50.184
What's going on here?

01:00:52.052 --> 01:00:53.220
Good day, Professor.

01:00:54.221 --> 01:00:55.022
Please.

01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:57.958
Sit.

01:01:04.631 --> 01:01:05.599
Who gave you the key?

01:01:07.301 --> 01:01:09.002
Please, Professor.

01:01:09.036 --> 01:01:11.105
Please, sit down.

01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:14.641
I'll make us some tea.

01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:24.218
Who gave you the key?

01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:29.923
And why are you here?

01:01:29.957 --> 01:01:30.891
Easy, Professor.

01:01:32.192 --> 01:01:35.462
Sometimes in life
things just happen.

01:01:36.497 --> 01:01:38.632
Things don't just happen.

01:01:38.665 --> 01:01:42.636
And sometimes it's hard
to understand it.

01:01:43.537 --> 01:01:46.173
I'm a scientist, please
spare me the lecture.

01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:49.543
Ah, now you're a scientist.

01:01:49.744 --> 01:01:51.211
Just get to the point.

01:01:51.746 --> 01:01:53.013
Let's have some tea first.

01:01:53.046 --> 01:01:55.282
I don't have time for
this bullshit.

01:01:55.315 --> 01:01:56.617
I want to know what's going on.

01:01:58.085 --> 01:02:03.090
Well, obviously I
figured it out.

01:02:03.524 --> 01:02:05.058
What do you even mean?

01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:07.294
You weren't cheating.

01:02:09.663 --> 01:02:11.498
But it doesn't matter anymore.

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:16.503
You're upset 'cause I refused
to play last time.

01:02:18.205 --> 01:02:21.241
I was a little sad,
but not upset.

01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:23.711
I'm certainly not
that kind of man.

01:02:26.046 --> 01:02:29.183
Okay, what kind of man are you?

01:02:29.216 --> 01:02:30.417
You wanna play now?

01:02:32.653 --> 01:02:33.420
Not anymore.

01:02:38.692 --> 01:02:40.661
I was sitting by the pond,

01:02:42.831 --> 01:02:46.099
waiting for you and they came
and brought me a letter.

01:02:47.301 --> 01:02:48.035
Who?

01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:49.470
What, what letter?

01:02:51.806 --> 01:02:57.044
And I opened the letter and
inside there was nothing.

01:02:58.679 --> 01:03:03.684
Not a word, just a small blue
envelope...

01:03:05.152 --> 01:03:06.721
addressed to me.

01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:10.657
And we both know
what that means.

01:03:15.696 --> 01:03:17.765
It sounds like a
mystery but it's not.

01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:22.236
Obviously someone reported you.

01:03:25.372 --> 01:03:26.173
It was you.

01:03:28.509 --> 01:03:30.010
Frankly, I don't give a damn.

01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:34.681
I was playing chess
with you every day

01:03:34.716 --> 01:03:36.083
and you reported me.

01:03:37.251 --> 01:03:42.055
Well, maybe you shouldn't
be playing chess

01:03:42.089 --> 01:03:43.357
during working hours.

01:03:47.762 --> 01:03:48.629
You're a real predator.

01:03:48.662 --> 01:03:51.632
I've fought people like
you all my life.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.167
And now you must leave.

01:03:54.368 --> 01:03:55.035
Leave?

01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:57.705
I know what my job is, I don't
need you anymore.

01:03:57.739 --> 01:03:59.239
I will never leave this cabin.

01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:03.377
Then I will throw you out.

01:04:05.546 --> 01:04:06.781
I won't be the first.

01:06:32.994 --> 01:06:34.896
Professor.

01:06:34.929 --> 01:06:36.898
It's all clear now, Professor.

01:06:36.931 --> 01:06:37.732
Is what clear?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.735
Acceleration theories.

01:06:40.768 --> 01:06:42.737
I don't understand.

01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:46.841
Circles are narrowing, moving
toward the center.

01:06:48.009 --> 01:06:50.778
Look I really need you to
trust me on this, okay?

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.717
Please, you're my only hope,
Professor.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.484
You're the only
person I can trust.

01:06:57.517 --> 01:06:58.786
What about Abby?

01:06:59.721 --> 01:07:01.688
I don't know, maybe she's
gone crazy too.

01:07:02.824 --> 01:07:03.725
Listen,

01:07:05.592 --> 01:07:08.763
what if I told you that
we live in Hell already?

01:07:08.996 --> 01:07:10.031
Hell?

01:07:10.064 --> 01:07:12.033
What hell are you
talking about?

01:07:12.066 --> 01:07:16.738
Look, when my wife died I, I,
I was depressed.

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:19.741
I asked myself why did
she have to go?

01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:21.541
Does it have something to
do with my life,

01:07:21.575 --> 01:07:23.510
with Gabrielle's?

01:07:23.543 --> 01:07:24.277
Why her?

01:07:24.311 --> 01:07:25.880
Why not some killer?

01:07:25.913 --> 01:07:29.282
It's 'cause we are
already in Hell.

01:07:29.316 --> 01:07:30.550
I found proof.

01:07:30.584 --> 01:07:31.753
Oh, did you?

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.356
Dante was explaining
how Hell works.

01:07:36.389 --> 01:07:38.291
Not because he was
inspired about it

01:07:38.525 --> 01:07:41.695
or he was fantasizing about
something he, he,

01:07:41.896 --> 01:07:43.965
it was his description
of our mankind.

01:07:43.998 --> 01:07:46.700
He was talking about this,
Hell.

01:07:47.769 --> 01:07:48.770
He knew.

01:07:49.737 --> 01:07:50.905
Go on.

01:07:50.938 --> 01:07:55.810
Listen, listen to me carefully,
acceleration is constant.

01:07:55.843 --> 01:07:57.511
I found a frequency of it.

01:07:57.544 --> 01:07:59.546
I figured it out.

01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:00.580
Look at this scheme.

01:08:01.615 --> 01:08:02.750
I'm sending it right now.

01:08:07.955 --> 01:08:10.690
People are around me went
completely mad.

01:08:10.725 --> 01:08:12.760
The stupid Chess Player
took my place.

01:08:12.794 --> 01:08:15.595
You are far away, but
if you were here

01:08:15.629 --> 01:08:17.564
you would see it for yourself.

01:08:19.901 --> 01:08:22.737
Something happened,
someone reported me.

01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:24.872
They're going to be
here any minute.

01:08:24.906 --> 01:08:27.742
And I think, and I think
it's got something

01:08:27.774 --> 01:08:28.876
to do with my research.

01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:31.779
What the hell is
going on there?

01:08:31.813 --> 01:08:33.814
Nobody's taking my work!

01:08:33.848 --> 01:08:35.850
I'm the only one who
understand this place,

01:08:35.883 --> 01:08:38.786
and the stupid crazy fish,
and the crazy girls,

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:41.587
and the crazy Boattman!

01:08:41.788 --> 01:08:43.390
They're all crazy and they're
trying to make me crazy too

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:45.524
and steal my life!

01:08:45.559 --> 01:08:46.861
I'm not sure I understand.

01:08:48.395 --> 01:08:50.697
This is, this is...

01:08:52.033 --> 01:08:53.734
The truth.

01:08:53.768 --> 01:08:56.904
The place and the time.

01:08:56.938 --> 01:08:59.907
The circle is turning
towards the center.

01:09:01.809 --> 01:09:03.376
And the center is?

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:05.478
Here on this island.

01:09:07.014 --> 01:09:08.749
What you're trying to say is,

01:09:10.117 --> 01:09:12.752
that all your
research comes to you

01:09:13.854 --> 01:09:15.488
being the center of the world.

01:09:16.122 --> 01:09:19.160
My theory is that we are
in Hell already,

01:09:19.193 --> 01:09:20.928
and that we are
descending more and more.

01:09:20.962 --> 01:09:23.697
I know you will say that we
had more crimes,

01:09:23.731 --> 01:09:26.466
more violence, and more wars.

01:09:26.499 --> 01:09:27.902
That was confusing me too,

01:09:27.935 --> 01:09:30.872
but Hell is not about the fact

01:09:30.904 --> 01:09:32.874
that we are killing or
hating each other more.

01:09:32.907 --> 01:09:35.743
Hell is that we are
slowly giving away.

01:09:36.643 --> 01:09:39.613
We are not
controlling ourselves.

01:09:42.216 --> 01:09:44.551
That it is very important,

01:09:44.752 --> 01:09:47.755
because understanding that we
know this we can change.

01:09:47.787 --> 01:09:50.091
That is our only hope.

01:09:50.124 --> 01:09:53.828
You were my student and I gave
you my knowledge.

01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:56.831
How did you come up with this

01:09:56.864 --> 01:09:58.733
that the world
circles around you?

01:09:59.734 --> 01:10:01.635
I don't understand, I
don't understand.

01:10:01.836 --> 01:10:04.772
The, the events and the numbers
they all show clearly that.

01:10:04.805 --> 01:10:09.744
Oh, you will understand, you
will understand definitely.

01:10:11.779 --> 01:10:12.847
What do you mean?

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:17.852
You always thought you were
better than anyone else.

01:10:17.885 --> 01:10:20.922
This idea could have been mine.

01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:22.723
You're no better than me,
trust me.

01:10:28.796 --> 01:10:32.767
I want to tell you I heard a
song in a dream.

01:10:36.837 --> 01:10:41.842
When I heard the song I
realized that you were right.

01:10:43.778 --> 01:10:45.212
The end is near.

01:10:46.981 --> 01:10:47.915
What song?

01:10:47.949 --> 01:10:49.582
I, what?

01:10:49.616 --> 01:10:50.918
I don't understand.

01:10:52.585 --> 01:10:56.924
Do not wake him up,
he is dreaming.

01:10:56.958 --> 01:11:01.929
If he opens his eyes he will
not see us anymore.

01:11:03.764 --> 01:11:08.769
If he wakes we will
cease to exist.

01:11:10.237 --> 01:11:15.508
If we stop playing to him, he
will have nightmares.

01:11:17.244 --> 01:11:22.249
If it may be so then the world
is still in Hell.

01:11:24.318 --> 01:11:26.619
So be quiet, he's asleep.

01:11:29.123 --> 01:11:33.227
So sing in silence
while he dreams.

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:39.834
He dreams of the world,

01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:44.839
and the world dreams of him.

01:11:49.944 --> 01:11:51.812
The silence of the noise.

01:11:54.115 --> 01:11:56.583
The light of the darkness.

01:11:59.987 --> 01:12:01.856
Eternal to the end.

01:12:10.798 --> 01:12:13.600
Professor, what are you doing?

01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:17.004
No!

01:12:17.872 --> 01:12:18.671
No!

01:13:23.838 --> 01:13:26.006
Do not wake
him up, he is dreaming.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.810
If he opens his eyes he will
not see us anymore.

01:13:29.844 --> 01:13:32.746
If he wakes up, we will
cease to exist.

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.949
If we stop playing to him, he
will have nightmares.

01:13:34.982 --> 01:13:38.886
If so it may be so our world
will stay in Hell.

01:13:38.919 --> 01:13:41.322
So be quiet, he is asleep.

01:13:41.355 --> 01:13:43.824
Let's sing in silence
while he dreams.

01:13:43.858 --> 01:13:46.693
He dreams of a world while the
world dreams of him.

01:13:46.894 --> 01:13:49.296
In the silence of a noise, in
the darkness of a light,

01:13:49.463 --> 01:13:50.731
eternal in the end.

01:17:54.141 --> 01:17:56.176
You should go play with them.

01:17:56.210 --> 01:17:57.878
I have something to finish.

01:17:59.646 --> 01:18:00.614
Come, Gabrielle.

01:18:00.647 --> 01:18:01.882
Play with us.

01:18:04.017 --> 01:18:05.886
Abby, please don't
leave me here.

01:18:09.123 --> 01:18:11.892
Please, take the masks off.

01:18:13.227 --> 01:18:14.461
Come on, Gabrielle,

01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:16.063
play with us.

01:18:16.296 --> 01:18:17.898
Don't be so arrogant.

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:36.550
Gaby!

01:18:41.121 --> 01:18:41.688
Gaby!

01:18:46.026 --> 01:18:46.627
Gaby!

01:20:16.851 --> 01:20:18.218
Where's my daughter?

01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:20.153
I don't know.

01:20:22.089 --> 01:20:23.023
You're the father.

01:20:24.558 --> 01:20:26.660
You can stop playing games now,
just tell me where she is.

01:20:26.693 --> 01:20:29.764
Oh, come on, like you care.

01:20:31.431 --> 01:20:32.666
What's that supposed to mean?

01:20:34.234 --> 01:20:35.770
Oh, darling,

01:20:37.872 --> 01:20:39.072
I saw it.

01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:44.244
She became scared of you.

01:20:46.246 --> 01:20:48.649
I'm not sure she even
loves you anymore.

01:20:49.851 --> 01:20:51.051
That is a lie.

01:20:51.886 --> 01:20:54.521
You never even cared about her,

01:20:54.555 --> 01:20:57.324
just like you never cared
about your wife.

01:20:57.357 --> 01:20:58.659
Be quiet.

01:20:58.692 --> 01:20:59.727
You can't fool me.

01:21:01.896 --> 01:21:06.667
Remember when we met in your classroom.

01:21:12.573 --> 01:21:20.748
The way you looked at my eyes,
my hair, my legs.

01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:25.686
You forgot all about
your wife, did you?

01:21:28.355 --> 01:21:29.523
That is not true.

01:21:31.224 --> 01:21:34.695
I loved my wife,
and I love Gaby with all my heart.

01:21:36.764 --> 01:21:38.665
I would do everything to
have my family back.

01:21:40.835 --> 01:21:45.539
You know, when we met
the only thing

01:21:45.572 --> 01:21:48.810
I saw in your eyes was
desire, not love.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.754
Gaby!

01:22:03.925 --> 01:22:04.726
Gaby!

01:22:07.729 --> 01:22:08.730
Gaby!

01:23:17.264 --> 01:23:17.865
Gaby!

01:23:29.844 --> 01:23:30.812
Gaby!

01:23:35.449 --> 01:23:36.249
Gaby!

01:23:49.764 --> 01:23:50.564
Hey, girls.

01:23:51.398 --> 01:23:52.466
Have you seen Gaby?

01:23:54.401 --> 01:23:57.839
Come on, Gabrielle,
play with us.

01:24:42.784 --> 01:24:43.583
Gaby!

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.762
Dad, come on.

01:25:31.732 --> 01:25:33.935
Gaby, I want you to know how
much I love you.

01:25:33.968 --> 01:25:35.368
Dad, what are you doing?

01:25:35.402 --> 01:25:36.570
Come on.

01:25:36.603 --> 01:25:37.805
You must face your fears.

01:25:43.945 --> 01:25:46.881
They will disappear as if
they never existed.

01:25:46.914 --> 01:25:48.716
Dad, please.

01:25:51.719 --> 01:25:52.485
Dad.

01:26:09.971 --> 01:26:11.906
I'm sorry for everything.

01:26:32.927 --> 01:26:34.962
Do you what checkmate means?

01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:37.798
It means the king is dead.

01:26:38.766 --> 01:26:40.835
It's a Persian word.

01:26:40.868 --> 01:26:42.569
Shah met, they called it.

01:26:47.775 --> 01:26:48.876
Why are you here?

01:26:51.045 --> 01:26:53.480
Well, my friend,

01:26:53.513 --> 01:26:54.949
I could ask you the
same question.

01:26:58.819 --> 01:27:00.453
You all made me.

01:27:02.890 --> 01:27:04.025
And who are we again?

01:27:11.933 --> 01:27:12.733
Professor.

01:27:16.837 --> 01:27:17.905
What do you want from me?

01:27:19.807 --> 01:27:23.610
Did you know that the phrase
the king is dead

01:27:25.913 --> 01:27:30.617
came from France and it was
used by the son of a King

01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:33.620
known as the Beloved and Mad.

01:27:34.989 --> 01:27:37.058
He said, "The king is dead."

01:27:39.794 --> 01:27:41.429
Long live the king.

01:27:45.632 --> 01:27:47.201
Please, spare me.

01:27:48.568 --> 01:27:51.205
I'm not crazy even if you
want me to be.

01:27:52.139 --> 01:27:52.940
Perhaps.

01:27:54.942 --> 01:27:56.143
But we don't know that.

01:27:58.779 --> 01:28:00.114
What are you trying to say?

01:28:01.048 --> 01:28:05.552
What I'm trying to say is
that the king is dead

01:28:05.585 --> 01:28:07.722
is an announcement that a
king has just died.

01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:13.094
And long live the king, the
first of the heir,

01:28:13.127 --> 01:28:16.764
who immediately takes
over the throne

01:28:16.797 --> 01:28:18.665
upon the death of the
preceding ruler.

01:28:21.836 --> 01:28:23.971
Funny how they took that
from a game of chess.

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.742
What do you want from me?

01:28:32.847 --> 01:28:34.815
I just wanna play a game of
chess with you that's all.

01:28:37.584 --> 01:28:38.585
What about them?

01:28:40.955 --> 01:28:43.656
Well, they're all different.

01:28:44.959 --> 01:28:45.525
We're all different.

01:28:47.895 --> 01:28:49.629
You won't get my research.

01:28:57.604 --> 01:28:58.172
What's so funny?

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:04.278
Humans, you all think
the same thing.

01:29:05.946 --> 01:29:08.849
Oh, yeah, and what's that?

01:29:08.883 --> 01:29:09.950
That you're special.

01:29:12.953 --> 01:29:14.822
I mean you are, but not
in every story.

01:29:16.791 --> 01:29:18.325
You remind me of my brother.

01:29:19.927 --> 01:29:22.763
Oh, by the way it was him that
wanted your research not me.

01:29:23.798 --> 01:29:25.933
He couldn't stand that you
found out about us.

01:29:28.803 --> 01:29:30.603
And what about the rest of you?

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.641
Everyone gets what they wanted.

01:29:35.976 --> 01:29:36.811
He got what he wanted.

01:29:38.979 --> 01:29:41.614
He didn't get my research.

01:29:41.648 --> 01:29:42.817
It's in safe hands.

01:29:44.085 --> 01:29:47.788
My brother, no, no, he won't.

01:29:48.789 --> 01:29:49.490
You're right about that,

01:29:49.523 --> 01:29:52.726
but I wasn't talking about him.

01:29:54.829 --> 01:29:56.629
Who are you talking about then?

01:29:57.765 --> 01:29:59.767
About him.

01:30:08.843 --> 01:30:10.610
The masked man.

01:30:11.245 --> 01:30:12.746
If that's what you call him.

01:30:16.016 --> 01:30:17.985
And what does he want?

01:30:18.018 --> 01:30:21.122
This is not about you, friend.

01:30:21.155 --> 01:30:22.890
Where's Gaby?

01:30:22.923 --> 01:30:24.258
Every plant Dad brings home

01:30:24.291 --> 01:30:26.794
after a while just dies.

01:30:29.897 --> 01:30:31.899
This is about the successor.

01:30:32.967 --> 01:30:35.836
The one who will act as
prophet for them all.

01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:37.004
What are you talking about?

01:30:38.973 --> 01:30:42.810
You created Hell by
believing in it.

01:30:45.079 --> 01:30:47.281
And now is the perfect time
for him to come.

01:30:49.483 --> 01:30:50.784
But there can't be.

01:30:54.488 --> 01:30:55.289
Those who don't believe

01:30:55.322 --> 01:30:57.091
in the Devil already
belong to him.

01:31:01.428 --> 01:31:02.363
What do you mean?

01:31:03.197 --> 01:31:04.765
But Daddy scared me.

01:31:04.798 --> 01:31:05.900
He didn't believe me.

01:31:07.101 --> 01:31:08.903
I saw him, I saw him!

01:31:08.936 --> 01:31:10.404
The monster here in the woods!

01:31:10.437 --> 01:31:12.406
Gabrielle, there is
no monsters.

01:31:15.809 --> 01:31:18.779
He's already chosen his
successor, my friend,

01:31:20.948 --> 01:31:21.749
thanks to you.

01:31:25.819 --> 01:31:26.854
No.

01:31:48.042 --> 01:31:48.842
No.

01:32:09.296 --> 01:32:11.031
My friend, you lost this time.

01:32:18.973 --> 01:32:19.773
Checkmate.

01:32:27.481 --> 01:32:30.184
Or should I say the
king is dead.

01:32:43.831 --> 01:32:44.798
Long live the king.

01:34:21.808 --> 01:34:26.808
