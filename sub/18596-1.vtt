00:39.206 --> 00:41.250
Whoa.

04:28.686 --> 04:31.563
Whoa. Hey, where can
we get a bath?

04:31.689 --> 04:34.149
Barney Cashman's Russ House,
across the street.

04:34.233 --> 04:37.236
Thanks. Wes.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.489
Save a bath for me.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.465
Leave me alone. Keep away from me, Brockie.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.884
Don't make me shoot you.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.262
- What's wrong, John?
- Huh?

05:03.387 --> 05:05.681
Since when did you start
pulling a gun on a man's back?

05:05.764 --> 05:08.309
Griff? That you, Griff?

05:10.102 --> 05:12.146
You promised you'd wear glasses.

05:12.271 --> 05:16.275
Griff. Just goes to show if you pray
long enough, something happens.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.819
Praying never gave a man the shakes.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.613
- Who's picking on you, John?
- A boy, Griff.

05:21.739 --> 05:24.283
A wet-nose, but mean, ugly.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.077
- He was drunk...
- He made you skin back, didn't he?

05:27.202 --> 05:29.455
He gave me an hour to get out of town.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.374
- Then you'd better go.
- You gotta help me.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.460
I didn't come to town
to spank a wet-nose.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.671
If he throws down on me,
I haven't got a chance.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.591
Your eyes have been getting
worse, haven't they, John?

05:40.716 --> 05:43.761
I'm broke. I've got
to hang on to my job.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.263
There's nothing else I can do.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.016
You and me only got one trade.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.935
Take it away from us,
and what do you got left?

05:52.061 --> 05:54.021
There's a good eye doctor in Prescott.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.440
Oh, I can't sneak out like that, Griff.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.609
You haven't got any choice.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.320
You must have a good reason
for not wanting to help me.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.448
- It's none of my business.
- Then why are you here?

06:04.573 --> 06:07.910
Start running, John.
Run before your eyes give out all the way.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.079
What if the doctor can't make me see?

06:10.162 --> 06:12.539
Then you'll be blind instead of dead.

Put it back, Barney.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.687
- Griff.
- How are ya, Barney?

07:58.770 --> 08:00.481
That you behind
the shrubbery, Wes?

08:00.606 --> 08:02.399
Yep. How's nosy Barney?

08:02.524 --> 08:05.110
Bankin' my silver, boys.
This camp's a bonanza.

08:05.235 --> 08:09.698
- I told you, Griff. - Our brother,
Chico, he's headed for California.

08:09.781 --> 08:14.244
- California? With all the diggin's here?
- Our folks are out there.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.788
I couldn't help reading the name
on that warrant, Griff.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.333
You'll need more than a third gun
to pick up Howard Swain.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.085
- You know where I can find him?
- Out at the Dragoons.

08:22.211 --> 08:25.631
We passed nothing out there but a woman on
a white stallion and a regiment of riders.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.883
Then you've seen Jessica Drummond...

08:27.966 --> 08:31.220
the one I just sung about,
the one I wrote the ballad about.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.556
- Nobody around the Dragoons is allowed
to sing it. - So that's Drummond, huh?

08:34.640 --> 08:37.267
Yep. Boss of Cochise County.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.352
She and them 40 guns
that ride with her.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.813
Beautiful woman, ain't she, Griff?

08:41.938 --> 08:44.525
- Swain one of her 40 thieves?
- He sure is.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.993
- Howdy, Marshal.
- Howdy, Shotgun.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.496
- Going someplace?
- Just up the road a piece.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.624
- Hello, Marshal.
- Howdy, Miss Louvenia.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.553
Chisholm!

09:13.971 --> 09:15.973
Where you goin'?

09:17.599 --> 09:19.643
You're runnin' out, ain't ya?

09:23.188 --> 09:25.190
Please, Brockie! Please!

09:25.315 --> 09:27.276
Give me your coffee.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.988
Have some coffee, Marshal.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.789
Slap that leather, Marshal.

09:40.872 --> 09:44.293
Please, Brockie.
You don't know what you're doin', son.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.379
You're no gunfighter.
You're a mouth-fighter!

09:47.504 --> 09:51.633
- Now, pull that plough handle.
- Please, Brockie!

09:51.717 --> 09:54.303
Isn't there a sensible man here
that can stop this drunken...

09:54.386 --> 09:54.886
Dad!

10:10.485 --> 10:13.238
Now, that's a marshal for ya.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.741
Come on, Charlie.
Lets go have some fun.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.791
- How is he, Doc?
- He'll live, but he'll be stone blind.

11:05.916 --> 11:09.127
- Why didn't you take my advice, John?
- I did.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.296
You need a gun, Griff?
Mr. Spanger here...

11:11.421 --> 11:13.840
No, it's not my fight.

11:13.965 --> 11:16.635
- I'll put a stop to this.
- You can't tangle with 'em.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.720
Nobody's gonna wreck my shop.

11:18.804 --> 11:21.723
He's a gunsmith, not a gunfighter.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.357
Mr. Gunsmith!

11:32.651 --> 11:37.114
- Yes, Mr. Bonell?
- All right, Wes.

11:37.239 --> 11:41.660
- Where's your shop? - I'll be glad to show
you, Mr. Bonell. Come on! Come on!

11:41.743 --> 11:43.829
Let's break up the store.

11:43.954 --> 11:48.417
- Which one, Brockie?
- That one!

11:57.634 --> 11:59.761
Let me have a .44-40.

13:05.368 --> 13:09.706
Charlie! Charlie Savage!

13:24.721 --> 13:26.723
Look who's comin'.

13:30.101 --> 13:35.106
- I'm gettin' outta here.
- What's the matter, Charlie? You sick?

13:35.232 --> 13:37.901
There's only one man walks like that.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.447
When he gets closer, I'll skin him!

13:42.572 --> 13:45.909
What's the matter with you guys?
He's all alone!

13:48.203 --> 13:50.205
Aahh!

13:55.919 --> 13:59.089
Stand back, mister!
I'm givin' ya fair warning!

14:02.926 --> 14:05.387
Stand back, mister!

15:16.166 --> 15:18.585
Here.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.879
Thanks, Mr. Spanger.

15:21.004 --> 15:24.257
Oh, uh, here.

15:24.382 --> 15:28.136
- That's for the bullet. - It'll cost
you six bits to clean the rifle.

15:30.180 --> 15:35.393
Ya know, that rifle could
stand a little readjustment.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.813
I almost killed him. Yeah.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.031
She even looks good in overalls.

15:48.156 --> 15:51.034
- Who?
- Built like a .40-40.

15:51.159 --> 15:53.828
I'd like to stay around long enough
to clean her rifle.

15:53.912 --> 15:56.331
Wes, Chico, let's go!

15:58.166 --> 16:01.670
Can you see me a farm dog? Me...
I cut my teeth on a gun.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.172
They're still milk teeth.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.257
Remember what Pa says:

16:06.383 --> 16:09.094
”They who labour in the earth
are the chosen people of God."

16:09.219 --> 16:12.180
But I don't wanna be a chosen people.
I wanna be Griff's third gun.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.516
If he'd only give me a chance,
I wouldn't let you down.

16:14.599 --> 16:17.102
A man never knows what
he'll do in a showdown.

16:17.227 --> 16:20.146
- Were you ever scared?
- All the time.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.817
I got your ticket.
See that you don't lose it.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.528
I read in the paper there's been
lots of stagecoach accidents.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.781
Holdups... three and four a week.
Desperadoes killed all the passengers.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.950
They never bother women or boys.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.828
- If you were my size, I'd make you
eat that. - Excuse me, gentlemen.

16:34.953 --> 16:38.331
- Which one is Griff Bonell?
- What can I do for you?

16:38.456 --> 16:43.753
I'm Ned Logan, Mr. Bonell,
the sheriff of Cochise County.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.214
I guess you must be Wes, huh?

16:46.297 --> 16:48.425
Now, I'm sorry
a bunch of drunken rowdies...

16:48.508 --> 16:52.345
had to be your welcoming party, Mr. Bonell.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.597
- Staying in town long?
- Long enough.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.683
That Brockie's a spoiled kid.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.310
That pistol-whipping
ought to sober him up.

16:59.436 --> 17:02.272
- He's all yours.
- I don't want him.

17:02.397 --> 17:06.317
I just come to thank you for...
thank you for tossing him in jail.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.694
Too bad I wasn't around
to give old Chisholm a hand...

17:08.819 --> 17:12.866
but, you see, <i>I...</i> I had to
ride to the border on business.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.951
With all your deputies?

17:15.076 --> 17:17.494
Well, being sheriff and tax assessor...

17:17.619 --> 17:20.290
and collector all at the same time...

17:20.415 --> 17:22.751
a man needs plenty of help.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.878
<i>Cowmen have a way of
Wm' about the“ herds.</i>

17:29.424 --> 17:32.969
Yeah. It gets pretty tough sometimes
dodging Apaches when you have to...

17:33.094 --> 17:38.725
serve writs of attachment on outlying
ranches and mines and sawmills.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.810
Uh, you here on official business?

17:40.935 --> 17:43.521
Yes, I guess you do have
your hands full at that.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.982
Thinkin' of pounding
the hills for a little silver?

17:46.107 --> 17:48.151
Right now, I'm thinking
of pounding out a telegram.

17:48.276 --> 17:51.863
Oh, well, this is the place
right here to do it.

17:51.988 --> 17:55.241
Tex'll take care of you.
Tex, a friend of mine...

17:55.366 --> 17:58.078
wants to send a message.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.705
I seen you make the walk, Mr. Bonell.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.666
A little slower than that stroll
you took in Dodge City.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.794
Would you send that, please?

18:05.877 --> 18:07.879
Uh, ”To Nicholas Bonell."

18:08.004 --> 18:13.635
I was in the cavalry with a
Captain Nick Bonell in '47 in Mexico.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.805
He got hit in the leg
and was invalided home.

18:16.888 --> 18:20.225
- That was, uh, 34 years ago.
- He's my father.

18:20.350 --> 18:24.145
- Is the leg any better?
- It will be when he gets that telegram.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.815
"Nicholas Bonell, Colton, California.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.900
"All in good health.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.111
"Chico leaving Saturday.

18:31.236 --> 18:34.405
”Will write after we
complete our business here.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.741
- Signed, Griff and Wes."
- Thank you.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.120
Well, Mr. Bonell,
anything I can do for you, I'll be here.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.288
Thank you, Mr. Logan.

19:16.531 --> 19:19.242
Just a little bump
on the head, Jessica.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.912
Where's the man who
assaulted my brother?

19:23.037 --> 19:25.081
- I barrelled him.
- Why isn't he locked up?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.500
There was no charges against him.
You know who he is.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.753
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Bonell's
talents. A legal killer for hire.

19:30.879 --> 19:33.673
I'm surprised a man of his calibre
would put his brand on a calf.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.801
That calf was old enough to put
a .45 slug in a blind man's leg.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.887
- Blind?
- That's right.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.972
What are the charges
against Brockie Drummond?

19:41.097 --> 19:43.641
- Disturbing the peace.
- Disturbing the peace?

19:43.766 --> 19:45.727
He shot a man
who wouldn't draw on him.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.521
- Did you see it?
- No, but everybody knows it.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.274
The Honourable District and Circuit Court,
County of Cochise is now in session.

19:51.399 --> 19:55.445
Since no warrant was issued for the arrest of
the prisoner, the argument was a personal one.

19:55.570 --> 19:59.115
The prisoner produced signatures of
eyewitnesses swearing he shot in self-defence.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.534
Brockie Drummond, this court finds
you guilty of disturbing the peace.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.370
A $50 fine. Release the prisoner,
his guns and his horse.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.915
Court now stands adjourned.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.902
No wonder Marshal Chisholm
never gave us any trouble.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.952
He couldn't see.
Why did you shoot him?

20:44.035 --> 20:47.580
- Was it over that half-breed?
- I don't know what you mean.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.166
I don't want an unbranded calf in my corral
because of your carelessness...

20:50.291 --> 20:52.252
and I'm tired of paying
for your mistakes.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.587
- Did she go to you?
- Of course she did. They all do.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.799
You'll wind up with a woman in every
<i>placita</i> and a calf in every corral.

20:57.882 --> 21:01.761
Give me your gun.
- Sometimes a man's gotta blow off a little steam.

21:01.886 --> 21:05.223
If you can't handle a horse
without spurs, you have no business riding.

21:05.348 --> 21:07.350
Come on. Your guns.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.453
Rio!

21:52.228 --> 21:57.025
Why'd you run to my sister,
cry on her shoulder like the rest?

21:57.108 --> 22:00.445
No, Brockie, I'm not like the rest.

22:00.570 --> 22:04.240
Runnin' to her for help.
That makes you no different.

22:04.365 --> 22:07.076
Who could I go to, Brockie?

22:07.201 --> 22:09.245
Who could I turn to?

22:09.370 --> 22:14.292
You know I'm alone, and you wouldn't
see me anymore.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.586
I had to go to her.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.425
You know what you're gonna do?

22:22.550 --> 22:25.970
You're gonna go to my sister, and you're
gonna tell her I never touched you.

22:26.054 --> 22:30.016
No, Brockie.
I'm not going to lie to her.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.852
She was kind to me.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.937
She gave me money.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.565
She said she would
help me, and that...

22:37.648 --> 22:41.611
- You're gonna tell her it's a lie.
- No, Brockie.

22:47.325 --> 22:49.410
I ought to shove you right off this cliff.

22:49.494 --> 22:52.622
You do, and your bread and butter goes with me.
- If Jessica weren't your sister...

22:52.747 --> 22:55.249
You'll never get her, Logan.
You're too clumsy, too weak.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.335
You haven't got the stomach
for her kind of woman.

22:57.460 --> 23:00.671
I've wanted to kill you lots of times
for the trouble that you cause her.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.925
Why don't you grow up and stop
riding roughshod over these girls?

23:04.008 --> 23:07.178
You've got a chance to amount to something
with a woman like Jessica behind you.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.598
We paid Chisholm 300 a month.
We'd go to five to get you.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.518
- Just the name Bonell is worth the extra 200.
- Drop from line...

23:13.643 --> 23:16.687
of bore five-eighths to eleven-sixteenths
at comb for low mounting.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.898
Five-eighths to eleven-sixteenths.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.109
There are worse jobs
than being city marshal.

23:21.192 --> 23:24.278
Drop at heel between one
and one five-eighths.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.447
One and one five-eighths.

23:26.531 --> 23:29.409
It's time you settled down
in one place, Wes.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.494
This is good wood for the stock.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.830
Fiddleback grain. You don't want that.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.998
Give me that new walnut
that just came in, Dad.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.459
That, uh, flame grain.

23:38.543 --> 23:40.628
This what you mean?

23:43.131 --> 23:45.174
- Looks pretty good.
- Yeah?

23:45.299 --> 23:49.262
- Just fine.
- First time I ever been measured for a rifle.

23:49.387 --> 23:52.598
You've got a high cheekbone
and a low shoulder.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.978
Gonna make trouble for you?

23:57.061 --> 23:59.939
Nothing I can't handle.

24:00.064 --> 24:02.733
How long will it take
to make this rifle for me?

24:02.859 --> 24:06.779
A long time. You'll have to come in
every day for a fittin'.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.740
Yeah?

24:09.866 --> 24:13.244
I guess it is time I settled down.

24:13.369 --> 24:16.164
But this town looks like any other town.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.041
A Spanger rifle looks
like any other rifle...

24:19.167 --> 24:21.210
unless you know good work from bad.

24:21.335 --> 24:26.632
This is pretty good work.
Never saw any better.

24:26.757 --> 24:31.179
Yeah. This kind of rifle's
worth hangin' around for.

24:36.601 --> 24:39.604
I never kissed a gunsmith before.

24:39.729 --> 24:41.731
Any recoil?

24:53.576 --> 24:55.578
Whoa!

25:17.475 --> 25:19.560
Whoa.

25:31.739 --> 25:35.326
I have a warrant for
one of your men, Miss Drummond.

25:35.451 --> 25:38.538
Would you mind passing it down, please?

26:12.280 --> 26:14.490
Mr. Connelly,
does the governor know about this?

26:14.615 --> 26:16.701
It didn't come through
our office in Prescott.

26:16.826 --> 26:20.663
- Judge Macy?
- It's not a local warrant.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.666
- Is it in order?
- Yes, I think so.

26:23.791 --> 26:26.711
It should be. It came direct from the
attorney general's office in Washington.

26:26.836 --> 26:29.171
Mr. Logan, it's a reflection on you...

26:29.255 --> 26:32.717
for one of your own deputies
to be charged with robbing the mails.

26:32.800 --> 26:37.722
I'm sure he will surrender to the United
States government without resistance.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.516
- Won't you, Mr. Swain?
- What are you talkin' about?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.893
Are you Chief Deputy Swain?

26:43.019 --> 26:47.189
That's right.
- Then you know what I'm talking about. Let's go.

26:47.315 --> 26:50.568
You heard Mr. Bonell. Go with him.

27:15.801 --> 27:19.555
One moment, please, Mr. Bonell.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.891
Aren't you afraid of ambush?

27:21.974 --> 27:24.935
I'm always afraid of losing government
property. Keeps me awake nights.

27:25.061 --> 27:27.647
That's hard to believe after
what I've heard about you.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.899
Just as hard for me to swallow
what I've heard about you.

27:29.982 --> 27:34.445
Oh? And just what did you hear?

27:40.451 --> 27:45.373
Would you gentlemen excuse us, please?

28:33.087 --> 28:35.589
The whiskey's in the sideboard.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.980
My reputation is going to suffer.

28:51.105 --> 28:53.983
A deputy charged with robbing
the mails is hard to believe.

28:54.108 --> 28:56.861
And I once arrested a lieutenant governor.
Horse thief.

28:56.986 --> 29:00.322
- Don't forget this.
- I've got lots more of 'em.

29:00.406 --> 29:05.161
- For my guests?
- Any more of 'em been robbing the mails?

29:05.244 --> 29:08.247
Now, what did you want?

29:08.372 --> 29:11.250
Logan wears the badge,
but he's afraid of guns.

29:11.375 --> 29:15.880
The job pays well. Percentage
on commissions, and so forth.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.674
And a man could get rich
on the ”and so forth". Is that it?

29:18.758 --> 29:22.219
You offering me the job?
- You wouldn't have any trouble getting elected.

29:22.344 --> 29:27.349
With your help?
- With or without my help, a popular killer like you.

29:27.475 --> 29:29.935
I don't figure the job is my size.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.730
It could be any size you want it to be.

29:32.855 --> 29:38.068
I'm not interested in you, Mr. Bonell.
It's your trademark.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.780
- May I feel it?
- Uh-uh.

29:40.905 --> 29:44.700
- Just curious.
- It might go off in your face.

29:44.825 --> 29:46.827
I'll take a chance.

29:55.002 --> 29:57.129
You could have broken my brother's skull.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.757
I could have, if I tried.

29:59.882 --> 30:04.053
I suppose I should be grateful
you weren't hired to kill him.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.139
I don't kill for hire.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.809
I'm sure you don't kill for fun.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.062
I'm sure you're sure.

30:16.273 --> 30:18.317
You asked for the whiskey.

30:28.369 --> 30:31.247
That's good whiskey, Logan.
You oughta try it.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.444
Whoa.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.281
You check him in, Wes.
I'll see you at the hotel.

31:17.793 --> 31:22.131
I disliked leavin' Miss Drummond's
peaceful dinner party, Mr. Bonell...

31:22.214 --> 31:27.678
but as sheriff, I had to be back here
in my official capacity.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.805
I appreciate that, Sheriff.

31:29.930 --> 31:33.809
Give the prisoner anything he wants.
Room and board's on Uncle Sam.

31:33.893 --> 31:36.145
Swain, <i>I...</i> I can't believe it.

31:36.228 --> 31:40.900
Honest to goodness, a man in your position.

31:41.025 --> 31:45.321
Here you are drawin' clean pay
every month, and you rob the mails.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.324
You oughta go to a head doctor.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.619
Excuse me. Come on.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.083
How long does this...

32:02.087 --> 32:04.089
this idiot got to board with us?

32:04.214 --> 32:06.258
A couple of days, Sheriff.

32:09.386 --> 32:11.430
Mr. Bonell...

32:18.520 --> 32:22.107
Why don't you save the government
some money, hang him right now?

32:22.232 --> 32:25.069
I wish I could, Sheriff,
but it's out of our jurisdiction.

32:25.194 --> 32:30.115
Uh-huh. Did...
Did he do this all by himself?

32:30.240 --> 32:32.534
I know how miserable you feel, Sheriff.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.371
His kind puts a damper on
all peace officers in the county.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.915
- I know that.
- It's true.

32:37.998 --> 32:41.627
This is to bind him over to the attorney general.
- Oh?

32:41.752 --> 32:44.797
Everything's gotta be read and signed.

32:47.341 --> 32:51.220
- All of them. Government regulations.
- Of course. Yeah.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.306
I'll pick 'em up later, with the prisoner.

33:15.703 --> 33:17.705
Chico?

33:23.168 --> 33:25.212
Chico!

33:34.138 --> 33:36.181
Chico!

33:37.933 --> 33:42.771
- Barney! Barney Cashman!
- Yeah?

33:42.896 --> 33:44.815
Barney, come here.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.695
- Yeah? What is it?
- Where's Chico?

33:49.820 --> 33:51.780
The last I saw him,
he was headed for a drink.

33:51.905 --> 33:54.033
He never touched the stuff.
I told you to keep an eye on him.

33:54.158 --> 33:56.660
- Is Griff Bonell up there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

33:56.785 --> 34:00.497
We've got your brother Chico.
Where do you want us to put the body?

34:03.292 --> 34:06.378
We're with the First Division.
We came down here to have some fun.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.464
But your brother here
drank up half the whiskey.

34:08.589 --> 34:10.549
And he wrecked the whole
place doin' it.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.717
Thank you, boys.
Thanks, Corporal. Barney.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.222
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Good night.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.864
I can figure a squirt like Brockie Drummond
getting liquored up.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.949
He was born that way... scared and loud.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.994
But you going off half-cocked
like that... Why, Chico?

34:39.078 --> 34:42.371
- I'm old enough to drink.
- You're not old enough to hold it.

34:42.498 --> 34:45.167
- Then I'll learn.
- Why?

34:45.250 --> 34:47.293
That's my business.

34:48.837 --> 34:53.300
Chico. Chico, what's bothering you?

34:55.552 --> 34:59.848
Why do you think I came to Tombstone
with you? For the ride?

34:59.973 --> 35:02.059
You pistol-whipped a man...

35:02.184 --> 35:05.938
wouldn't let me be part of the play.

35:06.063 --> 35:09.024
What if something happened to Wes?

35:09.108 --> 35:13.237
You know you'd never make the walk
without a second gun covering you.

35:13.362 --> 35:17.616
You rode out to the Dragoons, and
you wouldn't let me be in on the arrest.

35:17.741 --> 35:21.161
I feel like a third leg.

35:21.286 --> 35:25.541
- Did I hurt you, Chico?
- No.

35:25.666 --> 35:29.461
I got no taste for farmin'.
I don't want any part of it.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.630
Why?

35:34.383 --> 35:36.802
You learned me to handle a gun.

35:36.927 --> 35:40.055
You learned me too good.

35:40.139 --> 35:43.892
Chico, you know
what happened to Chisholm.

35:44.017 --> 35:47.229
It could happen to you,
could happen to me.

35:47.354 --> 35:50.899
Remember when I told you how those Roman
fighters used to chop each other up...

35:51.024 --> 35:55.737
in some big arena, and you laughed
and called them freaks?

35:55.863 --> 35:59.867
It won't be long now before people
will be laughing at men like me.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.578
The last few towns we rode through,
they looked at my gun.

36:02.703 --> 36:06.206
I know they figured I was one
of those freaks out of the past.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.584
There's a new era coming up, Chico.

36:08.709 --> 36:12.671
My kind of making a living
is on the way out.

36:12.796 --> 36:16.466
For a gunfighter, you do an awful lot of talking.
- I'm a freak, Chico!

36:18.969 --> 36:21.263
I just don't want you to be one.

36:21.346 --> 36:24.016
Well, I'm tired of being wet-nosed.

36:24.141 --> 36:27.477
I'm no agricultural cowboy.

36:27.603 --> 36:29.646
I know.

36:43.076 --> 36:46.330
A brand new .45 Colt Peacemaker.

36:46.455 --> 36:51.793
Nickel-plated, ivory stock. For me?

36:51.877 --> 36:53.879
It's for killing rattlesnakes
and wild animals.

36:54.004 --> 36:56.173
You'll find plenty
of both of 'em on the farm.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.467
Well, you tell her this from me:

36:58.550 --> 37:00.510
She can't buy me off like the others.

37:00.636 --> 37:03.680
I'm not making a target
out of myself for her or anyone else.

37:03.805 --> 37:07.476
That Griff Bonell... Do you think
he cares anything about the border?

37:07.559 --> 37:09.519
He'd find me wherever I go...
he and his brother.

37:09.645 --> 37:11.605
And if they didn't,
someone else would.

37:11.730 --> 37:15.317
Swain, look, she's got influence.
You know that, don't you?

37:15.442 --> 37:18.195
She'll pull strings for you
later on. Sure. Sure.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.364
Later's too late.

37:20.489 --> 37:23.075
She's getting me out of here
right away, and legally.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.495
Tomorrow I wanna walk
the street. I'm still chief deputy.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.664
She can swing it, she's the boss.

37:28.747 --> 37:34.086
And if she doesn't, remember there
isn't anything about her I don't know.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.550
You want me to tell her that?

37:50.227 --> 37:52.521
- You're sure?
- You heard me.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.584
Who shot you, Swain? Who shot you?

38:14.710 --> 38:18.297
Did you see him at all? Did you?
Who shot you in the back?

38:18.422 --> 38:21.383
You can tell me if you saw him, 'cause
I'm your friend. You know that, don't you?

38:21.466 --> 38:23.552
If you saw him, we'll
do something about it.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.597
Don't you know who shot you?

38:27.723 --> 38:30.892
- Straighten out my legs.
- They are straight.

38:30.976 --> 38:34.396
I think his spine is busted, don't you?

38:34.479 --> 38:36.898
He-he-he's trying to say something.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.401
D-did you see who shot you? Did you?

38:39.526 --> 38:42.446
If you saw him, why-why don't you tell us?

38:42.571 --> 38:46.158
We'll... we'll find out who
did it, won't we, Mr. Bonell?

38:52.539 --> 38:56.460
Did he... did he whisper to you at all?
Did he... did he tell you who did it?

38:56.543 --> 38:58.670
Did he, Mr. Bonell?

38:58.795 --> 39:02.507
Cut the slug out, Wes.
It's no good to us in a corpse.

39:08.805 --> 39:10.849
Excuse me, Sheriff.

39:31.661 --> 39:34.748
Did you ever see this slug before?

39:37.751 --> 39:40.379
Sure. It comes from
a new high-powered rifle.

39:40.504 --> 39:42.631
Sharps-Borchardt makes it.

39:42.756 --> 39:47.219
- Seen any around here?
- Only one man in the territory has one like it.

39:47.344 --> 39:50.806
- Who's that?
- The late Howard Swain.

39:50.931 --> 39:53.892
This slug was just cut out of his spine.

39:54.017 --> 39:57.979
Then he must've been shot with his own gun.

39:58.105 --> 40:01.358
Who's the best shot in the territory?

40:01.483 --> 40:03.902
- I didn't shoot him.
- No.

40:04.027 --> 40:06.655
After you, who's the best shot?

40:07.697 --> 40:09.616
Charlie Savage.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.412
You got in a panic.

40:13.537 --> 40:16.998
But I had to act fast,
and Charlie Savage is your best shot.

40:17.124 --> 40:20.085
- You made a decision for me?
- Sometimes, you know, a partner can't wait.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.254
I'm your boss, not your partner.

40:22.379 --> 40:24.756
You want me to crawl?
I didn't know you'd take it like this.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.842
How do you think
Griff Bonell will take it?

40:26.967 --> 40:29.219
But you're in the clear.
Everything's all been settled.

40:29.344 --> 40:32.224
Murder never solved anything.
It was your decision, and it's your finish.

40:32.264 --> 40:36.560
- You had Swain killed, not me.
- Yes, but I had no other choice.

40:36.685 --> 40:39.312
You just hanged yourself.

40:41.314 --> 40:43.275
Start running, Logan.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.403
Start running like a feist dog
with your tail between your legs.

40:46.528 --> 40:49.573
- Please, Jessica...
- Take your gun hawks and run!

41:15.682 --> 41:17.642
You must feel naked without your army.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.728
The Dragoons is at your disposal.

41:19.853 --> 41:21.813
What name is on your warrant this time?

41:21.938 --> 41:24.566
- One of your riders, Charlie Savage.
- Oh? What did he do?

41:24.691 --> 41:26.985
Just damaged some federal property.
You seen him around?

41:27.110 --> 41:29.070
I don't keep track of my men, Mr. Bonell...

41:29.196 --> 41:32.407
and I'm not responsible
for what they do away from here.

41:32.491 --> 41:34.743
Must be plenty of good
hiding places on your land.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.496
- I'll be glad to show them to you.
- Can you spare the time?

41:37.621 --> 41:40.582
I wanna see if you find him on my land.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.709
You wanna spank him?

41:42.834 --> 41:45.545
I just wanna see if you can take him.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.720
There's a good hideout.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.441
Whoa. Whoa.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.237
Whoa!

42:33.426 --> 42:36.763
I was bitten by a rattler
in there when I was 15.

42:39.182 --> 42:42.644
- Bet that rattler died.
- Yeah, I bet he did.

42:42.769 --> 42:45.689
- You don't think much of me, do you?
- No, I think a lot of you.

42:45.772 --> 42:49.025
I think it's gonna be rough on you
if your brother's mixed up in this killing.

42:49.150 --> 42:53.905
Murder is not in his blood.
- With your brand on him, anything could be in his blood.

43:00.245 --> 43:02.289
Hyah!

43:20.890 --> 43:22.892
Whoa. Whoa.

43:23.018 --> 43:25.604
- What's the matter? You look upset.
- I was born upset.

46:54.187 --> 46:58.316
Until I was eight, I thought everything
with four feet and horns was a cow...

46:58.441 --> 47:01.444
and everything with two feet
and a gun was a man.

47:01.569 --> 47:04.531
At nine, I learned the difference.

47:04.656 --> 47:10.578
Not between beef and men,
but between cold blood and breeding.

47:10.662 --> 47:15.291
At 10, I branded calves, peeled horses...

47:15.416 --> 47:19.420
rode the range and slept on the ground.

47:19.504 --> 47:23.007
My father was rounding up
strays when Brockie was born.

47:23.132 --> 47:27.011
I was alone with my mother.
I was 12. I delivered him.

47:27.136 --> 47:29.848
He was born in this shack.

47:29.973 --> 47:32.934
My mother died giving birth.

47:33.059 --> 47:37.647
I buried her, went out
and roped a cow, got milk for Brockie.

47:37.772 --> 47:39.816
He lived.

47:41.818 --> 47:45.446
When I was 15, a saddletramp
tried to get rough with me in here.

47:45.572 --> 47:47.782
The rattler?

47:47.907 --> 47:51.286
My father
was no hand with a gun.

47:51.411 --> 47:54.706
He was shot trying to
keep me from getting bit.

48:00.503 --> 48:04.841
- Did you step on the rattler?
- Mm-hmm.

48:04.966 --> 48:08.928
My father built this shack
with his own hands.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.306
And you've kept it as a shrine.

48:11.389 --> 48:14.350
No.

48:14.434 --> 48:18.730
Just a reminder not to let go of anything.

48:18.855 --> 48:21.649
When I was 18, I was boss of my own spread.

48:21.774 --> 48:24.819
I picked up Logan, a $100-a-month
sheriff in a broken-down camp.

48:24.944 --> 48:29.490
I put him on. I got interested
in voting, taxes and silver.

48:29.616 --> 48:32.911
I spent money for
the good of this territory...

48:33.036 --> 48:36.956
sent lobbyists to the Prescott Council,
financed mining camps, sawmills.

48:37.081 --> 48:40.543
- You came a long way.
- So have you.

48:40.668 --> 48:43.379
My men talk a lot about you.

48:43.504 --> 48:47.592
Did they ever tell you I drove most of 'em
out of different camps, one time or another?

48:47.717 --> 48:51.054
Those you didn't draw on told me.

48:51.179 --> 48:53.848
You shot your way across the map.

48:55.350 --> 48:58.186
This is the last stop, Griff.

48:58.269 --> 49:01.105
The frontier is finished.

49:01.230 --> 49:04.984
There'll be no more towns
to break, no more men to break.

49:06.402 --> 49:08.821
It's time you started to break yourself.

49:11.407 --> 49:16.037
If a town has got to have peace, let
somebody else build it on graves.

49:16.162 --> 49:20.166
You don't want the only evidence of
your life's work to be bullet holes in men.

49:22.293 --> 49:25.964
I want you to run the Dragoons for me.

49:26.089 --> 49:30.259
- I want you to throw in with me.
- You still interested in my gun?

49:30.385 --> 49:32.345
It's time you threw your gun away.

49:32.470 --> 49:35.807
You'll have to sooner or later.
I'm giving you the chance.

49:35.932 --> 49:38.226
Why me?

49:38.309 --> 49:41.896
I need a strong man to carry out my orders.

49:42.021 --> 49:45.733
And a weak man to take them.

49:45.817 --> 49:48.820
My throat's dry. I'm talking too much.

50:00.540 --> 50:05.253
What do you want?
- You'd better not let her catch you wearing those guns.

50:05.336 --> 50:07.797
You're not giving orders for her anymore.

50:07.880 --> 50:11.092
Nothing would give me greater pleasure than
to watch Griff Bonell blow your head off...

50:11.217 --> 50:13.857
- but then she'd blame me for it.
- I wanna be the one to kill him.

50:13.928 --> 50:15.888
Look, nobody wants to kill him, Brockie...

50:16.014 --> 50:18.094
but the pressure's gotta
come off her and off me too.

50:18.099 --> 50:20.476
Everything's gonna be like
it was. Give me those guns!

50:20.601 --> 50:23.271
I already gave up these guns once
to her. Nobody else is gonna take 'em.

50:23.354 --> 50:25.690
This is Charlie Savage's play
and nobody else's.

50:25.815 --> 50:28.484
Don't you see, if we're mixed up
in it, she's mixed up in it too?

50:28.609 --> 50:31.446
- Give me the guns, Brockie.
- All right.

50:31.529 --> 50:34.699
Then I want you to get across
the street and wait for me over there.

50:34.824 --> 50:38.745
- Who's gonna face Griff Bonell?
- Wiley. Come on. Get out of here.

50:44.709 --> 50:48.046
Wiley. Wiley.

50:52.967 --> 50:56.054
Wiley. Wiley.

50:56.179 --> 50:58.222
Come on out here.

51:00.725 --> 51:05.188
- I don't like it, Sheriff.
- Absolutely nothing to worry about.

51:05.313 --> 51:09.067
You see, Wes'll come in first...

51:09.192 --> 51:13.821
as he always does, with a rifle
to look the situation over.

51:13.905 --> 51:18.993
Then he'll plant himself somewhere
around here to cover Griff's back.

51:19.077 --> 51:21.120
Now...

51:22.413 --> 51:25.541
Then, you see, Griff will come in.

51:25.666 --> 51:29.087
He'll stop right here. He's cautious.

51:29.212 --> 51:33.341
Now, Wiley, you've got
nothing to worry about at all...

51:33.466 --> 51:37.845
because, you know, you're gonna be... you're
gonna be right here around the corner.

51:37.929 --> 51:40.056
They can't... can't see you at all.

51:40.181 --> 51:45.144
Now, listen, Griff will call out,
"Charlie Savage".

51:45.269 --> 51:47.230
And you say, ”Yeah?"

51:47.355 --> 51:50.274
Then he'll call out
he's got a warrant for you.

51:50.399 --> 51:52.860
And you say, ”Come and get me."

51:52.944 --> 51:56.405
And he'll say, ”All right".

51:56.531 --> 51:58.574
<i>Now, look.</i>

52:02.954 --> 52:05.873
Griff will take that one step.

52:05.957 --> 52:09.544
That's what I mean. That's when
he'll see I'm not Charlie Savage.

52:13.005 --> 52:16.134
That's when he'll be dead.

52:24.642 --> 52:28.396
- Any luck?
- No. No word on him in Phoenix or Prescott.

52:28.479 --> 52:32.733
What about Tucson?
- They think he may have slipped across the border.

52:32.817 --> 52:36.571
Griff!

52:36.654 --> 52:39.115
I've been looking all over for you.
Charlie Savage is in town.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.409
He's over at the Undertaker's Alley
waiting for a showdown.

52:41.492 --> 52:43.786
- Where's that?
- Across from the gunsmith's shop.

52:43.911 --> 52:47.790
- Who told you he was in town waiting for me?
- Savage. Charlie Savage did.

52:47.915 --> 52:49.876
- He don't look scared.
- Thanks, Barney.

52:50.001 --> 52:52.253
- Come on!
- It's all right, Barney.

52:52.336 --> 52:54.422
- Can I help?
- You go back and run your bathhouse.

52:54.547 --> 52:57.967
- I'll call you if I need you.
- All right, but don't forget.

53:01.387 --> 53:05.099
Well, let's take a walk.

53:05.183 --> 53:08.603
No. We'd better wait until
we get Chico on that stage.

53:08.686 --> 53:10.479
Get him out of town.

53:10.813 --> 53:13.858
Here you are. Hey, Griff.

53:18.404 --> 53:20.489
Barney Cashman's been
lookin' for you. What's up?

53:20.615 --> 53:22.575
Not a thing.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.744
In you 80-

53:30.082 --> 53:34.003
- It might take a couple clays to find out
where Charlie Savage is holing up. - Yep.

53:34.128 --> 53:36.589
- Might even take you a week.
- Yeah.

53:36.714 --> 53:40.134
- Can't I stick around till you run him down?
- Nope.

53:40.218 --> 53:43.512
- Aw, come on, Griff.
- Say hello to the folks.

53:43.638 --> 53:47.725
Tell 'em we'll come home for a visit soon,
maybe in the next few weeks.

53:47.850 --> 53:50.561
Tell them I got a surprise for 'em.

53:56.359 --> 53:59.195
You know, he really would
have made a good third gun.

54:01.322 --> 54:03.574
What's this about a surprise?

54:03.699 --> 54:06.077
I'm gettin' married.

54:06.202 --> 54:09.038
Well, you won't find
many wives who can make a gun.

54:09.163 --> 54:11.374
That's right.

54:11.499 --> 54:14.210
Are you, uh, gonna stick around here?

54:14.335 --> 54:18.047
Yeah. I'm gonna be city marshal.

54:18.172 --> 54:20.216
Pay any good?

54:20.341 --> 54:24.011
Oh, better than a federal job.

54:24.095 --> 54:28.557
Anyway, they want
the Bonell name for the job.

54:28.641 --> 54:32.103
You know, after you pick up Charlie Savage,
you'll need a new second gun.

54:32.228 --> 54:34.272
Yeah, that's right.

55:48.471 --> 55:51.474
Charlie Savage in there?

55:58.731 --> 56:01.859
Charlie Savage!

56:04.362 --> 56:08.366
- Charlie Savage!
- Yeah?

56:08.491 --> 56:11.660
This is Griff Bonell.
I've got a warrant for you.

56:11.786 --> 56:16.123
Get rid of your gun, and come out with
your hands high and your fingers spread.

56:23.881 --> 56:27.176
Did you hear me?

56:29.804 --> 56:32.598
Come on out!

56:39.688 --> 56:43.776
Come... and get me.

56:47.363 --> 56:49.407
All right.

56:58.707 --> 57:02.503
So you <i>did</i> need a third gun.
He had you right in his sights.

57:02.628 --> 57:05.047
Who is it?

57:05.172 --> 57:07.925
Charlie Savage.

57:14.765 --> 57:17.184
Barney Cashman told me
he was calling for a showdown.

57:17.309 --> 57:20.521
I jumped the stage
as soon as it turned the corner.

57:20.604 --> 57:23.524
I got him right
through the head. One shot.

57:23.649 --> 57:27.153
And you wanted me to be a farmer.

57:29.405 --> 57:32.950
- Now what did I do wrong?
- Now you've killed a man.

57:56.807 --> 57:59.935
- Murdered!
- He didn't die of old age.

58:00.060 --> 58:03.063
- I'll find out who rigged this up.
- Here!

58:03.189 --> 58:07.902
You're not gonna make this a personal fight,
not so long as I made you my second gun.

58:07.985 --> 58:10.112
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

58:27.463 --> 58:30.424
Sure fix 'em up pretty in this camp.

58:33.302 --> 58:38.265
Last time I killed a man was 10 years ago.

58:38.390 --> 58:40.809
A boy.

58:40.935 --> 58:43.270
He was no good, like your brother.

58:43.395 --> 58:45.689
But he was still a boy, and I killed him.

58:45.814 --> 58:49.151
I could have made a crippling shot,
but I didn't.

58:49.276 --> 58:53.155
Did you ever see a dead boy's eyes
in the sky?

58:53.280 --> 58:57.243
Truest gun in the West. Hah.

58:59.203 --> 59:01.872
You know why I hate
to get into fights?

59:01.997 --> 59:05.209
I can't miss.
Am I talking too much?

59:07.086 --> 59:10.130
In my heart, I've always asked
forgiveness before I killed...

59:10.214 --> 59:14.218
just like an Indian asking forgiveness
from an animal before the slaughter.

59:14.343 --> 59:17.638
You can't ask after you kill.
It's too late then.

59:19.181 --> 59:21.350
I didn't come here to talk about that.

59:21.475 --> 59:23.727
I came to talk about Brockie.

59:23.852 --> 59:28.899
He put Charlie Savage's corpse
on public display in a store window.

59:29.024 --> 59:32.152
A boy who'd do a thing like that is dead.

59:32.278 --> 59:34.238
Or nearly dead.

59:34.363 --> 59:36.323
But there's still time.

59:36.448 --> 59:39.660
You think he was mixed up in that ambush.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.497
I don't know what to think.

59:43.581 --> 59:46.333
♪ My brother Wes is getting married.

59:46.458 --> 59:48.919
I'm pulling out
right after the wedding.

59:49.044 --> 59:51.922
That's why I'm here...
to talk about Brockie.

59:52.047 --> 59:54.508
I know how close you are to him,

59:54.633 --> 59:56.719
more like a son than a brother.

59:56.844 --> 59:59.805
I know. I've got
a brother the same age.

59:59.930 --> 01:00:03.976
You can break yours before you have to
bury him. -

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:12.026
Sorry, Jessica, but...
but I had to shoot him.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.446
There was no other possible way to...

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.127
Why didn't you kill me?

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:33.047
He thought you were my brother.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.592
Nobody wants to be associated with murder.

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:39.762
Now Swain is dead. Savage is dead.

01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:42.056
Your agent on the senate floor ran off.

01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:44.391
The governor turned his back on you.

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:47.478
Everybody's desertin' the ship.
The captain is drowning.

01:00:47.603 --> 01:00:50.606
The Dragoons are breakin'
up, and it's his fault.

01:00:50.731 --> 01:00:54.151
He's your enemy. He's out to crush you.
That's why I tried to kill him.

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:57.655
To get your job back?
Have you gone crazy?

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:01.659
Job?

01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:09.083
Why do you think I lied for you,
stole, bribed and cheated?

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:11.669
For my job? For money?

01:01:13.796 --> 01:01:16.256
Jessica, I'm a man.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.967
I have a man's feelings.

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:22.012
You can't buy what I feel.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:25.599
A man can't keep this
to himself forever.

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:31.146
I kept telling myself, "Patience.
Hold on. Hold fast. She'll understand."

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:35.484
But a man can only wait
for so long.

01:01:36.819 --> 01:01:40.030
And a man has got to do
something...

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:44.034
about what's in his heart,
or it'll break.

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:49.373
What do you want to do with him?

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:52.835
Nothing.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.344

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:04.722
Jessica, don't do that to me.

01:02:04.847 --> 01:02:08.976
Please, Jessica, don't...
don't pay me off like the others.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.311
Please, Jessica.

01:02:11.437 --> 01:02:14.732
Jessica, don't do that.

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:26.326
Please.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.662
Jessica, please.

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:30.956
I'm sorry, Ned.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:58.567
You know the real reason
why he tried to kill you.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.028
He knows I'm in love with you.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:07.242
Everything he said is true. The Dragoons
is crumbling, but I don't care anymore.

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:10.537
I could save it, but I don't want to.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:13.415
I know how he feels.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.877
He feels about me the way I feel about you.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:22.299
But we can forget him now,
and everything else...

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:26.637
the boy you've killed,
the life I've led, everything.

01:03:26.762 --> 01:03:28.972
Nothing can hurt us now.

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.975
You're not leaving here without me, Griff.

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:38.524
What's happened to us is like war...

01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:43.445
easy to start, hard to stop.

01:03:45.906 --> 01:03:50.035
I never knew how to like anybody
until I knew how to love.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.374
And I like you, Griff.

01:04:08.804 --> 01:04:11.807
- What's that?
- Nothing. Nothing.

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:22.609
We'd better take a look.

01:05:10.157 --> 01:05:13.243
I want those church bells ringin', Sexton.

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:16.330
Don't you worry about 'em.
They'll be ringing.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.416
And you, Mr. Fly, you better
make this your best job.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:23.587
First time I had to wash to take
a wedding picture, Mr. Spanger.

01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:27.049
- Have you gotten plenty of rice?
- Every bag in camp.

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:53.742
Here they come! Here they come!

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:02.960
Will you come in a little closer, please?

01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:07.047
All right, here we go.

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:16.640
Hold it!

01:06:16.765 --> 01:06:19.393
One more!
