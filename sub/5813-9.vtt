00:03.128 --> 00:04.129
Something's changed.

00:04.296 --> 00:06.173
It's big. Big as God. Big as Lucifer.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.500
Someone's gotta do something.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.059
Someone?

00:09.218 --> 00:11.312
Amara? I am what you are becoming.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.893
- God locked me away.
- All for his own ego.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.900
- You must stay fixed on our purpose.
- What's that?

00:17.059 --> 00:18.060
Settle an old score.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.228
Hello, Dean.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.614
My girl's grown up.

00:22.773 --> 00:26.619
I'll spare your life on one condition.
Safe passage for Dean out of here.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.654
Yes!

00:28.820 --> 00:29.946
Amara is in the wind.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.114
How'd she get away?

00:31.281 --> 00:33.079
What part of "God's freaking sister"
did you not understand?

00:33.242 --> 00:34.762
We will always help each other.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.388
I don't suppose God's decided to share
any wisdom on the matter?

00:37.829 --> 00:39.456
There's this cage in Hell.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.967
And it's where they keep Lucifer
and I've been in it.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.129
And I think God wants me to go back.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.815
Not happening. We'll find another way.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.050
What is the other way?

00:56.473 --> 00:58.646
Repent your sins!

00:58.809 --> 00:59.810
Yes!

00:59.977 --> 01:02.730
Beg for his divine mercy!

01:03.730 --> 01:06.859
When the end comes, and come it will,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.329
only the forgiven
will ascend to holy grace!

01:12.698 --> 01:15.042
He is watching! He is waiting!

01:15.617 --> 01:17.494
This is God you're speaking of?

01:19.663 --> 01:21.023
Do you really think he's watching?

01:22.749 --> 01:28.802
Deciding which of us is worthy.
Only the chosen will be raised to heaven.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.346
Oh, and that's you?

01:32.426 --> 01:35.680
Truthfully, I don't think
He's all that interested.

01:35.846 --> 01:38.645
He doesn't even seem to be around.
Believe me, I've searched.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.184
Stop right there, sister.

01:40.851 --> 01:45.197
Beg for his forgiveness.
Or face his terrible wrath.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.697
Really. Gets annoyed, does He?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.657
His wrath comes in many forms.

01:51.320 --> 01:56.668
But only God is able to create
the fearsome plague and destruction

01:56.825 --> 01:59.749
that all on Earth must bow before.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.505
You mean something like this?

02:17.471 --> 02:21.567
Is it... You? Are you testing us?

02:23.977 --> 02:25.103
God, you mean?

02:25.270 --> 02:30.367
No. But let's just say,
he's not the only game in town.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.364
Oh, honey, you wish.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.780
Well?

04:05.203 --> 04:09.083
Is this really the answer?
Is this what you want?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.350
Because it's crazy, okay?
And it's not gonna happen.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.359
How many times do I have to say
that this is a horrible idea?

04:28.518 --> 04:31.362
About as many times as I have to say,
"Okay, then what else we got?"

04:32.063 --> 04:33.906
Listen, I'm all ears.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.576
Dean, ordinarily, I'd agree with you

04:36.735 --> 04:39.158
but the visions only happen
when I reach out to God.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.533
I asked him for a way to beat the Darkness
and the visions got more specific.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.752
And I was in the Cage.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.083
Yeah, with Lucifer.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.589
The biggest monster ever hatched.
Fan-friggin-tastic.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.068
You know what? Lucifer was
the biggest monster ever hatched

04:52.250 --> 04:54.378
until you and I hatched
one that's even worse.

04:56.421 --> 05:00.051
Listen, in the vision, Lucifer

05:01.676 --> 05:03.053
touches me.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.643
And I feel calm.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.233
Like things will be all right.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.732
And that's not something
I would ever come up with.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.401
I mean that is the last thing
I would ever think.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.986
Yeah, if Lucifer touched you,
it would be the last thing you'd think.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.150
Even

05:19.611 --> 05:21.731
Why would God even ask this of you?
And you know what?

05:21.738 --> 05:24.742
What proof do we have
that any of this is actually real?

05:26.493 --> 05:28.495
There was a burning bush.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.584
A burning bush.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.671
Like in the Bible.

05:35.126 --> 05:38.881
You were in a forest.
There are bushes there.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.098
And sometimes they burn!

05:44.678 --> 05:45.679
You know what, man?

05:46.513 --> 05:50.268
Maybe there is something to it all. Maybe.
And maybe there's not.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.978
Dean, doesn't it make sense?

05:53.228 --> 05:57.608
I mean, Lucifer would know how God ended
the Darkness. He was there.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.036
So God assured you of this, did He?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.661
I'd say you were making this up, I mean
I never think of you as imaginative.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.212
We're not saying it's gonna happen,
we just want to know...

06:15.375 --> 06:18.254
- Theoretically.
- If it's possible.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.420
The Cage is a can of worms
you do not want to open.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.904
I believe this conversation is over.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.180
Is it?

06:25.844 --> 06:28.142
Crowley, you know that the Darkness is
gonna pound on everything

06:28.305 --> 06:29.477
and that includes you.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.241
Yeah. And you had a shot at taking her out
when she was with you,

06:32.392 --> 06:34.592
but apparently
you thought sucking up was the way to go.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.089
But that didn't work out so well.

06:37.063 --> 06:40.943
Because she chose you.
And you couldn't control your girlfriend.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.532
What happened in that room?

06:43.695 --> 06:46.164
Why did she insist on sparing you?

06:49.451 --> 06:50.452
What is she to you?

06:56.374 --> 07:00.004
You wanna know what she is, Crowley?
How about God's sister?

07:01.171 --> 07:03.674
God's sister? He has relatives?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.683
I had that kind of leverage
under my thumb and I let it slip away.

07:09.846 --> 07:14.101
Can we focus on the big picture here,
okay? Can Sam meet with Lucifer, or not?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.435
In the Cage.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.400
No. Not in the Cage.
That's not gonna happen.

07:18.855 --> 07:23.031
Okay, then I don't meet with Lucifer.
Dean, we can't let him out.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.203
What?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.283
There may be a way.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.859
Clearly, if Sam enters the Cage,
he's gone.

08:00.605 --> 08:04.985
I mean, yes, it's on my bucket list but
now's not the time to be selfish.

08:05.735 --> 08:10.241
We need a secure site.
A way to neutralize Lucifer's powers.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.409
In Hell?

08:12.575 --> 08:14.043
Yes, in Hell.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.921
So we have a modicum of control.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.958
You think I want that abomination running
amok upstairs?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.844
Is it possible to control the situation?

08:23.003 --> 08:25.051
Because if Sam's not safe,
it's not happening.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.761
Goodness, mommy, loosen the grip.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.637
Theoretically, it's possible.

08:32.095 --> 08:35.440
There are challenges.
I can arrange your transit into Hell.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.773
Opening the Cage is another matter.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.227
You're the king of the joint.
Don't you have a key?

08:41.312 --> 08:44.907
It was sealed by God, himself!
Of course, I don't "have a key!"

08:48.361 --> 08:51.080
The mechanism is of divine manufacture.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.535
I believe its secrets, along with spells
forwarding Sam,

08:55.535 --> 08:58.288
are recorded
where many such mysteries are found.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.175
The Book of the Damned.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.656
Wonderful.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.283
Good to see you again. Yeah.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.154
Oh, hello, Mary. How are you?

09:31.863 --> 09:34.332
- Better. Thank you.
- Good.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.828
Agnes. Always a pleasure.
Good to see you.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.838
Hello.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.467
Are you in charge here?
I'm looking for God.

09:44.626 --> 09:48.005
Oh. Of course.
We all look for God. In all things.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.299
No, I need an actual meeting. In a room.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.847
Well, it's the right place.
This is His house.

09:57.055 --> 10:00.275
And the way to reach Him
is through prayer.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.069
- Like them, you mean?
- Mmm.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.903
Go ahead. Take her out for a spin.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.994
It's not working.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.879
Of course, it's working. He heard you.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.127
How do you know?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.757
Because He promised.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.759
Oh, so you have seen Him, then.

10:26.918 --> 10:30.513
Well, no one has. At least no one alive.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.264
Wait, so only dead people get to see Him?

10:37.220 --> 10:40.394
And this makes sense?
To billions of you?

10:41.224 --> 10:44.398
It is the nature of faith. It's all here.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.571
The mercy of God.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.488
His love of the world and mankind.
His, His perfect plan for us.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.201
Manipulation.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.992
You only believe
what He wants you to believe.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.746
- Exactly.
- But you don't know what He's like at all.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.412
We certainly do.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.501
God is the Light.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.967
And it is the Light
that vanquishes the Darkness.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.940
Mother. Good of you to stop by.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.989
Unhand me, you goons!

11:36.946 --> 11:40.450
So Fergus, think you've won?

11:41.618 --> 11:46.089
Lay a hand on me, and my followers will
swoop down on this tin can palace of yours

11:46.247 --> 11:48.090
with all the power
of the Book of the Damned.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.251
Stow it, you lying bitch.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.140
If you could do that,
you would've done it.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.389
If I wanted to kill you,
I'd have done that.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.594
Not that you haven't tried.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.230
You tried to kill me twice.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.101
What is it they say?
Third time's the charm.

12:11.397 --> 12:16.619
You're not handing me over to them?
It's beneath even you.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.030
They're your enemies as well.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.871
All right, Rowena, we get it.
We're all enemies. Okay?

12:22.033 --> 12:25.378
But right now, we got bigger fish to fry.
Then we can go back to killing each other.

12:26.329 --> 12:29.924
Ah. The chickens come home to roost.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.675
This ghastly force set free
when the Mark was removed.

12:35.797 --> 12:36.923
So you know.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.010
I've heard whispers. As bad as they say?

12:41.219 --> 12:44.018
Well let's just say that everyone in this
room might hold a piece of the puzzle

12:44.180 --> 12:46.103
to corking it back up.

12:46.307 --> 12:51.313
Oh, really. And what happens to me
once the danger's past?

12:51.604 --> 12:54.198
How do I know I can trust any of you?

12:55.817 --> 13:00.414
You don't. None of us do.
It's a devil's bargain.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.375
This is the time
for all angels to pull together.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.833
To put aside our disagreements
and show the big bosses

13:08.037 --> 13:10.836
how to save heaven from being taken over.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.469
'Cause it's grunts like us who'll get
kicked aside.

13:16.212 --> 13:21.218
Believe me, the Darkness has a plan for
every one of God's creations.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.392
Take over heaven?
How's that even possible?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.852
Yeah, who made her God?

13:27.348 --> 13:30.022
Come on, Daniel.
You know the stories as well as I do.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.112
All powerful, all consuming...

13:33.354 --> 13:35.527
Her beef is with God, not us.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.073
He locked her away.
It's on Him to make this right.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.751
Yeah. And you tell him that.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.166
Next time you see him.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.456
Oh. Oops.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.207
He's not around.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.259
Yeah. He locked her up.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.681
And you don't think
she's gonna wanna get even

14:01.716 --> 14:03.969
by tearing apart anything He ever made?

14:04.135 --> 14:06.763
You're gonna lead us against her?
You've never led anyone.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.940
None of us have. How is that a bad thing?

14:10.266 --> 14:13.987
When our leaders do nothing but pit the
factions against each other.

14:15.605 --> 14:19.826
This is in our laps, guys.
So spread the word.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.408
We get past our differences...

14:23.613 --> 14:25.786
We stand united.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.706
And we move... Now!

14:30.495 --> 14:35.376
Can this be true? His sister?

14:36.626 --> 14:39.630
In my day, we'd all be burnt at the stake
for even thinking any of this.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.716
You see then, Mother,
the need for urgency.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.145
Well, if my deciphering of the Book
is so pivotal,

14:47.387 --> 14:48.980
I'd like to know what's in it for me.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.357
You mean, other than your life?

14:51.599 --> 14:55.149
Speaking of which...
I'll make you a little deal, Mummy.

14:55.395 --> 15:00.117
You pitch in like a good girl,
I'll call off my assassins.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.032
No more looking over your shoulder.
For now.

15:04.862 --> 15:09.663
I'll need the Codex, of course,
and the code-breaker Charlie devised.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.461
Yeah, you'll get limited access.
Supervised.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.874
We need to know exactly this.
How to open the Cage,

15:16.082 --> 15:18.505
and how to protect Sam, once it is.

15:18.709 --> 15:22.054
Just what's in this cage
that's so dangerous?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.344
Lucifer.

15:29.137 --> 15:34.189
Lucifer. The original Dark Prince?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.107
Yes. An archangel so bad ass

15:36.269 --> 15:39.022
that he was personally dumped
into the Cage by God himself.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.275
Mmm.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.372
Let's get to it then, lads.

16:37.663 --> 16:44.091
Do you see what's happening?
All your favorites. All your chosen.

16:45.004 --> 16:50.431
They are suffering! Show yourself!

16:59.602 --> 17:03.277
Hey, Sammy.
Sorry to stick you with witch duty.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.949
As fun as that sounds.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.077
Every bit. But the stuff we're looking for
is definitely in the Book.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.453
Hey, hey, hey!
No snooping around there. Focus.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.127
You find anything at the church?

17:18.287 --> 17:19.334
No, I just got here.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.876
The cops say that the, last time the vics
were seen alive, one of them, a priest,

17:23.209 --> 17:26.213
they were talking to some mystery woman.
She was not killed.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.718
- Amara?
- Yeah, I bet.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.805
Apparently, it's a massacre.
The place is covered with blood.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.265
She's upping her game.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.547
She's gonna pass the point
where we can deal with her.

17:35.805 --> 17:40.436
Listen... Are you sure that you're...
You're okay with this whole deal?

17:43.312 --> 17:47.317
No. Not even a little.
But what choice do we have, you know?

17:47.525 --> 17:49.152
Okay. Well, for the record, I hate it.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.789
Just, wait for me.
Don't do anything until I get there.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.623
Right now, it's just research,
but you got it. Nothing without you.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.420
All right.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.873
Talk about trust.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.042
No, I don't.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.046
You and your bloodthirsty brother
say we're partners in this holy war

18:08.212 --> 18:13.685
against Amara. And yet...
Trussed like a chicken.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.306
You're sitting there,
with The Book of the Damned,

18:18.472 --> 18:21.646
and the means to read every word.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.398
And you think I'm gonna set you free?

18:23.978 --> 18:25.230
Do I look crazy?

18:25.980 --> 18:30.360
Well, you do have unresolved issues with
your domineering older brother

18:30.568 --> 18:32.195
and the abandonment by your father...

18:32.361 --> 18:34.241
You know what?
Just get back to work, all right?

18:36.907 --> 18:39.205
We're running out of time here.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.047
A-ha!

18:48.294 --> 18:49.841
What? What now?

18:50.379 --> 18:54.555
Well, I'll need some ingredients,
but you may summon Fergus.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.560
And tell him to bring a handcart.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.138
A handcart?

18:59.597 --> 19:01.520
We are going to Hell.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.771
Hot dog?

19:49.605 --> 19:52.154
Yeah. One.

20:20.094 --> 20:23.314
Sam, everything is in order.
Fergus is coming.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.524
I promised Dean I'd call.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.650
I promised Lincoln a fun night
at the theater. Things change.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.485
It's now or never.

20:37.778 --> 20:41.282
You felt my presence.
That's why you came here.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.310
You grew up.

21:05.681 --> 21:06.728
Yes.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.771
So, this is you now?

21:12.563 --> 21:14.361
At least for today.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.876
Flop sweat, Sonny?
Dread of what's to come?

21:29.079 --> 21:32.458
Can it.
Your barbs may amuse your circle of hags.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.428
You have no idea
what you're tampering with.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.261
What Lucifer is capable of.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.887
Well, dear, if you can't stand the heat,
get out of Hell.

21:43.594 --> 21:46.438
I must say,
it's not as scenic as I'd expected.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.392
We're in the furthest
reaches of Hell. Limbo.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.027
Where I send unruly souls for time-outs.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.948
This is where I meet with Lucifer?

21:56.148 --> 21:59.573
What it lacks in ambiance,
it makes up for in security.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.543
Makes your flesh crawl,
doesn't it, Moose?

22:15.751 --> 22:21.178
I get it. I'm the king of this place.
Still not my cup of tea.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.050
Hmm.

22:24.301 --> 22:29.774
I don't know, Crowley.
I'd say it suits you. Dark. Empty.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.895
Fascinating. The utter contempt.

22:35.312 --> 22:39.658
When I'm in the midst
of saving the Winchesters' bacon. Again.

22:39.859 --> 22:43.864
The point of this is to save
everyone's bacon. Including yours.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.333
Let's just hope
she knows what she's doing.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.571
That cell won't hold crap
if the warding's not right.

22:49.994 --> 22:53.294
Don't you worry about me, Samuel.
I am a professional.

22:56.375 --> 23:00.221
You're certain you can do this without
actually opening the Cage?

23:01.130 --> 23:03.633
We're about to find out, aren't we?

23:25.279 --> 23:28.408
Now. Let's have a go at that Cage.

23:44.465 --> 23:45.808
It begins.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.809
You misunderstand my purpose on Earth.

23:55.893 --> 24:00.194
Well, do I misunderstand the people you
butchered in that park? Or in that church?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.034
I had to get His attention.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.368
"His?"

24:05.611 --> 24:06.703
God.

24:07.655 --> 24:11.455
I tried praying. Calling out in need.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.878
He ignored me.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.211
He forced my hand.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.137
I had no other reason to harm His chosen.

24:24.338 --> 24:29.310
My issue is with my brother,
not His creation.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.985
Whatever the deal is between you two,
whoever threw the first punch,

24:38.185 --> 24:39.425
whoever was Daddy's favorite...

24:39.561 --> 24:41.188
There was no daddy.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.736
Whatever.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.449
That mess is your mess.
It's between you two.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.740
You're taking people's lives.
You're taking their souls.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.080
I consumed their souls.

24:54.576 --> 24:56.078
They aren't gone.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.714
They're a part of me.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.504
And in that way, they live forever.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.519
My old friend, Crowley.

25:59.975 --> 26:03.400
A mere acolyte, carrying your torch.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.117
You're too kind.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.745
To yourself.

26:16.492 --> 26:17.493
What do you want of me?

26:29.338 --> 26:33.764
Sam Winchester. My old roomie.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.515
Hug it out?

26:50.692 --> 26:54.196
I gotta say, I'm a little in the dark
about this meeting.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.626
Am I up for parole?

27:00.828 --> 27:06.050
Time off for bad behavior?
I don't really get visitors.

27:07.876 --> 27:11.722
If it weren't for the crisis topside,
you wouldn't be getting one now.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.639
Crisis?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.180
He's so alpha, isn't he?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.439
Probably not
relationship material, though.

27:20.639 --> 27:24.314
Mother, you're drooling.
Get a hold of yourself.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.033
You're aware of the Darkness?

27:33.861 --> 27:36.239
Yikes. That doesn't sound good.

27:36.405 --> 27:41.377
Um, I'm aware of what she was
but that was eons ago.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.919
She's been released.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.546
So now she's somewhere...

27:48.876 --> 27:50.878
Or everywhere on Earth.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.557
However did that happen?

27:59.261 --> 28:05.268
The point is, she poses a threat to
all that exists, including you.

28:05.475 --> 28:06.476
Mmm.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.324
Well, that leads me to my next question.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.911
Where is the Big Burrito himself?

28:16.653 --> 28:20.453
Where is God in all of this?

28:22.284 --> 28:25.288
All current indications of His presence

28:25.787 --> 28:30.133
are that there are
no current indications of his presence.

28:30.959 --> 28:34.805
What? Caught the Fun Bus out of town?

28:36.298 --> 28:37.299
Figures.

28:39.718 --> 28:43.598
But recently He has reached out

28:44.139 --> 28:46.983
to an interested party.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.482
Who?

28:50.479 --> 28:51.480
Me.

28:52.606 --> 28:53.698
You?

28:55.817 --> 28:57.740
He answered my prayers.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.995
Did He now?

29:02.908 --> 29:05.957
And what was Dad's suggestion?

29:09.456 --> 29:11.379
To seek out you.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.671
Get out of town. Seriously?

29:20.717 --> 29:22.344
Who would've thunk it?

29:22.594 --> 29:28.351
I see the wariness in your eyes.
The mistrust. I don't blame you.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.646
Don't you?

29:32.145 --> 29:33.738
It's incredible.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.194
How it endures the propaganda.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.865
He was so threatened by me.

29:43.073 --> 29:46.623
Fearful that I would make a more perfect
creation than He.

29:47.869 --> 29:51.874
So He exiled me. Virtually erased me.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.836
Passed down stories that I was a threat.

29:56.086 --> 29:59.340
While your brother was going all Kanye,
blowing His horn?

30:00.382 --> 30:03.602
He encouraged religions
as monuments to His ego.

30:04.344 --> 30:08.565
Promised the fearful safety
if they'd adore Him.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.898
His way or the highway.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.572
Some people find comfort in that.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.474
Golden Rule, brother's keeper.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.159
It is His universe. His rules.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.833
What if there were no rules?

30:28.201 --> 30:31.000
No pain? No prayer.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.921
Just... Bliss.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.258
That feeling that you have
when you're with me.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.470
For everyone. Forever.

30:50.474 --> 30:51.896
Can you hear what they're saying?

30:52.059 --> 30:54.403
I could if you'd just shut it.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.112
I completely get why you came to me.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.912
Can't ignore God, right?

31:04.446 --> 31:06.790
God says jump, everybody says, "How high?"

31:07.032 --> 31:08.392
So does this mean you're on board?

31:12.537 --> 31:17.134
Well, I did help Dad seal up the
Darkness all those years ago.

31:18.418 --> 31:22.798
She's quite a force. Determined to take
over everything, even back then.

31:23.215 --> 31:27.971
Prone to tantrums.
I can see why Pop is laying low.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.975
Lot of blabber going on.

31:33.266 --> 31:35.386
Surely Sam knows better
than to cut some sort of deal.

31:36.144 --> 31:39.569
You know, Fergus, sometimes striking
a deal, even a painful one,

31:39.773 --> 31:41.650
may be the only option.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.536
Like the hit you took out on me,
for instance?

31:44.778 --> 31:46.746
It's not easy being a parent.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.741
Knowing when to hug your child,
when to kill him.

31:50.325 --> 31:54.671
Now that Sis is here,
God's not the only circus in town.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.338
Is she equal to Him in power?

31:58.583 --> 32:01.006
Raw power, sure.

32:01.253 --> 32:06.009
But she's got none of the experience.

32:06.508 --> 32:09.182
God is a master strategist.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.895
It's why you're here.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.021
And why's that?

32:16.268 --> 32:19.738
Well 'cause God needs me to help put the
cat back in the bag.

32:20.730 --> 32:24.530
He can't do it by himself.
Seen that movie.

32:25.694 --> 32:26.741
And?

32:28.697 --> 32:30.916
And I need a ride out of here.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.237
I mean, I look swell in here

32:33.368 --> 32:35.370
and everything but I'd be
so much smoke topside.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.881
You want a vessel.

32:45.338 --> 32:49.559
One who's strong enough to hold me.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.479
Handy.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.306
And available now.

32:57.726 --> 32:58.727
Catch my drift?

33:02.063 --> 33:04.157
What is it exactly that you want?

33:04.357 --> 33:07.577
When you make the world of
"bliss" and "peace," what's in it for you?

33:07.777 --> 33:09.324
What I deserve.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.202
Which is?

33:12.199 --> 33:13.621
Everything.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.585
Everything?

33:15.744 --> 33:20.090
I was the beginning,
and I will be the end.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.421
I will be all that there is.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.592
So you're... You're it?

33:28.965 --> 33:30.683
That would make you God.

33:30.842 --> 33:34.597
No.  God was the Light.

33:35.889 --> 33:36.890
I am the Dark.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.157
Then what?

33:46.942 --> 33:49.661
That's all you need to know for now.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.047
You had to know that was pointless.

34:10.130 --> 34:13.510
I know that you're a warrior,
and your instinct is to resist.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.813
But... I can't be resisted.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.630
Did you really expect me to agree to this?

34:53.675 --> 34:55.848
So what, I just disappear
while you take my body

34:56.011 --> 34:58.639
and get set loose on the world again?

35:00.849 --> 35:03.568
I know. I know, Sam, it's a lotto ask.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.029
But desperate times
require desperate measures.

35:06.229 --> 35:09.028
That's not desperate, that's certifiable!

35:09.357 --> 35:11.951
Okay, hold on there a second, cowboy.
Take a breath.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.531
You have been working with Crowley.

35:18.199 --> 35:21.373
You passed "certifiable"
three off-ramps ago.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.375
And look, I'm no fan of
the Ruler of the Universe, but here I am,

35:26.374 --> 35:28.047
ready to pitch in.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.138
Sam, why do you think God sent you to me?

35:34.049 --> 35:35.050
To get my help.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.720
Which I only now just offered.

35:39.512 --> 35:43.983
Sam, your visions were the Word of God.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.894
You can't say no to that.

35:55.362 --> 35:56.864
What was that?

35:58.031 --> 35:59.408
The future.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.747
The inevitable result
of our first meeting.

36:02.160 --> 36:07.132
Of what you've been feeling
since that moment. What we both felt.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.584
That we're bonded.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.137
You're the one who set me free.

36:14.464 --> 36:15.681
No, that was an accident.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.218
It was destiny.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.563
You bore the Mark.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.065
I am the original Mark.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.944
You and I will be together.

36:30.230 --> 36:33.074
No. No, that's not gonna happen.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.486
It's so simple, Dean.

36:36.778 --> 36:37.779
We will become one.

36:39.489 --> 36:40.569
Why wouldn't you want that?

36:44.452 --> 36:45.499
Amara!

36:47.330 --> 36:50.459
You're going to surrender to us and
to the judgment of heaven.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.879
Why ever would I submit
to anything of God's creation?

36:54.921 --> 36:57.390
Tell your master to come fetch me Himself.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.971
All of heaven's on high alert.

36:59.384 --> 37:00.385
If you resist,

37:00.635 --> 37:04.685
each and every angel in the skies
will smite you in a single unified blow.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.148
Not even you could survive it.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.768
Whoa, whoa, whoa, fellas,
dial it down a bit, okay?

37:08.935 --> 37:11.535
Look, if you take her down,
a whole bunch of people are gonna die.

37:11.813 --> 37:14.157
We're at the point
where sacrifice is inevitable.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.905
Amara, no!

37:50.101 --> 37:51.853
What have you done?

37:59.611 --> 38:02.865
It's coming. They will smite you.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.209
Maybe now He'll hear me.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.057
So have you thought about it, Sam?

39:03.591 --> 39:05.764
Do I have an invitation
to look forward to?

39:16.145 --> 39:17.237
No.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.404
I won't do it.

39:26.281 --> 39:27.658
There has to be another way.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.802
What the hell's going on?

39:45.508 --> 39:49.479
Why did the warding fail?
What's happening?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.973
Follow me, Fergus.

40:02.358 --> 40:04.656
Together again.

40:04.861 --> 40:08.115
Hey, Sam Winchester, you miss me?

40:09.282 --> 40:10.283
Bet you did.

40:23.296 --> 40:24.388
I have to say.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.175
You're, you're extraordinarily calm
given the circumstances.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.229
It's pretty much exactly how God told me
it was gonna be.

40:34.891 --> 40:37.440
I guess I just have to go with it,
play my hand.

40:39.854 --> 40:45.202
That would make so much sense,
if it was God that was doing the talking.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.117
You see, Sam, when the Darkness descended,

40:49.948 --> 40:54.249
the impact on Hell was massive.
The Cage was damaged.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.713
Through the fissures
I was able to reach out.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.794
That wasn't God inside your head, Sam.

41:05.546 --> 41:11.804
It was me. So you see, He's not with you.

41:14.222 --> 41:20.275
He's never been with you.
It was always just me.

41:24.273 --> 41:27.527
So I guess I am your only hope.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.080
It's never gonna happen.

41:36.411 --> 41:40.006
Ah, well, settle in there, buddy.

41:42.083 --> 41:47.214
Hey, roomie, upper bunk, lower bunk?

41:49.090 --> 41:50.637
Or do you wanna share?

42:28.337 --> 42:29.338
