00:01.335 --> 00:03.936
<i> Previously on Van Helsing.</i>

00:03.938 --> 00:05.104
This is the house I grew up in.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.939
<i> Met some resistance folks</i>
<i> a month back.</i>

00:06.941 --> 00:09.441
<i> They said Denver</i>
<i> is the place to go.</i>

00:09.443 --> 00:10.676
The camp that sheema
is being held at

00:10.678 --> 00:11.844
is on the way to Denver.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.612
Dylan might be there.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.947
Allow me to purge
the human resistance,

00:14.949 --> 00:16.615
once and for all!

00:16.617 --> 00:18.217
You will do nothing whatsoever.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.618
But what about the woman?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.553
That is already being
dealt with.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.288
Susan was weak.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.957
You know that is danger.

00:24.959 --> 00:25.891
Tell her!

00:25.893 --> 00:27.626
Tell her the truth!

00:27.628 --> 00:28.894
We're not killers.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.295
Karma will take care
of the rest.

00:30.297 --> 00:33.932
( Screaming )
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!

00:44.011 --> 00:48.847
<i> ( Yelling in the distance )</i>
<i> Aaaah!!!!!!</i>

00:53.954 --> 00:57.322
Aaargh!!!

00:57.324 --> 00:58.757
God dammit.

00:58.759 --> 01:02.127
You okay? We gotta move.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.897
We both know what he can do
as a human.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.632
As a vampire, I don't want
to find out.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.134
Come on.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.235
No choice now.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.403
We're gonna have
to stand and fight.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.738
No, we run.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.839
We've bought ourselves
enough time.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.741
Shit!

01:15.743 --> 01:17.009
<i> Hey!</i>

01:17.011 --> 01:21.246
Hey!! Mohamad!

01:21.248 --> 01:22.581
Sam, you're gonna have
to let this go!

01:22.583 --> 01:25.517
Come over here so I can
finish this once and for all!

01:26.053 --> 01:28.454
( Gun shot )

01:33.060 --> 01:35.828
What's he waiting for?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.429
I guess I was right.

01:37.431 --> 01:41.767
Human or vampire, Sam
is still afraid of water.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.769
Okay, come on. Come on.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.839
I'll find you!

01:46.841 --> 01:49.074
I'll kill you!

01:50.911 --> 01:54.713
<i> ( Laughing )</i>

01:54.715 --> 01:59.384
<i> I can hear you!</i>

02:01.255 --> 02:04.690
( Out of breath )

02:04.692 --> 02:06.091
I think we lost him back there.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.026
He won't give up that easy.

02:08.028 --> 02:10.129
Without blood he won't
last too long.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.131
Yeah, but Sam is smart
and tough.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.799
He'll find a way to feed.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.534
Hey, let me look at that cut.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.702
What?

02:16.704 --> 02:18.704
Oh, shit.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.305
Adrenaline was pumping
back there.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.307
I didn't even notice.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.175
You know what?

02:23.177 --> 02:24.143
It's not deep enough
to need stitches

02:24.145 --> 02:25.477
but we need to bandage it.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.712
Man, hell.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.781
I've had worse.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.050
It's not that I'm worried about.

02:32.052 --> 02:35.254
Shit! It's like leaving him
a forwarding address!

02:36.690 --> 02:38.157
Dammit.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.558
There.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.960
It's gonna be nightfall soon
and we need a plan.

02:41.962 --> 02:45.898
Well, I know a place a few
miles down that way.

02:45.900 --> 02:46.565
Well, we gotta keep moving.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.066
Great.

02:48.068 --> 02:48.467
Ok.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.102
Thanks.

02:51.539 --> 03:01.446
( Rapid breathing )

03:17.198 --> 03:21.600
( Growling )

03:21.602 --> 03:22.034
( Animal squealing )

03:29.977 --> 03:31.343
( Animal squealing )

03:31.345 --> 03:33.045
( Snaps neck )

03:43.090 --> 03:50.062
( Eating sounds )

03:54.401 --> 03:56.868
Back at the river how'd you know
he'd be afraid?

03:56.870 --> 03:59.871
He told me he almost drowned
as a kid.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.506
Hated water ever since.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.383
Looks empty.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.085
Empty is good.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.630
You been here before?

04:24.632 --> 04:28.734
Yeah, hiked up here one summer.

04:28.736 --> 04:32.537
Got my forest ranger
merit badge.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.072
Boy scouts.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.707
Hell yeah!

04:35.709 --> 04:38.577
Why, is that so hard
to believe?

04:38.579 --> 04:41.146
You just don't really fit
the profile.

04:41.148 --> 04:44.416
What, middle class white boy
from the suburbs?

04:44.418 --> 04:47.819
You do know black people got
hobbies too, right?

04:47.821 --> 04:48.820
No, I know.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.489
You just... you don't strike me
as someone

04:50.491 --> 04:52.891
who liked following orders
is all.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.928
You know, someone
who likes structure.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.498
Yeah, I was different back then.

04:59.500 --> 05:04.036
Before... you know,
before all this.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.575
We'll be safe to sleep
here tonight.

05:10.577 --> 05:14.012
I didn't tell Sam
about this place.

05:14.014 --> 05:17.082
And tomorrow?

05:17.084 --> 05:20.018
What're we gonna do?

05:20.020 --> 05:21.153
We're here.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.155
The back end of rampart Ridge.

05:23.157 --> 05:28.260
Now, there is a trail head
a few miles north east.

05:28.262 --> 05:31.363
If we follow
the Tacoma pass,

05:31.365 --> 05:35.267
cut through this
old horse ranch,

05:35.269 --> 05:39.271
we should get
to the camp by nightfall.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.272
Then what?

05:40.274 --> 05:41.173
I don't know.

05:41.175 --> 05:44.776
I'm making all this up
as I go.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.012
Look, I didn't tell you this
when we were eating

05:47.014 --> 05:49.614
because of all the crazy shit
happening,

05:49.616 --> 05:52.184
but I'm really glad
we're back together.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.119
Me too.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.387
How'd you track us down,
anyway?

05:55.389 --> 05:59.057
Was it blind luck, or... what?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.960
Well, I was following you
and then I heard the bells

06:01.962 --> 06:04.596
and then later got sick.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.631
Emma's the one
that got me there

06:06.633 --> 06:09.501
but Sam's the one
that found me.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.383
You feel guilty?

06:24.385 --> 06:26.885
About Sam?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.253
Well, he was my friend.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.827
A friend who killed a lot
of other friends.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.497
You think I don't know that?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.132
Look, whatever he was,
whatever he became,

06:40.134 --> 06:43.668
he always looked out for me.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.237
I owe him my life.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.872
How come?

06:50.477 --> 06:53.345
It wasn't long after my sister
and I got free.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.847
We started rolling
with this crew.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.350
She and a couple others went
out in search for food

06:58.352 --> 06:59.584
and they got caught in
this old grocery store

06:59.586 --> 07:01.753
by Dmitri's guards.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.923
I tried to save them,
me and a couple guys,

07:04.925 --> 07:09.428
but the feeders were
already there, waiting.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.162
Nearly killed everyone.

07:10.164 --> 07:14.666
I almost bled out.

07:14.668 --> 07:19.671
Sam found me, barely alive.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.506
He took care of me.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.941
Fed me.

07:22.943 --> 07:28.780
Besides sheema, Sam was the
closest thing I had to family.

07:28.782 --> 07:34.786
And finding out he's the killer
and now one of them...

07:34.788 --> 07:39.624
Sam said something in the woods
right before we left him.

07:39.626 --> 07:44.429
He said "tell her the truth".

07:44.431 --> 07:46.798
What truth, mohamad?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.134
He was just begging
for his life.

07:49.136 --> 07:53.438
Trying to make us second guess
what we were about to do.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.873
( Sighs )

07:54.875 --> 07:56.508
And it worked.

08:00.180 --> 08:04.850
He conned everyone.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.452
Hey, there's no way you
could have known.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.870
Right?

08:08.871 --> 08:10.287
We give people the benefit
of the doubt and...

08:10.290 --> 08:13.291
Sometimes we get burned.

08:13.293 --> 08:19.698
Mohamad, I... I don't know how
we keep trusting.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.634
But I do know
that if we don't

08:22.636 --> 08:25.403
we're one step away
from being like them.

08:31.378 --> 08:34.546
You should shut that off.

08:34.548 --> 08:38.483
Any sign of light can be seen
from far out.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.453
Especially by them.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.797
( Low growling )

08:57.738 --> 08:59.170
The buildings are empty.

08:59.172 --> 09:02.774
The humans, all gone.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.343
She was here, in Eden,
with the others.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.679
How did they know
we were coming?

09:07.681 --> 09:10.248
They must have been warned.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.350
Warned?

09:12.352 --> 09:14.152
Warned?

09:14.154 --> 09:17.923
By whom?

09:17.925 --> 09:19.658
You?

09:19.660 --> 09:22.360
Never!

09:22.362 --> 09:24.930
This used to be your home.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.866
You let the humans here live.

09:27.868 --> 09:31.202
Maybe you're more loyal
to them than me.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.203
No!

09:32.205 --> 09:34.339
No, listen to me.

09:34.341 --> 09:38.443
One of our kind that the woman
turned back to human,

09:38.445 --> 09:40.378
I bit her.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.882
She didn't turn back!

09:43.884 --> 09:46.117
She was immune.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.854
I know things.

09:49.856 --> 09:53.792
And I would do anything
for you, Julius.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.094
Anything.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.131
Would you die for me?

10:00.133 --> 10:03.101
You know I would.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.907
( Gasps )

10:10.110 --> 10:12.377
Burn the buildings.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.245
Hunt them!

10:14.247 --> 10:16.448
Hunt them all!

10:23.857 --> 10:25.924
Where are we going now?

10:28.028 --> 10:31.763
As far away from Eden
as we can.

10:54.521 --> 10:59.190
Not exactly a beretta
hollow point, but it'll do.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.992
Hey, we gotta book it if we're
gonna get to this camp

11:00.994 --> 11:05.597
before dark.

11:05.599 --> 11:09.267
Hey, you ok?

11:09.269 --> 11:12.504
How long has it been since
you escaped that camp?

11:12.506 --> 11:15.106
I'm not sure,
about a month or two?

11:15.108 --> 11:16.941
How do you know
she's still there?

11:16.943 --> 11:18.009
Sheema?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.144
Yeah.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.278
Um... because.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.048
Wait, why?

11:23.050 --> 11:25.450
( Sighs )

11:25.452 --> 11:28.453
I feel like I'm searching
for Dylan

11:28.455 --> 11:29.954
without really having
a plan at all.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.390
And I'm telling you there
are buildings in this camp

11:32.392 --> 11:33.425
where they keep the kids-

11:33.426 --> 11:34.459
look, my gut, ok?

11:34.461 --> 11:37.629
My gut is saying
she's not there.

11:37.631 --> 11:38.730
I'm sorry.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.899
I- I'm missing something

11:40.901 --> 11:42.267
and I can't figure out
what it is.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.634
You can't be doing this shit
to me again, Vanessa.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.570
I thought we were working
together on this.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.973
We still can.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.810
Ok, well I'm not traveling
thousands of miles to Denver

11:51.812 --> 11:56.548
when my sister is literally
half a day away.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.217
Mohamad, she might be, ok?

11:59.219 --> 11:59.951
She might not.

11:59.953 --> 12:03.288
It's better than nothing.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.056
( Sighs )

12:05.058 --> 12:08.393
Ok, look.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.962
We practically have to go
through the camp

12:10.964 --> 12:12.997
to get to Denver anyway.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.400
What do you have to lose
just checking it out?

12:15.402 --> 12:18.570
Well, they could catch me again.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.473
And I might not escape.

12:21.475 --> 12:23.742
What then, huh?

12:23.744 --> 12:28.246
How am I gonna get Dylan then?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.482
And here I was thinking
we're just starting

12:30.484 --> 12:34.352
to become a family.

12:34.354 --> 12:38.323
All this talk of trust.

12:38.325 --> 12:42.827
Well, if you can't give any you
sure as hell don't deserve it.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.434
I understand.

12:49.436 --> 12:53.271
No, get out.

12:53.273 --> 12:53.772
Wait for me.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.673
Outside.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.616
What are they doing here?

13:04.618 --> 13:07.352
I have been summoned.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.287
Why?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.456
Dmitri blames me.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.525
The woman.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.426
Quickly, kill the messenger.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.361
We can still run!

13:16.363 --> 13:21.099
They will find us,
you know that.

13:21.101 --> 13:25.537
If you go to the citadel
you will die.

13:25.539 --> 13:30.475
If I refuse, we will all die.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.709
I will face him.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.212
I am not afraid.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.015
Fear is for humans.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.395
<i> ( Screaming outside )</i>

14:41.781 --> 14:44.249
( Growl )

14:50.257 --> 14:53.424
I just gotta reconnect the cup
links here.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.426
Yeah, there it is.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.428
That's got it.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.963
Must have fused.

15:08.675 --> 15:09.374
It's fine.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.075
Don't thank me all at once.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.246
We're going. Let's go.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.687
We good?

15:22.689 --> 15:23.721
Yeah.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.123
When the time comes someone's
gonna have to get

15:25.125 --> 15:28.459
within 300 yards for the remote
trigger to work.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.696
Why do we need to take out
the electricity?

15:31.698 --> 15:32.697
It's the citadel doors.

15:32.699 --> 15:33.564
Magnetic locks.

15:33.566 --> 15:38.469
Without power, open sesame.

15:38.471 --> 15:42.073
We'll have our people in
before they know what hit them.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.743
So we're really going for this?

15:45.745 --> 15:47.378
Taking on all of them?

15:47.380 --> 15:48.146
Not alone.

15:48.148 --> 15:48.780
We'll have help.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.648
From who?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.550
The people on the outside?

15:52.552 --> 15:55.153
The resistance?

15:55.155 --> 15:58.156
You just be ready when
the time is right.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.758
You'll know what you need
to know.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.236
It's not that far from here.

16:12.238 --> 16:13.004
You ok?

16:13.006 --> 16:16.341
Holy shit.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.343
Nah.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.410
I gotta- I really gotta
change this.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.579
You're still bleeding.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.747
Yeah, I'm not you.

16:22.749 --> 16:26.017
My wounds don't heal like magic.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.586
Ugh, I feel way older
than I should be.

16:28.588 --> 16:32.290
I am not a kid anymore,
that's for damn sure.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.862
So you said they keep the kids
at a separate part of the camp?

16:37.864 --> 16:39.097
Away from the others?

16:39.099 --> 16:40.498
Yeah.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.934
It's like the children are
special to them or something.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.369
You know, they don't make
them work hard,

16:44.371 --> 16:47.505
they don't feed on them
as much as I can tell.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.840
Maybe they got something else
in store for them.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.742
But the teenagers and adults,

16:50.744 --> 16:53.011
they're bled until they die.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.946
That's why I gotta get
sheema out.

16:54.948 --> 16:55.780
Maybe we gotta get
everyone out.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.115
No, no, no, no.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.684
Don't get all superhero on me,
ok?

16:59.686 --> 17:00.518
That's a fight for another day.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.352
We gotta stick to the plan.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.920
Sheema, Dylan.

17:02.922 --> 17:03.955
In, out.

17:03.957 --> 17:05.056
Done.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.126
( Thud )

17:08.128 --> 17:09.394
Sam.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.131
( Rattling )

17:20.273 --> 17:26.344
( Fighting grunts )

17:28.448 --> 17:30.581
Don't make me take you down,
Sam, you know I will!

17:32.252 --> 17:36.687
( Fighting grunts )

17:43.363 --> 17:44.629
Mohamad, run!

17:44.631 --> 17:46.164
You should have killed me.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.231
Run!

17:58.778 --> 17:59.744
( Groans )

18:01.281 --> 18:06.350
( Fighting grunts )

18:39.152 --> 18:45.556
Your blood smells like death.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.763
Easy now.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.765
Don't do it. Don't do it.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.833
Please, please.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.701
Must feed.

18:56.703 --> 18:57.869
Sam, please-

18:57.871 --> 18:59.604
feed or die.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.438
Sam, don't you do it!

19:00.440 --> 19:04.041
We can still be together.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.010
I could bite you.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.044
Turn you.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.446
No.

19:08.448 --> 19:08.946
No, I don't want that.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.682
I don't want that.

19:11.684 --> 19:11.983
( Hissing )

19:11.985 --> 19:13.117
No!!!

19:13.119 --> 19:14.585
( Gun shot )

19:19.659 --> 19:21.292
Did he bite you?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.627
Did he bite you?!

19:22.629 --> 19:23.294
No.

19:23.296 --> 19:23.861
No, I'm good.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.630
We have to finish him.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.931
Wha?

19:32.939 --> 19:34.238
Shit!

19:37.043 --> 19:39.243
You better hope he crawled away
and died.

19:39.245 --> 19:39.877
Woah, woah, woah.

19:39.879 --> 19:40.712
You shot him in the face,

19:40.713 --> 19:41.546
and blinded him.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.381
That doesn't make him dead.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.982
Well, he can't feed
on what he can't see.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.884
And if he can't feed
he can't heal.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.321
Only one outcome after that.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.157
You hesitated back there,
finishing him off.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.493
Why?

19:55.495 --> 19:56.494
It- it's complicated.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.328
Yeah.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.829
Tell that to Cynthia.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.766
And Roger, and Susan.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.335
If anything it would have been
justice.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.303
Back in the hospital,

20:05.305 --> 20:07.004
when Brendan locked us up
in those cells,

20:07.006 --> 20:08.773
he was gonna banish me.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.675
Sam confessed
but nobody listened.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.743
Everyone thought he was
just trying to protect me.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.079
It was a little more than that.

20:15.081 --> 20:18.349
Maybe if I paid more attention,

20:18.351 --> 20:20.017
or seen what was
right in front of me,

20:20.019 --> 20:23.688
maybe Susan would
still be alive.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.524
Maybe more.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.526
Sam would have killed you too,
eventually.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.193
You're guilty of nothing.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.395
Only him.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.899
Well, here it is.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.668
The outskirts of it,
anyways.

20:38.171 --> 20:39.870
There's gotta be a less
obvious way in.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.206
Yeah, there is.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.375
Half a mile in that direction.

20:44.377 --> 20:48.613
But... from here on out
shit gets real.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.248
You still up for that?

21:01.160 --> 21:03.628
What is this?

21:03.630 --> 21:05.630
( Snarling )

21:05.632 --> 21:14.805
Found him in the woods,
burned, blinded, dying.

21:14.807 --> 21:19.143
Not him, it.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.912
Recently turned.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.316
Almost feral.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.518
Take it out, kill it.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.496
Don't defy me!

21:38.498 --> 21:40.398
( Low growl )

21:40.400 --> 21:44.335
This one is different.

21:44.337 --> 21:51.075
Saw it as a human
at the hospital.

21:51.077 --> 21:54.111
With the woman.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.385
( Snarling )

22:10.930 --> 22:20.104
( Drinking blood )

22:20.106 --> 22:24.442
Taste the difference.

22:24.444 --> 22:28.612
Animal blood is crude.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.114
Toxic.

22:30.116 --> 22:35.686
But human blood, mmm.

22:35.688 --> 22:41.859
Yes, your blindness
is leaving you.

22:41.861 --> 22:46.530
If I hadn't given you a human
to feed on

22:46.532 --> 22:51.435
you would have become
a feral.

22:59.379 --> 23:03.280
Now I understand.

23:05.318 --> 23:08.285
I saved you.

23:14.060 --> 23:19.063
And now you can save me.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.147
Tell me about the woman.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.150
Vanessa?

23:39.152 --> 23:41.152
Yes.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.921
From the hospital.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.892
The special one.

23:47.894 --> 23:57.835
And all the ones she turned
and that one you called out for.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.939
Mohamad?

24:01.941 --> 24:06.777
I will tell you what
you want to know.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.513
About her.

24:09.515 --> 24:13.684
But not him, he's mine.

24:13.686 --> 24:20.858
One way or another,

24:20.860 --> 24:27.498
you will tell me everything.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.448
Alright.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.050
Everything's in place.

24:46.052 --> 24:48.786
Explosives are set,
weapons are ready,

24:48.788 --> 24:50.120
we just need to set a date.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.122
You sure they'll come through?

24:52.124 --> 24:53.207
There's too much at stake.

24:53.208 --> 24:54.291
They know it's now or never.

24:54.293 --> 24:57.228
If the resistance hangs us out
to dry Dmitri will kill us all.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.797
Slowly.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.132
Isn't he already?

25:02.134 --> 25:04.401
Trust me.

25:04.403 --> 25:05.936
I'm going out there
to make sure.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.708
Put those away.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.928
( Twig snaps )

26:06.098 --> 26:06.830
Theo?

26:13.439 --> 26:18.275
Theo? Emma?

26:18.277 --> 26:19.176
Theo?

26:19.178 --> 26:20.945
( Twig snaps )

26:27.019 --> 26:28.018
Woah!

26:28.020 --> 26:29.553
Woah!

26:29.555 --> 26:30.220
Woah, hey.

26:30.222 --> 26:30.671
Hey, hey, hey.

26:30.672 --> 26:31.121
I'm no threat.

26:31.123 --> 26:34.224
I'm no threat.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.859
I know you're not.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.999
Oh, my god! Brendan?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.721
( Groaning )

27:03.723 --> 27:07.558
Name.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.226
I need names.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.063
( Cries out in agony )

27:14.634 --> 27:17.401
There's no point in resisting.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.502
Tell me!

27:18.504 --> 27:19.637
( Twig snaps )

27:23.309 --> 27:24.058
Easy!

27:24.059 --> 27:24.808
Drop it.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.243
Now!

27:34.420 --> 27:35.586
You work for them?

27:35.588 --> 27:36.987
They're called the red brigade.

27:36.989 --> 27:40.157
They collect the blood,
drive the trucks.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.925
Inform on humans.

27:41.927 --> 27:44.061
The vampires give the
collaborators better treatment.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.230
They're collaborators.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.932
Traitors.

27:48.934 --> 27:51.101
Strip off the uniforms.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.970
Now.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.139
Wait, wait, wait.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.773
You really think
that's gonna work?

27:56.776 --> 27:58.475
There's only one way
to find out.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.215
The woman.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.618
She can turn us human.

28:07.620 --> 28:10.054
I've seen it.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.723
But there's more.

28:12.725 --> 28:19.963
Once human, we cannot
be turned again.

28:19.965 --> 28:23.300
You, maybe.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.502
But can she turn us?

28:25.504 --> 28:27.971
One who has lived for so long?

28:27.973 --> 28:30.240
( Speaking Romanian )

28:30.242 --> 28:31.475
You should know.

28:31.477 --> 28:35.312
You had her, and you
let her get away.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.814
I had no choice.

28:36.816 --> 28:43.987
You knew where she went,
but you failed to catch her.

28:43.989 --> 28:46.323
As did you.

28:46.325 --> 28:49.226
In the city.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.947
But if we had worked together-

28:52.948 --> 28:56.667
you had your chance but you
would not follow my orders.

28:56.669 --> 29:01.271
I created you, Julius.

29:01.273 --> 29:05.075
But ever since you have done
nothing but disappoint me.

29:09.115 --> 29:13.450
You cast me out.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.519
You gave me nothing.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.821
You are nothing.

29:19.925 --> 29:23.093
I was going to give you
my sister.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.429
But you do not deserve her.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.268
What will you do?

29:31.270 --> 29:33.370
Kill me?

29:33.372 --> 29:35.472
Replace me?

29:35.474 --> 29:38.809
( Chuckles )

29:38.811 --> 29:45.682
If you want power, Julius,
come and take it.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.859
( Groans )

29:59.064 --> 30:01.165
( Choking )

30:01.167 --> 30:02.332
I could end it.

30:02.334 --> 30:06.570
Here. Now.

30:06.572 --> 30:11.074
Then... do... it.

30:11.076 --> 30:16.847
( Gasping )

30:16.849 --> 30:18.749
( Chuckles )

30:18.751 --> 30:21.485
It is not yet your time.

30:24.857 --> 30:27.024
The elders still need us
to find the answers.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.660
To resurrect them.

30:29.662 --> 30:32.663
Restore them to their dominion,

30:32.665 --> 30:36.567
and allow them to live
for a thousand lifetimes.

30:36.569 --> 30:40.170
We cannot do this if we
are divided.

30:40.172 --> 30:44.174
The elders, they're all gone.

30:44.176 --> 30:47.277
Are they?

30:47.279 --> 30:52.649
Restore my faith in you
and I will show you the truth.

31:00.359 --> 31:04.027
We're seriously gonna
do this?

31:04.029 --> 31:07.364
What?

31:07.366 --> 31:09.700
What if something goes wrong?

31:09.702 --> 31:10.868
( Stutters ) What if-

31:10.870 --> 31:14.037
hey, we can't turn back now.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.541
We've come this far.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.711
There's stuff I wanted
to tell you.

31:20.713 --> 31:23.647
Things I did,
things I didn't do.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.215
I'm sorry-

31:25.217 --> 31:26.717
don't, don't, don't.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.452
Look at me.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.487
Regrets aren't gonna help us
right now, ok?

31:30.489 --> 31:32.956
We have to stay focused
on what's important.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.391
Dylan.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.792
Sheema.

31:35.794 --> 31:38.528
They might be in there and
they're counting on us.

31:38.530 --> 31:41.398
Right?

31:41.400 --> 31:44.134
Right.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.770
Let's finish this.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.695
Where is everyone?

32:44.697 --> 32:46.029
Night curfew.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.264
Prisoners are confined
in barracks

32:47.266 --> 32:49.533
unless they're on work detail
or...

32:49.535 --> 32:50.934
Getting fed on?

32:50.936 --> 32:53.337
Yeah.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.205
Alright, where do they keep
the children?

32:55.207 --> 32:57.107
On the far side.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.675
Ok.

32:58.677 --> 32:59.693
Hey, hey, hey.

32:59.694 --> 33:00.710
Sheema's on the other side.

33:00.713 --> 33:03.780
We gotta split up.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.048
Ok.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.617
Just stay out of the lights, ok?

33:07.619 --> 33:09.553
Be careful, and meet me back
here as soon as you can.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.788
Yeah.

33:11.790 --> 33:15.625
Good luck.

33:15.627 --> 33:18.795
Yeah, I don't think luck has
anything to do with it anymore.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.579
It's been hours.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.148
They'll come looking for me.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.682
They- they will find me.

34:12.684 --> 34:15.485
Has anyone ever told you
you talk too much?

34:25.831 --> 34:26.997
Brendan, the hospital,
that wasn't my plan.

34:26.999 --> 34:30.000
I didn't want any blood spilled.

34:30.002 --> 34:31.501
I... your friends-

34:31.503 --> 34:34.571
we're not having
this conversation.

34:34.573 --> 34:35.739
Look, I know what
it's like to have a cause.

34:35.740 --> 34:36.906
To have a purpose.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.241
The people that I'm-

34:38.243 --> 34:40.844
I'm traveling with,
they could help you.

34:40.846 --> 34:44.347
Uh, we- we could all
work together.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.950
Brendan, you don't have
to kill me.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.586
Who said anything
about killing you?

34:54.093 --> 34:56.526
I found him down river
from the dam.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.862
My name is taka.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.031
I need your help.

35:01.033 --> 35:03.100
Where is this friend of yours?

35:03.102 --> 35:05.102
Vanessa?

35:45.310 --> 35:47.644
Oh, god.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.229
<i> ( Faint female voice ):</i>
<i> Is someone there, help.</i>

35:49.230 --> 35:50.813

37:04.790 --> 37:10.627
( Sniffing )

37:10.629 --> 37:12.362
Who's there?

37:15.968 --> 37:20.136
Why don't you come here
and find out?

37:24.209 --> 37:27.077
It's been a long time since
i carved up a live one.

37:27.079 --> 37:27.978
( Growls )

37:27.980 --> 37:30.880
( Cries out )
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!

38:35.847 --> 38:38.848
Ahhhhh!!!!

38:40.519 --> 38:49.259
( Gurgling sounds )

39:00.739 --> 39:04.974
He let me live.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.178
To earn back my place
i must help him.

39:08.180 --> 39:11.414
What shall we do?

39:16.922 --> 39:19.522
No.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.359
No!!!

39:22.361 --> 39:24.327
No, no, no, no!

39:43.882 --> 39:48.017
( Cries out in anguish )

40:04.236 --> 40:05.602
( Startled cry )

40:05.603 --> 40:06.969
Shh, it's ok. It's ok.

40:06.972 --> 40:07.804
I'm human.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.305
What?

40:09.307 --> 40:11.074
How?

40:11.076 --> 40:12.542
I'm looking for someone.

40:12.544 --> 40:13.643
You shouldn't be here.

40:13.645 --> 40:14.878
They'll kill you.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.579
They'll kill all of us.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.748
I'm looking for my little girl.
Dylan.

40:18.750 --> 40:19.149
Have you seen her?

40:19.151 --> 40:21.084
No. No.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.052
Well, look at the picture.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.988
Please, she's 10 years old.

40:24.990 --> 40:28.391
Actually, she'd be 13 years old,
brown hair.

40:28.393 --> 40:29.459
You're wasting your time.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.094
I'm not. Please.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.728
They don't keep children here.

40:32.731 --> 40:35.165
Only the old and the sick.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.733
But this is a work camp.

40:36.735 --> 40:37.801
They bring everyone here.

40:37.803 --> 40:42.071
No, only the ones
they wanna bleed out.

40:42.073 --> 40:46.176
This is a blood farm.

40:46.178 --> 40:51.080
It's too late for all of us but
you can still save yourself.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.149
Go! Now!

40:53.151 --> 41:04.260
( Alarm sounding )

41:07.866 --> 41:09.332
Shit.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.836
Come on, mohamad.

41:17.442 --> 41:18.775
Shit.

41:19.344 --> 41:20.777
Mohamad?

41:20.779 --> 41:27.250
( Alarm continues to wail )

41:27.252 --> 41:28.117
Mohamad.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.353
Mohamad, come on!

41:30.355 --> 41:31.287
Come on, we gotta
get outta here.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.089
Come on!

41:43.802 --> 41:47.036
Excellent work, my son.

41:49.774 --> 41:53.977
Mohamad, wha- what the hell?

41:53.979 --> 42:00.383
I'm sorry, I had no choice.

42:00.385 --> 42:01.885
No choice?

42:06.057 --> 42:09.225
There's nothing you can do.

42:09.227 --> 42:12.529
Nowhere you can run.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.468
You will make a beautiful prize.

42:22.173 --> 42:23.406
( Grunt )
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!

42:39.724 --> 42:44.561
You look just like your mother.
