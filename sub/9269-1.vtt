00:15.000 --> 00:17.990
Hello?

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
FLOORBOARDS CREAK

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Hello?

00:33.000 --> 00:33.990
Hello?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Father?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.990
Thank God you're here.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.990
I came as quickly as I could.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.990
My condolences, Mrs McKinley.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.990
For...? Your message
said it was urgent.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.990
I assumed someone
was in need of last rites?

00:49.000 --> 00:51.990
It's too late for that, Father.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.990
What I need is an exorcism.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.990
I'm serious.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.990
This house...is haunted.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.990
The noises you could explain away,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.990
but then...things started moving.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.990
I'm sure there's
a rational explanation.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Elspeth.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Your sister?

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
She wants to tell us something.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
She's not resting easy.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.990
We don't know if she's dead...

01:31.000 --> 01:33.990
When she disappeared,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.990
they said she'd be back
in a few days.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.990
It's been nine years.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.990
That still doesn't mean she's dead.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.990
And it certainly doesn't
mean that she's haunting you.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.990
We just need this to stop.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.990
Please, Father, help us.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
We need an exorcism. Nonsense.

01:56.000 --> 01:56.990
I'll give your house a blessing.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.990
But there are no such
things as ghosts!

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
CHANDELIER CRASHES

02:34.000 --> 02:36.990
CHURCH BELL TOLLS

02:37.000 --> 02:39.990
That's really
the earliest you can do?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.990
I'm afraid so.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.990
Then tonight it is. Yes.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Darling?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Selina!

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Bye.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.990
Do you remember
Elspeth Grainger going missing?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.990
I most certainly do.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.990
I always thought if you hadn't
been off on the pilgrimage

03:06.000 --> 03:09.990
to Lourdes for the duration,
he'd never have got away with it.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.990
Who?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.990
Victor McKinley.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.990
Charlotte's husband?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.990
What was he accused of? Abduction?

03:19.000 --> 03:19.990
Murder.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.990
But they had to let him go.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.990
No body, no evidence.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.990
That does tend to put the kibosh
on an investigation.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.990
She just vanished
off the face of the earth.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.990
If ever a house were haunted,
Cudeley Manor would be it.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.990
Cobblers...

03:37.000 --> 03:37.990
to borrow from the vernacular.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.990
She didn't get that from me.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.990
Go offer the McKinleys
a lift, would you?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.990
Next time you want to gossip,
Mrs McCarthy, run it by me first.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.990
Elspeth eloped,

03:50.000 --> 03:51.990
to get away from that
domineering father of theirs.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Everybody knows that.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.990
God arises,
His enemies are scattered,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.990
and those who hate Him flee
before Him. (This is ridiculous.)

04:11.000 --> 04:13.990
ALL: As smoke is driven away,
so are they driven.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.990
As wax melts before the fire,
so the wicked perish before God.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.990
(It's not going to help.)

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
See the cross of the Lord.
Be gone, you hostile powers!

04:27.000 --> 04:28.990
And then there was light!

04:29.000 --> 04:30.990
It's a sign!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.990
It's the electrics.
They keep cutting in and out.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.990
Looks like mice ate the cable.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.990
It's fixed, for now.
What's all this?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.990
We're setting my sister's
spirit free.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.990
Mr Wake's doing our renovation work.
If you'd like to join us?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
This is sick.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.990
Invoice. Another one? Your estimate
said... That's for the overtime.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I still haven't been paid
for that last one yet.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
See to it.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.990
Shall we continue?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.990
From the snares of the devil...
ALL: Lord, deliver us.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.990
That you help your Church to serve
you in security and freedom...

05:07.000 --> 05:07.990
ALL: We beg you to hear us.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.990
That you humble the enemies
of the holy Church.
ALL: We beg you to hear us.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.990
HE SPEAKS IN LATIN

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
ALL: Amen.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.990
Is that it? It's done.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Finally(!) Can I go, then?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.990
Isn't there supposed to be
some kind of a sign?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.990
A clap of thunder, lightning,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.990
something that tells us
that she's actually gone?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.990
Believe me, if your sister is dead,
she rests in peace.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
There's nothing here now.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.990
Oh... Guess who? Er...

06:02.000 --> 06:03.990
Oh, you're going to
have to help me out.

06:04.000 --> 06:04.990
SHE GIGGLES

06:05.000 --> 06:07.990
It's me...Selina.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.990
Ah. Er...

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I know you've noticed me.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.990
You're a bit young for this,
aren't you?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.990
Old enough to marry.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.990
Old enough to elope.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
ELECTRICITY CRACKLES

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
CRASH, WOMAN SCREAMS

06:28.000 --> 06:29.990
It's not possible!

06:30.000 --> 06:31.990
It's Elspeth.
It's not possible!

06:32.000 --> 06:33.990
Please, breathe.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.990
Oh! It's only a painting.

06:37.000 --> 06:37.990
It flew at me.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.990
She's still here!

06:40.000 --> 06:41.990
Cord's still intact. It didn't work!

06:42.000 --> 06:43.990
I've got to get out.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.990
No, Victor, please! I have to go!

06:47.000 --> 06:48.990
Father, please, help us!

06:49.000 --> 06:52.990
I think we should revisit this
in the cold light of day.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.990
We can't be alone here overnight.
Not now.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.990
What about Mr McKinley?
Isn't he coming back?

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Father, you can't stay. You're
expected at the Bishop's for matins.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.990
Sid, can you stay?

07:07.000 --> 07:11.990
Er...no, no, I have to, erm,
return the car to Lady F.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.990
He's scared. I am not scared.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.990
Good. Mrs McCarthy and I
will take the car back,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
and we'll see you in the morning.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.990
Sure, I never knew you could drive.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
How hard can it be?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.990
ENGINE TURNS OVER

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
That Mr McKinley's a rum one.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.990
GEARS CREAK AND GRIND

07:40.000 --> 07:40.990
So?

07:41.000 --> 07:45.990
I heard he was struck off
and that's why they're back in town.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.990
Probably killed a patient.
Maybe that's who's haunting them.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.990
No-one's haunting them.
I'm not interested in gossip.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.990
I'm more interested in who's
trying to fake Elspeth's ghost.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.990
Well, why did you say the prayers
if you don't believe in ghosts?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.990
It's all in the mind.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.990
I thought that telling Charlotte
that the ghost was gone

08:05.000 --> 08:06.990
was what she needed to hear.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
And now?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
HE REVS LOUDLY

08:13.000 --> 08:14.990
HANDBRAKE CREAKS

08:15.000 --> 08:16.990
ENGINE STOPS

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Now we walk home.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
BOOK DROPS
Oh!

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
HE SNORES

08:52.000 --> 08:53.990
HE YELLS

08:54.000 --> 08:54.990
Do you want to wake up
the whole house?!

08:55.000 --> 08:56.990
I was about to say the same to you.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.990
Ohh, isn't it past your bedtime?

08:59.000 --> 08:59.990
You're from London, aren't you?

09:00.000 --> 09:00.990
Used to be.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.990
Why stick around here?
I've never been anywhere more boring.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.990
You'd be surprised.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Run away with me.

09:10.000 --> 09:10.990
This is intimate.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.990
CREAKING AND CLINKING

09:13.000 --> 09:14.990
What was that?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
It's the ghost.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
CREAKING

09:26.000 --> 09:27.990
THEY GASP, CAT HISSES

09:28.000 --> 09:29.990
Oh, it's a cat! I hate cats!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.990
Oh, you...! "I'm not scared!"

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
THEY LAUGH

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
RUMBLING

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Mum?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Mrs McKinley?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
RAIN POURS

10:07.000 --> 10:08.990
I don't understand.
We saw her come in here.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.990
WINDOW RATTLES

10:11.000 --> 10:15.990
I've been outside the whole time.
She did not come past me.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.990
She's vanished.

10:18.000 --> 10:18.990
Mum?!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.990
Come on, let's search the house.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
DOOR OPENS

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Mum?!

10:41.000 --> 10:43.990
Is that you? Mum?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.990
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

10:46.000 --> 10:48.990
You should be in bed.
Oh, Dad, thank God you're back!

10:49.000 --> 10:50.990
Selina? You all right?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.990
What's he doing here? It's Mum....

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
She's vanished.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.990
You can't explain it,
can you, Father? What?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.990
The "ghost",
or the disappearance? Either.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.990
Maybe they're connected.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Maybe Elspeth's spirit
is taking its revenge.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.990
What was Lady Felicia's term?
Oh, yes...

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
"cobblers".

11:43.000 --> 11:44.990
A clue?

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
This has been
out of print for years!

11:51.000 --> 11:53.990
Father!
You're not going to steal it?!

11:54.000 --> 11:54.990
I'll give it back.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.990
She's hardly going to be
reading it, is she?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.990
Not in the short term.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.990
Father?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.990
You'd better hurry up.
Valentine's here.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.990
DOGS BARK

12:09.000 --> 12:09.990
That'll do for now.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
And don't leave town.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.990
Inspector... What?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.990
This is a big operation

12:19.000 --> 12:20.990
for someone who's only been
missing for a few hours.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.990
It's a potential
murder investigation.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.990
You think she's been killed?

12:26.000 --> 12:26.990
He's done it before.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.990
And got away with it.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.990
I'm not going to let it
happen again. You're saying...

12:31.000 --> 12:34.990
Victor McKinley might
have killed both of them?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.990
Victor was struck off for
mis-prescribing strong sedatives,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.990
and all indications are
that Mrs McKinley was drugged

12:41.000 --> 12:43.990
or Carter and her daughter
would've heard her being abducted.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.990
She could have left the house
of her own accord.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.990
No, she couldn't. Not alone, anyway.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.990
The only other exit
is by the windows.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.990
But there's only two sets of keys,

12:53.000 --> 12:54.990
and Charlotte didn't have
either of them. Who did?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.990
Ah! Finally, you're asking
the right questions.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.990
The builder, Seth Wake, had one.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.990
And the other... What possible
reason would Victor have

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
for abducting his own wife?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.990
I didn't know who else to call.

13:10.000 --> 13:10.990
Well, I'm glad you picked me.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.990
Anything I can do,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.990
anything at all...

13:15.000 --> 13:16.990
I need an alibi.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.990
Sorry?
They'll try to pin this on me.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.990
After what happened with Elspeth,
the Inspector will have a field day!

13:22.000 --> 13:23.990
You want me to lie for you?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.990
If not for my sake,
for my daughter's.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.990
She doesn't deserve
to go through that again.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.990
If I say I was with you,
alone, all evening...

13:34.000 --> 13:35.990
you know what this
means for my reputation.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.990
What reputation?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Insults are not the way to convince
a lady to do you a favour.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.990
It's not that, is it?
You think I might've done it.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.990
No.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.990
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

13:50.000 --> 13:52.990
Mr McKinley, I need you
to come down the station.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.990
I'm not going anywhere with you.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.990
Your wife called
the station last night,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.990
minutes before she disappeared.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.990
Her last words
before she was cut off were,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.990
"I know what happened to Elspeth."

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
What?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.990
How many times?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.990
Elspeth ran away.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.990
She had some...secret boyfriend.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.990
She wanted Charlotte
to start caring for their father
so she could marry him.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.990
Charlotte said no.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.990
So, when her father
went into hospital,

14:23.000 --> 14:24.990
she ran off with her lover
and left us in it.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.990
Leaving her packed bags
waiting on the bed?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.990
If Elspeth had run off with a lover,
wouldn't he be missing, too?

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Yet no-one for miles around
left at the same time.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.990
You were her lover, Victor,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.990
and when she threatened to tell
her sister what you were up to,

14:41.000 --> 14:42.990
you killed her. Not this again.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.990
The house was bolted
from the inside.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.990
By your own testimony,
you, your wife,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.990
and your eight-year-old daughter
were the only other people there.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.990
If Elspeth left of her own accord,
who bolted the door?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I don't know!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.990
CAT MEOWS

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Oh, Marmite, I'm sorry,
you must be starving.

15:16.000 --> 15:16.990
KNOCK AT DOOR

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Selina?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.990
Er, listen...

15:24.000 --> 15:25.990
Lady Felicia's told me
to come and get you,

15:26.000 --> 15:27.990
all right?
She doesn't want you on your own.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.990
We don't even know when your dad's
going to get back. He didn't do it!

15:31.000 --> 15:33.990
He didn't hurt Mum, and
he didn't hurt Auntie Elspeth.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.990
How do you know that? He's my dad!

15:36.000 --> 15:38.990
They can't put him
through this again.

15:39.000 --> 15:39.990
I know I was only little,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.990
but I saw what happened
when Auntie Elspeth went missing.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.990
He fell apart!

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
There must be someone else
who had a reason to kill her.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.990
Inspector,
about Victor McKinley's arrest...

16:00.000 --> 16:01.990
Victor's out.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.990
Lady Felicia's given him an alibi.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.990
Lady Felicia?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.990
I'm amazed you didn't know.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.990
They were sweethearts years ago.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.990
Apparently,
they've rekindled their affair.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.990
God knows where I go from here.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.990
DIGGING

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
What's that?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.990
Oi!

16:26.000 --> 16:27.990
What do you think you're doing?

16:28.000 --> 16:31.990
Heavy rain overnight. The bank
of one of the foundations collapsed.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.990
So? Who knows when work
will start again on this lot.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.990
It's safer to fill it in
and then re-dig later, if need be.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.990
Unless you want somebody else
to disappear?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.990
HE SCOFFS

16:43.000 --> 16:44.990
WOOD CREAKS THEN SNAPS

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Argh!

16:50.000 --> 16:51.990
All right. I take your point.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
As you were.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
What's that?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.990
Sergeant! Sir? Get Dr Miller.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.990
He's going to want to certify this.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.990
We've got a body.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.990
No! Please, no!

17:13.000 --> 17:14.990
It's all right.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.990
It's not your mother.
How do you know?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.990
Whoever that is, they're long dead.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.990
Oh, dear God. A skeleton!

17:23.000 --> 17:24.990
You know what this means, Father?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.990
I'm sure you're going to tell me.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.990
They've finally found Elspeth.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.990
And if Elspeth's dead,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.990
and Charlotte went missing
in exactly the same way

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
they have to be linked! Two murders.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.990
It's Victor McKinley,
you mark my words.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
But Victor's got an alibi.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.990
Gotcha.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.990
It's a woman. They know already?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.990
Awaiting official confirmation,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.990
but she was wearing some kind
of bracelet or necklace.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
They found beads with the body.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.990
I'll call HQ with the news.
If I solve two murders this week,

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
the Chief Constable will
practically be buying me...flowers.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.990
Can I help you, Father?

18:16.000 --> 18:19.990
Yes, I'm here in my professional
capacity, about the body.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.990
I wondered when we might be able
to give her...or him

18:23.000 --> 18:24.990
a Christian burial?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.990
It'll be a while. The coroner's
going to have a job with this one.

18:28.000 --> 18:28.990
Hmm.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
If that's everything?

18:38.000 --> 18:38.990
Sid?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.990
I don't often see you here
voluntarily.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I need to talk to you.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.990
About the case? Yeah,
there's something you don't know.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.990
Elspeth had a lover.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.990
It was all very hush-hush,
her father wouldn't have approved.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.990
So, they needed a go-between,
and I needed a sixpence.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.990
Why didn't you come forward then?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.990
I was a kid. Do you really think
His Nibs would've listened to me?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.990
Anyway, I liked him.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.990
And now? I don't like him.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.990
I've been watching him.
There's something...off.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
DOOR OPENS

19:12.000 --> 19:13.990
Carter...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
what are you doing here?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Sid, the Inspector
needs to know this.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.990
I don't want you getting involved
with this case at the McKinleys'.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.990
If I wanted to be told what to do,
I'd be at home with my husband.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Not in a cheap hotel with you.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Why'd you marry him?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
You didn't look at me twice.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.990
You were born to be
lady of the manor.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.990
Out of my league.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.990
Feeble excuse.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.990
Suppose I'd already
had my fingers burnt.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.990
Who? I meant it.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.990
About Victor McKinley.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.990
The police catch you,
you'll be in trouble.

20:13.000 --> 20:13.990
What's to catch?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.990
After all, I really did
have a room booked that night.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.990
BANGING AT DOOR

20:20.000 --> 20:22.990
Police! Seth Wake, open up!
We know you're in there!

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
(You can't afford
to get caught in here.)

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.990
Yeah? Seth Wake, I am arresting
you on suspicion of the murders

20:33.000 --> 20:34.990
of Elspeth and Charlotte McKinley.
What?!

20:35.000 --> 20:37.990
If your bit of stuff in the bathroom
wants to keep her anonymity,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.990
I suggest you come quietly.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.990
I didn't kill Elspeth!
I didn't kill either of them!

20:42.000 --> 20:43.990
But you and Elspeth were lovers?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.990
You were due at the scene
the night she disappeared.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.990
No! And the day Charlotte McKinley
went missing,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.990
you realised she'd worked out
the truth about you and Elspeth.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.990
You came back that night. No!
Do you have an alibi?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.990
Erm...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Question the woman, too.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.990
Sorry, Guv. She's gone.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Oh, what?!

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
You heard they arrested Seth?

21:17.000 --> 21:17.990
Don't give up hope.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.990
I don't think he'd hurt her.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Especially when these aren't even
his.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.990
What did you do to her, Dad?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.990
No, no, you don't understand...

21:31.000 --> 21:32.990
They'll hang Seth!
You know that, right?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.990
I didn't drug her.
So what are these?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.990
Sweeties?

21:38.000 --> 21:38.990
Are they tasty?
Stop that! Put them down.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.990
If they're not dangerous,
there's no problem, is there?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.990
Is this what you did to Mum?

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Is this how you stopped her
finishing that call? Put them down!

21:51.000 --> 21:51.990
Yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Selina!

22:04.000 --> 22:05.990
Father!

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Is something amiss, Mrs M?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.990
Have you...

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
have you heard anything
in the church?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.990
You mean like the rattling
of ancient chains?

22:18.000 --> 22:18.990
Exactly!

22:19.000 --> 22:20.990
No. Nothing like that.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.990
Father, you're making mock.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I think St Mary's is haunted!

22:27.000 --> 22:28.990
What's this?

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Pear drops. Blood sugar,
that's what you need. Oh!

22:42.000 --> 22:43.990
Am I disturbing you?

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Not at all.
Ooh, what's the riddle?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.990
These numbers and letters in the
dust wrapper of Charlotte's book.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.990
Lots of them are crossed out,
but this set isn't.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.990
I thought it might give us a clue.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.990
I thought, "nine across, seven up."
A location, maybe.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.990
Or the last two clues
of a crossword.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.990
Or a chess move.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.990
Check...mate.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
That was...

23:13.000 --> 23:15.990
I was in the middle of that.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.990
Now that you've finished
"helping me",

23:19.000 --> 23:19.990
what can I do for you?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
What have they got on Seth?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.990
They think he's responsible
for Elspeth's disappearance.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.990
Seth Wake was her lover,
that much he admits.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.990
He says they were planning
to run away together.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.990
He waited outside,
she didn't turn up.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.990
He can't have done it.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.990
The supposition is that
Elspeth changed her mind,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.990
told him she wasn't coming,
they argued, he killed her.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.990
I don't believe
he did anything to Elspeth.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.990
But I know he didn't
do anything to Charlotte.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.990
He doesn't have an alibi.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Yes, he does.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.990
Please, don't stand on ceremony(!)

24:03.000 --> 24:04.990
I need to change my testimony.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.990
I'm sorry? Seth Wake.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.990
He has an alibi for the night
Charlotte went missing.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
He was with me, in my hotel room.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
HE LAUGHS

24:20.000 --> 24:20.990
Forgive me, Lady Felicia,

24:21.000 --> 24:24.990
but are you planning on giving
an alibi to every man I interview?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.990
How many of you were there
in that hotel room, exactly?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.990
How incredibly impertinent!

24:30.000 --> 24:31.990
When you provided
a witness statement,

24:32.000 --> 24:33.990
you signed a declaration
your statement was true.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.990
Are you saying you were lying?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.990
I was...confused.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.990
I got the wrong night.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
Well, Lady Felicia,
how many men are you seeing?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.990
Your statement stands.
Now, stop wasting my time.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Guv'nor?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.990
What is it, Inspector?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.990
The coroner's
report on the skeleton...

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
What does it say?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.990
Apparently, the body was male.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.990
So, not Elspeth?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.990
Top marks for deduction, Father.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.990
I thought it was wearing jewellery?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.990
It was. A bracelet, necklace,
beads, wasn't it?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.990
Heavens' sake, Father.
What does it matter?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.990
As long as Seth's in the clear?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.990
There's no chance of that,
I'm afraid.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.990
Since his arrest,
we've searched his cottage.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.990
We found notes to him from Elspeth.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.990
"Please, don't do anything stupid."

25:36.000 --> 25:38.990
"I don't know if I can
go through with this."

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
"I'm sorry."

25:43.000 --> 25:43.990
She was breaking up with him.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.990
She was afraid of him.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.990
But without the
other side of the conversation,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.990
those notes are meaningless.
We're pressing charges...

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
bodies or no.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
GASPING

26:01.000 --> 26:04.990
Help!

26:05.000 --> 26:06.990
Somebody!

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
Let me out!

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Let me out!

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
BICYCLE BELL RINGS

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
I thought you might want
to make a confession.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.990
It was you who made
the chandelier fall, wasn't it?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.990
You created the ghost
at the house?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.990
I just wanted Mum to move us
back to London.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.990
I didn't know
it would end up like this.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.990
You haven't caused any of this.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
It'll be all right, Selina.

26:44.000 --> 26:44.990
What's this?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.990
St Anthony.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.990
Patron saint of lost things
and missing persons.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.990
So I thought he might help you.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Thank you.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.990
That body they found in the garden,
he was wearing a necklace, wasn't he?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
So the police said.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.990
Maybe it was one of these.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.990
Maybe that's why you found him.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
It wasn't a chain. It was beads.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.990
The body was wearing a rosary!

27:13.000 --> 27:16.990
During the Reformation,
the Catholics were persecuted.

27:17.000 --> 27:17.990
They built themselves hiding places,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.990
priest holes for their holy men,
and their books and their relics.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.990
So, you think that skeleton
was a priest who got caught?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.990
Who didn't make it
to the priest hole in time.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
What priest hole?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
So...

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
..she sat here, reading.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.990
Yes...

27:42.000 --> 27:46.990
Nine across, seven up.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
HE MUTTERS

28:02.000 --> 28:02.990
No.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.990
Maybe your mother's notes
just mean something else entirely.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
That's not Mum's handwriting.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.990
Pray Father, give your blessing,
for I have sinned.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.990
It's been ten years
since my last confession.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.990
This had better be good.
You and Elspeth...

28:35.000 --> 28:35.990
Were eloping. Were lovers.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.990
Yes, I've been through this.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
Were you searching for something
in the house?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.990
There was a family legend,

28:45.000 --> 28:46.990
an old wives' tale,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.990
a hidden hoard,
somewhere in the Manor.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.990
We thought if we found it,
we...could get married.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.990
Leave. Her father
couldn't control our lives.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.990
What happened that night?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
We were going to run away.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.990
We were due to meet
at the pond at six.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.990
I waited all night.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
What do you think became of her?

29:13.000 --> 29:17.990
I think she found whatever
was hidden in that house.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.990
Gold...

29:20.000 --> 29:21.990
jewels...

29:22.000 --> 29:24.990
then just took it.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
What other explanation can there be?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.990
Is this Elspeth's handwriting?

29:32.000 --> 29:32.990
That's right.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.990
Her ones always looked like sevens.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.990
Why, what does it say?

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
It says, "Never give up hope."
HE KNOCKS AT DOOR

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Sergeant? Sir?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.990
What's this?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Search me.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
'Come to McKinley house
as soon as you get this.'

30:24.000 --> 30:25.990
When's he going to learn?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I don't take orders from a priest.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Of course not, sir.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
PHONE RINGS

30:41.000 --> 30:42.990
CHOKING

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
Hello?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Dad!

30:57.000 --> 30:58.990
Help! Somebody, help me!

30:59.000 --> 31:00.990
Selina?

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Father? Help! It's my dad -
he's done something awful.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.990
He's still breathing.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Stay here, I'll call a doctor.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Please. As fast as you can.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
Nine across, one up, not seven.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Ha-haa!

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Charlotte?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.990
LOW GROAN

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Charlotte!

32:26.000 --> 32:28.990
Father, water! Please!

32:29.000 --> 32:31.990
Don't worry,
I'm getting you out now.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.990
Hello?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.990
I thought I told you to stay
with your father.

32:36.000 --> 32:36.990
Mum!

32:37.000 --> 32:40.990
Please tell me that
you didn't move the umbrella!

32:41.000 --> 32:43.990
SOUND OF STONE SCRAPING

32:44.000 --> 32:44.990
DOOR CLUNKS SHUT

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Father?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I knew it was a wild goose chase.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.990
'Which number, please?'

32:59.000 --> 32:59.990
The presbytery, please.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
'Just putting you through.'

33:04.000 --> 33:07.990
'Morning. Father Brown's residence.
Mrs McCarthy speaking.'

33:08.000 --> 33:09.990
Mrs McCarthy, tell the Father,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.990
I'm bringing charges for wasting
police time. But, sir!

33:13.000 --> 33:14.990
Victor McKinley's upstairs.
Out cold.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Looks like suicide.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Why can't they hear us?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.990
This place was built to be
soundproof.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.990
The priests hiding down here were
only safe if they couldn't be heard.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.990
And how did THEY get out?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.990
They didn't!

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Until a sympathiser who knew the
coast was clear let them out.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.990
It had to be utterly secret,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.990
so unless you were in on it, you
wouldn't even know it was here.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.990
Then how did Mum find this one?

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Ah.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.990
The book.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.990
She was reading your Auntie
Elspeth's book

33:49.000 --> 33:51.990
about historic Gloucestershire
houses,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
trying to find out what, or who...

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
..was haunting you.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
The marks inside were Elspeth's.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.990
I imagine no-one has even opened
that book

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
since the night she disappeared.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
The police station, please.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Hello? This is Charlotte McKinley.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
You have to tell the inspector,
I know what happened to Elspeth.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
But if Auntie Elspeth found it
first, why didn't she...

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
No, she can't be.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.990
What's that box?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
The mythical family treasure.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Looks like Elspeth found it
after all.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Much good it did her.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
How could you let Selina follow you?

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I'd come to terms with this, for me.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
She's 17.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.990
There are three of us down here now,
making noise.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Someone will hear us!

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
We're all going to die down here.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.990
It just says "sorry".

36:11.000 --> 36:12.990
Not a confession per se,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.990
but perhaps the alibi Lady Felicia
gave the builder was true,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.990
after all. Ah, the penny drops!

36:19.000 --> 36:19.990
Is Victor going to be all right?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.990
The doctor thinks
he got here just in time.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.990
What are you all doing here, anyway?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.990
Well, it's hardly my fault
if you insist on talking

36:28.000 --> 36:30.990
police business
whilst on the telephone to me.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.990
I'm amazed Father Brown
isn't here to gloat, too.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.990
Where is he, then? And what
about Selina? Where is she?

36:37.000 --> 36:39.990
Don't look at me!
That's another two people missing.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.990
I'll get the men searching
the woods.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
If you want to help,
you can join them.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Charlotte?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Where does this tunnel lead?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I went all the way down there.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
It felt like miles.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I tried banging and shouting, but...

37:12.000 --> 37:13.990
It's just a dead end.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Or really sound-proofed, like down
here.

37:18.000 --> 37:18.990
What does it matter, anyway?

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
We know no-one heard you,
or they'd have helped.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Unless they thought your mother
was a ghost.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Father Brown?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Damnation!

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Sorry.

37:45.000 --> 37:45.990
Listen...

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
I don't do this praying thing often.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
Fair cop, ever. But I've got
a bit of a situation.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
Three people have gone missing.
Four, if you count Elspeth.

38:03.000 --> 38:09.000
If you do exist, maybe you could
see your way to sending me a sign?

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
MUTED CLANKING

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
CLANKING CONTINUES

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Father?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Hello?

39:01.000 --> 39:01.990
Do you come here often?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.990
Inspector...

39:04.000 --> 39:07.990
I have never been
so pleased to see you!

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
HE LAUGHS

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
I'm sorry.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.990
I don't understand.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.990
I thought morphine was for coughs,
and toothache.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.990
But if you have enough,
it's really...

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
calming. And addictive.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
When your aunt went missing,
I badly needed to be calm.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.990
No-one believed it wasn't me.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I believed you.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.990
And the morphine...

39:39.000 --> 39:41.990
that's why they struck you off?

39:42.000 --> 39:42.990
Who told you about that?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.990
I'm not a child, Dad.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I know more than you think I do.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.990
We should never had dragged you out
here without telling you why.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
When your father...lost his job...

39:56.000 --> 39:57.990
..we just couldn't afford to live
that life.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.990
But everything's changed now.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.990
The jewels you found, they're
hugely valuable.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
We can walk away, move back
to London.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
If that's what you want?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.990
Anima eius et animae omnium
fidelium defunctorum

40:16.000 --> 40:20.990
per misericordiam Dei requiescant
in pace.

40:21.000 --> 40:21.990
Ite in pace.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
ALL: Amen.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.990
Go in the peace of Christ.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Thanks be to God.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I heard there was a note for you
with her body.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.990
I shouldn't have stopped looking.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
I should never have believed...
There's nothing you could've done.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
You shouldn't punish yourself
forever.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
I think I'll punish myself
for a while longer yet.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.990
You still won't elope with me?

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Even now I'm an heiress?

41:33.000 --> 41:35.990
Trust me, I am tempted.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.990
But even?10,000 doesn't
make you five years older.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
Come find me in five years, then.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.990
Father?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.990
Can I ask you a question?

41:49.000 --> 41:52.990
The ghost - how did you know
it was me? I didn't.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.990
But when the painting
came off the wall,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.990
I knew someone was pushing the lath
and plaster from the other side.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.990
Seth had left the house and you
were the only one not in sight.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.990
I did everything else.
Hands up to that,

42:04.000 --> 42:05.990
but the painting, I was with Sid.
Ask him!

42:06.000 --> 42:09.990
Oh, come on! Father, I swear on
my mother's life...

42:10.000 --> 42:11.990
It wasn't me.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
And of course, we all know
ghosts don't exist.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.990
Father Brown. Father Brown.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.990
I've heard so much about you.

42:30.000 --> 42:30.990
All good, I hope?

42:31.000 --> 42:33.990
Are you a relative of the deceased,
or...

42:34.000 --> 42:35.990
I hear you got yourself
stuck in a tunnel.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Inspector Valentine had to save you.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.990
Well, I suppose I did, yes.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.990
Meddling. It's a dangerous business.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.990
I'm sorry - who are you? Ah!

42:47.000 --> 42:48.990
You two have met.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Do you mind if I borrow the Father
for a second?

42:53.000 --> 42:55.990
Father, I don't think I've thanked
you properly.

42:56.000 --> 42:56.990
Two cases closed.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.990
Make it three. The skeleton
you dug up in the garden.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.990
I've been doing some digging
of my own in the parish records.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.990
There are references that the
disappearance of a travelling
priest...

43:07.000 --> 43:11.990
And I appreciate you keeping your
investigative involvement on the QT.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.990
Yes, well, my boss isn't that
interested in detective work

43:15.000 --> 43:16.990
so I'm happy to let you
have the credit.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.990
You have no idea what it
means to me.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
Maybe we can work together in
the future. Ah.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.990
I see. You haven't heard.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.990
I'm London-bound.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.990
DCI, Metropolitan Police.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.990
So you see, I really do mean it.

43:34.000 --> 43:34.990
Thank you.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.990
Inspector Sullivan will be taking
over as the new DI of Kembleford.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.990
So, no more meddling, eh?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.990
I don't want to be picking
up the pieces.

43:44.000 --> 43:50.990
You know, I almost think
I'll miss you, Father.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.480
The feeling might be mutual.

43:55.305 --> 44:01.726
