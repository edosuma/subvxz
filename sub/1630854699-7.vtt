WEBVTT

00:30.905 --> 00:33.658
Leif! Leif!

00:34.534 --> 00:35.535
Elena!

00:37.996 --> 00:38.830
Leif!

00:39.539 --> 00:40.373
Mariam.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.501
-Are you all right?

00:43.585 --> 00:45.837
-I think so.
-Any sign of the others?

00:46.838 --> 00:47.672
No.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.219
-Leif's not with you?
-No.

01:10.153 --> 01:13.073
We'll need the ropes
and pulleys from the sails.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.449
It's here.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.086
Pechenegs!

01:28.588 --> 01:29.464
Get down.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.644
I'm Harald Sigurdsson.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.314
A prince of Norway

01:47.440 --> 01:48.358
and nephew

01:49.359 --> 01:51.069
of Yaroslav the Wise.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.922
He says, "Norwegian princes
must be fools to challenge the Dnieper."

02:12.132 --> 02:13.967
And yet I stand before you.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.387
What was your cargo?

02:19.264 --> 02:21.975
Slaves, but they all drowned.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.315
Search the ship.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.622
I think your Khan
should meet a Viking prince!

03:25.705 --> 03:27.373
Hey, hey, Baltzar.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.250
Are you afraid of me?

03:29.751 --> 03:32.003
I thought Pechenegs
were not afraid of anyone.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.965
You should tell him, I am worth much.

03:37.091 --> 03:39.219
If your Khan knew you had a Viking prince,

03:39.302 --> 03:41.054
eh, you would all be wealthy men.

04:02.825 --> 04:06.454
He says,
"Let's find out how valuable you are."

04:47.495 --> 04:49.622
Kurya. Kurya.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.547
Kaysan!

05:00.216 --> 05:02.427
-Have you seen the others?
-No.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.610
Dorn!

05:29.203 --> 05:30.997
-Is she all right?
-Yes.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.000
You made it.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.753
-Any sign of the others?
-No. Not yet.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.465
We must continue downstream.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.426
We need to find them and the boat
before the Pechenegs do.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.032
We know that it exists.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.575
Of course it exists.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.119
I want to know where it is.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.956
We believe
it's somewhere among these islands.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.294
Jomsborg could be
anywhere along this coast.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.297
I could sail for weeks and never find it.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.965
Months, even.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.759
Jomsborg's greatest defense

06:24.842 --> 06:29.263
is that it is invisible from the sea
and only their sailors know the way in.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.850
And what can you tell us
of the waters there?

06:32.934 --> 06:36.938
Very dangerous,
dense fogs and rocky shoals.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.109
You must say a prayer
before you sail there.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.069
Should you find Jomsborg,

06:43.152 --> 06:45.405
please let me know
so I can put it on our maps.

06:48.282 --> 06:51.661
If I find it,
you can forget about Jomsborg.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.415
For it will no longer exist.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.589
Mariam.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.258
Leif.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.719
You all right?

07:08.803 --> 07:10.138
Yes.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.059
But the Pechenegs took Harald.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.729
-He convinced them we were dead.
-What colors did they wear?

07:18.813 --> 07:20.606
-Red and white.
-What's that mean?

07:20.690 --> 07:24.026
It was not the Khan.
Probably a tribe from the east.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.362
Is Cadlin here?

07:27.405 --> 07:28.239
No.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.830
-How is it?
-The hull took a pounding,

07:36.789 --> 07:37.999
but it will float.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.378
Can you get the boat back in the water?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.046
-Yes.
-Do it.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.258
I'm going to find Harald.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.469
-We're coming with you.
-No.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.430
You're needed here to right the boat.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.639
Then we're going.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.224
And me too.

07:56.392 --> 08:00.354
I'm the only one who knows their camps.
I'm your best hope of surviving.

08:05.776 --> 08:06.819
Kurya.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.493
I want you to have this
in case you need it.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.161
But you made this for yourself.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.704
There is only enough for one.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.165
Use it however you choose.

08:20.041 --> 08:20.875
Thank you.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.130
Here.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.759
If you are forced to use it,
fight like an animal.

08:37.892 --> 08:38.726
Let's go!

09:41.414 --> 09:43.874
He claims to be a prince of Norway.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.298
Bring him to my tent.

10:00.141 --> 10:03.185
You cannot really think
this will lift the ship.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.604
We will need ten men.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.856
The two of you will do just fine.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.546
We did it.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.091
Now we just have to get it
off the sandbank and into deeper water.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.604
No!

10:48.939 --> 10:49.774
No!

10:52.068 --> 10:52.902
Cadlin.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.072
No.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.657
Cadlin.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.779
She was a Christian.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.491
I don't know any Christian prayers.

11:42.576 --> 11:45.871
I think you should say
whatever is in your heart.

11:56.298 --> 12:00.052
I felt a better man with her
than when I was alone.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.474
When I was with her…

12:08.060 --> 12:09.895
there was a reason for life.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.028
She was good to me.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.408
As you were to her.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.414
You claim to be a prince of Norway?

13:11.832 --> 13:12.666
I am.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.670
Yet you also say you are a slaver.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.716
I was on my way to Constantinople.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.222
One boat. No army.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.392
It is sad how scared

13:30.476 --> 13:32.770
the Varangians
have become of the Pechenegs.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.441
Once a noble race of warriors,
they used to be trophies to us.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.946
I am not a Varangian.

13:42.947 --> 13:43.989
I am a Viking.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.952
And it's clear to me

13:48.619 --> 13:50.871
there is no Viking skull
in your collection.

13:53.958 --> 13:54.792
Really?

13:55.876 --> 13:57.002
How can you tell?

13:57.086 --> 14:01.382
Because had you faced a real one,
he would be drinking from <i>your</i> skull.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.680
Killing a man in chains is easy.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.850
Fighting a man takes courage.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.145
And I've seen very little of that here.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.567
Are you calling me a coward?

14:20.192 --> 14:23.320
I've already seen
how the Pechenegs challenge a warrior.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.490
Drag him for miles, parch him,

14:27.074 --> 14:28.993
so when a fight is finally offered,

14:30.661 --> 14:32.955
half the battle has already been won.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.422
You're right.

14:42.464 --> 14:45.843
There are other ways
to test a warrior's strength.

14:51.098 --> 14:51.932
Stay low.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.392
Yes.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.441
-I smell fire.
-There's a small camp below us.

15:00.524 --> 15:01.692
Huh.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.861
-Eight tents.
-It is a raiding camp.

15:03.944 --> 15:07.072
Harald would be there.
Can you see the Khan's main camp?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.200
Yes, in the distance.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.454
Kurya and I will bargain
with the leader for Harald.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.165
If they don't bring us horses,
it means we've failed,

15:16.248 --> 15:17.750
and they'll know there are others.

15:17.833 --> 15:21.045
You must get back to the boat
and leave as quickly as possible.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.633
No. We won't leave without everyone.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.179
When the warlord sees me,
he will be required to send for the Khan

15:30.262 --> 15:32.556
and my brother
will return with many warriors.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.100
Your only chance
is to be gone before they arrive.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.942
All right.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.587
Your muscles are less likely to rip

16:03.671 --> 16:05.339
if you can remain still.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.101
Leif.

18:24.895 --> 18:25.729
What's wrong?

18:26.897 --> 18:28.774
You must promise me something.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.068
The Khan will return with many men

18:31.151 --> 18:33.987
and they will catch you
if you try to take me with you.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.241
I didn't come all this way
to leave you behind.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.200
But I did.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.122
Do you know what this is?

18:43.747 --> 18:45.082
Mariam gave it to me.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.251
By bringing me this far,

18:47.334 --> 18:50.671
you have given me the chance
to redeem myself to Ülgen,

18:50.754 --> 18:52.631
the Allfather of my faith.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.300
Now when I die,

18:56.135 --> 18:58.053
he will turn my spirit into a bird

18:58.137 --> 18:59.888
and I will fly to Ocmah,

18:59.972 --> 19:02.891
where my wife
has been waiting for me for a long time.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.107
She'll have to wait
a little longer, my friend.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.980
Cut him down or I kill him.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.858
You know who this is? Do you?

19:52.941 --> 19:54.610
This is the brother to the Khan.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.321
He has a bounty on his head,

19:57.404 --> 20:00.490
which I'm willing to trade to you
for the Norse and two horses.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.288
Go now and tell the Khan.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.113
You all right?

20:40.197 --> 20:42.699
Never better.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.619
Now, the horses.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.308
Something's happened.
They haven't come for the horses.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.776
What do we do? Do we return to the boat?

21:19.486 --> 21:20.737
No.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.285
Come, boys,
gather round. Look who we have.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.462
I think this is where
you thank me for coming.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.090
This is where
I ask if you have another plan.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.150
While we wait for the Khan…

21:59.151 --> 22:00.736
we'll have some entertainment.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.109
Come on!

23:25.195 --> 23:26.029
Elena!

23:34.162 --> 23:35.414
Stop them!

23:49.010 --> 23:50.053
Go, hurry!

23:51.555 --> 23:53.390
-It's me.
-Leif, leave me!

23:54.599 --> 23:55.600
Go, go!

24:14.494 --> 24:16.246
Take them! Catch them!

24:20.250 --> 24:21.626
Hyah!

24:23.086 --> 24:25.088
Go, go, go!

24:52.157 --> 24:53.074
Pull.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.836
Batu, help!

25:06.046 --> 25:07.005
They're coming. Go!

25:26.399 --> 25:27.692
The Khan is behind us!

25:27.776 --> 25:29.861
Everyone on the boat!

25:31.071 --> 25:31.905
Let's go.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.533
Harald is injured!

25:34.616 --> 25:35.450
Get in.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.787
Quickly! Come on.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.459
It's not moving!

25:44.543 --> 25:46.670
Harder! Push harder!

25:47.629 --> 25:49.381
Everyone, push!

25:54.844 --> 25:56.263
Harder!

25:56.346 --> 25:57.347
Look!

25:58.682 --> 26:00.016
-Come on!
-Kurya!

26:00.100 --> 26:00.934
Come back!

26:01.017 --> 26:01.893
No!

26:05.063 --> 26:07.274
Come back! Kurya!

26:21.955 --> 26:23.081
Kurya.

26:23.707 --> 26:24.791
Hello, brother.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.803
I have heard
a thousand tales of you.

26:37.887 --> 26:41.391
shivering in a prison in the north.

26:41.474 --> 26:44.144
And I thought of you often
while I was there.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.983
Did you think about me

26:51.234 --> 26:55.488
killing your wife
while you ran away like a frightened dog?

27:01.286 --> 27:04.539
'Tis a pity you will not see
the pleasure in my eyes

27:05.498 --> 27:08.627
when I put my sword in you.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.463
Dog.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.844
More, push!

27:19.721 --> 27:21.514
-It's moving!
-We're afloat!

27:21.598 --> 27:24.267
Batu, Kaysan, get onboard.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.437
Harald, you too.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.315
It's almost there.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.359
Help me.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.951
Are you so scared of me
that you must use your sword

27:42.035 --> 27:43.870
instead of your knife to kill me?

27:45.413 --> 27:46.539
I am not…

27:48.708 --> 27:49.542
scared.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.379
I don't believe you.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.632
I think it is you who is the coward.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.677
It is you who is frightened

27:58.760 --> 28:02.097
of the blind Pecheneg
who is here to kill you.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.268
Did you say…

28:11.272 --> 28:12.107
to kill me?

28:14.317 --> 28:15.276
You?

28:20.198 --> 28:23.576
Yes, my brother. To kill you.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.456
Eyes…

28:33.336 --> 28:34.421
I cannot see.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.799
-I cannot breathe.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.970
He's poisoned me.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.144
Kill him.

29:46.117 --> 29:50.330
Ülgen, I am ready.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.608
Why did you come back for me?

31:44.736 --> 31:45.570
Because

31:46.571 --> 31:48.197
you would have come back for us.

32:27.111 --> 32:27.946
What is it?

32:28.905 --> 32:29.822
It's Kurya.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.117
On his way to Ocmah.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.226
We've stayed here too long.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.521
The young king believes he's Russian.

33:02.689 --> 33:06.150
He just likes the finer things
of kingship, like his father.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.403
We'll soon have him sorted.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.946
I hope you're right,

33:10.029 --> 33:12.573
because if that
is the future of our people,

33:12.657 --> 33:16.703
then one day, no one will remember
what a Viking king was really like.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.376
Don't slash. Thrust and reset.

33:23.459 --> 33:26.129
You're Olaf Haraldsson,
the Viking Christian

33:26.212 --> 33:29.173
who rid the northlands
of its pagan scourge.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.342
I am, Your Holiness.

33:32.301 --> 33:36.014
Kneel and receive the blessing of Christ.

33:42.645 --> 33:43.604
O, Lord Christ,

33:43.688 --> 33:46.649
bless this mighty warrior
on his journey home,

33:46.733 --> 33:52.572
that he may carry Your message of hope
into the dark regions of our earthly home.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.657
Anoint him with strength,

33:54.741 --> 33:58.411
courage and power
in his mission of Your holy word.

33:58.494 --> 34:01.873
And may his name
be remembered forever and ever

34:01.956 --> 34:05.001
as a faithful servant of Your great works.

34:05.543 --> 34:10.048
In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit.

34:10.840 --> 34:11.758
Amen.

34:11.841 --> 34:12.925
Amen.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.343
-Amen.
-Amen.

34:21.517 --> 34:24.187
Now go, my son,
and do God's work.

34:44.665 --> 34:47.085
You have been
silent for hours.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.462
Are you all right?

34:50.963 --> 34:52.298
I am, Hallbjorn.

34:53.633 --> 34:57.887
For I feel I'm being guided,
directed by the hand of God.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.809
And where is God taking us?

35:04.227 --> 35:05.269
Jomsborg.

35:26.707 --> 35:27.542
Come!

35:32.964 --> 35:34.006
Come in.

35:34.090 --> 35:34.924
Come.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.468
The temple is open to all.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.558
Come.

35:45.476 --> 35:46.394
Yes. Come in.

35:48.855 --> 35:49.689
Come.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.234
Come!

35:54.026 --> 35:55.194
Everyone's welcome.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.709
The temple is open
to all, my friend. Come in.

36:09.792 --> 36:10.668
Thank you.

36:48.497 --> 36:51.209
Come. Yes. Come in.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.740
Hrefna, can you hold him for a little?

37:22.823 --> 37:23.866
Thank you.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.060
Do you have a problem with the changes?

37:52.895 --> 37:53.729
No.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.699
I was just thinking…

38:06.242 --> 38:07.159
of Jorundr.

38:12.373 --> 38:16.294
I made so many mistakes… as a mother.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.467
I wish I could
do things again, only better.

38:24.135 --> 38:24.969
We all do.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.390
But Jorundr's courage
helped all this happen.

38:30.349 --> 38:31.642
He saved me.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.770
He should be celebrated.

38:37.523 --> 38:38.441
Yes.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.193
Come and join us.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.822
There is much to do and we need your help.

39:55.643 --> 39:56.477
A Jomsviking.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.149
Get this man some food and water.
