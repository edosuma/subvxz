WEBVTT

00:52.928 --> 00:55.347
There was no hope
after the apocalypse war.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.101
The world was a stinking charnel house

00:59.226 --> 01:01.436
with bodies rotting in the streets.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.940
And we'd won the bloody thing.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.152
Everyone lost someone, me included.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.948
And because the world
was ending from the damage done to it,

01:13.740 --> 01:15.826
time wouldn't heal those wounds.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.913
But between thoughts of snuffing it,
I had an idea.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.209
What if there was a way to make

01:24.293 --> 01:26.962
all of it never have happened
in the first place?

01:29.047 --> 01:32.884
My plan needed the flash
and his speed to recreate a flash point,

01:33.510 --> 01:34.928
to rewrite the past.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.597
I 'd guide him with magic

01:36.972 --> 01:40.267
to change events
and keep darkseid from ever finding us.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.894
And for my past sins,

01:43.145 --> 01:46.857
I decided to make sure
I paid this bill myself,

01:47.524 --> 01:48.734
no matter the price.

01:56.867 --> 02:00.454
It was the first truly
noble thing I 'd ever done in my life.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.707
And, oh, how it would cost me.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.977
What the shite is this about?

02:39.493 --> 02:40.494
Notbad.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.049
Not the stairs then.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.808
Keep it together, Johnny.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.527
Surprise!

03:14.528 --> 03:15.821
What's all this, then?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.907
It's not every day
a wanker like you turns 50.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.910
Well, certainly not one
with as many demons

03:21.993 --> 03:23.120
that want to kill you.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.149
Stop that, Jason.

03:34.923 --> 03:35.923
Zee?

03:37.342 --> 03:39.344
Tonight is about friends,

03:39.636 --> 03:42.180
family, and having made it
through it all.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.642
And beer. It's also about beer.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.772
John, did you eat
the pickled eggs at the pub again?

03:51.106 --> 03:53.734
I keep telling you,
they don't change them.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.027
No, no, no, it's not that. It's just...

03:56.903 --> 03:58.155
I thought you were dead.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.116
Of course not.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.035
And don't scare the kids
before bedtime with your stories.

04:04.995 --> 04:05.995
Kids?

04:06.163 --> 04:07.581
Daddy!

04:07.706 --> 04:09.624
She won't let me play with her.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.879
Because he's a baby
that breaks my awesome creations.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.966
I told you to treat each other
fair and be nice.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.678
Della, let him play,
and Jack, don't break stuff.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.889
Now give us a kiss and off to bed.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.198
What's the matter?
Zee, some water here.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.372
You too? Come here.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.638
Jack!

05:10.393 --> 05:11.812
Jason, call the doctor!

05:42.467 --> 05:45.428
For god's sake! No, no!

05:45.971 --> 05:48.765
Someone help! Help me. Help!

05:55.063 --> 05:57.274
Zee? You're okay?

06:00.443 --> 06:01.838
Ritchie, if you're taking the piss,

06:01.862 --> 06:05.699
I'll curse you with a ball sack fungus
that won't ever get sorted.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.536
Oh, it's not a joke, daddy.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.582
It's what you deserve.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.549
Happy birthday, John.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.291
Did you get lost
in your own home again, John?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.296
Of course not. Where's my pint?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.715
Hey, hey, hey, who is the dead geezer

07:03.798 --> 07:06.176
we soul cast
to do his comedy act for us?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.677
Edwin tiggley.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.013
John was so sure it would work.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.475
Screwed that spell up royal.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.977
He came back to us
as a rotting corpse.

07:16.102 --> 07:20.774
Worst part was he couldn't
do his pa-pa-pa punch line without lips.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.860
Come on. That made it funnier.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.975
It's just a mouth full of teeth.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.741
Oh, that's good, mate.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.789
You know what to do
with a bad hand, John?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.460
Get rid of it.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.971
Come on, folks, let's give him a hand.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.194
Who's there? Show yourself.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.386
Most people use a match.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.808
Oh, no. Nothing like that.
Just trying something out, you know?

08:37.350 --> 08:38.685
Practice makes perfect.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.269
You think so?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.021
Show me.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.863
You always were the smart one, zee.

08:50.780 --> 08:51.780
Just a minute.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.324
Bloody buttons.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.540
- Kids asleep, then?
- What are you talking about?

09:00.623 --> 09:01.875
We don't have kids.

09:07.589 --> 09:08.589
We don't?

09:08.715 --> 09:10.341
You said you weren't sure.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.761
Have you changed your mind?

09:18.600 --> 09:19.809
I think so. Yeah.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.894
Yes.

09:22.020 --> 09:26.316
Well then, this night
is going to be extra special.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.152
I'm all in. One hundred percent.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.325
Are you sure we don't have kids now?

09:36.326 --> 09:38.203
Name of Jack, maybe delli?

09:38.369 --> 09:40.497
Delli? Very sure.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.581
Come on, John.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.042
I could use some attention.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.002
Right? 'Course.

09:46.628 --> 09:47.628
Ready to go.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.342
But the thing of it is I'm fairly sure

09:52.425 --> 09:55.053
you introduced me to our kids
not too long ago.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.348
Why can't your mind be still?

10:21.329 --> 10:22.455
Stairs it is then.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.941
Okay, Mr. Lamp,

10:50.024 --> 10:53.653
how about we introduce you
to Mr. Window!

10:56.489 --> 10:57.489
Cheeky.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.546
I'll have you now.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.511
Son of a bitch.

11:39.908 --> 11:43.786
Illusion tricks, eh?
I perfected that shite, mate.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.880
Let's see who's winding me up.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.966
Remember how you got here.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.233
Come back to bed, John.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.280
So the manager asks,
"what's the act called?"

12:19.572 --> 12:22.200
And the dad says, "the aristocrats."

12:25.703 --> 12:30.166
- That was truly disgusting.
- And you secretly loved it.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.336
And where do you think you're going?

12:34.879 --> 12:35.879
Theloo.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.925
One in, one out, you know?

13:02.573 --> 13:03.908
Um, fall in, Johnny?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.743
Out in a minute, wanker.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.679
This had better be worth it.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.599
Now remember how you got here.

13:35.940 --> 13:36.940
So that's it then.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.195
Lock me in the house of mystery
and throw away the key.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.365
You have no idea
what you've set in motion.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.869
Changing the earth's past
has created not a ripple,

13:48.411 --> 13:50.288
but a tidal wave of disturbance.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.373
So, my spell had worked.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.502
And spectre, near-god wanker that he is,

13:56.669 --> 13:59.839
took it upon himself to rap my knuckles.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.841
You will no longer be allowed

14:01.924 --> 14:04.677
to meddle with powers
you do not comprehend.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.095
Wait, wait, wait.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.097
What now, human?

14:08.222 --> 14:10.308
I didn't know it was against the rules.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.559
No matter.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.145
What I'm saying is that
others should understand

14:14.228 --> 14:17.106
the high price they'll pay
if they do what I did.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.069
Announce my sentence.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.155
It'll be like putting out a warning cone

14:24.238 --> 14:27.158
on a dangerous street
for us puny mortals.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.955
John constantine,

14:33.581 --> 14:36.376
for changing
your planet's past and future,

14:36.584 --> 14:39.087
you are sentenced to spend eternity

14:39.587 --> 14:41.130
in the house of mystery.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.635
And, of course, I said something cheeky
to piss him off.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.805
If you ever give up
this almost-god thing,

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
you'd be a fantastic town-crier.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.142
You know, hear ye, hear ye!

14:56.521 --> 14:58.731
Your outfit sucks!

15:03.945 --> 15:06.406
Where'd you learn to use the crapper?

15:06.614 --> 15:07.949
Bugger off.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.506
After learning the truth,

15:24.257 --> 15:27.427
the memory wipe and confusion spells
didn't work for long.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.100
This led to me being murdered.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.608
You'd think that would have
been the end of it?

15:39.063 --> 15:40.063
You'd be wrong.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.777
The spectre's vengeance spell
kept resetting me back to square one.

15:45.653 --> 15:49.240
So I got to experience death
at the hands of my friends,

15:49.323 --> 15:53.619
and loved ones over and over again.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.474
Got to the point
where the comical deaths

16:14.557 --> 16:16.142
were a nice change of pace.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.313
Go to sleep, you little wanker!

16:25.693 --> 16:27.278
No telly for you!

17:05.650 --> 17:07.777
Victory! Yes!

17:13.366 --> 17:15.076
And since the house of mystery

17:15.159 --> 17:17.662
is free from the bondings
of normal time,

17:19.705 --> 17:21.874
the days turned into months.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.251
Then years.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.045
Then decades.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.425
And finally centuries.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.596
For me, time was nothing more

17:35.680 --> 17:37.848
than a blood soaked blur.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.476
And just when I thought

17:41.519 --> 17:43.813
things couldn't possibly
get any worse...

17:48.651 --> 17:49.819
You showed up.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.910
Nice to see you, John.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.497
I stand by my decision.

18:02.582 --> 18:06.877
As I said, the world was shite
and none of us had very much to lose.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.260
Oh, I'll show you
how much you have to lose.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.224
Not ready yet, huh?

18:21.225 --> 18:23.019
If the poker isn't cherry red,

18:23.853 --> 18:26.981
I find the victim
doesn't get the full effect.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.901
Anything worth doing
is worth doing right, eh, nergal?

18:32.862 --> 18:33.863
Indeed.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.742
When I heard the spectre's announcement
that you would spend eternity

18:37.825 --> 18:39.660
under glorified house arrest,

18:40.494 --> 18:42.330
I couldn't abide by that.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.957
I own your soul.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.919
I should be the one
to mete out your punishment.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.756
Mom always said, "fair's fair."

18:52.006 --> 18:54.884
You seem content
with your decision.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.054
Perhaps you think an eternity of torture

18:58.137 --> 19:01.098
is worth what you
and your friends received.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.935
Well, challenge accepted.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.191
What's this?

19:11.359 --> 19:14.737
Did you think you were the only one
who wanted to torture me?

19:17.239 --> 19:19.825
Constantine, now I have you!

19:20.618 --> 19:22.370
What are you doing here?

19:23.204 --> 19:27.041
I'm about to torture
this wretch for eternity.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.376
Wrong.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.586
I'll be doing the torturing.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.881
I own his soul. See?

19:34.256 --> 19:38.177
You sold your eternal soul, twice?

19:38.302 --> 19:39.302
'Course not.

19:42.306 --> 19:46.102
I, ashox, second of the fallen,

19:46.310 --> 19:49.355
come to claim this human's soul.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.024
I sold it three times.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.236
Over your dead body.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.533
I own his true soul contract.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.661
I will violently disagree.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.580
I demand you both leave this place.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.999
Or what, you pompous ass?

20:09.083 --> 20:12.378
Precedence. I claim precedence.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.816
- How dare you?
- I will simply break the chains.

20:33.899 --> 20:34.899
Don't do that.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.197
Can't you see the spell
is fueled by our own rage?

20:40.281 --> 20:41.282
Right you are, ashox.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.034
If you all manage to think nice thoughts

20:44.118 --> 20:45.536
about butterflies, kittens,

20:45.619 --> 20:48.456
shite like that,
the chains drop right off.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.374
I will kill you.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.255
Well, that's not a nice thought.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.841
I really have to thank you lot.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.635
I could have never gotten
out of here without you.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.765
See, spectre's much too powerful
for the mere mortal like myself.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.808
So I got him to tell you where I was.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.811
So you three arseholes
could break me out.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.607
- He tricked us!
- You're such a fool.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.568
Why didn't you begin
torturing him immediately?

21:17.693 --> 21:20.029
I was savoring the moment.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.032
But who are you calling a fool,

21:23.157 --> 21:24.867
trapped right next to me?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.787
If the dunce cap fits, nergal.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.497
Enough talk!

21:32.792 --> 21:35.044
Cheers, wankers. See you never.

21:42.885 --> 21:45.179
Taking a stroll
in the world between worlds.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.264
Not bad, Johnny boy.

21:50.601 --> 21:51.601
Uh-oh.

21:57.525 --> 22:00.694
You were supposed to be
imprisoned for eternity.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.030
I guess eternity is not
what it used to be.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.785
- Apparently not.
- Well, off I go then.

22:08.994 --> 22:12.331
Don't you have anyone else
to bother, anyone at all?

22:12.623 --> 22:15.960
At the moment,
you are my most troublesome issue.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.043
What now?

22:17.878 --> 22:20.464
Wipe my memory
until I'm a piece of fruit,

22:20.548 --> 22:22.091
or continue using zee

22:22.174 --> 22:24.468
and the rest of my friends
to rip me apart.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.262
You mistake me, human.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.138
I meant you no ill intent.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.225
What, turning the love
of my life into a succubus,

22:31.308 --> 22:33.394
my best mates into demons?

22:33.894 --> 22:35.312
Seems ill to me.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.274
I put you in a place
where you could spend eternity

22:38.357 --> 22:42.570
with those closest to you
in an endless, perfect dream.

22:43.237 --> 22:46.156
You think yourself
unworthy of happiness.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.326
You are unwilling or unable

22:49.410 --> 22:53.080
to confine your failures
in the past to the past.

22:53.622 --> 22:58.294
- Even when those who died forgave you.
- Bloody hell!

22:59.837 --> 23:02.715
I did it... to myself.

23:03.757 --> 23:04.757
All of it.

23:05.843 --> 23:09.054
I turned zee into a monster
along with everyone else.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.181
I'm broken.

23:11.849 --> 23:15.769
Now, at last, you finally see.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.189
I accept my punishment, spectre.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.733
No more tricks.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.319
I'll stay put, forever.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.280
I tried to shield you
from the consequences

23:26.363 --> 23:27.531
of changing the past,

23:28.240 --> 23:30.284
but that window is now closed.

23:30.993 --> 23:34.830
You know, you god-like beings
can be a real pain in my arse.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.374
Just tell me what you want!

23:38.292 --> 23:40.210
I? Nothing.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.923
It is the universe
that demands restitution.

23:44.465 --> 23:47.051
The universe is a living thing.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.638
The wonders within exist for all of us.

23:55.351 --> 23:59.313
It's glorious. It is!

24:00.105 --> 24:01.482
I can see everything.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.069
I understand now.

24:05.361 --> 24:08.364
It's... Wait!

24:12.159 --> 24:13.369
You were selfish.

24:14.078 --> 24:17.247
You caused the universe harm
by breaking its rules.

24:17.706 --> 24:21.627
And now, the universe
will exact its price.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.713
No, not this. Spectre, help me!

24:25.506 --> 24:26.632
Don't let this happen.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.970
Use your power, spectre. Kill me!

24:31.261 --> 24:33.806
Kill me!

24:36.266 --> 24:39.478
Woe to you, John constantine.
