01:03.620 --> 01:05.244
Hey!

03:05.288 --> 03:06.705
Hey.

04:54.151 --> 04:56.735
And here we go. We're here.

04:56.777 --> 04:59.277
Last stop. End of the world.

05:00.380 --> 05:01.678
Nice driving, babe.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.720
Thanks.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.393
For fuck. Is this it?

05:06.670 --> 05:07.748
It is.

05:07.790 --> 05:10.163
CÃ©im MÃ³r. Big Step.

05:11.460 --> 05:13.238
We circle around and into the valley,

05:13.280 --> 05:14.793
and then it's back here again.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.378
And there isn't even
any phone reception.

05:18.420 --> 05:19.808
Faced with the grandeur of nature,

05:19.850 --> 05:21.718
and that's your concern?

05:21.760 --> 05:24.078
We're trying to be
disconnected for a day.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.198
I know that's very hard.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.398
How long is this hike again?

05:28.440 --> 05:32.088
Roughly 14 miles, give or take.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.330
Jesus, you can feel
the wind from in here.

05:35.790 --> 05:38.307
Good thing we've got men
to keep us safe.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.823
I will always protect you, Babe.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.198
Christ.

05:45.240 --> 05:48.238
Okay, guys, make sure
you have all your stuff.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.428
Water, protein bars, compass,

05:51.470 --> 05:52.528
whistle.

05:52.570 --> 05:54.658
Why would you need a whistle?

05:54.700 --> 05:55.818
Fog.

05:55.860 --> 05:57.968
One second it's clear,
the next you can't see

05:58.010 --> 05:59.378
your hand in front of you.

05:59.420 --> 06:02.058
You know accounts did
their team building in Milan?

06:02.100 --> 06:05.718
Yes, but this isn't team
building. We're already a team.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.233
If slightly dysfunctional.

06:08.584 --> 06:10.988
I just wonder why we chose hell.

06:11.030 --> 06:14.568
I think you'll find it's
a tad colder than hell.

06:14.610 --> 06:16.008
Did everyone else not notice all

06:16.050 --> 06:18.888
the burnt-up cars on the way up here?

06:18.930 --> 06:20.608
You know, I mean, maybe someone should

06:20.650 --> 06:22.858
stay behind and mind the car.

06:22.900 --> 06:26.038
Ben, we all go or nobody goes.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.068
Ben, where's your sense of camaraderie?

06:28.110 --> 06:29.233
Okay, come on.

06:30.230 --> 06:32.051
Let's do it. Everyone out.

06:32.093 --> 06:33.093
Okay.

06:37.670 --> 06:41.323
Oh wow, you can smell the
Heather. So fresh.

06:42.890 --> 06:44.678
How are you feeling?

06:44.720 --> 06:45.768
Yeah, great.

06:45.810 --> 06:46.936
It's the first time I've driven

06:46.960 --> 06:48.910
and a cyclist hasn't wanted to kill me.

06:50.220 --> 06:51.670
I meant medically speaking.

06:52.670 --> 06:53.670
I know.

06:54.350 --> 06:56.158
Look, the doctor says I'm in remission,

06:56.200 --> 06:57.700
so for now that's good enough.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.768
If it gets too much for
you, just tell me, or Ray.

07:02.810 --> 07:05.918
We know what you're
like. You power through.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.913
Okay, everybody. Nobody
leave any valuables in the car.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.200
Backpacks are over here.

07:14.008 --> 07:15.466
Looks like your
husband's running the show.

07:15.490 --> 07:17.912
Mm, the illusion of control.

07:21.460 --> 07:22.510
Nice camera, Susan.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.500
Thank you.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.188
Why, though? Phones are so good.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.308
I got my selfie stick.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.216
To make sure to record
everything that Ben does,

07:32.240 --> 07:34.673
so the office can see
what a little bitch he is.

07:36.150 --> 07:37.650
We should get a group photo.

07:39.340 --> 07:40.340
Everyone line up.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.698
Come on, Ben.

07:50.740 --> 07:51.740
Cheer up.

07:55.490 --> 07:56.490
Cheese!

07:59.240 --> 08:01.888
Oh no, we should get one
with the car in the background.

08:01.930 --> 08:03.768
For the police report.

08:03.810 --> 08:06.888
- Ben!
- Sorry, my bad.

08:06.930 --> 08:08.568
Okay, guys, listen up.

08:08.610 --> 08:10.768
So this path goes for about two K.

08:10.810 --> 08:13.428
It's solid ground, so easy enough,

08:13.470 --> 08:15.248
but after that it's off road.

08:15.290 --> 08:18.428
Forecast is showers, but
we're already in the clouds,

08:18.470 --> 08:20.468
so showers can get pretty severe.

08:20.510 --> 08:22.508
The main thing is to watch your footing,

08:22.550 --> 08:26.518
avoid the ridges and watch
out for the bog holes.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.560
Bog holes?

08:28.820 --> 08:29.820
Jesus.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.058
And I just want to say thank you all

08:33.100 --> 08:35.508
so much for doing this.

08:35.550 --> 08:36.928
I know it's not the Riviera,

08:36.970 --> 08:39.278
but let's just enjoy ourselves anyway.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.670
And, if nothing else,
we'll be fit by tea time.

08:44.470 --> 08:45.470
Yes, don't forget.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.491
Set your FitBits, your smartwatches,

08:47.533 --> 08:50.038
whatever devices you have,
and upload your steps

08:50.080 --> 08:51.328
at the end of the day, okay.

08:51.370 --> 08:52.993
That's really, really important.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.380
Let's go.

08:56.746 --> 08:57.706
Nice message.

08:57.748 --> 08:59.081
Mm, thank you.

09:49.561 --> 09:51.480
Slow down, guys.

09:55.620 --> 09:58.037
Is this okay?

10:01.081 --> 10:02.304
We were just talking about
that, but actually when you

10:02.328 --> 10:04.974
have one crutch, it's the opposite side.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.803
Wow, guys, fun time on the bog.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.550
Oh my God, this is awful.

10:31.236 --> 10:32.358
Just a bit of rain, Ben.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.408
It's not just rain.
Rain comes straight down.

10:34.450 --> 10:36.573
This is sideways, I feel
like a fucking sieve.

10:38.850 --> 10:42.668
People are so shit. Why
would anybody do that?

10:42.710 --> 10:44.246
The first part answers the second part.

10:44.270 --> 10:46.643
Another crusade. She's off.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.620
I was wondering, did she say anything?

10:52.780 --> 10:53.780
Like what?

10:55.280 --> 10:56.630
She wants to have a baby.

10:57.650 --> 11:01.773
Which would ordinarily be
fine, but I can't have kids.

11:03.340 --> 11:04.483
Oh, that's tough.

11:05.670 --> 11:08.348
But I mean, most people decide
not to have kids these days.

11:08.390 --> 11:11.843
State of the world, plus she's
had a health scare, so...

11:13.000 --> 11:15.318
I just think she sees
everything as a challenge.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.960
She won't take no for an answer.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.623
There's talk of a sperm donor.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.793
I don't think I reacted very well.

11:25.780 --> 11:28.597
You'd still be the dad, and a good one.

11:30.578 --> 11:31.578
Yeah.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.678
Maybe a lone parent, though.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.428
No, we both know how tough she is.

11:37.470 --> 11:40.638
How many people face cancer and do this?

11:40.680 --> 11:41.833
Or plan children?

11:43.050 --> 11:44.050
Yeah.

11:46.890 --> 11:47.940
I'm glad she has you.

11:49.210 --> 11:51.733
You always look out for her, for everyone.

11:53.090 --> 11:54.913
I'm not so good really.

11:56.420 --> 11:57.620
Except to people I like.

12:00.830 --> 12:04.483
Bad news, guys. End of civilization.

12:05.580 --> 12:06.748
Thanks for the chat.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.355
If you ever need a shoulder to cry on.

12:08.397 --> 12:10.678
What are you two gabbing about?

12:10.720 --> 12:11.923
Oh, just stuff.

12:13.890 --> 12:15.690
Please tell me that's not the way.

12:17.846 --> 12:19.768
That's the way, Ben.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.398
It's all off road from here, guys.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.688
The next five K is pretty rugged.

12:23.730 --> 12:26.128
The next five K? Fuck.

12:26.170 --> 12:29.203
Okay, everybody just be careful.

12:31.160 --> 12:34.798
All right, single
file, troops. Off we go.

12:46.650 --> 12:48.550
So is this a bog or a marsh?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.163
Welcome to our 30s.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.134
When you're
not in your usual habitat,

12:54.158 --> 12:55.708
you don't know what to talk about.

12:55.750 --> 12:59.208
It's a bog. I think
marshes have reeds and stuff.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.783
You're so good at all this.

13:03.654 --> 13:05.583
I feel like I have the shingles.

13:06.530 --> 13:09.193
You should put
that on your Tinder profile.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.918
It's like being on the moon around here.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.478
Yeah, except there's
no plants on the moon.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.553
You do know that?

13:18.490 --> 13:20.023
Yes, I'm aware.

13:22.250 --> 13:25.208
I was thinking about the
topography in general.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.250
Oh.

13:27.380 --> 13:29.593
Someone paid attention in geography.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.093
It does look like a crater though.

13:35.700 --> 13:38.307
Maybe there was an
asteroid strike, long ago.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.311
See any birds?

14:08.329 --> 14:09.412
No, but...

14:10.475 --> 14:11.475
What?

14:12.213 --> 14:14.257
I thought I saw someone out there.

14:15.273 --> 14:17.028
Out there?

14:17.070 --> 14:19.858
If there was someone, they
might have sunk in a bog hole.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.328
It's pretty treacherous.

14:21.370 --> 14:22.373
Yeah, I suppose.

14:23.710 --> 14:27.073
It was actually really
weird, kinda creepy.

14:29.166 --> 14:31.673
All right, Lisa, as
the designated guide.

14:33.620 --> 14:36.482
Right. Left is no man's land.

14:51.050 --> 14:52.800
He brought up the baby, by the way.

14:54.210 --> 14:55.273
I knew he would.

14:56.118 --> 14:56.909
You should have seen his face

14:56.951 --> 14:58.420
when I suggested a sperm donor.

15:00.789 --> 15:02.189
I bet that went down well.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.290
Where is he anyway?

15:08.220 --> 15:09.223
Oh, here they are.

15:10.820 --> 15:12.883
Did you lose my hubby?

15:12.925 --> 15:14.483
He wasn't with us.

15:20.016 --> 15:21.016
Ray?

15:21.709 --> 15:22.500
Ray!

15:22.542 --> 15:23.850
I think he went that way.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Spread out.

15:28.248 --> 15:29.564
Ray!

15:29.606 --> 15:30.606
Ray!

15:32.653 --> 15:34.268
- Ray!
- Ray!

15:34.310 --> 15:35.496
Ray!

15:39.840 --> 15:41.318
Guys, over here.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.103
Honey, are you okay?

15:44.126 --> 15:45.703
I'm fine, but I hurt my leg.

15:46.930 --> 15:48.530
Stay there, we're coming down.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.453
I've been yelling for like 10 minutes.

15:56.539 --> 15:57.828
Jesus, what happened?

15:57.870 --> 16:01.438
So stupid, I was taking a
selfie. I didn't see the edge.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.201
Babe, try not to move,
okay. You might be concussed.

16:04.243 --> 16:05.034
I'm fine.

16:05.076 --> 16:06.308
Can you feel your legs?

16:06.350 --> 16:07.450
My right one's sore.

16:10.584 --> 16:11.584
Miriam.

16:14.020 --> 16:15.538
Shit.

16:15.580 --> 16:18.438
Okay, honey, there's a
splinter in your leg.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.808
We're gonna have to get it out.

16:19.850 --> 16:22.078
Ooh, wait. Don't.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.278
Why not?

16:23.320 --> 16:25.798
If it's deep in, there's
blood vessels, arteries.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.296
Taking it out could make things worse.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.698
Lisa, he's in pain.

16:28.740 --> 16:29.740
I know.

16:30.830 --> 16:32.130
Give me the first-aid kit.

16:36.850 --> 16:39.248
Okay, I think we should tie it off,

16:39.290 --> 16:41.186
give him something for the
pain, get back to the car.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.793
Ray, we can take it out,

16:43.820 --> 16:45.303
but there's a danger of bleeding.

16:46.860 --> 16:49.824
Well I don't wanna bleed
out on the bog, so...

16:49.866 --> 16:51.331
Okay.

16:51.373 --> 16:53.177
Just in case you're concussed,

16:55.076 --> 16:57.577
that was the most
entertaining thing so far.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.053
You useless fucker.

17:05.610 --> 17:06.908
Sorry.

17:06.950 --> 17:08.850
Does anyone have any phone coverage?

17:12.780 --> 17:14.448
No, nothing.

17:14.490 --> 17:15.628
I'm fine.

17:15.670 --> 17:18.270
I think it's just my pride
that's hurt more than anything.

17:18.312 --> 17:20.645
Should have waited, dummy.

17:22.660 --> 17:25.563
Okay, get everyone,
yeah? You ready to get up?

17:26.423 --> 17:28.511
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

17:28.553 --> 17:29.553
Oh.

17:31.143 --> 17:32.310
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.854
Is there a full moon?

17:45.817 --> 17:48.703
All of these Alpha females.

17:51.260 --> 17:55.403
Ray, this is why you and
I are doomed, my friend.

17:56.390 --> 17:59.725
That splinter could have
gone right into your man bag,

17:59.767 --> 18:02.267
and it wouldn't have mattered.

18:05.715 --> 18:07.118
No, sir.

18:07.160 --> 18:11.343
In truth, there is a better sex toy,

18:13.720 --> 18:15.518
a better book.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.643
Even a cat video is more appealing.

18:20.020 --> 18:23.593
We are witnessing in quite a
literal sense our downfall,

18:24.570 --> 18:25.570
thanks to you.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.166
If this is meant
to make me feel better,

18:28.190 --> 18:29.190
it's not working.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.870
Get used to it.

18:51.057 --> 18:53.499
Mind your legs here.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.363
Hang on a second.

19:06.050 --> 19:07.117
Is it bad, Lise?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.380
I don't think he'll get through.

19:15.460 --> 19:16.763
Guys, listen up.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.938
The rains basically turned
the ground into a swamp.

19:20.980 --> 19:23.168
We need to get to higher ground.

19:23.210 --> 19:24.602
Okay, which way?

19:32.140 --> 19:34.653
Just over the Ridge,
there should be a forest.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.956
If we can cut through, it should lead

19:37.980 --> 19:39.253
to the main road, but...

19:40.303 --> 19:41.303
What?

19:42.430 --> 19:44.398
It's not public land.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.587
Who cares? I mean, who gives a shit?

19:46.629 --> 19:48.529
It's not like we have a choice, right?

19:50.350 --> 19:53.168
Okay, show of hands, who
votes for the forest, yeah?

19:53.210 --> 19:55.708
Up, good, let's go.

19:55.750 --> 19:56.750
Come on up.

19:59.090 --> 20:00.283
I know that face.

20:01.420 --> 20:03.253
Anything in gray is uncharted.

20:04.350 --> 20:05.863
Yeah, but it's a road, right?

20:07.990 --> 20:09.163
That's what it says.

20:10.110 --> 20:13.038
Okay, well I think in these
circumstances, that's enough.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.980
As long as we get the hell outta here.

20:48.010 --> 20:49.010
Wonderful.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.510
Fuck.

20:52.470 --> 20:53.658
Okay, in case of emergency,

20:53.700 --> 20:56.208
I don't think it applies, does it?

20:56.250 --> 20:57.647
There's another one.

20:57.689 --> 20:58.480
Listen, it doesn't matter.

20:58.522 --> 21:00.146
If we don't continue,
we're just going to keep

21:00.170 --> 21:02.720
walking around in circles,
and he's getting weaker.

21:04.110 --> 21:05.360
It's not like the city.

21:06.250 --> 21:09.218
People who live in isolation,
they like their privacy,

21:09.260 --> 21:10.618
for all kinds of reasons.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.876
Oh come on, you make it sound like

21:11.900 --> 21:14.218
we're some sort of invasive species.

21:14.260 --> 21:18.088
Lise, I negotiate
multimillion-euro deals for a living.

21:18.130 --> 21:20.958
My husband has a piece of
fucking tree stuck in his leg.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.198
I honestly think that
if we meet some yokels,

21:23.240 --> 21:25.640
I'll be able to explain
the unique circumstance.

21:26.931 --> 21:28.508
I don't think we should cross.

21:28.550 --> 21:30.668
I think we should stay here.

21:30.710 --> 21:33.023
I'll get back to the
car. I'll raise an alarm.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.228
We have daylight for several hours.

21:36.270 --> 21:38.423
Plus, like you said, he needs a rest.

21:41.183 --> 21:42.183
Okay, here.

21:43.210 --> 21:45.186
When you find help, will you
get them to send an airlift?

21:45.210 --> 21:46.910
I don't care if we're on the news.

21:48.750 --> 21:49.903
Sure, okay.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.630
Be careful, Lise.

22:03.550 --> 22:06.243
Well, guess the age of chivalry's dead.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.120
How so?

22:10.250 --> 22:12.917
You don't think that shoulda been you?

22:14.063 --> 22:15.556
I don't think it's
gone unnoticed that this

22:15.580 --> 22:18.173
mountaineering nonsense is
not my number one skill.

22:20.130 --> 22:24.833
But, now that we have some
time, I could show you what is.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.320
Oh yeah?

22:28.400 --> 22:29.400
Dream on, Ben.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.550
Maybe you can find some sheep
to try it on with, though.

22:36.684 --> 22:37.934
Worth a shot.

23:21.899 --> 23:22.899
Hey.

23:23.682 --> 23:24.948
Hey.

23:24.990 --> 23:26.190
We're leaving now, okay?

23:28.710 --> 23:30.203
Hey, guys?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.410
What's up?

23:36.670 --> 23:38.788
We're going through the forest.

23:38.830 --> 23:40.048
Come again.

23:40.090 --> 23:42.318
I'm not going to sit here
while my husband's in pain.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.078
We all saw what it was like back there.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.288
She's only gone 40 minutes.

23:46.330 --> 23:48.729
Yeah, well, I've decided
something different.

23:48.771 --> 23:50.376
You don't have to come if you don't want.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
You can stay here.

23:52.138 --> 23:53.898
Oh yeah, because I've been expressing

23:53.940 --> 23:55.990
such fondness for this place all morning.

23:56.950 --> 23:58.100
What about the signs?

24:00.250 --> 24:03.224
Do you hear anything? Do you see anyone?

24:03.266 --> 24:04.813
Okay, okay.

24:06.450 --> 24:07.978
Sorry, guys.

24:08.020 --> 24:09.970
It's okay. We'll get
you over that fence.

24:11.738 --> 24:12.529
Ben.

24:12.571 --> 24:14.602
Guys, what about Lise?

24:14.644 --> 24:16.561
She'll figure it out.

24:21.314 --> 24:22.314
Okay.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.278
Ah, trees.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.858
What about them?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.858
Not exactly a goldmine.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.600
You know, makes you wonder
why people get so precious.

25:31.580 --> 25:33.868
I don't think it's unreasonable.

25:33.910 --> 25:37.448
Say it's a farm. Outsiders
can bring disease.

25:37.490 --> 25:38.308
And what about insurance?

25:38.350 --> 25:39.416
They might think we'd accuse them

25:39.440 --> 25:40.790
of negligence or something.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.010
What is that smell?

25:45.460 --> 25:47.107
Whatever it is, it's revolting.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.973
What the fuck is this?

25:55.430 --> 25:57.180
All right, let's just keep going.

25:58.150 --> 25:59.150
No, wait.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.358
Susan, leave it.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.550
Yeah, Suzie, come on.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.630
Oh my God. Jesus Fucking Christ.

26:11.585 --> 26:13.893
What the fuck is this?

26:13.935 --> 26:15.018
Jesus Christ.

26:17.780 --> 26:20.378
Okay, it's dead wildlife,
and that's terrible,

26:20.420 --> 26:22.076
but that's not what we're here for, Suzie.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.688
We have to keep going.

26:23.730 --> 26:24.730
Leave it.

26:25.614 --> 26:27.298
Who the fuck would do this?

26:27.340 --> 26:29.293
You guys go, okay, I'll follow.

26:34.127 --> 26:37.421
Come on. Let's just get out of here.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.755
Ben, you can't do something like this.

26:39.797 --> 26:41.392
It's cruelty to animals.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.610
And it's completely fucking wrong!

26:44.652 --> 26:48.131
Bad things happen to
animals, you know this.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.006
No one has to like it.

26:50.949 --> 26:52.375
I mean, we all know the sanitized version

26:52.399 --> 26:54.291
in the supermarket.

26:54.333 --> 26:56.811
Does it make me a vegan? No.

26:56.853 --> 26:58.311
Am I happy about it?

26:58.353 --> 26:59.915
I try not to think about these things.

26:59.957 --> 27:01.395
I don't give a fuck, Ben.

27:01.437 --> 27:04.187
You can't do something like this.

27:05.275 --> 27:07.283
I don't care who these sick fucks are.

27:08.610 --> 27:10.848
When we get outta here,
I'm gonna report this.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.408
Okay, very good, but in the meantime,

27:12.450 --> 27:13.713
can we just fucking go?

27:24.048 --> 27:27.878
I don't know if now's
a good time, but yes.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.970
On the baby question.

27:30.132 --> 27:31.406
Oh.

27:31.448 --> 27:32.988
What?

27:33.030 --> 27:35.008
We've discussed this hundreds of times,

27:35.050 --> 27:37.618
and now is the moment that
you decide to say yes?

27:37.660 --> 27:39.368
I feel like you'll leave me.

27:39.410 --> 27:42.398
Babe, that's not the
right reason to say yes.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.198
I don't want you to do this just for me.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.978
I want you to do it for you as well.

27:46.020 --> 27:49.155
If it makes you happy,
that's all that matters to me.

27:49.197 --> 27:50.308
I think you have a fever.

27:50.350 --> 27:51.350
I do.

27:52.163 --> 27:53.606
Lovesickness.

27:53.648 --> 27:54.777
Oh God.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.040
That's a car.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.057
Oh, thank God.

28:09.305 --> 28:10.388
Or maybe not.

28:14.410 --> 28:16.323
Okay, everybody just stay calm.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.223
I don't think your gay
wave's gonna help us much.

28:24.640 --> 28:25.713
Who breaks the ice?

28:27.380 --> 28:28.380
Is it us?

28:29.205 --> 28:30.628
Or them?

28:30.670 --> 28:33.668
Look, I'll explain the
situation. This was my idea.

28:33.710 --> 28:35.113
No, I'll do it.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.338
Are you sure?

28:38.380 --> 28:39.471
Yeah.

28:48.900 --> 28:51.443
Morning. Afternoon.

28:56.410 --> 28:59.595
How's it going, boys? Girls?

29:05.450 --> 29:06.450
Strangers, is it?

29:08.330 --> 29:10.080
Out for a bit of roaming?

29:10.122 --> 29:11.122
Steevy.

29:13.077 --> 29:14.928
Are you lost?

29:14.970 --> 29:15.970
No, not exactly.

29:17.564 --> 29:20.328
A friend of ours got into
an accident up in the bog.

29:20.370 --> 29:21.673
Taking a shite, was he?

29:22.830 --> 29:23.830
Steevy, shut up.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.132
We just got cut off by the rain.

29:31.260 --> 29:32.833
What do you think they're saying?

29:33.860 --> 29:36.288
Let's just go back and wait for Lise.

29:36.330 --> 29:38.658
I don't like this.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.168
Not to spoil the party,

29:40.210 --> 29:42.223
but I don't think I
can make it back there.

29:43.990 --> 29:47.373
Okay, look, nobody say
anything about anything.

30:01.640 --> 30:02.978
Hi.

30:03.020 --> 30:05.793
I'm sorry for disturbing,
but my husband fell.

30:06.730 --> 30:08.968
I hear yous were out on the hill, yeah?

30:09.010 --> 30:10.803
Yeah, hiking, for charity.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.488
What's the cause?

30:13.530 --> 30:14.583
Cancer research.

30:15.820 --> 30:17.448
Waste of time and money.

30:17.490 --> 30:20.470
Sure there's no cure for that fucker.

30:22.370 --> 30:24.543
Don't mind that fella. You're all right.

30:28.111 --> 30:29.111
The leg, is it?

30:30.110 --> 30:31.110
Yeah.

30:31.810 --> 30:34.671
Sure, hop in the back
there. We'll give you a ride.

30:34.713 --> 30:37.138
No really, we're fine.
We don't wanna disturb you.

30:37.180 --> 30:39.843
If you could just point us in
the right direction actually.

30:41.530 --> 30:45.533
Well, it's, it's several
miles, you know. Rough ground.

30:46.715 --> 30:48.578
The river'll be swollen
after all that rain.

30:48.620 --> 30:50.133
There's no bridge that direction.

30:51.234 --> 30:53.494
Look, we'll get you halfway there.

30:53.536 --> 30:54.833
You can make a phone call.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.408
If you're sure it's no trouble.

30:58.450 --> 30:59.900
Driving's fierce hard work.

31:01.810 --> 31:03.948
Steevy, give them a
hand there, will you?

31:03.990 --> 31:04.828
Thank you.

31:04.870 --> 31:07.533
Why don't you get in the
back with Goldilocks there?

31:32.500 --> 31:36.223
Do yous like it hot or cold?
This is our air con out here.

31:37.790 --> 31:38.790
Hot, is it?

31:44.097 --> 31:46.998
So do they pay you'se for walking?

31:47.040 --> 31:47.838
It's sponsorship.

31:47.880 --> 31:50.478
You walk a certain number of miles,

31:50.520 --> 31:52.068
and then you raise a certain amount.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.268
It's like fundraising.

31:54.310 --> 31:57.053
That's a mighty explanation.
I'm all clear now.

31:58.051 --> 31:59.868
But for walking, though?

31:59.910 --> 32:01.418
Pretty much.

32:01.460 --> 32:02.577
Pretty all right.

32:05.260 --> 32:06.888
So, are we close to your farm?

32:06.930 --> 32:08.138
Why?

32:08.180 --> 32:10.528
No reason, just curious.

32:10.570 --> 32:12.027
Curious people, are you?

32:12.890 --> 32:14.241
No.

32:14.283 --> 32:16.993
Did you see a sign when
you come in from the bog?

32:18.380 --> 32:21.878
This is all private property.
You know, no right of way.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.015
I didn't see any
signs. You see any signs?

32:24.057 --> 32:25.813
No, no. Nothing.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.108
Only city people'd be paid for walking.

32:30.150 --> 32:32.407
You know, yous are cute, in every way.

32:35.950 --> 32:37.178
So you own the whole forest.

32:37.220 --> 32:39.898
I believe there's a
lot of money in timber.

32:39.940 --> 32:43.473
Beetles, fungus, rot. No money.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.888
The damp, you see.

32:46.930 --> 32:49.972
Fucking damp. What a shame.

32:50.014 --> 32:51.618
It's a shame all right.

32:51.660 --> 32:52.660
I like your Jeep.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.591
What do you like about it?

32:55.633 --> 32:57.883
It's old. Unique.

32:58.950 --> 33:00.628
You see, if Steevy had put the isopan on

33:00.670 --> 33:03.133
like I asked him to, be
all right, wouldn't it?

33:34.713 --> 33:35.796
There you go.

33:41.615 --> 33:43.126
Come inside, we'll get you warm and dry.

33:43.150 --> 33:45.628
Make a phone call from
in there if you want.

33:45.670 --> 33:48.426
No, honestly, we're
fine out here. Thanks.

33:48.468 --> 33:49.948
If that's fine, I'd hate to see bad,

33:49.990 --> 33:51.240
especially that poor man.

33:53.152 --> 33:54.152
Come on.

33:56.983 --> 33:57.983
Okay.

34:28.747 --> 34:30.097
Sit him down there.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.508
Honey, you're gonna be all right.

34:41.550 --> 34:43.150
We're gonna get some help, okay?

34:48.690 --> 34:50.457
Take a seat at the table. Go on.

35:17.520 --> 35:21.603
Steevy, go up to Pappy's old room there.

35:21.645 --> 35:24.693
Call Mountain Rescue. And
get them up here quick.

35:27.617 --> 35:28.893
Do you hear me looking at you?

35:39.559 --> 35:41.323
Sure we'll have a cup of tea?

35:47.970 --> 35:50.320
It's great to get the
weight off the feet, huh?

35:54.400 --> 35:55.550
Thanks for your help.

35:57.230 --> 35:58.930
He's gonna be all right, isn't he?

36:00.930 --> 36:01.930
Ah, yeah.

36:02.695 --> 36:05.103
Get a bit of heat into him,
he'll be right as rain.

36:08.490 --> 36:10.513
So you're all brothers?

36:12.020 --> 36:13.573
Oh, me and Tadhg.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.753
Oh, I'm Neil, by the way.
I never introduced meself.

36:18.258 --> 36:20.888
The other fella, sure,
what would you call him?

36:20.930 --> 36:21.721
Cunt.

36:21.763 --> 36:22.763
Nephew.

36:34.900 --> 36:36.558
Oh, you'll have to forgive the decor.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.800
We're a bit primitive
around here, you know.

36:40.050 --> 36:41.900
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?

36:43.450 --> 36:44.623
Oh, yeah.

36:45.530 --> 36:46.730
How's your constitution?

36:51.750 --> 36:55.081
We call it the privy
house. It's out that way.

36:55.123 --> 36:56.308
To your right.

36:56.350 --> 36:57.350
Thanks.

37:00.360 --> 37:04.391
Oh, it's the maid's day off,
by the way. Just so you know.

38:00.509 --> 38:01.509
Shit.

38:12.843 --> 38:15.163
Remind me to get a tetanus shot.

38:21.530 --> 38:22.530
Yous all right?

38:23.610 --> 38:25.913
I was just admiring your fish.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.273
Oh, that's Pikey.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.368
He nearly took the finger off me.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.948
I was trying to get a Cooper spoon out

38:32.990 --> 38:34.317
of his mouth and aarrk.

38:36.050 --> 38:38.250
Gave him a fierce whack
in the head, though.

38:39.142 --> 38:41.627
And there he is now, up
there, looking down on us, uh?

38:43.327 --> 38:46.990
How long do you think it'll
take for help to arrive?

38:47.032 --> 38:49.518
How long do think it'll
take help to arrive, Tadgh?

38:49.560 --> 38:51.884
It shouldn't take very long.

38:51.926 --> 38:53.276
Shouldn't take very long.

38:59.836 --> 39:01.418
What line of work do you do?

39:01.460 --> 39:02.460
Business.

39:03.850 --> 39:05.023
Not journalism no?

39:06.520 --> 39:07.520
No.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.120
How'd you get on?

39:13.310 --> 39:14.310
Fine.

39:15.724 --> 39:17.024
Do you take photographs?

39:18.980 --> 39:20.403
Just Heather.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.108
Nothing else, no?

39:24.150 --> 39:25.150
No.

39:26.920 --> 39:27.920
No.

39:32.130 --> 39:34.213
Did you manage to
get through to someone?

39:35.490 --> 39:37.458
Oh yeah, some lad's
coming up with a yoke

39:37.500 --> 39:39.053
for fixing fuckers' legs.

39:44.890 --> 39:46.440
Will you show us the Heather?

39:48.640 --> 39:50.518
It's a dead battery.

39:50.560 --> 39:53.253
Using the flash is a whore.
Do you not have a spare?

39:58.310 --> 39:59.360
Is something funny?

40:01.200 --> 40:02.200
No.

40:03.110 --> 40:04.110
Then what?

40:06.120 --> 40:08.128
People from the city think that people

40:08.170 --> 40:10.633
from the country are fucking amadans.

40:12.496 --> 40:14.083
Idiots of the highest order.

40:15.370 --> 40:19.078
Culchies! Do you know
where the word came from?

40:19.120 --> 40:21.231
CÃºl-an-TÃ­, literally.

40:21.273 --> 40:24.048
The back end of the house.

40:24.090 --> 40:26.040
Guys, we don't want any trouble here.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.533
Sure I know you don't,
the gormless head on you.

40:30.550 --> 40:33.297
But you mean to bring
trouble in on me.

40:35.199 --> 40:36.788
Oh yeah.

40:36.830 --> 40:40.173
You saw something. You think
you saw something.

40:41.663 --> 40:44.593
With your notions looking
around all high and mighty.

40:46.150 --> 40:47.768
Do you think I'm going to let you walk

40:47.810 --> 40:50.257
outta here and bring shite
in on me, huh?

40:51.760 --> 40:53.407
I got some bad news for you.

40:58.417 --> 41:01.253
You're in the back of beyond now.

41:07.087 --> 41:09.017
What did you give her?

41:09.059 --> 41:11.272
That's what you get
for trespassing.

41:11.314 --> 41:14.231
Miriam.

41:34.498 --> 41:36.406
What did you do to her?

42:37.628 --> 42:40.961
Steevy, stop horsing around, will you?

42:45.631 --> 42:46.631
Lads?

42:47.950 --> 42:49.393
This is all a big mistake.

42:52.210 --> 42:55.053
Just keep the camera, and
we walk right outta here.

42:55.970 --> 42:58.205
Sure, they all say that.

42:58.247 --> 42:59.603
Sure, I won't tell.

43:00.465 --> 43:03.195
Do you think any of them ever meant it?

43:03.237 --> 43:04.237
No.

43:07.483 --> 43:09.473
I don't give a shit about your deer,

43:10.356 --> 43:11.968
or your wild animals.

43:12.010 --> 43:14.263
I happen to like venison.

43:16.830 --> 43:18.463
What I like more is breathing.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.928
There's a photograph on the camera,

43:22.970 --> 43:24.370
five of yous around the car.

43:26.430 --> 43:27.430
Jeep.

43:29.170 --> 43:31.168
Don't be a smart-ass
this stage of your life.

43:31.210 --> 43:32.398
Same fucking thing.

43:32.440 --> 43:33.708
Not really like.

43:33.750 --> 43:35.050
I'm fucking warning you.

43:38.170 --> 43:40.193
So, five of yous.

43:42.191 --> 43:43.191
Who's Blondie?

43:46.750 --> 43:48.680
Some hillwalker we bumped into.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.360
Out for a stroll, huh?

43:54.903 --> 43:55.903
Yeah.

43:57.460 --> 44:01.321
Do you know what the
opposite of a culchie is?

44:01.363 --> 44:02.363
A jackeen.

44:03.775 --> 44:06.701
A contemptuous designation
for a worthless fellow.

44:06.743 --> 44:08.922
I read that somewhere.

44:08.964 --> 44:11.297
Are you? A worthless fellow?

44:14.720 --> 44:17.088
You see, while you were sleeping

44:17.130 --> 44:18.830
I had a root around on your phone.

44:19.770 --> 44:21.896
And I found loads of pictures
of Blondie and yourself,

44:21.938 --> 44:24.143
different places, all nice places now.

44:26.260 --> 44:28.628
Okay, okay. She's a colleague.

44:28.670 --> 44:30.363
She went back to the Jeep.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.698
She's not involved. She
wasn't even on your land.

44:33.740 --> 44:35.603
You're saying it is a Jeep?

44:37.850 --> 44:38.998
Will you shut up?

44:39.040 --> 44:42.018
I'll give you a root up the fucking hole.

44:42.060 --> 44:45.060
Why does he get to call it
right but I'm the fucking cunt?

44:46.618 --> 44:48.701
Because you are a cunt.

44:53.020 --> 44:54.020
So.

44:55.270 --> 44:59.803
How long since Blondie
went back to your, vehicle?

45:06.063 --> 45:09.432
About an hour, hour and a half.

45:09.474 --> 45:10.474
An hour.

45:20.177 --> 45:25.048
Steevy, I want you to stay
here, mind our guests.

45:25.090 --> 45:26.654
Mind, do you hear?

45:26.696 --> 45:28.198
Do you not see me nodding?

45:28.240 --> 45:30.566
I'll nod the fucking
head off you in a minute.

45:30.608 --> 45:34.108
Just do as you're told for once, will you?

45:36.797 --> 45:37.797
Come on you.

45:38.520 --> 45:42.595
Oh, and, uh, just relax. You'll be grand.

46:10.300 --> 46:12.125
What's wrong with you?

46:12.167 --> 46:14.798
There's a lot of them.

46:14.840 --> 46:15.840
More than usual.

46:16.860 --> 46:18.510
Do you think I don't know that?

46:19.377 --> 46:20.386
If we don't find this black sheep,

46:20.410 --> 46:21.760
we say goodbye to the farm.

46:24.679 --> 46:27.334
Steevy and his fucking pelts.

46:35.329 --> 46:36.412
Who's this?

46:39.633 --> 46:40.633
A friend?

46:41.804 --> 46:44.221
You're a friendly, boy-o.

46:45.143 --> 46:47.815
Do you have any porn on this?

46:47.857 --> 46:48.857
No.

46:50.633 --> 46:51.800
Are you gay?

46:54.040 --> 46:54.868
No.

46:54.910 --> 46:57.940
Like you're good-looking.
Not that I'd fuck you now.

46:57.982 --> 47:00.307
But you have a certain aura about you.

47:02.830 --> 47:05.237
Tell me, which of the two
girls with you is best?

47:05.279 --> 47:06.863
Is it Goldilocks or the brown bear?

47:08.015 --> 47:09.725
They're good people.

47:09.767 --> 47:11.527
I'm not fucking talking about people.

47:11.569 --> 47:12.986
I'm talking about

47:14.010 --> 47:15.493
carnal knowledge.

47:17.200 --> 47:18.813
See to me, you're a strange lad.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.738
You're not married. You
have no ring on you.

47:21.780 --> 47:23.690
You're not gay, so you say.

47:25.060 --> 47:27.174
So what's the word for you then, huh?

47:27.216 --> 47:28.338
Jackeen?

47:28.380 --> 47:29.593
No wait, you might be.

47:30.820 --> 47:31.688
No.

47:31.730 --> 47:32.930
Can you be a frigid man?

47:36.010 --> 47:37.606
Look, if you're being forced to do this,

47:37.630 --> 47:40.063
you don't have to, there
is another choice here.

47:42.253 --> 47:43.420
What's that?

47:46.173 --> 47:47.793
Help us to get outta here.

47:48.710 --> 47:51.210
We'd say that you did. We
won't press any charges.

47:52.260 --> 47:53.860
You'll probably get all of this.

47:56.203 --> 47:57.683
The whole farm?

47:59.880 --> 48:02.067
Yes, everything. Right?

48:05.589 --> 48:09.138
See the beardy fella's
right. You think we're stupid.

48:09.180 --> 48:11.818
But worse, you think I'm stupid.

48:11.860 --> 48:14.223
No no no, I think
you're actually clever.

48:15.210 --> 48:17.043
You know the right choice here.

48:18.159 --> 48:19.319
And how would you think that?

48:19.357 --> 48:21.558
Are you reading me mind?

48:21.600 --> 48:24.277
Because if you are,
what am I thinking now?

48:28.907 --> 48:32.135
I'm thinking, where did those two fuckers

48:32.177 --> 48:34.420
hide the custard creams, huh?

48:56.978 --> 48:57.978
Oh no.

48:59.323 --> 49:01.583
What? What is it?

49:01.625 --> 49:03.218
I just realized something.

49:03.260 --> 49:04.673
Did you piss yourself?

49:06.938 --> 49:08.410
You're insane.

49:13.696 --> 49:16.649
I am, yeah.

49:16.691 --> 49:17.961
I am.

49:31.300 --> 49:33.193
See this is only kind of a farm.

49:34.130 --> 49:37.083
There's animals around the
place, wild and dangerous.

49:38.030 --> 49:40.913
But most of them are on two legs.

49:54.180 --> 49:55.180
Is that her?

49:55.860 --> 49:57.110
Put on your happy face.

49:58.325 --> 50:00.931
Another minute, we'd be fucked.

50:14.260 --> 50:17.663
Hey there, are you Lisa?

50:19.415 --> 50:22.418
We found your friends. They're safe.

50:22.460 --> 50:23.726
They told us to come and get you.

50:23.750 --> 50:25.778
They need you to drive them.

50:25.820 --> 50:29.187
You can follow on up in
your car, if you like.

50:33.980 --> 50:35.430
This bitch is deaf or dumb.

50:37.610 --> 50:40.403
No, no she's not. She's neither.

50:46.747 --> 50:49.080
Is she taking our picture?

50:52.830 --> 50:54.558
There's no signal.

50:54.600 --> 50:58.068
Didn't you rip all the
wires outta the five G mast?

50:58.110 --> 50:59.410
She won't be sending them.

51:01.460 --> 51:02.498
I could shoot her now

51:02.540 --> 51:05.855
instead of standing here like a gombeen.

51:05.897 --> 51:08.328
No, 50 yards from the
motorway and a motorcycle goes

51:08.370 --> 51:11.207
past and sees you, that's
some fucking plan all right.

51:12.559 --> 51:14.103
No, here's what I want you to do.

51:15.050 --> 51:17.848
I want you to go up there
and introduce yourself.

51:17.890 --> 51:21.207
Show her what a fine, upstanding
fellow you really are.

51:22.656 --> 51:24.923
And come here to me. No messing.

51:26.020 --> 51:27.458
Make it clean.

51:27.500 --> 51:30.303
And when you're finished,
get the car keys.

51:31.405 --> 51:32.655
And that phone.

52:09.480 --> 52:11.633
We're going through the forest.

52:13.070 --> 52:15.467
Do you hear anything? Do
you see anyone.

52:17.202 --> 52:18.108
People who live in isolation

52:18.150 --> 52:19.927
like their privacy.

52:22.080 --> 52:24.680
Thought I saw someone out there.

52:27.679 --> 52:32.679
Waste of time and money.

52:33.190 --> 52:35.820
What the fuck is this?

52:35.862 --> 52:38.023
It's dead wildlife.

52:47.230 --> 52:48.313
Babe.

52:51.970 --> 52:52.970
Babe?

52:56.190 --> 52:57.190
Babe.

53:00.678 --> 53:01.678
Ray.

53:02.348 --> 53:05.008
What the fuck's happening?

53:05.050 --> 53:06.828
I made a mistake.

53:06.870 --> 53:09.470
I made a terrible mistake,
and now we're in trouble.

53:10.668 --> 53:13.210
And I don't know how to get us out of it.

53:15.140 --> 53:16.140
Can you get loose?

53:17.510 --> 53:18.510
I'll try.

53:22.900 --> 53:25.038
I think I can cut these.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.080
Okay.

53:27.570 --> 53:28.570
Hang on.

53:31.281 --> 53:32.281
Okay.

53:35.926 --> 53:38.102
Shut up do you here me!

53:38.144 --> 53:39.882
Someone's coming.

54:58.687 --> 55:00.854
Get the fuck away from me!

55:02.350 --> 55:04.863
I knew you were cute. Cute as a fox.

55:05.840 --> 55:07.828
Please leave us alone.

55:07.870 --> 55:09.794
So you're awake as well?

55:09.836 --> 55:10.845
Mighty.

55:10.887 --> 55:12.891
But sure as fuck no one's talking to you.

55:15.933 --> 55:19.108
Is he your husband? Is he rich?

55:19.150 --> 55:21.352
Geez, he must be unless you're blind.

55:21.394 --> 55:23.118
Are you blind?

55:23.160 --> 55:24.160
I am rich.

55:24.890 --> 55:27.365
I'll give you money. Just let us go.

55:27.407 --> 55:29.578
Go where? The guards?

55:29.620 --> 55:30.411
Yes, you're honor.

55:30.453 --> 55:33.128
Sure, we had them tied up
but it was only the craic.

55:37.650 --> 55:39.023
Can I have sex with her?

55:41.610 --> 55:42.943
Don't you fucking dare.

55:43.991 --> 55:47.135
If you lay a finger on
me, I swear I'll kill you.

55:47.177 --> 55:50.004
You kill me? And how will you do that?

55:50.046 --> 55:52.948
Do you have laser eyes?
Do you breathe fire?

55:52.990 --> 55:53.781
Huh?

55:53.823 --> 55:56.603
Hubby? Sure, he's not answering.

55:57.610 --> 56:00.948
If you let us go,
drive us somewhere safe,

56:00.990 --> 56:03.133
I'll give you 100,000 cash, no questions.

56:04.450 --> 56:06.587
Sure you get that for washing diesel.

56:06.629 --> 56:08.328
200.

56:08.370 --> 56:10.393
No, two million. No no.

56:11.770 --> 56:12.770
Four million.

56:14.520 --> 56:17.690
All right. Yeah, I can
do that, whatever you need.

56:19.090 --> 56:20.673
Fucking wasting me time.

56:24.140 --> 56:25.323
How about you, Brownie?

56:27.070 --> 56:29.020
Let's see you try and kill me now, huh?

57:21.360 --> 57:22.693
Fuck!

57:48.987 --> 57:49.987
Ray?

57:51.455 --> 57:52.455
No.

57:54.936 --> 57:57.933
Ray. What did you do?

58:00.881 --> 58:02.731
Listen, you need to get outta here.

58:04.689 --> 58:06.439
Before he comes back.

58:07.491 --> 58:08.282
Go.

58:08.324 --> 58:09.420
You're coming with me.

58:15.270 --> 58:18.270
Please, I can't make it without you.

58:22.460 --> 58:23.793
You always do.

58:26.139 --> 58:27.596
You're the boss.

59:51.086 --> 59:54.169
Where is it you think you're going?

1:00:39.834 --> 1:00:40.834
Steevy?

1:00:43.935 --> 1:00:44.935
Steevy?

1:00:49.262 --> 1:00:50.262
Yeah.

1:00:51.390 --> 1:00:52.590
Steevy, where are you?

1:00:54.810 --> 1:00:56.110
Oh, just taking a shite.

1:01:00.076 --> 1:01:03.673
All right, listen, don't
fuck anything up there.

1:01:05.070 --> 1:01:07.258
Yeah, it's going grand.

1:01:07.300 --> 1:01:09.013
You fucking cunt, you.

1:01:10.300 --> 1:01:11.300
All right.

1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:14.057
Dirty little bollocks.

1:02:19.204 --> 1:02:20.204
Susan?

1:02:22.543 --> 1:02:23.543
Susan.

1:02:25.111 --> 1:02:26.194
Susan, Susan.

1:02:27.511 --> 1:02:29.007
Susan.

1:02:29.049 --> 1:02:29.840
Miriam.

1:02:29.882 --> 1:02:31.743
Sh, you're okay. Did they hurt you?

1:02:32.822 --> 1:02:34.313
No no, but they will.

1:02:36.270 --> 1:02:37.993
Where's Ben, and Ray?

1:02:43.427 --> 1:02:44.821
Oh my God.

1:02:44.863 --> 1:02:46.448
Listen, we're gonna fight this.

1:02:46.490 --> 1:02:48.590
We're going to get out of here, all right?

1:02:50.900 --> 1:02:51.824
Can you get up?

1:02:51.866 --> 1:02:55.175
Yeah.

1:02:55.217 --> 1:02:56.217
Okay.

1:02:57.347 --> 1:02:58.430
Are you okay?

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:02.520
Girls.

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:04.780
How are you?

1:03:07.450 --> 1:03:09.908
You're getting a great tour
of the old farm, aren't you?

1:03:09.950 --> 1:03:12.238
Seeing all the best places.

1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:14.408
See that? That's Dennis.

1:03:14.450 --> 1:03:16.853
He was a fierce fucking beast now!

1:03:16.895 --> 1:03:18.511
Whatever happens, trust me.

1:03:18.553 --> 1:03:19.753
Did you say something?

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:22.140
How's your shoulder?

1:03:23.220 --> 1:03:26.503
Oh, it's throbbing. Sure,
like all the best parts of me.

1:03:27.770 --> 1:03:29.153
How's your husband?

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:33.482
Ah no, that's a bad fucking question.

1:03:33.524 --> 1:03:34.696
I went in to see him there now,

1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:37.328
and he's bled out like a stuck pig.

1:03:37.370 --> 1:03:39.218
You didn't see the yoke
he pulled from his leg.

1:03:39.260 --> 1:03:40.703
Look, that's it.

1:03:41.630 --> 1:03:45.068
Look, who goes into the bog,
a place with no fucking trees,

1:03:45.110 --> 1:03:46.460
and gets that stuck in him?

1:03:47.501 --> 1:03:49.977
Are you sure it wasn't in the woods?

1:03:50.019 --> 1:03:51.328
No.

1:03:51.370 --> 1:03:53.578
Don't mind me. I'm only being a whore.

1:03:53.620 --> 1:03:55.853
It's your fault, you know, he's dead.

1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:58.600
And how is that?

1:03:59.950 --> 1:04:01.473
You provoked him.

1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:05.088
Sure, I was only dancing with you.

1:04:05.130 --> 1:04:08.378
And don't be wearing those
yokes if you don't want a poke.

1:04:08.420 --> 1:04:11.803
You might as well put a sign
on it that says, Enter here.

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:17.240
Can you even get a girlfriend
that you don't have to rape?

1:04:19.960 --> 1:04:20.960
Rarely.

1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:24.810
So you're throbbing then?

1:04:30.577 --> 1:04:33.538
The only cure for pain is pleasure.

1:04:33.580 --> 1:04:34.580
Right.

1:04:36.750 --> 1:04:39.118
Are you afraid you won't be able to?

1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:41.418
Hey, don't be fucking
daring me now, woman.

1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:42.860
I could get up on the whinns.

1:04:45.259 --> 1:04:48.248
What about you now, Goldilocks?

1:04:48.290 --> 1:04:49.533
Are you the quiet type?

1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:54.393
Put the knife down, and you'll see.

1:04:56.182 --> 1:05:00.893
Such fine words, for such fine women.

1:05:03.729 --> 1:05:05.083
What I won't do to you now.

1:05:06.780 --> 1:05:08.481
Move and I'll cut your fucking throat!

1:05:08.523 --> 1:05:10.333
Yous fucking whores.

1:05:13.570 --> 1:05:14.570
Put those on him.

1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:19.577
So that's your thing, is it?

1:05:19.619 --> 1:05:21.148
You're a rapist and a pervert.

1:05:21.190 --> 1:05:24.133
Oh, I'm plenty more things besides.

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:27.111
He's fucking high.

1:05:27.153 --> 1:05:29.113
No, I'm low. I'm down in
the earth with the weeds.

1:05:33.630 --> 1:05:34.630
Put that on him.

1:05:44.490 --> 1:05:45.958
We're going for a walk.

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.568
You're gonna show us the way out of here.

1:05:48.610 --> 1:05:50.812
I thought we were making love.

1:05:50.854 --> 1:05:53.021
But now, we're making war.

1:05:56.910 --> 1:05:57.910
Check his pockets.

1:06:03.323 --> 1:06:05.402
Steevy, check in.

1:06:05.444 --> 1:06:06.894
Is that your asshole uncle?

1:06:07.810 --> 1:06:09.533
Steevy can't talk right now.

1:06:12.690 --> 1:06:14.278
Did you kill him?

1:06:14.320 --> 1:06:17.208
No, he's going to rot in jail,

1:06:17.250 --> 1:06:19.253
just like you and your inbred brother.

1:06:21.170 --> 1:06:22.170
Is that so?

1:06:23.689 --> 1:06:26.838
You don't believe me.
Maybe I'll make him squeal.

1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:28.730
That's what you like, isn't it? Pain.

1:06:30.526 --> 1:06:32.226
And what about your friend, huh?

1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:34.640
Lisa.

1:06:35.750 --> 1:06:36.903
She's here with us.

1:06:37.950 --> 1:06:39.283
Do you want her to suffer?

1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:42.360
You're gonna do what you want.

1:06:43.380 --> 1:06:44.680
There's nothing I can say.

1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:48.288
But if you think that
there's something worse

1:06:48.330 --> 1:06:52.628
than getting your pet
animal to kill my husband,

1:06:52.670 --> 1:06:55.693
my friend, to try and rape me,

1:06:56.770 --> 1:06:57.770
then think again.

1:07:00.659 --> 1:07:04.877
There's always a fate worse
than death. I promise you.

1:07:06.020 --> 1:07:07.920
Then I guess we're on the same page.

1:07:09.380 --> 1:07:12.447
These radios don't have much
range, so you're close by.

1:07:13.610 --> 1:07:15.653
I'm going to leave you a parting gift.

1:07:17.890 --> 1:07:19.883
Stay the fuck away from us.

1:07:23.794 --> 1:07:26.044
Steevy, you fucking cunt.

1:07:29.910 --> 1:07:31.418
Was that wise?

1:07:31.460 --> 1:07:33.758
No, it fucking wasn't.

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:36.700
When that whore's mad, he makes
me look like an altar boy.

1:07:38.050 --> 1:07:40.550
You're making a fine mess
of this now, Brown Bear.

1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:42.720
Wait outside.

1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:46.720
Move.

1:07:58.820 --> 1:08:01.548
Sure, I wasn't actually gonna hurt you.

1:08:01.590 --> 1:08:03.047
This is only messing gone wrong.

1:08:04.817 --> 1:08:07.874
No, I heard what you
said to the other fella.

1:08:07.916 --> 1:08:09.818
The bull, you called him.

1:08:09.860 --> 1:08:11.310
The things you were gonna do.

1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:15.443
You're sick. And you're twisted.

1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:17.958
Yous are fierce fucking wily

1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:19.648
when it comes to fake sleeping.

1:08:19.690 --> 1:08:21.638
I'll tell you, only a spider or a snake

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:23.188
would seem that dead.

1:08:23.230 --> 1:08:25.348
But they'd be watching, and listening,

1:08:25.390 --> 1:08:27.551
hatching their own fucking
schemes to eat you alive.

1:08:27.593 --> 1:08:29.438
Stop talking.

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:31.257
So don't show you the way then?

1:08:32.713 --> 1:08:33.963
What is wrong with you?

1:08:35.090 --> 1:08:37.368
You know, I can take
the skin off a beast

1:08:37.410 --> 1:08:39.488
in five minutes with the blunt knife,

1:08:39.530 --> 1:08:41.293
and them hides is tougher than us.

1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:44.763
So just imagine what I'd do with you.

1:08:48.410 --> 1:08:50.488
Don't be scared now. I like women.

1:08:50.530 --> 1:08:53.198
I like yous more than
anything else in the world.

1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:56.498
Look, maybe, maybe we got
off on the wrong foot.

1:08:56.540 --> 1:08:59.388
Who's to say a few magic
mushrooms and we're all fine?

1:08:59.430 --> 1:09:01.493
Rosy in the fucking garden.

1:09:11.340 --> 1:09:13.263
Don't tell me you started a fire.

1:09:15.553 --> 1:09:18.088
Oh, you're going to be riling a monster

1:09:18.130 --> 1:09:19.530
you don't want to be riding.

1:09:20.513 --> 1:09:21.726
If it was a gift you wanted to get him,

1:09:21.750 --> 1:09:23.533
he's awful fond of badgers.

1:09:24.550 --> 1:09:26.258
What have you taken?

1:09:26.300 --> 1:09:28.438
All I'll tell you is this is the worst

1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:30.023
fucking escape I've ever seen.

1:09:31.854 --> 1:09:33.912
He's fucking nuts.

1:09:33.954 --> 1:09:35.537
Do you like nuts?

1:09:36.890 --> 1:09:37.890
Which way?

1:09:39.342 --> 1:09:40.342
Uh.

1:09:42.250 --> 1:09:44.478
If you're lying, you're going to die

1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:46.167
in a very painful way.

1:09:48.014 --> 1:09:50.790
Ho, you're getting a
taste for this, you know.

1:11:23.762 --> 1:11:25.562
Are you burning something at home?

1:11:27.090 --> 1:11:28.090
Where are you?

1:11:29.690 --> 1:11:32.558
I'm in Spain sunbathing.
Where do you think?

1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:33.603
Black sheep is dead.

1:11:36.316 --> 1:11:39.313
Steevy killed two of them,
and the other two have Steevy.

1:11:41.750 --> 1:11:43.193
You're fucking joking me.

1:11:44.500 --> 1:11:45.878
Yeah, I'm joking.

1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:46.988
The shed is on fire.

1:11:47.030 --> 1:11:49.228
And that fucking whore's cunt Steevy

1:11:49.270 --> 1:11:51.588
has fucked everything
up from here to China.

1:11:51.630 --> 1:11:52.983
Some fucking joke.

1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:55.456
If you didn't pass them on the low road,

1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:57.318
they're coming out this way.

1:11:57.360 --> 1:12:00.328
I'll wait here. They'll
be two sitting ducks.

1:12:00.370 --> 1:12:02.333
Yeah, well, I be downwind of you.

1:12:02.375 --> 1:12:03.953
So don't fucking shoot me as well.

1:12:09.410 --> 1:12:11.864
Pair of fucking gobshites.

1:12:21.220 --> 1:12:22.497
Hurts?

1:12:22.539 --> 1:12:23.608
Good.

1:12:23.650 --> 1:12:24.441
Prick.

1:12:24.483 --> 1:12:25.696
Hope you don't have a real dog.

1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:28.008
That's all I'm fucking saying.

1:12:28.050 --> 1:12:31.760
I'd say you have, a
chihuahua or a shih tzu.

1:12:31.802 --> 1:12:32.661
Shut the fuck up.

1:12:32.703 --> 1:12:35.048
Have you ever seen the faces on them.

1:12:35.090 --> 1:12:37.440
How in the world would
you buy a dog like that?

1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:41.118
Have you ever been diagnosed
with a mental illness?

1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:42.328
Like what?

1:12:42.370 --> 1:12:43.423
Schizophrenia.

1:12:45.397 --> 1:12:47.716
Is that the one where
you're like loads of fellas.

1:12:47.758 --> 1:12:49.904
That'd be great, wouldn't it?

1:12:49.946 --> 1:12:53.058
You know, most people wanna
be Batman or Superman.

1:12:53.100 --> 1:12:55.728
I don't like wearing rubber.
You know what I'm saying.

1:12:55.770 --> 1:12:57.023
Fucking disgusting.

1:12:58.662 --> 1:13:00.558
A woman scorned, huh?

1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:01.926
I guess you have a right to be mad, sure.

1:13:01.950 --> 1:13:03.800
That was a fierce thing done to yous.

1:13:06.010 --> 1:13:08.393
I'm ashamed. Black is me heart.

1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:10.760
Go on so.

1:13:11.949 --> 1:13:12.949
Cut me throat.

1:13:14.030 --> 1:13:17.748
I tell you, murder's not
so bad, but people are.

1:13:17.790 --> 1:13:21.128
They be telling you one thing,
looking at you, you're great,

1:13:21.170 --> 1:13:22.229
and then pulling your
guts out at the same time.

1:13:22.253 --> 1:13:23.993
Back the fuck off.

1:13:25.010 --> 1:13:27.898
Did you ever think that
maybe you deserve it,

1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:30.438
that you're the worst of them all?

1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:33.383
All the time. Geez, I know
I'm a pure fucking cunt.

1:13:34.706 --> 1:13:39.479
But at the same time,
amn't I helping yous now.

1:13:39.521 --> 1:13:43.379
You better be, or I swear.

1:13:44.310 --> 1:13:45.918
That's not swearing, woman.

1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:47.893
You're in the fucking sticks now.

1:13:48.890 --> 1:13:49.890
Just move.

1:14:42.165 --> 1:14:44.332
I hoped you'd be better.

1:14:46.771 --> 1:14:49.049
But you're just the same as them all.

1:14:49.091 --> 1:14:51.341
A horsefly'd sting me more.

1:14:52.737 --> 1:14:54.593
But I'm glad you're not dead, though.

1:14:55.905 --> 1:14:57.755
There'd be no fun in that.

1:14:57.797 --> 1:14:59.803
Well I'll show you now, a real knife.

1:15:22.950 --> 1:15:24.973
Some stings are worse than others.

1:15:26.410 --> 1:15:29.898
My father was a hunter, and my uncles.

1:15:29.940 --> 1:15:31.778
Aim for the body and not the head.

1:15:31.820 --> 1:15:33.673
Don't spoil your trophy, they'd say.

1:15:35.380 --> 1:15:38.193
I was afraid you'd be better. I was wrong.

1:15:41.530 --> 1:15:42.968
Nice knife.

1:15:43.010 --> 1:15:45.473
Friends, dead or alive?

1:15:46.437 --> 1:15:47.437
Dead.

1:15:48.900 --> 1:15:50.458
Really?

1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:53.488
If you wing a bird, you
put it out of its misery.

1:15:53.530 --> 1:15:54.530
Hunter's code.

1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:24.766
You know what actually?

1:16:24.808 --> 1:16:26.226
That was something, your husband did,

1:16:26.250 --> 1:16:27.873
pulling that yoke from his leg.

1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:30.740
Do you think he knew he was gonna die?

1:16:32.459 --> 1:16:34.908
Like, do yous know that
you're going to die?

1:16:34.950 --> 1:16:36.506
I thought that leash
would keep you quiet,

1:16:36.530 --> 1:16:38.143
but you obviously like the pain.

1:16:39.100 --> 1:16:41.078
Pain's just like fucking life.

1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:43.958
After a while, you don't
fucking feel it anymore.

1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:45.758
Don't be so sure.

1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:47.758
Would you torture me, would you?

1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:49.498
I suppose you are in a way.

1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:51.068
Do you like it?

1:16:51.110 --> 1:16:52.698
Oh my God.

1:16:52.740 --> 1:16:55.763
I'm always thinking that
civilization is a fine line.

1:16:57.100 --> 1:16:58.988
We have this yoke on the farm, a pear.

1:16:59.030 --> 1:17:02.580
You know, not the fruit
now, but this metal thing.

1:17:02.622 --> 1:17:03.806
And in the Spanish Inquisition,

1:17:03.830 --> 1:17:06.121
they used to push it right up inside you.

1:17:06.163 --> 1:17:07.868
And there was a handle on it for winding,

1:17:07.910 --> 1:17:10.603
and out it comes, like a flower.

1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:13.628
We should've fucking gagged you.

1:17:13.670 --> 1:17:15.898
You're not friendly at all.

1:17:15.940 --> 1:17:18.158
We don't like psychos.

1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:21.422
Ah, listen, girls. Are yous
all on the blob or what?

1:17:21.464 --> 1:17:24.848
We're out here in the wild,
having a nature experience.

1:17:24.890 --> 1:17:27.723
And God. God is nature.

1:17:28.819 --> 1:17:30.787
No, no what I was thinking was,

1:17:32.350 --> 1:17:34.550
maybe it wasn't brave
what your husband did.

1:17:35.550 --> 1:17:37.203
Maybe you were a bad wife.

1:17:38.750 --> 1:17:40.258
And he says to himself,

1:17:40.300 --> 1:17:42.903
I'd rather die here than live with you.

1:17:49.574 --> 1:17:51.076
Save it, you prick.

1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:00.598
Sh.

1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:01.640
Listen.

1:18:41.893 --> 1:18:42.893
Susan.

1:19:05.684 --> 1:19:06.886
Shit.

1:19:44.550 --> 1:19:45.550
Brownie.

1:19:50.210 --> 1:19:52.217
It's great to finally see you alone.

1:19:53.900 --> 1:19:54.900
Did she die, yeah?

1:19:55.790 --> 1:19:58.183
This is fucked, now
everybody's fucking dying.

1:19:59.715 --> 1:20:03.478
But I can save you, you know.
You have to be smart now.

1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:07.038
You're not in your office
anymore. You're in mine.

1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:09.113
And in my office, things is different.

1:20:10.010 --> 1:20:12.508
Number one thing, I'm the boss.

1:20:12.550 --> 1:20:14.573
Not those lads, me.

1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:18.003
And there'd be no fucking working either.

1:20:19.766 --> 1:20:22.668
Unless, unless you call riding working,

1:20:22.710 --> 1:20:24.553
which I suppose it is.

1:20:27.270 --> 1:20:29.908
I'll make you an offer, Brownie babes.

1:20:29.950 --> 1:20:33.917
If you marry me, I won't fight you.

1:20:38.828 --> 1:20:42.308
Remember, you chased here after me.

1:20:42.350 --> 1:20:44.658
You don't see the
gazelle chasing the lion,

1:20:44.700 --> 1:20:46.848
or the penguin after
the Great White, do you?

1:20:46.890 --> 1:20:47.933
No, you don't.

1:20:48.803 --> 1:20:51.248
So don't fucking con yourself, woman.

1:20:51.290 --> 1:20:53.733
It's marriage or death.

1:21:06.409 --> 1:21:07.742
Steevy.

1:21:12.764 --> 1:21:15.888
About fucking time for yous.

1:21:15.930 --> 1:21:17.148
I have the bitch now.

1:21:17.190 --> 1:21:19.230
Do you have any idea what
the whole group of them...

1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:27.773
Don't move, you.

1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:48.803
I told you to mind the farm.

1:21:49.970 --> 1:21:52.513
I told you to keep an eye on the guests.

1:21:53.670 --> 1:21:56.033
A thousand fucking times, I told you.

1:21:57.130 --> 1:21:58.130
Don't.

1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:01.108
I'm shot in the guts.

1:22:01.150 --> 1:22:02.650
It's gone in the head you are.

1:22:08.456 --> 1:22:10.015
I wanna tell you something.

1:22:10.057 --> 1:22:11.173
Listen to me.

1:22:12.740 --> 1:22:14.440
You're not my nephew from Timahoe.

1:22:16.351 --> 1:22:18.243
Your mother was a guest at the farm.

1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:20.320
My guest.

1:22:21.530 --> 1:22:22.723
And when you dropped out,

1:22:22.765 --> 1:22:25.215
there was a bucket of cold
water waiting for you.

1:22:26.684 --> 1:22:29.495
But you, you never made a sound.

1:22:29.537 --> 1:22:31.310
You didn't cry or nothing.

1:22:33.237 --> 1:22:35.568
And that was the only time that you were

1:22:35.610 --> 1:22:37.633
never a pain in my fucking hole.

1:22:40.440 --> 1:22:42.373
You gone too far this time, Steevy.

1:22:43.510 --> 1:22:44.810
There's no going back now.

1:22:46.561 --> 1:22:47.561
You're done.

1:22:56.047 --> 1:22:58.947
Bet you never thought this is
how you day'd turn out, huh?

1:23:00.033 --> 1:23:01.533
Down here amongst the animals.

1:23:04.375 --> 1:23:05.375
There's two choices.

1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:09.573
We can go back to the
farm, talk about your life.

1:23:10.883 --> 1:23:12.708
Or I can kill you here, now.

1:23:12.750 --> 1:23:13.750
Go to hell.

1:23:15.550 --> 1:23:18.450
Look around. Where do you
think you are, a camping site?

1:23:19.580 --> 1:23:23.778
You think aiming your gun
makes you scary? It doesn't.

1:23:23.820 --> 1:23:25.648
I've faced worse.

1:23:25.690 --> 1:23:28.113
So kill me. I don't care.

1:23:30.404 --> 1:23:32.504
I seen a photograph of you on the phone.

1:23:33.460 --> 1:23:36.983
Bald head and a tube
coming outta your nose.

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:39.280
Cancer, was it?

1:23:40.627 --> 1:23:44.310
Well, if you think that's the
most painful thing in life,

1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:47.130
I'm afraid you're underestimating it.

1:23:48.950 --> 1:23:50.150
I'm not scared of you.

1:23:51.503 --> 1:23:53.178
I warned you.

1:23:53.220 --> 1:23:55.408
I put up the signs, no
trespassing, but you still had

1:23:55.450 --> 1:23:58.518
to walk onto my fucking
land, didn't you, huh?

1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:03.120
You could have let us go,
like a normal, civilized person.

1:24:03.162 --> 1:24:05.578
Civilization's where you live.

1:24:05.620 --> 1:24:09.248
Where I live, people are worse than you.

1:24:09.290 --> 1:24:12.390
The city eats you alive. Slowly.

1:24:20.770 --> 1:24:23.223
Daddy. Are you my daddy, are you?

1:24:24.504 --> 1:24:26.098
It's great to fucking meet you, Daddy.

1:24:33.050 --> 1:24:34.763
Who's the fucking daddy now, huh?

1:25:24.190 --> 1:25:25.190
You came back.

1:25:26.440 --> 1:25:27.783
Sorry I left.

1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:30.480
Are you okay?

1:25:32.430 --> 1:25:33.430
Yeah.

1:25:35.401 --> 1:25:36.401
Alive.

1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.833
I wanna get a video.

1:27:37.893 --> 1:27:39.560
Hey.

1:27:39.602 --> 1:27:40.605
Gorgeous.

1:27:40.647 --> 1:27:42.122
Another one.
