00:05.060 --> 00:07.290
So, the lowest level of the globe theater

00:07.360 --> 00:09.020
was reserved for "the groundlings"

00:09.090 --> 00:11.630
who were the lower class people
who came out to enjoy...

00:11.700 --> 00:13.830
You guys!
I'm sorry I'm late,

00:13.900 --> 00:17.900
but my mom slammed my hand
in the car door!!!

00:17.970 --> 00:21.840
Ahhhhh!!!

00:24.640 --> 00:29.440
April fools!!!

00:29.510 --> 00:31.380
Yeah!

00:31.450 --> 00:35.150
- What are you, five years old?
- Really.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.820
But today's April fools day.

00:37.890 --> 00:39.050
We really don't care.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.020
April fools day is kinda
for, y'know, little kids.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.760
That's how we all feel.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.930
But this school is so full
of creative people,

00:51.000 --> 00:54.770
I thought for sure April fools
day would be a big deal here.

00:54.840 --> 00:55.970
Well, it's not!

00:56.040 --> 00:57.210
Okay, "tori"?

00:57.270 --> 01:00.510
So just shut your face
and let mister belding teach!

01:00.580 --> 01:04.410
Thank you, Zack.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.280
Now, as screech was saying,

01:06.350 --> 01:12.290
a world without pants is like a donut...

01:12.360 --> 01:16.760
Yes! Yes.
Yes.

01:16.830 --> 01:20.660
Oh c'mon.
No one here is into April fools?

01:20.730 --> 01:24.470
Oh! Okay!

01:28.100 --> 01:30.570
Tori, I'm sorry Mr. belding
took your purse.

01:30.640 --> 01:37.150
And no, we don't celebrate
April fools day here.

01:37.210 --> 01:39.810
Now, who else has a question?

01:39.880 --> 01:40.850
Andre.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.650
I have a front loading washing machine

01:42.720 --> 01:45.420
and lately, I've noticed that my
washer isn't draining properly,

01:45.490 --> 01:49.090
and it leaves my clothes both wet and damp.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.190
Uh, what should I do?

01:51.260 --> 01:53.090
Robbie, what's the answer?

01:53.160 --> 01:55.330
First, rotate the drum by hand

01:55.400 --> 01:57.370
and check for any scraping
of the outer tub.

01:57.430 --> 02:00.440
Then move the open end
of the whirly-doink up and down

02:00.500 --> 02:02.400
while moving the pump rod
in a circular motion,

02:02.470 --> 02:04.140
while making sure that there's less

02:04.210 --> 02:06.010
than one quarter-inch
of movement...

02:06.080 --> 02:08.380
So, at Hollywood arts,
everybody justgnores the fact

02:08.449 --> 02:10.810
that today is April fools day.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.480
- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

02:12.550 --> 02:13.410
Yeah, we ignore it.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.350
Wait... did you just say you
wanted a face full of trumpet?

02:16.420 --> 02:18.550
What do you mean face full of...

02:31.300 --> 02:33.870
Wait, was that the bell?

02:35.370 --> 02:38.810
Ooo, there's the bell.

02:47.820 --> 02:52.820
- Hey girlie.
- What?

Sinjin...

04:08.560 --> 04:12.220
Hello, Tori.

04:12.290 --> 04:14.530
How can I help you today?

04:14.530 --> 04:16.459
Well, I was just in Sikowitz's class,

04:16.529 --> 04:18.500
and everybody told me
that no one at Hollywood arts

04:18.570 --> 04:20.600
does anything fun for April fools day,

04:20.670 --> 04:24.540
- and I just think that we...
- Shhhhhh.

04:24.610 --> 04:27.970
Now now, Tori...
If you're gonna be my lady,

04:28.040 --> 04:33.080
you need to do a lot less talkin'.

04:33.150 --> 04:38.280
- I'm not gonna be your lady.
- Heh heh heh.

04:38.350 --> 04:42.290
We'll see about that.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.120
Tori! Tori! Did ya hear?
Did ya hear the news?!

04:45.190 --> 04:46.690
- What, what happened?!
- It's war!

04:46.760 --> 04:48.830
It's war, Tori!
It's war!

04:48.900 --> 04:50.900
Is it Switzerland?!

04:50.970 --> 04:52.430
Will you forget about the war?!

04:52.500 --> 04:55.070
We're gonna have a pop quiz!

04:55.140 --> 04:58.040
- But you just said...
- It's true I tell ya!

04:58.110 --> 05:02.310
I just heard it from two boys
in the bathroom! At the urinal.

05:02.380 --> 05:06.550
We're gonna have a pop quiz!
A pop quiz is goin' down, Tori!

05:06.610 --> 05:10.620
Oh my God!
I hate pop quizzes!

05:10.680 --> 05:13.890
How can you think about a pop
quiz when we're at war?!

05:13.950 --> 05:18.090
It's war, Tori!
It's war!!

05:18.160 --> 05:21.660

Oh tofu, are you all right?

06:12.250 --> 06:18.520
Did she hurt you?
She tried to, didn't she?

06:18.590 --> 06:21.920
It's awful hot in here.
I better open a window.

06:29.060 --> 06:36.030
Oh no! Tofu!
Oh! Oh!! Oh!

06:38.610 --> 06:42.470
Concussion!

07:00.530 --> 07:03.630
Oh my goodness, tofu!

07:03.700 --> 07:09.970
Well, I have a feeling we're not in
the Hollywood arts bathroom anymore.

07:10.040 --> 07:15.770
Oh no wait, we are, it's just in color.

07:21.550 --> 07:26.550
- Well, hello.
- Hello, if you please.

07:26.620 --> 07:30.260
Are you a good witch, or a sandwich?

07:30.320 --> 07:34.430
Who, me? Well, I'm neither
a witch, nor a snack.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.500
You're talkin' some crazy chiz.

07:38.570 --> 07:46.510
Well, you do have the Ruby cell phone.

07:46.570 --> 07:48.310
Oh my goodness!

07:48.380 --> 07:50.740
Well, this phone is beautiful!

07:50.810 --> 07:56.010
Were all my contacts transferred?

07:58.480 --> 08:02.920
Who took my Ruby cell phone?
Was it you?

08:02.990 --> 08:05.920
Oh, I didn't mean to.
Here, you can have it back.

08:05.990 --> 08:11.360
- Good, give it.
Dee-ahh-deeahh-dee-ahh-dee-ahh!

08:11.430 --> 08:12.700
Curses!

08:12.770 --> 08:15.170
I'll never be able to get
that Ruby cell phone

08:15.240 --> 08:17.600
as long as it's April fools day!

08:17.670 --> 08:18.670
Y'know, speaking of that,

08:18.740 --> 08:20.840
are we really not gonna do
anything for April fools day?

08:20.910 --> 08:25.740
Silence!!!
I'll get you, my pretty.

08:25.810 --> 08:29.210
And your little fish, too!

08:29.280 --> 08:30.850
Oh be gone.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.490
You have no powers in this restroom.

08:34.559 --> 08:40.360
The witch sneers at Dorothy, then exits.

08:43.860 --> 08:46.900
Oh my...

08:46.970 --> 08:50.800
She spoke her stage directions.

08:50.870 --> 08:53.810
What am I s'posed to do now?

08:53.870 --> 09:02.110
Well, you are in a restroom.
You could wazz.

09:02.180 --> 09:04.380
Tofu too?

09:04.450 --> 09:07.890
Tofu too.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.760
Oh tofu.

09:18.830 --> 09:24.170
I'm scared and frightened and afraid.

09:24.240 --> 09:29.140
Oh my goodness, those are all synonyms.

09:29.210 --> 09:32.110
- Don't be scared, Cat.
- Robbie! Who are you?!

09:32.180 --> 09:36.580
- Robbie.
- Oh hiiii Robbie!

09:38.420 --> 09:43.590
- We're here to help you.
- Oh my!

09:46.730 --> 09:49.330
Put 'em up!
Put 'em up!

09:49.400 --> 09:51.260
- Put what up?
- Your socks... they fell down

09:51.330 --> 09:56.500
- put 'em up!
- Yes sir!

09:56.570 --> 09:58.370
Now, how can we help you, Cat?

09:58.440 --> 10:00.740
I just wanna get back to class.

10:00.810 --> 10:01.710
Well that's easy.

10:01.780 --> 10:05.240
First, ya just punch Robbie
right in the face.

10:05.310 --> 10:10.380
Wait, was that in the movie?
'Cause I don't remember getting p...

10:13.120 --> 10:14.750
- Hey Leon... Leon...
- Hey, what's up?

10:14.820 --> 10:16.350
You're late for the next scene.

10:16.420 --> 10:19.190
- I'm late?
- Yes. Victoria's already started acting.

10:19.260 --> 10:21.760
Oh man! Later y'all.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.560
Sorry I'm late.

10:24.630 --> 10:27.730
I was in the girls' bathroom
doin' a wizard of oz bit.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.300
Oh it's okay.
Hey, where's our food?

10:30.370 --> 10:31.440
Oh, here it comes.

10:35.380 --> 10:40.380
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.820
- Man, I am so hungry.
- Me too.

10:45.890 --> 10:49.190
Hey, can we get a couple
of feeding children over here?

10:49.260 --> 10:54.490
Two feeding children at table sixteen.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.500
Tori! Tori!
I'm running in with big news! Tori!

11:04.570 --> 11:05.440
It's him!

11:09.540 --> 11:10.840
What's the big news?!

11:10.910 --> 11:12.680
The Beverly hills volcano
is about to erupt!!!

11:12.750 --> 11:13.480
What?!

11:13.550 --> 11:14.210
- In three-and-a-half minutes,

11:14.280 --> 11:16.820
this whole school is gonna
be covered with hot lava!

11:16.880 --> 11:19.080
- We only have
three-and-a-half minutes?

11:19.150 --> 11:21.620
The same amount of time
as a commercial break.

11:21.690 --> 11:26.020
- Well... what do we do?!
- I say we kiss!

11:26.090 --> 11:28.490
- Okay, c'mere.
- Not you!

11:28.560 --> 11:30.830
You.
Kiss me, Tori.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.930
I want my last
three-and-a-half minutes

11:33.000 --> 11:37.300
to be spent with my face
smushed against your face!

11:37.370 --> 11:40.270
Are there any other ideas?

11:40.340 --> 11:43.140
Tori, please!

11:43.210 --> 11:46.880
All right.

11:48.650 --> 11:51.580
Stay tuned for the second
half of Victorious.

11:51.650 --> 11:54.300
Or don't.
I get paid either way.

11:58.690 --> 12:03.360
And now, we continue with the
exciting second half of Victorious.

12:03.430 --> 12:05.090
Press play.

12:05.690 --> 12:07.900
Tori! Andre!
Have you heard?!

12:07.960 --> 12:09.660
- Have ya heard the news?!
- Later!!!

12:09.730 --> 12:10.330
What news?!

12:10.400 --> 12:13.630
I already told you! The Beverly hills
volcano is about to erupt, now kiss me!

12:13.700 --> 12:15.970
- No. No, the new news!
- What new news?!

12:16.040 --> 12:19.870
The Beverly hills volcano has
retired and moved to Florida.

12:19.940 --> 12:23.980
So it's probably not gonna spew
hot lava all over Hollywood arts.

12:24.050 --> 12:26.010
- Yay.
- Yay.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.580
Wait! I just heard we're about to
be attacked by killer butterflies!

12:30.650 --> 12:33.490
- No.
- Wait!

12:33.560 --> 12:36.620
Sinjin has two big jugs
of anti-butterfly spray!

12:36.690 --> 12:41.930
- Yay.
- But I drank them.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.470
Wait! I'm not gonna eat this apple,
so you guys can all share it!

12:46.800 --> 12:47.570
Wait!

12:47.640 --> 12:50.440
I just got a text that says:
"Apples make your hair fall out!"

12:50.510 --> 12:52.970
No.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.880
What's done is done.

13:05.890 --> 13:08.090
Well, hey there Tori.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.590
Hey.

13:09.660 --> 13:13.660
Oh, why the sad boo boo face?

13:13.730 --> 13:16.730
I guess I was just really looking
forward to April fools day,

13:16.800 --> 13:20.270
and I'm disappointed
that everyone ignores it.

13:20.340 --> 13:24.910
Well, then I guess somebody's
gonna have to get tickled.

13:24.970 --> 13:28.810
No, don't.
I'm not in the mood.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.950
- Uh-oh.
It's the tickle bunny twins!

13:32.010 --> 13:35.350
A'tikka tikka tikka tikka tikka!
A'tikka tikka tikka tikka tikka

13:35.420 --> 13:39.720
tikka tikka!

13:45.360 --> 13:49.260
I just feel like April fools
day should be different.

13:49.330 --> 13:55.800
Well, too bad, Tori. It's just a
regular day here at Hollywood arts.

13:55.870 --> 13:58.640
Jade! Jade! You're late...
Go to the janitor's closet.

13:58.710 --> 13:59.770
Ooo, right!

14:06.580 --> 14:08.450
Wait, what's happening
in the janitor's closet?

14:08.520 --> 14:11.690
Just make sure you're there
in the next sixty seconds.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.120
Being attacked!

14:13.190 --> 14:14.260
Ahhhh!

14:14.320 --> 14:16.620
Great crustaceans!

14:16.690 --> 14:21.460
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

14:21.530 --> 14:28.900
Oh God.
Get it off!

14:33.140 --> 14:36.710
Hurry!

14:44.890 --> 14:50.690
- Hey, Spencer.
- 'Sup Tori?

14:50.760 --> 14:54.300
Get ready to match the stars!

14:54.360 --> 14:55.430
All right!

14:55.500 --> 15:01.000
We're here with our next
contestant, Tori Vega.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.640
Where ya from, Tori?

15:03.710 --> 15:05.310
Uh, I live in the Hollywood hills.

15:05.370 --> 15:10.580
Wonderful. And are ya ready to
go for the big money match?

15:10.650 --> 15:11.310
Well, okay.

15:11.380 --> 15:12.110
Good.

15:12.180 --> 15:13.950
Now, you know how our game is played.

15:14.020 --> 15:14.720
Uh, yes.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.520
You read a sentence, with a missing word,

15:16.590 --> 15:18.220
and then I have to fill in the blank.

15:18.290 --> 15:20.990
Right. And if you match at least
one of our panelists' answers,

15:21.060 --> 15:24.560
you win five thousand dollars.

15:27.300 --> 15:31.070
Wait. What happens
if I don't match a panelist?

15:31.130 --> 15:34.500
- You'll see.
- Huh?

15:34.570 --> 15:36.970
And your question is:

15:37.040 --> 15:42.280
- "Dumb Debbie was so dumb..."
- How dumb was she?

15:42.350 --> 15:43.580
"She was so dumb,

15:43.650 --> 15:48.820
"she didn't realize that April first was April fools blank."

15:48.890 --> 15:54.490
- Okay. I've got a good word.
- Bring it.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.860
Okay, Tori.

15:55.930 --> 15:57.930
"Dumb Debbie was so dumb,

15:57.990 --> 16:02.660
"she didn't realize that April
first was April fools..."

16:02.730 --> 16:07.800
- Day.
- "Day"...

16:07.870 --> 16:10.470
Hmmm... "Day".

16:10.540 --> 16:13.070
Well, let's see if you match anybody.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.070
Andre?

16:14.140 --> 16:17.280
Roses are red, storm clouds are gray,

16:17.350 --> 16:21.550
Debbie's so dumb, she didn't
realize it was April fools...

16:21.620 --> 16:23.750
...Lobster.

16:28.160 --> 16:33.160
What's the lobster...
Ahhh! Wait...

16:38.670 --> 16:42.240
All right, now get up.

16:42.310 --> 16:44.870
Jade, what's your answer?

16:44.870 --> 16:47.810
I figured she was so dumb,

16:47.880 --> 16:54.350
she thought April first was April fools...
...Berry.

16:54.350 --> 16:55.920
That's a thing, right?

16:55.990 --> 16:58.620
April fools Berry, that's a thing.

16:58.690 --> 17:03.590
Oh, you're a thing.
A foul beast of a thing!

17:03.660 --> 17:05.329
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

17:05.390 --> 17:08.230
It's not my fault
that she said Berry... wait.

17:08.300 --> 17:11.599
But she said Berry.

17:15.440 --> 17:19.510
- All right, upsee-daisy.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.710
- Robbie...?
- Yesss?

17:21.780 --> 17:22.740
Yesss, what is it Sikowitz?

17:22.810 --> 17:23.839
Dumb Debbie was so dumb,

17:23.910 --> 17:27.109
she didn't realize that a April
first was April fools...

17:27.119 --> 17:29.520
"Foot".

17:29.590 --> 17:33.890
Oh shut up you people, I was on Broadway.

17:33.890 --> 17:35.390
Cat, it's your turn.

17:35.460 --> 17:38.090
Wait, the lobster forgot to push Tori down.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.730
Oh yes.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.860
Cat, why would you remind...

17:51.840 --> 17:56.040
Will you get up?

17:56.110 --> 17:57.710
Cat...

17:57.710 --> 17:59.180
Dumb Debbie was so dumb,

17:59.250 --> 18:02.650
she didn't realize that April
first was April fools blank.

18:02.720 --> 18:07.690
I said... "Blank".

18:07.690 --> 18:14.290
- Cat. I said blank.
- I love president Ford!

18:14.360 --> 18:18.000
We're not gonna bring out
the lobster for that one.

18:18.070 --> 18:19.230
Beck!

18:19.300 --> 18:21.270
Well, I'm sorry darlin', I'm starving,

18:21.340 --> 18:27.940

18:40.360 --> 18:42.390
Come on, Trina!

18:42.460 --> 18:49.230
Well... I said...
"Cut to the next scene".

18:49.300 --> 18:54.070
Awww, your stupid card

18:54.140 --> 18:56.500
You cost me five thousand dollars!

18:56.570 --> 19:00.010
But I want an oompa loompa nowwwww.

19:00.080 --> 19:05.850
- You can't have an oompa...
- Happy Birthday!

19:05.920 --> 19:10.720
- It's not my birthday.
- Touchdown!

19:10.790 --> 19:15.420
- There's no football game.
- Where's the beef?!

19:15.490 --> 19:18.390

19:18.460 --> 19:22.100
And it's April fools day!

19:22.160 --> 19:25.800

19:29.970 --> 19:33.940
