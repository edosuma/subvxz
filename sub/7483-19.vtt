00:07.541 --> 00:09.073
for engaging both mobile

00:09.075 --> 00:11.208

enemy targets.

00:11.210 --> 00:14.244
New capabilities include
enhanced supersonic speed

00:14.246 --> 00:17.113
and extended antiradar
frequency coverage.
WOMAN: All missile

Telemetry and

Now, that is
one beautiful sight.

I have a course deviation
anomaly.

00:49.408 --> 00:50.507
Engage backup
system.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.208
It's just
a hiccup.
90 degrees

00:52.210 --> 00:53.142
off course.
Manually
intervene

00:53.144 --> 00:54.543
and redirect.

00:54.545 --> 00:56.144
It's unusual.

What the hell?

01:01.383 --> 01:03.149
Break target lock.
The missile's

01:03.151 --> 01:05.684
not in sync with our systems.
Abort.

01:05.686 --> 01:06.484
Send destruct code now.

01:06.486 --> 01:07.351
(beeping)

01:07.353 --> 01:08.685
Missile's not accepting

01:08.687 --> 01:10.486
my signal.

01:10.488 --> 01:12.321
It's a civilian cabin cruiser.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.322
ADMIRAL:
Good God.

01:13.324 --> 01:14.523
Do something.

Top o' the morning to ya.

01:41.248 --> 01:43.248
You know what I got for ya.
I got you a wee gift.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.833
Yeah.

01:44.834 --> 01:46.417
A gift of good luck.
(chuckles)

01:46.419 --> 01:48.652
A little late for
St. Patrick's Day.
Yeah, but it's after the holiday

01:48.654 --> 01:50.754
so everything's 80% off.
Including

01:50.756 --> 01:51.788
the green beer?

01:51.790 --> 01:52.822
Yep. A little
time shift,

01:52.824 --> 01:54.757
you get much more bang
for your buck.

01:54.759 --> 01:57.226
Which is why I celebrate
Halloween on November 2,

01:57.228 --> 02:00.395
it's why I celebrate Christmas
on December 27.

02:00.397 --> 02:01.863
Valentine's Day?

02:01.865 --> 02:03.464
Don't ask.
Twice the flowers,

02:03.466 --> 02:05.199
twice the chocolate,

02:05.201 --> 02:07.334
quarter the price.
Did you get any leprechauns?

02:07.336 --> 02:08.802
Oh, I hope not.

02:08.804 --> 02:10.203
You got a thing
about leprechauns?

02:10.204 --> 02:11.603
No, I just saw the movie when I
was little, and I had nightmares

02:11.606 --> 02:13.606
for a year.
SAM: No, the Leprechaun

02:13.608 --> 02:15.174
wasn't so bad.
Chucky was much worse.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.608
Okay, well,

02:16.610 --> 02:17.959
I don't understand
why they make movies

02:17.960 --> 02:19.309
that traumatize kids like that
in the first place.

02:19.312 --> 02:20.444
DEEKS: Actually, according
to Bruno Bettelheim,

02:20.446 --> 02:22.312
the, uh, stories that involve

02:22.314 --> 02:23.646
the darkness of abandonment,
injury,

02:23.648 --> 02:25.481
and death allow children
to grapple

02:25.483 --> 02:27.182
with their own fears
in remote and symbolic ways

02:27.184 --> 02:29.167
that lead
to emotional growth

02:29.168 --> 02:31.151
and better prepare them
for adulthood.

02:32.121 --> 02:33.320
What?
Am I

02:33.322 --> 02:35.388
the only student
of psychology here?

02:35.390 --> 02:36.655
No, no, no. Thank you, Dr. Phil.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.189
But you
must admit

02:38.191 --> 02:41.392
a little evil leprechaun
running around,

02:41.394 --> 02:44.128
pretty disturbing, no?
ERIC: Aye, gather round.

02:44.130 --> 02:46.663
There's work to be done.
C'mere till I tell ya.

02:46.665 --> 02:48.197
Oh, Deeks.

02:48.199 --> 02:51.667
That was an awesome sale.

02:51.669 --> 02:53.335
I rest my case.

02:56.206 --> 02:59.407
Two hours ago,
defense contractor ADRD

02:59.409 --> 03:01.642
conducted a guided
missile test for the Navy.

03:01.644 --> 03:03.644
The intended destination
was this target vessel

03:03.646 --> 03:06.179
off the Channel Islands.
It was a perfect launch,

03:06.181 --> 03:09.282
and then the engineers found
themselves in quite a pickle.

03:09.284 --> 03:12.285
Engineers in a pickle.
That never ends well.

03:12.287 --> 03:13.319
Unfortunately,

03:13.321 --> 03:15.187
they lost control
of the missile,

03:15.189 --> 03:16.655
deviated
off course.

03:16.657 --> 03:17.756
Oh, man.
Was anybody

03:17.758 --> 03:19.157
on board?

03:19.159 --> 03:22.326
One of many
unanswered questions.

03:22.328 --> 03:25.329
We're concerned that
the missile's guidance system

03:25.331 --> 03:26.730
has been hacked.

03:26.732 --> 03:28.231
And if it has,

03:28.233 --> 03:30.366
we need to find out
if other Navy weapon systems

03:30.368 --> 03:31.734
have been compromised.

03:31.736 --> 03:33.736
No time to lose, Mr. Callen.

03:33.738 --> 03:36.572
Find who did this
and shut them down.

03:36.574 --> 03:38.774
Got it.
DEEKS: I wonder if it's
the same crew that hacked

03:38.776 --> 03:40.309
CENTCOM in January.
Mm.

03:40.310 --> 03:41.843
Those were only their Twitter
and YouTube accounts.

03:41.845 --> 03:43.344
These weapon systems
are extremely secure.

03:43.346 --> 03:44.578
CALLEN: Well,
the FBI thought that, too,

03:44.580 --> 03:46.246
until their terrorist
training scenarios

03:46.248 --> 03:47.580
were hacked last month.

03:47.582 --> 03:49.315
Why don't you find out
what mission control has to say.

03:49.317 --> 03:52.584
On it.
Got it.

03:52.586 --> 03:55.253
An off-course missile doesn't
score a direct hit like that

03:55.255 --> 03:57.321
unless someone wanted
to sink that boat.

03:57.323 --> 03:59.189
It's a Coast Guard case.

03:59.191 --> 04:01.491
Let's find out what they drag up
from the deep.

04:07.364 --> 04:10.231
(indistinct chatter)

04:10.233 --> 04:13.500
We've got Coast Guard and
Navy dive teams in the water.

04:13.502 --> 04:16.402
Any human remains?
Not yet.

04:16.404 --> 04:17.870
Let's hope it
stays that way.

04:17.872 --> 04:19.872
Cabin cover snaps
were in place.

04:19.874 --> 04:22.341
Good indicator
that nobody was on board.

04:22.343 --> 04:24.876
What kind of boat?
Phillips 32.

04:24.878 --> 04:27.345
Hundreds of them
in Southern California.

04:27.347 --> 04:28.979
Any registration
number?

04:28.981 --> 04:30.613
So far we've got a five

04:30.615 --> 04:33.315
and a "J."
In no particular order.

04:33.317 --> 04:36.717
I'd like to buy a vowel.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.486
Waterproof case.

04:48.361 --> 04:50.794
Wow.

04:50.796 --> 04:54.330
That is not what you expect
to find

04:54.332 --> 04:55.964
on a weekend pleasure craft.

04:55.966 --> 04:58.800
Fentanyl.

04:58.802 --> 05:01.402
It's 100 times more potent
than morphine.

05:01.404 --> 05:02.503
48 vials. That's got
to have a street value

05:02.505 --> 05:04.338
of 20 grand.

05:04.340 --> 05:06.940
Drug dealers?
They do have enemies.

05:06.942 --> 05:09.375
You know any drug dealers
that can hack a guided missile?

05:11.278 --> 05:12.878
You're the first to arrive.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.479
FBI and Homeland Security
are on their way.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.481
You found evidence
that your system was hacked?

05:16.483 --> 05:19.350
We have malicious code
embedded in our software.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.951
Did you figure out
how they got into your system?

05:20.953 --> 05:22.485
We have state-of-the-art
network security

05:22.487 --> 05:24.286
with advanced
encryption,

05:24.288 --> 05:27.289
multi-layer perimeter defense,
and intrusion detection.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.607
This could have been
an inside job.
Yeah.

05:28.608 --> 05:29.924
We're putting
every single workstation here

05:29.926 --> 05:32.393
under the microscope.
You have

05:32.394 --> 05:34.861
any disgruntled employees or
workers who were recently fired?
No.

05:34.864 --> 05:36.630
This is a good company.

05:36.632 --> 05:37.864
WOMAN:
Excuse me. Peter,

05:37.866 --> 05:40.733
we have something.

05:40.735 --> 05:43.869
Last week, Doug got an e-mail
inviting him

05:43.871 --> 05:46.338
to a military
R & D conference in Oahu.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.407
I-It looked legit.

05:48.408 --> 05:50.475
WOMAN:
But the conference
doesn't exist.

05:50.477 --> 05:52.376
The e-mail didn't come
from the Navy.

05:52.378 --> 05:55.045
I clicked on the agenda, which
seemed to be in PDF format.

05:55.047 --> 05:57.264
But actually
contained

05:57.265 --> 05:59.482
an executable file
that embedded software

05:59.484 --> 06:00.983
on his hard drive.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.618
Software that could steal
his username and password?

06:03.620 --> 06:04.785
Yes.
Giving
them access

06:04.787 --> 06:06.453
to all the weapon systems.

06:06.455 --> 06:08.455
That is the likely possibility.

06:08.457 --> 06:10.723
I wonder who else clicked
on that e-mail. Army, Navy,

06:10.725 --> 06:12.725
Air Force, Marines?

06:12.727 --> 06:16.328
Houston, we
got a problem.

06:27.306 --> 06:29.372
(indistinct chatter)

06:32.710 --> 06:34.776
G's in the wrong place.

06:34.778 --> 06:36.944
Yeah? Where do
you want me?
Not you. The letter.

06:36.946 --> 06:38.412
Uh-huh.
Should be

06:38.414 --> 06:39.880
before the numbers.
Got a "T."

06:41.683 --> 06:45.051
Hmm.

06:45.053 --> 06:46.419
We're still missing two numbers.

06:46.421 --> 06:47.052
Should be good enough
for the twins.

06:47.054 --> 06:49.054
(line ringing)

06:49.056 --> 06:51.389
Eric, Nell, do your thing.

06:51.391 --> 06:52.823
Oh, I'm working it.

06:52.825 --> 06:54.758
Searching the
DMV right now.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.426
Hey.

06:56.428 --> 06:58.694
Hey. What do you got there?

06:58.696 --> 07:01.029
Eh. A little, uh, snack,
in case we're hungry.

07:01.031 --> 07:03.564
Mmm. Just the green ones?

07:03.566 --> 07:04.898
Yeah, left over
from St. Patty's Day.

07:04.900 --> 07:08.001
Interesting. Food in Ops.

07:08.003 --> 07:09.569
Hetty know
about this?

07:14.008 --> 07:15.474
Got it.

07:15.476 --> 07:16.675
Hey, Callen.

07:16.677 --> 07:17.942
What do you got, Nell?

07:17.944 --> 07:20.911
So, the exploding boat
is registered

07:20.913 --> 07:23.580
to one Stanley Maslow, DDS.

07:23.582 --> 07:25.748
DDS? He's a dentist.

07:25.750 --> 07:26.482
(crunching)

07:26.484 --> 07:28.484
We got an address.

07:28.486 --> 07:29.952
Eric, are you eating in Ops?

07:29.954 --> 07:32.387
(gulps)
No.

07:32.389 --> 07:33.855
(chuckles)

07:33.857 --> 07:35.389
NELL:
He lives in Simi Valley.

07:35.391 --> 07:37.591
You guys can be there
in 30 minutes.

07:37.593 --> 07:39.526
I hate the drive
to Simi Valley.

07:39.528 --> 07:41.361
I hate dentists.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.769
STANLEY:
<i> Hey, you're lucky.</i>
<i> I usually play tennis</i>

07:50.771 --> 07:52.670
on my morning off.

07:52.672 --> 07:55.173
Please, have a seat.
No, that's-that's fine.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.576
Thank you.
So, uh, how can a dentist help
the Navy?

07:58.578 --> 08:01.245
Well, it's about
your boat.

08:01.247 --> 08:04.248
There was a-a missile test
this morning,

08:04.250 --> 08:06.183
and I'm sorry to say
that something went wrong

08:06.185 --> 08:08.185
and your boat
was hit.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.686
Damaged?

08:09.688 --> 08:10.687
Destroyed.

08:10.689 --> 08:13.156
How is that possible?

08:13.158 --> 08:15.625
And-and what the hell is
the Navy doing testing a missile

08:15.627 --> 08:17.259
in Marina del Rey?

08:17.261 --> 08:19.227
Marina del Rey?

08:19.229 --> 08:21.012
Yeah, that's
where it's docked.

08:21.013 --> 08:22.796
Do you have any idea
what that boat is worth?

08:22.799 --> 08:25.032
I did upgrades.

08:25.034 --> 08:27.034
Dr. Maslow, your boat
wasn't at the marina.

08:27.036 --> 08:29.269
It was off
the Ventura coastline.

08:29.271 --> 08:32.272
That's impossible.

08:32.274 --> 08:34.807
Oh, my God.

08:34.809 --> 08:38.510
My son's been living
on that boat.

08:38.512 --> 08:40.512
He's
a-a college student.

08:40.514 --> 08:45.149
Spends school nights down there
and comes home on the weekends.

08:45.151 --> 08:47.885
(phone chimes)
Oh, thank God.
He's okay.

08:47.887 --> 08:50.020
"All-nighter, big project,

08:50.022 --> 08:52.222
crashed on friend's sofa."

08:52.224 --> 08:54.824
Okay. So...

08:54.826 --> 08:58.294
how the hell did my boat get
from the marina

08:58.296 --> 09:00.195
to the Ventura coast?

09:00.197 --> 09:02.797
Well, that's something
we're gonna have to figure out.

09:02.799 --> 09:04.799
Do you have any
enemies, Dr. Maslow?

09:04.801 --> 09:06.300
Not that I know of.

09:06.302 --> 09:08.602
I get along pretty well
with everyone.

09:08.604 --> 09:10.236
What about your son?
He have any enemies?

09:10.238 --> 09:12.571
My son?
(sighs)

09:12.573 --> 09:14.773
Look, Wyatt's a bit of a loner.

09:14.775 --> 09:16.241
He has been
since his mother died.

09:16.243 --> 09:18.243
I'm very sorry.

09:18.245 --> 09:19.877
He's thrown himself
into his work.

09:19.879 --> 09:22.046
Architecture.

09:22.047 --> 09:24.214
Look, he rubs people
the wrong way-- I get that--

09:24.216 --> 09:27.183
but not enough for anyone
to want to... kill him.

09:27.185 --> 09:28.984
One other
thing,

09:28.986 --> 09:31.953
we found some fentanyl
in the wreckage.

09:33.089 --> 09:36.824
I'm a volunteer dentist
for the Smile Squadron.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.225
Yeah,
we-we cruise

09:38.227 --> 09:41.728
down to Ensenada and give
free dental work to the poor.

09:41.730 --> 09:44.630
Fentanyl's used
for wisdom teeth extractions,

09:44.632 --> 09:47.666
stuff
like that.
You left narcotics unattended?

09:47.668 --> 09:51.002
It was locked up in the hold
with 20 other boxes of supplies.

09:51.004 --> 09:55.072
And the boat was docked behind
a locked gate in the marina.

09:55.074 --> 09:56.173
Least
it was

09:56.175 --> 09:58.575
last time I saw it.

09:58.577 --> 10:01.677
Sure hope
the Navy's got deep pockets.

10:03.180 --> 10:06.181
Yep. I don't
like dentists.

10:06.183 --> 10:07.916
His boat is more
important than his son.

10:07.918 --> 10:10.318
That fentanyl story,
very sketchy.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.019
Better keep an eye on this guy.

10:12.021 --> 10:13.620
M.T.E.

10:14.589 --> 10:16.288
My thoughts exactly.

10:16.290 --> 10:17.355
I text with
my daughter.

10:17.357 --> 10:19.290
Come on.

10:19.292 --> 10:21.358
(chuckles)

10:22.961 --> 10:25.027
(indistinct chatter)

10:29.366 --> 10:31.199
KENSI:
There he is. That's our guy.

10:31.201 --> 10:33.701
Deeks.
Yeah.

10:33.703 --> 10:36.103
Wyatt Maslow?
Detective Deeks,

10:36.105 --> 10:39.039
LAPD. This is Special
Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.

10:39.041 --> 10:40.040
My dad told me

10:40.042 --> 10:41.041
to expect you.

10:41.043 --> 10:42.709
Sorry, I can't shake hands.

10:42.711 --> 10:44.210
Did you
make this?

10:44.212 --> 10:45.311
It's stunning.

10:45.313 --> 10:47.063
Quite the master
with the X-Acto knife,

10:47.064 --> 10:48.814
huh?
You should see what I can do

10:48.816 --> 10:50.215
with a 3-D printer.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.051
When were you last
at the marina?

10:53.053 --> 10:56.354
Yesterday morning. Uh, left the
boat about 7:00 a.m., I guess.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.156
How did it end up in Ventura?
We're gonna
review

10:59.158 --> 11:01.108
the security footage.

11:01.109 --> 11:03.059
You know anyone that
would want to hurt you?
No.

11:03.061 --> 11:04.760
I mean, I don't know.

11:04.762 --> 11:06.027
Maybe.
What does that mean,

11:06.029 --> 11:07.695
maybe?
Well...

11:07.697 --> 11:09.263
there's this one guy, Josh.

11:09.265 --> 11:10.764
Uh, Joshua Pettiford.

11:10.766 --> 11:13.366
Okay. What's going on with him?

11:13.368 --> 11:15.167
My ex-roommate.
Computer science major.

11:15.169 --> 11:18.270
He's the reason I had
to move on to my dad's boat.

11:18.272 --> 11:20.338
You two weren't getting along?
Total slob.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.007
Up every night till 3:00 a.m.

11:23.009 --> 11:24.808
Snores like a jackhammer.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.810
I tried, but I couldn't.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.912
After months of fighting
over everything,

11:28.914 --> 11:31.314
I finally moved out of the dorm.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.316
And for that you think
he'd blow up your boat?

11:33.318 --> 11:35.251
The guy's got
mad computer skills,

11:35.253 --> 11:37.052
and he's totally unstable.

11:37.054 --> 11:40.055
Computer skills. Okay,
like-like what, like hacking?

11:40.057 --> 11:41.756
Day and night.

11:41.758 --> 11:44.358
Where's his dorm room?
Yeah, might want

11:44.360 --> 11:47.660
to pick up
some hazmat suits first.

11:49.397 --> 11:51.430
CALLEN:
<i> Want a slurp?</i>

11:51.432 --> 11:53.398
No, thanks.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.266
Mint is healthy
for you.

11:55.268 --> 11:57.201
In Spanish it's
called<i> yerba buena, </i>

11:57.203 --> 11:58.869
which is the "good herb."

11:58.871 --> 12:00.170
(chuckles)

12:00.172 --> 12:02.405
You really think there's
some real mint in there?

12:02.407 --> 12:05.875
That's all artificial
flavoring and coloring.

12:05.877 --> 12:08.377
Blue and yellow F, D and C.

12:08.379 --> 12:11.213
Fresh, Delicious, Curative.

12:11.215 --> 12:14.349
Artificial coloring is
made from petroleum, G.

12:14.351 --> 12:16.451
Petroleum.
Makes it go down easier.

12:16.453 --> 12:18.419
It also keeps my joints
very lubricated.

12:18.421 --> 12:21.088
Your green arteries clogged.

12:21.090 --> 12:22.456
(chuckles)

12:23.859 --> 12:25.124
SAM:
Heads up.

12:26.894 --> 12:28.426
(sighs)

12:28.428 --> 12:30.027
New purchase.

12:30.029 --> 12:31.328
No plates.

12:31.330 --> 12:34.164
SAM: Yeah, that's
probably not a housekeeper.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.465
Definitely
doesn't look like FedEx.

12:39.470 --> 12:41.336
(shutter clicking)
SAM:
Notary?

12:41.338 --> 12:42.203
Realtor?

12:42.205 --> 12:43.837
Or a drug runner.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.709
CALLEN:
Eat up your spinach,

12:50.711 --> 12:53.078
Popeye, we're on the move.

12:54.047 --> 12:56.447
(engine starts)

13:04.856 --> 13:06.488
(siren blares)

13:08.825 --> 13:12.793
Driver, turn the engine off,
throw the keys out the window.

13:12.795 --> 13:13.927
Not again.

13:13.929 --> 13:15.728
SAM:
What the hell?

13:15.730 --> 13:18.363
Going for the keys!

13:18.365 --> 13:20.898
Now open the door
from the outside,

13:20.900 --> 13:23.867
showing me both hands, sir.
Passenger, too.

13:29.774 --> 13:33.942
Good, good. Now walk
backward slowly as
possible, gentlemen.

13:33.944 --> 13:35.443
SAM:
We're federal agents.

13:35.445 --> 13:37.511
My badge is
in my right back pocket.

13:37.513 --> 13:38.512
And we're both armed.

13:46.855 --> 13:49.422
(Callen sighs)

13:50.458 --> 13:52.291
My apologies,

13:52.293 --> 13:54.059
gentlemen.

13:54.060 --> 13:55.826
Satisfied?
We had a rash of
burglaries, and you two

13:55.829 --> 13:57.528
have been parked there
for over an hour.

13:57.530 --> 13:59.329
We were on a stakeout.
Okay, well,

13:59.331 --> 14:00.931
could we offer
any assistance?

14:00.932 --> 14:02.532
(scoffs) I think
you've done enough already.

14:02.534 --> 14:04.967
(knocking)
KENSI:
Dr. Pettiford?

14:07.504 --> 14:09.303
(chuckles): Oh.
Wow.

14:11.407 --> 14:14.441
Yeah. Wyatt
was not exaggerating.

14:14.443 --> 14:17.076
DEEKS:
This is bringing back
some happy memories.

14:17.078 --> 14:19.378
KENSI:
Oh, my gosh, you lived
like this in college?

14:19.380 --> 14:22.447
Well, for a second
there, I thought I was
back in your bedroom.

14:22.449 --> 14:23.448
Oh-ho-ho.

14:23.450 --> 14:24.782
(both chuckling)

14:24.784 --> 14:25.983
Touché.

14:25.985 --> 14:28.485
Got a laptop
on the desk.

14:32.791 --> 14:34.924
(whispers):
Yeah, let's see here.

14:34.926 --> 14:36.859
(beeping)

14:38.028 --> 14:40.094
Huh. What do you think of that?

14:40.096 --> 14:42.162
Revolutionary War flag?

14:42.164 --> 14:44.931
Well, he's either
a well-rounded student
of American history,

14:44.933 --> 14:48.034
or he's a card-carrying
member of the Tea Party.

14:48.036 --> 14:49.435
What...?

14:49.437 --> 14:50.969
What the hell?

14:50.971 --> 14:52.837
It's a brand-new
flash drive.

14:52.839 --> 14:54.238
Oh!
Oh... whoa!

14:56.275 --> 14:58.441
Really?

14:58.443 --> 15:01.110
(beeps, buzzes)

15:01.112 --> 15:04.046
Bet he didn't buy that
at the app store.

15:14.491 --> 15:17.124
Security cameras
in the marina didn't
record after midnight.

15:17.126 --> 15:19.860
When they came back on
at 6:00 a.m.,

15:19.862 --> 15:21.228
the boat was gone.
So the bad guys

15:21.230 --> 15:22.646
are covering their tracks.

15:22.647 --> 15:24.063
What about the software
from the defense contractor?

15:24.066 --> 15:26.099
The hack has the trademark
of an online group

15:26.101 --> 15:28.201
that call themselves
Disavow.

15:28.203 --> 15:30.836
NELL:
They're anonymous hackers,
but we have a chat room tip

15:30.838 --> 15:34.105
to a possible local member
who just so happens to be...

15:34.107 --> 15:36.124
Josh Pettiford.

15:36.125 --> 15:38.142
Exploding thumb drive dude
just bought himself a trip
to the boatshed.

15:38.144 --> 15:40.577
Have to find him first.
No. To nail this guy,

15:40.579 --> 15:42.245
we need to infiltrate his group,

15:42.247 --> 15:44.146
which is always
easier said than done.

15:44.148 --> 15:46.214
Well, I wouldn't mind
a little undercover...

15:46.216 --> 15:48.282
Forget it, Beale.
You're too old.

15:48.284 --> 15:49.249
NELL:
Ooh, okay,

15:49.251 --> 15:51.050
so, then, I guess it's my...

15:51.052 --> 15:53.119
Listen, with
all due respect,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.187
these are students--
we need some fresh blood.

15:55.189 --> 15:56.321
HETTY:
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:56.323 --> 15:59.357
I'd like you to meet
Blaze Talcott

15:59.359 --> 16:01.425
from Stanford University.

16:01.427 --> 16:05.229
She's an expert
in network security.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.030
Hi.
So...

16:07.032 --> 16:09.265
just to clarify, you
brought a... student here?

16:09.267 --> 16:10.532
GRANGER:
Blaze interned

16:10.534 --> 16:12.967
with NCIS Monterey,
and she has a job waiting

16:12.969 --> 16:15.302
at Quantico Cyber Division
when she graduates.

16:15.304 --> 16:17.270
You're a senior in college?
Crazy, right?

16:17.272 --> 16:19.138
HETTY:
Just what this mission needs.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.973
I'm sorry, but isn't

16:20.975 --> 16:23.275
this software-controlled
material?
Her clearance

16:23.277 --> 16:25.377
exceeds yours, Ms. Jones.

16:26.346 --> 16:27.978
All right, then.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.146
Well, let's all
get to work.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.484
Hey. I'm, uh,

16:34.485 --> 16:36.719
Tech Operator
Eric Beale.
I've heard all about you.

16:36.721 --> 16:38.053
ERIC:
Oh, yeah?

16:38.055 --> 16:39.421
Oh, cool fingernails.

16:39.423 --> 16:41.222
(chuckles)
Something to look at

16:41.224 --> 16:43.324
when you're...
writing code all day.

16:43.326 --> 16:44.525
Ah, yeah.

16:44.527 --> 16:46.460
Okay.
(clears throat)

16:47.229 --> 16:48.461
Intelligence Analyst Nell Jones.

16:48.463 --> 16:50.996
And you must be Kensi

16:50.998 --> 16:52.597
and Deeks?
Yes, we are.

16:52.599 --> 16:54.732
Nice to meet you.
Hi. How you doing?

16:54.734 --> 16:56.633
NELL:
So, Blaze--

16:56.635 --> 16:58.067
that's some nickname, huh?

16:58.069 --> 16:59.668
Uh, it's not a nickname.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.303
I was conceived
at a Bon Jovi concert.

17:02.305 --> 17:04.238
Oh. That
explains it.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.240
Been there.
ERIC: Great,
so let's begin

17:06.242 --> 17:08.041
by brainstorming some techniques

17:08.043 --> 17:09.375
to get Blaze inserted.
Uh, sure.

17:09.377 --> 17:11.009
Great. So the hackers
will definitely

17:11.011 --> 17:12.777
take over your computer
and search through every byte.

17:12.779 --> 17:15.146
We'll prep a laptop
with, um...

17:15.148 --> 17:17.081
Hacker code,
illegally downloaded songs,

17:17.083 --> 17:19.316
pirated software and porn.

17:19.318 --> 17:20.517
Did you just say porn?

17:20.519 --> 17:21.651
She definitely just said porn.

17:21.653 --> 17:22.652
Got to be legit.

17:22.654 --> 17:23.653
Wow. To be honest,

17:23.655 --> 17:24.720
kind of like this girl.

17:24.722 --> 17:27.289
They'll insist
I turn my camera on.

17:27.291 --> 17:29.090
All right, kids...

17:29.092 --> 17:30.691
let's put on a show.

17:40.068 --> 17:42.701
SAM:
Thank you, Kaleidoscope.

17:45.372 --> 17:48.072
We got the Mini
from Simi Valley, Eric. Thanks.

17:48.074 --> 17:50.240
No problem.

17:50.242 --> 17:52.075
You know what?

17:52.077 --> 17:53.810
I'm, uh...

17:53.812 --> 17:56.679
I'm gonna stay out here
in case she comes out.

17:56.681 --> 17:58.313
I'll just wait.

17:58.315 --> 17:59.414
They're not real clowns.

17:59.416 --> 18:01.449
They're just
little puppet clowns.

18:01.451 --> 18:02.716
Wonderful.
(laughs)

18:02.718 --> 18:04.551
Don't worry.

18:04.552 --> 18:06.385
It has to be dark
for them to come to life.

18:06.388 --> 18:08.488
You hope.

18:09.791 --> 18:13.058
(lively orchestral music
playing)

18:14.661 --> 18:18.328
¶ ¶

18:21.266 --> 18:22.765
(orchestral music continues)

18:22.767 --> 18:24.466
Could you just
not do that?

18:24.468 --> 18:26.334
Could you just not?

18:26.336 --> 18:28.036
(music ends)

18:28.037 --> 18:29.737
All right,
good job, everybody.
That's it for today.

18:29.739 --> 18:32.072
See you guys next week.
Class at 2:00.

18:32.074 --> 18:33.473
Thanks, Alex.

18:34.375 --> 18:37.142
CALLEN:
Excuse me, miss?

18:37.144 --> 18:39.210
SAM:
Special Agents Hanna,

18:39.212 --> 18:40.678
Callen, NCIS.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.312
And you are?

18:42.314 --> 18:44.647
Malee. Malee Vipada.

18:44.649 --> 18:46.649
That's an interesting puppet.
From Thailand.

18:46.651 --> 18:49.351
Like me.
I understand you know
a Stanley Maslow?

18:49.353 --> 18:51.753
Dentist from Simi Valley.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.621
Uh, I don't really know him.

18:53.623 --> 18:55.589
But you did go to
his house today.

18:55.591 --> 18:58.725
Well, his son Wyatt
is my boyfriend.

18:58.727 --> 19:00.426
He left blueprints

19:00.428 --> 19:02.795
at my apartment--
I was just dropping them off.

19:02.797 --> 19:04.763
Anything unusual going
on in Wyatt's life

19:04.765 --> 19:05.697
these days?

19:05.699 --> 19:07.298
No. I mean...

19:07.300 --> 19:08.599
he's a pretty solid guy.

19:08.601 --> 19:10.300
What about
his old roommate,

19:10.302 --> 19:11.601
Josh?
Oh, my God,

19:11.603 --> 19:13.402
complete and total freak.

19:13.404 --> 19:15.637
Josh was the T.A.
in my CS class.

19:15.639 --> 19:17.472
Computer science?

19:17.474 --> 19:19.607
Yeah. I'm a theater major,
but they make us take

19:19.609 --> 19:21.475
Coding for Poets.
Josh helped me

19:21.477 --> 19:22.843
with my homework
a few times.

19:22.845 --> 19:24.277
What makes him a freak?

19:24.279 --> 19:25.544
A) He never bathed,

19:25.546 --> 19:28.847
and B) he took my phone
when I wasn't looking.

19:28.849 --> 19:30.648
Took selfies
for me to discover.

19:30.650 --> 19:31.849
He texted himself

19:31.851 --> 19:33.517
and acted like I started it.

19:33.519 --> 19:36.219
Huh, well, maybe that's his way
of flirting with you.

19:36.221 --> 19:38.287
Uh, no, thank you.

19:38.289 --> 19:41.256
But, I mean, through Josh,
I met Wyatt, so...

19:41.258 --> 19:42.790
it's all good.
MAN:
Hey, sorry, Malee,

19:42.792 --> 19:44.525
can you help us pack up?

19:44.527 --> 19:47.294
Yeah, uh, got to get back.

19:47.296 --> 19:49.629
Maybe Josh is the jealous type.

19:49.631 --> 19:51.230
So get back

19:51.232 --> 19:52.898
at the competition
the only way he knows how.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.133
With a top secret Navy missile.

19:58.404 --> 20:01.438
Beale, love what you've
done with the place.
Show him the code

20:01.440 --> 20:02.806
for the JPL hack.

20:02.808 --> 20:04.541
It's amazing.
After five minutes

20:04.543 --> 20:06.242
of hack chat,
Josh took the bait.

20:06.244 --> 20:08.544
They've already moved
to a private site.

20:08.546 --> 20:10.046
(beep)
BLAZE:
Yes!

20:10.047 --> 20:11.547
He loves my zero-day
and man-in-the-middle attack.

20:11.549 --> 20:12.614
Way to go, Eric.

20:12.616 --> 20:14.282
Couldn't have done it
without you.

20:14.284 --> 20:15.616
DEEKS:
Wow.

20:15.618 --> 20:17.417
Am I detecting
a sense of chemistry here?

20:17.419 --> 20:18.484
Mm-hmm.

20:18.486 --> 20:20.486
Are you kidding me?

20:20.488 --> 20:22.154
She's like a little sister.

20:22.156 --> 20:23.188
I'm training

20:23.190 --> 20:24.322
a junior agent.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.556
This is the educational process.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.623
Right.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.558
So... you don't think she's hot?

20:29.527 --> 20:31.393
She's not my type.

20:32.295 --> 20:34.561
BLAZE:
Guys, he wants my camera on.

20:34.563 --> 20:36.696
Uh, all right,
quiet on the set, please.

20:36.698 --> 20:38.564
Really?
Always wanted
to say that.

20:40.868 --> 20:42.267
Hello there.

20:42.269 --> 20:43.601
Wow. (laughs)

20:43.603 --> 20:45.903
You sure write some killer code.
Tip of the iceberg.

20:45.905 --> 20:49.306
Who can I put
on the TSA no-fly list for you?

20:49.308 --> 20:51.274
Seriously?

20:51.276 --> 20:53.709
All right...
let me ask you a question.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.477
Blaze away.

20:55.479 --> 20:57.912
If an attacker does a scan
looking for open TCP ports,

20:57.914 --> 21:00.447
can all of the packets
use a spoofed IP address?

21:00.449 --> 21:02.149
Ooh, uh, that's
a tricky one.

21:02.150 --> 21:03.850
You know what, why don't
you tell him that, um...

21:03.852 --> 21:06.586
BLAZE:
No. Any SYN/ACK responses
to the TCP SYN segments

21:06.588 --> 21:08.688
go to the spoofed address.

21:08.690 --> 21:10.890
Open TCP ports are not detected.

21:10.892 --> 21:12.458
Okay.

21:12.460 --> 21:13.625
We should meet.

21:13.627 --> 21:14.892
Look out for a text.

21:14.894 --> 21:16.560
Ciao.

21:17.563 --> 21:19.396
Yes, yes,

21:19.398 --> 21:20.497
yes!

21:20.499 --> 21:21.898
BLAZE (squeals):
We did it!

21:21.900 --> 21:22.899
DEEKS:
Oh.

21:22.901 --> 21:25.201
That's all very educational.

21:25.203 --> 21:27.203
(Eric and Blaze laughing)
Oh, yes.

21:27.205 --> 21:29.572
I'm learning a few things, too.

21:33.711 --> 21:35.744
BLAZE:
We could have played online.

21:35.746 --> 21:38.480
Well, it's better...

21:38.482 --> 21:40.682
in person.

21:40.684 --> 21:43.785
All right, now, given a
random array of numbers,

21:43.787 --> 21:46.554
implement a merge-sort function
to arrange in ascending order.

21:46.556 --> 21:49.490
You want me to write code
while playing chess?
And...

21:49.492 --> 21:50.991
telling me why
you don't have

21:50.993 --> 21:53.393
much of an online presence
after high school.

21:53.395 --> 21:56.429
I value my privacy.
Don't you?

21:56.431 --> 21:58.998
All right, code away, Blaze,
I'll handle the chess.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.333
Uh, looks like
he's trying a Danish Gambit.

22:01.335 --> 22:02.534
Respond with E-5,

22:02.536 --> 22:04.502
then B-C-4.

22:04.504 --> 22:07.671
Looks like the signal
to shut up.

22:07.673 --> 22:10.974
My turn. Who started Disavow?

22:10.976 --> 22:12.875
A guy named Isaac,

22:12.877 --> 22:16.278
but no one really knows
his true identity.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.713
He's a bit
of a legend.

22:18.715 --> 22:21.582
What happens if I join you?

22:21.584 --> 22:23.850
I mean, it's like
climbing Mount Everest.

22:23.852 --> 22:25.384
Okay? I mean, we
just do it 'cause

22:25.386 --> 22:28.586
it's there, you know?
Not for evil or for money.

22:30.523 --> 22:31.955
Here's your code.

22:31.957 --> 22:35.024
Sorry to bother you guys--
we're in from out of town.

22:35.026 --> 22:36.558
Do you know
if there's a... Is there

22:36.560 --> 22:37.959
a bike shop
that's close to here?
Yeah,

22:37.961 --> 22:39.660
we got a flat
and our, uh,

22:39.662 --> 22:42.329
rental shop
is a few miles away, so...

22:42.331 --> 22:44.698
You can try the place
after the playground.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.367
Oh... Why do you even
wear a helmet?
Oh, Sorry. I'm sorry.

22:47.369 --> 22:49.369
That hard head of yours
could crack the cement.

22:49.371 --> 22:52.271
Honey, I don't think
this is the time.
Yeah, well, we got a flat

22:52.273 --> 22:53.572
because he insisted
on going through the grass

22:53.574 --> 22:55.006
and I said that
there would be thorns.
There's

22:55.008 --> 22:57.541
obviously glass in the parking
lot, 'cause since when

22:57.543 --> 22:58.708
do palm trees have thorns?

22:58.710 --> 23:00.911
The palm stem is scandent

23:00.913 --> 23:03.780
because of the rugged, hooked
prickles that could shed.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.681
I minored in botany.
You also majored in bother-me.

23:05.683 --> 23:07.683
(chuckles)
(Deeks mock-chuckles)

23:07.685 --> 23:09.685
Oh, you're funny.
Maybe you should audition

23:09.687 --> 23:11.787
at The Comedy Store
while I go shop at Rodeo, huh?

23:11.789 --> 23:14.656
We got to capture all the
sights, you know what I mean?

23:14.658 --> 23:15.890
Only two days left
in the honeymoon.

23:15.892 --> 23:17.725
Things are going well,
I think, so far.

23:17.727 --> 23:19.827
Oh, sorry, can you
hand me my, uh,

23:19.829 --> 23:21.762
my pop...
soda?

23:21.764 --> 23:23.797
Where's your head?
Who did I marry?
Really, really? Really?

23:23.799 --> 23:26.699
What did I marry, huh?
Really?

23:26.701 --> 23:28.534
Oh, my gosh.

23:28.536 --> 23:30.402
Oh, wow.
This is nice.

23:30.404 --> 23:33.671
With two versions--
Python and C++?

23:33.673 --> 23:35.105
Wasn't sure
which one you wanted.

23:35.107 --> 23:38.575
Hey, my laptop. Stop!

23:38.577 --> 23:39.842
Come on, Kens.
Hey, whoa, whoa.

23:39.844 --> 23:41.743
(chuckles) Deeks, Deeks.
Oh!

23:41.745 --> 23:43.311
You're not gonna catch him.

23:43.312 --> 23:44.878
Why did you give us a flat tire?
It was our justification

23:44.881 --> 23:46.881
for stopping at the chess park.
Well, you should
have listened

23:46.883 --> 23:48.983
to me. We could have said
bad brakes, loose chain...
No, we had

23:48.985 --> 23:50.751
to sell it visually,
all right? And he

23:50.753 --> 23:52.586
totally bought it. Why...
Are we still in character?

23:52.588 --> 23:53.753
Great.

23:53.755 --> 23:55.755
Go, go!

23:55.757 --> 23:57.123
What else is in

23:57.125 --> 23:58.858
that backpack?

23:58.860 --> 24:00.926
Everything to keep her safe.

24:06.633 --> 24:08.833
Then we have a problem.

24:18.177 --> 24:19.709
So nothing threatening from

24:19.711 --> 24:21.544
Josh to Wyatt?
Nothing.

24:21.546 --> 24:23.946
Wyatt asks Josh
to clean up the room.

24:23.948 --> 24:26.648
Josh replies in one word.
Well,
if you're smart,

24:26.650 --> 24:29.517
never put anything in a text
that can come back and bite you.

24:29.519 --> 24:30.851
However, between
Malee and

24:30.853 --> 24:34.521
Wyatt, a plethora
of lovey-dovey emojis.

24:34.523 --> 24:37.190
CALLEN:
"Miss u miss u wanna kiss u"?
Aw,

24:37.192 --> 24:38.491
young love.
(short beep)

24:38.493 --> 24:40.025
Ooh, Just got
a message

24:40.027 --> 24:42.560
from the Coast Guard
Marina del Rey.

24:42.562 --> 24:45.496
It looks like
the Point Dume cameras

24:45.498 --> 24:47.130
got the boat on night vision.

24:47.132 --> 24:49.132
They're
currently

24:49.134 --> 24:51.167
working on enhancement.
Great,

24:51.168 --> 24:53.201
we'll check it out. Kensi
and Deeks have Josh covered?
Yes,

24:53.204 --> 24:56.471
the GPS tracker is in place
and we were able to clone

24:56.473 --> 24:57.939
the thumbprint
using the soda bottle.

24:57.941 --> 24:59.774
Good.
And Josh
admitted to

24:59.776 --> 25:01.976
Blaze that it was his crew
that stole that her backpack.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.477
They went
through it with

25:03.479 --> 25:06.079
a fine-tooth comb,
and she's in the club.

25:07.248 --> 25:09.514
Keep us posted.
MAN:<i> This way.</i>

25:12.485 --> 25:14.918
Here you go.
Really? You could
have just asked me.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.185
More fun this way.

25:18.122 --> 25:21.189
Yeah. So, uh, Jeremy actually
bought the place last August.

25:21.191 --> 25:22.823
How can you afford a house?

25:22.825 --> 25:24.758
Well, a little help
from Roller Raccoon, huh?

25:24.760 --> 25:26.593
My gaming app
for the smartphone.

25:26.595 --> 25:27.827
Should have called it Cash Cow.

25:27.829 --> 25:28.928
Heyo.
Heyo.

25:30.231 --> 25:31.630
(both whooshing)

25:34.101 --> 25:36.768
I went to school with a
thousand guys like those two.

25:36.770 --> 25:38.269
Smart? Successful?

25:38.271 --> 25:40.671
Try dorky.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.272
So... I mean,
living room's a cool place

25:42.274 --> 25:45.041
to just sort of chill, kick
back, write some code or...

25:45.043 --> 25:46.742
you can power up
on nutrition or...

25:46.744 --> 25:49.277
Caffeine, got energy drinks.
Whoa, whoa,

25:49.279 --> 25:50.544
critically low on chips.

25:50.546 --> 25:53.113
Food run.

25:55.817 --> 25:58.117
Nice ride.
Yeah? Borrow it
any time you want.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.520
(door closes)
Yup. Uh, well, uh,
why don't you,

26:02.522 --> 26:05.073
uh, make yourself at home.

26:05.074 --> 26:07.625
You want to play a little
<i> Battlefield Hardline?</i>

26:07.627 --> 26:09.460
Oh, I shouldn't.

26:09.461 --> 26:11.294
I don't want to see you
cry when I kick your ass.

26:16.668 --> 26:19.535
Yeah, prepare to die.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.871
Okay, the scooter's clear.
Cueing the car.

26:22.873 --> 26:23.905
(tires screeching, thump)
DEEKS: Aah!

26:23.907 --> 26:26.540
You hear that?
Yeah.

26:26.542 --> 26:28.642
KENSI: Are you
okay? Don't move.
DEEKS: Aah! Oh, God.

26:28.644 --> 26:30.677
KENSI:
Don't move, sweetheart.
DEEKS: Aah!

26:30.679 --> 26:32.278
Help. Hi,
help me.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.247
Ouch. Ow.
Should I... Should I call 911?

26:34.248 --> 26:36.215
No, no, no, I got it, just help
me get the bike off of him.

26:36.217 --> 26:37.883
Okay. Yeah, yeah, okay.
I think I have some
internal injuries,

26:37.885 --> 26:39.684
I can't feel my spleen.
I can't feel my spleen.

27:00.339 --> 27:01.771
Eric, Eric, are you there?

27:01.773 --> 27:03.038
Read you loud and clear.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.272
I found the defense
contractor hack

27:04.274 --> 27:06.040
in Josh's computer.
I just sent it.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.908
Got it.
Great work.

27:07.910 --> 27:09.175
The cloned thumbprint

27:09.177 --> 27:10.843
opened all the files.
Even the locked ones.

27:10.845 --> 27:12.044
Who are you talking to?

27:12.046 --> 27:13.779
No one.

27:13.781 --> 27:15.213
Are you a cop?

27:15.215 --> 27:17.782
No.
Are you wearing a wire, huh?
Let me see.

27:17.784 --> 27:20.818
Come on, let me see.
Let me see it. (grunting)
Stop!

27:20.820 --> 27:22.319
Stop it, you're hurting me!
Kensi,

27:22.321 --> 27:23.837
Deeks...
Move in.

27:23.838 --> 27:25.354
I swear to God,
I'll kill you if you're a cop.

27:25.357 --> 27:27.056
Freeze.
Federal agents.

27:27.058 --> 27:29.324
Oh, aah, aah!

27:29.326 --> 27:32.360
(coughing)

27:32.362 --> 27:33.928
(Kensi laughs)

27:33.930 --> 27:35.629
Was that necessary?

27:37.132 --> 27:39.632
You guys weren't really
in a bike accident, were you?

27:39.634 --> 27:41.800
It turns out my spleen
is gonna be fine.

27:41.802 --> 27:43.735
Look, I've never seen this
before, okay? I mean,

27:43.737 --> 27:45.603
I didn't write it,
I didn't send it,

27:45.605 --> 27:47.304
I don't know how it
got on my computer.

27:47.306 --> 27:49.756
We know how much you hate Wyatt.
He was

27:49.757 --> 27:52.207
a neat freak. We didn't get
along, okay? I don't hate him.
But when he

27:52.210 --> 27:54.743
started going out with
Malee, you got jealous.
Oh,

27:54.745 --> 27:57.712
my God. Look, Malee is a pain in
the ass code kitten, all right?

27:57.714 --> 28:00.614
She used to beg me for
homework help. He can have her.
You left

28:00.616 --> 28:02.349
selfies on her phone.
Yeah, she
asked me

28:02.351 --> 28:03.750
to take them.
So what you're

28:03.752 --> 28:04.884
telling us is you didn't

28:04.886 --> 28:06.952
want a relationship with her?

28:06.954 --> 28:10.689
Why would I waste my time
and money with a girlfriend

28:10.691 --> 28:12.957
when the Internet
is full of free porn?

28:12.959 --> 28:14.992
That's a valid point.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.293
Hey.
DEEKS: Hey.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.395
What are you doing
on my laptop?
Seriously?

28:18.397 --> 28:20.397
Josh and Isaac,
the leader of Disavow,

28:20.399 --> 28:22.399
have been fighting
in the back room of their

28:22.401 --> 28:24.834
Dark Web site.
How did you get
in the back room?

28:24.836 --> 28:26.368
You gave me the password, fool.

28:26.370 --> 28:29.003
Josh wants to use
their hacking skills for

28:29.005 --> 28:30.637
a political
agenda.
No, to

28:30.639 --> 28:32.372
expose government
and corporate corruption,

28:32.374 --> 28:35.274
okay? I'm actually
making a difference here.
Wow, look at

28:35.276 --> 28:36.408
you, Dudley Do-Right.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.676
But Isaac wants to keep it pure.

28:38.678 --> 28:40.678
So, hacking for hacking's sake.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.313
Josh was winning folks over and
they were turning against Isaac.

28:44.649 --> 28:46.382
NELL:
Guys, something new here.

28:46.384 --> 28:49.318
The code on Josh's computer
was planted by Isaac.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.086
You can see it
in the coding patterns.

28:51.088 --> 28:53.855
Well, that's interesting.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.257
So it seems that Isaac planted

28:56.259 --> 28:58.125
the software on your computer
to frame you.

28:58.127 --> 29:00.728
Oh, really?

29:00.729 --> 29:03.330
Wow. Thanks. Okay, so we
done here? Will you guys leave?

29:03.332 --> 29:05.732
And by the way, you're
never gonna find Isaac.

29:05.734 --> 29:06.933
You're never gonna find him.

29:06.935 --> 29:08.701
Oh, ye of little faith.

29:08.703 --> 29:11.670
We've unraveled Isaac's
encrypted, relayed messages

29:11.672 --> 29:14.172
twice around the world.
Turns out Isaac

29:14.174 --> 29:15.840
is a young man
we've all heard of.

29:15.842 --> 29:17.274
A young man by
the name of...

29:17.276 --> 29:20.777
Wyatt Maslow.

29:20.779 --> 29:21.811
Hello, Isaac.

29:22.780 --> 29:24.012
By the way,

29:24.014 --> 29:27.115
I'm in awe
of your talent.

29:27.117 --> 29:29.883
Not too many people can
hack a guided missile.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.886
I was never going to do it.

29:33.888 --> 29:36.788
I've never, ever caused
any harm with a hack.

29:36.790 --> 29:38.756
It goes against my philosophy.

29:38.758 --> 29:40.057
It's just a hobby.

29:40.059 --> 29:41.291
What
happened? Uh,

29:41.293 --> 29:44.294
Josh drive you crazy
as a roommate?

29:44.296 --> 29:46.362
Hey, was... was Josh
gonna take over

29:46.364 --> 29:48.163
Disavow?
No.

29:48.165 --> 29:49.898
Then why?

29:51.434 --> 29:55.436
Malee begged me to do it.

29:55.438 --> 29:58.238
I had to defend her honor.
You had to

29:58.240 --> 29:59.439
defend her honor?

29:59.441 --> 30:01.707
They were doing homework...

30:03.811 --> 30:06.778
and Josh gave her a drink.

30:06.780 --> 30:08.045
She got sleepy.

30:08.047 --> 30:10.714
Next thing she knows,
he's on top of her,

30:10.716 --> 30:13.049
kissing her, pulling
her pants down.

30:13.051 --> 30:15.284
And he would've raped her
if she didn't fight back.

30:15.286 --> 30:16.885
Did she file a police report?

30:16.887 --> 30:18.786
She knew they'd just
screw up the investigation

30:18.788 --> 30:21.054
and Josh would walk.

30:21.056 --> 30:23.489
She said that her plan
was the only sure way

30:23.491 --> 30:25.958
to send him to jail.
And you went along with this?

30:27.962 --> 30:30.127
Is Malee your first girlfriend?

30:32.798 --> 30:35.064
You must really be in love.

30:35.066 --> 30:38.067
I would do anything...

30:38.069 --> 30:41.870
for her.

30:41.872 --> 30:43.404
Oh, what
a sociopath.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.239
Look, I never
touched her, okay?

30:45.241 --> 30:47.107
Why would Malee make
up a story like that?

30:47.109 --> 30:49.176
Look, I don't know,

30:49.177 --> 30:51.244
all right? I mean,
he's just as crazy as him.
It sounds like

30:51.246 --> 30:53.613
we need to spend some
quality time with Malee.

30:53.615 --> 30:55.448
(electric whoosh)

30:55.450 --> 30:57.216
Callen and Sam
need to hear this.

30:59.420 --> 31:01.520
Go ahead, Eric.

31:01.521 --> 31:03.621
Blaze had some doubts about
Malee's heritage and appearance.

31:03.624 --> 31:05.557
Her nose and cheekbones.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.025
So we dug a little deeper.

31:07.027 --> 31:09.193
Turns out her Thai
passport is a fake.

31:09.195 --> 31:12.629
Malee's real name is Taman
Budiano and she's from Jakarta.

31:12.631 --> 31:14.331
Indonesia.

31:14.332 --> 31:16.032
Her parents were killed
by the police there in 2009.

31:16.034 --> 31:17.033
Members of

31:17.035 --> 31:18.134
Jemaah Islamiyah.

31:18.136 --> 31:19.268
The group that bombed the

31:19.270 --> 31:20.953
stock exchange,
embassies, hotels.

31:20.954 --> 31:22.637
She tried to steal the military
hack off Josh's computer.

31:22.640 --> 31:23.939
Yeah, but it

31:23.941 --> 31:25.340
wasn't there.
Which is why she

31:25.342 --> 31:27.342
ditched you and jumped
in bed with Wyatt.

31:32.915 --> 31:34.047
Blaze did pretty good.

31:34.049 --> 31:36.049
No, Blaze did great.
Where is she?

31:36.051 --> 31:37.483
Isn't she with you?

31:37.485 --> 31:41.019
No. We sent her back
to Ops hours ago.

31:42.655 --> 31:44.287
Malee would
never do that.

31:44.289 --> 31:46.322
Did you hack
any other Navy systems?

31:46.324 --> 31:47.623
Did you?
I guess.

31:47.625 --> 31:50.993
Which ones?
Lasers,
rail guns.

31:50.995 --> 31:52.494
Was she ever alone
with your laptop?

31:52.496 --> 31:54.896
Maybe, but there's
nothing on it. The...

31:54.898 --> 31:57.298
There's a portable hard drive
in a safe in my dad's house.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.300
Did you tell her about it?

32:06.942 --> 32:08.141
Where are we, Eric?

32:08.143 --> 32:09.475
Kaleidoscope and facial rec

32:09.477 --> 32:10.909
firing on all cylinders.

32:10.911 --> 32:12.343
Kensi and Deeks en route
to Malee's house.

32:12.345 --> 32:13.444
SAM:
What about Blaze?

32:13.446 --> 32:15.212
Comms are dead,
not responding to texts.

32:15.214 --> 32:16.680
CALLEN:
Where's the safe, Wyatt?

32:16.682 --> 32:19.249
It's in the bedroom
down the hall, on the left.

32:24.388 --> 32:25.987
Check the
kitchen.

32:27.156 --> 32:29.156
Dad.

32:29.158 --> 32:30.490
Dad?

32:30.492 --> 32:31.924
Sorry,

32:31.926 --> 32:33.292
Wyatt.

32:34.928 --> 32:36.227
Why would...

32:36.229 --> 32:39.396
Oh, my God.

32:39.398 --> 32:42.531
He didn't do anything.

32:46.169 --> 32:48.235
Sam.

32:49.338 --> 32:51.971
(sighs)

32:56.010 --> 32:58.543
With that software...

32:58.545 --> 33:01.012
terrorists could destroy
just about anything.

33:01.014 --> 33:04.048
Including the entire
Pacific Fleet.

33:16.028 --> 33:19.696
I need an update on Malee's
apartment, Mr. Deeks.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.030
DEEKS:
The place is empty.

33:21.032 --> 33:22.197
Almost like she moved out.

33:22.199 --> 33:23.398
Her car's missing, too.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.333
Looks like they left
in a hurry.

33:25.335 --> 33:27.068
Well, that security camera's
been smashed.

33:29.439 --> 33:30.571
See if you can find anything,
Eric.

33:30.572 --> 33:31.704
Got the mirror
of a motor scooter.

33:31.707 --> 33:34.507
Like the one
at the Venice house.

33:34.509 --> 33:35.441
We hear anything from Blaze?

33:35.443 --> 33:36.975
Nothing yet.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.511
I got bad news that's about to
get worse.

33:40.513 --> 33:42.713
I got an earwig that's crushed.

33:42.715 --> 33:45.015
And that's definitely
one of ours.

33:45.984 --> 33:48.551
They ditched the scooter.

33:48.553 --> 33:49.552
Why would Blaze

33:49.554 --> 33:50.753
go after Malee on her own?

33:50.755 --> 33:52.104
GRANGER:
The girl's resourceful,

33:52.105 --> 33:53.454
but that would be
way out of line.

33:53.457 --> 33:55.023
KENSI:
I've seen Blaze in action.

33:55.025 --> 33:56.724
She could kick Malee's butt.

33:56.726 --> 33:59.126
One-on-one, yes... but in
this case she was outnumbered.

33:59.128 --> 34:01.394
MAN:
Put your hands up!

34:06.634 --> 34:10.268
Let's just hope that they've
taken her as a hostage.

34:10.270 --> 34:11.702
Okay, I've got them

34:11.704 --> 34:15.272
on a traffic camera,
First and Beaudry.

34:15.274 --> 34:17.274
That's two blocks from the
theater where Malee studies.

34:17.276 --> 34:19.409
CALLEN:
<i> We got eyes on the Mini.</i>

34:24.048 --> 34:26.281
Looks like somebody's home.

34:26.283 --> 34:28.483
Malee's got two
guys with her.

34:28.485 --> 34:31.185
And one possible hostage.

34:52.574 --> 34:55.174
They didn't have time
to complete the data transfer.

35:02.649 --> 35:04.649
How many of these creepy things
you think they got in here?

35:04.651 --> 35:08.119
There's got to be hundreds,
maybe thousands.

35:08.121 --> 35:10.721
It's a good place
to hide a hard drive.

35:14.059 --> 35:16.059
(gunshots)

35:17.662 --> 35:20.529
(gunfire)

35:23.433 --> 35:24.799
(grunts)

35:25.468 --> 35:28.101
(grunts)

35:29.070 --> 35:31.170
Where's Malee?

35:31.172 --> 35:33.137
I'll cover the exit.

35:35.774 --> 35:38.174
Federal agent!
Drop your weapons!

35:38.176 --> 35:40.142
We walk
or the girl dies.

35:41.078 --> 35:42.577
Okay, okay.

35:42.579 --> 35:44.211
Don't hurt her.

35:49.617 --> 35:51.183
Now!

35:53.620 --> 35:55.519
(grunting)

35:56.855 --> 35:58.554
Cuff him.

35:58.556 --> 36:00.188
Sam.

36:00.190 --> 36:02.223
(handcuffs clicking)

36:06.162 --> 36:07.761
Malee's on the run.

36:07.763 --> 36:10.163
She's headed into
Vista Hermosa Park.

36:10.165 --> 36:11.597
We'll try to get eyes on her.

36:11.599 --> 36:14.132
Searching traffic cams
and satellites.

36:28.615 --> 36:31.148
Is this a park
or a jungle?

36:33.352 --> 36:35.118
We've got to split up.

36:43.127 --> 36:45.160
Hey, watch it.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.770
West trail's clear, Sam.

36:56.772 --> 36:58.337
No sign of her.

37:01.675 --> 37:03.841
Got her.

37:03.843 --> 37:06.176
Crossing the lower field.
On it.

37:09.881 --> 37:11.647
Federal agents!

37:13.250 --> 37:14.249
Hey, what?

37:15.151 --> 37:17.618
(gunfire)

37:17.620 --> 37:19.720
Drop your weapon!

37:19.722 --> 37:22.189
I don't have a shot, Sam.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.594
Drop your weapon.

37:29.730 --> 37:31.496
MAN:
Please, please.

37:31.498 --> 37:33.531
CALLEN:
Let him go.

37:33.533 --> 37:35.499
(whimpering)

37:35.501 --> 37:37.601
Okay, okay.

38:05.330 --> 38:06.896
You're going to patch
that back up?

38:06.898 --> 38:08.597
They got a show tonight.

38:10.300 --> 38:11.799
¶ ¶

38:11.801 --> 38:15.269
¶ Another op'nin',
another show ¶

38:15.271 --> 38:18.739
¶ In Philly, Boston
or Baltimo'e ¶

38:18.741 --> 38:22.676
¶ A chance for stage folks
to say "Hello" ¶

38:22.678 --> 38:26.312
¶ Another op'nin'
of another show ¶

38:26.314 --> 38:27.946
¶ Another job
that you hope that lasts ¶

38:27.948 --> 38:30.848
Why did Hetty want
to meet us here?

38:30.850 --> 38:33.550
I don't know.
Reward for a job well done?

38:33.552 --> 38:36.319
Eh, maybe she just wanted
to torture Sam.

38:36.321 --> 38:37.920
(Sam laughs wryly)

38:37.922 --> 38:41.323
Come with me, everybody.

38:41.325 --> 38:44.292
¶ Four weeks,
you rehearse and rehearse ¶

38:44.294 --> 38:47.762
¶ Three weeks,
and it couldn't be worse... ¶
Hey, Beale.

38:47.764 --> 38:51.265
Everyone... gather round.

38:51.267 --> 38:55.668
So, I wanted you all
to experience

38:55.670 --> 38:57.436
a bit of L.A. history.

38:57.438 --> 39:02.007
You know, when I first saw
Mr. Baker perform,

39:02.009 --> 39:05.310
(laughs): I think I was about
five years old.

39:05.312 --> 39:07.945
It was at a little girl's
birthday party

39:07.947 --> 39:10.347
given at the home
of Judy Garland.

39:10.349 --> 39:13.316
You were playmates
with Liza Minnelli?

39:13.318 --> 39:15.451
It was quite the soirée.

39:15.453 --> 39:17.086
(laughs)

39:17.088 --> 39:18.454
Tonight, we'll toast
with something

39:18.456 --> 39:19.655
wholesome for a change.

39:19.657 --> 39:21.123
Ooh.
(exclaiming)

39:21.125 --> 39:23.025
HETTY:
Oh, bravo.

39:23.026 --> 39:24.926
Thank you very much.
KENSI: Now we're talking.

39:24.928 --> 39:26.460
Nice.
And one for you.

39:26.462 --> 39:27.794
And one for you, sir.

39:27.796 --> 39:29.729
And one for Hetty.

39:29.731 --> 39:31.530
No ice cream for you?

39:31.532 --> 39:33.532
Uh, no, I'm just going
to go meet Blaze

39:33.534 --> 39:36.368
and some of her
friends from SWE.

39:36.370 --> 39:38.503
The Society of Women Engineers.

39:38.505 --> 39:40.404
Nell, it's just coffee.

39:40.406 --> 39:43.473
I'm going to talk to them
about careers in CS.

39:43.475 --> 39:44.807
It's like a mentoring thing.

39:44.809 --> 39:46.408
Really?

39:46.410 --> 39:47.842
That's your story?

39:47.844 --> 39:49.710
Yeah.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.512
Okay.

39:53.515 --> 39:55.681
Have fun.

40:13.133 --> 40:16.134
(sighs)

40:21.740 --> 40:24.674
Burning the midnight
oil, are we?

40:24.676 --> 40:27.410
Just retrofitted the drone
with infrared.

40:27.412 --> 40:29.512
Cool.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.680
Hmm.
So...

40:31.682 --> 40:33.448
how was Blaze?

40:33.450 --> 40:36.484
She's ready to move on.

40:37.453 --> 40:39.986
To Quantico, I mean.

40:40.955 --> 40:42.621
Fully trained.

40:42.623 --> 40:44.589
So, you met her friends?

40:45.158 --> 40:47.491
They were busy texting.

40:47.493 --> 40:49.559
I mainly talked
to her dad.

40:49.561 --> 40:51.027
He's an electrical
engineer.

40:51.029 --> 40:54.130
Blaze thought that he and I...

40:54.132 --> 40:55.631
have a lot in common,

40:55.633 --> 40:58.066
like we could be friends.

40:58.068 --> 40:59.534
Seriously,

40:59.536 --> 41:02.035
that guy's got to be,
like, 45 years old.

41:04.205 --> 41:05.504
Hey, I'm sorry.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.472
(laughs softly)

41:07.474 --> 41:09.740
It's all right.

41:12.945 --> 41:14.511
Can I fly that?

41:14.513 --> 41:15.912
(laughs softly)

41:15.914 --> 41:17.713
Go for it.

41:19.516 --> 41:21.082
But be careful.

41:22.051 --> 41:23.650
I'm serious.

41:32.660 --> 41:35.093
You're going to need this.

41:36.062 --> 41:37.728
Yes, ma'am.

41:37.730 --> 41:39.229
Why so many buttons?

41:39.231 --> 41:40.530
Guess you haven't done it

41:40.532 --> 41:42.465
in a while.

41:42.467 --> 41:46.502
5.5 channel requires
a new skill set.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.505
So it takes a little time
and understanding.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.906
All right,

41:50.908 --> 41:52.240
so you still have
your standard throttle,

41:52.242 --> 41:54.775
yaw and elevator function.

41:54.777 --> 41:56.243
But...

41:56.245 --> 41:58.812
aileron
and collective pitch.

41:59.481 --> 42:01.614
Uh-huh.

42:01.616 --> 42:03.983
Ready?

42:03.985 --> 42:06.085
Ah...
(laughing)

42:06.087 --> 42:08.954
ERIC:
Whoa. So cool.

42:08.956 --> 42:10.055
All right,
easy, Maverick.

42:10.057 --> 42:12.023
Let's just...
let's just hover.

42:16.128 --> 42:17.494
And...

42:17.496 --> 42:18.695
All right, easy.

42:18.697 --> 42:19.796
Okay, I'm letting go.

42:19.797 --> 42:20.896
You've got this.
All right, all right.

42:20.899 --> 42:22.598
Tilt left.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.933
More throttle.

42:24.935 --> 42:28.569
Losing altitude. Tilt up,
not toward the floor.
