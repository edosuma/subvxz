17:05.607 --> 17:06.400

17:06.483 --> 17:08.902
I don't like the shape

17:55.032 --> 17:58.952
There's no consistent
two lines side by side.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.038
The lines are so thick and thin
and so erratic,

18:01.121 --> 18:02.998
but with a very weak outline

18:03.081 --> 18:05.459

the very heavy rose outline

18:05.542 --> 18:07.169
on the outside of the rose.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.213

18:13.759 --> 18:15.219
The outline's very deliberate,
very crisp.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.429
The black in the background
bringing forward the color

18:17.513 --> 18:18.680
really helps out.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.100

is a nice, smooth blend.

on tattoo number two

18:24.061 --> 18:26.855

18:48.001 --> 18:50.921

saturated black.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.214

It has a lot of textures.

It has a lot of tricks.
You got my interest.

you're gonna do.

tattoo number two.

This tattoo from a distance
is pretty sloppy.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.139
There's no evidence
of a clean outline.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.891
There's not just
any straight areas

19:02.975 --> 19:04.434

this is a strong image.

19:30.085 --> 19:31.712
Good-looking head

19:31.795 --> 19:33.255

pirouette to the bottom and die.
