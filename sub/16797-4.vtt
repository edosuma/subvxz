WEBVTT

00:15.149 --> 00:17.685
Previously on Blunt Talk.
Your neighbor Ronnie

00:17.785 --> 00:20.221
has made a porn parody
of Blunt Talk.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.956
- Blunt Cock?
- Outrageous!

00:23.057 --> 00:25.926
Get the lawyers to shut
this down immediately.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.329
It's just a break.
I need some time to think.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.565
Sylvia, darling,
are you all right?
I'm fine.

00:31.665 --> 00:34.768
Harry, what about me?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.104
Uh...

00:36.204 --> 00:37.371
It's a jump drive.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.507
It has all
my colleagues' files.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.709
But please be careful.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.512
This drought is deadly.

01:06.334 --> 01:09.036
Major, might we
be leaving soon?

01:09.137 --> 01:11.639
I promised Sylvia
I'd take her dancing.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.141
It is Saturday night, sir.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.709
Dancing?
You hate to dance, Harry.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.611
You always say
your thighs chafe.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.347
Well, Sylvia
enjoys it, sir.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.150
I'm sorry, Harry,
but I am not ready to go.

01:22.183 --> 01:25.253
This is an important story.
It could affect the lives
of millions.

01:25.353 --> 01:28.356
Cornelia's murdered friend

01:28.456 --> 01:31.725
seemed to be after
Rudolph Global

01:31.825 --> 01:34.328
and its CEO
Daniel Rudolph.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.363
Why, Major?

01:35.463 --> 01:37.398
Because they are set
to make a profit

01:37.498 --> 01:39.433
from this drought
so enormous,

01:39.533 --> 01:42.002
they may have committed
murder to protect it.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.238
Is there any
real proof, sir?

01:45.739 --> 01:48.509
No.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.012
Might we perhaps,
then, leave?

01:52.180 --> 01:54.047
Sylvia--
Harry, please!

01:54.182 --> 01:56.617
These people
assaulted Cornelia.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.352
This matters to me.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.624
I'll tell you what.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.226
Let's have a drink.

02:07.228 --> 02:11.199
But, Major,
Sylvia is important to me.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.501
She's freed me
from a lifetime of shame.

02:13.601 --> 02:16.270
I know, Harry.
It's wonderful
what she's done

02:16.370 --> 02:18.339
and it pains me
to have to bring this up,

02:18.439 --> 02:21.642
but I have thought
about it quite a lot

02:21.742 --> 02:25.379
and I'd like you
to consider

02:25.479 --> 02:28.516
having Sylvia move out.
Move out?

02:28.616 --> 02:31.419
What I would
suggest is that
she get her own place.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.486
Her own place?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.688
You could have Saturday
and Wednesday off.

02:34.788 --> 02:38.359
You see her then,
which is the usual
custody arrangement.

02:38.459 --> 02:42.230
I don't like the direction
of this conversation, Major.

02:42.296 --> 02:46.033
I just don't want you
to be hurt, Harry.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.835
Sylvia's very bright.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.070
She comes from
a prominent family,

02:50.238 --> 02:51.939
but she's too young
for you.

02:52.039 --> 02:55.976
She's not.
It's only a 25-year
age difference.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.645
That's true.

02:57.745 --> 03:02.483
But then, ahem, think
of the work she does.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.517
I don't judge.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.086
I'm just very
protective of you.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.456
Have you
ever considered

03:08.556 --> 03:11.091
how many men
she has slept with?

03:11.259 --> 03:15.062
No, sir, but have you
considered how many men
you've slept with?

03:15.263 --> 03:17.698
Yes, three.
What?

03:17.798 --> 03:20.534
There are
only two mentions
in the logbook

03:20.634 --> 03:22.670
of the love that
dare not speak its name.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.405
Well, I don't tell you
everything, Harry.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.107
What?
I'm entitled
to have some secrets.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.543
I was very unformed
in my 20s.

03:29.643 --> 03:33.781
But the logbook is meant
to be a complete accounting
of a life, sir.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.316
A complete accounting!

03:35.416 --> 03:38.118
A complete accounting
isn't possible, Harry.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.853
Too much goes on.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.155
But that was
our mission, Major!

03:42.290 --> 03:44.325
A complete accounting
of a life.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.127
Li-- like Boswell's
Samuel Johnson

03:47.361 --> 03:48.962
and I'm Boswell.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.832
Stop it, Harry.
You're irrational when
it comes to the logbook.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.934
Of course I am!

03:54.034 --> 03:57.505
I've spent years
recording every one
of your dreams

03:57.605 --> 03:59.407
and bowel movements
and tax audits.

03:59.507 --> 04:02.310
I appreciate all that
you have done, Harry, but--

04:02.343 --> 04:06.947
It was you who said
if we could understand
the life of one man,

04:07.047 --> 04:11.319
that one man
being Walter Blunt,

04:11.352 --> 04:13.787
then we could understand
all of humanity.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.023
I was wrong, Harry.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.527
It is impossible
to understand me

04:19.627 --> 04:20.928
or humanity.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.433
I would like
Sylvia to move out.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.067
But Herschel can stay?

04:27.335 --> 04:29.102
Herschel is homeless.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.704
Sylvia has a job

04:30.804 --> 04:33.507
working for Ronnie,
for Christ's sake.

04:33.607 --> 04:38.512
Are you really asking me
to choose between you
and Sylvia, Major?

04:48.021 --> 04:50.458
Um...

04:51.992 --> 04:54.662
Halt. Halt.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.964
Halt?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.802
What's the matter?
I'm sorry, Martin.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.438
I don't feel comfortable
with you doing that.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.006
I have low
self-esteem down there.

05:06.106 --> 05:09.209
Why? You're beautiful
down there.
I'm not.

05:09.377 --> 05:12.245
You know,
it's like how you think
your penis is small

05:12.380 --> 05:15.015
and I have to reassure
you that it isn't.
It isn't, right?

05:15.115 --> 05:18.486
I've told you, I've been
with three guys and yours
is the second biggest.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.521
But I'm still not reassured
by those numbers.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.423
How is it that every
conversation we have

05:22.523 --> 05:24.525
comes back to the size
of your penis?

05:24.625 --> 05:26.927
For once we're talking
about my kitty cat.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.696
I know.
I'm sorry.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.631
I wish you'd let me
go back down there.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.266
I'm still in the oral
stage of development
according to Freud.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.935
What other stages
are there?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.137
Anal and genital.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.609
Can you hold me?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.512
We have it so good.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.247
We live better than almost
anyone else on the planet

05:47.415 --> 05:50.751
and yet sex often feels
like a meaningless nightmare.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.021
I know, but at least
we're not alone, right?

05:54.121 --> 05:58.258
Sometimes I feel alone
even when you hold me.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.060
It's not your fault.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.496
It's the human condition.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.264
The what condition?

06:04.465 --> 06:06.500
The human condition.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.068
Wh-what was that?

06:08.168 --> 06:10.804
The human condition.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.573
Oh.

06:17.445 --> 06:20.548
This kid
is so fucking stupid.

06:20.648 --> 06:24.017
Darling, sweetheart,
look what turned up
at the front door.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.654
Oh!
It's my favorite couple.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.456
Big Red and Little Sylvia.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.458
Hello, Ms. Song.
Oh, please.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.626
I'm Helen to everyone
except Ronnie.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.996
What does Ronnie call you?
Stanley.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.331
Yeah, it was my dad's name.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.501
He died a few years ago.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.903
Can you believe that
Walter threw them out?

06:43.003 --> 06:45.105
Do you know how much
you two would fetch
on the open market?

06:45.205 --> 06:47.107
Ronnie,
we're not for sale.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.477
You know I hated
that experience.

06:49.577 --> 06:53.614
Yeah, and-- and we weren't
exactly thrown out, Ronnie.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.583
The major and I
both agreed--

06:55.683 --> 06:58.385
Whatever.
You're both free to stay.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.621
We can play Scrabble,
Boggle, bridge.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.623
We can make a sequel
to Blunt Cock, huh?

07:02.723 --> 07:05.593
Oh, yeah.
That's how
I like my cocks.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.394
Blunt Cock 2, right?
Yeah.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.896
You like sequels,
don't you?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.034
Ah.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.037
You got to stop
beating yourself up,
Walter.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.607
If I was your sponsor,
that's what I would tell you.

07:19.707 --> 07:22.510
I should never have asked
them to leave.

07:22.610 --> 07:27.114
I-I was in
the wrong, Herschel.
All wrong.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.617
Well, you can always tell them
you're diabetic and ask
for forgiveness.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.785
That's what I'd do.
The damage is done.

07:31.885 --> 07:35.422
But, you know,
it's so embarrassing

07:35.523 --> 07:39.126
to admit that
I had got used

07:39.226 --> 07:42.029
to having Harry
all to myself.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.666
I get it.
He's one of those people
that's like a salt lick.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.768
You just want to put
your mouth on him.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.369
Yes.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.539
And I want him
to be happy.

07:51.605 --> 07:55.375
I don't want to stand
in-- in-- in his way.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.377
That's right.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.280
They say the greatest act
of love is to let someone go.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.949
They do?

08:02.049 --> 08:05.052
Yes. And there's also
good old 69.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.154
Oh, I'll drink to that.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.157
To 69.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.569
Jim, uh, did you read my story
on the tainted baby food
in Wisconsin?

08:21.635 --> 08:23.904
Yeah, it looks great.
Just tighten it up.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.906
You didn't read it,
did you?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.576
No.
I worked really
hard on that.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.243
What are you doing?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.946
Just writing Celia's name
over and over again.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.582
Why?

08:34.648 --> 08:35.916
'Cause I'm obsessing
about her

08:36.016 --> 08:38.586
like a dog chewing
on its own paws.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.588
Oh, I hate
when that happens.

08:40.688 --> 08:44.324
Maybe we should get you one
of those plastic cowls to help
break the obsession.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.426
That's not a bad idea.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.028
There is a pet store
down the street.

08:48.128 --> 08:51.231
Good, now can I tell you
about my problems?
S-sure, buddy.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.702
Well, I don't think
it's going that good
with Rosalie 2.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.871
She says all these
truthful, morbid things.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.239
Like what?

08:59.339 --> 09:01.174
That life is meaningless.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.943
That we're all alone.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.079
That we live in prisons
of our own construction.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.315
Jesus. God.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.884
Yeah, you're right,
those are truthful,
morbid things.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.721
Also she's tone-deaf
and she doesn't like me
to go down on her

09:13.821 --> 09:15.789
and I'm in the oral stage
of development.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.258
Wait, wait.
D-do you-- do you
hear music?

09:18.358 --> 09:20.460
That's the other
thing, Martin.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.230
I-I keep hearing
sad music.

09:23.330 --> 09:27.134
I think I'm losing my mind.
Í think I have lost it.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.637
Going crazy.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.740
I think you actually
are hearing sad music.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.896
What are you guys doing?
Did you read my tainted
baby food story?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.765
Yes, and we needed
a break.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.500
Also we might play
a set at Goldie's.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.770
I'm Tits, she's Ass.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.938
Yeah, I'm not sure my ass
is quite big enough, Rosalie.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.640
Hi, Celia.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.009
Oh, uh, hi, Jim.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.144
How are you able to play
music during this time?

10:11.244 --> 10:12.913
How are you
filled with song?

10:15.883 --> 10:18.151
What the hell
is going on now?

10:18.251 --> 10:21.388
Jim, I'm not
filled with song.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.617
Ooh, this is a beauty
right here, isn't it?

10:50.718 --> 10:52.552
Don't fucking
go there, Herschel.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.421
Oh, sorry, sir.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.825
Excellent driving,
by the way.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.093
Yeah.
And an excellent
martini last night.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.862
You have many
hidden qualities.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.563
Oh, thank you, General!

11:03.731 --> 11:05.398
Uh, you're
to call me Walter.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.835
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just-- I know
you miss Harry

11:07.935 --> 11:10.771
and I'm trying
to make everything feel
as familiar as possible.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.940
You're very kind.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.342
And, uh, Herschel,
no saluting.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.810
Oh, sorry.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.946
Oh, I got
to go to the store
and get some olives.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.147
We--
Herschel.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.082
Oh!

11:22.182 --> 11:23.650
I'm coming.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.119
Ooh, you're fast
for a old guy.

11:26.219 --> 11:29.757
This could be our Enron.
This could be our Madoff.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.359
This could be our WikiLeaks.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.995
What's happening
with the drought in LA

11:35.095 --> 11:38.298
is a case study
for the entire country.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.301
So I want
to get hold of

11:41.401 --> 11:45.338
the elusive CEO
of this company,

11:45.438 --> 11:47.007
Daniel Rudolph.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.777
He's an almond mogul
turned water baron.

11:49.877 --> 11:54.014
Why? Because water
is the new gold.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.484
Water is the new oil.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.988
So let's get
him on the show.
Any questions?

12:01.088 --> 12:04.124
Uh, Walter,
um, where's Harry?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.259
That's not
the kind of question
I'm looking for, Martin.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.863
Oh, sorry, Walter,
but Jim didn't tell me
we were meeting.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.265
Well, we're on a break
that you wanted.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.367
But you can still tell me
about meetings.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.937
I don't have to.
Celia, Jim, settle down.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.972
I don't want to have
to separate you two.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.941
We're already separated.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.844
Excuse me.
Uh, Walter?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.445
Yeah, the mean girl
out front

12:25.545 --> 12:28.015
told me to tell you
that the Blunt Cock
lawyer is here.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.450
Oh, shit.
Let's go, Walter.

12:30.550 --> 12:34.187
All of you,
I want drought stories.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.656
Jim, get the science angle.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.892
Shelly, what's happening
internationally.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.328
Celia, get me Rudolph.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.863
Martin.
Uh-huh.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.664
You can proofread what
everyone comes up with.

12:44.832 --> 12:48.001
Herschel, stay here.
I won't need you
in this meeting.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.970
Yes, Walter.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.739
Attention, everyone.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.176
If you need some tea,
some coffee, some chili dogs,

12:56.276 --> 12:58.045
I am working
for Walter now.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.847
Well, what happened
to Harry?

12:59.947 --> 13:01.048
We think
he skipped town.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.850
My guess,
him and Sylvia

13:02.950 --> 13:04.751
ran off to Vegas
for a quickie wedding.

13:04.852 --> 13:05.953
Is Walter okay with this?

13:06.053 --> 13:08.321
Mm, he puts up
a strong front,

13:08.421 --> 13:10.423
but he cries out
in his sleep.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.362
I'll have a chili dog.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.634
Ronnie, what the hell
are you doing here?

13:21.869 --> 13:24.037
I'm my own counsel.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.873
Your counsel is late.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.774
When I'm late,
I charge myself.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.542
You don't want
a proper lawyer?

13:29.642 --> 13:33.313
I am a proper lawyer.
Erotica is the family
business.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.383
I used to be with the DA.
I cut my teeth on the Phil
Spector trial.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.386
Where's our lawyer?
I don't know.
He's new.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.259
I'm very offended
by what you did, Ronnie.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.895
Very.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.030
I welcomed you
into my home.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.366
One time.
And there were
300 people there.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.003
Why did you make
a mockery of me?

13:56.103 --> 13:58.505
I didn't.
I meant it
to be a tribute.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.909
I'm an artist.
I see something
and I have to use it.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.045
Harry?

14:05.145 --> 14:06.779
Thanks, Red.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.316
What's going on, Harry?
I don't understand.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.285
I'm sorry, Major.
I'm working for
Ronnie now.

14:13.486 --> 14:17.257
First you lampoon me,
now you steal my man?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.459
I haven't stolen anybody
and I told you

14:19.559 --> 14:22.295
that Blunt Cock
is an homage.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.397
"Homage" is French
for "tribute."

14:24.497 --> 14:27.935
I know that,
you smut peddler.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.103
Don't let him
rile you, Walter.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.040
Brought some
refreshments, Walter.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.243
Harry!
Herschel.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.378
How could you, Major?

14:38.478 --> 14:41.048
So sorry I'm late,
everybody.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.616
Um, oh, tea service.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.386
You're the new lawyer?
All right, let's get
down to business.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.555
Herschel,
wait outside, please.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.159
You're welcome
to stay, Red.

14:57.030 --> 15:00.033
I don't know who some
of the people in here--

15:00.133 --> 15:01.701
That's not important.

15:01.801 --> 15:05.572
I want every DVD
of Blunt Cock recalled.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.075
Are you nuts?
Do you know how much
that would cost?

15:08.175 --> 15:11.078
No, I'm not nuts.
And I don't care
how much it'd cost.

15:11.178 --> 15:16.083
You are not an artist
and that movie is merde,

15:16.183 --> 15:18.385
which is French
for "shit."

15:18.485 --> 15:20.820
Go ahead,
keep insulting me.

15:20.988 --> 15:24.091
You can't get me on libel
or defamation of character.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.859
You would have
to prove in court

15:26.994 --> 15:29.429
that you are not
well-endowed.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.198
Are you ready to do that?!

15:31.298 --> 15:32.832
Are you ready to go
to war with me?!

15:33.033 --> 15:34.634
Huh?!
Hey! Whoo!

15:34.734 --> 15:37.070
Don't you talk
to the general like that.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.206
You about to get
some dental work, bitch.

15:39.306 --> 15:42.175
Herschel, put those away
and wait outside.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.444
Okay, Walter.

15:44.544 --> 15:48.248
I still don't know who
some of these people are,
Mr. Blunt,

15:48.348 --> 15:52.319
but Mr. Birmingham,
I'm afraid, does make
a very strong argument.

15:52.419 --> 15:55.155
That's right, Walter!
You can't beat me.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.623
But--

15:59.259 --> 16:02.329
but I am sorry
that I hurt your feelings.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.599
Let's go, Rosalie.
Yes, Walter.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.636
Uh...

16:12.472 --> 16:14.374
Wow.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.942
Jim?

16:16.043 --> 16:19.679
Do you realize it
takes thousands of years
to create an aquifer

16:19.779 --> 16:22.882
and that more than half
of the world's aquifers
are in danger?

16:23.083 --> 16:24.384
No, I didn't.
Yeah.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.387
But what's on your head?
Is that for hearing loss?

16:27.487 --> 16:30.157
No, my hearing's fine.
It's a dog cowl.

16:30.257 --> 16:33.526
I'm wearing it
to help me focus
and not obsess about you.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.596
Oh, good,
because during
this break--

16:36.696 --> 16:38.398
Oh, okay.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.768
Jim, this is hard
for me, too...

16:41.868 --> 16:44.371
but it's important
that we start acting
more professionally.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.139
Fuck,
they're all meeting!

16:46.239 --> 16:47.240
Huh?

16:47.340 --> 16:48.641
Oh, shit.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.909
...Kazakhstan.

16:50.077 --> 16:53.113
And this is a dried-up
riverbed in, um--

16:53.213 --> 16:54.681
uh, s-somewhere.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.317
Excellent, Shelly.
Let's use that tonight.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.086
A drought primer
for our audience.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.554
Sorry we're late, Walter,
but nobody came to get us.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.123
Oh, that's fine, Celia.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.092
And, Walter,
I know you don't want
to talk about it,

17:05.158 --> 17:07.960
but I just want to say
I'm sorry about Harry
and Blunt Cock.

17:08.095 --> 17:12.632
Thank you, Martin.
Jim, what the hell
are you wearing?

17:12.732 --> 17:16.936
It's a-- a dog cowl,
Walter, to help me focus.

17:17.104 --> 17:20.673
And you're right.
Water is the biggest
story of the century.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.310
We're remaking the planet
in our own image

17:23.410 --> 17:25.178
like a--
a demented god.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.614
Demented god,
I like that.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.516
Let's get it
into the broadcast.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.984
Yes, but, Celia,
what about Rudolph?

17:32.119 --> 17:34.154
Well, you're right, Walter,
he's very elusive.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.656
Hasn't granted
an interview since 1983.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.458
I did speak
to the lawyer
and he said

17:38.558 --> 17:40.627
there is no way Rudolph
would come on Blunt Talk.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.664
Damn! I would like
to question that man.
Get him in front of me.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.434
Well, maybe you
could get to him through
his sister Margaret.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.270
She's not part
of the family business,
but she's a very public person.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.305
What do you have
in mind, Celia?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.274
The old reach-around?

17:54.374 --> 17:56.209
Yes, she's hosting
a fundraiser tonight

17:56.309 --> 17:59.979
for the Democratic
councilman, whose big issue,
interestingly enough,

18:00.147 --> 18:02.415
is for LA to have
a desalinization plant.

18:02.515 --> 18:06.253
Ooh, I like
the sound of this.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.621
Maybe I could go undercover

18:08.721 --> 18:11.258
as Walter Blunt, civilian.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.326
Can I be
your wingman, Walter?

18:13.426 --> 18:14.761
I'm very engaged
by this story

18:14.861 --> 18:18.498
and it-- it'll help me
forget my troubles.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.401
Will you take off
your cowl, Jim?

18:22.635 --> 18:23.570
Sure.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.205
Then you can come.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.174
We'll go right after
the broadcast.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.810
He shoots, he scores!

18:32.679 --> 18:35.682
Underground aquifers
supply 35%

18:35.782 --> 18:37.484
of the water used
around the globe.

18:37.584 --> 18:41.288
These reserves take thousands
of years to accumulate.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.590
The county jail
has cleared up the lice.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.758
We can interview
Adler tomorrow.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.628
I want you two
to stay late and prep.

18:48.728 --> 18:52.332
Great.
Uh, it will be
Martinelli time, right?

18:52.432 --> 18:54.867
So, like a demented god,

18:54.967 --> 18:57.670
we have altered
the planet's thermostat

18:57.770 --> 19:00.039
and are refashioning
the world in our own

19:00.207 --> 19:03.310
confused
and self-destructive image.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.779
Bah.
Sorry.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.516
Are you excited
for the fundraiser?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.918
I'm going for work,
Herschel, not pleasure.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.255
Look, if you can't
get it this time,

19:15.355 --> 19:16.623
I'll do it myself.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.358
It's not a problem.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.859
I want to do a good job.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.894
I know I have
big shoes to fill.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.301
Herschel.
Hmm?

19:28.401 --> 19:30.570
What is that
I'm feeling?

19:32.439 --> 19:34.574
My brass knuckle.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.578
I'll tie my own tie.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.248
All right.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.358
...93...

19:51.458 --> 19:53.626
94...

19:53.726 --> 19:55.495
95...

19:55.595 --> 19:57.430
Harry, where are ya?

19:57.530 --> 19:58.965
Stanley and I need
more tequila.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.234
Or bourbon
or rubbing alcohol.

20:01.234 --> 20:01.268
Or bourbon
or rubbing alcohol.
Something right away.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.702
Something right away.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.571
Shit, he's going
to slow us down.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.039
My family hates it
when I'm late.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.008
One moment, Ronnie.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.379
96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.080
There, all done, Major.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.148
Harry!
What?

20:16.249 --> 20:18.150
You called me Major again.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.320
Oh, God,
I'm so sorry.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.622
You're longing for him.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.493
Red, I need tequila
and baby oil and the remote.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.328
I'm coming, Ronnie.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.898
I'm sorry.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.674
Ah, thank you.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.710
Hey, Jim, slow down.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.745
That's your fifth
rum and Coke.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.681
Is that a lot?
I don't get out much.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.618
Good evening, everyone.

20:55.988 --> 20:59.426
Welcome to a night
of bidding, dancing,

20:59.526 --> 21:02.161
drinking,
and bidding some more.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.331
I'm Margaret Rudolph,
your host

21:04.364 --> 21:07.800
and also your auctioneer.
Hey, there she is.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.771
Now, unfortunately,
Councilman Sandler

21:11.871 --> 21:15.174
can't make it tonight.
He has shingles.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.410
Again.

21:17.510 --> 21:21.414
But he appreciates
your support very, very much.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.451
Are-- are we applauding
shingles?

21:24.551 --> 21:26.953
Shh. That's a very
painful condition.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.956
Now, our first
bid item tonight

21:30.056 --> 21:33.793
is a very interesting piece
from a local artist,

21:33.893 --> 21:37.530
Cindy Lockwood, who cites
among her influences

21:37.630 --> 21:39.031
the great Allan Jones.

21:39.131 --> 21:43.202
It's called
Have a Seat, Please.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.706
And we'll start
the bidding at $5,000.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.008
All right, who's gonna
kick us off?

21:49.108 --> 21:52.512
Kick things off, Walter.
That'll win her trust.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.881
Anyone?
Yes, great thinking.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.917
Yeah.
Oh, there we go.
There we go.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.452
We have our first bidder.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.554
All right,
do I hear 5,500?

22:01.654 --> 22:04.524
5,500?

22:06.058 --> 22:08.495
Well, then 5,000
going once,

22:08.595 --> 22:11.564
going twice,
sold to the gentleman
in the front,

22:11.664 --> 22:14.901
who I believe
is Mr. Walter Blunt,

22:15.001 --> 22:17.570
my favorite newscaster.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.979
Hey, hey.
Check this out.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.416
Oh, Walter's going
to love this.

22:29.516 --> 22:32.318
Duncan Adler has been writing
letters to the LA Times

22:32.419 --> 22:34.854
for years about
Rudolph Global's
almond farms

22:34.954 --> 22:37.023
sucking all the water
up out-- what?

22:38.825 --> 22:40.927
What were you doing?
Were you sniffing my hair?

22:41.027 --> 22:44.664
Yes, I was.
I'm sorry. Jeez.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.933
Okay, why were you
smelling my hair?

22:47.033 --> 22:50.102
Does my scalp
smell yeasty like
old popcorn?

22:50.202 --> 22:53.540
No. No, it's because--

22:53.640 --> 22:54.941
Martin?

22:55.041 --> 22:57.644
Uh, because I have
a crush on you, Shelly.

22:57.744 --> 22:58.978
Please don't hate me.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.913
Oh, God.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.783
I mean, I knew
something was going on.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.452
When did this start?

23:05.552 --> 23:09.288
Um, when I touched
your breasts during
your cancer scare.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.023
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.992
'Cause it felt good?
It was, like, right away.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.094
I was like, pfft!
Yeah, 'cause it's nice and--

23:15.194 --> 23:17.864
Supple.
Got a lot of texture.
Well, drop it!

23:17.964 --> 23:21.100
We're all going nuts here.
Jim loves Celia.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.570
I love Celia.
Celia loves Walter.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.337
Walter loves Harry.
Rosalie loves you.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.039
Wait, what?
What-- what do you mean?

23:27.139 --> 23:28.941
Oh, you know she still
pines for you,

23:29.041 --> 23:31.077
but she's--
she's tough.

23:31.177 --> 23:34.046
Anyway, drop it.
You have a girlfriend.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.148
I know.
Ugh, I'm-- ugh.

23:36.248 --> 23:41.020
I won't fantasize
about you sexually
ever again, I promise.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.524
Well, let's not make
promises we can't keep.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.794
I mean, I'm okay with
being naked in your mind.

23:47.894 --> 23:50.096
I am meant
to be worshipped.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.800
Get back to work.
Right.

23:58.738 --> 24:01.741
Do you see
Ms. Rudolph anywhere?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.611
No.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.515
Excuse me, young man.
Hmm?

24:08.581 --> 24:09.782
Would you like to dance?

24:09.882 --> 24:12.719
Um, sure.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.521
Uh, I'd-- I'd love to.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.603
Excuse me.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.639
Ms. Rudolph,
I-I was wondering

24:32.739 --> 24:35.875
if my new chair
came with a dance?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.978
Yes, and an apology.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.648
I'm so sorry
you ended up
with that thing.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.616
Oh, please.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.757
You're light
on your feet, handsome.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.592
Thanks.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.060
Are you a prostitute?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.195
What?
N-no.

24:56.295 --> 24:59.131
S-sorry.
I was just asking.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.068
The young men
at these things
are usually working boys.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.270
Oh, well,
not-- not me.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.674
I don't know
what's happening.

25:07.774 --> 25:10.476
Everyone at work is kind
of losing their minds
and breaking up.

25:10.577 --> 25:13.079
Jim and Celia,
Harry and Walter.

25:13.179 --> 25:16.115
When we hate ourselves,
it's hard to love others.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.284
Oh, God,
is there any hope?

25:18.384 --> 25:21.854
Yes, we have to face
our nightmares.

25:21.954 --> 25:26.793
So I was thinking
that if you want to go
down on me, you can.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.429
Really? Now?
Yes.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.264
You won't be in
your oral stage forever.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.207
Ready?
Ready.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.717
Oh, Martin.

25:50.817 --> 25:53.686
Oh, Martin!

25:57.156 --> 25:59.125
You know,
I am really interested

25:59.225 --> 26:01.794
in your candidate's
position

26:01.894 --> 26:03.830
on desalinization.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.635
Can we just dance
for a little while,
Mr. Blunt,

26:08.668 --> 26:10.870
and forget
the world's troubles?

26:10.970 --> 26:13.072
Yes, of course.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.743
And by the way,
you can call me Walter.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.078
All right, Walter.

26:19.178 --> 26:21.480
But I would like
to get together sometime

26:21.648 --> 26:24.951
and we can talk drought
all you want.

26:25.051 --> 26:28.554
Or we could raid
your wine cellar

26:28.655 --> 26:31.190
and actually have
a good time.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.126
That sounds very nice.
Mmm.

26:38.164 --> 26:41.133
Harry, Sylvia,
what are you doing here?

26:41.233 --> 26:43.002
Oh, hi, Walter.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.237
Councilman Sandler's
my second cousin.

26:45.337 --> 26:49.108
And Ronnie--
well, Ronnie gave me
the night off, sir,

26:49.208 --> 26:53.012
so Sylvia and I
could go dancing.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.947
Very nice, Harry.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.252
Did you know
he was going to be here?

27:01.688 --> 27:04.891
No, your family
invited us.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.059
Who was that?

27:07.159 --> 27:09.295
Oh, he's...

27:09.395 --> 27:12.198
a-- a dear, dear friend.

27:14.433 --> 27:17.569
They say that
two stars on opposite
ends of the universe

27:17.704 --> 27:20.106
can still be drawn
to each other.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.341
Maybe that's like
me and the major.

27:22.441 --> 27:25.912
Oh, you mean
quantum entanglement.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.733
Celia?

27:48.334 --> 27:51.237
Oh, Evelyn.
I didn't want
to wake you, tiger.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.572
Are you--
are you leaving?
Yeah, I got to go.

27:53.740 --> 27:57.309
I left you
a gift on the desk.
Knock yourself out.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.079
I t-- I told you, Evelyn,
I'm not a prostitute.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.849
You are now.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.119
No, I'm not.
