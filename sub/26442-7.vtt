17:47.567 --> 17:49.001
Coffee on three.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.138
One, two, three --

17:51.171 --> 17:52.705
C-O --
Yes, coffee!

17:57.244 --> 17:58.745
All set. With the new vent
on the water heater

17:58.778 --> 18:00.079
you shouldn't have
any more trouble.
Just curious...

18:00.113 --> 18:01.080
the amount of gas
that was leaking,

18:01.114 --> 18:02.549
it wouldn't be enough
to, like,

18:02.582 --> 18:05.118
change your mood, right?
-You kidding me?

18:05.152 --> 18:06.453
You could take
a couple of people

18:06.486 --> 18:08.421
who didn't know each other,
pipe that in --

18:08.455 --> 18:10.723
Oh! --
they'd be all warm and cozy...

18:10.757 --> 18:12.692
-Okay, thank you.
-When my in-laws come to visit,

18:12.725 --> 18:14.527
I just crank a little juice
in their --

18:14.561 --> 18:15.462
You have been thanked,
sir.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.300
Okay, this reconnecting.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.968
It's gonna take a little
more work than we thought.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.503
That's gonna take
some time.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.605
Uh, when do we have time?

18:25.638 --> 18:30.877
Uh, the holidays are crazy,
so how's January?

18:30.910 --> 18:33.045
JJ tours colleges
on the weekends,

18:33.079 --> 18:35.482
and then Dylan's track season
starts.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.417
And then it's spring break.
That's out.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.218
What about June?

18:38.251 --> 18:39.986
Uh, sure, late June?

18:40.019 --> 18:41.954
How late?
July?

18:41.988 --> 18:43.556
Yeah, it's a date.
All right.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.225
And we're really gonna do it
this time.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.026
Yeah.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.161
Yeah, yeah, no,
we're really gonna do it.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.866
"Cheers, Coach."

18:56.436 --> 18:58.805
Mmm!

18:58.838 --> 19:01.040
Lots of grounds.

19:03.476 --> 19:07.314
But, uh, for my money,
this beats Starbucks any day.

19:07.347 --> 19:11.584
"And it only cost $250 more."

19:11.618 --> 19:12.785
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, yeah.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.556
Oh. Mmm.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.759
Hey, Ray, just making sure
you saw that caution tape.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.594
Wouldn't want you
to go in it.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.096
[ Scoffs ]
What does it matter?

19:27.967 --> 19:31.137
This is where my park
was supposed to be.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.005
I thought
you might want to see this.

19:33.039 --> 19:36.243
Full approval?
How?

19:36.276 --> 19:38.811
It's because you followed
the rules.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.981
I went back to the permit place
to see what the problem was.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.485
Turns out, he just misplaced
one of your forms.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.353
I will do it!

19:46.386 --> 19:48.521
We had a good laugh
about it.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.156
I guess this means
your world view

19:50.189 --> 19:52.425
wasn't wrong after all.
[ Indistinct shouting ]

19:52.459 --> 19:53.860
I knew it.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.495
The world makes sense.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.364
I never lost faith.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.666
And the best part is,

19:59.699 --> 20:01.301
since I did it all
myself,

20:01.334 --> 20:03.370
I get to keep
this little guy.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.807
You're right, Ray.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.676
You did it all yourself.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.543
I'm happy for you.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.422
Winter.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.058
Okay, you can look.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.062
[ Laughs ]

20:30.096 --> 20:31.564
You got the beach chairs!

20:31.598 --> 20:32.999
Did you make lava flows?

20:33.032 --> 20:36.168
I can't believe we used
to take the time to make those.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.670
We're gonna
take the time again.

20:37.704 --> 20:38.705
For us.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.340
I got this, Jimmy.

20:40.373 --> 20:44.644
**

20:44.677 --> 20:45.445
I got it, too.

20:45.478 --> 20:53.920
**

20:53.953 --> 20:56.356
I finished
something else.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.825
* Hey, roommate,
can you spare a wife? *

20:58.858 --> 21:02.429
* I won't need her long,
just for the rest of my life *

21:02.462 --> 21:05.598
* And I love her now
like I loved her then *

21:05.632 --> 21:08.901
* We don't need to cut off
our oxygen *

21:08.935 --> 21:10.637
* Hey, roommate

21:10.670 --> 21:15.107
* I'll have her back
in a lifetime or two *

21:15.141 --> 21:17.243
Aw, darl--
* And the tree of love
is a Douglas fir *

21:17.276 --> 21:19.646
Oh, God, there's more,
is there? Okay.

21:19.679 --> 21:23.082
* And the squirrels
chase acorns all over her *

21:23.115 --> 21:23.916
* And that's not fair...
