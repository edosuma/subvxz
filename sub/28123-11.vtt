[RuPaul] Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

01:01.862 --> 01:05.766
You'll be performing
in your very own magic show.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.568
[cheers]

01:07.568 --> 01:09.436
Aah!

01:09.436 --> 01:11.004
Wow.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.973
I said ain't nothing--
no ketchup in here, baby.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.642
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.878
You never quite landed
those jokes.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.013
-Oh.
-Vanjie.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.616
You need to give us more
or else it's done.

01:22.616 --> 01:23.884
[RuPaul] Nina West.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.053
Your energy was so up,
it was great to watch.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.255
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.324
[applause]

01:30.324 --> 01:33.126
Vanjie, shantay, you stay.

01:33.126 --> 01:36.396
Shuga Cain, sashay away.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.242
Vroom.

01:49.242 --> 01:50.277
I'm a unicorn.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.012
It's a rhino, mama.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.714
Wait a minute.
Did you call me a rhino?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.115
[all laugh]

01:55.115 --> 01:57.384
So Shuga's gone,

01:57.384 --> 02:01.221
and I'm definitely saddened,
because Shuga's very talented

02:01.221 --> 02:02.723
and she's a sweetheart
through and through.

02:02.723 --> 02:06.326
"You all hold a very
special place in my heart.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.662
Make Nana proud. Shuga."

02:08.662 --> 02:10.197
We love you, Shug.

02:10.197 --> 02:12.065
I'm still shook
from the lip sync.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.568
Child, I'm just, whoo.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.671
Baby, when I tell you all
the words was speaking to me,

02:17.671 --> 02:21.108
I was just making sure they knew
Miss Thing is out of the drama.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.076
All right, you lip synced twice.

02:23.076 --> 02:26.079
No more, Mary.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.614
Wake up and smell the coffee.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.883
You get a new opportunity.
Don't take it for granted.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.985
[A'Keria]
So, Silk, how you feeling?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.588
'Cause I know like tonight
was one of those nights

02:34.588 --> 02:36.690
where they really added
some pressure on your back.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.692
Like, you almost was
gonna have to lip sync.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.693
[Silky] I guess that's
what I have to work on

02:39.693 --> 02:41.495
in this competition, right.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.431
Did I do everything I
could have done in that moment?

02:44.431 --> 02:46.867
But it's like I kinda
accepted the defeat.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.435
And that's what
I'm kinda disappointed

02:48.435 --> 02:49.870
in myself in right now.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.607
Because, like, I'm a girl
that will fight to the very end.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.810
After last week's
roach critique

02:56.810 --> 03:00.213
and this week's body critique,
I'm completely embarrassed,

03:00.213 --> 03:02.149
my pride is bruised,

03:02.149 --> 03:03.750
and it makes me feel like

03:03.750 --> 03:06.253
I'm getting worse and worse
in this competition.

03:06.253 --> 03:10.157
But, bitch, I cannot fold and
crack under this damn pressure.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.558
I just can't give up.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.026
[Brooke Lynn]
Nina, congrats.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.529
Oh, I feel fucking great.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.731
I feel so good.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.100
And I had a lot of fun
in this challenge.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.536
I just want to soak up this win.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.571
But I am not resting.

03:24.571 --> 03:28.341
I have to bring everything
that's Nina and kill it.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.976
Because everyone
who is here right now

03:29.976 --> 03:31.978
is absolutely gunning
for top four.

03:31.978 --> 03:35.382
And we've seen really
shocking things happen before.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.650
No one is safe.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.018
It's anybody's game
at this point.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.286
Oh, my God, ow.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.387
Bitches better
step our pussies up.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.993

sometimes the past can come back
and bite you in the ass.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.760
So if you want to be
America's next drag superstar,

04:53.760 --> 04:57.430
I sure hope you got
some extra padding, okurr?

04:57.430 --> 05:00.767

05:00.767 --> 05:03.069
Wait a minute. They said

when it's time to fake
bitch-slap a mother tucker.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.389
Yes!

05:22.389 --> 05:25.425
So for today's mini challenge,

05:25.425 --> 05:27.561
I'm bringing back
a little game we call

05:27.561 --> 05:30.130
[imitates Cher]
Slap Out Of It.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.399
[all laugh]

05:32.399 --> 05:34.968
But since I'm still
in litigation

05:34.968 --> 05:39.172
over allegedly slapping
a queen last season...

05:39.172 --> 05:40.840
[all laugh]

05:40.840 --> 05:42.542
You'll be fake-slapping
each other.

-Oh.
-Oh.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.012
[RuPaul] This is how it works.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.481
You come up
with some sassy lines

05:48.481 --> 05:50.984
that inspires
your fellow queens

05:50.984 --> 05:53.053
to fake-slap
the crap out of you.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.554
And in the end,

05:54.554 --> 05:58.091
the queen with the most
compelling reactions wins.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.759
[cheers and applause]
All right, then.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.061

Aah!

06:47.440 --> 06:50.377

this all is for you,

the same fucking character

So do you. You always play

your ass since week two.

-Oh, my goodness.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.932
It's so nice that you finally
gave Miss Celia her hair back.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.603
I told you this bitch
wouldn't say it.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.804
No, Ru, it's okay.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.173

I think I speak for everybody

07:26.746 --> 07:31.017
and really say that we all love
hearing your opinion.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.320
Good, 'cause I've got plenty
where it came from.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.555
Aah! Aah!

07:35.555 --> 07:36.690
There's one you can take home.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.191
I love your head.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.927
It reminds me of my testicles
after two hours in the bath.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.295
Oh, bitch.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.798
Well, I'll give you a few hours
to soak into that.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.603
Your makeup looks like
a kindergarten art project.

07:51.705 --> 07:52.939
Aah!

07:52.939 --> 07:55.108
[all laugh]

07:56.209 --> 07:57.344
Are you skeered?

07:57.344 --> 07:58.611
I wanted to talk
about her toupee

07:58.611 --> 08:00.880
and how she ain't got
no edges to mesh.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.816
-I ain't got no edges?
-Mm-mm.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.318
That's 'cause all of your--

Oh, bitch,
I ain't scared of you

08:11.391 --> 08:13.326
or that little brillo pad
you got in your hand.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.528
You're still ugly as hell.

08:15.528 --> 08:16.529
Oh, shit.

You made
your whole country proud

08:18.098 --> 08:20.400

Celine Dion.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.801
How's that make you feel?

right now.

-Yeah.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.378
What you got, bitch?

a dancer's slap.

08:35.382 --> 08:38.485
Keep spinning, bitch,

08:38.485 --> 08:42.489
I don't know a whole lot about
Canada or the people in it,

08:42.489 --> 08:44.657
but judging by your
Snatch Game, neither do you.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.627
Ohh.
[all laugh]

08:47.627 --> 08:48.795

08:48.795 --> 08:49.863

to slap a homeless person?

08:49.863 --> 08:52.665
-I think it's okay.
-Thank you.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.067
Oh!

08:54.067 --> 08:55.935
She slapped
the fuck out of you.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.570

09:30.170 --> 09:32.038
But it's lonely at the top,

09:32.038 --> 09:35.842
so I've arranged
a playdate for you

09:35.842 --> 09:39.045

10:09.042 --> 10:10.176

10:10.176 --> 10:11.244
Hey, cyst.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.681
Bitch, hold the fuck up.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.816
Why they brought
these bitches back?

10:16.816 --> 10:18.118
I don't like games.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.020
I don't play Uno, checkers,
fucking Monopoly.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.522
I don't know what's going on.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.757
Last time they brought other
girls that were eliminated in,

10:24.757 --> 10:26.793
it ended up scaring Vanjie.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.762
I worry and I pray

10:29.762 --> 10:32.599
that they're not gonna replace
some of us with some of them.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.738
Ladies, welcome back
the eliminated queens:

10:38.738 --> 10:44.577
Shuga Cain, Plastique Tiara,
Scarlet Envy, Ariel Versace.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.778
Yes.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.014
-Honey Davenport.
-What's good?

10:48.014 --> 10:49.282
Oh.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.050
And Soju.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.019
This is crazy.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.420
Now, for this week's
maxi challenge,

10:54.420 --> 10:56.890
you need to make over
one of the returning queens

10:56.890 --> 11:02.161
and transform her into a member
of your own drag family.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.396
#DragRace.

11:03.396 --> 11:07.634
Now, to my top six queens,
let me be clear.

11:07.634 --> 11:11.604
This is your challenge
to win or lose.

11:11.604 --> 11:15.175
The returning queens
are here for a makeover only.

11:15.175 --> 11:19.479
They will not be returning
to the competition.

11:19.479 --> 11:23.383
In fact, during crucial moments
of the makeover,

11:23.383 --> 11:26.586
they'll have to wear
these stylish pink mittens

11:26.586 --> 11:30.089
to assure all the work is yours.

11:30.089 --> 11:31.391
May God help us.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.126
[all laugh]

11:33.126 --> 11:35.695
Now, Brooke Lynn,
you won the mini challenge,

11:35.695 --> 11:39.032
so you get to pair up
the queens.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.636
So first, who do you pick
for yourself?

11:43.636 --> 11:45.138
I'm going to pick Plastique.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.472
Yay.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.141
[A'Keria]
I'm definitely not surprised

11:48.141 --> 11:50.677
that Brooke picked Plastique,

11:50.677 --> 11:53.146
because, I mean,
it's an easy makeover.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.714
Plastique's an easy canvas.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.383
Which queen
do you pick for Nina?

11:57.383 --> 12:00.086
I'm gonna say Shuga Cain.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.322
Wha!

12:02.322 --> 12:04.257
[both laugh]

12:04.257 --> 12:05.858
Which queen do you pick
for Yvie?

12:07.894 --> 12:08.895
I'm going to say Scarlet.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.563
-Come ova.
-Hi.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.099
My chemistry lady.

12:13.099 --> 12:16.235
Which queen do you choose
for A'Keria?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.236
Honey.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.172
-What's up?
-Hey, cousin.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.941
That's right,
Davenports in the house.

12:21.941 --> 12:25.478
It seems like Brooke Lynn
is trying to pair everybody up

12:25.478 --> 12:29.616
with somebody that she thinks
would physically work out

12:29.616 --> 12:31.684
or, you know, just have
a chemistry together.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.519
And who do you pick for Silky?

12:33.519 --> 12:34.754
Soju.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.558
[A'Keria] But Silky and Soju?

12:38.558 --> 12:40.593
Chicago queens.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.295
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.831
Mama plays
a very strategic game.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.833
This might work out for you,
Brooke.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.502
[Brooke Lynn]
What is your face?

12:49.502 --> 12:50.970
I'm smiling.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.171
[all laugh]

12:52.171 --> 12:53.673
[Soju]
You're not happy to see me?

12:53.673 --> 12:55.742
I'm really happy
to see you, girl.

12:55.742 --> 13:00.346
Bitch, that quiet-ass,
shady-ass Brooke Lynn,

13:00.346 --> 13:04.517
that bitch put me with Soju,
the bitch that went home first,

13:04.517 --> 13:08.154
the bitch that came in week one
looking like Ronald McDonald.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.857
You ain't gave me
shit to work with.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.860
Obviously Brooke Lynn sees me
as a top competitor for her,

13:13.860 --> 13:15.528
so that bitch trying
to get me out of here.

13:15.528 --> 13:19.499
[RuPaul] That means Vanjie
will get Ariel Versace.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.834
Just as I cyst-pected.

13:21.834 --> 13:25.238
Yay!
[all laugh]

13:25.238 --> 13:27.874
[RuPaul] Now, ladies,
to help you create

13:27.874 --> 13:29.909
a strong family resemblance,

13:29.909 --> 13:33.980
you can use materials
from the F&S Fabrics wall,

13:33.980 --> 13:35.682
Fierce! Drag Jewels,

13:35.682 --> 13:39.419
Rock Star Wigs,
and your own drags.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.921
Ooh, this is gonna be fun.

13:41.921 --> 13:46.492
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.963
Girl, I'm not gonna lie.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.231
I'm happy I got you.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.533
Well, yeah, hello.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.934
How are you holding up?

13:54.934 --> 13:56.636
Listen, the last few weeks
has been a fight.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.404
It's getting down to the wire.
It's just a few of you.

13:58.404 --> 13:59.806
Yeah. It's stressful.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.108
If you have one stray hair
flying the wrong the way,

14:02.108 --> 14:03.576
it could be the reason,
you know--

14:03.576 --> 14:06.379
Speaking of hair,
I hear some of my hair's gone.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.481
Right, what happened?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.450
Girl, I just left it
by accident.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.453
In the midst of things,
when I was eliminated,

14:13.453 --> 14:15.455
I was like super, like,
emotional packing everything,

14:15.455 --> 14:19.092
and I literally forgot
I had an entire rack of my wigs.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.093
My wigs are like my babies.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.427
And then when I got back home,

14:21.427 --> 14:24.864
I realized, oh, my God,
I left a bunch of wigs.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.899
They all thought you left hair
for real for them.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.901
I left that red one for Silky,

14:28.901 --> 14:32.638
and other than that,
those were all just by accident.

14:32.638 --> 14:33.639
Yeah.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.708
So I'm sure that's going to be--

14:35.708 --> 14:37.176
There's been some drama
about the hair.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.711
What happened with the hair?

14:38.711 --> 14:39.846
People were fighting over it.

14:39.846 --> 14:40.947
Are they all gone?

14:40.947 --> 14:42.381
Yeah. I don't know
where they are.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.183
Yeah.

14:44.183 --> 14:47.353
So I guess some of these queens

14:47.353 --> 14:49.655
thought that I left these wigs
behind for them.

14:49.655 --> 14:52.058
I love that they all flock
to them like flies on shit,

14:52.058 --> 14:53.292
but I want to know

14:53.292 --> 14:54.861
who the hell's
snatching up my damn wigs.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.063
So, Lucy, they got
some 'splaining to do.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.566
Well, it could be Bad Girls Club
Season 11, hello.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.437
Child, I need Ariel
to focus on the challenge,

15:04.437 --> 15:05.605
'cause I need a win.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.406
That's mine.
That's definitely mine.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.842
[Vanjie] She's looking
for her tumbleweeds

15:09.842 --> 15:12.612
that done went into
somebody else's station,

15:12.612 --> 15:14.280
and she's freaking
the fuck out.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.249
Aah, Lord, can I catch a break?

15:16.249 --> 15:18.618
Well, the Jersey
will come out. Hello.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.286
Oh, my God.

15:20.286 --> 15:23.856
[Shuga] Ariel, she's been
waiting to stir the pot.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.859
Get ready, honey.
It's about to blow up.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.496
I love that.

15:30.496 --> 15:34.167
This week's maxi challenge
is makeover time.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.670
We have to do one of these
eliminated girls

15:37.670 --> 15:38.971
in our drag style.

15:38.971 --> 15:41.107
Who this man, miss ?

15:41.107 --> 15:42.875
This is a full-on
dick magnet, honey.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.177
[A'Keria] Oh. [laughs]

15:44.177 --> 15:46.579
So I've got a really strong
concept for this.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.014
Okay.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.049
We're going to be actually
from the same denim tribe.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.217
Okay.

15:51.217 --> 15:53.553
I like the idea
of tribes and villages

15:53.553 --> 15:55.955
more than I do
a traditional drag family.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.057
It takes a village
to raise a queen.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.158
A lot of the other girls

15:59.158 --> 16:00.393
are going to serve
super-high glamour.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.828
Uh-huh.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.429
And even though I know you love
some super-high glamour--

16:03.429 --> 16:04.964
I do love my glamour.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.066
You're now going
to tap into the Odd-sizers.

16:07.066 --> 16:08.167
Yeah, I can get weird.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.169
These looks say
the House of Oddly

16:10.169 --> 16:14.373
in the way that they are
deconstructing a material.

16:14.373 --> 16:15.575
[Scarlet] Gorg.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.809
[Yvie]
I love the beauty of things

16:16.809 --> 16:19.779
that look like they're
just falling off of you.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.147
But the danger is

16:21.147 --> 16:24.884
I'm really just going to have
to fine-tune everything.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.488
Yes, something magical.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.457
-Yeah?
-Oh, ma'am, yeah.

16:31.457 --> 16:32.992
That's the Tee.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.861
[all laugh]

16:34.861 --> 16:36.762
Oh, my gosh.

16:36.762 --> 16:37.763
Jesus.

16:37.763 --> 16:41.133
She's back in the workroom.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.703
That's for sure.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.238
[Vanjie]
Hide your mirrors, girls.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.307
What the fuck is that?

16:48.307 --> 16:50.176
A winning look.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.944
[Shuga]
Yes, bitch, you betta.

16:51.944 --> 16:56.949
Yvie is, in her own odd way,
very high fashion.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.886
I'm very confident
in what Yvie and I

16:59.886 --> 17:01.854
are going to bring
as fashion girls.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.089
Yvie and I
are going to take this.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.591
Somebody give her a mirror,
darling.

17:05.591 --> 17:07.793
Yeah, it ain't working for me.

17:07.793 --> 17:11.464
But nice.
E for effort.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.968
I don't want you
to look like half-assed.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.937
I'd rather
you look the prettiest.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.272
I just need to excel,

17:19.272 --> 17:21.774
because I just came
fresh off the bottom again,

17:21.774 --> 17:24.677
and haven't had this wow moment
since the talk show,

17:24.677 --> 17:27.046
where the judges are like,
Miss Vanjie is here.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.714
And I want that
more than anything.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.285
I have to take it in from
the bottom to bring it up.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.153
Why don't you just put it
on the mannequin form?

17:34.153 --> 17:35.288
[Vanjie]
Because it's already darted,

17:35.288 --> 17:37.223
but I need to bring it in more.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.491
So I'm tailoring it to her body.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.326
I'm sewing it and making sure

17:40.326 --> 17:42.194
I make this dress
fit her like a glove.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.462
I want to make sure I do good,

17:43.462 --> 17:45.698
'cause I'm listening,
believe it or not.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.899
Oh, it fits you way better.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.671
Oh, you brought my doughnuts.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.105
Oh, yeah, I got them.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.942
You know, I used these
to sit down when I had my cyst.

17:55.942 --> 17:59.045
I was like
I could not sit on the hard,

17:59.045 --> 18:02.148
so I sat like this
because it was hurting so bad.

18:02.148 --> 18:05.718
What's the first thing
this bitch wanna talk about?

18:05.718 --> 18:07.286
Her goddamn cyst.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.555
I have a cyst.

18:09.555 --> 18:10.823
I'm currently oozing.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.695
Why did you bring it up
on the runway?

18:15.695 --> 18:18.431
Well, the judges were like
you're having a hard time.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.967
And I was like, yeah, I kinda
am having a hard time.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.202
Like, I'm literally leaking
as we're speaking.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.442
Now, another thing
is I don't wear big shoes,

18:29.442 --> 18:31.444
because I have tendonitis
so I can't wear high heels.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.212
[Silky] What kind of heels
you be wearing?

18:33.212 --> 18:36.849
I wear those, um,
basic grandma heels.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.485
But, you know, I just
call them sensible heels.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.888
If my tendonitis are really
really bad, then I wear flats.

18:42.888 --> 18:46.359
Child, now she's talking about
she's got tendonitis.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.762
The motherfucking challenge
is to put a drag queen--

18:49.762 --> 18:52.565
excuse me--
an experienced drag queen

18:52.565 --> 18:54.266
in motherfucking drag.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.569
Why do I feel like I'm about
to put somebody in drag

18:56.569 --> 18:58.604
for the first motherfucking time
in their life?

18:58.604 --> 19:00.573
I'm gonna see
if we can get a pair of shoes

19:00.573 --> 19:01.707
from this wall, honey.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.776
I mean, I can try it.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.878
You gonna learn today, honey,
because I ain't going home.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.147
You're gonna learn
how to walk in heels today.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.784
Oh, my God, I've never worn
heels like this high.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.854
Oh, no.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.957
Oh, my goodness.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.159
Bitch, oh, hell--
Go back. Uh-uh.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.094
You're walking like this, honey.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.163
[Vanjie] Girl,
she had on jelly slippers

19:24.163 --> 19:25.698
when she was on the runway.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.400
Aah. Call me out.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.101
Nobody could see them.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.904
I could not believe
you had on jelly slippers.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.539
[laughs]

19:33.539 --> 19:35.341
She looks like a Teletubby

19:35.341 --> 19:38.878
trying to strut
for the first time.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.480
I can't walk
in heels like these.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.382
[Vanjie] Wait, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.717
What heels
do you walk in, then?

19:44.717 --> 19:48.020
I walk in like very small heels.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.256
[Vanjie] Oh, my God.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.727
There is no words
to describe the gag that I'm--

19:54.727 --> 19:56.695
I'm at a state--
I've never been this gagged.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.297
Girl!

19:58.297 --> 20:00.132
And I thought
it was going to be halfway easy

20:00.132 --> 20:02.601
because we're making over drag
queens that already do this.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.970
How you gonna come
on Drag Race and not--

20:04.970 --> 20:07.807
and they weren't like--
they weren't like stilettos.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.209
They were like
a regular six-inch heel.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.478
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
[laughs]

20:12.478 --> 20:13.479
Oh.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.214
Yes.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.282
Listen, that walk.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.451
[laughs]

20:18.451 --> 20:21.620
Can we be like, you know,
like street?

20:21.620 --> 20:22.755
[Silky]
Bitch, get your baby shoes.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.890
Let's see
what you can do in those.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.193
Yeah, girl, this is a setup.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.698
Hey, twisted sisters.

20:32.698 --> 20:33.699
-Hey!
-Hey!

20:33.699 --> 20:35.801
It's a family reunion.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.603
[cheers]

20:37.603 --> 20:39.405
Question. Who brought
the potato salad?

20:39.405 --> 20:41.373
-Oh.
-Okay, good.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.811
The Davenports
are in the house.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.480
How are you related?
You're Texas, you're New York.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.349
Yes. Sahara Davenport
and Asia Davenport

20:50.349 --> 20:51.750
both left
and moved to New York City,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.119
which is how
I became a Davenport.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.154
Well, how different
are the New York Davenports

20:55.154 --> 20:56.655
from the Texas Davenports?

20:56.655 --> 20:58.090
[Honey]
It's completely different.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.559
It's definitely like more
of a pageant-y, pageant-y town.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.128
New York, like,
while we have pageants,

21:02.128 --> 21:06.165
it's more of a like fashion,
you know, kind of vibe.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.967
She don't know nothing
about that Texas drag just yet.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.603
I've gonna give her
a little A'Keria feel.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.872
-Yeah.
-That Chanel La Bella feel.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.840
Okay. This is
another design challenge.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.042
Your last design challenge
was not good for you.

21:17.042 --> 21:18.177
It was not.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.446
Of course,
I've got to redeem myself.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.381
I just want to make sure
that I embody

21:22.381 --> 21:23.949
what it is
that I have to do this time,

21:23.949 --> 21:27.253
because I want to make sure
Honey is a replica of A'Keria.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.021
[RuPaul] Who do you think's
in trouble here?

21:29.021 --> 21:30.923
Who do you think
is going to have a hard time

21:30.923 --> 21:34.426
relaying their
family resemblance?

21:34.426 --> 21:36.128
I'd probably have to say Silky.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.664
I would say hers
would probably be a challenge,

21:38.664 --> 21:39.899
because I know Soju

21:39.899 --> 21:41.467
really doesn't walk in heels,
number one.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.336
And also, I've never saw Silky
paint anybody else,

21:44.336 --> 21:45.905
and, you know,
mama kind of blind.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.606
[all laugh]

21:47.606 --> 21:50.009
Well, listen, I can't wait
to see the Davenports

21:50.009 --> 21:51.210
hit the runway.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.878
Good luck,
and we'll see you out there.

21:52.878 --> 21:54.547
-Thank you.
-All right.

21:54.547 --> 21:57.149
Brooke Lynn and Plastique.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.484
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi, Ru.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.718
Why'd you pick Plastique?

21:59.718 --> 22:01.787
Well, my walk on the runway
is something

22:01.787 --> 22:03.556
that's very important to me
and my aesthetic.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.090
And I knew she has a great walk,

22:05.090 --> 22:08.127
and she's around my height
and around my build,

22:08.127 --> 22:09.995
so I knew costuming
would be a lot easier.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.064
What is the family aesthetic?

22:12.064 --> 22:13.399
[Brooke Lynn]
We are pageant queens.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.601
The walk, the look,
the elegance, the poise.

22:15.601 --> 22:16.836
Mm-hmm.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.837
That's a huge part
of my family aesthetic.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.239
[RuPaul] Now, Brooke Lynn,

22:20.239 --> 22:22.875
did you have a strategy
in pairing the other girls?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.310
[Brooke Lynn] Not really.

22:24.310 --> 22:28.347
I was really looking at
the girls who had just come in

22:28.347 --> 22:29.682
and the girls
who were still here,

22:29.682 --> 22:31.483
and kind of seeing
who would work well together.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.852
Really, bitch?
I mean, Soju and Silky?

22:33.852 --> 22:36.222
[laughs] Well...

22:37.723 --> 22:40.025
What you mean to say
is, yeah, I'm a shady bitch.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.293
[laughs] I'm not.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.462
Honest, like,
Silky's a wonderful performer,

22:43.462 --> 22:45.464
but I think in terms of looks,

22:45.464 --> 22:46.632
I think putting her
with anybody,

22:46.632 --> 22:47.600
it would have been
a bit of a struggle.

22:50.302 --> 22:51.570
I'm a nice person.

22:51.570 --> 22:52.705
[RuPaul] All right.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.173
Well, give one for Toronto.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.641
-Thank you, Ru.
-Thanks.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.312
Silky and Soju.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.580
-Hi, Ru.
-Hey, baby.

23:01.580 --> 23:02.815
[RuPaul] Both from Chicago.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.384
Now, Silky, you won
two challenges so far.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.719
How are you going
to make a third?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.721
Ganache girls,
we are a look queen

23:08.721 --> 23:10.055
that moves around, honey.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.357
Okay.

23:11.357 --> 23:12.558
So I'm going to go
to what I love and enjoy,

23:12.558 --> 23:13.592
and that's disco.

23:13.592 --> 23:14.593
Ooh.

23:14.593 --> 23:15.861
We're gonna be two disco queens,

23:15.861 --> 23:18.197
and give, like,
our personality, our charm.

23:18.197 --> 23:21.133
I love that.
Now, last week, you were read

23:21.133 --> 23:23.602
because your padding
was visible.

23:23.602 --> 23:26.272
There were
several many complaints

23:26.272 --> 23:27.473
from the judges' table.

23:27.473 --> 23:28.941
I know.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.342
[Michelle]
Your jacket looked wrinkly.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.211
You could see the outlines
of your hip pads.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.179
Like, girl, we saw everything.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.749
How you gonna avoid
that same mistake?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.717
Um...

23:38.717 --> 23:40.119
The first thing I did
this morning

23:40.119 --> 23:42.221
was went to my pads
and I prayed.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.556
And I said, you're gonna work
for me this time, honey.

23:44.556 --> 23:46.892
Well, the pads worked.

23:46.892 --> 23:49.295
It was just that you
didn't have enough leggings on

23:49.295 --> 23:51.597
to covers up the ridges.

23:51.597 --> 23:55.200
I, um, still got to figure
that out, honey.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.269
I've been doing it in--

23:57.269 --> 23:59.238
It's not rocket science,
is it?

23:59.238 --> 24:00.472
I mean,
everybody wears pads.

24:00.472 --> 24:01.840
[Silky] Right.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.310
And we just wear enough tights
to smooth it out.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.011
-Okay.
-Uh, this--

24:06.011 --> 24:07.279
I got more pads.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.349
Okay, so in hindsight,
the mistake was what?

24:10.349 --> 24:12.151
My pads needed work,

24:12.151 --> 24:15.454
and whether that's gonna be
to add more layers on

24:15.454 --> 24:19.491
or to see if my pads inside
the thing was like just bumpy.

24:19.491 --> 24:20.859
It's a lot of things--

24:20.859 --> 24:24.396
Bitch, we could literally
see your pads on the runway.

24:24.396 --> 24:25.898
I know!

24:25.898 --> 24:29.068
And that was the first time
you have in this competition.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.169
I--

24:31.337 --> 24:33.005
You have no answer for me?
Really?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.239
Girl, let me tell you.

24:34.239 --> 24:37.443
This whole situation
got me like frazzled.

24:37.443 --> 24:39.845
Like it just don't
come to words.

24:41.180 --> 24:45.284
In the great words
of a wonderful singer...

24:45.284 --> 24:47.119
What singer?
Who are you gonna quote?

24:47.119 --> 24:48.354
[Silky] Girl,
I had the guy so frazzled,

24:48.354 --> 24:51.056
I couldn't even
get the lyrics out.

24:51.056 --> 24:52.191
[all laugh]

24:52.191 --> 24:54.693
In the fabulous words
of Bruno Mars,

24:54.693 --> 24:56.729
"Don't believe me, just watch."

24:56.729 --> 24:58.731
Huh.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.233
Now, Brooke Lynn
paired you with Soju.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.601
Do you think she's being shady?

25:02.601 --> 25:03.902
Do you think
she was helping you out?

25:03.902 --> 25:06.872
Um, you know what?

25:06.872 --> 25:09.541
I am very glad
that she put me with Soju,

25:09.541 --> 25:11.176
'cause I think
we both need redemption.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.146
Redemption from week one,
redemption for my pads.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.881
Yeah, yeah.

25:15.881 --> 25:18.150
Y'all know I'm a church lady
and a pageant queen,

25:18.150 --> 25:21.887
but, bitch, the true Tee is,
Miss Brooke Lynn,

25:21.887 --> 25:23.922
you done gave me
motherfucking Soju,

25:23.922 --> 25:26.225
the bitch
that can't walk in heels,

25:26.225 --> 25:28.527
still talking about
her motherfucking cyst,

25:28.527 --> 25:31.497
when you know I'm gonna
struggle bust my damn self.

25:31.497 --> 25:32.931
She done set me up.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.466
All right. So I can't wait
to see you out there.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.235
Strong family resemblance.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.836
-Get it, girls.
-Yeah.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.171
-All right, see you later.
-Thank you, Ru.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.208
-Hi, Nina.
-Hi, Ru.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.209
-Hi, Shuga.
-Hi, Ru.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.911
It seems like only yesterday.

25:45.911 --> 25:46.912
-Right?
-That you were here.

25:46.912 --> 25:48.180
I was saying the same thing.

25:48.180 --> 25:51.316
Nina, you won
the challenge last week.

25:51.316 --> 25:52.851
How are you going
to keep that momentum going?

25:52.851 --> 25:56.622
I'm just going
to continue to bring me,

25:56.622 --> 25:58.424
and what a great challenge
to bring me to, right,

25:58.424 --> 25:59.658
as the House of.

25:59.658 --> 26:00.959
Yeah. This is something
you do a lot of,

26:00.959 --> 26:03.962
You have 17 children
in your house?

26:03.962 --> 26:05.130
-House of West, yeah.
-House of West.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.565
My drag mother's Virginia West,

26:06.565 --> 26:08.200
and I have a bunch of daughters.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.770
What is the sort of creed
of the House of West

26:11.770 --> 26:13.772
that we'll see
on the main stage?

26:13.772 --> 26:16.041
Yeah, our drag family
is really charitable,

26:16.041 --> 26:18.210
and we're activists,
and that's the one thing

26:18.210 --> 26:20.112
that I'm really holding true to
in this challenge.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.047
So I see a rainbow dress there.

26:22.047 --> 26:23.315
Like the rainbow flag.

26:23.315 --> 26:24.416
The drag flag,
and then the trans flag.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.351
I really believe
in lifting people up,

26:26.351 --> 26:28.420
and I really believe
in celebrating all of us,

26:28.420 --> 26:29.955
because the second
one of us is pulled down,

26:29.955 --> 26:32.024
we're all pulled down.
-Oh, I love it.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.992
So can I see your outfit?
Let's see what you got there.

26:33.992 --> 26:36.395
So mine is a corset,
some shorts,

26:36.395 --> 26:38.030
and some fabulous boot covers.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.032
This is a little cute bodysuit
with the flag.

26:40.032 --> 26:43.268
Let me see.
It's got the transgender flag.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.404
And then it has
the boot covers as well.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.573
And this is really reflective
of kind of who we are.

26:47.573 --> 26:49.908
We're showgirls, and I'm
constantly inspired by theater.

26:49.908 --> 26:52.211
This is like kind of a wink
to Kinky Boots,

26:52.211 --> 26:55.247
but still something that's
very familiar to my world.

26:55.247 --> 26:58.150
All right. Well, I can't wait
to see y'all on the runway.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.718
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.689
I love the message,

27:03.689 --> 27:06.625
but do I feel like
they look circus-y?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.560
Mm.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.964
Are they cute? Mm-mm.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.339
[Soju] Your padding's
going to have to look right.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.642
Oh, girl, trust me.
I'm gonna prove a point, honey.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.110
That's one thing it will be:
right, honey.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.213
[Soju] Is it true
that you paint with sharpies?

27:28.213 --> 27:30.349
[Silky] I do my eyebrows
with a sharpie.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.984
Are you going to do my eyebrows
with a sharpie?

27:31.984 --> 27:34.586
[Silky] Yeah, sure.
Family resemblance, ho.

27:34.586 --> 27:37.823
[all laugh]

27:37.823 --> 27:40.559
You know, not every family
look the same.

27:40.559 --> 27:42.261
[laughs]

27:42.261 --> 27:44.196
Miss Soju, bitch, now
you ain't been here to know.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.564
I done won a few challenges

27:45.564 --> 27:47.366
and I got a lot of compliments
about my makeup.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.768
So that's one thing that
you ain't got to worry about.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.803
-I use my natural brows.
-I know.

27:51.803 --> 27:53.071
You gonna get
a little sharpie on them.

27:53.071 --> 27:54.406
-Okay.
-[laughs]

27:54.406 --> 27:55.941
[Vanjie] You better
count your blessings

27:55.941 --> 27:57.643
and hope that Silky don't put
no sharpie on your lips, too,

27:57.643 --> 27:59.044
'cause you know
she do that, too.

27:59.044 --> 28:00.345
[Soju] You do not put sharpie
on your lips.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.446
[Vanjie] Yes, girl,
yes, ma'am, honey.

28:01.446 --> 28:03.849
Wait. Does it erase
off your lips?

28:03.849 --> 28:05.384
Do I got it on my lips now?

28:05.384 --> 28:06.785
Do you do it every time?

28:06.785 --> 28:08.086
Every time.

28:08.086 --> 28:09.121
[laughs]

28:09.121 --> 28:10.589
Every time.

28:10.589 --> 28:12.291
And she's saying
like it ain't nothing.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.859
Like, yes, girl, what you mean?

28:13.859 --> 28:15.360
Like, girl,
you offended her, eh?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.728
Good God.

28:16.728 --> 28:20.532
How dare you, Miss Soju,
question my skills

28:20.532 --> 28:21.700
because I use
a permanent marker?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.735
I can beat a mug.

28:23.735 --> 28:27.306
Even when I'm at home, bitch,
I make some ho's beautiful.

28:27.306 --> 28:31.209
I mean, like, ho's that look
like Wesley Snipes,

28:31.209 --> 28:33.579
like John C. Reilly,

28:33.579 --> 28:35.347
ho's that look like Lil Wayne,

28:35.347 --> 28:38.016
and I make them ho's
look beautiful.

28:38.016 --> 28:41.219
It's an honor that I put
makeup on your face any day.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.487
[Vanjie]
Girl, you're gonna have

28:42.487 --> 28:43.922
a lot of cyst-tivity going on?

28:43.922 --> 28:45.357
[all laugh]

28:45.357 --> 28:48.026
All I'm gonna say is, bitch,
take care of you.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.461
You come first, cyst.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.063
[all laugh]

28:54.333 --> 28:55.734
Question.
When you walked in the room,

28:55.734 --> 28:57.970
is there anyone that you were
surprised was still here?

28:57.970 --> 28:58.971
Silky.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.339
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.140
Her personality is good enough
to get on the show,

29:02.140 --> 29:05.277
but I think that she's honestly
just in over her head.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.379
[Nina] Anyone else
you were surprised by?

29:07.379 --> 29:10.282
Vanjie, kind of.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.151
I mean, when Michelle told her

29:13.151 --> 29:15.954
"I know what you're gonna
wear on this runway

29:15.954 --> 29:18.123
before you even
come out on the runway,"

29:18.123 --> 29:20.592
I don't know
how you come back from that.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.096
So Miss Scarlet has some
opinions about Vanjie and Silky.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.098
Well, girl, what's the Tee,
Christine?

29:26.098 --> 29:27.499
Yeah, those are the two.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.402
And I honestly think that
those are the two to next go.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.437
But y'all know me.
I'm gonna call her out.

29:35.474 --> 29:36.475
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.076
Come on, cysts.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.045
Come on, cyst.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.781
Guess what we're doing today?
Makeovers.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.984
We gotta drag up
the eliminated ho's

29:45.984 --> 29:48.153
in our own drag styles.

29:48.153 --> 29:49.921
-Are you excited?
-I am excited.

29:49.921 --> 29:51.189
I can't wait to be a Hytes.

29:51.189 --> 29:53.659
Not only do we have
to make over these girls,

29:53.659 --> 29:55.360
but they can't touch themselves.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.397
I'm so nervous.
Make me a woman.

29:58.397 --> 29:59.731
I ain't no magician.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.299
[laugh]
You can do it.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.467
[Brooke Lynn]
They can't do their makeup.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.635
They can't touch their hair.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.970
Whatever we give them
is what they get.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.841
My face is going to be
bruised up by the end of this.

30:11.443 --> 30:14.479
All right, ladies and gents,
boys and girls.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.480
I have a question.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.882
[Yvie] Uh-oh.

30:16.882 --> 30:18.917
Y'all know I'm the girl
that likes to clear the air.

30:18.917 --> 30:21.553
What was said about
the whole wig situation?

30:21.553 --> 30:22.888
[Ariel] Oh, God, the wigs.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.958
Oh, it's about to be
some shit,

30:26.958 --> 30:29.227
and I'm not in it.
Thank God.

30:29.227 --> 30:30.562
So what's that Tee?

30:30.562 --> 30:32.698
You guys took all of
Ariel's wigs after she left?

30:32.698 --> 30:34.833
Now, bitch, you've been gone
from the very beginning.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.468
How you know all the Tee?

30:36.468 --> 30:37.936
[all laugh]

30:37.936 --> 30:39.871
What were you told?

30:39.871 --> 30:41.273
[Soju] That Ariel
left a lot of wigs.

30:41.273 --> 30:44.076
And it wasn't meant
for everyone to take it.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.744
Am I clearing out
the wig bullshit?

30:45.744 --> 30:48.380
Sure, you might as well,
since it's your wigs, baby.

30:48.380 --> 30:49.314
Go ahead.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.718
Well, all right.
So when I was packing,

30:52.718 --> 30:55.721
I left those wigs
all on that shelf by accident.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.457
And the only wig
that was actually left behind

30:58.457 --> 31:00.392
was that big old red wig
for Silky.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.694
-Uh-huh.
-And that was it.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.929
[Ariel] But I heard there
was a lot of shit, like--

31:03.929 --> 31:05.497
-Did you leave some for--
-Oh, this is for me.

31:05.497 --> 31:07.132
[A'Keria] Did you leave some
for your best friend?

31:08.700 --> 31:10.669
'Cause after we took the wigs,

31:10.669 --> 31:13.171
Plastique said that
the wigs were left for her

31:13.171 --> 31:14.973
because y'all
were best friends.

31:14.973 --> 31:17.609
She put all that hair
at my station.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.478
-Did she write you a note?
-No.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.213
But we were best friends.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.849
So we were trying
to get to the bottom of that

31:23.849 --> 31:26.985
and see what was actually the
truth with that whole situation.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.587
We squashed this.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.222
I made a comment.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.890
Apparently
we didn't all squash it.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.191
Because I did not care.

31:33.191 --> 31:34.593
But it was brought up
yesterday again,

31:34.593 --> 31:35.927
even though if it was squashed.
That was the thing.

31:35.927 --> 31:37.462
So that's why
I'm clearing the air now

31:37.462 --> 31:39.297
that the actual horses
are in the building.

31:39.297 --> 31:41.066
But, guys, the wigs--

31:41.066 --> 31:42.334
[A'Keria] So, Ariel,
are y'all best friends,

31:42.334 --> 31:43.869
and did you leave the wigs
for her?

31:43.869 --> 31:45.170
I mean, obviously

31:45.170 --> 31:46.605
I consider myself closest here
with Plastique.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.373
-We bonded a lot.
-Okay.

31:48.373 --> 31:49.775
But the wigs were left behind
by accident.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.276
But I just want to know
where the fuck they all are,

31:51.276 --> 31:53.645
because I don't see any of 'em.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.782
Okay, well, your black wig
and your purple wig

31:56.782 --> 31:58.016
is right there at my station.

31:58.016 --> 31:59.384
No, no, no. I don't care
about the purple wig.

31:59.384 --> 32:02.120
I know that Miss Ra'Jah
left with a bunch of them.

32:02.120 --> 32:05.190
Only wig I knew Ra'Jah had
was the big purple crinkly one.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.858
[Ariel] That's what
I'm pissed off about.

32:06.858 --> 32:09.361
All of a sudden, it's okay.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.029
She really just wants one wig,

32:11.029 --> 32:13.031
and it just so happens
to be from the person

32:13.031 --> 32:15.433
who is not in the workroom,
Miss Ra'Jah.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.402
[Silky]
But Ariel, I make it known.

32:17.402 --> 32:19.471
I did grab one or two more
because they was there.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.312
Ariel's silent
as a fucking mouse.

32:27.312 --> 32:29.347
So all that huffing and puffing,

32:29.347 --> 32:32.083
and now it's all like
a misunderstanding.

32:33.485 --> 32:34.753
[Shuga]
I did feel like, Ariel,

32:34.753 --> 32:35.687
you were a little more mad
about it yesterday

32:35.687 --> 32:37.088
than you are right now.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.256
[Shuga] That's what
I was going to say, too.

32:38.256 --> 32:41.893
Ariel was pissed,
and now she's very calm.

32:41.893 --> 32:42.994
[laughs]

32:42.994 --> 32:44.062
Yeah, legit,
you were saying like,

32:44.062 --> 32:45.397
I'm getting in there
and pop off,

32:45.397 --> 32:47.866
and then you ain't really
pop off just now.

32:47.866 --> 32:50.001
Okay, well, it's not like
the wigs are $5.00,

32:50.001 --> 32:53.138
so I fucking want
the wigs back obviously.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.106
So now as I'm addressing it,

32:55.106 --> 32:57.108
she's backpedaling and quits
popping all over the place.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.878
Say what you mean, mama,
and mean what you say.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.315
I got another question.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.583
Oh, God.

33:04.583 --> 33:08.420
I heard yesterday that
Scarlet was surprised

33:08.420 --> 33:11.323
Vanjie and Silky were still here
in this competition.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.490
Is that true?

33:12.490 --> 33:13.592
That is true.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.094
And what were you
surprised about?

33:16.094 --> 33:17.429
Now, before
I read your eyeballs out,

33:17.429 --> 33:19.264
go ahead and tell me why.

33:19.264 --> 33:21.533
Especially with Silky.
Come on, girl.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.969
Well, um...

33:23.969 --> 33:25.470
Well?

33:25.470 --> 33:27.138
Why, Miss Scarlet,

33:27.138 --> 33:29.841
you got my motherfucking name
in your mouth?

33:29.841 --> 33:32.077
The world wants to know
at this point.

33:32.077 --> 33:35.513
Because you've had the most
assistance from the other girls.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.250
You got to clear that up
for me, honey.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.553
Because in this competition,
as people have helped me,

33:41.553 --> 33:43.622
I have helped
every bitch in here, too.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.257
So what do you mean by that?

33:45.257 --> 33:47.392
It's the top six,
and I feel like--

33:47.392 --> 33:50.095
But, girl,
don't go around the issue.

33:50.095 --> 33:51.730
What have I had assistance with?

33:51.730 --> 33:54.132
Because I want to say
one thing to everybody.

33:54.132 --> 33:56.935
I have been nice
to every bitch up in here.

33:56.935 --> 33:58.837
And for y'all to run my name
through the mud,

33:58.837 --> 34:02.407
I have done mostly everything
for myself, so clear the air.

34:02.407 --> 34:04.276
Well, I do think

34:04.276 --> 34:07.345
that your runways are held
to a different standard.

34:07.345 --> 34:10.282
Bitch, your runways look worse
than mine, so clear the air.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.583
[Yvie] You guys act like

34:11.583 --> 34:13.818
if somebody has
a negative opinion about you,

34:13.818 --> 34:16.888
it means they goddamn hate you,
and that's not the Tee.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.157
Scarlet, I would never say this,

34:19.157 --> 34:20.525
but, you know,
you came for me a little bit,

34:20.525 --> 34:22.060
so I will say that
you should have went home

34:22.060 --> 34:23.895
the first time you lip synced
in that six-way.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.263
[Silky] You should have.

34:25.263 --> 34:26.431
[Vanjie]
Because I don't know

34:26.431 --> 34:27.599
how you're gonna come
to Drag Race

34:27.599 --> 34:28.600
and think
you're gonna survive a lip sync

34:28.600 --> 34:30.035
without knowing how to move.

34:30.035 --> 34:31.269
Yeah, I'm going tit fo tat.

34:31.269 --> 34:32.637
At this point
in the competition,

34:32.637 --> 34:34.439
the last thing I need

34:34.439 --> 34:36.107
is for people to be kicking me
while I'm down.

34:36.107 --> 34:37.309
So you gonna come for me,

34:37.309 --> 34:38.310
I'm gonna come for you
a little bit, too.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.811
[Silky] This is my thing.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.514
To come back here in this time
is a privilege and an honor.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.349
Had I come back,

34:44.349 --> 34:45.850
I wouldn't have said
a damn thing negative

34:45.850 --> 34:47.018
to any of you all.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.621
Bitch, you literally
just talked about

34:49.621 --> 34:51.222
how you thought Scarlet
should have been home

34:51.222 --> 34:52.958
after the first fucking dance.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.592
That's my opinion.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.461
-Exactly. Exactly.
-And that's her opinion.

34:56.461 --> 34:59.831
You need to stop taking
everything so personally.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.199
Well, I take
that shit personal,

35:01.199 --> 35:02.467
because when you say
everybody's helped me,

35:02.467 --> 35:03.768
how, Mary?

35:03.768 --> 35:05.270
All my shit is right here.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.005
None of this shit
is borrowed.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.073
Most of it I made.

35:08.073 --> 35:09.708
So how did people help me?

35:09.708 --> 35:10.942
Silky, you have been getting
a lot of help

35:10.942 --> 35:12.010
throughout the competition.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.244
But how?

35:13.244 --> 35:14.946
You and the rest
of your dream girls

35:14.946 --> 35:16.181
have all been there
for each other's back.

35:16.181 --> 35:18.416
So has Nina.
Nina's been getting help.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.820
It's the truth.

35:21.820 --> 35:26.224
Silky has had the help
of the dream girls all season.

35:26.224 --> 35:27.625
And I'm not saying
it's a bad thing

35:27.625 --> 35:28.960
to have help from your sisters,

35:28.960 --> 35:30.528
but Scarlet's not wrong
in saying

35:30.528 --> 35:34.165
that Silky hasn't done
all of this by herself.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.768
This bitch can't even say what
anybody has ever done for me.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.069
Bitch.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.738
[Silky] Say what somebody
has done for me

35:39.738 --> 35:41.239
in this competition
other than them.

35:41.239 --> 35:43.241
Okay, your hair.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.043
Your hair, for starters.

35:45.043 --> 35:47.379
You went to half of the girls
for sewing this and sewing that.

35:47.379 --> 35:50.181
That is not true.
I sew everything of my own.

35:50.181 --> 35:52.117
Yeah, we have the dream girls.

35:52.117 --> 35:54.486
But what they give me
more so than anything

35:54.486 --> 35:55.820
is emotional support

35:55.820 --> 35:58.656
for bitches like that
who say shit about me.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.458
Fuck.

36:00.458 --> 36:01.793
[Shuga] Y'all are crazy.

36:01.793 --> 36:02.927
You'll be fighting this
to the death, honey.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.430
It's just an opinion, girl.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.865
You can't get
so pressed about it.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.000
And I just
answered the question.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.168
No, you just got super salty

36:10.168 --> 36:12.103
'cause a bitch
put your name out.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.339
I did.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.342
Look, everyone has opinions.
Scarlet had an opinion.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.778
Why are you offended, and why
you jumping down her throat?

36:19.778 --> 36:20.779
Goddamn.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.614
Scarlet's just hating.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.582
That's it, that's all.

36:24.582 --> 36:27.285
Y'all look like some
salty maltese up in here.

36:27.285 --> 36:28.820
So I'm a salty malty today.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.256
Well, I'll be a salty malty,
so you can be a pressed panini.

36:31.256 --> 36:33.191
Opinions are like assholes,
you know.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.093
Most of them are on my face.

36:35.093 --> 36:36.127
[Vanjie laughs]

36:45.537 --> 36:48.106

37:04.923 --> 37:09.794
Michelle Visage, six of
the eliminated queens are back.

37:09.794 --> 37:11.362
Security.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.631
[all laugh]

37:13.631 --> 37:15.533
And the hilarious Ross Mathews.

37:15.533 --> 37:17.936
Now, what's different
about you today?

37:17.936 --> 37:19.137
Oh, you noticed.

37:19.137 --> 37:20.739
Michelle did my makeup.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.974

37:22.974 --> 37:26.444

37:29.581 --> 37:31.883
Oh, yes, honey,
and, bitch, I'm from Chicago.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.218
[all laugh]

37:33.218 --> 37:35.253

37:40.759 --> 37:43.128
Girl, I have loved you
since Pootie Tang.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.063
Well, I didn't know
you smoked weed.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.098
[all laugh]

37:47.098 --> 37:50.168
Now, how is your
Oh, Well tour going?

37:50.168 --> 37:52.737
-Oh, well.
-[laughs]

37:52.737 --> 37:55.106
Now, this week,
we challenged our queens

37:55.106 --> 37:57.642
to make over
their twisted sisters.

37:57.642 --> 38:02.480
And tonight on the runway,
category is Drag Family Values.

38:02.480 --> 38:07.218
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

38:10.054 --> 38:13.124
♪ We got a mighty love ♪

38:13.124 --> 38:17.562
[RuPaul] First up,
Yvie Oddly and Scarlet Envy.

38:17.562 --> 38:20.131
Oh, my God, this place
is crawling with drag queens.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.500
[Ross] Clearly they're sisters.
They have the same jeans.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.002
[all laugh]

38:24.002 --> 38:25.703
[Lena]
Occidental fingernails.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.806
[Wanda] I just remembered.
I gotta get my car washed.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.507
[all laugh]

38:29.507 --> 38:30.842
[Yvie]
The outfit Scarlet is wearing

38:30.842 --> 38:33.444
is actually the first outfit
I've ever made.

38:33.444 --> 38:37.081
And then I'm modeling
a more recent redo of it

38:37.081 --> 38:40.318
because I want to show the
judges I can do some elevation.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.253
And these wigs are literally

38:42.253 --> 38:45.657
every pair of jeans I had,
so... [laughs]

38:45.657 --> 38:48.193
Scarlet is really
selling this fantasy.

38:48.193 --> 38:51.896
She's got my denim back like
she's my real denim sister.

38:51.896 --> 38:54.532
This is as odd as it gets.
[laughs]

38:54.532 --> 38:55.967
[evil laugh]

38:55.967 --> 38:58.636
[both laugh]

39:03.174 --> 39:04.175
That was LOL.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.810
[all laugh]

39:05.810 --> 39:07.345
You know,
this is the same designer

39:07.345 --> 39:09.280
who made Justin Timberlake
and Britney Spears outfit.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.515
-Yes.
-Yeah.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.916
[RuPaul laughs]

39:11.916 --> 39:14.953
Up next,
Nina West and Shuga Cain.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.221
[Michelle]
The insane drag posse.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.589
[all laugh]

39:17.589 --> 39:18.590
[Lena] It's like Skittles
and Chiclets.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.091
[all laugh]

39:20.091 --> 39:22.060
[RuPaul] You know, these
outfits fit them to an LGBT.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.495
[all laugh]

39:24.495 --> 39:27.732
[Nina] I really wanted
to use this runway walk

39:27.732 --> 39:29.067
as our very own pride parade.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.436
These outfits
are quintessential Nina.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.471
They're inspired
by Kinky Boots from Broadway,

39:33.471 --> 39:34.906
so they're very fun,

39:34.906 --> 39:36.841
but there's also
a message behind it.

39:36.841 --> 39:38.877
And Shuga
is making me so proud.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.246
She's doing her best
Nina West impression,

39:41.246 --> 39:43.548
which is really amazing.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.516
She's serving
and turning on the runway.

39:45.516 --> 39:46.985
[Lena]
I love a gay superhero.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.453
-Amen.
-Come on, Kay.

39:48.453 --> 39:49.854
[Wanda]
One of the twins disappears.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.589
[all laugh]

39:51.589 --> 39:53.825
[RuPaul]
Next, A'Keria C. Davenport

39:53.825 --> 39:57.061
and her sis, Honey Davenport.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.998
[Lena] Yellow and orange
make fabulous.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.165
[Ross] Gorg.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.668
[Lena]
Melon-ated Marilyn Monroe.

40:03.668 --> 40:06.471
[A'Keria] I'm giving you
very Davenport style

40:06.471 --> 40:08.573
high fashion eleganza.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.941
I'm wearing a keyhole

40:09.941 --> 40:12.677
with the jewels that sit
almost to my breast,

40:12.677 --> 40:14.178
and my sister Honey,
she has on

40:14.178 --> 40:15.580
a little old piece of ruffle

40:15.580 --> 40:17.582
covering up
all those man muscles.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.218
And of course, gotta have on
some Texas hair, baby.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.787
This makeover
is definitely a success

40:22.787 --> 40:24.289
We know we the Tee, baby.

40:24.289 --> 40:27.325
[RuPaul] The Landers sisters
are still going strong.

40:29.227 --> 40:30.428
[Wanda]
So slow, though.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.563
Like The Real Housewives
of Molasses.

40:32.563 --> 40:35.366
[all laugh]

40:35.366 --> 40:40.004
[RuPaul] Up next, Dr. Reverend
Silky Nutmeg Ganache,

40:40.004 --> 40:41.906
and her sister Soju.

40:41.906 --> 40:43.608
[Lena] Studio 69.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.677
[all laugh]

40:45.677 --> 40:48.146
[RuPaul] Remember when Nell
Carter was on The Cher Show?

40:48.146 --> 40:50.181
[Michelle] Yes.
[all laugh]

40:50.181 --> 40:51.649
My favorite episode.

40:51.649 --> 40:54.786
[Silky] The Ganache family
is going to the disco.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.955
I have my sister, Miss Soju,

40:56.955 --> 41:01.159
wearing a full bodysuit
that shows all her curves.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.894
Her bell bottoms are pointed

41:02.894 --> 41:05.196
to show a little bit
more character,

41:05.196 --> 41:06.664
and so you can get a sneak peek

41:06.664 --> 41:08.833
that that bitch is actually
wearing heels, baby.

41:08.833 --> 41:11.035
[RuPaul]
All right, sister Soju.

41:11.035 --> 41:12.337
[all laugh]

41:12.337 --> 41:14.372
[Silky] And I'm wearing
a jumpsuit

41:14.372 --> 41:16.741
with my bell bottoms
on the sleeves, honey.

41:16.741 --> 41:19.043
I got a little belt to give you
a little more shape,

41:19.043 --> 41:20.945
a little bit more curve.

41:20.945 --> 41:24.415
We on this runway showing shape
and eating grapes, honey.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.684
And we're waiting
on the after party.

41:26.684 --> 41:29.220
The pads are messy again.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.789
[Lena]
Cagney and Lacey.

41:31.789 --> 41:33.424
[Ross] Gag-me and Lacey.

41:33.424 --> 41:34.993
[all laugh]

41:34.993 --> 41:39.030
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo
and Ariel Versace.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.065
-Ooh.
-Nice reveal.

41:41.065 --> 41:43.568
[RuPaul] Two little girls
from Glitter Rock.

41:43.568 --> 41:45.103
[all laugh]

41:45.103 --> 41:46.804
[Ross] I feel awful.
I can never remember.

41:46.804 --> 41:48.306
Which one's Tia,
which one's Tamera?

41:48.306 --> 41:50.274
[all laugh]

41:50.274 --> 41:54.645
[Vanjie] Tonight on the menu
is the Mateo Vanjie takeover.

41:54.645 --> 41:57.281
Me and Ariel are pumping down
the runway Miss Vanjie style.

41:57.281 --> 42:00.918
Looking disco
extra-greasy shortening.

42:00.918 --> 42:02.353
Blonde waved hair,

42:02.353 --> 42:05.690
bombshells down
with a good old breast sequin.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.525
Very sparkle, bling, bling.

42:07.525 --> 42:11.529
We got disco pants on me,
a beautiful gown on Ariel.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.731
I'm looking sickening,
she's looking fierce,

42:13.731 --> 42:14.866
and I'm living for it.

42:14.866 --> 42:17.001
[both] Miss Vanjie.

42:17.001 --> 42:19.904
Miss Vanjie.
-Uh-huh.

42:19.904 --> 42:22.106
[both] Miss Vanjie.

42:22.106 --> 42:23.808
[all laugh]

42:23.808 --> 42:27.345
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes
and Plastique Tiara.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.580
[Michelle] Whatever they have,
I think it's spreading.

42:29.580 --> 42:30.782
[all laugh]

42:30.782 --> 42:31.883
[Lena]
Somebody call the gardener.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.284
[all laugh]

42:33.284 --> 42:34.552
[Michelle] Some bushes
need to be whacked.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.987
[all laugh]

42:35.987 --> 42:38.189
[Brooke Lynn] This week,
the Hytes family legacy

42:38.189 --> 42:39.424
is being carried on

42:39.424 --> 42:42.260
with my new drag sister
Harlem Hytes.

42:42.260 --> 42:45.196
We are serving you
classic Hytes pageant glamour,

42:45.196 --> 42:48.599
with a lovely velvet gown
with sequin appliques,

42:48.599 --> 42:51.102
1940s movie star hair,

42:51.102 --> 42:53.805
looking unbothered
sauntering down the runway.

42:53.805 --> 42:56.441
The concept is very like
pageant-y evening gown walk

42:56.441 --> 42:57.975
with floating and some dance.

42:57.975 --> 43:00.645
I just wanted to be very
graceful and beautiful.

43:00.645 --> 43:02.313
[laughs]

43:02.313 --> 43:05.249
I taught Plastique a couple
Hytes evening gown moves:

43:05.249 --> 43:06.984
kick the train, you do
a little rond de jambe

43:06.984 --> 43:08.753
and the train kind of
flows in front of you.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.755
I want her to take her time

43:10.755 --> 43:13.458
to just really move her hips
and let the light bathe you.

43:13.458 --> 43:14.859
Alyssa Edwards
better watch out.

43:14.859 --> 43:16.661
She might have a daughter
jumping ship.

43:16.661 --> 43:18.429
[Lena]
There she is, Miss America.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.431
[Ross] I just feel bad
for the ugly sister.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.666
[all laugh]

43:24.235 --> 43:25.470
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

43:25.470 --> 43:28.739
It's time for
the judges' critiques.

43:28.739 --> 43:31.142
First up, Yvie Oddly.

43:31.142 --> 43:32.810
I thought it was really fun
when you guys came out.

43:32.810 --> 43:34.278
Obviously you guys
are rock stars.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.813
I thought the look
was really great, you know,

43:35.813 --> 43:38.983
feeling a bit of an Ursula denim
situation happening,

43:38.983 --> 43:41.352
and I loved watching you guys.

43:41.352 --> 43:44.388
What I'm struggling with
is the construction of this.

43:44.388 --> 43:48.392
It's almost chic in
a futuristic almost kinda way,

43:48.392 --> 43:50.828
but it just looks
a little crafty.

43:50.828 --> 43:53.531
[Wanda] I mean,
I buy that you're sisters,

43:53.531 --> 43:56.300
except that it's like the little
sister trying to tag along.

43:56.300 --> 44:00.872
And you're giving her
your scraps of your scraps.

44:00.872 --> 44:03.574
This is the best that
my sisters have ever gotten.

44:03.574 --> 44:05.643
[all laugh]
Right, right.

44:05.643 --> 44:09.046
Up next, Nina West.

44:09.046 --> 44:11.215
-Hi, Shuga.
-Hi, Ru.

44:11.215 --> 44:13.351
Well, look, I know all about
wearing a rainbow, okay.

44:13.351 --> 44:15.620
[all laugh]

44:15.620 --> 44:17.955
I wear my pride
on my sleeve a lot,

44:17.955 --> 44:20.091
so I appreciated
that you guys did that tonight.

44:20.091 --> 44:22.827
You know, we have the rainbow
and you have the trans flag,

44:22.827 --> 44:24.495
but really we're sisters.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.364
So I got the message,
and I loved it.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.766
But I feel like
Shuga's lost in this.

44:28.766 --> 44:33.271
The hairdo, mm, mm.
And Shuga's makeup.

44:33.271 --> 44:35.072
I just know
how beautiful Shuga is and...

44:36.541 --> 44:37.742
-Okay.
-You know.

44:37.742 --> 44:39.210
And I can imagine
how hard it was

44:39.210 --> 44:42.213
for all of you queens to have
another queen do your face

44:42.213 --> 44:43.614
when you can't do a thing.

44:43.614 --> 44:47.518
Unfortunately, Shuga,
it's almost bordering on clowny.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.387
And you're--
Fashion should say something,

44:49.387 --> 44:50.655
and you're certainly
saying something

44:50.655 --> 44:51.956
on the runway tonight.

44:51.956 --> 44:53.291
The issue is this.

44:53.291 --> 44:56.027
These look like costumes
for a pride parade,

44:56.027 --> 44:57.895
not fashiony for a runway.

44:57.895 --> 44:59.997
There's just certain boxes
you have to check

44:59.997 --> 45:01.832
in this challenge.

45:01.832 --> 45:06.971
Up next, A'Keria C. Davenport
and her sister Honey.

45:06.971 --> 45:08.673
-Hey.
-Hey.

45:08.673 --> 45:10.174
I buy that you're sisters.

45:10.174 --> 45:14.745
It's very pageantry in
a Vanessa Williams kind of way.

45:14.745 --> 45:15.813
[all laugh]

45:15.813 --> 45:16.914
The hair's the same color,

45:16.914 --> 45:18.716
styled similarly, but different.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.484
You painted her beautifully,

45:20.484 --> 45:22.687
and I like what you did
with the keyhole.

45:22.687 --> 45:24.322
I have an affinity for it.

45:24.322 --> 45:28.125
There's just a lot that's
simple but effective here.

45:28.125 --> 45:30.528
And I love this kind
of pageant drag.

45:30.528 --> 45:33.764
You're not reinventing the wheel
with this,

45:33.764 --> 45:36.267
but sometimes the wheel's
just fine as it is.

45:36.267 --> 45:40.538
Up next, the Dr. Reverend
Silky Nutmeg Ganache

45:40.538 --> 45:42.139
and Soju.

45:42.139 --> 45:44.175
-Hi, Soju.
-Hi.

45:44.175 --> 45:45.209
I missed you.

45:45.209 --> 45:48.346
I have to ask you,
how is the cyst?

45:48.346 --> 45:50.548
Haven't had any complaint, Ross.
Haven't had any complaints.

45:50.548 --> 45:51.682
[all laugh]

45:51.682 --> 45:53.184
I thought you guys
were a lot of fun.

45:53.184 --> 45:54.785
I really liked
the seventies of it all.

45:54.785 --> 45:56.320
That's my favorite era.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.156
But I do think there's
something about the costuming

45:59.156 --> 46:01.559
that felt
a little bit too Halloween.

46:01.559 --> 46:03.327
[Wanda]
I agree with Lena.

46:03.327 --> 46:06.597
I mean, it was more of a theme
instead of sisters.

46:06.597 --> 46:10.201
It's like somebody threw
Sonny and Cher in a blender

46:10.201 --> 46:12.136
and threw in a Jackson Five,

46:12.136 --> 46:15.740
and this is what,
you know, what we have.

46:15.740 --> 46:17.241
I made all of this.

46:17.241 --> 46:19.110
Probably the only queen
that made both looks.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.511
I just wanted to showcase Soju.

46:20.511 --> 46:23.047
Soju was the first one
to go home,

46:23.047 --> 46:25.449
and I wanted her to come out
in a different light

46:25.449 --> 46:27.718
and to be beautiful.

46:27.718 --> 46:29.286
But I'm going to call you out
again, Silky,

46:29.286 --> 46:32.890
'cause your makeup is gorgeous,
Soju's a little rough.

46:32.890 --> 46:34.792
That cheek is very heavy.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.594
Looks like it was blended
with a Dremel.

46:36.594 --> 46:40.831
And I see issues with your
padding again in the back.

46:40.831 --> 46:43.534
Also, I didn't feel like
I was looking at the Silky

46:43.534 --> 46:45.236
I've come to know and love.

46:45.236 --> 46:47.738
It felt like you kept
like looking over at Soju

46:47.738 --> 46:48.939
and being like,
oh, that's right,

46:48.939 --> 46:49.874
I'm supposed to go
like this now.

46:49.874 --> 46:51.275
You felt a little lost to me.

46:51.275 --> 46:54.812
I know that I can go
like at a thousand

46:54.812 --> 46:56.380
and leave my partner behind.
-Uh-huh.

46:56.380 --> 46:59.150
And so tonight I wanted to
bring it down a few notches.

46:59.150 --> 47:02.453
But unfortunately I guess
I brought it down too much.

47:04.522 --> 47:08.826
Up next, Miss Vanjie
and her sister Ariel Versace.

47:08.826 --> 47:11.462
You made me so proud tonight.

47:11.462 --> 47:13.597
-Ariel...
-Hi.

47:13.597 --> 47:15.700
She absolutely
looks like your sister.

47:15.700 --> 47:17.401
She looks better than me.
I was like...

47:17.401 --> 47:18.869
[Ariel laughs]
She took a lot of time

47:18.869 --> 47:21.806
to like really tailor this dress
in to like perfectly fit me

47:21.806 --> 47:24.775
and put a lot of detail
into everything.

47:24.775 --> 47:25.976
I didn't pay her
to say that, either.

47:25.976 --> 47:28.112
Y'all came out
and dropped those coats,

47:28.112 --> 47:29.980
and it was just stunning.

47:29.980 --> 47:33.551
Truly. It was very
Beyoncé-esque. It was good.

47:33.551 --> 47:37.922
And what I love about this
is how well executed it is.

47:37.922 --> 47:39.657
It's so smart to put
one of you in a dress

47:39.657 --> 47:40.858
and one of you in pants.

47:40.858 --> 47:41.926
It's so good.

47:45.496 --> 47:48.132
I just really wanted
to make you guys proud.

47:48.132 --> 47:51.068
It was getting frustrating.

47:53.938 --> 47:55.906
Up next,
it's Brooke Lynn Hytes

47:55.906 --> 47:58.342
and her sister Plastique.

47:58.342 --> 47:59.944
Silky, this is a great example.

47:59.944 --> 48:03.347
So we have an Asian sister,
and though we're not twins,

48:03.347 --> 48:05.149
you can tell there's
a family resemblance.

48:05.149 --> 48:07.485
And what I also liked
about the performance tonight,

48:07.485 --> 48:09.553
you told a story out there.

48:09.553 --> 48:11.589
When Plastique
stepped in front of you

48:11.589 --> 48:14.525
and there was a look--
no, no, no--

48:14.525 --> 48:15.693
it was so funny.

48:15.693 --> 48:17.461
[Lena] It was so classic.

48:17.461 --> 48:20.097
It was so beautifully done.
It was fantastic.

48:20.097 --> 48:21.966
You took my breath away
when you guys walked out.

48:24.001 --> 48:25.402
[Brooke Lynn] Sorry.

48:25.402 --> 48:28.406
I'm just really happy
the story came across,

48:28.406 --> 48:30.741
'cause this was kind of
a love letter to my drag mother,

48:30.741 --> 48:32.943
because she taught me
everything I know,

48:32.943 --> 48:35.379
and she's the reason
I'm here today.

48:35.379 --> 48:37.748
So it just really means
a lot to me that you got it.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.750
So thank you.

48:39.750 --> 48:40.885
Whoo.

48:40.885 --> 48:43.587
All right, ladies.
One more question.

48:43.587 --> 48:46.157
Who should go home tonight...

48:48.459 --> 48:50.194
and why?

48:50.194 --> 48:53.297
Start with Yvie Oddly.

48:57.001 --> 48:59.203
Silky is the one girl

48:59.203 --> 49:01.872
who's gotten the same critiques
a few times,

49:01.872 --> 49:03.374
and hasn't ever polished out

49:03.374 --> 49:05.743
the things that
you want to see from her.

49:05.743 --> 49:07.978
Scarlet Envy.

49:07.978 --> 49:09.647
Well, it came out
in the workroom today,

49:09.647 --> 49:13.384
so Silky knows, I guess,
already.

49:13.384 --> 49:14.518
Nina West.

49:14.518 --> 49:15.920
Based on her critique tonight,

49:15.920 --> 49:18.522
I'm going to have to say
Yvie Oddly.

49:18.522 --> 49:19.523
Shuga.

49:19.523 --> 49:20.858
Unfortunately, Silky.

49:20.858 --> 49:24.461
Just because the critiques
that you've given her

49:24.461 --> 49:26.730
you've given her before,
and today was an opportunity

49:26.730 --> 49:29.300
for her to really pay attention
to those and execute,

49:29.300 --> 49:31.202
and it didn't happen.

49:31.202 --> 49:32.269
A'Keria.

49:32.269 --> 49:33.737
I'm gonna have to say Yvie,

49:33.737 --> 49:36.640
and that's based on
overall growth.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.310
At this point
it should be only elevation.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.779
Honey Davenport.

49:41.779 --> 49:44.715
Silky's outfit was the least
polished on the runway tonight.

49:46.417 --> 49:47.852
Silky.

49:47.852 --> 49:49.186
I would choose Yvie.

49:49.186 --> 49:51.655
As America's
next drag superstar,

49:51.655 --> 49:54.058
you have to be kind to people,

49:54.058 --> 49:58.395
and she has not been
the most kind or the most nice.

49:58.395 --> 49:59.396
Soju.

49:59.396 --> 50:01.232
I would also have to Yvie,

50:01.232 --> 50:02.967
because I don't think her drag

50:02.967 --> 50:06.370
is on the level
of everyone else in the top six.

50:08.839 --> 50:09.907
Vanjie.

50:09.907 --> 50:11.976
Based on tonight,
I would say Yvie.

50:11.976 --> 50:13.444
Just because I feel like

50:13.444 --> 50:15.880
she kind of left her sister
a little behind.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.948
Ariel.

50:17.948 --> 50:19.183
I would also have to say Silky,

50:19.183 --> 50:22.019
just based off the critiques.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.954
-Brooke Lynn.
-I would have to say Silky.

50:23.954 --> 50:26.223
I just didn't think
the look was finished,

50:26.223 --> 50:29.326
and I just don't think there
was a great family resemblance.

50:29.326 --> 50:30.527
Plastique.

50:30.527 --> 50:33.230
I agree.
Silky just fell short.

50:33.230 --> 50:35.666
Thank you
for your honesty, ladies.

50:35.666 --> 50:38.903
Now, while you
untuck backstage,

50:38.903 --> 50:40.704
the judges and I
will deliberate.

50:42.473 --> 50:44.942
All right, now just between
us squirrel friends,

50:44.942 --> 50:47.144
what do you think?

50:47.144 --> 50:48.879
Let's start with Yvie Oddly.

50:48.879 --> 50:50.681
Yvie is an original.

50:50.681 --> 50:52.950
That is the toughest thing
to do in show business.

50:52.950 --> 50:55.019
-Don't I know it.
-[laughs]

50:55.019 --> 50:57.187
And when I look at this outfit
from way back here,

50:57.187 --> 51:00.958
I go, yeah,
that's an Yvie Oddly look.

51:00.958 --> 51:02.860
The problem is
when you get a little close.

51:02.860 --> 51:04.528
[laughs]

51:04.528 --> 51:08.065
It looks like she put
a lot of time in her outfit--

51:08.065 --> 51:09.266
well, I mean, the scraps.

51:09.266 --> 51:10.668
But she put some time into 'em.

51:10.668 --> 51:14.138
But it's just like some
hand-me-down for her sister

51:14.138 --> 51:17.207
and told her to just
bring a pair of shoes.

51:17.207 --> 51:18.542
[Michelle]
Crystal shoes with that

51:18.542 --> 51:20.744
was not as good
as the denim shoe with that,

51:20.744 --> 51:22.813
which seems like little,
but at this point, it's not.

51:22.813 --> 51:24.782
[RuPaul] Up next, Nina West.

51:24.782 --> 51:27.985
I love a rainbow look,
but it can be hit or miss.

51:27.985 --> 51:30.287
[Michelle] I mean,
she was wearing bike shorts.

51:30.287 --> 51:31.488
[chuckles]

51:31.488 --> 51:33.857
That she used her time
on this runway

51:33.857 --> 51:36.927
to make that kind of statement
is gorgeous.

51:36.927 --> 51:38.495
Unfortunately,
the outfits weren't.

51:38.495 --> 51:41.465
And whilst I appreciate
so greatly

51:41.465 --> 51:43.233
the rainbow flag
and the trans flag

51:43.233 --> 51:45.636
coming together as a statement,

51:45.636 --> 51:46.904
at the end of the day,

51:46.904 --> 51:49.373
this is a drag family
resemblance challenge,

51:49.373 --> 51:51.375
and there was no resemblance.

51:51.375 --> 51:54.178
[RuPaul]
A'Keria C. Davenport.

51:54.178 --> 51:56.547
Those two sold it,
and they looked beautiful.

51:56.547 --> 51:58.415
I think it kept true
to a Davenport.

51:58.415 --> 51:59.750
They got it right.

51:59.750 --> 52:00.985
[RuPaul] The color scheme
was beautiful.

52:00.985 --> 52:03.654
They looked like
they were from the same house.

52:03.654 --> 52:05.622
In fact, I think Honey
has never looked better.

52:05.622 --> 52:07.691
That's really not Honey's style.

52:07.691 --> 52:09.259
She's a New York
sort of edgy queen.

52:09.259 --> 52:11.061
I told them
they didn't reinvent the wheel,

52:11.061 --> 52:12.830
but there's nothing wrong
with the wheel.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.198
You know, it's round, it works.

52:14.198 --> 52:15.265
You know,
if it ain't broke--

52:15.265 --> 52:16.367
-Put a wig on it.
-Exactly.

52:16.367 --> 52:18.002
[all laugh]

52:18.002 --> 52:22.239
The Dr. Reverend
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

52:22.239 --> 52:23.807
I think we should call Issa Rae,

52:23.807 --> 52:25.642
because that whole thing
was a little insecure for me.

52:25.642 --> 52:28.012
[all laugh]

52:28.012 --> 52:31.782
I didn't like that she tried
to use Soju as an excuse.

52:31.782 --> 52:34.852
She said, well, I had to
bring it down to help Soju out.

52:34.852 --> 52:36.553
She didn't need to do that.
Soju's red hot.

52:36.553 --> 52:39.890
Nope, sorry, that's her cyst.
[laughs]

52:39.890 --> 52:42.159
Tonight, Silky had some issues.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.361
She was looking a bit lumpy.

52:44.361 --> 52:45.896
The outfits
were a bit tattered,

52:45.896 --> 52:47.631
and I felt like there was
no family resemblance.

52:47.631 --> 52:49.633
These were two girlfriends
going out to a disco.

52:49.633 --> 52:51.235
[Ross] I love Silky.

52:51.235 --> 52:53.704
I think she has what it takes
to get to the finish line.

52:53.704 --> 52:56.073
I just hope
she's not running out of gas,

52:56.073 --> 52:57.674
'cause it kind of
feels that way.

52:57.674 --> 52:59.143
[RuPaul] Miss Vanjie.

52:59.143 --> 53:02.179
I think they just came out
with such confidence and swag

53:02.179 --> 53:04.515
that we were immediately
won over.

53:04.515 --> 53:06.450
[Wanda] They were
just gorgeous, stunning.

53:06.450 --> 53:07.851
I bought the whole thing.

53:07.851 --> 53:11.522
Loved the whole
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes look

53:11.522 --> 53:13.290
that Marilyn
and Jane Russell had.

53:13.290 --> 53:14.625
[Michelle]
Everything was on point.

53:14.625 --> 53:15.959
The way they were walking.

53:15.959 --> 53:17.795
The way that she did Ariel
was beautiful.

53:17.795 --> 53:19.229
[Ross]
I warned all the queens

53:19.229 --> 53:22.433
use every tool in your toolbelt
before it's too late,

53:22.433 --> 53:23.934
and Vanjie this week,

53:23.934 --> 53:27.071
she pulled out a hammer
and a wrench and a screwdriver,

53:27.071 --> 53:28.739
and that's all the tools I know.

53:28.739 --> 53:30.841

53:35.412 --> 53:37.681
Listen, what they did tonight
was classic Brooke Lynn,

53:37.681 --> 53:38.882
and it worked.

53:38.882 --> 53:41.518
There's no edge
to what she's bringing,

53:41.518 --> 53:42.719
which is the one thing

53:42.719 --> 53:43.854
that I'm sort of missing
from Brooke Lynn.

is so well done.

53:46.690 --> 53:48.158
You can't deny it.

53:48.158 --> 53:50.727
And I really liked
the story behind it.

53:50.727 --> 53:52.930
There was meaning to it.

53:52.930 --> 53:55.199
She didn't just pull something
out of her ass.

53:55.199 --> 53:56.967
She really wanted
to tell a story.

53:56.967 --> 53:58.168

you dropped the disco ball.

Nina, you wear your pride
on your sleeve,

your rainbow connection.

55:48.879 --> 55:52.683
Yvie, being odd
is in your jeans,

[RuPaul] Nina, Silky,
I'm sorry, my dears,

56:17.474 --> 56:20.210
but you are both up
for elimination.

56:20.210 --> 56:21.879
I'm fighting.

56:21.879 --> 56:24.014
I want to be here.
I want to make the five.

56:24.014 --> 56:25.782
I will not give up on this.

56:25.782 --> 56:28.018
-Has Nina lip synced yet?
-No.

56:28.018 --> 56:29.019
Neither one of them have.

56:29.019 --> 56:30.153
Silky hasn't lip synced, either.

56:30.153 --> 56:31.722

to impress me

56:39.196 --> 56:41.965

from elimination.

so I ain't worried for me.
