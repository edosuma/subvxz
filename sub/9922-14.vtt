00:52.720 --> 00:53.763
Lagertha!

00:56.558 --> 00:57.809
Earl Ingstad!

01:37.765 --> 01:40.977
How strange, Lagertha,
that you should
play the usurper.

01:41.060 --> 01:42.437
One woman against another.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.731
It doesn't quite fit
with your reputation.

01:44.814 --> 01:48.067
I was never the usurper.
Always the usurped.

01:50.486 --> 01:54.532
You took my husband,
my world, and my happiness.

01:54.616 --> 01:57.869
The fact that you're a woman
is neither here nor there.

01:58.203 --> 02:01.080
I didn't take your husband.
He chose to be with me.

02:01.164 --> 02:06.044
He didn't choose.
You're a witch.
You bewitched him.

02:07.921 --> 02:10.798
If that's what
you want to believe,
it's up to you.

02:10.882 --> 02:13.259
I don't disagree women
can have power over men.

02:13.343 --> 02:16.262
But it's not always magical,
is it, Lagertha?

02:16.346 --> 02:19.933
In any case,
Ragnar is dead.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.231
You don't know that.

02:26.856 --> 02:31.361
I dreamed it.
I warned him
about his journey.

02:31.444 --> 02:35.782
In my dream,
his boats were sunk
in a storm. Ragnar died.

02:36.783 --> 02:38.534
So did my son, Ivar.

02:39.035 --> 02:41.913
But you don't know that.

02:46.542 --> 02:50.713
No.
I don't know that for sure.
It was just a dream.

02:53.174 --> 02:56.844
And I have dreamed
of taking back my home.

02:56.928 --> 02:59.597
I have dreamed it
for a long time.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.060
But if I have to
fight for it, then I will.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.440
Don't worry.
I could never
fight you, Lagertha.

03:09.524 --> 03:12.443
I am not my mother,
nor yet my father.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.112
I would never win.

03:19.158 --> 03:22.078
But still I have
fulfilled my destiny.

03:22.161 --> 03:26.624
The gods foretold Ragnar
would have many sons,

03:26.708 --> 03:28.501
and I have given
him those sons.

03:30.586 --> 03:34.173
I am as much a part
of his saga, Lagertha,
as you are.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.140
But now I renounce everything.

03:45.310 --> 03:49.105
All I ask is safe passage.

03:51.774 --> 03:56.362
All I ask is that you let me
leave here in peace,

03:56.446 --> 03:58.573
to go wherever
the gods decide.

04:00.366 --> 04:03.119
And you shall have back
your hearth and home,

04:04.662 --> 04:06.372
with my blessing.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.000
And my sons,

04:09.959 --> 04:11.461
when they hear
how it was done,

04:11.544 --> 04:14.047
will be grateful
for the manner of it,

04:15.965 --> 04:18.009
and not seek revenge.

04:21.763 --> 04:23.139
I understand.

04:34.484 --> 04:35.735
Thank you.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.523
Why did you do that?

05:13.648 --> 05:15.400
Lagertha told me to.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.236
Why?
I don't know.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.779
And where is Lagertha, huh?

05:23.408 --> 05:25.618
I said, where is Lagertha?

05:26.994 --> 05:33.126
You had best go home, Ubbe.
And you, Sigurd.
Go back to Kattegat.

05:34.377 --> 05:35.837
What has happened at Kattegat?

05:53.396 --> 05:54.605
Who are you?

05:55.523 --> 05:59.944
My son and I have come to see
a good friend, King Ecbert.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.446
We are old friends.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.535
We have traveled a long way,

06:07.618 --> 06:12.248
and my poor son is hungry
and he is thirsty.

06:12.331 --> 06:16.043
I have no doubt that
your king would like to
know of our arrival.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.130
The King is not here.

06:20.298 --> 06:22.758
I am still sure
that he'd like to know

06:22.842 --> 06:26.804
that his good friend
has been treated kindly.

06:33.311 --> 06:34.353
Let them in!

06:54.832 --> 06:56.417
Prince Aethelwulf,
we may have captured...

06:56.501 --> 06:58.085
For the love of God!
Do you not know who this is?

06:59.795 --> 07:03.758
It's Ragnar Lothbrok.
The King of the Northmen.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.553
Seize him!

07:30.368 --> 07:31.535
Who's that?

07:32.495 --> 07:33.871
A cripple.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.090
I don't like you.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.927
Where are
your warriors, hmm?

08:30.011 --> 08:31.012
There are no warriors.

08:31.095 --> 08:32.888
But you came with
a raiding party.

08:32.972 --> 08:35.016
We found bodies
on the beach.

08:35.099 --> 08:37.643
There must be more of you.
Where are they?

08:38.936 --> 08:43.441
There is no one else.
Just my son, Ivar, and me.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.361
Ah, the cripple
is your son.

08:47.862 --> 08:48.946
Yes.

08:53.993 --> 08:57.455
Well, I don't believe
there is only you.

08:59.290 --> 09:01.917
I killed everyone else.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.545
You must have found
their bodies, too.

09:08.466 --> 09:09.675
Where is my son?

09:09.759 --> 09:11.135
Don't worry about him.

09:11.469 --> 09:13.304
Don't you worry
about your sons?

09:13.637 --> 09:17.516
What do you know
about my sons?

09:18.309 --> 09:21.645
You're an animal and
you belong in a cage.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.356
And if it were up to me...

09:23.439 --> 09:24.982
Where is your father?

12:02.097 --> 12:03.766
- Your Highness.
- My Lord.

12:06.227 --> 12:07.394
The King!

12:10.523 --> 12:11.732
My Lord.

12:18.531 --> 12:19.573
Father, I have news.

12:19.657 --> 12:21.825
Where is he?
What have you done with him?

12:51.522 --> 12:52.606
Leave.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.361
Leave.

13:13.669 --> 13:15.212
What took you so long?

13:27.558 --> 13:30.561
What is it?
Why don't you eat?

13:31.395 --> 13:35.065
I have not seen my son,
Ivar, for days.

13:37.401 --> 13:38.861
I don't even
know if he's alive.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.908
I will not eat
until my son does.

14:28.369 --> 14:32.331
Your son is also my guest.

14:39.797 --> 14:44.134
Believe me, I will make sure
that no harm comes to him.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.348
Make sure he's well kept.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.476
Sire.

15:03.821 --> 15:05.155
What did he say?

15:08.242 --> 15:09.576
He said, "Thank you."

15:10.202 --> 15:11.412
Hmm.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.086
It was wrong of
my son to slaughter

15:19.211 --> 15:22.256
all your farmers
and their families.

15:22.339 --> 15:26.343
But, as you probably guessed,
it was done under my orders.

15:31.432 --> 15:34.184
It's always better to
get the worst things
over straightaway.

15:34.685 --> 15:35.686
Don't you agree?

15:37.521 --> 15:41.900
<i>Mea culpa. Mea maxima culpa.</i>

15:41.984 --> 15:43.986
It was my decision.

15:44.653 --> 15:51.535
Of course, it was part
of a larger and
bolder strategy, but...

15:53.871 --> 15:55.748
Well, none of that's
of your concern.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.552
On your previous visit,

16:09.762 --> 16:12.556
you left behind another son.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.227
Fetch Magnus.

16:22.566 --> 16:27.029
Unfortunately, his mother,
Queen Kwenthrith,
is no longer with us.

16:27.404 --> 16:30.657
But I've looked after the boy
as if he were my own.

16:33.577 --> 16:36.497
Come forward, boy.
Come, come.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.337
This is your son, Magnus.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.551
Go on, Magnus.
Speak to your father.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.892
I have waited a very long
time for this moment.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.937
My mother told me
so much about you.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.689
She told me I was like you,

17:04.316 --> 17:07.152
and that one day
I'd be famous like you.

17:08.654 --> 17:12.616
And now I see you,
everything she
told me was true.

17:14.493 --> 17:16.286
Everything about my
life makes sense now.

17:18.997 --> 17:24.127
Someone once explained
to me what a miracle is,

17:25.420 --> 17:29.591
so now I understand,
Magnus...

17:29.675 --> 17:32.302
Your birth was a miracle.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.057
A miracle?

17:37.683 --> 17:38.976
Yes.

17:43.188 --> 17:47.442
Because I never had
sex with your mother.

17:48.986 --> 17:51.363
All she ever did
was piss on me.

17:57.828 --> 18:02.875
Perhaps you should
leave us, Magnus.
Talk to him later, all right?

18:16.722 --> 18:19.975
You know, I had my doubts
about that boy all along.

18:28.317 --> 18:30.777
Why have you taken
so long to return?

18:34.406 --> 18:39.995
It's part of a larger
and bolder strategy.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.928
We should drink.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.615
Where's our mother?

19:59.783 --> 20:03.286
She's dead, Ubbe.
I killed her.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.540
Why?

20:06.832 --> 20:10.752
She took
Kattegat away from me.
I wanted it back.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.637
Why didn't you
also have us killed?

20:20.887 --> 20:23.306
This was nothing
to do with you.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.101
You are Ragnar's sons.

20:26.184 --> 20:30.313
It was not your fault
that your father
was bewitched.

20:31.982 --> 20:33.734
It was a mistake
not to kill us.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.488
That's a chance I was
prepared to take.

20:47.664 --> 20:48.707
Ubbe...

21:26.369 --> 21:28.789
I don't like
to see you in a cage.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.836
What would you do
if I let you out?

21:37.798 --> 21:39.007
I would kill you.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.510
Oh.

21:46.139 --> 21:50.018
Or not. It is your decision,
not mine.

21:50.477 --> 21:53.230
Hmm? You have
the power, not me.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.487
And you like power, don't you?

22:03.073 --> 22:09.955
Well, I only like it
because it allows me
to do good things.

22:18.213 --> 22:19.256
Really?

22:30.183 --> 22:32.727
I think I've used
my power rather well.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.691
For example,
I've used it to unite

22:37.774 --> 22:40.944
all the small,
squabbling kingdoms

22:41.111 --> 22:44.281
of England into
a single entity,

22:44.364 --> 22:47.200
now capable of
defending itself against any

22:47.284 --> 22:49.494
who might come to
threaten or destroy it.

22:51.454 --> 22:52.581
Like me.

22:53.331 --> 22:56.543
I thought you came
in search of
good farming lands

22:56.626 --> 22:58.295
and that you wanted
to find some way

22:58.378 --> 23:01.756
that our peoples
could live together
and mutually benefit.

23:01.923 --> 23:05.719
Oh, so you thought
by killing all of my people,

23:05.802 --> 23:09.097
that was mutually
beneficial, hmm?

23:09.180 --> 23:11.892
No, no. Of course not.

23:11.975 --> 23:15.103
I've already expressed
my deep regret.

23:20.734 --> 23:27.574
The fact is,
it was the right idea
at the wrong time.

23:29.492 --> 23:32.704
But I firmly and I
absolutely believe

23:32.787 --> 23:35.415
that such accommodations
will come to pass.

23:37.042 --> 23:41.004
Perhaps,
even in my grandson's time.
In Alfred's time.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.809
What do you want me to say?

23:58.730 --> 24:00.023
The truth.

24:04.903 --> 24:07.072
Let's go and do it now.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.491
Let's go to the Great Hall
and let's finish her off.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.369
If you want to
do it, then do it.
But count me out.

24:13.536 --> 24:14.955
What are you talking about?

24:16.289 --> 24:17.832
She wouldn't
have done it for us.

24:18.375 --> 24:19.376
What?

24:19.459 --> 24:21.711
Try to understand.
She didn't want us.

24:22.545 --> 24:25.298
She never loved us.
She only loved Ivar.

24:26.967 --> 24:31.721
Oh, yeah, and Harbard.
Yes, she loved
Harbard all right.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.517
She made a fool of
herself loving him.
You should have seen her.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.935
You forget. I did see.

24:39.396 --> 24:40.939
Do you think
Harbard was a god?

24:42.732 --> 24:44.025
Was he a god, Ubbe?
Or just a man?

24:44.109 --> 24:45.360
He took advantage.

24:46.236 --> 24:48.321
I guess that
doesn't matter either way.

24:48.613 --> 24:50.073
She was still our mother!

24:55.704 --> 24:57.914
By the end,
she was a stranger to me.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.334
Was she a witch?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.588
We'll never know.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.632
Ah, no.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.761
Lagertha must pay the price.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.597
Let Ivar kill
her if he wants to.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.349
If he's still alive.

25:17.934 --> 25:18.935
What?

25:19.769 --> 25:22.022
Both our parents may be dead.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.399
We may have just
become orphans, Sigurd.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.194
What are you laughing at?

25:28.903 --> 25:30.488
Our father isn't dead, Ubbe!

25:32.574 --> 25:34.367
Ragnar Lothbrok can't die.

25:41.958 --> 25:46.629
For my people,
for the people
outside of this villa,

25:46.713 --> 25:50.383
and for most of them
inside of it, too,
for that matter,

25:52.802 --> 25:57.057
you are the most dangerous
man on this earth.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.651
You have quite the reputation.

26:10.361 --> 26:14.407
They're all
mortally terrified of you.

26:17.410 --> 26:18.578
What about you?

26:35.887 --> 26:37.096
Are you sure?

26:44.813 --> 26:47.482
Not entirely, no.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.333
You have to kill me.

27:50.253 --> 27:53.840
Well, I have to
decide your fate. Yes.

27:56.426 --> 27:58.386
You sound like
one of our gods.

27:59.762 --> 28:02.432
Well, I'm not a god.
God forbid.

28:09.814 --> 28:16.654
The Seer told me
that I am fated to die
the day the blind man sees me.

28:19.282 --> 28:24.245
But you...
You have to kill me.

28:26.789 --> 28:28.291
Must we talk of death?

28:30.126 --> 28:35.340
Death has been
uppermost on my mind
for a long time.

28:35.924 --> 28:38.635
You Vikings are incorrigible.

28:38.718 --> 28:42.722
You emerge from the womb
with only one
thing on your mind.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.182
How to die!

28:46.142 --> 28:48.311
What of all
the things in between?

28:54.233 --> 28:55.652
Are you talking about women?

29:20.718 --> 29:24.097
We have a lot to
talk about, you and I.

29:31.688 --> 29:33.856
Keep the braziers going!

29:35.900 --> 29:37.151
Where are we going?

29:37.235 --> 29:42.699
Magnus,
it's time for you to leave
and become a man.

29:42.782 --> 29:43.866
But I don't want to leave.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.118
You have no choice.

29:47.912 --> 29:50.039
Here's some food
for your journey.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.166
Double up the watch there!

29:52.250 --> 29:53.418
Where shall I go?

29:53.501 --> 29:55.294
Destiny will take you.

29:55.378 --> 29:58.715
And wherever you go,
you tell people
that you are Magnus,

29:58.840 --> 30:03.428
the son of Ragnar Lothbrok.
And people will
look after you.

30:03.511 --> 30:07.181
You can't make me go, please!
I'm happy here. I won't go!

30:10.560 --> 30:12.145
Start walking.

30:12.562 --> 30:15.898
You start walking
or you're going to die.
Do you understand?

30:16.482 --> 30:18.359
But there's
animals in the woods.

30:18.609 --> 30:21.863
There are animals
in the villa. Now go.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.614
Back in the shelter!

30:23.698 --> 30:24.741
Go!

30:25.241 --> 30:26.743
Horses under cover!

30:27.827 --> 30:28.911
Aye, sir.

30:53.102 --> 30:55.480
What if
your god does not exist?

30:55.563 --> 30:58.733
My dear friend,
what are you
talking about?

31:00.151 --> 31:04.655
Your god, my gods,
what if they don't exist?

31:04.739 --> 31:09.368
Well, if God,
or the gods don't exist,
then nothing has meaning.

31:09.452 --> 31:11.162
Or everything has meaning.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.122
What on earth
does that mean?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.126
Why do you need your god?

31:19.545 --> 31:21.255
Well, if there were no gods,

31:21.339 --> 31:24.884
then anyone could do anything,
and nothing would matter.

31:24.967 --> 31:28.513
You could do as you liked
and nothing would be real!

31:28.596 --> 31:31.432
And nothing would
have meaning or value!

31:31.516 --> 31:34.602
So, even if the gods
don't exist,

31:34.685 --> 31:37.730
it's still
necessary to have them.

31:38.064 --> 31:41.859
If they don't exist,
then they don't exist.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.486
We have to live with it.

31:43.820 --> 31:47.115
Ah. Yes, but you don't.
You don't live with it!

31:47.198 --> 31:51.202
You only think of death.
You only think of Valhalla.

31:51.285 --> 31:55.123
And all you think
about is Heaven!

31:56.415 --> 31:58.876
Which seems like
a ridiculous place,

31:59.001 --> 32:01.462
where everybody
is always happy.

32:01.546 --> 32:03.840
Valhalla is ridiculous!

32:03.923 --> 32:08.845
All the dead warriors
get to fight again in
the courtyard each morning,

32:08.928 --> 32:14.433
and kill each other again,
and then, they all
have supper together.

32:14.809 --> 32:18.938
Then they
are both ridiculous.

32:31.325 --> 32:35.371
Athelstan was a man of God.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.085
And now he is dead.

32:49.510 --> 32:50.970
Tell me what happened.

32:55.266 --> 32:56.642
Floki killed him.

32:59.562 --> 33:00.897
So your gods killed him.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.608
No, Floki killed
him out of jealousy.

33:03.691 --> 33:06.235
Because I loved
Athelstan more than him.

33:12.366 --> 33:16.954
I was jealous, too.
When he chose to
go back with you...

33:18.915 --> 33:22.251
I felt his loss grievously,

33:22.710 --> 33:29.425
as if he'd torn part of myself
away from myself.

33:35.014 --> 33:37.266
He left because
he loved me more.

33:38.726 --> 33:42.563
Well, then, you
should have protected him.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.190
He didn't need protecting.

33:44.273 --> 33:45.650
What does that mean?

33:45.733 --> 33:48.653
We needed him.
He never needed us.

33:48.736 --> 33:51.530
If he'd stayed here with me,
he'd still be alive.

33:51.781 --> 33:53.366
He had enemies here, also.

33:53.449 --> 33:56.661
He belonged here with me.
I would have protected him.

33:56.744 --> 33:59.080
Who are you to say
where he belonged?

34:00.873 --> 34:03.167
He chose to be with me.

34:03.251 --> 34:07.630
He chose his path
and that was with me.
I am not to blame.

34:13.970 --> 34:16.722
Now who's the one
who's not being honest?

34:28.442 --> 34:29.527
Tell me this.

34:32.655 --> 34:37.118
Do you think he
is with your gods
or with mine?

34:40.997 --> 34:42.498
It does not matter.

34:45.293 --> 34:49.130
His death is on
my conscience, not yours.

34:53.968 --> 34:56.220
And yours will be on mine.

34:59.015 --> 35:00.224
Even so,

35:03.102 --> 35:04.603
you have to kill me.

35:31.672 --> 35:32.798
What?

35:37.094 --> 35:40.431
Oh, do not get up.
I am Astrid.

35:42.266 --> 35:46.020
We know who you are.
But why are you here?

35:48.814 --> 35:52.068
One day, I will like to
change the way you look.

35:54.904 --> 35:56.697
It is just
an interest of mine.

35:59.158 --> 36:00.242
What?

36:00.326 --> 36:04.663
I am making it my business
to make friends with
the sons of Ragnar.

36:08.459 --> 36:11.420
Forgive me, Astrid,

36:13.130 --> 36:14.298
but I am afraid that we...

36:14.382 --> 36:15.633
Yes,

36:16.592 --> 36:17.718
you should be afraid.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.847
That's what I
came to tell you.

36:23.766 --> 36:27.812
If you touch a hair
on Lagertha's head,
you are dead men.

36:40.908 --> 36:45.079
Do you really think
that if I am not
afraid of Lagertha,

36:45.329 --> 36:46.872
then I would be afraid of you?

37:28.706 --> 37:32.084
It's a great
privilege to meet you again,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

37:36.130 --> 37:38.632
Not every Saxon
would agree.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.344
I'm not every Saxon.

37:51.979 --> 37:54.815
This is my son, Alfred.

37:55.191 --> 37:57.067
He is the son...
I know.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.529
Without explanation.

38:14.168 --> 38:15.920
You are Athelstan's son.

38:55.626 --> 39:01.090
I have seen all the works
that are done under the sun.

39:01.882 --> 39:07.346
And behold,
all is vanity and
vexation of spirit.

39:08.472 --> 39:11.433
I communed with
mine own heart, saying,

39:11.559 --> 39:14.436
"Lo,
I am come to great estate."

39:17.773 --> 39:20.484
And I gave my heart
to know wisdom,

39:20.568 --> 39:23.195
and to know
madness and folly.

39:25.447 --> 39:30.619
I perceived that this, also,
is vexation of spirit.

39:32.454 --> 39:35.040
For in such wisdom
is much grief,

39:36.292 --> 39:41.839
and he that
increases knowledge
increases sorrow.

40:49.615 --> 40:50.741
I cannot kill you,

40:52.409 --> 40:53.994
yet you must die.

40:55.162 --> 40:59.416
This much is certain.
The world demands it.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.045
But I cannot kill you.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.468
Then hand me over
to King Aelle.

41:11.178 --> 41:15.307
For we both know that
he would take great pleasure
in killing me.

41:15.391 --> 41:17.267
Then you can wash
your hands of me.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.396
My friend,
I'd rather set you free.

41:25.359 --> 41:29.279
My sons know
that I have come to
Wessex to see you.

41:30.322 --> 41:34.326
What do you think they'll do,
once they hear of my death?

41:36.412 --> 41:37.871
They will come over here

41:37.955 --> 41:40.916
and they will rip the lungs
out of all of you.

41:42.334 --> 41:43.752
There will be no escape.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.756
They will avenge me.

41:49.508 --> 41:50.926
I don't doubt you.

41:53.470 --> 41:55.472
We trust each other, yes?

41:58.517 --> 41:59.560
Yes.

42:04.398 --> 42:05.899
Then do this for me.

42:07.776 --> 42:10.446
Let my crippled son,
Ivar, go home.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.700
He is obviously
no threat to you.

42:16.785 --> 42:18.871
You arrange for a ship,
for sailors.

42:18.954 --> 42:21.498
You just make sure
my son gets home safely.

42:24.418 --> 42:25.752
You have my word.

42:32.176 --> 42:33.594
And in return?

42:36.346 --> 42:40.392
I will tell my son, Ivar,
to tell his brothers

42:40.476 --> 42:44.396
that you did everything
you could to save me.

42:44.480 --> 42:48.025
That you and I,
we are sworn friends,

42:48.108 --> 42:49.401
and that King Aelle

42:49.485 --> 42:52.279
was solely responsible
for my death.

42:53.530 --> 42:57.618
That way,
when my sons come back,
and they will,

42:59.828 --> 43:03.707
they will spare you,
my friend,

43:05.501 --> 43:09.171
and they will take out
all of their
revenge on King Aelle.

43:14.218 --> 43:15.427
Then do it.

43:17.596 --> 43:19.139
Deliver me to Aelle.

43:52.839 --> 43:54.216
And don't be afraid.
