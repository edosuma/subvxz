WEBVTT

00:02.611 --> 00:04.178
Why didn't you just
stick to the damn plan?

00:04.221 --> 00:07.007
Castiel: The plan changed, Dean.
Something went wrong.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.834
Yeah, why does that something
always seem to be you?

00:08.878 --> 00:10.662
I don't think
there's anything left to say.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.012
Where are you going?

00:12.055 --> 00:13.274
I think it's time
for me to move on.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.058
Rowena: Magic can do anything.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.756
I'll absorb the ghosts and
demons and return them to Hell.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.932
To perform this spell,
I have to die,

00:19.976 --> 00:22.196
but it has to be you
that kills me.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.675
There has to be
another way.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.245

You know
they still put, um,

03:23.028 --> 03:24.552
jokes on the backs
of these things.

03:24.595 --> 03:28.904
Listen to this one --
What's round and bad-tempered?

03:28.947 --> 03:30.906
"A vicious circle."

03:30.949 --> 03:32.777
'Cause it's --

03:32.821 --> 03:34.953
Yeah, I -- I --

03:34.997 --> 03:37.391
Wait a second, did you eat
the whole box?

03:37.434 --> 03:40.524
Yeah. Yeah.
Because I'm a champion.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.222
Wait a second.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.876
So I've been looking for signs
of -- of God or -- or Lilith,

03:44.920 --> 03:46.661
and you've been in your room,
eating cereal.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.271
And marathoning
"Scooby-Doo."

03:50.142 --> 03:52.449
Well,
did you find anything?

03:52.493 --> 03:54.277
No, not yet.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.236
Shocker.

03:58.847 --> 04:02.242
Hey, did you notice anything
weird just now when you came in?

04:04.026 --> 04:06.202
No. Why, did you have another
one of your visions?

04:06.246 --> 04:08.944
No. I haven't had a vision
since Colorado.

04:08.987 --> 04:11.033
I think
maybe they stopped.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.861
Oh, I doubt it.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.866
Not until Chuck gets
his end game, you know?

04:17.909 --> 04:19.563
The Winchester Bowl.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.435
Can and Abel 2.0.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.350
This is God
we're talking about.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.613
G-O-D.

04:25.656 --> 04:28.746
Wouldn't be too worried
about finding him.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.444
He'll find us.

04:44.022 --> 04:46.634
Andy: Hey, Clarence.

04:46.677 --> 04:47.896
Morning.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.202
Come on in, early bird.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.165
Well...

04:56.208 --> 04:57.471
What can I do for ya?

04:57.514 --> 04:59.473
Bait working out good?

04:59.516 --> 05:01.736
Oh, yeah.
The...

05:01.779 --> 05:03.520
Bait's good.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.521
I think it's the fish.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.567
They've begun
to anticipate me.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.220
Yeah,
fish can be smart.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.483
I'd switch up spots.

05:09.526 --> 05:12.355
Maps are over there.

05:16.968 --> 05:20.972
I had a friend who always
praised fishing

05:21.016 --> 05:23.323
for its meditative
qualities.

05:23.366 --> 05:26.064
Wish I found it
more relaxing.

05:31.766 --> 05:35.596
Andy...

05:35.639 --> 05:37.424
is everything all right?

05:37.467 --> 05:39.513
Oh, uh...

05:41.645 --> 05:44.169
I'm, uh, volunteer
fire department.

05:44.213 --> 05:47.303
We pulled a body out of the lake
this morning.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.740
Missing kid.
Shane Coogan.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.525
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

05:51.568 --> 05:55.050
You know, not my first
dead body, but...

05:55.093 --> 05:58.140
Ah, the way he looked,
I guessed he drowned.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.751
Except he was juiced.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.187
Juiced?

06:02.231 --> 06:06.148
Mm. Like drained,
like, of his blood.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.586
Weird, huh?

06:10.457 --> 06:12.415
Is that everything
for you?

06:12.459 --> 06:14.591
Yeah.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.627
Eileen?

06:53.630 --> 06:55.719
Hi, Sam.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.417
Dean:
So, you were in Hell?

06:57.460 --> 06:59.506
You didn't make a deal.
You were innocent.

06:59.549 --> 07:00.942
You've been down there
this whole time?

07:00.985 --> 07:06.643
The Hellhound that killed me
kind of dragged me there.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.689
Damn.

07:08.732 --> 07:11.387
Yeah, um,
she escaped when, uh,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.911
Chuck blew all the doors open,
and then...

07:13.955 --> 07:15.652
I hauled ass.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.393
Far as I could.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.742
So by the time
we got the barrier up,

07:18.786 --> 07:20.309
you were already gone.

07:20.352 --> 07:25.357
Been trying to get you guys
to see me for a while now.

07:25.401 --> 07:30.319
This whole ghost thing doesn't
really come with a handbook.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.105
Look, I don't know
how all this works,

07:34.149 --> 07:36.630
but I know how it ends.

07:36.673 --> 07:40.503
We go crazy.

07:42.244 --> 07:45.682
We hurt people.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.510
I can't stay here,

07:47.554 --> 07:50.731
and I won't
go back down there.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.560
So I thought...

07:53.603 --> 07:55.692
You guys know angels.

07:55.736 --> 08:00.741
Maybe if you put in a good word,
you know, up there...

08:00.784 --> 08:03.700
Eileen, even if we did,
it wouldn't matter.

08:03.744 --> 08:07.574
Souls from Hell
can't go to Heaven.

08:07.617 --> 08:11.055
A friend of ours
just found that out.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.581
I'm sorry.

08:14.624 --> 08:17.714
Yeah.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.589
Me too.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.941
Nice, man.
Real sensitive.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.595
You want me to
sugarcoat it?

08:28.638 --> 08:30.597
No, I don't want --
of course not.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.034
But, Dean --

08:33.077 --> 08:34.470
There may be
an Option B.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.776
Do we have any of those
soul catchers,

08:35.819 --> 08:37.560
you know, like the ones
we used in Harlan?

08:37.604 --> 08:42.434
You want to trap Eileen in
a prison full of psycho ghosts?

08:42.478 --> 08:43.740
No, no, no.
Not with them.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.786
We'd -- We'd make her her own,
you know?

08:45.829 --> 08:47.135
Look, it's better
than where she was,

08:47.178 --> 08:48.876
and it's better than
where she's going.

08:48.919 --> 08:51.618
Dean, that spell --
it's not exactly easy.

08:51.661 --> 08:55.404
Okay, but, you know, you're
like, uh, Rowena's protégé.

08:55.447 --> 08:56.753
You're a regular
Ginger Jr.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.712
Even if I could,
I would need a crystal.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.235
I mean, those were
Rowena's thing.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.324
Okay. Look, man, this blows.
I get it.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.717
I don't make the rules.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.936
A soul from Hell
can't go to Heaven.

09:05.980 --> 09:09.505
All right, look, if it's what
Eileen wants, then...

09:09.549 --> 09:11.507
Maybe we can go
to Rowena's place

09:11.551 --> 09:13.814
and look for a crystal,
or something.

09:13.857 --> 09:18.035
I've been meaning to go there
anyways after, uh...

09:18.079 --> 09:19.559
You know.

09:19.602 --> 09:22.039
Great.
Do that.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.215
Wait, wait.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.216
You're not
coming with?

09:25.260 --> 09:28.176
It's a milk run.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.699
You're --

09:29.743 --> 09:31.527
You know what, Dean,
ever since God got back,

09:31.571 --> 09:33.311
you've been acting like
there's nothing we can do,

09:33.355 --> 09:35.836
like nothing matters,
but we can do this.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.402
Man, this matters.

09:37.446 --> 09:40.710
And that's why you're gonna
kick it in the ass.

09:45.323 --> 09:48.326
When will
the Sheriff be back?

09:48.370 --> 09:51.286
Five minutes?
An hour?

09:51.329 --> 09:52.809
It's Tuesday, Agent.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.855
He gets his hair cut
on Tuesday.

09:54.898 --> 09:57.727
He gets his hair--

09:57.771 --> 10:00.512
I see.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.910
You're FBI?

10:06.954 --> 10:10.261
I thought you were renting
the Doweling cabin.

10:10.305 --> 10:14.657
Uh, small town...

10:14.701 --> 10:16.267
Uh...

10:16.311 --> 10:18.400
I'm, uh --

10:19.880 --> 10:21.055
I'm on vacation.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.752
But you're looking into
that missing boy,

10:22.796 --> 10:24.362
the one that they found
in the lake?

10:24.406 --> 10:25.755
Do you know him?

10:25.799 --> 10:29.541
Uh, no, but I --

10:29.585 --> 10:31.761
I think my son's missing,
too.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.850
Um...

10:33.894 --> 10:35.765
I -- I let him camp out
last night,

10:35.809 --> 10:37.898
and he was supposed to be back
first thing this morning.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.422
Honey,
it's only a few hours.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.903
He'll turn up.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.600
She thinks
I'm overreacting

10:44.644 --> 10:46.384
because this town,
it's like a postcard,

10:46.428 --> 10:48.996
but now, with that other boy,
I just --

10:49.039 --> 10:50.475
I...

10:50.519 --> 10:52.608
I need to find my son.

10:52.652 --> 10:57.308
Right.Please, um, Agent, um...

10:57.352 --> 11:00.181
Um...Worley.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.836
Can you help me?

11:03.880 --> 11:05.229
Of course.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.936
I --

11:15.979 --> 11:18.721
I'm sorry.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.723
I wish there was
more we could do.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.420
I hate this for you.

11:22.464 --> 11:26.120
Whatever that crystal is,
I'll take it.

11:26.163 --> 11:29.384
At least I won't be...

11:29.427 --> 11:31.778
you know.

11:31.821 --> 11:35.390
Yeah.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.827
I've been there, too --
uh, Hell.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.611
A long time ago.

11:39.655 --> 11:43.703
You try and forget,
but it gets inside you.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.795
Talking helps.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.841
I can't.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.887
Not yet.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.892
I understand.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.460
Not bad.

12:04.593 --> 12:05.899
I'm impressed.

12:07.117 --> 12:10.947
After we met,
I started practicing again.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.776
I guess
some of it stuck.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.867
Who's she?

13:00.910 --> 13:02.390
I don't know.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.668
Well, look at you.

13:26.370 --> 13:29.504
Wait a second.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.901
She was goth?

13:34.944 --> 13:36.903
No, close.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.948
I recognize that.

13:38.992 --> 13:41.124
It's from
the "Ordo maleficarum."

13:41.168 --> 13:44.736
A witch.
Yeah.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.870
Looks like
she tore this place apart.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.394
I mean, maybe she got into
something she shouldn't have.

13:50.438 --> 13:51.874
Great.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.310
Okay, let's just find
what we're looking for

13:53.354 --> 13:55.051
and get out of here.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.059
Sheriff Roy:
Melly Krokowski.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.322
From the day that woman graced
us with her presence,

14:05.366 --> 14:07.063
it's always something --

14:07.107 --> 14:08.848
too much fluoride
in the water,

14:08.891 --> 14:11.720
not enough vegan options
at the 4th of July parade,

14:11.763 --> 14:14.810
that we even have
the 4th of July parade.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.247
Sheriff,
her son is missing.

14:17.291 --> 14:21.686
And maybe if this were New York,
I'd be worried.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.950
Here?
A teenager stays out too long,

14:23.993 --> 14:26.343
he's probably with his buddies
sobering up.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.693
So people rarely
go missing here?

14:28.737 --> 14:33.046
I mean, not locals.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.004
But it is
a tourist town.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.485
Some years,
we lose a hiker.

14:37.528 --> 14:38.921
Somebody drowns.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.706
Like Shane Coogan?
No.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.931
Shane came out for last year's
Bluegrass festival.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.802
Parents
raised a big stink,

14:50.846 --> 14:53.936
but locals saw him
holed up in the woods.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.895
Opioids.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.766
Wound up in the lake.
O.D.'d.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.682
I'd like to take a look
at the body.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.600
Already on its way
to Cheyenne.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.036
We don't have an M.E.

15:07.080 --> 15:11.084
Well, any case work you do have
will be fine.

15:11.127 --> 15:14.522
Which office you say you were
from again, Agent Worley?

15:14.565 --> 15:16.263
Special Agent.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.047
D.C.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.180
You got a supervisor
I could talk to,

15:20.223 --> 15:21.181
make it official?

15:39.764 --> 15:41.766
Dean: This is
Assistant Director Kaiser.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.203
Uh...

15:43.246 --> 15:44.856
This is Sheriff Alden Roy.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.771
Just checking on
Agent Worley.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.512
Would you put my agent
on the phone, please?

15:48.556 --> 15:51.559
He wants to
talk to you.

15:58.174 --> 15:59.219
Hello?

15:59.262 --> 16:00.394
Cass.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.439
Sam's been trying
to call you.

16:02.483 --> 16:03.745
I know.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.051
Did you check his messages?Nope.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.791
Right. Smart.
Why would you?

16:06.835 --> 16:09.185
Look, I don't know if you care
or not, but, uh...

16:09.229 --> 16:13.624
God -- Chuck -- is back on
the board, so watch yourself.

16:13.668 --> 16:17.324
And check
your damn messages.

16:24.461 --> 16:27.116
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.207
I'll get you those files.

16:31.251 --> 16:32.469
Thank you.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.090
This is just junk.

16:44.133 --> 16:48.224
Tarot cards,

16:48.268 --> 16:50.226
self-help books.

16:51.619 --> 16:54.143
Where's her real stash?

17:08.331 --> 17:09.550
Eileen?

17:12.118 --> 17:13.554
Sam?

17:13.597 --> 17:15.164
In here.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.299
Ta-da!

17:42.235 --> 17:43.453
Sam?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.979
Uh...

17:48.023 --> 17:50.286
She kept journals.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.027
Rowena?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.985
Yeah.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.118
Her spell work.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.685
All of it.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.775
Right up until
the end.

18:09.523 --> 18:13.266
You miss her.

18:15.572 --> 18:16.704
I killed her.

18:19.837 --> 18:22.013
Her idea.

18:22.057 --> 18:26.496
She, uh, sacrificed herself
to save us.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.847
To --
To save the world.

18:33.460 --> 18:37.246
You ever feel like you're the
punch line to some cosmic joke?

18:37.290 --> 18:40.336
Are you kidding?

18:50.912 --> 18:52.261
Rowena got it.

18:52.305 --> 18:55.003
I mean, she didn't know
all the details,

18:55.046 --> 18:56.570
but she knew
the game was rigged.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.485
So this --

18:58.528 --> 19:00.313
Magic.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.315
This is how
she kept control.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.287
No way.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.342
Sam.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.126
What's going on?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.302
Okay.
When my mom was killed, uh,

19:33.346 --> 19:35.217
Rowena tried to bring her back,
but she couldn't.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.654
She needed a body,
which we didn't have.

19:37.698 --> 19:40.614
Turns out, Rowena was working on
a way to bring her back,

19:40.657 --> 19:43.921
a way around that, a-a way to
make the spirit flesh.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.575
She didn't use it?

19:45.619 --> 19:48.535
We ended up finding out my mom
was in Heaven already and happy,

19:48.578 --> 19:49.971
so...

19:50.014 --> 19:52.234
She never finished it.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.715
But...

19:54.758 --> 19:57.196
I think
I can finish it.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.154
So?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.722
So...

20:01.765 --> 20:04.899
Eileen,

20:04.942 --> 20:07.467
we can bring you back.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.465
All right.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.424
That's everything.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.346
Sam?

21:04.306 --> 21:05.786
Sam?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.362
What's happening?

21:35.555 --> 21:37.557
My brother.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.907
Umbra, abi.

21:45.565 --> 21:48.350
Hello, Sam.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.625
Sam: Who are you?

22:06.934 --> 22:09.458
Rowena MacLeod
is dead.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.505
We came for
what she left behind,

22:12.548 --> 22:15.551
and just when we thought
we wouldn't get it...

22:15.595 --> 22:16.857
You come along.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.428
Hmm.
Lucky us.

22:22.471 --> 22:24.212
What?

22:24.255 --> 22:25.779
The apartment's hexed.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.041
It's potent magic.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.043
Anyone who
steps insides dies.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.784
Except, apparently,
you.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.048
Mm-hmm.
Surprised?

22:34.091 --> 22:35.310
Yeah. Me too.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.443
I only know Rowena
by reputation.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.488
Respect, but...

22:39.532 --> 22:43.536
To imagine her leaving all
her Earthly treasures to you...

22:44.928 --> 22:46.626
So the body we found...

22:46.669 --> 22:47.931
That was one of yours.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.891
Mm.
Jacinda, my oldest.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.806
She's young.
She'll learn.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.982
Now you're gonna
bring her back.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.636
Well,
of course I am, yeah.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.594
This is good magic.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.728
Listen, you need me.

23:01.771 --> 23:02.859
Hmm.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.121
You want Rowena's stuff?

23:04.165 --> 23:05.949
I can get it for you.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.864
But I need that spell.

23:07.908 --> 23:10.214
Oh. Hm.

23:10.258 --> 23:12.347
I'm sorry, no.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.697
I'd never
give up my girl.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.441
Okay,
then we'll both use it.

23:19.485 --> 23:22.575
We can't. A spell like this,
you can only use once.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.621
Show Death a loophole,
and she closes it.

23:25.665 --> 23:29.495
And, well, I think
you'll help us anyway.

23:29.538 --> 23:32.062
Emily.

23:34.978 --> 23:37.503
Borrowed
some of your hair.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.722
Hmm.

23:39.766 --> 23:42.421
Now, a choice --

23:42.464 --> 23:45.511
you can do as you're told

23:45.554 --> 23:47.208
and die quick.

23:47.251 --> 23:50.211
Or you can play tough and...

23:54.520 --> 23:55.956
Oh.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.613
...and die slowly.

24:00.656 --> 24:01.744
It's up to you.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.705
Hm.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.326
Okay,
so I followed you.

24:18.369 --> 24:21.198
Melly,
you shouldn't be here.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.505
Please, Agent Worley,
you have to let me help.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.551
I told Caleb to get off
"Fortnite,"

24:25.594 --> 24:27.683
to get some fresh air.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.685
This isn't your fault.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.297
What are those X's?

24:34.429 --> 24:37.345
They're where they found --

24:37.388 --> 24:40.217
A number of people have
gone missing in this area.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.741
And you think Caleb...

24:43.046 --> 24:45.135
No, he wouldn't come out here.
He knows it's not safe.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.181
With the mine?
Mine?

24:47.224 --> 24:48.617
Yeah,
the old silver mine.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.490
The EPA shut it down
in the '70s -- toxic runoff.

24:53.883 --> 24:56.146
Can you show me
where it is?

24:56.190 --> 24:57.713
No.

24:57.757 --> 25:00.542
But I can take you.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.067
Okay.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.721
Stay close.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.697
It's Emily, right?

25:25.785 --> 25:28.701
Is this your thing,
robbing dead people?

25:28.744 --> 25:29.789
No talking.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.579
Right.

25:42.410 --> 25:45.152
Make it quick,
just the good stuff.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.646
Hey, I can look for something
to cover her up.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.871
Do you think
she's pretty?

26:08.915 --> 26:12.135
Everyone
thinks she's pretty.

26:12.179 --> 26:16.792
I mean, uh,
she's dead.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.666
For now.

26:24.713 --> 26:27.237
Were you close?

26:28.412 --> 26:31.633
She made my life hell.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.809
Really?

26:33.853 --> 26:35.855
What did she do?

26:39.554 --> 26:43.123
Listen, I get it.
All right?

26:43.166 --> 26:44.951
I mean, I --
I have an older brother.

26:44.994 --> 26:49.695
When I was 10, he -- he put
superglue in my toothpaste.

26:49.738 --> 26:52.045
Yeah?

26:52.088 --> 26:54.003
Yeah.

26:57.441 --> 27:00.401
Once,
she made me invisible --

27:00.444 --> 27:02.229
for a week.

27:02.272 --> 27:05.319
Okay, well,
that's not so --

27:05.362 --> 27:07.408
And she tried to
sell my soul to a demon

27:07.451 --> 27:10.977
and she turned my first crush
into a water balloon --

27:11.020 --> 27:13.066
and popped him.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.329
Oh.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.374
And then she got mean.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.684
Start packing.

27:37.873 --> 27:38.831
Are we close?

27:38.874 --> 27:41.311
I think so.

27:41.355 --> 27:44.358
Thanks for doing this
on your vacation.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.012
Well,
it's not really a --

27:46.055 --> 27:49.319
I needed
to step away.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.712
Burnout's a bitch,
right?

27:50.756 --> 27:53.236
Yeah.
My colleagues and I, we, uh --

27:53.280 --> 27:56.457
I guess you could say we had
a falling out with management.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.807
Well,
and each other.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.941
Trust me, I get it.
I used to work in finance.

28:01.984 --> 28:04.683
Back in '08, all the bosses
promised big changes,

28:04.726 --> 28:07.686
but nothing really changes,
so I cashed out,

28:07.729 --> 28:08.904
took the kid,
moved here.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.645
Thing is, taking yourself
out of the game

28:10.689 --> 28:12.734
doesn't really
change the game.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.736
But I had to, for Caleb,

28:14.780 --> 28:17.739
who says moving here
ruined his life.

28:17.783 --> 28:20.873
Half the time,
we're at each other's throats.

28:20.916 --> 28:21.743
Well, I'm sorry.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.876
No,
we'll get through it.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.748
Melly, you have to prepare
yourself for something.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.794
What?

28:28.837 --> 28:32.101
There are things in this world
that aren't human.

28:32.145 --> 28:35.322
Shane Coogan was killed by one,
a djinn, I think.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.454
I'm sorry, a what?

28:37.498 --> 28:40.719
Monsters are real,

28:40.762 --> 28:43.156
and, given the number of
missing people in the area,

28:43.199 --> 28:46.942
I think this mine
may be a lair,

28:46.986 --> 28:49.249
and, if it is, I don't want you
to see what's inside.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.860
-But I don't want --
-Mom?

28:51.904 --> 28:54.080
Mom?

28:54.123 --> 28:55.864
Caleb!

28:55.908 --> 28:57.953
Oh!

29:05.439 --> 29:07.789
Steve was a good bunny.

29:08.877 --> 29:11.271
But Jessie needed his bones,
so.

29:14.143 --> 29:16.842
Yeah.
Sorry, that's, uh --

29:16.885 --> 29:18.321
Wow.

29:18.365 --> 29:21.977
I yelled at her, and she turned
my tongue into a snake.

29:23.936 --> 29:26.155
I still have the scars
where it bit me.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.031
You know what?
Listen.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.859
She doesn't
have to come back.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.948
All right?
You heard your mom.

29:35.991 --> 29:37.732
That spell
only works once.

29:37.776 --> 29:38.820
If you give it to me --

29:38.864 --> 29:42.955
She'd kill me.Not if you ran.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.392
Rowena was
a very powerful witch,

29:45.435 --> 29:46.915
maybe the most powerful
of all time.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.570
I'll give you her books,
her journals --

29:49.613 --> 29:50.832
whatever you want.

29:50.876 --> 29:54.009
Y-You could
go somewhere else,

29:54.053 --> 29:56.838
start over again.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.071
Liar!

30:23.082 --> 30:24.692
I know --

30:24.735 --> 30:26.650
I know I wasn't supposed to
be out here, but I --

30:26.694 --> 30:29.828
It's okay, honey.
Just tell us what happened.

30:29.871 --> 30:32.308
You're not gonna
believe me.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.006
Yes, we will.

30:34.049 --> 30:38.619
I saw some guy dragging
a dead body to the lake.

30:38.662 --> 30:41.143
I couldn't see his face,
so I grabbed my phone,

30:41.187 --> 30:44.059
I tried to bust his ass,
but...

30:44.103 --> 30:46.105
It was a monster.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.847
I-I ran, but I fell,

30:48.890 --> 30:51.153
I broke my phone
and messed up my ankle.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.244
I was hiding.

30:55.288 --> 30:57.116
I was so scared.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.641
The monster -- did you get
a good look at it?

31:00.684 --> 31:02.121
Sheriff Roy:
Yeah, he did.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.905
Unfortunately.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.820
Been looking for you.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.301
I try not to kill
more than I have to,

31:08.344 --> 31:11.826
but now you and the kid are
just such a big pain in my ass.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.176
You won't hurt them.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.267
That right?

31:22.968 --> 31:24.534
Whoa. Whoa.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.975
It's always you --

31:30.018 --> 31:33.892
you selfish little men
in positions of authority.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.851
You take what you want,
you take who you want.

31:36.895 --> 31:41.116
And you believe that your power
will protect you.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.557
Well, it won't protect you
from me.

32:22.114 --> 32:23.550
Let's go.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.117
Don't make me hurt you.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.082
Witch-killing bullets.

32:34.126 --> 32:36.215
Dean, wait, she's --

32:38.695 --> 32:41.611
Let her go,
or he dies.

32:41.655 --> 32:42.743
Well, it looks like
we got ourselves

32:42.786 --> 32:44.310
a little bit
of a stand-off.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.181
Two on two.

32:48.749 --> 32:51.099
More like two on three.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.508
Ad elicienda alvos.

33:08.551 --> 33:09.944
Torto ventre.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.946
Ad elicienda alvos.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.340
Torto ventre.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.257
The doll!
Kill him!

33:18.300 --> 33:20.563
Ad elicienda alvos.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.174
Torto ventre.

33:22.217 --> 33:25.003
Ad elicienda alvos.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.092
Torto ventre.Not today, bitch.

33:31.835 --> 33:33.185
About time.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.622
Ad elicienda alvos.

33:37.711 --> 33:41.497
Ad elicienda alvos.
Torto ventre.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.717
Ad elicienda alvos.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.285
Torto ventre.

33:46.328 --> 33:48.330
Ad elicienda alvos.
Torto ventre.

33:59.559 --> 34:01.430
Congelentur venae.

34:01.474 --> 34:05.434
Cor marcascatur et in thorace
concidatur.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.741
I'll grind your heart
to dust.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.830
Congelentur venae.

34:09.873 --> 34:14.052
Cor marcascatur et in thorace
concidatur.

34:14.095 --> 34:16.184
Con--

34:20.232 --> 34:22.016
You -- How?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.496
I learned
from the best.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.237
Start packing.

34:31.939 --> 34:36.248
O Ichor, igne putrefaciatur,

34:36.291 --> 34:40.165
ex sanguine flagrante,
te invoco.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.819
Eileen!

34:42.863 --> 34:45.213
Her -- Her body!

35:14.329 --> 35:15.504
Come on.

35:44.229 --> 35:45.404
So you --

35:45.447 --> 35:47.406
Dropped him
in the lake.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.669
I think I can help.

35:49.712 --> 35:52.280
May I?

36:20.526 --> 36:21.788
Holy crap!

36:26.445 --> 36:27.837
What -- What?

36:27.881 --> 36:31.450
That's a...miracle.

36:31.493 --> 36:35.280
Were you sent by God?

36:35.323 --> 36:37.673
Melly, I can't
explain it to you.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.632
I --

36:39.675 --> 36:41.199
Well, even if I could,

36:41.242 --> 36:43.026
I think you're better off
not knowing.

36:43.070 --> 36:45.246
What does that mean?

36:45.290 --> 36:47.335
It means
I'm happy I met you,

36:47.379 --> 36:49.337
and I'm glad
we found your son.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.386
But now you're leaving.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.474
Yeah.

36:55.517 --> 36:59.260
If I stay,
nothing changes.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.917
It's time for me to
get back in the game.

37:27.332 --> 37:32.293
Okay, so...
I just, um...

37:32.337 --> 37:33.773
get in?

37:33.816 --> 37:36.297
Yeah.
I guess.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.517
Then I say the words.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.163
Mortuum oritur.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.600
Rutum revertitur.

38:18.644 --> 38:21.995
Ex spiritu incarnatum est.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.867
Oriatur et educatur.

38:24.911 --> 38:28.784
Oriatur et educatur.

39:01.600 --> 39:05.038
Eileen?

39:15.614 --> 39:17.398
Sam?

39:46.471 --> 39:47.776
Thank you.

40:13.019 --> 40:14.586
How's Eileen?

40:14.629 --> 40:16.588
She, uh --

40:16.631 --> 40:18.285
She's asleep.

40:18.328 --> 40:20.243
She had a big day.

40:20.287 --> 40:23.551
Well, so did you.

40:23.595 --> 40:24.813
Hex bags.

40:24.857 --> 40:26.206
New body.

40:26.249 --> 40:28.556
So, what, are you
some kind of witch now?

40:29.775 --> 40:31.472
Nah, I got lucky.

40:31.516 --> 40:32.778
Yeah.

40:32.821 --> 40:35.694
I just wish we knew about
that spell for Mom.

40:37.696 --> 40:39.349
You did good today, man.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.917
I did jack.

40:41.961 --> 40:45.007
You killed a witch,
saved my ass.

40:45.051 --> 40:48.097
Yeah, I guess so.

40:48.141 --> 40:49.664
You know what,

40:49.708 --> 40:51.579
I've been thinking about
something you said,

40:51.623 --> 40:54.234
about how we don't make
the rules, and you're right.

40:54.277 --> 40:57.237
We don't.
We never have.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.239
But that doesn't mean
we can just give up.

40:59.282 --> 41:00.501
Oh, come on, man.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.590
We have moves to make here,
Dean.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.244
We do.

41:04.287 --> 41:06.725
I mean, you think Chuck
wanted me to shoot him?

41:06.768 --> 41:08.030
Of course not.

41:08.074 --> 41:09.728
You sure about that?

41:09.771 --> 41:12.470
Maybe that was part of the plan,
you know?

41:12.513 --> 41:14.515
That's the thing, man.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.648
I don't know what's God
and what isn't,

41:16.691 --> 41:19.520
and it's driving me crazy.

41:19.564 --> 41:22.567
All I'm saying is
we'll find a way to beat him.

41:24.786 --> 41:26.266
We will.

41:26.309 --> 41:28.442
I don't know how yet,
but we will

41:28.486 --> 41:31.532
'cause we're the guys
who break the rules.

41:34.100 --> 41:37.103
But I can't do it
without you.

41:37.146 --> 41:38.670
I can't.

41:38.713 --> 41:41.542
Just like I couldn't do it today
without you.

41:43.805 --> 41:45.546
I need my brother.
