943-66-2291. Pension Services, please.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.951
Thank you, Mr. Moses,
please hold for your representative.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.674
Hi, this is Sarah.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.115
It's Frank Moses.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.588
Hey. Frank. What's going on?

02:21.920 --> 02:23.273
Not much.

02:25.080 --> 02:29.119
I just called because
they didn't send that check out again.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.919
Oh. I can't believe
they haven't worked this out by now.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.514
I'll make sure they send
another one out today.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.158
I'm so sorry.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.271
Well, what are you gonna do?

02:41.840 --> 02:43.796
So how's your avocado?

02:43.880 --> 02:46.314
It's got two green leaves on it.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.719
Yay!

02:47.880 --> 02:49.757
I told you, you could grow something.

02:49.840 --> 02:53.196
Well, it was pretty close.
It was life or death.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.592
I'm not kidding.
It could have gone either way.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.159
How's your day going?

02:59.320 --> 03:02.756
My day? My day sucks.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.189
Your day sucks?

03:05.160 --> 03:06.149
Yeah.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.795
Right now I just want to travel.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.593
I'm thinking Chile.
Sounds like an adventure. I don't know.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.559
You ever been to Chile?

03:17.200 --> 03:18.235
Yeah.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.993
You have? What's it like?

03:20.760 --> 03:21.795
Mountains.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.789
That's it?

03:24.240 --> 03:25.719
Well, it was night, I...

03:26.880 --> 03:27.915
It was...

03:29.040 --> 03:30.109
Look, I gotta go.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.072
Okay. Sure.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.798
No, sorry, it's just Gladys.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.715
What?

03:39.600 --> 03:40.919
"It was night."

03:53.080 --> 03:54.399
Hi, Mr. Moses!

03:55.920 --> 03:56.955
Hi.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.029
- Did you start that new book?
- I did.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.639
And, what's it called?

05:14.840 --> 05:17.434
It's called Love's Savage Secret.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.228
Nice.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.475
Is it any good?

05:21.560 --> 05:24.597
It's terrible. I love it. It's awful.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.913
It's about this fashion designer

05:29.000 --> 05:32.834
and his supermodel girlfriend,
and they get recruited

05:32.920 --> 05:37.675
by the CIA to stop an assassination
at the Milan spring shows.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.072
Well, who doesn't like Milan in the spring?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.235
I guess.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.595
Anyway,
I gotta do something for excitement.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.590
My landlady keeps trying to set me up
with her bridge partners' kids.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.551
She just told me she thinks I'm gay.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.108
I try not to judge.

05:53.240 --> 05:57.392
What? Shut up! I'm not gay.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.519
So here's something weird.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.073
I'm actually gonna be
in Kansas City next week.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.988
In person?

06:08.280 --> 06:09.269
Mmm-hmm.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.032
Wow. That could be a bad idea.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.995
It could be.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.195
You still there?

06:21.720 --> 06:23.790
Yeah. Yeah.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.470
Why don't you call me
when you get to town?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.870
Or... Yeah.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.509
Okay. Bye.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.153
Okay, bye.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.157
Okay.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.595
All right.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.879
Come in, Unit One.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.314
Come in, Unit One.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.278
Unit One, respond.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.995
Don't you know I got to find me a home

10:56.080 --> 11:00.949
Right now in your heart

11:01.040 --> 11:05.238
I'll travel over miles...

11:05.320 --> 11:06.799
Hey, aren't you going to invite me in?

11:06.960 --> 11:08.837
No, I don't think so.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.439
But I bought you dinner!

11:13.080 --> 11:14.195
Wow.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.556
Wow! Wow!

11:24.760 --> 11:26.273
And you live with your mother.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.035
Awesome.

11:30.360 --> 11:34.239
Yeah, of course. You have no job.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.755
You, mister, are not getting any of this.

11:42.840 --> 11:43.909
Hey.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.032
It's me. Frank.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.435
The avocado?

12:01.440 --> 12:04.079
Why are you here? Get out of my house!

12:04.440 --> 12:05.793
- Hey!
- I told you to call first.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.279
I'm not gonna hurt you.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.757
Would you just listen to me? Please?
Stop that!

12:10.840 --> 12:12.751
Get back. Go away. Stay away from me!

12:13.640 --> 12:14.789
Is that my bag?

12:17.160 --> 12:18.195
Yeah.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.315
You packed it?

12:19.480 --> 12:20.515
Yes.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.359
Did you vacuum?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.558
A little, yeah, it was messy.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.994
Get back. Get out!

12:26.080 --> 12:28.799
Please. We have to leave.
Right now. Stop it.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.359
- Help! Help!
- Hey! Just listen to me, please!

12:30.720 --> 12:32.153
- Someone is trying to kill me.
- Help!

12:32.240 --> 12:33.958
- What are you doing? Listen to me!
- Intruder!

12:34.040 --> 12:36.110
- Help!
- They've been trying to kill you, too.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.559
Why would anyone want to kill me?

12:39.640 --> 12:40.755
Because we've been under surveillance.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.273
They've been listening
to our conversations.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.509
Why?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.353
Because of the way I talk to you.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.229
What?

12:51.920 --> 12:53.194
They know I like you.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.954
Listen to me. Right now. Out the back door.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.519
No way! No!

13:06.480 --> 13:08.471
Don't get me wrong,
I know it's crazy.

13:08.680 --> 13:09.829
Don't think that

13:10.560 --> 13:13.996
I don't think this is crazy.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.832
And it

13:17.560 --> 13:22.315
couldn't be more different than how
I'd hoped to meet you for the first time.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.317
But sometimes things happen.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.190
And I just hope that someday
you and I could be

13:30.840 --> 13:34.719
sitting somewhere, comfortably

13:35.280 --> 13:39.956
and look back on this
as the great, big adventure that it is.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.475
I'm a little hungry, too.
What should we get?

14:01.960 --> 14:03.109
Pizza.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.309
Listen, hon.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.679
Yeah, lots of boys get bullied at school.

14:14.160 --> 14:18.233
I know, but you can't solve it
by intervening like that.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.591
No, I don't agree with you.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.110
I know, it's hard.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.918
I'll talk to him about it when I get home.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.269
Mmm-hmm.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.271
No, I should be on time tonight.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.317
Milk, two percent? Okay, love you, bye.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.878
Listen. I can make you rich.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.833
Don't you know who I am?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.189
Of course, I do.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.750
This is off the books. Total blackout.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.593
Yes, ma'am.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.394
There's your target.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.268
Retired analyst.

15:38.680 --> 15:39.749
He was CIA.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.393
Is that a problem?

15:47.040 --> 15:48.155
No.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.869
The spark in your eye sets my soul on fire

15:52.960 --> 15:55.838
Your voice is like a angel above

15:57.200 --> 16:01.352
The touch of your hand, woman
Drives me insane

16:01.480 --> 16:04.870
But, baby, I want to be loved

16:06.680 --> 16:07.795
Sorry.

16:11.040 --> 16:16.194
Wow. If you let me go now,
I won't press charges.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.191
- There's no hard feelings.
- We're way past charges.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.316
How do I always attract losers like you?

16:22.600 --> 16:23.635
I was in the CIA.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.234
Yeah, I bet you were. I'll bet you're a spy.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.155
I have to go see someone now...

16:30.240 --> 16:33.152
You're just gonna make me sit here?
Like this?

16:33.240 --> 16:35.879
You couldn't be safer.
No one knows where you are.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.518
Oh, no. Don't do it.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.358
- Just hold still.
- Don't please. I don't want it.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.280
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.234
Your eyes are so beautiful.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.034
Want to watch TV?

16:58.280 --> 16:59.349
Be back soon.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.551
Is that thing acting up again?

17:07.119 --> 17:08.872
Oh, hi, Marna, yeah.

17:11.359 --> 17:14.032
Give it a rap, will ya?
See if you could get it going for me.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.791
Of course.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.952
I don't know
why you don't fix this old thing.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.439
Better picture.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.640
- Try a little bit more to the left.
- Okay.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.114
Yeah.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.955
That's just perfect.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.238
Thank you very much, Marna.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.194
Unbelievable.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.037
Should be ashamed of yourself.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.832
It's nice to see you, kid.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.434
It's good to see you, too.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.195
So what's up?

18:09.040 --> 18:10.268
Met a girl.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.839
No.

18:12.000 --> 18:12.989
Complicated.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.718
Got a visit from a wet team.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.797
At my house, 24 hours ago.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.873
Did you ID any of them?

18:25.240 --> 18:26.389
Kinda.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.397
This used to be a gentleman's game.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.553
And you know I love you. Bye.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.319
Independent South African hit team

19:08.440 --> 19:11.273
suspected of killing
a New York Times reporter.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.234
Stephanie Chan. You know her?

19:15.360 --> 19:16.679
No.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.873
Somebody has a serious
hard-on for you, kid.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.149
Yeah.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.280
But why now? I'm retired.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.753
Just have to dig some more.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.633
Watch your back, too.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.639
I'm 80 years old, I got stage 4 liver cancer.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.911
- What the hell can they do to me?
- They can still shoot you.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.113
Well...

19:46.120 --> 19:48.236
I never thought this would happen to me.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.555
What?

19:52.360 --> 19:53.679
Getting old.

19:55.560 --> 19:59.792
I mean, Vietnam, Afghanistan.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.953
Green Springs Rest Home?

20:08.960 --> 20:10.279
Go figure.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.519
So Moses made 22 calls
to Pension Services

20:25.600 --> 20:27.158
and that didn't stand out to you?

20:29.680 --> 20:31.079
Unbelievable.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.159
Hoorah.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.312
Have Endercott intercept the girl
at the Hotel Capri.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.238
Hey, Mike, change of plans.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.469
She's just fine.

21:02.800 --> 21:03.915
I can take you home.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.194
Oh.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.550
I gotta take you down to the station first
to get your statement.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.552
Then there's a couple of federal guys
that are gonna want to talk to you.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.598
I gotta say, I think you're pretty amazing
for breaking free

21:14.680 --> 21:16.398
and keeping it together like you did.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.471
That's impressive.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.310
I'm gonna go back and get my purse...

21:21.400 --> 21:22.913
I can have somebody
bring it downtown for you.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.274
- Get in the car!
- Ow!

21:24.600 --> 21:26.511
Let me go! You're hurting me.

21:33.800 --> 21:34.949
Am I gonna die?

21:35.040 --> 21:37.838
No. You just need some sleep.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.593
I may vomit.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.468
Wow, this is just like Love's Savage Secret.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.996
I am high.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.071
You have such beautiful green eyes.

22:23.440 --> 22:27.035
Wow. You really are CIA.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.839
Officer down.
Corner of North Peters and Conti.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.673
Suspect is a white male, 30s,
black suit and a tie,

22:37.760 --> 22:39.318
driving a black Tahoe.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.639
Freeze!
Put your weapon on the ground!

23:23.720 --> 23:25.438
Put your weapon on the ground now!

23:28.120 --> 23:29.519
Right now!

23:33.680 --> 23:36.831
So you're saying
this was CIA sanctioned?

23:37.120 --> 23:39.953
All right, Thelma, thanks.
I owe you one. Bye.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.952
So it's like that, huh?

23:57.360 --> 24:00.158
Yeah. It's like that.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.279
Where are we?

24:16.040 --> 24:19.271
How did we get to New York City?

24:23.040 --> 24:24.951
Wow, I really hate you right now.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.192
I was just hoping you'd be a little
more understanding of the situation.

24:28.320 --> 24:32.279
I was hoping not to get kidnapped.
Or drugged.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.675
I was hoping you'd have hair.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.518
So it looks like none of our dreams
are coming true, at the moment.

24:38.880 --> 24:39.949
Sorry about that.

24:41.520 --> 24:45.069
Thanks for saving me. I guess.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.474
No problem.

24:48.560 --> 24:51.632
Not my best first date.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.309
Not my worst, either.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.997
Until we find out who's trying to kill us,
you're gonna have to stay with me.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.795
For how long?

25:03.880 --> 25:04.869
I don't know.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.038
Whoever's trying to kill us
also killed a New York Times reporter.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.308
She used to live in Chinatown.

25:24.200 --> 25:28.478
Okay. Here we go. Let's come in here.
Right here. Wait a second.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.951
- You just hang onto this tape.
- Oh, no.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.792
No, you said we were just gonna talk to her.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.552
We are. This'll help.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.197
- The woman just lost her daughter.
- I know.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.430
You can't just go around
duct taping everyone.

25:39.800 --> 25:43.031
People are basically kind of decent.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.631
That hasn't always been my experience.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.632
Let me try and talk to her.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.600
- What?
- Just let me do it.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.158
They told me to be patient.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.155
The police have done nothing.

26:03.320 --> 26:08.155
They said it was just a burglary,
but nothing was missing.

26:08.480 --> 26:09.993
She was scared.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.151
We're hoping we can do more.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.957
You worked with my Stephanie?

26:26.160 --> 26:27.878
She sent me this.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.509
I got it in the mail on the day she died.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.193
What does this mean?

26:40.520 --> 26:41.635
I don't know.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.512
I tried dialing the numbers.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.919
Police had no idea.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.677
Where did Stephanie go to college?

26:52.280 --> 26:53.508
Why are we here again?

26:53.640 --> 26:55.790
Those numbers
on Stephanie Chan's postcard

26:55.880 --> 26:57.711
are actually a call number for a book.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.358
Call numbers start with letters.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.715
In the Library of Congress, yeah.

27:01.880 --> 27:05.429
In Harvard-Yenching,
it's a classification for Asian literature.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.998
How could you possibly know that?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.393
You speak Chinese?

27:37.880 --> 27:39.154
Unbelievable.

27:42.240 --> 27:45.232
Hank Maestriano died 2 weeks ago.
Car crash.

27:45.400 --> 27:49.598
Daniel McGinty. Heart attack. Last week.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.114
But if this is a hit list,

27:52.320 --> 27:56.552
why is this guy still alive? Gabriel Singer.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.751
Flies cargo planes.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.152
That's a good question.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.598
Hell of a mess.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.389
Come on.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.033
Joe Matheson, please.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.788
Hold on.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.469
Marna.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.028
Hello?

29:00.640 --> 29:01.629
What?

29:09.120 --> 29:10.109
Joe.

29:16.840 --> 29:20.355
Frank Moses is not a retired analyst
who's never worked in the field.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.792
This guy has a history.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.873
That's a file number.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.796
You need to visit the back room.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.317
You're going to meet the Records Keeper.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.955
I didn't even know this place existed.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.873
It doesn't.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.388
Ah.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.232
Frank Moses' file.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.231
You gotta be kidding me.

30:33.760 --> 30:37.912
Frank Moses was one of the most effective
black op agents we've ever had.

30:38.080 --> 30:41.072
He retired drug-lords, terrorists.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.351
Hell, he toppled governments.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.717
Yeah. He was truly gifted.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.039
Why was he retired?

30:51.280 --> 30:52.429
He got old.

30:53.360 --> 30:56.636
Then some thumb-sucker came along
and tagged him "RED."

30:56.720 --> 30:57.675
Red?

30:57.760 --> 31:01.753
Yeah. RED. R-E-D.
"Retired: Extremely Dangerous."

31:02.360 --> 31:03.429
Yeah.

31:03.760 --> 31:07.435
Yeah.
They don't make them like that anymore.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.439
Thanks.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.075
I'm gonna need a data haunt.

31:14.160 --> 31:16.674
Every flak he was ever involved in.
Every agent he's ever run.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.638
I want NSA telephone surveillance,
voice recognition...

31:25.320 --> 31:26.799
We have to find Marvin Boggs.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.230
Marvin died two years ago in a fire.

31:29.320 --> 31:32.232
Yeah. Marvin has died many times.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.951
Oh, can we have that one?

32:01.800 --> 32:04.234
Wow. All we need is a banjo.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.675
Keep your voice down.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.956
Don't make any sudden moves.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.991
Just stay close to me.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.355
- Don't use your cell phone.
- You took my cell phone.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.432
Don't talk about cell phones.
Don't talk about satellites.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.555
Seriously?

32:20.680 --> 32:21.829
Why are you trying to kill me?

32:22.600 --> 32:23.749
I'm not trying to kill you!

32:23.840 --> 32:24.955
Oh, yeah. You are.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.428
Why would I be trying to kill you?

32:26.640 --> 32:29.074
Because the last time we met,
I tried to kill you.

32:29.160 --> 32:30.354
That was a long time ago.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.874
Some people hold on to things like that.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.672
I'm not trying to kill you.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.155
Okay?

32:39.720 --> 32:41.358
So that makes us friends.

32:41.680 --> 32:42.715
Right?

32:44.560 --> 32:45.549
Right.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.875
Good.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.478
You wanna take that knife
out of my balls now?

32:55.720 --> 32:56.789
Who is she?

32:57.040 --> 32:59.474
Sarah. She's not trying to kill you either.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.879
Yeah. Hi.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.472
I don't stay in the open.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.516
Come on, I'll show you the house.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.908
What's that?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.069
Decoy.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.235
He lives in a car?

33:23.920 --> 33:25.069
Come on in.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.593
Why do you live here
when you have the other place?

33:39.760 --> 33:41.557
Let's put it this way.

33:41.760 --> 33:44.957
When the helicopter passed over
the house last year

33:45.560 --> 33:48.279
and I could feel their eyes on me.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.078
Wet like peaches.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.953
I have a list here.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.068
It was written by a reporter who's now dead.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.790
Along with everyone whose names
are on that list.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.518
Well, almost everyone.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.359
Frank, how many times have I told you?

34:07.480 --> 34:09.630
You cannot trust the system!

34:09.960 --> 34:14.954
I told you when you're in the system,
they switch the flip and you're done.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.755
Man, satellites, cell phones,

34:19.239 --> 34:23.233
chips, net, the web, the dentist...

34:23.320 --> 34:24.469
Marvin!

34:26.639 --> 34:29.757
That list is the one we need help with.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.315
Yeah, I gotta check the files.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.838
Of course you do. Thanks, man.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.429
Wow.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.478
This guy's insane.

34:44.800 --> 34:49.748
Well, he thought he was the subject of
a secret government mind control project.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.989
This'll take a minute.

34:51.239 --> 34:52.467
Sure.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.592
As it turns out,

34:55.280 --> 34:59.990
he really was being given daily doses
of LSD for 11 years.

35:00.200 --> 35:03.351
- In that case, he looks great. Yeah.
- Fantastic.

35:03.840 --> 35:07.389
Got it. Guatemala. Fall 1981.

35:08.320 --> 35:12.916
Five of the guys on this list were there,
not including us.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.639
San Benito. Just outside.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.149
Injun territory.

35:17.320 --> 35:21.279
Yeah. Was a little village.
Everybody was killed. Civilians.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.112
They told us, "Go in there. Clean it up.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.997
"Make it look like it never happened."

35:25.200 --> 35:27.760
You think everyone on this list was there?

35:29.360 --> 35:30.509
Damn it.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.029
Damn it!

35:32.560 --> 35:34.790
Do you know what's wrong
with this country?

35:36.840 --> 35:37.989
They're all trying to kill us?

35:38.240 --> 35:39.559
Exactly!

35:40.040 --> 35:42.554
Is there anybody still alive on that list?

35:44.200 --> 35:45.633
Gabriel Singer.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.034
Frank!

35:47.640 --> 35:49.835
I never thought I'd say this again.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.832
I am getting the pig!

35:59.760 --> 36:01.352
Who's she talking to?

36:02.840 --> 36:04.068
Just take it easy.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.230
Frank, we gotta get rid of this broad.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.039
I know a great place, just up the road.
Lots of alligators.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.071
We're not getting rid of the broad.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.038
I like her. Okay?

36:14.560 --> 36:16.676
What's the angle?

36:17.720 --> 36:18.948
No angle. I like her.

36:20.400 --> 36:24.439
Okay. So, they pull her voice
from the pay phone,

36:24.640 --> 36:26.119
probably right now,

36:26.280 --> 36:29.352
install the recognition software
and back-trace it to Singer.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.477
So then we show up,
they bring out the satellite,

36:32.560 --> 36:34.551
and we're fried with Y-rays.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.275
How you doing?

36:39.040 --> 36:40.268
Good, fine.

36:47.840 --> 36:51.355
November niner 745.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.997
Wow.
Singer is going to be in Mobile tomorrow.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.792
We can catch him at the airfreight terminal.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.149
How about that?

37:07.400 --> 37:10.119
The Sunset Limited
with service to New Orleans,

37:10.200 --> 37:14.637
Houston, Tucson and Los Angeles
now boarding platform five.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.070
It's the final boarding call
for the eastbound express...

37:25.320 --> 37:27.151
No, please! No!

37:27.360 --> 37:28.873
You smell like Washington.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.269
Who do you work for?

37:30.360 --> 37:32.828
Coldwell Banker, I'm a real estate agent!
Please, don't hurt me.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.911
No, no. Who do you work for?

37:35.120 --> 37:36.712
- What?
- Who do you work for?

37:36.800 --> 37:37.755
Marvin! Whoa!

37:37.840 --> 37:40.877
Frank, she's one of them.
She's been following us.

37:41.080 --> 37:44.117
There's a camera in her bag.
I'm gonna kill her now.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.669
No, please don't kill...
Don't let him kill me! Please!

37:48.480 --> 37:50.198
Marvin, just wait, would you, please?

37:50.360 --> 37:51.873
Marvin. Look. Marvin.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.635
No camera in the bag.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.510
Go, ma'am, now. Now.

38:03.800 --> 38:04.949
Get a car.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.714
Try not to kill anyone.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.430
She was following us, Frank.

38:24.560 --> 38:25.788
Sorry.

38:28.120 --> 38:31.715
"She has a camera in her purse,
we have to kill her?"

38:32.400 --> 38:33.799
Seriously?

38:39.560 --> 38:40.595
See you in a minute.

38:45.680 --> 38:46.749
Gabriel?

38:47.920 --> 38:49.478
Right? Gabriel Singer?

38:51.160 --> 38:52.195
What's this about?

38:52.360 --> 38:56.035
Guatemala. 1981. San Benito.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.189
I can't talk to you.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.513
Pair beats ace.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.273
I got one for you.

39:08.720 --> 39:11.837
What did this twice-decorated,
west Texas Jew-boy Marine pilot

39:11.920 --> 39:14.150
say to the Chinese
New York Times reporter?

39:14.240 --> 39:15.275
I give up.

39:15.360 --> 39:18.318
Nothing. I didn't tell her a damn thing.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.839
The reporter's dead now.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.473
And everyone she spoke to is either dead
or a target.

39:23.680 --> 39:24.874
That includes you.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.795
Oh, Christ.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.399
They had me fly this guy out there
in the dead of night.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.350
Hairy little airstrip in the middle of nowhere.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.997
He was CIA,
some dorky little spook in a suit and tie.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.229
Remember that guy?

39:41.320 --> 39:44.039
- Black glasses.
- Yeah. He was giving the orders.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.111
He picked up a package
and I flew him back out.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.189
What was the package?

39:47.320 --> 39:48.639
It wasn't a what.

39:48.800 --> 39:49.869
It was a who.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.069
Frank! Frank!

39:53.400 --> 39:54.799
It's that helicopter.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.110
We're in an airport. So...

39:57.280 --> 39:58.793
It's the same helicopter.

39:59.360 --> 40:04.309
November niner 748 Charlie.

40:04.560 --> 40:08.235
November niner 748 Charlie.

40:09.040 --> 40:12.794
See? Frank, November niner 748...

40:12.880 --> 40:13.915
Is that a 4?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.319
This is a 4. Charlie.

40:15.520 --> 40:17.431
Is that a 7? What is that?

40:17.560 --> 40:19.073
I'll tell you what it is.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.233
I told you she shouldn't
have made that phone call!

40:33.280 --> 40:34.349
We lost visual on target.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.919
All right. Shake the tree.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.275
- You'll pay for the breakage?
- Yeah, Roger that.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.117
That's right, old man!

41:03.840 --> 41:06.149
- Old man?
- No respect.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.435
Can I kill her now?

41:18.680 --> 41:20.079
She called me an old man.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.037
Pig! Open the pig!

41:30.240 --> 41:31.229
Okay.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.069
Grenade!

41:47.520 --> 41:48.919
Damn satellites!

41:50.000 --> 41:51.319
Boop to that!

41:54.640 --> 41:57.029
Yeah, you just stay right there.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.235
This is gonna be good.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.872
- You okay?
- Yeah.

42:17.040 --> 42:20.112
Come on, come on. Hey. All right?

42:21.520 --> 42:22.589
What are you doing?

42:59.480 --> 43:01.198
Old man, my ass.

43:01.360 --> 43:02.349
God damn it!

43:03.280 --> 43:06.158
- Smoke and thermals. Obstructed view.
- Signal's fading.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.153
Nice shot.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.030
- Thanks.
- We should get out of here.

43:31.840 --> 43:35.310
You really know how to show a girl
a good time, Frank.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.038
I will kill you, Marvin.

43:38.040 --> 43:41.874
Take it easy, man. She likes you.

43:48.080 --> 43:49.513
How can you tell?

43:51.640 --> 43:54.154
Notice how she sticks around?

43:54.360 --> 43:57.591
'Cause if women don't like you,
they don't stick around.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.030
She doesn't have much of a choice.
Does she?

44:00.400 --> 44:01.594
Sure she does.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.872
Really?

44:05.520 --> 44:06.714
You think so?

44:12.040 --> 44:14.156
You know, if it is the CIA,

44:15.240 --> 44:17.515
then there's only one place that we can go

44:17.600 --> 44:19.750
to find out why they're coming after us.

44:19.840 --> 44:20.875
Yeah.

44:21.080 --> 44:23.275
We're gonna get killed there, for sure.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.309
In or out?

44:25.400 --> 44:28.278
No. Of course I'm in. I'm just saying.

44:31.400 --> 44:33.436
We're gonna need some serious help.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.595
This is not the kind of help I meant, Frank.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.389
You're not actually gonna go in there,
are you?

44:46.120 --> 44:47.633
I don't think I can go, Frank.

44:47.720 --> 44:51.918
The last time they put some electrical wires

44:52.040 --> 44:54.235
in some not very nice places.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.316
Listen, hang onto that for me.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.239
I'll be right back.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.309
Hey.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.155
Be careful.

45:43.600 --> 45:47.673
Tell Ivan Simanov that Frank Moses is...

45:47.760 --> 45:49.876
Frank Moses is here to see him.

46:04.160 --> 46:06.310
I have to say

46:06.680 --> 46:11.071
this is the last thing I expected

46:11.320 --> 46:14.153
when I got up this morning.

46:19.680 --> 46:23.593
I have many times dreamed of killing you.

46:25.120 --> 46:26.439
But now

46:30.400 --> 46:32.311
you are

46:33.720 --> 46:35.631
a pensioner.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.598
Couple of years now.

46:38.960 --> 46:40.712
Time passes.

46:41.160 --> 46:44.596
As we get older,
things seem less important.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.273
Still

46:49.960 --> 46:51.552
I owe you

46:51.960 --> 46:54.076
for killing Igor.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.516
- Igor the Butcher.
- He was a great asset.

46:56.600 --> 46:59.592
- He was a pig.
- He was my cousin.

47:00.880 --> 47:01.915
I'm sorry.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.074
To Igor.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.399
The Butcher.

47:17.600 --> 47:18.919
He's not dead.

47:21.760 --> 47:22.829
I flipped him.

47:23.880 --> 47:24.949
No.

47:25.120 --> 47:27.395
He owns a string of 7-Elevens
in Orange County.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.834
He weighs 500 pounds.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.429
Drink.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.033
Who are we drinking to now?

47:48.400 --> 47:49.594
Veronique.

47:51.440 --> 47:54.159
She was mine.

47:55.280 --> 47:56.952
- Impossible.
- Yes!

48:05.040 --> 48:06.632
Whatever she got, it was worth it.

48:11.360 --> 48:12.679
I miss the old days.

48:16.760 --> 48:20.639
I haven't killed anyone in years.

48:22.520 --> 48:23.748
That's sad.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.155
But

48:31.520 --> 48:34.671
I think you are not here for the vodka.

48:39.280 --> 48:41.191
I'm going to break into the CIA.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.914
I need your complete
security layout of Langley.

48:45.520 --> 48:48.671
Cracks. Codes. ID swipes.

48:49.680 --> 48:50.749
All of it.

48:52.840 --> 48:55.912
Amusing as this would be,

48:56.880 --> 48:59.917
it is beyond my reach.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.311
A favor from Frank Moses?

49:20.880 --> 49:23.269
I can't believe you're actually
letting me come along.

49:23.920 --> 49:26.957
The badges Ivan gave us
are for a General Harlow

49:27.040 --> 49:30.157
and a female nuclear physicist
from Los Alamos.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.433
Sheniqua Johnson?

49:35.360 --> 49:36.429
You're adopted.

49:36.640 --> 49:37.755
Okay.

49:41.800 --> 49:44.234
This is so cool.

50:02.680 --> 50:03.715
- What?
- Uh-oh.

50:04.080 --> 50:06.230
I dropped it.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.159
Freeze!

50:13.840 --> 50:16.274
The General has dropped his contact lens.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.351
Perhaps you'd like to help us?

50:22.400 --> 50:23.833
Sorry.

50:30.240 --> 50:32.629
Found it! I found it!

50:33.680 --> 50:35.238
I found it.

50:48.800 --> 50:50.313
Have a good day, sir.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.068
Gentlemen.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.313
My God!

50:56.560 --> 51:00.235
What do you suppose the punishment
is for what we're doing here?

51:00.800 --> 51:02.153
Death.

51:03.480 --> 51:04.629
Maybe life in prison.

51:04.840 --> 51:06.239
Awesome.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.837
Why are you holding that button?

51:25.000 --> 51:26.592
The Russians give you the code?

51:27.120 --> 51:28.189
No.

51:29.440 --> 51:31.431
Changes every six hours.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.114
Will you hold that for me for a second?

51:33.200 --> 51:34.189
Yeah.

51:37.720 --> 51:39.199
It's unbreakable.

51:42.320 --> 51:43.719
Wow.

51:47.680 --> 51:48.829
Come on.

52:02.480 --> 52:03.959
Mr. Moses!

52:05.200 --> 52:06.997
Been a long time.

52:07.360 --> 52:09.510
I'm gonna need to see that Guatemala file.

52:09.880 --> 52:10.995
Guatemala?

52:11.520 --> 52:12.953
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

52:14.160 --> 52:15.559
I think I can help you.

52:16.720 --> 52:17.835
Great.

52:22.080 --> 52:25.038
It's been a whole new world
around here since you left.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.235
Guatemala.

52:32.920 --> 52:34.114
You know, you're gonna catch hell for this.

52:34.280 --> 52:35.838
After what I've seen?

52:38.240 --> 52:39.753
Oh, I should tell you,

52:40.040 --> 52:43.191
there's a new guy came down here
yesterday looking for your file.

52:43.400 --> 52:46.119
Name of William Cooper?

52:47.040 --> 52:49.235
6'1"? Cute hair?

52:50.400 --> 52:51.549
Hair was cute.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.990
But I thought he looked a little tough,
though.

52:58.400 --> 52:59.913
You take good care of yourself, Henry.

53:00.320 --> 53:02.117
You, too, Mr. Moses.

53:05.320 --> 53:06.309
Change of plan.

53:23.240 --> 53:24.593
Bad move, Grandpa.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.952
I'm back

53:35.520 --> 53:38.398
I'm back in the saddle again

53:39.480 --> 53:41.596
I'm back

53:43.400 --> 53:46.039
I'm back in the saddle again

53:46.160 --> 53:48.799
Just looks completely different
than his profile picture.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.629
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore

53:57.720 --> 54:01.679
Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more

54:01.800 --> 54:05.759
Fools' gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet

54:05.840 --> 54:10.436
Not tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

54:11.160 --> 54:12.229
Kordesky trained you?

54:12.360 --> 54:13.395
Yeah.

54:13.520 --> 54:14.999
I trained Kordesky.

54:17.440 --> 54:19.158
I'm back

54:21.160 --> 54:24.869
I'm back in the saddle again

54:38.720 --> 54:39.869
Son of a bitch!

54:45.960 --> 54:48.030
Seal the building. Bald, white male, 50s,

54:48.120 --> 54:50.554
wearing white shirt, blue pants,
shot in the shoulder.

54:57.800 --> 54:58.835
Hi.

55:00.440 --> 55:01.475
We should go.

55:02.200 --> 55:03.315
We should go now.

55:31.200 --> 55:33.634
I've got checkpoints at every exit.
What about the fire?

55:33.760 --> 55:36.320
Shut off the alarm.
I told you, there is no fire!

55:38.640 --> 55:40.995
- We need to evacuate.
- No, this is just a diversion.

55:41.080 --> 55:42.798
You make sure everyone gets checked.

55:44.720 --> 55:48.269
Help, help! Please come!

55:48.880 --> 55:50.711
I can't stop the bleeding.

55:55.520 --> 55:56.589
You okay, sir?

55:57.040 --> 55:58.109
Make a hole!

55:58.560 --> 55:59.879
Make a hole!

56:00.320 --> 56:02.629
Whoa! Hold it. Let me see him.

56:03.920 --> 56:04.955
It's not him.

56:07.960 --> 56:09.075
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

56:09.520 --> 56:11.033
Fellas, help me out, here.

56:29.720 --> 56:30.914
Marvin?

56:37.160 --> 56:39.390
There's still something wrong
with this guy's head, Frank.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.438
You're really something, Joe.

56:48.320 --> 56:49.469
Marvin, you okay?

56:49.640 --> 56:51.153
I don't want to talk about it.

56:53.840 --> 56:56.115
Joe? Joe who was dead Joe?

56:57.000 --> 56:58.558
- She with us?
- Yeah.

56:59.880 --> 57:01.029
Not dead.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.315
Just retired.

57:10.320 --> 57:11.753
I guess calling wasn't an option?

57:11.840 --> 57:13.671
- Can we go?
- Yeah!

57:13.840 --> 57:15.034
You let yourself get shot?

57:15.920 --> 57:17.114
God damn it.

57:18.600 --> 57:19.749
Out.

57:20.720 --> 57:22.153
- You okay?
- Thanks, Doc.

57:22.480 --> 57:23.629
What did he get?

57:26.880 --> 57:28.598
I have no idea.

57:29.360 --> 57:33.717
You just had your ass handed
to you by a goddamn retiree.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.153
What did he do?

57:39.400 --> 57:41.868
What did Moses do to earn a lethal finding?

57:41.960 --> 57:44.155
I have not been read into it.

57:44.760 --> 57:47.399
I like you, Cooper.
You're ambitious and you get results,

57:47.600 --> 57:50.512
but someone just kicked in
the front door of our house,

57:50.600 --> 57:52.716
so you better get your shit straight.

57:53.040 --> 57:55.395
Nothing in your mission is changed.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.799
- You're still bleeding.
- Mmm-hmm.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.391
Must have nicked something in there.

58:02.720 --> 58:04.312
This is so bad.

58:04.400 --> 58:07.392
It's not that bad.
People get shot all the time.

58:07.480 --> 58:09.755
No, they don't, they get paper cuts.

58:09.920 --> 58:11.114
I mostly get shot.

58:11.200 --> 58:14.158
We're gonna have to find somebody
to plug this leak.

58:19.200 --> 58:20.918
Could go to Eagle's Nest.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.269
Huh?

58:22.600 --> 58:23.953
Then we all get shot.

58:25.600 --> 58:27.079
I'll just go in by myself.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.075
Want a vest?

58:32.160 --> 58:33.718
Wouldn't do any good.

59:10.280 --> 59:11.633
Frank Moses.

59:12.920 --> 59:14.239
Hi, Victoria.

59:19.360 --> 59:20.918
Are you here to kill me?

59:22.160 --> 59:23.229
No.

59:27.400 --> 59:28.628
You've been shot.

59:37.120 --> 59:39.554
Tell Marvin to stand down
before he gets hurt.

59:49.760 --> 59:50.988
Who's the girl?

59:51.520 --> 59:52.509
She's with me.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.512
- Vicky.
- Joe!

59:54.600 --> 59:57.558
Oh, Vicky. Sexy as ever.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.512
You old snake charmer.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.509
Sarah, this is Victoria.
Best wet work asset in the business.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.109
And a true artist with an RPN.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.719
What's that?

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.878
I kill people, dear.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.314
You were lucky.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.839
How'd you do it?

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.154
- What?
- How'd you make the transition?

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.831
Here you seem so calm. At ease.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.359
I love it.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.913
I love it here. I love the baking.
I love the flower arranging.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.039
I like the routine.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.549
Well...

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.591
- I do get a bit restless sometimes.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.591
I take the odd contract on the side.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.675
I just can't stop.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.636
Yeah. Tell me about it.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.154
You can't just flip a switch
and become someone else.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.799
Put some pressure on it.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.433
So...

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.398
Tell me about your lady friend.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.795
Makes me think that I could actually

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.474
have a life.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.794
A real life.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.196
Oh, Francis, you're such a romantic.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.509
What?

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.875
A romantic.
It's why I've always been so fond of you.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.949
Victoria...

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.713
You're all hard on the outside,
but you are...

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.676
You are gooey on the inside.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.113
Gooey.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.192
The entire back half of the Guatemala file
has been blacked out.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.033
But there's a list. 11 names.
Plus one that's been redacted.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.829
All dead. Except for Frank and Marvin.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.839
All the names on the reporter's list
are in the file, too,

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.831
but she has an additional name.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.469
Alexander Dunning.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.718
Somebody's protecting him.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.269
Dunning is the CEO of Browning-Orvis.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.475
Gangsters.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.069
Defense contractor.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.515
Very connected.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.157
If the CIA is protecting him,

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.352
he's under surveillance.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.789
We could go see him.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.319
You're not going without me.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.829
Well...

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.677
We're getting the band back together.
That's nice.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.395
Yeah?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.034
We just got a tip. RED has a new target.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.709
A tip?

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.994
FBl's on the scene.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.479
I'm on my way.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.192
The FBl has a lookout position
on the east perimeter.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.989
Copy that.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.239
Alexander Dunning.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.079
Pleasure to see you, Secretary Baptiste.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.957
The pleasure is with me.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.068
They're in.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.757
Frank said you wanted me with you.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.878
Yes, I thought it might be nice
to have a bit of girl time together.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.913
Get to know each other.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:20.231
And I just wanted to tell you that
in all the years I've known Francis,

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.759
I've never seen him like this.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.551
So if you break his heart,

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.233
I will kill you.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.557
And bury your body in the woods.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.633
Wow.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.833
Okay.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.636
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.831
Here at Browning-Orvis,

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.193
we have a longstanding commitment
to humanitarian causes

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.797
because exemplary corporate citizenship
is our highest calling.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.669
As a company with global reach
and global interests,

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.797
we have global responsibilities.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.559
Now sometimes I'm asked,

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.992
if this commitment to ethical behavior
affects the bottom line.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.998
And my answer is always the same.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.235
Yes.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.916
It makes it stronger.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.113
This is my safe room.
Sound-proofed. Reinforced.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.197
Swept for bugs daily.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.033
You could fire a gun in here.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.993
No one would ever know.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.079
Mr. Dunning.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.355
I cannot imagine a more perfect place
to conduct our business.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.310
You do know that there's

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.235
a surcharge

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.797
for any arms deliveries

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.352
to countries that are embargoed
by the United Nations.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.676
For every problem, monsieur,

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.119
there is a solution.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.078
Excuse me.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.559
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.869
What are...

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.317
How many CEOs can say that?

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.872
So how did you guys meet?

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.350
We started talking on the phone.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.599
I guess I liked that it wasn't real.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.469
Of course now I'm a fugitive,

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.279
the CIA wants to kill me
and I'm hiding in a hole.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.390
I was in love with an agent once.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.913
What happened?

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.310
Well, I was with Ml6.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.351
And the relationship wasn't

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.558
sanctioned.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.797
So when it came to light,
my loyalty was questioned.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.433
And I was ordered to kill him.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.194
It was a test.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.753
What did you do?

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.630
I put three bullets in his chest.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.674
Okay.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.358
Who the hell are you guys?

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.879
You don't remember us?

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.269
We remember you.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.110
You're the guy whose shit we cleaned up
down in Guatemala in 1981.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.988
And the question is,
who did you fly out of there?

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.870
You don't have any idea
what you're getting into.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.913
First of all,

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.594
you can't touch me.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:28.989
Sure, we can.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.353
Oh, yeah.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.754
Where'd you get this?

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.313
Home Depot.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.120
- How much?
- Ten bucks.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.911
You want nuts?

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.394
Nipples?

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.635
Potty trainer?

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.839
All right, stop it.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.075
Nuts.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.037
Stop it. For the love of Christ, stop it!

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.473
Stop already!

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.674
Now you got something to say?

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.271
We extracted a young lieutenant

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.432
who is the son of the late Senator,

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.996
James Stanton.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.349
Robert Stanton?

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.790
Vice President of the United States.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.788
You're saying the Vice President
killed all the people in that village?

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.678
Yeah. Went completely off the reservation.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.791
And that New York Times reporter?

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:36.629
Did she pressure you?

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.229
Yeah. She called me. Twice.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.393
So I called the V. P.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.393
And what did you think
would happen then?

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.038
Oh, whatever.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.198
I made him Vice President.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.513
You kept your mouth shut
and the Stantons made you rich.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.669
Been working with

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.795
our partners in the developing world

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.359
to root out corruption and...

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.314
Okay.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:05.233
I will pay whatever it costs

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.198
to get rid of this thing.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.437
We're not here for your money, home.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.269
We're here because that New York Times
reporter had the list of names

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:16.675
of everybody who was in Guatemala.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.992
And everybody on that list
has been ordered killed.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.314
Except you.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.598
I had nothing to do with that.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.192
Don't you see?

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.794
He's trying to clean up his past
and get rid of me in one shot.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.676
He's trying to cut me loose
before he runs for President.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.956
We have some
major activity out here.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.675
Looks like we're blown.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.959
We're in position.
Perimeter's set. No one's getting out.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.792
They're moving a team up the east side.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.399
Are you gonna let me talk to them?

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.550
I can negotiate something.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.518
Thanks, when we want your help,
we'll get out the drain cleaner.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.790
Listen, Plastic Man,

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.395
those bastards out there
probably have orders to kill me, too.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.635
I hope so.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.276
Why? 'Cause I'm a bad guy?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.433
I'm scum?

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.073
Can I just shoot him now?

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.469
No.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.148
You don't have people killed.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.791
I have people killed,
I'm the bad guy. Remember?

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.839
Not worth a bullet.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.109
Hello?

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.594
How's retirement, Frank?

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.672
It's been a real blast.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.189
If we have to come in there and get you,
it's gonna be messy.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.068
You bet. Real messy.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.073
I've got my orders, Frank.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.993
They come from the Vice President.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.949
He's ordered these hits to cover up
the war crimes he committed in Guatemala.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.633
I find that hard to believe.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.831
How did you know you'd find me here?

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.275
Some anonymous untraceable tip?

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.032
Here's the deal, Frank.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.358
You're gonna walk out that front door
and give yourself up.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.755
You have my word no one will shoot you.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.555
I'll personally take you in and
you will get to tell your side of the story.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.390
You got 60 seconds to decide.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.589
What's it look like?

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.193
There's no clean exit.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.796
They seem to be coming from everywhere.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.389
If we had a distraction,
I could cover you to the woods.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.879
Looks like there's not a lot of options, kid.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.029
I mean

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.156
somebody's gonna have to make
the hard choice

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.593
if we're gonna get out of here alive.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.759
Been wild.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.078
Wild and crazy.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.595
But I wouldn't want it any other way.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.279
An honor.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.793
Good luck.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.473
Tell your men to hold their fire.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.989
I'm coming out.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.474
He's coming out. All units, hold fire.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.551
Repeat, all units, hold fire.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:16.949
Roger that.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.794
Get behind.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.471
Come out now. I've got you covered.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.554
Who fired the shot?

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.555
Tell me when the boys make cover,
we'll move.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:16.595
Now.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.678
They've got Sarah.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.872
Frank, you're no good to her dead.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.274
We gotta move.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:05.429
Come!

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.670
Now is not time to waste.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.474
Ivan?

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.469
It's nice to see you again, Ivan.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.913
Did he just call you "bunny"?

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.557
Life sometimes is complicated.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.073
To Joe.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.753
Joe.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.431
Not to push the bounds of propriety,

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.392
but don't you think
we ought to discuss the fact that

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.234
the CIA's being used by the Vice President
as his personal hit squad

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:58.670
and that they'll do whatever they can
to find us and kill us?

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.068
Options?

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.758
We could go public.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.272
Yeah, right.
That didn't work very well for the reporter.

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.397
And what about Frank's girlfriend?

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.193
They'll kill her so fast.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.515
First they'll interrogate her.
They probably already got the wires.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.876
Then give her a little snorkel.
Give her a jump.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.672
- Bring in the dent.
- Marvin!

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.272
God! You are such an idiot.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.193
I want to show you something.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.917
This was done to me by the love of my life.

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.034
It seems that what we had
was not meant to be.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.435
But now she sits

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.356
outside my house

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.916
drinking vodka.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.549
Three bullets in the chest.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.118
When I woke alive,

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.071
I knew she still loved me.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.240
Or else it would have been the head.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.153
It was big risk for her, of course,

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.391
but one does crazy things for love.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.398
Do not fear for your love, my friend.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.389
With a small dedicated group,

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.399
there is nothing
that cannot be accomplished.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.039
Let me be blunt.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.398
Nobody knows you're here. You don't exist.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.952
And unless you cooperate fully,

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.436
there's nothing I can't do to you.

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.911
- Sir.
- Not now.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.752
Moses is on the phone.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.637
Okay. Trace is running.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.635
Moses.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.559
Here's the thing, Cooper.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.271
With age comes a certain perspective.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.871
I'd be a liar if I said there wasn't a time
when I was exactly like you.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.753
Blind ambition.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.394
Misplaced trust.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.352
Why are you telling me this?

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.272
It might help me to decide what to do next.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.429
Just keep it going.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.232
Why? What are you thinking about?

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.950
Our business is a very hard one.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.799
But it was never

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.990
the killing or the stress,

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.912
or the bad pay that bothered me.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.111
What was it, Frank?

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.438
It's how anything that you love

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.514
can be taken away from you.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.597
It taught me never to care.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.149
Never to invest.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.637
Then I met this woman.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.833
Sarah.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.679
And now you have her.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.278
Now I can't think of anything
more horrible

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:13.155
than to know that your enemies
can hurt someone that you love.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.518
The feeling is almost indescribable.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:24.119
You still there, Cooper?

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.354
You're at my house.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.751
Almost indescribable, isn't it?

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.749
Please.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.273
Please don't hurt my family.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.198
If anything happens to Sarah,

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.515
I will rip everything you love
out of your life.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.479
And then I'll kill you.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.030
I swear to you, I will keep Sarah safe.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.192
We don't have much time.

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.759
Do you understand that?

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.439
What are you gonna do, Frank?

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.071
I'm gonna kill the Vice President.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.919
What are you gonna do?

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.234
Move! Move!

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:27.595
Mom!

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:36.759
Frank left this for me.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.478
Where did he get it from?

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:45.157
The secure records depository of the CIA.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.671
Look, Sarah.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:01.995
I know Frank's been right
about a few things.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.191
But he's about to cross a line
from which there's no turning back.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.829
Right now,
you have an opportunity to help him.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.230
You need to tell me everything you know.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.671
Because if I can't stop him,

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.588
I'm gonna have to kill him.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:30.475
Do you know who Frank Moses is?
I mean, really is?

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.236
Do you know what he's done?

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.833
Wow.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.954
You're asking me for help? That is so lame.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.837
He's gonna eat you for lunch.

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.188
She's never gonna trust us.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:57.239
I can't blame her. The tip off was a trap.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.715
Someone's got us dancing like marionettes.

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.516
Just like Moses called it.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.515
Yeah.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.112
He will take a shot at the V. P.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.916
That's a problem for the Secret Service.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.835
Moses'll take them apart.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.594
Plug me into their detail.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.713
You got it.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:28.629
What about her?

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.876
I'll keep her close. Protected. Off the grid.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.308
I put a few things away.

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.599
Just in case.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.709
Frank.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.232
Swedish K.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.754
Now that is exciting.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.229
Explosives?

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:01.954
Just past the RPGs.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.795
I love you, man.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.398
- Make yourself at home.
- The Vice President's gonna love this.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.592
Nice to see you, too.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.435
Thank you.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.675
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.829
Sorry. Silly.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.715
Thank you, ma'am.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.589
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.711
Welcome, Ms. Brown.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.309
Mmm-hmm.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.355
It's a pleasure to have you
at our Victory Fund Gala.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.556
Oh, I'm so looking forward to it.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.919
Raptor is cleared for entry.

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.392
After you, Mr. Vice President.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.390
A true war hero,
a fabulous friend and a wonderful leader.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.436
And so it's with great pleasure
I introduce to you,

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.196
Vice President Robert Stanton.

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.079
I love you, sir!

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.752
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you so much for being here.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.433
I'm gonna keep this short and sweet

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.670
so you'll actually write those checks
you've been promising.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.996
Seriously, though, great to see you all.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.239
It's the wonderful people here tonight

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.072
that got us into the White House
in the first place.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.355
And I believe
it's this wonderful group of people

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.557
who will keep us there
for a long, long time!

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.797
My good friends,

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.719
I am proud to announce that I will
be forming an exploratory committee

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:52.349
with the primary goal of seeking
a nomination for the Presidency.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.118
We've had a great journey together.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:09.359
But I firmly believe
that the best is still to come.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.673
God bless you all.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.752
God bless America!

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.194
Mmm?

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.519
Hello, bunny.

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.070
Moves like that could get you killed.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.395
Your radiance tonight
renders me almost speechless.

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.515
Almost.

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:53.079
What are you grinning at?

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.230
I've always dreamed
of killing an American President.

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.515
Vice President.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.029
Whatever.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.239
Having you in my arms once again,
I get carried away.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.515
Really?

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.314
Tell me you love me.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.951
It's been a long time, Ivan.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.794
Blink of an eye.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.478
- Ivan.
- Mmm?

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.391
The music has stopped.

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.554
Is it?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.115
Ah.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.233
To work then.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.675
Ivan!

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.119
Do you smell that?

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.070
- This area is off limits.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.395
You'll have to turn around.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.112
No, it's fine.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.312
It's all right. I'm sure I'm allowed.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.472
You'll have to go back up, ma'am,
or I'll have to treat you as a threat.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.959
Where exactly is the threat?

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.993
Good to see you.

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.399
Oh, my God!

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.474
Gas! I smell gas!

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.915
Gas! Gas!

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.355
Gas!

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.514
Stand aside.

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:13.276
Primary exit blocked. Secondary, move.

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.998
Move! Move! Move!

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.030
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.155
Go.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.393
What the hell are they using?

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.069
Get back up in here
to the north stairwell, now!

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:53.999
Ah, yes.

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.437
Move to the other limo. I'll cover you.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.029
We have to go. Now! Now!

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.638
Approaching target from the rear.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.548
Outside!

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.079
Secret Service,
everybody down!

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.115
Cover us! We're moving now!

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:36.878
Come on! Move!

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:37.989
Go!

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:46.193
I remember
the Secret Service being tougher.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.429
Me, too.

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.113
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.388
Marvin.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:05.708
Bugger!

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:37.633
- Almost there.
- Marvin.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:38.949
We gotta move.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.070
You're on your own. I'm no use anymore.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.591
Good luck. Go on.

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.512
Let's move!

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.519
Are you hit, sir?

01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.110
- Are you hit?
- I'm fine! Just get me the hell out of here.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:20.555
Perhaps I could be of assistance?

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.754
I love you.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.388
I know.

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:45.909
Freeze!

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:53.589
What the...

01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:58.554
Go. Go!

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:01.875
Go!

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.154
Get in! Get in!

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.909
Go, go, go!

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.675
Stop the car! Stop...

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.398
Don't you dare stop! You keep going!

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.471
Stop the car! Pull over!

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.876
I wanna know
what the hell that was all about!

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.271
- Burbacher!
- Get him off!

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.078
Pull over!

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.591
Raptor is secure.

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.714
Who are you?

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.751
One of the men you ordered killed.

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.555
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.478
Guatemala.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.199
I was there.

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.835
Well...

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.148
I'm sure we can negotiate something.

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.357
Starting to come back to you now, is it?

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.351
If you're looking for revenge...

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.631
This is not about revenge.

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.751
Are you gonna kill me?

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:09.634
Not just you.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.029
Yeah?

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:24.156
I'm at the Evanston power plant.

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.750
You have 15 minutes to bring me Sarah.

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:29.115
Or I kill the Vice President.

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.311
He just made contact. He wants the girl.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.153
Evanston Power Station. 15 minutes.

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.313
You better alert Secret Service.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.675
Copy that.

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:44.790
Secret Service is en route.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.679
All right, come on.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.319
Where's Sarah?

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.039
She's on her way.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.912
It's over, Frank.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.875
Any minute
the whole world is gonna drop on you.

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:20.279
We'll see.

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.554
Hey, tough guy.

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.639
Surprised to see me?

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.355
What the hell's this?

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.515
Alex...

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:57.755
Just give him what he wants.
I can't do this anymore.

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.916
You ordered these killings, not me.

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.549
I don't want to have
anything to do with this anymore.

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.759
You shot me.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.159
Shut up.

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:23.113
I loved watching you being a good guy.

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:27.113
Kicking ass for your country.

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.358
It showed a spectacular lack of vision.

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:33.749
The girl goes free.

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.158
That'll cost you a gun.

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.118
A life for a life.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.476
I tore up all those checks.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:52.079
I know.

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:56.959
I just wanted to talk to you.

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.149
Cooper,

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:07.469
cuff him.

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.910
Wilkes told me you had promise.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.275
Okay, here's how it goes.

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:27.994
Moses just shot the V. P.

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.396
You kill him and the girl,

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.154
and you're head of the CIA.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.069
Cooper.

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.397
This is gonna happen either way.

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.353
Fuck you, Cynthia.

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.559
Thanks.

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.913
This gonna be a problem?

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:54.989
No.

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.149
I got it...

01:42:58.760 --> 01:42:59.988
Grandpa.

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.429
Feel better now?

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.755
Yeah.

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.237
Wanna get pancakes?

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:21.993
Can you believe it? It all worked out.

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.630
Something bad is gonna happen very soon.

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.470
Maybe not. Wait a second.

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.919
Nobody's chasing us.

01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:34.310
No one's trying to kill us.

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:37.840
I think we just got our lives back.

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.074
Almost.

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.750
You still owe me a small favor.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:44.955
Oh, Ivan!

01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.633
His timing is terrible.

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.230
You gave a favor to him?

01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:54.272
Just a tiny little nuclear problem
in Moldova.

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.309
Can we go?

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.593
Yes. We can go.

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.675
I told you
something bad was gonna happen.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:37.233
Keep your dress on.

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:40.912
Moldova sucks.

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.599
Moldova sucks!

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:46.509
Next time,
your girlfriend can wear the dress.
