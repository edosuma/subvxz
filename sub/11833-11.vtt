WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.636
Ready?

00:02.669 --> 00:03.670
Almost.

00:03.703 --> 00:04.738
We should get going.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.106
Okay, take it easy.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.373
I am taking it easy.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.142
Okay,
is this a coffee thing,

00:09.175 --> 00:10.376
or is this
an ex-boyfriend thing?

00:10.410 --> 00:12.378
Ellenor.

00:12.412 --> 00:15.782
Lindsay, Pinkner
vs. Willams Breyland
Tobacco Company?

00:15.816 --> 00:18.484
Oh, yeah, uh,
she's a friend of mine.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.753
You actually
took this case?

00:19.786 --> 00:21.254
LINDSAY:
It'll be a winner, Bobby.
Maybe not a lot of money --

00:21.287 --> 00:22.355
BOBBY: A winner?

00:22.388 --> 00:24.090
You're suing
a cigar manufacturer

00:24.124 --> 00:25.225
for breaking up
a marriage?

00:25.258 --> 00:26.392
What?

00:26.426 --> 00:28.562
LINDSAY: Emotional distress.
Basically...

00:28.595 --> 00:31.431
alienation of affection.
Lindsay.

00:31.464 --> 00:32.732
A couple of depositions. I mean
if we don't settle then --

00:32.766 --> 00:35.268
BOBBY: How does a cigar
come between a husband
and a wife?

00:35.301 --> 00:37.270
That's a question of fact.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.540
Aren't the partners
supposed to approve
new cases?

00:39.573 --> 00:43.143
It's two days of discovery,
tops, and you are not a partner.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.545
Thanks for reminding me.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.180
I am, and how does
a cigar company --

00:47.213 --> 00:48.081
Aren't you late for trial?

00:48.114 --> 00:49.783
Well, actually,
I have a few minutes.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.317
Yeah, me, too.

00:51.351 --> 00:52.653
How much time do you plan
to spend on this?

00:52.686 --> 00:53.787
Hey, it's for a friend, okay?

00:53.820 --> 00:56.156
It's two depositions, maybe
a summary judgment motion --

00:56.189 --> 00:56.990
BOBBY: Now it's court time?

00:57.023 --> 00:57.624
ELLENOR: That's
20 hours minimum.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.459
I will get money out of it.

00:59.492 --> 01:02.162
I beat the tobacco company once.
I will do it again.

01:02.195 --> 01:04.497
Thank you all very much
for your support.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.399
Maybe one day you people
will have friends in your life

01:06.432 --> 01:08.168
that you'll wanna help,
and when you do,

01:08.201 --> 01:09.269
I'll remember this.

01:09.302 --> 01:10.737
Definitely wedding stress.

01:12.372 --> 01:14.340
My first instinct
was to say nothing.

01:14.374 --> 01:15.475
Totally.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.212
(music playing)

02:08.562 --> 02:11.632
Is, uh...
everything okay?

02:11.665 --> 02:13.767
It's fine. It's just,

02:13.800 --> 02:16.336
you guys just started
to gang up, that's all.

02:16.369 --> 02:19.305
Your reaction
was a little heightened.

02:19.606 --> 02:20.607
Sorry.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.844
I'll try to settle this
as fast as I can, okay.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.812
Okay. Lindsay...

02:27.213 --> 02:30.617
I, um, I think something
is going on here.

02:33.353 --> 02:34.721
Talk to me.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.356
You'll just laugh.

02:36.389 --> 02:37.891
I won't laugh.
Tell me.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.227
(sighs) Okay.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.597
I need more sex.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.568
Oh, great.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.736
You -- You need more --

02:49.770 --> 02:51.271
Yes.

02:51.304 --> 02:52.706
I don't think you're
attracted to me anymore.

02:52.739 --> 02:53.940
Are you crazy?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.742
It's just we don't --
not nearly like --

02:55.776 --> 02:57.944
It tapers off a little
with all couples.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.379
We're not even married yet.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.648
You don't think I want
to make love to you?

03:01.682 --> 03:03.617
1.6 times a week.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.852
Last year it was 3.9.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.891
Y-You do the math?

03:10.924 --> 03:13.660
Bobby,
I have a deposition.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.228
We'll talk about this
later, okay?

03:16.262 --> 03:18.231
(door slams)

03:21.401 --> 03:23.203
(elevator bell dings)

03:23.937 --> 03:25.371
We hit a bump.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.273
Helen Gamble
doesn't want you in uniform.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.274
The judge agreed.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.543
I'm a cop.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.411
On leave, and if the department
says you can't wear it, then --

03:31.444 --> 03:32.679
This is ridiculous.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.915
Well, they're giving you
an hour to change.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.017
ELLENOR: They did make an offer.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.251
What?

03:38.284 --> 03:39.953
Reckless endangerment.
Six months.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.688
I'd have to serve?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.389
Well, a kid died.

03:43.423 --> 03:44.525
Doing my job.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.459
Actually,
you were off duty.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.394
Rebecca?

03:48.428 --> 03:49.663
I'd turn it down.

03:49.696 --> 03:50.964
Hey, hey. Hold on.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.398
He thought the kid pulled a gun,

03:52.432 --> 03:53.166
Ellenor, and it looked
like a robbery.

03:53.199 --> 03:55.435
I understand our defense,
Rebecca,

03:55.468 --> 03:57.638
but if we lose on murder two,
we're looking at life.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.573
Tell the D. A. No.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.275
I was doing my job.
I'll go to the mat saying so.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.546
Okay. I'll tell her.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.780
Go change.

04:11.351 --> 04:14.054
Rebecca, right now
he needs you to be his lawyer,

04:14.087 --> 04:15.421
not his ex-girlfriend.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.290
Ellenor, don't use
that tone with me.

04:17.322 --> 04:19.560
Reckless endangerment
would be a good result.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.427
If he were guilty, yes,
but he's innocent.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.396
He shot an unarmed kid.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.331
Who he thought was about
to commit a crime,

04:25.365 --> 04:26.967
and the kid
did have a gun on him.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.603
All I'm saying is you used to
love this guy, so maybe --

04:29.636 --> 04:31.004
Hey! You represented
George Vogelman.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.039
I wasn't in love with him!
You were close friends.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.909
And my objectivity wasn't
compromised a bit, was it?

04:35.942 --> 04:38.378
The man cut off heads,
stabbed co-workers,

04:38.411 --> 04:39.580
and I didn't have a clue!

04:39.613 --> 04:43.449
My objectivity
on this is fine.

04:43.483 --> 04:44.751
Fine.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.486
Fine.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.856
I know it sounds crazy,

04:49.890 --> 04:52.726
but first we started fighting
over the smell.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.927
Of the cigars?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.929
Yes. It would get
into the fabric

04:55.962 --> 04:57.764
of the sofa, the drapes.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.766
The house would reek.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.034
Then there was the health.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.603
I'd start talking
about how I was afraid

05:02.636 --> 05:04.437
that he was going
to get mouth cancer,

05:04.470 --> 05:07.708
and it would escalate
into a bigger argument.

05:07.741 --> 05:11.077
Then, in order to get out
of the house, or away from me,

05:11.111 --> 05:13.647
he started going
to these cigar clubs,

05:13.680 --> 05:16.049
spending money
we didn't have.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.585
He started spending
more and more time there.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.754
Our relationship
continued to deteriorate.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.355
Did you ever
go for counseling?

05:22.388 --> 05:26.392
Yes. The therapist said
his cigar smoking was an issue

05:26.426 --> 05:29.530
and that he should stop,
but he couldn't.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.064
He was addicted.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.634
Are you serious?

05:33.667 --> 05:34.768
If I establish
addiction --

05:34.801 --> 05:35.736
You won't.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.403
A trial will cost you
a lot more than just --

05:37.437 --> 05:39.906
I expected her to say
something half-credible.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.875
Once again, if we survive
summary judgment,
then my client --

05:41.908 --> 05:44.044
There is no chance I'm going
to recommend to my client

05:44.077 --> 05:45.646
that they pay anything on this.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.148
If you proceed, you can be sure
I'll be bringing a motion

05:48.181 --> 05:50.617
against your client for costs,
attorneys' fees --

05:50.651 --> 05:51.552
You can't win that,

05:51.585 --> 05:53.887
and even if you could,
she's judgment-proof.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.589
Just make an offer.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.057
BOBBY: Nothing?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.526
I still think
I can get something.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.928
I'm deposing a senior
management executive
at Williams Breyland.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.630
If I can shake him up,
I should be able
to get nuisance.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.699
Cigarette companies
don't pay nuisance.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.400
There's no way
a cigar company is --

06:07.433 --> 06:08.735
You don't know that.
The precedent alone --

06:08.769 --> 06:10.637
Jimmy, this case
doesn't involve you.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.573
BOBBY: All right,
depose the executive.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.107
If you still
get nowhere --

06:14.140 --> 06:14.975
Thank you.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.177
Actually, I would like
a second chair --

06:17.210 --> 06:19.179
a showing that the whole firm
is behind the case.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.581
It'll help me
settle it faster.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.983
I've got a status conference
on Michaels.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.853
You just said
it didn't involve me.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.155
One depo, Jimmy.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.724
You just have to sit there
like a big lump.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.092
You think
you can do that?

06:32.125 --> 06:33.093
She's hostile.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.061
One deposition.
You can do it.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.433
(traffic sound)

06:40.466 --> 06:42.936
MR. KOUFO: He came in the
store. He was about 17.

06:42.969 --> 06:43.637
HELEN: The victim?

06:43.670 --> 06:46.106
Yes.
I had my back to him.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.941
When he got closer
to the counter,

06:47.974 --> 06:49.175
I turned toward him.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.178
That's when he came in
yelling, "Freeze!"

06:52.212 --> 06:53.814
HELEN: The defendant?
MR. KOUFO: Yes.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.549
What happened next?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.818
Well, I thought something
must be going down.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.621
I started reaching under
the counter for my rifle

07:00.654 --> 07:02.756
because I thought
I was about to be robbed.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.726
Then the officer
just opened fire.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.493
Mr. Koufo,
did you know

07:07.528 --> 07:09.596
Mr. Armstrong
was a police officer

07:09.630 --> 07:10.764
when he came in the store?

07:10.797 --> 07:12.599
No.
He was not uniformed.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.736
Did he ever identify himself
as a police officer?

07:15.769 --> 07:16.737
No.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.572
Could you tell the court,

07:18.605 --> 07:20.574
did Will Bradley
ever make a move

07:20.607 --> 07:22.175
toward you or the defendant

07:22.208 --> 07:24.044
before the defendant
opened fire?

07:24.077 --> 07:27.013
No. He just came in,
the officer yelled,
"Freeze!"

07:27.047 --> 07:28.481
Shot the boy three times.

07:28.515 --> 07:31.117
Did you ever see a gun
in Mr. Bradley's hands?

07:31.151 --> 07:32.018
No.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.621
HELEN: Now, as Mr. Armstrong
was shooting,

07:34.655 --> 07:37.991
could you see whether or not
Mr. Bradley was holding a gun?

07:38.024 --> 07:39.993
I could see
that he wasn't.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.828
Thank you.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.001
You said you went looking
for your rifle

07:48.034 --> 07:50.203
once officer Armstrong
came in.

07:50.236 --> 07:51.538
Was that your testimony?

07:51.572 --> 07:52.773
Yes.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.208
So, your eyes -- they weren't
on Will Bradley at this moment?

07:55.241 --> 07:56.877
I was looking
back and forth.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.646
Back and forth.
So, for part of this time

07:59.680 --> 08:01.915
your eyes were not
on Will Bradley, right?

08:01.948 --> 08:03.316
Yes.

08:03.349 --> 08:06.219
REBECCA: So if he made a sudden
movement in Mr. Armstrong's
direction,

08:06.252 --> 08:09.089
it's possible you might not
have seen that, true?

08:09.122 --> 08:11.191
I guess it's possible.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.561
And by the way, Will Bradley was
carrying a gun on his person

08:14.595 --> 08:16.062
at the time
of the shooting, right?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.798
I didn't see it.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.667
I was informed later
he was carrying a gun.

08:21.034 --> 08:25.872
(music playing)

08:33.145 --> 08:36.517
(people chattering)

08:46.727 --> 08:49.730
Well, in my professional
opinion, we're dead.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.964
Why?

08:50.997 --> 08:53.033
Until now,
we always thought

08:53.066 --> 08:54.334
the store owner
reached for his gun

08:54.367 --> 08:56.002
because he thought the kid
was going to rob him.

08:56.036 --> 08:56.837
That's what he said.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.039
No, he said
he reached for his gun

08:59.072 --> 09:00.741
because you came in
yelling "Freeze!"

09:00.774 --> 09:02.943
Making him think
the robbery was going down.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.611
Craig, try to get this.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.780
Don't talk to me like
I'm some ghetto banger, Ellenor.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.114
I'm a police officer.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.251
We always thought the owner
would corroborate
your suspicion

09:11.284 --> 09:12.252
that a crime was in play,

09:12.285 --> 09:14.621
but he only thought that
based on your behavior,

09:14.655 --> 09:16.256
not that of the victim's,

09:16.289 --> 09:19.159
so basically, we have nothing
to validate your suspicion.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.061
I've got nine years
on the force

09:21.094 --> 09:22.863
to validate my suspicion.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.164
I know that element.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.299
I saw it in the store,
and if I hadn't shot him,

09:26.332 --> 09:28.301
he would've robbed the place.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.704
What was he doing with a gun,
Ellenor?

09:31.772 --> 09:32.706
The problem is,

09:32.739 --> 09:34.775
the gun was not in sight
when you opened fire.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.777
The problem is, the gun
was not in his hand.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.178
Who the hell are you,
the D. A.?

09:39.012 --> 09:40.647
No. I am your lawyer

09:40.681 --> 09:43.684
trying to make you understand
the severity of these facts.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.252
And once again, I recommend
that you consider taking --

09:46.286 --> 09:48.188
I am not pleading out!
I'm not going to jail!

09:48.221 --> 09:49.590
All right, Craig.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.794
The kid was scum.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.329
The store owner might be dead
if I hadn't got there.

09:56.362 --> 09:59.866
I'm not taking a deal
that puts me in prison.

10:00.701 --> 10:04.871
(music playing)

10:10.844 --> 10:13.780
We're deposing an executive
from Williams later today.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.248
After that,
we'll see where we are.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.350
I felt like
the biggest fool.

10:17.383 --> 10:18.885
You're not a fool.

10:18.919 --> 10:23.356
I swear to you, Lindsay,
I saw Ed.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.191
I watched
how he got sucked in.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.194
The magazines,
the clubs.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.963
He got sucked
into that world.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.732
He became an addict.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.333
He-he spent money
we didn't have,

10:33.366 --> 10:35.001
and it cost us.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.971
I am not crazy.
I watched it happen.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.682
Look, after
tomorrow's deposition,

10:48.715 --> 10:50.350
we might have to
just cut our losses.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.118
I have a duty to my partners.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.722
You think I'd be able
to sue him.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.458
Well, it's a no-fault state.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.126
I watched it happen.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.062
I am not crazy.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.865
Those cigars helped
kill our marriage.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.901
(sighs)

11:13.173 --> 11:15.909
You seem to have
the same temper I remember.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.411
I didn't shoot because
I lost my temper, Bec.

11:18.444 --> 11:20.346
I'm talking about
you and Ellenor.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.716
Yeah, well, it seems like
she thinks I'm guilty.

11:23.149 --> 11:26.119
No. She thinks you have
a tough case, which you do.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.054
If I hadn't shot that kid,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.790
he would've been killed
by one of his homies

11:29.823 --> 11:31.191
a week later.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.759
He was a perp.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.127
Juvie record
as long as my arm.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.996
You know that neighborhood
as well as I do.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.364
You take that attitude
on the stand,

11:38.398 --> 11:39.399
you're going down.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.768
Craig,
are you listening to me?

11:43.469 --> 11:45.906
I'm just frustrated.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.173
I understand.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.377
But you need to listen to us
and do what we tell you to.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.446
Giving me orders again.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.516
Just like old times.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.983
Hey, you came to me.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.785
Yes, I did, because...

12:00.921 --> 12:02.789
I hear you guys are good.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.859
So, listen to us.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.428
Okay.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.032
You need to keep
an even keel up there.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.266
Matter-of-fact.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.035
Don't get defensive.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.171
People who know
they're innocent
don't get defensive.

12:18.204 --> 12:21.174
Now, the D. A.,
she's gonna push.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.544
She's gonna try
to get you to reveal rage

12:23.577 --> 12:25.111
and a temper.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.981
You don't let that happen,
Craig.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.020
Okay.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.457
You do publish
this magazine?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.492
Yes, and other
cigar manufacturers
also publish similar --

12:39.526 --> 12:41.828
Williams and Breyland
publishes this one?

12:41.862 --> 12:42.495
That's correct.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.364
And one goal
of this magazine

12:44.397 --> 12:46.933
would be to
perhaps induce men
to smoke cigars.

12:46.967 --> 12:52.105
It's actually designed
more for the cigar lover,
men who already smoke.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.208
Is it your testimony
that there is no intent
to attract new customers?

12:55.241 --> 12:57.343
No. Certainly
we like to expand
our customer base.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.345
The magazine promotes
the smoking of cigars,

12:59.379 --> 13:00.080
can we say that?

13:00.113 --> 13:03.083
Yes, but we
do not encourage men

13:03.116 --> 13:05.251
to leave their wives
in order to do so.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.120
Thank you.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.421
But you probably
would be aware

13:08.454 --> 13:11.825
that cigar-smoking,
the smell of a cigar --

13:11.858 --> 13:13.527
it is an issue with
some husbands and wives.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.361
Not an issue
to threaten a marriage.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.462
But an issue.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.098
Could be.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.234
These cigar clubs,
primarily for men --

13:21.267 --> 13:21.935
would that be
a fair statement?

13:21.968 --> 13:23.970
Yes, but women
aren't excluded.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.606
What percentage
of these clubs' members

13:25.639 --> 13:27.073
are men, on average?

13:27.107 --> 13:28.141
STEWART: I do not know.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.843
LINDSAY: Would it surprise you
to learn over 95%?

13:29.876 --> 13:31.912
Cigars are primarily
smoked by men.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.046
We've established that.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.115
You're aware cigars
may be addictive?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.618
There's no scientific evidence
to conclude that they are.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.986
Is it your testimony
cigars are not addictive?

13:40.020 --> 13:44.424
My testimony is that there
is no scientific evidence
to confirm it.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.293
You're aware cigar smokers
have an increased risk
of oral cancer.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.829
Yes.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.364
You're aware cigar smokers
are at an increased risk
of esophageal cancer.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.498
Objection.
This is not a cancer --

13:52.533 --> 13:53.967
This is just a deposition.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.301
All objections are waived
till trial,

13:55.335 --> 13:56.870
except to form
of the question.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.606
LINDSAY: Esophageal cancer?

14:01.141 --> 14:03.276
Most smokers
do not inhale, so --

14:03.309 --> 14:05.311
Is it your testimony,
a smoker who doesn't inhale

14:05.345 --> 14:07.447
does not have a higher risk
of esophageal cancer

14:07.480 --> 14:08.181
than a non-smoker?

14:08.214 --> 14:10.316
That would not be
my testimony.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.118
You're aware
of an increased risk.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.487
I'm aware
of the possibility, yes.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.624
LINDSAY: And are you aware,
even for cigar smokers
who do not inhale,

14:17.658 --> 14:20.460
their risk for larynx cancer
is more than 10 times greater

14:20.493 --> 14:21.895
than it is for non-smokers?

14:21.928 --> 14:24.230
I'm aware of
that medical claim,

14:24.264 --> 14:27.534
however, I have no basis
on which to either agree
or disagree with it.

14:27.568 --> 14:29.402
Okay.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.606
Let's turn
to heart disease.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.141
That had nothing to do
with anything.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.309
I know what I'm doing,
Jimmy.

14:36.342 --> 14:39.312
All I'm saying,
this isn't a cancer case.

14:39.345 --> 14:40.514
LINDSAY: I have my reasons.
BOBBY: Hold on.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.583
JIMMY: The guy left his wife.
She blames it on a cigar.

14:42.616 --> 14:45.085
We take the case,
and she's in there
talking about cancer.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.152
All right.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.121
Now she's
deposing the husband,
did you know that?

14:48.154 --> 14:49.990
This has turned
into 3 depositions,

14:50.023 --> 14:51.457
plus a motion
for summary judgment.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.626
JIMMY: We've got
two lawyers on it --

14:52.659 --> 14:54.127
What the hell
is your problem?

14:54.160 --> 14:54.995
I'm just saying --

14:55.028 --> 14:56.362
You've said enough.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.667
(door slams)

15:01.968 --> 15:04.104
Is there something
I'm not getting here?

15:04.137 --> 15:06.339
It's Lindsay
who's not gettin' it...

15:06.372 --> 15:07.240
from Bobby.

15:07.741 --> 15:08.609
Lucy!

15:15.582 --> 15:17.518
I have a plan, okay?

15:18.118 --> 15:19.452
It's not just about --

15:19.485 --> 15:22.055
these people
don't wanna go to trial.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.924
I have a plan.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.259
(sighs)

15:27.027 --> 15:29.329
I was walking a few doors
down from the store.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.731
It's on my way home.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.599
I saw the young man,
Mr. Bradley,

15:32.633 --> 15:33.634
approaching the store.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.002
I saw that he had something
metal in his hand

15:36.036 --> 15:37.704
that was reflecting
in the sunlight.

15:37.738 --> 15:39.172
As he went into the store,

15:39.205 --> 15:40.473
I hustled up
to get a better look.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.075
And did you
get a better look?

15:42.108 --> 15:43.710
CRAIG: Yes.
When I got to the door,

15:43.744 --> 15:46.012
I could see that the suspect
was approaching the counter.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.148
He was then reaching
into his coat.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.216
It looked to me like he
was reaching for a weapon.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.685
REBECCA: What did you do then?

15:51.718 --> 15:52.553
CRAIG: I went into the store

15:52.586 --> 15:54.521
and ordered him
to drop his weapon.

15:54.555 --> 15:56.089
He turned towards me.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.091
His arm was
still inside his coat,

15:58.124 --> 16:00.160
and I saw
what looked like a gun.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.663
I thought he was
pulling it out on me,
so I shot.

16:02.696 --> 16:05.131
REBECCA: How many times
did you shoot?

16:05.165 --> 16:07.568
I later found out
it was three times.

16:07.601 --> 16:10.436
What was the first thought
that came to your mind

16:10.470 --> 16:11.572
when you saw this gun?

16:11.605 --> 16:14.040
That he was
about to shoot me.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.742
I thought my life
was in danger,

16:15.776 --> 16:18.011
and I reacted.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.146
You were off duty,
and you had a gun.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.014
Yes.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.048
HELEN: Why was that?

16:22.082 --> 16:23.684
I carry it
for personal protection.

16:23.717 --> 16:27.320
Oh. You said you were
suspicious of Mr. Bradley

16:27.353 --> 16:29.723
before he came into the store.
Why is that?

16:29.756 --> 16:32.425
Like I said,
I saw something metal
in his hand.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.394
But because of the angle
of the sun,

16:34.427 --> 16:35.428
you weren't sure
what it was.

16:35.461 --> 16:36.763
That's correct.

16:37.598 --> 16:39.299
What was it
about this young man

16:39.332 --> 16:41.334
that made you
immediately think
that he had a gun

16:41.367 --> 16:42.435
and not something else?

16:42.468 --> 16:44.470
I just had a feeling
is all.

16:44.505 --> 16:47.073
Mr. Armstrong,
did that feeling
have anything to do

16:47.107 --> 16:48.709
with the color
of Mr. Bradley's skin?

16:48.742 --> 16:50.476
That's ridiculous.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.278
Have you ever heard the term
"Racial profiling"?

16:52.312 --> 16:53.046
CRAIG: Yes.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.380
HELEN: Could you explain
it to us?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.582
It's making assumptions

16:55.616 --> 16:57.684
about whether or not
someone is a suspect

16:57.718 --> 16:59.085
based on their race.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.721
Have you ever used
racial profiling

17:00.754 --> 17:02.689
in your position
as a police officer?

17:02.723 --> 17:05.458
If you look closely,
you'll see that I'm black.

17:05.491 --> 17:08.328
Thank you. Have you ever
made derogatory statements

17:08.361 --> 17:10.096
about any ethnic
or racial group?

17:10.130 --> 17:11.231
No.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.366
HELEN: Not even your own?
No.

17:13.398 --> 17:15.101
Is that the truth,
Mr. Armstrong?

17:15.135 --> 17:16.837
Yes, it is.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.971
Your honor, at this time,

17:18.003 --> 17:20.473
the commonwealth
would like to call
a rebuttal witness.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.176
Hilary Pope.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.444
She's an ex-girlfriend.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.280
We lived together
till about 3 years ago.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.414
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.083
Well, we speak
every once in a while.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.084
We split on okay terms.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.119
Well, Craig, she must
have something to say.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.287
Did you talk to her
about the shooting?

17:34.320 --> 17:37.190
Yes, but I told her
the same thing
I told everybody else.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.124
I told her what happened.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.260
And you never said,
"God, what have I done,"

17:40.293 --> 17:41.361
or "I've made
a big mistake"?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.229
I was upset about it.
I told her that.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.098
But I didn't admit
to being wrong or anything.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.200
All right. What about
this racial-profiling issue?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.602
Did you ever talk to her
about that?

17:48.635 --> 17:49.536
No.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.306
What's going on,
Rebecca?

17:53.339 --> 17:54.641
What are they doing?

17:55.676 --> 17:56.610
I don't know.

17:59.613 --> 18:01.481
But we'll find out
soon enough.

18:01.515 --> 18:06.653
(music playing)

18:15.829 --> 18:17.664
You ready?
It's a quarter to 8:00.

18:17.698 --> 18:19.132
I'm ready.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.670
I'm sorry this has
been so much trouble.

18:23.704 --> 18:25.572
I-I-I never --
It's just --

18:25.606 --> 18:27.674
She's a friend,
and you need sex.

18:27.708 --> 18:28.709
Please don't
make fun of me.

18:30.677 --> 18:34.515
This case, is it pushing
a button that I-I can't see?

18:34.548 --> 18:36.116
Maybe.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.218
I think when a couple
splits up,

18:38.251 --> 18:40.453
I-I feel threatened by it --

18:40.486 --> 18:41.688
that marriage doesn't work.

18:41.722 --> 18:43.557
Well,
if your friend's marriage

18:43.590 --> 18:46.693
was truly broken up
by...a cigar,

18:46.727 --> 18:50.196
I-I wouldn't point to it
as an example
of the institution.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.765
They had a really
strong marriage, Bobby,

18:51.798 --> 18:53.333
for so long.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.735
And then...poof.

18:54.768 --> 18:56.169
He lit up?

18:56.202 --> 18:57.571
Yes.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.471
And she had a baby.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.740
She couldn't
drop the weight.

18:59.773 --> 19:01.474
She got a little fat,
and...

19:01.508 --> 19:02.843
he switched to a cigar.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.578
Will that be your argument
in court?

19:04.611 --> 19:06.379
No.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.183
I still want
to make love to you.

19:10.617 --> 19:14.721
And I am not
going to switch to a cigar.

19:14.755 --> 19:17.891
If the passion is eroding
even before we walk
down the aisle --

19:17.924 --> 19:21.327
My passion isn't eroding.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.297
Promise?

19:24.330 --> 19:25.932
Promise.

19:34.775 --> 19:37.410
My parents had
a perfect marriage...

19:37.443 --> 19:39.613
right up until the moment
my father left.

19:41.582 --> 19:43.383
Their marriage
wasn't perfect, Lindsay.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.485
They were just
sheltering you from it,
you know that.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.387
(sighs)

19:47.420 --> 19:49.355
I think
I'm anxious to blame...

19:49.389 --> 19:52.593
those cigars myself
on this case,

19:52.626 --> 19:53.694
because I don't
want to believe

19:53.727 --> 19:56.597
that people
just stop loving each other.

19:56.630 --> 20:02.235
(music playing)

20:05.038 --> 20:07.240
(traffic sound)

20:07.273 --> 20:08.509
HILLARY: We lived together
for two years,

20:08.542 --> 20:10.511
from 1994-1996.

20:10.544 --> 20:13.013
HELEN: Miss Pope, during the
course of your relationship,

20:13.046 --> 20:14.748
did the defendant
ever express

20:14.781 --> 20:17.518
any feelings about
African-Americans?

20:17.551 --> 20:18.852
Sometimes.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.387
He'd use derogatory names.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.255
The "n" word.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.957
All right, occasionally,

20:23.990 --> 20:25.992
people will use
derogatory terms

20:26.026 --> 20:28.795
about people of their own race
affectionately

20:28.829 --> 20:29.830
and not maliciously.

20:29.863 --> 20:32.633
HELEN: Are you sure that wasn't
what was going on?

20:32.666 --> 20:34.835
No. I know what
you're talking about.

20:34.868 --> 20:37.037
When Craig Armstrong
calls someone a "Nigger,"

20:37.070 --> 20:39.272
he means it
in the way the word
was originally intended.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.841
Objection.
Foundation.

20:40.874 --> 20:42.509
Her foundation is
she lived with him.

20:42.543 --> 20:44.611
It's also inflammatory
and prejudicial...

20:44.645 --> 20:46.412
HELEN: She is more than
competent to give testimony

20:46.446 --> 20:47.881
as to the defendant's
state of mind.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.383
All right,
I'm allowing the testimony.

20:50.416 --> 20:53.419
JUDGE PATRICK: Ms. Washington,
you're free to cross-examine.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.555
Please sit.

20:57.057 --> 20:59.292
When your ex-boyfriend
spoke this way,

20:59.325 --> 21:00.761
was there a context?

21:00.794 --> 21:04.330
He was usually unwinding
at the end of the day.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.967
He'd talk about all
the "shiftless niggers"
he had to roust

21:07.000 --> 21:09.836
or the "welfare Jemimas"
with their "litters of kids."

21:09.870 --> 21:11.972
He called them "litters"
like dogs.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.574
That's a lie!

21:13.607 --> 21:15.909
Officer Armstrong,
sit down!

21:16.476 --> 21:18.011
(crowd murmuring)

21:18.044 --> 21:20.647
HELEN: Did officer Armstrong,
to your knowledge,

21:20.681 --> 21:22.883
ever make these kind
of derogatory remarks

21:22.916 --> 21:23.984
about white people?

21:24.017 --> 21:26.352
No, he did not.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.923
REBECCA: So, when Mr. Armstrong
made these comments
you said he made,

21:29.956 --> 21:30.824
how did you respond to them?

21:30.857 --> 21:32.458
I didn't say anything.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.895
You never said anything?

21:34.928 --> 21:37.598
You didn't say, "Please
don't use those ugly words

21:37.631 --> 21:38.665
when referring
to black people"?

21:38.699 --> 21:39.966
No.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.067
REBECCA: So, for two years,

21:41.101 --> 21:44.370
you lived with Mr. Armstrong
making derogatory comments

21:44.404 --> 21:45.672
about African-Americans,

21:45.706 --> 21:47.473
and you never said anything.

21:47.508 --> 21:49.042
REBECCA: If his comments
were so offensive,

21:49.075 --> 21:50.343
why did you stay with him?

21:50.376 --> 21:51.778
He wasn't abusive to me,

21:51.812 --> 21:53.146
and eventually
I did leave him.

21:53.179 --> 21:57.518
REBECCA: Did you report any of
this to officer Armstrong's
superiors?

21:57.551 --> 21:58.218
HILLARY: No.

21:58.251 --> 21:59.653
But we should
believe you now?

21:59.686 --> 22:01.454
I'm telling the truth.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.024
Or maybe you saw
your ex-boyfriend on TV

22:04.057 --> 22:06.359
and thought you could
really stick it to him
one last time.

22:06.392 --> 22:08.729
Objection.
JUDGE PATRICK: Sustained.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.764
Did the police come to you,
or did you go to them?

22:10.797 --> 22:13.499
I went to them.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.070
Why?

22:19.506 --> 22:21.675
Because I think Craig
might be quick
to pull the trigger

22:21.708 --> 22:24.845
on a black person
he happened on
in a convenience store.

22:24.878 --> 22:28.749
(music playing)

22:29.883 --> 22:30.917
I specifically asked,

22:30.951 --> 22:33.386
did she have anything to say
on the racial profiling?

22:33.419 --> 22:35.055
I never said the stuff
she said I did.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.022
Why would she lie?

22:36.056 --> 22:37.023
I don't know.

22:37.057 --> 22:38.391
Maybe that's the way
she heard it,

22:38.424 --> 22:40.160
but I never said it
like that.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.028
Did you call black women
"Jemimas"

22:42.062 --> 22:43.630
and their children
"litters of kids"?

22:43.664 --> 22:44.798
It wasn't like that.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.132
Well, how was it like?

22:48.602 --> 22:49.736
How was it like?

22:49.770 --> 22:50.504
CRAIG: Come on.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.138
You're
a defense attorney, Rebecca.

22:52.172 --> 22:53.707
We deal with the same scum.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.009
I do not think of
human beings as scum,

22:56.042 --> 22:57.077
and if you do --

22:57.110 --> 22:58.745
Hey,
you ever been out there?

22:58.779 --> 22:59.713
It's a tough job.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.882
CRAIG: After a while,
it's hard to sympathize

23:01.915 --> 23:03.684
with people
who are smoking crack

23:03.717 --> 23:05.919
or boosting VCRs
or shooting children.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.287
Sympathize
with black people.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.423
You're gonna tell me
when you see a news teaser
for some awful crime,

23:10.456 --> 23:12.993
you don't say a silent prayer
that it's not one of us?

23:13.026 --> 23:14.995
And when you see that it is,
Rebecca,

23:15.028 --> 23:17.497
do you sympathize,
or are you disgusted?

23:17.531 --> 23:19.099
Neither.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.503
I'm in pain.
It hurts.

23:22.536 --> 23:25.572
Look, it's these criminals
that make us look bad,

23:25.606 --> 23:28.008
and that's why I sometimes
blow off steam

23:28.041 --> 23:30.711
in the privacy
of my own home.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.646
Make us look bad to who?
To white folks?

23:32.679 --> 23:33.947
All folks.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.481
Look, if you want
to be lumped in

23:35.516 --> 23:37.584
with those animals out there,
that's fine --

23:37.618 --> 23:38.952
Animals?
CRAIG: Yes.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.787
Some people act like animals,

23:40.821 --> 23:43.489
and they deserve
the same amount of respect.

23:43.524 --> 23:45.759
That's all I was
saying to Hillary.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.460
Nothing more.

23:47.493 --> 23:49.763
Did you take one look
at Will Bradley

23:49.796 --> 23:51.164
and think he was
one of those animals?

23:51.197 --> 23:54.000
It was a clean shoot,
Rebecca.

23:54.034 --> 23:56.803
Do you hear yourself?

23:58.972 --> 24:00.807
I don't know
who you are anymore.

24:00.841 --> 24:03.744
I am somebody who wanted
to get out of the neighborhood

24:03.777 --> 24:05.946
just as bad as you.

24:05.979 --> 24:07.914
Look at you.

24:07.948 --> 24:09.783
You're a lawyer.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.752
You made it.

24:13.053 --> 24:14.721
Well, so did I.

24:15.656 --> 24:16.857
Yeah.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.662
And you returned
one of those white cops
we grew up with.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.201
All right, look...

24:29.770 --> 24:31.905
if we can still
plead this out,

24:31.938 --> 24:33.640
you have to let us try.

24:33.674 --> 24:37.644
(music playing)

24:41.147 --> 24:44.084
I would hardly
consider a cigar
the doom of my marriage.

24:44.117 --> 24:46.086
Can you tell us what was?

24:46.119 --> 24:48.722
Mainly we stopped
communicating.

24:48.755 --> 24:51.625
It may sound
like the old clichÃ©,
but we drifted apart.

24:51.658 --> 24:52.859
Eventually,
the estrangement

24:52.893 --> 24:55.696
left us both feeling
rather...isolated.

24:55.729 --> 24:58.164
And then...
ATTORNEY: Then what?

24:58.999 --> 25:01.001
Then I met somebody else.

25:01.034 --> 25:01.935
I fell in love.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.304
And it was after you met
this other woman...

25:04.337 --> 25:06.707
We filed for divorce
shortly after.

25:06.740 --> 25:09.209
LINDSAY(sighs): At some point
during your estrangement,

25:09.242 --> 25:11.211
you began smoking cigars.

25:11.244 --> 25:13.079
Yes, but that --
Thank you.

25:13.346 --> 25:14.748
Are you addicted
to them?

25:14.781 --> 25:15.916
PINKNER: Probably.

25:15.949 --> 25:16.983
LINDSAY: How many
do you smoke a day?

25:17.017 --> 25:18.819
Six or seven.

25:18.852 --> 25:20.987
How's your professional
life at the moment?

25:21.755 --> 25:22.756
Is that what
you're telling them?

25:22.789 --> 25:24.224
I didn't tell her anything.

25:24.257 --> 25:25.992
Please direct
your responses to me.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.295
How's your
professional life?

25:29.996 --> 25:31.665
It's not good.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.801
I was laid off
as a senior accountant
eleven months ago.

25:34.835 --> 25:36.236
Now I'm employed
as a junior accountant.

25:36.937 --> 25:38.872
Less money?
Yes.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.974
Mr. Pinkner,
according to your wife,

25:41.007 --> 25:44.110
when you would argue
over your smoking cigars,

25:44.144 --> 25:46.079
you would say you like
the way they make you feel.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.081
LINDSAY: Could you explain that?

25:48.114 --> 25:51.952
Well,
a cigar means success.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.921
They're expensive.
They stand for victory.

25:55.288 --> 25:56.790
You look at these magazines.

25:56.823 --> 25:57.924
"Success."

25:58.725 --> 26:00.561
You said something
about flicking an ash.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.328
PINKNER: Oh, yeah.

26:02.362 --> 26:03.029
When I flick an ash,

26:03.063 --> 26:06.900
it's like I dust off
a problem.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.302
It makes me powerful.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.306
The more expensive the cigar,
the more important I am.

26:13.774 --> 26:15.776
Why the cigar clubs,
Mr. Pinkner?

26:15.809 --> 26:17.878
PINKNER: I don't know.

26:17.911 --> 26:21.081
The exclusivity of it
makes you feel like somebody.

26:21.748 --> 26:25.586
Sitting...
talking with men...

26:26.887 --> 26:28.088
I liked it.

26:29.690 --> 26:31.091
I'm still so confused.

26:31.124 --> 26:32.759
Where are you going
with all this?

26:32.793 --> 26:35.028
One more meeting.
I just need to do
a little research.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.663
Bobby, hi.

26:36.697 --> 26:38.164
If I could get you
to sit in,
that'd be great.

26:38.198 --> 26:39.733
Show of strength.
The meeting is at 3:00.

26:39.766 --> 26:40.834
Uh, you won't
have to do anything.

26:40.867 --> 26:41.668
Just back me up
when necessary.

26:41.702 --> 26:43.837
I'll be back
in an hour and a half.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.772
Lucy, could you straighten
out the conference room?

26:46.773 --> 26:48.775
Do you know where
she's headed with this?

26:48.809 --> 26:52.245
Not really,
but I guess we'll find out.

26:55.248 --> 26:57.951
ELLENOR: Come on. You put
reckless on the table, Helen.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.219
HELEN: That was before
you made me try it.

26:59.252 --> 27:00.320
I'm not pleading out now.

27:00.353 --> 27:02.355
Look, you know at worst,
this guy was overzealous.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.223
He is certainly --

27:03.256 --> 27:04.958
Look, Ellenor,
I put the offer out there.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.060
You said no.
You can't have it both ways.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.929
We have grounds on
unfair surprise anyway.

27:08.962 --> 27:10.230
Why don't you just
bank your conviction?

27:10.263 --> 27:12.365
Sorry.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.134
You've been hanging around
Richard Bay too long.

27:14.167 --> 27:15.902
Ouch.

27:17.871 --> 27:20.206
Well...you got
any ideas, Rebecca?

27:25.278 --> 27:26.680
His juvie record.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.148
Excuse me?
The victim.

27:28.181 --> 27:30.283
Craig said he had
a long juvie record.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.918
It shouldn't be
sealed anymore.

27:31.952 --> 27:33.253
Does a seal survive death?

27:33.286 --> 27:34.788
I don't think so.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.022
Let's go get 'em.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.692
You wanna put
the victim on trial?

27:38.725 --> 27:40.426
We just want
to introduce his priors.

27:40.460 --> 27:41.394
Why?

27:41.427 --> 27:43.263
Our client made
a judgment call,
your honor.

27:43.296 --> 27:46.199
A judgment based on
nine years of experience
in the field.

27:46.232 --> 27:49.269
Mr. Bradley has
a pretty extensive
juvenile criminal record,

27:49.302 --> 27:51.104
including being a suspect
in a murder --

27:51.137 --> 27:52.372
What are you saying?

27:52.405 --> 27:54.708
That your client knows
one when he sees one?

27:54.741 --> 27:56.076
Well,
in essence, yes.

27:56.109 --> 27:57.310
Oh, please, shoot away.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.445
The kid was
a suspected murderer.

27:59.479 --> 28:01.347
The jury should be allowed
to hear that.

28:01.381 --> 28:03.049
HELEN: You know, this is
absolutely ridiculous.

28:03.083 --> 28:04.284
The only relevancy

28:04.317 --> 28:06.119
goes to the defendant's
state of mind,

28:06.152 --> 28:08.755
and he did not know the victim
was a murder suspect

28:08.789 --> 28:09.656
when he opened fire.

28:09.690 --> 28:12.458
He had opportunity
to observe his demeanor.

28:12.492 --> 28:14.127
Nice try, but forget it.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.829
The victim's priors
do not come in.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.497
Your honor --
No chance.

28:17.531 --> 28:19.065
Any more witnesses?

28:20.500 --> 28:21.735
No.

28:21.768 --> 28:24.871
Closing arguments, 3:30.

28:27.841 --> 28:28.909
So now what?

28:28.942 --> 28:30.877
We argue the elements.

28:30.911 --> 28:31.712
You still have a shot.

28:31.745 --> 28:33.446
If the jury believed you,
you're home.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.248
Oh, this kid was bad.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.217
He had two
aggravated assaults,

28:37.250 --> 28:39.886
and a murder charge
got kicked because
of a bad search.

28:39.920 --> 28:43.489
Oh, my God. I knew the man
this kid killed.

28:43.524 --> 28:45.058
Craig, it was Gavin Page.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.126
Remember?
He lived on our street.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.761
He was this tall guy --

28:54.500 --> 28:55.969
What?

28:56.002 --> 28:58.839
You were close
with Gavin Page.

29:00.340 --> 29:02.242
When was the last time
you saw him?

29:09.415 --> 29:11.151
Oh, my God.

29:12.285 --> 29:14.087
Oh, my God, what?

29:15.055 --> 29:17.524
This shooting wasn't
a mistake, was it, Craig?

29:18.592 --> 29:21.394
REBECCA: This Bradley kid
shot your friend,

29:21.427 --> 29:24.397
got kicked
because of a bad search.

29:25.165 --> 29:26.199
You executed him.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.168
Clean shoot.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.803
You're a murderer.

29:31.371 --> 29:32.773
Clean shoot.

29:34.274 --> 29:36.910
The reason the store owner
saw no gun --

29:36.943 --> 29:38.478
he had no gun.

29:38.512 --> 29:41.915
You planted it on him
after the kid went down.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.088
Clean shoot.

29:49.122 --> 29:53.026
(music playing)

30:03.236 --> 30:04.938
I grew up with the man.

30:06.640 --> 30:08.909
(scoffs)
I loved him, even.

30:08.942 --> 30:11.845
Rebecca, you hadn't seen him
for over ten years.

30:11.878 --> 30:16.282
But when you know somebody,
you know somebody.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.618
I-I can't believe --

30:17.651 --> 30:20.453
We just put our best faces on,
and we do the job.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.223
That's what they taught us
in law school, remember?

30:23.256 --> 30:24.891
Legal ethics class --
We just --

30:24.925 --> 30:26.860
I'm not sure I can close.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.863
(Ellenor sighs)

30:31.431 --> 30:34.234
Look, if you feel
you're gonna be
too emotional about it,

30:34.267 --> 30:36.169
I suppose I can do it,
but...

30:37.270 --> 30:39.005
it should probably be you.

30:39.039 --> 30:40.240
Why?

30:40.541 --> 30:41.608
Because you're black.

30:42.576 --> 30:44.511
And in the wake of
this racial-profiling thing,

30:44.545 --> 30:47.113
we need a black attorney
to stand up there and close.

30:47.147 --> 30:50.016
It'll help, Rebecca.
Let's not kid ourselves.

30:51.384 --> 30:54.154
Our best chance
at acquittal is you.

30:55.589 --> 30:58.191
That's what we're supposed
to be going for, right?

30:59.059 --> 31:00.493
An acquittal?

31:06.166 --> 31:10.436
STEWART: Now, I have already
given you way more time
than this case deserves,

31:10.470 --> 31:11.572
and I'm at the point
of instructing counsel

31:11.605 --> 31:13.974
to bring an action against you
for abuse of process.

31:14.007 --> 31:15.241
That's not going to happen,
Mr. Stewart.

31:15.275 --> 31:17.678
(scoffs)
Do you really think

31:17.711 --> 31:19.913
I'm gonna pay
your client money?

31:19.946 --> 31:22.616
A broken marriage
because her husband
smoked cigars?

31:22.649 --> 31:24.985
Do I look like the idiot
of the new millennium
to you?

31:25.018 --> 31:27.353
No. I see symptoms
of intelligence,

31:27.387 --> 31:29.523
and that's why
you will settle this case.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.494
You might think we have
a lousy claim, Mr. Stewart,

31:34.528 --> 31:37.297
but we'll survive
summary judgment,
and here's why:

31:37.330 --> 31:38.999
It's foreseeable
that cigar-smoking

31:39.032 --> 31:40.601
breeds contempt
between men and women,

31:40.634 --> 31:43.604
and when you promote
institutions like cigar clubs

31:43.637 --> 31:46.206
which serve to segregate
husbands and wives,

31:46.239 --> 31:47.608
it's foreseeable
that it could lead

31:47.641 --> 31:49.309
to some marital estrangement.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.411
When you publish magazines
that seduce men

31:51.444 --> 31:53.046
with imagery of success
and affluence

31:53.079 --> 31:55.549
that goes along
with smoking a Cohiba,

31:55.582 --> 31:57.283
it's foreseeable that some men
will fall for it,

31:57.317 --> 31:59.052
especially men
like Mr. Pinkner,

31:59.085 --> 32:00.086
who, by his own testimony,

32:00.120 --> 32:02.422
started smoking just because
it made him feel good,

32:02.455 --> 32:05.425
made him feel commensurate
with the luster
of your magazine.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.227
Will that survive
a judgment?

32:07.260 --> 32:08.328
Probably not.

32:08.361 --> 32:09.630
Will we survive
summary judgment?

32:09.663 --> 32:11.565
Yes,
and when we get to trial,

32:11.598 --> 32:14.134
you can be sure we will be
playing the addiction card.

32:14.167 --> 32:16.469
Mr. Pinkner had no choice
but to smoke these things

32:16.503 --> 32:17.638
once he became addicted.

32:17.671 --> 32:19.172
Do we like that word,

32:19.205 --> 32:21.274
"addicted,
addicted, addicted"?

32:22.175 --> 32:24.310
And we certainly
don't want any forum
asking that question,

32:24.344 --> 32:25.411
do we, Mr. Stewart?

32:26.412 --> 32:28.048
Because it still remains
the dirty little secret

32:28.081 --> 32:29.583
of the cigar manufacturers.

32:29.616 --> 32:31.084
The attorneys general
of every state

32:31.117 --> 32:32.252
have already targeted
cigarette companies.

32:32.285 --> 32:36.089
You don't see characters on TV
puffing Pall Malls anymore.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.592
But with cigars,
they still remain untouched.

32:38.625 --> 32:41.194
They're still trendy,
politically correct.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.229
And the idea that,
that could change,

32:43.263 --> 32:45.198
billions and billions
of dollars --

32:45.231 --> 32:47.133
"addicted, addicted,
addicted."

32:47.167 --> 32:50.070
This law firm beat
the tobacco companies
once with cigarettes.

32:50.103 --> 32:51.471
I'm all set
to take you on here.

32:51.505 --> 32:55.275
Cancer of the lip, tongue,
throat, larynx, esophagus,

32:55.308 --> 32:57.744
pulmonary lung disease,
coronary heart disease --

32:57.778 --> 33:00.714
All of these risks
come into play in this case.

33:00.747 --> 33:03.784
Why?
Because my client testified
that her health concerns

33:03.817 --> 33:06.386
attributed to the arguments
that led to estrangement.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.421
Fear of cancer is an issue.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.423
Were her fears reasonable?
Question of fact.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.458
You people peddle carcinogens,

33:12.492 --> 33:14.695
toxic little cancer sticks
with carbon monoxide,

33:14.728 --> 33:16.663
nicotine, hydrogen cyanide,

33:16.697 --> 33:18.164
and people
still think it's cool.

33:18.198 --> 33:19.332
By the time
this trial is over,

33:19.365 --> 33:20.767
I will make you
seem so uncool --

33:20.801 --> 33:22.435
and I'll get the attention,
you know why?

33:22.468 --> 33:24.170
Because I have
a track record already

33:24.204 --> 33:25.371
of beating
the tobacco companies.

33:25.405 --> 33:28.308
All the law journals
are waiting to see
who I take on next.

33:28.341 --> 33:30.276
It's you.
So, keep laughing.

33:30.310 --> 33:32.579
Make my day.
It's you.

33:44.525 --> 33:46.359
He saw what he thought
was a gun.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.194
What was he supposed to do?

33:48.228 --> 33:50.697
Even the store owner was
going after his own rifle.

33:50.731 --> 33:53.600
He thought he was
about to be robbed.

33:53.634 --> 33:56.069
You heard
my client's testimony.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.604
This was a mistake.

33:57.638 --> 34:01.575
He saw Will Bradley
reach for his gun.

34:02.175 --> 34:03.844
HELEN: The victim
never grabbed his gun.

34:03.877 --> 34:07.113
It was found
inside his jacket.

34:07.147 --> 34:11.552
We also heard testimony
from Mr. Armstrong's
former girlfriend.

34:11.585 --> 34:15.388
She told us how this man
would discriminate
against some blacks,

34:15.420 --> 34:17.223
how he was prejudiced
towards kids

34:17.257 --> 34:20.293
because of their color,
their poverty.

34:20.326 --> 34:23.730
He walked into the store,
made a judgment,

34:23.764 --> 34:25.264
and started shooting.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.634
REBECCA: And there is
no evidence to suggest that.

34:27.668 --> 34:30.170
None. And nobody
in the department

34:30.203 --> 34:31.605
ever heard him
say the things

34:31.638 --> 34:33.540
his ex-girlfriend
says he said,

34:33.574 --> 34:36.208
because he never said them.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.679
HELEN: What would be
her motive to lie?

34:38.712 --> 34:41.848
A lot of trouble to go to
just because of her feelings.

34:41.882 --> 34:44.551
What would be Mr. Armstrong's
motive to shoot?

34:44.585 --> 34:47.588
The commonwealth has offered
no motive whatsoever here.

34:47.621 --> 34:50.623
Why? Because this
was an accident.

34:50.657 --> 34:56.096
This is a police officer
sitting at that table.

34:57.664 --> 34:59.332
A good man...

34:59.733 --> 35:02.603
Who thought he was
preventing a robbery,

35:02.636 --> 35:05.305
and let's ask ourselves...

35:05.338 --> 35:07.340
Why did Will Bradley
have that gun?

35:07.373 --> 35:09.209
Let's ask ourselves,

35:09.242 --> 35:12.212
if Craig Armstrong
hadn't come in,

35:12.245 --> 35:14.414
what would have happened?

35:14.447 --> 35:17.718
Maybe the store owner
would be dead.

35:17.751 --> 35:20.386
It's so easy for us
to second-guess.

35:20.420 --> 35:21.922
This happened in a second,

35:21.955 --> 35:25.291
and Craig Armstrong
had to make a quick call.

35:25.325 --> 35:26.727
HELEN: And he just
opened fire --

35:26.760 --> 35:28.361
that's the call he made.

35:28.394 --> 35:30.496
He shot a man three times.

35:30.531 --> 35:32.733
The call he made was murder.

35:32.766 --> 35:36.302
Now, do we just excuse that
because he's a cop?

35:36.336 --> 35:38.839
(sighs)
That's your call.

35:39.873 --> 35:41.642
(crowd murmuring)

35:44.511 --> 35:45.912
(sighs)

35:48.882 --> 35:50.917
$270,000.

35:51.618 --> 35:53.186
What did you say?

35:53.820 --> 35:56.189
Minus contingency
and costs,

35:56.222 --> 35:58.525
you'll net out
around 175 or so.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.927
How-How ?
I-I don't understand.

36:00.961 --> 36:02.763
You all but assured me
I had no case.

36:02.796 --> 36:04.631
You didn't,

36:04.665 --> 36:06.199
but that's the thing
about this business --

36:07.233 --> 36:08.569
The merits
of the actual case

36:08.602 --> 36:11.237
sometimes have nothing to do
with the outcome. Ha ha.

36:11.572 --> 36:12.606
My God.

36:12.639 --> 36:13.774
(gasps)

36:13.807 --> 36:15.809
Congratulations.

36:15.842 --> 36:17.544
(sighs)

36:18.645 --> 36:19.713
Lindsay.

36:20.847 --> 36:21.782
Can we sue her?

36:21.815 --> 36:22.516
Who?

36:22.549 --> 36:23.416
The woman
he fell in love with.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.586
The other woman --
She knew he was married.

36:25.619 --> 36:26.553
Martha.

36:26.587 --> 36:28.855
Alienation of affection.
Same cause of action.

36:30.490 --> 36:33.259
I think you're all
out of people to sue
on this one.

36:34.995 --> 36:36.930
You need to move on now.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.267
What am I gonna do?

36:42.903 --> 36:46.840
Just go home
with $175,000?

36:48.509 --> 36:50.276
He's gone, Martha.

36:51.277 --> 36:52.879
You have to move on.

36:55.916 --> 36:57.350
Yeah.

37:00.554 --> 37:01.822
Yeah.

37:06.426 --> 37:07.694
Thank you.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.495
Sure.

37:11.364 --> 37:12.498
Hey.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.268
You won.

37:22.643 --> 37:24.244
(door closes)

37:45.065 --> 37:47.433
JUDGE PATRICK: Will the
defendant please rise?

37:48.434 --> 37:50.504
Mr. Foreman, you have reached
a unanimous verdict?

37:51.071 --> 37:51.972
We have, your honor.

37:52.005 --> 37:53.006
JUDGE PATRICK: What say you?

37:54.007 --> 37:56.610
In the matter of
the Commonwealth vs. Armstrong

37:56.643 --> 37:57.878
on the charge of murder two,

37:57.911 --> 38:00.313
we find the defendant,
Craig Armstrong,

38:00.346 --> 38:01.582
not guilty.

38:02.549 --> 38:04.417
On the charge
of manslaughter,

38:04.450 --> 38:06.687
we find the defendant
not guilty.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.823
(crowd murmuring)

38:11.491 --> 38:13.426
JUDGE PATRICK: Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury.

38:13.459 --> 38:16.029
This court is adjourned.

38:16.062 --> 38:17.998
(gavel pounds)

38:20.100 --> 38:21.501
You did it.

38:21.535 --> 38:22.736
Thank you.

38:22.769 --> 38:24.437
Congratulations.

38:24.470 --> 38:25.639
Thank you.

38:26.907 --> 38:28.909
Congratulations, Craig.

38:30.143 --> 38:31.545
You can go.

38:35.516 --> 38:37.417
I can live with myself.

38:37.951 --> 38:41.822
Well, uh,
that's the difference
between us, I guess.

38:58.138 --> 39:00.440
(sighs)

39:02.643 --> 39:05.612
(sighs) Case is over.
Week is over.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.080
Let's go home.

39:07.814 --> 39:08.882
I'm ready.

39:09.149 --> 39:11.117
You've got everybody
stunned, Lindsay.

39:11.151 --> 39:12.953
How you manufactured
that case,

39:12.986 --> 39:14.020
got them to pay money...

39:14.655 --> 39:16.422
I know the fear
of a trial scared them,

39:16.456 --> 39:18.725
but still you sued
a cigar company

39:18.759 --> 39:20.627
for breaking up a marriage.

39:21.728 --> 39:22.896
Yeah.

39:23.930 --> 39:25.431
You don't seem too thrilled

39:25.465 --> 39:27.601
for someone who just pulled
a rabbit out of a hat.

39:27.968 --> 39:30.136
You know what scares me,
Bobby?

39:30.170 --> 39:32.539
A cigar really
did break them up.

39:39.913 --> 39:42.015
They were a close couple.

39:42.583 --> 39:44.585
He lost his job,

39:44.618 --> 39:46.687
suffered some esteem problems,
some depression,

39:46.720 --> 39:50.056
and he bought a few of those
silly cigar magazines, and...

39:50.791 --> 39:53.860
saw the beautiful people
in expensive clothes
puffing away,

39:53.894 --> 39:57.531
and he basically tried
to escape to that world...

39:57.564 --> 39:59.733
by smoking cigars
and joining those clubs,

39:59.766 --> 40:03.537
and he suddenly
was in this universe

40:03.570 --> 40:05.906
that excluded Martha,
and they...

40:06.740 --> 40:07.974
So, you think
the cigar company

40:08.008 --> 40:09.643
should really
be held liable?

40:10.777 --> 40:12.012
No.

40:15.181 --> 40:17.183
I'm thinking...

40:17.217 --> 40:20.987
(sighs)
how fragile marriage is.

40:22.088 --> 40:23.957
Lose a job...

40:25.158 --> 40:27.994
suffer depression,
seek escape.

40:28.028 --> 40:29.763
A loving couple.

40:29.796 --> 40:32.165
And they were loving,
I saw them.

40:33.099 --> 40:34.568
I knew them.

40:37.504 --> 40:39.105
House of cards.

40:42.709 --> 40:45.045
I'm never gonna
stop loving you.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.215
How do you know?

40:50.951 --> 40:53.620
I've only just begun
to love you.

41:04.230 --> 41:06.499
This I know.

41:08.535 --> 41:11.505
(music playing)

41:17.744 --> 41:21.782
(music playing)

41:44.204 --> 41:45.138
WOMAN: You stinker!
