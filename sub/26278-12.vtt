00:45.468 --> 00:49.354
Come here. Come here.
Ready? Go get the stick.

00:49.479 --> 00:51.456
Good job.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.227
Come on, Reva!

01:04.747 --> 01:07.245
She ran to the nearest
house with a telephone.

01:07.370 --> 01:08.924
Did she say what she had seen?

01:08.941 --> 01:10.941
She thought it was a body.

01:13.642 --> 01:15.411
It's just over there.

01:52.209 --> 01:54.653
He looks about 11 years old.

01:54.778 --> 01:57.423
Any idea how long the
body has been buried here?

01:57.455 --> 01:58.953
It's difficult to say.

01:58.969 --> 02:01.189
The dryness of the soil
and the lack of body fat

02:01.194 --> 02:04.414
- may have slowed down decomposition.
- An approximation?

02:04.478 --> 02:06.361
Given the minimal putrefaction,

02:06.409 --> 02:09.506
- I'd say a week at most.
- And the cause of death?

02:09.521 --> 02:12.506
I'll have to examine him at
the morgue to determine a cause.

02:12.544 --> 02:13.854
Thank you.

02:13.891 --> 02:15.753
The contents of his pockets.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.336
Red clay dust,

02:19.461 --> 02:21.689
the kind used for making bricks.

02:21.865 --> 02:23.737
It's under his fingernails as well.

02:23.780 --> 02:26.390
There's a brickworks near here.

02:27.310 --> 02:30.212
- As soon as you can, please, Miss Hart.
- Of course.

02:42.887 --> 02:46.089
63 pages already, William.

02:46.352 --> 02:48.918
Most of them footnotes.

02:49.196 --> 02:51.999
No doubt a bracing read.

02:52.209 --> 02:55.327
Doctor Ogden! I've been
looking everywhere for you.

02:55.354 --> 02:58.162
Miss Newsome, this area
is reserved for doctors.

02:58.216 --> 03:01.739
Oh, you're like that, are you?

03:02.474 --> 03:04.332
Not me,

03:04.457 --> 03:08.050
but you have just started here. I
would hate to see you reprimanded.

03:08.324 --> 03:11.907
- Shouldn't you be on your ward?
- There's nothing to do there.

03:12.261 --> 03:14.397
- No patients?
- There was one,

03:14.413 --> 03:16.221
but she died. Best thing for her.

03:16.301 --> 03:17.680
Poor dear.

03:18.707 --> 03:20.290
Ooh, what's this?

03:20.846 --> 03:23.948
The Detective and I have been
commissioned to write a book.

03:23.975 --> 03:25.477
Oh, how lovely!

03:25.531 --> 03:27.162
A love story?

03:27.509 --> 03:31.119
Not exactly. More of a book
about how crimes are solved.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.163
Who cares how crimes are solved
as long as they're solved?

03:34.489 --> 03:36.832
Yes, well, some people do.

03:37.569 --> 03:40.286
No offense, but it sounds dreary.

03:41.665 --> 03:43.949
And it's confirmed.

03:47.778 --> 03:50.093
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

04:01.176 --> 04:03.187
Perhaps more tea.

04:03.385 --> 04:05.813
The boys that work here come and go.

04:06.016 --> 04:08.049
I don't pay much attention to them.

04:08.091 --> 04:10.445
- Where do they come from?
- Orphanages.

04:10.471 --> 04:12.584
Good workers for half the price.

04:12.611 --> 04:15.215
Really. And where are they now?

04:15.450 --> 04:17.232
They only work mornings.

04:17.510 --> 04:21.370
They do their schooling in
the afternoon. Waste of time.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.949
Yours or theirs?

04:23.275 --> 04:26.532
Theirs. I don't imagine
they'll amount to much.

04:26.586 --> 04:29.736
Is that so? You just use them

04:29.747 --> 04:31.546
- to line your pockets?
- Ahem.

04:31.547 --> 04:34.234
We'll need to speak with
some of your employees.

04:34.359 --> 04:38.321
Sure, they'll be happy to have an excuse

04:38.342 --> 04:40.803
to sit on their duffs. Listen up, men.

04:41.247 --> 04:44.044
The Constabulary have
a few questions for you.

04:44.070 --> 04:46.509
Tell 'em what they want to
know and then get back to work.

04:46.798 --> 04:49.686
The body of a boy was
discovered not far from here

04:49.723 --> 04:52.520
and we have reason to believe
that he worked at this site.

04:52.558 --> 04:55.916
He was 11 or 12 years old, wearing
a black-and-white striped shirt,

04:55.953 --> 04:58.815
- with rope suspenders.
- Blonde hair?

04:59.045 --> 05:00.222
Yes.

05:00.554 --> 05:02.795
Sounds a lot like Wesley Seaver.

05:02.843 --> 05:06.373
- And your name, sir?
- This is Hiram Taylor.

05:06.405 --> 05:08.175
Seen the boy you described working here.

05:08.228 --> 05:09.897
Can you tell us anything else about him?

05:09.945 --> 05:12.587
He was sent over from the
orphanage to learn the trade.

05:12.764 --> 05:14.593
Would you happen to
know which orphanage?

05:14.652 --> 05:16.839
Be the one on Broadview, I'd wager.

05:17.786 --> 05:19.251
Thank you.

05:20.711 --> 05:22.387
Wesley Seaver.

05:37.372 --> 05:38.623
Can I help you?

05:38.624 --> 05:40.319
Toronto Constabulary.

05:40.444 --> 05:43.073
We understand a boy by
the name of Wesley Seaver

05:43.094 --> 05:44.918
- was a ward of this orphanage.
- He was.

05:44.934 --> 05:47.175
But he ran away about a week ago.

05:48.095 --> 05:50.598
What would give him cause to run away?

05:51.074 --> 05:52.300
He was that kind.

05:52.425 --> 05:54.792
A body we believe to
be that of Wesley Seaver

05:54.834 --> 05:57.011
was discovered not far from here.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.161
That's terrible.

06:00.616 --> 06:02.733
You don't seem surprised.

06:02.759 --> 06:05.466
Well, Wesley was always
a bit rowdy and wild.

06:05.664 --> 06:08.104
The home's director and the
other boys will tell you the same.

06:08.552 --> 06:10.969
I'd like to speak with
the director, please.

06:11.415 --> 06:13.036
I'll show you the way.

06:13.684 --> 06:15.751
I'll talk to the boys.

06:20.009 --> 06:23.695
- When was Wesley Seaver last seen alive?
- I don't know.

06:24.043 --> 06:25.601
I last saw him in the kitchen,

06:25.614 --> 06:29.018
scouring pots and pans as I prepared
evening tea for the Director.

06:29.143 --> 06:31.955
- This was the night the boy went missing?
- Yes.

06:32.001 --> 06:35.615
Normally the Director gets his
own tea, but he was feeling poorly.

06:37.634 --> 06:39.263
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

06:39.309 --> 06:42.595
- Toronto Constabulary.
- How can I help you?

06:43.922 --> 06:45.992
Brother Duvalier?

06:47.556 --> 06:49.696
William Murdoch. I was a student

06:49.712 --> 06:52.293
at the Nova Scotia
Jesuit School for Boys.

06:53.885 --> 06:55.867
William Murdoch?!

06:56.066 --> 06:57.538
Yes.

06:58.232 --> 07:02.074
Come in, come in!

07:04.985 --> 07:07.062
Please, take a seat.

07:09.317 --> 07:10.816
So,

07:11.068 --> 07:13.995
you went on to be an officer of the law!

07:14.216 --> 07:15.830
That surprises me greatly.

07:15.846 --> 07:18.810
I rather imagined you becoming
a scholar or a scientist or such.

07:19.809 --> 07:21.675
What brings you here today?

07:22.248 --> 07:25.938
I'm here to make inquiries
about Wesley Seaver.

07:26.063 --> 07:29.329
- His body was discovered earlier today.
- No!

07:30.664 --> 07:32.188
Wesley Seaver...

07:35.194 --> 07:37.297
What have you come to, lad?

07:40.225 --> 07:44.167
He ran off six days ago.

07:44.545 --> 07:47.163
- You knew he'd been missing?
- Indeed.

07:47.704 --> 07:49.501
Why did no one search for him?

07:49.517 --> 07:52.802
Young Master Seaver had left us
before. He had always come back.

07:53.538 --> 07:56.465
- When did you last see him?
- In the afternoon.

07:56.839 --> 07:58.952
I'd had to discipline him
for some errant behaviour...

07:58.973 --> 08:00.734
all too common with Seaver.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.474
Nonetheless, he...

08:03.467 --> 08:06.926
was a very bright boy.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.218
I had hopes for him.

08:10.884 --> 08:13.002
Sometimes they disappoint you.

08:16.729 --> 08:18.479
The day Wesley disappeared,

08:18.810 --> 08:21.722
he'd stood up to one of the
teachers and got caned for it.

08:22.227 --> 08:25.276
- Which teacher did the caning?
- Brother Duvalier.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.706
He always does the canings.

08:28.820 --> 08:32.063
- Does that happen frequently?
- Yes, all the time!

08:32.405 --> 08:34.172
Especially to Wesley.

08:37.368 --> 08:39.224
Duvalier had it in for him.

08:40.207 --> 08:43.104
That little fellow appears
to be down in the dumps.

08:43.162 --> 08:44.491
That's Felix.

08:45.296 --> 08:47.309
Him and Wesley were best friends.

08:47.556 --> 08:49.801
Thank you. I'll have a word with him.

08:57.302 --> 08:59.142
Hello there, young man.

09:02.649 --> 09:04.084
May I?

09:05.320 --> 09:07.149
I read this when I was your age.

09:07.601 --> 09:10.114
I liked it very much.
Are you enjoying it?

09:12.752 --> 09:14.603
You like reading, do you?

09:15.454 --> 09:18.035
- Yes.
- So do I.

09:18.555 --> 09:20.468
What kinds of books do you favour?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.724
Adventures.

09:23.107 --> 09:24.916
I'm going to read
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i> next.

09:24.926 --> 09:27.644
Ah, that's even better than this one.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.024
That's what Wesley said.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.754
A good friend is a rare thing.

09:40.976 --> 09:43.289
This is where the boy was last seen.

09:44.361 --> 09:46.895
He may have gone out that door.

09:48.481 --> 09:50.920
Any thoughts as to why he'd run?

09:52.450 --> 09:54.137
To avoid a beating.

09:54.678 --> 09:58.978
So out he goes, and somewhere
out there encounters his murderer?

10:00.539 --> 10:02.305
Master Smith.

10:02.430 --> 10:03.919
If you're gonna hang about the kitchen,

10:03.940 --> 10:06.116
you might just as well be
doing something productive.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.996
Cook has some potatoes over
there that need peeling.

10:11.030 --> 10:13.033
Do you think Wesley's killer

10:13.158 --> 10:15.036
was lying in wait out there?

10:15.351 --> 10:16.970
That's a possibility.

10:17.554 --> 10:19.099
We'll find him.

10:20.619 --> 10:23.104
You've lost none of
your confidence, I see.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.126
Tell me, William,

10:39.315 --> 10:41.964
- are you married?
- I am.

10:42.022 --> 10:44.845
- You have a family?
- No. Not as yet.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.259
That will come.

10:47.878 --> 10:49.319
This wife...

10:50.407 --> 10:52.163
I'd very much like to meet her.

10:58.230 --> 11:00.700
Oh! Hello.

11:01.189 --> 11:03.770
So, how's it going?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.967
Let's see.

11:06.230 --> 11:11.067
"My name is Dr. Julia Ogden and I'm
a coroner for the city of Toronto."

11:15.372 --> 11:18.978
If you two are such experts
in this nasty business,

11:19.157 --> 11:21.354
wouldn't all of that
already be in the title?

11:21.785 --> 11:23.878
Yes, I suppose.

11:23.946 --> 11:26.563
I'm just having a hard
time getting started.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.873
Well, it seems to me
the problem is obvious.

11:30.889 --> 11:32.171
- It is?
- Mm-hmm.

11:32.214 --> 11:34.064
You need a proper place to write.

11:34.074 --> 11:37.002
When I wrote my book, I had
them build me a lovely study.

11:37.127 --> 11:39.105
- You wrote a book?
- I did.

11:39.988 --> 11:41.821
What about?

11:41.822 --> 11:44.787
My Adventures As A Young Woman
<i>Growing Up In Mimico</i>

11:44.798 --> 11:46.402
<i>And Places Abroad.</i>

11:47.458 --> 11:49.792
- Was it published?
- I'm not sure.

11:49.829 --> 11:51.249
Due to the nature of the material,

11:51.254 --> 11:54.277
I had to submit it
under an assumed name.

11:54.402 --> 11:57.083
- And?
- I forgot the name I assumed,

11:57.094 --> 11:59.296
so I don't really know
what happened to it.

11:59.421 --> 12:01.319
I could always write a
second book, I suppose,

12:01.362 --> 12:04.967
but nothing truly happens
after one is married, anyway.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.611
- I don't know if that is true...
- As for your writing,

12:07.627 --> 12:08.999
let me handle everything.

12:09.009 --> 12:12.126
I will furnish you the most
beautiful little hovel so you can

12:12.310 --> 12:14.828
create your masterpiece. Hm?

12:21.983 --> 12:24.574
I've found no broken
bones or any other injury

12:24.590 --> 12:26.115
that would indicate a fall.

12:26.173 --> 12:27.971
Then explain the bruising.

12:28.096 --> 12:30.163
The victim's blood shows anemia,

12:30.189 --> 12:33.285
which most likely exacerbated
the extent of the contusions.

12:33.816 --> 12:37.358
So we don't know yet how it
relates to the boy's death.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.139
It's quite vexing...

12:39.355 --> 12:41.258
but I will get to the bottom of it,

12:42.020 --> 12:43.597
I assure you.

12:46.519 --> 12:48.982
When boys leave our protection
to go back to the streets,

12:49.013 --> 12:51.016
they've bought a one-way ticket to jail

12:51.216 --> 12:53.135
or a pauper's grave.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.324
How did he come into your care?

12:57.391 --> 13:01.239
His mother was killed by a
trolley car several years back.

13:01.975 --> 13:03.720
And his father?

13:03.845 --> 13:06.795
I don't believe the boy ever met him.

13:07.615 --> 13:10.300
No child should have to
live under that circumstance.

13:10.321 --> 13:15.163
My sentiments exactly. Which is
why I founded the Boys' Home...

13:15.383 --> 13:18.747
to do my small part in
rectifying that situation.

13:19.772 --> 13:21.487
Why did you leave Nova Scotia?

13:22.359 --> 13:23.857
Well...

13:24.837 --> 13:26.544
The school you attended

13:26.669 --> 13:28.651
closed for lack of funding.

13:28.907 --> 13:30.196
So you came here.

13:31.889 --> 13:35.338
I knew that the need
in Toronto was immense

13:35.385 --> 13:37.823
and that charitable funding
was more readily accessible.

13:37.844 --> 13:40.220
So here I am, running a Boys' Home

13:40.241 --> 13:43.957
according to the same principles
that governed your education.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.826
- And those are?
- Treat the boys like intelligent human beings,

13:47.836 --> 13:49.402
capable of doing good.

13:49.418 --> 13:53.876
Instill in them regular,
methodical habits and cleanliness.

13:53.928 --> 13:56.157
And transform them into honourable youth

13:56.162 --> 13:58.259
who'll become good
men like your husband.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.335
Of course, there are others
who need a sterner approach.

14:07.252 --> 14:10.880
Are you aware of the
work of Mr. John Kelso?

14:11.436 --> 14:14.154
I am. I share several of his ideas.

14:14.196 --> 14:16.793
We both agree that labour is elevating.

14:16.851 --> 14:18.938
Our boys are employed in the trades,

14:18.948 --> 14:20.384
training for future work.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.857
William was one of the exceptions.

14:25.136 --> 14:28.269
We encouraged him to use
the talents God gave him.

14:28.290 --> 14:29.525
And here he is,

14:29.862 --> 14:32.133
a perfect testament to our success.

14:32.475 --> 14:36.302
And do you agree with Mr. Kelso's
views regarding corporal punishment?

14:36.612 --> 14:38.362
I do not.

14:39.345 --> 14:42.741
I firmly believe it works towards
the betterment of our boys.

14:43.319 --> 14:44.560
Really?

14:44.685 --> 14:47.215
I don't believe that corporal
punishment of children

14:47.220 --> 14:49.801
can produce any positive
outcome whatsoever.

14:49.832 --> 14:51.231
I disagree.

14:51.620 --> 14:54.427
Corporal discipline is necessary

14:54.496 --> 14:58.144
for order to be maintained in
an institution such as ours.

14:58.386 --> 15:01.939
If that is the case, perhaps the
institution isn't being properly run.

15:02.064 --> 15:03.474
Julia...

15:03.599 --> 15:06.996
Yours is a sentimental attitude
rather than a practical one.

15:07.022 --> 15:08.778
Not sentimental at all.

15:08.946 --> 15:10.875
When you commit
violence against a child,

15:10.896 --> 15:13.924
- you do irreparable harm.
- You haven't yet raised one.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.200
If you had,

15:16.526 --> 15:19.496
you'd understand that
discipline is necessary.

15:19.796 --> 15:22.660
And I don't agree. William?

16:04.415 --> 16:05.865
William?

16:07.174 --> 16:08.862
Are you all right?

16:09.834 --> 16:11.468
I couldn't fall asleep.

16:11.474 --> 16:13.097
I didn't want to disturb you.

16:14.349 --> 16:17.413
It disturbs me when you're
not here in bed with me.

16:18.097 --> 16:19.485
Come back.

16:46.693 --> 16:48.359
It's canine.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.404
Belonged to a wolf.

16:50.824 --> 16:53.154
An animal tooth and a rabbit's foot.

16:53.196 --> 16:55.776
Wesley Seaver was a curious boy.

16:56.154 --> 16:57.705
And a rebellious one.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.254
Could this mean anything?

17:02.036 --> 17:04.092
Not any more than the rest of this.

17:05.327 --> 17:06.583
Excuse me, sir.

17:06.708 --> 17:09.353
Another boy from the orphanage
has just been reported missing.

17:14.141 --> 17:16.501
The missing boy is Paul Smith.

17:16.527 --> 17:18.472
I spoke with him yesterday.

17:18.550 --> 17:21.898
When Paul didn't appear for morning
mass, I sent someone to find him.

17:22.135 --> 17:23.753
Paul's bed hadn't been slept in.

17:23.878 --> 17:26.440
Any reason the boy would
leave on his own accord?

17:26.813 --> 17:28.086
I don't know.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.848
If you'll excuse me, I
should attend to the boys.

17:31.973 --> 17:34.923
- They'll have questions.
- We'll be in shortly.

17:43.659 --> 17:45.793
A wheelbarrow?

17:45.918 --> 17:47.512
Certainly looks like it.

17:48.474 --> 17:51.575
A way to convey a body
from one place to another.

17:51.743 --> 17:54.660
Or hopefully just a wheelbarrow.

18:00.894 --> 18:02.377
Watts.

18:02.424 --> 18:03.801
Blood.

18:06.830 --> 18:08.323
Detective.

18:19.082 --> 18:20.370
Recently used.

18:20.401 --> 18:21.968
We need to get some men down here.

18:21.989 --> 18:24.565
See if we can find somewhere
the ground's been disturbed.

18:26.342 --> 18:27.976
A moment.

18:28.523 --> 18:30.053
Hello there.

18:30.127 --> 18:31.677
Where did Paul go?

18:32.355 --> 18:34.195
That's what we're going to find out.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.115
Felix, is there anything you
can tell us that might help us?

18:37.309 --> 18:38.681
No.

18:39.281 --> 18:40.999
Please find him.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.649
He was nice to me like Wesley.

18:43.874 --> 18:46.603
- Nice in what way?
- He knew I liked to read,

18:46.728 --> 18:48.454
so he gave me books.

18:48.512 --> 18:50.410
Where did he get these books?

18:50.535 --> 18:52.239
He maybe stole them.

18:52.850 --> 18:54.925
He had all kinds of
things under his bed.

18:55.498 --> 18:57.922
- Can you show me?
- There you are!

18:58.269 --> 18:59.835
You're late for class.

19:00.019 --> 19:02.216
I was talking to the Detective.

19:02.631 --> 19:04.545
I'm showing him where Paul's bed is.

19:05.096 --> 19:07.893
I'll take care of that. Off you go.

19:14.474 --> 19:15.905
All right.

19:18.274 --> 19:20.756
How would he have
gotten hold of all this?

19:21.218 --> 19:23.237
He didn't have that much pocket money.

19:24.062 --> 19:26.101
Might he have stolen them?

19:26.317 --> 19:28.546
I suppose it's possible.

19:33.207 --> 19:36.435
- I'd like to take this.
- Mm-hmm.

19:44.452 --> 19:46.844
You're not busy. Please
tell me you're not busy.

19:46.865 --> 19:50.030
- I'm not busy.
- Goodie. Come here.

19:51.838 --> 19:53.073
Open it.

19:53.094 --> 19:55.150
What? Go on, open it.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.868
- Tada!
- Ruth, you did this?

20:04.901 --> 20:07.635
Oh, not only me. A few workmen helped.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.585
- And the medical supplies that were in here?
- Sit, sit, sit, sit.

20:12.774 --> 20:15.842
This is the place where
you'll create your masterpiece

20:15.863 --> 20:17.656
without a distraction in the world.

20:17.839 --> 20:20.042
The Q is a little winky-wonk.

20:20.068 --> 20:21.535
It's my favourite letter.

20:21.561 --> 20:24.263
I used it a lot when I
was writing my manuscript.

20:24.821 --> 20:27.743
- This is very thoughtful of you.
- Well,

20:27.785 --> 20:29.905
when I saw how well your
husband was doing, I thought,

20:30.029 --> 20:31.690
we can't have that, can we?

20:31.815 --> 20:34.551
No. No, we can't.

20:34.903 --> 20:37.021
Oh, no, you can't start yet.

20:37.146 --> 20:39.154
- I can't?
- No.

20:39.207 --> 20:41.835
You have to clear your mind
of every thought and worry

20:41.861 --> 20:44.553
before you can enter
your fictional world.

20:44.574 --> 20:48.362
- It's not exactly a work of fiction.
- Regardless. Get up.

20:49.627 --> 20:53.471
This is an exercise I've
always found very useful.

20:53.671 --> 20:55.572
You just stare at the wall

20:55.955 --> 20:58.074
and clear your mind of all thoughts.

21:08.038 --> 21:09.648
Done.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.337
You try.

21:22.304 --> 21:24.978
- Are you still thinking?
- Yes.

21:30.261 --> 21:31.908
Still?

21:32.397 --> 21:34.744
Perhaps this isn't for you.

21:36.681 --> 21:40.171
Sir. This arrived for
you in the morning post.

21:46.585 --> 21:49.659
It's from Paul Smith, the missing boy.

21:50.126 --> 21:52.596
Sent before he disappeared, sir?

21:52.787 --> 21:55.901
- Yes.
- Detective, I have something.

21:55.949 --> 21:57.210
So do I.

21:57.335 --> 21:59.965
I just received this from
Paul Smith, the missing boy.

22:00.133 --> 22:02.699
He states that Brother
Duvalier killed Wesley Seaver

22:02.726 --> 22:05.412
- and is now after him.
- Curious.

22:05.985 --> 22:08.045
That's not the word that I would use.

22:08.082 --> 22:12.198
No, what's curious is I found this
toy among young Paul's possessions.

22:12.214 --> 22:15.635
- It's expensive and quite rare.
- May I see that?

22:15.887 --> 22:18.174
There's only one store
in Toronto that sells it.

22:18.201 --> 22:20.482
I checked their sales records
and found out who bought it.

22:20.518 --> 22:22.038
It was Hiram Taylor.

22:22.064 --> 22:24.098
- The man from the brickworks.
- One and the same.

22:24.124 --> 22:26.154
You think it's possible
he and Brother Duvalier

22:26.165 --> 22:28.598
are involved in something
nefarious together?

22:28.877 --> 22:30.349
Bring in Mr. Taylor.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.387
- And Henry, get Brother Duvalier's fingermarks.
- Yes, sir.

22:33.419 --> 22:36.793
If he objects, tell him we're
simply eliminating suspects.

22:37.007 --> 22:38.444
Henry.

22:38.854 --> 22:40.036
The train.

22:49.399 --> 22:51.176
Good day, Miss Hart.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.176
An accusation's been levelled
that this boy was beaten to death.

22:55.197 --> 22:57.078
Would that be consistent
with your findings?

22:57.413 --> 23:00.481
There was no single blow
sufficient enough to cause death.

23:00.606 --> 23:03.906
However, the boy did
suffer subcutaneous hematoma

23:03.932 --> 23:05.951
which indicates the
blood loss was vascular

23:05.988 --> 23:07.817
and not from injury to a major organ.

23:07.875 --> 23:10.672
And if this vascular loss
were significant enough...

23:10.730 --> 23:12.243
The heart stops pumping blood.

23:12.259 --> 23:15.050
The organs shut down.
It's called blood shock.

23:16.653 --> 23:18.998
What was Wesley Seaver beaten with?

23:19.381 --> 23:21.169
That I can't say.

23:21.437 --> 23:24.413
The bruising has obscured
any individual marks.

23:26.308 --> 23:28.135
There may be a way.

23:33.282 --> 23:35.173
Can I help you, Detective?

23:35.199 --> 23:37.718
No, I'm looking for Hiram Taylor.

23:37.820 --> 23:39.179
He's done for the day.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.592
- Do you know where he lives?
- I don't.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.726
What can you tell me about him?

23:43.789 --> 23:45.960
Good worker, keeps to himself.

23:46.061 --> 23:48.541
Well, except for with those boys.

23:49.051 --> 23:50.798
He's rather friendly with some of them,

23:50.899 --> 23:53.734
- one in particular.
- Which boy is that?

23:53.836 --> 23:57.492
A young lad named, uh... Paul Smith.

23:59.511 --> 24:01.275
Thank you.

24:07.589 --> 24:09.528
What colour would the surface wounds be

24:09.551 --> 24:11.986
if they weren't obscured
by the subsequent bruising?

24:12.009 --> 24:14.422
The broken capillaries
would be a reddish color.

24:15.005 --> 24:19.961
Perhaps there is a way
to reveal the pattern

24:20.135 --> 24:22.510
of the original abrasions.

24:34.216 --> 24:36.350
So what exactly are we seeing?

24:36.475 --> 24:39.325
The red filter inhibits all
other colours of the spectrum.

24:39.348 --> 24:41.225
Anything that's red is highlighted

24:41.238 --> 24:43.251
while other colours fade away.

24:43.672 --> 24:45.775
So the broken capillaries are red,

24:45.796 --> 24:47.588
therefore both areas are evident.

24:47.713 --> 24:51.567
Yes, revealing how many times
and how severely the boy was hit.

24:51.583 --> 24:54.485
There appear to be more
than twenty strokes.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.098
Sir...

24:57.544 --> 25:00.868
the fingermarks on the shovel
match those of Brother Duvalier.

25:03.506 --> 25:06.791
- I haven't been able to find Hiram Taylor.
- It doesn't matter.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.026
Brother Duvalier is
responsible for this.

25:09.793 --> 25:12.665
- You're sure?
- Sure enough.

25:23.867 --> 25:25.959
Can I help you, Detective Murdoch?

25:36.004 --> 25:38.229
Stop right there!

25:39.411 --> 25:42.303
Out. What are you doing?

25:43.091 --> 25:45.496
John Duvalier, I'm
placing you under arrest

25:45.512 --> 25:47.476
for the murder of Wesley Seaver.

25:58.036 --> 25:59.738
I did nothing wrong.

25:59.751 --> 26:02.287
Nothing more than I've
done my entire life.

26:02.313 --> 26:05.100
You may not have intended
for Wesley Seaver to die,

26:05.139 --> 26:07.721
but the beating you
administered did cause his death.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.404
After his discipline, he
was alive and well enough

26:10.405 --> 26:12.898
to leave my office with
a smirk on his face.

26:12.999 --> 26:15.264
A photograph doesn't lie.

26:15.323 --> 26:19.003
You hit the boy over
and over and over...

26:19.049 --> 26:22.743
- I hit him six times. No more.
- Where's Paul Smith?

26:22.776 --> 26:25.344
- Is he still alive?
- How would I know? He ran away.

26:25.364 --> 26:28.714
He wrote me a letter stating
that you killed Wesley Seaver.

26:29.104 --> 26:31.217
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

26:31.318 --> 26:32.868
So the boy is a liar?

26:32.869 --> 26:35.662
I suppose he is. I
certainly didn't harm him.

26:36.082 --> 26:38.390
What's your association to Hiram Taylor?

26:38.415 --> 26:39.777
I don't know who you're talking about.

26:39.801 --> 26:41.930
We found a shovel with
your fingermarks on it.

26:41.937 --> 26:43.915
Did you use that to bury Wesley Seaver?

26:43.955 --> 26:46.484
I haven't picked up a shovel
in years. I injured my back.

26:46.533 --> 26:49.494
But you're still strong enough
to beat boys half to death.

26:49.547 --> 26:53.811
- I've seen it myself. Felt it myself.
- I don't beat boys.

26:53.844 --> 26:56.926
I exert a rational and
controlled discipline.

26:57.169 --> 26:58.936
You haven't changed a bit.

26:58.963 --> 27:03.096
You misbehave, you get six
strokes. Never more, never less.

27:03.116 --> 27:06.237
That's not true. Look. Look!

27:06.500 --> 27:09.889
- Over twenty strokes!
- Not by my hand.

27:10.383 --> 27:12.296
You murdered him.

27:14.267 --> 27:18.223
I disciplined Wesley.
I did not kill him.

27:18.269 --> 27:20.207
You'll hang for this.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.947
You can't prove

27:23.270 --> 27:25.267
what didn't happen.

27:36.748 --> 27:39.785
I heard you suspect Brother
Duvalier of the murder.

27:40.083 --> 27:42.652
I know him to be a violent man, Julia.

27:42.777 --> 27:44.709
And you've confronted him?

27:45.123 --> 27:48.192
I've interviewed him. He denies it.

27:48.317 --> 27:51.096
He knows that the
evidence isn't irrefutable.

27:51.569 --> 27:53.899
Yet I believe him to be a child killer.

27:54.308 --> 27:57.200
Anger won't put Duvalier
behind bars, William.

27:57.608 --> 28:00.229
We have to dig deeper.
What do you have so far?

28:00.282 --> 28:02.141
Just my conviction that he did it.

28:02.242 --> 28:04.310
Every crime has an author, William.

28:04.546 --> 28:06.545
You need to find the signature.

28:12.052 --> 28:14.153
How long have you worked
here at the Orphanage?

28:14.183 --> 28:15.435
Since it opened.

28:17.117 --> 28:19.592
Have you ever seen
Duvalier use a shovel?

28:19.693 --> 28:21.149
Not a once.

28:21.159 --> 28:24.004
He's always complained
about some pain in his back.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.599
What's this sawdust from?

28:35.878 --> 28:37.319
I don't know.

28:37.555 --> 28:39.295
You don't know.

28:50.624 --> 28:52.483
This was used recently.

28:52.608 --> 28:53.955
Not by me.

28:54.528 --> 28:56.215
Then by whom?

28:58.696 --> 29:00.394
Excuse me.

29:11.643 --> 29:14.046
"Every crime has an author."

29:14.529 --> 29:16.658
That is very good.

29:16.710 --> 29:18.198
Thank you.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.737
It's certainly catchier than
anything your husband's written.

29:20.805 --> 29:23.912
- I'd rather you not tell him that.
- Oh, no, no, no,

29:23.928 --> 29:25.757
it will be quite apparent.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.966
Well, I suppose I
should go on my rounds.

29:28.982 --> 29:30.707
Healing the sick and all that.

29:30.730 --> 29:32.920
- I probably should as well.
- Oh!

29:33.045 --> 29:35.559
Did I tell you? I
remembered my nom de plume.

29:35.606 --> 29:37.057
Oh, you did not.

29:37.073 --> 29:40.116
- Eliza Ladywood.
- Oh! Oh!

29:40.347 --> 29:42.166
Oh, that was a little clumsy.

29:45.477 --> 29:48.027
- You're Eliza Ladywood?
- Mm-hmm.

29:48.064 --> 29:50.713
Author of <i>Adventures</i>
<i>of A Young Woman Abroad?</i>

29:50.724 --> 29:55.054
Uh, I suppose. Did she
spend time with a cowboy?

29:55.155 --> 29:56.332
Yes.

29:56.674 --> 29:59.481
- Yes, she did.
- Then I guess that's my book.

29:59.523 --> 30:01.467
I wonder why they changed the title.

30:01.709 --> 30:04.329
Although, I'm not really Eliza Ladywood.

30:04.354 --> 30:07.199
- There is no Eliza Ladywood.
- Yes, but...

30:07.300 --> 30:09.189
You've heard of her?

30:10.383 --> 30:12.986
It's a book of some notoriety.

30:13.039 --> 30:14.504
Oh!

30:14.972 --> 30:17.438
I mean... I mean to say that I've seen

30:17.444 --> 30:20.081
some of the younger doctors reading it.

30:21.017 --> 30:24.518
Is that so? Do you think I
should tell them that I wrote it?

30:25.107 --> 30:28.597
I should think that would
not be the wisest of ideas.

30:28.807 --> 30:31.623
And I can see why you changed your name.

30:32.034 --> 30:34.369
The assignation with
the Russian composer,

30:34.370 --> 30:35.898
did that actually happen?

30:35.956 --> 30:38.442
Oh, it certainly did.

30:41.113 --> 30:42.877
That must have been quite something.

30:42.905 --> 30:44.550
So you have read the book?

30:45.305 --> 30:48.073
Yes, I've... I've glanced at it.

30:48.582 --> 30:50.643
Well, more than glanced.

30:51.116 --> 30:54.459
I looked at it numerous times
during my first marriage.

30:54.759 --> 30:59.149
- Oh.
- Ruth, I have to say...

30:59.197 --> 31:03.339
Eliza Ladywood has a voracious appetite!

31:03.851 --> 31:08.102
- Well, I may have exaggerated a smidge.
- Oh, I see.

31:08.144 --> 31:10.742
- But just a smidge.
- Oh.

31:10.867 --> 31:16.111
Well, it certainly makes
my venture seem rather tame.

31:16.135 --> 31:18.480
Oh! No, I'm sorry.

31:18.704 --> 31:22.396
My book simply recounts
events in my life.

31:22.609 --> 31:26.385
Yes, that's the thing, so does mine.

31:30.485 --> 31:33.815
It seems the original handle
was removed from this shovel

31:33.831 --> 31:36.664
and replaced with the
handle of this broom.

31:36.689 --> 31:40.149
So it's the broom handle that
has Duvalier's prints on it?

31:40.170 --> 31:41.752
It would appear someone is attempting

31:41.773 --> 31:43.602
to frame Brother
Duvalier for this murder.

31:43.628 --> 31:45.727
Well, there, I believe I can help you.

31:45.790 --> 31:47.971
I've found out Hiram
Taylor was serving time

31:48.008 --> 31:51.105
at the Uxbridge County Jail
on an assault conviction,

31:51.120 --> 31:53.176
but escaped four months ago.

31:53.301 --> 31:55.919
He's the one who sent
us to the boys home,

31:56.044 --> 31:58.706
pointing the finger
directly at Brother Duvalier.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.702
We didn't catch it sooner
because he gave us a false name.

32:05.718 --> 32:07.619
His real name is Hiram Smith.

32:08.003 --> 32:10.989
There he is. Hiram Smith!

32:11.615 --> 32:12.891
Stop!

32:12.992 --> 32:14.426
Oh!

32:17.060 --> 32:19.821
- What have you done with the boy?
- Nothing! I haven't done anything!

32:19.866 --> 32:22.578
Mr. Smith, you're under arrest
for the murder of Wesley Seaver.

32:22.579 --> 32:24.051
Where is Paul?!

32:24.058 --> 32:26.207
- I didn't take him!
- Leave him alone!

32:26.460 --> 32:29.588
Please just... just leave him alone.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.607
Paul?

32:40.821 --> 32:43.024
You got this all wrong.

32:43.081 --> 32:45.016
Did you not give us a false name?

32:45.086 --> 32:47.797
- Yes, but I...
- Because you'd been in prison

32:47.817 --> 32:50.609
in Uxbridge and instead of
serving out your sentence,

32:50.656 --> 32:52.243
you escaped from jail.

32:52.265 --> 32:53.642
Yes, I did that.

32:53.678 --> 32:54.984
You then secured employment

32:54.999 --> 32:57.612
where you would have close
contact with orphan boys.

32:57.628 --> 32:59.325
- It's not like that.
- No?

32:59.688 --> 33:02.406
You killed Wesley Seaver
and kidnapped his friend.

33:02.469 --> 33:05.080
That's the part you've got wrong,
sir. I never killed that boy.

33:05.101 --> 33:07.625
We found you with Paul
Smith in your custody.

33:08.482 --> 33:10.520
I was in jail when his mother died.

33:10.549 --> 33:12.458
When I found out, I came to get him.

33:12.950 --> 33:15.158
Paul Smith is my son!

33:18.997 --> 33:20.683
<i>Yes, he's my father.</i>

33:21.242 --> 33:23.192
He knew they wouldn't let him take me

33:23.224 --> 33:24.812
because he was meant to be in jail.

33:25.014 --> 33:27.651
So I ran away to be with him.

33:28.563 --> 33:30.630
So why send me the letter?

33:31.297 --> 33:33.946
I wanted to try and help
the others in that place.

33:34.215 --> 33:36.636
Brother Duvalier killed Wesley Seaver.

33:37.554 --> 33:38.605
We all knew.

33:39.265 --> 33:41.047
What made you so sure?

33:42.125 --> 33:44.644
It's all right. Just tell the truth.

33:47.148 --> 33:48.795
After the last beating,

33:49.757 --> 33:51.728
Wesley was out for revenge.

33:52.253 --> 33:53.952
What kind of revenge?

33:54.620 --> 33:56.065
I don't know.

33:56.643 --> 34:00.227
But he tried something, and
Duvalier killed him for it.

34:00.418 --> 34:02.329
Why didn't you tell us?

34:03.488 --> 34:06.327
I tried to, you didn't understand.

34:06.805 --> 34:09.308
So I tried to talk to him.

34:10.338 --> 34:12.136
That's why you came to the kitchen?

34:12.199 --> 34:14.841
Yes, but Brother Duvalier was there.

34:15.342 --> 34:17.598
And you were afraid to
speak in front of him?

34:18.245 --> 34:21.052
I saw you and Brother
Duvalier were friends, and

34:21.483 --> 34:23.938
I thought talking to
you wouldn't do any good.

34:24.185 --> 34:26.418
So you took matters into your own hands.

34:27.002 --> 34:30.422
You devised a plan to
lead us to Duvalier.

34:31.851 --> 34:34.655
I wanted to go live
with my father anyway, so

34:35.049 --> 34:38.524
I decided to make it look
like Duvalier killed me.

34:42.503 --> 34:44.471
So you started with the letter.

34:44.827 --> 34:47.107
Yes. Then the wheelbarrow tread.

34:47.965 --> 34:49.442
What about the blood?

34:50.331 --> 34:52.101
It... it was mine.

34:52.226 --> 34:53.884
And the shovel?

34:54.158 --> 34:56.733
I put the Brother's
broom handle onto it.

34:56.786 --> 35:00.156
And hid the re-jigged shovel
out there for us to find.

35:00.454 --> 35:03.617
Ingenious! You almost had us fooled.

35:07.449 --> 35:09.778
We know that Wesley
Seaver died of blood shock

35:09.788 --> 35:11.731
following a severe beating.

35:13.568 --> 35:16.479
Imagine Paul Smith is telling the truth.

35:16.491 --> 35:20.369
Wesley tried to exact some sort
of revenge on Brother Duvalier...

35:20.716 --> 35:23.549
Then he was caught
and disciplined again.

35:24.364 --> 35:28.144
Perhaps Wesley received two
beatings on the day that he died.

35:32.008 --> 35:34.510
If we could only figure out how young

35:34.915 --> 35:37.516
Mr. Seaver planned to exact his revenge,

35:37.532 --> 35:39.693
perhaps we'd be one step closer.

35:42.872 --> 35:44.831
With me, Detective.

35:47.892 --> 35:51.051
Felix, tell us what happened
the day Wesley disappeared.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.437
It was the same kind
of day as any other.

35:55.357 --> 35:57.887
Paul Smith told us that Wesley planned

35:57.895 --> 36:00.247
to get revenge against Brother Duvalier;

36:00.348 --> 36:02.143
is he telling the truth?

36:02.458 --> 36:03.841
Yes.

36:04.085 --> 36:06.996
Did Wesley tell you
what he planned to do?

36:07.421 --> 36:08.722
No.

36:09.455 --> 36:12.125
Are you absolutely certain, Felix?

36:13.124 --> 36:14.394
Well...

36:14.495 --> 36:16.373
the only thing was

36:16.446 --> 36:18.785
that night I was doing kitchen duty,

36:19.122 --> 36:21.901
but Wesley came in and told
me he wanted to take over.

36:22.612 --> 36:24.426
And he wouldn't tell me why.

36:24.931 --> 36:27.838
I thought it was strange, but
he said I should just leave.

36:28.476 --> 36:29.809
So I did.

36:30.592 --> 36:33.626
That's very helpful, Felix. Thank you.

36:34.298 --> 36:36.186
You're a 12-year-old boy,

36:36.311 --> 36:38.518
you're plotting your revenge,

36:38.619 --> 36:40.218
you're in the kitchen;

36:40.727 --> 36:42.115
what do you do?

36:43.487 --> 36:48.174
We know that Brother Duvalier came
in most nights to fix his own tea.

36:49.167 --> 36:51.943
I lie in wait for him.

36:59.644 --> 37:01.689
Perhaps something more subtle.

37:01.863 --> 37:03.340
You're planning revenge,

37:03.377 --> 37:05.242
it has to appear as
though it were an accident.

37:05.279 --> 37:07.914
You've already been
beaten once, why risk it?

37:08.707 --> 37:11.167
You said Brother Duvalier liked his tea?

37:11.209 --> 37:14.011
- Yes.
- All right.

37:21.093 --> 37:22.495
This is odd.

37:24.165 --> 37:25.667
What's that?

37:26.434 --> 37:28.784
Oh, wait.

37:29.057 --> 37:31.318
Perhaps not so odd.

37:31.339 --> 37:34.257
Young Wesley had this in his pocket.

37:38.621 --> 37:40.561
He tampered with the handle.

37:40.887 --> 37:44.230
Brother Duvalier picks up
the kettle once it's hot...

37:44.282 --> 37:46.364
The handle comes apart...

37:46.396 --> 37:49.250
And Brother Duvalier is
scalded with hot water.

37:49.681 --> 37:51.847
You said the boy was hit repeatedly?

37:51.894 --> 37:54.948
- Yes.
- What if that happened here?

37:55.663 --> 37:57.182
I'm Brother Duvalier,

37:57.203 --> 38:00.431
I've just been scalded
by a disobedient child...

38:00.434 --> 38:02.113
One he can't control.

38:02.144 --> 38:03.784
I grab the first thing I see,

38:03.795 --> 38:06.670
and I start whaling away. Ahem!

38:14.460 --> 38:17.114
I should have noticed this earlier.

38:18.534 --> 38:20.320
Here, have a look.

38:20.421 --> 38:22.765
Two distinct similar marks.

38:24.158 --> 38:26.059
He was beaten with this.

38:26.508 --> 38:28.605
Shall we go speak to Brother Duvalier?

38:28.629 --> 38:31.531
Or would you prefer to do that alone?

38:33.501 --> 38:34.901
Neither.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.947
Wesley was out for
revenge for the beating

38:41.976 --> 38:44.870
he'd received earlier that
day from Brother Duvalier.

38:46.137 --> 38:49.191
Only Brother Duvalier
wasn't feeling well.

38:50.311 --> 38:52.687
You made him his tea that night.

38:55.137 --> 38:56.998
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:57.024 --> 38:59.459
You picked up the rigged
kettle and were scalded.

38:59.827 --> 39:01.346
Care to lift your shirt?

39:01.603 --> 39:03.454
I'm sure the burns remain.

39:05.972 --> 39:08.768
- Did you intend to kill him?
- Of course I didn't.

39:09.367 --> 39:10.904
It was only discipline.

39:11.455 --> 39:14.036
You were burned, angry;

39:14.575 --> 39:16.412
how many times did you hit him?

39:17.674 --> 39:19.104
Six.

39:19.708 --> 39:21.270
Six is correct.

39:22.405 --> 39:24.618
You weren't correct in this moment.

39:24.743 --> 39:26.421
You were in a rage.

39:29.408 --> 39:30.885
Yes.

39:31.578 --> 39:33.818
Did he attempt to run away?

39:35.663 --> 39:37.214
He wasn't moving.

39:39.099 --> 39:41.299
What exactly did you do next?

39:41.802 --> 39:44.190
I went to get salve for my burn.

39:45.272 --> 39:46.981
It hurt badly.

39:49.394 --> 39:51.123
And when I came back...

39:51.423 --> 39:52.921
He was dead.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.562
I didn't mean to do it.

40:00.059 --> 40:03.523
And then you continued to
make Brother Duvalier his tea.

40:04.316 --> 40:06.125
He has to have his tea.

40:11.413 --> 40:13.790
Will Mister Hornby hang?

40:14.268 --> 40:17.564
No. I will be petitioning for leniency.

40:17.859 --> 40:21.374
I don't believe him to be fully
responsible for his actions.

40:21.475 --> 40:23.116
What are you suggesting?

40:24.335 --> 40:27.146
Mister Hornby was your
ward all of his life.

40:27.248 --> 40:30.544
You raised him with
violence, he acted in kind.

40:30.575 --> 40:32.273
I raised him well.

40:32.321 --> 40:34.787
You're deluding yourself
if you believe that.

40:35.117 --> 40:37.624
Say what you will, William,

40:37.725 --> 40:40.953
but I've done far more good
in this world than harm.

40:41.642 --> 40:45.298
You will no longer be responsible
for the welfare of children.

40:45.598 --> 40:47.801
You have no power to close my Home.

40:47.835 --> 40:49.877
It's not my intention to close it.

40:50.455 --> 40:53.506
- Only that you resign.
- I won't do that.

40:54.582 --> 40:58.821
Wesley Seaver died from the
cumulative impact of two beatings,

40:58.946 --> 41:00.655
so strictly speaking,

41:00.695 --> 41:03.691
you could also be held
culpable for his death.

41:06.351 --> 41:08.060
You would charge me?

41:08.185 --> 41:12.170
Unless you resign, I
will see you behind bars.

41:13.395 --> 41:14.846
Tell me, William,

41:15.314 --> 41:17.411
do you really believe

41:17.848 --> 41:20.650
that any person who follows in my place

41:21.001 --> 41:23.405
will run things differently?

41:25.434 --> 41:26.890
I would hope so.

41:27.468 --> 41:28.951
Then ask yourself...

41:30.764 --> 41:33.330
would you have become the man you are

41:33.881 --> 41:35.811
if it weren't for me?

41:46.686 --> 41:50.486
I enjoyed this book tremendously.
I think you will too.

41:50.907 --> 41:52.384
And...

41:52.636 --> 41:55.186
this is also by Jules Verne,

41:55.217 --> 41:57.820
but it's not yet been
translated into English.

41:57.841 --> 41:59.381
Do you know any French?

41:59.591 --> 42:02.777
- A little bit.
- Well, see how you get on with it.

42:02.814 --> 42:05.506
The illustrations are exceptional!

42:06.463 --> 42:10.215
And I'll bring you more books
when you're done with these.

42:12.340 --> 42:14.475
Why are you being so nice to me?

42:15.955 --> 42:17.406
Well...

42:18.852 --> 42:22.027
- I was an orphan too.
- And...

42:22.700 --> 42:25.801
- and now you're a police detective?
- I am.

42:25.854 --> 42:28.167
As you could be one day.

42:28.362 --> 42:30.558
Or anything you want to be.

42:30.932 --> 42:32.903
No.

42:33.428 --> 42:34.962
You certainly can.

42:35.625 --> 42:39.466
Where we start out in this world
needn't define where we end up.

42:50.976 --> 42:52.757
Are you all right, William?

42:53.582 --> 42:55.790
At one time, that man

42:55.832 --> 42:57.619
was important to me.

42:58.039 --> 42:59.595
You did the right thing.

43:00.390 --> 43:02.103
His methods were wrong.

43:03.082 --> 43:05.389
I've seen that firsthand.

43:06.704 --> 43:08.495
And you've stopped him.

43:14.362 --> 43:15.812
Julia,

43:16.149 --> 43:18.172
are you reading this?

43:18.184 --> 43:19.856
I am.

43:21.042 --> 43:22.676
Why?

43:22.994 --> 43:24.982
For inspiration.

43:25.823 --> 43:28.262
Not for our book certainly...

43:28.667 --> 43:32.163
Well, not for this one,

43:32.652 --> 43:34.979
but perhaps the next...

43:37.818 --> 43:40.562

- Julia...
