WEBVTT

00:54.471 --> 00:57.432
You must be my lucky star

00:57.516 --> 01:01.687
'Cause you shine on me
Wherever you are

01:01.770 --> 01:05.941
I just think of you
And I start to glow

01:06.024 --> 01:10.237
And I need your light
And baby you know

01:10.320 --> 01:13.866
-Uh-huh. And look to camera.
-Starlight, starbright…

01:13.949 --> 01:15.242
Work it and work it.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.787
Lucky leprechaun coming in for the chorus.

01:18.871 --> 01:22.916
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight

01:23.000 --> 01:27.171
And hup, and hup, and double to the left.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.547
You got it!

01:31.049 --> 01:33.927
Oh, my goodness.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.262
Cut.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.265
You sure have bad luck, Sam Greenfield.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.808
Who, me?

01:41.560 --> 01:42.603
Sorry, Sam.

01:42.686 --> 01:46.106
Before we go again,
we gotta get you some good luck.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.566
Come on.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.253
Maybe one of these will help.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.674
I see you've added to your collection.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.968
-Yep. My lucky crane…
-Nice.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.470
…lucky German pig.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.640
My Japanese waving cat.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.767
-That one's super lucky.
-Cool.

02:21.850 --> 02:27.022
My doll horse from Sweden.
I put all my good luck charms together

02:27.105 --> 02:30.359
so that my weekend visit
will go just right.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.528
Smart thinking.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.489
-They're picking you up on Friday, right?
-Yep.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.117
And I see you've got
your lucky penny spot ready to go.

02:39.201 --> 02:42.120
Yeah! It's the last one I need.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.081
Find a penny, pick it up…

02:44.164 --> 02:47.084
and all day long, you'll have good luck.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.920
Let's go finish the video.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.549
-Let's do it.
-Sam? There you are.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.425
The social worker's waiting for you.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.514
Bye, Sam. Good luck!

03:00.597 --> 03:01.807
Where's she going?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.392
She's aging out.

03:03.475 --> 03:06.144
Well,
we're all gonna miss you around here.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.982
What if I just stayed a couple more days?

03:10.065 --> 03:13.694
-Sam, we talked about this, and--
-I know.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.071
I just thought, for Hazel's sake,

03:16.154 --> 03:19.283
maybe I could stick around here
a bit longer, see her off for her visit.

03:19.366 --> 03:23.078
If it were up to me, yes,
but you're 18 now.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.372
-This is how it works.
-Just two more days.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.584
I know you're nervous,
but you're moving into your own place.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.002
It is gonna be great.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.132
And you can come back
Friday for visiting hours,

03:35.215 --> 03:36.717
see Hazel before she goes.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.636
Yeah, okay.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.722
I'll see you downstairs.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.819
Not sure I'm ready for this.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.411
I love hugs.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.787
I know.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.834
Don't think my leaving means
we won't finish that video.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.504
In the meantime,
I'll keep practicing those dance moves.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.798
I'll see you Friday before your visit.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.884
And if you find a lucky penny?

04:18.966 --> 04:20.260
I'll bring it for sure.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.056
Hi, Samantha. Big day.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.558
Those are your records.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.644
My life in a box.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.483
-All set?
-All set.

05:29.872 --> 05:33.375
I guess we weren't lucky
enough to find you that forever family.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.502
Yeah, sure missed the boat on that one.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.506
On the upside,
now I can put all that hoping behind me.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.009
Well, I hope you like your new place.

05:42.092 --> 05:45.512
You have to be in school or working
full-time to keep the apartment.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.931
I started my online classes last week,

05:48.015 --> 05:50.559
and I start my new job
tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

05:50.642 --> 05:51.685
Excellent.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.315
I suppose you'll be needing these.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.691
Thank you.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.242
I guess that's why Ms. Rivera suggested
I bring a spare.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.745
This is probably safer.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.082
So, will you be checking in
on me weekly, or…

06:14.708 --> 06:16.877
Someone from the agency
will call you next month,

06:16.960 --> 06:19.630
but otherwise you are
officially on your own.

06:21.924 --> 06:22.925
Thanks.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.511
Good luck.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.480
"Don't be late."

08:40.979 --> 08:43.607
Okay, universe, think you're pretty tough?

08:56.912 --> 08:58.372
Take that, universe.

09:02.835 --> 09:05.254
Thanks, Bill.
Did you remember to water the daffodils?

09:05.337 --> 09:06.547
And if you could,

09:06.630 --> 09:09.216
unbox the unicorn night-lights
and restock the birthday balloons.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.426
Lastly, I promise you this is it.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.804
Go to the bathrooms and give it
a once-over before we open.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.722
Just keep making my store look pretty.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.350
Good morning, Mr. Hammond-- Harmon.

09:18.433 --> 09:22.145
Sam! Right on time. I love that.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.398
I hope you're taking notes, Bill.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.817
And, please, just call me Marv.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.318
Marv, got it.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.696
You may be the best decision I ever made.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.086
Hi, Marv.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.130
Hey, Sam, you never mentioned that…

09:48.547 --> 09:50.632
you had circus skills on your résumé.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.634
Unless I read past that or something.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.556
Sorry to bother you.

09:57.973 --> 09:58.974
How did it get on your--

10:01.351 --> 10:02.561
You know something?

10:03.061 --> 10:05.939
Don't sweat it.
I got the perfect task for you.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.943
Here we go, Sam.
A job you can do outside.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.528
Cart patrol.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.946
Yay!

10:13.530 --> 10:16.074
You'll have better luck tomorrow.
I'm sure of it.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.118
I keep hoping, Marv.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.289
I'm really glad you're here.

10:22.372 --> 10:25.459
-Did something happen?
-Her weekend visit just got canceled.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.919
Oh, no.

10:27.002 --> 10:30.214
Yeah, she was waiting on the porch
when they called.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.632
Did they reschedule?

10:31.715 --> 10:37.095
No, but there's a couple who wants to come
for a first visit on Sunday afternoon.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.857
Hey, you.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.901
They're not coming.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.154
I know. I'm so sorry, Hazel.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.908
What if I never find a forever family?

10:58.534 --> 11:00.577
This was just a little bad luck.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.828
Of course you will.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.830
You didn't.

11:04.957 --> 11:08.085
Yeah, but you're not me.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.671
You're the lucky leprechaun, remember?

11:11.338 --> 11:15.592
You always find the pot of gold,
and this will be no different.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.761
You'll find your forever family too.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.638
Who knows?

11:19.721 --> 11:22.057
Maybe the couple coming on Sunday.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.433
Maybe it'll be them.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.186
Yeah, maybe.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.439
And maybe you'll find me
a lucky penny before then.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.914
Beat it, cat. Take your bad luck with ya.

12:21.283 --> 12:24.286
And now it's a table for two.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.877
Why couldn't it have just worked out?

12:35.839 --> 12:37.549
Sorry, I didn't tell you the first part.

12:38.342 --> 12:42.971
My friend Hazel could have been
one step closer to getting adopted today,

12:43.555 --> 12:45.140
but it didn't happen.

12:45.224 --> 12:46.808
Her weekend visit got canceled,

12:48.227 --> 12:51.396
which probably doesn't sound
like a big deal,

12:51.480 --> 12:53.232
but believe me, it is.

12:54.358 --> 12:58.070
You only get so many chances
to find a forever family,

12:58.153 --> 13:00.614
and the older you get, the harder it is.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.909
She's meeting a new couple on Sunday.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.912
If I could just give her
a little good luck…

13:07.704 --> 13:10.832
But you can't give someone
something you've never had.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.836
Still, if I could,

13:14.837 --> 13:18.298
and if good luck was something
you could actually hold in your hand,

13:18.382 --> 13:20.217
I'd give it all to Hazel.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.719
So that maybe she could find
her forever family

13:22.803 --> 13:25.764
and not end up alone like me,

13:25.848 --> 13:28.016
sitting on a curb,

13:28.100 --> 13:29.726
talking to a cat.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.191
You're welcome!

13:40.779 --> 13:43.115
Well, what do you know, Hazel.

13:45.492 --> 13:50.247
Find a penny, pick it up,
and all day long, you'll have good luck.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.148
Lucky pennies are real.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.279
Ms. Rivera, hi.
Is it okay if I stop by after work later?

15:45.362 --> 15:48.365
I have something special
for Hazel for her visit tomorrow.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.449
Great.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.411
And please don't tell her.
I want it to be a surprise.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.500
Yes!

16:01.378 --> 16:03.172
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

16:06.884 --> 16:08.177
Hi, Marv.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.320
Well, somebody found their groove.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.697
No cart patrol for you tomorrow.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.158
I got a pallet of glassware
with your name on it.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.118
-Sounds great.
-Have a nice night.

16:33.202 --> 16:36.622
Thanks. I will.
I'm off to surprise my friend Hazel.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.730
My stupid bad luck.

17:46.900 --> 17:47.943
You're back.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.906
So, remember I told you
I wanted good luck for my friend Hazel

17:52.990 --> 17:54.241
for her visit tomorrow?

17:54.324 --> 17:55.659
Well, guess what?

17:55.742 --> 17:58.579
After you left last night, I found some.

17:58.662 --> 18:02.791
That's right.
I found an actual lucky penny.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.711
And what did I do?
I flushed it down the toilet.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.212
You did what?

18:07.296 --> 18:09.590
You flushed my penny down the toilet?

18:09.673 --> 18:11.508
What did you do that for?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.553
You just talked.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.809
It was you.

18:21.852 --> 18:23.937
You gave me that lucky penny.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.191
Please, I just need one more.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.650
Wait!

18:28.734 --> 18:30.652
Wait! Come back!

19:31.839 --> 19:32.840
Huh?

20:07.416 --> 20:10.377
I just need a penny for my friend Hazel.

20:26.185 --> 20:27.769
Huh?

21:00.594 --> 21:04.056
How was my day? It was lovely!
Thank you. Just brilliant.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.642
Lost my travel penny
and was chased across the city

21:06.725 --> 21:09.061
by an unrelenting human zombie.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.232
Always with the obnoxiously long password.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.400
Got it.

21:46.223 --> 21:49.560
Now, about that penny problem.
Why you talking to yourself, Bob?

21:49.893 --> 21:53.063
Just practicing so when I'm banished
forever, I'll have someone to talk to--

21:55.232 --> 21:56.942
No.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.697
What manner of crazy human are you?

22:01.780 --> 22:04.283
What kind of a crazy talking cat are you?

22:04.366 --> 22:06.076
A lucky Scottish one, obviously.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.870
But black cats aren't lucky.

22:08.287 --> 22:11.999
In Scotland, black cats are considered
very lucky, thank you very much.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.750
-Is this Scotland?
-No!

22:13.834 --> 22:16.420
And humans cannot be here.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.423
-Where's "here"?
-You need to leave. Now.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.884
I'll leave, no problem,

22:21.967 --> 22:24.094
as soon as you give me
another lucky penny.

22:24.178 --> 22:26.346
I did not give you a penny.

22:26.930 --> 22:31.018
It fell out of my collar when you lured me
over with that tasty meat bread.

22:31.101 --> 22:32.561
It's called a panini.

22:32.644 --> 22:36.523
Whatever. It was all just a ploy
to steal my travel penny.

22:36.607 --> 22:37.608
Travel penny?

22:37.691 --> 22:40.652
We creatures from the Land of Luck
aren't lucky in your world,

22:40.736 --> 22:42.654
so we carry some with us just to be safe.

22:42.738 --> 22:45.407
Did you just say, "Land of Luck"?

22:46.408 --> 22:47.659
Hide!

22:50.162 --> 22:52.414
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.834
Welcome back, Bob. Arrived back
18 hundred hours and six minutes.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.628
Leprechauns?

22:57.711 --> 22:59.755
Anything unusual happen on the other side?

22:59.838 --> 23:00.839
Nope.

23:06.637 --> 23:09.139
I see you located one blocked luck line.

23:09.223 --> 23:10.974
That construction site. No wonder.

23:11.058 --> 23:15.187
Yep, looks like Paulie's popcorn pop-up
is putting down roots.

23:15.938 --> 23:18.815
Not a problem.
Two ticks and around she goes.

23:18.899 --> 23:21.360
I'd wager three might do the trick.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.780
Right you are, Quinn.

23:24.863 --> 23:27.115
Luck flowing freely once again.

23:27.199 --> 23:30.994
Say, you guys seen Gerry around?
He's usually here to check me in.

23:31.411 --> 23:34.331
He's down at the Penny Depot.
They needed an extra hand.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.415
Penny Depot?

23:35.499 --> 23:37.334
So we're covering his line cat returns.

23:37.918 --> 23:41.421
And Gerry said he always turns in
your travel penny for ya,

23:41.505 --> 23:43.048
so we'll be taking that now.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.383
Uh-oh.

23:44.466 --> 23:47.719
You know what,
I'll just turn it in myself today.

23:48.095 --> 23:50.305
If you say so, Bob. Good luck with that.

23:50.389 --> 23:54.393
Yeah. Say hi to the Captain for us.
We know how much she loves you.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.853
But she doesn't love him.

23:55.936 --> 23:57.896
-I was being ironical.
-You're so clever.

23:57.980 --> 23:59.189
What have I done?

23:59.273 --> 24:01.275
I wasn't supposed to stop
and eat human food.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.735
I definitely wasn't supposed to talk
in front of a human.

24:03.819 --> 24:07.573
And I sure as heck wasn't supposed to let
the human who lost my travel penny

24:07.656 --> 24:09.283
follow me through the portal!

24:09.366 --> 24:13.620
Okay, but those leprechauns just said
something about a Penny Depot.

24:13.704 --> 24:15.038
Maybe we could get one there.

24:15.122 --> 24:19.418
Only leprechauns are allowed inside,
and you are not a leprechaun!

24:20.002 --> 24:21.503
But maybe I could be.

24:21.587 --> 24:22.588
What?

24:22.671 --> 24:25.632
You think you're just gonna march
down to the leprechaun locker room

24:25.716 --> 24:27.384
and borrow some clothes?

24:27.467 --> 24:30.262
-Brilliant idea. Let's go.
-No, wait. Stop!

24:30.846 --> 24:31.972
Just stop!

24:32.055 --> 24:35.100
Hey, Bob. Everything okay?

24:35.184 --> 24:38.103
Aye, just stretching my legs.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.730
Okeydokey.

24:41.148 --> 24:45.527
Even if you could masquerade as
some freakishly big leprechaun,

24:45.611 --> 24:48.906
I can't get past the Captain
without turning in a penny.

24:48.989 --> 24:51.366
What if you turned in this?

24:51.450 --> 24:53.744
This is a button.

24:53.827 --> 24:56.205
And at some point, they will discover it,

24:56.288 --> 25:00.959
and if I don't have a lucky penny in hand
when they do, I'll be banished.

25:01.043 --> 25:04.963
Okay,
but maybe the button buys us a little time

25:05.047 --> 25:07.466
until we get a lucky penny
from the Penny Depot.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.093
-Then I'll borrow it for my frie--
-For your friend Hazel.

25:10.177 --> 25:11.887
Yes, I've got that part.

25:12.554 --> 25:15.182
What? You said it, like, a hundred times.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.060
We'll go to the Penny Depot
to get one penny.

25:18.143 --> 25:20.771
I use it first, and then it's all yours.

25:22.564 --> 25:23.857
And then I'll leave.

25:25.484 --> 25:27.694
You'll never see my face again.

25:30.322 --> 25:32.407
Great. I'm Sam, by the way.

25:32.491 --> 25:35.827
This is strictly business.
Names are unimportant.

25:35.911 --> 25:38.997
But I already heard them call you Bob.

25:39.373 --> 25:40.958
Fine. Yes, it's Bob.

25:43.252 --> 25:46.547
Welcome back, line cats.
Now, drop your pennies and move along.

25:46.630 --> 25:48.298
That's it. Let's go, kitty cats.

25:48.382 --> 25:49.883
Drop your travel pennies.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.303
Keep it moving.

25:54.179 --> 25:56.306
Sector 64 today, Joanie.

25:56.390 --> 25:57.641
Nigeria.

26:01.353 --> 26:03.188
Catch you on the flip side, Cap.

26:03.272 --> 26:06.483
-That's the Captain?
-Aye, that's her.

26:06.567 --> 26:08.443
She really doesn't like me.

26:08.527 --> 26:10.571
Maybe she's not a cat person.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.781
Well, she likes the other cats just fine.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.033
So, what's the plan?

26:15.117 --> 26:18.912
Right. You sneak out that door over there.
I'll keep the Captain busy.

26:18.996 --> 26:21.915
When you're clear, I'll drop in the button
and meet you on the other side.

26:21.999 --> 26:24.293
Simple. Good luck to us both.

26:28.297 --> 26:30.674
The sweet clankety-clack of lucky pennies.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.843
There's no better sound in the world.

26:33.552 --> 26:35.929
Bob, what are you waiting for?
Drop your penny.

26:36.013 --> 26:37.514
Aye, I got it right here, Cap.

26:37.598 --> 26:39.975
But first, how's your day been so far?

26:40.058 --> 26:41.685
Okay, Bob, what are you up to?

26:42.311 --> 26:45.314
Why can't a cat ask
how his boss's day is going?

26:45.397 --> 26:46.982
Because it's weird, Bob.

26:47.065 --> 26:50.110
Because you never have asked me
anything, Bob.

26:50.194 --> 26:52.321
Because we don't even like
each other, Bob.

26:52.404 --> 26:57.868
Because you give me the heebie-jeebies,
and you always have, Bob.

26:58.202 --> 27:00.871
Is that all? All righty then.

27:01.455 --> 27:03.957
Say, Captain, do you like jokes?

27:04.708 --> 27:06.168
Only the funny ones, Bob.

27:06.752 --> 27:09.421
Right. Well, then you'll love this one.

27:09.505 --> 27:11.256
Why did the penny arrest the nickel?

27:12.090 --> 27:14.384
I don't know, Bob. Why?

27:14.468 --> 27:16.553
Because she was a copper.

27:24.478 --> 27:25.479
Wasn't funny.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.272
Yeah, not my best.

27:27.356 --> 27:31.151
-Catch you later, Cap.
-Not if I catch you first, Bob.

27:31.235 --> 27:33.403
Leprechaun locker room, here we come.

27:33.487 --> 27:35.614
Welcome back, Shirley. Keep it moving.

27:36.406 --> 27:38.992
Not to pry, but do you have fingers?

27:39.076 --> 27:41.703
Thumbs. I'm polydactyl.

27:44.081 --> 27:46.124
"Gerry." That's your friend, right?

27:46.208 --> 27:48.043
He's more like my assistant.

27:48.126 --> 27:49.795
You sure he won't mind?

27:50.170 --> 27:51.338
Gerry never minds.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.340
And enough with the questions.

27:53.423 --> 27:56.718
Strictly business, remember?
We don't need to get to know each other.

27:56.802 --> 27:58.053
Yeah, okay.

27:58.136 --> 28:00.389
Then he says, "Are you a River dancer?"

28:00.472 --> 28:02.140
We forgot to check the lavvy.

28:02.224 --> 28:03.684
Hurry, before somebody sees.

28:03.767 --> 28:07.229
-And then he did a little jig.
-A jig? No. You have to show--

28:07.312 --> 28:08.939
Good afternoon, ladies.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.233
What are you doing in here, Bob?

28:11.316 --> 28:14.152
Aye, line cats have their own locker room.

28:14.236 --> 28:17.656
I was just-- Well, I was--

28:17.739 --> 28:19.700
-You know--
-He was helping me.

28:20.784 --> 28:24.288
He's my Land of Luck
leprechaun orientation guide.

28:25.205 --> 28:28.333
-Deary me, you're a big lass.
-Aye.

28:29.084 --> 28:30.669
I'm Sam.

28:30.752 --> 28:31.879
Where ya from?

28:33.046 --> 28:36.175
She's from-- You know--

28:37.551 --> 28:40.345
Latvia! That's right. She's from Latvia.

28:44.558 --> 28:48.645
Hey, Saoirse, didn't Clodagh say she met
a Latvian guy down at the Hairy Lemon,

28:48.729 --> 28:50.564
and that he was a real big fella too?

28:50.647 --> 28:51.899
Aye, she did.

28:51.982 --> 28:55.444
Well, cheers to Latvia
for growing 'em big.

28:56.069 --> 28:59.281
Guess not all lucky creatures are
teeny-toaty like us, eh?

29:01.658 --> 29:03.994
-Nice meeting you.
-Enjoy the rest of your tour.

29:04.077 --> 29:07.289
-Don't do anything we wouldn't do.
-You're shameless.

29:07.372 --> 29:09.333
They were so sweet and tiny.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.127
And surprisingly less clever than usual.

29:12.544 --> 29:13.921
They totally bought it.

29:14.004 --> 29:15.380
Next stop, lucky penny.

29:15.464 --> 29:17.424
-Right.
-And then, you leave.

29:17.508 --> 29:18.800
-Right.
-Say it with me.

29:18.884 --> 29:21.553
-And then you leave.
-No, you leave.

29:21.637 --> 29:23.805
Yeah, I know. It was a joke.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.816
Welcome to the Land of Luck.

29:37.903 --> 29:39.112
Incredible.

29:45.118 --> 29:46.370
Hey, there.

29:55.295 --> 29:56.338
Uh-huh.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.390
Morning.

30:06.473 --> 30:09.643
This way.
We'll be at the Penny Depot in no time.

30:09.726 --> 30:12.688
-Follow me right onto the disc.
-Okay.

30:12.771 --> 30:14.398
Here we go.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.275
Just smile and wave.

30:16.775 --> 30:19.653
-Hey, Bob. Lunch this week?
-Aye, let's do it.

30:20.153 --> 30:21.488
Okay, it's transfer time.

30:31.331 --> 30:33.208
-Morning, Bob.
-Hi, Betty.

30:33.292 --> 30:36.545
So far, so good, Sam.
No one's even noticed ya.

30:37.713 --> 30:39.923
Sam?

30:42.134 --> 30:43.135
Sam!

30:45.470 --> 30:48.182
You hear about Joe?
He just joined the luck makers' union.

30:48.265 --> 30:50.517
That's great. He's hilarious.

31:12.247 --> 31:14.833
Just how unlucky are you?

31:14.917 --> 31:18.003
Yeah, super-duper unlucky.

31:18.086 --> 31:21.423
Well, I wish you would have made that
clear before we shook on our little deal.

31:22.007 --> 31:24.510
Hi, guys. Hi, there.

31:24.593 --> 31:26.720
Just checking on the rail grips.

31:27.763 --> 31:29.640
There is no unlucky here.

31:30.766 --> 31:34.561
So if you want that lucky penny for your
wee friend, you best start blending in.

31:35.062 --> 31:36.939
That's what I was trying to do.

31:38.315 --> 31:40.275
Well, that was your first mistake.

31:40.359 --> 31:42.528
Lucky creatures don't try.

31:42.611 --> 31:43.779
They don't have to.

31:43.862 --> 31:46.490
And stop sweating.
They don't do that either.

31:46.573 --> 31:47.908
Right, okay.

31:47.991 --> 31:49.785
-I'll try my best.
-Uh-uh.

31:49.868 --> 31:53.121
I mean,
I'll try to act like I'm not trying.

31:53.997 --> 31:55.290
Good answer.

31:58.043 --> 31:59.461
We've got to find Gerry.

31:59.545 --> 32:02.214
He'll know
how all this penny business works.

32:02.297 --> 32:04.299
He'll be the super cheery one in green.

32:06.343 --> 32:08.011
They all look like that.

32:08.804 --> 32:11.557
Slainte, friends. What is the story?

32:11.640 --> 32:13.016
There he is.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.601
O'Neill!

32:16.478 --> 32:17.980
O'Reilly, O'Donoghue.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.399
Barry.

32:23.527 --> 32:25.279
And I didn't forget you, Clarisse.

32:25.362 --> 32:28.073
-I've got your microbrew right here.
-Thanks, Gerry!

32:28.156 --> 32:30.701
-Is he thoughtful or what?
-Gerry!

32:33.537 --> 32:35.247
Sam, Gerry.

32:35.664 --> 32:36.915
You're grand.

32:38.834 --> 32:40.878
Are those my clothes?

32:40.961 --> 32:43.422
Sorry, Bob said you wouldn't mind.

32:43.505 --> 32:46.508
Sam's visiting from Latvia. Her
clothes got all messed up on arrival and--

32:47.551 --> 32:49.428
So, you live in the human world?

32:49.511 --> 32:50.596
Usually.

32:50.679 --> 32:54.683
Oh, man!
Have you ever tried grilled cheese?

32:54.766 --> 32:55.976
I have.

32:57.227 --> 33:01.398
Right. So, Ger, as you know,
cats aren't allowed inside the Depot,

33:01.481 --> 33:03.942
and Sam's a wee bit nervous
about her first shift.

33:04.026 --> 33:08.238
So I was thinking maybe you could escort
her in and, you know, show her the ropes.

33:08.322 --> 33:10.782
Lucky me. Of course.

33:10.866 --> 33:12.784
So, it's super easy.

33:12.868 --> 33:14.536
You sit in the chair,
the penny comes to you,

33:14.620 --> 33:16.246
you polish it up and send it on its way.

33:16.330 --> 33:17.915
Sounds like something I can handle.

33:17.998 --> 33:19.291
Of course you can.

33:19.374 --> 33:21.877
Lucky leprechauns were made
for this kind of work.

33:25.214 --> 33:26.215
That's us.

33:27.174 --> 33:30.010
-Uh-uh.
-Go ahead. I'll catch up.

33:30.093 --> 33:31.303
Okeydoke.

33:32.012 --> 33:33.388
I think we should abort.

33:33.472 --> 33:34.890
What, why?

33:34.973 --> 33:36.975
You're not a lucky leprechaun, Sam.

33:37.059 --> 33:39.478
You're an insanely unlucky human.

33:39.561 --> 33:41.980
-Or maybe you've forgotten.
-Trust me. I haven't.

33:42.064 --> 33:43.398
You'll cause a disaster.

33:43.482 --> 33:46.985
Maybe not. Gerry said we sit
in chairs and polish pennies.

33:47.069 --> 33:49.780
And I imagine to polish a penny,
you need to hold a penny.

33:49.863 --> 33:51.657
And if I'm holding a lucky penny--

33:51.740 --> 33:53.909
I get it. You'll be lucky.

33:53.992 --> 33:56.745
Pocket one penny. How hard could it be?

33:58.914 --> 34:00.123
Sam, over here.

34:00.207 --> 34:02.501
-You'll sit right next to me.
-Thanks, Gerry.

34:02.584 --> 34:06.839
Okay, leprechauns,
let's get these pennies in tip-top shape.

34:06.922 --> 34:08.924
The Captain is depending on us.

34:09.675 --> 34:11.385
It's penny time!

34:15.889 --> 34:19.768
Remember, there is nothing to it.
Just stay in your chair.

34:23.355 --> 34:24.898
Grab a penny, Sam.

35:36.053 --> 35:37.262
Don't panic.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.682
You think it was
a bad luck speck that did it?

35:40.766 --> 35:42.392
More like a whole boot full.

35:42.476 --> 35:43.894
Sam!

35:43.977 --> 35:46.146
I told you this would be a disaster.

35:46.230 --> 35:49.566
Well, I didn't expect to get the button.
You saw that, right?

35:49.650 --> 35:50.901
Oh, yes, I saw it.

35:50.984 --> 35:54.571
And now that button's headed
straight back to Arrivals and Departures,

35:54.655 --> 35:56.490
where the Captain will see it for sure.

35:56.573 --> 35:58.367
So, where are we gonna find a penny now?

35:59.076 --> 36:00.327
We're not!

36:00.410 --> 36:02.829
This was it, our one chance.

36:02.913 --> 36:04.414
And now you leave.

36:04.498 --> 36:07.793
No.
The deal was I leave after we get a penny.

36:07.876 --> 36:11.505
The deal is off.
There's nowhere else to get a penny.

36:11.588 --> 36:12.798
Someone need a penny?

36:12.881 --> 36:14.132
Bob does.

36:14.216 --> 36:16.510
He lost his,
and then I flushed it down the toilet--

36:16.593 --> 36:18.595
-Sam!
-What? He's your friend.

36:18.679 --> 36:21.139
-Assistant.
-This is terrible, Bob.

36:21.223 --> 36:23.559
You stopped to eat human food again,
didn't you?

36:23.642 --> 36:25.978
-Yeah. My human food.
-Sam!

36:26.061 --> 36:27.896
What do you mean, your human food?

36:27.980 --> 36:30.858
I'm not a Latvian leprechaun, Gerry.
I'm a human.

36:34.361 --> 36:36.446
Humans cannot be here!

36:36.530 --> 36:37.906
Yeah, Bob mentioned that.

36:38.490 --> 36:42.703
So, you lost your travel penny
and brought a human through the portal.

36:42.786 --> 36:44.580
The Captain is not gonna like this.

36:44.663 --> 36:47.541
And if she finds out,
you'll be banished to Bad Luck!

36:47.624 --> 36:49.626
Wait. There's a Bad Luck here too?

36:49.710 --> 36:52.671
Well, not here, here,
but down there, here, yeah.

36:52.754 --> 36:54.464
It's the other half of our world.

36:54.548 --> 36:57.050
Good Luck on top
and Bad Luck on the bottom,

36:57.134 --> 36:58.802
only their half isn't so nice.

36:58.886 --> 37:02.389
Of course, it isn't.
Bad luck ruins everything it touches.

37:02.472 --> 37:04.766
Why didn't you tell me that's
where you'll be banished, Bob?

37:04.850 --> 37:07.686
-You never asked.
-Because you said no more questions.

37:09.313 --> 37:11.023
They called in the hazmats.

37:26.246 --> 37:28.332
It's the Captain. Quick, hide.

37:28.415 --> 37:29.416
That might be tough.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.752
All right, everyone, clear out.

37:31.835 --> 37:35.297
Evacuate the area
so the rabbits can do their work.

37:37.799 --> 37:39.760
Bob, is that you?

37:39.843 --> 37:41.094
No, Cap.

37:41.178 --> 37:44.640
It's me, Gerry,
from Arrivals and Departures, remember?

37:44.723 --> 37:48.477
-I've been working for you for 100 years--
-Gerry. When did you grow a tail?

37:48.560 --> 37:52.105
-Is there a tail there?
-Captain, what a delight!

37:52.189 --> 37:54.358
And so soon. Lucky me.

37:54.441 --> 37:55.776
What are you doing down here?

37:56.527 --> 37:58.362
Just visiting my leprechaun friends.

37:58.445 --> 38:00.531
You don't have friends, Bob.

38:00.614 --> 38:04.201
They've scanned the crime scene, Captain,
and found no bad luck specks.

38:04.284 --> 38:05.452
Scan it again.

38:05.536 --> 38:09.540
One speck can de-luckify
an entire pile of lucky pennies.

38:10.749 --> 38:12.209
Let's get outta here.

38:12.835 --> 38:15.295
So, there's really no other place
to get a penny?

38:15.379 --> 38:16.380
No!

38:16.463 --> 38:18.966
What about the ones like Bob's
that go missing in the human world?

38:19.049 --> 38:21.510
If they're so valuable,
why don't you go retrieve them?

38:21.593 --> 38:23.512
-We do.
-We do?

38:23.595 --> 38:24.638
Well, we used to.

38:24.721 --> 38:27.432
But not one has been lost
since the Captain took over security.

38:27.516 --> 38:30.310
The old days, if a travel penny
went missing in the human world,

38:30.394 --> 38:32.479
-we'd send in the bunny drone.
-"Bunny drone"?

38:32.563 --> 38:36.525
Yeah. Clever little robot.
They keep it at Arrivals and Departures.

38:36.608 --> 38:37.985
So, let's go get it.

38:38.068 --> 38:40.445
Okay! But it hasn't been used in a decade.

38:40.529 --> 38:43.282
So, first, we'll have to grab
a good luck crystal to power it.

38:43.365 --> 38:45.993
-And where do we get one of those?
-The Luck Floor!

38:46.493 --> 38:47.494
Hold up a minute.

38:47.578 --> 38:50.747
I'll head to Arrivals and Departures
and fire up the bunny drone

38:50.831 --> 38:52.499
while you two sneak into Mission Control.

38:52.583 --> 38:53.834
Wait. Why?

38:53.917 --> 38:56.795
That's where they keep the joystick
that controls the drone.

38:56.879 --> 38:58.922
Great! But crystal first.

38:59.006 --> 39:01.633
So, Luck Floor, here we come.

39:02.217 --> 39:06.013
But the crystals are up high.
We'll need someone tall to reach it.

39:06.096 --> 39:08.307
-I'm tall.
-Not a chance.

39:08.390 --> 39:10.642
-She's way too unlucky.
-It's true.

39:11.018 --> 39:14.062
She only has to grab one.
I think she can do it.

39:16.481 --> 39:18.901
Fine. I mean, what could go wrong?

39:18.984 --> 39:20.611
That's the spirit, boss.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.286
Sounds like our little deal
is back on, Bob.

39:29.369 --> 39:32.414
-Yes, and then you'll leave.
-True to my word.

39:33.624 --> 39:35.292
So, where do we get the luck crystal?

39:35.375 --> 39:37.794
We'll just walk down the hall
and snag one.

39:37.878 --> 39:39.129
Piece of cake.

39:45.844 --> 39:49.306
They're all staring right at Sam.
What do we do, boss?

39:51.225 --> 39:55.521
She's from Latvia. Tallest leprechauns
in the world come from Latvia.

39:55.604 --> 39:58.982
And we're her Land of Luck
leprechaun orientation guides.

40:01.109 --> 40:02.986
Lead on, Gerry.

40:03.737 --> 40:04.738
Right!

40:09.451 --> 40:14.498
So, this is Good Luck R and D,
where good luck is created.

40:15.290 --> 40:18.001
Finding your lost wedding ring
in the brownies?

40:18.085 --> 40:20.379
Shirley always comes up
with the best stuff.

40:20.462 --> 40:23.632
Wait. They actually think up
the good luck?

40:23.715 --> 40:26.260
Yeah. Those two work in Happy Accidents,

40:26.343 --> 40:29.680
one of the many Good Luck departments
like Lucky in Love,

40:30.347 --> 40:33.475
Front Row Parking Spot!
Right Place, Right Time.

40:33.559 --> 40:35.435
You humans love that one.

40:35.519 --> 40:39.565
And by "humans," you mean
the ones who live in the human world,

40:39.648 --> 40:40.858
don't ya, Ger?

40:40.941 --> 40:42.901
Exactly right.

40:42.985 --> 40:46.530
Next, the lucky ideas are
stamped onto an idea leaf,

40:46.613 --> 40:48.240
and then sent to the Luck Floor.

40:48.991 --> 40:51.952
And luck passing through
in five, four, three, two…

40:52.035 --> 40:54.705
Let's take this tour
to the upper level, shall we?

41:08.051 --> 41:10.804
The ladybugs deliver the leaves
to the Pig Foreman.

41:10.888 --> 41:12.431
And he makes the crystals?

41:12.514 --> 41:14.558
Nah, they do.

41:16.226 --> 41:20.063
Latvia. She's from Latvia. Latvia.

41:24.860 --> 41:27.362
For the crystal.
Janice said I could borrow it.

41:27.446 --> 41:29.573
All right, luck makers!

41:29.656 --> 41:32.034
We've got a full docket today!

41:32.117 --> 41:34.828
Good morning, magical swine!

41:34.912 --> 41:36.079
A dragon?

41:36.163 --> 41:37.831
Yeah, she's the CEO of Good Luck.

41:40.209 --> 41:43.504
And the only creature
that can sniff out bad luck specks.

41:43.587 --> 41:45.005
Probably why she's here.

41:45.088 --> 41:47.257
She must've heard what happened
at the Penny Depot.

41:51.178 --> 41:54.723
With your luck, I wouldnae get too close.

41:58.018 --> 42:00.437
There's not a speck of bad luck here.

42:01.647 --> 42:04.149
Which means it's that time again.

42:04.233 --> 42:08.612
Time to open your hearts
to do what only you can do.

42:08.695 --> 42:11.990
-Let me hear it!
-Bring hope and joy to the world!

42:12.950 --> 42:14.993
That's what good luck does.

42:15.077 --> 42:18.539
The luck you create today
could change a life tomorrow.

42:20.499 --> 42:22.042
Have a lucky day, Phil.

42:22.125 --> 42:23.460
You too, Boss.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.677
Okay, you heard her!

42:31.760 --> 42:35.764
Let's make some good luck,
you prosperity-making wonder pigs!

42:35.848 --> 42:37.057
Duck down!

42:46.608 --> 42:48.861
They're doing it.
They're making the crystals.

42:48.944 --> 42:50.612
And we just need one for the bunny drone.

42:50.696 --> 42:53.574
-This is it, Sam. Get ready.
-Ready.

42:53.657 --> 42:55.784
Now, Sam! Grab one!

42:56.618 --> 42:58.996
I can't quite reach.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.416
-Jump!
-No, she's too unlucky!

43:13.552 --> 43:15.470
Nice move, Bob!

43:15.554 --> 43:17.306
Way to go, team!

43:17.389 --> 43:20.017
I'll go to Arrivals and Departures
and find the drone.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.685
You guys head straight to Mission Control.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.523
Because of you, Bob has a real chance.

43:27.357 --> 43:29.359
You can keep my jacket if you want!

43:30.402 --> 43:31.904
You have nice friends.

43:31.987 --> 43:34.698
Yeah, like I said, he's just my assistant.

43:36.783 --> 43:39.244
I know we'd still need
to get you a lucky penny,

43:39.328 --> 43:41.914
but why couldn't I just take Hazel
one of those?

43:41.997 --> 43:43.415
It doesn't work that way.

43:43.498 --> 43:46.877
The good luck idea is stored
inside the crystal until it's released,

43:46.960 --> 43:48.795
and there's only one thing
that can release it.

43:48.879 --> 43:50.714
-What's that?
-The Randomizer.

43:50.797 --> 43:53.133
It smashes the crystals into lucky dust,

43:53.217 --> 43:56.178
then sends it randomly
through the luck lines into your world.

43:56.261 --> 43:58.680
Wait. You're saying luck is random?

43:58.764 --> 44:01.934
Aye. Hence the name, Randomizer.

44:02.017 --> 44:04.019
Look, it's happening right now.

44:04.603 --> 44:07.189
-What are those?
-The ancient luck stones.

44:07.272 --> 44:09.691
Like the batteries
that keep the arms spinning.

44:09.775 --> 44:12.694
The good luck stone draws in
the good luck from above,

44:12.778 --> 44:15.864
and the bad luck stone draws in
the bad luck from below.

44:16.823 --> 44:18.784
And those must be the luck lines.

44:18.867 --> 44:19.868
Aye, that's them.

44:19.952 --> 44:22.329
Like the power cords
connecting our worlds.

44:22.996 --> 44:25.040
So, who makes the bad luck?

44:25.123 --> 44:26.583
Roots and goblins, mainly.

44:26.667 --> 44:28.752
Roots and goblins?

44:28.836 --> 44:31.255
I should have known it would be monsters.

44:31.338 --> 44:32.756
Gerry, are ya there?

44:32.840 --> 44:34.925
10-4.
Reading you loud and clear, boss.

44:35.008 --> 44:36.260
Where are you?

44:36.343 --> 44:38.846
Entering
Arrivals and Departures right now.

44:38.929 --> 44:40.347
Good. Make it quick.

44:40.931 --> 44:43.976
-Hey, Gerry.
-Gael. Quinn.

44:53.068 --> 44:55.696
-I found the drone.
-Good. We're here.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.447
-Mission Control.
-Great.

44:57.531 --> 45:00.033
-All the bunny desks have a joystick.
-Perfect!

45:00.117 --> 45:03.620
We'll use that back one.
That way no one can see my screen.

45:03.704 --> 45:05.581
But how are we gonna distract the bunny?

45:06.081 --> 45:07.708
-Maybe I could try--
-Uh-uh!

45:07.791 --> 45:11.336
No trying, remember?
We've seen what happens when you do.

45:11.670 --> 45:12.671
Okay.

45:12.754 --> 45:15.632
I've got this one covered.
You wait right here.

45:15.716 --> 45:18.802
I mean it. Don't move a muscle.

45:23.307 --> 45:25.267
They're tracking luck all over the world.

45:34.526 --> 45:36.486
That's one lucky grandma.

45:42.409 --> 45:44.244
Now, that looks familiar.

45:46.121 --> 45:48.373
It doesn't feel random, does it?

45:50.417 --> 45:53.170
So, how's your day so far?

45:53.253 --> 45:54.338
Good.

45:56.006 --> 45:57.007
Carrot.

45:58.634 --> 46:00.219
Dropped your keyboard.

46:00.302 --> 46:03.597
Guess you better run off to IT
and grab a new one.

46:11.563 --> 46:13.232
Joystick activated, Gerry.

46:13.315 --> 46:14.566
We're nearly there.

46:15.150 --> 46:16.693
I'm putting in the crystal.

46:18.695 --> 46:20.697
She's ready for takeoff, boss.

46:20.781 --> 46:23.534
Brilliant! The target's been located.

46:23.617 --> 46:25.369
Let's get that bunny in the air.

46:28.372 --> 46:30.457
Operation "lucky penny" is a go!

46:31.291 --> 46:32.626
She's all yours.

46:32.709 --> 46:33.961
Yes!

46:34.044 --> 46:36.755
Just get her
within striking distance of the target.

46:36.839 --> 46:39.299
When she's close enough,
she'll lock onto it.

46:40.175 --> 46:41.343
I'll open the portal.

47:00.737 --> 47:04.950
Oh, no! Bob, look up. Look up. Bob.

47:07.244 --> 47:10.163
Oh, you must be my lucky star

47:11.206 --> 47:15.377
'Cause you shine on me
Wherever you are

47:15.460 --> 47:19.256
I just think of you
And I start to glow

47:19.339 --> 47:23.969
And I need your love so baby you know

47:24.052 --> 47:28.265
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight

47:28.348 --> 47:32.311
Starlight, starbright
Make everything all right

47:32.394 --> 47:36.356
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight

47:36.440 --> 47:40.360
Starlight, starbright
Ooh, yeah!

47:41.278 --> 47:42.821
Come on!

47:43.614 --> 47:44.615
Let's go!

47:45.908 --> 47:47.201
Yeah!

47:49.453 --> 47:50.579
Ooh!

47:50.662 --> 47:53.207
It's flashing!
That means she's located the penny.

47:53.290 --> 47:54.791
How will we know when she's got it?

47:54.875 --> 47:57.002
She'll do a little dance.
Bunnies love to dance.

47:57.085 --> 47:58.378
You don't say.

48:00.714 --> 48:03.217
Shine your heavenly body tonight…

48:03.300 --> 48:06.178
She's dancing! She's got the penny!

48:08.055 --> 48:09.056
'Cause I know…

48:09.139 --> 48:10.599
Now, press the "home" button.

48:10.682 --> 48:12.809
…you're gonna make everything
All right

48:12.893 --> 48:15.312
I'll wait for the penny.
You get out of there.

48:15.395 --> 48:19.483
You may be my lucky star

48:19.566 --> 48:25.072
Oh, what you do to me, baby?
Oh, come on

48:25.656 --> 48:29.868
I'm the luckiest by far

48:31.036 --> 48:32.955
Why didn't you tell me you could sing?

48:33.038 --> 48:35.499
You never asked. No questions, remember?

48:35.582 --> 48:38.252
Right, because we don't need
to get to know each other.

48:38.335 --> 48:40.337
Attention, all citizens.

48:40.420 --> 48:44.174
A very suspicious item was turned in
to the penny drop.

48:44.258 --> 48:45.259
A button.

48:45.342 --> 48:49.930
A line cat used this button,
thinking it was a lucky penny,

48:50.013 --> 48:53.851
and was run over by a tricycle
in the human world.

48:54.434 --> 48:55.435
Don't worry.

48:55.519 --> 48:57.813
Magical creatures heal
at the speed of light.

48:58.814 --> 48:59.815
See?

48:59.898 --> 49:03.735
Whoever turned in this button
did not turn in their travel penny,

49:03.819 --> 49:06.613
which means there is
a penny thief amongst us.

49:06.697 --> 49:09.157
Crikey, I didnae steal it. I just lost it.

49:09.950 --> 49:13.370
And the culprit is
one of these three cats.

49:13.453 --> 49:14.830
Uh-oh.

49:14.913 --> 49:18.125
Everyone knows the punishment
for stealing good luck,

49:18.208 --> 49:20.752
is banishment to Bad Luck.

49:20.836 --> 49:23.046
So I'm coming for you, penny thief.

49:23.130 --> 49:26.383
And, Bob, if it turns out to be you,

49:26.466 --> 49:28.635
I'm really going to enjoy this.

49:29.803 --> 49:31.388
We gotta turn in that penny.

49:31.471 --> 49:34.141
-The drone's back!
-Does she have the penny?

49:34.808 --> 49:36.894
Do you see the penny, Gerry?

49:36.977 --> 49:39.021
Yeah, I see it.

49:39.104 --> 49:40.731
Grab it, Gerry! Grab it!

49:41.732 --> 49:43.317
I just gotta get my gloves.

49:43.400 --> 49:45.110
What? No! What you doin'?

49:45.194 --> 49:48.197
Get in there and grab it
before the vacuums turn on.

49:50.032 --> 49:51.533
Did you get it, Gerry?

49:52.576 --> 49:54.703
-Are you on mute, Gerry?
-No.

49:54.786 --> 49:56.371
I'm here but the penny is gone.

49:56.455 --> 49:58.749
-What?
-The whole drone got sucked right out.

49:58.832 --> 50:02.044
I'm sorry, boss. You were right.
I should've just grabbed it.

50:02.628 --> 50:04.671
But you could still get it
from the In Between.

50:04.755 --> 50:07.382
-"In Between"?
-Where the human debris goes.

50:07.466 --> 50:09.885
Exactly! The drone will be in bin six.

50:09.968 --> 50:12.221
You just gotta get to it before Jeff does.

50:12.304 --> 50:13.305
Who's Jeff?

50:13.388 --> 50:15.849
Hopefully, you won't have to find out.
Come on.

50:23.565 --> 50:25.609
So, why do they call it the In Between?

50:25.692 --> 50:28.403
It's the space between the lands
of Good and Bad Luck.

50:28.487 --> 50:30.113
Kinda like a basement.

50:31.073 --> 50:32.616
Now we're talking.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.660
Hit the button, would ya?

50:53.178 --> 50:54.888
What button did you press?

50:54.972 --> 50:57.891
BL, basement level. Why?

50:57.975 --> 51:04.439
I said it was like a basement.
You're supposed to push IB, In Between.

51:05.023 --> 51:07.693
So then, what's BL stand for?

51:07.776 --> 51:12.489
Bad Luck! And thanks to you,
we're headed there right now.

51:13.949 --> 51:15.158
What's happening?

51:15.242 --> 51:20.247
Gravity shift. Bad Luck's gravity works
the opposite way of ours. Climb the wall!

51:20.664 --> 51:21.915
-What?
-Now!

51:38.932 --> 51:41.768
Sam, hurry. Get back in the lift.

51:41.852 --> 51:42.978
Yes, please.

51:48.233 --> 51:50.319
No!

51:53.864 --> 51:56.867
If the lift takes off,
just meet me in the In Between.

51:56.950 --> 52:00.370
What? Oh, no you don't.
You are not leaving me down here.

52:00.454 --> 52:02.456
There's a tiny door.
You just have to find it.

52:02.539 --> 52:05.959
Go to Luck Tower 13,
right past the Lost Sock Dispensary.

52:06.043 --> 52:08.420
-What are you talking about?
-Listen to me.

52:08.504 --> 52:12.799
Tower 13 to the Dog Poop Research Center,
then find the purple light.

52:12.883 --> 52:14.092
Tiny door will be there,

52:14.176 --> 52:16.428
somewhere between "Stepped in It"
and "Tracked It in the House."

52:16.512 --> 52:17.346
Piece of cake.

52:17.429 --> 52:19.806
But I'm not from here.

52:19.890 --> 52:24.061
Right. Okay, this will really help.
The Bad Luck world is a mirror--

52:26.813 --> 52:32.569
Great. Okay, Tower 13, Dog Poop
Research Center, purple light, tiny door.

52:32.653 --> 52:35.113
Hey! Leprechaun. What are you doing here?

53:02.015 --> 53:03.100
Tower 13.

53:57.237 --> 53:59.114
Okay, he said it was somewhere between

53:59.198 --> 54:01.867
"Stepped in It"
and "Tracked It in the House."

54:05.245 --> 54:07.122
Three stories?

54:07.206 --> 54:09.291
That's a lot of dog poop research.

54:09.917 --> 54:13.921
"Slipped on it.
Smell it but can't find it."

54:16.173 --> 54:19.718
"Left the house without a poop bag.
Torn poop bag."

54:20.469 --> 54:22.638
"It's a wet one." Gross.

54:23.430 --> 54:24.640
"Stepped in It."

54:25.474 --> 54:28.018
And "Tracked It in the House."
Purple light!

54:41.532 --> 54:42.950
Bob?

54:50.040 --> 54:54.044
I can do this. I'm almost there!

54:56.046 --> 54:57.047
Oh, no.

55:13.897 --> 55:15.065
Huh?

55:15.816 --> 55:17.901
Bob? Is that you?

55:19.278 --> 55:20.737
It is you.

55:20.821 --> 55:26.201
Bob! Hey, it's me. It's Sam.
Look down here.

55:28.537 --> 55:29.913
Sam, you made it!

55:29.997 --> 55:32.124
-Yeah.
-Watch out.

55:34.543 --> 55:36.461
Okay, so now jump.

55:36.545 --> 55:37.838
What?

55:37.921 --> 55:41.300
Bad Luck gravity works the opposite
of ours, remember?

55:42.718 --> 55:43.719
Right.

55:47.681 --> 55:50.350
Down to go up, that's just weird.

55:50.434 --> 55:52.769
-So, how did you know?
-Know what?

55:52.853 --> 55:54.521
How to get here through Bad Luck?

55:54.605 --> 55:57.482
Well, simple.
Bad Luck is a mirror image of Good Luck.

55:59.401 --> 56:02.779
-And this is the In Between?
-Not quite.

56:02.863 --> 56:04.239
Come on, give me a hand.

56:07.659 --> 56:10.454
This is the In Between.

56:14.625 --> 56:17.085
Gerry said the drone would be in bin six.

56:18.587 --> 56:19.838
Bad Luck dust!

56:20.589 --> 56:21.798
Shake it off.

56:23.467 --> 56:24.468
It's Jeff.

56:24.843 --> 56:26.637
Forget that! Hide!

56:27.804 --> 56:29.681
He is a total blabbermouth.

56:29.765 --> 56:33.060
If he sees us, we'll never have a chance
to find the penny.

56:34.394 --> 56:35.562
Jeff's a unicorn?

56:36.647 --> 56:38.482
Warming up the muscles.

56:39.191 --> 56:40.859
Heiliger Strohsack.

56:42.444 --> 56:44.404
It's like a strasse of bad luck.

56:45.072 --> 56:46.949
What's happening, guys?

56:49.409 --> 56:50.410
Hello.

56:52.162 --> 56:54.665
You surprise my heart to stop.

56:56.750 --> 57:02.297
Mighty leprechaun Fräulein!
Okay. Well done, nature.

57:02.381 --> 57:03.382
Yep.

57:04.550 --> 57:06.051
Robert, is that you?

57:06.635 --> 57:08.011
Hi, Jeff.

57:08.095 --> 57:09.263
Guten Tag.

57:09.346 --> 57:10.931
So you two are friends?

57:11.682 --> 57:13.433
Robert doesn't want friends,

57:13.517 --> 57:17.187
but lucky for him,
I wouldn't take nein for an answer.

57:17.271 --> 57:21.191
Zip, zip, zip and whisk, whisk, whisk.
They are stuck to your shoesy.

57:21.275 --> 57:26.697
Sometimes a little goes… ja?
From my homemade bad luck apparat.

57:26.780 --> 57:28.866
It's my one-of-a-kind mixer machine

57:28.949 --> 57:32.369
that feeds the bad luck
straight into das Randomizer.

57:34.162 --> 57:36.999
-Will you show me how it works?
-Ja, komm.

57:37.708 --> 57:41.920
Es ist sehr exciting to have visitors.
I'm excited. I can't hide it.

57:42.588 --> 57:45.549
I'll catch up. I need to
find some kitty litter.

57:45.632 --> 57:47.301
Sounds gross, Robert. Bye.

57:48.427 --> 57:51.388
So the thing is,
the bad luck sticks to itself

57:51.471 --> 57:54.016
like the butter of nuts
to the roof of your mouth.

57:54.099 --> 57:57.519
So, you're saying bad luck
attracts more bad luck?

57:57.603 --> 57:59.229
-'Cause that would explain a lot.
-Ja.

57:59.313 --> 58:02.733
Like glue. See?
That's what used to happen.

58:02.816 --> 58:07.404
So I made eine mixing machine,
and voilà! No more clogs.

58:07.487 --> 58:10.407
The bad luck flows right
to das Randomizer.

58:10.490 --> 58:13.327
-That's some top-notch engineering, Jeff.
-Danke schön.

58:13.911 --> 58:16.079
And I no longer go by Jeff.

58:16.580 --> 58:20.334
Ja, recently I have reverted
to my birth name, Heimdall!

58:20.417 --> 58:24.213
Heim-dall. Like, you know, the little doll
but first with a "Heim" in front.

58:24.296 --> 58:26.673
Okay, ja, sure, the name fit better
when I was younger.

58:26.757 --> 58:29.009
I get it. You don't have to say it.

58:29.885 --> 58:31.470
Is that the Dragon?

58:31.553 --> 58:34.014
Ja, that's her. Meine one true love.

58:34.097 --> 58:37.601
She smelted me this locket,
and she saved my life.

58:37.684 --> 58:38.977
What happened?

58:39.061 --> 58:44.107
Before my mixing machine, I had to clean
out the bad luck clogs by hand.

58:44.191 --> 58:50.697
And one day the pipe, it plätzen!
And gesprüht bad luck dust all over me.

58:50.781 --> 58:56.161
The Dragon heard and sent for me sofort.
It was love at first look.

58:56.245 --> 58:59.623
She borrowed me a lucky penny
to counteract the bad luck.

58:59.706 --> 59:02.251
But bad luck can really linger.

59:02.334 --> 59:08.173
It took four months to recover, but they
were the beste four months of my life.

59:08.757 --> 59:11.009
And then she broke my heart.

59:11.093 --> 59:12.094
Why?

59:12.177 --> 59:15.013
Well, sometimes I would track
a little bad luck into Good Luck

59:15.097 --> 59:16.390
on my shoesies.

59:16.473 --> 59:21.436
She was so terrified of what bad luck
might do to her creatures and her world,

59:21.520 --> 59:23.021
so she broke it off.

59:23.105 --> 59:24.731
And now we're both alone.

59:25.482 --> 59:26.608
How sad.

59:30.487 --> 59:32.406
If I could leave meine work, I would.

59:32.489 --> 59:36.577
But we einhorn have cared for
the Randomizer since the buttocks of dawn.

59:37.870 --> 59:39.830
Goody! A delivery!

59:46.044 --> 59:47.296
Da bist du, Robert!

59:48.088 --> 59:51.592
Guess what? Earlier,
I found a bunny drone in the pile.

59:52.384 --> 59:55.012
Ja, just one. Ja, I wanted a set of six.

59:55.095 --> 59:56.346
Do you still have it?

59:58.015 --> 59:59.433
Und here she is.

59:59.516 --> 1:00:01.727
-Was there a penny?
-Ja, Robert.

1:00:01.810 --> 1:00:05.856
But it was so stinky,
so I sent it up to the Penny Depot

1:00:05.939 --> 1:00:09.109
to be disinfected
and put back into circulation.

1:00:13.155 --> 1:00:16.742
I heard the Captain interrogated poor Edna
for hours about that penny.

1:00:16.825 --> 1:00:18.702
She was clean as a whistle, of course.

1:00:18.785 --> 1:00:22.331
So now it's down to just two cats,
Ernie and Bob.

1:00:22.414 --> 1:00:23.832
I'm doomed.

1:00:26.210 --> 1:00:29.922
Maybe not. You lay low.
I'm going to see the Dragon.

1:00:30.005 --> 1:00:32.633
You can't, Sam.
She'll sniff out your bad luck.

1:00:32.716 --> 1:00:37.513
That's exactly what I want her to do.
And I'm not taking any chances.

1:00:37.596 --> 1:00:39.932
If the Dragon helped an engineer unicorn,

1:00:40.015 --> 1:00:42.309
maybe she'll help
an unlucky leprechaun too.

1:00:42.392 --> 1:00:45.521
If she discovers you're a human,
she'll never let you go home.

1:00:45.604 --> 1:00:47.481
I have to risk it.

1:00:47.564 --> 1:00:50.567
I can't give up on Hazel. Or you, Bob.

1:00:51.860 --> 1:00:53.153
Don't go far.

1:00:53.237 --> 1:00:55.614
If I get a penny, we're back in business.

1:01:00.452 --> 1:01:04.248
Good afternoon,
I'm here to see the Dragon.

1:01:05.749 --> 1:01:09.670
Leapin' rabbits! It's the tall leprechaun.

1:01:09.753 --> 1:01:11.213
Send her in, Hopsberg.

1:01:11.797 --> 1:01:13.549
And the memos too.

1:01:22.099 --> 1:01:24.059
Twice in one day.

1:01:24.142 --> 1:01:26.770
You were on the Luck Floor this morning,
right?

1:01:26.854 --> 1:01:28.856
Yes, that was me.

1:01:28.939 --> 1:01:30.315
I thought so.

1:01:30.941 --> 1:01:34.361
Luck levels looking excellent as usual.

1:01:36.196 --> 1:01:37.531
See you next week.

1:01:38.657 --> 1:01:39.658
I'm so happy.

1:01:39.741 --> 1:01:43.954
There are so few creatures
here I can actually look in the eye.

1:01:44.037 --> 1:01:47.541
We lucky ladies of stature
oughta stick together, don't you think?

1:01:47.624 --> 1:01:48.709
Yeah.

1:01:50.961 --> 1:01:52.004
What's this?

1:01:56.300 --> 1:01:57.676
Rabbits!

1:02:02.598 --> 1:02:04.892
Under the shoe.

1:02:06.143 --> 1:02:07.144
Hurry!

1:02:18.655 --> 1:02:19.698
Much better.

1:02:19.781 --> 1:02:26.205
You see, the tiniest amount of bad luck
can shut down our entire operation.

1:02:27.289 --> 1:02:29.791
We work so hard to keep it out,
but, you know,

1:02:29.875 --> 1:02:35.214
every so often,
bad luck manages to find its way in.

1:02:35.297 --> 1:02:38.717
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean
to upset you. I just--

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:42.012
It's not you, dear. Oh, no. It's bad luck.

1:02:42.095 --> 1:02:46.016
It's a cruel, corrosive agent of sadness
and destruction that--

1:02:49.186 --> 1:02:52.606
I agree. And it explains a lot.

1:02:52.689 --> 1:02:55.526
Why it all went haywire
at the Penny Depot for one.

1:02:56.109 --> 1:02:57.194
So that was you.

1:02:57.277 --> 1:03:00.531
Yeah. It's been a bit of a day.

1:03:01.198 --> 1:03:03.075
Poor, innocent leprechaun.

1:03:03.158 --> 1:03:08.914
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
And you only experienced one speck.

1:03:08.997 --> 1:03:13.085
Think of the poor souls in the Land of
the Unlucky tasked with making the stuff.

1:03:13.168 --> 1:03:19.091
Can you imagine dealing with bad luck
every single day of your life?

1:03:19.716 --> 1:03:23.554
-A truly miserable existence.
-Yeah.

1:03:23.637 --> 1:03:26.807
And I don't suppose it's much fun
for the humans who receive it either.

1:03:26.890 --> 1:03:28.308
It isn't.

1:03:28.392 --> 1:03:31.895
I've seen them when I'm out leprechauning.

1:03:32.396 --> 1:03:38.026
These unlucky humans, who,
no matter how hard they try,

1:03:38.777 --> 1:03:44.283
bad luck always shows up just
to beat them down and make them feel so…

1:03:44.366 --> 1:03:46.034
Alone.

1:03:47.035 --> 1:03:48.203
Exactly.

1:03:49.580 --> 1:03:52.124
Which is why
we make the good kind of luck,

1:03:52.207 --> 1:03:54.751
and as much as we possibly can.

1:03:54.835 --> 1:03:55.919
Yeah.

1:03:56.003 --> 1:03:59.798
'Cause when you have good luck,
it feels like anything is possible.

1:03:59.882 --> 1:04:02.467
-I guess it's because--
-Good luck is joy.

1:04:02.551 --> 1:04:03.552
Yes.

1:04:04.303 --> 1:04:08.682
And hope. It's like you said,
it's the good kind of luck.

1:04:09.433 --> 1:04:15.230
And were I the queen of the universe,
and I suspect it's a job I would excel at,

1:04:15.314 --> 1:04:17.482
I'd rid the world of bad luck altogether!

1:04:18.442 --> 1:04:20.819
Eradicate it completely.

1:04:20.903 --> 1:04:25.365
Good luck all the time,
what could be better?

1:04:25.449 --> 1:04:26.700
Not a single thing.

1:04:26.783 --> 1:04:29.536
And you can bet
those humans would like it too.

1:04:29.620 --> 1:04:33.874
Yeah.
Then their world could look like this.

1:04:34.291 --> 1:04:36.001
They should be so lucky.

1:04:36.084 --> 1:04:40.464
You did the right thing coming to see me.
You-- What was your name?

1:04:41.048 --> 1:04:43.050
Sam. My name is Sam.

1:04:44.092 --> 1:04:46.720
Sam. Call me Babe.

1:04:46.803 --> 1:04:50.641
You know a lot of creatures
are intimidated by tall women, Sam.

1:04:58.273 --> 1:05:02.110
Carry it for a few days. You'll be back
to your lucky self in no time.

1:05:03.612 --> 1:05:07.241
The last creature I helped
needed four months with a penny

1:05:07.324 --> 1:05:09.076
until his bad luck was gone.

1:05:09.660 --> 1:05:11.370
I've heard it can really linger.

1:05:11.954 --> 1:05:14.748
They were the best four months of my life.

1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:19.461
Thank you, Babe.

1:05:21.964 --> 1:05:24.258
Just return it to the Depot
when you're done.

1:05:24.341 --> 1:05:25.676
I will.

1:05:28.303 --> 1:05:32.099
You're about to make
a little girl and a lucky cat so happy.

1:05:32.975 --> 1:05:34.351
Take it easy!

1:05:34.434 --> 1:05:37.229
Get off me.
I won't be cat-handled like this.

1:05:37.312 --> 1:05:40.023
We traced the missing penny
back to you, Bob.

1:05:40.107 --> 1:05:41.400
You have no proof.

1:05:41.483 --> 1:05:43.443
This button is all the proof we need.

1:05:43.527 --> 1:05:45.904
It's got your polydactyl paw prints
all over it.

1:05:46.613 --> 1:05:48.282
-I can explain.
-It's too late.

1:05:48.365 --> 1:05:51.076
You'll be banished
to Bad Luck where you belong.

1:06:08.468 --> 1:06:11.972
Obstructing justice?
I oughta arrest you too.

1:06:12.055 --> 1:06:14.766
I was just catching up to Bob
to give him this.

1:06:15.350 --> 1:06:16.560
You got it.

1:06:16.643 --> 1:06:18.687
Yes, Bob. I did.

1:06:18.770 --> 1:06:21.231
Must've fallen right out of his collar.

1:06:22.482 --> 1:06:25.652
Maybe when you stopped
to try that tasty meat bread.

1:06:25.736 --> 1:06:28.864
And you're absolutely sure
this one is mine?

1:06:29.615 --> 1:06:30.616
I'm sure.

1:06:31.825 --> 1:06:33.744
She's a real lifesaver, this one.

1:06:34.328 --> 1:06:37.623
If you had your travel penny,
why did you turn in the button, Bob?

1:06:37.706 --> 1:06:41.084
Silly mistake.
I just threw the wrong one into the drop.

1:06:41.168 --> 1:06:42.503
When I discovered the mix-up,

1:06:42.586 --> 1:06:45.339
I was heading
straight back to Decon to turn it in,

1:06:45.422 --> 1:06:49.009
and then I guess that's
when the little bugger just slipped out.

1:06:49.593 --> 1:06:51.845
Just like that, no travel penny.

1:06:51.929 --> 1:06:52.763
You know,

1:06:52.846 --> 1:06:58.268
I'm starting to think that maybe the
equipment rabbits issued me a bum collar.

1:06:58.352 --> 1:07:00.604
This isn't the first time
it's got loose, you know.

1:07:00.896 --> 1:07:02.064
I see.

1:07:02.147 --> 1:07:06.610
Well, faulty equipment is unacceptable,
Bob. You're right.

1:07:06.693 --> 1:07:08.946
Aye, it most certainly is.

1:07:09.029 --> 1:07:10.364
Here you go, Captain.

1:07:14.618 --> 1:07:18.956
I can't believe you just did that.
I mean, thank you, like, a lot,

1:07:19.039 --> 1:07:22.125
but you could've taken that penny
straight to your friend Hazel.

1:07:22.209 --> 1:07:25.045
Her first, then me, that was the deal.

1:07:25.128 --> 1:07:29.132
I could never let you be sent to Bad Luck
so that Hazel could have good luck.

1:07:29.216 --> 1:07:31.844
-It doesn't work like that.
-Well, how does it work?

1:07:31.927 --> 1:07:35.514
Because I don't want you to go home
and leave me here feeling guilty

1:07:35.597 --> 1:07:37.808
that she doesn't get
to use a lucky penny now.

1:07:37.891 --> 1:07:39.601
You think I'm going home?

1:07:39.685 --> 1:07:41.186
Wait. You're not?

1:07:41.270 --> 1:07:43.355
I came here to help Hazel,

1:07:43.438 --> 1:07:46.525
and I only have one hour left to do it
before her visit.

1:07:46.608 --> 1:07:49.444
If you're actually feeling guilty,
then you can help me.

1:07:49.528 --> 1:07:52.656
But there's no way to get another penny.

1:07:52.739 --> 1:07:55.242
For what we're doing,
we won't need a penny.

1:07:55.951 --> 1:07:57.160
What are we gonna do?

1:07:58.745 --> 1:08:00.497
We're gonna turn off bad luck.

1:08:00.581 --> 1:08:02.332
If we shut down Jeff's mixer machine,

1:08:02.416 --> 1:08:05.460
the bad luck should stick to itself
and clog up the pipe

1:08:05.544 --> 1:08:07.296
so it can't travel to the Randomizer.

1:08:07.379 --> 1:08:10.924
And if no bad luck gets to the Randomizer…

1:08:11.008 --> 1:08:13.427
No bad luck gets to the human world.

1:08:13.510 --> 1:08:15.095
Wait. What about Jeff?

1:08:15.179 --> 1:08:18.640
Und schneller. Und schneller.
Und steil. Ja, steil.

1:08:18.724 --> 1:08:20.309
Go down that berg.

1:08:21.435 --> 1:08:23.478
I have no words.

1:08:23.562 --> 1:08:26.231
Yeah, I think we're good for a bit.

1:08:27.816 --> 1:08:30.402
You know we can't do this permanently,
right?

1:08:30.484 --> 1:08:33.113
Of course not. That's where you come in.

1:08:33.197 --> 1:08:35.240
I'm gonna turn it back on.

1:08:35.323 --> 1:08:37.451
All Hazel needs is two hours tops.

1:08:37.533 --> 1:08:39.828
And then I flip the switch. And that's it.

1:08:39.912 --> 1:08:44.541
We're even. Fini, complet.
Case closed. Deal done.

1:08:44.625 --> 1:08:46.542
You'll never see my face again.

1:08:47.502 --> 1:08:49.630
Great. Here goes.

1:08:57.804 --> 1:08:59.680
Look at that.

1:09:01.099 --> 1:09:02.475
It's starting to stick.

1:09:08.273 --> 1:09:09.274
It's working.

1:09:10.067 --> 1:09:11.693
I wish I could see Hazel.

1:09:11.777 --> 1:09:13.612
I think I can handle that.

1:09:13.694 --> 1:09:16.948
Really?
She lives two miles east of the café.

1:09:17.032 --> 1:09:19.618
Tell me again
why she needs good luck so badly.

1:09:19.701 --> 1:09:23.037
If her visit goes well,
she could find her forever family.

1:09:23.121 --> 1:09:24.706
Which is what exactly?

1:09:24.790 --> 1:09:28.502
It's the people who are always there
for you, no matter what happens.

1:09:29.086 --> 1:09:32.130
The ones who don't leave, they stick.

1:09:35.425 --> 1:09:36.426
There.

1:09:36.510 --> 1:09:38.511
-Is that her?
-Yeah.

1:09:38.595 --> 1:09:42.057
It looks like the couple will be there
any minute. It's all I hoped for,

1:09:42.140 --> 1:09:45.644
a little good luck for Hazel,
and we did it, Bob.

1:09:45.727 --> 1:09:47.604
I swear I could hug you right now.

1:09:47.688 --> 1:09:49.689
Cats aren't really huggers.

1:09:49.773 --> 1:09:51.899
Well, I love hugs.

1:09:56.446 --> 1:09:59.116
So, that's it then. Deal finally done.

1:09:59.199 --> 1:10:00.784
Please thank Gerry for me.

1:10:00.868 --> 1:10:03.495
And I'm sorry I stretched out his clothes.

1:10:03.579 --> 1:10:07.666
Hey, Sam. I'm curious.
What do you hope for now?

1:10:07.749 --> 1:10:09.626
Are you asking me questions, Bob?

1:10:09.710 --> 1:10:11.128
Now that you're finally leaving,

1:10:11.211 --> 1:10:13.172
it seemed like a good time
to get to know you better.

1:10:13.255 --> 1:10:14.715
In that case,

1:10:14.798 --> 1:10:18.093
I guess I just hope
I can do something good with my life.

1:10:18.177 --> 1:10:20.846
That my bad luck won't
get in the way, you know?

1:10:20.929 --> 1:10:23.599
Aye. I think I do.

1:10:24.725 --> 1:10:27.561
Right. Well, that's us.

1:10:34.193 --> 1:10:35.194
Huh?

1:10:37.029 --> 1:10:40.115
It's coming from the In Between.
There must be something wrong.

1:11:34.878 --> 1:11:36.964
I didn't think that was possible.

1:11:37.047 --> 1:11:38.924
Oh, no. Hazel!

1:11:51.144 --> 1:11:52.813
Hazel. No.

1:11:55.023 --> 1:11:56.024
No.

1:12:06.994 --> 1:12:08.662
The good luck stone!

1:12:08.745 --> 1:12:12.416
This can't be happening.
I need good luck to forge a new one.

1:12:12.499 --> 1:12:15.669
The clovers are shriveled.
The pigs cannot create good luck.

1:12:19.464 --> 1:12:20.549
What about the pennies?

1:12:24.845 --> 1:12:27.306
Just one lucky penny would be enough.

1:12:27.931 --> 1:12:30.100
They're all contaminated!

1:12:30.184 --> 1:12:31.518
Try this one.

1:12:33.645 --> 1:12:35.230
Is it lucky or not?

1:12:38.775 --> 1:12:39.985
Not.

1:12:41.695 --> 1:12:44.364
Wait. Why do you have that, boss?

1:12:44.448 --> 1:12:47.367
Does this mean you're not lucky?

1:12:48.994 --> 1:12:51.038
I was right all along.

1:12:51.121 --> 1:12:54.333
You're a liar and a thief.
I bet you're not even Scottish.

1:12:55.792 --> 1:12:57.294
I'm not.

1:12:57.377 --> 1:12:58.879
I'm English, actually.

1:12:59.838 --> 1:13:03.258
And I lived eight lives in bad luck
before I found that penny.

1:13:04.051 --> 1:13:06.512
It was the penny that made you lucky.

1:13:06.595 --> 1:13:07.721
Yes.

1:13:08.639 --> 1:13:10.474
I'm a bad luck black cat.

1:13:11.183 --> 1:13:12.392
And I always will be.

1:13:35.290 --> 1:13:36.542
What does that mean?

1:13:36.625 --> 1:13:40.671
The connection between the human world
and the luck world

1:13:40.754 --> 1:13:43.215
has been severed for good.

1:13:43.298 --> 1:13:46.426
But there must be a way to fix it!
To reconnect.

1:13:46.510 --> 1:13:50.138
Without good luck, there is no way.

1:13:50.222 --> 1:13:53.433
But I have to get to Hazel!
I have to go home.

1:13:56.562 --> 1:13:58.730
You're a human?

1:14:00.774 --> 1:14:04.653
Yes. And I have to go home.

1:14:05.237 --> 1:14:08.031
And what about our home, Sam?

1:14:09.408 --> 1:14:14.371
We exist to make luck for your world.
What will happen to us now?

1:14:20.627 --> 1:14:22.963
You should never have come here.

1:14:23.589 --> 1:14:26.008
She was only following me.

1:14:26.091 --> 1:14:29.136
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this.

1:14:29.219 --> 1:14:32.431
I was just trying to help my friend.

1:14:33.098 --> 1:14:35.058
And instead, you've made sure that she

1:14:35.142 --> 1:14:38.937
and no other humans
will ever experience luck again.

1:14:42.608 --> 1:14:45.444
We should just banish both
of them to Bad Luck.

1:14:46.445 --> 1:14:49.823
What does it matter?
It's all bad luck now.

1:14:52.284 --> 1:14:55.370
See, I knew there was something
off about you, Bob.

1:14:55.454 --> 1:14:58.123
I knew it deep in my soul.

1:14:58.207 --> 1:15:00.501
Only, I didn't stop you in time.

1:15:00.584 --> 1:15:03.587
And I have to live
with that for the rest of my life.

1:15:19.478 --> 1:15:21.396
I should've been better, Sam.

1:15:23.273 --> 1:15:25.901
I should've given you the penny
for your friend.

1:15:27.361 --> 1:15:30.364
If I had, none of this would've happened.

1:15:31.865 --> 1:15:37.037
But you were afraid I'd lose it
or flush it down another toilet.

1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:40.207
I was afraid to lose my lucky life.

1:15:40.916 --> 1:15:42.668
And too selfish to risk it.

1:15:43.293 --> 1:15:45.295
Well, you made the right choice.

1:15:45.921 --> 1:15:48.757
-I make things worse. It's what I do.
-Sam--

1:15:48.841 --> 1:15:51.552
You'd think
I would have learned my lesson by now.

1:15:51.635 --> 1:15:53.303
To just lay down for once,

1:15:53.387 --> 1:15:57.057
stop trying so hard,
stop sweating, like you said.

1:15:57.140 --> 1:15:58.725
I should never have said that.

1:15:58.809 --> 1:16:00.435
It's true.

1:16:00.519 --> 1:16:04.189
Even here, in the luckiest place
in the universe,

1:16:04.273 --> 1:16:07.484
I still found a way to screw it all up.

1:16:08.735 --> 1:16:10.404
And that's how I know.

1:16:10.487 --> 1:16:11.822
Know what?

1:16:11.905 --> 1:16:17.452
That it's not my bad luck
that's the problem. It's just me.

1:16:19.329 --> 1:16:22.541
And there's no amount of good luck
that can ever fix it.

1:16:22.624 --> 1:16:24.501
I don't believe that.

1:16:24.585 --> 1:16:26.128
Well you should.

1:16:26.211 --> 1:16:29.464
Not only did I doom Hazel, and you, and--

1:16:29.548 --> 1:16:33.927
and everyone else to a life of bad luck,
but now I can't get back to her.

1:16:34.469 --> 1:16:37.306
I'm just another adult
who broke another promise.

1:16:37.931 --> 1:16:40.851
The kind that leaves and doesn't stick.

1:16:41.810 --> 1:16:46.190
I swear,
she'd be better off if she never met me.

1:16:48.734 --> 1:16:50.444
Well, I wouldn't be better off.

1:16:51.153 --> 1:16:52.779
You're not bad, Sam.

1:16:53.697 --> 1:16:55.282
You're the opposite of bad,

1:16:55.866 --> 1:17:00.245
like some kind of pure goodness
I didn't think was possible for a human.

1:17:00.829 --> 1:17:05.250
Your first instinct is to share,
like the tasty meat bread.

1:17:05.334 --> 1:17:09.505
Or to help, even if helping might stop you
from getting what you want the most.

1:17:09.588 --> 1:17:14.551
And what's crazier is what you want
the most isn't even for you.

1:17:15.219 --> 1:17:18.639
You want good things for others in a way
that I can't comprehend,

1:17:18.722 --> 1:17:22.476
and you'll endure the worst bad luck ever
to make it happen.

1:17:24.144 --> 1:17:28.190
I was wrong to ever tell you not
to try because every time you do,

1:17:28.273 --> 1:17:31.693
you make things better.
And that's how I know.

1:17:32.778 --> 1:17:34.404
Know what?

1:17:34.488 --> 1:17:37.783
That your friend Hazel
doesn't need good luck.

1:17:37.866 --> 1:17:41.620
She's already the luckiest girl
in the world 'cause she has you.

1:17:43.288 --> 1:17:46.291
You said you wanted
to do something good with your life.

1:17:47.376 --> 1:17:48.919
You already have.

1:18:03.308 --> 1:18:05.310
I didn't mean to make you cry.

1:18:06.186 --> 1:18:09.273
Don't worry, Bob. It's a happy cry.

1:18:10.148 --> 1:18:13.569
Humans are so weird.

1:18:19.366 --> 1:18:21.410
There's gotta be a way to fix this!

1:18:21.493 --> 1:18:23.954
Yes, and get you back to Hazel.

1:18:24.580 --> 1:18:26.790
But fat chance of that happening.

1:18:26.874 --> 1:18:29.418
Unless you have some good luck hidden
in there, which--

1:18:29.501 --> 1:18:31.128
Wait. What did you say?

1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:34.089
"Unless you have some good luck hidden
in there"?

1:18:34.173 --> 1:18:36.091
-That's it.
-What is?

1:18:36.175 --> 1:18:38.135
There's good luck down in Bad Luck.

1:18:38.218 --> 1:18:39.845
How do you know that?

1:18:39.928 --> 1:18:41.221
Because I've seen it!

1:18:41.305 --> 1:18:45.017
And you're planning to go right back
down to Bad Luck and fetch it?

1:18:45.601 --> 1:18:47.811
-That's your plan?
-Bingo.

1:18:51.231 --> 1:18:53.108
Welcome back to the Land of Bad Luck.

1:18:53.692 --> 1:18:55.235
It's like I never left.

1:18:57.196 --> 1:19:01.325
The good luck is somewhere
between here in Dog Poop and the elevator.

1:19:01.825 --> 1:19:03.994
Okay, describe what you saw exactly.

1:19:04.077 --> 1:19:07.873
Monsters were gathered around
this green light that had to be good luck.

1:19:07.956 --> 1:19:09.291
And then a bell would ding,

1:19:09.374 --> 1:19:11.919
and they'd start shouting,
and there was fire and--

1:19:12.002 --> 1:19:14.087
-Fire?
-Yeah.

1:19:14.171 --> 1:19:16.215
It could only be one place.

1:19:19.885 --> 1:19:22.304
I must have come
in the back door last time.

1:19:24.973 --> 1:19:26.683
Wait! Don't go in yet!

1:19:31.021 --> 1:19:32.105
Bob.

1:19:36.693 --> 1:19:37.736
Hi.

1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:44.535
This is it.

1:19:47.079 --> 1:19:49.665
Bob? Is that you?

1:19:49.748 --> 1:19:51.792
Where the heck you been, brother?

1:19:51.875 --> 1:19:53.710
Hey, Rootie, how's it going?

1:19:53.794 --> 1:19:56.129
-It's Bob.
-Long time, no see.

1:19:56.213 --> 1:19:59.258
-Monsters, huh?
-You said monsters.

1:19:59.341 --> 1:20:02.427
I said roots and goblins, which they are.

1:20:02.511 --> 1:20:03.720
Hey, Bob.

1:20:04.680 --> 1:20:06.723
-And goats.
-How do they know you?

1:20:07.307 --> 1:20:09.393
I spent a couple of hours here.

1:20:09.476 --> 1:20:11.562
Yeah, try eight lifetimes.

1:20:11.645 --> 1:20:15.315
Just sitting here sipping
my famous tangerine tornado

1:20:15.399 --> 1:20:18.652
and talking about how if he could
just find a little good luck,

1:20:18.735 --> 1:20:20.362
he could finally be happy.

1:20:20.612 --> 1:20:22.322
We thought you were dead, Bob.

1:20:22.406 --> 1:20:25.367
Yeah, Rootie even retired your barstool.

1:20:25.450 --> 1:20:28.829
Wow, that's-- Thanks.

1:20:28.912 --> 1:20:30.747
But, yeah, not dead.

1:20:31.373 --> 1:20:34.209
Just looking for a little good luck,
like Rootie said.

1:20:34.626 --> 1:20:36.128
Where are my manners?

1:20:36.211 --> 1:20:39.381
I'm Rootie, the proprietor
of this tropical juice bar

1:20:39.464 --> 1:20:42.676
and the self-appointed mayor of Bad Luck.

1:20:44.219 --> 1:20:46.388
Nice to meet you, Rootie. I'm Sam.

1:20:46.471 --> 1:20:49.892
Hey, you're that leprechaun
who broke the elevator.

1:20:49.975 --> 1:20:52.811
Human actually, and yeah.
Sorry about that.

1:20:52.895 --> 1:20:55.898
Human, huh? Well, that's a first.

1:20:55.981 --> 1:20:58.650
Hey, Bob.
We'll get your stool down for ya.

1:21:01.820 --> 1:21:03.155
Duct tape, flying in!

1:21:03.989 --> 1:21:06.533
Don't worry about it, guys.
We can't stick around.

1:21:06.617 --> 1:21:09.077
-We need your help.
-Name it. What's going on?

1:21:09.161 --> 1:21:12.247
Well, the luck lines have detached,
the Randomizer is broken,

1:21:12.331 --> 1:21:15.250
and we're floating off into the void
with no real purpose to exist.

1:21:15.334 --> 1:21:17.586
We thought we just short-circuited a wire.

1:21:17.669 --> 1:21:19.963
We didn't realize we had broken
the whole world.

1:21:20.047 --> 1:21:21.798
It wasn't you guys. It was us.

1:21:21.882 --> 1:21:25.010
Something broke, and it wasn't our fault?
Amen, brother.

1:21:26.553 --> 1:21:28.180
But there might still be a way to fix it.

1:21:28.263 --> 1:21:30.724
When I was here before,
I saw a green light,

1:21:30.807 --> 1:21:33.185
which I'm really hoping is good luck.

1:21:33.268 --> 1:21:36.355
Oh, yeah, we've got some.
It's in the Lucky Shot.

1:21:37.022 --> 1:21:38.023
Lucky Shot?

1:21:46.156 --> 1:21:48.033
Yeah! Way to go, Stinky!

1:21:48.909 --> 1:21:50.327
All right, follow me.

1:21:52.371 --> 1:21:53.747
Happened after you left, Bob.

1:21:53.830 --> 1:21:57.167
I was out fixing cracks
when I backed into this pipe

1:21:57.251 --> 1:21:59.211
and a little good luck floated out.

1:21:59.878 --> 1:22:03.966
So I gathered it up and dropped it
straight into the Lucky Shot.

1:22:04.049 --> 1:22:07.052
Figured that way everybody
could experience a little good luck.

1:22:07.135 --> 1:22:09.429
-You know what I mean?
-But what about them?

1:22:09.638 --> 1:22:10.639
You're kidding?

1:22:11.515 --> 1:22:13.892
They'll just find
something else to rally around.

1:22:13.976 --> 1:22:17.062
It's one of the benefits of bad luck.
It teaches you to pivot.

1:22:17.145 --> 1:22:19.439
I never really thought about it that way.

1:22:23.443 --> 1:22:25.946
-Come on!
-Something must be broken.

1:22:26.029 --> 1:22:27.030
Bummer.

1:22:28.532 --> 1:22:30.868
Okay. Frisbee golf, anyone?

1:22:30.951 --> 1:22:32.327
See what I'm saying?

1:22:32.411 --> 1:22:34.246
And once you've fixed the Randomizer,

1:22:34.329 --> 1:22:37.165
I have no doubt, one day,
I'll find some more.

1:22:37.791 --> 1:22:41.378
Thank you, Rootie.
And we'll need some bad luck dust too.

1:22:41.461 --> 1:22:43.755
Have at it. Plenty of that around.

1:22:43.839 --> 1:22:46.550
And if you could use our help up there,
just say the word.

1:22:46.633 --> 1:22:47.676
Word.

1:22:47.759 --> 1:22:49.553
Well, giddy up!

1:22:49.636 --> 1:22:51.638
We gotta get this to the Dragon.

1:22:51.722 --> 1:22:55.392
She won't be happy to see us.
We just wrecked her world.

1:22:56.310 --> 1:22:59.229
I think we know someone
she will be happy to see.

1:23:07.196 --> 1:23:10.032
How could I miss that she was a human?

1:23:10.699 --> 1:23:12.993
A tall leprechaun?

1:23:13.076 --> 1:23:15.037
How dare they show up here?

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:16.580
Who is it?

1:23:16.663 --> 1:23:20.375
It's Bob, the girl and a unicorn.

1:23:20.459 --> 1:23:21.668
Jeff?

1:23:24.671 --> 1:23:27.841
Guter Kummer,
I don't remember it being that tough.

1:23:27.925 --> 1:23:30.093
Of course, last time I was a stallion.

1:23:30.177 --> 1:23:32.554
It has been a hundred years.

1:23:34.097 --> 1:23:37.809
Schön dich zu sehen, Babe.

1:23:37.893 --> 1:23:39.561
Heimdall.

1:23:40.812 --> 1:23:42.856
You got a lot of nerve coming here.

1:23:42.940 --> 1:23:44.608
Hear them out, Babe.

1:23:44.691 --> 1:23:48.529
A little good luck.
It might be enough to fix the Randomizer.

1:23:48.612 --> 1:23:49.780
Where did it come from?

1:23:49.863 --> 1:23:51.114
Bad Luck.

1:23:51.198 --> 1:23:55.369
Somehow it made its way down there,
and they were kind enough to share.

1:23:55.452 --> 1:23:58.080
We need you to forge two new stones.

1:23:58.163 --> 1:23:59.831
Just like when you made this.

1:24:01.625 --> 1:24:03.085
You still have it.

1:24:03.168 --> 1:24:04.628
I never took it off.

1:24:06.839 --> 1:24:10.092
Your ancient dragon flames
have the power, Babe.

1:24:10.175 --> 1:24:12.928
I trust you remember how
to wield your burning hot Feuer?

1:24:13.011 --> 1:24:14.930
Was that a dare?

1:24:22.229 --> 1:24:24.439
Let's see if I've still got it.

1:24:44.001 --> 1:24:45.043
Was ist das?

1:24:45.127 --> 1:24:47.588
You said you needed two stones. Voilà!

1:24:47.671 --> 1:24:49.548
But you made three.

1:24:49.631 --> 1:24:51.675
The bad luck stone was just a warm-up.

1:24:51.758 --> 1:24:54.845
And these are for the Randomizer.

1:24:54.928 --> 1:24:57.431
Have you lost your brain marbles, Babe?

1:24:57.514 --> 1:25:00.559
Because you know very well
that das Randomizer needs a good luck

1:25:00.642 --> 1:25:02.019
and a bad luck stone.

1:25:02.102 --> 1:25:05.522
Does it though? Two stones, sure.

1:25:05.606 --> 1:25:07.941
But show me where it says
they can't both be lucky.

1:25:08.734 --> 1:25:11.236
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1:25:11.653 --> 1:25:15.157
With these two stones,
we can eliminate bad luck

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:19.161
and all that goes with it.
The frustration, the loneliness, the--

1:25:19.244 --> 1:25:21.747
-Wait. But--
-You said it yourself, Sam.

1:25:21.830 --> 1:25:25.209
Without bad luck,
your world could look just like ours.

1:25:26.418 --> 1:25:27.961
Toodle-oo!

1:25:54.279 --> 1:25:55.614
Down to go up.

1:26:12.214 --> 1:26:14.675
I can't let you
place two good luck stones.

1:26:14.758 --> 1:26:18.595
Nonsense.
Good luck for everyone all the time.

1:26:18.679 --> 1:26:21.056
We can make that happen, Sam.

1:26:21.139 --> 1:26:23.642
You, of all people, should want that.

1:26:23.725 --> 1:26:27.563
I know bad luck can be terrible,
especially when it keeps coming.

1:26:27.646 --> 1:26:31.024
-But we still need it.
-Need it?

1:26:31.108 --> 1:26:35.028
The only thing bad luck ever did for me
was break my world and break my heart.

1:26:35.612 --> 1:26:37.948
No. It was me who broke your world.

1:26:39.449 --> 1:26:43.036
It's Bad Luck that's here
helping put it back together.

1:26:43.871 --> 1:26:46.498
-Hey, these things happen.
-Not here.

1:26:46.582 --> 1:26:49.042
-There we go.
-Don't worry.

1:26:54.298 --> 1:26:57.009
I know you're afraid to let bad luck in.

1:26:57.092 --> 1:27:00.888
You think it's the reason you're alone.
I did too.

1:27:00.971 --> 1:27:04.433
I blamed bad luck for everything
that went wrong in my life.

1:27:04.516 --> 1:27:09.605
But coming here, I realized that
it also made some things go very right.

1:27:09.688 --> 1:27:14.067
Without my bad luck,
I wouldn't have met Hazel or Bob.

1:27:15.819 --> 1:27:18.822
And you would've never met
the love of your life.

1:27:18.906 --> 1:27:20.199
What are you talking about?

1:27:20.282 --> 1:27:23.994
You only met Jeff
because he'd been doused by bad luck.

1:27:24.077 --> 1:27:26.205
Which means, it didn't tear you apart.

1:27:26.288 --> 1:27:28.749
Bad luck brought you together
in the first place.

1:27:30.792 --> 1:27:33.170
You think your creatures
can't endure bad luck,

1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:37.257
but they can, and they will.

1:27:46.892 --> 1:27:48.435
And so can you.

1:27:48.519 --> 1:27:52.648
You don't have to fear bad luck
because you have each other.

1:27:54.358 --> 1:27:57.569
And that makes you
the luckiest creatures I know.

1:28:01.949 --> 1:28:05.953
Why, if good and bad luck can
at long last live side by side,

1:28:06.954 --> 1:28:08.830
then I would love nothing more.

1:28:09.831 --> 1:28:12.668
Far be it from me
to take all the mystery out of life.

1:28:12.751 --> 1:28:14.461
Both it is.

1:28:22.427 --> 1:28:23.262
Sam!

1:28:45.576 --> 1:28:49.454
We lucky ladies of stature
oughta stick together, don't you think?

1:28:49.538 --> 1:28:50.581
Oh, yes.

1:28:56.503 --> 1:28:57.713
Thank you, Sam.

1:30:28.887 --> 1:30:32.474
All right!
One bad-break banana banshee coming down.

1:30:34.893 --> 1:30:35.936
Sorry, Root.

1:30:36.019 --> 1:30:40.482
No problem, Fred.
You know I always make two, just in case.

1:30:40.566 --> 1:30:42.150
What was that?

1:30:49.825 --> 1:30:51.618
We miss you already.

1:30:51.702 --> 1:30:53.537
-"We"?
-Sam!

1:30:55.038 --> 1:30:56.790
-Sam. Bob.
-Hey, Rootie.

1:30:56.874 --> 1:30:59.251
-Good Luck in Bad Luck.
-And Hairy Lemon.

1:30:59.334 --> 1:31:02.087
Now, this is a good-looking juice bar.

1:31:02.171 --> 1:31:05.340
Yeah. First tropical juice bar
in the Land of Luck.

1:31:05.424 --> 1:31:09.178
We come bearing gifts.
Or, well, gift rather.

1:31:09.261 --> 1:31:10.971
It's for the Lucky Shot.

1:31:12.723 --> 1:31:15.309
She sure is a beauty.

1:31:15.392 --> 1:31:18.770
It's a small token of thanks
for coming to our aid.

1:31:18.854 --> 1:31:20.772
It was our pleasure, Ms. The Dragon.

1:31:20.856 --> 1:31:23.817
And we sure do appreciate you dropping
in for a visit.

1:31:23.901 --> 1:31:25.986
I should have come long ago.

1:31:26.069 --> 1:31:30.908
Und we have our unlucky Freund Sam
to thank for bringing us all together.

1:31:30.991 --> 1:31:32.492
Way to go, Latvia!

1:31:32.576 --> 1:31:35.287
Latvia!

1:31:35.370 --> 1:31:38.248
Sam!

1:31:38.332 --> 1:31:40.125
Speaking of my bad luck,

1:31:40.209 --> 1:31:44.588
I'd like to thank you guys
for sending it all my way.

1:31:44.671 --> 1:31:49.635
The flat tires, the toast jam-side-down,
the keys in the sewer.

1:31:49.718 --> 1:31:51.011
Hey, that was me!

1:31:52.221 --> 1:31:58.310
It wasn't all fun,
but I wouldn't change a single thing.

1:31:58.894 --> 1:32:01.438
Fire her up. What do you say, Sam?

1:32:06.944 --> 1:32:09.821
-Take a shot, Bob.
-Come on, Bob!

1:32:19.540 --> 1:32:23.418
Hey! So, what do you say, Bob?
Ready to come home?

1:32:23.502 --> 1:32:25.587
Sounds like the guys
got your barstool fixed

1:32:25.671 --> 1:32:27.506
and ready for your little cat butt.

1:32:28.465 --> 1:32:29.466
Thanks, guys.

1:32:29.550 --> 1:32:32.135
Well, we were actually hoping
Bob might stay in Good Luck.

1:32:32.219 --> 1:32:33.804
The Captain said
you could have your job back.

1:32:33.887 --> 1:32:39.101
Yeah, despite your growing rap sheet,
Gerry claims you're a good line cat.

1:32:39.184 --> 1:32:40.811
So, come on back.

1:32:41.520 --> 1:32:45.190
And we made you this,
your very own lucky penny.

1:32:46.108 --> 1:32:47.109
Wow.

1:32:47.860 --> 1:32:51.280
A lucky life
just like you always wanted, Bob.

1:32:51.363 --> 1:32:52.656
I'm so happy for you.

1:32:54.116 --> 1:32:55.659
Good for you, Bob.

1:32:57.494 --> 1:33:00.914
Thanks, Captain, but I can't accept.

1:33:00.998 --> 1:33:02.916
-Boss?
-Bob?

1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:05.127
You're all better friends than I deserve.

1:33:05.752 --> 1:33:06.879
Well, that's true.

1:33:08.088 --> 1:33:12.134
Especially you, Gerry.
And friends we will stay.

1:33:12.801 --> 1:33:16.263
But as for where I live out
the rest of my days--

1:33:17.431 --> 1:33:21.768
If I can, I'd like to spend them with Sam,
in her world.

1:33:25.564 --> 1:33:27.983
Be your forever family?

1:33:29.818 --> 1:33:33.530
Me and you, a forever family?

1:33:34.865 --> 1:33:36.116
I'd really love that.

1:33:45.167 --> 1:33:47.836
You realize you're hugging me, right?

1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:51.131
Yes. And you better get used to it.

1:33:51.215 --> 1:33:53.008
Juice drinks on the house!

1:33:56.136 --> 1:34:00.974
Yes, ma'am. Heat it up.
We're gonna call that the Lucky Dragon.

1:34:07.314 --> 1:34:10.526
Mini palm tree. Some bulk beans.

1:34:10.609 --> 1:34:12.027
I'm making bean bags,

1:34:12.110 --> 1:34:15.113
and I thought a mix might be nice,
you know, in your hand.

1:34:16.156 --> 1:34:21.370
And one soap-on-a-rope
brings your total to $13.57.

1:34:21.453 --> 1:34:24.248
Let me just find my credit card.

1:34:26.416 --> 1:34:28.252
-Found my card!
-Great.

1:34:28.877 --> 1:34:30.420
Here you go, Ms. Charles.

1:34:31.588 --> 1:34:33.966
Hey, I got this,
Sam the manager.

1:34:34.049 --> 1:34:35.175
Bless you, Marvin.

1:34:36.593 --> 1:34:39.137
-Have a great time!
-See you Monday!

1:34:39.221 --> 1:34:41.014
I should never
have gotten you a cell phone.

1:34:41.098 --> 1:34:44.768
I can't stop. I'm sorry. I have a problem.
I was born to thumb-type.

1:34:44.852 --> 1:34:47.145
Map says nine minutes,
but we'll take the shortcut.

1:34:56.613 --> 1:34:57.948
They're here!

1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:04.246
Sam!

1:35:06.832 --> 1:35:09.918
-Come here, Bob.
-I say, Hazel. This is a tight one.

1:35:10.002 --> 1:35:12.504
Hi, Sam. Hi, Bob.

1:35:14.715 --> 1:35:15.716
Sit.

1:35:15.799 --> 1:35:18.302
Good work, Bingo. Who's your master?

1:35:18.385 --> 1:35:23.891
Who's your master? That's right.
Bob is. Bob is your master.

1:35:25.058 --> 1:35:27.060
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

1:35:28.061 --> 1:35:29.897
She's just a little excited.

1:35:29.980 --> 1:35:31.231
Yeah, me too.

1:35:31.315 --> 1:35:33.609
Hazel's really lucky she found you guys.

1:35:33.692 --> 1:35:35.652
I'm pretty sure we're the lucky ones.

1:35:37.529 --> 1:35:40.532
And we'll see you here
for dinner on Sunday! Five o'clock.

1:35:40.616 --> 1:35:42.284
We're having Bob's favorite.

1:35:42.367 --> 1:35:43.410
We'll be here.

1:35:43.493 --> 1:35:45.787
You hear that, Bob? Paninis on Sunday.

1:35:45.871 --> 1:35:47.998
Tasty meat bread.

1:35:48.081 --> 1:35:49.082
Bingo.

1:35:49.374 --> 1:35:50.375
Not you!

1:35:55.464 --> 1:35:58.217
My new life is nothing
like the one I pictured.

1:35:59.092 --> 1:36:00.177
It's better.

1:36:02.304 --> 1:36:05.474
Things don't always go as planned,
of course.

1:36:05.557 --> 1:36:08.560
Unless, well, you plan for them.

1:36:17.486 --> 1:36:22.282
In the end, you might say that bad luck
led me to the luckiest thing in the world.

1:36:22.950 --> 1:36:24.785
Or was it good luck?

1:36:25.369 --> 1:36:28.664
Whatever it was,
I found my forever family.

1:36:29.373 --> 1:36:32.668
The kind that doesn't leave. They stick.

1:36:32.751 --> 1:36:36.213
And I'd do it all over again to get here.
