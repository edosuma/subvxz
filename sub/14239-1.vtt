00:38.379 --> 00:40.580
Ooh, sweetheart.
Haven't got enough, you didn't order.

00:40.615 --> 00:43.379
Well, I've only
just arrived, so tough.

00:43.414 --> 00:45.784
Well, what do I do now?

00:45.819 --> 00:48.180
Who is it? Dunno, some bloke.

00:50.620 --> 00:52.859
You going to Slimbo's on Friday?

00:52.894 --> 00:54.544
What is it, drinks?

00:54.579 --> 00:56.619
Bit of a pizza, I think.
Might do, yeah.

00:59.380 --> 01:01.059
What's happening there, then?

01:07.020 --> 01:12.420
Move back, if you could, thank you. Back you
go, that's it, back you go. What's going on?

01:13.899 --> 01:15.744
What's happening?

01:15.779 --> 01:17.385
Buggered if I know.
It's orders from above.

01:17.420 --> 01:20.820
But the body's still in there though,
isn't it? We can't just leave it.

01:20.855 --> 01:22.419
Move back, they said, clear the site.

01:22.454 --> 01:24.059
Special access, they said.

01:24.094 --> 01:25.940
For who? Torchwood.

01:46.220 --> 01:49.100
Who's Torchwood?
Special ops or something.

01:49.135 --> 01:51.264
Is that hot? Er, yeah.

01:51.299 --> 01:55.179
They're not allowed in, they could
contaminate the evidence. How come...?

01:55.214 --> 01:57.620
Don't ask me,
there's no procedure any more.

01:57.655 --> 01:59.619
It's a fucking disgrace.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.339
There you go. I can taste it.

02:43.374 --> 02:46.179
Oestrogen, definitely oestrogen.

02:47.660 --> 02:52.619
You take the Pill, flush it away, it
enters the water cycle, feminises the fish,

02:52.654 --> 02:57.579
goes all the way up into the sky, then
falls all the way back down on to me.

02:57.614 --> 03:01.299
Contraceptives in the rain.

03:01.334 --> 03:03.104
Love this planet.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.700
Still, at least I won't get pregnant.

03:05.735 --> 03:07.500
Never doing that again.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.465
How's it going?

03:09.500 --> 03:15.819
Nothing yet. It's got to connect, I've just got
to feel it. Hurry up! I'm freezing my arse off.

03:15.854 --> 03:20.699
I can't just flick a switch,
it's more like it grants me access.

03:20.734 --> 03:25.144
Whatever that means.
It's like... Oh, oh, oh!

03:25.179 --> 03:29.059
Positions. If I get punched again,
I'm punching it right back.

03:29.094 --> 03:31.220
Just, concentrate. Suzie?

03:48.180 --> 03:50.385
There was... What was?

03:50.420 --> 03:53.984
I was..
Oh, my God, I was going home.

03:54.019 --> 03:59.820
Listen to me, we've only got two minutes so it's
important that you listen, OK? Who are you? Trust me.

03:59.855 --> 04:03.985
You're dead. How am I dead? You were
stabbed. I'm not dead, I can see you.

04:04.020 --> 04:08.940
We've brought you back but we haven't got long, I'm
sorry but you've got to concentrate, who did this to you?

04:08.975 --> 04:11.619
What did you see? Why am I dead?
Who attacked you?

04:11.654 --> 04:13.864
I don't want to be dead.
Sixty seconds.

04:13.899 --> 04:19.939
You've got to think, just focus on me. What
was the last thing you saw? I didn't see...

04:19.974 --> 04:22.677
I don't know.
Who killed you, did you see them?

04:22.712 --> 04:25.345
I don't know.
There was... something behind me.

04:25.380 --> 04:30.580
Police said one stab wound in the
back. So you didn't see anything? No.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.504
What happens now?

04:36.539 --> 04:39.899
Thirty seconds. But he didn't
see anyone. Don't waste it.

04:39.934 --> 04:42.540
What else do I say?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.505
What's your name?

04:45.540 --> 04:49.100
John. John Tucker. OK, John.

04:50.939 --> 04:54.900
Not long now. Who are you?
Captain Jack Harkness. Tell me...

04:54.935 --> 04:57.379
what was it like when you died?
What did you see?

04:59.499 --> 05:01.024
John.

05:01.059 --> 05:03.619
Tell me what you saw.

05:03.654 --> 05:05.824
Ten seconds.

05:05.859 --> 05:09.540
Nothing. I saw nothing.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.020
Oh, my God. There's nothing.

05:19.619 --> 05:21.745
Shit.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.699
I said it was stupid, telling
him he was dead. Well, you try it.

05:24.734 --> 05:26.745
"Trust me", like that's gonna work.

05:26.780 --> 05:32.940
Told the last corpse he was injured, he wasted
the whole two minutes screaming for an ambulance.

05:32.975 --> 05:35.940
Maybe there's no right way
of doing it.

05:35.975 --> 05:37.460
What do you think?

06:23.340 --> 06:26.460
You still up?

06:26.495 --> 06:27.945
In here.

06:27.980 --> 06:32.380
They said on the news, murder in the
city centre, were you there?

06:33.459 --> 06:35.744
No, I dunno, nothing to do with me.

06:35.779 --> 06:39.559
How come you're still up though?
Banana Boat came round.

06:39.594 --> 06:43.340
He was saying he's got plans,
he's off again next summer.

06:43.375 --> 06:45.579
How come you're not pissed then?

06:45.614 --> 06:47.544
No, we had a cup of tea.

06:47.579 --> 06:50.459
He's read this thing about diabetes.

06:50.494 --> 06:53.145
Me and him having tea,

06:53.180 --> 06:57.039
that's middle age, that is.
There's some Chinese in the fridge.

06:57.074 --> 07:00.899
No, I'm knackered. You coming
to bed? I'll just finish here.

07:00.934 --> 07:03.540
This man's found his sister.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.980
I'll see you in a minute.

07:30.499 --> 07:34.504
Von, can you do a search for me?
Oh, join the queue.

07:34.539 --> 07:38.420
It's a Captain Jack Harkness. Could you check
him out? I'm busy. There's proper channels, Gwen.

07:38.455 --> 07:43.980
What sort of Captain? Don't know. Just
Captain. If I've got time. Thanks! If!

07:44.015 --> 07:48.137
Sarah Pallister, 72,
murdered in her front room.

07:48.172 --> 07:52.225
Rani Ghosh, 45,
murdered in Robintree Alley.

07:52.260 --> 07:56.864
And now John Tucker, 19,
murdered in Llangyfelach Lane.

07:56.899 --> 08:01.620
So far, there's absolutely nothing linking these
three victims, apart from the way they died.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.105
As far as we can tell,
all with the same weapon.

08:04.140 --> 08:07.345
A blade, approximately eight
inches long, three inches deep.

08:07.380 --> 08:12.579
The women were stabbed from the front, but Tucker
from behind. What does that tell us about the killer?

08:12.614 --> 08:14.179
That he's a coward.

08:15.740 --> 08:19.620
But those people last night, the
people in the car, who were they?

08:19.655 --> 08:22.299
What's Torchwood?
Dunno, special ops.

08:22.334 --> 08:23.904
Yeah, but what does that mean?

08:23.939 --> 08:29.780
Bet you ten quid they're DNA specialists, it's
all DNA these days, like that CSI bollocks.

08:29.815 --> 08:31.704
CSI Cardiff, I'd like to see that.

08:31.739 --> 08:34.659
They'd be measuring
the velocity of a kebab.

08:37.940 --> 08:41.019
Thank you Break it up!

09:42.260 --> 09:43.899
DOOR SLAMS

09:45.499 --> 09:50.385
Excuse me. It's all sealed off
up there. Who did that?

09:50.420 --> 09:54.304
Thought it was you lot.
But what's it for, what's happened?

09:54.339 --> 09:58.140
9am, it was all sealed off, they
never said. Chemicals or something.

10:09.099 --> 10:10.619
Hello?

10:18.219 --> 10:20.580
Sorry, I'm just looking for someone.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.820
Right, yeah. Clever.

10:39.060 --> 10:43.220
Anyway, I don't know if you
saw a man come through here -

10:43.255 --> 10:47.380
a tall man, in one of those
big sort of military coats.

10:54.660 --> 10:59.380
OK. If you could answer?
This is official business.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.860
You all right?

11:07.619 --> 11:12.945
That's good.
That's a good mask sort of thing.

11:12.980 --> 11:17.780
Look, I'm sorry if I'm
interrupting something, but...

11:17.815 --> 11:20.305
I think we can stop this now, OK?

11:20.340 --> 11:25.499
It's all very well playing silly
buggers, but I'm busy, all right?

11:27.100 --> 11:30.219
Now, I'm looking for a man
in a big grey coat.

11:32.579 --> 11:35.744
I said we can stop being silly.

11:35.779 --> 11:42.345
Ah, there you are, I did ask when I saw Dr
Mahib cos I thought it was him who said about

11:42.380 --> 11:46.540
the police, but he said no, then I said about the
chemicals but he said don't be stupid, what chemicals?

11:46.575 --> 11:50.700
So I don't know, could be anything, who've you got
with you there then? So much for sealing it off.

11:50.735 --> 11:53.584
Ooh, there's a face!

11:53.619 --> 11:59.180
Nice one. Hey, I tell you mate, you should
try plastic surgery. Not on the NHS mind!

11:59.215 --> 12:02.265
You all right? Yeah.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.620
Bloody hell, that is brilliant.

12:05.655 --> 12:08.905
That's like, em, Hellraiser.

12:08.940 --> 12:13.580
That's first class, that is. Look at
that, it's just like real teeth.

12:17.979 --> 12:21.019
Go! Go! Go!

12:48.220 --> 12:50.259
CAR ENGINE REVS

13:13.140 --> 13:20.025
Registration - Charlie Foxtrot
Zero Six Foxtrot Delta Uniform.

13:20.060 --> 13:24.860
Charlie Foxtrot Zero Six Foxtrot Delta
Uniform. Hold on. I think Yvonne wants a word.

13:24.895 --> 13:26.957
No sign of a Captain Jack Harkness.

13:26.992 --> 13:28.985
Did you search outside Cardiff?

13:29.020 --> 13:32.545
No, that never occurred to me
Of course I did. I went nationwide.

13:32.580 --> 13:37.779
There's about 15 Jacks and Johns with that surname,
none of them's a captain. He could've made it up.

13:37.814 --> 13:40.704
The only Captain Jack Harkness
on record was American.

13:40.739 --> 13:45.544
That's it, he's American! Which
you forgot to tell me. So who is he?

13:45.579 --> 13:48.500
American volunteer, Royal Air Force,
133 Squadron. Except he disappeared.

13:48.535 --> 13:51.740
Vanished off the records.
Presumed dead. When was that?

13:51.775 --> 13:53.745
1941. At the height of the Blitz.

13:53.780 --> 13:59.099
On the morning of January 211941, Captain
Jack Harkness failed to report for duty,

13:59.134 --> 14:01.305
never seen again, till now.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.620
What's going on, Gwen,
you seeing ghosts?

14:20.419 --> 14:22.579
You lot! Oi!

14:22.614 --> 14:24.704
Torchwood!

14:24.739 --> 14:29.900
You can't leave that there. Police. I can see
that, love, and you're still not leaving it there.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.779
I'm talking to you. Excuse me!

14:34.814 --> 14:36.380
Move your bloody car...

14:46.619 --> 14:49.580
Did you get anything
on that registration?

14:49.615 --> 14:51.784
No such number.

14:51.819 --> 14:53.584
What does that mean?

14:53.619 --> 14:58.740
Doesn't exist. Double checked with Swansea,
triple-checked, there's nothing, no such vehicle.

14:58.775 --> 15:01.860
But Temple's been asking about
you, Gwen. Are you in trouble?

15:05.100 --> 15:06.705
I have walked.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.020
I have bloody walked.

15:10.980 --> 15:13.864
They were here,
and then they were gone.

15:13.899 --> 15:17.100
And look, there's nowhere to hide.
They just disappeared.

15:17.135 --> 15:19.860
Temple's not just livid,
he's doing his nut.

15:22.020 --> 15:28.579
There was a man, I'm telling you, there was
this porter, he was in a porter's uniform,

15:28.614 --> 15:31.545
and he was killed,
or at least he was injured,

15:31.580 --> 15:37.539
he must've been injured, right in front of me,
this man in a mask, sort of lashed out, and...

15:37.574 --> 15:42.339
And I've told you, all
hospital staff, present and correct.

15:44.860 --> 15:49.460
I saw it. That's it? Gwen, sweetheart,
think about it, what sort of story is that?

15:50.540 --> 15:53.619
You're not well. Come with me.
I'll take you home.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.100
They were here. Come on.

16:13.100 --> 16:16.665
Look at me! Hot pot!

16:16.700 --> 16:19.744
Or, as the French call it, ho po.

16:19.779 --> 16:23.700
Oh, I should've phoned.
I've got to work.

16:23.735 --> 16:25.664
You should be off sick.

16:25.699 --> 16:28.779
I know, but they were short
and there's a match on tonight,

16:28.814 --> 16:31.939
so I said I'd take another shift.
I'm sorry.

16:31.974 --> 16:34.384
Forgive me.

16:34.419 --> 16:38.700
Go on, forgive me. Say you
forgive me, you do, don't you?

16:40.980 --> 16:43.340
OK I got to go.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.465
Excuse me, Gwen Cooper, CID.

17:31.500 --> 17:36.500
I'm making some enquiries round the Bay. I need to
check some people out on your list, if that's OK.

17:36.535 --> 17:39.980
I don't suppose you deliver
to a Captain Jack Harkness?

17:40.015 --> 17:42.699
I dunno.
Well, could you have a look?

17:44.219 --> 17:46.065
Nope.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.400
He's not a regular anyway.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.700
J Harkness? Or just Harkness?

17:57.140 --> 17:58.144
No.

17:58.179 --> 18:01.300
OK. Never mind. Thanks anyway.

18:03.099 --> 18:08.700
I don't suppose you've got a Torchwood? Oh, aye,
we do them all the time. They're good customers.

18:39.459 --> 18:47.139
Oh, hiya. Sorry I'm late. Someone ordered pizza.
Who's it for? I think it's a... Mr Harkness.

18:58.260 --> 18:59.940
Don't keep them waiting.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.225
SHE LAUGHS

21:07.260 --> 21:09.080
I can't do this, I'm sorry.

21:09.115 --> 21:10.865
I'm rubbish. I give up!

21:10.900 --> 21:15.020
He set me off. Well, that lasted
nought point two seconds.

21:15.055 --> 21:17.745
She's actually carrying pizza!

21:17.780 --> 21:22.740
Come on! She was gonna say, "Here's your pizza,"
and I was going to say, "How much?" and she says,

21:22.775 --> 21:24.904
"Oh, whatever, twenty quid,"

21:24.939 --> 21:29.140
and I say, "Oh, I don't have any
money. " I was working on a punchline.

21:29.175 --> 21:31.985
I'd have got there.
But it would've been good!

21:32.020 --> 21:35.305
There's your pizza. I'd better go.
We've gone past that stage.

21:35.340 --> 21:39.899
You must've been freezing out there. How long were
you walking around? Three hours? You could see me?

21:39.934 --> 21:44.540
And before we go any further, who the hell
orders pizza under the name of Torchwood?

21:44.575 --> 21:48.384
Me. I'm sorry. I'm a twat.

21:48.419 --> 21:54.464
That man, at the hospital,
that porter, what happened to him?

21:54.499 --> 22:00.145
That was real, wasn't it? He was attacked.
He's dead. But there's no-one gone missing.

22:00.180 --> 22:05.660
We took the body, changed the work rota, planted
a false witness who saw him leaving the hospital,

22:05.695 --> 22:08.224
giving him an alibi
for the next 48 hours,

22:08.259 --> 22:12.819
so when his body's pulled out of the docks next
Tuesday night, he's only been missing for three days.

22:12.854 --> 22:16.299
He was murdered? Yes. And you
covered it up? That's my job.

22:19.060 --> 22:24.060
And that other man, John Tucker? Last night in
the alleyway, I saw you. And what did you see?

22:24.095 --> 22:26.785
You revived him. No.

22:26.820 --> 22:29.739
What did you see?
You resuscitated him.

22:29.774 --> 22:33.424
No, what did you see?

22:33.459 --> 22:36.780
You brought him back to life. Yeah.

22:38.499 --> 22:40.225
Who are you?

22:40.260 --> 22:44.980
Torchwood. What's Torchwood?
This is Torchwood.

22:45.015 --> 22:47.865
All around you.

22:47.900 --> 22:52.820
And what happens to me? I'm police.
Constable Gwen Cooper.

22:52.855 --> 22:55.259
You can't do anything.

22:56.060 --> 22:59.420
Right then, PC Cooper...

23:01.340 --> 23:03.860
.. d'you want to come see?

23:03.895 --> 23:06.380
See what? You saw the murder.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.980
Come and see the murderer.

23:14.580 --> 23:16.859
Go with him.

23:19.980 --> 23:25.340
What is Torchwood? Who are you?
What is this place? SCREECHING

23:25.375 --> 23:27.780
What was that? Pterodactyl.

23:27.815 --> 23:30.779
Are you coming?

23:50.140 --> 23:55.299
It's all right -
it's safe, it's sedated.

23:58.659 --> 24:00.985
It's called a Weevil.

24:01.020 --> 24:03.184
Or at least, we call them Weevils.

24:03.219 --> 24:07.065
We don't know their real name, cos
they're not too good at communicating.

24:07.100 --> 24:12.860
But we've got a couple of hundred of them in
the city living in the sewers, feeding off the...

24:12.895 --> 24:15.219
Well, it's the sewers,

24:15.254 --> 24:16.985
you can guess.

24:17.020 --> 24:22.539
But every once in a while, one of them
goes rogue, comes to the surface, attacks.

24:22.574 --> 24:27.180
Actually, it's been happening more
and more and we have no idea why.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.897
But it's alien.

24:29.932 --> 24:32.579
Look into its eyes.

24:43.539 --> 24:45.539
There you go.

24:49.059 --> 24:50.620
Take your time.

24:55.459 --> 24:57.659
It was born on a different world

24:57.694 --> 24:59.540
and it's real.

25:06.580 --> 25:09.999
Owen Harper, Gwen Cooper.
"Doctor" Owen Harper, thank you.

25:10.034 --> 25:13.384
Toshiko Sato, Suzie Costello,
she's second-in-command.

25:13.419 --> 25:21.140
And this is lanto Jones, lanto cleans up after
us and gets us everywhere on time. I try my best.

25:21.175 --> 25:24.620
And he looks good in a suit.
Careful, that's harassment, sir.

25:24.655 --> 25:26.824
Why are you telling me their names?

25:26.859 --> 25:31.860
I'm not supposed to know, am I? This is
classified, isn't it? Way beyond classified.

25:31.895 --> 25:35.305
Then you shouldn't be telling me.
What are you gonna do to me?

25:35.340 --> 25:40.739
What d'you imagine? Well, I've seen too much.
Your names and everything, and the Weevil, and...

25:40.774 --> 25:43.945
You can dump a man in the water
and lie about his death.

25:43.980 --> 25:50.140
OK! Tosh, finish that calibration tomorrow morning.
Owen, first thing, get a hold of Chandler and Bell,

25:50.175 --> 25:55.344
cos I think they're lying. lanto, if he needs
back-up, then you'd better be on stand-by. Suzie,

25:55.379 --> 26:00.939
I know it's a pain in the ass, but I need the costing
on the glove research, and you're coming with me.

26:03.339 --> 26:06.879
I'm getting tired of following you.

26:06.914 --> 26:10.420
No you're not, and you never will.

26:11.940 --> 26:15.259
Stand on here. C'mon, next to me.

26:15.294 --> 26:16.540
Good night!

26:17.699 --> 26:21.140
Now, you came in
through the front door.

26:21.175 --> 26:24.020
Let's take the scenic route.

27:00.180 --> 27:04.220
But they can see the lift.

27:04.255 --> 27:07.865
Why aren't they...?

27:07.900 --> 27:11.264
We're right out in the open.
They can see everything!

27:11.299 --> 27:16.379
Do they look like they can see us? No, but...
Look at us! We couldn't be any more public! Hello!

27:16.414 --> 27:19.465
Hey, you there, hello!

27:19.500 --> 27:24.739
It's called a perception filter. He can
sort of see us, but we don't quite register.

27:24.774 --> 27:27.465
Just like something
in the corner of your eye.

27:27.500 --> 27:34.539
It only works on this exact spot.
Step off... Hi! Nice night!

27:34.574 --> 27:36.620
And lo, we are perceived.

27:38.179 --> 27:42.505
How does it work? No idea. We know
how to use it, not how it happens.

27:42.540 --> 27:46.700
But if I were to guess, I'd say that there was once
a dimensionally transcendental chameleon-circuit

27:46.735 --> 27:53.139
placed right on this spot which welded its
perception properties to a spatio-temporal rift.

27:53.174 --> 27:55.305
But that sounds kind of ridiculous.

27:55.340 --> 28:01.019
"Invisible lift" has got more of a ring to it.
But if no-one can see it when the lift's coming up,

28:01.054 --> 28:04.299
there's a bloody big hole in
the floor, don't people fall in?

28:04.334 --> 28:06.505
That is so Welsh. What is?

28:06.540 --> 28:09.939
I show you something fantastic -
you find fault.

28:31.980 --> 28:35.864
I just don't understand...
I tell you what I don't understand.

28:35.899 --> 28:40.425
You're gonna rattle on with that, "How can this
be true?" What's it gonna take for you people?

28:40.460 --> 28:45.539
If you want evidence of aliens, how about that great
spaceship hovering over London on Christmas Day?

28:45.574 --> 28:48.424
What about the battle of Canary
Wharf? A Cyberman in every home!

28:48.459 --> 28:53.619
My boyfriend says it's like a sort of terrorism.
Like they put drugs in the water supplies -

28:53.654 --> 28:57.557
psychotropic drugs, causing
mass hallucinations and stuff.

28:57.592 --> 29:01.460
Yeah, well your boyfriend's stupid.
Oh, you've met him?

29:07.580 --> 29:11.104
So... you catch aliens?

29:11.139 --> 29:13.264
Yup. You catch aliens for a living?

29:13.299 --> 29:16.740
Yes, we do. You're an alien-catcher?
Yes, I am. Caught any good aliens?

29:16.775 --> 29:19.299
Tons of 'em! That's hell of a job.
Sure is.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.860
This is so weird.

29:26.900 --> 29:32.584
And who are you, then?
Captain Jack Harkness.

29:32.619 --> 29:37.539
I did some research and there's only
one Captain Jack Harkness on record.

29:37.574 --> 29:44.699
And he disappeared in 1941. Well...
that couldn't be me... could it?

29:48.059 --> 29:50.824
We don't just catch aliens.

29:50.859 --> 29:53.145
We scavenge the stuff
they leave behind.

29:53.180 --> 29:56.625
Find ways of using it.
Arming the human race for the future.

29:56.660 --> 30:01.820
The twenty-first century is when it all changes, and
you've got to be ready. But who's in charge of you?

30:01.855 --> 30:06.225
We're separate from the government. Outside
the police. Beyond the United Nations.

30:06.260 --> 30:12.660
Cos if one power got hold of this stuff, they could
use it for their own purposes. But so could you.

30:12.695 --> 30:17.859
All alien technology stays on the base.
No-one's allowed to take anything outside.

30:53.619 --> 30:57.424
So go on, then. How the hell
did you end up in Cardiff?

30:57.459 --> 31:03.339
This is Torchwood Three. Torchwood One
was London, destroyed in the battle.

31:03.374 --> 31:08.384
Torchwood Two is an office
in Glasgow, very strange man.

31:08.419 --> 31:13.180
Torchwood three, Cardiff. Torchwood Four's
kinda gone missing, but we'll find it one day.

31:13.215 --> 31:15.104
So you just fancied Cardiff?

31:15.139 --> 31:19.319
There's a rift in space and time
running right through the city.

31:19.354 --> 31:23.499
The Weevils didn't come in a
spaceship. They just slip through.

31:23.534 --> 31:25.705
All sorts of things
get washed up here.

31:25.740 --> 31:32.060
Creatures, timeshifts, space junk, debris,
flotsam and jetsam. Sounds like Cardiff, yeah.

31:32.095 --> 31:34.700
Hey, don't knock it, I'm a citizen.

31:34.735 --> 31:37.537
But where are you from?

31:37.572 --> 31:40.305
All sorts of places.

31:40.340 --> 31:42.585
Thing is, we could liaise on this...

31:42.620 --> 31:47.660
the serial killer. I could be like
your liaison with the police.

31:47.695 --> 31:50.144
Right, I can see the mistake.

31:50.179 --> 31:54.184
You think because we showed up
we're out to catch the killer.

31:54.219 --> 31:59.019
Sorry. Nothing to do with us. Then what
were you doing there? Testing the glove.

32:00.020 --> 32:03.864
We need murder victims, simple as that. The
glove only works on the recently deceased,

32:03.899 --> 32:08.059
and the more violent the trauma, the stronger
the resurrection. All we need is fresh meat.

32:08.094 --> 32:12.297
No, you were asking that man, John Tucker, I
saw you, you were asking him about his killer.

32:12.332 --> 32:16.500
He'd just been murdered, what else are you
gonna ask? You could get an ID. You could help.

32:16.535 --> 32:21.425
We're busy. And your work is more
important? Now you've got it.

32:21.460 --> 32:26.620
Well, that's tough shit. Cos if you let me go,
then I have a duty, cos that glove could help us.

32:28.340 --> 32:31.539
If you remember. What d'you mean?

32:31.574 --> 32:33.740
How's your drink?

32:38.140 --> 32:43.340
Have you poisoned me? Don't be so
dramatic. It's an amnesia pill.

32:43.375 --> 32:46.304
My own recipe, with a touch
of denial and a dash of retcon.

32:46.339 --> 32:49.699
Wake up tomorrow morning, you'll have
forgotten everything about Torchwood.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.740
Worse still,
you'll have forgotten me...

32:54.420 --> 32:56.219
.. which is kind of tragic.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.219
Don't think you can fight it
by staying awake.

33:05.254 --> 33:07.305
I mixed in a little
bit of sedative too.

33:07.340 --> 33:11.939
Then I'll tell someone! D'you really
want us to come and find them too?

33:11.974 --> 33:14.865
You bastard. Language!

33:14.900 --> 33:17.300
Nice knowing you, Gwen Cooper.

34:13.299 --> 34:15.304
Hello. All right?

34:15.339 --> 34:21.458
You having a good time? I was.
Can I buy you a drink?

34:21.494 --> 34:24.259
No, thanks, I'm fine.

34:26.379 --> 34:28.699
Am I wasting my time?

34:28.734 --> 34:31.020
I dunno, are you?

34:33.620 --> 34:38.978
I've got to be up early and I've got hell of a day
tomorrow and I can't be bothered with all the chat.

34:45.380 --> 34:49.059
So... do you want a drink or what?

34:58.299 --> 35:04.020
Bloody hell fire. You're coming
home with me, you are. Right now!

36:13.979 --> 36:19.380
Oi, you bastard, come here! Linda, what
the fuck do you think you are doing?!

36:19.415 --> 36:22.144
I'm taking him home
and I'm having him, now piss off!

36:22.179 --> 36:26.700
What the fuck d'you think you're doing with my
girlfriend? Hey, she was on her own. She never said.

36:26.735 --> 36:30.345
You fucking tosser.
Colin, button it, he's mine.

36:30.380 --> 36:35.979
Do you want to have a go? You want to have a go?
Come on then mate! Well, if it makes it easier...

36:42.299 --> 36:44.985
I am so having you.

36:45.020 --> 36:47.540
I'm having him first! Taxi!

38:24.699 --> 38:29.460
Did you get pissed? No.

38:29.495 --> 38:31.857
What time is it?

38:31.892 --> 38:34.185
Seven thirty.

38:34.220 --> 38:38.780
You said you were working
last night. I was.

38:38.815 --> 38:41.259
Then how come
you fell asleep in here?

38:41.294 --> 38:45.300
I haven't, I was... typing.

38:45.335 --> 38:47.584
That is work.

38:47.619 --> 38:50.265
I'm not having a go, I'm just saying.

38:50.300 --> 38:54.219
Not exactly clever going out on the lash
when you've just had a bang on the head.

38:54.254 --> 38:58.619
I hope you didn't drive in that
state. Who were you with? Diane?

38:58.654 --> 39:01.180
Must've been. Yeah.

39:06.179 --> 39:08.779
Have any luck? With what?

39:08.814 --> 39:11.344
Captain Jack Harkness.

39:11.379 --> 39:18.179
How d'you mean? Who's he? Oh, well don't
worry about me, just go ahead, wasting my time.

39:30.019 --> 39:34.299
Aye, aye. Come to see
where the real work's done?

39:34.334 --> 39:38.580
Yes, sir, that's right, sir.
How's it going? Sod all.

39:42.819 --> 39:49.305
Is that the murder weapon? Clever, mind,
they worked it all out on a computer.

39:49.340 --> 39:54.900
Took measurements from the stab wounds,
calculated the shape of the blade and stuff,

39:54.935 --> 39:58.100
even those prongs -
I don't know how they do it.

39:58.135 --> 40:00.824
Nasty-looking beast, though.

40:00.859 --> 40:06.705
D'you recognise it? No. We're trying
to trace it. Can't be that many of 'em.

40:06.740 --> 40:12.140
Sort of ornamental. We're checking the CDE
logs with customs in case it's been imported.

40:12.175 --> 40:14.265
Find the knife,
we might find the killer.

40:14.300 --> 40:19.900
Anyway, if it rings any bells,
give's a shout. Yeah. Thanks.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.539
.. I said to Geoff,
it's not demotion being put in goal,

40:36.574 --> 40:39.465
it's vital,
but was he having any of it?

40:39.500 --> 40:43.179
He's off and moaning, says, who
books the ground, who pays the subs?

40:43.214 --> 40:46.504
And all the time,
he's wheezing away,

40:46.539 --> 40:48.784
and I'm like, Geoff,
you're proving my point mate...

40:48.819 --> 40:56.419
"You never come down, you're in charge of transport.
" I said, "Mam, I can't go hopping on a truck!"

40:56.454 --> 41:01.899
All that Christmas stuff, all over again,
I was like, for God's sake, leave it...

43:20.380 --> 43:23.665
Hello again. You were right.

43:23.700 --> 43:29.379
You told Jack we should liaise with the
police. I was the only one who bothered.

43:29.414 --> 43:32.859
So I was the only one
who saw the report.

43:35.260 --> 43:39.825
They got a good likeness.
I'm arresting you for...

43:39.860 --> 43:45.859
How do I know you? I thought you saw it. And that
can trip the amnesia, one image, if you're clever.

43:45.894 --> 43:48.465
He said you were good.

43:48.500 --> 43:53.319
Anyway. It's not much good
now, I can't really...

43:53.354 --> 43:58.139
But you're gonna put up a fight.
So I've got...

43:58.174 --> 44:00.339
Um. Hold on. Sorry.

44:04.820 --> 44:06.624
There. That's better.

44:06.659 --> 44:10.265
Put it down. You had to come back.
Put down the gun.

44:10.300 --> 44:15.699
You're the only one who can make the
link. Well, the only one in public.

44:15.734 --> 44:20.820
Torchwood's gonna find out
by morning, but I'll be gone.

44:20.855 --> 44:23.940
I don't know where. Far away.

44:23.975 --> 44:26.300
What am I gonna do?

44:27.819 --> 44:30.540
I loved this job. I really loved it.

44:30.575 --> 44:34.539
And now I've got to run.

44:34.574 --> 44:37.464
Oh, Christ.

44:37.499 --> 44:43.619
How can you do any other job after this one?
Please. Put down the gun. Cos it gets inside you.

44:43.654 --> 44:47.897
You do this job for long
enough, and you end up thinking,

44:47.932 --> 44:52.140
"How come we get all
the Weevils and bollocks and shit?"

44:52.175 --> 44:55.065
Is that what alien life is? Filth?

44:55.100 --> 44:59.939
But maybe there's better stuff
out there, brilliant stuff,

44:59.974 --> 45:02.516
beautiful stuff. Just...

45:02.551 --> 45:05.059
they don't come here.

45:07.020 --> 45:10.384
This planet's so dirty,
that's all we get - the shit.

45:10.419 --> 45:15.559
I don't know what you're talking
about. I wish I could forget.

45:15.594 --> 45:20.699
Why did you kill those people?
For the glove. Stay where you are.

45:20.734 --> 45:23.824
I needed the bodies.
That's how it works. Violent death.

45:23.859 --> 45:28.859
And it was so easy. To bring them back, I'd position
myself behind the head, so they'd never see me twice.

45:28.894 --> 45:32.265
You killed three people.
It was the only way.

45:32.300 --> 45:37.059
The more I use the glove, the more I
control it. I don't understand, what glove?

45:37.094 --> 45:40.425
If I can get enough practice,
then think what that glove could do.

45:40.460 --> 45:44.979
If I could get it work all the time, on anything,
beyond the two minutes, if it could work permanently,

45:45.014 --> 45:46.624
it could resurrect.

45:46.659 --> 45:50.545
Resurrection on demand for
the whole world, isn't that good?

45:50.580 --> 45:55.859
Isn't it though? Well, that's what I've
been working for, all day and all night.

45:55.894 --> 45:59.665
The rest of them
go swanning about, but I'm working.

45:59.700 --> 46:04.344
You've got to get inside this stuff.
Surrender yourself to it.

46:04.379 --> 46:09.780
I did, with the knife, and the glove, and that's
why the perception filter isn't gonna work on me.

46:13.219 --> 46:15.980
Where did he come from?

46:17.300 --> 46:20.139
What have you done?

46:21.219 --> 46:24.059
Please don't. I can't let you go.

46:24.094 --> 46:26.780
Please. I've got to.

46:26.815 --> 46:28.185
I'm sorry.

46:28.220 --> 46:30.825
Don't, don't, don't.

46:30.860 --> 46:32.979
I've got to, I've got to,
I've got to.

46:37.859 --> 46:39.819
Put down the gun.

46:46.860 --> 46:50.540
Susie, it's over. Now, come with me.

47:08.060 --> 47:11.940
I remember. I remember.

47:15.860 --> 47:18.140
I remember.

48:15.180 --> 48:20.700
Owen and Toshiko, you didn't tell them
that you were shot in the head and survived.

48:20.735 --> 48:24.579
You didn't tell them either.
Followed my lead.

48:25.499 --> 48:29.980
Keep doing that, and you
might just get through this.

48:30.015 --> 48:32.619
But she killed you.

48:35.099 --> 48:37.639
I can't die.

48:37.674 --> 48:40.179
OK. But I can't.

48:42.060 --> 48:46.539
Something happened to me a while
back. Long story. And far away.

48:48.099 --> 48:49.625
But I was killed,

48:49.660 --> 48:53.580
and then I was brought back
to life, and ever since then...

48:53.615 --> 48:56.265
I can't die.

48:56.300 --> 48:59.225
But how? I don't know.

48:59.260 --> 49:05.059
One day, I'll find a doctor, the right sort of
doctor and maybe he can explain it. But until then...

49:05.094 --> 49:06.624
Nothing kills you?

49:06.659 --> 49:09.859
Kind of freaks people out, so...

49:09.894 --> 49:13.059
Best if you don't say anything.

49:13.094 --> 49:14.585
It doesn't matter anyway.

49:14.620 --> 49:17.980
You'll only wipe my memory again.
Why would I do that?

49:19.619 --> 49:22.345
Torchwood's got a vacancy.

49:22.380 --> 49:25.299
Job going spare. Do you want it?

49:25.334 --> 49:28.357
But what d'you need me for?

49:28.392 --> 49:31.066
Cos maybe you were right.

49:31.101 --> 49:33.740
We could do more to help.

49:36.180 --> 49:41.539
What d'you think,
d'you want to join up? Yeah.

49:44.259 --> 49:45.820
I do. Yes.

50:08.739 --> 50:11.025
Is that plane on fire?

50:11.060 --> 50:14.185
I've got to go to work.
So let's see what we came for.

50:14.220 --> 50:17.660
There's an alien on the loose, we
don't know where it is, why it's here.

50:17.695 --> 50:21.784
The over-riding factor
for the parasite is to have sex.

50:21.819 --> 50:25.779
It's a struggle between where Carys
ends and the alien begins. Sorry?

50:29.540 --> 50:31.140
What's this for?

50:33.620 --> 50:35.259
Please help me.
