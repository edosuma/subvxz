00:01.956 --> 00:05.954
I hope you won't mind if I leave
you both alone for a few days.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.980
No, no, by all means.

00:09.403 --> 00:11.610
Mrs Regina Standish.

00:13.610 --> 00:15.609
Mrs Bligh, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to ask you

00:15.610 --> 00:16.609
to stay away for a while.

00:16.610 --> 00:17.609
No!

00:17.610 --> 00:19.609
Any progress we make with James,

00:19.610 --> 00:21.570
you undo
with your displays of distress.

00:22.610 --> 00:24.444
I've come to talk
about our daughter.

00:24.445 --> 00:25.610
Who is she?

00:26.610 --> 00:28.444
Where is she?
I... I...

00:28.445 --> 00:29.777
Well, is she here? Overseas?
I can't tell you.

00:29.778 --> 00:31.609
Why? Not yet.
Why not?!

00:31.610 --> 00:33.348
Look at what you made me do!

00:35.610 --> 00:37.610
Colin, what have you done?

00:38.610 --> 00:39.945
Come on.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.610
Are you right with what we've done?

00:45.610 --> 00:47.397
We saved more lives
from being ruined.

Tue-moi!

01:23.622 --> 01:24.622
Kill me!

01:44.988 --> 01:47.257
Anything I can help you with,
Mr Briggs?

01:47.283 --> 01:49.282
Um, no, no, I'm just passing.

01:49.283 --> 01:52.282
It's always good to pop in
for a prayer.

01:52.283 --> 01:55.282
The flowers can wait
if I'd be disturbing you.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.283
No, I'll just go and say g'day
to the missus.

01:58.851 --> 02:01.851
Such a dab hand with pastry
was your Millie.

02:02.851 --> 02:04.851
A loss to the CWA.

02:06.851 --> 02:08.019
Hey, for her.

02:09.186 --> 02:10.850
Thank you.

02:10.851 --> 02:12.850
A bucket of water
would greatly assist.

02:12.851 --> 02:13.850
I'll be inside.

02:13.851 --> 02:16.850
I'll just leave it at the door,
if that's alright.

02:16.851 --> 02:17.850
I've got mucky boots.

02:17.851 --> 02:19.851
Oh, yes, yes, of course. Indeed.

02:24.369 --> 02:27.368
Ah, Miss Adams.
Doris.

02:27.369 --> 02:29.368
I've just come from the church.

02:29.369 --> 02:30.368
I saw Mr Briggs there

02:30.369 --> 02:32.870
looking for all the world
like a lost soul.

02:32.871 --> 02:34.368
Really?

02:34.369 --> 02:36.368
I suspect he's missing your company.

02:36.369 --> 02:38.369
A single man, a single woman.

02:39.369 --> 02:43.368
In spite of a difference in years,
affections form.

02:43.369 --> 02:47.368
There are some who say you've broken
his heart by accepting Mr Bligh.

02:47.369 --> 02:49.368
There are some who need
to padlock their tongues.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.368
Oh, indeed, indeed.

02:51.369 --> 02:55.204
I only know he wasn't himself.
He wasn't himself at all.

03:06.639 --> 03:08.639
Well, I know that look.
I'll put the kettle on.

03:15.639 --> 03:16.639
Thanks.

03:19.639 --> 03:24.306
People are starting to wonder.
Doris Collins is starting to wonder.

03:24.307 --> 03:25.638
Bugger Doris Collins.

03:25.639 --> 03:29.638
The best way to get on is just
to act like nothing's happened.

03:29.639 --> 03:30.639
Yeah.

03:31.639 --> 03:33.638
I went to church
to say a prayer for him.

03:33.639 --> 03:35.638
Well, I couldn't even walk in.

03:35.639 --> 03:37.639
We did what we had to.

03:38.639 --> 03:41.140
Every man deserves
a Christian burial.

03:41.141 --> 03:43.639
It was burial for him
or the law for them.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.639
I know.

03:46.639 --> 03:49.139
My boy Daniel died on Kokoda

03:49.184 --> 03:51.183
and he's up there somewhere
in the mud.

03:51.184 --> 03:54.352
There's no cross, no prayers,
no blessing.

03:56.130 --> 03:57.462
It's haunted me ever since.

03:59.462 --> 04:01.462
Drove the old girl
into an early grave.

04:04.697 --> 04:06.696
You've got my silence, but...

04:08.462 --> 04:11.462
..we done to Bert what
I blamed God for doing to my boy.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.462
You're a good man, Roy.
It don't sit right, Sarah.

04:17.689 --> 04:19.024
You know it don't...

04:21.689 --> 04:23.024
..no matter what you say.

04:26.357 --> 04:27.688
So,
when we come into the church,

04:27.689 --> 04:30.688
we bless ourself with holy water
in the sign of the cross.

04:30.689 --> 04:31.689
You do it.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.688
That's good.

04:36.689 --> 04:39.489
It will become second nature
in a little while.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.499
So, you are here for your first
instruction in the Catholic faith.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.500
Are you ready?
Yes.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.499
Yes.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.499
So, some of the things
that we do and believe

04:50.500 --> 04:52.499
will seem a little strange
to you at first.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.499
Do you see that little cupboard
on the altar?

04:55.500 --> 04:56.499
We call that the tabernacle.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.667
In that,
we keep the reserved hosts -

04:58.668 --> 05:02.001
wafers consecrated
during the Holy Mass.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.499
Now, we believe that
during the consecration,

05:04.500 --> 05:07.499
the bread and wine truly become
the body and blood

05:07.500 --> 05:08.499
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

05:08.500 --> 05:12.500
You're saying God actually changes
bread and wine into flesh and blood?

05:13.500 --> 05:15.668
If he can create the universe,
Anna...

05:16.668 --> 05:18.168
Now, come with me.

05:39.655 --> 05:41.655
No, Mother,
I'm not dashing off. Why do you ask?

05:41.753 --> 05:43.752
Well, I want to spend time
with James and Olivia

05:43.753 --> 05:46.752
so I'll be leaving for the city
on Sunday after matins.

05:46.753 --> 05:50.752
Matins! Oh, that takes me back.
Now, it's known you're visiting.

05:50.754 --> 05:52.588
You'll be expected
in the family pew.

05:52.589 --> 05:54.921
Are you coming in?
No, I haven't got time.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.753
And it may encourage Anna
to join us.

05:57.754 --> 05:58.753
The longer we can avoid her

05:58.754 --> 06:01.088
publicly aligning herself
with the papacy, the better.

06:01.088 --> 06:02.752
What are you up to?

06:02.753 --> 06:05.087
You say you're here
to meet Miss Adams?

06:05.088 --> 06:06.752
She'll be there too, I hope.

06:06.753 --> 06:09.254
Ah.
What?

06:09.255 --> 06:10.752
Stop making mischief.

06:10.753 --> 06:12.752
I'm not aware that I am.

06:12.753 --> 06:14.752
She's a Jew.
I'm well aware of that.

06:14.753 --> 06:17.753
And religion is a weapon
that you can use against her.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.753
Differences exist, Carolyn.
They cannot be ignored.

06:23.753 --> 06:24.753
So, can I count on you?

06:27.753 --> 06:29.753
Good. I shall see you then.

06:33.421 --> 06:36.752
It's his way of coping.
He'll come out of it.

06:36.753 --> 06:38.752
He was just trying to protect me
is all.

06:38.753 --> 06:41.087
If I hadn't made Bert angry...
It's not your fault.

06:41.088 --> 06:42.752
I suggested going on a picnic

06:42.753 --> 06:44.753
and Bert just bowled up,
said he was going.

06:44.754 --> 06:46.752
I tried to stop him and...
Eve, you were upset.

06:46.753 --> 06:49.752
..he just went crazy hitting me
and calling me horrible names!

06:49.753 --> 06:50.753
Eve! Eve!

06:53.753 --> 06:55.752
You had no choice. You know that.

06:55.753 --> 06:58.753
At the very least, Colin would
be sent to a reformatory.

06:59.921 --> 07:02.752
And if they decided
that he was lying to protect you,

07:02.753 --> 07:03.753
you could hang.

07:06.753 --> 07:08.752
People will believe
Bert's gone away.

07:08.753 --> 07:10.752
Act like he has, alright?
What if he's missed?

07:10.753 --> 07:13.752
We will face that
if and when we have to.

07:13.753 --> 07:14.753
Alright?

07:19.255 --> 07:20.753
You know where I am if you need me.

07:24.753 --> 07:25.754
Before you go...

07:30.255 --> 07:32.752
..I found this in his swag.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.754
It's 1,000 quid
in a cheque from Mr Bligh.

07:36.753 --> 07:40.753
What should I do with it?
Why would George give Bert money?

07:41.753 --> 07:42.753
Eve?

07:44.753 --> 07:45.753
What he saw.

07:49.753 --> 07:52.753
Harry and Mr James.

07:58.754 --> 08:01.752
There's no need to look so alarmed,
Mrs Bligh.

08:01.753 --> 08:04.587
I made inquiries
after we ran into each other

08:04.588 --> 08:05.752
and found out James is a patient.

08:05.753 --> 08:09.752
I was there seeing a friend.
I'm here to help.

08:09.753 --> 08:11.752
Help isn't required.

08:11.753 --> 08:12.753
I assume
it's some sort of breakdown.

08:12.754 --> 08:15.752
I don't know what to say to you.
Don't be concerned.

08:15.753 --> 08:17.753
They were discreet
about his condition.

08:18.753 --> 08:20.752
I don't know the details,

08:20.753 --> 08:23.753
but I am here to help
in any way I can.

08:25.753 --> 08:27.087
I don't understand why.

08:27.088 --> 08:29.752
An investment in my possible future.

08:29.753 --> 08:34.087
We may all be family one day.
You're that interested in Anna?

08:34.087 --> 08:35.919
I'm being badgered to marry

08:35.921 --> 08:38.587
and she's the only vaguely
interesting candidate...

08:39.753 --> 08:43.753
..which sounds less than romantic,
but... you understand.

08:45.753 --> 08:49.753
So, if I can help,
discretion is assured.

08:50.753 --> 08:51.753
Thank you.

08:53.088 --> 08:57.588
And perhaps you'll trust me
with the full story... in time.

09:13.380 --> 09:14.544
You asked for me?

09:14.545 --> 09:17.545
I want... I want to go home.

09:17.632 --> 09:19.631
I see.
Now!

09:19.632 --> 09:20.631
Now!

09:20.632 --> 09:23.299
There's no need for agitation.
I just... I just want to...

09:23.300 --> 09:26.299
I just want to leave!
I'm sure part of you does.

09:26.300 --> 09:30.632
The deviant side wants to flee from
the treatment that will see it gone.

09:32.632 --> 09:33.631
I can leave if I want to.

09:33.632 --> 09:35.631
There, I'm afraid, you're wrong.

09:35.632 --> 09:37.631
I came here voluntarily.

09:37.632 --> 09:40.631
Your father and your wife
signed you in.

09:40.632 --> 09:42.152
You cannot leave
without their consent.

09:43.632 --> 09:45.631
I want to see them.

09:45.632 --> 09:46.631
I want to see them.

09:46.632 --> 09:50.631
That is not... not possible, James.
I just want to leave.

09:50.632 --> 09:51.632
Relax.

09:56.632 --> 10:01.632
Your kind lacks moral fibre, James,
and I'm here to provide it for you.

10:05.632 --> 10:07.632
I can't stand the pain.

10:09.134 --> 10:10.632
The confusion.

10:11.632 --> 10:14.631
After the treatments,
I don't know who I am.

10:14.632 --> 10:16.632
But you know who you're not.

10:17.632 --> 10:20.631
You are not the deviant within.

10:20.632 --> 10:23.632
We will defeat him... together.

10:25.967 --> 10:27.800
A nurse will bring something
to settle you.

10:37.545 --> 10:39.258
I won't breathe a word
about what they did.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.420
Tell Mr Bligh.
I will.

10:41.483 --> 10:42.651
It's our shame too.

10:44.483 --> 10:46.151
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:47.482 --> 10:50.482
I'm thinking about selling up,
leaving.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.482
Colin won't forget here.

10:52.483 --> 10:55.482
Do you have somewhere to go?
My cousins will set us right.

10:55.483 --> 10:56.650
Amy's all I'd miss.

10:56.651 --> 10:59.482
I'll give Mr Bligh his money back.
No!

10:59.483 --> 11:01.984
I'll tell him Bert gave it to me
before he left.

11:01.985 --> 11:04.482
No, it would raise
too many questions.

11:04.483 --> 11:06.482
We can't even say we know about it.

11:06.483 --> 11:09.150
Use the money for Colin's education.

11:09.151 --> 11:13.317
He's bright. He'll go far.

11:13.317 --> 11:16.482
But you're right. Not here.

11:27.483 --> 11:29.650
64. Looks like I've won again!

11:29.651 --> 11:32.150
I'm attempting
to make you feel comfortable.

11:32.151 --> 11:34.483
Oh, I see. Perhaps I'm a natural.

11:35.483 --> 11:38.482
Your sister has agreed
to join us at church.

11:38.483 --> 11:42.482
It might help to allay idle chatter
if Anna could be there also.

11:42.482 --> 11:43.481
She's taking instruction.

11:43.483 --> 11:45.482
Yeah, she is not a Catholic yet...
Nevertheless...

11:45.483 --> 11:47.482
..and I hope never will be.

11:47.483 --> 11:50.482
Your father must be
rolling in his grave.

11:50.483 --> 11:53.483
Surely it's enough worrying about
what the living think, Mother.

11:55.483 --> 11:57.482
Oh, if you'd care to accompany us,

11:57.483 --> 11:59.482
although you may feel
a little uncomfortable

11:59.483 --> 12:01.482
at a Christian service.
This Sunday?

12:01.482 --> 12:02.482
Yes.
Of course.

12:02.484 --> 12:07.150
Well, I understand if your faith
precludes it on a regular basis.

12:07.151 --> 12:10.984
Of course, as George's wife,
it would be expected, normally.

12:10.985 --> 12:12.482
Mother.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.482
We can't tiptoe around
these matters, George.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.150
Well, if we're mixing faiths,

12:16.151 --> 12:17.482
I should go with Sarah
to the Goldbergs tomorrow.

12:17.483 --> 12:19.482
You're more than welcome.

12:19.483 --> 12:22.482
It's for Shabbat.
Really?

12:22.482 --> 12:24.482
It's Hanukkah,
which makes it particularly special.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.483
I think Father just did
another spin in his coffin!

12:28.483 --> 12:31.482
There's no need for poor taste,
George.

12:31.483 --> 12:33.483
If you'll excuse me...

12:40.483 --> 12:44.483
I've been waiting for a chance
to speak with you alone.

12:47.483 --> 12:49.483
I was at the Walker farm today.

12:51.483 --> 12:52.482
Bert's gone.

12:52.483 --> 12:55.318
Has he? Good.

12:56.482 --> 12:58.482
Eve mentioned James.

12:59.483 --> 13:01.483
She assumed I knew.

13:44.483 --> 13:46.482
Mr Bligh,
what are you doing out of bed?

13:46.483 --> 13:49.482
Come on, now.
Don't do anything foolish.

13:49.483 --> 13:51.318
Orderlies! Orderlies!

13:52.483 --> 13:54.482
I'll need a sedative.
No! No!

13:54.482 --> 13:57.483
I want to go home! I want to leave!

13:58.985 --> 14:01.482
You can't keep me here.
You can't keep me here.

14:01.483 --> 14:04.483
No! Get off me! Get off me!

14:05.482 --> 14:07.482
Let me go!

14:18.483 --> 14:19.985
Olivia knows?

14:21.483 --> 14:22.604
She's a tower of strength...

14:23.483 --> 14:27.482
..working with James
to help him overcome it.

14:27.483 --> 14:30.483
What if he can't?
She asked that too.

14:32.483 --> 14:33.483
If I'd been different...

14:34.985 --> 14:36.483
..after Elaine died...

14:38.483 --> 14:39.482
I left him to Mother.

14:39.483 --> 14:41.483
It's nothing you've done.
You must know that.

14:43.482 --> 14:44.481
You sound so sure.

14:44.483 --> 14:47.817
I've known many men like James.
This turns my stomach.

14:47.818 --> 14:50.483
He's your son.
Mm-hm.

14:52.483 --> 14:55.483
Well, I'm here
if you need to talk about it.

15:01.151 --> 15:04.483
The only offensive thing
I know about men like James...

15:06.151 --> 15:09.482
..they were murdered in the camps
for who they were,

15:09.483 --> 15:11.483
along with the Jews.

15:23.483 --> 15:25.481
Amen.
Amen.

15:25.482 --> 15:27.482
Amen.

15:28.482 --> 15:30.481
So, she chases me down the street.

15:30.483 --> 15:34.482
"Mr Gold! Mr Gold! I want
to wish you a happy Hanukkah."

15:34.483 --> 15:35.482
"Hanukkah?" I say.

15:35.483 --> 15:38.482
And she says,
"Yeah, it's Christmas for Jews,

15:38.483 --> 15:39.483
"only not so festive."

15:40.484 --> 15:42.482
Who are we to question
Doris Collins?

15:42.482 --> 15:44.481
Greater men have tried!

15:44.482 --> 15:46.481
Not necessarily successfully,
though.

15:46.482 --> 15:48.482
Not at all.

15:58.483 --> 16:00.482
I appreciate you
giving me the chance

16:00.483 --> 16:02.483
to better understand Sarah's world.

16:03.985 --> 16:06.482
And now you have your own nation.

16:06.483 --> 16:09.483
Israel is only five years old
and has many enemies...

16:10.483 --> 16:13.483
..but with or without her,
we will survive.

16:14.483 --> 16:16.484
Our faith will sustain us.

16:18.317 --> 16:21.482
And so many of us
have just died for it.

16:30.483 --> 16:33.482
Thank you, Amy.
Is anything the matter?

16:33.483 --> 16:35.483
No, ma'am.

16:36.483 --> 16:38.482
Sit down.

16:38.483 --> 16:40.483
Oh, no, I couldn't.
Indulge me.

16:42.483 --> 16:43.483
Come a little closer.

16:49.483 --> 16:51.483
Clearly, you've been crying.

16:52.651 --> 16:54.482
My sister Eve is leaving.

16:54.483 --> 16:57.482
She says it's because
her Bert shot through.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.483
Hmm. Well, she's well rid of him.

17:03.151 --> 17:05.482
Ma'am, if you'd rather I left too...

17:05.483 --> 17:07.482
Why should I?

17:07.483 --> 17:13.483
I'm a reminder of what happened
between my brother and Mr James.

17:15.483 --> 17:19.317
Amy, what you are, my dear,

17:19.318 --> 17:22.483
is a loyal and very valued member
of this household.

17:23.483 --> 17:25.482
However, if you wish to leave,

17:25.483 --> 17:27.482
I shall write you
the best of references

17:27.483 --> 17:30.483
and ensure that you secure
a good position elsewhere.

17:33.483 --> 17:34.651
No.

17:36.482 --> 17:37.482
This is home.

17:39.483 --> 17:40.484
Thank you.

17:43.483 --> 17:45.483
Please excuse me.
Of course.

17:52.483 --> 17:55.482
Excuse me?
Visiting hours are over. Sorry.

17:55.483 --> 17:57.818
I imagine Dr Duncan's left
for the day.

18:02.483 --> 18:05.483
No need. You're in luck.
Thank you.

18:11.484 --> 18:12.651
Jack?

18:13.651 --> 18:15.482
Jack?

18:15.483 --> 18:17.150
Maybe he snuck out
when I wasn't looking.

18:17.151 --> 18:19.483
His place is just round the corner.

18:24.483 --> 18:26.150
On second thoughts,

18:26.151 --> 18:28.483
I won't bother him at home
after a busy day.

18:28.484 --> 18:31.482
If not before,
I'll see him at church on Sunday.

18:31.483 --> 18:33.483
Maybe get the chance to talk then.

18:34.483 --> 18:35.483
Sorry to bother you.

18:38.483 --> 18:41.482
We should thank Mother
for trying to score that point.

18:41.483 --> 18:43.482
I might not have gone otherwise.

18:43.483 --> 18:45.483
Well, I'm glad you did.
So am I.

18:48.651 --> 18:51.651
Last night and tonight,
the talk of the camps...

18:54.483 --> 18:56.482
You were a Jew in France
at that time.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.943
One day, I'd like to know.

19:01.483 --> 19:03.483
I'd rather we concentrate
on the future.

19:06.483 --> 19:07.484
Mm-hm.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.483
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

19:39.128 --> 19:41.863
When the wicked man turneth away
from his wickedness

19:41.914 --> 19:43.179
that he hath committed

19:43.258 --> 19:46.257
and doeth that
which is lawful and right,

19:46.258 --> 19:48.258
he shall save his soul alive.

19:49.718 --> 19:52.592
If we say that we have no sin,
we deceive ourselves

19:52.593 --> 19:54.257
and the truth is not in this...

19:54.258 --> 19:57.257
A Jew?
Where's the lightning bolt?

19:57.258 --> 19:59.257
Carolyn.
Sarah.

19:59.258 --> 20:01.257
Shh!

20:01.258 --> 20:03.258
..and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness.

20:05.258 --> 20:06.257
Dearly beloved brethren,

20:06.258 --> 20:09.425
the Scriptures moveth us
in sundry places to acknowledge

20:09.426 --> 20:13.257
and confess our manifold sins
and wickedness

20:13.258 --> 20:16.257
and that we should not dissemble
nor cloak them

20:16.258 --> 20:19.257
in the face of Almighty God,
our Heavenly Father,

20:19.258 --> 20:25.257
but to confess them with the humble,
lowly, penitent and obedient heart

20:25.258 --> 20:29.257
to the end that we may obtain
forgiveness of the same

20:29.258 --> 20:33.426
by his infinite goodness and mercy.

20:52.258 --> 20:54.258
Meet me at three where it happened.

20:55.258 --> 20:56.258
We both need it.

21:02.259 --> 21:06.257
Oh, Jack!
Can't stop. Sorry.

21:06.258 --> 21:08.257
Well,
it can't be anything so urgent.

21:08.258 --> 21:09.257
Clearly, there is.

21:09.258 --> 21:12.257
Well, it's very rude of him not to
greet you after all these years away,

21:12.258 --> 21:14.257
unless it's something
that we've done.

21:14.258 --> 21:16.257
Apart from trying
to steal away his best nurse.

21:16.258 --> 21:17.257
I wish you luck with that!

21:17.258 --> 21:18.258
Here she is.

21:20.258 --> 21:21.257
We were just talking about George

21:21.258 --> 21:23.257
trying to make you
a member of the idle rich.

21:23.258 --> 21:25.257
I wish you luck with that.

21:25.258 --> 21:27.257
No wonder you have trouble with her,
Mother.

21:27.258 --> 21:28.257
She's just like me.

21:28.258 --> 21:30.258
Must you?
I must.

21:31.258 --> 21:34.257
Let's dispatch Mother to the city
and then we'll have a good chat.

21:34.258 --> 21:36.257
It stuns me she's going
and yielding you the field.

21:36.258 --> 21:37.257
She'll be back.

21:37.258 --> 21:40.257
I'd love to know
what the old tinker's up to.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.257
Thank you.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.425
For what?

21:42.426 --> 21:44.717
I wasn't sure what I was expecting,
but it wasn't this.

21:44.718 --> 21:48.093
I'm simply observing the decencies.

21:53.258 --> 21:55.925
Lunchtime!
Already?

21:55.926 --> 21:59.257
Your mamma wants it now in case
Jack arrives early for Gilda.

21:59.258 --> 22:01.257
I know what I want for lunch.
Come on!

22:01.258 --> 22:03.257
One kiss!
No!

22:03.258 --> 22:05.257
Just one.
We can't.

22:05.258 --> 22:07.258
No-one's watching.

22:11.258 --> 22:14.257
Father Joe says
God's always watching.

22:14.258 --> 22:16.257
You want me to be a good
Catholic wife, don't you?

22:16.258 --> 22:18.092
Well, not too good.

22:18.093 --> 22:20.593
Come on. Eh! Shirt.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.257
We shouldn't really make jokes
like that.

22:24.258 --> 22:27.257
Like what?
About God, Father Joe.

22:27.258 --> 22:32.257
It was just a joke.
I know, but God's listening.

22:32.258 --> 22:35.257
Do you really believe that?
Of course.

22:35.258 --> 22:39.257
You really believe God's listening
to what everyone says?

22:39.258 --> 22:40.760
God is everything.

22:42.258 --> 22:46.257
What if I can't believe that?
Well, you will.

22:46.258 --> 22:48.257
But what if I can't?

22:48.258 --> 22:52.257
A lot of what Father Joe said
seemed sort of silly.

22:52.258 --> 22:55.257
Don't say that. Never say that
in front of my ma and papa.

22:55.258 --> 22:58.760
I wouldn't, but if I can't be honest
about it with you...

23:01.258 --> 23:03.258
You will try your hardest,
won't you?

23:04.258 --> 23:06.257
It's for you. Of course I will.

23:06.258 --> 23:10.258
Well, then... you will believe.

23:13.258 --> 23:15.257
Yeah?

23:15.258 --> 23:16.258
Car's waiting.

23:23.593 --> 23:29.257
George, I'm rather enjoying
your sister spending time with us,

23:29.258 --> 23:31.257
but would you invite her here
while I'm away?

23:31.258 --> 23:33.592
I'd like her to feel
part of the family again.

23:33.593 --> 23:35.258
I'll see what I can do.

23:37.258 --> 23:39.257
And if she asks,
perhaps you could say

23:39.258 --> 23:41.258
I'd be pleased to find her
still here when I return.

23:41.259 --> 23:43.425
Why don't you tell her?

23:43.426 --> 23:46.257
I think it might register more
coming from you.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.092
I'd be happy to.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.257
Right, well,
I'll telephone when I've seen James.

23:50.258 --> 23:53.257
Shall I give him your...?
Encouragement? Naturally.

23:53.258 --> 23:54.258
George...

23:55.258 --> 23:57.258
..and your love?

23:59.258 --> 24:02.257
Whatever abhorrence
we share for James' nature,

24:02.258 --> 24:03.593
we must never lose sight of that.

24:07.258 --> 24:10.257
He was the most dreadful snob
as a boy!

24:10.258 --> 24:14.257
He spent his childhood chanting,
"I'm the king of the castle

24:14.258 --> 24:16.257
"and you're the dirty rascal!"
Our George?

24:16.258 --> 24:18.258
He grew into his egalitarian ways.

24:20.258 --> 24:22.257
I was just saying how elitist
you were, brother dear.

24:22.258 --> 24:24.257
Don't listen to a word she says.

24:24.258 --> 24:25.257
She is absolutely right,

24:25.258 --> 24:29.257
but someone had to compensate
for your ragtag ways, my darling.

24:29.258 --> 24:30.418
Please sit down, both of you.

24:32.258 --> 24:35.257
I have enjoyed
our brief time together.

24:35.258 --> 24:37.257
You always enjoy
our brief times together.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.257
I mean it.

24:39.258 --> 24:41.257
Miss Adams,
I shall see you upon my return.

24:41.258 --> 24:43.258
You will.

24:48.258 --> 24:51.257
She invites you in, then scarpers.

24:51.258 --> 24:54.258
She's definitely up to something,
trust me.

24:58.258 --> 25:01.257
I am sorry to bother you
on a Sunday, Doctor.

25:01.258 --> 25:03.257
He doesn't mind. Do you, Jack?

25:03.258 --> 25:05.257
Sickness doesn't recognise weekends.

25:05.258 --> 25:06.259
Painful?

25:08.258 --> 25:09.258
Mumps.

25:10.258 --> 25:13.257
Well, you've all had it
so no-one's at risk.

25:13.258 --> 25:17.258
Bed rest and aspirin for the pain
and fever should see her right.

25:18.258 --> 25:20.257
Miss Carolyn!

25:20.258 --> 25:21.258
Mamma!

25:21.259 --> 25:24.093
Si, tesoro! Vengo!
Got to dash.

25:33.258 --> 25:35.257
Ignoring me is one thing.
Avoiding me is childish.

25:35.258 --> 25:37.759
What do you expect?
Better than this.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.593
What's left to say?
Unless you want to say who she is.

25:42.258 --> 25:44.258
So, there's nothing to talk about.

25:54.258 --> 25:56.257
So, how was mass?

25:56.258 --> 25:58.257
What was that about?

25:58.258 --> 26:00.257
Oh, nearly had a bingle earlier.

26:00.258 --> 26:02.425
Told him to brush up
on his road rules.

26:02.426 --> 26:04.257
So, mass?

26:04.258 --> 26:08.058
Well, I was a pretend Anglican
and now I'm a pretend Catholic.

26:08.073 --> 26:10.073
It's easy to change a belief
you never had!

27:13.073 --> 27:16.073
Hello. Ah, there's the person
I should be meeting.

27:22.073 --> 27:24.773
I've ordered tea.
Oh, thank you.

27:24.850 --> 27:26.366
I'm parched after that long drive.

27:28.073 --> 27:29.072
Well...?

27:29.073 --> 27:31.072
I'm leaving tonight.

27:31.073 --> 27:35.072
I already have investigators at work
in Paris, London and Berlin.

27:35.073 --> 27:37.072
One thing that can be said
for the Nazis -

27:37.073 --> 27:39.073
they kept meticulous records.

27:41.575 --> 27:43.574
And £1,000 should suffice?

27:43.575 --> 27:46.073
No expense spared, you said.

27:47.073 --> 27:50.072
I expect results
well within three months.

27:50.073 --> 27:51.907
Splendid.

27:51.908 --> 27:53.509
So, how is it
having her under your roof?

27:55.073 --> 27:57.072
She's assimilating too well.

27:57.073 --> 28:00.072
George needs to see her
in the context of the wider world.

28:00.073 --> 28:02.072
Why do you think I'm here?

28:02.073 --> 28:07.073
First, James and Olivia and then
I have some arrangements to make.

28:10.073 --> 28:12.072
The patient's grandmother
is on her way.

28:12.073 --> 28:14.072
I thought no visitors.

28:14.073 --> 28:16.907
She's clearly unfamiliar
with the word 'no'.

28:16.908 --> 28:19.072
Get him cleaned up,
tidy up the room,

28:19.073 --> 28:21.908
a bowl of fruit
and some fresh flowers.

28:22.793 --> 28:24.073
And heavier sedation.

28:33.280 --> 28:37.279
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm so glad you're here.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.280
I felt rather alone.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.279
I do understand.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.279
You've shown great fortitude,

28:44.280 --> 28:46.947
which can only serve
to strengthen James's resolve.

28:46.948 --> 28:49.279
How can it,
when I'm not permitted to see him?

28:49.280 --> 28:51.279
The doctors know best.

28:51.280 --> 28:54.279
They treat me
as if I were a liability.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.279
The medical profession
can often be undiplomatic.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.279
We're spoiled by Jack.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.279
Right, now,
perhaps if you wait here...

29:00.280 --> 29:03.279
No, I'm coming in with you.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.880
Oh, Olivia, you must not
get yourself worked up in a state.

29:05.929 --> 29:08.928
Being fobbed off by them
is one thing.

29:08.929 --> 29:10.929
I will not be fobbed off by you.

29:12.929 --> 29:14.763
Very well.

29:14.764 --> 29:17.929
But you must promise to abide by the
doctor's decision, whatever it is.

29:21.929 --> 29:24.597
What if he tries to deter you?

29:25.929 --> 29:27.928
I must repeat,
we usually restrict visitors

29:27.929 --> 29:29.928
at this stage of the treatment.

29:29.929 --> 29:31.928
Well, I fail to see
how assuring James

29:31.929 --> 29:34.763
that he has my full support
could be counter-productive.

29:34.764 --> 29:36.928
Then you need to be prepared.

29:36.929 --> 29:38.928
To the untrained eye,
his appearance is confronting.

29:38.929 --> 29:41.596
Mrs Bligh was unable
to contain herself.

29:41.597 --> 29:44.928
It is very distressing
to see him like this.

29:44.929 --> 29:46.928
But it is all part of the process.

29:46.929 --> 29:50.928
The worst thing for James would be
for you to curtail his treatment

29:50.929 --> 29:53.096
based on an emotional reaction.

29:53.097 --> 29:54.929
You misjudge me, Doctor.

29:54.930 --> 29:58.430
Rest assured,
James will see a calm, smiling face.

29:58.431 --> 30:01.596
Very well. Yeah, but only you.

30:01.597 --> 30:02.929
You understand.

30:17.929 --> 30:20.928
He appears to have been burnt.

30:20.929 --> 30:22.929
We are administering
electroshock therapy

30:22.930 --> 30:25.263
and we'll be moving on
to aversion therapy -

30:25.264 --> 30:28.928
an emetic administered while he's
shown images conducive to arousal.

30:28.929 --> 30:30.596
I see.

30:30.597 --> 30:32.929
I know what you must
be going through.

30:33.930 --> 30:35.929
I think not.

30:40.929 --> 30:42.928
It's alright, darling boy.
I've come to visit.

30:42.929 --> 30:44.929
James, James.

30:46.597 --> 30:48.097
I'm so proud of you, James.

30:50.929 --> 30:52.928
Why is he so heavily sedated?

30:52.929 --> 30:55.928
The conscious mind of the invert
resists being challenged

30:55.929 --> 30:57.096
so we sedate him
after each treatment

30:57.097 --> 30:59.928
to allow the subconscious free rein.

30:59.929 --> 31:02.928
Now he is getting agitated.
This is what I was concerned about.

31:02.929 --> 31:04.928
James, James, shh.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.928
It's alright.

31:06.929 --> 31:10.929
I insisted that I see you,
but I promised not to stay.

31:11.929 --> 31:14.928
Will you be strong, my darling?

31:14.929 --> 31:16.929
For Olivia and for the baby?

31:17.929 --> 31:19.929
James?

31:21.097 --> 31:22.264
Love you.

31:40.929 --> 31:43.430
What did he say?

31:43.431 --> 31:44.929
Sounded like, "I love you too."

31:53.929 --> 31:56.596
You are to be congratulated
for putting the patient's wellbeing

31:56.597 --> 31:58.929
ahead of your own
understandable distress.

32:02.929 --> 32:05.928
You do understand that your grandson
cannot move beyond his malady

32:05.929 --> 32:07.928
without a level of discomfort.

32:07.929 --> 32:11.928
Well, I rely on you, Doctor,
to keep his discomfort to a minimum.

32:11.929 --> 32:14.929
This is the 1950s, Mrs Bligh,
not the Middle Ages.

32:15.929 --> 32:17.929
What did James say?

32:18.929 --> 32:21.431
Something I rarely hear these days.

32:47.929 --> 32:51.431
Have you broken down
or stopped running?

32:52.929 --> 32:54.597
I deserve that.

32:55.929 --> 32:56.928
I do understand.

32:56.929 --> 32:58.929
You can't.

33:00.597 --> 33:02.436
Not without knowing
a lot more than you do.

33:03.097 --> 33:04.430
About...?

33:04.431 --> 33:05.929
Me.

33:07.929 --> 33:10.431
But I'm here to hear your story.

33:13.929 --> 33:15.928
I'd always had a crush on you.

33:15.929 --> 33:18.929
I used to wait
for your visits to Mother.

33:19.929 --> 33:20.929
I had no idea.

33:22.929 --> 33:25.097
I was shy.
You? Shy?

33:26.431 --> 33:27.929
I was then.

33:29.929 --> 33:32.928
So, I was desperate to see you
when I got to uni.

33:32.929 --> 33:34.764
I thought I had to work to get you.

33:36.929 --> 33:37.929
I did love you.

33:39.929 --> 33:40.929
Truly.

33:43.929 --> 33:45.929
I loved you.

33:50.097 --> 33:51.928
I would have stood by you.

33:51.929 --> 33:54.928
And lost Mother's support?
We'd have managed.

33:54.929 --> 33:58.929
You were a brilliant student.
You relied on her.

34:00.929 --> 34:03.096
I wasn't going to risk that.
Well, I should have had the choice.

34:03.097 --> 34:05.929
My life is peppered
with 'should haves'.

34:08.929 --> 34:13.264
So, I disappeared...

34:15.929 --> 34:17.969
..I had our child and gave her away
and here we are.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.929
I did it all for you.

34:29.929 --> 34:31.929
But you have every right
to be angry.

34:50.097 --> 34:53.721
I'm just heading out to visit Roy.
I promised him a cup of tea.

34:53.722 --> 34:56.282
Would you like me to drive you?
No, no, the ride will do me good.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.928
I've just started drawing up
a guest list.

34:59.929 --> 35:00.928
For...?

35:00.929 --> 35:02.929
Our engagement party.

35:04.929 --> 35:06.097
While the cat's away...

35:07.597 --> 35:08.928
I thought a bush dance.

35:08.929 --> 35:11.928
A bush dance?
With a bush band.

35:11.929 --> 35:13.096
A refreshing change
from the string quartets

35:13.097 --> 35:14.928
that normally grace our parties.

35:14.929 --> 35:15.928
How would your mother feel
about that?

35:15.929 --> 35:16.928
I think she'll be happy

35:16.929 --> 35:18.928
not being swept into a Pride of Erin
with the locals.

35:18.929 --> 35:20.930
Aren't you early?

35:22.597 --> 35:23.928
Hurry back.

35:23.929 --> 35:24.929
Soon as I can.

35:27.929 --> 35:29.597
You do like the idea?

35:30.722 --> 35:31.929
I love it.

36:12.929 --> 36:14.929
It's brewed up things for me too.

36:19.929 --> 36:21.264
I was in the Resistance.

36:22.722 --> 36:23.929
I shot a wounded friend.

36:27.722 --> 36:29.928
It was that or leave her
to be tortured by the Gestapo

36:29.929 --> 36:31.928
before they killed her anyway.

36:31.929 --> 36:35.431
If the right outweighs the wrong,
no matter how wrong...

36:36.929 --> 36:38.089
..you'll face your God again.

36:39.929 --> 36:40.929
Eventually.

36:56.930 --> 37:00.431
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name

37:01.929 --> 37:05.928
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven

37:05.929 --> 37:07.928
Give us this day our daily bread

37:07.929 --> 37:09.263
And forgive us our trespasses

37:09.264 --> 37:11.928
as we forgive those
who trespass against us

37:11.929 --> 37:13.929
And lead us not into temptation...

37:14.929 --> 37:16.889
What if our daughter
hadn't found out about you?

37:17.929 --> 37:19.929
She did.
Yeah, but if she hadn't?

37:21.929 --> 37:22.929
We wouldn't be here.

37:25.929 --> 37:28.431
I'd never have known.
No.

37:29.889 --> 37:31.930
There ARE reasons.
Yeah, so you keep saying.

37:34.929 --> 37:36.096
I need more.

37:36.097 --> 37:37.928
No.

37:37.929 --> 37:39.928
I deserve more.
I can't.

37:39.929 --> 37:41.929
It's my right to know her.

37:48.597 --> 37:49.722
Please...

37:51.597 --> 37:52.929
..tell me.

37:54.722 --> 37:55.929
Who is she?

37:59.722 --> 38:01.264
If you ever loved me...

38:06.889 --> 38:07.929
Anna.

38:11.929 --> 38:13.929
My Anna.

38:14.929 --> 38:16.264
Our Anna.

38:26.810 --> 38:28.908
Mrs Bligh, what a pleasure.

38:28.934 --> 38:29.933
Andrew!

38:29.934 --> 38:32.933
Elizabeth's come to visit James.

38:32.934 --> 38:35.601
Do sit down.
Where are you staying?

38:35.602 --> 38:38.934
Well, here.
Not any longer.

38:38.935 --> 38:41.933
Mother sent me
to insist you be our house guest.

38:41.934 --> 38:43.101
I insist you join her.

38:43.102 --> 38:44.933
Oh, I'm not sure that would...

38:44.934 --> 38:46.933
Olivia tells me
you've been very understanding.

38:46.934 --> 38:48.726
About James?
Mm-hm.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.933
Of course.
Some sort of rest cure, yes?

38:50.934 --> 38:52.134
Thank you for your discretion.

38:52.934 --> 38:54.933
Actually, I was intending
to visit your mother

38:54.934 --> 38:56.726
so your invitation's very timely.

38:56.727 --> 39:00.268
To see her for...?
A private matter.

39:00.269 --> 39:01.933
It's perfect, then.

39:01.934 --> 39:03.933
Did Olivia happen to mention

39:03.934 --> 39:06.933
I'm storing pennies in heaven
to aid my cause with Anna?

39:06.934 --> 39:07.934
No, she didn't.

39:08.934 --> 39:10.933
I've decided to press my advantage.

39:10.934 --> 39:13.334
I'll pop down to Ash Park
once you've settled in with Mother.

39:13.934 --> 39:16.726
Well, perhaps not for a few days.

39:16.727 --> 39:18.934
We need to give Anna
plenty of notice, don't you think?

39:28.934 --> 39:31.934
Instruction. Father Joe.

39:32.934 --> 39:34.934
Coming.

39:43.934 --> 39:45.933
I promise not
to go blundering in with her.

39:45.934 --> 39:47.934
Thank you.

39:51.934 --> 39:56.894
I'm moving into the main house
while Mother's away, if you want me.

39:59.934 --> 40:02.933
I've only had one conversation
alone with her ever.

40:02.934 --> 40:03.934
Recently.

40:05.934 --> 40:08.933
A railway station platform,
of all places.

40:08.934 --> 40:12.601
Thank you for trusting me.

40:12.602 --> 40:14.893
Finally.

40:14.894 --> 40:16.933
Better late than never.

40:16.934 --> 40:18.934
Yes.

40:23.934 --> 40:25.933
I'll look after the place
till you sell.

40:25.934 --> 40:26.933
You've done enough already.

40:26.934 --> 40:30.268
You'll never get your price
if it goes to the pack.

40:30.269 --> 40:31.933
Good luck, lass.

40:31.934 --> 40:33.055
You look after your mum, eh?

40:36.934 --> 40:39.933
Try to forget this ever happened.

40:39.934 --> 40:41.934
Won't be easy.
Do it for him.

40:44.934 --> 40:45.934
Bye, sweetie.

40:51.934 --> 40:53.934
Colin?

40:55.935 --> 40:57.934
Colin?

40:59.934 --> 41:01.934
You were protecting your mum.

41:03.102 --> 41:05.269
You did nothing wrong.

42:53.225 --> 43:43.351
