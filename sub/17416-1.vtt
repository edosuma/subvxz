00:41.216 --> 00:43.256
Bravo over looking,
moving into position.

00:44.616 --> 00:47.096
'Waiting on Gold. Order imminent.'

00:48.176 --> 00:51.776
Southern 156 standing by.
Bravo seconds away.

00:53.056 --> 00:55.055
'Alpha, sit rep.'

00:55.056 --> 00:57.655
We're in, going up.

00:57.656 --> 00:59.535
Alpha in the building.

00:59.536 --> 01:01.896
ETA less than a minute.
We need a decision.

01:03.456 --> 01:05.856
Southern 156,
still waiting on the order.

01:07.856 --> 01:10.096
'Fifth floor.'

01:12.656 --> 01:15.376
Southern 156,
Bravo, are you visual?

01:16.736 --> 01:18.416
Negative.

01:20.936 --> 01:22.615
Where's that bloody order?

01:22.616 --> 01:26.415
'Southern 156, Gold has signed off
on Health and Safety.

01:26.416 --> 01:30.095
'We need you to complete the Risk
Assessment. We need that paperwork.'

01:30.096 --> 01:31.496
It's done.

01:32.936 --> 01:34.856

01:58.896 --> 02:01.535
What the hell, where's the...?

02:01.536 --> 02:03.776
Just go, flat 56. Flat 56.

02:17.616 --> 02:19.856
He's armed.

02:45.736 --> 02:48.296
All units, shots fired, shots fired.

02:52.536 --> 02:54.456
Get down, don't move!

02:55.976 --> 02:58.696
Jesus Christ! There's no bomb, Col!
There's no bloody bomb!

04:01.536 --> 04:03.536
With me, now!

04:12.816 --> 04:14.696
It's clear, Sarge.

04:52.336 --> 04:54.016
Come on.

05:11.216 --> 05:14.095
You got to the flat. You shouted,
"Armed police."

05:14.096 --> 05:17.935
You heard something going on inside,
a struggle, a fight or something.

05:17.936 --> 05:19.935
Southern 156 gave you
the order to go in.

05:19.936 --> 05:22.215
The suspect's there,
he's acting aggressive.

05:22.216 --> 05:25.175
You shout,
"Surrender, armed police."

05:25.176 --> 05:28.015
The suspect doesn't comply.
He comes for you.

05:28.016 --> 05:29.495
You've got no choice.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.695
I've got kids of my own, sir.
If I could do anything different...

05:32.696 --> 05:37.335
I want those statements
copper-plated by noon. Got it?

05:37.336 --> 05:39.016
Yes, sir.

05:49.696 --> 05:52.255
I take pride in the courage and
professionalism

05:52.256 --> 05:54.695
of my counterterrorism officers.

05:54.696 --> 05:57.856
To say any more risks prejudicing
the inquest. Thank you.

06:01.896 --> 06:04.255
When Karim Ali came to this country,

06:04.256 --> 06:06.576
he told his wife that here
it would be different.

06:06.577 --> 06:09.255
The police don't break into
houses and hurt innocent people.

06:09.256 --> 06:12.176
He told her that in England
the police are good men.

06:15.776 --> 06:19.815
This is a complex and emotive case.

06:19.816 --> 06:22.895
Following depositions from
legal representatives,

06:22.896 --> 06:26.135
I grant a period of six weeks

06:26.136 --> 06:28.935
to gather all relevant evidence
and statements.

06:28.936 --> 06:31.655
This inquest is hereby adjourned.

06:31.656 --> 06:34.696
All rise for Her Majesty's Coroner.

06:40.896 --> 06:43.296
What the bloody hell is this?

06:45.496 --> 06:47.136
They misread the number on the door.

06:47.137 --> 06:49.895
They mistook a baby sling
for a bomb harness.

06:49.896 --> 06:53.775
I ordered that you corroborate that
the firearms squad observed
threatening behaviour.

06:53.776 --> 06:57.335
We watched the flat for two weeks,
then got scrambled with
an hour's notice.

06:57.336 --> 07:00.575
The op was well planned and executed.
It was a runaway train.

07:00.576 --> 07:02.375
Admit our mistake, apologise

07:02.376 --> 07:05.375
and get on with the job of finding
the actual terrorists.

07:05.376 --> 07:06.935
You're blaming your own.

07:06.936 --> 07:09.695
It took guts for them to go in there
thinking a suicide bomber

07:09.696 --> 07:11.215
was going to blow them to pieces.

07:11.216 --> 07:13.096
Then write the same statement
they did.

07:13.097 --> 07:16.176
An innocent man was killed, sir,
I won't lie.

07:17.616 --> 07:21.735
You passed on the order. Where were
your reservations when it mattered?

07:21.736 --> 07:23.416
You're finished.

07:40.096 --> 07:42.736
'You passed on the order.'

07:50.176 --> 07:53.256
'Where were your reservations
when it mattered?'

07:57.856 --> 08:00.896
'You're finished.'

08:13.136 --> 08:14.655
Is it Steven or Steve?

08:14.656 --> 08:17.896
Steve. Thanks for accepting
the offer, Steve.

08:22.656 --> 08:25.335
Welcome to Anticorruption.
As you can see,

08:25.336 --> 08:27.975
we've got a number of active
investigations at present.

08:27.976 --> 08:29.336
Why are there empty desks?

08:30.376 --> 08:32.575
You should look at this
as a promotion, Steve.

08:32.576 --> 08:35.174
If you want to get
anywhere in the job these days,

08:35.176 --> 08:37.576
Anticorruption's a big tick
on the old CV.

08:38.576 --> 08:39.936
This will be good for me.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.335
That's the ticket.

08:41.336 --> 08:43.534
Your shooting...

08:43.535 --> 08:46.775
have you any idea how many people
have died as a direct result

08:46.776 --> 08:49.415
of police action in the last
ten years, Steve?

08:49.416 --> 08:50.575
No, I don't.

08:50.576 --> 08:54.095
Well, as with all firearms incidents
it's gone upstairs to the IPCC.

08:54.096 --> 08:57.135
But Karim Ali,
the man who was accidentally killed,

08:57.136 --> 08:59.096
he's an illegal immigrant.

09:00.296 --> 09:02.136
So is his missus.

09:04.976 --> 09:06.496
It wasn't your fault, son.

09:08.376 --> 09:10.095
A clean break. Pastures new.

09:10.096 --> 09:11.296
Come on.

09:12.536 --> 09:15.016
I've a very special case for you.

09:20.256 --> 09:22.375
'Hello.'

09:22.376 --> 09:25.415
Hey, it's me. I'm on my way.

09:25.416 --> 09:29.975
I will be there in five minutes,
I promise.

09:29.976 --> 09:31.895
'OK.'

09:31.896 --> 09:35.416
Woah. Plod. Better make that ten.

09:40.296 --> 09:43.175
I brought my business trip
forward to today.

09:43.176 --> 09:45.016
I'm sorry about tonight. No...

09:47.576 --> 09:52.215
It's your night. Only the most
glamorous night of the year.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.136
Yeah. Hardly.

09:55.416 --> 09:57.816
What are you going to do
to make it up to me?

09:59.776 --> 10:01.216
Fancy a bacon bap?

10:02.976 --> 10:06.415
Next you'll be trying to get me on
the back seat of your Ford Capri.

10:06.416 --> 10:09.776
And those were the days, eh?
God, I miss that car.

10:13.456 --> 10:17.136
I'll call you if I get back before
it's too late. OK.

10:19.736 --> 10:21.616
I think...

10:22.856 --> 10:25.896
we could just dash back to yours
before you have to go.

10:33.696 --> 10:35.295
Tony...

10:35.296 --> 10:37.696
Help! Help!

10:41.856 --> 10:44.056
Hey. Hey.

10:56.776 --> 10:58.575
You OK, darling?

10:58.576 --> 11:00.935
You OK? Stay there!

11:00.936 --> 11:03.415
Is the baby OK? Yeah.
The police are coming.

11:03.416 --> 11:05.056
They're already here.

11:06.136 --> 11:07.896
On the house.

11:09.856 --> 11:11.215
Thank you.

11:11.216 --> 11:15.055
Officer of the year
Detective Chief Inspector...

11:15.056 --> 11:16.696
Anthony Gates.

11:28.016 --> 11:32.335
Tony Gates returns the best
crime figures in the Job.

11:32.336 --> 11:36.296
No-one's that good.
What's his secret, Steve?

11:45.456 --> 11:48.935
He'll be after your job next, Derek.
Or yours, sir!

11:48.936 --> 11:52.215
Oh, I don't think so. I think I've
reached my level, sir.

11:52.216 --> 11:56.016
Any higher and I'll actually have to
read those Home Office e-mails, eh?

11:57.176 --> 11:59.856
Would you excuse me, please? Sir.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.415
Jackie.

12:05.416 --> 12:07.895
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

12:07.896 --> 12:09.776
What's going on?

12:22.536 --> 12:24.855
Tony, thank God.

12:24.856 --> 12:27.775
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I've ruined
your night,

12:27.776 --> 12:30.975
I'm really sorry... Hey, hey.

12:30.976 --> 12:33.055
No, no, we are going to be calm
and clear-headed

12:33.056 --> 12:35.376
and then maybe I'll be able
to help you.

12:39.376 --> 12:41.175
As soon as we agreed the deal,

12:41.176 --> 12:43.535
someone cracked open
a bottle of champagne.

12:43.536 --> 12:46.215
OK, how much did you have?

12:46.216 --> 12:47.855
We went on to a wine bar...

12:47.856 --> 12:50.456
Oh, Christ, Jackie.

12:53.496 --> 12:55.015
I've been a bloody idiot.

12:55.016 --> 12:56.616
Just tell me what happened?

13:00.696 --> 13:02.416
I hit something.

13:05.096 --> 13:07.175
What?

13:07.176 --> 13:09.415
The road was dark, I don't know,

13:09.416 --> 13:12.375
I thought it was a sign or
a bollard or something...

13:12.376 --> 13:14.575
Jackie, what did you hit?

13:14.576 --> 13:16.335
A dog.

13:16.336 --> 13:18.815
A...a dog? Yeah.

13:18.816 --> 13:20.415
You'll be fine.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.815
People round here,
they report everything.

13:22.816 --> 13:25.495
What if someone saw my car?
I'm known.

13:25.496 --> 13:27.095
You're overreacting, that's all.

13:27.096 --> 13:28.935
I was drinking all night...

13:28.936 --> 13:31.856
the bar staff,
they saw what I was putting away.

13:34.096 --> 13:35.656
Where's your car?

13:37.176 --> 13:41.416
Tony. I've already got
a conviction for drink driving.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.816
One more and I go to prison.

13:47.176 --> 13:48.895
Where's your car?

13:48.896 --> 13:51.135
I called you.
And you didn't answer...

13:51.136 --> 13:53.096
Jackie!

13:56.096 --> 13:57.736
I reported it stolen.

14:01.256 --> 14:04.255
It's an 80-grand motor with
an immobiliser, Jackie.

14:04.256 --> 14:06.136
They'd need the keys.
Where are the keys?

14:06.137 --> 14:08.095
I'm sorry, I... I panicked.

14:08.096 --> 14:10.016
Where are the keys?!

14:14.936 --> 14:18.016
I don't know... Here.

14:31.456 --> 14:33.016
OK.

14:41.176 --> 14:43.696
What are you going to do?

15:03.256 --> 15:04.816
Thank you.

16:02.096 --> 16:05.935
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
That's OK.

16:05.936 --> 16:08.015
How'd it go?

16:08.016 --> 16:10.056
It was brilliant.

16:11.856 --> 16:13.936
I'm so proud of you.

16:37.536 --> 16:41.255
Mr Butterfield. I'm Detective
Constable Kate Fleming, Central CID.

16:41.256 --> 16:43.216
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

16:44.616 --> 16:48.095
First let me say how bad I feel
for what's happened to you.

16:48.096 --> 16:51.375
It must have been a very frightening
experience. How are you feeling?

16:51.376 --> 16:54.015
Well, I... I just want
something done.

16:54.016 --> 16:57.455
It'd really help us
empathise with your experience, sir,

16:57.456 --> 16:59.015
if we heard it firsthand.

16:59.016 --> 17:01.975
What? Well, I came in today
because I thought you'd...

17:01.976 --> 17:03.575
you'd made some progress.

17:03.576 --> 17:05.694
I'm sorry, Mr Butterfield,
but unless we have

17:05.695 --> 17:09.095
hard physical evidence that leads to
an offender, it's very difficult...

17:09.096 --> 17:12.015
Well, I've been burgled three times
this year already.

17:12.016 --> 17:15.055
Every time, it's someone new,
who's been given the file

17:15.056 --> 17:17.736
and who wants to "empathise"
all over again.

17:18.736 --> 17:21.454
Mr Butterfield, just wait.

17:21.455 --> 17:24.494
If you can just take my number,
you can call me day or night.

17:24.496 --> 17:27.855
Let's see what we can do
to get them this time.

17:27.856 --> 17:29.896
Yeah. Thank you.

17:38.336 --> 17:41.695
DC Kate Fleming to see you, sir.

17:41.696 --> 17:43.416
Thank you.

17:45.416 --> 17:47.175
You wanted to see me, sir?

17:47.176 --> 17:49.415
Er, there's a crime number,

17:49.416 --> 17:53.895
DCI Gates' double-arrest outside
a cafe in Kingsgate.

17:53.896 --> 17:56.215
Yeah, I processed the arrests, sir.

17:56.216 --> 18:00.895
Robbery, assault with weapon
with intent to rob,

18:00.896 --> 18:04.735
possession of prohibited weapon,
resisting arrest, all times-two.

18:04.736 --> 18:06.215
Yes, sir.

18:06.216 --> 18:08.495
Two offenders, but only one knife.

18:08.496 --> 18:11.455
You see my point, Kate?

18:11.456 --> 18:14.815
They didn't both use a knife.
There was an opportunity here

18:14.816 --> 18:18.095
with one of the offenders
to miss out the knife altogether.

18:18.096 --> 18:21.455
Well, I took the view
they were both involved, sir.

18:21.456 --> 18:24.455
Divisional commanders are on notice
to reduce knife crime.

18:24.456 --> 18:28.655
They say Hillside Lane have
already achieved 5%.

18:28.656 --> 18:31.096
Do you want me to re-crime it, sir?

18:33.256 --> 18:37.256
It's not my policy to intercede
in individual offences.

18:38.576 --> 18:43.375
Now, CID has an unacceptable
detection rate. Your case
this morning is a prime example.

18:43.376 --> 18:45.815
Multiple domestic burglaries?

18:45.816 --> 18:48.975
We pursue two out of three
reported crimes.

18:48.976 --> 18:52.695
We down-process anything that won't
quickly lead to an offender.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.975
Are you ordering me
to put it on the back-burner?

18:55.976 --> 19:00.096
You're not the new girl
any more, Kate.

19:01.976 --> 19:04.016
Thank you, sir.

19:09.976 --> 19:14.455
Officer of the Year isn't good
enough for the boss. He's after
the middleweight title.

19:14.456 --> 19:17.496
I heard they gave you more than
a free breakfast.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.215
Steady there, son.

19:20.216 --> 19:22.935
Ta, Deepak. Down here, mate.
Right, cheers, mate.

19:22.936 --> 19:26.135
Right, ABH. Alcoholic IP...

19:26.136 --> 19:27.615
Uh-huh!

19:27.616 --> 19:32.495
Oh, can't remember a thing about the
offender except he might've been
called Pete. Brilliant.

19:32.496 --> 19:35.616
No other witnesses. Twist.

19:37.296 --> 19:39.655
Er, car-jacking.

19:39.656 --> 19:43.735
CCTV showing registration plates,
reliable witnesses.

19:43.736 --> 19:48.175
That's aggravated vehicle-taking,
going equipped to steal,

19:48.176 --> 19:51.295
causing danger to other road users,
criminal damage, affray

19:51.296 --> 19:53.655
and putting people in fear
of violence.

19:53.656 --> 19:55.975
Full house, boss. Nice one. Stick.

19:55.976 --> 19:57.415
Er, yeah.

19:57.416 --> 20:03.055
DOA found early this morning
by dog-walker, side of the road.

20:03.056 --> 20:06.855
Bound to be a hit-and-run.
Turf it to Traffic, boss? Yeah.

20:06.856 --> 20:08.336
Where was the body found?

20:08.337 --> 20:10.815
Er... Edge Park.

20:10.816 --> 20:13.456
Back road off Millionaires' Row.

20:15.056 --> 20:16.936
Twist it.

20:20.016 --> 20:21.895
Is that it?

20:21.896 --> 20:23.736
Yeah, for now.

20:24.896 --> 20:26.216
OK.

20:27.656 --> 20:30.255
There was a Range Rover
abandoned in a lay-by

20:30.256 --> 20:31.815
about half a mile down the road.

20:31.816 --> 20:34.535
The owner reported it stolen
last night.

20:34.536 --> 20:37.375
Signs at the property suggest
they put a rod through the window

20:37.376 --> 20:38.696
to fish up the keys.

20:40.376 --> 20:42.935
Witnesses? CCTV?

20:42.936 --> 20:46.216
Not a dicky-bird, sir.
Just this woman walking her dog.

20:48.576 --> 20:50.095
What about the DOA?

20:50.096 --> 20:51.216
No ID on his body.

20:53.176 --> 20:55.735
Any reason for the interest, sir?

20:55.736 --> 20:59.816
We just got a tip-off that it
might be connected to
one of our investigations.

21:19.056 --> 21:20.976
What's wrong? What is it?

21:23.136 --> 21:25.575
You didn't kill a dog, Jackie.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.576
You killed a man.

21:28.736 --> 21:30.656
Oh, God.

21:31.656 --> 21:33.495
Oh, my God.

21:33.496 --> 21:37.375
You just go to the police. You
tell 'em exactly what you told me.

21:37.376 --> 21:38.975
No, Tony, I can't...

21:38.976 --> 21:43.655
Oh, yes, you bloody can.
Jackie, a man is dead, and that is
a big problem

21:43.656 --> 21:46.775
but trying to cover it up
is an even bigger one.

21:46.776 --> 21:49.015
Do you understand me?

21:49.016 --> 21:50.975
Jackie, have you got it?

21:50.976 --> 21:54.015
Yes, yes! OK, so you tell
the fewest lies possible.

21:54.016 --> 21:57.095
You say that you panicked
but now you want to come clean.

21:57.096 --> 21:59.375
You got it? Jackie, have you got it?

21:59.376 --> 22:01.055
OK.

22:01.056 --> 22:05.016
Don't call me, and don't bottle it.

22:07.136 --> 22:10.296
I've put the case where
I can keep an eye on it.

22:40.016 --> 22:41.616
So, yeah, should be good...

22:42.856 --> 22:46.055
Hang on, just give me a second,
Steve, all right?

22:46.056 --> 22:48.536
Hello, yeah.

23:04.736 --> 23:07.536
You all right? DS Arnott.

23:08.616 --> 23:09.896
Can I help you?

23:09.897 --> 23:13.376
Er, we're here to see
DCI Gates... Kate.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.735
OK. Erm, have you been posted?

23:17.736 --> 23:19.815
You could say that.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.216
Well, welcome to the Alamo.

23:21.217 --> 23:22.775
Thank you very much.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.736
They said they were getting
this fixed.

23:26.496 --> 23:28.615
Sorry about that, Steve.

23:28.616 --> 23:29.816
No problem.

23:31.896 --> 23:33.216
Are you with AC-12?

23:34.456 --> 23:35.775
Yeah.

23:35.776 --> 23:36.976
Hmm.

23:49.416 --> 23:51.136
Sir.

23:57.616 --> 23:59.295
Sir?

23:59.296 --> 24:02.535
AC-12 are in the building.
Hastings and some snot-nosed DS.

24:02.536 --> 24:05.535
Has a complaint been made
against one of my squad?

24:05.536 --> 24:08.056
I'm afraid it's you personally,
Tony.

24:09.056 --> 24:10.496
Huh.

24:11.496 --> 24:12.895
Any idea why?

24:12.896 --> 24:15.175
No, none at all, sir.

24:15.176 --> 24:17.335
They'll call you in.

24:17.336 --> 24:19.416
Thank you, sir.

24:30.096 --> 24:32.655
Can I get someone to bring you
a tea or coffee, sir?

24:32.656 --> 24:35.015
No, thank you, I'm fine.

24:35.016 --> 24:38.815
DCI Gates. Superintendent Hastings.
Like the battle.

24:38.816 --> 24:40.536
I know who you are, sir.

24:43.856 --> 24:45.535
And this is DS Steve Arnott.

24:45.536 --> 24:48.096
Pleased to meet you, sir. Likewise.

24:50.176 --> 24:54.535
I recognise and respect
the importance of your mission

24:54.536 --> 24:58.015
and I'm very happy to help you
in any way I can.

24:58.016 --> 25:00.695
Well, now, that's very reassuring.
Can I call you Tony?

25:00.696 --> 25:03.135
Whatever you feel
most comfortable with, sir.

25:03.136 --> 25:06.775
Maybe I should call you
Officer of the Year, eh?

25:06.776 --> 25:08.495
Shall we make a start?

25:08.496 --> 25:10.016
Yes, please.

25:11.216 --> 25:13.015
AC-12 interview.

25:13.016 --> 25:16.576
Present - Superintendent Hastings,
DS Arnott and DCI Gates.

25:18.896 --> 25:21.175
Detective Chief Inspector Gates,

25:21.176 --> 25:24.615
we have received an allegation that
you received a gratuity

25:24.616 --> 25:29.495
in respect of one free breakfast
from the Sunflower Cafe in
St Anne's Place, in the Kingsgate.

25:29.496 --> 25:32.215
Now, whilst receiving a gratuity
is not in itself a breach,

25:32.216 --> 25:35.175
failure to declare a said gratuity
is a breach

25:35.176 --> 25:38.215
of the police officer's
code of conduct as laid down

25:38.216 --> 25:39.855
by the Home Office guidelines.

25:39.856 --> 25:44.656
And so therefore I am serving you
with the yellow notice.

25:48.176 --> 25:49.335
And that's it?

25:49.336 --> 25:50.536
Yes, that's it.

25:53.896 --> 25:58.695
In which case, erm, I decline to
make any written or oral statement

25:58.696 --> 26:01.176
but I acknowledge
the receipt of the yellow notice

26:01.177 --> 26:07.135
and I inform the investigating
officer that I will respond within
the regulation ten working days.

26:07.136 --> 26:09.296
Interview terminated.

26:11.416 --> 26:16.775
This is coming from the muggers,
isn't it? Those toe-rags know
every trick in the book.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.455
Er, well, we have to go through
the motions, Tony, you know.

26:19.456 --> 26:21.056
It's not your fault, sir.

26:29.456 --> 26:32.495
He's an arrogant so-and-so,
isn't he?

26:32.496 --> 26:37.215
I mean, a player like Gates knows
it's against rules and regulations
not to declare a gratuity

26:37.216 --> 26:41.415
so what does it say about him
that he doesn't even bother his arse
to fill in the form?

26:41.416 --> 26:43.975
Well, with respect, what's a free
breakfast got to do with

26:43.976 --> 26:46.735
investigating Gates' crime figures?

26:46.736 --> 26:51.575
Sooner or later he's going to know
we're on to him. This way, he thinks
it's just a storm in a teacup.

26:51.576 --> 26:53.176
Or should that be a coffee cup?

26:55.176 --> 26:58.895
I'll give him laughing all over
his face at us. His guard's down.

26:58.896 --> 27:02.135
That's how we're going to
get him, Steve.

27:02.136 --> 27:03.975
There's another possibility.

27:03.976 --> 27:05.215
Yeah?

27:05.216 --> 27:06.696
Gates' figures are for real.

27:07.736 --> 27:09.335
Oh, I see what you're getting at.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.135
You think he's Bob Beamon and
I think he's, what, Ben Johnson?

27:12.136 --> 27:15.375
I mean, admittedly an athlete does
come along once in a while

27:15.376 --> 27:18.015
who breaks the world record
by a mile.

27:18.016 --> 27:20.735
And sometimes he's genuinely
superhuman but I will lay you odds

27:20.736 --> 27:24.576
all day long that more often
than not, that guy is a cheat.

27:28.136 --> 27:30.215
Sir...

27:30.216 --> 27:33.496
DCI Gates appears to be
an exemplary officer.

27:34.536 --> 27:36.575
Appears to be.

27:36.576 --> 27:38.216
My point exactly.

27:53.016 --> 27:54.856
Sorry.

27:57.896 --> 27:59.655
Hit-and-run?

27:59.656 --> 28:02.215
Why us?

28:02.216 --> 28:06.296
Because we've got a big sign
over our heads saying,
"CID, dump your crap here"?

28:09.176 --> 28:13.255
We've got ten unsolved burglaries
stinking up our figures.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.656
Give the hit-and-run to the civvy.

28:17.496 --> 28:21.135
She's had the training.
Anyway, I'm out of here.

28:21.136 --> 28:24.535
Gates' has been given
a written warning

28:24.536 --> 28:26.896
about his team's gender balance.
I'm a shoe-in.

29:06.936 --> 29:11.016
If you would just like to take
a seat, please, Ms Laverty.

29:28.096 --> 29:30.855
There we are. Sorry about that.

29:30.856 --> 29:36.175
You are Jacqueline Laverty, date of
birth 23rd of November 1967?

29:36.176 --> 29:37.575
Yeah.

29:37.576 --> 29:41.376
Right person. That's a good start.

29:43.096 --> 29:45.495
We don't have your occupation listed.

29:45.496 --> 29:48.055
I run my own business.

29:48.056 --> 29:52.256
Laverty Holdings. You could just
put down "self-employed".

30:00.576 --> 30:03.455
I'm sorry,
are you one of the detectives

30:03.456 --> 30:05.375
looking into the theft of my car?

30:05.376 --> 30:09.096
I carry out some forms of police work
but I'm not a police officer.

30:11.176 --> 30:12.775
Cut-backs.

30:12.776 --> 30:15.935
You reported your car stolen
at 10.06pm,

30:15.936 --> 30:18.936
the night before it was found
abandoned?

30:23.216 --> 30:27.935
I got back from a business
trip around 9.00

30:27.936 --> 30:31.616
and I later remembered I'd left
something in the car.

30:36.016 --> 30:37.655
When I went to get the keys,

30:37.656 --> 30:42.576
they were gone and they'd broken
part of the window in my front door.

30:43.736 --> 30:47.135
They hooked the keys from
the hall table.

30:47.136 --> 30:49.775
You didn't hear anything?

30:49.776 --> 30:52.376
I was in a back room,
with music playing.

31:08.176 --> 31:09.855
What the hell are you playing at?

31:09.856 --> 31:13.615
The woman seemed so convinced.
She made it impossible to
change the story.

31:13.616 --> 31:15.375
You don't change, do you?

31:15.376 --> 31:17.336
You're just always looking after
number one.

31:17.337 --> 31:21.815
No, no, no, Tony, no. I'll fix this.

31:21.816 --> 31:25.815
I will. I'll find a way.
Yeah, like you did today?

31:25.816 --> 31:28.415
I'll take the blame.

31:28.416 --> 31:31.936
I'll go to prison
if that's what you want.

31:35.456 --> 31:38.856
Not so bad. This'll cheer you up.

31:40.376 --> 31:43.055
Maybe this wasn't the best place
to come.

31:43.056 --> 31:45.975
Not at all, not at all. Young
fellow like yourself. New in town.

31:45.976 --> 31:48.495
You get yourself a girlfriend, eh?

31:48.496 --> 31:50.975
Hm.

31:50.976 --> 31:55.935
I haven't put my big
un-PC foot in it, have I?

31:55.936 --> 31:58.336
No, no, I'm straight.

31:59.976 --> 32:02.056
Two pints of larger, please.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.135
Hiya.

32:12.136 --> 32:14.495
Good evening. Daddy! Daddy!

32:14.496 --> 32:17.495
Whoa! Hey! Wow!
That's a great welcome.

32:17.496 --> 32:20.855
I got an A in piano today.
Do you want to hear?

32:20.856 --> 32:24.576
Sweetheart, Dad's just walked
in the door.

32:28.136 --> 32:30.376
Hi. I really don't mind.

32:38.336 --> 32:40.456
Kate.

32:41.576 --> 32:45.775
DS Arnott. Even in AC we have
first names. Steve.

32:45.776 --> 32:47.615
Right.

32:47.616 --> 32:50.055
We seem to have got off
on the wrong foot.

32:50.056 --> 32:56.135
Oh, maybe we should get to know
each other better, then, over
a pizza and a glass of Rioja. Sorry.

32:56.136 --> 33:00.175
Look... Tony Gates is
the best detective in this city.

33:00.176 --> 33:03.415
He saved a mum from being mugged at
knifepoint and you lot have stuck him

33:03.416 --> 33:07.055
for forgetting to fill in
the right bloody form.

33:07.056 --> 33:11.056
I mean, maybe there's more to you but
so far that's all I've seen.

34:23.775 --> 34:25.335
Good morning, sir.

34:30.536 --> 34:33.415
Sir, wait. Sir, listen.

34:33.416 --> 34:37.295
I can have a harassment charge
thrown down just like that, son.

34:37.295 --> 34:40.495
A minute of your time. Please.
Some of us have proper work to do.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.416
Look, I can't believe
you're stuck on for this.

34:44.536 --> 34:47.295
Hastings gives a toss about you
having a free egg and bacon.

34:47.295 --> 34:50.175
I don't. I just want to make
the yellow notice go away

34:50.176 --> 34:52.656
so we can both get on with
investigating real crime.

34:52.657 --> 34:55.895
Hastings has got you playing
mind games, son.

34:55.896 --> 34:59.695
A few weeks ago I was running
counter-terror ops.

34:59.696 --> 35:02.615
I'm a proper copper
and I know another when I see one.

35:02.616 --> 35:04.975
And you think you can
make Hastings back off?

35:04.976 --> 35:07.896
I can certainly try, sir.
Off the record.

35:08.976 --> 35:12.376
Well, that won't be easy, mate,
cos the man's a zealot.

35:13.616 --> 35:15.616
Don't I bloody know it!

35:16.976 --> 35:19.576
Why didn't you
log the gratuity, sir?

35:21.736 --> 35:22.856
I forgot.

35:24.016 --> 35:26.175
Yeah, I know it was a crap excuse.

35:26.176 --> 35:27.536
But it's the truth.

35:36.456 --> 35:39.216
Rita, isn't it? Sir?

35:43.056 --> 35:44.815
I'm DCI Gates.

35:44.816 --> 35:46.215
I know who you are, sir!

35:46.216 --> 35:48.616
There's, erm, a hit and run,
Rita... Oh, yes, sir.

35:48.617 --> 35:52.735
I'm still trying to match the victim
to the missing persons report.

35:52.736 --> 35:55.495
Well, it might connect to something
that my team are looking into.

35:55.496 --> 35:58.095
So if you get anywhere, you'll come
straight to me, won't you?

35:58.096 --> 35:59.575
No-one else?

35:59.576 --> 36:02.136
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely.
You're a star, Rita.

36:14.616 --> 36:16.615
Come in.

36:16.616 --> 36:19.815
Sorry to bother you, sir.

36:19.816 --> 36:21.415
Not a problem.

36:21.416 --> 36:25.415
I thought you should know I've been
looking back over the arrest reports

36:25.416 --> 36:27.375
over the last couple of days.

36:27.376 --> 36:30.175
I've noticed an upsurge
in Class A detections on the Bog.

36:30.176 --> 36:33.375
Thanks for the tip.
It's Fleming, isn't it?

36:33.376 --> 36:35.655
Yeah.

36:35.656 --> 36:37.096
It's good work.

36:39.496 --> 36:42.055
I want to join TO-20 sir.

36:42.056 --> 36:45.255
Anyone with any sense
would steer clear right now.

36:45.256 --> 36:48.096
AC-12? You'll piss
all over them, sir.

36:56.336 --> 36:57.855
I'm sick of CID, sir.

36:57.856 --> 37:00.695
We get all the crap that no-one
else wants. I'm better than that.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.335
I want to be on the squad.

37:02.336 --> 37:05.175
Join the queue. Well, check out
my CV. I've got five years.

37:05.176 --> 37:08.375
I've been kicked, punched,
spat on, pissed on...

37:08.376 --> 37:10.536
but, my social life aside...

37:13.336 --> 37:15.935
Every week it's a new initiative
or a new audit.

37:15.936 --> 37:18.575
I want to work for a unit that
actually fights crime.

37:18.576 --> 37:21.495
The big part of the job
description is surveillance.

37:21.496 --> 37:22.576
Yeah.

37:23.776 --> 37:25.535
Well, men are gonna notice you.

37:25.536 --> 37:28.176
What, and women don't notice you?

37:32.056 --> 37:34.495
Come for a drink this week.

37:34.496 --> 37:35.736
It's not a date.

37:35.737 --> 37:37.735
You're breaking my heart, sir.

37:37.736 --> 37:41.415
It'll just be a good way for you to
get to know the lads a bit. And...?

37:41.416 --> 37:42.496
And then we'll see.

37:43.936 --> 37:46.856
Yeah. OK, thanks.

37:52.656 --> 37:54.455
What the bloody hell was that?

37:54.456 --> 37:55.895
Nothing.

37:55.896 --> 38:00.015
I'm next in line for a squad.
Yeah, if you say so, Leah.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.816
I'm one-quarter Romany.

38:09.536 --> 38:11.216
Steve.

38:12.656 --> 38:17.095
The very man. So what can you
tell me about Tony Gates?

38:17.096 --> 38:19.135
Uh...

38:19.136 --> 38:22.415
Er, nothing? Oh, come on, Steve.
What can I say?

38:22.416 --> 38:24.135
I'm disappointed.

38:24.136 --> 38:26.695
Sir, I'm committed to
Anticorruption 100%...

38:26.696 --> 38:29.495
That's what I need to know, son.
Come on.

38:29.496 --> 38:32.295
One of our team has made
a breakthrough.

38:32.296 --> 38:34.096
What's going on, sir?

38:35.456 --> 38:38.815
All will be revealed, Steve,
all will be revealed.

38:38.816 --> 38:43.135
Alice, what a pleasant surprise.
I'll have to be on my toes today.

38:43.136 --> 38:46.375
You've always been
a lovely mover, sir.

38:46.376 --> 38:48.415
Tony, make yourself at home.

38:48.416 --> 38:52.696
I was surprised to be called back so
quickly, sir. I hope it's good news.

39:01.136 --> 39:03.935
AC-12 interview with
DCI Gates,

39:03.936 --> 39:07.375
Police Federation representation
DCI Alice Prior.

39:07.376 --> 39:10.735
I've been authorised to notify you
that we have grounds to widen

39:10.736 --> 39:14.175
our investigation into DCI Gates'
performance of professional duties.

39:14.176 --> 39:16.615
Widen the investigation? What?

39:16.616 --> 39:19.335
We have grounds under Professional
Duties and General Conduct.

39:19.336 --> 39:22.815
Specifically
in the practice of laddering.

39:22.816 --> 39:25.775
Which is the amplification, indeed,
the multiplication of charges

39:25.776 --> 39:28.176
against an offender...
I know what laddering is, sir.

39:28.177 --> 39:31.895
That's right, Tony.
You do. Here's the yellow notice.

39:31.896 --> 39:34.015
You've got the regulation ten days.

39:34.016 --> 39:36.575
DCI Gates strenuously denies
any wrongdoing.

39:36.576 --> 39:39.415
Nevertheless he offers the
investigation his full cooperation.

39:39.416 --> 39:43.775
Thank you. That's much appreciated.
I'd like to determine the conditions
of Tony's suspension.

39:43.776 --> 39:46.335
Oh, no, we're not asking for
a suspension at this time.

39:46.336 --> 39:49.375
We don't think he's a threat
to his fellow officers or indeed

39:49.376 --> 39:50.855
the public in general.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.535
Now, why should the citizens of this
country be denied

39:53.536 --> 39:56.375
his selfless service?

39:56.376 --> 39:58.055
Interview terminated.

39:58.056 --> 39:59.976
That's very generous of you, sir.

40:05.536 --> 40:08.535
Looks like you've
found your level, Arnott.

40:08.536 --> 40:11.416
Tony, let's not descend to...
Nobody plays me.

40:12.616 --> 40:15.096
Sir.

40:25.216 --> 40:28.055
You never detected the laddering
because you didn't even look.

40:28.056 --> 40:31.495
I recruited you because you took a
moral stand against your colleagues,

40:31.496 --> 40:33.215
despite the personal cost.

40:33.216 --> 40:36.015
You're a born AC-12 officer.
Why don't you start acting like one?

40:36.016 --> 40:39.295
You've dropped me
into an ongoing investigation.

40:39.296 --> 40:42.655
Now, you could test me
or you could actually brief me.

40:42.656 --> 40:46.495
OK. Tony Gates cherry-picks
the crimes that are easy to solve,

40:46.496 --> 40:47.895
then he dumps the rest.

40:47.896 --> 40:50.176
Then he invents a whole series
of additional charges

40:50.177 --> 40:53.855
that never make it to the courtroom
but boost his clean-up rates.

40:53.856 --> 40:58.455
Laddering. That's how Tony Gates
got where he is. No. He had to be
twice as good to get to there.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.495
What? So what are you saying? To be
corrupt he's got to be twice as bad?

41:01.496 --> 41:04.535
No, sir, victimisation
of a black officer...

41:04.536 --> 41:06.135
Oh, now, hang on a second.

41:06.136 --> 41:08.855
Don't you talk to me about
victimisation. What are you saying?

41:08.856 --> 41:10.895
Let me tell you something, son.

41:10.896 --> 41:14.375
Me and my best mate, we went through
basic training together, OK.

41:14.376 --> 41:18.535
First year out, they sent us on this
particular job.
The two Catholics, are you with me?

41:18.536 --> 41:22.855
We go straight over a pipe bomb.
I end up in intensive care,
him they bury.

41:22.856 --> 41:25.255
The Log Book goes missing,
nobody says a word.

41:25.256 --> 41:28.135
Don't you talk to me
about victimisation.

41:28.136 --> 41:30.376
Nobody's blacker than me, son!

41:39.096 --> 41:41.576
Kate! Hi, all right?

41:43.416 --> 41:46.975
Like the look of the recruitment
policy. Hey, nothing sexist.

41:46.976 --> 41:49.455
Oh? I'm off, then, good night.

41:49.456 --> 41:52.695
It's just HR will be down on me
like a ton of bricks.

41:52.696 --> 41:55.336
Big appointment for me, boys.
Yeah.

41:56.776 --> 41:57.895
Kate. Hi.

41:57.896 --> 41:59.975
DC Morton. Nige.
Yeah, all right?

41:59.976 --> 42:01.695
DS Matt Cottan. All right.

42:01.696 --> 42:04.096
Hi. Dot... Dot. Oh, OK.

42:05.096 --> 42:07.496
So Tone says you want to be
in with the in-crowd.

42:07.497 --> 42:10.415
The in-crowd? Where?

42:10.416 --> 42:12.216
Very good.

42:13.256 --> 42:17.375
I just want to work for the best,
sir. Oh, we're off duty now, Kate.
You can call me...

42:17.376 --> 42:19.376
Tina. Call him Tina.

42:21.296 --> 42:24.855
And last... And definitely least...
You met Deepak. Yep.

42:24.856 --> 42:26.535
I'm sorry, Kate, I didn't know

42:26.536 --> 42:30.095
whether you wanted a half or a pint,
so I just got you two halves.

42:30.096 --> 42:33.335
When you send a boy to do
a man's job. This is it.

42:33.336 --> 42:34.616
Thanks, Deepak.

42:34.617 --> 42:36.255
You're welcome.

42:36.256 --> 42:39.375
Oh, and I've got something
for you here, boss, as well.

42:39.376 --> 42:41.456
There you go! How about that?

42:43.776 --> 42:46.815
- Now, that is stuck on! Drink to that.
- Cheers!

42:46.816 --> 42:48.496
Thanks.

42:54.336 --> 42:55.776
Come with me.

43:07.536 --> 43:11.215
We're gonna get Gates
with or without you, Steve.

43:11.216 --> 43:12.855
So you can either help us,

43:12.856 --> 43:15.616
or be just another prick
who lost his bottle.

43:22.056 --> 43:23.936
It's your choice, son.

43:34.896 --> 43:38.615
I didn't know AC-12 used
undercover officers.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.216
Hence the term.

43:41.456 --> 43:45.935
You're the one that gave us
the information about the laddering.

43:45.936 --> 43:48.455
I'm on the inside at last, Steve.

43:48.456 --> 43:51.855
All this just to bring down Gates?

43:51.856 --> 43:55.495
Instead of spending all this
time and money policing the police,

43:55.496 --> 43:58.655
it'd make more sense to assign us
to cases that aren't being
investigated.

43:58.656 --> 44:02.015
TO-20's been nicknamed
the Big Sexy Crime Unit.

44:02.016 --> 44:06.695
Gates has been awarded the highest
budget three years running. His squad
has the best kit in the station.

44:06.696 --> 44:10.935
Meanwhile victims of crime miss out
on justice because he only tackles
cases that score points.

44:10.936 --> 44:12.895
Who doesn't? It's the system.

44:12.896 --> 44:17.215
I wouldn't be risking what
I'm risking if I didn't believe Gates
was a special case.

44:17.216 --> 44:20.095
I thought Anticorruption was about
getting blokes on the take,

44:20.096 --> 44:22.975
the ones in the pockets of
the criminals.

44:22.976 --> 44:25.295
You took a stand
and it put you out on your own.

44:25.296 --> 44:27.575
You're not on your own any more.

44:27.576 --> 44:29.456
Unless you want to be.

45:11.896 --> 45:15.135
Kate's been tracking arrests
on the Bog.

45:15.136 --> 45:18.135
Over the last month there's
been a three-fold increase

45:18.136 --> 45:20.535
in the supply and demand
of Class A narcotics.

45:20.536 --> 45:22.655
I've talked to the Fifth Floor.

45:22.656 --> 45:25.455
We've been given the go-ahead
for a surveillance op. We start...

45:25.456 --> 45:28.415
DCI Gates. DS Arnott,
can I help you?

45:28.416 --> 45:31.855
My car... That your doing?

45:31.856 --> 45:33.136
You shat on the boss.

45:33.137 --> 45:37.096
Yeah. Maybe someone just
returned the compliment.

45:39.976 --> 45:42.295
I want to talk to you alone. Now.

45:42.296 --> 45:44.176
Fire away.

45:51.536 --> 45:56.375
I thought maybe you were clean.
Looks like you're dirty, after all.

45:56.376 --> 46:00.616
You take a shot at the king,
make sure you kill him, son.

46:19.016 --> 46:22.175
"Fire away." That's priceless, boss.

46:22.176 --> 46:24.215
That's MasterCard.

46:24.216 --> 46:27.576
Which one of you muppets did it?

46:31.696 --> 46:33.655
I'm Spartacus.

46:33.656 --> 46:34.936
No, I'm Spartacus.

47:13.536 --> 47:17.695
Our old friend Wesley Duke,
with a big fat rucksack
full of crack cocaine.

47:17.696 --> 47:21.735
Now, when you was all tucked up
in your warm beds last night...

47:21.736 --> 47:23.535
You were tucked up with Dot.

47:23.536 --> 47:26.015
He's only jealous.

47:26.016 --> 47:30.015
Dot and me traced the source to
this address in Greek Lane.

47:30.016 --> 47:33.815
Now, Wesley's been small-time,
but this appears to be a new,

47:33.816 --> 47:37.015
large-scale supply he's tapped into.

47:37.016 --> 47:40.015
Next stage would be
to pick Wesley up and turn him.

47:40.016 --> 47:45.535
And what if he blabs?
We don't want to alert the Greek Lane
mob that we're watching them.

47:45.536 --> 47:49.375
That's a good point. Let's keep up
the surveillance for now, Nige.

47:49.376 --> 47:53.175
See who else comes and goes
from this address. Well done, matey.

47:53.176 --> 47:54.776
Erm, let it roll.

48:00.056 --> 48:01.935
Fleming. Yeah?

48:01.936 --> 48:06.256
I'm going to talk to the
Fifth Floor, get them to formally
approve your transfer to TO-20.

48:07.256 --> 48:09.696
Thanks, sir. I won't let you down.

49:18.176 --> 49:20.056
Any news?

49:21.976 --> 49:23.936
No, nothing.

49:25.776 --> 49:28.375
They're not suspicious?

49:28.376 --> 49:30.935
It's been filed as an unexplained
hit-and-run.

49:30.936 --> 49:33.296
That's good, isn't it?

49:37.296 --> 49:39.935
I shouldn't... I shouldn't be here.

49:39.936 --> 49:42.496
But you are.

50:54.656 --> 50:57.455
I have it on good authority that it
was Gates, himself,

50:57.456 --> 50:58.816
who soiled your car.

51:10.616 --> 51:13.695
Deepak...

51:13.696 --> 51:16.536
OK... Cheers, mate.

51:17.976 --> 51:19.655
Next turn's on the way, Dot.

51:19.656 --> 51:21.855
They're pulling us off
for the night.

51:21.856 --> 51:23.335
Pulling us off?

51:23.336 --> 51:27.335
Ah, best thing I got at
Hillside Lane was a pint after work.

51:27.336 --> 51:29.655
Right, come on.

51:29.656 --> 51:32.375
Shall we wait for the next turn
at least?

51:32.376 --> 51:34.816
Come on, you've had
the memo about overtime, Deepak.

51:34.817 --> 51:37.296
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Make a move.

51:56.496 --> 51:59.575
Excuse me, please. Thank you.

51:59.576 --> 52:01.295
Morning, sir.

52:01.296 --> 52:04.015
Let's get the pond life moved
much further away

52:04.016 --> 52:06.935
and they'll soon go back to
watching Jeremy Kyle. Yes, sir.

52:06.936 --> 52:09.095
See all these kids, get them
back in school,

52:09.096 --> 52:10.776
unless they're being excluded.

52:11.856 --> 52:14.416
Can you move back, please.

52:27.656 --> 52:29.015
Christ's sake, Dot.

52:29.016 --> 52:30.895
How many times, mate?

52:30.896 --> 52:34.295
It was ten minutes, 15 tops
before the next turn clocked on.

52:34.296 --> 52:36.776
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't in this job.

52:43.816 --> 52:45.016
Morning, boss.

52:52.976 --> 52:55.335
Tone, I don't know what to say,
mate...

52:55.336 --> 52:57.776
Later, Dot, all right?

52:58.816 --> 53:02.575
From the blood spatter,
both men were alive
when the fingers were amputated.

53:02.576 --> 53:05.335
Looks like whoever killed them
wanted to know something

53:05.336 --> 53:06.735
and didn't find out.

53:06.736 --> 53:09.215
The finger amputations are clean.

53:09.216 --> 53:13.095
Each one done with a single stroke.
Most likely...

53:13.096 --> 53:14.776
bolt-cutter.

53:15.936 --> 53:18.935
Dot, I want you to go through
the files back at the station,

53:18.936 --> 53:20.575
see if there's a similar MO here

53:20.576 --> 53:23.295
or at any other force's
case history. Right, OK.

53:23.296 --> 53:26.975
Nigel, I want entry control
front and back, all the dabs
in the downstairs rooms

53:26.976 --> 53:30.215
and, if there's
a bathroom upstairs, there too.

53:30.216 --> 53:32.535
And when forensics have got
all their samples,

53:32.536 --> 53:35.135
I want you to go through everything.

53:35.136 --> 53:37.975
Let's find out who these two boys
were, please.

53:37.976 --> 53:39.735
Aye-aye, skipper.

53:39.736 --> 53:42.096
Fleming, you do the door-to-door.

53:49.736 --> 53:52.455
You see what
I've bloody got to deal with.

53:52.456 --> 53:56.015
We're trying to get a job done here
and some pen pusher bans overtime.

53:56.016 --> 53:58.775
There were 15 minutes for someone
to break in.

53:58.776 --> 54:01.375
The lads in there are
the new kids on the block.

54:01.376 --> 54:04.375
And someone doesn't want them
muscling in on their territory.

54:04.376 --> 54:06.935
You not tempted to dump this one
on CID, sir?

54:06.936 --> 54:09.455
No chance. It's big.

54:09.456 --> 54:12.056
It's sexy. And that makes it mine.

54:38.536 --> 54:40.416
What goes around comes around.

54:46.176 --> 54:48.055
Mr Butterfield, I'm so sorry.

54:48.056 --> 54:50.656
Yeah. This time I was home
when they broke in.

54:52.776 --> 54:54.576
Just give me a minute.

54:57.016 --> 54:58.935
He's going to make a complaint!

54:58.936 --> 55:02.615
Sir, with respect, you told me
to put the case on the back-burner.

55:02.616 --> 55:04.176
I told you to prioritise.

55:15.936 --> 55:20.975
This missing persons report
came through from County CID.

55:20.976 --> 55:27.615
Mr Gurjit Patel. Reported missing
the day after the hit and run.

55:27.616 --> 55:33.975
Mr Patel was an accountant
for Laverty Holdings.

55:33.976 --> 55:38.695
Laverty Holdings is owned
by Jacqueline Laverty,

55:38.696 --> 55:43.176
the woman whose vehicle was
reported stolen.

55:44.216 --> 55:46.855
He was her accountant when...
Thank you, Rita.

55:46.856 --> 55:50.655
My squad is going to be taking over
this case from now on.

55:50.656 --> 55:54.015
And you can leave it to me to tell
County that we've got an ID.

55:54.016 --> 55:56.695
This is a very sensitive case, Rita,

55:56.696 --> 55:59.575
so I'm going to need to shoot
those files over to my computer.

55:59.576 --> 56:00.935
May I?

56:00.936 --> 56:02.456
Yes, sir... of course.

56:04.456 --> 56:06.256
Thank you.

56:08.936 --> 56:12.095
Erm, milk, no sugar would be nice.

56:12.096 --> 56:14.095
Yes, right.

56:14.096 --> 56:16.136
You're a star.
