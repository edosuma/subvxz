- Just give it to me whenever.

08:03.064 --> 08:05.225
I should go. I have to take
my cat to swim lessons.

08:05.306 --> 08:07.627
Bye.

08:07.707 --> 08:10.068
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

08:10.148 --> 08:12.790
- What are we going to do?
I don't even have $18 in here.

08:12.870 --> 08:14.191
I just have a $5
and some Altoids.

08:14.271 --> 08:15.592
- $1,800?
[door closes]

08:15.672 --> 08:17.153
That's, like,
the whole baby jar.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.034
I mean, we wouldn't even have
a baby jar.

08:19.114 --> 08:20.395
We would have a vase as a baby.
I don't want a ceramic baby!

08:20.475 --> 08:22.036
- Where do these rich moms
get off,

08:22.116 --> 08:24.157
charging so much for a hobby?

08:24.237 --> 08:26.038
- We cannot pay $1,800
for a vase, okay?

08:26.118 --> 08:27.399
We have to return it.

08:27.479 --> 08:29.080
- Oh, he's coming.
Here, hide it.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.801

There's no room
in any of these.

Take it, take it, take it.

08:35.524 --> 08:37.525
Don't throw it.
- Come on, come on.

08:40.447 --> 08:41.847
- Can I get in there?

08:41.927 --> 08:43.488
Game's on.
I wanted to grab some chips.

08:43.568 --> 08:45.129
- I ate them--all the chips.
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.209 --> 08:46.690
- They're gone, sorry.

08:46.770 --> 08:49.292
- Oh. Well, I'll just get
some pretzels.

08:49.372 --> 08:51.293
- Those are gone, too.
I ate 'em.

08:51.373 --> 08:53.094
It's my fault. With my beer--

08:53.174 --> 08:55.095
I needed them with my beer,
which is also gone.

08:55.175 --> 08:56.256

09:03.701 --> 09:05.021
- Power Crunch bars?
- We ate all of it.

09:05.101 --> 09:06.942
We ate all of it, all of it.

- Beef jerky? Teriyaki jerky?
Buffalo jerky? Turkey jerky?

09:09.264 --> 09:10.945
- It's gone. It's gone, yeah.
- Yeah, all the jerky.

09:11.025 --> 09:12.986
- So there's nothing
in the kitchen for me to eat?

09:13.066 --> 09:14.987
- Altoid?

09:15.067 --> 09:17.069
- Okay.

09:18.429 --> 09:20.270
- [exhales deeply]
- We pulled that off.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.951

09:37.041 --> 09:39.482
- Mom, Dad,
what are you doing here?

09:39.562 --> 09:40.803
- When Tom and Sarah told us

09:40.883 --> 09:42.364
the whole family
was staying over,

09:42.444 --> 09:43.965
we thought it would be fun
to swing by.

09:44.045 --> 09:45.926
Didn't they tell you?
- Why tell me?

09:46.006 --> 09:47.407
It's just my house.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.128
Why do you have a suitcase?

09:49.208 --> 09:50.689
- Oh, we thought it'd be
more fun to stay the night.

09:50.769 --> 09:52.370
Everybody else is.
- Mm.

09:52.450 --> 09:54.571
- Also, we were halfway
through watching "Pam & Tommy,"

09:54.651 --> 09:56.652
and our free Hulu trial
expired.

09:56.732 --> 09:58.613
- [sighs]
How about this?

09:58.694 --> 10:02.736
I will get you guys a new Hulu
subscription at your house.

10:02.816 --> 10:04.617
- Oh, I don't know.
This just seems easier.

10:04.697 --> 10:06.218
- Mm.
- I'll tell you what--

10:06.298 --> 10:07.819
I'll just park the bag
in the guest room,

10:07.899 --> 10:10.341

our binge on, huh?

10:10.421 --> 10:11.981
Oh, and you're welcome
to join us,

10:12.062 --> 10:14.023
but I got to warn you--
it's a little blue.

10:14.103 --> 10:16.184

No, I think I'll just, uh, go
for a drive.

- Oh, hey, uh, Con, I think
I may have blocked you in.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.509

such a big deal

10:30.833 --> 10:32.194

intimacy problem.

a problem.

10:33.835 --> 10:35.756
We've just been busy.
- So busy.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.597
- I mean, it's not
like we can't--you know.

10:38.677 --> 10:40.679
- We can totally "you know."

10:40.759 --> 10:42.840
- We could "you know" anytime.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.161
- Anytime.

right now.

your house and your money.

First, I thought I was busy.

15:14.443 --> 15:16.124

and then two months,

and now I'm just--
I'm in my head.

"Is it a problem?"

I was like, "Is it problem

15:21.567 --> 15:23.328

it's a problem?"

so weird and--and awkward

and--and weird.

15:28.331 --> 15:30.212

out of it, you know?

to think about it

about it.

16:22.163 --> 16:24.165
Nothing at all.

16:24.245 --> 16:25.886
- It was supposed to be
a gift to say thank you,

16:25.966 --> 16:27.487
but then Shamiah's friend's mom
tricked us into buying

16:27.567 --> 16:28.847
a really expensive vase,
and then we broke it,

16:28.928 --> 16:30.368
and so now we don't have
any money,

16:30.448 --> 16:32.410
and we also don't have
a present for you.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.931
- Or that.
It was also that.

16:34.011 --> 16:35.812
- Wait, who, Zara?

16:35.892 --> 16:38.173
She was always bugging me
to buy one of these things.

16:38.253 --> 16:40.014
This is actually perfect.
Let me pay for it.

16:40.094 --> 16:42.175
- You want to buy your own gift
that's broken?

16:42.256 --> 16:44.857
- The real gift is the thought

16:44.937 --> 16:47.299
and the fact this mom will stop
bugging me about buying a vase.

16:47.379 --> 16:48.859
What do I owe her?

16:48.940 --> 16:50.460
- Uh, 18.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.101
- Thousand?

16:52.181 --> 16:53.662
That's kind of steep.

16:53.742 --> 16:55.023
- Hundred.

16:55.103 --> 16:57.705
- Oh, seriously?
That's kind of a steal.

16:57.785 --> 17:00.266
This worked out great.
Thanks.

17:00.346 --> 17:03.348
- [laughing] Wow.

17:03.428 --> 17:05.870
Oh, I'm so relieved.

17:05.950 --> 17:07.551
[sighs]

17:07.631 --> 17:09.432
Aren't you relieved?
Why don't you look relieved?

17:09.512 --> 17:11.073
- Lulu, we almost got
financially wiped out

17:11.153 --> 17:12.394
by a vase.

17:12.474 --> 17:14.275
- Well, yeah,
but it's over now.

17:14.355 --> 17:16.196
- No, it's not. There's always
going to be another vase.

17:16.276 --> 17:17.837
- Why would there be
another vase?

17:17.917 --> 17:19.398
Oh, it's a metaphor
for unexpected expenses.

17:19.478 --> 17:20.719
Sorry, go on.

17:20.799 --> 17:22.320
- We can't even
keep up as it is.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.201
It's going to be even harder
with a baby.

17:24.281 --> 17:26.482
- Yeah, we don't want Connor to
have to bail us out every time.

17:26.562 --> 17:28.283
- We don't just need money
to have a baby.

17:28.363 --> 17:30.004
We need money to raise it.

17:30.084 --> 17:31.565
- We need a bigger baby jar.

17:31.645 --> 17:33.967
- I thought we were so close.
- I know.

17:34.047 --> 17:36.408
Come here.

17:36.488 --> 17:39.650
Okay, so what we need to do
is just figure out a way

17:39.730 --> 17:41.251
to make a little more money.

17:41.331 --> 17:43.332
- I mean, the school is looking
for a new coach

17:43.412 --> 17:44.693
for the debate team.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.254
I am really good at arguing.

17:46.334 --> 17:48.175
- You're not that good
at arguing.

17:48.255 --> 17:50.416
- Excuse me, I am very good
at arguing.

17:50.496 --> 17:51.657
Okay, now I see
what you're doing.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.138
- [laughs]

17:53.218 --> 17:54.659
- So I tell this guy

17:54.739 --> 17:56.540
if he raises
our fire-insurance premium,

17:56.620 --> 17:58.301
I'm going to take our home,
auto, and term-life policies

17:58.381 --> 17:59.902
and go elsewhere.

17:59.982 --> 18:01.583
- I thought we didn't
have term life.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.184
- We don't.
I was just making it up.

18:03.264 --> 18:05.545
I was riffing.
It was like jazz.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.627
Anyway, saved us
$14 a month, so...

18:07.707 --> 18:09.868
- Honey, nice job.

18:09.948 --> 18:11.709
Oh, this is so boring,

18:11.789 --> 18:14.271
and I'm so relieved
to not be talking about sex.

18:14.351 --> 18:15.712
- Me too.
[chuckles]

18:15.792 --> 18:18.153
A weight
has been lifted, right?

18:18.233 --> 18:22.275
[chuckles]
[both sigh]

18:24.797 --> 18:27.118
- You know,
the new garbage bins

18:27.198 --> 18:29.400
are arriving on Wednesday.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.441
- Yeah, I hear they
have self-locking lids.

18:31.521 --> 18:34.483
- Mm-hmm.

18:34.563 --> 18:39.046
- And the water tank stopped...
making that noise.

18:41.127 --> 18:43.968
- Cool, I'll, uh--I'll...

18:44.049 --> 18:45.569
cancel the plumber.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.651
- Mm.

18:49.892 --> 18:51.933
Oh, I cleaned the A.C. filters.

18:52.013 --> 18:53.214
- Mm.
- Right.

18:53.294 --> 18:54.975
- ♪ Turn down the lights ♪

18:55.055 --> 18:57.817
♪ We gonna do it right,
I can do just what... ♪

18:57.897 --> 18:59.538
- Oh, look
who's staying together.

18:59.618 --> 19:02.740
- Oh, they're glowing.
[all swooning]

19:02.820 --> 19:04.421
- You look great.
- So glad I could help.

19:04.501 --> 19:05.822
- Get your freak on.

19:05.902 --> 19:07.262
- Okay, I don't know
which is worse--

19:07.343 --> 19:08.703
when they were all worried
we weren't

19:08.783 --> 19:10.304
or now that they're happy
we did.

19:10.384 --> 19:12.185
- We can never talk
to these people again.

19:12.265 --> 19:13.786
- Right.
- Hey, proud of you, bud.

19:13.866 --> 19:16.868
- Well, Tom, Marina,

19:16.948 --> 19:19.430
I'm happy my wine cellar
was good to you.

19:19.510 --> 19:23.432
And, Mom, Dad,
I am obviously thrilled

19:23.512 --> 19:24.953
that you finished
"Pam & Tommy."

19:25.033 --> 19:26.474
- Thank you.

19:26.554 --> 19:28.075
Did you know they were based
on real people?

19:28.155 --> 19:29.796
- That can't be right.
- Yeah.

19:29.876 --> 19:33.438
- But, unfortunately,
this endless brunch is over.

19:33.518 --> 19:35.239
It's time for everyone
to leave,

19:35.319 --> 19:36.600
except for Sarah and Denise.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.161
They actually don't have
anywhere to go.

19:38.241 --> 19:39.482
- Thank you so much.
- It was the vase.

19:39.562 --> 19:40.923
- Uh-huh.

19:41.003 --> 19:42.243
- Sorry, man,
we totally understand.

19:42.323 --> 19:44.485
- No, I can read
between the lines.

19:44.565 --> 19:47.447
- Mm, no lines,
just telling you to leave.

19:47.527 --> 19:49.768
- Connor, you were so nice
to let us all stay.

19:49.848 --> 19:51.929
I mean, we just all
descended on you like--

19:52.009 --> 19:54.091
- Locusts.
- Yes, thank you, Lupe.

19:54.171 --> 19:55.852
Felt like you had
that one ready.

19:55.932 --> 19:57.853
- Sweetie, giving you
your space back

19:57.933 --> 19:59.134
is the least we can do.

19:59.214 --> 20:01.095
Consider us gone.

20:01.175 --> 20:04.337
- Thanks, everyone.

20:04.417 --> 20:06.258
- All right, you know, just
take it away from me, please.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.019
[laughs]
- This is what you want.

20:08.099 --> 20:09.580
- Yes, thank you.
[laughs]

20:09.660 --> 20:11.421
- Any more waffles?

20:11.501 --> 20:13.862
- It would be weird to have
a croissant and a frittata.

20:13.942 --> 20:15.904
[laughter]

20:15.984 --> 20:17.505
- Tom.
- Oh, you mean now?

20:17.585 --> 20:19.586
Okay, yeah.

20:21.667 --> 20:25.669
[sports announcer
speaking indistinctly on TV]

20:25.750 --> 20:27.391
- Hey, Connor.

20:27.471 --> 20:30.232
Uh, we felt really bad
about messing up your gift.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.914
- So we got you this.
- It's a handmade coupon book.

20:33.994 --> 20:37.196
So each one is good for
one hour of total alone time.

20:37.276 --> 20:39.078
- Just give us one of those
anytime you want us

20:39.158 --> 20:40.719
out of your hair.

20:40.799 --> 20:44.040
- And we will give you all
the space that you need.

20:44.121 --> 20:45.762
Oh, you want to use
them all right now.

20:45.842 --> 20:47.122
- Let's go.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.563
- This is, like, 17 hours.

20:48.643 --> 20:50.644
- Guess you got
17 hours to fill.

20:52.566 --> 20:55.007

cheers and applause on TV]
