00:00.091 --> 00:03.359
I hit her on the head with a skillet.

00:03.359 --> 00:04.820
Ah! 
What am I do?

00:04.820 --> 00:07.365
Bernard Ferrion, you're under arrest
for the murder of Della Ferrion.

00:07.365 --> 00:09.584
They arrested you last week
for whacking your mother,

00:09.584 --> 00:11.307
you got off on a technicality,

00:11.307 --> 00:14.542
now the woman next door turns up
dead from a blow to the head.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.196
What could possibly make
them think of you?

00:16.196 --> 00:20.005
Now go away.
I do not represent evil people.

00:20.005 --> 00:23.282
The lawyer who got the T.R.O.
He says he's your son.

00:23.282 --> 00:25.113
–Donny Crane.
–Denny Crane.

00:25.113 --> 00:29.896
You gave me the Crane legacy,
and I fully plan on living up to it.

00:29.896 --> 00:32.310
–He's not my son.
–Obviously, he doesn't know.

00:32.310 --> 00:35.841
You're not my father?
I'm not your son?

00:35.841 --> 00:38.102
I'm not your son.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:48.506 --> 00:49.528
Tell me where he is!

00:49.528 --> 00:51.186
Tell me where he is,
or I'm gonna break your arm!

00:51.186 --> 00:53.406
Tell me, or I'm gonna
break your arm!

01:02.619 --> 01:04.629
ABC's latest reality show?

01:04.629 --> 01:07.065
That was taken by one
of the victim's family members.

01:07.065 --> 01:10.643
I see. Why go to his aid
when you can get the footage?

01:10.643 --> 01:12.487
Why am I here, Shirley?

01:12.487 --> 01:15.488
We represent the police union,
and accordingly, the officer.

01:15.488 --> 01:17.161
I need you to second chair
me at the trial.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.935
I can't do it.

01:18.935 --> 01:22.792
–You don't mean to say that.
–You're right. The word is “won't.”

01:22.792 --> 01:24.815
You have more experience
with criminal defense work.

01:24.815 --> 01:27.182
I like my clients to have
a modicum of humanity.

01:27.182 --> 01:30.051
Don't we all in the meantime.

01:30.051 --> 01:31.757
I'm not doing it, Shirley.

01:31.757 --> 01:35.648
That officer disgusts me.
I won't contribute to his freedom.

01:35.648 --> 01:38.840
I wasn't expecting you
to do it for him.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.238
Is that what you think, silly?

01:41.238 --> 01:46.719
See, I expect you to do it because 
this firm pays you $375,000 a year.

01:46.719 --> 01:49.155
That's a lot of money, Alan,
and we expect you to work for it,

01:49.155 --> 01:52.716
even when it requires doing things
that don't quite agree with you.

01:52.716 --> 01:58.022
I expect you to do it because 
a senior partner is, oh, no, check that,

01:58.022 --> 02:01.595
the senior partner
is asking you to do it.

02:01.595 --> 02:03.579
I expect you to do it because

02:03.579 --> 02:08.134
you so often refer to lawyers
as unprincipled soulless whores.

02:08.134 --> 02:12.156
Well, for the next few days,
I need you to be my whore.

02:12.156 --> 02:18.729
And if that so offends you,
I guess you could always quit.

02:18.729 --> 02:20.785
But I warn you,

02:20.785 --> 02:23.682
you will be missed…

02:23.720 --> 02:27.029
for at least all of five minutes.

02:33.727 --> 02:37.657
Boston Legal
1x15. Tortured Souls

03:01.926 --> 03:03.587
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2005/02/20

03:03.587 --> 03:05.299
Uh, where's Mr Crane?

03:05.299 --> 03:07.878
At 9:00 in the morning,
he could be many places.

03:07.878 --> 03:12.158
Why? –Well, will he be present
for the settlement conference?

03:12.158 --> 03:14.136
He should be.
But first let's…

03:14.136 --> 03:18.312
and if it doesn't settle,
will he be trying it?

03:20.494 --> 03:22.938
–Frannie, let's talk here.
–Okay.

03:22.938 --> 03:26.216
We're going to settle.
It must settle.

03:26.216 --> 03:28.498
Suing a man for being left
at the altar…

03:28.498 --> 03:30.478
in front of 300 people…

03:30.478 --> 03:32.960
courts don't like to get
involved in breakups.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.217
Not to discount your pain,
which I'm sure is real.

03:36.217 --> 03:39.911
We are looking at the very real possibility
of a directed verdict against us.

03:39.911 --> 03:45.012
In light of that, my recommendation
is that you accept the offer.

03:45.012 --> 03:48.153
Uh, for $175,000?

03:48.153 --> 03:49.599
Yes.

03:49.599 --> 03:51.189
Oh, no.

03:51.189 --> 03:54.240
Um, Denny Crane 
promised me more.

03:56.039 --> 03:59.132
How much did 
he promise you, Frannie?

03:59.583 --> 04:01.156
$5 million.

04:05.597 --> 04:06.998
Maybe I should quit.

04:06.998 --> 04:09.650
This woman has no idea
who or what I am.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.789
Lighten up, man.

04:10.789 --> 04:14.637
First of all, the idea of giving
representation to that thug…

04:14.637 --> 04:16.740
Alan, come on,
we hate all our clients.

04:16.740 --> 04:17.805
It's good to hate them.

04:17.805 --> 04:20.024
It allows us to overcharge
and still sleep at night.

04:20.024 --> 04:22.434
I thought her gamesmanship
would at least be more nuanced.

04:22.434 --> 04:26.179
Alan, I'm sorry for
becoming abrupt last night.

04:26.179 --> 04:30.124
The simple fact is, I need you.
It's a difficult case.

04:30.124 --> 04:32.010
Also, for what it's worth,

04:32.010 --> 04:35.931
I've been known to get contentious 
with men I unconsciously want to bed.

04:35.931 --> 04:38.373
I can't possibly imagine
wanting to have sex with you,

04:38.373 --> 04:40.613
but then again, I did
sleep with Denny.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.678
Uh, we should go.
The trial starts at 10:00.

04:47.753 --> 04:50.820
I will do this case.
Sit by her side.

04:50.820 --> 04:53.485
For no other reason
than to solve her.

04:54.518 --> 04:56.609
Alan, I'm sorry.

04:56.609 --> 04:59.171
The midget is back.

04:59.171 --> 05:02.281
–I beg your pardon?
–The little man, he's here.

05:02.281 --> 05:05.101
Alan. –Good gracious.
Who have you killed now?

05:05.101 --> 05:08.808
–That question is extremely hurtful.
–Why are you here, Bernard?

05:08.808 --> 05:12.575
Well, uh, I just dropped
by to say hello.

05:12.575 --> 05:14.549
I was in the neighborhood.

05:14.549 --> 05:17.525
How are you?

05:18.228 --> 05:21.704
Bernie, I'm due in court.
I don't have time to talk to you.

05:21.704 --> 05:23.504
State your business, if you
have any, with Catherine,

05:23.504 --> 05:25.450
and I'll call you back.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.640
Forgive me.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.936
I'm uncomfortable 
around little people.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.187
Let me ask you, Bernie,

05:39.187 --> 05:43.227
have you ever thought
about finding God?

05:43.227 --> 05:45.225
Can we talk a second?

05:51.306 --> 05:53.293
Lock and load.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.735
Where's the client?

05:59.735 --> 06:03.011
I sent her home.
She doesn't need to be here for this.

06:03.011 --> 06:04.159
Oh, for God's sake…

06:04.159 --> 06:08.958
Mr Crane, did you tell the client
we could get her $5 million?

06:08.958 --> 06:12.509
I might've. So? –The case 
values out in the low six figures.

06:12.509 --> 06:15.300
That's assuming it doesn't get tossed
out on public policy grounds.

06:15.300 --> 06:20.013
Listen, young lady, first rule
of thumb when practicing law,

06:20.013 --> 06:24.693
always, always promise the client
millions and millions of dollars.

06:24.693 --> 06:26.121
It's good business.

06:26.121 --> 06:30.229
And when it comes time to making
good on such a ridiculous claim…

06:30.229 --> 06:32.174
Donny Crane.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.472
Donny Crane.
You remember me.

06:36.472 --> 06:38.357
We used to be father and son.

06:38.357 --> 06:41.399
–Nice to see you.
–Where's Michael Gendler?

06:41.399 --> 06:44.362
I'm appearing as 
the defendant's new counsel.

06:44.362 --> 06:49.023
That $175,000, it's off the table.
By the by, way too high.

06:49.023 --> 06:51.258
We'll go to $50,000.

06:51.258 --> 06:53.309
Donny Crane.

06:53.309 --> 06:54.796
That's rejected.

06:54.796 --> 06:56.639
Whoa. 
No counter?

06:56.639 --> 06:58.323
$350,000.

06:58.323 --> 06:59.879
Double whoa.

06:59.879 --> 07:03.453
Well, guess that 
means a trial, huh?

07:03.453 --> 07:04.853
Cool.

07:04.853 --> 07:07.679
More experience for me.

07:07.806 --> 07:09.842
Donny Crane.

07:09.842 --> 07:12.203
–Denny Crane.
–Donny crane.

07:12.203 --> 07:14.735
You got on this case
specifically because I'm on it.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.026
–I did.
–You wanna get me?

07:16.026 --> 07:18.664
–I do.
–I love it.

07:18.664 --> 07:20.314
–Denny Crane.
–Donny Crane.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.037
–Denny Crane.
–Donny Crane.

07:22.037 --> 07:24.882
–Denny Crane.
–Donny Crane.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.918
We had received a tip that
the, uh, suspect Damon Harris

07:36.918 --> 07:40.611
was visiting his brother Paul,
so we went to the brother's house.

07:40.611 --> 07:43.164
–And did you find the suspect?
–Excuse me.

07:43.164 --> 07:46.018
I'm new to this case,
as is the jury, of course.

07:46.018 --> 07:47.666
To help us track the facts,

07:47.666 --> 07:51.593
I was wondering if you could refer
to him as the kidnapping suspect,

07:51.593 --> 07:56.349
so we're clear that we're talking about
the man who snatched a 6-year-old child.

07:56.349 --> 07:59.275
The boy is sitting right over here.

07:59.275 --> 08:01.808
Was the kidnapping 
suspect there, officer?

08:01.808 --> 08:03.139
No.

08:03.139 --> 08:05.040
–The brother was there?
–Yes.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.825
Could you tell us what happened?

08:06.825 --> 08:08.856
Well, we searched the premises.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.503
Couldn't find the 
kidnapping suspect.

08:11.503 --> 08:14.494
We asked the brother
if he knew his whereabouts.

08:14.494 --> 08:18.358
–He claimed he did not.
–And then what happened?

08:18.358 --> 08:21.142
What happened is basically
what you saw on the tape.

08:21.142 --> 08:26.283
My partner began to, uh, interrogate
the brother more coercively.

08:26.283 --> 08:28.488
At any time, 
was the victim of this attack

08:28.488 --> 08:31.149
considered a suspect 
himself in the kidnapping?

08:31.149 --> 08:31.971
No.

08:31.971 --> 08:34.722
You never considered him
connected to the crime?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.392
No.

08:36.392 --> 08:40.616
As Mr Shore noted, you were trying to
find the 6-year-old boy seated over here.

08:40.616 --> 08:44.383
Yes. –He was kidnapped 
how long before this incident?

08:44.383 --> 08:46.147
The day before.

08:46.147 --> 08:51.130
As time goes by, what are the chances
of finding a kidnapped child alive?

08:51.130 --> 08:55.408
After 48 hours,
we consider it extremely remote.

08:55.408 --> 08:57.699
In fact, the kidnapper 
we're talking about

08:57.699 --> 09:00.234
is suspected in the kidnapping
of another boy, correct?

09:00.234 --> 09:03.728
–Yes.
–Did you ever find that boy?

09:03.906 --> 09:06.785
We found his remains.

09:07.045 --> 09:11.141
While my client was committing
his coercive acts against the brother,

09:11.141 --> 09:13.971
what did you do?
–I stood back.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.217
You never intervened?

09:16.217 --> 09:17.802
No.

09:17.802 --> 09:19.595
Did you report it?

09:19.595 --> 09:22.873
Not at first, uh, eventually.

09:22.873 --> 09:26.988
By the way, as a result
of my client's physical coercive acts,

09:26.988 --> 09:28.375
did the brother tell you anything?

09:28.375 --> 09:30.837
He gave us a list of places
his brother would frequent.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.469
And did you search those places?

09:32.469 --> 09:33.863
Yes.

09:33.863 --> 09:35.289
And?

09:35.289 --> 09:37.559
We found the suspect.

09:38.367 --> 09:40.633
And the child.

09:45.378 --> 09:46.953
Thank you.

09:56.603 --> 09:58.664
All I'm saying is,

09:58.664 --> 10:03.347
if you killed two people
and if you're as alone as you say,

10:03.347 --> 10:08.690
there couldn't be a better time for you
to turn to Jesus Christ, your savior.

10:08.690 --> 10:11.862
Under normal circumstances, I'd agree.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.982
–But?
–I'm Jewish.

10:13.982 --> 10:18.413
Bernie, there has never ever
been a Jewish serial killer.

10:18.413 --> 10:20.758
Son of Sam. David Berkowitz.

10:20.758 --> 10:22.363
He was adopted.

10:22.363 --> 10:25.002
Genetically, he's one of ours.

10:25.002 --> 10:27.493
Well, what are you saying?

10:27.493 --> 10:30.950
I am saying that if you're
out there murdering people,

10:30.950 --> 10:34.574
on some level, you must want
to be christian.

10:34.574 --> 10:38.103
Would you let me 
take you to church?

10:44.542 --> 10:48.064
I've gotta admire your guts
to take a piece of the old man.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.422
There's a fire in the belly.

10:49.422 --> 10:53.289
Yeah, you're an old man.
Just not mine, remember?

10:53.469 --> 10:55.376
Yeah.

10:55.376 --> 10:58.322
The thing is…

10:58.492 --> 11:01.659
I like you. Actually…

11:05.505 --> 11:07.571
I love you.

11:07.571 --> 11:11.479
That's a difficult thing
for Denny Crane to say…

11:11.479 --> 11:15.871
unless it's part of foreplay.

11:16.131 --> 11:18.158
I love you, Donny,

11:18.158 --> 11:19.833
and I'm concerned that

11:19.833 --> 11:22.821
if you go up against me
in a court of law you'll…

11:22.821 --> 11:25.951
I might as well just 
come out and say it.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.494
I can't be beat.

11:28.494 --> 11:30.691
–Really.
–Never lost. Never will.

11:30.691 --> 11:34.530
–I beat you in the salmon case.
–You beat Brad Chase.

11:34.530 --> 11:37.646
–Me? undefeated.
–I see.

11:37.718 --> 11:41.421
Well, how do I put this?

11:41.421 --> 11:45.168
I took this case mainly
to kick your fat lying ass.

11:45.168 --> 11:46.745
I mean that in a good way.

11:46.745 --> 11:49.275
I will beat you.

11:49.406 --> 11:50.686
–No, you won't.
–Yes, I will.

11:50.686 --> 11:51.991
–Won't.
–I will.

11:51.991 --> 11:54.027
–Won't.
–Will.

11:54.027 --> 11:57.458
–Son.
–Don't call me that.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.952
I'm gonna say 
this one more time…

12:00.952 --> 12:04.868
with all the humility 
I can summon up.

12:04.868 --> 12:08.323
I'm the greatest trial attorney
that ever lived.

12:08.323 --> 12:11.151
You will not beat me.

12:21.534 --> 12:24.812
I don't know how 
much you just heard.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.554
My ass may lie…

12:29.554 --> 12:32.312
but it's all muscle.

12:44.127 --> 12:45.699
I knew he knew something.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.179
Either where his brother was
or where the child was.

12:47.179 --> 12:48.508
He knew something.

12:48.508 --> 12:51.008
And you were prepared
to beat it out of him.

12:51.008 --> 12:53.149
I was prepared to punch him,
to intimidate him.

12:53.149 --> 12:54.867
I didn't actually mean 
to break his arm.

12:54.867 --> 12:59.262
But, Mr Kirkland,
what we saw on that tape…

12:59.931 --> 13:03.434
there are different rules in kidnappings.
–What do you mean, “different rules”?

13:03.434 --> 13:07.026
The understanding is we're not supposed
to break bones or cause any permanent injury,

13:07.026 --> 13:09.016
but physical discomforture is permitted.

13:09.016 --> 13:12.746
It's okay to say, dislocate
a shoulder, tear a muscle.

13:12.746 --> 13:16.036
You're talking about torture.
This was an innocent man.

13:16.036 --> 13:18.499
He wasn't even the 
suspected kidnapper.

13:18.499 --> 13:20.435
And I'm sorry I hurt him,

13:20.435 --> 13:22.939
but I felt he knew 
where his brother was.

13:22.939 --> 13:26.498
I consider this to be like
self-defense or defense of others.

13:26.498 --> 13:29.795
I was gonna do whatever I could
to save that boy.

13:29.795 --> 13:32.651
All I could think about
was my own son.

13:32.651 --> 13:35.144
The end justifies the means?

13:35.144 --> 13:37.057
I guess I have to say yes to that.

13:37.057 --> 13:40.578
Suppose the suspected kidnapper
had confessed to a priest.

13:40.578 --> 13:43.639
You'd feel no compunction about beating
up clergy to get your information?

13:43.639 --> 13:45.816
–I didn't say that.
–Well, is there a distinction?

13:45.816 --> 13:49.779
An innocent man has information that
would lead to the recovery of a child.

13:49.779 --> 13:51.710
I guess I felt the victim here
wasn't so innocent.

13:51.710 --> 13:53.890
Ah, so you're out there 
playing judge, too?

13:53.890 --> 13:55.824
Policeman, judge, executioner…

13:55.824 --> 13:57.768
Objection. –Sustained.

13:57.768 --> 14:01.729
Who told you it was 
okay to tear muscles

14:01.729 --> 14:04.938
and dislocate shoulders
in kidnapping situations?

14:04.938 --> 14:07.113
There's no formal directive.
Just understood.

14:07.113 --> 14:11.058
Understood by the police who
arrested you after you did it?

14:11.058 --> 14:12.947
I was arrested because the media 
got a hold of this.

14:12.947 --> 14:14.896
That's the only reason I'm here.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.473
How sad is that?

14:16.473 --> 14:19.704
You tortured an innocent man
with no criminal record

14:19.704 --> 14:23.503
whose only offense was that his
fugitive brother stopped at his house,

14:23.503 --> 14:28.411
and the only reason you're here
is because the media got a hold of it.

14:33.657 --> 14:38.280
<i>Do you, Frannie, take Michael to 
be your lawfully wedded husband,</i>

14:38.280 --> 14:40.838
<i>for here and ever after?</i>

14:40.838 --> 14:42.970
<i>I do.</i>

14:43.270 --> 14:47.480
<i>And do you, Michael, take Frannie
to be your lawfully wedded wife,</i>

14:47.480 --> 14:50.751
<i>for here and ever after?</i>

14:52.359 --> 14:54.377
<i>Michael.</i>

14:55.114 --> 15:00.011
<i>Do you, Michael, take Frannie to
be your lawfully wedded wife,</i>

15:00.011 --> 15:02.966
<i>for here and ever after?</i>

15:05.140 --> 15:06.785
<i>Michael?</i>

15:08.943 --> 15:12.600
<i>I'm sorry. I can't.</i>

15:12.600 --> 15:15.381
<i>I just can't.</i>

15:26.831 --> 15:29.225
I waited my whole life for this day.

15:29.225 --> 15:31.812
My friends, my family…

15:31.812 --> 15:37.357
they were all gathered to celebrate
the happiest event in my life.

15:37.357 --> 15:42.927
And instead, they were witness
to such a humiliation.

15:42.927 --> 15:46.244
I'm still reeling from it psychologically.

15:46.244 --> 15:48.344
Did you require treatment?

15:48.344 --> 15:50.501
Yes. For many, many months.

15:50.501 --> 15:54.482
My therapist thinks the trauma is even
an inhibitor to my finding love again.

15:54.482 --> 15:59.790
Had he given any indication at all
that he was wavering?

15:59.790 --> 16:01.631
None. No.

16:01.631 --> 16:03.948
Everything was fine.

16:03.948 --> 16:07.511
Um, it was more than fine, actually.
It was perfect.

16:07.511 --> 16:12.057
Until suddenly, um…

16:12.057 --> 16:14.055
well, what you saw.

16:14.055 --> 16:18.189
I'm in the church with 300 people
gathered from all over.

16:18.189 --> 16:20.708
He just, um…

16:20.708 --> 16:23.128
well, you saw it.

16:23.128 --> 16:24.815
What are you saying?

16:24.815 --> 16:26.214
If he didn't feel committed,

16:26.214 --> 16:30.153
he should've married you just the same
because the catering was paid for?

16:30.153 --> 16:34.020
If he didn't feel committed,
what were we doing up there?

16:34.020 --> 16:37.772
I, I was standing in my gown,
my wedding dress.

16:37.772 --> 16:40.375
But this is love, Frannie.

16:40.375 --> 16:44.154
It takes funny unexpected bounces.

16:44.154 --> 16:46.135
We're talking about 
emotions of the heart.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.449
Objection.

16:47.449 --> 16:50.141
–Sounds like a girly man.
–Move to strike!

16:50.141 --> 16:53.580
–That's better.
–Mr Crane.

16:54.348 --> 16:58.411
Frannie. Do you think my client 
planned for it to go down like this?

16:58.411 --> 17:02.658
Do you have any idea
what a jolt it was?

17:02.658 --> 17:08.307
to be left standing in the church on a day
that you've been planning for a lifetime?

17:08.307 --> 17:11.896
You see that guy over there?
Denny Crane?

17:12.781 --> 17:15.965
He pretended to be 
my father for 25 years.

17:15.965 --> 17:17.852
–I know a good jolt when I…
–Objection!

17:17.852 --> 17:20.171
You lost a fiancé.
I lost a foundation.

17:20.171 --> 17:21.928
–Objection!
–Mr Crane.

17:21.928 --> 17:23.993
Emotional wallops are a part of life.

17:23.993 --> 17:25.579
You don't go running into court
to address them.

17:25.579 --> 17:26.971
That's exactly what
you're doing now.

17:26.971 --> 17:29.488
–You shut up!
–Counsel!

17:32.735 --> 17:35.716
I'm sorry.

17:35.716 --> 17:39.203
I apologize to the court.

17:39.203 --> 17:45.669
Sometimes pain can
cause you to lash out.

17:45.713 --> 17:48.352
Would you agree with that, Frannie?

17:48.352 --> 17:50.889
If the hurt was deep enough,

17:50.889 --> 17:55.077
you'd want to lash out at
the person who caused it?

17:55.077 --> 18:02.067
Is it possible you're doing
just a little of that here, hmm?

18:17.249 --> 18:21.896
That recovery was so smooth
it almost looked planned, but it wasn't.

18:21.896 --> 18:23.319
I gotcha.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.121
–You don't got me.
–I do.

18:25.121 --> 18:26.433
–No, you don't.
–Do.

18:26.433 --> 18:30.025
–Don't.
–Sir, you're opposing counsel.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.529
Unless you want to settle the case.

18:32.529 --> 18:35.512
That isn't the point, to settle a score.

18:35.512 --> 18:39.512
You caused me to believe you were
my father for my entire life.

18:39.512 --> 18:42.646
You think that score 
can be evened up?

18:56.997 --> 18:58.243
Rhina.

18:58.243 --> 18:59.674
Chelina.

18:59.674 --> 19:03.157
I've decided to take
the defendant's cross.

19:03.157 --> 19:05.925
Mr Crane, I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

19:05.925 --> 19:07.570
Well, whose idea is it?

19:07.570 --> 19:10.270
–Yours.
–Well, it must be good.

19:10.430 --> 19:12.966
Mr Crane, do you even know
what this case is about?

19:12.966 --> 19:14.984
It's about money.
They're always about money.

19:14.984 --> 19:18.648
I strongly suggest 
you let me handle this.

19:18.648 --> 19:20.907
How about…

19:21.431 --> 19:24.791
How about…

19:24.791 --> 19:27.311
How about those patriots?

19:33.028 --> 19:34.951
Never ever, ever,

19:34.951 --> 19:38.705
did we send the message,
directly, indirectly, or otherwise,

19:38.705 --> 19:43.465
that it is acceptable procedure to 
physically coerce suspects or witnesses.

19:43.465 --> 19:45.197
Officer Kirkland says 
it was understood

19:45.197 --> 19:47.925
that with kidnapping cases
there's a different set of rules.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.141
He's mistaken.

19:49.141 --> 19:51.521
Our department is to serve 
and protect the public,

19:51.521 --> 19:53.987
and that includes honoring
their civil liberties.

19:53.987 --> 19:58.348
So he was acting outside the scope of his
authority as a police officer, in your opinion.

19:58.348 --> 20:00.791
He was acting outside 
the scope of the law.

20:00.791 --> 20:03.205
He committed 
a vicious criminal assault.

20:03.205 --> 20:04.649
It was disgraceful.

20:04.649 --> 20:07.447
I'm repulsed every time
I see that footage.

20:07.447 --> 20:10.386
That's a funny thing that
you mention footage, captain,

20:10.386 --> 20:14.552
because my client wasn't arrested
until that video was aired on the news.

20:14.552 --> 20:16.919
We were investigating
prior to that broadcast.

20:16.919 --> 20:18.965
Ah. You were investigating.

20:18.965 --> 20:22.499
Tell me, when did you first hear
about my client's conduct?

20:22.499 --> 20:26.271
–I can't really recall.
–Maybe I can help out.

20:26.271 --> 20:31.220
The, uh, victim made a complaint
and filed a written report

20:31.220 --> 20:34.262
the day that it happened.
His family members verified it.

20:34.262 --> 20:38.819
You had knowledge of my client's disgraceful
acts from day one, didn't you, captain?

20:38.819 --> 20:41.296
And yet, when they 
recovered the child,

20:41.296 --> 20:44.223
you held a press conference
singing the praises of your officers,

20:44.223 --> 20:46.037
including Mr Kirkland.

20:46.037 --> 20:48.798
Then, when the footage went
out over the airwaves,

20:48.798 --> 20:52.223
suddenly my client's conduct
became disgraceful.

20:52.223 --> 20:56.637
We have not ever, and will
not ever, condone torture.

20:56.637 --> 20:59.865
Alan Dershowitz recently said
that if we had a suspect in custody

20:59.865 --> 21:02.291
who knew that a bomb was about
to go off and kill people,

21:02.291 --> 21:04.219
torture would be used.
Do you disagree with that?

21:04.219 --> 21:07.284
We've never had such a ticking
bomb case here, so I can't answer.

21:07.284 --> 21:10.830
Let's say we're trying
to crack a big terrorist case.

21:10.830 --> 21:14.077
Say, the Pan Am jet that 
went down in Lockerbie.

21:14.077 --> 21:17.367
–Was torture used there?
–You'd have to ask the FBI.

21:17.367 --> 21:21.933
There were reports, I should
say rumors about the Lockerbie case,

21:21.933 --> 21:25.024
that electrical devices were attached
to the prisoners' genitalia.

21:25.024 --> 21:26.448
–Are you familiar…
–Objection.

21:26.448 --> 21:30.298
This court is not going
to admit rumors, Ms Schmidt.

21:30.298 --> 21:32.573
Let me ask you something, captain.

21:32.573 --> 21:38.077
If they were tortured, do you care?

21:38.159 --> 21:40.610
I was surprised by your last question.

21:40.610 --> 21:42.323
The last question is our defense, Alan,

21:42.323 --> 21:44.779
which is the reason
I need you to close.

21:44.779 --> 21:47.104
Close? I still don't even know
what I'm doing on this case, much less…

21:47.104 --> 21:48.923
–You're on this case to close.
–Shirley.

21:48.923 --> 21:52.703
I'll buy you a drink and explain.
Meet me in my office at 8:00.

21:54.786 --> 21:57.287
What's going on?

21:57.287 --> 21:59.369
I haven't the slightest idea
what's going on.

21:59.369 --> 22:01.323
I'm on this case for
no apparent reason.

22:01.323 --> 22:02.793
Catherine.

22:02.793 --> 22:03.943
Oh, hello, dear.

22:03.943 --> 22:06.994
I do not want you befriending
Bernard Ferrion.

22:06.994 --> 22:09.494
Gee, you say that almost as if
it's any of your business.

22:09.494 --> 22:13.885
The man has murdered two people.
It is unsafe for you to keep his company.

22:13.885 --> 22:17.490
–I've managed to survive for 82 years…
–He is dangerous, and he…

22:17.490 --> 22:20.428
–My word would be “desperate.”
–Catherine,

22:20.428 --> 22:23.242
Bernard Ferrion is evil.
He will likely murder again,

22:23.242 --> 22:28.396
and you, if ever there was a person
who deserved a whack on the head…

22:30.371 --> 22:33.323
God…

22:37.810 --> 22:40.304
What?

22:45.363 --> 22:48.164
I absolutely planned to marry her.

22:48.164 --> 22:51.782
Well? What happened, Mike?

22:51.782 --> 22:54.452
I just… I panicked.

22:54.452 --> 22:56.087
At that particular moment?

22:56.087 --> 22:59.838
Look, I had a phobic kind of thing
about losing control of my life.

22:59.838 --> 23:02.367
Frannie, she, 
she picked out the caterer,

23:02.367 --> 23:06.092
the church, the minister,
the reception hall, and it just hit me.

23:06.092 --> 23:08.006
That wedding was 
a microcosm of marriage,

23:08.006 --> 23:11.484
with every decision
to be made by her.

23:11.484 --> 23:12.992
I just panicked.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.873
Didn't you think of how embarrassing
it would be for her?

23:14.873 --> 23:18.438
And for me, too. I was the one 
standing up there looking like an idiot,

23:18.438 --> 23:21.757
but we were at the “speak now or
forever hold your peace” part.

23:21.757 --> 23:23.942
What other choice did I have?

23:23.942 --> 23:25.673
Thank you.

23:27.720 --> 23:31.053
I must say, we've all just seen
the best of Donny Crane.

23:31.053 --> 23:33.709
–Objection.
–Withdrawn, withdrawn.

23:35.963 --> 23:38.321
Mitch, may I…
may I call you Mitch?

23:38.321 --> 23:40.297
My name's Michael.

23:40.297 --> 23:44.433
As I understand your testimony,
you just weren't ready to get married.

23:44.433 --> 23:47.084
That's right. –It's a huge decision.
It affects your whole life.

23:47.084 --> 23:48.336
–Yes.
–It affects her life.

23:48.336 --> 23:49.571
Of course.

23:49.571 --> 23:52.927
You, you seem like a considerate
sort of guy. Are you?

23:52.927 --> 23:55.881
–I think so.
–You must've sensed that, uh,

23:55.881 --> 24:01.027
when you left her at the altar like that,
it would be a big number on her.

24:01.027 --> 24:04.262
You weren't insensitive to that.

24:04.412 --> 24:06.831
No, but again…

24:06.831 --> 24:09.407
what else could I have done?
–Well, yes.

24:09.407 --> 24:13.695
Would it be unreasonable to say….

24:13.695 --> 24:17.646
that the groom incurs a duty
to perhaps sort out his feelings

24:17.646 --> 24:19.843
before 30 minutes
into the ceremony?

24:19.843 --> 24:22.309
–Well, uh…
–That's not unreasonable, is it?

24:22.309 --> 24:24.677
for the groom to be sure before
he walks down the aisle?

24:24.677 --> 24:27.362
Is that unreasonable?

24:29.677 --> 24:32.581
I guess not.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.501
Ever tell her you're sorry?

24:35.501 --> 24:38.544
–Of course I did.
–Want to tell her now?

24:45.462 --> 24:49.511
Frannie, I'm sorry.

24:51.008 --> 24:54.388
–And, Mitch…
–My name's Michael.

24:54.595 --> 24:56.315
What's your lawyer's name?

24:56.315 --> 24:58.372
–Donny Crane.
–What's my name?

24:58.372 --> 25:00.734
–Denny Crane.
–Big difference, isn't there?

25:00.734 --> 25:02.694
–Move to strike.
–Mr Crane.

25:02.694 --> 25:04.603
Now you got it.

25:04.716 --> 25:06.512
Lock and load.

25:09.491 --> 25:11.013
I love the law.

25:21.634 --> 25:23.563
And what exactly is your defense?

25:23.563 --> 25:25.805
Something like let him go,
even though he did it.

25:25.805 --> 25:27.084
Jury nullification.

25:27.084 --> 25:31.167
Best I can tell, though Shirley
hasn't really filled me in.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.472
–Talking about me?
–Yes, Shirley,

25:33.472 --> 25:35.388
if you so enjoy
keeping me in the dark,

25:35.388 --> 25:38.300
you really should give me a try…

25:38.300 --> 25:39.549
in the dark.

25:39.549 --> 25:40.886
Thank you.

25:40.886 --> 25:44.570
Actually, it's your love of the dark
that got you on this case.

25:44.570 --> 25:47.243
Are we still on for 8:00?

25:47.804 --> 25:51.309
See, that evidently was supposed
to mean something.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.436
Excuse me. Bernie!

25:55.475 --> 25:56.917
What are you doing here?

25:56.917 --> 26:01.303
Uh, I'm, uh, picking up Catherine.
We're grabbing a bite.

26:01.303 --> 26:04.213
Bernie, I like Catherine Piper.
I very much want her to go on living,

26:04.213 --> 26:08.686
the chances of which are lessened
if she keeps your company.

26:09.154 --> 26:11.505
–Go screw yourself.
–What did you just say to me?

26:11.505 --> 26:14.304
You heard me.
It's not like me to curse.

26:14.304 --> 26:16.887
I've only said it once
before in my entire life.

26:16.887 --> 26:20.075
–Undoubtedly to mother.
–Go screw yourself, Alan!

26:20.075 --> 26:24.214
–Now we're up to three times.
–I will not be berated by you, put down.

26:24.214 --> 26:25.793
Catherine, are you witnessing this?

26:25.793 --> 26:28.077
Why don't you give him 
a chance, for God's sake?

26:28.077 --> 26:29.782
How about we leave God out of this?

26:29.782 --> 26:31.581
I hired you to be a legal secretary,

26:31.581 --> 26:33.934
not to bring God or 
anybody else into the office,

26:33.934 --> 26:37.771
certainly not serial killers.

26:37.771 --> 26:39.596
Note the look on his face, Catherine.

26:39.596 --> 26:41.767
That's what's commonly known
as your psychotic glare.

26:41.767 --> 26:45.738
Don't anybody ask this man
to whip up an omelet.

26:45.877 --> 26:48.887
–You were my friend.
–And I thought you were mine.

26:48.887 --> 26:51.405
And you know what you did
to me after I got you out?

26:51.405 --> 26:53.006
You killed again.

26:53.006 --> 26:55.648
You got blood on my hands
that will never come out.

26:55.648 --> 27:00.422
Friends don't do that, Bernie.
Friends don't do that.

27:03.139 --> 27:05.270
Oh, you.

27:10.064 --> 27:13.899
Your continued staring suggests
a point of view, Tara.

27:13.899 --> 27:17.687
If you've got one, please share it.

27:27.678 --> 27:32.403
This is every woman's, perhaps
every man's greatest nightmare,

27:32.403 --> 27:40.018
being left at the altar in front of all
our family, our closest friends, our boss.

27:40.018 --> 27:44.381
There is no greater humiliation.
And it could happen to anybody.

27:44.381 --> 27:47.552
It could happen to you.

27:47.856 --> 27:52.474
Your granddaughter, your son.

27:52.474 --> 27:54.367
Me.

27:54.367 --> 28:00.122
We gotta send a message right now
to every bride and every groom.

28:00.122 --> 28:02.684
You wanna have 
a change of heart?

28:02.684 --> 28:04.299
Fine.

28:04.299 --> 28:10.466
But have the decency to have it
before you walk down the aisle.

28:10.466 --> 28:14.810
And there's only one way to
really send that message, isn't there?

28:14.810 --> 28:17.276
Money.

28:19.073 --> 28:21.324
What would you have him do?

28:21.324 --> 28:25.564
The ceremony somehow takes 
precedence over the institution itself?

28:25.564 --> 28:28.100
The goal is to avoid 
embarrassment now?

28:28.100 --> 28:29.744
This is marriage.

28:29.744 --> 28:32.850
For God's sake, 
“till death do us part.”

28:32.850 --> 28:36.197
“Let no man tear asunder.”

28:36.197 --> 28:38.994
Now, my client did 
the honorable thing.

28:38.994 --> 28:43.447
He refused to take vows
he didn't feel he could live up to.

28:43.447 --> 28:48.349
And does anybody here
really feel he should have?

28:48.728 --> 28:52.536
This is marriage.

29:16.138 --> 29:18.712
It's simply insane
for me to give the closing

29:18.712 --> 29:20.754
after you've handled all the witnesses.

29:20.754 --> 29:23.493
The jury has no relationship with me.

29:23.493 --> 29:25.863
I can only guess that 
you must want one.

29:25.863 --> 29:28.122
Is that what this is all about,

29:28.122 --> 29:31.524
your unconscious desire to bed me?

29:51.672 --> 29:53.745
You have undoubtedly 
seen this footage.

29:53.745 --> 29:56.052
Along with the rest of the world.

29:56.052 --> 29:59.220
It happened in Los Angeles.
What's it got to do with us?

29:59.220 --> 30:02.635
Two of the officers were disciplined,
and they then sued.

30:02.635 --> 30:05.999
They were just awarded 
$2.4 million last month.

30:05.999 --> 30:08.511
Is there a moral?

30:08.511 --> 30:10.880
This brings us to the dark.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.241
The jury in that case

30:13.241 --> 30:18.378
somehow found it in their conscience
to pay those officers millions of dollars.

30:18.378 --> 30:22.467
Obviously, there was
some human nature in play.

30:22.467 --> 30:26.042
We need to stand up 
in front of our jury

30:26.042 --> 30:32.033
and tell them what our client
did was a good thing.

30:32.033 --> 30:35.111
It's not in me to sell that.

30:35.111 --> 30:38.496
And you think it's in me.

30:40.753 --> 30:43.915
I certainly don't know all of you, Alan,

30:43.915 --> 30:45.792
perhaps not even much.

30:45.792 --> 30:52.927
But you seem to have a capacity
to see darkness in people's hearts.

30:54.123 --> 30:59.805
I need you to exploit
the ugliness in human nature

30:59.805 --> 31:03.227
in a way that I cannot.

31:08.580 --> 31:13.586
I think you're underestimating your own
capacity to see darkness in hearts.

31:22.761 --> 31:25.262
He doesn't get to be above the law
because he's a policeman.

31:25.262 --> 31:30.056
He doesn't get to be exempt from the law
because there was a fortuitous result.

31:30.056 --> 31:34.445
He beat up an innocent man,
fractured a cheekbone,

31:34.445 --> 31:36.996
broke an arm, 
put him in the hospital.

31:36.996 --> 31:42.117
This was an aggravated assault.
It was torture.

31:43.042 --> 31:47.061
Paul Harris didn't have specific information
as to the whereabouts of the suspect.

31:47.061 --> 31:51.216
All he had was a general idea
of the places he liked to frequent.

31:51.216 --> 31:54.268
For that…

31:54.268 --> 31:56.971
you saw what happened to him.

32:13.267 --> 32:16.286
The truth is, as Americans,

32:16.286 --> 32:18.358
we love torture.

32:18.358 --> 32:20.338
We keep it to ourselves,
of course, but come on,

32:20.338 --> 32:23.493
when it comes to evil doers,

32:23.493 --> 32:25.935
torture's okay.

32:25.935 --> 32:29.227
Hollywood certainly knows that.
Dirty Harry, boom,

32:29.227 --> 32:31.116
Charles Bronson in “death wish,”

32:31.116 --> 32:33.184
Denzel Washington in “man on fire”,

32:33.184 --> 32:35.227
heroes torturing the bad guys.

32:35.227 --> 32:40.948
In theaters all across the country,
we cheered. We like torture.

32:41.014 --> 32:44.397
Is there potential for abuse?
Without question.

32:44.397 --> 32:49.394
The events at Abu Ghraib prison
were deplorable.

32:49.394 --> 32:53.880
But do we really believe
they just happened in a vacuum?

32:55.014 --> 32:56.937
Alberto Gonzales, 
our attorney general,

32:56.937 --> 33:00.823
wrote a memo to the administration
saying torture's okay.

33:00.823 --> 33:03.529
Our supreme court just recently held

33:03.529 --> 33:06.756
that evidence gained from torture
can be used in trials.

33:06.756 --> 33:11.976
Alan Dershowitz, one of the leading
civil rights activists in our country,

33:11.976 --> 33:17.456
raised the idea of using torture warrants
so as at least to be more open about it.

33:17.456 --> 33:20.656
Torture warrants.
Love that torture.

33:24.098 --> 33:27.879
Mr Preston talks about the victim here
being an innocent man.

33:27.879 --> 33:29.801
Now, come on, 
he wasn't that innocent.

33:29.801 --> 33:34.733
He did harbor a fugitive,
one who kidnaps and kills children.

33:34.733 --> 33:39.180
He did have information that ultimately
led to the rescue of the child here.

33:39.180 --> 33:43.819
And he refused to give it up
until he was…

33:43.965 --> 33:45.913
coerced.

33:45.913 --> 33:48.240
As for my client being above the law,

33:48.240 --> 33:52.533
well, the law in this country
has always been subject to evolving

33:52.533 --> 33:54.958
community standards of humanity.

33:54.958 --> 33:59.477
So the 12 of you get to go back there,
as a community, and ask yourselves,

33:59.477 --> 34:02.328
“was this a good thing or not?”

34:03.351 --> 34:06.012
He's happy.
He's alive.

34:06.012 --> 34:09.313
They're sure as hell happy.

34:09.623 --> 34:15.118
My client saved a life,
that little boy's life.

34:15.565 --> 34:16.902
If it were your child,

34:16.902 --> 34:22.181
wouldn't you want the police to do
whatever was necessary?

34:22.181 --> 34:25.175
This officer got the job done

34:25.175 --> 34:29.356
using a method that our government,
our military, our attorney general,

34:29.356 --> 34:33.196
and, yes, even our supreme court
has said is sometimes okay.

34:33.196 --> 34:38.793
Sometimes. Depending on
the situation, torture's okay.

34:40.646 --> 34:43.333
Just don't tell anybody.

35:00.236 --> 35:02.597
Madam foreperson, the jury
has reached a verdict?

35:02.597 --> 35:04.542
–We have, your honor.
–What say you?

35:04.542 --> 35:08.931
On the question of liability,
we find in favor of the plaintiff.

35:08.931 --> 35:10.848
On the question of damages,

35:10.848 --> 35:16.335
we order the defendant to pay
the plaintiff the amount of $1.6 million.

35:18.911 --> 35:21.716
Thank you. 
The jury is dismissed.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.794
1.6? Oh, my God.

35:25.869 --> 35:27.355
I'm sorry.

35:27.355 --> 35:29.791
You said we'd win.

36:05.270 --> 36:09.682
Your first mistake was letting me
push your buttons in there.

36:10.230 --> 36:14.233
Your second was not preparing
your client for cross.

36:14.233 --> 36:18.153
He admitted fault.
He admitted the harm was foreseeable.

36:18.153 --> 36:23.918
You let me frame the issue as the groom's
duty to be sure before the ceremony.

36:23.918 --> 36:26.185
Once we got that, we won.

36:26.185 --> 36:30.707
Never ever let the other side
frame the issue, son.

36:33.461 --> 36:36.963
I'm not your son.

36:45.078 --> 36:48.472
Could you please go?

37:00.534 --> 37:03.615
Your third mistake…

37:03.928 --> 37:07.774
the definition of a father…

37:07.774 --> 37:09.856
it's a sliding scale.

37:09.856 --> 37:14.631
Some are great, some are terrible,
and most are in between.

37:14.631 --> 37:18.388
I may not have been around much,

37:19.298 --> 37:22.046
but I was always there
when you needed me.

37:22.046 --> 37:24.559
Still I am.

37:26.025 --> 37:28.840
And I've always loved you.

37:32.165 --> 37:34.512
Still do.

37:48.873 --> 37:51.455
Will the defendant please rise?

37:52.384 --> 37:54.233
The jury has reached 
a unanimous verdict?

37:54.233 --> 37:56.717
–We have, your honor.
–Please state your verdict.

37:56.717 --> 37:59.443
In the matter of the Commonwealth
versus Wayne Kirkland,

37:59.443 --> 38:03.187
read the charge of aggravated assault,
we find the defendant Wayne Kirkland

38:03.187 --> 38:05.140
not guilty.

38:05.140 --> 38:07.690
–Congratulations.
–Thank you very much.

38:07.690 --> 38:10.570
–Thank you for everything.
–You're welcome, sir.

38:15.188 --> 38:16.956
Thank you, Alan.

38:16.956 --> 38:19.181
And I apologize if I offended you.

38:19.181 --> 38:22.010
Nonsense, you paid great tribute
to my lawyering skill, Shirley.

38:22.010 --> 38:24.626
What higher compliment 
could there be?

38:25.909 --> 38:29.513
Alan, listen, I….

38:29.513 --> 38:34.666
your capacity to see darkness,
we all have it, I suppose, including me.

38:34.666 --> 38:37.241
My point is…

38:37.241 --> 38:40.104
it was simply a dirty job
and I chose to let you do it.

38:40.104 --> 38:42.691
No, the point is I was willing to do it

38:42.691 --> 38:46.582
and you somehow saw that.

39:13.859 --> 39:16.987
Your secretary said 
you wanted to see me.

39:17.401 --> 39:19.608
She told you that?

39:19.608 --> 39:22.597
Is there some reason
why she shouldn't have?

39:22.597 --> 39:26.300
I said I wanted to see you naked.

39:26.724 --> 39:29.364
I don't suppose there's
much chance of that.

39:30.044 --> 39:31.355
I'll let you see me naked.

39:31.355 --> 39:34.325
Now there's definitely no chance.

39:34.898 --> 39:38.798
Well, now that you're here,

39:40.280 --> 39:42.017
you tried a good case, soldier.

39:42.017 --> 39:44.339
You're an excellent lawyer.

39:44.339 --> 39:47.532
Thank you.
Tell a friend.

39:57.313 --> 39:59.277
Drinking without me?

39:59.775 --> 40:01.787
I'm never without you.

40:01.787 --> 40:03.296
Nice coat. New?

40:03.296 --> 40:04.945
$3,500.

40:04.945 --> 40:07.145
It's good to have money.
Don't you love having money?

40:07.145 --> 40:09.414
–It means we're successful.
–Happy.

40:09.414 --> 40:10.930
Fat.

40:11.194 --> 40:14.088
It's all good.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.459
How'd your trial go?

40:17.459 --> 40:19.247
We won. You?

40:19.247 --> 40:21.047
Victory.

40:21.047 --> 40:23.522
Success.

40:25.334 --> 40:28.188
Goes well with having money.

40:28.632 --> 40:31.211
We're winners.
That's what we are.

40:31.211 --> 40:34.424
Yep. Salud.
Here's to the winners.
