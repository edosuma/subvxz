WEBVTT

00:06.331 --> 00:10.201
Step right up
and try to win a prize.

00:10.202 --> 00:13.372
This rubber lizard is ready
to fly.

00:13.372 --> 00:16.072
Is the practice game ready?

00:16.074 --> 00:17.514
Woah!

00:17.509 --> 00:20.039
Zuma:
Woah.

00:20.045 --> 00:23.045
That lizard has pretty good aim.

00:23.048 --> 00:23.808
(laughing)

00:23.816 --> 00:26.716
I'm totally excited
about the carnival.

00:26.718 --> 00:27.918
I've never won a prize before.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.920
Here, I'll show you how to
win a prize.

00:30.923 --> 00:34.163
You just aim and...

00:34.159 --> 00:35.889
Lift off!

00:35.894 --> 00:36.994
Bullseye!

00:36.995 --> 00:38.355
Good one, skye.

00:38.363 --> 00:43.133
If I can do that at the carnival
I'll win another stuffed animal

00:43.135 --> 00:45.695
For my collection. Look!

00:45.704 --> 00:47.044
(grunting)

00:47.039 --> 00:48.739
(laughing) ruff!

00:48.740 --> 00:53.180
Woah, those are
awesome!

00:53.178 --> 00:56.948
Okay zuma, you can do this.

00:56.949 --> 00:57.979
No I can't.

00:57.983 --> 01:00.153
You just need a little more
practice.

01:00.152 --> 01:03.492
This time, put more paw into it.

01:03.489 --> 01:05.759
(clanking)

01:05.757 --> 01:07.087
(rustling)

01:07.092 --> 01:09.092
(squeaking)

01:09.094 --> 01:11.194
(thudding)

01:11.196 --> 01:12.056
Sorry, ryder.

01:12.064 --> 01:14.734
(sighing) I'll never win a
prize.

01:14.733 --> 01:16.033
Don't give up,
zuma.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.004
You've got lots of
time to practice.

01:18.003 --> 01:21.003
The carnival will be
going on all day.

01:21.006 --> 01:24.066
Friends, neighbors,
and visitors,

01:24.076 --> 01:30.146
Chickaletta and I now declare
the adventure bay carnival open!

01:30.148 --> 01:32.318
(cheering)

01:36.989 --> 01:38.959
Giddy up, cornelius.
Come on.

01:38.957 --> 01:41.017
(oinking)

01:41.026 --> 01:44.326
Ahoy, adventure bay maties!
Come bounce in this

01:44.329 --> 01:49.369
Perfectly puffy pirate palace.
Argh!

01:49.368 --> 01:51.328
(kids cheering)

01:53.071 --> 01:53.801
Hm?

01:53.805 --> 01:56.035
Step right up to
the lizard launcher.

01:56.041 --> 02:00.411
Hit the bullseye and win an
adorable bunny toy.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.512
Mm.

02:01.513 --> 02:02.283
(chomping)

02:02.281 --> 02:07.151
An adventure bay carnival?
Ha, boring!

02:07.152 --> 02:10.092
(mewling)

02:10.088 --> 02:15.228
Really? You want some of those
silly toys?

02:15.227 --> 02:16.557
(sighing) fine.

02:16.562 --> 02:18.562
Mayor goodway, I'll take six.

02:18.564 --> 02:21.834
Not so fast,
mayor humdinger.

02:21.833 --> 02:22.803
You can only win a prize

02:22.801 --> 02:26.001
If you hit the middle of
the target with a lizard.

02:26.004 --> 02:28.374
Ha-ha, of course I'll hit it,

02:28.373 --> 02:32.513
I'm the master of all
carnival games.

02:32.511 --> 02:33.411
(thudding)

02:33.412 --> 02:34.952
Oh, that's a miss.

02:34.947 --> 02:35.807
(growling angrily)

02:35.814 --> 02:39.084
Oh, is that a giant
white chicken?

02:39.084 --> 02:41.254
Where?

02:41.253 --> 02:43.293
(whooshing)

02:43.288 --> 02:44.188
(giggling)

02:44.189 --> 02:45.359
Ah, my mistake.

02:45.357 --> 02:47.987
It was just a chicken-y
shaped cloud.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.263
Now, where's my prize?

02:49.261 --> 02:53.931
Sorry, but you very clearly
missed the middle of the target

02:53.932 --> 02:55.472
With your-- lizard?

02:55.467 --> 02:58.937
But, it wasn't on the bullseye
a moment ago.

02:58.937 --> 03:02.067
How in the world
did it get there?

03:02.074 --> 03:02.514
Oh!

03:02.507 --> 03:05.477
There's a mustardy kitten print
on this lizard!

03:05.477 --> 03:08.977
While you had us looking at
chicken clouds,

03:08.981 --> 03:11.311
Your meowing minion moved it.

03:11.316 --> 03:11.946
Meow?

03:11.950 --> 03:16.550
Mayor humdinger, you are banned
from this game for cheating,

03:16.555 --> 03:17.485
And so is your kitten.

03:17.489 --> 03:20.519
Who's to say that's
from my mustardy kitty?

03:20.525 --> 03:25.355
I think you're just afraid I'll
win all your stuffed animals.

03:25.364 --> 03:27.264
Ha! Let's go, kittens.

03:27.265 --> 03:31.325
If I can't win a prize,
then no one will.

03:31.336 --> 03:36.136
Time to create a little
distraction catastrophe crew.

03:36.141 --> 03:39.041
(laughing)

03:41.013 --> 03:43.253
Huh? What?
(pig oinking)

03:43.248 --> 03:45.648
(evil giggling)

03:45.651 --> 03:49.121
Ah! Now, settle down, corny!

03:49.121 --> 03:50.151
(gasping)

03:50.155 --> 03:52.355
Runaway pig! Lookout!

03:52.357 --> 03:52.957
Oops!

03:52.958 --> 03:55.988
(pig oinking, mayor shrieking)

03:55.994 --> 03:59.264
Chickaletta!

03:59.264 --> 04:00.264
(tires rattling)

04:00.265 --> 04:01.895
(pig oinking)

04:01.900 --> 04:03.470
Phew.

04:03.468 --> 04:05.038
(gasping)

04:05.037 --> 04:05.697
Oh no!

04:05.704 --> 04:09.274
The adorable bunny toys
are gone!

04:09.274 --> 04:13.144
Nothing's left but a teensy bit
of stuffing.

04:13.145 --> 04:15.905
(beeping)

04:15.914 --> 04:18.113
(phone ringing)

04:18.116 --> 04:21.216
Hi, mayor goodway. How's it
going down at the carnival?

04:21.219 --> 04:23.319
<i> Ryder, the carnival's a</i>
<i> catastrophe!</i>

04:23.321 --> 04:27.491
<i> Corny's on the loose and the</i>
<i> prizes have vanished.</i>

04:27.492 --> 04:28.592
We'll hustle over.

04:28.593 --> 04:31.963
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

04:31.963 --> 04:33.163
(beeping)

04:33.165 --> 04:35.665
Paw patrol, to the lookout!

04:35.667 --> 04:38.167
Pups:
Ryder needs us.

04:38.170 --> 04:39.370
(barking)

04:39.371 --> 04:40.401
(gasping)

04:40.405 --> 04:42.165
Woah!

04:42.174 --> 04:42.814
(thudding)

04:42.808 --> 04:44.168
Marshall:
Look out!

04:44.176 --> 04:44.706
(crashing)

04:44.710 --> 04:48.140
Well, zuma, your aim's
getting better.

04:48.146 --> 04:50.706
(laughing)

04:52.000 --> 04:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:00.025 --> 05:02.885
(elevator dinging)

05:05.163 --> 05:08.473
Paw patrol ready for action,
ryder, sir!

05:08.467 --> 05:09.127
(beeping)

05:09.134 --> 05:10.434
There's trouble
at the carnival, pups.

05:10.435 --> 05:14.635
Cornelius has escaped from the
pig ride and is running loose.

05:14.639 --> 05:15.409
<i> (gasping)</i>

05:15.407 --> 05:19.737
And the prizes are missing from
the lizard launcher game.

05:19.745 --> 05:21.075
<i> Oh!</i>

05:21.079 --> 05:21.579
(gasping)

05:21.580 --> 05:23.980
Zuma & skye:
Not the prizes!

05:23.982 --> 05:24.482
Chase,

05:24.483 --> 05:28.493
I'll need your megaphone and
herding skills to coral corny.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.747
Chase is on the case.

05:30.756 --> 05:31.546
Skye,

05:31.556 --> 05:35.486
We'll need you to search for the
missing prizes from the air.

05:35.494 --> 05:37.764
Ruff! Let's take to the sky.

05:37.763 --> 05:41.803
All right! Paw patrol
is on a roll!

05:41.800 --> 05:45.800
(barking)

05:45.804 --> 05:47.574
paw patrol

05:47.572 --> 05:48.812
(barking)

05:48.807 --> 05:50.667
go, go, go, go!

05:50.675 --> 05:51.565
paw patrol

05:51.576 --> 05:53.076
go, go, go, go!

05:53.078 --> 05:54.208
Yeah!

05:54.212 --> 05:55.252
(barking)

05:55.247 --> 05:56.277
Yeah!

05:56.281 --> 05:58.481
(barking)

06:02.654 --> 06:03.754
chase!

06:03.755 --> 06:04.585
Ruff!

06:04.589 --> 06:06.859
go, go, go, go!

06:06.858 --> 06:08.828
go, go, go, go!

06:08.827 --> 06:10.327
go, go, go, go!

06:10.328 --> 06:11.328
paw patrol

06:11.329 --> 06:12.599
(siren wailing)

06:12.597 --> 06:14.657
go, go, go, go!

06:14.666 --> 06:15.766
skye!

06:15.767 --> 06:17.767
go, go, go, go!

06:17.769 --> 06:20.339
go, go, go, go!

06:20.338 --> 06:21.598
go, go, go, go!

06:21.606 --> 06:25.476
paw patrol, paw patrol

06:25.477 --> 06:28.577
(tires screeching)

06:28.580 --> 06:29.710
(sirens wailing)

06:29.714 --> 06:32.754
(revving)

06:32.751 --> 06:37.191
(sirens wailing)

06:43.094 --> 06:44.734
Let's go, chase.

06:44.729 --> 06:45.799
(squealing)

06:45.797 --> 06:46.727
(crashing)

06:46.731 --> 06:49.671
Folks, please clear the way!

06:49.668 --> 06:51.268
(squealing)

06:51.269 --> 06:52.199
Ruff! Ruff!

06:52.204 --> 06:54.744
Corny, come back here!

06:54.739 --> 06:57.239
(grunting)

06:57.242 --> 06:58.512
(chomping)

06:58.510 --> 07:02.380
(squealing)

07:03.882 --> 07:05.652
Thanks for the ride, corny.

07:05.650 --> 07:06.920
(sighing) there.

07:06.918 --> 07:11.548
Great work, but I still can't
figure out how corny got loose.

07:12.457 --> 07:15.757
Hm, I know somebody who loves
yarn balls.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.390
Actually,
six somebody's.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.556
(sniffing) ah!
Ah-choo!

07:20.565 --> 07:21.555
Definitely kittens.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.926
Skye, any sign of
the stuffed toys?

07:24.936 --> 07:26.366
Not yet. Wait!

07:26.371 --> 07:29.841
I see some fluffy stuffing
leading to the playground.

07:29.841 --> 07:31.411
Nice find, skye.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.379
It probably come from inside the
missing stuffed animals.

07:34.379 --> 07:37.279
Come on, chase.
To the playground.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.582
Ruff!

07:38.583 --> 07:40.423
(sirens wailing)

07:40.418 --> 07:41.578
Look what I found.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.286
(meowing)

07:43.288 --> 07:44.588
Ryder:
Just as I suspected,

07:44.589 --> 07:48.519
The kitty catastrophe
crew's behind this.

07:48.526 --> 07:49.886
Ruff!
Megaphone!

07:49.895 --> 07:52.225
(electronic humming)

07:52.230 --> 07:53.800
Attention kitties!

07:53.798 --> 07:57.768
Step away from the bunny toys!

07:57.769 --> 07:59.739
(meowing)

07:59.738 --> 08:00.438
Uh oh!

08:00.438 --> 08:02.438
The kittens are making a
getaway with some of

08:02.440 --> 08:03.310
The stuffed bunnies!

08:03.308 --> 08:04.838
Rubble, bring your rake
to the playground to

08:04.843 --> 08:07.043
Pick up the prizes and
take them to the booth.

08:07.045 --> 08:10.775
<i> A shovel full of stuffed</i>
<i> bunnies, cool!</i>

08:10.782 --> 08:14.722
Chase, skye, we have
some kittens to catch.

08:17.589 --> 08:19.519
(beeping)

08:19.524 --> 08:20.324
Skye:
Ryder,

08:20.325 --> 08:21.925
The kittens are back at
the carnival,

08:21.927 --> 08:24.487
And they're heading for
the bouncy castle.

08:24.496 --> 08:26.056
Good eye, skye.

08:26.064 --> 08:30.474
Okay, it's time for the next
bunch of boisterous bouncers

08:30.468 --> 08:31.628
To take a turn.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.796
(meowing)
hey!

08:33.804 --> 08:35.565
Woah!

08:37.442 --> 08:38.712
Uh-oh!

08:38.710 --> 08:39.980
I'll save you!

08:39.977 --> 08:41.707
Woah! Oof!

08:41.712 --> 08:44.513
(scared meowing)

08:44.749 --> 08:45.919
Ryder, thank goodness
you're here.

08:45.917 --> 08:47.847
A dangerous disaster is
developing.

08:47.852 --> 08:51.222
Those furry felines are floating
off fast!

08:51.222 --> 08:52.562
Someone save my kitties!

08:52.557 --> 08:57.427
Zuma, we need you at the bay to
rescue a castaway castle.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.829
<i> Let's dive in!</i>

08:59.831 --> 09:01.501
(scared meowing)

09:01.499 --> 09:03.329
(revving)

09:03.335 --> 09:07.565
Zuma, use your buoy and tow the
castle back to shore.

09:07.572 --> 09:11.272
Ruff! Ruff! Buoy!

09:11.276 --> 09:12.336
(whistling)

09:12.344 --> 09:14.444
(scared meowing)

09:14.446 --> 09:16.306
(revving)

09:16.314 --> 09:17.684
(splashing)

09:17.682 --> 09:20.782
(creaking)

09:20.785 --> 09:24.445
Uh oh, ryder,
the buoy slipped off.

09:24.456 --> 09:27.586
(scared meowing)

09:27.592 --> 09:30.492
We have to get those poor
kittens out of the castle

09:30.495 --> 09:31.625
Before it floats out to sea.

09:31.629 --> 09:36.269
I have an idea, get ready to
play catch, ryder.

09:38.336 --> 09:39.366
(grunting)

09:39.371 --> 09:41.041
(yelping)

09:41.039 --> 09:44.269
Great aim. Keep going.

09:45.910 --> 09:47.540
(yelping)

09:47.545 --> 09:50.705
Awesome, zuma. I'll get the
kittens in to shore,

09:50.715 --> 09:52.875
Then we can both bring the
castle back in.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.394
(revving)

09:55.387 --> 09:56.947
(hammering)

09:56.955 --> 09:58.015
Captain turbot:
Thanks, rocky.

09:58.023 --> 10:01.793
No pesky pets will pull
up these perfectly pounded

10:01.793 --> 10:02.633
Pirate palace pegs!

10:02.627 --> 10:07.327
Adorable little stuffed bunnies
coming through.

10:07.332 --> 10:08.702
Thank you, paw patrol,

10:08.700 --> 10:11.170
For saving the bouncy castle
and the prizes!

10:11.169 --> 10:15.639
Whenever you have a problem,
just yelp for help,

10:15.640 --> 10:16.840
Or meow.

10:16.841 --> 10:17.871
Huh? Oh, yes.

10:17.876 --> 10:22.546
Thanks for saving those prize
swiping kittens.

10:22.547 --> 10:23.077
(growling)

10:23.081 --> 10:27.751
I still don't get what the big
fuss is about those toys anyway.

10:27.752 --> 10:32.692
Oh! Hee-hee. Oh, how did that
get there?

10:32.690 --> 10:33.990
Ha-ha, yes.

10:33.992 --> 10:37.462
Now, who wants to play
launch the lizard?

10:37.462 --> 10:38.802
Ready to give it
another try, zuma?

10:38.797 --> 10:42.727
Somebody else should go,
I don't think I can do it.

10:42.734 --> 10:43.804
Yes, you can.

10:43.802 --> 10:46.672
If you can bounce a
kitten out of a castle,

10:46.671 --> 10:48.701
Bouncing a lizard's easy.

10:48.706 --> 10:50.906
Well, okay.

10:50.909 --> 10:51.669
(whooshing)

10:51.676 --> 10:52.936
pa-pa-pa-paw patrol

10:52.944 --> 10:54.814
(cheering)

10:54.813 --> 10:55.713
I did it!

10:55.713 --> 10:58.453
And, the pup wins a prize!

10:58.450 --> 10:59.720
Awesome!

10:59.717 --> 11:01.817
You're such
a good pup.
