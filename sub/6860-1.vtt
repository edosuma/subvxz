Darth Maul and Savage Opress spread chaos

00:21.608 --> 00:23.879
as they descend on the outer rim.

00:23.913 --> 00:26.654
After rescuing his brother from despair,

00:26.689 --> 00:30.437
Savage and Maul murder
and pillage at every turn.

00:30.472 --> 00:32.807
Fueled by rage and vengeance,

00:32.841 --> 00:35.244
they search for meaning
in their new alliance

00:35.280 --> 00:37.451

Sd-357, have you found
anyone in the South passage?

01:17.048 --> 01:19.888

02:01.065 --> 02:04.974
Look, brother, a fortune.

02:05.042 --> 02:08.945
True fortune will be the demise of Kenobi.

02:08.979 --> 02:12.386
Credit chips are meaningless
without a plan to survive.

02:12.421 --> 02:15.461
The Jedi are hunting us.

02:15.495 --> 02:17.799
We will be forced to make a stand.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.469
And we will deal with them.

02:20.503 --> 02:22.773
They are too many.

02:22.807 --> 02:26.715
To continue, we need one singular vision... 

02:26.749 --> 02:28.552
my vision.

02:28.587 --> 02:31.722
Brother, let us share our strength.

02:33.157 --> 02:36.294
There is no need for dominance between us.

02:36.329 --> 02:39.300
Always two there are, my brother,

02:39.335 --> 02:42.339
a master and an apprentice,

02:42.373 --> 02:45.540
and you are the apprentice.

02:47.177 --> 02:49.681
[Snarls]

02:49.716 --> 02:54.660

You have grown so powerful.

the Meridian sector,

Cybloc System.

03:33.206 --> 03:36.777
It is close enough to the earlier attack.

03:36.812 --> 03:38.314
I have a feeling it's them.

03:47.088 --> 03:49.560
They ought to be flush.

03:49.594 --> 03:50.895
Chips were all unlocked.

03:50.929 --> 03:52.662
No way to trace 'em.

All done by the two crabbiest Zabraks

03:55.330 --> 03:57.032
this side of the Hydian.

03:57.066 --> 03:59.036
They were alone?

03:59.070 --> 04:00.138
Yup, yup.

04:00.172 --> 04:01.408
What were they,

04:01.442 --> 04:03.880
a couple of Jedi gone rogue or something?

04:05.753 --> 04:08.487
They're not Jedi.

04:08.522 --> 04:09.555
Do me a favor.

04:09.589 --> 04:12.658
Spark up that lightsaber, would you?

04:12.693 --> 04:13.826
Mm-hmm.

04:13.861 --> 04:15.562
Well, the droids that got attacked

04:15.597 --> 04:18.836
said that theirs were red.

04:18.903 --> 04:20.738
They are Sith, and we need to find them

04:20.772 --> 04:22.874
before they strike again.

04:22.908 --> 04:26.110
Well, they took my cargo ship.

04:26.145 --> 04:27.912
The droid survivor said
they heard something

04:27.946 --> 04:30.348
about the Sertar sector.

04:36.088 --> 04:38.722
What is in the Sertar sector?

04:38.757 --> 04:40.391
That's where Florrum is.

04:40.425 --> 04:42.592
You've been there?

04:42.627 --> 04:44.060
What can we expect?

Get me a readout on that ship.

05:02.351 --> 05:05.651
There are life-forms aboard.

05:05.686 --> 05:09.452
The main reactor and
hyperdrive generator are down.

05:09.486 --> 05:11.154
I think they're stranded.

05:11.189 --> 05:12.256
[Laughs]

05:12.290 --> 05:13.992
And their communications?

05:14.027 --> 05:17.664
Operational but silenced.

05:17.699 --> 05:18.966
Mm.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.769
We'll kill anyone on
board and take the ship.

could serve us well.

06:25.509 --> 06:28.746
Are you... are you hiring us?

06:28.780 --> 06:31.151
What kind of Jedi are you?

06:31.186 --> 06:33.653
We are not Jedi.

06:33.688 --> 06:36.521
We are lords,

06:36.555 --> 06:38.722
crime lords.

06:38.756 --> 06:40.792
We work for Hondo.

06:40.826 --> 06:42.463
You'll have to pay us really well

06:42.531 --> 06:44.700
to get us to betray him.

06:44.735 --> 06:48.202
Money is of no object for men like us.

06:48.236 --> 06:51.769
You will have all that you desire and more

06:51.804 --> 06:55.778
if you pledge yourselves to me.

06:55.812 --> 06:58.513
All right.

06:58.548 --> 07:02.017
I'm tired of working for Hondo anyway.

07:02.051 --> 07:03.953
I'll call up a couple of the boys

07:03.987 --> 07:06.923
and see if they'll join us.

07:15.948 --> 07:20.584
I am certain captain Hondo
will never throw in with you.

07:20.618 --> 07:23.588
Hondo's base will soon be ours,

07:23.622 --> 07:25.926
and he will not survive this,

07:25.961 --> 07:30.763
unless he embraces the
same choice I give you now.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.734
Ha, I'm in.

07:35.768 --> 07:37.068
So am I.

07:37.102 --> 07:38.736
I am not sure.

07:38.770 --> 07:41.205
Let's see what Hondo says about that.

07:46.014 --> 07:47.517
Three of your lieutenants

07:47.584 --> 07:50.957
have already sworn allegiance to me.

07:50.992 --> 07:55.063
Traitors. Scum!

07:55.097 --> 07:56.866
I'm so proud... 

07:58.171 --> 08:01.543
but so betrayed.

08:01.578 --> 08:05.548

08:20.100 --> 08:23.237
I've had to deal with,

08:23.271 --> 08:28.180
and Hondo Ohnaka survives every time.

08:28.214 --> 08:30.615
We shall see.

08:33.619 --> 08:36.620
[Engines whooshing]

08:42.097 --> 08:45.533
We have a match on the cargo ship.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.638
It seems Maul and Savage have
picked up a pirate escort.

08:48.672 --> 08:51.741
Maybe to unload the stolen cargo.

08:51.776 --> 08:54.313
I'm not sure the pirate
Hondo would have an alliance

08:54.347 --> 08:56.717
with Maul and his brother.

08:56.751 --> 08:59.821
So you know this Hondo personally?

08:59.856 --> 09:03.891
Unfortunately, yes.

09:03.925 --> 09:08.533
Oi, Hondo, there's a Jedi contacting you.

09:08.567 --> 09:11.405
Says his name is Kenobi.

09:11.439 --> 09:12.740
Kenobi?

09:12.774 --> 09:14.042
Ha!

09:14.076 --> 09:16.509
My, aren't we popular today?

09:16.543 --> 09:18.210
Put him through. Go. Go. Go.

09:20.347 --> 09:21.914
Greetings, Hondo.

09:21.949 --> 09:23.285
Greetings?

09:23.319 --> 09:26.788
What kind of menace have
you brought to my planet now?

09:26.822 --> 09:29.057
First, you lose this system

09:29.091 --> 09:30.626
and Grievous comes in

09:30.660 --> 09:33.164
and destroys my entire stronghold,

09:33.231 --> 09:37.069
leaving me here to just
rummage through the leftovers

09:37.103 --> 09:39.474
of my once great empire.

09:39.509 --> 09:43.812
And now these two horned men show up.

09:43.846 --> 09:46.748
Who are these horny-headed maniacs?

09:46.784 --> 09:49.254
They don't seem like normal Jedi.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.925
Not Jedi, Hondo, Sith.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.427
We tracked them here.

09:53.462 --> 09:58.432
They just threatened to attack
with a group of my men... 

09:58.466 --> 09:59.998
my own men!

10:00.033 --> 10:01.798
Yes, we are looking at them right now,

10:01.866 --> 10:04.501
a cargo vessel and three of your starships.

10:04.536 --> 10:06.438
They are heading toward you, Hondo.

10:06.472 --> 10:09.110
Dadada, more to the point,

10:09.145 --> 10:11.483
are you going to help me when you get here?

10:11.517 --> 10:13.316
There's nothing we can do about your men,

10:13.351 --> 10:16.284
but we can certainly do
something about the Sith.

10:16.318 --> 10:18.955
Good. I'll deal with my men.

10:18.989 --> 10:22.095

13:43.005 --> 13:45.560
Take this cannon down to the hole.

13:46.037 --> 13:50.042
We will ambush those traitors there.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.082
Where are the rest of your men?

13:56.116 --> 13:58.050
They are setting up an ambush.

13:58.085 --> 13:59.786
We can use your help.

13:59.821 --> 14:01.455
Where is the other Jedi?

She's... she's dead.

I am semi-speechless.

14:11.604 --> 14:13.139
I think they went this way.

14:13.174 --> 14:14.675
Let's go down this hall here.

14:14.710 --> 14:16.178
I shall draw the brothers away.

14:16.213 --> 14:19.184
Once that's done, blast
the passageway closed.

14:19.219 --> 14:23.021
And leave you alone with the two crazies?

14:23.055 --> 14:24.255
Well, okay.

14:55.335 --> 14:57.138

14:57.173 --> 15:02.110
We are two, and you are
no match for us both.

15:02.144 --> 15:04.146
You are mistaken.

15:08.890 --> 15:12.690
Are you still willing to fight me?

15:12.725 --> 15:17.326
The horned men aren't
interested in helping you.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.432
They are only interested in Kenobi.

15:20.467 --> 15:23.437
[Grunting]

15:45.952 --> 15:48.520
They promised us wealth and power, boss.

Please don't kill us.

Kill you?

Oh, I would not kill you.

Everyone, the horned men's ship
is filled with valuable goods.

As your restored leader,

16:06.845 --> 16:09.948

Jiro, ready the men! We're leaving.

17:02.796 --> 17:06.601
My men aren't going anywhere with you.

17:06.635 --> 17:08.005
Look at them.

17:08.039 --> 17:09.773
How powerful can they be?

17:09.808 --> 17:12.977
They are running away from Kenobi.

17:13.011 --> 17:16.714
Filth, you will pay for your insolence.

17:16.749 --> 17:19.117
[Laughing] Insolence!

17:19.153 --> 17:20.788
We are pirates!

17:20.821 --> 17:22.894
We don't even know what that means.

17:22.928 --> 17:24.865
Open fire!

17:24.898 --> 17:27.667
If we kill those two,

17:27.702 --> 17:30.405
their riches will be ours!

17:30.439 --> 17:33.407
[Blasters firing]

17:47.757 --> 17:49.758
[Yells]

18:03.407 --> 18:05.441
[Ship crashes]

18:10.889 --> 18:12.154
[Blaster firing]

18:16.590 --> 18:19.260
[Engines rumbling]

18:22.401 --> 18:24.102
[Rocket blasts]

18:27.371 --> 18:28.770
[Panting]

18:28.805 --> 18:30.572
Our engines have been compromised.

18:30.607 --> 18:32.342
Get to the escape pod.

18:32.376 --> 18:34.946
It's too late.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.083
Trust me, apprentice.

19:00.563 --> 19:03.498
Well, Kenobi, let's get out there

19:03.532 --> 19:08.365
and see what riches have fallen
from the sky for me... and you.

19:08.399 --> 19:10.702
[Laughs]

19:10.737 --> 19:12.006
Shall we?

19:12.040 --> 19:14.744
Very well.

19:16.815 --> 19:19.814
[Engines whirring]

19:36.471 --> 19:39.008
There's no sign of those two, boss.

19:39.042 --> 19:44.047
Well, if the condition of
these goods is any indication,

19:44.081 --> 19:46.984
ah, your friends have been vaporized.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.087
I wouldn't be so sure.

19:49.122 --> 19:52.225
I cut one of them in half
once, and he survived.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.427
Well, isn't that interesting?

20:01.698 --> 20:05.702
I think we have closure on
this matter, master Kenobi.

20:05.736 --> 20:07.702
I disagree, Chancellor.

20:07.737 --> 20:09.203
Everything we've learned from this

20:09.237 --> 20:11.038
is that the Sith are persistent.

20:11.072 --> 20:12.872
They will not die.

20:12.907 --> 20:15.975
I understand your
reservations, Master Kenobi,

20:16.009 --> 20:18.110
but I am afraid we can no longer allow

20:18.145 --> 20:21.747
this personal matter of yours
to be a Republic concern.

20:21.781 --> 20:24.650
It does not appear this Darth Maul

20:24.684 --> 20:26.954
is a direct threat to the Republic.

20:26.989 --> 20:30.461
We need to redirect your
efforts to the cause at hand:

20:30.495 --> 20:35.004
Stopping Count Dooku and
thus ending the Clone Wars.

20:35.038 --> 20:38.441
Maul was trying to
build an army of pirates.

20:38.475 --> 20:39.942
So let him.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.045
Let him play with the rabble.

20:42.079 --> 20:44.280
They're just petty crooks.

20:44.315 --> 20:46.282
It is of no relevance to the senate

20:46.317 --> 20:48.619
compared to the separatist threat.

20:48.653 --> 20:51.423
Good day, gentlemen.

20:53.995 --> 20:56.464
Something is stirring in the underworld.

20:56.498 --> 20:59.000
The crime families have
had too much free rein

20:59.034 --> 21:01.837
since the Jedi have been
distracted by the clone war.

21:01.872 --> 21:05.108
I fear it is a fertile
place for Maul to flourish,

21:05.143 --> 21:06.910
if he has indeed survived.

21:06.944 --> 21:10.745
Hmm, right you may be, Obi-Wan,

21:10.780 --> 21:14.051
but heed the words of
the Chancellor we must.

21:14.086 --> 21:16.822
A personal matter this is for you.

21:16.856 --> 21:19.325
Clouded your judgment may be.

21:19.359 --> 21:21.829
In time, if he lives,

21:21.861 --> 21:24.662
reveal himself again Maul will.

21:24.697 --> 21:27.734
And then swiftly we shall act.

21:40.053 --> 21:41.956
