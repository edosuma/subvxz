01:15.780 --> 01:18.010
Hello. Shop at Home Network?

01:18.260 --> 01:22.219
<i>Yeah, I'd like to order your
NYPD Blue naked-butt...</i>

01:22.420 --> 01:24.490
...salt and pepper shakers.

01:24.740 --> 01:26.617
Mom. Don't you think
you should wait...

01:26.820 --> 01:29.175
...until Dad gets the raise
before you spend it all?

01:29.460 --> 01:32.611
Bud, if I waited to have things
till your father could afford them...

01:32.820 --> 01:35.175
...you'd still be on layaway.

01:37.860 --> 01:40.693
Besides, I have a very good feeling
about this.

01:40.940 --> 01:42.817
<i>I'm in the money</i>

01:52.020 --> 01:56.059
- No raise, right, Al?
- That's right, Peg.

01:57.020 --> 02:00.490
And to prove that every dark cloud
has a silver bullet...

02:00.700 --> 02:05.137
...my boss, Gary, put both me
and Griff on commission.

02:05.380 --> 02:06.608
Commission?

02:06.820 --> 02:11.336
So you mean our budget is now just a
percentage of shiny rocks and sticks?

02:11.860 --> 02:14.897
Thanks for that unwavering
vote of confidence, son.

02:15.140 --> 02:18.177
Now, Peg, since you were the one
who badgered me...

02:18.460 --> 02:21.054
...to ask Gary about the raise,
let's hear your ideas...

02:21.260 --> 02:24.058
...to keep the cash flow
coming into the house.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.218
Well, I'll take that under advisement.

02:35.460 --> 02:38.452
But as usual, I have a plan.

02:38.740 --> 02:43.655
Good. Just as long as it's not one of
those stupid midnight-madness sales.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.573
Where the employees dress up
in those ridiculous costumes...

02:46.780 --> 02:49.169
...that have nothing to do
with what they're selling.

02:53.100 --> 02:57.935
Bud, your father would never do
something stupid like that.

02:59.620 --> 03:02.134
So, Al, what's your idea?

03:06.700 --> 03:08.258
I'm not telling you.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.695
Hey, Mom, Bud, listen.

03:16.820 --> 03:19.254
I have been named
student of the month...

03:19.460 --> 03:22.418
...at the Larry Storch
School of Acting.

03:22.820 --> 03:26.130
Honey, I couldn't be
more proud of you.

03:27.180 --> 03:29.375
Who's Larry Storch?

03:29.780 --> 03:33.216
<i>He played Corporal Agarn
on the TV show F Troop.</i>

03:33.860 --> 03:36.852
- Was he the one with the big--?
- No, no, no.

03:37.060 --> 03:38.971
That was Forrest Tucker.

03:39.740 --> 03:42.538
And not only do I win dinner
with Mr. Storch...

03:42.780 --> 03:45.169
...but I get to do a scene
with him on-stage...

03:45.380 --> 03:47.336
...in front
of very important producers.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.775
Larry and I are
gonna be a team, you know...

03:49.980 --> 03:52.210
...like Wally and the Beavis.

03:54.820 --> 03:58.290
Kelly, what producer
worth his cellular phone...

03:58.500 --> 04:01.139
...would give a tinker's damn
about you and Larry Storch?

04:01.380 --> 04:03.052
Larry Storch?

04:08.460 --> 04:10.576
Did I hear somebody say,
"Larry Storch"?

04:10.820 --> 04:12.048
That's right, Daddy.

04:12.260 --> 04:15.935
The Larry Storch
is coming over here for dinner.

04:16.180 --> 04:18.057
Everybody's favorite corporal?

04:18.300 --> 04:21.656
Coming here to
my least favorite place?

04:22.380 --> 04:25.690
Finally the rewards
of a righteous life.

04:28.740 --> 04:32.972
What is the big fuss
about this Corporal Egg-Roll guy?

04:33.260 --> 04:36.809
Corporal Agarn,
you blasphemous heathen.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.296
You don't understand
the genius of the man.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.776
<i>In F Troop, when one of the idiots
in his regiment would make him mad...</i>

04:42.980 --> 04:45.653
...he'd go walking over to him
like only he could walk...

04:45.860 --> 04:48.090
...and give him a whack
on the head with his hat.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.530
You just don't see that anymore.

04:50.780 --> 04:53.658
There's a lot of things
I don't see anymore.

04:55.900 --> 04:59.734
Especially if they're more than
100 feet from the couch.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.655
- When's he coming?
- Next Tuesday night.

05:04.900 --> 05:09.496
Gadzooks. That's the same time
as my midnight-madness shoe sale.

05:14.820 --> 05:18.051
That's if I was having one.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.651
All right, I'll just make Griff
do everything. Sweetheart...

05:21.860 --> 05:24.772
...I've got to have a picture of Larry
hitting me with his hat.

05:24.980 --> 05:28.495
- Do we have any film?
- Besides the one on your teeth?

05:30.060 --> 05:32.528
If only I had a hat...

05:32.900 --> 05:35.255
...with a big rock in it.

05:45.180 --> 05:48.411
Tell me again what werewolves
have to do with shoes?

05:48.700 --> 05:50.338
Again?

05:51.500 --> 05:53.252
Wolves.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.979
Night.

05:55.860 --> 05:57.578
Moon.

05:58.780 --> 06:00.452
Shoes.

06:04.020 --> 06:07.057
See, wolves are nocturnal.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.091
They hunt at night.

06:09.340 --> 06:12.935
Hence, wolves. Night.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.814
- Moon. Shoes.
- Moon. Shoes.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.098
Now back up, you're about to see...

06:19.300 --> 06:21.734
...the midnight-madness shoe sale
at its ugliest.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.732
And perhaps...

06:24.300 --> 06:26.131
...at its fattest.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.694
You know, if these were real,
I'd rip you to shreds.

06:38.940 --> 06:43.013
Hurry up, Kelly.
Mr. Scorch will be here any minute.

06:43.260 --> 06:44.978
Oh, Mom.

06:50.460 --> 06:53.372
I am so excited.
I mean, just imagine...

06:53.820 --> 06:56.892
...me and Larry Storch
on the stage together.

06:57.140 --> 07:00.928
Tonight, I become a lesbian.

07:05.620 --> 07:08.293
I think you mean a "thespian," dear.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.128
Yeah, well, the reviews aren't in yet.

07:12.380 --> 07:16.089
So how do I look?

07:21.060 --> 07:25.611
Like a limited-edition,
condom-packing Barbie.

07:32.340 --> 07:36.174
Bud, you look nice.
Hey, by the way, can you say:

07:36.420 --> 07:38.615
"You'll never get me, Batman."

07:44.060 --> 07:47.530
Hey, kids, stop it. No fighting.

07:47.780 --> 07:49.577
That's what your father is for.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.650
Mom, I'm just trying
to make her understand...

07:52.860 --> 07:56.375
...that this whole Larry Storch
School of Acting thing is a fraud.

07:56.620 --> 07:59.453
Just like the Larry Storch
School of Karate.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.416
Or the Larry Storch School of Heating
and Air Conditioning Repair.

08:03.860 --> 08:05.612
Larry Storch is not a fraud.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.693
Now, before I started
his acting school, I was untrained...

08:08.940 --> 08:13.013
...I was undisciplined,
I was un- a bunch of things.

08:14.980 --> 08:18.814
But since I've been studying
at his wise and wonderful feet...

08:19.060 --> 08:22.769
...I now can soar with the beagles.

08:24.980 --> 08:30.452
I am a moth
and Larry Storch is my flame.

08:35.299 --> 08:39.578
You know, she's one small step
from selling Watchtower.

08:43.740 --> 08:47.289
There's your father
and his Dodge.

08:47.580 --> 08:51.539
No, that's Larry Storch
and his Dodge.

08:54.140 --> 08:56.973
Now, listen, Bud, tonight
is very, very important to me.

08:57.220 --> 09:01.133
Just try to treat him with the respect
a man of his stature deserves, okay?

09:03.460 --> 09:04.813
Hi.

09:10.860 --> 09:16.298
Anybody wanna buy a Dodge?
One owner, one gear, $1.

09:17.780 --> 09:19.498
One bullet.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.531
Hi, Mr. Storch.
I'd like to introduce you...

09:23.740 --> 09:26.698
...to my lovely family,
but we'll just go with what's here.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.697
- This is my mom, Peggy.
- How do you do?

09:28.900 --> 09:33.098
<i>How do you do, Mr. Storch.
I just loved you in D Cup.</i>

09:34.660 --> 09:37.777
<i>That's F Troop.</i>

09:38.180 --> 09:41.536
- And this is our dog, Buck, over here.
- Charming.

09:41.780 --> 09:44.135
- There's our favorite clock.
- Look at that.

09:44.380 --> 09:47.850
And here's the hat my dad bought so
you could hit him over the head with it.

09:48.060 --> 09:50.733
And here's our favorite can opener--

09:50.980 --> 09:52.333
And there's my brother, Bud.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.535
The kid with the rubber woman.

09:57.420 --> 10:00.571
Kelly did a brilliant,
brilliant monologue in class...

10:00.820 --> 10:05.416
...depicting your sad, pathetic life.
I laughed, I cried.

10:05.660 --> 10:08.254
And now that I meet you,
I'm laughing again.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.852
Well, if I could just borrow some
jumper cables, why, we can...

10:12.060 --> 10:14.494
- ...get this show on the road.
- Not just yet.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.851
You see, my husband really wants
to meet you and he's still at work.

10:18.060 --> 10:20.210
- He's a huge fan of yours.
- Really?

10:20.460 --> 10:23.975
In his defense,
he's also a shoe salesman.

10:26.540 --> 10:29.612
So when's the old shoe-slinger
coming home?

10:29.860 --> 10:32.249
Well, you see,
he's having this madness sale.

10:32.500 --> 10:36.015
You know: wolf, night, moon, moron.

10:36.260 --> 10:40.094
He's probably just in
a selling frenzy right now.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.777
I'll get it.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.697
I ate a fly.

10:59.140 --> 11:00.937
Well, deal with it.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.896
- Hello?
- Al, it's me.

11:04.100 --> 11:07.536
<i>Larry from G Spot is here.</i>

11:14.420 --> 11:16.490
Great, Peg. Keep him there.

11:16.740 --> 11:20.016
Well, all right. But, honey, hurry.
And on your way home...

11:20.220 --> 11:22.893
...do you think you could pick me up
some of those little--

11:24.860 --> 11:27.772
Griff, the Agarn has landed.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.295
- I gotta get home.
- But what if we get a customer?

11:30.540 --> 11:34.852
Don't be silly. Who's gonna come in
here? We're dressed like wolves.

11:35.140 --> 11:37.859
No one is gonna stop me
from meeting my TV hero.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.170
Al, Gary.

11:40.420 --> 11:42.729
Gary's not gonna keep me
from meeting him either.

11:42.980 --> 11:45.574
You know what your trouble is?
You're afraid of the boss.

11:45.780 --> 11:49.011
Yeah. Just because
Gary's built like a man...

11:50.020 --> 11:54.696
...doesn't mean she can hit like one.
Let her come in here and sell shoes.

11:55.060 --> 11:58.894
I'm out of here!

12:05.220 --> 12:07.609
Please don't fire me.

12:18.580 --> 12:22.050
Mr. Storch, that was Al. Something's
come up at the shoe store...

12:22.260 --> 12:24.251
...and he wants us
to bring you down there.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.138
Wait. But, Mom, we gotta rehearse.

12:26.340 --> 12:29.332
<i>After dinner, we're doing our big scene
from Phantom of the Opera.</i>

12:29.540 --> 12:35.410
Kelly, the very first rule of acting:
Never disappoint your public.

12:35.660 --> 12:37.730
No, actually,
that's the second rule of acting.

12:37.940 --> 12:41.569
<i>The first rule is never have
the chile relleno before you do Hamlet.</i>

12:42.780 --> 12:44.896
Well, where's Al working?

12:45.140 --> 12:47.779
Maybe we can just stop by
and see him before dinner.

12:48.020 --> 12:51.569
No. Then he'll want to eat with us.
I know what we'll do.

12:51.780 --> 12:54.931
We'll all go out to dinner, then Bud
will take you down to meet Al...

12:55.140 --> 12:57.256
...and Kelly and I
will go on to the theater.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.853
Gee, thanks, Ma.

12:59.100 --> 13:02.809
Can I pick you up a nice big box
of panty shields while I'm out?

13:04.100 --> 13:07.934
- Now that you mention it, I actually--
- Kelly, to get to the theater...

13:08.180 --> 13:11.775
...you must first go through
the Larry Storch School of Acting...

13:12.020 --> 13:17.856
...and then you must proceed to
the Larry Storch Performing Art Center.

13:19.580 --> 13:24.654
So you mean crawl through the vent
into the old movie house next door?

13:25.140 --> 13:27.017
Bingo.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.179
Isn't this exciting?
And I thought the theater was dead.

13:30.420 --> 13:33.457
No, no. It just smells that way.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.210
But you'll get used to it.

13:39.860 --> 13:43.773
So this is really today's take?

13:44.180 --> 13:47.138
Actually, ma'am,
that's yesterday's take.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.812
We were gonna bring it to the bank, but
they have a 50-cent minimum deposit.

13:52.340 --> 13:55.059
Luckily we haven't taken
our commission out yet.

13:57.460 --> 14:00.816
Which, of course, we're going to plow
right back into the business.

14:01.060 --> 14:06.054
I did not amass my considerable
personal fortune by giving up.

14:06.300 --> 14:09.849
I am determined to turn this place
around and I'll tell you why.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.056
Years ago,
in my first business venture...

14:12.300 --> 14:15.133
...I went with what I thought
was a sure thing.

14:15.380 --> 14:19.658
But it turned out that my partner
was a shyster. I lost my shirt.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.892
- You still had your bra, didn't you?
- Shut up.

14:24.980 --> 14:27.972
From that day forward,
I vowed two things:

14:28.220 --> 14:31.974
One: That I would never again
have a failing business venture.

14:32.220 --> 14:36.816
And two: I would exact my revenge
from the guy that ripped me off.

14:37.060 --> 14:38.334
What kind of business was it?

14:40.180 --> 14:44.298
The Larry Storch School of Heating
and Air Conditioning Repair.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.810
Larry Storch is in the house.

14:49.340 --> 14:51.092
Hit the deck.

15:00.780 --> 15:04.819
This is great. This is great.
What are we gonna do now?

15:05.060 --> 15:08.370
Don't worry about it. Give him to me.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.372
Bring him over here.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.570
What are we gonna do?
Give him mouth-to-mouth?

15:13.780 --> 15:16.248
No, no, no. You are.

15:17.540 --> 15:20.691
But first, take our picture.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.216
Come on, Dad.
Forget about Larry Storch.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.934
This is Kelly's big night.
She's waiting at the theater.

15:26.180 --> 15:27.738
You gotta do the right thing, Dad.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.976
And I intend to.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.091
What right thing?

15:44.860 --> 15:48.375
- So glad you could join us.
- We're thrilled to be here.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.936
Yeah. Wild horses
couldn't have dragged us away.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.536
I'd be happy if one kicked me
in the head right about now.

15:58.580 --> 16:02.619
Well, it's about time you showed up.
Hey, where's Larry?

16:03.380 --> 16:05.018
Well, he's in his dressing room.

16:05.260 --> 16:07.216
- You just go get ready, all right?
- Okay.

16:07.460 --> 16:13.092
I am so excited. Today, Chicago.
Tomorrow, Saturday.

16:16.900 --> 16:20.939
Bud, what took you so long
at the shoe store?

16:21.180 --> 16:24.172
Nothing, nothing. Everything's fine.

16:24.580 --> 16:27.048
You did leave the car running,
didn't you?

16:31.380 --> 16:34.531
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Larry Storch Players present...</i>

16:34.780 --> 16:39.854
<i>...A Larry Storch production of
Larry Storch's Phantom of the Opera...</i>

16:40.100 --> 16:42.489
<i>...coming to you in Surround Storch.</i>

16:42.740 --> 16:48.133
<i>Starring Larry Storch and his student
of the month, Ms. Kelly Bundy.</i>

16:57.020 --> 16:58.499
Thanks.

16:59.660 --> 17:03.175
Of all the opera joints
in all the world...

17:03.420 --> 17:06.651
...he had to walk into mine.

17:09.859 --> 17:15.252
I care not that his face
stoppeth a clocketh.

17:16.540 --> 17:22.455
'Tis the heart that beats beneath
the face that I desire to see.

17:22.700 --> 17:26.056
I would not forsake you,
O my ghostly one.

17:26.300 --> 17:31.215
I shall search for the E.

17:33.740 --> 17:36.698
That's "thee," you idiot.

17:39.220 --> 17:44.613
I shall search for thee, you idiot.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.056
Well, I think I'll go get
some refreshments.

17:52.260 --> 17:57.175
You will stay here and you will like it.
Now, Larry's about to come on.

18:12.780 --> 18:18.013
If only I wasn't
hideously disfigured.

18:23.620 --> 18:28.216
I can't believe Christine
could love me.

18:31.100 --> 18:36.254
I'll just sit here
and play with my organ.

18:42.540 --> 18:44.292
This one.

18:48.060 --> 18:52.099
Is it me, or has Larry turned
into a beaten-down...

18:52.300 --> 18:54.609
...defeated old man?

18:55.380 --> 18:57.940
Now, that is the power
of a great actor.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.933
You can almost smell his plight.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.456
Smells like feet.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.732
Larry.

19:13.060 --> 19:16.496
Larry, you're supposed to play here.

19:29.580 --> 19:32.094
Charge!

19:44.060 --> 19:48.576
There he is. I shall now unmask him.

19:52.780 --> 19:57.331
Verily, I would love
to show you my face, but I cannot.

19:59.060 --> 20:01.813
I haveth a headache.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.417
But, Phantom, I must unmask you.

20:05.660 --> 20:09.938
It doth further our love
and my career.

20:10.340 --> 20:14.219
So oose-lay the asketh-may.

20:15.660 --> 20:19.050
No can doeth-ay.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.531
- Come on. Give me the mask.
- No, I say.

20:23.420 --> 20:25.251
Give me the damn mask.

20:41.420 --> 20:45.459
Tail. Moons. Feet.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.736
Al.

20:48.020 --> 20:51.695
Wait. Mr. Storch.
That's the emergency exit.

20:51.940 --> 20:53.453
No.

20:53.900 --> 20:57.017
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the police will be arriving shortly.</i>

20:57.260 --> 20:59.649
<i>Please exit single file
through the decorative drapes.</i>

20:59.900 --> 21:03.529
<i>We hope you enjoyed
your theater experience.</i>

21:05.620 --> 21:08.180
Well, Daddy, it was really nice of you
to try to help me.

21:08.420 --> 21:12.015
I mean, it would have been nicer
if you had succeeded...

21:12.780 --> 21:15.010
...but at least it shows you care.

21:15.620 --> 21:18.180
Well, you're not mad at me
because I screwed up?

21:18.460 --> 21:21.611
Not really. Mom and Bud
probably are...

21:21.820 --> 21:25.699
...because you wouldn't front them
the 35 bucks to spring them from jail.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.896
And Larry Storch probably is,
because he got knocked out.

21:30.140 --> 21:31.812
And the D'Arcys probably are, but--

21:32.060 --> 21:35.450
Pumpkin, enough with
the pep talk, now.

21:36.140 --> 21:38.893
You know who I really feel bad for,
though, is Griff.

21:39.140 --> 21:45.010
I'd go down there and help him out,
but it's late and I'm dodging an APB.

21:48.060 --> 21:50.255
That's right. Step right up.

21:50.500 --> 21:55.051
Have your picture taken
with TV legend Larry Storch.

21:56.300 --> 21:59.929
Larry Storch was always my favorite.

22:00.180 --> 22:04.651
Every day I watched and hoped
he'd get off the island.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.452
I was a big fan.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.691
Who wasn't?

22:18.460 --> 22:21.020
All right, everybody smile.
