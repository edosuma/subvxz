00:01.800 --> 00:03.768
***

00:16.150 --> 00:17.742
- Lemme guess,
you're minutes away.

00:17.780 --> 00:20.248
- Uh, yeah, I'm
trying. Uh, but...

00:20.280 --> 00:22.339
the traffic in this city
gets worse every day.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.608
Hey, buddy! This
ain't a parking lot!

00:24.650 --> 00:26.459
- Shade. I called you
on your house phone.

00:26.490 --> 00:29.129
- Oh.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.197
fifteen minutes ago.

00:32.230 --> 00:35.222
I'll see you soon.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.763
- That was pathetic.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.360
- Everyone's a critic.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.836
- For pete's sake! Yeah,
I told you, I'm on my way--

00:43.870 --> 00:47.306
Oh, sorry. Yeah,
this is Mr. Shade.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.843
Dr. Plummer?
What test results?

00:49.880 --> 00:53.611
- That's for me.

00:53.650 --> 00:55.618
Aren't you late?
You should haul butt, huh?

00:55.650 --> 00:58.847
- Yeah.

00:58.890 --> 01:01.779
- Yeah, hi, this is,
uh... Don Shade.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.222
- Look at it, it's magnificent.
You ever been inside?

01:11.270 --> 01:14.592
- Last year, for a concert.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.767
- As in Arcade Fire.
- Ah!

01:16.810 --> 01:18.732
- Closest I ever got

01:18.770 --> 01:21.307
to classical music was
dating an oboe player.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.740
Talk about a
great set of lungs.

01:23.780 --> 01:25.543
: Now you just
blow your own horn.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.465
***

02:18.500 --> 02:20.730
- Antoine Tremblay.
- Angie Everett.

02:20.770 --> 02:23.204
This is my partner,
Matt Shade.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.333
- Wunderkind conductor
of the Ontario Symphony!

02:25.370 --> 02:27.770
I've read all about you!
- We can't believe

02:27.810 --> 02:30.574
everything we read. Or see.

02:30.610 --> 02:32.817
Which is why I called you.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.413
- I need you

02:38.450 --> 02:40.884
to find my fiance,
Laura Caspary.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.184
She's the love
of my life.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.482
- Have you filed a missing
persons' report with the police?

02:45.530 --> 02:47.657
- No point. They
won't listen to me.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.788
- Because Laura has
been dead for a year.

02:54.970 --> 02:58.667
- ** I see you and you see me

02:58.710 --> 03:02.874
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're makin' a scene *

03:02.910 --> 03:06.516
* Oh boy, you've got to know

03:06.550 --> 03:08.677
* What my head overlooks

03:08.720 --> 03:12.508
* The senses will show
to my heart *

03:12.560 --> 03:17.452
* When it's watching for lies
'cause you can't escape my *

03:17.490 --> 03:20.391
- * Private Eyes
They're watching you *

03:20.430 --> 03:23.763
* Private Eyes

03:23.800 --> 03:25.768
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

03:25.800 --> 03:28.337
* Watching you *

03:29.840 --> 03:32.604
***

03:32.640 --> 03:34.528
- I met Laura when
she came to the orchestra.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.798
She played first violin.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.375
In the beginning, we tried
to deny our feelings.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.809
Office romances
can be difficult.

03:41.850 --> 03:45.445
But, um...
we fell in love.

03:45.490 --> 03:48.288
- And got engaged.
- The last night I saw her,

03:48.320 --> 03:49.924
we went to our favorite
restaurant. I got

03:49.960 --> 03:51.985
an emergency call.
I had to come back

03:52.030 --> 03:54.351
to fill in for the Pops
conductor, who was sick.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.722
- I never saw her again.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.567
Next day, I get
a call from the police.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.433
They said she went sailing.
Her boat was found

04:02.470 --> 04:05.462
washed up on shore.
I couldn't believe it.

04:05.510 --> 04:07.774
- I can understand that.
- No, I mean, Laura would not

04:07.810 --> 04:10.347
have gone sailing
by herself. At night?

04:10.380 --> 04:12.814
During a storm?
That's crazy!

04:12.850 --> 04:14.909
- I remember hearing about this
in the news. The police said--

04:14.950 --> 04:17.783
- I don't care! They
never found her body.

04:17.820 --> 04:21.415
- But it's been a year.
- I never stopped hoping.

04:21.460 --> 04:24.054
And then, yesterday,
it happened.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.490
I saw her.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.492
- I was looking out my office
window, when I saw her

04:31.530 --> 04:32.599
cross the street.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.959
- For a second,
I couldn't

04:34.000 --> 04:36.639
believe my eyes.
So I took a picture.

04:36.670 --> 04:39.537
By the time I got
to the sidewalk,

04:39.580 --> 04:42.572
she disappeared.
But... look...

04:42.610 --> 04:46.444
- That's her blue
scarf. I know it.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.448
That's not a ghost.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.448
That's Laura!

04:55.620 --> 04:58.885
- Poor guy. It's enough

04:58.930 --> 05:01.854
to break your heart.
- You think he's
imagining things?

05:01.900 --> 05:05.427
- No! I think he truly believes
that he saw his fiance.

05:05.470 --> 05:07.438
- His dead fiance.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.938
- There is that.

05:09.970 --> 05:12.734
- Those headlights
behind us have been
there for a while now.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.409
- You think we're
being followed?

05:16.450 --> 05:18.600
- Aw, forget it. All
this talk about ghosts

05:18.650 --> 05:20.914
has just got
my nerves on edge.

05:20.950 --> 05:23.487
You know, it's probably no
coincidence that Antoine's

05:23.520 --> 05:25.988
sighted Laura right around
the one-year anniversary

05:26.020 --> 05:28.056
of her death.
- Yeah.

05:28.090 --> 05:30.479
Sometimes you want something
so bad, you just can't believe

05:30.530 --> 05:32.725
it's not there.
- Yeah.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.955
- Wouldn't hurt to talk
to the police, though.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.922
Get the ofﬁcial download. I'll
tell Maz to put the coffee on.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.462
_ _ Homicide __
Investigates all fatalities,

05:40.500 --> 05:43.139
even accidents.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.638
But you already knew
that. Unless, of course,

05:45.670 --> 05:48.002
there's some_ reason--
- There isn't!

05:48.040 --> 05:50.702
- Have you guys even seen each
other since--
- No.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.913
- But things aren't--

05:53.950 --> 05:56.009
- Your word.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.644
Nolan and I are
both adults. In fact,

05:58.690 --> 06:01.853
it'll be good to see him again.
- Sing it, sister!

06:01.890 --> 06:03.983
***

06:16.940 --> 06:20.637
- Angie.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.898
- Depends what you have in mind.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.976
- Of course, you're...
working a case.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.615
- Sort of. If you've
got a minute...

06:28.650 --> 06:31.813
- We can go to someone else.

06:34.790 --> 06:37.520
- Laura Caspary. She went out
sailing about a year ago.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.028
- And never came back.

06:40.060 --> 06:42.096
- Yeah, it was a high profile
case. My team handled

06:42.130 --> 06:44.064
the investigation.
Who's your client?

06:44.100 --> 06:46.193
- Antoine Tremblay.
Laura's fianc.

06:46.230 --> 06:49.438
- And Antoine wants you to...
- Find Laura.

06:49.470 --> 06:52.200
- No. Her!

06:52.240 --> 06:56.074
- He claims he saw her
yesterday. Alive.

06:56.110 --> 06:58.749
- And you're taking
this man's money?
- We just wanted to know

06:58.780 --> 07:00.975
if there was any way th--
- No. No way.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.989
Laura Caspary took her sailboat
out alone and a storm hit.

07:04.020 --> 07:06.557
Few days later, her boat
washed up on the rocks,

07:06.590 --> 07:09.115
broken, bloodstained,
just outside of Cobourg.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.152
Coroner's official report was
that she got hit by the boom

07:12.190 --> 07:16.024
and fell overboard.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.221
- Not unusual. It's a big lake.
- Had Laura ever gone out

07:18.270 --> 07:21.489
sailing alone before?
At night

07:21.540 --> 07:23.804
- Doesn't matter,
she did, that night.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.161
- The best thing you can do

07:26.210 --> 07:28.098
for your client is tell him
to move on with his life,

07:28.140 --> 07:31.109
OK? Not every love story

07:31.150 --> 07:34.677
has a happy ending.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.541
***

07:40.520 --> 07:43.489
- Yeah, never better.

07:43.530 --> 07:46.658
- Listen, if you wanna
talk about it...

07:46.700 --> 07:49.521
- Rain check. I'm gonna...
call it an early night.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.526
We'll hit it fresh
in the morning.

07:51.570 --> 07:53.936
: OK.

07:53.970 --> 07:56.837
***

07:59.940 --> 08:02.238
***

08:06.250 --> 08:08.912
- Goat intestines,
sheep entrails...

08:08.950 --> 08:11.680
Also, donkey membranes.
: On second thought...

08:11.720 --> 08:13.950
- And then they stretch them
and twist them into strings

08:13.990 --> 08:17.221
for instruments.
- Which brings us to violins.

08:17.260 --> 08:20.093
- And Laura. OK,
now I understand.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.894
- Sorry. Wikipedia is
like Satan's candy for me.

08:22.930 --> 08:25.728
Aanay, Laura's Ameechee
page went dark the day

08:25.770 --> 08:27.294
she disappeared. Ditto on
the credit cards, cell phone,

08:27.340 --> 08:30.605
yada yada.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.779
- Her mother is alive, but
currently has a front row seat

08:32.810 --> 08:35.608
in God's waiting room.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.768
The Sunland Rest Home.
- Oh.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.914
- From her old posts,
the only buds Laura had were

08:40.950 --> 08:43.714
fellow musicians, and
nobody else has come forward.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.651
- Except our client. And as much
as it pains me to admit it,

08:46.690 --> 08:49.158
I think Nolan may be
right; it is kinda cruel

08:49.190 --> 08:52.057
to give Antoine false hope.
- What about what he said

08:52.090 --> 08:54.297
about her sailing trip? How
she'd never go out at night?

08:54.330 --> 08:56.696
Or into a storm?
- Well, it does sound strange,

08:56.730 --> 08:59.597
I'll admit, but...
the bottom line is,

08:59.640 --> 09:02.165
we don't have any evidence
that this woman is still alive.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.760
- She is.
- What, so now

09:04.810 --> 09:06.778
you're sipping the K00!
- Not Laura.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.971
- This woman. Look,
she's not even walking.

09:09.010 --> 09:11.308
She's actually stopped
on the sidewalk. Almost as if

09:11.350 --> 09:13.818
she's looking over
at the concert hall.

09:13.850 --> 09:16.273
- Maybe she's lost.
- Or a tourist.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.187
- Or maybe she knows
someone in the building...

09:19.220 --> 09:22.280
or in the orchestra._
Someone who could identify her.

09:24.360 --> 09:28.251
- No. I mean, maybe.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.768
- No, maybe she does look a
little like Laura. But, honey,

09:30.800 --> 09:32.961
put me in a red wig and
sunglasses and so would I.

09:37.170 --> 09:39.638
- Not a toy.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.171
- Just that they
were in love.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.043
Everyone could see it
before they did.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.742
- This photograph was taken
yesterday, just outside.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.985
Do you recognize this woman?

09:53.020 --> 09:55.386
- You think she
looks like Laura?

09:55.420 --> 09:57.888
- Yes, actually.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.899
And Laura used to always
wear a blue scarf, but...

10:00.930 --> 10:03.763
obviously that can't be
her. I mean, Laura's dead.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.166
- Thanks.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.397
***

10:09.440 --> 10:12.159
- I remember
that blue scarf.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.974
: That poor, dear man.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.944
- They say time
heals all wounds,

10:16.980 --> 10:19.949
but don't you believe
them. In fact, I heard...

10:19.980 --> 10:23.882
I probably shouldn't...
- Oh, it's... just us girls.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.855
-_ Rumour has it he's still
paying rent on her apartment.

10:26.890 --> 10:29.085
- It's like he's keeping

10:29.120 --> 10:31.987
a shrine
to a dead woman.

10:32.030 --> 10:34.954
Isn't it romantic?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.719
***

10:37.770 --> 10:40.091
(nicely played
soon

11:03.190 --> 11:05.954
- That's beautiful.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.094
- Chopin's Nocturne
in E flat.

11:08.130 --> 11:12.328
Laura's favorite.
- Antome, we're sorry, we--

11:12.370 --> 11:14.895
- ...haven't found anything
to prove that Laura's alive.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.966
- I know what I saw.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.729
Who I saw.
- I know you want it to be true.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.874
- Have you never
met someone...

11:23.910 --> 11:26.299
someone so special
you knew it was...

11:26.350 --> 11:29.376
I don't know,
fate... destiny?

11:32.050 --> 11:34.189
Call it whatever you want,
but Laura and I

11:34.220 --> 11:36.381
had something magical.
- We understand--

11:36.420 --> 11:38.183
- No, you don't!
And nothing you say

11:38.230 --> 11:40.994
will convince me
that she's gone.

11:41.030 --> 11:42.429
- Is that why you're paying
the rent on her old apartment?

11:46.800 --> 11:50.736
- I guess that's my way
of keeping her alive.

11:50.770 --> 11:54.774
After the funeral,
I locked up her place...

11:54.810 --> 11:57.802
haven't been inside since then.
- Even yesterday,

11:57.850 --> 12:00.512
after you saw
the woman on the street?

12:00.550 --> 12:03.348
- I drove over
to Laura's apartment,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.881
but... I couldn't
bring myself to go in.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.219
I sat parked outside,
all day and night. Hoping,

12:09.260 --> 12:12.354
praying she would
come back.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.324
- What if we go
back to her apartment,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.828
and... go inside with you?

12:16.870 --> 12:20.533
- If she's alive
and... came back,

12:20.570 --> 12:24.199
there'll be signs.
And if not...

12:24.240 --> 12:26.834
maybe it's time you let her go.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.245
***

12:46.560 --> 12:50.963
- Excuse me. Have you ever seen
anyone from this apartment?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.230
- Oh, only been here a couple
of months. But no, I guess

12:53.270 --> 12:55.864
I always assumed it was empty.
It's a great building.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.504
Are you movin' in?
- Just checking on a friend.

12:57.540 --> 13:00.532
Thanks.

13:03.380 --> 13:06.201
- It's now or never.

13:20.530 --> 13:23.863
- She hasn't been here.
No one's been here.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.266
It's just as I
left it a year ago.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.461
- We're sorry
Antoine.

13:35.140 --> 13:39.543
_ -_I've been a fool.
Believmg in some fantasy...

13:39.580 --> 13:43.949
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

13:43.990 --> 13:47.380
- She loved her
record collection.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.581
- The top is open.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.896
- Well, there's dust
and fingerprints on top,

13:52.930 --> 13:56.297
but the platter inside is clean.
- There's no dust...

13:56.330 --> 13:59.219
This turntable's been opened
within the last day or so.

13:59.270 --> 14:01.568
- It's gone!

14:01.600 --> 14:06.503
- Laura's favorite record.
Chopin's Nocturne in E flat!

14:06.540 --> 14:08.428
She always kept it
on the turntable.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.949
The cover's gone, too.
She was here!

14:13.980 --> 14:16.278
- Whoa, slow down...
- Antoine...

14:16.320 --> 14:17.981
- Laura is alive!

14:21.460 --> 14:23.485
***

14:28.600 --> 14:30.625
- Laura was here.
She had to be.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.468
- Let's not jump to conclusions.
- But no one else has a key.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.333
- They wouldn't need one.
The lock on the apartment door

14:36.370 --> 14:38.964
is a 1980's, two tumbler model.
Anyone with a credit card

14:39.010 --> 14:41.171
could crack it.

14:41.210 --> 14:43.201
- Someone... could be
playing a joke on you.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.548
- No one I_know would
do something so cruel.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.413
- People do some strange things.

14:48.450 --> 14:50.941
- Even now, you don't
think she's alive.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.914
Why don't I
just write you

14:53.960 --> 14:56.611
a cheque, and we forget
everything? I'll find

14:56.660 --> 14:59.151
someone else who'll believe me.
- It's not_ that we don't
believe you.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.249
- There's belief...
then there's proof.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.996
- So what are you
waiting for? Go find it.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.592
***

15:10.670 --> 15:13.207
- You know, maybe he's right.
Maybe we haven't fully committed

15:13.240 --> 15:16.107
to the case. I mean, sure, the
circumstances surrounding
Laura's disappearance

15:16.140 --> 15:18.176
are a bit hinky,
but if she didn't die

15:18.210 --> 15:21.338
in that sailing accident...
then where is she?

15:25.190 --> 15:28.182
I think I'll put a chocolate
fountain in the office.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.257
Maybe take up pole dancing...

15:31.290 --> 15:33.622
shave my head...
- Uh huh...

15:36.500 --> 15:39.663
No, I... swear to God

15:39.700 --> 15:42.339
we're being followed again.

15:42.370 --> 15:44.065
- Speed up!
- I did.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.601
- So slow down.
- I did. But they're
still behind us.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.200
Hang on.

15:53.050 --> 15:56.076
It's nothing.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.008
***

16:18.740 --> 16:21.538
- Hey! Just, uh...
taking care of business.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.548
What have you got there?
- Sal's special

16:23.580 --> 16:25.343
deep-dish meat-lovers.
- Ah, nice!

16:25.380 --> 16:28.110
Does it come
with a defibrillator?

16:28.150 --> 16:29.549
: No, but it comes
with an ice-cold six-pack

16:29.580 --> 16:32.583
and some big screen hockey.
- Thanks, Matt.

16:32.620 --> 16:35.054
But, uh, I think I'm
gonna take a pass tonight.

16:35.090 --> 16:37.786
- OK, fine, no hockey. How about
Dancing With The Stars?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.754
Your favourite arthritic soap
star with the bad nose job

16:40.800 --> 16:43.360
is in the finals.
- As tempting as that may be,

16:43.400 --> 16:45.789
I think I'm gonna
turn in early.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.390
- Yeah, yeah. Just, uh...

16:48.440 --> 16:51.034
I got a few stomach cramps.

16:51.070 --> 16:53.675
Nothing that a Pepto Bismol
and good night sleep won't cure.

16:53.710 --> 16:55.530
Good night, Son.
- Good night, Dad.

16:57.710 --> 17:00.178
***

17:14.760 --> 17:17.593
***

17:22.770 --> 17:26.365
- You're in early.
: Couldn't sleep.

17:26.410 --> 17:29.675
- Yeah.

17:29.710 --> 17:32.838
: I dunno. Dad's
been a little off lately.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.371
A doctor's been
calling the house,

17:35.420 --> 17:38.241
and then, last night, I caught
him getting his estate in order.

17:41.690 --> 17:43.851
When you asked him about it.
- No. No-no-no,

17:43.890 --> 17:46.222
that's not how things work
in the Shade household.

17:46.260 --> 17:49.650
Besides, he just
woulda lied about it.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.793
- "Suck it up, buttercup."
Just like he used to be

17:51.830 --> 17:53.832
back on the ice.
Take a high stick

17:53.870 --> 17:56.464
in the face, come up smiling.
- Wow...

17:56.500 --> 18:00.470
men really are from Mars.
- Yeah. 'Cause Mars is cool.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.348
- You know, after my dad
died, the only things

18:06.380 --> 18:08.314
I regretted were
the things I didn't say.

18:08.350 --> 18:12.081
- Duly noted.
: Got it!

18:15.560 --> 18:17.824
- I had Antoine send
over a high-res copy

18:17.860 --> 18:20.158
of the photo he took. Figured
we could take one more look

18:20.200 --> 18:22.794
at our mystery woman.

18:22.830 --> 18:25.890
- Pierced ear, mole, birthmark.
- Anything that could ID her.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.636
- Good idea. Prove she's
not Laura, and maybe give

18:27.670 --> 18:30.309
our heartbroken
client some peace.

18:30.340 --> 18:33.434
- Everett, you sly dog. Turns
out you are a romantic at heart.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.129
- Tell anyone and
I'll have to kill you.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.705
- Alright, zoom in.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.709
- That's weird.
Always works on CSI.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.684
- Zoom back out.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.211
Wait, look.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.354
A taxi.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.148
- Antoine said by the time
he got down to the street,

18:53.200 --> 18:55.418
the woman had disappeared.

18:55.460 --> 18:58.520
What if our ghost
just hailed a cab?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.409
Thank you.

19:05.740 --> 19:08.231
- Well, that looked promising.
- He remembers the woman.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.248
Said she was nervous.
- Don't suppose she used

19:10.280 --> 19:12.441
a credit card?
- Cash. But get this:

19:12.480 --> 19:14.948
he says he drove her
to the Sunland Rest Home.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.540
- Wait a minute,
that's the same rest
home where Laura's mother is.

19:17.590 --> 19:21.356
- You have been
paying attention.

19:21.390 --> 19:23.381
- You say you're
old friends of Laura's?

19:23.430 --> 19:26.558
- Yes, we know
her from school.

19:26.590 --> 19:30.629
- Even as a young child,
she was so talented.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.319
Shame you weren't
here yesterday.

19:32.370 --> 19:34.588
- You would have seen her.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.666
- Laura! She was here.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.634
We could have all
had tea together. I love

19:40.680 --> 19:43.604
to hear young people talk.
- Mrs. Caspary--

19:43.650 --> 19:45.777
- Martha, please!
- Martha,

19:45.810 --> 19:48.608
are you sure Laura
was here yesterday?

19:48.650 --> 19:50.538
- Why yes, of course!
She was even wearing

19:50.590 --> 19:54.458
the blue scarf
I got her for Christmas.

19:54.490 --> 19:58.381
- Hello, Martha!
Time for your medication.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.898
- Laura, look who's here.

20:00.930 --> 20:04.764
Some old friends of yours.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.939
- And congestive heart failure.

20:10.970 --> 20:12.904
I'm afraid she doesn't
have much time left.

20:12.940 --> 20:15.477
- And she didn't have
any visitors yesterday?

20:15.510 --> 20:17.978
- All visitors sign in
at the front desk.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.978
I would've been called.
- Alright, well, thank you.

20:20.010 --> 20:23.639
- Thanks.

20:23.690 --> 20:27.319
(Chopin's Nocturne
in E flat playing)

20:31.730 --> 20:34.619
Do you mind?

20:36.400 --> 20:37.958
- Martha,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.935
where did you get this?
- It was a gift.

20:40.970 --> 20:44.007
- From Laura. She brought it

20:44.040 --> 20:47.931
with her yesterday.
Such a thoughtful daughter.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.440
- Really appreciate you
bending the rules... Gerald.

20:55.480 --> 20:59.439
- Please; Gerry. You in
the mood for something spicy?

21:01.860 --> 21:04.579
Real "mesquite flavoured". Huh?

21:04.630 --> 21:07.599
- Tempting, but no thanks.
- Yeah.

21:07.630 --> 21:09.518
- Wonder what
"mequIte" is, anyway.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.494
- The nurse was right;
no visitors yesterday.

21:11.530 --> 21:13.839
- Still more nothing.

21:13.870 --> 21:16.338
- The cabbie said he dropped her
off around 2pm. Scroll faster.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.800
- Uh, rear exit.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.842
Gotta keep an eye on the old
birds in case they try

21:23.880 --> 21:27.338
and fly away.
Here, that's, uh...

21:27.380 --> 21:29.371
yesterday.
***

21:31.050 --> 21:34.349
What's... dextrose?

21:34.390 --> 21:36.756
- He was that serial killer

21:36.790 --> 21:39.520
who killed all
the other serial killers.

21:39.560 --> 21:44.429
- You guys sure you're with
the National Security Agency?

21:44.470 --> 21:48.292
- Wait, stop.
- Oh my God.

21:50.970 --> 21:53.609
- It is Laura.

21:55.610 --> 21:57.475
- Looks like our ghost is real.

22:00.980 --> 22:04.609
***

22:04.650 --> 22:06.584
- What, she looks
a bit like Laura.

22:06.620 --> 22:09.350
So do a thousand other women.

22:09.390 --> 22:11.483
- Why would someone
who's not Laura,

22:11.530 --> 22:13.725
but looks like Laura,
go see Laura's mother

22:13.760 --> 22:15.523
in a rest home and bring her
one of Laura's own records!?

22:15.560 --> 22:17.528
- Off the top
of my head...

22:17.570 --> 22:19.526
pensioner scam.

22:19.570 --> 22:22.630
A... woman pretends
to be the daughter of
an Alzheimer's patient,

22:22.670 --> 22:25.901
gets her "mom" to sign
over the life savings.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.737
- But what about the--
- Lemme ask you something.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.408
If Laura is alive,
why hasn't she come forward?

22:31.910 --> 22:35.516
- How closely did you look
into her life

22:35.550 --> 22:37.381
- Very closely.

22:37.420 --> 22:39.809
- But the video! I mean--

22:39.850 --> 22:43.422
- Laura Caspary
is dead. OK?

22:43.460 --> 22:45.724
If you two have any decency
left, you'll stop torturing

22:45.760 --> 22:48.456
your client and
shut it down. Now.

22:48.500 --> 22:51.890
It's not a request.

22:55.670 --> 22:58.537
Some kind of payback

22:58.570 --> 23:00.572
because you two...?
- Don't go there.

23:00.610 --> 23:02.601
- What other explanation
is there? Why else

23:02.640 --> 23:04.847
would he deny the video?
- Nolan was angry,

23:04.880 --> 23:08.418
but not about me -- Us. I'd
swear something about this case

23:08.450 --> 23:11.180
is tweaking him. You know,
you might be right.

23:11.220 --> 23:13.780
- About him screwing up
the initial investigation?

23:13.820 --> 23:16.482
- Yeah, but on the other
hand, he has a point.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.181
- I think I liked it
better when I was right.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.118
- If Laura is alive,
why hasn she come forward?

23:20.160 --> 23:22.526
I mean why fake your own death?
- And hide from everyone,

23:22.560 --> 23:24.721
including Antoine.
- Unless...

23:24.770 --> 23:26.692
- Unless she wanted to get
away from her fianc.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.698
Maybe she wanted
out for good.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.208
- You know, my dad
always used to say

23:31.240 --> 23:34.505
everyone leaves a trail. You
just have to know where to look.

23:34.540 --> 23:37.077
- We have been looking.
- Let's go back to the agency,

23:37.110 --> 23:39.078
revisit the case board.
There's gotta be something

23:39.110 --> 23:41.510
we're missing.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.643
Gotta swing by Shona's
diner and pick up Jules.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.885
- As long as you bring me lunch.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.888
Don't you dare say
you already work with one.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.457
***

23:54.900 --> 23:56.856
Hey, Honey.
- Hey, Dad...

23:56.900 --> 23:59.494
- I'm glad you asked.

23:59.530 --> 24:02.135
It's a "sosh" paper about
the global economic crisis.

24:02.170 --> 24:04.206
Which reminds me;

24:04.240 --> 24:06.458
how 'bout that raise
in my allowance?

24:06.510 --> 24:08.671
- I thought I smelled a setup.
Talk to your mother.

24:08.710 --> 24:10.701
Hey, where's my dad?
- Uh, Shona ran out

24:10.750 --> 24:12.843
of toilet paper and he
volunteered to go get some.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.518
- Ooh, I do not miss
the restaurant business..

24:14.550 --> 24:16.939
- Hey, Matt!
- Hey!

24:16.980 --> 24:19.744
- Uh, yeah. Two jerk chickens

24:19.790 --> 24:22.213
and whatever
you're putting in Don's
lunch to make him shop for you.

24:22.260 --> 24:24.820
: Your dad is not
afraid to get his hands dirty.

24:24.860 --> 24:27.078
- No, he is not.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.257
Hey, uh, he's been spending

24:29.300 --> 24:31.723
a lot of time here,
lately. Have you noticed

24:31.770 --> 24:34.136
anything off about him?
- I don't follow.

24:34.170 --> 24:37.560
- You know, has he mentioned
anything to you about...

24:37.610 --> 24:39.999
how he's doing?
- Family business

24:40.040 --> 24:42.201
is not my business. Something
you want to ask your father,

24:42.240 --> 24:44.174
you should probably ask him
yourself. I'm gonna get

24:44.210 --> 24:45.973
your order.
- Thanks.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.813
(sounds of traffic
and birds chirping)

24:50.850 --> 24:53.648
- It's the timeline

24:53.690 --> 24:56.579
of Laura's final day.
Twelve o'clock,

24:56.620 --> 24:58.986
Laura had a rehearsal at the
orchestra. Three o'clock, gym.

24:59.030 --> 25:02.090
Four o'clock, back to work.
- Until dinner with
Antome at seven.

25:02.130 --> 25:04.564
- (breathing in
deeply): And...

25:04.600 --> 25:06.795
he paid the check with his
credit card, an hour later.

25:06.830 --> 25:08.991
Bit of a stingy
tipper, "B-T-Dubs".

25:09.040 --> 25:11.634
- Then, Antoine gets an
emergency call, he heads back

25:11.670 --> 25:14.036
to work to fill in
for the sick Pops conductor.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.833
- At which point in time
Laura heads down to the marina

25:16.880 --> 25:19.098
to go sailing.
- Even though she's alone,

25:19.150 --> 25:21.744
it's dark... _
- ...and a storm's coming up.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.714
- Doesn't make sense.
- You know what else

25:23.750 --> 25:26.981
doesn't make sense?
Where's her $75,000

25:27.020 --> 25:30.217
Bertold_o violin? It's in_ _
all these pictures. That Violin

25:30.260 --> 25:32.649
was her prized possession.
- It wasn't in her apartment.

25:32.690 --> 25:34.920
I didn't_see it listed_
on the police inventories.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.190
Antoine, maybe?
- I already checked.
He doesn't have it either.

25:37.230 --> 25:39.790
- Why would a woman

25:39.830 --> 25:43.231
be willing to walk away
from her entire life?

25:43.270 --> 25:47.604
Just leave,
everyone, everything?

25:47.640 --> 25:50.575
- Valuable instruments like that
have serial numbers.

25:50.610 --> 25:53.738
For insurance records.
- So if we can't track Laura...

25:53.780 --> 25:57.147
- ...maybe we can
track her violin.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.616
- Thank you for seeing us,
Mr. Belaustro.

26:00.660 --> 26:03.117
- My pleasure.
A good cup of coffee

26:03.160 --> 26:05.219
is like a good violin;

26:05.260 --> 26:07.182
they both
deserve patience,

26:07.230 --> 26:10.222
respect and
a gentle touch.

26:10.260 --> 26:13.263
Sugar?
- Oh, no thank you.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.632
- A purist. I like that.
- I take two lumps.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.763
- So sorry,
only one cup.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.372
- You were saying, about the
violin? The insurance company

26:23.410 --> 26:25.970
said you're the only person
Laura trusted to repair it.

26:26.010 --> 26:28.114
- True. She was
such a nice lady.

26:28.150 --> 26:31.187
So sad what happened to her.
But at least the instrument

26:31.220 --> 26:34.314
stayed within the family.
- Wait a second;

26:34.360 --> 26:37.352
that's Laura's violin?
- Mm-hm.

26:37.390 --> 26:39.881
- And what do you mean it
"stayed within the family"?

26:39.930 --> 26:41.921
- Laura's sister is in town
Vi5iting. A courier

26:41.960 --> 26:44.667
dropped the violin off a couple
of days ago for a minor repair.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.793
- Would you have
the name of that sister?

26:46.830 --> 26:49.298
- Hm!

26:53.110 --> 26:57.001
A Mrs. Heidi Weston,
Salt Spring Island, BC.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.873
Is that who you're looking for?
- And you're sure it's
the same violin?

26:59.910 --> 27:02.845
- Oh, yes. The serial
numbers match perfectly.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.019
Let me get you

27:05.050 --> 27:08.087
some biscotti to go
with that espresso.

27:08.120 --> 27:12.124
- I love biscotti.
And... he doesn't care.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.651
- Laura doesn't have
a sister. That was her!

27:14.700 --> 27:17.669
- Your dad was right.
Everyone leaves a trail.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.861
- Look, she used
Zephyr Courier Services.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.697
I wonder where they picked
the violin up from.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.230
- Well, there's only
one way to find out.

27:23.270 --> 27:25.238
***

27:27.210 --> 27:30.179
- Free HBO

27:30.210 --> 27:32.349
and Magic Fingers beds!

27:32.380 --> 27:34.769
- Heidi Weston.
Room 201.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.970
***

27:39.120 --> 27:41.088
- There's someone
movmg around in there.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.917
- Yeah, we spooked her.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.253
Alright, stand back.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.850
:Oh...

27:54.970 --> 27:57.268
- Hello, Laura.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.776
- You even take
a breath, you're dead.

28:02.810 --> 28:04.949
***

28:09.820 --> 28:11.242
***

28:16.120 --> 28:18.054
- Nolan!
- Angie.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.251
You just couldn't
leave it alone, could you?
- I knew you were lying to us.

28:23.300 --> 28:26.098
- Sergeant Pamela Blake.

28:26.130 --> 28:30.237
- The Feds!
Well, I think

28:30.270 --> 28:33.398
someone owes us
an explanation.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.477
- Last year, Laura
witnessed a murder.

28:36.510 --> 28:40.298
Big mob hit.
The hitman

28:40.350 --> 28:43.114
_ is still _on the loose.
- High profile case and Laura

28:43.150 --> 28:45.289
is our only witness.
- So that's why

28:45.320 --> 28:47.959
she's in_ the witness
protection program.

28:47.990 --> 28:49.958
- It was only supposed
to be for a little while.

28:49.990 --> 28:51.753
- We've been tracking
Dennis Farrow, the hitman

28:51.790 --> 28:54.350
unfortunately
he remains at large.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.119
- You didn't tell
Antoine any of this?

28:57.160 --> 29:00.766
It would have put his
life in jeopardy. Not to mention

29:00.800 --> 29:02.392
destroying his career.
I couldn't do that to him.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.136
- It was safer for everyone

29:05.170 --> 29:08.936
that way. That is
until a couple of days ago,

29:08.980 --> 29:11.801
when I got the call from Nolan.
I heard she'd gone AWOL,

29:11.850 --> 29:14.819
so, I followed her out here.

29:14.850 --> 29:17.341
Why now?

29:17.380 --> 29:19.541
- My mother's dying.

29:19.590 --> 29:23.219
I just wanted to see her
one last time. I even brought

29:23.260 --> 29:26.127
my blue scarf, so
she'd recognize me.
- And the Chopin album.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.799
- And even more dangerous,
you walked right past

29:28.830 --> 29:30.866
the concert hall.
- I never thought Antoine

29:30.900 --> 29:32.822
would look out his window
at that exact moment.

29:32.870 --> 29:35.293
- Must be fate.

29:35.340 --> 29:38.264
***
- Or bad judgment.

29:38.310 --> 29:42.269
You put your own life and this
entire investigation at risk.

29:42.310 --> 29:45.370
- I don't care anymore.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.810
I'm tired

29:47.850 --> 29:49.977
of running.

29:50.020 --> 29:52.147
I just wanted to see
my old life again. I wanted

29:55.360 --> 29:58.352
Is it true Antoine hired you?

30:01.230 --> 30:04.222
How is he?
- He's not great.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.034
He never gave up hoping
that you were alive.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.305
He never stopped
loving you.

30:13.340 --> 30:16.104
- It's been so hard on me,
I just can't imagine

30:16.140 --> 30:20.440
what it's done to him. I mean
I wasn't trying to hurt him.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.119
: I was trying
to protect him.

30:23.150 --> 30:26.415
I love him so much.

30:29.660 --> 30:32.584
- So, now you know,
much more than you ever

30:32.630 --> 30:34.495
needed to.
Case closed.

30:34.530 --> 30:38.489
- Heidi

30:38.530 --> 30:41.067
is gonna be on the
next plane, back to BC.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.103
You're gonna convince Antoine
the woman he saw wasn't Laura.

30:44.140 --> 30:47.029
- And any further interference
in this federal case will result

30:47.070 --> 30:49.573
in charges of obstruction
and subsequent prosecution.

30:49.610 --> 30:51.942
I will see
to that myself.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.504
***

30:55.650 --> 30:57.572
- You heard what
the Sergeant said.

30:57.620 --> 31:00.885
- OK, let's look
at our options.

31:00.920 --> 31:04.048
- Right. Number one, we tell
our client the truth.

31:04.090 --> 31:06.558
- Yeah, like...

31:06.590 --> 31:09.650
Hey, Bud, awesome
news. Laura's alive.

31:09.700 --> 31:12.089
But, Ooh!
Bummer! She's

31:12.130 --> 31:14.064
in the witness
protection program.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.239
- And now we've just put
his life in danger, too.

31:16.270 --> 31:17.908
- Not to mention the part
where we get arrested

31:17.940 --> 31:20.261
for obstructing justice. So,

31:20.310 --> 31:22.574
option B:

31:22.610 --> 31:25.340
We lie to Antoine.
Tell him

31:25.380 --> 31:28.417
that Laura is really,
truly, sincerely dead.

31:28.450 --> 31:30.418
- Despite the fact
that we know the truth:

31:30.450 --> 31:32.941
the woman of his
dreams is alive.

31:32.990 --> 31:36.050
- And that she's just as
miserable without him
as he is without her.

31:36.090 --> 31:37.955
- Right when he's getting his
hopes up again. I mean, that

31:37.990 --> 31:40.026
could crush him for life.
How could you do that?

31:40.060 --> 31:41.948
!
- Well, I'm certainly not gonna

31:42.000 --> 31:43.695
be the one to break
his heart all over again.

31:43.730 --> 31:47.325
- Neither am I!

31:51.240 --> 31:53.936
- She's pretending to ignore us.
I'm not

31:53.980 --> 31:56.574
getting involved in this.

31:56.610 --> 31:59.101
- Is that the murder
Laura witnessed?

31:59.150 --> 32:02.119
- Last year. Turf war ends
with mob execution.

32:02.150 --> 32:05.347
The hitman's still AWOL.
- Stop. Wait.

32:05.390 --> 32:08.279
The wanted poster.
- Yeah, Dennis Farrow.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.027
That's the hitman Laura saw.

32:11.060 --> 32:13.221
- Why, it's the neighbour
from Laura's apartment building.

32:13.260 --> 32:15.148
- Has he been a step
ahead of us all along?

32:15.200 --> 32:18.226
- Or one step behind. Remember
all those times I thought
I was being tailed?

32:20.630 --> 32:23.633
Ah Dammit. Zoe--
- Already dialing.

32:23.670 --> 32:26.605
- Hello, Sergeant Blake,

32:26.640 --> 32:28.972
I've got--
- Everett and Shade.

32:29.010 --> 32:31.706
- [Which part of goodbye don't
the two of you understand?

32:31.750 --> 32:34.275
- We may have a situation.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.117
- It doesn't sound

32:36.150 --> 32:38.038
like you're in a car.
- We pulled over for a minute.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.046
Laura needed a restroom.

32:40.090 --> 32:42.979
with her right this second?

32:43.020 --> 32:44.988
she's with the toilet. Guys,

32:45.030 --> 32:47.021
really? You need a new hobby.

32:47.060 --> 32:50.120
to believe the hitman, Farrow,
followed us to the motel.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.469
- We saw his picture,

32:52.500 --> 32:54.297
it's a long story.
Could you check on Laura?

32:54.340 --> 32:56.331
- Now, please!

33:06.410 --> 33:08.412
- Dammit!
: What?

33:08.450 --> 33:10.213
: She's gone.

33:16.790 --> 33:19.759
- If you two had just listened
to me in the first place--

33:19.790 --> 33:21.724
- You lied to us.
- I was doing my job, trying

33:21.760 --> 33:23.694
to protect the young woman.
- If you'd trusted us

33:23.730 --> 33:26.164
with the truth, none of us
would be in this mess right now.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.168
- Let's go for a walk.
I gotta take this upstairs.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.168
You two, go home.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.634
: I guess
the best

33:32.670 --> 33:34.433
we can hope for is that
Farrow doesn't have her.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.801
Yet.
- To think of her

33:36.840 --> 33:39.673
just out there on her own. And
we have no idea where she is.

33:52.630 --> 33:56.088
- Antoine...
***

34:19.820 --> 34:23.210
I never stopped believing.
- I know. They told me.

34:26.430 --> 34:28.591
- Let me look at you.
- There's something I have

34:28.630 --> 34:30.723
to tell you. Something I
should've told you a year ago.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.467
I'm sorry...
- It doesn't matter!

34:33.500 --> 34:35.832
You're here now.

34:38.740 --> 34:41.675
- Laura, thank god.
- You gotta come with us.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.769
- Just let me explain--

34:43.810 --> 34:46.847
- Down! Down!

34:49.620 --> 34:52.544
-H3Mm!
- We're sitting ducks, here.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.252
- We gotta move. You take
Antoine, I'll take Laura?

34:55.290 --> 34:58.123
- OK. Antoine...
- Guys...

34:58.160 --> 35:01.129
- They need a distraction.
C'mon, Antoine!

35:03.330 --> 35:05.594
- Go, go!

35:12.770 --> 35:14.704
Nolan?

35:14.740 --> 35:17.231
Get down to the concert
hall. Farrow's here.

35:19.710 --> 35:21.712
- We're _under the orchestra
pit. That leads

35:21.750 --> 35:23.775
to the maintenance tunnels
and a fire exit to the street.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.640
- Oh! Too late.

35:25.690 --> 35:28.716
Plan B.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.580
***

35:40.830 --> 35:42.764
If we're lucky,

35:42.800 --> 35:44.939
there'll be an escape
pod at the top.

35:54.950 --> 35:57.316
***

36:04.490 --> 36:07.857
This isn't exactly the escape
pod I was hoping for.

36:07.890 --> 36:10.450
- There's a staircase that goes
down to the loading dock.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.468
If we can get there,
we can get out.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.468
- OK.

36:17.370 --> 36:19.338
- Oh!

36:19.370 --> 36:22.737
- Antoine!

36:22.780 --> 36:25.499
- This is all my fault.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.848
He's gonna kill us both.
- Ah, come on,

36:27.880 --> 36:29.973
what kind of attitude is that?

36:30.020 --> 36:33.888
Hey, Farrow! Clearly you
have us at a disadvantage!

36:33.920 --> 36:37.708
- Yeah, you're a genius.

36:37.760 --> 36:41.628
: You know,
in the movies...

36:41.660 --> 36:44.788
this is the point where... the
hero always tries to talk sense

36:44.830 --> 36:47.469
into the gunman.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.468
I'm not gonna
try to do that.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.639
First of all,
you're too smart.

36:51.670 --> 36:54.434
Secondly, I'm
not a hero.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.971
- So, if you
want the girl...

36:59.880 --> 37:01.973
...she's all yours!
: What are you doing!?

37:02.020 --> 37:04.818
: You gotta trust me.
!

37:04.850 --> 37:06.886
- I got this.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.457
And I was never here.

37:09.490 --> 37:12.721
Go! Go-go-go! GO!

37:20.600 --> 37:23.364
- They're heading
to the eastern wall.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.607
- Wait!

37:55.600 --> 37:57.465
- The loading dock's
through there.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.559
- Stand back.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.532
- Nothing that six months of
physio and my favorite bottle

38:01.580 --> 38:04.743
of Macallan won't take care of!

38:07.650 --> 38:09.845
Ah... Ah...

38:09.880 --> 38:11.882
- Here it is.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.480
- Let's go.

38:17.820 --> 38:21.722
- Please... no...
- Nothing personal,

38:21.760 --> 38:23.489
you were just at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

38:23.530 --> 38:27.068
- You know what, I changed my
mind. Let's talk about this.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.068
You and me, man to man.
- I'm gonna like

38:29.100 --> 38:30.897
killing you first.
- Drop your weapon!

38:41.880 --> 38:44.542
- He's gone.

38:47.850 --> 38:50.978
- Thanks, Nolan.

38:51.020 --> 38:53.386
I didn't know you cared.

38:53.430 --> 38:55.421
- I just didn't want
the extra paperwork.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.461
- Luckily, I can run like hell

39:00.500 --> 39:02.468
and speed dial at the same time.

39:02.500 --> 39:05.606
- Thank god you're safe.
-Iam.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.609
Iam.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.438
Is it really over?

39:11.480 --> 39:13.698
- Welcome back, Laura.

39:13.750 --> 39:17.641
***

39:17.680 --> 39:20.342
- I can't believe it.
We're free.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.922
***

39:33.430 --> 39:35.466
***

39:35.500 --> 39:38.936
(indistinct end of sentence
and police radio coms)

39:38.970 --> 39:41.871
- Guess we kinda helped you wrap
up a year-long manhunt.

39:41.910 --> 39:43.832
- And I'm grateful for that.
- You're welcome.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.405
- Which is why I'm gonna make
the both of you a promise.

39:46.450 --> 39:49.647
- I promise that...
if I ever

39:49.680 --> 39:52.012
catch you interfering in a
federal investigation again,

39:52.050 --> 39:54.848
I'll dump both your asses in
jail and throw away the key.

39:54.890 --> 39:57.450
- Understood.

39:57.490 --> 39:59.151
And thanks.
- Hey.

39:59.190 --> 40:03.058
Hate to break up a good team.

40:03.100 --> 40:06.092
- He's a great guy.
- He is.

40:06.130 --> 40:08.564
- Can't believe the two of y--
- Stop.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.795
- I mean, he's handsome,
intelligent, honest--

40:10.840 --> 40:13.058
- Oh my god! Do you
wanna date him?

40:15.980 --> 40:18.778
- Ah crap! It's my Dad...

40:18.810 --> 40:21.005
I thought this might happen.

40:21.050 --> 40:24.713
- He's called a family meeting.
This could be big. And bad.

40:24.750 --> 40:27.787
- Well, do you
want me to go with? Not
that you need the support...

40:27.820 --> 40:29.617
- No, of course not.
- OK.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.855
- But...

40:31.890 --> 40:33.881
would you mind?

40:33.930 --> 40:36.091
- Of course.

40:36.130 --> 40:38.121
In fact, I insist.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.094
***

40:45.110 --> 40:47.738
- No, Grandpa didn't
tell me anything.

40:47.770 --> 40:50.807
- Shh... here he comes.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.842
- Hey, guys. Um...

40:52.880 --> 40:56.008
OK. So...

40:56.050 --> 40:58.848
- Oh, God...

40:58.890 --> 41:02.587
- Look, Dad, I know we've
never talked like this, but...

41:02.620 --> 41:05.919
whatever it is...
I'm here for you, OK?

41:05.960 --> 41:09.498
- That's very
kind of you, Matt.

41:09.530 --> 41:11.498
It's very strange,
but it's very kind.

41:11.530 --> 41:15.068
OK. So...
here it is.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.898
I have... bought into

41:17.940 --> 41:20.204
Shona's diner.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.879
- We're now full partners.

41:22.910 --> 41:25.071
- Yeah.
- Grandpa, that's

41:25.110 --> 41:27.169
so cool!
: Yeah!

41:29.620 --> 41:31.542
You and... Shona,
you're... business partners?

41:31.590 --> 41:34.241
- Yeah!
- But Dad,

41:34.290 --> 41:36.554
the doctors, the lawyers,
the estate planning...

41:36.590 --> 41:38.285
- I was just getting
my ducks in a row.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.652
- Dad, I thought you were dying!

41:40.690 --> 41:43.898
- No. No.

41:43.930 --> 41:46.194
No! Far from it!

41:46.230 --> 41:48.869
In fact, the doc says
that, uh, I'll be around

41:48.900 --> 41:51.539
long enough to be a great
grandfather. No pressure, Jules.

41:51.570 --> 41:53.936
- Grandpa, gross!

41:53.970 --> 41:56.530
- Now since you're all here...
- Ah, Shona's new

41:56.580 --> 41:59.845
jerk recipe. Ah...
- This guy ate my last
batch all in one sitting.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.973
- Yeah, and it's worth the
stomach cramps, believe me.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.682
- I hope it's nice and spicy.
- Trust me, girl,

42:04.720 --> 42:06.938
you have never tasted
anything like it.

42:06.990 --> 42:10.551
- Mm, Fiona... Unbelievable!

42:10.590 --> 42:12.558
- Mm!
- Really good.

42:12.590 --> 42:15.195
(Chopin's Nocturne
in E flat on piano)

42:28.070 --> 42:30.038
- See you tomorrow, mom.

42:54.300 --> 42:57.235
- See, partner...

42:57.270 --> 43:00.068
some love stories
do have happy endings.

43:10.820 --> 43:14.210
Bravo!

43:18.860 --> 43:20.623
