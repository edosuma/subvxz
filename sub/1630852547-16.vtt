WEBVTT

00:03.729 --> 00:05.245
Wait, what the hell?

00:05.339 --> 00:07.914
Why are you wearing somebody's
old-ass tablecloth?

00:08.676 --> 00:10.901
Oscar's coming over
and I broke his heart.

00:10.994 --> 00:14.421
So I feel like, as the dumper,
I owe it to the injured party,

00:14.515 --> 00:17.241
i.e. the dumpee,
to not flaunt my feminine wiles

00:17.259 --> 00:19.334
in this, his time of need.

00:19.428 --> 00:21.186
Well, mission accomplished.

00:21.263 --> 00:23.080
Why do you even own that?

00:23.098 --> 00:25.173
It was ten years ago,
it was an art fair,

00:25.251 --> 00:27.267
I was probably
high on kettle corn.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.529
Wait, is all that Oscar's?
You know the move here

00:30.756 --> 00:32.013
is to sell what you can
and throw the rest

00:32.107 --> 00:33.532
of that crap in the river.

00:33.759 --> 00:35.092
Oh, great. So, then
I'll be home, watching the news,

00:35.185 --> 00:36.684
and they'll be dragging
a dead body from the river

00:36.762 --> 00:38.779
and it'll be wearing
Oscar's Imagine Dragons T-shirt?

00:38.931 --> 00:40.039
How will I feel then?

00:40.190 --> 00:43.600
-Wait, isn't this your tablet?
-Oh, yeah,

00:43.693 --> 00:45.769
but Oscar used to play
<i> Grand Theft Auto</i> on it.

00:45.862 --> 00:48.196
I thought beating up pimps
might be good for him right now.

00:48.290 --> 00:51.108
Fine, but he is not getting
these brownies that you made.

00:51.201 --> 00:53.052
No, they're chocolate
scotcheroos, his favorite.

00:53.203 --> 00:55.537
You're giving him
a damn breakup gift basket.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.281
You think I should
skip all this and just

00:57.415 --> 00:58.632
read him the haiku I wrote?

00:58.726 --> 01:01.042
Do not-- I repeat, do not--

01:01.062 --> 01:02.728
read Oscar a haiku.

01:02.879 --> 01:03.896
You haven't even heard it...

01:04.123 --> 01:05.972
-No, oh, eh!
-(knocking)

01:06.067 --> 01:09.068
Haikus and scotcheroos.
Crazy person.

01:13.999 --> 01:15.574
Hey.

01:15.725 --> 01:17.993
Hey, come on in.

01:20.973 --> 01:22.748
Here. This is all your stuff.

01:22.825 --> 01:24.416
Okay, right to it.
(chuckles)

01:24.568 --> 01:28.328
Lemon-scented and ForceFlex.
Bougie.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.314
(chuckles)

01:30.407 --> 01:31.406
That mine?

01:31.425 --> 01:33.166
Yeah. And-and
a few extra things, too.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.410
I-I thought you should have
custody of our shared

01:35.504 --> 01:38.246
froyo punch card. Two more
and you get a free sundae.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.582
Premium toppings excluded.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.008
Okay.

01:42.161 --> 01:43.343
And in your email
you'll be finding a link

01:43.495 --> 01:45.345
to a Spotify breakup playlist.

01:45.497 --> 01:47.255
80 minutes of songs
that speak to

01:47.274 --> 01:48.607
where your heart is right now.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.258
How much of it is Adele?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.093
Well, I think the right amount.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.670
So, all of it.

01:53.763 --> 01:54.929
(chuckles)

01:55.023 --> 01:56.006
Okay.

01:56.024 --> 01:58.508
-Oscar, can we talk?
-About what?

01:58.602 --> 02:00.619
Well, you-you know
I feel horrible

02:00.846 --> 02:02.604
about how this went down.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.606
You feel horrible?

02:04.700 --> 02:06.533
I had to bring back
an engagement ring.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.293
The guy looked at me
like I was some kind of loser

02:08.445 --> 02:10.354
who got his proposal shot down.

02:10.372 --> 02:13.715
You know why?
'Cause I am.

02:16.545 --> 02:18.044
Love, big, and gorgeous,

02:18.139 --> 02:21.047
a bear's life in the forest,

02:21.142 --> 02:23.625
now, hibernation.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.727
Goodbye.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.724
(door closes)

02:30.876 --> 02:33.877
Oscar heartbroken,

02:33.896 --> 02:37.047
art fair kettle corn yummy,

02:37.065 --> 02:39.474
play, sad playlist,

02:39.493 --> 02:41.243

Why? I'm great. I'm great. Ah.

03:38.444 --> 03:39.718
Are you sure? Because
you took your lunch break

03:39.869 --> 03:43.447
three hours ago and now
you are shotgunning boxed wine

03:43.465 --> 03:45.373
like you just
got into Sigma Chi.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.393
I hate seeing you so upset.

03:48.545 --> 03:50.378
There, there.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.898
Ah, the comfort
of a mother's touch.

03:53.049 --> 03:54.566
Brought you a sandwich
and fries. Why don't you

03:54.793 --> 03:58.570
have some of this
and a little less peach moscato?

03:58.797 --> 04:00.981
I don't deserve fries.
Fries are for good people,

04:01.133 --> 04:04.468
like Oscar or Jesus
or Savannah Guthrie.

04:04.561 --> 04:05.652
With those abs,

04:05.804 --> 04:08.655
there's no way Jesus ate fries.

04:09.658 --> 04:11.808
Randy, did I just throw away
my only chance at love

04:11.901 --> 04:13.643
and now I'm destined
to die alone?

04:13.662 --> 04:16.571
Probably. There, there.

04:16.740 --> 04:19.073
Can you pat me with the hand
that doesn't have rings on it?

04:19.167 --> 04:21.668
Oh, I'm sorry,
that's my wedding ring.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.987
I guess you wouldn't understand.

04:25.099 --> 04:29.101
Oh, Kat, it-it's time to
stop feeling sorry for yourself.

04:29.252 --> 04:31.661
Get back on your feet
and live your life.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.088
-How am I supposed to do that?
-Ooh! I don't know.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.440
But maybe first take a shower,

04:35.667 --> 04:37.943
because you smell like
cheap wine and sadness.

04:38.170 --> 04:40.445
And just a kiss of B.O.

04:40.597 --> 04:42.764
Yeah, get out of the house.
Go get some dinner.

04:42.841 --> 04:45.025
You know, after that shower.

04:45.193 --> 04:46.809
Well, who wants to have dinner
with me tonight?

04:46.811 --> 04:49.771
Oh, tonight? Nicole and I are
going on a riverboat cruise.

04:49.865 --> 04:51.531
Carter's working
and I have class.

04:51.683 --> 04:53.683
Sheila and I are going
to see Dolly Parton.

04:53.777 --> 04:54.868
But we could skip it.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.521
Shut your stupid little mouth.

04:57.539 --> 04:58.705
I'm sorry,

04:58.874 --> 05:01.041
it's just... it's Dolly.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.467
No, actually, this is better.
You know,

05:02.694 --> 05:04.544
I need to get used
to being alone again.

05:04.696 --> 05:06.212
Yeah, I'll take myself
out to dinner.

05:06.365 --> 05:07.955
There you go. You spent

05:07.975 --> 05:11.101
the first 40 years of your life
alone, you can do 40 more.

05:12.128 --> 05:14.187
In a good way.

05:16.892 --> 05:18.633
Hi there.
Someone else joining you?

05:18.652 --> 05:22.821
Nope, party of one.
Or should I say party of fun.

05:23.048 --> 05:25.549
Can I get you
something to drink?

05:25.567 --> 05:26.641
Complimentary bread?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.068
I'll take a martini

05:28.162 --> 05:30.645
and bread that tells me
I'm pretty. (chuckles)

05:30.664 --> 05:33.957
Complimentary? Wordpl...
I'll take the martini.

05:40.248 --> 05:41.247
Ooh.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.343
Cloudy with a 20%
chance of rain tomorrow.

05:44.494 --> 05:47.012
Okay.

05:47.089 --> 05:50.265
Software update?
Uh, yes, please. (chuckles)

05:54.170 --> 05:55.687
How you two doing tonight?

05:57.173 --> 05:59.006
I like your top.
Very Meghan Markle.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.084
Thank you.

06:02.087 --> 06:03.587
Is that the risotto?
I was looking at that.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.863
How's the mouth feel?

06:05.014 --> 06:05.939
It's good.

06:06.091 --> 06:08.575
Four stars from
my table-neighbor.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.113
-Here you go.
-Thank you. Oh,

06:13.207 --> 06:14.706
Oh, she forgot my bread.
Guess she's trying

06:14.875 --> 06:16.875
to get her steps in. (chuckles)

06:17.102 --> 06:19.252
NICK:
Hey, Kitty Kat.

06:20.606 --> 06:21.621
Nick?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.957
He owns the sandwich shop
down the street.

06:24.109 --> 06:25.959
So annoying,
so full of himself,

06:26.111 --> 06:28.628
so chiseled and buff.
Blech.

06:28.780 --> 06:30.705
Eating by yourself?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.558
-Uh, yes. Taking myself
on a little date.
-Hm.

06:33.710 --> 06:36.970
I'll take lamest Friday night
for 500, Ken.

06:37.122 --> 06:38.638
Uncalled for.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.641
For your information,
I'm having a lovely time, and...

06:41.793 --> 06:43.050
Why are you sitting down?

06:43.219 --> 06:44.903
Well, 'cause I don't like
eating standing up. (chuckles)

06:45.054 --> 06:46.554
Ooh, that a martini?

06:46.648 --> 06:48.815
Uh, it's my-tini.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.391
My-tini?

06:50.485 --> 06:53.203
You know, that kind of wordplay
might be why you're alone.

06:56.475 --> 06:58.166
(door opens)

06:58.994 --> 07:00.310
What's up, baby?

07:00.403 --> 07:03.404
Oh, hey.
What-what are you doing here?

07:03.498 --> 07:06.073
In my home. Alone.

07:06.151 --> 07:08.743
Oh, I spilled cherry syrup
on myself at the bar.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.928
Max thought I got stabbed.

07:10.079 --> 07:11.488
That boy is so sheltered.

07:11.506 --> 07:14.290
I mean, I also yelled,
"Aah! I got stabbed!"

07:15.327 --> 07:16.826
Anyway, your place
is closer than mine,

07:16.845 --> 07:18.103
so I came here to clean up.

07:18.330 --> 07:19.438
Well, how did you get in?

07:19.665 --> 07:20.830
Max gave me a key.

07:20.832 --> 07:22.015
Mm.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.442
So, how was art history?

07:23.593 --> 07:26.169
Oh, dull.
Two hours of impressionists--

07:26.188 --> 07:27.595
it's blurry, we get it.

07:27.689 --> 07:31.116
Well, uh, maybe I can
help liven up your day.

07:31.267 --> 07:33.526
You want to, you know...

07:33.679 --> 07:35.996
(vocalizes funky tune)

07:37.349 --> 07:39.349
Or you can vacuum that couch

07:39.351 --> 07:41.293
because you eat like
a first grader at story time.

07:41.444 --> 07:44.779
What if we, uh...
(vocalizes funky tune)

07:44.798 --> 07:46.614
(singsongy): right now?

07:46.783 --> 07:48.525
And then I'll vacuum after?

07:48.543 --> 07:50.026
Okay.

07:50.028 --> 07:51.595
(both giggling)

07:53.532 --> 07:55.265
I'll vacuum now.

07:57.385 --> 07:59.961
So, yeah,<i> Louisville Magazine</i>
wants to do an article about me

07:59.980 --> 08:01.721
calling me
the charcuterie cutie.

08:01.798 --> 08:03.890
I mean, I didn't
come up with it,

08:03.984 --> 08:05.208
but you can tweet me--

08:05.227 --> 08:08.394
@Charcuterie_QT.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.046
I bet you a hundred bucks
this guy

08:10.065 --> 08:11.731
doesn't ask
a single thing about me.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.493
So, what's going on with you?
How are things at the cat café?

08:14.661 --> 08:16.903
Well, obviously,
I can't pay each of you $100.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.665
But isn't what we have
better than money?

08:20.892 --> 08:22.650
Did you just ask about me?

08:22.819 --> 08:24.652
Yeah. How's business?

08:24.821 --> 08:26.338
Good. I mean,

08:26.565 --> 08:28.656
kind of thought by now
I'd be in a position

08:28.675 --> 08:32.043
to buy my building, but I did
just get a new cat tree.

08:32.270 --> 08:34.846
I'm just gonna smile and pretend
that that's not pathetic.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.681
And I'm just gonna smile
and pretend like

08:36.833 --> 08:38.408
you're not a giant douche.

08:38.501 --> 08:42.428
I normally suck at comebacks,
but that was pretty good, right?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.672
I am at most a medium douche.
But, hey,

08:44.766 --> 08:47.008
buying your building
would be a good investment.

08:47.102 --> 08:49.419
Yeah. Just, I'm starting to
think about retirement.

08:49.512 --> 08:51.196
Plus, I could put a billboard
of myself on the roof

08:51.347 --> 08:54.424
that says, "Yo, Louisville,
I own this bitch."

08:55.184 --> 08:57.927
By the way,
where's your boyfriend?

08:57.946 --> 09:00.187
Um, actually,
Oscar and I broke up.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.781
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

09:01.933 --> 09:03.375
Hey, relationships are tough.

09:03.526 --> 09:05.785
I thought I'd be on
my third wife by now.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.771
You really think
three women would marry you?

09:07.789 --> 09:10.882
In my mind, one and three
are the same woman.

09:11.034 --> 09:13.367
If I can fool her once,
I can fool her twice.

09:13.461 --> 09:14.611
(chuckles)
And wife number two

09:14.629 --> 09:16.129
would just go back
to being the nanny.

09:16.298 --> 09:18.782
-Exactly.
-(laughs)

09:18.800 --> 09:22.143
Wait, am I having a good time?

09:25.715 --> 09:27.974
I am having a good time.

09:28.143 --> 09:30.885
Rebound sex is awesome.

09:31.054 --> 09:32.529
Excuse me.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.247
Oh, dear.

09:42.398 --> 09:46.492
This seemed like
such a good idea last night.

09:46.645 --> 09:48.903
Nick.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.463
Nick?

09:52.651 --> 09:54.134
Still breathing.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.653
Still beating.

09:56.655 --> 09:58.722
Still taut and juicy.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.101
Nick.

10:03.328 --> 10:04.418
Nick!

10:04.512 --> 10:07.147
I'm new to casual sex.
Is this normal?

10:12.613 --> 10:14.946
Yeah, hey, Randi, um...

10:15.173 --> 10:17.115
can you come up here
for a second?

10:17.266 --> 10:18.950
Yeah, and if you've got 'em, um,

10:19.177 --> 10:21.102
bring jumper cables.

10:21.196 --> 10:24.848
Well, look what
the Kat dragged in.

10:24.941 --> 10:26.349
Ha, ha, ha, very clever.

10:26.368 --> 10:28.701
Can you holster your wit
and help me wake him?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.019
Well, what did you do to him?

10:30.038 --> 10:32.113
I did all the, you know,

10:32.132 --> 10:33.373
good sex stuff.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.192
Which obviously
left him depleted.

10:36.285 --> 10:37.952
Or it was his sleeping pills.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.379
It was the sex stuff.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.805
Look, Kat, I'm all for you

10:40.957 --> 10:43.642
getting your spice where
it's nice, but Nick-- really?

10:43.827 --> 10:45.869
Trust me, I don't want
people to know. Just help me

10:45.887 --> 10:47.537
-get him to the shower.
-Okay.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.481
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Does he have boxers on?

10:49.557 --> 10:50.707
'Cause I do not
want to start my day

10:50.725 --> 10:52.525
with all that flopping at me.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.528
We're good. Flopper in the cage.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.566
-Okay, just... I'll get...
-All right. Okay.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.828
-Okay. (grunts)
-Ooh.

11:04.055 --> 11:05.905
Was he this heavy
when he was on top of you?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.499
Actually, I was the one
who was on t...

11:07.668 --> 11:09.517
-You know what, never mind.
Just go over there.
-Okay, okay.

11:09.577 --> 11:11.152
-Got it?
-Got it.

11:11.246 --> 11:13.487
-Three, two, one.
-(grunts)

11:13.656 --> 11:16.900
Oh. Uh...
-Oh, wait...

11:16.993 --> 11:21.070
Is this your first threesome?

11:21.164 --> 11:22.422
Okay, new plan, new plan.

11:22.574 --> 11:23.515
We leave him a note

11:23.666 --> 11:24.999
and I tell him
to go out the front door.

11:25.168 --> 11:26.518
That way no one'll see him.

11:26.669 --> 11:28.019
Okay. That'll work.

11:28.171 --> 11:30.522
But why does it
smell like stripper in here?

11:30.598 --> 11:32.098
Oh, strawberry love oil.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.599
My mom gives it to me
every Hanukkah.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.585
It's kosher.

11:35.603 --> 11:37.195
(chuckles)

11:37.272 --> 11:39.013
Hey Randi, can I get a coffee?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.181
We're out.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.941
You just gave some to that guy.

11:42.093 --> 11:43.535
Oh, well, that guy
didn't give my boyfriend

11:43.704 --> 11:45.203
a key to my apartment.

11:45.430 --> 11:47.372
Come on, it's not
that big a deal.

11:47.523 --> 11:50.191
Aw, well, neither is
making your own damn coffee.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.952
(sighs)
Phil, can I get a coffee?

11:53.104 --> 11:56.548
Sorry, I'm team Randi.
She scares me.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.625
I got you. She doesn't scare me.

11:59.702 --> 12:02.220
But if she asks,
you got this out of the garbage.

12:02.371 --> 12:04.280
Hey, Sheila. How's it going?

12:04.299 --> 12:05.465
Oh, I was just accosted

12:05.617 --> 12:08.634
by a pack of youths
begging for money.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.563
Mother, those are Girl Scouts
selling cookies.

12:11.714 --> 12:14.691
Giving them a name
only legitimizes them.

12:15.718 --> 12:17.235
How was your evening?

12:18.129 --> 12:21.406
Fine. I-I took myself out,
it was fine.

12:21.557 --> 12:23.057
What'd you do?

12:23.109 --> 12:24.725
Just went to dinner.

12:24.745 --> 12:25.744
And then what?

12:25.971 --> 12:27.579
Why do you assume
there's a "then what"?

12:27.730 --> 12:29.989
There was no "then what."
Back off, Max.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.501
I am not impressed with
the customer service today.

12:36.998 --> 12:38.498
Uh, Kat?

12:38.592 --> 12:39.983
Oh, oh, this is not good.

12:40.001 --> 12:42.927
Hey Kitty Kat,
can I get a coffee to go?

12:43.096 --> 12:47.098
Oh, my. It appears Ms. Silver
had a gentleman caller.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.084
So there was a "then what."

12:50.103 --> 12:53.012
Katharine, I didn't know
you had it in you.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.515
Oh, she had it in her.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.351
Um... (chuckles) what are-what
are you doing down here?

12:58.503 --> 12:59.885
Didn't you get my note?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.447
Yeah, "Last night was great.
Please go out the front door."

13:02.616 --> 13:05.174
Not this front door.
The front door to my apartment.

13:05.193 --> 13:06.785
A-And I didn't write
"last night was great."

13:06.936 --> 13:07.860
I wrote "I had a great time."

13:08.013 --> 13:09.454
The sex was great, you know,

13:09.605 --> 13:12.123
and so what if the sex was
great? I deserve great sex.

13:12.275 --> 13:13.666
Wrong front door, Nick!

13:21.784 --> 13:23.693
Hey, baby. You want some eggs?

13:23.711 --> 13:25.786
What are you doing here again?

13:25.880 --> 13:28.047
I thought I'd squeeze in a nap
during my lunch break.

13:28.199 --> 13:29.715
Why are you wearing my bonnet?

13:29.868 --> 13:33.369
Oh, I didn't bring my own.
I got to protect the gold.

13:33.388 --> 13:34.461
And my robe?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.463
If I'm napping,
I'm taking my pants off.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.058
Plus, this is buttery soft
and smells amazing.

13:39.210 --> 13:40.151
How do you do that?

13:40.303 --> 13:42.879
I wash it.
But who let you in?

13:42.897 --> 13:44.805
I did.
Max gave me the key, remember?

13:44.825 --> 13:47.383
-Wh... I thought
you gave that back.
-Why would I do that?

13:47.402 --> 13:50.403
Because I am not ready for you
to have a key to my apartment.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.738
What's the big deal?
You have the key to my heart.

13:52.891 --> 13:56.334
No. No, no, no, that was your
lame-ass Valentine's Day present

13:56.485 --> 13:58.002
-because you forgot.
-(gasps)

13:58.154 --> 13:59.486
I got news for you:

13:59.506 --> 14:01.673
your free massage coupons
just expired.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.824
Carter, you can't just come
over here whenever you want.

14:03.993 --> 14:06.994
-Well, why not?
-Because it's too much
like we're living together.

14:07.163 --> 14:08.346
Oh, and I guess
that's a bad thing.

14:08.573 --> 14:10.907
Look at yourself.
It's not a good thing.

14:11.076 --> 14:13.000
Fine. I'll go
drain my bubble bath,

14:13.019 --> 14:16.020
blow out the candles
and leave.

14:24.013 --> 14:26.105
-Hey, Kat.
-What's going on?

14:26.257 --> 14:27.773
Can I get a double bourbon?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.850
You know it's 2:00
in the afternoon.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.777
I need a bartender, not a clock.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.371
I don't know what's going on,

14:33.598 --> 14:36.099
but this is not
a good day to be a man.

14:36.117 --> 14:37.709
-You okay?
-Yeah,

14:37.860 --> 14:38.951
I'm sorry.
Just, life keeps

14:39.045 --> 14:41.604
kicking me
right in my girl balls.

14:41.623 --> 14:43.106
Still upset about Oscar?

14:43.199 --> 14:45.366
No. I mean, yes, but,

14:45.385 --> 14:46.867
it's, uh... (clears throat)

14:46.961 --> 14:48.369
-talking about the other stuff.
-CARTER: Oh.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.464
Is this about
you and Nick getting busy?

14:51.616 --> 14:53.132
Did you tell him?

14:53.284 --> 14:56.452
Kat, come on, I care about you,
I wouldn't do that.

14:56.471 --> 14:58.287
Your mother did.

14:58.306 --> 14:59.639
So what do I do about Nick?

14:59.733 --> 15:01.882
It was a one-night stand.
You do the same thing I did

15:01.976 --> 15:03.884
when I hooked up with
your roommate in college.

15:03.978 --> 15:05.570
That happened more than once.

15:05.721 --> 15:07.071
God, I miss college.

15:07.298 --> 15:08.907
Yeah.
I never went to college.

15:09.058 --> 15:11.409
But I had a lot
of one-night stands.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.245
Well, I have never had one
before. What happens next?

15:14.472 --> 15:16.139
Nothing. You've done
everything and everyone

15:16.157 --> 15:17.916
that needed to be done.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.475
CARTER:
Yeah. You had your fun.

15:19.568 --> 15:21.144
Now you just got to hope
it isn't too awkward

15:21.162 --> 15:23.630
at your son's next
parent-teacher conference.

15:24.832 --> 15:26.666
Well, I'm gonna
see him all the time.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.835
Like, what do I do
if he wants more of this?

15:29.988 --> 15:32.096
Sex moves.

15:35.418 --> 15:38.252
Hey, Brutus. Looking handsome.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.437
Keep up the good work.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.997
Oh, what about me?
I'm handsome. I do good work.

15:41.015 --> 15:42.089
I've been told.

15:42.183 --> 15:44.016
By you. Last night.

15:44.169 --> 15:46.002
Three times.

15:46.020 --> 15:47.837
Damn these sex moves.

15:47.855 --> 15:51.174
Yeah, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

15:51.192 --> 15:52.675
Talk away, Kitty Kat.

15:52.768 --> 15:55.178
Um, well, last night was fun,

15:55.196 --> 15:57.271
but it was kind of
a low point for me.

15:57.365 --> 15:59.606
Like, this is forgetting
to wear a bra

15:59.626 --> 16:01.517
on seventh grade picture day,
and then

16:01.536 --> 16:05.021
this is you,
like, way down here,

16:05.039 --> 16:06.372
below clogging the toilet

16:06.524 --> 16:08.615
at Captain Darby's
Shrimp Boat after prom.

16:08.693 --> 16:10.451
Wow, awesome stories.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.470
You should
go tell 'em on TikTok.

16:12.621 --> 16:15.473
Um, uh, yeah, so, I just
wanted to make it clear

16:15.624 --> 16:18.309
that, uh, last night
was a-a one-time thing.

16:18.461 --> 16:19.869
Okay.

16:19.887 --> 16:21.312
You know, hit it and quit it.

16:21.389 --> 16:22.555
Yep.

16:22.707 --> 16:23.815
Hump 'em and dump 'em.

16:23.966 --> 16:24.816
I got it.

16:25.043 --> 16:26.317
Sex-it and ex-it.

16:26.544 --> 16:28.544
Yes, I'm familiar
with how one-night stands work.

16:28.563 --> 16:30.046
Okay, good, I'm just
not in the headspace right now

16:30.139 --> 16:31.214
to take a lover.

16:31.232 --> 16:33.807
Wow, "headspace
to take a lover."

16:33.827 --> 16:37.662
(English accent):
So, Lady Chatterly's
closed her bedchambers, then?

16:37.813 --> 16:39.313
I'll see you around, Nick.

16:39.365 --> 16:41.557
(regular accent):
Hey, you want to have
breakup sex

16:41.559 --> 16:43.984
on a giant wheel of parmesan
cheese in the back?

16:44.078 --> 16:45.561
What is wrong with you?

16:45.654 --> 16:48.506
How does he know
just the right thing to say?

16:48.657 --> 16:50.717
Let's do this.

16:52.846 --> 16:56.681
All right, the score is nine
to nine, next one wins.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.593
BOTH: One, two, three.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.911
(both grunting)

17:01.929 --> 17:04.338
Oh, you're going down,
little man.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.339
I'm big where it counts.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.341
Oh, that makes me uncomfortable.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.695
I meant my quads.
But also the other thing.

17:10.922 --> 17:13.089
-(rip)
-Oh! Did you just fart?

17:13.107 --> 17:14.848
You know that's
an automatic forfeit.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.109
No.
But I think I ripped my pants.

17:17.262 --> 17:18.110
You want to give up?

17:18.279 --> 17:20.538
-Hell no.
-Oh... (grunts)

17:21.357 --> 17:23.115
Uh, what are y'all doing?

17:23.268 --> 17:25.359
-Working.
-Working.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.361
Can I talk to you for a second?

17:27.455 --> 17:29.438
Sure. (groaning)

17:29.440 --> 17:31.966
I got to go change my pants.

17:34.703 --> 17:35.945
What's up?

17:36.038 --> 17:38.389
Not much. Just haven't
seen you in a couple days.

17:38.541 --> 17:41.542
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, I've been, uh, busy.

17:41.636 --> 17:43.286
Okay. Well, you
want to come over tonight?

17:43.304 --> 17:44.954
Nah, I-I don't think so.

17:44.972 --> 17:47.881
Are you sure? 'Cause we can
have dinner and then maybe,

17:47.901 --> 17:50.276
you know...
(vocalizes funky tune)

17:52.072 --> 17:55.073
It's been a long week.
I'm kind of tired.

17:55.224 --> 17:56.908
Okay, what's going on?

17:57.059 --> 17:58.818
I was thinking that
maybe I should

17:58.970 --> 18:02.638
take a step back
from-from this, from us.

18:03.399 --> 18:05.566
-Wait, what?
-I... I feel like

18:05.585 --> 18:06.733
you've been
fighting this relationship

18:06.828 --> 18:08.144
every step of the way.

18:08.162 --> 18:09.995
Is this 'cause of the key thing?

18:10.090 --> 18:11.756
Because we both agreed
we would take this slow.

18:11.907 --> 18:15.676
We were taking it any slower,
we'd be going backwards.

18:16.579 --> 18:17.929
Wow. Well,

18:18.080 --> 18:21.015
sorry I'm not
sticking to your schedule.

18:24.178 --> 18:27.012
Did you put my backup pants
in the freezer?

18:27.165 --> 18:30.516
I'm not in a joking mood.
But yeah, I did.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.569
(both laugh)

18:35.097 --> 18:36.447
Um, hey, Randi, I-I know

18:36.599 --> 18:37.782
you're having some problems
with Carter.

18:37.859 --> 18:39.433
If you think it might
help,

18:39.527 --> 18:42.787
I do have a "trouble
with your boo" playlist.

18:42.864 --> 18:44.697
How much of it is Adele?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.182
Look, I can't help it
if her songs

18:46.275 --> 18:48.184
apply to almost
every situation.

18:48.202 --> 18:50.944
Well, actually,
it would help to talk this out

18:51.038 --> 18:52.872
with someone
who understands guy drama.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.948
Well, my dear,
you've come to the right place.

18:55.117 --> 18:57.117
-I have a lot of...
-Phil.

18:57.137 --> 19:01.097
Step into my office, darling.
You can call me Dr. Phil.

19:03.368 --> 19:04.642
Hey.

19:04.869 --> 19:07.478
Hey. I'm, uh, glad you're here.
We should probably talk.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.148
Oh, let me guess--
the lady regrets her dalliances,

19:10.299 --> 19:12.817
both upon bed and upon cheese?

19:12.968 --> 19:16.379
Yes. That is never happening
again. Especially not right now,

19:16.397 --> 19:18.047
'cause Randi and Phil
are in the kitchen.

19:18.140 --> 19:19.973
Well, that's probably
best, because

19:19.993 --> 19:21.550
I got a lot
of work to do anyway.

19:21.569 --> 19:24.645
-I just came by to thank you
for your idea.
-What idea?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.480
Well, the other night you
mentioned buying your building,

19:26.499 --> 19:27.740
so I looked into it.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.559
You-you looked into
this building? My building?

19:30.578 --> 19:33.487
-Soon to be my building.
-Your building?

19:33.506 --> 19:36.966
Yeah, I'm buying it.
I'm gonna be your new landlord.

19:38.236 --> 19:41.012
This guy just found
another way to screw me.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.411
He owns my building. He owns
the room that I sleep in.

19:48.504 --> 19:51.080
And the room
he sometimes sleeps in.

19:51.098 --> 19:52.415
Hey, that was just once.

19:52.433 --> 19:54.099
Mm, I heard it was
more than once.

19:54.252 --> 19:56.752
How'd you hear that?
I didn't tell anyone.

19:56.771 --> 19:57.937
-You just told me.
-(gasps)

19:58.089 --> 20:00.347
Oh, gosh.
Well, what can I say?

20:00.441 --> 20:02.849
It's these unstoppable
sex moves.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.619
Yeah.

20:07.598 --> 20:09.207
-Here.
-What's this?

20:09.358 --> 20:11.934
-Just open it.
-Whoa.

20:11.953 --> 20:16.455
My own robe. Won't flatter my
figure like yours, but thanks.

20:16.532 --> 20:18.532
Check the pocket.

20:19.368 --> 20:21.444
-It's a key to my apartment.
-Really?

20:21.462 --> 20:24.222
Yeah. You were right,
I have been

20:24.373 --> 20:26.707
-fighting this relationship.
-Why?

20:26.801 --> 20:29.118
Look, I already pay somebody
by the hour to talk about it.

20:29.211 --> 20:31.120
Just trust me,
I don't want to screw this up.

20:31.138 --> 20:32.396
Baby, I think we both know that

20:32.548 --> 20:34.732
I would be the one
to screw this up.

20:36.218 --> 20:38.069
So, you can come over
whenever you want.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.478
Appreciate that.

20:39.630 --> 20:41.297
Just make sure you text me three
hours in advance.

20:41.466 --> 20:43.132
-Not a problem.
-And Sunday morning is my time.

20:43.225 --> 20:45.134
-Yes, Lord, it is.
-And no more than
two days in a row.

20:45.303 --> 20:46.577
Are you sure you want me
to have this?

20:46.729 --> 20:47.912
No, but I gave it to you anyway.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.990
Maybe I'll surprise you
and stop by tonight.

20:51.084 --> 20:51.916
(chuckles) Don't.

20:52.067 --> 20:53.492
Got it.

20:53.644 --> 20:55.586
KAT and MAX:
One, two,

20:55.738 --> 20:57.646
three. (grunting)

20:57.665 --> 21:00.675
-Oh, you're so strong!
-Oh, geez!

21:01.744 --> 21:02.909
For the record,

21:03.004 --> 21:05.821
these are not
my unstoppable sex moves.
