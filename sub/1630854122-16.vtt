one hell of a terrorist.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.466
I believe
that David Laporta was taken

that Costa inadvertently

11:46.880 --> 11:48.882
told the story

into Costa's contacts as well.

Sorry to interrupt.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.313

of Laporta's disappearance

who works in the area?

Never gives us a good enough
image for facial rec.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.473
he brought these two guys
with him.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.302
- All right, great.
We finally have a suspect.

So what are you two doing
in Rome?

- We were working the same case
as you are, it seems.

13:24.151 --> 13:25.848
- Right,
so back in New York,

13:25.892 --> 13:27.937
we got someone working
undercover, Agent Scola.

13:27.981 --> 13:30.113
And he is trying
to pin down a foreign buyer

13:30.157 --> 13:32.594

industrial-grade explosives.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.204
- And the name David Laporta

13:34.248 --> 13:36.119
popped up on the wires
that Scola had planted.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.425
We didn't think anything
of it then,

13:37.468 --> 13:39.383
but now that Laporta's
gone and disappeared,

13:39.427 --> 13:40.645
we think that it's connected.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.125
- Okay, and you two
are here in person,

13:42.169 --> 13:43.866

this is an imminent threat.

could be days,

13:46.390 --> 13:50.481
but yeah,
someone wants to hit New York.

13:50.525 --> 13:53.006

you've been tracking?

13:53.049 --> 13:54.442
The one looking for explosives?

13:54.485 --> 13:56.139
- Unfortunately, we don't know.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.924
We don't have a description
or a name.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.664
We don't know what they're
looking to blow up or why.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.492
We just know somebody

14:01.536 --> 14:03.886
wants enough damn C-4
to make a bomb.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.280

to plan the attack.

- That's right.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.339
And the target is likely one

14:22.383 --> 14:24.298
of the major
infrastructure projects

14:24.341 --> 14:26.082
that Laporta's firm designed.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.867
That would mean
his abductors need him alive.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.433

but it could close at any time.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.913
So we need to find him fast.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.742
- Based on intel
from Agent Scola in the field,

14:33.785 --> 14:35.875
the C-4 is likely to be used
in New York City

14:35.918 --> 14:37.528
or somewhere
along the eastern seaboard.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.313
So let's, uh,
narrow that down, huh?

14:39.356 --> 14:41.141
- Yeah, I've been digging
into Laporta's projects,

14:41.184 --> 14:43.273
searching for potential targets
in that area,

14:43.317 --> 14:44.361

14:44.405 --> 14:45.928
at least
not in the last five years.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.843

Well, keep digging into that.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.889
- I can jump in on that too.
- Okay, good.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.804
The rest of us will focus
on locating Laporta himself.

14:52.848 --> 14:55.242
Now, our best lead is still
the man in the video footage.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.896
Jamie, what do you got?
- Not a lot.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.158
Nobody in the area

14:58.201 --> 14:59.768
around the Colosseum
recognizes him,

14:59.811 --> 15:01.509
so we're pretty sure
he's not local.

15:01.552 --> 15:02.553

15:02.597 --> 15:04.207
we can't run him
in the databases.

- You know what, let's send
that footage over to 26 Fed.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.211
Maybe my analysts
will surprise us.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.560
They have a way of doing that.
- Good.

15:09.604 --> 15:11.258
Raines,
you were looking into Costa.

15:11.301 --> 15:12.215
Did you find anything
on his phone?

15:15.958 --> 15:17.307
in the two hours
leading up to the meeting.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.874

the potential client

15:20.006 --> 15:21.007
- Right.
So whose number is it?

15:21.050 --> 15:22.095
- That's the problem.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.574

15:23.618 --> 15:25.925

15:29.363 --> 15:32.192

Everybody, let's work together.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.411
Keep communicating,

15:40.461 --> 15:43.116
- Uh, several hours
for the phone number,

15:43.159 --> 15:44.465
is that normal over here?

15:44.508 --> 15:46.293
- Um, no.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.382
No, this seems more like
a deliberate holdup.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.992
- Can we go around them?

15:50.036 --> 15:52.212
- Not legally.
- Who do I talk to?

15:52.255 --> 15:54.257
'Cause I'd very much like
to have that conversation.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.606

16:01.047 --> 16:02.178
This is not

16:02.222 --> 16:04.354
We are guests in their country.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.400
We work on their terms.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.445
- Okay, but, uh,

16:08.489 --> 16:11.971
doing whatever it takes doesn't
usually include waiting around.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.458
- Hey, what's up?
- I just wanted to make sure

16:21.502 --> 16:22.982

16:27.290 --> 16:29.292

if you heard any other news.

- Well, I haven't heard from
him, but that's to be expected.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.220
He's under.
You know what that's like.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.526
- Yeah, of course.

is trust that he is okay,

17:19.733 --> 17:21.170
- All right.
Well, keep me in the loop.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.519
- I will.

17:22.563 --> 17:25.000

shouldn't risk reaching out,

17:50.547 --> 17:52.288

- They helped us to solve the
murder of an American in Milan.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.553
What has changed?
- I've been asking around.

17:56.597 --> 17:59.426
But all Europol will say is,
and I quote,

17:59.469 --> 18:02.342
"In light of
the Americans' recent tactics,

18:02.385 --> 18:03.995

18:06.215 --> 18:07.956

I would surely tell you.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.218
- Well, we better
figure something out,

because I'm telling you,

18:10.480 --> 18:11.960
Agent Valentine
is climbing up the walls.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.440
- Well, keep him away
from the inspector.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.224
For some reason,
the more I push this guy,

18:15.268 --> 18:18.097
the more he wants
to shut us down.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.446

18:41.468 --> 18:42.599
If they made a business call

18:42.643 --> 18:43.774

18:46.734 --> 18:49.258
anyone who might lead
to new business.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.260
Wouldn't be faster just
to ask the phone company?

18:51.304 --> 18:54.176

Yes, it would.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.482
- Wait.
Okay, here we go.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.136
Costa called the same number
three months ago.

- Uh, the 12th, 7:13 p.m.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.315
Can you check
if you have a record

19:02.358 --> 19:04.143
for who he met with
that day or night?

19:04.186 --> 19:07.320
- According to my calendar,
Tommaso was in Minsk.

He was having drinks that night

19:09.060 --> 19:10.497
