00:39.001 --> 00:43.209
A word at the start:
laughing sounds a lot like screaming.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.917
I got my eyelashes done.

01:10.001 --> 01:11.959
Now they really curl.

01:14.167 --> 01:15.959
This feels so soft...

01:36.917 --> 01:39.042
It's looks that matter, right?

01:46.959 --> 01:48.834
Lilico's so cute!

01:50.584 --> 01:52.042
She sure is!

02:43.751 --> 02:45.251
Beauty Ice Bar

02:45.876 --> 02:47.167
For more...

02:48.501 --> 02:49.876
...than 'cute'...

02:50.876 --> 02:52.126
...or 'pretty'...

02:55.042 --> 02:56.584
Beauty Ice Bar

02:59.751 --> 03:02.001
There's a sound inside me.

03:04.709 --> 03:09.584
'Tick tock tick tock,' it says.

03:23.001 --> 03:25.001
Telling me to hurry.

03:35.376 --> 03:40.251
The sound inside me that says
something will soon be over.

04:00.501 --> 04:05.709
HELTER SKELTER

04:10.376 --> 04:13.501
Lilico

04:24.084 --> 04:27.709
The most fascinating thing
about stardom...

04:28.251 --> 04:32.001
...is that it's a kind of deformity,
like cancer.

04:32.251 --> 04:33.167
Sorry?

04:34.126 --> 04:37.501
A fascinating face,
in a state of collapse.

04:38.251 --> 04:39.084
Collapse?

04:43.292 --> 04:44.709
Lilico?

04:45.001 --> 04:47.501
All the high-school girls
want that face.

04:55.001 --> 04:59.584
The skin and muscle movements
don't match the bone structure.

05:00.709 --> 05:03.167
It looks good, but the balance is off.

05:04.001 --> 05:05.709
It's about to collapse.

05:08.001 --> 05:09.626
You think so?

05:11.709 --> 05:14.001
I love morning coffee.

05:14.709 --> 05:18.001
Jet-black darkness
dissolved in a cup.

05:19.042 --> 05:22.251
Sweet, and transient.

05:23.251 --> 05:25.209
Is that a poem?

05:27.209 --> 05:28.292
Nothing.

05:28.959 --> 05:32.001
So what about this clinic?

05:33.001 --> 05:35.001
Tax evasion...

05:35.584 --> 05:36.667
That was first.

05:37.251 --> 05:40.459
Then bribery of politicians.

05:41.001 --> 05:44.917
Now I'm interested in
traffic in baby parts...

05:45.001 --> 05:47.667
...and drug violations.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.001
Well...

05:52.126 --> 05:56.251
...it's certainly convenient
to be pretty...

05:57.126 --> 05:59.584
...but beauty...

05:59.667 --> 06:02.626
...is different from happiness.

06:03.959 --> 06:05.626
Pretty on the outside...

06:06.626 --> 06:10.626
...but like a fruit
the bugs have eaten from within.

06:11.876 --> 06:17.334
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest of them all?

06:23.876 --> 06:26.209
Is that why she fascinates?

06:27.001 --> 06:30.626
Because everyone knows
she'll wither?

06:34.334 --> 06:36.001
Look this way!

06:37.001 --> 06:42.501
Lilico, how does it feel to be
starring in your first movie?

06:43.001 --> 06:45.834
To be honest, I'm nervous.

06:46.542 --> 06:50.001
I can only follow the lead
of these fine actors...

06:50.501 --> 06:52.834
...and learn from them.

06:53.167 --> 06:56.584
Mako, how do you feel
about playing the best friend?

06:58.542 --> 07:00.834
Yeah, uh...

07:01.084 --> 07:05.042
Mako's just so cute!
We're best friends already.

07:05.584 --> 07:09.792
We were just saying
how we're going to do our best, right?

07:17.417 --> 07:18.834
What's this?!

07:20.251 --> 07:25.001
What's going on?
Why am I in a two-shot with her?!

07:26.917 --> 07:27.876
Hada!

07:28.001 --> 07:29.001
Yes?

07:29.084 --> 07:31.001
Turn the heat up.

07:31.876 --> 07:32.459
Answer me!

07:32.542 --> 07:33.501
Right!

07:33.542 --> 07:35.417
Non-carbonated.

07:44.084 --> 07:46.417
I don't like cold water.

07:46.501 --> 07:48.917
Room temperature.

07:49.001 --> 07:49.917
A beauty tip...

07:50.001 --> 07:51.251
Kin-chan...

07:52.501 --> 07:55.501
Once the face is wet...

07:55.917 --> 07:58.001
...you apply foundation.

07:58.417 --> 08:02.501
That's how a pro does it.
Don't forget.

08:08.084 --> 08:09.501
Lilico!

08:11.917 --> 08:15.001
Darling! What are you doing here?

08:15.167 --> 08:19.709
How else do I get to see you?
You're always busy.

08:19.876 --> 08:23.084
I wanted to see you...

08:34.126 --> 08:35.126
Here.

08:59.459 --> 09:01.209
When are you free?

09:07.667 --> 09:10.126
I don't know.

09:27.417 --> 09:29.834
Why don't you just quit?

10:30.126 --> 10:31.792
I'm hard as a rock.

11:13.292 --> 11:17.626
Look at me.

11:19.001 --> 11:21.251
You're mine.

11:23.251 --> 11:24.709
Only mine.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.751
Ow!

11:42.959 --> 11:44.834
I burned myself.

11:46.001 --> 11:48.917
Don't let it get cold!

11:50.001 --> 11:53.501
You always do.

11:54.209 --> 11:56.251
7 a.m. tomorrow.

11:57.792 --> 12:01.251
I've told the boss
she's working her too hard.

12:01.542 --> 12:03.542
Shin!

12:03.792 --> 12:06.584
Michiko! You killed me!

12:15.001 --> 12:16.792
Bon appÃ©tit.

12:20.209 --> 12:22.542
Is Lilico really pretty?

12:26.042 --> 12:29.167
She's really beautiful.

12:29.959 --> 12:31.209
But...

12:32.834 --> 12:35.667
...she's never happy. I pity her.

12:36.501 --> 12:39.001
She's lost without me.

12:49.167 --> 12:51.001
Can I come?

12:53.501 --> 12:55.459
Radish sprouts.

12:56.001 --> 12:57.084
Want some?

12:58.459 --> 13:01.001
Have they ever grown!

13:08.459 --> 13:09.001
Hey...

13:09.167 --> 13:11.459
What are you doing?

13:11.584 --> 13:12.167
Come on.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.667
Not now! After dinner.

13:20.126 --> 13:21.042
Get these down.

13:21.126 --> 13:25.001
They'll see us next door!
Turn off the lights.

13:25.751 --> 13:27.584
Shin!

13:31.417 --> 13:32.834
Don't forget.

13:33.417 --> 13:37.001
Lots of close-ups of me.

13:37.126 --> 13:39.001
I'll work hard.

13:39.501 --> 13:43.126
OK. I'll tell the director.

13:44.001 --> 13:49.876
He's always saying how he doesn't
make movies for little girls.

13:50.542 --> 13:53.667
But if they don't like it,
we're screwed.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.001
Right?

13:56.542 --> 13:59.584
Say hello to your wife and daughter.

14:01.084 --> 14:02.542
Give me a break!

14:03.001 --> 14:04.001
See you.

14:24.042 --> 14:25.626
Mama?

14:29.292 --> 14:31.584
I did it with the producer.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.876
Well done.

14:34.792 --> 14:38.459
Just making sure.

14:39.626 --> 14:41.667
You're sure I'll be OK?

14:43.501 --> 14:46.042
Why wouldn't you be?

14:47.042 --> 14:49.042
I won't steer you wrong.

14:51.959 --> 14:55.334
Anyway, you start
at 7 tomorrow.

14:56.959 --> 14:58.459
Go home.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.584
Those marks...

16:20.417 --> 16:23.001
They're from plastic surgery.

16:25.209 --> 16:26.917
All that's hers...

16:34.376 --> 16:40.751
...are her eyeballs, her ears,
her fingernails...

16:41.417 --> 16:43.626
...and her pussy.

16:46.917 --> 16:49.667
The rest is all fake.

16:52.459 --> 16:55.001
Maybe she's wearing out.

17:02.001 --> 17:03.001
I should go...

17:03.167 --> 17:05.791
Kin-chan!

17:11.834 --> 17:13.001
You have this.

17:13.876 --> 17:16.584
They're rubies. 8 karats.

17:17.876 --> 17:20.791
My late husband bought it for me.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.376
Take good care of it.

17:24.626 --> 17:25.834
I couldn't!

17:27.501 --> 17:30.001
Now you know all this...

17:31.167 --> 17:33.751
...stay with her till the end.

17:36.126 --> 17:39.709
I'm putting Lilico's face
in your hands.

17:41.126 --> 17:44.501
Michiko Hada, 35.

17:45.334 --> 17:46.751
Lilico's assistant.

17:46.917 --> 17:51.001
I know her better than anyone.

17:51.459 --> 17:53.417
I mean, she was...

17:54.876 --> 17:56.876
... so beautiful!

18:10.667 --> 18:14.001
It'll be fine. We'll operate again.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.959
Wonderful!

18:17.751 --> 18:22.917
We are starting a revolution,
creating a new sense of values.

18:24.251 --> 18:25.501
Mama!

18:25.917 --> 18:28.501
I'll have to stop working again!

18:28.751 --> 18:31.042
Don't worry! It'll be fine.

18:31.209 --> 18:34.584
I'll take care of everything.

18:34.751 --> 18:35.959
Lie down over there.

18:36.626 --> 18:38.001
Don't touch me!

18:38.167 --> 18:39.709
If you would.

18:40.917 --> 18:42.001
This way.

18:44.917 --> 18:47.709
Where's the doctor?!

18:47.959 --> 18:50.209
I know you're there!

18:50.501 --> 18:53.334
Come out here!

18:53.501 --> 18:54.417
It's all right!

18:54.542 --> 18:56.917
You have to fix this!

18:57.917 --> 18:58.917
What?

19:02.501 --> 19:05.584
It's Ms Kandagawa.
Her bill's not paid.

19:08.001 --> 19:11.792
After I made her beautiful...

19:13.126 --> 19:17.917
Is she so arrogant as to think
she doesn't need regular treatments?

19:19.501 --> 19:21.292
She should get a job.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.001
Doctor...

19:24.876 --> 19:28.126
Just in case, could we have
something stronger...

19:28.584 --> 19:30.292
...and quicker?

19:37.876 --> 19:39.251
You know how?

19:43.376 --> 19:45.751
All right.

19:49.376 --> 19:54.251
Death always approaches
with silent footsteps.

19:54.501 --> 19:57.876
What a waste!
She was a beautiful girl!

19:59.084 --> 20:01.876
Megumi Otomo, 23.

20:04.334 --> 20:05.751
'Platina Clinic'...

20:05.834 --> 20:08.126
You're working on that, right?

20:08.751 --> 20:10.167
Transplants.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.209
Transplants?

20:14.292 --> 20:18.542
We're told the director and
her ex-husband, a gynaecologist...

20:19.209 --> 20:24.334
...are illegally obtaining organs,
skin, bone, and muscle...

20:24.834 --> 20:29.001
...and transplanting them
for cosmetic surgery.

20:29.584 --> 20:31.251
That's creepy.

20:31.834 --> 20:37.001
Patients need suppressant drugs
for the rest of their lives.

20:38.001 --> 20:43.626
If they can't pay for them any more,
they suffer severe side-effects.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.792
Why do they do it?

20:46.001 --> 20:48.792
A woman gets nowhere
on brains alone.

20:49.001 --> 20:50.792
Brains?

20:51.001 --> 20:53.792
They're young and pretty enough.

20:54.001 --> 20:56.501
Women are greedy.

21:00.709 --> 21:04.334
Me? Kinji Sawanabe,
make-up artist and stylist.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.792
My age? Not telling.

21:08.126 --> 21:09.792
Lilico then?

21:12.501 --> 21:14.542
Well...

21:14.751 --> 21:16.751
That feels good! Yes!

21:17.001 --> 21:18.542
Flying high!

21:18.709 --> 21:20.001
Lift your head!

21:20.084 --> 21:21.417
Leave 'em brain-dead!

21:21.667 --> 21:24.001
OK, great! Great!

21:24.251 --> 21:25.751
More! That's beautiful!

21:26.001 --> 21:27.917
A big fake smile!

21:28.001 --> 21:30.292
Lilico, you're beautiful! Yes!

21:32.001 --> 21:35.751
Every magazine with her on the cover
sold out.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.084
'Sexy Venus'.

21:37.334 --> 21:38.709
'Sexy Venus'.

21:38.751 --> 21:40.251
That was great!

21:41.626 --> 21:43.751
Seven ad contracts.

21:44.667 --> 21:47.001
TV dramas, variety shows...

21:47.209 --> 21:51.709
Our guest today is Lilico,
whose appeal no one can resist.

21:51.959 --> 21:53.001
Hello.

21:54.709 --> 21:58.667
You're on the cover of just about
every fashion magazine there is...

21:58.709 --> 22:03.501
I regard fashion and make-up
as an expression of myself.

22:05.626 --> 22:08.167
She'd even had offers
from Hollywood.

22:10.001 --> 22:12.709
How does it feel being voted...

22:12.959 --> 22:17.001
...the woman that other women
most want to be?

22:17.126 --> 22:20.626
I'm amazed. I can't believe
I was voted number one.

22:22.001 --> 22:26.667
She was everybody's dream girl.
There was nothing she couldn't do.

22:29.292 --> 22:30.376
Beautiful.

22:47.001 --> 22:50.001
She was like something
out of a dream!

22:51.667 --> 22:53.126
That's great!

23:24.167 --> 23:25.584
Pretty!

23:28.001 --> 23:29.001
Very nice!

23:29.042 --> 23:30.126
Great!

24:29.542 --> 24:31.126
Beauty Ice Bar

24:36.001 --> 24:40.501
It's like lately
I'm too tired to sleep.

24:41.001 --> 24:43.167
Are you OK?

24:48.001 --> 24:49.251
It's like...

24:52.001 --> 24:54.751
...whenever they click the shutter...

24:56.001 --> 24:58.417
...my head empties out.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.042
Bigger smile!

25:03.251 --> 25:04.417
Wave the product!

25:04.501 --> 25:06.417
Big smile! Look this way!

25:06.501 --> 25:08.251
Beautiful!

25:08.501 --> 25:09.917
The hair...

25:10.001 --> 25:11.209
Kin-chan...

25:11.376 --> 25:13.001
Stepping in.

25:19.501 --> 25:21.001
Ready.

25:23.917 --> 25:25.001
Here we go.

25:26.042 --> 25:26.959
Smile...

25:27.001 --> 25:28.001
Great!

25:28.042 --> 25:30.876
Beautiful! You got it!

25:31.001 --> 25:32.001
You got it!

25:32.084 --> 25:33.459
Bigger smile.

25:33.501 --> 25:35.917
Smile!

25:36.001 --> 25:36.876
More!

25:37.001 --> 25:38.001
Bigger smile!

25:38.167 --> 25:39.501
Oh, that's great!

25:39.792 --> 25:41.001
Great! More smile.

25:41.167 --> 25:43.001
You got it!

26:03.792 --> 26:05.459
I'm so tired!

26:07.417 --> 26:11.001
Hada, what's on tomorrow?

26:11.209 --> 26:15.792
We're due at Wangan Studio
at 7 a.m.

26:16.001 --> 26:18.876
Then two interviews at the Hyatt.

26:19.001 --> 26:20.959
With photographs.

26:21.001 --> 26:24.667
Then the Kinuta movie studio
at 5.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.417
Nothing after that.

26:32.751 --> 26:34.959
You know, Hada...

26:40.126 --> 26:43.001
...you've got beautiful skin.

26:43.667 --> 26:46.209
Why don't you ever wear make-up?

26:46.417 --> 26:49.626
Try to look pretty sometimes.

26:51.876 --> 26:56.376
Nothing I could do
would make much difference.

26:57.834 --> 26:59.376
And I'm old.

27:01.376 --> 27:03.001
Have this.

27:04.376 --> 27:06.376
Try it sometime.

27:11.001 --> 27:13.001
But watch out.

27:13.834 --> 27:16.126
It's like a drug.

27:19.751 --> 27:22.292
The more you do...

27:23.001 --> 27:24.959
...the more you want.

27:27.251 --> 27:31.334
What's tomorrow?
My head hurts.

27:35.334 --> 27:37.876
That was funny!

27:44.584 --> 27:45.917
Huh?

27:47.334 --> 27:48.917
I hear something.

27:54.542 --> 27:55.876
Hear that?

27:57.959 --> 27:59.667
'Tick tock'...

28:01.292 --> 28:02.292
There.

28:04.667 --> 28:06.292
A clock?

28:09.792 --> 28:11.751
It's over.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.042
All over.

28:17.042 --> 28:19.126
But that's OK.

28:20.667 --> 28:24.001
I knew it'd happen.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.292
Hey...

28:34.792 --> 28:37.584
...do you have a boyfriend?

28:39.834 --> 28:42.626
Yes.

28:44.001 --> 28:45.834
So you do...

28:47.251 --> 28:50.001
You've got Mr Nanbu.

28:50.251 --> 28:51.626
No.

28:53.001 --> 28:55.542
I wish.

28:56.667 --> 28:59.251
But everyone loves you.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.001
Lots of people.

29:02.667 --> 29:06.792
Hundreds, thousands, millions...

29:12.876 --> 29:17.001
But I've never met or talked to
any of them.

29:18.167 --> 29:22.209
And what's there
that they can love?

29:50.167 --> 29:52.167
If I stop being pretty...

29:58.042 --> 30:01.876
If I stop being popular?

30:11.001 --> 30:13.959
Then they'll all leave me.

30:18.001 --> 30:19.459
They'll laugh.

30:28.001 --> 30:30.709
They'll all forget me.

30:32.001 --> 30:34.001
Never!

30:35.042 --> 30:37.876
I was amazed...

30:38.126 --> 30:40.959
...the first time I saw you...

30:41.751 --> 30:47.126
...out on the terrace at the office
smoking a cigarette...

30:48.917 --> 30:51.876
...with the window
like a picture-frame...

30:52.792 --> 30:54.834
...your hair in the wind...

30:55.001 --> 30:57.417
'Beautiful,' I thought.

30:58.084 --> 31:01.792
Was there ever
anyone that beautiful?'

31:37.501 --> 31:39.417
What a laugh!

31:41.834 --> 31:43.042
Over?

31:43.876 --> 31:46.001
That's it?

31:48.292 --> 31:51.042
I won't let that happen!

31:57.001 --> 31:59.626
Do you know what it's like?!

32:03.376 --> 32:05.001
Are you all right?

32:29.001 --> 32:30.334
Hada...

32:32.001 --> 32:34.001
...am I beautiful?

32:38.001 --> 32:39.417
Yes.

32:43.417 --> 32:44.626
Really?

32:47.001 --> 32:49.001
Very beautiful.

32:55.001 --> 32:58.501
You're the only one
who understands me.

33:07.251 --> 33:08.542
Right now...

33:12.542 --> 33:14.334
...I'm very...

33:20.834 --> 33:22.417
...turned on.

33:22.917 --> 33:25.626
I feel all warm down there.

33:55.001 --> 33:57.876
I need you.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.208
Hada...

34:32.501 --> 34:34.001
...will you lick me?

35:42.126 --> 35:46.417
Lilico couldn't do anything
without me.

35:54.667 --> 35:55.292
What?

35:55.792 --> 36:00.917
I'm sorry. There's someone
who insists on seeing you.

36:04.917 --> 36:06.001
Ichimura...

36:12.834 --> 36:13.917
I'm Chikako.

36:16.417 --> 36:18.626
I want to see my sister.

36:25.084 --> 36:26.709
Look, Kin-chan!

36:26.876 --> 36:27.584
What?

36:27.751 --> 36:29.042
Ta-da!

36:29.376 --> 36:31.626
Third finger, left hand...

36:32.001 --> 36:34.459
Let me see that!

36:35.542 --> 36:37.876
It's twice the size of your finger!

36:38.001 --> 36:38.876
What did it cost?

36:39.001 --> 36:41.459
Nice, huh?

36:54.542 --> 36:56.876
From Chikako Hirukoma

36:59.834 --> 37:02.501
Hi, Sis. How are you?

37:02.834 --> 37:06.667
We came to Tokyo
on our school trip.

37:07.542 --> 37:12.501
They said not to,
but I really wanted to see you.

37:13.001 --> 37:15.501
Of course you weren't around.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.667
I got your boss to buy me dinner.

37:19.667 --> 37:24.709
She wouldn't give me your address
or phone number, though.

37:25.834 --> 37:30.167
I copied it out of her day-book
while she was away.

37:30.834 --> 37:32.792
Not nice, huh?

37:33.792 --> 37:37.001
Take care. I'm studying hard.

37:38.292 --> 37:39.459
Chikako.

37:45.126 --> 37:47.792
Hello! It's Hada.

38:06.001 --> 38:10.001
Hello. I'm coming in.

38:22.751 --> 38:24.209
Hello.

38:25.751 --> 38:28.751
I brought these...

38:31.001 --> 38:32.042
What?

38:33.167 --> 38:35.209
Leave when you're done.

38:37.042 --> 38:39.001
You make me sick.

38:41.001 --> 38:44.084
Is there anything else
I can do?

38:46.709 --> 38:51.709
Don't get all puffed up
just 'cause you licked my cunt.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.126
Pervert!

39:32.667 --> 39:37.459
Lilico And Nanbu Heir!

39:37.584 --> 39:39.501
Nights Of Passion!

39:39.667 --> 39:41.001
What's this?

39:42.167 --> 39:43.501
Hada!

39:44.251 --> 39:47.001
How could you let this happen?
You know your job.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.001
I'm sorry!

39:48.084 --> 39:50.959
I wish that helped.

39:51.542 --> 39:54.001
I need a plan.

39:54.334 --> 39:56.876
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

39:57.001 --> 40:01.501
Mess up again and it's hara-kiri.
I've bet my life on this.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.042
Answer.

40:04.459 --> 40:05.626
Yes, ma'am!

40:15.501 --> 40:18.626
Hada got in trouble!

40:20.459 --> 40:25.501
Well done. Thank you
for leaking that.

40:26.917 --> 40:29.334
I'll reward you later.

40:34.417 --> 40:36.501
But first...

40:37.334 --> 40:40.167
...I need another favor.

40:47.834 --> 40:50.584
It's beautiful here!

40:51.584 --> 40:55.084
Lilico gave me this.
Isn't it nice?

40:59.792 --> 41:01.501
Lilico!

41:03.334 --> 41:05.792
Here she is.

41:05.959 --> 41:07.001
Thanks.

41:09.501 --> 41:13.459
Sorry, Hada, but could you
leave us alone for a while?

41:13.542 --> 41:15.042
Sure.

41:15.209 --> 41:17.251
I'll be right over there.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.001
What's going on?

41:28.251 --> 41:32.501
I was up this way,
and I hadn't seen you for ages...

41:33.001 --> 41:36.001
I saw the drama. It was great!

41:36.501 --> 41:39.501
Oh, that...

41:40.376 --> 41:42.001
It was hard.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.792
They can all act.

41:46.501 --> 41:50.084
I'm thinking of quitting.

41:51.501 --> 41:56.501
I can't sing,
and talk shows aren't my thing.

42:03.167 --> 42:04.459
That's pretty.

42:09.501 --> 42:12.876
You need to think about yourself.

42:14.834 --> 42:17.001
Lose weight, get prettier.

42:19.042 --> 42:21.334
You'll be stronger.

42:22.501 --> 42:24.292
Get your eyes fixed.

42:24.459 --> 42:27.001
That takes money.

42:27.084 --> 42:28.292
Money?

42:28.792 --> 42:30.709
I'll send more.

42:33.334 --> 42:36.876
I'm not as strong as you.

42:39.459 --> 42:42.751
That's why you got beautiful.

42:45.834 --> 42:47.459
No, Chikako.

42:50.459 --> 42:53.001
Beauty makes you strong.

43:06.001 --> 43:08.084
You needn't worry.

43:24.751 --> 43:29.001
You've put up with
a lot worse than this.

43:46.376 --> 43:49.042
Remember when you first came here.

43:50.376 --> 43:54.001
No one took any notice of you.

43:55.917 --> 43:58.001
As if you didn't exist.

43:59.167 --> 44:02.042
You were just a lump of meat.

44:03.667 --> 44:07.376
The object of our treatment
is happiness.

44:08.792 --> 44:10.292
The old you...

44:10.376 --> 44:12.376
...is gone, right?

44:13.084 --> 44:15.001
By your own efforts...

44:15.709 --> 44:17.334
...you have obtained...

44:17.792 --> 44:19.626
...the you that you wanted.

44:27.084 --> 44:28.917
See you in two weeks.

44:31.251 --> 44:32.792
Unhook the monitors.

44:39.834 --> 44:43.042
A big hand, everybody...

45:40.251 --> 45:44.542
Lilico is here at last!

45:48.792 --> 45:51.251
What is your beauty secret?

45:52.542 --> 45:55.834
Her beauty is a montage of images.

45:56.251 --> 46:00.459
The sum total of our desires.

46:02.001 --> 46:05.001
I like yoga and pilates.

46:06.001 --> 46:09.001
She beats her wings the way we want...

46:10.542 --> 46:16.501
...even if she can only do that
by losing her own feathers.

46:21.001 --> 46:23.167
Lilico's really gotten to you.

46:23.959 --> 46:27.167
She's fascinating
when you look into it.

46:29.001 --> 46:31.459
Helter skelter.

46:32.876 --> 46:35.042
Total chaos.

46:43.417 --> 46:46.001
She's our wild card.

46:48.001 --> 46:51.667
It's about time we met.

46:55.126 --> 46:59.167
You forgot, didn't you.

46:59.834 --> 47:02.167
What I said.

47:02.959 --> 47:04.001
You speak Japanese?

47:04.167 --> 47:05.584
I'm sorry.

47:05.751 --> 47:09.959
No looks, no brains, no money...
you poor thing!

47:17.042 --> 47:21.376
But Lilico's still pretty as ever.

47:21.501 --> 47:23.126
Good!

47:30.834 --> 47:32.126
You're eating?

47:33.126 --> 47:36.126
You eat too much. Throw it up later.

47:40.001 --> 47:42.667
I'm beat!

47:43.626 --> 47:45.001
Mama...

47:47.001 --> 47:49.001
The money for my family...

47:51.376 --> 47:53.501
Have you been sending it?

47:54.001 --> 47:55.792
Every month.

47:56.001 --> 47:59.584
Chikako says you haven't.

48:01.501 --> 48:05.001
What, you don't trust me?

48:05.501 --> 48:08.542
Maybe it's not as much
as you were thinking...

48:08.709 --> 48:11.584
...but it costs a lot to maintain you.

48:11.834 --> 48:15.084
And I haven't got
my investment back yet.

48:15.334 --> 48:16.376
But still...

48:17.001 --> 48:18.959
I'm hurt.

48:21.042 --> 48:27.459
You were nothing when I found you,
and we've come all this way together.

48:29.501 --> 48:30.417
Yeah, but...

48:30.584 --> 48:33.917
I don't just think of you
as business, you know.

48:36.792 --> 48:41.376
You're my dream,
one that I created.

48:45.001 --> 48:46.042
Excuse me...

48:47.584 --> 48:49.584
Hi, Kozue.

48:50.001 --> 48:52.251
I'll introduce you.

48:52.667 --> 48:54.834
Kozue Yoshikawa, 18.

48:55.001 --> 48:58.334
I don't know why,
but everyone loves her.

48:58.751 --> 49:01.292
We have great hopes for her.

49:01.459 --> 49:04.001
How do you do.

49:04.251 --> 49:08.876
And she's learned how
to introduce herself, too.

49:26.459 --> 49:28.251
Cut! OK!

49:28.459 --> 49:30.001
Thanks very much!

49:39.501 --> 49:40.542
Come over here.

49:42.584 --> 49:44.917
OK, good...

49:45.001 --> 49:47.001
Beautiful! Just like that!

49:48.251 --> 49:50.709
Like you're kissing the camera.

49:50.876 --> 49:52.001
Yes!

49:54.542 --> 49:55.584
Yes!

49:55.709 --> 49:58.459
Perfect!

49:58.584 --> 49:59.376
Yes!

49:59.876 --> 50:05.209
Today's guest is the latest rage,
Kozue Yoshikawa.

50:05.792 --> 50:09.001
You're just so pretty!

50:09.251 --> 50:12.001
And now you're breaking into TV.

50:20.459 --> 50:21.667
Checking.

50:24.001 --> 50:26.001
That gap's perfect.

50:30.959 --> 50:32.709
Move in closer, Kozue.

50:39.292 --> 50:41.292
Good. Thanks.

50:42.001 --> 50:43.584
Thank you.

50:51.417 --> 50:52.876
They're all Kozue.

50:54.001 --> 50:55.001
She's so cute!

50:56.126 --> 50:57.667
How does she do it?

50:57.834 --> 50:58.917
She's taking over.

50:59.001 --> 51:01.001
It's all Kozue.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.001
She's so cute it's not fair!

51:03.334 --> 51:04.626
Look at her skin!

51:30.501 --> 51:33.167
I saw Kozue on the train.

51:33.376 --> 51:36.459
What?! You saw Kozue?

51:38.001 --> 51:39.959
I want to be her!

51:40.001 --> 51:42.792
That'll take real magic!

51:43.542 --> 51:45.334
Lovely!

52:09.001 --> 52:10.917
It's that 'something'.

52:11.001 --> 52:12.959
You're right.

52:38.501 --> 52:43.626
The fame, the money...
I couldn't care less.

52:44.751 --> 52:51.001
What? All the models throw up.
How else do you stay that thin?

52:51.459 --> 52:53.334
You get those people.

52:54.917 --> 52:56.917
They're just born that way.

52:58.042 --> 53:00.459
They're born beautiful.

53:05.334 --> 53:07.292
Why did she get this job?!

53:07.459 --> 53:10.167
You were taking time off...

53:10.334 --> 53:14.251
It could have been anybody,
right?

53:14.917 --> 53:16.751
Why Kozue?!

53:19.876 --> 53:21.876
Lilico! Wait!

53:24.501 --> 53:25.459
Lilico!

53:25.584 --> 53:27.876
Kin-chan! Go after her!

53:28.001 --> 53:29.542
Lilico!

53:33.042 --> 53:35.126
I'm sick of this!

53:35.292 --> 53:37.876
I want to quit!

53:40.709 --> 53:43.876
You don't need me, right?

53:44.084 --> 53:47.001
You don't need me!

53:48.626 --> 53:50.626
I'm sick of it!

53:53.001 --> 53:56.501
I don't want to do this any more!

53:58.751 --> 54:00.209
Silly!

54:00.501 --> 54:04.209
There's no one
who can take your place!

54:04.792 --> 54:08.126
You don't need me!

54:09.584 --> 54:11.626
I don't want to do this!

54:11.792 --> 54:12.834
All right.

54:13.167 --> 54:15.001
Have a sleep.

54:16.001 --> 54:20.126
It was about that time
Lilico started losing the plot.

54:37.751 --> 54:38.626
No?

54:38.792 --> 54:42.626
You're good-looking, you know.

54:43.792 --> 54:45.084
Would you like to act?

54:45.751 --> 54:46.792
No.

54:47.001 --> 54:49.001
About this photograph...

54:49.167 --> 54:52.334
That's me. Where did you find this?

54:53.417 --> 54:56.542
You look exactly like Lilico.

54:56.792 --> 54:59.042
You think so?

54:59.417 --> 55:01.501
Well, if you say so.

55:02.167 --> 55:07.001
Believe it or not, I used to be
not completely untalented.

55:07.751 --> 55:11.667
So Lilico was a replica of you?

55:17.751 --> 55:21.751
What's all this about you
getting engaged?

55:23.001 --> 55:27.001
To a politician's daughter.
Is that true?

55:27.042 --> 55:29.042
Well, you know...

55:31.209 --> 55:34.667
Sorry. I meant to tell you.

55:35.001 --> 55:37.001
You gave me a ring!

55:39.001 --> 55:40.626
It's status.

55:42.709 --> 55:44.584
'Status'?

55:45.167 --> 55:46.626
Come on, now.

55:47.376 --> 55:54.084
There's no way someone like me
can marry someone like you.

55:58.251 --> 55:59.709
Don't get me wrong.

56:00.334 --> 56:03.001
You're the one I like most.

56:04.126 --> 56:06.709
I'll just be married in name.

56:07.709 --> 56:11.001
Why don't you come
on the honeymoon, too?

56:11.667 --> 56:14.042
I'll dump her and we can...

56:54.001 --> 56:55.251
Shin?

56:55.459 --> 56:56.626
Hi.

56:56.876 --> 56:58.042
There you are...

56:58.626 --> 57:03.542
I might not be home for a while.
Buy yourself something to eat.

57:03.626 --> 57:05.001
What's wrong?

57:06.001 --> 57:08.084
Lilico's all messed up.

57:08.417 --> 57:11.001
I have to take her to a hotel.

57:11.292 --> 57:14.626
She can't do anything without me.

57:15.126 --> 57:17.834
Nor can I.

57:18.542 --> 57:20.959
Shin!

57:21.209 --> 57:22.251
I'll see you.

57:22.417 --> 57:24.084
Hey, wait a minute...

57:25.001 --> 57:26.376
No, Shin!

57:26.501 --> 57:28.001
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:30.376 --> 57:32.084
Am I interrupting?

57:32.501 --> 57:33.501
Lilico...

57:40.417 --> 57:43.042
Is this your boyfriend?

57:43.584 --> 57:45.167
Yes.

57:51.542 --> 57:53.001
How do you do.

57:55.001 --> 57:56.251
Hello.

57:56.542 --> 57:58.959
Hada's someone I rely on.

57:59.001 --> 58:00.292
Good.

58:02.251 --> 58:05.126
Your boyfriend's good-looking, Hada.

58:13.792 --> 58:17.042
So these are the lips
that captivate Hada?

58:29.001 --> 58:30.001
Can I...

58:34.459 --> 58:36.001
...kiss you?

58:45.001 --> 58:46.501
You don't mind, do you?

59:13.501 --> 59:14.751
Oh, my!

59:16.084 --> 59:18.501
You're hard as a rock.

59:19.126 --> 59:23.001
What are we going to do?
How can you stand it?

59:24.501 --> 59:26.209
I can't.

59:50.001 --> 59:51.834
Watch, Hada.

59:53.126 --> 59:57.126
I'm going to do something bad
with your boyfriend.

01:01:33.209 --> 01:01:34.584
Michiko

01:01:43.001 --> 01:01:44.334
Hello?

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:49.042
It's me. Lilico.

01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:54.001
I really enjoyed last night.

01:01:55.126 --> 01:01:58.626
Are you busy tonight?

01:02:01.001 --> 01:02:02.876
Let's have some fun.

01:02:10.001 --> 01:02:11.542
Great, huh?

01:02:12.626 --> 01:02:14.292
He's coming over.

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:22.876
Then we're going to make you feel
really good.

01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:29.709
So stop staying
you're going to quit, OK?

01:02:32.876 --> 01:02:34.917
I'll be good.

01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:39.251
I'm going to work real hard.

01:02:40.251 --> 01:02:43.501
I love you, Hada.

01:02:48.584 --> 01:02:51.001
I'm lost without you.

01:02:53.251 --> 01:02:54.751
Cheri? Cheri?

01:03:18.001 --> 01:03:19.042
OK?

01:03:21.209 --> 01:03:22.626
I don't know.

01:03:31.501 --> 01:03:35.167
Shin! Did you do it?

01:03:35.459 --> 01:03:38.001
I don't know! I don't know!

01:03:40.876 --> 01:03:43.751
This is bad. Real bad!

01:03:54.876 --> 01:03:57.709
It's in the papers.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:58.584
Acid Thrown in
Politician's Daughter's Face

01:03:59.167 --> 01:04:01.584
You've done it now.

01:04:02.501 --> 01:04:05.001
I could get you sent to jail.

01:04:05.751 --> 01:04:07.126
Maybe I will.

01:04:07.542 --> 01:04:10.042
You told us to do it!

01:04:10.667 --> 01:04:13.542
I've never met the woman.

01:04:13.876 --> 01:04:19.001
I just said it'd be funny
if you did something like that.

01:04:19.376 --> 01:04:21.709
I never dreamed you would.

01:04:23.501 --> 01:04:25.792
You're finished if it comes out.

01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:28.917
What a laugh!

01:04:34.459 --> 01:04:37.709
I'm just kidding.
You did a great job.

01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:39.376
Thanks.

01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:42.084
I love you both.

01:04:45.834 --> 01:04:50.001
But this has to be our secret.
The three of us.

01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:52.001
OK?

01:04:59.584 --> 01:05:01.376
Here's your reward...

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:30.001
Take your clothes off.

01:05:36.292 --> 01:05:38.709
Hurry it up!

01:05:41.001 --> 01:05:43.792
You're going to do it
in front of me.

01:06:19.959 --> 01:06:22.001
Useless!

01:06:34.501 --> 01:06:37.001
Why don't you fall apart?!

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:10.751
Sink down as far as I have.

01:07:14.792 --> 01:07:17.584
Ayako Kandagawa, 27.

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.334
A patient at that clinic.

01:07:22.001 --> 01:07:22.792
Any note?

01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:27.126
In her bag we found her wallet,
cell phone, and a daily planner...

01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:31.292
...with 'no further'
scrawled the day before.

01:07:34.334 --> 01:07:37.959
Two dead.
This has gone too far.

01:07:39.001 --> 01:07:43.001
What now? We don't have enough
to lay a charge.

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:48.334
It's about time we turned over
our card.

01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:09.001
I want to see you.

01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:10.459
Hello?

01:08:10.584 --> 01:08:12.376
Lilico, please.

01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:14.167
Coming.

01:08:14.751 --> 01:08:16.084
Off you go.

01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:19.001
Does everyone know?

01:08:19.584 --> 01:08:21.001
Not everyone.

01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:26.001
But the blemishes won't go away.

01:08:26.084 --> 01:08:27.292
Blemishes?

01:08:28.001 --> 01:08:29.834
Her skin...

01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:32.126
It's like she's old.

01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:35.292
No elasticity.
It won't bounce back.

01:08:36.126 --> 01:08:39.001
Kana asked if she had a disease.

01:08:40.751 --> 01:08:46.251
We work with our fingertips.
We can tell.

01:08:54.001 --> 01:08:56.209
This might be the end for her.

01:09:08.626 --> 01:09:10.709
You're as pretty as ever.

01:09:14.126 --> 01:09:16.626
I'm glad you changed your mind.

01:09:17.084 --> 01:09:18.959
You sweet-talked me.

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:28.792
How's your fiancÃ©e, anyway?
Is she in any shape for a wedding?

01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:32.334
Forget that woman.

01:09:33.876 --> 01:09:36.417
The only one I love is you.

01:09:51.626 --> 01:09:55.876
Do you think of me
when you're doing it with her?

01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:01.917
No. I think of you
and I jerk off a lot.

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:08.459
Then why marry her?

01:10:12.042 --> 01:10:15.876
It's work,
is how I think of it.

01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:21.084
It was set when I was born
the eldest son.

01:10:23.584 --> 01:10:25.584
I wanted to be a sailor.

01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:28.834
And a musician.

01:10:29.876 --> 01:10:31.876
And an entomologist.

01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:37.376
But I couldn't.

01:10:51.667 --> 01:10:53.417
Why didn't you?

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.626
I couldn't.

01:10:56.542 --> 01:10:57.751
Sure you could.

01:10:57.834 --> 01:10:59.167
No way.

01:11:01.001 --> 01:11:03.792
All you had to do was try.

01:11:05.459 --> 01:11:10.501
Instead you gave up without trying
and now you feel sorry for yourself.

01:11:13.834 --> 01:11:16.667
Life is what you decide it is.

01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:25.709
It's true. The one who decides
is you.

01:11:36.084 --> 01:11:39.459
The doctor says
she's too busy to talk to us.

01:11:39.792 --> 01:11:44.667
And upstairs won't issue a warrant
so we can subpoena her.

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:48.334
You know who her patients are?

01:11:49.042 --> 01:11:52.001
They're not all actors and models.

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:58.751
They're mostly the children of
businessmen and politicians.

01:12:00.209 --> 01:12:04.084
Thus the iron curtain
protecting them?

01:12:05.459 --> 01:12:09.001
And the doctor thinks
she can tell us to get lost.

01:12:10.251 --> 01:12:13.501
But we have a trump card.

01:12:16.001 --> 01:12:17.001
Let's go see...

01:12:17.751 --> 01:12:21.417
...the ferocious Princess Tiger Lily.

01:12:48.084 --> 01:12:49.292
And cut!

01:12:49.959 --> 01:12:52.001
30 minutes for set change.

01:12:52.042 --> 01:12:53.001
Back at 2!

01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:43.001
We meet at last, Tiger Lily.

01:13:45.584 --> 01:13:47.459
I'm a fan.

01:13:56.626 --> 01:13:58.001
'Prosecutor'?

01:14:02.251 --> 01:14:08.251
'Tiger Lily'? What do you mean?
Don't make up names for me.

01:14:09.376 --> 01:14:14.126
A beautiful adventuress.
You are definitely Tiger Lily.

01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:19.584
Mister...

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:24.959
...what would you know about me?

01:14:27.542 --> 01:14:33.542
I'm here to ask you to be
a witness in court.

01:14:35.584 --> 01:14:37.001
About what?

01:14:38.459 --> 01:14:41.001
The beauty clinic you use.

01:14:42.501 --> 01:14:46.001
I'm sure you're aware
what they do is illegal?

01:14:48.334 --> 01:14:50.001
Beauty...

01:14:51.376 --> 01:14:56.292
They take advantage of
women obsessing over it.

01:14:57.417 --> 01:14:59.542
They do evil things.

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:10.001
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sorry, I'm not very bright.

01:15:13.167 --> 01:15:16.209
You don't seem to be
a very good liar.

01:15:24.376 --> 01:15:26.417
Can you tell what the lie is?

01:15:28.501 --> 01:15:32.167
Yes. I understand you.

01:15:36.334 --> 01:15:40.084
You're scattering feathers,
trying to please everyone.

01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:47.792
I know that desire of yours
better than anyone.

01:15:52.501 --> 01:15:55.876
I'm sorry we had to meet
in these circumstances.

01:16:30.001 --> 01:16:32.251
If not 'Tiger Lily', how about...

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:36.292
...'Ms Hirukoma'?

01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:50.667
When I saw your old pictures
I thought of 'Tiger Lily's Adventure'.

01:16:54.959 --> 01:16:57.459
You're in the middle of it now.

01:16:59.959 --> 01:17:05.834
It took courage to leave a small town
and make it this far.

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:12.417
Courage is beautiful.

01:17:16.417 --> 01:17:17.417
You'll be fine.

01:17:19.376 --> 01:17:21.084
You're beautiful.

01:17:23.167 --> 01:17:24.334
Stop it!

01:17:31.042 --> 01:17:35.917
But you shouldn't have used
your own van.

01:17:37.376 --> 01:17:38.376
Van?

01:17:39.001 --> 01:17:41.709
What did you have Michiko Hada

01:17:41.792 --> 01:17:44.751
and Shin Okamura do ten days ago?

01:17:46.626 --> 01:17:47.917
Meaning?

01:17:48.001 --> 01:17:53.876
There was a van parked nearby.
We have its license number.

01:17:55.126 --> 01:17:58.167
And a witness, I'm afraid.

01:18:01.084 --> 01:18:06.292
I've never been to any clinic,
and I have nothing to do with one.

01:18:06.376 --> 01:18:09.584
Hada's my assistant, that's all.

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:12.001
I've never met that guy.

01:18:12.751 --> 01:18:14.334
This is crazy!

01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:20.334
All right.
Let's leave it at that for today.

01:18:21.917 --> 01:18:26.626
But we need your testimony.

01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:33.001
You are Ariadne's ball of thread.

01:18:41.292 --> 01:18:46.292
This is what makes us suspicious
of that clinic.

01:18:47.292 --> 01:18:49.001
Look at it.

01:18:57.001 --> 01:19:01.792
So that no more women
fall into the same deep pit.

01:19:04.501 --> 01:19:05.709
Excuse me.

01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:28.751
A deep pit...

01:20:30.834 --> 01:20:33.042
I'm already in one.

01:21:00.126 --> 01:21:03.792
Lilico? The pot-au-feu's ready.

01:21:10.001 --> 01:21:11.376
Beauty Ice Bar

01:21:12.751 --> 01:21:14.084
For more...

01:21:15.126 --> 01:21:16.709
...than 'cute'...

01:21:17.959 --> 01:21:19.126
...or 'pretty'...

01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:22.001
Beauty Ice Bar

01:21:34.001 --> 01:21:35.417
Hada...

01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:38.084
Hada?

01:21:41.084 --> 01:21:42.084
Hada!

01:21:42.501 --> 01:21:44.084
Yes?

01:21:49.584 --> 01:21:53.334
Hada... do you love me?

01:21:59.459 --> 01:22:02.584
Then destroy her face.

01:22:05.376 --> 01:22:08.667
Carve it wide open.

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:12.042
She makes me sick.

01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:03.876
Good!

01:23:05.459 --> 01:23:07.501
Break for lunch!

01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:09.001
Thank you.

01:23:13.292 --> 01:23:16.959
Today we have two amazing guests...

01:23:17.001 --> 01:23:19.209
...Lilico, and Anna Ishibashi!

01:23:19.751 --> 01:23:22.001
Hello.

01:23:23.584 --> 01:23:26.376
Now I'm into making macaroons.

01:23:27.209 --> 01:23:28.459
Macaroni?

01:23:28.584 --> 01:23:30.001
No!

01:23:30.834 --> 01:23:34.501
I always get them mixed up.

01:23:54.917 --> 01:23:56.292
Today is...

01:23:56.542 --> 01:23:58.001
...Lilico's birthday!

01:24:00.292 --> 01:24:03.542
And here comes the birthday cake!

01:24:13.209 --> 01:24:15.001
Happy birthday!

01:24:16.501 --> 01:24:20.001
Happy birthday!

01:24:29.501 --> 01:24:33.001
Happy birthday!

01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:38.709
Happy birthday!

01:26:27.042 --> 01:26:30.501
I don't care. Do it.

01:26:43.917 --> 01:26:46.834
Call someone! Anyone!

01:27:29.834 --> 01:27:36.084
We'll be forgotten. We're machines
for the processing of desires.

01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:41.834
'Pretty!' 'Wow!'
'That's what I want to be!'

01:27:43.626 --> 01:27:45.959
Desire doesn't care.

01:27:46.459 --> 01:27:49.292
It just keeps on with another name
and another face.

01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:06.001
More beautiful...

01:29:07.584 --> 01:29:09.001
More...

01:29:11.292 --> 01:29:13.251
More...

01:29:18.751 --> 01:29:20.417
You're used up.

01:29:23.001 --> 01:29:25.667
Are you OK? Lilico?

01:29:40.334 --> 01:29:41.709
My head hurts!

01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:49.709
Where's my cell?

01:29:59.959 --> 01:30:03.001
Hello, Lilico? Are you OK?

01:30:05.376 --> 01:30:10.001
Like I was saying,
why don't you take some time off?

01:30:12.667 --> 01:30:14.001
Hello?

01:30:15.251 --> 01:30:18.542
I feel responsible...

01:30:31.501 --> 01:30:34.001
Lilico? Lilico?

01:30:37.626 --> 01:30:39.459
Are you OK?

01:30:48.626 --> 01:30:50.251
Kozue...

01:30:53.917 --> 01:30:55.959
You couldn't do it, right?

01:30:57.001 --> 01:31:00.126
What good are you, anyway?!

01:31:02.376 --> 01:31:05.001
What happens to me now?

01:31:06.334 --> 01:31:08.459
I won't get any work!

01:31:09.251 --> 01:31:11.834
They'll all forget me!

01:31:13.584 --> 01:31:15.584
You'll all go away.

01:31:17.584 --> 01:31:22.001
Being forgotten... that's like dying!

01:31:22.209 --> 01:31:25.001
I'm going to die!

01:31:25.042 --> 01:31:27.876
You're not going to die!

01:31:28.542 --> 01:31:30.001
Oh, shut up!

01:31:30.209 --> 01:31:32.001
It'll be OK!

01:31:32.584 --> 01:31:36.334
You'll be fine.
I'll be here with you.

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:41.501
How would you know
how it feels?!

01:31:42.542 --> 01:31:44.167
Let go of me!

01:34:36.001 --> 01:34:42.001
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest of them all?

01:37:12.584 --> 01:37:15.001
Hello! I'm from Nice Post...

01:37:17.001 --> 01:37:19.792
Lilico, I'm from Wake Up magazine...

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:23.167
We've received
a very surprising letter.

01:37:23.501 --> 01:37:27.001
Is it true you've had
full-body cosmetic surgery?

01:37:27.126 --> 01:37:29.751
Did you work in the sex trade?

01:37:29.917 --> 01:37:33.084
Did you know that clinic
was breaking the law?

01:37:33.417 --> 01:37:35.167
Give us a statement!

01:37:35.501 --> 01:37:39.167
You're there, aren't you.
Could we have a comment...

01:38:06.001 --> 01:38:07.376
It's like...

01:38:10.126 --> 01:38:13.626
...I'm going to
make them all happy again.

01:38:25.917 --> 01:38:27.709
Can you believe this?!

01:38:27.876 --> 01:38:29.376
Uh-oh...

01:38:30.001 --> 01:38:31.001
Surgery!

01:38:31.042 --> 01:38:32.084
Wow!

01:38:33.084 --> 01:38:34.334
She's a fake!

01:38:34.501 --> 01:38:36.001
Incredible!

01:38:37.876 --> 01:38:40.001
I feel cheated!

01:38:47.001 --> 01:38:50.542
'Perfect style', and it's all fake!

01:38:52.084 --> 01:38:54.001
This is bad!

01:38:56.001 --> 01:38:57.417
This is big!

01:39:08.376 --> 01:39:10.334
No way!

01:39:12.001 --> 01:39:14.501
She was a fat little hooker!

01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:17.042
Oh, yuck!

01:39:17.376 --> 01:39:18.542
What a pig!

01:39:20.001 --> 01:39:21.334
From a pig barn!

01:39:21.751 --> 01:39:23.334
Pure pork!

01:39:32.001 --> 01:39:34.251
That's the end of Lilico, right?

01:39:36.001 --> 01:39:38.501
Anyone could do that!

01:39:38.626 --> 01:39:39.959
Eat that, will you?

01:39:40.001 --> 01:39:42.959
Lilico! Lilico! Lilico!

01:39:44.501 --> 01:39:48.542
That clinic Lilico went to
looks pretty sleazy.

01:39:49.001 --> 01:39:50.459
Baby parts...

01:39:50.876 --> 01:39:52.251
Placentas!

01:39:54.459 --> 01:39:56.709
That's how she got like this?

01:39:57.501 --> 01:39:59.709
This I want to know!

01:40:05.001 --> 01:40:07.001
What did Lilico get?

01:40:11.001 --> 01:40:11.917
Search.

01:40:12.001 --> 01:40:13.459
Where's your cell?

01:40:14.001 --> 01:40:16.376
Check it out on your cell.

01:42:14.334 --> 01:42:16.167
This is serious!

01:42:16.376 --> 01:42:17.501
I know, sir.

01:42:17.959 --> 01:42:22.959
Our information was leaked,
and it's started a media frenzy.

01:42:23.001 --> 01:42:26.667
I was in charge.
I will take responsibility.

01:42:32.334 --> 01:42:37.292
You are suspended from duty
till further notice.

01:42:38.084 --> 01:42:39.251
I understand.

01:42:55.751 --> 01:42:57.376
Did you leak that?

01:42:58.834 --> 01:43:00.501
Turning over your card?

01:43:02.251 --> 01:43:05.084
The law is just rules people work out.

01:43:06.584 --> 01:43:09.292
With emotional questions of good,
or bad...

01:43:10.376 --> 01:43:13.959
...only the brave adventurer
rises above it.

01:43:15.876 --> 01:43:18.209
And it's always at a crossroads.

01:43:19.959 --> 01:43:22.501
We're at a crossroads?

01:43:24.001 --> 01:43:27.334
From now on
we're up against the powerful.

01:43:28.542 --> 01:43:30.042
It'll be a long war.

01:43:37.292 --> 01:43:38.584
And...

01:43:40.501 --> 01:43:43.501
...you can only play
your wild card once.

01:43:46.667 --> 01:43:48.709
You played your trump.

01:43:51.334 --> 01:43:53.459
With regret.

01:44:02.251 --> 01:44:05.209
It was the best job of my life.

01:44:15.459 --> 01:44:19.834
I got my lawyer
to write you a script.

01:44:19.876 --> 01:44:23.876
The writer's changed it
to sound like you.

01:44:24.501 --> 01:44:29.876
Memorize every word of it,
and don't say anything else.

01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:39.001
Mama...

01:44:40.584 --> 01:44:43.001
...have I made you money?

01:44:43.834 --> 01:44:45.459
Or not?

01:44:48.834 --> 01:44:51.792
I'm way in the red!

01:44:51.834 --> 01:44:56.667
My models are quitting,
our bookings are cancelled...

01:45:06.084 --> 01:45:09.001
But I'll take responsibility.

01:45:10.542 --> 01:45:13.417
I created you, after all.

01:45:27.292 --> 01:45:28.334
Mama...

01:45:36.001 --> 01:45:36.792
Yes?

01:45:37.042 --> 01:45:38.209
Excuse me!

01:45:39.292 --> 01:45:40.417
Kin-chan...

01:45:43.167 --> 01:45:45.292
...cover up those marks.

01:45:46.001 --> 01:45:47.209
Please.

01:46:03.001 --> 01:46:04.459
I'm sorry.

01:46:04.584 --> 01:46:06.501
For what?

01:46:10.751 --> 01:46:13.751
I practically need
special-effects make-up.

01:46:14.334 --> 01:46:15.751
Yeah?

01:46:16.584 --> 01:46:20.501
Then I could work
with Michael Jackson.

01:46:22.209 --> 01:46:24.001
He's dead.

01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:27.126
But you're alive.

01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:40.584
My head hurts.

01:46:41.251 --> 01:46:42.292
You OK?

01:46:43.542 --> 01:46:44.959
Have some water.

01:46:56.292 --> 01:46:58.459
I'm glad I worked with her.

01:47:02.667 --> 01:47:04.667
She was my pride and joy.

01:47:18.001 --> 01:47:19.959
There.

01:47:21.917 --> 01:47:23.917
You can't live without me.

01:48:50.251 --> 01:48:52.292
Hi, Tiger Lily.

01:48:56.251 --> 01:48:57.292
You're doing it?

01:49:02.292 --> 01:49:03.292
Sure.

01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:08.167
I'm going to carry this off.

01:49:10.876 --> 01:49:12.917
I'll show them what they want.

01:49:16.209 --> 01:49:19.251
There's no need
to harm your feathers any more.

01:49:21.251 --> 01:49:24.251
Your service to everyone
will be wasted.

01:49:26.167 --> 01:49:28.251
In 15 minutes they'll forget.

01:49:30.167 --> 01:49:32.209
They have their own concerns.

01:49:36.209 --> 01:49:37.209
That's right.

01:49:40.626 --> 01:49:42.876
There's no one who loves me.

01:49:45.167 --> 01:49:47.209
No one who needs me.

01:49:52.167 --> 01:49:57.126
So I decide, and I destroy myself.

01:50:17.126 --> 01:50:22.126
Thank you for taking time
from your busy schedules today.

01:50:22.167 --> 01:50:26.084
Lilico, a model who works
through our agency...

01:50:27.084 --> 01:50:31.084
...will make a sincere statement
of her feelings...

01:50:31.126 --> 01:50:34.084
...concerning certain recent reports.

01:50:34.126 --> 01:50:38.084
I beg your indulgence
in hearing her.

01:50:39.167 --> 01:50:41.167
Lilico, you can start.

01:54:14.876 --> 01:54:17.917
I have nothing to say
about that woman.

01:54:20.834 --> 01:54:21.834
Lilico!

01:54:21.917 --> 01:54:24.876
She was over.
She was desperate.

01:54:25.876 --> 01:54:29.876
It was incredible!
Then it was, like, 'uh-oh...'

01:54:29.917 --> 01:54:32.876
How is anyone that driven?

01:54:34.917 --> 01:54:36.917
I mentored her...

01:54:41.876 --> 01:54:42.876
Well...

01:54:43.917 --> 01:54:45.834
...things happen.

01:54:47.876 --> 01:54:50.792
I loved that girl.

01:54:51.792 --> 01:54:52.834
Did you hear?

01:54:52.876 --> 01:54:55.209
They say there was no Lilico.

01:54:55.251 --> 01:54:56.376
What?!

01:54:56.792 --> 01:54:57.751
It was like CG.

01:54:57.834 --> 01:55:00.792
She died... I mean, she was dead.

01:55:00.834 --> 01:55:02.834
Then she came back.

01:55:04.876 --> 01:55:09.834
Put her picture on your cell phone
and your eyes get bigger.

01:55:10.876 --> 01:55:14.876
I put her picture under my pillow
when I went to sleep.

01:55:15.792 --> 01:55:16.876
It cured my pimples!

01:55:18.751 --> 01:55:21.751
Putting Lilico on your cell phone
is a bit much.

01:55:21.834 --> 01:55:22.792
Yeah...

01:55:22.834 --> 01:55:24.792
She had surgery.

01:55:27.792 --> 01:55:31.792
What if you wake up
and your face is gone?

01:55:34.751 --> 01:55:38.751
Could I lose weight and then wake up
and be like her?

01:55:41.792 --> 01:55:43.792
She's cute!

01:55:44.834 --> 01:55:46.709
Where's that from?

01:55:46.792 --> 01:55:48.834
A used-clothing place.

01:56:57.167 --> 01:56:58.626
Mr Asada!

01:56:58.709 --> 01:57:00.626
It's me!

01:57:01.709 --> 01:57:05.667
A lot of things
happened back then...

01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:08.667
...but I always wanted to see you.

01:57:11.667 --> 01:57:12.542
Reina!

01:57:12.626 --> 01:57:13.626
Coming!

01:57:13.667 --> 01:57:15.709
This is where I am...

01:57:17.626 --> 01:57:18.667
...right now.

01:57:19.667 --> 01:57:22.667
Come and see me if you like.

01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:26.626
Sorry!

01:57:37.626 --> 01:57:38.626
Who was that?

01:57:40.667 --> 01:57:42.667
Lilico's sister.

01:57:44.667 --> 01:57:46.667
Chikako Hirukoma?

01:57:47.584 --> 01:57:49.626
Little Tiger Lily.

01:57:54.626 --> 01:57:57.667
Today's our 16th hearing.

01:57:59.584 --> 01:58:00.667
It's not over.

01:58:01.667 --> 01:58:06.584
156 patients have filed suit
against the clinic.

01:58:06.667 --> 01:58:11.542
There've been nine suicides,
and at least one missing.

01:58:12.542 --> 01:58:13.584
Lilico...

01:58:15.584 --> 01:58:18.584
Little Tiger Lilies everywhere.

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:22.584
Young, glittering...

01:58:24.626 --> 01:58:28.626
But everyone knows
one day it has to end.

01:58:31.584 --> 01:58:36.584
Why do the gods give us
youth and beauty...

01:58:37.626 --> 01:58:39.584
...then take them away?

01:58:41.501 --> 01:58:42.542
They're not the same.

01:58:43.542 --> 01:58:47.542
Youth is beautiful,
but beauty isn't youth.

01:58:48.584 --> 01:58:53.584
It's more complicated,
packed full of other things.

01:58:58.501 --> 01:58:59.584
But Lilico...

01:59:00.542 --> 01:59:01.584
Was a success.

01:59:03.542 --> 01:59:05.584
See? She's smiling.

01:59:08.542 --> 01:59:15.501
'The Legend of Lilico'
Now on Sale!

01:59:17.542 --> 01:59:19.459
Tiger Lily...

01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:24.542
Your adventure goes on... forever.

01:59:28.459 --> 01:59:29.542
Let's move.

01:59:56.459 --> 02:00:00.376
Yeah, that was great!
Fits right in with the neon!

02:00:00.459 --> 02:00:02.417
Great, Kozue!

02:00:02.459 --> 02:00:03.459
Just like that! Yes!

02:00:03.501 --> 02:00:04.501
Last one.

02:00:05.501 --> 02:00:08.417
OK! Thank you.

02:00:08.459 --> 02:00:11.417
Thanks a lot.

02:00:12.417 --> 02:00:13.417
Thanks.

02:00:13.501 --> 02:00:15.417
Kin-chan, thanks.

02:00:15.501 --> 02:00:17.501
You were great, Kozue!

02:00:18.459 --> 02:00:20.376
Party! Champagne!

02:00:20.459 --> 02:00:21.501
Yeah!

02:00:23.417 --> 02:00:27.334
I hear we're going to
a very interesting club.

02:00:27.417 --> 02:00:28.376
Yeah?

02:00:28.459 --> 02:00:30.417
With a bad show.

02:01:03.501 --> 02:01:04.626
Here.

02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:05.626
Thank you!

02:01:05.709 --> 02:01:06.751
Good job!

02:01:07.417 --> 02:01:10.417
