21:36.929 --> 21:38.328
<i>Kim: Five minutes to air.</i>

21:38.397 --> 21:41.230
<i>First team in the studio,
please. Five minutes.</i>

21:41.300 --> 21:42.392
<i>Natalie:
Well, I've heard the rumor.</i>

21:42.468 --> 21:43.526
<i>Jeremy:
And I've heard the rumor.</i>

21:43.602 --> 21:44.501
-- <i>That's two...that's three.</i>
-- <i>Plus Kim.</i>

21:44.570 --> 21:45.833
Three people
have heard the rumor.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.430
So I think we're justified
in being nervous.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.099
I think we're justified
in being damn nervous,

21:49.175 --> 21:50.734
and I'm somebody
who can be, frankly, nervous

21:50.810 --> 21:52.175
-- without much justification at all.
-- I know.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.643
-- Elliott, have you heard the rumor?
-- Yes, I have.

21:53.712 --> 21:54.941
That's four.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.140
That's four people we know
who've heard the rumor.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.341
And that's only counting the people
we know who've heard the rumor.

21:57.416 --> 21:58.349
That's right.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.283
What exactly
does a ratings expert do?

22:00.352 --> 22:02.150
Well, presumably,
he raises ratings.

22:02.221 --> 22:04.815
-- What's wrong with our ratings?
-- Our ratings are fine.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.255
-- We come in third.
-- Consistently.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.054
-- Damn straight. -- We come
in third each and every week.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.561
The only way
we could possibly do better

22:09.628 --> 22:11.426
-- is if we came in first or second.
-- That's right.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.864
-- It's not like we're those clowns
in fourth. -- Bunch of losers.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.628
I honestly don't see
the logic in hiring someone

22:15.701 --> 22:17.897
to come in here and shake things
up in order to gain share points

22:17.970 --> 22:19.597
when our ratings
are perfectly fine.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.004
-- It's illogical. -- And yet
four people have heard the rumor.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.509
-- You guys hear about the ratings guy?
-- A full five people now.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.510
-- <i>Good show.</i>
-- Good show!

22:25.578 --> 22:26.545
I'm a little worked up
about this.

22:26.612 --> 22:27.545
-- As well you should be.
-- As well should we all.

22:27.613 --> 22:30.412
[Knock on door]
Come in.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.973
-- Hi.
-- Hello.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.314
-- What's up?
-- Dana, what are you wearing?

22:33.385 --> 22:35.911
-- Do you like it?
-- As a matter of fact, I do.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.252
Tell me something. Why would
the nickel back have set up

22:38.324 --> 22:41.817
5 yards off the line on
third and one inside the 50

22:41.894 --> 22:43.259
and they've been going
off tackle all day?

22:43.329 --> 22:45.764
<i>Well, you have to figure --
Excuse me, Dana.</i>

22:45.831 --> 22:48.766
Sweetie, Dana can tell when
you're staring at her breasts.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.802
-- I <i>wasn't.</i>
-- <i>It's okay.</i>

22:50.870 --> 22:54.864
-- I mean, my eyes naturally went there, but
now I'm fine. -- Why are you wearing that?

22:54.940 --> 22:56.237
I assume after the show
you're going directly

22:56.308 --> 22:57.366
to an important
business meeting.

22:57.443 --> 22:58.740
She's going
to a bachelorette party.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.210
Why are you wearing
those clothes?

23:00.279 --> 23:03.146
-- The bachelorette party is biker-themed.
-- It's biker-themed?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.808
It's biker-themed.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.683
We're all being picked up and
escorted to the party on Harleys.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.881
-- I'm going to ride on the
back of a hog. -- Yeah?

23:09.955 --> 23:12.287
-- I know the lingo. -- Listen,
have you heard the rumor?

23:12.358 --> 23:13.621
-- About the ratings guy?
-- Is it true?

23:13.692 --> 23:15.126
-- No. -- No, you haven't
heard the rumor?

23:15.194 --> 23:17.128
Yes, I've heard the rumor.
No, it isn't true.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.857
-- Really?
-- There's no ratings guy.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.421
Five people
have heard the rumor.

23:20.499 --> 23:21.591
Five people are wrong.

23:21.667 --> 23:24.329
-- Show me San Diego. Show me Oakland.
-- <i>Three</i> minutes <i>out.</i>

23:24.403 --> 23:26.303
Loading animation
one through five.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.272
-- <i>Loading sound 5.</i>
-- <i>Chyr0n's clear on 60?</i>

23:28.340 --> 23:29.774
-- It's clearing.
-- Oakland's up.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.776
Thank you, Dave.
Stop looking at my ass.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.108
No problem.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.547
My point is that it can't be
any old first date.

23:36.615 --> 23:40.483
The bar here is very high, not so much
because it'll be my first date with Dana,

23:40.553 --> 23:42.851
but because it'll be
Dana's first date with me,

23:42.922 --> 23:45.186
and I'm known in some parts
for my first date.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.884
In certain parts,
I have a rep.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.087
There's such a thing
as street cred. Dan...

23:49.161 --> 23:50.287
Listen to this.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.557
Tell them
about my street cred.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.292
-- [Laughs] Seriously...
-- Tell them about my rep.

23:54.366 --> 23:55.492
You don't have a rep.
You don't have street cred.

23:55.568 --> 23:56.626
Your last date
was 14 years ago,

23:56.702 --> 23:59.262
and you ended up with
a marriage and a divorce.

23:59.338 --> 24:00.965
Oh, in some parts --

24:01.040 --> 24:02.667
No, there are no parts.
Now, listen to this.

24:02.741 --> 24:05.802
<i>Dave: Two minutes to VTR.</i>
-- I <i>just</i> hung <i>up the</i> phone.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.141
What's the best news
I could have?

24:07.213 --> 24:09.147
You won a 4-week vacation
to someplace else?

24:09.215 --> 24:11.240
The best news I could have
for me.

24:11.317 --> 24:14.184
You got invited to Hillary
Clinton's fund-raising breakfast.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.587
I got invited to Hillary Clinton's
fund-raising breakfast --

24:17.656 --> 24:19.055
me, the first lady,

24:19.124 --> 24:21.024
scrambled eggs,
lively conversation.

24:21.093 --> 24:24.358
It turns out it wasn't that hard.
You know what you have to do?

24:24.430 --> 24:27.195
-- Write a check for $1,000?
-- That's right.

24:27.266 --> 24:31.032
But not everyone was given
that opportunity. I was asked.

24:31.103 --> 24:34.038
<i>They asked you for $1,000,
and you gave it to them.</i>

24:34.106 --> 24:35.631
That's incredible, Danny.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.767
I was picked, Casey.
I was identified.

24:37.843 --> 24:39.641
Yes, it's called
"being a mark."

24:39.712 --> 24:41.510
I gladly gave my money
to a good fight.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.605
Danny, Isaac's got enough to deal
with from the network right now

24:43.682 --> 24:45.411
without you getting
into a good fight.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.215
-- This isn't about politics. --
She's running for the Senate.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.652
This is about me...

24:49.722 --> 24:52.214
Ms. Hillary Rodham
of Chicago,

24:52.291 --> 24:53.690
and a connection.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.659
There'll be a connection?

24:55.728 --> 24:57.218
I believe there will be.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.162
This really isn't
political, is it?

24:59.231 --> 25:00.858
No, sir, it is not.

25:00.933 --> 25:04.062
<i>You have a crush
on Hillary Clinton.</i>

25:04.136 --> 25:05.729
I carry a torch
for her, yes.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.738
You're hot for Mrs. Clinton.

25:07.806 --> 25:09.638
Well, I mean, who isn't?

25:09.708 --> 25:11.938
But, in my case, it's more than physical.
It's cerebral.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.446
No doubt about it. I think we need
to get you a C.A.T. scan, and stat.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.776
<i>I would like to have
an intelligent,</i>

25:15.848 --> 25:18.476
high-minded, right-thinking,
socially progressive,

25:18.550 --> 25:21.713
impressively pragmatic
conversation with Hillary Clinton.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.721
[Stomps foot]
Tomorrow morning I shall.

25:23.789 --> 25:24.881
Shall you?

25:24.957 --> 25:27.392
Yes, and she will say,
"My goodness.

25:27.459 --> 25:30.053
"That Dan Rydell is
such a bright young boy --

25:30.129 --> 25:33.394
"so much more than
sports scores and highlights.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.934
I think I'll make him
my gentleman friend."

25:36.001 --> 25:38.629
Dave: Rolf <i>VTR.</i> -- VVell, then,
here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.036
<i>-- 60 seconds live. -- What
kind of world do we live in</i>

25:41.106 --> 25:43.473
when third place isn't almost
as good as second place?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.601
-- Jeremy... -- The rumors
are undeniable, Dana.

25:45.678 --> 25:48.613
-- No, they're not undeniable. I'm
denying them. -- Do the <i>count</i> again.

25:48.681 --> 25:51.275
-- Natalie and me -- that's two.
-- Don't do the count.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.114
Kim and Elliott --
that's four. Casey and Dan.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.311
-- That's six.
-- Thanks.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.376
Will, Chris, and Dave --

25:55.454 --> 25:58.321
-- I'm just doing this in my head,
but that's nine, right? -- Yes.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.324
Isaac, good, you're here.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.520
What are you dressed as?

26:02.594 --> 26:06.053
I'm going to a bachelorette party.
It's a theme bachelorette party.

26:06.131 --> 26:09.157
-- Ask her what the theme is. --
I just assumed it was hookers.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.225
It's biker chicks.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.533
-- <i>Just as</i> good <i>in</i> my book.
-- <i>30 seconds live.</i>

26:13.605 --> 26:15.733
-- Isaac, tell these people, would you?
-- Tell them what?

26:15.808 --> 26:16.969
Tell them the rumor
isn't true.

26:17.042 --> 26:20.569
Tell them there isn't a ratings
expert coming in to work on the show.

26:20.646 --> 26:21.875
The rumor <i>is</i> true.

26:22.948 --> 26:26.646
There <i>is</i> a ratings expert coming to work
on the show, and he's coming tomorrow.

26:26.719 --> 26:29.211
The network
hired a ratings guy?

26:29.288 --> 26:32.189
The network didn't hire him.
I did.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.282
Dana, this may not be
the right time,

26:34.393 --> 26:36.361
but that's 10.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.454
In 3...2...

26:38.530 --> 26:39.759
Good evening.
From New York City,

26:39.832 --> 26:42.267
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.268
<i>Those stories, plus we'll
take you around the NHL,</i>

26:44.336 --> 26:47.567
<i>where the Red Wings did some
damage to the duck pond,</i>

26:47.639 --> 26:49.300
and we'll take you
around the NFL,

26:49.375 --> 26:51.844
where the Dolphins did
some damage to themselves.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.344
All that coming up after this.

26:53.412 --> 26:56.347
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.076
<i>Dave." We're out.</i>

26:58.150 --> 27:00.050
Ever been
on a carriage ride?

27:00.119 --> 27:02.588
What do you think
I should wear tomorrow?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.393
<i>Natalie: You know nothing
about the ratings guy?</i>

27:09.461 --> 27:11.122
I know the exact same thing
you know.

27:11.196 --> 27:12.391
I know Isaac is in meetings,

27:12.464 --> 27:14.091
and he'll talk to us
about it later.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.361
My question is where's Dana?

27:15.434 --> 27:16.731
-- I'm back.
-- How was it?

27:16.802 --> 27:17.735
Fantastic.

27:17.803 --> 27:18.770
Good scrambled eggs?

27:18.837 --> 27:20.669
-- Excellent scrambled eggs.
-- Connection?

27:20.739 --> 27:22.537
Connection made,
my young friend.

27:22.608 --> 27:24.975
-- Does anybody care if I'm not part of
this? -- It's just as well, Natalie.

27:25.043 --> 27:26.477
There are gonna be some parts
of this story

27:26.545 --> 27:27.842
that are unsuitable
for mixed company.

27:27.913 --> 27:30.041
-- I have to edit tape.
-- Where did you say Dana was?

27:30.115 --> 27:32.447
She was up all night. And she called
and said she'd be in an hour late.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.008
She was skanking around town
all leathered up?

27:34.086 --> 27:35.019
-- <i>I guess</i> so.
-- Excellent.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.054
Hey, you're talking

27:36.088 --> 27:37.021
about the woman

27:37.089 --> 27:38.147
whose first date with me

27:38.223 --> 27:39.156
I'm planning.

27:39.224 --> 27:40.919
That was some pretty
interesting grammar.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.825
See you at the rundown.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.364
Casey, it was the best
breakfast of my life.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.525
For a thousand bucks,
I imagine it'd be up there.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.330
I was introduced to her.
She held out her hand.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.268
Hillary Clinton.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.771
There she was --

27:53.839 --> 27:56.103
the hair, the shoes,
and the whole thing.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.870
She said, "Dan, let me" --

27:57.943 --> 28:00.207
First of all,
she called me "Dan."

28:00.279 --> 28:02.145
Were you wearing a name tag?

28:03.215 --> 28:04.080
Yeah.

28:04.149 --> 28:05.913
All right, anyway,

28:05.984 --> 28:08.919
she said, "Dan, I'm not
much of a sports fan,

28:08.987 --> 28:11.820
"but when I've watched
your show..."

28:11.890 --> 28:14.655
[Laughs]
"you've made me laugh."

28:14.726 --> 28:16.717
You've made quite a few
of us laugh.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.854
Okay, you know what? She said
something nice about you,

28:18.931 --> 28:20.456
but I'm not gonna
tell you what it was.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.125
Carriage ride through
the park -- in or out?

28:22.201 --> 28:23.635
I'm not gonna
tell you that, either.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.397
Finish the story.

28:25.471 --> 28:29.430
The story is we had a
conversation -- seriously.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.272
Someone
had clearly briefed her

28:31.343 --> 28:32.936
on my stuff
with the public schools,

28:33.011 --> 28:34.103
and I told her
about my opposition

28:34.179 --> 28:36.443
to secular programs that
are publicly financed.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.279
I really spoke up,
and she seemed to listen.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.012
-- You mean nonsecular.
-- What do you mean?

28:41.086 --> 28:43.020
You don't oppose
secular programs

28:43.088 --> 28:44.317
that are publicly financed,

28:44.389 --> 28:47.017
you oppose nonsecular programs
that are publicly financed.

28:47.092 --> 28:50.528
-- Yes.
-- Go on.

28:50.596 --> 28:51.791
Wait.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.764
-- I'm right.
-- Are you sure?

28:53.832 --> 28:56.802
"Nonsecular" means
"bound to religious guidelines."

28:56.869 --> 28:58.860
"Secular" means
"free of religion."

29:00.939 --> 29:04.204
Okay. I'm sure I got it
right at breakfast.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.108
Well, 50/50 chance.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.872
<i>[Sighs deeply]</i>

29:08.947 --> 29:12.178
-- Yeah.
-- So, go on.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.152
-- I'm gonna go -- I'm gonna
change my clothes. -- <i>Okay.</i>

29:16.321 --> 29:17.880
-- I didn't get it right.
-- <i>I know.</i>

29:17.956 --> 29:18.946
-- I blew it.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

29:19.024 --> 29:22.153
I mixed up. I inverted the definitions
of “secular“ and “nonsecular.“

29:22.227 --> 29:23.854
Looks like that
might be the case.

29:23.929 --> 29:27.490
-- Hillary Clinton thinks I'm an idiot!
-- Either that or a religious bigot.

29:27.566 --> 29:30.661
-- I went to an Ivy League school, Casey.
-- A proud day for Dartmouth, Dan.

29:30.736 --> 29:33.000
I made an idiot out of myself
in front of Hillary Clinton.

29:33.071 --> 29:35.563
Yeah, but at least you had to
spend 1,000 bucks to do it.

29:35.641 --> 29:38.667
[Sighs]

29:38.744 --> 29:41.975
Well, clearly, I have to
get in touch with her.

29:42.047 --> 29:42.946
Clearly.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.609
I need her to know
that I know the difference

29:45.684 --> 29:47.652
between secular
and nonsecular.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.552
You <i>don't</i> know the difference
between secular and nonsecular.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.819
Yeah, but I do now, and I should have then.
I have to call her.

29:53.892 --> 29:56.452
At this point, I'd say
it's a moral imperative.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.020
-- I'll call her hotel. --
They'll put you right through.

29:59.097 --> 30:01.532
I'm not saying it's not
going to take perseverance,

30:01.600 --> 30:04.160
but I'm going to make contact
with this woman.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.601
-- Good luck.
-- <i>Thank</i> you.

30:05.671 --> 30:06.934
-- Casey...
-- I can't talk right now.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.632
No problem. Casey --

30:08.707 --> 30:10.436
Hey, I'm glad you're here, because
we have some decisions to make.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.307
I've had an epiphany.

30:12.377 --> 30:13.606
-- Really?
-- Yeah!

30:13.679 --> 30:15.841
-- Walk with me.
-- Okay.

30:17.849 --> 30:18.907
I was up all night.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.884
I heard.
Good bachelorette party?

30:20.953 --> 30:25.049
It was great, but that's not
where I was all night.

30:25.123 --> 30:27.114
Where were you all night?

30:27.192 --> 30:30.526
-- <i>Having</i> an <i>epiphany.</i>
-- <i>Was there</i> a <i>stripper?</i>

30:30.596 --> 30:32.860
-- At the party? Yes, there was.
-- Yeah.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.262
Did he have
a better body than me?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.767
Of course he had
a better body than you, Casey.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.324
He was a professional
male stripper.

30:37.402 --> 30:38.631
You know,
let me tell you something.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.968
When we're asked, men know
how to answer that question.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.167
It's not like I'm not
qualified for the job, Dana.

30:43.241 --> 30:44.299
-- It's just...
-- I know. I understand.

30:44.376 --> 30:45.571
Do you want to hear
about the epiphany?

30:45.644 --> 30:47.271
-- No.
-- Casey...

30:47.346 --> 30:48.711
Yes, but first, let me just
clear this plan with you.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.714
I pick you up
Saturday at 8:00.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.876
Drinks at Moomba,
dinner at Cafe des Artistes,

30:52.951 --> 30:56.353
and then -- wait for it -- a carriage ride
through the park with a bottle of champagne.

30:56.421 --> 30:58.549
-- I can top that. -- [Snaps
fingers] I'm listening.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.888
Instead of doing all that as
our first date Saturday night,

31:00.959 --> 31:03.326
we postpone our first date
for six months

31:03.395 --> 31:05.386
while you see other women.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.398
-- I'm sorry?
" H was mY epiphany.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.994
What was your epiphany?

31:12.070 --> 31:14.004
That instead of you and I
going out on our first --

31:14.072 --> 31:15.471
Don't say it again.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.372
What's happened?

31:17.442 --> 31:18.967
-- Listen.
-- I am.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.706
The bride, my friend --
at this thing last night --

31:21.780 --> 31:24.374
someone leaned over to me and
said “It's I never gonna last.“

31:24.449 --> 31:26.679
What's never gonna last?

31:26.752 --> 31:28.277
The bride and the guy.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.843
Why not?

31:29.921 --> 31:33.357
Because he was basically the
only guy she dated as an adult,

31:33.425 --> 31:35.189
and either she was gonna
meet someone better

31:35.260 --> 31:39.254
or she'd always feel like she
could have met someone better.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.958
-- Dana...
-- Casey...

31:41.033 --> 31:43.127
You started dating Lisa
when you were 18.

31:43.201 --> 31:46.068
-- You married her when you were 23.
-- I remember all that.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.402
I think you know
how I feel about you, Casey.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.100
<i>I think</i> I do.

31:50.175 --> 31:52.940
-- I want us to have a clear
shot at this. -- Me too.

31:53.011 --> 31:56.072
-- The date you planned sounds great.
-- Yes, it does.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.640
-- We're definitely going to do it.
-- Okay.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.515
But first, you got
to date other women.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.110
Let's go back
to the beginning.

32:07.459 --> 32:10.554
<i>You are about five different
kinds of crazy, you know that?</i>

32:10.629 --> 32:12.563
I don't think this is
the time or place, do you?

32:12.631 --> 32:15.464
No, you're right. Let's discuss
this six months from now

32:15.534 --> 32:17.662
after I've had more
experience with psychos.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.261
I have to talk to Isaac now.

32:19.337 --> 32:21.863
-- What if I just flat-out refuse?
-- What do you mean?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.999
What if I just refuse
to go along with your plan?

32:24.076 --> 32:26.704
Then you do not get
the wonder that is me.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.239
I'm not sure I want
the wonder that is you.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.909
Well, that's entirely
up to you.

32:32.984 --> 32:34.281
-- Yes, it is. Okay.
-- That's right.

32:34.352 --> 32:37.083
-- Fine. -- I-l want
to kill you right now.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.680
Problem is that's not
the only thing

32:38.757 --> 32:40.418
you want to do with me
right now, is it?

32:40.492 --> 32:42.324
No, that's pretty much it.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.624
I have to talk to Isaac now.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.095
What's the problem here?

32:46.164 --> 32:49.031
He's mad 'cause I had
an epiphany and he didn't.

32:50.769 --> 32:54.069
This isn't happening.

32:56.374 --> 32:57.808
[Knock on door]

32:57.876 --> 32:59.742
-- Come in.
-- Hey.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.279
How was the hooker party?

33:01.346 --> 33:04.179
Biker party. It was fine.
How was therapy?

33:04.249 --> 33:07.685
-- I walked 1/10 of a mile
on the treadmill. -- Good.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.815
-- Who's the ratings guy?
-- <i>Now,</i> Dana, <i>don't</i> go --

33:12.891 --> 33:16.054
-- Who's the ratings guy?
-- His <i>name's</i> Sam Donovan.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.289
Is he good?

33:17.362 --> 33:20.195
-- No, I decided to hire a moron.
-- Isaac...

33:20.265 --> 33:21.426
I think he's the best
in the business.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.524
I think there's
no one else close.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.899
<i>Who do I answer to --
you or him?</i>

33:24.970 --> 33:26.199
<i>Well, that's not how</i> --

33:26.271 --> 33:28.296
Isaac, who do I answer to,
you or him?

33:28.373 --> 33:29.898
I want you to work
with him, Dana.

33:29.975 --> 33:33.240
I want you to make this work.
It'll just be a short while.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.678
-- You didn't have to do this.
-- We're in third place.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.216
-- We were ticking up on our own.
-- Not fast enough.

33:38.283 --> 33:40.183
Fast enough for you,
fast enough for us.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.686
Not fast enough for them.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.484
I got to tell you,

33:44.556 --> 33:47.491
the sight of you -- the sight of
Isaac Jaffee fearing for his job...

33:47.559 --> 33:49.152
I want you
to work with him, Dana.

33:49.227 --> 33:50.717
I want you to make this work.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.968
-- Is there a number?
-- <i>What?</i>

33:57.035 --> 33:59.231
ls there a set number
of women?

33:59.304 --> 34:00.237
I don't know.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.795
'Cause if there's
a set number of women,

34:01.873 --> 34:03.807
maybe you can just get them
out of the way, bing-bam-boom.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.470
-- <i>Bing-bam-boom?</i> -- <i>That was</i> me <i>getting
women out of the way really fast.</i>

34:07.546 --> 34:10.880
-- You don't think her epiphany
sounds insane? -- I sort of do, yeah.

34:10.949 --> 34:13.418
But she didn't run it by me, so this
is the kind of thing that happens.

34:13.485 --> 34:17.149
No, this is the kind of thing that
happens when she does run it by you,

34:17.222 --> 34:18.917
so I'm surprised to hear
you weren't involved.

34:18.989 --> 34:21.482
Turning on me isn't
going to solve anything.

34:24.663 --> 34:25.926
What did he say?

34:25.996 --> 34:29.159
His name's Sam Donovan.
He's supposed to be very good.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.329
-- VVell, did Isaac say why all of a sudden
he decided to -- -- What do you think?

34:32.404 --> 34:34.702
Natalie, let me have senior
staff at 10 minutes to air.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.831
-- Sure. By the way,
this plan -- -- Yeah.

34:36.875 --> 34:37.808
Never ran it by me.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.900
I'm going with my instincts
on this one.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.139
It shows.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.045
I got to get to work.

34:44.114 --> 34:46.344
-- Dana, I have dated women before.
-- You have not.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.820
What about that double date at Anthony
Anthony's with you and Gordon?

34:49.888 --> 34:52.152
It almost turned
very serious with that girl.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.248
-- What was her name? -- Ah, for
the life of me, I can't remember.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.023
That's 'cause you ended up sitting at the
bar with me watching “Sports Night.“

34:57.094 --> 34:59.564
-- What about Sally?
-- That wasn't dating.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.066
VVell, we slept together almost
every night for three months.

35:02.133 --> 35:03.658
-- Thanks for reminding me.
-- Dana...

35:03.735 --> 35:05.931
That wasn't dating. That was
two lonely and pathetic people

35:06.004 --> 35:08.701
slinking off after her
crappy, little 2:00 A.M. show,

35:08.773 --> 35:11.333
getting drunk,
and using each other for sex.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.413
-- That's not dating?
-- No.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.245
Okay, but still, can I just do that for
a little while and we'll call it --

35:18.316 --> 35:19.784
-- No, sir!
-- Listen...

35:19.851 --> 35:21.717
Casey, I have dated,
and I'm done.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.312
The next thing I have --
I want it to be serious.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.585
The last thing you had,
you were engaged.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.057
You got to trust me on this.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.560
No, I don't think I do
have to trust you on this.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.062
We have a magical
first kiss in my office --

35:31.129 --> 35:33.097
I do not deny it was magical.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.723
You better not deny
it was magical,

35:34.799 --> 35:36.893
because I took you
off your feet, woman.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.299
I rocked you back.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.099
I do not deny it.

35:40.171 --> 35:43.141
I plan our first date --
Moomba, Cafe des Artistes --

35:43.208 --> 35:45.142
Carriage rides are out,
by the way.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.178
They are not out.
They are back in.

35:47.245 --> 35:48.804
Yeah?
If you're from Akron.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.075
[sighs] Hey.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.243
I'm not saying I wouldn't
have had a good time.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.344
-- So, this woman comes along at
your biker party -- -- Deanna.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.321
This drunken,
bitter, lesbian woman.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.189
Now, why would you do that? Why would
you go to lesbian right there?

36:01.259 --> 36:04.320
-- Tell me you're not a homophobe. --
Are you saying in order to prove to you

36:04.396 --> 36:06.091
that I'm grown-up enough
to go outwith you,

36:06.164 --> 36:08.690
you're gonna make me go out and
find other women to sample first?

36:08.767 --> 36:11.031
-- I'm not even gonna ask for approval.
-- Thanks.

36:11.102 --> 36:12.399
-- Casey...
-- Dana...

36:12.470 --> 36:14.598
We'll have more time
to talk about this later.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.540
Just know that I want to give
us the best possible chance.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.475
So you're going to have me
date your friends?

36:19.544 --> 36:22.514
I gotta go.
You all right?

36:22.580 --> 36:24.548
Actually, I am frightened
of my own life,

36:24.616 --> 36:26.880
but I'll talk to you later.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.283
Good.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.126
[sniffs]

36:43.201 --> 36:45.363
[Chuckles]

36:48.606 --> 36:52.440
-- [ Sighs] I'm going to have
to live with this. -- Yes.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.535
She never returned my calls.

36:54.612 --> 36:56.273
That's pretty surprising.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.440
She never returned my calls,

36:57.515 --> 36:58.505
and I'm going to
have to live with this

36:58.583 --> 37:00.608
the rest of my natural life.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.947
It's out there now,

37:04.022 --> 37:07.458
and it's probably getting
blown all out of proportion.

37:09.594 --> 37:10.857
Listen.

37:10.929 --> 37:14.456
You can hear the whispers
from the treetops.

37:14.532 --> 37:16.967
You know a lie can make it
halfway around the world

37:17.035 --> 37:19.436
before the truth has a chance
to get its boots on?

37:19.504 --> 37:20.972
What are you,
Burl Ives all of a sudden?

37:21.039 --> 37:22.564
As a matter of fact,
that was Mark Twain.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.109
-- I know who it was.
-- And so do I.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.406
And I'm able to quote him
because I'm educated.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.345
<i>I know things.</i>

37:29.414 --> 37:32.076
-- You work your whole life,
and in an instant... -- Yes.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.517
I'm sure she's told
her friends by now.

37:34.619 --> 37:35.950
Let's go.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.719
-- It's just out there...
-- Danny...

37:38.790 --> 37:40.280
and it can't be gotten back.

37:40.358 --> 37:42.793
What do you think
I should do about this?

37:45.063 --> 37:46.758
I think you should do
what she tells you to do.

37:46.831 --> 37:48.094
She had a weird night
at a party.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.032
Things will look different
in the cold light of day.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.230
-- Do you think? -- Does the plan
include you're supposed to have sex?

37:53.304 --> 37:55.170
I don't know.
I assume it's an option.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.175
-- You've explained to her that the
plan is insane? -- I'm trying.

37:58.243 --> 38:00.143
-- You want me to take a whack at it?
-- No.

38:00.211 --> 38:04.148
-- What's going on? -- I wanted us to say
hello to Sam Donovan before the show started.

38:04.215 --> 38:05.580
I'm sorry?

38:05.650 --> 38:07.982
I said I wanted us
to say hello to Sam Donovan,

38:08.053 --> 38:10.420
the ratings consultant,
before the show started.

38:10.488 --> 38:11.751
I thought you said,

38:11.823 --> 38:14.417
“I was thinking about my dating
plan and realized I was mental.“

38:14.492 --> 38:15.653
No.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.219
-- <i>Where</i> is <i>he?</i>
-- <i>I don't know.</i>

38:18.296 --> 38:19.923
Can I just say that I've had
experience with this before

38:19.998 --> 38:21.693
and I think you're all a little
too worried about nothing?

38:21.766 --> 38:23.165
These guys tend
to be obnoxious,

38:23.234 --> 38:26.135
but I've found they're mostly
obsequious and starved for acceptance.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.169
"Boned" and "deboned"
mean the same thing.

38:32.243 --> 38:33.540
Would you give it a rest?

38:35.213 --> 38:37.614
Actually, Danny's right. These
guys just want to be liked.

38:37.682 --> 38:38.979
<i>We show him that he's
perfectly welcome here</i>

38:39.050 --> 38:40.609
<i>but make it clear
we do a good show,</i>

38:40.685 --> 38:43.416
it's our show, and we're reluctant
to have the network involved

38:43.488 --> 38:45.047
in creative
or editorial decisions.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.784
We can't do that.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.987
-- Why? -- 'Cause Isaac
wants me to work with him.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.859
-- Dana... -- I'm gonna
work with him, Casey.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.194
It's just for a few weeks.

38:54.265 --> 38:56.632
[Sighs]

39:01.539 --> 39:03.803
There's such a word
as "disheveled,"

39:03.875 --> 39:07.709
but “sheveled“ is nowhere to
be found in the dictionary.

39:07.779 --> 39:08.712
Danny...

39:08.780 --> 39:11.545
I'm just saying
English sucks.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.182
We're starting
to press the clock.

39:18.256 --> 39:20.122
Dave, do me a favor.
Get us at ready-1.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.024
<i>Kim, Elliott, go ahead
and do your pref light.</i>

39:28.133 --> 39:32.331
-- Exactly how many dates do
I have to go on -- -- Later.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.274
This is nice.

39:37.342 --> 39:39.834
This is like quiet time.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.411
The hell with it.

39:43.481 --> 39:45.813
Let's go and do the show,
and then --

39:45.884 --> 39:47.750
Excuse me.

39:47.819 --> 39:49.184
Are you Sam Donovan?

39:49.254 --> 39:50.653
Yeah. I was just looking
for my office.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.247
I'm Dana Whitaker.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.791
How you doin'?

39:53.858 --> 39:55.189
-- Dan Rydell.
-- Casey McCall.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.625
Good to meet you.

39:56.694 --> 39:58.219
If someone could just
point me toward my office...

39:58.296 --> 40:00.765
We got together like this
to welcome you.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.994
Thanks. My office?

40:03.067 --> 40:05.195
I'm sorry.
You don't have one yet.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.204
I'm sure Janie, our
office manager -- [Thud]

40:07.272 --> 40:10.970
-- That'll be taken care of
by the morning? -- Yeah.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.010
Who's the segment producer
tonight?

40:13.077 --> 40:14.772
-- I <i>am.</i>
-- <i>What's your top story</i> --

40:14.846 --> 40:16.610
-- Oakland or Ted Marchibroda?
-- Ted Marchibroda.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.149
Make it Oakland, will you?

40:18.216 --> 40:20.150
Move Marohibroda to the 10-block.
Fill with the wild card.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.243
-- Are you scripted in the ones?
-- Yeah, but --

40:22.320 --> 40:24.311
<i>Excuse me, Jeremy.
Sam, what are you doing?</i>

40:24.389 --> 40:27.484
-- Hmm? -- I said,
“What are you doing?“

40:27.559 --> 40:31.325
It's gonna be helpful if you get
used to not asking that question.

40:31.396 --> 40:32.591
Hang on.

40:32.697 --> 40:36.258
You can't just come in here
and start dictating policy.

40:36.301 --> 40:38.565
<i>Now, we're ready to work with
you as long as you understand</i>

40:38.636 --> 40:40.661
that this is our show
and we feel we do it well.

40:40.738 --> 40:43.537
You should also bear in mind that
Dana doesn't stand alone here.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.372
Unless you want your first
action as a consultant

40:45.443 --> 40:47.343
to cause a full-staff walkout,

40:47.412 --> 40:50.143
including the on-air talent and
producers, I'd downshift a little.

40:52.984 --> 40:57.319
You shouldn't think that just because I'm
looking at you while you're talking to me

40:57.388 --> 41:00.414
that I'm necessarily listening to
or caring about what you're saying.

41:00.491 --> 41:02.482
It's just something I do
to be polite.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.858
I was lying
on a beach in Bali.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.694
I got a phone call.
I got on a plane for 14 hours.

41:07.765 --> 41:10.826
I was hired to raise this show's
audience share 3 points.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.803
Just between you and me,
I'm gonna raise it 3 1/2.

41:13.871 --> 41:16.806
I'm not lacking in confidence
as far as that's concerned,

41:16.874 --> 41:18.933
and because of that,
I can say this --

41:19.010 --> 41:21.980
I honestly don't give a damn
if any of you work here or not.

41:31.956 --> 41:33.822
Who's the coordinating
producer tonight?

41:33.891 --> 41:35.381
I am.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.428
Well, I've got 10:55.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.226
You want to call places?

41:43.234 --> 41:44.724
Places, first team.

41:44.802 --> 41:46.236
Dana...

41:46.304 --> 41:47.237
Go ahead, guys.

41:47.305 --> 41:48.238
No, wait a second.

41:48.306 --> 41:49.705
It's okay. Go ahead.

41:49.774 --> 41:52.766
-- <i>You sure?</i>
-- <i>Yeah. Good show.</i>

42:00.218 --> 42:01.686
I'm not gonna like you
very much, am I?

42:01.753 --> 42:05.189
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Dana.
Everybody likes me.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.691
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

42:07.759 --> 42:09.625
<i>Good evening.
From New York City,</i>

42:09.694 --> 42:11.753
<i>I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.</i>

42:11.829 --> 42:15.094
Those stories, plus “inside the
Playbook“ with Kelly Kirkpatrick,

42:15.166 --> 42:16.930
“Center Ice“
with Jack Jankowitz,

42:17.001 --> 42:19.595
and "The Infield Fly"
with Connie Morton in Chicago.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.833
All that coming up after this.

42:21.906 --> 42:25.342
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

42:25.410 --> 42:27.071
<i>Dave." We're out.</i>

42:39.390 --> 42:40.721
<i>On the next "Sports Night"...</i>

42:40.792 --> 42:42.658
I'm frightened
every time I'm near him.

42:42.727 --> 42:43.853
You gotta face that fear.

42:43.928 --> 42:44.918
<i>If I allow you three</i>

42:44.996 --> 42:46.930
to go in there
and mess with my show,

42:46.998 --> 42:50.263
will it keep my staff
from losing their jobs?

42:50.335 --> 42:51.496
I can't make promises.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.628
Fire me or shut the hell up.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.935
It doesn't seem like he's
recovering as fast as we hoped.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.668
You've become a malcontent,
Danny.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.471
You've become
a secretary, Dana.

42:59.544 --> 43:01.808
-- No <i>one's blaming you.</i>
-- <i>Every0ne's blaming me!</i>

43:01.879 --> 43:03.278
-- We're in trouble.
-- I know.
