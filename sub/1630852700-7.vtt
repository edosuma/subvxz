WEBVTT

00:20.083 --> 00:20.958
Shit.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.833
Talk to me, man. Come on, Chauncey.

00:27.833 --> 00:28.708
Oh, fuck.

00:30.083 --> 00:31.333
I don't feel good.

00:31.416 --> 00:33.541
Just keep talkin' to me, all right?
Do you hear me?

00:34.125 --> 00:35.000
Where's Jenny?

00:35.083 --> 00:37.666
She's taking care
of that Jackal dude, kickin' his ass, man.

00:37.750 --> 00:40.541
You need to turn around right now. Fuck!

00:41.500 --> 00:43.125
Don't worry. She can handle it.

00:43.208 --> 00:44.208
She needs our help.

00:44.291 --> 00:47.791
What needs to happen is you need
to get immediate medical attention.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.958
You cannot take me to a hospital, Chris.

00:50.041 --> 00:52.458
I'm not taking you
to a goddamn hospital, man.

00:52.541 --> 00:54.333
Then where the fuck are we going?

00:54.416 --> 00:57.291
Don't worry. I made some calls.

01:06.958 --> 01:09.083
All right,
some serious BF-fucking-T.

01:09.166 --> 01:11.125
He got sprayed in the eyes
with some chemical.

01:11.208 --> 01:12.541
So work your magic.

01:16.333 --> 01:17.583
Check on Jenny.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.750
Where the fuck is it?
Where the fuck is it?

01:37.333 --> 01:39.166
You must've put a camera in here.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.250
Fuck! The fuck did you put it?

01:50.375 --> 01:52.666
<i>I know, you were watching her, Svetlana!</i>

01:58.625 --> 01:59.791
Becca?

01:59.875 --> 02:01.416
<i>No, Jenny. It's Chris.</i>

02:02.625 --> 02:04.416
-Where are you?
-<i>I'm at the offsite.</i>

02:04.500 --> 02:06.541
<i>The place</i>
<i>where Chauncey first brought you.</i>

02:06.625 --> 02:07.916
<i>How's he doin'?</i>

02:08.000 --> 02:09.458
He got banged up pretty good.

02:09.541 --> 02:12.125
I had to call in a favor
to get a black ops medevac team

02:12.208 --> 02:13.291
to come work on him.

02:14.000 --> 02:14.833
You okay?

02:14.916 --> 02:16.666
<i>What happened with Carmo?</i>

02:16.750 --> 02:18.125
Carmo is dead, um…

02:18.875 --> 02:22.875
But, uh… They, uh…
They took Becca, so…

02:24.083 --> 02:26.625
I don't have
a lot of time to talk right now, um…

02:26.708 --> 02:28.000
I-I gotta go find her.

02:28.083 --> 02:30.625
<i>Let me help.</i>
<i>Stay at the hotel. I'll come to you.</i>

02:30.708 --> 02:33.041
Chris, there is no time.
She could be anywhere by now.

02:34.916 --> 02:35.791
<i>Hello?</i>

02:39.791 --> 02:41.458
How do you know I'm at the hotel?

02:42.250 --> 02:43.583
<i>I know you're at the hotel</i>

02:43.666 --> 02:46.333
<i>because I'm still getting</i>
<i>a signal from the com-link.</i>

02:46.916 --> 02:47.833
No, you're not.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.333
I lost my com-link
in the fight with Carmo.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.000
J… Jenny.

03:08.375 --> 03:09.375
Fuck!

03:39.416 --> 03:42.416
Chauncey, you motherfucker.

03:44.875 --> 03:46.208
Cameras in my eyes?

03:56.083 --> 03:58.500
So much here he didn't share.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.666
They see everything.

04:05.458 --> 04:06.791
Jesus Christ.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.708
I'm getting these things
out of my fucking eyes.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.250
Papa?

05:48.708 --> 05:51.041
Faina, please…

05:51.125 --> 05:52.625
What…

05:52.708 --> 05:53.750
Please, I'm…

05:53.833 --> 05:54.791
What have you done?

05:54.875 --> 05:55.791
I can explain. Please…

05:55.875 --> 05:58.166
-Why?
-I swear I didn't mean to--

05:58.250 --> 06:02.208
-Guards! Help me!
-Faina, quiet, please.

06:02.291 --> 06:04.458
Your father, he attacked me.

06:04.541 --> 06:05.541
Liar!

06:05.625 --> 06:08.666
I'm not lying, I swear.
Please listen to me.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.291
I had no choice. I love you.

06:11.375 --> 06:12.583
Let go of me.

06:12.666 --> 06:14.791
-Help me!
-Quiet, quiet.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.000
Please, please be quiet.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.041
Listen to me, please.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.583
I might just be able to save you.

06:20.666 --> 06:22.458
Please, you're in danger, Faina.

06:22.541 --> 06:24.000
Please listen to me.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.000
-May you burn in hell.

06:40.083 --> 06:43.833
Forgive me, please.
I had to do this.

06:43.916 --> 06:46.375
-Please forgive me.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.250
Jenny?

08:30.208 --> 08:31.958
When you start lifting cars?

08:32.875 --> 08:33.791
No, um…

08:35.166 --> 08:36.166
It's a rental.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.333
And I locked my damn key inside.

08:39.416 --> 08:43.958
You know, I don't wanna wait two hours
for them to bring a spare.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.291
I'm with you, girl.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.666
Well, uh, you do you.

08:52.791 --> 08:56.208
And, uh, let's just
keep this between us too?

08:57.250 --> 08:58.375
Keep what?

09:19.875 --> 09:20.875
Morning.

09:24.625 --> 09:25.541
What?

09:28.791 --> 09:29.916
What's that look?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.833
You look like the walking dead, man.

09:31.916 --> 09:33.416
Yeah, well, your mob doctor

09:33.500 --> 09:38.333
said it's a mild concussion
and a couple of bruised ribs.

09:38.416 --> 09:40.666
Okay. Ribs, who needs them though, right?

09:40.750 --> 09:43.500
Just pass me
those clothes over there, will you?

09:43.583 --> 09:44.750
No, seriously, Chaunce.

09:44.833 --> 09:48.375
You need to chill and give yourself
enough time to recover, man.

09:48.458 --> 09:50.125
Son of a bitch.

09:52.791 --> 09:53.916
Where's Jenny?

09:56.875 --> 09:58.916
Jenny is not our friend anymore.

09:59.416 --> 10:00.583
What does that mean?

10:00.666 --> 10:04.083
Remember how I warned you
about putting those cameras in her eyes?

10:04.791 --> 10:06.416
-She found them?
-And disabled them.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.875
And she will disable us
if she gets the chance.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.333
Jesus.

10:13.791 --> 10:14.791
It gets worse.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.541
Somebody kidnapped Becca.

10:18.625 --> 10:19.583
What? Who?

10:21.458 --> 10:22.375
Gideon?

10:22.458 --> 10:24.333
Gideon, the Caleros, Los Jinetes.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.666
Who the hell knows for sure, man?
But she is gone.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.000
And Jenny has gone
looking for her with a vengeance.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.333
Doesn't make sense. Why go after Becca?

10:34.625 --> 10:36.500
Unless they think keeping her hostage

10:36.583 --> 10:40.125
is gonna somehow stop us
from trying to stop the assassination.

10:40.208 --> 10:41.375
Assassination?

10:41.458 --> 10:44.000
There isn't gonna be
any assassination, man.

10:44.083 --> 10:45.958
Look, while you were sleeping,

10:46.041 --> 10:48.875
I tried to locate that bomb
with that tracker I put on it.

10:48.958 --> 10:51.208
-But I couldn't because--
-It's been deactivated.

10:51.291 --> 10:54.750
Bingo. The Caleros and Gideon,
they know they got played.

10:54.833 --> 10:57.708
All they can do is stand there
with their dicks in their hands.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.541
They won't. I'm telling you,

11:01.625 --> 11:06.375
bomb or no bomb,
Felipe Calero is a pure fucking zealot.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.708
Man, you really
don't know when to quit, do you?

11:11.583 --> 11:12.541
When I'm dead.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.458
When you're dead.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.708
Felipe, please listen to me.

11:20.791 --> 11:22.583
We need to walk away from this.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.541
Everything's been compromised

11:25.625 --> 11:27.791
<i>and even if Gideon</i>
<i>cannot understand that--</i>

11:27.875 --> 11:30.666
This has never been
about what Gideon wants.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.916
This is about fighting.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.875
Fighting for our future.

11:36.958 --> 11:40.708
<i>And you want us to run away like cowards?</i>

11:40.791 --> 11:43.166
No. Not like cowards.

11:44.125 --> 11:47.166
All I'm saying is,
we choose to fight another day.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.083
That's all.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.750
On a day

11:50.375 --> 11:54.000
when we have all the weapons
we need to accomplish our goals.

11:54.083 --> 11:58.000
We have everything
we need, Andrés. Everything.

11:58.083 --> 12:01.083
<i>Felipe, what are you talking about?</i>
<i>The bomb is useless,</i>

12:01.166 --> 12:03.833
the prime minister's itinerary,
meaningless.

12:03.916 --> 12:06.541
And even if he were
to choose his appointments,

12:06.625 --> 12:08.875
his security detail
is going to be impenetrable.

12:08.958 --> 12:10.166
<i>Settle down, brother.</i>

12:10.958 --> 12:11.958
<i>Listen to me,</i>

12:12.041 --> 12:16.250
<i>no amount of security</i>
<i>is ever impenetrable.</i>

12:16.333 --> 12:18.750
<i>Not if you're willing to make a sacrifice.</i>

12:19.500 --> 12:23.583
Not if you are willing to trade
one man's life for another man's.

12:25.583 --> 12:31.333
And that is precisely
what we must be prepared to do right now,

12:31.416 --> 12:33.625
and you mark my words, brother.

12:35.083 --> 12:39.625
Tonight, the prime minister will be dead.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.208
<i>And the Caleros and Los Jinetes</i>

12:43.291 --> 12:48.333
<i>will go down in history</i>
<i>as the saviors of a grateful nation.</i>

12:49.375 --> 12:50.291
Yeah.

12:51.166 --> 12:55.458
Or if we fail,
we will die forgotten in our prison cells.

12:59.125 --> 13:00.125
So be it.

13:08.208 --> 13:11.166
<i>How long before</i>
<i>you are through cleaning up at the house?</i>

13:11.250 --> 13:12.208
I'm done.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.166
I'll see you shortly.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.208
Sara?

14:14.750 --> 14:16.583
You're fucking joking.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.541
I knew my brother was a fool
for trusting some whore in the street.

14:24.625 --> 14:27.583
And you were even a bigger fool
for trusting your brother.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.958
-Fuck your mother.
-Hmm.

14:33.458 --> 14:37.708
Son of a bitch.

14:58.791 --> 15:01.083
Andrés, are you back with me?

15:04.083 --> 15:05.875
Cunt, where are you going?

15:07.208 --> 15:10.500
-Where's my daughter?
-Daughter? You have a daughter?

15:12.750 --> 15:14.166
Where did Gideon take her?

15:14.250 --> 15:16.166
I don't know, go fuck yourself!

15:20.083 --> 15:22.666
If you wanna live,
talk to me.

15:26.416 --> 15:27.666
Fuck you, cunt.

15:29.833 --> 15:32.041
I'm not telling you
a goddamn thing.

15:32.708 --> 15:33.541
Hmm.

15:37.875 --> 15:39.791
Well, I gotta give it to you, Andrés.

15:40.416 --> 15:44.416
Your brother would be a lot less stubborn
if he was in this fucking situation.

15:47.666 --> 15:49.291
-You're afraid?

15:51.250 --> 15:52.208
No.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.041
You're about to be.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.708
Oh, what?

16:28.541 --> 16:30.041
Oh, no.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.000
Damn, Jenny.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.166
Why did you have to do us like this?

16:35.958 --> 16:38.583
How long will it take you
to get us back up and running?

16:39.166 --> 16:42.041
Look, the good news is
everything is backed up.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.541
It's still gonna a couple hours

16:43.625 --> 16:46.458
to re-establish secure,
encrypted access to our data centers.

16:46.541 --> 16:47.958
And time is not on our side.

16:48.708 --> 16:49.708
Neither am I.

16:51.291 --> 16:52.333
Oh, shit.

16:54.791 --> 16:57.416
-Ohana, I was just about to--
-Shut up, Chauncey.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.583
You didn't think I was going to notice
that mess you left behind?

17:00.666 --> 17:02.333
I'm done with your excuses.

17:02.416 --> 17:04.458
And with whatever
you think you're doing here.

17:04.541 --> 17:07.583
You don't understand.
The prime minister's life is in danger.

17:07.666 --> 17:10.708
If that's true,
and I mean especially if that's true,

17:10.791 --> 17:14.416
I know we will all be a lot safer
with you two off the streets.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.458
Hold on. "You two"?

17:15.541 --> 17:17.708
I've been playing
under protest around here.

17:17.791 --> 17:19.250
You feel me? Oh, shit.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.958
You're both under arrest.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.125
Dear God,

17:29.958 --> 17:31.333
please help me.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.666
I feel like a vulgar thief.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.875
Running and hiding because of my brothers.

17:40.541 --> 17:42.250
And I have to confess, Lord,

17:43.166 --> 17:44.750
that I'm too afraid.

17:46.750 --> 17:48.750
So I beg you, please.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.541
Help me, please.

17:53.125 --> 17:54.333
Sara?

17:55.083 --> 17:57.500
-You look so--
-I have a confession to make.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.250
I lied to you.
I'm not the woman I said I was.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.083
I'm sorry?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.583
I'm not Sara Fonte.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.791
My name is Jenny Franklin

18:08.541 --> 18:10.416
and I don't have two sons.
I have one daughter.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.333
Please.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.375
Please, leave me alone.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.916
Her name is Becca, and she's 17 years old.

18:16.708 --> 18:18.750
Just a year younger than your son Diego.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.666
What do you want from me?

18:21.750 --> 18:25.541
You're the only person right now
who can help me save my daughter's life.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.958
I don't know anything about your daughter.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.416
-Felipe knows who took her.
-How dare you?

18:31.500 --> 18:34.958
How dare you come into a house of God

18:35.041 --> 18:37.375
and accuse my brother
of kidnapping your child?

18:39.625 --> 18:40.625
Inés.

18:42.416 --> 18:45.791
You know what your brother
and his Los Jinetes are capable of.

18:45.875 --> 18:51.166
Deep down, you know why your son, Ramón,
is never coming home to you ever again.

18:54.458 --> 18:58.083
No. No. It is not true.

18:59.041 --> 19:00.875
-It is not true, no.
-Yes. Yes.

19:02.416 --> 19:03.458
I was there.

19:05.791 --> 19:07.208
I was standing right there

19:08.500 --> 19:09.958
when Felipe shot Ramón.

19:10.833 --> 19:11.833
<i>Uncle, no.</i>

19:12.916 --> 19:14.500
He murdered your son.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.333
Because nothing is more important
to your brother than his cause.

19:18.416 --> 19:20.166
Not even family.

19:23.041 --> 19:24.041
I cannot help you.

19:24.666 --> 19:25.916
Tell me where he is.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.041
Please. Please let me go.

19:31.916 --> 19:33.166
Okay? Please.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.166
If you don't tell me where he is,

19:46.291 --> 19:48.916
Diego is gonna suffer
the same fate as his brother.

19:50.833 --> 19:53.625
His life is in danger.
Just like my daughter Becca's.

19:54.625 --> 19:56.500
Don't let our children
suffer for our sins.

19:56.583 --> 19:58.458
Please, tell me where he is.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.041
Please…

20:11.833 --> 20:14.125
Comrade Orlova? Are you all right?

20:14.750 --> 20:16.500
Yes, we're all fine. Thank you.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.208
Have a good evening,
Comrade Orlova.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.208
30

20:40.708 --> 20:42.916
-Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.
-What is it?

20:43.750 --> 20:45.416
Anya has restored contact.

20:59.916 --> 21:02.541
Yes. I have acquired "Yaroslav."

21:02.625 --> 21:05.208
Requesting immediate extraction
from mission's target site.

21:05.791 --> 21:06.875
<i>Negative.</i>

21:07.958 --> 21:12.375
Repeat. I have acquired "Yaroslav"
and require immediate extraction.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.833
Negative. Initiate Omega Protocol.

21:16.916 --> 21:18.958
<i>Negative. Extraction still viable.</i>

21:20.083 --> 21:23.625
Initiate Omega Protocol.

21:23.708 --> 21:24.708
I can't.

21:24.791 --> 21:26.916
<i>You will. It is your part to play.</i>

21:27.000 --> 21:29.583
<i>It is your sacrifice</i>
<i>that will bring glory to Mother Russia.</i>

21:29.666 --> 21:31.458
There must be some other way.

21:31.541 --> 21:35.000
<i>Initiate Omega Protocol now.</i>

21:41.750 --> 21:43.416
My beloved nephew.

21:53.166 --> 21:54.625
My beloved nephew.

21:55.625 --> 21:58.291
It is I
who owes you an apology.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.916
For killing my brother?

22:03.625 --> 22:05.041
For misjudging you.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.416
Sometimes

22:12.916 --> 22:16.166
the strongest among men
are mistaken for cowards.

22:16.250 --> 22:20.458
Because the courage of their convictions
makes them seem docile.

22:21.958 --> 22:25.583
When, in truth, they are immovable.

22:26.458 --> 22:27.583
I'm not a coward.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.208
You are most certainly not.

22:30.291 --> 22:34.583
And I can see that now because
the beam has been removed from my eye.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.375
Are you going to kill me?

22:44.291 --> 22:45.791
You mourned your brother.

22:47.458 --> 22:49.208
And that is as it should be.

22:51.041 --> 22:53.000
But what you do not understand

22:54.541 --> 22:58.208
is that your destiny
has always lay upon a higher path.

22:59.541 --> 23:00.541
My destiny?

23:02.583 --> 23:05.500
Soon, there will be a reckoning.

23:06.833 --> 23:11.583
And everything that we hold true
about our faith and our people

23:12.625 --> 23:14.000
will be called to task.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.375
And, in our darkest hour,

23:18.416 --> 23:19.666
God almighty

23:21.291 --> 23:25.291
has shone a light on you, Diego.

23:26.625 --> 23:29.333
I don't understand.

23:30.083 --> 23:31.750
You are my last hope, Diego.

23:33.708 --> 23:34.666
Our savior.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.208
The savior of Spain.

23:38.625 --> 23:39.833
I'm no savior.

23:44.083 --> 23:44.916
Listen.

23:46.041 --> 23:51.750
Your father, before his life
was stolen by those animals,

23:53.458 --> 23:56.000
told me about a vision
God had revealed to him.

23:57.333 --> 24:00.416
Of you striking down our fiercest enemy.

24:01.750 --> 24:03.541
-God?
-Yes.

24:15.625 --> 24:17.500
I miss my papa so much.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.541
I know. I know.

24:21.458 --> 24:25.416
And that's why
it's time to avenge him.

24:29.958 --> 24:31.208
For his family.

24:32.875 --> 24:33.875
For Spain.

24:46.666 --> 24:52.000
Honestly, I was never sure
if you were crazy or just full of shit.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.125
We don't have time for this.

24:54.208 --> 24:58.500
But what I do know for sure is,
ever since you got here to Madrid,

24:58.583 --> 25:00.375
the bodies have kept pilin' up.

25:02.958 --> 25:04.750
Lidia Orsorio.

25:05.583 --> 25:08.833
Miguel Dominguez. Ramón Santos.

25:09.416 --> 25:12.083
Zoya Kotova. Damían Abasolo.

25:12.166 --> 25:13.666
Tomás Alonso. Carmo Valter.

25:13.750 --> 25:16.833
I did everything I could
to prevent innocent people from dying.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.875
And if you don't
start to take me seriously,

25:18.958 --> 25:21.500
you'll have the prime minister's
death on your hands as well.

25:23.916 --> 25:24.875
Is that a threat?

25:25.708 --> 25:28.541
Seriously, what we're doing here,
it's all about reciprocity.

25:28.625 --> 25:31.583
The quid pro quo. So if you can
do a little something for me,

25:31.666 --> 25:34.333
I'll admit to pretty much
anything you want me to.

25:34.416 --> 25:37.833
Mr. Clarke, this is not how I work.

25:38.875 --> 25:41.083
I want the truth. The whole truth.

25:41.166 --> 25:44.041
Okay, I can do that. I can't do jail.

25:45.875 --> 25:49.916
Let's start with something
that requires no self-incrimination.

25:50.708 --> 25:52.125
This woman from the bathhouse.

25:53.250 --> 25:54.166
Yeah.

25:54.958 --> 25:57.125
She's like this old Russian agent.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.625
Code named "The Whisper."

25:59.291 --> 26:00.125
Actually,

26:02.500 --> 26:04.250
she's a pretty cool person.

26:04.333 --> 26:08.708
When she's not being basically blackmailed
into a life of international espionage.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.541
How about a real name?

26:11.625 --> 26:14.625
This is Marseille all over again.

26:14.708 --> 26:15.833
Is that right?

26:16.791 --> 26:18.291
Same international financier.

26:18.375 --> 26:20.500
-Code named "Gideon."
-Yes.

26:20.583 --> 26:23.208
And he's manipulating
a right wing nationalist group

26:23.291 --> 26:25.250
into perpetrating an act of terrorism.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.541
-Sound familiar?
-Another bombing?

26:27.625 --> 26:30.500
That's right. The plan has been
to kill the prime minister

26:30.583 --> 26:32.500
by any means necessary.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.041
Who are they?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.750
They call themselves "Los Jinetes."

26:37.333 --> 26:40.291
A small group made up
primarily of college-aged men.

26:41.375 --> 26:43.041
And they're being organized

26:43.125 --> 26:46.125
by Felipe Calero
and members of his family.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.500
Felipe Calero, the philanthropist,

26:48.583 --> 26:52.541
and his brother, Andrés,
one of Spain's top diplomats.

26:54.333 --> 26:56.375
You're trying to tell me these men

26:56.458 --> 26:59.541
are leading
a secret nationalist terrorist group?

26:59.625 --> 27:01.041
This is not a joke, Ohana.

27:01.125 --> 27:02.833
And I'm not laughing, Chauncey.

27:02.916 --> 27:05.458
Now, I need to start hearing something

27:05.541 --> 27:08.250
that sounds as if
it's coming from the real world.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.791
Look, I don't know who Gideon is.

27:12.833 --> 27:14.500
But I think my asset might.

27:15.666 --> 27:17.833
You mean Jenny Franklin?

27:19.625 --> 27:21.125
How do you know that name?

27:21.208 --> 27:23.333
So Jenny went in there deep undercover,

27:23.416 --> 27:26.041
disguised as this Spanish widow
named Sara Fonte,

27:26.125 --> 27:30.916
and then she was able to shape-shift
into this bomb maker named Damían Abasolo,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.333
and that's when we gave Gideon
and those Los Jinetes boys a bomb.

27:34.416 --> 27:35.958
You gave them a bomb?

27:36.041 --> 27:38.958
No. We gave 'em what looked like a bomb.

27:39.041 --> 27:40.375
It looked good too.

27:40.458 --> 27:43.666
Anyway, the mission
went sideways right after that, um…

27:43.750 --> 27:47.166
I mean, those boys,
they figured out they got rooked.

27:47.250 --> 27:48.583
So they went underground.

27:50.041 --> 27:51.041
Somewhere.

27:52.666 --> 27:54.125
To be honest, Mr. Clarke,

27:56.166 --> 27:59.958
I am appalled by the sheer arrogance
and sense of entitlement

28:00.041 --> 28:04.375
that made you think you could actually
deal with any of this on your own.

28:04.458 --> 28:07.083
That's a very fair
assessment of the situation, okay?

28:07.166 --> 28:10.083
So let me reiterate, once again,

28:10.166 --> 28:13.666
that I am
more than willing to sign an affidavit

28:13.750 --> 28:17.583
testifying to the fact
that the arrogant and entitled person here

28:17.666 --> 28:19.625
is definitely not me.

28:23.250 --> 28:26.625
Honestly, Miró,
I'm not sure what to believe.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.791
Want me to reach out
to the Cuerpo Nacional de Policía,

28:29.875 --> 28:31.000
just to be safe?

28:31.083 --> 28:33.083
Suggest they double
their security measures

28:33.166 --> 28:34.750
around the prime minister tonight.

28:35.333 --> 28:39.750
And let's send
some people over to the Hyatt Centric.

28:39.833 --> 28:43.541
Track down this elusive,
secret Russian operative, Jenny Franklin.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.958
She's registered as a guest there.

28:46.041 --> 28:47.666
-I'll go there myself.
-No.

28:47.750 --> 28:50.625
I want you to head out
to the Calero estate and check it out.

28:50.708 --> 28:52.458
But tread very carefully with them.

28:54.958 --> 28:56.666
You really believe they'd be involved

28:56.750 --> 28:58.875
in a plot to assassinate
the prime minister?

28:58.958 --> 29:00.083
Like I said,

29:00.666 --> 29:04.041
I don't know
what to believe about anybody anymore.

29:16.458 --> 29:17.541
Good evening.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.291
Welcome, Mr. Prime Minister.

29:25.375 --> 29:26.875
It's an honor to have you

29:27.458 --> 29:30.083
and your lovely wife join us this evening.

29:30.166 --> 29:31.583
If you'll follow me, please.

29:33.916 --> 29:35.125
Hello, good evening.

29:35.791 --> 29:36.750
Hello.

29:42.750 --> 29:43.625
Long live Spain.

29:43.708 --> 29:46.000
Long live Spain. God is with you.

30:44.541 --> 30:45.541
Andrés?

30:47.916 --> 30:49.375
Do I have your attention?

30:52.125 --> 30:53.125
Sara?

31:03.583 --> 31:06.333
They say that men
are the most violent of the two sexes…

31:06.416 --> 31:07.291
Sara.

31:07.375 --> 31:10.625
…but the truth is
the most dangerous animal in the jungle

31:10.708 --> 31:12.958
is the mother protecting her young.

31:25.916 --> 31:27.416
-Where's my daughter?

31:28.500 --> 31:29.541
I can't-- I can't--

31:34.541 --> 31:35.375
Where is she?

31:35.458 --> 31:38.041
I don't know anything
about your daughter--

31:45.208 --> 31:47.958
-You know where Svetlana is?
-I don't know, who is Sve--

31:48.041 --> 31:51.416
-Gideon? Where's Gideon?
-I know Gideon, I don't know--

31:53.291 --> 31:56.500
Help! Thank you. Thank you.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.500
Tell me where the fuck she is,
Felipe, and I might let you live.

32:00.583 --> 32:02.708
All I know is she owns Palacio de Hielo.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.458
-Palacio de Hielo?
-Yes. Yes.

32:06.541 --> 32:08.083
-The ice rink?
-No.

32:08.166 --> 32:09.833
Don't let me go, please.

32:09.916 --> 32:11.375
I don't wanna die.

32:14.750 --> 32:15.583
No!

32:20.250 --> 32:21.875
Neither did Lidia Orsorio.

32:34.916 --> 32:36.208
You made a deal?

32:37.583 --> 32:38.416
I'm out.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.250
-This isn't over.
-Oh, it is for me.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.500
What about Jenny?

32:44.583 --> 32:46.500
Please. This ain't about Jenny.

32:47.291 --> 32:49.500
No, it's not. It's about saving lives.

32:49.583 --> 32:51.333
I think it's about you.

32:51.416 --> 32:53.375
You might say it's about payback for Rose,

32:53.458 --> 32:55.000
but I don't buy that shit anymore.

32:55.708 --> 33:00.041
You needed to prove that you were right,
that everybody else around here was wrong.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.833
And you don't give any fucks
about who might get hurt along the way.

33:05.458 --> 33:06.458
That's not true.

33:09.208 --> 33:10.500
You sure about that?

33:19.333 --> 33:20.166
I'm sorry.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.416
I really am.

33:27.541 --> 33:30.833
Chief Inspector,
we found a body at the Caleros' estate.

33:30.916 --> 33:32.041
It was decapitated.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.416
But not before being mauled.

33:35.500 --> 33:38.125
But that was after
getting both knees shot out.

33:38.208 --> 33:41.916
Which, to me, looks like
your textbook version of overkill.

33:42.708 --> 33:44.583
You think this is personal?

33:44.666 --> 33:45.666
Real personal.

33:45.750 --> 33:48.250
-Any idea who this guy is?
-No.

33:48.333 --> 33:49.500
What about the Caleros?

33:50.083 --> 33:51.541
They are nowhere to be found.

33:51.625 --> 33:52.583
All of them?

33:52.666 --> 33:54.250
Every single one. Vanished.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.708
I don't know what to say.

33:55.791 --> 33:57.250
Hang on. They found a body.

33:57.333 --> 33:58.458
At the Caleros'.

33:58.541 --> 33:59.791
I'm sitting right next to you.

33:59.875 --> 34:02.125
-I can hear 'em.
-They can't find any of them.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.291
Okay. Let's not take any chances.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.333
Have a tactical team meet me
at the Museo Lázaro Galdiano.

34:07.416 --> 34:09.375
And I'll coordinate with the CNP.

34:15.291 --> 34:17.000
Looks like my ride is here.

34:17.833 --> 34:19.875
-Your ride?
-Oh, yeah.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.125
I'm getting transferred
to a more secure location.

34:22.208 --> 34:24.916
I don't know why you're still here,
but that's why I am.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.666
-We need to get to the Lázaro.
-Well, that ain't happenin'.

34:28.458 --> 34:30.375
Chris, I know what happens next.

34:30.458 --> 34:33.125
The Caleros are gonna sacrifice Diego.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Mr. Clarke,

34:36.833 --> 34:38.500
due to your cooperation,

34:39.250 --> 34:41.500
you're no longer
officially in our custody,

34:42.125 --> 34:44.291
so these CPN officers here,
they're gonna take--

34:44.375 --> 34:45.250
What are you--

34:48.916 --> 34:51.125
-You ruined my fucking life.

34:54.666 --> 34:56.541
Man, I mean it, I'm out.

34:56.625 --> 34:58.333
You think you got a trick up your sleeve

34:58.416 --> 35:00.750
or some shit
you're gonna pull out your back pocket.

35:00.833 --> 35:03.208
But you check that.
And accept you're on your own.

35:15.333 --> 35:16.375
Hey, <i>cálmate.</i>

35:19.208 --> 35:20.333
What the fuck?

35:25.166 --> 35:26.000
Shit!

35:30.708 --> 35:32.291
"Pull out of your back pocket."

35:44.416 --> 35:46.333
Oh, Chris, you are good.

35:47.500 --> 35:48.750
You are good.

36:05.416 --> 36:06.375
Svetlana?

36:13.375 --> 36:14.416
I'm here.

36:18.208 --> 36:19.250
But…

36:21.791 --> 36:23.666
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

36:23.750 --> 36:25.250
You are not going to die.

36:25.333 --> 36:26.291
Liar.

36:29.166 --> 36:34.541
Comrade Orlov. We heard a noise.
Open the door.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.750
<i>You only have two choices, Ptichka.</i>

36:37.583 --> 36:39.291
<i>You choose to stand your ground.</i>

36:40.291 --> 36:42.583
<i>The guards enter. They kill you.</i>

36:43.458 --> 36:46.125
<i>And your life will have meant nothing.</i>

36:49.291 --> 36:52.291
<i>Or you choose to do as I have trained you.</i>

36:53.125 --> 36:56.666
<i>Become what you were meant to be.</i>

36:58.416 --> 37:00.166
<i>-And live forever.</i>

37:04.500 --> 37:06.458
<i>Do not die in vain.</i>

37:15.750 --> 37:18.208
Please, you know the rules.

37:18.291 --> 37:20.375
We must conduct an inspection.

38:43.833 --> 38:44.958
Becca.

38:48.708 --> 38:49.625
Becca?

39:35.750 --> 39:36.833
Diego, stop!

39:41.541 --> 39:42.750
You don't wanna do this.

39:45.333 --> 39:47.125
Drop your weapons! Both of you. Now!

39:53.541 --> 39:54.666
Where's my daughter?

39:55.166 --> 39:57.875
Somewhere.
But I don't remember where.

39:58.375 --> 39:59.875
If you don't tell me where she is…

39:59.958 --> 40:01.500
You think you can scare me?

40:03.166 --> 40:06.208
When you have nothing to lose,
you have nothing to fear.

40:06.291 --> 40:07.750
Svetlana is just using you.

40:09.125 --> 40:10.916
The same way she used me.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.291
And when she's done with you…

40:12.375 --> 40:14.166
Oh, I know all about you, Anya.

40:15.291 --> 40:19.000
I lived all my life in your shadow.

40:20.166 --> 40:21.833
But no more.

41:31.875 --> 41:34.291
Diego.
You gotta listen to me.

41:35.208 --> 41:39.166
I know you think trading
your life for his will change everything.

41:39.666 --> 41:41.083
That it will make it right.

41:42.791 --> 41:43.833
But it won't.

41:43.916 --> 41:45.708
You don't know anything.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.208
I know everything
there is to know about you.

41:50.833 --> 41:51.791
And your brother.

41:54.541 --> 41:55.375
Chauncey,

41:56.750 --> 41:59.625
you need to put your gun down
and let us handle this.

41:59.708 --> 42:03.583
Felipe killed your brother
because he thought he was talking to me.

42:04.541 --> 42:05.375
But he wasn't.

42:06.458 --> 42:07.291
I swear.

42:09.083 --> 42:10.541
Your brother wasn't a traitor.

42:10.625 --> 42:12.166
Stop talking about my brother.

42:12.750 --> 42:14.541
And he was killed because of a lie.

42:14.625 --> 42:15.500
Shut the fuck up.

42:15.583 --> 42:16.708
A lie told by Gideon.

42:16.791 --> 42:20.333
A lie meant
to divide and conquer your family.

42:20.416 --> 42:25.083
A lie Gideon knew would eventually be used
just like your father's murder

42:25.166 --> 42:28.791
to put you right here, right now,
willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.

42:29.666 --> 42:30.708
For Spain.

42:30.791 --> 42:32.500
No! No! Diego.

42:34.208 --> 42:35.333
It's not for Spain.

42:36.750 --> 42:38.166
This is only for Gideon.

42:46.583 --> 42:49.416
If you wanna honor
the memory of your brother,

42:50.791 --> 42:52.083
and your father,

42:53.583 --> 42:55.250
if you wanna keep your mom safe,

42:57.291 --> 42:58.541
then you can't do this.

43:00.208 --> 43:01.875
I am the savior.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.083
Diego.

43:05.375 --> 43:06.708
Don't let the lies win.

43:07.791 --> 43:09.541
-Don't let the lies win.

43:15.333 --> 43:16.833
Let me help you.

43:28.458 --> 43:30.000
-It's okay.

43:32.791 --> 43:33.708
It's okay.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.916
The birdie fell out of its nest.

44:30.125 --> 44:32.375
Sooner or later, my dear,

44:33.375 --> 44:34.750
this was inevitable.

44:47.833 --> 44:48.958
You did well.

44:49.750 --> 44:50.666
Well…

44:51.458 --> 44:52.458
Come here.

45:30.416 --> 45:32.000
My poor birdie.

45:34.541 --> 45:36.583
Did you think I wouldn't recognize you?
