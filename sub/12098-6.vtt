ANNOUNCER:
<i>In the last episode of</i> Soap,

00:04.571 --> 00:05.571
<i>Real Burt was beamed home,</i>

00:05.572 --> 00:07.072
<i>but Alien Burt</i>
<i>answered the door,</i>

00:07.073 --> 00:08.574
<i>much to both Burts'</i>
<i>astonishment,</i>

00:08.575 --> 00:10.075
<i>so real Burt ran away,</i>

00:10.076 --> 00:13.078
<i>figuring two Burts</i>
<i>would be too much for Mary.</i>

00:13.079 --> 00:16.081
<i>Danny brought Millie home,</i>
<i>much to Mary's surprise.</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:18.083
<i>Chester,</i>
<i>much the same as before,</i>

00:18.084 --> 00:20.085
<i>has planned a rendezvous</i>
<i>with another woman.</i>

00:20.086 --> 00:22.588
<i>And because Tim hasn't</i>
<i>been much in the bedroom,</i>

00:22.589 --> 00:24.590
<i>Corinne</i>
<i>hasn't been getting much.</i>

00:24.591 --> 00:26.091
<i>And Billy,</i>
<i>although much younger,</i>

00:26.092 --> 00:27.593
<i>is very much taken</i>
<i>with his teacher.</i>

00:27.594 --> 00:29.094
<i>Too much?</i>

00:29.095 --> 00:32.598
<i>It won't be</i>
<i>after this episode of...</i> Soap.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.104
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of two sisters,</i>

00:39.105 --> 00:41.607
<i>Jessica Tate...</i>

00:41.608 --> 00:43.609
<i>and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:43.610 --> 00:47.112
<i>These are the Tates...</i>

00:47.113 --> 00:51.116
<i>and these are the Campbells...</i>

00:51.117 --> 00:54.620
<i>and this is...</i> Soap.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.155
Mary?

01:30.156 --> 01:31.156
Oh, Mary, Mar...

01:31.157 --> 01:32.658
Thank God it's you, Mare.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.159
Listen, you got to come
right down here.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.661
I got to tell you something.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.663
It's unbelievable
what I'm going to tell you.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.665
You won't believe
what I'm I going to tell you,

01:39.666 --> 01:42.668
it's so unbelievable
what I'm going to tell you.

01:42.669 --> 01:45.671
I can't tell you.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.172
No, no, no, no, no.

01:47.173 --> 01:48.674
Mare, Mare,
you got to come here.

01:48.675 --> 01:49.675
I can't come home.

01:49.676 --> 01:50.676
Just come down here.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.178
I just got to talk to you,
please, now.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.180
No, no, I'm not in any trouble.

01:55.181 --> 01:56.181
Nothing like that.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.683
Yeah, I'm in a little trouble.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.184
I'm in a lot of trouble here,
Mary.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.686
Get down here right away.

02:00.687 --> 02:01.687
Why? Now, Mary, listen, come...

02:01.688 --> 02:04.189
Mary, come on, now.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.191
Get a hold of yourself
and calm down.

02:06.192 --> 02:07.693
All right, now.

02:07.694 --> 02:12.698
Listen, if you see me
between here and home,

02:12.699 --> 02:15.701
don't pay any attention to me.

02:15.702 --> 02:17.703
Mary, Mary, what's the m...

02:17.704 --> 02:18.704
Take it... Mary.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.205
Come on, now.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.206
Take... Take it easy, Mary.

02:21.207 --> 02:22.708
Just take it easy.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.210
All right.

02:25.211 --> 02:28.714
So, how you been?

02:28.715 --> 02:29.715
What?

02:29.716 --> 02:30.716
No. All right, Mary. Just...

02:30.717 --> 02:32.217
Down here.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.719
I'm at Mr. Kline's.
Kline's Drugstore.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.220
Just... All right, hurry.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.722
All right,
I'll be waiting for you.

03:01.748 --> 03:03.248
Come here, Danny.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.750
Hey, Millie.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.251
Danny, I don't know
how to say this.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.253
What? What is it?
What's the matter?

03:08.254 --> 03:11.256
Your father is a nymphomaniac.

03:11.257 --> 03:14.260
You mean he lights fires?

03:16.262 --> 03:17.763
No.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.264
A nymphomaniac.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.766
He's sex-crazy.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.768
Oh, come on, Millie.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.770
Danny, last night,
when I was taking a shower,

03:24.771 --> 03:26.773
he got in the shower with me.

03:28.034 --> 03:29.274
When I screamed, he apologized,

03:29.275 --> 03:31.777
and said he hadn't
seen me in there.

03:31.778 --> 03:32.778
Yeah, well, that could happen,

03:32.779 --> 03:35.781
because that bathroom
gets really fogged up.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.282
Well, I thought of that too,

03:37.283 --> 03:39.785
except later, I woke up
in the middle of the night

03:39.786 --> 03:42.287
and found him in my bed.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.289
What was he doing in your bed?

03:44.290 --> 03:47.793
Well, let's just say
it's good I woke up when I did.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.795
He said he was
walking in his sleep.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.296
No. No, Millie.

03:51.297 --> 03:52.798
Burt's not like that.

03:52.799 --> 03:56.301
I like you a lot, Danny,
I really do, but...

03:56.302 --> 03:57.302
I got to tell you,

03:57.303 --> 03:58.804
this is really a weird place.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.306
Danny, would you mind

04:01.307 --> 04:02.307
setting the table for dinner?

04:02.308 --> 04:04.810
I have to run out
for a while and meet Burt.

04:04.811 --> 04:05.811
Sure, Ma.

04:05.812 --> 04:06.812
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:06.813 --> 04:07.813
So then I said,

04:07.814 --> 04:09.314
"What do you think I am,
warped?"

04:13.820 --> 04:16.322
Burt, what are you doing here?

04:18.324 --> 04:20.325
I think I live here.

04:20.326 --> 04:23.328
Burt, you just phoned me
and said I should go right over

04:23.329 --> 04:25.831
to meet you
at Kline's Drugstore.

04:25.832 --> 04:26.832
Oh, pfft, come on...

04:26.833 --> 04:29.334
Mary, come on now, be serious.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.836
I mean, why would I
pick Kline's?

04:30.837 --> 04:33.338
I'd rather meet you in bed.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.841
See that? Bed.

04:35.842 --> 04:36.842
Then who called me?

04:36.843 --> 04:38.343
Oh, I don't know, uh...

04:38.344 --> 04:40.345
you know,
maybe it was Mr. Kline.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.847
He's no dope.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.849
But Burt, it was your voice.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.350
I was with him the entire time.

04:45.351 --> 04:46.852
He never made a call.

04:46.853 --> 04:47.853
That's good.

04:47.854 --> 04:49.856
The dummy verifies
the sex maniac's story.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.859
Burt, you also said

04:53.860 --> 04:55.861
that if I should
see you on the way,

04:55.862 --> 04:57.362
I should ignore you.

04:57.363 --> 04:58.363
Mary, have you been drinking?

04:58.364 --> 04:59.364
Burt!

04:59.365 --> 05:02.367
I think the lady's ready
for the cookie jar.

05:02.368 --> 05:03.368
I am not.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.370
I mean, uh, next thing
you'll be saying

05:05.371 --> 05:07.372
is that you've seen two of us.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.874
You didn't call me?

05:08.875 --> 05:11.376
Yeah, Ma, it was
probably a crank call.

05:11.377 --> 05:12.878
But it was Burt's voice.

05:12.879 --> 05:13.879
It was his voice.

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
I know his voice.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.381
Take it easy, Mary.
Take it easy.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.883
That's the voice.
That voice.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.885
I don't know anything
about nervous breakdowns,

05:19.886 --> 05:21.386
but I think your mother's
having one.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.387
I am not!

05:22.388 --> 05:23.889
Maybe I am.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.390
Mary, listen, now,

05:25.391 --> 05:26.892
I think it's fatigue here.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.393
You've been acting
a little strange lately,

05:28.394 --> 05:30.395
and I think what this is
is fatigue.

05:30.396 --> 05:31.897
He never lets her shut her eyes.

05:31.898 --> 05:33.398
BURT: So come on,
go upstairs,

05:33.399 --> 05:34.900
and, you know,
get a little rest.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.401
Come on. Just...

05:36.402 --> 05:38.403
Come on, Mare.

05:38.404 --> 05:39.905
You didn't call?

05:39.906 --> 05:40.906
You really didn't call?

05:40.907 --> 05:42.908
No, Mary, come on.
Let's go. Come on.

05:42.909 --> 05:43.909
You're going to lie down.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.410
I may even lie down with you.

05:45.411 --> 05:46.912
That's the voice.
That's the voice.

05:58.925 --> 05:59.925
Don't bother.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.086
I'm just going to mess it up.

06:02.428 --> 06:03.929
Something wrong?

06:03.930 --> 06:04.930
I think so.
What?

06:04.931 --> 06:06.431
Chester, I need
to know something.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.433
Are you having an affair?

06:08.434 --> 06:10.435
Jessica.

06:10.436 --> 06:11.436
Jessica.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.438
Oh, Jessica.

06:13.439 --> 06:15.941
Jessica, Jessica, Jessica.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.443
Am I having an affair?

06:19.946 --> 06:22.948
Chester, you didn't
answer the question.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.449
Well, I can't answer it,
Jessica,

06:24.450 --> 06:26.952
dignify that question
with an answer.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.954
Is that a yes or a no?

06:28.955 --> 06:30.455
That is a no.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.957
And I am surprised

06:31.958 --> 06:34.459
that you could even entertain
such a thought.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.461
Well, it's a whole bunch
of things.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.463
A whole bunch of little things
that separately don't mean much,

06:38.464 --> 06:40.465
but, added up,

06:40.466 --> 06:43.969
they begin to look
very familiar and suspicious.

06:43.970 --> 06:44.970
Like what?

06:44.971 --> 06:46.471
Name one thing.

06:46.472 --> 06:47.472
Well...

06:47.473 --> 06:48.974
for one thing,

06:48.975 --> 06:52.978
you've been acting very nice
and caring and cheerful lately.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.980
Oh, nice and caring
and cheerful? Yes.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.481
Would you like it

06:56.482 --> 06:57.482
if I came home and ignored you?

06:57.483 --> 06:59.484
If I spat on you and moved out,

06:59.485 --> 07:00.485
then you'd really feel secure?

07:00.486 --> 07:02.487
Oh, Chester,
that's not what I mean.

07:02.488 --> 07:03.989
That is what you said, Jess.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.490
You were suspicious

07:05.491 --> 07:07.993
because I am nice and caring
and cheerful.

07:07.994 --> 07:10.495
And you also
went back to the gym.

07:10.496 --> 07:11.997
The gym?
Yes.

07:11.998 --> 07:15.000
Do you think I'm carrying on
with one of the guys at the gym?

07:15.001 --> 07:17.002
It's just that, you know,

07:17.003 --> 07:20.005
when you were... fooling around,
you went to the gym.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.507
Jess, I've always
gone to the gym.

07:22.508 --> 07:25.010
I know.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.512
This is very good so far.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.514
A nice, caring, cheerful man

07:29.515 --> 07:31.016
who does push-ups

07:31.017 --> 07:33.518
is probably having an affair.

07:33.519 --> 07:36.021
And you didn't come home
last night.

07:36.022 --> 07:39.024
I told you why, Jess,
when I called.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.526
The meeting
with Ralph Hirschberg

07:41.527 --> 07:44.029
went on for so long
that I missed the last train.

07:44.030 --> 07:46.531
I stayed at a hotel.

07:46.532 --> 07:50.035
When you did come home,
you were reeking of perfume.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.038
Ralph's.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.041
Ralph's perfume?

07:56.042 --> 07:57.542
This will probably come

07:57.543 --> 07:59.544
as an enormous shock to you,
Jess.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.046
It did to me.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.048
Ralph Hirschberg is gay.

08:03.049 --> 08:07.052
Ralph Hirschberg?

08:07.053 --> 08:10.555
A queen, Jess.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.058
Oh, but he and Maureen
are so happy,

08:13.059 --> 08:16.061
and they have those
two lovely children.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.562
Uh-huh, well, that's what
I kept telling myself,

08:17.563 --> 08:20.566
but when he tried to kiss me
on the mouth...

08:23.569 --> 08:25.570
I had to believe that.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.073
Ralph Hirschberg?

08:28.074 --> 08:32.577
I heard he's practically engaged
to Maureen's hairdresser.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.078
Oh.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.581
Poor Maureen.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.582
I should call her.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.086
Don't tell her, Jess.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.087
Why not?

08:42.087 --> 08:43.087
Why not?

08:43.089 --> 08:44.589
Yes.

08:44.590 --> 08:45.590
Her heart.

08:45.591 --> 08:46.591
It's weak enough already.

08:46.592 --> 08:49.594
Maureen Hirschberg
has a weak heart?

08:49.595 --> 08:51.096
Of course.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.097
Is it any wonder,

08:52.098 --> 08:54.099
with her daughter dating
a member of the PLO?

08:54.100 --> 08:57.102
Son sitting
in the closet all day

08:57.103 --> 08:58.603
with his head in a bag of glue?

08:58.604 --> 08:59.604
Oh, no.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.106
Don't you see, Jess?

09:01.107 --> 09:02.607
Maureen has the problems,

09:02.608 --> 09:04.109
not you.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.110
Well, it's just that, you know,

09:05.111 --> 09:06.111
when it happened before,
Chester,

09:06.112 --> 09:07.612
it hurt me so much

09:07.613 --> 09:10.615
that now the littlest thing
makes me wonder.

09:10.616 --> 09:13.118
Jess, that's because
you have time on your hands.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.120
If we were farmers,
you wouldn't worry.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.124
Because if we were farmers,
you wouldn't have time.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.627
Oh, Jessica.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.130
I'm sorry.

09:25.131 --> 09:28.134
Okay,
I'll forgive you this time.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.637
Come to bed.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.142
In a moment, Chester.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.651
Thank you.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.153
Thank you.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.654
So what's the problem?

09:49.655 --> 09:50.655
Oh, I feel terrible, Corinne.

09:50.656 --> 09:53.658
Dutch has laid his whole life
on the line for me

09:53.659 --> 09:55.160
and now I'm having
second thoughts.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.161
What do you mean?

09:56.162 --> 09:58.163
I am sick of him.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.665
Good.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.167
Everything he does bothers me.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.668
I mean, I hate the way looks.

10:03.669 --> 10:04.669
I hate the way he walks.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.171
I hate the way he talks.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.672
I hate the way
he chews his food,

10:07.673 --> 10:08.673
when he bothers to chew it.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.175
I hate everything about him.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.176
Have you told him?

10:11.177 --> 10:12.177
Not yet.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.179
Well, I wouldn't get him
too angry, Eunice.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.181
The man killed once.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.183
I am disturbed, Corinne.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.684
I'm a disturbed person.

10:19.685 --> 10:22.187
I mean, when he was in jail,
when we were on the run,

10:22.188 --> 10:23.188
I adored him.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.190
Now I've got him and I don't.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.691
I fell in love with the event,
Corinne,

10:26.692 --> 10:28.193
not the man.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.696
I never see enough of Tim
to get sick of him.

10:31.697 --> 10:35.200
Dutch does things
that drive me up the walls.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.203
Like, do you know what he does?

10:38.704 --> 10:39.704
Never mind.

10:39.705 --> 10:40.705
Oh, what?

10:40.706 --> 10:42.207
I can't. It's too disgusting.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.708
Oh, come on, tell me.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.210
You'll throw up.
Eunice.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.711
I can't.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.213
Well, what does it
have to do with?

10:48.214 --> 10:49.714
It's about... About...

10:49.715 --> 10:51.216
Never mind.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.717
Oh, Eunice.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.220
I'm too embarrassed.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.721
Well, tell me quickly.
What's it about?

10:56.722 --> 10:59.224
Boogers!

11:06.732 --> 11:08.734
My God.

11:13.239 --> 11:14.740
Oh, quick. Hide.

11:16.661 --> 11:17.742
Why are we hiding, Corinne?

11:17.743 --> 11:19.244
Look.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.751
Put your menu down, Eunice.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.254
Who is that?

11:29.255 --> 11:30.755
It's your father.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.757
It is not.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.760
Take another look.

11:37.263 --> 11:40.265
So it looks a little like Daddy.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.266
Eunice.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.268
What are we going to do?

11:43.269 --> 11:45.270
I'm going to have
the artichoke vinaigrette

11:45.271 --> 11:47.772
and the cold salmon
with dill sauce.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.274
No, I mean about Daddy.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.276
Oh, Corinne,
how do we even know it's him?

11:51.277 --> 11:53.278
Not every gray-haired man
is Daddy.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.279
It's Daddy.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.780
No, it's not.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.282
The ears
are completely different.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.283
It is Daddy.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.284
That man is Daddy.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.286
I would know Daddy anywhere.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.287
And I wouldn't?

12:02.288 --> 12:03.288
It is not Daddy.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.289
Daddy.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.290
Not Daddy.
It is not Daddy.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.791
It is absolutely not Daddy,

12:06.792 --> 12:08.293
and I'll tell you why
it's not Daddy.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.294
Because if that was Daddy,

12:09.295 --> 12:11.297
the woman he's with
would be Mother.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.811
It's nice here.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.313
Very, very nice.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.814
It... I like it a lot.
Good.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.816
Why are we here?

12:31.817 --> 12:32.817
What do you mean?

12:32.818 --> 12:34.319
It's 35 miles
from the nearest town

12:34.320 --> 12:36.321
on an unpaved back road.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.822
It's not listed
in the phone book.

12:37.823 --> 12:39.324
There's not even
a name on the door,

12:39.325 --> 12:41.326
and yet it's packed.

12:41.327 --> 12:45.330
I know, and I'm
ashamed of myself.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.831
What do you mean?

12:46.832 --> 12:48.833
Well, It's for people
who are sneaking around,

12:48.834 --> 12:50.335
like we are,

12:50.336 --> 12:51.336
who don't want to be seen,

12:51.337 --> 12:53.338
and it's not right, Billy.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.340
I get the feeling
I'm being dumped.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.841
Listen, Billy.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.843
I'm not just an older woman,
I'm a teacher.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.346
I don't see any good
coming from this.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.847
Terrific.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.850
I'm being dumped an hour away
from the nearest phone.

13:05.851 --> 13:06.851
You should be out with...

13:06.852 --> 13:08.853
Teenage girls?
Cheerleaders?

13:08.854 --> 13:10.355
Roller-skating on Jones Beach?

13:10.356 --> 13:12.357
Pepsi and french fries
at Pop's after school?

13:12.358 --> 13:14.359
Look, I'd love
to be with someone

13:14.360 --> 13:15.860
nice and young and full of life,

13:15.861 --> 13:17.862
who likes the same things
that I do.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.364
Well, there.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.365
You see?

13:20.366 --> 13:22.867
And I am.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.869
You are?

13:24.870 --> 13:26.871
Yes.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.373
Oh.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.376
I could learn to skate.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.380
I hate skating.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.382
Me too.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.383
Good evening.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.884
Would you, uh, care for a drink?

13:39.885 --> 13:41.386
Ah, yes. Leslie?

13:41.387 --> 13:43.388
I'll have a vodka tonic.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.389
And I'll have...

13:44.390 --> 13:45.890
Uh, may I see your I.D.,
please?

13:45.891 --> 13:48.393
My I.D.?
You want my I.D.?

13:48.394 --> 13:49.894
You flatter me, sir.

13:49.895 --> 13:52.397
I haven't been asked
for an I.D. in years.

13:52.398 --> 13:55.900
Sometime tonight would be nice.

13:55.901 --> 13:56.901
Well, it just so happens

13:56.902 --> 13:58.904
that I left my I.D.
on my... plane.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.407
Do I have to
call over the manager?

14:02.408 --> 14:03.908
I mean,
must I really embarrass you

14:03.909 --> 14:05.910
by calling over the manager
and telling him

14:05.911 --> 14:08.913
that Billy Sinatra
is being checked for I.D.?

14:08.914 --> 14:10.915
What would you like to drink,
sir?

14:10.916 --> 14:12.417
I'll have a 7-Up.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.919
Very good.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.923
Oh, you were wonderful.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.925
Thanks.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.431
Want to dance?

14:26.432 --> 14:27.933
Sure.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.940
Clean this up.

14:40.446 --> 14:41.946
Oh, quick. Dip me.

14:41.947 --> 14:42.947
What?

14:42.948 --> 14:43.948
Dip me, dip me.

14:43.949 --> 14:44.950
In what?

14:48.954 --> 14:49.955
Sorry.

14:51.957 --> 14:52.957
Oh, that was close.

14:52.958 --> 14:53.958
What's wrong?

14:53.959 --> 14:56.961
Oh, that was Mr. Morris.
Biology 101.

14:56.962 --> 14:57.962
You think he'll say anything?

14:57.963 --> 14:59.464
No, I don't believe so.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.465
Why not?

15:00.466 --> 15:02.967
Because that wasn't Mrs. Morris.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.470
Do want to go
somewhere else? Do you?

15:05.471 --> 15:09.474
Nah. I don't care who sees us,
because if they see us,

15:09.475 --> 15:10.975
they have no business here
either.

15:10.976 --> 15:13.478
Amen.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.482
Don't look.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.483
What?

15:18.484 --> 15:19.484
I don't believe it.
What?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.486
My sister, with another man.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.988
Do you want to go
someplace else? Nah.

15:23.989 --> 15:24.989
Listen,

15:24.990 --> 15:25.990
two of my teachers are here.

15:25.991 --> 15:26.991
My sister's here.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.493
Who else could possibly show up?

15:41.507 --> 15:45.510
And Abraham begat Isaac,

15:45.511 --> 15:49.013
and Isaac begat Jacob,
and Jacob begat Judas,

15:49.014 --> 15:51.015
and Judas begat Elizar,
Elizar...

15:53.018 --> 15:54.519
You know,

15:54.520 --> 15:56.521
I used to know these
all by heart. Really?

15:56.522 --> 15:58.022
Begats are great
for falling asleep.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.023
It's like counting sheep.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.526
I know a better way

16:01.527 --> 16:04.028
with a little less talking.

16:04.029 --> 16:07.031
Begat Solomon,
and Solomon begat Boas,

16:07.032 --> 16:09.034
and Boas begat Obit.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.037
You going to be finished soon?

16:13.038 --> 16:15.540
Corrine, this isn't
the Harold Robbins novel.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.042
This is the Bible.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.044
One doesn't finish the Bible.

16:20.045 --> 16:23.548
Jesse begat David.

16:23.549 --> 16:28.052
David begat Solomon,
and Solomon begat Erin,

16:28.053 --> 16:29.554
and Erin begat Ellias,

16:29.555 --> 16:31.055
and Elazar begat...

16:31.056 --> 16:32.056
Tim.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.558
Corrine, please.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.059
Look, I don't mind
a little begatting,

16:35.060 --> 16:36.561
but how about

16:36.562 --> 16:38.062
begatting around with me
a little bit?

16:38.063 --> 16:39.063
I mean, come on already.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.565
Let's begin the begats.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.568
My religion
is very important to me.

16:43.569 --> 16:47.071
You're using your religion
as and excuse to avoid me,

16:47.072 --> 16:48.573
and I find that detestable.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.575
I can't help it
if I'm the way I am.

16:50.576 --> 16:51.576
I have certain needs.

16:51.577 --> 16:52.577
And I don't?

16:52.578 --> 16:54.078
Well, look at you.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.080
It looks like you're wearing
a spider's web.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.082
Oh.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.084
So I'm cheap, is that it?

17:00.085 --> 17:05.589
I'm an oversexed tart, right?

17:05.590 --> 17:07.090
There doesn't seem to be

17:07.092 --> 17:09.093
anything else
on your mind these days.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.095
Are you calling me a nympho?

17:11.096 --> 17:12.597
No, I didn't say that.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.098
Well, that's okay.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.098
Go ahead, say it.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.099
Say it, Father Flotsky.

17:16.101 --> 17:17.602
"Corinne, me darling,

17:17.603 --> 17:20.105
you're a cute lass,
but you're a nympho."

17:23.608 --> 17:25.609
If the shoe fits, Corinne...

17:25.611 --> 17:27.612
So you are calling me a nympho.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.113
You just admitted it.

17:29.114 --> 17:30.114
You called me a nympho.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.619
JESSICA: Yoo-hoo!

17:34.620 --> 17:36.120
Come in.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.622
Hello.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.624
I heard you two fighting

17:39.625 --> 17:41.126
and I thought
you'd like some cocoa.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.129
No, thanks.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.631
Corinne?

17:46.632 --> 17:47.632
No, thanks, Ma.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.133
Did you hear that?

17:49.134 --> 17:51.135
The priest called me a nympho.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.638
Nympho?

17:53.639 --> 17:57.141
Is that one
of the Marx Brothers?

17:57.142 --> 18:00.144
I may as well be married
to a eunuch.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.646
Did you hear that?
Eunuch.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.148
I didn't say you were a eunuch.

18:04.149 --> 18:05.650
I said you might as well be one.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.151
I don't see the difference.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.152
You called me a nympho.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.654
No, I didn't.
You called me a eunuch.

18:09.655 --> 18:10.655
No, I didn't.

18:10.656 --> 18:11.656
You didn't?

18:11.657 --> 18:14.158
No.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.159
You want to go to bed now?

18:15.160 --> 18:16.661
I have to finish <i>Leviticus.</i>

18:16.662 --> 18:17.662
Eunuch.

18:17.663 --> 18:18.663
Nympho.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.164
Aha.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.666
Here it is.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.168
"Eunuch."

18:36.682 --> 18:38.182
I don't know
what else to do, Tim.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.184
I mean, I've done everything
I know how.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.185
I've been patient.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.687
I've been angry.

18:42.688 --> 18:43.688
I've been understanding.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.690
I've been obstinate.

18:45.691 --> 18:47.191
So what are you saying, Corinne?

18:47.192 --> 18:48.693
That you want other men?

18:48.694 --> 18:49.694
No.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.196
I don't want other men.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.198
I want you.

18:54.199 --> 18:55.700
Corrine, he's a eunuch.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.205
Ma, why don't you go
make some coffee.

19:01.206 --> 19:02.206
Okay.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.207
Do you suppose

19:03.208 --> 19:05.710
his father was a eunuch too?

19:05.711 --> 19:07.212
Ma...

19:15.721 --> 19:17.222
So...

19:18.724 --> 19:20.225
So...

19:21.727 --> 19:23.729
You want a divorce?

19:25.230 --> 19:26.731
Do you?

19:26.732 --> 19:28.733
No.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.234
Oh.

19:30.235 --> 19:33.238
Me either.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.741
But I think we should get one.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.249
So do I.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.251
Then I guess I should go.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.254
Tim...

19:52.257 --> 19:54.258
You wanted me, Corinne,
and I was a priest.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.762
I wanted you,
but I was a priest,

19:57.763 --> 20:01.766
so I left the church,
now I'm leaving you.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.768
I love the church, Corinne,

20:03.769 --> 20:05.770
and I still do,

20:05.771 --> 20:08.773
and I love you just as much...

20:08.774 --> 20:10.274
but I can't have you.

20:10.275 --> 20:11.776
You can have me.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.277
I'm still here for you.

20:13.278 --> 20:14.278
I can't, Corinne.

20:14.279 --> 20:16.280
As much as want to, I can't.

20:16.281 --> 20:20.785
As much as I love you,
my past won't let me.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.787
I tried,

20:22.788 --> 20:24.790
but I can't undo
all those years.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.293
But I love you.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.797
And I love you...

20:32.798 --> 20:35.300
too much to stay.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.307
I'm going to say goodbye
to my son.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.843
Oh, Ma.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.348
Corinne, darling.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.851
I've lost him.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.353
No, Corinne.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.856
No, you haven't lost him.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.859
He's leaving me.

21:36.361 --> 21:37.361
Darling, you loved him

21:37.362 --> 21:40.364
for something he never was,

21:40.365 --> 21:42.867
something you'd hoped he'd be,

21:42.868 --> 21:47.371
and he loved you the same way.

21:47.372 --> 21:48.873
So you see,

21:48.874 --> 21:53.878
you never really
lost each other,

21:53.879 --> 21:55.379
because in order to do that,

21:55.380 --> 21:57.882
you've got to
find each other first,

21:57.883 --> 22:00.886
and you never did.

22:23.689 --> 22:26.410
ANNOUNCER: <i>Will Millie and Danny
ever have a meaningful relationship?</i>

22:26.411 --> 22:28.412
