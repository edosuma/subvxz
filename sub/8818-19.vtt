WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.961
- I'm sleepy.
What do you want?

00:03.044 --> 00:04.546
- I tried to bring this
up to Agamemnon all day,

00:04.629 --> 00:06.673
but he seemed a little--
- Preoccupied?

00:06.756 --> 00:08.758
Well, the WITS Academy
Headmaster

00:08.842 --> 00:09.509
doesn't have time
for student trivialities,

00:09.592 --> 00:11.594
and neither do I.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.305
Now good night.
- It's about the Dyad tree.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.932
It looks like
it's getting sick again.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.017
- And you're just
bringing this up now?

00:18.101 --> 00:20.061
- Seriously? I've been
trying to say it all day,

00:20.145 --> 00:22.188
but no one would--

00:22.272 --> 00:23.898
listen to me.

00:25.608 --> 00:26.359
Is that...

00:26.443 --> 00:28.987
Ruby's?

00:31.865 --> 00:37.412
- ♪

00:37.495 --> 00:40.582
- Tree sap?

00:40.665 --> 00:43.418
From the Dyad tree?

00:43.501 --> 00:45.295
This is it!

00:45.378 --> 00:49.966
This must be how
Ruby gets her powers!

00:50.049 --> 00:51.968
Not if I can help it.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.639
- I appreciate you bringing
this to my attention,

00:56.723 --> 00:58.308
but you are breaking curfew.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.644
- Isn't this more important
than the Academy rule book?

01:01.728 --> 01:05.899
- Nothing is more important
than the Academy rule book.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.734
What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.195
- I can see you're
hiding something.

01:10.278 --> 01:14.991
- Oh, uh, this is just...
my sleepy time tea.

01:15.074 --> 01:18.661
I like how it warms
my stomach before bed.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.081
- Let me tell you something,
Andrea Futura Doctora Cruz,

01:22.165 --> 01:24.542
you should try
Valerian herbal tea.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.169
It's so soothing.
It makes you sleep like a baby.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.214
- I'll try that.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.090
So, what's wrong?

01:31.174 --> 01:33.760
Leo told me that if the Dyad
tree loses its powers

01:33.843 --> 01:34.969
it could affect
the connection

01:35.053 --> 01:36.679
between my world
and the Magic Realm.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.014
Is it gonna be okay?

01:38.097 --> 01:41.017
- I wouldn't say okay.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.937
In my expert opinion,
which actually isn't expert,

01:44.020 --> 01:45.396
I mean, let's face it,
I'm quite the brain,

01:45.480 --> 01:46.856
but my schooling in Realm
botany is fairly limited.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.192
Though I did take
a night class

01:49.275 --> 01:50.693
on decorating with
house plants--

01:50.777 --> 01:52.195
mainly poinsettias,
lovely little things--

01:52.278 --> 01:54.823
- What? Cameron?

01:54.906 --> 01:57.200
- I believe the tree
is dying.

Oh, Cameron.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.993
You're here?

02:40.076 --> 02:41.911
- Of course--I'm the crisis
management coordinator.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.581
- Crisis management
coordinator?

02:44.664 --> 02:45.707
- During times of crisis,

02:45.790 --> 02:46.499
someone needs to
keep a cool head

02:46.583 --> 02:48.585
and I don't know
if you've heard--

02:48.668 --> 02:49.377
but we're in a crisis!

02:53.047 --> 02:56.134
- Well, Miss Cruz, as it
turns out, you were right.

02:56.217 --> 03:01.431
The Dyad tree is ailing
again--badly, I'm afraid.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.433
The Witches Council
is holding

03:03.516 --> 03:05.310
an emergency meeting
as we speak.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.149
- I think I know why
the tree is sick.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.863
It's tree sap
from the Dyad tree.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.323
Ruby's been using
it to gain powers.

03:25.830 --> 03:29.959
- The sap does, indeed,
possess magical properties.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.377
Where did you get this?

03:31.461 --> 03:34.505
- I found it--
- --in my room, sir.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.424
- In your room?

03:36.507 --> 03:38.676
Explain yourself,
Cameron.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.762
- Yeah, explain
yourself, Cameron.

03:40.845 --> 03:44.807
- I discovered the jar
hidden in the library.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.642
I was gonna bring it
to your attention,

03:45.725 --> 03:47.852
but someone stole
it from my room.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.145
- I didn't steal it.

03:49.228 --> 03:51.064
I only took it
to bring it to you.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.982
- These are serious
accusations.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.027
This better not
be an attempt

03:56.110 --> 03:58.655
at furthering your feud
with Miss Webber.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.323
- I swear. The jar
belongs to Ruby.

04:00.406 --> 04:03.701
She's the one who's been
hurting the Dyad tree.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.536
- [magic whooshing]

04:05.620 --> 04:07.205
- Well...

04:09.916 --> 04:12.043
Oh!
- What's wrong?

04:12.126 --> 04:13.294
- Another report.

04:13.378 --> 04:18.173
Witches in the human world
are beginning to show markings--

04:18.257 --> 04:20.259
just like Miss Alonso.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.804
- Oh, no, Emma.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.515
[groaning] I dropped
my phone in the river.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.017
- River? What riv--oh.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.688
Why do I even bother?

04:31.771 --> 04:34.190
[powers zapping]

04:34.274 --> 04:35.483
There you are.

04:35.566 --> 04:39.278
Inform me as soon as you
hear from the Chosen One.

04:39.362 --> 04:43.157
Now go get ready
for the Magic Melee.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.450
- We're still holding
the Melee, sir?

04:44.534 --> 04:48.371
- Disrupting the final
would only alarm the students.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.374
- What do you mean the thingie
with the wink-wink,

04:51.457 --> 04:53.584
nudge-nudge is now
with you-know-who?

04:53.668 --> 04:55.044
- I know. It's bad.
I'm sorry.

04:55.128 --> 05:00.091
- No, I have no idea
what that means.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.510
- [quietly] The jar with
the tree sap in it--

05:02.593 --> 05:03.636
Agamemnon has it.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.471
- You--

05:05.555 --> 05:07.849
You gave him the tree sap?

05:07.932 --> 05:10.476
- [pounds table]
Of course not!

05:10.560 --> 05:12.687
[quietly] I would never
betray you like that.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.188
But Andi would.

05:14.272 --> 05:18.985
- Oh, that girl...
[groaning]

05:19.068 --> 05:22.613
This is bad.
This is really bad.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.786
Emily needs that sap
to boost her magic.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.247
If we lose the Melee,

05:31.330 --> 05:33.416
we go down to the bottom
of the board--

05:33.499 --> 05:37.545
which means I'll start next
semester with zero points.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.509
Who knows...

05:43.593 --> 05:47.013
my parents might make
me quit the Academy.

05:47.096 --> 05:51.768
That's if Agamemnon
doesn't kick me out.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.312
- Don't worry, Ruby.
I'll think of something.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.277
- We're in big trouble.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.197
- I knew that the day Agamemnon
assigned you to be my Guardian.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.490
- Here's the deal.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.910
Remember the tree sap I was so
generously sharing with you?

06:08.993 --> 06:10.453
It's gone.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.329
So, when the Magic Melee
starts in an hour,

06:11.412 --> 06:14.373
everyone will
know you're powerless.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.875
- I'll be fine.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.418
I don't need
your help anymore.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.836
- I know you could still come
into your full powers,

06:18.920 --> 06:22.006
but, I mean--

06:22.090 --> 06:26.385
You got your own
sap, didn't you?

06:26.469 --> 06:27.512
- Hey!
- Emily!

06:27.595 --> 06:31.349
I need you at the final,
so you'd better show up or--

06:31.432 --> 06:35.978
- Miss Webber.
There you are.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.147
To my office--now!

- ♪

06:58.584 --> 07:00.545

- So, you don't deny that this
canister belongs to you?

07:05.424 --> 07:07.009
- No, sir--I keep
iced tea in it

07:07.093 --> 07:09.554
when we practice outside.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.806
Gotta keep

anything else in it?

07:14.809 --> 07:18.688
- Yes.

07:18.771 --> 07:23.526
Once I used it to bring
bonbons to practice--

07:23.609 --> 07:26.529
you know, as a reward
for Emily and Ethan.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.698
They work so hard.

07:28.781 --> 07:32.201
- Hm, I'm not so convinced,
Miss Webber.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.663
There's only one way
to find out

07:35.746 --> 07:37.373
if you're really
telling the truth.

07:37.456 --> 07:41.002
- Sir! May I remind you
that Truth Spells

07:41.085 --> 07:42.378
are against Academy policy.

07:42.461 --> 07:44.213
I would hate to see
you getting into trouble.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.007
- Getting into trouble
with whom?

07:46.090 --> 07:47.258
I run the Academy.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.218
- But, sir, how can we expect
others to follow the rules,

07:49.302 --> 07:50.887
if we don't follow
them ourselves?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.388
- Oh, so be it.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.347
I will file a special
request with the Council

07:53.431 --> 07:56.267
to employ a Truth
Spell in this matter.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.895
You may leave now,
Miss Webber.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.689
- Of course, sir.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.235
- I want you to keep
an eye on her, Cameron.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.362

Ruby, wait up!

If they win today,
they're on top of the board.

08:21.709 --> 08:22.418
- Think positive.

08:22.501 --> 08:25.087
Think about what
we're gonna do

- Spell Armor?

such a huge advantage.

Round one will be
