WEBVTT

00:10.368 --> 00:12.702
Michael Scott, as seen on TV.

00:12.770 --> 00:14.237
I saw you on the news,

00:14.305 --> 00:17.841
And I want to pinch
your tiny wiener.

00:17.908 --> 00:20.510
It's packer! - Oh!

00:20.578 --> 00:23.696
Pack-man, I thought
you were a girl.

00:23.764 --> 00:25.860
Apparently,
there are allegations

00:25.927 --> 00:28.491
That sabre printer
can cause a fire...

00:28.559 --> 00:31.888
So they asked me to give
a statement to the press.

00:31.956 --> 00:34.821
I'm like, "what? All right."

00:34.889 --> 00:38.598
So I do it.
It's on TV last night.

00:38.667 --> 00:42.165
And it's in the paper today,
and it's online.

00:42.233 --> 00:46.264
And then I call froggy 98.
7, their request line,

00:46.332 --> 00:48.130
And I talk to the host
about it on the air.

00:48.198 --> 00:51.197
It's like, come on,
people, enough.

00:51.265 --> 00:53.532
Everybody, we are at defcon 5.

00:53.601 --> 00:56.603
I am officially the second
most watched clip of the day

00:56.671 --> 00:58.774
On the wbre news site.

00:58.842 --> 01:00.008
What's number one?

01:00.076 --> 01:02.109
Oh, that teacher who
was wrongfully accused

01:02.176 --> 01:03.276
Of being a pedophile.

01:03.344 --> 01:05.876
Now, we cannot let the
pedophile win again.

01:05.943 --> 01:08.078
I would like you all
to go to the website

01:08.146 --> 01:09.581
And watch my clip 11 times.

01:09.649 --> 01:11.049
So instead of working,
you want--

01:11.116 --> 01:12.617
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay.

01:12.685 --> 01:15.088
Come on.

01:15.156 --> 01:16.256
Get it up.

01:16.324 --> 01:17.957
That's what--

01:18.025 --> 01:19.359
Let's do it.

01:21.529 --> 01:24.765
Did you see this report that
the zoo got a baby otter?

01:24.833 --> 01:26.099
It's on the same site.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.368
Aw, it's kissing its mommy.

01:28.435 --> 01:30.769
Michael, you have to see this.
It's like the cutest thing ever.

01:32.505 --> 01:34.538
Really? A baby otter?

01:34.606 --> 01:37.941
Okay, um, count me
in as "who cares?"

01:38.008 --> 01:41.276
It's not even that interesting,
a baby otter.

01:41.344 --> 01:43.478
It can't even stand up.

01:43.545 --> 01:46.012
It's trying to stand up.

01:48.015 --> 01:50.149
There it goes.

The Office - 6x25 "Whistleblower"
Aired on may 20, 2010

02:16.045 --> 02:18.412
Howdy.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.581
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

02:20.649 --> 02:22.617
Jo, we were not expecting you.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.419
Y'all, no doubt,
know why I'm here.

02:24.486 --> 02:25.487
No.

02:25.554 --> 02:28.356
Turns out our
printers are famous.

02:28.424 --> 02:30.124
They're all over the news.

02:30.192 --> 02:32.626
It's an interesting story.

02:32.693 --> 02:37.464
Cheap, foreign printers
attacking innocent Americans.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.633
Well, actually,
the--the real story

02:39.701 --> 02:41.434
Isn't quite as racy.

02:41.502 --> 02:45.004
But, uh...

02:45.072 --> 02:47.140
Let's give it a go.

02:47.207 --> 02:49.508
Jo, I think that I
know what happened.

02:49.576 --> 02:51.443
I'm not sure you do, Teddy bear.

02:51.511 --> 02:54.513
Well, now I think I might not.

02:54.581 --> 02:56.448
Not long ago,
we discovered a defect

02:56.516 --> 02:58.017
In one of our printers.

02:58.085 --> 03:00.086
So we got a software patch
and fixed it right up,

03:00.154 --> 03:01.554
Just like that.

03:01.622 --> 03:03.889
I don't know how it works.

03:03.957 --> 03:07.225
Just as we were about
to send out a letter

03:07.293 --> 03:08.827
To our affected customers,

03:08.894 --> 03:10.995
Giving 'em free toner,

03:11.063 --> 03:12.530
And we keep 'em happy,

03:12.598 --> 03:15.199
But somebody here, they liked
that first story better--

03:15.267 --> 03:17.768
The one where we
lose half our clients

03:17.836 --> 03:21.539
For no damn good reason!

03:21.607 --> 03:24.142
Whoever it was who
talked to the press,

03:24.209 --> 03:25.643
Just come forward, please.

03:25.711 --> 03:28.512
Jo, I can assure you it
was no one in this office.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.514
- Can you, now?
- Absolutely.

03:30.582 --> 03:35.151
Anyone who talked to the press,
please raise your hand.

03:35.219 --> 03:36.786
Put your hand up, Norma Rae.

03:36.854 --> 03:39.355
If you say anything,
so help me God,

03:39.423 --> 03:41.824
I'll break off the
temples of your glasses

03:41.892 --> 03:43.225
And stick 'em in
your eye sockets.

03:43.293 --> 03:44.727
So unfair.

03:44.794 --> 03:46.661
Even if I thought
that our printers

03:46.729 --> 03:48.296
Killed baby seals,

03:48.364 --> 03:50.732
I would not be a whistle-blower.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.300
The bernards, for generations,

03:52.368 --> 03:54.403
Have silenced whistle-blowers.

03:54.470 --> 03:56.171
That's how we made
all our money.

03:56.239 --> 03:59.008
Woody Guthrie wrote
a song about us.

03:59.075 --> 04:01.143
? old Mr. Bernard ?

04:01.211 --> 04:03.111
? old Mr. Bernard ?

04:03.179 --> 04:06.081
? who have you silenced today? ?

04:06.149 --> 04:09.151
This is a little form,
says, "I did not do it."

04:09.219 --> 04:11.519
There is no reason for
anyone here to sign this,

04:11.587 --> 04:13.922
Because I know everything there
is to know about these people.

04:13.990 --> 04:15.423
I know when their birthdays are.

04:15.491 --> 04:17.425
I know what their
favorite kind of cake is.

04:17.493 --> 04:19.760
I know what color
streamers they like.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.428
All that's just birthday
information, Michael.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.031
Yes, yes. But it shows
a bigger picture.

04:24.099 --> 04:25.399
Why don't you come with me?

04:25.467 --> 04:27.401
We'll start out with the honcho.

04:27.469 --> 04:29.236
What you say? - Okay.

04:29.304 --> 04:30.904
When mama was working
as a prison guard

04:30.972 --> 04:35.009
And something went missing,
she'd ask one question--

04:35.077 --> 04:37.878
What do we do when we
find the guilty party?

04:37.946 --> 04:40.014
And if they said,
"come down on 'em

04:40.081 --> 04:42.116
With that swift
hammer of justice..."

04:42.183 --> 04:43.451
Innocent.

04:43.518 --> 04:46.587
A clear conscience
don't need no mercy.

04:46.655 --> 04:49.724
But if they said,
"officer Bessie, well,

04:49.792 --> 04:52.928
They may have had a reason,
blah, blah, blah, blah..."

04:52.995 --> 04:56.798
Well, nine times out of ten,
that's the anus they checked.

04:56.866 --> 04:59.000
So say we catch
this whistle-blower,

04:59.068 --> 05:00.402
What do you think I
should do with 'em?

05:00.469 --> 05:02.137
We should give 'em
a one-way ticket

05:02.205 --> 05:04.706
To Montego Bay...

05:04.774 --> 05:06.308
Where they keep
all the Al-Qaeda.

05:06.376 --> 05:10.212
Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.313
Yes.

05:11.381 --> 05:12.581
You put 'em in jail
for a long time.

05:12.649 --> 05:14.049
You put 'em in jail for
as long as you can.

05:14.117 --> 05:16.218
Well, I guess we're
all right, Michael.

05:16.286 --> 05:17.453
I want these people
to really pay.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.055
I want 'em to suffer. - Mm-hmm.

05:20.123 --> 05:22.257
I'd prefer it if they died,
'cause it's not right.

05:22.325 --> 05:23.492
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:23.559 --> 05:25.895
- Hey, Dwight.
- Hey, I.T. Guy.

05:25.962 --> 05:27.897
You mind if I get in
there for a second?

05:27.965 --> 05:31.834
Oh, sure thing. Go ahead.

05:31.902 --> 05:33.069
Wha--unh!

05:33.137 --> 05:34.671
Dwight, what the hell?

05:34.738 --> 05:36.740
- Apache persuasion hold-
- that's the hell.

05:36.807 --> 05:38.174
What are you doing
to my computer?

05:38.242 --> 05:40.110
The lawyers are searching
our hard drives

05:40.177 --> 05:41.578
For information on the leak.

05:41.646 --> 05:42.779
Thanks a lot, Big Brother.

05:42.847 --> 05:44.147
You're with Big Brother?

05:44.215 --> 05:46.116
Okay, go ahead.
I got nothing to hide.

05:46.183 --> 05:48.017
Wait, are they searching
all our computers?

05:48.085 --> 05:49.285
Yeah.

05:49.353 --> 05:53.522
I already got to yours, Kev.

05:53.590 --> 05:55.424
No, that's cool.

05:55.492 --> 05:58.461
Some-- sometimes I run.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.463
I'm a runner.

06:00.530 --> 06:02.298
Everybody knows it was Andy.

06:02.366 --> 06:04.600
And it is not fair for
us all to take the fall

06:04.668 --> 06:06.035
For his big, stupid mouth.

06:06.103 --> 06:08.270
That's ridiculous, Angela.

06:08.338 --> 06:10.005
And like I'm gonna believe
one of his "spermed" lovers.

06:10.073 --> 06:12.708
Look, he's been complaining
about this for a while.

06:12.775 --> 06:14.242
It's not crazy.

06:18.113 --> 06:20.081
Ugh.

06:20.148 --> 06:22.183
- Okay, Dwight.
- Hold that thought.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.318
I don't want to waste your time,
and I wouldn't dare waste mine.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.686
I didn't do it.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.888
Now, I don't know
exactly who did it,

06:27.955 --> 06:31.525
But I have a list right here.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.528
You should fire the
following people.

06:34.596 --> 06:36.163
Well, I'm inclined
to believe you.

06:36.231 --> 06:37.498
Why would I disparage a company

06:37.566 --> 06:39.433
That has made me rich
beyond my wildest dreams?

06:39.501 --> 06:40.935
Yeah, I noticed you've
has a great year.

06:41.003 --> 06:42.503
Good boy. -

06:42.571 --> 06:44.606
You turning that money
into more money?

06:47.109 --> 06:49.711
are you referring to alchemy?

06:49.779 --> 06:52.147
I don't like to tell a man
what to do with his money,

06:52.215 --> 06:53.515
But if you ain't
investing in property,

06:53.582 --> 06:54.949
Then you're dumber than a dummy.

06:55.017 --> 06:56.751
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.

06:56.819 --> 06:59.887
Well, buy property.
That's my advice.

07:01.490 --> 07:03.792
Is there something that you
would like to say to me...

07:03.859 --> 07:07.028
- Uh...
- About talking to the press?

07:07.096 --> 07:09.597
- I didn't do that! Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

07:09.665 --> 07:11.700
I-I... Didn't do it.

07:11.768 --> 07:12.801
I don't believe you.

07:12.869 --> 07:15.203
I swear on the
graves of my parents,

07:15.271 --> 07:17.138
Who aren't even dead yet.
That's a little much.

07:17.206 --> 07:18.372
All right. All right. All right.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.241
I don't care.
That's how much I swear.

07:20.308 --> 07:21.575
Okay, I believe you.
I believe you.

07:21.643 --> 07:23.544
How come no one's
giving Darryl any crap?

07:23.611 --> 07:26.680
He was more bothered
about it than me.

07:28.116 --> 07:31.385
Did you tell anyone
outside of this office

07:31.453 --> 07:35.656
That the printers
were catching on fire?

07:35.724 --> 07:36.791
Yeah, I did.

07:36.859 --> 07:39.761
I-I was talking to
this girl at a bar.

07:39.829 --> 07:40.996
Oh, no, no, no...

07:41.064 --> 07:43.733
I think she could
sense my sadness.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.368
I didn't find out
till later she--

07:45.435 --> 07:47.170
<i>She was a copy editor
at the trib.</i>

07:47.237 --> 07:48.171
Oh, my God.

07:48.239 --> 07:50.940
Was she cute? - No.

07:51.008 --> 07:52.408
Oh, God, Darryl!

07:52.476 --> 07:53.809
I basically swore up and down

07:53.877 --> 07:55.911
That none of my
employees did it.

07:55.979 --> 07:58.313
And then I find out that
one of my best ones did.

07:58.381 --> 08:01.416
And now he's probably
gonna get fired for it.

08:01.483 --> 08:03.851
And if that is not
poetic justice,

08:03.919 --> 08:05.720
I don't know what is.

08:09.048 --> 08:10.415
Sounds like you were as
blindsided by this as I was.

08:10.483 --> 08:12.284
I was.

08:12.351 --> 08:13.652
We didn't find anything
on your computer.

08:13.719 --> 08:14.819
Good.

08:14.887 --> 08:16.655
Except this.

08:16.722 --> 08:20.158
Oh, this is, uh,
just a mystery novel

08:20.226 --> 08:21.426
That I've been working on.

08:21.494 --> 08:23.829
I know what it is.
I skimmed the first chapter.

08:23.896 --> 08:25.164
I'm just curious--

08:25.231 --> 08:27.232
Why would a man who hates people

08:27.300 --> 08:29.902
Want to have a
relationship with a maid?

08:29.969 --> 08:32.104
Oh, uh, I don't know.

08:32.171 --> 08:33.972
They way I look at it,
there's only one of two reasons.

08:34.039 --> 08:37.575
He knows a secret about her
that she doesn't know herself,

08:37.643 --> 08:41.212
Or he wants to use her services

08:41.280 --> 08:43.114
To mop up after a murder.

08:43.182 --> 08:45.984
Oh, yes.

08:46.051 --> 08:48.686
Write your own damn novel.

08:48.754 --> 08:50.422
It was me.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.590
What was you?

08:52.658 --> 08:53.992
You were the leak?

08:54.060 --> 08:55.894
Okay, I'm talking to
this woman at day care...

08:55.962 --> 08:57.362
Uh-huh.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.531
She's telling me all about
her amazing trip to Vietnam.

08:59.599 --> 09:00.799
I have nothing.

09:00.867 --> 09:03.035
I tell her our printers
catch on fire spontaneously.

09:03.103 --> 09:04.604
- Why'd you do that?
- Her husband's a reporter.

09:04.671 --> 09:05.939
Yeah.

09:06.006 --> 09:07.507
So now everyone hates Andy,

09:07.575 --> 09:09.076
And it's this whole mess,
and I don't know what to do.

09:09.144 --> 09:11.178
Okay, just relax.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.780
Just need to relax.

09:12.848 --> 09:17.185
I could tell Jo,
or I could tell Michael.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.686
This is a very good idea.

09:18.754 --> 09:20.688
This is good--let's get
all the bad ideas out now.

09:20.755 --> 09:21.789
Flush 'em out.

09:21.856 --> 09:23.123
You leaked it?

09:23.191 --> 09:25.693
I don't know what to do.
Do I go tell Jo or...

09:25.760 --> 09:27.428
I don't want everyone to keep
blaming the wrong person.

09:27.496 --> 09:30.931
I don't know what the
best plan is, Pam.

09:30.999 --> 09:32.733
Oh, God.

09:32.801 --> 09:34.435
My mind is going a mile an hour.

09:34.503 --> 09:37.338
- That fast?
- Ohh...

09:37.406 --> 09:39.040
Two whistle-blowers!

09:39.107 --> 09:40.775
Two.

09:40.842 --> 09:43.044
I always thought Darryl
and Pam might get me fired

09:43.111 --> 09:45.179
For something I said.

09:46.448 --> 09:47.715
Yeah?

09:56.524 --> 09:58.959
I weirdly know exactly
what you're saying to me.

09:59.027 --> 10:00.727
So I'll see you in Meredith's
van in five minutes.

10:00.795 --> 10:03.696
Yeah, you didn't need
to actually say--

10:03.764 --> 10:06.899
I have never seen so
many parking tickets.

10:06.967 --> 10:08.934
All right,
this is just messed up.

10:09.002 --> 10:10.435
No, you know what's messed up?

10:10.503 --> 10:12.637
This situation all up in hee-yah

10:12.705 --> 10:13.938
Is what's messed up.

10:14.006 --> 10:15.740
We need to brainstorm.
We need to get out of this.

10:15.808 --> 10:17.975
Brain hurricane-- come on,
think.

10:18.043 --> 10:19.944
What do we got? - Um...

10:20.012 --> 10:22.113
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

10:22.181 --> 10:24.316
- We're not going for yogurt.
- It's okay. She's cool.

10:24.383 --> 10:25.817
She also whistle-blew.

10:25.885 --> 10:28.620
Guys, I couldn't help it.
It is so boring where we work.

10:28.688 --> 10:30.823
I mean, it's as
interesting as a morgue.

10:30.890 --> 10:32.592
It might be less
interesting than a morgue.

10:32.659 --> 10:35.061
Hey, hey! It's as
interesting as a morgue.

10:35.129 --> 10:37.430
Of course I'm the leak.
I think I tweeted it.

10:37.498 --> 10:39.165
I can't control what
I say to people.

10:39.233 --> 10:40.266
I spend the whole day talking.

10:40.334 --> 10:42.001
I mean, I video chat, I skype,

10:42.069 --> 10:44.504
I text, I tweet,
I phone, I woof.

10:44.572 --> 10:46.039
"woof" is a site
that I'm launching

10:46.107 --> 10:47.674
To be the last word
in social networking.

10:47.742 --> 10:49.176
For just $12.99 a month,

10:49.243 --> 10:51.178
Woof links up all your
communication portals

10:51.246 --> 10:52.479
So you are always within reach.

10:52.547 --> 10:54.214
It's part of the dog pack,
as I call it.

10:54.282 --> 10:56.883
But look, why tell you

10:56.951 --> 10:59.852
When I can show you?

10:59.920 --> 11:02.655
I just sent myself a woof.

11:04.624 --> 11:06.392
Ryan, you have a
woof on line one.

11:06.459 --> 11:09.361
Thank you, Erin. Woof!

11:09.428 --> 11:10.829
Okay, here's what we do.

11:10.896 --> 11:13.698
I say we just smash
all the computers.

11:13.766 --> 11:15.266
We destroy the evidence-
no evidence, no case.

11:15.333 --> 11:18.803
Wouldn't we get fired for
smashing all the computers?

11:18.870 --> 11:20.404
No--okay, not all the computers,

11:20.472 --> 11:21.772
Just our computers.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.907
That idea sucks.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.508
I don't think
that's a good idea.

11:24.576 --> 11:25.809
Just don't say no!

11:25.877 --> 11:28.613
Mike, you know you don't
have to turn us all in.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.015
All you need is one scapegoat.

11:31.082 --> 11:33.351
Uh, if you turn me in,
I'm turning in Darryl.

11:33.419 --> 11:36.554
That's just what we need,
another black man in prison.

11:36.622 --> 11:38.657
You know, let's just-
nobody's going to prison.

11:38.724 --> 11:41.793
Okay? Um... All right, Michael,

11:41.861 --> 11:44.329
You need to convince
Jo to go easy on us,

11:44.397 --> 11:47.033
And then we'll all confess
once we know our jobs are safe.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.401
Okay.

11:48.468 --> 11:50.703
You can count on me.

11:50.771 --> 11:53.473
Let me give you a hand.

11:53.541 --> 11:55.475
Ready?

11:57.411 --> 11:59.045
oh, shoot.

11:59.113 --> 12:01.847
You got it? - Got it? No, no.

12:01.915 --> 12:03.182
Dwight schrute.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.218
The property you're looking
at is in great shape.

12:05.285 --> 12:08.086
By the way, it has a very
spacious basement office.

12:08.154 --> 12:10.055
Basement office?

12:10.123 --> 12:12.357
You mean like a lair?

12:12.425 --> 12:14.059
hey, Jo.

12:14.127 --> 12:16.061
Michael.

12:16.129 --> 12:17.997
I was thinking about our
little leak problem.

12:18.064 --> 12:19.565
I was up all lunch

12:19.632 --> 12:21.733
Thinking about what we
should do to this individual.

12:21.801 --> 12:24.170
You know that I
think we should do?

12:24.237 --> 12:27.407
We make 'em come to work,
and we work 'em.

12:27.475 --> 12:30.977
And we make 'em sit next to all
the people they screwed over.

12:31.045 --> 12:33.580
And--and we pay 'em,

12:33.648 --> 12:36.182
But we make 'em feel like

12:36.250 --> 12:38.085
They did something really wrong.

12:38.152 --> 12:39.152
The one question I have is,

12:39.220 --> 12:40.721
Do we give 'em a
Christmas bonus?

12:40.788 --> 12:42.089
I say...

12:42.156 --> 12:43.557
Yes. It's Christmas.

12:43.625 --> 12:46.627
But right after,
they're back in the thick of it.

12:46.694 --> 12:49.697
Michael Scott...

12:49.764 --> 12:51.398
What do you know?

12:51.466 --> 12:53.733
What?

12:53.801 --> 12:55.436
it doesn't matter what I know.

12:55.503 --> 12:56.904
If it doesn't matter,
then tell me.

12:56.972 --> 12:59.106
- Why?
- Because I want to deal with it

12:59.174 --> 13:00.274
The way I deal with it.

13:00.342 --> 13:04.044
Well, deal with this.

13:04.112 --> 13:05.912
Empathize with me for a moment.

13:05.980 --> 13:08.248
I came up here
with a big problem,

13:08.316 --> 13:09.682
And now I got a branch manager

13:09.750 --> 13:12.952
Who's giving me the
silent treatment.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.287
Speak to me.

13:15.523 --> 13:17.858
Speak.

13:21.195 --> 13:23.963
Come with me. - What?

13:26.700 --> 13:28.400
Are you leaving?

13:28.468 --> 13:31.303
Should I continue with
the investigation?

13:43.903 --> 13:45.303
Are you gonna kill me?

13:51.210 --> 13:52.678
I just need you to come by later

13:52.746 --> 13:54.146
And sign a few forms. - Okay.

13:54.214 --> 13:56.282
What time works for you?

13:56.350 --> 13:59.986
Mr. Schrute, what time works?

14:02.823 --> 14:04.357
Cancel it.

14:04.425 --> 14:07.560
I want you to make an offer
at 1725 slough Avenue.

14:07.627 --> 14:10.562
Make 'em an offer
they can't refuse.

14:10.630 --> 14:13.699
No, on second thought,
lowball 'em.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.601
Don't call me till you have it.

14:15.669 --> 14:18.504
But--

14:18.572 --> 14:20.306
Are we going someplace far away?

14:20.373 --> 14:23.108
I know you said no
questions, but...

14:25.512 --> 14:29.481
I have an early dinner
that I need to get to...

14:29.549 --> 14:31.517
With the chief of police.

14:31.584 --> 14:35.120
I'm very relieved to
learn it wasn't you.

14:35.187 --> 14:37.655
All right, uh... Stan,
you're up.

14:37.723 --> 14:38.923
It wasn't me.

14:38.991 --> 14:42.593
What a rich timbre
your voice has.

14:42.661 --> 14:46.697
Okay, I am prepared to
conclude the investigation.

14:46.764 --> 14:48.832
- And?
- You did it.

14:48.900 --> 14:52.435
What? Based on what?

14:52.503 --> 14:54.003
Uh, just all the evidence.

14:54.071 --> 14:56.739
And it really seems
like it was you.

14:56.807 --> 14:58.841
Can we all agree to say
that it was Andy for now

14:58.909 --> 15:01.009
And sit with it,
see how it feels?

15:01.077 --> 15:02.545
- All right. Sounds good.
- Okay.

15:02.612 --> 15:04.313
Guys, I think that
seems a little unfair.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.549
I mean, I feel like we don't
definitely know it was Andy.

15:06.617 --> 15:07.984
Yeah, you know?

15:08.052 --> 15:10.521
I mean, for all we know,
it could have been...

15:10.588 --> 15:11.855
Jim.

15:11.923 --> 15:12.990
Really?

15:13.057 --> 15:15.226
- Michael...
- I have rights.

15:15.294 --> 15:16.427
Let's just talk.

15:16.495 --> 15:18.096
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

15:18.164 --> 15:21.533
Honey, you don't seem
like your normal self.

15:21.601 --> 15:24.770
Well, I'm going through a
little bit of a rough patch.

15:24.837 --> 15:26.738
Mama Jo knew there
was something up.

15:26.805 --> 15:29.373
The whole year, actually.

15:29.441 --> 15:31.008
My favorite restaurant
closed down.

15:31.076 --> 15:33.176
Oh, I hate that.

15:33.244 --> 15:36.112
And my new favorite
restaurant sucks.

15:38.649 --> 15:40.717
I bought a video
camera last year,

15:40.784 --> 15:42.218
And I was looking at the tapes,

15:42.286 --> 15:44.687
And there were only,
like, 12 minutes

15:44.755 --> 15:48.424
That I felt was worth
taping the whole year.

15:48.492 --> 15:51.661
And most of that was just
birds in my condo complex.

15:51.729 --> 15:54.964
What is that?

15:55.032 --> 15:57.534
And I miss Holly.

15:57.602 --> 15:59.203
Who's Holly?

15:59.270 --> 16:02.506
Holly flax,
from the Nashua branch...

16:02.573 --> 16:03.840
Best h.R. Rep

16:03.908 --> 16:06.410
That Dunder Mifflin
has ever seen.

16:08.780 --> 16:10.848
It's not been a blockbuster
year for me financially.

16:10.916 --> 16:13.451
My blockbuster stock is down.

16:13.519 --> 16:17.055
I think that the
real question is,

16:17.123 --> 16:18.957
Who is the whistle-blower?

16:19.025 --> 16:20.792
Oh, Jesus.

16:20.860 --> 16:22.394
I may have heard
from an old client,

16:22.461 --> 16:24.862
And I may have immediately
started spreading the news

16:24.930 --> 16:27.564
To other clients and
potential clients, yeah.

16:27.632 --> 16:29.199
But I'm not here
to talk about that.

16:29.267 --> 16:31.634
I am here to talk about "
suck it."

16:31.702 --> 16:32.768
Suck it--

16:32.836 --> 16:36.004
Gabe, I told you all
about the printers.

16:36.072 --> 16:37.372
I mean, it could be you, Gabe.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.174
That man has a point.
Yes, it's totally obvious.

16:39.241 --> 16:42.678
I think we all can agree that
it's either Gabe or Angela.

16:42.745 --> 16:46.248
It's Angela. Get her, boys.

16:46.316 --> 16:47.684
Hey, guys, uh,
sorry to interrupt.

16:47.751 --> 16:49.152
I just wanted to say
good-bye to everyone.

16:49.220 --> 16:50.853
Through "teach for America,"

16:50.921 --> 16:52.522
I'm gonna go down to
Detroit and teach, uh,

16:52.590 --> 16:53.590
Inner-city kids about computers.

16:53.658 --> 16:55.092
Uh, not now.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.660
Oh, yeah, it's just my friends
are out in the car waiting,

16:56.728 --> 16:58.129
So I thought I would...

16:58.196 --> 16:59.931
Phyllis, what's this
guy's name again?

16:59.999 --> 17:02.367
I don't know.
Is it "shadow" or "Garth"?

17:02.434 --> 17:03.668
It's something weird. I--

17:03.735 --> 17:05.002
My name is Nick!

17:05.069 --> 17:08.673
Okay, well, "nick,
" we're in a meeting.

17:08.741 --> 17:09.906
Okay, look, I get it, people.

17:09.974 --> 17:12.109
I'm the lame I.T.
Guy, and everybody hates me.

17:12.176 --> 17:14.345
Hey, listen, man,
you can't take it personally.

17:14.413 --> 17:15.378
You called me "man"?

17:15.446 --> 17:17.147
I just said my name just now.

17:17.215 --> 17:18.182
Did you forget it already?

17:18.250 --> 17:20.351
No...

17:20.417 --> 17:21.518
Sport.

17:21.586 --> 17:24.021
you guys have 15 parties a week.

17:24.088 --> 17:25.989
You can't learn my name? - Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:26.056 --> 17:28.324
Hey, I.T. Guy,
here's the story, champ.

17:28.392 --> 17:30.926
None of us have spent a lot of
time getting to know you, okay?

17:30.994 --> 17:33.963
We liked the last guy, sadiq,
because he kept to himself.

17:34.030 --> 17:35.897
And we also thought he might
have been a terrorist.

17:35.965 --> 17:38.199
You know what? I'm gonna leave
you with one other thought.

17:38.267 --> 17:39.667
Inner-city kids use computers

17:39.735 --> 17:41.836
For two things-- games and porn.

17:41.904 --> 17:43.171
So good luck wasting
your life...

17:43.239 --> 17:45.640
Lurch. - Thank you
so much for that.

17:45.708 --> 17:47.509
I saw all your hard drives,

17:47.577 --> 17:49.479
And guess what-
you're not a photographer.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.981
And you definitely can't
fit into a size two.

17:52.049 --> 17:53.316
Darryl, man, you're on Facebook.

17:53.383 --> 17:55.184
Why you been telling people
you're not on Facebook?

17:55.252 --> 17:57.153
People want to be
your friend, man!

17:57.220 --> 17:59.922
All right, and, you, this guy--

17:59.990 --> 18:01.290
You're the one who
told the press.

18:01.358 --> 18:02.558
You wrote an email
to the editor.

18:02.626 --> 18:05.094
I saw it, and I also
saw a quicktime movie

18:05.162 --> 18:07.264
Of your little printer fire
test on your hard drive.

18:07.332 --> 18:08.765
This guy's the snitch.
He's the snitch.

18:08.833 --> 18:12.736
So that's it. Check it out.

18:12.804 --> 18:15.874
We're gonna believe that guy?

18:15.941 --> 18:18.243
When I was growing up,
there was nothing better

18:18.311 --> 18:21.346
Than being a big ol'
business tycoon.

18:21.414 --> 18:22.647
Mm.

18:22.715 --> 18:24.482
And I thought I'd break
that glass ceiling.

18:24.550 --> 18:28.720
I'd be a hero to all those
little girls out there...

18:28.788 --> 18:30.556
And they'd make a
Barbie out of me.

18:30.623 --> 18:31.590
Hmm.

18:31.658 --> 18:36.396
I hate that I sell
cheap printers.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.698
I do.

18:38.766 --> 18:41.168
But if I have to go out
there in front of the press

18:41.235 --> 18:44.237
And make one of them
public-apology recalls,

18:44.305 --> 18:46.139
I mean...

18:46.207 --> 18:49.209
That's all I'll ever
be remembered for.

18:49.276 --> 18:52.211
Nobody will want to
play with my Barbie.

18:54.415 --> 18:57.817
You know, I would be willing,
under the right circumstances,

18:57.885 --> 18:59.519
To do that for you.

18:59.587 --> 19:03.122
Oh, honey, surely
you don't want that.

19:03.190 --> 19:06.659
I-I surely do.

19:06.727 --> 19:08.461
And don't call me honey.

19:14.535 --> 19:15.735
<i>Airplane ii.</i>

19:15.803 --> 19:19.339
I'm about to buy this
building, you know.

19:19.407 --> 19:21.374
You don't say.

19:21.442 --> 19:23.810
I own a 1/8 share
on a rental property

19:23.878 --> 19:24.978
Down in Pittston.

19:25.046 --> 19:27.915
Well, I'm 1/8 proud of you.

19:29.318 --> 19:32.221
Enjoy that chair for now...

19:32.288 --> 19:35.758
Because pretty soon you
will be on your feet,

19:35.826 --> 19:37.960
Like Buckingham Palace.

19:42.867 --> 19:44.767
Hey, Phyllis,
have you seen my bag?

19:44.835 --> 19:46.769
Mm.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.937
You deserve it.

19:49.005 --> 19:52.740
Look, I didn't want houses
and schools to burn down

19:52.808 --> 19:55.342
And children to die.

19:55.410 --> 19:57.577
Does that make me a hero?

19:57.645 --> 20:01.347
No, it does not!

20:01.415 --> 20:04.618
Well, it doesn't make me the
worst guy in the world either.

20:04.686 --> 20:07.154
It does!

20:07.221 --> 20:10.090
- Andy?
- Hey.

20:10.157 --> 20:13.960
I wanted to say that I think
it was very brave of you

20:14.028 --> 20:16.830
To go to the press.

20:20.769 --> 20:23.071
Uh...

20:23.139 --> 20:24.139
Thanks.

20:24.206 --> 20:28.044
Yeah, you know...

20:28.112 --> 20:29.979
It just seemed like
the right thing to do.

20:30.047 --> 20:31.047
Yeah.

20:36.821 --> 20:38.589
"we at sabre have
betrayed the trust

20:38.656 --> 20:40.624
"that we have built
with our customers.

20:40.692 --> 20:42.358
"we regret our slow response

20:42.426 --> 20:44.961
"and our lapse in
candor and judgment.

20:45.029 --> 20:47.697
"at this time,
we are issuing a full recall

20:47.765 --> 20:50.333
"of all sabre gh400 printers.

20:50.401 --> 20:53.569
"we will not rest until
this problem is solved.

20:53.636 --> 20:55.671
There will be no questions."

20:55.738 --> 20:57.706
Are there any questions?
