00:12.380 --> 00:13.947
-(car horn honks)
-(indistinct chatter)

00:14.048 --> 00:16.484
MULLHULLAND:
Citizens of Denver,

00:16.584 --> 00:19.787
we are in the middle
of an environmental crisis.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.723
The winters are bringing
less and less snow.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.293
And now, we are facing a drought

00:25.393 --> 00:28.529
due to the effects
of Global ManBearPig.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.030
-A drought?
-(overlapping chatter)

00:30.131 --> 00:32.166
-What? No.
-ManBearPig?
-What? ManBearPig?

00:32.266 --> 00:36.003
ALL of Denver's water comes from
streams up in the mountains,

00:36.104 --> 00:39.740
but now, ManBearPig
has decimated these areas

00:39.840 --> 00:42.343
and wreaked havoc
on the upper mountain streams.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.413
And so, effective immediately,

00:45.513 --> 00:46.914
we are declaring a drought

00:47.014 --> 00:49.183
and cutting back
on all the city's water.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.985
-No!
-You can't do that!
-(overlapping shouting)

00:52.086 --> 00:54.555
What about our
homeowners' association rules?

00:54.655 --> 00:57.958
Some of us are required
to have nice, green lawns.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.393
You expect us to have

00:59.493 --> 01:00.828
-nice, brown lawns?
-(overlapping shouting)

01:00.928 --> 01:04.565
I own 12 golf courses
in the Denver Metro area.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.268
You're not cutting down
on my damn water.

01:07.368 --> 01:10.338
Have you all forgotten
about the Pi Pi?

01:10.438 --> 01:13.574
I have Denver's
largest water park.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.777
All water parks are 50% pee

01:16.877 --> 01:19.247
and 50% water.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.915
You-you can't forget
about a Pi Pi.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.785
Nobody wants to lose the water,
but we're in a drought.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.787
-(shouting stops)
-MULHULLAND: There simply isn't

01:26.887 --> 01:29.757
enough water coming to Denver
from up in the mountains.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.692
And the water up there
is being used

01:31.792 --> 01:33.361
for farms and agriculture.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.730
What kind of agriculture?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.733
* *

01:41.502 --> 01:44.272
* Da, da, da, da,
da, da, da, da *

01:44.372 --> 01:45.573
* Da, da, da, da. *

01:45.673 --> 01:47.208
How's it looking?

01:47.308 --> 01:49.510
They still look dry.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.646
Okay, then I'm gonna
open the reserves.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.583
* If you ain't taking care
of business *

01:55.683 --> 01:59.287
* This you must expect... *

01:59.387 --> 02:01.121
Yeah!

02:01.222 --> 02:03.857
* When it's wet *

02:03.957 --> 02:07.127
* Oh, come on... *

02:07.228 --> 02:09.463
(laughing)

02:12.266 --> 02:14.268
* Oh! *

02:14.368 --> 02:16.270
* Come on *

02:16.370 --> 02:18.739
* Oh! Yeah *

02:19.873 --> 02:21.675
* Slippery when it's wet *

02:21.775 --> 02:24.445
* Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo *

02:24.545 --> 02:26.647
* Slippery when it's wet *

02:26.747 --> 02:29.417
* Slippery, slippery *

02:29.517 --> 02:31.285
* Slippery when it's wet. *

02:31.385 --> 02:33.621
* *

02:38.726 --> 02:41.061
(overlapping chatter, laughter)

02:41.161 --> 02:43.464
CARTMAN:
Yeah, and so,
and so then, so then

02:43.564 --> 02:44.998
Clyde said that if a chick
uses hairspray,

02:45.098 --> 02:46.934
you can actually
light her head on fire.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.469
Nuh-uh.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.738
Yeah-huh, Tolkien.
You guys want to see?

02:50.838 --> 02:52.306
Kenny, do you have matches?

02:52.406 --> 02:54.675
Yeah, of course I have matches.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.577
Check this out, you guys.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.516
-BUS DRIVER: Eric Cartman.
-(bus brakes)

03:02.616 --> 03:04.352
Eric Cartman.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.554
What? You're ruining it.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.223
This is your stop.

03:09.323 --> 03:12.960
Oh. Right.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.962
Scuse-scuse me.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.102
Hey. Hey, guys.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.473
You want to come hang out
at my house for a bit?

03:26.307 --> 03:28.476
Uh, no, that's cool.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.878
It's not my fault
that my mom lost her job

03:30.978 --> 03:33.414
and we had to move, you guys.
It's really not so bad.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.049
Uh, yeah, maybe some other time.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.685
CARTMAN:
My house is cool, you guys.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.388
-Kenny, you want to come chill?
-I'm cool, dude.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.591
It's still way better
than your house, Kenny!

03:43.691 --> 03:45.893
'Cause your family's poor!

03:46.827 --> 03:49.830
Your family's poor, Kenny.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.304
Hi, honey. How was school?

03:56.404 --> 03:59.072
Fuck you, Mom.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.485
You doing anything, Tolkien?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.454
You want to come over
to my house, play a board game?

04:13.554 --> 04:16.023
Oh, um,
I should probably go home.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.792
Well, okay, you want to play
a game over at your house?

04:18.892 --> 04:20.894
Yeah, uh, I-I don't know.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.631
Sorry, I'm just...
not in the best mood, I guess.

04:23.731 --> 04:27.301
Hey, are you still worried
about Karen?

04:27.401 --> 04:28.569
Yeah.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.103
Yeah, me, too.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.739
But we all have to try
to just be happy, you know?

04:31.839 --> 04:33.541
No matter what happens
with Karen.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.809
You're right. Okay, come on.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.346
RANDY:
Hey.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.315
Stan, where do you think
you're going?

04:41.415 --> 04:43.484
I'm gonna go hang out
at Tolkien's house

04:43.584 --> 04:44.585
for a bit, Karen.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.219
No, you're not.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.221
Yes, I am, Karen.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.557
You better knock that off.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.525
I don't want you
playing with Tolkien.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.160
Karen, just come back inside.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.396
I've told you
I don't want our son

04:55.496 --> 04:56.864
hanging out with those people.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.633
And exactly what do you mean
by "those people"?

04:59.733 --> 05:01.201
I mean traitors

05:01.301 --> 05:04.572
who I hired to give my weed
more street cred,

05:04.672 --> 05:07.307
and then go out and open
their own weed business.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.309
You're not the only weed grower
in this valley.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.845
But I was supposed to be
the only Black one.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.648
WATER COMMISSIONER:
Excuse me.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.318
You the owners of these farms?

05:18.419 --> 05:20.320
I own Tegridy Weed,

05:20.421 --> 05:22.790
the original marijuana farm
on this street.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.858
Okay, and your name is...

05:24.958 --> 05:27.127
His name is Karen Marsh.

05:27.227 --> 05:30.931
You better get that fucking name
out your fucking mouth.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.668
Well, gentlemen,
I'm the Water Commissioner.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.905
Colorado Division
of Water Resources.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.441
I'm here to find out
exactly what's going on

05:40.541 --> 05:43.343
with the city's water. Weed?

05:43.444 --> 05:45.012
The city's water?

05:45.112 --> 05:47.648
Well, you see, the water here
is supposed to make its way

05:47.748 --> 05:50.684
to all the thirsty people
down in Denver.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.053
And, uh...

05:53.153 --> 05:56.356
Well, there's a lot
of thirsty people down there.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.426
I just want to see
how much you farmers

05:58.526 --> 05:59.793
are actually using.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.228
Okay, well, we can show you...

06:01.328 --> 06:03.230
Well, you should check
out his fucking farm.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.499
If you're, if you're gonna
check out anyone's water,

06:05.599 --> 06:06.700
it should be his.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.837
All right, maybe I'll do that.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.272
(car door opens, closes)

06:12.372 --> 06:14.408
(engine starts)

06:21.582 --> 06:24.518
CARTMAN:
* I live in a hot dog *

06:24.618 --> 06:27.721
* On a lonely old hill *

06:27.821 --> 06:30.558
* People make fun of me *

06:30.658 --> 06:33.761
* And that's not cool *

06:33.861 --> 06:36.997
* I'm isolated from my friends *

06:37.097 --> 06:39.467
* Against my will *

06:40.233 --> 06:42.736
* My possessions
are now condiments *

06:42.836 --> 06:45.172
* And that is not cool *

06:45.272 --> 06:48.241
* And I don't want
to live like this *

06:48.341 --> 06:51.745
* You don't know how I feel *

06:51.845 --> 06:53.981
* I've got no room to grow *

06:54.081 --> 06:57.651
* And it is just so not cool *

06:57.751 --> 07:01.154
* Just once in my life,
I'd like cool stuff to happen *

07:01.254 --> 07:04.792
* Everything keeps changing,
and I'm not adapting *

07:04.892 --> 07:08.195
* I'm crying like a girl,
and it's super not cool *

07:08.295 --> 07:12.199
* And I just want
something cool to happen *

07:12.299 --> 07:14.735
* To me *

07:14.835 --> 07:16.870
* I've lived through such pain *

07:16.970 --> 07:18.639
* The word's been so cruel *

07:18.739 --> 07:21.675
* Something's got to happen,
something that's cool *

07:21.775 --> 07:26.580
* I just want something cool
to happen... *

07:26.680 --> 07:28.381
This is it, right here.

07:32.620 --> 07:36.023
* To me. *

07:36.123 --> 07:38.391
REALTOR:
Okay, right this way,
Mr. Cussler.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.628
You are going to love
this property.

07:40.728 --> 07:44.932
It's over 30 acres, and it's
in a real up-and-coming area.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.868
I think you could build
an amazing home here.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.371
Yes. Yes, I believe I could.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.907
REALTOR:
Now, it's about an hour commute
from where you are in Denver,

07:54.007 --> 07:56.343
but I think the potential here
is fabulous.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.113
TALNUA CUSSLER:
Oh, yes.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.083
It looks absolutely ideal.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.618
Do you like to entertain?

08:04.718 --> 08:06.286
Because you could easily build
a ten-bedroom house

08:06.386 --> 08:08.522
on this property.
You could have a dedicated gym,

08:08.622 --> 08:10.057
even a full-size movie theater.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.192
Full-size movie theater?

08:12.292 --> 08:13.927
If you want, we can walk
around the property.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.896
-It's a bit muddy, but we can...
-That won't be necessary.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.299
I'll take it.
Full asking price. Cash.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.801
Oh-oh-oh.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.203
Da Da.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.875
-(knock on door)
-Yes. Come in.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.911
Mom said you wanted to see me.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.913
Yes, Shelley, have a seat.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.816
Close the door, please.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.217
(Randy clears throat)

08:37.317 --> 08:40.588
I've been, uh, wanting
to talk to you, Shelley.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.122
Um...

08:42.222 --> 08:45.926
Can you tell me why everyone
is calling me "Karen"?

08:47.494 --> 08:48.929
Don't worry about it.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.464
Well, everybody
keeps calling me Karen,

08:51.565 --> 08:53.066
and I don't get it.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.235
Is it, is it, like,
a joke or something?

08:55.335 --> 08:58.939
"Karen" is a pejorative term
for a white person

08:59.039 --> 09:01.575
who acts overly entitled
and demanding.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.945
Okay, well, that's fucked up.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.514
Don't you think that's
a little, like, sexist?

09:07.615 --> 09:08.949
I didn't start it.

09:09.049 --> 09:09.983
Well, who did?

09:10.083 --> 09:11.184
The Internet.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.654
So-so now somebody is a Karen

09:13.754 --> 09:16.456
just 'cause they want
to be treated with some respect?

09:16.556 --> 09:19.693
I deserve to not have people
walk all over me, okay?

09:19.793 --> 09:23.030
I have the right to call
the cops when things happen.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.932
That's fine, Karen.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.334
Shelley, I deserve to not have--

09:27.434 --> 09:29.502
What the fuck is he doing here?

09:29.603 --> 09:31.939
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.576
Excuse me, this is my property.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.312
Your soil seems very hydrated.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.014
Must be getting lots of water.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.316
What are you saying,
that I use too much?

09:43.416 --> 09:47.154
I use the water that my crops
need and nothing more.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.857
Is that a Slip 'N Slide
over there?

09:52.059 --> 09:55.262
That is an agricultural
Slip 'N Slide, yes.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.798
Apparently, you know nothing
about farming.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.167
Look, if you have
any excess of water,

10:00.267 --> 10:03.136
you might actually make some
money, that's all I'm saying.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.172
Make money? Wait, what?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.507
You heard of water transfers?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.010
See, you have a lease
to use some of the water

10:10.110 --> 10:12.279
from your stream here,
but what you don't use,

10:12.379 --> 10:14.481
you could actually sell
the rights to.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.717
I already talked
to your neighbor about it.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.185
Yeah, well, see, the thing is,

10:18.285 --> 10:20.120
this farm is about Tegridy,

10:20.220 --> 10:21.855
not stupid water rights.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.257
And if you want to keep
coming here and bugging me,

10:24.357 --> 10:26.226
then I would like to speak
to your manager

10:26.326 --> 10:27.961
because you are harassing me,

10:28.061 --> 10:30.297
and I am important.

10:30.397 --> 10:34.301
Well, have a nice day, Karen.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.269
It's Randy!

10:36.369 --> 10:39.673
I know what Karen means.
I'm not stupid.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.944
(video game guns blasting)

10:44.044 --> 10:46.146
What the water commissioner
said is true.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.215
We have water rights
to use 10,000 gallons

10:48.315 --> 10:49.750
a month off our stream.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.652
If we could cut back our
agricultural water use by 50%

10:52.753 --> 10:54.955
and show that our excess water
is making it down

10:55.055 --> 10:56.523
to the Denver Reservoir,

10:56.623 --> 10:58.125
then we'd have
the right to sell it.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.626
You really think so?

10:59.727 --> 11:01.194
I was a financial consultant

11:01.294 --> 11:03.330
before I was a weed farmer--
there's potential here.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.265
But how do we
even prove the water

11:05.365 --> 11:07.200
from our farms makes it
all the way to Denver?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.902
-Raingutter regatta.
-What?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.304
We made those little boats
in online COVID camp, remember?

11:11.404 --> 11:14.007
Oh, yeah. I bet we could
float that down our stream.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.411
We demonstrate
where the water goes,

11:18.511 --> 11:19.813
and meanwhile,

11:19.913 --> 11:22.082
we start selling off
pieces of our water rights

11:22.182 --> 11:25.185
to subscribers that want it.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.788
Boys, can you
build me a test boat?

11:27.888 --> 11:30.057
Sure.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.726
We're about to start
our very own...

11:32.826 --> 11:33.894
streaming service.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.428
* Whores in this house *

11:35.528 --> 11:37.564
* There's some whores
in this house *

11:37.664 --> 11:39.900
* There's some whores in this
house, there's some whores *

11:40.000 --> 11:42.502
-* In this house *
-* I said certified freak *

11:42.602 --> 11:45.272
* Seven days a week *

11:45.372 --> 11:47.640
* Wet-ass pussy,
make that pullout game weak *

11:47.741 --> 11:49.609
-* Woo, yeah *
-* Ah *

11:49.709 --> 11:51.711
* Yeah, yeah *

11:51.812 --> 11:54.147
* Yeah, yeah,
you fucking with some *

11:54.247 --> 11:56.016
* Wet-ass pussy,
bring a bucket *

11:56.116 --> 11:58.618
* And a mop
for this wet-ass pussy... *

11:58.718 --> 12:00.754
TOLKIEN'S DAD:
The Credigree Weed
streaming service.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.122
We are currently in beta testing

12:02.222 --> 12:04.057
to see if our stream
makes it to Denver,

12:04.157 --> 12:05.358
but if it does, we are seeing

12:05.458 --> 12:08.061
if there are any
interested subscribers.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.899
-(overlapping shouting)
-* Give me everything you got
for this *

12:11.999 --> 12:14.902
* Wet-ass pussy, beat it up,
baby, catch a charge *

12:15.002 --> 12:17.871
* Extra large and extra hard,
put this pussy... *

12:17.971 --> 12:19.406
Come on.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.108
* Swipe your nose
like a credit card *

12:21.208 --> 12:23.143
* Hop on top, I want to ride,
I do a kegel *

12:23.243 --> 12:25.345
* While it's inside, spit
in my mouth, look in my eyes *

12:25.445 --> 12:27.614
* This pussy is wet,
come take a dive *

12:27.714 --> 12:29.416
* Tie me up like I'm surprised *

12:29.516 --> 12:31.084
* Let's roleplay,
I'll wear a disguise *

12:31.184 --> 12:33.453
* I want you to park
that big Mack truck *

12:33.553 --> 12:35.022
* Right in this little garage *

12:35.122 --> 12:36.990
* Make it cream,
make me scream *

12:37.090 --> 12:39.592
* Out in public, make a scene,
I don't cook, I don't clean *

12:39.692 --> 12:41.895
-* But let me tell you
how I got this ring *
-* Ayy, ayy *

12:41.995 --> 12:44.097
* Gobble me, swallow me,
drip down the side of me *

12:44.197 --> 12:46.133
* Quick, jump out 'fore you let
it get inside of me, I tell *

12:46.233 --> 12:48.268
* Him where to put it, never
tell him where I'm 'bout to be *

12:48.368 --> 12:50.170
* I'll run down on him 'fore
I have a-- ayy-- runnin' me *

12:50.270 --> 12:51.839
* Talk your shit,
bite your lip *

12:51.939 --> 12:53.907
* Ask for a car
while you ride that dick *

12:54.007 --> 12:55.775
* You really ain't never got to
fuck him for a thang *

12:55.876 --> 12:57.477
* He already made his mind up
'fore he came *

12:57.577 --> 12:58.879
* Now get your boots
and your coat *

12:58.979 --> 13:00.513
* For this wet-ass pussy *

13:00.613 --> 13:01.849
* He bought a phone
just for pictures *

13:01.949 --> 13:03.216
* Of this wet-ass pussy *

13:03.316 --> 13:05.085
* Paid my tuition just to *

13:05.185 --> 13:06.786
* Kiss me on this
wet-ass pussy *

13:06.887 --> 13:09.622
* Now make it rain
if you want to see some *

13:09.722 --> 13:12.926
-* Wet-ass pussy *
-* Now from the top,
make it drop *

13:13.026 --> 13:15.562
* That's some wet-ass pussy,
now get a bucket *

13:15.662 --> 13:17.931
* And a mop,
that's some wet-ass pussy *

13:18.031 --> 13:20.467
* I'm talkin' WAP, WAP, WAP,
that's some *

13:20.567 --> 13:22.102
* Wet-ass pussy *

13:22.202 --> 13:23.603
* Macaroni in a pot *

13:23.703 --> 13:25.105
* That's some wet-ass pussy *

13:25.205 --> 13:26.206
* Huh *

13:26.306 --> 13:28.141
* Whores in this house *

13:28.241 --> 13:30.177
* There's some whores in this
house, there's some whores *

13:30.277 --> 13:32.846
* In this house, there's some
whores in this house *

13:32.946 --> 13:35.282
* There's some whores
in this house, there's some... *

13:35.382 --> 13:37.384
-Yeah! We did it! Yeah!
-We totally did it, dude.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.387
As you can see, the water
from Credigree Farms flows

13:40.487 --> 13:42.255
directly into
Denver's water supply.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.192
Well, in that case,
I suppose all your subscribers

13:45.292 --> 13:46.994
get to have more water
from the reservoir.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.495
Ah. Oh.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.830
You all make-a Pi Pi so happy.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.300
Now, my water park
can have a-plenty a-water

13:53.400 --> 13:55.068
to mix with all-a the pee.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.236
Of course,

13:56.336 --> 13:57.504
you will have to prove

13:57.604 --> 13:59.239
that the flow of water
is constant.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.074
We'll need a little boat
to come through

14:01.174 --> 14:02.775
to the reservoir every day.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.477
Every day?

14:04.577 --> 14:08.115
Boys, I'm gonna need you to make
a lot more boats for my stream.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.984
How do you feel about...
20 bucks a boat?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.186
20 bucks a boat? Hell yeah.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.488
We're gonna be rich, dude.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.126
Mom. Mom, I need to talk to you.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.527
Come on, sit down.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.629
Eric, if you're going
to yell at me again

14:22.729 --> 14:24.697
about our home, I really
don't have the strength.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.099
No, Mom.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.701
I'm never gonna need
to yell at you ever again.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.303
We're gonna
get out of here, Mom.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.339
What are you talking about?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.574
I've figured our way
out of this hot dog.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.309
I don't know if you've seen,
but there's a rich guy

14:36.409 --> 14:38.011
building a big house
across the street.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.913
We can live in that house, Mom.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.314
We can have him take care of us.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.283
Eric, how would we do that?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.653
Because we are gonna get you...

14:46.753 --> 14:48.655
fake tits.

14:48.755 --> 14:49.522
What?

14:49.622 --> 14:50.890
Breast implants, Mom.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.325
That's what rich guys like.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.593
You remember
what Matt Damon said?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.495
Fortune favors the brave, Mom.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.464
When rich guys come up here
and get one look at you with

14:57.564 --> 14:59.166
your big, sweet tits, they're
gonna give us everything...

14:59.266 --> 15:00.867
Eric, that's enough, okay?

15:00.968 --> 15:03.303
What do you mean it's enough?
I've-I've figured it all out.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.172
Rich guys want a woman
with nice titties, Mom.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.573
-It's very...
-Okay.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.841
Eric, I'm not comfortable
talking about this.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.611
Well, I'm not comfortable
living in a fucking hot dog.

15:11.711 --> 15:15.182
We live here because I gave in
to you and quit my job.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.050
What do you want from me, Eric?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.152
I want you

15:19.252 --> 15:22.355
to get breast implants, Mom.
(sniffles)

15:22.455 --> 15:24.724
So-so that rich guys like you,

15:24.824 --> 15:28.195
and we can go live
in a sweet house.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.729
Please, Mom,

15:29.829 --> 15:33.133
I just want you
to get fake tits.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.069
Eric, even if I wanted to,

15:36.169 --> 15:38.305
the fact is, we can't afford it.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.873
A surgery like that
is very expensive.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.109
Like, how expensive?

15:42.209 --> 15:44.211
At least $10,000.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.247
$10,000?

15:47.347 --> 15:48.881
Yes, Eric.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.618
We can't afford it?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.922
We can't afford it.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.463
Chief.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.698
-Chief, there's a big problem.
-What is it?

16:05.798 --> 16:09.002
We've got a code red
emergency call on 911.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.370
It's Karen.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.173
Oh, not Karen again.
Jesus Christ.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.574
(phone beeps)

16:14.674 --> 16:16.576
Yes, Karen,
how can we help you this time?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.845
Okay, first of all,
I know what it means

16:18.945 --> 16:21.314
when you call me Karen,
so you can just knock it off.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.850
Secondly, secondly,
my neighbor's kid

16:23.950 --> 16:25.285
is over here at my house.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.520
There's a kid trespassing
at your house?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.589
No, my son invited him over

16:29.689 --> 16:32.359
for lunch, and my wife is making
him hot dogs and tater tots,

16:32.459 --> 16:34.327
even though I said
I don't want him here.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.429
Well, then what harm
is he doing, Karen?

16:36.529 --> 16:38.465
His family farm is shady.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.667
Did you know that they're
doing a streaming service?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.335
I demand that you investigate.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.138
How did they manage
to even show that their water

16:45.238 --> 16:46.339
goes through to Denver?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.441
Hello? Are you listening to me?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.510
I want to talk to your manager.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.546
I've already told you, Karen,
I don't have a manager.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.884
Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.152
Can you believe that?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.454
The cops aren't even
gonna do anything.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.090
Oh, well, at least
you tried, Karen.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.058
-(chair scrapes floor)
-It just doesn't make sense.

17:05.158 --> 17:08.061
How is that traitor
able to prove his water

17:08.161 --> 17:09.762
makes it down to Denver?

17:09.862 --> 17:10.897
Well, um...

17:10.997 --> 17:12.632
maybe he got some
creative people

17:12.732 --> 17:14.667
to put something on his stream.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.770
Yeah, I'll bet you he did.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.140
He's got to be paying
some expert or something.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.975
Oh, if I could find that guy,
I'd pay him double.

17:23.910 --> 17:27.347
Well, you know, at camp,
they had us build these...

17:27.447 --> 17:28.715
little boats, that, uh...

17:28.815 --> 17:30.550
They're kind of tough
to make, but...

17:30.650 --> 17:34.454
I think that we could
make you something.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.757
And then we could float
the boats downstream

17:37.857 --> 17:39.826
from the farm
with little Tegridy sails

17:39.926 --> 17:42.929
on them to show people
where the water's coming from.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.964
Could you guys build me
a test boat right away?

17:45.064 --> 17:48.101
Oh, uh, yeah, we could probably
build you something, yeah.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.037
I can't wait to see the look
on that traitor's face

17:51.138 --> 17:54.874
when he sees that we're
in the streaming business, too.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.579
Last night, I had a dream
that Ariana Grande

17:59.679 --> 18:01.080
was trying to fuck
her own ass with a gun,

18:01.181 --> 18:03.683
but then she farted,
and blood shot out her dick.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.886
(laughs) Ariana Grande?
That's hilarious.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.126
STAN:
Kyle.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.761
Kenny. You guys, get over here.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.429
Sit down, you guys.
We need to talk.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.299
What's going on, dude?

18:19.399 --> 18:21.468
Check this out.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.769
Where'd you get that?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.604
Making stuff
for streaming services.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.072
Holy shit. Really?

18:26.173 --> 18:27.674
We made these
for my family's farm.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.676
Then we took another deal
to make them for Stan's.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.578
So then we went out
and offered boats to, like,

18:31.678 --> 18:32.979
three other farms,
and now they want stuff

18:33.079 --> 18:34.314
for their streams, too.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.249
-So, you guys want to help us?
-I don't get it.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.817
You don't have to.
We don't, either.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.319
You just have to make boats.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.753
But we want to keep it
on the low

18:40.853 --> 18:42.455
because we don't want
other kids copying us.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.856
Are you guys
gonna have Cartman help?

18:43.956 --> 18:45.525
No. He'll fuck it
all up somehow.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.993
Okay, I'm in.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.470
(sighs) Fuck.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.480
Faster. Work faster.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.316
We need to be up and running.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.184
WATER COMMISSIONER:
Excuse me.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.486
Mr. Cussler, is it?

19:13.586 --> 19:15.322
Who are you?

19:15.422 --> 19:18.691
I'm the water commissioner.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.728
I just, uh, wanted to see
what you're up to up here.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.796
I'm not up to anything. Why?

19:23.896 --> 19:26.333
Well, you know, there's a lot
of streaming services

19:26.433 --> 19:29.068
starting up
in this town, and, uh...

19:29.168 --> 19:32.272
word on the street is you might
be trying to outdo them all.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.375
They're all just
small time creeks.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.777
When it comes
to the Streaming Wars,

19:37.877 --> 19:41.013
I intend to be
the Amazon... River.

19:41.113 --> 19:44.384
Yeah, well, you see,
there's regulations,

19:44.484 --> 19:45.885
Mr. Cussler.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.455
There's state rules
when it comes to streaming.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.523
And, uh, well,

19:50.623 --> 19:54.294
if you don't follow them,
bad things can happen.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.630
Is that right? Boys?

20:00.166 --> 20:03.169
I'm not some pissant
little farmer, Commissioner.

20:03.270 --> 20:07.540
You want to threaten me,
I'll threaten you right back.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.842
I didn't mean
to threaten you, sir.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.344
In fact,

20:11.444 --> 20:13.746
I think I can help you.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.783
(school bell rings)

20:28.995 --> 20:30.330
We've only got
20 minutes left, you guys.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.564
We've got to work faster.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.132
I'm waiting on more
popsicle sticks.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.034
Come on, Butters, you have to
speed up your station.

20:35.134 --> 20:38.738
I'm sucking down popsicles
as fast as I can, fellas.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.743
There you guys are.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.748
How come you're in
the home ec room during recess?

20:48.848 --> 20:50.683
Are those popsicle stick boats?

20:51.918 --> 20:55.087
Oh, yeah. We're just making
some popsicle boats.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.557
We're gonna, you know, like,
race them, you know.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.360
You're gonna race
all those popsicle boats?

21:00.460 --> 21:02.762
Yeah, just, you know,

21:02.862 --> 21:04.564
race them, see which one wins.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.333
Right-right, fellas?

21:06.433 --> 21:09.969
Oh. That sounds
like a fun activity. Um...

21:10.069 --> 21:11.838
I was just gonna ask you guys,

21:11.938 --> 21:14.541
do you know any way
to, like, raise money?

21:16.476 --> 21:17.777
What do you mean?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.178
We have no idea
what you're talking about.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.013
Okay, I just...

21:21.113 --> 21:23.683
I need to try and raise
some money because...

21:23.783 --> 21:25.452
my mom needs to have a surgery,

21:25.552 --> 21:28.588
and we can't afford it.

21:30.189 --> 21:32.825
Oh. Dude...

21:32.925 --> 21:34.961
How much does your mom
need for her surgery?

21:35.061 --> 21:38.264
About $10,000.
I'm sorry, you guys.

21:38.365 --> 21:41.468
Just go back to your boat races.
I'll talk to you later.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.603
Cartman, wait.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.374
You actually can help us.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.375
Yeah.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.676
What do you mean?

21:49.776 --> 21:51.678
Look, dude, we're
actually making money

21:51.778 --> 21:52.779
for a streaming service.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.347
-Really?
-TOLKIEN: Yeah, come on.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.315
You can help us, and we'll
cut you in on the profits.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.385
Oh, my God, what-what
streaming service is it?

21:58.485 --> 21:59.819
It's a bunch of different ones.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.021
Here, help me
cut out these masts.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.123
Okay, yeah, sure.

22:04.223 --> 22:06.626
And, Cartman, I'm sorry.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.695
Thanks, Kyle.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.231
* *

22:23.643 --> 22:25.111
It's a green boat.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.679
(crowd cheering)

22:26.779 --> 22:27.947
Anyone on the green boat

22:28.047 --> 22:29.649
streaming service
can have their allotment

22:29.749 --> 22:31.418
of water for the day.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.252
Oh, here comes the white boat.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.654
(crowd cheering)

22:34.754 --> 22:35.922
Subscribers to

22:36.022 --> 22:37.557
Kush Country Farms
Streaming service

22:37.657 --> 22:38.558
have their allotments.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.126
Escusi. Escusi.

22:40.226 --> 22:43.463
Pi Pi's been a-waiting
all day for his water ticket.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.498
My water park need water.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.033
You'll just have to be patient.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.968
There's a lot of different
streaming services now.

22:49.068 --> 22:52.004
Yes, there's a-too many
streaming services.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.273
There's a streaming service
for this-a,

22:54.373 --> 22:56.476
and streaming service
for that-a.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.412
Pi Pi can't find his stuff-a.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.913
Why can't-a Pi Pi just have

23:01.013 --> 23:03.850
a one streaming service
have-a everything?

23:03.950 --> 23:06.052
Pi Pi got a streaming service
he like-a,

23:06.152 --> 23:08.220
and then-a
Pi Pi's stuff not on it.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.523
Pi Pi so confuse-a.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.359
(scanner beeping)

23:15.227 --> 23:16.929
Yeah, yeah, we're getting
more supplies now.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.364
You guys just
keep building boats.

23:18.465 --> 23:19.866
We'll be there fast as we can.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.934
Dude, I'm starting to think
we took on too much.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.003
-It's okay.
-It's not okay.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.005
We haven't even finished
Karen's boats yet.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.740
I do not want to piss Karen off.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.842
Tolkien, I've told you,
don't worry about Karen.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.878
Everything's gonna be fine.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.921
Hello, boys. That's quite
a haul you have there.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.492
My name is Mr. Cussler.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.560
I bought some property up here.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.361
I've been asking around,
and, uh...

23:49.462 --> 23:52.298
I believe you're the ones
responsible...

23:52.398 --> 23:53.733
for these?

23:53.833 --> 23:56.703
-Maybe.
-Fantastic little boats.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.270
I'm a big fan of your work.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.807
I have a nice stream
going through my property,

24:00.907 --> 24:03.175
and I'd like you
to make something for me.

24:03.275 --> 24:06.913
-Oh, we're-we're pretty, uh...
-We're pretty loaded up, man.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.447
Oh, I'm sure you are.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.851
That's why I'd like to make you
an exclusive deal.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.386
I want 10,000
of your little boats,

24:14.487 --> 24:17.524
and I'll pay you $15,000.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.659
BOTH:
$15,000?

24:19.759 --> 24:23.429
But I'm gonna need them
right away. Say three days?

24:23.530 --> 24:25.832
I have... big plans.

24:25.932 --> 24:28.200
Dude, we can't make 10,000 boats
in three days.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.902
We'll do it.

24:37.777 --> 24:40.613
Cartman, come on,
that looks like shit.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.048
Come on what, Kyle?

24:42.148 --> 24:43.415
Look, I-I know we're making
a lot of these,

24:43.516 --> 24:46.118
but we still have to
make them look nice.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.220
-Does it really matter?
-Yes, it matters.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.222
The streaming services
are paying for nice boats.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.991
BUTTERS:
(laughs) They don't
give a fuck, Kyle.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.260
They're gonna take
everything they can get.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.995
Everyone knows,
at the end of the day,

24:56.095 --> 24:58.565
there's only gonna be, like,
three streaming services,

24:58.665 --> 25:00.567
so they, like, everyone
just wants to have their shit

25:00.667 --> 25:03.035
on their stream
and get bought out, you know?

25:03.135 --> 25:05.471
And they don't give a fuck
how good anything is.

25:05.572 --> 25:08.207
And the people who made all the
deals, they don't give a fuck

25:08.307 --> 25:10.810
'cause they're all gonna get
fired anyway, you know?

25:10.910 --> 25:12.344
And everyone working
at this streaming service

25:12.444 --> 25:14.346
is now working over
at that streaming service.

25:14.446 --> 25:17.249
No one gives a shit about
what fucking goes on in it.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.351
Butters, I-I think you've had
too many popsicles.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.821
Yeah, I think maybe I've had
one too many popsicles.

25:21.921 --> 25:22.889
(door opens)

25:22.989 --> 25:25.491
You guys, you guys, we did it.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.793
KENNY:
What'd we do?

25:26.893 --> 25:29.996
We just got an offer
for 10,000 boats.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.931
It's $15,000, you guys.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.833
That's almost $3,000 each.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.335
-We're millionaires!
-Whoo-hoo!

25:36.435 --> 25:39.906
Hey, hey, aren't you guys
forgetting something?

25:40.006 --> 25:42.274
Cartman's mom's surgery?

25:42.374 --> 25:43.910
Oh, right.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.012
Well, what do you say, guys?

25:46.112 --> 25:47.780
With this money,
before we do anything,

25:47.880 --> 25:49.215
we pay for Cartman's
mom's surgery.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.183
You definitely have
my share, Eric.

25:51.283 --> 25:51.984
Mine, too.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.453
I really...

25:54.553 --> 25:57.189
really... don't fucking
deserve you guys.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.025
Come on, let's get to work.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.604
(water pipes creaking)

26:14.741 --> 26:17.443
NEWS REPORTER (over TV):
Just how bad could
the water situation get

26:17.543 --> 26:19.912
for Park County farmers
this summer?

26:20.012 --> 26:21.714
A new study says
this year's snowpack

26:21.814 --> 26:24.617
has almost completely
melted, and, once again,

26:24.717 --> 26:26.285
ManBearPig is to blame.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.721
That's right, Tom.
It appears ManBearPig

26:28.821 --> 26:32.759
has done a lot more damage this
year than originally predicted.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.560
As the spring thaws continue,

26:34.661 --> 26:36.328
we simply aren't seeing
that much water

26:36.428 --> 26:39.065
from way up
on the mountain peaks.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.233
If ManBearPig
is truly out there,

26:41.333 --> 26:43.435
then farmers might want
to start looking

26:43.535 --> 26:46.405
at the state
of that snowpack, Tom.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.323
* *

27:26.846 --> 27:29.081
* *

27:52.705 --> 27:54.774
Over here.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.109
Here!

27:57.209 --> 28:00.112
What is all this? What happened?

28:00.212 --> 28:02.749
The housing market up here...

28:02.849 --> 28:04.150
it went crazy.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.118
We've just been
selling properties

28:06.218 --> 28:08.120
without sleeping or eating.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.589
This property here
was the last to get an offer.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.524
The seller countered,
but we haven't heard back,

28:12.624 --> 28:14.126
and it's really
a buyer's market.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.361
Who's buying it all?

28:15.461 --> 28:17.930
Some rich guy from the city.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.531
(coughs)

28:19.631 --> 28:21.533
But we are currently
taking backup offers,

28:21.633 --> 28:23.535
if you'd like.
Do you have a broker?

28:23.635 --> 28:26.172
We are really the best in town.
My coworker Janice

28:26.272 --> 28:29.241
sold over 100 listings
in 72 hours.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.178
Look at this.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.646
They were right
about ManBearPig.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.916
There's not nearly
as much snow as last year.

28:37.016 --> 28:40.086
Yeah. There's a lot
you can do with this property.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.988
It has explosive views

28:42.088 --> 28:44.290
and a southern exposure
for those chilly winter nights.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.258
You can't sell
all the land up here.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.994
Can't you see
they just want the water?

28:48.094 --> 28:51.663
That's probably why they asked
for the inspection contingency.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.532
We countered
with an extra 20 days

28:53.632 --> 28:56.268
until close of escrow.
(chuckles) We got them.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.104
There's no snow up here.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.906
There won't be enough water
for South Park.

29:00.006 --> 29:02.341
You...

29:02.441 --> 29:04.343
You could have
a walkout basement here

29:04.443 --> 29:06.445
with room
for an outdoor kitchen.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.183
Think of
the entertaining potential.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.452
Do you like to entertain?

29:24.463 --> 29:26.498
(yawns)

29:29.235 --> 29:31.470
(chickens clucking)

29:43.315 --> 29:45.551
(water rushing)

30:02.768 --> 30:05.304
"Cussler Industries"?

30:07.573 --> 30:09.775
Huh? Huh?

30:09.876 --> 30:12.111
Oh!

30:36.235 --> 30:38.470
* *

30:43.976 --> 30:46.512
My streaming service!

30:51.483 --> 30:53.785
* Happy surprise time *

30:53.886 --> 30:55.487
* To you *

30:55.587 --> 30:58.824
* Something's happened
that's cool... *

30:58.925 --> 31:00.426
What is this, Eric?

31:00.526 --> 31:03.529
* Just sit down right here *

31:03.629 --> 31:06.999
* Your son has done
something cool. *

31:07.099 --> 31:08.267
Are you ready, Mom?

31:08.367 --> 31:10.903
(giggles) Yes.
What is it, sweetie?

31:13.805 --> 31:16.408
-Wait a minute, Eric,
what is this?
-(door opens)

31:16.508 --> 31:19.845
Okay, hello, Mrs. Cartman.
I'm Dr. Stevens.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.814
I understand you're interested
in breast augmentation?

31:22.915 --> 31:24.250
That's right, she is.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.452
Well, there are a few options.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.620
We prefer
the saline implants now.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.389
They-they can be put
either under

31:30.489 --> 31:32.124
the chest muscle or on top.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.994
Did you have any idea what size
breasts you wanted to achieve?

31:35.094 --> 31:36.628
The largest size.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.431
Eric, I've told you
a hundred times,

31:39.531 --> 31:41.567
I'm not getting a boob job.

31:41.667 --> 31:45.404
Uh, I'm a bit confused here,
Mrs. Cartman.

31:45.504 --> 31:48.474
Your procedure has already been
completely paid for.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.210
-What?
-Surprise!

31:51.310 --> 31:53.479
I raised all the money, Mom.
It's done.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.349
No, Eric. I said
I don't want breast implants.

31:57.449 --> 31:58.850
You said we couldn't afford it.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.452
I went out,
and I worked every day,

32:00.552 --> 32:02.388
and I got you the money
for new tits, Mom.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.957
I'm fine with my body
the way it is.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.826
You are, but rich guys aren't.
Am I right, Doctor?

32:07.926 --> 32:09.895
Okay, uh, Mrs. Cartman,

32:09.996 --> 32:12.531
if you'd like to just go back
up to the front office,

32:12.631 --> 32:14.266
they can refund all the money.

32:14.366 --> 32:18.037
No! No, Doctor, please,
I live in a hot dog!

32:18.137 --> 32:20.306
Because he made me quit my job,

32:20.406 --> 32:21.773
and I promised myself

32:21.873 --> 32:24.343
I wouldn't give in
to him ever again.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.513
Get fake tits or else
I'll call the police, Mom.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.082
Do what you want, Eric.
I am done with this.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.483
Fine, then I'll run away.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.419
You'll just have
to run away, then.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.720
I'll go live with Grandma.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.156
I'm sure Grandma
would love that.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.792
I've given in to you
too many times, Eric.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.594
It stops now.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.564
You're not gonna give in, huh?
We'll just see about that.

32:45.664 --> 32:49.301
Doctor, keep those tits on ice.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.971
(door opens)

32:53.072 --> 32:54.606
(door closes)

33:01.480 --> 33:02.914
What is that?

33:03.015 --> 33:06.585
It's... it's a little boat.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.155
Stan, are you making stuff

33:09.255 --> 33:11.423
for other streaming services?

33:12.624 --> 33:15.127
Stanley? We had a deal.

33:15.227 --> 33:18.330
Are you making stuff for other
streaming services, yes or no?

33:18.430 --> 33:21.300
Yes. This guy paid us
a shitload of money.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.968
I paid you a shitload of money.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.803
Yeah, we make them
for whoever pays us.

33:24.903 --> 33:26.738
We make stuff
for Credigree, too.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.307
For Credigree?

33:28.407 --> 33:30.242
They're the enemy, Stan.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.710
You live here.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.046
You're exclusive
to Tegridy Weed.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.482
(scoffs) Everyone is fighting
and trying to get rich,

33:36.582 --> 33:38.184
and we're just in the middle
doing our thing.

33:38.284 --> 33:40.419
Doing your thing. Wow.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.121
You're a fucking dick.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.989
How much money's enough, Stan?

33:44.090 --> 33:45.291
Cock-sucking cunt.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.426
-What is going on?
-Oh, nothing.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.695
Your son and his friends
just made exclusive deals

33:49.795 --> 33:51.797
for multiple streaming services.

33:51.897 --> 33:52.931
Ugh.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.500
Oh, but I guess
that's just Karen

33:54.600 --> 33:56.268
being Karen again, huh?

33:56.368 --> 33:58.470
Yeah, screw whatever
Karen thinks.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.973
Maybe it's bad for business,
but fuck Karen.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.742
Okay, I'm sorry.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.478
We're going to march right over
to where this guy lives,

34:06.578 --> 34:08.480
and tell him that
you can't possibly take on

34:08.580 --> 34:10.582
another streaming service
without sacrificing

34:10.682 --> 34:13.819
-the quality of your product.
-Rats.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.093
(clears throat)

34:30.536 --> 34:33.472
Well, Mom, I guess
I'll be leaving now.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.574
Oh, really? Where are you going?

34:35.674 --> 34:37.309
I can't do this anymore, Mom.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.845
If you won't listen to me, then
I really don't have a choice.

34:39.945 --> 34:42.381
Well, I'm very sorry
to hear that, Eric.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.816
I hope you take
good care of yourself.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.986
Okay, well, I guess I'll just
ask you one more time

34:48.086 --> 34:49.821
if you would please
get fake tits. I know...

34:49.921 --> 34:52.558
I'm not getting
breast implants, Eric.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.160
Okay, that's fine.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.561
So, you're running away?

34:55.661 --> 34:57.329
Oh, I'm not running away, Mom.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.997
No, that would be
the easy way out.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.799
You remember when
I told you how easy

35:00.899 --> 35:02.601
breast enhancement would be,

35:02.701 --> 35:04.370
and you said, "If it's so easy,
why don't you do it?"

35:04.470 --> 35:06.172
Well, I'm taking
your advice, Mom.

35:06.272 --> 35:09.074
If you won't get fake breasts,
then I will.

35:09.175 --> 35:11.577
-What?
-I've already paid the clinic,

35:11.677 --> 35:13.379
and I'll just tell them that
the implants were for me.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.880
You know it's 2022, right?

35:14.980 --> 35:16.782
You know they do surgeries
like this to kids now?

35:16.882 --> 35:19.951
Guess I'll just go
and get fake tits, Mom.

35:20.051 --> 35:23.555
Well, Eric, I guess
that's just your choice.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.158
Mom, I'm serious. It's 2022.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.194
They do these kinds
of surgeries to kids now.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.628
Yes, I know.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.530
Okay, well, then
I'm gonna go to the doctor,

35:31.630 --> 35:32.998
and I'm gonna go get
breast implants.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.633
Okay.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.269
Okay, Mom,
I'm going out the door.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.471
Okay, sweetie, be safe.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.872
Gonna go get fake tits now.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.674
If that's what you want, Eric.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.610
It's not what I want, it's what
you're making me do, Mom.

35:44.710 --> 35:47.546
Okay, honey, well, I love you.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.718
-Okay, well, I'll see you.
-Bye, honey.

35:56.522 --> 35:57.923
Gonna go get breast implants.

35:58.023 --> 36:01.227
I'll come pick you up
when you're done.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.729
Cool.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.978
Come on.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.852
Yes?

36:26.952 --> 36:29.421
Hello, we'd like to speak
with Mr. Cussler, please.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.789
For what?

36:30.889 --> 36:33.124
Well, I want to let him know
that my son here

36:33.225 --> 36:36.395
made a streaming deal
that he had no business making.

36:36.495 --> 36:37.563
Didn't you, Stan?

36:37.663 --> 36:39.097
No, technically, no.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.399
Technically what?

36:40.499 --> 36:43.101
I'm afraid
Mr. Cussler can't see you.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.836
Oh, really? Okay, well,

36:44.936 --> 36:47.906
you go and tell him
that it's Karen Marsh, okay?

36:48.006 --> 36:50.041
And that I will talk
to him right now.

36:50.141 --> 36:53.078
He can't talk to you
because he's dead.

36:53.178 --> 36:54.680
What?

36:54.780 --> 36:57.416
Mr. Cussler's body was found
several hours ago.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.585
He was... attacked

36:59.685 --> 37:01.587
by ManBearPig.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.492
(indistinct radio chatter)

37:06.592 --> 37:07.893
Everyone keep this area clear.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.561
I need casts of the footprints.

37:09.661 --> 37:12.598
Keep your radios down. We don't
want the press showing up.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.165
What's going on here?

37:14.266 --> 37:15.667
Aw, shit, it's Karen.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.102
(officers grumbling)

37:17.202 --> 37:19.638
Hey, look, my son
was in business with this guy.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.707
You really think
he was killed by ManBearPig?

37:21.807 --> 37:23.141
Take a look for yourself.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.011
Something tore him apart
and shit in his face.

37:26.111 --> 37:27.879
Workers found him
late this morning.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.781
The footprints
are those of a pig,

37:29.881 --> 37:31.182
but the claw marks
are those of a bear,

37:31.283 --> 37:33.652
and the excrement,
clearly that of a man.

37:35.053 --> 37:37.589
Why would ManBearPig
single him out?

37:37.689 --> 37:38.957
Apparently, this Cussler guy

37:39.057 --> 37:40.959
was taking advantage
of the water supply.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.362
ManBearPig must've gotten
some kind of vengeance

37:43.462 --> 37:45.196
for the rich guy's greed.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.367
Oh, no.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.802
Karen? What is it?

37:52.070 --> 37:53.271
Karen?

37:53.372 --> 37:54.706
It's just that...

37:54.806 --> 37:57.709
if ManBearPig was getting
vengeance on Cussler,

37:57.809 --> 38:00.946
would he also want
to come after my son?

38:12.458 --> 38:13.492
(knock on door)

38:13.592 --> 38:15.961
Ah, yes. Come on-a in.

38:16.061 --> 38:18.129
It's a-open.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.667
Hello, Pi Pi.
Do you have a minute?

38:21.767 --> 38:24.870
Oh, my good friend
from-a Credigree Farm-a.

38:24.970 --> 38:28.173
So nice a-you to visit.
Mwah. Mwah.

38:28.273 --> 38:31.777
Look. Everything going good
for-a Pi Pi water park.

38:31.877 --> 38:34.413
Everyone having fun.

38:34.513 --> 38:37.616
Yes, that's what I came
to talk to you about.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.385
Pi Pi, I'm sorry, but...

38:39.485 --> 38:41.887
I'm going to have to cancel
my streaming service.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.322
What? Cancel-a Pi Pi?

38:44.423 --> 38:46.825
The drought is worse
than everyone thought.

38:46.925 --> 38:49.094
ManBearPig did a lot
of damage this year and...

38:49.194 --> 38:51.430
I don't have enough water
for my crops.

38:51.530 --> 38:54.199
Oh, that's too bad.

38:54.299 --> 38:57.736
It's too bad 'cause
now you fucked, a-huh?

38:57.836 --> 39:00.606
I need my water rights back,

39:00.706 --> 39:02.441
or else my farm won't survive.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.910
Oh, you make-a Pi Pi cry.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.845
What-a you expect-a, huh?

39:06.945 --> 39:09.080
It's a drought everywhere.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.717
Why you think I buy your water?

39:11.817 --> 39:14.853
You can-a suck Pi Pi dick, huh?

39:14.953 --> 39:16.321
Hey, you son of a bitch.

39:16.422 --> 39:18.156
You knew what you were doing
the whole time.

39:18.256 --> 39:19.958
You think I'm just gonna
sit here and take it?

39:20.058 --> 39:21.292
I'll call
the water commissioner.

39:21.393 --> 39:24.129
Oh, no. No, you-you don't
have to call him.

39:24.229 --> 39:25.831
He's right here.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.502
Afternoon, pal.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.304
How's the drought treating you?

39:33.405 --> 39:35.607
So, the water commissioner
was working

39:35.707 --> 39:37.242
for you the whole time.

39:37.342 --> 39:39.511
Well, I don't have a problem
kicking both of your asses.

39:39.611 --> 39:44.416
Oh, I'd be a little more worried
about the other guy.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.588
(roaring)

39:49.688 --> 39:50.922
(screeching)

39:51.022 --> 39:53.825
ManBearPig.
He's working for you, too?

39:53.925 --> 39:56.928
Everybody wants to get
in the streaming business.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.430
You're the one who bought
all the properties

39:58.530 --> 39:59.865
on the mountaintop.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.399
You just have it all
figured out, don't you?

40:01.500 --> 40:05.103
Yeah, looks like-a Pi Pi
has it all pretty figured out.

40:05.203 --> 40:08.106
Goddamn it, I'm not gonna
let you... (screams)

40:12.778 --> 40:15.046
(screams)

40:18.784 --> 40:21.520
(choking)

40:21.620 --> 40:23.722
I'm sorry, Pi Pi can't hear you.

40:26.558 --> 40:27.793
(screaming)

40:35.834 --> 40:38.003
(screaming)

40:52.584 --> 40:54.152
How is he?

40:54.252 --> 40:58.123
I believe he's
coming to, Doctor.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.258
(groaning)

41:01.459 --> 41:04.429
Hello, Eric. Just want to let
you know everything went fine.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.131
We're gonna let
the anesthesia wear off

41:06.231 --> 41:08.166
a little more, and then
we can let you go home.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.668
(stammers)

41:09.768 --> 41:11.970
Okay. Um, cool.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.605
CARTMAN'S MOM:
Well, you did it, Eric.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.874
I hope you're happier now.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.043
They all said
you were very insistent.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.078
That you said you'd
cancel them if they didn't

41:20.178 --> 41:21.780
put breast implants
in one of us.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.882
I-I...

41:23.982 --> 41:25.984
I-I have fake tits?

41:28.286 --> 41:29.955
CARTMAN'S MOM:
They said that tube

41:30.055 --> 41:32.290
is for draining blood
while the swelling goes down.

41:32.390 --> 41:36.261
Your breasts are swollen now
as a reaction to the implants.

41:36.361 --> 41:39.531
Okay, well, now that you see
how serious I was,

41:39.631 --> 41:41.132
what're you gonna do now?

41:41.232 --> 41:44.202
I'm gonna go down and
get some grocery shopping done.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.237
Mom?

41:46.337 --> 41:48.907
I will go to school like this.

41:49.007 --> 41:52.077
You're gonna have to give in
at some point.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.445
Mom?

41:54.546 --> 41:57.415
(school bell rings)

41:57.515 --> 41:59.350
Well, have you guys seen
Butters or Cartman?

41:59.450 --> 42:01.319
-What the hell is going on?
-I don't know, but we have

42:01.419 --> 42:03.054
a lot of boats to make,
and recess is almost over.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.355
You guys. You guys.

42:04.455 --> 42:06.257
There you are.
What's wrong dude?

42:06.357 --> 42:10.095
Um, we need to stop making stuff
for streaming services.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.262
What're you talking about?

42:11.362 --> 42:13.064
It's all getting really weird.

42:13.164 --> 42:15.934
The guy we made the deal with?
He was killed.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.235
He was killed?

42:17.335 --> 42:19.671
I think we got greedy.
I got greedy.

42:19.771 --> 42:21.840
We should've never gotten
involved in the streaming wars.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.709
They've upset
the balance of nature.

42:23.809 --> 42:24.743
Hey, whoa, whoa, Stan.

42:24.843 --> 42:26.444
We weren't greedy, okay?

42:26.544 --> 42:28.046
We made the money
for a good reason.

42:28.146 --> 42:29.347
Yeah, dude. Don't forget,

42:29.447 --> 42:31.049
everything we did
was for a good cause.

42:31.149 --> 42:32.050
CARTMAN:
You guys.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.752
You guys, something

42:33.852 --> 42:36.354
is seriously wrong with my mom.

42:36.454 --> 42:38.624
She's acting crazy.

42:38.724 --> 42:41.559
Are any of your parents
acting weird at all?

42:41.660 --> 42:44.963
Hey, fellas, are we making more
boats for the-- Whoa, hello!

42:45.063 --> 42:47.065
Jesus, what happened
to you, Eric?

42:47.165 --> 42:49.167
Okay, okay, fine. I was hoping

42:49.267 --> 42:50.802
everyone would just be cool,

42:50.902 --> 42:53.605
but I guess we need to talk
about the elephants in the room.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.373
This was not a choice.

42:55.473 --> 42:57.142
You guys, I...

42:57.242 --> 43:00.145
I live in a hot dog, okay?

43:00.245 --> 43:02.247
And all I want
is to have a real home,

43:02.347 --> 43:04.616
and a room that is mine
to sleep in at night.

43:04.716 --> 43:06.051
To-- Is something funny, Clyde?

43:06.151 --> 43:08.119
(stifled laughter)

43:08.219 --> 43:09.855
Yeah, it's real funny.

43:09.955 --> 43:11.389
If I were you guys,
I'd be super pissed

43:11.489 --> 43:13.158
at my mom because you
worked hard for this money.

43:13.258 --> 43:14.960
All right, Cartman,
stop fucking around.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.327
Obviously, those aren't real.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.030
I didn't say they're real.
They're not real.

43:19.130 --> 43:20.932
They're silicone implants
surgically inserted

43:21.032 --> 43:22.367
under the chest muscle.

43:22.467 --> 43:23.935
Nobody believes
you actually got fake tits.

43:24.035 --> 43:25.436
These are real fake tits.

43:25.536 --> 43:28.206
Kenny, feel them.
Go on. feel them.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.113
Those are fucking real, dude.

43:35.213 --> 43:36.614
-What?
-Thank you, Kenny.

43:36.715 --> 43:38.483
Now, if we can all get our minds
off fucking boobs

43:38.583 --> 43:40.819
for a second,
something's happened to my mom.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.988
TOLKIEN:
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

43:43.088 --> 43:46.157
Mom, slow down,
I can't understand you.

43:47.726 --> 43:49.527
What do you mean Dad is missing?

43:49.627 --> 43:51.663
See?

43:56.067 --> 43:58.670
I want to congratulate you,
Pi Pi.

43:58.770 --> 44:01.172
It appears you've won
the streaming wars.

44:01.272 --> 44:04.976
And I want to thank-a you
for your service.

44:05.076 --> 44:07.178
It's been-a nice
working with you.

44:07.278 --> 44:10.048
(chuckles) You think it's over?

44:10.148 --> 44:11.717
You're gonna need me
more than ever.

44:11.817 --> 44:15.253
Oh, but, uh, but I have-a
everything I need now.

44:15.353 --> 44:17.488
Water?

44:17.588 --> 44:19.624
You silly little guy.

44:19.725 --> 44:22.427
You really think you own
all the water now?

44:22.527 --> 44:25.163
You know who actually
owns the water?

44:25.263 --> 44:27.065
The State of Colorado.

44:27.165 --> 44:28.800
Every drop that rains
from the sky.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.636
Your little water rights
won't mean anything when Arizona

44:31.737 --> 44:34.773
comes knocking, when Kansas
wants all their water.

44:34.873 --> 44:37.342
Oh, no. You make-a Pi Pi worry.

44:37.442 --> 44:40.912
You're gonna need me
for a long time, buddy.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.548
You know who
really own the water?

44:43.648 --> 44:44.883
Nobody.

44:44.983 --> 44:46.151
Now, the people a Denver,

44:46.251 --> 44:48.153
they think they have-a
plenty of water,

44:48.253 --> 44:50.555
so they gonna go and use it all.

44:50.655 --> 44:53.391
And when all
the water is-a gone,

44:53.491 --> 44:57.462
there's only one thing left
for people to use.

44:57.562 --> 45:01.632
The one thing that-a Pi Pi have
more than everybody, huh?

45:04.669 --> 45:07.705
No, no, no. It's good.
It's completely safe.

45:07.806 --> 45:09.140
Just a little salty, eh?

45:09.240 --> 45:12.177
You're planning on selling piss?

45:12.277 --> 45:14.245
It's-a, it's-a destiny.

45:14.345 --> 45:16.381
All the fresh water go bye-bye.

45:16.481 --> 45:19.417
Everybody gonna have to wash
their clothes in pee.

45:19.517 --> 45:22.120
Brush their teeth in pee, no?

45:22.220 --> 45:24.589
And who has the most pee

45:24.689 --> 45:26.657
in all the land-a?

45:26.758 --> 45:29.227
Only a psychopath
would speed up climate change

45:29.327 --> 45:30.862
for his own profit.

45:30.962 --> 45:34.199
Yeah, well, you see, ManBearPig,

45:34.299 --> 45:38.136
eventually,
he gonna kill everybody.

45:38.236 --> 45:41.339
He just gonna kill you first.

45:42.340 --> 45:44.542
-(screaming)
-(roaring)

45:50.048 --> 45:51.749
("Use Me"
by Bill Withers playing)

45:51.850 --> 45:54.285
(water commissioner
continues screaming)

46:00.758 --> 46:03.494
* They keep trying to tell me *

46:05.997 --> 46:09.734
* All you want to do is use me *

46:12.904 --> 46:15.406
* Uh-huh, but my answer *

46:18.043 --> 46:21.579
* Yeah, to all that
use me stuff *

46:24.983 --> 46:27.552
* I-I-I, yes, I want *

46:27.652 --> 46:29.420

46:29.520 --> 46:31.756
* That if it feels this good
getting used *

46:31.857 --> 46:34.192
* Oh, you just keep on
using me... *

46:34.292 --> 46:36.527
(laughter)

46:37.628 --> 46:40.231
* Until you use me up *

46:43.501 --> 46:46.771
* Until you use me up *

46:51.242 --> 46:53.711
* My brother *

46:56.347 --> 46:57.615
* Sit me right down *

46:57.715 --> 47:00.251
* And he talked to me *

47:01.853 --> 47:03.488
* Uh-huh *

47:03.588 --> 47:06.157
* And I want
to spread the news *

47:06.257 --> 47:09.194
* That if it feels this good
getting used *

47:09.294 --> 47:13.364
* Girl, you just
keep on using me *

47:14.265 --> 47:17.335
* Until you use me up *

47:20.571 --> 47:23.674
* Until you use me up *

47:27.245 --> 47:29.580
* They keep trying to tell me *

47:32.583 --> 47:36.321
* All you want to do is use me *

47:39.457 --> 47:42.393
* Uh-huh, but my answer *

47:42.493 --> 47:44.762
* Uh-huh *

47:44.862 --> 47:48.533
* Yeah, to all that
use me stuff *

47:51.669 --> 47:55.606
* I-I-I, yes, I want
to spread the news *

47:55.706 --> 47:58.609
* That if it feels this good
getting used *

47:58.709 --> 48:02.613
* Oh, you just
keep on using me. *
