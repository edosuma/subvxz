17:50.286 --> 17:51.592
- I want to talk to her.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.554
[door opens]

18:05.214 --> 18:06.911
[chuckles]

18:06.955 --> 18:08.261
You're not enlisted yet.

18:08.304 --> 18:09.740
No need to salute me.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.090
- Sorry, sir.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.569
- Don't be sorry.
Have a seat.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.184
Your test scores are ...
unusual.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.795
Once every five or
so years unusual.

18:20.838 --> 18:25.147
I'd park you in psy-ops,
but your PT test...

18:25.191 --> 18:27.323
No woman has done this.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.672
Most men don't.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.892
Twenty-two pull ups,
114 push ups

18:30.935 --> 18:33.764
in 3 minutes, and you ran an
eight minute mile and a half.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.288
The standard is fifteen.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.768
- I ran the 800
in high school, sir.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.944
Threw the javelin.
Won state in both.

18:39.988 --> 18:42.077
- I'm aware.
Did my homework on you.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.297
What I don't understand is
why you didn't go to college.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.386
Why are you here and
not achieving all the things

18:46.429 --> 18:48.344
that these tests say you
should be achieving?

18:51.434 --> 18:54.176
- Mother died in junior year.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.221
I just Stopped caring.

18:57.353 --> 19:01.270
Hated myself.
Hated the world.

19:01.314 --> 19:02.663
And I treated myself like it.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.580
- Father?
- Who knows? I don't.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.626
- So no family.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.150
- One brother dead
and one in prison

19:11.193 --> 19:13.630
if you call that family.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.893
- What does the word
"Marine" mean to you?

19:18.505 --> 19:19.810
- I don't know.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.639
- Then why are we talking?

19:22.683 --> 19:23.814
Why are you here?

19:25.076 --> 19:28.863
[music]

19:28.906 --> 19:32.345
- I was being hunted and
I pushed through these doors

19:32.388 --> 19:36.000
and a Marine was there
and he protected me.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.306
He offered me a chance--

19:37.350 --> 19:39.917
- So you do know what it means.

19:39.961 --> 19:42.181
We are the strong.
We protect the weak.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.312
We are merciless
in that endeavor.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.662
Is that an endeavor
you wish to pursue?

19:45.706 --> 19:47.273
- Yes, sir.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.666
- There's 1.4 Million active
duty personnel

19:49.710 --> 19:51.015
in the armed forces.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.670
They all do their part.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.237
But there's not a thousand
among them

19:55.281 --> 19:57.239
that we can call on
that make a difference.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.374
I think you could be
one of those few.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.332
But it means walking away
from the life

20:03.376 --> 20:07.031
that you lived up to this point
and never looking back.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.250
That life is over.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.906
- I have no life, sir.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.214
- You do now.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.868
[music]

20:23.134 --> 20:26.486
[music]

20:26.529 --> 20:29.053
[Joe] She was compromised.
- Compromised how?

20:29.097 --> 20:32.361
Her mark walked in on
her bathing and saw...

20:32.405 --> 20:34.494
[sigh]

20:34.537 --> 20:36.800
Saw the tattoo of
a cross beneath her armpit.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.282
- A tattoo?

20:40.326 --> 20:42.066
- Yes, sir.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.764
- You didn't think to check
your operative for tattoos?

20:43.807 --> 20:45.505
- I asked her if she had tattoos
and she said no.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.420
- And you just took her word
for it?

20:47.463 --> 20:48.334
Would you rather I strip
searched her in the barracks?

20:48.377 --> 20:49.770
- That's exactly what I--

20:49.813 --> 20:51.380
- Regulations forbid--

20:51.424 --> 20:53.295
- Fuck's sake, Joe.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.992
Regulations?

20:55.036 --> 20:57.430
Stop acting like this is
your first day on the job.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.693
- Walk us through your decision
to call a drone strike.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.477
- ISIS members
had her in custody.

21:01.521 --> 21:02.957
- You knew this how?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.567
- I heard it through
my sat phone.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.787
- You had a CAG team en route.
- Two. And my team.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.528
- And you still ordered
the strike.

21:08.571 --> 21:09.703
- There were more than
forty ISIS fighters

21:09.746 --> 21:12.314
at that location prepared
for our assault.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.448
At best, it takes my team an
hour to secure the location.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.014
And during that time
I God damn guarantee

21:17.058 --> 21:18.668
they've strip searched her

21:18.712 --> 21:20.801
and made a home movie
we don't want on the internet.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.979
She was dead either way.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.633
I chose to protect my team

21:26.676 --> 21:28.983
and the sanctity
of our operation.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.465
- Check the next one
for tattoos.

21:33.727 --> 21:34.771
Every inch of her.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.479
- Fucking asshole.

21:46.522 --> 21:49.438
- Debriefs are unpleasant
for a reason, Joe.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.093
I can assure you his debrief
will be that and worse.

21:52.136 --> 21:53.529
- Good.

21:53.573 --> 21:54.791
What next?

21:54.835 --> 21:57.011
- Go to Bragg.
Make another one.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.492
- [scoffs]

22:01.885 --> 22:03.409
- It's not your fault, Joe.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.758
She lied to you.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.542
- I trusted her.

22:06.586 --> 22:07.891
I know better than that.

22:09.719 --> 22:11.504
Twenty two years-old.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.636
Her whole life ahead of her

22:13.680 --> 22:14.811
and I just dropped
a missile on it.

22:16.422 --> 22:17.945
[music]

22:35.266 --> 22:36.659
[crickets]

22:50.281 --> 22:53.067
[child laughing]

22:53.110 --> 22:54.721
- You say you don't like them
but I've never

22:54.764 --> 22:55.939
seen you try them.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.550
- I've tried them.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.116
- Honey, grits
don't have a taste.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.641
They taste like whatever
you put in it.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.252
And I put cheese in it
because you like cheese.

23:04.295 --> 23:07.516
- It's not the taste.
It's the texture.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.563
Mom!
[laughs]

23:11.477 --> 23:14.262
- Oh!
Oh my God...

23:14.305 --> 23:15.698
You're so big.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.570
Let me see you.

23:20.660 --> 23:21.791
- No phone call?

23:21.835 --> 23:25.665
- Thought I'd surprise you.

23:25.708 --> 23:26.840
- Well, you achieved your goal.

23:29.756 --> 23:30.931
You hungry?

23:31.932 --> 23:33.586
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.924
[door opens]

24:07.968 --> 24:09.622
[door closes]

24:09.665 --> 24:10.840
- I hate it when she's here.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.321
- Hey. We don't say that.
Finish your meal.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.279
You, finish whatever
it is you're willing to eat.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.518
- When you call first,

24:36.562 --> 24:38.738
I can download you on
what they've been doing.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.000
Then they aren't
ambushed at dinner

24:40.043 --> 24:41.523
and you have something to say.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.658
- I didn't know
I was coming back.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.660
Thought about staying at Bragg,
calling tomorrow, but...

24:47.703 --> 24:49.183
- You don't need permission
to come home.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.968
I'm just trying to
make the landing softer.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.365
- Yard looks nice.

24:57.408 --> 25:00.063
- You're staying fit out there
in the desert, I see.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.066
- Who said desert?

25:03.110 --> 25:04.807
- Just a guess.

25:07.244 --> 25:08.637
[music]

25:13.033 --> 25:16.645
[water running]

25:52.115 --> 25:53.290
- You seeing anyone?

25:55.118 --> 25:56.859
- No. Not really.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.166
- You?

26:01.908 --> 26:03.779
Just... You know.
To feel something.

26:03.823 --> 26:05.694
Anything...

26:05.738 --> 26:07.566
- That's what I meant
by not really.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.877
You're right.
I should've called first.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.792
Then everyone knows how
to play their role.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.709
- How long you staying?

26:25.888 --> 26:26.976
- Not long.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.371
- [chuckles]

26:30.414 --> 26:32.199
Well, they say love
is all you need.

26:32.242 --> 26:35.768
- That's not a saying, baby.
That's a song.

26:52.219 --> 26:53.786
- If your theater
is the Middle East,

26:53.829 --> 26:57.224
I have seven that could
work, but this one...

26:57.267 --> 26:58.529
Fucking pipe hitter, this girl.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.662
- She's from Mexico, Jack.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.795
- Father's Syrian,
mother from Jalisco.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.145
- Muslim?
- Catholic.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.581
- How's her Arabic?

27:06.625 --> 27:07.669
- Clean.
Done four language courses.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.236
Keeps up with it good ...

27:09.279 --> 27:11.760
- She did a tour in Afghanistan?
- Two.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.849
She was Force Recon
before we got her.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.764
H.A.L.O. jumps in country.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.548
Passed S.E.R.E. school
on her first go.

27:17.592 --> 27:19.202
She's a fucking gangster.

27:19.246 --> 27:20.639
- She's a fucking
door kicker.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.162
Fuck am I gonna do with
a door kicker, Jack?

27:22.205 --> 27:25.339
- She's got a brain.
She tested top ten percent

27:25.382 --> 27:26.775
on the officer's scale.

27:26.819 --> 27:29.169
She's been in insertion
training for six months.

27:29.212 --> 27:30.692
I'm telling you.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.694
- I don't like my assets
picked for me, Jack.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.437
- See for yourself.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.833
[grunting]

27:46.752 --> 27:49.929
- Manuelos, Hastings.
In the pit.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.804
Sergeant Hastings.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.852
- Give him a helmet.
- I don't need a helmet.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.462
- You're gonna need a helmet.

28:01.505 --> 28:04.900
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

28:04.944 --> 28:05.901
Oh!

28:05.945 --> 28:07.990
[grunting]

28:08.034 --> 28:11.777
[shouts]

28:11.820 --> 28:12.734
[grunts]

28:27.967 --> 28:29.708
[Hastings] Like fighting
a fucking raccoon!

28:29.751 --> 28:30.752
[Cruz] Told you
you needed a helmet.

28:30.796 --> 28:31.884
- Fuck you!

28:38.978 --> 28:42.459
- At ease, Manuelos.
I'm not an officer.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.461
- Who are you with?

28:44.505 --> 28:45.767
- Special Activities.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.551
You wanted your chance,
so here it is.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.945
- When?
- Classified.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.468
- Where?
- Classified.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.253
I'm not done vetting you yet.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.950
- I was vetted before they
let me in the program.

28:54.994 --> 28:56.473
- Not my program.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.608
When the Lioness team
was first formed,

29:00.651 --> 29:02.741
we just needed
female soldiers

29:02.784 --> 29:04.830
to frisk and interrogate
female insurgents.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.440
We can't have a man
running his hand

29:06.483 --> 29:08.790
over some Muslim
teenager's groin.

29:08.834 --> 29:12.794
What it has evolved to...

29:12.838 --> 29:17.843
What we do now is locate
the wives and the girlfriends

29:17.886 --> 29:20.846
and daughters of
these high-value targets,

29:20.889 --> 29:23.283
and we place an operative
close to them.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.894
The operative makes
friends with them.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.809
Earns their trust.

29:27.853 --> 29:31.595
Leads us to the target,
and we kill the target.

29:33.119 --> 29:34.947
Some might consider
that cruel

29:34.990 --> 29:38.515
and outside the lines
of what's just.

29:38.559 --> 29:41.301
What do you think?

29:41.344 --> 29:44.434
- I think if you ain't cheatin'
you ain't tryin', ma'am.

29:44.478 --> 29:45.609
- You got any tattoos?

29:45.653 --> 29:46.697
- No, ma'am.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.617
- Prove it.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.424
All of it.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.486
[music]

30:38.097 --> 30:39.402
Lift your arms.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.800
What are those?

30:45.844 --> 30:47.367
- From cigarettes.

30:48.629 --> 30:49.804
Turn around.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.162
Those are from
an extension cord.

31:00.206 --> 31:01.860
Should answer your question
about how much pain I can take.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.430
And this should tell
you how much indignity.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.824
This is how you get off?

31:09.868 --> 31:12.914
Knock yourself out, lady, I can
stand here all fucking day.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.971
- You'll do.
Get packed.

31:26.014 --> 31:28.103
We leave 0600.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.062
[music]

31:38.940 --> 31:41.073
Asmar Ali Amrohi.

31:41.116 --> 31:43.118
One of the leaders of the
Iranian backed militia in Iraq.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.512
- He's a target?
- He isthe target.

31:45.555 --> 31:47.470
- Who's my mark?
- Daughter.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.039
- They have money.

31:51.083 --> 31:54.042
She's young so she
likes to spend it.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.043
Where can you spend
it in Baghdad?

31:55.087 --> 31:56.915
- You can't.
You spend it in Kuwait.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.133
- Is that where we're going?

31:58.177 --> 31:58.917
- It's where we're starting.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.619
- You're not married?

32:05.662 --> 32:08.230
- Hey. We don't do that.

32:08.274 --> 32:11.233
- I'm not your friend
and you aren't mine.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.539
- Getting real tired
of you telling me

32:12.582 --> 32:14.106
what we are and
aren't gonna do.

32:14.149 --> 32:15.716
- Get used to it, because
that's our relationship.

32:15.759 --> 32:18.023
- Then turn the fucking
plane around.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.720
- [sigh]

32:22.027 --> 32:24.116
You'd like to be in charge,
is that it?

32:24.159 --> 32:26.161
With your years of experience?

32:26.205 --> 32:28.076
- I'd like to know you.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.817
I'd like to know
the person responsible

32:29.860 --> 32:32.037
with saving me
if my cover is blown.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.126
- If your cover's blown
there is no saving you.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.692
That's what this job
has taught me.

32:35.736 --> 32:39.044
You have to save yourself,
then we come get you.

32:41.698 --> 32:42.961
You can trust me to do that.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.451
[music]

33:16.690 --> 33:18.213
[MP] IDs all the way around.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.998
- Yeah. You'll get mine.

33:22.478 --> 33:23.523
- Fair enough.

33:49.810 --> 33:52.378
- Just for me?
- Just you.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.380
There's a cantina down the hall.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.903
Rest of the team
is gonna meet us there.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.731
And a cafe in case
you're hungry.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.907
- You have a cafe?

33:59.950 --> 34:01.822
- More importantly,
we have a cantina.

34:06.305 --> 34:07.915
- Do you have a mirror
under there?

34:07.958 --> 34:09.830
I know this Vegas
magician shit you're pulling.

34:09.873 --> 34:11.353
[Bobby] I'm just good.

34:11.397 --> 34:12.353
- Chief, she's cheating
at cards again.

34:12.398 --> 34:14.094
And what am I, 0 for 7,
0 for 18 now?

34:14.139 --> 34:15.096
- Stop cheating, Bobby.

34:15.139 --> 34:17.272
- Cheating?

34:17.315 --> 34:18.621
- Yeah, because next time I win
you're cleaning

34:18.665 --> 34:20.754
the fucking toilet is what
you're doing.

34:20.797 --> 34:24.670
- How do you drink that with
no ice in this fucking desert?

34:24.714 --> 34:27.369
- This is for cooling off.

34:27.413 --> 34:28.370
And this is not.

34:28.414 --> 34:29.937
- Just drink beer like me.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.243
Get both at the same time.

34:31.286 --> 34:32.505
- Then I'll look like you.

34:32.547 --> 34:34.681
[laughing]

34:34.724 --> 34:36.422
- That our little sparrow?

34:36.465 --> 34:38.380
- The one and only.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.165
- Hey, if you're here
to purify the water,

34:40.208 --> 34:41.601
it's right around the corner.
Thank you very much.

34:41.643 --> 34:43.559
Thank you for your service.

34:43.603 --> 34:44.560
Just fucking with her.

34:44.603 --> 34:45.822
- I'll introduce you around.

34:45.866 --> 34:48.129
This is our QRF
team leader, Bobby.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.829
This is Two Cups,
that over there is Tex,

34:52.873 --> 34:55.353
- Randy, and that's Tucker.
- [Randy clicks tongue]

34:55.397 --> 34:56.398
Why Two Cups?

34:56.442 --> 34:57.747
[laughing]

34:57.791 --> 34:59.227
[Bobby] We went
to Thailand on leave.

34:59.271 --> 35:01.403
and he drank two cups
of something and tried

35:01.447 --> 35:02.665
to fuck everything.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.363
- It was horrible.
- And we mean everything.

35:04.406 --> 35:07.714
- How many beers is that?
Just so I know where to sit.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.629
[chuckling]

35:09.672 --> 35:12.327
- Texas, huh?
- New Jersey.

35:12.371 --> 35:13.937
- When he shaves
his beard he, uh,

35:13.981 --> 35:14.982
he looks like Matt Dillon.

35:15.025 --> 35:16.201
- Don't get it.

35:16.244 --> 35:17.724
- He starred in the
movie "Tex."

35:17.767 --> 35:20.422
- Still don't get it.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.554
- So your name's Cruz, huh?

35:21.597 --> 35:22.816
What's that from?

35:22.859 --> 35:24.426
- Not a nickname.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.688
- Want a beer?

35:25.732 --> 35:26.646
- Water please.

35:26.689 --> 35:27.734
- Water?

35:29.475 --> 35:30.476
- When do we start?

35:30.519 --> 35:31.738
- His family keeps
an apartment here.

35:31.781 --> 35:32.739
We have eyes on it.

35:32.782 --> 35:33.827
When she moves we move.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.524
- Where does he stay?

35:35.568 --> 35:39.963
That's the million dollar
question you're here to answer.

35:40.007 --> 35:43.489
- Let's see that.

35:43.532 --> 35:46.448
I don't trust anyone who
doesn't get drunk with me.

35:49.016 --> 35:50.583
- When's our wake up?

35:50.626 --> 35:53.063
- Uh, we wake up
when we feel like it.

35:53.107 --> 35:55.022
That's when we wake up.

35:55.065 --> 35:57.459
- Welcome to CIA.
- Welcome to the team.

36:01.985 --> 36:03.770
- Here we go.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.293
- I think I'm in love.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.990
[Randy] Don't hurt yourself.

36:07.034 --> 36:09.471
- I'm a fucking Marine.
What did you expect?

36:09.515 --> 36:11.212
[Bobby] All right, then.
Come on, you want in?

36:11.256 --> 36:12.387
- Hey, listen she cheats
at cards so much.

36:12.431 --> 36:13.301
- Shut the fuck up.

36:13.345 --> 36:14.563
- Watch your six,
I swear to God.

36:14.607 --> 36:16.261
Hey, Tuck, can I
borrow some money?

36:17.305 --> 36:18.306
[knocking, door opens]

36:18.350 --> 36:20.482
- Let's go.

36:20.526 --> 36:21.788
There's clothes in the closet.

36:21.831 --> 36:25.357
Something cute, stylish...
[groans]

36:25.400 --> 36:27.489
Take this blue purse.
The Chanel.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.056
Meet us in the briefing
room in 15 minutes.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.624
[door closes]

36:37.456 --> 36:39.371
[music]

36:42.025 --> 36:43.026
[knocking]

36:43.070 --> 36:44.114
- Yeah, I'm coming.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.551
- Now.
She's on the move.

36:59.173 --> 37:00.522
What is your name?

37:00.566 --> 37:01.697
- Zara Adid.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.743
- Where are you from?

37:03.786 --> 37:05.527
Where the fuck are you from?

37:05.571 --> 37:07.790
- I was born in Boston but my
parents were born in Abu Dhabi.

37:07.834 --> 37:09.531
- What are you doing
in Kuwait?

37:09.575 --> 37:10.489
- My cousin.
- Uncle.

37:10.532 --> 37:11.968
- Uncle. Fuck.

37:12.012 --> 37:14.275
I'm taking a semester off school
and staying with my uncle.

37:14.319 --> 37:15.494
- What does your uncle do?

37:15.537 --> 37:17.539
- He's a producer
for Al Jazheera.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.498
- Moving on foot now.
Salhiya market.

37:19.541 --> 37:20.629
- Three blocks ahead.
- You know what she looks like?

37:20.673 --> 37:22.283
- I know what she looks like.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.067
- Look at her again.
- Wait, I don't know her name.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.591
- You're not supposed
to know her name.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.114
- You haven't met her yet.
- This is too fast.

37:27.157 --> 37:29.029
- We need to slow down.
- Too late for that.

37:29.072 --> 37:30.683
- I don't know what I'm doing.

37:30.726 --> 37:31.684
I don't know anything
about her or who she's with.

37:31.727 --> 37:32.772
- Look at me.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.904
You're not supposed to.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.472
What if you say her name

37:37.516 --> 37:40.562
or you say something she hasn't
told you about herself yet?

37:40.606 --> 37:42.390
You're blind on purpose.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.436
- Up ahead.
On the right. Get ready.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.916
- I get out first.
Do not follow me.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.744
Do not look at me.
Understood?

37:50.398 --> 37:51.530
Say it.

37:51.573 --> 37:52.661
- I understand.

37:57.013 --> 37:58.754
- Wait! Fuck.
I don't know where I'm going!

37:58.798 --> 38:00.843
- Relax. Louis Vuitton.
Fifth store on the left.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.976
Go there now.

38:03.019 --> 38:05.413
[music]

39:19.487 --> 39:20.575
- Sorry.

39:20.619 --> 39:21.750
[speaks Arabic]

39:23.578 --> 39:26.973
- American.
- Yeah.

39:33.283 --> 39:36.983
It's, uh... beautiful.

39:37.026 --> 39:39.681
- Wishful thinking.

39:39.725 --> 39:42.554
A woman can't buy
jewelry for herself.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.164
- Why not?

39:44.207 --> 39:46.732
- Because it doesn't
mean anything.

39:46.775 --> 39:48.734
It has to be given to you.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.823
You're pretty enough
to know that.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.651
- [laughs]

39:52.694 --> 39:54.217
If you wait for an
American man to buy jewelry

39:54.261 --> 39:56.176
you'll never have any.
[laughs]

39:58.700 --> 39:59.875
- You have family here?

40:02.138 --> 40:04.706
- My uncle.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.055
- Here to find a husband?

40:08.014 --> 40:10.756
Well, with that face
it won't take long.

40:10.799 --> 40:13.106
But you American girls
and make up.

40:13.149 --> 40:15.804
No subtlety.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.719
It's okay,
we go down to Estée Lauder.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.242
It's across the street.

40:20.330 --> 40:21.897
What's your name?

40:27.860 --> 40:29.296
If you don't want
my help that's fine.

40:29.339 --> 40:30.776
Just trying to be nice.

40:30.819 --> 40:33.474
- Zara. Adid.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.738
- Aaliyah Amrohi.

40:38.653 --> 40:41.308
- This will be fun.
- Yeah.

40:42.309 --> 40:43.832
[music]

41:04.113 --> 41:05.245
She's in.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.728
[music]

41:22.001 --> 41:24.569
[music]
