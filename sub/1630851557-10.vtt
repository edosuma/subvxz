WEBVTT

00:16.350 --> 00:17.601
Make a wish.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.234
All right,
we should eat this quickly and get home

00:25.317 --> 00:27.402
or your other mom
is gonna start to get jealous.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.404
But there's still so much I need to know,

00:29.488 --> 00:31.406
like what happened after you kissed Julia,

00:31.490 --> 00:33.492
or what about abuelita's eye surgery?

00:33.575 --> 00:34.952
And the New Year's party?

00:35.035 --> 00:38.205
-That's a lot to get through.
-Don't worry. I'll talk fast.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.290
The morning after the dinner,

00:40.374 --> 00:43.293
our family left for a quick trip
to Mexico City

00:43.377 --> 00:45.003
for your abuelita's eye surgery.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.423
The surgery was a success.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.342
Sara was crying.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.302
She was so happy.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.387
Please.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.931
Máximo was the one who was crying,
and he knows it.

00:57.057 --> 00:57.724
Mom!

00:57.850 --> 00:58.851
My love!

00:59.393 --> 01:00.936
Okay, your mom's right.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.438
I was crying, but that's not why.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.524
I had just seen the bill.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.193
Thank you so much, Doctor.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.696
I'm getting a promotion this week,

01:11.321 --> 01:13.532
I promise to finalize payment
before March.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.535
Okay, but if you don't finish paying
within the next three months,

01:16.660 --> 01:17.911
I will put her cataracts back in.

01:18.078 --> 01:18.787
What?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.499
We got home
and I went back to work

01:22.583 --> 01:24.001
on New Year's Eve morning.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.336
That's great about your mom,

01:26.461 --> 01:28.630
but most importantly...

01:28.797 --> 01:30.966
You and Julia kissed!

01:31.049 --> 01:32.718
That's amazing!

01:32.801 --> 01:34.386
What happened next?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.096
After that, she told me...

01:38.557 --> 01:39.892
I have to go.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.186
I just need some time to think.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.774
And we both know what that means!

01:47.858 --> 01:49.401
No, we don't!

01:49.693 --> 01:50.944
What she meant was...

01:52.487 --> 01:53.363
I have to go.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.992
I need some time to dump
my stupid boyfriend

01:57.075 --> 01:59.203
so we can be together forever.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.042
So you think she broke up with him?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.418
I hope so.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.377
Look what I bought her in Mexico City.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.672
Wow.

02:11.215 --> 02:15.385
Nothing says "I love you"
like a gift you can't afford.

02:17.262 --> 02:17.971
What about you?

02:18.514 --> 02:20.724
How did things end up with Lorena
after the dinner?

02:21.058 --> 02:22.726
Oh... not so great.

02:23.060 --> 02:23.977
Well, Memo.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.146
Thank you for being my boyfriend tonight.

02:26.522 --> 02:27.147
Bye.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.367
I tried to explain it wasn't real.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.161
But since then,
Lupe won't leave me alone with Lorena.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.579
Not even for a second.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.922
I have to find a way to be with Lorena
at the New Year's Eve party tonight.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.216
This is a big day for both of us!

02:54.299 --> 02:56.635
I'm getting promoted and by midnight,

02:56.718 --> 02:59.304
we'll both be
with the women of our dreams.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.931
Or die trying.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.142
I'm not joking.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.019
Lupe could really kill me.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.981
Promise me you'll look after my sisters.

03:15.279 --> 03:18.365
-Then I saw Chad.
-Máximo!

03:18.448 --> 03:20.534
And he seemed pissed.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.996
Missed you around here, "hermigo."

03:24.079 --> 03:25.539
Or maybe he wasn't.

03:25.622 --> 03:29.084
-So how are you?
-I'm not gonna lie, it's been tough.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.627
Oh, you poor thing.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.339
Well, stay strong. Your heart will heal.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.717
My heart? No, it's my head.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.261
I'm trying to learn Spanish for Julia.
It's been brutal.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.389
Like, I thought Spanish was just adding
an "o" to the end of every English word,

03:42.472 --> 03:44.975
but apparently, it's way more complicated.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.269
Julia, your girlfriend?

03:47.352 --> 03:49.438
Yeah, her. So here's a question.

03:49.521 --> 03:53.025
So… "siempre" means "forever," right?

03:54.985 --> 03:57.779
And "siempre" also means "always."

03:59.031 --> 04:00.616
So how the hell do you say
"always and forever"?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.744
For siempre and for siempre.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.954
Dude, your language cracks me up.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.498
English is a nightmare.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.335
"There," "their" and "they're"
are all different words.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.338
A groom is someone you marry,
but it's also what you do to a horse.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.589
What is that?

04:18.007 --> 04:21.803
Somehow, Julia had not yet
decided to break up with Chad.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.430
I was very confused.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.102
Mom, Juan Gabriel is here!

04:29.436 --> 04:31.522
No no no, It's me, Esteban!

04:33.774 --> 04:36.235
Oh no, I thought your bandages
had been removed.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.903
Not yet. One more night.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.030
Well, then, just so you know,

04:40.364 --> 04:41.657
I am looking handsome today.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.408
I brought flowers
and I'm wearing a new suit.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.701
I got a haircut...

04:44.952 --> 04:45.786
I'm taller...

04:46.870 --> 04:48.539
And now my eyes are blue!

04:50.249 --> 04:51.333
Well, if you'll excuse me.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.001
Here are some flowers.

04:54.545 --> 04:55.504
Thank you.

05:01.218 --> 05:01.677
Nora,

05:03.387 --> 05:04.847
this is hard for me to say,

05:05.013 --> 05:05.848
but I have to be bold.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.475
You know my feelings towards you.

05:09.101 --> 05:12.020
There's nothing I would love more
than to spend New Year's Eve with you.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.231
But I think it's your turn to invite me.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.025
I need to know
if you are truly interested.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.027
You know where to find me.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.320
If you'll excuse me.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.702
But in case you don't know,
I'll be at the bus station until 6pm.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.496
Also, it takes me 10 minutes
to walk back home.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.373
Then you can find me at home.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.249
Okay?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.458
By the way...

05:33.542 --> 05:35.252
Okay, bye.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.503
If you'll excuse me.
Thank you.

05:44.845 --> 05:45.888
Mom.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.223
I need to tell you something.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.477
I hope it's "I'm sorry for walking out
of our posada the other night."

05:52.561 --> 05:54.229
You may have been trying to hurt me,

05:54.313 --> 05:57.191
but really, you hurt everyone
who didn't get to hear me sing.

05:57.274 --> 06:01.236
No. Tonight I'm proposing to Julia,

06:01.320 --> 06:03.530
and I would like
the family ring to do it with.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.576
Can I talk you out of this later?

06:08.160 --> 06:09.745
I'm about to meet with the investors

06:09.828 --> 06:11.997
that could determine
the fate of our resort.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.124
So forgive me for seeming distracted.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.335
Mom, I am serious about this.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.586
I am too.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.589
-I like Julia very much.
-Julia.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.675
But you're only dating her
because she's right in front of you.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.053
Just like you always fill up
on bread at restaurants.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.555
-Julia is bread.
-Julia.

06:28.639 --> 06:32.142
No. The other day,
you asked me what do I want in life,

06:32.226 --> 06:33.227
and I thought about it.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.020
And the answer is Julia.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.231
Well, I'm sure you believe that,

06:37.314 --> 06:40.567
but I'm gonna need better decision-making
from my general manager.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.988
Well, then maybe you need
a different general manager.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.001
Don Pablo,

06:59.002 --> 06:59.795
are you okay?

07:01.338 --> 07:02.589
Excuse me, Máximo.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.885
New Year's has always been
difficult for me.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.681
Now, what can I do for you?

07:11.348 --> 07:14.434
It's about that promotion
to head of pool operations.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.770
My mother's eye surgery was expensive.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.272
We really need that money.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.274
So...

07:21.024 --> 07:23.277
when can I start making the big bucks?

07:23.902 --> 07:26.363
I may have given you the wrong impression.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.074
The promotion is not certain.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.784
It isn't?

07:31.535 --> 07:34.204
Ultimately, it's Diane's choice.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.248
And there is another candidate.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.292
Who is it?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.376
Héctor.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.087
But I need this, Don Pablo.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.964
Plus, I'm better than Héctor in every way.

07:44.548 --> 07:45.966
Yeah.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.927
How can I prove to Diane
that I deserve this more?

07:51.305 --> 07:54.141
She is about to give some investors
a tour of the resort,

07:54.224 --> 07:55.475
starting at the pool.

07:56.059 --> 08:00.522
If you can help her,
she will owe you that promotion.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.994
I desperately wanted
to tell Julia how much I loved her

08:14.661 --> 08:17.164
and find out exactly
what she was feeling too.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.752
But I decided it had to wait.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.756
I still think about that moment, Hugo.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.469
What would've changed had I gone to Julia
and talked to her instead?

08:51.114 --> 08:53.867
Diane,
we love that this resort is family owned,

08:53.951 --> 08:57.579
but our investors are concerned
that you are from the US.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.582
They prefer businesses
that embrace their local communities

09:00.666 --> 09:05.212
and work for the interests
of Mexicans and all Latin Americans.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.800
Well, honestly, I feel like I'm part
of the local community.

09:10.259 --> 09:13.053
Oh really?
So what do you like most about this city?

09:15.264 --> 09:16.974
Welcome to Las Colinas!

09:17.057 --> 09:19.142
Our guests rave about our seafood towers,

09:19.226 --> 09:21.895
so I took the liberty of preordering
for you to try.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.522
Oh, how thoughtful.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.483
Máximo here is one of our finest.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.568
Diane, if I may?

09:28.527 --> 09:30.821
Las Colinas has been
a blessing to our community.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.906
When my mother found out I got a job here,

09:32.990 --> 09:35.742
let's just say
it was a very religious moment.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.037
We just returned from Mexico City.

09:39.121 --> 09:42.666
She was able to get her eye surgery
thanks to Diane's generosity.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.543
Oh, that's so wonderful to hear, man.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.295
Thank you for sharing, Máximo.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.131
Trust me, this man is going places.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.300
Thanks, Diane.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.678
I hope, by the end of the night,
I can show you

09:54.761 --> 09:58.640
we really are one big family
here at Las Colinas.

09:59.224 --> 10:04.104
With my promotion secured,
I could finally focus on talking to Julia.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.189
Are you leaving now?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.107
Yeah, to get dressed for the party.

10:07.191 --> 10:10.944
-But there's so much I want to say to you.
-Me too. But can we talk tonight?

10:11.028 --> 10:13.655
Of course. I'll be the one
serving water at your fancy table.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.616
I'll make sure I'm thirsty then.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.827
And then she left.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.372
I wish I knew what
she'd been thinking that day.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.292
Well, I know.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.628
Well, don't you remember?

10:27.711 --> 10:30.172
Julia and I got pretty close
over the next few years.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.758
What do you know
about Julia's side of the story?

10:32.841 --> 10:36.261
Well, it started
after your kiss on the balcony.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.722
I should go.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.141
I need time to think.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.060
Julia felt guilty.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.646
She just kissed someone
who wasn't her boyfriend.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.814
But she was also confused.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.776
As she told me later, Chad adored her,

10:50.859 --> 10:53.070
but Máximo understood her.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.197
What was she to do? And then…

10:55.280 --> 10:56.365
Julia.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.118
-Hey. Can we talk?
-Yeah.

11:00.786 --> 11:03.705
Look, I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.124
Course not. Why?

11:06.917 --> 11:09.127
The dress was all Máximo's idea, okay?
He did everything.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.171
I shouldn't have lied
and said that it was my idea.

11:11.255 --> 11:13.924
It's just that I know
I'm not good enough for you.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.175
I never have been.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.595
I mean, maybe my hair is good enough,
but that's it.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.305
But I'm trying, okay? I'm trying.

11:20.389 --> 11:23.350
And you're, like, the only person
that gets that I'm trying

11:23.433 --> 11:25.310
and isn't always just disappointed.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.898
I need to stop worrying
about those other people

11:29.982 --> 11:32.401
and just try to be better for you.

11:34.361 --> 11:38.073
So could we forget the past
and just start over?

11:43.078 --> 11:44.079
Thank you.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.706
I love you.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.500
On the one hand, there was Chad,

11:48.584 --> 11:51.003
devoted, earnest, rich,

11:51.086 --> 11:54.464
but also someone
who would never truly get Julia.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.759
On the other hand, there was my brother.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.804
Mom, why won't you give Esteban a chance?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.974
Come on, you're obsessed with that!
Maybe you should go out with him.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.684
But you like him, don't you?

12:06.185 --> 12:06.894
Yes.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.688
I just don't know if it's right.

12:11.440 --> 12:11.899
Come.

12:12.149 --> 12:12.482
Leave that here.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.025
What?

12:13.108 --> 12:14.193
Let's go talk to dad.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.862
Máximo, come here.

12:19.907 --> 12:20.866
Dad,

12:21.074 --> 12:24.369
you know mom loves you,
and misses you every day.

12:24.453 --> 12:27.331
But she's also sad because
she feels lonely without you.

12:27.623 --> 12:30.709
Could you please tell her
it's okay to not be lonely,

12:30.792 --> 12:33.378
and that you want her to be happy?

12:42.387 --> 12:43.138
It's okay.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.266
Yes, I know.

12:48.727 --> 12:49.770
I will do it.

13:12.251 --> 13:13.836
Thank you.

13:18.674 --> 13:19.299
What?

13:20.676 --> 13:22.803
You think I should buy a Vespa?

13:23.178 --> 13:25.013
Whatever you say!

13:25.389 --> 13:26.890
He didn't say that.

13:27.224 --> 13:31.311
The last night of 1984
was going to be a big night for everyone.

14:11.894 --> 14:15.355
There she was. Gorgeous as always.

14:15.439 --> 14:19.902
I had been waiting all day
to talk to her and now we could finally…

14:19.985 --> 14:21.028
Nope.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.699
Everyone.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.745
I want you to meet someone
who's very special to my son

14:29.828 --> 14:31.288
and, of course, myself.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.081
This is our Julia.

14:33.165 --> 14:37.044
She's from Colombia,
and she's my son's girlfriend.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.755
When people say we've embraced
Latin American cultures around us,

14:39.838 --> 14:42.257
I say we sure have, literally.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.427
Oh, Julia. Why don't you tell them
about that business plan

14:45.511 --> 14:47.429
-we're hatching together.
-Yeah.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.056
Chad, a moment?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.310
Darling, I have something for you.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.981
-The family ring. But I thought--
-I've thought about it.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.483
You're right. You know your own heart.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.735
If Julia's the one,
then you should propose to her.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.154
Wow. I don't know what to say.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.031
Well, how were you planning to do it?

15:06.865 --> 15:09.076
I don't know. I just--

15:09.159 --> 15:13.288
You know, I…
thought maybe something quiet, simple.

15:13.372 --> 15:14.581
I wrote out a few words.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.125
I'm sure that'll be just fine.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.337
Wait, what do you mean?

15:22.798 --> 15:28.470
I don't know. I just wonder
if she deserves something more.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.399
Lorena?

15:42.693 --> 15:43.694
Lolo?

15:51.910 --> 15:58.125
Do you think you can send each other
notes, without me finding out?

15:58.917 --> 16:01.336
I already told you, Lorena is
the most important person in my life.

16:01.420 --> 16:05.090
The only daughter, from my only sister.
And you betrayed her!

16:05.174 --> 16:06.842
No, I told you. It's not what it seems...

16:06.925 --> 16:09.428
Was that woman at dinner with you a date?

16:09.803 --> 16:10.846
Yes, but I was just...

16:10.929 --> 16:12.264
Does she have feelings for you?

16:12.639 --> 16:13.849
Yes, obviously...

16:14.266 --> 16:15.475
She's crazy about me.

16:16.226 --> 16:19.646
But only because I've been such
a great male role model in her life, so...

16:19.730 --> 16:20.397
Cut it out!

16:20.480 --> 16:24.109
I won't let my niece get involved

16:24.193 --> 16:26.945
with some scheming Don Juan

16:27.112 --> 16:27.487
who...

16:28.238 --> 16:30.657
uses his sex appeal to seduce women.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.367
Is that how you think of me?

16:32.618 --> 16:35.037
Swear to me
that you'll stay away from her,

16:35.120 --> 16:38.373
or the physical damage
I'll do to your body

16:38.457 --> 16:41.585
will only be the beginning
of your suffering.

16:41.919 --> 16:42.628
Got it?

16:45.297 --> 16:46.048
I get it...

16:47.925 --> 16:49.176
But I can't promise you anything.

16:49.760 --> 16:50.302
What did you just say?

16:50.802 --> 16:52.804
We can't tell our hearts what to do, Lupe!

16:53.347 --> 16:54.848
I truly like Lorena and

16:55.349 --> 16:56.975
she likes me too.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.980
So I want to see what happens between us.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.193
I admire your strength,

17:06.609 --> 17:08.987
but I don't envy your future.

17:17.037 --> 17:17.663
Esteban!

17:17.913 --> 17:20.123
Thank you for accepting our invitation.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.416
These are for you.

17:22.626 --> 17:25.087
Oh! The flowers I brought you earlier.

17:25.337 --> 17:27.256
Such a charming present.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.174
Charming and thoughtful.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.342
Gabriela!

17:31.051 --> 17:31.802
Oh my God,

17:32.052 --> 17:32.970
Roberta!

17:33.220 --> 17:34.012
Roberta!

17:34.096 --> 17:35.597
Hi, Esteban!

17:35.973 --> 17:37.224
I had my mom invite her

17:37.307 --> 17:39.977
because we didn't want Máximo's girlfriend
to be alone on New Year's Eve.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.744
Almost midnight.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.706
Diane, everything this evening
has been excellent.

18:00.789 --> 18:01.999
I'm glad.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.127
But why settle for excellent
when we could be the best?

18:05.210 --> 18:08.046
With your help,
just imagine our potential.

18:08.547 --> 18:11.008
Oh, are those grapes?
I didn't order these.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.718
They're for a New Year's celebration

18:12.801 --> 18:14.511
known as "the 12 grapes of luck."

18:14.595 --> 18:16.346
I love the authenticity.

18:16.430 --> 18:20.934
It's one of our hotel's
annual traditions starting this year.

18:21.018 --> 18:23.562
The grapes represent
the 12 months of the year.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.690
Put one in your mouth each time
the bell tolls at midnight.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.526
If you eat them all,
your 12 wishes will come true.

18:32.905 --> 18:36.116
That reminds me,
I have a very special announcement.

18:40.454 --> 18:43.874
Here at Las Colinas,
we're more than colleagues.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.459
We're family.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.669
Which is why I'm delighted to announce

18:47.753 --> 18:50.756
this very special promotion
at the pool area.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.466
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:52.549 --> 18:57.429
please raise your glasses
to our new head of the pool department,

18:58.931 --> 19:02.267
Héctor Valero.

19:02.351 --> 19:05.187
Oh, my God.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.730
Diane, thank you.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.566
I'm so thrilled
I could kiss you right now.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.363
That's supposed to be my promotion.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.699
I earned it.
I did everything you said I should.

19:17.783 --> 19:20.327
Good things will come to you, Máximo.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.079
You must be patient.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.914
You didn't push for me, did you?

19:25.499 --> 19:26.917
I don't like your tone.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.795
We'll have a chat tomorrow.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.300
The better job had fallen through.

19:35.384 --> 19:36.468
Máximo.

19:36.552 --> 19:38.136
But with minutes to spare,

19:38.220 --> 19:41.098
at least I still might be
with the woman I loved.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.935
Will Julia González
please meet me up on the stage?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.186
Julia González.

19:53.026 --> 19:56.071
Come on, everybody. Give her a round.
Look at her. Isn't she beautiful?

20:03.745 --> 20:04.746
Julia…

20:06.707 --> 20:08.417
you are such an amazing woman,

20:08.500 --> 20:10.836
and I feel so grateful
to have you in my life.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.298
I'm at my best when I'm with you,

20:14.381 --> 20:17.009
and I can't imagine my life
without you in it.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.386
And I wanna make sure I never have to.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.685
I love you more than anything,

20:27.269 --> 20:29.605
always and forever.

20:37.154 --> 20:42.492
Julia González Padilla, will you marry me?

20:54.087 --> 20:56.006
She nodded! That means yes!

21:07.601 --> 21:10.312
I told you we're all family
at Las Colinas.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.022
But really, I couldn't be happier.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.442
And since our gift shop will soon
be carrying your line of dresses,

21:15.526 --> 21:19.947
that makes you my business partner
and my daughter.

21:22.241 --> 21:24.243
Oh, yes.

21:25.494 --> 21:28.622
And now, get those grapes ready

21:28.705 --> 21:33.126
because it's about to be 1985 in…

21:33.210 --> 21:36.046
Diane, we'd be honored
to invest in Las Colinas.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.214
30, 29, 28...

21:37.297 --> 21:38.465
The honor is mine.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.759
To many years of working together.

21:40.843 --> 21:42.010
You okay?

21:42.094 --> 21:43.846
Yeah. I'm fine.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.473
It was just such a surprise.

21:47.099 --> 21:52.563
I didn't want to say no to you in front of
an entire crowd of people, but…

21:53.438 --> 21:57.693
Maybe my answer will be yes,
but we need to talk about this more.

21:57.943 --> 21:59.278
Here come the grapes!

21:59.361 --> 22:01.363
13, 12...

22:01.488 --> 22:04.992
...eleven, ten, nine...

22:05.242 --> 22:07.536
I thought
we'd never get a chance to be alone.

22:07.870 --> 22:11.123
…six, five, four…

22:11.206 --> 22:15.127
three, two, one.

22:15.669 --> 22:18.130
Happy New Year!!!

22:27.055 --> 22:27.890
I have to go.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.945
Sounds like our next
big event here might be a wedding.

22:42.029 --> 22:44.031
Engagements are easy to break off.

22:44.114 --> 22:45.949
I've done it four times myself.

22:46.033 --> 22:49.286
Let's lock in our investors,
then we'll deal with all that.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.370
I see.

22:52.623 --> 22:56.126
Well, if you'll excuse me,
it's been a long day.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.545
I'm going to retire to my villa.

22:58.629 --> 23:01.882
Don Pablo, happy New Year.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.342
Happy New Year.

23:07.304 --> 23:09.264
Héctor, now that you're heading up
the pool department,

23:09.348 --> 23:11.308
there's lots to discuss. Walk with me.

23:12.851 --> 23:14.853
As bad as my night had been,

23:15.354 --> 23:17.940
it was about to get much worse.

23:31.537 --> 23:33.956
Suddenly, it all made sense to me.

23:34.456 --> 23:35.958
Enough with the flattery.

23:36.041 --> 23:39.044
It had all been happening
right under my nose.

23:46.385 --> 23:48.929
It turns out,
I never had a chance.

23:53.183 --> 23:57.145
Because he'd won the game
before I even knew I was playing.

23:59.690 --> 24:02.776
This entire resort was in on a joke,

24:03.652 --> 24:05.070
and I was the fool.

24:07.865 --> 24:08.866
Máximo.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.075
Finally!

24:10.242 --> 24:11.243
Can we talk?

24:12.244 --> 24:13.287
What else is there to say,

24:13.829 --> 24:14.705
but congratulations.

24:15.038 --> 24:15.622
I know.

24:15.956 --> 24:16.915
That was unexpected.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.293
I'm so confused...

24:19.376 --> 24:20.335
You don't need to explain anything to me.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.462
Everything is quite clear.

24:23.130 --> 24:26.049
Chad and you deserve to be together
without anyone getting in your way.

24:26.175 --> 24:26.925
But the other night--

24:27.009 --> 24:28.135
Don't worry about it.

24:28.594 --> 24:30.095
I won't say anything about it.

24:30.804 --> 24:32.222
You can rest assured.

24:33.098 --> 24:34.474
It was obviously a mistake.

24:35.601 --> 24:36.727
I wish you happiness.

24:36.810 --> 24:37.644
You deserve it.

24:38.437 --> 24:39.229
Happy New Year.

24:54.036 --> 24:54.953
Dad.

24:58.957 --> 25:00.501
I'd like you to meet your grandson,

25:02.169 --> 25:02.961
Mariano.

25:05.214 --> 25:06.173
Mariano.

25:07.299 --> 25:09.551
He did get to meet his grandson.

25:09.635 --> 25:10.844
He did.

25:11.470 --> 25:14.515
There were still
a few more surprises that night.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.361
1985 was less than two hours old…

26:10.612 --> 26:13.657
but already my life had changed
in a million ways.

26:15.742 --> 26:16.994
Héctor's victory.

26:20.247 --> 26:21.748
Julia's engagement.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.755
My fight with Don Pablo.

26:33.844 --> 26:35.971
But one friendship hadn't changed.

26:36.388 --> 26:37.347
Hey...

26:38.432 --> 26:39.933
Look at what I have for you.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.068
Happy New Year!

26:50.444 --> 26:51.695
Happy New Year!

26:58.952 --> 27:00.370
I'm sorry about Julia.

27:01.038 --> 27:02.164
And your promotion.

27:03.123 --> 27:05.959
What's there to do?

27:08.879 --> 27:10.964
When we first started working here,

27:12.049 --> 27:14.134
I thought everything was black and white.

27:15.177 --> 27:17.721
That there were good and bad people.

27:19.515 --> 27:21.141
But now,
it seems like the whole world is just...

27:22.643 --> 27:23.435
gray.

27:25.604 --> 27:28.398
You once told me
I should go where I'm wanted.

27:28.899 --> 27:30.359
Sounds like something I would say.

27:30.734 --> 27:31.944
Very wise.

27:32.736 --> 27:34.530
But if the world is truly gray,

27:34.780 --> 27:36.406
and people are only looking
after themselves,

27:36.740 --> 27:39.034
then maybe I should just go
where I want to go.

27:40.118 --> 27:41.703
I'm tired of being the fool.

27:42.996 --> 27:44.164
Well...

27:44.414 --> 27:45.874
I just tried that...

27:46.166 --> 27:47.501
and it might have been a mistake.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.338
Lupe saw me kiss Lorena.

27:51.505 --> 27:52.256
No way!

27:52.923 --> 27:54.383
You and Lorena kissed?

27:54.591 --> 27:56.134
That's awesome!

27:56.677 --> 28:00.264
But then I ran into Lupe, we talked and...

28:00.722 --> 28:04.101
she said some scary things about
how she is going to make my life hell.

28:04.351 --> 28:06.645
I really need to get out of
the laundry room.

28:07.771 --> 28:08.355
But...

28:11.984 --> 28:13.151
I got you...

28:13.652 --> 28:14.611
this.

28:15.654 --> 28:17.364
My dad's escapulario!

28:20.242 --> 28:21.326
What did you have to trade it for?

28:21.410 --> 28:23.912
The paper that Lorena
wrote her phone number on.

28:24.538 --> 28:25.289
But...

28:25.873 --> 28:26.874
I memorized it.

28:28.876 --> 28:30.127
Now that Hector's been promoted,

28:30.627 --> 28:32.129
there might be an opening at the pool.

28:32.754 --> 28:33.380
No way!

28:33.505 --> 28:34.047
Yes!

28:34.298 --> 28:36.758
Can you imagine us both working
at the pool every day?

28:37.176 --> 28:38.927
That's always been our dream.

28:40.137 --> 28:42.431
I have a feeling that 1985...

28:42.639 --> 28:44.183
will be a great year for both of us!

28:48.854 --> 28:52.357
And that's how the year
that really changed my life began.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.903
But I think that's enough for today.

28:56.445 --> 28:57.863
It's time for you to go home now.

28:58.488 --> 29:01.867
Tío, you need to go
to Don Pablo's memorial service.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.786
Máximo, Hugo's right.

29:05.287 --> 29:06.538
You need to go.

29:06.622 --> 29:08.916
I know you're afraid
of what you might face there,

29:08.999 --> 29:11.168
but think about Don Pablo and his son.

29:11.251 --> 29:13.003
It wasn't too late for him to make amends.

29:13.086 --> 29:15.047
It's not too late for you either.

29:18.258 --> 29:21.553
Fine. I'll go on one condition.

29:22.137 --> 29:23.430
Hugo needs to come with me.

29:24.348 --> 29:25.974
-Why?
-Protection.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.519
I might have to use him as a shield.

29:29.019 --> 29:30.145
What?

29:30.854 --> 29:33.148
Can I go, Mom? Please?

29:36.068 --> 29:37.444
-Yes.
-Yes!

29:37.528 --> 29:40.239
-Yay!
-Yeah!

29:40.322 --> 29:42.783
So, am I going to be able
to meet all these people

29:42.866 --> 29:44.368
you've been talking about all day?

29:44.451 --> 29:48.455
Memo and Héctor
and Lupe and all the others?

29:48.539 --> 29:49.957
I would assume so.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.501
And what are you gonna say
when you see Julia again?

29:53.001 --> 29:54.419
Oh, wait a second.

29:54.503 --> 29:56.588
Are Chad and Julia still married?

29:56.672 --> 29:58.799
We can discuss all this
in the private jet.

29:58.882 --> 30:00.759
Excuse me? Private jet?

30:00.843 --> 30:03.554
Don Pablo's memorial's in Mexico.

30:04.054 --> 30:06.974
This will be a good time
for you to stop the excuses

30:07.057 --> 30:09.101
and finally learn some Spanish.

30:09.184 --> 30:11.395
Sure thing, Uncle.
Sure thing!

30:13.146 --> 30:14.731
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.

30:14.815 --> 30:15.816
Happy birthday, m'hijo.

30:18.652 --> 30:19.862
I love you, Tío.

30:20.571 --> 30:23.866
Me too. A lot.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.286
I love you.

30:54.813 --> 30:57.566
I just don't know
what I'm going to do about Julia.

30:58.192 --> 31:00.068
Don't worry about it.

31:00.694 --> 31:02.779
You are Máximo Gallardo!

31:02.988 --> 31:05.532
You always find a way
to get what you want.

31:06.950 --> 31:07.993
I do, don't I?

31:09.077 --> 31:10.704
This is just the beginning.

31:11.997 --> 31:14.499
They better be ready because here we come!
