00:29.728 --> 00:30.348
Hmm.

00:31.026 --> 00:31.958
I must be supposed

00:31.959 --> 00:33.059
to remember something.

00:33.689 --> 00:34.501
Huh?

00:36.361 --> 00:37.310
Huh.

00:37.610 --> 00:38.434
Hmm.

00:38.660 --> 00:40.571
Come on, memory, wake up.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.816
Is it our anniversary?

00:44.815 --> 00:46.720
No, we don't have one this year.

00:46.930 --> 00:47.600
Hmm.

00:50.413 --> 00:51.960
Hm-hmm...

00:54.816 --> 00:56.108
Don't forge ?

00:56.199 --> 00:58.413
Don't forge what?

00:59.928 --> 01:01.310
Oh... don't forget.

01:01.318 --> 01:03.991
????????????  Don't forget what?

01:03.997 --> 01:04.733
Hustle your

01:04.738 --> 01:05.790
bustles, gang.

01:05.798 --> 01:06.912
We're going to the Senior

01:06.917 --> 01:08.872
Olympics to root for Grampa.

01:08.878 --> 01:10.770
The Senior Olympics?

01:10.776 --> 01:12.690
That's what I was supposed

01:12.705 --> 01:13.840
to remember?!

01:13.858 --> 01:14.763
Oh...

01:14.767 --> 01:16.382
Don't you dare go limp.

01:16.388 --> 01:18.963
Too late. The deed is done.

01:18.966 --> 01:20.590
Kids, grab a fold.

01:33.266 --> 01:34.082
Oh, hey, Homer.

01:34.088 --> 01:35.343
Uh, I hope you didn't forget

01:35.348 --> 01:37.010
that today's our big day.

01:37.016 --> 01:38.390
I sure am looking forward

01:38.397 --> 01:39.983
to my birthday fishing trip.

01:40.436 --> 01:41.712
Well, I'll see you soon.

01:41.718 --> 01:43.523
This is Moe, big day.

01:43.777 --> 01:45.133
Uh... waiting,

01:45.135 --> 01:47.163
feeling, uh, kind of fragile.

01:47.337 --> 01:48.991
Moe, the birthday boy,

01:48.997 --> 01:51.010
listening for your car.

01:56.138 --> 01:57.731
I can finally win

01:57.738 --> 01:58.782
a gold medal.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.770
I came close

01:59.775 --> 02:01.661
at the 1936 Olympics.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.670
I threw a javelin

02:10.676 --> 02:12.453
that barely missed Hitler.

02:14.578 --> 02:16.371
But I did hit an assassin

02:16.376 --> 02:18.473
who was trying to kill Hitler.

02:18.475 --> 02:19.161
What is this?

02:19.165 --> 02:20.332
Kill Hitler day?

02:21.086 --> 02:22.663
The next time I saw Hitler,

02:22.678 --> 02:23.451
we had dinner

02:23.455 --> 02:24.562
and laughed about it.

02:45.627 --> 02:46.862
What's with the lined

02:46.865 --> 02:48.423
composition book?

02:48.445 --> 02:50.183
My report on a "Fascinating

02:50.188 --> 02:51.940
Springfielder" is due Monday,

02:51.947 --> 02:53.120
and everybody I've tried

02:53.137 --> 02:55.250
to interview is so boring.

02:57.117 --> 02:58.362
You could interview me.

02:58.365 --> 03:00.093
I collect Absolut ads.

03:00.095 --> 03:01.672
How many others do you have?

03:02.448 --> 03:03.733
There are others?

03:07.038 --> 03:08.413
This guy sucks.

03:08.415 --> 03:09.673
He can barely make it

03:09.676 --> 03:10.483
to the top.

03:25.348 --> 03:27.863
72 lousy events

03:27.868 --> 03:30.273
and Grampa hasn't won
a single medal.

03:30.275 --> 03:31.201
Well, it's not fair

03:31.206 --> 03:32.191
when Moleman uses

03:32.197 --> 03:33.630
his replacement legs.

03:37.265 --> 03:38.802
On your mark!

03:48.148 --> 03:48.672
Oh...

03:48.976 --> 03:50.350
Oh, it's clouding up.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.813
I better put on me rain poncho.

03:58.465 --> 03:59.292
Sir!

03:59.296 --> 04:01.240
You dropped your munchers!

04:08.158 --> 04:09.710
You'll never take me alive,

04:09.717 --> 04:10.570
Grim Reaper

04:15.885 --> 04:17.519
Yay, Grampa.

04:19.088 --> 04:20.060
Take the boy.

04:20.065 --> 04:21.470
His soul is fresher.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.493
I've never been happier.

04:30.048 --> 04:32.282
Turn that hippie crap off!

04:34.365 --> 04:38.071
I wonder if the dog thought about us while we were gone.

04:40.426 --> 04:41.960
Oh... 

04:41.965 --> 04:45.053
I was supposed to take Moe fishing today.

04:45.065 --> 04:46.320
Everybody hide!

04:47.498 --> 04:50.473
Finally,that jerk Homer is home.

04:53.208 --> 04:55.183
Oh, it's just his car.

04:57.538 --> 05:00.071
Happy birthday to me

05:00.147 --> 05:02.971
Happy birthday to m e

05:02.975 --> 05:06.090
I feel so damn lonely

05:06.107 --> 05:08.943
Won't someone kill me...

05:12.366 --> 05:14.310
And many more.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.761
Homer, we can't scuttle like crabs

05:25.767 --> 05:27.490
for the rest of our lives.

05:27.498 --> 05:28.861
Says you.

05:48.518 --> 05:50.780
"Dear Pus Bag"?

05:51.496 --> 05:53.510
Whoa, Marge, who'd you piss off?

05:53.515 --> 05:55.490
It's for you, Pus Bag!

05:56.378 --> 05:58.370
Birthdays  never meant squat to me.

05:58.376 --> 06:00.070
 Then you offered to take me fishing,

06:00.076 --> 06:01.461
and like a stumblebum chump,

06:01.506 --> 06:02.681
 I dared to hope.

06:02.685 --> 06:04.190
But you shattered my dreams

06:04.208 --> 06:06.492
like a Duff tall boy in a bar brawl,

06:06.497 --> 06:09.941
and you jammed the jagged neck right up my heart's butt.

06:09.946 --> 06:12.302
 I guess I just wasn't meant to be happy 

06:12.308 --> 06:14.690
or handsome or anything, really.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.672
What a deep, tormented soul.

06:23.445 --> 06:24.751
L oser!

06:31.498 --> 06:32.462
Moe!

06:32.467 --> 06:36.402
You have a world view both bleak and beautiful.

06:36.407 --> 06:38.721
I want to write a report about you.

06:38.727 --> 06:40.522
Wow, for the first time in my life,

06:40.526 --> 06:42.183
someone's takinga genuine interest

06:42.186 --> 06:43.521
in what's inside of me.

06:43.658 --> 06:46.282
Heh, suddenly, this is my best birthday ever.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.323
Still in the top three.

06:57.688 --> 06:59.461
Still in the top ten.

07:02.775 --> 07:04.793
How come you wanna do a report on me?

07:04.795 --> 07:08.500
I ain't no great man, like Bob Seger or Haystacks Calhoun.

07:08.506 --> 07:12.280
Because I suspect deep within you is an artist's soul.

07:12.288 --> 07:14.060
Thanks. Say, here's my digs.

07:17.977 --> 07:20.321
Moe, you live in a hotel?

07:20.328 --> 07:21.890
You're just like "Eloise"!

07:21.898 --> 07:24.183
Did someone say my name?

07:24.795 --> 07:27.873
This vibrating massage chair feels great!

07:27.877 --> 07:30.631
That ain't a massage chair.It's just full of cockroaches.

07:31.286 --> 07:31.631
See?

07:32.745 --> 07:33.972
eyeball screams
broken pige 

07:35.246 --> 07:36.411
Liver fights kidney
who wins ? no one 

07:36.416 --> 07:37.261
Wow!

07:37.445 --> 07:40.152
Moe, these fragments are fascinating.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.712
"I was in the Christmas pageant once.

07:42.716 --> 07:45.152
"Mom showed up with a new boyfriend.

07:45.155 --> 07:46.862
He called me Steve."

07:46.966 --> 07:47.942
Oh... what you've got here is poetry!

07:48.316 --> 07:50.933
Oh... what you've got here is poetry!

07:50.936 --> 07:53.690
Ooh, Moe's a poet!

07:53.698 --> 07:55.583
He has a soul!

07:55.586 --> 07:56.831
Flutter your wings!

07:56.838 --> 07:59.611
It's tea time in Buttercup Junction!

07:59.617 --> 08:00.540
Dee-dee-dee... 

08:03.280 --> 08:06.150
Moe's the Princess of Lollipop Land!

08:07.043 --> 08:09.980
He lunches on lavender and potpourri!

08:12.986 --> 08:15.108
Seriously, Moe,I think you have a gift.

08:15.109 --> 08:17.410
Thanks, Homer.I love ya, man.

08:17.545 --> 08:19.992
Ooh, you love a man!

08:23.316 --> 08:26.520
You know, artfully arranged,these fragments could be

08:26.525 --> 08:31.033
an epic poem-- like T.S.Eliot's "The Wasteland."

08:31.036 --> 08:32.773
What-which why-liot's the who-now?

08:36.966 --> 08:38.053
Whoa!

08:38.054 --> 08:41.413
My brain-goo's comin' out all artistical, thanks to you.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.070
How 'bout this for a title:

08:43.077 --> 08:45.731
"Howling at a Concrete Moon."

08:45.738 --> 08:47.292
That's a terrific title!

08:47.295 --> 08:50.011
It jumps out at you like a ratin your underwear drawer.

08:50.018 --> 08:52.293
We make a great team there, Liser.

08:54.605 --> 08:57.811
"...my soul smells like a dead pigeon after three weeks.

08:57.816 --> 08:59.801
"I shut my window and go to sleep.

08:59.807 --> 09:00.923
In my dream 

09:00.996 --> 09:03.313
I eat corn with my eyes."

09:07.735 --> 09:08.843
Philistines.

09:10.665 --> 09:11.690
Lisa, I'm sorry you

09:11.698 --> 09:14.080
got a bad grade on your "Moe and tell."

09:14.095 --> 09:15.540
I don't care about my grade.

09:15.547 --> 09:18.873
I'm gonna send Moe's poem to American Poetry Perspectives.

09:18.876 --> 09:21.790
Do not mention that publication in this house!

09:21.796 --> 09:23.932
They never published my poem!"There once was a rapping tomato

09:26.688 --> 09:28.560
"That's  right,I said 'rapping tomato'

09:28.565 --> 09:30.950
"He rapped all day from April to May

09:31.216 --> 09:32.950
And also, guess what,it was me."

09:40.186 --> 09:42.160
Hey, Chief, we just got a submission

09:42.168 --> 09:44.260
from a brilliant poet no one's ever heard of!

09:46.895 --> 09:48.533
Hmm ! Genius !

09:48.547 --> 09:50.003
Pay him nothing,and run it on the cover!

09:50.685 --> 09:52.172
Stop the presses ! Send my wife some flowers!

09:52.175 --> 09:53.781
And bring me an Advil! What do you mean you don't work for me?!

09:53.788 --> 09:55.120
You're hired ! Now that you're hired, you're fired!

09:55.127 --> 09:56.370
Now that you don't work here, we can be friends.

09:56.375 --> 09:57.541
Now that we're friends,how come you never call?

09:57.546 --> 09:58.400
Some friend you are !

09:58.497 --> 09:59.702
God, I love this business.

09:59.707 --> 10:00.541
Here it is.

10:02.796 --> 10:04.513
Bad news, Maya Angelou : you've been bumped.

10:04.515 --> 10:06.051
...you can't bump me...

10:06.055 --> 10:07.641
...bump you!

10:11.905 --> 10:14.810
Moe, you're a published author!

10:14.817 --> 10:16.852
Wow, Just think : earlier tonight,

10:16.857 --> 10:20.021
a newly-published poet cleaned up my barf.

10:20.946 --> 10:21.980
Moe's Tavern. 

10:22.165 --> 10:22.851
Who ?

10:22.988 --> 10:23.501
Where ? 

10:23.746 --> 10:24.591
To what ?

10:24.786 --> 10:26.391
Screw you, snail trail!

10:26.467 --> 10:27.851
Who was that?

10:27.856 --> 10:29.700
Eh, some jerk makin'a prank call

10:29.706 --> 10:31.902
with a gag name:"Tom Wolfe."

10:31.968 --> 10:33.242
Tom Wolfe?!

10:33.246 --> 10:35.192
He wrote The Right Stuff

10:35.195 --> 10:37.223
and Bonfire of the Vanities.

10:37.226 --> 10:40.001
And coined the phrase "radical chic !"

10:41.155 --> 10:43.661
Wait, wait, wait. Then that guy wasn't squeezin' my 'roids

10:43.668 --> 10:46.812
when he invited me to the Wordloaf Festival in Vermont?

10:47.505 --> 10:49.061
The Wordloaf Festival?!

10:49.327 --> 10:51.923
You'll meet all the great American writers, Moe!

10:51.926 --> 10:53.140
You have to go!

10:53.146 --> 10:56.592
Yeah? Well, okay, all right,but uh... only if you come, huh?

10:56.598 --> 10:58.982
Ah, I wouldn't-a had none of this without you, kid.

11:01.526 --> 11:03.292
Hello. Oh, hey, Milhouse.

11:03.298 --> 11:04.372
I'm not here.

11:07.207 --> 11:10.300
Ah, a family trip with
the family bartender,

11:10.358 --> 11:11.500
what could be better?

11:13.257 --> 11:14.273
How's it goin', Homer ?

11:15.475 --> 11:18.951
I gotta go to Vermont
for some stupid poetry thing.

11:19.956 --> 11:22.002
Homer, don't drink and drive!

11:22.606 --> 11:25.572
Fine. I'll drive between sips.

11:45.595 --> 11:46.550
Whoop !

11:46.656 --> 11:49.052
They got an open bar
at this thing, right?

11:50.355 --> 11:53.483
Wow. Troopers from every
state in New England.

11:53.585 --> 11:54.953
Including Rhode Island !

11:55.058 --> 11:57.430
We're a small state,
but we give big tickets.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.250
Hey, guys, did ja hear?

11:59.295 --> 12:01.402
The Da Vinci Code just sold
one hundred million copies!

12:06.647 --> 12:07.781
It's Tom Wolfe!

12:07.887 --> 12:11.922
He uses more exclamation points
than any other major American writer.

12:11.928 --> 12:12.921
It's true !

12:13.028 --> 12:17.701
- How ya doin' there ? Moe Szyslak.
- Ah, magnificent Moe.

12:17.807 --> 12:20.803
He stands, stoop-shouldered,
blinking in the light,

12:20.906 --> 12:23.303
hollow-chested  like
a dough-faced fall guy

12:23.405 --> 12:26.323
who's made a career of
taking dives but has decided

12:26.427 --> 12:29.151
to  get his manhood out of
hockand take a shot at the title.

12:29.257 --> 12:31.631
or at least go for the jaw and thwack

12:31.805 --> 12:36.221
hyperextend the champ's pterygoideus
before kissing the mat good night.

12:39.457 --> 12:42.571
You ever scrub your hands real fast,
and you think you're seein' a third one?

12:42.675 --> 12:44.862
One time I looked down
and there really was.

12:45.368 --> 12:47.131
I gotta get a new lock
for that bathroom.

12:51.607 --> 12:56.431
Moe, your debut poem is as refreshing
as a second pair of socks on a wet hike.

12:56.636 --> 13:00.063
I must know how you came
up with that brilliant title,

13:00.166 --> 13:02.122
"Howling at a Concrete Moon."

13:03.806 --> 13:06.302
Uh, well actually, I had
some help on the title...

13:08.836 --> 13:10.792
You needed help to write your title?

13:10.996 --> 13:12.983
Well, so have I, Gore Vidal.

13:13.088 --> 13:17.072
1876 was the price
I paid for gas once.

13:17.176 --> 13:21.100
I thought of Burr when I saw it
written on an Eskimo Pie package.

13:21.106 --> 13:22.552
I can't believe it!

13:22.658 --> 13:24.002
Those sound like terrible jokes!

13:24.108 --> 13:28.203
Sir, I must ask you to pick up your
gift bag and leave this festival.

13:28.305 --> 13:31.083
I don't need your
sycophantic laughter!

13:31.185 --> 13:33.043
I have some on tape.

13:35.786 --> 13:41.720
You still love me, Temple
University Class of 1987.

13:44.307 --> 13:47.281
So Moe, you were telling us
how you came up with your title.

13:47.386 --> 13:49.801
Yeah, well, I-I was
just saying that um...

13:51.237 --> 13:53.271
...that I, uh, I thought
it up all by myself.

13:54.787 --> 13:58.023
Ah, like a real writer.
Outstanding, Moe!

13:58.126 --> 13:59.152
To the hayride!

14:00.958 --> 14:02.962
<i>Let's get it started</i>

14:03.166 --> 14:07.272
<i>Let's get it started in here,
let's get it started...</i>

14:08.955 --> 14:10.380
But we were a team!

14:10.885 --> 14:11.881
<i>Let's get it started...</i>

14:20.357 --> 14:21.733
I'd like to introduce our panel:

14:21.938 --> 14:25.112
Jonathan Franzen,
Michael Chabon and Moe.

14:25.515 --> 14:29.152
Whoa, clear water.
Swanky ! Woo-hoo.

14:29.258 --> 14:33.083
Now we'll open the floor to
fawning praise and obvious questions.

14:35.226 --> 14:36.260
Uh, yeah, first of all,

14:36.267 --> 14:38.331
I'd like to thank all of you
for your brilliant work.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.371
Yes, yes.

14:41.778 --> 14:44.482
My question is, who are
your biggest influences ?

14:44.488 --> 14:47.802
I'd have to say my good
friend Jonathan Franzen.

14:47.907 --> 14:50.701
I thought his novel The
Corrections needed none.

14:50.908 --> 14:53.290
Cha-bone.... !

14:53.305 --> 14:56.223
Well, in turn, I'd have to
say my biggest influence is...

14:56.796 --> 14:57.830
Albert Camus.

14:57.835 --> 15:00.611
You were supposed to say me.
I blurbed you.

15:00.716 --> 15:03.262
Yeah, and it looks real
sweet on my dust jacket.

15:03.367 --> 15:07.132
- How do you like me now?
- Fran-zone... !

15:07.438 --> 15:09.260
Moe, who inspired
you to become a writer?

15:09.265 --> 15:11.383
Jack Kerouac ? Charles Bukowski ?

15:11.686 --> 15:12.902
Me, Tom Wolfe ?

15:13.105 --> 15:15.103
Well, I dunno, uh...
the only book I ever read

15:15.206 --> 15:18.443
was Super Hounds :
The Ultimate Greyhound Betting System.

15:18.547 --> 15:21.303
So, uh, any of you
wetnaps write that?

15:24.706 --> 15:28.863
Mr. Szyslak, there must be some person,
possibly in this very room,

15:28.868 --> 15:31.343
who believed in you
when no one else did.

15:31.546 --> 15:34.542
Oh, uh, yeah,
I get what you're gettin' at.

15:34.945 --> 15:36.133
Um... nope.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.433
But how can you...?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.751
Now, now, he's
answered your question.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.002
I declare this panel dismissed.

15:42.007 --> 15:46.551
- But I deserve acknowledgement.
- I said dismissed.

15:47.208 --> 15:51.682
Lisa, grab your sightseeing shoes.
We're going Vermonting.

15:51.886 --> 15:53.552
It's gonna be awesome.

15:53.758 --> 15:57.071
Man, couples in this state
sure like to clink glasses.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.843
You guys go ahead.

15:59.847 --> 16:02.383
I don't think
I'd be very good company.

16:02.488 --> 16:04.003
Hey, thanks for the heads up.

16:04.008 --> 16:05.153
We'll see you
when we see you.

16:10.008 --> 16:12.163
I love these covered bridges.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.930
It's like driving through
cute little houses.

16:15.036 --> 16:17.483
That was my house, you moron.

16:19.468 --> 16:20.333
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:20.335 --> 16:22.501
We should exchange
insurance information.

16:22.706 --> 16:24.181
I have none.

16:37.206 --> 16:40.602
No food for you grad students
till you grade 3,000 papers.

16:43.276 --> 16:46.343
Hey, hey, there you are.
I've been lookin' for ya.

16:46.347 --> 16:49.113
I need a brilliant new poem
for the farewell dinner.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.402
So if you could turn
these into one of those

16:51.506 --> 16:53.682
and then don't say nothin' while
I take all the credit,

16:53.786 --> 16:56.300
I'd really appreciate it,
though I'd never admit that.

16:56.405 --> 16:57.571
And, look, I got you started.

16:58.057 --> 16:59.170
Huh ? Huh ?

16:59.375 --> 17:01.993
Moe, you're a heartless jerk.

17:03.107 --> 17:05.240
Huh? Whoa ,where did that come from?

17:05.345 --> 17:07.133
Oh, right, right, my actions.

17:07.536 --> 17:10.303
Well, let's see if I can
put this poem together.

17:13.306 --> 17:14.002
Hah!

17:15.308 --> 17:16.300
Hey, hey, hey.

17:16.406 --> 17:19.203
Hey, st... stupid geese,
you're eatin' my brilliance.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.800
Hey, hey,
I will break your beak.

17:22.906 --> 17:24.852
What... Get... Hey...
Look at me.

17:24.955 --> 17:26.833
It's supposed to be my big triumph,

17:26.935 --> 17:28.952
and I'm standing in mud,
fightin' with geese.

17:29.557 --> 17:31.932
Well, if I'm gonna fight,
I might as well win.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.852
Yeah, go on, you cowards.
Fly off in a "V".

17:41.135 --> 17:43.400
Hey, Lis, we learned so much
scootin' around Vermont.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.861
Did you know that candles
are made by losers?

17:46.067 --> 17:48.292
And we went to the
Vermont Teddy Bear factory.

17:49.006 --> 17:50.400
Look what we got.

17:57.008 --> 17:58.581
Oh, honey, don't cry.

17:58.688 --> 18:02.800
They're not made from real bears
just their fur and noses.

18:03.855 --> 18:07.522
Moe marginalized my contributions.

18:10.908 --> 18:13.920
No one makes my daughter sob and run.

18:14.028 --> 18:16.353
He ruined her first Wordloaf.

18:21.155 --> 18:23.302
Look at me, sittin' here
depressed when I'm surrounded

18:23.405 --> 18:25.953
by the happiest people
in the world: writers.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.252
Before Moe reads his keynote poem,
I would like to stake my claim

18:31.307 --> 18:33.651
to any unfinished
garlic mashed potatoes.

18:33.707 --> 18:36.951
So please, if you would pass
them clockwise up to table one,

18:37.058 --> 18:38.402
I will collect them later.

18:39.807 --> 18:42.301
Now, I give you Moe Szyslak.

18:46.005 --> 18:48.750
Uh, this here poem is
called "Elevator Capacity".

18:50.156 --> 18:52.901
"Elevator capacity : 2,400 pounds.

18:53.006 --> 18:57.002
"Inspection Certificate available
in hotel manager's office."

18:57.005 --> 19:00.750
You just pulled that off
the wall of the elevator.

19:00.955 --> 19:03.053
Yeah, well, uh, uh, here's
another one you might like.

19:04.255 --> 19:06.251
"Channel 61: Family Favorites.

19:06.358 --> 19:08.251
"Channel 62: Adult Desires.

19:08.558 --> 19:11.810
"Channel 63: In-Room Checkout.
Chan..."

19:19.688 --> 19:21.683
You know what ? 
I got a different poem for yaz.

19:24.085 --> 19:27.871
Ode to Lisa : 
Pointy-headed mini-muse

19:27.977 --> 19:32.050
More friend than I deserved
You pulled me from the dirt

19:32.055 --> 19:34.651
And made me the
beautiful flower that I am.

19:34.855 --> 19:37.153
But some flowers can
stab you in the back

19:37.155 --> 19:41.323
For which I should send you flowers
Which I will, but they were closed

19:41.425 --> 19:44.350
- You'll be getting them tomorrow.
- Oh, Moe.

19:44.356 --> 19:46.102
Lisa, if you could just forgive me,

19:46.208 --> 19:48.381
you would make me the
happiest man in Vermont.

19:48.586 --> 19:50.570
Except for those two
dudes I saw gettin' hitched.

19:50.677 --> 19:52.631
Not my thing,
but I wish 'em well.

19:52.938 --> 19:56.490
Make my daughter cry, will ya .
Eat syrup, jerk.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.473
- Wha... ?
- Dad, no!

19:58.676 --> 20:00.850
I'm not mad at Moe anymore.

20:02.055 --> 20:05.503
Uh, Homer, would it make you feel better
if, uh, any of that hit me?

20:05.608 --> 20:06.600
No, not now.

20:06.808 --> 20:08.621
I'm gonna walk away then. Okay ?

20:11.658 --> 20:13.932
Wow. You couldn't make this stuff up.

20:14.036 --> 20:16.550
- Well, you couldn't.
- That's it, Franzen.

20:16.657 --> 20:19.000
I  think your nose
needs some corrections.

20:25.156 --> 20:26.702
Ooh, you fight like Anne Rice.

20:29.105 --> 20:31.452
Well, Moe, I guess we're friends again.

20:31.557 --> 20:32.603
That's great.

20:32.708 --> 20:35.420
Now what do you say
we do some regional duck pin bowling?

20:35.605 --> 20:38.231
I'd like that.
I'd like it a lot.

20:40.787 --> 20:42.821
Aw, that's sweet.
I hate sweet.

20:43.027 --> 20:44.821
I need photos.
Photos of Spider-Man.

20:44.927 --> 20:48.151
- This is a poetry journal.
- Okay, then poems about Spider-Man.

20:48.156 --> 20:49.502
And I want them
finished before you start.

20:49.608 --> 20:50.853
And before you finish,
get me some coffee.

20:50.856 --> 20:52.782
And the poems should have
the following rhyme scheme:

20:52.868 --> 20:55.551
A-B-B-A-A-B-B-A-C-D-E-C-D-E.

20:55.556 --> 20:56.671
What are you waitin' for, Chinese New Year?

21:05.475 --> 21:09.841
Maple syrup
Sleigh on the label very good.

21:13.657 --> 21:16.723
Rich maple color, good swirl.

21:31.608 --> 21:33.100
Oh... Jemima!

21:34.627 --> 21:36.822
- Touched in the head, is he?
- A-yup.
