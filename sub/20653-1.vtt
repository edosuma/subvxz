02:10.423 --> 02:14.619
This is Captain Moretti to Unit 5.
Pick up Brannigan.

02:14.719 --> 02:17.705
Use a forklift if you have to,
but get him.

02:18.473 --> 02:21.793
APB on Lieutenant James Brannigan.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.197
Knock knock.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.742
Breaking and entering
is against the law, Brannigan.

02:53.842 --> 02:56.619
I rang. You didn't answer.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.830
I was working.

02:58.930 --> 03:01.166
Doing your own engraving now?

03:01.266 --> 03:05.127
Hey, wouldn't know old Abe
without his mole.

03:06.479 --> 03:08.214
Where's Larkin?

03:12.360 --> 03:15.346
No serial number, no prints,
can't be traced.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.683
Nobody'll know who dumped you.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.519
I don't spook, Brannigan.

03:21.619 --> 03:22.687
Oh, all right.

03:24.163 --> 03:26.024
The government wants Larkin for taxes.

03:26.124 --> 03:29.612
The Chicago Police
want him for extortion.

03:29.712 --> 03:31.780
Cut out the dedicated cop act.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.157
Everybody in this town
knows you want Larkin.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.201
And the grand jury finally indicts him

03:36.301 --> 03:38.119
and he disappears like a short beer.

03:38.219 --> 03:41.080
I'll give you five seconds
to tell me where.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.623
You count.

03:47.478 --> 03:50.924
Hey, wait a minute, wait, okay.
He left town.

03:51.024 --> 03:53.051
- How?
- I don't know.

03:53.151 --> 03:54.844
- Where?
- I don't know.

03:54.944 --> 03:58.139
No, wait a minute, I don't know.
You got to believe me.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.267
All right, cool it.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.980
You must be getting old, Angell.

04:06.080 --> 04:10.443
Trying to push second-rate
paper like this.

04:10.543 --> 04:13.613
Manny, this is Warehouse 17,
Polk Street,

04:13.713 --> 04:15.073
I got a paperhanger.

04:15.173 --> 04:16.950
Turn around, big man.

04:17.050 --> 04:19.452
Angell, you're a real bush leaguer.

04:19.552 --> 04:20.577
Yeah.

04:21.721 --> 04:24.541
You know something,
I don't think it's loaded.

04:24.641 --> 04:28.253
You dirty, lousy Mick, you got no rules.

04:28.353 --> 04:29.920
You got no...

04:32.106 --> 04:33.591
Are you all right?

04:35.693 --> 04:37.345
Are you all right, Jim?

04:38.363 --> 04:40.056
Now listen, Jim, Moretti's steaming.

04:40.156 --> 04:42.600
He's got the whole Chicago PD
looking for you.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.102
Nice to be wanted.

04:44.202 --> 04:47.272
You're wanted, all right.
There's an APB out on you.

04:47.372 --> 04:51.901
Listen, Brannigan, you're dead.
There's a contract out on you.

04:53.878 --> 04:56.322
Try explaining that
to your parole officer.

04:56.422 --> 04:59.742
Larkin's put up 25 Gs
to get you knocked off.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.661
You're gonna be walking down the street,

05:01.761 --> 05:03.997
or sleeping, or sitting on the can,

05:04.097 --> 05:06.082
and the next minute, Brannigan,

05:06.182 --> 05:09.418
you are dead! You lousy Mick, you!

05:24.409 --> 05:25.602
Brannigan.

05:25.702 --> 05:28.605
He's on the inside, far end of 17.

05:28.705 --> 05:31.065
Not him.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.650
Who?

05:33.167 --> 05:34.568
You.

05:34.752 --> 05:37.405
The Captain wants to see you. Now.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.992
You got a warrant?

05:41.092 --> 05:44.537
I don't need a warrant, Jim.
You're a public menace.

05:44.637 --> 05:47.165
- All right.
- Get in.

05:47.265 --> 05:48.499
It's my car.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.501
Joe will bring your car.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.258
Careful with the paint job.

06:50.703 --> 06:56.567
British Airways Flight 570,
nonstop 747 to London,

06:56.667 --> 07:00.070
will depart from the B Concourse.

07:01.172 --> 07:03.324
Well, you made it.

07:04.092 --> 07:07.078
All right, Captain, you going someplace?

07:07.178 --> 07:10.832
No, Lieutenant. You are.

07:10.932 --> 07:12.416
I am?

07:17.313 --> 07:19.090
What is this, Moretti?

07:19.190 --> 07:22.760
Passport, airline ticket
and $500 expenses.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.138
I packed a bag for you.

07:25.238 --> 07:26.764
That is my bag.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.057
I put everything in that was clean.

07:28.157 --> 07:29.934
Here, don't catch a cold.

07:31.536 --> 07:34.272
Moretti, you're gonna make somebody
a nice little wife.

07:34.372 --> 07:35.440
I'm doing you a favor, Jim.

07:35.540 --> 07:37.274
Yeah?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.695
Ben Larkin got out of town
a couple of days ago.

07:40.795 --> 07:41.779
I know that.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.948
He's in London. Scotland Yard's got him.

07:44.048 --> 07:46.742
- London?
- You got extradition papers.

07:46.968 --> 07:48.202
Miss Allen.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.954
I thought you might like
to bring him back

07:50.054 --> 07:51.914
and personally kick him in a cell.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.708
Miss Allen,
this is Lieutenant Brannigan.

07:53.808 --> 07:55.543
- Hi.
- She'll find a seat for you.

07:55.643 --> 07:56.836
All right.

07:56.936 --> 07:58.796
Just follow me, Lieutenant.

07:59.355 --> 08:01.006
Anywhere.

09:13.262 --> 09:14.872
Nice day.

09:16.641 --> 09:18.042
Want to walk, Mel?

09:18.142 --> 09:20.711
All right, you're on.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.894
By the right.

09:40.498 --> 09:42.316
Keep up, there.

09:47.046 --> 09:49.907
First order of business.
Call off the wolves.

09:50.007 --> 09:53.077
Even the elevator man looks like
he's from Scotland Yard.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.454
It may not be as simple as that.

09:55.972 --> 09:57.498
What broke loose?

09:59.016 --> 10:01.169
The word was in the street, Ben.

10:01.269 --> 10:03.796
Somebody talked, somebody listened.

10:05.106 --> 10:07.091
Chicago is sending Jim Brannigan over

10:07.191 --> 10:09.802
with extradition papers and handcuffs.

10:10.945 --> 10:12.930
He'll be at Heathrow anytime now.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.892
I told you I wanted
that big Irish bastard wasted.

10:15.992 --> 10:17.976
It's being taken care of, Ben.

10:19.203 --> 10:21.439
That won't help
your extradition problem.

10:21.539 --> 10:23.399
There'll only be a dozen Chicago cops

10:23.499 --> 10:25.318
on the next flight with more papers.

10:25.418 --> 10:28.196
Well, I'm not running. I like this town.

10:28.296 --> 10:30.823
I like the women, the clubs, the action.
I always did.

10:30.923 --> 10:34.660
Ben, please.
Listen to what I worked out.

10:36.304 --> 10:38.205
Now, in Devon,

10:38.306 --> 10:41.792
at an airport nobody's used for years,

10:41.892 --> 10:43.836
I've got a pilot
who'll take you to Ireland,

10:43.936 --> 10:47.173
where you'll skip immigration
and customs.

10:47.273 --> 10:50.885
Then you head on south
to Ecuador, Venezuela.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.970
Oh, that's just great.

10:53.362 --> 10:56.682
I end up eating bananas,
listening to my arteries harden.

10:56.782 --> 11:00.144
Ben, I'm talking to you as your lawyer.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.147
Your friend. Not a tour guide.

11:04.415 --> 11:08.235
The Cook County grand jury
can't touch you down there.

11:11.797 --> 11:17.036
Look, the boys will take care of you.
They have to.

11:17.136 --> 11:19.705
They've got more skeletons
than most graveyards.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.541
And you know what closets
they're hanging in.

11:22.641 --> 11:25.336
Fields, we didn't build
this organization

11:25.436 --> 11:29.047
by running from grand juries
just to save our hides.

11:29.357 --> 11:31.967
- We stick together.
- That's what I'm saying.

11:32.943 --> 11:35.263
To the boys, you're still number one.

11:35.363 --> 11:37.681
They'll see that you live like a king.

11:38.074 --> 11:40.559
They'll use me as a conduit.

11:40.743 --> 11:43.479
I'll funnel the cash to Switzerland,

11:43.579 --> 11:45.189
launder it in Panama,

11:45.289 --> 11:48.526
and ship it to you
by bank drafts or letters of credit,

11:48.626 --> 11:49.860
whichever you prefer.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.113
That's good. That's good.

11:54.632 --> 11:56.409
You know, Mel,

11:56.509 --> 11:59.036
those bananas will taste
a hell of a lot better

11:59.136 --> 12:02.164
when I know Brannigan's
lying in some gutter.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.333
It's done.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.085
- Who you got?
- Gorman.

12:07.353 --> 12:08.629
We used him before.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.548
Good. He's a pro.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.844
Enough of the walking. Let's ride.

12:43.305 --> 12:46.917
British Airways Flight number BA 570

12:47.017 --> 12:51.004
from Chicago now arriving
at gate number 2.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.257
Is Flight 570 in yet?

12:53.357 --> 12:55.676
Yes, it's just arrived.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.762
Could you make the announcement, then?

12:57.862 --> 12:59.763
Yes.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.267
Have a nice stay.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.602
Thank you.

13:04.702 --> 13:06.520
Would Mr. James Brannigan,

13:06.620 --> 13:08.856
British Airways passenger from Chicago,

13:08.956 --> 13:11.942
please report to the British Airways
information desk.

13:12.209 --> 13:15.779
James Brannigan to British Airways
information desk, please.

13:16.255 --> 13:20.075
How long are you expecting
to be with us, Mr. Gorman?

13:24.638 --> 13:26.082
Mr. Gorman?

13:26.182 --> 13:28.041
Oh, sorry. A week.

13:28.726 --> 13:30.878
Business or pleasure, sir?

13:31.353 --> 13:32.963
Strictly pleasure.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.135
Air India Flight number Al620

13:38.235 --> 13:42.681
for Bombay and Tokyo
now boarding at gate number 8.

13:48.746 --> 13:50.147
Lieutenant Brannigan?

13:50.247 --> 13:52.733
Yes. How did you know?

13:52.833 --> 13:57.071
Headquarters told me to look for someone
slightly smaller than the Statue of Liberty.

13:57.171 --> 14:00.533
Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher, sir,
Scotland Yard.

14:00.633 --> 14:03.702
They've made some real improvements
since I was last here.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.830
Thank you. This way, sir.

14:05.930 --> 14:07.831
Where's my man?

14:08.265 --> 14:09.834
The prisoner, Ben Larkin.

14:09.934 --> 14:12.795
Oh, Commander Swann
is handling the extradition.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.673
And the return-ticket reservations?

14:15.773 --> 14:17.341
Sir Charles has taken care of that.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.510
He's expecting you
for lunch at his club, sir.

14:19.610 --> 14:23.597
Sir Charles. Sir Charles.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.150
I've been assigned
as your driver, Lieutenant.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.569
And to generally take care of you
while you're here.

14:36.669 --> 14:38.154
To keep an eye on me, you mean.

14:38.254 --> 14:41.990
Well, not quite. It's more of a PR job.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.661
Anyway, it'll make a nice change
from the Vice Squad.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.166
- Okay, sir.
- Right.

15:37.479 --> 15:41.591
Mel, I'm the one
that's going to take the heat.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.303
Now, nothing can screw up.

15:44.403 --> 15:46.305
Stay cool, Ben.

15:46.405 --> 15:49.099
It's ticking like a Swiss watch.

15:55.706 --> 15:58.108
- Morning, Mr. Larkin.
- Good to see you, Jules.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.627
- Morning, Ben.
- Morning, boys.

16:25.402 --> 16:28.096
Get me a box
at the dog races tonight, Gates.

16:29.365 --> 16:32.684
Oh, yeah. Call Jimmy the Bet.

16:33.077 --> 16:36.980
And tell him to put
£400 on Triple Cross.

16:37.623 --> 16:40.067
Ready when you are, Mr. Larkin.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.651
Good.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.533
You've been to England before, sir?

16:49.009 --> 16:52.329
That's right, Miss Thatcher,
during the war.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.999
Well, I expect you'll find London's
changed quite a bit.

16:55.099 --> 16:58.668
But it's basically the same,
still a very beautiful city.

16:59.144 --> 17:02.006
If there are any places
you'd like to revisit, any pubs or any...

17:02.106 --> 17:04.842
Right now, what I'd like is
about eight hours of sleep,

17:04.942 --> 17:07.844
a shower and a change of clothes.

17:08.028 --> 17:11.015
And to get my hands in Larkin's lapels.

17:11.115 --> 17:12.516
Yes, sir.

17:15.077 --> 17:18.021
I sound like a bear cub
with a toothache, it's just...

17:18.122 --> 17:21.817
I understand, sir.
My father flew with the RAF.

17:23.544 --> 17:26.405
He said there were only three things
wrong with the Yanks.

17:26.505 --> 17:27.531
Yeah?

17:27.631 --> 17:31.326
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.704
I really walked into that one.

17:34.930 --> 17:37.374
And deserved it. I'm sorry.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.835
Might we start again, sir.

17:40.144 --> 17:42.879
Why? We're doing fine.

17:45.816 --> 17:48.469
I was just thinking,
can I call you Jenny?

17:48.569 --> 17:50.303
Of course.

17:51.447 --> 17:54.308
Boy, I knew a great gal named Jenny.

17:57.578 --> 18:00.313
She used to lend me money
when I was broke.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.985
Did she contribute
any other philanthropies?

18:07.504 --> 18:11.575
We were friends. Good friends.

18:15.471 --> 18:17.581
Damn good friends.

19:11.068 --> 19:13.803
- Right, Mr. Larkin.
- Hello, hello, hello.

19:17.074 --> 19:20.060
Lie down facing this way.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.437
- All right.
- And relax.

19:27.501 --> 19:30.987
Excuse me, Jackson,
I've got a steam bath out there.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.657
Well, the pool's down there,
but you'll have to go outside.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.159
I'll show you the way.
It's right around the back.

19:59.616 --> 20:02.352
Excuse me, Tom, there's a delivery.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.980
What? I don't know anything
about a delivery.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.732
- Neither do I.
- It's a rush order.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.234
Where should we drop it?

20:09.334 --> 20:11.861
Better put it out there.
Through the open door.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.741
Grand Central Station.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.749
Hey, muscles.

20:23.849 --> 20:26.835
It's a bit tight here.
Can you give us a hand?

20:27.102 --> 20:29.004
Excuse me a moment, Mr. Larkin.

20:34.818 --> 20:35.969
Now, what's all this?

21:04.681 --> 21:06.458
That's great.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.753
You like that, do you?

21:31.083 --> 21:33.151
How do you like that?

22:26.430 --> 22:28.164
Morning, sir.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.201
Here we are, sir. The Garrick Club.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.384
See you later, sir.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.344
Aren't you joining us?

23:22.444 --> 23:25.055
If I walked in there,
I'd cause a dozen heart attacks.

23:25.155 --> 23:28.684
It's a men's club.
Rules strictly enforced.

23:28.784 --> 23:30.351
Too bad.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.733
Sir?

23:36.833 --> 23:40.529
Brannigan. Jim Brannigan
to see Commander Swann.

23:40.629 --> 23:42.531
Yes, sir. That'd be Sir Charles.

23:42.631 --> 23:44.991
He's in the lounge bar upstairs.

23:45.675 --> 23:46.910
Thank you.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.912
Begging your pardon, sir.

23:49.346 --> 23:52.582
I'm sorry, Mr. Brannigan,
it's a club rule.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.752
Fine.

23:56.186 --> 23:58.796
Strictly enforced, I presume.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.286
...and that was the last I saw of her.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.460
Excuse me.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.338
- Lieutenant Brannigan?
- Right.

24:40.438 --> 24:43.091
Charles Swann. Pleasant flight?

24:43.316 --> 24:44.551
Just long.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.470
Would you like a glass of sherry, then?

24:46.570 --> 24:49.764
Well, actually, I'd like a boilermaker.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.602
That's a whiskey neat,
you'd say, and a beer chaser.

24:53.702 --> 24:55.979
- Cold, if you can find it.
- Certainly, sir.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.689
I think we can manage that.

24:57.789 --> 24:59.983
A good old Polish drink.

25:00.083 --> 25:02.318
Now, where do we pick up this Larkin?

25:02.794 --> 25:04.946
Well, he's under surveillance.

25:05.046 --> 25:06.573
Surveillance?

25:06.673 --> 25:08.533
You come to the States for a prisoner,

25:08.633 --> 25:11.661
and we'd have him standing by
handcuffed at the airport.

25:11.761 --> 25:15.040
Yes, but you see,
under our judicial system,

25:15.140 --> 25:17.751
Mr. Larkin has the right
to apply for bail.

25:17.851 --> 25:20.837
Well, unfortunately,
we have the same law.

25:20.937 --> 25:22.714
That's how we lost him.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.883
Rather careless, wasn't it?

25:24.983 --> 25:28.470
I think you can rest assured
that won't happen here.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.263
Spot of lunch?

25:30.363 --> 25:31.848
Why not?

25:33.867 --> 25:36.019
Then we'll pick up your friend Larkin.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.360
Should I call you Sir Charles?

25:43.460 --> 25:45.529
Oh, I think Swann
will do nicely, thank you.

25:45.629 --> 25:48.657
I only use the Sir for theater tickets
and table reservations.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.658
May I lead the way?

25:51.134 --> 25:52.410
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.830
Actually, the title
is a military courtesy

25:54.930 --> 25:57.374
granted to one of my ancient ancestors.

25:57.474 --> 26:00.335
Probably for holding somebody's
horse at a coronation.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.587
- How's this?
- Thank you.

26:02.771 --> 26:04.131
No castles or booty?

26:04.231 --> 26:06.049
No, I'm afraid not.

26:06.149 --> 26:09.010
But every Maundy Thursday,
for some totally unaccountable reason,

26:09.110 --> 26:10.637
I'm granted the inestimable privilege...

26:10.737 --> 26:12.264
- Morning, Barker.
- Morning, Sir Charles.

26:12.364 --> 26:15.058
...of dropping a sprig of myrtle
in the River Thames at Westminster.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.270
The Dover sole is excellent.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.313
Thank you very much. Dover sole?

26:20.413 --> 26:22.357
Commander, it's my breakfast time.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.818
I'd sure like two over easy,

26:24.918 --> 26:27.612
some bacon crisp and a short stack.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.282
Right. I think what my guest
would like is

26:30.382 --> 26:32.701
two eggs lightly fried on either side,

26:32.801 --> 26:36.705
a couple of rashers of bacon
and a modest portion of pancakes.

26:36.805 --> 26:38.456
Not too modest on the pancakes.

26:38.556 --> 26:40.458
- Right, sir.
- And Dover sole for me, please.

26:40.558 --> 26:41.959
Thank you, sir.

26:42.519 --> 26:46.422
Lieutenant, you shouldn't be wearing
that particular item.

26:47.399 --> 26:50.927
Well, a fellow at the front desk said
I had to put it on.

26:51.027 --> 26:55.431
Not the tie,
the .38 caliber Colt Diamondback.

26:59.828 --> 27:02.647
Commander, I always wear this.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.734
Well, I'm afraid it's placing you
in violation of

27:05.834 --> 27:08.444
British law
and Scotland Yard regulations.

27:09.045 --> 27:12.741
Well, it isn't in violation
of United States law,

27:12.841 --> 27:15.952
and I work under the Chicago
Police Department regulations,

27:16.052 --> 27:18.287
which makes it obligatory.

27:19.014 --> 27:22.834
Then I strongly urge you to resist
any temptation to use it.

27:25.937 --> 27:28.881
Well, I don't think
I'll be needing it in here.

27:29.399 --> 27:31.426
Excuse me, Sir Charles.

27:31.526 --> 27:33.553
Gentleman to see you at the door.

27:35.405 --> 27:36.889
Excuse me.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.330
Barker.

28:00.430 --> 28:04.000
Bring the Lieutenant a whiskey
and a beer chaser, will you.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.085
You mean a boilermaker, sir.

28:07.145 --> 28:09.130
Make it two.

28:11.316 --> 28:12.717
What for?

28:13.526 --> 28:16.179
Mr. Larkin has been kidnapped.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.604
It can't happen here, huh?

28:30.919 --> 28:33.738
Well, cheer up.

28:34.464 --> 28:36.991
All we can lose is our jobs.

30:04.387 --> 30:07.707
- Oh! Gorman?
- Yeah.

30:15.064 --> 30:17.258
A friend of mine said
you had a package for me.

30:17.358 --> 30:21.470
Two questions. From where and for what?

30:21.613 --> 30:23.750
From Chicago, to hit something.

30:24.250 --> 30:26.016
Right on, bucko.

30:33.875 --> 30:36.152
Half now, and half at ice time.

30:37.545 --> 30:38.780
When he's on ice, you mean.

31:02.654 --> 31:03.763
It's a bit light.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.932
It's just my usual commission.

31:08.409 --> 31:11.287
Off their end. Not mine.
Don't be difficult, friend.

31:11.387 --> 31:15.474
Why don't you stay awhile
and talk to Luana?

32:00.044 --> 32:02.321
Nice and gentle, love, I'm not kinky.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.157
You are what you're paid to be.

32:17.478 --> 32:21.132
This is all that Larkin left behind
at the athletic club.

32:21.232 --> 32:23.593
We don't know that Larkin
was really snatched.

32:23.693 --> 32:25.428
Of course not.

32:25.528 --> 32:28.556
But we do still have
that masseur unconscious in hospital.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.767
That's might be just an act.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.685
At this particular point
I don't think that's

32:32.785 --> 32:35.188
an assumption the Yard
can afford to make.

32:35.288 --> 32:37.607
Well, if it was up to me,
I'd get some men out

32:37.707 --> 32:41.236
thumping on the streets,
passing out some e pluribus unum.

32:41.336 --> 32:44.488
That's what 90% of police work is today.

32:45.048 --> 32:47.158
The murder rate
in your country, I'm sure,

32:47.258 --> 32:50.870
gives ample testimony
to your superior police methods.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.582
Well, Commander, I didn't come over here
to argue police methods.

32:54.682 --> 32:57.585
But a certain Ben Larkin is missing.

32:57.769 --> 33:01.005
And I intend to use
my best efforts to find him.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.883
Without interfering
with the Yard, of course.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.343
Oh, Lieutenant.

33:06.819 --> 33:08.763
I am still a little concerned

33:08.863 --> 33:11.766
about a certain item you're wearing.

33:11.908 --> 33:15.186
Oh, well if that bothers you,

33:15.870 --> 33:17.688
wear it in good health.

33:18.581 --> 33:20.524
The old school tie.

33:27.965 --> 33:31.077
Well, guv, what do you think
of our friend Brannigan?

33:32.553 --> 33:37.291
Well, he's an American.

33:50.780 --> 33:52.056
Sir Charles.

33:52.156 --> 33:56.412
Why would a bona fide lord
want to be a cop?

33:56.512 --> 33:58.979
Because he's good at it.
Why are you a cop?

33:59.330 --> 34:01.566
I don't know. Runs in the family.

34:01.666 --> 34:03.693
But it stops right here.

34:03.793 --> 34:05.361
My son is a lawyer.

34:07.964 --> 34:11.283
Hello, Central? Central 77 here.

34:12.677 --> 34:14.871
Mollie? Do me a favor, will you?

34:14.971 --> 34:17.456
Call Richard and tell him I'll be late.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.876
I don't know. About 7:00. Thanks.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.379
Monkey wrench?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.172
You mean a spanner?

34:27.150 --> 34:29.217
Did I throw one in your social life?

34:29.717 --> 34:31.721
Well, not quite.

34:31.821 --> 34:35.056
Not that Richard is exactly
a paragon of patience.

34:35.824 --> 34:39.353
Well, just blame it
on your Yankee slave driver,

34:39.454 --> 34:41.481
who still hasn't eaten.

34:41.581 --> 34:44.525
Would you mind grabbing a bite
before we go house hunting?

34:44.625 --> 34:46.527
I wouldn't mind at all.

35:30.463 --> 35:31.739
Thank you very much.

35:31.839 --> 35:34.117
Lieutenant, I'll see you in the morning.

35:34.217 --> 35:37.620
- Maybe around nine?
- About that, goodnight.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.548
Mr. Lawyer, the next voice your hear

37:12.648 --> 37:16.510
belongs to Ben Larkin.
You'd better listen.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.848
Fields, I've been grabbed
by a couple of hoods.

37:20.948 --> 37:22.433
They're tough.

37:22.533 --> 37:25.519
So you do exactly what I tell you,
or I'm a dead man.

37:25.661 --> 37:28.064
Now, you've got five envelopes
with this tape.

37:28.164 --> 37:32.276
First, put £50,000 in each envelope.
Get old, used bills.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.403
Then you make the drop in person.

37:34.503 --> 37:37.240
Come alone to the mailbox
in the middle of Piccadilly Circus

37:37.340 --> 37:40.284
at exactly 11:35 a.m. tomorrow morning.

37:40.384 --> 37:42.203
You got that?

37:42.303 --> 37:45.581
Next, stay away
from those damn limey cops.

37:45.681 --> 37:48.084
They could screw things up.

37:48.184 --> 37:49.961
There's a gun at my head, Fields,

37:50.061 --> 37:51.920
so don't blow this one.

37:52.188 --> 37:55.299
Or my guys will tear your heart out.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.639
Why did you double-cross him, Fields?

38:03.282 --> 38:04.475
What does that mean?

38:04.575 --> 38:07.228
Larkin told you to stay away
from the cops.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.730
In Chicago, I would have.

38:10.081 --> 38:12.358
But considering the reputation
of Scotland Yard,

38:12.458 --> 38:15.444
I decided it was
in the best interests of my client

38:15.544 --> 38:17.863
to put the matter in their hands.

38:19.256 --> 38:22.243
You're a real Eagle Scout, Fields.

38:22.343 --> 38:25.538
We don't even know
that that's Larkin's voice.

38:25.638 --> 38:30.001
Inspector, Mr. Larkin called in
to complain about our surveillance, sir.

38:30.101 --> 38:32.458
The call was routed
routinely through Central

38:32.558 --> 38:35.881
where it was in turn re-directed
to the switchboard of our department.

38:36.565 --> 38:38.467
In rather sulfurous language,
I must say,

38:38.567 --> 38:39.886
Mr. Larkin demanded...

38:39.986 --> 38:41.887
Yes, thank you, Mike, thank you.

38:41.988 --> 38:46.309
The point is, we taped Larkin's call,
voiceprinted it.

38:46.409 --> 38:48.143
They matched.

38:50.579 --> 38:54.775
Do you think you can raise
that money by tomorrow morning?

38:54.875 --> 38:56.652
That's no problem.

38:56.752 --> 39:01.365
Fortunately, Mr. Larkin has generous
and influential associates in the States.

39:01.465 --> 39:04.326
Translation, Commander, hoods.

39:04.927 --> 39:06.829
A bank draft is on its way.

39:06.929 --> 39:11.667
Mob money, squeezed out of hookers
and skimmed off of casinos.

39:12.143 --> 39:15.838
Yes, well, I think we perhaps
better get on with it, Mr. Fields.

39:16.564 --> 39:19.299
Commander, what will you be doing?

39:19.692 --> 39:23.220
Well, our interests are mutual.
The safe return of Mr. Larkin.

39:23.779 --> 39:25.597
We'll keep you informed.

40:36.852 --> 40:38.629
It's a bit dicey.

40:39.355 --> 40:41.256
Not a copper in sight.

40:44.068 --> 40:47.596
They're down there, all right.
I can smell them.

41:07.883 --> 41:09.993
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

42:37.306 --> 42:39.750
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.

42:39.850 --> 42:42.210
Rolls-Royce approaching the circus.

43:54.216 --> 43:55.868
Drop completed.

43:55.968 --> 43:57.869
Prepare for pickup phase.

44:11.108 --> 44:13.051
Well, now we'll see.

44:57.696 --> 45:01.266
Mailman's just passed me.
Approaching the island now.

46:10.227 --> 46:12.087
It's too damn simple.

46:14.648 --> 46:16.091
Pickup completed.

46:16.191 --> 46:18.134
Right, job completed. Let's go.

46:32.374 --> 46:34.025
We'll take it.

50:31.571 --> 50:34.141
It's a messenger on a motor scooter.
We're on him.

50:34.241 --> 50:35.975
Right. Get going!

50:48.714 --> 50:52.158
- Like I said.
- Too damn simple.

50:52.801 --> 50:56.037
That's right. Too damn simple.

51:06.940 --> 51:08.716
Don't get too far behind.

52:13.548 --> 52:15.909
Give Harry a hand, there.

52:36.613 --> 52:38.514
Hold it!

52:41.076 --> 52:42.894
Can you swim?

52:43.370 --> 52:44.938
- Yeah.
- Go get it!

52:55.090 --> 52:57.659
I'll sink with these boots on!

52:59.344 --> 53:01.162
Oy, give us a hand.

53:02.764 --> 53:04.958
After a few questions.

53:09.646 --> 53:12.173
What's the idea of throwing
this money in the river?

53:12.607 --> 53:13.717
Money?

53:13.817 --> 53:15.969
I don't know nothing about no money.

53:16.069 --> 53:20.348
Some bloke mailed the instructions,
with a five-pound note.

53:32.878 --> 53:34.529
Newspaper.

53:34.629 --> 53:36.030
What?

53:36.131 --> 53:38.366
They pulled a Murphy.

53:38.675 --> 53:41.036
Hey, what about me?

53:41.136 --> 53:43.037
A Murphy?

53:57.611 --> 53:59.012
Okay.

54:11.374 --> 54:14.068
Yeah, they tunneled from underneath.

54:14.794 --> 54:19.241
Yes, of course. And then they switched
envelopes by means of...

54:19.341 --> 54:21.367
A false bottom.

54:27.599 --> 54:29.500
As simple as that.

54:30.018 --> 54:31.794
A magnet.

54:36.441 --> 54:39.927
Ruddy sewers.
They'll be miles away by now.

55:09.849 --> 55:11.918
I'll be right back.

55:31.204 --> 55:33.398
Hello, Mrs. Cooper.

55:33.498 --> 55:36.025
Good afternoon, Mr. Brannigan.

55:37.085 --> 55:38.445
Would you like a coffee?

55:38.545 --> 55:42.115
Oh, thank you, no.
Some people are waiting for me.

55:42.215 --> 55:44.158
Oh, pity.

56:59.167 --> 57:01.235
Oh, Mrs. Cooper.

57:01.711 --> 57:03.738
Yes, Mr. Brannigan?

57:03.880 --> 57:06.241
Did I have any visitors today?

57:06.341 --> 57:08.410
No, I don't think so.

57:08.510 --> 57:10.119
Thank you.

57:10.762 --> 57:16.209
Oh, there was a man here.
Something about the central heating.

58:04.732 --> 58:06.217
What happened?

58:06.442 --> 58:08.845
Your central heating friend
left me a present.

58:08.945 --> 58:11.305
- We must call the police.
- He is the police.

58:12.240 --> 58:14.934
I have never seen anything
like it in my life.

58:40.935 --> 58:43.170
- You're insured?
- Oh, yes, I am.

58:46.816 --> 58:49.218
- Jim?
- In here.

59:01.789 --> 59:03.608
What are you doing?

59:03.708 --> 59:06.444
Well, I'm afraid that the...
I'll show you.

59:10.840 --> 59:12.492
You mean he's put another one in there?

59:12.592 --> 59:14.243
I mean...

59:16.971 --> 59:19.457
- That's what I mean.
- Yes.

59:28.608 --> 59:30.009
Yeah.

59:31.569 --> 59:35.389
Larkin paid 25 grand
to get me that view.

59:45.333 --> 59:48.069
- All the usual checks being made?
- Yes, sir.

59:49.955 --> 59:51.573
All been fingerprinted, guv.

59:51.673 --> 59:53.950
I want a complete report
on all sales of gelignite

59:54.050 --> 59:55.743
- during the past two months.
- Right, guv.

59:55.843 --> 59:58.746
And try and trace that damn thing.

59:58.972 --> 01:00:02.166
- Where is he?
- He's downstairs at Mrs. Cooper's, sir.

01:00:04.102 --> 01:00:06.254
Oh, don't you look nice.

01:00:06.354 --> 01:00:07.380
Well, thank you.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.257
I'm sorry I haven't a room available,

01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:11.301
but I'm sure I could make room
for you in my place.

01:00:11.401 --> 01:00:12.927
Oh, that's very kind of you, but...

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.637
- No, really, it'd be a pleasure.
- Lieutenant.

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:18.349
Jennifer, don't you think we ought to show
our visitor a bit of British hospitality?

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.351
Why don't you take him out
for a spot of dinner?

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:21.436
Yes, sir.

01:00:21.536 --> 01:00:24.814
Oh, that's very kind of you.
And leave the police work to the Yard.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.442
Thank you very much, Mrs. Cooper.

01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:29.777
Oh, yes, Mrs. Cooper, thank you.

01:00:32.714 --> 01:00:34.573
Enjoy yourself, Lieutenant.

01:00:34.841 --> 01:00:36.409
I will.

01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:44.166
Perhaps you'd care
for a cup of coffee. Come along.

01:00:45.226 --> 01:00:46.794
Well.

01:01:02.535 --> 01:01:04.729
It says For Sale.

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:07.273
Well, I'm sure I can persuade them
to rent it to you for a week.

01:01:07.373 --> 01:01:08.608
If you don't mind me as a neighbor.

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:11.902
Why should I?
It puts me closer to my driver.

01:01:25.767 --> 01:01:27.168
It's been a lovely evening, Jim.

01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:29.504
Yeah, pleasant.

01:01:29.604 --> 01:01:32.173
And I hate to change the mood.

01:01:32.273 --> 01:01:34.884
But, Jenny, I want you to do me a favor.

01:01:34.984 --> 01:01:37.178
You shouldn't have that, Jim.
That's a felony.

01:01:37.278 --> 01:01:39.514
- Is that so?
- Yes, that is so.

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:41.516
Commander Swann was not amused.

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:44.269
I had all these names run down
by the Department.

01:01:44.369 --> 01:01:46.812
They all check out except that one.

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:50.275
- Jimmy the Bet.
- That's right, do you know him?

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:53.778
Yeah, he's a bookie. He's also a grass.

01:01:53.878 --> 01:01:57.573
What you would call a stoolie.
He's got his eye on every keyhole in London.

01:01:57.673 --> 01:01:59.450
Is it important?

01:01:59.634 --> 01:02:03.162
Anything that has to do
with Larkin is important.

01:02:03.346 --> 01:02:07.625
He's in blackmail, extortion, hard drugs.
You name it, he's in it.

01:02:10.812 --> 01:02:14.673
Jenny, I just happen to be working
the other side of the street.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.926
Is that all?

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:23.724
Well, a couple of years ago,
I was making it tough for him.

01:02:24.617 --> 01:02:29.396
And one night he hit back.
Pair of shotguns.

01:02:30.706 --> 01:02:32.859
But he obviously missed.

01:02:32.959 --> 01:02:37.571
But the rookie riding with me
took a blast in his face.

01:02:38.548 --> 01:02:43.035
He left a widow
and a couple of nice kids.

01:02:44.303 --> 01:02:46.247
I'm sorry, Jim.

01:02:46.347 --> 01:02:48.249
You must have been close to him.

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:52.503
Oh, it'd make a good story,
but that's not the reason.

01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:57.132
The truth is, I hated his guts.
He didn't like me.

01:02:57.525 --> 01:03:01.262
He had a degree in criminology and...
Well, to hell with that.

01:03:01.821 --> 01:03:05.308
My job was to keep him alive
until he could

01:03:05.408 --> 01:03:08.978
get smart enough or tough enough
to take care of himself.

01:03:11.372 --> 01:03:12.398
I blew it.

01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:19.989
What's that for?

01:03:20.465 --> 01:03:22.324
I don't know.

01:03:22.717 --> 01:03:25.911
You're just so damn solid.

01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:28.414
Fat, you mean.

01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:32.960
- Telephone for you, sir.
- Thank you.

01:03:33.394 --> 01:03:34.795
Hello?

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:40.676
Yes, Inspector. Yes, right away.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.306
He wants us back at the office.

01:03:54.415 --> 01:03:57.192
Yes, well, there's no doubt
this fingerprint is Larkin's.

01:03:59.128 --> 01:04:03.232
Oh, forgive me for interrupting
your evening, Lieutenant.

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:06.828
Jenny, the artist has a sketch
of our mad bomber up in 194.

01:04:06.928 --> 01:04:09.163
- Pick it up for me, will you?
- Yes, sir.

01:04:11.766 --> 01:04:15.378
Your theory that Mr. Larkin
may have staged his own kidnapping

01:04:15.478 --> 01:04:16.504
doesn't quite work.

01:04:16.604 --> 01:04:17.630
Is that so?

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:21.300
Someone sent us
a personal contribution from Mr. Larkin.

01:04:22.527 --> 01:04:24.678
Did you print it?

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.348
Of course.

01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:30.267
Third finger of the left hand.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:37.399
And it was accompanied by a demand
for an additional 350,000 quid.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:40.945
That brings the ante up to
a million and a half dollars.

01:04:41.045 --> 01:04:44.031
The additional payment
was in the nature of a penalty

01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:47.452
because Mr. Fields consulted
the Yard for assistance.

01:04:47.552 --> 01:04:50.037
- These gentlemen play rough.
- And smart.

01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:53.165
They certainly made bloody fools of us
in that Piccadilly caper.

01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:57.670
All my years in the Yard, I've never
received a finger in the morning post.

01:04:58.062 --> 01:05:00.381
God knows what they'll be
sending us next. On, thanks.

01:05:00.481 --> 01:05:01.716
Well, that's it.

01:05:01.816 --> 01:05:04.385
It's only based on your landlady's
description, of course.

01:05:04.485 --> 01:05:08.222
But we've wired copies to Interpol,
the Sûreté and the FBI.

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:09.724
Does it ring a bell for you?

01:05:09.824 --> 01:05:13.686
No, but if Larkin has a contract on me,
he'd hire top talent.

01:05:13.786 --> 01:05:16.314
Then I want you
on the next flight to Chicago.

01:05:16.414 --> 01:05:19.692
You care, Commander, you really care.

01:05:20.668 --> 01:05:24.363
I want you in Chicago alive,
you big sod.

01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:27.700
I don't want you in London
as an unsolved homicide.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.035
We're short-staffed as it is.

01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:31.954
We have the same problem
in Chicago, Commander.

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:33.914
Goodnight.

01:05:34.015 --> 01:05:35.416
Goodnight.

01:05:36.017 --> 01:05:38.210
Oh, Lieutenant.

01:05:40.605 --> 01:05:42.590
I'll take that particular item.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:44.466
You mean the...

01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:48.387
The notepad.

01:05:50.906 --> 01:05:55.602
I guess I picked this up by mistake.

01:05:55.828 --> 01:05:58.522
Of course. That's what I assumed.

01:06:03.252 --> 01:06:05.446
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:16.791
Listen, darling, I've got a problem.
I've got to stay on duty till 2:00.

01:06:16.891 --> 01:06:19.418
Well, here comes my problem.

01:06:19.894 --> 01:06:22.547
Oh, Jim, this is my fiancé,
Richard Nelson.

01:06:22.647 --> 01:06:23.965
- Jim Brannigan.
- Oh, how are you?

01:06:24.065 --> 01:06:25.841
So, you're the guy
who's been ruining our love life.

01:06:27.193 --> 01:06:28.928
I'm glad you're not 20 years younger.

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:31.597
If I were, you'd have to worry.

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:36.143
Well, we're not finished yet.
One more call. Sorry.

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:39.146
- Goodnight, love.
- Goodnight.

01:06:44.627 --> 01:06:47.529
Okay, where to?

01:06:47.755 --> 01:06:48.823
Jimmy the Bet.

01:06:48.923 --> 01:06:52.117
Oh, you watch him.
He's a tough customer.

01:07:09.527 --> 01:07:11.470
- Evening, Jimmy.
- I've got no time for bird cops.

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:13.180
I got £1,000 on this fight.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.183
Jimmy, it isn't social, it's official.
Open up.

01:07:19.412 --> 01:07:23.107
It still isn't social. I'm a cop.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.567
It shows, flatfoot.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:28.529
And I found your name on a notepad
of Benny Larkin's.

01:07:28.629 --> 01:07:29.947
Is he one of your customers?

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:33.575
I got nothing to say to you. Out!

01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:36.621
Benny Larkin's been kidnapped.

01:07:36.721 --> 01:07:38.748
You're gonna give me some information.

01:07:38.848 --> 01:07:42.209
I can ask questions easy,
or I can ask them hard.

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:44.211
Which will it be?

01:07:44.311 --> 01:07:47.089
This is what I answer questions with.

01:07:47.189 --> 01:07:48.758
It's mighty persuasive.

01:07:48.858 --> 01:07:52.427
I guess the questions can wait.
But not for long.

01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:03.397
Now, would you like to try
for England's free dental care,

01:08:03.497 --> 01:08:05.733
or are you gonna answer my questions?

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:08.026
I'll ask you just once.

01:08:09.545 --> 01:08:11.947
- Name a name.
- Al Drexel.

01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:15.284
- Did you hear another?
- No, I swear it.

01:08:16.343 --> 01:08:18.078
Where can I find this Drexel?

01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:21.332
A pub, he goes there, the Lamb Tavern.

01:08:21.432 --> 01:08:23.125
He goes there midday.

01:08:24.518 --> 01:08:26.252
Well, thanks, Jimmy.

01:08:26.854 --> 01:08:30.506
You know something,
that Jackson's a bum.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:33.760
He won't make it through the eighth.

01:08:45.206 --> 01:08:46.939
Any trouble?

01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:51.987
No trouble. Little hard
to understand his accent.

01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:13.300
That's Scotch rump steak, sir.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.219
Right, well, I'll have that one, please.

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:18.973
I don't mind this turning
into a shopping tour

01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:21.183
as long as it ends up with Drexel.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.981
I say. Talk of the devil.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:32.111
That's him in the gray suit,
walking towards the pub now.

01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:36.365
Fine, would you just give me time
to get a little friendly.

01:09:59.446 --> 01:10:01.515
Mind if I butt in, partner?

01:10:01.615 --> 01:10:02.641
It's a free country.

01:10:02.741 --> 01:10:04.142
- All right, Navy?
- Yes, sure.

01:10:04.577 --> 01:10:06.228
Yeah, it's a pleasant country.

01:10:06.328 --> 01:10:07.521
I wouldn't argue with that.

01:10:07.621 --> 01:10:11.192
Last time I was here, people were
getting bombed a different way.

01:10:19.633 --> 01:10:21.786
Doris, let's have some service here.
The man's dying of thirst.

01:10:21.886 --> 01:10:23.662
All right, darling, what do you want?

01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:25.039
Well, I want some Guinness.
How about you?

01:10:25.139 --> 01:10:26.874
- Same again, please.
- Good.

01:10:26.974 --> 01:10:28.876
- Navy?
- No, I've got enough, thanks.

01:10:28.976 --> 01:10:30.711
How is the second-best Navy?

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:32.463
- You should know.
- Nice one, Ted.

01:10:34.023 --> 01:10:37.467
Well, partner. Cheers.

01:10:39.987 --> 01:10:42.681
Wait a minute, friend,
we're having a drink.

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:45.935
Drexel, I'd like a few words with you.
Let's step outside, shall we?

01:10:46.035 --> 01:10:47.895
Scotland Yard. Can't you smell it?

01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:49.605
Is it illegal to have a drink?

01:10:49.705 --> 01:10:51.774
May I suggest, sir,
that you keep out of this.

01:10:51.874 --> 01:10:53.526
This is strictly police business.

01:10:53.626 --> 01:10:56.237
Oh, tell him to show you his badge.

01:10:56.337 --> 01:10:58.906
Drexel, I said outside. Now come on.

01:10:59.006 --> 01:11:00.699
That cuts it!

01:11:05.888 --> 01:11:07.248
Sorry.

01:11:09.642 --> 01:11:11.418
Hey, what are you doing?

01:11:18.484 --> 01:11:19.844
What's the idea?

01:11:19.944 --> 01:11:21.678
Well, who the hell started it?

01:11:24.865 --> 01:11:26.600
Awfully sorry.

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:38.945
And I love you so

01:11:39.964 --> 01:11:43.450
Let the sun shine

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:47.287
Let the sunshine in

01:11:51.225 --> 01:11:54.461
Let the sun shine

01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:58.465
Let the sunshine in

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:16.583
Guv.

01:12:27.803 --> 01:12:29.204
Guv!

01:12:29.471 --> 01:12:30.997
Mike, have you got it?

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:32.374
Seems likely, guv.

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:35.794
Gwendolyn Rooke.
Female, Caucasian, aged 26.

01:12:37.563 --> 01:12:39.048
Well, get on with it then.

01:12:39.148 --> 01:12:41.299
The subject resides in Balham.

01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:43.886
I'm sorry, lady. If I were you, I'd...

01:12:43.986 --> 01:12:45.679
Look out!

01:12:51.618 --> 01:12:53.604
And has access to blueprints and charts

01:12:53.704 --> 01:12:56.148
for telephone and sewage conduits...

01:12:58.751 --> 01:13:00.527
...under Piccadilly Circus.

01:13:04.173 --> 01:13:06.533
This place is getting kinda unfriendly.

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:09.536
- You're right.
- Where are we going?

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:12.080
Let's go to my place and have a drink.

01:13:19.772 --> 01:13:21.214
You all right?

01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:24.176
Come on, partner.

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:26.428
We'd better get out of here.

01:13:38.499 --> 01:13:39.900
The Yank's got our pigeon.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.443
As far as I can see.

01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:01.922
Yes, well, perhaps
we'd better look her over.

01:14:02.731 --> 01:14:04.425
See what Miss Rooke
has to say for herself.

01:14:04.525 --> 01:14:07.928
Oh, and, Mike, while you're at it,

01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:09.930
run this lot of rowdies in, will you.

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:11.515
Right, guv.

01:14:13.075 --> 01:14:15.227
Excuse me. How's your wrist?

01:14:36.314 --> 01:14:38.125
Constable. Arrest that lot, will you.

01:14:38.225 --> 01:14:40.210
Come on, sir. Come on.

01:14:42.146 --> 01:14:43.630
It had nothing to do with me.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:45.924
I'm only here for the beer.

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:50.971
I think you'll find the evidence
is conclusive, sir,

01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:52.014
if you would just examine the map.

01:14:52.114 --> 01:14:54.224
Yes, of course. Thank you.

01:14:55.909 --> 01:14:57.769
Thanks, Mike.

01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:03.817
Last month,

01:15:06.753 --> 01:15:08.363
the 16th, to be exact,

01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:10.282
you made copies of maps

01:15:10.382 --> 01:15:14.953
detailing the electrical and sewage conduits
beneath Piccadilly Circus.

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:17.039
That's what I'm paid to do, sir.

01:15:17.139 --> 01:15:18.832
Of course.

01:15:18.932 --> 01:15:21.043
But to whom did you give those copies?

01:15:21.143 --> 01:15:23.336
To one of my supervisors, I expect.

01:15:24.688 --> 01:15:29.342
Miss Rooke, both you and I know
that that is not true.

01:15:33.989 --> 01:15:37.810
Protecting a criminal, Miss Rooke,
is a crime in itself.

01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:43.398
And I suggest that in your own
best interests you stop lying to me.

01:15:51.048 --> 01:15:53.200
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't upset yourself.

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.660
Miss Rooke.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.453
I've always been a good girl, sir.

01:15:56.553 --> 01:16:00.248
I'm sure you have, my dear.
But to whom did you give them?

01:16:02.643 --> 01:16:05.462
To my boyfriend, Freddy.

01:16:08.482 --> 01:16:09.883
Freddy.

01:16:11.276 --> 01:16:12.786
Now, now, come on.

01:16:13.463 --> 01:16:14.596
Watch it, partner.

01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:17.182
- I'm only just...
- You're a handful.

01:16:20.494 --> 01:16:23.438
I like Americans. They think big.

01:16:24.498 --> 01:16:27.109
Wait till you see what I've got here.
Take a look at this.

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:28.360
Look at what?

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:32.238
I've got a deal going here
that'll make your hair stand on end.

01:16:34.967 --> 01:16:39.079
Oh, no, you're getting too familiar.
I've only just met you.

01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:41.373
We're only acquaintances yet.

01:16:41.473 --> 01:16:44.501
Well, you know what I think
you need, fella, is a cup of coffee.

01:16:44.601 --> 01:16:46.044
- I need another drink.
- Come on.

01:16:46.144 --> 01:16:47.921
- I can't stand coffee.
- Get in the kitchen.

01:16:48.021 --> 01:16:51.216
Come on, let's have a fight, Marquis
of Queensberry rules. Let's have a drink.

01:16:58.198 --> 01:17:00.392
Give me a minute
and I'll fix you right up,

01:17:00.492 --> 01:17:02.728
- if I can find the coffee.
- I don't want any coffee.

01:17:02.828 --> 01:17:05.814
Maybe you'll have to settle for tea.

01:17:56.548 --> 01:18:00.994
All right, Buster,
the friendly hour's over. Wake up.

01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:07.333
Come on, get up.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.634
Hold it up, down there!

01:18:34.294 --> 01:18:36.696
Get off, you stupid-looking mutt.

01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:39.240
Sorry!

01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:44.204
Police, son. Follow that car.

01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:47.373
What? Police? What car?

01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:50.711
- Right-hand drive.
- Of course.

01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:52.378
Well...

01:19:16.837 --> 01:19:18.113
I say...

01:19:18.213 --> 01:19:21.783
This is actually a new car, you know.

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:26.329
It's not really supposed
to go beyond 4,000 revs.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.128
Till the 1,000-mile inspection.

01:19:37.524 --> 01:19:38.967
Please look out!

01:19:41.778 --> 01:19:45.932
I was rather hoping to keep it
for a year or so, I...

01:19:49.035 --> 01:19:53.106
I wonder if I might get you
a taxi or something.

01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:39.485
Hang on.

01:20:46.676 --> 01:20:49.746
- I feel sick.
- Not in here!

01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:32.038
Oh, nuts!

01:21:33.974 --> 01:21:36.125
Oh, no!

01:22:04.838 --> 01:22:06.573
I waited a year for delivery.

01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:18.876
Very good. Thank you.

01:22:20.228 --> 01:22:26.426
Well, Lieutenant, how did you enjoy
your sightseeing tour?

01:22:26.651 --> 01:22:28.887
The view from the bridge was terrific.

01:22:28.987 --> 01:22:31.431
Incidentally, regarding that automobile,

01:22:31.531 --> 01:22:33.725
where would you liked it shipped?

01:22:34.454 --> 01:22:36.477
Well, you bought it, you know.

01:22:47.213 --> 01:22:49.074
Ooh, handsome.

01:22:49.174 --> 01:22:50.575
Freddy!

01:22:56.181 --> 01:22:58.041
- Yes, Mike?
- Nothing, guv.

01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:08.593
It's not fair. My eyes are murdering me,
looking at all those bloody pictures.

01:23:09.235 --> 01:23:10.845
You'll smoke when I tell you.

01:23:10.945 --> 01:23:12.514
Listen, I know my rights.

01:23:12.614 --> 01:23:15.183
You start talking to me about rights,

01:23:15.283 --> 01:23:18.478
and I'll tear you limb from limb.

01:23:18.578 --> 01:23:20.730
Now, who did you sell those plans to?

01:23:22.248 --> 01:23:24.442
I don't know what the bloody hell
you're talking about, man.

01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:27.361
Poor, ignorant, wee laddie, isn't he?

01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:29.990
They do have libraries inside, Freddy,

01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:33.827
and I'll put you away for so long,
you'll come out a bloody PhD!

01:23:40.392 --> 01:23:41.793
Swann.

01:23:42.185 --> 01:23:44.838
I'd tell that fellow
what he wants to know.

01:23:44.938 --> 01:23:47.132
He likes to hurt people.

01:23:47.232 --> 01:23:50.259
Today at a bar, there was a fight.

01:23:50.819 --> 01:23:53.179
He bit a fellow's ear off.

01:23:53.279 --> 01:23:54.347
Him?

01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:56.265
And that's not all.

01:23:59.994 --> 01:24:01.729
What, him?

01:24:03.707 --> 01:24:07.652
We'll be in touch. No more calls.

01:24:08.503 --> 01:24:11.906
Look, I've really had you, you creep.

01:24:12.006 --> 01:24:13.407
Okay.

01:24:14.551 --> 01:24:15.952
Okay.

01:24:16.636 --> 01:24:18.246
He gave me £100 to sell him the plans.

01:24:18.346 --> 01:24:20.373
- Who did?
- Charlie.

01:24:20.974 --> 01:24:23.042
Charlie Kane.

01:24:24.144 --> 01:24:25.920
Put him up.

01:24:29.232 --> 01:24:30.425
That's him. That's Charlie.

01:24:30.525 --> 01:24:31.635
- Take him away.
- All right, come on.

01:24:31.735 --> 01:24:35.680
And that's our man,
that's the fellow that nailed Drexel.

01:24:35.989 --> 01:24:37.849
- Are you sure?
- I saw him.

01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:41.227
Boy, oh boy,
it's really coming together.

01:24:41.327 --> 01:24:43.813
That was Fields. His friends
are calling at 11:00 tomorrow

01:24:43.913 --> 01:24:46.232
with instructions for the next payment.

01:24:46.416 --> 01:24:48.276
Give us time
to put a tracer on the call?

01:24:48.376 --> 01:24:51.821
I wish we could.
They're calling on a marine frequency.

01:24:51.921 --> 01:24:53.656
They ain't amateurs.

01:26:59.799 --> 01:27:01.701
Hello, Jim. Where are you going?

01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:04.370
Have you got the keys to your car?
I forgot my notebook.

01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:05.872
Sure, I'll get it.

01:27:05.972 --> 01:27:08.958
No, you'll get your hair wet.

01:27:13.104 --> 01:27:14.880
You wanna bet?

01:28:51.077 --> 01:28:53.062
Jenny, look out!

01:29:24.777 --> 01:29:27.513
Jenny! You all right?

01:29:29.615 --> 01:29:30.850
Are you all right?

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:33.185
- No.
- What's the matter?

01:29:33.286 --> 01:29:34.979
Well, look at my hat.

01:29:35.079 --> 01:29:38.190
Oh, your hat.

01:29:40.209 --> 01:29:42.278
Let's get out of this.

01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:45.656
Yes, sir.

01:29:47.508 --> 01:29:50.244
Damn it, I'm having to take more flak

01:29:50.344 --> 01:29:54.082
than an air gunner over Normandy
on this case. Forget the Commissioner.

01:29:54.182 --> 01:29:56.084
Now, we've got the Home Secretary

01:29:56.184 --> 01:30:00.254
blowing his top, demanding to know
what kind of a lunatic I've turned loose.

01:30:00.354 --> 01:30:02.090
This isn't Chicago, you know, Brannigan.

01:30:02.190 --> 01:30:03.800
That's right, Commander.

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:06.469
You can't buy a decent hamburger
anyplace around here.

01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:07.679
You're a bloody magnet for trouble.

01:30:07.779 --> 01:30:11.182
First the man hired to kill you
blows up an apartment,

01:30:11.282 --> 01:30:14.978
and then you demolish an automobile
in what must be one of the most

01:30:15.078 --> 01:30:17.772
brazen, reckless stunts
in the annals of this city.

01:30:17.872 --> 01:30:18.982
Look, Commander...

01:30:19.082 --> 01:30:20.692
And then, last night,
you turn a perfectly peaceful

01:30:20.792 --> 01:30:22.527
London street into a shooting gallery.

01:30:22.627 --> 01:30:24.529
And if I hadn't done some shooting,

01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:26.864
Jenny would be lying
on a marble slab right now.

01:30:26.964 --> 01:30:29.867
Exactly. Simply because she
was mistaken for you.

01:30:29.967 --> 01:30:32.912
I've asked you politely.
Now I'll ask you impolitely,

01:30:33.012 --> 01:30:34.580
give me that gun.

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.081
I haven't got it.

01:30:41.479 --> 01:30:42.964
Well?

01:30:43.064 --> 01:30:46.300
This just arrived
from the FBI in Washington, DC, guv.

01:30:46.651 --> 01:30:47.969
You got a name for him?

01:30:48.069 --> 01:30:51.222
Name of John Gorman.
An habitué of New Orleans, Louisiana.

01:30:51.322 --> 01:30:52.932
- Last known address...
- Do you know him?

01:30:53.032 --> 01:30:54.726
Well, I know about him.

01:30:54.826 --> 01:30:57.437
The word is that he's a stud
who won't quit.

01:30:57.537 --> 01:31:00.398
Well, we'll pick him up. Send out
a top-priority signal to all stations.

01:31:00.498 --> 01:31:01.482
Right away, sir.

01:31:04.544 --> 01:31:05.945
Yes?

01:31:09.882 --> 01:31:12.535
Joseph Brannigan, long distance.

01:31:14.387 --> 01:31:15.788
Hello?

01:31:16.722 --> 01:31:20.459
Hello, big stuff. Sure, fine.

01:31:20.893 --> 01:31:22.170
You did?

01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:23.879
Well, what's the dope?

01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:27.759
Well, now let me get this straight, now.

01:31:27.859 --> 01:31:30.010
Jupiter Equity Fund.

01:31:30.319 --> 01:31:36.141
He bought 20,000 shares at $49,
sold them at $3.

01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:40.855
That makes Melvin a living,
breathing pauper.

01:31:40.955 --> 01:31:43.399
Sure, I will. Be home soon.

01:31:44.333 --> 01:31:45.734
Your son?

01:31:46.419 --> 01:31:47.779
What's his line of work?

01:31:47.879 --> 01:31:49.113
Ballet.

01:31:49.213 --> 01:31:50.490
I should have guessed.

01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:54.202
No, he's Assistant
District Attorney for Cook County.

01:31:54.302 --> 01:31:57.329
Anything in that conversation
I should know about?

01:31:57.889 --> 01:32:00.666
Commander, I wish it were Christmas.

01:32:00.766 --> 01:32:03.794
Have I got some
kind of a present for you.

01:32:26.792 --> 01:32:29.820
Yes. Right, thank you.

01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:32.657
Mr. Fields is on his way up, sir.

01:32:32.757 --> 01:32:34.408
Do you know where he's parked?

01:32:34.508 --> 01:32:36.785
- Nine, lower level.
- Right.

01:32:44.644 --> 01:32:46.129
Excuse me.

01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:47.880
Sorry.

01:32:49.190 --> 01:32:51.425
Got to the bank at the stroke of 10:00,

01:32:51.525 --> 01:32:55.721
and it took eight clerks
until now to get this package together.

01:32:56.447 --> 01:32:58.850
We were worried about you, Melvin.

01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:00.893
Make yourself right at home, Brannigan.

01:33:00.993 --> 01:33:02.645
I have.

01:33:03.663 --> 01:33:07.566
We're now ready and willing
to make the payment.

01:33:11.671 --> 01:33:15.407
Mr. Fields,
we have some new information.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:20.412
And we are now very close to a breakthrough
in this case. Very close.

01:33:23.849 --> 01:33:26.919
Within four hours, or five, at the most,

01:33:27.019 --> 01:33:30.089
we expect to have Mr. Larkin home safe.

01:33:31.857 --> 01:33:34.385
I strongly suggest, therefore, that,

01:33:34.485 --> 01:33:36.429
in the best interests of your client,

01:33:36.529 --> 01:33:39.765
you delay payment for those few hours.

01:33:40.032 --> 01:33:41.601
No way.

01:33:41.701 --> 01:33:44.770
This time I do exactly
what they tell me.

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:50.901
You pay that money now,
and you'll get Larkin back in chunks.

01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:56.407
The Lieutenant quotes chapter
and verse, Mr. Fields.

01:33:56.507 --> 01:33:59.618
This is a gentleman who rejoices
in the name of Charlie the Handle.

01:34:00.344 --> 01:34:03.455
Identified as a member
of the kidnap team.

01:34:03.806 --> 01:34:06.709
He will lead us to Mr. Larkin.

01:34:07.059 --> 01:34:09.420
Kind of unusual, Melvin.

01:34:10.354 --> 01:34:14.133
Couple of professional cops telling you
what's best for your client.

01:34:14.233 --> 01:34:15.509
Knock it off, Brannigan.

01:34:15.609 --> 01:34:17.845
If Larkin's friends in the States
find out I'm in bed with the Yard,

01:34:17.945 --> 01:34:20.305
they'll part my hair with a blowtorch.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.686
It's all there,
you don't have to count it.

01:34:25.786 --> 01:34:27.939
Well, if you lose Larkin and that loot,

01:34:28.039 --> 01:34:31.317
they'll part more than your hair
with that blowtorch.

01:34:31.417 --> 01:34:35.488
Earthy, but accurate, I would have thought.
If you'll accept my apologies,

01:34:35.588 --> 01:34:38.782
Mr. Fields, I really must insist
that you give us the time.

01:34:39.592 --> 01:34:41.869
Something's coming in, sir.

01:34:41.969 --> 01:34:43.370
Put it on the speaker.

01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:49.668
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.

01:34:49.894 --> 01:34:51.462
Now you contact us

01:34:51.562 --> 01:34:57.718
on marine frequency 15.2. Repeat, 15.2.

01:34:58.152 --> 01:35:00.930
We will use different frequencies
to contact you,

01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:04.558
and you will have only four seconds
to make the change.

01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:08.061
Calling Mel Fields.

01:35:08.954 --> 01:35:12.858
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.
Are you there, Fields?

01:35:16.754 --> 01:35:18.030
This is Mel Fields.

01:35:18.130 --> 01:35:21.867
Now, I'm going to give it to you
just once, so get it good.

01:35:23.010 --> 01:35:25.621
This is how you make the drop.

01:35:26.055 --> 01:35:29.666
You leave the hotel
in exactly 10 minutes.

01:35:31.352 --> 01:35:35.047
And make sure you come alone.
Have you got that, Fields?

01:35:36.399 --> 01:35:38.258
Yes, I've got it.

01:35:39.527 --> 01:35:41.929
But I've run into a slight snag.

01:35:42.488 --> 01:35:44.598
What's the problem?

01:35:45.241 --> 01:35:46.642
There's no problem.

01:35:46.742 --> 01:35:50.854
But the bank needs four or five hours
more to get the money together.

01:35:51.831 --> 01:35:53.733
What do you think, Geef? Coppers?

01:35:53.833 --> 01:35:55.234
For his sake, I hope not.

01:35:55.334 --> 01:35:57.111
Listen, Fields...

01:35:57.211 --> 01:36:00.447
Come on, Mel.
Bring the money here. Bring it!

01:36:03.801 --> 01:36:06.871
All right. You've just
bought yourself four hours.

01:36:06.971 --> 01:36:08.413
And then you've had it.

01:36:12.852 --> 01:36:13.961
Then you've had it.

01:36:19.942 --> 01:36:21.343
All right.

01:36:22.027 --> 01:36:25.138
You've got four hours
to get Larkin back.

01:36:26.157 --> 01:36:29.560
But if you don't, I make the payment.

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.229
And I won't tell you where or when.

01:36:32.329 --> 01:36:33.522
Fair enough.

01:36:33.622 --> 01:36:35.274
And, Commander Swann,

01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:39.820
I want your word that there'll be
no surveillance of any kind.

01:36:40.171 --> 01:36:41.947
You have my word, sir.

01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:46.451
Oh, and be sure to call room service
if you need anything.

01:36:50.347 --> 01:36:51.915
I will.

01:36:54.685 --> 01:36:56.587
Find anything?

01:36:59.815 --> 01:37:02.551
She's clean, sir. Except for this.

01:37:04.487 --> 01:37:06.555
Long-range homing device.

01:37:09.909 --> 01:37:12.644
You can't trust anybody these days.

01:37:36.810 --> 01:37:39.087
Stay back, not too close.

01:40:13.926 --> 01:40:15.869
It's okay. He's alone.

01:41:20.325 --> 01:41:23.896
Well, come on, make the payoff
and let's get the hell out of here.

01:41:23.996 --> 01:41:25.772
Not yet, Ben.

01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.194
What do you mean, not yet?

01:41:30.294 --> 01:41:32.445
Charlie. Geef.

01:41:33.338 --> 01:41:36.199
- You're early, Fields.
- Yeah.

01:41:36.759 --> 01:41:38.327
Has he been a good boy?

01:41:38.427 --> 01:41:40.245
He never raised a finger.

01:41:40.345 --> 01:41:43.415
Oh, bad joke, Geef.

01:41:47.269 --> 01:41:49.212
Good job, Charlie.

01:41:54.359 --> 01:41:55.386
Well, come on, get them off!

01:41:55.486 --> 01:41:57.482
Get back,

01:41:57.582 --> 01:42:00.824
on your big fat... rear.

01:42:06.872 --> 01:42:08.315
Well.

01:42:11.210 --> 01:42:13.278
What's going on?

01:42:15.839 --> 01:42:19.284
You know, I think it's about time.

01:42:19.384 --> 01:42:21.077
Yes.

01:42:22.054 --> 01:42:24.297
But this is my party, Charlie.

01:42:27.392 --> 01:42:28.835
Ben,

01:42:31.897 --> 01:42:33.632
the first time we met,

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.802
you told me something
I've never forgotten.

01:42:37.903 --> 01:42:40.722
It's my golden rule, you might say.

01:42:41.490 --> 01:42:44.935
Never trust anybody.

01:43:02.094 --> 01:43:03.287
Mel, have you gone out of your...

01:43:25.534 --> 01:43:28.353
We pulled it off, Ben. We did it!

01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:33.025
Oh, I'm sorry about your finger, Ben.
I'm really sorry.

01:43:33.125 --> 01:43:36.111
I bet you are, yeah.
For a million bucks, it was worth it.

01:43:36.211 --> 01:43:39.864
And don't forget the first payment
I've got stashed away.

01:43:40.924 --> 01:43:42.201
How do I get this thing off?

01:43:42.301 --> 01:43:43.786
The key's over by the mirror.

01:43:43.886 --> 01:43:47.831
It's first class for you
all the way to South America

01:43:48.473 --> 01:43:50.375
and on into the sunset.

01:43:52.269 --> 01:43:55.839
And this makes up for that bath
I took in that Jupiter stock.

01:43:55.939 --> 01:43:58.550
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:43:58.650 --> 01:44:00.093
We got wall-to-wall alibis.

01:44:00.193 --> 01:44:03.222
Oh, Scotland Yard will swear
that I cooperated.

01:44:03.322 --> 01:44:04.640
I made the payments.

01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:09.102
And even that big clown Brannigan
backs up our story.

01:44:09.202 --> 01:44:11.479
As long as he's alive.

01:44:13.582 --> 01:44:19.112
You know, Mel, for a minute,
when you had that gun on me,

01:44:20.839 --> 01:44:23.241
I thought you were gonna get greedy.

01:44:24.343 --> 01:44:27.245
You know, for a minute, Ben,
I was tempted.

01:44:28.055 --> 01:44:31.750
But what the hell kind of world would it be
if you couldn't trust somebody?

01:45:18.522 --> 01:45:20.173
We've been had.

01:45:24.695 --> 01:45:26.096
Knock knock.

01:45:26.405 --> 01:45:28.056
Brannigan!

01:45:28.156 --> 01:45:29.975
I wouldn't.

01:45:30.075 --> 01:45:32.685
Unless you wanna sing soprano.

01:45:32.995 --> 01:45:36.356
Earthy, but I agree with my friend.

01:45:53.557 --> 01:45:56.167
They're all yours, Lieutenant.

01:46:01.231 --> 01:46:03.716
Don't worry about me, James.

01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:05.593
Bye-bye.

01:46:08.447 --> 01:46:10.890
And I mean bye-bye.

01:46:17.247 --> 01:46:20.192
That fella don't quit easy, does he?

01:46:20.292 --> 01:46:22.110
Well, do you think
you can hang on to them

01:46:22.210 --> 01:46:24.905
until I can get them
a couple of airplane tickets?

01:46:25.005 --> 01:46:27.324
Oh, I think we can manage that, yes.

01:46:27.424 --> 01:46:29.451
I just hope you don't lose them
back in the Colonies.

01:46:30.635 --> 01:46:31.745
Safe trip.

01:46:31.845 --> 01:46:33.329
Thank you.

01:46:51.698 --> 01:46:54.017
How about a lift, Yank?

01:47:15.722 --> 01:47:17.123
Jim!

01:47:28.568 --> 01:47:29.886
Jim! Jim!

01:47:29.986 --> 01:47:31.263
I'm all right.

01:47:34.324 --> 01:47:36.059
Over here!

01:47:40.872 --> 01:47:42.273
Now!

01:47:43.583 --> 01:47:45.485
Get behind that car!

01:50:05.267 --> 01:50:09.629
Well, I'm going to miss this old town.

01:50:10.313 --> 01:50:12.465
It's going to miss you.

01:50:13.692 --> 01:50:17.304
I'm not sure if I agree with what
my old dad said about you Yanks.

01:50:17.404 --> 01:50:20.932
You mean that part
about us being overpaid?

01:50:21.032 --> 01:50:23.267
No, over here.

01:50:24.411 --> 01:50:27.105
Jenny, it's been great.

01:50:27.205 --> 01:50:28.747
It has.

01:50:28.748 --> 01:50:30.316
So long.
