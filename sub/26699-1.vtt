02:15.178 --> 02:18.877
Hello. Is this
a David D. Finch?

02:18.921 --> 02:21.967
Uh, yes. Yes, it is.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.752
My name is
Claire Decker.

02:23.795 --> 02:26.972
I'm a freelance investigator
for San Luis Obispo County

02:27.016 --> 02:28.626
for Social Services.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.890
I found a birthday card
from 1992.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.980
It's great work again,
Claire.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.635
You sure I can't
hire you full-time?

02:40.247 --> 02:43.467
You know, uh, my nephew,

02:43.511 --> 02:46.122
he still talks
about you.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.212
He's an associate professor
now at Cal Poly.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.561
Thank you.

02:50.605 --> 02:52.302
Architecture.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.564
That's very sweet,

02:53.608 --> 02:56.263
but I don't think so.
I'm sorry.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.786
Well, I had to try.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.314
I want you
to take this case.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.276
I couldn't.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.669
Sure, you could,
and it'll do you good.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.455
You're always saying how all
you do is sit around at home.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.283
The truth be told
is I don't really want

03:16.326 --> 03:17.980
to give this
to one of my people.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.374
I think this case would be
best handled out of house.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.202
I don't know.

03:26.423 --> 03:30.601
You know, we're so seldom
assigned murder victims,

03:30.645 --> 03:34.562
and there has never been a case
like this in our department.

03:37.956 --> 03:39.741
This is important to me.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.962
Now, you'll have to meet
with Sheriff Mann.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.834
He and I have a little
bit of a history,

03:45.877 --> 03:48.271
so he's gonna angle to try and
get you thrown off the case

03:48.315 --> 03:51.622
at every corner, but the fact
is that after six months,

03:51.666 --> 03:53.885
if the decedent has
no known relatives,

03:53.929 --> 03:56.758
then they are required
to report it to us.

03:59.413 --> 04:02.111
You could be doing
some good here, Claire.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.027
You're an excellent
investigator.

04:05.070 --> 04:05.984
You are.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.867
Have fun.

04:18.910 --> 04:19.998
Thanks a lot.

05:56.921 --> 05:59.359
I like you, Claire.
We've worked together before,

05:59.402 --> 06:01.317
but this is
not what you do.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.928
This is not some spinster
found dead all alone.

06:03.972 --> 06:08.542
This is not some old man found in a
remote farmhouse on Black Mountain Road.

06:08.585 --> 06:09.760
This is not that.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.415
I'm simply
following protocol, sir.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.550
I called Vivian--
Ms. Hershey--directly.

06:16.593 --> 06:19.248
I asked her
not to intervene.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.337
She does this
just to spite me.

06:22.512 --> 06:23.861
Look.

06:33.915 --> 06:34.829
Yeah.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.137
Claire, look.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.489
She was shot
through the heart.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.057
Her head severed
from her body

06:46.101 --> 06:48.277
with almost
surgical precision.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.193
Both of her hands removed,
cut clean through the bone,

06:51.236 --> 06:53.325
most likely with
a medical power saw.

06:53.369 --> 06:56.024
Her breast implants
were sliced from her torso

06:56.067 --> 06:59.549
with a scalpel
or very sharp razor.

06:59.593 --> 07:03.858
This is the picture
that the public sees.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.425
This...

07:05.468 --> 07:07.383
is what I see.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.691
This is why
I can't sleep at night.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.782
How are your daughters,
sir?

07:16.348 --> 07:18.481
They're good. Heh.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.352
They're great, actually.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.180
Loves of my life.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.269
They've really
bounced back since--

07:24.313 --> 07:25.923
well, since my wife died.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.492
Sir, I haven't had a chance
to tell you personally,

07:29.536 --> 07:31.494
I'm so sorry.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.626
Thank you.

07:34.889 --> 07:39.284
I've made you a confidential
copy of the case file.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.678
As you know,
our victim took great pains

07:41.722 --> 07:44.420
to make sure that her
identity was a secret.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.075
Her driver's license, social
security card, both fake.

07:47.118 --> 07:50.861
That's not even her picture,
just some actress from L.A.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.647
She rented
the Chandler house

07:53.690 --> 07:56.127
almost exactly three months
before the murder.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.086
It's hidden up there,
but it's really one

07:58.129 --> 07:59.783
of the most beautiful
houses on the coast,

07:59.827 --> 08:01.132
so it's not cheap.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.353
She kept mostly to herself.

08:04.396 --> 08:07.095
She did do some volunteer work
for a local food bank

08:07.138 --> 08:09.967
delivering, you know, meals to
the elderly, to the infirm.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.534
There's a list in there.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.798
She also had a series of...

08:14.842 --> 08:17.758
one-night stands,
both men and women.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.151
You'll find wigs, perfume...

08:21.370 --> 08:23.546
sexual items
up at the house.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.200
She would lure
these people there.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.810
They'd drink
and do drugs and...

08:28.377 --> 08:31.511
She was not a good girl,
not like you.

08:33.469 --> 08:37.559
Claire, your job
is strictly her identity.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.432
Do not get involved
with the murder investigation.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.392
The caretaker has the keys.

08:43.434 --> 08:44.915
He knows you're coming.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.439
You'll have access
for 24 hours a day,

08:47.483 --> 08:49.703
whenever you want to
at the house,

08:49.746 --> 08:51.966
although I don't know
what you'll see.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.750
We've been over every inch.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.279
What do you think?

09:01.323 --> 09:03.760
To be honest...

09:03.804 --> 09:06.546
I'm afraid she might find
something we missed.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.593
He thinks
I'm this wallflower.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.769
Well, you are a wallflower.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.430
God, I can't believe
you're on this case.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.737
Don't you have to be at
rehearsal or something?

09:23.780 --> 09:27.001
Your--Your boyfriend James,
he just got a new car.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.438
Why don't you go take
a long, hard ride?

09:32.354 --> 09:34.835
I'm playing Chopin
at the festival on Friday.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.097
I'll leave two tickets.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.446
Okay.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.235
Can you drop it?

09:46.760 --> 09:48.892
I don't know
if I can do anything,

09:48.936 --> 09:51.112
but I'll try.

10:09.783 --> 10:13.047
Listen, when she moved in,
was the house completely empty?

10:14.135 --> 10:16.920
Yes,
except for the phone.

10:16.964 --> 10:21.055
She told me she had bad
credit and no credit cards.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.231
They'd made her put
the phone in my name.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.668
She even used my old
answering machine.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.278
Who uses those anymore?

10:28.410 --> 10:29.716
Look.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.674
There's one now.

10:31.718 --> 10:34.459
Still
the lookie-loos.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.636
They'll drive right up
here in her driveway.

10:36.679 --> 10:39.551
I even catch 'em sneaking
around the yard.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.076
I should remove it.

12:51.335 --> 12:54.338
♪ I see her every day

12:55.862 --> 12:59.256
♪ She come out,
but she don't play ♪

13:01.258 --> 13:03.347
♪ Red heels, red lips

13:15.533 --> 13:18.101
What's with
all the plants?

13:18.145 --> 13:19.537
Yeah, I picked them up
last night.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.498
I just realized it seemed
so empty in here.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.804
Hmm.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.114
Her house is amazing.

13:31.158 --> 13:34.030
She has such nice things,

13:34.074 --> 13:37.642
her makeup, her perfume.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.775
Are you
wearing contacts?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.430
Yeah. I hardly
ever wear them, but--

13:44.475 --> 13:48.740
The thing is that I know that Mann
is gonna get me thrown off the case

13:48.784 --> 13:50.830
if I find
anything substantial.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.179
You gonna go back there?

13:55.356 --> 13:58.054
She has a whole drawer
full of sex toys.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.665
We need to go shopping.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.157
Hey, Claire.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.724
Good morning, Annie.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.858
You're here like
clockwork every week.

14:22.296 --> 14:25.168
Oh, and what's this? Are
we getting kinda fancy?

14:25.212 --> 14:26.430
Going out
this weekend?

14:27.779 --> 14:28.868
It's gonna look
really good on you.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.979
Hello, Claire.

17:07.503 --> 17:09.854
Sheriff.

17:09.897 --> 17:12.857
Thought I'd swing by,
see how you were doing.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.642
Doing fine.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.644
Find anything?

17:16.686 --> 17:18.950
There's not much
to see so far.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.780
Nice car.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.042
It's beautiful.

17:25.957 --> 17:29.396
You know, keep me informed
if you find anything.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.398
Of course, sir.

17:31.441 --> 17:34.575
I'm gonna go around and talk to
some of the neighbors tomorrow.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.059
You look good, Claire.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.941
Vivian, hi.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.639
Hey. Just checking in.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.946
Yeah, I was gonna just
call you in the morning.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.948
I'm still
going through stuff.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.515
Hmm. Have you
found anything?

20:14.996 --> 20:17.390
No.Well, just so you know,

20:17.433 --> 20:19.087
Mann called again
this morning,

20:19.130 --> 20:20.567
asking me to take you
off the case,

20:20.610 --> 20:22.264
and I just politely
told him to fuck off.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.311
Thank you.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.400
Well, you find anything,

20:27.443 --> 20:29.489
you let me know.

20:29.532 --> 20:30.838
Have a good night.

20:30.881 --> 20:31.969
Okay.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.300
I like the new look,
Claire.

22:01.798 --> 22:06.542
She brought strange men back to
that apartment time and time again.

22:06.586 --> 22:08.283
This is
a nice community.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.589
It's respectable.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.507
She was
amazingly beautiful,

22:14.550 --> 22:17.553
and she seemed
like such a nice person.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.484
Oh, you said
you'd come back.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.401
Um, no,
I'm sorry, ma'am.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.272
My name is
Claire Decker.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.709
I'm a freelance
investigator

22:42.752 --> 22:44.798
for San Luis Obispo County
for Social Services.

22:44.841 --> 22:46.582
I don't talk to police.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.192
I'm sorry.
I'm--I'm not police.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.369
You're wearing her perfume.

22:51.805 --> 22:52.980
Yes...

22:53.023 --> 22:54.982
I am.

22:55.025 --> 22:57.506
She was
a very nice young lady.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.291
Ma'am, would it be okay

23:00.335 --> 23:03.382
if I asked you a few
questions about her?

23:03.425 --> 23:05.993
We'd like to find out
who she was,

23:06.036 --> 23:08.343
settle her estate.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.564
My name is Teresa Suskind.
Come in.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.435
Please, sit down.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.220
I would
offer you coffee,

23:16.264 --> 23:18.353
but I'm out of supplies.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.225
Juliette used
to bring me supplies

23:21.269 --> 23:23.227
from the food bank
every once in a while.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.316
So how well
did you know Juliette?

23:25.360 --> 23:29.625
Oh, she'd stop by
once or twice a week.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.279
She liked to talk.

23:31.322 --> 23:34.108
Did she ever tell you
anything about her life,

23:34.151 --> 23:36.719
any places that she
had lived before?

23:36.763 --> 23:38.025
That perfume.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.811
I'm so sorry.

23:43.987 --> 23:46.990
If you'll forgive me,
I just need a moment.

23:49.210 --> 23:50.907
Of course.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.433
Are you all right?

23:54.476 --> 23:57.044
Juliette is
not coming back.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.705
I've seen...

24:06.793 --> 24:08.011
photographs. Uh...

24:09.448 --> 24:11.493
It's so very sad.

24:11.537 --> 24:16.933
Teresa, do you
have any family?

24:16.977 --> 24:21.460
Would people know who to contact
in case of an emergency?

24:24.158 --> 24:26.160
It's back there, dear,

24:26.203 --> 24:28.467
in the closet
just before the bedroom.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.472
It's something
you should have.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.257
Uh...

24:44.570 --> 24:46.180
On the floor.

24:46.223 --> 24:48.748
The last time
she was here,

24:48.791 --> 24:50.967
she left it.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.797
If she's not
coming back for it,

24:54.841 --> 24:58.497
well, you'll know
what to do with it.

26:34.244 --> 26:35.550
Hello. This is
Juliette Towne.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.204
I'm not here right now,

26:37.247 --> 26:40.076
so please leave your name
and number. Thanks.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.338
Adios.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.517
Hello, Claire.

28:10.645 --> 28:11.602
Right. Well--

28:11.646 --> 28:12.865
Yeah.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.742
You like my dress?

28:21.917 --> 28:24.311
Yeah. It's nice.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.500
Good morning,
Detective Mann.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.328
Claire, there was a
break-in last night,

30:08.371 --> 30:10.591
an elderly blind
woman, Teresa Suskind.

30:10.634 --> 30:13.202
She lives in that yellow
trailer on Scott Street.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.030
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

30:15.074 --> 30:17.119
She's fine.
The place was ransacked.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.121
Nothing was taken.
It was a man.

30:19.165 --> 30:22.429
Now, Claire,
the landlord said

30:22.472 --> 30:26.520
that she saw you
at Teresa's yesterday.

30:26.563 --> 30:29.958
I did speak
to her yesterday, yes,

30:30.002 --> 30:31.917
and some other people
on the list.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.223
Uh-huh.

30:34.267 --> 30:37.052
So you spoke to a woman
who never talks to us,

30:37.096 --> 30:41.796
and, that night,
there was a break-in?

30:45.582 --> 30:47.497
Is there anything you're
not telling me, Claire?

31:01.903 --> 31:03.339
How's it going?

31:03.383 --> 31:04.514
Hey.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.003
Her name is Jessica.

31:16.526 --> 31:17.876
Yeah.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.095
These were given to me

31:20.139 --> 31:22.141
by an elderly neighbor
of hers,

31:22.184 --> 31:24.186
a woman who she used
to deliver meals to.

31:24.230 --> 31:26.710
Now, the woman is blind, but
they had many conversations.

31:26.754 --> 31:28.625
Wait. Are you sure
these are the decedent's?

31:28.669 --> 31:31.585
I mean, maybe she had a child. No, I know.

31:31.628 --> 31:34.283
I haven't brought these
to the attention

31:34.327 --> 31:36.242
of the Sheriff's
Department yet.

31:36.285 --> 31:40.376
Now, Vivian, you know that as soon
as I find a substantial lead,

31:40.420 --> 31:42.509
he's gonna throw me
off the case.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.076
I can find out more.

31:44.119 --> 31:46.861
Well, look, it's been
six months since the murder.

31:46.905 --> 31:50.212
I suppose a couple more days
isn't gonna hurt anything.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.519
You do what you need to do,

31:52.562 --> 31:55.783
but you make sure it does not
reflect badly on this department.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.176
Thank you.
I'll call you.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.133
Sure.

31:59.613 --> 32:00.962
Whew.

32:01.006 --> 32:03.312
Our little girl,
she's all grown up.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.758
Hey. You going on a trip?

32:14.802 --> 32:17.326
Could I ask you
a small favor?

32:17.370 --> 32:21.765
Could you watch this
for me for a couple of days?

32:21.809 --> 32:23.550
Uh, hide it?

32:23.593 --> 32:25.465
I know that it
sounds really strange.

32:25.508 --> 32:28.250
It's a long story, and I
can't get into it right now,

32:28.294 --> 32:29.948
but it's really
important to me.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.167
It's fine. Don't worry.
I'll hide it for you.

32:32.211 --> 32:34.648
Oh, and...

32:34.691 --> 32:36.128
don't open it.

32:36.171 --> 32:40.175
I'm not gonna open
your suitcase, Claire.

32:40.219 --> 32:43.004
Great. Thank you.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.050
Sure.

32:45.093 --> 32:47.835
Who's that? That's my daughter.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.750
She's coming to town
for a few days.

32:49.793 --> 32:51.012
Yeah,
I'm really excited.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.362
I did not know
that you had a daughter.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.843
Yeah. There's a lot
you don't know.

32:55.886 --> 32:58.454
Maybe, uh--maybe
you can meet her.

32:58.498 --> 33:01.457
We can go for a picnic
or something like that.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.155
That's...

33:03.198 --> 33:07.159
Or maybe I can just watch
your suitcase for you.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.682
Thank you.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.381
Hello. This is
Juliette Towne.

33:55.424 --> 33:56.773
I'm not here right now,

33:56.817 --> 34:00.647
so please leave your name
and number. Thanks.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.562
Adios.

34:08.958 --> 34:12.092
You think you can get away
with this, Claire?

34:17.402 --> 34:19.405
That smells delicious.

34:24.801 --> 34:28.022
You didn't turn in
the suitcase, did you?

34:28.065 --> 34:30.503
I did not.

34:30.545 --> 34:33.505
Feels good to do the wrong
thing sometimes, hmm?

34:35.507 --> 34:37.945
It does.

34:37.987 --> 34:40.382
Be a bad girl.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.471
I'm sorry
about the break-in.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.126
He was looking for that
suitcase, wasn't he?

34:45.170 --> 34:46.518
Of course, my dear.

34:46.562 --> 34:49.261
Did he speak?
Did he say anything?

34:49.304 --> 34:52.393
I spoke to him.

34:52.438 --> 34:56.746
He was not very happy by the
time he walked out that door.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.313
Is he the killer?

34:58.357 --> 35:01.055
Oh, no.
He was an errand boy.

35:02.404 --> 35:06.191
Have you always
been so shy, Claire?

35:06.234 --> 35:08.149
I'm not shy.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.195
I'm not shy.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.545
I just like being alone.

35:12.588 --> 35:15.852
I was the same way,
my dear,

35:15.896 --> 35:17.985
until I met my husband.

35:18.028 --> 35:21.380
It's amazing
how love changes you.

35:23.338 --> 35:25.862
Your hair changes,
your clothes,

35:25.906 --> 35:27.299
the way you speak.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.564
But it happens
on the inside, too.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.828
One day, you wake up...

35:37.047 --> 35:40.138
and you're
a different person.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.516
WOMAN, WHISPERING: Wait up.
There's someone in there.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.082
Oh, God.

40:51.579 --> 40:52.841
Oh, go, go.

41:48.157 --> 41:49.681
Good morning, John.

41:49.724 --> 41:52.161
Claire, were you
here at the house

41:52.205 --> 41:53.598
around midnight
last night?

41:53.641 --> 41:56.383
No, I left at 8:00.

41:56.426 --> 41:58.994
Well, I received an e-mail this
morning from "The Tribune"

41:59.038 --> 42:01.083
with a photograph
they're gonna run with.

42:01.127 --> 42:02.258
A photograph?

42:02.302 --> 42:04.826
Yeah, it's on
their website already.

42:04.870 --> 42:06.262
Do you have
your house keys?

42:06.306 --> 42:07.742
Uh, yeah. I have
them right here.

42:07.786 --> 42:09.396
Well, there must have
been a break-in.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.529
Oh, my God.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.313
You did lock
all the doors when you left?

42:13.356 --> 42:15.837
Could this image
have been manipulated?

42:15.881 --> 42:17.926
"Trib" assures me
that it's not.

42:17.970 --> 42:19.928
It was given to them
by two teenage girls.

42:19.972 --> 42:21.887
They even admit
to being here last night,

42:21.930 --> 42:22.931
even trying the door.

42:22.975 --> 42:25.847
Oh, this is spooky.

42:25.891 --> 42:28.546
I'm gonna need
to dust for prints today.

42:28.589 --> 42:29.590
Are you coming by?

42:29.634 --> 42:31.157
No, John.
I have other plans.

43:12.111 --> 43:13.765
Welcome to Hotel Rex.

43:13.808 --> 43:15.810
Hi. I'm just curious
about the orchids

43:15.854 --> 43:17.290
that you have
in the window.

43:17.333 --> 43:19.292
Oh, yes. We have fresh flowers
in all the rooms.

43:19.335 --> 43:21.599
We also have a delivery
service for our guests.

43:21.642 --> 43:23.296
We do weddings, events.

43:23.339 --> 43:26.604
Oh, we also deliver for the
medical center up the street.

43:26.647 --> 43:29.998
Thank you. Is it okay
if I just have a drink?

43:30.042 --> 43:32.305
Of course. Please.
Enjoy our happy hour.

43:37.571 --> 43:39.573
Well, good afternoon.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.881
Hello.
I'll have a vodka...

43:42.924 --> 43:44.447
martini.

43:44.491 --> 43:45.797
With a twist?

43:47.189 --> 43:48.321
How 'bout dirty?

43:49.409 --> 43:50.366
Sure.

43:50.410 --> 43:52.020
All right.

44:01.421 --> 44:04.293
...he's coming in,
and he's busting my chops...

44:07.732 --> 44:09.821
Can I put it
to your room?

44:09.864 --> 44:12.171
No. I'm not staying here.

44:12.214 --> 44:15.217
A friend...

44:16.523 --> 44:19.178
stayed here,
and she recommended it,

44:19.221 --> 44:21.528
so I thought I would try it.

44:21.571 --> 44:23.138
Well, it is
a great place.

44:23.182 --> 44:24.966
Seems like a nice area.

44:25.010 --> 44:27.403
Oh, yeah, it is. I mean, we're
so close to Union Square,

44:27.447 --> 44:29.318
great shopping,
and museums,

44:29.362 --> 44:33.496
and we're lucky to have the medical
center right up the street.

44:33.540 --> 44:35.890
What kind
of medical center is it?

44:35.934 --> 44:39.198
Well,
I shouldn't really say,

44:39.241 --> 44:41.156
but it's mostly
plastic surgery.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.767
We have deals with
many of the doctors.

44:42.810 --> 44:44.725
Their patients
stay here.

44:44.769 --> 44:47.859
You know, they check in the night
before they have a little work done.

44:47.902 --> 44:49.034
Huh.

44:52.037 --> 44:54.866
My friend did that.

44:54.909 --> 44:56.302
Actually...

44:56.345 --> 44:59.305
there's one of the
doctors right there.

44:59.348 --> 45:02.917
He comes in almost every
day for happy hour,

45:02.961 --> 45:04.440
Dr. Barry Hardin.

45:05.572 --> 45:07.617
Nice guy.

45:07.661 --> 45:08.880
Thank you.

45:08.923 --> 45:11.012
I'll be right here.
Enjoy your drink.

45:29.639 --> 45:31.467
I am fairly certain
that she was here.

45:31.511 --> 45:33.774
Is there any way that you
could look it up for me?

45:33.818 --> 45:37.343
I'm afraid you're gonna have to put
that request in through corporate.

45:37.386 --> 45:41.042
I'm not allowed to give that kind of
information about guests who stay here.

45:41.086 --> 45:42.174
Of course. Thank you.

45:43.305 --> 45:44.567
Adios.

46:39.448 --> 46:41.581
You're back. It's getting late,

46:41.624 --> 46:43.017
and I don't want
to drive home.

46:43.061 --> 46:44.497
Do you have any available
rooms tonight?

46:44.540 --> 46:46.368
We do, actually.
Let me see what we have.

46:46.412 --> 46:47.326
Great.

47:06.475 --> 47:11.132
This is
the SLO News Radio archive.

47:11.176 --> 47:13.265
The FBI have announced
that apparent suicide

47:13.308 --> 47:16.224
is the probable cause for the
disappearance of Sylvia Hardin,

47:16.268 --> 47:18.836
the wife of San Francisco
plastic surgeon Barry Hardin.

47:20.402 --> 47:22.883
She disappeared an estimated
100 miles east of Oahu...

47:22.927 --> 47:24.232
John.

47:24.276 --> 47:26.495
Claire. I've been
at the house all day.

47:26.539 --> 47:28.019
No locks are broken.

47:28.062 --> 47:30.282
There's no signs
of forced entry.

47:30.325 --> 47:32.675
There's no new
fingerprints except yours,

47:32.719 --> 47:34.460
and they are everywhere.

47:34.503 --> 47:36.897
Well, it's my job to be there
and go through everything.

47:36.941 --> 47:38.725
It's hard to find
a print of the victim's.

47:38.768 --> 47:39.857
You seem to have
taken over.

47:41.075 --> 47:42.424
I'm assigning
a car out front

47:42.468 --> 47:43.425
for the next
24 hours.

47:43.469 --> 47:45.514
Are you
coming by tonight?

47:45.558 --> 47:46.689
No.
I'm in San Francisco.

47:46.733 --> 47:48.256
Not to do
with the case?

47:48.300 --> 47:50.824
It's the anniversary
of my parents' death.

47:50.868 --> 47:53.740
They passed away in a boating
accident in the bay here,

47:53.783 --> 47:55.089
so I--I come up
every year.

47:56.221 --> 47:57.831
I'm sorry
to hear that.

47:58.963 --> 47:59.877
Thank you.

48:01.269 --> 48:02.792
Anyway, I'll be
heading back tomorrow,

48:02.836 --> 48:04.620
and I will be going
to the house,

48:04.664 --> 48:07.754
so should only need
another day or two,

48:07.797 --> 48:10.409
and then I'll file my report
and give it over to you.

48:10.452 --> 48:12.237
Good.

48:15.762 --> 48:16.719
That's the one.

48:16.763 --> 48:20.288
I saw her
wearing it.

48:20.332 --> 48:21.637
Fuck.

48:21.681 --> 48:23.291
...probable cause
for the disappearance

48:23.335 --> 48:25.772
of Sylvia Hardin,
the wife of San Francisco

48:25.815 --> 48:27.730
plastic surgeon
Barry Hardin.

48:27.774 --> 48:31.299
She disappeared an estimated
100 miles east of Oahu

48:31.343 --> 48:33.911
while on a South Seas
cruise three weeks ago.

48:33.954 --> 48:37.349
After intensive interviews with the
doctor and numerous witnesses,

48:37.392 --> 48:39.090
no charges
have been filed.

48:39.133 --> 48:41.266
Sylvia Hardin
was 34 years old

48:41.309 --> 48:43.572
and a noted philanthropist
in the city.

48:43.616 --> 48:46.358
Despite a three-day search by the U.S.
Coast Guard,

48:46.401 --> 48:47.968
no body
has been recovered.

49:36.103 --> 49:37.670
Here's your martini.

49:37.713 --> 49:38.932
Cheers.

50:17.231 --> 50:18.928
It's almost last call.

50:20.669 --> 50:23.020
May I, uh,
buy you another martini?

50:26.936 --> 50:28.199
Yes.

51:36.919 --> 51:39.705
I was going to call you, but Tina
said you were out of town working.

51:39.748 --> 51:42.316
Yeah. What's up?

51:44.318 --> 51:47.843
There was a guy at your door
last night when I got home.

51:47.887 --> 51:51.499
I'm pretty sure he
was trying to break in,

51:51.543 --> 51:54.850
so I called out to him,
but he used your name,

51:54.894 --> 51:57.331
said he was
a friend of yours.

51:57.375 --> 51:59.812
Ah, it's nothing
to worry about.

51:59.855 --> 52:01.335
He had a gun, Claire.

52:02.902 --> 52:07.080
Yeah, I saw it
underneath his jacket.

52:07.124 --> 52:10.301
Does this have anything to do
with that suitcase you left me?

52:10.344 --> 52:12.085
Is that
what he was after?

52:15.567 --> 52:16.872
Yes.

52:16.916 --> 52:19.179
I knew you'd
surprise me one day,

52:19.223 --> 52:22.139
but I never
expected this. Um...

52:22.182 --> 52:25.881
look, I'm happy to help out a
neighbor, help you out, Claire,

52:25.925 --> 52:30.321
but I can't have that,
ever.

52:30.364 --> 52:31.322
You understand?

52:31.365 --> 52:34.325
I have my daughter
in town.

52:34.368 --> 52:37.154
I can't be involved in
anything illegal or dangerous.

52:38.416 --> 52:40.287
Of course.

52:42.724 --> 52:44.422
I'm really sorry.

52:44.465 --> 52:47.381
I can come right now,
take it back.

52:47.425 --> 52:51.342
Okay, good, 'cause this
needs to be a safe place

52:51.385 --> 52:55.172
all the time, but
especially when she's here.

53:21.415 --> 53:22.764
Teresa?

53:24.331 --> 53:26.159
Can I ask
a small favor?

53:34.211 --> 53:36.822
I've put the suitcase back in the closet.
I'll be back for it.

53:36.865 --> 53:40.608
So nice of you
to stop by, Juliette.

53:40.652 --> 53:41.827
Teresa, I'm Claire.

53:41.870 --> 53:45.309
Claire. Of course.

53:45.352 --> 53:46.658
I'm sorry, dear.

53:46.701 --> 53:49.922
I can't keep the suitcase
at my house,

53:49.965 --> 53:52.620
but the man
who's looking for it,

53:52.664 --> 53:54.492
he won't check back here.

53:54.535 --> 53:57.408
No, he won't.

53:59.192 --> 54:00.933
Teresa, are you all right?

54:00.976 --> 54:02.151
I'm just fine.

54:03.544 --> 54:06.068
I have some advice
for you.

54:09.289 --> 54:11.813
Don't ever get old.

54:14.555 --> 54:16.557
Could this body be
the doctor's wife, then?

54:16.601 --> 54:18.733
No, can't be.

54:18.777 --> 54:21.083
The cruise with
Sylvia Hardin on it

54:21.127 --> 54:24.565
left San Francisco three days
after that body was found.

54:24.609 --> 54:26.828
Also, that body was
never in the water.

54:28.003 --> 54:30.005
Oh, God. Uh...

54:30.049 --> 54:32.269
That body is Jessica.

54:32.312 --> 54:34.227
So Hardin has
an affair with Jessica.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.882
The wife can't take it.
She commits suicide.

54:36.925 --> 54:38.927
There are eyewitnesses
that saw Sylvia Hardin

54:38.971 --> 54:41.016
at the railing
of the cruise ship.

54:41.060 --> 54:43.323
Hardin was in the bar
at the time.

54:43.367 --> 54:45.107
He has an alibi, but...

54:46.718 --> 54:49.982
Jessica was
at the Hotel Rex.

54:52.027 --> 54:54.682
She stayed there.

54:56.118 --> 54:57.990
Hardin's there
all the time.

54:58.033 --> 54:59.948
He works
down the street.

55:01.254 --> 55:03.561
It can't be
a coincidence.

55:03.604 --> 55:06.390
And he's a doctor.

55:06.433 --> 55:08.740
So Hardin's the killer?

55:08.783 --> 55:09.958
He's involved somehow,

55:10.002 --> 55:12.787
and there is only
one way to find out.

55:12.831 --> 55:14.789
What are you gonna do?

55:14.833 --> 55:17.357
I'm gonna go
back up there tomorrow.

55:17.401 --> 55:20.055
Oh, well, I have a gig.
You should stop by.

55:20.099 --> 55:22.101
I'm confronting Hardin.

55:23.798 --> 55:27.062
I'm gonna confront him in
the bar of the Hotel Rex.

55:27.106 --> 55:30.152
If he did it, if he's
involved somehow...

55:32.241 --> 55:33.242
I'm gonna know.

55:33.286 --> 55:34.505
That's too dangerous.

55:34.548 --> 55:36.985
What if he's the kill--
Look at this.

55:37.029 --> 55:38.726
I don't care.
I have to know.

55:38.770 --> 55:41.512
As soon as I do it,

55:41.555 --> 55:43.818
I will turn everything
over to the police.

55:43.862 --> 55:46.517
What are you gonna say?

55:46.560 --> 55:49.868
I'm not gonna have
to say a single word.

56:59.459 --> 57:00.939
And what can I get you?

57:00.982 --> 57:03.463
I'll have a vodka martini,

57:03.507 --> 57:04.943
dirty.

57:32.405 --> 57:33.928
Jessica?

57:38.237 --> 57:39.456
I don't believe it.

57:43.938 --> 57:44.852
I'm sorry?

57:46.506 --> 57:48.116
Y-You're not Jessica.

57:49.248 --> 57:52.643
No. My name is Sylvia.

57:54.514 --> 57:56.690
Dr. Hardin,
good evening.

57:56.734 --> 57:57.909
The usual?

58:02.522 --> 58:03.828
No, thanks.

58:07.919 --> 58:09.268
I know.

58:18.495 --> 58:19.670
Hmm.

58:19.713 --> 58:22.020
What was that all about?

58:22.063 --> 58:23.717
I don't know.
He must have taken ill.

58:25.414 --> 58:28.026
It looked as if
he'd seen a ghost.

58:28.069 --> 58:30.681
Ah, that's it.

58:30.724 --> 58:33.248
You look very much like a
woman that used to stay here,

58:33.292 --> 58:34.598
Jessica Dupont.

58:36.991 --> 58:39.472
She knew the doctor.

58:41.735 --> 58:43.389
Did you know her?

58:43.432 --> 58:46.914
Yeah, she'd come in for a
drink every now and then,

58:46.958 --> 58:47.915
sit right there.

58:49.482 --> 58:50.918
Enjoy.

59:14.986 --> 59:16.727
Excuse me.

59:19.599 --> 59:21.209
Are you Jessica?

59:23.647 --> 59:25.300
I heard that man.

59:31.219 --> 59:34.875
Yes, I am Jessica.

59:36.050 --> 59:37.486
I'm Bianca.

59:37.530 --> 59:41.795
I had a friend who stayed here
about a year ago,

59:41.839 --> 59:47.496
and I swear she met you.

59:49.107 --> 59:51.892
Oh. Who was your friend?

59:51.936 --> 59:54.242
She was only here
for a night.

59:54.286 --> 59:56.767
I doubt you'd remember her.

59:56.810 --> 01:00:00.640
But she described
in great detail

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:06.254
the most exquisitely
beautiful ice blonde

01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:08.387
that she met here
at this bar.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.697
Would you like
to join me?

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:19.833
If you'll excuse me,
though,

01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:22.923
I just have to make
a quick phone call.

01:00:24.838 --> 01:00:27.841
Shouldn't take long.
I'll be back.

01:00:35.762 --> 01:00:36.850
Mann.

01:00:36.894 --> 01:00:38.460
John, it's Claire.

01:00:38.504 --> 01:00:40.593
Claire, I was
just about to call you.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.464
Teresa Suskind had
a very bad stroke.

01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:45.467
Her landlord found her. What?

01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:46.904
I went over there myself.

01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:48.732
You have to get
back there right away.

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:51.386
Th-There's a suitcase in the closet.
It belonged to Jessica.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:52.866
It's very important
that you get it.

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.433
Yes, I found it.

01:00:54.476 --> 01:00:56.653
It's sitting
right in front of me.

01:00:58.176 --> 01:01:00.265
Claire, I need you
to tell me everything.

01:01:00.308 --> 01:01:01.919
Who's Jessica?

01:01:01.962 --> 01:01:04.835
Juliette Towne's
real name is Jessica.

01:01:04.878 --> 01:01:06.663
Last name
might be Dupont.

01:01:06.706 --> 01:01:09.274
She spent a lot of time
here at the Hotel Rex

01:01:09.317 --> 01:01:11.319
in San Francisco. That's
where I am right now.

01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:16.063
I believe--I know
that she was murdered

01:01:16.107 --> 01:01:19.850
by a plastic surgeon
named Barry Hardin.

01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:24.593
Get a pen.
Start writing things down.

01:01:24.637 --> 01:01:27.553
Here you go. Enjoy.

01:01:27.596 --> 01:01:29.686
That's it.
That's everything.

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:34.125
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:01:34.168 --> 01:01:36.170
I'm so sorry.

01:01:36.214 --> 01:01:39.347
That took a little bit
longer than I expected.

01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:42.089
It's perfectly all right.

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:43.525
I ordered you
another drink.

01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:45.353
Oh, thank you.

01:01:45.397 --> 01:01:46.441
Extra dirty.

01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:48.748
Ah, that's
how I like it.

01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:58.062
You're so beautiful.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.936
Thank you.

01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:07.724
That phone call
seemed a little intense.

01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:11.771
Mm, it's been
quite a week.

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:15.209
It's over now,
which I guess is good,

01:02:15.253 --> 01:02:17.559
but I'm a little sad.

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:22.347
I had to find
something out,

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:23.696
and I did.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:29.658
A good friend of mine
used to say,

01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:31.617
"Don't cry
because it's over.

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.663
Smile because it happened."

01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:38.319
I like that.

01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:02.604

Good morning, John.

01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:09.791
Claire, SFPD went by
Hardin's early this morning.

01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:11.576
They found him dead,

01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:13.534
murdered, shot right
through the heart.

01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:16.711
That can't be.

01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:18.670
He's responsible
for Jessica's murder.

01:06:18.713 --> 01:06:21.716
I know. He might have
even done it himself.

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.805
I'm certain. I confronted
him last night

01:06:23.849 --> 01:06:25.590
in the lobby
of the Hotel Rex.

01:06:25.633 --> 01:06:26.591
You did what?

01:06:26.634 --> 01:06:28.288
I confronted him.

01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:30.595
Hardin confessed to you?

01:06:30.638 --> 01:06:34.599
No, but I could tell
by the look on his face.

01:06:34.642 --> 01:06:38.298
Claire, there's a blonde wig
missing from the house here.

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:41.606
I have it.

01:06:41.649 --> 01:06:43.303
I need you back here
immediately,

01:06:43.347 --> 01:06:45.871
or I'm gonna put a warrant
out for your arrest.

01:06:45.914 --> 01:06:46.915
You have
withheld evidence.

01:06:46.959 --> 01:06:48.482
You have
confronted a suspect,

01:06:48.526 --> 01:06:50.006
and now he is dead.

01:06:51.137 --> 01:06:52.834
Immediately, Claire!

01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:55.620
Yes, sir. I'll head back
right away, first thing.

01:06:57.578 --> 01:06:59.667
Start the paperwork
for a warrant.

01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:04.933
Can't be.

01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:29.480
Oh, no.

01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:37.096
Tina.

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.316
Hey. I thought you were
coming to the gig last night.

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:42.449
I saw someone who looked
like you, but...

01:07:42.493 --> 01:07:43.450
couldn't have been you.

01:07:43.494 --> 01:07:44.843
You still in town?

01:07:44.886 --> 01:07:46.279
I'm headed home.

01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:48.716
Hardin was murdered
last night.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.109
Claire.

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:52.155
And I know who did it.

01:07:53.417 --> 01:07:54.374
Hang on.

01:07:54.418 --> 01:07:56.115
Wait.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.552
I'm gonna call
you back, okay?

01:07:58.596 --> 01:08:00.293
Wait. Claire--

01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:02.556
You can't do this to me!

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.992
Hello.

01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:07.126
Be at the Chandler
house midnight, Claire.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:08.823
Bring
some more champagne.

01:08:08.867 --> 01:08:13.132
Oh, bring some good champagne.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.965
You
dressed up as Jessica.

01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:22.402
You confronted Hardin, and
that's the end of the story?

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:24.796
Yes.

01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:26.406
Last night after we
spoke on the phone,

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:28.495
you just went
back up to your room?

01:08:29.756 --> 01:08:31.455
Tell the truth,
Claire.

01:08:31.497 --> 01:08:32.934
Hardin was murdered
last night.

01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:34.979
I need to know whether or
not you have an alibi.

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:41.291
Vivian, this is
completely unacceptable.

01:08:41.334 --> 01:08:43.728
I'm turning this entire thing
over to the County Supervisors.

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:44.946
They'll love
to hear how Claire

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.296
solved a case
that you couldn't.

01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:48.993
But she didn't solve it.
Did you, Claire?

01:08:49.037 --> 01:08:50.996
Hardin killed Jessica.
Who killed Hardin?!

01:08:52.345 --> 01:08:53.912
I don't know.

01:08:55.042 --> 01:08:56.654
Where were you
last night?

01:08:56.697 --> 01:08:58.176
Did you kill Hardin? John, I don't like

01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.613
the tenor of
this conversation.

01:08:59.657 --> 01:09:00.832
If you're accusing
Claire of something,

01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:02.225
then she needs
a lawyer here.

01:09:02.268 --> 01:09:03.965
I want the truth.
Don't you want the truth?

01:09:05.576 --> 01:09:07.185
You don't have
to say anything.

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:11.059
Claire, what else
do you know?

01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:41.628
It's nice
to finally be back.

01:10:41.672 --> 01:10:45.893
You've kept the place up
so nicely.

01:10:53.074 --> 01:10:54.641
Jessica.

01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:57.862
The white orchid.

01:10:57.905 --> 01:11:00.386
That was a nice touch.

01:11:01.735 --> 01:11:03.694
I'm so glad
to finally meet someone

01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:06.174
who understands how much
work this all is.

01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:22.234
Finally,
a worthy adversary.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:25.324
But you cost me $500,000
in that suitcase.

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:28.501
That was your mistake,
not mine.

01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:30.721
Why did you
leave that behind?

01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:34.290
I leave money
many places...

01:11:35.856 --> 01:11:37.684
in case I need it
in a hurry.

01:11:37.728 --> 01:11:40.948
This isn't the first time
you've done this.

01:11:43.037 --> 01:11:45.213
And it won't
be the last.

01:11:47.564 --> 01:11:49.000
Hmm.

01:11:49.043 --> 01:11:50.741
Dr. Hardin was very good.

01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:53.352
I can't tell
you've had any work done.

01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:56.137
Barry was an artist.

01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:06.757
Hmm.

01:12:15.592 --> 01:12:17.637
Chin implant?

01:12:24.992 --> 01:12:26.646
You're a natural beauty,
Claire.

01:12:28.213 --> 01:12:32.652
Some of us,
we need work.

01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:35.525
I just love the way you
confronted Barry at the Rex.

01:12:35.568 --> 01:12:36.526
You were incredible.

01:12:36.569 --> 01:12:39.180
That look
on his face,

01:12:39.224 --> 01:12:41.313
I live for moments
like that.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.315
You killed him.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:48.189
You'd be amazed at what people
will do for money, Claire.

01:12:48.233 --> 01:12:52.542
You can hire someone
to do anything.

01:12:52.585 --> 01:12:56.023
You've planned everything
so meticulously,

01:12:56.067 --> 01:12:57.329
every last detail.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:13:00.376
Well, that's how
it works, Claire.

01:13:00.419 --> 01:13:03.204
I don't get caught.

01:13:03.248 --> 01:13:05.293
That wouldn't
be any fun.

01:13:07.818 --> 01:13:11.561
I always have
an escape plan, always,

01:13:11.604 --> 01:13:14.346
so just when you think
you've got me,

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.740
think again.

01:13:31.624 --> 01:13:32.669
Ah.

01:13:42.287 --> 01:13:44.942
Do you even remember
this little girl?

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:47.292
She doesn't matter.

01:13:47.335 --> 01:13:49.816
She doesn't matter.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:52.471
This time tomorrow,
I'll be somewhere else.

01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:54.778
I'll be someone else.

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.911
So...

01:13:57.955 --> 01:14:00.348
is it all
just about the money?

01:14:00.392 --> 01:14:02.133
Not the money, the game,

01:14:02.176 --> 01:14:04.222
the sex.

01:14:04.265 --> 01:14:07.486
But I must say,
that woman...

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:11.838
at the Rex
last night, Bianca,

01:14:11.882 --> 01:14:14.058
she was stunning.

01:14:14.101 --> 01:14:16.669
Is there anything
that you don't know?

01:14:16.713 --> 01:14:20.151
To be honest, I'm not
exactly sure what you know.

01:14:20.194 --> 01:14:22.632
Would you like me to lay
it all out for you?

01:14:22.675 --> 01:14:25.373
Allow me.

01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:27.027
Ah.

01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:30.466
You research.

01:14:30.509 --> 01:14:33.512
You find a prominent
and wealthy plastic surgeon,

01:14:33.556 --> 01:14:35.296
Dr. Barry Hardin.

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:38.082
You arrange to have
some minor work done,

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:40.650
and you lure him
into an affair.

01:14:42.913 --> 01:14:47.744
But a man can't
just murder his wife.

01:14:47.787 --> 01:14:50.573
She has to disappear
in plain sight.

01:14:52.052 --> 01:14:54.838
I am so enjoying this.

01:14:56.796 --> 01:14:59.233
Hardin does
more work on you,

01:14:59.277 --> 01:15:02.367
just enough to make you
look like Sylvia,

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:05.675
the nose,
the larger breasts,

01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:09.896
so that with a wig and her
beauty mark and her clothes,

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.552
you could
easily pass for her.

01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.772
After you heal up,
you move away

01:15:15.815 --> 01:15:19.558
to a small town
like Morro Bay,

01:15:19.602 --> 01:15:24.650
and you establish yourself as
the mysterious Juliette Towne.

01:15:27.392 --> 01:15:30.438
Three months later,
according to your plan,

01:15:30.482 --> 01:15:33.137
Hardin murders his wife,

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:36.706
and that night, it's time
for Juliette Towne to disappear,

01:15:36.749 --> 01:15:42.712
but before you go, you meticulously
clean this entire house,

01:15:42.755 --> 01:15:45.584
and you leave behind
Sylvia Hardin's hairbrushes

01:15:45.628 --> 01:15:49.153
and her toothbrushes,
her DNA.

01:15:49.196 --> 01:15:51.372
That way,
the Sheriff's Department

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.984
connects that mutilated body
on the beach

01:15:54.027 --> 01:15:59.642
with Juliette Towne, the mysterious
woman who lived in this house.

01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:01.948
Not only does
the DNA match,

01:16:01.992 --> 01:16:04.560
but now Juliette Towne
has disappeared.

01:16:06.126 --> 01:16:08.564
But the truth is...

01:16:12.655 --> 01:16:16.223
that the body on the beach,
Juliette Towne,

01:16:16.267 --> 01:16:19.966
the body known
as the White Orchid,

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:22.142
is really Sylvia Hardin.

01:16:23.448 --> 01:16:27.191
And then, three days later,

01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:31.543
on that South Seas cruise
that's been booked for weeks,

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:34.764
that Sylvia must have told
all her friends about,

01:16:34.807 --> 01:16:37.244
you board the ship
with Hardin.

01:16:37.288 --> 01:16:40.073
The two of you lay low
for a couple of days,

01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:43.468
and then you go for drinks
one night in the ship's bar.

01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:46.993
You get into a fight just loud
enough for other people to hear.

01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:50.562
You leave the bar.
Hardin stays there behind,

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:55.654
and you make sure that people
see you crying by the railing,

01:16:55.698 --> 01:16:58.004
but then
when no one's looking,

01:16:58.048 --> 01:17:00.006
you break the glass.

01:17:01.965 --> 01:17:04.620
Poor Sylvia Hardin.

01:17:04.663 --> 01:17:06.143
She's disappeared.

01:17:06.186 --> 01:17:08.493
She jumped.
Maybe she fell.

01:17:08.536 --> 01:17:10.321
It doesn't matter.

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:12.453
She's gone.

01:17:12.497 --> 01:17:14.151
Bon voyage.

01:17:16.109 --> 01:17:18.851
You're supposed to meet back
up with Hardin, but you don't,

01:17:18.895 --> 01:17:22.333
and I don't know where you've
been for the last six months,

01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:26.337
but you've blackmailed Hardin
for everything he's worth,

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.555
and here we are.

01:17:27.599 --> 01:17:30.515
The story
comes to a close.

01:17:30.558 --> 01:17:32.778
It's time for you
to disappear again.

01:17:34.171 --> 01:17:39.785
You don't know
just how close you are.

01:17:43.354 --> 01:17:44.921
You confess?

01:17:52.885 --> 01:17:56.802
It's not the crime that's the
hard part, is it, Claire?

01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:01.285
It's the getting away,

01:18:01.328 --> 01:18:03.200
the disappearing.

01:18:06.551 --> 01:18:09.989
Why did you risk
coming here tonight?

01:18:10.033 --> 01:18:14.080
Came here to meet
the great Claire Decker

01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:16.517
and to thank you.

01:18:16.561 --> 01:18:20.957
I'll need to be much
more careful next time.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.089
What makes you think
that I'm gonna let you go?

01:18:23.133 --> 01:18:25.396
I knew if you
showed up here tonight,

01:18:25.439 --> 01:18:26.876
you'd let me go.

01:18:28.965 --> 01:18:34.884
And besides, well, I've
let you go, haven't I?

01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:39.540
I mean, if I wanted to,

01:18:39.584 --> 01:18:41.368
you'd be dead by now.

01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.556
You're not
gonna shoot me, Claire.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:00.518
You're gonna let me walk
right out that front door.

01:19:09.396 --> 01:19:10.963
Do you know why?

01:19:14.619 --> 01:19:17.361
Because you and I...

01:19:18.623 --> 01:19:22.409
we're
the same person.

01:19:40.732 --> 01:19:42.429
You're not Jessica.

01:19:50.437 --> 01:19:52.135
Until we meet again.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:05.278
Adios.

01:20:18.074 --> 01:20:20.337
That's a direct order.
Do it now.

01:20:24.689 --> 01:20:26.473
The suspect
is in custody.

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.827
It's all clear.

01:20:44.578 --> 01:20:45.710
Go through the house,

01:20:45.753 --> 01:20:47.190
and secure
the backyard, okay?

01:20:53.936 --> 01:20:55.851
Are you okay, Claire?

01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:00.290
Something's not right.

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:01.987
We heard everything.
We got it all.

01:21:04.033 --> 01:21:06.339
It was way too easy.

01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:20.136
Claire.

01:22:29.248 --> 01:22:30.989
She likes you.

01:22:31.033 --> 01:22:32.817
She's a cool kid.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.950
She's at that age where
she doesn't like anybody.

01:22:34.993 --> 01:22:37.387
Hey, Daddy, check it out!

01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:40.346
You guys have
an amazing relationship.

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:41.608
Thank you.

01:22:41.652 --> 01:22:43.567
We're best friends.

01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:45.308
That's awesome!

01:22:49.181 --> 01:22:51.836
What's up with the case?

01:22:51.879 --> 01:22:56.014
Oh, um, there was a break-in
at the house last night.

01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:59.365
Somebody stole the white orchid
out of the window.

01:22:59.409 --> 01:23:00.976
No way.

01:23:03.413 --> 01:23:05.502
I'm surprised
it lasted this long.

01:23:18.123 --> 01:23:19.777
Shoo. Get outta here.

01:23:20.908 --> 01:23:22.606
Be right back.

01:23:22.649 --> 01:23:23.607
Hello.

01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:25.565
Claire, you were right.

01:23:26.871 --> 01:23:29.613
It was too easy.

01:23:29.656 --> 01:23:32.050
This morning,
Jessica confessed.

01:23:32.094 --> 01:23:35.053
Jessica confessed
to being Sarah Richards,

01:23:35.097 --> 01:23:36.750
an actress from Los Angeles.

01:23:36.794 --> 01:23:40.232
She was paid $400,000
to meet with you

01:23:40.276 --> 01:23:41.973
and play the role
of Jessica.

01:23:44.236 --> 01:23:46.456
She even had
plastic surgery done.

01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:53.637
She had an earpiece.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.987
We found it
in the patrol car.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.945
Someone very nearby
was coaching her.

01:24:03.908 --> 01:24:05.997
Claire, are you there?

01:24:10.132 --> 01:24:11.307
Claire?

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.918
The White Orchid
is still out there.

01:24:16.094 --> 01:24:18.314
She did have an escape plan.

01:24:22.927 --> 01:24:25.886
A good friend
of mine used to say,

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:28.454
"Don't cry
because it's over.

01:24:28.498 --> 01:24:30.717
Smile because it happened."
