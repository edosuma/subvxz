00:37.420 --> 00:39.229
<i>It has been nine full moons.</i>

00:39.580 --> 00:43.187
<i>We have hunted it to the north
and along the eastern border.</i>

00:43.940 --> 00:48.150
<i>Eight of the king's most honorable men
have given their lives during this quest.</i>

00:48.660 --> 00:51.948
<i>Their bodies so mangled,
they'll barely be accepted to the heavens.</i>

00:53.620 --> 00:56.669
<i>It's coming.
I feel the thunder of its wings.</i>

00:57.180 --> 00:58.784
<i>The air grows hotter.</i>

01:00.300 --> 01:02.460
<i>We cannot take another loss.</i>

01:02.540 --> 01:04.747
<i>Now is the time to end this.</i>

01:07.860 --> 01:10.864
Steel yourselves, men.
Stay in formation.

01:13.220 --> 01:14.460
Where is it?

01:15.140 --> 01:17.382
- It's playing games with us.
- Steady yourself, Richard.

01:18.740 --> 01:21.744
This infernal beast's demise
has eluded us for too long.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.503
I am ready for you.

01:29.860 --> 01:31.021
Stay in rank.

01:31.380 --> 01:32.825
I will even the score.

01:33.300 --> 01:34.791
Enough, James.

01:40.820 --> 01:42.424
Here it comes.

01:53.900 --> 01:54.708
Forward.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.340
- With your permission, sir, I will lead.
- Wait for it.

01:57.420 --> 01:59.229
You have a death wish, Thomas.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.905
Not yet. Wait until it exposes its weak spot.

02:04.460 --> 02:05.951
Now!

02:12.340 --> 02:13.421
Defensive positions.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.628
- It knows what we're trying to do.
- Hold it together, James.

02:32.780 --> 02:33.941
Draw it in.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.821
- I will make a strike.
- Back in rank. That's an order.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.021
Fall back.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.304
That was a foolish move.
He knew better than that.

02:54.020 --> 02:55.829
It's heading back to the west.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.706
And so should we.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.223
Do you think the dragon
will return to the kingdom?

03:40.220 --> 03:43.140
We chased it from one side
of our land to the next.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.905
It has ravaged our numbers down to just us.

03:46.780 --> 03:50.671
How can just three knights slay that beast?
And what of the kingdom?

03:51.020 --> 03:53.100
The king's army will protect the kingdom.

03:53.180 --> 03:55.900
Who'll lead the army if none
of us are left to lead them?

03:55.980 --> 03:57.789
We're not irreplaceable, my old friend.

03:58.940 --> 04:01.625
Our numbers may have dwindled,
but have tested it.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.620
We found its weakness
and we could've beaten it today.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.101
It was only if James hadn't broken rank.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.020
But he did.

04:09.100 --> 04:12.991
His courage and desire to protect
his brothers led him to his death.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.507
- Nobody can have such luck.
- With honor.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.108
With honor.

04:39.740 --> 04:40.548
Blood,

04:41.420 --> 04:42.228
fury,

04:42.820 --> 04:44.026
dragon strength.

04:44.340 --> 04:45.148
Blood,

04:46.180 --> 04:46.988
fury,

04:47.740 --> 04:49.185
dragon strength.

04:49.740 --> 04:50.662
Blood,

04:51.660 --> 04:52.582
fury,

04:53.820 --> 04:54.867
dragon strength.

04:56.420 --> 04:57.501
Relive again!

05:03.700 --> 05:06.670
KNIGHTS OF THE DAMNED

05:07.300 --> 05:10.300
170 YEARS AGO THE REALM
OF NAZROTH WAS IN CHAOS.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.780
A TIME OF VICIOUS CIVIL WAR AND SORCERY

05:12.860 --> 05:16.220
THAT TORE THE IDYLLIC WORLD
INTO 12 KINGDOMS.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.100
THE MOST RESPECTED AND POWERFUL KINGDOM

05:18.180 --> 05:20.860
IS THAT OF ZALDAH, WHOSE KING
XALVADOR HAS ENDEAVOURED

05:20.940 --> 05:25.220
TO KEEP HARMONY IN THE FACE OF
NEIGHBOURING KINGDOMS PETTY FIGHTING.

05:25.300 --> 05:29.060
THE BEASTS OF THE DARK KINGDOM
AND THE DRAGONS

05:29.140 --> 05:34.860
HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN FOR GENERATIONS

05:34.940 --> 05:39.780
AND THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVE
PEACE IN THE LAND.

05:39.860 --> 05:44.340
BUT 9 MONTHS AGO THE DRAGON SCREAMS
ONCE AGAIN FILLED THE SKIES

05:44.420 --> 05:46.500
AND KING XALVADOR'S
WESTERN CASTLE WAS BOMBARDED

05:46.580 --> 05:47.860
WITH UNPROVOKED ATTACKS.

05:47.940 --> 05:51.780
TO RESTORE PEACE
AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF HIS PEOPLE

05:51.860 --> 05:54.940
THE KING ORDERED 12 OF HIS BEST KNIGHTS
TO SLAY THE BEAST.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.460
THE ROYAL WARRIORS CHASED
THE DRAGON AWAY FROM ZALDAH,

05:57.540 --> 05:59.980
A FIGHT OF TEETH AND BLADE, FIRE AND STEEL.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.660
AS EACH BATTLE CLAIMED ANOTHER LIFE,

06:01.740 --> 06:04.180
THE KNIGHTS FEEL A DARKNESS
GROWING IN THE LAND...

06:04.260 --> 06:05.466
NAZROTH IS CHANGING AGAIN...

08:05.780 --> 08:06.588
Halt.

08:07.460 --> 08:08.348
Who goes there?

08:15.060 --> 08:15.868
Henry?

08:20.020 --> 08:20.908
Is that you?

08:47.380 --> 08:49.580
For a man who writes
such beautiful poetry, Thomas,

08:49.660 --> 08:52.100
you rarely appreciate the beauty
that's all around you.

08:52.180 --> 08:53.386
I do appreciate beauty.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.471
To fight with such heroism is a thing
of beauty, Thomas. You do that every day.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.740
Are you saying I'm a thing of beauty, George?

09:00.820 --> 09:03.062
We are brother in arms.
Let us leave it at that.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.831
So today?

09:05.180 --> 09:06.466
Ah, today...

09:07.140 --> 09:10.140
Today, we shall do battle
under the glorious king's name

09:10.220 --> 09:14.500
where we shall slay that beast and
turn everything right in this kingdom.

09:14.580 --> 09:18.140
The key to killing a beast
is down to its whys and wherefores.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.300
This one eludes me.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.463
It's just a dragon, Thomas.
It doesn't know any whys or wherefores.

09:25.420 --> 09:27.627
- You don't know that.
- It just kills.

09:28.980 --> 09:30.107
So do we.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.428
But something has changed in this dragon.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.980
Violence wasn't always her folly.
Something made her attack the castle.

09:37.060 --> 09:40.860
Nowhere else in our kingdom
nor in our neighbor's kingdoms.

09:41.820 --> 09:43.629
I've chased down many beasts before.

09:43.860 --> 09:46.540
Every one gave up their secrets
before they died.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.588
Not all of your women were beasts, Thomas.

09:49.860 --> 09:52.705
But each one of them gave up
their secrets. That's for sure.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.629
But this dragon, it was
a peaceful sort before all of this.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.949
It stayed away from populated areas.

10:00.980 --> 10:03.060
And now it seems this particular one

10:03.140 --> 10:06.383
wants a bite out of the powerful king
and the kingdom itself.

10:06.980 --> 10:08.744
You know, I admire it.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.869
I admire it for evading death.

10:12.860 --> 10:15.864
There aren't many dragons
and all they have are adversaries.

10:16.020 --> 10:18.580
Surely, its strength
and its will to survive will fade

10:18.660 --> 10:20.540
and solitude will kill it for us.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.022
It will survive alone,
until in battle it dies alone.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.191
That is the king's orders.

10:29.380 --> 10:30.586
We must make haste.

10:31.900 --> 10:35.260
We have a quest to fulfill
and we are down to just three.

10:35.340 --> 10:38.220
- Are you keen to do battle, George?
- Keen to keep order.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.190
- That means battle.
- You remind me of when you were a child.

10:41.980 --> 10:45.587
Always the first to battle
and always against the bigger boys.

10:45.860 --> 10:48.020
They were trying to steal
your mother's bread.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.864
You nearly killed the poor wretches.

10:50.540 --> 10:52.941
- You had my back.
- How could I not?

10:53.900 --> 10:55.660
Do you ever think of the kingdom?

10:55.740 --> 10:59.267
Not as much as I used to from whence
we began these adventures.

11:00.180 --> 11:01.910
King's orders will take us
on the righteous path.

11:12.780 --> 11:15.465
Be quick with the water.
I'll be with your horses.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.309
I know you're tired, old friend.

11:45.460 --> 11:46.825
It's nearly over.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.791
Yeah, I miss her, too.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.061
What happened?

14:54.540 --> 14:55.541
Water demons.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.550
- You?
- White wolf.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.341
How did you escape?

15:02.420 --> 15:04.946
Unseen archers in the woods somewhere.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.746
Ours erupted from the forest,
killing the beasts.

15:09.460 --> 15:10.302
Let's move.

15:12.140 --> 15:14.825
This is dark magic, George, the darkest.

15:15.940 --> 15:17.146
Pull yourself together, Thomas.

15:18.100 --> 15:21.104
We'll soon be behind
the safety of the castle walls.

15:21.900 --> 15:25.180
This, I fear, penetrates
even the castle walls, George.

15:25.260 --> 15:27.945
This is deeper, this we should have fear of.

15:30.860 --> 15:31.861
It's taunting us.

15:32.620 --> 15:35.624
It's just a dragon, Thomas,
it knows nothing of taunting.

15:35.980 --> 15:38.984
It does. It's drawing us out
for the final blow.

15:39.860 --> 15:41.351
Then, let's not disappoint it.

15:43.340 --> 15:46.820
If the dragon is headed home, it bodes
well for us, we'll get reinforcements.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.100
If not, we continue until
King Xalvador's wishes are fulfilled

15:50.180 --> 15:51.671
and the dragon is slain.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.020
While it is here fighting us,

15:54.100 --> 15:57.183
it is not besieging the castle
and killing our people.

15:57.500 --> 16:00.788
Trust me, both of you.
We will be home soon enough.

16:01.380 --> 16:04.065
It's been many months, we're down to three.

16:04.580 --> 16:06.981
We could've picked up
reinforcements along the way.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.382
Plenty of folk willing to join us.

16:12.860 --> 16:13.861
Gather your things.

16:16.060 --> 16:19.348
There's not many who could stay
that and still be standing.

17:00.900 --> 17:04.188
Kettlage village is up ahead.
There, we rest for the night.

17:04.819 --> 17:05.820
George.

17:09.140 --> 17:10.949
Careful.
He has a madness.

17:13.579 --> 17:17.141
A fun evening of Ale and bar fights
by the looks of things.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.388
Leprosy?
Some kind of sickness?

17:21.819 --> 17:23.345
Seek religious council.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.223
Many gods and their servants
will tend to you.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.069
I'll have some of what you've been having.

17:38.620 --> 17:42.261
<i>Hey, baby, won't come
along where the sun is shining bright?</i>

17:43.420 --> 17:47.500
<i>I promise if you do that, I'd be taking
care of you for an afternoon delight</i>

17:47.580 --> 17:50.220
<i>then she says, "Hey, now, hold your horses,</i>

17:50.300 --> 17:53.020
<i>I'm sure that we got time."
But then I say,</i>

17:53.100 --> 17:57.025
<i>"Hey, ho, I'm sure we do,
as long as I got you."</i>

18:00.100 --> 18:01.431
We need rest for the night.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.460
They're not locals, we should be cautious.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.980
I'm George Letholdus,
King Xalvador's royal...

18:06.060 --> 18:08.108
King Xalvador's royal warriors.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.060
Guards, please,

18:10.140 --> 18:11.346
warm yourselves.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.189
These are the king's royal warriors.

18:15.860 --> 18:18.864
And maybe the sun
will rise again or maybe not.

18:20.660 --> 18:22.980
Please sit. I'll bring you whatever you wish.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.108
Wine and four jugs of beer.

18:26.060 --> 18:26.902
Please.

18:27.220 --> 18:28.028
Luanda,

18:28.620 --> 18:30.031
take these drinks

18:30.860 --> 18:32.100
and warm these gentlemen.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.909
Never trust anyone, do you? Hey!

18:44.540 --> 18:47.544
Bryce, I'mma tell you,
don't you start in my bar.

18:47.780 --> 18:49.908
They're the king's men.
Yeah.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.501
Same for you!

18:52.460 --> 18:54.463
He's calling you, your boyfriend.

18:56.180 --> 18:57.784
I'm warning you, okay?

19:02.900 --> 19:05.426
Who is the gentleman
who speaks in such hostility?

19:05.820 --> 19:06.628
Oh,

19:07.340 --> 19:10.185
he's just an untrusting soul. He's nothing.

19:10.620 --> 19:11.508
What's his name?

19:11.940 --> 19:13.146
I don't remember.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.783
They ask of his name.

19:29.740 --> 19:30.741
It's Bryce.

19:34.100 --> 19:34.908
Bryce Jefferson.

19:36.460 --> 19:37.461
Now, please.

19:49.420 --> 19:53.220
Have you any more thoughts of going home,
George, since we're so close?

19:53.300 --> 19:54.506
You must go home.

19:55.420 --> 19:58.580
Oh, yes. To your mystery lady friend.
What was her name?

19:58.660 --> 19:59.866
Never you mind.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.824
The stable girl, that's it.
It's been a long time.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.820
We'll return home and the beast is slain.

20:08.900 --> 20:13.110
If the dragon does head to the castle,
then so shall we, not before.

20:14.020 --> 20:15.988
- To our fallen.
- With honor.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.785
Four of your best and a room for the night.

20:31.780 --> 20:32.781
Katori's.

20:34.420 --> 20:36.150
They're strange kingdom.

20:39.980 --> 20:41.391
Female warriors, huh?

20:41.980 --> 20:43.630
Have caution, my friend.

20:44.340 --> 20:46.422
Be careful for they'll have your tongue.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.185
They'll have it all right.

21:14.820 --> 21:15.628
Ladies.

21:20.860 --> 21:22.669
You know, I've fallen for you.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.150
Come have a drink with us.

21:27.420 --> 21:30.981
We're fine here.
But you may take a seat at our table.

21:32.260 --> 21:33.466
Here we go again.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.870
You're from Katori, right?

21:40.220 --> 21:41.028
We are.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.541
- What are you doing in the King's land?
- He's your king, not ours.

21:46.220 --> 21:47.711
But it's still his land.

21:48.420 --> 21:51.549
We're not here to spy,
if that's what concerns you.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.426
We're just passing through.

21:59.660 --> 22:00.900
My name is Dimia.

22:01.340 --> 22:03.388
Phrowenia, Kateya, Isabel.

22:05.540 --> 22:09.067
You are George and Richard of the
King Xalvador's warriors, are you not?

22:10.420 --> 22:12.024
- And you are?
- Thomas.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.704
And you say you're not a spy,
you're very well-informed.

22:16.060 --> 22:17.551
Your reputation precedes you.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.111
Wait, how come mine doesn't?

22:23.100 --> 22:24.909
You said you were passing through.

22:25.020 --> 22:25.828
Where to?

22:27.660 --> 22:30.231
I'm sure you know already, Sir George.

22:31.420 --> 22:32.228
Maybe.

22:32.820 --> 22:33.708
Humor me.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.387
We're traveling to the southern
border of the Atayan Kingdom.

22:37.620 --> 22:40.066
- You're not gonna start a war, are you?
- No.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.664
Simply to close a matter
sensitive to the Katori people.

22:44.060 --> 22:46.420
You're gonna seek revenge
on the Atayan soldiers?

22:46.500 --> 22:47.991
It is what is right.

22:49.980 --> 22:51.869
I trust your silence will be ensured.

22:52.660 --> 22:54.742
We have no war with the Katoris.

22:55.860 --> 22:56.987
Our silence is ensured.

22:57.660 --> 22:59.469
May the gods watch over you.

22:59.820 --> 23:03.427
Where were the gods when the
Atayan soldiers savaged that poor girl?

23:04.180 --> 23:05.780
Who were they watching over then?

23:05.860 --> 23:09.103
With every battle, I wonder more
and more the intention of them,

23:09.340 --> 23:11.149
even the existence of the gods.

23:11.700 --> 23:15.591
For those of us who has survived
too many battles, we often feel that way.

23:16.060 --> 23:20.543
We are surrounded by bloodshed and trauma
and stalked by the shadow of the death.

23:21.300 --> 23:24.987
But if you look close enough,
there's beauty and wonder all around us.

23:26.740 --> 23:27.548
True enough.

23:28.740 --> 23:32.791
And whilst blood still remains inside us,
it's not a time for sadness.

23:33.020 --> 23:33.828
Innkeep.

23:41.660 --> 23:43.151
Oh, more. More.

23:47.380 --> 23:48.381
White tips.

23:49.140 --> 23:50.631
Just like at the water.

23:51.220 --> 23:54.190
How will I ever live it down,
rescued by a woman?

23:59.340 --> 24:00.865
Go on!

24:18.060 --> 24:21.701
<i>Hey, baby, won't you come along
where the sun is shining bright?</i>

24:23.380 --> 24:26.620
<i>I promise if you do that, I'd be taking
care of you for an afternoon delight</i>

24:26.700 --> 24:30.864
<i>then she says hey, now, hold your horses,
I'm sure that we got time,</i>

24:31.580 --> 24:34.026
<i>then I say, hey ho, I'm sure we do</i>

24:34.620 --> 24:37.430
<i>as long as I got you now</i>

25:09.420 --> 25:12.424
When I was sitting over there earlier
and listening to their conversations,

25:12.740 --> 25:15.425
- there have been some attacks here.
- In this village?

25:15.940 --> 25:19.228
So they say. You can tell
drunk men and their stories.

25:19.740 --> 25:21.743
They call them the Fury.

25:23.740 --> 25:26.141
The Fury.
That's catchy, I guess

25:27.100 --> 25:28.227
Maybe it's true.

25:30.740 --> 25:32.231
If the stories are real,

25:32.540 --> 25:36.100
the threat to the Royal family
and our Kingdom is greater than ever.

25:36.180 --> 25:38.260
The Dragon is heading
God knows where, now this?

25:38.340 --> 25:41.344
My friend, we've been
on the road for eight months.

25:41.700 --> 25:46.024
You need a rest as much as I do.
It's just a few hours till sunrise.

25:46.460 --> 25:48.110
The attacks mainly happen at night.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.502
Shelters through the night would be nice.

25:55.460 --> 25:57.269
Are you spying on us, girl?

26:00.380 --> 26:02.269
So you wanna know about the Fury.

26:05.620 --> 26:07.748
That's right, they exist.

26:09.580 --> 26:10.581
Wretched,

26:11.020 --> 26:12.021
deformed,

26:12.860 --> 26:13.827
furious.

26:14.180 --> 26:16.860
- How do you know all this?
- I've seen them.

26:16.940 --> 26:18.749
Well, in the shadows,

26:19.580 --> 26:21.184
skulking through the darkness.

26:21.540 --> 26:22.746
And where was this?

26:23.300 --> 26:24.427
Northern Territory,

26:25.300 --> 26:26.267
three weeks ago.

26:28.740 --> 26:31.141
I rode off as fast as I could.

26:36.100 --> 26:38.546
- How brave of you.
- Are you questioning me, woman?

26:42.380 --> 26:43.381
You bitch.

26:44.180 --> 26:45.261
Back off!

26:50.820 --> 26:52.982
Would everyone just calm down?

26:53.300 --> 26:54.108
Fight!

27:14.740 --> 27:15.741
Enough!

27:20.460 --> 27:21.268
What?

27:21.860 --> 27:23.351
He went for his sword.

27:25.780 --> 27:28.181
Under the command of the King's royal guard,

27:28.300 --> 27:30.542
you will all stand down immediately.

27:31.540 --> 27:34.385
These visitors are our allies.
There will be no more of this.

27:37.380 --> 27:38.381
That's it.

27:39.140 --> 27:40.665
We're closed for the night.

27:40.860 --> 27:41.861
Go home!

27:43.900 --> 27:45.391
Go on all of you.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.225
I trust you have rooms
for us to rest our heads.

27:49.740 --> 27:50.741
Certainly, Sir.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.821
The Knights and their allies
are always welcome.

27:54.260 --> 27:55.068
Thank you.

27:55.660 --> 27:57.867
Get some rest.
We leave at dawn.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.625
Leave me alone!

29:09.500 --> 29:11.821
Restful night or dreaming of warrior women?

29:18.580 --> 29:19.980
You look rough old friend.

29:20.060 --> 29:22.745
I feel like I've had a barrel
of Galdarian wine last night.

29:23.140 --> 29:23.948
You did.

29:25.540 --> 29:26.746
Now we're all here.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.824
We're no longer chasing Dragons this day.

29:29.660 --> 29:32.664
We have to push hard
to make it to the castle by tomorrow.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.786
What if we do encounter these fury en route?

29:37.100 --> 29:39.262
We slay them as we would any other threat.

29:40.420 --> 29:42.821
Once we were twelve, now we're only three.

29:44.900 --> 29:45.708
I know.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.340
We just have to make it to the castle.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.583
There's be a battalion of soldiers ready
to protect the people of our Kingdom.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.388
We all have loved ones there, do we not?

29:55.460 --> 29:57.861
- We do.
- And what of the Katori women?

29:58.620 --> 30:00.300
I assume they left at sunrise.

30:00.380 --> 30:02.580
Eager to reach their mark
and return to their borders.

30:02.660 --> 30:06.551
We need to be cautious my friend,
there are dark powers at play.

30:06.660 --> 30:07.866
That there are, brother.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.301
That there are.

31:04.540 --> 31:08.460
In days of olde when Knights were bold
and the world was flat as parchment,

31:08.540 --> 31:10.543
we would walk around and not fall down...

31:10.660 --> 31:12.340
Your Highness, Princess Elizabeth.

31:12.420 --> 31:14.627
- Your Highness, Princess Elizabeth.
- If you please...

31:15.220 --> 31:16.221
Enough.

31:17.260 --> 31:18.068
Continue.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.180
The news I bring may not be
for a lady's ears.

31:21.260 --> 31:24.947
Her ears have endured far worse
than any news you can bring, Nicolas.

31:25.260 --> 31:26.466
As have my eyes.

31:27.140 --> 31:29.382
Very well, Your Highness, Prince Favian.

31:29.860 --> 31:33.180
Last night we had a breach of the village
boundary from the East.

31:33.260 --> 31:35.228
Three of them. They're getting closer.

31:42.340 --> 31:44.308
What would father have us do?

31:44.580 --> 31:45.388
My Lord?

31:45.620 --> 31:47.065
For goodness sake, Favian.

31:48.020 --> 31:49.351
I'm not the King.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.711
I say we wait for father's order

31:55.220 --> 31:57.905
as to what to do about this, Fury disease.

31:58.140 --> 32:00.500
Sir, your father bestowed upon you

32:00.580 --> 32:03.265
a great battalion of men
to protect this region,

32:03.740 --> 32:06.141
but you have them scattered in small groups.

32:06.740 --> 32:10.222
Forgive me, my lord, but I feel
our soldiers are ineffective in this way.

32:10.500 --> 32:15.108
- We are losing men to unseen...
- I am happy with our current strategy.

32:17.900 --> 32:21.791
Your troops will send movements of this Fury,

32:22.500 --> 32:23.706
but only to me.

32:24.780 --> 32:27.784
- But, my Lord, I feel we...
- Ah, thank you, Nicolas.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.468
You are right.

32:34.460 --> 32:35.940
No amount of Fury blood

32:36.020 --> 32:39.911
can match what sears my eyes
and haunts my ears within these walls.

32:40.780 --> 32:43.147
Do not spread the word, Darling.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.180
We don't want these peasants

32:46.260 --> 32:48.945
clambering inside
the castle walls, now do we?

32:49.260 --> 32:52.503
Our father would have already
had them inside if he had known.

32:56.060 --> 32:58.984
You have the same weakness
as father, Elizabeth.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.423
Cursed with misguided compassion,

33:02.140 --> 33:04.620
yet little shown to your dearest brother.

33:07.620 --> 33:08.508
Now, tell me,

33:09.340 --> 33:11.149
how long before they reach us?

33:11.260 --> 33:13.069
They're already at the village.

33:41.580 --> 33:44.265
What do you think about
these rumors of furious beasts?

33:45.500 --> 33:47.309
There is fear in the air.

33:48.100 --> 33:51.149
There's much talk of strange
things stalking the shadows.

33:52.620 --> 33:55.749
We've been to the farthest reaches of
the kingdom, we haven't seen anything.

33:56.180 --> 33:57.181
They're merely rumors.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.830
There will be proof there's nothing more.

34:00.460 --> 34:03.987
These rumors are of the dead walking,

34:04.540 --> 34:08.340
these rumors are of the dead
fighting with unquenchable thirst.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.864
- They're too prolific for us to ignore.
- The dead?

34:12.139 --> 34:13.665
- Ridiculous.
- Yes.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.949
In the village they spoke
of bodies ravaged by animals

34:18.780 --> 34:20.987
- and many missing entirely.
- Where?

34:21.900 --> 34:23.699
The Katori women said in the Gelder Valley.

34:23.780 --> 34:25.820
Where the fast river
comes down from the mountain.

34:25.900 --> 34:28.426
These are just stories
of the dead, utter nonsense.

34:29.260 --> 34:31.342
We shouldn't waste our time discussing it.

34:31.580 --> 34:34.264
The legend says they were dead,
now they're not.

34:35.060 --> 34:36.266
Now, there's something else.

35:25.420 --> 35:26.228
What?

35:27.020 --> 35:28.511
Something's over there.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.308
Well,

35:50.420 --> 35:51.626
that one got away.

35:52.940 --> 35:55.307
Are you sure hunting is your forte, Bryce?

35:57.860 --> 35:59.225
I'm the village's best hunter,

36:00.580 --> 36:01.468
maybe the lands.

36:03.860 --> 36:08.070
Well, from what I hear, you were
bested by a woman at the tavern.

36:10.780 --> 36:11.781
I was not.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.746
Anyway, there was four of them.

36:19.340 --> 36:21.024
Now this gets interesting.

36:22.020 --> 36:26.662
So, you were beaten by a girl...
oh, four girls.

36:27.100 --> 36:28.750
They were Katoris, Milli.

36:30.660 --> 36:31.468
Yeah.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.671
I was defending our honor,
our village's honor.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.345
They attacked all of us.

36:39.380 --> 36:40.871
And those three royal knights.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.230
They didn't just attack me.

36:43.420 --> 36:44.785
They attacked all of us.

36:45.860 --> 36:48.943
Oh, yes. I heard some
of the king's men were in town.

36:49.980 --> 36:52.062
There's nothing better than a knight.

36:52.660 --> 36:53.661
Don't you think?

36:54.260 --> 36:55.785
Men of honor?

37:01.340 --> 37:02.580
Us townsmen,

37:03.260 --> 37:04.546
we're honorable, too.

37:06.020 --> 37:08.751
We look after the people
in the villages, towns.

37:10.420 --> 37:11.421
Anyway,

37:11.780 --> 37:13.271
this is why we're here,

37:14.700 --> 37:16.191
to learn how to hunt,

37:17.420 --> 37:18.421
how to kill.

37:21.140 --> 37:23.950
You really think those stories are real?

37:24.900 --> 37:28.460
Are they not the words of those seeking
to strike fear into our heart?

37:28.540 --> 37:29.985
Listen to me, Milli.

37:30.260 --> 37:31.421
They are real.

37:32.780 --> 37:34.589
And that is why we're here.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.666
I don't know how many of them there are

37:40.380 --> 37:42.189
I've come for them.

37:45.580 --> 37:46.991
I need you to be ready.

37:49.260 --> 37:50.751
Why else did we come?

38:10.260 --> 38:13.389
That's big. What are you gonna do about it?

38:15.460 --> 38:16.461
Not me.

38:20.060 --> 38:21.061
You.

38:25.100 --> 38:26.830
Aim for the heart.

38:27.660 --> 38:28.866
Right beneath the shoulder.

38:30.140 --> 38:31.949
What if I can't kill it?

38:34.580 --> 38:35.468
I'll finish him.

38:37.340 --> 38:39.500
Just make sure you get a good strike.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.460
I don't think I can kill something.

38:41.540 --> 38:43.031
That's exactly why we're here.

38:44.260 --> 38:46.945
You need to learn how to take a life.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.303
How to survive what is coming.

38:56.220 --> 38:57.631
I'll go west.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.624
I'll finish it if you don't get a clean kill.

39:02.060 --> 39:03.266
You got a spear.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.506
So, make it count.

39:33.380 --> 39:35.144
Millicent, no, run!

40:10.860 --> 40:12.066
Everything all right, Thomas?

40:12.620 --> 40:15.021
I'm good. Just worry about your own health.

40:15.340 --> 40:18.460
I've warned you before.
Waking up with a sore head from ale

40:18.540 --> 40:20.986
is better than getting something
from women like that.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.871
Did she tell you that she loves you?

40:24.100 --> 40:28.380
Love is the poison chalice of my life.
Heartbreak sits at bottom of that cup.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.861
You never can resist that last sip, can you?

40:31.500 --> 40:32.865
No, sir, I could not.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.740
You still blame all
your misfortunes on women.

40:36.820 --> 40:39.500
And you never thought
someone could understand you.

40:39.580 --> 40:42.060
- You got me an antidote?
- An antidote?

40:42.140 --> 40:46.270
I've seen your antidote. You've slept
with a different woman in every village.

40:47.020 --> 40:49.102
I don't think that's working for him.

40:50.260 --> 40:51.785
Nope. Nor I.

40:53.220 --> 40:55.020
Wish I could get me an antidote for this.

40:55.100 --> 40:58.309
We better all get some rest.
We can let him sleep it off.

40:58.780 --> 41:02.910
Don't you worry about me.
Keep your eyes open for those Fury things.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.260
I'll take first watch.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.189
Richard, you rest up.

41:08.580 --> 41:10.981
- I'll take the first.
- I'm fine. It's okay.

41:11.340 --> 41:12.944
That's an order.
Rest well.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.031
You're a good man, George.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.506
You're a good man.

41:20.860 --> 41:21.668
No.

42:01.220 --> 42:05.669
Dead of flesh and the diseased in blood.

42:06.100 --> 42:07.101
Thomas.

42:10.220 --> 42:11.028
What?

42:11.940 --> 42:12.941
Thomas!

42:15.060 --> 42:16.300
Stand down.

42:18.940 --> 42:20.749
Do not become my enemy, brother.

42:26.860 --> 42:27.668
You're delirious.

42:28.540 --> 42:29.621
You were poisoned?

42:30.140 --> 42:31.187
Wake up.

42:31.540 --> 42:33.020
This is dark magic.

42:33.100 --> 42:34.670
Thomas, wake up!

42:50.660 --> 42:52.460
George, what are you doing?

42:52.540 --> 42:53.746
What am I doing?

42:54.140 --> 42:55.870
- Brother.
- Brother.

42:56.380 --> 42:57.586
Yes, brother.

42:58.580 --> 43:02.665
You were sleepwalking again,
only this time fighting as well.

43:03.220 --> 43:05.700
For the love of God, you almost killed me.

43:06.260 --> 43:09.662
I did? I'm sorry.
I didn't... I mean, I had no...

43:09.940 --> 43:13.308
Just then when you were asleep,
what were you dreaming of?

43:13.860 --> 43:17.420
I don't know. I woke up
to see his blade pointed at me.

43:17.500 --> 43:18.706
Come on, man. Think.

43:19.100 --> 43:22.104
A rush of things,
violence for the most of it.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.903
But I dream about violence most nights.

43:25.660 --> 43:28.060
This is why your nights are so disturbed.

43:28.140 --> 43:30.780
You have to come to peace
with the things we see.

43:30.860 --> 43:32.220
It was different.

43:32.300 --> 43:33.586
I felt anger.

43:35.140 --> 43:38.303
I often see violence,
but I never feel angry in life.

43:38.980 --> 43:40.186
I don't carry hatred.

43:40.340 --> 43:43.583
I know we all serve a purpose
regardless of who we hurt.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.662
There's always belief in what we do.

43:47.780 --> 43:50.060
We all believe
that what we're doing is right.

43:50.140 --> 43:52.060
So, I can't hate even enemies.

43:52.140 --> 43:55.986
But this time, real anger
coursed through my veins, hatred.

43:57.340 --> 43:58.831
I think you've been poisoned.

43:59.740 --> 44:02.700
Maybe the Katori women
weren't as friendly as we first thought.

44:02.780 --> 44:05.140
Maybe all this talk of creatures and Fury

44:05.220 --> 44:07.100
was about distracting us
from their true intentions.

44:07.180 --> 44:08.944
Maybe they were of poisonous intent.

44:09.300 --> 44:11.580
But the story of the Fury
came from the villagers.

44:11.660 --> 44:14.584
It's passed. Whatever was
in my blood has passed, George.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.108
I feel fine.

44:17.700 --> 44:18.508
Come on.

44:22.300 --> 44:24.462
I'll keep this just for now.

44:42.660 --> 44:44.822
I haven't seen that dragon for a while.

44:45.100 --> 44:48.661
- Do you think he's reached the castle?
- I pray that it hasn't.

44:50.860 --> 44:53.306
The final push.
You're gonna make it?

44:58.940 --> 45:01.944
Something's wrong.
There is a dark magic in the air.

45:03.860 --> 45:04.668
Let's move.

45:22.820 --> 45:24.823
- Help!
- Help us.

45:25.300 --> 45:26.540
Open the gate!

45:33.860 --> 45:37.380
You have locked them out there to die.
Those creatures are out there!

45:37.460 --> 45:39.861
There will be untold pain upon this land!

45:41.700 --> 45:46.706
Your love for the people
is why father favors you to replace him.

45:47.380 --> 45:51.021
Yet his wisdom doesn't seem to understand

45:51.380 --> 45:54.350
people are not as important as their leaders.

45:54.700 --> 45:57.670
There are no leaders
without people, you fool.

45:59.180 --> 46:02.263
Dare to call me a fool again, sister,

46:02.420 --> 46:06.505
and I will punish you in ways
that your mind does not comprehend.

46:07.060 --> 46:09.980
I am the first born, the son of the king.

46:10.060 --> 46:11.425
I, alone,

46:12.100 --> 46:15.100
will rule this kingdom
upon our father's passing.

46:15.180 --> 46:17.831
You had better get used
to serving me, sister,

46:19.940 --> 46:22.625
in the ways your king will see fit.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.308
Yes, my lord.

46:31.140 --> 46:32.141
Come, Nicolas.

46:32.780 --> 46:34.271
We have work to do.

47:07.260 --> 47:09.866
We're going on foot and with caution.

47:51.180 --> 47:52.386
What's happened here?

47:53.460 --> 47:54.666
Where are the villagers?

47:54.940 --> 47:56.146
Where are the soldiers?

49:11.060 --> 49:12.869
Could the dragon have done this?

49:13.620 --> 49:15.111
There would be more damage.

49:16.340 --> 49:18.468
Maybe they fled to the safety of the castle.

49:33.820 --> 49:37.142
Whatever happened here,
our priority is the royal family.

49:38.020 --> 49:40.182
Let's get out of here
before something bad happens.

49:54.100 --> 49:55.909
I guess the stories were true.

50:17.980 --> 50:20.426
Looks like we're heading
for a pretty good fight.

50:20.700 --> 50:23.385
When have we not?
This is just another day.

50:24.180 --> 50:25.420
Take them.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.420
Better get on your feet, old friend.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.662
Come on, we can't carry you and fight.

52:54.140 --> 52:55.949
I'm fit to fight, my friend.

52:56.580 --> 52:57.786
Nothing can stop me.

53:06.580 --> 53:07.786
What of the horse?

53:08.620 --> 53:09.826
We can't go back.

53:19.460 --> 53:20.461
Curious.

53:29.580 --> 53:30.786
They're just beasts.

53:39.300 --> 53:40.301
Hard to kill.

53:42.180 --> 53:43.989
How far does this fury spread?

54:07.460 --> 54:08.660
Richard, get him up.

54:08.740 --> 54:10.265
I'm fine.

54:12.620 --> 54:14.429
Come on, on your feet, Thomas.

54:43.300 --> 54:45.820
Saved you again.
It's becoming a habit.

54:45.900 --> 54:46.981
Yeah. It is.

54:47.660 --> 54:50.220
You said you were going to the border.

54:50.300 --> 54:53.300
We were overrun by these Fury.
They've cut us off.

54:53.380 --> 54:54.871
They're coming from all directions.

54:55.460 --> 54:57.190
They're everywhere.
Watch out!

55:02.820 --> 55:04.026
A little more even.

55:04.380 --> 55:05.188
A little.

55:06.940 --> 55:08.146
Is he hurt bad?

55:08.580 --> 55:10.389
He's losing blood.
He's weak.

55:11.060 --> 55:12.266
Who you calling weak?

55:12.740 --> 55:15.740
You haven't lost your pride
with your blood, then.

55:15.820 --> 55:17.231
Nope. Get me up.

55:20.820 --> 55:21.980
You okay?

55:22.060 --> 55:22.948
In much pain?

55:23.980 --> 55:26.300
Ask again and I'm gonna show you much pain.

55:26.380 --> 55:27.188
Fair enough.

55:28.180 --> 55:29.386
How'd you do that?

55:29.660 --> 55:30.991
It's a long story.

55:31.300 --> 55:34.304
- How far is it your castle?
- A mile or so.

55:34.740 --> 55:36.549
- May I ask that we...
- Yeah.

55:36.700 --> 55:39.704
Of course. You can seek shelter
in the castle boundaries.

55:39.940 --> 55:43.786
You better take all their weapons
from them like they took mine. Untrust.

55:44.980 --> 55:46.789
Ignore him.
It's a long story.

55:54.540 --> 55:56.429
I've never seen anything like this before.

55:58.500 --> 55:59.501
Nor I.

56:00.100 --> 56:03.388
We have traveled and fought
in every region of this kingdom.

56:03.500 --> 56:04.501
Never like this.

56:08.060 --> 56:11.180
We were supposed to meet
a contact in the Retan township,

56:11.260 --> 56:12.546
but it was decimated.

56:12.660 --> 56:13.661
Bodies everywhere,

56:14.260 --> 56:16.661
like they were ripped from limb to limb.

56:16.780 --> 56:20.387
The surrounding towns were deserted.
That's when we started to see them.

56:23.100 --> 56:24.591
We hadn't really seen them.

56:24.900 --> 56:27.585
We're starting to think
the stories were just stories.

56:28.580 --> 56:30.662
Then we got to our village, and...

56:31.620 --> 56:32.826
they're no myth.

56:34.740 --> 56:37.141
Look, I really appreciate you taking us in.

56:37.260 --> 56:39.069
Foreign warriors inside the castle walls.

56:40.060 --> 56:41.266
These are strange times.

56:42.100 --> 56:44.501
I think both our peoples will need allies.

56:45.220 --> 56:46.221
One step at a time.

56:49.300 --> 56:51.109
Defensive positions over him.

56:57.660 --> 56:58.661
Move!

59:15.940 --> 59:19.308
- We need to get inside the castle.
- No arguments from me.

59:19.740 --> 59:21.344
- Is he alive?
- Yes.

59:21.700 --> 59:23.464
- Conscious?
- Barely.

59:24.780 --> 59:25.861
Thank the gods.

59:26.860 --> 59:27.668
Where's lsabel?

59:28.780 --> 59:29.588
She's gone.

59:30.420 --> 59:31.308
Get him up.

59:46.820 --> 59:49.346
Sir, we must make haste.

59:50.220 --> 59:51.221
Prepare the horses.

59:52.660 --> 59:53.866
Where are we going?

59:55.340 --> 59:56.148
We?

59:57.900 --> 59:59.106
We're going nowhere, sister.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.940
I am... we are going...

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.182
- A scouting mission.
- Now?

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:09.260
But why would you go out there?
You never leave the castle without...

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.546
Silence, woman!

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.667
I'm sorry.

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.224
I'm leaving you here to rot

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.580
whilst I ride to safety.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.700
This Kingdom will be overrun

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.989
with a bigger army
than anyone has ever seen before,

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.508
more powerful and more destructive,

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:42.947
so that all twelve kingdoms
will fall at my feet.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.068
And Father

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:49.660
will see that I destroyed

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.947
an entire army of his

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:56.341
and get nothing but a royal finger wag.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.902
And my so-called father

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.747
would rather have you

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.225
on the throne than his own son.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.304
You are not my brother.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.344
Father needs to realize

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.709
that this time requires a powerful man,

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.345
not a silly little girl.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.820
I did not choose to lead, Favian.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.302
It's father's will and while
he's still alive, he's our King.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.829
How could you question that?

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.191
Father's will you say?

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:38.142
You think he doesn't know
about you and your Knight?

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.548
You think I don't know

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.504
when I wanted you

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.781
to lay with me.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.551
I'm your sister, Favian.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.585
Which is why

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.345
I need an army

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.861
of my own,

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:01.911
to wipe out

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.062
the nayers and take a grip,

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.028
to take control of this charter

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.344
and rip out the hearts

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.989
of those that try and deny my birthright.

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.751
Even your own father?

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.467
Everyone!

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:24.660
I will fill the streets and rivers

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:29.030
with blood of anyone
that chooses to oppose me.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:31.624
I will rule this Kingdom

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.744
and I will rule

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.542
every Kingdom!

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.590
What have you done?

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:44.508
Take that

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.984
to the dungeon.
Ensure it's locked away with the others.

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.020
Now!

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.501
And wait for me by the west gate.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.380
Now, sister,

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.781
I think

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:07.630
- we should have a little chat.
- Favian, please!

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:15.788
Thomas!

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:16.907
Thomas, wait.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.147
George, it's not his fault. He did not
betray, you just remember that.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.548
Thomas!

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:11.901
Are you sure?

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:14.708
End him.

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.101
Rise.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.100
Focus your rage.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.705
Tear their flesh

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.302
and disease their blood.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.663
Open the door. Undo the bolts.
We're the King's Knights.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.546
Open the door.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.461
Lower the blade.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.740
But, Sir, they are not our infantry.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.300
They fight with us to protect the Kingdom.

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.909
Obey my commands and release her.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.191
Never question me again, Ralph.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.020
I'm sorry, Sir George.

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.511
How's your leg?

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:35.748
It's okay.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.260
I'm done.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.389
After this battle, I am done.
I'm never fighting again.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.501
I doubt that.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.781
Where is everyone?

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.584
Let me take you to the princess.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.026
Happy to be home?

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:52.226
Everything's back to normal.

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:55.748
Sort of.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.987
She made me wait for you.
I'm worried for her safety.

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.182
Your Highness!

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:29.066
- Princess.
- George!

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.660
What happened to you? Who did this?

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.391
Favian. He's gone mad with power.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:35.987
Where's the King?

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.820
He's in the Northern Castle
overseeing mother and her illness.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.420
He knows not of what goes on here.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.260
The last weeks we have been
plagued by this dark force.

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:46.981
Every messenger we have sent out
has been killed. The villages are empty.

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.429
Favian has something to do with it.

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:52.500
He was talking of a huge army he had raised.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:53.740
And there's more.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:57.347
Father sent you on a mission to kill
the Dragon that besieged the castle.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.750
- I know why it was attacking us.
- Go on.

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.700
Favian had a dragon egg.
He talked of more in the dungeons below.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.820
That explains why it's attacking the castle.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.780
They've never come this far in before.

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.351
Mother wants her eggs back.

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.348
Where's Favian? We must stop him.

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.865
We're never gonna catch him.

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.791
Yes.
Secure the castle.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.261
How did you end up with our Knights?

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:50.665
The Fury have overrun
most of the surrounding areas.

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:54.870
Your men were kind enough
to offer us shelter, My Lady.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.660
The two of you?

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.791
There were more of us.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:01.948
I'm sorry.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.624
We have to get the princess to safety.

01:09:06.819 --> 01:09:08.420
I'm not more important than anyone else.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.867
You are to the Xalvadian people
and to the King.

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:15.269
- What is it?
- You're gonna wanna see this.

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.390
Oh, my God. The beasts.

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.151
That's his army.
How can he create such a thing?

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.462
- They'll overrun us!
- Hold your nerve.

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.541
George, they will eventually find a way in.

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:34.185
And when they do,

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.979
they'll run to the North Castle
and slaughter everyone.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.779
But the soldiers, the Xaldanian army...

01:09:38.859 --> 01:09:40.669
The army won't see them coming.

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:43.551
Even if they do,
they're damn near impossible to kill.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.340
They'll slaughter every man,
every woman, every child.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.104
They won't stop until we're wiped out.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.622
We must do something to save our people.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:53.220
Ralph, with me.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.985
Richard, food and water
for everyone else, yourself included.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.346
I'll save you some.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.660
The eggs are through there, sir.
I'll search for them.

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.231
Bring back what you find.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.265
There's only one egg, sir.

01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.069
What do you plan to do?

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.388
George!

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.100
A thousand footsteps moving as one
are heading towards us.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.340
I know a safe place for the Princess,
if it pleases you.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:13.105
- We'll never be safe, we must stop them.
- How can we?

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.740
Ralph, take the Princess to the stables
and saddle the fastest horses.

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:17.821
I'm not leaving.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.631
Dimia, Phrowenia,

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:21.547
- you, too.
- And you?

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.145
What will you do?

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:26.827
We'll distract them.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.505
Not for long enough.
You need us with you.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.301
She's right, George.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:37.464
If you order it, I'll stay and fight.
But is the one we run from.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.869
We need to protect the princess.

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.909
The Princess will be fine with me,

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.706
if you need to stay, sir.

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.786
I don't trust him.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.302
- Nor I.
- Let's go to the horses.

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:57.149
Yes, all of us.
Let's go.

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:05.987
Fury.

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:08.108
Get back.

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:10.948
Now!

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.186
He's one of them.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.540
Richard, take them to the tunnels and leave.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.660
I'll meet you by the bridge of the river.

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:32.585
- But, George, there's safety in...
- I will hear no more of this.

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:33.668
Go.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.500
What of the egg?

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.661
Leave it with me.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.980
- George, please.
- If you love me,

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.949
if you love your people, you must go.

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:52.466
What are you doing?

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:53.981
Staying with you.

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:57.823
- There's no need for it.
- I will not have you stand alone.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.343
- I owe you a life debt.
- Pay it by protecting the princess.

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.989
The road will be fraught with danger.
Richard cannot defend it all.

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.508
As you wish.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.582
I do.

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.140
Then I'll stay.

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.905
Let's see if it's safe.

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.150
- What are you doing?
- Ensuring the future of our Kingdom.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.946
No.

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.864
This is for the Kingdom.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:55.986
How many arrows left?

01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.381
I'll make them count.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.666
Hurry, Princess.
These tunnels lead to safety.

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:41.865
- How much longer do we wait?
- Until he gets here.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.342
We can't leave a King's knight behind.

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.542
Any longer and we'll leave at least one.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:53.020
I still got some fight left in me yet.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.909
I thought you were done fighting.

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:00.542
Time to go.

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.544
- We can't.
- She's right.

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.705
- He ordered me to get you to safety.
- Wait.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:14.068
You made it!

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:34.020
I thought you were gonna have horses.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.306
You're not dead yet?

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:36.668
After you.

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:40.708
I'm fine.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.188
I know.

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:49.391
Are you fit to fight?

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.629
Always, sir. Always.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:54.788
As are we.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.749
You're not going home after the mission?

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:02.386
We will soon enough. First we'll help you
get your princess to the Kingdom.

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:03.828
Your Highness,

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.385
we have to get you back to the King safe.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.151
- Your brother...
- I know.

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:14.061
It's becoming clear that the dark forces
ravaging our land are just the beginning.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.541
We must rally the troops
and protect the people.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.506
There's a war coming.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.908
Blood of the dragonlings
bring them near immortal life.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.584
Rise my fallen fury,

01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:50.343
rise my fallen soul.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.229
Feel the power of my command.

01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:57.743
Feel the rage and fury
building up inside of you.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.908
Prepare for war!
