00:25.592 --> 00:28.823
[Guitar And Fiddle Play Folksy Tune]

01:02.595 --> 01:04.028
With my personal trainer,

01:04.096 --> 01:05.530
from Tampa Bay, Florida,

01:05.598 --> 01:07.225
Tony Little,

01:07.300 --> 01:08.324
[Applause]

01:08.401 --> 01:09.891
Hey, Tony, welcome,

01:09.969 --> 01:12.904
Thank you for being here,

01:12.972 --> 01:15.406
Let me ask you a question,

01:15.475 --> 01:17.909
95% of people
gain their weight back,

01:17.977 --> 01:19.911
Is it ever going to end?

01:19.979 --> 01:21.412
We 're going to educate them,

01:21.481 --> 01:22.914
Let me show you something,

01:22.982 --> 01:24.415
what I call "fitness past,"

01:24.484 --> 01:26.076
What's all this?

01:26.152 --> 01:27.551
[Grrr]

01:27.620 --> 01:29.087
The original!

01:29.155 --> 01:32.591
Ha! I can't believe it.

01:32.659 --> 01:36.618
Ohh...thanks.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.561
This is a sign.

01:38.631 --> 01:39.962
He's always been king
of his world,

01:40.033 --> 01:41.466
We'll teach him fear,

01:41.534 --> 01:43.263
"We're millionaires, boys.

01:43.336 --> 01:46.271
I'll share it with all of you."

01:49.109 --> 01:51.543
He was a king and a god

01:51.611 --> 01:53.044
in the world he knew,

01:53.113 --> 01:55.047
But now he comes
to civilization,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.548
merely a captive,

01:56.616 --> 01:59.210
a show to gratify
your curiosity,

01:59.285 --> 02:00.650
" Ladies and gentlemen..."

02:00.720 --> 02:01.687
Look at...

02:01.754 --> 02:04.154
" Kong, the eighth wonder
of the world."

02:04.224 --> 02:05.885
[Fanfare]

02:05.959 --> 02:07.586
There he is.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.924
If only he could pitch.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.395
Good one now.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.897
Come on! Heads up!

02:12.966 --> 02:15.127
Put it in there.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.227
Strike!

02:20.440 --> 02:21.372
Hello, fellas.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.875
Well, well, the pride of the Yankees.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.377
They fly you down in their private jet?

02:26.446 --> 02:27.879
In fact, they offered. Yeah.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.381
I heard you were in big trouble.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.883
Where'd you hear that?

02:31.951 --> 02:33.384
The kid you found, McGowan?

02:33.453 --> 02:34.886
He's zero for 60?

02:34.954 --> 02:36.854
0 for 61.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.857
You didn't see last night's game.

02:38.925 --> 02:40.859
Who cares about last night's game?

02:40.927 --> 02:43.020
Let me tell you how it works.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.529
The world's a jungle.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.030
You walk into the jungle,

02:46.099 --> 02:48.363
come outwith Kong,
you're a hero.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.402
They forget about
last night's game.

02:50.470 --> 02:51.402
Who's Kong?

02:51.471 --> 02:52.529
Catcher, Iowa State.

02:52.605 --> 02:55.438
No, the animal!
In the movies.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.975
Forget it.

02:59.712 --> 03:00.701
Strike!

03:00.780 --> 03:02.839
Whew! The kid can pitch.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.349
He's gonna finish college, too.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.850
What's he now, junior?

03:05.919 --> 03:06.977
Freshman.

03:07.053 --> 03:07.985
Freshman?

03:08.054 --> 03:09.681
31 /2 years, can't touch him.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.690
Can't even talk to his parents.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.225
They're devout Catholics.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.386
Well, I learned one thing,

03:15.461 --> 03:17.395
no use salivating over a player

03:17.463 --> 03:19.556
you're never gonna get,
right, Phil?

03:19.632 --> 03:20.564
Right.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.066
If my bosses call,

03:22.135 --> 03:24.069
tell 'em I already showed up.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.071
By the way, I'm leaving now.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.073
You can make fun of me.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.699
Yeah, don't worry. We will.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.917
Tommy!

03:38.985 --> 03:40.418
How are you?

03:40.486 --> 03:41.418
Good.

03:41.487 --> 03:42.920
I'm Al Percolo...

03:42.989 --> 03:45.924
scout with the New York Yankees.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.425
Wow. The Yankees?

03:47.493 --> 03:49.927
I didn't know you guys were coming.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.429
Here we are.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.931
Listen, you're really good.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.024
Thanks.

03:55.101 --> 03:56.864
You're gonna finish
school though, huh?

03:56.936 --> 03:58.369
It's not my idea.

03:58.438 --> 03:59.871
I'd kill to play
for the Yankees,

03:59.939 --> 04:01.873
but that's what
my parents want.

04:01.941 --> 04:03.875
I thought you wanted to finish.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.877
No, but what am I gonna do?

04:05.945 --> 04:07.879
Let me talk to your parents.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.881
Want to come have dinner?

04:09.949 --> 04:11.382
Tonight? I wasn't really invited.

04:11.451 --> 04:12.884
I'm inviting you.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.886
I accept.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.892
Mmm. These carrots
are so sweet,

04:20.959 --> 04:22.894
you could eat them for dessert.

04:22.962 --> 04:24.156
Thank you.

04:28.468 --> 04:32.165
You know, the Yankees
are very geared to religion.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.432
I couldn't help noticing

04:35.508 --> 04:37.442
that beautiful painting
up there.

04:37.510 --> 04:40.775
That's virtually
the same exact picture

04:40.847 --> 04:42.747
that hangs in the clubhouse.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.451
Terrific likeness, isn't it?

04:48.688 --> 04:50.121
You've heard of Mickey Mantle?

04:50.189 --> 04:52.851
Did you know
his sister was a nun?

04:52.925 --> 04:54.859
I hadn't heard that.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.690
Yes, indeed, a very famous one.

04:56.763 --> 04:58.355
What was her name?

04:58.431 --> 05:01.889
Gee, I believe
it was also Micki,

05:01.968 --> 05:03.401
but with an "I."

05:03.469 --> 05:06.233
Sister Micki Elizabeth Mantle.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.739
Some nun.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.140
Tommy, you haven't
touched your food.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.643
I'm not hungry.

05:12.712 --> 05:15.010
It's no excuse.
Finish your food.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.413
He reminds me of me.

05:17.483 --> 05:21.419
Couldn't get me to finish my food
if you paid me.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.421
Now try to keep me away.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.751
May I say something?

05:24.824 --> 05:25.984
Yeah.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.993
I believe education
is most important

05:28.061 --> 05:29.995
and that people
should finish school.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.655
I know Tommy does, too.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.665
But Tommy has a dilemma,

05:33.733 --> 05:36.497
and that is that...
he's gifted.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.504
And he's really concerned.

05:39.572 --> 05:42.006
What does he do with that gift?

05:42.075 --> 05:46.011
Does he sign on the dotted line
right now, make $500,000,

05:46.079 --> 05:49.014
go to the biggest city
in the world,

05:49.082 --> 05:53.109
and become a member of the most
prestigious baseball team that ever was,

05:53.186 --> 05:55.120
or does he continue
his schooling,

05:55.188 --> 05:58.248
possibly trip over a book
on the way to math class

05:58.324 --> 05:59.723
and be worth nothing?

05:59.792 --> 06:04.388
But he knows that with the kind of money
you make in baseball,

06:04.464 --> 06:06.398
even if you didn't
finish school,

06:06.466 --> 06:08.525
your education
doesn't have to stop.

06:08.601 --> 06:12.401
Tommy knows that many
of the ballplayers hire tutors.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.406
Did you know that?

06:14.474 --> 06:16.908
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb,
Lou Gehrig...

06:16.976 --> 06:20.537
they all had tutors
with them in the dugout.

06:20.613 --> 06:21.545
Lou Gehrig...

06:21.614 --> 06:22.979
had a tutor?

06:23.049 --> 06:24.482
Oh, yes, ma'am. Yeah.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.814
Didn't he also have
a terrible disease?

06:26.886 --> 06:30.287
He did, but he didn't
get it from the tutor.

06:30.356 --> 06:33.553
I think he got that in college.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.719
So you can see Tommy's dilemma.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.786
Do I take God's gift

06:37.864 --> 06:42.062
and go play for the greatest
baseball team that ever lived,

06:42.135 --> 06:46.572
or do I stay in a small school
and hope I don't trip?

06:46.639 --> 06:49.472
Is this what
you were thinking, Tommy?

06:49.542 --> 06:52.204
That's exactly...right.

06:52.278 --> 06:55.441
I can have a tutor, Mom,
right in the dugout.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.380
Please, Mom, let me play.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.382
Please?

06:58.451 --> 07:00.118
Please?

07:00.119 --> 07:00.175
Please?

07:00.253 --> 07:04.383
And in his major league
debut, Tommy Lacy,

07:04.457 --> 07:07.051
What a great afternoon
for Yankee baseball,

07:07.126 --> 07:09.560
I'm Bobby Mercer,
along with John Sturly,

07:09.629 --> 07:11.563
the radio voice of the Yankees,

07:11.631 --> 07:13.565
John has seen Tommy Lacy pitch,

07:13.633 --> 07:15.567
I sure have, a year ago,

07:15.635 --> 07:17.569
We gave up Reynolds for Lacy?

07:17.637 --> 07:20.071
Sure hope it's
the right thing to do.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.073
Wait till you see him pitch.

07:22.141 --> 07:24.575
You'd give up two Reynolds
to get him.

07:25.978 --> 07:29.414
By the way, how come he's not
with the team?

07:29.482 --> 07:31.109
I wouldn't worry about it.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.118
[Vomiting]

07:35.488 --> 07:36.420
[Toilet Flushes]

07:36.489 --> 07:38.354
You feeling better, Tommy?

07:38.424 --> 07:39.618
No.

07:39.692 --> 07:42.627
Come on, son.
You got to take the mound.

07:42.695 --> 07:43.627
It's game time.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.129
No, I can't.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.166
Tell them I can't.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.167
What do you mean you can't?

07:49.235 --> 07:51.169
There's 30,000 people
sitting out there

07:51.237 --> 07:53.364
just waiting to see you pitch.

07:53.439 --> 07:54.804
Tell them I can't.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.239
I can't do it.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.674
I ain't telling them nothing.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.370
You tell them.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.208
Aagg.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.212
What?

08:02.281 --> 08:03.714
Get him out of there.

08:03.783 --> 08:05.216
Well, crawl underneath.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.218
I don't care what you do.

08:07.286 --> 08:09.720
Just get him out of there.

08:09.789 --> 08:10.949
Al.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.048
Al!

08:13.125 --> 08:15.286
Your kid's locked himself
in the crapper.

08:15.361 --> 08:16.293
What?

08:16.362 --> 08:17.727
Lacy's locked in the crapper.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.196
He won't come out.

08:19.265 --> 08:22.257
Here we go,
The Yankees take the field,

08:22.335 --> 08:24.769
Kid, you're supposed
to be on the field!

08:24.837 --> 08:26.771
Listen, I made
a mistake, O.K.?

08:26.839 --> 08:28.272
O.K. I need the Lord.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.774
What's going on?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.275
I want the Lord.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.777
He don't want to play, Al.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.278
Let me talk to him.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.508
Tommy, Al Percolo.
How are ya?

08:36.582 --> 08:38.515
Mr. Percolo,
I made a mistake.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.017
I got to go home.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.986
You can't go home, Tommy.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.887
People are waiting.
Everyone wants to see you pitch.

08:44.957 --> 08:45.889
Come on.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.392
I can't pitch
for a crowd this size.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.122
I can't do it.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.131
You've pitched in front
of full stadiums at home.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.632
What's the difference?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.133
It wasn't Yankee Stadium.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.193
It's... I don't
want to be here.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.704
I'll give the money back.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.707
I don't want it back,
you son of a bitch.

09:02.775 --> 09:05.209
Sorry, Tommy.
I'm on the line here.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.213
I gave up a draft choice
to get you.

09:08.281 --> 09:12.217
Just compose yourself, get out there,
and play a good game.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.152
No, I can't do it.
I want the Lord.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.654
I need the Lord.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.155
Shh, shh, shh.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.158
Let me tell you something.
Listen.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.660
The Lord wants you
to play baseball.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.888
Yes, he does.

09:23.963 --> 09:26.056
He wants me to finish school.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.565
No, he doesn't.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.067
God's not interested
in people finishing school.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.570
He doesn't care about
the graduation ceremonies.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.572
That's why they're
in the afternoon.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.074
They'd be at night
if it was important.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.407
So, go out there and play ball.

09:39.478 --> 09:41.912
This is what
God wants you to do.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.415
I don't know much,
but I know this.

09:44.483 --> 09:45.780
God wants you to pitch.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.785
I think I made a mistake.

09:47.853 --> 09:49.787
God says people
can make mistakes.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.789
God never said
people make mistakes.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.791
Where did you hear that shit?

09:53.859 --> 09:55.258

Yeah.

with the Yankees?

Yankee general manager.

34:18.022 --> 34:20.489
Aah!

34:27.465 --> 34:28.431
Good morning.

34:28.498 --> 34:31.400
I want to thank you all
for coming here

34:31.469 --> 34:33.027
on such short notice.

34:33.103 --> 34:36.039
But, boy, have we got
a beautiful day for this.

34:36.107 --> 34:38.632
Jesus Christ,
he's going to make speeches now.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.643
Now in my opinion,

34:40.710 --> 34:43.145
you're about to see
the best ballplayer

34:43.214 --> 34:44.647
I've ever seen,

34:44.715 --> 34:46.148
buyout be the judge.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.650
No more talk.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.150
Time to see him.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.915
Ladies and gentlemen...

34:50.987 --> 34:53.081
Steve Nebraska,

34:53.157 --> 34:54.920
right here.

34:57.628 --> 34:59.357
Come out now!

35:00.431 --> 35:02.058
Where is he?

35:04.702 --> 35:06.363
Where is he, Al?

35:06.437 --> 35:08.871
There we go, Steve Nebraska!

35:08.940 --> 35:10.874
Come on out.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.705
Check the turnpike, Al.

35:12.777 --> 35:15.371
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

35:17.949 --> 35:19.746
I'm sure.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.375
Where is he? Steve!

35:21.452 --> 35:24.250
There he is.
Just getting his shoes on.

35:24.322 --> 35:25.880
Steve Nebraska!

35:26.958 --> 35:28.585
Take a few warmups,

35:28.659 --> 35:31.059
and let me know
when you're ready.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.562
I don't need to warm up.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.063
Are you sure?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.895
He's all warmed up.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.401
I guess that's what
he was doing.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.027
O.K., now,

35:40.104 --> 35:41.901
a pitcher of Steve's quality

35:41.973 --> 35:44.703
has got to have somebody
to pitch to.

35:44.775 --> 35:48.734
Can you believe who's
going to help us out here?

35:48.813 --> 35:50.246
One of the greats...

35:50.314 --> 35:52.145
Keith Hernandez!

35:53.484 --> 35:54.416
Keith!

35:54.485 --> 35:57.010
Thanks a lot for coming.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.851
Right up there.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.356
O.K., here we go!

36:01.626 --> 36:03.059
Where's my money?

36:03.127 --> 36:04.526
I don't have it on me.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.028
I don't do this

36:06.097 --> 36:08.031
unless I'm paid
up-front.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.863
I'll give you
the money, O.K.?

36:10.935 --> 36:13.631
O.K.

36:13.704 --> 36:15.365
Steve, fire when ready.

36:33.791 --> 36:35.281
Excuse me...

36:35.359 --> 36:38.294
I, um, I don't know
what those signals mean.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.887
Then why are you shaking
your head no?

36:40.965 --> 36:42.398
Uh, I don't know.

36:42.466 --> 36:44.627
You're supposed
to shake no, right?

36:44.702 --> 36:47.398
Hey, just throw
what you want to throw.

36:47.471 --> 36:50.031
O.K., all right.

37:04.522 --> 37:06.183
Ooh!

37:06.257 --> 37:07.690
Holy mackerel!

37:10.661 --> 37:13.459
I've never seen
anything like this.

37:13.531 --> 37:16.466
How much do you
want to go on this kid?

37:16.534 --> 37:17.967
Whatever it takes.

37:18.035 --> 37:19.525
You got it.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.872
Man, did you see that?

37:32.583 --> 37:34.881
Strike 3. He's out.

37:34.952 --> 37:37.785
Keith, step out a minute,
will you, please?

37:37.855 --> 37:39.379
Larry, did you clock him?

37:39.457 --> 37:40.890
It's broken.

37:40.958 --> 37:43.893
It says 6 then 7 then 9.

37:43.961 --> 37:46.395
It had to be faster than that.

37:46.464 --> 37:47.522
That's 109.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.395
Oh, no, it can't be.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.401
This thing doesn't go over 100.

37:51.469 --> 37:52.902
See the asterisk?

37:52.970 --> 37:54.403
That means you've reached 100,

37:54.472 --> 37:56.838
then you've got
your number... 109.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.842
God damn.

37:59.910 --> 38:02.003
If all Steve did was pitch,

38:02.079 --> 38:03.512
that would be pretty good,

38:03.581 --> 38:05.572
but he likes to hit, too.

38:05.650 --> 38:08.050
I wanted to give him
the best competition,

38:08.119 --> 38:10.417
so to help us out...

38:10.488 --> 38:12.422
Bret Saberhagen.

38:13.891 --> 38:16.359
Bret, thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

38:16.427 --> 38:17.860
I haven't been paid yet.

38:17.928 --> 38:19.862
What is it with you guys?

38:19.930 --> 38:21.363
It's in the mail.

38:21.432 --> 38:23.866
Keith said I'm supposed
to get paid first.

38:23.934 --> 38:25.868
He's just a mistrustful fellow.

38:25.936 --> 38:27.369
That was the agreement.

38:27.438 --> 38:30.373
$9 million, he needs my money.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.615
Whoa!

38:49.627 --> 38:51.254
O.K. If I switch?

38:51.329 --> 38:52.796
Do whatever you want.

38:57.435 --> 39:00.004
Well, there you have it.

39:00.137 --> 39:02.071
Where'd this guy come from?

39:02.139 --> 39:05.370
The bidding's going to go
differently than you're used to.

39:05.443 --> 39:09.106
All sealed bids will be
delivered to me

39:09.180 --> 39:10.875
within one hour.

39:10.948 --> 39:13.178
How come you’re
accepting the bids?

39:13.250 --> 39:14.877
Who authorized you?

39:14.952 --> 39:16.214
Steve did.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.278
Remember when you let me go?

39:18.356 --> 39:20.881
He hired me.

39:30.434 --> 39:32.129
Yeah, that's fair.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.104
Yankee letterhead.

39:36.173 --> 39:38.164
Look at Steinbrenner.

39:38.242 --> 39:39.174
Poker faced.

39:42.446 --> 39:43.879
Ladies and gentlemen...

39:43.948 --> 39:46.382
thank you for waiting.

39:46.450 --> 39:49.248
We're ready to announce
now the winning bid.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.754
We want to thank
you all very much.

39:51.822 --> 39:52.789
Uh...

39:52.857 --> 39:54.882
I've never done this before.

39:54.959 --> 39:58.019
I'm a scout, not a speaker.

39:58.095 --> 40:00.825
I'm a little nervous at this.

40:00.898 --> 40:03.389
I want to thank
all of the clubs.

40:03.467 --> 40:06.527
All of the bids were
very, very respectable,

40:06.604 --> 40:08.037
but like a baseball game,

40:08.105 --> 40:10.096
somebody has to win,
and somebody did.

40:10.174 --> 40:14.804
With a bid of $55 million

40:14.879 --> 40:17.814
over the next four years,

40:17.882 --> 40:20.282
Steve Nebraska
is very proud to be

40:20.351 --> 40:22.148
a New York Yankee!

40:22.219 --> 40:25.313
Thank you for coming, and
we'll see you on the field.

40:25.389 --> 40:27.482
$55 million after one tryout?

40:27.558 --> 40:29.458
How can you justify that?

40:29.527 --> 40:31.927
I have to go
with my gut instinct.

40:31.996 --> 40:33.429
After what I saw today,

40:33.497 --> 40:35.556
he's worth every penny of it.

40:35.633 --> 40:37.157
So he's pitching right away?

40:37.234 --> 40:40.431
He's pitching as soon as
we get him in uniform.

40:40.504 --> 40:43.302
That's not the way
the deal was structured.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.137
It isn't?

40:45.209 --> 40:47.803
Uh, Mr. Wilson may
not be informed,

40:47.878 --> 40:51.473
but the teams were in agreement
that no matter who got Steve,

40:51.549 --> 40:53.813
because we're far
into this season,

40:53.884 --> 40:57.547
Steve doesn't want to take
any blame or credit,

40:57.621 --> 41:01.079
so he would get a fresh start
next year as a Yankee.

41:01.158 --> 41:03.388
Well, just a minute.
What are you saying?

41:03.461 --> 41:05.986
We can't play him this year?

41:06.063 --> 41:07.496
Stop taking my picture.

41:07.565 --> 41:09.260
You got 32 already.

41:09.333 --> 41:12.894
Mr. Wilson is asking
what would happen

41:12.970 --> 41:14.403
if the New York Yankees

41:14.472 --> 41:16.565
would get into the World Series?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.904
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

41:20.478 --> 41:22.207
Why are they laughing, Al?

41:22.279 --> 41:24.747
I'm going to make
a deal right now.

41:24.815 --> 41:27.249
If the Yankees get
in the World Series,

41:27.318 --> 41:29.912
Steve Nebraska
pitches the first game.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.249
All right?

41:31.322 --> 41:33.916
Does that mean I pitch
the first game?

41:33.991 --> 41:36.425
It can never happen.
Don't worry.

41:37.661 --> 41:40.960
How many years
did you play in Mexico?

41:41.031 --> 41:42.965
Steve, where do you live?

41:43.033 --> 41:44.625
Um, I don't know.

41:44.702 --> 41:46.693
Al, Al, Al, Al!

41:46.770 --> 41:48.738
Al, Al, Al, Al!

41:48.806 --> 41:50.706
All right, all right.

41:50.774 --> 41:53.174
Folks, it's been
a very long morning.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.940
He's tired.
Just give him a break.

41:56.013 --> 41:57.537
No more pictures.

42:04.955 --> 42:07.389
Put him down!
Put him down!

42:08.959 --> 42:09.948
Now, gentlemen...

42:11.462 --> 42:12.793
All right.

42:15.399 --> 42:17.560
I just want to reiterate

42:17.635 --> 42:19.899
on behalf
of George Steinbrenner...

42:20.037 --> 42:21.402
O.K., it's official.

42:21.472 --> 42:22.734
[Applause]

42:22.806 --> 42:24.706
Congratulations, Steve.

42:25.809 --> 42:29.108
Al, I want to talk
to you for a minute.

42:29.179 --> 42:30.908
Be right back, kiddo.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.418
Al, we're going to need
a little something from you.

42:35.486 --> 42:37.954
Your lawyer didn't tell you
about the letter?

42:38.022 --> 42:41.321
What are you talking about?
What letter?

42:41.392 --> 42:42.825
Before we pay him,

42:42.893 --> 42:45.418
we'll need a letter
from a psychiatrist

42:45.496 --> 42:46.929
saying that he's all right.

42:46.997 --> 42:48.931
You already paid him the money.

42:48.999 --> 42:50.398
He just signed the contract.

42:50.467 --> 42:53.436
That was ceremonial.
Your lawyer knows this.

42:53.504 --> 42:56.098
This is the most
amount of money

42:56.173 --> 42:57.868
anybody has every been paid.

42:57.942 --> 42:59.375
Mr. Steinbrenner
wants assurances

42:59.443 --> 43:02.276
that Steve won't flake out
like your other picks.

43:02.346 --> 43:04.644
I find this insulting.
This is ridiculous.

43:04.715 --> 43:07.115
Did you see him pick up
that photographer?

43:07.184 --> 43:08.378
So what?

43:08.452 --> 43:10.044
I told him to.

43:10.120 --> 43:13.055
Then I told him to put him down,
which he did.

43:13.123 --> 43:15.785
I find this very insulting.

43:15.859 --> 43:18.123
I'll have the letter tomorrow.

43:18.195 --> 43:21.653
We can set you up
with a doctor if you like.

43:21.732 --> 43:23.962
My sister was in the field.

43:24.034 --> 43:25.524
As long as they're qualified.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.537
Well, of course
they'll be qualified.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.470
I'm not an idiot.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.599
" Physicians..."

43:31.675 --> 43:33.233
physicians...

43:33.310 --> 43:35.244
plastic surgery...

43:35.312 --> 43:36.404
anesthetic...

43:36.480 --> 43:37.412
dietary...

43:37.481 --> 43:38.914
psychiatry...

43:38.983 --> 43:40.348
affiliated...

43:40.417 --> 43:42.510
"Dr. H. Aaron!"

43:42.586 --> 43:43.917
Oh, boy!

43:43.988 --> 43:46.923
Hammering Hank, yes, indeed.

43:50.494 --> 43:51.654
Hey, Steve.

43:51.729 --> 43:54.459
Save a little
of that appetite for lunch.

43:57.434 --> 43:58.366
Hello?

43:58.435 --> 44:00.027
Dr. H. Aaron, please.

44:00.104 --> 44:01.594
This is she.

44:01.672 --> 44:02.866
You're kidding.

44:03.941 --> 44:06.375
I'd like to come
see you right now.

44:06.443 --> 44:07.876
Is that a possibility?

44:07.945 --> 44:09.378
Who am I speaking to?

44:09.446 --> 44:12.677
I'm Al Percolo, and I'm with
the New York Yankees.

44:12.750 --> 44:14.684
Would you like an appointment?

44:14.752 --> 44:16.185
I'd like one now.

44:16.253 --> 44:19.188
If you're still at that address
in the Yellow Pages,

44:19.256 --> 44:20.883
I could scoot over now.

44:20.958 --> 44:22.892
Is this an emergency?

44:22.960 --> 44:24.621
Well...

44:26.764 --> 44:27.788
yes, yes.

44:27.865 --> 44:29.298
Yes, it is.

44:29.366 --> 44:31.391
I'll see you in 45 minutes.

44:31.468 --> 44:32.901
O.K., we'll waste
a little...

44:32.970 --> 44:36.462
Well, we'll see you
in 45 minutes.

44:37.541 --> 44:39.406
Fantastic.

44:39.476 --> 44:40.909
I did it.

44:40.978 --> 44:42.411
10 minutes with this broad,

44:42.479 --> 44:44.310
we got the letter.

44:46.483 --> 44:47.415
You know, last night

44:47.484 --> 44:48.917
you were really having

44:48.986 --> 44:50.920
quite a little nightmare.

44:50.988 --> 44:52.421
No, I wasn't.

44:52.489 --> 44:53.421
You weren't?

44:53.490 --> 44:55.424
Maybe it was me.

44:56.493 --> 44:57.357
Yep.

44:57.428 --> 44:59.362
Cranham Center.
This is it.

45:14.445 --> 45:16.879
What's she going to do, Al?

45:16.947 --> 45:18.380
It's like a physical,

45:18.449 --> 45:19.882
only mental.

45:28.459 --> 45:30.393
[Sniffling]

45:37.835 --> 45:39.268
Was that the doctor?

45:39.336 --> 45:40.769
Gee, I hope not.

45:42.473 --> 45:44.566
Good morning.
I'm Dr. Aaron.

45:44.641 --> 45:45.835
Mr. Percolo?

45:45.909 --> 45:47.399
I'm Mr. Percolo.

45:47.478 --> 45:50.447
Uh, could I talk to you
for a minute?

45:50.514 --> 45:51.446
Of course.

45:51.515 --> 45:52.948
I'll be right back.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.578
[Sniffs]

46:01.058 --> 46:04.186
I appreciate you seeing us
on such short notice.

46:04.261 --> 46:07.196
Before we start,
may I ask you a question?

46:07.264 --> 46:08.196
Sure.

46:08.265 --> 46:09.698
You licensed?

46:09.767 --> 46:11.200
Am I licensed?

46:11.268 --> 46:13.566
Yes, I am licensed.

46:13.637 --> 46:15.571
Would it be rude to...

46:15.639 --> 46:17.072
to see a diploma?

46:17.141 --> 46:19.302
Anything you can show me?

46:19.376 --> 46:21.867
No one's asked
to see my diploma

46:21.945 --> 46:24.311
since I began the practice.

46:24.381 --> 46:25.746
No.

46:25.816 --> 46:27.306
Yes.

46:27.384 --> 46:28.783
It's on the wall.

46:28.852 --> 46:29.784
Those?

46:29.853 --> 46:30.785
Mm-hmm.

46:30.854 --> 46:32.788
I'll take a quick look.

46:37.961 --> 46:39.394
Harvard?

46:39.463 --> 46:40.896
Whoa, whoa!

46:40.964 --> 46:41.896
Great.

46:41.965 --> 46:43.398
That's the real one?

46:43.467 --> 46:45.401
Yes, that's the real one.

46:46.970 --> 46:48.904
Well, this is very impressive.

46:48.972 --> 46:50.906
Anything with a picture on it?

46:50.974 --> 46:52.407
Is this a joke?

46:52.476 --> 46:53.909
Is this a joke?

46:53.977 --> 46:56.411
I just want
to make sure it's you.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.209
It's got to be you.

46:58.282 --> 46:59.840
You can't put up a diploma
if it's not yours.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.544
That's a felony, isn't it?

47:01.618 --> 47:04.348
Why don’t you tell me
what's going on?

47:04.421 --> 47:07.356
The kid sitting out there,
Steve Nebraska,

47:07.424 --> 47:08.857
is probably the best
baseball player

47:08.926 --> 47:10.450
that ever lived.

47:10.527 --> 47:13.462
He has just signed a deal
with the New York Yankees

47:13.530 --> 47:16.522
that's gonna make him
almost $60 million.

47:16.600 --> 47:19.034
When you pay
that kind of money,

47:19.102 --> 47:22.037
you want to be assured
that everything's gonna be O.K.

47:22.105 --> 47:25.040
They just need a couple of sentences
on a letterhead

47:25.108 --> 47:26.541
that they believe that says

47:26.610 --> 47:28.544
he's not gonna shoot anybody

47:28.612 --> 47:32.048
or run away
or throw up on the mound.

47:32.115 --> 47:34.777
Tell me again what this letter
should say?

47:34.852 --> 47:36.376
Address it
to George Steinbrenner.

47:36.453 --> 47:37.886
You just want to say...

47:37.955 --> 47:40.389
who you are
in a sentence or two.

47:40.457 --> 47:42.391
Say that you went to Harvard...

47:42.459 --> 47:44.484
is the right thing to say.

47:44.561 --> 47:46.654
And then say Steve's not nuts,

47:46.730 --> 47:48.129
not gonna run away.

47:48.198 --> 47:49.893
Good deal there.
Congratulations.

47:49.967 --> 47:51.400
Then you'll sign your name.

47:51.468 --> 47:54.403
If you want to include
a xerox of the diploma,

47:54.471 --> 47:55.904
that would be helpful.

47:55.973 --> 47:59.272
And you could put, " P.S.
Sorry about Billy Martin."

47:59.343 --> 48:00.640
Billy Martin?

48:00.711 --> 48:02.838
Just a guy he kept firing

48:02.913 --> 48:04.346
till he finally died.

48:05.582 --> 48:07.516
Why don't I talk to Steve,

48:07.584 --> 48:10.144
and then we can
talk after that?

48:10.220 --> 48:12.654
You don't want to do
the letter first?

48:12.723 --> 48:14.953
I don't think so.

48:18.795 --> 48:20.820
These smell so good.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.093
Yes, it's nice.

48:28.939 --> 48:30.702
What are you doing?

48:30.774 --> 48:32.207
What are you doing?

48:32.276 --> 48:33.709
It's a physical.

48:33.777 --> 48:34.709
What physical?

48:34.778 --> 48:36.211
Al said that...

48:36.280 --> 48:39.374
I told him
it was like a physical.

48:39.449 --> 48:42.612
Put your pants on.

48:42.686 --> 48:43.675
We're done.

48:43.754 --> 48:46.086
Maybe it would be better,
Mr. Percolo,

48:46.156 --> 48:48.886
if I spoke to Steve alone.

48:48.959 --> 48:50.392
All right.

48:50.460 --> 48:51.392
Um...

48:51.461 --> 48:52.894
I'll be right out here.

48:53.964 --> 48:56.831
I would prefer if Al stayed here

48:56.900 --> 48:59.061
in the room with me.

48:59.136 --> 49:02.970
Well, I'd really rather
talk to you alone.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.974
I know, but I would feel

49:05.042 --> 49:06.475
much more comfortable.

49:06.543 --> 49:07.976
It's his first time,

49:08.045 --> 49:10.377
and he's just a little nervous,

49:10.447 --> 49:11.880
so I'll sit here.

49:11.949 --> 49:14.884
You won't even know
I'm in the room.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.317
I'll disappear.

49:16.386 --> 49:18.183
All right.

49:18.255 --> 49:19.347
All right.

49:20.924 --> 49:22.858
Please sit down, Steve.

49:22.926 --> 49:24.359
Ahem.

49:24.428 --> 49:26.362
So, Steve, where are you from?

49:26.430 --> 49:27.863
I found him in Mexico.

49:27.931 --> 49:29.364
I was asking Steve.

49:29.433 --> 49:30.365
I answered?

49:30.434 --> 49:31.366
Yeah.

49:31.435 --> 49:33.369
So you’re from Mexico?

49:33.437 --> 49:35.371
Uh, no, I'm not from Mexico.

49:35.439 --> 49:38.374
I was just down there
for a couple of years.

49:38.442 --> 49:39.932
And why Mexico?

49:40.010 --> 49:42.877
Because it's, um...

49:42.946 --> 49:44.743
where I went.

49:44.815 --> 49:45.941
Mm-hmm.

49:46.016 --> 49:48.541
You don't remember what
brought you down there?

49:48.618 --> 49:49.550
Uh-uh.

49:49.619 --> 49:50.881
Well...

49:50.954 --> 49:53.889
uh, not, not...

49:53.957 --> 49:57.393
Baseball brought you
down there, didn't it?

49:57.461 --> 49:59.725
Baseball brought me down there.

49:59.796 --> 50:02.924
You really like baseball, hmm?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.058
Yes, ma'am,

50:04.134 --> 50:06.568
it's my favorite thing
in the whole world.

50:06.636 --> 50:08.900
When did you start playing?

50:10.607 --> 50:12.632
Steve, is there
something wrong?

50:14.378 --> 50:16.903
I just, uh...

50:16.980 --> 50:19.073
I don't like
all these questions.

50:19.149 --> 50:21.583
Do you sometimes feel
that there are things

50:21.651 --> 50:24.586
that you try to remember
and can't?

50:24.654 --> 50:26.417
Yeah. No.

50:26.490 --> 50:28.390
I guess so.
I don't know.

50:28.458 --> 50:30.926
You know what I'd like to try?

50:30.994 --> 50:33.428
I'd like to show you
some pictures.

50:33.497 --> 50:36.432
I want you to give me
your immediate response.

50:36.500 --> 50:37.933
Just look at the picture,

50:38.001 --> 50:39.434
and without even thinking,

50:39.503 --> 50:42.404
just tell me
what it means to you.

50:43.974 --> 50:46.442
It's kind of like
a word-association game.

50:46.510 --> 50:47.943
Just look at the picture

50:48.011 --> 50:50.445
and tell me whatever
comes to your mind.

50:52.516 --> 50:53.448
O.K.

50:53.517 --> 50:54.449
Who's that?

50:54.518 --> 50:56.247
These aren't actual people.

50:56.319 --> 50:59.311
Now what does this
look like to you?

50:59.389 --> 51:00.822
That guy's faking it.

51:00.891 --> 51:04.088
You can tell 'cause the doctors
don't look concerned at all.

51:04.161 --> 51:07.392
He's just pretending
to be in a coma.

51:07.464 --> 51:09.193
He knows if he opens his eyes,

51:09.266 --> 51:12.531
he's going to see his bill.

51:12.602 --> 51:14.035
He stays in a coma

51:14.104 --> 51:16.868
so he doesn't have
to pay his bill.

51:16.940 --> 51:18.373
What a great idea.

51:18.442 --> 51:20.410
Mr. Percolo, if you
keep speaking,

51:20.477 --> 51:23.640
I'm going to have to ask you
to step outside.

51:23.713 --> 51:24.907
Sorry.

51:24.981 --> 51:27.814
You know, the medical costs
being what they are...

51:27.884 --> 51:30.114
The next picture, Steve.

51:32.389 --> 51:34.357
These guys are in trouble.

51:34.424 --> 51:37.120
They look like
they're in trouble?

51:37.194 --> 51:39.719
Not yet, but when
that driver gets angry,

51:39.796 --> 51:41.229
and he's going to,

51:41.298 --> 51:43.926
they're all going to start
screaming and crying.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.194
It's just...

51:45.268 --> 51:48.760
It's going to be a mess.

51:54.811 --> 51:55.937
This one?

51:57.747 --> 51:58.975
She sneezed.

52:03.086 --> 52:05.486
Anything else?

52:05.555 --> 52:07.386
Um...

52:07.457 --> 52:09.391
she sneezed by the door.

52:09.459 --> 52:11.051
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

52:14.164 --> 52:17.258
That's Batman.

52:17.334 --> 52:18.767
Batman?

52:18.835 --> 52:21.269
Batman. Sometimes
he goes without his cape.

52:27.310 --> 52:28.242
O.K.

52:28.311 --> 52:30.245
And this is the last one.

52:37.954 --> 52:40.149
[Coughs] Fishing.

52:40.223 --> 52:42.418
Fishing...
two guys fishing.

52:42.492 --> 52:44.619
Very good.
Anything else?

52:47.264 --> 52:48.697
[Sighs]

52:48.765 --> 52:50.460
O.K., let's see.

52:51.701 --> 52:54.135
They're...two guys
fishing for trout.

52:54.204 --> 52:55.569
Very good.

52:55.639 --> 52:57.163
Yeah? Yeah?

52:57.240 --> 52:59.299
Very good.
You did very well.

52:59.376 --> 53:00.308
I did?

53:00.377 --> 53:01.309
Yes, absolutely.

53:01.378 --> 53:04.006
Hey. Ha ha ha.

53:05.215 --> 53:07.274
If you could step outside

53:07.350 --> 53:10.251
while I talk to Mr. Percolo,
then we'll be through.

53:10.320 --> 53:13.721
O.K. All right,
I'll...

53:13.790 --> 53:16.588
[Door Opens And Closes]

53:16.660 --> 53:18.924
He's got some imagination,
doesn't he?

53:18.995 --> 53:20.428
Boy, that coma story.

53:20.497 --> 53:23.489
I never would have thought
that was Batman. He's something.

53:23.567 --> 53:26.502
I'm not going to talk
in complicated medical terms

53:26.570 --> 53:28.765
because it wouldn't
do much good anyway.

53:28.838 --> 53:29.930
Appreciate that.

53:30.006 --> 53:31.940
He's disconnected in some way.

53:32.008 --> 53:33.600
It's very interesting,

53:33.677 --> 53:36.111
but his response
to this picture,

53:36.179 --> 53:38.044
the father and the son,

53:38.114 --> 53:41.049
he didn't recognize
as father and son.

53:41.117 --> 53:43.551
Almost 98% of the people
shown that picture

53:43.620 --> 53:45.554
immediately make
that association.

53:45.622 --> 53:50.150
Hmm. Let me see it
for a second, may I?

53:50.227 --> 53:53.321
I don't think that's
father and son necessarily.

53:53.396 --> 53:56.365
Doesn't that guy look like
a fishing teacher to you?

53:56.433 --> 53:58.264
Whatever.

53:58.335 --> 53:59.768
Um, in any case,

53:59.836 --> 54:02.361
his responses to
the other pictures,

54:02.439 --> 54:06.034
they were pretty much
showing confused emotions.

54:06.109 --> 54:09.545
It's obvious Steve's not in touch
with a part of himself.

54:09.613 --> 54:12.548
That's one reason why he's
such a good ballplayer.

54:12.616 --> 54:15.050
He's thinking of nothing
but hitting the ball.

54:15.118 --> 54:16.551
And pitching the ball.

54:16.620 --> 54:20.056
You should see.
Strike after strike, like a machine.

54:20.123 --> 54:21.556
It's just...
It's great.

54:21.625 --> 54:23.559
Well, O.K.,
interesting stuff.

54:23.627 --> 54:26.061
Now, do I wait for the letter

54:26.129 --> 54:29.064
or do you want to fax this over?

54:29.132 --> 54:32.568
Well, Mr. Percolo,
I feel I can't give him a letter

54:32.636 --> 54:35.696
that says he should play,
because I don't think he should.

54:35.772 --> 54:38.138
You got to give him the letter.

54:38.208 --> 54:40.335
We... We need the letter.

54:40.410 --> 54:43.345
Let me try and explain
something to you.

54:43.413 --> 54:46.849
Um, ahem, let's just suppose
that Steve has blocked something,

54:46.916 --> 54:49.851
and then let's imagine he
suddenly remembers it.

54:49.919 --> 54:52.854
If he should do that,
he could become very violent,

54:52.922 --> 54:55.356
to himself and to other people.

54:55.425 --> 54:57.359
He should be in therapy.

54:57.427 --> 54:59.054
He shouldn't be
playing athletics.

54:59.129 --> 55:00.562
He's not playing athletics.

55:00.630 --> 55:03.064
In grammar school,
you play athletics.

55:03.133 --> 55:04.566
He's playing
professional baseball.

55:04.634 --> 55:06.568
Besides, violence is a plus.

55:06.636 --> 55:09.070
You ever see those fellas?
They're huge.

55:09.139 --> 55:11.573
The best ballplayers
never had any memory.

55:11.641 --> 55:13.575
Remember Whitey Ford,
great pitcher?

55:13.643 --> 55:15.577
Know why they
called him Whitey?

55:15.645 --> 55:18.580
He couldn't remember
his real name. No memory.

55:18.648 --> 55:20.047
I could go on...

55:20.116 --> 55:22.550
I really can't do it.
I'm sorry.

55:22.619 --> 55:26.077
Ma'am, listen, I'm not
saying you're wrong, O.K.?

55:26.156 --> 55:27.589
Maybe he's got some problems.

55:27.657 --> 55:29.591
But what are you doing?

55:29.659 --> 55:32.594
He's one of the greatest
ballplayers I've ever seen,

55:32.662 --> 55:34.254
and I've seen them all.

55:34.331 --> 55:35.764
I'll work with you.

55:35.832 --> 55:38.198
I'll bring him
seven days a week.

55:38.268 --> 55:41.203
I'll bring him twice
a day if you need it.

55:41.271 --> 55:43.705
But don't deny him
something that he loves.

55:43.773 --> 55:47.265
Without baseball,
then... then he's got nothing.

55:47.344 --> 55:48.777
And then he'll be,

55:48.845 --> 55:51.780
well, he'll be the guy
you say he is.

55:51.848 --> 55:53.577
He'll just be poor, too.

55:53.650 --> 55:55.584
You would bring him every day?

55:55.652 --> 55:57.085
Every single day.

55:57.153 --> 55:59.587
That'll be an important
part of his life,

55:59.656 --> 56:01.089
his working with you.

56:01.157 --> 56:02.590
The letter's just insurance.

56:02.659 --> 56:04.889
I don't think he'll
play this year anyway.

56:04.961 --> 56:06.895
They won’t get in the series.

56:06.963 --> 56:08.897
Really, he's yours till April.

56:08.965 --> 56:11.490
He'll have lots of therapy
before getting on a field.

56:11.568 --> 56:14.002
We just want him on the roster.

56:14.070 --> 56:16.334
That's why we need the letter.

56:16.406 --> 56:18.397
You got to do it.
Please.

56:18.475 --> 56:20.909
If you promise you’ll
bring him every day,

56:20.977 --> 56:23.241
I'll write a letter
saying he can play.

56:23.313 --> 56:26.749
You give me a letter,
I'll give one back.

56:26.816 --> 56:29.751
You say he can play,
I'll say he'll be here.

56:29.819 --> 56:31.184
I don't need a letter.

56:31.254 --> 56:32.687
This worked out great.

56:32.756 --> 56:35.691
When I saw your name
in the Yellow Pages,

56:35.759 --> 56:37.954
I said,
"This woman's special."

56:38.027 --> 56:40.962
I'll call in the morning,
we'll set up the schedule.

56:41.030 --> 56:43.464
I'll come by early
for the letter.

56:43.533 --> 56:45.967
That's fantastic.

56:46.035 --> 56:48.503
Oh, wait a second.
Wait a second.

56:48.571 --> 56:50.300
I think you should know

56:50.373 --> 56:53.706
it's likely Steve will look
to you as a father figure.

56:53.777 --> 56:56.712
You know what?
It's already started to happen.

56:56.780 --> 56:59.544
I'm trying to fill those shoes.
I'll do my best.

56:59.616 --> 57:01.550
I understand, but this a father

57:01.618 --> 57:04.519
Steve might want to
put a bullet through.

57:06.656 --> 57:08.590
How's he feel about his uncles?

57:08.658 --> 57:11.491
- You know that by looking at those pictures?
- No.

57:11.561 --> 57:14.496
All right,
thanks for the warning.

57:14.564 --> 57:17.897
Uncle Al's got
good news for you. Ha.

57:17.967 --> 57:19.400
You did great.

57:19.469 --> 57:20.902
You think so?

57:20.970 --> 57:23.905
She loves you, wants
to see you every day.

57:23.973 --> 57:27.409
I don't know if I want
to see her every day.

57:27.477 --> 57:30.412
It's a good place to
let out your problems.

57:30.480 --> 57:31.913
I don't know her.

57:31.981 --> 57:35.348
She's a doctor.
Once you pay her, you know her.

57:35.418 --> 57:37.045
~You gotta have ~

57:37.120 --> 57:39.554
~ Heart ~

57:39.622 --> 57:43.388
~ All you really
need is heart ~

57:43.460 --> 57:45.052
~ If you don't have heart ~

57:45.128 --> 57:47.062
~Then you don't get dinner ~

57:47.130 --> 57:49.064
~You gotta have heart ~

57:49.132 --> 57:50.565
~ Ba da da dee ~~

57:50.633 --> 57:53.568
That's a great movie.
It's about baseball.

57:53.636 --> 57:54.568
Damn Yankees,

57:54.637 --> 57:56.070
Damn Yankees,

57:56.139 --> 57:58.073
Al!
Talk to us!

57:58.141 --> 57:59.574
Stop ducking us!

57:59.642 --> 58:01.974
Hey, would you go away, please?

58:02.045 --> 58:03.910
We're trying to eat dinner.

58:03.980 --> 58:05.242
Where's Steve?

58:05.315 --> 58:07.442
He's with me.
Now, good night.

58:07.517 --> 58:09.451
People want to know things.

58:09.519 --> 58:11.453
How about a press conference?

58:11.521 --> 58:14.752
We're not doing a press conference
like Romeo and Juliet,

58:14.824 --> 58:16.985
We'll do it at another time.

58:17.060 --> 58:17.992
What are you doing?

58:18.061 --> 58:19.255
Throwing plates.

58:19.329 --> 58:20.990
You can't do that.

58:21.064 --> 58:23.123
M-M-M-Move!

58:23.199 --> 58:24.257
Aah!

58:24.334 --> 58:25.733
M-M-M-Move!

58:25.802 --> 58:27.599
No! No! No! No!

58:27.670 --> 58:29.661
You can't do that!

58:29.739 --> 58:30.706
Are you nuts?

58:30.773 --> 58:33.970
I didn't mean that.
Don't throw plates.

58:34.043 --> 58:35.408
Please!

58:35.478 --> 58:37.343
No!

58:37.413 --> 58:39.347
No! No! No! No!

58:41.751 --> 58:43.685
I've got a crazy landlady.

58:43.753 --> 58:46.085
She's here throwing things.

58:46.155 --> 58:47.588
She'll kill ya!

58:47.657 --> 58:48.749
More plates!

58:48.825 --> 58:51.055
Oh, no, we're
going to get sued.

58:51.127 --> 58:52.253
They're gone.

58:54.631 --> 58:56.599
You got a knife anywhere?

58:56.666 --> 58:57.598
A what?

58:57.667 --> 58:59.999
- I need a sharp knife.
- Why?

59:00.069 --> 59:02.594
To cut things with.

59:02.672 --> 59:04.367
Oh. Cut what up?

59:04.440 --> 59:07.375
I like to cut my food
with a knife.

59:07.443 --> 59:09.877
We're having spaghetti.
You don't need a knife.

59:09.946 --> 59:12.642
I don't have one in the house.

59:12.715 --> 59:14.876
I'm all out...
I got some there.

59:14.951 --> 59:16.384
That's the woman's upstairs.

59:16.452 --> 59:18.682
It's not right for us
to use them.

59:18.755 --> 59:21.315
She's got emphysema.
So it's a bad idea.

59:21.391 --> 59:23.325
Al, give me a knife.

59:23.393 --> 59:24.826
What happened there?

59:24.894 --> 59:26.828
I don't have a knife.

59:26.896 --> 59:28.329
I can't find one.

59:28.398 --> 59:30.229
Oh, you know what?

59:30.300 --> 59:32.461
Use that.
That'll do for you.

59:33.836 --> 59:35.861
This is a butter knife.

59:35.939 --> 59:39.275
Yeah. A nice one, too.
An ivory handle.

59:39.409 --> 59:41.673
Well, I'm not having butter.

59:41.744 --> 59:43.177
You can change your mind.

59:43.246 --> 59:45.476
You want butter,
you got the right knife.

59:45.548 --> 59:47.982
Go back and sing.
Great. Good.

59:50.787 --> 59:53.654
I got to tell you,
I don't understand it,

59:53.723 --> 59:55.657
I can't see a damn thing.

59:55.725 --> 59:59.024
Don't use the binoculars in the house.
You'll hurt your eyes.

59:59.095 --> 01:00:02.030
For the amount of people who've seen
Steve Nebraska play,

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.531
they're talking about you.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.534
$55 million dollars,

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.036
What about the rumor he's
under a doctor's care?

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.469
Turn that down.

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:11.564
How'd they find that out?

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:14.303
If Steve Nebraska
turned out to be Jimmy Piersall?

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:15.469
Who's Jimmy Piersall?

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:17.706
Don't worry, you're not him.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.372
What did they say?

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.384
Hands down, the fastest
pitcher they've ever seen,

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.249
and the best hitter,

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.254
Mmm, what are you doing?

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:27.755
They're talking about me.

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:30.987
We're going to have
to do a press conference.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.359
Al, why? Come on, you said
I wouldn't have to pitch.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.990
Well, you're going to pitch
eventually, aren’t you?

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:40.001
If we don't talk to the press,
they'll keep coming.

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:42.731
They'll make everything up,
like the doctor.

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:44.238
But all that's true.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:47.504
That's true. But it'll
just get worse and worse.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:50.512
Next thing you'll know,
you'll be a defector.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.014
They'll have you
killing somebody.

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:55.016
That would be cool.

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:56.847
What does that mean?

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.249
What does what mean?

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.314
Well, that it's
not cool to, uh...

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:04.326
No, you don't mean that.

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.328
With the money
they're paying you,

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:09.331
you can't throw a ball
and go home to sleep.

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.367
You got to talk to the press.

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:13.800
Maybe it's not worth it.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:15.303
Not worth it?

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:18.204
It works out to
a million dollars a question.

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:20.708
There's going to be
a million questions,

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:23.211
and I don't know
all the answers.

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:25.213
I don't want to look foolish.

01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:27.215
I'll never let that happen.

01:01:27.283 --> 01:01:29.717
We'll go over stuff,
just like the president.

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:32.254
He wakes up a fool.
They help him.

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:35.290
We'll go over stuff.
We'll fill in the blanks.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:38.885
We'll give you a life
you can be proud of.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:42.324
- Shh!
- Shh!

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:45.333
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry for the delay.

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:46.834
You all set?

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:50.339
Hmm? Yeah. Uh, in your version,
did I go to college?

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:53.341
Yes. We decided that.
Avery good one.

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:54.842
Listen to me.

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:57.345
If they bring up
the therapy at all,

01:01:57.413 --> 01:01:59.108
tell them that, uh,

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:01.616
tell them it's not you, it's me.

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:03.618
If they bring up the therapy,

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:07.122
tell them that you’re
taking me to the doctor.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.782
What's wrong with you?

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:15.630
Nothing.
What do you mean?

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:18.132
I was just giving
you an answer.

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:21.295
If they bring up the therapy,
it's not you.

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.302
I'm going.

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:23.702
I'll need another note card.

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.502
Just forget it.
Forget it.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.911
...This press conference
will lay that to rest.

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:31.640
Now, uh... Oh, O.K.,

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.648
I want to give you all

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:37.049
a crack at the new pride of
the Yankees... Steve Nebraska.

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:40.154
Are you in therapy?

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:42.589
Why you in therapy, Steve?

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.592
Ohh! Time out!

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.151
Let's all ask questions
one at a time.

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.164
Then we'll move this along,

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:52.167
and I can answer
your questions.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.964
Are you currently in therapy?

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.469
Uh, nope.

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:58.666
You've been seen coming in and out
of a doctor's office.

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:03.144
That's because I'm taking
my friend to that office.

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:04.907
Who, Steve?

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:06.243
Al Percolo.

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:07.247
Your manager?

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:08.681
Yeah, that's right.

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:09.683
What's wrong with him?

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:12.687
Uh...nothing.
I'm not a doctor.

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:13.847
Ha ha ha ha.

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:15.584
Where were you born?

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:17.853
I was born in the Mideast.

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:19.258
In the Mideast?

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:20.659
Midwest.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:23.756
West... Midwest! Ha.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.767
I spent time in the Mideast.

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.427
How much time?

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:28.834
I spent...

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:31.373
six years in the Mideast,

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.873
Wait, hang on minute.

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:34.375
Are your parents American?

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.876
So far as I know,

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.810
How'd you get to the Mideast?

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.142
On an airplane,

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:40.443
I 'll call you back.

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:42.143
That's Steve Nebraska for you,

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:44.686
Very odd past,
Spent time in the Middle East,

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:47.154
hiked around Switzerland for years,
father went to Harvard,

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:48.485
It goes on and on,

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:51.049
I got to tel I you something.
You did great.

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:53.061
You know how hard it is

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:55.393
to make guys laugh
at a press conference?

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:56.897
What if they find out

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.332
some of that stuff
I said isn't true?

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:00.869
How will they find out?

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.199
They're reporters.

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:04.671
The Yankees keep going
like they're going,

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.469
we'll see this kid soon,

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:09.136
The Yankees could be
in the World Series,

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:10.577
Oh, please.

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.978
All New Yorkers are
crossing their fingers,

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:17.486
We hope Steve Nebraska's
the Yankees' gain and Cairo's loss,

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:18.986
And I'm hungry, too.

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:22.081
How could you be hungry?
You ate 30 minutes ago.

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:23.420
Well, let's eat again.

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:26.188
No, let's not eat again.

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:29.230
I got two words
of advice for you...

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:31.232
Fernando Valenzuela.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.701
He started out a pitcher,
wound up a truck.

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:36.032
Hello?

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:38.471
Mr. Percolo,
it's, uh, Dr. Aaron.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.702
I just saw Steve on television.

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:42.710
Fantastic, wasn't he?

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:45.713
I need to see you
in my office right away.

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:48.215
Meet me there in half an hour.

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.718
No, that'll be tough.
We're going out.

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:53.778
Steinbrenner's gal got us
tickets for Tony Bennett.

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:54.788
Could this wait?

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:56.791
It's important.
No, it can't wait.

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.588
One half hour, please.

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.561
All right, we'll be there.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:03.724
I just need to see you.

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:05.733
Why's that?

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.359
Hello?

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:11.429
Dr. Aaron!

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.040
Hi.

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:21.709
Mr. Percolo, I can't be connected
with this any more.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:22.808
That's all.

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:24.944
What brought this on?

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:27.216
Middle East? America's Cup?
A Rhodes Scholar?

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.587
Where's all that from?

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.592
He was worried
he'd forget stuff.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.594
We went over a few things.

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:35.096
This man is trying
to reconnect his life.

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.426
Don't make up stuff.

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:38.524
I was just trying to help.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:41.263
I think you two should
find another doctor.

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:43.271
I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:44.601
You're the only doctor...

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:45.606
Oh, please.

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.199
Don't take the letter back.

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:50.712
All right! I don't want
you around him any more.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:54.216
Let him come to therapy
by himself.

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:55.875
Oh, new rules.

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:01.782
You were the one who said,
"Stay with him

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:04.291
24 hours a day,
he might be dangerous."

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.920
I changed my mind.
You might be dangerous.

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:10.295
I'll accept that. But you won't
take the letter back, right?

01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:12.800
Oh, you know...
I don't want to hear

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:15.268
anything more about the letter.
Goodbye.

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.566
Good night.

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.642
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:28.081
please welcome
Mr. Tony Bennett!

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:31.415
~ I mean I want to be around ~

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.648
~To see how he does it ~

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:36.157
~When he breaks your heart ~

01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:37.317
~To bits ~

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:42.424
~ Let's see
if that puzzle fits ~

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:45.625
~ So fine ~

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:47.634
Wow.

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:51.002
~That's when I'll discover ~

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:53.064
~That revenge is sweet ~

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:56.311
~ As I sit there applaudin' ~

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:58.779
~ From a front row seat ~

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.544
~When somebody
breaks your heart ~

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:05.417
~Just like you broke mine ~

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:10.551
~ Oh ~

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:13.117
~Yeah ~~

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:15.996
Whoo! Whoo!

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.123
Whoo whoo!

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.960
- Good seats, huh?
- Huh?

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:24.605
You're beautiful.
Thank you so much.

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:26.265
Ladies and gentlemen, we have

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:28.105
a very special
guest here tonight

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:29.610
I'd love to introduce.

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:32.977
I'm a huge fan of
the New York Yankees.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.482
Yeah, I am, too.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.212
How much has he had?

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:38.548
A little.

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.923
They might even get
into the World Series.

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:44.425
What do you think?

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:46.961
Al...

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:48.929
Tony knows?

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.259
And right over here,
we have someone

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:56.498
who may turn out to be
greater than Babe Ruth.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:59.666
One of the great
ballplayers of all time...

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:00.902
Mr. Steve Nebraska!

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:03.944
You.

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.776
Al!

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:07.110
Stand up.

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:09.344
Come on! They love you.

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:13.147
Come on, Steve, stand up
and take a bow.

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.122
Steve Nebraska!

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:17.658
[Woman]
Stand up! Stand up!

01:08:17.725 --> 01:08:18.658
Yeah, man!

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:19.988
Hi.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.356
Thank you, Tony.

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:25.899
Hi.

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:29.636
Hi.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:30.966
They love you.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.667
That's Tony Bennett!

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:33.729
Yes.

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.367
Sit down.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.877
[Tony] Steve Nebraska.

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:41.042
Now...
hit it, Ralph.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.711
~ I left ~

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:46.755
~ My heart ~

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:48.483
Oh, God, no.

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:52.515
[Off Key] ~ In San Francisco ~

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:55.428
Steve, that's his! Shh!
That's his closer!

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:58.661
~ High on a hill ~

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.224
Oh, no.

01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:02.361
It was your idea.

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:04.406
Steve!
Come on, everybody!

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.532
- No, don't do it.
- ~To be ~

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:10.272
~Where little cable cars ~

01:09:10.345 --> 01:09:13.747
~ Climb halfway to the stars ~

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:14.747
Come on!

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:19.082
~Though morning fog ~

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:24.091
~ May fill the air ~

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.127
~ I don't care ~

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:29.790
~ My love waits there ~

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:30.957
[Giggling]

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:34.127
~ In San Francisco... ~~

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:36.136
Do you speak English?

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:37.466
Thank God.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.006
You were great.

01:09:39.073 --> 01:09:40.506
I'm not kidding.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.042
You could sing professionally.

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.372
You think so?

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:46.073
I wouldn't ask Tony Bennett
for any help.

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:47.581
He wasn’t angry, Al.

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:50.517
Nah. He loved having
his entire act taken.

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:02.663
Good night, Jennifer.
Thank George for the tickets.

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:03.663
Al.

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:04.664
Yeah?

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.667
I'm going to stay with Jennifer

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:08.168
for a little while.

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.467
It's midnight, kid.
Think that’s a good idea?

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:12.734
We're going out
for something to eat.

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:15.242
Something to eat?
You just had dinner.

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:18.007
Do you want to gain
a hundred pounds?

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.342
We talked about this.

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:21.906
I'll put in my mouth
what I want to.

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.576
Fine...but we’re getting up

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.586
early in the morning
to practice.

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:28.122
I think you should get
a good night's sleep.

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.623
It's O.K., Steve.

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:32.126
We can do something
another time.

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:33.627
Just...
Just a minute.

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:35.129
I'll be right back.

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:39.833
Listen, you got to stop
telling me what to do, O.K.?

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:43.099
I'm gonna eat and sleep
when I want to,

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:45.606
and I'm gonna practice
when I want to!

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:49.041
'Cause I'm the Yankee!
Not you!

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:51.045
You got that?

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:40.427
Hi.

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:45.166
Sorry, the laundry
room is in use now.

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:52.839
Here.

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:54.341
What is that?

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:56.605
That's a chocolate
baseball bat.

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:58.613
I got it for you.

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.478
Did you drop it?

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.483
I... I got
a little hungry.

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:06.078
Well, I appreciate it.
I'll treasure it always.

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:10.858
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:13.861
I've been going through
a lot of stuff with the doctor,

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:16.363
and it's bringing up
a lot of stuff,

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:17.694
and I'm thinking about...

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:18.698
um, the...

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:23.162
I'm, uh, uh, ahem!
I gotta work it out.

01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:24.535
O.K.

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:27.006
I appreciate the gift.

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:28.008
Thank you.

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:30.511
So did you have a good time?

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:31.511
Yeah.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.172
Did you go eat again?

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:36.051
Just the bat.
Don't leave that in the sun.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:37.709
O.K.

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:41.051
So, uh...
what'd you guys do?

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:42.715
Went back to her place.

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:44.725
Oh.

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:46.727
Did you, um...

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:51.897
Well, sorry, that's
none of my business.

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:53.366
Did I nail her?

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:55.995
Well, now that you brought it up...
did you?

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:57.561
No, I didn't.

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:59.869
If you're gonna do that...
with anybody...

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:02.172
you know to use
protection, don’t you?

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:05.509
Oh, no. Now am I going
to get a lecture on this?

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:07.515
I'm not lecturing.
I'm telling you.

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:09.517
It's a dangerous
world out there.

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.519
This is New York, not Mexico.

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:12.849
I didn't do anything.

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.855
I'm just saying "if,"
that's all.

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:15.890
O.K. "If."

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.016
[Bell Rings]

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:25.598
Al.

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:26.599
Hmm?

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:28.101
You should separate those.

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:30.764
You can't mix
the white one and dark ones.

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:33.774
The dye from the dark ones
gets in the white ones.

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:35.776
You're an expert on laundry?

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:38.642
Well, actually,
I know a lot about laundry.

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:42.115
I like doing laundry.

win the pennant.

Doorman said so.

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:12.737
The doorman?

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:15.579
The doorman is a man

some sleep, O.K.?

to pitch, Al.

we need to practice?

to wait in the car.

in his work.

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.082
Now here's Tony Bennett

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:38.016
stopping and saying something
to Steve Nebraska.

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:40.213
Everybody wants to talk
to Steve Nebraska.

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:42.222
All right, finally.
Here we go.

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.019
We're set.
Our national anthem.

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.357
~ Oh, say, can you see ~

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:53.663
~ By the dawn's ~

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:56.033
Where are you going?
Where are you doing?

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:58.095
I'm just going to
go over there.

01:22:58.173 --> 01:23:01.665
~What so proudly we hailed ~

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.540
~ At the twilight's
last gleaming? ~

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:05.545
Where are you going, kid?

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:10.073
~Whose broad stripes
and bright stars ~

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:13.348
~Through the perilous fight ~

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:15.855
Hey, I'm surprised
to see you down here.

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.357
Game time, huh?

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:20.553
Ain’t you supposed to be
on the field now?

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:22.061
They're singing the anthem.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.098
Thought I'd get some fresh air.

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:26.065
You got to play now, man.

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:28.034
You got some
fresh air out there.

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:29.570
I thought maybe I'd get

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:31.070
some other kind of air.

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:33.573
Um, I'll be back
in a little while.

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:35.074
[Knocks Over Bats]

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:38.044
I'm going to go for a walk.

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:44.074
~ Oh, say, does that
star-spangled ~

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:48.646
~ Banner yet wave ~

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:55.356
~ O'er the land of the free ~

01:23:55.430 --> 01:24:01.426
~ And the home of the brave ~~

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:03.027
Boy, what a rendition, huh?

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:05.538
Does that ever set
the stage for drama,

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:08.542
We're back with the first pitch
of the World Series

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:09.838
right after this,

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.344
Why did Nebraska leave?

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:12.846
I have no idea.

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:14.779
I didn't even see him leave.

01:24:14.849 --> 01:24:15.781
Al, telephone.

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:18.045
I didn't give out the number.

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:19.518
Hello.

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:22.147
Hello, Mr. Percolo.
This is Ben.

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:23.155
Uh, who?

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:24.555
Yeah, Ben. You know.

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.059
I work in the clubhouse.

01:24:26.127 --> 01:24:27.788
Hi, Ben. How are you?

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:29.124
What?

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.562
Your friend Steve, he left.

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:33.066
No, he didn't.
No, he's here.

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:35.694
He can't.
That's not happening.

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:37.635
Nah. No, no.

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:39.002
I'm on a phone here

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.542
that's not really something
I should be using.

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:44.510
Call me at home tonight.
I'll work it out.

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.843
I'll get a pen.
I don't have that number.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:49.850
Absolutely, and say hello
to the missus then.

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:51.215
Bye.

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:54.351
I'll be back.

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:55.354
Problems?

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:56.355
None.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.927
Excuse me.

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.823
There's some kind of stall here,

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:02.829
We're actually about
four minutes behind

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:05.991
the scheduled time
for the first pitch,

01:25:06.067 --> 01:25:07.227
I s Steve here?

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:08.735
Why would he be here?

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:10.236
He's got to be here.

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:11.237
Sorry.

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:13.206
Said he went out for air.

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.606
I don't even know
what that means.

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:21.048
Let me borrow the binoculars.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.140
Quickly.

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:32.023
Oh, my God.

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:35.290
I took this Kong thing too far.

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:38.756
What?

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:40.323
All right, guys, hold it down,

01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:41.732
Just one at a time,

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.236
He's up on the roof?

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:44.737
What is he doing?

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.239
Who's idea was it

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:49.003
to put Steve Nebraska
up on the roof?

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:50.009
The roof?

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:51.943
Was it your idea?

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:54.004
I don't think
the stadium crowd’s yet aware

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:55.049
of this dramatic...

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:02.078
Where are you going?

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.591
To see Steve Nebraska.
He's on the roof.

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.524
What's going on?

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:08.027
It's like a fancy entrance.

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:10.690
He's coming to the mound
from the roof.

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:13.199
What will they do,
send a helicopter?

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:14.200
Yes.

01:26:14.269 --> 01:26:16.203
That's exactly
what they're doing.

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:18.739
Get the chopper
ready, will you?

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:20.740
I don't know anything
about a chopper.

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:23.436
Call Steinbrenner.
He'll take care of it.

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:26.036
Sure. Send it up.
It's a brilliant idea.

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:28.548
It's the way it ought to be.

01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:31.551
They're going to bring
Steve down to the mound

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:33.553
in my helicopter from the roof.

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.054
You can't do that.

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:37.250
It's show biz.
God, I love it.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:51.965
Steve.

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:55.600
Hey, Al.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:59.711
What are you doing, Steve?

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:04.017
Uh, I just, um...

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:05.518
I was, uh...

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:08.021
I needed a little fresh air.

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:10.080
I was feeling claustrophobic.

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:13.389
You were feeling claustrophobic
out on the field?

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:19.032
This is what George Steinbrenner
brings to the Yankees,

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.829
a real sense of excitement,

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:23.336
Can you believe this?
What an entrance,

01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:25.167
You got to hand it to the guy,

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.673
Most teams bring their pitchers

01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:28.299
in those silly golf carts,

01:27:28.376 --> 01:27:30.276
but not George Steinbrenner,

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:31.778
There 's his chopper
swinging in

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.780
over right field
right now, Bob,

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:36.976
How about that?
They're giving me credit for it.

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:39.383
Yeah. I wonder whose
idea it really was.

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:42.321
Well, it's mine now, stupid.

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:58.738
I don't feel like
playing tonight, Al.

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:00.671
Maybe some other time.

01:28:00.742 --> 01:28:02.175
Some other time?

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:03.505
I see.

01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:08.014
When would that time be?

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:09.174
Easter?

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:12.014
Would that be better for you?

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:14.179
How about Christmas Eve?

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:17.014
Seems Al Percolo,

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:19.025
the scout who discovered
Steve Nebraska,

01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:20.560
is up there with him

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:23.028
giving him some
last-minute words of wisdom,

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:24.530
Yeah, and Al Percolo

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.999
has reportedly been under
a psychiatrist's care,

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:30.333
Unfortunate, but we
hope and pray he's O, K.,

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:32.839
What do you think
they're talking about?

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:34.340
It's hard to tell, Robert.

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:35.876
Probably strategy, game plan.

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:38.434
I don't care
what you feel like!

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:40.481
What have I been telling you?

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:41.981
You're a professional!

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:45.281
You play whether
you feel like it or not!

01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:47.787
You're not some
high school kid!

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:49.288
You're a Yankee!

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:52.758
Now get down there
and stop being a baby!

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:54.761
Don’t you call me a baby!

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:58.265
You have no idea what's
going on inside my head!

01:28:58.333 --> 01:28:59.800
I don't care what...

01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:03.303
I don't care what's
going on inside your head!

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:04.963
I don't care about that!

01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:07.269
If you don't stop yelling at me,

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:10.277
I'm going to throw you
off this fucking roof!

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:11.778
Throw me off the roof!

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:13.643
I mean it!
I want you to!

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:15.512
If I go down the stairs,

01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:17.016
they put me in jail!

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:18.746
If you throw me off,

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:21.516
I'd get a ride in an ambulance!

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:26.788
I broke my ass for you.

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:31.623
I discovered you!
I got you the deal!

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:34.133
I found you the doctor!
I feed you!

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.794
You stay with me!

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:38.771
This is how you’re
going to repay me?

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:04.194
Forget it.

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:06.859
What?

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:07.992
Forget it.

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:11.505
I never thought I'd say this.

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.508
Screw the World Series.

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:17.635
If you don't want to pitch,

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:19.509
don't pitch.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.548
You won't get mad at me?

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:24.016
No, I won't be mad at you.

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:25.518
Don't worry about me now.

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.019
I'm sorry I yelled.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:28.453
This is your life.

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:30.514
You do want you want to do.

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:33.025
I'm nothing in this.
I'm just a stupid scout

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.028
that was lucky enough
to see you play.

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:37.360
You're the one
that counts. Not me.

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:38.956
No.

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:43.503
Al, you're like a dad to me.

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:45.971
But I'm not your dad.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.271
I'm just a guy taking 15%

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:52.513
I thought it was 10.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:55.014
No.
10 the first 6 months,

01:30:55.082 --> 01:30:56.515
then we bumped...

01:30:56.584 --> 01:30:58.484
Well, what difference
does it make?

01:30:58.553 --> 01:31:00.544
You're not going to
play anyway.

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:02.987
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.186
Still be my friend?

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:07.693
Yeah, I'll be your friend.

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.195
I'm sure we'll be closer

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:12.061
since nobody will want
to talk to either of us.

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:15.125
I really appreciate
this, Al. I do.

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:21.335
Who's going to pitch if I don't?

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:23.001
Oh, let's not worry
about the lineup now.

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:26.012
The only lineup we should
be concerned about

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.513
is the police lineup.

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:30.210
If I pitched, what's the worst
that could happen?

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:33.951
You'd lose.

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.079
I'd lose.

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:38.117
I'd lose.

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:42.962
Well, that's not so bad

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:46.466
'cause half the guys
down there lose every night.

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:47.466
Yeah.

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:49.469
I wouldn't aim for it,

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:51.971
but that's all
that would happen.

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:53.973
Well, maybe I should try.

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:58.470
Yeah. I want to do it.
Let's pitch.

01:31:58.546 --> 01:31:59.570
You sure?

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:02.241
Yeah. What are you doing
later on?

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:04.307
I don't have any plans, no.

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:07.817
Maybe we could do some laundry.

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:09.789
You love that laundry,
don’t you?

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:10.915
I do.

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:12.983
I got a deal for you.

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.654
You go pitch,
I'll buy the bleach.

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:17.664
You don't get it, do you?

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:18.994
You don't need bleach.

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:20.761
People spend money on stuff

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:22.268
they really don't need.

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:23.963
You get a lemon,

01:32:24.038 --> 01:32:26.506
cut it in half,
get a little salt...

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:28.007
Go play ball.

01:32:28.075 --> 01:32:30.839
We can talk bleach
for hours later.

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.504
What are you doing?

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:35.549
King Kong wouldn't
take the stairs.

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:38.483
Your chariot awaits you.

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:43.513
Go get 'em.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.571
The Yankee copter's pilot

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:02.575
has dropped a rope ladder down,

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:04.577
Too dangerous to land
on the stadium roof

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.203
with all that
electrical equipment,

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.713
But, look, it's working,

01:33:07.782 --> 01:33:08.806
They're lifting off

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:10.316
and taking Steve along

01:33:10.384 --> 01:33:11.578
for the ride,

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:13.087
1, 000 feet over
the playing field,

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:15.085
He's made it to the cabin,

01:33:15.156 --> 01:33:17.920
The pilot's checking for
a safe landing on the field,

01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:20.586
Steve Nebraska heading
down toward the mound.

01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:22.629
This is it. Game time.

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:42.039
Nebraska! Nebraska!

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:43.879
Nebraska! Nebraska!

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.851
Nebraska! Nebraska!

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.388
Nebraska! Nebraska!

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:49.923
Nebraska! Nebraska!

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:52.391
Nebraska! Nebraska!

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.195
All right, baseball fans,

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:58.561
Your long wait
is just about over,

01:33:58.633 --> 01:34:00.601
All the anticipation,
all the speculation,

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:03.899
and now, finally,
the moment has arrived,

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:05.563
Play ball!

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.371
Can Steve Nebraska
deliver on all that promise?

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:11.809
The kid stands
astride the mound,

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:14.473
ready to deliver his first pitch
in the big leagues,

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:16.709
He's got the sign he wants,

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:18.615
The wind, and the pitch,

01:34:18.686 --> 01:34:20.586
Whoa! Did you see that?

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:22.282
Could you see that?

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:24.415
105 miles an hour,

01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:27.325
and right down
the heart of the plate,

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:29.829
Oh, man, is this kid humming?

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:31.956
This kid is
absolutely for real,

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:33.660
Wasting no time,

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:37.033
Rocks into his motion,
and brings the next one home,

01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:39.538
Strike 2, This one
is clocked at 106,

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:41.040
If this keeps up,

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:43.542
they'll have to
reinvent the radar gun

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:45.806
when it comes to
young Steve Nebraska,

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:50.044
Folks, we are in for
some kind of ball game,

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:53.479
You're out!

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:04.830
Strike 3! You're out!

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:08.426
One comes up,
one goes down in this game,

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:10.333
Steve Nebraska
is simply unbelievable,

01:35:10.404 --> 01:35:14.135
Here he comes,
Steve Nebraska's first time at bat,

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:16.108
Tewksbury a much different
kind of pitcher

01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:17.269
than Nebraska...

01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:19.209
control artist,
breaking ball guy,

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.577
likes to mix it up,

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:22.582
He looks in,
gets the sign he wants,

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:24.550
and here 's the pitch
to Nebraska,

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:26.609
Swung on,
and a long, high drive,

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.746
Oh, man,
did he powder this one,

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:31.849
Has to be 425 feet
if it's an inch,

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:33.860
And, yes, Steve Nebraska
can swing the bat

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:36.328
as well as toss the horsehide,

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:37.523
And thanks to Nebraska,

01:35:37.598 --> 01:35:40.999
the Yankees pull ahead
1 to nothing,

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:43.502
Steve Nebraska is one man away

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:46.039
from becoming
the first pitcher in history

01:35:46.107 --> 01:35:49.042
to accomplish
a mind-boggling feat...

01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:52.409
27 up, 27 down, 81 pitches,

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.913
all of them strikes,

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:55.972
And look who's advancing
to the plate...

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:57.483
Ozzie Smith himself,

01:35:57.551 --> 01:35:59.041
0 for 2 tonight,

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.054
but five homers in the playoffs

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:03.556
in an unexpected
outburst of power,

01:36:03.624 --> 01:36:05.251
What a season he's had,

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:07.385
If anybody can break
this Nebraska streak,

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.895
Ozzie Smith could
be the guy to do it,

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:13.422
Nebraska peers in
at the Wizard of Oz,

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:17.267
rocks into his motion
and delivers... Oh, man!

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:20.739
Looks like the kid's prepared
to deliver on his promise,

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:23.174
Steve Nebraska trying
to put the finishing touches

01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:24.677
on a masterpiece,

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:26.736
And his pitch,

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:29.078
strike 2!

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:32.085
I cannot believe this,

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:33.586
This is beyond excitement,

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:36.088
I mean, this is over
the rainbow,

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:39.558
His 81 st pitch
of the night coming up,

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:05.883
Oh, my gosh!
Where did that come from?

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:08.148
What the hell was that?

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:10.156
I think it was a strike.

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:12.988
Strike 3! You're out!

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.551
112 miles an hour!

01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:18.063
It's a record in every respect,

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:21.568
81 pitches, 27 up, 27 down,

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:23.068
It's a record,

01:37:23.137 --> 01:37:25.571
And the Yankees win 2-0,

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:27.300
Hey! Al!

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:30.373
