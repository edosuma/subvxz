You up for the gig?

34:29.150 --> 34:30.527
Are we going to shoot him?

34:31.152 --> 34:33.697
It's not about that.
It's about watching.

34:33.781 --> 34:38.159

we'll get him.

34:55.302 --> 34:56.303
He's getting out of hand

34:58.931 --> 35:00.015
What do you
want me to do...

35:00.724 --> 35:01.850
kill him?

35:01.892 --> 35:04.186
Just get him off real estate

35:04.269 --> 35:06.105
It's a big job,
too much money

35:06.188 --> 35:07.523

Cops die all the time,

fact they were tortured.

39:21.109 --> 39:22.194
Badly.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.780
So we wanted to ask you
where you got the money.

39:25.238 --> 39:28.658
We are just concerned that
someone might be looking for it.

we need to know who it is.

is a lot of money.

found in a brand new Mercedes.

you got the money.

we could help.

I'll kick your ass.

down his chin and shit.

JAVI: This gun
belonged to Doroteo Arango.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.280
Do you know who he was?

01:00:58.364 --> 01:01:02.034
No, but I'm guessing he's dead,
because you have his gun.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:04.578
He was better
known as Pancho Villa.

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:10.209
This is the same gun he fired in the
Opera Restaurant in Mexico City.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.087
Have you ever been there?
No.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.048

still there in the ceiling.

01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:20.219

in the States.

During the revolution, there
was a shortage of bullets.

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:39.405
And Pancho was
well aware of that.

01:01:39.947 --> 01:01:42.491
So he always made sure
that every bullet counted.

That's not a good idea

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.635
There are two reasons
not to kill me

I'll kill Frank

01:02:36.587 --> 01:02:37.671

the final straw

is closing the prison

Hurry up
