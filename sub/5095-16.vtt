00:05.615 --> 00:07.791
<i>You're so scared</i>
<i>of a pot charge that you peed</i>

00:07.792 --> 00:09.458
your pants?
Come on.

00:09.460 --> 00:11.460
You're just gonna walk me
through here like this?

00:11.462 --> 00:13.662
What's wrong, frat boy?
Not feeling so tough

00:13.664 --> 00:15.130
since you
sprung a leak?

00:15.132 --> 00:17.833
This is a violation
of my civil rights.

00:17.835 --> 00:20.302
The only violation is what
you did in our backseat.

00:20.304 --> 00:21.970
Now we're gonna have
to clean it up.

00:21.972 --> 00:24.707
Hey, Reagan.
Heads up.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.177
Forgot we told
him to come in.

00:28.179 --> 00:30.646
Well, at least he looks sober today.
You want to start the paperwork

00:30.648 --> 00:33.015
on frat boy here while
I go talk to Mr. Drake?

00:33.017 --> 00:34.416
Uh, nice try.

00:34.418 --> 00:37.352
Thanks.
Come on.

00:37.354 --> 00:38.854
Mr. Drake,

00:38.856 --> 00:40.122
thanks for coming in.

00:40.124 --> 00:43.192
Of course. I, uh, came
as soon as I got your message.

00:43.194 --> 00:44.960
What's this about?

00:44.962 --> 00:47.162
Let's find a room
where we can talk.

00:47.164 --> 00:49.431
This has something to do
with Heather, doesn't it?

00:49.433 --> 00:51.233
She called you guys again,
didn't she?

00:51.235 --> 00:52.701
We'll talk
about it inside.

00:52.703 --> 00:55.971
Look, whatever she said I did,
I promise you, I didn't do it.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.273
It's all in her head,
I swear.

00:58.275 --> 01:01.910
Ever since we separated,
she's-she's just not herself.

01:01.912 --> 01:04.012
After you.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.554
I don't understand.

01:12.556 --> 01:15.390
I just saw him an hour ago.

01:15.392 --> 01:17.526
I should have gone
with him.

01:17.528 --> 01:19.161
Why didn't I go with him?

01:19.163 --> 01:21.196
Mrs. Jackson, you
can't blame yourself.

01:21.198 --> 01:23.031
Yeah, blame the gang members
having a shoot-out

01:23.033 --> 01:24.600
in the middle of the street.

01:24.602 --> 01:25.801
Do you know who did it?

01:25.803 --> 01:27.936
Do you know
who killed my Reginald?

01:27.938 --> 01:30.372
The detectives are working
on it as we speak.

01:30.374 --> 01:31.774
In the middle of the street?

01:31.776 --> 01:33.976
There must have been
witnesses. Surely someone saw

01:33.978 --> 01:36.245
who shot my husband.
Unfortunately,

01:36.247 --> 01:39.014
at this time, no one has come
forward with any information.

01:39.016 --> 01:42.017
No one will talk to you
because you're the police.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.986
We are having some
difficulty finding witnesses

01:43.988 --> 01:46.288
willing to come
forward, yes.

01:46.290 --> 01:49.691
Oh.

01:52.395 --> 01:55.631
How much does a funeral cost?

01:55.633 --> 01:58.600
Usually a few
thousand dollars or so.

01:58.602 --> 02:01.637
Oh. I-I...

02:01.639 --> 02:04.439
I don't have that kind of money.
In the event

02:04.441 --> 02:06.108
that you're unable to
afford a private burial,

02:06.110 --> 02:09.777
one will be provided to you
by the city on Hart Island.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.780
That's potter's field, isn't it?

02:13.349 --> 02:17.719
No-no ceremony?

02:17.721 --> 02:20.189
No tombstone?

02:20.191 --> 02:22.991
Don't worry about the cost,
Mrs. Jackson.

02:23.993 --> 02:26.328
We'll take care of it.

02:33.503 --> 02:35.571
<i>You can't do this</i>

02:35.573 --> 02:37.072
to me.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.575
Mr. Drake, I'm not
doing anything to you.

02:39.577 --> 02:42.211
I am simply carrying out
the orders of the courts.

02:42.213 --> 02:45.080
A restraining order?
Do you know what this means?

02:45.082 --> 02:47.316
I only know what it says.
That you are prohibited

02:47.318 --> 02:50.752
from coming within 500 yards
of your soon-to-be ex-wife.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.120
This says I threatened her.

02:52.122 --> 02:55.023
That's not true. I never said
I was going to hurt her.

02:55.025 --> 02:57.059
Well, the judge felt differently
after your wife's lawyers

02:57.061 --> 02:58.327
played your voicemails for him.

02:58.329 --> 02:59.995
Come on.

02:59.997 --> 03:01.630
You never said something
you didn't mean

03:01.632 --> 03:03.098
after a couple of drinks?

03:04.734 --> 03:09.004
She was keeping my daughter
from me.

03:11.507 --> 03:14.610
She wouldn't let me talk to her.

03:14.612 --> 03:16.712
She has no right.

03:16.714 --> 03:18.647
Look, Mr. Drake,

03:18.649 --> 03:21.083
I think deep down
you're a good guy

03:21.085 --> 03:23.619
who's just in a bad way.

03:23.621 --> 03:26.321
Why don't you look at this
as a wake-up call,

03:26.323 --> 03:28.857
you know? A-a chance
to get some help

03:28.859 --> 03:30.993
with the drinking.
And maybe then the judge

03:30.995 --> 03:32.461
will reconsider.
Okay.

03:32.463 --> 03:35.130
You don't understand.
This is exactly

03:35.132 --> 03:36.465
what my wife wants
to have happen.

03:36.467 --> 03:39.368
She's trying to force
my daughter out of my life.

03:39.370 --> 03:40.502
Please, just sit down...

03:40.504 --> 03:42.704
Don't you see
this is all part of her plan?

03:43.873 --> 03:45.040
You know why she's doing this?

03:45.042 --> 03:47.509
Because she knows now
that there is no chance in hell

03:47.511 --> 03:48.610
that I get shared custody

03:48.612 --> 03:50.078
with something like this
on my record.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.513
Mr. Drake, just listen to me...
No,

03:51.515 --> 03:53.148
you listen to me.

03:54.183 --> 03:57.886
I am not going
to let this happen.

03:59.222 --> 04:03.592
Penelope is my daughter,

04:03.594 --> 04:06.328
and no one is going
to keep her from me.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.296
Okay. Look,

04:07.298 --> 04:09.064
just sit down...

04:13.536 --> 04:15.804
Anthony... please.

04:15.806 --> 04:18.440
You do not want to do this.

04:18.442 --> 04:21.176
Put your gun on the table.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.577
Anthony...

04:22.579 --> 04:24.012
Now.

at this time.

04:49.573 --> 04:50.839
Who's on the scene?

04:50.841 --> 04:53.942
The precinct C.O., ESU,
and the borough commander.

04:53.944 --> 04:55.277
Do you want me
to go down there, sir?

04:55.279 --> 04:57.612
Quick math says
it's a full house as it is.

04:57.614 --> 04:58.914
Monitor it from here,

04:58.916 --> 05:02.384
and report back
as the situation warrants.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.119
Yes, sir.

05:05.755 --> 05:08.049

What do we have,
Detective?

05:45.958 --> 05:48.025
Guy's name is Anthony Drake.

05:48.027 --> 05:50.347
My partner and I met him on
a domestic a few weeks ago.

05:50.348 --> 05:51.313
He's going through

05:51.315 --> 05:52.315
a nasty divorce.

05:52.316 --> 05:53.615
And he's here today

Word came down from the court

05:54.885 --> 05:56.585
to serve him
with a restraining order.

05:56.587 --> 05:58.053
Emotionally

He's got a drinking problem
that went from bad to worse

06:00.524 --> 06:02.558
when his old lady called it
quits. They got a 12-year-old

06:02.560 --> 06:04.893
who's the rope in the
middle of their tug-of-war.

06:04.895 --> 06:07.329
What the hell? The entire
SWAT team is showing up?

06:07.331 --> 06:09.932
You brought a gun
into a police precinct.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.867
You must have thought
something was gonna happen.

06:11.869 --> 06:13.502
You think I
planned this?

06:13.504 --> 06:14.970
I didn't plan it.

<i>- Why didn't Detective Baez</i>

06:17.375 --> 06:20.008
toss him before she took him in there?
All due respect,

06:20.010 --> 06:21.844
Chief, we weren't
arresting the guy,

06:21.846 --> 06:23.479
so we didn't need
to toss him.

06:23.481 --> 06:25.748
Chief, my snipers
are ready when you are.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.349
Lieutenant, maybe we
ought to slow down

06:27.351 --> 06:28.751
with the snipers
a second here.

06:28.753 --> 06:30.185
Is there a problem, Detective?
Yeah, this guy Drake

06:30.187 --> 06:31.887
is the fragile
type, you know?

06:31.889 --> 06:33.055
We don't want
to spook him.

06:33.057 --> 06:34.156
All right. Hold your position,

06:34.158 --> 06:36.859
but nobody moves
until I give the order.

06:36.861 --> 06:38.193
Okay.

06:38.195 --> 06:39.995
Now, how do we talk to this guy?
We got a phone

06:39.997 --> 06:42.364
set up over here,
Chief, but...

06:42.366 --> 06:43.732
But what?

06:43.734 --> 06:46.802
That's my partner in there.

06:46.804 --> 06:49.471
Detective, we don't need a hero.
And I'm not trying

06:49.473 --> 06:52.174
to be one. But I've been
decent with this guy Drake,

06:52.176 --> 06:54.777
and maybe that'll buy me some
goodwill and I can help.

06:56.479 --> 06:58.180
Okay.

06:58.182 --> 06:59.715
You're on.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.263
Something's going on.

07:14.265 --> 07:16.465
I debated whether to talk
to somebody downstairs,

07:16.467 --> 07:18.100
but I was afraid you might think

07:18.102 --> 07:20.002
I was going around you.
Duly noted.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.571
It's my stepson, Sam.
Cynthia's boy.

07:22.573 --> 07:24.473
Yeah, the hockey player.
What about him?

07:24.475 --> 07:25.741
He's in jail at the 3-5.

07:25.743 --> 07:28.744
He was arrested
for scoring oxycodone

07:28.746 --> 07:32.014
in an observational buy
up in Washington Heights.

07:32.882 --> 07:34.550
I'm sorry.

07:34.552 --> 07:36.385
He's a good kid, Frank.

07:36.387 --> 07:38.020
How bad is it?

07:38.022 --> 07:39.888
Two years now.

07:39.890 --> 07:41.390
You think the
heroin situation

07:41.392 --> 07:43.225
we have out there is a mother?

07:43.227 --> 07:44.827
You ain't seen nothing

07:44.829 --> 07:47.296
until you've watched someone
you love try to kick oxy.

07:47.298 --> 07:48.564
Rehab?

07:48.566 --> 07:49.598
Twice.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.566
Priors?

07:50.568 --> 07:53.302
None.

07:53.304 --> 07:57.039
Well, then I can't see the D.A.
making more of it than it is,

07:57.041 --> 07:58.640
a first-time offense.

07:58.642 --> 08:01.477
I can't take that chance. H-He's
got to go back into rehab,

08:01.479 --> 08:02.945
not into prison.

08:02.947 --> 08:06.048
On top of everything,
that'll crush him for good.

08:07.951 --> 08:10.886
What are you asking, Garrett?

08:10.888 --> 08:15.224
Get the charges dropped and
him released into my custody.

08:17.895 --> 08:18.927
Yeah.

08:18.929 --> 08:19.895
Please?

08:19.897 --> 08:21.163
Chief Daniels at the scene.

08:21.165 --> 08:23.065
Uh, hold on a second, Baker.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.105
It's Borough Command
on the scene.

08:25.106 --> 08:27.135
There's a clock
on this, Frank.

08:27.137 --> 08:28.170
I won't be long.

08:28.172 --> 08:29.271
Thank you, Frank.

08:29.273 --> 08:31.173
I haven't done anything yet.

08:31.175 --> 08:33.475
This is embarrassing,
and...

08:33.477 --> 08:35.644
you've made it less so.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.379
I'll get back to you.

08:37.381 --> 08:39.581
Yeah.

08:39.582 --> 08:41.817
Put him through, Baker.

08:41.818 --> 08:43.818
Yes, Chief.

08:43.821 --> 08:46.889
Yeah, I
understand.

09:01.004 --> 09:03.206
It's not
too late, Anthony.

09:03.207 --> 09:05.174
You can end
this right now.

09:05.176 --> 09:07.676
Just put the gun down, and it'll
be like this never happened.

09:07.678 --> 09:09.244
Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying.

09:09.246 --> 09:10.062
Yes, you are.

09:10.086 --> 09:12.122
She's not lying to you.

09:13.084 --> 09:15.517
She's trying to help you.
Who is that?

09:15.519 --> 09:18.120
Detective Reagan. Okay?

09:18.122 --> 09:20.656
Anthony, look,
I just want to help you, too.

09:20.658 --> 09:21.957
Who are you kidding?!

09:21.959 --> 09:23.425
No one
can help me now.

09:23.427 --> 09:27.229
The only way out of here for me
is in a coffin or a jail cell.

09:27.231 --> 09:30.032
No. No. Slow down. Nobody's

09:30.034 --> 09:31.834
dying here today.
Not on my watch.

09:31.836 --> 09:33.869
I'm not gonna lie to you,
Anthony. You're looking

09:33.871 --> 09:35.104
at some jail time, okay?

09:35.106 --> 09:36.638
But trust me,
there's a big difference

09:36.640 --> 09:39.675
between one year
and a life sentence.

09:39.677 --> 09:41.343
I already got a life sentence.

09:41.345 --> 09:44.213
They're never gonna let me see
my daughter again.

09:44.215 --> 09:45.481
Is that what this is about?

09:45.483 --> 09:47.749
You want
to see Penelope?

09:47.751 --> 09:50.185
She's my daughter, too.

09:50.187 --> 09:51.653
Of course she is.

09:51.655 --> 09:53.222
She loves you.

09:53.224 --> 09:54.923
I just want to talk to her.

09:54.925 --> 09:56.592
I want to tell her
what's going on!

09:56.594 --> 09:59.428
What her mother is doing to me.
Why I did

09:59.430 --> 10:01.463
what I had to do.
Okay.

10:01.465 --> 10:03.398
Okay, then, so...

10:03.400 --> 10:06.268
how about I work on getting
Penelope down here for you,

10:06.270 --> 10:07.636
and in exchange,

10:07.638 --> 10:10.372
you do something for me.

10:10.374 --> 10:12.541
What?

10:13.610 --> 10:16.178
You will not hurt my partner.

10:21.017 --> 10:22.851
She's fine.

10:22.853 --> 10:25.053
She'll be just fine.

10:32.162 --> 10:33.562
Doesn't this get old,
even for you?

10:33.564 --> 10:35.230
I don't need another lecture.
And I don't feel

10:35.232 --> 10:36.598
like giving you one.
Good.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.734
But maybe if you'd listen
to me, the first 500...

10:38.736 --> 10:40.669
I'm sorry.
So what do you need, huh?

10:40.671 --> 10:41.218
I need help.

10:41.242 --> 10:43.239
I mean besides the
obvious-- the oxycodone.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.907
I said I need help
and I'm sorry.

10:44.909 --> 10:47.843
It's not enough!
It has to be. That's all I've got.

10:47.845 --> 10:50.746
Oh, you're gonna cry?
You want me to get your mom?

10:50.748 --> 10:52.147
No.
Man up.

10:52.149 --> 10:53.749
Screw you.

10:55.018 --> 10:57.953
This is the last time,
I swear.

10:57.955 --> 10:59.188
The hell it is.

11:03.927 --> 11:06.328
The earliest they can arraign
you is this afternoon.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.764
I'll see what I can do
in the meantime.

11:08.766 --> 11:11.233
Thank you.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.978
You really want
to thank me? Don't put me

11:13.002 --> 11:14.070
I know.

11:14.071 --> 11:15.938
in this position...
Position again.

11:26.149 --> 11:28.584
Heather Drake on one for you.

11:29.953 --> 11:31.653
Mrs. Drake,
this is Detective Reagan.

11:31.655 --> 11:33.989
Did they explain to you
what's going on down here

11:33.991 --> 11:34.991
with your husband?

11:34.992 --> 11:37.693
Ex-husband.
And yes, they did.

11:37.695 --> 11:40.128
Can't say that I'm surprised--
I've been saying for months

11:40.130 --> 11:42.097
that he's not stable.
Okay, well, look,

11:42.099 --> 11:44.066
we think we may have a solution
to the problem,

11:44.068 --> 11:45.534
but we're gonna need
your cooperation.

11:45.536 --> 11:48.136
Look, Lord knows I have
my problems with Anthony,

11:48.138 --> 11:49.438
but by no means

11:49.440 --> 11:51.607
do I wish him any harm.
I'll do what I can.

11:51.609 --> 11:54.509
Great. We have a squad car
coming to your house right now.

11:54.511 --> 11:56.111
We're hoping
that you'd get inside,

11:56.113 --> 11:57.679
come on down here with Penelope.

11:57.681 --> 12:00.215
What?! Absolutely not.

12:00.217 --> 12:02.050
Mrs. Drake, all Anthony wants

12:02.052 --> 12:05.454
is a chance to explain himself
and to see her.

12:05.456 --> 12:07.823
Oh, is that all Anthony wants?
To send his daughter

12:07.825 --> 12:09.825
I give you my word
into a combat zone?

12:09.827 --> 12:11.059
nothing is gonna happen to her.

12:11.061 --> 12:12.794
I'll be by her side
the whole time,

12:12.796 --> 12:14.630
all of us behind
bulletproof shields.

12:14.632 --> 12:17.099
Oh, good. That makes
me feel much better.

12:17.101 --> 12:19.835
I know this is the last thing
you want to deal with,

12:19.837 --> 12:21.737
but just a few minutes
with your daughter

12:21.739 --> 12:23.338
could end all of this
peacefully.

12:23.340 --> 12:27.943
I'm sorry, but this is
really not my responsibility.

12:27.945 --> 12:30.145
No, it's not
your responsibility,

12:30.147 --> 12:34.182
but you have an opportunity here
to save a cop's life.

12:35.385 --> 12:38.353
You said a car is on its way?

12:38.355 --> 12:40.355
Five, ten minutes, tops.

12:43.393 --> 12:45.060
Okay.

12:45.062 --> 12:47.162
Thank you.

12:47.164 --> 12:50.232
It's bad enough her
husband of 50 years

12:50.234 --> 12:52.067
was just murdered,
and without a witness,

12:52.069 --> 12:54.703
we're probably not gonna be
able to collar up on this guy.

12:54.705 --> 12:57.272
The least we can do is help
him have a proper burial.

12:57.274 --> 13:00.342
Hey, I got no problem with that,
but I don't have that kind of money.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.977
Unless you won the lottery
earlier this morning

13:01.979 --> 13:04.012
and forgot to tell me,
neither do you.

13:04.014 --> 13:05.514
Well...

13:05.516 --> 13:08.417
you know, listen, maybe
I don't have three grand,

13:08.419 --> 13:10.519
but...

13:10.521 --> 13:13.188
I got a couple of bucks.

13:20.029 --> 13:24.232
Great. Now where do we get
the other $2,995?

13:24.234 --> 13:27.436
We'll ask around
the neighborhood.

13:27.438 --> 13:30.105
We'll have it by
end of tour easy.

13:30.107 --> 13:31.807
Easy?

13:31.809 --> 13:33.075
We got anything?

13:33.077 --> 13:36.111
Officers are at the scene
at the Drake residence now.

13:36.113 --> 13:37.746
All right, let's get
them here. Come on.

13:37.748 --> 13:38.914
Damn it!

13:38.916 --> 13:40.215
What?

13:40.217 --> 13:42.317
Heather's gone.

13:42.319 --> 13:43.885
What do you mean, she's gone?
Neighbors are

13:43.887 --> 13:46.154
telling our uniforms
she took off with Penelope.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.359
Excuse me, sir.

13:50.361 --> 13:52.060
The men are in
position, Chief.

13:52.062 --> 13:53.695
What the hell
you talking about?

13:53.697 --> 13:55.597
They're in position for what?
What is she talking about?

13:55.599 --> 13:56.732
Plan B.

13:56.734 --> 13:58.600
What, snipers?

13:58.602 --> 13:59.835
You realize

13:59.837 --> 14:02.037
that is bulletproof glass,
right?

14:02.039 --> 14:04.072
A coordinated blast
from three high-powered rifles

14:04.074 --> 14:05.507
takes out that glass.

14:05.509 --> 14:07.476
And then another shot takes out the target.
That's right.

14:07.478 --> 14:09.477
Yeah, and what if my partner
is too close to the target?

14:09.501 --> 14:10.913
She will be fine.

14:10.914 --> 14:12.047
Oh, because you've taken
the shot before?

14:12.049 --> 14:13.448
Many times.

14:13.450 --> 14:15.650
Really? In training
or in the field?

14:17.019 --> 14:18.253
Thought so.

14:18.255 --> 14:20.322
How you holding up
in there, Anthony?

14:22.425 --> 14:23.291
What are you doing?

14:23.293 --> 14:25.394
I got good news for you,
Anthony.

14:25.396 --> 14:27.095
Penelope's on her way down.

14:28.431 --> 14:30.499
Really?
Oh, yeah.

14:30.501 --> 14:33.068
Yep. City traffic,
it might take a while,

14:33.070 --> 14:35.070
but she's coming--
so you just hang in there, okay?

14:43.846 --> 14:45.947
I talked to her, what,
five minutes ago?

14:45.949 --> 14:48.784
Five minutes-- how far could she
possibly get with her daughter

14:48.786 --> 14:49.885
in five minutes.

14:49.887 --> 14:51.620
Let's ping her phone,

14:51.622 --> 14:55.357
track her down, get her here,
and we can end this peacefully.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.094
You heard him.

14:59.096 --> 15:01.263
Ping that phone.

15:02.365 --> 15:05.000
I don't mind what you did,

15:05.002 --> 15:07.669
but I mind how you did it.

15:24.978 --> 15:27.245
This is Heather.
You know what to do.

15:27.247 --> 15:28.380
This is Detective Reagan.

15:28.382 --> 15:30.615
You know what to do, too--
pick up your phone

15:30.617 --> 15:32.851
and call me back immediately.

15:32.853 --> 15:34.853
We've tracked down
Heather's phone.

15:34.855 --> 15:36.188
Good?
Bad.

15:36.190 --> 15:38.223
It's in her house.
She left it behind.

15:38.225 --> 15:40.525
Smart lady.
Look, we're gonna need

15:40.527 --> 15:41.660
a safety net.

15:41.662 --> 15:43.795
I need to put
those sharpshooters in place.

15:43.797 --> 15:46.264
Whoa, Chief, Chief, Penelope's
got a cell phone, too.

15:46.266 --> 15:47.632
Why don't we track that?

15:47.634 --> 15:49.701
Well, if the mother left the
phone behind, don't you figure

15:49.703 --> 15:51.636
she would have done the same
with the kid's phone?

15:51.638 --> 15:53.772
Not if she didn't know
Penelope had a phone.

15:53.774 --> 15:55.507
When we met Drake,
he kept going on about

15:55.509 --> 15:57.676
how he had to sneak Penelope a
phone behind her mother's back.

15:57.678 --> 15:59.377
It's the only way
he could talk to her.

15:59.379 --> 16:00.712
You got the number?

16:00.714 --> 16:02.214
No.
It'll take hours

16:02.216 --> 16:04.316
we don't have to contact
every phone carrier

16:04.318 --> 16:06.017
to find out that number.

16:07.420 --> 16:10.622
What if it's right
under our noses?

16:10.624 --> 16:11.890
That's Drake's
cell phone.

16:11.892 --> 16:14.025
He's got to have
his own daughter's number

16:14.027 --> 16:15.627
stored inside, doesn't he?

16:15.629 --> 16:17.629
So you're planning
on just waltzing in there?

16:17.631 --> 16:20.632
Or do you have an invisibility
cloak I don't know about.

16:20.634 --> 16:23.335
I got something
better than that.

16:34.313 --> 16:36.481
I got bait.

16:38.150 --> 16:41.386
Uh, excuse me? Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

16:41.388 --> 16:42.954
Hi. I'm Officer Janko,

16:42.956 --> 16:45.257
and this is my partner,
Officer Reagan.

16:45.259 --> 16:46.625
As many of you know,

16:46.627 --> 16:49.561
a beloved member of the community,
Reginald Jackson,

16:49.563 --> 16:51.663
was gunned down
just a few blocks from here

16:51.665 --> 16:52.998
earlier this morning.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.868
Yo. Nobody in here knows nothing
about that, all right?

16:57.937 --> 16:59.804
Listen, it's okay,

16:59.806 --> 17:02.674
we're not here to...

17:04.109 --> 17:05.877
We're not here to ask
anyone what they know,

17:05.878 --> 17:08.847
or even if they saw anything.
Right. It's our understanding

17:08.848 --> 17:10.781
that Mr. and Mrs. Jackson
eat breakfast, lunch,

17:10.784 --> 17:13.785
dinner in this place together
here at this table.

17:13.787 --> 17:17.289
So we're here asking if you
can help us raise some money

17:17.290 --> 17:19.424
for Alice Jackson,
Reginald's wife,

17:19.425 --> 17:21.926
to give her husband
a proper burial.

17:21.929 --> 17:23.694
Come on, I...

17:23.696 --> 17:25.931
I know you all know
this family.

17:25.933 --> 17:28.633
So any little bit
can help.

17:29.468 --> 17:30.635
Thank you.

17:30.637 --> 17:33.738
I'm sorry for interrupting
your meals.

17:35.441 --> 17:36.942
Eddie.

17:39.478 --> 17:41.313
Hey, excuse me!

17:41.315 --> 17:43.682
Hold up a second?

17:43.684 --> 17:45.392
Could you take your hands
out of your pockets?

17:45.415 --> 17:46.718
Look, alls I got to say

17:46.720 --> 17:49.387
is I ain't got nothing to say
about what it is you want.

17:49.389 --> 17:51.456
Yeah? What do I want?
You want to know how

17:51.458 --> 17:53.258
that old man got got.
I don't know nothing.

17:53.260 --> 17:55.460
Yeah, is that why you were trying
to disappear behind that menu?

17:55.462 --> 17:56.981
Huh? Why you snuck out here

17:57.005 --> 17:59.126
the second I turned my back?
Because you know nothing?

17:59.766 --> 18:01.232
Straight up.

18:01.234 --> 18:04.869
Look, Mr. Jackson was killed
earlier this morning

18:04.871 --> 18:06.838
by a member of that gang, okay?

18:06.840 --> 18:09.074
But tomorrow
it could be your grandfather

18:09.076 --> 18:10.542
of your brother
or maybe even you.

18:10.544 --> 18:11.928
Wouldn't you want someone
to speak up then?

18:11.929 --> 18:14.679
Look, it don't matter what I want.
This just not how

18:14.681 --> 18:15.747
things are done,
and that's that.

18:15.749 --> 18:17.382
Well, it doesn't have
to be that way.

18:17.384 --> 18:19.584
Yeah, it do.
Why?

18:19.586 --> 18:22.787
'Cause anyone tell Five-O
about the dirt this crew do...

18:22.789 --> 18:24.155
guess what?

18:24.157 --> 18:26.024
You the next one to get got.

18:26.026 --> 18:27.625
Until someone takes a stand.

18:27.627 --> 18:29.394
Till someone says
enough is enough.

18:29.396 --> 18:31.496
And that's the day the good people
can take this neighborhood back

18:31.498 --> 18:32.530
from the gangs.

18:32.532 --> 18:34.532
Oh, yeah, you know a
lot about gangs, huh?

18:34.534 --> 18:36.801
Had a lot of bad-ass crews
rolling through your hood

18:36.803 --> 18:38.436
when you was coming
up, didn't you?

18:38.438 --> 18:40.705
I didn't think so.

18:40.707 --> 18:44.009
N-Now, unless you're
cuffing me, I'm out.

18:46.512 --> 18:48.279
Hey, everything okay
here, partner?

18:48.281 --> 18:50.882
Yeah, I hope you did
better than me.

18:52.085 --> 18:53.718
No.

19:14.206 --> 19:16.975
What are you looking at?
Nothing.

19:16.977 --> 19:18.910
I wasn't looking
at anything.

19:20.881 --> 19:23.114
I'm warning you,
if you try anything...

19:23.116 --> 19:24.682
You think I don't know that?

19:24.684 --> 19:27.052
You have a gun pointed
at my face--

19:27.054 --> 19:29.421
of course I'm
not gonna try anything.

19:33.559 --> 19:35.260
I'm sorry.

19:35.262 --> 19:37.395
My nerves
are just...

19:37.397 --> 19:39.464
getting the best of me.

19:39.466 --> 19:41.599
Well, how about something
to drink? Some water?

19:41.601 --> 19:43.935
Yeah. Sure.

19:43.937 --> 19:46.104
Maybe something
a little stronger?

19:46.106 --> 19:48.306
You mean like...

19:48.308 --> 19:50.475
I got a bottle of scotch
in my drawer

19:50.477 --> 19:51.910
that's ours for the asking.

19:52.778 --> 19:55.146
You think they'd do that?

19:55.148 --> 19:57.115
You think they'd let us?

19:57.117 --> 19:59.451
You're holding the gun, Anthony.

19:59.453 --> 20:03.088
You're the boss--
they'll do whatever you say.

20:06.725 --> 20:10.061
DCPI Moore called in a favor
from the Chief of Narcotics

20:10.063 --> 20:13.465
on a buy Sam made
in the Village last fall,

20:13.467 --> 20:16.034
and on a straight possession
collar by patrol last summer.

20:16.036 --> 20:17.802
Arrests and convictions
outside the city?

20:17.804 --> 20:19.170
In White Plains,

20:19.172 --> 20:20.405
where he lives.

20:20.407 --> 20:22.774
Two arrests, both got squashed
before arraignment.

20:22.776 --> 20:24.742
Because of calls
from this department?

20:24.744 --> 20:26.544
I don't know that for a fact.

20:26.546 --> 20:27.879
But what do you think?

20:29.782 --> 20:31.749
That's not for me to say, sir.

20:33.653 --> 20:35.320
Sorry to bother, but...

20:35.322 --> 20:36.588
Step in.

20:36.590 --> 20:38.490
I can come back.

20:38.492 --> 20:40.458
Step in, please.

20:40.460 --> 20:42.961
Thank you, Baker.

20:47.299 --> 20:49.534
You spun me.

20:49.536 --> 20:51.269
No.
Yeah, you did.

20:51.271 --> 20:53.638
I asked you
if Sam had priors.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.006
And he doesn't.
Because

20:55.008 --> 20:56.107
you interfered,

20:56.109 --> 20:57.675
because you used the influence
of your office!

20:57.677 --> 20:59.944
And that crap
about not wanting

20:59.946 --> 21:01.446
to look like
you were going around me?!

21:01.448 --> 21:03.681
Frank, listen...
I did listen.

21:03.683 --> 21:05.884
The hell do you expect me
to do!? I raised that boy!

21:05.886 --> 21:08.586
What kind of father wouldn't do
all he can for his kid?

21:08.588 --> 21:09.454
What kid?

21:09.456 --> 21:11.689
Sam! I raised him from five!

21:11.691 --> 21:12.991
He's not a kid anymore!

21:12.993 --> 21:14.325
We're not talking about a kid.
He's, what?

21:14.327 --> 21:15.527
Age doesn't matter!

21:15.529 --> 21:16.995
It <i>does</i> matter! At some...

21:16.997 --> 21:19.030
Stop! Please!

21:20.699 --> 21:22.734
Just stop.

21:22.736 --> 21:24.936
Consider the request withdrawn.

21:24.938 --> 21:26.905
Just like that?
Just like that?

21:26.907 --> 21:28.606
No. You raised

21:28.608 --> 21:30.475
Joe, Danny, Erin and Jamie.

21:30.477 --> 21:32.210
You didn't raise a Sam.

21:32.212 --> 21:35.446
You have every right to refuse
my request to help him.

21:35.448 --> 21:39.050
You're not helping him, Garrett.

21:39.052 --> 21:43.188
But you have no right
to judge me for what I do

21:43.190 --> 21:46.224
or try to do regarding my boy.

21:58.405 --> 21:59.704
Your pockets!

22:02.341 --> 22:04.509
Lift up your vest.

22:05.945 --> 22:07.979
Show me your ankles.

22:12.485 --> 22:15.353
Okay.

22:15.355 --> 22:16.688
Come around.

22:25.231 --> 22:28.366
Come in... slowly.

22:30.337 --> 22:31.669
They're gone. It's just me.

22:31.671 --> 22:34.005
One false move, and
I'm gonna end this.

22:34.007 --> 22:36.040
Just bringing the booze
like you asked, okay?

22:36.042 --> 22:38.209
Okay. Put it down.

22:38.211 --> 22:39.377
It's my new window.

22:39.379 --> 22:42.247
All right? Be careful.

22:42.249 --> 22:44.082
Can I say something?

22:44.084 --> 22:46.017
Put the gun down
and come out peacefully.

22:46.019 --> 22:47.385
Not gonna happen.

22:47.387 --> 22:48.886
Not till I look
Penelope in the eye

22:48.888 --> 22:50.755
and tell her my side

22:50.757 --> 22:51.923
of the story.

22:51.925 --> 22:54.192
I'm with you on that, okay?
Trust me.

22:54.194 --> 22:58.263
Just do me a favor. Look at all
those cops out there, would you?

22:58.265 --> 23:00.865
Look at them all.
They're nervous.

23:00.867 --> 23:03.601
They're getting tired.
I would hate to see something

23:03.603 --> 23:06.471
happen to anyone-- you or them--

23:06.473 --> 23:09.307
just 'cause we're all a little
skittish right now, you know?

23:10.510 --> 23:12.477
Thanks for the bottle.

23:12.479 --> 23:14.379
You got it.

23:37.269 --> 23:38.536
Penelope.

23:38.538 --> 23:40.305
Let's get a trace on it.

23:40.307 --> 23:41.906
Pray he doesn't notice.

23:41.908 --> 23:45.810
You first... in case
they slipped something in it.

23:45.812 --> 23:48.546
That was, uh... nice, Reagan.

23:48.548 --> 23:49.814
Thanks, Chief.

23:49.816 --> 23:51.182
More. Come on.

23:53.452 --> 23:55.653
Erin, listen, I got RMP
on the way to pick you up.

23:55.655 --> 23:57.522
- What?
- Just get in the car.

23:57.524 --> 23:59.657
I'll explain on the way.

23:59.659 --> 24:01.125
On my way where?

24:01.127 --> 24:02.727
Again.

24:02.729 --> 24:05.496
More.

24:06.832 --> 24:09.100
Mm.

24:19.945 --> 24:22.013
Oh. Oh.

24:23.249 --> 24:24.582
Do you think I'm stupid?

24:24.584 --> 24:26.651
You think I'm gonna
let you get me drunk?!

24:26.653 --> 24:29.053
Here? Now?

24:30.289 --> 24:32.357
If Penelope's not
here in an hour,

24:32.359 --> 24:34.425
she dies.

25:16.207 --> 25:17.674
Excuse me, ma'am.

25:17.676 --> 25:20.744
Would you and your daughter
mind stepping out of the car?

25:31.323 --> 25:33.357
She's in there, but
you better hurry.

25:33.359 --> 25:35.559
Okay. Thanks.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.234
Heather, I'm Erin Reagan.

25:44.236 --> 25:45.669
I'm with the
DA's office.

25:45.671 --> 25:47.938
You got no right
keeping me here like this.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.139
No right at all.

25:49.141 --> 25:53.243
You're absolutely correct,
and I apologize.

25:53.245 --> 25:55.679
I have done nothing wrong,
I haven't broken any laws.

25:55.681 --> 25:58.482
I should be free to go
wherever and whenever I please.

25:58.484 --> 26:00.050
That's true,
and you are.

26:00.052 --> 26:02.052
So I can leave?
Absolutely.

26:02.054 --> 26:04.388
I just wish you would
listen to what I have to say.

26:04.390 --> 26:06.690
I know what you have to say.

26:06.692 --> 26:08.792
I'm a mother, too...
of an only child--

26:08.794 --> 26:10.327
a daughter, just like you--

26:10.329 --> 26:13.230
so, I know a little bit
of what you must be feeling.

26:13.232 --> 26:16.400
Then you should know better
than to ask what you're asking.

26:16.402 --> 26:18.368
You have a point.

26:18.370 --> 26:19.870
And if the tables
were turned,

26:19.872 --> 26:21.438
I'd probably say exactly
what you're thinking,

26:21.440 --> 26:23.940
which is,
"Get lost, take a hike."

26:23.942 --> 26:25.909
I'm sorry.

26:25.911 --> 26:28.011
I really am.

26:28.013 --> 26:31.314
I do not want that
police officer to die, but...

26:31.316 --> 26:34.050
but I cannot put my daughter
in that situation.

26:34.052 --> 26:35.719
I'm sorry, I just can't.

26:35.721 --> 26:36.987
It's not

26:36.989 --> 26:41.425
just Detective Baez's life
at stake here.

26:41.427 --> 26:43.026
Typically, these things

26:43.028 --> 26:44.494
do not end well.

26:44.496 --> 26:48.498
There's a very good chance your
husband is going to die today.

26:51.369 --> 26:53.603
Miss Reagan...

26:53.605 --> 26:55.639
I am not a heartless person,

26:55.641 --> 26:57.707
but Anthony is not well.

26:57.709 --> 27:02.245
I have tried to save him

27:02.247 --> 27:05.282
more times
than I care to count,

27:05.284 --> 27:07.551
and I just can't do it anymore.

27:07.553 --> 27:09.653
Okay.

27:09.655 --> 27:11.588
But Penelope can.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.657
Will she ever
forgive you

27:13.659 --> 27:16.893
if you deny her the chance
to save her father's life?

27:16.895 --> 27:18.695
How dare you?!

27:18.697 --> 27:22.632
How dare you put that on me?!

27:26.504 --> 27:28.171
En route from where?

27:28.173 --> 27:29.873
What's the ETA?

27:31.108 --> 27:34.377
Calling you right back. Boss.
Go.

27:34.379 --> 27:36.613
Still no shots fired.
It's about the guy's daughter,

27:36.615 --> 27:38.482
a custody case.

27:38.484 --> 27:40.383
Trying to bring the mother
and daughter to the scene.

27:40.385 --> 27:41.585
How far out?

27:41.587 --> 27:42.619
Up by the GW.

27:42.621 --> 27:43.720
Order an escort.

27:43.722 --> 27:45.088
It's already been done.

27:53.064 --> 27:55.899
You talk to Garrett?

27:55.901 --> 27:57.868
Yeah, all the time.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.569
About his stepson.

27:59.571 --> 28:01.505
Oh. Yes, sir.

28:01.507 --> 28:03.773
He came to you first.

28:03.775 --> 28:05.442
Not for the favor.

28:05.444 --> 28:07.777
Just for the support
in asking you for it.

28:07.779 --> 28:09.713
It's not the first time
he's used pull,

28:09.715 --> 28:10.914
nor even the fourth.

28:10.916 --> 28:13.183
Yeah, I know, Commissioner.

28:14.952 --> 28:18.388
Would you have pulled
the collar if you were me?

28:18.390 --> 28:21.958
Not a fair question, all due respect.
Why not?

28:21.960 --> 28:24.261
Well, clearly, I'm not you, and
I don't have that relationship

28:24.263 --> 28:25.896
with Garrett that you have.

28:25.898 --> 28:29.199
Oh, come on, Sid,
give me a straight answer.

28:29.201 --> 28:31.835
Absolutely I'd help out.

28:31.837 --> 28:35.205
But I'm a sucker for people
trying to help their kids out.

28:35.207 --> 28:38.475
And anybody who knows you
knows you're not.

28:38.477 --> 28:40.410
No, that came out wrong.

28:40.412 --> 28:44.414
I mean, um, boss,
you're built differently.

28:44.416 --> 28:47.250
And anybody who knows
any of your kids,

28:47.252 --> 28:49.553
how they turned out--
they'd wish

28:49.555 --> 28:50.854
they could have talked to you

28:50.856 --> 28:52.556
when they were raising
their own.

28:58.930 --> 29:01.331
Hour's almost up.

29:01.333 --> 29:04.668
It's time to tell him
Penelope's not coming.

29:06.237 --> 29:08.905
But I want you to know,

29:08.907 --> 29:10.907
if he doesn't take it well,

29:10.909 --> 29:14.344
I've given ESU the green
light to take their shot.

29:14.346 --> 29:16.947
It's the right call.

29:19.250 --> 29:21.418
Okay.

29:23.422 --> 29:24.788
Wait a minute.

29:24.790 --> 29:26.122
Bless me, Father,

29:26.124 --> 29:27.991
for I have sinned.

29:27.993 --> 29:30.894
It's been four months
since my last confession, and...

29:30.896 --> 29:32.696
What are you doing?

29:32.698 --> 29:33.930
I'm saying confession.

29:33.932 --> 29:35.999
Here? Now?

29:36.001 --> 29:39.135
Whatever happens, I want
to have a clear conscience.

29:39.137 --> 29:40.804
You're Catholic,
huh? Just like me.

29:40.806 --> 29:42.172
Yeah.

29:43.874 --> 29:45.475
Oh, she's running a game.

29:45.477 --> 29:47.177
She's conning him.
It's all an act.

29:48.980 --> 29:51.781
When was the last time
you went to confession?

29:51.783 --> 29:54.451
Huh. Too long.

29:55.286 --> 29:57.187
Come.

29:58.289 --> 30:01.024
Sit with me.

30:01.026 --> 30:03.326
We can... we can do it together.

30:03.328 --> 30:05.695
No. No, I...

30:05.697 --> 30:07.030
I-I don't...

30:07.032 --> 30:09.032
It's okay.

30:09.034 --> 30:11.234
Just... it's okay.

30:13.437 --> 30:14.671
Please.

30:14.673 --> 30:17.140
Please.

30:17.975 --> 30:20.010
We got to go.
What?

30:20.012 --> 30:21.077
She's making her move right now.

30:21.079 --> 30:22.846
Come on, we got to help.

30:27.151 --> 30:29.386
We could just pray, okay?

30:29.388 --> 30:30.787
Here, take my hand.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.359
Our Father,

30:36.361 --> 30:39.362
Who art in heaven,
who art in heaven,

30:39.364 --> 30:40.430
hallowed be thy name.

30:40.432 --> 30:42.666
Thy kingdom come,

30:42.668 --> 30:44.034
thy will be done,

30:44.036 --> 30:45.902
on earth as it is in heaven.

30:45.904 --> 30:47.904
Give us this day
our daily bread,

30:47.906 --> 30:50.006
and forgive us our trespasses

30:50.008 --> 30:52.308
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

30:52.310 --> 30:54.577
and lead us not into temptation,

30:54.579 --> 30:57.280
but deliver us from evil.

31:00.419 --> 31:02.285
Go!

31:07.259 --> 31:09.459
Get out!

31:09.461 --> 31:11.061
Don't move!

31:24.545 --> 31:26.645
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- Hold fire. Hold fire.

31:26.647 --> 31:28.447
Nice and easy,

31:28.449 --> 31:29.415
give me your gun.

31:29.417 --> 31:30.483
Now!

31:30.485 --> 31:32.218
I can't give you my gun.

31:32.220 --> 31:33.652
Do you want to die today?

31:33.654 --> 31:36.155
I'm not giving you my gun.
If you don't give me your gun,

31:36.157 --> 31:38.758
you're going to make me
use mine. Back off!

31:38.760 --> 31:39.959
Back up! Back up!

31:39.961 --> 31:42.561
Give me your gun!
Tell you what I'll do.

31:42.563 --> 31:45.464
I'll put this right
on the floor.

31:45.466 --> 31:46.565
I'll lay on top of it,

31:46.567 --> 31:48.467
arms and hands
where you can see them

31:48.469 --> 31:49.702
so I can't grab it
or do nothing.

31:49.704 --> 31:51.504
You do what you want after that.

31:51.506 --> 31:52.938
But I'm not giving you my gun.

31:52.940 --> 31:55.641
You think I'm stupid?
No.

31:55.643 --> 31:57.243
You think I don't have the balls
to shoot you, is that it?

31:57.245 --> 31:58.644
I didn't say that.

31:58.646 --> 32:00.045
You're giving me no choice.

32:00.047 --> 32:03.649
If you don't give me your gun,
I am going to shoot you.

32:06.052 --> 32:08.254
I'm not giving you my gun

32:08.256 --> 32:10.723
so you have to do
what you got to do.

32:14.996 --> 32:16.695
As you wish.

32:16.697 --> 32:18.831
Got your daughter here!

32:18.833 --> 32:20.666
Daddy!
Penelope?!

32:27.107 --> 32:28.107
Stay down.

32:28.109 --> 32:29.408
Get in there!
Come on.

32:29.410 --> 32:30.676
Come on.
Suspect down.

32:30.678 --> 32:32.878
Restrain him.

32:40.453 --> 32:42.621
Commissioner.

32:43.890 --> 32:45.658
Got a minute?

32:45.660 --> 32:49.495
Sorry, no, I do not.

32:53.066 --> 32:54.466
What's this?

32:54.468 --> 32:56.869
The who, what,
why, when, where

32:56.871 --> 32:58.537
on the outcome at the 5-4.

32:58.539 --> 33:02.408
I scheduled a briefing
for half an hour from now

33:02.410 --> 33:05.444
and I've asked Tomlinson
to do the hand-off for me.

33:05.446 --> 33:07.112
Because you're where?

33:07.114 --> 33:08.147
Sam's arraignment.

33:08.149 --> 33:11.083
Meeting his lawyer,
posting bail.

33:11.952 --> 33:13.819
Anything you need?

33:13.821 --> 33:14.987
Nope.

33:14.989 --> 33:16.222
I could at least...

33:16.224 --> 33:17.890
Nothing. Thank you.

33:17.892 --> 33:19.558
I'm going to walk him through
the processing

33:19.560 --> 33:21.760
as far as I can go
and that's all.

33:23.731 --> 33:27.099
I'm sorry for your troubles,
Garrett.

33:27.101 --> 33:29.501
I really am.

33:30.337 --> 33:32.738
Thank you for that.

33:32.740 --> 33:36.108
And I'm not on any moral
high ground here.

33:36.110 --> 33:40.212
I'm just trying to say
that I understand.

33:40.214 --> 33:43.515
More than you know.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.352
Don't get me wrong,

33:46.354 --> 33:49.688
you own a lot
of that high moral ground.

33:49.690 --> 33:52.391
Well bought and fully paid for.

33:52.393 --> 33:54.226
Cut it out.

33:54.228 --> 33:57.396
As you own what's right
for you and yours.

33:57.398 --> 33:59.632
But nobody's idea
of what is right

33:59.634 --> 34:03.402
is everybody's idea
of what is right.

34:04.237 --> 34:06.538
I know that.

34:09.009 --> 34:13.913
I have a blind spot
where Sam is concerned.

34:13.915 --> 34:16.982
And a whole lot of coulda,
woulda, shoulda's.

34:16.984 --> 34:21.719
And I'm left with a deeply
flawed way of showing him love,

34:21.722 --> 34:23.822
but it's what I know.

34:27.761 --> 34:30.896
I could try to make it tougher,

34:30.898 --> 34:33.264
more pragmatic,
but I'm pretty sure by now

34:33.266 --> 34:35.266
it just is what it is.

34:40.206 --> 34:42.141
See you Monday.

34:46.246 --> 34:48.981
Good luck to both of you.

34:55.755 --> 34:57.823
She really saved his life,

34:57.825 --> 34:59.391
didn't she?

34:59.393 --> 35:01.493
She saved mine, too.

35:02.963 --> 35:04.496
Thank you.

35:04.498 --> 35:06.465
It wasn't me.

35:08.702 --> 35:10.602
How long does it take

35:10.604 --> 35:13.172
until the hurt and anger
start to go away?

35:13.174 --> 35:16.308
Longer than it should,

35:16.310 --> 35:18.610
but what you did here today,

35:18.612 --> 35:21.480
it's a really big step.

35:23.116 --> 35:25.551
Why did you do it, Daddy?

35:26.419 --> 35:28.654
I wasn't thinking, sweetie.

35:28.656 --> 35:30.656
I was scared.

35:30.658 --> 35:32.658
I was...

35:32.660 --> 35:35.527
scared I would never
see you again.

35:37.230 --> 35:39.264
Daddy's not well.

35:39.266 --> 35:40.966
I need help.

35:41.801 --> 35:44.837
I want to be better for you.

35:46.239 --> 35:47.873
Time to say good-bye.

35:49.109 --> 35:51.276
I love you.

35:51.278 --> 35:54.179
Will I ever see you again?

35:56.750 --> 35:59.151
Of course you will.

36:00.153 --> 36:02.354
He's your father.

36:08.895 --> 36:10.496
Okay, thank you.

36:10.498 --> 36:11.997
You're welcome.

36:15.101 --> 36:17.202
Thanks for taking
my spot in there.

36:17.204 --> 36:18.570
How you doing?

36:18.572 --> 36:21.040
Just another day at
the office, partner.

36:21.042 --> 36:24.076
You were tough as nails
in there and very brave.

36:24.078 --> 36:26.011
You saved my life.

36:26.013 --> 36:27.379
Oh, I know I did,

36:27.381 --> 36:29.014
and you owe me.

36:29.016 --> 36:31.016
Whatever I say,
whenever I say it from now on.

36:31.018 --> 36:32.518
What?!
Oh, yeah.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.253
In your dreams, Reagan.

36:45.965 --> 36:47.599
Mrs. Jackson.

36:47.601 --> 36:49.568
Can we have a moment?

36:49.570 --> 36:51.703
Mrs. Jackson, we, um,

36:51.705 --> 36:54.306
wanted to give you this.

36:54.308 --> 36:56.275
What?

37:02.816 --> 37:05.117
Oh, my.

37:09.756 --> 37:11.957
Th-This is a lot of money.

37:11.959 --> 37:15.094
$2,552.

37:15.096 --> 37:17.162
Officer Janko

37:17.164 --> 37:19.598
was able to get every cop
in the precinct to do his part.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.233
Well, we're still
a little short,

37:21.235 --> 37:23.102
but a new tour
comes on shortly

37:23.104 --> 37:24.837
and I'll be waiting for them.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.841
I can't believe
you really did this for me.

37:28.843 --> 37:30.742
Everything okay
over here, Alice?

37:30.744 --> 37:33.078
Everything is fine.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.380
I'm just...

37:35.382 --> 37:38.117
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude.

37:39.586 --> 37:40.886
Thank you.

37:40.888 --> 37:42.287
What's going on?

37:42.289 --> 37:43.689
Now she has enough money

37:43.691 --> 37:45.958
to afford a proper burial
for her husband.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.527
Because of these two
thoughtful souls.

37:48.529 --> 37:49.761
Is that true?

37:49.763 --> 37:51.163
The cops raised
the money?

37:51.165 --> 37:52.498
Yes, they did.

37:57.437 --> 37:58.737
Oh.

37:58.739 --> 38:00.272
Thank you.
You're welcome.

38:03.743 --> 38:06.278
Thank you.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.480
Look at that.

38:09.449 --> 38:11.517
Oh.

38:11.519 --> 38:13.185
Bless you.

38:14.721 --> 38:16.622
Thank you.

38:18.525 --> 38:20.225
Good people.

38:20.227 --> 38:22.161
Thank you. Thank you.

38:26.232 --> 38:27.432
Give me a call.

38:27.434 --> 38:29.835
I'll give you what you want.

38:30.436 --> 38:32.304
Thank you.

38:45.952 --> 38:47.071
<i>Okay, so</i>

38:47.072 --> 38:48.638
whose turn is it to say grace?

38:48.640 --> 38:50.506
Not me.
I said it last week.

38:50.508 --> 38:51.958
- I think it's Nicky's turn.
- Is not.

38:51.959 --> 38:53.409
- Come on, Nicky.
- Come on, Mom.

38:53.411 --> 38:56.292
I'll say grace.
Uh, no, please no.

38:56.293 --> 38:58.226
Some of us are starving.

38:58.228 --> 39:00.195
What is that supposed to mean?
It means your grace

39:00.196 --> 39:02.763
can take longer than
an Allman Brothers song.

39:02.766 --> 39:04.232
I don't do that.

39:04.234 --> 39:06.034
Yeah, you do.
Yes, you do.

39:06.036 --> 39:07.536
All right, hold on a second.

39:07.538 --> 39:10.639
Is there anyone at this table
who is not grateful today?

39:10.641 --> 39:12.707
If only for the fact that we are

39:12.708 --> 39:17.812
all together again this Sunday,
safe and sound?

39:19.615 --> 39:22.551
I know I am.

39:28.191 --> 39:30.358
Okay, let's all
say grace together then.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.441
What a great idea.

39:31.442 --> 39:32.412
Let's join hands.

39:32.413 --> 39:33.578
Absolutely not.

39:34.379 --> 39:36.479
Every man for himself.

39:37.651 --> 39:41.419
Bless us, O Lord,
and these thy gifts

39:41.422 --> 39:43.923
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty.

39:43.925 --> 39:45.224
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
