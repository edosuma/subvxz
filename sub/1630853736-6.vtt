20:09.625 --> 20:11.543
Really? Just like that?

20:11.627 --> 20:15.339
Um, well, there's a scripture
that talks about forgiving

20:15.422 --> 20:16.965
someone seven times.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.469
But Jesus says the new teaching
is, I tell you, um,

20:20.552 --> 20:22.971
seven-- 70 times seven.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.934
-Um...
-Is that 77 times seven.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.727
And then Peter came up
to him and said, "Lord,

20:28.810 --> 20:30.354
how often shall my brother
sin against me

20:30.437 --> 20:32.105
and I forgive him?"

20:32.189 --> 20:35.359
"As many as seven times."
And then Jesus said,

20:35.442 --> 20:37.235
"I do not say to you
seven times,

20:37.319 --> 20:39.237
but 70 times seven."

20:39.321 --> 20:41.114
So, it's like
if we have to forgive

20:41.198 --> 20:44.534
our neighbor that much,
and we have to love ourselves

20:44.618 --> 20:46.954
like we love our neighbor,
then we also have

20:47.037 --> 20:48.830
to forgive ourselves that much.

20:52.834 --> 20:53.919
