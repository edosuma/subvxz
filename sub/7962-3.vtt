08:50.406 --> 08:52.839
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

08:52.841 --> 08:54.875
(whooping)
Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

08:54.877 --> 08:58.111
This is so great. I can't thank
you enough. I feel alive again.

08:58.113 --> 09:00.948
And look at all the cans.
We're gonna be rich!
You got to drop it

09:00.950 --> 09:03.050
with the cans, all right?
Nobody cares about the cans.
Really. Yep.

09:03.052 --> 09:04.952
Oh, okay, well, what about...

09:04.954 --> 09:06.687
these cans?
Oh! Oh, my God!

09:06.689 --> 09:09.022
You can't do that!
You can't do that.

09:09.024 --> 09:11.959
Though they don't seem to mind.
They look like
they're really enjoying it.

09:11.961 --> 09:13.226
Yeah, mountain rules, baby!

09:13.228 --> 09:15.796
Everybody get your tits out!

09:15.798 --> 09:17.898
(cheering)
Hell yes!

09:17.900 --> 09:19.967
He just said,
"Take your tits out,"
Yeah.

09:19.969 --> 09:22.903
and they all just
took their tits out.
Yeah, I'm gonna keep mine in,

09:22.905 --> 09:24.938
just for now.
(music stops)

09:27.376 --> 09:30.310
Party's over, burnout.
Whoops.

09:30.312 --> 09:32.079
Frank Reynolds.

09:32.081 --> 09:33.447
Wow.

09:33.449 --> 09:35.082
It's been...

09:35.084 --> 09:37.117
30 years to the day.

09:37.119 --> 09:38.819
How they hanging, Drisko?

09:38.821 --> 09:42.089
Uh, I lost one of 'em.
Prostate thing. You know.

09:42.091 --> 09:44.925
Yeah, yeah, me, too. It's
still bouncing around in there,

09:44.927 --> 09:47.327
but it don't do nothing.
I'm gonna stop this.

09:47.329 --> 09:49.630
You guys know each other?
We skied together.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.466
This mountain wasn't big enough
for both of us.

09:52.468 --> 09:55.402
Loser of the big race
was banned for 30 years.

09:55.404 --> 09:57.804
Looks like old Frank here
let his mouth write a check

09:57.806 --> 09:59.106
his ass couldn't cash.

09:59.108 --> 10:01.141
(crowd oohing)

10:03.112 --> 10:06.113
Well, I just wrote
another check.

10:06.115 --> 10:08.949
To buy the mountain.
(crowd groaning)

10:08.951 --> 10:11.685
How 'bout we race
for the mountain?

10:11.687 --> 10:13.620
Or are you scared
you'll lose?

10:13.622 --> 10:15.355
(crowd oohing)

10:15.357 --> 10:18.792
I don't race no more.

10:18.794 --> 10:21.695
I let my son race for me.

10:21.697 --> 10:23.363
Oh...!

10:23.365 --> 10:25.198
Really?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.800
Your son, huh?

10:26.802 --> 10:28.268
Don't think
you can beat me?

10:28.270 --> 10:30.504
Oh, I'll beat you.

10:30.506 --> 10:33.173
You better go enjoy your party
while it lasts.

10:33.175 --> 10:36.043
It's gonna be your last one.

10:36.045 --> 10:38.345
Burnout.

10:38.347 --> 10:41.448
(cackles)

10:47.489 --> 10:49.623
MAN (over P.A.): Last day
to squeeze in some turns

10:49.625 --> 10:52.225
before tomorrow's big race.
On a side note,

10:52.227 --> 10:54.227
it's good to see Frank Reynolds
back on the hill.

10:54.229 --> 10:57.230
We'll see if he can patch things
up with old rival Dave Drisko.

10:57.232 --> 10:58.999
But I wouldn't count on it.

10:59.001 --> 11:01.568
Yo, hey, Dennis, did
you just hear that?
What?

11:01.570 --> 11:04.004
The-the P.A. announcement.
What-what was that?

11:04.006 --> 11:06.206
Well, there's a lot of people
on this mountain, Charlie.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.308
Everybody's gotta stay informed.
Yeah, but that guy
was, like, saying

11:08.310 --> 11:09.976
a bunch of, like, really
personal information about us.

11:09.978 --> 11:12.345
Like, how does he know that?
Right. That's how it works.

11:12.347 --> 11:14.414
Why's he talking about us?
There's, like, hundreds
of people out here.

11:14.416 --> 11:16.249
Well, we're the most
important thing that's
happening right now.

11:16.251 --> 11:18.251
What?
Look, I-I think
I got something

11:18.253 --> 11:21.388
that's gonna clear this all up
for you. Meet my race team.

11:23.859 --> 11:25.392
Where'd these
guys come from?

11:25.394 --> 11:27.060
Switzerland?

11:27.062 --> 11:29.429
Yeah, but they came here and
they're racing with us?

11:29.431 --> 11:31.331
I don't... I-I don't
understand that at all.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.100
Well, I needed somebody
to be behind me.

11:33.102 --> 11:34.768
I mean, this guy's my...
kind of my captain,

11:34.770 --> 11:36.670
and these guys are my goons,
you know? If I need 'em

11:36.672 --> 11:38.271
to do something for me,
back me up, you know,

11:38.273 --> 11:39.906
if I'm getting into some...
And... they just

11:39.908 --> 11:41.374
showed up and they're
racing with you?

11:41.376 --> 11:43.176
Yeah.

11:43.178 --> 11:44.911
All right. No
more questions.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.748
Okay, good. All right.
Uh, yeah, I-I...
Okay. (scoffs)

11:47.750 --> 11:49.683
All right, now,
listen up, guys.

11:49.685 --> 11:51.284
Tomorrow's the big race.

11:51.286 --> 11:54.955
And anything less than first
place will not be tolerated.

11:54.957 --> 11:57.424
In fact,
it'll be punished.

11:57.426 --> 12:00.861
But, remember,
I want you to have fun.

12:00.863 --> 12:03.296
But not if it means you're not
gonna get first place.

12:03.298 --> 12:05.265
'Cause I'll-I'll punish you.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.435
All right, now go limber up, and
I'll-I'll meet you at the chair.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.737
Let's go, guys.
March, march, march.

12:10.739 --> 12:13.874
Wow. Uh, I got to
hand it to you,

12:13.876 --> 12:15.976
looks like you got
a pretty good team.

12:15.978 --> 12:18.645
I think so, too.
Yeah, yeah. Uh, look,
I don't... I don't get

12:18.647 --> 12:21.381
anything that's happening.
So, uh, I'm out,

12:21.383 --> 12:23.216
you know what I mean? And maybe
we should drink some beer,

12:23.218 --> 12:24.618
eat some snow, and just...

12:24.620 --> 12:27.120
(bottle shatters)
What the hell, man?

12:27.122 --> 12:28.822
I'm disappointed in you.

12:28.824 --> 12:30.791
I thought you were a champion.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.560
Why?
You showed me
some real stuff out there, guy.

12:33.562 --> 12:35.595
I was falling.
You were falling,
but you were fast.

12:35.597 --> 12:37.631
But I crashed
into some tables.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.666
Crashing and exploding is all
part of the learning curve.

12:39.668 --> 12:41.134
I could turn you
into a champion,

12:41.136 --> 12:42.969
but that's clearly
not what you want.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.739
You want to just be
a burnout and a loser
like those other guys.

12:45.741 --> 12:47.073
Dude, I don't even
understand you, man.

12:47.075 --> 12:48.175
Just, like,
take it easy...

12:48.177 --> 12:49.309
Where are those coming from?

12:49.311 --> 12:51.111
I'm out, dude.

12:51.113 --> 12:53.480
Like, it's crazy to me.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.981
I'm gonna hang out
with Mac and Dee

12:54.983 --> 12:56.850
and see if I can
figure them out, man...

12:56.852 --> 12:59.352
Oh, yeah, yeah. Go hang with
those other two burnout losers.

12:59.354 --> 13:01.087
Yeah, go ahead. You know
what your problem is, buddy?

13:01.089 --> 13:03.323
You got no allegiance.
We're here for two days!

13:03.325 --> 13:05.859
MAN (over P.A.):
Looks like Charlie Kelly's
walking off the mountain

13:05.861 --> 13:07.961
and out of the big race,
ladies and gentlemen.

13:07.963 --> 13:09.596

13:10.532 --> 13:12.199

Oh, yeah. Here we go.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.305
Take a look.

13:18.307 --> 13:20.507
Oh, wow!

13:20.509 --> 13:22.342
Can you see through the wall?
Yeah. Yeah,
you can see right through.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.878
Okay, I think I'm
getting it. Yeah.
Yeah? Okay.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.815
Hey! I heard your guys' voices.
What are you guys doing in here?
DEE and MAC: Hey!

13:28.817 --> 13:31.518
We are in the middle of a prank
war with Frank and Dennis.
Yeah.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.220
All right, nice. What's
the prank? What's the prank?

13:33.222 --> 13:34.654
We're drilling a hole
in the women's shower

13:34.656 --> 13:36.857
so we can look at 'em naked.
Yeah.

13:36.859 --> 13:40.327
(laughing)
Why? What-what does that have
to do with Frank and Dennis?

13:40.329 --> 13:42.195
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, nothing, really.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.798
It's just a warm-up prank
to get the juices flowing.
Yeah!

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
(chuckling)
Warm-up. We're warming up.

13:46.802 --> 13:48.702
I don't want to be a bummer,
but I kind of

13:48.704 --> 13:51.304
don't get how spying
on naked, unaware women

13:51.306 --> 13:53.640
is a prank at all.
MAC:
Me, either.

13:53.642 --> 13:55.475
Me, either. Me, either.
Well, the real prank

13:55.477 --> 13:57.544
DEE: Mm-hmm.
is when I jam my
dick through that hole

13:57.546 --> 13:59.379
and yell, "Special
delivery!"

13:59.381 --> 14:01.748
Oh, dude, I don't think so.
CHARLIE:
Oh, no.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.050
You can't do that, man.
You'd get in a lot of trouble
for something like that.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.585
That's, like... Yeah.
Maybe we can just

14:05.587 --> 14:07.754
do something that doesn't
involve naked women.

14:07.756 --> 14:10.423
Just... You know, 'cause
that's not fun for me.

14:10.425 --> 14:12.192
How 'bout if I
show you my dick?

14:12.194 --> 14:13.260
Why would I want that?

14:13.262 --> 14:15.028
Oh, okay, okay, it's a prank

14:15.030 --> 14:17.530
if you don't want to see it
but he shows you anyway.

14:17.532 --> 14:20.333
This guy gets it.
It's gonna be hilarious.
I think I get it.

14:20.335 --> 14:22.869
I'm gonna get myself hard,
and I will show you what I mean.

14:22.871 --> 14:24.738
Hold on a sec.
Oh.
Oh.

14:29.711 --> 14:32.712
Oh, you bastard! You know what,
if you guys are already hard,

14:32.714 --> 14:35.782
just go ahead of me and
I'll-I'll just circle back.

14:35.784 --> 14:38.251
Oh, God.

Welcome to the annual big race.

17:20.515 --> 17:23.883
(crowd groans, laughter)

17:23.885 --> 17:26.052
This guy might not be as
cool as we thought he was.

17:26.054 --> 17:27.687
Even his awesome hair
is bullshit.

17:27.689 --> 17:29.456
You forgot one charge.
What's that?

17:29.458 --> 17:31.191
Assaulting an officer!

17:31.193 --> 17:33.593
Never stop partying!

17:33.595 --> 17:34.694
Oh!

17:38.300 --> 17:40.100
That'll do.
You know?
If I'm being honest,

17:40.102 --> 17:41.367
he probably deserves it.
Yeah.

17:41.369 --> 17:43.870
Never stop partying, bitches.

17:43.872 --> 17:45.805
Never stop partying!

17:45.807 --> 17:47.474
So...

17:47.476 --> 17:50.376
which one of you losers wants
to win a silver medal?

17:50.378 --> 17:52.312
Ugh. Not me--
I got blasted last night.

17:52.314 --> 17:54.280
I'm so sick.
I don't feel
good, either.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.615
I'd also like
to remove myself

17:55.617 --> 17:57.417
from the sexual
predator team.

17:57.419 --> 17:59.052
MAN (over P.A.):
Well, I guess that does it.

17:59.054 --> 18:01.621
The winner by default
of the annual big race is...

18:01.623 --> 18:03.389
CHARLIE:
Not so fast!

18:03.391 --> 18:04.791
(crowd oohing)

18:04.793 --> 18:06.726
(chuckles)

18:06.728 --> 18:08.261
This is good.

18:08.263 --> 18:10.430
So you gonna race for them?

18:10.432 --> 18:12.298
No, Dennis, I'm gonna
race for everyone.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.434
I want to race
for the people.

18:14.436 --> 18:16.669
(whooping, cheering)
You see, last night
Tatiana taught me

18:16.671 --> 18:18.238
all about Communism.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.573
Cold, hard winters,
gross soups.

18:20.575 --> 18:23.276
She also taught me
a lot about sex.

18:23.278 --> 18:24.811
Sweet sex, amazing sex,

18:24.813 --> 18:26.913
a lot of sex,

DEE: All right.

20:13.555 --> 20:15.555
The mountain is ours, Frank!

20:15.557 --> 20:16.889
(laughing)

20:16.891 --> 20:19.459
Uh... not exactly.

20:19.461 --> 20:20.793
Uh...

20:20.795 --> 20:22.962
actually, uh...
the whole Snow Palace thing

20:22.964 --> 20:24.864
was, uh, all for show.

20:24.866 --> 20:26.933
(groans)
Huh?

20:26.935 --> 20:29.636
I needed to distract the local
environmentalist groups

20:29.638 --> 20:32.405
while I fracked the mountain.

20:32.407 --> 20:35.141
Wh-Wh... What?!
You fracked the mountain?

20:35.143 --> 20:37.076
Yeah. Yeah,
the banquet, the race--

20:37.078 --> 20:38.611
it was all set up.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.613
It was just a diversion,
it was...

20:40.615 --> 20:43.916
a distraction, because
I wanted to get into this hill

20:43.918 --> 20:46.619
and suck out
its natural resources.

20:46.621 --> 20:49.255
So all this here was
just one big setup?

20:49.257 --> 20:51.557
Yeah.
I hired the hookers,

20:51.559 --> 20:54.160
so you could rip
their tops off.
That makes sense.

20:54.162 --> 20:56.763
Oh...
That makes a
lot of sense.

20:56.765 --> 20:59.132
So what do we do now?
I'm good. You want to...

20:59.134 --> 21:00.800
you want to stick around,
it's okay.
No.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.502
It'd be good to go back to
Philly, right? I mean...

21:02.504 --> 21:04.070
I'm pretty tired.
It was quite a weekend.

21:04.072 --> 21:05.471
Honestly, I don't even
like skiing that much.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.141
(groaning): I-I need to go
see a doctor.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.942
Yeah, I should probably see a
doctor, too, actually, I guess,

21:09.944 --> 21:11.477
if Tatiana
was a hooker.
Oh, yeah.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.945
Oh, God, gross.
Yeah.
That's not good.

21:12.947 --> 21:14.847
Help. (groans)

MAN (over P.A.):

we'll all be out of jobs.

hire<i> that</i> guy?

21:23.825 --> 21:27.126
You know, Charlie, I have
no idea who that guy is.

21:27.128 --> 21:31.998
Huh. I guess some things really
