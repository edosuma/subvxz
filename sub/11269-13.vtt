WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:04.085
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.953
This particular kind of granite

00:05.954 --> 00:07.188
comes from Barre, Vermont.

00:07.189 --> 00:08.623
Get out-
Barre? Yeah.

00:08.624 --> 00:09.924
Yeah, you can take a tour

00:09.925 --> 00:11.192
of their whole
operation up there.

00:11.193 --> 00:13.161
Yeah?
Yeah, ask for a guy named Asa.

00:13.162 --> 00:15.062
Yeah?
Yeah, you can tell him I sent you.

00:15.063 --> 00:16.297
He'll, uh...
he'll do you right.

00:16.297 --> 00:17.532
He'll set me up?
Oh, sure.

00:17.533 --> 00:18.899
You see, it's got the, uh...

00:21.003 --> 00:22.403
(both chuckling)

00:22.404 --> 00:23.455
Excuse me, sir?

00:23.456 --> 00:25.657
Hey, hey, yo.
Sir.

00:25.691 --> 00:27.959
This man obviously
mistook the uniform

00:27.960 --> 00:29.627
of the United States
Postal Service

00:29.628 --> 00:31.396
for one of the common
valet there, Norm.

00:31.397 --> 00:32.729
Now that you mention it, Cliff,

00:32.731 --> 00:34.466
you know...
Mistake or not, though, the man

00:34.467 --> 00:36.168
has entrusted a
valuable possession

00:36.169 --> 00:38.103
to one who proudly
wears this uniform.

00:38.104 --> 00:40.238
As long as that man is
in that restaurant,

00:40.239 --> 00:42.274
I-I cannot shirk
the responsibility

00:42.308 --> 00:44.242
he has laid upon
these shoulders.

00:44.243 --> 00:45.910
What are you gonna do,
just hang here

00:45.911 --> 00:47.841
for a couple hours
while the guy eats?

00:48.497 --> 00:50.615
Norm, my friend,
this is a Jaguar.

00:50.649 --> 00:52.783
Jaguar plus postman equals...

00:52.818 --> 00:53.985
adventure.

00:54.019 --> 00:55.737
Let's do it.
(laughing)

01:02.078 --> 01:03.344

02:19.472 --> 02:21.042
Hey, Cliffie, what you doing?

02:21.057 --> 02:22.791
I'm filling out an application

02:22.792 --> 02:23.992
for the Boston Marathon.

02:23.993 --> 02:25.727
It's, uh, something
I do every year.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.762
Wait a minute, you run
in the Boston Marathon?

02:27.763 --> 02:29.831
No, no, I just get
the free T-shirt.

02:29.865 --> 02:32.366
It, uh, impresses the
girls down at the gym.

02:32.401 --> 02:33.568
Ah.

02:33.569 --> 02:35.970
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
you-you work out in a gym?

02:35.971 --> 02:37.105
Well, no, I just hang out

02:37.106 --> 02:38.206
in front with
the T-shirt.

02:38.207 --> 02:39.473
Oh.

02:39.474 --> 02:41.459
FRASIER:
Hey, listen to this.

02:41.460 --> 02:42.794
According to the TV Guide,

02:42.795 --> 02:44.629
they're playing
an old Red Sox game

02:44.663 --> 02:46.230
on Play Ball later.

02:46.265 --> 02:47.548
What is Play Ball?

02:47.549 --> 02:49.350
Well, it's, uh, this show
on channel 58.

02:49.351 --> 02:51.820
They replay
classic Red Sox games.

02:51.854 --> 02:53.121
Hey, say, listen, Sam?

02:53.155 --> 02:54.990
This is one of your games.

02:55.024 --> 02:58.726
Yeah, July 14, 1975,
relief pitcher, Sam Malone.

02:58.727 --> 02:59.961
CLIFF:
Hey, Sammy, what do you say

02:59.962 --> 03:01.613
we make an evening
out of it, huh?

03:01.614 --> 03:03.180
Yeah, popcorn, pretzels, beer.

03:03.181 --> 03:04.631
Gather around the old TV set.

03:04.632 --> 03:06.518
All right, sounds like a
nice change of pace.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.219
Yeah.

03:08.253 --> 03:09.604
Yeah, what the hell?

03:09.605 --> 03:11.006
That sounds like a nice idea.

03:11.007 --> 03:12.057
Say, honey,

03:12.058 --> 03:12.941
can you do me a favour?

03:12.942 --> 03:14.025
Can you hand me the, uh,

03:14.026 --> 03:16.294
baseball almanac under the bar?

03:18.029 --> 03:20.698
Uh, I was drinking a lot
back in those days,

03:20.733 --> 03:23.834
and there's something
about 1975 I don't remember.

03:23.869 --> 03:25.069
What's that?

03:25.103 --> 03:27.288
The summer part.

03:27.323 --> 03:29.490
I-I-I don't want them
seeing a game

03:29.491 --> 03:30.608
where I embarrass myself.

03:30.609 --> 03:31.910
All right, here we go.

03:31.944 --> 03:35.279
July... July 14, '75.

03:35.314 --> 03:37.014
Red Sox versus the Orioles.

03:37.049 --> 03:38.616
Red Sox won.

03:38.651 --> 03:39.918
Oh, right.

03:39.952 --> 03:41.218
I pitched three innings.

03:41.253 --> 03:42.821
I must have been okay that day.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.489
Good.
Yeah.

03:44.523 --> 03:45.773
All right, fellas.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.643
Yeah, let's have
a party here, huh? ALL:

03:48.644 --> 03:51.111
Finally, you're gonna see
why Sammy's so famous.

03:51.112 --> 03:53.264
Actually, uh,
we don't get the channel

03:53.299 --> 03:55.266
that shows why Sammy's
so famous.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.550
(all laughing)

03:56.585 --> 03:59.486
(phone rings)

03:59.521 --> 04:00.988
(groaning)

04:01.023 --> 04:02.957
Cheers.

04:02.991 --> 04:05.159
Oh, hi, Vera.

04:05.194 --> 04:09.030
Uh, no, Vera, I'm sorry,
Norm's not here.

04:09.064 --> 04:10.832
Can I take a...

04:10.866 --> 04:12.800
It's an emergency?

04:13.786 --> 04:15.203
All right, all right.

04:15.204 --> 04:16.805
Whoa, you're not gonna
believe this, Vera,

04:16.805 --> 04:18.016
but Norm just walked in.

04:18.017 --> 04:19.307
(muffled):
Hello, everybody.

04:19.308 --> 04:21.910
ALL:
Norm!

04:21.911 --> 04:23.611
(muffled):
Why, hello, Mr. Peterson.

04:23.612 --> 04:24.879
(mumbling)

04:24.913 --> 04:27.014
(all laughing)

04:28.650 --> 04:29.817
Hi, honey.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.436
What's the problem?

04:31.470 --> 04:34.038
What, an IRS audit?

04:34.072 --> 04:35.756
No, it can't be this afternoon.

04:35.757 --> 04:37.808
They've got to give you
at least three, four notices.

04:37.809 --> 04:39.477
This is the fourth notice?

04:40.446 --> 04:41.896
All right, all...

04:41.897 --> 04:43.031
look, don't worry about it.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.866
Don't... listen,

04:44.867 --> 04:46.467
as long as you're
checking the mail,

04:46.468 --> 04:48.803
uh, could you check
to see if the, uh,

04:48.838 --> 04:51.072
Victoria's Secret catalogue
came in?

04:51.106 --> 04:52.640
It did? Good, good.

04:52.674 --> 04:54.408
Just... just hold onto it, okay?

04:54.442 --> 04:56.944
And for God sakes,
don't order anything.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.701
Hey, Norm, what are you doing?

05:02.702 --> 05:04.602
Just getting prepared.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.104
I'm gonna bury this
auditor in paperwork.

05:07.139 --> 05:08.506
I got phony receipts.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.874
I got a postdated diary.

05:09.908 --> 05:12.210
I got fake mileage
logs, the works.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.095
Why are you meeting
the auditor here?

05:14.096 --> 05:16.864
Old trick, Rebecca: you meet
the enemy on your own turf.

05:16.865 --> 05:20.218
Yeah, well, that's very smart
there, Normie, very smart.

05:20.252 --> 05:22.420
Hey, let me give you
another hint.

05:22.454 --> 05:24.939
Keep the authority figure
on your own eye level.

05:24.940 --> 05:26.707
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, it intimidates them.

05:26.708 --> 05:27.958
Really?
Oh, yeah, sure.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.727
You know, whenever
I get stopped by a policeman,

05:29.728 --> 05:32.162
I get out of the car
and face him eye to eye.

05:32.163 --> 05:33.698
Hey, you know,
that's good thinking, Clavin.

05:33.699 --> 05:35.867
And you know,
another good thing to do

05:35.901 --> 05:38.836
is reach into your vest pocket
real sudden like.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.438
Give the cop a good start.

05:40.439 --> 05:41.906
That way, he won't
push you around.

05:41.907 --> 05:44.909
Ah, well, thank you
very much, Carla.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.413
Just planting the seed.

05:48.447 --> 05:49.980
Take a look at all this stuff.

05:49.981 --> 05:51.649
Just take a look
at all this stuff.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.584
When she sees this,
she's gonna crumble.

05:53.585 --> 05:54.786
Did you say "she"?

05:54.820 --> 05:55.887
Yeah.

05:55.921 --> 05:57.488
What are you worried about?

05:57.523 --> 05:58.573
What do you mean?

05:58.590 --> 06:00.825
All you got to do is flirt
with her a little.

06:00.859 --> 06:01.909
(chuckling)

06:01.927 --> 06:03.494
Right, flirt- me?

06:03.529 --> 06:04.762
Yeah.
Come on.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.932
I haven't flirted with a
woman since I met Vera.

06:07.966 --> 06:12.236
Actually, I think she killed
the part of me that flirts.

06:12.270 --> 06:14.505
Come on, I mean, you can do it.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.541
You compliment her a little.

06:16.575 --> 06:17.842
You sweet-talk her.

06:17.843 --> 06:20.077
Before you know it,
she's putty in your hands.

06:20.078 --> 06:21.245
Yeah, right.

06:21.279 --> 06:23.247
Would you flirt
with an IRS agent?

06:23.281 --> 06:25.249
I do it with the tollbooth guy.

06:31.624 --> 06:34.225
I'm looking for Norm Peterson.

06:35.694 --> 06:37.111
And you are?

06:37.146 --> 06:38.963
Dot Carroll, IRS.

06:38.964 --> 06:39.964
Oh.

06:39.965 --> 06:42.266
He's right over
there on the corner.

06:42.301 --> 06:43.768
Ouch.

06:44.687 --> 06:46.204
NORM:
Ah, Ms. Carroll,

06:46.205 --> 06:47.689
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

06:47.690 --> 06:49.623
After all, I'm an
accountant myself.

06:49.658 --> 06:52.343
And I should be interested
in that because...?

06:52.377 --> 06:53.528
No reason.

06:53.562 --> 06:54.895
No reason at all.

06:54.896 --> 06:57.081
Is there someplace we can talk?

06:57.082 --> 06:58.716
Yes, uh, the
office there, uh...

06:58.717 --> 07:00.785
I think you'll find that
everything's in perfect order.

07:00.786 --> 07:01.969
It better be.

07:01.970 --> 07:03.871
I just spent two hours
with some horse's ass

07:03.872 --> 07:06.340
who tried to play the old
fake receipts and diary on me.

07:06.341 --> 07:07.508
Can you believe it?

07:10.312 --> 07:11.512
Ouch.

07:12.847 --> 07:15.566
Okay, fellas,
bring it on in here.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.834
Put it over there

07:16.835 --> 07:18.202
under the other
television, all right?

07:18.203 --> 07:19.937
And plug it in for me.

07:19.938 --> 07:21.289
What's with the big screen?

07:21.290 --> 07:22.723
Oh, some channel is playing

07:22.724 --> 07:24.125
one of Sam's baseball
triumphs tonight.

07:24.126 --> 07:25.266
Here, see for yourself.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.778
Uh-huh.

07:27.813 --> 07:28.980
(Carla clears throat)

07:29.014 --> 07:31.182
Sammy, can I talk
to you for a minute?

07:31.217 --> 07:32.450
You betcha.

07:32.484 --> 07:34.886
You know, about this game
that's on tonight...

07:34.920 --> 07:37.121
Uh-huh.
Do you remember what happened?

07:37.156 --> 07:38.689
Yeah, I won.
(chuckles)

07:38.724 --> 07:41.226
Hey, Sam, this was in
your drinking days.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.194
I mean, this is the
game where you thought

07:43.195 --> 07:46.497
the Orioles' mascot was
a huge mutant bird.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.484
Oh, my God.

07:50.518 --> 07:52.203
Yeah, remember?
Oh...

07:52.237 --> 07:54.054
Yeah, you threw a
fastball at him.

07:54.055 --> 07:55.556
You hit him right
between the eyes

07:55.557 --> 07:56.924
and gave him a concussion.

07:56.958 --> 07:58.243
Well, what would you do

07:58.244 --> 08:00.378
if you saw this gigantic bird
coming at you?

08:00.379 --> 08:01.812
Would you just
let it attack you

08:01.813 --> 08:03.247
and peck your eyes out?

08:03.281 --> 08:06.300
Come on, it took you three
years to live it down.

08:06.301 --> 08:07.769
I mean, you really
want these guys

08:07.770 --> 08:09.170
seeing it all over again?

08:09.204 --> 08:11.389
Shh... shh...

08:11.390 --> 08:13.157
Sammy, all set
for the big game tonight, huh?

08:13.158 --> 08:14.492
STEVE:
Hey, all right.

08:14.493 --> 08:15.543
A big screen TV.

08:15.544 --> 08:17.594
Hey, Sammy, we ordered
a bunch of pizzas.

08:17.612 --> 08:19.880
Say, uh, fellas, hey, listen,

08:19.881 --> 08:21.215
you-you-you don't
want to watch

08:21.216 --> 08:22.450
that silly old game, do you?

08:22.451 --> 08:24.285
Let's see what else
is on at 8:30.

08:24.286 --> 08:25.786
Hey, here you go, look at this.

08:25.787 --> 08:28.222
Magilla Gorilla, huh?

08:28.257 --> 08:30.391
ALL:
Come on!

08:30.425 --> 08:33.010
$500 to have your
nails wrapped?

08:33.044 --> 08:34.278
Yeah.

08:34.313 --> 08:37.515
Yeah, I have
a very low calcium count.

08:37.515 --> 08:39.000
According to these receipts,

08:39.001 --> 08:41.835
you had a lot of business
dinners with a C. Clavin.

08:41.870 --> 08:44.839
Yeah, he's a, um,
very important business client.

08:44.873 --> 08:47.241
I constantly have
to wine and dine the guy.

08:47.275 --> 08:49.985
Well, I certainly hope
he enjoyed his three Whoppers.

08:51.146 --> 08:53.013
I believe he did, yes.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.517
Mr. Peterson, about
this work diary

08:56.551 --> 08:58.719
from 1989...
Yeah.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.605
I'd be willing to bet
that if I took this

09:00.606 --> 09:02.473
to my office for an analysis,
they would discover

09:02.474 --> 09:04.943
that the ink is not more
than 30 minutes old.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.478
So what, you're
gonna try to penalize me

09:07.512 --> 09:10.448
for copying it over
for neatness?

09:12.451 --> 09:14.652
Mr. Peterson...
Yeah?

09:14.653 --> 09:17.204
As an accountant, I'm sure
you're aware that the penalty

09:17.205 --> 09:19.824
for defrauding the United States
government is imprisonment.

09:19.825 --> 09:23.277
This conversation
just took a left turn.

09:23.311 --> 09:26.196
Fake receipts, phony diary.

09:26.231 --> 09:29.500
Mr. Peterson,
you are in very big trouble.

09:29.501 --> 09:31.035
I can't believe I'm hearing this

09:31.036 --> 09:32.953
from someone... as...

09:37.226 --> 09:39.677
doggone it, as...

09:39.712 --> 09:42.847
as, uh, as lovely as yourself.

09:42.881 --> 09:46.133
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

09:46.168 --> 09:49.820
Come on, just...
take a look at you.

09:49.855 --> 09:52.657
You've got the...
sculpted cheekbones,

09:52.691 --> 09:55.059
those smouldering eyes,

09:55.093 --> 09:57.061
a voice any man
could get lost in.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.012
You're not giving yourself

09:59.013 --> 10:00.181
enough credit, Miss Carroll.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.949
I mean, surely
I'm not the first man

10:01.950 --> 10:03.517
who's ever said
these things to you.

10:03.518 --> 10:06.437
I think I know what's
going on here, Mr. Peterson.

10:06.472 --> 10:07.705
What?

10:07.739 --> 10:09.690
I wasn't born yesterday.

10:09.724 --> 10:12.426
I know when someone's
making a pass at me.

10:12.461 --> 10:14.495
And let me
tell you this, buster,

10:14.496 --> 10:16.063
you're coming on to an official

10:16.064 --> 10:17.565
of the United
States government,

10:17.566 --> 10:20.867
an auditor for
the Internal Revenue Service.

10:21.820 --> 10:24.338
This meeting is over...

10:24.372 --> 10:26.691
stud!

10:26.692 --> 10:29.776
We'll continue this audit
in my hotel room.

10:29.777 --> 10:31.345
Ritz Carlton, room 147.

10:31.379 --> 10:32.980
Meet me there tonight.

10:35.283 --> 10:37.251
And P.S.,

10:37.285 --> 10:39.220
I play rough.

10:50.198 --> 10:52.183
I tell you, as far
as I'm concerned,

10:52.217 --> 10:55.053
you got it made in the shade
with this IRS chick.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.889
Hey, not only do you
get out of jail free,

10:57.923 --> 11:01.726
but, uh, you get
a little action on the side.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.495
High five!

11:06.381 --> 11:08.182
Nobody. Okay.

11:10.752 --> 11:13.453
NORM:
Well, Miss Ann Landers,

11:13.454 --> 11:14.522
are you happy?

11:14.523 --> 11:16.624
I took your advice-
I flirted with the woman.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.192
Now she wants to sleep with me.

11:18.226 --> 11:19.527
What do you suggest now?

11:19.561 --> 11:22.212
I suggest you keep
the lights off.

11:22.247 --> 11:24.398
Thank you.

11:24.432 --> 11:27.001
Well, I say,
sauce for the goose.

11:27.035 --> 11:29.603
At last a male
is being sexually harassed.

11:29.637 --> 11:31.672
Let this be a lesson to us.

11:31.706 --> 11:35.509
I mean, how many of us have,
in our lives, in some small way,

11:35.543 --> 11:38.979
depersonalised a member
of the opposite sex?

11:40.866 --> 11:44.568
Whoa, mangos-
two for a buck!

11:44.569 --> 11:47.154
You see?
That's exactly the kind

11:47.155 --> 11:49.205
of boorish behaviour
I'm talking about!

11:49.224 --> 11:51.925
Hey, Sam,
how's it going back there?

11:51.959 --> 11:53.060
Uh, fine.

11:53.094 --> 11:55.862
All I got to do is
undo these two wires,

11:55.863 --> 11:57.731
and the fellows will
never see the game.

11:57.732 --> 11:59.567
(electrical crackling)

12:01.587 --> 12:04.038
(grunts)

12:06.575 --> 12:09.577
Sam, are you okay?

12:09.611 --> 12:11.612
I just remembered.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.581
I fought in the Civil War.

12:13.728 --> 12:17.618
Hey, you know, I think
you busted the TV.

12:17.619 --> 12:18.786
Wow!

12:18.820 --> 12:20.438
What happened?

12:20.472 --> 12:22.423
Oh! Yeah, uh, I'm
sorry, fellas.

12:22.424 --> 12:24.825
I was, uh, I was, you know,
trying to make the colour

12:24.826 --> 12:26.594
just right on the TV
for the big game,

12:26.595 --> 12:27.695
and, uh, something blew.

12:27.696 --> 12:28.496
Ah, Sammy.
(men grumbling)

12:28.497 --> 12:30.514
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, guys.

12:30.515 --> 12:31.682
But, hey, don't worry about it.

12:31.683 --> 12:32.816
They're-They're bound
to show it again.

12:32.817 --> 12:33.985
It was a hell of a game.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.419
I was pretty good
in it, too, fellas.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.487
Don't worry, Sammy.

12:36.488 --> 12:37.721
We'll watch it on
the regular TV.

12:37.722 --> 12:38.922
(cheering)
No, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:38.923 --> 12:40.424
Tim, actually, put that down,
put that down.

12:40.425 --> 12:42.042
Uh, forgot to tell you, fellas,

12:42.043 --> 12:44.178
that, uh, I was working
on that TV earlier,

12:44.179 --> 12:46.180
trying to get the colour
just right for the game,

12:46.181 --> 12:48.916
and, uh, damnedest thing,
it-it blew.

12:48.950 --> 12:51.519
It blew as well as
the big screen there.

12:51.553 --> 12:54.855
Uh, I guess we're just not meant
to see this game, huh, fellas?

12:54.889 --> 12:56.790
It's okay, Sammy.

12:56.824 --> 12:58.959
We can, uh, see it
on my little Watchman.

12:59.166 --> 13:02.863
Where did that thing
come from, Paul?

13:02.864 --> 13:04.498
I take it with me everywhere.

13:04.499 --> 13:06.199
You know, you can, uh,
run it on batteries,

13:06.200 --> 13:08.569
or I plug it in the, uh,
cigarette lighter in my car.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.370
Paul, you watch TV in the car?

13:10.405 --> 13:12.773
I don't like to miss my stories.

13:14.659 --> 13:16.894
Can I see that?

13:16.928 --> 13:18.129
Oh!

13:18.163 --> 13:19.493
(chuckles):
Look at that.

13:19.494 --> 13:20.764
I'll be damned.
That's a beauty.

13:20.765 --> 13:21.765
I guess you just...

13:21.766 --> 13:23.934
Oh.

13:23.968 --> 13:25.185
Hey.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.820
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

13:26.854 --> 13:29.573
Uh, Paul, I'll-I'll replace it.

13:29.607 --> 13:31.075
It's $300.

13:31.109 --> 13:33.327
No, I meant the beer, Paul.

13:33.328 --> 13:34.995
Sam, Sam, your
behaviour leads me

13:34.996 --> 13:36.396
to one of two conclusions:

13:36.397 --> 13:38.332
A) You're trying to keep
us from seeing that game;

13:38.333 --> 13:41.368
Or B) You've just suffered a
small cerebrovascular accident.

13:41.369 --> 13:43.821
What the hell is
going on here, Sam?

13:43.856 --> 13:45.522
All right, I'll...

13:45.523 --> 13:46.590
I'm sorry, fellas.

13:46.591 --> 13:47.691
It's just...

13:47.726 --> 13:49.443
I don't want you
to see the game.

13:49.477 --> 13:51.161
I made a real idiot
out of myself.

13:51.162 --> 13:53.597
I was, I was drunk that night
when I was pitching,

13:53.598 --> 13:56.066
and, well, I kind of got mad

13:56.101 --> 13:59.036
at the Oriole mascot and...

13:59.070 --> 14:01.171
well, I skulled him.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.474
Sammy, now, are-are you
talking about

14:03.508 --> 14:05.642
that-that big stupid bird

14:05.643 --> 14:07.778
that used to dance around
on top of the dugout?

14:07.779 --> 14:09.696
A-Actually, Alan,
it turns out

14:09.731 --> 14:12.233
that's a man
in a bird's costume.

14:14.469 --> 14:16.837
See, I just, uh...

14:16.838 --> 14:18.806
well, I-I'm real
embarrassed about it,

14:18.807 --> 14:21.475
and it'd mean a lot to me if
you guys didn't watch the game.

14:21.476 --> 14:24.177
I-I-I don't want to be
remembered like that.

14:24.212 --> 14:25.680
We understand, Sam.

14:25.681 --> 14:28.015
Yeah, Sammy, all you had to do
was say something.

14:28.016 --> 14:29.483
It's okay, Sam, really.

14:29.517 --> 14:31.601
Ah, hey, thanks a lot, guys.

14:31.602 --> 14:32.836
That-That means a lot to me.

14:32.837 --> 14:34.104
Thank you.

14:34.105 --> 14:36.440
Uh, Carla, give these guys
a drink on the house.

14:36.441 --> 14:37.708
Thanks a lot, fellas.

14:37.709 --> 14:38.775
(chuckling, chattering)
Thanks, Sammy!

14:38.776 --> 14:40.311
Thanks a lot.
That's great.

14:40.345 --> 14:41.945
Looky here.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.614
Hey, Paul, you got
two of those?

14:43.615 --> 14:44.948
Yeah, I always keep one charged.

14:44.949 --> 14:47.885
(chuckling,
ball game playing over TV)

14:51.089 --> 14:53.057
(dryer blowing air)

14:55.977 --> 14:57.244
(dryer stops)

14:57.278 --> 14:59.268
So, Norm, decide what
you're gonna do?

14:59.280 --> 15:01.048
I know one thing's for sure.

15:01.049 --> 15:02.516
I can't just sleep
with some woman

15:02.517 --> 15:04.318
so she'll go easier
on my tax audit.

15:04.352 --> 15:05.852
You know, uh, Norm,

15:05.853 --> 15:08.689
I've known you for a long time,
and I consider you a friend.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.923
Yeah.

15:09.958 --> 15:13.293
And I, uh, just want you to know
that I got connections.

15:13.294 --> 15:15.329
Might be able to make it
a little easier for you.

15:15.330 --> 15:16.697
You mean people in the IRS?

15:16.698 --> 15:18.048
No, prison.

15:18.082 --> 15:20.484
Right.

15:20.518 --> 15:21.819
Thanks a lot.

15:21.853 --> 15:24.121
Of course, if I tell this woman

15:24.155 --> 15:26.490
that I'm not really
that attracted to her,

15:26.524 --> 15:28.926
she'll get so angry, I
will wind up in prison.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.794
Well, relax, Norm.

15:30.795 --> 15:32.663
I've been brainstorming,
and I've come up with a plan.

15:32.664 --> 15:33.797
Yeah?
Yeah.

15:33.798 --> 15:35.165
I'm desperate;
I'll try anything.

15:35.166 --> 15:36.433
Come on.

15:36.434 --> 15:37.785
All right, tell you what,
here's the plan.

15:37.786 --> 15:39.553
Uh-huh.
I go to the hotel in your place, right?

15:39.554 --> 15:40.988
I reach in,
flick off the lights,

15:40.989 --> 15:42.389
say "Room service
for Dot Carroll."

15:42.390 --> 15:46.259
In the meantime, I've got
a big bag full of wild squirrels

15:46.294 --> 15:49.362
with sparklers
attached to their tails.

15:49.397 --> 15:50.731
I drop them in the room.

15:50.732 --> 15:51.998
They run around terrified,

15:51.999 --> 15:53.534
setting off the alarms
and the sprinklers.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.636
Okay? In the ensuing hubbub,

15:55.637 --> 15:57.871
she forgets all about
her little date with you.

15:57.872 --> 15:58.922
Trust me.

15:58.923 --> 16:00.941
You think a cold shower's
a mood killer?

16:00.942 --> 16:03.176
Try a bag of wild squirrels.

16:03.177 --> 16:07.764
Thanks, Cliff, but, uh, you
don't have to go to the trouble.

16:07.765 --> 16:11.168
That's all right;
I already got the squirrels.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.136
Thank you, but no.

16:13.171 --> 16:15.272
Okay, okay.

16:16.541 --> 16:17.991
Hey, Norm, I got an idea.

16:18.026 --> 16:19.192
What?

16:19.193 --> 16:21.261
Why don't I just pick up
the phone and call Vera

16:21.262 --> 16:22.396
and tell her what's going on?

16:22.397 --> 16:23.714
Now, listen.

16:23.715 --> 16:25.282
She'll run over
to the Ritz Carlton

16:25.283 --> 16:27.718
and burst into the room
before anything can happen.

16:27.719 --> 16:30.954
This way, Dot can't get angry at
you, and you'll be off the hook.

16:30.955 --> 16:31.905
Yeah, yeah.

16:31.906 --> 16:33.840
Then Dot tells Vera
how I came on to her.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.645
Either way, I spend the next
ten years sleeping on a cot.

16:38.146 --> 16:41.748
Well, Norm, you could get,
uh, someone to impersonate Vera.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.500
Well, thanks, Fras, but I doubt

16:43.535 --> 16:46.886
that Ed Asner has time to
hop on a plane to Boston.

16:46.921 --> 16:50.090
Well, I was thinking more

16:50.124 --> 16:52.993
along the lines of,
uh, a friend in the bar.

16:54.763 --> 16:55.895
(scoffs):
Oh.

16:55.930 --> 16:57.364
NORM:
Come on, Carla.

16:57.365 --> 16:58.849
This was your idea
in the first place. Oh, no.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.584
What do you say you
help me out? Come on.

17:00.585 --> 17:01.969
Oh, and why should I?

17:02.003 --> 17:04.771
You haven't left me a tip
in 15 years.

17:04.806 --> 17:08.008
Frankly, I never felt
the service was all that great.

17:08.009 --> 17:11.845
Come on, are you gonna
help me or aren't you?

17:11.846 --> 17:13.480
Forget about it!

17:13.515 --> 17:15.281
All right, fine.

17:15.316 --> 17:17.083
Fine. I'm
on my own.

17:17.117 --> 17:21.555
I'll just go over to the hotel
and throw myself at her mercy.

17:21.589 --> 17:23.490
I'll plead with the woman.

17:23.525 --> 17:25.559
I'll beg her.

17:25.593 --> 17:28.546
I'll say how wrong it is
for her to force me to do this.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.110
What the hell, it worked for me
on my wedding night.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.598
I'll make this short and sweet.

18:04.599 --> 18:06.600
When I say "go,"
you tear off my clothes,

18:06.601 --> 18:08.235
and you can't use your hands.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.423
Well, hell, come on in.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.415
Enough foreplay.

18:21.449 --> 18:22.616
Let's be sheet meat.

18:22.650 --> 18:25.369
Did I tell you
that I was married?

18:25.403 --> 18:26.853
(scoffs) Congratulations.

18:26.871 --> 18:29.072
Let's celebrate
with a roll in the hay.

18:29.106 --> 18:31.458
Listen, there were
some things I said to you

18:31.492 --> 18:33.761
this afternoon
that I-I really...

18:33.795 --> 18:34.895
Don't worry.

18:34.930 --> 18:36.446
I'll be gentle.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.115
Drop trou on three.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.366
One, two...
(knocking on door)

18:39.367 --> 18:40.567
Who the hell's that?

18:40.568 --> 18:42.102
I'll get it,
I'll get it, I'll get it.

18:42.103 --> 18:43.904
CARLA:
It's me, Vera, your wife!

18:43.905 --> 18:45.405
What are you doing
in there, Norm?!

18:45.406 --> 18:47.808
You better not have
a woman in there!

18:47.842 --> 18:49.293
NORM:
Honey, honey.

18:52.029 --> 18:53.397
(gasps)

18:53.431 --> 18:55.131
Vera, now, now, now, calm down.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.633
Calm down, honey, calm down.

18:56.634 --> 18:57.668
Dot, I am so sorry.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.069
How could you?!

18:59.103 --> 19:00.771
I couldn't help myself.

19:00.805 --> 19:02.606
How could you?

19:02.607 --> 19:04.642
Let me put your mind at rest,
Mrs. Peterson.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.943
Nothing happened.

19:05.977 --> 19:07.444
Oh, thank God.

19:07.478 --> 19:08.679
Well, I guess that's it.

19:08.680 --> 19:09.747
We'd better go.
Yeah.

19:09.748 --> 19:10.915
Hey!

19:10.949 --> 19:13.116
Aren't you a waitress
at that bar?

19:13.150 --> 19:14.385
What?

19:14.386 --> 19:15.586
I don't believe for a second

19:15.587 --> 19:17.153
that you two are man and wife.

19:17.154 --> 19:18.689
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.457
I'm Vera Peterson, Norm's wife.

19:20.491 --> 19:22.993
Okay, if you two
are so happily married,

19:23.028 --> 19:26.430
let's see a big,
open-mouthed, sloppy kiss.

19:26.464 --> 19:29.165
Right now.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.038
We don't have to do that.

19:35.073 --> 19:36.240
That's right.

19:36.274 --> 19:39.076
That's for the privacy
of our boudoir.

19:39.110 --> 19:41.895
If I don't see some evidence
of your happy marriage,

19:41.929 --> 19:44.965
I'm gonna go through your
receipts with a fine-tooth comb.

19:48.553 --> 19:50.487
Honey?

20:19.116 --> 20:21.368
I'm sorry, Norm.
You're gonna fry.

20:25.723 --> 20:28.024
Okay, Peterson, what's going on?

20:28.059 --> 20:30.694
All right, Dot.

20:30.728 --> 20:33.163
All right, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

20:33.198 --> 20:35.132
That wasn't my wife.

20:35.166 --> 20:38.735
My wife is probably home in bed.

20:38.769 --> 20:41.838
The truth is, Dot,
I'm not a very good husband.

20:41.872 --> 20:43.240
(sighs)

20:43.274 --> 20:45.375
I hardly spend
any time at all with Vera.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.210
We never talk.

20:47.244 --> 20:49.380
I don't know her birthday.

20:49.381 --> 20:50.847
I don't know
when our anniversary is.

20:50.848 --> 20:53.133
But I don't cheat on her.

20:53.134 --> 20:55.085
Now, that may not
sound like much to you,

20:55.086 --> 20:56.987
but to me,
it's the difference between

20:56.988 --> 20:59.923
being a bad husband
and being a bad person.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.762
So, go ahead, d-do your worst.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.497
Throw the book at me.

21:06.531 --> 21:09.149
I should've known.

21:09.183 --> 21:10.650
I scared you away, didn't I?

21:12.120 --> 21:14.237
I'm always scaring men away.

21:14.271 --> 21:16.607
What is it about me?!

21:17.959 --> 21:20.093
Don't just stand there, tell me!
Uh...

21:22.063 --> 21:24.331
(sighs)
You could lighten up a bit.

21:24.365 --> 21:27.101
I mean, you do
come on sort of strong.

21:27.135 --> 21:28.368
And while we're at it,

21:28.403 --> 21:31.405
you could cut back
to three or four packs a day.

21:31.439 --> 21:33.957
I do it to stay thin.

21:33.991 --> 21:35.459
Want one?

21:38.963 --> 21:41.665
All right,
this isn't about me, okay?

21:43.287 --> 21:47.103
Oh, I guess I'm just
not used to somebody

21:47.104 --> 21:49.439
saying nice things to me.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.208
Well, I could start right now.

21:51.242 --> 21:52.509
All right?

21:52.544 --> 21:54.294
(sighs)

21:54.329 --> 21:57.230
I believe that underneath
that gruff exterior,

21:57.231 --> 21:59.433
you're probably a very
nice, warm, caring person.

21:59.434 --> 22:01.268
Okay? And I say
that knowing that

22:01.269 --> 22:02.902
you're probably gonna
throw me in jail.

22:02.903 --> 22:03.887
(scoffs)

22:03.888 --> 22:05.458
You're not going to jail, Norm.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.158
I wouldn't throw a decent man
like you in jail.

22:08.192 --> 22:10.043
Thank you, Dot.

22:13.748 --> 22:17.350
Better head back
to, uh, Cheers.

22:17.384 --> 22:20.136
Um, you want to stay here
and talk a while?

22:20.171 --> 22:22.556
I probably shouldn't.

22:22.590 --> 22:23.873
Got a minibar.

22:23.908 --> 22:25.168
Well, if you need a friend.

22:28.463 --> 22:32.849
That'd be nice,
just you and me, talking.

22:34.286 --> 22:39.672
Room service for Dot Carroll.
