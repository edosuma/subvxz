Excuse me, a master thief.

We're back on the hunt
after the Vatican

by a mysterious group

He's looking for
an ancient Mongolian artifact

called the Spirit Banner.DANNY: Also known
as the Soul of Genghis Khan.

And they're leaving
a path of destruction

00:54.663 --> 00:55.794
You know where it is now?

00:55.838 --> 00:57.187
I did some searching
on behalf

00:57.231 --> 00:59.015
of a rather well-heeled
former client.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.844
DANNY: Take us to the secret
Soviet base in Mongolia.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.019
We'll find the Spirit Banner.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.629
We'll catch the Great Khan.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.414
Spirit Banners
were made out of the hair

They clipped some of the
hair from the Banner.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.684
This is like
a genuine prison break.[distant shouting]

01:15.727 --> 01:16.859
I want to put you to work.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.121
The Soul of Genghis Khan?

01:18.165 --> 01:19.209
Can I assume that that's
what you want me

01:19.253 --> 01:20.471
to find?

01:20.515 --> 01:22.169
The man who hired me to search

01:22.212 --> 01:24.432
for your Banner a while back
is a rich financier.

Ooh.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.285
BOTH: What?SHAW:
I just think that collectively,

01:51.328 --> 01:53.113
maybe we've smelled better.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.201
We were in Mongolia.

They don't have soap
in Mongolia?

Oh, God. This...

There's a muskiness.DANNY:
The only way out

Yeah, we do.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.651
Why didn't you call me?

02:09.694 --> 02:11.392
Shaw would've came
to the rescue.

Our phones were
dead. Speaking of,

they were off to Rome

a joint CIA/Vatican operation

02:24.622 --> 02:28.148

involving the Spirit Banner.SHAW: Yeah, well,

02:28.191 --> 02:29.453
she may be on your side.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.412
That don't mean
I got to like her.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.414
Okay, I'm gonna go

02:33.457 --> 02:36.330
wash Mongolia off of me.

02:44.425 --> 02:47.297
You find something out there?DANNY:Yeah.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.081
A scientist named Dr. Orlov

02:49.125 --> 02:50.953
was the last known person to
have the Banner, but his trail

02:50.996 --> 02:54.304
went cold, so it's a dead end
for us and the Khan.

02:54.348 --> 02:57.002
I didn't mean that.
I meant you two.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.526
Yeah, you seem different.

02:58.569 --> 02:59.875
I-In a good way.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.006
Yeah, we're good.

03:02.312 --> 03:03.444
We're great, actually.

03:03.487 --> 03:04.706
Come this way.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.362
I've been working
on this P.I. case with Vince.

03:08.405 --> 03:09.885
A jewelry store burned down.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.017
Insurance company
thought the owner did it himself

03:12.061 --> 03:15.325
for the payout.
Well, Vince found out he did.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.849
Owner fled,
left behind some inventory.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.982
DANNY:
Shaw, I thought
you were going legit.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.723
I am.
But just because you're in AA

03:21.766 --> 03:23.377
don't mean
you can't have one beer.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.248
That's exactly what it means.Man,

03:25.292 --> 03:26.902
I'm doing this for you.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.426
I had a hunch that maybe
you wanted to do some shopping

03:29.470 --> 03:31.254
on the DL.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.951
For engagement rings?Shh!

03:32.995 --> 03:35.519
What part of "DL"
do you not get?

03:35.563 --> 03:37.565
I'm only having
this conversation

03:37.608 --> 03:40.132
because I think
this convergence is a sign.

03:40.176 --> 03:43.353
You think God made a jeweler
burn down his own store

03:43.397 --> 03:44.833
for the insurance money

03:44.876 --> 03:46.922
to get me to
propose to Lexi?

03:46.965 --> 03:48.402
Yeah.Look,

03:48.445 --> 03:49.751
I'm not saying
I haven't thought about it.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.840
And I'm not trying
to pressure you.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.581
It's a process.

03:53.624 --> 03:56.148
Let's just get a sense
of the ballpark

03:56.192 --> 03:57.933
we're looking at.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.804
For instance,

03:59.848 --> 04:02.154
take this rare beauty.

04:02.198 --> 04:04.940
Shaw, that's ivory.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.333
Danny, ivory is illegal.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.944
What kind of monster
do you think I am?

04:08.987 --> 04:10.772
This...

04:10.815 --> 04:12.904
This here is human bone.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.908
Ancienthuman bone.

04:16.952 --> 04:21.217
Handcrafted near
the Pura Tirta Empulin Bali.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.482
It's all good, man.
We're calibrating.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.745
Lapis lazuli.

04:27.789 --> 04:30.095
It's the prized stone
of ancient Egypt.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.750
I can get Vince to talk
to the insurance company.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.884
Maybe get you a deal.
All on the up-and-up.

Oh, no.

another button pusher

09:45.933 --> 09:48.152

in selling it.

he was meeting with Simon

He's some big muckety-muck

with him, he must know

10:56.656 --> 10:58.005
