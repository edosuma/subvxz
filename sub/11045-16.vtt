WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:06.174
I hope Shining Armor
and Princess Cadance

00:06.207 --> 00:07.641
don't think it's too
soon for me

00:07.675 --> 00:10.111
to come back to the Crystal
Empire for a visit.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.380
But I just know Flurry Heart's
grown so much already.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.815
I wonder if I'll
even recognize her.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.185
She's the only baby
they have, Twilight.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.154
I think it'll be pretty easy
to figure out who she is.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.789
Mm.

00:21.822 --> 00:25.093
Sorry, I know you want to visit
your niece as much as possible

00:25.126 --> 00:27.261
and I'm excited to
see Sunburst again.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.696
I just don't want
to fall behind

00:28.729 --> 00:31.099
on my friendship
lessons back home.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.302
Starlight, your work in
Ponyville isn't going anywhere.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.604
Besides, I think we
all know you can learn

00:36.637 --> 00:38.606
about friendship
anywhere, right Spike?

00:40.308 --> 00:43.144
Spike? Who's Spike?

00:43.177 --> 00:46.614
[Pfft] Uh you're
Spike, Spike.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.150
And why are you
dressed like that?

00:49.183 --> 00:51.452
Guys! You're blowing my cover.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.754
How'd you even
know it was me?

00:53.787 --> 00:58.226
Because you're YOU-- in
a coat, hat, and glasses.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.560
Also, we're the
only ones here.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.496
Right.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.099
Spike, why do you
need a disguise?

01:05.133 --> 01:07.101
The last time we came
to the Crystal Empire.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.170
there was a lot going
on with the new baby

01:09.203 --> 01:10.070
and the Crystalling,

01:10.104 --> 01:12.140
but I still got
mobbed in the street.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.343
I wouldn't say "mobbed."

01:15.376 --> 01:17.578
And this is just
a family visit.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.813
I wouldn't want the presence of
"Spike the Brave and Glorious"

01:19.847 --> 01:22.250
to turn it into
some kind of circus.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.519
We get it. The Crystal
Ponies adore you.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.656
He did save the
Empire. Twice.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.724
But still, I don't
think your presence

01:30.758 --> 01:32.893
will turn our visit
into a circus.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.563
Not if I find the right
disguise, it won't.

01:42.336 --> 01:45.806
* My little Pony
* My little Pony

01:45.839 --> 01:47.741
* Aaaahhh

01:47.775 --> 01:49.810
* My little Pony

01:49.843 --> 01:52.380
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:52.413 --> 01:54.282
* My Little Pony

01:54.315 --> 01:56.717
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:56.750 --> 01:58.752
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:58.786 --> 02:00.888
* A beautiful heart!
* Faithful and strong!

02:00.921 --> 02:03.257
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

02:03.291 --> 02:05.259
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

02:05.293 --> 02:07.361
* To have my little pony

02:07.395 --> 02:10.698
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

02:10.731 --> 02:11.665
**

02:19.773 --> 02:23.244
Uh disguise or not, Spike, I
don't think you need to worry

02:23.277 --> 02:26.780
about being mobbed.
Nopony's here.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.649
[bird screech]

02:28.682 --> 02:30.618
Spike: It's like a ghost town.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.387
Twilight: I've got a bad
feeling about this.

02:33.421 --> 02:38.926
* [eerie music]

02:38.959 --> 02:42.396
Yeah, this is weird.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.732
I guess I don't need
the disguise after all.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.601
[cheering]

02:47.635 --> 02:50.204
It's Spike, the
Brave and Glorious!

02:50.238 --> 02:52.606
He's come to save
us yet again!

02:52.640 --> 02:55.376
[cheering] Spike! Spike! Spike!

02:55.409 --> 02:56.944
Save you from what?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.712
Yeah. What's going on?

02:58.746 --> 03:01.549
Why was everypony hiding?

03:01.582 --> 03:04.852
It sure looks like Princess
Twilight and her pupil.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.288
But how can we be sure?

03:07.321 --> 03:10.658
We can't. Either one of them
could be the-- you know.

03:13.827 --> 03:18.832
[gasp] What if this isn't
[gasp] the real Spike!?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.501
EVERYPONY RUN!

03:21.935 --> 03:22.870
Awww!

03:24.472 --> 03:27.841
OK. Something strange
is definitely going on.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.877
Ugh, you think?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.583
Who goes there?

03:35.616 --> 03:39.420
Um... you don't recognize
the Princess of Friendship?

03:39.453 --> 03:41.289
Of course we recognize her.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.592
But that doesn't
mean it's really her.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.928
It's OK, guys.
They're with me.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.963
And any friend of Spike
the Brave and Glorious

03:49.997 --> 03:52.600
is a friend of the Crystal
Empire, am I right?

03:54.568 --> 03:57.605
Huh. It does look like him.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.707
Well, it would, wouldn't it?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.843
I'm sorry, but we'll need to see
some proof of identification.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.946
We'll take care of
things from here.

04:05.979 --> 04:10.751
Oh Cadance, thank
goodness! What's going on?

04:10.784 --> 04:14.588
We can explain, Twilly
if it really is you.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.493
"Sunshine, Sunshine--"

04:19.527 --> 04:25.433
"--Lady bugs awake! Clap your
hooves and do a little shake!"

04:25.466 --> 04:28.302
It's OK, everypony.
It's her.

04:31.872 --> 04:35.008
Of course it's her.
What's all this about?

04:35.042 --> 04:37.378
A Changeling's been
spotted nearby.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.579
A Changeling!?

04:38.612 --> 04:39.513
That's not good.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.382
No. It's not.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.617
After Queen Chrysalis took
my place at our wedding

04:43.651 --> 04:46.053
and invaded Canterlot
with her army of minions,

04:46.086 --> 04:48.656
we're not taking any chances.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.591
Changelings feed off of love,

04:50.624 --> 04:52.393
and ever since Flurry
Heart's Crystalling,

04:52.426 --> 04:55.896
the Empire is filled with more
love than anywhere in Equestria.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.499
It's possible they've
come for the baby.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.469
That's why we've posted the
extra guards and why we're--

05:01.502 --> 05:03.604
--checking
everypony's identity.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.839
I'm sorry for all of this.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.842
Flurry Heart's really been
looking forward to seeing you.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.512
[gurgle]

05:11.545 --> 05:13.947
Oh! She's gotten so big!

05:13.981 --> 05:17.618
Starlight and I will do whatever
we can to help protect her.

05:17.651 --> 05:22.089
To be honest, having you
here is already a big relief.

05:22.122 --> 05:25.058
[whispering]

05:25.092 --> 05:27.127
The Royal Guards were
wondering if Spike,

05:27.160 --> 05:28.696
the Brave and Glorious,

05:28.729 --> 05:30.931
would like to join in the
search for the Changeling.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.766
Really?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.403
Uh, I don't know if that's
such a good idea, Spike.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.137
It sounds dangerous.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.973
Come on, Twilight. This is
Spike the Brave and Glorious

05:40.007 --> 05:43.777
you're talking to. Have you ever
known me to run from danger?

05:43.811 --> 05:45.579
Ummmm...

05:45.613 --> 05:47.581
He'll be safe with our guards.

05:47.615 --> 05:51.519
Or will your guards
be safe with me?

05:51.552 --> 05:52.486
[sigh]

05:55.155 --> 05:56.824
Spike, the Brave and Glorious.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.492
You've faced the evil
Changelings before.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.027
What can you tell us?

06:00.060 --> 06:05.599
Oh. Um. Well, they are
Changelings, so they can change.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.068
Do you hear that? These monsters
can look like any of us,

06:08.101 --> 06:11.905
so be on guard, guards.
Even more than normal.

06:11.939 --> 06:15.142
And they could be anywhere.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.011
So we should cover as
much ground as possible.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.848
You, search that way!

06:20.881 --> 06:21.882
[whoosh]

06:21.915 --> 06:23.651
And you search that way!

06:23.684 --> 06:24.452
[whoosh]

06:26.687 --> 06:31.492
And I'll just search
here, I guess.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.662
Not many places to hide.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.431
Unless that rock
is a Changeling.

06:37.465 --> 06:40.934
OK, "rock", how do I know
you're really a rock?

06:40.968 --> 06:46.440
Hmm not talking, huh?
Well, you can't fool me.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.608
Whoa!

06:47.641 --> 06:53.847
[screaming]

06:53.881 --> 06:55.015
[grunt]

06:58.686 --> 07:02.122
Whew. [kissing noises]

07:02.155 --> 07:05.759
OK. Maybe it's time Spike
the Brave and Glorious

07:05.793 --> 07:08.796
went back to, ah,
protect those guards.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.230
[surprised yell]

07:10.263 --> 07:12.165
Phew. Just my reflection.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.068
Huh?

07:20.073 --> 07:24.111
Ha hah! Hmm, just my
imagination, I guess.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.212
[thud]

07:29.082 --> 07:30.651
AUGGGGGHHHH!

07:33.554 --> 07:38.759
Ch-ch-ch-changeling!!

07:38.792 --> 07:41.061
No, wait! Come back!

07:41.094 --> 07:42.162
AAAAHHHHHH!

07:43.831 --> 07:46.567
AAAAHHHHHH!

07:48.201 --> 07:49.837
This is unexpected.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.942
The ice is pretty slippery.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.546
I wouldn't want you to
get hurt because of me.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.615
You... saved me?

08:01.649 --> 08:05.753
It's OK. I know you
don't want to be friends.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.621
Wait!

08:07.655 --> 08:12.292
I don't understand. Changelings
are supposed to be evil, right?

08:12.325 --> 08:17.097
Evil? Oh, not me. All I've
ever wanted is a friend.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.701
From the moment I first split
my egg in the nursery hive.

08:20.734 --> 08:25.505
[hissing]

08:32.312 --> 08:35.115
I was part of the
attack on Canterlot

08:35.148 --> 08:36.784
during the Royal Wedding.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.052
But I'd never seen true
friendship like that,

08:39.086 --> 08:42.022
and I couldn't just steal
it and feed on its love.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.557
I wanted to share it!

08:46.026 --> 08:49.797
After that, I knew I couldn't
live with my kind anymore.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.700
I set off looking for
love to share. But--

08:52.733 --> 08:54.201
But what?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.136
I'm starving!

08:56.169 --> 08:59.607
And there's so much love in
the Crystal Empire right now.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.944
It's what drew me here,
but it's driving me crazy!

09:03.977 --> 09:05.946
That would be from
the Royal Crystalling.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.981
It's pretty much a giant
outpouring of light and love

09:08.015 --> 09:09.316
for a new baby.

09:09.349 --> 09:14.254
[hiss] Oh, sorry.
I'm just so hungry.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.858
If I had a friend, maybe the
love we shared could sustain me,

09:17.891 --> 09:21.895
but I don't think the Crystal
Ponies want to be friends.

09:21.929 --> 09:25.766
What if I told you there was
somepony they respect and admire

09:25.799 --> 09:29.302
so much, he could convince
them to give it a try?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.004
If only that were true!

09:31.038 --> 09:35.208
It is! I mean, I
am. It's ME! Spike!

09:37.978 --> 09:42.182
Spike? The Brave and Glorious?
I'm sure you've heard of me.

09:42.215 --> 09:46.153
No, but I was raised by
an evil queen. I'm Thorax.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.822
I can't believe you
want to help me.

09:48.856 --> 09:53.360
Why? Hasn't anypony ever
just been nice to you?

09:53.393 --> 10:00.267
[hiss] Sorry! Sorry! Kindness
like that kind of brings it out.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.402
Do you still want
to be my friend?

10:02.435 --> 10:06.106
Of course! And I am one
hundred percent sure

10:06.139 --> 10:08.676
I can get the whole Crystal
Empire to be your friend too.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.411
[hiss]

10:11.444 --> 10:14.715
But, maybe I should just uh,
talk to them first.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.820
What do you mean? Did
you see the Changeling?

10:19.853 --> 10:21.722
Did you defeat
the evil creature?

10:21.755 --> 10:24.257
Defeating a Changeling
would be brave,

10:24.291 --> 10:26.326
but do you know what
would be glorious?

10:26.359 --> 10:28.261
Defeating two Changelings?

10:28.295 --> 10:31.164
Defeating all the Changelings?

10:31.198 --> 10:33.266
Not having to fight
the Changeling at all

10:33.300 --> 10:35.869
because I made
friends with him.

10:35.903 --> 10:42.342
Ha hah! Oh. Wow. For a second
I thought you were serious!

10:42.375 --> 10:47.180
Ha ha! Could you imagine?
Friends with a Changeling?

10:47.214 --> 10:50.117
I am serious. He
wants to be friends.

10:50.150 --> 10:54.221
Ha ha ha! Right!

10:54.254 --> 10:56.790
Not only are you Spike
the Brave and Glorious,

10:56.824 --> 10:59.927
you're also Spike
the Hilarious! Ha ha!

10:59.960 --> 11:02.429
I'm not joking. The
Changeling is nice.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.800
HA HA HA!

11:06.834 --> 11:09.737
I'm sorry. But I don't
think it's funny.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.372
The Changeling Queen,
Chrysalis, kidnapped Cadance

11:12.405 --> 11:14.041
and cast a spell on me.

11:17.310 --> 11:21.114
There's no such thing
as a nice Changeling.

11:21.148 --> 11:25.853
You're right, Shining Armor.
Sorry. That was a... bad joke.

11:28.822 --> 11:32.092
So? So! What did they say? How
many new friends do I have?

11:32.125 --> 11:36.263
Well... it didn't go
exactly the way I thought.

11:38.832 --> 11:43.203
Uh, I understand. Well,
thanks for trying.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.973
I-I guess it's not surprising.

11:46.006 --> 11:49.409
How can you expect ponies
who look like this.

11:49.442 --> 11:54.314
To trust something
that looks like this?

11:54.347 --> 11:56.884
I think I might know.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.027
Spike, if you're done
searching for the Changeling,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.029
Starlight and I
could use your help.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.398
We're working on a protection
spell for Flurry Heart

12:11.431 --> 12:14.367
and nopony takes
notes like you.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.170
Uh actually, Twilight,

12:17.204 --> 12:20.373
I wanted to introduce
you to my friend, um...

12:20.407 --> 12:23.376
...Crystal! ...Hoof!

12:23.410 --> 12:27.247
Crystal Hoof, my good
friend, Crystal Hoof.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.316
Nice to meet you.

12:29.349 --> 12:34.021
Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you
too. How do you know Spike?

12:34.054 --> 12:36.790
Oh, Spike and I go way back--

12:36.824 --> 12:38.325
--to the Equestria Games.

12:38.358 --> 12:42.162
That's when we met. We've
been pen pals ever since.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.866
Pen pals! Spike, you could have
been using my pen pal quill set!

12:45.899 --> 12:47.567
Why didn't you tell me?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.537
Well, I-I pretty much
only write to him

12:50.570 --> 12:53.306
when you and Starlight
are studying.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.076
I like to brag to all my
friends about my letters

12:56.109 --> 12:58.345
from Spike the
Brave and Glorious.

12:58.378 --> 13:02.049
[forced laughter]

13:02.082 --> 13:04.217
Well, I'm sure Starlight
and I can manage,

13:04.251 --> 13:06.286
if you want to spend
time with your friend.

13:06.319 --> 13:10.123
Great! Crystal Hoof promised
to take me around the city.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.492
Ha! That was amazing!

13:12.525 --> 13:13.961
I told ya.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.997
**

13:24.938 --> 13:27.941
[no audio over music]

13:38.118 --> 13:40.153
[laughter]

13:44.557 --> 13:47.928
Crystal Hoof is nearly as
entertaining as Spike himself!

13:49.462 --> 13:54.101
Ah! This place is everything
I've ever dreamed of.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.602
But I can't keep
pretending

13:55.635 --> 13:59.106
to be a Crystal
Pony forever, can I?

13:59.139 --> 14:02.109
Relax, you're winning them over.

14:02.142 --> 14:05.913
Pretty soon, nopony will care
that you're a Changeling.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.147
Spike!

14:09.616 --> 14:12.385
Twilight told me you
were off with a friend.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.387
[nervous laugh]

14:14.421 --> 14:17.157
And any friend of Spike
the Brave and Glorious

14:17.190 --> 14:18.291
is a friend of mine.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.064
[baby gurgle]

14:24.097 --> 14:27.200
Oh she's so beautiful!

14:27.234 --> 14:34.241
There's so much LOVE
around her. I-- I-- [roar]!

14:35.142 --> 14:42.149
I, [hiss], I'm so [hiss] sorry!
I can't-can't [hiss] stop.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.219
Spike, get away
from the Changeling!

14:46.253 --> 14:49.656
Wait! No! You
don't understand.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.592
This Changeling replaced your
friend to get close to the baby.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.595
What other explanation
could there be?

14:55.628 --> 14:58.431
* [dramatic]

14:58.465 --> 15:00.367
[roar]

15:00.400 --> 15:01.334
I don't know.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.506
After it! Don't let
the Changeling escape!

15:06.539 --> 15:08.408
I hope your friend is OK.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.980
Yeah... me too.

15:17.184 --> 15:20.988
* [dramatic]

15:21.021 --> 15:23.223
Spike, you should
go find Crystal Hoof

15:23.256 --> 15:25.192
while we hunt down
the Changeling.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.627
I'm pretty sure he
doesn't want to see me.

15:27.660 --> 15:32.399
Spread out! The Changeling
is probably still nearby.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.068
[galloping hooves]

15:35.102 --> 15:36.970
Actually, I'm
pretty sure he ran

15:37.004 --> 15:39.973
as far away from
here as possible.

15:40.007 --> 15:43.343
But I bet I know where!

15:43.376 --> 15:46.679
Thorax? Hello?

15:46.713 --> 15:51.318
I just want to apologize. I
should have stood up for you.

15:51.351 --> 15:56.023
Aw, come on, Thorax.
I know you're in here.

15:56.056 --> 15:59.426
Leave me alone! [hiss]

15:59.459 --> 16:04.497
[scream] Um... little help?

16:04.531 --> 16:09.169
Why do you think I would help
you? I'm an evil Changeling!

16:09.202 --> 16:11.738
Because you're my friend.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.107
I just wish I had
been one to you.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.108
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

16:20.713 --> 16:23.716
It's OK. I know it's hard.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.287
Everyone in the Crystal
Empire loves you.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.557
I couldn't ask you to
give that up for me.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.292
You don't have to ask.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.394
What are you going to do?

16:34.427 --> 16:38.031
What I should have done
in the first place.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.167
Let's move, move, move, move.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.303
Have you checked there?
Look around that corner.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.672
* [suspenseful]

16:45.705 --> 16:47.774
I know it's bad that
there's a Changeling around,

16:47.807 --> 16:51.044
but is all this
really necessary?

16:51.078 --> 16:52.379
If there's one Changeling,

16:52.412 --> 16:54.614
there may well be a
whole army on the way.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.084
True, but Starlight
has a point.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.652
This is getting a
little out of hand.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.789
I understand, but I don't
know what else we can do.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.324
I do!

17:05.525 --> 17:07.427
[gasps]

17:07.460 --> 17:11.198
Spike! What are you doing?
Get away from that thing!

17:11.231 --> 17:16.169
No. He's not a thing. His name
is Thorax. And he's my friend.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.038
[gasps]

17:23.776 --> 17:26.779
**

17:31.384 --> 17:38.291
* Would you say I'm a
hero, glorious and brave *

17:38.325 --> 17:44.631
* If I told you something
you wouldn't believe? *

17:44.664 --> 17:51.471
* That sometimes I'm scared
and I can make mistakes *

17:51.504 --> 17:58.445
* And I'm not so
heroic, it seems *

17:58.478 --> 18:01.748
* But if day can turn to night

18:01.781 --> 18:05.618
* And the darkness
turn to light *

18:05.652 --> 18:11.891
* Then why can't we imagine
a Changeling can change? *

18:11.924 --> 18:18.531
* No two ponies are
exactly the same *

18:18.565 --> 18:23.636
* No two snowflakes ever
match their design *

18:25.638 --> 18:32.279
* And I thought I was strong,
but I was nothing but wrong, *

18:32.312 --> 18:38.885
* When I forgot to be
friendly and kind. *

18:38.918 --> 18:42.522
* But if day can turn to night

18:42.555 --> 18:46.193
* And the darkness
turn to light *

18:46.226 --> 18:51.864
* Then why can't we imagine
a Changeling can change? *

18:53.700 --> 19:00.673
* Would you say I'm a
hero, glorious and brave *

19:00.707 --> 19:07.514
* If I told you something
you wouldn't believe? *

19:07.547 --> 19:14.454
* This Changeling it
seems, knows the real me. *

19:14.487 --> 19:21.361
* And would stay by my
side till the end. *

19:21.394 --> 19:24.931
* So if day can turn to night

19:24.964 --> 19:28.635
* And the darkness
turn to light *

19:28.668 --> 19:32.339
* Then why can't we imagine?

19:32.372 --> 19:38.278
* Just why can't we imagine,
then why can't we imagine *

19:38.311 --> 19:41.581
* the Changeling can change?

19:41.614 --> 19:46.453
* [song ends]

19:58.565 --> 20:01.868
You are?
Spike, I'm so
proud of you.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.305
Of course! You're a celebrity
here in the Crystal Empire

20:05.338 --> 20:07.740
and you just risked
all of it for a friend.

20:07.774 --> 20:11.411
I can't imagine anything
more brave than that.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.246
As the Princess of Friendship,

20:13.280 --> 20:16.015
I try to set an example
for all of Equestria.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.586
But today, it was Spike who
taught me that a new friend

20:19.619 --> 20:22.455
can come from anywhere.
I guess everypony

20:22.489 --> 20:25.958
still has things to learn
about friendship, even me.

20:25.992 --> 20:29.629
And if Spike says Thorax is his
friend, then he's my friend too.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.367
Thank you.

20:34.401 --> 20:38.338
On behalf of the Crystal Empire,
I would like to extend my hoof

20:38.371 --> 20:40.973
in friendship and I am
sure all of my subjects

20:41.007 --> 20:43.042
are eager to do the same.

20:43.075 --> 20:48.281
[cheers]! Yay!

20:52.785 --> 20:55.822
Welcome to the Crystal
Empire, Thorax.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.458
I'm sorry we didn't take the
time to get to know you.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.927
Maybe we can change that now.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.764
That'd be so amazing! I want
to know all about friendship.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.033
And maybe one day I can
take that knowledge back

21:07.066 --> 21:08.868
to the Changeling Kingdom.

21:08.901 --> 21:12.305
If my kind learned how to
create love for one another,

21:12.339 --> 21:14.707
maybe they wouldn't have
to take it from others!

21:14.741 --> 21:16.776
To Spike the Brave and Glorious!

21:16.809 --> 21:21.814
[cheers]

21:25.385 --> 21:26.919
Looks like you were
right after all.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.421
Right about what?

21:28.455 --> 21:31.023
Friendship lessons
can happen anywhere.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.529
* My Little Pony

21:38.398 --> 21:40.700
* My Little Pony

21:51.478 --> 21:53.413
* My Little Pony

21:53.446 --> 21:57.450
