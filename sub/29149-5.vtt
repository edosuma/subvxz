Rhea, we got her.

You get her on board, that's huge.

I want Pierce.

00:20.832 --> 00:22.625
On behalf of the Pierce family,

Could we may... perhaps...

saying, but no. We, uh...

really wanna entrust

05:00.491 --> 05:03.092

23:27.599 --> 23:30.100
on Mount Rushmore, folks! (LAUGHS)

23:30.101 --> 23:31.368
CONNOR: Yeah, yeah, well...

23:31.369 --> 23:32.970
NAN: I actually thought
you said the wrecking ball.

23:32.971 --> 23:34.237
(LAUGHTER)

23:34.872 --> 23:36.072
(DISTANT LAUGHTER)

23:37.775 --> 23:38.908
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

23:40.245 --> 23:42.046
SHIV: I just wanted to say, I'm, uh...

23:42.047 --> 23:45.182
What you're doing, the
PhDs, I think it's great.

23:45.183 --> 23:47.684
- I'm sorry if I...
- MARK: No, no! It was a hit,

23:47.685 --> 23:49.753
- a very palpable hit!
- (LAUGHS)

23:49.754 --> 23:51.121
(LAUGHS) I can take a joke.

23:51.122 --> 23:53.324
Oh, right. Because it
was a joke. (LAUGHS)

23:53.325 --> 23:54.391
Of course.

23:54.392 --> 23:55.816
Are you pleased to be
out of politics, Siobhan?

23:55.817 --> 23:59.663
Oh, yes, I am. I'm getting over
it like a nasty stomach bug.

23:59.664 --> 24:01.398
- Mm-hmm.
- It can be a dirty business.

24:01.399 --> 24:04.700
Made dirtier by a certain
cable news behemoth.

24:04.701 --> 24:07.837
- Oh, come on, Rhea, let's play nice now.
- RHEA: Oh?

24:07.838 --> 24:12.208
We can discuss the white nationalist
elephant in the room, can't we?

24:12.209 --> 24:14.510
Tug on its trunk a bit?

24:14.511 --> 24:16.980
I'm not operationally involved.

24:16.981 --> 24:19.715
(LAUGHS) Come on.

24:19.716 --> 24:22.185
No, no, no, I let my
people do their own thing.

24:22.186 --> 24:25.888
I mean, if you... If you
wanna talk ATN, you know,

24:25.889 --> 24:27.790
Tom's the barbarian.

24:27.791 --> 24:32.862
(LAUGHS) Hi, hello, I'm the...
right-wing ogre at your service.

24:32.863 --> 24:35.831
(LAUGHTER)

24:35.832 --> 24:37.869
NAOMI: Wait, you don't
even believe your own stuff?

24:37.870 --> 24:41.269
Well, I've always wanted to
balance Waystar's portfolio

24:41.270 --> 24:42.870
with, um...

24:43.672 --> 24:46.441
with... voice...

24:46.442 --> 24:50.445
- From the left?
- Well, no. Pierce isn't...

24:50.446 --> 24:54.016
Your people just follow the
truth, wherever it leads, right?

24:54.017 --> 24:58.953
Oh, well, you know, our
people are just hacks.

24:58.954 --> 25:00.322
- (LAUGHTER)
- Oh!

25:00.323 --> 25:02.690
- But we like 'em.
- Come on! (LAUGHS)

25:02.691 --> 25:04.393
I mean, I guess our... our people

25:04.394 --> 25:06.328
try to follow the truth, too, Shiv.

25:06.329 --> 25:08.863
You give them what they need,
we give them what they want.

25:08.864 --> 25:10.532
We make a good match.

25:10.533 --> 25:12.500
Of course. Right. No, Dad...

25:12.501 --> 25:17.204
I think we, Dad, just wants
a bigger tent, a bigger pie.

25:17.205 --> 25:19.206
It means more profit,

25:19.207 --> 25:21.342
and then more investment.

25:21.343 --> 25:24.978
So, I suppose that just
makes me a prim little matron,

25:24.979 --> 25:26.980
if I object to being fumbled

25:26.981 --> 25:28.615
by the invisible hand of the market?

25:28.616 --> 25:30.384
Th... That's... No.

25:30.385 --> 25:31.919
That's not what I meant. I...

25:31.920 --> 25:35.356
Sure, a fair exchange
isn't exactly robbery,

25:35.357 --> 25:38.392
and money does allegedly
make the world go round, so...

25:38.393 --> 25:40.794
Money? Money is a social construct,

25:40.795 --> 25:43.597
whereas virtue, integrity,

25:43.598 --> 25:45.499
these things actually exist.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.834
Well, the... Just... Well,
because just this morning,

25:47.835 --> 25:50.070
I went to the store, and
I bought a pound of ham,

25:50.071 --> 25:51.572
and I paid for it by, you know,

25:51.573 --> 25:52.739
telling them I was really worried

25:52.740 --> 25:53.807
about the environment.

25:53.808 --> 25:55.842
(LAUGHTER)

25:55.843 --> 25:57.878
SHIV: Don't mind Tom, he
finds other people's integrity

25:57.879 --> 25:59.613
a personal affront, for some reason.

25:59.614 --> 26:02.549
(LAUGHS) Well, yes, that's...
Thank you, I'm a piece of dirt.

26:02.550 --> 26:04.451
- (LAUGHTER)
- Oh, yep. Yep. I'll take it.

26:04.452 --> 26:05.852
SHIV: Right! (LAUGHS)

26:05.853 --> 26:10.123
Wait a minute, but Tom, Tom,
if there was an acquisition,

26:10.124 --> 26:11.858
then, as head of news,

26:11.859 --> 26:14.527
you would be the guy in charge
of our crown jewels, right?

26:14.528 --> 26:17.297
Oh, well, we'd have to see about that.

26:17.298 --> 26:19.365
Ooh! Hear that, Tom?

26:19.366 --> 26:21.767
Sounds dicey. Got a pitch?

26:21.768 --> 26:25.305
Tom, everything rests on
what you're about to say.

26:25.306 --> 26:27.574
- (LAUGHTER)
- NAN: Oh, lay off him!

26:27.575 --> 26:30.042
Oh, wait a minute,
though. I didn't hear.

26:30.043 --> 26:33.212
So, would he stay on
as the head of news?

26:35.782 --> 26:38.718
- I...
- Ooh, king of edible leaves,

26:38.719 --> 26:40.352
His Majesty, the spinach.

26:42.590 --> 26:45.558
Look, I just, uh... I think there's...

26:45.559 --> 26:47.527
The business, the journalistic values...

26:47.528 --> 26:49.725
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot of admirers in this family.

26:49.726 --> 26:50.811
That's all.

26:50.812 --> 26:56.635
Uh, like all recent
converts, Shiv is a zealot.

26:56.636 --> 27:00.239
TOM: (LAUGHS) I think what
we can all agree on is that

27:00.240 --> 27:03.942
it's great for people to
communicate, of whatever stripe.

27:03.943 --> 27:07.078
I think it was Thoreau
who said of the telegraph,

27:07.079 --> 27:10.449
"Maine may speak to Texas,
but what if they have nothing

27:10.450 --> 27:12.518
- to say to one another?
- (LAUGHTER)

27:12.519 --> 27:14.819
That should be engraved into
the bezel of every iPhone

27:14.820 --> 27:16.388
- in the world.
- NAN: Oh!

27:16.389 --> 27:19.958
- Hear, hear! The bezel.
- Have you spoken to Shirley?

27:19.959 --> 27:23.262
I'm so sorr... Will you excuse
us for two seconds? I'm so worried

27:23.263 --> 27:25.430
- about our... It's a...
- SHIV: Our dog, Mondale.

27:25.431 --> 27:26.965
It's a dog thing. So silly. Sorry to...

27:26.966 --> 27:28.633
SHIV: Is very ill at the moment.

27:28.634 --> 27:29.700
TOM: Arthritis. We think it's arthritis.

27:29.701 --> 27:31.069
- NAN: So sorry.
- TOM: His hips.

27:31.070 --> 27:32.936
SHIV: Excuse us. Sorry.

27:34.306 --> 27:37.241
They have a dog. A dog named Mondale.

27:37.242 --> 27:39.144
- PETER: Oh!
- That's helpful, right?

27:39.145 --> 27:40.178
PETER: Yeah, it is.

27:40.179 --> 27:42.556
This is... This is what happens.
You get given the keys to the castle,

27:42.557 --> 27:44.983
and then you get paralyzed,
staring into the eyes of the cobra.

27:44.984 --> 27:46.584
You're riding me pretty hard in there.

27:46.585 --> 27:47.686
- (SIGHS)
- You think I should

27:47.687 --> 27:48.877
- fight back more?
- You know, and then,

27:48.878 --> 27:50.801
he smells the vacillation,
and then he's just...

27:50.802 --> 27:53.224
He's got you. You're done.
He's juiced another lemon.

27:53.225 --> 27:55.193
It would be nice if you
stopped beating up on me too.

27:55.194 --> 27:56.556
- What?
- Maybe you could stop

27:56.557 --> 27:59.130
- beating up on me too.
- What? What do...

27:59.131 --> 28:01.598
That's just nothing. That's silly.

28:01.599 --> 28:04.134
- What... No-one cares.
- Well, technically, I care.

28:04.135 --> 28:05.602
- I care.
- Well, sometimes you say

28:05.603 --> 28:08.373
stupid things. You know, he's
got me second-guessing myself.

28:08.374 --> 28:10.895
I'm wavering on the best
strategy for landing a deal

28:10.896 --> 28:11.998
that I don't even like.

28:14.679 --> 28:16.780
- I really want this!
- I know.

28:16.781 --> 28:18.916
Really, I wanna be
sitting at that table.

28:18.917 --> 28:21.884
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- (BREATHES TREMULOUSLY)

28:23.154 --> 28:24.286
Listen to me.

28:25.724 --> 28:27.356
You are sitting at the table.

28:28.727 --> 28:29.826
You are.

28:32.263 --> 28:33.296
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

28:33.297 --> 28:37.365
I'm good. Mm-hmm. Let's go.

28:40.103 --> 28:42.338
TABITHA: They're trying to
adopt. You know, the list is,

28:42.339 --> 28:45.574
like, insane, so I'm thinking,
like, if they can't have a baby

28:45.575 --> 28:49.278
in six months, I'm just gonna,
you know, offer them my womb.

28:49.279 --> 28:51.214
Why not? I'm young, I'm hardy.

28:51.215 --> 28:53.535
MARNIE: I have a friend who
did that. It was so great.

28:53.536 --> 28:56.743
- TABITHA: Mm.
- Uh, but if it's not too rude to ask,

28:56.744 --> 28:59.255
then what about you two?

28:59.256 --> 29:02.758
TABITHA: Oh, you mean us having
a baby? No, we're not planning

29:02.759 --> 29:03.797
- to have a baby, because...
- Oop.

29:03.798 --> 29:05.261
... that would require us having sex.

29:05.262 --> 29:07.522
- Whoa! Hey now.
- PETER: I'm so sorry.

29:07.523 --> 29:09.765
- I don't mean to pry.
- Oh, yes you did.

29:09.766 --> 29:12.067
No, no, no, no. It's
totally fine. That's just...

29:12.068 --> 29:15.437
That's, like, not how we
do it. It's not our thing.

29:15.438 --> 29:17.773
We're kind of like eunuch besties.

29:17.774 --> 29:19.975
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- It works for us.

29:19.976 --> 29:23.412
It's a joke, obviously.
She's kidding. We're actually

29:23.413 --> 29:27.383
quite relentless in that
regard. Just Fuck City.

29:27.384 --> 29:30.586
- (PUNCHES PALM)
- Bingo, bango, bongo.

29:30.587 --> 29:33.555
TABITHA: Anyway, you
don't have any kids, right?

29:33.556 --> 29:35.824
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

29:35.825 --> 29:39.059
- Refreshed?
- Oh? Uh...

29:40.730 --> 29:43.231
Yeah. Yep, you bet.

29:43.232 --> 29:47.127
NAN: Marcia, so, so tell me.
You... You grew up in Beirut.

29:47.128 --> 29:48.336
What was that like?

29:48.337 --> 29:51.606
LOGAN: Well, she... She doesn't
really like to talk about it.

29:51.607 --> 29:54.876
Or you don't like to ask about it.

29:54.877 --> 29:59.214
Well, um... when we first
met, the first or second night,

29:59.215 --> 30:02.184
we stayed up all night, um...

30:02.185 --> 30:05.687
And she told me her whole life story.

30:05.688 --> 30:09.825
If I had a year, I couldn't
tell you my whole life.

30:09.826 --> 30:13.728
- LOGAN: Uh-huh. Fine.
- Interesting.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.797
Another glass for both of you?

30:15.798 --> 30:18.032
Well, now, we tend to
kind of keep it to...

30:18.033 --> 30:19.132
Yes, thank you.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.768
LOGAN: Excuse me?

30:21.769 --> 30:25.138
His cellar is all New World,
and it doesn't suit me.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.641
Well, why didn't you say?

30:27.642 --> 30:33.080
It suits you, so it can suit me.
See? I'm not a difficult person.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.316
- Uh-huh.
- NAN: Well, as long as

30:35.317 --> 30:39.253
the fat is being chewed,
I suppose I would be remiss

30:39.254 --> 30:40.988
not to mention that
you're being targeted

30:40.989 --> 30:43.357
for acquisition yourself, correct?

30:43.358 --> 30:45.425
Oh, oh, that. Well, that's...

30:45.426 --> 30:47.328
(CHUCKLES) You know, that's all over.

30:47.329 --> 30:49.930
- Well, alas.
- Sandy's not well.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.265
Syphilis, if you can believe it.

30:52.266 --> 30:55.335
LOGAN: Uh. I... Yeah. I never...

30:55.336 --> 30:57.503
I never believed that the takeover bid

30:57.504 --> 31:01.774
- was real to begin with.
- Hmm. A Potemkin pillage.

31:01.775 --> 31:03.876
(LAUGHS)

31:05.445 --> 31:09.749
Oh, look, I have to ask.
The internal differences.

31:09.750 --> 31:13.452
- Have they been smoothed over?
- Oh, very much so.

31:13.453 --> 31:18.758
And any thought given to whom
you might hand over the keys?

31:18.759 --> 31:21.227
Why, Madam, that is very forward.

31:21.228 --> 31:22.727
And you're no fun.

31:24.198 --> 31:26.999
We're all friends here now, aren't we?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.434
Well, uh...

31:29.435 --> 31:32.670
Gerri is on the paperwork as a stopgap,

31:32.671 --> 31:35.908
but even she'd be the first
to admit that she couldn't

31:35.909 --> 31:37.474
really do the job.

31:38.644 --> 31:40.345
Well, maybe the second to admit.

31:40.346 --> 31:41.812
(LAUGHTER)

31:42.515 --> 31:45.383
Uh... There is a name.

31:46.953 --> 31:51.189
But, you know, I really don't
like to deal in hypotheticals.

31:51.190 --> 31:54.559
Ooh. He's an enigma.

31:54.560 --> 31:58.362
- LOGAN: Well, one day.
- RHEA: What a tease, folks.

31:59.799 --> 32:05.336
- Just whisper it in my ear.
- You know, I'll start to think

32:05.337 --> 32:06.837
I'm not wanted.

32:08.140 --> 32:09.641
(CHUCKLES)

32:09.642 --> 32:11.742
(LAUGHING) Just... You can...

32:12.678 --> 32:14.312
Well, you know, uh...

32:14.313 --> 32:16.914
Oh, for fuck's sake, Dad, just
tell them it's gonna be me.

32:21.821 --> 32:24.521
- NAN: Is that so?
- That is so.

32:26.525 --> 32:30.094
- Roman, what's happening?
- Mm. My life just ended.

32:30.095 --> 32:33.297
It's been discussed, um,
but I don't think we're quite

32:33.298 --> 32:37.701
- at the point where, uh...
- No, not any time soon.

32:37.702 --> 32:40.371
We've, uh... We've
discussed the transition

32:40.372 --> 32:43.207
- and some arrangements.
- We won't bore you.

32:43.208 --> 32:49.213
No! (LAUGHS) But I though we
could tell you all, though,

32:49.214 --> 32:50.547
as friends.

32:50.548 --> 32:52.816
PETER: Yeah. You know, maybe this dinner

32:52.817 --> 32:55.719
was a little bit premature.
Seems like you guys

32:55.720 --> 32:57.121
are still working some things out.

32:57.122 --> 33:00.591
No, no, Peter, don't worry,
this is just family hijinks,

33:00.592 --> 33:03.760
- as usual. We're good.
- Is that true?

33:03.761 --> 33:06.762
- (SHOUTING) Will you stop?
- (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

33:13.904 --> 33:18.008
Well, anyway, I, um...
I was just thinking,

33:18.009 --> 33:21.644
it is such a beautiful,
clear night out. Uh...

33:21.645 --> 33:23.912
- Mark...
- MARK: Huh.

33:25.282 --> 33:30.520
- NAN: Mark?
- I said, "Huh". (CHUCKLES)

33:30.521 --> 33:34.424
Would you like to guide us on
a little after-dinner stargaze?

33:34.425 --> 33:38.561
Uh, stargaze? I would love
to show you our little corner

33:38.562 --> 33:42.398
- of the sky. (LAUGHS)
- NAN: (LAUGHS) Marvelous.

33:42.399 --> 33:44.534
Boots for everyone, not to worry.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

33:48.438 --> 33:54.509
- TABITHA: Mm. Did you know?
- Uh, no. No, I did not know.

34:10.694 --> 34:14.362
(FLICKING GLASS)

34:20.136 --> 34:21.235
Shall we?

34:23.139 --> 34:26.408
(SHIV BREATHING HEAVILY)

34:26.409 --> 34:31.179
Keep in mind that I got
my PhD at Columbia in '89,

34:31.181 --> 34:35.684
so I'm not what Whitman would
call a "learned astronomer".

34:35.685 --> 34:37.286
(LAUGHS)

34:37.286 --> 34:40.422
MARK: Right? No, but... So, I wish
I could show you through, uh...

34:40.422 --> 34:42.690
Through a telescope,
but our naked eyes...

34:42.692 --> 34:46.594
- Having fun?
- Oh, sure.

34:46.596 --> 34:51.600
- I am having fun.
- NAOMI: (SCOFFS) Me too.

34:51.601 --> 34:55.503
- KENDALL: You too?
- Watching you people melt down

34:55.504 --> 35:02.375
is the most deeply satisfying
activity on planet Earth.

35:03.345 --> 35:06.280
Oh, yeah? Uh-huh.

35:06.281 --> 35:09.584
- Thank you.
- Sure. You got it.

35:09.585 --> 35:12.519
We, uh... We aim to please.

35:13.990 --> 35:16.958
No, I... feel quite redundant.

35:16.959 --> 35:19.160
I mean, I came here to
fuck any deal, but...

35:19.161 --> 35:23.597
it seems you all have just
fucked it yourselves, so...

35:31.406 --> 35:32.572
So...

35:35.277 --> 35:36.476
are you gonna ask me?

35:38.747 --> 35:39.879
Ask you what?

35:41.816 --> 35:44.018
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

35:44.019 --> 35:46.220
Would you like to do some
illegal drugs with me?

35:46.221 --> 35:50.089
- Yes, I would.
- Good. This way.

35:51.426 --> 35:54.262
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

35:54.263 --> 35:55.495
SHIV: Okay, goodnight.

TOM: (BREATHING HEAVILY)
Jeepers-fucking-creepers,

36:05.105 --> 36:07.574
what a shit-piñata. That was like...

36:07.575 --> 36:11.678
That was like the most
Roy thing I have ever seen.

36:11.679 --> 36:14.914
It's like I got a quart of
Roy injected into my eyeballs.

36:14.915 --> 36:17.484
- (GRUNTS) Is there booze?
- Are you kidding?

36:17.485 --> 36:20.720
No, it's just Emily Dickinson
and low-thread-count sheets.

36:20.721 --> 36:22.155
- Shiv, what...
- (SIGHING)

36:22.156 --> 36:24.591
What even was that?
Explain the chess move.

36:24.592 --> 36:27.994
I... I don't know. I just... I
just... I just fucking said it.

36:27.995 --> 36:31.798
- You just said it? No plan?
- No, not really. I...

36:31.799 --> 36:33.432
I guess I thought, you know, "Fuck him.

36:33.433 --> 36:35.267
Fuck him for stringing me along!"

36:35.268 --> 36:37.170
Just, you know, shit or get off the pot.

36:37.171 --> 36:39.305
Right. Right?

36:39.306 --> 36:42.141
But, you know, I guess I didn't
really think that so much as...

36:42.142 --> 36:45.444
As, you know, just...
Oh, Jesus Christ, my head.

36:45.445 --> 36:47.780
Because I'm not sure how
much love there is for me

36:47.781 --> 36:50.850
in a... as a sort of independent-of-you

36:50.851 --> 36:52.518
sort of person. You know?

36:52.519 --> 36:54.453
(SIGHS) Yeah, my dad doesn't
really like to be pushed.

36:54.454 --> 36:57.056
- No.
- No, so there could be repercussions.

36:57.057 --> 36:59.057
- Like what?
- Yeah, like, uh...

37:00.094 --> 37:01.359
I don't know, just like...

37:02.863 --> 37:04.597
Like if, uh, I've fucked it.

37:04.598 --> 37:06.631
- You've fucked it?
- (PUTS BRACELET DOWN)

37:08.335 --> 37:09.400
Right.

37:14.441 --> 37:15.540
Right.

37:16.809 --> 37:20.346
- (SNORTS)
- (GULPS)

37:20.347 --> 37:21.846
I used to be a maniac.

37:24.284 --> 37:28.186
A beast, but... It's a different
situation for me now.

37:28.187 --> 37:29.854
Right. (LAUGHS)

37:30.890 --> 37:32.258
(BOTH LAUGHING)

37:32.259 --> 37:34.293
- You should hear yourself.
- Screw you.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.027
- Yeah.
- Okay?

37:36.028 --> 37:39.565
- (SNORTS)
- But there are levels.

37:39.566 --> 37:42.233
Sure. No, it's true. Yeah,
I mean, I was basically

37:42.234 --> 37:44.200
hanging by a fucking thread.

37:46.938 --> 37:49.707
I'm coming through, you know?

37:49.708 --> 37:53.209
- Like, I'm getting it together.
- Mm-hmm.

37:54.713 --> 37:57.013
(SNIFFS) Yeah, me too.

38:00.252 --> 38:02.218
- I know how that sounds, but...
- (LAUGHS)

38:03.689 --> 38:04.788
... it's true.

38:06.292 --> 38:09.394
(LAUGHS)

38:09.395 --> 38:10.428
I can't even...

38:10.429 --> 38:12.263
TABITHA: Those stars were amazing.

38:12.264 --> 38:14.265
Can't even brush my fucking teeth now.

38:14.266 --> 38:16.200
Such a fun weekend you brought me on.

38:16.201 --> 38:20.704
Well. Am I stupid? Am I a
fucking idiot? Am I stupid?

38:20.705 --> 38:22.039
- Ro?
- Yeah.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.974
- I... I have a meeting on Monday.
- Uh-huh.

38:23.975 --> 38:26.376
You know? And so I'd just,
like... I really wanna

38:26.377 --> 38:28.746
deal with all your
neuroses and talk about it

38:28.747 --> 38:31.515
and everything, but if you're
gonna get kind of crazy...

38:31.516 --> 38:34.251
- Mm-hmm.
- ... I might just see if Naomi

38:34.252 --> 38:36.153
would let me, you
know, crash in her bed.

38:36.154 --> 38:39.323
- All right. Let's fuck.
- Yeah, totally.

38:39.324 --> 38:41.858
We do the sex so well,
so, that's a great idea.

38:41.859 --> 38:44.561
All right, come on. Come here,
you hot fucking piece of shit.

38:44.562 --> 38:47.164
- (LAUGHING) Okay, okay, easy!
- (MOANS)

38:47.165 --> 38:49.132
- Easy there, wolfman.
- Sorry.

38:49.133 --> 38:50.867
- TABITHA: (LAUGHING) Oh, Jesus!
- ROMAN: That was awesome.

38:50.868 --> 38:54.204
- I'm so fucking good at this.
- TABITHA: Christ!

38:54.205 --> 38:55.604
- Oh!
- ROMAN: Sorry.

38:55.605 --> 38:57.245
- It just was like...
- I know.

38:57.246 --> 38:58.975
... really squeezing
hard with your finger.

38:58.976 --> 39:01.277
- It was really sexy.
- (LAUGHS)

39:01.278 --> 39:03.679
- Oh, how I just took you.
- (LAUGHS)

39:03.680 --> 39:07.783
That was great. Um, do you...
Do you wanna, though? Can we...

39:07.784 --> 39:09.252
Do you wanna?

39:09.253 --> 39:10.519
- Okay.
- Yeah.

39:10.520 --> 39:14.157
Do I want to... make love with me?

39:14.158 --> 39:15.824
No. Wow. (GRUNTS)

Hey, hey. I'm not, uh...

39:22.867 --> 39:26.133
I'm not uninterested in solving you.

39:28.171 --> 39:32.007
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

39:32.008 --> 39:34.876
Do you think there's a
way that we can, like...

39:36.580 --> 39:39.947
make it kinda like wrong?

I'm just gonna put the light on.

you didn't do that. That's...

I know, I just... I'm a
person who needs, like...

41:22.484 --> 41:24.485
- Tabs, you're meant to be dead.
- ... visual stimulation

41:24.486 --> 41:25.886
- to get into it, so...
- I know, I get that, but I...

41:25.887 --> 41:27.805
- That will help us, I promise you.
- What about my needs? But don't...

41:27.806 --> 41:29.257
Sure. I thought we could
just, like, try. You could just

41:29.258 --> 41:31.048
- keep your eyes closed...
- Yeah, but you shouldn't be

41:31.049 --> 41:32.649
turned on, because
dead women aren't wet.

is closing for the night.

just saying, if we, like,

politely agree on a wrong
thing, then it's no longer wrong.

on top and... (LAUGHS)

... I... wrapped my fucking
Audi around a highway divider.

43:19.966 --> 43:22.566

You know what the
funny thing is, though?

43:39.151 --> 43:41.118
That my wrist will never fully heal?

Or there's photos of me

out from under all this.

Right? You can take the money...

44:10.714 --> 44:12.781
and you can just get the fuck out.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.618
And then what?

44:17.615 --> 44:18.747
Then, you're free.

moron would've figured it out.

from the training program.

of our special conference calls

46:01.990 --> 46:03.757

- Hi.

46:09.164 --> 46:10.611
Wait, is that why you're here?

46:10.612 --> 46:13.735

Maybe. I don't know. No.

46:16.004 --> 46:17.971
Roman, this is unacceptable.

46:17.972 --> 46:19.873
This is completely inappropriate.

46:19.874 --> 46:21.403
- Yeah?
- What would your family say

46:21.404 --> 46:22.442
if they knew you were here?

Oh, well, my family jimmy-fuck-corn,

- No.
- Yeah, I know you do.

46:28.916 --> 46:33.019
And they would be ashamed
of you, and rightly so.

46:33.020 --> 46:35.455
Okay, I'm very sorry,
Gerri how are you...

46:35.456 --> 46:37.624
No, you don't get to speak.

46:37.625 --> 46:39.526
You have always been a disappointment,

46:39.527 --> 46:42.662
but this is just... You
have gone beyond the pale.

46:44.565 --> 46:46.433

- Oh, yeah.

46:49.369 --> 46:51.203

46:51.204 --> 46:55.640
You're a sick fuck. You're
a sick fucking animal.

46:56.943 --> 46:59.611

47:01.782 --> 47:04.148
Get in that bathroom. Now!

47:06.186 --> 47:07.285
Go on.

47:08.722 --> 47:09.922
And you will stay in there

47:09.923 --> 47:12.657
until you have done
something with yourself.

47:19.199 --> 47:20.833
You have a problem, Roman.

47:20.834 --> 47:23.368
A revolting problem in your head.

be anything but a disgrace,</i>

- Um...
- Fun?

49:17.547 --> 49:21.150
I jerked off in Gerri's
bathroom last night.

49:21.151 --> 49:22.484

- Yeah.

49:22.485 --> 49:24.219
- So classy of you.
- KENDALL: Morning.

49:24.220 --> 49:26.855
It's okay. Don't worry about
it. It was actually her idea.

49:26.856 --> 49:29.658
Think it really got the
old gal's juices flowing.

49:29.659 --> 49:32.428
Even as a joke, that is
a stomach-turning thought.

49:32.429 --> 49:34.263

- Yeah.

50:01.490 --> 50:02.589
Good.

50:06.328 --> 50:11.565
So, the family had a closed-door
meeting this morning.

50:11.566 --> 50:15.935
- Uh-huh. Bad or good?
- I'm sorry, but, uh...

50:15.936 --> 50:19.139
I'm blind on this one
too. You know, I...

50:19.140 --> 50:22.842
I thought you'd have more time,
and I thought I could get in

50:22.843 --> 50:26.346
and waggle the old screwdriver,
but, uh, she doesn't always

50:26.347 --> 50:28.415
listen to me.

50:28.416 --> 50:32.519
- So?
- But Nan would like to meet

50:32.520 --> 50:39.125
you, Marcia, Gerri, Shiv,
Kendall after breakfast.

50:43.197 --> 50:45.797
Relax. It's only life or death.

50:58.779 --> 51:04.049
Please, take a seat. (CLEARS THROAT)

51:06.219 --> 51:07.887
Is Marcia coming?

51:07.888 --> 51:10.790
LOGAN: Uh, she's gone for a walk.

51:10.791 --> 51:14.393
She is a credit. A lot
of men in your station,

51:14.394 --> 51:18.564
they go for, uh, a certain... type.

51:20.267 --> 51:24.437
Anyway, we all managed
to get through an evening

51:24.438 --> 51:27.373
pleasantly enough. That's
not why we're here, is it?

51:27.374 --> 51:30.276
No, it's not.

51:30.277 --> 51:34.746
NAN: I have no illusions
about who Logan Roy is.

51:34.747 --> 51:37.583
Who his children are. I'm not an idiot.

51:37.584 --> 51:40.319
Well, something has to be
done. Eight straight quarters

51:40.320 --> 51:43.855
of losses is a hard truth,
and we can't do good news

51:43.856 --> 51:46.357
- without deep pockets.
- Uh-huh.

51:47.894 --> 51:50.929
Call me a romantic, but I happen
to believe that the presence

51:50.930 --> 51:54.199
of Pierce news cameras was
what stopped certain East German

51:54.200 --> 51:57.802
border guards from opening fire in 1989.

51:57.803 --> 52:00.104
We helped take down that wall.

52:00.772 --> 52:01.871
Yes.

52:02.575 --> 52:04.275
Commendable.

52:04.276 --> 52:07.077
You may not believe that, but I do.

52:08.280 --> 52:10.615
Now, here we are.

52:10.616 --> 52:15.320
On the one hand, I do
not like you very much.

52:15.321 --> 52:18.456
And I do not like your politics.

52:18.457 --> 52:22.460
On the other hand, I had
a conversation this morning

52:22.461 --> 52:26.797
with my cousin Naomi, and
she believes that a sale

52:26.798 --> 52:31.234
is the only way to ensure
that Pierce Media can flourish.

52:32.937 --> 52:35.104
And that may be where we are.

52:38.009 --> 52:40.010
Rhea, what do you think?

52:40.011 --> 52:44.514
I think... I think we're worth more.

52:45.883 --> 52:47.451
We have made a very generous offer

52:47.452 --> 52:49.419
in terms of market valuations.

52:49.420 --> 52:52.189
- RHEA: Nevertheless.
- I don't like to be squeezed.

52:52.190 --> 52:55.124
- I thought we had a number.
- Uh-huh.

52:57.595 --> 53:01.297
Yeah. And, uh, I mean...

53:03.034 --> 53:04.133
Hmm.

53:06.036 --> 53:07.869
I could go to 25.

53:08.805 --> 53:10.805
But it would have to be fast.

53:12.543 --> 53:16.179
Then, in that case...
with a certain heaviness

53:16.180 --> 53:19.815
of heart, if I honestly had
to say, from the family's

53:19.816 --> 53:21.183
point of view...

53:24.821 --> 53:25.887
yes.

53:27.324 --> 53:29.392
(NAN CLEARS THROAT)

53:29.393 --> 53:35.398
Very well. If we can clear
up our ethical concerns,

53:35.399 --> 53:37.232
I think we can talk.

53:37.233 --> 53:39.868
We would like to
retain some board seats,

53:39.869 --> 53:44.073
and get ironclad editorial
protections in place.

53:44.074 --> 53:46.709
I think that could be hammered out.

53:46.710 --> 53:49.544
- NAN: Also.
- Also.

53:49.545 --> 53:52.715
I think we would also
like to have a conversation

53:52.716 --> 53:54.649
about management.

53:54.650 --> 53:57.652
- LOGAN: Uh-huh.
- I won't have that man

53:57.653 --> 54:01.590
overseeing our news. I'm
sorry. It's just not tenable.

54:01.591 --> 54:03.658
That won't be a problem.

54:03.659 --> 54:09.297
NAN: More important, we would
like you to publicly announce

54:09.298 --> 54:10.431
a successor.

54:11.701 --> 54:13.000
LOGAN: Mm-hmm.

54:13.001 --> 54:16.403
And we would like the
person you publicly announce

54:16.404 --> 54:18.571
to be Siobhan Roy.

54:21.110 --> 54:22.408
LOGAN: Well...

54:23.846 --> 54:26.412
that's not quite how I do things.

54:27.649 --> 54:31.652
Well, it will have to
be, or there's no deal.

54:31.653 --> 54:34.622
We want to announce the sale
and Shiv at the same time,

54:34.623 --> 54:37.424
because, frankly, she may be
one of you, but she's young,

54:37.425 --> 54:41.562
she's a woman, and her politics
fit better with the core values

54:41.563 --> 54:45.564
of our family business. So...

54:47.635 --> 54:49.135
that's the offer.

54:50.571 --> 54:54.940
Well, to be fair, you
don't have an offer.

54:56.577 --> 54:58.344
I have an offer.

54:58.345 --> 55:01.446
And if I announce my daughter,

55:02.984 --> 55:08.121
my daughter will be
announced on my time.

55:08.122 --> 55:11.758
NAN: Okay. Let me explain something.

55:11.759 --> 55:15.228

- You can't put a value

55:15.229 --> 55:16.595
on what we do.

55:17.832 --> 55:21.534
Funny. I have put a
value on what you do.

55:21.535 --> 55:28.507
Well, if you won't budge, then
I'm afraid we have no deal.

55:39.953 --> 55:41.085
