00:04.830 --> 00:06.223
<i>Previously on</i> CSI: Vegas...

00:06.354 --> 00:08.269
- Something brought you back.
- Grace Huang.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.010
<i>Rock star in my program.</i>

00:10.140 --> 00:11.228
<i>She left work one night,</i>

00:11.359 --> 00:12.490
<i>and no one's seen her since.</i>

00:12.621 --> 00:13.665
When Catherine asked around

00:13.796 --> 00:15.885
<i>at the casino, they fired her.</i>

00:16.016 --> 00:17.234
Where'd she go?
Is there really not a camera

00:17.365 --> 00:19.193
covering the area
between those angles?

00:19.323 --> 00:21.412
I don't know what you think
happened to this girl,

00:21.543 --> 00:22.457
<i>but I want to help.</i>

00:22.587 --> 00:23.893
It has to be Grace's grave.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.329
They moved her body.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.375
Is that tortoiseshell?

00:27.505 --> 00:29.072
Last I checked, there weren't
many tortoises roaming around

00:29.203 --> 00:30.856
that far north
in the desert.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.162
Someone gave that to Grace,

00:32.293 --> 00:33.511
day before she went missing.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.948
<i>Mikel Koslov.</i>

00:36.079 --> 00:38.255
- You know him?
- He hoped on his private jet yesterday.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.388
He's hiding in Belarus.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.564
<i>She knew something
he was trying to keep quiet.</i>

00:42.694 --> 00:44.044
<i>Something that got her killed.</i>

01:11.854 --> 01:13.290
Hello, Mikel.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.685
- Bye, ladies.
- What is this?

01:17.642 --> 01:20.080
- Who are you?
- My name is Catherine Willows.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.125
I work for CSI in Las Vegas.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.692
I'm here about Grace Huang.

01:23.822 --> 01:26.869
I was not even in your country
when it happened.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.000
When she was murdered.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.480
I don't know anything about it.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.613
That, I don't believe.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.009
I don't care what you believe.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.837
Your laws do not apply here.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.404
Yeah, you're right.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.450
But that works
in my favor, too.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.669
The FBI might not appreciate
that I'm using

01:44.800 --> 01:46.802
their file to blackmail you.

01:46.932 --> 01:49.805
Ooh, there is
a lot in there, Mikel.

01:49.935 --> 01:53.156
You've been embezzling from
half the criminals in Belarus.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.853
I don't know what...

01:54.984 --> 01:56.420
If some of
those folks find out,

01:56.551 --> 01:58.335
you'll be lucky
if you get to keep...

01:59.771 --> 02:00.903
...all your fingers.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.776
What do you want?

02:06.735 --> 02:08.258
Get dressed.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.564
We're going to Vegas.

02:09.694 --> 02:10.956
You have a date
with the district attorney.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.616
So, this missing friend
of yours, Grace Huang,

02:18.747 --> 02:20.270
you have no proof of foul play?

02:20.401 --> 02:21.750
Nothing concrete,

02:21.880 --> 02:23.621
but that could change today,
or so I'm told.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.449
Mr. Koslov here

02:25.580 --> 02:28.322
has an alibi for the day
of Grace's disappearance.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.280
He couldn't have killed her, but...

02:30.411 --> 02:32.543
I know who did, where they put
the body, I know all of it.

02:32.674 --> 02:33.936
Ms. Huang was murdered?

02:34.980 --> 02:37.331
My client is prepared
to offer testimony

02:37.461 --> 02:39.376
once certain guaranties
are made.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.336
That he will not be prosecuted
as an accessory, or...

02:42.466 --> 02:44.251
I want immunity,
for everything.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.122
Everything?
What does that mean?

02:46.253 --> 02:47.689
Grace was a server
at a private poker room,

02:47.819 --> 02:49.212
where she met Mikel

02:49.343 --> 02:51.649
and some other... entrepreneurs.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.086
I suspect that she learned
something there

02:54.217 --> 02:55.305
that got her killed.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.480
I don't know what.

02:56.611 --> 02:59.091
My client does,
and I can assure you,

02:59.222 --> 03:01.311
it will be of great interest
to your office.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.099
I don't have the authority
to grant blanket immunity

03:07.230 --> 03:08.362
based on your assessment

03:08.492 --> 03:11.539
of whatever this testimony
might be.

03:11.669 --> 03:14.411
These people I deal with...
very dangerous.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.761
I cannot talk before immunity,
before protection.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.633
Well, then, I'm afraid
we're at an impasse,

03:18.763 --> 03:19.634
because I can't grant you

03:19.764 --> 03:20.678
the protection you need

03:20.809 --> 03:22.376
if you don't play ball, sir.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.987
Mister...

03:26.162 --> 03:28.643
Who brought this water?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.950
This is Catherine Willows, C114,
send an ambulance.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.909
- Clark County D.A.'s office.
- Breathe.

03:34.039 --> 03:36.738
Try to breathe. Immediately.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.435
Ma'am, please back up.

03:38.566 --> 03:39.697
- Mikel.
- I need to get him
to the hospital.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.656
Mikel, look at me.
Who killed Grace?

03:41.786 --> 03:43.266
My client cannot. Please.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.355
Please, we can work out
a deal if he makes it.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.183
- Ms. Ms.... Ms. Willows.
- There's no reason
why he cannot tell me

03:47.314 --> 03:49.011
why my friend... Ms.-Ms. Willows, please.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.013
My client can't talk.

03:51.143 --> 03:52.101
Someone poisoned the man.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.929
He's talking. Today.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.628
I'll meet you in the lobby!

04:08.422 --> 04:09.510
Where's Mikel?

04:09.640 --> 04:11.729
He-he punched me.
He got off on two.

04:12.774 --> 04:13.818
He made a run for it.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.226
<i>He's just gone?</i>

04:30.357 --> 04:32.097
He knows who
killed my daughter.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.490
Why wouldn't
he just tell you?

04:33.621 --> 04:35.231
Mikel didn't trust the D.A.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.015
He didn't think
that we could protect him

04:37.146 --> 04:39.931
from his associates
if he talks.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.542
Ms. Huang, we have an APB
out on him.

04:41.672 --> 04:45.459
My team here at CSI
is up to speed.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.199
And if he is dumb enough
to pop up at the Eclipse,

04:47.330 --> 04:49.593
your friend there is
gonna let us know, right?

04:49.724 --> 04:51.813
Yes. Jodi's keeping an eye out.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.598
I-I brought some photos.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.034
Some of Grace's things.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.167
I thought
it might help somehow.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.648
I just...

05:00.778 --> 05:02.476
I need to do something.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.220
Thank you.

05:08.351 --> 05:12.573
When Grace didn't call
after my bypass surgery...

05:12.703 --> 05:15.010
I was so hurt.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.839
But I should've known
something was wrong.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.014
I should've reported it.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.885
It's not your fault.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.801
When Grace disappeared,

05:23.932 --> 05:26.500
I asked everyone where she went,
and nobody knew.

05:28.110 --> 05:30.591
Your daughter is
the reason I'm here,

05:30.721 --> 05:34.290
and I'm not gonna stop
until this is over.

05:35.639 --> 05:36.640
Catherine.

05:36.771 --> 05:37.989
They found him.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.122
Converted warehouse
in Henderson.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.871
You need a
minute, or...?

05:50.001 --> 05:51.351
Tell me what we have, Detective.

05:51.481 --> 05:54.528
Well, given the timing,

05:54.658 --> 05:56.094
I got to think the same people

05:56.225 --> 05:57.444
who were worried
about Grace talking

05:57.574 --> 05:58.793
wanted to keep him
quiet, too.

05:58.923 --> 06:00.316
They made a hell of
a mess doing it.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.404
Yeah.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.710
Turned some fake Van Goghs

06:02.840 --> 06:04.973
into real Jackson Pollocks.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.022
Wound is big.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.415
From a large caliber.

06:12.546 --> 06:13.938
Neighbor heard shots,
called it in.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.679
The killer fled

06:15.810 --> 06:17.159
when first
responders arrived.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.682
Where's the second vic?

06:18.813 --> 06:20.075
By the back door,

06:20.205 --> 06:21.816
next to
the antique printing press.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.470
An antique what?

06:23.600 --> 06:26.603
This guy's our homeowner.
Anton Koslov.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.997
Mikel's nephew.
His sheet is full

06:29.127 --> 06:30.955
of fun stuff.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.697
Counterfeit, forgery,
kiting checks,

06:33.828 --> 06:34.872
you know, fraud city.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.005
And, as you can see,

06:37.135 --> 06:38.485
he worked from home.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.883
Crazy, right?

06:46.014 --> 06:47.450
Everything in here is fake.

06:48.625 --> 06:49.931
I don't know about that.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.020
The smell of death
is pretty real.

06:53.848 --> 06:56.416
I'm sorry, Catherine.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.287
I know you were counting
on him to tell you

06:58.418 --> 07:00.463
who killed your friend.

07:00.594 --> 07:04.162
Yeah. Well...

07:04.293 --> 07:07.035
now this crime scene's
just gonna have to tell us.

Hey, you all right?

07:57.564 --> 07:58.913
Uh, yeah.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.741
People
who killed Grace

08:00.871 --> 08:02.482
didn't want
Mikel Koslov to talk?

08:02.612 --> 08:05.180
Either that, or it's just
one hell of a coincidence.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.182
Who's this fellow?

08:07.312 --> 08:08.444
Collateral damage?

08:08.575 --> 08:10.054
Mikel's nephew, Anton.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.100
He had a little counterfeiting
operation here,

08:12.230 --> 08:13.536
as you can see.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.972
- Nice place to lay low.
- Is there any chance

08:15.103 --> 08:16.670
that he sold the wrong fake
to the wrong buyer?

08:16.800 --> 08:19.542
More likely he got caught up
hiding the wrong fugitive.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.155
Anton's widow
just got here.

08:25.461 --> 08:26.462
Go on, talk to her.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.159
We'll process all this.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.988
Looks like a Sotheby's
exploded in here.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.250
Never buy
me jewelry, babe.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.383
None of this is real.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.080
I'm not seeing any real brass, either.

08:36.211 --> 08:39.127
Yeah, haven't found
any casings.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.781
I'm pretty sure
the perp was cleaning up

08:40.911 --> 08:41.869
when he got interrupted
by the cops.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.653
Yeah.

08:43.784 --> 08:47.135
Question is, what did he miss?

08:49.311 --> 08:52.270
- GSR is negative.
- I told you. I would never.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.533
Who would have?

08:53.663 --> 08:54.621
Did your husband have
any enemies?

08:54.751 --> 08:58.450
No. My Anton was
the sweetest man.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.713
An artist.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.628
He could do anything.

09:01.758 --> 09:05.719
Paint, sculpt, sew.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.068
Apparently, even put you
in a Vermeer.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.331
So, what were
the two of you doing

09:09.461 --> 09:11.507
in a house full of
counterfeit merchandise?

09:11.638 --> 09:15.990
Uncle Mikel brought knockoffs,
jewelry, anything.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.992
Anton could make it
look so real.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.081
He just did as he was told.

09:20.211 --> 09:23.127
Neither of you had any idea
what he was involved in?

09:23.258 --> 09:25.216
Come on, Katya.

09:27.392 --> 09:31.266
This woman, Grace Huang,
do you recognize her?

09:32.267 --> 09:33.703
No.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.662
Not that I can recall.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.446
Something Mikel was involved in
got her killed, too.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.752
She was my friend.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.449
If you know anything--I'm sorry,

09:40.580 --> 09:43.321
but she isn't the only one
whose future was taken.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.889
All I know is,

09:46.020 --> 09:48.457
whoever did this
was here for Mikel,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.764
and they didn't care
who else got hurt.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.202
I hope you find them.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.486
Whoa. Uh-oh.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.227
This stuff will kill you.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.404
Anton and Katya are stocked up
on health food.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.928
I'm thinking Mikel brought
this crap to go off the grid.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.887
He didn't even last
till dinner.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.628
So, killer didn't
leave much.

10:28.758 --> 10:32.370
I got cigarette ash
and a .41 mag slug.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.764
Hmm. That's not
the most common caliber.

10:34.895 --> 10:36.810
No, and there's
something else.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.028
Mikel got hit in the neck,

10:38.159 --> 10:40.509
and it really sprayed
these three,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.293
you know,
old-looking ones.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.731
That one's a reproduction of
<i>Lilies in a Jug.</i>

10:44.861 --> 10:46.297
Van Gogh.

10:46.428 --> 10:49.039
Anton really was
a talented forger.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.172
I mean, it's incredible
use of light.

10:53.217 --> 10:54.784
Oh, Penny got me
a coffee table book

10:54.915 --> 10:55.959
last Christmas.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.787
That's lovely. Mm.

10:57.918 --> 10:58.919
Take a look at the corner.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.311
Looks like someone

11:00.442 --> 11:01.748
wiped at the blood.

11:01.878 --> 11:02.574
Killer was trying
to clean up.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.620
<i>With...</i>

11:04.751 --> 11:06.361
<i>that napkin.</i>

11:08.929 --> 11:09.886
There's some sort
of dust on it.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.932
He might have handled it
with his bare hand.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.064
There could be DNA there,
and on the painting.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.823
Well, the blood on the painting
is all Mikel's.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.825
And some epithelial DNA
from Anton.

11:35.956 --> 11:39.524
Ugh, just that and some
common microbial DNA.

11:39.655 --> 11:43.441
Micrococcus, staphylococcus
and <i>pseudomonas stutzeri.</i>

11:43.572 --> 11:44.791
I mean, I don't see
much of that.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.488
I don't think
I've even heard of it.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.620
It's a bacteria that was
first isolated

11:48.751 --> 11:50.013
from human spinal fluid.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.449
Our boy Mikel was shot
through the brainstem,

11:51.580 --> 11:53.451
and his spinal fluid
probably splashed the canvas.

11:53.582 --> 11:56.280
<i>P. stutzeri's</i> also found
in soil, canal water,

11:56.411 --> 11:58.239
cordgrass rhizome.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.196
Beau, how long
have you been here?

11:59.327 --> 12:01.198
Um, a while.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.896
Been testing the napkin.
All I found is

12:03.026 --> 12:04.419
Mikel's DNA, unfortunately.

12:04.549 --> 12:07.814
But now I'm gonna test
the dust on it.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.559
You a cigar man?

12:14.690 --> 12:16.910
Uh, I've had two puffs
my whole life.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.999
When my daughter
was born, and then

12:19.129 --> 12:20.261
when my other
daughter was born.

12:20.391 --> 12:23.177
How sweet and old-timey of you.

12:23.307 --> 12:26.354
Our, uh, killer's a cigar man.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.443
You ran the ash that Folsom
found on top of the blood?

12:28.573 --> 12:30.445
Tobacco takes up trace metal
from the soil where it grows.

12:30.575 --> 12:33.274
I ran the concentration results
against a brand database,

12:33.404 --> 12:35.929
and, bing, bong, bing,
I got a hit.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.845
Villa Clara Cigarillos.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.238
I think our killer is
partial to tiny Cuban cigars.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.240
Pretty popular brand, right?

12:43.371 --> 12:47.201
I think my only two puffs
were on a Villa Clara.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.812
Let me take a turn
with this baby, huh?

12:51.727 --> 12:53.642
We struck gold.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.905
Tell me.
No, literally.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.516
The-the dust on the napkin
is flecked with gold.

12:58.647 --> 13:01.693
Okay, but Anton was
a counterfeiter.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.218
He probably used gold leaf

13:04.348 --> 13:06.742
- in his nicer fakes, yeah?
- Possibly.

13:06.873 --> 13:10.398
But this dust contains traces
of quartz silica and alunite.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.529
This-this is ore.

13:11.660 --> 13:16.056
So the killer
and/or his napkin

13:16.186 --> 13:17.927
was hanging out
near a gold mine?

13:20.364 --> 13:22.932
That's a lot of gold
in them thar hills.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.460
This is all they sent up
from the morgue?

13:29.591 --> 13:30.897
Mikel didn't have
- a phone on him?
- Yeah, he did.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.986
I gave it to Chris.
Uh, he's gonna get into it

13:33.116 --> 13:35.075
along with
the 50 burner phones

13:35.205 --> 13:36.641
his nephew had.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.905
Man even had fake phones.

13:39.035 --> 13:42.386
Looks like they had some
funky locks in Belarus, huh?

13:46.521 --> 13:50.264
It's like I can feel
Grace's killer

13:50.394 --> 13:53.920
getting farther away
every second.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.052
We're gonna solve this, okay?

13:56.183 --> 13:58.794
I just keep thinking
about time.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.101
All the time that Jen Huang

14:01.231 --> 14:03.059
won't get back with
her daughter.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.583
All the time that
I've lost with mine.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.759
She's been texting you back, right?

14:07.890 --> 14:10.371
Yeah, sometimes.

14:10.501 --> 14:13.504
I don't know, Max.
When this is over,

14:13.635 --> 14:16.594
one way or another,
and my work at CSI is done,

14:16.725 --> 14:19.206
I just have to make
the most of my time

14:19.336 --> 14:21.904
and make things right
with Lindsey.

14:24.167 --> 14:27.170
- Rick Aziz.
- Who's that?

14:27.301 --> 14:29.172
Rick is the COO
of the Eclipse.

14:29.303 --> 14:32.219
One of the board members
who got me kicked out

14:32.349 --> 14:33.568
when I started looking
for Grace.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.353
And his card's in the
wallet of a dead man. Huh.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.660
Did you know Nevada
is responsible for 76%

14:38.790 --> 14:39.791
of U.S. gold production?

14:39.922 --> 14:41.706
Over 30 active mines.

14:41.837 --> 14:45.319
Uh, uh, the killer used
a Chet's Gas Goods napkin

14:45.449 --> 14:46.537
to wipe blood off of
one of the forgeries.

14:46.668 --> 14:47.887
It had gold on it.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.802
Turns out that's not
that rare, but Chet's Gas,

14:50.933 --> 14:52.848
that's the real rare element.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.502
Okay, so I'm not following you.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.025
Chet's Gas used to be
a pretty good-sized chain.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.940
But now they're failing.

14:58.071 --> 14:59.289
And there's only one location

14:59.420 --> 15:01.204
that shares an exit
with a gold mine.

15:01.335 --> 15:04.120
So you think
the killer went there

15:04.251 --> 15:05.034
before he paid
Mikel a visit.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.123
- Yep.
- It's the best lead we have.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.212
If the killer was there,
I'm going, too.

15:17.481 --> 15:20.484
Whoa. Beau was wrong.
Chet's Gas ain't just

15:20.615 --> 15:22.182
doing poorly,
it's abandoned.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.836
So much for
surveillance footage.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.361
Well...

15:27.491 --> 15:30.277
the napkin must have come
from the mini mart.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.496
I'll start dusting
the door.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.237
I'll check for tracks.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.506
Hey, Folsom.

15:42.637 --> 15:45.509
I think Mikel's
been here.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.556
Really?
How do you know?

15:48.686 --> 15:50.906
The lock.
It's the same brand

15:51.037 --> 15:54.040
as the key we found
in Mikel's pocket.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.609
So Mikel's killer
used the napkin

15:58.740 --> 16:00.742
to wipe the blood
off the painting.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.526
But the killer didn't bring
the napkin into Anton's house.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.180
Mikel did.

16:07.618 --> 16:12.188
We've been tracking Mikel,
not his killer.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.885
Right after Mikel
ghosted me,

16:14.016 --> 16:16.192
he came here.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.546
Oh!

17:29.222 --> 17:32.399
Hey. What you got?

17:33.400 --> 17:36.142
This little guy
kept her company, I think.

17:36.272 --> 17:37.534
Oh, it's a cochineal.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.623
All over the desert.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.669
They keep my prickly pears
company, too.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.671
Almost ruined
my landscaping last year.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.764
I still can't explain
this shard of tortoiseshell

17:49.894 --> 17:50.765
we found in the desert.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.332
I thought maybe Grace had

17:52.462 --> 17:54.986
a hair clip or glasses or...

17:55.117 --> 17:57.554
You know, if Grace didn't
bring that to her grave,

17:57.685 --> 17:58.773
then maybe her killer did.

17:58.903 --> 18:01.297
Whoever that is.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.777
Yeah. You know,
I've been thinking.

18:02.907 --> 18:05.301
So Mikel said that
he knew where Grace was.

18:05.432 --> 18:09.088
He did not say that he had
a key to her crypt.

18:09.218 --> 18:10.567
Mikel didn't kill her.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.701
I think her killers were
spooked by my investigation,

18:13.831 --> 18:16.312
and asked Mikel to help move
her body from the desert.

18:16.443 --> 18:19.054
They were probably hoping that
he'd disappear her permanently.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.188
But he kept her as leverage.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.755
Must have gone back to
check she was still there.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.194
Okay.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.806
Maybe Grace can tell us

18:31.936 --> 18:35.984
who did this to her.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.206
Steady, Sonya.

18:40.336 --> 18:41.816
Gotcha.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.907
Looks like a .41 magnum.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.866
We pulled the same caliber
out of Anton Koslov.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.520
And out of one
of his paintings.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.087
Same shooter?

18:52.218 --> 18:53.828
Let's hope
ballistics can tell us.

18:53.958 --> 18:54.829
This is in rough shape.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.091
She was shot twice.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.573
I wish I had
a cleaner bullet for you,

18:59.703 --> 19:02.445
but the second one exited...

19:02.576 --> 19:04.447
Wait, there's something
in her esophagus.

19:04.578 --> 19:07.581
What is this?

19:13.804 --> 19:15.893
Is that
a piece of paper?

19:20.594 --> 19:23.162
Grace swallowed this
before she died.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.642
- It's notebook paper.
- She left us a clue.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.778
<i>She was a brave girl.</i>

19:30.908 --> 19:34.477
Yeah. Adipocere's
a beast to clean.

19:34.608 --> 19:35.652
Yep.

19:35.783 --> 19:38.307
Drying it out is
our best shot

19:38.438 --> 19:40.309
at separating
the congealed layers

19:40.440 --> 19:42.355
without destroying the paper.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.313
Then there's the matter
of reviving the faded ink.

19:44.444 --> 19:45.749
There's this technique
that I read about

19:45.880 --> 19:48.012
used to read water-damaged
documents from shipwrecks.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.318
I mean, I-I don't know
if it's gonna work.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.667
It has to.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.495
This poor girl knew
she was gonna die,

19:52.626 --> 19:55.063
and she was smart enough
to leave us a clue.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.853
We can't let it go to waste.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.469
These must be the burners

20:09.599 --> 20:11.079
from Anton's stash house.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.212
I haven't seen
this many flip phones

20:13.342 --> 20:14.822
since Year 8.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.606
Well, I finally got a match.

20:16.737 --> 20:19.609
Mikel's prints are
all over this one.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.959
And I bet he wasn't
just playing Snake.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.787
I've got a match, too.

20:23.918 --> 20:26.268
Grace's bullet was almost
too corroded to compare,

20:26.399 --> 20:28.052
but the striations are identical

20:28.183 --> 20:29.706
to the ones on
the stash house bullet.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.795
So Grace and the Koslovs
were shot with the same gun?

20:31.926 --> 20:34.668
Mm. Question is,
who was the shooter?

20:34.798 --> 20:37.323
No hits in NIBIN yet.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.977
I might have someone
we can ask.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.457
Ten calls with this number

20:41.588 --> 20:43.024
in the days leading up
to Mikel's death.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.375
An Eclipse extension.
Rick Aziz.

20:51.989 --> 20:54.557
Yes, I talked to
Mikel Koslov plenty.

20:54.688 --> 20:57.168
You know how important
those Eastern European whales

20:57.299 --> 20:58.474
are to this casino, Catherine.

20:58.605 --> 20:59.693
I have to make
myself available.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.348
Well, a 3:00 a.m. call
the day Mikel died,

21:02.478 --> 21:04.524
I'd say that's more
than available, Mr. Aziz.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.308
It's a tad suspicious, no?

21:06.439 --> 21:08.049
Is that how you knew
where to find him?

21:08.179 --> 21:09.572
Oh, come on. Seriously?

21:09.703 --> 21:12.358
I see that you're still
a cigar smoker.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.229
Do you mind if I take a look... I'd rather you not.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.796
You own a registered handgun.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.885
- Do you have it on you?
- Do you have a warrant?

21:18.015 --> 21:20.191
Or a point, for that matter?

21:20.322 --> 21:21.671
Yes, the point is
we think you're involved

21:21.802 --> 21:22.759
with Grace Huang's murder.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.370
I had nothing to do with that.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.546
I have no idea what happened.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.462
Frank said you wanted
to see me.

21:29.592 --> 21:30.680
Is this a bad time?
No.

21:30.811 --> 21:31.942
This is the perfect time, Jodi.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.731
Great.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.909
You want to know why Mikel
was calling me so much?

21:42.039 --> 21:43.345
He was angry.

21:43.476 --> 21:45.739
Someone from the
Eclipse told you

21:45.869 --> 21:47.784
his whereabouts
in Belarus.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.439
An egregious violation
of client privacy.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.094
And when I find out
who divulged that information,

21:53.224 --> 21:54.835
they will be fired.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.578
You know what,
we're not here

21:58.708 --> 22:01.494
to talk about privacy
protocols, we're here

22:01.624 --> 22:03.191
to talk about... No. No, no, no, no.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.020
We are done talking about
anything at all, actually.

22:06.150 --> 22:09.066
Frank, would you be so kind
as to show these ladies out?

22:09.197 --> 22:10.938
And if you have any more
questions for me,

22:11.068 --> 22:12.983
you can speak to
our attorneys.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.856
Thank you so much
for coming by.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.758
It hasn't been
a great day.

22:48.889 --> 22:51.021
Mr. Finado might have
cost a friend her job,

22:51.152 --> 22:53.937
so tell me
you've got something good.

22:54.068 --> 22:56.157
Uh, well, infrared luminescence
didn't revive much

22:56.287 --> 22:57.811
from the note itself.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.987
But ESDA did uncover
indentations from

23:00.117 --> 23:02.424
Grace's writing on the page
<i>above</i> our piece of paper.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.644
Okay.
Drumroll, please.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.995
I think I found most
of the phone number.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.084
This is my phone number,
my landline.

23:10.214 --> 23:14.001
I gave it to Grace the day
before she went missing. I...

23:14.131 --> 23:18.005
Are you sure infrared
luminescence didn't pan out?

23:18.135 --> 23:19.441
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.878
Look. It's just a bunch
of squiggles.

23:32.846 --> 23:35.109
I'll be...

23:35.239 --> 23:38.068
It's a drawing.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.855
Call Folsom and Allie.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.253
What's going on?

23:49.384 --> 23:50.603
We already processed
every inch.

23:50.733 --> 23:51.952
Grace drew this painting
in her notebook.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.432
Then, right
before she died,

23:53.562 --> 23:54.824
she ripped it out
and she swallowed it.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.522
The original <i>Lilies in a Jug</i>

23:56.652 --> 23:58.219
is hanging at the Eclipse.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.047
What did Grace know?

24:00.177 --> 24:01.527
Okay, well, it was the first
painting at the scene

24:01.657 --> 24:03.224
that the killer
started to clean.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.747
Yeah. What's it all
supposed to mean?

24:04.878 --> 24:06.619
I mean, what is she
trying to tell us?

24:06.749 --> 24:08.011
Maybe the real one's
about to be stolen

24:08.142 --> 24:10.274
and this replica's supposed
to hang in its place.

24:10.405 --> 24:12.189
So, you processed this.
What did you find?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.626
Mikel's DNA, Anton's DNA.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.802
A bunch of common
household bacteria.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.978
And you removed the frame?

24:18.108 --> 24:20.459
Yeah, we...

24:20.589 --> 24:22.286
We checked everywhere.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.550
Hand me that magnifier.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.771
Doesn't it look like
the painting is faded

24:28.902 --> 24:31.382
everywhere except where
the frame had been?

24:31.513 --> 24:34.690
I mean,
how would Anton's replica

24:34.821 --> 24:37.214
fade so quickly?

24:37.345 --> 24:38.520
I think I know.

24:38.651 --> 24:41.131
Not all the bacteria
we found was common.

24:41.262 --> 24:44.352
That bacterial DNA on the
canvas, <i>pseudomonas stutzeri.</i>

24:44.483 --> 24:45.527
Yeah, from Mikel's spinal...

24:45.658 --> 24:47.486
Yeah, but what if
it's not that?

24:47.616 --> 24:49.226
<i>P. stutzeri</i> is found
in other places, too.

24:49.357 --> 24:50.706
Soil, canal water...

24:50.837 --> 24:52.360
And fine art.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.797
<i>"P. stutzeri</i> is also used
to bio-clean

24:54.928 --> 24:58.366
very expensive,
very old pieces of art."

24:58.497 --> 25:02.588
Okay, this isn't a replica.

25:02.718 --> 25:06.722
<i>Lilies in a Jug</i> isn't about
to be stolen from the Eclipse.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.202
It already was.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.772
We've been swabbing all over
a real Van Gogh.

25:26.655 --> 25:29.832
You think <i>Lilies in a Jug</i>
is a forgery? That's impossible.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.269
This is the most secure
gallery in Vegas.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.749
I make sure of that.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.229
I think the FBI's gonna be
the judge of that.

25:35.359 --> 25:37.057
They're sending a pro
to run some tests on <i>Lilies.</i>

25:37.187 --> 25:39.494
This one and the one covered
in Mikel Koslov's blood.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.931
In fact, all this art is
gonna have to be shipped

25:42.062 --> 25:44.238
- to Quantico for analysis.
- The Feds?

25:44.368 --> 25:46.196
Catherine, I know you're not
on the Eclipse board anymore...

25:46.327 --> 25:47.763
Thanks to you.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.678
But you are still
a shareholder.

25:49.809 --> 25:52.333
Can we-- Can we just stop and
think about the optics here?

25:52.463 --> 25:55.554
The federal government
investigating our casino?

25:55.684 --> 25:57.338
Our bottom line will...

25:57.468 --> 25:58.339
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that before

25:58.469 --> 25:59.514
you helped Mikel
and his pals to run

25:59.645 --> 26:01.124
whatever scheme you got

26:01.255 --> 26:03.126
going on here... Hold, hold on--
Hold on a second.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.781
You think that I'm involved
in some forgery conspiracy,

26:05.912 --> 26:07.478
or whatever you think this is?

26:07.609 --> 26:10.177
Three people are dead,
including your whale Mikel,

26:10.307 --> 26:11.918
and your employee
Grace Huang.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.833
She got shot right after
swallowing a sketch

26:13.963 --> 26:15.051
of that same forged painting.

26:15.182 --> 26:18.620
So... you tell me, Rick.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.846
Your boss isn't giving me
any answers, Frank.

26:28.108 --> 26:30.371
Maybe your cameras can.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.160
Okay, we need to see
every entrance

26:37.291 --> 26:39.032
that Mikel could have used
to swap the paintings.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.817
Wait, wait.
- What's that?
- Utility room

26:41.948 --> 26:43.123
I checked against
casino blueprints.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.385
No camera, no footage. No...

26:44.515 --> 26:46.343
Hey, look at this.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.432
When Catherine got
the video files

26:48.563 --> 26:49.520
from the day that Grace
disappeared... ROBY: Mm-hmm.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.131
...we didn't get this angle.

26:51.261 --> 26:52.959
We need to see all the footage
from September 12.

26:54.961 --> 26:57.267
Let's look at that
parking lot angle.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.747
I thought it was strange
that there was

26:58.878 --> 27:00.357
no camera covering
that area.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.490
Hey, Chris, camera 104

27:02.621 --> 27:03.709
in full screen, please.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.887
It was deleted.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.063
Someone didn't want us
to see Grace

27:10.193 --> 27:12.892
getting into the SUV,
or who was driving it.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.373
Wait, look at this.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.724
This was eight minutes
before Grace was taken.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.160
That's Frank.

27:20.290 --> 27:21.857
He's head of security
at the Eclipse.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.250
What is he smoking?

27:23.380 --> 27:26.122
My money says
it's a Villa Clara.

27:26.253 --> 27:27.863
Mm. And my money says
that gun is loaded

27:27.994 --> 27:29.343
with .41 mag.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.999
I can't believe
I am working with

27:33.129 --> 27:34.783
<i>the</i> Dr. Phyllis Dupont.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.524
I love my job.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.873
Can't say I've ever met
anyone so excited

27:38.004 --> 27:39.440
to work with a Van Gogh scholar.

27:39.570 --> 27:40.920
Ma'am, you're like
the queen of Quantico.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.443
I mean, there are books
about the work

27:42.573 --> 27:44.010
you've done with the FBI.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.273
I read about a museum heist
in Cleveland.

27:46.403 --> 27:48.579
The way that you used
military-grade infrared

27:48.710 --> 27:50.886
to detect the original
sketches under paint...

27:51.017 --> 27:52.279
It's genius.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.369
Brought a little shortwave
infrared for this, too.

27:55.499 --> 27:57.327
So let's see what we have here.

28:11.559 --> 28:14.214
There's no question
it's real.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.607
It makes me sick.
A masterpiece desecrated

28:16.738 --> 28:18.261
by blood and viscera.

28:18.392 --> 28:21.612
Cleanup will be...
a challenge.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.703
But what you're saying is
the <i>Lilies in a Jug</i>

28:24.833 --> 28:26.269
from the Eclipse...

28:26.400 --> 28:29.272
A forgery...
in the original frame.

28:29.403 --> 28:32.449
Did you find any tortoiseshell
in the frame?

28:32.580 --> 28:35.365
Many turn-of-the-century frames
were inlaid with tortoise shell,

28:35.496 --> 28:37.585
but I didn't find any here.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.978
I did, however, find this

28:39.108 --> 28:41.720
polyethylene terephthalate fiber.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.635
Polyester. Van Gogh died
80 years before disco.

28:44.766 --> 28:47.029
So Anton made a mistake.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.205
Yes. But in
every other respect,

28:49.336 --> 28:51.555
Anton Koslov was
simply masterful.

28:51.686 --> 28:55.124
He even made paint
authentic to Van Gogh's time.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.518
Like this cobalt blue.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.999
Mr. Koslov sintered
cobalt oxide

29:00.129 --> 29:03.872
with aluminum oxide
at 1,200 Celsius.

29:04.003 --> 29:05.961
And this red carmine, made from
ground cochineal beetles,

29:06.092 --> 29:08.224
<i>combined with alum
and potassium tartrate,</i>

29:08.355 --> 29:11.445
then boiled, filtered, decanted...

29:11.575 --> 29:14.230
Cochineal beetles?

29:14.361 --> 29:17.146
Grace had a cochineal
on the sole of her shoes.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.148
It wasn't from the desert.

29:19.279 --> 29:22.021
So you think that Grace
stumbled onto

29:22.151 --> 29:23.718
a forgery in progress?

29:23.849 --> 29:25.067
It's why she sketched
the painting.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.982
It's what got her killed.

29:27.113 --> 29:27.983
She caught
onto their scheme.

29:28.114 --> 29:29.724
And what, exactly,
is their scheme?

29:29.855 --> 29:34.250
<i>Lilies in a Jug</i> was purchased
by the Eclipse last year.

29:34.381 --> 29:37.384
Before that, it was owned
by Orsha Limited.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.821
A holding company controlled
by one of Mikel's

29:39.952 --> 29:40.909
drug dealing associates.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.129
So Mikel didn't actually steal

29:43.259 --> 29:44.870
the original Van Gogh.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.178
He already had it, and he sold
a forgery to the Eclipse?

29:49.309 --> 29:51.093
Rick Aziz okayed the sale.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.052
I think he knew
he was buying a forgery.

29:53.182 --> 29:54.488
The subjective pricing of art

29:54.618 --> 29:56.142
makes it perfect
for money laundering.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.274
Casinos are used to getting
dirty money

29:58.405 --> 30:00.102
into circulation all the time.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.322
You add phony art
into the mix?

30:02.452 --> 30:04.150
Money laundering on steroids.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.718
Let's say a Belarusian
gangster makes cash

30:07.849 --> 30:09.372
selling drugs.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.200
That's dirty money that he can't
just deposit in the bank

30:11.331 --> 30:12.636
without a paper trail;
he'll get caught.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.334
He needs clean cash.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.292
<i>The Eclipse wants his business,
so they help him.</i>

30:16.423 --> 30:19.905
<i>They buy a piece of fine art
from him at a huge markup.</i>

30:20.035 --> 30:23.560
<i>They let him gamble the profits
at high-limit tables</i>

30:23.691 --> 30:25.954
<i>and claim his dirty
drug money as winnings.</i>

30:26.085 --> 30:28.478
<i>And our Belarusian gangster
ends his night</i>

30:28.609 --> 30:31.133
<i>with clean money in the bank.</i>

30:31.264 --> 30:32.526
But to make the deal
that much sweeter...

30:32.656 --> 30:34.397
The art sale
goes on the books,

30:34.528 --> 30:37.661
<i>but the art never actually
changes hands.</i>

30:37.792 --> 30:40.186
<i>Rick commissions a forgery
for the Eclipse gallery,</i>

30:40.316 --> 30:42.405
the whale gets to keep
the original,

30:42.536 --> 30:44.799
and Rick gets to keep
a cut of the money.

30:44.930 --> 30:48.063
So Mikel needed a place
to launder his money,

30:48.194 --> 30:49.935
and Rick was happy to help.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.327
This scheme could be much bigger

30:51.458 --> 30:52.938
than just one painting.

30:53.068 --> 30:55.679
I'm going to need to check
every major artwork

30:55.810 --> 30:57.290
the Eclipse has acquired.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.509
It's possible that several
of these whales

30:59.640 --> 31:02.077
have availed themselves
of this... service.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.340
Rick Aziz caters to the whales.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.255
He has influence
over the Eclipse board.

31:06.386 --> 31:09.345
He's pulling all the strings.
Maybe.

31:09.476 --> 31:13.001
But he got somebody else
to pull the trigger.

31:46.295 --> 31:48.384
So I can have my smokes back?

31:48.515 --> 31:50.256
No, Frank, you can't.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.345
Trace metal in those
match the ash

31:52.475 --> 31:54.347
found on top of
Mikel Koslov's blood.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.479
And the bullet that killed him
matches your gun's rifling.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.396
And the bullet that killed
Grace Huang.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.930
Three murders, Frank.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.496
Bet you get the needle.

32:13.627 --> 32:16.325
Unless you tell us who
you were taking orders from.

32:19.198 --> 32:22.723
Who called you
on your smoke break, Frank?

32:22.853 --> 32:25.117
Who told you to take Grace
out to the desert

32:25.247 --> 32:27.728
and murder her?

32:27.858 --> 32:29.730
Was it Rick Aziz?

32:31.819 --> 32:33.777
I want a lawyer.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.998
All our physical evidence
points to Frank,

32:37.129 --> 32:39.131
but he's just a lackey.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.568
But you found the man
that killed Grace.

32:41.698 --> 32:44.005
Do you know what this is
going to mean to her mom?

32:44.136 --> 32:45.398
It's just not enough.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.835
I don't want to leave
CSI like this.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.142
Not when Rick Aziz is
still out there.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.057
Not when there are
still questions.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.061
Rick's gonna answer them himself.

33:01.153 --> 33:04.591
Ma'am, Mr. Aziz is
in a meeting.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.462
Not anymore.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.899
- Jodi.
- Rick fired me, Catherine.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.380
Because I told you
Mikel was in Belarus.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.556
Security was waiting
for me when I came in.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.429
- I can't believe this.
- Jodi, I'm so sorry.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.561
I...

33:18.692 --> 33:20.520
Once this is over, I'll help you
get your job back.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.348
I am not interested
in your help.

33:22.478 --> 33:25.960
You've done so much
for me, for Grace.

33:26.091 --> 33:29.181
I'm going to make this right.
I'm going--

33:31.966 --> 33:34.012
I can't explain this shard
of tortoiseshell

33:34.142 --> 33:36.492
we found in the desert.

33:36.623 --> 33:39.321
You're going to what?

33:41.454 --> 33:43.151
I'm going to finish this.

33:49.549 --> 33:50.811
There's no doubt in my mind
this bit of tortoiseshell

33:50.941 --> 33:53.814
that was in Grace's grave

33:53.944 --> 33:55.468
was from Jodi's compact.

33:55.598 --> 33:56.860
I never considered
the possibility

33:56.991 --> 33:57.948
that she was spinning me.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.602
She kept her enemies closer.

33:59.733 --> 34:00.908
It was never Rick.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.257
<i>Jodi knew Mikel.</i>

34:02.388 --> 34:03.780
<i>Jodi had access to the whales</i>

34:03.911 --> 34:05.086
<i>at the Eclipse.</i>

34:05.217 --> 34:06.044
<i>She was the one</i>

34:06.174 --> 34:07.958
<i>who commissioned the forgeries.</i>

34:08.089 --> 34:09.786
Until Grace saw something.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.658
But you know, a chipped compact
is not gonna be enough.

34:11.788 --> 34:12.963
She'll spin that, too.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.530
She knew they needed
to move the body

34:14.661 --> 34:17.403
because I asked for
the security footage.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.883
She knew that I was onto Mikel

34:20.014 --> 34:22.582
because I told her I was gonna
follow him to Belarus.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.149
You know what she doesn't know?

34:24.279 --> 34:24.714
She doesn't know what
you're gonna do next.

34:24.845 --> 34:26.194
And what's that?

34:26.325 --> 34:27.239
The only reason
why you came back

34:27.369 --> 34:28.544
was to solve this.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.372
Now, I don't know how,
but I'm not gonna bet

34:30.503 --> 34:32.026
against Catherine Willows.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.768
And you don't have
to do it alone.

34:38.337 --> 34:39.207
Are you serious?

34:43.124 --> 34:45.170
Yo, guys.
You have to see this.

34:47.346 --> 34:49.174
Turns out the parking lot angle

34:49.304 --> 34:50.914
wasn't the only one
Frank deleted.

34:51.045 --> 34:53.091
That's the utility room
behind the Van Gogh exhibit.

34:53.221 --> 34:54.048
It doesn't look very deleted.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.180
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.921
Three, two, one.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.706
- Huh.
- Whoa.

34:59.836 --> 35:02.056
That's from the day
Grace disappeared?
Sure is.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.145
Something happened in that room.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.147
Something Jodi wanted Frank
to hide.

35:06.278 --> 35:08.367
Whatever it was,
maybe it's still there.

35:50.278 --> 35:53.194
<i>This red carmine made from
ground cochineal beetles.</i>

36:02.421 --> 36:04.771
Oh, what did you see, Grace?

36:23.006 --> 36:25.618
Tortoiseshell.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.970
I don't understand why
you're doing this Catherine.

36:30.100 --> 36:33.539
You got Frank.
This is already over.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.541
Grace saw you.

36:35.671 --> 36:38.370
I never met
the girl, Catherine.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.545
Did Mikel tell you
where they met?

36:39.675 --> 36:41.068
At poker.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.375
She was serving drinks.

36:43.505 --> 36:44.114
That's probably where
Grace heard him

36:44.245 --> 36:46.160
bragging about
his Van Gogh.

36:46.291 --> 36:47.944
The one she knew
from the Eclipse.

36:48.075 --> 36:50.164
To Mikel, Grace was invisible.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.079
He saw a cocktail waitress,

36:52.210 --> 36:54.734
not my most promising student.

36:54.864 --> 36:58.041
Grace went looking
for answers.

36:58.172 --> 37:00.914
<i>But she didn't expect
to find you.</i>

37:01.044 --> 37:03.438
<i>And you didn't expect her, either.</i>

37:03.569 --> 37:04.657
<i>You improvised.</i>

37:04.787 --> 37:07.703
<i>You hid Anton's forgery.</i>

37:07.834 --> 37:10.880
<i>A synthetic fiber from the drop
cloth snagged the paint.</i>

37:11.011 --> 37:15.755
The anachronism of polyester
on a 130-year-old painting

37:15.885 --> 37:19.106
wasn't Anton's mistake,
it was yours.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.326
<i>You knew Grace had
seen too much...</i>

37:25.330 --> 37:28.115
<i>...so you called Frank.</i>

37:28.246 --> 37:31.901
<i>And you watched
as he buried her.</i>

37:32.032 --> 37:33.381
You're delusional.

37:35.949 --> 37:39.039
When you covered the forgery,

37:39.169 --> 37:42.738
some of Anton's paint
stuck to the drop cloth.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.175
Along with a few of your

37:45.306 --> 37:48.527
epithelial cells; your DNA.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.964
It doesn't matter
what you say anymore.

37:51.094 --> 37:53.880
The evidence says it all.
You're done.

37:55.925 --> 37:59.102
We can't all inherit casinos, Catherine.

37:59.233 --> 38:02.454
So that gives you the right
to kill another woman

38:02.584 --> 38:03.542
struggling to make it?

38:03.672 --> 38:05.239
No matter
how good I was,

38:05.370 --> 38:08.460
I got passed over
again and again.

38:08.590 --> 38:10.897
I had to create
my own opportunities,

38:11.027 --> 38:12.115
just like your father did.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.074
My father got
a lot of things wrong.

38:14.204 --> 38:16.468
But you came out ahead, so...

38:16.598 --> 38:18.644
who cares who else gets
left behind, right?

38:18.774 --> 38:22.038
Grace was trying
to climb the ladder herself.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.563
You think I wanted this?

38:24.693 --> 38:26.695
The Eclipse was making more than
enough money buying art.

38:26.826 --> 38:28.654
The whales were happy
with their returns.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.395
It was all a victimless crime

38:30.525 --> 38:32.440
until she started asking questions.

38:34.703 --> 38:37.663
I want you to remember that
in federal prison.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.492
You're going
to die there

38:40.622 --> 38:43.799
because Grace brought you down.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.412
I just finished
what she started.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.805
Let's go.

38:49.936 --> 38:52.373
Stand for me, please.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.854
Hands behind your back.

39:03.602 --> 39:04.733
Thank you, Max.

39:04.864 --> 39:09.042
Thank you for having me
back in your lab.

39:09.172 --> 39:11.566
For everything.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.049
Are you sure about this?

39:16.179 --> 39:18.399
I think I just need time

39:18.530 --> 39:20.880
to figure out what's next.

39:22.185 --> 39:25.624
The trip with Lindsey, I hope.

39:25.754 --> 39:28.583
And I could go back

39:28.714 --> 39:30.193
to the Eclipse.

39:31.412 --> 39:35.590
I know. Rick has asked me
to return to the board,

39:35.721 --> 39:37.244
show the Feds that
they're cleaning up.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.941
It just seems like
the right thing to do.

39:39.072 --> 39:40.987
Okay, I-I'm not claiming to know
what's best for you.

39:41.117 --> 39:44.643
I just hope you'll keep going
with your forensics program.

39:44.773 --> 39:46.688
Okay?
Yeah.

39:46.819 --> 39:49.299
Maybe.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.214
It is a big, bad world.

39:51.345 --> 39:52.390
Hey, Max...

39:52.520 --> 39:54.435
Oh, sorry.
Just got a call about

39:54.566 --> 39:55.436
a scene south
of Spring Valley.

39:55.567 --> 39:57.569
Will you be gone
when we get back?

39:57.699 --> 40:00.180
I'll still be around.

40:00.310 --> 40:04.663
Us Vegas kids can never
shake this town. You know that.

40:04.793 --> 40:10.016
It's been an honor learning
from you, Ms. Willows.

40:10.146 --> 40:12.932
Thank you.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.674
Your daughter deserved
so much better.

40:15.804 --> 40:17.066
I'm so sorry.

40:17.197 --> 40:20.592
I got Grace her job
at the Eclipse.

40:20.722 --> 40:23.986
I taught her to never
let a mystery lie,

40:24.117 --> 40:26.511
and to always ask questions.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.991
No, you didn't.

40:29.122 --> 40:31.254
My girl was born that way.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.518
Always questions.

40:33.648 --> 40:36.259
About bedtime,
about new foods.

40:36.390 --> 40:38.479
About something
a teacher said.

40:38.610 --> 40:41.787
She'd always look at me and say,
"I have questions.

40:41.917 --> 40:46.095
I have questions.
I have questions."

40:46.226 --> 40:49.359
My daughter Lindsey,
she was always

40:49.490 --> 40:51.884
a very curious little girl, too.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.799
Then you know,

40:53.929 --> 40:56.889
raising a child like that
can be challenging.

40:57.759 --> 41:01.023
As Grace got older,
she started asking

41:01.154 --> 41:03.286
harder questions, and--

41:03.417 --> 41:07.247
Questions other people
were scared to ask.

41:07.377 --> 41:10.119
I think that's why she loved
your forensic program so much.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.948
Finally, answers.

41:13.079 --> 41:14.602
She was a natural.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.169
I wish she could have followed
in your footsteps,

41:16.299 --> 41:18.084
gone further.

41:18.214 --> 41:21.348
You're the only one who
cared enough to ask questions.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.002
To fight for the truth.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.185
Thank you, Catherine.
