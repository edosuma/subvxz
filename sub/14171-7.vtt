WEBVTT

00:09.309 --> 00:10.542
It's our anniversary.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.443
You asked me
what I wanted,

00:11.445 --> 00:13.078
and I said just to
wake up with you.

00:13.080 --> 00:13.979
It's not gonna
happen, is it?

00:13.981 --> 00:16.248
(Elizabeth)
It's gonna happen.

00:17.617 --> 00:18.484
He asked me out on a date.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.120
I was hoping that
we could do something.

00:21.122 --> 00:21.653
Oh.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.688
The only thing
I really want

00:22.690 --> 00:24.857
is to be at home
with my real mom.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.025
That's all I want, too.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.226
So, you are into me.

00:27.228 --> 00:27.893
Max, what's wrong?

00:27.895 --> 00:29.561
You had me scared
out of my mind.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.697
Carter?

00:32.532 --> 00:35.167
Meet me here
tomorrow night.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.735
Tomorrow?

00:56.723 --> 00:59.224
(knocking)

01:05.331 --> 01:07.800
Happy birthday.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.837
My birthday?

01:11.839 --> 01:13.872
Today's my birthday?

01:13.874 --> 01:14.740
It's 6:06 a.m.

01:14.742 --> 01:18.644
You are exactly
17 years old.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.214
What happens now you--

01:22.216 --> 01:24.616
We wait 25 minutes,
then we wake up Taylor.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.885
But until then
she gets to sleep?

01:26.887 --> 01:28.654
'Fraid so.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.456
Even then,
she was smarter than me.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.157
(chuckles)

01:33.226 --> 01:35.727
Do we really have
to do this right now?

01:35.729 --> 01:36.862
It's so early.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.664
I will still be 17
in three hours.

01:38.666 --> 01:43.302
Come on, girls,
let's do this.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.972
(all)
Surprise! Happy birthday!

01:46.974 --> 01:48.607
Happy birthday!

01:48.609 --> 01:50.175
Okay.
So, what would you like?

01:50.177 --> 01:53.812
I've got bagels, I've got fruit,
and I am taking orders for eggs.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.848
Scrambled with
cream cheese, please.

01:55.850 --> 01:57.149
You don't get
to pick first.

01:57.151 --> 01:57.916
It's not your birthday.

01:57.918 --> 02:01.553
Maybe they'd like to open
some presents first.

02:06.092 --> 02:09.228
Um, let us discuss.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.165
Do you get this every year?

02:13.167 --> 02:15.667
No. This is usually
the worst day of the year.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.703
It's the annual reminder
you weren't here.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.805
I've always
dreaded my birthday.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.373
Okay, well,
I can top that.

02:21.375 --> 02:24.409
I didn't even know today
was my birthday.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.847
â™ª There you go

02:28.849 --> 02:31.917
â™ª There you stay

02:31.919 --> 02:33.619
â™ª Keeping low

02:33.621 --> 02:35.754
â™ª Never wanna play

02:35.756 --> 02:38.423
â™ª You've been up
and down, down â™ª

02:38.425 --> 02:40.425
â™ª You've been low, low, low

02:40.427 --> 02:45.531
â™ª Pretending to not
feel alone â™ª

02:45.533 --> 02:50.636
â™ª Pretending
to not feel alone â™ª

02:51.337 --> 02:54.940
So, you've been
celebrating your birthday

02:54.942 --> 02:56.675
on a different day?

02:56.677 --> 03:00.312
Yeah, I just turned 16
like six months ago.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.847
Weird.

03:01.849 --> 03:02.481
What day?

03:02.483 --> 03:06.118
It's no fun in there
without you.

03:07.453 --> 03:08.153
Here they are.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.454
You know what?
The last time you two

03:09.456 --> 03:13.325
celebrated a birthday together
you were three years old.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.259
Oh.

03:14.261 --> 03:15.561
Oh, yeah.

03:15.563 --> 03:19.831
Yeah, and you carried me
around on your shoulders.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.502
You remember that?

03:23.504 --> 03:24.703
Yeah.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.638
Yeah, you said it was

03:26.640 --> 03:28.340
so I could be as high
as a balloon.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.975
Oh, sweetheart,

03:29.977 --> 03:33.912
you make me feel
very special.

03:33.914 --> 03:34.947
Oh.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.949
Well, you were--
Uh, you are.

03:36.951 --> 03:39.184
Buddy, you have to
come over more often.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.986
Yeah, I don't even
remember that.

03:40.988 --> 03:41.820
What about me?

03:41.822 --> 03:43.455
I mean, do you remember
anything about Gammy?

03:43.457 --> 03:46.425
Was I wearing
a plaid dress?

03:46.427 --> 03:47.893
You were.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.194
I-I have a picture of it.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.862
Uh, it's in my wallet.
Where's my wallet?

03:50.864 --> 03:52.664
No, let's--
let's wait on that.

03:52.666 --> 03:53.498
Let's enjoy this moment.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.168
Do you remember the day
they were born?

03:56.170 --> 03:57.703
It was the best day
of my life.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.471
Okay if I eat this
in my room?

03:59.473 --> 04:01.640
I can still see you
holding one in each arm.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.675
"Do as you please, Grant."

04:03.677 --> 04:05.444
You know, after 14 years,

04:05.446 --> 04:08.714
you girls deserve
a birthday party.

04:08.716 --> 04:09.615
(Grandpa)
Sure.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.782
Um, I would love a party.

04:10.784 --> 04:14.253
Yeah, I'll, um--
I'll text my friend Bird.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.954
She'll send out
the bat signal.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.957
Yeah, let's talk about what
you're gonna wear tonight.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.391
Okay.

04:19.393 --> 04:22.294
Well, let's talk about
the most perfect gift,

04:22.296 --> 04:26.064
for the most perfect
birthday presents.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.166
Oh, a Macy's gift card.

04:28.168 --> 04:28.667
Thanks.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.903
Now you can go get yourself
something fabulous for tonight.

04:31.905 --> 04:32.604
Thank you.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.674
That means new,
something without holes in it.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.208
Right.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.910
And, you, slinky, sexy--
it wouldn't kill you.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.812
And some shoes, too.

04:40.814 --> 04:41.647
There's plenty on there.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.349
So, now, let's--
let's eat.
Okay.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.153
Can I talk to you a second?

04:48.155 --> 04:50.589
Sure.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.858
What did I do?

04:52.860 --> 04:53.558
I don't know.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.426
I'm trying to
figure that out.

04:54.428 --> 04:58.964
Your husband has been asking me
all kinds of questions

04:58.966 --> 05:00.899
about some spa package

05:00.901 --> 05:03.268
that I got at
a silent auction that--

05:03.270 --> 05:05.170
Oh, my God,
what did you say?

05:05.172 --> 05:06.271
No, it's fine.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.372
I rolled with it.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.508
You "rolled with it"?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.276
Are you cheating
on David?

05:11.278 --> 05:13.378
Is there somebody else?

05:13.380 --> 05:15.881
Mom, it's very complicated.

05:15.883 --> 05:19.251
Please tell me you're
seeing someone else.

05:19.253 --> 05:20.218
What?

05:20.220 --> 05:23.255
Nothing would make me
happier than if you finally

05:23.257 --> 05:24.823
unloaded this loser.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.591
If you need me
to cover for you,

05:26.593 --> 05:27.659
I'll do it happily.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.361
Just, please,
no more silent auctions.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.564
I cannot have people thinking
I go to silent auctions.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.032
I...

05:34.034 --> 05:36.001
What else is
a mother for?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.570
I'm pretty sure not that.

05:38.572 --> 05:43.475
Okay, I have to get ready
for that birthday party.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.844
Oh, you think you're
doing that birthday party

05:45.846 --> 05:46.812
in those drabby drabs?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.180
No. In fact,
you know what?

05:48.182 --> 05:49.147
I'm getting my credit card,

05:49.149 --> 05:50.182
and you're going shopping
with the girls.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.085
We can pay for
our own clothes, Joan.

05:53.087 --> 05:54.353
Can you?

05:58.057 --> 05:59.858
Hey, hey,
you want a donut?

05:59.860 --> 06:00.859
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.528
Thank you.
They're really good.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.696
Love a good donut.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.899
Mm, so good.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.235
Carter, you want one?

06:24.517 --> 06:26.151
Mom?

06:26.153 --> 06:29.755
Mom, where are you?

06:33.192 --> 06:34.893
Oh, my...

06:34.895 --> 06:37.929
I can't believe
you did this.

06:37.931 --> 06:38.630
Of course.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.500
It's my absolute
favorite day of the year,

06:41.502 --> 06:43.402
the day you made me a mother.

06:43.404 --> 06:47.139
(both laughing)

06:49.342 --> 06:50.675
And we feel so lucky

06:50.677 --> 06:53.812
to have our whole family
under one roof.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.113
Mom's making a toast?

06:55.115 --> 06:55.847
So glad.

06:55.849 --> 06:56.515
There's champagne in it.

06:56.517 --> 07:01.453
Okay, anyway, I just wanted
to say thank you

07:01.455 --> 07:06.858
for making me
a mother and Elizabeth.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.794
For God sake's,
enough already.

07:08.796 --> 07:09.628
She's your mom.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.096
Call her mom.
Mom.

07:11.098 --> 07:11.830
Don't use that tone.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.064
Cheers.
Anyway, let's toast.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.967
(all)
Cheers.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.203
Happy birthday.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.805
Cheers.
Excuse me.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.206
Happy birthday.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.413
(knocking)

07:28.415 --> 07:30.749
Um, just a sec.

07:37.123 --> 07:43.395
You with a hidden suitcase,
that's never a good sign.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.369
(sighs)

07:53.639 --> 07:56.908
I saw my mom.

07:56.910 --> 08:00.712
Around here she's known
as "the kidnapper".

08:05.651 --> 08:08.820
Does this mean
you're leaving?

08:11.390 --> 08:14.292
Going back to her?

08:14.294 --> 08:15.660
Tay...

08:15.662 --> 08:17.662
When?

08:18.865 --> 08:19.931
It better not be today.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.867
I told you I didn't
know about today.

08:21.869 --> 08:22.400
But now you do,

08:22.402 --> 08:26.538
so can you reschedule
devastating your family?

08:26.540 --> 08:28.907
It's not up to me.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.108
Yes, it is.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.643
It's totally up to you.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.745
It's clearly not
up to me or Grant.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.248
Is there anyone whose opinion
matters to you?

08:36.250 --> 08:37.849
You don't think
this is hard for me, too?

08:37.851 --> 08:41.653
It's really hard,
Taylor, okay?

08:41.655 --> 08:42.454
But I can't stay here

08:42.456 --> 08:45.090
and be with my mom
at the same time, okay?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.291
I have to choose.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.125
So, you could do that?

08:47.127 --> 08:49.027
You could spend
today with us,

08:49.029 --> 08:50.529
have us throw you a party,

08:50.531 --> 08:51.429
pose for pictures,

08:51.431 --> 08:54.165
and then let us
wake up tomorrow morning

08:54.167 --> 08:55.500
and relive that nightmare.

08:55.502 --> 08:56.501
I'm sorry.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.703
I don't give a crap
if you're sorry.

08:58.705 --> 09:02.374
Answer the question,
could you do that?

09:02.376 --> 09:03.041
Because if you can,

09:03.043 --> 09:06.378
then-- then you must
really hate us.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.983
(sighs)

09:12.485 --> 09:15.253
Clearly there's
nothing I can say.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.455
Yes, there is.

09:17.457 --> 09:20.458
"I'm staying."

09:22.228 --> 09:24.729
(scoffs)

09:24.731 --> 09:30.735
Everyone always says
it's so great being a twin.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.736
They wouldn't say that

09:31.738 --> 09:34.673
if they had to be
your twin.

09:42.949 --> 09:44.516
(sighs)

09:54.594 --> 09:57.562
Tay, come on.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.931
All right, fine.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.101
But you're missing out
on some really cute dresses.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.639
I think Max would
really like this one.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.146
How are things
with you and Max?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.615
What difference
does it make

10:16.617 --> 10:18.383
since you won't
be here tomorrow?

10:18.385 --> 10:20.185
You guys finding anything
you like?

10:20.187 --> 10:23.054
Um, yeah, tons of stuff.
Yeah, yeah.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.025
Who else knows?

10:28.027 --> 10:31.062
Max.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.664
He met Lori at
the Quick-and-Easy

10:32.666 --> 10:33.531
where he works,

10:33.533 --> 10:37.402
which he was not
happy about.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.770
And this was yesterday?

10:38.772 --> 10:40.005
Mm-hmm.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.873
And he was
texting you?

10:41.875 --> 10:43.508
Yeah, like a hundred times.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.444
Oh, and Crash
was with me,

10:46.446 --> 10:47.245
so he met her as well.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.581
Well, at least
she didn't kidnap you.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.283
I guess that's
an improvement.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.321
Taylor, I don't want you
to hate me.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.690
Stay and I won't hate you.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.726
I can't stay.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.395
And I could walk
right over there

11:03.397 --> 11:05.964
and tell Mom,
and then you'd have to.

11:07.633 --> 11:08.900
What about Grant?

11:08.902 --> 11:10.468
I can't think about Grant.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.271
You guys ready
to try on some stuff?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.774
Should we even bother?

11:17.209 --> 11:18.510
Well, we're here.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.812
Fine.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.620
Guys, let me see.

11:28.622 --> 11:29.754
(Carter)
I'm not ready yet.

11:29.756 --> 11:30.555
(Taylor)
Yeah, me neither.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.224
We cannot leave this store
empty-handed.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.727
I found something
I like.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.829
Good, let's see.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.435
Taylor,
you look beautiful.

11:43.437 --> 11:44.469
I really like it.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.371
You have to wear this
to the party.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.939
Oh, I think I found
my dress!

11:47.941 --> 11:49.874
Great, come out.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.781
(chuckles)

11:57.516 --> 11:58.917
Okay, no contest.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.452
You win.

12:01.253 --> 12:04.989
You both look spectacular.

12:08.327 --> 12:10.261
I want you to have it.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.263
Tay, no, come on.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.499
Yes, it's your last--

12:14.501 --> 12:17.502
Your last what?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.907
It's your last time
I'm ever gonna be

12:22.909 --> 12:24.509
this generous to you.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.812
Okay, you're both
getting the dresses.

12:27.814 --> 12:30.115
No.
Oh, no, come on.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.149
That would be pretty
humiliating.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.284
Way too humiliating.
Come here.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.819
Come here.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.023
What?

12:40.426 --> 12:40.759
Oh.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.961
Last time you had
a birthday party...

12:42.963 --> 12:48.833
...together, you both wore
the same dress.

12:52.905 --> 12:58.877
Tay, be my twin again?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.178
Please?

13:02.982 --> 13:05.250
Okay.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.018
I'm gonna go get dressed.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.056
Can I hold on
to this for a sec?

13:12.058 --> 13:14.659
Yeah, yeah.
I just wanna look at it.

13:14.661 --> 13:17.061
Thanks.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.812
Hey.
Hey.

13:33.814 --> 13:34.612
Chinese for dinner?

13:34.614 --> 13:37.582
Uh, the place with
good scallion pancakes?

13:37.584 --> 13:40.018
Oh, you got it.

13:40.020 --> 13:40.952
Oh, um--

13:40.954 --> 13:43.955
I need a baby picture of me
for school.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.291
They're doing some
section in the yearbook.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.392
Do you have one?

13:47.394 --> 13:48.827
A baby picture?

13:48.829 --> 13:53.631
Oh, honey, don't you remember
when this building flooded

13:53.633 --> 13:55.633
a few years back?

13:55.635 --> 13:56.668
No.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.337
Well, I had all the pictures
in boxes in the basement.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.772
They all got destroyed.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.774
All of them did?

14:03.642 --> 14:04.943
Okay.

14:04.945 --> 14:08.980
I do have one picture,
but it's my only one,

14:08.982 --> 14:11.783
so I would absolutely
have to get it back.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.952
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

14:16.722 --> 14:17.956
Oh.

14:18.824 --> 14:21.759
How have I never
seen this before?

14:21.761 --> 14:23.228
Why is it laminated?

14:23.230 --> 14:26.297
I wanted to protect it,
you know?

14:28.567 --> 14:31.202
(Elizabeth)
Carter?

14:32.638 --> 14:35.773
Uh, just a sec.

14:36.842 --> 14:42.580
I can't remember the last time
I was this happy.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.115
You're a great mom.

14:44.117 --> 14:48.519
It's really nice
to see you happy.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.766
I was just telling her
what a great mom she is.

15:04.603 --> 15:07.338
I don't know
what's gotten into her.

15:09.141 --> 15:10.441
Thanks for showing me this.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.243
Oh, yeah.
Hey, um,

15:12.245 --> 15:15.179
do have any other
baby pictures of me?

15:15.181 --> 15:17.649
Oh, Lord, boxes.
Anytime you wanna see them.

15:17.651 --> 15:22.487
As soon as we get home?

15:22.489 --> 15:23.955
Yeah.

15:23.957 --> 15:27.325
â™ª

15:31.030 --> 15:32.463
(knocking)

15:32.465 --> 15:33.898
Who is it?

15:34.867 --> 15:36.534
Max.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.402
Hey.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.103
Look at these.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.872
Look how cute I was?

15:40.874 --> 15:41.839
Oh.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.509
Oh, yeah.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.244
That's the cutest one.

15:46.879 --> 15:47.512
That's Taylor.

15:47.514 --> 15:51.416
Hey, can we talk about
what happened last night?

15:53.118 --> 15:54.485
Yeah.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.757
What did you decide?

15:59.759 --> 16:02.093
Obviously, I'm going.

16:02.095 --> 16:05.263
Okay, then, this is a very
important conversation,

16:05.265 --> 16:11.035
because I strongly
feel you should not go.

16:11.037 --> 16:11.769
You know what, Max?

16:11.771 --> 16:13.071
That's not
really your decision.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.572
Yeah, I know,
this is up to you.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.808
But I know things that
you don't know,

16:16.810 --> 16:19.944
which I believe would
influence your decision.

16:19.946 --> 16:20.878
Okay, well,
you know what?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.246
You're not gonna change
my decision.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.015
So, if it's something
I wouldn't wanna know,

16:24.017 --> 16:25.616
please just don't
tell me, Max,

16:25.618 --> 16:26.551
if you're truly my friend.

16:26.553 --> 16:29.187
You know what?
That's not fair,

16:29.189 --> 16:30.588
that's a trick sentence.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.357
Carter?

16:32.359 --> 16:35.493
Oh, hi.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.361
Hi.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.162
Listen, we got a situation--

16:38.164 --> 16:39.263
I told her.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.232
You think she should go?

16:41.234 --> 16:42.700
No.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.335
Yeah.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.170
(sighs)

16:48.374 --> 16:50.875
Do you know
I recently saw Lori

16:50.877 --> 16:52.777
right outside of your house?

16:52.779 --> 16:53.144
What?

16:53.146 --> 16:55.480
Max, I just asked you
not to say anything.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.383
(whispering)
I'm not talking to you.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.717
I'm talking to her.

16:59.719 --> 17:04.655
And she was there yesterday
at the Quick-and-Easy.

17:04.657 --> 17:05.757
Yeah, I kinda figured that.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.825
Which is, sorry,
why I couldn't talk to you.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.761
I really wanted to talk--
No, it's fine.

17:09.763 --> 17:10.261
I understand.

17:10.263 --> 17:15.033
I'm just upset that it doesn't
seem to matter what I think.

17:15.035 --> 17:19.103
Yeah, and it should,
'cause you're her sister.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.873
And today's
our birthday.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.509
You would leave
your twin sister

17:24.511 --> 17:26.010
on your birthday?

17:26.012 --> 17:27.779
Oh, I'm sorry,
are you talking to me now?

17:27.781 --> 17:29.914
You said I couldn't
say anything to you

17:29.916 --> 17:32.016
if I'm your friend,
so I didn't.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.351
But I also can't
be your friend

17:33.353 --> 17:34.552
if you're with Lori,

17:34.554 --> 17:37.121
so where does that leave me?

17:38.123 --> 17:39.957
In my room.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.927
Yes.

17:42.929 --> 17:46.230
Your room.

18:01.046 --> 18:04.949
Okay, it's been
half frosted.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.486
Hello.
May I take your coat?

18:14.126 --> 18:15.359
Hey, whoa.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.395
That shirt looks
great on you.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.129
Oh, yeah.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.530
Better than it does on me.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.832
Keep it.

18:21.733 --> 18:22.266
Oh, no, no.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.668
I-I mean I really
do like it, but--

18:23.670 --> 18:26.838
No, seriously,
that shirt is dead to me.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.808
Thank you.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.311
Hello.
May I take your coat?

18:33.313 --> 18:34.979
Yeah, thank you.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.081
Thanks, man.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.722
Really?

18:46.125 --> 18:49.760
Oh! For goodness sakes, Grant.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.864
How hard is it
to hold coats?

18:54.900 --> 18:57.735
Oh! Buddy,
would you please help?

18:58.137 --> 19:01.272
Well, I-I just got
some cheese, honey.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.173
Oh, here, let me.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.709
Oh. So sweet.
Thank you.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.444
Wish all men
could be like you.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.280
Oh, don't let her
fool you.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.550
She tells that to all the guys
when she first meets them.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.619
Go eat your cheese.
Thank you.

19:14.621 --> 19:15.887
I'm Crash, by the way.

19:15.889 --> 19:19.123
Oh, C-- That-oh,
that's a very sexy name.

19:19.125 --> 19:19.891
I can't believe I said that.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.659
I'm Joan,
the girls' grandmother.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.393
Oh, no, you're not.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.096
Yeah. And-- Oh, oh, this is
my daughter, Elizabeth.

19:25.098 --> 19:27.198
Oh, yeah.
It's nice to see you.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.201
Thank you for welcoming me
in your home.

19:32.738 --> 19:33.871
Where should I put this?

19:33.873 --> 19:34.605
Oh, oh, oh, yes.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.207
Uh, in the office
at the end of the hall.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.375
Oh, right.
Thank you.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.610
Yeah, my pleasure.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.245
What a darling young man.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.481
Hey!
Look who's here!

19:43.483 --> 19:45.983
Oh, the girls
are coming down.

19:45.985 --> 19:50.321
Birthday girls!
Gonna get this.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.023
Hi.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.824
Oh, don't they look pretty?

19:53.826 --> 19:56.394
â™ª

19:56.396 --> 19:58.229
Really?
No, Dad.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.864
Get a picture.

20:00.632 --> 20:01.933
All right.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.537
(camera shutter clicks)

20:06.539 --> 20:08.539
Okay, smile.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.575
One more, one more.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.578
(cheering)

20:13.580 --> 20:15.546
Okay, done,
done, done.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.118
Hey.
Come here.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.025
Hey.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.799
So, what'd you decide?

20:34.801 --> 20:38.169
Oh, um...

20:38.171 --> 20:39.904
I think I'm gonna go
with my mom.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.873
That's awesome.

20:42.875 --> 20:43.474
Really?

20:43.476 --> 20:46.010
Okay, you're the first person
who thinks so.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.845
I-I-I wanna come with you.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.447
What?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.182
Yeah.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.617
Crash...

20:52.619 --> 20:55.453
...I'm leaving tonight.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.656
Well, then we better
make plans.

21:02.694 --> 21:05.529
He's a drug dealer,
she's a kidnap victim.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.098
Add a dystopian society,

21:07.100 --> 21:09.233
and that could be
a best-selling Y.A. trilogy.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.370
That's a potentially
huge idea.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.838
Could you
remember that for me?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.506
Uh, yeah, could you
maybe just

21:15.508 --> 21:18.242
remember your own
potentially huge ideas?

21:18.244 --> 21:20.244
Are you busy
doing something else?

21:20.246 --> 21:24.148
Why am I not in a corner,
making out with somebody?

21:24.150 --> 21:25.716
You can make out with me.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.586
Oh, Bird.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.722
Hey, Gabe,
nice to have you here.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.257
Let me take this.
Oh, thank you.

21:33.259 --> 21:34.258
Well, you know this place.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.326
Go and make yourself
at home.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.260
All right,
appreciate it.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.629
All right, Dad.
Have fun.

21:39.898 --> 21:40.631
Hey.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.100
May I take your coat?

21:43.102 --> 21:44.101
Uh, I'm not staying.

21:44.103 --> 21:48.706
I-I just wanted to see you,
make sure we're okay.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.876
Are we okay?

21:51.878 --> 21:53.210
Kyle.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.013
Hey.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.081
Glad you could make it.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.015
You gonna
take his coat?

21:58.017 --> 21:59.417
No, he said
he couldn't stay.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.384
Come on, you gotta stay.
No.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.386
Come on, have a beer,
one beer.

22:02.388 --> 22:04.121
Uh--
Come on.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.189
One beer.

22:05.191 --> 22:09.093
Uh, yeah, okay,
I'll have a beer.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.961
Hi.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.263
Hey.

22:12.265 --> 22:13.230
Hi.

22:13.232 --> 22:14.165
Happy birthday.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.966
Wow. You look amazing.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.769
Thanks.

22:18.771 --> 22:22.840
Hey, man, how come you're not
playing video games with Grant?

22:23.608 --> 22:26.077
'Cause I'm not.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.679
'Cause he's with me.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.183
Really?

22:32.185 --> 22:34.051
When did that happen?

22:35.620 --> 22:36.454
You know, I'm sorry,

22:36.456 --> 22:40.958
I cannot fill out
your questionnaire today.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.226
Right.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.627
Shall we?

22:48.266 --> 22:50.201
<i>Why are we in your closet?</i>

22:50.203 --> 22:51.268
I'm doing a little test.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.470
I wanna see
how long it takes

22:52.472 --> 22:54.171
before someone notices
I'm gone,

22:54.173 --> 22:55.172
then comes looking for me.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.640
<i>So, you left</i>
<i>the birthday party</i>

22:56.642 --> 22:58.175
<i>to come throw yourself</i>
<i>a pity party?</i>

22:58.177 --> 23:02.046
Not to scare you,
but this is my idea of fun.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.250
Cheers.

23:19.131 --> 23:19.630
Hey.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.733
So, this is where
you're hiding.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.769
Hey.

23:35.013 --> 23:37.314
Can I have one of these?

23:37.316 --> 23:40.284
You want
a baby picture of me?

23:40.286 --> 23:42.720
Yeah.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.488
Yeah, you have that
effect on me.

23:44.490 --> 23:47.024
A different person...

23:47.026 --> 23:49.026
...we want different things.

23:49.028 --> 23:52.196
Real things.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.833
You...

23:55.835 --> 23:57.835
...us.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.907
Crash...

24:02.909 --> 24:08.345
...I really want you
to come with us, but...

24:08.347 --> 24:10.981
...I can't see any way
how that's possible.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.550
What're you talking about?

24:12.552 --> 24:13.984
Your mom's been
running all this time.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.152
She's obviously great at it.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.353
No, it just feels wrong.

24:16.355 --> 24:19.290
And it would be really, really
dangerous for you to come.

24:19.292 --> 24:23.961
Wrong and dangerous,
two of my favorite words.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.729
I being serious, Crash.

24:25.731 --> 24:28.165
Okay, so am I.

24:29.601 --> 24:33.537
Look.

24:33.539 --> 24:34.905
You decided to go.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.908
Your life,
your decision, right?

24:37.910 --> 24:39.677
Right.

24:39.679 --> 24:40.911
Same with me.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.947
My life, my decision.

24:42.949 --> 24:46.217
Plus, you're looking at
all the possible bad things.

24:46.219 --> 24:48.586
What about
the actual good things?

24:48.588 --> 24:54.758
You'll be with your mom,
and we'll have each other.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.128
What else do you need?

25:00.765 --> 25:05.469
Nothing, I guess.

25:17.849 --> 25:22.253
â™ª When the pressure's on

25:22.255 --> 25:25.256
â™ª Gone and past

25:25.258 --> 25:29.126
â™ª When the lines first met

25:29.128 --> 25:31.195
â™ª Mark the time

25:31.197 --> 25:35.266
â™ª Listen to the words

25:35.268 --> 25:38.402
â™ª Like to know

25:38.404 --> 25:41.972
â™ª Still here

25:42.974 --> 25:44.942
Hello?
Grant?

25:44.944 --> 25:46.277
Shh. Shh.
Shh.

25:46.279 --> 25:49.613
Grant?

25:49.615 --> 25:52.349
Oh, very nice.

25:52.351 --> 25:55.519
Oh, yeah.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.556
<i>(gunshots)</i>

26:01.893 --> 26:02.893
<i>What's going on?</i>

26:02.895 --> 26:04.295
He's playing my video game.

26:04.297 --> 26:06.096
<i>He's going to screw up</i>
<i>your score.</i>

26:06.098 --> 26:07.565
What am I supposed to do?

26:07.567 --> 26:09.333
<i>Hey, ass wipe!</i>

26:14.573 --> 26:17.641
Did you just call me
an ass wipe?

26:17.643 --> 26:20.511
No, that was my girlfriend.

26:20.513 --> 26:22.012
You have a girlfriend.

26:22.014 --> 26:22.780
Don't sound so shocked.

26:22.782 --> 26:27.618
Of course, everybody's got
a girlfriend.

26:28.920 --> 26:33.123
Well, I'm having a pity party
if you wanna come.

26:34.893 --> 26:38.195
Sure, why not?

26:42.867 --> 26:45.736
Carter, oh, my God!

26:45.738 --> 26:47.671
What?
What's wrong?

26:47.673 --> 26:50.908
What's wrong?
You're leaving.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.677
Bird.

26:54.846 --> 26:56.847
Who told you that?

26:56.849 --> 26:58.415
Crash.
What?

26:58.417 --> 27:00.918
Oh, my God, I told him not
to tell anyone.

27:00.920 --> 27:01.919
Why is he being so stupid?

27:01.921 --> 27:03.854
He didn't.
Just me and Ofe, okay?

27:03.856 --> 27:05.189
Oh, great,
Ofe knows.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.890
Okay, wow.
I can't wait for my face

27:06.892 --> 27:09.560
to show up on some
fun novelty pool.

27:09.562 --> 27:11.462
I want you to stay.

27:11.464 --> 27:15.766
But-- but I know you have
to do what you have to do.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.103
I want you to have this.

27:23.708 --> 27:26.910
Bird, I can't keep this.

27:26.912 --> 27:28.145
It's a friendship bracelet.

27:28.147 --> 27:32.449
No, those are made
of threads, not gold.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.718
And are those diamonds?

27:34.720 --> 27:35.619
(laughs)

27:35.621 --> 27:39.123
Carter, I know we would've
been lifelong friends.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.891
And, eventually,
I would've given you

27:40.893 --> 27:41.792
something like this,

27:41.794 --> 27:43.627
but this is my only chance,

27:43.629 --> 27:48.032
so keep it, please.

27:55.273 --> 27:56.206
I feel stupid now,

27:56.208 --> 27:59.843
'cause I just got you one of
those keychain Bop-It games.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.483
It's been an honor
and a privilege

28:06.485 --> 28:09.319
to be your friend, Carter.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.754
Stop it.

28:10.756 --> 28:14.658
Stop talking about me
in the past tense.

28:17.395 --> 28:18.562
Shoot me, I'm sorry.

28:18.564 --> 28:21.498
I don't know proper
fugitive etiquette.

28:23.101 --> 28:24.435
You sure you
wanna take off?

28:24.437 --> 28:25.669
We're having cake
in a minute?

28:25.671 --> 28:27.237
Thanks,
I gotta get going.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.906
Thanks.
Hot date?

28:28.908 --> 28:30.941
I wish.
Right.

28:30.943 --> 28:35.379
Too bad Elizabeth is
stuck here with her family.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.681
What do you mean?

28:38.383 --> 28:40.718
What do you think I mean?

28:42.654 --> 28:46.056
Hey.
You leaving?

28:46.058 --> 28:47.624
Yes.
Good to see you, Kyle.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.359
All right.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.595
He knows.

28:51.597 --> 28:52.930
What?

28:52.932 --> 28:54.631
He knows.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.401
What do you mean he knows?

28:58.770 --> 28:59.970
(Elizabeth)
Okay, my son's room?

28:59.972 --> 29:01.405
(Kyle)
Your husband knows
that you and I

29:01.407 --> 29:02.106
are having an affair.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.074
What did he say?
What exactly did he say?

29:04.076 --> 29:06.043
I can't remember,
he came out of left field.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.145
He asked me if I had
a hot date, and I said no.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.012
And he said,
"Well, it's too bad

29:09.014 --> 29:11.115
that Elizabeth is stuck here
with her family."

29:11.117 --> 29:11.815
It's not like he said,

29:11.817 --> 29:13.617
"Kyle, I know you're
sleeping with my wife."

29:13.619 --> 29:15.352
Trust me, Liz,
he knows.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.854
Can we--

29:21.793 --> 29:26.396
And now... so do we.

29:27.966 --> 29:29.967
Come here.

29:37.275 --> 29:43.914
â™ª Mad in love for levitation

29:43.916 --> 29:49.253
â™ª Heartbreak coming down

29:49.687 --> 29:54.691
â™ª And it's lucky for me
I don't mind â™ª

29:54.693 --> 29:57.694
â™ª Waiting patient

29:57.696 --> 30:02.332
â™ª Growing the flower
from the ground â™ª

30:02.334 --> 30:07.337
â™ª There's just one thing
that I've been dreaming of â™ª

30:07.339 --> 30:10.007
â™ª The way we did before

30:10.009 --> 30:15.245
â™ª Holding hands like
could say this was the end â™ª

30:16.514 --> 30:23.086
â™ª Is this the end
of life worth living? â™ª

30:23.088 --> 30:30.360
â™ª Is this the end
of heart won't give in? â™ª

30:30.362 --> 30:31.962
â™ª Is this the end?

30:31.964 --> 30:37.201
â™ª I wanna know,
I wanna love â™ª

30:39.270 --> 30:43.774
Don't you have to go?

30:43.776 --> 30:45.642
Not yet.

30:45.644 --> 30:48.745
You gonna wait till
I fall asleep?

30:48.747 --> 30:51.882
Tay...

30:51.884 --> 30:53.350
Sorry.

30:53.352 --> 30:57.621
It was a great birthday,

30:57.623 --> 31:00.958
even if it's the only time
I got to celebrate it.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.532
What was your favorite part?

31:08.534 --> 31:12.269
Macy's, when we both
came out in the same dress,

31:12.271 --> 31:15.105
and you tried to convince me
that it looked better on me.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.373
(chuckles)

31:16.375 --> 31:19.209
And, um, what'd
you wish for

31:19.211 --> 31:21.678
when we blew out the candles?

31:22.547 --> 31:25.682
Not to lose you.

31:25.684 --> 31:32.456
â™ª We could use a little saving

31:32.891 --> 31:38.862
â™ª Maybe you could
forget what I said â™ª

31:38.864 --> 31:43.066
â™ª And just hold me instead

31:44.168 --> 31:44.801
(babies crying)

31:44.803 --> 31:46.703
So, these are all
the new little people

31:46.705 --> 31:48.405
who were born on your birthday.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.140
Aren't they beautiful?

31:50.142 --> 31:52.609
My favorites
are the chubby ones.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.645
I love chubby babies.

31:54.647 --> 31:57.915
Was I a chubby baby?
Oh, you were so chubby.

31:57.917 --> 31:58.348
Yeah?

31:58.350 --> 32:00.050
Did you wrap me up like
a burrito like that?

32:00.052 --> 32:04.788
That's called "swaddling,"
and, no, you hated it.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.392
So, which one you want?

32:08.394 --> 32:09.660
What?

32:09.662 --> 32:10.861
You get to take one home.

32:10.863 --> 32:11.895
That's your
birthday present.

32:11.897 --> 32:13.830
That's what you're always
asking for, right?

32:13.832 --> 32:16.300
Yeah, so,
which one is it gonna be?

32:16.302 --> 32:17.968
A sister or a brother?

32:17.970 --> 32:18.735
Mm.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.470
What about that one
with the funny ears?

32:20.472 --> 32:22.272
His parents probably don't
want him anyway.

32:22.274 --> 32:25.309
Mom, don't say that,
that's horrible.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.243
Or this one.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.444
Look at her name.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.278
Agatha.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.547
Oh, we give her
a new name,

32:30.549 --> 32:34.651
and she will have
a whole different life.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.387
No, I know who I want.

32:37.389 --> 32:38.855
The twins.

32:38.857 --> 32:41.091
Wouldn't that be
great to be a twin?

32:44.162 --> 32:48.198
So, when did you think
your birthday was?

32:48.200 --> 32:51.234
Um, May 5th.

32:51.236 --> 32:54.805
May 5th?

32:54.807 --> 32:57.040
What? What's wrong
with May 5th?

32:57.042 --> 33:00.477
Did you ever read Dad's book,
"Losing Lyndon"?

33:00.479 --> 33:01.578
No.

33:01.580 --> 33:05.682
Or any article at all
about your kidnapping?

33:05.684 --> 33:06.583
No.

33:06.585 --> 33:07.517
Look, I know I was kidnapped.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.486
I don't need to read about
the search parties

33:09.488 --> 33:10.387
or how they dredged the lake

33:10.389 --> 33:12.823
and how scary
and awful it all was.

33:12.825 --> 33:13.824
You know how I told you

33:13.826 --> 33:16.460
my birthday was the worst day
of the year?

33:16.462 --> 33:18.628
Actually, it was
the second worst.

33:18.630 --> 33:22.432
The worst day was May 5th.

33:22.434 --> 33:27.070
Carter, you haven't been
celebrating your birthday.

33:27.072 --> 33:30.707
I've been celebrating the day
I was abducted.

33:37.115 --> 33:38.915
(sighs)

33:46.491 --> 33:48.358
(knocking)

33:48.360 --> 33:51.194
Carter, you startled me.

33:51.196 --> 33:54.031
What are you
still doing up?

34:06.511 --> 34:08.879
I saw my mother.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.954
That's all right,
you can tell me.

34:21.159 --> 34:25.629
And she's waiting for me
to run away with her.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.638
She thinks you're coming.

34:36.207 --> 34:39.443
I told her I would.

34:41.813 --> 34:45.482
But-- but now I...

34:46.584 --> 34:47.651
Now you don't want to?

34:47.653 --> 34:50.887
I don't know what I want.

34:52.523 --> 34:53.590
But...

34:53.592 --> 34:59.930
...I can't make this decision.

35:02.333 --> 35:05.001
Where were you
gonna meet her?

35:12.276 --> 35:15.345
She said it was
good for one call

35:15.347 --> 35:18.048
just in case I hit a snag.

35:19.817 --> 35:22.519
(sighs)

35:22.521 --> 35:24.254
I hit a snag.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.761
But I can't call her
and tell her I'm not coming.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.096
You don't have to.
Yes, I do.

35:33.098 --> 35:35.265
Yes, I do have to call her.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.033
I have to call her.

35:37.869 --> 35:43.073
But she'll be hurt
and upset.

35:44.208 --> 35:45.709
And it might be
the last time

35:45.711 --> 35:47.978
I ever hear her voice,

35:47.980 --> 35:52.782
and I'm scared that
I'm gonna say, "I love you,"

35:52.784 --> 35:58.088
and she's not gonna say,
"I love you more," and...

35:58.090 --> 36:01.391
And I can't,
I just can't.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.058
I can't.

36:02.060 --> 36:06.763
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.632
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

36:08.634 --> 36:09.432
How?

36:09.434 --> 36:10.734
I will take care of it.

36:10.736 --> 36:15.772
I'm your dad,
and I will take care of it.

36:15.774 --> 36:16.473
How?

36:16.475 --> 36:19.309
Well, I can't tell you.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.312
It's the dad code.

36:30.488 --> 36:36.726
Now, listen, you are too tiny
to carry this enormous burden.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.729
Give it to me and trust me
to take care of it.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.298
Can you do that?

36:44.302 --> 36:45.502
Okay.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.504
Hey.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.745
(sighs)

37:04.755 --> 37:06.456
Hey.

37:11.329 --> 37:13.430
Did you have fun
at the party?

37:13.432 --> 37:14.898
No.

37:17.602 --> 37:22.372
Grant, did you
hear something?

37:22.374 --> 37:25.275
Something that upset you?

37:25.277 --> 37:26.743
Yeah.

37:26.745 --> 37:30.347
Well, it's not true, okay?

37:30.349 --> 37:32.015
No, it's not,
I'm not leaving.

37:32.017 --> 37:32.916
I'm not going anywhere.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.918
Whoa, whoa.
You were gonna leave?

37:34.920 --> 37:36.453
Yeah, isn't that
what you heard?

37:36.455 --> 37:37.721
No, I just heard that now.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.422
But you were gonna leave?

37:39.424 --> 37:41.891
No, I'm not,
I'm not leaving.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.561
That's good.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.463
I'm gonna need you.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.698
We're all gonna need you.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.501
Why?

37:55.373 --> 37:56.106
Forget it.

37:56.108 --> 37:59.075
It's probably just
the sugar talking.

38:01.045 --> 38:02.646
Okay.

38:02.648 --> 38:03.880
Night, Armadillo.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.916
Night, Elephant.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.652
And go to bed.

38:08.654 --> 38:11.388
(sighs)

38:13.824 --> 38:16.626
Quite a day.
Yeah, long.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.094
Like the day
they were born.

38:18.096 --> 38:20.430
Yes, that was a long day.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.265
Oh, my God, twin girls.

38:22.267 --> 38:25.702
Who knew life
could be so good?

38:25.704 --> 38:27.237
Little did we know.

38:27.239 --> 38:29.306
I feel like
it could be good again.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.841
Interesting you should
say that.

38:31.843 --> 38:35.111
Uh, why do you say it's
interesting I should say that?

38:35.113 --> 38:39.349
I wanna talk to you about
a conversation I had today.

38:39.351 --> 38:41.318
Uh-huh.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.754
Lori Stevens has returned.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.022
What?

38:46.024 --> 38:49.726
She was planning to take
our daughter away again today.

38:49.728 --> 38:52.095
It's all right,
no, don't worry.

38:52.097 --> 38:52.896
Carter is here.

38:52.898 --> 38:55.265
She had the chance
to go with Lori.

38:55.267 --> 38:56.800
She chose us.

38:57.635 --> 39:01.004
She chose us.

39:02.006 --> 39:02.539
What's this?

39:02.541 --> 39:04.441
It's where she is
right now.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.109
Lori?

39:06.111 --> 39:07.811
Yeah, waiting for Carter.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.846
I was thinking
what a surprise it would be

39:09.848 --> 39:13.783
if you showed up instead.

39:13.785 --> 39:16.486
(whispering)
As much as I wanna
get this woman, David,

39:16.488 --> 39:20.123
I cannot be the person
to arrest Lori.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.324
I promised Carter.

39:21.326 --> 39:23.626
Well, call the precinct.

39:23.628 --> 39:24.227
Notify the FBI.

39:24.229 --> 39:25.795
This might be
the only chance we get.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.732
She chose to stay with us.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.601
Do you know
how big that is?

39:31.603 --> 39:32.902
I'm okay with that.

39:32.904 --> 39:35.739
Are you sure?

39:35.741 --> 39:38.274
Absolutely sure.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.679
In that case...

39:44.014 --> 39:45.081
...shall we call her

39:45.083 --> 39:48.618
and tell her
Carter's not coming?

39:49.620 --> 39:51.988
Can I see this?

39:54.959 --> 39:55.859
So, if I press
this button, I'll--

39:55.861 --> 40:00.697
You'll be talking to the woman
who stole our daughter.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.374
(phone dials)

40:11.609 --> 40:13.276
<i>Carter, Carter,</i>
<i>is that you?</i>

40:13.278 --> 40:14.644
It's Lori, I can't.

40:14.646 --> 40:15.311
<i>Carter?</i>

40:15.313 --> 40:17.247
It's not Carter,
it's her father.

40:17.249 --> 40:19.015
David.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.884
You wanna talk to Carter?

40:20.886 --> 40:23.553
That's obviously
not gonna happen.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.422
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

40:25.424 --> 40:26.790
That's why I have the phone.

40:26.792 --> 40:29.459
She asked me
to say goodbye for her.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.027
Don't underestimate me, David.

40:31.029 --> 40:33.496
<i>You made that mistake</i>
<i>once before.</i>

40:33.498 --> 40:37.133
By the way,
I've notified the police.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.602
They'll be there any minute.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.238
Yeah, well, you never were
a very good liar.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.840
Goodbye, Lori or Janet,

40:43.842 --> 40:48.144
or whatever you're calling
yourself these days.

40:53.517 --> 40:55.285
You were amazing.

40:55.287 --> 40:58.021
Was I?
Yes, yes.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.675
Mom is having sex
with Gabe's dad.

41:18.677 --> 41:20.076
What is it?
What's wrong?

41:20.078 --> 41:20.910
We need to talk.

41:20.912 --> 41:23.580
No, no.
Oh, my God.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.248
It never ends.

41:25.250 --> 41:26.082
The lies.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.718
I hate you,
now get out of my room.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.453
We are falling apart here.

41:30.455 --> 41:34.123
I've decided
I'm getting divorced.
