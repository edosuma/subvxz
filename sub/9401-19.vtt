00:00.787 --> 00:02.695
Previously on "One Tree Hill"... 

00:05.652 --> 00:08.644
If you talk, I can't
pretend you're somebody else.

00:12.203 --> 00:15.675
If I start to become that
guy that nobody likes... 

00:15.721 --> 00:16.546
You won't.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.769
I'm gonna make sure you
stay exactly who you are... 

00:19.073 --> 00:20.832
'Cause that's a person worth protecting.

00:20.837 --> 00:22.686
I know I slept with Alex.

00:22.714 --> 00:23.863
But I like you.

00:23.883 --> 00:24.678
A lot.

00:27.700 --> 00:28.581
Mom?

00:28.595 --> 00:32.502
It's time for you to open
a studio and a gallery.

00:33.351 --> 00:34.573
Are you okay, mom?

00:34.601 --> 00:36.473
No. I'm not.

00:37.265 --> 00:38.664
I have cancer.

00:39.362 --> 00:41.098
I guess I did all right.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.123
You did everything, mom.

00:50.856 --> 00:52.041
What the hell.

00:56.391 --> 00:57.479
Anybody home?

00:58.199 --> 00:59.159
Miss me?

00:59.672 --> 01:03.141
"The ex love of my life and
current bane of my existence

01:03.225 --> 01:06.978
made it very clear to me that they
did the wild thing last night!"

01:07.062 --> 01:09.681
- Have you called last looks for hair and makeup yet?
- No. Why?

01:11.150 --> 01:12.767
Brooke, what the hell happened today?

01:12.818 --> 01:15.770
I thought you fell for Alex. I'm sorry.

01:18.907 --> 01:20.697
Excuse me. Are you Katie Ryan?

01:21.410 --> 01:23.376
I met an agent.

01:24.079 --> 01:26.330
He'll either sign me or marry me.

01:26.415 --> 01:28.533
Either way, this just
might be the first day

01:28.617 --> 01:30.501
of the rest of my life.

01:30.586 --> 01:32.086
I... I can't represent you.

01:32.154 --> 01:33.621
He decided to sign you?

01:33.672 --> 01:35.339
Not yet, but he will.

01:35.407 --> 01:38.209
It turns out... 

01:40.763 --> 01:42.513
I'm his type.

01:54.950 --> 01:56.461
Good morning, boyfriend.

01:58.798 --> 02:00.799
What did I do to deserve this?

02:00.867 --> 02:03.368
It's my big-shot director's last day.

02:03.453 --> 02:05.704
I thought it deserved something special.

02:06.873 --> 02:08.757
On time, on budget.

02:08.824 --> 02:12.827
Well, sort of, give or
take a punched lead actress.

02:14.163 --> 02:16.181
But I think it's gonna be a good film.

02:16.249 --> 02:17.999
Sorry about that.

02:18.051 --> 02:20.669
And for the record, it's
gonna be a great movie.

02:21.453 --> 02:24.106
Great if I don't miss
picking up today's wardrobe.

02:24.173 --> 02:25.891
I got to run.

02:25.975 --> 02:29.861
Do not go long on your
last day, Cecil B. Debaker.

02:29.929 --> 02:33.265
I need my boyfriend on my arm
tonight at Quinn's gallery opening.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.528
You're kind of liking calling
me "boyfriend" again, aren't you?

02:36.163 --> 02:37.286
Yeah.

02:37.353 --> 02:39.488
It has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

02:40.440 --> 02:41.200
Brooke... 

02:42.692 --> 02:44.192
I'm glad we're back.

03:04.843 --> 03:05.611
Good morning.

03:08.618 --> 03:09.601
You okay?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.237
I see Sara sometimes.

03:14.607 --> 03:16.541
I mean, ever since she died,

03:16.609 --> 03:19.728
I, uh, I see her sometimes, and we talk.

03:21.564 --> 03:24.182
I... I'm not crazy, I promise.

03:24.250 --> 03:27.610
It's just lately, since you...

03:29.238 --> 03:31.039
Well, I haven't been seeing her so much.

03:33.626 --> 03:35.544
Is that why no pictures?

03:36.026 --> 03:37.057
Pictures?

03:38.042 --> 03:40.265
You don't have any pictures
of her in your place,

03:40.954 --> 03:42.734
and I don't want it to be because of me.

03:42.802 --> 03:44.436
It's okay to love her,

03:44.995 --> 03:45.887
the memory of her.

03:45.938 --> 03:48.023
It won't diminish us.

03:49.219 --> 03:50.776
And you don't think I'm
weird for seeing her?

03:50.860 --> 03:54.655
All I know is if I could
see my mom right now... 

03:55.114 --> 03:58.233
I would stay up all night talking to her.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.967
Alexander, where are the
changes for today's shooting?

04:05.979 --> 04:07.560
I'm late!

04:08.111 --> 04:09.661
Is it hot in here? It feels hot in here.

04:09.746 --> 04:11.546
No. No.

04:12.960 --> 04:13.591
Mother.

04:15.168 --> 04:17.219
Another button, please.

04:17.286 --> 04:19.774
The slutty-milf look is so not you.

04:20.305 --> 04:23.091
I have to run. I'll see you guys tonight.

04:23.403 --> 04:24.236
See ya.

04:24.544 --> 04:26.928
Oh, this is... she's gonna catch us.

04:26.979 --> 04:28.764
She's definitely going to catch us.

04:28.815 --> 04:31.400
This is gonna end badly.
We... we got to tell her.

04:32.379 --> 04:33.468
Don't you worry about a thing.

04:34.306 --> 04:35.804
Besides, it's more exciting this way.

04:36.346 --> 04:36.886
Now come here.

04:39.642 --> 04:40.992
We have to tell him.

04:41.077 --> 04:42.977
Tell him what? That we kissed?

04:43.029 --> 04:45.480
I mean, I'm not even sure what this is.

04:45.531 --> 04:46.981
Well, it's something.

04:47.033 --> 04:49.534
And now with Skills back,
it's getting uncomfortable.

04:50.604 --> 04:51.653
We need to be honest with him.

04:51.704 --> 04:52.821
We owe him that.

04:52.872 --> 04:54.039
I know.

04:54.123 --> 04:57.159
Skills is a great guy,
but this is complicated.

04:57.226 --> 04:59.111
It is so messed up.

04:59.178 --> 05:00.762
I should talk to him.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.547
No. I need to.

05:03.660 --> 05:04.933
He's my best friend.

05:09.639 --> 05:10.691
Hey.

05:11.107 --> 05:12.774
Someone is so freakin' fired!

05:12.842 --> 05:15.644
I can assure you that we
looked everywhere, Mr. Avery.

05:15.712 --> 05:16.728
Well, look again!

05:16.813 --> 05:18.363
And where is that loser P.A.?

05:18.431 --> 05:19.698
He probably took it.

05:19.782 --> 05:20.866
Hey, what's going on?

05:20.950 --> 05:23.735
Mr. Avery's laptop computer has
gone missing from his trailer.

05:23.820 --> 05:26.855
I'm positive that P.A. Brian
did not steal your computer.

05:26.923 --> 05:28.223
Okay. Thank you.

05:28.291 --> 05:29.908
That's so reassuring.

05:29.992 --> 05:32.127
Look, you stick to doing your job, okay?

05:32.195 --> 05:33.628
Just checking for hairs in the gate

05:33.696 --> 05:36.531
and keeping my trailer stocked
with red vines and lube!

05:36.582 --> 05:38.955
Hey, Christian Bale, calm down, okay?

05:39.515 --> 05:40.919
Look, I'm sorry this happened,

05:40.948 --> 05:42.710
but it's just a computer, okay?

05:42.742 --> 05:44.125
The production will replace it.

05:44.933 --> 05:46.758
Let's just focus on the work, okay?

05:47.143 --> 05:49.445
I don't give a crap about the computer.

05:49.929 --> 05:51.246
It's what's on it.

05:51.988 --> 05:52.981
Here's your wardrobe.

06:06.779 --> 06:08.563
It's gonna be a great last day.

06:12.919 --> 06:14.703
I'm bored.

06:14.754 --> 06:16.772
You can't be bored. You're 7.

06:16.839 --> 06:19.624
Do you have any idea how fun being 7 is?

06:19.709 --> 06:21.409
Besides, I got a cure for that.

06:21.461 --> 06:22.527
What?

06:22.595 --> 06:23.745
Guess who's babysitting you tonight?

06:25.181 --> 06:28.300
Aw, please don't say Junk and Fergie.

06:28.384 --> 06:30.084
No. Me. All right?

06:30.136 --> 06:32.771
We're having a guys' night,
and it's gonna be a blast.

06:32.839 --> 06:33.889
Aw, sweet!

06:35.608 --> 06:36.575
Wait.

06:37.172 --> 06:38.310
What about mom?

06:38.394 --> 06:40.695
Mom is going to aunt
Quinn's art gallery opening,

06:40.763 --> 06:42.881
so she's putting on her
pretty face right now.

06:42.949 --> 06:45.266
Well, her prettier face.

06:56.662 --> 06:57.996
Okay.

06:59.298 --> 07:02.050
One, two... three.

07:13.290 --> 07:14.648
What are you doing? Why did you stop?

07:14.946 --> 07:15.960
It sounds thin.

07:16.857 --> 07:20.337
I think we should... take
another pass at the vocals,

07:20.341 --> 07:21.803
maybe double the chorus.

07:21.842 --> 07:22.843
What do you think?

07:23.396 --> 07:24.427
I think it's great.

07:24.984 --> 07:26.063
Let's keep moving.

07:30.175 --> 07:32.343
I really think it needs the work.

07:32.394 --> 07:37.765
The insecure artist thing is
cute, but seriously, it's great.

07:37.850 --> 07:40.661
I mean, whatever happened to
you protecting me as an artist?

07:42.196 --> 07:44.247
You remember that guy you became
the last time you recorded,

07:44.332 --> 07:45.382
the one you didn't like?

07:45.466 --> 07:46.967
I think he's back.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.637
It's great.

07:50.705 --> 07:52.189
Push play.

08:11.392 --> 08:12.192
Hey. Hey.

08:13.978 --> 08:15.912
Talk about a work of art. You look great.

08:15.997 --> 08:18.115
Thanks.

08:18.199 --> 08:21.034
So, you excited for
tonight? How do you feel?

08:21.085 --> 08:23.587
You know, if there's a feeling
of being half totally excited

08:23.655 --> 08:25.122
and half completely ready to panic,

08:25.189 --> 08:27.457
then that's how I feel.

08:27.542 --> 08:29.009
Oh, don't worry. It's gonna be good.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.011
You're kind of great at the
picture-taking thing, you know.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.261
Thanks.

08:32.330 --> 08:34.181
Well, I'm glad you think so.

08:34.248 --> 08:35.716
I wanted to give this to you.

08:35.767 --> 08:37.583
Oh. What is this?

08:37.652 --> 08:40.020
My way of saying thank you for
being there for me this year.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.188
I couldn't have made it
through without my little sis.

08:52.543 --> 08:53.533
I love it.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.352
I really do.

08:55.420 --> 08:57.571
I just want tonight to go well, you know?

08:57.622 --> 08:58.739
For mom.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.940
Yeah. For mom.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.960
Yeah, well, I didn't
see it coming, either.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.704
I know, but... 

09:10.718 --> 09:13.056
I just think it's the
best move for both of us.

09:13.905 --> 09:15.488
I look forward to hearing back.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.704
Okay. Bye.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.261
- Whoo. Keep your fingers crossed, bro.
- Why?

09:21.312 --> 09:23.764
I just pitched to the company
to let me be the east-coast rep.

09:23.815 --> 09:25.332
If all goes well, I'm home for good.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.601
And if they don't, are you back to L.A.?

09:27.668 --> 09:28.935
No.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.404
Why not? I thought you liked it out there?

09:30.471 --> 09:32.105
I mean, ain't nothin' wrong with Cali.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.640
It ain't no place to meet somebody.

09:34.353 --> 09:35.759
But it did give me some time to think,

09:35.827 --> 09:39.846
and what I came up with was I
missed what I had here with Lauren.

09:39.914 --> 09:41.615
Lauren?

09:41.666 --> 09:43.316
Yep. I'm gonna get her back.

09:44.688 --> 09:46.536
Have you talked to her about it?

09:47.336 --> 09:49.172
Uh, no. But I'm going to.

09:49.785 --> 09:51.675
What if they don't give
you the job out here?

09:52.448 --> 09:53.677
Then I just quit.

09:54.304 --> 09:56.146
You'd really leave your job in L.A.?

09:56.214 --> 09:56.913
I would.

09:57.817 --> 10:01.451
If I recall, somebody quit their
job in Omaha for love, right?

10:02.937 --> 10:06.387
Look, mouth, I had a whole lot
of time to think about this, bro.

10:07.642 --> 10:09.192
I'm just gonna talk to her tonight.

10:11.145 --> 10:12.846
- Hey, man.
- Yeah?

10:12.897 --> 10:13.947
Ain't you gonna wish me luck?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.649
Yeah. Of course.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.043
Good luck.

10:28.329 --> 10:29.427
You ready?

10:29.792 --> 10:30.981
Yeah.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.332
All right.

10:32.383 --> 10:35.318
One... two... 

10:46.347 --> 10:47.964
It's perfect.

10:49.317 --> 10:51.651
Just perfect.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.837
It's gonna be a perfect night.

11:27.048 --> 11:28.642
Can you believe this crowd?

11:32.016 --> 11:33.600
I just hope they like my work.

11:33.635 --> 11:35.183
Relax. They love it.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.542
And besides, you... oh.

11:39.141 --> 11:40.307
You didn't.

11:40.682 --> 11:41.561
Do you love it?

11:41.601 --> 11:43.531
I... don't know.

11:43.562 --> 11:45.230
It's kind of weird, you know,

11:45.314 --> 11:48.066
seeing everyone looking up
at a giant version of me.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.237
Come on. I want to show you something.

11:58.803 --> 11:59.700
What's this?

12:00.212 --> 12:02.797
So, everyone attending tonight
takes their own portrait,

12:02.865 --> 12:04.015
and then the camera feeds it

12:04.083 --> 12:05.483
to the flat screens in the gallery,

12:05.551 --> 12:08.253
so the people tonight are the live art.

12:09.504 --> 12:10.505
That's genius.

12:10.556 --> 12:13.141
Well, then you're the genius,
because I got the idea from you.

12:13.798 --> 12:16.096
The slide show that you made for my mom.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.568
I love you for that.

12:32.942 --> 12:34.568
That's a powerful photograph.

12:35.247 --> 12:37.665
She has a knack for
capturing a dramatic moment.

12:39.902 --> 12:41.736
So... have you talked to him?

12:41.787 --> 12:44.789
Yeah. I mean, no.

12:44.857 --> 12:47.592
Look, I need to talk to
you about that because... 

12:47.676 --> 12:48.843
Hey.

12:48.911 --> 12:50.962
Well, if it isn't my favorite two people.

12:51.046 --> 12:53.209
Hey, mouth, you mind if I steal
my girl away for one second?

13:02.836 --> 13:05.682
Okay, now, I like to start at the bottom

13:05.686 --> 13:07.179
and do the neck first.

13:07.963 --> 13:09.530
So just real slow.

13:10.492 --> 13:11.471
And then when you're done with your neck,

13:11.483 --> 13:13.101
you're just gonna start at your sideburns

13:13.109 --> 13:14.399
and work your way down to your chin.

13:14.401 --> 13:15.718
Seems like a lot of work.

13:15.785 --> 13:17.436
I'm gonna have to do this every day?

13:17.951 --> 13:19.187
If you want to attract girls.

13:19.239 --> 13:20.522
Is this how you got mom?

13:21.791 --> 13:23.158
It took a lot more than a close shave

13:23.209 --> 13:24.326
to get your mom to fall for me.

13:24.752 --> 13:25.744
Really? Why?

13:25.829 --> 13:27.046
Well, when I met your mom,

13:27.130 --> 13:28.414
I wasn't exactly the
nicest guy in the world.

13:28.992 --> 13:29.748
It's true.

13:30.207 --> 13:32.084
I was a bit selfish, and I fought a lot.

13:32.168 --> 13:34.202
But you're not like that now.

13:34.254 --> 13:35.971
Being with your mom
made me a better person.

13:36.039 --> 13:37.706
You know, now that I think of it,

13:37.757 --> 13:39.892
your mom and your uncle Lucas did.

13:39.976 --> 13:42.511
It must have been fun
having a brother growing up.

13:42.579 --> 13:44.813
It's like having a best
friend over all the time.

13:44.881 --> 13:46.048
Yeah.

13:46.433 --> 13:50.436
But remember, uncle Lucas and I weren't
really that close when we were your age.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.988
The important part is we
became more like real brothers

13:53.056 --> 13:54.440
once we got a little bit older.

13:55.144 --> 13:56.787
But you're right.

13:57.771 --> 14:00.212
Having a brother is a lot
like having a best friend.

14:00.730 --> 14:02.581
It helped make me the man I am today.

14:03.067 --> 14:04.826
And I love that guy.

14:07.954 --> 14:09.838
I love you, too, buddy.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.624
So when do I start
shaving, dad? Next year?

14:12.692 --> 14:14.460
Well, if your face is like mine,

14:14.544 --> 14:16.045
probably when you're about 22.

14:22.435 --> 14:23.602
You like?

14:23.670 --> 14:24.970
I love it.

14:25.055 --> 14:27.172
We spent a whole week in that village,

14:27.240 --> 14:29.358
and those girls followed me everywhere.

14:29.426 --> 14:31.193
They were inseparable.

14:36.663 --> 14:38.223
I think you just made your first sale.

14:38.236 --> 14:40.502
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:40.570 --> 14:42.404
I hope she at least
gets a family discount.

14:42.472 --> 14:44.656
The whole Hollywood glam squad.

14:44.741 --> 14:46.658
I'm honored you guys came.

14:46.743 --> 14:48.577
Seriously, Quinn, this is amazing.

14:48.628 --> 14:50.329
Wait. Are you two, uh... 

14:50.413 --> 14:52.831
Back together? Yes.

14:52.916 --> 14:54.967
Oh. Told you.

14:55.051 --> 14:56.585
So, you got any nudes
in this collection or... ?

14:56.636 --> 14:58.971
Whoa. Pay no attention
to Mr. Inappropriate.

14:59.055 --> 15:01.857
Come on, Josh. There must be
a bar around here somewhere.

15:02.297 --> 15:04.810
Julian, please tell me this
movie's gonna be over soon.

15:04.894 --> 15:06.645
Today was, in fact, the last day.

15:06.713 --> 15:08.130
We're officially wrapped!

15:08.181 --> 15:09.848
Well done. That is so major.

15:09.933 --> 15:11.216
Well, thank you.

15:11.284 --> 15:14.253
Speaking of major, look
at you go. Congratulations.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.631
Thank you.

15:30.476 --> 15:32.227
You've been kind of
distant since I got home.

15:34.996 --> 15:37.176
Look, I owe you an apology.

15:37.826 --> 15:39.428
Why? What for?

15:39.495 --> 15:41.430
I came home for you because I love you.

15:41.929 --> 15:44.332
I can't be apart from you,
and I should have never left.

15:44.879 --> 15:45.868
Antwon... 

15:45.935 --> 15:47.519
Please tell me you feel the same way.

15:48.721 --> 15:51.123
It's just, things are different.

15:51.191 --> 15:53.142
I mean, maybe if we'd never split up.

15:53.209 --> 15:55.260
Yeah, but you said you wouldn't
come to L.A., so I fixed it.

15:55.272 --> 15:56.355
I'm home now.

15:57.113 --> 15:58.722
Why can't it just be like it was?

16:01.401 --> 16:03.335
Because it's not like it was.

16:03.923 --> 16:04.843
Is there someone else?

16:05.410 --> 16:06.657
I don't know.

16:07.157 --> 16:08.407
Maybe.

16:11.077 --> 16:13.412
I'm sorry, Antwon.

16:19.636 --> 16:20.986
Oh, baby, that's... 

16:21.054 --> 16:23.228
I said no talking.

16:25.008 --> 16:27.709
So our lead actors are sleeping together.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.377
Here's my surprised face.

16:29.429 --> 16:31.113
Where did you even get this?

16:31.625 --> 16:33.215
It was e-mailed to me this morning.

16:33.266 --> 16:34.349
By who?

16:34.400 --> 16:35.834
By someone smart enough to know

16:35.902 --> 16:37.385
that you'll do just about anything

16:37.437 --> 16:39.321
to protect Alex from
this getting out there.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.273
Julian, we're being blackmailed.

16:55.604 --> 16:57.028
Julian, what's the matter?

16:58.033 --> 16:58.835
This.

17:00.449 --> 17:01.375
Oh, baby, that's... 

17:01.443 --> 17:02.726
I said no talking.

17:03.435 --> 17:04.779
I... I didn't do it.

17:06.406 --> 17:07.005
Oh, that's funny.

17:07.010 --> 17:08.983
That sure looks like
you screwing him to me.

17:09.643 --> 17:11.115
No. I mean, okay, I did sleep with him.

17:11.140 --> 17:12.578
I just... I didn't make that tape.

17:13.550 --> 17:15.078
- Did you get it from Josh?
- No.

17:15.099 --> 17:18.125
I got it from someone who's trying to
blackmail my father for a ton of money.

17:19.296 --> 17:21.208
Alex, why don't you just
shoot me in the head?

17:21.233 --> 17:22.932
It would save us all so much time.

17:23.726 --> 17:24.765
That's not fair.

17:24.778 --> 17:28.585
No. What's not fair is that I keep
trying to find the best version of you,

17:28.637 --> 17:30.931
and you just keep showing
me the worst version.

17:36.569 --> 17:37.649
So what did you say?

17:37.665 --> 17:40.231
I told him I didn't want to
go back to the way it was.

17:40.774 --> 17:42.266
He was really upset.

17:42.317 --> 17:44.618
It was bad. I feel terrible.

17:44.686 --> 17:46.570
I know I should just
take the high road here

17:46.621 --> 17:48.239
and let you find your way back to him,

17:48.306 --> 17:50.791
but... I really like you, Lauren.

17:50.876 --> 17:52.793
It's also my decision.

17:52.861 --> 17:55.663
And I have feelings for you, too.

17:59.301 --> 18:01.435
Do you think Antwon's gonna be okay?

18:08.175 --> 18:10.712
Skills. My man. How you been, buddy?

18:11.033 --> 18:13.297
Thirsty. Four shots.

18:13.365 --> 18:15.349
Four shots. Coming up.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.185
Well, I mean, there must be
something that can be done.

18:20.505 --> 18:21.681
How about an extension?

18:21.709 --> 18:23.713
Check one, two.

18:23.851 --> 18:27.661
Annoying, impatient artist
ready to lay down a track.

18:29.981 --> 18:32.366
So you're telling me
there is nothing I can do?

18:35.965 --> 18:37.252
Well, that's just great.

18:39.674 --> 18:43.388
You know, it only took the Beatles
a month to record "Abbey Road."

18:47.933 --> 18:49.233
Sorry. You... you okay?

18:50.852 --> 18:53.062
The record sounds great, Michael.

18:53.983 --> 18:56.440
But it looks like I'm not
gonna be around to finish it.

18:56.944 --> 18:58.726
I'm going back to england.

19:00.466 --> 19:01.545
Oh, that's funny.

19:01.992 --> 19:05.104
Because when you said that we
were gonna be working together,

19:05.127 --> 19:08.068
I sort of imagined that you'd at
least be in the same hemisphere.

19:08.136 --> 19:09.570
You know what? I'm serious.

19:09.638 --> 19:12.106
Believe me, I have tried moving
heaven and earth to stay here,

19:12.174 --> 19:13.657
but there's a problem with my visa.

19:16.401 --> 19:17.778
I'm being deported.

19:19.748 --> 19:21.698
And where does that leave us?

19:22.659 --> 19:23.923
We're scuppered.

19:24.886 --> 19:26.854
I'm afraid there's not gonna be an "us."

19:33.912 --> 19:36.497
I cannot believe she's
giving him the time of day

19:36.565 --> 19:38.065
after he stood her up.

19:38.149 --> 19:40.325
And besides, it's gross.

19:41.102 --> 19:42.336
What's gross?

19:42.404 --> 19:45.289
The thought of my mother having sex.

19:45.357 --> 19:46.457
Blech!

19:46.525 --> 19:47.975
Yeah, well, I don't think it's gross.

19:48.043 --> 19:49.893
I mean, she's an attractive
older woman, Brooke.

19:49.945 --> 19:51.412
Oh, okay. Stop.

19:51.496 --> 19:54.665
I cannot talk about my
mother and sex with you.

19:54.732 --> 19:57.084
It's nice that you're
being so sweet about her,

19:57.168 --> 19:59.265
but you need to stick to what you know,

19:59.308 --> 20:00.904
which is designing super-hot clothes

20:00.956 --> 20:02.923
and sleeping with skanky actresses.

20:05.010 --> 20:06.176
Thanks.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.181
Hey, check this out. I kind of like it.

20:11.249 --> 20:13.183
You filmed us having sex?

20:14.141 --> 20:15.452
You found my computer?

20:15.520 --> 20:16.770
No. But someone did.

20:16.855 --> 20:18.489
And now Julian and his
father are being blackmailed

20:18.557 --> 20:19.890
for $1 million thanks to you!

20:19.941 --> 20:20.994
What?

20:21.509 --> 20:24.278
How could you? It's my career.

20:24.362 --> 20:26.113
It's Julian's career, and Paul's,

20:26.181 --> 20:27.865
and all the people that
worked so hard on this film.

20:27.932 --> 20:29.300
They put everything they
had into this project,

20:29.367 --> 20:30.985
and now you've just
jeopardized everything.

20:31.069 --> 20:33.737
This is not my fault, okay?
My computer was stolen.

20:34.515 --> 20:35.876
Not your fault?

20:36.812 --> 20:37.476
Okay.

20:39.327 --> 20:40.794
But here's what I don't get... 

20:40.879 --> 20:44.848
why would you make a tape of yourself
having sex when you suck at it?!

20:45.917 --> 20:48.836
At least try to be
professional about this.

22:38.042 --> 22:38.846
This guy?

22:39.288 --> 22:40.784
He's laughing at me.

22:41.809 --> 22:43.867
Why do you say that?

22:44.018 --> 22:45.185
Oh, you ready?

22:45.253 --> 22:47.171
Remember all that stuff
that was on Josh's computer

22:47.238 --> 22:48.922
that he was freaking
out about this morning?

22:49.506 --> 22:50.674
Wait for it.

22:51.617 --> 22:54.128
He and Alex made a sex tape,

22:54.212 --> 22:56.714
and now we're being blackmailed
to keep it under wraps.

22:56.765 --> 22:58.415
Oh-ho, no.

22:58.466 --> 23:00.551
Go ahead. You can laugh at me now, too.

23:01.635 --> 23:02.970
You warned me about Alex.

23:03.054 --> 23:05.522
You told me I shouldn't work with her.

23:05.590 --> 23:06.740
Maybe you were right.

23:07.189 --> 23:08.734
Maybe I should just let her fail.

23:10.358 --> 23:13.430
Hey, the... the tape might even
bring the movie some free publicity.

23:13.498 --> 23:16.650
Hey, whoever said "there's no
such thing as bad publicity"

23:16.718 --> 23:18.152
was never on a sex tape.

23:18.236 --> 23:19.920
Trust me.

23:19.988 --> 23:21.104
You have to help her.

23:23.525 --> 23:26.510
Look, I know you're
disappointed in her right now,

23:26.743 --> 23:28.862
but I bet she didn't do this on purpose.

23:30.465 --> 23:32.850
And I bet that deep down in your heart,

23:32.917 --> 23:34.218
you want to help her.

23:34.670 --> 23:36.003
So do it.

23:36.471 --> 23:37.788
You really mean that?

23:37.856 --> 23:40.600
This is not a test, Julian.

23:40.975 --> 23:44.511
Yes. I think you should help Alex.

23:47.699 --> 23:49.942
So he's not laughing at me, then?

23:51.519 --> 23:53.352
Well, maybe a little.

23:56.808 --> 23:59.409
Chase Adams back behind the bar.

23:59.477 --> 24:01.278
Well, it's only beer, wine, and shots,

24:01.329 --> 24:02.813
so I can't do that much damage.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.199
I'll take a beer.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.918
So, I'm a little jealous

24:07.986 --> 24:09.753
now that you'll be spending
your days and nights

24:09.821 --> 24:10.938
hanging out with some other girl.

24:11.728 --> 24:13.040
What?

24:13.124 --> 24:14.842
Somebody bought your portrait.

24:14.926 --> 24:16.877
She's, um... oh, she's right there.

24:38.386 --> 24:40.215
I am so excited you like his portrait.

24:40.749 --> 24:41.933
I just love it!

24:42.664 --> 24:44.281
And now meeting the subject,

24:44.666 --> 24:46.923
well, that makes it all the more special.

24:48.155 --> 24:49.270
I'm Katie.

24:49.692 --> 24:50.522
Clay.

24:52.715 --> 24:55.026
I don't want to take up all
your time on your special night,

24:55.529 --> 24:58.370
and I want to see the rest of
your work, so please excuse me.

25:05.891 --> 25:06.868
I like her.

25:07.605 --> 25:09.212
And she seems to like your portrait.

25:10.253 --> 25:12.855
I guess I'll just have to get
used to letting you be with her.

25:15.825 --> 25:17.509
Tonight seems to be going well, huh?

25:18.280 --> 25:18.927
Yeah.

25:27.197 --> 25:29.022
Can you, uh, just
excuse me for one second?

25:29.053 --> 25:29.982
Sure.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.264
I'm sorry.

25:36.146 --> 25:37.780
So there's nothing we can do?

25:37.847 --> 25:39.131
Nope.

25:39.199 --> 25:40.928
I have to leave.

25:41.985 --> 25:43.302
And sooner than later.

25:46.122 --> 25:48.841
Well, I guess it's back to my day job.

25:48.908 --> 25:50.626
We'll find someone to
finish the record with you.

25:50.693 --> 25:51.744
I promise.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.595
I don't want anyone else.

25:53.663 --> 25:55.345
And that's both guys talking the musician

25:55.370 --> 25:57.445
and the guy who just needs you.

26:06.245 --> 26:07.375
What are you doing?

26:09.045 --> 26:12.431
Oh, I thought I looked hotter as a blonde.

26:12.515 --> 26:14.133
What do you think?

26:14.893 --> 26:16.509
I told you I couldn't represent you,

26:16.517 --> 26:18.383
and now you show up here uninvited,

26:18.395 --> 26:20.339
texting me inappropriately
about my girlfriend?

26:20.406 --> 26:22.274
I mean, who do you think you are?

26:22.998 --> 26:24.013
Clay... 

26:24.410 --> 26:27.196
I can be whoever you want me to be.

26:27.263 --> 26:28.831
You need to leave.

26:29.282 --> 26:30.199
Now.

26:31.168 --> 26:32.297
I'm sorry.

26:33.561 --> 26:35.854
I felt a connection between the two of us.

26:37.740 --> 26:39.108
I guess... 

26:39.175 --> 26:40.658
I guess I was wrong.

26:53.616 --> 26:54.472
Don't. Don't.

26:55.376 --> 26:57.092
You're not gonna find
any answers in there.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.393
You don't have to do this.

26:58.444 --> 26:59.444
Do what?

26:59.529 --> 27:01.596
Always try to save me.

27:01.648 --> 27:04.566
It seems no matter what I
do, I mess things up for you.

27:04.617 --> 27:07.619
Trust me, I never meant
to hurt you or your father

27:07.687 --> 27:09.454
or the movie that we just made.

27:09.539 --> 27:12.357
But now that the film's over,
I'll just get out of your way.

27:12.425 --> 27:14.476
Do what you want to do with
the tape. I'll understand.

27:14.544 --> 27:16.292
Alex, it's gonna be okay.

27:16.326 --> 27:17.488
We're gonna get through it.

27:17.495 --> 27:18.857
And you're not going anywhere.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.365
We're gonna get through this together.

27:20.433 --> 27:23.502
I'm gonna do everything I can to help you.

27:23.586 --> 27:24.353
I promise.

27:25.820 --> 27:26.686
Really?

27:27.571 --> 27:28.724
Really.

27:32.595 --> 27:34.513
Thank you, Julian.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.348
Don't thank me.

27:37.008 --> 27:38.584
Thank Brooke.

27:44.509 --> 27:47.126
"He turned away to give them
time to pull themselves together;

27:47.149 --> 27:49.528
"and waited, allowing his eyes to rest

27:49.612 --> 27:51.530
on the trim cruiser in the distance."

27:51.614 --> 27:53.282
So the boys were saved?

27:53.333 --> 27:54.700
In the end, yeah.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.019
I like it when you read to me.

27:57.086 --> 27:58.003
So do I.

27:58.477 --> 27:59.922
It was sad when Piggy died.

27:59.989 --> 28:02.107
I know, man. I like Piggy, too.

28:02.821 --> 28:05.761
It's good that the boys had
each other on the island.

28:06.516 --> 28:09.715
It must have been pretty
lonely and scary all alone.

28:10.844 --> 28:12.050
Do you ever get lonely?

28:12.135 --> 28:13.168
Yeah, sometimes.

28:13.236 --> 28:16.471
So do you think you'll be okay when
I go off to training camp this season?

28:16.522 --> 28:18.506
Yeah, I guess.

28:18.558 --> 28:20.559
I like it better when you're home, though.

28:20.643 --> 28:22.895
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure. What?

28:23.997 --> 28:26.281
Well, even though she
doesn't show it all the time,

28:26.349 --> 28:28.884
deep down inside, your
mom is still very sad

28:28.952 --> 28:30.252
that your grandma died.

28:31.576 --> 28:32.537
Yeah.

28:32.622 --> 28:35.857
So when I'm away, I need you
to just watch out for her,

28:35.909 --> 28:37.960
make sure she doesn't get too sad.

28:38.360 --> 28:39.411
Yeah.

28:39.479 --> 28:41.280
I need you to be the man
of the house when I'm gone.

28:41.347 --> 28:43.002
Can you do that for me?

28:43.549 --> 28:44.600
Yeah.

28:44.677 --> 28:47.336
Okay. I knew I could count on you.

28:47.387 --> 28:49.338
Mom's gonna be okay, right?

28:49.389 --> 28:51.056
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

28:52.130 --> 28:55.010
And besides, now we'll
both be taking care of her.

28:56.148 --> 28:56.812
All right?

29:00.650 --> 29:02.884
Hands off, girlie. That one's mine.

29:03.464 --> 29:04.720
How you holding up?

29:04.787 --> 29:06.072
I'm good.

29:06.555 --> 29:07.739
I know it must be hard.

29:07.807 --> 29:09.724
Your mom played a big part in this night.

29:09.776 --> 29:14.012
Yeah, it is, but, you know,
I think Jamie really helps.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.747
It's kind of life's little plan, you know?

29:15.832 --> 29:17.616
You have kids so you have
something to hold onto

29:17.700 --> 29:18.617
when you lose your parents.

29:21.838 --> 29:23.305
What's wrong?

29:25.241 --> 29:27.009
I can't have kids.

29:28.294 --> 29:29.417
What?

29:30.669 --> 29:32.097
Have you seen a specialist or... ?

29:32.181 --> 29:34.261
Yeah, no, I did everything, and... 

29:35.184 --> 29:36.805
kids aren't in the cards for me.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.215
You cannot give up, Brooke.

29:40.720 --> 29:41.754
You never know.

29:45.194 --> 29:46.895
So, what are our options?

29:46.946 --> 29:48.196
It's a tough call.

29:48.611 --> 29:53.235
If we do nothing, it could hurt the
film, but $1 million is a lot of money.

29:53.286 --> 29:55.370
If it helps, I'm willing
to take one for the team.

29:55.438 --> 29:56.538
You can release the tape.

29:56.605 --> 29:57.823
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.994
And if the tape does get out?

30:02.498 --> 30:05.388
We just finished making a
charming independent movie.

30:05.412 --> 30:08.555
For it to work, we need to take
it to a major film festival.

30:08.583 --> 30:12.371
We need people focusing on your
great film, Julian, not a sex tape.

30:12.438 --> 30:14.756
This whole thing could
really hurt our chances.

30:14.807 --> 30:16.675
I have a really good friend
who works at Sundance.

30:16.759 --> 30:17.726
I could... 

30:17.793 --> 30:18.788
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

30:22.765 --> 30:25.545
Whoever's blackmailing us,
they're right about one thing... 

30:26.302 --> 30:27.953
we have everything on the line.

30:28.021 --> 30:30.789
Well, they're also right
about something else.

30:30.857 --> 30:32.307
I want to protect Alex.

30:32.896 --> 30:34.242
She's fragile.

30:34.736 --> 30:36.306
And if this tape gets out... 

30:37.985 --> 30:39.386
It could destroy her.

30:43.819 --> 30:47.781
Well, now it looks like we have
$3 million invested in this film.

30:59.852 --> 31:01.253
Look, we got to tell Brooke, all right?

31:01.320 --> 31:03.722
She's got no idea, and I
don't think us being together

31:03.806 --> 31:04.890
is gonna strike her as a good surprise.

31:04.974 --> 31:06.391
Now is not a good time.

31:06.459 --> 31:08.927
We're on the verge of
releasing a very important line,

31:08.995 --> 31:11.413
and I need her thinking
about business and not us.

31:12.164 --> 31:13.198
Hey... 

31:13.282 --> 31:14.950
You're ashamed of us, aren't you?

31:15.017 --> 31:16.068
Please.

31:16.135 --> 31:17.886
- You are.
- Please!

31:17.954 --> 31:19.905
I am not.

31:19.989 --> 31:22.557
Look, I told Brooke I was taking a lover.

31:23.543 --> 31:26.078
Where's the shame in it
being a young, hot guy

31:26.162 --> 31:28.497
who's 25 years younger than me

31:28.548 --> 31:31.503
who has abs that I can
bounce quarters off of, Hmm?

31:32.301 --> 31:34.269
You just need to relax.

31:34.337 --> 31:36.204
You need to relax.

31:36.255 --> 31:39.040
Nobody's ashamed of anybody, okay?

31:42.328 --> 31:45.313
And then she said there was someone else.

31:45.381 --> 31:47.549
Dude, that sucks.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.851
Yeah, but I just don't know
who that someone else could... 

32:02.782 --> 32:03.865
It's you, isn't it?

32:06.235 --> 32:07.919
Lauren's "someone else."

32:08.004 --> 32:09.671
Skills, I was gonna talk to you... 

32:09.738 --> 32:11.072
so it's true?

32:11.658 --> 32:12.491
Yes, but... 

32:17.964 --> 32:20.682
Thanks for sleeping with
my girlfriend, buddy.

32:26.639 --> 32:29.241
That's just scandalous.

32:29.308 --> 32:32.144
Just simply... 

32:32.228 --> 32:34.312
scandalous.

32:52.417 --> 32:54.508
Your face says "a shot and a beer back,"

32:54.540 --> 32:56.079
but I think this is what you need.

32:57.422 --> 32:58.929
Someone get their heart broken tonight?

32:58.960 --> 32:59.732
Yeah.

33:00.925 --> 33:02.412
It was my fault, though.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.668
I mean, looking back, I had my chance.

33:05.629 --> 33:07.478
I just didn't take it when I should have.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.329
Now it's too late, and
I'll never get her back.

33:10.661 --> 33:13.805
I don't know. Never is a pretty long time.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.830
I should have just told her how I felt.

33:39.806 --> 33:41.606
Well, all things considered,

33:41.629 --> 33:43.317
I thought that went pretty well.

33:43.385 --> 33:44.284
Um, are you kidding?

33:44.297 --> 33:49.617
A fist fight, public sex, and,
um, a check for you? It rocked!

33:49.636 --> 33:52.051
Whoa. What is this for? I can't take this.

33:52.056 --> 33:53.607
Consider it back rent.

33:53.692 --> 33:55.509
And thanks, Hales.

33:55.577 --> 33:57.661
Thanks for being there for me.

33:57.729 --> 33:59.829
That is what sisters are for.

34:02.231 --> 34:04.435
Mom would have loved a night like tonight.

34:05.780 --> 34:06.993
Sometimes I flash on the fact

34:07.028 --> 34:08.170
that we're never gonna see her again,

34:08.197 --> 34:08.918
and, uh... 

34:11.145 --> 34:12.226
I can't breathe.

34:13.603 --> 34:14.811
I just can't believe she's gone.

34:15.844 --> 34:16.893
I know.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.317
We all miss her.

34:23.069 --> 34:26.335
Just know, Haley, she was so proud of you.

34:31.364 --> 34:32.936
I hope you're proud of yourself, mother.

34:32.971 --> 34:36.172
I can't believe that even
you would stoop this low

34:36.184 --> 34:38.574
to sexually harass an employee

34:38.601 --> 34:41.300
to get back at Paul for
standing you up on a date?

34:41.313 --> 34:42.429
Brooke... 

34:45.027 --> 34:46.309
I am the date.

34:46.745 --> 34:48.589
We've been seeing each other.

35:05.713 --> 35:08.115
Huh. How was your night?

35:08.784 --> 35:10.434
The best ever.

35:14.806 --> 35:18.358
I don't know where you get
it, but you're a great parent.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.415
I get it from you.

35:22.249 --> 35:23.363
You know what I was thinking tonight?

35:23.891 --> 35:24.605
What?

35:26.974 --> 35:28.368
I want us to have another baby.

35:31.480 --> 35:32.322
Hales?

35:32.824 --> 35:34.892
I actually took a
pregnancy test this morning.

35:35.898 --> 35:38.274
And it... it was negative.

35:41.314 --> 35:42.194
Okay.

35:42.550 --> 35:45.285
Hey, it's fine. We'll... we'll try again.

35:46.817 --> 35:48.689
- You're okay, right?
- I'm fine.

35:49.152 --> 35:49.999
I'm fine.

35:58.629 --> 35:59.622
So you're leaving?

36:00.818 --> 36:03.200
I told you, I don't have a choice.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.108
Marry me.

36:11.279 --> 36:13.392
What did you just say?

36:14.643 --> 36:15.766
I said, "marry me."

36:16.409 --> 36:17.668
You've got to be joking.

36:17.735 --> 36:18.769
No.

36:19.313 --> 36:21.254
I'm serious.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.740
You made me a promise,
and I'm holding you to it.

36:27.433 --> 36:29.643
Marrying me fixes everything.

36:32.762 --> 36:34.339
All you have to do is say "yes."

36:45.412 --> 36:46.724
What do you want?

36:46.730 --> 36:48.760
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

36:49.552 --> 36:51.977
I never should have made
that tape, but you got to know

36:51.986 --> 36:54.801
that I never meant for any
of that other stuff to happen.

36:55.515 --> 36:58.378
If there was any way that I
could take it back, I would.

36:59.531 --> 37:00.380
I just... 

37:00.988 --> 37:03.449
hoped you could find it in
your heart to forgive me.

37:04.419 --> 37:05.993
The movie's wrapped, Josh.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.114
And so are we. Goodbye.

37:14.360 --> 37:17.462
Dude, we just said we were
getting the tape out there.

37:17.530 --> 37:19.865
The plan was never to blackmail
these people for money.

37:23.035 --> 37:25.303
My girl rocked it tonight.

37:34.856 --> 37:35.751
Thank you.

37:38.151 --> 37:41.089
So, it was some night, huh?

37:42.601 --> 37:43.760
You sure you had a good time?

37:43.786 --> 37:45.364
You seemed like something
was bothering you.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.428
Quinn, there's something
I need to tell you.

37:50.109 --> 37:53.081
Remember the tennis player that
wouldn't take no for an answer?

37:53.149 --> 37:54.141
Yeah.

37:54.173 --> 37:57.564
Well, she is the girl who
bought my portrait tonight.

37:58.006 --> 37:59.232
That Katie girl?

38:01.562 --> 38:03.682
I... I don't understand.

38:23.646 --> 38:25.028
Wait, you know her?

38:27.150 --> 38:28.884
Why do you have a photo with her?

38:28.951 --> 38:30.209
Because it's not her.

38:31.404 --> 38:32.937
It's Sara.

38:41.517 --> 38:44.103
You showed me something
pretty special tonight.

38:44.634 --> 38:48.353
I'm trying to forget what we were
shown tonight, if you don't mind.

38:48.421 --> 38:49.905
Alex.

38:49.972 --> 38:52.457
Who would have thought
that you, of all people,

38:52.525 --> 38:53.942
would rescue her?

38:54.010 --> 38:56.628
I didn't do anything. You're
the one bailing her out.

38:56.679 --> 38:58.129
Thanks to you.

39:00.060 --> 39:01.233
What?

39:01.300 --> 39:04.486
You remember what you said
to me our first night here?

39:05.271 --> 39:06.988
"What if we ruin it?"

39:07.056 --> 39:09.441
Every night I spent away from you,

39:09.509 --> 39:11.743
I dreamed about being back here... 

39:11.811 --> 39:16.597
in this room, in this bed, with you.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.734
I dreamed about us, Brooke.

39:21.037 --> 39:24.005
And now we're here.

39:24.073 --> 39:25.173
We're back.

39:25.942 --> 39:29.578
And you look even more
beautiful than in my dreams.

39:43.204 --> 39:44.801
I love you.

39:45.511 --> 39:47.361
I never stopped loving you... 

39:47.369 --> 39:51.094
not for one night, not for one moment.

39:52.077 --> 39:53.469
And I never will.

39:53.774 --> 39:56.452
Nothing can ruin us,
