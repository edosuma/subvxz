00:31.531 --> 00:33.032
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:33.099 --> 00:33.666
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANKS SO MUCH

00:33.733 --> 00:35.235
FOR JOINING US.

00:35.301 --> 00:36.236
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.771
RUSSIA'S BRIDGE TO CRIMEA WAS

00:37.837 --> 00:38.471
SERIOUSLY DAMAGED, IN YET

00:38.538 --> 00:41.074
ANOTHER SETBACK FOR THEM,

00:41.141 --> 00:42.008
HERSCHEL WALKER ACTED OUT TEN

00:42.075 --> 00:42.675
DIFFERENT EPISODES OF "MAURY,"

00:42.742 --> 00:45.678
AND JOE BIDEN GAVE A SPEECH AT A

00:45.745 --> 00:46.246
FACTORY IN MARYLAND, THAT HE

00:46.312 --> 00:48.281
BEGAN LIKE THIS.

00:48.348 --> 00:51.017
>> LET ME START OFF WITH TWO

00:51.084 --> 00:52.619
WORDS: MADE IN AMERICA.

00:52.685 --> 00:53.453
>> John: YEAH,

00:53.520 --> 00:56.589
THAT'S THREE WORDS.

00:56.656 --> 00:57.190
THAT'S THREE WORDS.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.325
YOU JUST OUTBIDEN'ED YOURSELF.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.193
I'M SURPRISED THE REST OF THE

01:00.260 --> 01:01.761
SPEECH DIDN'T GO, "TWO WORDS:

01:01.828 --> 01:02.529
MADE IN AMERICA, FIVE WORDS:

01:02.595 --> 01:03.263
CRUSHED IT.

01:03.329 --> 01:04.998
NINE WORDS: YEP.

01:05.064 --> 01:07.066
FOUR WORDS: YOU BETCHA."

01:07.133 --> 01:09.068
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START IN

01:09.135 --> 01:10.136
IRAN.

01:10.203 --> 01:10.937
THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE HEARD,

01:11.004 --> 01:11.871
"YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY MAKE YOGURT

01:11.938 --> 01:12.839
INTO A SODA," AND WERE LIKE,

01:12.906 --> 01:15.775
"THE FUCK WE CAN'T!"

01:15.842 --> 01:17.076
DON'T KNOCK IT TILL YOU TRY IT.

01:17.143 --> 01:17.811
FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS,

01:17.877 --> 01:19.179
THERE'VE BEEN HUGE PROTESTS ALL

01:19.245 --> 01:20.146
OVER IRAN, FOLLOWING THE DEATH

01:20.213 --> 01:21.748
OF A YOUNG WOMAN NAMED

01:21.815 --> 01:23.149
MAHSA AMINI AFTER HER ARREST FOR

01:23.216 --> 01:24.784
VIOLATING MANDATORY HIJAB RULES

01:24.851 --> 01:25.885
BY IRAN'S SO-CALLED "MORALITY

01:25.952 --> 01:26.586
POLICE."

01:26.653 --> 01:28.288
AND I KNOW "MORALITY POLICE"

01:28.354 --> 01:29.722
SOUNDS LIKE A FAKE NAME

01:29.789 --> 01:30.957
TUCKER CARLSON MADE UP FOR

01:31.024 --> 01:32.358
PEOPLE WHO WON'T LET HIM SAY

01:32.425 --> 01:34.828
SLURS ANYMORE, BUT IT'S A VERY

01:34.894 --> 01:37.063
REAL ORGANIZATION THAT ENFORCES

01:37.130 --> 01:38.665
DRESS AND BEHAVIOR RULES, WHICH

01:38.731 --> 01:40.900
HAS BEEN NEWLY ENERGIZED UNDER A

01:40.967 --> 01:41.701
HARD-LINE NEW PRESIDENT WHO TOOK

01:41.768 --> 01:43.203
OFFICE LAST YEAR.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.238
FOR A WHILE NOW, THERE'S BEEN

01:45.305 --> 01:46.139
WIDESPREAD DISCONTENT IN IRAN

01:46.206 --> 01:46.739
OVER REPRESSION, CORRUPTION,

01:46.806 --> 01:48.274
INFLATION, AND ECONOMIC PAIN

01:48.341 --> 01:49.642
CAUSED IN PART BY U.S.

01:49.709 --> 01:57.951
SANCTIONS.

01:58.017 --> 01:58.585
BUT THE DEATH OF MAHSA AMINI'S

01:58.651 --> 02:00.186
HAS UNLEASHED A TORRENT OF FURY,

02:00.253 --> 02:00.820
LED BY ONE GROUP IN PARTICULAR.

02:00.887 --> 02:01.454
>> SCHOOLGIRLS HAVE NOW JOINED

02:01.521 --> 02:02.021
ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS IN

02:02.088 --> 02:02.222
IRAN.

02:02.288 --> 02:02.856
HERE IN CAPITAL TEHRAN, THEY'RE

02:02.922 --> 02:03.623
MARCHING IN THE STREETS,

02:03.690 --> 02:04.657
CHANTING "DEATH TO THE

02:04.724 --> 02:08.228
DICTATOR."

02:08.294 --> 02:09.996
THE BIGGEST THREAT FOR MORE THAN

02:10.063 --> 02:12.899
A DECADE TO IRAN'S RADICAL

02:12.966 --> 02:13.933
ISLAMIC LEADERSHIP ARE NOW

02:14.000 --> 02:15.602
TEENAGERS.

02:15.668 --> 02:16.803
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.238
TEENAGERS ARE THE SCARIEST THING

02:18.304 --> 02:20.206
TO THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT.

02:20.273 --> 02:22.408
WHICH HONESTLY FEELS RIGHT.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.310
TEENAGERS ARE TERRIFYING.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.179
THE LIST OF GROUPS I NEVER WANT

02:26.246 --> 02:28.081
MAD AT ME GOES, IN ASCENDING

02:28.147 --> 02:28.748
ORDER, THE MAFIA, THE MAFIA FROM

02:28.815 --> 02:30.683
FIFTY YEARS AGO, JASON MOMOA,

02:30.750 --> 02:32.318
WHICH IS LESS ABOUT HIM BEING

02:32.385 --> 02:33.119
PHYSICALLY IMPOSING AND MORE

02:33.186 --> 02:35.054
ABOUT ME CRAVING HIS APPROVAL,

02:35.121 --> 02:37.223
ROBOTS, SPIDERS AFTER THEY ALL

02:37.290 --> 02:38.057
LEARN TO WORK TOGETHER, AND

02:38.124 --> 02:38.758
THEN, RIGHT AT THE TOP:

02:38.825 --> 02:41.261
TEENAGE GIRLS.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.495
AND THE YOUNG WOMEN AT THE

02:42.562 --> 02:43.696
FOREFRONT OF THESE PROTESTS HAVE

02:43.763 --> 02:45.098
BEEN MAKING IT VERY CLEAR THAT

02:45.164 --> 02:46.799
THEY'RE NOT AFRAID TO STAND UP

02:46.866 --> 02:47.433
TO THE MORALITY POLICE, OR,

02:47.500 --> 02:50.937
INDEED, ANYBODY.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.372
>> THIS VIDEO SHOWS FEMALE

02:52.438 --> 02:55.542
STUDENTS IN SHIRAZ, SHOUTING

02:55.608 --> 02:58.611
"BASIJIS GET LOST" TO A MEMBER

02:58.678 --> 03:00.213
OF THE FEARED BASIJI

03:00.280 --> 03:01.581
PARAMILITARY FORCE WHO HAD BEEN

03:01.648 --> 03:02.982
INVITED TO GIVE A SPEECH.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.151
AND IN THIS VIDEO, FILMED NEAR

03:05.218 --> 03:06.386
THE CAPITAL TEHRAN, IRANIAN

03:06.452 --> 03:08.221
SCHOOLGIRLS, MANY WITHOUT THEIR

03:08.288 --> 03:09.622
HEADS COVERED, THROW OBJECTS AT

03:09.689 --> 03:11.257
A MAN AND CHASE HIM AWAY.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.825
>> John: HOLY SHIT!

03:12.892 --> 03:14.160
THE BRAVERY OF THOSE GIRLS IS

03:14.227 --> 03:16.596
GENUINELY INCREDIBLE.

03:16.663 --> 03:17.997
I PRESUME THE SCHOOL THEY ATTEND

03:18.064 --> 03:20.333
IS "THE FUCK AROUND AND FIND OUT

03:20.400 --> 03:22.101
ACADEMY FOR GIRLS."

03:22.168 --> 03:22.669
AND IF THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S

03:22.735 --> 03:23.269
CALLED, IT SHOULD BE FROM NOW

03:23.336 --> 03:24.404
ON.

03:24.470 --> 03:25.939
THESE PROTESTS ARE TAKING MANY

03:26.005 --> 03:28.341
FORMS, AND RAPIDLY SPREADING

03:28.408 --> 03:29.309
ONLINE WHEN IRANIAN WOMEN WERE

03:29.375 --> 03:30.443
FILMED CUTTING THEIR HAIR IN

03:30.510 --> 03:31.544
PROTEST, WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD

03:31.611 --> 03:32.078
STARTED DOING THE SAME IN

03:32.145 --> 03:33.413
SOLIDARITY.

03:33.479 --> 03:35.582
WHICH IS INCREDIBLY INSPIRING.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.150
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, IT'S A

03:37.216 --> 03:38.184
LITTLE HURTFUL THAT WHEN IRANIAN

03:38.251 --> 03:39.786
WOMEN CUT THEIR OWN HAIR,

03:39.852 --> 03:41.588
EVERYONE SUPPORTS THEM, BUT WHEN

03:41.654 --> 03:42.922
I CUT MY OWN HAIR, EVERYONE SAYS

03:42.989 --> 03:44.190
I LOOK LIKE AMELIE FELL

03:44.257 --> 03:44.724
HEAD-FIRST INTO A GARBAGE

03:44.791 --> 03:47.927
DISPOSAL.

03:47.994 --> 03:48.895
THEY WEREN'T WRONG ABOUT THAT --

03:48.962 --> 03:49.529
I'M JUST SAYING, IT'S A DOUBLE

03:49.596 --> 03:50.330
STANDARD.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.898
UNSURPRISINGLY, THE GOVERNMENT

03:51.965 --> 03:53.099
IS NOW VIOLENTLY CRACKING DOWN,

03:53.166 --> 03:54.467
KILLING OVER 100 PROTESTORS AND

03:54.534 --> 03:57.170
BYSTANDERS.

03:57.236 --> 03:59.205
AND AYATOLLAH KHAMEINI HAS

03:59.272 --> 04:00.139
RESORTED TO CLAIMING AMERICA'S

04:00.206 --> 04:00.907
BEHIND THESE PROTESTS, AND HAS

04:00.974 --> 04:03.343
BEEN SECRETLY INSTIGATING THEM.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.444
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE AMERICA

04:04.510 --> 04:06.145
HASN'T MEDDLED IN IRAN'S AFFAIRS

04:06.212 --> 04:08.514
IN THE PAST, BUT IN THIS

04:08.581 --> 04:09.716
INSTANCE, THE PROTESTORS SEEM

04:09.782 --> 04:13.152
VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHO THEY'RE MAD

04:13.219 --> 04:13.920
AT, AND IT IS HIM.

04:13.987 --> 04:14.687
>> THESE YOUNG GIRLS NO LONGER

04:14.754 --> 04:15.655
WANT TO SEE HIS FACE IN THEIR

04:15.722 --> 04:17.357
CLASSROOMS.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.560
INSTEAD, THEY WROTE THEIR DREAMS

04:20.627 --> 04:22.295
BEHIND HIS FRAMED PICTURE,

04:22.362 --> 04:24.330
EQUALITY AND FREEDOM, TO TURN

04:24.397 --> 04:28.201
THIS PAGE OF IRAN'S HISTORY.

04:28.267 --> 04:28.835
>> John: THAT IS EXTREMELY

04:28.901 --> 04:29.202
POWERFUL TO SEE.

04:29.268 --> 04:30.036
AND FRANKLY, I DON'T BLAME THOSE

04:30.103 --> 04:31.204
GIRLS FOR NOT WANTING TO SEE

04:31.270 --> 04:33.039
THAT PARTICULAR FACE EVERY DAY,

04:33.106 --> 04:34.307
EVEN IF HE WASN'T THE SYMBOL OF

04:34.374 --> 04:35.341
OPPRESSION AND TYRANNY.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.410
IT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT BEFORE THAT

04:37.477 --> 04:37.877
PICTURE WAS TAKEN, THE

04:37.944 --> 04:39.379
PHOTOGRAPHER SAID, "READY?

04:39.445 --> 04:40.480
THREE, TWO, ONE, WHEN A PANDA

04:40.546 --> 04:41.848
HAS TWINS, IT KEEPS THE STRONGER

04:41.914 --> 04:42.415
ONE AND ABANDONS THE OTHER.

04:42.482 --> 04:43.650
SAY CHEESE!"

04:43.716 --> 04:45.184
PERFECT!

04:45.251 --> 04:46.219
AS FOR WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, IT'S

04:46.285 --> 04:47.420
HARD TO SAY.

04:47.487 --> 04:48.421
THERE HAVE BEEN CIVILIAN

04:48.488 --> 04:49.989
UPRISINGS IN IRAN BEFORE THAT

04:50.056 --> 04:52.125
THE GOVERNMENT SNUFFED OUT, LIKE

04:52.191 --> 04:53.760
THE GREEN MOVEMENT IN 2009.

04:53.826 --> 04:54.794
AND THAT COULD WELL HAPPEN AGAIN

04:54.861 --> 04:55.895
HERE.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.797
BUT AS SOME IRANIANS HAVE SAID,

04:57.864 --> 04:58.398
THIS TIME DOES FEEL A LITTLE

04:58.464 --> 04:59.132
DIFFERENT.

04:59.198 --> 05:00.833
THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THESE

05:00.900 --> 05:02.769
PROTESTS ARE YOUNG, DEFIANT, AND

05:02.835 --> 05:04.537
FED UP WITH THE STATUS QUO.

05:04.604 --> 05:05.538
AND THEY DESERVE OUR SUSTAINED

05:05.605 --> 05:06.706
ATTENTION.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.141
BECAUSE, TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF

05:08.207 --> 05:09.375
IRAN, LET ME SAY THIS.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.110
IF I MAY BORROW SOME PHRASING

05:11.177 --> 05:12.445
FROM JOE BIDEN, I HAVE

05:12.512 --> 05:16.949
TWO WORDS FOR YOU: YOU ARE

05:17.016 --> 05:17.750
ALL ABSOLUTELY FUCKING AMAZING.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.952
AND NOW THIS.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.989
>> AND NOW, CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS

05:23.056 --> 05:28.394
KIND OF COOL GUY.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.930
>> COMING UP, AM I THE ONLY GUY

05:30.997 --> 05:31.731
WHO THINKS CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS

05:31.798 --> 05:34.000
WAS REALLY KIND OF A COOL GUY?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.436
HE DISCOVERED OUR HEMISPHERE, HE

05:36.502 --> 05:38.971
WRIST LIFE AND LIMB TO DO IT, I

05:39.038 --> 05:39.806
KNOW EVERYBODY'S BEATING UP ON

05:39.872 --> 05:40.239
HIM?

05:40.306 --> 05:42.275
I THINK THAT'S VERY UNFAIR AND

05:42.341 --> 05:43.309
HE'S NOT AROUND TO DEFEND

05:43.376 --> 05:43.609
HIMSELF.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.143
>> I'M NOT SAYING CUSTOMER

05:44.210 --> 05:44.944
COLUMBUS WAS AN ANGEL OR THAT HE

05:45.011 --> 05:46.245
WAS A PERFECT INDIVIDUAL, BUT HE

05:46.312 --> 05:46.779
OBVIOUSLY HAD SOME MAJOR

05:46.846 --> 05:51.350
ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.319
>> WE NEED TO JUDGE HIM BY THE

05:53.386 --> 05:54.620
STANDARDS OF HIS OWN TIME AND

05:54.687 --> 05:55.121
NOT OURS.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.423
BY THE WAY, BY THOSE STANDARDS,

05:57.490 --> 05:58.024
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WAS A

05:58.091 --> 05:58.558
PRETTY GOOD GUY.

05:58.624 --> 05:59.158
>> WE ARE FLAWED, IS COLUMBUS

05:59.225 --> 05:59.592
FLAWED?

05:59.659 --> 06:00.927
WAS HE FLAWED?

06:00.993 --> 06:01.394
WAS HE FLAWED?

06:01.461 --> 06:02.562
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE ON

06:02.628 --> 06:02.962
YOUR SHOW.

06:03.029 --> 06:07.800
OF COURSE HE WAS FLAWED.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.101
WE ALL ARE.

06:08.167 --> 06:08.735
WHO ARE WE TO JUDGE FOR BETTER

06:08.801 --> 06:09.302
OR FOR WORSE?

06:09.368 --> 06:10.169
>> COLUMBUS WAS AN EPIC FIGURE

06:10.236 --> 06:14.607
IN HUMAN HISTORY.

06:14.674 --> 06:17.610
>> THAT DEBATE CONTINUES.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.279
>> HE ALSO BROUGHT BACK TO

06:20.346 --> 06:27.620
EUROPE SOMETHING YOU MIGHT NOT

06:27.687 --> 06:28.755
BE AWARE OF WHICH IS POTATOES.

06:28.821 --> 06:29.188
>> John: MOVING ON.

06:29.255 --> 06:29.822
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

06:29.889 --> 06:30.690
CRIME -- Y'KNOW: MCGRUFF'S KINK.

06:30.757 --> 06:31.290
IT'S GENUINELY IMPRESSIVE THIS

06:31.357 --> 06:31.791
CRIME DOG TAUGHT A WHOLE

06:31.858 --> 06:33.292
GENERATION HOW TO BE NARCS WHILE

06:33.359 --> 06:34.393
SIMULTANEOUSLY DRESSING LIKE

06:34.460 --> 06:34.994
HE'S ABOUT TO JERK IT IN THE

06:35.061 --> 06:36.662
BACK OF A MOVIE THEATER.

06:36.729 --> 06:37.396
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

06:37.463 --> 06:38.030
TALK ABOUT HOW CRIME IS COVERED

06:38.097 --> 06:41.667
BY THE NEWS.

06:41.734 --> 06:42.335
BECAUSE THE NEWS LOVES COVERING

06:42.401 --> 06:44.137
CRIME -- SOMETIMES SERIOUSLY,

06:44.203 --> 06:49.342
AND SOMETIMES LIKE THIS.

06:49.408 --> 06:49.876
>> LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT

06:49.942 --> 06:50.543
FROM THE START: YOU'RE

06:50.610 --> 06:51.043
NEDRA BRANTLEY, RIGHT?

06:51.110 --> 06:51.677
>> I AM.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.779
>> IS YOUR NAME MIKE?

06:52.845 --> 06:54.113
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.414
>> THIS IS WHAT NEDRA'S CAR

06:55.481 --> 06:58.684
LOOKED LIKE TODAY.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.552
"MIKE IS A CHEATER" SPRAY

06:59.619 --> 07:01.354
PAINTED ALL OVER IT.

07:01.420 --> 07:01.921
CHEATER, CHEATER, MIKE IS A

07:01.988 --> 07:03.923
CHEATER.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.893
MIKE, MIKE, MIKE, MIKE, MIKE,

07:06.959 --> 07:07.960
MIKE, MIKE, SEE WHAT YOU'VE

07:08.027 --> 07:08.928
DONE?

07:08.995 --> 07:10.163
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

07:10.229 --> 07:11.964
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

07:12.031 --> 07:17.370
BUT YOU MAY WANT TO START

07:17.436 --> 07:18.271
CHANGING YOUR WAYS -- OR

07:18.337 --> 07:19.806
CHANGING YOUR NAME.

07:19.872 --> 07:20.807
>> John: YES.

07:20.873 --> 07:23.009
I WANT THAT MAN ON MY TV ALL DAY

07:23.075 --> 07:24.577
EVERY DAY.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.279
IN FACT, IF YOU SENT NBC4

07:26.345 --> 07:32.218
WASHINGTON'S PAT COLLINS TO

07:32.285 --> 07:33.986
UKRAINE, I'D GUARANTEE IT'D BE

07:34.053 --> 07:34.587
SORTED OUT TOMORROW.

07:34.654 --> 07:35.254
"VLAD VLAD VLAD VLAD VLAD -- SEE

07:35.321 --> 07:35.688
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?!"

07:35.755 --> 07:36.322
YOU'VE UNDOUBTEDLY NOTICED THAT

07:36.389 --> 07:38.758
CRIME MAKES UP A SIGNIFICANT

07:38.825 --> 07:39.292
PART OF YOUR LOCAL NEWS'S

07:39.358 --> 07:40.026
PROGRAMMING.

07:40.092 --> 07:43.095
BUT THE SCALE OF THAT COVERAGE

07:43.162 --> 07:43.796
HAS A REAL IMPACT.

07:43.863 --> 07:44.897
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT VIEWING

07:44.964 --> 07:46.165
LOCAL TV NEWS IS RELATED TO

07:46.232 --> 07:46.833
INCREASED FEAR OF, AND CONCERN

07:46.899 --> 07:49.435
ABOUT CRIME, AND THAT TV NEWS

07:49.502 --> 07:50.770
VIEWERS ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO

07:50.837 --> 07:53.439
SUPPORT TOUGHER CRIME POLICIES.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.841
WHICH DOES HELP EXPLAIN WHY OUR

07:54.907 --> 07:57.844
PERCEPTIONS OF CRIME CAN BE

07:57.910 --> 07:58.611
SHARPLY AT ODDS WITH THE REALITY

07:58.678 --> 08:00.012
OF IT.

08:00.079 --> 08:01.013
FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS, GALLUP

08:01.080 --> 08:02.181
HAS ASKED AMERICANS WHETHER THEY

08:02.248 --> 08:04.317
THINK THE U.S. HAS MORE OR LESS

08:04.383 --> 08:16.028
CRIME COMPARED TO THE YEAR

08:16.095 --> 08:17.029
BEFORE, AND IN

08:17.096 --> 08:17.530
IN EVERY YEAR BUT ONE,

08:17.597 --> 08:18.130
EVEN AS THE ACTUAL CRIME RATE

08:18.197 --> 08:18.464
HAS PLUMMETED.

08:18.531 --> 08:19.065
INTERESTINGLY, THE ONE YEAR A

08:19.131 --> 08:19.665
MAJORITY SAID "LESS" WAS 2001.

08:19.732 --> 08:20.333
FAMOUSLY A YEAR WHERE EVERYTHING

08:20.399 --> 08:21.334
WAS SUPER CHILL, NO DRAMA, JUST

08:21.400 --> 08:24.103
VIBES.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.005
TV NEWS LEANS HARD ON "THIS

08:26.072 --> 08:28.507
COULD HAPPEN TO YOU" CRIME

08:28.574 --> 08:30.743
STORIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO

08:30.810 --> 08:31.344
PULL YOU IN -- WITH THE LATEST

08:31.410 --> 08:32.245
VERSION BEING THIS.

08:32.311 --> 08:33.713
>> AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO SOUND

08:33.779 --> 08:35.014
THE ALARM ABOUT THE DANGERS OF

08:35.081 --> 08:36.115
RAINBOW FENTANYL.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.850
>> ANOTHER WARNING ABOUT RAINBOW

08:37.917 --> 08:39.552
FENTANYL -- THE DEADLY DRUG

08:39.619 --> 08:40.586
DISGUISED AS CANDY!

08:40.653 --> 08:41.487
>> IT IS CALLED RAINBOW

08:41.554 --> 08:43.055
FENTANYL.

08:43.122 --> 08:45.057
THE COLORFUL CANDY-LIKE

08:45.124 --> 08:46.459
APPEARANCE IS ACTUALLY DESIGNED

08:46.525 --> 08:47.727
TO APPEAL TO YOUNG KIDS.

08:47.793 --> 08:48.928
>> THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE, THEY'RE

08:48.995 --> 08:50.363
COLORFUL, THEY LOOK LIKE CANDY.

08:50.429 --> 08:52.098
>> THIS IS EVERY PARENT'S WORST

08:52.164 --> 08:53.933
NIGHTMARE.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.068
ESPECIALLY IN THE MONTH OF

08:56.135 --> 08:57.136
OCTOBER, AS HALLOWEEN FAST

08:57.203 --> 08:58.838
APPROACHES.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.439
THIS IS TREACHEROUS DECEPTION TO

09:00.506 --> 09:03.542
MARKET RAINBOW FENTANYL LIKE

09:03.609 --> 09:04.911
CANDY.

09:04.977 --> 09:06.279
>> John: OKAY SO, FIRST, RAINBOW

09:06.345 --> 09:07.880
FENTANYL SOUNDS LIKE THE TITLE

09:07.947 --> 09:09.916
OF A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE OF

09:09.982 --> 09:11.384
"MY LITTLE PONY."

09:11.450 --> 09:12.385
BUT SECOND, WHILE THE IDEA OF IT

09:12.451 --> 09:16.555
BEING MADE TO TARGET KIDS SOUNDS

09:16.622 --> 09:17.890
SCARY, EXPERTS ON NARCOTICS HAVE

09:17.957 --> 09:19.158
POINTED OUT: THOSE PILLS ARE

09:19.225 --> 09:20.660
ALMOST CERTAINLY COLORED JUST TO

09:20.726 --> 09:22.261
DIFFERENTIATE PRODUCTS, AND IT

09:22.328 --> 09:23.663
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MARKETING

09:23.729 --> 09:24.397
TO KIDS AT ALL, PERIOD,

09:24.463 --> 09:27.833
WHATSOEVER.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.502
WHICH DOES MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE

09:29.568 --> 09:33.806
KIDS -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

09:33.873 --> 09:34.407
NOT AN IDEAL CUSTOMER BASE FOR

09:34.473 --> 09:34.907
EXPENSIVE STREET DRUGS.

09:34.974 --> 09:35.474
BECAUSE EVEN IF DEALERS WERE

09:35.541 --> 09:37.176
TARGETING TRICK-OR-TREATERS WITH

09:37.243 --> 09:38.878
A "FIRST ONE'S ON THE HOUSE"

09:38.945 --> 09:40.346
STRATEGY, WHERE DO YOU EXPECT

09:40.413 --> 09:42.114
LITTLE ZEKE TO COME UP WITH THE

09:42.181 --> 09:42.581
CASH FOR THE NEXT ONE?

09:42.648 --> 09:43.716
SURE, HE'S GOT HIS WEEKLY

09:43.783 --> 09:44.717
ALLOWANCE, BUT HE SMACKED HIS

09:44.784 --> 09:45.384
BROTHER YESTERDAY, SO THAT'S

09:45.451 --> 09:46.986
THAT DOLLAR GONE.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.287
AND THE REST OF HIS NET WORTH IS

09:48.354 --> 09:49.021
TIED UP IN LEGO STORE GIFT

09:49.088 --> 09:50.122
CARDS.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.657
HE'S USELESS TO DEALERS.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.059
MAYBE CHECK BACK IN TEN YEARS

09:53.125 --> 09:53.826
WHEN HE GETS PRESCRIBED OXY

09:53.893 --> 09:55.127
AFTER A LACROSSE INJURY.

09:55.194 --> 09:58.097
AND LOOK, THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT

09:58.164 --> 09:59.198
OPIOID ADDICTION AMONG YOUNG

09:59.265 --> 10:00.499
PEOPLE ISN'T A REAL ISSUE -- IT

10:00.566 --> 10:01.867
OBVIOUSLY IS.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.402
BUT IT DOESN'T HELP THE

10:03.469 --> 10:04.537
CONVERSATION AROUND THAT ISSUE,

10:04.603 --> 10:06.072
TO HAVE NEWSCASTERS JUMPING ON

10:06.138 --> 10:07.506
SPLASHY "YOUR KID'S HALLOWEEN

10:07.573 --> 10:09.375
CANDY COULD BE FENTANYL" STORIES

10:09.442 --> 10:11.010
THAT EVEN IN THIS REPORT, THEY

10:11.077 --> 10:11.744
HALF-ACKNOWLEDGE IS BULLSHIT,

10:11.811 --> 10:12.945
RIGHT AT THE VERY END.

10:13.012 --> 10:14.780
>> POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE

10:14.847 --> 10:16.115
WARNING PARENTS TO CHECK THE

10:16.182 --> 10:16.949
CANDY THEIR KIDS BRING HOME FROM

10:17.016 --> 10:18.150
TRICK OR TREATING.

10:18.217 --> 10:20.386
>> WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS

10:20.453 --> 10:21.954
WHO ARE TAKING PILLS THAT THEY

10:22.021 --> 10:22.521
THINK IS CANDY AND IS REALLY

10:22.588 --> 10:24.457
NOT.

10:24.523 --> 10:25.558
>> THERE HAVE BEEN NO INSTANCES

10:25.624 --> 10:26.993
OF THAT HAPPENING.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.095
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE NOT.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.463
I'M SO GLAD YOU TACKED THAT

10:30.529 --> 10:32.531
DISCLAIMER ON AT THE END THERE.

10:32.598 --> 10:33.699
I'M SURE THE THREE SECOND DEBUNK

10:33.766 --> 10:34.834
READ OVER THE STATION LOGO IS

10:34.900 --> 10:37.403
EXACTLY WHAT EVERYONE'S GOING TO

10:37.470 --> 10:38.404
TAKE AWAY FROM THAT REPORT, AND

10:38.471 --> 10:38.971
DEFINITELY NOT THE IMAGES OF

10:39.038 --> 10:39.939
LITTLE HULKS STICKING THEIR

10:40.006 --> 10:41.240
HANDS INTO BOWLS OF

10:41.307 --> 10:43.709
SKITTLE-SHAPED SMACK.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.778
BUT THAT INSTINCT TO RUN AN

10:45.845 --> 10:47.513
EYE-CATCHING CRIME STORY WITHOUT

10:47.580 --> 10:48.948
BEING SKEPTICAL OF ITS SOURCING

10:49.015 --> 10:49.515
IS UNFORTUNATELY INCREDIBLY

10:49.582 --> 10:50.216
COMMON.

10:50.282 --> 10:51.984
SO GIVEN THAT, TONIGHT, LET'S

10:52.051 --> 10:53.853
TALK ABOUT CRIME REPORTING --

10:53.919 --> 10:54.887
SPECIFICALLY, THE INCENTIVES

10:54.954 --> 10:56.355
DRIVING THE OUTLETS THAT COVER

10:56.422 --> 10:57.423
CRIME, THE FLAWED SOURCES THEY

10:57.490 --> 10:58.924
RELY UPON, AND THE GREATER HARM

10:58.991 --> 11:00.659
IT CAN DO TO ALL OF US.

11:00.726 --> 11:05.531
AND LET'S START WITH THE OBVIOUS

11:05.598 --> 11:06.165
HERE -- CRIME HAS ALWAYS DRIVEN

11:06.232 --> 11:06.399
RATINGS.

11:06.465 --> 11:06.999
THE MANTRA "IF IT BLEEDS, IT

11:07.066 --> 11:07.533
LEADS" HAS BEEN AROUND FOR

11:07.600 --> 11:07.967
DECADES.

11:08.034 --> 11:10.036
BUT THE PHILOSOPHY REALLY TOOK

11:10.102 --> 11:11.370
HOLD AROUND THE 1970S, WHEN TWO

11:11.437 --> 11:13.072
LOCAL STATIONS IN PHILADELPHIA

11:13.139 --> 11:15.041
PIONEERED THE "EYEWITNESS" AND

11:15.107 --> 11:16.042
"ACTION NEWS" FORMATS, WHICH

11:16.108 --> 11:17.843
LEANED HEAVILY ON CRIME NEWS.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.178
AS ONE ANCHOR THERE EXPLAINED,

11:19.245 --> 11:20.413
"CRIME WAS CHEAP TO COVER.

11:20.479 --> 11:21.881
IT WAS EASY TO COVER.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.416
THE ASSIGNMENT DESK SAID TO THE

11:23.482 --> 11:24.050
CAMERAMAN, 'YOU SHOOT THE SCENE,

11:24.116 --> 11:25.584
YOU SHOOT THE BLOOD, YOU SHOOT

11:25.651 --> 11:26.786
VICTIMS, WHATEVER THEY GOT.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.588
AND YOU CAN DO IT IN 20

11:29.655 --> 11:31.824
SECONDS.'"

11:31.891 --> 11:32.291
BUT THAT ISN'T GOOD.

11:32.358 --> 11:32.925
THE MOST MEANINGFUL STORIES ARE

11:32.992 --> 11:33.459
RARELY THE FASTEST OR THE

11:33.526 --> 11:34.360
CHEAPEST.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.061
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT

11:35.127 --> 11:36.996
BECAUSE I HOST "VERY LONG NEWS

11:37.063 --> 11:38.064
STORIES THAT ARE ALSO EXPENSIVE

11:38.130 --> 11:40.800
TO PRODUCE: THE COMEDY SHOW,"

11:40.866 --> 11:41.500
I'M SAYING IT BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.669
NONETHELESS, THOSE FORMATS

11:43.736 --> 11:45.037
QUICKLY SPREAD TO 200 MARKETS

11:45.104 --> 11:46.739
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.708
AND BY THE 1990S, CNN EVEN DID A

11:49.775 --> 11:50.876
WHOLE PIECE WONDERING IF ALL

11:50.943 --> 11:52.244
THAT CRIME COVERAGE WAS

11:52.311 --> 11:54.313
NECESSARILY A GOOD THING.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.015
>> CRIME NEWS CAN LOOK A LOT

11:56.082 --> 11:58.184
LIKE ENTERTAINMENT.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.086
>> THE DARK BLACK IS CRIME

12:00.152 --> 12:01.387
COVERAGE.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.655
>> ONE LOS ANGELES STATION, A

12:02.721 --> 12:05.458
STUDY SHOWS, SPENT OVER HALF ITS

12:05.524 --> 12:05.891
NEWSCASTS ON CRIME.

12:05.958 --> 12:06.792
OTHERS CAME CLOSE.

12:06.859 --> 12:10.996
>> I'M CONVINCED THAT IF YOU

12:11.063 --> 12:12.198
COULD GET EVERYONE WHO WANTED TO

12:12.264 --> 12:13.899
COMMIT SUICIDE TO DO IT ON -- IN

12:13.966 --> 12:16.335
A PUBLIC PLACE WHERE THE MEDIA

12:16.402 --> 12:17.903
COULD BE PRESENT, WE WOULD HAVE

12:17.970 --> 12:19.238
LIKE A TV SHOW CALLED "SUICIDE

12:19.305 --> 12:20.906
TODAY."

12:20.973 --> 12:22.441
>> John: WOW, WAY TO BRING DOWN

12:22.508 --> 12:26.779
THE ROOM.

12:26.846 --> 12:27.680
BUT NOT TO STEP ON THAT MAN'S

12:27.746 --> 12:28.581
CREATIVE PURSUITS, BUT THERE'S

12:28.647 --> 12:29.215
ALREADY PRIMETIME PROGRAMMING

12:29.281 --> 12:30.549
WHERE PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES FOR

12:30.616 --> 12:31.684
OUR ENTERTAINMENT -- IT'S CALLED

12:31.750 --> 12:32.985
MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.

12:33.052 --> 12:33.919
HAPPY CONCUSSION SEASON FOOTBALL

12:33.986 --> 12:35.087
FANS!

12:35.154 --> 12:38.791
IT SURE FEELS LIKE THIS SPORT

12:38.858 --> 12:39.625
MAYBE SHOULDN'T EXIST!

12:39.692 --> 12:40.593
SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RAISING THE

12:40.659 --> 12:42.094
ALARM ABOUT OUR OBSESSION WITH

12:42.161 --> 12:43.429
CRIME NEWS FOR A WHILE.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.064
BUT IT'S CLEARLY BEEN HARD FOR

12:45.131 --> 12:46.532
NEWS OUTLETS TO GIVE IT UP.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.300
AS THEY'RE CONSTANTLY MAKING

12:48.367 --> 12:49.835
SPACE FOR STORIES ABOUT CRIMES

12:49.902 --> 12:51.036
-- BE THEY MAJOR OR INCREDIBLY

12:51.103 --> 12:52.505
MINOR -- OFTEN ILLUSTRATED WITH

12:52.571 --> 12:54.306
MUGSHOTS.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.274
THE "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS" EVEN

12:55.341 --> 12:57.643
HAS MUGSHOT GALLERIES ON THEIR

12:57.710 --> 12:58.844
WEBSITE RIGHT NOW, WITH TITLES

12:58.911 --> 12:59.945
LIKE, "CRIMINALLY BAD HAIR

13:00.012 --> 13:01.147
DAYS."

13:01.213 --> 13:02.948
AND "BABES BEHIND BARS."

13:03.015 --> 13:07.753
IT'S FUN, ISN'T IT?

13:07.820 --> 13:08.521
IT'S FUN, BECAUSE IT'S THEIR

13:08.587 --> 13:08.787
WORST DAY.

13:08.854 --> 13:09.822
AND THE THING IS, THE FACES THAT

13:09.889 --> 13:10.456
GET SHOWN CAN COMPOUND EXISTING

13:10.523 --> 13:10.990
INEQUITIES IN OUR JUSTICE

13:11.056 --> 13:11.624
SYSTEM.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.592
A STUDY A FEW YEARS AGO HERE IN

13:13.659 --> 13:14.894
NEW YORK FOUND THAT, WHILE

13:14.960 --> 13:16.695
AROUND A QUARTER OF THE CITY'S

13:16.762 --> 13:18.864
POPULATION IS BLACK, BLACK

13:18.931 --> 13:20.366
PEOPLE MADE UP HALF OF ALL

13:20.432 --> 13:22.301
ARRESTS AND THREE-QUARTERS OF

13:22.368 --> 13:23.702
CRIMINALS SHOWN ON THE NEWS.

13:23.769 --> 13:24.703
WHICH IS CLEARLY GOING TO

13:24.770 --> 13:26.071
DISTORT PUBLIC PERCEPTION.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.340
AND WHILE OUTLETS MAY JUSTIFY

13:28.407 --> 13:29.141
REPORTING ON SENSATIONAL ARRESTS

13:29.208 --> 13:30.910
AS "PART OF THE PUBLIC

13:30.976 --> 13:32.912
INTEREST", FAR TOO OFTEN --

13:32.978 --> 13:35.681
WHETHER DUE TO A LACK OF TIME,

13:35.748 --> 13:37.449
OR RESOURCES, OR INCLINATION --

13:37.516 --> 13:38.083
THEY DON'T FOLLOW UP ON WHAT THE

13:38.150 --> 13:38.918
OUTCOMES OF THOSE CASES ARE.

13:38.984 --> 13:39.485
WHICH CAN SERIOUSLY IMPACT

13:39.552 --> 13:41.820
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.055
TAKE DARCELL TROTTER -- HE AND

13:43.122 --> 13:45.124
HIS BROTHER WERE ACCUSED OF

13:45.191 --> 13:46.058
SEXUAL ASSAULT IN 2012, BY A

13:46.125 --> 13:47.326
WOMAN WHO NOT ONLY RECANTED HER

13:47.393 --> 13:48.928
ACCUSATIONS, BUT PLED GUILTY TO

13:48.994 --> 13:50.362
FILING A FALSE POLICE REPORT.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.097
THE PROBLEM IS, THEIR CHARGES

13:52.164 --> 13:54.900
HAD ALREADY MADE THE LOCAL NEWS,

13:54.967 --> 13:56.035
WHICH THEN NEVER GOT AROUND TO

13:56.101 --> 13:57.002
MENTIONING THE CHARGES WERE

13:57.069 --> 13:58.137
DISMISSED.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.139
AND YEARS LATER, WITH

14:00.206 --> 14:01.840
UNCORRECTED STORIES STILL

14:01.907 --> 14:02.708
SITTING ON NEWS SITES, DARCELL

14:02.775 --> 14:03.409
WAS HAVING TO MAKE CALLS LIKE

14:03.475 --> 14:04.777
THESE.

14:04.843 --> 14:05.678
>> HOW YOU DOING, JIM?

14:05.744 --> 14:07.313
MY NAME IS DARCELL TROTTER AND

14:07.379 --> 14:11.517
IT WAS AN ARTICLE REGARDING OF

14:11.584 --> 14:12.084
ACCUSED OF -- BEING ACCUSED OF

14:12.151 --> 14:13.619
SEXUAL ASSAULT, ME, MY TWIN

14:13.686 --> 14:14.453
BROTHER.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.554
>> DID WE DO A STORY WHERE THE

14:15.621 --> 14:16.255
CHARGES WERE DROPPED TOO?

14:16.322 --> 14:18.023
>> NO, YOU GUYS NEVER DID THAT.

14:18.090 --> 14:18.657
>> WE SHOULD'VE HAD A FOLLOW-UP

14:18.724 --> 14:21.327
STORY THAT CHARGES WERE DROPPED.

14:21.393 --> 14:21.994
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT WOULD HAVE

14:22.061 --> 14:23.596
BEEN NICE.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.397
>> John: YEAH, IT WOULD'VE BEEN!

14:25.464 --> 14:26.465
AND IF I COULD JUST TALK TO THE

14:26.532 --> 14:27.466
"JIM" THERE FOR A SECOND: HEY

14:27.533 --> 14:30.202
JIM -- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

14:30.269 --> 14:30.769
SHORT FOR JAMES, JIMOTHY, OR

14:30.836 --> 14:32.404
JIMIROQUAI.

14:32.471 --> 14:33.906
BUT EITHER WAY, JIM?

14:33.973 --> 14:34.873
YOUR PAPER GOOFED!

14:34.940 --> 14:37.343
YOU CAN'T JUST REPORT THE START

14:37.409 --> 14:38.110
OF A STORY AND IGNORE THE END.

14:38.177 --> 14:38.844
IMAGINE IF THE NEWS HADN'T

14:38.911 --> 14:40.246
COVERED THE END OF BALLOON BOY.

14:40.312 --> 14:40.679
OH, WELL!

14:40.746 --> 14:42.281
GUESS HE'S STILL UP THERE!

14:42.348 --> 14:43.482
THE BALLOON HAS LEFT MY

14:43.549 --> 14:46.652
IMMEDIATE LINE OF VISION, SO,

14:46.719 --> 14:47.720
WHO REALLY GIVES A SHIT!

14:47.786 --> 14:49.822
SO THE NEWS MEDIA CAN BE OVERLY

14:49.888 --> 14:50.756
RELIANT ON EYE-CATCHING CRIME

14:50.823 --> 14:51.757
STORIES THAT ARE QUICK AND EASY

14:51.824 --> 14:52.625
TO TURN AROUND.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.693
AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE

14:54.760 --> 14:55.527
DAILY CRIME BEAT OPERATES

14:55.594 --> 14:56.996
ACTUALLY LEADS TO ONE OF THE

14:57.062 --> 14:58.163
BIGGEST ISSUES IN CRIME

14:58.230 --> 14:59.665
COVERAGE, WHICH IS THAT IT OFTEN

14:59.732 --> 15:00.799
RELIES HEAVILY ON A SINGLE

15:00.866 --> 15:03.002
SOURCE.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.570
IT'S WHY, IF YOU WATCH TV NEWS

15:04.637 --> 15:05.638
FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME, YOU'LL

15:05.704 --> 15:06.939
UNDOUBTEDLY HEAR ONE PARTICULAR

15:07.006 --> 15:08.340
PHRASE.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.875
>> THE LOVINGTON POLICE SAY THEY

15:09.942 --> 15:11.477
KNOW WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A

15:11.543 --> 15:12.611
PRANK AT A LOCAL PARK.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.013
>> POLICE IN FAIRFIELD SAY AN

15:14.079 --> 15:15.180
OFFICER WAS ATTACKED WITH BEAR

15:15.247 --> 15:16.181
SPRAY.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.549
>> POLICE SAY NO SUSPECTS ARE IN

15:17.616 --> 15:17.950
CUSTODY.

15:18.017 --> 15:18.884
>> POLICE SAY --

15:18.951 --> 15:19.418
>> POLICE SAY --

15:19.485 --> 15:20.019
>> POLICE SAY --

15:20.085 --> 15:20.719
>> POLICE SAY --

15:20.786 --> 15:21.587
>> POLICE SAY --

15:21.654 --> 15:23.188
>> POLICE SAY --

15:23.255 --> 15:25.391
>> John: YEAH, "POLICE SAY" IS A

15:25.457 --> 15:26.525
PHRASE YOU CONSTANTLY HEAR FROM

15:26.592 --> 15:28.227
THE MOUTHS OF NEWS REPORTERS.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.028
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH,

15:29.094 --> 15:30.029
"THIS JUST IN," OR

15:30.095 --> 15:31.330
"BACK TO YOU," OR

15:31.397 --> 15:32.798
"I APOLOGIZE FOR THE ACCENT I

15:32.865 --> 15:35.401
DID ON CINCO DE MAYO."

15:35.467 --> 15:37.236
AND LOOK, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY

15:37.303 --> 15:38.037
NOTHING WRONG WITH CALLING THE

15:38.103 --> 15:39.471
POLICE TO ASK QUESTIONS.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.773
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON A

15:40.839 --> 15:41.974
DEADLINE, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS REACH

15:42.041 --> 15:42.941
ARRESTED CIVILIANS OR THEIR

15:43.008 --> 15:44.610
ATTORNEYS, WHO SOMETIMES DON'T

15:44.677 --> 15:45.844
WANT TO TALK WITH YOU ANYWAY.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.147
AND POLICE CAN BE EASY TO REACH

15:48.213 --> 15:48.981
-- MANY LARGER DEPARTMENTS HAVE

15:49.048 --> 15:50.749
EVEN SET UP ROBUST

15:50.816 --> 15:51.950
MEDIA-RELATIONS DIVISIONS.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.352
THE LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S

15:53.419 --> 15:55.487
DEPARTMENT HAS 42 PEOPLE IN ITS

15:55.554 --> 15:56.755
INFORMATION BUREAU, AT AN ANNUAL

15:56.822 --> 15:58.624
COST OF $4.8 MILLION, AND THE

15:58.691 --> 16:00.726
LAPD SPENDS OVER $3 MILLION FOR

16:00.793 --> 16:03.195
25 PEOPLE IN SIMILAR UNITS.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.297
WHICH IS ALREADY TELLING.

16:05.364 --> 16:06.465
BECAUSE WHILE A CERTAIN AMOUNT

16:06.532 --> 16:08.334
OF SPENDING IS NECESSARY, YOU

16:08.400 --> 16:09.902
DON'T SPEND THAT MUCH ON PR IF

16:09.968 --> 16:11.570
THINGS ARE GOING "GREAT."

16:11.637 --> 16:12.738
FOR CONTEXT, ALL THOSE BUDGETS

16:12.805 --> 16:15.207
COMBINED EQUAL JUST ONE MONTH'S

16:15.274 --> 16:15.708
SALARY FOR EZRA MILLER'S

16:15.774 --> 16:16.875
PUBLICIST.

16:16.942 --> 16:22.348
THEY ARE SO TIRED.

16:22.414 --> 16:22.781
THEY NEED TO SLEEP.

16:22.848 --> 16:23.415
EVEN SMALLER POLICE DEPARTMENTS

16:23.482 --> 16:24.750
CAN HAVE PUBLIC INFORMATION

16:24.817 --> 16:26.552
OFFICERS, OR PIO'S, AND AS THIS

16:26.618 --> 16:27.720
ONE PROUDLY NOTES, HIS PRESS

16:27.786 --> 16:28.754
RELEASES CAN MAKE IT STRAIGHT TO

16:28.821 --> 16:30.356
AIR.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.291
>> SOMETHING MAJOR HAPPENS,

16:32.358 --> 16:33.892
WHETHER IT'S A SHOOTING OR SOME

16:33.959 --> 16:34.526
MAJOR CAR ACCIDENT, WHATEVER IT

16:34.593 --> 16:35.361
IS.

16:35.427 --> 16:37.062
YOU GO BACK TO YOUR OFFICE.

16:37.129 --> 16:38.964
YOU TYPE UP THIS LONG PRESS

16:39.031 --> 16:40.299
RELEASE, AND YOU SEND IT OUT TO

16:40.366 --> 16:41.100
THE PUBLIC AND ALL THE NEWS

16:41.166 --> 16:42.101
AGENCIES.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.235
WITHIN MINUTES, YOU HAVE

16:43.302 --> 16:44.403
REPORTERS FROM ALL OVER THE

16:44.470 --> 16:45.938
COUNTRY CALLING YOU.

16:46.004 --> 16:47.473
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGELY

16:47.539 --> 16:49.208
SATISFYING THAT WHEN YOU PUT OUT

16:49.274 --> 16:51.176
THAT PRESS RELEASE, HOURS LATER,

16:51.243 --> 16:53.846
YOU'RE WATCHING THE NEWS, AND

16:53.912 --> 16:56.081
EVERY STATION THAT'S TALKING

16:56.148 --> 16:58.817
ABOUT YOUR STORY IS LITERALLY

16:58.884 --> 17:00.119
READING YOUR PRESS RELEASE WORD

17:00.185 --> 17:02.254
FOR WORD.

17:02.321 --> 17:02.888
>> John: SET ASIDE THE FACT THAT

17:02.955 --> 17:03.422
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MAN

17:03.489 --> 17:05.224
ANSWERS THE QUESTION "WHAT IF

17:05.290 --> 17:06.825
FRED DURST BUT WORSE?"

17:06.892 --> 17:07.993
THAT CLAIM THAT THE POLICE'S

17:08.060 --> 17:09.528
VERSIONS OF EVENTS CAN BE

17:09.595 --> 17:10.462
PARROTED VERBATIM IN THE PRESS

17:10.529 --> 17:11.830
IS GENUINELY ALARMING.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.799
ALTHOUGH I CAN'T REALLY FAULT

17:13.866 --> 17:14.867
HIM FOR BEING EXCITED AT SEEING

17:14.933 --> 17:15.768
HIS WORK READ WORD FOR WORD ON

17:15.834 --> 17:16.969
TV.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.270
ASK MY WRITERS AND THEY'LL TELL

17:18.337 --> 17:19.571
YOU THEY EXPERIENCE THE SAME

17:19.638 --> 17:20.706
THRILL WHENEVER I READ ONE OF

17:20.773 --> 17:22.141
THEIR LITTLE JIZZ JOKES.

17:22.207 --> 17:22.808
THEIR PARENTS COULDN'T BE

17:22.875 --> 17:24.943
PROUDER.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.311
HEY, CHRISSY, DID YOU LIKE

17:26.378 --> 17:34.153
HEARING ME SAY YOUR MCGRUFF DOG

17:34.219 --> 17:34.920
JERKING IT JOKE, I BET YOU DID

17:34.987 --> 17:35.387
YOU COLLEGE GRADUATE?

17:35.454 --> 17:36.054
BUT THE FACT REPORTERS WILL ECHO

17:36.121 --> 17:36.588
PIO'S DOES EXPLAIN CERTAIN

17:36.655 --> 17:38.357
THINGS -- LIKE THE UBIQUITY OF

17:38.424 --> 17:39.691
PHRASES LIKE "OFFICER-INVOLVED

17:39.758 --> 17:42.594
SHOOTING."

17:42.661 --> 17:43.195
YOU SEE IT IN POLICE ACCOUNTS

17:43.262 --> 17:44.363
ALL THE TIME, BUT IT'S A WEIRD

17:44.430 --> 17:45.264
TERM FOR REPORTERS TO REPEAT,

17:45.330 --> 17:47.332
BECAUSE IT DELIBERATELY OMITS

17:47.399 --> 17:48.167
CRUCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW

17:48.233 --> 17:50.702
THE OFFICER WAS INVOLVED.

17:50.769 --> 17:51.737
IF YOU WENT TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE

17:51.804 --> 17:53.305
FOR DINNER AND THEY SAID

17:53.372 --> 17:54.173
"TONIGHT, THERE IS A

17:54.239 --> 17:56.074
RAT-INVOLVED DINNER," YOU'D

17:56.141 --> 17:57.342
JUSTIFIABLY HAVE FOLLOW UP

17:57.409 --> 17:57.943
QUESTIONS.

17:58.010 --> 17:58.777
ARE WE GOING TO A

17:58.844 --> 18:00.012
CHUCK E. CHEESE?

18:00.078 --> 18:01.447
IS THE CHEF BEING CONTROLLED BY

18:01.513 --> 18:03.348
A TINY FRENCH RAT UNDER HIS HAT?

18:03.415 --> 18:08.387
OR ARE WE GOING TO BE ON AN

18:08.454 --> 18:09.588
EPISODE OF "KITCHEN NIGHTMARES?"

18:09.655 --> 18:10.122
ALL THREE ARE TECHNICALLY

18:10.189 --> 18:10.756
"RAT-INVOLVED", BUT SOME OPTIONS

18:10.823 --> 18:11.323
ARE EASIER TO LIVE WITH THAN

18:11.390 --> 18:11.757
OTHERS.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.392
AND HONESTLY, POLICE DEPARTMENTS

18:13.459 --> 18:14.493
DON'T ALWAYS NEED A PIO TO PUSH

18:14.560 --> 18:15.527
THEIR NARRATIVE, AS OUTLETS WILL

18:15.594 --> 18:17.796
SOMETIMES JUST GRAB SHIT FROM A

18:17.863 --> 18:18.764
LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCY'S SOCIAL

18:18.831 --> 18:20.132
MEDIA.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.067
FOR INSTANCE, POLICE LOVE

18:22.134 --> 18:24.336
POSTING EVIDENCE FROM BUSTS

18:24.403 --> 18:25.704
THEY'VE CONDUCTED LIKE THIS ONE,

18:25.771 --> 18:26.805
WHICH A TEXAS NEWS STATION NOT

18:26.872 --> 18:28.607
ONLY SHARED ON THEIR OWN

18:28.674 --> 18:29.741
FACEBOOK PAGE, BUT EVEN INCLUDED

18:29.808 --> 18:31.777
ON THEIR EVENING BROADCAST.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.011
>> A SEARCH WARRANT EXECUTED

18:33.078 --> 18:33.745
MONDAY HAS LEFT THREE PEOPLE

18:33.812 --> 18:35.180
BEHIND BARS.

18:35.247 --> 18:36.315
THE TENAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS

18:36.381 --> 18:37.049
RELEASED INFORMATION ON THE

18:37.115 --> 18:38.517
RAID.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.486
>> AMONG THE ITEMS SEIZED WERE

18:40.552 --> 18:42.688
TWO POUNDS OF MARIJUANA,

18:42.754 --> 18:44.356
ILLEGALLY POSSESSED PRESCRIPTION

18:44.423 --> 18:46.058
PILLS, DRUG PARAPHERNALIA,

18:46.125 --> 18:47.626
PACKAGING MATERIALS, GUNS, AND

18:47.693 --> 18:48.460
CASH.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.329
>> John: NOW, IF YOU DON'T

18:50.395 --> 18:50.963
REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE

18:51.029 --> 18:51.563
LOOKING AT THERE, I GUESS THAT

18:51.630 --> 18:52.764
SEEMS LIKE A STORY.

18:52.831 --> 18:55.567
BUT IS IT?

18:55.634 --> 18:57.102
BECAUSE, AS MANY QUICKLY POINTED

18:57.169 --> 18:58.136
OUT, WHEN YOU EXAMINE THE PHOTO,

18:58.203 --> 18:59.471
YOU REALIZE, NOT ONLY IS THAT

18:59.538 --> 19:02.074
NOT A LOT OF DRUGS, THERE'S WAY

19:02.140 --> 19:03.275
LESS CASH THERE THAN THEY'RE

19:03.342 --> 19:04.376
GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE

19:04.443 --> 19:05.844
IT LOOK.

19:05.911 --> 19:09.014
MOST OF THOSE ARE SINGLES.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.383
THAT'S $70, TOTAL.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.551
ONE COMMENTER ON THE STATION'S

19:12.618 --> 19:13.919
POST SAID, "SICK.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.087
THIS IS PLAYSKOOL'S MY FIRST

19:15.153 --> 19:17.089
DEALER SET," WITH ANOTHER

19:17.155 --> 19:18.190
ADDING, "WHO WAS THE DRUG

19:18.257 --> 19:21.093
DEALER, EL CHEAPO?"

19:21.159 --> 19:22.628
AND THAT SPEAKS TO THE FACT

19:22.694 --> 19:25.998
THERE CAN BE A GAP -- SOMETIMES

19:26.064 --> 19:26.732
SMALL, BUT SOMETIMES MASSIVE --

19:26.798 --> 19:28.800
BETWEEN "THE STORY POLICE ARE

19:28.867 --> 19:29.468
TELLING EVERYONE" AND "THE STORY

19:29.535 --> 19:31.303
THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED."

19:31.370 --> 19:32.671
BECAUSE COPS' STORIES CAN, FOR A

19:32.738 --> 19:33.305
LOT OF REASONS, TURN OUT TO BE

19:33.372 --> 19:35.107
WRONG, IN WAYS BOTH SERIOUS, AND

19:35.173 --> 19:37.543
INCREDIBLY PETTY.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.011
TAKE THE TREND OF COPS CLAIMING

19:39.077 --> 19:39.811
MISTREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF

19:39.878 --> 19:41.547
FAST-FOOD EMPLOYEES, WHICH LOCAL

19:41.613 --> 19:45.050
NEWS CAN BE ONLY HAPPY TO GOBBLE

19:45.117 --> 19:46.485
RIGHT UP.

19:46.552 --> 19:47.853
>> A POSSIBLE HATE CRIME AGAINST

19:47.920 --> 19:49.254
POLICE IS BEING INVESTIGATED

19:49.321 --> 19:51.189
RIGHT NOW AT A SHAKE SHACK IN

19:51.256 --> 19:53.425
DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.160
SOURCES TELL CBS 2, THREE

19:55.227 --> 19:56.428
OFFICERS BECAME SICK AFTER

19:56.495 --> 19:57.696
HAVING SHAKES FROM THE

19:57.763 --> 19:59.698
RESTAURANT TONIGHT.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.166
POLICE SUSPECT AN EMPLOYEE MAY

20:01.233 --> 20:02.434
HAVE CONTAMINATED THE DRINKS

20:02.501 --> 20:04.937
WITH BLEACH.

20:05.003 --> 20:06.204
>> THE LAYTON POLICE SERGEANT

20:06.271 --> 20:08.006
ORDERED A SUB AND A LEMONADE

20:08.073 --> 20:09.174
FROM THIS SUBWAY.

20:09.241 --> 20:10.909
BUT AFTER TAKING A FEW SIPS OF

20:10.976 --> 20:12.744
HIS DRINK, HE QUICKLY FOUND OUT

20:12.811 --> 20:14.212
HE GOT MUCH MORE THAN WHAT HE

20:14.279 --> 20:15.147
PAID FOR.

20:15.213 --> 20:16.181
>> HE WAS HAVING A HARD TIME

20:16.248 --> 20:16.949
MAINTAINING HIS BODY.

20:17.015 --> 20:18.250
HIS BODY WAS JERKING.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.217
>> WHAT CAUSED THOSE SIDE

20:19.284 --> 20:21.253
EFFECTS, POLICE SAY, TURNED OUT

20:21.320 --> 20:22.187
TO BE A DOUBLE DOSE OF ILLEGAL

20:22.254 --> 20:23.055
NARCOTICS.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.157
>> DJ, A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

20:25.223 --> 20:27.225
OFFICER TOLD EYEWITNESS NEWS HE

20:27.292 --> 20:30.162
SUSPECTS SOMEONE AT MCDONALD'S

20:30.228 --> 20:32.698
TOOK A BITE FROM HIS SANDWICH

20:32.764 --> 20:34.666
BEFORE HE COMPLETED THE SALE.

20:34.733 --> 20:35.534
>> TONIGHT A MCDONALD'S IN

20:35.601 --> 20:36.635
JUNCTION CITY IS INVESTIGATING

20:36.702 --> 20:37.970
AFTER A POLICE OFFICER FOUND

20:38.036 --> 20:39.338
INSULTING WORDS WRITTEN ON HIS

20:39.404 --> 20:40.305
COFFEE.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.074
THE F WORD HAS BEEN BLURRED OUT

20:42.140 --> 20:43.976
IN THIS IMAGE OF COURSE BUT, YOU

20:44.042 --> 20:44.643
CAN SEE THE WORD PIG WRITTEN

20:44.710 --> 20:45.911
RIGHT BELOW IT.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.446
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT

20:47.512 --> 20:48.313
THERE, BUT REAL QUICK: THERE WAS

20:48.380 --> 20:49.982
NO BLEACH IN THE SHAKES, NO

20:50.048 --> 20:51.149
DRUGS IN THE LEMONADE, THE COP

20:51.216 --> 20:52.818
WITH THE SANDWICH LATER ADMITTED

20:52.884 --> 20:53.952
HE'D SIMPLY FORGOTTEN HE TOOK A

20:54.019 --> 20:55.988
BITE FROM IT, AND THE ONE WITH

20:56.054 --> 20:57.422
THE COFFEE ADMITTED HE'D WRITTEN

20:57.489 --> 21:02.260
"FUCKING PIG" ON HIS OWN CUP.

21:02.327 --> 21:02.861
WHICH IS A SERIOUS ACT OF

21:02.928 --> 21:03.629
SELF-LOATHING, UNLESS YOU'RE

21:03.695 --> 21:06.031
MISS PIGGY, IN WHICH CASE IT'S A

21:06.098 --> 21:08.533
SLAY.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.468
OUTTA THE WAY BOYS, SHE'S GOT

21:09.534 --> 21:10.202
FASHION TO WERK AND FROG DICK TO

21:10.268 --> 21:10.802
SLURP.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.571
WHO'S COFFEE IS THAT?

21:12.638 --> 21:15.440
IT'S THIS FUCKING PIG'S.

21:15.507 --> 21:16.875
AND THAT SPEAKS TO ONE OF THE

21:16.942 --> 21:18.410
MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH DEFERRING TO

21:18.477 --> 21:20.445
POLICE.

21:20.512 --> 21:21.513
BECAUSE -- AS MANY OF YOU HAVE

21:21.580 --> 21:22.848
UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN YELLING AT YOUR

21:22.914 --> 21:25.751
TV, LIKE I'M A WHEEL OF FORTUNE

21:25.817 --> 21:26.318
CONTESTANT WHO CAN'T SOLVE THE

21:26.385 --> 21:28.887
PUZZLE -- POLICE LIE, AND THEY

21:28.954 --> 21:29.988
LIE A LOT.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.056
AS YOU'VE SEEN ON THIS SHOW,

21:31.123 --> 21:33.291
THEY'VE LIED TO GET SEARCH

21:33.358 --> 21:34.192
WARRANTS TO CONDUCT RAIDS AND TO

21:34.259 --> 21:35.360
GET CONFESSIONS DURING

21:35.427 --> 21:37.429
INTERROGATIONS, AND THEY EVEN

21:37.496 --> 21:39.931
LIE UNDER OATH -- SO OFTEN THAT,

21:39.998 --> 21:41.333
HERE IN NEW YORK, IT CAME TO BE

21:41.400 --> 21:43.802
KNOWN AS "TESTILYING."

21:43.869 --> 21:45.003
ALL OF WHICH SHOULD BE MORE THAN

21:45.070 --> 21:45.804
ENOUGH FOR "THE WORD OF THE

21:45.871 --> 21:47.272
POLICE" TO BE TREATED WITH

21:47.339 --> 21:48.440
IMMENSE SKEPTICISM, RATHER THAN

21:48.507 --> 21:50.976
REPEATED VERBATIM.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.544
TAKE THE NOTORIOUS PRESS RELEASE

21:52.611 --> 21:55.313
MINNEAPOLIS POLICE PUT OUT

21:55.380 --> 21:57.182
FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF GEORGE

21:57.249 --> 21:58.116
FLOYD TITLED "MAN DIES AFTER

21:58.183 --> 21:59.384
MEDICAL INCIDENT DURING POLICE

21:59.451 --> 22:00.519
INTERACTION."

22:00.585 --> 22:02.120
WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS, IT WAS

22:02.187 --> 22:05.490
PICKED UP ALMOST WORD FOR WORD

22:05.557 --> 22:10.696
BY LOCAL NEWS THE NEXT MORNING.

22:10.762 --> 22:11.363
>> WE DO BEGIN THIS MORNING WITH

22:11.430 --> 22:11.963
DEVELOPING NEWS.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.699
A MAN IS DEAD AFTER WHAT POLICE

22:13.765 --> 22:14.299
ARE CALLING A MEDICAL DISTRESS

22:14.366 --> 22:14.800
AFTER BEING HANDCUFFED.

22:14.866 --> 22:15.600
NOW, OFFICERS WERE RESPONDING TO

22:15.667 --> 22:17.469
A FORGERY IN PROGRESS.

22:17.536 --> 22:18.804
IT HAPPENED ON THE 3700 BLOCK OF

22:18.870 --> 22:20.739
CHICAGO AVENUE SOUTH.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.607
WHEN THEY ARRIVED, OFFICERS

22:22.674 --> 22:23.508
FOUND A MAN THEY BELIEVED TO BE

22:23.575 --> 22:24.309
THE SUSPECT SITTING INSIDE A

22:24.376 --> 22:25.711
CAR.

22:25.777 --> 22:26.678
THEY APPARENTLY TOLD HIM TO GET

22:26.745 --> 22:27.979
OUT.

22:28.046 --> 22:28.747
HE RESISTED.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.615
OFFICERS EVENTUALLY GOT HIM

22:30.682 --> 22:31.817
HANDCUFFED, WHICH IS WHEN HE

22:31.883 --> 22:33.118
APPEARED TO HAVE THE MEDICAL

22:33.185 --> 22:34.052
ISSUE.

22:34.119 --> 22:35.854
THE SUSPECT WAS TAKEN TO THE

22:35.921 --> 22:36.755
HOSPITAL, WHERE HE DIED A SHORT

22:36.822 --> 22:37.989
TIME LATER.

22:38.056 --> 22:40.092
>> John: NOW, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S

22:40.158 --> 22:40.826
A HUGELY SELF-SERVING STATEMENT

22:40.892 --> 22:41.793
FROM THE POLICE.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.361
BECAUSE BY SAYING "GEORGE FLOYD

22:43.428 --> 22:45.530
DIED BECAUSE OF MEDICAL

22:45.597 --> 22:46.898
DISTRESS," THEIR ROLE WAS

22:46.965 --> 22:48.633
COMPLETELY ERASED.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.968
HIS "MEDICAL DISTRESS" -- AND

22:50.035 --> 22:51.737
I'M USING THE BIGGEST AIR QUOTES

22:51.803 --> 22:53.371
HUMANLY POSSIBLE -- WAS THE

22:53.438 --> 22:54.539
RESULT OF AN OFFICER PRESSING

22:54.606 --> 22:56.274
HIS KNEE INTO HIS NECK FOR NINE

22:56.341 --> 22:57.743
MINUTES.

22:57.809 --> 22:58.910
REPEATING THAT CLAIM BY THE

22:58.977 --> 23:00.545
POLICE IS AN ACT OF MALPRACTICE

23:00.612 --> 23:02.280
AKIN TO WALTER CRONKITE SAYING,

23:02.347 --> 23:04.282
"JFK DIED OF A HEADACHE TODAY."

23:04.349 --> 23:05.784
SURE, IT'S NOT "TECHNICALLY"

23:05.851 --> 23:06.618
WRONG, BUT IT'S THE

23:06.685 --> 23:08.320
UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE FUCKING

23:08.386 --> 23:11.156
CENTURY.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.390
THE POINT IS, IT WAS ONLY AFTER

23:12.457 --> 23:13.792
THE RELEASE OF CELL PHONE

23:13.859 --> 23:14.860
FOOTAGE RECORDED BY A BRAVE

23:14.926 --> 23:15.727
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, THAT

23:15.794 --> 23:16.361
THAT POLICE NARRATIVE FELL

23:16.428 --> 23:17.929
APART.

23:17.996 --> 23:18.964
OTHERWISE, THAT BULLSHIT PRESS

23:19.030 --> 23:20.532
RELEASE MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN THE

23:20.599 --> 23:21.967
VERSION OF EVENTS THAT EVERYBODY

23:22.033 --> 23:23.068
HEARD.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.303
AND THAT'S NOT A ONE-OFF.

23:25.370 --> 23:26.338
AN INVESTIGATION LAST YEAR OF

23:26.404 --> 23:27.639
POLICE KILLINGS IN CALIFORNIA,

23:27.706 --> 23:29.241
FOUND AT LEAST A DOZEN EXAMPLES

23:29.307 --> 23:30.776
OF INITIAL POLICE STATEMENTS

23:30.842 --> 23:33.745
MISREPRESENTING EVENTS, WITH

23:33.812 --> 23:35.580
REPORTS CITING "VAGUE MEDICAL

23:35.647 --> 23:37.415
EMERGENCIES WITHOUT DISCLOSING

23:37.482 --> 23:38.984
THAT OFFICERS HAD CAUSED THE

23:39.050 --> 23:39.718
EMERGENCIES THROUGH THEIR USE OF

23:39.785 --> 23:40.585
FORCE."

23:40.652 --> 23:42.621
AND "IN MOST INSTANCES, MEDIA

23:42.687 --> 23:44.756
OUTLETS REPEATED THE POLICE

23:44.823 --> 23:45.357
VERSION OF EVENTS WITH LITTLE

23:45.423 --> 23:46.424
SKEPTICISM."

23:46.491 --> 23:49.361
WHICH ISN'T GOOD!

23:49.427 --> 23:50.996
THERE'S A TIME AND A PLACE FOR

23:51.062 --> 23:52.697
MEDIA OUTLETS TO OPERATE WITHOUT

23:52.764 --> 23:55.367
SKEPTICISM, AND IT'S THE COVER

23:55.433 --> 23:56.635
OF HEALTH MAGAZINES -- NOT AN

23:56.701 --> 23:57.903
OUNCE OF CRITICAL THINKING ON

23:57.969 --> 24:00.172
THIS EXTREMELY REAL COVER THAT

24:00.238 --> 24:01.973
INCLUDES THE HEADLINES "LOSE 9

24:02.040 --> 24:03.608
WAIST INCHES IN 21 DAYS" AND

24:03.675 --> 24:05.677
"NEWS!

24:05.744 --> 24:06.778
A POTATO A DAY UPS WEIGHT LOSS

24:06.845 --> 24:08.747
BY 340%!"

24:08.814 --> 24:10.282
THAT'S ROCK SOLID SCIENCE,

24:10.348 --> 24:12.217
PRESUMABLY!

24:12.284 --> 24:15.320
AND THERE ARE TIMES WHERE THE

24:15.387 --> 24:16.188
TRUST REPORTERS PLACE IN SOME

24:16.254 --> 24:17.355
POLICE SOURCES HAS BEEN

24:17.422 --> 24:19.591
PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS.

24:19.658 --> 24:22.761
JUST TAKE WHAT HAPPENED IN

24:22.828 --> 24:24.362
CHICAGO, AFTER THE POLICE SHOT

24:24.429 --> 24:25.463
TEENAGER LAQUAN MCDONALD SIXTEEN

24:25.530 --> 24:25.964
TIMES.

24:26.031 --> 24:26.498
IN THEIR INITIAL COVERAGE,

24:26.565 --> 24:28.033
MULTIPLE LOCAL OUTLETS FEATURED

24:28.099 --> 24:29.100
INTERVIEWS WITH ONE PERSON ON

24:29.167 --> 24:32.003
THE SCENE, WHOSE VERSION OF

24:32.070 --> 24:32.971
EVENTS HEAVILY FAVORED THE

24:33.038 --> 24:33.205
POLICE.

24:33.271 --> 24:34.639
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS MENTAL

24:34.706 --> 24:36.174
STATE WAS, BUT HE WASN'T

24:36.241 --> 24:37.309
DROPPING THE KNIFE AND HE WAS

24:37.375 --> 24:39.344
COMING AT THE OFFICER.

24:39.411 --> 24:39.945
YOU OBVIOUSLY AREN'T GOING TO

24:40.011 --> 24:40.912
SIT DOWN AND HAVE A CUP OF

24:40.979 --> 24:42.848
COFFEE WITH HIM.

24:42.914 --> 24:45.650
HE IS A VERY SERIOUS THREAT TO

24:45.717 --> 24:47.886
THE OFFICERS, AND HE LEAVES THEM

24:47.953 --> 24:49.120
NO CHOICE AT THAT POINT BUT TO

24:49.187 --> 24:51.223
DEFEND THEMSELVES.

24:51.289 --> 24:52.657
>> John: WELL, THAT'S A VERY

24:52.724 --> 24:53.859
DETAILED PICTURE PAINTED BY PALM

24:53.925 --> 24:56.294
BEACH POTATO HEAD THERE, BUT A

24:56.361 --> 24:58.096
FEW THINGS: FIRST, WHILE HE

24:58.163 --> 24:59.164
SOUNDS LIKE AN EYEWITNESS, HE

24:59.231 --> 25:01.466
WASN'T THERE.

25:01.533 --> 25:02.367
SECOND, VIDEOTAPE LATER REVEALED

25:02.434 --> 25:06.204
THAT THE STORY HE WAS TELLING

25:06.271 --> 25:06.938
WAS COMPLETE HORSESHIT -- POLICE

25:07.005 --> 25:08.807
SHOT MACDONALD WHEN HE WAS

25:08.874 --> 25:09.674
WALKING AWAY FROM THEM.

25:09.741 --> 25:10.442
BUT FINALLY, REPORTERS SHOULD'VE

25:10.508 --> 25:12.077
KNOWN TO TAKE ANYTHING THAT GUY

25:12.143 --> 25:13.478
SAID WITH A MASSIVE GRAIN OF

25:13.545 --> 25:15.547
SALT, BECAUSE PAT CAMDEN IS THE

25:15.614 --> 25:17.148
SPOKESPERSON FOR THE CHICAGO

25:17.215 --> 25:18.850
FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE, WHICH

25:18.917 --> 25:21.086
FUNCTIONS AS PART POLICE UNION,

25:21.152 --> 25:21.853
PART SPECIAL INTEREST LOBBY

25:21.920 --> 25:23.288
GROUP.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.689
HIS ONLY AGENDA IS TO PROTECT

25:24.756 --> 25:26.258
COPS.

25:26.324 --> 25:27.259
AND IT WAS WAY TOO EASY FOR THIS

25:27.325 --> 25:29.227
LIL MUSTACHIO'D WEIRDO TO HEAR

25:29.294 --> 25:30.462
THERE WAS A SHOOTING, DRIVE TO

25:30.528 --> 25:31.963
THE SCENE, JUMP IN FRONT OF

25:32.030 --> 25:33.365
CAMERAS AND GRAB CONTROL OF THE

25:33.431 --> 25:34.199
NARRATIVE.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.601
AND CAMDEN DOES THIS A LOT --

25:36.668 --> 25:38.570
ONE ANALYSIS FOUND THAT IN A

25:38.637 --> 25:39.938
FOUR-YEAR TIMESPAN, HE PROVIDED

25:40.005 --> 25:41.306
AN INITIAL VERSION OF EVENTS FOR

25:41.373 --> 25:43.375
35 POLICE SHOOTINGS.

25:43.441 --> 25:45.577
AND IN 15 CASES, CRUCIAL ASPECTS

25:45.644 --> 25:46.645
OF HIS STATEMENTS WERE LATER

25:46.711 --> 25:48.280
PROVED TO BE FALSE OR

25:48.346 --> 25:51.316
MISLEADING.

25:51.383 --> 25:51.917
WHICH IS JUST WILD.

25:51.983 --> 25:53.518
IF YOU GET CAUGHT CHEATING AT

25:53.585 --> 25:55.620
ONE CASINO, THEY BAN YOU FROM

25:55.687 --> 25:56.121
EVERY CASINO.

25:56.187 --> 25:57.289
THIS GUY'S PEDDLED BULLSHIT TO

25:57.355 --> 25:59.491
THE PRESS 15 TIMES, YET SOMEHOW

25:59.557 --> 26:01.192
HIS PICTURE ISN'T PINNED BEHIND

26:01.259 --> 26:02.560
EVERY NEWS DESK IN THE COUNTRY,

26:02.627 --> 26:04.763
WITH THE WARNING "DO NOT ASK

26:04.829 --> 26:08.400
THIS MAN ABOUT ANYTHING."

26:08.466 --> 26:10.502
SO, SO, SO OFTEN, IT SEEMS LIKE

26:10.568 --> 26:12.137
NEWS OUTLETS WOULD BE SERVING

26:12.203 --> 26:13.138
THEIR COMMUNITIES MUCH BETTER IF

26:13.204 --> 26:14.706
THEY WEREN'T QUITE SO TRUSTING

26:14.773 --> 26:15.974
WHEN IT CAME TO WHAT POLICE TELL

26:16.041 --> 26:17.008
THEM.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.076
TO SEE A LOT OF WHAT I'VE TALKED

26:18.143 --> 26:20.412
ABOUT TONIGHT IN ONE PLACE, TAKE

26:20.478 --> 26:21.546
WHAT HAPPENED IN BROOKSIDE,

26:21.613 --> 26:22.580
ALABAMA, WHERE A FEW YEARS AGO,

26:22.647 --> 26:24.416
LOCAL NEWS WAS EXCITEDLY

26:24.482 --> 26:25.684
REPORTING ON A NEW INITIATIVE

26:25.750 --> 26:27.152
FROM THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT,

26:27.218 --> 26:28.520
WHICH "POLICE SAID" WAS GETTING

26:28.586 --> 26:30.488
REAL RESULTS.

26:30.555 --> 26:31.856
>> WE TELL YOU STORIES ALL THE

26:31.923 --> 26:33.959
TIME ABOUT CRIME GOING UP, BUT

26:34.025 --> 26:34.759
WE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS: THE TOWN

26:34.826 --> 26:36.695
OF BROOKSIDE SAYS THEY'RE SEEING

26:36.761 --> 26:37.796
CRIME GO DOWN.

26:37.862 --> 26:39.597
>> BROOKSIDE IS NOT A BIG TOWN,

26:39.664 --> 26:40.832
BUT ITS NARCOTICS INTERDICTION

26:40.899 --> 26:41.433
TEAM?

26:41.499 --> 26:43.134
THEY'VE BEEN BUSY.

26:43.201 --> 26:43.902
>> ANOTHER DRUG BUST THIS

26:43.969 --> 26:45.470
WEEKEND ON I-22.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.105
>> AND THE BROOKSIDE POLICE HAVE

26:47.172 --> 26:48.173
BEEN SO BUSY.

26:48.239 --> 26:49.574
>> OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO NOT

26:49.641 --> 26:50.709
PROSECUTE PEOPLE.

26:50.775 --> 26:51.710
IT'S TO SAVE LIVES.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.411
THAT'S WHY WE GOT INTO THIS.

26:53.478 --> 26:54.079
WE WANT TO SAVE LIVES.

26:54.145 --> 26:54.813
WE WANT TO KEEP OUR CITIZENS

26:54.879 --> 26:56.081
SAFE.

26:56.147 --> 26:58.116
WE WANT TO KEEP PEOPLE WHO ARE

26:58.183 --> 26:58.883
COMING TO BROOKSIDE SAFE AND

26:58.950 --> 26:59.951
ENJOY OUR TOWN.

27:00.018 --> 27:00.986
>> John: ALL THAT COVERAGE IS

27:01.052 --> 27:02.387
JUST SO WEIRD.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.589
IT'S PART LOCAL NEWS FLUFF, PART

27:04.656 --> 27:05.790
PROPAGANDA, AND SOMETHING

27:05.857 --> 27:07.292
BORDERING ON A TOURISM AD FROM

27:07.359 --> 27:09.361
OFFICER TEDDY RUXPIN THERE.

27:09.427 --> 27:10.862
BUT THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S A BIT

27:10.929 --> 27:12.964
STRANGE THAT ONE TINY TOWN IN

27:13.031 --> 27:14.232
ALABAMA HAD SUDDENLY BECOME A

27:14.299 --> 27:14.766
HOTBED FOR DRUG SMUGGLING,

27:14.833 --> 27:16.768
RIGHT?

27:16.835 --> 27:19.237
WELL, IT TURNS OUT, YES.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.039
AND I WILL SAY, TO ITS CREDIT,

27:21.106 --> 27:22.307
ONE LOCAL STATION DID DIG A

27:22.374 --> 27:23.775
LITTLE DEEPER, AIRING A REPORT

27:23.842 --> 27:25.143
ABOUT THE FACT A WEIRD AMOUNT OF

27:25.210 --> 27:26.745
DRIVERS WERE QUESTIONING THE

27:26.811 --> 27:27.379
TICKETS WRITTEN BY THAT POLICE

27:27.445 --> 27:27.846
DEPARTMENT.

27:27.912 --> 27:29.614
A STORY, INCIDENTALLY, THAT LED

27:29.681 --> 27:31.016
THAT DEPARTMENT TO TELL

27:31.082 --> 27:32.250
EMPLOYEES THAT ANYONE TALKING TO

27:32.317 --> 27:34.986
THAT REPORTER WOULD BE FIRED.

27:35.053 --> 27:36.821
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO YEARS

27:36.888 --> 27:38.656
LATER THAT AN IN-DEPTH

27:38.723 --> 27:39.791
INVESTIGATION FROM AL.COM

27:39.858 --> 27:41.092
REVEALED WHAT HAD ACTUALLY BEEN

27:41.159 --> 27:42.594
HAPPENING, THAT IS THAT

27:42.660 --> 27:44.529
BROOKSIDE -- A TOWN OF JUST

27:44.596 --> 27:45.196
1,200 PEOPLE -- WAS HAVING ITS

27:45.263 --> 27:47.565
FINANCES ROCKET-FUELED BY

27:47.632 --> 27:49.134
TICKETS AND AGGRESSIVE POLICING,

27:49.200 --> 27:50.635
WITH BULLSHIT TRAFFIC TICKETS

27:50.702 --> 27:51.302
BEING ISSUED AT A TRULY

27:51.369 --> 27:52.771
RIDICULOUS RATE.

27:52.837 --> 27:53.905
>> BROOKSIDE DRAGGED SO MANY

27:53.972 --> 27:55.006
PEOPLE INTO COURT THAT POLICE

27:55.073 --> 27:56.241
HAD TO DIRECT TRAFFIC ON COURT

27:56.307 --> 27:57.642
DAYS.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.044
MONEY FROM FINES AND FORFEITURE

27:59.110 --> 28:01.713
SOARED MORE THAN 600% TO THE

28:01.780 --> 28:02.981
POINT WHERE IT MADE UP HALF THE

28:03.048 --> 28:04.516
TOWN BUDGET.

28:04.582 --> 28:05.850
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

28:05.917 --> 28:07.185
IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THE

28:07.252 --> 28:09.254
POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS TAKING IN

28:09.320 --> 28:11.756
$487 FOR EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND

28:11.823 --> 28:12.991
CHILD, AND SPENDING IT ON, AMONG

28:13.058 --> 28:14.492
OTHER THINGS, A SWAT TEAM, A

28:14.559 --> 28:16.194
JAIL, A FLEET OF UNMARKED CARS,

28:16.261 --> 28:20.732
AND TWO DRUG-SNIFFING DOGS --

28:20.799 --> 28:21.299
ONE OF WHICH THEY NAMED, AND

28:21.366 --> 28:22.834
THIS IS TRUE, K-9 CASH.

28:22.901 --> 28:25.770
HERE IS THAT DOG.

28:25.837 --> 28:27.505
AND I WILL SAY, HE DOES LOOK

28:27.572 --> 28:28.239
LIKE A K-9 CASH.

28:28.306 --> 28:29.207
AND THAT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT.

28:29.274 --> 28:30.742
BAD DOG.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.110
BUT THE POINT IS, WHAT WAS

28:32.177 --> 28:33.278
ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN BROOKSIDE

28:33.344 --> 28:34.212
TURNED OUT TO BE A PRETTY FAR

28:34.279 --> 28:35.513
CRY FROM THE INITIAL COVERAGE

28:35.580 --> 28:37.215
OF, "HEY, GREAT NEWS, THIS SMALL

28:37.282 --> 28:38.149
TOWN POLICE FORCE IS APPARENTLY

28:38.216 --> 28:39.818
MIAMI VICE ALL OF A SUDDEN.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.487
ANYWAY, NO FURTHER QUESTIONS."

28:42.554 --> 28:44.489
AND THE THING IS, BY PRESENTING

28:44.556 --> 28:45.423
POLICE UNCRITICALLY, YOU'RE NOT

28:45.490 --> 28:46.524
JUST HELPING THEM DODGE

28:46.591 --> 28:47.859
ACCOUNTABILITY -- YOU'RE GIVING

28:47.926 --> 28:50.161
THEM A HUGE LOBBYING PLATFORM.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.663
RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

28:51.729 --> 28:53.398
LOOK FAR TO FIND COPS ON TV,

28:53.465 --> 28:54.532
SUGGESTING THE FIX FOR ANY RISE

28:54.599 --> 28:57.035
IN CRIME IS TO UNDO THE CRIMINAL

28:57.102 --> 28:58.136
JUSTICE REFORMS OF THE PAST FEW

28:58.203 --> 28:59.604
YEARS, AND TO GIVE THEM MORE

28:59.671 --> 29:00.905
MONEY.

29:00.972 --> 29:02.774
AND THIS CAN GET REAL RESULTS.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.410
EVEN THE CURRENT RAINBOW

29:05.477 --> 29:07.212
FENTANYL SCARE STARTED WITH A

29:07.278 --> 29:08.680
DEA PRESS RELEASE, WHICH

29:08.746 --> 29:10.582
HAPPENED TO DROP JUST AS

29:10.648 --> 29:12.183
CONGRESS WAS IN THE MIDST OF

29:12.250 --> 29:13.118
BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS.

29:13.184 --> 29:14.786
EVERYONE PICKED UP THAT STORY,

29:14.853 --> 29:16.654
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK,

29:16.721 --> 29:17.489
CHUCK SCHUMER ANNOUNCED HIS

29:17.555 --> 29:19.424
INTENTION TO ALLOCATE NEARLY 300

29:19.491 --> 29:21.192
MILLION MORE DOLLARS TO LAW

29:21.259 --> 29:22.427
ENFORCEMENT, SO THEY CAN FIGHT

29:22.494 --> 29:25.130
THE SCOURGE OF RAINBOW FENTANYL.

29:25.196 --> 29:26.831
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING ALL

29:26.898 --> 29:27.866
CRIME REPORTING IS BAD.

29:27.932 --> 29:28.500
THERE'S SOME INCREDIBLE COVERAGE

29:28.566 --> 29:30.068
OUT THERE.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.836
WE FEATURE IT ON THIS SHOW ALL

29:31.903 --> 29:33.705
THE TIME, AND A LOT OF WHAT I

29:33.771 --> 29:35.473
TOLD YOU TONIGHT, CAME FROM

29:35.540 --> 29:39.577
GREAT INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING.

29:39.644 --> 29:40.178
BUT THE DAILY CRIME BEAT,

29:40.245 --> 29:40.812
WHETHER FROM LACK OF RESOURCES,

29:40.879 --> 29:41.880
LACK OF SCRUTINY, OR LACK OF

29:41.946 --> 29:42.747
FOLLOW-THROUGH, FAR TOO OFTEN,

29:42.814 --> 29:43.381
TAKES POLICE AT THEIR WORD, AND

29:43.448 --> 29:47.152
NOT AS AN INTEREST GROUP WHO

29:47.218 --> 29:49.187
SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH.

29:49.254 --> 29:50.121
SO, WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN HERE?

29:50.188 --> 29:51.656
WELL, THE POLICE COULD CHANGE

29:51.723 --> 29:52.624
THE WAYS THEY BOTH BEHAVE AND

29:52.690 --> 29:53.992
COMMUNICATE.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.126
BUT GIVEN THAT'S NOT GOING TO

29:55.193 --> 29:57.562
HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON, IT

29:57.629 --> 29:58.196
UNFORTUNATELY FALLS TO THE REST

29:58.263 --> 29:59.097
OF US.

29:59.164 --> 30:00.665
FOR NEWS OUTLETS, THEY COULD TRY

30:00.732 --> 30:02.066
AND SNAP OUT OF THEIR AUTOMATIC

30:02.133 --> 30:04.202
DEFERENCE TO POLICE.

30:04.269 --> 30:05.303
WHICH IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE --

30:05.370 --> 30:06.104
JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN A

30:06.171 --> 30:08.306
POLITICAL WEB SERIES FROM THE

30:08.373 --> 30:10.008
HILL INVITED ON A PUBLIC

30:10.074 --> 30:11.075
DEFENDER TO DISCUSS THE CASE OF

30:11.142 --> 30:11.776
JAYLAND WALKER, WHO WAS KILLED

30:11.843 --> 30:13.178
BY POLICE AFTER FLEEING A

30:13.244 --> 30:14.312
TRAFFIC STOP.

30:14.379 --> 30:16.381
WATCH HER PUSH BACK WHEN THE

30:16.447 --> 30:17.916
HOST SEEMS A LITTLE TOO EAGER TO

30:17.982 --> 30:19.851
ACCEPT THE POLICE LINE.

30:19.918 --> 30:21.119
>> THERE'S NO WORLD, NO TRAFFIC

30:21.186 --> 30:22.353
INFRACTION, THE PUNISHMENT IS

30:22.420 --> 30:23.621
DEATH, NOT A ONE, NEVER.

30:23.688 --> 30:25.657
SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY EIGHT

30:25.723 --> 30:26.691
OFFICERS SHOULD CHOOSE TO GO AND

30:26.758 --> 30:28.426
SHOOT HIM TO DEATH.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.327
>> I -- I GUESS I -- I JUST

30:29.394 --> 30:30.094
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY IN

30:30.161 --> 30:31.429
THIS PARTICULAR CASE, ALTHOUGH I

30:31.496 --> 30:31.930
DO --

30:31.996 --> 30:32.931
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

30:32.997 --> 30:34.032
SYMPATHY IN THIS CASE WHERE HE

30:34.098 --> 30:35.233
WAS SHOT 60 TIMES?

30:35.300 --> 30:36.568
>> AFTER FLE -- AFTER LEADING

30:36.634 --> 30:38.169
THE POLICE ON A HIGH-SPEED CHASE

30:38.236 --> 30:39.837
AND RETURNING FIRE?

30:39.904 --> 30:40.939
>> FIRST OF ALL, LET ME JUST SAY

30:41.005 --> 30:42.240
THIS, THE POLICE, NO, LET'S --

30:42.307 --> 30:44.209
LET'S -- BECAUSE TOO OFTEN MEDIA

30:44.275 --> 30:45.176
REPORTS ON WHAT ARE POLICE

30:45.243 --> 30:46.477
STORIES AS THOUGH IT IS THE

30:46.544 --> 30:48.179
ULTIMATE TRUTH.

30:48.246 --> 30:49.948
WE SEE TOO MANY, TOO MANY

30:50.014 --> 30:50.648
DISCREPANCIES FOR US TO CONS --

30:50.715 --> 30:52.383
CONSISTENTLY LEAN ON WHAT THE

30:52.450 --> 30:53.418
POLICE SAY IS THE TRUTH.

30:53.484 --> 30:54.452
>> ABSOLUTELY, I AGREE.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.386
>> POLICE SAY, WHICH HAS NOT YET

30:55.453 --> 30:56.621
BEEN SUBSTANTIATED OR

30:56.688 --> 30:57.555
CORROBORATED -- THEY SAY THEY

30:57.622 --> 30:59.524
BELIEVE THAT ONE BULLET MIGHT

30:59.591 --> 31:00.358
HAVE COME FROM THE WINDOW.

31:00.425 --> 31:00.959
THEY SAID -- THAT'S WHAT THE

31:01.025 --> 31:01.259
SAY.

31:01.326 --> 31:02.193
THEIR ARGUMENT IS MAYBE --

31:02.260 --> 31:02.827
>> RIGHT, WHO KNOWS IF THAT'S

31:02.894 --> 31:03.127
TRUE?

31:03.194 --> 31:03.895
>> EXACTLY.

31:03.962 --> 31:04.829
BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THEY

31:04.896 --> 31:05.897
SHOT THIS BOY 60 TIMES FOR A

31:05.964 --> 31:06.531
TRAFFIC INFRACTION, I KNOW THAT,

31:06.598 --> 31:09.133
SO.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.335
>> ALL RIGHT, WE'LL HAVE OUR

31:10.401 --> 31:13.004
RISING PANEL JOIN US NEXT.

31:13.071 --> 31:14.939
>> John: THAT IS AMAZING.

31:15.006 --> 31:16.641
IF FOR NOTHING ELSE THAN TO

31:16.708 --> 31:17.976
WATCH BABY RYAN SEACREST TRY TO

31:18.042 --> 31:19.077
WRAP UP THE SEGMENT AFTER

31:19.143 --> 31:20.578
GETTING HIS ASS ABSOLUTELY

31:20.645 --> 31:22.647
HANDED TO HIM.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.715
BUT WHILE IT'S INCREDIBLE TO

31:23.781 --> 31:25.617
WATCH HIM, IN REAL TIME,

31:25.683 --> 31:26.818
BACKTRACK FROM "I DON'T HAVE A

31:26.884 --> 31:28.586
LOT OF SYMPATHY" TO "ABSOLUTELY,

31:28.653 --> 31:29.220
I AGREE, WHO KNOWS WHAT'S

31:29.287 --> 31:31.389
TRUE?," IT SHOULDN'T BE

31:31.456 --> 31:32.757
INCUMBENT ON THAT WOMAN TO WALK

31:32.824 --> 31:33.458
HIM TO THAT POINT.

31:33.524 --> 31:34.125
SHE CAN'T BE ON EVERY LOCAL NEWS

31:34.192 --> 31:39.163
SET.

31:39.230 --> 31:39.764
SHE HAS A LIFE TO LIVE.

31:39.831 --> 31:40.965
AND THERE ARE SMALL CHANGES THAT

31:41.032 --> 31:41.899
MIGHT HELP REORIENT ALL OF OUR

31:41.966 --> 31:42.967
THINKING.

31:43.034 --> 31:49.140
SOME EXPERTS HAVE SUGGESTED

31:49.207 --> 31:49.707
THAT, RATHER THAN GOING WITH

31:49.774 --> 31:50.275
"POLICE SAY," OUTLETS SHOULD

31:50.341 --> 31:50.842
CONSIDER GOING WITH "POLICE

31:50.908 --> 31:51.509
CLAIM," INSTEAD WHICH SEEMS LIKE

31:51.576 --> 31:51.843
A GOOD START.

31:51.909 --> 31:52.944
AND TO BE FAIR, SOME OUTLETS ARE

31:53.011 --> 31:53.711
LOOKING AT OTHER CHANGES.

31:53.778 --> 31:55.647
SOME, LIKE THE "USA TODAY"

31:55.713 --> 31:56.481
NETWORK, HAVE STOPPED PUBLISHING

31:56.547 --> 31:58.516
MUG SHOT GALLERIES, SAYING THEY

31:58.583 --> 32:01.152
FEED INTO NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES

32:01.219 --> 32:02.787
AND ARE OF LIMITED NEWS VALUE.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.922
WHICH THEY ARE.

32:04.989 --> 32:05.523
AND "THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC" HAS

32:05.590 --> 32:06.157
PLEDGED IT WILL FOLLOW ANY CASE

32:06.224 --> 32:08.192
IT COVERS TO ITS CONCLUSION, IN

32:08.259 --> 32:09.327
COURTS OR OTHERWISE.

32:09.394 --> 32:11.062
WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL SAVE PEOPLE

32:11.129 --> 32:13.031
LIKE DARCELL TROTTER FROM HAVING

32:13.097 --> 32:13.631
TO MAKE PHONE CALLS LIKE THE

32:13.698 --> 32:15.733
INCREDIBLY RESTRAINED ONE THAT

32:15.800 --> 32:17.035
YOU SAW HIM MAKE EARLIER.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.836
BUT THE LARGER CULTURAL CHANGE

32:18.903 --> 32:20.238
MIGHT BE FOR OUTLETS TO

32:20.305 --> 32:21.205
FUNDAMENTALLY RECONSIDER WHETHER

32:21.272 --> 32:22.473
THE CRIMES THEY'RE COVERING ARE

32:22.540 --> 32:24.475
ACTUALLY NEWSWORTHY.

32:24.542 --> 32:25.476
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, NOT ALL

32:25.543 --> 32:27.578
CRIMES ARE.

32:27.645 --> 32:29.013
AND CRIME IS ONLY ONE SMALL

32:29.080 --> 32:30.248
SLICE OF THE MUCH BIGGER PICTURE

32:30.315 --> 32:31.683
THEY COULD BE PAINTING OF WHAT'S

32:31.749 --> 32:33.084
HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES.

32:33.151 --> 32:34.686
