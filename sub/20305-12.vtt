NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:05.171 --> 00:07.173
That's two fellow cops dead,

00:07.257 --> 00:09.926
ambushed mercilessly,
apparently at random.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.637
Hi, Marty. Uh, sorry.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.014
I called. You were already gone.

00:14.097 --> 00:14.931
Oh, what's up?

00:15.015 --> 00:17.726
I had an appointment
with my doctor this afternoon.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.562
-Is something wrong?
-Frank, I can't have children.

00:20.645 --> 00:23.940
Every dirty finger points
to the Special Vice Enforcement Unit.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.776
That's Lieutenant Marino,
Sergeant Fox, Sergeant Goldblume.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.070
I'm hearing some very reputable
things about you.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.031
Maybe we can work together
on a regular basis.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.491
Hurry! It's my brother--
he's finna kill him!

00:33.575 --> 00:34.909
JOE: You hit your boy, Mr. Rutledge?

00:34.993 --> 00:37.287
He do something bad, I punish him.
That's a parent's right.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.331
-He has a gun. Get on the floor!
-Please!

00:40.415 --> 00:41.583
Please wait for someone!

00:43.043 --> 00:44.044
Police! Drop it!

00:45.670 --> 00:50.091
(bagpipes playing)

00:50.175 --> 00:52.927
NARRATOR: <i>And now,</i>
<i>tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:53.011 --> 00:54.429
Let's hoof it, rats.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.182
Take a deep breath.
Take a eas-- take it easy.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.018
Don't do it, Bobby. She's dead.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.312
I rendezvous with Marino alone.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.898
-You guys behind me or what?
-Well, sure we are.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.734
You gotta help me, Officer.
They're gonna let him out today.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.069
-Who, your dad?
-Who told you?

01:09.152 --> 01:10.195
Welfare lady.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.280
Is this your pimp mobile?

01:12.363 --> 01:14.491
Hey, you dented my wheels.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.494
Well, that is hardly my fault, shorty.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.379
HENRY: Item eight, the cop killings.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.216
Nothing new to report overnight.

01:31.466 --> 01:35.261
Tag-team patrols continue in each sector
with sector Baker units partnering

01:35.345 --> 01:36.888
with the Van Buren storefront.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.725
For what it's worth,
staff psychologists propose

01:40.809 --> 01:44.938
that the killer is a single individual
suffering from hallucinations

01:45.021 --> 01:48.149
with a persecutory or grandiose content

01:48.233 --> 01:51.111
which could include just about
any guy who talks to himself.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.947
So far we're nowhere on this.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.241
Item nine.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.454
Captain Furillo encountered
an in-progress armed robbery

02:01.538 --> 02:03.623
at a convenience store
on East Corterver last night.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.209
The captain shot
and killed the perpetrators.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.252
(murmuring)

02:07.335 --> 02:09.712
While the captain is finishing
in Internal Affairs this morning,

02:09.796 --> 02:11.923
Lieutenant Calletano
will be in station command.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.469
Item ten. Yes...

02:17.595 --> 02:19.597
our rodent population has returned.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.599
Oh, rats.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.018
(laughter)

02:24.853 --> 02:27.939
Officer Schnitz has informed
our friend from Barber Pest

02:28.231 --> 02:30.608
a retaliatory strike is forthcoming.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.402
Item 11.

02:32.902 --> 02:37.031
Congrats to Bates and Coffey
and the bureaucrats in Washington.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.242
Crime in the vicinity
of our Van Buren storefront

02:39.325 --> 02:40.785
is down 15 percent overnight.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.163
(applause)

02:44.998 --> 02:47.959
Which brings us to item 12.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.254
Stuart Casey's column
in this morning's <i>Trib</i>

02:51.629 --> 02:56.301
and the accompanying photo
featuring two familiar faces.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.387
(applause, cheering)

03:09.063 --> 03:11.274
If you haven't seen it,
Sergeant Esterhaus,

03:11.357 --> 03:14.360
who tells me he's undergoing
a second day of tests at County General,

03:14.986 --> 03:17.280
suggested we pay particular attention

03:17.363 --> 03:20.533
to the following passage
from Casey's article...

03:22.327 --> 03:23.995
"What strikes me most poignantly

03:24.078 --> 03:26.414
is the way our cops
keep doing their jobs--

03:26.497 --> 03:28.124
cop killer or no cop killer.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.794
I spent yesterday on the Hill,
mostly in a Van Buren storefront,

03:31.878 --> 03:33.880
with a couple grunts
named Bates and Coffey,

03:34.380 --> 03:38.134
who handled 20 complaints in three hours,
helped prevent a double suicide,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.803
and never once mentioned
the killer except when I probed.

03:41.554 --> 03:45.516
-Then Coffey, a big, good-looking guy...
-(all exclaiming)

03:45.600 --> 03:49.145
...still with a trace of Little Italy
in his easygoing street charm,

03:49.229 --> 03:52.357
said simply and without bravado,
'Hey, I was in 'Nam.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.818
you learn that every day you put on
a uniform, your life's at risk.'"

03:58.112 --> 03:58.947
Uh...

04:00.990 --> 04:01.824
Item--

04:02.659 --> 04:03.493
Item 13.

04:04.827 --> 04:05.662
Paranoia.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.538
We're all living with it.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.749
To the best of our abilities,

04:10.250 --> 04:12.543
let's not let it ruin
the way we do our jobs.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.338
Okay, let's roll.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.132
And please,
let's be very careful out there.

04:19.592 --> 04:22.345
(indistinct chattering)

04:29.352 --> 04:31.729
LaRue, Washington, what happened
with Orsini last night?

04:31.813 --> 04:33.564
Turned up at the Showroom Lounge
about 2:00.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.567
He gave six grand to Fox and Goldblume.
We got it on tape.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.236
He's supposed to bring
the other six today.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.737
Any chance he'll give that to Marino?

04:39.821 --> 04:43.116
Our only bet will be we turn Orsini,
get him to push it in Marino's direction.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.993
Let's go with that. Let's do it.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.912
-You got Orsini's address?
-Yeah, I think so. Here somewhere.

04:52.792 --> 04:53.668
(screams)

04:54.043 --> 04:54.877
J.D.: Neal!

04:55.461 --> 04:56.337
Neal, you all right?

04:56.421 --> 04:58.089
(gasping)

05:03.177 --> 05:05.388
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:05.805 --> 05:07.473
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:07.557 --> 05:11.352
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:11.436 --> 05:13.062
(sirens wailing)

05:18.526 --> 05:22.447
(theme music playing)

06:24.717 --> 06:26.260
RENKO: Me and Daryl Ann
are gonna catch some flick tonight.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.638
-You and Marty want to join us?
-I don't know, cowboy.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.765
I was supposed to see her last night.

06:30.848 --> 06:31.933
Take another shot, huh?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.560
Yep. I think want to see her
alone, though.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.686
Something's not right.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.647
-What?
-I don't know.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.483
A lot of distance. Always has been.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.944
I want to see if I can push
through it, though.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.779
At least, I feel I gotta try.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.281
Well, you got to do what you got to do.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.409
Excuse me.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.244
Hey, there, Counselor.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.830
What you all got going on up there,
Spanish Inquisition?

06:54.288 --> 06:55.998
-What do you know about it?
-Nothing. Nada.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.960
-Captain.
-Nice going, sir.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.922
-Morning, Captain.
-Morning.

07:03.005 --> 07:03.840
Frank.

07:06.717 --> 07:10.054
Frank, how did it go downtown?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.347
Fine. It went just fine.

07:11.889 --> 07:12.723
And Joyce?

07:13.015 --> 07:15.184
Fine, Ray. Any word on the sniper?

07:15.518 --> 07:16.436
Nothing new.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.646
What about the Showroom Lounge?

07:19.021 --> 07:21.566
LaRue and Washington
are with Orsini in interrogation.

07:21.983 --> 07:22.942
They're waiting for you.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.570
I'll be upstairs with Irwin
if you need me.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.035
I wear my silver bars proudly
this morning, Frank.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.372
It's good to know that management
can still pull the trigger.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.499
Excuse me, Howard.

07:43.463 --> 07:48.342
Marino said not even to talk to him!
So now I'm supposed to hand him six grand!

07:48.426 --> 07:50.261
Is Mr. Orsini aware of his options?

07:50.344 --> 07:54.223
Oh, yeah, Column A,
25 years mandatory, felony trafficking.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.267
Column B, you're partners with us.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.060
End of menu, Sonny.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.813
What's it gonna be?

08:02.523 --> 08:05.985
I mean, it don't make sense, that's all.
I could get killed here.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.528
J.D.: You know, I think he just needs
a couple of minutes

08:07.612 --> 08:09.155
to make up his mind, you know what I mean?

08:09.238 --> 08:11.699
Hey, I tell you what,
Sonny, you got five seconds.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.493
One-1,000, two-1,000...

08:13.576 --> 08:15.328
Hey, just for openers--

08:15.703 --> 08:18.664
I mean, I rendezvous with Marino... alone,

08:19.457 --> 08:20.958
you guys behind me or what?

08:21.042 --> 08:22.210
Well, sure we are.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.254
You're in trouble, all you say is,
"It's hot in here."

08:27.048 --> 08:28.090
"It's hot in here?"

08:28.299 --> 08:29.926
But you put the money on him first, right?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.470
Three-1,000, four-1,000...

08:32.553 --> 08:34.514
It's our six grand this time, Sonny.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.393
I know I'm gonna hate myself for this.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.524
-Attaboy, Sonny.
-(door opens, closes)

08:46.067 --> 08:48.945
Frank, I'm running down a couple
of crackpot snipers from Fish,

08:49.028 --> 08:50.613
then I gotta run over
to county psychiatrics.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.531
On?

08:52.031 --> 08:53.991
The woman on the ledge yesterday,
Mrs. Rutledge.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.328
Are they gonna charge her
with child endangerment?

08:57.578 --> 08:58.412
Pro forma.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.957
I made her a couple
of promises on her boy.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.334
-Joyce is representing.
-She was pretty shaken up.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.711
I never shot anyone, Henry.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.722
I never shot anyone, either.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.267
So maybe I'm not the one to talk to,
but if you wanna--

09:19.350 --> 09:20.184
I'll be all right.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.312
The sooner I get back into things.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.776
Like I said, maybe I'm not
the one to talk to, but...

09:29.777 --> 09:30.611
I appreciate it.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.533
Anyway, everyone thinks you're Wyatt Earp.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.039
This? I got an extra copy for my mom.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.625
You know, I didn't say half
the stuff they wrote in here.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.421
Hey, Spencer, how you doin'?
Something wrong?

09:48.921 --> 09:51.549
You gotta help me, Officer.
They're gonna let him out today.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.217
-Who, your dad?
-Who told you?

09:53.593 --> 09:56.387
Welfare lady.
She said my brother's coming home, too.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.638
And when my dad sees us there--

09:57.722 --> 09:59.765
-Where's your mom?
-At the hospital.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.101
Spencer, I'm gonna see
your mother this morning.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.395
We're not going to let anything bad
happen to your brother.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.606
-Hope not.
-You can count on it.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.777
-Where'd you stay last night?
-Home.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.529
-Alone?
-Yeah.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.865
Let's go get something to eat.
A little breakfast?

10:21.954 --> 10:23.581
JOYCE: As soon as you're released
from the hospital,

10:23.664 --> 10:26.334
you'll automatically be charged
with child endangerment.

10:27.251 --> 10:30.588
That means you endangered Clay's life
when you carried him out on the ledge.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.674
I didn't want to hurt him.
I wanted to save him from his father.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.426
I love my baby.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.053
I understand.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.139
That's why Lieutenant Goldblume wants
to help you, but you've gotta help, too.

10:40.222 --> 10:43.267
Mrs. Rutledge, we can only hold
your husband on a minor charge.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.685
If you sign this additional complaint

10:44.769 --> 10:47.063
saying your husband beat
and abused your child,

10:47.146 --> 10:48.898
we can maybe hold him a little longer.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.024
How much longer?

10:50.107 --> 10:52.360
We don't know. We can't really say.

10:52.443 --> 10:56.280
'Cause if he gets out and he knows
that I signed something against him,

10:57.031 --> 10:58.491
I don't know what he'll do.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.451
There's just no telling.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.996
Mrs. Rutledge, I made you
some promises yesterday

11:04.080 --> 11:05.414
about trying to help Clay.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.709
This is the only chance we have
to keep his father away from him

11:08.793 --> 11:10.378
unless we put him in an institution.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.046
Tell me how...

11:15.132 --> 11:16.425
Tell me how to sign.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.026
Come on, you tell me
you don't think she was cute.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.986
-Joe...
-Keep up the good work.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.281
-She was all right.
-"All right?"

11:40.032 --> 11:42.284
She had a nice personality,
that's what he's saying.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.452
She's cute, but she has
a nice personality.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.995
She had a very pretty face.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.581
Okay, but you think a lot of women
have very pretty faces.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.833
-You know what I'm saying?
-(bang)

11:48.916 --> 11:50.668
What? Here, hold this.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.294
Oh, Lord.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.756
MAN: Hey, José, you little pimp!

11:55.840 --> 11:57.883
Piece of your car fell off
in the street down here!

11:57.967 --> 11:59.677
You better come down here and pick it up!

12:00.886 --> 12:02.388
Hey, José, you little pimp!

12:02.471 --> 12:04.515
All right! What happened?

12:04.932 --> 12:06.809
Hey, I don't know.
I came out to get in my car

12:06.892 --> 12:09.311
and this car had me blocked in again
and then it started smoking.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.479
-Uh-huh. Sure.
-Yeah.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.356
JOSÉ: Man, what is this? What's going--

12:12.440 --> 12:14.692
Hey, man, what'd you let him do
that to my car for, man?

12:14.775 --> 12:17.236
-Don't you know what I paid for it?
-It's your fault, José.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.822
You throw away my ticket yesterday,
now you want police protection.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.532
Hey, why don't you get some
parking lessons, chump?

12:21.615 --> 12:23.951
You gonna give them to me, man?
You gonna give them to me?

12:24.034 --> 12:25.745
-Take it easy!
-Go blow your head off!

12:27.621 --> 12:28.873
(shouting in Spanish)

12:31.876 --> 12:33.669
Been since the sixth grade, Bobby.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.422
-Sixth grade since what?
-Since I got my name in the paper.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.216
I was runner-up
in the American Legion reward.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.846
Spelled my name wrong-- R-E-N-C-K-O.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.014
"Rencko."

12:47.767 --> 12:49.852
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>All units, code 12. Code 12.</i>

12:49.935 --> 12:52.688
<i>Officer down at Murdock and Lincoln</i>
<i>in Jefferson Heights.</i>

12:52.772 --> 12:55.608
<i>Request immediate backup.</i>
<i>Repeat, officer down.</i>

12:55.691 --> 12:58.569
2202 responding
from Dekker and 91st Avenue.

12:58.652 --> 13:03.073
(siren wails)

13:03.157 --> 13:05.743
MAN (on radio): <i>Correction,</i>
<i>there are two officers down.</i>

13:05.826 --> 13:06.702
Marty's working that shift.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.788
There are 80 cops working
Jefferson Heights, Bobby.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.122
Who's the female officer?

13:11.582 --> 13:14.710
What's the unit number?
Give me the unit number!

13:15.586 --> 13:16.545
Come on! Come on!

13:16.629 --> 13:20.007
MAN (on radio): <i>1904 at the scene.</i>
<i>The assaulted unit is 1919.</i>

13:20.090 --> 13:22.301
-Oh, my God.
-Come on! Come on! Come on!

13:41.904 --> 13:44.281
MEDIC: Take a deep breath.
Take it easy, take it easy.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.284
-Hey, relax.
-Hey, how-- how's Marty?

13:47.368 --> 13:49.370
Look, I got a partial on the license.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.412
You want the license?

13:50.746 --> 13:53.791
It was a cream-colored Fairmont.
It was a Fairmont.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.417
MEDIC: Try to keep still.
Try to keep still.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.545
HILL: Let me--
Let me through! Let me through!

13:58.838 --> 14:00.631
Don't do it, Bobby. She's dead.

14:02.716 --> 14:03.551
My God.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.221
I just want to see her.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.224
No. No, you don't.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.284
Description we got from Jaeger
good on the car,

14:28.367 --> 14:29.451
sketchy on the shooter.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.579
Yeah, the Heights is notified.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.415
Marino? Uh, I-I don't know.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.376
Uh, I'm sorry, Chief, but, uh,

14:37.459 --> 14:39.753
all our priority's been on
the sniper right now.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.256
Yeah.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.549
All right.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.052
I heard.

14:48.804 --> 14:52.391
Frank, I know there's
a lot going on, but...

14:54.143 --> 14:55.144
I just...

14:56.520 --> 14:58.647
I-- We've got to talk.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.316
-I know.
-Excuse me, Ms. Davenport.

15:00.399 --> 15:03.527
There's, um, an attorney,
a Ms. Heller wants to see you.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.863
-Who's that?
-On your Rutledge case, I think.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.323
I'll be out, Leo.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.911
Frank, Heights is sending
three extra units.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.080
We'll flood the area around the shooting,
begin door-to-door.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.457
Oh, excuse me.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.084
I'll talk to you later.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.630
(door closes)

15:28.594 --> 15:29.428
Leo.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.847
-Joyce Davenport?
-Ms. Heller?

15:32.556 --> 15:35.434
I'm court-appointed to represent
Mr. Rutledge in this little, uh,

15:35.517 --> 15:36.936
obstructing justice piece of junk.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.564
-Up here on discovery?
-Mm-hmm. Wanna share?

15:40.648 --> 15:43.275
We can get both cases called together.
They're both garbage.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.277
The judge would be delighted
to toss the whole package.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.530
Ms. Heller, did it occur to you that
the interests of your client, the father,

15:48.614 --> 15:50.741
and mine, the mother,
might not be identical?

15:51.158 --> 15:54.453
That the interests of an abused,
deaf child are also at stake here?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.167
Put the men on notifications.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.002
Three units from night shift
to report immediately.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.504
Double time for all
day shifts who want it.

16:03.879 --> 16:07.216
Just got another compulsive confessor.
Claims he did Kennedy, too.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.677
Which one?

16:10.844 --> 16:13.180
Patch all calls through communications
and into line 11.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.230
Bobby, you all right?

16:22.648 --> 16:23.482
I'm ready.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.902
Anything you want, I'm ready.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.947
Anytime you want to go back
on the street, you just do it.

16:39.999 --> 16:40.833
Mick.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.251
Robin, what's the matter?

16:42.584 --> 16:43.585
I was there, Mick.

16:45.295 --> 16:46.213
I saw her.

16:46.588 --> 16:47.423
Marty?

16:48.632 --> 16:50.968
-I saw her, Mick.
-Oh, Robin.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.678
Come here.

16:56.348 --> 17:00.310
Oh, I'm scared. I'm really scared.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.478
You're gonna be all right.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.192
Oh, I can't go back out there, Mick.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.323
Oh, I'm afra--
I'm afraid they're gonna shoot me.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.908
(crying)

17:15.367 --> 17:17.244
Listen to me. Listen to me.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.914
This is the worst place
you could be right now.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.959
Let's go get some fresh air. Come on.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.837
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.178
HENRY: That's all the information
I have right now.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.430
You can call the hospital.
I don't know how much they'll tell you.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.098
You're welcome.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.060
My God, Henry.
I heard they shot two more officers.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.812
One dead, another was wounded.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.981
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to reschedule.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.066
Oh, that's all right.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.818
I've got some work to do up here anyhow
on my mayor's commission report.

17:49.902 --> 17:50.778
Could be a late night, too.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.030
I don't know if we'll
be able to get together.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.157
Henry, you don't have to explain.

17:55.824 --> 17:59.203
Listen, um, no matter what time,
if you want to, call me.

17:59.953 --> 18:00.871
I will.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.626
LEO: One minute, Mr. Thaddeus.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.754
Leo, I need a copy of the 617
on the Rutledge family.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.255
-Coming up.
-Joyce.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.467
-Hello, Fay.
-I heard what happened last night.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.928
Listen, um,

18:16.011 --> 18:18.847
I was supposed to have lunch
with Henry today, but he can't,

18:18.931 --> 18:20.557
and I've got an interview at 3:00.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.060
Would you want to have lunch
with me and talk it through?

18:23.143 --> 18:25.896
Fay, uh, I'm up here on business.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.773
I-I don't have time for lunch.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.441
I don't have time for a hen party.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.236
That's not exactly what I had in mind.

18:34.154 --> 18:34.988
I'm sorry.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.198
Excuse me.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.577
-Ms. Davenport, your 617.
-Thanks, Leo.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.581
Now, Mr. Thaddeus.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.751
Oh, gee, I'm real sorry, Mr. Schnitz.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.130
I don't know what's happened
to Mr. Mar's work recently.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.089
It's okay.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.966
If you just give us back the voucher--

18:54.049 --> 18:56.760
The guy doesn't have his heart
in it or something.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.011
-Who knows?
-Yeah.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.348
I'll tell you, Mar works from
a kind of a native genius,

19:01.431 --> 19:03.934
but he's a-a little unstable.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.311
But, hey, comes with the territory,
know what I mean?

19:06.395 --> 19:08.772
Not all of us can do this kind of work.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.650
Anyway, if you'll just
give us back the voucher--

19:11.733 --> 19:13.819
Don't worry. I'm his supervisor.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.989
I'm taking them an extra six blocks,
a full half mile--

19:17.072 --> 19:18.657
no additional charge.

19:18.740 --> 19:22.202
You can take them
to the 116th Street fire station

19:22.286 --> 19:25.247
for all I care,
just take them out of here.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.373
You got it.

19:33.714 --> 19:39.720
(bagpipes playing)

19:41.096 --> 19:42.556
Let's hoof it, rats.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.227
("Camptown Races" plays on bagpipes)

20:00.115 --> 20:03.744
BAILIFF: Docket number N639472,
Wilma Rutledge.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.204
One count child endangerment.

20:05.787 --> 20:09.458
And docket number N639488,
Harold Rutledge.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.335
Obstructing justice, resisting arrest,

20:11.418 --> 20:14.421
and also child endangerment,
on for bail setting.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.506
Family situation.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.302
Counsel, approach. Officers as well.

20:27.017 --> 20:30.229
Would, uh, this be a matter better handled
by family court, Mr. DA?

20:30.312 --> 20:33.523
Uh, they won't take it, Judge.
Not with the obstruction and resisting.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.693
Your Honor, my client
has a four-and-a-half-year-old boy

20:36.777 --> 20:38.904
who is deaf
and doesn't know sign language,

20:38.987 --> 20:40.489
currently in protective custody.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.950
His mother is the only one
that can communicate with him

20:43.033 --> 20:44.952
and she desperately wants
to take care of him.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.453
Strange way of showing it.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.122
Her suicide attempt was a reflection

20:49.206 --> 20:51.708
of her helplessness
in trying to protect the child

20:51.792 --> 20:53.252
from further abuse by the father.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.420
Since when does your practice
include psychiatry?

20:55.504 --> 20:56.964
You don't have to be a psychiatrist

20:57.047 --> 20:59.216
to recognize a family
that's being terrorized.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.176
That'll do. Officers?

21:01.635 --> 21:04.680
I was at a prior domestic at the Rutledge
home yesterday, Your Honor.

21:05.138 --> 21:07.057
I can't prove that the child was abused,

21:07.140 --> 21:09.768
but I think that definitely the father
should be kept away from these children.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.478
JOYCE: Which is what Mrs. Rutledge wants.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.772
So we jail him on some
half-baked resisting charge?

21:13.855 --> 21:15.899
There's also an endangerment.

21:16.191 --> 21:18.360
My client is employed.
He has a clean record.

21:18.902 --> 21:22.072
Mr. DA, do you have
any reason to believe that, uh,

21:22.155 --> 21:24.116
Mr. Rutledge would not
show up for a hearing?

21:24.324 --> 21:25.158
No.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.120
Judge, please... keep the father inside.

21:28.203 --> 21:31.123
Is it your opinion, Lieutenant,
that the mother, if left alone,

21:31.206 --> 21:32.958
would be a competent parent?

21:33.041 --> 21:36.169
It's a difficult situation,
but if I had to guess, I'd say "yes."

21:37.587 --> 21:39.756
All right, people, step back, please.

21:43.176 --> 21:46.513
Both defendants released on recognizance
pending preliminary hearings.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.390
Set a law and date, Bailiff.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.060
-You, Mr. Rutledge.
-Yes, sir, Your Honor.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.146
I'm notifying Welfare to return the boy.

21:54.938 --> 21:58.150
You have one hour to pick up your clothes
and vacate the family residence.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.902
Officers Bates and Coffey
will accompany you

22:00.986 --> 22:02.195
to see that you comply.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.364
Your Honor, but where
am I supposed to sleep?

22:04.781 --> 22:07.326
Providing accommodations
is not my responsibility...

22:07.409 --> 22:09.411
-What's going on?
-JUDGE: However, if I hear that you...

22:09.494 --> 22:11.121
Your father's gonna have to move out.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.748
Then Welfare's gonna bring
your brother back.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.292
...provide you a bunk
at the Michigan Avenue complex.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.044
-(gavel bangs)
-Next case.

22:18.003 --> 22:21.757
BAILIFF: Docket number V24476171...

22:33.560 --> 22:35.604
I gotta talk to you personal, Marino.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.192
No, you don't.

22:41.735 --> 22:42.652
Get lost.

22:42.736 --> 22:43.570
No.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.531
I ain't gonna be dealing
with no middleman.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.242
You're the boss. I'm making big payments.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.661
Gotta be to the boss direct.

22:58.668 --> 22:59.628
Wrong number, Jack.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.505
Not even close.

23:04.925 --> 23:05.759
JACK: Oh, man.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.471
Pretty hot in here, isn't it, guys?

23:09.846 --> 23:11.306
He said it's hot in there, babe.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.393
Hmm? I can believe it. Hot in here, too.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.741
Come on, take it easy.

23:30.951 --> 23:31.993
It's roasting in here.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.871
It is? Then you'd be happy
to take your coat off.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.331
Tony, no problem with that.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.833
Take it off. Take it off!

23:37.916 --> 23:40.377
-Relax!
-Where is it, huh?

23:40.460 --> 23:42.587
Hey, you guys are the cops.
What, I'm gonna wear a wire?

23:42.671 --> 23:44.297
What do you think I am, crazy?

23:45.841 --> 23:46.883
Take it easy!

23:47.092 --> 23:48.760
Look. Look at this.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.138
I'm sweating like a pork,
it's so hot in here.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.015
(both panting)

23:59.187 --> 24:01.606
-So you're not wired.
-Of course not.

24:02.858 --> 24:03.900
(groaning)

24:25.005 --> 24:26.798
Just think if you were wired.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.344
Stay away from me.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.579
(whistles)

24:57.662 --> 24:59.372
I told you it was hot in there!

24:59.456 --> 25:00.874
-Where were you?
-Hey, look, look.

25:00.957 --> 25:03.251
There was a buzz in the wire.
We could hardly hear, Sonny.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.504
-Did you get what you needed at least?
-We'll get it next time.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.796
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.173
Hey, look, we'll talk about it later.

25:08.256 --> 25:09.508
Hey, take him to county emergency, okay?

25:09.591 --> 25:11.635
We don't want this getting
around to anyone, you understand?

25:11.718 --> 25:13.887
How am I gonna talk?!
They're gonna wire my jaw!

25:13.970 --> 25:16.097
That's good. That's great.
You have them wire it shut!

25:16.181 --> 25:17.307
Yo, here, take this.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.439
I don't know what it is.

25:27.317 --> 25:31.071
I was there when Pete Dorsey got killed.
I handled it, right? I stayed on duty.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.072
I remember.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.534
So what happened?

25:37.244 --> 25:40.580
I mean, all of a sudden, I--
I just got this feeling like I'm--

25:41.289 --> 25:42.457
like I'm numb inside.

25:43.833 --> 25:44.918
You still feel that way?

25:46.711 --> 25:49.339
It's all right to feel that way.
It happens sometimes.

25:54.052 --> 25:54.886
I knew Marty.

25:56.805 --> 25:57.764
She was great.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.850
Robin, do you want me to take you home?

26:03.186 --> 26:04.187
I don't know.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.148
(sighs)

26:07.232 --> 26:08.525
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>All units in the vicinity,</i>

26:08.608 --> 26:12.737
<i>possible sniper suspect</i>
<i>reported entering 9901 Jefferson.</i>

26:12.988 --> 26:15.991
<i>Suspect description, white male, 5'10"...</i>

26:16.533 --> 26:18.243
-I'll come back for you.
-No.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.246
Robin.

26:21.329 --> 26:23.164
If I don't do it now, I'll never do it!

26:23.915 --> 26:24.749
Just go.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.210
Just go!

26:27.961 --> 26:30.463
(siren wails)

26:44.477 --> 26:45.729
-MICK: Which way?
-He's inside.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.106
-We sure this is the guy?
-Yeah, an off-duty detective spotted him

26:48.189 --> 26:50.150
walking away from
a cream-colored Fairmont on Dekker

26:50.233 --> 26:51.735
and we got a match on the partial.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.900
Go ahead! Give me a reason!

27:31.983 --> 27:33.860
Don't kill me! Don't-- don't kill me!

27:37.155 --> 27:38.073
MICK: Come on. Move.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.408
Come on. Move.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.288
Move!

27:47.040 --> 27:49.042
LaRue and Washington
had problems with Orsini.

27:49.125 --> 27:49.959
It's okay.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.628
Call them off and get them
on the search warrant.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.255
MICK: Name. Name, hair bag!

27:54.339 --> 27:56.883
-He still won't give us his name.
-We don't need it. Book him "John Doe."

27:56.966 --> 27:58.760
Go for the warrant
on the uniforms testimony

27:58.843 --> 28:00.387
and testimony from the super.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.305
-What about the press?
-Not until it's cleared with Division.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.057
Make sure the men understand that.
How's Jaeger?

28:04.140 --> 28:05.600
Get him up here. I want an ID.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.851
I already put the call in.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.187
LEO: One butane lighter,
one brass money clip,

28:09.270 --> 28:13.191
one plastic comb,
cash in the amount of $119.40.

28:13.274 --> 28:14.192
Do you want to sign this?

28:15.944 --> 28:17.404
Put your hands up on the counter.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.280
Get those hands up.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.202
Relax your finger.

28:24.828 --> 28:29.457
Did you hear the officer?
He said relax it.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.336
MAN: Sir, could you get out--

28:43.430 --> 28:45.807
Frank, hang on. We have recovered a rifle.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.852
Maxwell and Beam found it in a Dumpster
two blocks from the Fairmont.

28:48.935 --> 28:50.645
-They're on their way to SIV.
-Thanks, Howard.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.730
-Yeah.
-Ray.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.108
Double the guard on the suspect.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.818
Rush him through booking
and get him into a room.

28:56.901 --> 28:57.986
Jaeger won't be here for half an hour.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.280
Neither will his lawyer.
Let's not waste any time.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.910
We have the car you rented,
the rifle you threw into the alley,

29:05.994 --> 29:08.663
and a positive ID
from one of the cops you shot.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.374
You finally missed one, hair bag,
but he ain't gonna miss you.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.086
Hey, pally, where's my attorney?

29:15.170 --> 29:18.298
Now, look, you're a sick guy.
You killed some cops, okay?

29:19.841 --> 29:22.594
You want us to help you,
you gotta talk to us now.

29:25.930 --> 29:26.890
Shove it!

29:27.932 --> 29:29.350
Hey, easy.

29:30.685 --> 29:32.061
LAWYER: Having a nice conversation?

29:34.105 --> 29:35.523
I'll talk to my client now.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.661
Hey, Mick! Mick, Mick, listen.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.580
When you get a minute,
I'd like to ask you about the arrest.

29:50.663 --> 29:51.998
-What arrest?
-Oh, come on.

29:52.081 --> 29:54.167
-Not now, Stu. Not now!
-Yeah, but what about--

29:59.172 --> 30:01.883
-Did you get anything new?
-No, his attorney showed.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.719
How soon do they think
before the ballistics?

30:05.220 --> 30:06.513
Hour, hour and a half.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.682
MAN: Officer Jaeger, could we
have a few words, please?

30:09.766 --> 30:10.600
Just comment, all right?

30:10.683 --> 30:13.019
What do you say? Give us a clue, huh?

30:19.150 --> 30:20.443
You were okay out there.

30:21.736 --> 30:22.612
Yeah, I guess.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.909
Well, I guess I'll go finish my shift.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.745
I think that's probably the best idea.

30:31.412 --> 30:32.372
Thanks, Mick.

30:33.081 --> 30:33.915
Hey...

30:36.209 --> 30:37.043
I love you.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.921
I was scared for you out there.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.302
RAY: Face front.

30:50.473 --> 30:51.724
Ask number three to look up.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.018
Raise your chin, number three.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.441
-I don't see him.
-FRANK: Next group.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.402
Okay, second group.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.879
That's him. Number f-five. You got him.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.214
-FRANK: You sure?
-JAEGER: Yeah, I'm positive.

31:25.508 --> 31:26.342
Okay.

31:26.926 --> 31:28.636
Hold him downstairs,
let me know as soon as you hear

31:28.720 --> 31:30.013
from Ballistics and call Division.

31:30.096 --> 31:30.972
Thanks, Mike.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.184
I want to kill the man, Captain.

31:39.522 --> 31:40.899
Just got prelim ballistics.

31:42.442 --> 31:43.985
It's a match with the bullet
that killed Nichols,

31:44.068 --> 31:45.737
but different from the ones
that killed the others.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.489
Same caliber, same kind of rifle,
different ballistics.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.074
-Copycat.
-Damn!

31:51.492 --> 31:53.161
-FAY: Whose car is this?!
-(car horn honks)

31:53.244 --> 31:54.913
Do you know whose car this is?

31:54.996 --> 31:57.957
Could somebody please find
the person who owns this car?

31:58.041 --> 31:59.083
-Mrs. Furillo.
-What?

31:59.167 --> 32:00.293
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, hi.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.462
I was-- I was down here
to see an unwed mother,

32:02.545 --> 32:05.173
but I didn't think I was gonna
take up permanent residence.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.550
<i>Pero, mami,</i> what's your problem?

32:07.884 --> 32:11.804
Is this your vehicle?
Is this your pimp mobile?

32:11.888 --> 32:13.973
Hey, you dented my wheels.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.018
Well, that is hardly my fault, shorty.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.853
-Mrs.--
-Let me tell you something.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.982
I have been sitting in this car for over
ten minutes in a legal parking space

32:23.066 --> 32:26.527
being blocked by
your inconsiderate behavior!

32:26.903 --> 32:28.738
I've got a hot flash for you, mister,

32:28.821 --> 32:30.949
you are not the only person
in the universe!

32:31.032 --> 32:32.992
There are other people who have lives.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.286
I have a little boy who's due home
from school any minute,

32:35.370 --> 32:37.580
and I haven't even picked my baby
up from the sitter!

32:37.956 --> 32:39.374
Now, where were you raised, in a kennel?

32:39.457 --> 32:43.127
-Hey, give me--
-Don't you "hey" me! I'm talking to you!

32:43.211 --> 32:46.506
Hey, what's the matter with you, lady?
I'm trying to conduct some business here.

32:46.589 --> 32:49.926
You aren't even fit
for decent people to talk to.

32:50.009 --> 32:51.719
Hey, this woman's abusing my rights!

32:51.803 --> 32:54.889
Officer? Officer?
I think someone has been shot!

32:54.973 --> 32:56.683
-What?
-Someone has been shot!

32:56.766 --> 32:58.393
-Okay. Where? Where? Where?
-Come this way.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.727
You're on your own, José.

33:00.353 --> 33:02.021
José. Is that your name?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.398
-Yes. José.
-José?

33:03.481 --> 33:06.776
-José.
-Well, let me tell you something, José...

33:06.859 --> 33:07.735
WOMAN: I've seen him before.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.196
He's always angry,
but maybe today he was drunk.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.157
I heard him yell real loud
and then I heard a gun go off.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.075
All right.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.536
-In there.
-All right. Stay there.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.787
Stay back, please.

33:18.746 --> 33:19.580
Ready?

33:20.331 --> 33:22.375
(woman crying)

33:53.239 --> 33:55.074
He came back after you left.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.369
He was gonna shoot her.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.665
I just tried to stop him.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.377
I didn't want to shoot him.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.379
Hey, it's all right.

34:10.131 --> 34:13.676
I didn't want to shoot him.
It just went off.

34:14.385 --> 34:15.970
JOE: It's okay, Spencer. It's okay.

34:18.723 --> 34:19.724
I'll call it in.

34:20.349 --> 34:22.935
Let's get everybody out of here, please.
Who are you?

34:24.312 --> 34:25.271
County Welfare.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.399
Okay.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.651
Mrs. Rutledge, let's go.

34:32.945 --> 34:33.780
Come on.

34:36.657 --> 34:37.492
Good.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.544
-Excuse me. Do you work here?
-MICK: Yes, I do.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.130
Are you familiar with an individual
named James Thaddeus?

34:52.673 --> 34:54.884
James Thaddeus. No.

34:54.967 --> 34:57.428
The exterminator that plays the bagpipes.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.806
Here's his card. He said you sent him.

35:02.016 --> 35:03.768
I didn't send anybody anyplace.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.563
Well, we got rats now. We want them out.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.816
Well, if you got rats,
get an exterminator.

35:09.899 --> 35:13.694
The exterminator brought the rats!
116th Street fire station.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.405
You got infestation,
you ought to get rid of them.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.324
-Look, you guys had the rats.
-I gotta go.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.910
I tell you what,
if you find our khaki officer,

35:20.993 --> 35:22.829
he'll be able to tell you who we use.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.168
-Hey, anything new?
-No, nothing.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.795
-What about the lineup?
-Who are you?

35:30.878 --> 35:32.088
Stu Casey, <i>Times Tribune.</i>

35:32.171 --> 35:34.090
If there's a release,
you'll get it with the rest of the press.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.675
-Frank.
-This isn't the six o'clock news, Henry.

35:35.758 --> 35:38.177
He's all right, Frank.
He did a piece in this morning's paper.

35:38.261 --> 35:40.221
I don't care. He doesn't have a pass.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.683
-Hey, Casey. Casey, for you.
-Oh.

35:43.766 --> 35:46.644
Forwarded from your office.
Don't tie up the phone, huh?

35:46.727 --> 35:48.062
Yeah, thanks. Casey.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.904
Uh, well-well, listen,
it's very noisy here.

35:56.988 --> 35:57.989
Can you wait a second?

35:59.073 --> 36:01.909
Yeah, well, listen, it's still very noisy.
Why don't you give me your number?

36:02.326 --> 36:03.452
No, no, wait! Let's talk!

36:05.163 --> 36:05.997
Hello?

36:07.290 --> 36:08.124
Hello?

36:10.710 --> 36:11.544
Who was it?

36:12.378 --> 36:13.212
I don't know.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.673
He said whoever shot those two cops today

36:15.756 --> 36:17.884
didn't shoot the first four,
but he knows who did, and...

36:18.885 --> 36:20.678
he knows who's gonna
shoot the next four.

36:24.765 --> 36:26.851
WOMAN: I was returning Clay to his mother.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.314
Mr. Rutledge, he had the weapon
when he answered the door.

36:32.857 --> 36:33.733
He was drunk.

36:35.651 --> 36:36.694
And he threatened the family?

36:37.111 --> 36:40.072
Mrs. Rutledge and Spencer
had been struck by him.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.699
He was pointing the gun at them.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.035
Then...

36:45.578 --> 36:48.289
Mr. Rutledge and Spencer started fighting.

36:49.957 --> 36:51.959
Mr. Rutledge dropped the weapon and...

36:52.877 --> 36:54.670
Spencer was the first to get to it.

36:57.089 --> 37:02.720
Then Mr. Rutledge picked up a knife
and he started advancing on Mrs. Rutledge.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.556
When Spencer fired the--

37:05.640 --> 37:07.266
(moans)

37:07.350 --> 37:08.184
I'm sorry.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.270
It's all right, Mama. It's all right.

37:11.604 --> 37:12.772
Will the boy be charged?

37:13.397 --> 37:15.358
I don't think so. Looks like self-defense.

37:15.441 --> 37:17.193
SPENCER: It's all right, Mama.
It's all right.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.987
You know, it sounds strange, but I think
they're lucky the gun went off.

37:20.821 --> 37:24.242
On the contrary, what is strange is
the random discharge of a handgun

37:24.325 --> 37:27.912
can effect more justice
than a 200-year-old legal system.

37:45.137 --> 37:45.972
Captain.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.558
-Search of Nolan's apartment.
-Eight grand in cash.

37:49.642 --> 37:50.810
-In the icebox.
-Anything else?

37:50.893 --> 37:53.688
Yeah, the guy's rap sheets.
Got AKAs up the yin yang.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.190
Denny Nolan, Danny Nolan, Michael Sprague,

37:56.274 --> 37:57.817
Michael Springer--
I can't even remember them all.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.152
Frank, there's something in the war room
you and Irwin have to see.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.862
-It's urgent.
-Thanks, guys.

38:12.248 --> 38:15.001
RAY: Here. This is the one. Nolan.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.836
-And Marino.
-Yes.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.717
FRANK: We have you on film with Marino.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.468
We recovered 8,000 in cash
from your apartment.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.512
I want to know what the hell's going on,
and save the legalese.

38:26.595 --> 38:28.806
Captain, I'm only concerned
with my client's best interest.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.224
FRANK: You want a line on that?

38:30.308 --> 38:32.893
You have one option, and if you want it,
you better take it fast

38:32.977 --> 38:34.854
because it's not one
anybody's anxious to give.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.480
We're prepared to waive the death penalty.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.691
Twenty-five to life, no bargaining down.
That's it.

38:38.774 --> 38:41.152
Eligible for parole
after 16 and two-thirds.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.783
-Protection?
-He gives us everything,

38:47.867 --> 38:49.243
I promise no one goes near him.

38:53.622 --> 38:58.627
Marino busted me a couple of years ago.
We done a few things since.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.176
He wanted some work done
for the eight grand.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.093
Why?

39:07.595 --> 39:09.597
-I don't know.
-What exactly did he tell you?

39:10.890 --> 39:14.852
He, uh, told me to do a copycat,

39:15.895 --> 39:16.812
take down the cop.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.356
Which cop?

39:18.898 --> 39:20.024
-I don't know.
-Which cop?

39:21.609 --> 39:22.610
Her.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.030
Just her.

39:27.490 --> 39:30.159
I hit him to make it look like the sniper.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.334
One more condition until we get Marino.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.461
We put your client in deepfreeze.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.880
Nothing goes out of this room.
Is that understood, Mr. Lupowitz?

39:45.299 --> 39:46.300
Yeah.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.560
We ring the wrong bell tonight,
Marino's gone.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.563
Goldblume's gone, Fox is gone.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.400
Oh, we're keeping Lucy
surveilled the next 12 hours,

40:02.483 --> 40:03.776
come morning, we'll have warrants.

40:03.859 --> 40:05.528
We'll know right where to nail all three.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.613
And if there's a leak to the press
that we have Nolan?

40:08.614 --> 40:11.200
Our public statement is
we've arrested a John Doe.

40:11.617 --> 40:14.078
We've got a gag on Casey
in exchange for an exclusive.

40:14.453 --> 40:16.872
Lupowitz would have to be a fool
to release Nolan's name.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.749
I want to know why he had her killed.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.085
(sighs)

40:21.168 --> 40:22.920
She could have had something on him.

40:23.003 --> 40:24.547
You know, she could have been
investigating him.

40:25.172 --> 40:26.715
Or she could have been
in business with him.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.053
All we know is, she didn't come to us.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.056
We'll find out, Frank.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.393
We're done.

40:37.852 --> 40:38.894
Tomorrow.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.147
Then maybe I'll meet my wife again.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.525
Bobby.

40:48.195 --> 40:51.365
J.D. said Marty wasn't killed
by the sniper.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.118
It was some kind of hit.
Something with Marino.

40:54.201 --> 40:56.036
Bobby, I'm sorry about Marty,

40:56.495 --> 40:59.039
but as for the other,
I can't say just now.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.958
They were both in Midtown.
She worked vice for a while.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.751
-Maybe she was investigating him.
-We don't know.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.420
-We just don't know.
-Then let me find out.

41:04.503 --> 41:05.463
You listen to me.

41:07.339 --> 41:08.966
All those days and nights
up in that cubicle--

41:09.049 --> 41:10.176
this is what all that was about.

41:10.259 --> 41:13.053
We're gonna move on those people tomorrow.
We can't lose that. Do you understand?

41:13.137 --> 41:14.430
Captain, I have to do something.

41:14.513 --> 41:16.891
Well, for your sake and for her's,
you stay out of it for now.

41:16.974 --> 41:20.102
This is not the time.
Go home, stay with somebody.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.479
You keep complete secrecy on this

41:21.562 --> 41:23.439
and I'll tell you
about all of it tomorrow.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.113
Neal, J.D.

41:36.952 --> 41:39.371
-Who else did you tell?
-He was in love with her, Captain.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.956
-Not another word.
-Sorry.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.875
Don't be sorry, just don't be a fool.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.093
-(door opens)
-HENRY: Frank?

41:59.308 --> 42:01.227
-I feel as if I'm gonna explode.
-Easy.

42:01.560 --> 42:02.394
Breathe easy.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.604
Yeah.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.023
-I couldn't catch my breath.
-You're entitled.

42:08.901 --> 42:11.362
Boy, if there's been a worse
24-hour period around here,

42:11.445 --> 42:12.655
I'd like to know when.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.783
Well, can I get back to you on that?

42:22.081 --> 42:25.292
I haven't been a very good
friend to you lately, Henry.

42:26.001 --> 42:28.045
-I intend to do better.
-I know that, Frank.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.673
-I'm just trying to help.
-You did.

42:33.008 --> 42:33.842
You do.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.845
Can I give you some advice?

42:40.933 --> 42:42.601
Let's get the hell out of here.

42:57.157 --> 42:58.158
Mrs. Rutledge?

42:58.951 --> 42:59.868
Yes.

43:00.411 --> 43:01.579
How are you?

43:03.289 --> 43:04.164
I don't know.

43:07.251 --> 43:10.421
If you can, take it one day at a time.

43:11.338 --> 43:12.590
One hour at a time.

43:19.471 --> 43:20.389
It gets better.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.148
Spencer's not going to be charged.

43:29.523 --> 43:31.317
Oh, Lord, thank you.

43:32.234 --> 43:33.444
Thank you, thank you.

43:33.527 --> 43:36.822
I told Ms. Davenport that Clay
could benefit from private tutoring,

43:36.905 --> 43:39.074
and more intensive than
the county could afford to pay.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.076
Who's gonna pay it, then?

43:41.994 --> 43:44.121
JOYCE: If you'd allow me, I'd like to.

43:45.873 --> 43:48.125
Ms. Davenport, you've helped us so much.

43:49.376 --> 43:50.628
It would make me feel good.

43:51.503 --> 43:52.421
It would help me.

43:53.547 --> 43:54.715
I don't know what to say.

43:58.844 --> 43:59.678
Bless you.

44:00.679 --> 44:01.805
God bless you.

44:16.445 --> 44:17.446
Bye, Spencer.

44:24.119 --> 44:25.663
(crying)

44:35.255 --> 44:37.466
(slow blues music plays)

44:37.549 --> 44:39.468
(people chattering)

44:45.057 --> 44:46.850
You won't tell me what the captain said?

44:49.186 --> 44:50.020
No.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.482
Wanna sit here till you close
this establishment down?

44:54.233 --> 44:55.067
Yes, I do.

44:56.485 --> 44:57.319
Well, then.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.238
I'm here to do it with you, son.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.200
Two more overproofs, Jason.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.246
She was so beautiful, Renko.

45:09.331 --> 45:10.541
I wish I understood her.

45:13.252 --> 45:15.129
I just wish she was still alive.

45:39.445 --> 45:40.612
Maybe I need glasses.

45:41.029 --> 45:42.573
Here, try these.

45:46.869 --> 45:48.954
Huh. You're blind.

45:50.456 --> 45:53.834
Not so blind I can't see
how much pain we've both been in.

45:56.628 --> 45:58.714
In the last 24 hours, we lost a house,

45:58.797 --> 46:01.383
you found out you couldn't have babies,
I killed a man,

46:01.842 --> 46:04.678
Marty Nichols was murdered,
a 14-year-old boy killed his father,

46:04.762 --> 46:06.764
and we still have
a cop killer on the loose.

46:06.847 --> 46:08.182
What would you like to talk about first?

46:11.518 --> 46:15.731
You know the Matthew Arnold poem
about a darkling plain?

46:17.399 --> 46:18.233
That's how I feel.

46:19.902 --> 46:25.365
Like we've been living on a darkling plain
"Where ignorant armies clash by night."

46:28.202 --> 46:29.036
Frank...

46:32.206 --> 46:34.208
I was never scared
of being married to a cop.

46:37.711 --> 46:39.838
Now I'm afraid I'll never
not be scared again.

46:40.589 --> 46:41.423
Me, too.

46:42.090 --> 46:43.509
When you ran out of that car...

46:44.802 --> 46:46.845
God help me,
I thought I'd never see you alive again,

46:46.929 --> 46:49.515
and I was furious
that you'd risk your life so easily.

46:50.349 --> 46:51.183
Easily?

46:52.559 --> 46:53.727
I was terrified.

46:55.437 --> 46:56.563
Maybe I'm crazy...

46:58.232 --> 47:01.443
but I saw you at that moment
less afraid of some punk with a gun

47:01.527 --> 47:03.278
than you were of dealing with me.

47:05.155 --> 47:06.490
Maybe you're not so crazy.

47:09.409 --> 47:11.161
Frank, I don't have a secret life.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.041
I tell you everything
that goes on with me.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.713
It's just that in this particular case,

47:21.797 --> 47:24.299
I was hoping there
wouldn't be anything to tell.

47:26.176 --> 47:28.470
When we got married,
there was no asterisk on the vow

47:28.554 --> 47:31.974
that said I'd cherish and keep you
only if you made babies.

47:40.566 --> 47:41.984
Maybe I can't have babies,

47:44.069 --> 47:45.737
but I think we can have it all.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.448
A home, a family.

47:51.577 --> 47:54.580
I've got a lot
of mothering instincts in me. (chuckles)

47:57.165 --> 47:58.333
You got a little for me?

47:59.251 --> 48:01.670
After the last couple of days,
I could use some mothering.

48:04.214 --> 48:05.132
Come here, baby.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.734
(closing theme playing)
