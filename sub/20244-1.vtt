00:46.958 --> 00:47.750
Good evening.

00:47.792 --> 00:50.250
Hello everyone who is in front of the TV.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.542
Glad to see you again.

00:52.458 --> 00:55.375
Today, "Chef please" will be introducing you

00:55.417 --> 00:56.833
the gourmet at Spring Avenue.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.667
As the most famous gourmet street in the country,

01:00.917 --> 01:02.833
Spring Avenue already has 30 years of history.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.375
There are many outstanding restaurants

01:05.750 --> 01:06.833
and great chefs,

01:07.333 --> 01:09.250
that make veteran gourmand must pay a visit.

01:10.208 --> 01:12.417
And today, we bring you visiting

01:12.625 --> 01:15.292
the restaurant that has the longest history here,

01:15.500 --> 01:16.500
the Seven.

01:18.708 --> 01:19.667
I am going to introduce you

01:19.708 --> 01:22.458
the person in charge of Seven, Miss Uni.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.500
Welcome.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.958
Uni not only in charge of Seven.

01:27.083 --> 01:28.583
She is also my old classmate.

01:28.833 --> 01:31.042
But she is not the protagonist of today.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.000
Is the soul person of this restaurant ready?

01:34.458 --> 01:35.250
- Ready.
- Yes.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.333
Uni, could you please briefly explain

01:41.417 --> 01:42.958
what kind of dish that is being made?

01:43.542 --> 01:45.250
This dish is called
"3-cup chicken stewed rice noodles"

01:45.750 --> 01:47.250
3-cup actually means

01:47.292 --> 01:49.583
one cup each of soy sauce,
sesame oil and rice wine.

01:50.125 --> 01:51.833
Soy sauce for soaking in flavor
and sesame oil for enhancing aroma.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.750
Stir fry the chicken,
green onion, ginger and garlic.

01:54.917 --> 01:55.958
Put in casserole

01:56.083 --> 01:57.583
and then add the rice noodles and basil.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.167
Here the basil.

02:00.292 --> 02:01.292
- These are...
- Corning.

02:01.333 --> 02:02.792
- Good.
- This is basil?

02:03.875 --> 02:04.875
How about the cup of rice wine?

02:05.417 --> 02:06.875
That is the most important step.

02:07.167 --> 02:07.958
Look,

02:08.000 --> 02:08.875
Circle this cup of rice wine

02:08.917 --> 02:10.792
to the edge of the casserole,

02:11.167 --> 02:12.250
let the wine penetrating into the casserole.

02:12.583 --> 02:13.917
And use the towel to seal the edge,

02:14.292 --> 02:15.292
so the steam will not leak out.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.042
When rice wine meets the heat, it evaporates.

02:17.375 --> 02:18.708
The flavors of the wine, chicken, rice noodles

02:18.750 --> 02:20.542
and basil merged.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.167
The taste is awesome.

02:23.292 --> 02:25.083
How long has he been practicing this pose?

02:25.500 --> 02:26.500
3 days.

02:27.417 --> 02:28.458
Does it smell good?

02:28.500 --> 02:29.500
It does smell great.

02:32.833 --> 02:33.833
- Taste it.
- Okay.

02:35.333 --> 02:36.333
Hey!

02:36.833 --> 02:38.167
Just for your shooting.

02:38.208 --> 02:39.792
You need to line up if you want to eat.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.250
- Thank you, bye-bye.
- Next.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.958
How long have been waited? It's almost an hour.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.458
- What are you doing? Don't push!
- Cut in the line?!

02:51.208 --> 02:52.792
- Waiter, menu.
- Are you cutting in line?

02:52.833 --> 02:54.042
Why is that hot here?

02:54.083 --> 02:56.083
Didn't they pay the air-conditioning fee?

02:56.250 --> 02:58.792
- Turn on the air-conditioner.
- Here, the menu.

03:02.375 --> 03:03.375
Order.

03:04.958 --> 03:05.917
What do you want to eat? Say it.

03:05.958 --> 03:07.125
I don't want those dishes on that table,

03:07.375 --> 03:08.667
make me something that eatable.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.208
Remember, less oil, less salt.

03:10.542 --> 03:11.958
I recently care about my health.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.458
Hurry UP-

03:15.458 --> 03:17.792
<i>"Queuing."</i>

03:17.958 --> 03:18.958
What does it mean?

03:19.125 --> 03:20.708
Why don't you get in the queue
when everyone is queuing up?

03:22.792 --> 03:24.208
Only ants queue.

03:25.708 --> 03:26.792
Do you know who my boss is?

03:27.542 --> 03:29.458
The eight hundred acres back there are ours.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.417
That tall building is ours too.

03:31.458 --> 03:32.708
I don't give a damn who your boss is,

03:33.250 --> 03:34.458
and I don't care how rich you are.

03:34.917 --> 03:36.125
There is only one way

03:36.542 --> 03:37.542
to eat at Seven,

03:38.167 --> 03:39.167
which is same as the others,

03:39.500 --> 03:40.500
to queue.

03:41.833 --> 03:44.042
What a lame restaurant,

03:44.333 --> 03:45.667
My boss already hired

03:45.708 --> 03:47.333
a world-class chef to open a restaurant

03:47.458 --> 03:48.458
right opposite to yours.

03:48.750 --> 03:49.750
How dare you asking me to queue?

03:51.583 --> 03:56.208
Just queue...

03:56.250 --> 03:57.292
The end of the queue is at the village entrance,

03:57.333 --> 03:58.458
take a bus to get there.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.750
You... You go to hell.

04:10.792 --> 04:15.542
God, we thank you for giving this child a life.

04:15.625 --> 04:19.958
Today, in front of you and these witnesses,

04:20.458 --> 04:23.458
this faith-hearing child is baptized.

04:24.167 --> 04:25.167
Amen.

04:34.042 --> 04:36.167
Here the imperial family,

04:36.708 --> 04:38.500
please stand up.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.000
Here the prince.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.833
Please stand up.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.958
We are very glad to have Mr. Paul Ahn,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.583
our most honorable Michelin 3-star

05:02.625 --> 05:04.042
chef from Art Nouveau

05:04.458 --> 05:06.375
as our chef today.

05:30.583 --> 05:33.500
Could you please tell us more
about this fine delicacy?

05:34.333 --> 05:36.375
My mother inspired me to make this dish.

05:37.125 --> 05:40.000
In Eastern tradition, red eggs symbolize

05:40.083 --> 05:41.833
the blessing to newborn babies.

05:42.208 --> 05:45.000
Let's wish the little prince
a happy and healthy life.

05:45.583 --> 05:46.583
Please enjoy.

06:25.583 --> 06:26.583
Paul,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.792
I just want you to know
how very proud we are of you

06:30.833 --> 06:33.583
and all that you have done for the company.

06:34.208 --> 06:35.583
The royal banquet

06:35.625 --> 06:37.333
is one for the books,

06:37.375 --> 06:38.375
thank you.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.875
I got some great news for you,

06:41.917 --> 06:43.667
and I think today,

06:44.333 --> 06:46.375
is the best occasion to announce it.

06:46.750 --> 06:51.167
The company has decided to formally appoint you

06:51.792 --> 06:57.833
as the executive chef of
the entire Art Nouveau franchise.

06:58.750 --> 06:59.958
Congratulations.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.167
I am a mix.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.458
My father is Korean

07:16.000 --> 07:17.500
and my mother is Chinese.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.583
My root, my consanguinity

07:19.667 --> 07:20.833
is from the East.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.833
There are dozens of
Michelin restaurants in France,

07:26.250 --> 07:27.958
and being the head chef at Art Nouveau

07:28.375 --> 07:29.375
is no longer

07:30.792 --> 07:31.792
my ultimate goal.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.292
I have decided to leave

07:34.708 --> 07:36.500
and to pursue a higher and bigger ambition.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.417
I've just got an invitation from China,

07:39.958 --> 07:42.417
asking me and Mayo to open

07:43.167 --> 07:45.083
our very first restaurant there.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.042
- What?
- You guys keep going,

07:48.083 --> 07:50.458
and we will definitely meet again someday.

08:01.292 --> 08:02.250
POng!

08:02.292 --> 08:03.458
You want this tile?

08:10.750 --> 08:13.042
- Uni, still busy?
- Lin.

08:13.208 --> 08:14.875
- Your package arrives, here.
- Thanks.

08:18.458 --> 08:19.458
Hey, Lin.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.042
Are the Chinese hairy crabs
that sold online fresh?

08:22.083 --> 08:23.083
Of course!

08:23.500 --> 08:24.583
If you place order tonight,

08:24.625 --> 08:25.833
you'll receive it tomorrow morning.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.792
- That soon.
- Customer always comes first.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.958
Then I'll place order.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.708
Good, get back to your stuff, I better go.

08:31.375 --> 08:32.375
- Thank you.
- See you.

08:33.292 --> 08:34.625
- Li.
- What's up?

08:34.667 --> 08:36.125
Doesn't your wife
want you to get back home before 10?

08:36.667 --> 08:37.582
I don't give a damn to her.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.042
Wait, Kong!

08:39.082 --> 08:40.082
Li.

08:40.292 --> 08:42.332
If you don't come back,
lam going to beat the hell out of you.

08:42.582 --> 08:43.542
I am coming back...

08:43.582 --> 08:45.083
- Don't...
- Excuse me.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.708
- Excuse me.
- We even haven't finished 8 rounds.

08:46.917 --> 08:47.917
Really leave?

08:48.125 --> 08:49.042
- Let me cover for him then.
- Hurry...

08:49.125 --> 08:50.083
I have been watching for that long,

08:50.125 --> 08:51.833
- you guys are really suck.
- Hurry up, I am about to win.

08:52.208 --> 08:54.167
Come on Sky, get a dozen more of Budweiser.

08:54.417 --> 08:55.667
- My treat.
- Your treat?

08:55.833 --> 08:56.833
Any good thing happens?

08:56.917 --> 08:58.125
Let me tell you something.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.375
I had dinner with the chief district officer
a few days ago,

09:00.833 --> 09:01.833
he told me that

09:01.958 --> 09:03.542
there will be a large-scale reform in Spring Avenue.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.375
- Really?
- Really.

09:05.542 --> 09:07.792
Stores that adapt the new development, stay.

09:07.833 --> 09:08.833
Those cannot,

09:09.125 --> 09:10.417
even they are old stores, leave.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.792
He keeps showing off the dinner
with the chief district officer.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.625
I even dance with the chief district officer.

09:16.125 --> 09:17.167
You two are pretty awesome.

09:17.792 --> 09:18.708
I am not joking.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.625
You see that the surroundings are mostly torn down,

09:21.083 --> 09:22.667
Spring Avenue will be the next.

09:24.792 --> 09:27.375
We will have to leave after this round.

09:36.125 --> 09:37.125
Uni.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.583
I go make some night snacks for Granny Zhang,

09:38.917 --> 09:39.917
then I will send her home.

10:21.292 --> 10:22.375
This fillet congee,

10:22.417 --> 10:23.417
eat it when it is still hot when you are back.

10:23.458 --> 10:24.500
It doesn't taste good when it gets cold.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.583
Okay, I know, Seven.

10:29.208 --> 10:30.708
I have told you that I am not Seven.

10:32.333 --> 10:33.417
You are not Seven?

10:33.583 --> 10:34.833
Are you Sky then?

10:36.208 --> 10:40.167
I remember both you and your master.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.833
- Okay okay.
- You two can't fool me.

10:44.750 --> 10:45.750
I am almost there.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.500
Let me walk you up.

10:47.708 --> 10:48.875
No need.

10:49.417 --> 10:51.833
You get back to home as soon as possible, Seven.

10:51.875 --> 10:53.333
- Fine, okay, okay.
- I am leaving.

10:53.625 --> 10:54.625
It's late...

10:55.167 --> 10:56.667
- Go, go.
- Just go.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.083
I am not Seven.

11:20.042 --> 11:21.000
Little White, Little Yellow.

11:21.042 --> 11:23.167
We have Eight ingredient beef shank
and fish skin congee today.

11:23.833 --> 11:24.833
Not ready yet.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
Just a little bit more...

11:27.292 --> 11:28.292
A little bit...

11:53.708 --> 11:55.208
Don't you ever come to the kitchen again!

11:55.500 --> 11:56.542
Why?

11:56.792 --> 11:58.292
You have no talent to be a chef!

11:58.875 --> 12:00.333
But you have not even tried.

12:00.792 --> 12:01.833
It's not necessary.

12:02.292 --> 12:03.333
To make fine food,

12:04.333 --> 12:05.292
besides using your tongue,

12:05.375 --> 12:07.667
you still have to use your eyes, nose and heart.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.792
You cannot even cut a green onion.

12:09.833 --> 12:10.875
You have no talent.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.750
Don't you tell people that you are my son.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.208
Eat up the noodles that made by you.

12:27.625 --> 12:28.625
Leave nothing.

12:29.792 --> 12:30.792
Eat.

12:40.417 --> 12:41.375
Are you seriously keeping him?

12:42.250 --> 12:43.250
No choice.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.500
We don't know the situation over there.

12:45.542 --> 12:46.542
There is no choice.

12:47.458 --> 12:48.458
I understand.

12:49.292 --> 12:50.750
You'll have him back after settling down.

12:52.167 --> 12:53.167
Urn.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.625
Okay, Daddy is leaving.

12:57.958 --> 12:59.583
You stay with Uncle Seven and be good.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.167
When will you come back?

13:01.208 --> 13:02.208
As soon as possible.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.208
I hate you, I hate you.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.250
Don't!

13:10.875 --> 13:11.792
Go away

13:11.833 --> 13:12.958
and don't ever come back!

13:50.542 --> 13:51.792
Boss, buying fish?

13:52.333 --> 13:53.458
Do you have giant groupers here?

13:53.875 --> 13:54.792
I want it.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.917
No.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.292
How about horse-head?

13:57.333 --> 13:58.292
We just caught it this morning.

13:58.792 --> 13:59.583
Get two of them?

13:59.625 --> 14:01.458
Horse-head is too muddy taste.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.542
Can't use them if just caught in this morning.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.625
You can...

14:04.708 --> 14:05.875
- It doesn't matter.
- Morning brother Sheng.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.750
- Morning.
- Do you have it?

14:07.833 --> 14:09.292
Yes of course, look!

14:10.000 --> 14:11.292
Look...How big it is.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.333
So fresh.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.958
This one is at least 8 catty?

14:15.042 --> 14:17.708
- You are good, this one is big and fresh.
- Just buy it.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.042
Boss, didn't you just say you don't have it?

14:21.583 --> 14:22.792
This big giant grouper,

14:22.833 --> 14:24.667
only he can handle it best in our neighborhood.

14:24.833 --> 14:26.125
It is a waste if I sell it to you.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.750
I can't buy it because I am not a good cook?

14:31.792 --> 14:32.833
Who set this rule?

14:33.167 --> 14:34.292
I asked to have it first.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.708
It should be first-come first-served.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.875
It is a waste if you can't make it best.

14:38.042 --> 14:39.750
And I truly don't have
this giant grouper everyday.

14:40.167 --> 14:41.667
- Please buy it next time.
- Here, brother Sheng, I am in a hurry.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.917
Okay, here you go.

14:59.458 --> 15:01.500
He said that only you can handle this fish best,

15:02.333 --> 15:03.375
how would you cook it?

15:12.750 --> 15:14.458
Take out only the middle part of the fish,

15:15.000 --> 15:16.083
using the fermented bean curd sauce.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.042
Chinese prickly ash, star anise, Sichuan pepper,

15:19.375 --> 15:21.208
clove and cinnamon,
marinate it until it is thoroughly soaked.

15:21.542 --> 15:22.667
Then use shallot to wrap up the fillet

15:22.917 --> 15:26.167
and flame-cook it until it is crispy and tender.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.417
I think you should use fennel,

15:38.042 --> 15:39.042
carrot,

15:39.208 --> 15:40.958
blood orange, and scallion as the base.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.750
Seasoning the fillet with salt and black pepper.

15:46.542 --> 15:47.792
Wrap it with baking paper

15:48.292 --> 15:49.750
and lastly, add the sage.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.833
Pour into the white wine
and roast it to enhance the flavor.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.333
White meat served with white wine.

15:53.917 --> 15:56.000
It utterly keeps the freshness of the fish.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.417
Two great chefs, please just leave me alone.

16:02.667 --> 16:03.667
You two share it.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.500
The middle line
of the table cloth has to be aligned.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.375
The length of the drop cloth has to be the same.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.250
The distance between plates
and the edge of the table

16:16.250 --> 16:17.250
has to be 1cm.

16:36.958 --> 16:38.792
Handsome, can I get some water to wash my hands?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.375
Sure, of course.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.125
- Come, come wash your hands.
- Thank you.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.458
Showtime?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.333
Yes, we are in a rush, have to leave first.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.000
- That soon? Just leave like this.
- Bye-bye.

16:48.542 --> 16:49.542
Quick.

17:02.375 --> 17:03.375
Nice.

17:09.541 --> 17:10.708
Move away.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.000
Who do you think that they will invite

17:14.041 --> 17:15.708
for the ribbon-cutting ceremony?

17:16.125 --> 17:17.833
When do you start following famous people?

17:18.875 --> 17:20.583
Do you think that they are

17:20.708 --> 17:22.333
going to affect our business?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.500
The feng shui of that place is bad,

17:24.541 --> 17:25.916
it changed 4 or 5 bosses,

17:25.958 --> 17:27.500
let's see how long they can support.

17:32.958 --> 17:33.958
The boss is coming.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.292
Boss,heHo“.

17:46.542 --> 17:50.375
Welcome...

17:51.417 --> 17:53.625
Welcome...

17:53.667 --> 17:56.167
- Welcome...
- Chariman.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.208
The chairman of delicacy.

17:57.292 --> 17:59.292
Welcome...

18:01.208 --> 18:02.833
Good day Mr. and Mrs. Chairman.

18:03.042 --> 18:04.292
Everyone, welcome to Stellar.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.792
Jia-cong, I come here

18:05.833 --> 18:08.000
mainly to show my gratitude to the Li's Group,

18:08.167 --> 18:10.042
to your outstanding contribution to our town.

18:10.417 --> 18:12.167
- Don't be too extravagant,
- Yes.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.333
Simple dishes are just fine.

18:13.458 --> 18:14.667
Simple dishes.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.542
The decoration is very sophisticated.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.292
Please take a seat.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Please take a seat.

18:21.458 --> 18:22.333
What would you like to eat madam,

18:22.375 --> 18:24.583
just feel free to order.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.417
Paul, Mr. and Mrs. Chairman are here.

18:32.458 --> 18:33.458
Please come out.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.667
This is our 3-starred chef,

18:37.417 --> 18:41.250
Paul Ahn.

18:43.292 --> 18:45.458
Today, I have prepared Carpaccio for everyone.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.542
Tuna is cooked with Manuka honey.

18:47.792 --> 18:48.792
I hope you all enjoy.

18:49.167 --> 18:50.167
- Good.
- Please wait a second.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.333
We go to prepare.

18:53.083 --> 18:56.042
- The Seven Anniversary Big Promotion.
- The Seven Promotion.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.792
- All dishes are 5 dollars only!
- Come and see.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.917
- Everyone, don't miss this bargain.
- It's wise to come and taste.

19:00.958 --> 19:02.375
Just 5 dollars for all you can eat!

19:02.458 --> 19:03.708
Please come!

19:03.750 --> 19:05.542
- Just click a "like" if you don't have money...
- Stop the brawling.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.250
- What?
- The Seven anniversary promotion...

19:07.292 --> 19:08.750
The Seven anniversary promotion...

19:09.208 --> 19:10.500
Do you own this street?

19:10.667 --> 19:11.667
What do you guys want?

19:11.833 --> 19:12.833
Move away.

19:12.917 --> 19:14.208
Excuse me.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.250
Nothing.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.125
What?

19:18.292 --> 19:19.333
Stop it, stop arguing.

19:20.417 --> 19:21.583
What's going on?

19:22.667 --> 19:23.750
This street

19:23.875 --> 19:26.333
is co-owned by all the neighbors in Spring Avenue.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.167
Either this road or that tree are ours.

19:29.458 --> 19:30.750
If you need to do business,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.792
you at least need to earn our respect.

19:33.875 --> 19:34.875
Listen up.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.792
We have brought

19:37.042 --> 19:39.333
the world most first-classed chef

19:39.792 --> 19:41.375
to run this restaurant here,

19:41.500 --> 19:44.458
as to make this neighborhood
with a little bit more class.

19:45.750 --> 19:46.833
But you guys,

19:47.167 --> 19:48.083
I know,

19:48.167 --> 19:49.208
you guys are afraid us

19:49.250 --> 19:50.875
winning over your customers
and therefore to make a scene here.

19:51.417 --> 19:54.375
I am telling you, this society is ruled by law.

19:54.458 --> 19:55.875
Okay okay... What?

19:56.125 --> 19:58.042
The world most first-classed chef?

19:59.250 --> 20:01.583
- Who are you trying to scare?
- That's right.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.708
We both run restaurants,

20:03.750 --> 20:05.333
let's compete with the culinary art.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.458
Let's compete, with whom?

20:07.833 --> 20:09.875
Definitely not him, with me...

20:11.417 --> 20:12.375
You?

20:12.417 --> 20:13.417
What's going on?

20:13.667 --> 20:15.208
Sky is back...

20:15.250 --> 20:16.208
- Sky is back...
- Let's compete.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.583
- This is our chef.
- What's the matter?

20:17.625 --> 20:19.292
- Fight against him, win him.
- Let's start.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.083
- Compete how?
- Paul Ahn.

20:27.917 --> 20:31.625
Our Michelin 3-star chef who is from France.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.292
He is from Seven,

20:33.375 --> 20:35.792
- starful...
- chef.

21:15.833 --> 21:17.333
Very quick.

21:23.333 --> 21:24.333
Amazing.

21:40.833 --> 21:41.833
Pretty clean.

22:34.542 --> 22:36.167
Fabulous, it is spectacular.

22:36.375 --> 22:37.958
This, a cosmopolitan restaurant.

22:38.208 --> 22:39.958
And this, our local time-honored shop.

22:40.417 --> 22:43.042
I heard that both of you two
have signed up for the

22:43.250 --> 22:45.417
International Chef Challenge Competition.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.833
In a way that the result of the competition

22:47.875 --> 22:49.417
will straightly affect our Spring Avenue's

22:49.458 --> 22:50.750
future development plan.

22:51.125 --> 22:52.792
- Either to tear down our old buildings...
- What plan?

22:52.833 --> 22:54.583
As to create an international commercial zone,

22:54.625 --> 22:56.500
or to keep our old buildings,

22:56.625 --> 22:57.917
to develop our local culture,

22:58.042 --> 23:00.042
it all depends on the result of this competition.

23:00.292 --> 23:02.208
Both of you, please take a step to here,

23:10.500 --> 23:11.708
in the coming competition,

23:11.750 --> 23:13.417
- Can you translate a bit?
- The two of you will be competitors.

23:13.708 --> 23:15.167
- But today, both of you are
- In fact, if

23:15.208 --> 23:16.708
- the members of Spring Avenue,
- we win the competition,

23:16.750 --> 23:18.042
- Seven is still Seven.
- we are family.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.083
- If we lose,
- Come,

23:19.125 --> 23:20.125
- Seven will...
- take out your hands,

23:20.167 --> 23:21.167
and shake.

23:25.250 --> 23:27.125
- Applaud.
- Good.

23:27.167 --> 23:28.917
We wish both of them

23:29.125 --> 23:30.125
will get a good result in the competition.

23:33.125 --> 23:34.458
Great...

23:37.042 --> 23:38.042
It's freshly new.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.417
This episode, "Chef please"

23:43.458 --> 23:45.750
is introducing the genuine

23:45.792 --> 23:47.500
Michelin 3-star chef.

23:47.958 --> 23:49.083
He is Paul Ahn.

23:49.917 --> 23:50.917
He is from Europe,

23:51.458 --> 23:55.417
and he is also the founder
and head chef of Stellar.

23:56.167 --> 23:57.208
Now we are going to see

23:57.500 --> 23:59.667
how he makes such a star-rated cuisine.

23:59.792 --> 24:00.792
Here.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.667
It is truly very beautiful.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.167
What is the name of this dish?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.458
This is today's main dish.

24:14.833 --> 24:15.708
French Escargots.

24:15.750 --> 24:18.042
And this time, Stellar is also shortlisted

24:18.083 --> 24:20.167
in the final competition of "Chef please".

24:20.625 --> 24:23.542
And which 2 restaurants
will be competing in the final?

24:23.792 --> 24:25.792
That will be decided by your vote.

24:26.292 --> 24:28.667
Chinese food culture is so profound and deep.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.417
You came to China

24:30.500 --> 24:31.708
and what do you gain?

24:32.208 --> 24:33.208
Honestly,

24:33.708 --> 24:34.708
nothing.

24:34.833 --> 24:36.125
Although Chinese cuisine has a very long history,

24:36.667 --> 24:37.875
it is very conservative.

24:38.208 --> 24:39.250
There is no transformation.

24:39.833 --> 24:41.667
The cooking method of Mapo Tofu 300 years ago

24:41.750 --> 24:42.750
is just same as the current method.

24:43.083 --> 24:44.083
There is no breakthrough,

24:44.542 --> 24:45.542
I am bored.

24:46.208 --> 24:47.208
Yet, western cuisine is different.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.500
It evolves with the times.

24:48.708 --> 24:49.750
It keeps infusing new technology

24:50.167 --> 24:51.000
and merge into the food.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.917
It keeps innovating and improving.

24:53.458 --> 24:54.750
This Michelin.

24:55.167 --> 24:56.333
You need to make-up for getting into the kitchen?

24:56.667 --> 24:58.167
Don't make me.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.333
I think they might just probably don't understand.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.833
He looks only know
how to do a facial and a manicure.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.208
How's the taste? Please enjoy.

25:09.042 --> 25:10.042
Thank you.

25:10.792 --> 25:12.417
Just served, please try.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.833
The Chinese style escargot. Let's try.

25:17.708 --> 25:18.708
Try and sees if you like it?

25:20.542 --> 25:21.875
It should be more or less same as Stellar

25:21.917 --> 25:22.917
How did you do it?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.042
My master is the King of Flavor.

25:25.167 --> 25:26.917
My sense of taste would not be bad either.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.708
And the key point of this dish

25:29.250 --> 25:30.542
is the ingredient.

25:31.875 --> 25:33.167
The meat of the escargots is so fleshy.

25:33.500 --> 25:34.625
And the combination of the sauces

25:35.000 --> 25:36.125
determines the taste of the dish.

25:37.208 --> 25:38.500
Yet, it is not easy

25:38.833 --> 25:39.833
to make exactly the same texture.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.750
They should have simmered and roasted it slowly.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.458
Yet I stir fried it with high temperature.

25:45.750 --> 25:46.750
There is still a little bit difference.

25:46.875 --> 25:47.875
Brother Sky!

25:48.000 --> 25:49.125
What did you made?

25:49.667 --> 25:50.708
Escargots, try it.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.917
You haven't eaten it, try.

25:52.542 --> 25:53.542
Let me try it.

25:54.042 --> 25:55.042
Good stuff.

25:59.583 --> 26:00.542
How is it?

26:00.583 --> 26:01.833
I prefer stir fried field snails.

26:02.458 --> 26:03.708
- Really?
- I like field snail more.

26:03.875 --> 26:05.542
Sky, give me two more plates of field snail

26:05.625 --> 26:06.625
and two beers.

26:07.125 --> 26:08.000
Got it.

26:08.042 --> 26:09.042
- Thank you.
- Right away.

26:39.125 --> 26:40.125
What's up?

26:51.167 --> 26:53.083
Silly, are you rambling again?

26:55.167 --> 26:56.750
I am not rambling.

26:57.042 --> 26:58.708
I am just worried.

27:00.792 --> 27:02.292
What are you worried about?

27:03.708 --> 27:04.958
Although Hai said

27:05.042 --> 27:06.250
he liked field snails more.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.625
But you see,

27:07.833 --> 27:09.792
Customers are really fewer than before.

27:11.708 --> 27:14.042
How much of a plate of field snail that we sell?

27:17.208 --> 27:18.208
How about them?

27:23.500 --> 27:24.625
But do you think

27:24.917 --> 27:26.958
can escargot compare with field snail?

27:28.042 --> 27:29.875
- No.
- That's right.

27:30.625 --> 27:31.667
Seven and Stellar,

27:32.167 --> 27:33.500
is just same as field snail and escargot.

27:34.375 --> 27:35.375
People who like field snail

27:35.583 --> 27:36.708
do not necessarily like escargot.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.083
People who like escargot

27:38.208 --> 27:39.417
also do not necessarily like field snail.

27:39.958 --> 27:41.042
Therefore we cannot compare.

27:42.333 --> 27:43.333
But,

27:44.375 --> 27:45.375
What they understand,

27:45.833 --> 27:46.833
I understand too.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.208
Seven has opened for so many years,

27:50.958 --> 27:52.083
it feels like that

27:52.125 --> 27:53.375
it is the canteen of Spring Avenue.

27:54.125 --> 27:55.208
What we make

27:55.458 --> 27:57.042
is the family dish that neighbors like.

27:57.667 --> 27:58.833
If we suddenly change it.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.542
Or even change it to Michelin-style,

28:00.792 --> 28:01.833
they won't get used to it.

28:04.542 --> 28:05.875
We only cook for

28:06.083 --> 28:07.250
one goal,

28:07.792 --> 28:09.667
which is people can eat our dishes happily.

28:10.042 --> 28:11.042
And anything else,

28:11.875 --> 28:12.917
just leave it.

28:26.417 --> 28:27.417
Brother Sheng.

28:27.875 --> 28:28.875
Fish?

28:29.042 --> 28:30.042
Sold out.

28:30.750 --> 28:31.750
To whom?

28:32.708 --> 28:33.792
To the Stellar.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.292
They doubled the price.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.625
- So I sold to them.
- Cool, good for them...

28:38.125 --> 28:40.417
I don't feel good, but you know,
it's just business.

28:40.458 --> 28:42.333
It's alright, just keep some for me next time.

28:42.375 --> 28:43.417
Sure, no problem.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
- See you.
- Okay.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.083
Bye-bye.

29:01.750 --> 29:02.542
- What do you want?
- Go away.

29:02.583 --> 29:03.583
- Stop making trouble.
- Hey!

29:03.750 --> 29:05.000
Whose car is it out there?

29:05.042 --> 29:07.167
It stops at the crossroads and it blocks us.

29:07.292 --> 29:08.833
- It stops at the junction.
- Keep it down, calm down.

29:08.875 --> 29:10.292
You guys are crossing the line.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.667
It doesn't just happen once or twice.

29:11.708 --> 29:12.917
- Please listen to me.
- The car parked at our area.

29:12.958 --> 29:14.292
- How can we do our business?
- I am sorry.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.917
- Take a look, it just parked right here.
- I am sorry.

29:16.958 --> 29:17.833
Where can our customers be seated?

29:17.833 --> 29:18.292
What now?

29:18.292 --> 29:19.500
Can you please calm down and let me explain?

29:19.708 --> 29:20.500
Come on.

29:20.542 --> 29:21.500
- I am sorry.
- Hello.

29:21.583 --> 29:22.417
How can I help you?

29:22.458 --> 29:24.208
- Your car, how can you park like this?
- What's the matter?

29:24.583 --> 29:25.500
Their car block this place.

29:25.542 --> 29:26.542
We can't place our tables.

29:26.708 --> 29:28.667
Your car does block our store's area.

29:28.958 --> 29:30.125
Customer will leave when they finish the meal.

29:30.458 --> 29:31.625
They will leave after finish?

29:31.708 --> 29:33.708
So we just open our store
after they finish the meal?

29:34.625 --> 29:35.667
It's just too outrageous!

29:35.708 --> 29:36.625
- Forget about it...
- Just move it

29:36.667 --> 29:37.958
or I will crush your car!

29:39.458 --> 29:40.458
Who do you think you are?

29:44.958 --> 29:45.958
Hurry up, Uni.

29:46.125 --> 29:47.250
Chef please is starting.

29:48.958 --> 29:50.542
According to the votes of the public,

29:50.750 --> 29:52.958
shortlisted restaurants
to the final of the "Chef please"

29:53.083 --> 29:54.083
is made.

29:54.167 --> 29:57.417
It will be Stellar competing with Seven.

29:58.208 --> 30:00.042
We would like to tell everyone a good news.

30:00.083 --> 30:01.292
Sevenisin!

30:01.333 --> 30:02.792
The winner

30:02.875 --> 30:04.250
- Seven.
- can challenge the two-time champion

30:04.292 --> 30:06.333
in a row of the world delicacy,

30:06.583 --> 30:07.583
Mr. Mountain K0.

30:07.625 --> 30:10.292
Is it true? Culinary competition.

30:16.250 --> 30:17.417
Sky...

30:17.792 --> 30:19.208
The god of cookery is my idol.
I love him the most.

30:19.542 --> 30:21.000
You have to take us to Macau

30:21.083 --> 30:21.958
to see the god of cookery.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.625
The god of cookery...

30:26.833 --> 30:28.125
A significant event in the F&B industry,

30:28.208 --> 30:29.708
the International culinary competition,

30:29.750 --> 30:32.708
will be held at the City of Dreams in Macau.

30:32.917 --> 30:34.625
I believe that all of you would like to
know the story of

30:34.917 --> 30:37.375
the two-times champion in a row
of the world delicacy.

30:37.833 --> 30:38.792
Today, we are happy to have

30:38.833 --> 30:41.125
Mr. Mountain K0 here

30:41.167 --> 30:42.375
and have an interview with us.

30:43.292 --> 30:44.292
Hello, Mr. K0.

30:44.458 --> 30:45.458
Hello.

30:45.542 --> 30:47.542
- Hello.
- What's your feeling right now?

30:48.417 --> 30:49.417
What's my feeling right now?

30:50.375 --> 30:52.000
I am okay, already get used to it.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.042
So, what is your expectation of the candidates

30:54.083 --> 30:55.083
of this competition?

30:55.417 --> 30:57.500
I hope the standard of the candidates
can be raised a bit more.

30:57.667 --> 30:58.667
So, Mr. K0,

30:58.792 --> 31:01.417
what do you think the reasons why that
few Chinese chefs

31:01.542 --> 31:03.875
could have won in international
culinary competitions?

31:05.083 --> 31:06.292
Because they are not as talented as I am.

31:07.958 --> 31:09.667
Mr. K0, we know that you are from Shunde,

31:09.708 --> 31:12.875
there is a long-faced talented chef in Shunde
and his surname is also K0,

31:12.917 --> 31:14.625
his name is Sky K0. Do you know him?

31:16.125 --> 31:17.125
Although my surname is K0,

31:18.667 --> 31:20.125
there are so many people in the world
also named K0.

31:20.375 --> 31:22.167
I couldn't have known all the Kos.

31:22.375 --> 31:24.042
But a source told us that

31:24.083 --> 31:25.458
Sky K0 is actually your son.

31:27.708 --> 31:28.667
How dare you...

31:28.708 --> 31:30.083
asking a question like this.

31:30.375 --> 31:31.375
Mr.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.208
Do you want to cancel tonight's booking?

31:35.458 --> 31:36.458
Okay, it's alright.

31:38.625 --> 31:39.625
Miss Uni.

31:41.792 --> 31:44.292
Are you also tried of
eating your restaurant's western cuisine?

31:44.792 --> 31:47.417
You need to make a booking to eat at Seven.

31:47.875 --> 31:49.000
I think you misunderstand.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.250
I don't come for an argument today.

31:51.583 --> 31:52.625
I just want to give you this invitation.

31:53.417 --> 31:55.792
We'd like to invite you two to Stellar tonight,

31:57.458 --> 31:58.708
We hope that you will do us the honour.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.500
Go?

32:21.167 --> 32:22.167
Here.

32:30.125 --> 32:31.125
Please be seated.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.542
- I'll serve myself.
- Okay.

32:36.833 --> 32:39.250
Welcome to Stellar.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.375
This is tonight's special.

32:50.208 --> 32:53.208
Would you like me to explain?

32:53.542 --> 32:55.625
(France) We would like the chef's
recommendation for tonight, thank you.

32:59.542 --> 33:00.542
Okay.

33:01.542 --> 33:03.917
Olive oil is for the bread, it is healthier.

33:06.583 --> 33:07.583
Please wait.

33:11.875 --> 33:13.542
Do you really understand or pretend to understand?

33:13.917 --> 33:16.167
I just learnt this sentence in this morning.

33:16.208 --> 33:17.750
Wow! It's magnificent.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.208
Hello, this is your appetizer,

33:23.625 --> 33:24.625
please enjoy.

33:25.042 --> 33:27.083
Fried egg, seriously?

33:27.375 --> 33:28.792
What is it?

33:29.500 --> 33:30.958
How great is it about this fried egg?

33:31.458 --> 33:33.375
Are they looking down on us? It...

33:33.875 --> 33:34.917
Let's try first.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.125
It's not fried egg.

33:45.333 --> 33:46.333
What?

34:03.958 --> 34:04.958
Mango.

34:06.167 --> 34:07.250
Passion fruit.

34:08.458 --> 34:09.417
And wine.

34:09.458 --> 34:10.625
Iced coconut juice.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.500
How did he make it?

34:28.292 --> 34:30.167
How are you? This is the chef's recommendation.

34:31.250 --> 34:32.250
Please enjoy.

34:33.875 --> 34:35.083
What the...?

34:40.958 --> 34:42.167
It is raw vegan salad.

34:43.292 --> 34:44.375
You two haven't seen it, have you?

34:47.542 --> 34:48.542
Relax.

34:48.583 --> 34:50.833
All the ingredients are eatable.

34:53.083 --> 34:54.375
You wouldn't understand even if I explain to you.

35:05.292 --> 35:06.458
I come here to have dinner,

35:06.500 --> 35:07.542
not to watch you playing tricks.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.292
Get back to France if you just want to show off.

35:13.708 --> 35:14.667
Relax.

35:14.708 --> 35:15.708
That's okay.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.500
Everyone out first.

35:40.167 --> 35:41.500
This is Japanese A5 Wagyu.

35:42.792 --> 35:43.833
Any opinion?

35:45.458 --> 35:47.000
Sous vide at 57 degrees.

35:48.167 --> 35:49.375
It's actually not a big deal.

35:49.917 --> 35:50.917
But,

35:51.292 --> 35:52.333
That big piece of steak,

35:52.792 --> 35:53.958
it will get cold before I finish it.

35:54.708 --> 35:55.667
It won't be tasty,

35:55.708 --> 35:57.417
no matter how expensive the Wagyu is.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.375
Just same as your fried egg and salad,

36:01.083 --> 36:02.333
the food-plating is pretty,

36:02.875 --> 36:04.208
but you just can't keep the temperature.

36:07.042 --> 36:08.250
So, how would you handle it?

36:12.708 --> 36:13.708
Can it be used?

37:41.250 --> 37:42.250
Family dish.

37:43.542 --> 37:44.917
Sautéed sliced beef with onion.

38:51.375 --> 38:53.917
Do you know why I name this restaurant Stellar?

38:54.750 --> 38:56.292
In China,

38:56.583 --> 38:58.583
there are not many Michelin 3-star restaurants.

39:00.083 --> 39:01.458
It is because they are too conservative.

39:02.417 --> 39:04.333
They are unenterprising.

39:04.708 --> 39:06.250
I come here as to take the Michelin 3-star.

39:09.167 --> 39:10.708
Applewood smoked A5 Wagyu.

39:10.833 --> 39:12.625
After a long time of sous vide,

39:12.667 --> 39:13.792
the meat becomes so tender.

39:13.958 --> 39:15.625
And to match with the right wine,

39:15.667 --> 39:17.083
it's perfection.

40:12.042 --> 40:13.542
Don't you ever come inside the kitchen again.

40:14.167 --> 40:15.208
Why?

40:15.333 --> 40:16.667
You have no talent to be a chef.

40:23.417 --> 40:24.875
It is because they are too conservative.

40:25.417 --> 40:28.125
They are unenterprising.

40:40.833 --> 40:41.833
Hello?

40:42.583 --> 40:43.583
Master?

40:51.583 --> 40:52.583
We made an appointment.

40:52.917 --> 40:53.917
Just nearby.

40:54.125 --> 40:55.083
Is it really necessary to meet in person?

40:55.125 --> 40:56.083
What do you think?

40:57.083 --> 40:58.750
He is your biological son.

41:03.458 --> 41:05.000
It's because he is my biological son,

41:06.375 --> 41:07.583
that's why he is like me.

41:11.083 --> 41:12.583
The bad temper, stubborness and annoying.

41:14.167 --> 41:15.292
You didn't raise him,

41:15.625 --> 41:16.625
and you didn't allow him to go inside the kitchen.

41:17.333 --> 41:18.667
Enough“.

41:18.708 --> 41:20.250
You have wasted for 20 years.

41:23.167 --> 41:24.042
You think he is good?

41:24.125 --> 41:25.292
Let's not talk about the culinary skill.

41:28.167 --> 41:29.708
Regarding the personality,
he is a lot better than you.

41:33.417 --> 41:34.417
Your turn.

41:35.083 --> 41:36.083
Dodge again,

41:36.792 --> 41:37.792
always dodging.

41:39.792 --> 41:40.792
Master.

41:42.792 --> 41:43.792
Hello.

41:49.625 --> 41:50.625
Your father is back.

41:53.125 --> 41:54.125
He is not my father.

41:54.958 --> 41:56.583
If I do have a father, that would be you.

41:59.292 --> 42:01.083
Your puberty is way too long.

42:01.208 --> 42:02.208
You said it,

42:02.375 --> 42:03.375
you don't know me.

42:08.667 --> 42:09.708
I am the two-times

42:09.750 --> 42:12.583
champion in a row of the world delicacy.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.542
I don't want you to have any pressure.

42:14.792 --> 42:16.167
Is it that great to be the god of cookery?

42:16.708 --> 42:17.708
Do you feel embarrassed that

42:17.750 --> 42:19.042
people talk about Spring Avenue and talk about me?

42:19.750 --> 42:21.708
I bet your father doesn't feel this way.

42:21.750 --> 42:23.042
This is exactly how I feel.

42:23.083 --> 42:25.750
You stay out of it, stay out of it...

42:27.667 --> 42:28.833
I heard that there is a talented long-faced chef

42:28.875 --> 42:30.500
in Spring Avenue,

42:30.625 --> 42:31.542
it was you?

42:31.583 --> 42:32.583
Right?

42:33.625 --> 42:34.542
You look at him,

42:34.583 --> 42:36.083
he just looks exactly like me.

42:36.208 --> 42:37.208
Temper is bad,

42:37.250 --> 42:38.167
impulsive,

42:38.208 --> 42:39.667
such a long face.

42:40.667 --> 42:41.500
You just ask anyone out there,

42:41.542 --> 42:43.000
and who wouldn't know that I am your father.

42:44.125 --> 42:46.208
The only different thing is,

42:46.792 --> 42:47.792
I am braver.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.750
I am brave enough to go outside.

42:50.042 --> 42:51.667
And the most important point is

42:51.708 --> 42:52.833
lsucceeded.

42:54.625 --> 42:56.417
Why don't you first defeat me

42:56.833 --> 42:57.917
to prove that

42:58.000 --> 42:58.958
you are capable.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Okay?

43:00.167 --> 43:02.125
Otherwise, you are just a prat

43:02.167 --> 43:04.208
from a small store

43:04.458 --> 43:06.167
in Spring Avenue who wouldn't even dare

43:06.208 --> 43:08.167
to call his biological father "father".

43:12.250 --> 43:13.292
I am going to remember what you have just said

43:14.667 --> 43:16.083
and I will prove myself to you.

43:17.375 --> 43:18.625
People do not need to be that cruel,

43:19.375 --> 43:21.000
that arrogant to be succeeded.

43:21.917 --> 43:23.542
And the god of cookery

43:24.917 --> 43:26.042
can also come from a small store in Spring Avenue.

43:28.542 --> 43:29.542
Sky!

43:31.583 --> 43:32.917
Why do you have to be like this.

43:42.458 --> 43:43.875
- Hello, this is your package.
- Hello.

43:43.958 --> 43:45.542
- Thank you, good bye.
- Good bye.

43:47.250 --> 43:48.250
Paul.

43:53.417 --> 43:54.583
The additional order has arrived.

43:54.625 --> 43:55.625
It's all good now.

43:55.833 --> 43:57.667
You are not going to lose.

44:03.875 --> 44:05.375
Ladies and gentlemen,

44:05.375 --> 44:06.167
hello everyone,

44:06.167 --> 44:08.875
lam your host, MC Chen.

44:12.250 --> 44:14.708
Let me hear your applauds and noise okay?

44:16.125 --> 44:17.125
Welcome everyone.

44:17.250 --> 44:19.708
Hello to all the audiences here
and in front of the TV.

44:19.875 --> 44:21.917
Welcome watching the final of "Chef please"

44:22.125 --> 44:24.500
that is hosted by
the Southern Breeze Television and

44:24.792 --> 44:26.833
solely sponsored by the AUX Air-conditioning.

44:26.875 --> 44:27.875
I am MC Chen.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Welcome everyone.

44:31.875 --> 44:34.417
Your votes have been examined by our specialists,

44:34.625 --> 44:35.750
- It's very nervous.
- the two chefs

44:35.792 --> 44:37.375
that are standing on the stage tonight

44:37.792 --> 44:39.583
surprisingly are from the same district.

44:39.833 --> 44:41.250
Firstly, let's put our hands together for

44:41.292 --> 44:43.083
the chef of Stellar in Spring Avenue,

44:43.292 --> 44:45.208
Paul Ahn.

44:46.125 --> 44:47.125
Paul.

44:47.583 --> 44:49.250
- Paul.
- Yeah.

44:56.083 --> 44:57.042
Welcome Paul.

44:57.083 --> 45:00.583
He is a Michelin 3-star chef from Europe.

45:00.792 --> 45:01.875
And his opponent today,

45:01.917 --> 45:03.458
who is also from Spring Avenue,

45:03.667 --> 45:05.083
the chef of

45:05.083 --> 45:06.875
- the time-honored Seven.
- It's Sky.

45:07.083 --> 45:09.333
- Sky...
- Sky K0.

45:17.708 --> 45:20.250
You must win...

45:20.375 --> 45:22.500
The two chefs please go back to your working table

45:22.583 --> 45:23.875
and get ready for the competition, please.

45:26.792 --> 45:29.083
Today, the people who feel the most struggling

45:29.250 --> 45:30.667
should be our judges.

45:31.042 --> 45:32.875
We have the talented chef on the one side.

45:33.208 --> 45:34.167
And the other side,

45:34.208 --> 45:36.500
is the 3-star chef.

45:36.708 --> 45:38.000
So, how should we choose?

45:38.042 --> 45:39.500
Let's welcome our judges today.

45:39.542 --> 45:41.792
Welcome our beautiful MC, Yiyi.

45:42.042 --> 45:44.542
Well-known food critic, Mr. Benny Li.

45:44.583 --> 45:46.708
The master of Chaoshan cuisine, Xinmin Zhang

45:46.792 --> 45:48.958
The master of Huaiyang cuisine, Xiaoyan Zhou.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.458
Today's result will have to be
counted on the four of you.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.500
Today's rule,

45:54.792 --> 45:57.125
the two chefs

45:57.375 --> 45:58.625
have to finish their dishes

45:58.667 --> 46:00.458
in 90-minute,

46:00.500 --> 46:03.167
and it will be appraised by our four judges.

46:03.458 --> 46:04.583
Let me remind the two of you again,

46:04.958 --> 46:05.958
the winner

46:06.000 --> 46:07.500
today,

46:07.875 --> 46:09.375
next month, he will attend

46:09.875 --> 46:11.375
the world delicacy that to be held

46:11.417 --> 46:13.000
at the Studio City Event Center in Macau.

46:13.333 --> 46:16.792
And he also have a chance
to challenge the god of cookery.

46:17.083 --> 46:19.458
This is an absolute honor in the F&B industry.

46:19.500 --> 46:22.000
And I believe the two of us will grasp this chance.

46:22.333 --> 46:23.875
Let's put our hands together again for them.

46:26.333 --> 46:27.792
- Sky 90 for n!
- Cheer up!

46:27.833 --> 46:28.708
I now announce,

46:28.750 --> 46:31.000
the competition starts.

47:16.667 --> 47:17.667
The knife skill is breathtaking.

47:18.208 --> 47:19.333
He has the knowledge of Huaiyang cuisine.

47:19.458 --> 47:20.792
To make this stuffed duck,

47:20.875 --> 47:23.083
it requires a high-level of knife skill.

47:32.583 --> 47:33.667
The meat and bone are plainly separated.

47:34.167 --> 47:35.167
He has what it takes.

47:48.542 --> 47:49.542
What's the name?

48:09.375 --> 48:10.833
- Where is he?
- Why he left?

48:12.208 --> 48:13.208
Got scared?

48:17.833 --> 48:20.167
Isn't it against the rule of
using that large of pot?

48:21.292 --> 48:22.125
Don't worry boss,

48:22.208 --> 48:23.875
it's not necessary a good thing to use a large pot.

48:38.667 --> 48:40.083
His stability is not bad.

48:40.208 --> 48:41.833
He needs to be steady for this motion,

48:41.958 --> 48:43.917
otherwise the dish up will be sabotaged.

49:19.750 --> 49:21.125
Paul is poised.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.625
He must be very experienced in competitions.

49:24.083 --> 49:25.708
And take a look of how he cut the foie gras
with a hot knife,

49:26.375 --> 49:27.833
it's just purely art.

49:27.875 --> 49:28.833
The knife after getting heat,

49:28.875 --> 49:30.458
it slices even more smooth and neatly.

49:30.625 --> 49:31.875
The sliced foie gras

49:32.000 --> 49:33.458
is neater and more beautiful.

49:33.958 --> 49:35.125
It's just too pretty.

50:10.125 --> 50:11.375
That thing,

50:11.792 --> 50:14.292
is just same as the food that we had on that day.

50:14.500 --> 50:15.542
Cold.

50:15.750 --> 50:17.375
Good looking but not tasty.

50:17.667 --> 50:19.417
This is the food-plating of western cuisine.

50:19.750 --> 50:21.458
We rarely see it in Chinese cuisine.

51:10.125 --> 51:12.167
Audiences here and in front of the TV,

51:12.250 --> 51:13.667
we have now reached to

51:13.708 --> 51:15.417
the last few seconds of the final.

51:15.792 --> 51:18.167
Let's count down together.

51:19.125 --> 51:20.500
Five.

51:20.833 --> 51:21.958
Four.

51:22.000 --> 51:22.958
Three.

51:23.042 --> 51:23.958
Two.

51:24.042 --> 51:24.875
One.

51:24.917 --> 51:25.958
Time's up.

51:31.083 --> 51:34.333
- Sky...
- Paul...

51:34.375 --> 51:36.625
Let's have the dishes served.

51:37.917 --> 51:40.250
And please also
have your hands together again for

51:41.250 --> 51:42.250
Sky K0

51:42.667 --> 51:44.583
and Paul Ahn coming to the center of the stage.

51:47.917 --> 51:50.125
We now have Paul Ahn's dish
for the judges to taste.

51:50.292 --> 51:51.667
Paul, please do briefly introduce your dish to us.

51:52.417 --> 51:53.292
My dish's name is

51:53.333 --> 51:55.625
the French foie gras with caramel raspberry mousse.

51:56.333 --> 51:57.333
Please enjoy.

51:58.042 --> 51:59.167
The foie gras is very fleshy.

51:59.500 --> 52:01.083
The sweetness is just as good as it could be.

52:02.542 --> 52:04.833
The most special thing is the caramel
is not just a decoration.

52:05.083 --> 52:06.958
And how he made the mousse is ingenious too.

52:07.250 --> 52:09.417
It makes me feel the girly sweetness.

52:09.917 --> 52:12.208
Although the foie gras is traditional,

52:12.375 --> 52:14.083
he merged it with the flavor of sour and sweet.

52:14.250 --> 52:16.125
I think it is very creative and stunning too.

52:16.417 --> 52:18.958
This cuisine is
truly blending the east and the west.

52:19.292 --> 52:20.500
He mainly makes western cuisine.

52:20.625 --> 52:22.125
The pineapples down there,

52:22.167 --> 52:23.750
carry the flavor of sour
and sweet taste of the East.

52:24.667 --> 52:26.833
Serving together with the greasy foie gras,

52:26.875 --> 52:28.667
the crunchy caramel

52:28.917 --> 52:30.292
and the sweet and sour pineapples.

52:30.333 --> 52:32.750
All serving together, we felt stunning too.

52:34.375 --> 52:35.375
Go for it.

52:35.917 --> 52:37.375
Now please

52:37.417 --> 52:41.042
serve the dish that made by Sky K0 from Seven.

52:42.708 --> 52:44.208
Sky please briefly introduce the dish for us.

52:44.375 --> 52:46.333
Yin-yang Beggar's Duck.

52:49.458 --> 52:50.792
There is a lotus leaf,

52:51.083 --> 52:52.667
It is how you cook
the Hangzhou's "Beggar's Chicken".

52:52.792 --> 52:55.292
We now have both Jiangnan and Lingnan styles.

52:55.583 --> 52:56.708
The outside is salt baked.

52:56.750 --> 52:58.000
It is sort of a Cantonese-style.

52:58.042 --> 52:59.500
The duck meat is tender.

52:59.542 --> 53:02.125
When I eat it, I flashback

53:02.167 --> 53:04.500
the scene of his cooking

53:04.917 --> 53:06.667
The outside is the whitely salt,

53:06.792 --> 53:09.292
the flavor of the salt and ginger.

53:09.542 --> 53:10.750
When it is opened,

53:10.917 --> 53:12.250
There is the emerald green lotus leaf.

53:12.458 --> 53:14.792
This is the freshly sweetness of Jiangnan style.

53:15.083 --> 53:17.833
Lastly, there is the Yunnan snow lotus,

53:17.958 --> 53:20.583
the briskness that as on a snow mountain,

53:20.667 --> 53:22.625
all are blended into the fresh
and tender duck meat.

53:23.208 --> 53:25.792
That's why he names the dish "Yin-Yang".

53:25.833 --> 53:27.125
- Very meaningful.
- Totally agree.

53:27.167 --> 53:28.167
Good.

53:29.667 --> 53:30.875
This name is fierce enough.

53:32.792 --> 53:34.583
Boss Seven, congratulations.

53:34.792 --> 53:36.750
Sky K0 is a very talented chef.

53:36.792 --> 53:38.833
A strict teacher has the outstanding disciple,
right?

53:38.875 --> 53:39.833
- Right.
- Now,

53:39.875 --> 53:41.667
it's time for our four judges.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.583
It is the most struggling, painful

53:43.792 --> 53:45.458
and difficult moment to decide.

53:45.750 --> 53:47.375
Firstly, let's see

53:47.833 --> 53:49.208
Paul Ahn.

53:49.417 --> 53:50.625
The four judges,

53:51.083 --> 53:52.042
how are you going to score?

53:52.083 --> 53:53.250
Please look at the big screen.

53:55.125 --> 53:57.000
The score from the first judge is,

53:58.500 --> 53:59.500
The Second.

54:02.542 --> 54:03.542
The third.

54:04.208 --> 54:05.250
Still 9.

54:05.875 --> 54:07.000
The last one.

54:11.667 --> 54:12.792
10, full mark.

54:12.833 --> 54:16.125
It's fantastic.

54:17.167 --> 54:19.542
The total score of the four judges is

54:21.708 --> 54:23.292
This is a very high score.

54:23.458 --> 54:24.750
Congratulations Paul Ahn.

54:26.833 --> 54:28.292
I believe this score

54:28.333 --> 54:30.917
must give Sky K0 a lot of pressure.

54:31.125 --> 54:32.375
Now let's see

54:32.417 --> 54:34.167
Sky Ko's score.

54:35.833 --> 54:36.833
The first judge.

54:40.917 --> 54:42.625
10, the first judge already gave a 10.

54:42.667 --> 54:44.292
Unbelievable, the second judge.

54:45.417 --> 54:47.083
Still is 10, incredible.

54:47.458 --> 54:48.458
The third.

54:50.833 --> 54:52.083
Now the score is already 20.

54:52.125 --> 54:53.625
Two gave full marks and the third one,

54:56.167 --> 54:57.750
The score that now adding up among the 3 judges is

54:57.792 --> 54:59.750
- already 29.
- Just an illusion, it's alright.

54:59.792 --> 55:01.833
The last one is the most important.

55:07.833 --> 55:09.917
His score is

55:12.292 --> 55:13.417
The total score of the four judges

55:14.167 --> 55:16.833
to Sky K0 is

55:18.125 --> 55:20.708
- Good...
- Great!

55:20.750 --> 55:22.125
No problem...

55:22.167 --> 55:23.542
- Sky must win.
- Go you go!

55:23.583 --> 55:24.583
The competitors

55:24.625 --> 55:26.208
are really neck and neck.

55:26.833 --> 55:29.083
37 to 37.

55:29.625 --> 55:31.125
According to the rules of the competition,

55:31.417 --> 55:32.542
if we encounter

55:32.583 --> 55:33.583
a neck and neck situation

55:33.667 --> 55:35.292
at the final,

55:35.333 --> 55:37.417
we will need to have our chairman
of the judging panel,

55:37.458 --> 55:39.083
Benny Li, to make the final decision.

55:39.167 --> 55:40.167
Put your hands together please.

55:41.042 --> 55:43.500
Yeah“.

55:44.750 --> 55:48.333
Will he vote for Sky or Paul? Please...

55:49.167 --> 55:49.958
Actually,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.042
we haven't expected to this outcome.

55:52.292 --> 55:53.208
Frankly,

55:53.250 --> 55:54.500
the two chefs

55:54.583 --> 55:55.583
today are

55:55.667 --> 55:56.917
tremendously awesome.

55:57.083 --> 55:58.375
Especially Seven,

55:59.708 --> 56:00.625
- Good...
- This young guy

56:00.667 --> 56:01.667
- ls really talented.
- Wise choice.

56:01.708 --> 56:04.000
When I saw him cooking,

56:04.125 --> 56:06.167
he did cook like a grand master.

56:09.167 --> 56:10.167
But,

56:10.833 --> 56:12.917
why did I just give you an 8?

56:13.208 --> 56:14.208
It's because cooking,

56:14.250 --> 56:16.375
is not just simply having the food
ending up in a stomach.

56:16.750 --> 56:18.542
Especially for a competition like this,

56:18.583 --> 56:20.500
is more care about the color, aroma and taste.

56:20.792 --> 56:22.208
Cooking is an art,

56:22.500 --> 56:23.833
we need to respect the food

56:24.792 --> 56:26.333
and respect the industry,

56:27.375 --> 56:29.333
which include our own presence.

56:29.917 --> 56:32.125
The food-plating,

56:32.250 --> 56:33.583
you really need to

56:33.583 --> 56:35.583
treat it as a sacred matter.

56:35.792 --> 56:36.833
As for this point,

56:36.875 --> 56:37.917
Stellar,

56:38.042 --> 56:40.125
they did demonstrate nicely today.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.125
After the discussion among us,
we unanimously decide

56:43.583 --> 56:46.875
the winner of today's competition is

56:47.958 --> 56:48.958
Paul Ahn.

57:25.542 --> 57:26.917
It starts raining, come inside now.

57:27.833 --> 57:28.792
I want to learn cooking.

57:28.833 --> 57:30.000
If you don't teach me,

57:30.542 --> 57:31.542
I won't go inside.

57:33.833 --> 57:35.292
Why do you have to be a chef?

57:37.208 --> 57:38.250
Because I can't cook well,

57:38.542 --> 57:39.750
that's why he didn't take me with him.

57:41.458 --> 57:42.458
You think too much.

57:43.250 --> 57:44.167
He looks down on me.

57:44.417 --> 57:45.458
He thinks that I embarrass him

57:45.500 --> 57:46.500
this is why he left.

57:46.875 --> 57:47.667
Uncle Seven.

57:47.708 --> 57:49.167
Please teach me cooking, okay?

57:49.792 --> 57:50.792
Okay.

58:05.167 --> 58:06.167
Master.

58:07.958 --> 58:09.833
Sky is not here, let me cook.

58:09.958 --> 58:11.500
I used primordial energy to make this dish.

58:11.542 --> 58:13.542
Long-lived pan-fried noodles with beef.

58:13.792 --> 58:14.792
Try it.

58:19.250 --> 58:20.500
What a good kid you are.

58:22.333 --> 58:24.417
Seven is counting on you from now on.

58:25.750 --> 58:26.500
Master.

58:26.583 --> 58:29.083
If you like, I'll make you one more plate.

58:29.583 --> 58:30.583
Go make it.

58:33.708 --> 58:34.708
Master.

58:35.750 --> 58:37.542
How long has Sky left?

58:42.500 --> 58:43.667
2 days already.

58:45.583 --> 58:46.750
It's about time.

59:00.333 --> 59:01.333
Play a game?

59:19.958 --> 59:20.958
Can't win you.

59:22.208 --> 59:24.000
But winning or losing a battle
is a common occurrence.

59:24.042 --> 59:25.000
Right, Sky?

59:25.250 --> 59:26.708
You deliberately lose the game to me.

59:27.917 --> 59:29.583
I really haven't expected that
you could be playing TV games

59:29.625 --> 59:30.708
while lecturing me.

59:31.917 --> 59:33.083
Let's play something else then.

59:41.250 --> 59:43.000
Only you know where to find me.

59:43.208 --> 59:44.500
They know too.

59:44.708 --> 59:46.292
But I ask them not to.

59:54.125 --> 59:55.875
You have been travelling four seas almost a year,

59:56.750 --> 59:57.750
what have you seen?

59:58.542 --> 59:59.750
I have seen two little monks.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.708
I am hungry and I want to have a steamed bun.

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:06.333
Is this steamed bun good?

01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:07.958
Very good, you want one?

01:00:14.708 --> 01:00:16.000
So? Is it good?

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:19.333
Though the wheat is from Hetao.

01:00:20.792 --> 01:00:21.792
But,

01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:24.833
the time of fermentation is too long.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.375
The time of rubbing the dough is too short.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.208
The temperature of the steamer is too high.

01:00:31.042 --> 01:00:34.500
It has been 5 hours for the steaming until now.

01:00:35.542 --> 01:00:36.750
This steamed bun

01:00:37.042 --> 01:00:38.042
is just so-so.

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.750
Almsgiver is infinitely resourceful.

01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:41.000
Have a bite of the steamed bun

01:00:41.042 --> 01:00:43.833
and you can tell the whole story about it.

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:46.375
Almsgiver, who are you?

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.708
A foodie.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:51.250
A foodie?

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.958
But, I still think my steamed bun is more tasty.

01:00:58.042 --> 01:00:59.208
There is a thing

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.792
that you couldn't tell even after eating it.

01:01:01.042 --> 01:01:02.042
What is it?

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.333
This steamed bun,

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.083
I planted the wheat,

01:01:05.292 --> 01:01:06.625
I fermented the dough,

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:08.375
and I put the bun in the steamer by myself too.

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:10.208
Therefore, my master thinks

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.208
this is the most delicious steamed bun

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.708
that I have ever eaten.

01:01:13.292 --> 01:01:14.500
Well said.

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:25.625
After hearing their conversation,

01:01:27.833 --> 01:01:29.625
I almost took the two of them back.

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:35.833
I thought you would have got a wife back.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.417
Why do I need to get a wife?

01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:42.042
I already got you, Uni and those kids at Seven.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.875
But I have ruined the reputation of Seven,

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:53.167
and made that person look down on me.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.208
Why are you care about him so much?

01:02:00.333 --> 01:02:02.083
If you cannot get this out of your mind,

01:02:02.917 --> 01:02:05.000
you would never get out of your father's shadow.

01:02:15.542 --> 01:02:17.542
Cheers...

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Paul.

01:02:22.292 --> 01:02:23.292
I need to discuss something with you.

01:02:23.833 --> 01:02:24.792
Anything boss.

01:02:24.833 --> 01:02:25.833
Paul,

01:02:25.917 --> 01:02:26.917
well,

01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:28.417
it's about

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.667
you going to the competition in Macau.

01:02:31.333 --> 01:02:32.708
We have another thought.

01:02:34.458 --> 01:02:36.250
Do you have any new ideas? Let's think about it.

01:02:38.042 --> 01:02:41.042
We want Mayo to represent our restaurant.

01:02:42.417 --> 01:02:44.458
But Mayo is just my assistant.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.375
You still don't understand.

01:02:46.792 --> 01:02:48.083
What boss means

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.875
is letting Mayo to attend the competition.

01:02:50.417 --> 01:02:51.708
A pretty female chef

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:53.583
is definitely more eye-catching than you,

01:02:53.667 --> 01:02:54.667
don't you understand?

01:02:56.208 --> 01:02:57.208
Mayo now

01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:59.250
still doesn't attain the level as a head chef.

01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:02.500
Who say so?

01:03:11.792 --> 01:03:12.875
One bowl is with salt,

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:14.958
the other one is not.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.542
Can you tell which one is saltier?

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:27.125
But I won the competition.

01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:29.375
I made no mistakes.

01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:31.792
Try it.

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:38.583
You can fool the others,

01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:40.417
but can you fool yourself?

01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:43.083
Let me ask you,

01:03:43.667 --> 01:03:44.917
a person who loses the sense of taste,

01:03:45.292 --> 01:03:46.458
is he qualified to be a chef?

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.458
Trust me,

01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:52.875
I can.

01:03:53.833 --> 01:03:54.833
Without this ability,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
you still can?

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:58.792
Why that salty?

01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:00.083
Salty?

01:04:00.167 --> 01:04:01.167
Try it.

01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:06.000
Did you use the salted butter?

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:08.458
I wrongly used it.

01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:29.125
Right.

01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:31.125
Your recipe is truly amazing,

01:04:31.417 --> 01:04:34.125
but we think that anyone else can just follow it

01:04:34.167 --> 01:04:35.708
and will attain to your standard.

01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:37.000
At first we all thought that

01:04:37.042 --> 01:04:38.333
we could keep this secret for you

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.583
and let you attend the competition.

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:41.333
But...

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:49.125
To be honest with you,

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:51.792
Mayo is my girlfriend now

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.250
and I like her very much too.

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:02.750
Mayo.

01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:04.708
You thought that I am with you

01:05:05.042 --> 01:05:06.167
is because I love you?

01:05:08.292 --> 01:05:09.292
To be the god of cookery

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:11.167
is my ultimate dream.

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.417
I don't want to miss this opportunity.

01:06:00.917 --> 01:06:03.167
You win, but you are sadder than me.

01:06:08.417 --> 01:06:09.417
Do you know?

01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:12.625
This is my idol.

01:06:13.792 --> 01:06:15.125
The goal that I strive for.

01:06:17.042 --> 01:06:18.042
My father was a chef.

01:06:19.792 --> 01:06:20.792
The kimchi he made

01:06:20.833 --> 01:06:22.833
is the best in Seoul, no one can beat him.

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:27.583
I remember before my father died,

01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:30.250
he grabbed my hand

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:32.125
and told me to cook with heart.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.667
I want you to be the god of cookery,

01:06:33.792 --> 01:06:35.125
to achieve my dream.

01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:36.583
I couldn't have expected that

01:06:37.417 --> 01:06:39.125
I have no chance to challenge my idol again.

01:06:41.667 --> 01:06:42.958
You said that he is your idol.

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:46.292
He is my father.

01:06:49.708 --> 01:06:50.708
He is your father?

01:06:50.875 --> 01:06:51.875
Are you kidding me?

01:06:53.292 --> 01:06:54.292
It's true.

01:06:54.542 --> 01:06:55.542
Dark history.

01:06:55.792 --> 01:06:56.792
I think so too.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
He left me when I was ten.

01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:03.625
It has been 20 years.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.125
He now is

01:07:06.292 --> 01:07:07.292
the god of cookery,

01:07:10.917 --> 01:07:12.083
but I won't envy him.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.167
Because he is just a selfish bastard.

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:20.708
On the contrary, I have to challenge him.

01:07:21.292 --> 01:07:22.500
I have to prove him that

01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:24.083
it doesn't have to be a person like him

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:25.333
to be successful.

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:29.250
But,

01:07:30.292 --> 01:07:31.542
both of us are losers now.

01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:37.417
What's the matter with you?

01:07:39.958 --> 01:07:40.958
I got kicked out

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.458
by Jia-cong Li.

01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:51.542
So we are now

01:07:51.917 --> 01:07:53.000
neck and neck again.

01:07:56.792 --> 01:07:57.875
But I won't give up.

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:05.083
I won't give me either.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Bastard.

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.208
(Korean)

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:17.667
What does it mean?

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:21.167
Bastard, go to hell.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.542
(Korean) Bastard, go to hell.

01:08:25.457 --> 01:08:27.292
I always think that

01:08:27.582 --> 01:08:29.042
Chinese cuisine is tough and boring.

01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:34.167
But after I ate the Sautéed sliced beef
with onion that you made,

01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:35.625
I was shocked.

01:08:35.957 --> 01:08:36.957
It was good.

01:08:42.582 --> 01:08:43.625
On that day,
when you were removing the fish pin bone,

01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:44.917
you actually

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:47.417
missed one piece.

01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:51.582
Did I?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
How come?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.082
My eyes got problem too?

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.125
It's not true.

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.542
How could you be that serious?

01:09:01.417 --> 01:09:03.292
- Did I really miss it?
- It's not true.

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:05.250
- Really?
- It's not true.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.417
"Housing Acquisition Agreement"

01:09:29.917 --> 01:09:31.332
The conditions are the most favorable,

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:32.625
just sign it.

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:34.125
The government wouldn't really dismantle it?

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:35.207
Where else can we go for a drink
after it got torn down?

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.167
I won't leave.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:37.582
Even I need to die, I would die here.

01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:38.625
It's obviously a trap.

01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:39.542
- We don't fall for it.
- Exactly.

01:09:39.582 --> 01:09:40.667
- It has to be a trap.
- Not sign.

01:09:40.707 --> 01:09:41.582
Sign.

01:09:41.667 --> 01:09:43.332
He has been very stingy.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.542
It is a lot of money.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.292
Sky, don't you think so?

01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:51.042
We can't sign.

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:54.500
We can't sign.

01:09:54.542 --> 01:09:55.667
Tell them the consequences.

01:09:56.667 --> 01:09:58.417
If you don't sign the agreement,

01:09:58.542 --> 01:10:00.542
the Li's Group will apply for court warrant

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:01.542
of forced demolition order.

01:10:01.583 --> 01:10:03.917
By then, you will get nothing, not even a dime.

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:06.375
I don't like what you have just said.

01:10:06.917 --> 01:10:08.208
We also know the law.

01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:10.625
You are alarmist, are you trying to scare me?

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:13.083
It's good that you know the law,
please persuade them.

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:14.167
No need.

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:17.750
Please leave.

01:10:18.708 --> 01:10:19.708
Go.

01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:22.708
Are they forcing us to fight?

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:24.333
Who fought against whom?

01:10:24.875 --> 01:10:25.917
What if we don't buy the sweet talk,

01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:26.917
what would you do?

01:10:26.958 --> 01:10:29.542
- Sky is back...
- Sky...

01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:30.833
- Sky is home finally.
- Come out.

01:10:31.083 --> 01:10:32.208
Is he here too?

01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:34.542
- Master.
- It's good to have Sky back.

01:10:35.583 --> 01:10:36.583
Why are you here?

01:10:37.292 --> 01:10:38.625
I come to announce one thing,

01:10:40.042 --> 01:10:41.500
I will be joining Sky K0,

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:43.583
representing Seven to attend

01:10:43.625 --> 01:10:44.833
the International culinary competition.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.667
I am the winner,

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:48.417
Therefore the competition eligibility

01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:52.250
is not belonged to Stellar but me.

01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:54.792
I have the right

01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:56.708
to attend this competition.

01:11:00.917 --> 01:11:01.917
Is there a such rule?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.167
Don't be so naive.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:08.083
You know what?

01:11:08.708 --> 01:11:10.000
Your culinary career

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:11.375
is over.

01:11:12.417 --> 01:11:13.458
If I were you,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.792
I will get my ass back to Korea immediately.

01:11:16.125 --> 01:11:17.333
Have some kimchi.

01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:19.125
- What's the matter?
- I hate people stirring-up problems.

01:11:19.167 --> 01:11:20.958
- I won't stand for it.
- Exactly.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:21.792
Don't watch.

01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:22.833
Kimchi is almost finished.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:26.917
Yes...

01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:28.375
Just made it.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:29.833
You deserved it.

01:11:29.875 --> 01:11:31.875
I've just had my nose job.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.250
Hitting people is illegal.

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:45.833
A traitor.

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:48.875
Go away...

01:11:48.917 --> 01:11:50.333
- Here...
- We don't welcome you

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:51.917
We, the Li's Group,
sooner or later will tear it down.

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:53.833
Tear down.

01:11:54.042 --> 01:11:59.083
Tear down...

01:11:59.667 --> 01:12:02.125
- We don't want you here.
- Go away...

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:03.833
Sky.

01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:06.542
Is it true about what he said?

01:12:09.583 --> 01:12:10.792
Do you think thoroughly?

01:12:11.292 --> 01:12:12.792
I do think thoroughly.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:16.667
I want Sky and I

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.250
to attend this competition together.

01:12:20.333 --> 01:12:21.417
I am betrayed.

01:12:23.792 --> 01:12:24.917
I have to work with Sky

01:12:25.958 --> 01:12:27.000
as to have a chance to win.

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:30.458
Can I, master?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.417
You are the enemy's enemy,

01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:40.042
that makes you our friend.

01:12:40.125 --> 01:12:42.042
- Good...
- Welcome Paul to join us.

01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:43.083
You can.

01:12:45.375 --> 01:12:46.833
We are a family now.

01:12:48.333 --> 01:12:49.875
Chinese cuisine is more about the heat.

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:51.625
Let me show you a trick.

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:54.125
Open, close.

01:12:54.625 --> 01:12:55.875
Open, close.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Wait.

01:13:05.875 --> 01:13:07.292
It's just overwhelming.

01:13:09.875 --> 01:13:10.875
Oregano.

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:15.042
Italian black salt.

01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:15.917
No need to taste.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.042
Cantonese-style steamer.

01:13:18.083 --> 01:13:19.250
There are food on each tier.

01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:21.542
Chicken feet.

01:13:22.167 --> 01:13:23.167
Shrimp dumpling.

01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:26.792
What's the taste?

01:13:30.458 --> 01:13:31.542
There is something too.

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.375
Are you kidding me?

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.542
You try it first.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.500
Give me some opinion.

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:51.750
What are you looking?

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:53.958
Sometimes you need to abandon
the distracting thoughts

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.417
and just focus on one point.

01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:56.917
You will discover something different.

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:58.417
I got tired of it.

01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:03.458
I haven't had the sweet soup
that made by you for a long time.

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:05.083
Bean curd sheet ginkgo sweet soup.

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:07.833
Why is it so sweet?

01:14:07.958 --> 01:14:09.375
The ginkgo that I usually eat is bitter.

01:14:10.333 --> 01:14:11.333
See.

01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:19.667
If you keep things inside your heart,

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:21.792
you will feel bitter.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
It clears out the internal heat in your body.

01:14:29.875 --> 01:14:31.042
Master...

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.417
Yes?

01:14:38.417 --> 01:14:42.042
- What?
- Master, the water is boiling over.

01:15:55.125 --> 01:15:56.208
Ladies and Gentleman,

01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:57.750
welcome to the city of Macau,

01:15:57.792 --> 01:15:59.625
the vibrant gambling city of Asia.

01:15:59.917 --> 01:16:02.875
We are now live at the Studio City Event Center.

01:16:03.375 --> 01:16:05.000
Audiences here on-the-scene
and in front of the TV,

01:16:05.042 --> 01:16:06.208

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.667
The 7th International culinary

01:16:07.708 --> 01:16:09.208
competition.

01:16:09.542 --> 01:16:11.708
Let's give our warmest applauds and shouting

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:14.333
to welcome our final five candidates.

01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:15.625
Let me introduce

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:16.833
those who are now on stage represent

01:16:16.875 --> 01:16:18.583
- the best taste on earth.
- Mayo.

01:16:18.833 --> 01:16:20.250
Money is truly omnipotent,

01:16:20.292 --> 01:16:21.583
otherwise how could she stand on the stage?

01:16:21.708 --> 01:16:23.125
Today, among the final five,

01:16:23.167 --> 01:16:25.167
we will choose the strongest one

01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:27.458
to challenge the two-times champion

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.250
for the throne of the god of cookery.

01:16:32.667 --> 01:16:33.542
Let's not wait any longer,

01:16:33.583 --> 01:16:35.792
our final five candidates are ready.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:36.792
They will have

01:16:36.875 --> 01:16:39.083
100 minutes to make their all-out effort.

01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:40.917
Ladies and Gentleman, are you ready?

01:16:40.958 --> 01:16:42.500
Are we ready?

01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:44.250
Let's begin.

01:16:44.792 --> 01:16:46.125
Competition starts.

01:16:48.333 --> 01:16:50.958
So who should be helping us to appraise?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.833
The judges today are extremely heavyweight.

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.333
The eminent food columnist,

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:57.708
he is also the chairman of our judging panel,

01:16:57.792 --> 01:16:59.875
Mr. Ian Choi.

01:17:00.458 --> 01:17:02.833
Having a very high status in Korean F&B industry,

01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:04.458
also in the drama series "Gourmet",

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.125
she is the cookery consultant, Ms. So-jung Kim.

01:17:07.167 --> 01:17:09.958
Welcome the Director of Culinary Operations of

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.917
Melco Crown Entertainment, Chef Tarn Kwok Fung.

01:17:11.917 --> 01:17:13.583
Mr. Guillaume Galliot

01:17:13.583 --> 01:17:14.750
from France,

01:17:14.917 --> 01:17:17.958
who is the executive chef of the Tasting Room
at City of Dreams.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.458
Thank you very much for coming.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.250
Soy beans.

01:17:21.292 --> 01:17:22.042
Stone mill.

01:17:23.042 --> 01:17:25.000
Are they going to make tofu on-site right now?

01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:27.500
This is not easy.

01:17:32.083 --> 01:17:34.458
Andrew is cooking pigeon tonight, am I right?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
That's right, he is frying and color with butter,

01:17:38.042 --> 01:17:41.083
to keep it crispness outside and tender inside.

01:17:41.167 --> 01:17:44.083
All the vegetables they choose root vegetables.

01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:46.792
And cooks separately
to keep the original taste of it.

01:17:46.833 --> 01:17:48.000
Ms Kim, can you tell us

01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:50.792
what is so special about Mr. Hurosawa sushi?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.417
This Japanese candidate, he is very special.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.208
He uses ink fish and squid

01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:59.083
rather than the expensive Toro.

01:17:59.125 --> 01:18:00.875
I am very much looking forward to taste his dish.

01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:04.750
Chef Tarn,

01:18:04.792 --> 01:18:07.083
What are the two Indian chefs are cooking?

01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:08.833
I think they are cooking

01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:10.292
five-colored Indian curry.

01:18:10.458 --> 01:18:11.792
The five colors stand for

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:13.333
five ingredients from different places.

01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:14.583
It already looks very attractive.

01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:16.083
Very good smell,
I am waiting with my empty stomach.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.500
Empty stomach? It's all not for you.

01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:22.250
This is marinated bean curd.

01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:24.667
Mr.ChoL

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:27.625
These two young chefs are cooperating and

01:18:27.667 --> 01:18:28.750
what kind of dish do you think they are cooking?

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:30.667
Probably is Mapo Tofu.

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:32.458
This is a very ordinary dish.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.875
How are they going to make it tasty yet

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:36.042
innovative at the same time?

01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:37.292
It's not easy.

01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:39.000
Mr. Galliot, can you tell us

01:18:39.042 --> 01:18:40.875
what is Mayo cooking over there?

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:44.167
Oyster is very common in western cuisines.

01:18:44.208 --> 01:18:46.542
But she is actually extracts the water from

01:18:46.583 --> 01:18:48.292
three different oysters, then use

01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:50.833
the molecular techique, to create very new taste,

01:18:50.875 --> 01:18:52.042
which is very unique.

01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:54.458
Let me remind the five candidates,

01:18:54.708 --> 01:18:57.083
It's now the last 30 seconds for food-plating.

01:18:57.417 --> 01:18:58.417
Please make the good use of it.

01:19:00.208 --> 01:19:02.458
Last 3O seconds count down.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.792
Please make good use of its time
to plat your dishes.

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:14.958
All together,

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:16.250
Three.

01:19:16.292 --> 01:19:17.292
Two.

01:19:17.375 --> 01:19:18.208
One.

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:19.458
Time's up.

01:19:19.667 --> 01:19:21.750
Time's up, hand off the plates.

01:19:22.833 --> 01:19:24.250
- Fabulous.
- Good.

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:27.292
Okay, we now invite our judges to taste the food.

01:19:34.125 --> 01:19:34.958
Huan Chen,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.833
who do you think will have the smile until the end?

01:19:37.292 --> 01:19:38.333
Good question.

01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:40.083
But this is definitely a tough question to answer.

01:19:40.125 --> 01:19:42.250
Take a look of our four judges,

01:19:42.292 --> 01:19:43.583
they should be having a headache.

01:19:43.625 --> 01:19:45.792
It's normal,
because my head is aching too right now.

01:19:45.917 --> 01:19:47.125
Who is going to win?

01:19:50.292 --> 01:19:53.375
Today, all the best chefs in the world are here,

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.500
we can definitely call it a culinary summit.

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:57.417
The fights between the best chefs.

01:19:57.625 --> 01:19:58.875
I have the result in my hand.

01:19:59.333 --> 01:20:00.417
Beier, are you nervous?

01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:01.458
Of course I am nervous.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:02.500
Because the winning team,

01:20:02.542 --> 01:20:04.333
will be challenging the god of cookery
a few days later.

01:20:04.583 --> 01:20:05.750
Then please announce the result
as soon as possible.

01:20:06.667 --> 01:20:07.792
So, I am going to announce the result.

01:20:09.208 --> 01:20:11.083
After the deliberation of the judging panel,

01:20:11.208 --> 01:20:12.167
they finally decide,

01:20:12.208 --> 01:20:13.458
the winner is...

01:20:13.667 --> 01:20:15.792
- Paul Ahn...
- Sky K0.

01:20:15.833 --> 01:20:19.125
- Sky...
- Paul Ahn...

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:20.500
Ladies and Gentleman,

01:20:20.542 --> 01:20:22.250
the winner of the final five of

01:20:22.292 --> 01:20:25.083
the World's Supreme Chef Challenge is...

01:20:25.958 --> 01:20:27.833
Sky K0 and Paul Ahn.

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:30.208
Congratulations to Sky K0 and Paul Ahn.

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:32.083
Congratulations.

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:41.333
Now, Mr. Ian Choi please do

01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:43.917
tell us the reasons why they win.

01:20:44.042 --> 01:20:45.000
It's not easy.

01:20:45.042 --> 01:20:47.417
Stuffing the chili bean paste into tofu,

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:49.875
it likes the color of the red marbling.

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:52.292
Using the beef paste to make a big round ball

01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:55.333
and having the juice inside
stayed on top of the tofu.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:58.750
And the tinier ginger juice,
the green onion balls.

01:20:59.083 --> 01:21:02.292
It feels like all the tastes
are exploding from your mouth.

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:03.250
And the most important thing is

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:04.542
they don't forget the origin.

01:21:05.042 --> 01:21:06.292
Everyone knows

01:21:06.417 --> 01:21:08.583
Sichuan cuisine is not only about spicy,

01:21:08.625 --> 01:21:10.042
most importantly is the numbness.

01:21:10.417 --> 01:21:11.625
The Chinese prickly ash that they used,

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:13.333
I knew it when I ate it,

01:21:13.625 --> 01:21:16.458
it is Sichuan pepper.

01:21:16.833 --> 01:21:17.833
A string of pepper,

01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:19.750
you only take the very top three pieces.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:21.750
It smells good and piquant.

01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:23.500
The food that with this ingredient,

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:25.375
the combination of the whole dish

01:21:25.542 --> 01:21:27.833
is really tasty, it is truly delicious.

01:21:27.875 --> 01:21:29.375
What they did

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.667
is genuinely a miracle in the industry.

01:21:45.917 --> 01:21:46.750
A few days later,

01:21:46.792 --> 01:21:48.083
the competition will be held here.

01:21:50.042 --> 01:21:51.083
I have waited for so long

01:21:51.708 --> 01:21:52.583
and finally I am here.

01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:53.667
It's pretty spectacular.

01:21:55.708 --> 01:21:57.125
But do we need to consider

01:21:58.167 --> 01:21:59.208
what we should cook in the next round?

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:02.542
The rule is

01:22:03.958 --> 01:22:06.583
only one person

01:22:06.792 --> 01:22:07.792
can compete against
the god of cookery on the stage.

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:10.958
So you think about it.

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:12.125
Let me help you.

01:22:14.417 --> 01:22:15.542
It is you to think about it.

01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:17.333
I decide to quit.

01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:19.167
It is you

01:22:19.917 --> 01:22:20.917
to challenge the god of cookery.

01:22:22.542 --> 01:22:23.750
After I lost my sense of taste,

01:22:24.292 --> 01:22:26.625
and I still could stand on the stage
in the competition,

01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:29.083
I felt like I have already won.

01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:33.125
So you don't have to make concessions to me.

01:22:33.625 --> 01:22:34.583
I know,

01:22:34.625 --> 01:22:35.708
defeating that person

01:22:36.458 --> 01:22:37.667
is very important to you.

01:22:46.083 --> 01:22:47.083
Thank you.

01:23:06.792 --> 01:23:08.750
But I have ruined the reputation of Seven,

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:10.500
and made that person look down on me.

01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:13.000
If you don't get rid of this,

01:23:13.667 --> 01:23:15.792
you will never get out of your father's shadow.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.958
Welcome to the Studio City Event Center.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.458
We are now in the final stage of

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.458
the World Supreme Chef Challenge.

01:23:26.667 --> 01:23:27.458
Welcome everyone.

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.333
- Please also applaud for our four judges.
- Welcome.

01:23:30.375 --> 01:23:33.333
- Break a leg.
- Sky...

01:23:36.125 --> 01:23:38.208
The long-expected picture has shown up.

01:23:38.333 --> 01:23:40.583
Sky K0, the talented chef from Spring Avenue,

01:23:40.792 --> 01:23:43.250
can he successfully defeat the 2-time champion?

01:23:44.208 --> 01:23:46.667
Please show your strongest enthusiasm

01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:48.292
to welcome the god of cookery,

01:23:48.542 --> 01:23:50.667
Mountain K0.

01:23:52.167 --> 01:24:07.000
The god of cookery...

01:24:16.208 --> 01:24:17.583
I believe that there is no more dishes
on the earth

01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:19.833
that you two cannot handle.

01:24:20.042 --> 01:24:21.375
That's why our judges today

01:24:21.417 --> 01:24:22.583
assigned a very special topic.

01:24:23.042 --> 01:24:25.083
The dish that you two are going to cook,

01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:25.917
has to combine

01:24:25.958 --> 01:24:28.042
your deepest understanding of culinary.

01:24:28.958 --> 01:24:29.958
No matter the taste,

01:24:30.042 --> 01:24:30.958
or the styles,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
it's totally up to you.

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:33.958
The only limited thing is

01:24:34.333 --> 01:24:35.875
you will only have an hour.

01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:38.042
Please get ready.

01:24:38.458 --> 01:24:39.458
And now I announce

01:24:39.542 --> 01:24:41.500
the competition starts.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:49.625
Mr. Ian Choi, may I ask that

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.042
what dish do you think Mountain K0

01:24:51.083 --> 01:24:52.333
will make today?

01:24:52.667 --> 01:24:54.458
His characteristic is keep innovating.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.917
He will not repeat making

01:24:56.083 --> 01:24:57.333
the dish that he made last year.

01:24:57.375 --> 01:24:58.375
I am also very looking forward

01:24:58.417 --> 01:25:00.042
to what he is going to cook.

01:25:01.583 --> 01:25:02.708
In this case,

01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:03.667
today's race definitely will

01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:05.625
showcase the master-level of bringing the color,

01:25:05.708 --> 01:25:07.083
aroma and taste into full play.

01:25:07.667 --> 01:25:09.583
Why the challenger, Sky K0, doesn't move?

01:25:09.833 --> 01:25:10.833
What is he thinking?

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:13.667
- What is he doing?
- He is stiff during the competition,

01:25:14.125 --> 01:25:15.333
and doesn't know what to do?

01:25:49.292 --> 01:25:50.167
What's wrong with you?

01:25:50.208 --> 01:25:51.208
Are you day-dreaming?

01:25:51.458 --> 01:25:52.917
Show me what you got.

01:26:41.083 --> 01:26:43.125
We now enter the last few seconds.

01:26:43.625 --> 01:26:44.458
Five.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:45.458
Four.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.250
Three.

01:26:46.333 --> 01:26:47.375
Two.

01:26:47.417 --> 01:26:48.167
One.

01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:50.375
Time's up...

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:54.750
Miss Etiquette please kindly bring

01:26:54.792 --> 01:26:56.708
Mr. Mountain Ko's dish

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:57.917
to the judges' table.

01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:05.167
Not only the dish has the sweet flavor of sugar,

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:07.833
but also the taste of cherry and licorice.

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:13.500
What a beautiful riverside flower.

01:27:15.167 --> 01:27:17.750
There is a penetrating coolness of mint

01:27:17.792 --> 01:27:19.500
after putting in mouth.

01:27:19.542 --> 01:27:21.000
After tasting it slowly,

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.125
you can feel there is a delicate scent of lily.

01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:25.042
It is amazing.

01:27:25.333 --> 01:27:28.167
Now, Miss Etiquette please bring Sky Ko's...

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:35.708
What do you want to do now?

01:28:50.583 --> 01:28:51.625
To make fine food,

01:28:52.417 --> 01:28:53.375
besides using your tongue,

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.833
you still have to use your eyes, nose and heart.

01:29:01.583 --> 01:29:02.583
Sky.

01:29:09.042 --> 01:29:10.458
You cannot even cut a green onion.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.542
You have no talent.

01:29:12.542 --> 01:29:14.750
Don't you tell people that you are my son.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.542
Well done.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.125
The highest status of being a chef is

01:30:11.167 --> 01:30:12.625
having people tasted

01:30:12.667 --> 01:30:15.625
the flavors of bliss

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:19.000
from the tongue to the heart.

01:30:30.667 --> 01:30:31.667
Come.

01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:33.208
Let's have dinner.

01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:36.042
Let's have dinner.

01:30:42.542 --> 01:30:43.542
Feel free to eat.

01:30:44.917 --> 01:30:46.292
Bon Appetit.

01:30:48.083 --> 01:30:49.417
Here the dish.

01:30:49.458 --> 01:30:51.083
A good new year...

01:30:51.125 --> 01:30:52.417
Happy New Year...

01:30:55.208 --> 01:30:56.500
Good, enjoy.

01:30:56.542 --> 01:30:57.750
It's amazing.

01:30:59.792 --> 01:31:01.542
Master, everyone is here.

01:31:01.583 --> 01:31:02.750
Do you need to say something?

01:31:02.792 --> 01:31:03.833
Okay.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:05.375
Let me say something.

01:31:06.542 --> 01:31:07.583
Hello neighbors,

01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:09.750
Seven has opened till now,

01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:11.708
it has been already 3O years.

01:31:14.417 --> 01:31:15.417
3O years.

01:31:16.792 --> 01:31:17.833
It's not easy.

01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:21.625
Thank you for your support,

01:31:22.083 --> 01:31:23.583
There is a saying,

01:31:24.042 --> 01:31:26.625
there is nothing on earth harder
than having satiety,

01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:30.042
there is nothing on earth better than Sédhana.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:31.458
We, Seven,

01:31:31.958 --> 01:31:34.458
is determined to provide affordable meal.

01:31:35.292 --> 01:31:35.958
Cheers!

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.125
- Good...
- Cheers!

01:31:39.333 --> 01:31:42.625
Cheers...

01:31:44.917 --> 01:31:45.917
Rice ball.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.208
Go.

01:31:55.458 --> 01:31:57.375
Qkay...

01:32:04.833 --> 01:32:06.917
We wish all of you

01:32:08.958 --> 01:32:12.875
A Happy Year of the Rooster!

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:20.167
