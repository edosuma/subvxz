00:43.927 --> 00:47.512
<i> Are we going to allow the</i>
<i> system to perpetuate a lie,</i>

00:47.515 --> 00:49.482
<i> or are we going</i>
<i> to get educated--</i>

00:49.483 --> 00:51.450
<i> - Trayvon Martin case and all</i>
<i> these big high-profile cases--</i>

00:51.451 --> 00:53.418
<i> - And you believe the jails</i>

00:53.421 --> 00:55.176

00:55.177 --> 00:56.932

<i> Brian Sudermill.</i>

<i> - So where do we stand when it</i>
<i> comes to privilege in America?</i>

01:02.340 --> 01:04.163
<i> - We are so marginalized</i>
<i> as a people.</i>

01:04.165 --> 01:05.921
<i> - There are people dying in</i>
<i> my neighborhood every day.</i>

01:05.922 --> 01:07.678
<i> - Find your place of truth.</i>

01:07.679 --> 01:09.435
<i> - ...criminalized, they are</i>
<i> sometimes victimized,</i>

01:09.437 --> 01:12.338
<i> almost in--</i>

01:12.339 --> 01:15.240
<i> - Other minorities do not get</i>
<i> the news coverage.</i>

01:15.242 --> 01:16.742
- I want to open the phones.
Let's talk this out.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.111
I'm calling for comp.

- 107.5 WGCI, you are live
with Kendra G.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.348
- Call us right now,
866-9-RICKEY,

01:23.350 --> 01:25.851
866-9-RICKEY,
"Rickey Smiley Morning Show."

01:25.853 --> 01:27.586
- What's up? It's Angela Yee,

01:27.588 --> 01:30.055
and we are back
on "The Breakfast Club."

01:30.056 --> 01:32.523
- So what is it we're really
talking about, race, prejudice?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.501
- The fact that we're talking
about race

01:34.502 --> 01:36.477
is indicative of the prejudice
by inheritance.

01:36.478 --> 01:38.453
<i> - The prison system is really</i>

01:38.454 --> 01:40.429
one of the biggest businesses
in America today.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.334
- All right,
black lives matter, yes.

01:42.336 --> 01:45.104
Latino lives matter too.
Asian lives matter.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.106
<i> Indian lives matter.</i>
<i> Muslim lives matter.</i>

01:47.108 --> 01:49.241
- So everything's got to be
about race all the time

01:49.243 --> 01:50.509
'cause it sells the news.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.111
It sells
to the community leaders.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.113
- Stereotypes are real.
- Yeah, they are.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.514
- For a reason.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.082
- They're not made up out
of thin air.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.649
- Everyone, of course,
has strong opinions

01:58.652 --> 02:00.385
on one side or the other,

02:00.387 --> 02:03.272
but if we're gonna really
grow as a community,

02:03.273 --> 02:06.158
<i> as a society, we need to start</i>
<i> listening to all perspectives.</i>

02:06.160 --> 02:08.193
- You want to go downtown...
[inaudible]

02:08.195 --> 02:09.595
- Compared to a Caucasian
person,

02:09.597 --> 02:11.130
you always have to prove
if you're there.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.664
They never want
to believe you on face value.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.489

02:14.490 --> 02:16.313
<i> - Oh, you supposed</i>
<i> to be innocent</i>

02:16.314 --> 02:18.137
until you're proven guilty, but
apparently that ain't the case.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.705
- We can't just talk
about race. We can't just

02:19.706 --> 02:21.272
talk about prejudice.
- Well, you have the story

02:21.273 --> 02:22.839
that the mainstream media's
gonna say anyway.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.406
- And I think the cops have
a right to be suspicious.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.111
<i> I get it. I get it.</i>

02:26.112 --> 02:27.812
- Attorney Jackie Styles.
I'm his attorney.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.848
- Murderer!
- I don't trust them.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.151
I ain't pulling over for no cop
unless there's witnesses.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.886
- We have another opportunity
to hype up

02:33.888 --> 02:36.688
a black and white dispute and
make the black kid look bad.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.624
- Whether you're black
or white,

02:38.626 --> 02:41.426
whether you're Christian
or Muslim,

02:41.428 --> 02:44.630
we are all one big family.

02:44.631 --> 02:47.833

Confident but not cocky,

04:26.734 --> 04:29.668
I like that,
but my question to you is,

04:29.670 --> 04:33.939
does Jackie Styles
know when to get mean?

04:34.541 --> 04:38.543
- If by mean you mean tough,

04:52.326 --> 04:56.595
Okay, well, then I guess we'll
just have to settle on 100.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.365
- 120 plus 50 it is.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.535

05:07.074 --> 05:08.974
For seven years
I've served the county

05:08.976 --> 05:10.942
as an assistant
state's attorney.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.078
I've put countless
criminals behind bars

05:13.080 --> 05:14.980
and helped clean up
our streets,

05:14.982 --> 05:17.716
but now I need your help
with my next challenge:

05:17.718 --> 05:19.618
cleaning up the mayor's office.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.054
It's time to set
those old politics aside

05:22.056 --> 05:25.324
and give this city
the fresh start it deserves.

05:25.326 --> 05:28.593

Thank you.

Wrap for lunch.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.732
- So? Talk to me.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.400
- A little antiquated,
don't you think?

05:35.402 --> 05:37.869
- No, no, no, simple and
to the point, no flash.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.638
We just run it a million times.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.557
People will see
that I'm genuine.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.475
- Sure, works for me.
If you have a moment,

05:43.477 --> 05:46.044
Mr. Abernathy from the
city council is holding on two.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.480
- Not a problem,
but do me a favor.

05:48.482 --> 05:51.750
Transfer that call to my cell.
It's about that time.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.353
Got to get my first-time
Barack on.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.955

Now, what's fascinating
about genetics is what...

06:03.063 --> 06:05.664
- Yo, you need us
to help you out tonight?

06:05.666 --> 06:07.099
- Nah, man, it's straight.

06:07.101 --> 06:09.000
I'm pretty much done
with all the boxes.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.002
We ain't got as much
as he is anyway.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.039
- Good, 'cause I wasn't trying
to help you out anyway.

you just don't stay here, bro.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.538
this community has definitely
benefitted from you.

to tear it down.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.675
May as well just
build it right back up.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.544
- Obviously that is very true,

06:52.546 --> 06:54.546
but we sure got much more
to do though.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.114
Now, when you coming
back to church?

06:56.116 --> 06:58.450

21:12.472 --> 21:15.806
- Hey, look at me.
Your life matters to me.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.408
- Stop touching me.
You just can't--

21:17.409 --> 21:19.009
- This is a night of love.
- Listen, no it ain't.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.479
- Shh. Let's bury the hatchet.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.981
- You don't go to school with
any of these other kids, right?

21:23.983 --> 21:26.267
- No way.
- All right.

21:26.268 --> 21:28.552
- Graduated in 2010, but I used
to sit for Zoey

21:28.554 --> 21:30.354
and a few of these other kids
back in high school.

21:30.356 --> 21:32.290
- Okay, all right,
well, you know,

21:32.292 --> 21:33.891
I'm with one of my boys.
He go to that school now.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.360
- You're, like,
the surrogate big brother?

21:36.362 --> 21:37.795
- Yeah, yeah.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.430
Well, you know,
you took care of the drinks,

21:39.431 --> 21:41.064
so I guess that makes
you the big sister.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.217
- I guess so.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.368
- Let's come together
and end this darkness.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.971
- Get--

21:47.840 --> 21:49.006
- Whoa, your hair.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.908
- Have a drink with me?

21:50.909 --> 21:52.809
- That was part
of my plan all along.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.079
Little Punky
Brewster can get it, now.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.781
Come on, now,
[inaudible].

21:56.783 --> 21:59.583
- You want to know a deep,
dark secret?

22:01.321 --> 22:03.454
I learned on the accordion.
- [scoffs]

22:03.456 --> 22:05.423
- Shut up.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.857
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.493
Oh, my dad,
he had this bachata group,

22:09.495 --> 22:12.663
<i> and sometimes they'd switch</i>
<i> it up for the rhythm guitar.</i>

22:12.665 --> 22:14.598
You want to know
another secret?

22:16.869 --> 22:23.541
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

22:23.543 --> 22:26.844
- I already knew that secret.
- Oh, really?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.546
Am I that transparent?

22:28.548 --> 22:31.048
- Yeah, you're a little light.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.750
- Shut up.

22:32.752 --> 22:38.889
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

22:38.891 --> 22:43.461
- Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy.
I think your girl left.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.765
- What time is it?
- The party's over.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.333
- I'll drive home.
- You--you ain't driving.

22:49.334 --> 22:50.900
No, I got you. We got you.
We're coming in peace.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.236
- I'm good.

22:52.237 --> 22:53.570
I'm good. I can drive.
- Whoa.

22:53.573 --> 22:54.739
- I'm good to drive, bro.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.608
- Come on.
- Thanks, bro.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.476
- Your breath
is super offensive, okay?

23:00.079 --> 23:02.513
Hey, look, look.
MayMay!

23:02.515 --> 23:04.382
- MayMay!
- MayMay!

23:04.384 --> 23:04.882
- MayMay!

23:09.922 --> 23:13.391
Why is it black people
always drive these big SUVs?

23:13.393 --> 23:15.760
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. I'ma let you slide

23:15.762 --> 23:18.246
'cause you drunk.

23:18.247 --> 23:20.731
- You know, my BMW connects
straight to your phone,

23:20.733 --> 23:22.933
Bluetooth and everything.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.403
- Some are just born lucky.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.405
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, look.

23:27.407 --> 23:31.008
My dad didn't become rich
because of his generosity,

23:31.010 --> 23:33.544
but it wasn't given
to him either.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.880
I can't tell you how many kids

23:35.882 --> 23:39.049
I know just get cars
for their birthday.

23:39.051 --> 23:42.887
Happy 16th, son.
You failed three classes?

23:42.889 --> 23:45.689
You get an Audi
instead of a Lexus.

23:45.691 --> 23:48.125
No, we went 50/50.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.562
I earned $15,000
working the golf courses.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.497
It took me three years.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.835
You think all of us
got something for nothing.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.205
- You do know where I come
from people have real problems?

24:01.207 --> 24:03.841
- Can't help being born
where you're born, man.

24:03.843 --> 24:06.143
- Says the wealthy kid
with the BMW.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.546
- Do you not see
what you're in right now?

24:08.548 --> 24:10.848
You keep talking like
you don't live here,

24:10.850 --> 24:12.082
like you're just visiting.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.984
What have you got
to prove, man?

24:13.986 --> 24:16.554
Where is the shame in coming
from a nice neighborhood?

24:16.556 --> 24:18.155
My parents worked hard
to get to where they are,

24:18.157 --> 24:20.224
and from the looks of it,
so have yours.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.226
- I don't feel like
I'm welcome here.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.894
- That's all in your head!
Who is it telling you to leave?

24:23.896 --> 24:26.831
- Nobody!
- When I was seven years old,

24:26.833 --> 24:30.000
I remember my parents took me
out to the mall downtown.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.803
I was standing there
holding my mom's hand,

24:32.805 --> 24:35.573
and I saw another kid
there holding his mom's hand,

24:35.575 --> 24:39.543
only I had never seen anyone
like him except maybe on TV,

24:39.545 --> 24:43.013
so at seven years old,
I was unfamiliar with him, man.

24:44.250 --> 24:48.519
But I am asking you,
is that my fault?

24:49.489 --> 24:52.056
- You're not seven
no more, Brian.

25:00.766 --> 25:02.967
- Thanks for the ride.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.669
My house is up here
on the left.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.050
[loud pop]

25:22.188 --> 25:24.922
- What was that?
- I don't know.

25:25.258 --> 25:28.926
- Probably somebody blew a tire
on that pothole again.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.295
- I guess.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.933
- Where are you going?

25:35.935 --> 25:38.035
- I'm gonna check it out.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.540
<i> [tense music]</i>

25:42.542 --> 25:46.210
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

25:46.212 --> 25:48.579
- Help!

25:48.581 --> 25:55.753
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

26:01.227 --> 26:06.564
- Somebody help! Help! Help!

26:06.566 --> 26:12.336
- [echoing] Brian? Oh, my God.
Brian! Brian!

26:12.338 --> 26:14.972
- When you dropped him off
at his parents' house,

26:14.974 --> 26:18.075
that was around 4:30.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.843
And then you just left.
Is that right?

26:19.845 --> 26:21.946
- I drove out. I pulled up,

26:21.947 --> 26:24.048
and I see someone laying
on the floor, and I ran over.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.250
I shook him.
That's why my hands got bloody.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.319
- So you kill kids and you
sell drugs, right, Lashawn?

26:28.321 --> 26:30.020
- You know what?

26:30.022 --> 26:31.489
You put that in my mouth.
I didn't say that.

26:31.490 --> 26:32.957
You said that.
Why would you put that on me?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.725
- Marcus, Marcus,

26:34.727 --> 26:37.595
tell me what happened
so we can all go home.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.597
Come on, man, I know you're
just protecting your friends,

26:39.599 --> 26:43.367
but it's not gonna work
because your boys right now,

26:43.369 --> 26:44.935
my two partners
got them in a room.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.537
One of them's already talking.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.138
<i> I wouldn't be surprised</i>
<i> if he was telling all the</i>

26:48.140 --> 26:49.740
cheat against you
right now.

26:49.742 --> 26:52.242
- That's a lie.
He wouldn't do that.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.178
- You don't sound too sure
about that.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.780
- They don't care about
what I got to say, Dad.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.382
In they mind I did it.

26:58.384 --> 27:01.085
In y'all mind I'm a murderer.
In y'all mind--

27:01.087 --> 27:03.053
[knock at door]

27:03.055 --> 27:05.005
- Bam.

27:05.006 --> 27:06.956
- Oh, and now
we have a warrant,

27:06.959 --> 27:09.093
which entitles us
to search your premises.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.028
- Any idea what we should
expect to find

27:11.030 --> 27:12.896
when we tour
that house up there?

27:12.898 --> 27:14.765
- I don't know, man.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.700
Now can I talk to my lawyer?
I'm tired of talking to y'all.

27:16.702 --> 27:19.687
- You know what that is?
- Oh, yeah.

27:19.688 --> 27:22.673
- No, take a really good look.
- Look like <i> cocaina </i> to me.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.274
Whatever, it's not mine,
so what's up?

27:24.276 --> 27:25.776
- I have a report saying
that you two were in

27:25.778 --> 27:26.944
a fight not too long ago.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.323
- It wasn't a fight.

27:28.324 --> 27:29.701
It was a heated basketball
competition.

27:29.702 --> 27:31.079
- What were you fighting about?

27:31.083 --> 27:32.950
- Are you even trying to listen
to him?

27:32.952 --> 27:34.918
- We got past that.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.822
- I can do something for you
if you give me something.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.279
- You can go fetch me
some weed.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.264
- Yo, I want to talk
to my lawyer though.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.400
How about that?
What?

27:49.402 --> 27:51.201
- [inaudible].
- Get your hands off me!

27:51.203 --> 27:52.653
Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me, man.

27:52.654 --> 27:54.104
- Sit down!
- You want to do something?

27:54.106 --> 27:55.739
Come on!

27:55.741 --> 27:57.207
- How about I lock you up
and lose the key?

27:57.209 --> 27:58.575
How would you like that?
I got this.

27:58.576 --> 27:59.942
- Cool it.
- I got this.

27:59.943 --> 28:01.309
- Cool it.
- I got this!

28:01.313 --> 28:03.080
And they'll find you
in a frigging Dumpster!

28:03.082 --> 28:04.632
- Listen, you don't want to
[inaudible]

28:04.633 --> 28:06.183
again, not on a piece
of trash like this.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.701
- It's not gonna be like
the other one.

28:07.702 --> 28:09.218
- Remember the last guy?
- I--

28:09.221 --> 28:11.789
- Who pulled the trigger?!
Who pulled the trigger?

28:12.692 --> 28:15.292
- Your mama,
that's who pulled the trigger.

28:19.932 --> 28:23.267
<i> - Power 92.3,</i>
<i> Terrence Palmer here.</i>

28:23.269 --> 28:26.403
Like everyone, I am talking
about Brian Sudermill,

28:26.405 --> 28:29.840
the boy from the 'burbs killed
in front of his own house.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.475
- Mr. Kholi Styles,

28:31.476 --> 28:33.109
you're being charged
with murder in the first degree

28:33.112 --> 28:35.112
in the death
of Mr. Brian Sudermill.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.246
Do you understand?

28:36.248 --> 28:37.981
- Yes, sir.

28:37.983 --> 28:40.217
- And how do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.853
- A murder happens every day
here in Chicago.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.321
When it happens
outside of the city,

28:44.323 --> 28:45.856
that's when it makes
national news.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.157
"The Chicago Tribune,"

28:47.159 --> 28:49.026
"The Chicago Sun Times,"
"RedEye,"

28:49.028 --> 28:52.362
all have devoted front page
coverage above the fold.

28:52.364 --> 28:55.399
- There's a lot of unconscious
bias that goes on.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.334
It happens with all of us.
It's very natural

28:57.336 --> 29:00.137
because your perspective
is based on your environment

29:00.139 --> 29:01.305
and what you've experienced.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.240
- ASA Canton?
- Yes?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.192
- Now, you've succeeded
in getting life sentences

29:05.193 --> 29:07.143
your last three murder trials.
Will you seek life again?

29:07.146 --> 29:08.412
- Now, Jake, you know
I'm not prepared

29:08.414 --> 29:09.847
to discuss that at this time.

29:09.848 --> 29:11.281
- Do you believe that
your being a black man

29:11.283 --> 29:12.750
in this particular case

29:12.752 --> 29:14.318
puts you
in an awkward position?

29:14.320 --> 29:16.887
- Look, I'm not the first black
prosecutor

29:16.889 --> 29:19.857
to try a black defendant,
and I won't be the last.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.793
- Every murdered child
deserves front-page coverage.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.762
- Like, I just saw a video
recently in the news

29:24.764 --> 29:27.097
where people
literally saw a kid dying

29:27.099 --> 29:29.533
and were, like, walking away
because they were scared.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.502
- So was it a hate crime?
Was he killed

29:31.504 --> 29:33.771
because he was white?
- Mr. Styles,

29:33.773 --> 29:35.539
given that this is
the first charge against you,

29:35.541 --> 29:37.474
I'm gonna set bail
at $3 million.

29:38.077 --> 29:41.812
- Who did the judge think
his dad is, P Diddy, Jay-Z?

29:41.814 --> 29:44.047
This is not Blue Ivy
that's in jail right now.

29:44.049 --> 29:46.250
- Whether you--you caused

29:46.252 --> 29:48.318
suffering to someone,
it is a mistake.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.187
- Unless you plan to
murder them on purpose.

29:50.189 --> 29:51.822
Then it's not a mistake.

29:51.823 --> 29:53.456
- With Kholi being accused
of murder,

29:53.459 --> 29:55.125
we have to look at it

29:55.127 --> 29:57.027
from a--from
a Christian perspective.

29:57.029 --> 30:00.063
We have to look at it
through those Christ lens.

30:00.065 --> 30:02.366
- Your Honor, I believe
1 or even 2 million

30:02.368 --> 30:04.201
would be sufficient.
Even those figures

30:04.203 --> 30:06.203
would be near impossible
for my client to obtain,

30:06.205 --> 30:08.071
but 3 million is nowhere
within his reach.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.407
- Black man to black man,
I would be sympathetic,

30:10.409 --> 30:13.076
except I chose to make
something of myself,

30:13.078 --> 30:14.812
while he chose
a different path,

30:14.814 --> 30:17.281
so no,
I'm not in an awkward position.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.316
He and I,
in more ways than one,

30:19.318 --> 30:21.385
are on completely
opposite sides,

30:21.387 --> 30:24.254
and my team and I are going to
make sure that this city

30:24.256 --> 30:26.990
and the jury
see that as clear as day.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.959
- See, the lamestream media
wants to keep the narrative

30:28.961 --> 30:31.094
going of black versus white,
black versus white

30:31.096 --> 30:33.564
'cause that's how a lot
of these guys make money.

30:33.566 --> 30:36.033
<i> The news media, some of</i>
<i> the community organizers,</i>

30:36.035 --> 30:38.435
<i> they got to keep black</i>
<i> and white people fighting</i>

30:38.437 --> 30:40.003
<i> 'cause it's a good story,</i>

30:40.005 --> 30:42.005
and when we realize
they're sitting

30:42.007 --> 30:43.507
at the big table getting rich
and we're down here fighting

30:43.509 --> 30:45.475
and killing
each other over nonsense.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.878
- It's a never-ending struggle
for all minorities,

30:47.880 --> 30:50.214
but for some reason
it's forgotten

30:50.216 --> 30:53.450
that the fact it's not just
black injustice in America.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.320
- Mr. Franklin, you're no
stranger to cases like this.

30:56.322 --> 30:57.988
Some might even say that
you helped write the book

30:57.990 --> 30:59.990
on putting murderers
like this away.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.391
- Now, that's not
a question, is it?

31:01.393 --> 31:02.993
- Well, but don't you think

31:02.994 --> 31:04.594
that it could send
the wrong message?

31:04.597 --> 31:06.430
- Now, that's a question,
but no, I don't.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.232
- Now, I doubt you would ever
exhibit

31:08.234 --> 31:10.212
such a breach of etiquette

31:10.213 --> 31:12.191
as to ask me
to cut bail in half

31:12.192 --> 31:14.170
were it not for the simple fact
that you're defending your son.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.539
Let this be the only incident.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.075
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Forgive me.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.878
- A.J. Canton didn't ask me
to join this case.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.081
I went after the prosecution
for the sole purpose

31:24.083 --> 31:26.028
<i> of joining that team,</i>

31:26.029 --> 31:27.974
<i> and it just so happens</i>
<i> that the lead prosecutor</i>

31:27.975 --> 31:29.920
is my good friend,
Mr. A.J. Canton.

31:29.922 --> 31:33.957
- Let us remember the family
of Kholi Styles.

31:33.959 --> 31:36.627
Remember, Chicago,
we haven't heard it all yet.

31:36.629 --> 31:39.229
- There'll be
no more questions.

31:40.232 --> 31:44.534
- A $80,000 advance?
That's a lot of cash, Jackie.

31:44.536 --> 31:48.005
- I know, and I feel terrible
even having to ask.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.540
- And you'll be acting
as his attorney?

31:56.382 --> 31:58.482
So what you're telling me
is you want 80 grand,

31:58.484 --> 32:00.417
and you'll be pretty much
unavailable to work for me

32:00.419 --> 32:02.052
for the next several months

32:02.054 --> 32:03.687
after I've only hired you
a few weeks ago.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.389
- Sir, with all due respect,

32:05.391 --> 32:06.957
I can't just leave
my son in there.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.593
- Jackie,
I think you're a good guy,

32:09.595 --> 32:12.062
but I can't forward you
that much money.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.634
However, I'll keep you
on a leave of absence,

32:17.636 --> 32:20.504
and in lieu of pay
I'll arrange additional support

32:20.506 --> 32:22.539
for your team from one
of our younger counsel.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.042
- I--I can't afford that.
- Don't you worry about that.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.294
It's on me.

32:27.295 --> 32:29.545
You just worry about closing
this case and helping your boy.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.315
You take whatever time
you need.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.483
Your job will be waiting
after you win it.

32:34.053 --> 32:37.154
- Thank you, Mr. Shaw.
Thank you.

32:37.589 --> 32:41.258
- I mean, church, the world
doesn't need more religion.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.661
What we need is more love,
and once we love one another

32:44.663 --> 32:46.964
in spite of our differences,

32:46.966 --> 32:49.967
<i> once we love one another</i>
<i> in spite of our flaws,</i>

32:49.969 --> 32:52.269
<i> once we love one another</i>
<i> in spite of our differences,</i>

32:52.271 --> 32:54.504
we lead people to Christ.

32:55.507 --> 32:58.408
- All right, inmates,
we got a new one.

32:58.410 --> 33:02.012
- Ezekiel 22:30 says,

33:02.014 --> 33:05.248
"I looked for someone
among them that would build up

33:05.250 --> 33:09.553
"the wall and stand
before me on behalf of the land

33:09.555 --> 33:11.572
so I would not
have to destroy it."

33:11.573 --> 33:13.590
- Preacher Man, come and meet
your new neighbor.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.526
- "But I found no one."

33:16.528 --> 33:19.129
Church, we need to stop
judging.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.737
<i> I mean, we can't all be saints</i>
<i> in the church. I know I'm not.</i>

33:26.739 --> 33:29.139
I know you guys are saying
some of you guys are innocent,

33:29.141 --> 33:31.274
but I know I'm not.

33:31.276 --> 33:34.011
[laughter]

33:34.013 --> 33:37.681
I mean, I've been on the block.
I probably sold to some of you

33:37.683 --> 33:40.550
<i> when I was coming up</i>
<i> on Stony Island.</i>

33:40.552 --> 33:43.487
You know me.

33:44.123 --> 33:47.691
<i> Look, we all are</i>
<i> and were flat broke</i>

33:47.693 --> 33:51.128
<i> and in need of someone</i>
<i> to pay our debt,</i>

33:51.130 --> 33:53.397
and the only one worthy died
on Calvary.

33:53.399 --> 33:56.500
<i> I mean, greater love</i>
<i> has no more than this,</i>

33:56.502 --> 34:00.070
to lay down one's life
for one's friend.

34:05.611 --> 34:08.478
Look at your neighbor.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.281
Grab their hand.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.618
And let them know,
"I'm with you."

34:14.620 --> 34:16.820
all: I'm with you.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.122
- Let them know,
"I'm with you."

34:19.124 --> 34:20.323
all: I'm with you.

34:20.325 --> 34:21.458
- I am with you!

34:21.460 --> 34:23.593
all: I am with you.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.695
- 'Cause if not you, then who?

34:26.331 --> 34:29.666
Amen. Amen.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.402
- Tensions is rising
all across the world,

34:32.404 --> 34:34.371
and social media is heating up.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.073
- On your news feed you scroll,

34:36.074 --> 34:37.774
and you see the face
accused of the crime,

34:37.776 --> 34:40.343
and right there, that's,
you know, judge and jury.

34:40.345 --> 34:42.412
- Blacks have to work twice

34:42.413 --> 34:44.480
as hard to accomplish
what white people get.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.682
- That's not true.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.451
- In the past few decades,

34:47.452 --> 34:49.219
I mean, thousands of young
Latino men shot

34:49.221 --> 34:51.755
and killed by police officers.
Can you name me one?

34:51.757 --> 34:53.240
- And you think what,

34:53.241 --> 34:54.724
white people just get
everything handed to them?

34:54.726 --> 34:57.043
- I can give you two,

34:57.044 --> 34:59.361
Ricardo Diaz-Zeferino,
Gardena, 2013,

34:59.364 --> 35:03.233
Antonio Zambrano-Montes,

35:03.234 --> 35:07.103
Pasco, Wash, 2015, both killed
by state police officers.

35:07.106 --> 35:08.638
- And those state
police officers,

35:08.640 --> 35:10.640
they went back to work
like nothing happened.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.242
- It's easy to see
why a police officer

35:12.243 --> 35:13.843
would look at Kholi and think,
"Oh, he's a murderer,"

35:13.846 --> 35:15.645
because that was
his mindset anyway.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.714
His mindset was already,
"He's up to no good."

35:17.716 --> 35:19.716
- It's almost like we've become
desensitized,

35:19.718 --> 35:21.485
and this is, like,
the--the norm.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.253
- This is just America now.
- And as you grow up,

35:23.255 --> 35:25.388
you realize the stuff
we used to do as teenagers

35:25.390 --> 35:27.691
and then coming to tell
a daughter that we was

35:27.693 --> 35:30.260
basically being racist
and stereotyping each other.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.395
- You think you have it
harder than me?

35:32.397 --> 35:34.598
- No, I know I do.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.800
<i> - So, can you help me?</i>
<i> I need you to dig around,</i>

35:36.802 --> 35:39.136
see what you can find,
anything.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.205
- My God, Jackie.

35:41.206 --> 35:43.273
I'm sure it crossed your mind
that's a pretty weak alibi.

35:43.275 --> 35:47.677
- Frank, you know Kholi.
- Do I? Do you?

35:47.679 --> 35:51.448
Hey, you're a great dad,
but sometimes, you know,

35:51.450 --> 35:53.183
a kid can slip, you know,

35:53.185 --> 35:54.584
and there's just nothing
you can do.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.386
- Well, I know what I need
to do,

35:56.388 --> 35:58.855
and that's prove
he didn't do this.

35:58.857 --> 36:02.225
Now, my question to you
is will you help me?

36:03.362 --> 36:08.165
- You already know I will,
but where we gonna start?

36:11.436 --> 36:13.370
- Ms. Abbas?

36:14.640 --> 36:17.307
- Mr. Shaw. Is everything okay?

36:17.309 --> 36:18.842
- Are you familiar
with the Kholi Styles,

36:18.844 --> 36:20.710
Brian Sudermill case?

36:20.712 --> 36:23.180
- I am, and I'm sure you know
better than I do

36:23.182 --> 36:25.682
that it's--it's pretty clearly
open and shut.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.567
I mean, don't you think so?

36:27.568 --> 36:29.451
- It doesn't really matter
what I think.

36:29.454 --> 36:31.454
You've just been promoted,
Ms. Abbas.

36:31.456 --> 36:34.658
You'll be taking second chair
for the defense on this trial,

36:34.660 --> 36:37.494
a trial that I need handled
with care.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.913
Mr. Styles
is a great investment,

36:39.914 --> 36:42.331
an investment that we need
to get back to work.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.968
Do you understand?

36:45.504 --> 36:48.305
Good.
Well, you should get going.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.241
You have a lot
to get familiar with.

36:57.482 --> 36:59.616
- I wasn't in bed yet
'cause the baby was screaming.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.985
That's when I heard the bang,
and I thought, I don't know,

37:01.987 --> 37:03.887
maybe an old car somewhere
was having trouble.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.622
Took me a moment
to calm her down,

37:05.623 --> 37:07.356
and I realized
I was still hearing screams.

37:07.359 --> 37:10.460
Peeked out the window and
saw Bill and that black kid.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.929
- Any idea how long from
when you heard the shot

37:12.931 --> 37:14.631
to when you looked
out the window?

37:14.633 --> 37:16.633
- I'm sorry, one minute,
five minutes.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.501
I was focused on my daughter
at the moment.

37:18.503 --> 37:20.270
- How well did you know Brian?

37:20.272 --> 37:22.939
- He used to babysit the boys
a few years ago.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.708
I don't feel like much
of a friend discussing this,

37:24.710 --> 37:27.310
but Brian was a pot head.

37:27.312 --> 37:29.646
Nothing beyond
what kids tend to do--I mean,

37:29.648 --> 37:31.782
I was a now-and-then
smoker myself,

37:31.783 --> 37:33.917
but you become a dad, you get
delivered from all that,

37:33.919 --> 37:35.919
and you don't want your kids
around people

37:35.921 --> 37:37.654
that do the things
you used to do yourself.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.556
- Yeah.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.602
- I need his Webelos uniform.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.437
- I boxed it.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.940
- [sighs]

37:58.343 --> 38:00.477
- Which box?

38:00.479 --> 38:04.814
- Donations.
- I don't want you in here.

38:05.317 --> 38:09.853
I'm keeping everything.
I'm making something for him.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.597
Don't wear that.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.565
- Check the box in the back.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.437

38:48.360 --> 38:50.093

38:52.364 --> 38:54.464
You're a friend
of Kholi Styles?

38:55.467 --> 38:58.101
I'm a detective working
on his case.

38:58.103 --> 39:01.004
- What, WPD?
- Nothing like that, private.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.872
I'm working for Kholi's dad,
family friends.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.741
- Yeah, well, I got
nothing to hide.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.643
- Then, hey, you don't mind
if I ask you some questions?

39:06.645 --> 39:08.712
He was at your party that
night, right, him and Brian?

39:08.714 --> 39:10.697
- Yeah, and everyone else
in town, so.

39:10.698 --> 39:12.681
- Did you have any contact
with him that night?

39:12.684 --> 39:14.451
- Yes, I did,

39:14.453 --> 39:16.553
but he didn't say anything
about killing Brian, so.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.788
- How well do you know Kholi?

39:18.790 --> 39:20.423
- Get to the point.

39:20.425 --> 39:22.492
- Well, I've known Kholi
all his life, right,

39:22.494 --> 39:24.361
and I'd like to prove
that he didn't do this,

39:24.363 --> 39:25.895
and if, like you said,
he didn't mention it to you

39:25.897 --> 39:27.631
or act suspiciously all night,

39:27.632 --> 39:29.366
then you might be somebody
who can help.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.067
- They found him standing over
Brian's body.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.069
Don't that mean he did it?

39:33.071 --> 39:35.105
- Actually, no, it doesn't,
but the cops don't have

39:35.107 --> 39:38.141
any other suspects,
and they aren't looking.

39:38.143 --> 39:41.878
I can see that you care,
that he meant something to you.

39:42.681 --> 39:45.081
We need your help, all right?
I need to get inside this,

39:45.083 --> 39:47.517
and you're the only person
that can do that.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.786
- Yeah?
What do you need me to do?

39:49.788 --> 39:51.921
- Brian's world,
the people in it,

39:51.923 --> 39:54.657
I need to get inside his life.
Can you do that?

39:55.927 --> 39:57.694
- Yeah, I think I can do that.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.714
- Yeah, come on in.
- Thank you.

40:06.715 --> 40:08.693

Nice to meet you, Nancy.
- Yeah, have a seat right here.

40:12.978 --> 40:16.946
Yeah, I think I remember
seeing you in the office there.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.581
How many cases like this
have you worked?

40:18.583 --> 40:20.784
- Um, well, I just passed
the bar last summer,

40:20.786 --> 40:22.786
so, you know,
this'll be one of my first,

40:22.788 --> 40:25.555
but I've helped
in a lot of civil cases.

40:25.557 --> 40:29.959
Here, um, I pulled some files
on similar cases

40:29.961 --> 40:31.661
we can look at.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.731
That is the State of Illinois
versus Elias Braley.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.099
He was an African-American
teenager

40:36.101 --> 40:37.667
who was caught on
a parking lot camera

40:37.669 --> 40:39.436
shooting a white teenager.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.471
They got a reduced sentence
of ten years after proving

40:41.473 --> 40:43.140
he was attacked first.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.808
- Look, my son doesn't belong
in there another ten minutes,

40:44.810 --> 40:45.942
let alone ten years.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.894
- I think it's only fair

40:47.895 --> 40:49.845
that I put this out there
right from the start, okay?

40:49.848 --> 40:52.682
I've reviewed the facts
of Kholi's case,

40:52.683 --> 40:55.517
and I am not entirely convinced
that your son is innocent.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.587
Now, I'm gonna do
whatever I can to help,

40:57.589 --> 40:59.189
but I think the best line
of pursuit

40:59.191 --> 41:01.024
may be to admit
that he shot the boy first

41:01.026 --> 41:02.826
while showing
how the earlier altercation

41:02.828 --> 41:05.662
provoked Brian
into attacking him.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.647
The toxicology test proved

41:07.648 --> 41:09.631
that they'd both been
drinking that night.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.353
- It's an option, Jackie.

41:13.354 --> 41:14.570
We've been racking our brains
here and come up with nothing.

41:14.573 --> 41:17.106
- That still doesn't explain
how Kholi got a gun.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.741
Kholi doesn't own a gun.

41:18.743 --> 41:20.098
- How can you be so sure?
You know,

41:20.099 --> 41:21.454
maybe one of the other
two boys he was with--

41:21.455 --> 41:22.810
- Because he's my son.

41:22.814 --> 41:26.082
I know my son,
and he wouldn't do this.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.252
I know it. I believe it.

41:29.254 --> 41:31.221
- This is something.
My kids are upset.

41:31.223 --> 41:33.256
My wife is afraid, and we've
never been afraid before.

41:33.258 --> 41:35.091
It is a little too close
to home, this story.

41:35.093 --> 41:36.893
- I actually admire the guy
for sticking around,

41:36.895 --> 41:38.578
even if he did it,

41:38.579 --> 41:40.262
and calling for help
because what are the cops

41:40.265 --> 41:42.165
gonna think the first time
they roll up and they see--

41:42.167 --> 41:44.000
- You admire him?
- But what's the first thing

41:44.002 --> 41:45.752
they're gonna see
when they see a black kid

41:45.753 --> 41:47.503
hunched over a seemingly
dead body covered in blood?

41:47.506 --> 41:48.771
- I'm surprised
they didn't shoot him.

41:48.773 --> 41:50.139
- Well, there you go!

41:50.141 --> 41:52.153
- You think A.J. Canton
is an Uncle Tom?

41:52.154 --> 41:54.166
- It's not his fault that he's
a black man from the inner city

41:54.167 --> 41:56.179
that has to take down another
black man from the inner city.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.781
I mean, can you think

41:57.782 --> 41:59.382
about what
he's probably thinking about?

41:59.383 --> 42:00.983
- You know, I got to tell you,
I've met A.J. Canton.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.285
I think he's a fine man.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.220
I think he's got
a thankless job.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.623
- Listen, personally, I think
the brother's okay, okay?

42:06.625 --> 42:08.191
He kind of reminds me
of something like a black

42:08.193 --> 42:09.759
Harvey Dent,
you know what I'm saying?

42:09.761 --> 42:11.794
He's [inaudible].

42:14.199 --> 42:16.866
- All right. All right, bye.
- Hey, [inaudible].

42:16.868 --> 42:18.535
- What's up, man?
- You know I'm too young

42:18.537 --> 42:20.803
and too pretty
to be up here all laid out.

42:20.805 --> 42:22.805
- I mean, I give you young,
but that's about it.

42:22.807 --> 42:24.073
- What?

42:24.075 --> 42:26.075
Man, you better
get out of here.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.177
Uh, look what the, uh,
wind blew in.

42:28.179 --> 42:29.979
- Be nice, Ronnie.
He's nice with the pockets.

42:29.981 --> 42:31.247
- Yeah, yeah.

42:31.249 --> 42:33.783
- What's up, my brothers?
- A.J.

42:34.085 --> 42:36.886
- Bro, what up, yo?

42:36.888 --> 42:42.559
You good? So what's up, yo?
Why it so dead up in here? Huh?

42:44.262 --> 42:46.095
Hey, Bobby,
what you got on the game, man?

42:46.097 --> 42:48.698
I think I might want
to get a piece of that.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.702
Ronnie-Ron, what it is,
brother?

42:53.171 --> 42:56.139
- You keep saying that,
"brother,"

42:56.141 --> 42:59.275
so, uh, we still brothers?

43:00.912 --> 43:02.829
- I'm sorry, what?

43:02.830 --> 43:04.747
- I think you
heard me just fine.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.849
- Yeah, whatever, man.
- So what we having today, man?

43:06.851 --> 43:08.902
- Bobby, you know how I like

43:08.903 --> 43:10.954
to get my hair cut,
man, so you tell me.

43:10.956 --> 43:13.690
Hmm?
What's really good?

43:17.128 --> 43:22.865
All right. All right.
Let's put it out there.

43:24.002 --> 43:25.602
So what's up?

43:25.604 --> 43:27.170
Y'all got a problem
with me or something?

43:27.172 --> 43:29.839
- Is the money that good, A.J?
- There it is.

43:30.175 --> 43:32.675
Is the money that good?

43:32.677 --> 43:34.911
Here I am thinking
I can at least come to the shop

43:34.913 --> 43:37.764
and not have
to hear this garbage.

43:37.765 --> 43:40.616
- Hey, you brought the garbage
to the shop, brother.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.086
- All right, Ron.

43:43.088 --> 43:44.887
Seems like you got an opinion
about this thing.

43:44.889 --> 43:46.255
The floor's all yours.

43:46.257 --> 43:48.358
Go ahead.
Lay it all out for us, Ron.

43:48.360 --> 43:51.127
- Why you got to get your nose
up in everything, hmm?

43:51.129 --> 43:53.246
Nah, I mean, I see you.

43:53.247 --> 43:55.364
You jump from one high-profile
situation to the other,

43:55.367 --> 43:57.266
but you don't actually
try to help anyone,

43:57.268 --> 43:59.936
let alone your own people.
I mean, not unless, of course,

43:59.938 --> 44:01.904
there's a sea of reporters
out there

44:01.906 --> 44:04.774
shoving cameras in your face,
so what happened, man?

44:04.776 --> 44:06.593
- First of all,

44:06.594 --> 44:08.411
who you think you're
talking to right now, hmm?

44:08.413 --> 44:10.813
You see, it seems like you got
all these opinions, right?

44:10.815 --> 44:14.083
But I don't recall you doing
a thing

44:14.085 --> 44:15.752
for the advancement
of black folks.

44:15.754 --> 44:17.153
- Okay, so your doing

44:17.155 --> 44:19.155
something includes
taking down a black man.

44:19.157 --> 44:21.157
- Oh, so check this out.

44:21.159 --> 44:24.727
When Ra-Ra got shot, right,
after he got pulled over,

44:24.729 --> 44:27.263
it was cool for me
to prosecute that white man.

44:27.265 --> 44:29.265
- No, hold on, man.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on!

44:29.267 --> 44:31.968
Hold on! It's cool for me to
prosecute the white man, right?

44:31.970 --> 44:35.071
But as soon as a white boy
from the 'burbs loses his life

44:35.073 --> 44:36.406
and I take the case,

44:36.408 --> 44:38.107
now you all want
to come at me like this.

44:38.109 --> 44:39.142
- Oh, you act like you
ain't getting paid!

44:39.144 --> 44:40.727
- Oh, man, come on.

44:40.728 --> 44:42.311
- Like, you want us to think
you just doing this

44:42.313 --> 44:44.080
because it's your civic duty.

44:44.082 --> 44:48.051
- It is my civic duty.
A young man got murdered.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.054
See, y'all seem to be
forgetting exactly

44:51.056 --> 44:52.639
where it is I come from.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.223
- What? Ain't nobody forget
where you come from.

44:54.225 --> 44:56.092
Anybody forget
where he come from?

44:56.094 --> 44:58.361
It's you that forgot
where you come from.

44:58.363 --> 45:00.296
- What?

45:00.298 --> 45:01.898
- That's the second time you
act like you didn't hear me.

45:01.900 --> 45:03.350
Let me ask you a question.

45:03.351 --> 45:04.801
- Go ahead, shoot.
- Where's the bullet?

45:04.803 --> 45:05.968
- Oh, sh--
- No, where's the bullet?

45:05.970 --> 45:07.303
- Here we go again.

45:07.305 --> 45:09.016
- As a matter of fact,
where's the gun?

45:09.017 --> 45:10.728
- Here we go. There it is.

45:10.729 --> 45:12.440
- All right, you gonna
prosecute a young black man,

45:12.444 --> 45:14.477
and you ain't even got
no physical evidence.

45:14.479 --> 45:17.780
- You see that, Bobby?
This brother is now a lawyer.

45:17.782 --> 45:20.316
- Don't seem like
it's that hard to do.

45:20.318 --> 45:22.251
- Mm-hmm.
- Not in our days.

45:22.253 --> 45:23.720
Okay, look, we all know
that you work for yours,

45:23.722 --> 45:25.121
A.J, all right?

45:25.123 --> 45:27.034
And you're running for mayor
and all that,

45:27.035 --> 45:28.946
and you want to be the leader,

45:28.947 --> 45:30.858
but the question is why
you got to take this case?

45:30.862 --> 45:32.729
- So tell me, Ron,

45:32.731 --> 45:35.098
who you think
should take the case, hmm?

45:35.834 --> 45:39.502
See, I'm getting real sick
and tired of this, y'all.

45:39.504 --> 45:43.473
When they started tearing down
the community, I stepped up.

45:43.475 --> 45:46.476
When they ripped the guts
out of the tailor homes,

45:46.478 --> 45:48.177
I was there right beside
the people,

45:48.179 --> 45:50.146
but I can't make a difference

45:50.147 --> 45:52.114
if I just stay right
beside the people.

45:52.117 --> 45:57.153
I have to lead and provide
justice for all the people.

45:57.155 --> 45:59.288
- Let me tell you something,
brother.

46:00.158 --> 46:02.291
I can remember
when Harold Washington,

46:02.293 --> 46:04.894
one of the greatest
to ever grace this city,

46:04.896 --> 46:07.463
<i> would come through these doors</i>
<i> almost every Sunday</i>

46:07.465 --> 46:09.866
<i> after services</i>
<i> at Blackstone Church.</i>

46:09.868 --> 46:13.269
He'd come through that door,
and he'd sit down right here,

46:13.271 --> 46:15.088
right in that seat,

46:15.089 --> 46:16.906
and I remember it like
it was yesterday.

46:16.908 --> 46:21.878
And he would take time away
from actually running this city

46:21.880 --> 46:24.914
to help educate
and spread positive messages

46:24.916 --> 46:29.152
to every man, woman, and child
that came through that door.

46:29.154 --> 46:34.290
He was definitely
one of the best of us,

46:34.292 --> 46:39.061
and I still feel him
beside me today.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.349
- So you still want that
line-up

46:43.350 --> 46:45.200
for all the cameras
gonna be in your face?

46:45.203 --> 46:48.504
[laughter]

46:51.142 --> 46:53.876
- Man, why you got to try
to get so deep on a Sunday?

46:53.878 --> 46:56.479
- You can't take the sermon,
get out the church.

46:57.382 --> 46:59.315
It's all good though.
It's all good, A.J.

46:59.317 --> 47:01.217
- It's all good?
- We'll always have a chair

47:01.218 --> 47:03.118
for you, man,
even after you lose this case.

47:03.121 --> 47:05.171
- Mm-hmm.

47:05.172 --> 47:07.222
Yeah, well, may the right man
win then, all right?

47:07.225 --> 47:09.358
- All right.

47:11.996 --> 47:15.331
- Hey, Kholi, how you doing
this evening?

47:17.235 --> 47:19.535
I've been meaning
to ask you a question.

47:20.872 --> 47:22.371
- Shoot.

47:22.373 --> 47:24.907
- How's your spiritual
life, man?

47:27.512 --> 47:31.447
- I go to church. I'm good.

47:31.449 --> 47:34.617
- I'm not asking how long
you been going to church.

47:35.053 --> 47:39.422
Being behind these walls has
given me a chance to reflect,

47:39.424 --> 47:42.892
a chance to capture
a different perspective.

47:42.894 --> 47:44.961
<i> As a priest,</i>

47:44.962 --> 47:47.029
<i> I could quote the scripture</i>
<i> with the best of them,</i>

47:47.031 --> 47:48.865
and although I knew
the Bible really well,

47:48.867 --> 47:51.300
I had never taken time
to actually know

47:51.302 --> 47:53.469
the author of the Bible.

47:53.470 --> 47:55.637
<i> The name of God</i>
<i> was present in my life,</i>

47:55.640 --> 47:58.040
<i> but the presence of God</i>
<i> was absent.</i>

47:58.042 --> 48:00.409
<i> I looked the part.</i>
<i> I acted the part,</i>

48:00.411 --> 48:02.411
but I'd never taken a moment
to know God

48:02.413 --> 48:04.881
on a--on a personal level.

48:04.883 --> 48:10.086
- It's just hard, George, since
my mom died, and now this?

48:10.088 --> 48:11.988
- You know, Kholi,

48:11.990 --> 48:14.523
I--I can't pretend to know
what you're going through.

48:16.027 --> 48:19.395
<i> I can understand</i>
<i> wanting to question God.</i>

48:19.397 --> 48:22.515
It's--it's in our nature
to question,

48:22.516 --> 48:25.634
but you know, God does not
allow pain without purpose.

48:27.171 --> 48:28.938
<i> [reflective music]</i>

48:28.940 --> 48:32.041
<i> - ¶ I know you're close, God ¶</i>

48:32.042 --> 48:35.143
<i> ¶ I know you're closer</i>
<i> than you've ever been ¶</i>

48:35.146 --> 48:36.879
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

48:36.880 --> 48:38.613
<i> ¶ Right where you are ¶</i>

48:38.616 --> 48:41.217
- This--this crisis
that you're going through,

48:41.219 --> 48:44.921
it's not meant to destroy you
but rather to develop you.

48:44.923 --> 48:52.061
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

48:58.469 --> 49:00.670
- Why can't I just
enjoy you playing?

49:00.672 --> 49:02.939
- Hey, mister, you said
I could have anything

49:02.941 --> 49:05.942
I want for my birthday.
This is what I want.

49:06.978 --> 49:09.712
Come on, back straight,
arms out.

49:09.714 --> 49:11.614
- Ma, I got this.

49:17.088 --> 49:22.525
<i> - [singing]</i>
<i> Even if you feel alone,</i>

49:22.527 --> 49:27.396
<i> think of me,</i>
<i> and you'll be home.</i>

49:27.398 --> 49:34.370
<i> Of all the things that we</i>
<i> may never know, don't worry.</i>

49:34.372 --> 49:38.407
<i> I'll be there by your side.</i>
Yeah.

49:38.409 --> 49:40.643
- Happy birthday, Mom.

49:40.645 --> 49:44.113
- Thank you. Thank you.

49:46.284 --> 49:49.218
<i> - George, will you pray</i>
<i> for me?</i>

49:49.220 --> 49:53.222
- Heavenly Father, we thank you
for this moment, Lord.

49:53.224 --> 49:56.092
We trust, Lord, that you will
continue to bless his life

49:56.094 --> 50:00.129
with seasons of uncommon favor,
that he would know, Lord,

50:00.131 --> 50:02.031
that the pressures of life

50:02.033 --> 50:04.133
are simply meant
to develop, promote,

50:04.135 --> 50:07.236
and to qualify him for all
that you have in store for him.

50:07.238 --> 50:09.672
Live in him.
Express yourself through him,

50:09.674 --> 50:12.575
and may he know you
in a sovereign way.

50:13.511 --> 50:16.412
We thank you for it, Lord.
Amen.

50:16.414 --> 50:17.847
- They have no prints,

50:17.848 --> 50:19.281
so he--they shouldn't
even be holding him.

50:19.283 --> 50:20.683
- Right.

50:20.685 --> 50:22.196
- If anything, he should
be out on bond.

50:22.197 --> 50:23.708
- He was screaming for help.

50:23.709 --> 50:25.220
Why would he do that
if he was the killer?

50:25.223 --> 50:27.023
- I don't know, man.
I'd probably go miles away,

50:27.025 --> 50:28.557
then call the police
or something like that.

50:28.559 --> 50:30.559
- No one expects a killer
to stick around

50:30.561 --> 50:33.162
and call for help.
Isn't that the perfect cover?

50:33.164 --> 50:35.197
- He was murdered by someone.
- Right.

50:35.199 --> 50:36.532
- We still don't know who.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.267
- Didn't they find him
with a gun,

50:38.269 --> 50:39.802
what's this guy's name,
Coca-Kholi No-Styles?

50:39.804 --> 50:41.604
- And you bringing a wallet
back to him,

50:41.606 --> 50:43.131
that's not a good--it
look like you robbed him

50:43.132 --> 50:44.657
and killed him
and then came back.

50:44.658 --> 50:46.183
- If the white kid was standing
over the black body

50:46.184 --> 50:47.709
and everybody ran up,
they'd be like,

50:47.712 --> 50:49.412
"Hey, man, what happened, man?"
- Right.

50:49.414 --> 50:51.014
- The first thing
they would think is,

50:51.015 --> 50:52.615
"We need to call--"
- Are you okay?

50:52.617 --> 50:53.883
- You right, yeah.
- No, that's it, yeah, yeah.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.150
- It's tragic for his family.

50:55.153 --> 50:56.608
- It's tragic. I mean--

50:56.609 --> 50:58.064
- But imagine how tragic it is
for Kholi's family.

50:58.065 --> 50:59.520
- They do not put people
in prison for nothing.

50:59.524 --> 51:01.641
- What?

51:01.642 --> 51:03.759
- Where have you been for...
- Okay, all right.

51:03.761 --> 51:06.128
- Like, the past 200 years?
- Basically, he's toast.

51:06.130 --> 51:08.431
That's what all the kids are
saying at the school, anyway.

51:08.433 --> 51:12.068
- Well, I think they have good
as his chance as anyone.

51:12.470 --> 51:14.837
- You really believe that?
- Yeah.

51:14.839 --> 51:17.139
They're gonna try it
in the city, so, you know,

51:17.141 --> 51:19.175
race is not
really gonna be a question.

51:19.177 --> 51:20.743
- Babe, you might as well do it
on the moon.

51:20.745 --> 51:22.845
I mean, it's not
about the location.

51:22.847 --> 51:26.549
Location doesn't mean anything.
It's about public perception.

51:26.551 --> 51:28.484
You can't take race
out of that.

51:28.486 --> 51:30.119
- He's not being persecuted

51:30.120 --> 51:31.753
because
he's an African-American kid.

51:31.756 --> 51:34.457
He's being persecuted
because he's covered with blood

51:34.459 --> 51:36.392
with a dead kid at his feet.

51:36.393 --> 51:38.326
- This is still a world
of race issues, yes, right?

51:38.329 --> 51:41.119
- Yes.

51:41.120 --> 51:43.910
<i> - And this trial is gonna</i>
<i> be Sisyphus</i>

51:43.911 --> 51:46.701
pushing the boulder up the hill
again and again and again.

51:46.704 --> 51:48.738
- Uh-huh.
- And it's not gonna stop,

51:48.739 --> 51:50.773
and those people up there
with their newspapers,

51:50.775 --> 51:53.576
they're gonna be
force-feeding us articles

51:53.578 --> 51:55.011
about their local opinion.

51:55.012 --> 51:56.445
- You all remember
the Central Park Five?

51:56.447 --> 51:58.464
- Of course.

51:58.465 --> 52:00.482
- 1989, a woman is jogging
through the park, is raped.

52:00.485 --> 52:02.302
Five men, all black,

52:02.303 --> 52:04.120
stand accused and profess
their innocence, right?

52:04.122 --> 52:05.721
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Quinn.
What is your point?

52:05.723 --> 52:07.089
- To get perspective,
to get personal. In 2002--

52:07.090 --> 52:08.456
- On what?
This is not the same case.

52:08.459 --> 52:10.042
- Those men were vindicated

52:10.043 --> 52:11.626
when the real rapist
was found through DNA.

52:11.629 --> 52:13.262
- If the roles were reversed,

52:13.264 --> 52:15.664
they would have seen Brian
as innocent.

52:15.666 --> 52:17.766
- You're Muslim.
- Oh.

52:17.768 --> 52:21.737
- I'm Jewish. We have fears.
We're both, to an extent,

52:21.739 --> 52:23.739
<i> afraid</i>
<i> of the natural prejudices</i>

52:23.741 --> 52:26.275
that come with us
as being who we are.

52:26.277 --> 52:27.810
That's what
this whole case is about.

52:27.812 --> 52:30.479
- I don't believe that racism
is something

52:30.481 --> 52:32.148
that we come into the Earth

52:32.150 --> 52:35.251
as humans naturally
participating in.

52:35.253 --> 52:38.254
I believe it is a condition
that is taught.

52:38.256 --> 52:40.823
- Why does everything in
Chicago have to be about race?

52:40.825 --> 52:42.691
- Craig, at the end of this day
it has to be

52:42.693 --> 52:45.194
about the facts, okay?

52:45.195 --> 52:47.696
And to accept that it isn't
something I'm prepared to do.

52:47.698 --> 52:49.298
- Well, then I hope
you're right.

52:49.300 --> 52:50.799
- So do you think he's
innocent, Brenda?

52:50.801 --> 52:52.624
<i> - No, I think he's guilty,</i>

52:52.625 --> 52:54.448
<i> and I think he should go</i>
<i> to jail for life.</i>

52:54.449 --> 52:56.272
- All right, Brenda. Thank you
very much for your call.

52:56.274 --> 52:59.241
- What if it's all said
and done, Kholi's not guilty?

52:59.243 --> 53:00.826
He's innocent?

53:00.827 --> 53:02.410
- So no matter what,
this guy's being crucified

53:02.413 --> 53:03.779
and judged in the media,

53:03.781 --> 53:05.447
and that's
another life destroyed.

53:05.449 --> 53:06.815
It's sad.
These are two kids.

53:06.817 --> 53:09.718
- But at the same time,
if he is guilty,

53:09.720 --> 53:13.589
he does need to be in jail
for the rest of his life

53:13.591 --> 53:15.958
because Brian's mother
and Brian's dad

53:15.960 --> 53:18.460
cannot get another moment
with their son.

53:25.670 --> 53:27.670
- [sighs]

53:27.672 --> 53:29.939
So this is all
they have, huh?

53:29.941 --> 53:32.641
Well, I wouldn't call
this much of a plan.

53:32.643 --> 53:34.877
- Could be better,
but you know,

53:34.879 --> 53:37.613
Jackie really believes
what Kholi's telling him.

53:37.615 --> 53:40.649
- I know my son,
and he wouldn't do this.

53:40.651 --> 53:42.718
- And you, what do you think?

53:42.719 --> 53:44.786
Do you still believe
that this boy did it?

53:45.856 --> 53:48.390
- There may be a bit of doubt.

53:49.694 --> 53:51.493
- Hmm.

54:07.311 --> 54:10.012
- [crying]

54:15.519 --> 54:18.420
- How are you holding up?

54:18.421 --> 54:21.322
- I wish everyone asking me
that would stop. I'm fine.

54:21.959 --> 54:25.261
- I feel bad. It was my party.

54:25.263 --> 54:28.297
- You weren't handing out guns
at the door, were you?

54:28.833 --> 54:30.566
- Look, I didn't know
Brian that well,

54:30.568 --> 54:33.802
but he seemed like a nice guy.

54:33.804 --> 54:36.038
- Is there a reason
you're talking to me, Zoey?

54:36.040 --> 54:40.542
- Look, my parents died,
car crash six years ago.

54:40.945 --> 54:43.946
I still don't talk
about it with anybody,

54:43.948 --> 54:46.048
not even my sister.

54:47.518 --> 54:49.151
- That was about the time

54:49.152 --> 54:50.785
I moved in with
my uncle and aunt.

54:51.355 --> 54:53.555
You were with him
that night, Kholi?

54:54.292 --> 54:56.492
- Yeah.
- He seem like a nice guy?

54:58.362 --> 55:00.329
- Yeah, he does.

55:04.902 --> 55:08.037
- Nobody can say
he didn't have it coming.

55:08.039 --> 55:12.041
He pissed off a lot of people,
but he was good to me,

55:12.043 --> 55:14.343
and I loved him.

55:14.345 --> 55:17.713
He had such an ego, you know?
He was so confident.

55:17.715 --> 55:19.515
That's why I liked him.

55:20.618 --> 55:25.387
No... I loved him.

55:28.359 --> 55:31.960
Brian could always
hold a grudge,

55:31.962 --> 55:34.596
but I never thought
he'd end up dead.

55:36.634 --> 55:38.467
<i> [knocking at door]</i>

55:40.338 --> 55:42.188
- Hello.

55:42.189 --> 55:44.039
Mr. Manheim, is that right?
- Yes?

55:44.041 --> 55:46.709
- I'm Nancy Abbas.
I work for Kholi Styles.

55:46.711 --> 55:48.877
We were just wondering
if you'd answer a few questions

55:48.879 --> 55:51.413
regarding the murder
that took place next door.

55:51.415 --> 55:54.483
- Please come in. Come in.
- Okay.

55:54.485 --> 55:55.784
So you were outside
that morning?

55:55.786 --> 55:57.586
- Mm-hmm.

55:57.587 --> 55:59.387
- Must have heard the gunshot
pretty loud and clear.

55:59.390 --> 56:04.793
- I did. I know the sound
of a gun. Ranger, retired.

56:04.795 --> 56:09.998
A gunshot here, it's about as
foreign a sound as you can get.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.735
- So I mean, what did you do
when you heard the shot?

56:12.737 --> 56:14.136
- Well, I ran toward it.

56:14.138 --> 56:16.638
I figured someone
might have gotten hurt.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.907
It only took me a minute
to pinpoint the direction,

56:18.909 --> 56:21.343
but by the time

56:21.344 --> 56:23.778
I got close enough
to see the Sudermill house,

56:23.781 --> 56:25.781
<i> all I could see</i>
<i> was that car taking off</i>

56:25.783 --> 56:27.900
<i> down the road.</i>

56:27.901 --> 56:30.018
- What car?
- I just saw a pair of red

56:30.020 --> 56:33.655
lights speeding off,
getting smaller and smaller.

56:34.558 --> 56:38.127
Body type was like
a Tesla or a Mercedes.

56:39.730 --> 56:43.732
- Okay. And then you saw
Brian alone?

56:44.168 --> 56:47.803
- I saw someone, a body
on the ground,

56:47.805 --> 56:50.706
<i> and by the time</i>
<i> I got back down,</i>

56:50.708 --> 56:54.042
<i> there was Bill holding his son</i>

56:54.044 --> 56:56.678
<i> and that black boy</i>
<i> right beside him.</i>

56:56.680 --> 57:01.417
- Bill Sudermill says he found
Brian around 4:40.

57:01.419 --> 57:04.486
This man heard the gunshot
at 4:30,

57:04.488 --> 57:06.955
took a minute or two
to locate the source,

57:06.957 --> 57:09.825
saw the car drive away
and leave Brian alone.

57:09.827 --> 57:12.094
Then Bill comes out at 4:40

57:12.096 --> 57:14.496
and sees Kholi there
with Brian?

57:14.498 --> 57:16.532
Why would he come back
if he was the killer?

57:16.534 --> 57:18.434
- Nah, that
doesn't mean anything.

57:18.436 --> 57:20.636
- Jackie,
this is our first break.

57:20.638 --> 57:22.438
- No, I tell you what this is.

57:22.440 --> 57:25.174
We've got one senior citizen
who claims he saw

57:25.176 --> 57:28.677
some red lights
far away in the dark.

57:28.679 --> 57:30.429
You know what the county's got?

57:30.430 --> 57:32.180
My son covered
in that boy's blood.

57:32.183 --> 57:34.683
- Okay, but even you have
to admit that this is good.

57:34.685 --> 57:36.496
- Eh.

57:36.497 --> 57:38.308
- Okay, plus
there's still no gun.

57:38.309 --> 57:40.120
- And no bullet to trace it to.
When it comes down to it,

57:40.124 --> 57:42.458
that could be the only thing
that exonerates Kholi.

57:42.460 --> 57:44.960
In this town, they've already
strung the noose.

57:45.663 --> 57:47.930
No one's gonna do the heavy
lifting for us.

57:47.932 --> 57:49.531
- Frank's right.

57:49.533 --> 57:50.999
- You know, maybe this doesn't
seal the deal,

57:51.001 --> 57:53.035
but at least
it's a shadow of proof

57:53.037 --> 57:55.137
that there might be
somebody else.

57:56.874 --> 58:00.008
- So find the bullet.

58:00.010 --> 58:02.478
<i> - They think I'm a murderer.</i>

58:02.480 --> 58:04.713
The guards look at me
like I'm nothing.

58:05.516 --> 58:08.116
The dudes look at me
like a pushover.

58:08.586 --> 58:12.554
- Are they keeping you safe?
- My roommate is a priest.

58:12.990 --> 58:16.158
He's cool, but once
I go to the cafeteria,

58:16.160 --> 58:17.726
once I go to the gym--

58:17.728 --> 58:19.928
- We may have a witness.

58:19.930 --> 58:22.197
A man says
that he saw a car pull away

58:22.199 --> 58:25.801
just after the murder.
It was before you went back.

58:26.770 --> 58:29.037
- That's great.

58:29.039 --> 58:31.773
- You should be a little
happier, son.

58:35.913 --> 58:38.146
- You think I'm a murderer?

58:39.283 --> 58:41.884
If Ma was here,
she would believe me.

58:41.886 --> 58:45.187
- No, son,
I didn't raise a murderer,

58:45.189 --> 58:48.190
and your mother,
your mother does believe you.

58:49.059 --> 58:51.109
She saw everything.

58:51.110 --> 58:53.160
She has the best seat
in the house,

58:53.163 --> 58:54.930
and your mother knows
you didn't kill that boy.

58:54.932 --> 58:56.632
Do you understand?

58:56.634 --> 59:02.104
- I just want to go home.
I didn't kill nobody.

59:04.208 --> 59:08.143
<i> - 107.5 WGCI, you're live</i>
<i> with Kendra G.</i>

59:08.145 --> 59:10.145
You know today is trial day.

59:10.147 --> 59:14.983
- Kholi Styles is facing life
in prison,

59:14.985 --> 59:16.818
<i> on trial right now,</i>
<i> as we speak.</i>

59:16.820 --> 59:18.253
<i> - If Kholi Styles were white,</i>

59:18.254 --> 59:19.687
<i> would we be having</i>
<i> this same discussion?</i>

59:19.690 --> 59:21.223
- Absolutely not.

59:21.225 --> 59:22.824
First of all, you'd have
no reason to talk to me.

59:22.826 --> 59:23.992
He wouldn't be in jail.

59:23.994 --> 59:26.094
- All rise.

59:26.096 --> 59:28.830
<i> - The prosecutor is also</i>
<i> black, A.J. Canton.</i>

59:28.832 --> 59:32.100
He's also from
a similar background as Kholi.

59:32.102 --> 59:34.102
- I mean, why is he taking
this case?

59:34.104 --> 59:35.771
What is his personal
motivation?

59:35.773 --> 59:37.973
- Well, I think
it's a high-profile case,

59:37.975 --> 59:39.575
career aspirations.
Think about it.

59:39.577 --> 59:41.109
I think it seems
pretty obvious,

59:41.111 --> 59:43.078
or there's an obvious answer,
at least.

59:43.080 --> 59:45.747
- The Honorable Judge
Renita Hailey presiding.

59:45.749 --> 59:47.749
- You may sit.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.818
- Kholi is also being judged

59:49.820 --> 59:52.054
because of the stereotypes
of Chicago right now.

59:52.056 --> 59:53.655
- Mm-hmm.

59:53.657 --> 59:55.223
- The inner city's
pulling for Kholi,

59:55.225 --> 59:57.593
but meanwhile I feel like
everywhere else

59:57.595 --> 59:59.728
they're kind of--everybody
thinks he did it.

59:59.730 --> 1:00:04.733
- Brian and Kholi had
a contentious relationship,

1:00:04.735 --> 1:00:06.134
did they not?

1:00:06.136 --> 1:00:07.169
- They got into it
the first time they met,

1:00:07.171 --> 1:00:08.721
if that's what you mean.

1:00:08.722 --> 1:00:10.272
- A fistfight?
- Might as well have been.

1:00:10.274 --> 1:00:12.274
- Well, what was it about?

1:00:12.276 --> 1:00:14.176
- They just didn't
like each other.

1:00:14.178 --> 1:00:17.145
- Now, Brian and Kholi
rode home together.

1:00:17.648 --> 1:00:20.015
Could it be
they patched things up?

1:00:20.017 --> 1:00:22.050
- Maybe, but if you knew Brian,

1:00:22.052 --> 1:00:23.719
you knew he had
a pretty hot temper.

1:00:23.721 --> 1:00:25.187
He could be your best friend
one minute

1:00:25.189 --> 1:00:27.289
and your worst enemy the next.

1:00:27.291 --> 1:00:31.893
- How long had you and Brian
been dating before he died?

1:00:31.895 --> 1:00:33.395
- Two years.

1:00:33.397 --> 1:00:36.632
- Wow, that's a long time
for two teenagers.

1:00:36.634 --> 1:00:38.734
- I know, but we were in love.

1:00:39.069 --> 1:00:41.837
- And that night,
when you saw your boyfriend

1:00:41.839 --> 1:00:45.307
for the last time,
what was his demeanor?

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:48.310
- This conversation is over.
- Why are you yelling at me?

1:00:48.312 --> 1:00:51.647
- This conversation is over.
- I loved him,

1:00:51.649 --> 1:00:55.117
but sometimes it was
just like he flipped a switch.

1:00:55.119 --> 1:00:59.254
- Mm. Then is it possible
that night,

1:00:59.256 --> 1:01:01.990
despite Brian's good mood,

1:01:01.992 --> 1:01:04.393
that he may have flipped
a switch,

1:01:04.395 --> 1:01:08.330
as you said,
and antagonized Kholi Styles,

1:01:08.332 --> 1:01:12.334
and in turn Kholi may have
flipped a switch on him?

1:01:14.104 --> 1:01:17.873
- I guess so, maybe.

1:01:17.875 --> 1:01:19.174
Yes.

1:01:19.176 --> 1:01:24.179
- You were there the night
of that basketball game, right?

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:26.415
What was your
impression of Kholi?

1:01:26.417 --> 1:01:28.383
- I just want to see
what you can do.

1:01:28.385 --> 1:01:30.018
- You keep pressuring me,
I'ma show you what I can do.

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:31.820
- I got a bad vibe.

1:01:31.822 --> 1:01:36.858
- Elizabeth, did you feel
safe around him?

1:01:42.099 --> 1:01:43.432
- No.

1:01:45.703 --> 1:01:47.836
I didn't.

1:01:47.838 --> 1:01:49.838
- Thank you.

1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:52.174
- The latest developments
in our ongoing coverage

1:01:52.176 --> 1:01:54.176
of Black, White, and Red.

1:01:54.178 --> 1:01:56.745
With the trial of Kholi Styles
well underway,

1:01:56.747 --> 1:01:59.748
speculation is circulating
as to whether or not

1:01:59.750 --> 1:02:03.018
Assistant State's Attorney
and mayoral candidate A.J.

1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:05.721
<i> Canton will once</i>
<i> again seek life.</i>

1:02:05.723 --> 1:02:07.789
- We have all these
anti-gun programs

1:02:07.791 --> 1:02:10.459
and anti-drug programs,
but there's no program

1:02:10.461 --> 1:02:13.862
strong enough
to counter bad influences.

1:02:13.864 --> 1:02:15.814
Turn that off.

1:02:15.815 --> 1:02:17.765
- I want to see you on TV.
- I said turn it off.

1:02:17.768 --> 1:02:20.402
- A.J., all right, don't talk
to them like that.

1:02:20.404 --> 1:02:22.137
They care about you,

1:02:22.139 --> 1:02:23.805
and they're interested
in what you do.

1:02:23.807 --> 1:02:27.009
- I know, 'Toy.

1:02:27.010 --> 1:02:30.212
- Besides, seeing you
on television like that kind of

1:02:30.213 --> 1:02:33.415
makes you a little famous.
Now do what you got to do.

1:02:38.922 --> 1:02:40.122
- Hey, guys.

1:02:40.124 --> 1:02:41.456
- Are you mad at us?

1:02:41.458 --> 1:02:45.827
- Nah, buddy.
Daddy is not mad at you.

1:02:45.829 --> 1:02:48.530
I just didn't want you guys
to see me like that.

1:02:48.532 --> 1:02:50.799
- But you've been on
TV before, dad.

1:02:50.801 --> 1:02:53.869
We've seen you get interviewed
for things lots of times.

1:02:53.871 --> 1:02:59.040
- I know, and you're right,
but this time, this case...

1:03:00.144 --> 1:03:02.377
What they're saying
about your dad

1:03:02.379 --> 1:03:06.381
and what my plans are,
this time it's different.

1:03:07.184 --> 1:03:09.718
Do you guys understand why?

1:03:09.719 --> 1:03:12.253
- Did you do something wrong?
Are you gonna be in trouble?

1:03:12.256 --> 1:03:13.922
- No, no, no, no.

1:03:13.924 --> 1:03:15.791
I'm not gonna be
in any trouble, all right?

1:03:15.793 --> 1:03:18.393
- Why were you so upset?
Was it because of what happened

1:03:18.395 --> 1:03:20.929
at the barber shop
with Uncle Ronnie?

1:03:20.931 --> 1:03:23.298
- A little bit.

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:26.434
But look, what I want you guys
to understand is that

1:03:26.436 --> 1:03:30.872
God made this beautiful world
of right and wrong.

1:03:30.874 --> 1:03:36.344
Now, sometimes it's just that,
black or white, no in between.

1:03:36.346 --> 1:03:40.482
- But sometimes the world
shakes things up a bit

1:03:40.484 --> 1:03:43.952
and gives us
this lukewarm gray area,

1:03:43.954 --> 1:03:47.122
and that's what's happening
with your dad's case.

1:03:47.124 --> 1:03:50.959
A lot of people out there,
especially the media,

1:03:50.961 --> 1:03:52.961
are gonna try to take advantage
of the community

1:03:52.963 --> 1:03:54.980
and everyone in it,

1:03:54.981 --> 1:03:56.998
and their biggest piece
of ammunition is your father

1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.668
and what his plans are.

1:03:59.669 --> 1:04:02.337
- You see, they're gonna try to
paint me as a bad guy,

1:04:02.339 --> 1:04:06.441
and I just hoped
I could still be your hero

1:04:06.443 --> 1:04:08.476
for just a little bit longer.

1:04:08.478 --> 1:04:10.245
- Don't worry, Daddy.

1:04:10.247 --> 1:04:13.381
I won't let anyone
put any pain on you.

1:04:13.383 --> 1:04:15.617
- [laughing]

1:04:15.619 --> 1:04:20.255
Come here, little man.
You too. Get over here.

1:04:20.257 --> 1:04:24.292
Come on. Daddy loves you.
You're my babies.

1:04:24.294 --> 1:04:27.495
And you too, my big baby.

1:04:27.497 --> 1:04:31.533
- Mm-hmm.
- I love you.

1:04:34.304 --> 1:04:36.404
- You may call
your next witness.

1:04:37.541 --> 1:04:40.075
- The state calls Marcus Jones.

1:04:48.418 --> 1:04:51.786
- I'll tell you the truth,
MayMay.

1:04:51.787 --> 1:04:55.155
I don't like people like you,
and I know if I dig around,

1:04:55.158 --> 1:04:58.493
I'm gonna find a family
of people just like you.

1:04:58.495 --> 1:05:02.030
- Mr. Jones, please face me,
raise your right hand.

1:05:03.033 --> 1:05:04.900
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1:05:04.902 --> 1:05:07.435
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

1:05:07.437 --> 1:05:10.338
- I do.
- Look, MayMay, you saw

1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:13.308
that Kholi
didn't pop Brian, right?

1:05:13.310 --> 1:05:16.578
So we need you
to testify under oath.

1:05:16.580 --> 1:05:19.014
- Test--come on, man.
You got my sheet.

1:05:19.016 --> 1:05:20.360
I walk in that room,

1:05:20.361 --> 1:05:21.705
those people take one
look at me,

1:05:21.706 --> 1:05:23.050
and they gonna think I'm lying.

1:05:23.053 --> 1:05:25.186
- You got a brother, 23.

1:05:28.592 --> 1:05:32.060
You got a crackhead mama,
Lord have mercy.

1:05:34.598 --> 1:05:38.199
And you got a daughter,
little Tanya.

1:05:40.404 --> 1:05:43.104
You don't got a daddy
no more, do you?

1:05:49.179 --> 1:05:51.346
- Forget all what they may
or may not think.

1:05:51.348 --> 1:05:54.549
We need you, all right?
Kholi needs you.

1:05:54.551 --> 1:05:56.651
You gonna help us?

1:05:58.088 --> 1:06:00.956
- Now, you're gonna tell me
right now who did it.

1:06:00.958 --> 1:06:03.558
You tell me
who pulled the trigger.

1:06:05.095 --> 1:06:10.398
- Mr. Jones, you were
at the party with Mr. Styles.

1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:13.101
I mean, you two were
best friends, right?

1:06:14.004 --> 1:06:15.403
- Yes.

1:06:15.405 --> 1:06:17.405
- And you were with him
the whole night,

1:06:17.407 --> 1:06:21.509
from approximately 6:30 p.m.
to 4:00 a.m.,

1:06:21.511 --> 1:06:24.012
right by his side
the whole time?

1:06:24.014 --> 1:06:25.513
- No.

1:06:25.515 --> 1:06:27.582
He was in that girl's room
for about an hour.

1:06:27.584 --> 1:06:29.684
I didn't see him again
till after that.

1:06:29.686 --> 1:06:33.455
- Will the court please
allow me to present exhibit G,

1:06:33.457 --> 1:06:35.623
a 9-millimeter handgun,
into evidence?

1:06:35.625 --> 1:06:37.525
- We will.
- Thank you.

1:06:37.527 --> 1:06:39.728
- [whispering]
Did we know about this?

1:06:39.730 --> 1:06:41.563
- [whispering]
I'll check with Frank.

1:06:41.565 --> 1:06:44.883
Now he finds a gun?

1:06:44.884 --> 1:06:48.202
- Mr. Jones, is this your gun?
- Yes.

1:06:49.072 --> 1:06:51.673
- And how did it wind up
in court today?

1:06:52.676 --> 1:06:56.177
- The police,
they found it under my bed.

1:06:56.179 --> 1:07:01.016
- Was this the gun used to kill
Briand Sudermill?

1:07:02.219 --> 1:07:04.152
- Yes.

1:07:04.621 --> 1:07:07.088
- So was it you that
shot Brian?

1:07:07.090 --> 1:07:10.125
- No, sir, I did not.

1:07:10.126 --> 1:07:13.161
- Okay, okay, so if you didn't
murder him, then who did?

1:07:14.598 --> 1:07:16.164
- Kholi.
- What?!

1:07:16.166 --> 1:07:18.033
- Objection!
- I don't know why.

1:07:18.035 --> 1:07:19.234
I had it on me
when I got in the car.

1:07:19.236 --> 1:07:20.736
I guess he slipped it off--

1:07:20.737 --> 1:07:22.237
- Your Honor, this is a clear
violation of disclosure.

1:07:22.239 --> 1:07:23.605
- We will have order.

1:07:23.606 --> 1:07:24.972
- Maybe that was his plan
the whole time,

1:07:24.973 --> 1:07:26.339
to shoot him in the street.

1:07:26.340 --> 1:07:27.706
That's all they need.
You have to go.

1:07:27.711 --> 1:07:30.378
- He's dead, Kholi.
Get in the car.

1:07:30.380 --> 1:07:33.815
- We had no prior knowledge
of this gun or this witness.

1:07:33.817 --> 1:07:36.351
Mr. Canton here has clearly
and deliberately

1:07:36.353 --> 1:07:38.486
withheld this information,
and we move for a mistrial.

1:07:38.488 --> 1:07:39.938
- Quiet.

1:07:39.939 --> 1:07:41.389
- He shot him, and I grabbed
the gun and took off.

1:07:41.391 --> 1:07:42.707
I don't know. We panicked.

1:07:42.708 --> 1:07:44.024
- The jury will ignore
this outburst.

1:07:44.025 --> 1:07:45.341
- So MayMay, you saying
I pulled the trigger?

1:07:45.342 --> 1:07:46.658
- We will have order
in this court.

1:07:46.663 --> 1:07:49.514
- You killed Brian!
Yes, you pulled the trigger.

1:07:49.515 --> 1:07:52.366
- Mr. Jones, that is enough.
- Where Lashawn at?

1:07:52.369 --> 1:07:56.204
- You can't help Kholi?
- I want to, but I can't.

1:07:56.206 --> 1:07:59.574
- You know what that is?

1:07:59.576 --> 1:08:00.992
- Why you doing this?

1:08:00.993 --> 1:08:02.409
- 'Cause you pulled
the trigger!

1:08:02.412 --> 1:08:03.711
You killed Brian!

1:08:03.713 --> 1:08:06.214
- Bailiff. That is enough!
Bailiff.

1:08:06.216 --> 1:08:07.615
- Get off! Get off!
- [shouting]

1:08:07.617 --> 1:08:09.184
- Stop lying!

1:08:09.185 --> 1:08:10.752
- Take the jury
into their holding.

1:08:10.754 --> 1:08:12.287
- Tell the people the truth!

1:08:12.288 --> 1:08:13.821
- I will see counsel
in my chambers now.

1:08:13.824 --> 1:08:15.690
- Objection!
No, he can't do this!

1:08:15.692 --> 1:08:18.560
- Get off me! Get off me!

1:08:18.562 --> 1:08:20.628
Dad! Dad!

1:08:20.630 --> 1:08:23.298
Get off me!
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:25.767
<i> - This is outrageous.</i>
<i> We get no discovery,</i>

1:08:25.769 --> 1:08:27.735
and then the prosecution
whips out a gun.

1:08:27.737 --> 1:08:29.571
This jury can't unsee
that pistol,

1:08:29.573 --> 1:08:31.573
and they can't unhear
that false testimony!

1:08:31.575 --> 1:08:34.876
- Calm down, Mr. Styles.
What is this?

1:08:34.878 --> 1:08:36.678
- The end of this case,
Your Honor,

1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:38.964
and for a lack
of a better term,

1:08:38.965 --> 1:08:41.249
he just heard the last nail
hammer into that coffin,

1:08:41.251 --> 1:08:43.284
and understandably
they're panicking.

1:08:43.286 --> 1:08:45.487
- Neither ASA Canton nor the
State's Attorney's Office

1:08:45.489 --> 1:08:46.788
provided any information

1:08:46.790 --> 1:08:48.623
regarding
the discovery of this gun.

1:08:48.625 --> 1:08:50.525
Canton deliberately
withheld this information,

1:08:50.527 --> 1:08:52.660
thereby robbing this defense
of the time

1:08:52.662 --> 1:08:54.796
to prepare
a proper cross-examination.

1:08:54.798 --> 1:08:56.798
- He's just mad his son's
little hood friends

1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:58.666
aren't gonna back up
his nonsense story.

1:08:58.668 --> 1:09:00.902
- You have no idea
what you're talking about.

1:09:00.904 --> 1:09:02.837
Your Honor, if you're not gonna
give me the mistrial,

1:09:02.839 --> 1:09:04.506
the least you could do
is sanction the prosecutor...

1:09:04.508 --> 1:09:05.907
- What?
- By tossing out

1:09:05.908 --> 1:09:07.307
the witness's entire statement.

1:09:07.310 --> 1:09:10.512
- Your Honor, we can see
that he is clearly blind

1:09:10.514 --> 1:09:12.447
and distracted
when it comes to his son

1:09:12.449 --> 1:09:14.916
and justice
for Brain Sudermill!

1:09:14.917 --> 1:09:17.384
- That is enough.
Now, Mr. Canton, is he right?

1:09:17.387 --> 1:09:19.721
Did your office withhold this
information from the defense?

1:09:19.723 --> 1:09:22.073
- Your Honor--

1:09:22.074 --> 1:09:24.424
- And think before
you answer me.

1:09:25.529 --> 1:09:29.297
- Your Honor, we only became
aware of Mr. Jones's desire

1:09:29.299 --> 1:09:31.566
to testify this morning.

1:09:31.567 --> 1:09:33.834
Up until then we had
no intention of putting one

1:09:33.837 --> 1:09:36.571
of the defendant's
best friends on the stand.

1:09:36.573 --> 1:09:38.540
That's nonsensical.
What prosecutor

1:09:38.542 --> 1:09:40.575
in their right mind
would do something like that?

1:09:40.577 --> 1:09:42.310
- And yet you did.

1:09:42.312 --> 1:09:43.845
- Marcus reached out
from Cook County

1:09:43.847 --> 1:09:45.713
and requested to be here.

1:09:45.715 --> 1:09:47.749
He said that he had
to tell the truth,

1:09:47.750 --> 1:09:49.784
that what was going on
was eating him up inside.

1:09:49.786 --> 1:09:51.886
- You got to be kidding me!
- My God.

1:09:51.888 --> 1:09:54.222
- Your Honor, I'm sorry.
This is classic sandbagging.

1:09:54.224 --> 1:09:55.924
- Oh, come on.

1:09:55.925 --> 1:09:57.625
- You can't just pop up
with evidence

1:09:57.626 --> 1:09:59.326
in the middle of a trial
and expect me to cross-examine,

1:09:59.329 --> 1:10:01.663
and there's no way that MayMay,
my son's best friend

1:10:01.665 --> 1:10:03.932
from childhood,
suddenly wanted to just flip

1:10:03.934 --> 1:10:06.434
and make those
outrageous statements.

1:10:06.436 --> 1:10:09.237
I've known that boy too long.
He wouldn't.

1:10:09.239 --> 1:10:10.939
- Your Honor, if you would
check with the prison,

1:10:10.941 --> 1:10:12.840
I'm sure there's
a record of the call,

1:10:12.842 --> 1:10:15.410
and then he can see that
when we got it and followed up,

1:10:15.412 --> 1:10:17.462
there would be no time

1:10:17.463 --> 1:10:19.513
to have this formal
sit-down discovery session!

1:10:19.516 --> 1:10:22.584
- What about the gun?
- That came even later,

1:10:22.586 --> 1:10:25.470
Your Honor.

1:10:25.471 --> 1:10:28.355
I promise you that everything
is legit, legal,

1:10:28.358 --> 1:10:30.258
and on the up-and-up here.

1:10:30.260 --> 1:10:34.362
I'm sorry, man, all right?
I truly, truly am.

1:10:34.364 --> 1:10:37.932
- Don't apologize to me.
You apologize to my son.

1:10:39.536 --> 1:10:42.237
This ain't over.

1:10:42.238 --> 1:10:44.939
- Styles is falling apart.
His case is paper-thin,

1:10:44.941 --> 1:10:47.242
and it's already started
to crack and wither away.

1:10:47.244 --> 1:10:51.379
- Yeah, I see it.
I'm sure he sees it too.

1:10:52.315 --> 1:10:54.749
- You don't sound
too pleased with that.

1:10:54.751 --> 1:10:57.285
- You're not a father.

1:10:57.287 --> 1:11:00.922
I mean, sure, I mean,
most likely we got it right,

1:11:00.924 --> 1:11:03.925
and Kholi killed
Brian Sudermill,

1:11:03.927 --> 1:11:06.394
but that man is still in there
fighting for his son's life.

1:11:06.396 --> 1:11:09.430
- Well, let's not forget
who he's fighting against.

1:11:09.432 --> 1:11:12.900
Don't start doubting yourself.
That would be suicide.

1:11:12.902 --> 1:11:14.802
- It's not about me
doubting myself or not.

1:11:14.804 --> 1:11:16.638
It's about father-to-father,

1:11:16.639 --> 1:11:18.473
what that man
must be going through.

1:11:18.475 --> 1:11:22.443
Look, I'm about to shatter
what little bit of a world

1:11:22.445 --> 1:11:26.948
he's been able to hold on to,
and I'm gonna do my job.

1:11:28.385 --> 1:11:30.818
Doesn't mean I have
to like doing it.

1:11:33.857 --> 1:11:36.057
- Just make sure you do it.

1:11:38.495 --> 1:11:40.528
<i> - Three, four...</i>

1:11:40.530 --> 1:11:42.764
<i> [acoustic music]</i>

1:11:42.766 --> 1:11:45.733
<i> ¶ All alone again ¶</i>

1:11:45.735 --> 1:11:51.773
<i> ¶ In the evening time,</i>
<i> the feeling time ¶</i>

1:11:51.775 --> 1:11:53.708
- Samuel Billings,

1:11:53.710 --> 1:11:55.810
the interpreter
of the voice of God.

1:11:55.812 --> 1:11:57.979
I go to church.
I have my whole life.

1:11:57.981 --> 1:11:59.914
I know God.
I know right from wrong,

1:11:59.916 --> 1:12:03.384
but you, I can't even take you
seriously for a minute.

1:12:03.386 --> 1:12:04.786
Was my son perfect?

1:12:04.788 --> 1:12:08.556
No, but he didn't deserve
what he got.

1:12:08.558 --> 1:12:09.991
I've seen you on television,

1:12:09.993 --> 1:12:12.660
heard your interviews
on my son's case.

1:12:12.662 --> 1:12:14.612
You're a performer.

1:12:14.613 --> 1:12:16.563
Is this a church,
or is this a concert venue?

1:12:16.566 --> 1:12:18.044
- All right, Mr. Sudermill.

1:12:18.045 --> 1:12:19.523
Out of respect
for your situation,

1:12:19.524 --> 1:12:21.002
I will allow what you said
to be forgotten,

1:12:21.004 --> 1:12:22.837
but please don't let
this outfit fool you.

1:12:22.839 --> 1:12:24.639
Jesus is still my Lord,

1:12:24.641 --> 1:12:26.841
and if you keep going on
the route that you're going,

1:12:26.843 --> 1:12:28.476
then the Lord

1:12:28.478 --> 1:12:30.345
will have to protect you
from my next action.

1:12:30.347 --> 1:12:31.746
- Are you threatening me?
- You come to this place

1:12:31.748 --> 1:12:33.315
of worship
making accusations,

1:12:33.316 --> 1:12:34.883
and you're asking me
about threats?

1:12:34.884 --> 1:12:36.451
- Don't try to make this about
anything other than what it is.

1:12:36.453 --> 1:12:38.420
- And what is that?

1:12:38.421 --> 1:12:40.388
- I walked outside
my front door,

1:12:40.389 --> 1:12:42.356
and I saw my son sitting in
a pool of his own blood.

1:12:42.359 --> 1:12:45.693
I don't care what color
Kholi was. He murdered my son.

1:12:45.695 --> 1:12:47.095
- Do you know how long kids

1:12:47.097 --> 1:12:48.629
have been killing kids
outside of these doors?

1:12:48.631 --> 1:12:51.099
- Is that supposed to help me?

1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:53.568
I'm sorry about those kids.
I truly am, but my son is gone,

1:12:53.570 --> 1:12:56.404
and my wife and I
have been drowning ever since

1:12:56.406 --> 1:12:59.674
'cause he was taken, taken by
a monster, a monster that--

1:12:59.676 --> 1:13:03.511
- Chalice Chandler Billings!

1:13:04.147 --> 1:13:07.615
Sir, she was my daughter,
my heart!

1:13:07.617 --> 1:13:11.586
I held her in my arms, okay?
I felt her body turn cold!

1:13:12.455 --> 1:13:13.721
Two holes in her chest,

1:13:13.723 --> 1:13:15.123
and she was only
seven years old.

1:13:15.125 --> 1:13:16.924
Ask me if they solved her case.

1:13:16.926 --> 1:13:19.727
Was this turned into
a Black Lives Matter campaign?

1:13:19.729 --> 1:13:22.897
No. She wasn't gunned
down by a cop.

1:13:22.899 --> 1:13:24.899
Was it a hate crime? No!

1:13:24.901 --> 1:13:26.934
She was riding
on her Power Wheel,

1:13:26.936 --> 1:13:28.970
<i> like she does</i>
<i> every single morning.</i>

1:13:28.972 --> 1:13:33.508
I went inside to get her
a glass of juice. She was safe.

1:13:33.910 --> 1:13:35.810
<i> 30 seconds, I came back,</i>

1:13:35.812 --> 1:13:38.679
and she was gone
just like that.

1:13:38.681 --> 1:13:40.982
- You want me to say I'm sorry?

1:13:40.984 --> 1:13:43.418
How terrible that must have
been for you.

1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:45.420
- Mr. Sudermill, I don't want
anything from you, sir,

1:13:45.422 --> 1:13:48.489
that you can't find
for yourself.

1:13:49.459 --> 1:13:51.659
Your son is gone.

1:13:51.661 --> 1:13:54.762
He's another bright light of
his creation just snuffed out

1:13:54.764 --> 1:13:56.531
before he had
the chance to shine,

1:13:56.533 --> 1:14:00.101
and we are all the lesser
for it, all of us.

1:14:01.438 --> 1:14:02.970
You know,

1:14:02.972 --> 1:14:05.506
you have to give yourself
permission to change course.

1:14:08.111 --> 1:14:10.678
This is more than just a coat
of paint that I'm spraying,

1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:12.613
Mr. Sudermill.

1:14:14.651 --> 1:14:17.985
We may not be able to see
past each other's weakness...

1:14:19.456 --> 1:14:21.656
But we can all find
common ground.

1:14:32.135 --> 1:14:36.003
<i> Father God, I come before you</i>
<i> in prayer, dear Lord,</i>

1:14:36.005 --> 1:14:37.238
to help us understand
the things

1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:39.707
that we just don't understand.

1:14:39.709 --> 1:14:42.577
<i> Just give us the eyes to see</i>
<i> and the ears to hear</i>

1:14:42.579 --> 1:14:44.212
<i> and the heart</i>
<i> to receive your truth</i>

1:14:44.214 --> 1:14:46.647
even when the situations
are tough.

1:14:46.649 --> 1:14:49.150
<i> We honor you, and we thank you</i>
<i> for this moment,</i>

1:14:49.152 --> 1:14:51.586
<i> in Jesus' name, amen.</i>

1:14:52.522 --> 1:14:54.305
<i> - We're debating</i>
<i> all this nonsense.</i>

1:14:54.306 --> 1:14:56.089
<i> You're bringing race into it</i>
<i> that I don't think's fair.</i>

1:14:56.092 --> 1:14:58.393
<i> It's getting away from us.</i>

1:14:58.394 --> 1:15:00.695
<i> - You know, the body is still</i>
<i> in the morgue</i>

1:15:00.696 --> 1:15:02.997
because it's a part
of a crime investigation.

1:15:02.999 --> 1:15:06.801
- We have the body
of Brian Sudermill

1:15:06.803 --> 1:15:10.605
just deep freezing on ice.

1:15:10.607 --> 1:15:13.908
- So they can't release
the body to the funeral home.

1:15:13.910 --> 1:15:16.211
- Oh, that's so sad.

1:15:16.212 --> 1:15:18.513
- Sometimes it takes tragedy
to really discover

1:15:18.515 --> 1:15:21.048
what's the best
in humanity,

1:15:21.050 --> 1:15:22.783
what's really ins--deep down
inside of us.

1:15:22.785 --> 1:15:25.119
- Someone died,
so as we sit here, you know,

1:15:25.121 --> 1:15:26.688
with all our theories

1:15:26.689 --> 1:15:28.256
and everything playing
amateur Columbo,

1:15:28.258 --> 1:15:30.258
I want to dedicate this program
to Brian Sudermill.

1:15:30.260 --> 1:15:32.082
- And Kholi.

1:15:32.083 --> 1:15:33.905
<i> - Yeah, you remember</i>
<i> Brian's name.</i>

1:15:33.906 --> 1:15:35.728
<i> - Who right now is sitting</i>
<i> in jail accused of a crime.</i>

1:15:35.732 --> 1:15:37.048
<i> - I want to dedicate</i>
<i> this program</i>

1:15:37.049 --> 1:15:38.365
<i> to the guy that was killed.</i>

1:15:38.366 --> 1:15:39.682
<i> - Brian told me he'd be</i>
<i> heading out</i>

1:15:39.683 --> 1:15:40.999
<i> to USC with some friends.</i>

1:15:41.004 --> 1:15:43.438
<i> I figured he'd be</i>
<i> going off to college</i>

1:15:43.439 --> 1:15:45.873
on a basketball scholarship
come summer anyway.

1:15:45.875 --> 1:15:48.142
He was ready,
so I figured sure.

1:15:48.945 --> 1:15:51.679
He took off around 6:00.
Turns out he stayed

1:15:51.681 --> 1:15:53.748
right in town
to go to a party that night.

1:15:53.750 --> 1:15:56.984
- And when you opened
the front door?

1:15:56.986 --> 1:15:59.854
- I thought I saw a ghost

1:15:59.856 --> 1:16:01.956
because that couldn't be my boy
laying there, no way.

1:16:01.958 --> 1:16:06.661
I mean, things like this don't
happen to boys like Brian, no.

1:16:06.663 --> 1:16:08.296
I mean, we live
in a good neighborhood.

1:16:08.298 --> 1:16:10.097
This can't happen in Winnetka.

1:16:10.099 --> 1:16:12.667
This is exactly
why we left Indiana.

1:16:12.669 --> 1:16:16.337
And then I see the blood
pooling up behind his head.

1:16:17.106 --> 1:16:21.108
There's a hole going right
through him, right...

1:16:21.110 --> 1:16:23.177
right here.

1:16:23.179 --> 1:16:24.695
He should have been
playing ball this weekend.

1:16:24.696 --> 1:16:26.212
You know, he's been
talking about his game

1:16:26.215 --> 1:16:28.215
every night over dinner.

1:16:28.217 --> 1:16:32.219
I'd--I'd hugged him
just a few hours earlier.

1:16:35.325 --> 1:16:39.126
- And did you see
anybody else out there?

1:16:41.030 --> 1:16:43.130
- Yes.

1:16:44.100 --> 1:16:45.833
I didn't get a good look
at him at first.

1:16:45.835 --> 1:16:47.985
All I saw was blood.

1:16:47.986 --> 1:16:50.136
I saw his--his legs,
his--his chest, his hands.

1:16:50.139 --> 1:16:52.607
They were all painted red.

1:16:52.609 --> 1:16:56.844
And when I got a good look
at his face...

1:16:56.846 --> 1:16:58.713
it was blank.

1:16:58.715 --> 1:17:01.182
- Can you point him out
in the court today?

1:17:08.091 --> 1:17:11.959
- Mr. Sudermill,
you've already lost a son.

1:17:11.961 --> 1:17:15.696
Here I risk losing mine.

1:17:16.265 --> 1:17:19.033
Sir, did you see Kholi Styles
pull the trigger?

1:17:19.669 --> 1:17:22.670
- No.
- So you heard the gunshot,

1:17:22.672 --> 1:17:25.139
but you didn't come downstairs
right away, correct?

1:17:25.141 --> 1:17:27.842
- We don't hear guns
in my neighborhood.

1:17:27.844 --> 1:17:30.461
It was a bit startling.

1:17:30.462 --> 1:17:33.079
- So how long after the time
that you heard the gunshot

1:17:33.082 --> 1:17:35.082
before you'd gone outside?

1:17:35.084 --> 1:17:38.736
- Five minutes.
- Mm.

1:17:38.737 --> 1:17:42.389
So five minutes after you heard
the gunshot you went downstairs

1:17:42.392 --> 1:17:45.726
to see the person that
you believed to be the killer?

1:17:45.728 --> 1:17:47.194
- Yes, I saw your son.

1:17:47.196 --> 1:17:49.797
I believe I made
that quite clear.

1:17:50.133 --> 1:17:52.150
- Sir, what is the likelihood
that someone

1:17:52.151 --> 1:17:54.168
who had just committed
a murder would stick around

1:17:54.170 --> 1:17:57.805
for five whole minutes
at the crime scene?

1:17:57.807 --> 1:17:59.674
Wouldn't they run away
immediately?

1:17:59.676 --> 1:18:02.677
- Mr. Styles, I'm
a professional psychologist.

1:18:02.679 --> 1:18:05.813
People do all kinds of things
for unexplained reasons.

1:18:05.815 --> 1:18:07.348
What is it that
you want me to do,

1:18:07.350 --> 1:18:10.351
provide an alibi for your son?

1:18:11.220 --> 1:18:13.320
- And how do you know
he was a drug pusher?

1:18:13.322 --> 1:18:16.791
- A friend of mine bought
from him, got screwed over.

1:18:16.793 --> 1:18:21.362
- So it's likely that Brian
had enemies, huh?

1:18:21.364 --> 1:18:24.231
- Objection.
This is all hearsay.

1:18:24.233 --> 1:18:26.534
How about we just stick
to the night in question?

1:18:26.535 --> 1:18:28.836
- Your Honor, can I get just
a little bit of leeway here?

1:18:28.838 --> 1:18:30.838
- I'll allow it for now.

1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:35.443
- Miss Swanson, you invited
Kholi to your party personally?

1:18:35.445 --> 1:18:37.978
- He seemed like a nice guy.

1:18:37.980 --> 1:18:41.449
- And how did he get along with
the other guests at the party?

1:18:41.451 --> 1:18:45.019
- He blended in just fine.
People seemed to like him.

1:18:45.021 --> 1:18:47.205
<i> - Now, he'd been drinking.</i>

1:18:47.206 --> 1:18:49.390
Did the intoxication
affect his temper?

1:18:49.392 --> 1:18:54.228
- No. He was a fun drunk,
not a mean drunk.

1:18:54.230 --> 1:18:57.198
- Now, were you ever at all
intimate with him that evening?

1:18:57.200 --> 1:18:58.983
- Objection, Your Honor.

1:18:58.984 --> 1:19:00.767
- Building to the
suspect's state of mind moments

1:19:00.770 --> 1:19:02.970
before the incident,
Your Honor.

1:19:02.972 --> 1:19:04.271
- What's that got
to do with this?

1:19:04.273 --> 1:19:06.173
- Mr. Canton?

1:19:06.175 --> 1:19:08.809
- Sorry, Judge. It's fine.
It's fine, Judge.

1:19:08.811 --> 1:19:13.314
He's just grasping at straws.
I say let him grasp.

1:19:13.316 --> 1:19:16.517
- Objection withdrawn.
- We kissed.

1:19:16.519 --> 1:19:18.285
- That's it?
- That's it.

1:19:18.287 --> 1:19:20.821
- He was respectful?
- Yes.

1:19:20.823 --> 1:19:22.990
- So you felt safe
in his company?

1:19:25.762 --> 1:19:28.395
- Yes, I did.

1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:32.500
- You're sure that's
the vehicle you saw leaving

1:19:32.502 --> 1:19:34.401
the scene
of the crime that night?

1:19:34.403 --> 1:19:38.005
- Yes, sir, that's the car.
- No more questions.

1:19:38.007 --> 1:19:42.810
- Uh-oh, it seems as though we
got ourselves a ghost car here.

1:19:43.980 --> 1:19:47.448
Stop me when I've said
something that isn't true.

1:19:47.450 --> 1:19:49.884
You don't know
who the car belongs to.

1:19:49.886 --> 1:19:53.387
You didn't bother to write
a license plate number down.

1:19:53.389 --> 1:19:55.923
And as far as you know,
this car could have

1:19:55.925 --> 1:19:57.925
just been passing
through the neighborhood.

1:19:57.927 --> 1:20:01.862
- No, I saw it was stopped.
Then it took off.

1:20:01.864 --> 1:20:03.464
- Uh-huh.

1:20:03.466 --> 1:20:07.001
Let me ask you, how thick
are those glasses, anyway?

1:20:07.003 --> 1:20:08.903
[laughter]

1:20:11.007 --> 1:20:12.863
- I can't stay here.

1:20:12.864 --> 1:20:14.720
<i> You think they</i>
<i> gonna give me life?</i>

1:20:14.721 --> 1:20:16.577
- Life, like all things,
is fleeting.

1:20:16.579 --> 1:20:19.847
Once you realize that life is
but a small drop in the glass

1:20:19.849 --> 1:20:22.283
of your whole existence,
the sooner you'll be at peace

1:20:22.285 --> 1:20:24.385
with the prospect
of letting go.

1:20:24.387 --> 1:20:28.355
You are a man of God.
I am a man of God.

1:20:28.357 --> 1:20:30.591
There are those
that are nonbelievers.

1:20:30.593 --> 1:20:35.095
What they do is they just keep
running towards a cliff

1:20:35.097 --> 1:20:36.497
when there's nothing up ahead.

1:20:36.499 --> 1:20:40.367
They're scared all the way,
but not us.

1:20:41.237 --> 1:20:43.571
We fall back on faith.

1:20:44.607 --> 1:20:47.074
Whether it comes today
or 50 years from now

1:20:47.076 --> 1:20:49.510
makes no difference.

1:20:49.512 --> 1:20:51.579
We're gonna keep on running.

1:20:51.581 --> 1:20:55.316
We're gonna stand
on this faith.

1:20:56.152 --> 1:21:02.256
Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1:21:02.258 --> 1:21:05.125
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on Earth

1:21:05.127 --> 1:21:07.361
as it is in heaven.

1:21:08.064 --> 1:21:11.432
Give us this day
our daily bread

1:21:11.434 --> 1:21:15.069
and forgive our trespasses,
as we forgive those who...

1:21:15.071 --> 1:21:17.137
both: Trespassed against us.

1:21:17.139 --> 1:21:21.542
Lead us not into temptation,
and deliver us from evil,

1:21:21.544 --> 1:21:26.180
for thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory.

1:21:26.182 --> 1:21:29.183
- In Jesus' precious name.

1:21:29.185 --> 1:21:32.887
<i> Our Father who art in heaven,</i>
<i> hallowed by thy name.</i>

1:21:32.889 --> 1:21:36.290
- I love you.
We're gonna get through this.

1:21:36.292 --> 1:21:38.025
Now, when we get in here,
you're gonna be

1:21:38.027 --> 1:21:40.294
under a microscope.
It's not what they know.

1:21:40.296 --> 1:21:42.663
It's what they can prove,
right?

1:21:42.665 --> 1:21:44.565
Now, every remark that is made,

1:21:44.567 --> 1:21:47.301
they're gonna be looking to you
for your reaction,

1:21:47.303 --> 1:21:50.004
and that's how they're gonna
make their call,

1:21:50.006 --> 1:21:54.308
so 25% is what they hear.

1:21:54.310 --> 1:21:58.312
75% is what they see,

1:21:58.314 --> 1:22:01.415
so let's make sure they see
the right thing, all right?

1:22:01.417 --> 1:22:04.518
Don't slouch.
You look good. You ready?

1:22:06.489 --> 1:22:08.455
- I love you.
- I love you too, son.

1:22:08.457 --> 1:22:10.958
- Mr. Styles, have you
any more witnesses?

1:22:12.161 --> 1:22:15.930
- I'd like to call to
the stand Kholi Styles.

1:22:28.544 --> 1:22:31.979
- Mr. Styles, please raise
your hand and repeat.

1:22:31.981 --> 1:22:34.014
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1:22:34.016 --> 1:22:36.717
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

1:22:37.453 --> 1:22:39.520

1:23:02.111 --> 1:23:04.278

1:23:19.228 --> 1:23:22.196
The defense rests.

<i> but for now so long.</i>

1:27:43.926 --> 1:27:45.593
- That's enough, Liz.

1:27:45.594 --> 1:27:47.261
- Can we just have one
conversation about this--

1:27:47.263 --> 1:27:48.528
- We've talked about it
20 times.

1:27:48.530 --> 1:27:50.030
- He seemed like a nice guy.

1:27:50.032 --> 1:27:52.432
- Did you feel safe around
Kholi

1:27:52.434 --> 1:27:54.468
after what had transpired?

1:27:54.470 --> 1:27:57.404
- No. I didn't.

1:27:57.406 --> 1:27:59.806
Nobody can say
he didn't have it coming.

1:27:59.808 --> 1:28:01.942
He pissed off a lot of people,

1:28:01.944 --> 1:28:04.011
<i> but he was good to me,</i>
<i> and I loved him.</i>

1:28:04.013 --> 1:28:08.048
- I have been shocked
at the rush to judgment

1:28:08.050 --> 1:28:11.551
that has been going on
all along the way.

1:28:11.553 --> 1:28:13.754
I'm gonna quote my mother

1:28:13.755 --> 1:28:15.956
and just say shame,
shame, shame.

1:28:15.958 --> 1:28:18.275
<i> There's plenty of blame</i>
<i> to go around.</i>

1:28:18.276 --> 1:28:20.593
<i> Those who were wagging</i>
<i> their fingers, pointing them,</i>

1:28:20.596 --> 1:28:23.430
<i> those who did not lend a hand,</i>

1:28:23.432 --> 1:28:26.066
who were too slow
to solve the problem.

1:28:27.436 --> 1:28:29.814
Lord help us all.

1:28:29.815 --> 1:28:32.193
<i> - When Kholi got arrested,</i>
<i> I tried to convince myself</i>

1:28:32.194 --> 1:28:34.572
<i> I didn't care.</i>
<i> I had to do what I had to do.</i>

1:28:39.315 --> 1:28:42.316
- Good morning to the people
of the city of Chicago.

1:28:42.318 --> 1:28:45.952
It is so wonderful to see
so many of you here

1:28:45.954 --> 1:28:48.588
celebrating the life
of this young man.

1:28:48.590 --> 1:28:52.426
Yes, that is what I said.
That's right. I said celebrate.

1:28:52.795 --> 1:28:54.461
I mean, to the naked eye,
it is a tragedy

1:28:54.463 --> 1:28:58.732
that this young man's life
be cut so short,

1:28:58.734 --> 1:29:01.501
but we're here
with soulful eyes,

1:29:01.503 --> 1:29:03.570
and soulful eyes see
that this young man

1:29:03.572 --> 1:29:05.472
has gone to be with the Lord.

1:29:05.474 --> 1:29:10.477
- Thanks for the ride anyway.
It was enlightening.

1:29:10.479 --> 1:29:12.779
- Anytime you want to talk.
- I mean, just think.

1:29:12.781 --> 1:29:15.749
I mean, we can only speculate

1:29:15.751 --> 1:29:18.452
what the face of Jesus
looks like.

1:29:25.427 --> 1:29:27.761
- I need to talk to you
face to face.

1:29:27.763 --> 1:29:29.096
- Do I have to?

1:29:29.098 --> 1:29:31.898
- I'm already here. Please?

1:29:35.571 --> 1:29:37.037
- I got a killer hangover,

1:29:37.039 --> 1:29:38.756
and on top of that
you're gonna yell at me,

1:29:38.757 --> 1:29:40.474
so can we please
just do this some other time?

1:29:40.476 --> 1:29:43.577
- I love you so much, Brian.
- You already know

1:29:43.579 --> 1:29:45.145
I'm going to college next year.

1:29:45.147 --> 1:29:46.780
Liz, I got a scholarship
at State.

1:29:46.782 --> 1:29:49.015
I don't need this on my mind.

1:29:50.953 --> 1:29:52.919
- Then I'll take care
of it myself.

1:29:52.921 --> 1:29:54.654
- No, you won't.

1:29:54.656 --> 1:29:56.523
You don't do anything
for yourself.

1:29:56.525 --> 1:29:58.100
<i> You'll take care of it</i>
<i> for a few weeks,</i>

1:29:58.101 --> 1:29:59.676
<i> and then you'll come knocking</i>
<i> at my door,</i>

1:29:59.677 --> 1:30:01.252
<i> and that's not fair to me</i>

1:30:01.253 --> 1:30:02.828
because
I never asked to have a kid!

1:30:02.831 --> 1:30:04.398
- You don't want me?

1:30:04.400 --> 1:30:07.100
- Please just--
just get rid of the baby.

1:30:07.102 --> 1:30:09.603
- Oh, he forgot his wallet.

1:30:11.006 --> 1:30:12.506
<i> - Liz, I have a life to start.</i>

1:30:12.507 --> 1:30:14.007
Now, you can come along
if you want,

1:30:14.009 --> 1:30:16.910
but if not, that's on you.

1:30:16.912 --> 1:30:21.415
I'm tired, and I'm hungover.
I'm going to bed.

1:30:22.785 --> 1:30:24.618
Bye, Liz.

1:30:24.620 --> 1:30:26.653
- I'm gonna drop this
off real quick.

1:30:26.655 --> 1:30:29.489
- Well, make it quick.
I'm tired, bro. I'm beat.

1:30:39.568 --> 1:30:41.501
- Liz?

1:30:41.503 --> 1:30:44.538
- Brian? Brian?

1:30:44.539 --> 1:30:47.574
- Yo, dawg, seriously?
- Please don't do this.

1:30:49.978 --> 1:30:51.678
No, wait. Liz!

1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:53.613
[gunshot]

1:30:53.615 --> 1:30:55.148
- What do we look like
with this right here?

1:30:55.150 --> 1:30:56.983
This is not a good look, fam.
We got to go.

1:30:56.985 --> 1:30:58.585
- No, man, we can't
just leave him.

1:30:58.586 --> 1:31:00.186
- Oh, man,
what you talking about, man?

1:31:00.187 --> 1:31:01.787
Think about it, right?
I've seen this [inaudible].

1:31:01.790 --> 1:31:03.590
Kholi, man, let's go.

1:31:03.592 --> 1:31:06.226
- You know I ain't clean, man.
This all they need, man.

1:31:06.228 --> 1:31:08.495
- Yo, Kholi, are you coming?
- Come on, man.

1:31:08.497 --> 1:31:09.863
We got to help him.

1:31:09.865 --> 1:31:10.864
- He's dead, Kholi.
Get in the car.

1:31:10.866 --> 1:31:12.622
- Kholi.

1:31:12.623 --> 1:31:14.379
<i> - I mean, look</i>
<i> at your neighbor.</i>

1:31:14.380 --> 1:31:16.136
- You writing your
own ticket, dawg.

1:31:16.138 --> 1:31:18.672
<i> - Our eyes are our shackles,</i>
<i> ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1:31:19.741 --> 1:31:22.031
- Help!

1:31:22.032 --> 1:31:24.322
<i> - It will only be on the day</i>

1:31:24.323 --> 1:31:26.613
<i> that we can look at each other</i>
<i> and see the Lord...</i>

1:31:27.149 --> 1:31:29.616
- Brian?
<i> - That we will be free.</i>

1:31:32.754 --> 1:31:35.088
- Mr. Styles, Mr. Styles.
- No major head injury,

1:31:35.090 --> 1:31:36.957
but he had a collapsed lung.

1:31:36.958 --> 1:31:38.825
We had to insert a chest tube
in order to re-expand it.

1:31:38.827 --> 1:31:41.027
- Is he going into surgery?
- No, that'd make it worse.

1:31:41.029 --> 1:31:42.729
[all speaking at once]

1:31:42.731 --> 1:31:45.198
[overlapping shouting]

1:31:48.003 --> 1:31:50.170
- Back up! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

1:31:50.172 --> 1:31:52.539
[all speaking at once]

1:31:54.910 --> 1:31:56.676
- Make way, please.

1:31:59.915 --> 1:32:02.015
- Hey. Thank you for coming.

1:32:02.017 --> 1:32:06.887
- He's endured a lot of trauma.
It's still too soon to tell.

1:32:06.889 --> 1:32:08.822
I'm sorry.

1:32:15.230 --> 1:32:18.732
<i> - Good morning, Chicago.</i>
<i> Drown out the social media.</i>

1:32:18.734 --> 1:32:20.600
Turn off the television.

1:32:20.602 --> 1:32:25.105
Get into the silence, and
when you tap into that silence,

1:32:25.107 --> 1:32:27.891
listen to your own heartbeat.

1:32:27.892 --> 1:32:30.676
<i> - ¶ Help me to find</i>
<i> the right words to say ¶</i>

1:32:30.679 --> 1:32:32.913
- Listen to the times
where you needed someone

1:32:32.915 --> 1:32:35.749
to show you grace
and no one was there.

1:32:35.951 --> 1:32:37.884
<i> Be the change you want to see.</i>

1:32:37.886 --> 1:32:39.998
- Mr. Canton! Mr. Canton!

1:32:39.999 --> 1:32:42.111
<i> Anything to say about</i>
<i> the trial?</i>

1:32:42.112 --> 1:32:44.224
<i> - This is a day for mourning,</i>
<i> not a day for politics.</i>

1:32:44.226 --> 1:32:47.694
No more questions.
Please excuse us.

1:32:47.696 --> 1:32:50.230
- So please offer your eyes

1:32:50.232 --> 1:32:53.833
and ears to
our friend, Mr. Jackie Styles.

1:32:53.835 --> 1:32:56.870
<i> - ¶ I just want to fly with</i>
<i> healing stars ¶</i>

1:32:56.872 --> 1:33:00.674
<i> ¶ Too many battles,</i>
<i> no strength to fight ¶</i>

1:33:00.676 --> 1:33:02.976
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

1:33:02.978 --> 1:33:07.747
<i> - I stand here today having</i>
<i> been challenged as a father.</i>

1:33:07.749 --> 1:33:10.984
Such a young life was lost
in such cold fashion

1:33:10.986 --> 1:33:15.655
<i> because of the lack of warmth</i>
<i> in the hearts of humanity.</i>

1:33:16.658 --> 1:33:19.593
Some would say we live
in a fallen world,

1:33:19.595 --> 1:33:23.863
but as I stand here
and look out,

1:33:23.865 --> 1:33:28.868
I can't help but see hope
for a brighter day.

1:33:30.205 --> 1:33:36.209
He did that, and although
he lies sound asleep,

1:33:36.211 --> 1:33:38.378
<i> his voice is louder than ever,</i>

1:33:38.380 --> 1:33:42.983
strongly urging us
to fight our hate,

1:33:42.985 --> 1:33:46.886
<i> to live better than our</i>
<i> ancestors could have imagined.</i>

1:33:48.056 --> 1:33:53.059
To the Sudermills, to Brian,

1:33:53.061 --> 1:33:57.230
let us lift them up in prayer,

1:33:57.232 --> 1:34:00.400
and extend a hand towards them.

1:34:00.402 --> 1:34:04.671
To a young man who was loved
so much,

1:34:04.673 --> 1:34:06.840
we say goodnight.

1:34:06.842 --> 1:34:08.174
- Slide, I'ma let you slide.

1:34:08.176 --> 1:34:10.944
- We will see you
in the morning,

1:34:10.946 --> 1:34:15.248
and to the world, I stand here,
and I say good morning.

1:34:16.118 --> 1:34:18.652
We are just getting started.

1:34:21.189 --> 1:34:24.391
<i> - ¶ I know I'm broken ¶</i>

1:34:24.393 --> 1:34:27.227
<i> ¶ My heart has fallen so far ¶</i>

1:34:27.229 --> 1:34:31.131
<i> ¶ I need your love</i>
<i> to life me up ¶</i>

1:34:31.133 --> 1:34:33.199
<i> ¶ Hurrah ¶</i>

1:34:33.201 --> 1:34:36.403
<i> ¶ I know I'm broken ¶</i>

1:34:36.405 --> 1:34:38.905
<i> - Listen to your</i>
<i> own heartbeat.</i>

1:34:38.907 --> 1:34:40.940
<i> Listen to the times</i>
<i> where you needed someone</i>

1:34:40.942 --> 1:34:43.677
<i> to show you grace</i>
<i> and no one was there.</i>

1:34:47.115 --> 1:34:49.583
<i> And when you hear</i>
<i> that heartbeat,</i>

1:34:49.584 --> 1:34:52.052
<i> you'll see that the heartbeats</i>
<i> don't tell us whether or not</i>

1:34:52.054 --> 1:34:54.204
<i> we're innocent or guilty.</i>

1:34:54.205 --> 1:34:56.355
<i> It just says that</i>
<i> we're humans.</i>

1:34:58.226 --> 1:35:01.361
<i> And so I have a special</i>
<i> message for you, Kholi.</i>

1:35:01.363 --> 1:35:05.298
<i> I want you to know that</i>
<i> the cloud over your head today</i>

1:35:05.300 --> 1:35:08.301
<i> will be the water</i>
<i> you drink from tomorrow.</i>

1:35:08.970 --> 1:35:11.237
- I love you.

1:35:11.239 --> 1:35:13.306
We're gonna get through this.

1:35:13.307 --> 1:35:15.374
<i> - ¶ My heart has fallen</i>
<i> so far ¶</i>

1:35:15.377 --> 1:35:19.212
<i> ¶ I need your love</i>
<i> to lift me up ¶</i>

1:35:19.214 --> 1:35:22.148
<i> ¶ High, lift me up ¶</i>

1:35:22.150 --> 1:35:25.985
<i> ¶ Love lifts me up ¶</i>

1:35:25.987 --> 1:35:29.022
<i> ¶ Love lifts me up ¶</i>

1:35:29.024 --> 1:35:31.925
<i> ¶ Love lifts me up ¶</i>

1:35:31.927 --> 1:35:33.927
<i> ¶ High ¶</i>

1:35:39.501 --> 1:35:42.335
- I'm Holland.
- I'm Bree.

1:35:42.337 --> 1:35:43.937
- And today we're
at Soundscape...

1:35:43.939 --> 1:35:45.105
both: Studios.

1:35:45.107 --> 1:35:47.006
- In Chicago.
- Yeah.

1:35:47.876 --> 1:35:50.477
- ¶ Ain't nothing to it
but to do it ¶

1:35:50.479 --> 1:35:53.413
¶ That slow motion
got you dragging ¶

1:35:53.415 --> 1:35:56.282
¶ Now you can take the time,
just do it ¶

1:35:56.284 --> 1:35:58.351
¶ Do it, do it, do it ¶

1:35:58.353 --> 1:36:00.787
- We have X equals 24.

1:36:00.789 --> 1:36:02.889
Then what does that
give us for Y?

1:36:03.391 --> 1:36:05.158
- Oh, Ms. Deese, 33.

1:36:05.160 --> 1:36:08.795
- Of course, Paulina, 33.
Very good.

1:36:11.299 --> 1:36:13.533
Anyone? Ah, Kholi?

1:36:13.535 --> 1:36:16.436
- 42 squared, Ms. Deese.
- Very good.

1:36:17.372 --> 1:36:19.839
- Welcome to Friendly Hills
High School, Kholi.

1:36:19.841 --> 1:36:21.141
Well, tell you what.

1:36:21.143 --> 1:36:23.126
Just have a seat
right over there.

1:36:23.127 --> 1:36:25.110
- ¶ Put my trust in God
for a breakthrough ¶

1:36:25.113 --> 1:36:27.881
¶ You could try if you want to,
it ain't... ¶

1:36:27.883 --> 1:36:29.849
- What is the first thing
America thinks of

1:36:29.851 --> 1:36:31.951
when they hear
the word "minority?"

1:36:31.953 --> 1:36:33.987
- Professional sports.

1:36:33.988 --> 1:36:36.022
Cable channels
from the number 200 and up.

1:36:36.024 --> 1:36:37.257
The people who wash our cars.

1:36:37.259 --> 1:36:38.925
Ticket, ticket, ticket.

1:36:40.562 --> 1:36:42.462
- That's why some folks
in Winnetka

1:36:42.464 --> 1:36:44.464
are trying to keep an eye
on Kholi Styles.

1:36:44.466 --> 1:36:47.000
Why? Because racism is taught.

1:36:47.002 --> 1:36:50.370
- ¶ Just do it.
Do it, do it, do it ¶

1:36:50.372 --> 1:36:53.139
¶ Head up, you can do it,
so what if you blew it? ¶

1:36:53.141 --> 1:36:55.441
- Every kid that gets killed is
the next great superstar

1:36:55.443 --> 1:36:57.477
or the ne--the greatest guy
ever as soon as they die.

1:36:57.478 --> 1:36:59.512
<i> Nobody cares about these kids</i>
<i> until they're dead.</i>

1:36:59.514 --> 1:37:03.082
- ¶ You can do it,
do it ¶

1:37:03.451 --> 1:37:07.353
¶ When you're stuck
in yesterday ¶

1:37:07.355 --> 1:37:09.823
- We have to be willing
to get up to the plate,

1:37:09.825 --> 1:37:12.892
stand up to the lecterns,
get to the microphones

1:37:12.894 --> 1:37:16.462
and speak about the issue.
We're afraid to talk.

1:37:16.464 --> 1:37:18.431
- ¶ Then I'm
lift you up ¶

1:37:18.433 --> 1:37:21.167
¶ When you feel like
it looks run out ¶

1:37:21.169 --> 1:37:23.503
¶ Let them fill

1:37:23.505 --> 1:37:25.305
¶ So the change
gonna come ¶

1:37:25.307 --> 1:37:27.974
- And I really want to
challenge you guys as

1:37:27.976 --> 1:37:31.411
brown and black people
to really think about the words

1:37:31.413 --> 1:37:32.946
and the messages
you put out there.

1:37:32.948 --> 1:37:35.548
- ¶ Just do it.
Do it, do it, do it ¶

1:37:35.550 --> 1:37:37.283
¶ Head up,
you can do it ¶

1:37:37.285 --> 1:37:39.986
¶ So what if you blew it? ¶
[inaudible]

1:37:39.988 --> 1:37:43.156
- What is the deal
with America and race?

1:37:43.859 --> 1:37:47.393
- ¶ You can do it, do it ¶

1:37:47.395 --> 1:37:51.297
- Even when you feel--
oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

1:37:51.299 --> 1:37:53.233
I'm drooling.

1:37:53.235 --> 1:37:55.001
- Action.

1:37:57.639 --> 1:37:59.138
[laughter]

1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:01.007
Not quite that slow.

1:38:01.008 --> 1:38:02.875
- This is a serious
movie, okay?

1:38:02.878 --> 1:38:04.277
- Cut.

1:38:04.279 --> 1:38:05.979
- You are crazy.

1:38:08.350 --> 1:38:10.283
- For us to change
America,

1:38:10.285 --> 1:38:13.653
we have to get
uncomfortable.

1:38:13.655 --> 1:38:15.889
It doesn't mean
we have to be unkind.

1:38:15.891 --> 1:38:18.024
It doesn't mean we have
to put each other down,

1:38:18.026 --> 1:38:20.994
but what it does mean is that
in order for the root

1:38:20.996 --> 1:38:25.331
of this country to be healed,
we got to get uncomfortable

1:38:25.333 --> 1:38:28.067
<i> so that we can</i>
<i> address the pain.</i>

1:38:31.473 --> 1:38:33.490
<i> - Philippians tells us that</i>
<i> we can be all...</i>

1:38:33.491 --> 1:38:35.508
<i>- What's privilege mean to you,</i>
<i> Al Roker, Jr.?</i>

1:38:35.510 --> 1:38:38.912
- Privilege is getting
something that you didn't earn.

1:38:38.914 --> 1:38:41.147
- So you have an advantage
being a hot woman.

1:38:41.149 --> 1:38:42.916
Like, you get out of tickets.

1:38:42.918 --> 1:38:44.450
- I don't recall you doing--
[phone ringing]

1:38:44.452 --> 1:38:47.153
- [laughs] Go and answer that,
bro. Let me--

1:38:47.155 --> 1:38:50.189
- Yeah, yeah. What's up?
What's up? It's Ron's Place.

1:38:50.191 --> 1:38:51.691
- We would lie.
- Cut.

1:38:51.693 --> 1:38:53.059
- We wouldn't lie.

1:38:53.061 --> 1:38:55.495
- I'ma follow you.
- Oh.

1:38:56.932 --> 1:38:58.364
- Of course.

1:38:58.366 --> 1:39:01.000
- Did you ever see
"My Cousin Vinny," the movie?

1:39:01.002 --> 1:39:02.936
Wasn't Daniel-san
from "The Karate Kid"

1:39:02.938 --> 1:39:04.470
movie guilty in
the beginning?

1:39:04.472 --> 1:39:06.072
And then at the end
you realize

1:39:06.073 --> 1:39:07.673
there was no chance
he committed the murders.

1:39:07.676 --> 1:39:10.043
- How do you bring in--
how do you bring

1:39:10.045 --> 1:39:11.611
Ralph Macchio movies

1:39:11.612 --> 1:39:13.178
and relate it to this Brian
Sudermill being killed? I--

1:39:13.181 --> 1:39:14.414
- Everyone thought
he was guilty.

1:39:14.416 --> 1:39:15.715
- It's a stretch. So--

1:39:15.717 --> 1:39:17.216
- And at the end
everyone realized

1:39:17.218 --> 1:39:18.401
there's no chance
he's guilty.

1:39:18.402 --> 1:39:19.585
- So the Cousin Vinny
defense

1:39:19.587 --> 1:39:20.954
is what we're gonna
use for this?

1:39:20.956 --> 1:39:22.522
- Yes!

1:39:22.524 --> 1:39:25.058
- ¶ In the name of Jesus ¶

1:39:25.060 --> 1:39:29.095
¶ To break every chain,
break every chain ¶

1:39:29.097 --> 1:39:31.030
<i>¶ ¶</i>

1:39:31.032 --> 1:39:36.369
- ¶ There is power in
the name of Jesus ¶

1:39:36.371 --> 1:39:42.175
Say it again. ¶ There is
power in the name of Jesus. ¶

1:39:43.578 --> 1:39:48.147
all: ¶ There is power
in the name of Jesus ¶

1:39:48.149 --> 1:39:51.551
To do what? ¶ To break every
chain, break every chain ¶

1:39:51.553 --> 1:39:53.987
- We don't sell news,
[inaudible].

1:39:53.989 --> 1:39:56.155
"The Mexicans are coming
for our jobs.

1:39:56.157 --> 1:39:57.490
"Put up those walls.

1:39:57.492 --> 1:39:59.258
Oh, the blacks are
coming for our lives."

1:39:59.260 --> 1:40:01.311
Hell, they're coming
for our daughters.

1:40:01.312 --> 1:40:03.363
Head for the border!
<i>Orale, </i> I love America!

1:40:03.365 --> 1:40:05.631
I love Mexicans,
hoo-ah!"

1:40:05.633 --> 1:40:07.600
Let me do that again.
Can we do that again?

1:40:07.602 --> 1:40:13.139
- ¶ There is power in the name
of Jesus to break every ¶

1:40:13.141 --> 1:40:18.077
¶ To break every chain,
uh-huh, break every chain ¶

1:40:18.079 --> 1:40:24.317
But we not done. Turn it up.
¶ There's an army rising up ¶

1:40:24.319 --> 1:40:29.622
¶ There's an army,
there's an army rising up ¶

1:40:29.624 --> 1:40:33.026
¶ We taking our stand.
There's an army ¶

1:40:33.028 --> 1:40:37.130
¶ There's an army rising up
to break every chain ¶

1:40:37.132 --> 1:40:42.635
¶ To break every chain,
break every chain. Oh ¶

1:40:42.637 --> 1:40:45.138
- Whether it's your
revelation,

1:40:45.139 --> 1:40:47.640
you can't lead people
to see the love of God.

1:40:47.642 --> 1:40:51.177
I myself have been guilty
of being hateful

1:40:51.179 --> 1:40:54.814
and prideful in my
revelation of God's word.

1:40:54.816 --> 1:40:57.683
- ¶ There's an army
rising up ¶

1:40:57.685 --> 1:40:59.752
- Five people
come to church,

1:40:59.754 --> 1:41:01.721
and then three of those
people come extra

1:41:01.723 --> 1:41:03.239
because they
feel guilty.

1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:04.756
Would you rather them
just not come at all?

1:41:04.759 --> 1:41:06.325
- I'd rather them
not come at all.

1:41:06.327 --> 1:41:07.643
I want them to--
I want them to--

1:41:07.644 --> 1:41:08.960
- No, I want them
to come

1:41:08.961 --> 1:41:10.277
because I want them
to hear that word.

1:41:10.278 --> 1:41:11.594
Even if they hear a
little bit or all of it,

1:41:11.599 --> 1:41:15.468
but at least they're in there
for whatever reason.

1:41:15.470 --> 1:41:18.071
- ¶ Just to break
every chain ¶

1:41:18.073 --> 1:41:20.206
- In everybody's life
we're gonna be confronted

1:41:20.208 --> 1:41:23.342
with the reality of how is
your faith gonna play out

1:41:23.344 --> 1:41:26.028
in real-life
situations?

1:41:26.029 --> 1:41:28.713
- ¶ There is power in
the name of Jesus ¶

1:41:28.716 --> 1:41:30.817
- Your responsibility
as influencers,

1:41:30.819 --> 1:41:34.520
you guys all took
responsibility for it,

1:41:34.522 --> 1:41:36.389
and not one person
said,

1:41:36.391 --> 1:41:39.459
"Hey, this is their mama's
and daddy's responsibility

1:41:39.461 --> 1:41:41.878
to pour something
into them."

1:41:41.879 --> 1:41:44.296
Do you see yourself as
the answer or just a part of?

1:41:44.299 --> 1:41:46.599
- Nowadays a fan
could hit us up,

1:41:46.601 --> 1:41:48.968
and we could talk
directly to them,

1:41:48.969 --> 1:41:51.336
and they look at us just as big
as the news out of Washington

1:41:51.339 --> 1:41:54.490
or whatever, you know?

1:41:54.491 --> 1:41:57.642
- ¶ Falling, falling, falling
in Jesus' name, falling ¶

1:41:57.645 --> 1:42:00.246
¶ I hear the chains falling ¶

1:42:00.248 --> 1:42:02.148
- I have to be responsible
for these people

1:42:02.150 --> 1:42:04.183
because I've had thousands
and thousands of people

1:42:04.185 --> 1:42:05.818
tell me how their lives
have been changed

1:42:05.820 --> 1:42:08.387
because of the things
I've done for them.

1:42:08.389 --> 1:42:12.325
- ¶ I hear the chains falling,
I hear the chains falling ¶

1:42:12.327 --> 1:42:13.793
- There was a lot of stuff
that the prosecution

1:42:13.795 --> 1:42:15.261
didn't take a look at.

1:42:15.263 --> 1:42:16.796
- That's right.

1:42:16.797 --> 1:42:18.330
- Yeah, so--but I mean,
but my thing is this though.

1:42:18.331 --> 1:42:19.864
If--now, Kholi was
returning his wallet.

1:42:19.868 --> 1:42:21.534
- Hold it, stop. You know what?

1:42:21.536 --> 1:42:23.169
You better get me
with his--you--

1:42:23.171 --> 1:42:25.271
how you gonna agree
with him and me,

1:42:25.273 --> 1:42:28.374
and we just [inaudible]?
What is wrong with you, man?

1:42:28.376 --> 1:42:30.209
All right, we'll pick--
we'll pick it up again.

1:42:30.211 --> 1:42:31.811
- ¶ They falling, they falling,
they falling ¶

1:42:31.813 --> 1:42:33.880
¶ They falling, they falling,
they falling ¶

1:42:33.882 --> 1:42:36.916
¶ They falling, they falling,
they falling ¶

1:42:36.918 --> 1:42:41.154
¶ They falling. They falling,
they falling, they falling ¶

1:42:42.257 --> 1:42:44.457
¶ They falling, they falling,
they falling ¶

1:42:44.458 --> 1:42:46.658
¶ They falling, they falling,
they falling ¶

1:42:46.661 --> 1:42:49.529
<i> Give us the power....</i>

1:42:49.531 --> 1:42:52.198
<i> in the name of Jesus.</i>

1:42:53.835 --> 1:42:56.302
¶ So much power in the name--

1:42:56.304 --> 1:43:01.774
[overlapping chatter]

1:43:01.776 --> 1:43:04.710
- Hector's playing music
on this now.
