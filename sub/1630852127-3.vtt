BOTH: (SING)
# It's because I love you

00:20.200 --> 00:22.640
# Not because we're far apart... #

00:22.680 --> 00:24.200
Grace...
OK. OK.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.080
I'm good. I'm doing it good.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.400
OK.

# Do what you wanna do
Be what you wanna be, yeah

00:38.320 --> 00:40.160
# Oooh-oooh... #

00:40.200 --> 00:41.240
Keep going.

00:41.280 --> 00:44.960
# Do what you wanna do
Be what you wanna be, yeah... #

00:45.000 --> 00:46.840
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:46.880 --> 00:50.240
I'm sorry. I've never been asked
to do this before. I'm sorry.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.480
Do you think it's working?
Can you feel the baby moving?

00:52.520 --> 00:56.440
Not yet.
Oh, I wonder why. (LAUGHS)

00:56.480 --> 00:59.280
Kaya87 suggested this on my thread.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.840
She said her baby was overdue
and this helped spark the labour.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.400
The cold up here makes the baby
want to get away

01:05.440 --> 01:07.800
and the singing lets the baby know
it's safe to be born.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.760
Well, your signs are good
and you are definitely full-term,

01:11.800 --> 01:14.000
so, one way or another,
it won't be too much longer.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.200
Yeah. Keep your phone handy.
Yes, I will.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.720
Oh, no... Hey, don't get up.
Oh, thanks.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.840
See you.
See you.

(EXHALES)

01:25.480 --> 01:28.480
(THEME MUSIC)

01:36.480 --> 01:38.640
Does singing actually help move
the baby?

01:38.680 --> 01:42.080
(LAUGHS) What, like, hard evidence?
Yeah.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.240
Well, I've never read a study,
I'll put it that way.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.960
It's the internet.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.640
And, hey, it's her body.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.040
(MOBILE PHONE RINGS)

01:52.080 --> 01:53.160
Hello?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.280
MAN: I thought we had
an understanding.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.320
Who's this?
It's Kirk.

01:58.360 --> 02:01.240
When were you going to tell me about
this counselling session today?

02:01.280 --> 02:02.760
What counselling session?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.360
Sophia said that you knew.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.400
Well, I don't.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.520
The adoption counselling.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.400
Today?

02:11.440 --> 02:13.560
(SIGHS) Why is she lying to me
about this?

02:13.600 --> 02:16.800
Oh, gee, I don't know. I've never
heard of a teenager lying before.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.400
We're running out of time
to change her mind.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.200
You want to be there?
Yeah.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.520
OK, well, I want to be there too.
Can you make it?

02:24.560 --> 02:25.680
Yeah.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.600
Alright. Well, you find out
the details and I'll meet you there.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.200
OK.
(HANGS UP)

02:35.120 --> 02:37.720
I don't want to talk about it.
Yeah.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.360
This is a nice place.
I know.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.440
This is Lily.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.720
Hi!
Oh, sorry! I forgot our appointment.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.000
Ross is at work.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.320
His, um...his company got taken over
by the Americans.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.360
I don't know you.
Oh, this is Max.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.160
Oh, hug for you too.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.560
The babysitter got gastro.
I'm so sorry.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.120
Oh, no...
The place is an absolute mess.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.440
I'm gonna get you!
Guys, settle down!

03:01.480 --> 03:02.520
Are you OK?

03:02.560 --> 03:04.280
Oh, god, I'm just...
Tip!

03:04.320 --> 03:06.000
Oh, gosh, nothing bad.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.680
Guys...

03:07.720 --> 03:09.000
Oh, god, I'm just exhausted.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.600
I just want a shower.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.600
Oh... We can arrange that.
Come on.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.320
Thanks. Oh...

03:30.520 --> 03:31.920
Alright. You're good.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.120
(EXHALES)
Why is the cannula hurting?

03:37.160 --> 03:39.480
Is it dislodged?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.760
It looks fine.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.760
Maybe you could flush it.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.160
Oh, is it too much trouble?

03:45.200 --> 03:46.680
Not at all.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.640
What happens if I need to go
to the loo?

03:48.680 --> 03:51.800
You still can.
Oh, my back!

03:51.840 --> 03:54.600
Why does it hurt like this?
Which side is worse?

03:54.640 --> 03:55.640
Both sides.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.720
My back! Oooh!
It's working perfectly, by the way.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.920

03:59.960 --> 04:01.880
Oh, I need to push!

04:01.920 --> 04:04.320
OK.
(YOWLS)

04:06.720 --> 04:09.680
Are you two married?
(LAUGHS) No.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.960
Boyfriend-girlfriend?
Uh, no, no, no, no.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.600
No, we just work together.
Have you had a baby?

04:15.640 --> 04:18.640
Yes. A little girl.
Where is she?

04:18.680 --> 04:20.920
Well, uh, she's not a baby anymore.

04:20.960 --> 04:24.320
Yeah. In fact,
she has had her own baby.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.800
KIDS: Whoa!
Yeah.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.400
Does that make you a grandma?

04:28.440 --> 04:31.440
Uh... Do I look old enough
to be a grandma?

04:31.480 --> 04:32.720
Yes!
(LAUGHS)

04:32.760 --> 04:34.600
You walked into that one, Grandma.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.840
If our baby's a girl,
we're gonna name her Elsa.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.200
Oh. Are you sure about that?

04:39.240 --> 04:42.800
If our baby's a boy, we're gonna
call him Garbage Poo Head.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.040
(LAUGHS)
Garbage Poo Head?

04:45.080 --> 04:47.160
Yeah, no, hang on. Now, hold on.
That's a rude name.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.320
I don't like that name
terribly much. (LAUGHS)

04:49.360 --> 04:53.440
Thank you. I feel
so much more human now. (LAUGHS)

04:53.480 --> 04:56.160
Well, your blood pressure is OK

04:56.200 --> 04:58.800
but it is nudging towards
being a little bit high.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.480
Yeah, that's probably 'cause it's
been a stressful couple of days.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.960
You know, the kids are really
excited about the new baby,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
which is great, but...

05:07.040 --> 05:08.880
Argh!
(LAUGHS)

05:08.920 --> 05:10.320
I get it.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.400
Well, Max and I are gonna do our best

05:12.440 --> 05:14.440
to give you the homebirth
that you all want.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.080
But I do want to prepare you.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.440
We might get to a point
where we need to reassess.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.440
Just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.240
I don't want to do anything
that puts the baby at risk.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.680
Or myself.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.440
I mean, this whole caper falls apart
without me. (LAUGHS)

05:28.880 --> 05:31.920
Using an exercise ball
regularly in pregnancy

05:31.960 --> 05:34.080
will reduce back and hip pain.

05:34.120 --> 05:37.240
And then, closer to birth, it'll
assist in opening up your pelvis.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.960
Oh... Is that a knee?
Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.800
This baby!

05:40.840 --> 05:42.560
Oh, sorry, um,

05:42.600 --> 05:45.640
the movements definitely
haven't slowed down at all yet.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.280
When is that meant to happen?

05:47.320 --> 05:48.600
Oh, that's an old wives' tale.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.920
Babies will keep moving
right up until they're born.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.480
Sign of a healthy baby.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.200
I see we have a new face
in the class. Welcome.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.800
Thank you.
I'm Laney.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.160
I know.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.560
My husband couldn't be here today
but he works at the hospital.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.800
Oh, you're part of
the St Brigid's family!

06:02.840 --> 06:07.720
Yes. I'm Christina.
My husband is Paul Hobson.

06:11.720 --> 06:17.120
Paul's wife,
right there in my class. Pregnant.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.960
GRACE: Oh, no.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.800
32 weeks.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.200
Great!

06:25.720 --> 06:27.640
Is anyone finding
that they have, um,

06:27.680 --> 06:30.840
more energy
than in the first trimester?

06:30.880 --> 06:34.040
(TOILET FLUSHES, DOOR OPENS)

06:38.640 --> 06:40.240
Do you think she knows it's you?

06:40.280 --> 06:42.480
I'm sure she knows, OK?

06:42.520 --> 06:44.320
She knows her husband's
being unfaithful

06:44.360 --> 06:46.520
and she's put it all together
and she knows it's me.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.440
Question.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.600
Of course.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.680
I'm vegetarian

06:55.720 --> 06:59.160
and I was wondering about whether
I need to take a B12 supplement.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.960
Um, have you had a blood test?
Yes. I'm waiting for the results.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.640
Oh, I could find out for you.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.520
Thank you.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.840
Oh, man. What are you gonna do?

07:14.880 --> 07:18.240
Well, everything's been great.
It... It's been clean.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.520
No-one's been getting hurt.
(WATER RUNS)

07:19.560 --> 07:21.440
But now...
(WATER STOPS RUNNING)

07:23.040 --> 07:29.040
I'm just standing there and...
and I'm...concerned for her.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.440
Thanks for the class.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.760
Her marriage is in trouble
and I'm the cause of that.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.960
(ON VOICEMAIL)
You've reached Paul Hobson.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.720
Best way to contact me
is text or email

07:43.760 --> 07:47.000
but if you need to, leave a message.
(BEEP)

07:47.040 --> 07:50.400
(PANTS)

07:50.440 --> 07:53.480
So I thought I'd go tell Paul
what I thought of him and...

07:53.520 --> 07:55.520
Who do you think
just came to my prenatal class?

07:55.560 --> 07:57.960
Laney, hello...
Christina. Your wife.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.040
And, uh,
that was a bit of a surprise.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.640
Sorry about this.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.720
Congratulations!

08:05.760 --> 08:07.560
I didn't know she was pregnant.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.840
Thank you.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.600
I apologise.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.480
Well, I stuffed that up too.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.000
Permission to speak freely?

08:17.040 --> 08:18.320
Granted.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.320
An affair, by definition, doomed.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.840
And isn't that why you got into this
relationship in the first place,

08:23.880 --> 08:25.280
because you knew it couldn't last?

08:26.720 --> 08:28.160
I thought it could.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.760
I thought it could be simple.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.000
I need help.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.680
No more pushing for now, OK?
You're OK.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.480
5cm.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.560
Just rest now, OK?

08:45.600 --> 08:47.760
Rest as much as you can.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.480
Were you having a strong urge
to push?

08:50.520 --> 08:52.960
No. I never want to push again.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.760
It's like...
It's like pushing down a wall.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.160
She said she wanted to push.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.280
Ohhh...
Where does it hurt?

09:02.320 --> 09:03.800
My back.
OK. Alright.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.640
Let's turn you over onto your side
and we'll get you some gas.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.280
(MOANS)
That's the way.

09:08.320 --> 09:11.120
Just into spasm here.
I'll work on it.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.000
Big, long, deep breaths.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.080
Big breath out.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.200
Better?

09:18.240 --> 09:19.920
Good stuff, huh?

09:24.720 --> 09:26.760
So, Beatrice is only dilated 5cm.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.760
You've been coaching her to push?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.440
She was dilated 10cm.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.000
I was sure it was ten.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.560
And she wanted to push.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.920
And you've had her pushing
for an hour?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.040
This is my fault.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.640
(HALF-LAUGHS)
Say that a different way.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.720
I made a mistake.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.560
And we've all made it.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.480
And what should you have done?

09:49.520 --> 09:52.960
I should have checked dilation again

09:53.000 --> 09:55.440
and paid more attention
to her progress.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.880
Maybe you should go have a breather.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.560
Yeah.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.880
(SIGHS)
Is she OK in there?

10:03.920 --> 10:05.480
She's spooked.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.200
I think to reassure her
I'll get an obstetrician to stop by,

10:08.240 --> 10:09.280
if there's one.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.880
There's one.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.640
There's two, in fact.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.960
Oh.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.640
This is the midwives'
part of the shop,

10:17.680 --> 10:19.480
which means, strictly speaking,

10:19.520 --> 10:21.240
we don't come here
without an invitation

10:21.280 --> 10:23.640
but if there's a consultation,
we then...

10:23.680 --> 10:24.840
I understand.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.120
So, dinner tonight?

10:28.280 --> 10:29.960
Sure.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.400
Why not?

10:31.440 --> 10:34.120
Dr Sebastian?
Yes.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.600
Hi. Are you consulting today?

10:35.640 --> 10:37.040
Uh, yeah, I'm on call today.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.840
Would you mind? Um, I have a woman
we'd like to ask you about.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.520
Go.
Of course.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.920
Thank you.

10:48.520 --> 10:49.880
What are you doing here?

10:49.920 --> 10:51.640
Showing the doctor around.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.160
What are you really doing here?

10:53.200 --> 10:55.560
I am head of obstetrics.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.800
But since we're here, a little
family update would be rather nice.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.560
I think you're screening my calls.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.920
Yeah, because it's delicate.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.280
The last thing anyone needs is...
Just a little scrap.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.320
A tiny shred of information?

11:07.520 --> 11:10.120
There's a session today
with the adoption counsellor.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.400
Uh-huh.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.840
This is why I screen you...
Did I speak?

11:15.880 --> 11:21.320
Mum, I have no influence.
I cannot push anything.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.880
I'm hanging onto this relationship
with my pinkie finger.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.280
Oh, welcome to my world.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.240
(SIGHS) Shut up, Diane.
(LAUGHS)

11:35.520 --> 11:37.560
Yeah, it looks like
it was that muscle

11:37.600 --> 11:39.000
that was causing you the pain.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.680
The massage helped. Thank you.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.200
Your baby is fine.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.120
Now, have you talked
about pain relief?

11:44.160 --> 11:46.000
I don't want an epidural.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.440
I'd rather not. Yet.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.040
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.040
So, what do you think
moving forward for Beatrice?

11:53.080 --> 11:55.600
Well, she's exhausted and dehydrated.
I recommend oral fluid.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.680
But if not, maybe we can talk about
an IV.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.800
And if she decides on an epidural,
we'll call for one.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.720
Well, I'm here if you need me.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.320
I need to run away for a bit.
Yeah?

12:05.360 --> 12:07.280
Can you cover me for, like, an hour?
What for?

12:07.320 --> 12:09.280
Adoption counselling.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.440
Sophia's...
Yeah. OK.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.240
Thank you.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.960
Your hair smells like apples.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.600
SOPHIA: You know I was fine
to come on my own.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.640
Yeah, 'cause I'm the worst dad ever.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.040
I'm late.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.440
Hi.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.720
Are you...

12:47.720 --> 12:51.080
I'm sure you know that before you
can give your child for adoption,

12:51.120 --> 12:52.520
there is a process

12:52.560 --> 12:54.840
and these counselling sessions
are part of that.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.800
I'm not here to force you to make
one decision or another.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.520
I will need to ask you questions,

13:01.560 --> 13:05.760
provocative ones, to help you to
understand the choice you're making.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.280
Yep.

13:09.280 --> 13:14.160
Can you tell me, in your own words,
why you're considering this?

13:14.200 --> 13:16.960
I don't want to raise a child.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.480
Tell me about what your life's like.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.080
Mum died just under two years ago.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.560
She had leukemia.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.800
It was fast.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.680
What's it been like since then?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.640
Hectic.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.440
After Mum, Dad got really down,

13:39.480 --> 13:41.160
didn't leave the house
for, like, months...

13:41.200 --> 13:42.280
I was fine.

13:44.680 --> 13:45.920
Yeah.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.000
That's other people.
I'm asking about you.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.200
I was doing Year 12
and I got pregnant.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.080
Now I've had a baby.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.200
I miss my mum.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.920
But that's life.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.360
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

14:04.400 --> 14:06.800
I'm sorry to bother you.
It's an urgent call.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.000
Category one.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.640
I'm gonna have to step out.
I'll be right back.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.680
(DOOR CLOSES)
Category one's the most urgent.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.360
Why won't you tell me
who the father is?

14:23.760 --> 14:25.960
Because he has nothing
to do with it.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.800
He doesn't have anything
to do with me.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.400
He doesn't have
anything to do with her.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.360
So, why do you care so much?
Because I do, Sophia.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.120
(SIGHS) Well, you've always told me

14:34.160 --> 14:35.760
that just because
someone gives birth to you,

14:35.800 --> 14:38.160
that doesn't mean
she's the best person to raise you.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.720
You've both said that.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.840
Did I?

14:43.480 --> 14:46.160
You said when you had me
your life was complicated.

14:46.200 --> 14:49.280
So, yeah, you weren't
the best person to raise me.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.320
Look, planned parenthood is a thing.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.640
So, yes, I can decide not to be
a parent right now in my life.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.000
You could have decided that
nine months ago.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.040
OK, maybe we should...

14:59.080 --> 15:02.160
What, so having an abortion's OK but
giving up a baby for adoption isn't?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.400
Really?
Can I say something?

15:04.440 --> 15:07.320
I have first-hand experience
of adoption...

15:07.360 --> 15:09.040
So do I.
So have I.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.720
I did what you're planning on doing,
Sophia.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.560
And do you regret it?

15:19.280 --> 15:21.440
It was a different decision
to the one that you're making...

15:21.480 --> 15:24.640
So how did your mum react when you
told her you were giving me up?

15:24.680 --> 15:26.000
(EXHALES)

15:27.440 --> 15:30.120
I didn't tell my mother
what I was planning on doing.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.160
It was something I did on my own.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.520
My mother was...

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
My mother was not someone
I felt I could go to.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.440
I've been reading about
the different kinds of adoption.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.520
There's open adoption
and there's closed adoption.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.760
Did you consider an open...
Sophia, don't do this.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.960
No, no, no. Come on, Grace.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.880
At the time, I didn't think
that an open adoption was fair.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.520
To who?
To you.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.720
To me. To everyone.

16:00.760 --> 16:05.760
I've... I thought that your parents
should be your parents.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.880
And if I couldn't give that to you,
then...

16:08.920 --> 16:11.200
Better to have
nothing to do with me.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.560
It wasn't because I didn't love you.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.320
I did love you.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.240
I didn't have the support
that you have.

16:22.280 --> 16:26.520
I don't want to be a parent
right now.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.760
I still have things I want to do.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.560
I want...

16:35.920 --> 16:38.520
Do you know what,
she's my baby, not yours.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.160
And this is my life.
I don't want to do this right now.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.640
Come on, I'll take you home.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.280
No, I just...want to be by myself,
thanks.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.880

17:19.920 --> 17:23.080
OK. Amazing. But you wanted to
have her at home, right?

17:23.120 --> 17:24.680
Yeah, nah. Ditched that plan.

at home anymore.

No, no, not at all. But if you want,
Max and I can take you home.

Sure. Welcome.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.160
How are you feeling?
Yeah, good.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.560
Feeling heavy?
Very heavy.

Yep. OK, I've brought the peas.

we've always known each other.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.240
Completely relaxed.

34:18.280 --> 34:23.920
She's open. She's direct.
She's so grounded.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.440
She's beautiful.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.200
That's wonderful.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.640
So, what's the problem?

34:33.760 --> 34:36.720
Oh, I just seem to have wasted
all this precious time

34:36.760 --> 34:38.360
pushing Grace's buttons...

34:39.680 --> 34:41.040
stuffing things up.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.200
Why can't I make a decent connection
with my own daughter?

34:44.240 --> 34:47.040
I am so proud of her

34:47.080 --> 34:50.720
but I just can't seem to
uncross the wires, you know.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.240
What's wrong with me?

34:52.280 --> 34:54.240
There's nothing wrong with you.

34:54.280 --> 34:55.880
I mean, who doesn't stuff things up?

34:55.920 --> 34:59.080
Anyway, it's a two-way street.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.840
I'm sure you'll get there.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.240
Yeah.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.640
You're a bit young to be so wise.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.600
Oh, don't speak too soon.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.040
There's still a lot
you don't know about me.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.480
I'm glad that you feel comfortable
talking to me, though.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.280
I do.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.840
And you can always call me on it
if I'm talking nonsense.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.480
Well, so far, so good.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.440
MAX: People really do let you
into their lives, don't they?

35:43.040 --> 35:44.800
Yeah, sometimes.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.960
Was Sophia a homebirth?

35:52.560 --> 35:54.640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.880
No, no...
You don't have to...

35:55.920 --> 35:58.480
No, um, I don't think
anyone's ever asked me that before.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.480
Uh, no, I had her
in a birthing centre.

36:04.840 --> 36:08.040
That is a long time
to keep a secret.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.400
(SCOFFS)

36:11.440 --> 36:13.400
You don't get to judge me.

36:14.480 --> 36:18.320
No, I wasn't.
No, Grace, I would...

36:18.360 --> 36:20.120
I would never...
OK. OK.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.840
Well, it wasn't a secret.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.840
The people that needed to know
did know.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.440
And it's nobody else's business.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.000
To most people,
you're either a monster

36:34.040 --> 36:36.120
or they just feel sorry for you.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.520
It's a bit like being in the army.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.240
Yeah, what was that about?

36:45.800 --> 36:47.000
You don't get to judge me.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.400
Ever. (LAUGHS) No, no!

36:49.440 --> 36:51.720
Argh!
Argh... I'll throw you in.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.360
I don't know, I don't know.
I, uh...

36:56.400 --> 37:00.880
I didn't know what I wanted to do,
so I thought maybe some discipline.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.440
My parents were against it.
That was a big part of the draw.

37:07.720 --> 37:12.560
It was a way to...get away.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.680
There wasn't a five-year plan.

37:17.720 --> 37:22.000
I just...did it.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.040
Do you regret it?

37:26.720 --> 37:28.320
Not for a second.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.400
Lily wants you to get the baby
out of her now.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.800
Exciting.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.920
Push. Push.
(LILY MOANS)

37:47.960 --> 37:51.120
You're doing brilliantly, Lily.
(MOANS)

37:51.160 --> 37:55.640
OK, that's it. Push. Push.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.080
Breathe. Take a breath.
You're doing so well.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.000
Really.
Just keep breathing.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.720
(MOANS)

38:01.760 --> 38:03.800
Hey, Juno.

38:04.680 --> 38:08.400
Hey, Juno. You want to come over?
(MOANS)

38:08.440 --> 38:10.760
Hello, darling.
Come in, sweetie.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.040
Oh... Hello, baby.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.520
Hi.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.200
You gonna breathe with Mummy?

38:16.240 --> 38:17.480
Ready? (TAKES DEEP BREATHS)

38:17.520 --> 38:21.040
You're doing so well, Lily.
So well. Keep breathing.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.040
That's it. So close now.
Oooh...

38:23.080 --> 38:24.440
Hey. Hey.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.400
Come here.
(MOANS)

38:27.920 --> 38:29.920
So good. Nearly there.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.000
Great job, Lily.
OK, one more big push, yeah?

38:38.400 --> 38:40.320
You're so close now. That's it.
(MOANS)

38:40.360 --> 38:42.360
Push. Deep down, deep down.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.560
(MOANS)

38:46.800 --> 38:48.880
Can you feel that?
That's your baby's head.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.880
She's so close now.
That's it. Go.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.720
(MOANS)
Here we go.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.200
Push, push, push, push, push...

38:56.880 --> 38:58.960
(MOANS)
It's a boy.

39:02.120 --> 39:05.480
(BABY CRIES)

39:07.960 --> 39:10.960
(LAID-BACK MUSIC PLAYS)

39:19.680 --> 39:21.960
(LAUGHS)

39:29.120 --> 39:31.200
Oh, hello.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.760
You're such a good girl.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.400
And what do you think
we should call him?

39:55.440 --> 39:57.040
I'll just be two seconds.
OK.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.760
Hey, hey!

39:59.800 --> 40:03.000
Um... I'm so sorry...
about before. You know, the, um...

40:03.040 --> 40:04.880
Oh, the masturbating?
Yeah.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.200
That's not a problem.
Hey.

40:07.920 --> 40:11.400
Just, um, it's been a while,
you know.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.800
And just hearing Lily breathing
and moaning, it really got me going.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.800
Just had to let off some steam.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.080
That's no problem at all.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.200
It's your house.

40:19.240 --> 40:20.560
It's a beautiful boy
you've got there.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.720
The baby, I mean. Not the...
Yeah, no, I got it.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.080
Max!
See you.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.120
OK.
Bye.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.080
What was that about?
Oh, uh, no, nothing.

40:30.120 --> 40:35.240
No, that was just a, um...
a 'snake out of its tank' incident.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.360
Do you want to get a coffee?
Oh, I can't.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.920
I've gotta go home
and face the music.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.560
I've let Sophia down.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.280
Sure.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.800
Laney?

40:55.840 --> 40:58.640
I think I might want to have a baby.

40:58.680 --> 40:59.720
Right now?

40:59.760 --> 41:02.880
No, just, um, as a general concept.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.680
I think.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.800
Maybe.
(LAUGHS) OK.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.400
What's your reaction?

41:08.440 --> 41:11.760
Uh...yeah.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.640
Yes.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.280
If that's what you want.

41:15.320 --> 41:16.760
It's worth thinking about.

41:16.800 --> 41:19.600
Well, I'm going to have a shower
and go to bed.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.080
OK.
(LAUGHS)

41:21.120 --> 41:22.360
Bye.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.240
Yeah.

KIRK: (WHISPERS) Good girl.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.680
Hey.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.520
Hello.
(BABY CRIES)

42:03.560 --> 42:05.240
Coffee?

42:05.280 --> 42:07.800
Oh... Yes, please.

42:07.840 --> 42:11.800
Baby wouldn't sleep last night,
so I ended up staying.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.040
Is that OK?

42:13.080 --> 42:15.240
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Here, let me.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.520
(LAUGHS)

42:20.120 --> 42:22.200
Oh, let's fix your little hat up.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.600
That's a girl.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.200
You get any sleep last night?

42:33.240 --> 42:35.800
No.

42:35.840 --> 42:37.640
You must be tired.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.360
Very.

42:41.400 --> 42:44.320
(SETS ITEM DOWN, POURS)

43:10.600 --> 43:13.360
I'm 34,
I'm about to lose my house,

43:13.840 --> 43:16.000
no relationship
and my jobs under review.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.480
Is that what you want?
A relationship?

43:21.600 --> 43:23.920
I know in my heart
I'm not meant to be a parent.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.160
VOICE-OVER: A battle is brewing.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.120
I have thought about it.
I should adopt Eadie.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.400
No.

43:31.360 --> 43:33.640
You shouldn't be making decisions
behind her back.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.760
I think that I am a better fit.

43:34.800 --> 43:36.320
...will be divided.

43:37.560 --> 43:39.680
You wanna adopt my baby.
So, let's hear your pitch.

43:43.280 --> 43:46.360
Grace, I'm so glad that I met you,
but stay out of my life.
