00:00.208 --> 00:02.000
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.083 --> 00:06.041
The boys are in my class because I'm
the only teacher who can handle them.

00:06.125 --> 00:08.792
We may no longer
be able to accommodate them.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.375
<i>Ultimatums were made.</i>

00:10.500 --> 00:13.417
She used this to kill herself.
Why would you keep it?

00:13.500 --> 00:14.959
<i>Questions were asked.</i>

00:15.041 --> 00:18.375
- Are you OK?
- I think he's hiding something.

00:18.458 --> 00:22.625
<i>And lots of evidence was uncovered.</i>

00:22.709 --> 00:24.583
What is it you hired me to do?

00:24.667 --> 00:27.750
Someone sent that note to my wife.
I need to know who.

00:27.834 --> 00:29.500
You like Alfred Hitchcock?

00:29.583 --> 00:32.291
I found it in the ruins of Edie's home.

00:32.375 --> 00:34.375
I found it in our bed. It's not mine.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.792
<i>Talk about dirty laundry.</i>

00:43.208 --> 00:46.583
<i>Every neighborhood</i>
<i>has a woman like Alberta Frome.</i>

00:46.667 --> 00:50.166
<i>And every woman like Mrs. Frome</i>
<i>has a cat.</i>

00:50.250 --> 00:52.375
<i>When she traveled,</i>

00:52.458 --> 00:56.834
<i>Mrs. Frome would arrange for friends</i>
<i>to look after her beloved pet.</i>

00:56.917 --> 01:02.625
<i>This time, however, she was forced</i>
<i>to ask her neighbor, Susan Mayer.</i>

01:02.709 --> 01:05.083
<i>Mrs. Frome liked Susan.</i>

01:05.166 --> 01:07.709
<i>But it was common knowledge</i>
<i>on Wisteria Lane,</i>

01:07.792 --> 01:12.041
<i>where Susan Mayer went,</i>
<i>bad luck was sure to follow.</i>

01:12.125 --> 01:15.166
<i>Her misfortunes ranged</i>
<i>from the commonplace</i>

01:16.208 --> 01:19.041
<i>to the unusual,</i>

01:21.792 --> 01:24.333
<i>to the truly bizarre.</i>

01:27.333 --> 01:33.125
<i>As she waved goodbye, she worried</i>
<i>that Susan's bad luck would continue.</i>

01:33.208 --> 01:36.458
<i>For that matter, so did her cat.</i>

01:41.500 --> 01:45.458
Mr. Whiskers. Dinner time.

01:45.542 --> 01:48.041
Here, kitty.

01:49.125 --> 01:54.041
That's weird.
Cats can't open drawers, can they?

01:54.125 --> 01:57.041
- You didn't leave them open?
- No way.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.834
Do you think somebody broke in?

02:06.375 --> 02:09.041
Mr. Whiskers?

02:21.166 --> 02:23.625
<i>Though she didn't know it at the time,</i>

02:23.750 --> 02:29.375
<i>Susan's luck</i>
<i>had finally started to change.</i>

03:10.625 --> 03:14.291
<i>News that an intruder had breached</i>
<i>the security of Wisteria Lane</i>

03:14.375 --> 03:16.583
<i>spread like wildfire.</i>

03:16.667 --> 03:19.333
<i>At a Neighborhood Watch meeting</i>
<i>the next night,</i>

03:19.417 --> 03:21.500
<i>residents voiced their concerns</i>

03:21.583 --> 03:25.041
<i>over the increasing dangers</i>
<i>their community faced.</i>

03:25.125 --> 03:29.083
<i>Mrs. Ida Greenberg said someone was</i>
<i>looking through her bathroom window</i>

03:29.166 --> 03:31.583
<i>whenever she took a shower.</i>

03:31.709 --> 03:34.959
<i>Bob Fisk warned those present</i>
<i>that a government agency</i>

03:35.041 --> 03:37.709
<i>was listening in</i>
<i>on their phone conversations.</i>

03:37.792 --> 03:41.500
<i>Helen Vale spoke of</i>
<i>a ruthless local teenage gang</i>

03:41.625 --> 03:43.709
<i>that had egged her minivan.</i>

03:45.000 --> 03:47.041
Three factors contribute to...

03:47.166 --> 03:50.834
<i>The evening concluded with Officer</i>
<i>Thompson offering safety tips</i>

03:50.959 --> 03:53.041
<i>and a plan of action.</i>

03:53.125 --> 03:55.208
...you have some control over.

03:55.291 --> 04:00.166
You can sign up for daily or nightly
patrols, which might seem like overkill,

04:00.333 --> 04:05.125
but regular surveillance will deter
even the most determined criminal.

04:05.208 --> 04:11.208
Are there any other questions?
All right. Let's be careful out there.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.959
- Actually, do you have a second?
- Sure. How can I help?

04:17.041 --> 04:19.667
I'm the one who discovered the break-in.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.375
- I think I found some evidence.
- Evidence?

04:22.458 --> 04:27.542
This is a screwdriver left behind
by the burglar. I didn't touch it.

04:27.625 --> 04:30.417
Why didn't you give this
to the investigators?

04:30.542 --> 04:32.625
I tried and they laughed at me.

04:32.709 --> 04:34.834
Nothing was taken from the house.

04:34.917 --> 04:37.875
I apologize.
That was totally unprofessional.

04:37.959 --> 04:42.041
Thank you. So you think
it should be dusted for prints?

04:42.125 --> 04:45.875
- Yes. And I'll make sure it gets done.
- Great.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
Bye.

04:55.792 --> 04:58.500
Boys, stop it. Go to bed.

04:58.583 --> 05:01.792
- We're not tired.
- Well, at least go upstairs.

05:01.875 --> 05:04.750
- We want to play.
- Look.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.542
Gimme.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.375
Go.

05:15.458 --> 05:19.000
So why weren't you sitting with Mike?
I thought you two were an item.

05:19.083 --> 05:22.166
I sort of thought so too.
Getting a lot of mixed signals.

05:22.250 --> 05:26.125
I'll tell you who wasn't giving mixed
signals. Sexy Officer Thompson.

05:26.208 --> 05:28.834
- He stared at you all night.
- You noticed that?

05:28.917 --> 05:32.208
Honey, trust me, when
they're not staring at me, I notice.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.959
I appreciate you guys
staying and helping.

05:35.041 --> 05:37.166
Please. I would have hosted it myself

05:37.291 --> 05:40.583
but there's camping equipment
everywhere.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.750
It's nice of you.

05:42.834 --> 05:45.834
There's something else nice
that I'd like you to do.

05:45.917 --> 05:48.917
Your kids both went to Barcliff Academy,
didn't they?

05:49.000 --> 05:53.375
We need you to recommend Porter and
Preston. We can't get an interview.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.375
You want me to recommend the twins?

05:55.458 --> 05:58.834
Yes. You can tell them
how beautifully behaved the boys are.

05:58.917 --> 06:02.208
- So you want me to lie?
- Yeah. I thought that was understood.

06:02.291 --> 06:04.417
I'm very well respected at Barcliff,

06:04.500 --> 06:07.041
and my word
won't be good there any more.

06:07.125 --> 06:10.917
Yes, but by the time they realize
their mistake, we'll be in.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.041
You're not having any more kids.
What do you care?

06:14.166 --> 06:17.792
I had hoped some day to get
my grandchildren into Barcliff.

06:17.875 --> 06:20.625
But I suppose
that doesn't matter to you, does it?

06:20.709 --> 06:22.792
It really doesn't.

06:22.875 --> 06:25.375
We've got to get rid of it.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.041
- I said leave it alone.
- No. You can't stop me.

06:29.125 --> 06:32.667
- Paul and Zach are fighting again.
- The second time this week.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.291
They never fought
when Mary Alice was alive.

06:35.375 --> 06:38.000
It's a shame.
They used to be such a happy family.

06:38.125 --> 06:42.500
Just because you didn't hear them
fighting, doesn't mean they were happy.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.959
<i>The next day, as residents</i>
<i>began to patrol Wisteria Lane</i>

06:54.041 --> 06:58.166
<i>in the hopes of</i>
<i>foiling potential burglars,</i>

06:58.250 --> 07:02.458
<i>Gabrielle was about to experience</i>
<i>a home invasion of her own.</i>

07:06.750 --> 07:09.959
Mama Solis. What are you doing here?

07:10.041 --> 07:13.959
I came to visit my son and
daughter-in-law. What does it look like?

07:14.041 --> 07:16.458
Does Carlos know you're coming?

07:16.542 --> 07:18.834
No. He likes to be surprised.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.583
Now come.

07:22.667 --> 07:25.125
Gabrielle. Come.

07:28.417 --> 07:31.417
Family should always hug,

07:31.500 --> 07:35.834
regardless of how they feel
about each other.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.417
She's a beauty. 30-footer?

08:02.500 --> 08:03.959
32.

08:04.083 --> 08:08.166
Sweet. I sail. I've got a Flying Scott.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.041
We have several
yachting enthusiasts here.

08:11.125 --> 08:14.333
- I could introduce them to you...
- That sounds great.

08:14.417 --> 08:17.417
...if we decide to enroll your children.

08:19.959 --> 08:22.500
To be honest, Mr. and Mrs. Scavo,

08:22.625 --> 08:25.083
your children's educational background

08:25.166 --> 08:28.625
is a bit more common
than we would prefer.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.542
But Mrs. Van De Kamp said
they were identical twins?

08:31.625 --> 08:35.917
Yes. You can't tell them apart.
They're like book ends.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.125
We do strive for diversity at Barcliff.

08:38.208 --> 08:40.625
Identical twins could be interesting.

08:40.750 --> 08:45.125
The boys are fascinating. They even have
their own twin secret language.

08:45.250 --> 08:49.792
- Yeah, it's pretty scary.
- Not so much scary as highly developed.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.458
Yeah, they bark and growl at each other.

08:52.542 --> 08:56.375
Tom, Mr. Lentz was trying
to say something. Go ahead.

08:56.458 --> 09:00.125
I'd love to meet these twins of yours.
I tell you what.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.583
I'll put them on our "must-meet list".

09:02.667 --> 09:05.667
- Terrific.
- Thank you so much.

09:05.792 --> 09:10.250
- What is a "must-meet list"?
- We bring them in for observation.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.000
Observation?

09:12.083 --> 09:16.333
To see how they play with the other
children, how they respond to authority,

09:16.417 --> 09:18.625
that sort of thing.

09:18.709 --> 09:21.959
- Great.
- That sounds wonderful.

09:29.375 --> 09:32.667
- Kids ready?
- Almost. Thanks for driving them.

09:32.792 --> 09:35.500
Happy to do it. I miss them.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.834
Did you hear there was a break-in
at Mrs. Frome's?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.250
Yeah. I heard they didn't take anything.

09:46.375 --> 09:50.125
It's still frightening.
He could have been a sexual predator.

09:50.208 --> 09:54.750
And he ended up at Mrs. Frome's? That
would have been a lose-lose situation.

09:54.834 --> 09:57.542
Rex, that's not the point.

09:58.834 --> 10:02.375
I don't feel safe. I was wondering
if you could spend the night.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.291
You're in the NRA. You own four guns.

10:05.375 --> 10:08.166
If somebody broke in
I'd expect you to protect me.

10:10.667 --> 10:13.000
Rex, the truth is, with the kids gone,

10:13.083 --> 10:17.333
I'll be all by myself in this house
for the first time in 17 years.

10:17.417 --> 10:21.291
I know it's hard to hear, but the
marriage counseling might not work.

10:21.375 --> 10:24.083
You need to get used to being alone.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.417
You're right. That was hard to hear.

10:33.125 --> 10:35.583
- What are you doing?
- That is for the kids.

10:35.667 --> 10:40.542
Come on. I'm staying at a motel.
I haven't had a decent meal in weeks.

10:40.667 --> 10:43.250
The marriage counseling
might not work out.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.333
You need to get used to bad cooking.

10:52.709 --> 10:54.834
Screwdriver girl.

10:57.041 --> 11:00.500
I took your evidence into the lab
for fingerprints.

11:00.583 --> 11:02.041
Really? That's great.

11:02.125 --> 11:05.792
- I'll call you if I hear something.
- OK.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.083
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

11:08.166 --> 11:11.875
Actually, I'd like to call you anyway
if that's OK.

11:14.166 --> 11:17.792
You seem like a really sweet guy
in an interesting line of work

11:17.875 --> 11:21.208
but I'm not really available.

11:22.792 --> 11:25.792
- You have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, sort of.

11:25.917 --> 11:30.375
- Sort of.
- It's hard to explain. Even to myself.

11:30.458 --> 11:33.333
<i>Unit 23, we have a 907A in progress.</i>
<i>Please respond.</i>

11:33.458 --> 11:37.709
Ten-four. I'm on my way. I gotta go.
Apparently there's a hostage situation.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.542
So you're really turning me down?

11:41.625 --> 11:45.792
- Boy. My self-esteem can't take this.
- I'm sorry.

11:45.875 --> 11:51.041
No, it's just, now my ability to help
those hostages has been compromised.

11:51.166 --> 11:55.125
- Still, don't blame yourself.
- Blame myself?

11:55.208 --> 11:59.834
Yeah. It's hard to rescue folks
when you don't feel good about yourself.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.542
- They'll probably all die anyway.
- OK, fine. I'll go out with you.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.083
Great. I'll call you.

12:07.166 --> 12:11.375
Now that you've got your date,
you can tell me what 907A really means.

12:11.500 --> 12:16.500
- Someone's TV was playing too loud.
- Thank God for the Thin Blue Line.

12:16.583 --> 12:18.834
I'll call you.

12:28.458 --> 12:31.208
I'll be outside doing my yoga.

12:32.709 --> 12:34.959
I'll be right back.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.166
Must you do that now?
My mother's here.

12:39.291 --> 12:43.875
I'm not gonna stop my life
just because she shows up unannounced.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.375
She's family.
She doesn't need an invite.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.709
Whatever. It's rude.

12:52.667 --> 12:56.709
It's real pretty, Mama.
You were always good with your hands.

12:56.792 --> 13:02.333
So, I assume you didn't insist that
I travel 2,000 miles for small talk.

13:02.458 --> 13:05.417
So why am I here?

13:07.875 --> 13:09.458
She...

13:12.083 --> 13:13.500
...is unhappy.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.583
I've given her
everything she ever wanted,

13:17.667 --> 13:19.959
but it doesn't seem
to make a difference.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.583
I feel her drifting
further and further away.

13:24.709 --> 13:28.291
And lately I've started thinking
that maybe...

13:28.375 --> 13:30.750
So you think she's cheating on you?

13:34.417 --> 13:36.500
I think so.

13:45.083 --> 13:48.709
We can talk about your problems,
but I'm not gonna have any of that.

13:53.542 --> 13:57.750
- Do you have any proof?
- No. It's just a feeling.

13:57.834 --> 14:01.125
I had that feeling with your father
and that whore waitress.

14:01.250 --> 14:04.834
And I was right.
Always trust your feelings.

14:04.917 --> 14:08.375
- So what do I do?
- You don't do anything.

14:08.458 --> 14:11.000
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you, Mama.

14:11.125 --> 14:14.500
I'm sorry I had to hit you,
but we're strong people.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.875
We don't cry about our problems.

14:21.959 --> 14:24.291
We find ways to fix them.

14:30.875 --> 14:34.041
<i>While the residents of Wisteria Lane</i>
<i>kept up their patrols</i>

14:34.166 --> 14:36.583
<i>in an effort to prevent</i>
<i>future break-ins,</i>

14:36.667 --> 14:41.542
<i>Lynette hatched a plan to break</i>
<i>her children into Barcliff Academy.</i>

14:41.625 --> 14:45.125
Boys, wake up.

14:45.208 --> 14:49.834
Come on.
We're gonna have some fun today.

14:49.917 --> 14:53.667
- Come on.
- Mum. Hi.

14:56.834 --> 14:58.917
Come on. I bet you can beat me.

15:03.834 --> 15:07.208
Go. Yes. Mush.

15:12.208 --> 15:14.291
Mum, I'm tired.

15:15.792 --> 15:19.125
If I can still see your head,
the pool's not deep enough.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.542
Are your boys usually so docile?

15:26.542 --> 15:28.875
They're always a little shy at first.

15:31.166 --> 15:35.500
Look at that concentration.
Porter loves his puzzles.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.750
Mama, I'll be right back.
I'm going to the store.

15:56.542 --> 16:01.000
Gabrielle. I'm coming with you.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.291
I want to make some <i>tamales </i>for Carlos.

16:03.417 --> 16:07.083
I'm not going to the supermarket.
I'm going to the lingerie store.

16:07.166 --> 16:10.166
- Good. I need some bras.
- I'm gonna be a while.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.375
I might get a facial.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.667
I have a face.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.000
- Hey, Mike.
- How's it going?

16:20.083 --> 16:23.917
- Good. Just came by to say hello.
- Hello.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.834
So you remember the cop from
the Neighborhood Watch meeting?

16:27.917 --> 16:32.834
He agreed to run a fingerprint check on
the screwdriver I found at Mrs. Frome's.

16:32.917 --> 16:36.125
He did? Nothing was taken.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.041
Still, somebody broke in. It is a crime.

16:39.125 --> 16:43.041
So the weird thing is
the cop asked me out.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.542
On a date.

16:45.625 --> 16:51.959
And I sort of said yes. I was just
curious what you thought about that.

16:53.417 --> 16:56.250
You're asking my permission
to go out with him?

16:56.375 --> 17:02.166
No. I just was wondering your opinion.

17:02.291 --> 17:04.542
I don't really have one.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.875
OK. Great.

17:09.959 --> 17:12.333
Fine.

17:12.417 --> 17:16.583
- Thank you.
- Susan, wait. I...

17:18.959 --> 17:24.792
I'm sorry. My life
is just really complicated right now.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.458
You don't have to explain.

17:27.542 --> 17:30.667
- Susan.
- It's complicated. I get it.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.542
Paul?

17:46.291 --> 17:48.834
Hi, Zachary.
Sorry, the door was open and...

17:48.917 --> 17:51.875
It's OK. You can come in.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.291
Is your father here?
We're scheduled to do a patrol today.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.834
He had to go out of town. Again.

17:59.417 --> 18:03.917
Oh. Well, I guess I can do it by myself.

18:07.917 --> 18:10.959
This place is just immaculate.

18:11.041 --> 18:15.917
- My mum liked things clean.
- She would be very proud of you.

18:17.125 --> 18:19.166
What happened to your varnish?

18:19.250 --> 18:23.750
That's where my mother died. I messed up
the floor trying to get out the blood.

18:27.875 --> 18:32.875
- I'll tell my dad that you stopped by.
- OK.

18:34.375 --> 18:38.208
Zach, do you have plans for dinner?

18:47.250 --> 18:50.542
- So you shop a lot?
- Yeah. So?

18:50.625 --> 18:54.959
Most women that shop a lot, it's because
they don't have anything better to do.

18:55.041 --> 18:58.125
- What's your point?
- Well, if you had children...

18:58.250 --> 19:01.917
- Here we go.
- Children give your life a purpose.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.417
You're so busy taking care of them

19:04.542 --> 19:07.083
you don't have time
to wonder if you're happy.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.083
You know, this is so like you.

19:09.208 --> 19:12.542
I invite you on a nice shopping trip
and you find ways to upset me.

19:12.625 --> 19:15.083
You didn't invite me. I invited myself.

19:17.333 --> 19:21.000
You keep looking at your watch.
Is there some place you have to be?

19:21.083 --> 19:24.542
No. And I am not one of those women
who has a hole in her heart

19:24.625 --> 19:26.667
that can only be filled by a baby.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.750
I like my life a lot.
It's very fulfilling.

19:31.041 --> 19:34.458
Excuse my daughter-in-law.
She's very fulfilled.

19:36.041 --> 19:39.458
- So he just blew you off?
- I told him another man asked me out.

19:39.542 --> 19:43.375
It was a perfect opportunity
for Mike to be jealous, and nothing.

19:43.458 --> 19:46.250
It doesn't work
if you don't bat your eyes.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.875
I batted everything
that wasn't nailed down. Nothing.

19:50.458 --> 19:53.000
- Thanks.
- So what's going on there?

19:56.375 --> 19:57.458
Gophers.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.750
I'm sorry about Mike.
I know you like him.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.417
Maybe it's my fault. Maybe
I imagined an entire relationship

20:05.500 --> 20:07.625
with this man that didn't exist.

20:07.709 --> 20:09.792
There has been flirting.

20:09.875 --> 20:15.834
And the flirting made me think he was
kind, trustworthy, honest and hygienic.

20:17.417 --> 20:22.000
A guy just smiles at me three times
and I'm picking out wedding china.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.959
- I'm a mess.
- But that's part of your charm.

20:25.041 --> 20:27.166
That's what happened with Karl.

20:27.250 --> 20:30.458
I only dated him a couple of months.
It was a disaster.

20:30.542 --> 20:33.083
You think Mike is a Karl in disguise?

20:33.166 --> 20:38.375
I don't know. What does that mean,
anyway? "My life is complicated."

20:45.542 --> 20:48.417
If I wanted to sit around
I could do it on the can.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.250
You're late. What's with the face?

20:52.333 --> 20:55.792
I screwed up. I broke into
the Frome house. I almost got caught.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.291
What's "almost"?

20:57.375 --> 21:00.291
I left something behind
with my prints on it.

21:00.375 --> 21:02.959
- Ever hear of gloves?
- It's the suburbs.

21:03.041 --> 21:04.583
I didn't think it'd matter.

21:04.667 --> 21:08.000
Anyway, the police are running a check
and I'm in the system.

21:08.083 --> 21:11.208
I gotta pull up stakes
before they come looking for me.

21:13.875 --> 21:17.291
That's a sweet sound.
Laughter like that, huh?

21:18.458 --> 21:21.166
Pisses me off.

21:21.250 --> 21:24.083
If and when your cover is blown,
you disappear.

21:24.166 --> 21:28.375
Until then,
you keep fixing the neighbors' pipes.

21:28.458 --> 21:31.458
The longer I'm here,
the more I think we're wrong.

21:31.542 --> 21:35.417
- These are nice people.
- My money says one of them isn't.

21:38.583 --> 21:39.583
Thanks.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.750
No more screw-ups.

22:05.083 --> 22:08.208
I'm getting something to drink.
Do you want something?

22:27.041 --> 22:30.458
- Don't be mad.
- I waited for three hours for you.

22:30.625 --> 22:33.792
I used a month's worth
of lunch money to pay for that room.

22:34.875 --> 22:38.542
It's not my fault.
Juanita hasn't let me out of her sight.

22:38.625 --> 22:43.417
- Really? Well, I don't see her now.
- She's watching her Mexican soap opera.

22:43.500 --> 22:47.625
The rebel's virgin daughter is being
seduced by the escaped desperado.

22:47.792 --> 22:52.417
So until she puts out,
Juanita won't even know that I'm gone.

22:54.959 --> 22:57.250
Come on. I said I was sorry.

22:57.333 --> 23:01.250
Just so you know, I've turned down
half the pep-squad for you.

23:01.333 --> 23:03.417
You can't be serious.

23:03.500 --> 23:07.375
I'm starting to think that maybe
I should be with someone my own age.

23:07.458 --> 23:11.000
I thought teenage girls bored you, John.

23:11.083 --> 23:13.667
- I thought what we had was beyond that.
- So did I.

23:15.750 --> 23:18.000
Why go back to something you don't want?

23:18.083 --> 23:20.417
- I don't know.
- Maybe you're tired of me.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.917
No. I want to be with you.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.291
Then why are we arguing?

23:26.375 --> 23:28.667
- Gabrielle.
- Damn it.

23:28.750 --> 23:31.959
- The virgin gave it up already?
- I want you so bad.

23:32.041 --> 23:34.333
- When can I see you again?
- Tomorrow.

23:34.417 --> 23:36.458
Meet me at the mall after school.

23:36.542 --> 23:39.917
- What about your mother-in-law?
- I'll think of something.

23:41.041 --> 23:45.667
- Gabrielle.
- Coming.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.959
A donation?
Now Barcliff wants a donation?

23:49.041 --> 23:52.250
Apparently we're in competition
with one other family.

23:52.333 --> 23:55.709
A generous donation will ensure
our kids beat 'em out.

23:55.792 --> 23:58.542
- How generous?
- 15 thousand.

23:58.709 --> 24:01.208
- We don't have that.
- That's what I told them.

24:01.291 --> 24:06.834
So what will we do? Public school is out
unless we move to a new district.

24:06.917 --> 24:09.667
We're not moving.

24:11.291 --> 24:14.750
Maybe it's time
that we look into home schooling.

24:16.166 --> 24:20.041
- I know you did not just say that.
- Honey, it's got its advantages.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.750
Kids at home school
do better in later years.

24:22.875 --> 24:25.875
They won't make it
if I have to spend all day with them.

24:25.959 --> 24:29.417
Honey, sometimes
you've just got to make the sacrifice.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.417
It's probably best for the kids.

24:31.500 --> 24:35.000
Let's put them back in me
and cook them until they're civilized.

24:35.083 --> 24:37.625
You'd be cool with that?

24:40.542 --> 24:44.583
- I've never had plum pudding before.
- I'm serving it for Christmas.

24:44.667 --> 24:48.041
I like to try out new recipes
before the actual holiday.

24:48.125 --> 24:52.166
That way, if the cookbook's
gotten it wrong, I can fix it.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.542
You must really like Christmas.

24:54.625 --> 24:58.083
You and Mr. Van De Kamp
always have the best decorations.

24:58.166 --> 25:00.291
I adore the holidays.

25:00.375 --> 25:03.542
I never get depressed
if there's a decorated tree.

25:03.625 --> 25:07.000
My mum and I would always
decorate our tree together.

25:07.125 --> 25:11.083
- This Christmas is gonna be weird.
- Zach.

25:12.125 --> 25:17.000
You know, my mother died
when I was young. She was hit by a car.

25:18.625 --> 25:22.667
It was right before Christmas,
as a matter of fact.

25:22.750 --> 25:26.709
We were all singing carols
and the dog was howling

25:26.792 --> 25:30.250
because everybody in my family
sings off-key except for me.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.542
Anyway, it was a terrible ruckus.

25:34.250 --> 25:39.041
So no one noticed when my mother
went out to give the neighbors a gift.

25:39.166 --> 25:42.500
The next thing we heard
were brakes screeching.

25:46.125 --> 25:48.333
Most of my family went to the hospital

25:48.458 --> 25:50.834
but I stayed home
because I was so young.

25:53.458 --> 25:57.250
When I looked out the window
I saw my mother's blood on the street

25:57.333 --> 25:59.667
and nobody was doing anything about it.

25:59.750 --> 26:03.375
So I got a hose and I washed it off.

26:04.917 --> 26:08.125
And once it was clean,
I felt so much better.

26:11.542 --> 26:14.208
I've never told anyone
that story before.

26:14.291 --> 26:19.000
Those are the most interesting ones.
The stories that we never tell anyone.

26:19.083 --> 26:21.959
Yeah. You're probably right.

26:22.083 --> 26:24.417
I have one.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.834
It's more of a secret really.

26:28.166 --> 26:31.000
I know why my mum killed herself.

26:32.375 --> 26:35.542
- You do?
- It was something I did.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.125
Something bad.

26:43.083 --> 26:45.917
What did you do, Zach?

26:46.000 --> 26:50.417
- Zach. Sweetheart.
- No. I shouldn't have said anything.

26:50.542 --> 26:54.875
- If my dad found out...
- I won't tell your father.

26:54.959 --> 26:57.917
- I can't get you involved.
- Zachary, it's all right.

27:04.750 --> 27:07.333
What else did Zach tell you?

27:07.417 --> 27:11.500
Just that Mary Alice killed herself
because of something he'd done.

27:11.583 --> 27:14.667
- You couldn't get any more out of him?
- He was so nervous.

27:14.750 --> 27:17.458
He started shaking then he just left.

27:17.583 --> 27:20.125
OK, I think we should go to the police.

27:20.208 --> 27:23.500
And tell them what?
We don't even have the note any more.

27:23.583 --> 27:27.041
Get Zach to tell you something
so we have more to go on.

27:27.125 --> 27:30.667
You don't understand.
This poor kid is scared out of his mind.

27:30.750 --> 27:34.250
Bree, you're a woman.
Manipulate him. That's what we do.

27:34.375 --> 27:37.959
- But how?
- How did you usually manipulate Rex?

27:42.375 --> 27:46.208
Hello, Zachary.
Are you free for dinner tonight?

27:46.291 --> 27:47.750
Sure.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.959
Good. Because last night
you put me in such a holiday mood.

27:52.041 --> 27:56.333
I'm gonna make roast turkey
and candy yams and eggnog.

27:56.458 --> 27:59.625
Have you ever had
real, old-fashioned eggnog?

27:59.750 --> 28:03.291
- I don't think so.
- You are gonna love it.

28:03.375 --> 28:05.458
It has quite a kick.

28:06.959 --> 28:08.166
Me.

28:08.291 --> 28:12.542
- Preston.
- Boys, could you stop...

28:18.250 --> 28:20.917
<i>Lynette was desperate</i>
<i>to avoid home schooling.</i>

28:21.000 --> 28:23.709
<i>But she saw no options on the horizon.</i>

28:23.792 --> 28:27.500
<i>Until a solution sailed into view.</i>

28:29.125 --> 28:32.709
Gabrielle, please.
You bought me enough things.

28:32.792 --> 28:36.250
- You're the one who's shopping.
- Mama, you're in a rut.

28:36.333 --> 28:39.000
We need to spice up your wardrobe.
Here.

28:39.083 --> 28:41.959
Try this one on. Go on. Try it on.

28:46.125 --> 28:50.291
- How are you doing in there?
- Is it supposed to be so tight?

28:50.375 --> 28:53.000
Yes, it's form-fitting.
You'll look great.

28:53.083 --> 28:56.333
I don't think this dress
is right for me. I can't breathe.

28:58.959 --> 29:01.250
Well, maybe I made a mistake.

29:01.333 --> 29:06.208
While you change, I'm gonna make
a quick run to the book store.

29:06.291 --> 29:10.959
- Wait. I'm coming with you.
- No. I'll just be a minute.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.917
I'm coming with you.

29:18.125 --> 29:20.583
Wait.

29:23.583 --> 29:26.083
- Gabrielle. Wait.
- Ma'am.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.625
Ma'am. Sorry, I'm gonna need to look
in your bags, please.

29:30.709 --> 29:33.375
Fine. Just hurry up.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.542
Right on time.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.917
I don't know
where that blouse came from.

29:44.041 --> 29:46.959
- Security.
- Keep your stupid blouse.

29:47.041 --> 29:52.041
I have to find my daughter-in-law.
Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me.

29:52.125 --> 29:55.625
- You have to come with us.
- Get your hands off me.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.709
Hello.

30:06.792 --> 30:10.500
- It's me.
- Hi, Rex. How are you?

30:10.583 --> 30:14.667
- Is something wrong?
- I was just about to grab dinner

30:14.750 --> 30:18.542
and it occurred to me,
"What the heck? I'll go out."

30:18.625 --> 30:21.083
Would you like to have dinner with me?

30:26.208 --> 30:30.834
Mrs. Van De Kamp. Guess what. I found
all my mum's old Christmas stuff.

30:30.917 --> 30:33.959
Oh. Sweetie,
I was just coming over to talk to you.

30:34.083 --> 30:38.458
I am so sorry but something
important came up and I have to cancel.

30:38.583 --> 30:41.709
- Really?
- We'll do it again.

30:41.792 --> 30:45.709
We'll have our impromptu holiday dinner.
I promise.

30:55.583 --> 31:00.500
I got one. Kelly Halstatter. In eighth
grade, she used to spit in my gym shoes.

31:05.458 --> 31:10.083
Here, look. Two DUIs, one check-kiting
and an open bench warrant.

31:10.166 --> 31:13.792
How tragic. By which I mean, "Yay".

31:13.834 --> 31:16.542
You've been a good sport
coming on my shift.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.792
Well, time flies when
you're on a stakeout in Cracktown.

31:21.208 --> 31:26.667
- When does our official date begin?
- Taxpayers say 20 minutes. I say now.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.375
- They're down.
- Thank you.

31:33.792 --> 31:36.166
Honey, you read up on home schooling?

31:36.291 --> 31:39.375
Yeah. It gave me some good ideas.
Well, one, anyway.

31:39.458 --> 31:41.750
Great. What have you got?

31:41.834 --> 31:46.792
You know how we agree that one of us
needs to stay home and parent the kids

31:46.875 --> 31:49.417
and one of us needs to make a living?

31:49.500 --> 31:53.458
I remembered that when I was working
I made a little more than you.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.792
- What are you doing?
- You tossed out that sacrifice comment.

31:59.875 --> 32:03.709
It occurred to me, I've made sacrifices
over the past six years.

32:03.792 --> 32:05.542
I gave up my career.

32:05.667 --> 32:09.750
If another sacrifice has to be made,
I think it's your turn.

32:09.875 --> 32:12.125
- Lynette?
- If I went back to work,

32:12.208 --> 32:14.667
you could stay home
and take care of the kids.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.709
I can't be with the kids all day.
I'd lose my mind.

32:18.917 --> 32:23.250
Hey. OK, I get it.
Home schooling is out.

32:23.333 --> 32:26.625
How are we gonna scrape together
15 grand for this endowment?

32:28.417 --> 32:30.709
How, how, how...

32:33.709 --> 32:36.834
Think. Think real hard.

32:38.458 --> 32:41.750
- Oh, no.
- Aye-aye.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.792
The restaurant's run by
an old guy named Arinello.

32:45.917 --> 32:49.667
He will propose to you. Don't say yes
because he's dead serious.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.750
But what if I like him?

32:53.792 --> 32:58.458
Hey. I thought this went to the lab.

33:00.583 --> 33:02.750
All right. You got me.

33:02.834 --> 33:05.542
- And that means what?
- Look, Susan.

33:05.667 --> 33:09.750
No one would authorize lab time or
a computer search for a case like this.

33:09.834 --> 33:13.291
- It's just not a priority.
- Why couldn't you just tell me that?

33:13.417 --> 33:17.208
Well, I thought we were clicking.
Does this need to be a big deal?

33:17.291 --> 33:21.291
Well, if you'd only lied to me
about it once it wouldn't be.

33:21.375 --> 33:25.208
All right. I get it.
You want me to beg. OK.

33:25.291 --> 33:27.333
Look at me. I'm begging.

33:28.792 --> 33:31.291
Come on.
Don't be such a girl about this.

33:32.750 --> 33:36.625
I know who you are.
You're a Karl in disguise.

33:38.291 --> 33:40.709
I'm done with you. All of you.

33:40.792 --> 33:45.166
Oh, come on, drama queen.
What are you doing?

33:45.291 --> 33:47.625
Where are you going? It's not safe.

33:47.709 --> 33:51.125
I'd rather take my chances
on the street, thank you very much.

33:51.208 --> 33:53.542
Why do I always pick the psychos?

34:11.125 --> 34:13.166
Excuse me. I'm a little lost.

34:13.291 --> 34:15.542
You best be lost. This here's my corner.

34:15.667 --> 34:18.750
Oh, yes. And a lovely corner it is.

34:18.834 --> 34:21.542
And I hate to bother you
while you're working.

34:21.625 --> 34:24.667
Could you point me
in the direction of a payphone?

34:24.792 --> 34:30.250
Oh, if you have some change
for this five. Preferably quarters.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.709
If I got paid in quarters,
I'd be doing something very wrong.

34:33.834 --> 34:36.959
Right. OK.

34:38.417 --> 34:40.959
Thank you.

34:41.041 --> 34:45.208
Hey. You want to use my cell?
I have weekend minutes.

34:45.291 --> 34:48.208
Thank you so much.
You're saving my life.

34:48.333 --> 34:52.333
- Excuse me, honey.
- Oh, yes. You do what you've got to do.

34:58.834 --> 35:02.250
Oh, please answer.
Come on. Pick up, Julie.

35:02.375 --> 35:04.709
Oh, thank God. Don't ask any questions.

35:04.834 --> 35:08.625
Just get somebody to pick me up
at the corner of Ninth and Foster.

35:08.709 --> 35:11.041
Hey, babe.

35:11.125 --> 35:15.625
Thank you. No. I'm on a break.
Hurry, please.

35:17.542 --> 35:21.291
Excuse me. We got a call.
Something about a break-in.

35:21.375 --> 35:24.667
One of your neighbors saw someone
breaking into your home.

35:24.750 --> 35:28.250
We sent some guys out to investigate
and...

35:28.375 --> 35:30.417
- What is it?
- I gotta tell you, ma'am.

35:30.500 --> 35:34.041
I thought I'd seen a lot on the job,
but this is something else.

36:02.375 --> 36:04.458
So let me get this straight.

36:04.542 --> 36:07.250
He chopped down one of our pine trees?

36:07.333 --> 36:09.583
I'm afraid so.

36:13.750 --> 36:16.291
Zach, why did you do this?

36:16.375 --> 36:21.208
- I don't know.
- Take off those handcuffs, please.

36:21.291 --> 36:24.875
- He confessed to breaking in.
- This is not up for discussion.

36:26.750 --> 36:28.959
Go ahead.

36:29.750 --> 36:32.333
Sir, you can't...

36:32.417 --> 36:35.333
Zach.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.250
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

36:53.333 --> 36:56.291
Then how much for a trip
around the world?

36:56.375 --> 36:59.709
I can't believe Julie sent you.
She is soon gonna be dead.

36:59.834 --> 37:02.125
Come on. Get in.

37:05.959 --> 37:10.208
- Wasn't that sent in for prints?
- No. The cop lied to me.

37:10.333 --> 37:14.083
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just asking.

37:16.875 --> 37:20.250
Yes. Apparently they found
a blouse in her bag.

37:20.333 --> 37:24.917
I don't know, Carlos. At some point
older people start to get confused.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.792
She probably thought she paid for it.

37:27.875 --> 37:31.041
No, no charges. Everything's fine.

37:31.125 --> 37:33.792
OK. I'll tell her. Bye.

37:36.333 --> 37:39.667
Carlos is gonna be late for dinner.
It's just the two of us.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.875
- What would you like to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

37:42.959 --> 37:45.041
OK. Suit yourself.

37:45.125 --> 37:48.375
Don't go yet. I need to talk to you.

37:51.583 --> 37:53.750
It's important. Please.

37:58.458 --> 38:02.083
I married Diego Solis
when I was 16 years old.

38:03.125 --> 38:07.625
A few months into our marriage,
he started to beat me.

38:07.709 --> 38:10.166
I didn't know what to do.

38:10.250 --> 38:13.166
Juanita, I had no idea.

38:13.250 --> 38:16.792
It got so bad that I started
praying to God to let me die.

38:16.875 --> 38:21.542
But God, in his infinite wisdom,
gave me a reason to live.

38:21.625 --> 38:23.709
Carlos.

38:23.792 --> 38:26.625
Ah, he was a beautiful baby.

38:26.709 --> 38:29.000
But my husband wasn't much of a father.

38:29.083 --> 38:33.375
He never held him. He would yell
and scream at him for no reason at all.

38:33.458 --> 38:36.000
One night, when Carlos was four,

38:36.083 --> 38:38.917
Diego Solis came home drunk.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.166
He beat my Carlos.

38:42.250 --> 38:44.792
Something inside me snapped.

38:45.792 --> 38:49.041
At that moment,
I found a way to be strong.

38:49.542 --> 38:53.417
So I made sure that Diego Solis...

38:53.583 --> 38:57.333
never hurt my son or me ever again.

38:57.542 --> 38:59.625
What did you do?

38:59.709 --> 39:05.291
Well, if you pray hard enough, God
gives you the tools to your salvation.

39:14.041 --> 39:17.041
Carlos said his father left
for a waitress in El Paso.

39:18.208 --> 39:19.583
That's what he was told.

39:21.041 --> 39:24.542
All mothers know
they have to protect their children.

39:24.625 --> 39:28.000
But some of us take our job
more seriously than others.

39:28.125 --> 39:31.959
I don't know why you're telling me this.

39:33.333 --> 39:35.875
I think you do.

39:53.166 --> 39:55.417
OK. I know you're mad at me.

39:55.500 --> 39:58.166
I'm sorry I didn't stop you
going out with that guy.

39:58.250 --> 40:02.333
I'm not just mad at you.
I'm mostly mad at myself.

40:02.417 --> 40:05.917
- OK.
- I'm mad that I like you so much

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
without knowing anything about you.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.417
What do you want to know?

40:13.542 --> 40:17.125
- What's your favorite food?
- Mexican.

40:17.208 --> 40:19.583
- Favorite sport?
- Football.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.542
- Favorite band?
- Elvis Costello.

40:21.667 --> 40:24.500
- That's a guy, not a band.
- It's a guy with a band.

40:28.417 --> 40:30.542
What do you think of me?

40:52.959 --> 40:56.041
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

41:00.709 --> 41:04.000
- I don't want to talk about it.
- This is insane.

41:04.083 --> 41:08.458
- Do you even care about me?
- Do not talk that way.

41:17.750 --> 41:19.875
- Mrs. Van De Kamp.
- Hi, Zach.

41:19.959 --> 41:22.333
I wanted to see if
everything was all right.

41:22.417 --> 41:25.500
- Everything's fine.
- Are you sure?

41:25.583 --> 41:27.875
Yes.

41:27.959 --> 41:32.417
Well, OK. I'll see you tomorrow then.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.750
I'm sure that you will.

41:46.041 --> 41:51.583
<i>People by their very nature are always</i>
<i>on the lookout for intruders...</i>

41:53.125 --> 41:56.917
<i>trying to prevent those</i>
<i>on the outside from getting in.</i>

41:59.291 --> 42:02.709
<i>But there will always be those</i>
<i>who force their way into our lives,</i>

42:02.792 --> 42:06.917
<i>just as there will be those</i>
<i>we invite in.</i>

42:07.000 --> 42:09.208
Hi.

42:22.125 --> 42:24.500
<i>But the most troubling of all</i>

42:24.625 --> 42:28.375
<i>will be the ones</i>
<i>who stand on the outside looking in.</i>

42:30.583 --> 42:34.166
<i>The ones we never truly get to know.</i>
