00:53.889 --> 00:59.401
We had such, potential.
Such promise.

00:59.436 --> 01:04.858
But we squandered our gifts,
our intelligence.

01:05.419 --> 01:09.192
Our blind pursuit
of technology...

01:09.227 --> 01:13.491
only sped us quicker
to our doom.

01:15.911 --> 01:19.590
Our world is ending...

01:19.625 --> 01:23.269
but life must go on.

05:25.512 --> 05:29.182
Wait, I'm a friend.

05:38.399 --> 05:43.279
Yes. I always hoped...

05:47.400 --> 05:49.375
so much thought...

05:49.410 --> 05:53.373
The details, carved wood.

05:53.363 --> 05:56.039
Molded copper.

05:58.416 --> 06:00.460
You can't speak?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.426
Ah'ha...

06:12.430 --> 06:14.349
Come with me.

06:23.149 --> 06:26.236
Here. Stop!

06:29.203 --> 06:31.636
Some things in this world...

06:31.671 --> 06:34.702
are better left
where they lie.

06:34.786 --> 06:37.956
But if you know
where to look...

06:38.384 --> 06:42.096
these ruins are full of riches.

06:44.265 --> 06:46.100
Wait, wait.

06:46.392 --> 06:48.003
Almost there.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.384
Friend... friend?

06:52.419 --> 06:55.485
- Friend.
- Friend.

07:01.658 --> 07:04.410
What's this?

07:06.412 --> 07:09.582
You've found it.

07:09.874 --> 07:14.087
He's... uh,
he's always drawing this.

07:17.257 --> 07:19.968
Are... are we alone?

07:20.003 --> 07:21.845
No, no...

07:23.721 --> 07:25.265
Shh...

07:26.808 --> 07:29.060
Go.

07:34.107 --> 07:36.818
Get in the can, go on.

07:58.798 --> 08:00.300
Huh...

08:47.514 --> 08:48.848
Hey, hey, hey...

08:51.267 --> 08:54.062
Why don't you finish,
what you started...

08:54.097 --> 08:55.855
with me.

09:54.247 --> 09:56.583
No, no, no. No.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.259
It's alright.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.838
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:01.873 --> 10:05.133
You're safe now.

10:06.634 --> 10:08.726
Where am I?

10:08.761 --> 10:13.016
With us. I never expected
to see another one.

10:13.051 --> 10:15.441
There... that should hold.

10:15.476 --> 10:18.813
If Two were here, he would
have done a better job.

10:19.022 --> 10:22.108
- I wonder where he has gone to?
- I was with him.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.784
Two? Where, out there?

10:24.819 --> 10:28.114
- What did he...?
- Keeping secrets from me, I see?

10:28.149 --> 10:31.201
I was coming to tell you.

10:31.284 --> 10:32.917
What's this?

10:32.952 --> 10:37.248
I found him, in the emptiness.

10:37.373 --> 10:38.875
What were you doing out there?

10:38.910 --> 10:41.176
You know the beast.

10:41.211 --> 10:43.094
How many times have I told you?

10:43.129 --> 10:47.133
The Beast? That's what took Two.
If we hurry, we can save him.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.636
The beast took him?
That's the end of it.

10:49.671 --> 10:50.970
But he was still alive.

10:51.005 --> 10:53.389
No! We have rules!

11:00.813 --> 11:04.324
Our new guest seems confused.

11:04.359 --> 11:08.780
Perhaps I can help you
teach some clarity.

11:29.717 --> 11:34.347
- It didn't kill him?
- Quiet.

11:45.191 --> 11:48.278
Hold on.

12:28.651 --> 12:31.279
When we woke in this world...

12:31.314 --> 12:33.204
it was chaos.

12:33.239 --> 12:39.579
Man and machine, attacked
each other, with fire and metal.

12:50.006 --> 12:52.550
I found others.

12:56.596 --> 12:59.641
There's a gap ahead.

12:59.974 --> 13:02.769
Follow me.

14:12.422 --> 14:16.593
The gas...
killed, everything.

14:18.261 --> 14:20.200
I led us here...

14:20.235 --> 14:22.105
to sanctuary.

14:22.140 --> 14:25.518
And here we waited
for the war to end.

14:25.553 --> 14:28.935
Slowly the world, became silent.

14:28.970 --> 14:32.317
The only thing
that remains now...

14:32.352 --> 14:34.652
is the beast.

14:34.986 --> 14:37.078
So, we stay hidden...

14:37.113 --> 14:41.374
and we wait for it to...
to sleep.

14:41.409 --> 14:44.621
But where did it come from?
Why is it hunting us?

14:44.656 --> 14:46.671
Questions like that,
are pointless.

14:46.706 --> 14:50.293
We need to protect ourselves.
Keep ourselves out of danger.

14:50.328 --> 14:54.547
Too many of us
have already been lost.

14:55.590 --> 14:58.426
But he isn't lost.

14:58.468 --> 15:02.472
- Why aren't you listening to me?
- Two, chose his own path!

15:02.805 --> 15:07.018
I suggest you avoid
making the same mistake.

15:10.980 --> 15:12.947
Go to the watch tower...

15:12.982 --> 15:16.736
and take our guest, with you.

16:18.506 --> 16:21.593
This was the first thing
we built together.

16:22.093 --> 16:25.054
- We can still go after him?
- Us?

16:25.089 --> 16:28.016
But he could be anywhere
out there.

16:30.518 --> 16:33.445
Ah, that's where it took him.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.315
Down towards those
three tall shapes.

16:37.442 --> 16:41.738
Oh, no! We can't!
Not there.

16:41.773 --> 16:43.990
We have rules.

16:46.242 --> 16:50.622
- Why'd you listen to One?
- A group must have a leader.

16:50.657 --> 16:53.333
But what if he's wrong?

16:55.376 --> 16:57.844
Come with me.

16:57.879 --> 17:00.048
I can't do it alone.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.091
I...

17:03.218 --> 17:05.345
I... I can't.

17:05.386 --> 17:07.060
But...

17:07.096 --> 17:09.891
Wouldn't he have come for you?

17:24.571 --> 17:26.991
Wait.

17:31.621 --> 17:34.374
We're going to need a map.

17:35.083 --> 17:38.968
Actually, I don't mind having one eye.

17:39.003 --> 17:43.341
It's easier for me. I can concentrate
on one thing at a time. You know?

18:07.448 --> 18:10.285
Why was he out here alone?

18:28.887 --> 18:32.765
- Where's this tunnel?
- I don't know.

18:34.976 --> 18:37.395
Wait!

18:47.363 --> 18:50.325
We should go back.

18:51.784 --> 18:53.953
We can't.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.425
The, beast.

19:09.969 --> 19:12.222
It's too dark.

19:15.517 --> 19:18.436
We can use that.

19:47.006 --> 19:49.259
Wait.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.944
Two, would be impressed.

20:12.073 --> 20:14.617
We'll find him.

20:20.707 --> 20:25.628
You know, you're just like him. You
forget to remember, to be scared.

20:46.900 --> 20:49.694
Can I wait here?

21:05.793 --> 21:09.589
Why would he bring him here?

21:52.006 --> 21:54.634
Two!

21:56.553 --> 21:58.930
Two!

22:09.566 --> 22:12.360
I knew you would come.

22:12.443 --> 22:14.779
I thought...?

22:49.439 --> 22:52.650
Dirty thing.

23:40.865 --> 23:43.952
- Seven?
- I don't believe it.

23:55.296 --> 23:59.050
- You've come back.
- I never left.

23:59.217 --> 24:02.303
You've finally decided
to join the fight.

24:06.266 --> 24:08.893
You dropped this.

24:09.185 --> 24:10.693
Where have you been hiding?

24:10.728 --> 24:15.859
Rusty and hectic gathered,
shiny pile of scrap.

24:18.778 --> 24:20.572
Ohh...

24:23.783 --> 24:25.785
You did it, friend.

24:25.869 --> 24:28.079
I never thought...

24:47.932 --> 24:50.977
Wait. What're you doing?

24:51.227 --> 24:54.147
You don't even know
what it is.

25:07.619 --> 25:10.705
No! Two!

25:55.959 --> 25:58.628
Jump!

26:27.490 --> 26:30.243
Hurry, quick.

27:16.623 --> 27:18.791
What're you waiting for?

27:19.918 --> 27:21.544
Keep running.

27:22.045 --> 27:24.130
Come on.

27:44.776 --> 27:49.656
I knew we should't have come.
Why? Why did you do that?

27:49.697 --> 27:52.826
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

27:55.286 --> 27:57.497
I'm sorry.

28:00.875 --> 28:03.545
What were you thinking?

28:10.134 --> 28:13.012
What's it going to do?

28:13.179 --> 28:15.557
I know where we can
find answers.

29:26.628 --> 29:30.507
Is this, what it was like?

29:32.842 --> 29:35.845
Keep up.

30:01.037 --> 30:06.334
Oh, they've been here,
the whole time?

30:07.168 --> 30:09.295
Twins.

30:09.462 --> 30:12.924
They've been hiding here,
lost in the past.

30:12.959 --> 30:15.301
Looking for answers.

30:19.013 --> 30:21.391
They're cataloguing.

30:34.070 --> 30:35.620
We need your help.

30:35.655 --> 30:40.034
- We awakened, something.
- No, I awakened, something.

30:40.069 --> 30:42.871
Something terrible.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.881
That's it!

31:30.335 --> 31:33.171
Today, the, chancellor presented
the latest advancement...

31:33.206 --> 31:35.632
of technological wizardry
to the public.

31:35.715 --> 31:37.724
Comrades!

31:37.759 --> 31:40.011
Today begins a new era.

31:40.887 --> 31:44.015
Let us praise
this new technology.

31:45.058 --> 31:48.812
Welcome, to the age
of the machine.

31:48.937 --> 31:52.524
It will make new machines,
in it's own image.

31:52.559 --> 31:54.491
Machines of peace.

31:54.526 --> 31:57.445
Letting us know
the glorious new era...

31:57.480 --> 32:00.365
of wealth and prosperity
for the state.

32:09.207 --> 32:13.086
Governors are advised to pause,
for a public address.

32:14.462 --> 32:18.341
Science has turned
it's sinister eyes against us.

32:19.551 --> 32:21.886
People of our mighty state.

32:23.346 --> 32:28.643
Join me in repelling
the iron fist of the machine.

32:40.905 --> 32:44.200
But the thing that woke it,
it... it was round and...

32:44.235 --> 32:47.620
and engraved
with strange shapes.

32:51.499 --> 32:54.259
The shapes corresponded.

32:54.294 --> 32:57.797
It fit perfectly,
into the machine.

32:57.832 --> 33:00.592
I think it was made for it.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.511
That's what Six, always draws.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.103
Six?

33:05.138 --> 33:08.099
Two, collected his drawings.

33:08.134 --> 33:11.060
He was always studying them.

33:12.812 --> 33:15.523
- I have to see them.
- What?

33:15.558 --> 33:17.782
Go back to, One?

33:17.817 --> 33:21.946
So he can lock us away,
while this nightmare awakens?

33:22.155 --> 33:24.699
Never.

33:50.892 --> 33:53.895
Alright... alright,
where did he put them?

33:54.020 --> 33:56.230
Here somewhere.

33:56.265 --> 33:58.166
Here. Here.

33:58.201 --> 34:00.068
There they are.

34:00.103 --> 34:02.612
Right?

34:08.952 --> 34:11.788
You awakened, what?

34:11.822 --> 34:13.963
You fools.

34:13.998 --> 34:16.632
- I warned you.
- He warned you.

34:16.668 --> 34:19.719
Now you've awoke
unimaginable, terror.

34:19.754 --> 34:25.217
And may I ask, did you manage
to save, Two? Of course not.

34:25.253 --> 34:26.893
By following this wickless fool,

34:26.928 --> 34:29.312
you've endangered everything
we've worked for.

34:29.347 --> 34:33.143
- Why was Two sent out, to begin with?
- I sent him. To scout.

34:33.178 --> 34:34.484
That doesn't make any sense.

34:34.518 --> 34:37.543
You don't send
the oldest out to... Look...

34:37.578 --> 34:40.567
we need to figure out,
what's going on.

34:40.601 --> 34:44.362
The source... The source...

34:45.029 --> 34:49.242
Go back, to the source...

34:49.742 --> 34:53.246
This is it! This is what
wakened the machine.

34:54.289 --> 34:56.623
What do you know about this?

34:57.333 --> 34:59.843
Now you can't be trusted.

34:59.878 --> 35:02.589
I wont allow you,
to endanger us further.

35:02.624 --> 35:04.465
Subjugate them.

35:04.507 --> 35:07.760
- Sub... What?
- You illiterate crimp...

35:07.802 --> 35:10.013
Take their belongings.

35:13.683 --> 35:16.019
- Hey...
- Wait!

35:20.982 --> 35:24.736
You're nothing but a coward.

35:26.946 --> 35:29.164
How dare you challenge me?

35:29.199 --> 35:32.333
I, who kept everyone safe
all these years.

35:32.368 --> 35:35.914
Ever since you got here,
everything has been unravelling.

35:35.949 --> 35:38.381
You're a curse! A fool.

35:38.416 --> 35:42.587
- Guided by pointless queries.
- And you... are a blind man.

35:42.622 --> 35:45.256
Guided by fear.

35:48.927 --> 35:54.140
Sometimes fear...
is the appropriate response.

36:09.781 --> 36:12.075
No-o-o!...

36:22.627 --> 36:25.421
- Nine!
- Go!

36:36.891 --> 36:41.146
- Nine!
- Keep going, I'll find a way down.

37:25.982 --> 37:28.651
Come on.

38:24.541 --> 38:27.502
Let me try that again.

38:32.173 --> 38:35.844
The cable! Pull it!

38:48.898 --> 38:51.568
Grab on.

39:01.202 --> 39:03.746
Grab the wire.

39:19.012 --> 39:22.807
Your cape... let it go.

39:22.842 --> 39:24.993
I can't.

39:25.028 --> 39:27.145
Do it now!

39:43.620 --> 39:46.247
It's only a cape.

41:43.072 --> 41:46.576
There will be more,
wont there?

41:46.611 --> 41:49.162
Yes.

41:49.579 --> 41:51.894
It's not safe here.

41:51.929 --> 41:54.209
Stand look out.

41:58.922 --> 42:02.634
I'll search out a safer retreat.

43:18.334 --> 43:21.420
- What... what is it?
- The source.

43:21.455 --> 43:24.507
That thing
that woke the machine.

43:24.716 --> 43:27.802
- Go back, go back.
- Back to where?

43:27.837 --> 43:29.894
Dark science.

43:29.929 --> 43:34.309
What good does this useless
rubbish do us? Forget it!

43:34.344 --> 43:35.911
You know something.

43:35.946 --> 43:37.444
What do you know?

43:37.479 --> 43:40.607
I know enough, to leave their
ancient evil to moulder.

43:40.642 --> 43:43.085
Look what they've left us with.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.528
Leave it be I say.
But you...

43:45.563 --> 43:47.287
always asking questions.

43:47.322 --> 43:50.909
So many pointless questions...
Probing, pushing.

43:50.944 --> 43:54.621
Like, Two, he always
had to know, so much.

43:54.829 --> 43:57.624
I was right, you did
send him out to die.

43:57.659 --> 44:00.627
He was old, he was weak.

44:01.211 --> 44:05.256
Sometimes one must be sacrificed
for the good of many.

44:05.291 --> 44:08.176
You, coward!

44:10.094 --> 44:12.388
Seven.

44:26.236 --> 44:30.406
Your path
takes us to catastrophe.

44:36.454 --> 44:40.479
- We have to go back.
- Back? Where?

44:40.514 --> 44:44.504
To the first room,
where I woke.

45:39.142 --> 45:42.562
Can't he see, his way
only brings trouble...

45:42.597 --> 45:45.440
I mean what good
comes from his part?

45:47.317 --> 45:51.321
I know what we need, right now.
I know what's right.

45:51.356 --> 45:53.406
Huh?

45:54.449 --> 45:55.909
No.

46:02.040 --> 46:03.625
Huh...

46:15.386 --> 46:18.556
No, no, you can't be.

46:18.640 --> 46:21.267
No, no!

46:26.898 --> 46:28.900
Find them.

47:10.150 --> 47:12.485
Don't look in the eyes.

47:23.538 --> 47:26.332
Five!

47:47.729 --> 47:50.565
- Seven!
- Nine!

48:12.504 --> 48:15.256
- We have to go after them.
- What?

48:15.298 --> 48:19.260
- Eight? Wher... where's, Eight?
- That thing has them.

48:19.295 --> 48:21.971
It's taking them back
to the machine.

48:22.222 --> 48:24.557
Then it's too late.

48:24.682 --> 48:26.747
Wait, wait,
we have to get outta here.

48:26.782 --> 48:28.812
We must try to find
another safe place.

48:28.847 --> 48:30.278
No more hiding.

48:30.313 --> 48:33.942
We're going after them!
All of us.

48:34.025 --> 48:38.780
Need I remind you, on the outcome
of your last heroic venture?

48:52.085 --> 48:55.004
I can't let this
happen to them.

50:19.172 --> 50:22.967
- I'm going in.
- I'm coming with you.

50:23.009 --> 50:26.721
No... I need you here.

50:27.138 --> 50:29.891
If I don't make it back...

50:30.099 --> 50:33.186
destroy it.

50:36.689 --> 50:40.443
Wait, How?

50:50.203 --> 50:56.251
Come on, then. Let's hear it,
what's your... brilliant scheme?

50:57.794 --> 51:00.547
We'll need a full barrel.

52:07.739 --> 52:11.075
Hey! Over here!

52:57.664 --> 53:01.090
- Where are they?
- It's been too long.

53:01.125 --> 53:05.421
- We have to do it now!
- No, they need more time.

53:10.009 --> 53:12.595
Help me pull it down.

53:41.541 --> 53:45.295
- They're coming. They're coming!
- Help.

53:45.330 --> 53:47.881
Help.

53:48.923 --> 53:52.051
No! Not yet.

53:52.135 --> 53:56.764
- Let go, you fool.
- Five!

53:56.799 --> 53:58.892
We're coming!

53:58.927 --> 54:00.894
Now!

55:23.977 --> 55:26.646
Good riddance.

55:27.814 --> 55:30.400
It's done.

56:23.620 --> 56:26.331
Thank you.

57:29.561 --> 57:36.818
The machine, everybody!
The machine! It's still alive!

57:40.947 --> 57:43.158
No!

57:44.242 --> 57:47.162
There's nothing we can do.

57:50.790 --> 57:53.501
Help!

57:54.294 --> 57:58.089
Please! No, no!

57:58.590 --> 58:01.009
No!

58:10.685 --> 58:14.397
It's not.

58:17.025 --> 58:18.985
To the bridge!

58:27.410 --> 58:31.080
No! They're trapped!
They're trapped inside.

58:31.115 --> 58:34.542
Six, come on!
Get on the bridge.

58:52.727 --> 58:55.772
No, stop!
You mustn't destroy it.

58:55.807 --> 58:56.863
Get away, Six!

58:56.898 --> 58:59.108
You mustn't destroy it.
Don't destroy it.

58:59.143 --> 59:01.273
They're trapped,
they're trapped!

59:01.308 --> 59:03.404
They're inside,
they're inside!

59:16.543 --> 59:18.419
Come on.

59:23.508 --> 59:27.220
Go back, to the first room!

59:27.255 --> 59:30.932
He'll show you. The source.

59:49.450 --> 59:52.557
- It must be destroyed.
- No, no we can't.

59:52.592 --> 59:55.665
Didn't you hear him?
They're trapped inside.

59:55.700 --> 59:58.310
- We can still save them.
- What?

59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.920
- How?
- We have to find the source.

01:00:00.955 --> 01:00:03.173
It holds the answers.

01:00:04.424 --> 01:00:08.219
- We need to destroy it.
- But there's still a chance.

01:00:12.182 --> 01:00:15.310
We're out of time.

01:00:15.768 --> 01:00:17.068
Nine...

01:00:17.103 --> 01:00:19.689
they're gone.

01:00:20.482 --> 01:00:22.901
You are wrong.

01:00:23.401 --> 01:00:27.947
- Nine...
- Let him go.

01:01:30.552 --> 01:01:33.353
Greetings, Nine.

01:01:33.388 --> 01:01:37.649
It had such promise,
my great machine.

01:01:37.684 --> 01:01:41.646
It was meant to be
an instrument of progress.

01:01:41.938 --> 01:01:43.905
Of creation...

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:49.195
that was the agreement our,
chancellor failed to honour.

01:01:49.863 --> 01:01:54.200
But the fault is hardly
his alone to bear.

01:01:54.284 --> 01:01:58.955
The machine was born
purely of my intellect.

01:01:59.038 --> 01:02:04.259
Which I now know,
was not enough.

01:02:04.294 --> 01:02:09.924
My creation was hopelessly
flawed and indeed dangerous.

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:13.059
It lacked a human soul.

01:02:13.094 --> 01:02:17.515
And could easily be corrupted
by those who controlled it.

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:20.994
That is why,
I'm making each of you.

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:25.758
You're all that's left,
of humanity.

01:02:25.793 --> 01:02:30.487
You... are all the pieces
of my soul.

01:02:31.571 --> 01:02:37.118
Together, you and this device,
shall protect the future.

01:02:37.285 --> 01:02:44.042
Look closely and remember...
what you see.

01:04:12.964 --> 01:04:15.008
Fire!

01:04:15.425 --> 01:04:17.469
No!

01:04:26.811 --> 01:04:29.731
I now know the truth!

01:04:30.231 --> 01:04:32.365
The scientist.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.029
It's the scientist.
He's the source.

01:04:36.196 --> 01:04:38.531
He gave us his soul.

01:04:38.656 --> 01:04:41.868
We are him.

01:04:46.873 --> 01:04:48.798
Load the cannon.

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:52.086
Stop!
You'll destroy the talisman.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.299
It's too late.

01:05:33.044 --> 01:05:35.338
Quick, quick get in.

01:05:37.757 --> 01:05:40.260
We need to take the talisman
above the machine.

01:05:40.295 --> 01:05:43.103
It can be used against it.
Lower it to me.

01:05:43.138 --> 01:05:47.058
- Then you'll have a chance.
- Enough, Nine, don't do this.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.144
- What if you're wrong?
- I'll show you how to use it.

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:51.729
It'll be okay.

01:05:54.232 --> 01:05:56.568
This is the sequence.

01:06:32.937 --> 01:06:35.029
No!

01:06:35.064 --> 01:06:38.610
Please, we can't do this
without you.

01:06:39.736 --> 01:06:42.245
They all died because of me.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.742
I started this,
and now I need to finish it.

01:06:48.703 --> 01:06:50.914
They left us nothing.

01:06:50.949 --> 01:06:52.624
Nothing.

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:56.544
Why do we have to
right their wrongs?

01:06:56.711 --> 01:07:01.299
Sometimes,
one must be sacrificed.

01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:06.095
No!

01:08:13.872 --> 01:08:16.541
You did it.

01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:21.421
No... I didn't.

01:08:22.337 --> 01:08:24.090
Not yet.

01:08:36.227 --> 01:08:38.270
Photo log in.

01:11:19.265 --> 01:11:22.727
They're free now.

01:11:51.798 --> 01:11:54.676
What happens next?

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:57.519
I'm not sure, exactly.

01:11:57.554 --> 01:12:00.890
But this world is ours now.

01:12:01.224 --> 01:12:04.060
It's what we make of it.
