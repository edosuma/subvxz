"Robot Chicken y'all...,"

00:06.207 --> 00:07.471
Not enough of you have been

00:07.507 --> 00:09.509
calling in to support us getting
a third season,

00:09.544 --> 00:11.011
but we're gonna
change all that right now.

00:11.046 --> 00:12.103
Matt, give me the...

00:12.178 --> 00:13.839
Oh!
You shot the bloopers host!

00:13.913 --> 00:16.245
Seth, listen...
they like the violence.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.908
Oh!
We can't have a third season

00:18.985 --> 00:20.543
if we don't have any
writers!

00:20.620 --> 00:21.985
They love us!

00:22.055 --> 00:23.386
Violence!
Bleeding!

00:27.560 --> 00:28.549
Die!

00:29.362 --> 00:30.351
Die!

Ratings are through the roof,
bitches.

00:48.281 --> 00:49.475
We're fixing to renew y'all.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.312
That's what the fuck
I'm talking about!

00:51.384 --> 00:52.908
But at what cost?

00:52.986 --> 00:54.112
You say something, Keith?

00:54.187 --> 00:55.279
No, I didn't say anything.

00:55.355 --> 00:56.549
Aah!

00:56.623 --> 00:57.453
Gravy corn bread!

00:57.524 --> 00:59.253
Holy fucking ass crackers!

00:59.325 --> 01:00.223
Oh fuck.

01:00.293 --> 01:01.123
Come on, come on!

01:01.194 --> 01:02.252
Come on!

01:02.328 --> 01:04.592
Aaaaah!

01:05.832 --> 01:07.094
Dang it,
what do we do now?

01:07.167 --> 01:08.031
I've got an idea.

01:08.101 --> 01:09.125
Aah!
You rattlesnake!

01:09.202 --> 01:11.397
Aah! Ohh!

01:11.471 --> 01:12.529
Yes!

01:15.542 --> 01:16.941
N-o-o-o-o!

01:22.782 --> 01:24.113
N-o-o-o-o!

01:29.022 --> 01:29.989
Oh, wait a second.

01:30.056 --> 01:31.853
Oh, it's just mom.

01:42.535 --> 01:45.197
No!

01:46.639 --> 01:48.197
L-L-Look at the new contract!

01:48.274 --> 01:49.536
We get health benefits!

01:49.609 --> 01:52.442
Oh, no, god,
please don't eat my brains.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.747
It smells like
wet garbage in here.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.341
Yo, what do you guys want for
lunch today?

01:59.419 --> 02:00.750
Brains!

02:00.820 --> 02:01.980
Subway!

02:02.055 --> 02:02.987
Brains it is.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.614
Oh, I hate brains.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.325
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.729
Where all your fantasies will
come true!

02:10.764 --> 02:11.788
Then why are you a midget?

02:12.899 --> 02:14.517
Flash Gordon!

02:14.552 --> 02:16.101
The Phantom!

02:16.136 --> 02:17.635
Mandrake the Magician!

02:17.670 --> 02:20.373
These three heroes,
united by a quest for justice

02:20.408 --> 02:21.362
and the
coincidence that they're all

02:21.407 --> 02:22.533
owned by King Features
syndicate,

02:22.609 --> 02:26.340
now defend the Earth as the
defenders of the Earth!

02:26.412 --> 02:28.403
Earth!

02:32.785 --> 02:34.013
Wham! Ha ha!

02:34.087 --> 02:35.679
Take that!

02:35.755 --> 02:37.814
Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:37.891 --> 02:41.019
Watch me pull some kick-ass
out of my hat!

02:41.094 --> 02:43.324
Now you see me,
now you don't!

02:43.396 --> 02:46.365
Aah!
I actually live on this block!

02:46.432 --> 02:48.366
All:
Defenders of the Earth!

02:48.434 --> 02:50.026
Help!
Defenders of the Earth,

02:50.103 --> 02:52.469
a killer asteroid's about to
wipe us out!

02:53.973 --> 02:55.167
Uh...

02:55.241 --> 02:57.038
we're just the
neighborhood-watch association.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.203
The most bad-ass
neighborhood-watch association

02:59.279 --> 03:00.143
on the east side.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.145
Boo-yah!

03:01.214 --> 03:03.546
That whole Earth/asteroid
thing?

03:03.616 --> 03:04.878
Not really our bag.

03:04.951 --> 03:05.883
But look!

03:05.952 --> 03:08.147
There's a quarter in your ear!

03:09.389 --> 03:11.323
But you're the defenders of
the Earth.

03:11.391 --> 03:12.380
Well, part of the Earth...

03:12.458 --> 03:13.925
if you live on Brenner Drive

03:13.993 --> 03:16.154
between Wells Avenue and
Route 9W.

03:16.229 --> 03:17.457
To the cul-de-sac!

03:17.530 --> 03:19.327
All:
Defenders of the Earth!

03:19.399 --> 03:22.061
But... but... the... Earth...

03:28.675 --> 03:29.676
# Shout on #

03:29.711 --> 03:30.694
Damn light!

03:30.729 --> 03:31.643
# Shout off #

03:31.678 --> 03:32.679
Fucking television!

03:32.714 --> 03:33.645
# The shouter #

03:33.680 --> 03:35.511
Let's you turn anything on
and off from anywhere

03:35.582 --> 03:37.846
in the room with a high-volume
vocalization.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.248
Bullshit weather!

03:39.319 --> 03:41.344
Just plug it in to control
the lights, tv...

03:41.421 --> 03:42.410
almost anything.

03:42.488 --> 03:43.352
# Shout on #

03:43.423 --> 03:44.481
Ah, fucking Christmas!

03:44.557 --> 03:45.489
# Shout off #

03:45.558 --> 03:46.525
Kill myself!

03:46.593 --> 03:48.288
# Shout on, shout off #

03:48.361 --> 03:50.522
My kids left me alone to die!

03:50.597 --> 03:51.586
# The shouter #

03:51.664 --> 03:52.494
Whew!

03:52.565 --> 03:54.700
It'll be nice to have this
ultimate death ray finished.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.836
Let's just hope it doesn't
fall into the wrong hands.

03:56.871 --> 03:58.037
Good point.
Want to hit Quizno's?

03:58.072 --> 03:59.049
Word.

03:59.084 --> 04:00.027
Awesome.

04:01.741 --> 04:05.006
Megatron, the Ultimate Death Ray
is almost complete.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.342
Excellent, Soundwave.

04:07.413 --> 04:12.112
Now monitor their progress by
hiding in plain sight!

04:12.185 --> 04:15.211
Understood.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.482
Just let me grab my wallet.

04:16.555 --> 04:17.817
Oh, you'd forget your
testicles

04:17.890 --> 04:19.517
if they weren't tethered by the
Vas Deferens

04:19.591 --> 04:20.786
to your seminal vesicle.

04:21.761 --> 04:22.591
Hey, look at this thing.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.061
Who's got a boom box anymore?

04:24.130 --> 04:25.529
Hey, look at me!

04:25.598 --> 04:26.792
I'm LL Cool J, huh?

04:26.866 --> 04:27.798
Electric boogaloo!

04:27.867 --> 04:28.834
Chika-chika tam bam!

04:28.901 --> 04:30.095
Oh, what's that?

04:30.169 --> 04:32.535
Oh, my freakin' God,
it's a mix tape!

04:32.605 --> 04:33.697
Lame! Wow!

04:33.773 --> 04:35.001
Hey, what'd you do this summer?

04:35.074 --> 04:36.939
I totally cried my eyes out,
and then I masturbated.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.409
My God!

04:38.478 --> 04:40.639
Can you believe this actually
used to be a viable format?

04:40.713 --> 04:42.146
Look at me... streamers!

04:42.215 --> 04:43.045
I'm a clown!

04:43.116 --> 04:43.946
Happy birthday!

04:44.017 --> 04:44.949
Rumble!

04:45.018 --> 04:46.212
You're killing Rumble!

04:46.286 --> 04:48.777
If by "rumble" you mean "your
weak-ass mix tape

04:48.855 --> 04:51.255
of pussy pussness,"
then I guess we are.

04:51.324 --> 04:53.815
Rumble, transform!

04:53.893 --> 04:55.588
Transform!

04:55.662 --> 04:57.892
Oh, n-o-o-o-o-o!

04:57.964 --> 05:00.660
Hey, this thing runs on "D"
batteries.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.258
Just like your wife's vibrator.

05:03.336 --> 05:06.066
Soundwave hasn't reported
back in days.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.572
Where can he be?

05:07.640 --> 05:10.632
Megatron,
I think I found him.

05:10.710 --> 05:11.642
Ebay?

05:11.711 --> 05:14.509
Request permission to buy it
now.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.048
And good day to you.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.384
Breaking news from space.

05:24.457 --> 05:25.890
As the new ride at Las Vegas'

05:25.958 --> 05:27.255
"Star Trek: Experience"...

05:27.327 --> 05:28.294
What's up, Dickstain?

05:28.361 --> 05:29.623
Get out of here, Munson!

05:29.696 --> 05:30.594
I'm doing my show!

05:30.663 --> 05:31.493
Oh, yeah!

05:31.564 --> 05:32.656
What's it called again...

05:32.732 --> 05:34.893
"Gay news for homos about penis
who loves dick

05:34.967 --> 05:36.901
and are afraid of vagina and
grew up

05:36.969 --> 05:39.164
in west vagina and are kind
of afraid of it

05:39.238 --> 05:40.967
and also grew up in
"penis-braska"?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.338
No, it's called the
"gyro-robo news... "

05:43.409 --> 05:45.900
# Two scoops of penis are the
reason you're a superfag #

05:45.978 --> 05:46.808
Stop it!

05:46.879 --> 05:47.811
Oh ho!

05:47.880 --> 05:49.438
Now, tell the nice viewers

05:49.515 --> 05:52.416
how much you love the smell of
your own farts!

05:52.485 --> 05:53.315
Say it!

05:53.386 --> 05:54.478
Oh, it gets tighter!

05:54.554 --> 05:55.486
Say it!

05:55.555 --> 05:56.487
Okay, okay!

05:56.556 --> 05:58.183
I love the smell
of my own farts!

05:59.459 --> 06:00.756
I love farts!

06:00.827 --> 06:02.158
Ha ha! Loser!

06:02.228 --> 06:03.855
You got Munsoned!

06:05.198 --> 06:06.790
I'm your real dad!

06:09.569 --> 06:10.536
And in other news...

06:10.603 --> 06:11.535
Daniel, sweety...

06:11.604 --> 06:13.162
Mom, I am doing my show!

06:13.239 --> 06:16.037
Oh, well, it might be time
for a commercial break.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.167
No, it is not!

06:17.243 --> 06:19.871
I made Snickerdoodles.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.641
We'll be right back after
these messages.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.150
Alpha Psi Bodega?!

06:24.185 --> 06:25.249
Nuh-unh!

06:25.284 --> 06:26.819
Both:
Alpha Psi! Do or die!

06:26.854 --> 06:28.171
Gung ho!
Gung ho!

06:28.206 --> 06:29.454
Unh! Hunh! Unh! Hunh!

06:29.489 --> 06:31.116
Unh! Hunh! Unh! Hunh! Unh!

06:31.190 --> 06:33.090
Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:33.159 --> 06:36.458
So, uh... You like basketball?

06:36.596 --> 06:37.829
And now, Adam,

06:37.864 --> 06:40.733
it is unto ye to name all the
animals of the Earth.

06:40.768 --> 06:41.833
I'm on it.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.870
I'm gonna call you a horse.

06:43.905 --> 06:45.531
And you'll be a bear.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.004
Hey, Adam!

06:47.073 --> 06:48.472
Oh, hey, Steve.

06:48.541 --> 06:49.974
What are you doing?

06:50.042 --> 06:51.202
I walked into a situation, don't
know what's going on,

06:51.277 --> 06:52.574
but I want to be part of it!

06:52.645 --> 06:53.737
Eh, nothing.

06:53.813 --> 06:56.008
Just naming all the beasts of
the Earth.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.016
Ooh! Let's call that one a
peacock!

06:58.084 --> 06:59.142
Steve, Steve...

06:59.218 --> 07:01.118
And that'll be a swallow!

07:01.187 --> 07:02.745
Steve, please, don't...

07:02.822 --> 07:04.483
And that's the ramburglar!

07:05.792 --> 07:07.894
# Be a winner
at the game of life #

07:09.429 --> 07:11.397
A letter from the admissions
office?

07:11.432 --> 07:13.297
My life starts now!

07:14.901 --> 07:15.731
Rejected?

07:15.802 --> 07:16.928
Fiddlesticks!

07:17.003 --> 07:19.494
# Disappointment in the game
of life #

07:19.572 --> 07:20.664
That's the last tray

07:20.740 --> 07:23.072
of imitation meat patties
you'll ruin!

07:23.142 --> 07:24.404
You're fired!

07:24.477 --> 07:26.877
Isn't there anything I could
do to save my job?

07:28.781 --> 07:30.976
Yes.
There is.

07:33.419 --> 07:35.614
Oh, I really... need...

07:35.688 --> 07:36.848
this... job!

07:36.923 --> 07:37.855
Work it off!

07:37.924 --> 07:39.118
You're keeping your job!

07:39.192 --> 07:41.956
# Sex for favors in the game
of life #

07:42.028 --> 07:44.258
God, please...
Please...

07:46.132 --> 07:46.962
No!

07:47.033 --> 07:48.660
Oh, God, why?!

07:48.734 --> 07:50.929
# Broken condoms
in the game of life #

07:51.637 --> 07:52.797
Come on, honey.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.669
<i>One last big push.</i>

07:54.740 --> 07:56.037
Aa-a-a-a-h!

07:58.678 --> 08:00.270
Oh, shoot!

08:00.346 --> 08:03.213
# Start a family in the game
of life #

08:03.282 --> 08:05.546
God, another interview
you've blown?

08:05.618 --> 08:07.745
We can't all live on beer,
you know?

08:07.820 --> 08:13.224
You're gonna shut... your...
big... mouth... once... and...

08:13.292 --> 08:15.351
for... all... stupid... bitch!

08:15.428 --> 08:16.759
I'm sorry!

08:20.399 --> 08:22.799
# Kill your husband in the
game of life #

08:24.670 --> 08:25.967
Fucking spinner.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.576
Shh!
Shh!

08:36.182 --> 08:37.683
And now a message from your
Governor.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.950
Good evening.

08:38.985 --> 08:42.121
As you know, I have dealt with
many aliens in the past,

08:42.155 --> 08:46.057
but now you criticize me about
the Mexico alien.

08:46.125 --> 08:49.253
Here, I show you how the great
state of California

08:49.328 --> 08:51.728
has dealt with
the Mexico border issue.

08:51.797 --> 08:54.561
Here we have the high-tech
border fence

08:54.634 --> 08:56.727
with the highly trained
border guard,

08:56.802 --> 08:58.326
who will explain further.

08:58.404 --> 09:01.862
<i>People runnin' across the
border was a problem,</i>

09:01.941 --> 09:04.603
but these new systems are
impregnable.

09:04.677 --> 09:05.871
Eypa, eypa!
Landale, andale!

09:05.945 --> 09:06.775
Larriba, arriba!

09:06.846 --> 09:07.676
Ee-yah!

09:07.747 --> 09:09.612
S- s-son of a bitch.

09:09.682 --> 09:13.641
Cracking down on the crimes
will discourage the immigrants

09:13.719 --> 09:15.209
from coming here illegally.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.118
That's him!

09:16.188 --> 09:17.177
He drew a "Z" on my wall.

09:17.256 --> 09:19.349
Yes, right after I broke up a
robbery!

09:19.425 --> 09:20.892
I'm a fucking hero!

09:20.960 --> 09:22.291
Aah!
Chingo tu madre!

09:22.361 --> 09:25.159
We must stop the hiring of
the illegal aliens.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.256
I asked for this water
an hour ago!

09:27.333 --> 09:28.664
You are too slow!

09:28.734 --> 09:29.996
Slow?

09:30.069 --> 09:33.129
But mi nombre es
Slowpoke Rodriguez.

09:33.205 --> 09:36.641
You, the security people,
take the mouse and deport him!

09:36.709 --> 09:38.199
No, señor!

09:38.277 --> 09:40.575
They'll execute me in mi
country.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.079
You are killing me!

09:42.815 --> 09:45.841
You are killing me!

09:45.918 --> 09:47.943
But we are also compassionate

09:48.020 --> 09:50.580
for the children found at
the border.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.954
We found this little girl
wandering around

09:53.025 --> 09:54.492
with no parental supervision.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.551
Soy un explorer!

09:56.629 --> 10:01.862
Estoy en una adventura magnífico
con mi amigo boots!

10:01.934 --> 10:03.834
Which we dealt with per CDC
regulations.

10:04.971 --> 10:08.168
And here is the latest hero
to fight the illegal border crime

10:08.240 --> 10:09.935
Superman!

10:10.009 --> 10:11.033
Thank you, Governor.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.543
We super friends had no idea

10:12.612 --> 10:15.740
that El Dorado was an illegal
when we let him join our ranks.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.783
I'm on my way to deport him
right now.

10:17.850 --> 10:21.013
Yeah, yeah, good job with that
Superman thing going on there.

10:21.087 --> 10:25.888
And how did you come to this
great country yourself?

10:26.859 --> 10:27.791
Gott in himmel!

10:27.860 --> 10:28.918
Sir, if you have a moment,

10:28.995 --> 10:33.159
<i>I wanted to talk about how you
got into this country.</i>

10:33.232 --> 10:34.290
Up, up, and away!
