I'm just trying to tell you.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.764
Okay, I gotta go.
The WiFi-- Uh, Pam.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.499
Pam.

11:42.936 --> 11:46.607
-What was that about?
-Karen.

11:46.707 --> 11:47.875
More drama?

11:47.975 --> 11:50.944
Baby, we're not even going.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.747
Tell me.

11:56.483 --> 12:00.153
Mm-mm, mm-mm. You're gonna get
mad. I'm not.

12:00.254 --> 12:02.422
Why would I get mad?

12:04.258 --> 12:05.826
I could tell by the way
you just asked that.

12:05.926 --> 12:11.865
-Do you even know yourself?
-Uh, yes. I'm very self-aware.

12:11.965 --> 12:12.900
[Fatima] Just...

12:13.000 --> 12:14.468
-Ok.
-... tell me.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.005
All right.
Karen's in the hospital.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.506
For what?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.175
I don't know.
I'm here with you.

12:21.275 --> 12:22.843
But I'm pretty sure they're
gonna tell me something.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.778
Zac, is she okay?

12:24.878 --> 12:28.649
Yeah, I guess. Yeah. She was
bleeding or something, but--

12:28.749 --> 12:30.117
Seriously?

12:30.217 --> 12:32.419
Yes, that's what she said.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.021
All right, so do you need to go?

12:34.121 --> 12:35.756
What? No. Give me that foot.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.125
No, Zac. Seriously.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.393
No. I'm not going.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.428
I'm pretty sure she just
told Pam to call me.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.431
Like, come on. Come on.
Come on.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.667
And you're sure
you don't wanna go?

12:46.767 --> 12:51.238
Fatima, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm here with you.

12:52.072 --> 12:52.973
Okay.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.108
Give me your foot.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.547
Don't, don't do that.
Don't get quiet.

13:01.315 --> 13:03.851
Look, Zac, I know y'all have
been through a lot.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.986
And I don't want her hurting,
so if you need to go then--

13:06.086 --> 13:10.858
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.927
-Okay.
-I'm not. Dang.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.964
Zac, this could be your baby.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.366
It could also be
the preacher's baby.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.102
Why didn't she call him?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.904
Okay.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.906
Exactly. Plus her mother's
there and Pam is there.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.408
Relax, baby.
Come on.

13:28.509 --> 13:30.677
I'm trying to rub your feet
and then rub on something else.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.412
But apparently she didn't
call the preacher man,

13:32.513 --> 13:34.448
so babe, why don't you call
and tell him what's going on

13:34.548 --> 13:36.149
and maybe he can
go check on her.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.485
I'm not calling that fool.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.855
No, no. I'm putting
my foot down. No. Okay.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.423
We setting boundaries, right?

13:43.524 --> 13:46.994
I'm not trying to be cold
about this, okay?

13:47.094 --> 13:48.295
All right.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.663
But we setting boundaries,
right?

13:49.763 --> 13:51.064
I get it, I get it.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.067
Okay. We had a nice dinner.
I'm trying to have a nice night.

13:54.168 --> 13:56.370
Like, come on.

13:56.470 --> 13:58.739
Shoot.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.579
See that shit right there.
That's gonna ruin it.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.549
I'm gonna call her right now.
I'ma call her right now.

14:08.649 --> 14:10.417
Don't move.

14:18.859 --> 14:23.730
Hey, Deja. De-- 'cause you got
the music and that's--

14:23.830 --> 14:28.202
Deja. Thank you.
Yes, thank you, Deja.

14:28.302 --> 14:31.171
No, no. I don't need you to come
over, Deja.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.007
No, just keep the music down,
please.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.176
Yes, I'm fine. Yes.

14:36.276 --> 14:40.480
He's fine! Now turn
the damn music down. Bye!

14:44.251 --> 14:45.953
Shit.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.590
I'm telling you,
I'ma beat her ass.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.427
I don't know where
I ever thought that you

14:53.527 --> 14:54.962
don't lose your temper.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.430
I don't know where
that came from.

14:56.530 --> 14:58.498
You're so calm all the time.

14:58.599 --> 15:00.267
-Zac.
-You're calm.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.636
-I'm telling you.
-I see.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.839
Just cool, calm and collected.
It's cooltima.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.609
Zac, be quiet.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.979
Can we get back to our evening?

15:14.147 --> 15:16.617
-No.
-Yes.

15:22.856 --> 15:26.827
[music]

15:34.701 --> 15:38.238
-Hello?
-[Gary] Hey.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.875
- Hi .
-Thank you for today.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.977
[Andi] Thanks for calming down.

15:44.077 --> 15:48.382
Yeah.
Can I see you tonight?

15:48.482 --> 15:50.284
See me tonight?

15:50.384 --> 15:52.119
[Gary] Yeah.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.354
Gary...

15:54.454 --> 15:58.358
[Gary] Please. Come on.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.726
If you want to see me,

15:59.826 --> 16:02.095
I need you to do
something for me.

16:02.196 --> 16:03.564
Okay.

16:03.664 --> 16:09.303
I saw in a movie once
where a couple wrote a list

16:09.403 --> 16:12.339
of all the good traits
of their relationship

16:12.439 --> 16:14.441
on a piece of paper.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.276
Okay.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.279
[Andi] And then
on the other side,

16:19.379 --> 16:22.482
they wrote all the bad traits
of the relationship

16:22.583 --> 16:24.051
on a piece of paper.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.686
It's a great movie.

16:25.786 --> 16:27.654
[Gary] Are you serious?

16:27.754 --> 16:30.490
You do that
and you can come over.

16:30.591 --> 16:34.394
Okay. I'll-I'll-I'll do it.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.096
[Andi] Okay.
Make sure you make your list.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.899
I will.
Will you have yours?

16:38.999 --> 16:40.801
I've already made mine.

16:40.901 --> 16:42.402
[Gary] Oh, really?

16:42.503 --> 16:43.670
Yes.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.838
Well, how long is the bad side?

16:44.938 --> 16:47.074
[Andi] Just make your list,
okay?

16:47.174 --> 16:49.209
Okay. I'll bring my list.

16:49.309 --> 16:53.447
[Andi] Okay. Um, I have to go.
Danni's calling me.

16:53.547 --> 16:55.482
[Gary] All right. I'll see you
tonight at 8:00.

16:55.582 --> 16:59.419
Okay.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.622
Hey.

17:01.722 --> 17:03.757
-[Danni] Hey.
-I was just about to call you.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.192
-Well, me first.
-[Andi] What's up?

17:05.291 --> 17:08.829
Have you seen or talked
to Sabrina at all today?

17:08.929 --> 17:10.030
[Andi] No.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.432
Oh God, what's going
on with her?

17:12.532 --> 17:16.502
I was just about to ask you if
you saw or heard from Karen.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.005
[Danni] No.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.473
Well, I went to her shop
and she wasn't there,

17:19.573 --> 17:22.409
so I know something's up.
I just don't know what it is.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.944
Okay, but listen,
I was seeing this guy

17:25.045 --> 17:27.580
and he said that they were
investigating Sabrina.

17:27.681 --> 17:30.083
-What?
-[Danni] Yes.

17:30.184 --> 17:34.054
-For what?
-[Danni] The bank robbery.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.956
Are you kidding with
me right now or--

17:36.056 --> 17:38.525
I'm telling you.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.296
Andi, you don't think they
would arrest her, right?

17:42.396 --> 17:43.697
No way.

17:43.797 --> 17:46.834
[Danni] I don't know.
Do you have Maurice's number?

17:46.934 --> 17:48.869
I don't. No.

17:48.969 --> 17:50.838
All right.
Um, I know where he lives.

17:50.938 --> 17:52.072
I can just go over there.

17:52.172 --> 17:55.709
[Andi] Okay. No.
That's a bad idea.

17:55.809 --> 17:58.545
Danni, I'm sure Sabrina is fine.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.280
[Danni] I don't know.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.217
They have to know she wasn't
part of that robbery, right?

18:03.317 --> 18:04.284
That's not what I mean.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.620
I'm saying they
might hem her up.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.457
[Andi] Are you really saying
this to me right now?

18:10.557 --> 18:14.161
Well, can you just make some
calls or something?

18:14.261 --> 18:15.996
[Andi] Yeah, I can find
out what I know.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.431
All right.

18:17.531 --> 18:22.302
But I'm sure she's fine.
Yeah. I'm sure she's fine.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.439
[Danni] Okay.
Why do you sound like that?

18:25.539 --> 18:26.907
Like what?

18:27.007 --> 18:29.977
[Danni] Like all happy and shit?

18:30.077 --> 18:32.746
Danni, I am always happy,
for your information.

18:32.846 --> 18:34.414
No. Something's up.

18:34.515 --> 18:36.183
[Andi] Girl, I will let you
know what I find out, okay?

18:36.283 --> 18:37.918
Yeah, something's up. Okay.

18:38.018 --> 18:40.053
[Andi] Bye.

18:51.765 --> 18:54.902
-Hey.
-Oh, uh-uh.

18:55.002 --> 18:58.005
How in the hell did
you know she was here?

18:58.105 --> 18:59.373
Pam, don't worry about it.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.909
Wait a minute.
Did Zac call you?

19:02.009 --> 19:03.243
Zac?

19:03.343 --> 19:06.313
No, he wouldn't do that.

19:07.548 --> 19:08.615
Where is she?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.450
I don't know if you
want to go in there.

19:10.551 --> 19:13.086
-Pam, where is she?
-She's in a mood.

19:13.187 --> 19:14.821
Where is she?

19:14.922 --> 19:18.559
--, you like Snoopy.
You'll find her.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.562
-Thanks, Pam.
-See, I told ya.

19:21.662 --> 19:22.930
How'd you even know
to go that way?

19:23.030 --> 19:25.599
Going in the right direction?

19:28.969 --> 19:31.772
-[Aaron] Hey.
-Shit.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.440
Really, Karen?

19:33.540 --> 19:38.345
I'm sorry.
Did Pam call you?

19:38.445 --> 19:40.380
No.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.683
Then how'd you know I was here?

19:42.783 --> 19:44.117
Hey, are you okay?

19:44.218 --> 19:46.420
Yeah, I'm fine,
but how'd you know I was here?

19:46.520 --> 19:49.022
I got a text.
Don't worry about it.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.424
Who?

19:50.524 --> 19:53.160
Don't worry about it.
Listen, are you okay?

19:53.260 --> 19:55.295
From who, Aaron?
Nobody knows I'm here.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.930
Karen, come on.
It's not important.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.366
From who?

19:59.466 --> 20:01.802
Karen, can you just let me know
how you're doing?

20:01.902 --> 20:04.371
Can you stop stressing me out?
Just tell me who it was from.

20:04.471 --> 20:07.341
Look, I'm not looking
to stress you out, okay?

20:07.441 --> 20:11.245
Did Zac call you?
No. He wouldn't do that.

20:11.345 --> 20:12.713
Karen, come on, listen.

20:12.813 --> 20:16.617
Wait. Fatima got your number.

20:16.717 --> 20:18.519
She got all your numbers
because she works for Andi,

20:18.619 --> 20:19.853
so she's who.

20:19.953 --> 20:23.524
No, no, no. It wasn't Fatima.
Stop. What are you doing?

20:23.624 --> 20:25.425
Excuse me.

20:26.527 --> 20:28.262
[phone buzzing]
Will you stop it, babe?

20:28.362 --> 20:30.030
This is the best part.

20:30.130 --> 20:32.499
This is my favorite
part coming up.

20:35.102 --> 20:38.772
Stop. Look who's calling.
Stop it.

20:39.373 --> 20:40.641
-Who keeps calling?
-I don't know.

20:40.741 --> 20:42.409
Babe, it might be an emergency.
They keep calling.

20:42.509 --> 20:45.179
This is an emergency.
It's been a minute.

20:45.279 --> 20:47.281
[phone buzzing]

20:47.381 --> 20:48.782
Now your phone is ringing.

20:50.918 --> 20:51.985
Oh, hell no.

20:52.085 --> 20:52.986
Babe, it's Karen.

20:53.086 --> 20:53.954
I know, that's why--

20:54.054 --> 20:55.422
Answer it.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.924
No, do not answer that.
Don't.

20:57.024 --> 20:58.125
Answer it.

20:58.225 --> 20:59.993
I'm not answering it.
Let it ring.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.862
Fatima!

21:04.064 --> 21:06.900
-Hello.
-[Karen] Hi, Fatima.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.535
Yes?

21:08.635 --> 21:09.937
[Karen] I would appreciate it
if you would

21:10.037 --> 21:12.873
mind your -- business.

21:12.973 --> 21:14.441
Excuse me?

21:14.541 --> 21:16.310
[Karen] Yeah, calling around
town telling people

21:16.410 --> 21:17.945
I'm at the hospital.

21:18.045 --> 21:19.313
Zac, talk to this girl.

21:19.413 --> 21:21.114
[Karen] Nah, you a low-down
bitch for that.

21:21.215 --> 21:22.549
Hey, chill.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.085
And Zac, you know what?
I know that Pam called you.

21:25.185 --> 21:27.254
Yes, Karen.
Pam called me.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.089
You're not even gonna
ask me how I'm doing?

21:29.189 --> 21:31.625
[Zac] Damn, Karen .

21:31.725 --> 21:34.361
Okay, you know what?
Tell your bitch-

21:34.461 --> 21:36.029
Oh, I'm a bitch again?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.131
-Tell your bitch.
-Get your girl.

21:38.232 --> 21:39.566
-Stop! Chill!
-Don't be talking to Aaron

21:39.666 --> 21:41.201
and telling him
what's going on with me.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.603
That ain't none of her business.

21:42.703 --> 21:44.037
She didn't call Aaron.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.272
[Karen] And your bitch ass

21:45.372 --> 21:46.640
didn't even ask me
how I'm doing.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.775

It's lovely.

36:36.730 --> 36:37.664
So what's going on?

36:37.764 --> 36:41.435

37:21.108 --> 37:23.644
I don't know.

37:23.744 --> 37:26.013
Are you sure?

37:26.113 --> 37:30.250
Listen, if Sabrina calls you
or if you hear from Maurice,

37:30.350 --> 37:32.186
can you call me?

37:32.286 --> 37:34.254
Okay, now you're worrying me.

37:34.354 --> 37:36.924
So you really think
something's wrong?

37:37.024 --> 37:39.626
I had a friend who said they
were being investigated

37:39.726 --> 37:42.095
at the bank and now
no one's heard from them.

37:42.196 --> 37:45.098
-What?
-Yes.

37:45.199 --> 37:48.468
-Investigated?
-For the robbery.

37:48.569 --> 37:51.171
Really? Maurice and Sabrina?

37:51.271 --> 37:54.608
Yes. And you know how
these people can be.

37:54.708 --> 37:57.277
You're serious?

37:58.278 --> 38:03.650
All right. Here.
Put your number in my phone

38:03.750 --> 38:06.854

38:07.788 --> 38:10.023
Okay. Thank you.
And you'll call me, right?

38:10.123 --> 38:11.391
-I will.
-Okay.

38:11.491 --> 38:13.694
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

38:17.898 --> 38:19.600
[line ringing]

38:23.337 --> 38:25.906

38:26.006 --> 38:29.343

get this message. All right.

38:30.377 --> 38:32.646

38:44.391 --> 38:46.793
[knocking on door]

38:53.734 --> 38:55.502
Hey.

38:55.602 --> 38:57.070
What's up?

38:57.171 --> 38:59.540
How are you?

38:59.640 --> 39:01.441
I'm good.

39:01.542 --> 39:05.012
So what is it you want?

39:05.112 --> 39:07.214
I just wanna talk to Karen.

39:07.314 --> 39:10.050
Well, what do you want
to talk to her about?

39:12.452 --> 39:13.820
I just want to talk to her.

39:13.921 --> 39:18.158
Well, Zac. That's just
not gonna happen tonight.

39:18.258 --> 39:20.360
Ms. Lisa.

39:20.460 --> 39:23.764
Look, the doctor put her
on bed rest and she's sleeping.

39:23.864 --> 39:25.365
Okay.

39:25.465 --> 39:29.303
So what is it you need?

39:29.403 --> 39:30.904
Look, I got a new lady.

39:31.004 --> 39:33.073
Look, she can't be stressed out.

39:33.173 --> 39:36.510
And I heard about the new lady.

39:36.610 --> 39:38.545
I'm not here to
stress her out, okay?

39:38.645 --> 39:41.915
But I do got a new lady
and she called her,

39:42.015 --> 39:43.217
cussed her out,

39:43.317 --> 39:45.786
called her all sorts
of bitches and shit.

39:45.886 --> 39:49.523
Is she a bitch?

39:49.623 --> 39:52.826
No, she's not a bitch.
And I'm not having it, so--

39:52.926 --> 39:56.797
Then we are not having this
conversation tonight, okay?

39:56.897 --> 40:00.067
Okay, well...

40:00.400 --> 40:02.302
Well, what?

40:02.402 --> 40:03.637
Can you talk to her?

40:03.737 --> 40:06.773
-Can I talk to her?
-Yes. Can you talk to her?

40:06.874 --> 40:08.709
Because I done told her
I moved on,

40:08.809 --> 40:11.378
but she's not getting it.
I mean...

40:11.478 --> 40:12.946
Okay, I hear ya.

40:13.046 --> 40:15.415
All right, and if this baby
happens to be mine--

40:15.516 --> 40:17.417
Oh, Lord have mercy.

40:17.518 --> 40:22.489
Seriously, are you on
this baby train, too?

40:22.589 --> 40:25.092
With all due respect, Ms. Lisa.

40:25.192 --> 40:28.529
I ain't the only one
she's been with.

40:28.629 --> 40:29.663
Okay.

40:29.763 --> 40:34.368
So like I said,
if this baby is mine,

40:34.468 --> 40:36.036
we gonna have
to figure this shit out.

40:36.136 --> 40:42.109
Well, you're doing well, right?
So she'll be doing well.

40:42.209 --> 40:45.145
-Really?
-Yeah.

40:45.245 --> 40:49.650
So, look, why don't
you just go on home?

40:52.052 --> 40:54.588

41:02.796 --> 41:07.601

41:25.152 --> 41:26.486

41:48.675 --> 41:51.044

41:52.946 --> 41:55.716
And about Zac,
are you sure the baby's his?

41:55.816 --> 41:57.718
Sometimes I don't know anymore.

41:57.818 --> 41:59.853
Sabrina is not made for jail.

41:59.953 --> 42:01.922
She didn't commit this crime.

42:02.022 --> 42:03.624
They got her locked up anyway,
Andi.

42:03.724 --> 42:06.527
I have one more person
I could possibly call.

42:06.627 --> 42:08.295
Zac, I just wanted to talk
to you about Karen real quick.

42:08.395 --> 42:09.796
Zac, it must be important.

42:09.897 --> 42:11.265
It is.

42:11.365 --> 42:13.100

42:13.200 --> 42:14.334
