WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:02.956
[SCREAMING]

00:02.956 --> 00:04.371
We are WWE Divas.

00:04.371 --> 00:06.907
We are Broadway with body slams.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.609
I wanted to come
up here and ask

00:08.609 --> 00:10.310
for your blessing to marry Eva.
-You got a ring?

00:10.310 --> 00:11.645
So you're coming
over to my dad's house

00:11.645 --> 00:12.980
and telling him that you're
marrying his daughter?

00:12.980 --> 00:14.348
You know what?
No.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.649
Flat no!

00:15.649 --> 00:17.384
Will you make me the
luckiest man alive?

00:17.384 --> 00:18.185
Oh my gosh.

00:18.185 --> 00:18.986
Yes.

00:18.986 --> 00:21.722
Ladies and gentlemen,
my new fiance!

00:21.722 --> 00:23.090
[CHEERING]

00:23.090 --> 00:24.858
I have to admit,
doing all of this

00:24.858 --> 00:26.693
makes me want to be engaged.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.061
This is where this
gets difficult.

00:28.061 --> 00:31.265
Because I make all the
sacrifices and you make none.

00:31.265 --> 00:34.268
I won't get married again
and I won't have kids.

00:34.268 --> 00:38.372
Then I have to just
re-think things.

00:38.372 --> 00:43.243
TV ANNOUNCER: This is a
six Diva tag team bout.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.212

00:47.648 --> 00:49.583
Now Nikki and Brie to the ring.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.918
That's twin magic.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.085
The diva's division
has pretty much

00:52.085 --> 00:55.222
blown up from big matches
on Raw and SmackDown

00:55.222 --> 00:58.559
to competing in every
single pay-per-view.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.793
And I feel like I'm
hitting a totally

00:59.793 --> 01:01.662
different stride in my career.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.263
I'm actually scared
for the people

01:03.263 --> 01:04.364
that I have to
get in there with.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.766
Because if they don't
bring their A game,

01:05.766 --> 01:07.834
I'm going to eat them up.

Oh, yes, baby.

01:36.563 --> 01:39.533

Everybody ready for Tribute?

Sean and I are here to talk to
you today about some, you know.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.073
We got "Tribute to
the Troops" coming up.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.308
We don't know exactly who's
going to Afghanistan just yet.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.376
Two divas are going.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.144
As soon as I know,
I'll let you know.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.513
We got our first
ever five day TV run.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.115
We're all really
excited about that.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.250
Hopefully, we won't kill
each other by the end of it.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.285
Oh, pew!

01:58.285 --> 01:59.086
Summer?

01:59.086 --> 02:00.120
Yes.

02:00.120 --> 02:00.921
We have an idea.

02:00.921 --> 02:01.722
OK.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.757
You've been doing so great
on TV, all the matches.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.459
You're hitting everything
right on the head.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.827
Now you need to take
it to the next level.

02:06.827 --> 02:07.628
Thank you.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.062
We're going to have
you travel with Eva

02:09.062 --> 02:10.864
here because she's been out
there a little bit more.

02:10.864 --> 02:11.131
Great.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.799
So we're going to have you
guys start traveling together.

02:12.799 --> 02:13.367
OK?
-Cool.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.835
You know, this
opportunity is huge.

02:14.835 --> 02:15.636
Thank you.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.105
We think by pairing up with
Eva here, it can only help.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.473
You never know,
maybe do a tag team.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.841
You could take on the
lovely Bella twins

02:20.841 --> 02:21.975
here or The Funkadactyls.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.243
And some future ideas.
-Woo, woo!

02:23.243 --> 02:25.045
They would have to have
wrestling ability to do that.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.013
Right.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.981
Baby girl, that's right.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.149
Watch out for
Nattie because she

02:29.149 --> 02:30.350
wants to be the only blonde.
-Yes.

02:30.350 --> 02:30.651
I just sad that.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.952
So that's the only thing
we're going to say to you.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.553
Well, if she's a
real blonde, then

02:33.553 --> 02:34.788
that would be a thing but--

02:34.788 --> 02:36.189
-Whoa!
-Oh!

Hi, my name is Summer Rae.

out from developmental

are you guys with Summer Rae?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.835

02:55.442 --> 02:56.810
It's kind of like
"Beauty and the Beast."

02:56.810 --> 03:00.981
Being a WWE Diva
officially is amazing.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.482
I'm no longer a newbie.

03:02.482 --> 03:06.920
I get to perform
more, more TV time.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.988
I can't believe it.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.022
MARK CARRANO: Bellas, look out.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.058
Here they come for you.

03:11.058 --> 03:11.858
There you go.

03:11.858 --> 03:12.659
See you, guys.

03:12.659 --> 03:13.460
-Bye!
-Bye!

03:13.460 --> 03:14.261
MARK CARRANO: OK.

03:14.261 --> 03:15.328
Let's get to work everybody, OK?

03:15.328 --> 03:16.363
Bye, guys.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.066
The girls are
like vultures, man!

03:19.066 --> 03:21.201
Oh, I can only imagine
what they were saying.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.469
I didn't know why I
was going in there

03:22.469 --> 03:23.937
and I instantly felt tension.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.439
I've done nothing wrong to that.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.373
I've been beat on.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.075
No one's respectful
in the locker room.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.676
And now-- and why was
Nattie sassing me?

03:29.676 --> 03:30.444
I don't know.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.311
Nattie has a problem
with everybody.

03:31.311 --> 03:32.345
Yeah.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.181
And at the end of the day,
like, I know there's going

03:34.181 --> 03:36.650
to be drama, but if they
want us to ride together,

03:36.650 --> 03:37.451
I'll have your back.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.552
And I got-- I got yours.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.352
Yeah.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.188
Especially if you're
my new tag team partner.

03:41.188 --> 03:41.955
-Yeah.
-Absolutely.

03:41.955 --> 03:42.889
-Cool.
-All right.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.391
Let's start the chaos.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.227
[LAUGHING]

03:51.965 --> 03:53.266
What are we doing next, Brie?

03:53.266 --> 03:54.835
I know.
We need to think of something.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.236
Do we want to keep
doing, like, some type

03:56.236 --> 03:57.771
of print or something?

03:57.771 --> 03:59.673
I might want to
go into kick pads.

03:59.673 --> 04:00.540
What?

04:00.540 --> 04:02.175
No ruffles?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.410
Hey, girls.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.211
Hey, girl.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.011
What's up?

04:05.011 --> 04:08.582
Just here to see if my
new costume is ready.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.382
Hang on a second.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.084
Let me finish with her, OK?
-OK.

04:11.084 --> 04:11.918
I like you're stockings.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.186
Oh, thank you.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.020
Those are cute.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.522
Thanks.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.991
Oh my gosh, your ring!

04:17.991 --> 04:19.192
Did you add something?

04:19.192 --> 04:21.060
Um-- that one.

04:21.060 --> 04:21.862
Yeah.

04:21.862 --> 04:22.896
I was going to say-- this band.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.868
Did you elope?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.703
I am officially married.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.271
Jonathan and I eloped.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.707
I definitely didn't
want to be another girl

04:33.707 --> 04:36.243
that was engaged for four
years, like everybody else.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.377
Oh my god!

04:37.377 --> 04:38.512
So you're married
now, officially?

04:38.512 --> 04:40.347
Yeah.
I'm like officially married.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.148
No one knows.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.115
Not even my parents.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.216
Your parents don't know?

04:43.216 --> 04:44.417
Mm mm.

04:44.417 --> 04:47.954
Aren't they going to be so mad?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.589
Are you ever going
to tell them or no?

04:49.589 --> 04:51.158
I was just, like, not
going to say anything.

04:51.158 --> 04:51.958
Yeah.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.628
Except then you're starting
your marriage off with a lie.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.428
And then--

04:55.428 --> 04:56.730
What are you guys doing?

04:59.733 --> 05:00.600
What?

05:00.600 --> 05:01.535
Why'd you guys all weird.

05:01.535 --> 05:06.006
Look it-- Sandra, do you have,
um-- cleaner for my jersey?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.174
Oh, now-- no.

05:11.711 --> 05:12.746
You got freaking married?

05:12.746 --> 05:15.148
Wow.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.583
Oh my goodness.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.018
I guess this how my world is.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.687
Everyone around me
gets married and I'm

05:20.687 --> 05:22.889
separated from my boyfriend
right now because he

05:22.889 --> 05:25.058
doesn't want to get married.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.459
I can't believe you did that.

05:26.459 --> 05:27.260
Oh my gosh!

05:27.260 --> 05:28.061
Congratulations!

05:28.061 --> 05:29.496
-But Nicole--
-What?

05:29.496 --> 05:30.497
She didn't tell her parents.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.298
What?

05:31.298 --> 05:32.599
And they still don't know.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.600
They don't know anything.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.235
If you were my
daughter, Eva, and you

05:35.235 --> 05:39.139
went behind everybody's back, I
would be really upset with you.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.106
Damn, Sandra.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.308
I'm saying-- I'm a mom.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.109
I have a kids that are, as
a matter of fact, your age.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.744
And if they did
that behind my back,

05:44.744 --> 05:47.647
I would not
appreciate it at all.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.683
Yeah.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.684
You should say something--

05:50.684 --> 05:52.018
I know.
I didn't think like--

05:52.018 --> 05:53.854
Before you get deeper, and
deeper, and deeper into it.

05:57.624 --> 05:58.792
TV ANNOUNCER 1:
Welcome, everybody,

05:58.792 --> 06:01.361
to "Monday Night Raw."

06:01.361 --> 06:04.331
[CHEERING]

06:04.331 --> 06:05.232
Trin!

06:05.232 --> 06:06.132
Come here, real quick!

06:06.132 --> 06:07.601
We have to tell Trin.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.535
Tell Trin--

06:08.535 --> 06:09.870
I feel like I'm in trouble.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.637
You are.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.438
No.

06:11.438 --> 06:12.439
Um-- did you hear about Eva?

06:12.439 --> 06:13.340
No.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.975
She's married.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.209
-When did y'all find this out?
-She went--

06:16.209 --> 06:17.143
-She just told us.
-Right now.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.712
Mm!

06:18.712 --> 06:21.781
New in your career-- they
got engaged at two months.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.583
Mm.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.285
When you break up
with someone or you're

06:25.285 --> 06:27.821
on a break with someone, you
usually don't see them at work.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.756
Usually, that's when
you escape from them.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.225
I really haven't
been talking to John.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.362
I've been staying at my
mom's condo in San Diego.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.831
Seeing him all the time
makes it very difficult

06:37.831 --> 06:39.933
to try to get through this.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.401
Did you guys hear about Eva?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.202
No.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.003
What happened?

06:43.003 --> 06:44.604
She got married.

06:44.604 --> 06:45.472
Without telling anyone?

06:45.472 --> 06:46.273
Yeah.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.407
Eva's a brand new diva.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.475
She's a bombshell.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.644
She's WWE's Jessica Rabbit.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.980
Of course, Jonathan had to
lock Eva down after knowing

06:53.980 --> 06:55.415
her for less than a year.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.183
So that's what
Jonathan's been saying,

06:57.183 --> 06:58.251
why is my wife on Instagram?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.553
He's been saying it
since they met each other.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.589
By the way, I stopped

All of a sudden, I
have a text from John.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.116
Weird.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.718
(READING) Hello, Brie.
Happy birthday.

Please tell Nikki to
have a great evening

I wonder why he wouldn't text
her and why he texted me.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.761
Well, maybe he did.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.029
Probably not.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.031
Do I tell Nicole this?

08:18.031 --> 08:22.902
Or do I just keep this with me?

08:22.902 --> 08:23.870
Oh, hey.

Well, I wanted to tell
you that John texted me.

Oh, really?

What did he say?

08:28.541 --> 08:30.677
He said, tell Nicole to
have a happy birthday.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.179
And he said he couldn't
be here this evening.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.515
Well, I didn't get a text.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.150
John never texts Brie.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.885

that he's even texted her.

I thought it was a little weird
that he texted me and not you.

Why is he texting
Brie and not you?

about it at age four.

see that or want that.

she tries to put her hands

16:21.113 --> 16:21.881
Yup.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.853
I just wanted to
come by and say hi.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.425
It's really hard to
see John at work.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.161
It just makes
everything so confusing.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.097
I, obviously, want
marriage and I want kids.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.899
And he doesn't.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.701
I never realized that
this would be so hard.

16:43.870 --> 16:44.871
It's weird.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.253
You kind of have
a lot of stuff.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.254
Yeah.
I kind of live here.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.527
I'm the type of person--
like, I learn from my mistakes.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.662
Clearly, I made a huge
mistake the last time

17:09.662 --> 17:10.695
with the whole engagement.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.431
So I'm trying not to repeat it.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.634
And my family's
coming for a week.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.769
So I need to get
Jonathan's things

17:16.769 --> 17:18.838
out of the apartment ASAP.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.374
There has to be no
trace of you at all.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.442
It's super important to
me that this goes well.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.242
Got it.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.279
This needs to be all Eva.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.179
All Eva, the diva.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.915
No Jonathan at all.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.517
The last thing I want to
do is drop a big bomb.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.219
I have your back if you
think that's what's going

17:33.219 --> 17:34.654
to help you not be so stressed.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.323
My major concern is you are
so not even in your clear head

17:37.323 --> 17:38.257
right now.
-Yeah.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.659
I am.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

17:39.659 --> 17:43.229
I'm packing your bag
and I'm making it

17:43.229 --> 17:44.931
look like no one
lives her, but me.

17:44.931 --> 17:45.731
It's a lie.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.199
A lie is a lie, is
a lie, is a lie.

17:47.199 --> 17:48.434

17:48.434 --> 17:49.235
That's it.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.036

17:50.036 --> 17:52.438
I get that this whole family
thing is a weird thing for you.

17:52.438 --> 17:53.372
So I'm having your back on it.
-No.

17:53.372 --> 17:54.507
It's not a weird thing for me.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.841
It's clearly a
weird thing for you.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.043
It's not a weird thing for me.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.011
You saw how, like,
devastated everybody

17:59.011 --> 18:00.179
was when we got engaged.

18:00.179 --> 18:00.980
That you got engaged.

18:00.980 --> 18:01.981
That's ridiculous, sorry!

18:01.981 --> 18:03.015
Now I'm married.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.817
So you think that's going
to make everything better?

18:04.817 --> 18:05.685
OK.
My thing--

18:05.685 --> 18:06.686
Are you crazy?

18:06.686 --> 18:09.589
I feel extremely bad
that I'm making Jonathan

18:09.589 --> 18:11.857
go to a hotel and just
kind of like hideout,

18:11.857 --> 18:13.192
basically, until
I figure out what

18:13.192 --> 18:14.794
I'm going to do with my family.

18:14.794 --> 18:18.197
But I'm feeling like, OK,
this possibly could work.

18:18.197 --> 18:21.467
In my head, I'm thinking,
like, what is the easiest,

18:21.467 --> 18:26.539
best way to, like,
break the ice.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.841
And this is the best
way, for right now.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.681
What are we doing
about the car?

18:35.681 --> 18:37.149
What about the car?

18:37.149 --> 18:38.184

18:50.763 --> 18:51.564
All right.

me to go shopping

18:59.305 --> 19:01.574

I was like, heck yeah!

19:01.574 --> 19:04.710
But it's for registry
for their wedding.

-Third wheel.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.098
Well, welcome.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.034
I was so excited to hear
you loved the store.

19:28.034 --> 19:28.901
And congratulations.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.036
(TOGETHER) Oh, thank you.

19:30.036 --> 19:33.272
So let me show you a
couple of ideas that I had.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.241
This company gets their
yarn from a company

19:35.241 --> 19:38.377
that gets the scraps
of underwear companies.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.880
And they take the scrap,
re-grind it to make

19:40.880 --> 19:41.981
the yarns for the throws.

19:41.981 --> 19:42.782
Oh, that's awesome.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.582
Wow!

19:43.582 --> 19:45.951
You're going to have a
throw made out of underwear?

19:45.951 --> 19:48.387
These are salt and pepper
shakers made in San Francisco.

19:48.387 --> 19:49.422
These just came in.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.222
Oh my god!

19:50.222 --> 19:52.692
And it converts old mason
jars to drinking glasses.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.492
Oh!

19:53.492 --> 19:54.326
Those are awesome.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.495
So this is hand
forged oyster shuckers.

19:56.495 --> 19:57.296
Oh my gosh!

19:57.296 --> 19:58.698
-Made in the Carolinas.
-That is awesome.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.632
It's like a sculpture.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.134
Uh-- I didn't
realize that people

20:02.134 --> 20:03.502
registered at places like this.

20:03.502 --> 20:06.238
So I was thinking Crate &
Barrel, maybe Williams-Sonoma,

20:06.238 --> 20:09.508
but I-- I'm a little
confused where were at.

20:09.508 --> 20:10.443
Nicole, what do you think?

20:14.647 --> 20:15.481
We know you wouldn't.

20:19.618 --> 20:22.188
Oh, you think a place
with Louis Vuitton--

20:22.188 --> 20:23.889
is that where we
need to register?

20:23.889 --> 20:26.192
Yeah.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.861
All this wedding planning
is just so exciting to me

20:28.861 --> 20:30.696
and I don't want
it to go too fast.

20:30.696 --> 20:35.034
But it's hard because Nikki's
feeling the complete opposite.

20:35.034 --> 20:38.771
She's just not enjoying life
right now and she's not happy.

20:38.771 --> 20:39.939

something for John.

going to go from there.

That wasn't what?

32:39.444 --> 32:40.578
I didn't expect that.

32:40.578 --> 32:43.314

They're already married.

really serious telling me

before Thanksgiving.

I don't like being
second fiddle either.

33:22.420 --> 33:25.857
I guess the question would be,
is how come we didn't know?

Obviously, it really didn't
matter what we had to say,

33:29.861 --> 33:32.530

anything like that.

envisioned telling my family.

bond with my dad

40:41.425 --> 40:42.793
It's done!

40:42.793 --> 40:45.229
I'm a 29-year-old, grown woman.

40:45.229 --> 40:46.497
I love this man.

40:46.497 --> 40:48.666
I want to spend the rest
of my life with him.

40:48.666 --> 40:51.769
And if my family can't accept
that, then that's on them.

40:51.769 --> 40:53.070
But at least I said my peace.

40:56.507 --> 40:57.875
Thanks for coming out.

40:57.875 --> 40:58.776
It was a great talk.

41:06.150 --> 41:08.385
John wants to
take me to dinner.

41:08.385 --> 41:10.988
He's coming here on a jet.

41:10.988 --> 41:13.524
Is it-- does he have
a surprise for me?

41:13.524 --> 41:16.060
Maybe he is going to propose.

41:16.060 --> 41:18.228
I still can't get out of my head
the things that he-- he said,

41:18.228 --> 41:19.029
you know?

41:19.029 --> 41:23.033
Like, the things that
he was so stern about.

41:23.033 --> 41:25.069
I don't know what
to think because I

41:25.069 --> 41:26.503
don't know what
he's going to say

41:26.503 --> 41:28.305
or what's going to happen next.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.650
[MUSIC PLAYING]

42:09.747 --> 42:10.547
Well, I'm here.

42:15.352 --> 42:17.421
BRIE: This season
on "Total Divas"--

42:17.421 --> 42:18.222
Brie!

42:18.222 --> 42:19.189
It's all red!

42:19.189 --> 42:19.990
Everything!

42:19.990 --> 42:21.125
Oh!

42:21.125 --> 42:21.992
I love my kitty cat!

42:21.992 --> 42:23.594
Has anybody seen Nattie's--

42:23.594 --> 42:24.928
[CAT MEOWING]

42:24.928 --> 42:26.263
[CHEERING]

42:26.263 --> 42:27.798
She doesn't know
what doggy style is.

42:27.798 --> 42:28.599
Nattie!

42:28.599 --> 42:29.933
You better work!

42:29.933 --> 42:30.801
Ah!

42:30.801 --> 42:33.037
Have you ever slept
with anybody at work?

42:33.037 --> 42:34.505
Oh!

42:34.505 --> 42:37.274
No one at work is supposed
to know that at all!

42:37.274 --> 42:38.175
[GASPING]

42:38.175 --> 42:40.577
No erections on
the bus, you guys!

42:40.577 --> 42:43.047
You were trying to
have sex on my bus.

42:43.047 --> 42:43.947
Yes.

42:43.947 --> 42:44.748
No!

42:44.748 --> 42:45.916
No.

42:45.916 --> 42:46.884
Oh my goodness!

42:46.884 --> 42:47.851
Oh my god!

42:47.851 --> 42:48.652
Beautiful!

42:48.652 --> 42:50.587
Welcome to Maui.

42:50.587 --> 42:52.423
Aloha!

42:52.423 --> 42:53.557
We have to decide
how we're going

42:53.557 --> 42:55.626
to kiss on our wedding day.

42:55.626 --> 42:56.427
Bryan!

42:56.427 --> 42:57.661
New rule.

42:57.661 --> 42:59.797
Anytime we're in the
gym, no wedding talk.

42:59.797 --> 43:01.432
I still think
that's a lot of poop.

43:01.432 --> 43:03.600
You can just [BLEEP] off
being my maid of honor, Nicole.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.602
One of the girls was showing
me some pictures of you.

43:05.602 --> 43:06.437
That's not a swimsuit!

43:06.437 --> 43:07.638
That's a freaking Band-Aid.

43:07.638 --> 43:08.439
That's like malicious.

43:08.439 --> 43:09.807
I found those
pictures on Twitter.

43:09.807 --> 43:11.175
So you need to relax.

43:11.175 --> 43:13.043
I think that girl will
try to bury you alive.

43:13.043 --> 43:14.812
Do you think that I'm going
to, like, out shine you?

43:14.812 --> 43:16.580
I can dye my hard red
and look hotter than you.

43:16.580 --> 43:18.048
Sometimes you need to
shut up, just the way

43:18.048 --> 43:18.982
those legs need to shut.

43:18.982 --> 43:20.884
You guys don't have to like
each other, but just as long

43:20.884 --> 43:22.953
as we keep it professional--

43:22.953 --> 43:24.321
Oh!

43:24.321 --> 43:25.255
[CHEERING]

43:25.255 --> 43:26.190
TV ANNOUNCER 1: Oh!

43:26.190 --> 43:27.391
She has to have surgery.

43:27.391 --> 43:28.792
And people think this is easy.

43:28.792 --> 43:30.127
They have no idea.

43:30.127 --> 43:30.928
Oh my god.

43:30.928 --> 43:32.463
There's something
drastically wrong with you.

43:32.463 --> 43:34.832
I talked to the doctor
and I, potentially,

43:34.832 --> 43:35.833
could not have kids.

43:35.833 --> 43:38.769
My world is collapsing
before my eyes.

43:38.769 --> 43:40.404
You are such a hypocrite.

43:40.404 --> 43:42.272
