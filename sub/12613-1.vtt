where our ancient ones are,

01:12:29.625 --> 01:12:33.082
the ones that first heard
the land crying and sent a man.

01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:34.915
His name was also Paikea...

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:40.332
...and I'm his most recent descendant.

01:12:43.166 --> 01:12:46.082
But I was not the leader
my grandfather was expecting

01:12:46.166 --> 01:12:50.665
And by being born, I broke the line
back to the ancient ones.

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:55.290
It wasn't anybody's fault.
It just happened.

(WHALE SONG)

01:14:08.625 --> 01:14:12.207
But we can learn, and if the knowledge
is given to everyone,

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.249
then we can have lots of leaders.

01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:16.415
And soon everyone will be strong,

01:14:16.458 --> 01:14:18.957
not just the ones
that have been chosen.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.957
Because sometimes,
even if you're the leader

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.707
and you need to be strong,

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.332
you can get tired...

01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:33.165
...like our ancestor Paikea,

01:14:33.208 --> 01:14:36.624
when he was lost at sea
and he couldn't find the land

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:38.415
and he probably wanted to die,

01:14:38.458 --> 01:14:41.249
but he knew the ancient ones
were there for him.

01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:44.999
So he called to them to lift
him up and give him strength.

01:14:45.083 --> 01:14:48.790
This is his chant.
I dedicate it to my grandfather.

he can sleep in the road.
