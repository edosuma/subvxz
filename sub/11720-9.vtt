Huddle, huddle, huddle!

00:47.677 --> 00:48.993
Hey!
Hey!

00:48.995 --> 00:50.828
Hut, hut!

00:55.334 --> 00:58.169
I just want to thank my hands
for being so awesome.

00:58.171 --> 01:00.472
Nice catch, Captain.
Thank you.

01:01.157 --> 01:02.641
Why is he here?

01:02.643 --> 01:05.193
I mean, uh, his family's all
in Chicago.

01:05.194 --> 01:06.428
He had no place to go.

01:06.430 --> 01:08.647
So you invited him
to a family football game?

01:08.649 --> 01:09.085
Yeah.

01:09.086 --> 01:11.385
Oh. Look, I understand you guys
had a bonding moment,

01:11.387 --> 01:12.553
but you're aware that
that's the guy

01:12.555 --> 01:13.754
that ratted you out
to the governor?

01:13.756 --> 01:15.205
I'm just reminding you.

01:15.207 --> 01:16.690
I mean, it's Thanksgiving, okay?

01:16.692 --> 01:18.125
I mean,
call me the bigger man.

01:18.127 --> 01:19.643
They're waiting for you.
Come on, let's huddle!

01:19.645 --> 01:20.878
Come on, guys.
Let's bring it in.

01:20.880 --> 01:21.896
Huddle, huddle!

01:21.898 --> 01:23.514
42-35, our favor.
Come on, guys. Let's bring it in.

01:23.516 --> 01:25.266
Listen, we hold 'em here,
the game's ours.

01:25.268 --> 01:27.434
All right, now we got 'em.
This is the play.

01:27.436 --> 01:29.937
Danny, I want you to line
up on my right, run a post,

01:29.939 --> 01:32.823
you two line up on either side of me.
I want you to cross...

01:32.825 --> 01:35.359
Just-Just give me the ball.
I'll get it into the end zone.

01:35.361 --> 01:36.894
The only way you're
getting the ball

01:36.896 --> 01:39.246
is if you got a jet pack
up your culi, okay?

01:39.248 --> 01:41.615
On three-- defense!
One, two, three.

01:41.617 --> 01:43.217
Defense!
All right!

01:43.219 --> 01:45.119
You know you're giving
the ball to me.

01:45.121 --> 01:47.922
Let's go. Come on.
Easy six!

01:47.924 --> 01:50.124
Here we go. Here we go.
Ready?

01:50.859 --> 01:54.077
Set... hut!

02:06.592 --> 02:09.727
Please! No, no, no.
Mr. All-State QB. We're all tied up.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.730
Next touchdown wins.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.566
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.234
That's it I gotta go.
Whoa, whoa, go where?

02:17.236 --> 02:18.702
Go where?
What are you talking about?

02:18.704 --> 02:20.604
I gotta, I gotta put
the turkey in the oven.

02:20.606 --> 02:22.439
Oh-oh! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

02:22.441 --> 02:23.908
You want to eat today or what?

02:23.910 --> 02:26.293
Oh! Have Mary put the thing
in the thing.

02:26.295 --> 02:28.245
What are you doing?
Mary's the prep cook.

02:28.247 --> 02:30.447
What are you all looking
at me for?

02:30.449 --> 02:32.115
The prep cook doesn't get
to stuff the turkey, okay?

02:32.117 --> 02:33.283
This is my operation.
Oh, come on, are you serious?

02:33.285 --> 02:35.302
This is unbelievable.
We got a game here.

02:35.304 --> 02:37.504
I'll be back in ten minutes!

02:44.512 --> 02:46.463
What the hell?

02:47.899 --> 02:48.899
It didn't thaw.

02:48.901 --> 02:49.967
What?!

02:49.969 --> 02:52.069
I know, I know.

02:52.071 --> 02:53.404
Did you take it out

02:53.406 --> 02:54.972
of the freezer last night?
Yeah.

02:54.974 --> 02:56.240
And you put it
in cold water?

02:56.242 --> 02:58.692
Yeah. For sure.

02:58.694 --> 03:01.478
Did you put it in cold water?

03:01.480 --> 03:02.813
No.

03:02.815 --> 03:05.916
No, I-I completely
forgot.

03:05.918 --> 03:07.751
Please don't be mad.
Please.

03:07.753 --> 03:09.152
You know what?
I knew something like this

03:09.154 --> 03:10.487
would happen if I made you
my prep cook.

03:10.489 --> 03:12.623
Well, then why'd you make me
your prep cook

03:12.625 --> 03:14.091
if you knew this was
gonna happen?

03:14.093 --> 03:16.660
You forced me to make you
my prep cook. You told me

03:16.662 --> 03:18.128
that mashing potatoes
wasn't enough responsibility.

03:18.130 --> 03:19.162
You wanted more
responsibility.

03:19.164 --> 03:20.881
And I made you
my prep cook.

03:20.883 --> 03:21.882
You're right.

03:23.019 --> 03:24.652
Okay, but listen.
I'm sorry.

03:24.654 --> 03:26.503
Joan was so fussy last night.

03:26.505 --> 03:28.355
I couldn't-I couldn't
get her down.

03:28.357 --> 03:29.523
And I apologize.

03:29.525 --> 03:31.058
Yes, I'm coming!

03:31.060 --> 03:32.893
Okay, uh, do me a favor.

03:32.895 --> 03:34.678
Put the oven on,
get the sides started.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.980
And I'll-I'll figure
something out.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.205
Happy Thanksgiving!

03:45.207 --> 03:46.240
Aunt Deb?

03:46.242 --> 03:48.959
Come here and give me a hug.

03:49.962 --> 03:52.362
What are you doing here?

03:52.364 --> 03:54.615
Well, it's been years
since I've seen you,

03:54.617 --> 03:56.700
and I figured it's
high time

03:56.702 --> 03:57.968
I paid you a visit.

03:57.970 --> 03:59.169
You look fantastic.

03:59.171 --> 04:01.672
Well, look at you.
Let me see...

04:01.674 --> 04:02.706
Whoa-oa-oa-oa.
What?

04:02.708 --> 04:04.008
What do you got?

04:04.010 --> 04:05.320
I see a little little gray
fleck right there.

04:05.321 --> 04:06.801
Oh, yeah, a little bit.
You like that?

04:07.212 --> 04:08.362
Yeah, yeah, I like it.

04:08.364 --> 04:10.014
I think it makes you
look very distinguished.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.766
Thank you very much.
Yeah.

04:12.768 --> 04:14.234
The tattoos not so much.

04:14.236 --> 04:16.487
Aunt Deb?

04:16.488 --> 04:18.772
Oh! It's Mary
and her little lamb.

04:18.774 --> 04:19.990
Oh, honey! Oh!

04:19.992 --> 04:22.225
I didn't know
you were coming.

04:22.227 --> 04:23.610
Did you know
she was coming?

04:23.612 --> 04:25.562
No, I had no idea.

04:25.564 --> 04:28.582
Oh, it's so great
to see you guys.

04:28.584 --> 04:30.084
Well, come on.
Let's sit down.

04:30.086 --> 04:31.869
Aunt Deb, we'd love to,
but we're in

04:31.871 --> 04:33.754
the middle
of a culinary crisis right now.

04:33.756 --> 04:36.373
What's that?
We, um, screwed up the turkey.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.741
It's still frozen.

04:37.743 --> 04:39.343
"We."

04:39.345 --> 04:40.711
Well, then I got here
just in time.

04:40.713 --> 04:43.464
McGarrett. Yeah, okay,
I'm on the way. I gotta go.

04:43.466 --> 04:45.215
What, you're leaving already?

04:45.217 --> 04:46.934
It's work. I gotta go. Listen,

04:46.936 --> 04:48.268
can you handle
the bird, please?

04:48.270 --> 04:50.938
Are you kidding?
We got it covered. Go. Go.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.306
I want constant updates,
though.

04:52.308 --> 04:54.441
All right?
All right, okay, go, go.

04:58.546 --> 05:01.031
So, what are the odds of me
actually eating turkey today?

05:01.033 --> 05:02.599
What do I got,
a 10% chance? 20%?

05:02.601 --> 05:04.485
Will you relax, okay?
My Aunt Deb is there.

05:04.487 --> 05:05.786
She's gonna figure
everything out.

05:05.788 --> 05:08.453
Oh, your Aunt Deb.
Your father's sister.

05:08.532 --> 05:11.130
The one who took care of Mary
after your mother faked her death?

05:11.294 --> 05:12.260
There's something
seriously wrong

05:12.262 --> 05:13.595
with you, you know that?
Me?

05:13.597 --> 05:14.963
You like reminding
me of that?

05:14.965 --> 05:16.732
Why would you like
reminding me of that?

05:16.734 --> 05:18.967
It's the truth.
Yes, it's the truth. Yes, it's the truth.

05:18.969 --> 05:20.485
Aunt Deb who raised Mary
all by herself.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.020
That must have
been trying.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.488
You don't know
the half of it.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.990
She walked away
from a record deal

05:24.992 --> 05:27.308
when that kid got thrown
in her lap, you know that?

05:27.310 --> 05:29.194
She was a singer?
You didn't know that?

05:29.196 --> 05:30.812
I did not.
Yeah, she struggled

05:30.814 --> 05:32.414
as a backup singer for 20 years,

05:32.416 --> 05:35.033
and she finally got a big break,
but she walked away from it

05:35.035 --> 05:36.835
as soon as Mary came
into the picture.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.370
Just like that, huh?
Just like that.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.506
She knew she couldn't raise a kid
if she was gonna be on the road

05:41.508 --> 05:42.674
half the year,
so she quit.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.992
She became a singing
coach instead.

05:43.994 --> 05:45.660
Oh, ah, Catherine.
Yeah?

05:45.662 --> 05:46.762
Hey.
What's up?

05:46.764 --> 05:48.296
All right,
here's what we know:

05:48.298 --> 05:51.183
so, a four-man crew was out
trolling for some skipjack

05:51.185 --> 05:53.919
when they hooked this.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.805
Huh. 45-gallon barrel.
That's not your usual bycatch.

05:56.807 --> 05:59.357
Let me guess.
There's a-a body in here.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.559
Just take a look.

06:01.343 --> 06:02.561
All right.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.315
Oh, no.

06:07.317 --> 06:08.934
Where's the rest of him?

Oh, yeah? Can I have some?
What is it?

07:22.916 --> 07:25.482
I don't know. I just,
I really feel like

07:25.484 --> 07:26.784
I'm in over my head.

07:26.786 --> 07:29.587
Did you ever feel
like that with me?

07:29.589 --> 07:31.655
Always.
Really?

07:31.657 --> 07:33.291
So I'm guessing I didn't
make life very easy for you.

07:33.293 --> 07:35.676
Well, let me
put it this way.

07:35.678 --> 07:37.661
You had your moments.

07:37.663 --> 07:39.347
How'd you do it, Deb?
Huh?

07:39.349 --> 07:40.631
I mean, I feel like

07:40.633 --> 07:42.666
I have no clue what I'm doing.

07:42.668 --> 07:44.185
You think I did?

07:44.187 --> 07:46.270
Oh, honey, I-I was winging it
the whole time.

07:46.272 --> 07:48.339
And it-it was scary.

07:48.341 --> 07:52.310
Being a mom is the hardest job
in whole wide world.

07:52.312 --> 07:55.980
But, you know,
I can't think of anybody

07:55.982 --> 07:58.065
who's better suited
for it than you.

07:58.067 --> 07:59.233
You got a big heart.

07:59.235 --> 08:01.369
You're smart.
All you have to do

08:01.371 --> 08:04.956
is love her with everything you got
and you're gonna be fine.

08:04.958 --> 08:06.523
Hey, sweetie.

08:07.826 --> 08:09.877
Okay, here we are.

08:09.879 --> 08:11.212
Oh, you're kidding.

08:11.214 --> 08:13.030
That's the best you got?
The runt of the litter?

08:13.032 --> 08:15.049
Hey, next time plan ahead.

08:15.051 --> 08:18.719
Thank you for that sage advice.

08:20.722 --> 08:22.723
<i>What are you saying, cuz?</i>

08:22.725 --> 08:25.760
<i>I'm saying it's over.</i>

08:25.762 --> 08:28.312
After we got back from
Tokyo, we took down

08:28.314 --> 08:30.348
the rest of Michael Noshimuri's
allies.

08:30.350 --> 08:33.351
That faction's gone, Kono.

08:33.352 --> 08:34.268
They're finished.

08:37.774 --> 08:39.690
Oh, wow.

08:39.692 --> 08:41.442
Any closer to finding Adam?

08:41.443 --> 08:44.779
Um, from what I've been able
to piece together,

08:44.781 --> 08:46.697
I think he may be in Seattle.

08:46.699 --> 08:49.066
So I'm flying there today.

08:49.068 --> 08:51.118
Okay. It's gonna be easier
for you to move around

08:51.120 --> 08:52.703
now that you don't have
to look over your shoulder.

08:52.705 --> 08:55.289
Yeah.
So I guess that means

08:55.291 --> 08:57.775
you'll be spending Thanksgiving
at 30,000 feet.

08:57.777 --> 09:00.244
Table's gonna feel empty
without you.

09:00.246 --> 09:02.413
I'll be there next year.

09:02.415 --> 09:03.931
I promise.

09:03.933 --> 09:06.250
Hey, look, I should get going.

09:06.252 --> 09:08.469
I don't want to miss my flight.

09:08.471 --> 09:10.421
Good luck.

09:10.423 --> 09:12.973
Mahalo, cuz...

09:12.975 --> 09:14.925
for everything.

09:20.866 --> 09:22.783
I just got off the
phone with Kono.

09:22.785 --> 09:24.235
She's heading
to Seattle.

09:24.237 --> 09:25.453
New lead?

09:25.455 --> 09:27.288
We'll see.

09:27.290 --> 09:28.823
So where are we at?

09:28.825 --> 09:30.774
Okay, according to Fong,

09:30.776 --> 09:34.611
the barrel our vic was
found in was filled with lye.

09:34.613 --> 09:37.164
Surprise,
it's highly corrosive.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.749
It's also cheap and easy
to get.

09:38.751 --> 09:39.633
Hey.
Hey.

09:39.635 --> 09:40.718
Max finish the autopsy?
He did.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.420
And look what he found
around the vic's neck.

09:42.422 --> 09:45.005
What is that,
a medical alert ID?

09:45.007 --> 09:48.959
Says the name is Kyle Russo,
D.O.B.: 5-9-78.

09:53.749 --> 09:56.484
Our vic was Secret Service.

10:00.156 --> 10:02.223
<i>Excuse me, Devon Campbell.</i>

10:02.225 --> 10:04.358
Steve McGarrett.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.777
Catherine Rollins. Five-O.
Field office said

10:06.779 --> 10:08.412
you guys were coming.
Hang on a sec. Sorry.

10:08.414 --> 10:11.148
Busy day. Yeah, we can see that.
What's going on?

10:11.150 --> 10:13.834
The president's on his way
to the Island.

10:13.836 --> 10:16.153
He'll be here
later today.

10:16.155 --> 10:18.172
He usually does
Thanksgiving in DC,

10:18.174 --> 10:20.841
but two nights ago he decided
he wanted to come here.

10:20.843 --> 10:23.827
Doesn't leave us much prep time,
but... we'll be ready.

10:23.829 --> 10:26.297
What can I do for you?
We need to talk

10:26.299 --> 10:28.349
to you about one
of your agents, Kyle Russo.

10:28.351 --> 10:29.383
Yeah, what about him?

10:29.385 --> 10:30.885
He was murdered yesterday.

10:30.887 --> 10:32.136
Why?

10:32.138 --> 10:33.837
We found his remains
in a barrel

10:33.839 --> 10:35.172
just offshore this morning.

10:35.174 --> 10:39.110
- You got any suspects?
- No, sir, we don't.

10:39.112 --> 10:41.678
But everything is pointing
to a professional hit.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.281
When was the last time you
spoke with Agent Russo?

10:44.283 --> 10:46.150
I got a text from him
last night.

10:46.152 --> 10:48.619
He said he was headed up
to the North Shore this morning

10:48.621 --> 10:51.071
to check on a bookstore
POTUS might want to visit.

10:51.073 --> 10:52.656
What time did
he send that text?

10:52.658 --> 10:54.542
A little after 9:00. Why?

10:54.544 --> 10:56.877
Because our M.E. puts
time of death someplace

10:56.879 --> 10:58.329
between 5:00 and 7:00.

10:58.331 --> 10:59.630
That means Agent
Russo's killer

10:59.632 --> 11:01.966
took his phone, sent you
that text so you wouldn't

11:01.968 --> 11:03.634
be suspicious
when he didn't show up

11:03.636 --> 11:05.219
for work this morning.
Right.

11:05.221 --> 11:06.703
My God.

11:06.705 --> 11:09.206
Agent Campbell.
What?

11:09.208 --> 11:11.725
All our agents have intel
on POTUS's trip

11:11.727 --> 11:12.709
stored on their phone.

11:12.711 --> 11:14.211
Itinerary down to
the half-minute.

11:14.213 --> 11:15.879
Path of the
motorcade,

11:15.881 --> 11:16.931
emergency protocols.

11:16.933 --> 11:18.149
If that intel has fallen
into the wrong hands,

11:18.151 --> 11:20.067
then we have a threat
to the president.

11:32.130 --> 11:33.413
As a precaution, we're changing
the path of the motorcade

11:33.415 --> 11:36.316
as well as all safe houses,
escape routes.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.381
HPD's helping us
lock everything down

11:39.383 --> 11:41.730
and SWAT's gonna back up
our Counter Assault Team.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.020
Thank you for coming,
Captain.

11:45.022 --> 11:46.855
No problem.
I got everybody on this.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.676
All right.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.461
What do you want from my team?
Plain and simple.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.480
I need you to find the son of a bitch
that killed Kyle Russo.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.315
Now, I don't have
assets in place

11:57.317 --> 11:58.400
to run an investigation.

11:58.402 --> 11:59.701
Right now, my only
concern has to be

11:59.703 --> 12:00.702
the president's safety
and security.

12:00.704 --> 12:01.653
I have no other
priorities.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.021
All right,
I need to, uh,

12:03.023 --> 12:04.372
retrace
Russo's steps.

12:04.374 --> 12:06.124
What can you tell me about
his activities yesterday?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.525
He was in Kailua
for most of it.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.577
POTUS stays at

12:08.579 --> 12:10.245
a private home out there
when he's in town.

12:10.247 --> 12:12.047
Russo was looking into
some of the residents

12:12.049 --> 12:14.299
to see if any of 'em posed a threat.
He check in with you?

12:14.301 --> 12:15.667
He said there was one guy

12:15.669 --> 12:16.718
he wanted to run
some background on,

12:16.720 --> 12:18.003
maybe... maybe
talk to again.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.087
He give you
a name?

12:19.089 --> 12:21.223
Keith Nolan.
That's all he gave me.

12:21.225 --> 12:23.141
Apparently, this guy's
renting a house out there

12:23.143 --> 12:24.843
less than a quarter
of a mile from the one

12:24.845 --> 12:26.261
POTUS is staying in.

12:26.263 --> 12:28.230
Russo said it was
probably nothing.

12:28.232 --> 12:29.731
When I got that
text last night,

12:29.733 --> 12:31.266
I just assumed
the guy checked out.

12:31.268 --> 12:32.550
Yeah, maybe he did.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.552
But if Russo considered
him a potential threat,

12:34.554 --> 12:35.937
he's somebody
we want to talk to.

12:35.939 --> 12:37.522
All right.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.411
Mr. Nolan?

13:00.413 --> 13:02.180
Steve McGarrett,
Five-O.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.765
Can we
talk to you?

13:14.927 --> 13:16.611
Hey.

13:16.613 --> 13:17.696
Boiling water
on the stove.

13:17.698 --> 13:19.314
The guy, uh,
took off in a hurry.

13:19.316 --> 13:20.398
That is a big bullet.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.951
This is a NATO 7.62
sniper round.

13:22.953 --> 13:25.236
It's accurate up
to 1,000 meters.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.488
So maybe Russo was
onto something.

13:32.628 --> 13:33.745
Hey! Five-O!

13:33.747 --> 13:35.613
Let me see your hands,
right now. Who are you?

13:35.615 --> 13:36.948
I'm Sheila Hicks.

13:36.950 --> 13:37.999
I live up the street.

13:38.001 --> 13:41.336
I look after the house
for the owner.

13:41.338 --> 13:42.620
Can I put my hands
down now, please?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.005
Of course you can.
I'm sorry.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.642
Uh...
you, uh,

13:47.644 --> 13:49.260
you happen to get
a look at the guy

13:49.262 --> 13:50.261
that's been
staying here?

13:50.263 --> 13:51.730
Mr. Nolan?

13:51.732 --> 13:53.481
Yeah, he got in
yesterday morning.

13:53.483 --> 13:54.899
He's from Maui.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.017
He's a very friendly guy.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.971
Oh, it's just my daughter!

13:59.973 --> 14:01.272
Come here, sweetie.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.407
Mom, what's going on?

14:02.409 --> 14:03.658
It's okay.

14:03.660 --> 14:05.960
These men are Five-O.

14:05.962 --> 14:07.145
We just have
some questions

14:07.147 --> 14:08.163
about the man who's
renting this house.

14:08.165 --> 14:09.313
Can you tell us
what he looked like?

14:09.315 --> 14:11.315
Sure. He's 40s.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.667
Six feet.

14:12.669 --> 14:14.536
Black hair.
Oh, and you know what?

14:14.538 --> 14:16.320
And he had a tattoo
on the back of his neck.

14:17.173 --> 14:18.340
Uh...

14:18.342 --> 14:19.708
how 'bout this guy?

14:19.710 --> 14:21.292
- You, uh... you seen him?
- Yes.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.629
I saw him and Mr. Nolan
talking outside yesterday.

14:24.631 --> 14:25.997
What time was that?

14:25.999 --> 14:27.048
Little after 4:00?

14:27.050 --> 14:29.000
You know, he didn't
stay very long.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.301
Maybe three,
four minutes.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.353
And then he left,

14:31.355 --> 14:33.888
and Mr. Nolan took off
right after that.

14:33.890 --> 14:35.140
But I-I haven't seen
either of them since.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.841
Okay, how 'bout you?

14:36.843 --> 14:37.809
You see anything?

14:37.811 --> 14:39.778
I just got in an hour ago.

14:39.780 --> 14:41.946
She flew in
for the holiday.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.015
My Andrea's been traveling
for the last few months

14:44.017 --> 14:45.016
but she wanted

14:45.018 --> 14:47.202
to spend Thanksgiving
with her mom.

14:47.204 --> 14:48.352
Oh, that's nice.

14:48.354 --> 14:49.954
That's nice.
Uh, here's your keys.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.355
Thank you.
Sorry about the scare,

14:51.357 --> 14:52.824
and thanks
for your help.

14:52.826 --> 14:55.026
You need anything,

14:55.028 --> 14:56.327
I'm right
next door.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.214
Nosy neighbor is a cop's
best friend, right? - Right.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.584
All right,
thank you.

15:02.586 --> 15:05.053
All right, so Maui PD
has no record

15:05.055 --> 15:06.254
of anyone named
Keith Nolan

15:06.256 --> 15:07.255
that matches
our description.

15:07.257 --> 15:08.807
And according to TSA,

15:08.809 --> 15:10.541
nobody flew in yesterday
under that name.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.876
So I am taking a wild guess,

15:11.878 --> 15:13.094
"Keith Nolan" is an alias.

15:13.096 --> 15:14.378
All right, so Russo...

15:14.380 --> 15:15.730
he's out here
clearing houses,

15:15.732 --> 15:17.882
he meets a guy who calls
himself "Keith Nolan""

15:17.884 --> 15:18.967
he gets a vibe.

15:18.969 --> 15:20.318
All right,
I'm thinking maybe

15:20.320 --> 15:22.103
Nolan could sense
that Russo was onto him.

15:22.105 --> 15:24.222
He follows him
and he kills him.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.356
It's a good theory.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.991
If we're right,
I only have one question:

15:26.993 --> 15:29.694
this guy had to have known
the president was coming

15:29.696 --> 15:31.413
before the Secret Service
went public with it.

15:31.415 --> 15:33.064
That's closely-guarded info.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.449
How did he get it?
Advance team's

15:34.451 --> 15:35.867
been on the ground for 36 hours.

15:35.869 --> 15:36.901
Maybe he figured it out.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.070
Yeah, McGarrett.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.422
Wait a minute, what?

15:41.457 --> 15:42.791
What do you mean, she was...

15:42.793 --> 15:43.842
When was she arrested?

15:43.844 --> 15:45.743
Oh, Mary got arrested.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.629
No, my aunt.
Your aunt got arrested?

15:47.631 --> 15:49.297
I didn't see that coming.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.558
Hi.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.061
Hi.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.479
Thanks.

16:04.481 --> 16:05.814
A second.

16:09.118 --> 16:10.401
You okay?

16:10.403 --> 16:11.736
I'm fine.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.037
Good.

16:13.039 --> 16:16.607
Do you want to tell me
what happened?

16:18.244 --> 16:19.627
Well, I...

16:19.629 --> 16:22.464
I needed some grass,
and, uh...

16:22.466 --> 16:24.666
how was I supposed to know
the guy was a narc?

16:24.668 --> 16:27.001
What?
I wouldn't even be here

16:27.003 --> 16:29.671
if it weren't for those fascists
at the dispensary.

16:29.673 --> 16:31.005
They wouldn't
take my card.

16:31.007 --> 16:32.006
The dispensary?

16:32.008 --> 16:33.007
What... wait
a minute, why...

16:33.009 --> 16:34.175
Yeah, and the guy
behind the counter

16:34.177 --> 16:36.427
told me where
I could find some,

16:36.429 --> 16:37.628
and then I run
into this narc...

16:37.630 --> 16:38.963
Okay, stop, please.
For a minute.

16:38.965 --> 16:39.781
What?

16:39.783 --> 16:41.966
Can we go back?
Yeah.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.852
Why do you have
a medical marijuana card?

16:45.070 --> 16:46.521
I have cataracts.

16:47.323 --> 16:48.990
You have
cataracts?

16:48.992 --> 16:50.241
Yes.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.694
Cataracts, that's what happens
when you get old.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.647
Are you telling me
the truth?

16:56.649 --> 16:57.615
Look...

16:57.617 --> 16:59.868
half the people
my age get them.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.036
Deborah.

17:02.038 --> 17:04.155
Steven...
I'm a cop.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.874
I read people
for a living.

17:05.876 --> 17:07.657
You're not telling me
everything.

17:10.679 --> 17:11.996
Oh...

17:11.998 --> 17:14.848
this isn't how
I wanted to do this.

17:16.185 --> 17:17.835
Do what?

17:21.507 --> 17:23.023
Okay, um...

17:23.026 --> 17:25.343
A couple of months ago,
I wasn't feeling so good,

17:25.345 --> 17:28.396
and, um... I was tired
all the time,

17:28.397 --> 17:30.949
nauseous, headaches...

17:30.951 --> 17:32.317
So I went to the doctor

17:32.319 --> 17:35.570
and they ran a whole
bunch of tests, and, um...

17:37.656 --> 17:38.907
Turns out...

17:38.909 --> 17:41.993
I have a tumor
in my brain.

17:41.995 --> 17:44.195
You have cancer?

17:45.164 --> 17:47.632
Yeah.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.034
How bad is it?

17:51.287 --> 17:53.504
It's bad.

18:01.313 --> 18:02.897
Okay, all right.

18:02.899 --> 18:03.881
What's the plan?

18:03.883 --> 18:05.400
What's the course
of treatment?

18:05.402 --> 18:06.717
Well... there is none.

18:06.719 --> 18:10.054
There is none,
it's... it's...

18:10.056 --> 18:11.506
it's too far along.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.574
No, but...
you know,

18:12.576 --> 18:13.691
chemo, radiation...

18:13.693 --> 18:14.826
No, we talked
about that,

18:14.828 --> 18:16.828
but I... I decided
against it.

18:16.830 --> 18:17.895
Why?

18:17.897 --> 18:20.731
Because they said
it wouldn't work...

18:20.733 --> 18:22.066
so I...

18:22.068 --> 18:23.501
All right, so you just...
that's it? You just give up?

18:23.503 --> 18:25.169
Is that what you're gonna do?
No, no, no, no, wait.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.421
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 'Cause you can't do that.
No, you can't,

18:26.423 --> 18:27.455
because that's what...
You gotta fight this.

18:27.457 --> 18:28.790
Listen to me.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.425
I don't want
to spend

18:30.427 --> 18:31.926
whatever time
I have left

18:31.928 --> 18:33.845
in some hospital,

18:33.847 --> 18:35.346
getting pumped
full of poison

18:35.348 --> 18:37.599
and feeling crappy
all the time, okay?

18:38.934 --> 18:41.686
That's not how
I want to do this.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.754
This is what
I've decided.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.442
I know...

18:51.780 --> 18:52.981
Okay.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.039
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

19:01.041 --> 19:02.940
You wanted to come say
good-bye to us.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.468
Listen, uh...
you can't say

19:13.470 --> 19:14.686
anything to your sister.

19:14.688 --> 19:16.620
Wait, what?

19:16.622 --> 19:18.890
You can't do that, Deb.
That's not fair.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.124
You can't keep
this from her.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.060
No, I-I'm gonna
tell her,

19:22.062 --> 19:24.012
I'm just waiting for
the right moment, okay?

19:24.014 --> 19:26.230
Okay.

19:32.688 --> 19:33.988
Look...
Hmm?

19:33.990 --> 19:35.639
You better get
back to work.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.108
I've still gotta
get booked.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.242
You're not
getting booked.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.995
I am getting
booked.

19:40.997 --> 19:42.530
I don't want any
special treatment, okay?

19:42.532 --> 19:43.498
I'm serious.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.249
Fine. Fine.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.650
You're getting booked.

19:46.652 --> 19:49.253
Good.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.456
I'll send someone to pick
you up when you're through.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.426
Make sure he's
good-looking, okay?

19:58.381 --> 20:00.598
Kid, I love you.
I love you, too.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.885
It's gonna
be all right.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.196
Hey.
Hey.

20:15.198 --> 20:18.199
So I'm running through
some footage that HPD pulled.

20:18.201 --> 20:19.367
I was able to track

20:19.369 --> 20:21.135
Kyle Russo's
movements

20:21.137 --> 20:23.071
from a food truck
he ate at

20:23.073 --> 20:24.539
through Duke's Marketplace,
and you guys were right.

20:24.541 --> 20:25.707
He was followed.

20:26.575 --> 20:28.076
Guy in
the baseball cap.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.796
All right, about
six feet tall,

20:31.798 --> 20:32.914
uh, black hair,

20:32.916 --> 20:33.915
tattoo on his neck.

20:33.917 --> 20:35.383
Matches our description.

20:35.385 --> 20:36.634
All right, keep going.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.022
All right, Chin,
roll it back

20:58.024 --> 20:59.323
a little bit.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.274
Let's see if you could snap in,

21:00.276 --> 21:01.892
get a clean frame of his face.

21:10.385 --> 21:11.953
Killer's name is Dante Barkov.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.291
He's an assassin-for-hire.

21:17.293 --> 21:18.960
He has no allegiance
to anybody.

21:18.962 --> 21:20.128
What are you doing
to find him?

21:20.130 --> 21:21.262
Well, we have
an alert out.

21:21.264 --> 21:22.413
We're also looking into
any known associates

21:22.415 --> 21:23.747
he may have
on the Island.

21:23.749 --> 21:24.932
But right now,
we don't have any leads

21:24.934 --> 21:26.300
on his exact
whereabouts.

21:26.302 --> 21:27.769
Given the circumstances,

21:27.771 --> 21:29.086
your boss needs
to cancel his trip.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.805
That's not
gonna happen.

21:30.807 --> 21:32.940
All due respect, sir,
we're not talking about

21:32.942 --> 21:34.609
a whack job with
a six-shooter, here, okay?

21:34.611 --> 21:36.527
This man
represents

21:36.529 --> 21:37.895
a serious threat
to the president.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.930
Gentlemen...

21:39.932 --> 21:41.949
the president
won't cancel.

21:41.951 --> 21:43.934
I mean, think of
the message it'd send.

21:45.954 --> 21:47.455
The message?

21:48.874 --> 21:50.958
You get the feeling this gentleman isn't
telling us the truth?

21:50.960 --> 21:53.327
Oh, do you get
that feeling, too?

21:53.329 --> 21:56.464
This trip is not about
Thanksgiving, is it?

21:56.466 --> 21:57.965
If it was,
the president would

21:57.967 --> 21:59.634
turn his plane around
and go home

21:59.636 --> 22:01.419
because of
a man like this.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.638
So why don't you
level with us,

22:03.640 --> 22:05.306
and tell us what this
smoke screen is all about?

22:05.308 --> 22:08.476
The president is coming
for a secret meeting

22:08.478 --> 22:11.262
with a small group
from North Korea.

22:11.264 --> 22:13.147
These are one-on-one talks

22:13.149 --> 22:14.432
which could lead to disarmament,

22:14.434 --> 22:16.434
maybe even regime change.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.186
The stakes are huge.

22:18.188 --> 22:19.604
He won't cancel.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.573
Gentlemen, whether
we like it or not,

22:22.575 --> 22:24.826
Air Force One is wheels down
at 6:00 p.m.

22:24.828 --> 22:26.077
If you're right,

22:26.079 --> 22:27.811
Barkov is still planning
to assassinate the president.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.147
We have two hours to find him.

22:44.277 --> 22:45.697
<i>I just got</i>
<i>off the phone with Fong,</i>

22:45.698 --> 22:47.280
who thinks Barkov
might have had some help

22:47.282 --> 22:48.732
in disposing of
Kyle Russo's body.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.117
It turns out

22:50.119 --> 22:52.119
that the M.O.
is pretty specific.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.870
For starters,

22:53.872 --> 22:55.739
the lye that was used

22:55.741 --> 22:58.191
was actually potassium lye.

22:58.193 --> 23:00.076
It's a lot less common
than the regular kind.

23:00.078 --> 23:02.429
Also, it was mixed with water,
which speeds up the reaction.

23:02.431 --> 23:05.048
I cross-referenced
this particular M.O.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.683
with some old cases
and got a few hits.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.769
Anyone with a connection
to Barkov?

23:08.771 --> 23:10.137
Just one.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.838
Rafael Moreno.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.725
He's a cleaner
for an Albanian crime syndicate.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.643
Barkov allegedly did
some jobs for him.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.811
Now, according to Interpol,

23:17.813 --> 23:21.481
Moreno has disappeared
at least a dozen bodies

23:21.483 --> 23:23.567
in the last 18 months.

23:23.569 --> 23:27.070
Okay, so Barkov kills Russo
once Russo gets onto him,

23:27.072 --> 23:29.439
but, uh, body disposal
isn't exactly in his wheelhouse.

23:29.441 --> 23:30.624
So he calls his boy,

23:30.626 --> 23:32.125
Rafael, who hops a flight

23:32.127 --> 23:33.827
to Oahu to help out.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.278
Except for the fact
that there's no record

23:35.280 --> 23:36.997
of any Rafael Moreno
on any inbound flights.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.665
So he used a fake ID.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.450
Which is exactly why
I've got TSA

23:40.452 --> 23:42.636
checking to see if they took
any snapshots of him

23:42.638 --> 23:43.787
while he was at the airport.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.338
If we can determine
what flight he was on,

23:45.340 --> 23:46.623
we can get an alias.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.008
Right, track him down here
on the Island,

23:48.010 --> 23:49.559
see if he can lead us to Barkov.
Right.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.344
Hey, this is TSA now.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.514
Hey, uh,

23:54.516 --> 23:56.767
you got a second for me?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.452
For you I got a whole minute.

23:58.454 --> 24:00.353
Thank you. Come here.

24:04.292 --> 24:06.593
Oh, thanks.

24:08.312 --> 24:10.597
Deb?

24:10.599 --> 24:12.098
Yeah.
Hi.

24:12.100 --> 24:14.167
I'm Catherine Rollins;
I'm Steve's friend.

24:14.169 --> 24:15.502
Friend?

24:16.955 --> 24:18.755
Steve asked me to,
uh, come pick you up

24:18.757 --> 24:19.989
and take you back to his place.

24:19.991 --> 24:23.510
And did he tell you
anything else?

24:26.047 --> 24:28.215
I'm so sorry.

24:29.517 --> 24:31.268
If there's anything
you need at all,

24:31.270 --> 24:33.804
just please let me know, okay.
Thank you.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.639
Let's get you home.

24:36.941 --> 24:39.843
No, I don't... I don't want
to go back there just yet.

24:39.845 --> 24:42.512
Where would you like to go?

24:45.233 --> 24:49.236
Take me to the most
beautiful spot on the Island.

24:50.037 --> 24:51.872
I know just the place.

24:53.074 --> 24:54.875
Come on.

24:57.328 --> 24:59.412
<i>I need some advice.</i>

24:59.414 --> 25:01.414
It's, uh, it's about my aunt.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.551
Aunt Deb, she's sick.

25:04.553 --> 25:06.469
She's sick?

25:06.471 --> 25:07.671
Sick, uh...

25:07.673 --> 25:09.673
She's sick;
she's got a brain tumor.

25:17.348 --> 25:18.982
I'm sorry, man.

25:18.984 --> 25:20.233
Yeah.

25:20.235 --> 25:22.051
What, uh,

25:22.053 --> 25:23.937
what-what are they gonna do?

25:23.939 --> 25:25.906
It's inoperable,

25:25.908 --> 25:28.725
but she's refusing any
other kind of treatment.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.911
I guess that's
her choice, right?

25:30.913 --> 25:32.946
Well, yeah, it's her choice,
but here's the thing,

25:32.948 --> 25:35.582
I mean, it's not just her who's
gonna be affected by this.

25:35.584 --> 25:37.400
I mean, Mary?

25:37.402 --> 25:40.253
Mary-Mary's gonna be
destroyed if we lose her.

25:40.255 --> 25:41.588
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

25:41.590 --> 25:42.839
First Mom pulls

25:42.841 --> 25:44.741
her famous disappearing
act again and now this?

25:44.743 --> 25:47.577
What do I do? How do I... How
do I get her to change her mind?

25:47.579 --> 25:50.413
I don't think, uh,

25:50.415 --> 25:52.048
I don't think you...

25:52.050 --> 25:55.084
I don't think you do try
to change her mind.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.970
You know, I mean, look,

25:56.972 --> 25:58.355
if this...

25:58.357 --> 26:00.523
is your last
Thanksgiving together,

26:00.525 --> 26:01.942
what, you want
to spend it arguing?

26:01.944 --> 26:03.476
No.
No.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.061
You want to try to make
some memories,

26:05.063 --> 26:06.613
some good memories,
something that's gonna last,

26:06.615 --> 26:08.181
something that's gonna bring you
through whatever's coming next.

26:08.183 --> 26:10.033
That's my opinion.

26:10.035 --> 26:12.285
Um,

26:12.287 --> 26:13.603
I'm sorry, man.

26:13.605 --> 26:15.555
Yeah.

26:15.557 --> 26:17.707
Hey, so TSA came through.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.626
Moreno flew in late last night

26:19.628 --> 26:21.277
using the name Diego Silva.

26:21.279 --> 26:22.662
Rented a car using
the same alias.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.781
I was able to ping it
and get a location.

26:27.618 --> 26:30.286
Five-O! Hey, Five-O.

26:30.288 --> 26:32.305
Hey, hey, don't move.
Don't you move.

26:34.225 --> 26:36.142
Rafael Moreno,
you're under arrest.

26:36.144 --> 26:37.477
Get down on your knees.

26:37.479 --> 26:40.146
Put your hands behind your
head, interlock your fingers.

26:46.070 --> 26:47.520
Really?

26:47.522 --> 26:49.105
You really thought

26:49.107 --> 26:51.408
that lame ass move
was gonna work?

26:51.410 --> 26:54.244
Brother, you're a lot
dumber than you look.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.612
Get up.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.113
Steve, the rest
of the house is clear.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.332
There's something you're gonna
want to see.

27:00.117 --> 27:02.502
I got him, I got him.

27:02.504 --> 27:03.653
What's the matter?

27:03.655 --> 27:05.422
Somebody shoot you?

27:05.424 --> 27:08.041
'Cause you got
a nasty boo-boo.

27:11.829 --> 27:14.664
Looks like Barkov's
been staying here as well.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.016
The question is where is he now?

27:28.217 --> 27:29.783
Okay, good.

27:29.785 --> 27:32.936
Yeah, keep me posted.

27:32.938 --> 27:34.188
Hey.
Yeah?

27:34.190 --> 27:35.439
That was Campbell.

27:35.441 --> 27:37.858
The Secret Service,
did they blink?

27:37.860 --> 27:39.359
Air Force One is being diverted
to Kona,

27:39.361 --> 27:41.344
and they are pulling
the security detail as we speak.

27:43.682 --> 27:45.115
What about the house?
CSU find anything

27:45.117 --> 27:46.567
that can tell us
where Barkov's headed?

27:46.569 --> 27:47.735
No, not yet.

27:47.737 --> 27:49.153
They're going through the garage
right now.

27:49.155 --> 27:51.021
They did find a couple bags
of lye, though.

27:51.023 --> 27:52.740
This must be where
they brought Russo's body.

27:52.742 --> 27:54.575
Thanks, Captain.

27:58.362 --> 27:59.947
So you gonna tell us
where Barkov is?

28:00.832 --> 28:02.800
Okay, uh,

28:02.802 --> 28:04.418
Rafael, let me, uh,

28:04.420 --> 28:06.203
you know, break it down for you,
'cause you seem like

28:06.205 --> 28:07.588
you might be confused;
I'm here to help you.

28:07.590 --> 28:09.223
Uh, you're an accessory

28:09.225 --> 28:12.042
after the fact, which is,
uh, it's bad.

28:12.044 --> 28:13.961
Uh, got about a half dozen

28:13.963 --> 28:15.545
international law
enforcement agencies

28:15.547 --> 28:17.214
that want to talk to you,
they want to ask you questions

28:17.216 --> 28:18.816
about some terrible things
that they think you've done.

28:18.818 --> 28:19.883
That's just the beginning.

28:19.885 --> 28:22.319
Right, not to mention,

28:22.321 --> 28:23.604
Barkov planned to kill
the president, too.

28:23.606 --> 28:24.772
We should add
that to the list.

28:24.774 --> 28:26.657
What?

28:26.659 --> 28:28.275
I don't know nothing
about the president.

28:28.910 --> 28:30.110
Oh, I'm sure you don't.

28:30.112 --> 28:31.245
Just like
you didn't know anything

28:31.247 --> 28:32.279
about Kyle Russo, right?

28:32.281 --> 28:33.831
How about this, Rafael?

28:33.833 --> 28:35.398
You're gonna die in prison.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.900
Okay?

28:36.902 --> 28:38.735
But if you talk to us,

28:38.737 --> 28:41.255
then maybe, maybe
we can help you.

28:41.257 --> 28:45.259
I tell you anything
about Barkov,

28:45.261 --> 28:46.593
I end up in his crosshairs.

28:46.595 --> 28:47.711
No, no, no.

28:47.713 --> 28:49.630
We'll protect you.

28:49.632 --> 28:52.349
Not from him.

29:01.676 --> 29:03.811
It is beautiful.

29:03.813 --> 29:05.529
Mm-hmm.

29:05.531 --> 29:06.663
You know, the navy

29:06.665 --> 29:09.233
took me all around the world,
but this...

29:09.235 --> 29:11.819
This is home.

29:11.821 --> 29:13.904
Yeah.

29:13.906 --> 29:15.289
You know, Catherine,

29:15.291 --> 29:17.708
I got a feeling you're gonna
be sticking around for a while.

29:17.710 --> 29:21.328
So, um, can I ask you a favor?

29:21.330 --> 29:22.796
Of course.

29:22.798 --> 29:24.581
Well,

29:24.583 --> 29:26.667
you know Steve has

29:26.669 --> 29:28.719
that tough guy act down pat.

29:28.721 --> 29:30.304
Mm-hmm.

29:30.306 --> 29:31.555
But underneath it all,

29:31.557 --> 29:33.507
he's still
that vulnerable little guy

29:33.509 --> 29:36.894
who thought he lost his mom
and had to grow up too soon.

29:36.896 --> 29:40.097
And Mary,

29:40.099 --> 29:41.899
she's the only one

29:41.901 --> 29:45.102
who really gets that about him
because she lived it, too.

29:45.104 --> 29:48.071
And, um,

29:48.073 --> 29:51.575
well, once I'm gone,

29:51.577 --> 29:53.777
they're gonna need each other
more than ever,

29:53.779 --> 29:57.114
even though they both
won't want to admit it.

29:57.116 --> 29:58.949
Stubborn kids.

29:58.951 --> 30:01.618
So...

30:01.620 --> 30:05.038
You think maybe
you could see to it

30:05.040 --> 30:08.658
that they stay close?

30:08.660 --> 30:11.545
I will.

30:11.547 --> 30:14.431
I promise.

30:15.767 --> 30:17.768
Thanks.

30:24.225 --> 30:26.793
Hey, Steve,

30:26.795 --> 30:27.895
found a boarding pass.

30:27.897 --> 30:29.730
It's one
of Barkov's known aliases.

30:30.565 --> 30:32.733
Check the arrival time.

30:34.852 --> 30:38.121
Barkov landed on Oahu 12 hours
before the Secret Service

30:38.123 --> 30:39.489
even started
their canvass.

30:39.491 --> 30:40.857
So either this guy is psychic...

30:40.859 --> 30:43.794
Or the president
is not the target.

30:43.796 --> 30:46.196
He's after somebody else.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.451
Who's the target, huh?

30:51.453 --> 30:53.253
Who's the real target?

30:53.255 --> 30:54.704
Hey, what's going on?
Barkov's not here

30:54.706 --> 30:56.623
for the president--
he's on a job.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.558
That's right. And since
Barkov called Moreno here

30:58.560 --> 30:59.893
when he needed help,

30:59.895 --> 31:02.346
I'm thinking that job was
for his old friends back

31:02.348 --> 31:03.647
in Albania.
You gonna tell me

31:03.649 --> 31:04.932
who the real target is?

31:04.934 --> 31:06.099
Huh?
Guys, clear out.

31:06.101 --> 31:07.351
CSU, come on. Let's clear out.

31:09.537 --> 31:12.389
Come on, what, are you gonna
waterboard me now?

31:12.391 --> 31:13.991
I don't think so.

31:15.860 --> 31:18.528
What's going on? No, no...

31:20.582 --> 31:23.083
What's going on: you're gonna
talk or you're gonna burn.

31:23.085 --> 31:25.085
You understand?
Wait, wait. You can't do this! Hey!

31:25.087 --> 31:27.170
Who's the target?
Who's the target?!

31:27.172 --> 31:28.789
Who's the target?! Huh?!
Okay, okay, okay!

31:28.791 --> 31:31.758
Okay. Barkov's target is
a woman in Kailua. - Not enough!

31:31.760 --> 31:34.127
Andrea Hicks! Andrea Hicks!
That's all I know!

31:34.129 --> 31:36.213
Hold on, hold on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:36.215 --> 31:37.681
Hey. The nosy neighbor.

31:37.683 --> 31:39.766
The one who gave us
Barkov's description.

31:39.768 --> 31:41.101
Her daughter's name was Andrea.

31:41.103 --> 31:42.686
What did she do
to warrant a hit?

31:42.688 --> 31:44.254
I don't know and I didn't ask.

31:44.256 --> 31:46.473
But Barkov won't leave
the Island till the job is done.

32:16.505 --> 32:18.223
No answer at Sheila Hicks'.

32:18.225 --> 32:20.559
Catherine, what do you got?
Okay,

32:20.561 --> 32:22.144
so I've been looking
into Andrea Hicks.

32:22.146 --> 32:24.313
Up until two months ago,
she was living in Dallas,

32:24.315 --> 32:26.514
working as a dental hygienist.
Then...

32:26.516 --> 32:27.482
she just dropped off the grid.

32:27.484 --> 32:28.617
Do we know why?

32:28.619 --> 32:30.068
Well, according to the FBI,

32:30.070 --> 32:31.954
she witnessed the murder
of a high-ranking member

32:31.956 --> 32:33.322
of a Russian crime family.

32:33.324 --> 32:34.856
The Feds wanted
to talk to her-- she went

32:34.858 --> 32:36.524
<i>- into hiding instead.</i>
<i>- Okay,</i>

32:36.526 --> 32:38.911
<i>and meanwhile the family,</i>
<i>they hire Barkov</i>

32:38.913 --> 32:40.495
to track her down
and shut her up,

32:40.497 --> 32:42.214
permanently.
All right, Catherine, listen to me.

32:42.216 --> 32:44.016
You keep trying
to find Andrea, okay?

32:44.018 --> 32:45.167
We're almost in Kailua.

32:45.169 --> 32:46.534
Yeah, you got it.

32:55.678 --> 32:57.712
We need to get out of here.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.432
What?
Yeah, come on...

33:38.838 --> 33:40.372
Came from the woods.

33:40.374 --> 33:42.590
Secure the perimeter.

33:44.727 --> 33:46.561
We need to lock it down.
Get your men in position.

33:46.563 --> 33:48.814
All right, you heard the man.
Let's move out.

33:55.455 --> 33:57.155
There, there, there.

34:31.324 --> 34:34.476
Oh, my God!

34:45.638 --> 34:47.621
Danny!

34:56.099 --> 34:58.166
Okay, okay.

35:07.560 --> 35:10.529
She caught it
in the shoulder.

35:10.531 --> 35:12.898
She's gonna be okay.

35:33.369 --> 35:35.170
What's the matter?

35:35.172 --> 35:36.421
You all right?

35:36.423 --> 35:38.507
Why wouldn't I
be all right?

35:38.509 --> 35:40.092
Well, you do seem
a little nervous.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.259
Nervous?

35:41.261 --> 35:42.811
Oh, no, no. We're about
to meet the president.

35:42.813 --> 35:44.429
Why are you so zen?
That's a better question.

35:44.431 --> 35:46.264
All of you.

35:46.266 --> 35:48.383
I'm just cool like that.

35:48.385 --> 35:50.185
You know, the president's
a local boy.

35:50.187 --> 35:52.154
That makes us
practically <i>hoapili.</i>

35:52.156 --> 35:53.855
I don't know
what that means.

36:02.398 --> 36:04.616
I was nervous, too,
the first time.

36:04.618 --> 36:05.733
"The first time"?

36:05.735 --> 36:07.035
When'd you meet
the president?

36:07.037 --> 36:09.037
I can't tell you that.

36:09.039 --> 36:10.255
It's classified.

36:10.257 --> 36:12.073
Oh, it's classified,
huh? Oh.

36:12.075 --> 36:14.793
Was it during, uh,
Operation Strawberry Fields?

36:14.795 --> 36:16.744
I've already
said too much.

36:16.746 --> 36:18.964
Huh.

36:28.224 --> 36:30.976
How do I look?
I look all right?

36:30.978 --> 36:31.926
Yeah, you look very handsome.

36:31.928 --> 36:32.927
Thank you.

36:32.929 --> 36:33.895
You do, too.

36:33.897 --> 36:35.230
Thank you.

36:49.295 --> 36:51.413
- Hey!
- Hey!

36:52.582 --> 36:55.050
Here they are, America's heroes.
Look at you.

36:55.052 --> 36:56.635
No thanks necessary.

36:56.637 --> 36:58.370
All in a day's work.

36:58.372 --> 37:01.106
I will take one of those
Longboards though. Thank you.

37:01.108 --> 37:02.941
Thank you. Thank you.

37:02.943 --> 37:03.875
Thank you, brother.

37:03.877 --> 37:05.710
All right,
want to make a toast.

37:05.712 --> 37:09.648
Uh, making the world safer for
turkey and apple pie, that's us.

37:11.134 --> 37:13.068
Speaking of turkey and
apple pie, where's dinner?

37:13.070 --> 37:15.737
Well, I'm afraid, uh,
Mary and I struck out,

37:15.739 --> 37:17.355
uh, when it came
to finding a turkey

37:17.357 --> 37:18.773
big enough
to feed everybody here.

37:18.775 --> 37:22.944
But Kamekona here
has graciously offered

37:22.946 --> 37:26.164
to fix... a shrimp casserole.

37:26.166 --> 37:29.668
Hey, you guys
save the world,

37:29.670 --> 37:31.102
I'll save supper.

37:31.104 --> 37:32.671
No, absolutely not.

37:32.673 --> 37:34.206
We're not eating shrimp
for Thanksgiving.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.458
Beggars can't be
choosers, brah.

37:36.460 --> 37:37.509
Actually, they can.

37:37.511 --> 37:39.294
Uh, I have a
contingency plan.

37:39.296 --> 37:40.712
Really? What kind of plan?

37:40.714 --> 37:41.796
I can't tell you;
it's classified.

37:41.798 --> 37:44.266
Again with the classified, huh?

37:44.268 --> 37:47.602
I had the talk with Mary.

37:49.438 --> 37:51.005
How'd she take it?

37:51.007 --> 37:52.190
She's a strong girl,

37:52.192 --> 37:54.809
but I think right now,
she needs her brother.

38:17.917 --> 38:20.201
We're gonna get
through this.

38:20.203 --> 38:22.387
Yeah?

38:24.307 --> 38:26.558
I just feel
so bad for Joan.

38:28.377 --> 38:30.929
She's so young, and she's not
gonna remember her aunt.

38:30.931 --> 38:32.180
I know. It's
okay though.

38:32.182 --> 38:35.717
We're gonna tell her
all about Aunt Deb.

38:35.719 --> 38:38.903
We're gonna tell her all
about how much she loved us.

38:41.390 --> 38:43.575
All right?

38:45.995 --> 38:48.029
I'm really sorry
about the turkey.

38:48.031 --> 38:50.081
Come on.

Many, many years ago,

40:00.987 --> 40:05.273
my good friend John McGarrett
used to brag about

40:05.275 --> 40:08.943
his sister singing in
these legendary nightclubs

40:08.945 --> 40:11.446
in Los Angeles,
like the Trocadero,

40:11.448 --> 40:14.649
Ciro's and the Cocoanut Grove.

40:14.651 --> 40:16.251

40:20.791 --> 40:25.677
right here tonight in this club,

40:25.679 --> 40:28.313

for this marvelous audience?

40:36.506 --> 40:37.689
Hey!

40:53.021 --> 40:54.706
You plan this?

40:56.542 --> 40:58.126

some memories, right?

41:01.046 --> 41:02.497
Oh, boy. Okay.

41:03.583 --> 41:06.384
Well, I certainly
didn't expect this.

41:06.386 --> 41:08.586
Um...

41:08.588 --> 41:10.088
I mean,
I haven't sung in, well...

41:10.090 --> 41:12.724
about a hundred
years, and, uh...

41:14.227 --> 41:16.511
Well, these old pipes
are pretty rusty.

41:16.513 --> 41:20.548
But, uh, since it's
a special occasion,

41:20.550 --> 41:21.933
oh, what the hell.

41:21.935 --> 41:27.722
