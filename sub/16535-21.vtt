00:02.594 --> 00:04.710
So, it's your birthday tomorrow.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.367
You remembered.

00:07.401 --> 00:08.801
How could I forget?

00:08.836 --> 00:10.637
It pops up on my Google calendar.

00:10.671 --> 00:12.505
Yeah, supposedly the guys
are throwing me, like,

00:12.540 --> 00:14.807
a surprise party at Molly's.

00:14.842 --> 00:16.709
You should come.

00:19.680 --> 00:23.983
So, I read this article, okay,
about this married couple

00:24.018 --> 00:26.819
that bought houses across
the street from each other,

00:26.854 --> 00:29.522
and the guy would go over
for dinner every night,

00:29.557 --> 00:31.891
they'd eat, they'd have sex,

00:31.926 --> 00:33.993
and then he'd go back,
he'd work on his hotrod,

00:34.028 --> 00:35.995
and they made it work like that
for, like, 42 years

00:36.030 --> 00:37.397
without getting divorced.

00:37.431 --> 00:39.065
Okay.

00:39.099 --> 00:41.768
If that's your ideal situation.

00:41.802 --> 00:43.703
I never said ideal.

00:43.737 --> 00:45.939
<i>Units on the City Wide.
We have a hold-up alarm</i>

00:45.973 --> 00:48.766
<i>at 680 North Michigan,
North Schiller Credit Union.</i>

00:48.843 --> 00:50.844
<i>We're getting multiple calls
of shots fired.</i>

00:50.878 --> 00:52.278
<i>Bank robbery in progress.</i>

00:52.313 --> 00:53.913
That's five blocks away.

00:53.948 --> 00:55.882
5021 George, plain clothes
officers responding.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.395 --> 01:09.762
What happened?

01:09.797 --> 01:11.598
They just went down Grand! On bikes!

01:11.632 --> 01:13.266
What do you mean? Like ten-speeds?

01:13.300 --> 01:16.035
- No. Motorcycles.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

01:16.070 --> 01:17.670
Lincoln, 5021 emergency.

01:17.705 --> 01:19.372
Witnesses say that the suspects fled

01:19.406 --> 01:22.308
westbound on Grand Avenue
on motorcycles.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.277
- Are you all right?
- They shot him multiple times.

01:24.311 --> 01:27.280
Hey, Erin. He's gone.

01:27.314 --> 01:28.982
Are there any other offenders
in the building?

01:29.016 --> 01:30.683
No, but they shot the guard
and they shot Jackie.

01:30.718 --> 01:31.985
Come this way.

01:32.019 --> 01:33.620
5021 George, we're inside the bank,

01:33.654 --> 01:34.821
Roll multiple ambos.

01:34.855 --> 01:37.524
<i>Copy that, 5021 George.</i>

01:37.558 --> 01:39.459
- Okay, give me some room.
- I've got a female, white.

01:39.493 --> 01:40.727
50 years of age,
gunshot wound to the leg.

01:40.761 --> 01:42.328
She's bleeding pretty bad.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.631
Let go. I got you.

01:44.665 --> 01:47.700
Look at me. Breathe. Just breathe.

01:47.735 --> 01:49.302
You're gonna be okay.

01:49.336 --> 01:50.970
An officer will meet you
at the hospital,

01:51.005 --> 01:52.505
and he'll take your statement
when you're ready.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.307
You are gonna be okay.

01:54.341 --> 01:56.809
- Thank you.
- Hey, follow this rig to Med.

01:56.844 --> 01:58.811
- Copy that.
- So, one wounded, one dead?

01:58.846 --> 02:00.680
Yeah. Security guard didn't make it.

02:00.714 --> 02:02.715
Whoever did this came in
heavy. They hit the tellers.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.818
They hit the vault. Vanished on
motorcycles with over 150 grand,

02:05.853 --> 02:07.820
according to the manager.

02:07.855 --> 02:10.423
He say whether they handed
out dye packs, GPS trackers?

02:10.457 --> 02:12.325
Haven't gotten that far yet.

02:12.359 --> 02:14.494
Sergeant, a witness saw
one of the offenders drop this

02:14.528 --> 02:15.828
when they were fleeing.

02:15.863 --> 02:16.896
I got no idea what it is.

02:16.931 --> 02:18.431
Oh, it's a cell jammer.

02:18.465 --> 02:19.999
Bag it as evidence.

02:20.034 --> 02:22.335
And make sure you got a copy
of everyone's ID

02:22.369 --> 02:24.504
- that you interviewed so far.
- Yes, sir.

02:24.538 --> 02:26.940
I need you outside to move
the yellow tape back 50 yards,

02:26.974 --> 02:28.374
and roll in the crime lab.

02:28.409 --> 02:29.809
- All right, but...
- Now.

02:31.645 --> 02:33.413
Detective Upton. Robbery-Homicide.

02:33.447 --> 02:35.515
Hank Voight. Intelligence.

02:35.549 --> 02:37.083
Well, I appreciate the help, Sergeant,

02:37.117 --> 02:39.018
but as of now, this is my scene.

02:39.053 --> 02:41.754
My team recovered evidence,
saved a woman's life.

02:41.789 --> 02:43.356
We're running point.

02:43.390 --> 02:44.958
Make sure those shell casings
are photo'd,

02:44.992 --> 02:48.027
bagged, and tagged.

02:48.062 --> 02:50.096
I've been after this crew
for the last three weeks.

02:50.130 --> 02:54.133
Huh. Then why did my team respond first?

02:54.168 --> 02:56.402
I'm from Robbery-Homicide.

02:56.437 --> 02:59.105
There's been a robbery
and a homicide here.

02:59.139 --> 03:01.574
So, I'd appreciate it
if you vacated my crime scene.

03:04.612 --> 03:06.179
Huh.

03:10.722 --> 03:14.708
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

03:15.809 --> 03:17.199
All right, what we know so far:

03:17.200 --> 03:21.160
we got a four-man takeover crew
armed with Sig MPXs,

03:21.223 --> 03:23.725
dressed to the nines in Kevlar
and motorcycle helmets

03:23.750 --> 03:26.156
with blacked out visors
to conceal their identity.

03:26.257 --> 03:28.193
As soon as this crew enters a bank,

03:28.218 --> 03:29.716
they shoot out the security cameras,

03:29.741 --> 03:31.732
which is why there's
so little footage of them.

03:31.757 --> 03:34.702
In this latest robbery,
they killed a security guard,

03:34.817 --> 03:37.461
and they shot a female teller
who was going for an alarm.

03:37.486 --> 03:39.039
We know they also use cell jammers

03:39.074 --> 03:41.320
so that nobody in the banks can call 911.

03:41.345 --> 03:43.811
And this crew comes in heavy,
demanding all the money

03:43.845 --> 03:45.246
in the drawers and the vault.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.147
They use dirt bikes as getaway vehicles,

03:47.182 --> 03:49.083
easily cutting through traffic,

03:49.117 --> 03:51.885
which is how they've eluded
responding patrol cars.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.788
All right, I talked to an
ex-burglar C.I. buddy of mine.

03:54.823 --> 03:58.058
He said the cell jammer came
from Bucktown.

03:58.093 --> 04:00.828
This is Jimmy Rickert.
Old-school tech guy.

04:00.862 --> 04:02.930
He illegally imports cell jammers

04:02.964 --> 04:04.999
from China into the US and sells them

04:05.033 --> 04:06.967
through his electronics
business to burglars.

04:07.002 --> 04:10.104
I was able to track the serial number
from the supplier in Beijing.

04:10.138 --> 04:11.805
It was delivered,
along with other jammers,

04:11.840 --> 04:13.201
to his storefront a month ago.

04:13.226 --> 04:14.408
Is there any sort of pattern

04:14.442 --> 04:15.676
to the types of banks
that they're hitting?

04:15.710 --> 04:16.944
Credit unions.

04:16.978 --> 04:18.646
They're targeting them downtown.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.113
Lots of daily on-hand cash,

04:20.148 --> 04:22.182
but less security
than the corporate branches.

04:22.217 --> 04:24.151
In the last few weeks,
this crew's hit five banks

04:24.185 --> 04:25.753
and done over half a million in cash.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.321
Sorry for the interruption, Sergeant.

04:27.866 --> 04:29.957
You get lost on your way back
to Area Central?

04:30.335 --> 04:32.126
You got balls, trying to steal my case.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.996
- Oh...
- Detective, that's enough.

04:40.001 --> 04:41.935
Your office.

04:47.175 --> 04:49.443
Chief.

04:49.477 --> 04:51.445
What's your pitch? I've heard hers.

04:51.479 --> 04:53.681
This crew is hot.
They're getting more brazen.

04:53.715 --> 04:54.848
They're not just shooting cameras.

04:54.883 --> 04:55.983
They're killing people now.

04:56.017 --> 04:57.785
They need to be put down ASAP.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.320
And where are you at with this again?

04:59.354 --> 05:01.021
I've been with this crew since day one.

05:01.056 --> 05:02.990
I feel like I'm getting close
to identifying...

05:03.024 --> 05:05.826
Close? You're five banks
and two bodies behind them.

05:05.860 --> 05:08.829
Look, the solve rate
in Intelligence is 90%.

05:08.863 --> 05:10.397
What's Robbery-Homicide? Maybe 20?

05:10.432 --> 05:12.166
You're gonna throw stats at me?

05:12.200 --> 05:14.001
All right, Intelligence is
taking the case.

05:14.035 --> 05:15.969
Because he flexes his stripes?

05:16.004 --> 05:17.404
You want me to flex mine?

05:17.439 --> 05:19.340
I said what I said.

05:19.374 --> 05:22.142
Get your files to Voight.

05:22.177 --> 05:24.178
You know, I always heard
you were a son of a bitch.

05:24.212 --> 05:25.846
Now I know it's true.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.948
Yeah, getting me those files
would be great.

05:32.754 --> 05:34.321
Jimmy Rickert.

05:36.057 --> 05:38.192
Hey.

05:38.226 --> 05:40.060
I've used one of these before.

05:40.095 --> 05:42.429
But the thing is I'm allowed to by law.

05:42.464 --> 05:43.931
But you, on the other hand, are not.

05:43.965 --> 05:47.167
So, who'd you sell it to?

05:47.202 --> 05:51.038
You see anything
that fancy on these shelves?

05:51.072 --> 05:53.073
Well, you know, I'm sure
that if we tossed this place

05:53.108 --> 05:56.176
hard enough, we'd find a box
that says "sent from China,"

05:56.211 --> 06:00.214
but then you and me... we'd have
all these trust issues.

06:00.248 --> 06:03.717
Listen, man, we need you
to cooperate, all right?

06:03.752 --> 06:05.386
Otherwise you're gonna have
to spend the night

06:05.420 --> 06:08.055
in one of our luxurious
overcrowded holding cells.

06:08.089 --> 06:09.523
Come on.

06:12.827 --> 06:14.895
Well, last guy who bought this model...

06:14.929 --> 06:16.930
he came in a few days ago.

06:16.965 --> 06:19.233
- Calls himself T-Rod.
- T-Rod.

06:19.267 --> 06:21.935
Black, maybe 30.

06:21.970 --> 06:24.371
Corn-fed fella who...

06:24.406 --> 06:28.142
might run a burglary crew
on the Southside.

06:28.176 --> 06:31.278
- All right.
- Okay. Okay.

06:31.312 --> 06:33.480
- Is this a Betamax?
- Yeah.

06:33.515 --> 06:35.916
I got a JVC that doesn't rewind.

06:35.950 --> 06:37.217
You think you can fix it?

06:37.252 --> 06:39.052
Sure. Bring it by.

06:39.087 --> 06:40.454
All right. Thanks, man.

06:40.488 --> 06:43.257
- Al, it's 2017.
- Yeah.

06:43.291 --> 06:46.126
All right, well, next time
we get an overtime check,

06:46.161 --> 06:48.228
I'm buying you a Blu-ray player.

06:51.032 --> 06:54.935
Ugh, dog, this report won't load.

06:54.969 --> 06:57.771
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
The rig's got built-in wifi.

06:57.806 --> 06:58.772
Just get on it.

06:58.807 --> 07:00.274
Oh, okay.

07:00.308 --> 07:02.776
Oh, you got to let me
drive this rig sometime.

07:02.811 --> 07:06.780
- I'm gonna forget I heard that.
- That's not right.

07:06.815 --> 07:08.015
All right, this is Thaddius Rodgers.

07:08.049 --> 07:09.850
They also call him T-Rod.

07:09.884 --> 07:11.952
He's got a long sheet for
home invasions and burglaries.

07:11.986 --> 07:13.320
That's T-Rod's ride right there.

07:13.354 --> 07:14.855
We had a tac team sitting on the house,

07:14.889 --> 07:16.356
but before we could get there, he left.

07:16.391 --> 07:18.492
They tracked him here. Bouncer confirms

07:18.526 --> 07:20.894
- Rodgers is inside with his boys.
- Let's move.

07:32.340 --> 07:34.408
- Champagne room.
- Copy that.

07:39.514 --> 07:43.150
CPD! We need to see everybody's hands.

07:43.184 --> 07:44.985
Hey! Don't move.

07:45.019 --> 07:46.487
Keep your hands where I can see them.

07:46.521 --> 07:48.555
Hey! Hey, no need to get rough, players.

07:48.590 --> 07:50.624
I'll take it, man. Get your
hands on the rail, player.

07:50.658 --> 07:52.960
Hands on the rail! You too.

07:52.994 --> 07:55.195
Thaddius Rodgers, you're under arrest.

07:55.230 --> 07:57.364
Come down here. Come down here!

07:57.398 --> 07:58.999
All right, put the bracelets
on all of them

07:59.033 --> 08:00.300
and confiscate this money.

08:00.335 --> 08:02.069
Come on. Let's go.

08:02.103 --> 08:06.874
Okay. Uh... this is a lot
better than a trash pull.

08:06.908 --> 08:08.842
There you go, miss.

08:08.877 --> 08:11.378
I'm sorry about this.

08:11.412 --> 08:14.348
So, you graduated
from pulling burglaries

08:14.382 --> 08:17.584
to bank robberies?

08:17.619 --> 08:21.188
I got to respect that kind of ambition.

08:21.222 --> 08:23.023
I already told you I wasn't talking.

08:23.057 --> 08:25.192
You killed a guard.
You shot a teller in the leg.

08:25.226 --> 08:26.894
What happened? She didn't put the money

08:26.928 --> 08:28.228
in the bag fast enough,
she reached for the alarm?

08:28.263 --> 08:30.197
I never ripped no banks.

08:30.231 --> 08:32.933
I'd never catch a federal charge
and go away until I'm gray.

08:32.967 --> 08:34.433
You know, what I'm disappointed about is

08:34.469 --> 08:36.370
you and your boy snatch
half a mil tax-free,

08:36.404 --> 08:37.938
and you drop it on tail?

08:37.972 --> 08:40.340
You might've gotten away with it, too,

08:40.375 --> 08:43.544
but you left that behind.

08:43.578 --> 08:45.913
Mm-hmm.

08:45.947 --> 08:48.048
Uh, y'all got a second?

08:48.082 --> 08:49.516
We traced the serial numbers
on the bills

08:49.551 --> 08:51.118
confiscated at the club,

08:51.152 --> 08:53.053
and they don't match any from the banks.

08:53.087 --> 08:55.188
They do, however, match
the bills that were confiscated

08:55.223 --> 08:58.258
in a home invasion robbery
two days ago in Gold Coast.

08:58.293 --> 09:00.260
This older woman named Ellen Prager.

09:00.295 --> 09:02.029
This lady was so paranoid
that her sons were gonna

09:02.063 --> 09:03.363
dip into her lottery cash

09:03.398 --> 09:05.065
that she marked all of the bills.

09:05.099 --> 09:06.433
T-Rod and his boys must've
used the cell jammer

09:06.467 --> 09:08.068
to block her security system,

09:08.102 --> 09:10.103
which works on a cellular signal.

09:10.138 --> 09:11.438
They tied Prager up, cracked her safe,

09:11.472 --> 09:13.307
and stole 200K in cash.

09:13.341 --> 09:15.375
So it's not the same tracker
that the bank crew used.

09:15.410 --> 09:17.044
- Afraid not.
- All right, get her down here,

09:17.078 --> 09:19.079
set up a lineup. Let's get T-Rod ID'd

09:19.113 --> 09:20.414
and charged with that crime.

09:20.448 --> 09:22.316
Sarge, been doing a little research

09:22.350 --> 09:25.152
on Upton's files from Robbery-Homicide.

09:25.186 --> 09:27.120
Think I found something.

09:28.690 --> 09:30.257
All right, these red pieces are

09:30.291 --> 09:32.059
the banks that have already been hit.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.727
So, this is the crew.
Now, what do the banks

09:33.761 --> 09:35.395
that they've already hit have in common?

09:35.430 --> 09:37.397
They're all credit unions
that don't have

09:37.432 --> 09:39.066
counter-to-ceiling bullet-proof
teller windows.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.601
- Okay.
- All right, so I've

09:40.635 --> 09:42.636
narrowed it down...
these green pieces signify

09:42.670 --> 09:45.606
the last three banks downtown
that don't have teller glass,

09:45.640 --> 09:48.141
and they're all within a few
blocks of freeway entrances

09:48.176 --> 09:50.110
or Lakeshore Drive,
which makes it real easy

09:50.144 --> 09:53.580
for a motorcycle to just disappear.

09:53.615 --> 09:55.582
All right. Get Jay and Erin hip to this.

09:55.617 --> 09:58.185
Break up into teams.
Check out these banks

09:58.219 --> 10:01.288
and their surveillance cameras,
see if anyone's casing them.

10:01.322 --> 10:03.979
We only have access
to the latest 24 hours

10:04.004 --> 10:06.093
worth of footage; anything
older than that is stored

10:06.127 --> 10:08.528
off-site at our security firm.

10:08.563 --> 10:11.465
Stop there. Stop there.
Will you zoom in on that?

10:11.499 --> 10:13.433
Looks like our suspects,
but only two of them.

10:13.468 --> 10:15.035
That's all they need to case the place.

10:15.069 --> 10:16.370
They're clocking the crowd,

10:16.404 --> 10:18.005
clocking getaway routes, even you.

10:18.039 --> 10:20.841
We need a copy of this footage.
Can you put it on a flash drive?

10:21.809 --> 10:24.044
Wait... what?

10:24.078 --> 10:25.312
Stay in this office.

10:25.346 --> 10:26.980
You lock the door behind us.

10:27.015 --> 10:28.448
5021 George, shots fired, 10-1, 10-1.

10:28.483 --> 10:30.317
Kinzie & Hubbard Credit Union.

10:30.351 --> 10:32.719
Put the money in the bag! Hurry up!

10:32.754 --> 10:35.355
Chicago PD! Drop your weapons!

10:42.030 --> 10:44.364
Move it!

10:46.267 --> 10:47.668
Cover!

10:48.503 --> 10:50.137
Let's go! Come on, come on!

10:50.171 --> 10:52.305
Go, go.

10:59.247 --> 11:00.380
Go, go.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.567
Stop!

11:23.237 --> 11:26.373
- Hey!
- Don't move!

11:26.407 --> 11:28.175
Stop! Police!

11:36.451 --> 11:39.558
Stop! Drop the weapon!

11:39.721 --> 11:41.521
Stop!

12:11.867 --> 12:13.851
Hey, I heard you got one.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.070
Couldn't have been more than 15.

12:17.312 --> 12:20.983
Well, 15 or 50, trigger doesn't know
the difference who's pulling it.

12:25.947 --> 12:27.113
You got a name?

12:27.148 --> 12:29.120
So far, it's "go to hell."

12:29.450 --> 12:32.118
Hank, this whole crew's just kids.

12:37.291 --> 12:41.127
I know your mama gave you a name.

12:41.162 --> 12:43.496
Your prints didn't pop up in any
criminal system that we got,

12:43.531 --> 12:45.432
so what did you do...
you just wake up one morning,

12:45.466 --> 12:47.000
decide you wanted to rob banks?

12:47.034 --> 12:48.768
Huh?

12:48.803 --> 12:51.338
Okay, what about your friends

12:51.372 --> 12:54.241
who beat feet and left you
holding the bag?

12:54.275 --> 12:56.977
What are their names?

12:57.011 --> 13:01.081
Look at me.

13:01.115 --> 13:03.116
We are trying to help you
get out of prison

13:03.150 --> 13:05.418
while you still got a life to live.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.292
Fine. Don't talk.

13:12.326 --> 13:14.261
Just look.

13:22.203 --> 13:24.504
That's on you.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.606
This is all on you now, son.

13:30.578 --> 13:33.146
I want a public defender
and a juvenile advocate,

13:33.180 --> 13:36.983
and until I get both,
I'm not saying another word.

13:37.018 --> 13:38.985
I know bank robbery is a federal crime,

13:39.020 --> 13:41.488
and they'll never charge me as an adult.

13:41.522 --> 13:43.423
I'll be released when I turn 18.

13:46.327 --> 13:48.862
Well, it sounds like you know
more than we do.

13:54.535 --> 13:58.538
Someone coached that kid on what
to say in case he got caught.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.407
All right, call
the public defender's office

14:00.441 --> 14:02.208
and get a Juvenile Advocate down here.

14:02.243 --> 14:04.010
- Done and done.
- Upton's files...

14:04.045 --> 14:06.379
found one of interest.

14:06.414 --> 14:08.014
He look familiar to you?

14:08.049 --> 14:10.483
That's Corey Jenkins, 14.

14:10.518 --> 14:13.019
Upton got his prints
from Child Services.

14:13.054 --> 14:15.021
He's a runaway foster child from Harvey.

14:15.056 --> 14:16.323
Huh. From Harvey?

14:16.357 --> 14:18.191
Yeah, one of your hometown boys.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.893
Got anything else in that file?

14:19.927 --> 14:22.529
Actually, yeah. This guy, Lavar Spann.

14:22.563 --> 14:24.931
He was in the same file as Corey.

14:24.966 --> 14:27.033
She wrote a bunch of notes on the back,

14:27.068 --> 14:29.135
but her handwriting's worse than mine.

14:31.472 --> 14:33.073
Hmm.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.176
Ran the DOA's prints.

14:36.210 --> 14:39.112
Your dead offender's name is
Curtis Jace.

14:39.146 --> 14:42.415
Date of birth says he'd turn 15
next week.

14:58.299 --> 15:00.934
That's Curtis.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.136
My baby boy!

15:07.942 --> 15:10.910
Ma'am, um,

15:10.945 --> 15:12.979
I'm Detective Jay Halstead.

15:13.014 --> 15:15.248
This is Detective Erin Lindsay.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.218
We're so sorry for your loss.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.053
If you're able, we'd like to ask you

15:20.087 --> 15:22.055
a few questions about Curtis.

15:22.089 --> 15:27.260
Which one of you killed him?

15:27.294 --> 15:30.330
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.232
Your son was armed, and...

15:32.266 --> 15:34.267
It was you!

15:34.301 --> 15:36.136
He was only 14!

15:36.170 --> 15:39.072
- Okay, hold on, hold on.
- And you took him from me!

15:39.106 --> 15:41.474
You killed my child!

15:41.509 --> 15:43.576
What right do you have?

15:54.388 --> 15:57.257
Uh-oh.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.459
If it isn't Detective Goldilocks.

15:59.493 --> 16:03.029
Hmm, there haven't been
any robberies or homicides

16:03.064 --> 16:04.998
this morning,
so let me guess why you're here.

16:05.032 --> 16:08.301
- Sergeant...
- Uh-uh. Wait. I'm good at this.

16:08.335 --> 16:12.172
You're here because you can't let it go.

16:12.206 --> 16:14.174
Voight called me down here.

16:17.178 --> 16:19.312
Heh. Well, then,
let me just buzz you up.

16:19.346 --> 16:23.116
Sure. Great. Thank you, Sergeant Platt.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.351
Trudy Platt?

16:25.386 --> 16:28.621
Worked Robbery-Homicide
like 15 years ago?

16:28.656 --> 16:30.323
That's right. Why?

16:30.357 --> 16:33.460
Uh, hey, Sergeant Voight's
waiting for you.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.535
- Yeah, we got him in custody.
- I knew it.

16:42.570 --> 16:44.337
This kid was robbing for Spann.

16:44.371 --> 16:48.074
Yeah. How does he fit into it?

16:48.109 --> 16:50.176
Ex-bank robber from the Westside.

16:50.211 --> 16:52.011
Did time in federal lock-ups.

16:52.046 --> 16:53.513
Last time he pulled a heist,
he was shot in the back

16:53.547 --> 16:56.182
by an FBI agent,
left partially paralyzed.

16:56.217 --> 16:58.084
Did a dime in the infirmary wing
in Leavenworth,

16:58.119 --> 17:01.221
and was paroled a year ago.

17:01.255 --> 17:05.157
Obviously you've got a theory
linking him to this kid.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.727
Spann can't physically
rob banks anymore, so I think

17:07.761 --> 17:09.561
he recruited teenagers
from his old neighborhood

17:09.597 --> 17:13.199
- to do it for him, like Fagin.
- Huh.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.367
From the Charles Dickens novel.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.368
Yeah, I get the reference.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.105
Spann won a lawsuit against
the feds because he was shot.

17:19.140 --> 17:21.074
After he got out of prison,
he used his settlement

17:21.108 --> 17:23.576
to buy a used car lot.

17:23.611 --> 17:25.411
Let's hit that lot.

17:37.091 --> 17:39.726
Hey! Where's your boss?

17:39.760 --> 17:42.462
Hey, round up all these pups,

17:42.496 --> 17:44.397
get paper on every one of them.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.466
Everybody bring it in,
bring it in. Come on.

17:48.402 --> 17:52.238
Like I said,
make sure the rims on every car

17:52.273 --> 17:54.207
don't have water spots.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.709
Now get out of here.

17:56.744 --> 18:00.280
Kids these days. They don't want
to work hard for their money.

18:01.515 --> 18:04.250
Why don't you do the honors?

18:04.285 --> 18:06.653
Lavar Spann, we have a warrant
to search your business

18:06.687 --> 18:08.755
and all records found within.

18:12.293 --> 18:16.429
All right, fellas,
any gang affiliations?

18:16.463 --> 18:18.264
No? No?

18:18.299 --> 18:20.733
Take that hat off.
You all like robbing banks, huh?

18:20.768 --> 18:23.102
All right, these are
gang affiliation cards.

18:23.137 --> 18:25.605
I want you to fill these out.
Each and every one of you.

18:25.639 --> 18:27.373
Don't leave anything blank.

18:29.210 --> 18:30.777
You're not gonna find anything.

18:30.811 --> 18:33.513
I did my time.

18:33.547 --> 18:37.584
These days, I'm just a working man.

18:37.618 --> 18:41.154
This kid, Corey Jenkins...
he works here?

18:42.389 --> 18:44.924
He was arrested for bank robbery.

18:44.959 --> 18:47.860
That right? Corey?

18:47.895 --> 18:50.530
He's a good boy.
That don't sound like him.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.632
I agree.

18:52.666 --> 18:54.801
It felt like somebody else
put him up to it.

18:54.835 --> 18:57.303
You implying something?

18:57.338 --> 18:58.938
Kids mess up, that's on them.

18:58.973 --> 19:02.208
And being from the hood,
I'm just trying to help out,

19:02.243 --> 19:05.278
give these kids jobs
and instill some discipline

19:05.312 --> 19:07.146
instead of them earning money
on the corners.

19:07.181 --> 19:11.351
I think the job skills
you're teaching is bank robbery.

19:11.385 --> 19:15.221
Listen to her. She's all fired up.

19:15.256 --> 19:18.958
So, here's the deal: if I find out

19:18.993 --> 19:20.893
you put a pack of boys
up to robbing banks,

19:20.928 --> 19:24.697
I'm gonna come back here,

19:24.732 --> 19:27.500
and it won't be nearly as civil.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.336
What?

19:30.371 --> 19:35.427
You gonna... beat a cripple?

19:35.609 --> 19:38.380
I'll sue, like last time.

19:38.579 --> 19:40.647
Make me a fortune.

19:50.270 --> 19:53.971
We need a warrant for Spann's
home and his multiple vehicles.

19:54.006 --> 19:56.037
Could've hidden that bank's
money in any one of them.

19:56.092 --> 19:59.161
You have no proof that Lavar Span,
who's physically disabled,

19:59.187 --> 20:01.005
conspired to orchestrate these crimes,

20:01.030 --> 20:03.565
and zero evidence he's set foot
in a bank since his parole.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.834
I know he's making these kids
do this for him,

20:05.868 --> 20:08.503
and we have one of them
in custody: Corey Jenkins.

20:08.538 --> 20:10.505
He's only 14 years old.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.175
When Lavar Spann was shot
by the FBI and went to prison,

20:13.209 --> 20:14.776
he read law books nonstop.

20:14.811 --> 20:16.745
He filed a lawsuit,
dragged on for years.

20:16.779 --> 20:18.981
Sorry... are you saying the
State's Attorney's Office is

20:19.015 --> 20:20.391
afraid of a lawsuit?

20:20.416 --> 20:22.115
No. I'm saying this case is a mess.

20:22.140 --> 20:24.586
You shot an African-American teenager,

20:24.621 --> 20:26.555
who, from the reports I've seen,

20:26.589 --> 20:27.890
never actually fired his weapon.

20:27.924 --> 20:30.425
Are you kidding me?

20:30.460 --> 20:33.896
Have you ever looked down the
barrel of an automatic weapon?

20:33.930 --> 20:35.330
No?

20:35.365 --> 20:36.899
Good.

20:39.636 --> 20:41.937
Got a real velvet touch there, Steve.

20:41.971 --> 20:44.006
I'm not trying
to win a popularity contest.

20:44.040 --> 20:48.010
Show me a direct link
between Spann and the robberies.

20:53.049 --> 20:54.850
All right, let's get eyes on Spann.

20:54.884 --> 20:56.752
We're going around the clock
on this one.

20:56.786 --> 20:58.687
Hey, where are we at ID-ing these kids?

20:58.721 --> 21:00.923
They all got juvie records...
underage drinking,

21:00.957 --> 21:03.058
possession, assault.

21:03.092 --> 21:04.860
And they're the future leaders
of tomorrow.

21:04.894 --> 21:06.528
All right, Al, gas up the van.

21:06.563 --> 21:08.764
It's you... call Halstead...
hey, you want in?

21:08.798 --> 21:10.465
All right. And Upton.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.568
We're gonna start surveillance on Spann.

21:23.913 --> 21:26.048
Got to admit,
there's something inspiring

21:26.082 --> 21:29.885
about this guy not letting his
bum leg ruin his American dream.

21:29.919 --> 21:32.788
Sense of humor? Don't get that
much on my current unit.

21:32.822 --> 21:35.057
Rumor has it
you were meritoriously promoted

21:35.091 --> 21:37.659
to detective... is that right?

21:37.694 --> 21:39.661
Yeah, that's right.

21:39.696 --> 21:41.663
What, you shake your feathers
in front of the right commander,

21:41.698 --> 21:43.565
or is your uncle an alderman?

21:43.600 --> 21:46.802
I was undercover for a year.

21:46.836 --> 21:49.071
So, put that in your pipe and smoke it.

21:51.007 --> 21:53.508
Would you like to elaborate
on this UC case for us?

21:53.543 --> 21:55.677
I would love to,

21:55.712 --> 21:58.747
but I'm under a gag order
from the AUSA's office.

21:58.781 --> 22:00.582
It's still being adjudicated.

22:00.617 --> 22:02.150
The US Attorney's Office
made it very clear:

22:02.185 --> 22:03.852
if I talk, I get fired.

22:03.886 --> 22:05.654
And no offense,

22:05.688 --> 22:08.156
but this is the first time
in the back of your van.

22:11.628 --> 22:12.961
Hey, check it out.

22:23.206 --> 22:26.775
That's Sammy Ray. 17. He was
one of the kids at the car lot.

22:28.645 --> 22:30.946
Kawasaki. That's the same motorcycle

22:30.980 --> 22:32.114
the other kids used to rob the banks.

22:32.148 --> 22:33.882
We got to go after him.

22:33.916 --> 22:36.618
We're not following
a dirt bike in an Econoline van.

22:36.653 --> 22:38.820
First thing that kid's gonna do
is lose us down an alleyway.

22:38.855 --> 22:40.789
But I admire your enthusiasm.

22:46.996 --> 22:48.930
So, what are we looking at for Corey?

22:50.867 --> 22:54.169
Armed robbery. Plus murder.

22:55.005 --> 22:57.183
When can we get him in front
of a judge to talk bail?

22:57.208 --> 22:58.707
I don't think you understand.
Corey and those boys

22:58.741 --> 23:00.475
killed a security guard.

23:00.510 --> 23:02.477
On top of that, he's skipped out
on every foster home

23:02.512 --> 23:03.679
he's ever been a part of,

23:03.713 --> 23:05.714
so I can guarantee no bail,

23:05.748 --> 23:07.849
and he's gonna be remanded
into the state's custody.

23:07.884 --> 23:11.086
I didn't kill that guard.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.021
What?

23:15.892 --> 23:18.389
I didn't shoot that guard.

23:19.095 --> 23:21.163
I'd never shoot no one.

23:21.288 --> 23:24.389
Okay. Then who did?

23:25.210 --> 23:27.612
Who did, Corey? Curtis Jace?

23:27.637 --> 23:29.037
One of those other boys who got away?

23:29.072 --> 23:30.539
I need a name up out of you, dog.

23:30.573 --> 23:32.007
No, let's pick this up later.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.575
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you look at me.

23:33.609 --> 23:35.177
Look at me.

23:35.211 --> 23:37.012
You got two feet in the hole.

23:37.365 --> 23:39.848
Okay? The next four years
of your life are buried.

23:39.882 --> 23:41.783
For what? For what, Corey?

23:41.818 --> 23:43.919
For some guy to cash out on you?

23:43.953 --> 23:46.688
If y'all want to work something
out, right now is the time,

23:46.723 --> 23:48.790
because if you give me Spann,
with his record,

23:48.825 --> 23:50.525
he's going away
for the rest of his life.

23:50.560 --> 23:51.811
He won't be able to touch you.

23:52.228 --> 23:54.569
If anyone talks,

23:55.298 --> 23:57.380
he'll find a way to get to us anyway.

23:57.405 --> 24:00.736
Officer, I have to insist
that we take a break.

24:02.905 --> 24:04.606
Now.

24:06.242 --> 24:09.277
Okay.

24:12.782 --> 24:14.716
Just got a call
from the state crime lab.

24:14.751 --> 24:17.753
There were spent shell casings
recovered at all six banks,

24:17.787 --> 24:20.756
but any fingerprints on the
casings burnt off in the chamber

24:20.790 --> 24:22.557
before the shells were ejected.

24:22.592 --> 24:26.795
However, a dozen rounds
recovered were from misfires,

24:26.829 --> 24:29.231
so the lab sent these to AFIS,

24:29.265 --> 24:32.334
and they analyzed the partial
thumbprints left on the primers

24:32.368 --> 24:33.835
by whoever loaded the clips.

24:33.870 --> 24:35.737
They got two hits:

24:35.772 --> 24:37.739
Bobby and Darren Wilkes.

24:37.774 --> 24:40.075
The brothers got printed two years ago

24:40.109 --> 24:42.344
when they were arrested
in a smash-and-grab robbery.

24:42.378 --> 24:44.746
And they both work at Spann's car lot?

24:44.781 --> 24:47.082
- Thank God for cheap ammo.
- Exactly.

24:47.116 --> 24:48.950
Okay, so, what do we got on these two?

24:48.985 --> 24:50.786
All we know about the boys is
that they took off

24:50.820 --> 24:52.254
from their foster home a few months ago.

24:52.288 --> 24:54.756
Now they supposedly crash
at a foreclosed home

24:54.791 --> 24:57.192
that their real family
used to own West Monroe.

24:57.226 --> 24:58.794
Good work. Grab them.

25:00.663 --> 25:02.264
Kid is scared out of his mind.

25:02.298 --> 25:05.033
Yeah, I heard. Go back them up.

25:05.067 --> 25:07.135
Copy.

25:23.186 --> 25:25.353
- I'll go around back.
- Okay.

25:25.388 --> 25:27.823
- Sounds like a hell of a party.
- Mm.

25:35.331 --> 25:36.932
Go.

25:53.916 --> 25:55.183
Clear.

25:55.218 --> 25:56.685
Move.

26:10.032 --> 26:11.399
Clear.

26:24.046 --> 26:26.081
Oh, good lord.

26:30.210 --> 26:31.577
12 gauge. Double buck.

26:31.602 --> 26:33.536
It's the Wilkes brothers.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.324
Just a couple kids.

26:44.357 --> 26:46.433
This happened 15 minutes
before we got there.

26:46.458 --> 26:47.759
Had to be a hit.

26:47.793 --> 26:49.476
- Spann is tying up loose ends.
- Yeah.

26:49.501 --> 26:52.240
- Any idea who the shooter was?
- No. Not yet,

26:52.265 --> 26:54.632
but we got patrol
canvassing a ten-block area.

26:54.841 --> 26:56.475
That teenager we saw on a dirt bike

26:56.500 --> 26:57.934
when we were in the van, Sammy Ray...

26:58.216 --> 27:00.594
I ran his plate
and got a hit on a POD camera.

27:00.628 --> 27:02.596
Guess where he was spotted earlier.

27:02.630 --> 27:04.765
A block away
from the Wilkes brothers' house.

27:04.799 --> 27:06.366
Not only did the POD spot him,

27:06.401 --> 27:07.768
but a neighbor
from across the street stated

27:07.802 --> 27:09.937
he saw Sammy run
into the foreclosed home,

27:09.971 --> 27:13.005
jump on a loud bike, and take
off like a bat out of hell.

27:13.875 --> 27:15.676
- All right.
- When Ray was 12,

27:15.710 --> 27:18.545
he used a baseball bat
to put his stepfather in a coma.

27:18.580 --> 27:19.846
Did two years in juvie,

27:19.881 --> 27:21.782
ten months in a psychiatric facility.

27:21.816 --> 27:24.484
Now he runs errands for Spann
from time to time.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.386
Ah, double murder.
That's a hell of an errand.

27:26.421 --> 27:28.388
- You got a location?
- License plate's actually

27:28.423 --> 27:30.624
registered to a Tana Pearson,
Sammy Ray's girlfriend.

27:30.658 --> 27:31.892
Her LKA is in there.

27:31.926 --> 27:34.094
- Hit it.
- You got it, boss.

27:35.997 --> 27:37.698
That's good work.

27:41.002 --> 27:42.970
Chicago PD!

27:43.004 --> 27:45.572
Show me your hands! Show me
your hands! Get out of bed.

27:45.607 --> 27:48.041
Whoa, whoa, wait.
You ain't got no business here.

27:48.076 --> 27:50.577
- This is my home.
- Take her, too.

27:50.612 --> 27:51.912
For what?

27:51.946 --> 27:55.082
Get dressed, Sunshine. Let's go.

27:55.116 --> 27:57.784
Oh, you hit the lottery, huh, Sammy?

28:07.962 --> 28:09.730
Hey.

28:09.764 --> 28:12.833
Did your old boss ever let you
do interviews?

28:12.867 --> 28:14.501
No.

28:15.970 --> 28:17.371
Come on.

28:21.409 --> 28:24.411
The 50 grand we found
at your girl's place

28:24.445 --> 28:27.914
matches serial numbers
on missing cash from the banks.

28:27.949 --> 28:30.017
That's bad news for you.

28:30.051 --> 28:33.020
You're facing a murder for hire charge.

28:33.054 --> 28:35.088
And you're 17 years old.

28:35.123 --> 28:37.858
That's close enough for the
state to charge you as an adult.

28:37.892 --> 28:39.359
But we don't need to go there.

28:39.394 --> 28:42.129
You can tell us what we already know.

28:42.163 --> 28:46.066
Lavar Spann hired you
to kill Bobby and Darren Wilkes.

28:54.909 --> 28:56.943
That was smart, using a gauge.

28:56.978 --> 28:59.646
We couldn't trace the ammo.

28:59.681 --> 29:02.049
But we did recover a 40-ounce
bottle with your prints on it

29:02.083 --> 29:03.984
from the murder scene,

29:04.018 --> 29:06.753
and we have a witness
who saw you fleeing that scene.

29:09.657 --> 29:11.425
I had a 40 with Bobby and Darren.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.894
That don't mean I killed them.
We was friends.

29:15.763 --> 29:19.099
Yeah? What about Spann?
Are you guys friends, too?

29:19.133 --> 29:21.468
'Cause from where we're sitting,
it sure as hell looks

29:21.502 --> 29:23.437
like he set your ass up.

29:25.773 --> 29:28.175
I want a public defender
and a juvenile advocate.

29:28.405 --> 29:30.744
I'm not saying a word
till I get them both.

29:30.913 --> 29:33.835
Why do you want to protect Spann?

29:34.615 --> 29:36.516
For money you're never gonna
get to spend

29:36.541 --> 29:39.636
and a double murder charge
you will not beat?

29:40.955 --> 29:43.457
Come on, Ray.
We know he put you up to this.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.559
Lay it on him.

30:06.481 --> 30:09.049
Darren.

30:09.083 --> 30:10.817
Bobby. Really?

30:13.488 --> 30:15.489
That's Spann.

30:21.929 --> 30:24.664
The guy who was supposedly
looking out for you.

30:27.835 --> 30:29.669
He did that.

30:29.704 --> 30:31.505
He got them killed.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.976
D and B.

30:37.779 --> 30:39.880
We was supposed to...

30:39.914 --> 30:42.883
go to a...

30:42.917 --> 30:46.653
beach in Michigan...

30:46.687 --> 30:49.022
this summer, to kick it.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.628
You know...

30:57.265 --> 31:00.000
Some of us has never been
outside Chicago.

31:00.034 --> 31:02.502
All right.

31:02.537 --> 31:05.939
Be smart, Corey.

31:05.973 --> 31:07.574
Okay? You can do that.

31:07.608 --> 31:09.576
You can have that opportunity.

31:12.947 --> 31:15.849
After what Lavar just done?

31:15.883 --> 31:17.551
I won't make it past next week!

31:17.585 --> 31:20.287
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen.

31:20.321 --> 31:23.690
That's not gonna happen to you.

31:23.724 --> 31:26.526
All right? I'm not gonna
let that happen to you.

31:26.561 --> 31:28.562
I can protect you.

31:28.596 --> 31:30.964
I will protect you.

31:30.998 --> 31:34.568
You're not alone in this anymore.

31:44.612 --> 31:46.146
Corey agreed to give a statement.

31:46.180 --> 31:48.048
His juvenile advocate
signed off on that?

31:48.082 --> 31:50.717
Yeah. She's alerting
the State's Attorney as we speak

31:50.751 --> 31:52.652
so that she can witness
the written statement signed.

31:52.687 --> 31:54.154
- Well played, brother.
- Good job, man.

31:54.188 --> 31:55.889
- Good work.
- How'd you get him to turn?

31:55.923 --> 31:58.124
I mean, he saw
his best friends shotgunned.

31:58.159 --> 32:01.628
That hit him pretty hard. And, uh,

32:01.662 --> 32:03.597
I told him we'll take care of him.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.767
We got Spann.

32:09.770 --> 32:11.204
Mm.

32:14.108 --> 32:16.042
What's the problem?

32:22.617 --> 32:24.251
You know why I brought you down here?

32:24.285 --> 32:27.821
- No.
- This is the only place

32:27.855 --> 32:29.990
in the station
that doesn't have cameras.

32:30.024 --> 32:31.625
Aren't I supposed
to have my advocate with me

32:31.659 --> 32:32.792
if we're gonna talk?

32:32.827 --> 32:33.927
She doesn't need to hear this.

32:33.961 --> 32:35.662
Have a seat.

32:37.298 --> 32:39.225
Son,

32:40.368 --> 32:42.842
if you give us that statement,

32:44.071 --> 32:46.806
you're gonna have to testify
in open court

32:46.841 --> 32:49.276
in front of Lavar Spann.

32:49.310 --> 32:52.279
And we both know what he's capable of.

32:52.313 --> 32:55.181
But Officer Atwater said you
all would be able to protect me.

32:55.216 --> 32:59.619
Yeah, well, I wish
I could guarantee that.

32:59.654 --> 33:04.057
Listen, I am sure
your whole life you've been told

33:04.091 --> 33:06.259
not to trust the police.

33:07.695 --> 33:11.965
Just, please, trust me on this one.

33:11.999 --> 33:14.968
You do not want to open your mouth,

33:15.002 --> 33:18.338
'cause it's gonna end bad for you.

33:18.372 --> 33:21.975
Wait, wait, so you're
telling me not to talk now?

33:22.009 --> 33:26.379
Listen. You agreed to help us.

33:26.414 --> 33:28.381
That's all that matters to me.

33:28.416 --> 33:31.017
Really.

33:31.052 --> 33:35.355
But I am telling you,
all your friends are dropping.

33:37.024 --> 33:38.725
I don't want you to be next.

33:42.363 --> 33:44.864
So, what do I do?

33:44.899 --> 33:49.002
Just tell them you changed your mind.

33:49.036 --> 33:51.271
And don't talk to anyone, okay?

33:51.305 --> 33:53.823
Not your advocate,
not the State's Attorney,

33:54.208 --> 33:56.495
not the police.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.347
Come on. Let's go.

34:08.346 --> 34:10.916
I was told we had an ironclad case,

34:11.081 --> 34:13.248
that this kid was signing a confession.

34:13.283 --> 34:15.685
Apparently this all changed
in the last few minutes.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.687
Corey Jenkins retracted his statement.

34:17.864 --> 34:19.866
- And why is that?
- Who knows?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.424
He's 14. He's scared.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.059
Oh, come on, Hank.

34:23.092 --> 34:25.428
Look, Lavar Spann is the bigger catch.

34:25.588 --> 34:27.630
He brainwashed and recruited these kids.

34:27.664 --> 34:29.197
He orchestrated these robberies.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.366
We've been through this, Sergeant.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.681
- You don't have anything on...
- Yes, we do.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.471
We've got him contributing
to the delinquency of

34:35.931 --> 34:38.447
and distributing alcohol to a minor.

34:38.609 --> 34:41.710
These were taken by Detective Olinsky
on a surveillance operation.

34:41.745 --> 34:44.313
Let me get this straight.
We're sending Lavar Spann,

34:44.348 --> 34:47.382
the man who masterminded
all of this carnage,

34:47.417 --> 34:51.387
back to prison on a parole violation?

34:51.420 --> 34:54.389
Either way, if we can
get Lavar Spann off the street

34:54.424 --> 34:56.659
for however long,
I'd consider that a win.

34:56.693 --> 34:58.661
Might not be worthy
of a press conference,

34:58.695 --> 35:00.763
but it's a win nonetheless.

35:00.797 --> 35:02.331
We should take another run
at Corey Jenkins.

35:02.366 --> 35:03.733
- Won't talk.
- Well, make him.

35:03.767 --> 35:05.568
That's what you do, isn't it, Sergeant?

35:05.602 --> 35:08.237
You were banging co-eds in law school

35:08.272 --> 35:10.106
when I was in the Gang Unit,

35:10.140 --> 35:13.442
so I understand how this works.

35:13.477 --> 35:17.513
That kid snitches, he's dead.

35:17.547 --> 35:19.682
Dead.

35:19.716 --> 35:21.884
So, his testimony's not an option.

35:32.462 --> 35:35.498
Well, we killed one, one wouldn't talk,

35:35.532 --> 35:37.266
and you got the other two.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.268
That's a hell of a theory.

35:39.303 --> 35:43.172
But I only had two years left on
my sentence when I was paroled.

35:43.206 --> 35:46.609
Even if I'm violated,
and they make me do every day,

35:46.643 --> 35:49.378
it ain't gonna be nothing
but a vacation for me.

35:49.413 --> 35:51.213
I'll be out in 18 months.

35:51.248 --> 35:53.149
Yeah, and I'm gonna have
a unit sitting on you

35:53.183 --> 35:56.552
every second.

35:56.586 --> 35:58.888
They're gonna be waking you up
and tucking you in,

35:58.922 --> 36:00.823
and when you...

36:00.857 --> 36:02.858
when you spend the first dollar
of that bank's money...

36:02.893 --> 36:06.162
and you will...

36:06.196 --> 36:07.930
you'll see me again.

36:24.448 --> 36:27.350
Come on.

36:29.953 --> 36:33.322
Listen, when you get in there,
keep your head down, okay?

36:33.357 --> 36:36.559
Do your time. Get your GED or something.

36:36.593 --> 36:37.893
Just... just make a plan.

36:37.928 --> 36:39.829
Hey, look at me.

36:39.863 --> 36:42.665
When you get out,
me and Sergeant Voight will

36:42.699 --> 36:46.168
make something happen for you, okay?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.704
Okay.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.242
You're mad I didn't make a statement.

36:52.275 --> 36:55.211
No. I get it.

36:56.713 --> 36:58.748
Believe me.

37:17.634 --> 37:18.934
Yeah.

37:18.969 --> 37:20.970
Halstead said you wanted to see me.

37:21.004 --> 37:24.206
Well, I got three bank robbers
dead, one going to juvie,

37:24.241 --> 37:28.244
and only $50,000
of the bank's cash recovered.

37:28.278 --> 37:29.545
I'd love to give you your case back

37:29.579 --> 37:30.980
to run through your typewriter,

37:31.014 --> 37:34.550
but I'm not sure
there's much of a case left.

37:34.584 --> 37:36.619
I'll be happy to type it up either way.

37:47.631 --> 37:50.266
What you did for Corey Jenkins,

37:50.300 --> 37:53.736
protecting him by denying
his confession,

37:53.770 --> 37:55.738
I don't know many,

37:55.772 --> 37:58.374
if any, cops that would do that.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.917
You know, I got an officer on furlough.

38:07.951 --> 38:10.586
Could use another hand around here.

38:13.990 --> 38:17.560
I'm saying I got a spot open
in Intelligence if you want it.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.401
Open or closed?

38:27.671 --> 38:29.305
Open.

38:44.754 --> 38:48.491
You don't remember me, do you?

38:48.525 --> 38:50.626
I try my best, but I can't remember

38:50.660 --> 38:51.994
every copper that comes through here.

38:52.028 --> 38:53.729
Don't take it personally, Detective.

38:53.763 --> 38:55.965
February 9, 2003,

38:55.999 --> 38:59.802
you answered a call
at Nico's Diner on Adams.

38:59.836 --> 39:02.705
This guy came in with a .357,
pistol-whipped the owner

39:02.739 --> 39:05.341
when he was closing up,
almost killed him.

39:05.375 --> 39:08.644
All for $272.57.

39:08.678 --> 39:10.412
In Greek Town?

39:10.447 --> 39:13.516
Well, yeah, I was working
Robbery-Homicide.

39:14.751 --> 39:16.652
Sergeant, I've never met you as a cop,

39:16.686 --> 39:18.521
but I did meet you as a little girl.

39:21.525 --> 39:24.326
The owner was your father,

39:24.361 --> 39:25.828
and you were with him.

39:25.862 --> 39:27.830
I used to work the register
after school,

39:27.864 --> 39:30.320
help my parents close up.

39:30.634 --> 39:33.102
The offender broke
my father's eye socket,

39:33.136 --> 39:35.404
gave him 96 stitches,

39:35.438 --> 39:38.841
and then stuck a gun in my face
and stole the night's receipts.

39:38.875 --> 39:40.743
Yeah. I remember this.

39:42.779 --> 39:44.513
I spent the whole night at your desk

39:44.548 --> 39:46.115
until you caught the guy.

39:46.149 --> 39:48.684
I was so scared through all that,

39:48.718 --> 39:51.687
worried if my dad was gonna make it,

39:51.721 --> 39:53.889
but you made me feel safe.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.829
I became a cop because of you.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.113
Discount in there somewhere.

40:18.148 --> 40:20.482
Pace your pesos, dog.

40:20.517 --> 40:22.084
- Lindsay!
- Hey.

40:22.118 --> 40:23.719
Yo.

40:23.753 --> 40:26.088
Just wanted to say happy birthday.

40:26.122 --> 40:28.390
What?

40:28.425 --> 40:29.725
Whoa.

40:29.759 --> 40:31.794
- Jay.
- You didn't have to.

40:31.828 --> 40:34.663
- Oh!
- That stuff's, like, two bills.

40:34.698 --> 40:36.498
- Lucky guy.
- Yeah, most days.

40:36.533 --> 40:38.500
Gabby, we know the policy
about outside liquor.

40:38.535 --> 40:40.002
I'll be opening this at home.

40:40.036 --> 40:42.471
No way. You bring that
in my bar, I get a pour.

40:42.505 --> 40:43.906
- I love the way you think.
- That's my girl.

40:45.775 --> 40:49.578
All right, this is stuff
you sip. Don't chug.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.014
- Okay?
- Just take a little longer.

40:52.048 --> 40:53.148
Do you want some or not?

40:53.191 --> 40:54.958
- Yes.
- All right.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.186
- Um...
- All right.

40:57.220 --> 40:58.787
I'm actually all right.

40:58.822 --> 41:00.656
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna head home.

41:00.690 --> 41:03.394
But happy birthday.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.994
See you guys.

41:08.064 --> 41:10.215
Hey. Erin, wait up.

41:11.034 --> 41:12.835
You okay?

41:16.172 --> 41:18.240
He was only 14.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.654
I'll see you.
