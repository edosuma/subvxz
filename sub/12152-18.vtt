- I think you skipped a groove, darling.
- Cordelia.

chosen some horrible, evil person...

- Connor and Cordy.

get there in time?

Because I'm confused.

- Oh, my God, Cordelia.

- No, she's not dead.

- But you killed it. It's dead, right?

now, it's some form of enchantment.

09:17.373 --> 09:19.682
- Then you've been here before?
WOMAN: Yes.

09:19.853 --> 09:22.731
In the beginning,
before the time of man.

09:22.893 --> 09:25.612
Great beings walked the Earth.

09:26.493 --> 09:29.451
Untold power emanated
from all quarters.

09:29.613 --> 09:33.003
The seeds of what would come
to be known as good and evil.

09:33.893 --> 09:37.010
But the shadows stretched
and became darkness...

09:37.173 --> 09:39.767
...and the malevolent
among us grew stronger.

09:39.933 --> 09:41.969
The Earth became a demon realm.

09:42.333 --> 09:45.086
Those of us who had
the will to resist...

09:45.253 --> 09:46.606
...left this place.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.123
But we remained ever watchful.

09:49.293 --> 09:52.126
You're a Power that was?

09:52.853 --> 09:56.482
But then something new emerged
from deep inside the Earth.

09:56.653 --> 09:59.645
- Neither demon nor god.
- Man.

10:00.613 --> 10:04.401
And it seemed for a time
that through this new race...

10:04.573 --> 10:07.610
...a balance might be restored.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.968
Guess we really let you down.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.732
But you didn't.

10:11.973 --> 10:14.533
It was we who failed you.

10:15.213 --> 10:17.966
We became little more than observers.

10:18.133 --> 10:21.170
I could no longer bear to just watch.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.971
All the suffering...

10:23.133 --> 10:25.601
...I had to find a way back.

10:25.773 --> 10:28.128
But first I needed a miracle.

10:28.893 --> 10:31.361
And so I arranged one.

10:34.173 --> 10:36.050
Through you, Angel.

10:36.213 --> 10:37.532
Through Darla.

10:37.853 --> 10:40.003
That is where my parentage began.

10:40.173 --> 10:44.451
Two vampires. Creatures once human,
corrupted by darkness.

10:44.613 --> 10:46.285
And you with a soul.

10:46.453 --> 10:48.523
A miracle already.

10:50.293 --> 10:52.648
- But how?
- Through Lorne.

10:52.813 --> 10:54.292
Huh?

10:54.453 --> 10:59.163
The day Lorne sent Angel
and human Darla into the trials...

10:59.333 --> 11:01.130
...to earn a new chance at life.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.932
- I failed.
WOMAN: No.

11:04.093 --> 11:07.005
You earned that life,
and there it is.

11:07.333 --> 11:13.169
All these events unfolded that I
might re-enter this physical plane.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.409
I know there's been chaos.

All the events we've witnessed these
past months, all the madness...

11:19.893 --> 11:21.485
...it was birth pains.

- But the storm has passed.
- And here comes the sun.

We have nothing to fear.

13:06.573 --> 13:08.006
Okay.

13:09.653 --> 13:12.167
Now, what are we going to call me?

13:13.413 --> 13:14.926
You don't have a name.

13:15.293 --> 13:16.692
No.

13:17.253 --> 13:19.323
You should have a name.

13:19.693 --> 13:20.967
Yes.

13:21.893 --> 13:23.565
I don't know.

13:23.733 --> 13:28.761
I can't imagine one word,
you know, summing you up.

I mean, you're a superior being.
Shouldn't you...?

13:33.533 --> 13:35.728
Don't you want
to choose it yourself?

13:36.093 --> 13:38.891

can choose their own name.

They're named

13:41.933 --> 13:44.652
There are some rules
even I must follow.

13:48.533 --> 13:51.331
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

13:51.533 --> 13:55.924

I should have listened.

14:55.013 --> 14:57.243
I'll be all right.

14:57.693 --> 14:59.888
Everything will be all right.

15:00.053 --> 15:05.411
All my life, so empty.
That's over now, isn't it?

15:05.573 --> 15:08.610
Yes, Margaret, it's over.

15:09.813 --> 15:11.087
I know you.

15:11.693 --> 15:12.967
I know you all.

15:13.133 --> 15:16.648
I've come here for you,
to bring you the gift of peace.

15:16.813 --> 15:20.203
You will be freed from
the pains you've suffered.

15:20.373 --> 15:25.163
The world will change forever, and you
will know the power of my love.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.928
The chaos will fade
and harmony will reign.

15:29.093 --> 15:30.685
Monster.

15:32.253 --> 15:34.084
It has to die!

15:51.253 --> 15:53.926
Angel, that's enough.

15:58.413 --> 16:00.404
[MAN SOBBING]

16:00.613 --> 16:02.524
Don't you see it?

16:05.173 --> 16:06.492
No.

16:07.453 --> 16:09.683
No, don't touch me!

16:11.973 --> 16:13.645
WOMAN:
Poor thing.

16:17.053 --> 16:20.090
- Wesley.
- I'll call an ambulance.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.364
All of you...

16:23.573 --> 16:27.202
...so loving, so strong.

16:27.893 --> 16:33.331
How can I ask you to understand
that a man like this...

16:33.893 --> 16:38.409
...so full of fear, anger, so alone...

16:38.573 --> 16:40.564
...he will always be alone.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.247
But we have found each other.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.170
What about "Helen"?

16:49.013 --> 16:51.402
- Helen.
- That's got a ring.

16:51.573 --> 16:53.165
Yes, it does.

16:53.813 --> 16:59.570
However, something along
the lines of Dianthia or Iphigenia.

16:59.733 --> 17:04.329
- Those are some long lines.
- Or Aristophila, which means...

17:04.492 --> 17:07.132
"Supreme lover of mankind."

17:07.693 --> 17:08.967
That's lovely.

17:09.453 --> 17:11.647
Well, Helen was my grandma's name.

17:12.333 --> 17:15.211
- Helen is beautiful as well.
- All right, what about...?

17:15.613 --> 17:16.932
FRED:
Clorox.

17:17.853 --> 17:21.084
Clorox. She bleaches away the hate.

17:21.733 --> 17:26.761
- Probably best we avoid brand names.
- No, I meant this shirt.

17:27.133 --> 17:30.569
- I know I can get this stain out.
- It's not important, Fred.

17:30.733 --> 17:34.772
No, it is. I can make it
good as new again.

17:34.933 --> 17:38.005
There's really no need.
It's just a shirt.

17:38.173 --> 17:39.686
But it's yours.

17:40.173 --> 17:41.845
And it was on you.

17:42.573 --> 17:44.484
On your holy body-ness.

17:45.493 --> 17:51.011
- And it's my fault you were attacked.
- Nonsense. There is no fault.

17:51.493 --> 17:54.212
It was a new and vivid experience.

17:54.733 --> 17:57.805
To be able to bleed, feel things...

17:57.973 --> 18:01.409
...anything, even pain, is a gift.

18:03.893 --> 18:09.286
- You take your senses for granted.
- Club soda.

18:10.133 --> 18:11.851
May as well let her do her thing.

18:12.013 --> 18:16.052
Yes, Fred can be quite single-minded
when she's focused on a problem.

18:16.213 --> 18:19.046
- Yeah.
- You love her very much.

18:21.493 --> 18:23.245
Both of you.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.803
Don't you see?

18:27.973 --> 18:29.884
You both have the same love.

18:30.173 --> 18:34.644
It should bring you closer together,
not drive you apart.

18:40.973 --> 18:42.611
I'm sorry you were hurt.

18:45.813 --> 18:48.532
- But there was so much blood.
- I heal quickly.

18:48.893 --> 18:51.885
It must be a benefit
of being a former Power, I guess.

18:52.213 --> 18:56.126
What was wrong with that man?
Why did he want to hurt you?

18:57.613 --> 18:59.649
I'm not sure.

19:01.853 --> 19:04.572
Some people can't accept change.

19:04.813 --> 19:08.362
It scares them,
and that fear becomes hatred...

19:08.533 --> 19:11.001
...and they take that hatred
out on others.

19:12.613 --> 19:16.128
Or sometimes on themselves.

19:17.613 --> 19:22.607
That fragrance, it's lovely.
What is it?

19:23.533 --> 19:25.808
Must be the jasmine.

19:26.613 --> 19:28.092
Night-blooming.

19:28.933 --> 19:32.130
So beautiful, so Lonely.

19:33.253 --> 19:35.084
Like you.

19:36.413 --> 19:38.881
- I shamed you.
- No.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.771
I did.

19:40.933 --> 19:43.288
I almost killed that man.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.643
- I think I would have if...
- Angel...

19:45.813 --> 19:50.409
...you were only trying to protect me.
There can be no shame in that.

19:53.133 --> 19:55.727
I don't want to fail you again.

19:56.573 --> 19:58.291
Then don't.

19:59.053 --> 20:00.964
It's not that simple.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.407
Why isn't it?

20:03.893 --> 20:05.565
Because...

20:06.053 --> 20:08.487
...what I'm feeling...

20:08.853 --> 20:13.005
You must let go of your anger
towards that poor soul.

20:13.173 --> 20:15.482
No, not anger.

20:17.253 --> 20:18.732
Happiness.

20:20.693 --> 20:24.163
- I'm so happy that you're here.
- And that's a problem?

20:24.333 --> 20:26.688
For me, yes.

20:27.413 --> 20:29.768
If I get too happy...

20:30.893 --> 20:35.648
...if I allow myself to feel
what I'm feeling, Angelus might...

20:35.813 --> 20:37.087
I know.

20:38.613 --> 20:41.810
But soon, none of that will matter.

20:43.013 --> 20:46.528
Evil will be banished
by the deeds we will do, Angel.

20:47.653 --> 20:49.689
Even the evil that's inside of you.

20:49.853 --> 20:54.973
That, too, will be gone,
and all that will be left is the beauty.

20:57.013 --> 20:59.811
- Eradicate all evil.
- Yes.

21:01.573 --> 21:03.609
Is that even possible?

21:03.933 --> 21:08.529
- We've been fighting for so long.
- I know. I've seen it all.

21:08.693 --> 21:11.366
That's why I've come back.

21:15.653 --> 21:17.644
You are my general.

21:18.133 --> 21:20.124
I have faith in you.

21:21.533 --> 21:26.561
You have faith in me.

21:27.533 --> 21:33.688
I have faith in all my warriors.
Each and every one of you.

21:33.853 --> 21:36.128
You are all up to the task.

21:42.573 --> 21:44.404
<i>You're not alone anymore.</i>

21:44.573 --> 21:47.929
<i>I will be with you everywhere you go.</i>

21:52.733 --> 21:54.849
<i>I'll be at your side.</i>

22:02.493 --> 22:05.053
<i>Guiding your hands.</i>

22:10.173 --> 22:12.448
<i>Giving you strength.</i>

22:14.093 --> 22:18.052
<i>With my help, all things are possible.</i>

22:20.253 --> 22:23.290
<i>There will be no doubt...</i>

22:24.933 --> 22:27.049
<i>... no worry...</i>

22:28.613 --> 22:30.843
<i>... no fear...</i>

22:31.333 --> 22:34.643
<i>... for you will know</i>
<i>you cannot be beaten.</i>

22:34.933 --> 22:38.005
TV REPORTER: <i>After several weeks</i>
<i>of skyrocketing homicide rates...</i>

22:38.173 --> 22:41.848
<i>... finally this week, a dramatic decrease</i>
<i>in Southland murders.</i>

22:42.013 --> 22:44.607
<i>The sheriff's department</i>
<i>attributes it to their new...</i>

22:44.773 --> 22:48.129
<i>... Tough on Crime policy</i>
<i>instituted last month...</i>

22:48.733 --> 22:52.692
A little credit for the Divinity
Behind the Scenes policy wouldn't suck.

22:52.853 --> 22:56.050
It's not important who gets credit.
What matters is we're winning.

22:56.293 --> 22:59.842
- Lf we keep going at this rate...
- L.A.'s gonna be a no-demon zone.

23:00.013 --> 23:01.492
Hello, Garden City.

23:01.653 --> 23:04.486
You never doubted us. Not for a second.

23:04.653 --> 23:07.645
There's no room for doubt, Angel.
Only love.

23:09.133 --> 23:11.010
Hey, we made the news.

23:11.173 --> 23:13.528
"Dramatic decrease
in Southland murders this week."

23:13.693 --> 23:16.048
Hey, so much
for that nagging Apocalypse.

23:16.213 --> 23:22.448
But, hey, speaking of dramatic, I've got
a smidgen of a surprise for you upstairs.

23:22.613 --> 23:26.765
Surprises, they're one of my
favorite things about being human.

23:27.853 --> 23:29.127
- Isn't she...?
- Yeah.

23:29.293 --> 23:35.448
- A miracle.
- Well, I tried. What do you think?

23:36.013 --> 23:37.571
It looks brand-new.

23:39.173 --> 23:40.686
It is.

23:43.373 --> 23:45.807
I bought a new one.

23:47.733 --> 23:49.166
Even better.

23:51.213 --> 23:52.726
I know.

23:53.053 --> 23:54.645
Well, what's the matter?

23:55.173 --> 24:01.169
- She'll love it.
- I know, but she's not here.

24:01.333 --> 24:02.812
She's just upstairs.

24:03.053 --> 24:07.410
Yes, but when she's not around...

24:08.133 --> 24:09.930
...I hurt.

24:14.413 --> 24:16.005
WOMAN:
Oh, Lorne.

24:16.173 --> 24:22.089
It's too diva, isn't it?
Diva, deity. It's a thin line.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.050
It's lovely.

24:24.333 --> 24:27.370
There's that wonderful smell again.

24:27.533 --> 24:28.807
Jasmine.

24:28.973 --> 24:31.726
Oh, really, Lorne.
It's more than I could ask for.

24:32.253 --> 24:37.407
Oh, well, I'm as tickled as someone
so tickled they're out of similes.

24:37.733 --> 24:42.761
- Well, I'll let you have your privacy.
- Thank you again, Lorne.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.723
You're troubled.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.291
Come in, Connor.

24:53.453 --> 24:55.011
Tell me what's bothering you.

24:57.813 --> 24:59.132
I...

25:03.093 --> 25:04.731
I can't.

25:05.493 --> 25:08.849
Of course you can.
You can tell me anything.

25:10.253 --> 25:12.369
Cordelia used to say that to me.

25:13.453 --> 25:14.727
It's just...

25:15.333 --> 25:17.563
...having you here...

25:18.333 --> 25:21.723
...I finally know why I was created.

25:21.933 --> 25:24.003
For you. To help bring you here.

25:24.173 --> 25:25.686
That and so much more.

25:25.853 --> 25:27.127
But...

25:28.493 --> 25:29.892
...I don't deserve...

25:32.813 --> 25:34.883
I shouldn't be so happy.

25:35.373 --> 25:38.729
I've done things. I've betrayed
my dad, hurt people.

25:38.893 --> 25:41.202
I know. All of it.

25:41.373 --> 25:45.082
I've watched you,
not just these past days...

25:45.253 --> 25:47.721
...but all your life, and before.

25:48.853 --> 25:51.083
You deserve all the happiness
I can bring you.

25:58.893 --> 26:00.406
Why me?

26:01.733 --> 26:05.408
I needed a unique soul
to help create me.

26:06.333 --> 26:07.607
Yours.

26:08.573 --> 26:11.883
Even before you were born,
I chose you to be my father.

26:12.413 --> 26:15.291
And now we're going
to transform the world.

26:16.653 --> 26:18.644
But my father, he's the champion.

26:18.813 --> 26:24.763
Everything has its season.
It's your time, Connor, your destiny.

26:26.093 --> 26:30.052
Hi. I know it's not the exact
same shirt, but it's pretty close.

26:30.253 --> 26:33.928
I scrubbed the other one until my
fingers bled, but I couldn't get out the...

26:37.693 --> 26:39.012
Blood!

26:45.813 --> 26:48.885
WOMAN:
Fred, is something wrong?

26:51.973 --> 26:54.168
[SOBBING]

26:55.133 --> 26:57.169
I'm sorry.

26:58.093 --> 27:01.449
- I'll get her some water.
- No, don't.

27:01.893 --> 27:04.771
I mean, I'll be fine.

27:04.933 --> 27:06.571
GUNN:
Sounds like someone's...

27:08.533 --> 27:10.728
What's all the booing and hooing,
sweet pea?

27:10.893 --> 27:13.726
Fred, there's no reason to cry.
She's right there.

27:13.893 --> 27:17.886
I know. It's just that I started
thinking about what...

27:18.053 --> 27:20.521
...it would be like if you weren't here.

27:22.613 --> 27:24.285
I guess I kind of lost it.

27:24.453 --> 27:26.728
I'm not going anywhere, Fred.

27:27.893 --> 27:29.485
You can trust in that.

27:29.893 --> 27:33.852
I think I just need
some time alone to...

27:34.213 --> 27:35.692
...you know...

27:36.333 --> 27:41.851
...count my blessings because
there are so many, and it's good...

27:43.373 --> 27:45.329
...to take stock.

27:51.373 --> 27:52.772
FRED:
Cordelia?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.686
It's me.

27:57.653 --> 27:59.291
I'm here.

28:00.173 --> 28:01.606
Hello?

28:05.173 --> 28:07.812
Remember before the big brain suck...

28:07.973 --> 28:13.001
...when Lorne read you, and it was
all scary, headachy pukiness?

28:15.813 --> 28:18.088
Well, what if that's all true?

28:19.093 --> 28:22.768
Only worse, because we
don't even know to fight back.

28:23.293 --> 28:25.011
Not even Angel.

28:28.693 --> 28:30.092
Cordelia...

28:30.253 --> 28:33.245
...I wish you could...
ANGEL: I know what you're thinking.

28:36.573 --> 28:38.006
You do?

28:38.173 --> 28:40.403
Sometimes when I look in her eyes...

28:41.253 --> 28:43.050
...I've seen it too.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.531
It's overwhelming.

28:45.693 --> 28:48.651
The lies, the deceit...

28:50.533 --> 28:52.251
...it just melts away.

28:52.773 --> 28:55.207
Nothing left but the beauty.

28:56.133 --> 28:57.452
Um...

28:58.453 --> 29:00.523
Yeah...

29:01.453 --> 29:03.569
...it's incredible.

29:09.693 --> 29:11.570
I can't believe I almost...

29:18.093 --> 29:19.845
Seems like a lifetime ago.

29:22.493 --> 29:26.281
It's all so different
from what we expected.

29:26.453 --> 29:29.092
Big, hideous evil,
trying to end the world?

29:29.813 --> 29:31.610
Nice to be wrong.

29:33.013 --> 29:39.361
Yeah, and now that she's here,
everything just seems so easy.

29:39.813 --> 29:43.123
I know. Feels like a dream.

29:43.493 --> 29:46.166
But have you noticed
how we all just kind of...

29:46.813 --> 29:50.567
...do what she says,
don't ask questions?

29:52.013 --> 29:53.890
Isn't it a relief?

29:54.053 --> 29:56.009
The constant questioning...

29:57.493 --> 29:59.643
...it's finally over.

30:16.253 --> 30:20.451
Hi. Yes. I'm looking for a patient,
a man.

30:20.613 --> 30:22.524
He was brought in Thursday,
named Stover.

30:22.693 --> 30:23.967
Are you a family member?

30:24.213 --> 30:29.082
Am I? Yes. I have a family.
I'm a member.

30:31.013 --> 30:33.163
L...
He's my brother.

30:33.493 --> 30:36.007
Father. My father's brother.

Please, I need to know if he's all right.

30:54.013 --> 30:55.731
Dr. Counts treated him.

30:56.053 --> 30:59.966
- Is he still here?
- He was transferred to...

John, I have to ask you,
do you have a history of mental...?

What I mean to ask is...

31:53.853 --> 32:00.167
...have you been
in this particular ward before?

32:00.333 --> 32:02.051
You mean, am I crazy?

32:02.453 --> 32:03.727
Well...

32:04.733 --> 32:06.610
...were you before Thursday?

32:07.053 --> 32:09.362
Leave me alone.

32:10.013 --> 32:11.969
I don't think you're crazy.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.406
I think I know what happened.

32:18.733 --> 32:22.203
I think I know what you saw...

32:23.533 --> 32:25.330
...because I saw it too.

32:28.053 --> 32:30.248
- The woman you attacked...
- Not a woman.

32:30.413 --> 32:34.691
Her face, it's horrible, isn't it?

32:34.853 --> 32:39.290
- Decay, blood, things living there.
- You did see it?

32:39.453 --> 32:41.648
- Yes.
- Did it touch you?

32:42.533 --> 32:44.489
What?

32:45.453 --> 32:47.523
Don't let it touch you.

32:53.453 --> 32:55.842
She did that to you?

32:57.653 --> 33:02.010
Untie me, please. I have to get
out of here. I have to finish it.

33:02.173 --> 33:06.644
- Finish what?
- She has to die. We have to kill it.

33:06.813 --> 33:11.682
We? No, I mean, maybe, but no.

33:11.853 --> 33:13.809
- You said you saw it.
- I did.

33:13.973 --> 33:16.851
- Then you've been called too.
- Called?

33:17.013 --> 33:19.891
Called to the mission.

33:20.053 --> 33:21.327
Called?

33:22.413 --> 33:27.931
No, I don't get called.
I'm not the called type.

33:28.093 --> 33:33.292
I, you know, take messages
for my boss. He gets called.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.926
- Called?
- It's our duty. Others won't see.

33:39.093 --> 33:40.367
You're wrong.

33:40.533 --> 33:45.084
If what we saw is true, there are people
who will understand, who will help.

hey, hey, pumpkin, where you been?

34:24.572 --> 34:27.451
Out. What happened?

34:27.612 --> 34:30.172
She went for a walk.
It was like <i>A Hard Day's Night.</i>

Everybody followed her back.
Isn't it fabulous?

Of course.

I went to see that man
from the restaurant.

- The one who...
- The attacker? Why?

35:07.573 --> 35:10.167
That's what I wanted to know,
why he would do that.

We both saw something.

I needed to know if it
was the same something.

it's not what I would have wanted.

Once he had her there, he
must have monkeyed with her brain.

Maybe he made her do it,
with magic or something.

everything we're trying to create...
