00:29.000 --> 00:33.600
Gaze into the crystal ball
of a fortune teller.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.520
They say it offers a glimpse
into the future.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.320
I see that Kiki has
an incredible voice,

00:43.320 --> 00:46.320
and she'll someday
be a famous singer.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.400
Cool.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.120
Betty Ann's compassion
and intelligence

00:52.120 --> 00:54.560
will lead her to a
successful career in medicine.

00:54.560 --> 00:55.760
Really?

01:01.640 --> 01:04.840
Stig will be a
professional wrestler.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.280
Yes!

01:12.120 --> 01:13.560
Sam's love for adventure

01:13.560 --> 01:15.360
will make her
a famous explorer,

01:15.360 --> 01:17.560
maybe searching
the ocean depths

01:17.560 --> 01:19.560
where no one
has gone before.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.240
I like this game.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.560
And Tucker.

01:23.560 --> 01:24.760
Hmm.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.800
He'll clean elephant
cages at the zoo.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.280
Hey, what does
that thing say

01:30.280 --> 01:32.520
for you, smart guy?

01:34.440 --> 01:36.040
I see in my future

01:36.040 --> 01:37.640
a story.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.040
A story about
looking into the future.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.040
Imagine if a crystal ball
really worked?

01:43.040 --> 01:45.560
Wouldn't it be cool to see
what was going to happen to you

01:45.560 --> 01:47.560
tomorrow, or next week,

01:47.560 --> 01:49.320
or 5 years from now?

01:53.040 --> 01:54.560
The only trouble is

01:54.560 --> 01:56.040
what if the future you saw

01:56.040 --> 01:57.560
wasn't a good one?

01:57.560 --> 02:00.560
What if it was filled
with fear and danger?

02:00.560 --> 02:03.880
Would seeing a horrible future
mean you could change it,

02:03.880 --> 02:05.480
or would it mean you had to
live with the knowledge

02:05.480 --> 02:07.000
that you were doomed,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.720
and all you could do
was wait for it to happen?

02:09.720 --> 02:12.160
Submitted for the approval

02:12.160 --> 02:13.880
the Midnight Society,

02:13.880 --> 02:16.160
I call this story...

02:27.920 --> 02:30.520
Natalie Miller.
She'd say yes.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.520
She looked at me

02:31.520 --> 02:32.680
in the library
yesterday.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.160
What do you think?

02:34.160 --> 02:35.960
I don't know. I don't
know either of them.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.800
Hey Michael,
get out of there!

02:38.800 --> 02:40.440
You're not supposed
to go in there.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.640
What are you,
mom's spy?

02:42.640 --> 02:43.800
[Boys giggle]

02:45.200 --> 02:47.040
Wanna buy
a little brother?

02:47.040 --> 02:49.080
Nah, I already
got a lizard.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.520
Hey, what's
he doing in there?

02:50.520 --> 02:53.120
Eh, it's a dumb club
he's got with his friends.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.560
Whenever they get
a new member,

02:54.560 --> 02:56.280
they bring him
in there and scare him.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.240
Like an initiation.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.000
Cute.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.520
Maybe Beth Elliot.
She'd go.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.160
Yo, Justin.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.360
Beth's cool.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.760
So, do you believe that
stuff about the Albert house?

03:13.760 --> 03:16.560
What? Old Mr. Albert
haunts the place?

03:16.560 --> 03:18.040
I can't
believe that.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.480
So, uh--who are you
gonna ask to the dance?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.960
I--I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.600
Yeah, great.
You'll never ask anybody.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.440
You choke every time
you look at a girl.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.440
I do not.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.440
Do to.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.960
Do not.
Do to.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.240
Do not.
Do to!

03:38.800 --> 03:40.960
Excellent.

03:43.680 --> 03:44.600
Hmm?

03:44.600 --> 03:45.640
Get lost, will ya?

03:45.640 --> 03:46.880
Why?

03:46.880 --> 03:48.680
'Cause I don't want
an audience. Now go.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.520
Man, I'd give anything
for the guts to do that.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.600
What was that?

04:04.600 --> 04:06.080
I didn't quite hear.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.960
You'd give anything
for what?

04:08.960 --> 04:10.400
Nothing.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.000
Wait. Don't be shy.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.320
Certainly there must be
something I can interest you in.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.279
Have you seen
our vomit?

04:18.279 --> 04:20.399
Who are you?

04:20.399 --> 04:24.400
They call me--Sardo.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.800
No Mr.,
accent on the "do".

04:27.800 --> 04:30.520
And you are?

04:30.520 --> 04:34.520
Justin. No rules,
just plain Justin.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.920
So, what are
you looking for,

04:35.920 --> 04:37.440
just plain Justin?

04:37.440 --> 04:39.480
Nothing you can
help me with.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.160
Try me.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.040
OK, I got
this thing with girls.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.440
Don't we all.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.920
No. I'm nervous
about asking anybody out.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.400
I'm scared
they're gonna say no,

04:49.400 --> 04:51.680
and I'll look
like a total geek.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.920
I have exactly
what you need!

04:53.920 --> 04:55.600
You're kidding.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.480
I never kid.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.360
I have just the thing to
help you solve your problem.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.600
[Mumbling]

05:08.600 --> 05:11.240
Thanks, anyway.
I gotta be going.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.080
<i> Voila!</i>

05:13.920 --> 05:15.000
What is it?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.200
It's...

05:17.200 --> 05:18.840
A door... way.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.480
It's a doorway
into the future.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.440
It's one of a kind.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.840
I got it from
a fortune teller

05:27.840 --> 05:29.080
who fell on hard times.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.120
What's it do?

05:30.120 --> 05:32.120
Well, uh...

05:32.120 --> 05:35.160
You just tell it
what you want to see.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.280
Imagine knowing
beforehand

05:37.280 --> 05:39.360
whether or not
the young lady you ask out

05:39.360 --> 05:41.280
will say yes or no?

05:41.280 --> 05:43.080
[Telephone rings]

Don't move.

05:47.880 --> 05:48.600
[Ring]

05:52.280 --> 05:53.880
Doorway to the future?

05:53.880 --> 05:55.160
Yeah, right.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.360
It's your nickel.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.480
Show me a girl who'll
go to the dance with me.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.800
Rip. It doesn't
even open.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.720
[Banging sound]

06:30.440 --> 06:31.360
I'll take it!

06:31.360 --> 06:32.360
You will?

06:32.360 --> 06:33.560
You will?!

06:33.560 --> 06:35.800
Of course you will!
Why wouldn't you?

06:35.800 --> 06:38.240
After all,
it is one of a kind.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.800
And it's a steal
at uh...

06:41.800 --> 06:43.600
$64.95.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.600
What?

06:44.600 --> 06:46.120
Oh, but wait.

06:46.120 --> 06:50.040
Today's sale day.
It's only $44.95.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.120
I can't afford it.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.800
$24.95?

06:53.800 --> 06:55.240
I've only got $10.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.760
Sold, but I'm
losing on the deal.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.200
<i>OK, OK,
what's the big secret?</i>

07:28.200 --> 07:29.760
This.

07:29.760 --> 07:33.280
It's who I'm
taking to the dance.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.280
I hope you
and your little door

07:35.280 --> 07:36.160
have a great time.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.400
No, no, wait.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.440
I don't get it.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.760
It worked before.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.600
Introduce me later.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.880
I know how doors can
get a little stuck up.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.160
Ben, wait.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.280
Brad.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.160
Brad!

09:19.240 --> 09:20.160

Mr. Sardo?

09:47.240 --> 09:48.160
Mr. Sardo?

09:48.160 --> 09:50.160
That's Sar-do!

09:50.160 --> 09:51.360
Oh.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.520
I thought you said
this was one of a kind?

09:54.520 --> 09:56.320
Eeehhh-yes.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.160
Well--you see, the um...

09:58.160 --> 10:00.480
The doors are uh...

10:00.480 --> 10:01.680
Are a matched set.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.680
And so you see,
they are one of a kind,

10:03.680 --> 10:05.840
both of them.
Sort of.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.160
All right, they're 2
of a kind, so sue me.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.360
I want to know who's on the
other side of that door?

10:10.360 --> 10:11.720
It really works?

10:11.720 --> 10:13.240
I mean uh...

10:13.240 --> 10:14.760
It really works

10:14.760 --> 10:17.160
exactly as I said
it would.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.680
Then who is it?

10:21.640 --> 10:24.600
Why, it looks like...

10:24.600 --> 10:25.840
Like...

10:25.840 --> 10:27.960
Like a strange
little puppet.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.680
I hate this!
It only works for me.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.920
I see.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.200
Well, I'm afraid
that any liability

10:34.200 --> 10:36.200
resulting from
magical doors

10:36.200 --> 10:38.680
is strictly the
responsibility of the owner.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.960
That's you.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.800
That's in the fine print
of any oral contract.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.200
I saw a girl.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.480
Consider yourself lucky.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.800
Good day!

11:03.040 --> 11:04.320
Done deal.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.640
Amy Breck said yes.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.560
You mean
you nagged her

11:08.560 --> 11:10.240
until she couldn't
take it anymore?

11:10.240 --> 11:12.080
Exactly.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.640
So uh--you still going
with your toy door?

11:14.640 --> 11:16.120
It's not a toy.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.640
The guy I bought
it from told me

11:17.640 --> 11:19.120
it shows the future.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.160
Did you see yourself
going to the nut house?

11:21.160 --> 11:22.720
It's no joke, Ben!

11:22.720 --> 11:24.640
I saw a girl
hurt in a fire.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.120
And if that's
really the future,

11:26.120 --> 11:27.520
then somebody's
in a lot of trouble.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.960
And there's
nothing I can do

11:28.960 --> 11:30.040
'cause I don't even
know who she is!

11:30.040 --> 11:31.440
All right, people,
settle down.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.080
Now, before we begin,

11:34.080 --> 11:35.440
I'd like you all
to welcome

11:35.440 --> 11:37.680
a new student
to our school.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.680
Her name is Ashley.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.280
Everyone,

11:41.280 --> 11:43.280
this is Ashley brewer.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.160
[Bell ringing]

12:04.760 --> 12:06.280
Are you OK?

12:06.280 --> 12:08.360
Yeah,
it's just my head.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.160
You're in my class,
aren't you?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.720
Yeah, I'm Justin.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.000
I'm Ashley.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.200
Hi.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.800
Uh--I don't want
to sound weird but...

12:16.800 --> 12:18.040
Can I ask you something?

12:18.040 --> 12:19.040
Sure.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.560
Uh--have you ever
been trapped

12:21.560 --> 12:22.880
in a burning building?

12:22.880 --> 12:25.800
No. What kind of
question is that?

12:25.800 --> 12:26.800
Hey!

12:26.800 --> 12:28.600
Sorry, bro.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.680
Who's the babe?!

12:29.680 --> 12:32.200
I thought you were
too chicken

12:32.200 --> 12:33.400
to talk to girls.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.560
That's no babe,
that's my sister.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.600
Brad!

12:36.600 --> 12:38.600
Oh, well excuse me!

12:41.120 --> 12:43.400
Looks like my brother made
friends with your brother.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.720
Hmm, yeah.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.440
Oh, by any chance, is
your father a firefighter?

12:47.440 --> 12:49.560
Uh, no.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.440
Listen, I'd better go.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.560
Stop being strange
and ask her to the dance.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.080
Forget about
the dance.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.840
I gotta warn her
about the fire.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.360
What a great ice breaker.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.280
Hi, I just saw the future
through a magic door,

13:23.280 --> 13:24.280
and you're doomed.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.560
Wanna go to the dance?

13:25.560 --> 13:27.600
It's not funny. Ashley
might be in trouble.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.840
I hope she has smoke
alarms in her house.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.960
Smoke alarms?

13:32.960 --> 13:34.440
What is it
with you and fire?

13:34.440 --> 13:36.520
Uh--it's kind of
a hobby.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.560
Yeah, yeah.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.320
You know,
fires and smoke alarms.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.520
You can't have
too many smoke alarms.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.800
Yeah.
Thanks for the tip.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.920
Man, you gotta
get over this.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.200
Ashley, we have a
welcome present for you.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.760
Oh, thank you.

13:58.960 --> 13:59.960
No!

14:05.200 --> 14:06.560
Aaahhh!

14:06.560 --> 14:08.920
Are you crazy?!

14:08.920 --> 14:10.160
What did you
do that for?

14:10.160 --> 14:11.160
I thought...

14:11.160 --> 14:12.280
Nice work.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.640
If you can't charm
'em, soak 'em.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.600
Here, wear my jacket
before you freeze.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.920
No! I mean,
don't put that on!

14:19.920 --> 14:21.520
It's OK.
He'll be fine.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.960
Bed rest and a
little warm milk,

14:22.960 --> 14:24.160
and he'll be
good as new.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.520
Ashley, you're in danger
if you wear that!

14:25.520 --> 14:26.720
Don't put it on!

14:26.720 --> 14:29.560
I saw it through my--
my little door.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.160
[Kids laugh]

14:38.400 --> 14:39.840
We all did it,

14:39.840 --> 14:41.320
and if you want
to be one of us,

14:41.320 --> 14:42.320
you'll do it, too.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.440
W-what do
I have to do?

14:44.440 --> 14:46.960
They say old Mr. Alberts
haunts the place.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.960
You gotta go up to
the master bedroom

14:48.960 --> 14:51.360
and sit
in his chair.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.000
In?

15:24.440 --> 15:25.480
[Telephone rings]

15:27.920 --> 15:28.840
Hello?

15:28.840 --> 15:30.720
Uh, is this Justin?

15:30.720 --> 15:32.000
Yeah?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.960
Hi, this is Ashley
from school.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.480
Um--is my brother
there?

15:36.480 --> 15:38.960
Uh--no.
Is he supposed to be?

15:38.960 --> 15:40.400
Well, the little squid
told my mother

15:40.400 --> 15:42.400
he was going to
visit your brother.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.920
She wants him
home for dinner...

15:43.920 --> 15:44.960
Now.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.680
Sorry,
he's not here.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.840
Great. Now I've gotta
go look for him.

15:48.840 --> 15:49.920
Uh--Ashley?

15:49.920 --> 15:51.160
Yeah?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.400
Listen, uh...

15:52.400 --> 15:54.920
I'm really sorry
about today.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.600
And I know it's hard
to believe but...

15:56.600 --> 15:58.400
I'm not
a total lunatic...

15:58.400 --> 15:59.520
Usually.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.760
You're right.
It is hard to believe.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.920
Maybe we could just
forget it ever happened

16:03.920 --> 16:06.200
and start all over again?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.560
I'll think about it.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.160
Listen, I gotta go find
Brad before dinner burns.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.320
See you later.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.920
Burns?

16:12.920 --> 16:15.000
Dinner burning?
Hello, Ashley?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.960
Mary Jo?
Where's Michael?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.360
I'm not
supposed to say.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.640
Says who?

16:39.640 --> 16:42.040
Michael. He thinks
you spy for Mom.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.680
Aahhh!

17:06.680 --> 17:07.520
Aaahhh!

17:15.720 --> 17:16.720
Excellent!

17:22.359 --> 17:23.520
Brad?

17:26.359 --> 17:27.359
Brad?

17:36.880 --> 17:38.520
Brad, are you in there?

17:38.520 --> 17:39.800
Brad!

17:39.800 --> 17:41.160
Man, it's my sister.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.200
Let's bolt.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.760
I'm not spying for Mom.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.800
I just have to
know where he is.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.560
I'll be your best friend.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.240
Give me a break.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.320
Just tell me
where he is,

17:55.320 --> 17:57.320
or Mom's gonna find out

17:57.320 --> 17:59.240
who flushed the corn
cob down the toilet.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.800
He went to do
an initiation.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.320
Initiation?

18:03.320 --> 18:05.000
Like the Albert's house?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.560
Brad.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.160
Brad!

18:34.680 --> 18:35.640
Brad.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.720
Brad.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.160
This isn't the future.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.800
This is right now.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.040
Brad!

19:32.480 --> 19:33.480
Ashley!

19:33.480 --> 19:34.520
Justin?

19:34.520 --> 19:35.880
Look out!

19:35.880 --> 19:36.960
Aahh!

19:36.960 --> 19:39.280
Where did
you come from?

19:39.280 --> 19:40.800
Let's get
out of here.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.120
Aahhh!

20:03.400 --> 20:04.360
It's locked.

20:04.360 --> 20:05.600
We're gonna
suffocate down here.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.240
There's gotta be
a way out.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.400
It's all that
little door's fault.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.400
What little door?

20:16.400 --> 20:18.040
The door
I saw you through.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.000
The key set "in" and...

20:23.800 --> 20:26.560
The key said--"in".

20:26.560 --> 20:28.320
What are you
talking about?

20:28.320 --> 20:31.040
He said it was
one-of-a-kind.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.560
But it isn't.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.240
There's 2.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.960
And if one's
the "in" door...

20:37.880 --> 20:39.720
The other must be
the "out" door.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.600
You really are crazy.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.240
[Justin's voice]
Mr. Sardo, help us!

20:45.240 --> 20:46.240
Help us!

20:46.240 --> 20:49.680
That's Sar-do,
no Mr. accent...

20:49.680 --> 20:51.080
Hurry, please!

20:51.080 --> 20:52.200
[Coughing]

20:54.280 --> 20:55.640
That's it.
I'm changing my name.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.880
It's finally driven me
out of my mind.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.600
Help!

21:04.400 --> 21:06.520
Sardo, help!

21:06.520 --> 21:08.240
Help us open the door!

Who are you?

21:15.520 --> 21:17.160
What do you want?

21:17.160 --> 21:19.960
It's Justin, the kid
you sold the other door to!

21:19.960 --> 21:22.160
We're trapped in here.
Open the door, hurry!

21:22.160 --> 21:23.440
Please!

21:25.320 --> 21:26.880
Nothing happened.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.160
Justin: Use the key
in the sliding panel.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.520
Hurry!

21:31.000 --> 21:32.080
Help us!

21:32.080 --> 21:33.360
Open the door!

21:35.320 --> 21:36.760
I've got it.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.440
This is worth
more than I thought.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.400
Open the door!

[Coughing]

21:53.160 --> 21:55.120
[Coughing]

21:58.440 --> 22:00.840
My, how interesting.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.040
Are you OK?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.360
Yeah, I think.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.840
What happened?

22:09.840 --> 22:10.560
[Ahem]

22:12.200 --> 22:14.920
I don't know whether
this is the right time,

22:14.920 --> 22:17.280
but uh--I don't supposed
I could interest you

22:17.280 --> 22:19.440
in purchasing
the triplet.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.520
The triplet?

22:22.480 --> 22:23.640
Yes.

22:23.640 --> 22:26.800
It's actually 3
of a kind.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.880
Nah, keep it.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.120
<i>[Gary narrating] The magic
door never worked for Justin again.</i>

22:35.120 --> 22:37.280

is magic or not</i>

that can always be said.</i>

<i> Whenever a door is opened,</i>

to new possibilities.</i>

22:43.920 --> 22:45.080
You ready?

22:45.080 --> 22:46.440
Absolutely.

[Door creaking]

The end.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.640
Hey, careful!

22:58.640 --> 23:00.920
Let's see if
I can tell the future.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.560
I see, I see
a guy standing up

23:04.560 --> 23:06.560
and saying,
"I declare this meeting

23:06.560 --> 23:08.600
of the Midnight Society
closed."

23:08.600 --> 23:10.360
I declare this meeting...

23:10.360 --> 23:12.320
Give it to me, Tucker.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.520
Give it to me,
Tucker!

23:14.520 --> 23:17.160
Hey, this thing
really works.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.040
Let me try.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.400
Yeah, you're
right. I see.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.360
I see a little guy.

23:23.360 --> 23:27.160
He's being pounded by
a big guy with glasses.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.000
Ooh, nasty.
