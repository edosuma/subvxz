01:00.400 --> 01:02.500
Move!
I want to see a weapon here...

01:02.700 --> 01:03.500
...and a weapon there!

01:03.700 --> 01:05.700
Sergeant, split your squad!

01:07.000 --> 01:09.100
Set your weapons
for close range.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.800
Laser sight interlock engaged.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.000
You ready to seal the room?

01:16.200 --> 01:18.700
System's armed, sir.
Ready on your order.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.300
Prepare to seal the room
on my count.

01:23.200 --> 01:30.300
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

01:37.600 --> 01:39.900
<I>Attention all personnel...</I>

01:40.200 --> 01:41.900
<I>..the room is sealed.</I>

01:42.100 --> 01:45.500
<I>I repeat,
the room is sealed.</I>

01:46.300 --> 01:48.600
Control two to
building commander...

01:48.800 --> 01:52.100
I'm showing an intrusion
beyond perimeter three.

01:52.600 --> 01:53.900
Moving to check it out.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.800
Sector perimeter three,
scanning...

01:57.700 --> 01:59.100
I see it.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.300
Opening fire now.

02:01.500 --> 02:06.400
Nabel, this thing's been
spotted and targeted already.

02:06.700 --> 02:09.100
Frankly, I was expecting more.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.700
The company's
expecting much more.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.400
Mr. Saggs, if you'll
just be patient...

02:15.400 --> 02:16.700
Must have missed!

02:17.500 --> 02:19.400
Holly molly,
I'm taking shots here.

02:19.700 --> 02:22.500
I'm hit,
I'm hit...

02:24.900 --> 02:27.000
AAV 13, do you copy?

02:27.200 --> 02:29.500
We just lost contact
with command post three...

02:29.700 --> 02:30.800
...outside the second perimeter.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.100
This is command to chopper 4...

02:32.400 --> 02:34.200
...we lost contact with post three.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.700
Can you drop them some
temporary communications gear?

02:36.900 --> 02:38.100
Screw that, command!

02:38.200 --> 02:41.800
You didn't lose contact,
you lost them. Over.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.600
I'm putting rockets in that area,
hear me? Over.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.300
Check your goddamn screens!

02:46.500 --> 02:48.400
Where is he, Nabel?

02:48.700 --> 02:51.600
Heading this way, Mr. Saggs.
He's on his way.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.300
Move the armored
personnel carriers...

02:53.600 --> 02:55.600
...and hopscotch from the
east sector to the west!

02:56.000 --> 02:57.300
And keep them moving!

03:00.200 --> 03:01.800
Lost the dual sensors!

03:04.300 --> 03:06.700
What the hell is that?

03:06.900 --> 03:09.300
Air 4, what the hell is
going on out there?

03:09.500 --> 03:11.000
What are those explosions?

03:11.200 --> 03:12.800
How many of these
things are there?

03:12.900 --> 03:13.700
We're eating it bad!

03:14.000 --> 03:16.200
One.
Repeat, one!

03:18.500 --> 03:19.800
We took a hit...

03:19.900 --> 03:21.900
...hit bad!

03:28.900 --> 03:30.100
Jesus!

03:31.000 --> 03:32.500
<I>Alright everybody, stay cool.</I>

03:32.500 --> 03:35.100
Holly shit!
It's right outside!

03:35.600 --> 03:36.500
<I>Stay cool.</I>

03:37.200 --> 03:39.300
<I>Stay at your work stations.</I>

03:51.900 --> 03:53.900
- Do it!
- Open fire!

04:15.600 --> 04:17.000
Hold your position!

04:17.100 --> 04:19.200
Hold your position, damn it...

04:56.400 --> 04:58.800
This exercise has concluded.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.200
Security stand down.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.300
How many people
know about this?

05:08.600 --> 05:11.600
I'm the only one with the
complete picture, Mr. Saggs.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.200
I split development between
divisions, different planets...

05:15.400 --> 05:16.800
That's why it cost so much.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, it was expensive.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.000
But you know, Nabel, with
enough of these...

05:21.200 --> 05:23.100
...we could take over the world!

05:23.400 --> 05:24.800
Which world?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.700
Earth, Nabel!

05:26.900 --> 05:30.100
The government's been hanging
by a thread for years.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.400
I mean,
with a hundred of these...

05:35.200 --> 05:37.000
How many we got?

05:38.700 --> 05:40.400
Five thousand.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.700
You astonish me!

05:51.300 --> 05:53.300
A particle weapon.

05:53.500 --> 05:57.600
There's nobody within five years of
having anything even remotely like it.

05:59.300 --> 06:03.300
Now...
This thing turns them on and off.

06:03.500 --> 06:06.000
You want to activate them,
you just click here...

06:06.300 --> 06:08.100
...and give them your objectives.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.400
Here...

06:13.100 --> 06:16.300
I assigned your voice primary
command authority.

06:17.500 --> 06:20.000
Nabel, you're a genius!

06:20.200 --> 06:21.400
I'm proud of you!

06:21.600 --> 06:25.300
The company will be
very proud of you!

06:25.900 --> 06:27.900
If circumstances only permitted...

06:28.000 --> 06:30.800
...I would greenlight one great
hellacious bonus for you...

06:31.000 --> 06:33.900
...and a promotion
right on the spot.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.900
But with our objective on Earth...

06:36.000 --> 06:38.400
...you can see
how that precludes it.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.400
I see...

06:40.500 --> 06:41.800
Well I know you would, Nabel...

06:42.000 --> 06:44.700
I mean, after all,
you are a genius.

06:47.100 --> 06:51.300
Of course this all has
to be... deniable.

06:52.400 --> 06:56.300
From which you can unfortunately
infer that you, too...

06:56.700 --> 06:58.700
Have to be deniable.

07:04.900 --> 07:08.200
Destroy Dr. Nabel.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.900
- No!

07:14.200 --> 07:15.600
No!

08:15.800 --> 08:20.200
This is heavy freight
PKF 946...

08:20.600 --> 08:23.000
...requesting clearance
in the Inter Pork docks.

08:23.400 --> 08:27.700
<I>PKF, reduce speed to 1500...</I>

08:28.100 --> 08:31.400
<I>...and contact your corporate
controller on the designated frequency.</I>

08:42.100 --> 08:44.200
This is John Canyon...

08:44.600 --> 08:46.800
...inbound from Mars City...

08:47.800 --> 08:49.000
...calling Inter Pork.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.000
I've got 147 trailers...

08:52.300 --> 08:55.800
...of Mars' finest genetically
squared jacked up hogs...

08:56.100 --> 08:59.400
...which, naturally, I want to
dump as soon as possible.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.900
You got dock open?

09:02.000 --> 09:05.300
<I>Canyon, this is Keller at
Inter Pork packers dispatch.</I>

09:05.600 --> 09:08.500
<I>You're two day past due!</I>

09:09.300 --> 09:11.000
Check out my regrets, pal.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.900
<I>Do you want these hogs
or not, Mr. Keller?</I>

09:13.200 --> 09:14.900
You get them into
C Dock, Canyon!

09:15.100 --> 09:17.500
<I>Park your load
and park your mouth!</I>

09:57.200 --> 09:59.500
Bitchin' Betty,
I'm checking on the cargo.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.000
<I>As you wish, freight driver.</I>

10:04.100 --> 10:06.700
<I>Magnetic floor activated.</I>

10:36.900 --> 10:39.300
How you all doing, huh?

10:51.100 --> 10:52.900
You like that don't you, huh?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.900
Everybody happy?

11:02.700 --> 11:05.900
So... where's my beer
and when do I get paid?

11:06.200 --> 11:08.200
You can unhook
your rig, Canyon.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.100
Stop by the office
in half an hour...

11:10.200 --> 11:11.800
...I'll cut you a check.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.400
I'll unhook when
I got my money, no offense.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.400
You know that's not
company policy.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.700
Yeah, I know that.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.100
That's why it's my policy
not to unhook until I'm paid.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.800
You are late!
Plenty late!

11:25.100 --> 11:26.800
You want I apologize?

11:27.100 --> 11:29.400
I got the hogs here in good shape.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.800
I did it as quick as I could.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
You knew my rig was slow
and you hired me for the job.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.100
I've taken that
into consideration.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.200
And that's the reason I'm willing
to offer you 1,500 credits.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.800
No, no... you owe me 6,000!

11:41.000 --> 11:42.200
You don't seem to get it...

11:42.400 --> 11:45.600
...that I've only offered you the
1,500 out of impulsive generosity!

11:45.900 --> 11:47.700
I think it's time
for you to leave!

11:47.800 --> 11:49.800
You're upsetting my pigs.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.200
Alright, Jackie...

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
Go get him, Jackie!

11:52.600 --> 11:54.100
My pleasure...

11:55.700 --> 11:57.200
No no no, Jackie.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.700
That's not the way to throw
a punch in zero gravity.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.200
See, this is the
recommended technique...

12:11.600 --> 12:12.900
Shit!

12:16.100 --> 12:17.500
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

12:17.700 --> 12:20.500
You're gonna depressurize the
area and kill us all!

12:20.700 --> 12:22.300
Canyon, these hogs
are company property!

12:22.600 --> 12:24.900
They belong to me
until you pay me!

12:25.100 --> 12:26.400
Now get the hell off my rig!

12:26.600 --> 12:28.400
I'm gonna get a court order,
you hear me?

12:28.600 --> 12:30.400
You'll forfeit your right
of any payment!

12:30.600 --> 12:32.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

12:33.100 --> 12:34.100
- Do you hear me?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.200
Hey Cindy.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.600
Hi, John.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.200
Gone only four weeks
this time, huh?

13:24.500 --> 13:25.600
Yeah. I got lucky.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.100
I picked up a load of
square pigs on Mars.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.000
Who is this?

13:31.100 --> 13:32.800
My name is Mike Pucci.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.300
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.900
You are a
space trucker, kid?

13:37.100 --> 13:38.000
Not yet.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.400
He's taking a solo today.

13:39.700 --> 13:40.300
- Oh yeah?

13:40.400 --> 13:43.800
Hey Habib, give me a synthburger
well done and a side of sham fries.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.400
What kind of rig you driving?

13:45.600 --> 13:46.900
Pachyderm 2000.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.500
Pachyderm? Right...

13:48.700 --> 13:51.500
So you've been driving
for a while I guess.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.800
It's hard to beat
that old iron, kid.

13:55.100 --> 13:58.600
Student Mike Pucci
report to area T.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.200
That's me.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.500
Wish me luck, Cindy.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.500
Good luck, Mike

14:02.700 --> 14:03.700
See you.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.500
Who's the kid?
To you I mean.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.400
The customer, like you.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.800
I didn't always use to
be just a customer, huh?

14:16.200 --> 14:18.400
- Hey...
- Sorry, new rules!

14:18.700 --> 14:21.400
They're recycling
all leftovers ok?

14:22.200 --> 14:24.200
Of all the cheap bullshit...

14:25.400 --> 14:28.600
I don't like it any better than you do
but I can't afford to get fired...

14:28.900 --> 14:30.400
...especially now.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.000
What's going on?

14:32.500 --> 14:35.400
Well... you know my
mother's on Earth, right?

14:35.700 --> 14:36.900
Maybe you mentioned it, yeah.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.600
She's gonna have an operation
and it's really serious...

14:39.900 --> 14:42.100
...and I promised that
I'll be there with her.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.200
Oh that's rough, I'm sorry.
So when are you leaving?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.100
Leaving!? You know what
a ticket costs...

14:46.300 --> 14:48.500
I'd have to pull double shifts
here for over a year...

14:48.600 --> 14:50.400
...to earn my way out of here.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.700
- Let me ask around,
see what I can come up with.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.600
You are a good man, John...

14:55.700 --> 14:57.700
...but you are not a company man.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.100
They only give Earth funds
to company people...

15:00.300 --> 15:03.600
...and not of them has the
balls to risk taking me.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.400
God, what I wouldn't give...

15:06.600 --> 15:08.300
You know what I want.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.900
Yeah.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.600
How many times I proposed you?

15:13.800 --> 15:14.600
Three?

15:14.700 --> 15:16.400
I think you left out a few.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.000
Last couple of times
you were pretty loaded.

15:19.300 --> 15:23.200
Tell you what...
You agree to marry me...

15:23.500 --> 15:24.400
I'll get you to Earth!

15:24.600 --> 15:25.000
- Cindy!

15:25.200 --> 15:26.100
- Yeah right!

15:26.400 --> 15:27.900
It's a deal then, huh?

15:28.200 --> 15:30.800
John, you get me to Earth...

15:31.100 --> 15:33.100
...and if you still want to
marry me when we get there...

15:33.400 --> 15:34.700
...I'll do it!

15:34.900 --> 15:36.000
Alright, alright!

15:36.200 --> 15:37.900
I'm gonna get back
to work, okay?

15:40.800 --> 15:41.900
Right.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.500
Sonic pick.
Cool, man.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.300
- Yeah!
- Shhh!

15:57.600 --> 15:59.000
Get the tow truck ready.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.500
I'll unhook the load
and meet you there.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.100
- OK.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.400
Hey, John.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.000
- Oh, hi!
- Still working independent, John?

16:20.300 --> 16:22.300
I still own my own rig,
pick my own loads...

16:22.400 --> 16:24.400
...and don't sell ad
space on my tits...

16:24.500 --> 16:25.900
...if that's what you're
talking about.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.500
You're back for Kev's funeral?

16:28.700 --> 16:29.500
Oh, I didn't hear.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.800
He and his load got
into the scum cluster.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.700
Not much of either came out.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.300
Oh.
Hijackers killed him, huh?

16:36.400 --> 16:37.800
And then some.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.200
Who do you think got him?

16:39.300 --> 16:41.500
Word is that captain Macanudo
stumbled on him.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.300
That guy's a damn depraved animal.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.200
Captured Kevin's load...

16:45.400 --> 16:48.100
All they sent back was his dick.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.700
Using a tennis ball
can for a coffin.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.800
Cremation would've had more
dignity if you ask me.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.500
Anyways, John, we're planning on
having a wake after the service.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.900
Hey John...

17:00.100 --> 17:01.900
You hauled Inter Pork hogs?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.900
Yeah, they're my hogs
until I get paid for 'em.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.200
Would you look at that!

17:07.400 --> 17:09.200
Some piece of garbage
wrapped in human skin...

17:09.300 --> 17:11.599
...is trying to jack my load!

17:26.300 --> 17:27.500
Yeah?

17:28.300 --> 17:30.100
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Keller?

17:30.700 --> 17:34.500
Yeah. I understand you just
graduated from space truck school.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.600
Yeah!

17:35.800 --> 17:37.600
I need someone to push
a shipment of square hogs...

17:37.800 --> 17:39.100
...to Little Chicago on Titan.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.700
Square pigs?

17:41.200 --> 17:43.400
Isn't that John Canyon's load?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.300
It's an Inter Pork load.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.200
I fired Canyon yesterday.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.900
You got a feeling about that
one way or the other?

17:50.300 --> 17:51.700
No.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.800
No, I barely know the guy.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.700
Good.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Cause there's about 1,500 out of work
freight pushers here who want that job.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.500
Yeah, well, I'm the best.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.900
Your potential is frightening.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.200
You want the job?

18:05.300 --> 18:06.600
I'll take it.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.400
Pick up your pink probationary
coveralls from Ammoson Supply.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.300
See you keep them clean!

18:13.400 --> 18:15.100
Pink, huh?

18:15.700 --> 18:17.100
They're pink.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.300
Hey Mike, congratulations!

18:21.600 --> 18:22.600
Thanks.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.900
John!
Mike got himself a new job.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.200
Well, normally we'd have some
kind of blowout for that...

18:30.400 --> 18:33.700
...but I see from your pajamas
who you're working for.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.500
Which is nothing to celebrate.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.400
John, not everyone
can be independent.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.800
Not everyone can drive
their own rig, babe.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.200
John, I'm sorry about you
losing your job, okay?

18:44.400 --> 18:45.800
This is my only shot.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.000
I'm out of money,
I'm out of credit.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.000
Somebody's gotta
get these pigs to Titan.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.000
You took a fearless
world of inventory, kid...

18:57.200 --> 18:59.500
...and then you took my job?

19:00.700 --> 19:02.700
Well, if you can live
with that, great!

19:03.000 --> 19:04.700
But I don't have to!

19:05.000 --> 19:07.200
Now you hump yourself down
at the other end of the ball...

19:07.500 --> 19:10.700
Look, I treat you with respect.
I'm asking you do the same here.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.200
- Keller's here!

19:16.000 --> 19:17.500
Hey look, kid!

19:17.700 --> 19:20.800
Your boss brought
the circus with him!

19:21.100 --> 19:23.300
We've come to pay our respects.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.200
The circus!

19:25.300 --> 19:27.300
A pair of trained turds,
right here!

19:27.600 --> 19:29.100
He's just blowing steam,
Mr. Keller.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.100
This Kev thing's
got people upset.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.000
Slam your teeth, Delia!

19:33.300 --> 19:34.700
I want you off this hub, Canyon!

19:34.900 --> 19:36.500
Oh, I'd like to oblige you...

19:36.700 --> 19:38.400
If you'd paid me,
I'd be gone by now.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.800
We fueled your rig.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.800
Now move your ass down there
and off of this station!

19:42.000 --> 19:43.700
I don't work for you!

19:45.900 --> 19:46.800
Ok!

19:56.200 --> 19:59.600
What? Somebody say something?
Huh?

20:02.200 --> 20:03.700
You don't mess with me, Canyon!

20:04.000 --> 20:06.300
And you never ever
mess with the company!

20:06.500 --> 20:07.600
Now hold on, Mr. Keller...

20:07.800 --> 20:09.000
The man's within
his rights here.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.200
Step off, kid.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.300
Kid's a real space lawyer!

20:25.300 --> 20:27.200
Get the hell away
from me, Canyon!

20:29.400 --> 20:31.800
Mel, Jackie, do something!

20:35.700 --> 20:38.300
Jackie, do something!

20:41.700 --> 20:45.000
<I>Warning, hull breach!
Decompression occurring.</I>

20:45.300 --> 20:46.900
<I>Evacuate the area!</I>

20:46.900 --> 20:49.800
My god!
Somebody help me!

20:51.800 --> 20:54.200
Help me, please!

21:06.900 --> 21:09.600
Jack, come on!

21:19.900 --> 21:20.800
Grab him!

21:20.900 --> 21:23.000
No, Cindy, get out of here!

21:24.600 --> 21:26.100
Cindy, get out!

21:26.200 --> 21:28.100
Save her!

21:32.400 --> 21:35.200
Give me your hand!
Come on!

21:36.600 --> 21:38.100
Come on!

21:53.500 --> 21:54.100
It's the wrong door.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.100
Get in now!

21:55.300 --> 21:56.900
John, it's the wrong door!

22:00.900 --> 22:02.900
Get out!
What are you doing?

22:03.100 --> 22:04.300
John, close it.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.000
- This is occupied!

22:12.200 --> 22:13.100
Nice lady.

22:13.300 --> 22:14.900
Come on in the cubicle,
both of you.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.100
Alright, check the stalls!

22:29.400 --> 22:31.400
<I>Get out!
What are you doing?</I>

22:31.500 --> 22:33.900
<I>Get out!
This is occupied!</I>

22:37.200 --> 22:41.300
This wouldn't be strictly
a social call, would it?

22:41.500 --> 22:44.600
It's always a pleasure
to see you, Mr. Zesty.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.900
I need to get off the hub.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.600
I need a load.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.400
It's problematic, John.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.600
Problematic.

23:02.000 --> 23:07.700
There are people who would like to
see you put down like a diseased dog.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.800
Powerful people.

23:12.400 --> 23:16.100
How about I recite all the
times that I helped you out?

23:16.400 --> 23:19.200
This and that...
Here and there...

23:19.500 --> 23:22.000
An appeal to my
sentimental side?

23:22.200 --> 23:23.700
Yeah.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.400
I shall open my heart at once!

23:27.600 --> 23:30.100
I do have something.

23:30.300 --> 23:32.900
Something unpleasant I fear.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.800
We'll take it.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.300
I'm his partner.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.500
Says who?

23:37.600 --> 23:38.900
What?
You're saying I'm not?

23:39.200 --> 23:41.500
I lost one job because of you.
You owe me!

23:41.800 --> 23:44.100
I stay here, they're gonna
mount my ass on the board!

23:44.300 --> 23:47.200
You are a passenger,
not a partner.

23:47.700 --> 23:50.200
So what've you got,
Mr. Zesty?

23:50.400 --> 23:53.700
It is a rush shipment to Earth.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.500
Two day schedule.

23:55.700 --> 23:59.900
Containers to be left in
high orbit on arrival.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.200
He said Earth.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.800
We'll do it.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.500
What's the cargo?

24:08.700 --> 24:15.600
The manifest states...
Extruded polymer sexual surrogates.

24:16.300 --> 24:17.600
Sex dolls?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.900
They're paying five times
the going rate.

24:21.200 --> 24:25.500
And providing all the
paperwork, forged of course.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.900
But undetectable.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.600
I said... done.

24:30.900 --> 24:34.900
I hesitate to caution
a man of your experience...

24:35.200 --> 24:40.400
...but the consigners of this
cargo were most emphatic...

24:40.800 --> 24:44.200
...that their delivery schedule
be adhered to!

24:44.400 --> 24:45.900
And...

24:46.500 --> 24:49.400
...don't temper with
those containers!

24:51.800 --> 24:54.400
Is this gonna take long?
There's troopers all over the place.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.700
No, I'm almost done.
Do you see her coming?

24:56.800 --> 24:59.100
No. You think the
law grabbed her?

24:59.400 --> 25:01.200
No, she'll make it.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.300
I like her.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.100
She's friendly.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.700
Yeah, she's got
a kindly nature.

25:08.900 --> 25:13.200
You mind if I ask you
what the deal is with Cindy?

25:13.800 --> 25:15.700
I don't get you.

25:16.100 --> 25:17.500
I think she likes me.

25:17.700 --> 25:20.000
I'd like to pursue it further.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.700
I'd like to know
if you're involved.

25:22.900 --> 25:26.300
If I get your drift,
and I do get your drift...

25:26.500 --> 25:29.600
...I must tell you that
a gentleman, Mike...

25:29.900 --> 25:32.800
...a gentleman doesn't answer
a question like that.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.600
That's a no?

25:38.900 --> 25:42.700
Sorry, I'm late. I had to give
them the 30 seconds notice.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.800
Here, help me out.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.000
It's all right.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.700
Geez, my underwear.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.200
I haven't seen this before.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.100
Is this a friend of yours?

25:57.200 --> 26:00.700
Actually that's my mother Carol.
It was taken before I was born.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.100
I can see where you got
your good looks from.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.400
Thanks.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.700
Wouldn't mind meeting
her back then, huh?

26:07.900 --> 26:08.400
- Yeah?

26:08.600 --> 26:09.700
Yeah.

26:14.900 --> 26:15.900
Here we go.

26:49.300 --> 26:50.600
There!

26:54.900 --> 26:57.700
Jeez, I've never seen trailers
like these before.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.500
They look...

27:02.800 --> 27:04.100
- Creepy.

27:04.700 --> 27:07.400
They look like they've come
a long ways already.

27:07.700 --> 27:09.300
What do you think
is in them, John?

27:09.500 --> 27:11.000
I don't.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.900
Something very creepy!

27:24.100 --> 27:26.300
At maximum velocity we're
still gonna be 60 hours...

27:26.500 --> 27:28.600
...the wrong side
of the delivery time.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
If we stay in the shipping lane.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.100
John, you wanna fill me in
on your plans here?

27:35.400 --> 27:37.000
I don't ask you yours.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.000
Look...

27:39.100 --> 27:40.400
We're all in this
together, okay?

27:40.500 --> 27:42.900
I think you owe me and Cindy
the courtesy of an answer here.

27:43.700 --> 27:47.000
<I>All systems functional.
Pressure within acceptable ranges.</I>

27:47.200 --> 27:50.100
<I>Electronic subsystems testing.</I>

27:50.300 --> 27:52.700
John, look, the minute
we pull outta here...

27:52.900 --> 27:55.800
...the transport troopers are gonna
be all over us. Do you get that?

27:56.200 --> 27:57.800
Now you're just gonna have to
learn to live with your fear.

27:57.900 --> 28:01.300
If it gets too bad, breathe into
a paper bag or something...

28:02.500 --> 28:03.900
...but shut up!

28:05.300 --> 28:06.600
Collar yourself!

28:23.900 --> 28:25.900
You better power down, Canyon!

28:26.600 --> 28:28.100
I'm sorry, boys,
I got a...

28:28.400 --> 28:30.700
...priority load of
perishable goods here.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.500
It's not a request!

28:32.600 --> 28:34.700
We got questions about Keller.

28:34.900 --> 28:36.300
Last time I saw him...

28:36.600 --> 28:40.400
...he was being sucked ass
first into the outer darkness.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.400
John, I think these guys
are getting serious.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.400
We better stop.

28:43.700 --> 28:44.600
Yeah!

28:44.700 --> 28:47.000
Not while I still
have an option open.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.500
All units converge!

29:19.800 --> 29:20.800
Abandon pursuit.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.900
Repeat, do not pursue.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.500
We can get them, damn it!

29:24.600 --> 29:26.900
The orders are
to abandon pursuit!

29:27.100 --> 29:28.800
I love taking orders.

29:40.900 --> 29:42.500
Looks like we lost 'em.

29:42.900 --> 29:44.700
More like they
stopped chasing us.

29:44.900 --> 29:47.200
That was some of the best
driving I've ever seen.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.700
Oh thank you.

29:49.900 --> 29:54.200
Just put the pedal to the metal
and play footsie with fate, son.

30:07.300 --> 30:08.800
<I>Breakfast is ready.</I>

30:09.200 --> 30:13.000
Turn your cortexes on up there.
Food's ready.

30:14.100 --> 30:18.700
Mike, Cindy...
Come on.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.900
We on time?

30:29.100 --> 30:30.400
We will be.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.700
We left the space lanes.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.200
About six hours ago.

30:39.800 --> 30:40.700
What is this?

30:40.800 --> 30:43.500
Saliva activated
cappuccino and eggs.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.100
Don't you like it?

30:49.200 --> 30:50.700
What the hell is that?

30:50.800 --> 30:52.800
Some kind of
floating junkyard?

30:55.200 --> 30:57.500
Welcome to the
scum cluster.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.000
What the hell
happened to them?

31:09.200 --> 31:10.800
Asteroids got some of them.

31:10.900 --> 31:13.700
Asteroids?
Where are they?

31:14.000 --> 31:14.900
Where are they?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.100
Yeah, where are they?

31:16.200 --> 31:18.900
<I>Warning!
Density 10 asteroid field.</I>

31:19.300 --> 31:19.900
<I>Freight driver...</I>

31:20.000 --> 31:22.900
<I>You're approaching too fast
for evasive maneuvers.</I>

31:23.200 --> 31:25.200
Don't make me turn
you off, Betty.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.400
John, this shows a big cluster
coming straight ahead.

31:28.600 --> 31:29.700
I don't see anything.

31:29.900 --> 31:32.100
It's got to be a
malfunction, right?

31:37.600 --> 31:39.100
It's black rock!

31:39.300 --> 31:40.900
- What?
- Strap yourselves in!

32:06.800 --> 32:08.900
I think we're clear.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.100
I've never been so
afraid in my life.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.800
Look out!

32:24.900 --> 32:26.100
Ok.
Cindy?

32:26.300 --> 32:27.200
Yeah.

32:27.300 --> 32:28.300
Mike?

32:28.600 --> 32:29.600
Yeah.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.200
I'm going for some light.

32:43.900 --> 32:45.800
How bad do you
think it is?

32:47.400 --> 32:48.600
It felt bad.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.900
Sure did.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.300
Betty, confirm what
I'm seeing here.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.300
<I>Freight driver, main and
secondary engines are down...</I>

32:55.600 --> 32:58.600
<I>...due to pressure constriction of
components in direction control...</I>

32:58.800 --> 32:59.800
Thanks, Betty.

32:59.800 --> 33:03.300
<I>...and internal coolant system
has also shut down.</I>

33:03.700 --> 33:05.400
<I>You're welcome,
freight driver.</I>

33:05.900 --> 33:07.400
No chance for a fix?

33:08.600 --> 33:09.900
Sure.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.500
After a five hour cool down.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.000
We'll roast in here before then.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.700
It's getting hot in here.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.500
Yeah, I figure we got about
two hours before we burn up.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.900
Escape pod is no good.

33:28.200 --> 33:32.300
Too far away from the
nearest colony to make it.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.300
Anyway, it only holds two.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.100
So what's that mean?
We're gonna die?

33:37.200 --> 33:39.200
There's always a chance that
our emergency locator beacons...

33:39.400 --> 33:41.300
...will draw somebody
before that happens.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.200
Somebody?
What do you mean somebody?

33:45.200 --> 33:46.900
John!?

33:47.400 --> 33:51.800
Sure...
There's always a chance, baby.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.800
Always a chance.

34:01.800 --> 34:05.000
We got a little juice left
in the parking rocket.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.100
If we can cut the load loose...

34:09.699 --> 34:12.699
...we should be able to put ourselves
in the shadow of one of them asteroids.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.300
Yeah, that'd give us enough time
to fix the main engines.

34:15.500 --> 34:16.300
Let's go.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.000
It's a one man job.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.000
Be careful.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.300
You were born on Earth,
weren't you, Cindy?

34:35.600 --> 34:37.800
Yeah, New York City.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.100
That's technically a part of Earth.

34:42.199 --> 34:46.500
Earth... I've always dreamed
about going to that place.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.600
That's great.

34:49.600 --> 34:53.300
You know... birds, trees...

34:54.199 --> 34:56.000
Those things living in the rivers...

34:56.199 --> 34:57.500
Yeah, fish.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.300
My mother used to take me
to see them a couple of times.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.500
Earth is an amazing place.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.900
It's so hot.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.300
Yeah.

35:14.400 --> 35:14.900
Do you mind?

35:15.100 --> 35:16.200
No.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.500
I'll do the same.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.900
I feel so much better.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.900
John, how you doing
out there buddy?

36:23.400 --> 36:26.600
There's some kind of
automatic seal deal here.

36:26.900 --> 36:29.400
I'm gonna have to
try cracking it off.

36:29.600 --> 36:33.400
Alright, you do that. Let me know
if I can help you out, okay?

37:01.500 --> 37:03.700
Mike, we gotta stop.

37:03.900 --> 37:05.300
Wait... wait.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.100
Stuff like this
happens all the time.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.200
We got to realize one thing...

37:10.100 --> 37:11.900
...I'm engaged.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.300
What?

37:13.600 --> 37:16.000
It started out as a joke.
John asked me to marry him...

37:16.200 --> 37:18.400
...and I said sure,
if you take me to Earth.

37:18.700 --> 37:19.900
That's total bullshit!

37:20.000 --> 37:22.300
A promise is a promise, okay?
John's a good man.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.400
I don't have to justify myself
to you or to anybody...

37:33.800 --> 37:35.500
We gotta stop.

37:35.700 --> 37:36.900
I'm sorry.

38:18.700 --> 38:21.100
This here is not gonna work.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.400
It's awfully warm in here.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.700
It's awfully hot in here, isn't it?

38:38.300 --> 38:43.800
So... let's take her clothes off,
be more comfortable, huh?!

38:44.100 --> 38:44.800
Right?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.100
Yeah.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.600
Would that have been your idea?

38:49.900 --> 38:51.500
Yeah it was my idea.
So what?

38:51.700 --> 38:54.800
Well I think it's a pretty cheesy way
to get a look at my fiance's tits.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.100
Knock it off, John.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.400
Look, that's not what's
going on here, John, at all!

38:58.600 --> 39:01.700
I got to hand it to you, Mike.
King of the smooth dogs.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
"Oh, it's hot in here..."
"Your husband's outside..."

39:05.200 --> 39:07.600
- We're not married, alright?
- You know what I think of a guy...

39:07.900 --> 39:09.200
who forces a girl to marry him
in exchange for giving her a lift?

39:09.400 --> 39:10.200
I'd like to know what you think...

39:10.300 --> 39:12.200
Hey, hey, stop it...

39:12.400 --> 39:13.600
Stop fighting over a girl!

39:13.700 --> 39:16.200
There's gonna be two scoops of
ashes in about two hours, alright?

39:16.400 --> 39:17.900
We're gonna die here, ok?

39:18.100 --> 39:20.900
Why don't we try for a little
dignity for a change?

39:31.500 --> 39:33.700
I can't unhook the load.

39:37.200 --> 39:43.500
There's some kind of an auto defense
mechanism on the containers.

39:47.100 --> 39:49.100
Whatever's in them,
it ain't no sex dolls.

39:49.300 --> 39:52.200
A plastic date doesn't need
that kind of protection.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.100
Yeah, tell me about it.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.500
So what are we gonna do now?

39:57.400 --> 39:59.400
Why don't we divert the coolants
from the refrigerator...

39:59.500 --> 40:00.500
...through the inside plumbing?

40:00.600 --> 40:01.500
That's a great idea.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.600
It would give us something
to do anyways.

40:03.700 --> 40:09.300
The Pachyderm 2000 rig...
It don't have a refrigerator.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.000
Why the hell not?

40:11.100 --> 40:13.100
Because it's an option.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.700
I don't buy options, you know?

40:15.900 --> 40:19.900
Like... it's either suede seats or...

40:20.300 --> 40:25.100
...half tinted four port, or...
silent suck toilets.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.200
I don't buy options.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.700
Great.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.600
But I did bring this.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.700
Suck a ZOX.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.400
Well, at least we got some notice.

40:48.700 --> 40:51.100
It gives us time to prepare
ourselves for the end.

40:53.300 --> 40:55.000
However you do that.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.800
<I>Attention, freight driver!</I>

41:44.000 --> 41:46.900
<I>We've been approached by
an oligarch class passenger liner.</I>

41:47.200 --> 41:49.800
Passenger liner.
We're being saved.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.400
There's likely gonna be some
conditions attached to that.

41:52.800 --> 41:57.200
<I>Liner identified as
former vessel A7-N843.</I>

41:57.500 --> 41:59.500
<I>Vanished 10-24-92.</I>

41:59.600 --> 42:02.500
It didn't vanish.
It was jacked.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.900
These are the jackers, man.

42:05.300 --> 42:06.700
If it's who I think it is...

42:06.700 --> 42:09.800
...boy are you lucky you're not
wearing those company pajamas.

42:27.800 --> 42:30.600
<I>Move out, come on.
Let's go.</I>

42:36.800 --> 42:37.600
Come on, hurry up.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.100
Get that hatch open!
Come on!

42:41.900 --> 42:44.300
John, how many guns you got?

42:45.800 --> 42:47.200
I'm not even sure
this one works.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.400
They'll be in here in a minute...

42:48.400 --> 42:50.100
If you're not gonna use it
give it to me. I'll use it!

42:50.400 --> 42:53.100
You're gonna make one of them
desperate last stands?

42:53.300 --> 42:55.400
Look, set aside what this scum
might have in mind for us...

42:55.700 --> 42:57.400
...what do you think they're
gonna do to her, huh?

42:57.600 --> 42:59.700
Mike, there's not
a lot we can do.

42:59.900 --> 43:04.600
We just hope that our cooperative attitudes
and our sunny disposition see us clear.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.500
What did you have in mind, Mike?

43:06.600 --> 43:07.900
We hold them off as long
as we can and then...

43:08.200 --> 43:08.900
What?

43:09.000 --> 43:10.300
I'll save two shots
for the both of us.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.800
Oh, great... yeah.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.300
Can you put that thing away
someplace safe, ok?

43:15.500 --> 43:17.400
We're not gonna let them take us!
Give me the gun!

43:17.600 --> 43:19.200
Mike, I gotta go to Earth, okay?

43:19.400 --> 43:22.700
So if I got to wait through
neck-deep crap, I'm still going!

43:29.800 --> 43:32.300
Everybody, come on, move!

43:32.900 --> 43:35.300
We don't work for the company,
remember that!

43:36.400 --> 43:37.800
We're friendly, friendly.

43:38.000 --> 43:38.900
Drop it!

43:39.100 --> 43:40.800
We don't work for the company.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.400
Over to the control panel!
Move it, now!

43:43.600 --> 43:45.100
We're going, we're going.

43:45.800 --> 43:49.800
You're all prisoners of the
Regalia, if anyone's curious.

43:50.100 --> 43:53.300
If you try to escape,
you will be killed!

43:53.500 --> 43:56.700
If you resist,
you will be killed!

43:57.000 --> 44:01.200
If you fail to obey orders,
you will be killed!

44:01.600 --> 44:03.500
Ah, what the hell...

44:03.600 --> 44:06.000
...we'll probably kill you anyway.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.400
Alright, get them out of here!

44:08.500 --> 44:13.200
Come on. Move it!
Get out!

44:15.800 --> 44:18.700
Move 'em out!

44:21.800 --> 44:22.800
Come on.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.100
- We don't work for the company

44:24.300 --> 44:25.800
Move it!

44:27.200 --> 44:27.600
Sorry.

44:27.800 --> 44:28.700
Come on.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.700
Stay with me!

44:40.900 --> 44:42.600
Look at that, huh!?

44:43.200 --> 44:45.300
Salvage specialist.

44:46.700 --> 44:49.400
Shut up.
What are you hauling?

44:49.600 --> 44:52.200
- We don't know.
<I>- You don't know?</I>

44:53.100 --> 44:55.900
I'm telling you that we
don't know. Never cared.

44:56.200 --> 44:59.500
It's a mistake to give up caring.

45:01.100 --> 45:03.900
That's too much.
Macanudo wouldn't like it.

45:04.100 --> 45:06.400
You leave the captain to me!

45:06.600 --> 45:08.000
My pleasure.

45:08.100 --> 45:09.400
Cutt, man...

45:09.700 --> 45:12.800
Manifest says what they're
carrying is sex dolls.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.300
Sex dolls?

45:16.000 --> 45:17.300
What do you think they're
really carrying?

45:17.500 --> 45:20.300
Gotta be something hot.
Drugs maybe.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.400
You like drugs or guns best, Lou?

45:22.600 --> 45:24.000
<I>I like drugs.</I>

45:24.300 --> 45:25.000
<I>I like guns better.</I>

45:25.100 --> 45:26.200
- Scummy.
- Yeah?

45:26.400 --> 45:28.700
- Hook 'em up.
- This way...

45:29.800 --> 45:31.400
Where's Captain's equipment?

45:31.900 --> 45:33.300
Over here.

46:03.100 --> 46:06.000
Manifest says they're
carrying sex dolls.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.900
Thank you for apprising me,
Mr. Cutt.

46:12.100 --> 46:14.700
Well I do know how you love
to be apprised, sir.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.900
You have been perspiring.

46:41.200 --> 46:44.200
It was about 170 in the cab.

46:49.600 --> 46:51.100
I compliment you, my dear.

46:51.300 --> 46:53.200
You have a strong, distinctive...

46:53.400 --> 46:56.700
...and not altogether
unpleasant body odour.

46:56.900 --> 46:59.100
It's gratifyingly approachable.

46:59.400 --> 47:02.600
Captain... we want to thank
you for saving us.

47:02.900 --> 47:05.500
We're real grateful
about it, Captain.
Thank you.

47:10.100 --> 47:14.100
I didn't save you, you company scumbag.
I jacked your load!

47:14.300 --> 47:16.200
Well, whatever, we appreciate it.

47:16.500 --> 47:20.100
I think it's important that you understand
we do not work for the company.

47:26.700 --> 47:28.600
I want to know what
your cargo is...

47:28.800 --> 47:31.100
...who's the shipper
and who's the consignee?

47:31.300 --> 47:33.400
We don't know none of that.

47:34.700 --> 47:36.600
You're gonna kick yourself later.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.600
If you have trouble
to inform yourself.

47:52.600 --> 47:56.100
I wouldn't have to slice off
your manly process.

47:56.300 --> 47:57.700
Is he talking about my dick?

47:58.000 --> 48:01.800
Captain, we're just
independent contract haulers.

48:02.200 --> 48:03.300
We're trying to make a living.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.800
We don't ask a lot of questions.

48:05.100 --> 48:06.500
What we do know...

48:06.600 --> 48:10.900
...is whatever's in those cars
is not something to mess with!

48:11.300 --> 48:13.300
Do I look like someone
to mess with?

48:13.500 --> 48:14.500
No, sir.

48:14.700 --> 48:17.200
Like I have the IQ of
an egg timer?

48:17.400 --> 48:18.400
No.

48:18.600 --> 48:21.500
Those are high security double-due
containers you're hauling.

48:21.700 --> 48:24.500
I say the pair of you
are company butt boys!

48:24.600 --> 48:26.000
Wrong!

48:26.100 --> 48:28.400
If you're gonna hack off
my dick, do it!

48:28.600 --> 48:31.900
And I'll change my name to Terry
or Lee or something neutral.

48:32.200 --> 48:34.700
That ain't gonna change
what I know!

48:36.600 --> 48:38.600
Your dick?

48:41.800 --> 48:44.300
Is this your dick?

48:44.900 --> 48:46.300
No.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.400
That one's mine.

48:51.300 --> 48:55.700
Ok. I'm gonna run a proof of
Fermat's last theorem in my head.

48:55.900 --> 49:00.500
That takes between 8 and
17 seconds.

49:01.700 --> 49:03.700
And then we'll begin again.

49:06.300 --> 49:07.500
Captain's a genius.

49:07.600 --> 49:08.800
Yeah.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.200
I was head of company
research and development.

49:17.400 --> 49:18.800
Top man.

49:19.100 --> 49:21.700
Slotted for the big job.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.100
I was betrayed by
that bastard E.J. Saggs.

49:26.400 --> 49:29.000
Fool though he'd killed me.

49:29.300 --> 49:32.500
Made the mistake of having it
done in the laboratory.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.600
I was able to save myself.

49:37.100 --> 49:40.000
Recreate my body.

49:40.300 --> 49:43.200
You are a very attractive woman.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.000
In the normal course
of human affairs...

49:45.200 --> 49:47.400
...you probably wouldn't
look twice at me.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.800
Captain, where are
we going with this?

49:50.100 --> 49:52.700
I am drawn to beauty
like other men.

49:52.900 --> 49:58.900
The beauty... beauty gives me a wide
birth in life's halls, so to speak.

49:59.900 --> 50:04.200
Were you not chained to a major
support beam of my ship...

50:04.500 --> 50:08.000
...I wouldn't stand a chance of
having sex with someone so...

50:08.600 --> 50:10.500
...alluring as you.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.900
Leave her alone
you half-electric asshole.

50:13.100 --> 50:13.900
He didn't mean that!

50:13.900 --> 50:16.200
He respects the brave way
you confront your disability.

50:16.500 --> 50:17.700
Kill him.

50:18.200 --> 50:20.200
- Wait!
- Mr. Cutt...

50:21.300 --> 50:25.000
Look, I've got to get to Earth.
I've got to see my mother.

50:25.200 --> 50:29.000
So keep the load
and give us the rig, and...

50:30.300 --> 50:32.600
I'll have sex with you.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.100
Really?

50:37.300 --> 50:38.300
Yeah.

50:38.500 --> 50:41.400
Right there on the floor
if that's what you want.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.900
I think we should prepare
to my quarters, my dear.

50:49.500 --> 50:50.600
Scummy.

51:05.200 --> 51:06.300
John, we gotta do something!

51:06.400 --> 51:08.200
What are we gonna do?
Just sit here?

51:08.300 --> 51:10.300
Don't corrupt the right
to be indignant, kid.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.000
She's my fiance.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.300
What would make you
more comfortable, my dear?

51:45.800 --> 51:48.900
I have seven different
forms of sedation.

51:50.100 --> 51:51.900
Alcohol.

51:53.600 --> 51:55.900
The usual pharmacology.

51:57.100 --> 51:58.500
Let's not fool ourselves,
Captain, alright?

51:58.600 --> 52:00.900
I just want to get this over with.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.900
I can accept that.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.600
However, I'm confident that I can
make you a favorable impression.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.400
I rebuilt my own mind.

52:27.700 --> 52:29.700
So you got a homemade brain.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.200
I rebuilt everything.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.600
Every organ.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.200
I emmit a low-amp
electrical whang pulse...

53:41.500 --> 53:44.900
...designed to drive women
wild with pleasure.

53:45.400 --> 53:49.000
Stop, you're gonna make me puke.

53:50.200 --> 53:52.900
Quit talking or the
deal's off, okay?

54:01.500 --> 54:04.600
I pray you allow me a few
moments to coordinate my...

54:04.700 --> 54:07.900
...seldom used
reproductive sequencer.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.600
Yeah, sure.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.100
This casing's made out of
some exotic alloy...

54:26.300 --> 54:28.500
...and these security seals, man,
they're something new.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.500
I wouldn't mess with that load.

54:30.700 --> 54:33.000
It's bad.
It'll eat you alive

54:33.300 --> 54:36.400
My heart is racing,
Mr. Truckman.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.100
Ok, Sam...

54:39.500 --> 54:40.700
Hit it!

54:49.800 --> 54:51.100
- God...
- You alright?

54:53.800 --> 54:55.700
That's a diamond blade
that just shattered.

54:55.900 --> 54:57.400
What the hell does that?

54:57.600 --> 54:59.400
One of those things.

55:00.100 --> 55:01.200
We gotta try
something else, Lou

55:01.300 --> 55:02.300
Yeah.

55:04.700 --> 55:07.000
What the hell is that?

55:46.700 --> 55:48.200
Sam...

55:51.900 --> 55:55.200
Sam... are you alright?

55:55.600 --> 55:58.800
What's cooking?
Something's cooking.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.400
What are you talking about?

56:00.600 --> 56:03.600
Smells like somebody's
been making hamburgers.

56:03.900 --> 56:07.900
God damn, Sam!
It's you.

56:08.800 --> 56:11.000
It is?

56:14.000 --> 56:16.100
Sam...

56:16.800 --> 56:17.900
What did I tell you?

56:18.000 --> 56:19.400
Shut up!

56:22.500 --> 56:24.100
I gotta tell the captain.

56:25.300 --> 56:26.500
John, we gotta do something!

56:26.700 --> 56:28.900
What do you think they're
doing to her up there, huh?

56:29.200 --> 56:31.900
It's not the first time, kid,
and she's doing it for the team.

56:51.500 --> 56:54.800
We're a hundred percent
operational, my dear.

57:07.100 --> 57:10.000
Hey, you wanna lose the manlidge
or you're gonna give me a nosebleed.

57:10.200 --> 57:12.100
It's a good luck charm,
I never take it off.

57:12.300 --> 57:14.900
Just close your eyes
and think of Brooklyn.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.400
You treacherous bitch!

57:28.600 --> 57:30.100
Nothing personal.

57:35.500 --> 57:39.900
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life!

57:40.300 --> 57:43.100
Big talk for a guy who
can't get up off his back.

57:47.200 --> 57:48.900
You'll never get off this ship!

57:49.200 --> 57:51.100
Oh yeah?
Watch me!

57:53.400 --> 57:54.500
Mr. Cutt!

58:00.400 --> 58:02.000
There you are, Captain.

58:02.200 --> 58:05.000
Lou just went looking for you...
The load...

58:05.800 --> 58:07.600
You want me to leave... okay.

58:07.700 --> 58:09.700
Alright, Captain, ok.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.900
Back awfully quick,
aren't you, Captain?

58:19.700 --> 58:21.700
Did she ride you out?

58:23.600 --> 58:25.300
Kill 'em, huh?

58:26.700 --> 58:29.500
What? What?

58:30.400 --> 58:33.300
Oh, you want to kill them.
Absolutely, touchdown.

58:33.600 --> 58:35.300
You wanted to cut them down?

58:39.300 --> 58:42.600
You don't mind if I tenderize
them a little bit first?

58:44.100 --> 58:45.500
Scummy.

58:45.500 --> 58:49.000
You overblown cretin.

58:54.900 --> 58:57.800
Well, aren't you a regular
Mr. Fix-it?

59:03.900 --> 59:07.400
I'm sorry you couldn't find it
in your heart to give me a chance.

59:07.700 --> 59:10.200
You could've been
my beloved concubine....

59:10.400 --> 59:12.400
...and shared my position here.

59:12.700 --> 59:15.300
Well, I guess it wasn't
in my fortune cookie.

59:15.500 --> 59:18.300
Now all you'll
share is my crew...

59:18.800 --> 59:21.400
...312 of them in random order.

59:23.900 --> 59:29.100
But first, you can watch me
kill your friends.

59:29.400 --> 59:33.300
Or, if you prefer, you can scrunch up
your cute little nose and turn other way.

59:33.600 --> 59:34.500
Do it, Captain.

59:34.800 --> 59:37.700
Captain, did it occur to you that
a load with that kind of protection

59:37.800 --> 59:39.900
ought to be checked out first thing?

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.600
After you, Mr. Cutt.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.600
Yes, sir.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.600
Right behind you, Lou.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.000
Come on, get in there.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.000
Oh wow.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.500
Oh man!

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.800
Holly shit.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.600
What the hell is all this junk?

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.200
These...

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.500
...are my babies.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.900
Captain...

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:47.200
State of the art
disintegrators, boys.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.800
This baby will bake a man
in 500 milliseconds...

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.100
...and leave his watch and
small change lying on the deck.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.900
Just what have we got here, sir?

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.900
We've got Saggs, boys.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.100
We've got E.J. Saggs...

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.500
....right by his
shriveled little scrotum.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.600
A little reprogramming
and the company is mine.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.800
Ours, if you will.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:24.900
And then I'll feed Saggs'
liver to the ship's rats.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.100
Hey... look at this.
This one's missing.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.800
What?

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.500
Damn!

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.800
What's that do, Captain?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.400
Quiet!

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.900
It's coming!

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.200
Kill it!

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.100
What the hell is going on here?

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.500
I don't know but I bet
we'll get blamed.

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:08.900
Let's get out of here.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.400
Bite it deathnut, asshole.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.400
Get ready.
Let's go!

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.600
<I>Five minutes to
complete cool down.</I>

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.300
We ain't got five minutes!

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.900
Fire it up, will you, Mike?

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.000
We made it!

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.300
I can't believe we got
out of there.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.000
I gotta say I'm very very
happy to be here.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.400
God damn I am!

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.100
Me too.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.000
Of course you always feel that
way after a near miss.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.700
It wears off.

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:41.900
<I>Attention, freight driver...</I>

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
<I>...there is a breach in the
exterior hull of container 1.</I>

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.600
<I>Pressure and oxygen
loss is total.</I>

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:51.100
If we got a vacuumed container,
too bad, you know.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.300
If the load's perishable
it's already perished.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.400
Yeah, so forget it.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.100
Wait a second, does somebody
hear something back there...

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.900
...that sounds like there's
something back there?

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.500
I do.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.100
Bitchin' Betty, take over!

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.600
Mike, suit up.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.200
Cindy, move over here.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.400
Ok, sit here.
You watch these gauges.

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.600
You see a red light come on...

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.100
...you shout at me
on the radio, okay?

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.600
Alright.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.400
<I>I will need you to elaborate
on your instructions.</I>

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.300
Bitchin' Betty, you hold
the course toward Earth!

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.000
You better keep this, ok?

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.700
It's an SOS.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.800
Yeah, that can also be a trap.

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.600
Light me.

01:08:42.899 --> 01:08:44.800
There's a flame in my pocket.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.399
Maybe I should
get the first aid kit.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:01.600
Forget it.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.800
I cauterized the main arteries...

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.600
...but I don't have much time left.

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:08.600
What happened back
there at the Regalia?

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:10.000
Soldier...

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.100
...a warrior...

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.899
...activated and did what it's
programmed to do.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:18.899
And what about our cars here?
You know what's in them?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.100
An army.

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.000
What?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.899
I made them for the company.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.399
Genetically engineered...

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:30.000
...biomechanical super warriors.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.200
My babies.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.300
You can't stop them.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:36.899
There's gotta be some way
to shut those bastards off!

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.200
We're doomed...

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.700
...I'm afraid.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.200
If I had an anus...

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.300
...I'd probably soil myself.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.100
You gotta tell us
how to stop these things!

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.700
They activate in waves.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:00.200
1,2,4,8...

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.400
This thing here locks them up.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.900
You boys got a use for this?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.900
- He's gone.
- Yeah.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.600
For a son of a bitch
gamp rapist murderer...

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:37.600
...he died ok.
Come on.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.100
John...

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.300
John!
Do it!

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.600
Wow.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400
We should go check it out in there.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.400
We need some light in here.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.600
I've got a flashlight.

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.800
It ain't exactly made
for the space.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.600
It's made for reading
under the blanket, isn't it?

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.600
Damn!

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.500
This thing doesn't work
until they're all grown up.

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.700
Let's... get back outside
and wait for 'em.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Yeah.

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:52.200
Come on.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.900
Here.

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.000
John!

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.300
Is everything ok back there?

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.200
We don't know yet.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.300
I can't see anything.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.500
Isn't there supposed to
be four of them?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.300
Yeah.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.800
Where's the other two?

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.600
Cindy, put your space suit on!

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.400
They're headed toward the cab.

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.700
Do it, John!

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.300
Freeze 'em!

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.200
<I>Do not damage or destroy...</I>

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:48.300
<I>...your means of transport
to Earth!</I>

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.400
<I>Do not destroy your means...</I>

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.200
It's programming.
They can't wreck the truck.

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.400
John, he's got a Swiss army knife!

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.500
Oh shit, I made it mad!

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.800
<I>Cooking time
estimated 45 seconds.</I>

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.600
Next time there's gonna be eight.

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.100
We're in a qucik decaying
Earth orbit.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.200
So when I cut the load loose
it'll drop into the atmosphere...

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.700
...and incinerate those mutant guys.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.300
I want the two of you to get in
the escape pod and get out of here.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.200
No, we'll go with you!

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.700
You ain't being asked.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.600
Mike, you drive the pod.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.400
So what's the plan, John?

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.600
Well...

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.700
I'm gonna try to free
the coupling.

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:48.900
Blow it if I have to.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.100
And then I'm gonna
ride the rig down.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.600
Look, John, the goddamn rig will
never make it through the atmosphere.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.900
Get serious.

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:59.300
Kid, this is a Pachyderm 2000 rig!

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.000
It was mine before you were born...

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.500
...I know what it'll do.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.800
Now I got something I want to
say to both of you.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.800
Cindy, I'm releasing you of
all your obligations...

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:11.500
...to marry me right now.
Alright?

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.500
And I want to apologize
for the way I've done it.

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.500
It weren't right.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.300
And... you know, I guess
I've been jealous...

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:24.000
...since I saw the way you two
behaved with each other together.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.000
Look, John, you don't
have to apologize, really.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:30.400
Well, I don't do
it so well anyway.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.500
Probably 'cause you've
never done it before.

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.900
My advice to you is you take
this woman to the church...

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.300
...at the first exit off
the freeway and you get hitched!

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.300
You are a lucky man.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:46.400
Ok? Alright, partner.
Kick butt!

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.200
We're about ready here, John.
How is it going buddy?

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.300
Oh, it's hanging by a thread.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.200
I'll have it cut in no time.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.700
I can practically kick it apart.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.500
No sign of any genetic deal, so...

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.500
Go on, get out of here.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.600
John, I figure we'll try for
the Palmdale space port.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.200
You can bring your rig in there.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.800
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.400
I'll see you there.

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.600
Betty, how much time
before we hit the atmosphere?

01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.200
<I>32 seconds, freight driver.</I>

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.300
<I>Entering atmosphere.</I>

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.900
Had enough for you?

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.100
Wow, man.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.600
There he is.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:02.200
- Look, Mike, is that smoke?
- There's bound to be smoke!

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.500
The shielding will be burning off.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.100
Come on, John!
Come on, baby!

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.100
- Come on.
- He's getting closer.

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.700
He's gonna make it.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.300
He's gonna make it, Cindy.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.600
Here he comes.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.500
Oh my god.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.400
My god, Mike.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.900
Hey... hey...

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.000
Hey, look here.

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:46.700
You married yet?

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.100
Good to see you.

01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:58.300
<I>We interrupt this program
for a special news update.</I>

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.500
<I>Two space truckers and a waitress...</I>

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.900
<I>...have saved the Earth from
an invasion from outer space.</I>

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:07.300
<I>The three discovered they were
carrying an army of robotic warriors...</I>

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.600
<I>...sent by persons unknown
to conquer our planet.</I>

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.200
Mom...

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.400
I have Mike and John here with me.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.600
<I>Oh, just a second.</I>

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.000
Would you like us to come back when
you're a little more recovered, maybe?

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.500
<I>Nah, I'll be right with you.</I>

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.400
Sit down.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.800
Can we get you anything,
Mrs. Welch?

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.100
<I>Get this Mike... call me Carol.</I>

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:38.800
Mom?

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.200
Mom!

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.100
This is Mike.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:47.100
Oh, Mike, yeah,
welcome to the family.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.900
This is John.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.700
Oh yeah...

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.000
You are Carol Welch?

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.300
Cindy's your daughter?
This Cindy?

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.700
What? Do I look weird
or something?

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.300
You look great...

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.600
...and beautiful, like the
picture that I saw of you, but...

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:07.100
...that picture was taken
twenty years back.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.700
Could somebody tell me
what's going on here?

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.700
You see when I got sick,
they offered me a choice.

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:19.000
Die or get frozen.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.400
Anyway, I got the deep freeze...

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:23.900
...they thawed me,
they cured me...

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.200
...here I am.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.900
They froze you?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.700
Well, there's a lot of
fancy names for it but...

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.400
Yeah.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.500
I don't look freezer burnt, do I?

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.900
Not from what I can see.

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.800
Special agent Rigid,
I'm taking charge here!

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:42.800
What do you want?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:43.800
Pat 'em down.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:44.900
What?

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.200
I'm head of presidential security.

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:49.400
We're securing this room
for a presidential visit.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:03.800
The president?

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.300
The president of the world
is coming here?

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:07.800
Yeah?

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.500
- Mr. President, I...
- Ok, Rigid, move along.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.100
Shoo...

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.800
I'm president Saggs.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.000
And I'm here to express the
gratitude of my administration.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:31.200
And my constituents.
All the people of this system.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.000
Saggs?
E.J. Saggs?

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.300
I thought that the president's
name was Dobey.

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.000
Dobey is the former president.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.100
He resigned last week.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.600
Government's been privatized.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.700
High time.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.800
We know who you are Saggs, ok?

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:48.100
You sent those things to Earth...

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.100
...and you cost us a good rig...

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.200
...and you almost got us killed
about fifty times, okay?

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.800
Take it easy!

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.400
You're talking to
the president here.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.500
I'll grant you there've
been mistakes made...

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.200
...and there have been lies told.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.600
But I assure you,
whatever you've been told...

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.200
...I was not aware,
and I was not involved.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.000
You were not aware, right!

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:14.000
I mean, could it be that
some individual in the company...

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.600
...just overreached himself?

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:20.100
He sent these things to Earth
as a kind of insurance policy...

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.000
...in case the merger
talks broke down.

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.200
But I wouldn't like this sort of
rumors to be circulating...

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.600
...during the first crucial
days of my administration...

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:32.200
...or ever!

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:33.100
No problem.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:37.200
Now... just so happens there's
a new rig ready to take off...

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.000
...and it's waiting for you
there on gantry F.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.200
What did you think you could do?
Buy us like a tuna for sandwich?

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:47.100
I've also arranged to have your
mother's hospital bill taken care of.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.400
Now hold on a second...

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.400
And for your other troubles...

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:56.400
...maybe this will compensate
to some small degree.

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.100
We didn't do what we
did for money...

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:06.400
...and money doesn't fix
anything, alright?

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.900
You have our cooperation
and our silence, sir.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.600
Oh good.
Good!

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.600
Well, I must run.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.800
Remember now, hush-hush!

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:21.600
Yes, sir.

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:24.000
Thanks... for everything.

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:30.000
- Mr. Independent.
- What was that about?

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.000
- You're gonna keep this?
- No, we're not gonna keep it!

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.400
We don't want no part
of that money.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.500
You know, you guys could
really use that money.

01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:36.800
Getting married and all.

01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.100
Hey, we don't want
that kind of money!

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.200
You two don't get it, do you?

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:42.000
If you don't take this money...

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.500
...and shut up about what happened...

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.400
...they're gonna come after you,
and you'll disappear.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.500
Now you got to take it!

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.000
We got to take the money!

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.000
We got to take this...

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:56.100
...and become company butt boys
for the rest of our lives, yeah?

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.800
I want to make sure that
you understand the facts.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.800
You gonna take it, John?

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.100
- Are you gonna take it?
- No!

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.600
But I don't want you
to end up like me!

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.700
God forbid.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.000
Somebody fragged Saggs.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.800
You know, I think it was us!

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Oh, my god.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.400
We better get out of here.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.300
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.900
<I>Too bad Saggs blew himself up.</I>

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.400
<I>Never got to thank him for
the new rig.</I>

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.800
Alright, here we go.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.000
I've never done this before.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.300
Any chance I'll lose my lunch?

01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:57.800
You'll be fine.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.300
<I>5, 4, 3, 2, 1...</I>

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:04.700
<I>We have booster ignition!</I>
