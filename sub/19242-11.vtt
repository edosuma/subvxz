WEBVTT

00:57.390 --> 01:00.894
Kim Yong-jin embezzled money
from his company.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.605
He was destined to kill the chairman

01:03.688 --> 01:05.899
of the board of Happiness
who found out.

01:07.650 --> 01:11.488
I tried to get him to
leave Myreits, but I failed.

01:12.822 --> 01:16.367
The circumstances were different,
but he became a murderer in the end.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.584
However, I cannot tell
So-joon this fact.

01:26.044 --> 01:26.920
Because...

01:27.837 --> 01:31.007
my Ma-rin and So-joon

01:31.716 --> 01:34.636
will both be in danger
if they know.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.397
An accident?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.858
Can you determine that
this quickly?

01:49.567 --> 01:51.694
It has only been ten days.

01:51.778 --> 01:55.448
Seriously, come on!
You're not even a family member.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.366
Please leave.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.284
Calm down, So-joon
We can discuss this.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.786
Did you check the CCTVs?

02:00.578 --> 02:04.624
What about Shin Sung-kyu's calls?
Did you truly investigate thoroughly?

02:04.791 --> 02:07.252
Are you really 100 percent sure
it was an accident?

02:07.710 --> 02:10.046
Try to help me understand.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.714
Gosh, what a ruckus.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.300
Take care of it, Detective Kim.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.345
The accident occurred
in an area under re-development

02:17.428 --> 02:18.805
so there are no CCTVs.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.850
There is nothing unusual
in his call records.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.726
What about the black boxes
from cars?

02:23.810 --> 02:25.478
And the opinion of the doctor...

02:26.688 --> 02:28.189
the injuries are natural.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.817
You've already confirmed all of this.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.445
Is there no chance that someone
disguised it to look like an accident?

02:35.655 --> 02:38.533
If it was murder, he would've
been choked or stabbed.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.952
Whether it's the head or body,
he'd have an injury.

02:41.077 --> 02:42.704
There should be
some trace of that.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.248
Shin Sung-kyu doesn't have
those kinds of injuries.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.376
There are no signs of a murder.

02:48.459 --> 02:52.005
On the day of the accident,
he had no reason to go to that site.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.382
He was supposed to fly to Japan.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.303
He told his daughter
he'd be at the airport.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.972
That's why
we investigated this thoroughly.

03:01.055 --> 03:03.766
It makes no sense for him
to go to the construction site.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.269
I really don't
understand that either.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.648
Then are you saying
someone dragged him there?

03:11.608 --> 03:13.902
We tracked the location
of his phone.

03:14.027 --> 03:18.114
On that day, he first went
to the housing site in Sangjin-dong.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.534
Then he went to the accident site
in Hwakyung-dong.

03:24.495 --> 03:27.498
He went to the community housing site too?

03:27.665 --> 03:30.835
We have statements saying
he often inspected construction sites.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.213
So, we've concluded
that it was an accident

03:33.296 --> 03:35.298
while he was visiting a site.

03:39.135 --> 03:41.721
If he was at the community housing
construction site,

03:42.472 --> 03:44.599
you and Ma-rin
should have seen him.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.020
I didn't see anything.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.234
Then did he just pass by
where you andMa-rin were?

03:54.901 --> 03:57.153
And then he went
to the actual accident site?

03:58.279 --> 04:00.281
I didn't see anything suspicious.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.702
Like the police said...

04:05.036 --> 04:08.748
he could have gone there
just to inspect the construction.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.167
Hey, does that make sense to you?

04:12.043 --> 04:14.712
He didn't like that Se-young
was going to Japan.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.548
He might have just said
he was going, but changed his mind.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.846
All right, fine.
Honestly, I don't get it either.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.432
But, it makes less sense
that he got murdered.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.726
Who would do that
to someone like him?

04:29.269 --> 04:33.022
Hey, we knew about the accident
and tried to stop it.

04:33.564 --> 04:37.151
But, the accident location changed
and the same thing happened.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.696
It was as if someone set out
to make it happen.

04:41.447 --> 04:45.910
As if someone set out to make it happen
the same day and time coincidentally?

04:46.786 --> 04:49.539
It's hard for me to believe
and this is hard for me too.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.915
But we're not the police.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.626
You're being too emotional
because you feel guilty.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.129
What are you doing here?

05:00.591 --> 05:01.968
I called Ma-rin.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.470
I'm glad you're here.
Take him home.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.267
Your hair is all messed up.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.145
I'm sorry,
but I have to go somewhere.

05:12.812 --> 05:13.646
Where?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.982
I'm really unhappy with you today.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.234
Where are you going?

05:18.401 --> 05:19.819
I need to find out something.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.154
One year from now?

05:23.197 --> 05:24.407
Or two years from now?

05:24.907 --> 05:26.784
Like Ki-doong said
you're not a detective.

05:28.369 --> 05:33.041
Realize that I came here
to get you and come home with me.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.335
I'm sorry. Get home safely.

05:41.549 --> 05:45.970
Se-young's father passed by
the place we were watching?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.014
Yes.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.477
Ma-rin, you didn't happen
to see a strange car, did you?

05:57.148 --> 05:58.191
I'm not sure.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.111
There was a car that drove by.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.864
I'm not sure that anything was strange.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.033
Oh, it's nothing.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.994
I don't know why I'm being this way.

06:11.829 --> 06:17.126
I understand why So-joon
is insisting there's a culprit.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.838
And not believing in something
ambiguous like fate.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.383
He must want
to blame someone for it.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.844
Yes, I know.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.473
I honestly don't know
what is going on.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.434
I feel that way too.

06:38.856 --> 06:42.360
Ma-rin, you didn't happen to see
a strange car, did you?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.916
It was just a car passing by.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.883
I know you don't want to accept it,
but it really was an accident.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.178
By the way, you...

07:10.096 --> 07:12.890
shouldn't you apologize
for treating me like a criminal?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.560
You punk, you put handcuffs on me.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.186
Mister, look at me.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.648
Mister, you definitely know something.

07:20.898 --> 07:24.569
Your actions wouldn't make sense
if you didn't.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.865
What is it that you're hiding?

07:30.032 --> 07:31.117
So-joon.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.661
I'm sure that you know...

07:34.704 --> 07:36.497
that your future is not very good.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.833
Soon, I'll be gone without a trace.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.753
Then I'll die two years later.

07:44.005 --> 07:47.550
It could be worse than what you know.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.055
All I can do is repeat myself
over and over.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.434
If you try to stop
what's going to happen,

07:56.559 --> 07:58.603
things will get worse for you.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.731
That's why I don't want you
to know the future.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.276
Then why do you travel
to the other world?

08:06.068 --> 08:08.154
You should live
without knowing the future too!

08:11.616 --> 08:12.575
As for that...

08:14.076 --> 08:17.455
you will find out everything
when the time comes.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.792
Do you feel like a god

08:21.876 --> 08:23.794
just because you know
the future?

08:25.463 --> 08:27.256
I can't bear to listen to you.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.344
This is why I'm suspicious of you, Mister.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.180
What about you? You're even worse.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.598
Are you a god?

08:35.973 --> 08:39.519
Do you think that you can solve
every problem?

08:41.437 --> 08:42.730
You're going so overboard.

08:44.982 --> 08:45.983
Then what?

08:47.443 --> 08:52.573
What can I do besides
buy ramen from the other world?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.369
I know exactly
what's going to happen.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.539
Are you saying
I can't do anything?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.668
I should let it happen
even though I know?

09:05.127 --> 09:06.504
Geez.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.383
How screwed up is that?

09:15.972 --> 09:20.685
Pull yourself together
and walk straight. You, young punk.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.272
Why are you going to the future
and peeking in on my life?

09:24.355 --> 09:25.356
All right.

09:26.857 --> 09:31.612
Don't act like you know more
about my life than me, okay?

09:32.196 --> 09:34.407
It makes me feel like crap..

09:34.490 --> 09:37.577
Why you little punk!
How dare you shove your elder.

09:37.660 --> 09:41.455
You punk!
Do you even know who I am?

09:42.748 --> 09:44.500
Hey, kid! I'm...

09:45.167 --> 09:50.006
Stop pretending to know about my life!

09:52.800 --> 09:56.387
How could there be such a thing
I could do nothing about?

09:57.680 --> 10:00.683
I'll ride the subway until the very end.

10:00.766 --> 10:01.642
Why, you ask?

10:02.768 --> 10:05.271
I have to save my Ma-rin.

10:09.025 --> 10:13.279
You want me to let it happen
even when I knew, like this time?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.950
She's the only family I have in the world!

10:18.909 --> 10:22.246
She's my one and only wife,
my woman.

10:30.087 --> 10:34.425
I... I'm supposed to protect her
to the very end.

10:35.676 --> 10:36.719
If I don't...

10:39.305 --> 10:41.307
I'll be so sorry.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.355
So-joon.

10:54.695 --> 10:55.655
Mister.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.365
So-joon.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.494
So-joon. What are you going to do?

11:03.788 --> 11:04.955
I'm sorry.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.460
Why do you have to eat that here?

11:10.544 --> 11:12.171
I told you to eat it too.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.715
Are you trying to torture me?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.134
Oh, I'm dying of hunger.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.428
Who told you to starve?

11:19.595 --> 11:20.763
Eat it.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.973
What's there to life?
You have to eat.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.101
I don't even know if So-joon's eating.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.394
How can I eat?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.270
So, you're going to starve with him?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.189
I'm going to starve with him!

11:30.272 --> 11:31.607
It's called sharing the pain.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.943
Gosh, I ought to call the mayor
and ask him for

11:34.026 --> 11:36.028
a faithful wife award.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.197
My goodness. "Hello, Mayor."

11:38.614 --> 11:40.157
Ma-rin.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.784
Oh, Realtor.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.162
-Why is he so late?
-She only cares for her husband.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.792
-Ma-rin.
-Oh, you reek of alcohol.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.837
My pretty Song Ma-rin.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.214
He's totally drunk.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.091
Why did you drink so much?

11:57.174 --> 11:58.384
My mom is here.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.511
Son, Mom is right here.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.680
My pretty wife.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.600
My poor Song Ma-rin.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.687
I'm here. I'm right here.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.440
Why are you so drunk?
Let's go inside.

12:14.442 --> 12:18.070
I'm going to pretend
I didn't see that.

12:18.654 --> 12:19.947
Ma-rin.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.199
Let's go inside. You're so drunk.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.162
-Mother.
-Yeah, I'm here.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.289
-Mother!
-Oh my.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.959
-Mother!
-Gosh.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.670
-I love you.
-No! You can't!

12:34.879 --> 12:36.797
Mom, go. You should go.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.299
-Mother.
-Take him in.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.176
I love you, Mother.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.302
Yes, I love you too.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.013
Okay, I love you.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.390
Ma-rin.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.060
How will you face my mother again?

12:50.144 --> 12:52.563
Oh, Ma-rin.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.111
I was worried
you wouldn't be eating.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.197
I guess you're eating just fine.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.449
Is your stomach okay?

13:04.033 --> 13:05.409
No..

13:06.243 --> 13:07.495
It hurts.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.373
Get up.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.625
Get undressed.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.296
Go to sleep now.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.591
Sleeping will make you feel better.

13:26.263 --> 13:29.099
-Ma-rin.
-Yes?

13:30.392 --> 13:34.146
I'm going to forget it all.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.150
Se-young's dad passing away.

13:39.819 --> 13:44.281
I'm going to be ungrateful
and have no conscience.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.367
I'm going to forget it all.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.329
I want the two of us
to live happily.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.457
I'm only going to worry
about our future.

13:54.792 --> 13:59.630
I'm going to protect you,
no matter what.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.718
Okay.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.055
You won't be able
to forget it all at once.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.142
Still, it's better
to make that decision.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.229
Just trust me.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.942
I can make you happy, at least.

14:22.778 --> 14:23.654
I trust you.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.537
His stomach won't feel good tomorrow.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.004
Hey.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.633
What is all of this?

14:44.800 --> 14:48.929
Wow! Why did you bring so much?

14:51.098 --> 14:52.266
You even brought a book.

14:52.349 --> 14:56.228
That's a book
I read in one sitting.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.522
It was so good,
I didn't realize the time.

15:00.691 --> 15:03.903
This is pretty heavy.
Should I carry it in for you?

15:05.029 --> 15:06.614
It won't even take five seconds.

15:06.780 --> 15:07.907
Am I a sick patient?

15:12.286 --> 15:13.537
Anyway, thank you.

15:14.371 --> 15:18.334
Tell So-joon and Ma-rin
thanks for helping out so much.

15:18.959 --> 15:22.755
What? You don't need to thank me.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.506
I am your fool.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.842
You were fired long ago.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.262
Gosh.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.140
I better find a new fool position.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.769
I have experience from your point of view.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.484
Kang Ki-doong is a fool
for Shin Se-young.

15:44.276 --> 15:47.279
So, you can ask me
for whatever you need, okay?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.117
I'll get going now.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.745
I can eat for one month with this.
Thank you.

15:55.079 --> 15:55.955
Se-young.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.504
You're going
to Japan again, right?

16:06.298 --> 16:08.300
I don't know what I should do.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.344
My mom is alone now.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.721
Then can't you just stay here?

16:16.850 --> 16:18.936
Ah, what am I saying?

16:19.353 --> 16:23.273
Don't worry about anything.
Go and get some rest, okay?

16:23.732 --> 16:24.608
Go on in.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.569
Oh no. Go inside.

16:29.029 --> 16:29.863
It's okay.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.866
Hey, let's just leave now.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.911
My whole body hurts.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.747
This place is only full of young kids.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.416
It's so embarrassing being here.

16:40.541 --> 16:41.834
What are you talking about?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.628
No one can leave
until you all get arthritis.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.632
Hey, look over there.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.467
Do you see that man?

16:50.634 --> 16:51.593
Who?

16:52.136 --> 16:53.262
Right over there.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.930
The one dancing like a crazy man?

16:55.014 --> 16:55.973
Yeah.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.268
I'm going to be the queen
of illicit relations today.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.229
What?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.907
What is wrong with people?

17:55.991 --> 17:57.117
Over here.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.246
Seeing me at the club is a secret
you must take with you to the grave.

18:01.330 --> 18:05.626
Yes, it'll be between us
until I have dirt on my eyes.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.378
Though it feels odd.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.464
It's not like anything happened.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.925
-Have a drink.
-Yes.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.676
I'm already sober..

18:15.302 --> 18:16.887
Yes, thank you

18:20.015 --> 18:22.142
Why are you sitting on the corner
so awkwardly?

18:25.312 --> 18:28.232
I will move over.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.820
By the way...

18:33.737 --> 18:38.158
is there something bad going on
for Yong-jin at work lately?

18:39.118 --> 18:42.371
He hasn't been sleeping well,
as if he's on the run.

18:42.913 --> 18:47.000
He laughs alone and yells alone.
He seems like a different person.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.921
I feel like I'm going insane
He even mentioned Vietnam.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.673
He said you look Vietnamese?

18:52.881 --> 18:55.717
-You don't look Vietnamese.
-What are you talking about?

18:56.135 --> 18:59.054
No, anyway...

18:59.304 --> 19:01.682
Tell me if there's
anything you know

19:02.099 --> 19:03.350
Is he getting fired?

19:04.935 --> 19:08.021
Honestly, I don't really know.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.150
He is so on edge lately
that I'm having a very hard time.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.986
I went clubbing today
because I'm so stressed out.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.445
Me too.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.615
It was my first time since I got married,
because I'm stressed.

19:19.783 --> 19:20.868
I understand.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.745
You are suffering a lot at work,
Secretary Hwang.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.582
You are suffering
a lot at home, Madam.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.648
Good. Totally charismatic.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.276
Done. Okay.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.702
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.537
I'm taking you to work.

20:06.622 --> 20:10.375
If I let you wallow,
I think you'll become a loser.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.378
I'm going to be strict.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.714
I will care for you
like Han Seok-bong's mother.

20:15.797 --> 20:16.757
What?

20:17.174 --> 20:19.051
I'll get you to work.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.677
What are you talking about?

20:20.761 --> 20:22.596
My stomach hurts so much.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.849
-Is there anything for my hangover?
-Where are you going?

20:31.605 --> 20:32.481
What is this?

20:32.731 --> 20:35.108
Red ginseng. It's good for you.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.735
Eat this.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.240
-Is this for hangovers?
-Yes.

20:43.283 --> 20:46.536
Do you remember
what you said to me yesterday?

20:47.496 --> 20:48.664
What did I say?

20:50.874 --> 20:54.086
How upsetting.
I feel so empty this morning.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.047
What did I do?
I don't have bad drinking habits.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.633
They say drunk people
don't recognize their own parents.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.051
You were just like that.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.346
It's true that I don't really remember.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.808
You don't have the right to say
anything about drinking to me.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.017
Just eat it.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.603
You're frail,
that's why you get drunk so easily.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.854
That hurts.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.941
Seriously, what did I say?

21:16.066 --> 21:18.986
I'm not even a person
if I miss work.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.988
I will be a diligent person.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.740
I will do everything
Song Ma-rin says.

21:23.824 --> 21:24.866
That kind of thing.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.910
I just feel so sick.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.829
-Make me some ramen.
-Ramen, yeah right.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.914
Hurry up. You're late.

21:35.585 --> 21:36.753
Oh my.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.465
I said I would drive.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.551
Why do you need
to drive me to work?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.095
Am I a child?

21:45.470 --> 21:46.471
Why?

21:46.763 --> 21:47.597
Are you nervous?

21:47.681 --> 21:48.932
Yes.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.227
Oh, yes. That's what I was after.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.521
I'm trying to make you alert.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.482
But I'm not alert.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.485
I feel completely out of it.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.738
Me too.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.157
Take a left turn.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.491
Okay. Left turn.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.576
Oh no.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.411
What are you doing?

22:09.661 --> 22:12.289
-Where are the signals?
-It's on your left.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.501
You can't change lanes now.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.253
You passed the left turn.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.966
We'll have to go around a bit.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.219
How come there are no right turns?

22:26.595 --> 22:28.430
I'm really good at right turns.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.016
Hey, right here. It's a right turn.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.642
Okay, right turn.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.062
-Ah!
-They're on again.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.063
What are you doing?

22:39.608 --> 22:43.403
Lately, I've been hearing a lot
of talk about Director Kim Yong-jin.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.822
Ah, you mean about Jangho city?

22:45.906 --> 22:47.866
Oh, you heard too?

22:47.991 --> 22:50.452
Everyone's talking about it, right?

22:50.577 --> 22:52.579
Director Wang,
you started the rumors.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.207
What in the world? I did?

22:55.374 --> 22:59.753
I heard that you started
all these rumors about it.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.256
You punk!
You must think I'm your friend.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.967
What's the matter?
You said it last time.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.053
Okay,.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.971
Okay.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.140
I apologize, Director.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.031
Oh, that was so hard.

23:30.158 --> 23:31.493
We're at your office, right?

23:31.576 --> 23:33.245
Is this Busan or something.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.288
Why did it take four hours?

23:36.998 --> 23:39.000
It's better
to be late than absent.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.503
That's what my mother used to say.

23:42.170 --> 23:45.674
When I was too sick to go to school,
she'd say to die at school if I must.

23:46.591 --> 23:49.177
-That's why I'm here at work.
-Yes.

23:51.012 --> 23:51.930
So-joon.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.308
Have a good day.

23:55.725 --> 23:56.768
Thanks.

23:59.604 --> 24:00.897
I feel like vomiting.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.280
-Song Ma-rin.
-Yeah?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.532
I'm okay now.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.659
You don't need to go overboard.

24:13.034 --> 24:15.620
You don't look so good.
You look a little ill.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.831
That's from being in a car
for four hours.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.792
Should I walk you to your office?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.753
I even did a career woman style,
just in case.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.465
You should go.
I'm going to head in.

24:26.965 --> 24:27.966
Yu So-joon.

24:29.176 --> 24:30.760
Don't go "pop"
and disappear again.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.763
Don't go to the other world.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.141
Pop is banned from now on.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.978
You better not go.
You're dead if you do.

24:40.061 --> 24:40.979
Drive safe.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.439
Don't you dare go!

24:43.356 --> 24:44.524
Drive carefully.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.572
Hey.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.657
Should I call a driver? What's wrong?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.451
Oh! Hey!

24:58.163 --> 24:59.247
Get home safely.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.501
Director Wang.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.461
Have you had lunch?

25:05.086 --> 25:08.882
No, I'm holding off
to get something good later.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.675
Why? You want to eat together?

25:11.092 --> 25:14.137
I thought we could talk over lunch.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.724
About the Sammi project you're working on,
it's still on hold, right?

25:17.807 --> 25:20.060
Yes, thanks to you.

25:21.353 --> 25:25.065
You want to push it forward, right?
Should I help you do it?

25:26.024 --> 25:28.818
Last time, you said,
"Are you crazy? Are you insane?"

25:28.902 --> 25:31.363
You threw a fit?
Why the sudden change of heart?

25:31.613 --> 25:34.866
You're known in this industry
for a reason, Director Wang

25:34.991 --> 25:36.451
I trust you, of course

25:36.660 --> 25:39.246
What are you up to now?

25:39.871 --> 25:43.542
I'm not up to anything.
I just want to trust you and work.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.543
Seriously.

25:44.626 --> 25:48.046
Sure, I'd be very thankful
if you agreed to help me, Yong-jin.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.799
I know how talented you are.
I just never say it.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.301
-Hello.
-Oh, Chairman.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.095
-You're here.
-Yes.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.431
I heard someone
you knew passed away.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.850
You don't look so well.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.602
I was in a car for a long time.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.524
I heard about it
and considered going to the funeral.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.234
Kang assured me
it was unnecessary.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.070
My employees didn't need to attend.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.156
You must be heartbroken.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.410
I don't know how
to express how bad I feel.

26:18.952 --> 26:19.869
Thank you for that.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.247
-Thank you.
-Yes.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.000
Chairman, stay strong.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.424
His face doesn't look good.

26:32.507 --> 26:35.427
Manager Kang looks so down
these past few days too.

26:36.303 --> 26:39.347
I heard it's not a family member.
Who was it, then?

26:39.431 --> 26:42.517
There's an NGO called Happiness.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.603
He's the chairman of the board there.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.397
Really? Where did you hear that?

26:50.483 --> 26:54.904
I don't know.
I know heard it somewhere.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.245
How embarrassing.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.041
I was trying to be
a dutiful wife for once.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.931
I'm driving, say what you need
before the green light or call back.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.267
Let's meet now. I need to talk to you.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.853
Why bring up driving
as soon as you pick up?

27:27.687 --> 27:30.899
My entire life is at a red light.

27:31.941 --> 27:35.362
I'll text you the location,
so come right now.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.663
"How to survive in Vietnam."

27:54.839 --> 27:56.841
Why is everything so hard, seriously?

28:03.056 --> 28:04.057
What are you saying?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.810
It's Vietnamese.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.770
I'm learning Vietnamese.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.105
Guess why.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.857
Are you going on a vacation?

28:13.149 --> 28:15.068
Did you call me
to show off your vacation?

28:15.443 --> 28:16.903
Vacation, yeah right.

28:19.906 --> 28:24.035
First, promise me that you'll keep it
a secret from your husband.

28:25.286 --> 28:28.832
I'm telling you this
because I trust you as my friend.

28:30.291 --> 28:31.126
What is it?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.503
You're saying this now and then...

28:33.878 --> 28:37.841
Honey, actually Gun-sook said...

28:38.633 --> 28:41.803
-You're going to do that, right?
-Don't tell me if you don't trust me.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.473
I have so many secrets
that my head is going to burst.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.852
I'm not even curious about your secret.

28:49.310 --> 28:52.605
I'm going to emigrate to Vietnam.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.942
-Emigrate?
-Yes.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.654
I don't even like
pho noodles that much.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.698
Seriously, I...

29:02.240 --> 29:03.283
Why, so suddenly?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.326
I don't even know why.

29:05.785 --> 29:08.496
Yong-jin insists even though
I said I don't want to.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.125
Song Ma-rin.

29:13.626 --> 29:17.464
I'm throwing away all my pride
and asking you for one favor, okay?

29:20.800 --> 29:24.471
Ask your husband
to look upon my Yong-jin favorably.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.473
Talk to him about it, okay?

29:29.434 --> 29:31.436
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

29:31.728 --> 29:33.563
It's weird to see you like this.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.732
Hey. Are you going to do it or not?

29:36.191 --> 29:38.735
Why? Are things bad at work?

29:38.902 --> 29:41.362
I have no idea

29:41.738 --> 29:45.074
If things are going well in Korea,
why would he want to leave?

29:46.367 --> 29:50.872
You know that my husband and yours
don't really get along, don't you?

29:51.956 --> 29:53.792
The chairman doesn't like him,

29:53.917 --> 29:56.252
so how could work be easy for Yong-jin?

29:57.212 --> 29:58.213
That's not true

29:59.255 --> 30:02.008
He told me that
Director Kim works the hardest

30:02.133 --> 30:03.343
and other positive things.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.512
-Really?
-Yeah.

30:07.388 --> 30:10.350
Well, you have your life too.

30:10.892 --> 30:14.062
Yong-jin making the decision
to emigrate on his own is too much.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.606
Be honest and talk to him.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.399
Yeah.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.653
You should talk to your husband
for me too.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.989
It was really hard for me
to bring this up to you.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.243
Oh, don't bring up Vietnam though .

30:29.077 --> 30:32.205
I wasn't supposed to tell anyone
that he might quit work.

30:33.623 --> 30:34.666
All right.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.043
How bad must it be
that you're coming to me?

30:39.337 --> 30:42.674
Yong-jin is very good to me.

30:43.007 --> 30:46.803
It's not because
there are problems in our relationship.

30:47.595 --> 30:50.181
Yes, I know.
He thinks of you a lot.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.186
But, Vietnam would be a bit lonely.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.815
-That's what I'm saying.
-Okay.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.115
Where are you off to?

31:07.365 --> 31:08.992
Why are you in watch mode too?

31:09.117 --> 31:13.788
My gal pal asked me to watch
over you to make sure you work.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.081
Who is your gal pal?

31:15.164 --> 31:16.124
Ma-rin.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.585
Stop it, seriously.

31:18.751 --> 31:19.878
She said to me...

31:19.961 --> 31:22.755
Please take care of my So-joon.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.925
Along with ten worry-face emoticons.

31:26.467 --> 31:28.177
You even send emoticons
to each other?

31:28.261 --> 31:29.679
Yes, so what?

31:29.888 --> 31:30.972
I don't like it.

31:31.389 --> 31:32.599
You people have no limits.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.142
Where are you going?

31:38.855 --> 31:41.232
I can't leave things messy like this.

31:41.524 --> 31:42.609
It's Se-young's dad.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.905
I'll go one last time and check on things.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.365
Then, I can organize my feelings.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.201
How are you going to check?

31:52.827 --> 31:54.829
I looked into everything I can.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.832
Wouldn't the police station
be the best way?

31:59.792 --> 32:02.837
TWO YEARS LATER: FUTURE

32:04.839 --> 32:05.673
Excuse me.

32:06.507 --> 32:07.383
Hello.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.136
Me?

32:10.386 --> 32:12.722
Yes. Do you remember me?

32:13.222 --> 32:16.017
I met<i> </i>you during Happiness'
Shin Sung-kyu's

32:16.100 --> 32:17.185
accident two years ago.

32:17.268 --> 32:18.311
Ah, back then.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.608
-Are you here to meet me?
-Yes.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.320
I'm a little busy now, though.

32:27.528 --> 32:30.114
Wait. I just need to ask you a few things.

32:31.699 --> 32:34.619
After Shin Sung-kyu's accident, were

32:34.869 --> 32:39.457
there any leads or circumstances
that seemed suspicious to you?

32:39.749 --> 32:40.792
By the way...

32:42.001 --> 32:44.671
aren't you the chairman of Myreits?

32:45.046 --> 32:45.964
Yes, I am.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.466
Oh! Weren't you reported missing?

32:50.969 --> 32:54.180
The chairman of Myreits was
reported missing around that time.

32:54.764 --> 32:55.598
Wasn't he?

32:55.765 --> 32:57.767
Yes, you were.
Detective Jo took the case.

32:58.059 --> 33:01.229
Ah, there must be an error.

33:01.771 --> 33:04.148
You should get back to work.

33:08.611 --> 33:10.613
You know the chairman of Myreits?

33:11.030 --> 33:13.157
The real estate company
and Bap-soon's husband.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.702
-Yeah, the missing person?
-Right?

33:15.952 --> 33:17.745
He went missing
two years ago in winter,

33:17.829 --> 33:19.580
and it was kept from the media.

33:19.706 --> 33:20.790
What about it?

33:21.207 --> 33:23.835
How was that resolved?

33:24.460 --> 33:26.629
What are you talking about?
He's still missing.

33:26.713 --> 33:27.547
What?

33:28.423 --> 33:29.507
I just met him.

33:29.590 --> 33:30.967
-You met him?
-Yeah.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.635
-Yu So-joon?
-Yeah.

33:34.721 --> 33:35.722
What was he wearing?

33:35.805 --> 33:38.766
Was he wearing summer clothes
or acting odd?

33:39.475 --> 33:41.477
-He seemed fine.
-Where did you see him?

33:42.103 --> 33:42.979
Out front.

33:51.821 --> 33:54.282
I didn't leave on my own.

33:54.824 --> 33:55.992
I went missing?

34:00.079 --> 34:01.289
The air is so nice.

34:01.664 --> 34:02.915
-Ki-doong.
-Yes?

34:02.999 --> 34:04.417
I'm so lonely.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.210
You should live well.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.172
Should us, lonely people
have a drink together?

34:11.174 --> 34:12.425
Next time.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.177
Hey, you shouldn't be like that.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.387
Come on. Next time, for sure.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.805
Forget it!

34:17.930 --> 34:19.599
-See you tomorrow.
-No!

34:32.195 --> 34:33.071
You...

34:35.823 --> 34:37.116
You're from the past, right?

34:38.701 --> 34:40.078
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.168
Where are we going?

34:47.251 --> 34:49.253
-Let's go somewhere quiet.
-So-joon.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.926
I said let's go somewhere quiet.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.929
I don't know
why you're doing this.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.723
Let's not do this on the street.
Let's eat and talk.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.852
Whether you're from the past or not,
I'm really happy to see you.

35:05.645 --> 35:08.231
So, just have a meal with me.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.024
How did I go missing?

35:12.610 --> 35:14.946
You said my relationship
with Ma-rin wasn't good.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.281
So, we broke up and I went abroad?

35:19.283 --> 35:21.452
Tell me the truth,
because I already know.

35:23.412 --> 35:25.414
Why did I go missing?

35:29.460 --> 35:30.461
I don't know.

35:31.087 --> 35:34.048
You went to the future
and didn't come back.

35:36.509 --> 35:37.343
Why?

35:37.426 --> 35:41.180
I don't know what happened to you.
Is it that you can't come?

35:41.472 --> 35:42.515
How could I know?

35:49.063 --> 35:50.022
Then why?

35:50.982 --> 35:52.483
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

35:53.317 --> 35:55.611
Why did you tell me
that ridiculous lie?

35:57.697 --> 35:58.865
Why did you do it?

35:59.824 --> 36:02.243
Ma-rin asked me to tell you that.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.871
Ma-rin did?

36:05.121 --> 36:06.706
-So-joon.
-Why would she?

36:06.789 --> 36:09.208
She must want to go back
to before she married you.

36:10.793 --> 36:11.961
Don't lie to me.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.129
Hey.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.173
You disappeared one morning.

36:15.256 --> 36:19.260
No matter what she does,
she doesn't know if you're dead or alive.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.928
Stop lying.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.763
Ma-rin still can't forget you.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.309
She lives alone in your house
and waits for you.

36:26.726 --> 36:29.145
How painful must it be for her
to wait for you?

36:31.772 --> 36:32.607
No.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.735
I can't trust you anymore either.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.696
So, just stop talking.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.158
It shouldn't have happened.

36:47.496 --> 36:50.458
If you two had never met,
this wouldn't have happened

36:50.666 --> 36:52.543
That's why I had to lie to you.

36:57.506 --> 36:58.841
Just stop talking.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.718
Hey. Be honest.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.054
Did you ever go missing
in your original future?

37:03.137 --> 37:04.472
You didn't, right?

37:04.931 --> 37:06.641
I thought about this a lot.

37:06.766 --> 37:09.810
Why do you think you went missing?
You changed your future.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.271
You were never
supposed to marry Ma-rin.

37:12.647 --> 37:16.943
You suddenly married her
and your entire future changed.

37:17.276 --> 37:18.611
So, what?

37:18.819 --> 37:21.030
Are you trying to tell me
to live my life the way

37:21.489 --> 37:22.990
it's been destined?

37:23.783 --> 37:25.326
For your sake...

37:27.286 --> 37:29.288
Or for Ma-rin's sake...

37:30.706 --> 37:32.625
put things back
to their original place.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.843
I just met So-joon.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.848
From two years ago,
when Se-young's father passed away.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.601
He came from around that time.

37:51.018 --> 37:51.894
But...

37:54.522 --> 37:57.358
he already knew
that he would be going missing.

37:59.193 --> 38:02.822
Well, you didn't tell him
the truth, did you?

38:03.197 --> 38:04.031
No.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.993
He didn't seem to know anything
about Kim Yong-jin.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.787
I told him what you wanted me to.

38:12.498 --> 38:14.834
But, I think...

38:15.251 --> 38:18.170
we should tell him the truth
about Kim Yong-jin.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.213
No.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.010
Even if he knew everything,
he couldn't have stopped it.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.307
From the very beginning...

38:30.433 --> 38:32.810
he should not have met me
and that's the right thing.

38:36.814 --> 38:40.693
If he could go back now
and break up with me...

38:43.446 --> 38:45.448
If we had broken up back then...

38:47.325 --> 38:50.328
So-joon wouldn't have had
these bad things happen to him.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.707
It was all because of me
from the beginning.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.128
I don't really know if we're doing
the right thing.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.882
Will doing this
bring So-joon back to life?

39:05.259 --> 39:07.261
This is so hard for me.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.181
Se-young's here. I have to go.

39:14.894 --> 39:15.728
You're here?

39:15.811 --> 39:16.687
Wow.

39:17.021 --> 39:17.980
Why so serious?

39:18.439 --> 39:20.441
I was just on the phone.

39:24.987 --> 39:25.905
What is it?

39:26.989 --> 39:28.157
Tada!

39:32.745 --> 39:33.746
Open it.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.601
I did the right thing.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.813
If I want to save So-joon...

40:01.190 --> 40:02.691
I have to turn everything back.

40:04.443 --> 40:05.945
You're doing the right thing.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.594
Ma-rin still goes
to Namyeong Station

40:30.886 --> 40:33.055
every few days and waits all day.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.307
She's hoping you might come back.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.435
The time you have
before you go missing,

40:37.768 --> 40:41.272
the happiness you have now
won't last even one month.

40:42.982 --> 40:46.861
Just to be happy for a month.
Must she live a hard life forever?

40:49.655 --> 40:51.073
Go back and break it off.

41:26.066 --> 41:26.984
Hey! Get in.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.112
You weren't at home?

41:31.280 --> 41:33.532
I was practicing driving
where there were no cars.

41:34.241 --> 41:36.243
I think I have a feel for it now.

41:36.869 --> 41:39.205
I can change lanes very well now.

41:39.872 --> 41:41.874
Left and right turns...

41:42.458 --> 41:43.918
I succeed one in three times.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.421
I'm going to end up
being the best driver.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.548
How long will that take?

41:50.841 --> 41:52.301
Give me three months.

41:53.469 --> 41:54.386
Three months.

41:55.304 --> 41:56.597
Isn't that too long?

41:58.849 --> 42:03.229
If I put in a little effort,
I can drive you to work.

42:03.771 --> 42:04.688
When you're sick...

42:31.340 --> 42:34.009
I thought you trusted me,
so trust me.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.554
It's not a matter of trust.

42:37.471 --> 42:40.432
Turn on your signal and change lanes.

42:40.641 --> 42:41.976
No, there's a car there.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.103
It's okay to go in now.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.399
What if that man doesn't know
what I'm thinking?

42:48.482 --> 42:51.443
Trust me. You have to trust me.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.200
How can you shut your eyes?

42:58.325 --> 43:00.327
I don't want to learn
driving from you.

43:00.494 --> 43:01.537
You pressure me.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.706
Are you going to go straight forever?

43:04.164 --> 43:05.874
In the movie
"One Fine Spring Day,"

43:06.166 --> 43:08.127
Lee Young-ae sits on Yoo Ji-tae's lap.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.588
It was very romantic when he taught her.

43:10.671 --> 43:13.841
What's with this reality?
It's not romantic at all.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.718
Hey, that's illegal.

43:15.801 --> 43:18.429
You can't drive
with a person on your lap.

43:20.639 --> 43:24.643
Why did such a law abiding person
kiss me on the streets?

43:25.060 --> 43:26.312
It's bad for public morale.

43:27.396 --> 43:29.815
Student, turn on your signal.

43:30.149 --> 43:32.151
Let's change lanes.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.112
-Now?
-Yes.

43:36.572 --> 43:37.865
-I'm doing it.
-Okay.

43:38.324 --> 43:40.367
-I'm going now.
-Yes. You can do it.

43:42.244 --> 43:45.122
-Oh, I did it!
-I told you.

43:45.539 --> 43:48.667
You can do it if you trust me.
Good job.

43:48.751 --> 43:50.544
I'm so proud of you.

43:51.670 --> 43:52.671
What is this?

43:53.756 --> 43:54.965
I feel like a puppy.

43:55.215 --> 43:56.884
Are you a puppy that drives?

43:57.468 --> 43:58.719
Oh, how cute.

44:00.804 --> 44:01.889
I can drive.

44:02.056 --> 44:05.184
What? That's a puppy and cat mix.

44:05.267 --> 44:07.519
Yeah. I'm a dog, cat, human mix.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.689
What the heck is that?
How crazy.

44:10.773 --> 44:14.693
A dog, cat, human
who is the wife of a time traveler.

44:19.490 --> 44:20.824
It's quite strange.

44:20.949 --> 44:24.036
When I'm with you,
all I can see is you.

44:24.161 --> 44:25.704
I can't think of anything else.

44:25.788 --> 44:29.249
That's the magic of the dog, cat, human.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.632
Just lie down.

44:37.091 --> 44:38.634
How awkward.

44:38.967 --> 44:40.678
What's so awkward about it?

44:40.844 --> 44:42.471
I feel very awkward.

44:43.097 --> 44:46.934
I kissed you first,
but why are you so bold today?

44:48.477 --> 44:49.520
I love you.

44:51.063 --> 44:51.939
Oh my.

44:55.609 --> 44:57.277
Let's lie down here.

44:58.737 --> 44:59.571
Okay.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.658
I'll lie down and look at you.

45:06.578 --> 45:08.580
Can you tell me now?

45:09.873 --> 45:10.958
Tell you what?

45:13.252 --> 45:18.465
How did you end up
going to the other world?

45:20.008 --> 45:21.635
How do you get there?

45:28.100 --> 45:29.101
The subway.

45:31.061 --> 45:31.979
Subway?

45:33.605 --> 45:35.774
From Namyeong Station
to Seoul Station.

45:36.775 --> 45:41.530
The subway departs
and it's one minute and 30 seconds.

45:43.866 --> 45:45.367
What do you mean?

45:47.828 --> 45:52.583
Once we pass the accident site
of the Namyeong Station accident...

45:53.917 --> 45:55.335
I end up in the future.

45:57.963 --> 46:00.758
You travel to the future
on the subway?

46:02.134 --> 46:02.968
Yes.

46:04.428 --> 46:06.680
The subway that
people go to and from work on?

46:08.849 --> 46:13.020
I can choose where to go based
on my feelings.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.612
I can't believe it.

46:22.237 --> 46:23.614
I felt that way, at first.

46:24.823 --> 46:27.451
Then I realized it was real.

46:27.951 --> 46:29.453
It felt like the world was mine.

46:29.536 --> 46:31.455
I can really go to the future?

46:32.206 --> 46:34.458
This here is 2015?

46:34.625 --> 46:36.084
You're embarrassing me.

46:36.168 --> 46:37.085
This is insane!

46:37.795 --> 46:39.338
Hey. Look at these.

46:39.588 --> 46:41.965
-These are 2015 model phones.
-Wow!

46:42.257 --> 46:44.510
Wow. It's so futuristic.

46:44.718 --> 46:46.720
Wow, it's cool.

46:47.513 --> 46:50.015
I can really travel back
and forth from the future?

46:50.265 --> 46:52.684
Mister, I'm going to get rich.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.561
Isn't that unfair?

46:55.604 --> 46:56.814
It's discrimination.

46:58.941 --> 47:02.945
I was a survivor in that accident too.
Why is it only possible for you?

47:04.530 --> 47:06.907
I don't really know either.

47:08.283 --> 47:09.952
I don't know
if it has anything to do

47:10.869 --> 47:12.287
with surviving that accident.

47:14.331 --> 47:17.793
If you have a subway pass,
you can travel to the future.

47:19.545 --> 47:20.462
That's a cheap fare.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.759
But, Realtor.

47:28.136 --> 47:32.224
My driving is improving daily.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.936
I can drive for you
when you need me to.

47:37.813 --> 47:40.190
Can't you avoid
using public transit?

47:43.193 --> 47:47.573
I'd like it
if you didn't take the subway.

47:55.414 --> 47:57.416
I'd like it
if you didn't take the subway.

47:58.500 --> 48:02.754
No matter what the future holds
or what happens tomorrow...

48:05.132 --> 48:09.094
can't we just live freely?

48:09.845 --> 48:12.764
We can just live and have fun.

48:13.140 --> 48:14.600
Aren't you curious?

48:15.475 --> 48:17.227
About what will happen to us?

48:20.856 --> 48:22.274
You're not here though.

48:24.401 --> 48:26.403
When you travel to another time,

48:27.362 --> 48:28.864
you're not here.

48:30.991 --> 48:34.578
It bothers me that you go
to a place where I can't find you.

48:36.705 --> 48:40.667
I worry that you'll disappear
and you won't be able to come back.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.755
Imagining you not being here...

48:46.590 --> 48:48.050
I feel so alone.

48:49.009 --> 48:53.972
It feels like there's a cold wind
blowing on my heart.

48:57.059 --> 48:59.394
So, don't go off
where I can't find you.

49:03.357 --> 49:04.191
I have to go.

49:05.734 --> 49:08.779
Why? Because of Se-young's father?

49:09.696 --> 49:11.239
-No.
-Then what?

49:13.533 --> 49:14.368
To see land?

49:16.662 --> 49:17.496
Yes.

49:18.163 --> 49:20.457
But, I'm asking you like this.

49:21.667 --> 49:23.669
Just try working hard.

49:24.878 --> 49:27.965
No. I'm going to go.

49:28.924 --> 49:31.969
I need to go in order for us to live well.

49:32.719 --> 49:35.847
Also, there are so many fun things
in the other world.

49:36.932 --> 49:38.809
You can't even imagine it.

49:39.810 --> 49:42.270
Must you do
everything you want to?

49:45.565 --> 49:47.901
From Namyeong Station
to Seoul Station.

49:47.985 --> 49:51.905
The subway departs
and it's one minute and 30 seconds.

49:52.155 --> 49:54.616
Once we pass the site
of the Namyeong Station accident,

49:54.825 --> 49:55.993
I end up in the future.

49:57.077 --> 49:59.079
Maybe that could happen to me.

49:59.788 --> 50:00.706
Yu So-joon.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.834
If you insist on going back and forth,

50:04.418 --> 50:06.420
I will follow you to the future.

50:07.254 --> 50:08.755
If you die, I'll die with you.

50:09.214 --> 50:10.716
If you live, we live together.

50:18.306 --> 50:20.142
One minute and 30 seconds.

50:20.225 --> 50:23.520
Next up is Seoul Station.

50:24.146 --> 50:26.523
The door is on your right.

50:32.112 --> 50:33.780
Darn it. It's not working.

50:58.638 --> 50:59.765
What year is it?

51:00.098 --> 51:02.809
What? It's 2016.

51:30.670 --> 51:32.380
It must not work for me.

51:33.423 --> 51:35.425
Maybe I need to try more.

51:36.134 --> 51:37.469
I'm so tired.

51:38.762 --> 51:40.222
Oh gosh.

51:44.768 --> 51:45.727
Yu So-joon?

52:02.661 --> 52:03.495
Hey.

52:04.496 --> 52:05.413
Why are you here?

52:06.289 --> 52:07.541
You're going again?

52:08.250 --> 52:10.043
You go as often as you eat.

52:13.046 --> 52:13.964
Why did you come?

52:14.047 --> 52:17.342
What? I'm a Seoul citizen
taking the subway.

52:17.551 --> 52:19.010
Is something wrong with that?

52:19.511 --> 52:21.346
I told you to stop going.

52:21.429 --> 52:24.266
I'm sorry, but I'm going to disappear.

52:25.642 --> 52:27.853
I'm going to disappear soon.

52:29.563 --> 52:30.939
Just don't go.

52:31.022 --> 52:32.649
I can't control that.

52:33.525 --> 52:36.069
Don't go. You don't have to go.

52:40.198 --> 52:41.074
Sorry.

53:07.517 --> 53:09.060
Why am I crying?

53:24.910 --> 53:26.912
MARCH 24, 2019:
DAY BEFORE ACCIDENT

53:26.995 --> 53:30.081
D-1 The biggest fire work event
brings out tomorrow night

53:35.670 --> 53:38.798
I came to the last day
I could on my own.

53:40.050 --> 53:42.969
To the day before our last day.

53:48.725 --> 53:52.354
I wanted to see
how Ma-rin was living.

54:14.501 --> 54:16.086
She's a good driver now.

54:17.712 --> 54:19.381
I don't need to worry.

55:06.803 --> 55:08.555
Ma-rin still can't forget you.

55:08.722 --> 55:11.725
She lives alone in your house
and waits for you.

55:27.866 --> 55:28.992
Have you been well?

55:47.886 --> 55:48.845
Go over there.

55:54.392 --> 55:56.394
Song Ma-rin Photo Exhibition

56:03.401 --> 56:05.153
I feel so bad for Ma-rin.

56:05.403 --> 56:07.781
I don't think her husband
is abroad, right?

56:08.031 --> 56:10.575
Yeah. There were
lots of pictures of him.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.577
He didn't even come
on a day like today.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.371
What happened to them?

56:14.454 --> 56:15.789
They didn't get a divorce.

56:16.039 --> 56:17.082
I know.

56:17.332 --> 56:19.334
Her husband suddenly disappeared.

56:19.459 --> 56:21.169
Ma-rin's just waiting for him.

56:21.669 --> 56:23.505
-Hasn't it been two years already?
-Yeah.

56:24.297 --> 56:26.299
I don't know what's going on.

56:27.675 --> 56:29.386
Hey, let's just go eat something.

56:30.011 --> 56:32.013
Yeah, let's do that.

56:48.905 --> 56:53.368
Song Ma-rin Photo Exhibition

56:58.998 --> 57:02.419
Gosh. Good job.

57:03.461 --> 57:06.965
Let's go. We'll come tomorrow.

57:12.804 --> 57:15.306
What's with that expression
on a good day?

57:15.682 --> 57:17.642
Once you make it,
you forget the hard times.

57:17.725 --> 57:20.812
Photo exhibition!
You talked about it all the time

57:21.479 --> 57:23.481
What? I'm glad.

57:26.109 --> 57:28.445
Isn't it about time you forgot him?

57:29.737 --> 57:32.198
You have a photo exhibition now.

57:33.741 --> 57:36.327
You have to live your life now.

57:38.538 --> 57:40.123
How can I forget him?

57:40.999 --> 57:43.001
I don't know if he's dead or alive.

57:43.293 --> 57:45.295
I don't know where he is.

57:46.546 --> 57:47.964
How can I forget him?

57:52.427 --> 57:55.054
It would have been nice
to be together on a day like this.

58:02.520 --> 58:04.522
-Let's go.
-Okay. Let's go.

58:18.286 --> 58:19.621
I'll drop you off on the way.

58:20.121 --> 58:22.665
No, I have to stop by somewhere.

58:23.041 --> 58:25.043
Yeah? Okay.

58:25.335 --> 58:27.337
-Get home safely.
-Bye!

58:51.736 --> 58:54.489
<i>Ma-rin still goes</i>
<i>to Namyeong Station</i>

58:54.989 --> 58:56.991
<i>every few days and waits all day.</i>

58:57.659 --> 58:59.661
<i>She's hoping you might come back.</i>

59:04.791 --> 59:07.418
<i>You don't even know</i>
<i>what will happen to you tomorrow.</i>

59:08.211 --> 59:09.587
<i>Why are you here like this?</i>

59:19.389 --> 59:20.390
Mister.

59:22.850 --> 59:24.852
Mister, come on out.

59:26.604 --> 59:27.522
Tomorrow...

59:28.314 --> 59:30.149
Tomorrow is the last day.

59:31.317 --> 59:32.860
What will happen to Ma-rin?

59:32.986 --> 59:34.988
Does it end like that?

59:36.239 --> 59:40.493
Will she just wait for me
and then things end for her?

59:43.705 --> 59:47.917
I take back what I said to you
to not interfere with my life.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.794
Please help me.

59:50.837 --> 59:53.631
You must know everything
that's going to happen tomorrow.

59:54.632 --> 59:55.758
Mister!

59:56.426 --> 59:58.636
Excuse me. Who are you?

1:00:00.388 --> 1:00:02.932
This is our place. Who are you?

1:00:07.770 --> 1:00:08.605
I'm sorry.

1:00:55.401 --> 1:00:56.653
You disappeared like that.

1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:58.863
Why did you come back so late?

1:00:59.864 --> 1:01:01.866
Did you wait for me?

1:01:02.325 --> 1:01:04.535
Yes, I waited for you.

1:01:05.203 --> 1:01:06.037
Why?

1:01:07.413 --> 1:01:09.582
-What?
-You didn't know when I'd be back.

1:01:09.999 --> 1:01:11.000
Why did you wait?

1:01:11.751 --> 1:01:13.336
Why would you be foolish and wait?

1:01:16.631 --> 1:01:18.633
I waited because I was worried.

1:01:18.925 --> 1:01:19.884
Don't wait.

1:01:21.010 --> 1:01:22.679
It burdens me to have you waiting.

1:01:26.099 --> 1:01:29.185
That's all you can say to me now?

1:02:09.517 --> 1:02:11.769
You disappeared
right in front of me.

1:02:13.855 --> 1:02:16.274
I had your hand in mine,
but you disappeared.

1:02:20.153 --> 1:02:23.072
Can't you consider how shocked
and worried I must've been?

1:02:25.158 --> 1:02:26.409
How could I not wait?

1:02:27.368 --> 1:02:28.745
I was worried to death.

1:02:28.828 --> 1:02:31.456
No matter
where I go or how late I am...

1:02:32.290 --> 1:02:35.001
you can do what you need to
and just live well.

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:36.669
Why are you so hung up on this?

1:02:38.254 --> 1:02:39.213
I...

1:02:40.590 --> 1:02:44.844
only recently found out
that you're different than others.

1:02:46.554 --> 1:02:49.432
You went through a hard time,
I was busy worrying about you.

1:02:50.933 --> 1:02:54.729
I had no time to even think
about how we should live our life.

1:02:56.355 --> 1:02:59.567
Don't you even care or worry
about how confusing this is for me?

1:03:00.401 --> 1:03:01.986
Do you not see me beside you?

1:03:03.905 --> 1:03:06.282
So, what would you like me to do?

1:03:08.993 --> 1:03:12.413
What can I do
that would appease you?

1:03:16.834 --> 1:03:18.419
I'll ask you one last time.

1:03:20.254 --> 1:03:21.214
Don't go.

1:03:24.008 --> 1:03:25.927
Don't disappear from my sight.

1:03:27.678 --> 1:03:30.431
It scares me and makes me so anxious.

1:03:31.307 --> 1:03:32.934
It worries me so much.

1:03:34.894 --> 1:03:37.104
I don't have the confidence
to live like this.

1:03:39.982 --> 1:03:40.817
Okay.

1:03:41.776 --> 1:03:42.693
Let's do that then.

1:03:45.530 --> 1:03:46.405
What?

1:03:46.823 --> 1:03:48.825
Marrying you...

1:03:49.951 --> 1:03:51.869
I think that might
have been my mistake.

1:03:55.122 --> 1:03:55.957
We...

1:03:58.376 --> 1:03:59.794
should re-think things.

1:04:28.614 --> 1:04:30.449
You think marrying me
was a mistake?

1:04:30.533 --> 1:04:31.450
I'm your mistake?

1:04:31.576 --> 1:04:33.619
What do you want me to do?

1:04:33.703 --> 1:04:35.580
You can't with Kim Yong-jin!

1:04:35.955 --> 1:04:38.457
A crime was committed,
there should be punishment.

1:04:38.541 --> 1:04:41.586
Suddenly, his back is so chilly
and it's so scary.

1:04:41.669 --> 1:04:44.088
This is what his face is like.
Like it's so unfair.

1:04:44.338 --> 1:04:47.133
Do you know how I raised my Bap-soon?

1:04:47.216 --> 1:04:48.593
-Mother.
-I treated you well.

1:04:48.676 --> 1:04:51.345
Is there a law saying people
have to live out one fate?

1:04:51.429 --> 1:04:52.847
Let's keep this short.

1:04:53.598 --> 1:04:55.892
Is it me or her?
Choose between us.

1:04:57.184 --> 1:04:58.477
