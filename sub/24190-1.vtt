00:46.542 --> 00:49.376
In the early 16th century,
for many Spaniards driven

00:49.501 --> 00:52.376
by hunger and poverty to become soldiers,
the newly discovered Indies

00:52.501 --> 00:55.501
offered dreams of fame and fortune.
And a great number traveled there,

00:55.667 --> 00:58.667
with everything to gain
and nothing to lose, except their lives.

00:58.876 --> 01:01.876
They were harsh, arrogant, cruel,
often divided by quarrels and birthplaces.

01:05.042 --> 01:07.376
They killed without scruples
and died without protest,

01:07.501 --> 01:10.501
in search of gold, but while they
marched towards the unknown,

01:10.667 --> 01:13.667
these men and women
unwittingly shed light

01:13.834 --> 01:16.376
on a new world and an amazing feat.

01:25.084 --> 01:32.459
THE INDIES, 1538

01:41.167 --> 01:44.792
<i>My name is Martín Dávila,
king's soldier.</i>

01:46.001 --> 01:48.959
<i>Today is the hundredth day
since I landed in Sanlúcar</i>

01:49.126 --> 01:52.876
<i>to reach the new lands
in search of fame and fortune.</i>

01:54.001 --> 01:57.501
<i>I'm part of an exploration
in search of the City of Gold,</i>

01:57.834 --> 02:00.292
<i>which the Indians call Tezutlán,</i>

02:00.542 --> 02:04.001
<i>whose roofs they say
are made of pure gold.</i>

02:06.626 --> 02:09.667
<i>To reach it we'll have to cross
lands never seen,</i>

02:10.251 --> 02:11.542
<i>nor heard,</i>

02:12.209 --> 02:13.917
<i>nor ever dreamt before.</i>

02:20.876 --> 02:24.292
<i>To relate our fights
with hostile Indians,</i>

02:25.001 --> 02:27.334
<i>describe our hardships,</i>

02:28.417 --> 02:30.376
<i>remember our dead,</i>

02:31.084 --> 02:33.001
<i>record our greed,</i>

02:33.167 --> 02:36.959
<i>and avoid the passage of time
taking us for storytellers,</i>

02:37.209 --> 02:42.042
<i>the king has entrusted his scribe,
the scholar Ulzama.</i>

02:44.751 --> 02:46.126
<i>4th of April.</i>

02:46.876 --> 02:50.501
<i>After a skirmish with hostile Indians
in which we lost seven men,</i>

02:50.626 --> 02:52.959
<i>we continue towards
the City of Gold on the map</i>

02:53.126 --> 02:56.084
<i>made by the explorer Iñigo Labastida
8 years ago</i>

02:56.251 --> 02:59.126
<i>before returning ill to Puerto Cristo
and dying of fever.</i>

02:59.584 --> 03:02.667
<i>My occupation as the king's scribe
is to be an eyewitness,</i>

03:02.876 --> 03:05.917
<i>relate the facts and certify
once the gold is found</i>

03:06.084 --> 03:08.542
<i>that our emperor the king
receives one fifth of its totality.</i>

03:09.667 --> 03:13.292
<i>Governor Mendoza put Don Gonzalo de Baztán
in charge of the expedition,</i>

03:13.459 --> 03:14.959
<i>Navarran like him.</i>

03:15.126 --> 03:18.626
<i>He's an old soldier, but his best years
are long behind him.</i>

03:18.792 --> 03:20.959
<i>Troubled with melancholy,
he's unpredictable,</i>

03:21.126 --> 03:23.501
<i>indecisive and excessively
authoritarian.</i>

03:23.626 --> 03:26.626
<i>To heighten confusion,
and despite being advised against it,</i>

03:26.792 --> 03:29.459
<i>he brought along his wife,
Doña Ana Baztán,</i>

03:29.834 --> 03:31.792
<i>much younger than him.</i>

03:32.334 --> 03:36.501
<i>She's pretty, graceful
and has the spirit of a dreamer.</i>

03:36.876 --> 03:38.501
<i>The men covet her and hate her,</i>

03:38.626 --> 03:42.251
<i>for they think Don Gonzalo
only cares after her well-being.</i>

03:44.292 --> 03:46.959
<i>The second-in-charge,
Lieutenant Gorriamendi,</i>

03:47.126 --> 03:48.501
<i>is a veteran of the indies,</i>

03:48.667 --> 03:51.459
<i>accustomed to the climate
and hardships of these lands.</i>

03:51.834 --> 03:54.501
<i>He forged character and fame
hunting Indian slaves.</i>

03:54.626 --> 03:56.626
<i>The men fear and respect him.</i>

03:57.917 --> 04:01.667
<i>Nearly one third of the expedition are
veterans of the emperor's wars in Italy,</i>

04:01.834 --> 04:03.501
<i>like Sergeant Bastaurrés.</i>

04:04.626 --> 04:07.209
<i>The spiritual part is handled
by Father Vargas,</i>

04:07.376 --> 04:10.126
<i>a moody, intransigent,
fanatical Black Friar,</i>

04:10.292 --> 04:12.376
<i>always looking for vile sinners.</i>

04:14.709 --> 04:17.209
<i>The rest are recent arrivals
from Spain.</i>

04:17.416 --> 04:20.166
<i>Boastful men always quarreling
over geography.</i>

04:20.334 --> 04:23.417
<i>They form groups and keep their
distance according to their region.</i>

04:23.542 --> 04:24.542
<i>Typical Spaniards.</i>

04:24.792 --> 04:27.084
<i>But when it's time to fight Indians
and face danger,</i>

04:27.251 --> 04:30.126
<i>the quarrels vanish
and they fight side by side.</i>

04:30.667 --> 04:32.792
<i>Men with nothing to lose
and everything to gain</i>

04:33.001 --> 04:35.001
<i>if they survive this expedition.</i>

04:35.292 --> 04:36.876
<i>Men determined not to languish</i>

04:37.084 --> 04:40.501
<i>ploughing the thankless, dry,
God-forsaken lands of Spain.</i>

04:40.626 --> 04:42.126
<i>That's why they seek gold,</i>

04:42.292 --> 04:45.334
<i>to grow old like nobleman,
indebted to no one.</i>

04:45.501 --> 04:47.709
<i>For they will have earned
every last piece of gold</i>

04:47.917 --> 04:51.626
<i>with their blood, dangers,
wounds and fears.</i>

04:51.792 --> 04:53.542
She's not the right woman for you.

04:57.126 --> 04:58.126
Caribes.

04:59.459 --> 05:00.876
Romero, Mediano,

05:01.042 --> 05:03.001
Barbate and Martín Dávila.

05:03.209 --> 05:05.376
Take the rearguard
with the sergeant.

05:06.417 --> 05:07.584
Son of a bitch.

05:07.751 --> 05:10.959
Aragonese and Andalusians
always take the guard or the rearguard.

05:11.126 --> 05:14.001
You heard the orders.
Rearguard.

05:15.209 --> 05:17.292
You should be giving the orders.

05:17.459 --> 05:18.751
Keep quiet.

05:39.626 --> 05:42.459
Mediano, stay fifty steps behind.

05:59.334 --> 06:02.001
Well? What happened to Mediano?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.542
The Indians took him.

06:06.292 --> 06:10.001
Maybe being Aragonese he shit himself
and ran off with them.

06:14.626 --> 06:17.167
Say that again
and I'll slit your soul.

06:17.334 --> 06:18.501
By yourself?

06:34.084 --> 06:42.084
GOLD

07:05.667 --> 07:06.792
Olite.

07:08.001 --> 07:09.126
Cross.

07:12.417 --> 07:16.042
Sir, if you don't mind,
the sergeant and I will go first.

08:15.376 --> 08:16.667
Where are you from?

08:17.084 --> 08:18.584
Extremadura.

08:19.084 --> 08:21.334
Bad lands, good people.

08:22.292 --> 08:27.126
<i>Today we lost soldier Mediano
to an Indian attack.</i>

08:27.917 --> 08:30.001
And soldiers Recarte and Muntels,

08:30.501 --> 08:33.667
eaten by a monster
the people here call a caiman.

08:34.417 --> 08:38.042
Mediano's share of the gold,
according to his will,

08:38.458 --> 08:39.917
will go to young Pedro,

08:40.083 --> 08:42.501
who is obliged to deliver it
to his family.

08:43.042 --> 08:46.417
Soldiers Recarte and Muntels
will leave no inheritance.

08:46.876 --> 08:50.709
Their shares will be divided by those
still alive when we find the gold.

08:52.001 --> 08:54.042
Let's go, set up camp.

09:03.917 --> 09:06.709
Priests so close bring bad luck.

09:06.876 --> 09:09.126
Martín, you'll do the first watch.

09:19.042 --> 09:23.542
In Puerto Cristo they said Don Gonzalo
brought her from a brothel in Cuba.

09:23.709 --> 09:26.542
I don't care if she's a whore,
a Hebrew or a Saracen.

09:26.792 --> 09:29.084
When I'm rich,
I want a woman like that.

09:29.251 --> 09:30.584
What would you do with her?

09:30.751 --> 09:33.459
Everything.
In front and from behind.

09:33.584 --> 09:35.751
I prefer paying for whores.

09:35.917 --> 09:39.751
In the long term, even in the short term,
they're cheaper.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.001
Marchena.

10:04.084 --> 10:05.751
Sing something for me.

10:12.501 --> 10:17.126
<i>Mother, I come from the poplar trees.</i>

10:17.626 --> 10:21.209
<i>I saw them shaking in the breeze.</i>

10:22.334 --> 10:26.876
<i>The poplars in Seville where</i>

10:27.709 --> 10:31.917
<i>I saw my friend so fair.</i>

10:32.667 --> 10:37.501
<i>Mother, I come from the poplar trees.</i>

10:37.792 --> 10:42.126
<i>I saw them shaking in the breeze.</i>

10:42.626 --> 10:46.584
<i>The poplars in Seville where</i>

10:48.084 --> 10:52.334
<i>I saw my friend so fair.</i>

10:55.251 --> 10:56.251
What?

11:00.251 --> 11:02.001
Go on, fetch.

11:03.292 --> 11:07.459
<i>The poplars in Seville where...</i>

11:20.876 --> 11:22.042
Who are you?

11:23.417 --> 11:25.126
I was baptized Jeromillo.

11:25.292 --> 11:28.251
I've come from Puerto Cristo
to speak with Don Gonzalo.

11:28.417 --> 11:31.501
Release him.
He's my property.

11:35.126 --> 11:36.709
What's happening, Sergeant?

11:38.501 --> 11:39.917
Nothing good.

11:43.334 --> 11:46.542
Talk to your Navarran friend,
see if he finds out anything.

11:47.209 --> 11:50.876
He sleeps with Doña Ana's maidservant
every night.

11:56.209 --> 11:57.417
Iturbe.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.501
Something strange is happening.

12:03.626 --> 12:05.251
Yes, it looks like it.

12:05.584 --> 12:08.459
Doña Ana might tell La Parda
something.

12:10.126 --> 12:12.709
If she does, tonight we'll know.

12:19.251 --> 12:20.709
Let's go!

12:26.459 --> 12:28.334
I said let's go!

12:28.501 --> 12:29.917
We want to talk to Don Gonzalo.

12:30.126 --> 12:31.501
Who names me?

12:33.042 --> 12:34.959
Martín Dávila, king's soldier, sir.

12:35.209 --> 12:38.542
- I wish to speak on behalf of the men.
- There's no time to chat.

12:39.042 --> 12:40.334
Then find time.

12:40.501 --> 12:43.792
I think the jungle has softened
your skull.

12:44.001 --> 12:45.501
To my knowledge, these new lands

12:45.626 --> 12:49.417
- were not conquered by nuns.
- With all due respect,

12:50.292 --> 12:53.126
I do not see nuns around me,

12:53.292 --> 12:54.001
but soldiers.

12:54.167 --> 12:57.334
Iturbe, Navarran like myself.
What do you think?

12:57.501 --> 13:00.751
Are we with soldiers or nuns?

13:01.834 --> 13:04.042
I'm half-Navarran,
and with all due respect,

13:04.501 --> 13:07.417
I don't like being compared to nuns.

13:18.334 --> 13:19.376
Very well.

13:19.792 --> 13:21.084
What do you want to know?

13:21.376 --> 13:24.501
The news the Indian Jeromillo
brought from Puerto Cristo.

13:25.501 --> 13:27.792
A few days after we left Puerto Cristo,

13:28.042 --> 13:31.501
an envoy sent by the viceroy
arrived to substitute Governor Mendoza.

13:31.917 --> 13:34.126
The new governor
has sent an expedition

13:34.292 --> 13:36.209
to find us led by Don Juan Medrano.

13:36.542 --> 13:38.417
His orders are to arrest me,

13:38.584 --> 13:42.626
put me in irons and escort me
back to Puerto Cristo.

13:42.792 --> 13:43.792
For what reason?

13:44.459 --> 13:49.501
The viceroy heard about the City of Gold
and he wants it all for himself.

13:50.001 --> 13:52.751
He's incarcerated Governor Mendoza,

13:52.959 --> 13:55.251
accusing him of treason.
And he wants me hanged.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.459
Which means that

13:56.584 --> 14:01.042
if Medrano's expedition catches us,
we'll have to share the gold with his men.

14:01.334 --> 14:02.459
That's right.

14:02.626 --> 14:04.126
But that's the best case scenario.

14:04.751 --> 14:06.042
And the worst?

14:06.376 --> 14:08.376
That after they hang us for treason,

14:09.209 --> 14:12.792
Don Gonzalo, the sergeant and me
as leaders of the expedition,

14:13.626 --> 14:15.501
they'll kill you all.

14:15.751 --> 14:18.376
So they won't have to share
the gold with you.

14:18.501 --> 14:21.084
I don't like either of the possibilities.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.584
Neither do I.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.792
We'll have to make a decision.

14:33.709 --> 14:36.959
Those who choose to continue
with Don Gonzalo,

14:37.126 --> 14:38.584
cross the line.

14:38.876 --> 14:42.126
Those who'd rather wait
for Don Medrano's expedition,

14:42.292 --> 14:44.042
stay where you are.

14:44.376 --> 14:46.459
To avoid misunderstandings,

14:46.667 --> 14:49.792
those who cross the line
must know that that step

14:50.167 --> 14:53.626
will force us to take up arms
against the men pursuing us

14:53.792 --> 14:57.542
and put us in direct rebellion
against the viceroy.

14:57.709 --> 14:59.751
Rebellion against the viceroy,

15:00.376 --> 15:01.834
but not God

15:02.042 --> 15:03.626
or His church,

15:04.459 --> 15:06.376
for we will share our riches
with it

15:06.501 --> 15:11.376
to help convert the savages
still in the devil's hands.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.667
Gonzalo, we're at war.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.751
If you don't take control,
they'll kill us.

15:33.667 --> 15:37.001
If the scholar doesn't cross the line,
we're lost.

15:37.334 --> 15:40.751
He'd turn us into outlaws
in rebellion against our king.

15:40.959 --> 15:43.542
That I won't do for all the gold
in the world.

15:47.417 --> 15:48.876
I propose that to prove

15:49.042 --> 15:52.751
our faithfulness to the king
we raise his share to two-fifths.

16:04.751 --> 16:07.376
Anyone against the soldier's proposal?

16:10.584 --> 16:11.584
Then I shall relay

16:11.751 --> 16:16.001
the soldiers' decision so that
the emperor king has a record of it.

16:27.584 --> 16:30.084
<i>Today is the sixth day
since we got the news</i>

16:30.251 --> 16:33.251
<i>that Don Juan Medrano was chasing us
on orders from the viceroy</i>

16:33.459 --> 16:37.792
<i>and that the soldiers I accompany
refuse to disown the Kingdom of Castille.</i>

16:38.792 --> 16:41.542
<i>According to Labastida's map,
the gold is still far away.</i>

16:41.917 --> 16:45.042
<i>But there's another booty to be had.
The indigenous women.</i>

16:45.584 --> 16:48.251
<i>When we find them,
we split them among the soldiers.</i>

16:48.417 --> 16:51.917
<i>But sometimes that causes disputes
and weapons are drawn.</i>

16:53.167 --> 16:55.042
What's all this shouting about?

16:55.542 --> 16:57.376
Soldiers quarreling, sir.

16:57.501 --> 17:00.417
They're arguing over turns
sleeping with the Indian girls.

17:00.542 --> 17:01.542
They can't agree.

17:01.709 --> 17:04.541
Release the Indians
and the dispute will be over.

17:05.084 --> 17:07.666
- That's not customary.
- But it's timely.

17:09.251 --> 17:10.626
You heard Don Gonzalo.

17:10.959 --> 17:12.791
Release the Indian girls.

17:18.541 --> 17:20.291
Let them go.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.166
Bastard!

17:23.541 --> 17:25.501
What did you say, soldier?

17:27.084 --> 17:30.376
I see that soldier Aresti,
besides being a stubborn Biscayan,

17:30.501 --> 17:32.251
is a scoundrel and a coward.

17:35.459 --> 17:37.167
Give him the garrote.

17:38.042 --> 17:39.167
Sir...

17:46.667 --> 17:48.751
If you're going to kill me,
use an arquebus,

17:48.959 --> 17:51.709
or have Lieutenant Gorriamendi
slit my throat, he has a steady hand.

17:51.917 --> 17:53.459
But not the garrote.

17:53.917 --> 17:58.126
It's an ungodly death for an old soldier
like me who fought in the emperor's wars.

17:58.334 --> 18:01.167
Let the record show
the soldier will die by the garrote

18:01.334 --> 18:03.134
for insolence against his superior
and mutiny.

18:04.001 --> 18:07.834
Let it also show that soldier Aresti
requested to die by arquebus or sword

18:08.042 --> 18:10.292
and that such a favor
was not granted.

18:10.459 --> 18:11.459
Let it show.

18:13.001 --> 18:14.042
Iturbe,

18:14.417 --> 18:15.542
the rope.

18:15.709 --> 18:16.709
Marchena,

18:17.542 --> 18:19.042
give him the garrote.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.542
Good luck.

18:33.917 --> 18:35.501
What town are you from?

18:35.667 --> 18:37.084
Bermeo.

18:37.376 --> 18:39.084
On your knees.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.751
Think of Bermeo, my friend.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.584
"Sacred land."

19:24.417 --> 19:25.709
"Mother jungle."

19:34.001 --> 19:35.459
"Great spirit."

19:41.501 --> 19:43.917
They say not only the roofs
are made of gold.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.709
Also the walls and floors
of the houses.

19:47.084 --> 19:48.417
And the mosquitoes.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.251
That keeps out the bugs
and bad thoughts.

20:15.084 --> 20:18.084
Who are you to speak
of bad thoughts?

20:18.626 --> 20:22.459
You think I don't know you see
that Navarran every night? What's his name?

20:22.584 --> 20:23.584
Iturbe.

20:24.876 --> 20:25.459
Iturbe...

20:25.584 --> 20:29.459
I'm a maidservant, we can do things
a lady cannot.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.542
He's only a soldier...

20:39.709 --> 20:40.876
Yes.

20:43.001 --> 20:45.084
But he stares at me.

20:46.501 --> 20:48.042
Like all of them.

20:48.501 --> 20:50.292
They all stare at you.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.042
He looks at me differently.

21:45.167 --> 21:46.334
Arquebuses!

21:46.501 --> 21:48.459
- Are you sure?
- Yes, nearby.

21:48.584 --> 21:49.209
Where?

21:49.376 --> 21:51.126
It's Medrano's men.

21:51.626 --> 21:55.751
You and you, check the rearguard
for scouts. Let's go!

22:02.126 --> 22:03.501
Go with them.

22:08.042 --> 22:09.917
By the nails of Christ.

22:11.042 --> 22:12.334
Jezebel.

22:18.042 --> 22:20.792
Now I have not only the soldiers
against me.

22:21.334 --> 22:23.251
I have God as well.

22:33.292 --> 22:34.709
I know him.

22:35.042 --> 22:36.042
He's Achache.

22:36.626 --> 22:38.667
One of Medrano's explorers.

22:39.292 --> 22:42.167
How far away are Medrano's men?

22:44.792 --> 22:47.751
Tell me how far away they are
or I'll kill you.

22:48.292 --> 22:50.501
He prefers death to treason.

22:51.001 --> 22:52.209
Leave him to me.

23:12.417 --> 23:13.667
He'll talk.

23:15.209 --> 23:16.667
What did you say to him?

23:18.959 --> 23:20.959
If he talks, his wife will be free
when he dies.

23:21.292 --> 23:25.167
If not, she'll be mine when he dies.
Young woman.

23:28.501 --> 23:30.209
How far away are they?

23:31.209 --> 23:32.209
One day.

24:09.667 --> 24:12.876
What do you think Medrano will do?
Will he come straight for us?

24:13.042 --> 24:17.834
No. Bad terrain to attack.
He'll seek advantage.

24:26.126 --> 24:27.834
We here.

24:28.251 --> 24:30.292
Medrano here.

24:31.917 --> 24:33.792
He'll walk fast.

24:34.251 --> 24:35.501
Here.

24:36.167 --> 24:38.042
To small mountain.

24:38.876 --> 24:42.501
When he above, we below...

24:43.667 --> 24:44.709
he'll attack.

24:44.876 --> 24:45.917
How do you know?

24:46.584 --> 24:48.126
He knows.

24:51.167 --> 24:54.792
Better go here...

24:56.584 --> 24:58.376
and trick him.

24:58.501 --> 25:00.084
Will lose days.

25:05.209 --> 25:06.417
But...?

25:09.167 --> 25:10.584
Caribe territory.

25:20.584 --> 25:22.001
Shitty jungle.

25:22.167 --> 25:24.667
Soldier. No get angry with jungle.

25:24.959 --> 25:26.459
If you against her,

25:26.584 --> 25:29.917
she put hand in your chest
and pull out heart.

25:30.126 --> 25:33.251
And then take sword.
And you not soldier anymore.

25:33.417 --> 25:34.876
You crazy man.

25:42.459 --> 25:43.542
What's wrong?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.001
Caribes.

25:45.167 --> 25:46.876
Hostile or peaceful?

25:47.084 --> 25:50.876
All Indians hostile with soldiers.
This is their land.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.376
I don't see any Indians.

25:54.584 --> 25:56.417
But I won't argue with Mediamano.

25:56.542 --> 25:59.209
He sees and hears things we miss.

26:00.417 --> 26:01.542
No, no!

26:02.376 --> 26:04.876
If they wanted to kill you,
they already would have.

26:05.042 --> 26:07.501
We might be able to pass
without fighting.

26:07.626 --> 26:10.417
They more afraid of us
than us of them.

26:10.584 --> 26:12.251
Very afraid of this.

26:12.501 --> 26:14.126
And your dog.

26:14.292 --> 26:16.084
I agree with Mediamano.

26:17.542 --> 26:19.626
Fine, we'll pass without shooting.

26:19.792 --> 26:23.417
If they attack, fire the arquebuses first.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.501
Spread the word.

26:31.917 --> 26:33.376
Let's go!

26:34.126 --> 26:35.417
Lieutenant!

26:36.709 --> 26:40.584
Let that be the last time you give
a combat order without my permission.

26:40.751 --> 26:43.917
- Understood?
- Understood, sir.

26:44.126 --> 26:45.709
Let's go!

27:08.501 --> 27:11.292
First they'll kill Don Gonzalo,
then you.

27:13.376 --> 27:16.876
You need to find a protector,
and it can't be your soldier.

27:17.167 --> 27:18.501
Who knows?

27:18.959 --> 27:20.626
I do, and so do you.

27:20.792 --> 27:23.542
- He has no command.
- He will.

27:23.792 --> 27:27.126
When? There's no time,
we can't wait.

27:27.792 --> 27:29.834
- The lieutenant...
- Not the lieutenant.

27:30.042 --> 27:33.167
He'd treat me like one of those Indians
he lives with in Puerto Cristo.

27:33.334 --> 27:36.667
Better a live Indian than a dead Christian.

27:43.126 --> 27:44.876
You have to do me a favor.

27:45.084 --> 27:46.209
What?

27:48.667 --> 27:50.042
You're crazy.

28:01.376 --> 28:02.876
Hello, soldier.

28:03.501 --> 28:04.751
Madam.

28:05.917 --> 28:07.167
Come.

28:18.001 --> 28:19.917
Why did you want to see me?

28:20.751 --> 28:22.459
To thank you.

28:23.001 --> 28:25.292
You've saved my life twice.

28:27.292 --> 28:30.459
And to tell you that I'm not like
the other soldiers think.

28:32.209 --> 28:33.501
I know.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.626
I'm not a peasant either.

28:36.792 --> 28:38.501
I haven't been for many years.

28:40.126 --> 28:41.626
Where are you from?

28:41.917 --> 28:43.334
Trujillo.

28:44.001 --> 28:46.042
But I left when I was very young.

28:46.459 --> 28:49.667
I've never gone back,
and probably never will.

28:50.167 --> 28:51.667
Why did you leave?

28:54.209 --> 28:56.209
I wanted to see the world.

28:57.042 --> 28:58.667
See the world...

28:59.792 --> 29:01.126
How lucky.

29:03.376 --> 29:05.917
I've only seen the farmhouse
in Baztán,

29:06.876 --> 29:09.126
Puerto Cristo and this.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.709
I wasn't allowed to see Seville
when we set sail. Have you?

29:15.209 --> 29:16.667
What's it like?

29:17.292 --> 29:19.001
It has it all.

29:20.376 --> 29:22.542
Women too, I suppose.

29:23.459 --> 29:25.667
But none like you.

29:28.584 --> 29:30.501
I'm a married woman, soldier.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.126
I know.

29:37.584 --> 29:39.667
How I envy you.

29:39.834 --> 29:41.042
Yes.

29:41.542 --> 29:45.042
Ever since I was little, I've always wanted
to see new things.

29:45.792 --> 29:48.459
But I couldn't, my father arranged
my marriage

29:48.667 --> 29:50.792
to Don Gonzalo when I turned 14

29:51.001 --> 29:53.126
and since then I haven't...

29:53.834 --> 29:55.792
If I'm lucky and make it
out of here alive,

29:56.001 --> 29:59.081
soon I'll be nothing but an old woman
who's read "Tirant lo Blanch" 100 times.

30:05.292 --> 30:06.876
What are you doing here?

30:09.334 --> 30:12.751
"I'm a man of low standing
without a title."

30:14.584 --> 30:16.001
You've read "Tirant lo Blanch."

30:20.251 --> 30:22.251
You're a strange man, soldier.

30:23.001 --> 30:24.667
Because I read "Tirant lo Blanch?"

30:25.917 --> 30:27.667
That and for other reasons.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.501
Is he bothering you?

30:34.626 --> 30:35.626
No.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.209
We were talking about
his home town, Lieutenant.

30:39.792 --> 30:41.084
I'm glad.

30:41.292 --> 30:43.126
Don Gonzalo requires your presence.

30:44.167 --> 30:45.417
Well.

30:50.334 --> 30:51.584
What are you doing?

30:52.042 --> 30:54.292
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

30:54.459 --> 30:56.459
She's your captain's wife!

30:56.751 --> 30:58.376
And yours too.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.459
How long will you defend him?

31:04.042 --> 31:07.126
- I don't need anyone to defend me.
- Yes, you do.

31:07.584 --> 31:09.001
Very much so.

31:13.501 --> 31:14.959
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

31:15.501 --> 31:18.292
Don't be.
And stay alert.

31:19.334 --> 31:22.042
This is no time to lose your mind
over a woman.

31:22.209 --> 31:23.542
Not even her.

31:24.042 --> 31:27.459
Otherwise the lieutenant...
will kill you.

31:27.584 --> 31:29.001
And me too.

31:29.459 --> 31:33.126
He's been obsessed with her
ever since he saw her in Puerto Cristo.

31:33.292 --> 31:36.709
I don't want to go to Navarra.
It's too cold, I'll get chilblain.

31:36.876 --> 31:38.542
Romero said the tuna in Zahara...

31:38.709 --> 31:40.001
Yes, of course.

31:40.459 --> 31:42.459
What's in Zahara?
Tuna and whores.

31:42.584 --> 31:44.251
You want me watching you
all day?

31:44.417 --> 31:46.209
- Then Osuna.
- Well...

31:51.501 --> 31:53.626
A snake bit La Parda!

31:55.917 --> 31:56.917
Lie down.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.417
Parda, what's wrong?

32:01.542 --> 32:02.709
What happened?

32:02.876 --> 32:04.334
I can't breathe!

32:04.959 --> 32:06.876
No, no. It's okay.

32:07.042 --> 32:08.501
It's okay, Parda.

32:08.959 --> 32:11.501
- No, no, no. Please.
- I want them to bury me.

32:50.667 --> 32:52.084
Bury her!

32:52.626 --> 32:54.792
We're supposed to be in a hurry.

32:55.917 --> 32:58.876
That was the reason
we didn't bury our dead.

33:07.042 --> 33:08.417
Bury her.

33:12.084 --> 33:14.667
Romero and Carvajal, bury her.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.417
The rest of us will continue.

33:18.084 --> 33:20.376
Brave enough to give
old soldiers the garrote

33:20.501 --> 33:24.042
and too cowardly to govern a whore.
This is bad.

33:25.917 --> 33:27.792
Murmuring is for women.

33:28.167 --> 33:30.417
Men speak out loud
and to your face.

33:30.792 --> 33:34.501
Men also give orders,
not take them from a woman.

33:36.626 --> 33:38.584
- Son of a bitch!
- Lower your weapon.

33:38.751 --> 33:39.501
Son of a bitch!

33:39.626 --> 33:42.042
Lower your weapon
or you'll have to deal with me!

33:42.417 --> 33:45.292
We've fought together,
don't force me.

33:45.751 --> 33:49.042
Nobody's giving me the garrote
like Aresti for speaking the truth.

33:49.209 --> 33:50.584
- So get out of my way.
- Romero.

33:50.751 --> 33:52.001
Get out of my way.

33:52.167 --> 33:56.167
Move or I swear by the horns of Christ
that I'll kill you too!

34:01.501 --> 34:02.626
Marchena.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.167
Give him the garrote.

34:18.208 --> 34:19.417
Look at me.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.208
You'll die like a soldier.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.458
Let's go!

34:30.167 --> 34:32.042
Let's not waste any more time.

34:38.626 --> 34:41.001
The blasphemer is already
burning in hell.

34:41.167 --> 34:42.292
Bastard!

34:47.292 --> 34:49.917
Evil is taking control of you,
soldier.

34:50.126 --> 34:51.751
I can see it in your eyes.

34:52.251 --> 34:54.001
What do you see in mine?

34:54.501 --> 34:56.042
In yours, my son,

34:57.584 --> 35:02.001
I see lust and desire for the wife
of another man.

35:02.167 --> 35:03.376
Father,

35:04.167 --> 35:06.584
I think there are other souls
in need.

35:12.959 --> 35:14.751
One of these days I'll kill him.

35:14.959 --> 35:17.334
- And I'll help you.
- Don't speak madness.

35:18.084 --> 35:20.501
He's God's representative on Earth.

35:20.959 --> 35:23.709
If he is, then let God come down here.

35:23.917 --> 35:25.667
I'll kill Him too.

35:30.209 --> 35:31.834
<i>28th of April.</i>

35:32.251 --> 35:35.501
<i>The certainty that Don Juan Medrano
is hot on our tail</i>

35:35.626 --> 35:38.501
<i>has forced Lieutenant Gorriamendi
to send Mínguez and Rodríguez</i>

35:38.626 --> 35:41.751
<i>guided by the Indian Jeromillo
to make fires and leave signals</i>

35:41.917 --> 35:43.709
<i>to mislead our pursuers.</i>

35:45.292 --> 35:47.626
<i>But that's not our only worry.</i>

35:48.042 --> 35:51.501
<i>Don Gonzalo's lack of vigor
and his weakness with Doña Ana's whims</i>

35:51.626 --> 35:53.167
<i>agitate the soldiers.</i>

35:53.334 --> 35:57.167
<i>Rumors of mutiny
against the leadership abound.</i>

35:57.751 --> 36:00.709
<i>Today soldier Virués died
of the Black Vomit.</i>

36:03.626 --> 36:06.459
You. I have two things
to say to you.

36:08.042 --> 36:09.042
I'm listening.

36:09.501 --> 36:14.126
The first, that I, Juan de Gorriamendi,
am a soldier searching for gold.

36:15.042 --> 36:16.417
Like me.

36:16.751 --> 36:17.917
No.

36:18.292 --> 36:19.917
You fight like a soldier,

36:20.084 --> 36:22.167
but you don't think like
the rest of us.

36:22.626 --> 36:25.292
Nor do you seek what they do.

36:26.959 --> 36:28.376
And what do I seek,
if I may ask?

36:28.667 --> 36:30.376
You seek fame and fortune.

36:30.876 --> 36:33.667
I thought we all did,
you included.

36:33.917 --> 36:36.042
I seek gold.

36:37.292 --> 36:40.292
And gold and fame
don't always mix well.

36:40.751 --> 36:42.501
That's good to know.

36:43.292 --> 36:45.917
What was the second thing
you wanted to tell me?

36:46.167 --> 36:49.917
I imagine when you crossed
the ocean, you were hit by storms.

36:50.501 --> 36:53.042
We lost three ships in one.

36:53.417 --> 36:54.667
Too bad.

36:55.292 --> 36:59.376
But then you know that sometimes,
for the ship not to sink,

36:59.501 --> 37:02.126
you have to throw anything
necessary overboard.

37:02.292 --> 37:04.001
To keep the ship afloat.

37:04.501 --> 37:05.792
Do you understand?

37:06.876 --> 37:08.667
I understand perfectly.

37:09.042 --> 37:10.376
And I don't agree.

37:10.501 --> 37:13.042
Right, I imagined.

37:14.542 --> 37:17.334
That's why I wanted to tell you
the second thing.

37:18.459 --> 37:20.084
If you get in my way,

37:20.876 --> 37:23.709
you won't find the companion
you've had until now,

37:23.917 --> 37:26.167
but you will find the soldier.

37:27.042 --> 37:28.626
Is that clear?

37:32.292 --> 37:33.417
Good.

37:41.209 --> 37:43.084
Count me out.

37:49.501 --> 37:50.876
It's Jeromillo.

38:06.626 --> 38:08.542
What about Mínguez and Rodríguez?

38:08.751 --> 38:11.917
Dead in ambush.
Medrano's soldiers. I flee.

38:12.084 --> 38:13.376
Where's Medrano?

38:13.501 --> 38:15.209
Medrano wrong path.

38:16.167 --> 38:17.834
Will lose two or three days.

38:18.042 --> 38:19.042
Good.

38:19.292 --> 38:21.209
That's good news.

38:21.626 --> 38:23.626
Sergeant, pick a spot
to set up camp.

38:24.417 --> 38:25.542
Go on.

38:30.501 --> 38:31.751
Sergeant...

38:33.167 --> 38:35.501
I don't have time to chat
right now.

38:36.459 --> 38:40.126
Mediamano and Martín Dávila
will patrol while we set up camp.

38:43.084 --> 38:45.084
Why did you bring me here?

38:45.917 --> 38:47.751
So that you're safe.

38:48.751 --> 38:50.001
Safe from what?

38:50.167 --> 38:51.334
From getting killed.

38:51.626 --> 38:54.209
Sergeant doesn't want you
killed over woman.

38:55.751 --> 38:59.417
If you go back to camp,
you will get lost in jungle and die.

38:59.542 --> 39:00.667
Wait.

39:00.959 --> 39:03.167
It's better for you and for woman.

40:17.042 --> 40:18.417
Gonzalo, no...

40:19.167 --> 40:20.417
Gonzalo!

41:30.626 --> 41:32.042
Damn traitor!

42:18.959 --> 42:19.959
Bury him!

42:20.084 --> 42:21.626
I'll bury him.

42:22.334 --> 42:24.876
We fought together,
I owe it to him.

43:38.626 --> 43:40.334
<i>1st of May.</i>

43:41.667 --> 43:45.501
<i>Dawn breaks on the morning
after Don Gonzalo de Baztán's murder.</i>

43:47.167 --> 43:49.417
<i>The reasons for his death
are veiled behind fog</i>

43:49.542 --> 43:53.292
<i>and darkness that foreshadow
more misfortune and betrayal.</i>

43:55.459 --> 43:58.251
<i>A bad omen seems to be
surrounding the expedition.</i>

43:58.542 --> 44:00.584
<i>The immense jungle reminds us every day</i>

44:00.751 --> 44:04.459
<i>that man is but a bridge between stable
eternity and the flow of time.</i>

44:16.792 --> 44:19.709
<i>Today Mad Dog died,
hunter of hostile Indians.</i>

44:20.667 --> 44:23.292
<i>By the lieutenant's order,
his part will be shared by the men</i>

44:23.459 --> 44:25.501
<i>who remain when we find
the gold.</i>

44:48.876 --> 44:51.792
He's the captain now,
and she belongs to him.

44:52.167 --> 44:53.542
Forget her.

44:57.167 --> 44:58.501
From Doña Ana.

44:58.626 --> 45:01.417
To remember her,
now that she can't see you.

45:02.626 --> 45:04.084
I want to see her.

45:04.292 --> 45:06.167
You've got balls.

45:21.501 --> 45:22.626
Martín...

45:24.792 --> 45:28.376
Please, I don't want anything horrible
to happen to you because of me.

45:28.584 --> 45:30.584
After tonight,
you have to stay away from me.

45:30.751 --> 45:32.542
One night isn't enough, my lady.

45:34.126 --> 45:35.917
Don't call me lady.

45:37.501 --> 45:39.251
I'm not a lady.

45:40.042 --> 45:41.376
I'm nothing.

45:41.834 --> 45:43.292
Don't say that.

45:43.626 --> 45:45.834
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

45:46.501 --> 45:48.376
I'm sorry too.

45:49.917 --> 45:51.376
But I didn't know.

45:51.917 --> 45:52.959
I wanted to survive...

45:53.834 --> 45:55.584
What's done is done.

45:56.042 --> 45:57.751
Torture yourself no more.

45:58.001 --> 45:59.167
That's it.

46:04.167 --> 46:05.834
Only one night.

46:07.751 --> 46:09.501
I'll want more nights.

46:09.709 --> 46:12.376
I think I'll want every night.

46:14.001 --> 46:15.501
Better one night than none.

46:21.501 --> 46:23.126
We can't make any noise.

46:23.292 --> 46:24.751
I know.

46:27.251 --> 46:28.876
Treat me well.

46:56.501 --> 46:58.126
You have to go.

46:58.292 --> 46:59.917
You have to go.

47:32.709 --> 47:34.709
It gets rid of bad spirits.

47:42.751 --> 47:44.417
Have you got a wife?

47:45.751 --> 47:46.584
No.

47:46.751 --> 47:48.126
Dead.

47:49.376 --> 47:50.626
I'm sorry.

47:51.834 --> 47:54.292
I can't remember mine's face
anymore.

47:58.501 --> 48:01.751
Soon it will be ten years
since I last saw her.

48:02.376 --> 48:04.001
In Barbastro.

48:05.001 --> 48:07.251
- Barbastro your town?
- Yes.

48:08.167 --> 48:09.417
In Aragón.

48:12.251 --> 48:14.501
And your town?
What's it called?

48:15.834 --> 48:17.334
It's gone.

48:17.501 --> 48:18.709
Burnt.

48:20.501 --> 48:21.751
By us?

48:38.501 --> 48:39.834
Here I am.

48:43.709 --> 48:47.709
I just went in my tent
and noticed a strange smell.

48:48.251 --> 48:50.251
Like a dead man.

48:52.417 --> 48:54.501
That's your smell, isn't it?

48:55.292 --> 48:58.001
I don't think so, because I'm alive.

49:03.126 --> 49:04.876
Not for long.

49:10.501 --> 49:12.709
You're not going to kill her, are you?

49:15.709 --> 49:16.709
No.

49:18.001 --> 49:19.501
I like women.

49:41.501 --> 49:43.292
It's Christ, my child.

49:44.459 --> 49:45.626
Christ.

49:47.417 --> 49:48.751
Soldiers...

49:50.042 --> 49:52.751
Our mission is not only
to find the gold.

49:53.042 --> 49:55.626
We also have to convert these savages.

49:57.042 --> 49:58.709
The girl will stay with us

49:59.292 --> 50:01.542
to receive all of God's grace.

50:02.126 --> 50:04.459
Let the fornicators be warned.

50:04.667 --> 50:06.459
Stay away from her.

50:07.167 --> 50:09.626
She now belongs to God, our Lord.

50:09.792 --> 50:12.334
To God and to you, bastard.

50:18.876 --> 50:20.042
Gold.

50:22.417 --> 50:23.626
Mediamano!

50:32.751 --> 50:34.584
She says one day from here

50:34.751 --> 50:37.292
Castilian soldier
who was looking for gold.

50:38.292 --> 50:41.751
It could be a survivor from
Tomás de Ulúa's expedition.

50:41.917 --> 50:45.376
Labastida said on his deathbed
that he was the only survivor.

50:45.501 --> 50:47.042
Maybe he was wrong.

50:47.751 --> 50:48.751
Maybe.

51:13.542 --> 51:16.792
By Christ and the Triana quarter!

51:20.167 --> 51:24.292
This is Juan Tomás de Ulúa's grave.

51:25.542 --> 51:27.292
A good commander.

51:28.167 --> 51:31.501
He tried to lead us
to the City of Gold, but...

51:31.917 --> 51:34.501
fate wanted something else.

51:35.501 --> 51:37.501
How did you survive?

51:38.042 --> 51:43.292
I was so badly hurt that the Caribes
thought I was dead.

51:43.917 --> 51:45.417
When they left,

51:46.417 --> 51:48.042
she saved me.

51:48.876 --> 51:51.167
And these children?
Christians?

51:55.167 --> 51:56.751
They're my children.

51:59.917 --> 52:01.501
That's enough.

52:08.292 --> 52:09.792
Yes, this...

52:10.084 --> 52:11.834
This is the large river.

52:12.042 --> 52:17.042
And two days away, to the north,
the mountain.

52:17.626 --> 52:19.917
Behind it, Tezutlán.

52:20.751 --> 52:22.209
What is this?

52:24.292 --> 52:26.126
It's called the Isle of Women.

52:26.292 --> 52:29.459
An island where no men live,
only women.

52:29.792 --> 52:34.209
Once a year, they bring men
and lie with them.

52:34.751 --> 52:36.334
If they have boys,

52:36.876 --> 52:40.792
they kill them. If they have girls,
they keep them.

52:41.001 --> 52:42.584
They teach them combat.

52:42.751 --> 52:45.501
They're warriors.
They fight ahead of the Indians

52:45.626 --> 52:46.876
as captains.

52:47.084 --> 52:52.501
They say they're very white
and tall and they have very long hair,

52:52.667 --> 52:55.709
braided and tied back
around their heads.

52:55.917 --> 53:01.167
In combat, one of them
is worth ten Indians.

53:05.501 --> 53:06.501
Your face

53:06.626 --> 53:08.042
looks familiar to me.

53:10.417 --> 53:12.584
I'm convinced

53:12.751 --> 53:16.876
that I've coincided with you
somewhere else.

53:17.417 --> 53:18.876
It's possible, I'm an old soldier.

53:19.334 --> 53:21.626
The sack of Rome.

53:22.792 --> 53:24.751
We might have fought together.

53:25.209 --> 53:27.001
On the steps of Saint Peter's Basilica.

53:27.167 --> 53:27.667
Yes.

53:27.834 --> 53:32.584
It was there. We slaughtered
many Swiss guards that day.

53:32.751 --> 53:34.126
Yes, we did.

53:34.292 --> 53:37.001
- And bishops and friars.
- That's right.

53:37.167 --> 53:39.459
- What is your name?
- Bastaurrés.

53:39.751 --> 53:41.459
Sergeant Bastaurrés.

53:43.917 --> 53:45.167
Wait.

53:50.501 --> 53:53.084
This is the royal standard.

53:54.167 --> 53:57.292
Don Tomás de Ulúa defended it

53:57.751 --> 53:59.917
to his last breath.

54:00.876 --> 54:02.334
I'm certain

54:02.501 --> 54:06.501
that you will make better use of it
than me.

54:20.209 --> 54:22.959
Are you sure you don't want
to come with us?

54:23.667 --> 54:26.626
Completely sure, my son.

54:27.042 --> 54:30.751
When she saved my life,
I felt...

54:31.084 --> 54:34.751
that the gods were giving me
another chance.

54:35.417 --> 54:36.751
The gods...

54:37.417 --> 54:38.417
Yes.

54:38.626 --> 54:40.876
I thought you were still Christian.

54:42.292 --> 54:43.417
I am.

54:45.042 --> 54:46.042
But in my own way.

54:48.501 --> 54:50.501
You think this life
is for a Christian?

54:53.751 --> 54:55.542
For this Christian, yes.

54:57.167 --> 55:01.001
I live in peace, I offend no one
and no one offends me.

55:01.167 --> 55:04.417
I command no one
and no one commands me.

55:05.751 --> 55:10.334
I'm an old man simply waiting
for death, nothing more,

55:11.042 --> 55:12.417
nothing less.

55:14.209 --> 55:16.584
Meanwhile, I live here...

55:16.751 --> 55:20.292
with my wife and children.

55:21.001 --> 55:26.667
And my dead companions will always be
here with me in this jungle.

55:29.542 --> 55:30.542
What?

55:30.626 --> 55:31.917
The birds

55:32.417 --> 55:33.626
have returned.

55:37.167 --> 55:39.792
They always leave
when they see soldiers.

55:40.209 --> 55:43.167
They know they only bring tragedy.

55:45.501 --> 55:47.417
No, this one is better.

55:50.459 --> 55:52.417
What words do you draw?

55:52.751 --> 55:54.459
The life of Manuel Requena.

55:55.084 --> 55:59.334
How he came here from Triana
and decided to stay and start a family.

56:18.042 --> 56:19.417
What did she say?

56:20.167 --> 56:22.667
She says that she wants
to have your child.

56:23.126 --> 56:24.126
A child?

56:24.792 --> 56:25.917
With me?

56:27.334 --> 56:28.334
Why?

56:34.001 --> 56:36.709
She says your hand guided by gods.

56:37.376 --> 56:38.376
God...

56:39.334 --> 56:40.542
No.

57:06.501 --> 57:08.084
- Martín.
- What?

57:09.084 --> 57:10.459
Tell me the poem.

57:10.709 --> 57:11.917
What poem?

57:12.126 --> 57:13.917
The bull that goes to the desert.

57:14.084 --> 57:16.251
The bull that goes to the desert.

57:17.084 --> 57:19.626
"Like the bull that flees to the desert

57:19.792 --> 57:22.001
when defeated by his kin,

57:22.334 --> 57:24.209
and waits until his strength returns

57:24.376 --> 57:26.792
to destroy the one
who humiliated him.

57:27.001 --> 57:29.667
Thus must I stay away from thee,

57:30.084 --> 57:33.084
for your face confused my might.

57:33.459 --> 57:36.667
And I must not return
until I am free

57:36.876 --> 57:39.542
of the fear that impedes my delight."

57:43.792 --> 57:47.042
You don't deserve to be baptized,
sinner!

57:47.209 --> 57:48.542
Sinner!

57:50.251 --> 57:51.251
Bastard!

57:57.917 --> 58:00.876
We need God on our side.

58:01.792 --> 58:03.126
Behave yourself.

58:34.209 --> 58:35.459
Good luck.

59:40.501 --> 59:43.167
He's been leaving signals
for Medrano.

59:48.334 --> 59:50.414
They burnt down the village,
they're right behind us.

59:53.917 --> 59:55.517
They don't know how many
of us there are.

59:55.626 --> 59:56.626
So?

59:57.292 --> 59:59.459
- Give me some men.
- What for?

01:00:00.167 --> 01:00:02.626
To be the dogs
who scatter the hares.

01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:04.792
Take Iturbe and four more.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.209
I'll need the lady as well.

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:09.459
Why?

01:00:10.459 --> 01:00:13.042
Soldiers are distracted
by a beautiful woman.

01:00:13.917 --> 01:00:15.417
That's very true.

01:00:15.751 --> 01:00:17.917
If the lady accepts.

01:00:19.751 --> 01:00:20.751
All right.

01:00:23.501 --> 01:00:24.876
But I want a weapon.

01:00:36.292 --> 01:00:38.167
You're now prisoners of the king.

01:00:39.751 --> 01:00:41.251
- Who's in charge?
- I am.

01:00:42.209 --> 01:00:43.417
Who are you?

01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:46.459
Martín Dávila, king's soldier
and acting sergeant.

01:00:49.501 --> 01:00:51.042
And the rest of the expedition?

01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:53.709
Dead.

01:00:54.959 --> 01:00:56.667
Slit all of their throats.

01:00:57.334 --> 01:00:59.501
Should we kill the woman too?

01:00:59.626 --> 01:01:01.209
No, not her.

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:04.251
She's a widow and needs
to be consoled.

01:02:31.584 --> 01:02:33.334
What should we do with them?

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.292
My opinion is those who want
to come with us, let them.

01:02:37.459 --> 01:02:40.542
Those who don't can leave
and try to reach Puerto Cristo.

01:02:41.084 --> 01:02:44.376
If any of them stay,
we'll have to share the gold with them.

01:02:45.376 --> 01:02:47.917
They're companions in arms
who were obeying orders.

01:02:48.084 --> 01:02:50.501
Any one of us could be
in their situation.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:54.334
They also wanted to slit our throats
and take our gold.

01:02:57.251 --> 01:02:58.876
They fought well.

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:02.334
- They deserve to die well.
- Sir.

01:03:03.792 --> 01:03:05.792
There's enough gold for everyone.

01:03:06.334 --> 01:03:09.334
I think we could use
a few more soldiers.

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:18.209
All right.

01:03:18.584 --> 01:03:19.584
It shall be done.

01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:24.209
Those who want to join us,
step forward.

01:03:24.542 --> 01:03:27.126
Those who want to return
to Puerto Cristo,

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:29.209
leave.

01:03:38.209 --> 01:03:39.042
Name?

01:03:39.209 --> 01:03:40.542
Juan Alonso.

01:03:41.126 --> 01:03:42.459
From León.

01:03:48.876 --> 01:03:50.459
Do you remember me?

01:04:03.001 --> 01:04:05.917
He won't be consoling
any more widows.

01:04:12.001 --> 01:04:15.417
<i>Under Gorriamendi's orders
and with the consent of all the soldiers,</i>

01:04:15.542 --> 01:04:17.376
<i>in order to shorten the path
to the gold,</i>

01:04:17.501 --> 01:04:20.667
<i>we entered territory
belonging to Indian archers.</i>

01:04:20.876 --> 01:04:24.876
<i>Indians Labastida's map called
"The Three Sin Savages.“</i>

01:04:25.084 --> 01:04:29.001
<i>They don't believe in God,
they're sodomites and they eat human flesh.</i>

01:04:29.334 --> 01:04:33.334
<i>May God, our crossbows
and our arquebuses protect us.</i>

01:05:07.459 --> 01:05:09.084
Listen, soldiers.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:21.917
Young Pedro,

01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:23.792
Roncal, Castro.

01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:27.542
You'll go ahead to scout the terrain.

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.667
You're from Trujillo, right?

01:05:37.584 --> 01:05:40.334
If I don't come back,
my share of the gold goes to you.

01:05:40.584 --> 01:05:42.459
On the condition

01:05:42.667 --> 01:05:46.667
that when you go back to Spain,
you go to Zafra and give it to my mother.

01:05:48.459 --> 01:05:50.876
If my mother has died,
you can keep it.

01:05:56.251 --> 01:05:57.334
Here.

01:06:08.542 --> 01:06:10.251
If they attack you,

01:06:12.334 --> 01:06:14.792
try not to be taken alive.

01:06:48.334 --> 01:06:51.167
Despite the grudges, ambition
and disputes,

01:06:51.542 --> 01:06:54.542
and that we were killing each other
when there was no enemy,

01:06:55.251 --> 01:06:58.126
we were soldiers,
comrades in arms.

01:06:58.626 --> 01:07:01.667
<i>Singular ties and reason enough
to not abandon Castro,</i>

01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:03.501
<i>Roncal and young Pedro.</i>

01:07:04.292 --> 01:07:06.501
<i>And though we were certain
of their torment and demise,</i>

01:07:06.626 --> 01:07:08.959
<i>we decided to find them, bury them</i>

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:10.626
<i>and avenge them.</i>

01:07:43.251 --> 01:07:44.876
How far away are they?

01:07:45.042 --> 01:07:47.501
Not far away. They're here.

01:07:49.292 --> 01:07:50.292
Take cover!

01:07:55.209 --> 01:07:56.542
Hold on!

01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:11.917
Why are they waiting
to attack us?

01:08:13.376 --> 01:08:15.709
For fear of poison arrows

01:08:15.917 --> 01:08:18.876
to enter hearts of your soldiers.

01:08:39.001 --> 01:08:40.251
Sing.

01:08:44.501 --> 01:08:45.584
Sing.

01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:49.126
<i>Mother...</i>

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:55.917
<i>Mother, I come from the poplar trees.</i>

01:08:56.876 --> 01:09:01.584
<i>I saw them shaking in the breeze.</i>

01:09:02.376 --> 01:09:07.626
<i>The poplars in Seville where</i>

01:09:08.167 --> 01:09:12.709
<i>I saw my friend so fair.</i>

01:09:13.251 --> 01:09:18.126
<i>Mother, I come from the poplar trees.</i>

01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:23.126
<i>I saw them shaking in the breeze.</i>

01:09:23.501 --> 01:09:28.126
<i>The poplars in Seville where</i>

01:09:28.626 --> 01:09:32.709
<i>I saw my friend so fair.</i>

01:09:33.251 --> 01:09:37.709
<i>Mother, I come from the poplar trees.</i>

01:09:38.501 --> 01:09:42.501
<i>I saw them shaking in the breeze.</i>

01:09:42.876 --> 01:09:47.417
<i>The poplars in Seville where</i>

01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:51.834
<i>I saw my friend so fair.</i>

01:09:57.751 --> 01:09:59.417
Are they gone?

01:10:00.001 --> 01:10:01.001
Yes.

01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:04.626
Now they know the soldiers
will fight.

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:07.167
They'll return to village.

01:10:07.417 --> 01:10:09.501
To defend women and children.

01:10:10.584 --> 01:10:12.251
And how do they fight?

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.501
They like to deceive.

01:11:28.376 --> 01:11:29.376
Take cover!

01:11:29.459 --> 01:11:30.459
Quickly!

01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:52.209
If we don't get out of here,

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:54.959
they'll kill us one by one.

01:11:55.917 --> 01:11:58.084
How many arquebuses have we got?

01:11:58.501 --> 01:11:59.834
Six.

01:12:44.251 --> 01:12:45.626
The fence is moving.

01:12:46.501 --> 01:12:48.167
Remain calm, gentlemen.

01:12:48.876 --> 01:12:51.126
We're the emperor's soldiers.

01:12:58.876 --> 01:12:59.876
Fire.

01:13:04.876 --> 01:13:05.876
Fire.

01:13:06.376 --> 01:13:07.417
Now!

01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:15.709
Iturbe, Barbate,

01:14:16.876 --> 01:14:20.584
find the women and children.

01:14:47.001 --> 01:14:48.042
Stop.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:15:00.251
They were hiding in a well
under one of the huts.

01:15:00.501 --> 01:15:03.709
Kill them all, in the name of God!

01:15:11.084 --> 01:15:12.751
What are you doing, Martín?

01:15:13.084 --> 01:15:14.084
No.

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:15.501
What do you mean, no?

01:15:16.876 --> 01:15:18.542
Get out of the way

01:15:18.959 --> 01:15:20.876
or I'll kill you right now.

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.542
Damn Indian bastard!

01:15:37.209 --> 01:15:38.209
He was only an Indian.

01:15:53.667 --> 01:15:55.917
It's time for us to leave this place.

01:16:12.876 --> 01:16:16.584
<i>After great difficulties we have left
the land of Three Sins,</i>

01:16:16.751 --> 01:16:19.334
<i>where we left young Pedro,
Castilian;</i>

01:16:19.501 --> 01:16:21.542
<i>Roncal, Navarran;
Castro, Extremaduran;</i>

01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:23.917
<i>Salas, Aragonese;
Zabala, Navarran;</i>

01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:26.417
<i>Joao, Portuguese;
Panizo, Extremaduran;</i>

01:16:26.542 --> 01:16:30.626
<i>Areta, Carvajal and five who recently
joined us, all Andalusians.</i>

01:16:31.167 --> 01:16:34.501
<i>Our Indian guide was also killed,
who we knew as Mediamano,</i>

01:16:34.667 --> 01:16:38.001
<i>but whose real name was Chima,
from the Chocóe tribe.</i>

01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:41.709
<i>He taught me words of his pretty
language and customs of his race.</i>

01:16:42.876 --> 01:16:44.501
May he rest in peace.

01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:04.459
Will the emperor read
what you're writing?

01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:06.167
I hope so.

01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:09.167
Am I in it?

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.042
Do you know how to read?

01:17:13.626 --> 01:17:14.751
A little.

01:17:18.876 --> 01:17:19.917
Look.

01:17:24.667 --> 01:17:25.667
Here.

01:17:29.167 --> 01:17:33.042
"Don Gonzalo...

01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:38.167
de Baztán...

01:17:39.334 --> 01:17:44.501
accompanied...

01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:52.292
by his servant,

01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:54.959
Marchena."

01:17:58.042 --> 01:17:59.667
When we find the gold,

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:02.376
I'm not going back to Spain,
I'm staying here.

01:18:02.501 --> 01:18:03.501
Why?

01:18:03.792 --> 01:18:06.001
Because if the emperor of Spain
reads that,

01:18:06.167 --> 01:18:07.584
everyone will know I'm a servant.

01:18:07.751 --> 01:18:11.417
And if I stay here, everyone will know me
as Don Diego de Marchena.

01:18:12.042 --> 01:18:14.876
Then you have to learn
to read and write well.

01:18:16.209 --> 01:18:17.209
Okay.

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.251
<i>May 28th.</i>

01:20:09.084 --> 01:20:11.084
<i>The day God abandoned us,</i>

01:20:11.626 --> 01:20:13.917
<i>or to be exact,
abandoned the last man</i>

01:20:14.126 --> 01:20:15.917
<i>to have Him at his side.</i>

01:20:33.459 --> 01:20:35.792
The priest fell in the swamp!

01:20:44.959 --> 01:20:48.001
He was relieving himself
and he fell.

01:21:12.251 --> 01:21:14.251
I would have liked
to have killed him myself.

01:21:15.667 --> 01:21:17.501
My father was a priest.

01:21:33.626 --> 01:21:35.334
Stay on the lookout.

01:21:35.751 --> 01:21:36.792
For what?

01:21:37.084 --> 01:21:39.334
Gorriamendi and his men.

01:21:40.209 --> 01:21:43.626
They'll take advantage
of any slip-up to kill us.

01:21:45.626 --> 01:21:48.876
They can smell the gold
and they don't want to share it.

01:21:49.542 --> 01:21:52.501
Before they attack us,
they'll separate us.

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.626
Who is with us?

01:21:57.917 --> 01:21:59.667
Us three.

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:03.751
And the new guy?

01:22:06.626 --> 01:22:08.292
Maybe Iturbe.

01:22:10.876 --> 01:22:12.751
They won't want any witnesses.

01:22:13.167 --> 01:22:14.626
Stay alert.

01:22:16.751 --> 01:22:19.751
We're half a league away
from the large river.

01:22:21.042 --> 01:22:22.501
In that direction.

01:22:26.292 --> 01:22:28.209
Martín Dávila, Barbate.

01:22:29.042 --> 01:22:31.501
Go ahead to scout the terrain.

01:22:32.001 --> 01:22:33.292
Let's go!

01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:09.751
What are you doing, Lieutenant?

01:23:10.501 --> 01:23:11.584
Killing you.

01:23:11.834 --> 01:23:13.501
I'm the king's representative.

01:23:13.917 --> 01:23:15.209
For exactly that reason.

01:23:15.376 --> 01:23:17.667
Or did you think I was going
to share the gold with him?

01:23:21.834 --> 01:23:23.376
He doesn't deserve it.

01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:24.626
Son of a bitch!

01:24:23.251 --> 01:24:24.751
Bitch!

01:24:39.834 --> 01:24:41.501
The gold isn't only yours.

01:24:42.001 --> 01:24:45.001
This will hurt me
more than you, soldier.

01:26:40.334 --> 01:26:42.709
<i>This military tribunal
composed of myself</i>

01:26:42.876 --> 01:26:44.459
as troop leader,

01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:47.126
acting sergeant Martín Dávila,

01:26:47.292 --> 01:26:50.501
and the soldiers known as
Iturbe and Barbate,

01:26:50.792 --> 01:26:56.501
have decided to sentence Lieutenant
Juan de Gorriamendi to death for mutiny...

01:26:58.167 --> 01:26:59.417
and treason.

01:27:00.292 --> 01:27:03.751
Marchena the executioner will carry out
the sentence in the king's name.

01:27:03.917 --> 01:27:05.292
I'm not an executioner anymore.

01:27:05.501 --> 01:27:08.417
Kill me yourself.
Soldier to soldier.

01:27:10.417 --> 01:27:13.042
Untie me, I want to cross myself.

01:27:13.542 --> 01:27:14.751
By your word?

01:27:15.626 --> 01:27:16.626
By my word.

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.251
Hurry up, Lorenzo.

01:27:30.459 --> 01:27:32.376
I've never liked waiting.

01:28:15.042 --> 01:28:17.292
You're the one who writes now,
right?

01:28:18.751 --> 01:28:21.251
Put that I'm not an executioner
anymore.

01:28:22.876 --> 01:28:24.584
We're going to cross the river.

01:28:24.876 --> 01:28:26.626
Let's not waste time.

01:28:41.501 --> 01:28:43.251
<i>June 1st.</i>

01:28:43.834 --> 01:28:47.042
<i>I'm writing what will
most certainly be my last lines.</i>

01:28:47.792 --> 01:28:51.792
<i>I've passed my notes onto soldier
Martín Dávila, native of Trujillo,</i>

01:28:52.251 --> 01:28:56.542
<i>for him to deliver with the agreed amount
of gold to our king the emperor.</i>

01:28:57.209 --> 01:29:00.001
<i>I chose him because he's from
Extremadura, a frontier man,</i>

01:29:00.167 --> 01:29:03.001
<i>filled with the spirit of discovery,
just like Cortés.</i>

01:29:03.501 --> 01:29:07.667
<i>If my writings reach the right hands
and bring me fame, I welcome it.</i>

01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:10.751
<i>If the creator has other intentions,</i>

01:29:11.542 --> 01:29:15.001
<i>then I will pass like a withered flower
with no fame at all.</i>

01:29:16.209 --> 01:29:18.209
<i>My fame will disappear in the land.</i>

01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:40.792
Two Indian tribes fighting each other,
there are a lot of them.

01:29:46.584 --> 01:29:48.042
Hide.

01:31:02.084 --> 01:31:03.626
Stop, stop.

01:31:19.834 --> 01:31:22.084
Now I order you to leave me here.

01:31:23.334 --> 01:31:26.542
I can't keep up,
I'm holding you back.

01:31:27.501 --> 01:31:29.334
The gold is near.

01:31:31.209 --> 01:31:32.542
You need to find it.

01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:34.751
Without it, you're dead men.

01:31:34.959 --> 01:31:36.751
You'll be hanged.

01:31:46.792 --> 01:31:49.042
Now it's your turn to carry it.

01:32:04.292 --> 01:32:05.542
Martín...

01:32:06.959 --> 01:32:09.501
Don't let the gold drive you mad.

01:32:10.126 --> 01:32:12.334
Give the king his fifth.

01:32:12.792 --> 01:32:15.042
That way all will be forgiven.

01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:17.167
Everything.

01:32:25.251 --> 01:32:26.334
No.

01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:30.709
I believe in another life.

01:32:33.334 --> 01:32:35.251
You want me to do it?

01:32:38.001 --> 01:32:39.709
It's not worth it.

01:32:41.459 --> 01:32:42.626
It's almost over.

01:33:15.417 --> 01:33:16.751
I smell the sea.

01:33:41.042 --> 01:33:42.292
Gold.

01:33:50.084 --> 01:33:51.084
<i>Today,</i>

01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:53.917
<i>the 4th of June,</i>

01:33:54.417 --> 01:33:56.334
<i>we arrived at Tezutlán.</i>

01:33:58.584 --> 01:34:00.751
<i>For 62 days</i>

01:34:01.501 --> 01:34:03.709
<i>we crossed the cruel jungle,</i>

01:34:03.917 --> 01:34:06.626
<i>mocked and ridiculed by fortune.</i>

01:34:07.417 --> 01:34:11.042
<i>We fought mercilessly against
the natives of these lands</i>

01:34:12.417 --> 01:34:14.292
<i>and we killed each other,</i>

01:34:14.459 --> 01:34:16.292
<i>blinded by the gold.</i>

01:34:16.792 --> 01:34:21.209
<i>Before finalizing our memoirs
as requested by the scribe Ulzama,</i>

01:34:21.376 --> 01:34:25.417
<i>I've decided that, just like Asia
and Europe were given names of women,</i>

01:34:25.542 --> 01:34:28.334
<i>that the peaks from which
we spotted Tezutlán</i>

01:34:28.501 --> 01:34:30.417
<i>will be known from now on</i>

01:34:30.667 --> 01:34:32.501
<i>as the Doña Ana Mountain.</i>

01:34:53.917 --> 01:34:57.251
<i>I also leave record
that on the 8th of April</i>

01:34:57.417 --> 01:35:00.334
<i>forty men and women
left Puerto Cristo.</i>

01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:02.709
<i>Today, only two of us remain.</i>

01:35:02.876 --> 01:35:04.126
There was no gold.

01:35:07.667 --> 01:35:10.417
It's fucking glazed mud.

01:35:12.084 --> 01:35:14.084
Like pottery from Andujar.

01:35:15.626 --> 01:35:16.626
Right.

01:35:17.917 --> 01:35:19.042
Martín.

01:35:20.792 --> 01:35:22.751
Everything we did...

01:35:24.751 --> 01:35:26.459
was for nothing.

01:35:39.292 --> 01:35:40.376
They say

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:43.126
across this sea there's a place
some call China

01:35:44.292 --> 01:35:46.084
and others Catay.

01:35:47.042 --> 01:35:49.834
And that it's the route
of silk and pearls.

01:35:55.626 --> 01:35:58.084
It's much bigger
than the one in Barbate.

01:35:59.667 --> 01:36:01.167
And it's ours.

01:36:26.292 --> 01:36:28.876
<i>I, Martín Dávila,</i>

01:36:29.459 --> 01:36:31.042
<i>native of Trujillo,</i>

01:36:31.167 --> 01:36:33.501
<i>soldier and discoverer,</i>

01:36:33.917 --> 01:36:37.917
<i>take possession of this
sea ocean and its shores</i>

01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:40.292
<i>in the name of Carlos the Emperor,</i>

01:36:40.501 --> 01:36:44.126
<i>king of the world
and the lands of Spain.</i>

01:36:50.584 --> 01:36:54.459
For Pepe Salcedo, teacher and friend.

01:36:54.959 --> 01:36:58.876
GOLD

01:36:59.305 --> 01:37:05.194
