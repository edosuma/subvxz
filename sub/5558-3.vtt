08:56.709 --> 08:58.125

Hi, I was wondering

08:58.125 --> 08:59.291
if you and your family
had five minutes

08:59.291 --> 09:00.667
to talk about the dangers
of factory farms.

09:00.667 --> 09:01.583
I'm really busy.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.750
It'll just take five minutes.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.959
Could you stretch
that out to ten?

09:04.959 --> 09:06.041
Oh, I got a whole hour
of material.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.375
Come on in, sister,

09:07.375 --> 09:08.667
-let's go.
-Really?

09:08.667 --> 09:10.166
This never happens.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.834
HEATHER: Okay,
for the next ten minutes

09:11.834 --> 09:13.625
you three are going
to sit here quietly

09:13.625 --> 09:14.959
and listen to...

09:14.959 --> 09:17.375
Kalliope.

09:17.375 --> 09:18.792
Kalliope.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.417
Did you...
did you choose that name?

09:20.417 --> 09:23.041
Yes, I got to,
on my 18th birthday, so...

09:23.041 --> 09:24.417
That's lovely.

09:24.417 --> 09:27.291
I am going to send
one e-mail. Okay?

09:27.291 --> 09:30.208
The only reason that you have
permission to call my name

09:30.208 --> 09:32.083
is if one of you is bleeding.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.000
Okay?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.291
I'm talking...

09:34.291 --> 09:35.667

09:35.667 --> 09:37.083
I-I'm talking like...

09:37.083 --> 09:38.750

09:38.750 --> 09:39.875

09:39.875 --> 09:41.250

So...speaking of bleeding,

09:49.000 --> 09:50.875

ever lived in a cage

09:50.875 --> 09:51.917

09:51.917 --> 09:54.041

in a Murphy bed.

09:54.041 --> 09:56.709
