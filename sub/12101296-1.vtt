WEBVTT

00:06.260 --> 00:07.603
Welcome to the show.

00:07.603 --> 00:09.158
Today, we're going to be playing two hours

00:09.158 --> 00:11.121
of the music with Brian Corner

00:11.121 --> 00:12.559
on the anniversary of his death.

00:12.559 --> 00:14.620
We're gonna start the show
off today with the music

00:14.620 --> 00:17.219
from the Arthur Fisher
film that never got made.

00:25.537 --> 00:30.537
she draws real good

00:31.945 --> 00:36.945
as a young Clint Eastwood

00:38.624 --> 00:43.624
he writes great songs

00:44.901 --> 00:49.901
he never sends them out

00:51.823 --> 00:56.823
he writes like Capote

00:58.318 --> 01:03.318
the words that he wrote, yeah

01:05.041 --> 01:10.041
photos like Cartier-Bresson

01:18.206 --> 01:21.604
middle of the night to say

01:24.707 --> 01:28.052
middle of the night to say

01:30.471 --> 01:33.721
- Dorothy, sweetheart, come here a sec.

01:46.826 --> 01:48.326
- Look over these.

01:50.496 --> 01:53.996
These two pictures are of the same person.

01:58.215 --> 01:59.838
- I can't really tell.

01:59.838 --> 02:02.949
It's blurry and it's of his back.

02:02.949 --> 02:05.331
He's got a hat and glasses in that one.

02:05.331 --> 02:06.610
Who is it?

02:06.610 --> 02:09.670
- Brian Corner. Musician from the '80s.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.331
- Never heard of him.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.556
- Well, you haven't heard of anyone.

02:13.556 --> 02:15.501
- That's 'cause I'm not
obsessed with fame, like some.

02:15.501 --> 02:19.159
- I'm not obsessed with fame.
It's just curious, you know.

02:19.159 --> 02:20.501
He fell off the face of the earth

02:20.501 --> 02:23.201
when he was about to hit the big time.

02:23.201 --> 02:24.534
Supposedly died.

02:25.539 --> 02:27.082
He just went missing.

02:27.082 --> 02:29.071
He's like a cult artist now.

02:29.071 --> 02:31.289
I think I heard the story.

02:31.289 --> 02:34.039
- He took a boat out to sea, but,

02:35.232 --> 02:36.649
he just was gone.

02:37.987 --> 02:39.654
- Hmm. Sounds fishy.

02:44.203 --> 02:46.579
- You know, they found a boat.

02:46.579 --> 02:48.041
It was not him.

02:48.041 --> 02:48.874
- Suicide?

02:49.759 --> 02:50.980
- Well, why would he do that?

02:50.980 --> 02:54.255
I mean, just throw himself off a bridge

02:54.255 --> 02:55.927
or eat cyanide or something?

02:55.927 --> 02:57.549
- Many people have their
own reasons for doing

02:57.549 --> 02:59.557
what they do when they kill themselves.

02:59.557 --> 03:01.388
Can't always make sense of it.

03:01.388 --> 03:03.685
- No, it was just too easy.

03:03.685 --> 03:05.854
If there's no body, there's no death.

03:05.854 --> 03:10.166
- It's not unusual to not find
a body, especially at sea.

03:10.166 --> 03:13.865
- Yeah, but the idea that he was suicidal,

03:13.865 --> 03:17.376
and a heroin addict,
it's complete bollocks.

03:17.376 --> 03:19.615
- Was there a suicide note?

03:19.615 --> 03:22.308
- No, it's too obvious.

03:22.308 --> 03:23.558
- Or the truth?

03:24.464 --> 03:26.394
He woulda turned up by
now if it was a hoax.

03:26.394 --> 03:29.770
People are always looking
for a hoax or conspiracy.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.253
And he would've needed help.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.488
- Yeah, and he's had a lotta help,

03:32.488 --> 03:34.006
and he's got away with it for a long time.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.667
But I'm telling you, I'm
gonna get him this time.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.667
David Watford's spot on.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.130
- So what if he is alive?

03:41.130 --> 03:44.463
If he wants to be dead, let him be dead.

03:47.364 --> 03:50.602
- If I sell these, when I sell these,

03:50.602 --> 03:51.769
tell you what,

03:54.028 --> 03:56.084
we could go anywhere in the world.

03:56.084 --> 03:57.721
Where'd you wanna go?

03:57.721 --> 04:00.063
- I'm going to the
kitchen and do the dishes.

04:00.063 --> 04:01.230
- Oh, come on.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.567
Live it up. Come on.

04:14.202 --> 04:15.312
Apparently Nevada has more

04:15.312 --> 04:18.564
Brian Corner sightings
than any other US state.

04:18.564 --> 04:20.718
I'm not sure how they
measure these things.

04:20.718 --> 04:24.879
Sometimes I think
someone's pulling my leg.

04:24.879 --> 04:26.319
Arthur Fisher's "Ticket to the Bridge"

04:26.319 --> 04:28.493
wasn't made for various reasons.

04:28.493 --> 04:31.119
The only thing that
still exists in reality

04:31.119 --> 04:33.536
is Brian Corner's soundtrack.

04:54.179 --> 04:55.118
- Good evening, folks.

04:55.118 --> 04:58.398
My guest this evening is David Watford,

04:58.398 --> 04:59.335
who was good enough to send me

04:59.335 --> 05:02.354
an advance copy of his book, "Cornered."

05:02.354 --> 05:05.024
So let's turn to our guest this evening.

05:05.024 --> 05:07.249
That's a pretty big claim
you're making in your book,

05:07.249 --> 05:09.691
which I read, and did not enjoy.

05:09.691 --> 05:11.927
- Really? Well, you're one of a very few.

05:11.927 --> 05:13.563
- Oh, well, it doesn't
take away from the fact

05:13.563 --> 05:17.064
that Corner's is a
pretty low-hanging fruit.

05:17.064 --> 05:18.845
- What was it that you
didn't like about it?

05:18.845 --> 05:21.657
The premise is that
Brian Corner's still alive.

05:21.657 --> 05:23.568
- Well, only time will tell.

05:23.568 --> 05:24.973
But it's been a long time.

05:24.973 --> 05:26.613
Are you hoping this book will prompt him

05:26.613 --> 05:27.594
to come out of hiding?

05:27.594 --> 05:29.272
- Well, maybe, but I actually think

05:29.272 --> 05:31.733
it will push him deeper into hiding.

05:31.733 --> 05:35.088
- Look, it's been 25
years since he's died.

05:35.088 --> 05:36.126
- Uh, disappearance.

05:36.126 --> 05:37.347
- OK, disappeared, if you must.

05:37.347 --> 05:38.766
Thank you.

05:38.766 --> 05:42.003
- Why not leave him alone? Why
do you want to unearth him?

05:42.003 --> 05:43.663
- Well, 'cause there's an interest.

05:43.663 --> 05:46.282
- So what? Is it worthy?

05:46.282 --> 05:49.483
- Well, you know, I like a
good story, a good mystery.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.862
And worthiness is relative.

05:51.862 --> 05:53.424
This is Brian Corner's story.

05:53.424 --> 05:56.186
I think he set up his disappearance.

05:56.186 --> 06:00.737
- So it's like a Madeleine
McCann meets Harry Houdini?

06:00.737 --> 06:02.978
- You know, he's a complicated man.

06:02.978 --> 06:05.503
Maybe he can explain
everything when he reappears.

06:05.503 --> 06:08.578
- He might've died in the 25
years that he's been hiding.

06:08.578 --> 06:11.657
- Yeah, that's possible,
but he was very healthy.

06:11.657 --> 06:13.081
- Wasn't he a heroin addict?

06:13.081 --> 06:14.081
- Debatable.

06:15.225 --> 06:17.844
- What would you like to see happen

06:17.844 --> 06:19.523
if he comes out of hiding?

06:19.523 --> 06:24.098
- D'you know what, I'd like
him to create another album.

06:24.098 --> 06:26.092
I think maybe he could've
been making music

06:26.092 --> 06:28.350
for the whole 25 years.

06:28.350 --> 06:30.411
- Do you really think that's gonna happen?

06:30.411 --> 06:33.433
See, I'm not buying it.
That's wishful thinking.

06:33.433 --> 06:36.371
- Well, yes, it's what I
would like to see happen,

06:36.371 --> 06:38.633
'cause I'm a massive fan.

06:38.633 --> 06:40.697
- Look, he probably looks a lot different.

06:40.697 --> 06:41.791
He probably sounds a lot different.

06:41.791 --> 06:43.471
His voice has surely matured.

06:43.471 --> 06:46.524
He would have a completely
different sound.

06:46.524 --> 06:49.024
- If he's reinvented
himself, all the better.

06:49.024 --> 06:50.465
- You might not approve
of what he's become.

06:50.465 --> 06:53.825
- You know, I'm open to change.

06:53.825 --> 06:56.844
- Where would he be
hiding, if he's hiding?

06:56.844 --> 06:59.889
- He could be right under our very noses.

06:59.889 --> 07:03.671
Or he could be living in
a log cabin somewhere.

07:03.671 --> 07:05.868
- My guess is that he's died,

07:05.868 --> 07:09.628
and you are milking the public
that thrive on conspiracies.

07:09.628 --> 07:11.708
- Well, now, you can think
what you wanna think,

07:11.708 --> 07:14.391
but only time can tell.

07:14.391 --> 07:16.308
When "Cornered" hits the shelves,

07:16.308 --> 07:18.049
where can the public buy it?

07:18.049 --> 07:21.431
- So "Cornered" hits the shelves tomorrow,

07:21.431 --> 07:22.361
and the public can buy it

07:22.361 --> 07:25.759
in any respectable bookshop and online.

07:25.759 --> 07:28.457
- D'you think Brian Corner
will be purchasing a copy?

07:28.457 --> 07:30.019
If he's still around, that is?

07:30.019 --> 07:33.675
- Well, you know, he may be
living in solitude somewhere,

07:33.675 --> 07:34.860
and never know that the book is there.

07:34.860 --> 07:37.997
But if he does know, I think he'll buy it,

07:37.997 --> 07:41.158
I think he'll read it,
and I think he'll enjoy

07:41.158 --> 07:44.621
reading about the mystery that he set up.

08:37.374 --> 08:38.781
- I just don't like the thought of someone

08:38.781 --> 08:41.798
capitalizing on someone else's debt.

08:41.798 --> 08:43.997
It don't sit right with me, all right?

08:43.997 --> 08:47.382
I mean, I know all the rumors.
All the conspiracy theories.

08:47.382 --> 08:49.782
"Oh, Brian Corner's still alive!"

08:49.782 --> 08:52.001
All that old bollocks.

08:52.001 --> 08:53.251
It's not right.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.100
He'd blow his bloody head off.

08:58.490 --> 09:01.409
- Well, you'll always
get that sort of thing.

09:01.409 --> 09:05.530
It happened with Elvis,
Michael Jackson, Cobain.

09:05.530 --> 09:09.792
You know, that fellow
that blew his brains out.

09:09.792 --> 09:11.253
There will always be conspiracies.

09:11.253 --> 09:14.880
- Don't make it right, though, does it?

09:14.880 --> 09:17.213
- Don't worry about it then.

09:18.061 --> 09:20.733
- So I want to send a
message to these people.

09:20.733 --> 09:22.162
Teach 'em not to spread lies.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.042
- How do you know it's a lie?

09:24.042 --> 09:25.173
Maybe it's the truth.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.600
- Oh, bollocks.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.893
He's paid people to change
their stories, hasn't he?

09:29.893 --> 09:31.111
He's just a hack job.

09:31.111 --> 09:34.392
Just to sell his book and
make some bloody money.

09:34.392 --> 09:37.493
- You can't blame people for making money.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.602
Are they hurting anyone by doing it?

09:40.602 --> 09:41.602
And besides,

09:43.431 --> 09:44.848
maybe it is true.

09:47.181 --> 09:49.600
- So you believe it then, do ya?

09:49.600 --> 09:52.272
- I don't know Brian
Corner like you do, so.

09:52.272 --> 09:54.032
- Will you just listen to yourself?

09:54.032 --> 09:56.519
You're talking like he's still alive.

09:56.519 --> 09:58.930
He's dead, mate, all right, yeah?

09:58.930 --> 10:01.427
He died 25 years ago.

10:01.427 --> 10:03.211
- That's what they say.

10:03.211 --> 10:06.896
I'm not so sure after reading that book.

10:06.896 --> 10:09.811
- You're unfuckingbelievable,
you know that?

10:09.811 --> 10:12.168
You actually believe it, don't you?

10:12.168 --> 10:14.749
- Listen, I don't know what I believe.

10:14.749 --> 10:17.448
It's just a story for me.

10:17.448 --> 10:19.804
I'm not invested in the
man like you are, so.

10:19.804 --> 10:21.522
I didn't know him like you did.

10:21.522 --> 10:23.506
So what do you want me to believe?

10:23.506 --> 10:27.164
I only read the book
because you gave it to me.

10:27.164 --> 10:30.831
- You people. You're
so gullible, aren't ya?

10:32.023 --> 10:33.440
- Listen, listen.

10:35.799 --> 10:40.799
Whether you like it or not,
people like good conspiracies.

10:41.276 --> 10:44.039
People believe Jesus
Christ died on the cross

10:44.039 --> 10:45.639
and he came back to life.

10:45.639 --> 10:47.383
Why is it so hard for you to believe

10:47.383 --> 10:49.783
that the man faked his own death?

10:49.783 --> 10:53.033
- I think you need to chill out. Check.

10:57.781 --> 10:59.602
- I'm a realist, mate.

10:59.602 --> 11:02.940
I don't buy into other people's bullshit.

11:02.940 --> 11:05.580
- Yeah? So what are you
going to do about it?

11:05.580 --> 11:06.903
- You'll see.

11:06.903 --> 11:08.738
And what is that?

11:08.738 --> 11:10.151
- I said

11:10.151 --> 11:11.068
you'll see.

11:15.733 --> 11:17.400
- He's a nutter, no?

11:18.882 --> 11:20.802
- He's going to kill someone.

11:20.802 --> 11:22.240
Maybe you should inform the police.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.121
- No, he's harmless.

11:24.121 --> 11:25.811
He always has a bee in his bonnet

11:25.811 --> 11:27.285
about one thing or another.

11:27.285 --> 11:28.325
We are
celebrating the music

11:28.325 --> 11:30.165
of Brian Corner today.

11:30.165 --> 11:31.602
We are taking requests and playing

11:31.602 --> 11:34.379
the Brian Corner songs
you want to hear the most.

11:34.379 --> 11:36.725
The hits and the obscure.

12:14.035 --> 12:15.035
- Brian! Hi.

12:17.496 --> 12:18.871
I am such a massive fan.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.592
I've seen you live three times.

12:23.111 --> 12:24.028
Are you OK?

12:26.014 --> 12:27.311
It's like I'm in some sort of dream.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.238
I was just coming over the bridge,

12:28.238 --> 12:32.238
and I saw you standing
here, and I was like, ah!

12:33.379 --> 12:36.760
Oh, will you signed something for me?

12:42.558 --> 12:44.641
Hold on, lemme get a pen.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.110
Oh, my name is Chloe.

12:51.198 --> 12:54.281
You could just write something sweet.

13:07.617 --> 13:09.367
Oh my God, are you...

13:11.799 --> 13:14.264
Did you write me a song?

13:14.264 --> 13:17.154
Ah, I feel like I'm in some sort of dream.

13:17.154 --> 13:20.910
Oh, and thank you. Um, wait, hold on!

13:20.910 --> 13:21.744
That was a little snippet

13:21.744 --> 13:23.457
of the devil of "Chloe's Song,"

13:23.457 --> 13:25.275
discovered among Brian's belongings

13:25.275 --> 13:27.457
in the loft of his family home.

13:27.457 --> 13:31.084
"Chloe's Song" went number
nine in the charts in 1990.

13:48.377 --> 13:52.579
women, and he's inside

14:05.555 --> 14:09.519
and I used to flirt

14:15.706 --> 14:20.706
married in the morning

14:27.102 --> 14:31.522
up alone and hungover

14:31.522 --> 14:36.522
wearing for the groom

14:53.560 --> 14:55.282
- I've been thinking.

14:55.282 --> 14:58.723
I've been thinking about
this Brian Corner fella.

14:58.723 --> 15:01.000
So I decided to read the book

15:01.000 --> 15:02.621
that sent you on this wild goose chase,

15:02.621 --> 15:06.125
and looked at the pictures again.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.208
And, well, I,

15:09.632 --> 15:11.222
I think you're wasting your time.

15:11.222 --> 15:13.031
It's not the same guy.

15:13.031 --> 15:16.913
- Well, I know it is,
'cause I know that walk.

15:16.913 --> 15:17.746
- Well, I hope it is him.

15:17.746 --> 15:20.053
Otherwise this escapade is
gonna look a bit ridiculous

15:20.053 --> 15:22.314
when you find out it's not.

15:22.314 --> 15:24.816
- Well, it's worth taking
a chance, isn't it?

15:24.816 --> 15:27.961
I've never been able to sell
photos for this much before.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.642
- I think he's dead.

15:29.642 --> 15:31.786
And if he's not dead, then you
should just leave him alone.

15:31.786 --> 15:34.424
You're chasing a ghost.

15:34.424 --> 15:35.263
- Now, how can you say that?

15:35.263 --> 15:37.541
You're always complaining about money.

15:37.541 --> 15:39.219
And a story like this comes along.

15:39.219 --> 15:41.139
I get a chance to do these photos.

15:41.139 --> 15:43.562
And you go and say something like that?

15:43.562 --> 15:45.599
- I'll believe it when I see it.

15:45.599 --> 15:46.602
- Are you gonna be so high and mighty

15:46.602 --> 15:49.285
when I prove to the
world he's still alive?

15:49.285 --> 15:51.697
- And how are you gonna
do that? A picture?

15:51.697 --> 15:55.598
- Yeah. Tells a thousand
stories, doesn't it?

15:55.598 --> 15:56.639
- You even said yourself

15:56.639 --> 15:59.178
that he doesn't look like the same guy.

15:59.178 --> 16:01.082
He's bigger and fatter.

16:01.082 --> 16:02.783
And he's probably even bald

16:02.783 --> 16:05.439
underneath the hat that he's wearing.

16:05.439 --> 16:08.057
Only a true fan would recognize him.

16:08.057 --> 16:10.196
- Yeah, and that's to my advantage.

16:10.196 --> 16:14.863
You know, most people don't
know these things, but I do.

16:17.295 --> 16:19.956
- Perhaps you simply want it to be him.

16:19.956 --> 16:22.292
You saw some guy in a park,

16:22.292 --> 16:24.150
and you believe that it's the same guy

16:24.150 --> 16:26.811
from a book that alleges he's still alive.

16:26.811 --> 16:29.209
A self-fulfilling prophecy.

16:29.209 --> 16:31.542
- I'm telling you, it's him.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.263
- That's Brian Corner, isn't it?

16:59.263 --> 17:01.513
That, that is Brian Corner!

17:04.037 --> 17:06.656
just leave it like that

17:07.489 --> 17:12.489
like that, leave it like that

17:13.455 --> 17:15.494
- Hey, Brian Corner!

17:15.494 --> 17:19.293
Hey, Brian Corner! Come here, come here!

17:19.293 --> 17:22.126
When is the next album coming out?

17:30.275 --> 17:31.525
- Brian, can...

17:35.075 --> 17:37.206
Could I have a look at, could I play your,

17:37.206 --> 17:38.907
could I have a look at your guitar?

17:38.907 --> 17:39.824
Is that OK?

17:48.969 --> 17:49.929
This is the guitar he played

17:49.929 --> 17:53.346
on the "Blank Statement" album, isn't it?

17:56.327 --> 17:58.077
Can I, can I play it?

18:10.049 --> 18:11.630
- Brian, you forgot your guitar!

18:11.630 --> 18:13.550
- Can't believe it.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.939
Brian Corner, he left his guitar for me.

18:15.939 --> 18:18.009
He didn't leave it
for you. It's his guitar.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.837
- The guy's got hundreds
anyway. He's loaded.

18:20.837 --> 18:23.378
- It's not your guitar, though.

18:23.378 --> 18:24.930
- That's not fair, you lanky twat.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.538
- He did not leave the guitar for you.

18:27.538 --> 18:28.867
- I called dibs on it!

18:28.867 --> 18:29.856
- Yeah, but that doesn't mean-
- Plus, you guys

18:29.856 --> 18:31.970
don't even play guitar.

18:31.970 --> 18:33.303
- Yeah, so what?

18:34.668 --> 18:37.837
We'll sell it and split it three ways.

18:37.837 --> 18:38.846
Does that make you happy?

18:38.846 --> 18:39.679
- No.

18:42.126 --> 18:43.097
You know, I was reading somewhere.

18:43.097 --> 18:44.756
He was on this really long tour,

18:44.756 --> 18:47.756
and apparently he did so many drugs.

18:52.806 --> 18:53.639
- Hello.

18:55.007 --> 18:56.228
Hello?

18:56.228 --> 18:58.351
- You're a dead man walking, mate.

18:58.351 --> 19:02.095
- Listen, you don't scare
me, whoever you are.

19:02.095 --> 19:03.606
- Your book's bullshit, mate.

19:03.606 --> 19:06.006
- Well, the sales are sky high.

19:06.006 --> 19:08.426
- Normally I like a good fairytale.

19:08.426 --> 19:11.142
- What have I written that
you think is not the truth?

19:11.142 --> 19:13.984
The whole thing is quite
dubious, don't you think?

19:13.984 --> 19:15.222
- No. No, I don't, actually.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.425
The only thing that I think is dubious

19:17.425 --> 19:21.121
is your piece of shit
book of lies and innuendo.

19:21.121 --> 19:21.954
All right?

19:22.863 --> 19:25.276
- By the way, how'd you get this number?

19:25.276 --> 19:27.799
- Oh, I know everything about you, David.

19:27.799 --> 19:30.444
Where you live, what
you like for breakfast,

19:30.444 --> 19:33.206
your wife's routine, your kid's routine.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.027
- That's a bit extreme, don't you think?

19:36.027 --> 19:39.526
- Look, Brian Corner was a
friend of mine. All right?

19:39.526 --> 19:42.545
Now, he didn't ask for fame. Believe me.

19:42.545 --> 19:45.548
And people like you
are the reason he died.

19:45.548 --> 19:47.062
And if you think you're gonna get away

19:47.062 --> 19:48.486
with your little book of bullshit,

19:48.486 --> 19:51.498
well, you've got another thing coming.

19:51.498 --> 19:55.337
- Well, if he's dead, he's
dead. What do you care anyway?

19:55.337 --> 19:57.438
- D'you wanna know why he's
family and his true friends

19:57.438 --> 19:59.998
wouldn't talk to you
about your fucking book?

19:59.998 --> 20:02.874
That's because they had
respect for his memory.

20:02.874 --> 20:05.236
Pity you and your book
couldn't do the same, isn't it?

20:05.236 --> 20:07.876
- Hoo-hoo. I'd like to beg to differ.

20:07.876 --> 20:12.457
Didn't it ever occur to you
that they're protecting him?

20:12.457 --> 20:16.180
I think I made that argument
pretty strong, don't you think?

20:16.180 --> 20:19.654
- No. No, no, I don't think you
did, and that's the problem.

20:19.654 --> 20:23.140
Your book's bullshit, and you're
not gonna get away with it.

20:23.140 --> 20:25.557
Like I say, dead man walking.

21:07.377 --> 21:08.377
- Pizza guy.

21:22.001 --> 21:23.334
- Pizza guy, eh?

21:25.577 --> 21:27.657
You scared me for a bit.

21:27.657 --> 21:28.647
- You scared me.

21:28.647 --> 21:31.364
I didn't order pizza.

21:31.364 --> 21:32.447
- You didn't?

21:40.004 --> 21:41.254
Play us a song.

21:43.043 --> 21:45.820
- I suppose I won't be
getting you to sing, will I?

21:45.820 --> 21:47.743
I would love to hear you sing.

21:47.743 --> 21:49.161
- No, you don't.

21:49.161 --> 21:51.343
- Everyone can sing

21:51.343 --> 21:52.260
- Nonsense.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.362
- I have some friends coming around

22:04.362 --> 22:06.740
on Friday for my birthday.

22:06.740 --> 22:08.980
Would you like to join us for some drinks?

22:08.980 --> 22:11.940
And then we'll go for dinner.

22:11.940 --> 22:13.357
- Friday evening?

22:16.215 --> 22:19.314
I don't think I can make it.

22:19.314 --> 22:21.559
- I keep telling everyone
they need to meet you.

22:21.559 --> 22:25.454
They think you're a ghost.
A figment of my imagination.

22:25.454 --> 22:28.037
You must come. No more excuses.

22:30.919 --> 22:31.752
- Maybe.

22:33.912 --> 22:35.996
- You always say maybe.

22:35.996 --> 22:37.433
I've never, ever spent time with you

22:37.433 --> 22:39.295
in the presence of anyone else.

22:39.295 --> 22:40.873
- That's not true.

22:40.873 --> 22:42.553
I met your sister.

22:42.553 --> 22:44.668
- But you left two
minutes after she arrived,

22:44.668 --> 22:47.085
out of the door like a flash.

22:50.791 --> 22:55.335
Just because she asked you
a few personal questions.

22:55.335 --> 22:56.918
- I don't remember.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.633
I don't like crowds.

23:01.633 --> 23:04.466
- It's hardly going to be a crowd.

23:12.113 --> 23:12.946
- OK.

24:15.158 --> 24:17.716
- Excuse me. You know
where the station is?

24:17.716 --> 24:19.132
You know where the station is?
- Excuse me?

24:19.132 --> 24:20.371
- I said, do you know where the...

24:20.371 --> 24:21.954
- Ow! Fucking hell!

24:23.118 --> 24:26.035
- I said you're a dead man walking.

25:09.557 --> 25:12.140
- Ivan. Have a look at this.

25:12.140 --> 25:13.418
- I'm sleeping.

25:13.418 --> 25:15.164
- You have to read this. No, wake up.

25:15.164 --> 25:16.220
- Leave me alone!

25:16.220 --> 25:18.041
- No, wake up!

25:18.041 --> 25:19.458
- No.
- He did it.

25:20.479 --> 25:23.962
He killed the writer. It's
right here on the BBC.

25:23.962 --> 25:25.795
He stabbed him. Nigel.

25:26.833 --> 25:27.666
He did it.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.446
- Give me that thing.

25:34.175 --> 25:35.842
David worked for it.

25:42.855 --> 25:44.557
It doesn't say anything about Nigel.

25:44.557 --> 25:45.415
What are you talking about?

25:45.415 --> 25:48.994
- He said he was going
to do it. He did it.

25:48.994 --> 25:50.775
- It's just a coincidence.

25:50.775 --> 25:52.876
Also, this writer had a lot of enemies.

25:52.876 --> 25:55.858
- That seems a pretty big
coincidence, I would say.

25:55.858 --> 26:00.696
- Well, according to the police
report, it was a robbery.

26:00.696 --> 26:04.275
They stole his wallet. It was coincidence.

26:04.275 --> 26:06.435
- I reported him to the police.

26:06.435 --> 26:08.915
The blood is on our hands now.

26:08.915 --> 26:09.869
- It wasn't Nigel.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.369
- Who was it then?

26:12.263 --> 26:15.165
- How am I supposed to know? Let me sleep.

26:15.165 --> 26:18.665
- How can you sleep knowing what you know?

26:22.103 --> 26:23.708
I'm reporting it to the police.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.452
Oh, Go ahead.

26:25.452 --> 26:27.785
- And you're coming with me.

26:30.630 --> 26:34.892
- When I turned round
the corner, he'd gone.

26:34.892 --> 26:38.172
- Maybe you imagined it all then.

26:38.172 --> 26:40.173
- Are you thinking I'm seeing ghosts now?

26:40.173 --> 26:42.387
The camera doesn't lie.

26:42.387 --> 26:44.893
- I'm sorry, but it's an obsession now.

26:44.893 --> 26:48.976
- What's wrong with
obsession? It pays the bills.

26:50.791 --> 26:52.471
- Why don't you just go
up to him and ask him,

26:52.471 --> 26:54.388
"Are you Brian Corner?"

26:55.314 --> 26:56.770
- That's a good idea.

26:56.770 --> 26:58.290
"Hello, Brian.

26:58.290 --> 27:00.024
Excuse me, do you mind if
I just take your photo,

27:00.024 --> 27:01.826
and expose you to the world?"

27:01.826 --> 27:05.204
- So what you're gonna do then?

27:05.204 --> 27:08.647
- I don't know. 10 more photos, I suppose.

27:08.647 --> 27:11.389
- You better hurry up before
someone beats you to it.

27:11.389 --> 27:12.222
Why don't you try and take one

27:12.222 --> 27:13.906
of his face instead of his back

27:13.906 --> 27:16.989
so people can actually see who it is?

27:21.586 --> 27:22.419
- Lovely.

27:32.029 --> 27:33.869
- Tonight, I'd like to
welcome to the show.

27:33.869 --> 27:36.887
renowned criminal profiler, Jerry Stark,

27:36.887 --> 27:39.330
to discuss the recent spate of murders

27:39.330 --> 27:42.429
of journalists and media personalities.

27:42.429 --> 27:45.486
Obviously, this is an
issue close to my heart,

27:45.486 --> 27:47.620
and to be pretty frank, quite frightening.

27:47.620 --> 27:49.758
But we'll will not run
away from this issue.

27:49.758 --> 27:53.534
We will face this issue
head-on, as we've always done.

27:53.534 --> 27:55.955
So Mr. Jerry Stark, what
does your experience tell you

27:55.955 --> 28:00.275
about these murders of journalists
and media personalities?

28:00.275 --> 28:03.016
- I don't believe it was a lone murderer.

28:03.016 --> 28:05.452
They're copycat killings.

28:05.452 --> 28:09.214
- But do you think it all
started with the release

28:09.214 --> 28:13.828
and publication of David
Watford's book on Brian Corner?

28:13.828 --> 28:17.831
- There has to be a catalyst
and that could be the catalyst.

28:17.831 --> 28:19.704
But there were other suspicious deaths

28:19.704 --> 28:22.411
in the years previous that could indicate

28:22.411 --> 28:25.950
that the murders were
already set in motion.

28:25.950 --> 28:29.793
They just picked up steam
with Watford's book.

28:29.793 --> 28:31.435
- It's pretty frightening times.

28:31.435 --> 28:33.131
I've had to hire a bodyguard,

28:33.131 --> 28:35.515
and I don't go out the same way I used to.

28:35.515 --> 28:37.313
- It's not a lone killer.

28:37.313 --> 28:39.851
So long as you keep
yourself pretty visible,

28:39.851 --> 28:41.894
you should be OK.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.449
Don't walk down any dark alleys.

28:43.449 --> 28:47.494
- But if it's multiple killers,
copycats, as you think,

28:47.494 --> 28:50.193
then surely one of them is
gonna wanna take the limelight

28:50.193 --> 28:53.537
and take a risk of getting
caught, even in broad daylight.

28:53.537 --> 28:55.937
I'm not sure that I wanna be a victim.

28:55.937 --> 28:58.743
- Well, you should be careful, obviously.

28:58.743 --> 29:01.863
The problem is, the more
you cover for the story,

29:01.863 --> 29:04.274
the more interest to propel a copycat

29:04.274 --> 29:06.798
to become part of the story.

29:06.798 --> 29:08.376
- Well, I'm just trying to make a living.

29:08.376 --> 29:11.436
I ask questions. I have
no political agenda.

29:11.436 --> 29:13.198
- Are you sure about that?

29:13.198 --> 29:16.638
- Look, I have people from
all political affiliations,

29:16.638 --> 29:17.836
all walks of life on the show.

29:17.836 --> 29:22.003
I'm open minded. How the
hell has it come to this?

29:22.936 --> 29:25.814
- We live in crazy times.

29:25.814 --> 29:28.915
But let's not forget, the 1970s and 1980s

29:28.915 --> 29:32.498
were much more fruitful
for serial killers.

29:33.656 --> 29:37.239
DNA profiling, better
policing, cellphones,

29:39.313 --> 29:42.171
all of these things have
made it much more difficult

29:42.171 --> 29:44.504
for serial killers to exist.

29:46.009 --> 29:49.009
These people are smart, intelligent.

29:52.155 --> 29:54.572
They have adapted their game.

29:55.611 --> 29:57.944
As I said, they're copycats.

30:03.874 --> 30:06.541
- You're a fucking idiot, Stark.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.371
Copycats!

30:11.371 --> 30:12.871
Copycats, my arse.

30:19.792 --> 30:20.625
Ow! Ah!

30:42.411 --> 30:43.411
- Who is it?

30:45.814 --> 30:46.647
Pizza guy?

30:48.388 --> 30:49.805
He's not allowed.

31:02.731 --> 31:04.331
I knew you wouldn't come.

31:04.331 --> 31:05.835
- Sorry. I was busy.

31:05.835 --> 31:06.668
- Liar.

31:09.123 --> 31:10.835
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

31:10.835 --> 31:15.550
- I don't think I should
after you stood me up again.

31:15.550 --> 31:16.383
- Sorry.

31:31.860 --> 31:36.860
you're rolling in clover

31:44.879 --> 31:46.442
- I just had friends over for lunch.

31:46.442 --> 31:48.616
Shame you missed them all again.

31:48.616 --> 31:51.783
Your timing is always impeccably poor.

31:58.202 --> 32:02.035
- Pure coincidence, my
dear. Pure coincidence.

32:03.221 --> 32:04.054
- So.

32:05.385 --> 32:07.635
What do I owe the pleasure?

32:08.872 --> 32:11.388
- Well, I wanted to tell you

32:11.388 --> 32:15.388
that I'm gonna be going
away for a little while.

32:16.733 --> 32:19.733
I didn't want you to worry about me.

32:22.573 --> 32:23.406
- Who is she?

32:23.406 --> 32:25.533
- Does it matter?

32:25.533 --> 32:26.866
- I suppose not.

32:30.105 --> 32:31.605
- She's my sister.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.528
- Your sister?

32:34.528 --> 32:35.528
- My sister.

32:36.584 --> 32:37.613
We are
celebrating the music

32:37.613 --> 32:39.469
of Brian Corner today.

32:39.469 --> 32:42.312
We are taking requests and
playing the Brian Corner songs

32:42.312 --> 32:45.875
you want to hear the most,
from the hits to the obscure.

33:08.444 --> 33:13.444
a kid all over again

33:19.740 --> 33:24.740
from a book I read

33:26.039 --> 33:30.882
your seed in my head

33:30.882 --> 33:35.882
met somewhere before

34:01.157 --> 34:06.058
a kid all over again

34:11.072 --> 34:16.072
a kid all over again

34:26.685 --> 34:28.222
The late, great Chloe Gates

34:28.222 --> 34:30.624
sang on half a dozen songs with the band.

34:30.624 --> 34:33.684
She sang with Brian on this
one, my personal favorite.

34:41.328 --> 34:46.328
you were lying next to me

37:11.693 --> 37:16.693
you were lying next to me

39:25.355 --> 39:26.188
- Oh, Boo!

39:45.216 --> 39:46.075
- Good afternoon.

39:46.075 --> 39:46.908
- Hey.

39:48.315 --> 39:49.275
How are you doing?

39:49.275 --> 39:51.115
- Good, thanks. What can I get you?

39:51.115 --> 39:54.013
- Ah, just a Coke, please.

39:54.013 --> 39:56.694
Any hotels around here? B&Bs or anything?

39:56.694 --> 39:59.531
- We have rooms upstairs.

39:59.531 --> 40:00.891
- Take card as well?

40:00.891 --> 40:01.891
- Of course.

40:06.669 --> 40:10.369
- Going for a walk in this
town, and well, it's lovely.

40:10.369 --> 40:12.068
Some nice houses.

40:12.068 --> 40:14.228
A massive house down a private road.

40:14.228 --> 40:15.889
Who lives there?

40:15.889 --> 40:17.830
- Why do you want to know?

40:17.830 --> 40:19.846
- Just curious.

40:19.846 --> 40:21.529
- Not really for me to say.

40:21.529 --> 40:23.329
- Oh. No worries.

40:23.329 --> 40:25.785
I'm just a curious person, I guess.

40:25.785 --> 40:27.487
What's your name?

40:27.487 --> 40:28.884
- Penelope.

40:28.884 --> 40:29.717
- Peter.

40:30.563 --> 40:31.764
- Nice to meet you, Peter.

40:31.764 --> 40:33.764
- Nice to meet you, too.

40:44.068 --> 40:46.484
So what's there to do around here?

40:46.484 --> 40:49.488
- Well, there is always the park.

40:49.488 --> 40:50.525
- Park?

40:50.525 --> 40:52.694
- Yeah, the park.

40:52.694 --> 40:54.825
You look like you could
use a bit of nature.

40:54.825 --> 40:55.696
- Is that right?

40:57.296 --> 40:58.256
- What are you doing tomorrow?

40:58.256 --> 40:59.673
- Don't know yet.

41:00.776 --> 41:02.077
- What about this park?

41:02.077 --> 41:03.410
- What about it?

41:21.017 --> 41:22.691
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:09.462 --> 42:12.295
- You can answer that if you want.

42:16.747 --> 42:18.851
Someone special?

42:18.851 --> 42:20.112
- Business.

42:20.112 --> 42:23.269
- What exactly is your business?

42:23.269 --> 42:25.385
- Um, long story.

42:25.385 --> 42:26.661
I can tell you in the park tomorrow.

42:26.661 --> 42:27.494
- Ah!

42:27.494 --> 42:29.003
- You can help me with something.

42:29.003 --> 42:31.883
- Yeah, well, maybe, maybe not.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.830
- What have you got to lose?

42:33.830 --> 42:35.484
- Everything.

43:26.535 --> 43:27.618
- "Cornered."

43:59.852 --> 44:01.852
Thank you.

44:09.954 --> 44:11.372
- It's beautiful.

44:11.372 --> 44:12.955
- Yeah. I think so.

44:15.815 --> 44:19.932
So you were gonna tell me
what you do for a living.

44:19.932 --> 44:20.765
- Ha, OK.

44:21.608 --> 44:22.594
But you can't laugh.

44:22.594 --> 44:25.096
- All right. Promise.

44:25.096 --> 44:27.832
- All right, and that as well.

44:27.832 --> 44:28.749
Right then.

44:30.076 --> 44:32.978
Ah, well, I'm a photographer.

44:32.978 --> 44:33.978
- Hilarious?

44:34.837 --> 44:37.122
- OK, well, not a
photographer. A paparazzi.

44:37.122 --> 44:40.479
- Oh, God, paparazzi. What a shame.

44:40.479 --> 44:41.312
- I haven't been doing it long.

44:41.312 --> 44:43.835
It's just, it pays the bills, all right?

44:43.835 --> 44:44.998
- Is that what you're doing here?

44:44.998 --> 44:48.295
Did you follow someone
to take their photo?

44:48.295 --> 44:51.112
- It's more of a personal
project. Detective work.

44:51.112 --> 44:55.695
- Detective work? Gosh, you
make it sound so glamorous.

44:58.892 --> 45:00.184
- I'm not sure I'm doing a very good job.

45:00.184 --> 45:02.561
But you might be able to help.

45:02.561 --> 45:03.394
- How?

45:04.819 --> 45:07.083
- The person I'm looking for lives nearby.

45:07.083 --> 45:10.631
- Hmm-mm. There isn't
anyone famous around here.

45:10.631 --> 45:11.996
- I believe there is.

45:11.996 --> 45:12.829
- Who?

45:14.039 --> 45:16.177
- It's a guy called Brian Corner.

45:16.177 --> 45:20.316
A musician who disappeared
around 30 years ago, in the '80s.

45:20.316 --> 45:24.416
Supposedly died, but I
don't believe he did.

45:24.416 --> 45:26.117
- I don't know him.

45:26.117 --> 45:28.199
- Well, I can show you some
photos. You can take a look.

45:28.199 --> 45:31.036
You see, he may have been in the pub.

45:31.036 --> 45:33.053
- All right, but why not
just leave him alone?

45:33.053 --> 45:37.600
I mean, if he wants to be
dead, then let him be dead.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.242
- But it's my job, you know.

45:39.242 --> 45:41.575
- It's not really an excuse.

45:44.662 --> 45:46.329
- Brilliant, I mean,

45:47.180 --> 45:51.391
I suppose I do need to
focus on looking for him.

45:51.391 --> 45:52.860
- Sorry to have been a distraction.

45:52.860 --> 45:54.044
- No, it's not your fault.

45:54.044 --> 45:55.307
- You didn't have to come
here today, you know.

45:55.307 --> 45:57.291
- No, I wanted to come here.

45:57.291 --> 46:00.513
I really wanted to come here
with you, to be with you.

46:00.513 --> 46:02.134
I wanted to.

46:02.134 --> 46:04.784
But I do need to keep
looking for him as well.

46:04.784 --> 46:07.344
- Focus on that if
that's what you wanna do.

46:07.344 --> 46:09.339
- OK, but look, I'm gonna
show you the photos.

46:09.339 --> 46:11.412
At least have a look.

46:11.412 --> 46:14.252
And you may recognize him.

46:14.252 --> 46:15.085
OK?
- Sure.

46:16.601 --> 46:17.518
- Let's go.

46:23.033 --> 46:24.533
- Wake up!

46:24.533 --> 46:28.200
Look who's here!

46:32.817 --> 46:35.974
So to what do I owe your presence?

46:35.974 --> 46:40.316
- No reason. Just felt
like coming for a visit.

46:40.316 --> 46:41.414
- Just like that?

46:41.414 --> 46:42.831
- Just like that.

47:24.396 --> 47:28.540
is anyone's guess

48:27.249 --> 48:30.428
- I've been tinkering with
some of the old songs.

48:30.428 --> 48:31.511
- Oh, really?

48:33.029 --> 48:33.862
- Yup.

48:35.910 --> 48:37.548
- I'd like to have a listen.

48:37.548 --> 48:41.215
- Well, it could do
with some of your magic.

48:43.489 --> 48:45.739
- Well, I'll have a listen.

48:54.780 --> 48:57.140
- Not doing a very good job, am I?

48:57.140 --> 48:57.973
- What are you talking about?

48:57.973 --> 48:59.679
I think you're a wonderful photographer.

48:59.679 --> 49:00.801
- You think so?

49:00.801 --> 49:03.664
- Yeah. Look, take my photograph.

49:03.664 --> 49:04.497
Just my eyes.

49:04.497 --> 49:05.584
- Mm-hmm.

49:09.699 --> 49:10.859
- Did you get just my eyes?

49:10.859 --> 49:11.867
- Yeah. Have a look.

49:11.867 --> 49:12.867
- Let's see.

49:13.727 --> 49:15.148
- Hey!

49:15.148 --> 49:16.468
Come back here with that.

49:16.468 --> 49:17.669
It's worth a lot of money.

49:17.669 --> 49:19.509
Who needs money?

49:19.509 --> 49:20.426
- Everyone.

49:23.413 --> 49:26.496
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

49:27.690 --> 49:30.773
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

49:38.729 --> 49:39.562
There's the thief.

49:41.150 --> 49:41.983
- Delete all your pictures?

49:41.983 --> 49:43.241
- Ah, yeah, you wouldn't dare.

49:43.241 --> 49:44.518
- Oh, wouldn't I?

49:44.518 --> 49:46.575
No. Oh!

49:46.575 --> 49:47.422
- Serves you right.

49:47.422 --> 49:50.286
Karma for taking pictures of
poor, unsuspecting people.

49:50.286 --> 49:51.119
Is that right?

49:51.119 --> 49:52.564
- Yeah, yeah, there we go.

49:52.564 --> 49:54.609
Loving it, loving it, loving it.

49:54.609 --> 49:56.104
- Come now. OK, your turn now.

49:56.104 --> 49:57.712
Come on, give it back.
- Oh God. Really?

49:57.712 --> 49:58.901
- Over to the professional.

49:58.901 --> 50:00.533
Oh, look at that.

50:00.533 --> 50:02.912
Done this before, haven't you, eh?

50:02.912 --> 50:04.032
Don't stick your tongue out at me.

50:04.032 --> 50:05.931
Put that away. Put that away.

50:05.931 --> 50:07.504
Give us a nice little smile, yeah?

50:07.504 --> 50:09.337
- Fine.
- Look at that.

50:10.271 --> 50:13.257
Picture perfect. Go on then, come on.

50:13.257 --> 50:15.198
- All right, I fancy a pint.

50:15.198 --> 50:16.195
You fancy a pint, eh?

50:16.195 --> 50:18.078
- Enough nature for one day.

50:18.078 --> 50:19.404
Come on.

50:19.404 --> 50:24.404
you are the worst one

51:21.728 --> 51:23.498
- Here for the sun?

51:23.498 --> 51:25.248
- Ah, it's beautiful.

51:29.351 --> 51:31.809
- What do you think about these murders?

51:31.809 --> 51:34.272
I never liked that whatsit fellow myself,

51:34.272 --> 51:36.689
but he didn't deserve to die.

51:38.118 --> 51:39.701
Nor did the others.

51:42.047 --> 51:46.022
Anyway, they'll catch him
eventually, whoever it is.

51:46.022 --> 51:48.561
- Could it not be a she?

51:48.561 --> 51:50.758
- Could be a network.

51:50.758 --> 51:51.591
- Nah.

51:52.758 --> 51:53.761
Conspiracies don't work

51:53.761 --> 51:57.344
when there's more than
two people involved.

51:58.276 --> 52:00.359
- Don't worry about them.

52:02.594 --> 52:04.376
How are your mother and father?

52:04.376 --> 52:05.959
- Ah, they're fine.

52:07.635 --> 52:12.635
- They must wanna see you.

52:12.690 --> 52:15.190
- I talk to them on the phone.

52:16.050 --> 52:17.883
- You should go visit.

52:19.400 --> 52:20.233
- Yeah.

52:21.510 --> 52:23.317
That'd be nice.

52:25.664 --> 52:28.583
- Why don't you answer
that? Don't mind me.

52:36.527 --> 52:37.360
- Hello?

52:38.263 --> 52:40.322
Hi, sweetheart.

52:40.322 --> 52:42.298
- Where are you?

52:42.298 --> 52:46.221
Um, not sure. Couple
of hours outside of London.

52:46.221 --> 52:50.119
I thought he was going
to this shop, but...

52:50.119 --> 52:52.418
- When are you back, Peter?

52:52.418 --> 52:54.919
I don't know. I just got here.

52:54.919 --> 52:57.602
- So you're just gonna
keep following him around?

52:57.602 --> 53:01.615
Well, yeah, that's
the plan. Follow him around.

53:01.615 --> 53:04.148
- Has he noticed that
you're following him?

53:04.148 --> 53:07.231
No, no. I'm a professional.

53:07.231 --> 53:11.172
- So how long are you gonna
keep following him around for?

53:11.172 --> 53:12.906
Why, I need more proof.

53:12.906 --> 53:16.139
A picture that's clearer, to
be matched with an older one.

53:16.139 --> 53:19.181
The more photos I take, the better.

53:19.181 --> 53:21.103
- Why don't you take
a picture of his ears?

53:21.103 --> 53:22.599
It's the best way to identify him.

53:22.599 --> 53:27.598
I watched a documentary
on it. The ears don't lie.

53:27.598 --> 53:28.980
Oh, dammit, he's just walked by!

53:28.980 --> 53:30.647
I'll call you later.

53:48.938 --> 53:50.855
- That new credit card.

53:52.295 --> 53:53.941
Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it, I got it.

53:53.941 --> 53:55.071
Thank you.

53:55.071 --> 53:57.962
- Good. Speaking of cards.

53:57.962 --> 54:02.258
Do you ever wish you'd play
your cards differently?

54:02.258 --> 54:03.330
- Not anymore.

54:03.330 --> 54:06.193
But you did at one time?

54:06.193 --> 54:09.136
- When I was younger, of course. Sure.

54:09.136 --> 54:11.360
- What do you mean?

54:11.360 --> 54:13.600
- You know what I mean.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.499
- I suppose I do.

54:15.499 --> 54:17.378
You know, I always used to love to play

54:17.378 --> 54:20.022
capture the flag when I was a kid.

54:20.022 --> 54:22.189
I was very good, you know.

54:23.382 --> 54:25.099
I knew all the best spots.

54:25.099 --> 54:28.995
The shady places where you
could hide in the shade,

54:28.995 --> 54:33.162
in the shadows, so you
could sneak up on somebody.

54:35.336 --> 54:37.393
And the guy who was guarding
the opponent's flag,

54:37.393 --> 54:39.060
he always got itchy.

54:40.815 --> 54:43.871
And eventually, he would leave his post

54:43.871 --> 54:47.356
to find out what was
happening nearer our flag.

54:47.356 --> 54:51.773
And I would run in, grab
that flag, and away with me.

54:54.714 --> 54:58.796
- Capture the flag is make believe, Jack.

54:58.796 --> 55:01.046
Real war, life is at stake.

55:02.156 --> 55:06.770
- Couldn't you just let me
have my moment of glory?

55:06.770 --> 55:09.603
- Sorry, it's a good story. Go on.

55:12.033 --> 55:15.253
- Tell you what. Let's
continue over dinner.

55:15.253 --> 55:16.956
- All right.

55:16.956 --> 55:18.456
What's for dinner?

55:19.895 --> 55:21.116
Fish pie.

55:21.116 --> 55:22.033
- Fish pie?

55:22.913 --> 55:25.163
Kittycat get some fish pie?

55:32.010 --> 55:32.843
- Yeah.

55:54.945 --> 55:59.945
is I'll be all right

56:24.690 --> 56:28.194
some pretty tough times

56:58.690 --> 57:01.054
- Hey. Why don't you pick up your phone?

57:01.054 --> 57:04.051
I've been trying to call you for days.

57:04.051 --> 57:06.468
Are you all right? I hope so.

57:07.651 --> 57:09.630
Listen, I'm not calling to invite you

57:09.630 --> 57:11.033
to any more of my parties.

57:11.033 --> 57:14.590
You don't have to think up any
more lame excuses, all right?

57:14.590 --> 57:16.851
I just wanted to say hi. That's all.

57:16.851 --> 57:20.313
I have no questions
whatsoever to ask you. Nada.

57:20.313 --> 57:22.909
So you can put yourself at ease.

57:22.909 --> 57:26.574
And call me back once
you get it, all right?

57:26.574 --> 57:30.574
It would be nice to hear
your voice anyway. Bye.

57:35.374 --> 57:36.730
- You know, I think that
was the best fish pie

57:36.730 --> 57:38.807
since the last time I had your fish pie.

57:38.807 --> 57:41.474
- Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

57:49.149 --> 57:50.923
Well, it's good to know

57:50.923 --> 57:54.587
I'll have such adulation after I'm dead.

57:54.587 --> 57:56.507
Better late than never, I suppose.

57:56.507 --> 57:58.310
- Truer words were never spoken.

57:58.310 --> 58:00.006
- Easy for you to say.

58:00.006 --> 58:01.947
- You will reap your rewards in heaven.

58:01.947 --> 58:04.030
- So you keep telling me.

58:06.067 --> 58:10.230
By the way, your old band
mate has a new album out.

58:10.230 --> 58:12.081
- Yeah, I know.

58:12.081 --> 58:13.348
What did you think?

58:13.348 --> 58:14.641
- It's good.

58:14.641 --> 58:16.141
- It's diabolical!

58:19.067 --> 58:19.900
- Harsh.

58:22.630 --> 58:23.463
- Thanks.

58:27.867 --> 58:28.700
Aw.

58:29.613 --> 58:31.516
I barely slept.

58:31.516 --> 58:32.918
- Why not?

58:32.918 --> 58:35.617
- It's just that I'm taking photos.

58:35.617 --> 58:37.117
- What did you do?

58:38.054 --> 58:39.894
- I'm just taking some great shots.

58:39.894 --> 58:40.849
- You didn't.

58:40.849 --> 58:41.682
- Yeah.

58:43.094 --> 58:45.097
But he was with this, some other man.

58:45.097 --> 58:48.257
I don't know, his father or
uncle or something like that.

58:48.257 --> 58:50.590
- Here, look. I'll show you.

58:54.060 --> 58:56.081
You recognize him now?

58:56.081 --> 59:00.415
- No. No, I've told you,
I've never seen him before.

59:00.415 --> 59:03.832
- Well, what about that guy
he's having dinner with?

59:03.832 --> 59:06.332
- Nope. Never seen him either.

59:10.260 --> 59:13.438
Look, what are you even
gonna do with these pictures?

59:13.438 --> 59:14.718
- Sell 'em.

59:14.718 --> 59:15.551
- To who?

59:17.278 --> 59:20.360
- I know people who'll
buy them, all right?

59:20.360 --> 59:23.604
That's it. My work here is done.

59:23.604 --> 59:25.519
It's time to party.
We've got to celebrate.

59:25.519 --> 59:27.679
Time to go somewhere,
do something. Anywhere.

59:27.679 --> 59:29.199
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

59:29.199 --> 59:30.290
OK then.

59:30.290 --> 59:31.695
- Come on, lead the way.

59:31.695 --> 59:32.528
- All right, fine.

59:32.528 --> 59:34.489
- Great. I must make a call.

59:34.489 --> 59:37.072
I'll be back in a minute. Yeah.

59:43.857 --> 59:46.107
They, they're good. Mm-hmm.

59:47.174 --> 59:51.007
About 10 or 15. That'll
be enough to cover it.

59:53.396 --> 59:54.229
Yeah.

59:56.176 --> 59:58.593
Could be worth a lot, I think

1:00:00.268 --> 1:00:01.564
- Look, there's no word. I do not.

1:00:01.564 --> 1:00:02.604
- Yeah, she's good.
- She's canceled.

1:00:02.604 --> 1:00:04.214
- She's canceled.

1:00:04.214 --> 1:00:05.698
- You never feed the padded pasta.

1:00:08.069 --> 1:00:11.069
That was such a good point.

1:00:22.790 --> 1:00:23.957
- How are you?

1:00:28.129 --> 1:00:30.212
When are you coming back?

1:00:34.858 --> 1:00:38.358
I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:41.107
In a good way.

1:00:42.273 --> 1:00:44.023
In an unexpected way.

1:00:47.839 --> 1:00:49.422
You left your book.

1:00:53.076 --> 1:00:55.476
I've been reading it, actually.

1:00:55.476 --> 1:00:56.309
I like it.

1:00:57.394 --> 1:00:58.727
Very mysterious.

1:01:03.039 --> 1:01:04.206
I believed it.

1:01:05.755 --> 1:01:08.088
So when are you coming back?

1:01:11.179 --> 1:01:12.012
Jack?

1:01:13.642 --> 1:01:14.642
Jack, hello?

1:01:25.575 --> 1:01:27.739
- Been an amazing few days with you.

1:01:27.739 --> 1:01:29.576
I could get used to
this whole nature thing.

1:01:29.576 --> 1:01:30.659
- Well, good.

1:01:33.821 --> 1:01:37.939
- I came here to find Brian
Corner, and I found you.

1:01:37.939 --> 1:01:39.261
That's what I call a bonus.

1:01:39.261 --> 1:01:44.077
- Well, what's better? Meeting
me or taking his photograph?

1:01:44.077 --> 1:01:45.496
- Oh, that's a tricky one.

1:01:45.496 --> 1:01:47.661
- God, you're horrible!

1:01:47.661 --> 1:01:49.078
- You, obviously.

1:01:50.316 --> 1:01:51.149
Obviously.

1:01:56.040 --> 1:01:59.736
God, you know, I really,
really don't wanna leave.

1:01:59.736 --> 1:02:02.157
But I need to get these
photos back to London.

1:02:02.157 --> 1:02:04.375
- Leave them. They're not important.

1:02:04.375 --> 1:02:07.125
- You don't know how big this is.

1:02:11.283 --> 1:02:13.950
What's the matter? What's wrong.

1:02:18.563 --> 1:02:19.396
- Peter.

1:02:21.437 --> 1:02:25.604
Look, I don't think it's
right, what you're doing?

1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:28.023
- What do you mean?

1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:32.247
- This guy. He doesn't wanna be alive.

1:02:33.677 --> 1:02:37.813
He doesn't wanna be known.
He just wants a quiet life.

1:02:37.813 --> 1:02:41.416
And your photos are an
intrusion into his privacy.

1:02:41.416 --> 1:02:42.249
I think...

1:02:44.317 --> 1:02:47.779
I think you should throw them away.

1:02:47.779 --> 1:02:49.029
- Destroy them?

1:02:50.965 --> 1:02:52.141
It's too late.

1:02:52.141 --> 1:02:53.821
The agent's got the ball
rolling on it. I can't.

1:02:53.821 --> 1:02:56.083
- Oh, come on, Peter.
You're a great photographer.

1:02:56.083 --> 1:02:58.723
You don't need this
sleaze. It's beneath you.

1:02:58.723 --> 1:03:00.223
- How do you know?

1:03:02.685 --> 1:03:03.518
- Well,

1:03:04.542 --> 1:03:07.043
I know that I can't let myself fall

1:03:07.043 --> 1:03:09.758
for someone I can't respect.

1:03:09.758 --> 1:03:14.008
If you sell those photos,
then I won't respect you.

1:03:17.081 --> 1:03:18.664
- Is that a threat?

1:03:19.961 --> 1:03:20.794
- No.

1:03:22.715 --> 1:03:24.715
No, it's just the truth.

1:04:24.567 --> 1:04:25.900
- There you are.

1:04:28.594 --> 1:04:30.333
- I missed this place.

1:04:30.333 --> 1:04:31.166
- Oh.

1:04:32.651 --> 1:04:34.397
Stay as long as you like.

1:04:34.397 --> 1:04:35.954
It's your place, after all.

1:04:35.954 --> 1:04:37.037
- It's yours.

1:04:37.895 --> 1:04:41.473
- Your gift to me for playing my part

1:04:41.473 --> 1:04:44.306
so adequately for all these years.

1:04:45.677 --> 1:04:49.415
To be fair, it's a very easy role to play.

1:04:49.415 --> 1:04:51.394
- Those are the best ones.

1:04:51.394 --> 1:04:54.311
- I'd rather have played your role.

1:04:55.575 --> 1:04:56.575
- Which one?

1:04:57.954 --> 1:04:58.871
- You know.

1:05:01.037 --> 1:05:02.855
- Well, if you wish.

1:05:02.855 --> 1:05:06.438
- I'm too old for that
now. And so are you.

1:05:08.135 --> 1:05:11.500
But we might not have any choice after all

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:14.257
with these recent developments.

1:05:14.257 --> 1:05:17.507
You're suddenly becoming popular again.

1:05:19.105 --> 1:05:23.188
I suppose that's the reason
you've come to visit.

1:05:27.921 --> 1:05:29.004
- You got me.

1:05:30.583 --> 1:05:31.916
- There you are.

1:05:34.237 --> 1:05:35.402
This is
one of those obscure

1:05:35.402 --> 1:05:37.845
Brian Corner numbers I
was telling you about

1:05:37.845 --> 1:05:39.564
that they found in his loft.

1:05:39.564 --> 1:05:42.625
His mother said it was the
first song he ever recorded,

1:05:42.625 --> 1:05:44.567
when he was 13 years old.

1:05:44.567 --> 1:05:45.607
- You all right, mate?

1:05:45.607 --> 1:05:47.367
- Uh, I'm fine.

1:05:47.367 --> 1:05:49.788
Lemme buy you a drink.

1:05:49.788 --> 1:05:52.046
- Nah. I'm all right, thanks.

1:05:52.046 --> 1:05:53.868
- Oh, come on.

1:05:53.868 --> 1:05:55.724
- Honestly, I'm all right.

1:05:55.724 --> 1:05:58.428
How many nights are you
spending here at the hotel?

1:05:58.428 --> 1:06:01.970
- Yeah, I'm just going
back to London tomorrow.

1:06:01.970 --> 1:06:04.900
It's quite a place you got here.

1:06:04.900 --> 1:06:07.578
Penelope was here the other day.

1:06:07.578 --> 1:06:12.293
- Penelope, yeah. She was
working here yesterday, actually.

1:06:12.293 --> 1:06:14.126
- Ah, yeah. Yesterday.

1:06:15.679 --> 1:06:17.199
Do you know her well?

1:06:17.199 --> 1:06:18.699
- Nah, not really.

1:06:21.343 --> 1:06:22.275
- She's cool.

1:06:22.275 --> 1:06:25.025
- Yeah, she's all right, I guess.

1:06:38.002 --> 1:06:39.335
- If you say so.

1:06:41.217 --> 1:06:43.578
Did you two ever go out?

1:06:43.578 --> 1:06:46.078
- What kinda question is that?

1:06:49.213 --> 1:06:51.397
- I'll get over her.

1:06:51.397 --> 1:06:53.557
- Mate, you barely even know the girl.

1:06:53.557 --> 1:06:56.390
I think you're a little bit drunk.

1:06:58.416 --> 1:07:00.458
- We spent a lot of time together.

1:07:00.458 --> 1:07:01.541
- Oh, really?

1:07:02.437 --> 1:07:05.856
She shouldn't be spending
time with the clients.

1:07:05.856 --> 1:07:09.354
- Well, I won't tell if you don't.

1:07:09.354 --> 1:07:10.187
Seriously.

1:07:11.178 --> 1:07:12.117
I think I love her.

1:07:12.117 --> 1:07:14.517
- Yeah, yeah. You said that already.

1:07:14.517 --> 1:07:16.593
- Well, you don't believe me.

1:07:16.593 --> 1:07:19.760
- Mate, I don't even know who you are.

1:07:21.145 --> 1:07:22.728
- What's your name?

1:07:23.674 --> 1:07:25.091
- Arturo Bandini.

1:07:28.453 --> 1:07:29.870
- Arturo Bandini.

1:07:33.889 --> 1:07:35.889
That's a hell of a name.

1:07:37.317 --> 1:07:39.114
Brian, if you're out there,

1:07:39.114 --> 1:07:42.213
as the late David Watford
so steadfastly claimed,

1:07:42.213 --> 1:07:43.772
I hope you're well.

1:07:43.772 --> 1:07:47.013
But I think that's just wishful thinking.

1:08:22.053 --> 1:08:24.220
- What are you doing here?

1:08:26.597 --> 1:08:28.014
- I'm a bit lost.

1:08:28.968 --> 1:08:32.610
- Maybe you need to find
your way out of here then.

1:08:32.610 --> 1:08:33.610
- Good idea.

1:08:36.437 --> 1:08:37.597
Can I get the camera, please?

1:08:37.597 --> 1:08:38.430
- Fast.

1:08:41.997 --> 1:08:42.830
Faster.

1:08:54.008 --> 1:08:55.696
Leave the cat alone.

1:08:55.696 --> 1:08:57.914
Leave the cat alone.

1:08:57.914 --> 1:08:58.747
Take your hat.

1:08:58.747 --> 1:09:00.114
- Ah, yeah. Thanks.

1:09:00.114 --> 1:09:03.394
- Don't wanna see you here again.

1:09:03.394 --> 1:09:04.227
Go.
- Yeah.

1:09:54.377 --> 1:09:57.774
and I call to the moon

1:10:11.454 --> 1:10:12.454
- What's up.

1:10:14.116 --> 1:10:15.817
- I need to be leaving.

1:10:15.817 --> 1:10:17.317
- I half expected.

1:10:18.697 --> 1:10:20.035
You haven't even had a chance to listen

1:10:20.035 --> 1:10:22.057
to what I've done with the songs.

1:10:22.057 --> 1:10:23.956
- I'm sure they're amazing.

1:10:23.956 --> 1:10:25.433
- When are you leaving?

1:10:25.433 --> 1:10:26.766
- Today.
- Today?

1:10:28.274 --> 1:10:30.153
I was hoping you'd be able to add

1:10:30.153 --> 1:10:32.436
some of your magic to them.

1:10:32.436 --> 1:10:33.673
- Next time.

1:10:33.673 --> 1:10:35.390
- And when will that be?

1:10:35.390 --> 1:10:36.890
Another two years?

1:10:38.356 --> 1:10:40.254
- I hope not.

1:10:40.254 --> 1:10:41.087
- Me too.

1:10:42.537 --> 1:10:44.494
It's been great to see you.

1:10:44.494 --> 1:10:45.327
- You too.

1:10:46.494 --> 1:10:51.257
- Come again any time.
It's your place, after all.

1:10:51.257 --> 1:10:54.007
- No, it's yours. It's your place

1:11:15.177 --> 1:11:16.788
- Peter.

1:11:16.788 --> 1:11:18.228
- Hmm?

1:11:18.228 --> 1:11:19.061
Hey.

1:11:20.426 --> 1:11:22.388
- You look awful.

1:11:22.388 --> 1:11:24.055
- Thanks. I feel it.

1:11:25.487 --> 1:11:28.671
- Did you sleep here last night?

1:11:28.671 --> 1:11:29.671
- I saw him.

1:11:30.602 --> 1:11:33.626
I got hammered over at the pub.

1:11:33.626 --> 1:11:36.153
That's where he's staying.

1:11:36.153 --> 1:11:38.804
I passed out in the garden.

1:11:38.804 --> 1:11:41.172
When I woke up, he was looking over me,

1:11:41.172 --> 1:11:43.550
holding a candlestick.

1:11:43.550 --> 1:11:45.892
Chased me off the property.

1:11:45.892 --> 1:11:48.309
- Jesus. Peter, you're crazy.

1:11:49.689 --> 1:11:51.189
- Crazy about you.

1:11:53.631 --> 1:11:55.714
I deleted all the photos.

1:11:57.365 --> 1:12:00.009
I'm not doing this anymore.

1:12:00.009 --> 1:12:04.592
I wanna take pictures of
trees and greenery and nature.

1:12:06.089 --> 1:12:08.772
And you, if you'll let me.

1:12:08.772 --> 1:12:11.330
I'm done with this game.

1:12:11.330 --> 1:12:15.172
- Yeah, well, glad as I am to hear that,

1:12:15.172 --> 1:12:18.506
you shouldn't do it
just because I tell you.

1:12:18.506 --> 1:12:19.339
- Look.

1:12:21.023 --> 1:12:23.356
It's my decision, obviously.

1:12:24.505 --> 1:12:27.305
But you've influenced that as well.

1:12:27.305 --> 1:12:32.148
You were right. If he wants
to be dead, let him be dead.

1:12:32.148 --> 1:12:35.815
It's not right for me
to unearth him, right?

1:12:38.344 --> 1:12:39.725
- Coffee?

1:12:39.725 --> 1:12:42.142
- Yeah. Make it a strong one.

1:12:56.865 --> 1:12:58.758
- Why is his phone-

1:12:58.758 --> 1:13:00.508
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:13:02.135 --> 1:13:02.968
Jack? Hi.

1:13:05.196 --> 1:13:07.014
I'm good. Can you hear me now?

1:13:07.014 --> 1:13:08.999
I've been calling you forever.

1:13:08.999 --> 1:13:10.700
What's up with your phone? Yeah.

1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:12.833
Ah, it's good, it's
good, it's good, it's good.

1:13:12.833 --> 1:13:14.138
- Where are you?
- I'm in Brighton.

1:13:14.138 --> 1:13:15.160
I'm in Brighton.

1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:17.869
- That's like miles away.
We're gonna miss the plane.

1:13:17.869 --> 1:13:20.720
Nah, we got plenty of time.

1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:22.320
They'll wait for us.

1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:23.840
- Can you hear me now?

1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:24.757
What?

1:13:24.757 --> 1:13:25.828
You're breaking up on me.
- Hello?

1:13:25.828 --> 1:13:27.137
- I can't hear ya.

1:13:27.137 --> 1:13:28.054
- Oh, Jack!

1:13:32.668 --> 1:13:33.501
Really?

1:14:04.157 --> 1:14:06.132
What are you doing?

1:14:06.132 --> 1:14:07.671
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1:14:07.671 --> 1:14:08.504
- Come on.

1:14:09.516 --> 1:14:10.349
Hi.
- Hi.

1:14:12.934 --> 1:14:13.777
- How are you?

1:14:18.973 --> 1:14:20.050
- Hi, Dad.

1:14:20.050 --> 1:14:20.913
Hello, my darling.

1:14:20.913 --> 1:14:22.470
- Yeah.
- So?

1:14:22.470 --> 1:14:23.750
- Yeah, I fixed it.

1:14:23.750 --> 1:14:26.926
Penelope, you're a star.

1:14:26.926 --> 1:14:28.798
- Dave. Yeah, I got something for you.

1:14:28.798 --> 1:14:31.662
Or something for us, actually.
It's a big, big story.

1:14:31.662 --> 1:14:34.242
But I need to remain in the shadows.

1:14:34.242 --> 1:14:37.282
I found Brian Corner. The Brian Corner.

1:14:37.282 --> 1:14:39.637
I've got plenty of evidence.

1:14:39.637 --> 1:14:41.459
And he's alive and well.

1:14:41.459 --> 1:14:43.215
But here's the hitch.

1:14:43.215 --> 1:14:46.520
I can't take credit for any
of the photos, or be involved.

1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:48.584
I need you to do that.

1:14:48.584 --> 1:14:51.102
If I tell you why, I'll have to kill you.

1:14:51.102 --> 1:14:54.435
I'll be back in London tomorrow. See ya.

1:15:03.599 --> 1:15:06.422
- I've been calling you forever.
What's up with your phone?

1:15:07.769 --> 1:15:10.665
- Oh. So where did you call me from?

1:15:12.667 --> 1:15:15.611
- Ah. Does this thing even work?

1:15:15.611 --> 1:15:16.944
- Apparently so.

1:15:20.967 --> 1:15:24.347
- I was beginning to
think you wouldn't come.

1:15:24.347 --> 1:15:27.264
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1:15:28.544 --> 1:15:32.208
- So I was thinking before you came.

1:15:32.208 --> 1:15:33.611
I don't know what to call you.

1:15:33.611 --> 1:15:35.632
I mean, Jack isn't really your name.

1:15:35.632 --> 1:15:39.167
That's what I've been calling you.

1:15:39.167 --> 1:15:40.917
Can I call you Brian?

1:15:42.164 --> 1:15:43.581
I'd prefer Brian.

1:15:44.586 --> 1:15:46.003
I'll be discreet.

1:15:47.044 --> 1:15:50.004
- I'd rather you didn't mention his name.

1:15:50.004 --> 1:15:51.423
- It is who you are.

1:15:51.423 --> 1:15:52.440
- Not anymore.

1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:55.122
- How am I supposed to introduce
you to friends and family?

1:15:55.122 --> 1:15:56.502
- Jack.
- Jack?

1:15:56.502 --> 1:15:57.335
- Jack.

1:16:00.061 --> 1:16:02.722
- I guess it makes sense.

1:16:02.722 --> 1:16:06.840
But why Jack? Why did you
choose to call yourself Jack?

1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:09.058
- Jack is a very good friend of mine.

1:16:09.058 --> 1:16:11.141
He's my partner in crime.

1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:15.080
I use his identity to make things easier.

1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:17.080
You'll meet him someday.

1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:24.701
- I see. Where is Jack?

1:16:24.701 --> 1:16:27.136
- Sussex. I was just visiting him.

1:16:27.136 --> 1:16:30.636
- I thought you were visiting your sister.

1:16:32.141 --> 1:16:33.519
- I lied.

1:16:33.519 --> 1:16:35.581
- Why did you lie again?

1:16:35.581 --> 1:16:37.538
- Because if I told you the truth,

1:16:37.538 --> 1:16:39.394
then I would've had to
tell you the whole truth,

1:16:39.394 --> 1:16:42.514
and you wouldn't have believed me anyway.

1:16:42.514 --> 1:16:45.931
I figured I'd spare us both a long story.

1:16:49.396 --> 1:16:50.498
- I usually don't like liars,

1:16:50.498 --> 1:16:54.248
but I guess in this case
I can understand it.

1:16:56.397 --> 1:16:59.196
- I thought you'd understand.

1:16:59.196 --> 1:17:02.578
- Anyway, we better hurry up.
We're gonna miss the plane.

1:17:02.578 --> 1:17:04.503
- Don't I have time to get a pint?

1:17:04.503 --> 1:17:05.753
- No. Let's go.

1:17:10.802 --> 1:17:11.969
- Hi, my love.

1:17:15.223 --> 1:17:16.730
Uh.

1:17:16.730 --> 1:17:17.964
Huh.

1:17:17.964 --> 1:17:20.631
A light sleeper all of a sudden?

1:17:24.524 --> 1:17:26.503
You can't fool me.

1:17:26.503 --> 1:17:27.336
Wake up.

1:17:28.335 --> 1:17:30.002
- Oh! Don't do that!

1:17:30.838 --> 1:17:33.158
Get your stuff and get out.

1:17:33.158 --> 1:17:33.991
- What?

1:17:35.233 --> 1:17:37.532
- Get out. I'm serious.

1:17:37.532 --> 1:17:39.476
- I've got some incredible news for us.

1:17:39.476 --> 1:17:42.561
- Oh God, what now? I can't wait.

1:17:42.561 --> 1:17:45.075
- We're rich. We're rich, we're rich.

1:17:45.075 --> 1:17:47.673
I found him. I got closeup photos of him.

1:17:47.673 --> 1:17:50.612
I even met him in person.
It's definitely him.

1:17:50.612 --> 1:17:52.473
- Can you mention that man's name again?

1:17:52.473 --> 1:17:54.249
- It's just one more day, tomorrow.

1:17:54.249 --> 1:17:55.929
- I'm going meeting Andrew in town.

1:17:55.929 --> 1:17:57.428
He's gonna give me a little advance.

1:17:57.428 --> 1:17:59.744
He thinks I should sell each
photo to the highest bidder.

1:17:59.744 --> 1:18:02.506
It's exciting stuff. Hey?

1:18:02.506 --> 1:18:03.339
Let me take you for lunch.

1:18:03.339 --> 1:18:05.679
You can go anywhere you
wanna go. You name it.

1:18:05.679 --> 1:18:09.077
Hmm? You name it, we'll go there.

1:18:09.077 --> 1:18:12.454
- Well, even if it is
true, that's a big if,

1:18:12.454 --> 1:18:15.278
it doesn't change anything.

1:18:15.278 --> 1:18:16.918
- It's definite.

1:18:16.918 --> 1:18:19.840
It's definite, and it changes everything.

1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:20.921
- There's always something with you.

1:18:20.921 --> 1:18:23.285
I've heard it all before.

1:18:23.285 --> 1:18:26.282
What are you talking about?

1:18:26.282 --> 1:18:28.250
- OK, let me see the photos.

1:18:28.250 --> 1:18:29.472
Might be better than the ones you took

1:18:29.472 --> 1:18:30.904
of the back of his head.

1:18:30.904 --> 1:18:33.987
- Yeah, OK, well, I'll just
upload them to the computer, OK?

1:18:33.987 --> 1:18:35.987
I need to delete a couple of them.

1:18:35.987 --> 1:18:37.987
- Why do you need to delete them?

1:18:37.987 --> 1:18:39.578
Have you got something to hide?

1:18:39.578 --> 1:18:42.820
Is that why you didn't pick
up your phone for days on end?

1:18:42.820 --> 1:18:45.396
- I was on a stakeout.

1:18:45.396 --> 1:18:48.122
That's why I had my phone off.

1:18:48.122 --> 1:18:49.562
- No, it wasn't. It rang.

1:18:49.562 --> 1:18:52.223
- I thought you didn't wanna
talk about him anymore.

1:18:52.223 --> 1:18:54.084
- Show me the photos.

1:18:54.084 --> 1:18:56.260
- All right, just give me a
chance to back it up on my.

1:18:56.260 --> 1:18:58.785
Hey, hey, give it, give it to me.

1:18:58.785 --> 1:18:59.673
Give 'em here. Give it here.

1:18:59.673 --> 1:19:01.976
- No, if you haven't got anything to hide,

1:19:01.976 --> 1:19:03.893
I wanna see the photos.

1:19:05.176 --> 1:19:07.094
- Look, it's just, I
wanted to delete a few,

1:19:07.094 --> 1:19:09.437
'cause I wanted you to
see the best ones, OK?

1:19:09.437 --> 1:19:10.994
You know, you're always
so critical of what I do.

1:19:10.994 --> 1:19:12.354
I don't like it.

1:19:12.354 --> 1:19:14.104
- Really? Is that so?

1:19:15.096 --> 1:19:15.929
- Yeah.

1:19:17.993 --> 1:19:19.960
- I wanna see the photos.

1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:22.900
I won't be so overly
judgmental if they're so good.

1:19:22.900 --> 1:19:24.983
- Listen.
- I'm listening.

1:19:26.193 --> 1:19:28.943
- I met someone when I was there.

1:19:32.534 --> 1:19:33.367
- Who?

1:19:34.555 --> 1:19:37.747
- Just a woman. Just to
help me find Brian Corner.

1:19:37.747 --> 1:19:42.568
She stayed in a place just
round the corner from him.

1:19:42.568 --> 1:19:45.229
We went to a park, a graveyard.
I got a few photos of her.

1:19:45.229 --> 1:19:48.845
I just didn't want you to see
them and think anything of it.

1:19:48.845 --> 1:19:51.565
- Really? And what kind of photos?

1:19:51.565 --> 1:19:53.585
- Just in a park, a graveyard,

1:19:53.585 --> 1:19:55.725
and a couple at her house, that's all.

1:19:55.725 --> 1:19:57.725
- A couple at her house?

1:20:00.445 --> 1:20:03.149
How serious was this relationship?

1:20:03.149 --> 1:20:06.420
- It's nothing. I was only using
her to get to Brian Corner.

1:20:06.420 --> 1:20:07.626
As soon as I found out she wasn't helpful,

1:20:07.626 --> 1:20:09.543
I came back to you, OK?

1:20:10.441 --> 1:20:13.845
- Really? How exactly did she help you?

1:20:13.845 --> 1:20:16.345
- Well, as it turned out,
she wasn't very helpful.

1:20:16.345 --> 1:20:19.146
You just thought
she might be helpful?

1:20:19.146 --> 1:20:21.583
- Pretty much, yeah.

1:20:21.583 --> 1:20:24.406
- Well, I wanna see what she looks like.

1:20:24.406 --> 1:20:25.906
- OK, if you must.

1:20:28.767 --> 1:20:30.684
- I don't see anything.

1:20:33.427 --> 1:20:34.344
No SD card.

1:20:36.126 --> 1:20:36.959
- What?

1:20:40.206 --> 1:20:42.539
It was definitely, it was
in there. It was in there.

1:20:42.539 --> 1:20:44.311
I only ever take it out to
back it up on the computer.

1:20:44.311 --> 1:20:45.708
It was definitely fucking in there.

1:20:45.708 --> 1:20:49.804
- You must've put it somewhere
else. It can't just fly away.

1:20:49.804 --> 1:20:51.884
- The fucking bitch must've taken it.

1:20:51.884 --> 1:20:53.207
Who?

1:20:53.207 --> 1:20:56.764
- Penelope, the girl I was
just telling you about.

1:20:56.764 --> 1:20:58.910
- Why would she do that?

1:20:58.910 --> 1:21:02.140
- Why do you think? She
obviously saw some worth in it.

1:21:02.140 --> 1:21:03.583
- Are you sure you just
haven't put it somewhere else?

1:21:03.583 --> 1:21:05.833
- No, she fucking stole it.

1:21:06.911 --> 1:21:08.085
How could she have done that?

1:21:08.085 --> 1:21:11.903
- Aw, 'cause I trusted her, stupidly.

1:21:11.903 --> 1:21:14.687
I let her take a few photos.

1:21:14.687 --> 1:21:19.103
Oh, fuck. She must've taken
it when I was in the bathroom.

1:21:19.103 --> 1:21:21.946
- I thought you left
once you got the photos.

1:21:21.946 --> 1:21:23.863
- Ah, not straightaway.

1:21:26.222 --> 1:21:28.639
- You're changing your story.

1:21:29.887 --> 1:21:32.266
Get your stuff and get out.

1:21:32.266 --> 1:21:33.786
I'm finished with your lies.

1:21:33.786 --> 1:21:34.869
Unbelievable.

1:21:37.487 --> 1:21:38.320
- Ugh.

1:21:39.706 --> 1:21:40.539
Ah!

1:21:41.498 --> 1:21:42.331
Fuck.

1:21:48.215 --> 1:21:49.882
I'm gonna cry. Fuck!

1:21:54.772 --> 1:21:56.156
Bitch.

1:21:56.156 --> 1:21:59.323
Ah, I can't fucking believe it. Jesus.

1:22:01.356 --> 1:22:02.939
Shit. Stupid woman.

1:22:07.401 --> 1:22:08.234
Fuck!

1:22:16.217 --> 1:22:20.300
- Oh, and remind me, I
need to pick a new SD card

1:22:21.213 --> 1:22:23.548
from the terminal for my camera.

1:22:23.548 --> 1:22:24.698
- SD card? I got one of those.

1:22:24.698 --> 1:22:26.938
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1:22:26.938 --> 1:22:28.105
- That's good.

1:22:30.947 --> 1:22:31.780
Thanks.

1:22:32.647 --> 1:22:35.578
PP. Why does it have PP on it?

1:22:38.695 --> 1:22:39.890
- I'll tell you when we
get to the penthouse.

1:22:39.890 --> 1:22:41.938
- Hey, you've been practicing.

1:22:41.938 --> 1:22:45.053
- Well, yeah. You gotta
help me out, though.

1:23:35.328 --> 1:23:37.919
they could reel a man
