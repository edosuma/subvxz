00:01.335 --> 00:03.086
Hey.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.756
I brought you some breakfast
as a peace offering.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.675
Food here is a little tricky.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.636
It's just a closet full of beef jerky.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.305
Apparently, Macho Man Randy Savage
was an alum here,

00:13.388 --> 00:17.267
and he left his entire food supply
to Ron in his will, so,

00:17.351 --> 00:20.562
snap into a Slim Jim?

00:20.646 --> 00:22.314
- Care to join me for breakfast?

00:22.397 --> 00:24.149
- Of course.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.194
Jerky for two.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.447
Um... look,

00:30.531 --> 00:33.700
I wanted to apologize.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.702
You know, I didn't mean to...
- Stab me?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.579
- Well, I wasn't gonna use those words.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.040
Look, Ron-Ron is crazy.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.668
I'm serious. He's-he's nuts.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.628
Sick-in-the-head crazy.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.172
And I'm convinced that
that motherfucker killed

00:47.256 --> 00:48.674
a dude named Rodrigo.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.133
And the motherfucker tried to kill me

00:50.217 --> 00:51.927
just for being around his office.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.097
And as far as your arm goes,
I know you think I'm lying...

00:55.180 --> 00:56.515
I heard "retractable."

00:56.598 --> 00:58.976
- You know, I've dated guys
like you before.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.811
It's always someone else's fault.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.729
- That's not true.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.648
That's not true at all.
When I'm wrong, I...

01:04.731 --> 01:06.608
I shouldn't say that
'cause I'm never wrong.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.402
If... if I'm wrong,

01:08.485 --> 01:10.529
I have no problem
admitting that I'm wrong.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.991
But in this case, I'm not.
He said "retractable."

01:14.074 --> 01:17.953
- Hey, part of me is glad you stabbed me.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.163
It's a badge of honor.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.833
I heard when Jason Statham
came through here,

01:22.916 --> 01:24.877
he got stabbed directly in the heart.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.170
- Did he survive that?

01:26.253 --> 01:28.338
- He shot Transporter, like, a week later.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.215
- What the fuck?

01:30.299 --> 01:31.925
In the heart?
They stabbed him in the heart?

01:32.009 --> 01:33.927
- Yep, right through it.
- Goddamn it.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.263
Maybe I'm just doing
the wrong fucking thing here.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.223
I mean...

01:38.307 --> 01:40.601
...maybe this just isn't for me, you know?

01:40.684 --> 01:42.561
- So, just leave.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.813
Go home.
I'm sure there's

01:44.897 --> 01:47.191
a real hero somewhere in need
of a goofy sidekick.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.817
- Okay, uh, that backfired.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.694
I thought that you would go
the opposite direction

01:50.777 --> 01:52.988
and tell me that, no, I should stay,

01:53.071 --> 01:55.157
and that this is for me.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.658
That's what I... thought...

01:56.742 --> 01:58.160
- Well, what do you want me to say?

01:58.243 --> 02:00.662
If you need extra motivation
to be the star

02:00.746 --> 02:03.040
of a Claude Van De Velde movie...

02:03.123 --> 02:05.042
uh, you're in the wrong business.

02:05.125 --> 02:09.379
This is probably my only shot
to be a big action star, so

02:09.463 --> 02:11.381
I'm not gonna blow it.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.300
I'll do anything it takes.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.014
- You're right.

02:19.097 --> 02:22.351
You are absolutely right.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.770
I need to stop
all the bitching and moaning,

02:24.853 --> 02:26.647
and I need to cowboy the fuck up.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.525
- There you go.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.659
- When I first started in the business,

02:38.742 --> 02:40.369
training action stars,

02:40.452 --> 02:42.788
every stunt scene was practical.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.958
Or, as Kevin might say, "retractable."

02:46.041 --> 02:47.835
- Oh, that's really good.
That's great.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.295
It's not funny.
- But the industry has changed.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.506
You can't even be an action star without,

02:52.589 --> 02:54.007
well, knowing how to work green.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.468
- Uh, I'm very familiar
with the green screen.

02:56.552 --> 02:57.886
I mean, I've done about 15 movies

02:57.970 --> 02:59.680
where we've had a green screen.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.140
- In which of those 15 movies
were you the leading man?

03:02.224 --> 03:04.768
Any idiot can jump on a green screen

03:04.852 --> 03:07.604
and pretend to be eaten by a CG dragon.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.314
Hell, even Little Kevin can do that.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.774
- Oh, hell no!

03:10.858 --> 03:13.402
- Okay, who's finding the time
to dress him like me?

03:13.485 --> 03:15.070
It's really...
- Okay, question.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.781
What does a leading woman or a leading man

03:17.865 --> 03:20.951
get to do on-screen that sidekicks don't?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.036
- Win fights.
- Uh, murder bad guys.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.413
- Make love.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.791
Today's lesson is in lovemaking.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.126
- Yes!

03:29.209 --> 03:30.377
On the green screen?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.045
Are we doing it on the green screen?

03:32.129 --> 03:33.547
- Bingo.
- Nice.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.758
Adding effects to the bed,
to the wall, just cracking 'em.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.135
- Okay, I'm gonna be candid.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.429
I-I don't want to do a sex scene with him.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.430
- That's fine, 'cause I don't want

03:41.513 --> 03:42.973
to do a sex scene with her. Ugh.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.772
What's so funny?
- Okay, well, look at you,

03:50.856 --> 03:52.316
and then look at her.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.318
And look at you, then her.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.236
Then you, then her.
- Okay.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.530
I don't get the joke. What is...?
What-what am I missing?

03:58.614 --> 04:00.532
- All right, let me
put it another way. Uh...

04:00.616 --> 04:02.743
Look at you, and then look at her.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.037
Then look at you, and then her.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.956
- Can we just get
this shit over with, please?

04:08.040 --> 04:10.167
- Okay, let's discuss motivation.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.169
All right, now...

04:12.252 --> 04:13.921
after almost killing each other,

04:14.004 --> 04:15.964
Agent Hart and Agent King

04:16.048 --> 04:17.716
discover that they're on the same team.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.760
After diffusing a bomb,

04:19.843 --> 04:21.178
at the top of a skyscraper,

04:21.261 --> 04:23.180
in-in the middle of an earthquake,

04:23.263 --> 04:26.975
they discover this overwhelming passion
for each other.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.938
- Wait, wait, wait. We-We're
at the top of a skyscraper

04:31.021 --> 04:32.272
in the middle of an earthquake?

04:32.356 --> 04:34.066
- Yes! Yes! Goddamn it!

04:34.149 --> 04:36.860
You are the dumbest actor
that I've ever worked with!

04:36.944 --> 04:38.612
Go! Action!

04:38.695 --> 04:42.199
Red wire... or blue wire?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.201
- It's got to be the red.
- Are you sure?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.494
Agent Hart, are you sure?

04:45.577 --> 04:47.412
- I don't know.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.731
- Earthquake. Earthquake!

05:14.815 --> 05:16.149
The building's falling apart!

05:16.233 --> 05:18.235
- Oh, okay, um...
- Oh, okay.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.653
- Good, great.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.780
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

05:21.864 --> 05:23.407
Oh, shit!

05:23.490 --> 05:26.159
Hold on! Wait! Oh!

05:26.243 --> 05:28.161
Where you at?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.- Kevin.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.539
- Hold on, wait,
give me a second! Shit!

05:30.622 --> 05:32.165
- Okay.
- Okay, all right.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.917
Come on, it's an earthquake.
It's an earthquake.

05:34.001 --> 05:34.918
Go.
- Yeah.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.461
- Go.
- Agent Hart,

05:36.545 --> 05:38.630
I can't believe
we just diffused that bomb.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.175
We just saved thousands
of lives, maybe millions.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.303
- This earthquake's got to be
about a 7.5 magnitude.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.890
This could be our last time
being together before we die.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.809
- Now kiss her neck softly
and start fucking.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.061
- What...? Wait.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.272
Kiss-kiss her neck and then start fucking?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.733
- Kiss her neck softly and start fucking!

05:57.816 --> 05:59.985
- Oh, okay. He...
- Uh...

06:00.068 --> 06:01.570
- I'm just gonna do it
'cause that's what he s...

06:01.653 --> 06:03.488
- Yeah, no, it's fine.
- Yeah, let me put your...

06:03.572 --> 06:06.283
Give me that.
- Be sexy! Do something!

06:06.366 --> 06:08.076
- Grab my leg.
- Okay, give me this one.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.205
- Have you never had sex before?!
Do it!

06:11.288 --> 06:13.165
- That's not...
- We need... All right.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.416
One second. That's it.
- I think we got it.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.251
- Go! Go!

06:16.335 --> 06:18.629
- Agent Hart, no.
We shouldn't do this.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.381
It's against Bureau protocol.

06:21.465 --> 06:24.635
- Well, protocol was meant to be broken.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.226
Help! Help! Don't drop me!
Don't drop me!

06:32.309 --> 06:33.810
Please don't let go!
Don't let go!

06:33.894 --> 06:35.729
- I won't! I got you!
- Don't let go!

06:35.812 --> 06:37.105
- I've got you, I promise!

06:37.189 --> 06:39.316
- Can you push in a little closer?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.776
- Help me! Help me!

06:40.859 --> 06:42.444
I'm too young to die!

06:42.528 --> 06:44.696
- Any closer, they'll see the cameras.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.323
- Okay, good. Hold there.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.659
- I got you.
- Perfect.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.911
- Help!
- Kevin, you're, like, one foot

06:50.994 --> 06:53.747
off the ground.
- You cannot teach acting like that.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.290
- I'm just gonna let you down, okay?

06:55.374 --> 06:56.708
- Aah!
