00:02.741 --> 00:05.135
So I've only been a foster
mom for a few weeks now,

00:05.179 --> 00:06.745
but it's true
what they say:

00:06.789 --> 00:08.834
once you have a child,
it stops being about you,

00:08.878 --> 00:10.358
and it's all about them.

00:10.401 --> 00:13.143
Did you ever get
that feeling, Mommy?

00:15.232 --> 00:16.886
There's just this
one little thing she does

00:16.929 --> 00:18.409
that bothers the bejesus
out of me.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.629
I get that one
all the time.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.283
JILL: I've been
following her

00:22.326 --> 00:27.331
on Instagram under the pseudonym
"Ruby Peppers 647."

00:27.375 --> 00:30.465
She's constantly posting selfies
with me in the background.

00:30.508 --> 00:33.076
The other day,
I had a mud mask on

00:33.120 --> 00:35.731
and I was eating a banana.

00:35.774 --> 00:38.560
The next thing I know,
I'm something called a meme.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.825
Anyway, I'm really grateful
for these meetings

00:42.868 --> 00:44.479
so I have somewhere
to come and complain--

00:44.522 --> 00:48.439
I mean, share. Thank you.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.618
BRUCE: Would anyone
else like to share?

00:53.662 --> 00:55.925
I need to.
Wow.

00:55.968 --> 00:58.884
Ruby's really going to
town on that banana.

00:58.928 --> 01:02.671
That's years
of practice.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.586
Marjorie, alcoholic.

01:04.629 --> 01:05.935
ALL:
Hi, Marjorie.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.806
I apologize for
being late.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.460
[inhales deeply]

01:09.504 --> 01:10.983
I don't even know
where to start.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.333
I'm just so upset.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.771
My sponsor relapsed.

01:15.814 --> 01:18.948
52 years she
was sober.

01:18.991 --> 01:23.126
This beautiful woman
who saved my life,

01:23.170 --> 01:28.000
been my rock ever since the day
I walked into these rooms.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.396
That she could just give up
and... [cries]

01:34.790 --> 01:37.488
[crying]:
I'm sorry.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.142
Oh, my God.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.448
It's just awful.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.102
Really?

01:42.145 --> 01:44.104
What I'm hearing is after
52 years of sobriety,

01:44.147 --> 01:45.931
we get to drink again.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.329
Something terrible
must have happened

01:52.373 --> 01:54.157
for her to start
drinking again.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.245
She getting divorced?

01:55.289 --> 01:56.420
Did someone die?

01:56.464 --> 01:58.553
Her neighbor cut down her hedge.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.165
Sorry, what?

02:02.209 --> 02:05.255
There was a shared hedge
between the houses,

02:05.299 --> 02:08.606
neighbor cut it down,
she got loaded that night.

02:08.650 --> 02:12.436
Help me out here.
Was the hedge made of gold?

02:12.480 --> 02:14.699
Everything I've done
to stay sober,

02:14.743 --> 02:16.223
I learned from her.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.095
Then, in a second, she
just threw it all away.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.966
I mean, are we talking
one of those hedges

02:21.010 --> 02:22.968
shaped like an
elephant or something?

02:23.012 --> 02:25.754
I didn't see the damn hedge,
Bonnie.

02:25.797 --> 02:29.061
And that's called
a topiary.

02:29.105 --> 02:32.239
I always thought when I had a
couple of decades under my belt,

02:32.282 --> 02:34.502
I wouldn't even think
about drinking anymore.

02:34.545 --> 02:37.635
Good Lord, I have
a lot of hedges.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.115
MARJORIE:
Ladies.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.205
It obviously wasn't about
the hedge.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.642
Yeah, guys.
Come on, pay attention.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.384
You know what?

02:47.428 --> 02:49.473
I need to take a break
from all this.

02:49.517 --> 02:52.998
Maybe you guys can find
someone else to talk to.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.522
Excuse me.
Really?

02:54.565 --> 02:56.350
What are you saying?Oh, come on, Marjorie.

02:56.393 --> 02:57.786
Who am I supposed
to call?

02:57.829 --> 03:00.180
[sighs]

03:01.920 --> 03:04.662
What am I supposed to do? I
check in with her every day.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.230
Me, too.
I run everything by her.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.840
[sighs]

03:08.884 --> 03:10.407
Okay. I know
where this is headed,

03:10.451 --> 03:14.324
and yes, you can all come to me
with your problems.

03:14.368 --> 03:18.067
Oh, God. We're
all gonna die.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.025

03:36.085 --> 03:38.609
[cricket chirps]

03:38.653 --> 03:41.177
[chirping continues]

03:41.221 --> 03:44.354
[groans]:
Oh, stop taunting me!

03:44.398 --> 03:47.357
Look, Wendy, it's not
your coworker's job

03:47.401 --> 03:49.011
to be your friend.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.622
Calm down,
take a deep breath in...

03:51.666 --> 03:53.972
What are you doing?
Oh...

03:54.016 --> 03:56.584
we've got a cricket in the
house, it's driving me crazy.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.194
I told you, we need screens.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.240
You're the building manager,
put 'em in.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.545
You know the procedure.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.417
You need to submit
a written request.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.898
Ooh. And exhale.

04:09.379 --> 04:12.208
Okay. Call me back when
you stop feeling dizzy.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.819
Wendy actually called you
for guidance?

04:14.863 --> 04:17.560
I'll have you know, I have been
putting out fires all day.

04:17.605 --> 04:21.738
Jill, boom. Mary, boom.
Wendy, boom.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.133
The boom is the problem
being solved.

04:24.176 --> 04:27.049
You sure it's not the sound
of their lives blowing up?

04:28.355 --> 04:29.094
[cricket chirps]

04:30.226 --> 04:31.880
In the meantime,

04:31.923 --> 04:33.490
I'm really worried
about Marjorie.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.144
I've never seen her this upset.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.624
She'll be fine.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.626
And if she's not,
she can call me, boom.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.629
You want to help me
find this thing?

04:41.672 --> 04:44.371
Sorry. I'm Team Cricket.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.243
[ringtone plays]

04:47.287 --> 04:49.245
Hey, Jill.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.248
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.945
Okay, stop talking.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.687
Let me tell you
what I used to do

04:56.731 --> 04:58.341
when Christy was a teenager.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.604
Wave at me through Plexiglas?

05:02.824 --> 05:04.608
[cricket chirps]

05:04.652 --> 05:06.697
Where are you, you bastard?

05:08.699 --> 05:10.745
Make it fast, Wendy,
I'm working.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.617
All the nurses in my unit
are going out to lunch

05:13.661 --> 05:15.010
and they didn't invite me.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.794
[scoffs]
Did you consider that maybe

05:16.838 --> 05:19.275
they want to say nice things
about you behind your back?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.582
Really? That's the best you got?

05:21.625 --> 05:23.453
I could tell you the truth,

05:23.497 --> 05:25.542
but you're too weak
and neurotic to handle it.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.720
[phone chimes]Got to go,
Jill's on the other line.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.200
Hey, Money.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.811
Bonnie, I am in crisis.

05:33.855 --> 05:36.510
How can you be in crisis?
We talked 20 minutes ago.

05:36.553 --> 05:39.774
Emily just left for school
and she was wearing a necktie.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.777
Please do not tell me
you're worried she's gay.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.257
No! I'm just worried
she's got no style

05:45.301 --> 05:46.911
and that reflects on me.

05:46.955 --> 05:50.393
Jill, have you seen the way
my daughter dresses?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.787
Yes, and I judge you for it.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.919
[phone chimes]

05:54.963 --> 05:57.444
Sorry, got to go.
Crybaby's back for more.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.010
What?

05:59.054 --> 06:01.665
I just found out the lunch
is a birthday party.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.841
They didn't even ask me
to sign the card.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.758
All right. You got to stop
focusing on yourself.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.673
Get out of your head.
Help someone else.

06:09.717 --> 06:10.761
Who can I help?

06:10.805 --> 06:12.284
You're in an emergency room!

06:12.328 --> 06:13.764
Follow a trail of blood.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.985
Uh...

06:17.028 --> 06:19.422
CHRISTY: I got it!
I got it, I got it!
What?

06:19.466 --> 06:20.641
The cricket.
Open the door.

06:20.684 --> 06:21.859
Just kill it.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.513
No, that's bad karma.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.081
I'm releasing it
back into the wild.

06:26.124 --> 06:28.039
Be free, little...

06:28.083 --> 06:29.650
Where'd it go?! I had it!

06:29.693 --> 06:30.999
[cricket chirps in house]

06:31.042 --> 06:33.567
How'd he do that?!

06:41.052 --> 06:42.053
Hi.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.664
Ugh.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.535
Back at ya.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.711
We just came by to see
how Marjorie's doing.

06:47.755 --> 06:51.149
She's still
sad. Good-bye.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.542
We blew 12 bucks on the plant.

06:52.586 --> 06:53.935
We want to see
the body, old man.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.851
Thank you, good-bye.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.812
"Let's not call,
let's just show up."

07:04.032 --> 07:04.989
Who was that?

07:05.033 --> 07:07.252
Florist.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.037
I bought you plant.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.736
Oh...

07:12.780 --> 07:14.912
Mary, I know it looks like
I'm checking my e-mail,

07:14.956 --> 07:16.479
but I'm listening,
go ahead.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.307
Okay. My sister--

07:18.350 --> 07:21.745
well, I call her my sister,
but she's actually my mom.

07:21.789 --> 07:25.009
All right,
now I'm really listening.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.490
It's weird being here
without Marjorie.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.187
I was really hoping
she'd come tonight.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.841
Yeah, me, too.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.800
I'm not sure Bonnie
knows what she's doing.

07:32.843 --> 07:35.019
Oh, hear me
and hear me well,

07:35.063 --> 07:37.065
she does not.

07:37.108 --> 07:40.111
Oh, hello, cute,

07:40.155 --> 07:41.330
dark and sober.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.421
Oh, God.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.640
What's the matter?

07:46.683 --> 07:48.250
You know that guy?

07:48.293 --> 07:49.991
A long time ago.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.167
So what? He's an
old boyfriend?

07:52.210 --> 07:54.517
He's definitely not
an old boyfriend.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.084
I-I got to go.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.879

here till you talk to us.

Oh, hell.

I don't have any plans.

And we all know
Wendy doesn't.

Hey.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.163
Thank you.

08:32.207 --> 08:33.948
What's going on?

08:33.991 --> 08:35.340
Yeah. Who was
that guy?

08:35.384 --> 08:37.778
[sighs]

08:40.823 --> 08:44.044
Back when I was drinking,
I was at this party,

08:44.087 --> 08:47.962
and that guy showed up
with some coke.

08:48.005 --> 08:51.835
We went into a bedroom
to do a few lines.

08:51.879 --> 08:55.099
Next thing I know,
he was on top of me,

08:55.143 --> 08:58.233
and I was too messed up
to fight him off.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.452
That son of a bitch.

09:00.496 --> 09:01.584
We know where he is.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.672
We should call the police.

09:02.716 --> 09:03.804
It was 16 years ago.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.109
There's nothing
they can do.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.415
What did they do back then?

09:06.458 --> 09:07.634
I didn't report it.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.331
It would have been
his word against mine.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.333
Who's gonna believe
a drunk stripper?

09:11.376 --> 09:14.031
[scoffs] Thank you very
much for ditching me.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.077
Way to treat the woman
who's been listening

09:16.120 --> 09:18.296
to your stupid
problems all week.

09:19.733 --> 09:20.734
What?

09:22.866 --> 09:24.738
Viceroy Lights
was at the meeting.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.174
Are you kidding me?

09:26.217 --> 09:27.392
Viceroy Lights?

09:27.436 --> 09:30.047
I never knew his name.
That's what he smoked.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.919
He's at the meeting now?
Tell me what he looks like.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.181
I'll go rip his throat out.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.226
No. I just want
to forget about it.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.314
You guys know who he is?

09:36.358 --> 09:37.359
Sit down!

09:37.402 --> 09:39.230
[sighs]

09:39.274 --> 09:42.059
I could just go back there and
punch every guy in that room.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.322
I'm sure they've all done
something to deserve it.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.323
Just drop it.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.153
I wish Marjorie was here.
She'd know what to do.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.764
Thank you, Wendy.
That's very hurtful.

09:52.461 --> 09:53.941
Well, then,
do you know what to do?

09:53.984 --> 09:55.420
There's nothing to do.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.468
[sighs]

09:59.511 --> 10:01.339
[cricket chirps]

10:01.383 --> 10:03.864
Honey, I think
you got a cricket.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.659
You doing all right?

10:16.703 --> 10:18.487
Yeah.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.968
If you want to
talk, I'm here.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.099
Don't need to.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.667
Okay.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.277
Are you sure?

10:26.321 --> 10:27.931
I think you need
to talk about it.

10:27.975 --> 10:31.021
Mom, it was a long time ago.
I'm fine.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.110
Yeah, but I wasn't there
for you a long time ago.

10:33.154 --> 10:34.677
Let me be here
for you now.
[sighs]

10:34.721 --> 10:38.420
You're here.
You're extremely here.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.030
Let's go to sleep.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.641
Going to sleep.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.127
What about Marjorie?

10:50.171 --> 10:51.476
Would you talk to her?

10:51.520 --> 10:54.262
She asked not to be bothered,
and unlike you,

10:54.305 --> 10:56.481
when someone tells me
not to bother them,

10:56.525 --> 10:57.874
I actually listen.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.659
No, you don't,
but that's all right.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.187
What about a therapist?

11:06.230 --> 11:08.668
That's not a bad idea.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.019
You should definitely see one.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.200
[sniffs]

11:21.593 --> 11:24.814
Ah, you little minx.
You're collecting twos.

11:24.858 --> 11:28.165
[ringtone plays]

11:28.209 --> 11:30.472
Mm, hang on, it's Christy.

11:30.515 --> 11:31.386
Ugh.

11:33.518 --> 11:34.911
Hey, sweetie. What's up?

11:34.955 --> 11:36.391
Nothing.

11:36.434 --> 11:39.263
Just wanted to check in,
see how you're doing.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.701
I'm okay. Are you okay?

11:41.744 --> 11:44.355
Yeah, it's just...

11:46.967 --> 11:49.752
Eh, the usual.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.928
Hate my job, hate my mom,
my kids hate me...

11:51.972 --> 11:54.452
You know, circle of life.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.716
Are you sure that's all?

11:58.805 --> 12:00.807
Yeah, I just miss you.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.679
I miss you, too.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.246
Did you like the plant
we dropped off?

12:12.732 --> 12:17.345
Yes, thank you. It's beautiful.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.913
Okay. Well, bye.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.349
Bye, sweetie.

12:25.266 --> 12:28.356
Why are you giving
me stink eye?

12:31.968 --> 12:33.404
[cricket chirps]

12:33.448 --> 12:34.971
Oh, you are so dead.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.236
Mary, I'm confused.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.065
Your sister is your mother,
and your brother's your uncle?

12:42.109 --> 12:44.546
Oh, he's just your brother.
Okay, got it.

12:44.589 --> 12:47.897
So, which one needs the kidney?

12:47.941 --> 12:51.379
Oh, my God!
I got to go.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.772
What happened?

12:55.426 --> 12:58.865
I can't find the cricket.
[sniffles]

13:00.605 --> 13:03.826
Don't. Don't touch me.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.785
[sniffles]

13:12.443 --> 13:15.185
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things...

13:15.229 --> 13:17.753
[knocks]
[screams]

13:19.886 --> 13:21.931
Bonnie!

13:21.975 --> 13:25.413
[sighs]
What the hell are you doing?

13:25.456 --> 13:27.850
I didn't want to go through
your Armenian bodyguard.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.156
What's wrong?

13:29.199 --> 13:30.374
I need your help.
Christy is falling apart.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.941
I don't know what to do.
Come on.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.856
Throw your leg over the ledge,
I'll help you out.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.771
I'm not going out the window.Yeah, you're right.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.207
If you break a hip,
you're no good to me.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.252
I'll meet you at the car.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.691
It doesn't matter
how drunk you were.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.998
What happened
wasn't your fault.

13:45.041 --> 13:48.436
But if I hadn't been drinking,
it wouldn't have happened.

13:48.479 --> 13:49.829
You don't know that.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.395
Yeah, you don't
know that.

13:51.439 --> 13:54.877
Is this what you meant by,
"I'll give you both some space"?

13:54.921 --> 13:57.097
Carry on.

13:57.140 --> 14:00.100
If my life hadn't been
such a train wreck,

14:00.143 --> 14:02.232
I might have done something
about it.

14:02.276 --> 14:05.888
Honey, it's okay to
look back at the past.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.585
Just don't stare
too long.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.849
Good one. I'm gonna use that
with my sponsees.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.330
[Bonnie scoffs]

14:13.374 --> 14:14.897
Kind of rude.

14:16.377 --> 14:19.467
You know, instead
of kicking yourself

14:19.510 --> 14:21.295
for not taking
action then,

14:21.338 --> 14:23.775
be grateful that
you're sober now

14:23.819 --> 14:25.212
and you have a voice.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.691
[sighs]

14:28.780 --> 14:31.261
I really hate this disease.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.784
Me, too.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.483
BONNIE:
Me, too.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.354
That's right, I'm still here.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.488
[sighs]

14:40.531 --> 14:42.664
I know you're dealing
with your own crap.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.796
I'm sorry
she dragged you over here.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.363
Oh, don't
worry about it.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.583
Besides, I needed
a break from Victor.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.846
He means well, and I
love him, but sometimes

14:50.890 --> 14:53.805
I feel like I'm living
with a James Bond villain.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.721
[Bonnie laughs]

14:59.855 --> 15:02.075
So, I was having a
little family dinner,

15:02.118 --> 15:04.468
and my sister-mother shows up...

15:04.512 --> 15:06.557
with a rum cake.

15:06.601 --> 15:07.950
So I said,

15:07.994 --> 15:09.952
"You know I can't have that."

15:09.996 --> 15:12.781
So she said, "Why should
the rest of us be penalized

15:12.824 --> 15:14.957
just because you can't
control yourself?"

15:15.001 --> 15:17.133
So I said, "Screw you."

15:17.177 --> 15:20.528
And, well, things got physical.

15:20.571 --> 15:24.184
I don't know how you
put up with these people.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.534
This one was probably
calling me ten times a day.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.492
Ten? After two,

15:28.536 --> 15:31.582
I tell them to deal
with it and hang up.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.455
You can do that?

15:34.498 --> 15:36.022
MARY: Anyway, long
story short,

15:36.065 --> 15:38.502
she took out a
restraining order on me.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.461
Imagine that.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.680
Against her own
sister-daughter.

15:42.724 --> 15:46.380
Well, all right. Thanks
for letting me share.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.251
It's nice to be in a room

15:48.295 --> 15:50.427
where none of this seems
so weird. [chuckles]

15:52.908 --> 15:56.216
BRUCE: Does anyone
else want to share?

15:56.259 --> 15:57.565
I'll go.

16:05.225 --> 16:08.489
Hi, I'm Christy,
and I'm an alcoholic.

16:08.532 --> 16:11.535
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

16:11.579 --> 16:14.712
[sighs] I'm so nervous,
I'm gonna say that part again.

16:14.756 --> 16:18.020
Hi, I'm Christy,
I'm an alcoholic.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.022
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

16:20.066 --> 16:24.374
16 years ago,
I was sexually assaulted.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.466
You know what?

16:29.510 --> 16:32.774
Forget "sexually assaulted."
I was raped.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.648
That's the first time
I've ever called it

16:37.692 --> 16:39.607
what it really was.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.958
Mugging victims aren't ashamed
they were robbed.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.700
Why should I be ashamed
I was raped?

16:45.743 --> 16:47.267
[sighs]

16:47.310 --> 16:50.226
What I am ashamed of
is that I kept it a secret.

16:50.270 --> 16:53.186
This...

16:53.229 --> 16:56.972
"guy" counted on me

16:57.016 --> 17:00.019
being too embarrassed

17:00.062 --> 17:02.499
and afraid to
come forward,

17:02.543 --> 17:05.111
and you know what?

17:05.154 --> 17:06.721
He was right.

17:10.116 --> 17:13.031
And so, tonight,
I would like to make amends

17:13.075 --> 17:16.731
to any woman
that might have been hurt

17:16.773 --> 17:19.951
because I was too scared
to say anything.

17:22.388 --> 17:26.175
If my silence
encouraged him to believe

17:26.219 --> 17:30.919
that he could attack
or intimidate or even grab

17:30.962 --> 17:33.052
another woman
without consequences,

17:33.095 --> 17:34.923
I am so, so sorry.

17:34.966 --> 17:38.013
Maybe I can't change the past,

17:38.057 --> 17:42.104
but from now on, I am...

17:42.148 --> 17:45.586
going to speak
out, shout out,

17:45.629 --> 17:48.110
and shine a light down

17:48.154 --> 17:50.460
that can be seen
from frickin' outer space,

17:50.504 --> 17:52.288
if it'll keep
something like this

17:52.332 --> 17:54.116
from happening to anyone else.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.639
[door closes]

17:55.683 --> 17:57.032
Thank you.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.343
BRUCE: Does anyone
else want to share?

18:10.219 --> 18:11.699
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing

18:11.742 --> 18:13.744
I tell my mom:
I wouldn't mind living with you

18:13.788 --> 18:15.746
if you made a little less noise.

18:15.790 --> 18:19.576
Yeah, like you're a drive
through wine country.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.012
Okay, Jiminy.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.624
Time to go
on our separate journeys.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.414
Jump, my little friend.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.373
Be free.

18:35.157 --> 18:38.552
Jump.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.510
Why isn't he jumping?

18:40.554 --> 18:43.034
Maybe he got attached to me
and doesn't want to leave.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.776
Huh. Or maybe you didn't
put any holes in the jar

18:45.820 --> 18:48.649
and he's dead.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.085
[scoffs]

18:50.129 --> 18:53.436
You really are a source
of comfort and support.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.699
And a cat
just ate him.
