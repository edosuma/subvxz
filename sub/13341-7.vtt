01:01.959 --> 01:05.166
( piano music playing )

02:03.333 --> 02:05.834
( bus brakes hiss )

02:07.458 --> 02:09.500
- Hey.
- Marnie: Hi.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.291
What's up?

02:10.291 --> 02:12.041
- Hi.
- Hi, how's it goin'?

02:12.041 --> 02:13.959
It's good.
How was the ride?

02:13.959 --> 02:15.417
I have to fucking
piss so badly,

02:15.417 --> 02:16.750
- I'm gonna shit myself.
- Oh, God.

02:16.750 --> 02:20.041
I can't believe
we're in the Hamptons.

02:20.041 --> 02:21.417
Oh, no, this is
the North Fork.

02:21.417 --> 02:22.792
It's very different
from the Hamptons.

02:22.792 --> 02:24.750
It's, you know,
for people who think
the Hamptons are tacky

02:24.750 --> 02:27.250
and don't want to be
on a beach that's near
a J.Crew.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.208
J.Crew?

02:28.208 --> 02:30.875
Where's Jessa?
Did she not even show?

02:30.875 --> 02:32.917
No, she just insisted
on sitting in the back
of the bus

02:32.917 --> 02:34.125
for political reasons.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.708
I will text you
the minute I recharge
my phone.

02:36.708 --> 02:40.125
So good to meet you.
You guys are the best.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.959
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.542
Uh, I hope you don't mind.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.750
I invited Rita and Luther
to hang with us this weekend.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.625
They're amazing.
Luther's an orthodontist.

02:48.625 --> 02:51.500
Yeah, the only thing is that
my mom's friend Suzanne

02:51.500 --> 02:53.667
was so generous letting us
stay in this house this weekend

02:53.667 --> 02:56.792
that it feels a little bit
like it might be rude to have
bus people in it.

02:56.792 --> 02:59.417
Okay, don't worry.
I mean, they probably
won't come.

02:59.417 --> 03:01.250
It was just, like,
a token invite.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.792
Not worried.

03:07.291 --> 03:09.625
Oh, my God.

03:09.625 --> 03:11.625
I call biggest
and/or best room.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.333
No one can call anything
without saying "shotgun," okay?

03:14.333 --> 03:15.959
Shotgun!

03:16.875 --> 03:18.000
No!

03:18.000 --> 03:19.750
Shosh, no, no,
no, no, no.

03:19.750 --> 03:21.750
I threw my bag on first.
Do you know what that means?

03:21.750 --> 03:23.291
- It means nothing!
- Jessa: Get off!

03:23.291 --> 03:24.917
First one who gets in
gets the bed.

03:24.917 --> 03:25.959
Ow, your shoes
are hurting me.

03:25.959 --> 03:27.417
Hey, guys, you know what?
Don't worry about it.

03:27.417 --> 03:28.917
I think I'm just
gonna take this room.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.959
You guys, I had a feeling
this was gonna happen,

03:30.959 --> 03:33.583
so I went ahead
and assigned the rooms.

03:34.333 --> 03:35.750
So, Shosh is in here.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.291
Hannah, you and I
are downstairs,

03:37.291 --> 03:38.792
- and, Jessa, I put you
in the lighthouse...
- Great.

03:38.792 --> 03:39.750
'cause it's bohemian.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.291
- Wait, there's a lighthouse?
- No.

03:41.291 --> 03:43.125
Wait, there's a lighthouse?
Excuse me.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.625
- It's all right.
- You can have this room!

03:44.625 --> 03:46.166
You can have
this room.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.166
So, we're sharing a room?

03:47.166 --> 03:48.708
Well, it's two
different rooms,

03:48.708 --> 03:50.583
but they connect,
so, options.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.542
Cool.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.625
I'm so excited.
It's like old times.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.834
Me, too.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.959
♪ One, two,
three, four... ♪

03:58.959 --> 04:01.333
( music playing )

04:04.917 --> 04:08.208
This is so fun!
It's so nice!

04:15.708 --> 04:17.250
( screams )

04:19.375 --> 04:20.666
What? Oh!

04:20.666 --> 04:23.667
- ( music muffled )
- Jessa: Oh, thank God.

04:25.667 --> 04:26.917
No!

04:26.917 --> 04:28.166
Not funny.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.625
- ( laughs )
- That's not funny.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.375
Hannah: Ow!

04:32.375 --> 04:36.500
Ow!
This is so hard
on my feet, you guys.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.166
You were on the phone
for so long,

04:38.166 --> 04:40.625
you didn't hear what I said
about swim shoes.

04:40.625 --> 04:41.917
This is c-- ow!

04:41.917 --> 04:44.125
Oh, my God.
I'm not staying down here.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.041
It's like a monsoon
is brewing.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.583
It's the best swimming
conditions imaginable.

04:48.583 --> 04:51.750
I'm having the time
of my life, seriously.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.875
I can't go in open water
unless I'm menstruating.

04:55.875 --> 04:58.125
You guys, we're
so disconnected now.

04:58.125 --> 05:01.166
I thought this would
just be a nice opportunity
for us to have fun together

05:01.166 --> 05:03.834
and, you know,
prove to everyone
via Instagram

05:03.834 --> 05:05.834
that we can still
have fun as a group.

05:05.834 --> 05:07.291
But we do still
have fun as a group.

05:07.291 --> 05:10.125
We don't need
to have some, like,
perfect weekend, you know?

05:10.125 --> 05:11.959
I don't know.
I kind of like this idea.

05:11.959 --> 05:14.917
- Thank you.
- I've learned a lot of great
communication games in rehab

05:14.917 --> 05:17.375
- and we could play those.
- Marnie: Yeah, they're so fun.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.208
But I just think we have
a lot of healing to do,

05:19.208 --> 05:21.166
and we have a lot of ways
that we could do it.

05:21.166 --> 05:22.542
That's all I'm saying.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.708
Should we start the healing now
in this horrifying wind tunnel?

05:24.708 --> 05:26.166
No, you know,
I was actually thinking

05:26.166 --> 05:28.125
the healing would
take place at dinner,

05:28.125 --> 05:30.208
but after that,
we would do face masks

05:30.208 --> 05:31.708
and watch
"The Queens of Comedy,"

05:31.708 --> 05:34.583
and then we could maybe
write our wishes down
on pieces of paper

05:34.583 --> 05:37.500
and then throw them
into a bonfire so they
come true.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.708
But for now we have
to go grocery shopping.

05:43.667 --> 05:44.917
Don't you think
you should probably

05:44.917 --> 05:47.625
be wearing clothes and shoes
if you're going into town?

05:47.625 --> 05:50.250
No, this is a beach town.
That's not how they operate.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.291
Okay.

05:55.083 --> 05:57.125
"No bare feet."
Fucking bullshit.

05:57.125 --> 06:00.250
- Can I have
your list, then?
- Here you go.

06:00.250 --> 06:03.291
- Where was that?
- In my back pocket.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.625
- You wanna wear
one of my shoes?
- No, thank you.

06:06.625 --> 06:08.333
- You sure?
- Yeah, I like it
better out here.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.083
Can you please get me
some white cheddar Goldfish?

06:10.083 --> 06:12.750
I don't think
Marnie will let me.
It's not on the list.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.750
- ( blows raspberry ) Okay.
- Sorry.

06:17.125 --> 06:20.458
( men chattering )

06:20.458 --> 06:23.208
Elijah:
Oh, my God, look, you guys.
"Spring Breakers."

06:23.208 --> 06:25.417
- Oh, my God.
- That makes me sick.

06:25.417 --> 06:26.750
Hannah.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.125
Are you fucking
kidding me?

06:30.125 --> 06:32.417
Hi-lo. Hi.

06:32.417 --> 06:34.250
What are you
doing here?

06:34.250 --> 06:38.125
Um, uh, we all
were just saying how much
we love your bikini.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.834
Yeah, so few people
are going bold to
the beach anymore.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.458
- Absolutely.
- That's not true.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.291
I heard you
laughing at it.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.959
You did say it
pretty loud.

06:45.959 --> 06:47.375
Oh, my God.

06:47.375 --> 06:48.667
We'll be
in the wicker shop.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.000
Okay, just give me
a second, boo.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah, but with you,
one second's always
about 20 minutes, boo.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.041
( chuckles nervously )

06:56.041 --> 06:58.166
Nobody was
making fun of you.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.750
I heard you.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.375
It's a good thing I'm not
as susceptible to criticism
as I used to be.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.667
What are you doing here?

07:04.667 --> 07:07.208
Getting away from
the daily grind
of city life

07:07.208 --> 07:09.667
and my high-powered job
in the magazine industry

07:09.667 --> 07:12.000
and making memories
with my friends that
will last a lifetime.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
The usual.
I don't know, Elijah.
What are you doing here?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.667
Um, you know,
we're just staying
at a friend's house

07:16.667 --> 07:19.333
that I think we thought
was a little more
centrally located,

07:19.333 --> 07:20.667
you know,
like in the Hamptons,

07:20.667 --> 07:22.208
so it's kinda weird
that we're not in the Hamptons.

07:22.208 --> 07:25.750
I don't want
to make small talk
with you, all right?

07:26.834 --> 07:28.166
Hannah, I'm sorry.

07:28.166 --> 07:29.542
About the "Spring
Breakers" comment?

07:29.542 --> 07:31.041
'Cause that didn't offend me.
I think that movie

07:31.041 --> 07:32.583
was a beautiful blend
of art and commerce.

07:32.583 --> 07:36.250
No, I mean-- I mean,
I'm sorry for everything.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.375
For everything that happened
the last time I saw you.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.875
I feel terrible
about all of it.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.458
I think about you
all the time,

07:42.458 --> 07:45.542
and what are you doing?
And what's wrong with her?

07:45.542 --> 07:48.208
And what's she eating?
And who she's mad at.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.250
I just think about you
all the time

07:50.250 --> 07:51.917
and I miss you so much.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.208
Gosh, I miss you, too.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.667
- I really  miss you.
- You do?

07:57.667 --> 08:00.125
Every time I see
something that sucks,
like, royally but subtly,

08:00.125 --> 08:02.542
I think to myself,
"Only Elijah would
understand this."

08:02.542 --> 08:04.917
And then I don't even
remember why I'm mad.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.166
Well, 'cause I had sex
with Marnie.

08:06.166 --> 08:07.708
- Yeah, no, I know.
- Okay, okay.

08:07.708 --> 08:10.792
And Marnie is acting
like such a psychopathic
nightmare.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.041
Ugh, I can only imagine.

08:12.041 --> 08:14.166
She's just,
like, walking around,
bossing everybody around

08:14.166 --> 08:16.959
like a mean,
skinny Miss Hannigan.

08:16.959 --> 08:19.000
- Yeah.
- ( sighs )

08:19.000 --> 08:22.250
Why don't you come over?
Why don't you guys come over?

08:22.250 --> 08:23.708
It'll fucking save the day.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.250
Let's just forget
everything and come over

08:25.250 --> 08:27.083
and save me
from this hell.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.458
( laughs )
Yes.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.917
- I love you.
- I love you.

08:30.917 --> 08:33.082
- ( music playing )
- What are you making?

08:33.082 --> 08:35.000
It's called
the North Fork Fizz.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.582
Oh, that sounds
so yummy.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.582
I'm inventing it
as we speak.

08:38.582 --> 08:41.375
So, I gained 25 pounds,
but then I lost 30 pounds.

08:41.375 --> 08:42.707
Oh, amazing.
How did you do it?

08:42.707 --> 08:44.333
The Victoria Principal
diet.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.875
Wow, what does
that consist of?

08:45.875 --> 08:48.750
It's black coffee
and you can have one slice
of turkey until 4:00 PM,

08:48.750 --> 08:50.250
and then you can do
whatever you want.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.250
- Hannah, sorry to interrupt.
- I could actually do that.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.041
Could you come do
a tick check on me
in the other room?

08:55.041 --> 08:57.291
- A tick check?
- Mm-hmm.

08:57.291 --> 08:59.583
I was just rummaging outside
and I feel like I might have
gotten a tick,

08:59.583 --> 09:02.834
so I just need to talk to you
in the other room maybe
so you can check.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.375
- Okay.
- Oh.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.208
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.166
- What?
- I cannot believe
you invited them.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.959
What am I supposed
to do, Marnie?

09:11.959 --> 09:13.458
They kind of
invited themselves.

09:13.458 --> 09:16.291
And, anyway, we cannot
put this much pressure
on our relationships.

09:16.291 --> 09:17.959
This will really
lighten the mood.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.792
The mood is already
plenty light.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.875
I just really think
this is gonna be important

09:21.875 --> 09:23.458
and this is
gonna be healing.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.708
Elijah was the beginning
of this whole rift.

09:25.708 --> 09:27.417
I know, and that's why
it's so weird he's here.

09:27.417 --> 09:29.792
Plus, they're a lot of fun.
They're theater people.

09:29.792 --> 09:32.125
That's your
favorite breed, okay?

09:32.125 --> 09:35.458
Listen,
Gerald's a choreographer,
Paul's an understudy,

09:35.458 --> 09:37.125
Pal is a theater publicist.

09:37.125 --> 09:41.166
He did "Kinky Boots,"
the whole viral marketing
campaign.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.792
I can't believe
that's who came after me.

09:43.792 --> 09:47.291
Well, knowing Elijah, it was
11 closeted math teachers
who came after you,

09:47.291 --> 09:50.750
but after that, it was Pal,
and he seems great.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.333
Okay.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.000
( music continues )

09:55.000 --> 09:57.583
( laughing )

09:57.583 --> 09:59.834
All right, who wants
another North Fork Fizz?

09:59.834 --> 10:02.625
- I fucking do!
- Gerald: Those things
always make me sick.

10:02.625 --> 10:04.166
- Thank you.
- Fill it up, please.

10:04.166 --> 10:07.041
- I think they are so sweet.
- And thank you.

10:07.041 --> 10:10.708
( chatter continues )

10:10.708 --> 10:11.917
What are you making?

10:11.917 --> 10:14.083
Um, it's a julienne
vegetable salad

10:14.083 --> 10:15.667
from "The Art
of French Cooking."

10:15.667 --> 10:17.208
It's for four, so...

10:18.375 --> 10:21.458
Uh, the vegetables
are very thinly chopped.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.208
Yeah, that's what it means
to julienne something.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.208
Look, Marnie,
I'm really sorry

10:28.208 --> 10:30.250
things turned out
the way they did.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.333
- Yeah, me, too.
- No.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.083
Really, I mean it.

10:34.083 --> 10:35.750
I regret it.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.000
I do, too.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.667
And I really hope
we can be friends.

10:40.667 --> 10:41.834
I really do.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.708
I just have
a new take on things.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.542
I guess I'm in love,

10:45.542 --> 10:48.291
and I just--
it changed me,
in a way.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.291
I know it's stupid
and you're gonna
make fun of me,

10:50.291 --> 10:52.000
but he's been taking me
to kabbalah classes

10:52.000 --> 10:55.208
and I just-- I'm trying
not to be so negative.

10:55.208 --> 10:58.625
Yeah, that's, um--
that's beautiful.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.875
That's amazing.

10:59.875 --> 11:02.125
So you're, like,
in love with him.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.041
Yes, I am.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.125
- I mean, I haven't
told him yet, but--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.625
But I will soon.
I can't keep it in
for too long.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.959
- No, you can't.
- Shoshanna: Oh, my God.
I love this song!

11:11.959 --> 11:14.417
( chanting )
Shot, shot, shot,
shot, shot, shot!

11:14.417 --> 11:18.792
( cheering, laughing )

11:18.792 --> 11:20.917
She's in such
a great place right now.

11:20.917 --> 11:23.083
That's disgusting.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.291
I'm so happy
about you and Elijah.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.959
Honestly, it's been
a rough road for him

11:26.959 --> 11:28.708
and he needed
somebody like you.

11:28.708 --> 11:32.041
Yeah, no, he's great.
He's really great.

11:32.041 --> 11:35.250
I don't know
what the fuck he does
with his days, but...

11:35.250 --> 11:37.542
supposedly he's running
a semi-improvised
dance troupe

11:37.542 --> 11:39.250
and working at the glove
department at Barney's,

11:39.250 --> 11:42.375
but whenever I call him,
he's sleeping.

11:42.375 --> 11:45.166
And by sleeping,
I mean jerking off.

11:45.166 --> 11:49.000
Well, my boyfriend, too,
jerks off quite a bit,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.542
and I just thank him
for taking his energy--

11:52.542 --> 11:54.208
at least half of it--
elsewhere.

11:54.208 --> 11:58.041
Otherwise, I'd be
a pounded-out piece of meat.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.500
( laughs )
Oh, my God.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.792
Do you know
who you remind me of?

12:01.792 --> 12:04.208
This has been on my mind
all day and I just
figured it out.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.333
- Who?
- My friend Sadie.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.792
- Really?
- Yeah, she's always
trying new things.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.375
She is such a dilettante.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.250
Oh, my God.
So funny, thank you.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.208
She showers,
like, once a month.

12:14.208 --> 12:15.250
She's so crazy.

12:15.250 --> 12:16.708
I love her.
I love Sadie.

12:16.708 --> 12:20.500
Hey, doesn't
Hannah remind you
of crazy-ass Sadie?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.792
Sadie is fat as shit.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.500
Let's go on
a house tour.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.000
You are way skinnier
than Sadie.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.875
- Like, way skinnier.
- Thanks.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.792
So, finally he called me
at around noon,

12:33.792 --> 12:38.792
and he was like,
"Hey, I think we need
to talk about some things.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.458
I love you and I want
to propose to you--"

12:41.458 --> 12:42.667
What?

12:42.667 --> 12:44.583
"But I think we need to talk
about a couple things first."

12:44.583 --> 12:47.625
So I grill the pizzas
and I wait, and I wait
and wait.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.250
Finally,
at around 10:00 PM,

12:49.250 --> 12:51.959
he walks
through the front door
with a friend from work

12:51.959 --> 12:55.208
and starts packing up
his things.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.041
While you
were eating pizza?

12:57.041 --> 12:58.875
He does not say
a word to me.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.500
Me, in our apartment.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.333
I'm standing there,
he doesn't say anything
to me.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.083
And then finally
he gets to the door

13:04.083 --> 13:05.708
and he's about to walk out,
and he turns around.

13:05.708 --> 13:08.083
He looks me
right in the eyes
and he says,

13:08.083 --> 13:12.625
"I don't love you
and I've never loved you."

13:15.041 --> 13:19.333
Marnie, I'm so sorry.
That's-- that's, like,
the worst story ever.

13:19.333 --> 13:23.583
- Truly.
- Anyway, his business
went under or some shit.

13:23.583 --> 13:25.667
And I hear he's, like,
a carpenter's apprentice.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.458
He's working in,
like, a sneaker store.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.291
Ugh, good.
I've always hated him.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.708
What? I thought you guys
were really close in college.

13:32.708 --> 13:35.583
No, that's when I thought
we were both closet cases.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.041
We watched
"Wild Things" once,

13:37.041 --> 13:39.417
and I was pretty sure
we were gonna start
jacking off together,

13:39.417 --> 13:41.708
but then he started
dating you

13:41.708 --> 13:44.667
and I realized that his issues
were way more complicated

13:44.667 --> 13:46.000
than just being gay.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.375
- Hey, boo.
- Hi.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.667
Oh, my gosh.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.542
- Oh, Jesus.
- ( gasps ) Oh, my gosh.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.375
Gerald always
does this dance
when he drinks.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.041
It was the first dance
he ever did on Broadway,

13:56.041 --> 13:57.708
so it's extremely
emotional for him.

13:57.708 --> 13:59.250
It's amazing.

13:59.250 --> 14:00.375
- Is it?
- Yes.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.166
I thought so, too,
the first time I saw it.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.542
But now I'm like,
"How many times do we
need to see this dance?"

14:05.542 --> 14:08.083
You are such a bitch.
It's amazing.

14:08.083 --> 14:09.542
Ray is encouraging me
to explore

14:09.542 --> 14:11.083
the more artistic sides
of my personality.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.083
I think he's right.
We should all be more creative.

14:13.083 --> 14:16.583
- Who's Ray?
- Ray Ploshansky.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.250
- Old Man Ray?
- Yeah.

14:19.250 --> 14:22.125
Since when
are you hanging out
with Old Man Ray?

14:23.834 --> 14:26.875
I'm gonna go have Gerald
teach me that dance.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.417
Yes.
Gerald.

14:29.417 --> 14:32.125
- She's fucking him.
- I fucked her once.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.583
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.333
Come on, Hannah.
It's time for the rehearsal.

14:37.333 --> 14:40.458
- Pal: The rehearsal?
- Whatever. It's, like,
a fun thing to do.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.792
You know what else would be
a fun thing to do is eat.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.333
Who else is fucking starving?

14:44.333 --> 14:45.750
You should just drink more.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.708
I already feel pretty loose.
Dangerously loose.

14:48.708 --> 14:51.250
Hannah, do you
want me to stay sober?

14:51.250 --> 14:52.458
Yes.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.792
Because you know
it's either me or you

14:53.792 --> 14:54.959
who's gonna
drink that drink.

14:54.959 --> 14:56.959
Do you want that
on your shoulders?

14:56.959 --> 14:58.917
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?

14:58.917 --> 15:01.333
- Are you serious?
- Do you want that on you?
Do you want that on you?

15:01.333 --> 15:03.500
- No.
- Oh, my God.
Relapse city.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.000
- No.
- Here it comes.
Here it comes.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.834
- Call my sponsor.
Oh, shit.
- No!

15:06.834 --> 15:09.333
- ( laughter )
- Please give this to me.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.708
You're such a bitch.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.000
Jessa:
You're a good friend.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.959
So, let's do that one more time.
Okay, so, head to the right.

15:14.959 --> 15:17.750
- Ooh, yeah.
- So, right shoulder,
left shoulder, head front.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.834
- ( gasps ) Surprise.
- ( all gasp )

15:20.834 --> 15:22.708
Okay, no, no, uh-uh.
You can't make that face.

15:22.708 --> 15:24.083
Close your-- close.

15:24.083 --> 15:28.000
Five, six, seven, eight.
"You're breaking my heart,

15:28.000 --> 15:31.417
you're tearing it apart,
so fuck you."

15:31.417 --> 15:32.625
Left, right.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.750
- Spank the ass.
- Slap it, slap it,
slap it, go.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.875
- Yes!
- Yes. Very good.

15:36.875 --> 15:39.458
- Very nice, you all.
- Marnie!

15:39.458 --> 15:41.792
I just think I have
abandonment issues,

15:41.792 --> 15:43.166
if I'm being
totally honest.

15:43.166 --> 15:44.708
And it's much more
than I realize.

15:44.708 --> 15:45.834
And they're all
from my father,

15:45.834 --> 15:48.875
but they just
rear their heads
in other ways.

15:48.875 --> 15:50.834
Marnie,
of course you do.

15:50.834 --> 15:53.959
How could you not
with that asshole
in your life?

15:53.959 --> 15:55.208
You know what I mean?

15:55.208 --> 15:57.542
And then, for me,
I have the opposite thing

15:57.542 --> 15:59.458
which is that
it has been so hard for me

15:59.458 --> 16:01.458
to get the space that I need
from my parents.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.417
Loreen and Tad
are so involved.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.208
They never gave me
any space to even read a book,

16:05.208 --> 16:06.500
just calling,
"Hannah, Hannah, Hannah."

16:06.500 --> 16:09.083
- Oh, my God.
- And, so, when
I was finally an adult,

16:09.083 --> 16:11.333
I went to seize
that space,

16:11.333 --> 16:13.834
and I think you ended up
being a casualty of that.

16:13.834 --> 16:16.375
And I feel
so sorry for that.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.667
Do not have
any guilt about this
because I am okay.

16:18.667 --> 16:22.875
I may not seem okay,
and I might not be okay now,
but I am, like, okay.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.875
I was dreading this trip.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.208
I would've done
anything not to be here,

16:27.208 --> 16:29.250
but now I'm starting
to think it's gonna be

16:29.250 --> 16:31.333
one of the most meaningful
weekends of the summer.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.000
That is so nice,
seriously.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.417
- I love you.
I love you.
- I love you, too.

16:35.417 --> 16:36.708
( kisses )

16:36.708 --> 16:39.000
- ( laughs )
- Pick one.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.291
Pick one.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.458
We have not
assumed this position
in quite some time.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.375
I suppose so.
I guess that's right.

16:45.375 --> 16:49.166
Hey, Elijah.
Tell Paul what you
thought "inertia" meant.

16:49.166 --> 16:52.500
He thought "inertia" meant
when you're moving too fast.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.208
( both laugh )

16:54.208 --> 16:55.583
( whispers )
I still think that.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.208
- Thank you.
- That's a perfectly
reasonable thing to think.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.583
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:00.583 --> 17:03.125
Pal:
Oh, my God,
you're so naughty.

17:04.165 --> 17:06.750
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

17:06.750 --> 17:10.500
- It's just me.
- Yes, it is.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.333
Do you know that
you look like someone

17:13.333 --> 17:15.916
Mapplethorpe
would've photographed?

17:15.916 --> 17:17.458
I have no idea
who that is.

17:17.458 --> 17:19.875
Pal:
He has the haircut.
That was your clue.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.791
I don't like the way
that Pal talks to you.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.290
What do you mean?

17:23.290 --> 17:25.208
I just don't like it.
It's condescending.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.333
It's not respectful.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.959
Well, it doesn't
feel great.

17:29.959 --> 17:32.125
But I don't want to
break up with him either.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.458
I'm not saying
break up with him.

17:33.458 --> 17:34.625
I'm saying talk
to him about it.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.125
I don't want you
to think he's a bad person

17:36.125 --> 17:37.542
'cause he's not
a bad person.

17:37.542 --> 17:38.667
I don't think
he's a bad person.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.041
No, but I feel like
you're just seeing him

17:40.041 --> 17:42.542
at a time where
he's not at his best.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.417
- Marnie: Hey, Hannah?
- Yeah?

17:44.417 --> 17:45.625
Hi.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.625
Could you come here
really quickly?

17:47.625 --> 17:48.875
Come in here.

17:48.875 --> 17:52.792
Could you please
just, like, come here
really quickly?

17:52.792 --> 17:54.834
Okay.

18:01.125 --> 18:03.792
- Hi.
- Hi. What's going on?

18:03.792 --> 18:05.000
It's dinnertime.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.667
Okay, so get everyone
out of the pool.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.000
No, no, no,
it's dinnertime for us.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.083
Shoshanna:
Stop touching my real boobs!

18:10.083 --> 18:12.166
- So, you mean...
- Yeah.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.750
Marnie, I'm not gonna
kick everybody out.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.125
They're having
a really good time.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.667
That would be
really weird and rude.

18:16.667 --> 18:19.000
I know, but I kinda thought
they were only gonna stay
until dinner.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.291
Why would you think that?

18:20.291 --> 18:23.458
Because it's the time
where the four of us
are going to heal.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.000
But we already
did our healing.
Earlier, remember?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.208
We're both so sorry.
I am so sorry.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.542
Yes, you and I did,
but the four of us didn't.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.667
Are you fucking serious?

18:32.667 --> 18:34.834
- Yes, I'm fucking ser--
- Guys, dinner!

18:34.834 --> 18:37.083
( all cheer )

18:37.083 --> 18:39.000
Shoshanna:
Dinner's done.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.375
Cool. Really cool.
That's classy.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.250
- Thank you, Marnie.
- Welcome.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.917
Hey, thank you.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.125
( both laugh )

18:47.125 --> 18:48.917
- Thank you.
- Hi.

18:48.917 --> 18:50.041
Hi.

18:50.041 --> 18:53.125
- What's for dinner?
- What took so long, Marnie?

18:54.458 --> 18:58.208
Wait, wait, wait.
What's this, a fucking
kid's meal?

18:58.208 --> 19:01.542
- ( all laughing )
- A fucking Lean Cuisine?

19:01.542 --> 19:04.208
Am I on the Zone Diet?

19:04.208 --> 19:05.542
Marnie, fuck.

19:05.542 --> 19:07.542
I got four duck breasts
for four people.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.875
There are so many people.
Hard times, Marn?

19:09.875 --> 19:11.708
( laughter )

19:11.708 --> 19:15.333
Wait, Pal, Pal.
She cooked the duck,
so do your Daffy Duck.

19:15.333 --> 19:18.667
( strained voice )
No, Marnie, please
don't cook me.

19:18.667 --> 19:21.333
Oh, my God, I don't wanna die.
I'm too young to die.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.875
Oh, wait.
Oh, this feels good.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.875
- ( screams )
- Jessa: Oh, my God!

19:24.875 --> 19:26.208
Isn't it so good?

19:26.208 --> 19:29.208
- That's Donald Duck.
- But you knew who
he was doing.

19:29.208 --> 19:30.750
Nope, you said
Daffy Duck.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.125
- Whatever, it's a duck.
- Elijah: It's a duck.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.834
Like what
we're eating, sort of.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.458
I think the duck
turned out fuckin' awesome.

19:36.458 --> 19:37.959
- It's so good, Marnie.
- It's really good, yeah.

19:37.959 --> 19:41.417
- I love it.
- No, no, no.
No, no, no, don't.

19:41.417 --> 19:43.000
I don't
really like duck.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.667
( laughing )

19:45.667 --> 19:47.500
Nobody likes duck.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.208
Are you ready?

19:49.208 --> 19:50.667
Come on, Marnie.
It's a four-person dance.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.250
- We need you.
- I'm not in the mood.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.583
- Come on, you're the best one.
- Ladies, can we do this?

19:54.583 --> 19:55.417
- Yes.
- Marnie: Fine.

19:55.417 --> 19:56.750
Are you ready
with the iPod?

19:56.750 --> 19:59.083
- Yes, can we please start?
- Gerald: Press play, please.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.166
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.542
No time for text from Mom.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.208

20:55.291 --> 20:57.083
Marnie:
That was so good.

20:57.083 --> 21:00.250
- Hannah: That was so good.
- Oh, my gosh. That was awesome.

21:00.250 --> 21:01.667
I think if we could
do it one more time,

21:01.667 --> 21:03.208
we'll get it, like,
really, really perfect.

21:03.208 --> 21:04.500
I think it'll be
awesome.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.208
But we're not, like,
trying to make it
to Broadway.

21:06.208 --> 21:07.667
Marnie:
No, no, no, I know.
( laughs )

21:07.667 --> 21:09.333
I know, no.
It's just that, um...

21:09.333 --> 21:11.166
there was this one moment
where you were on the four

21:11.166 --> 21:14.041
when you were supposed
to be on the three, so there
was this big hole in there.

21:14.041 --> 21:15.000
Yeah, yeah, totally.
I agree.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.500
The three-count
was really dead.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.458
Yeah, I would say overall,
though, your performance
was pretty good.

21:19.458 --> 21:20.875
Yeah, but why does
everything have to be perfect?

21:20.875 --> 21:23.125
- Like, it had
a lot of spirit.
- No, I know.

21:23.125 --> 21:24.583
It's just that if things
can't be perfect,

21:24.583 --> 21:27.166
maybe they could be
as close to perfect
as possible.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.583
Like when you have
a dinner for four,

21:28.583 --> 21:31.166
maybe you could have
just, like, a really
perfect dinner party

21:31.166 --> 21:34.875
for four people
to really enjoy properly.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.917
You're seriously mad
I let everyone stay
for dinner?

21:37.917 --> 21:39.250
Oh, my God.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.542
- Paul: Wait, time-out.
That was dinner?
- ( groans )

21:41.542 --> 21:44.291
Okay, you know what?
Let's just Google Map
a Domino's.

21:44.291 --> 21:47.375
- That's fun.
- We're in the North Fork, boo.
They don't have Domino's.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.417
Dinner was supposed to be
our time for honesty.

21:49.417 --> 21:51.333
And I'm really sorry, you guys.
This is not about you.

21:51.333 --> 21:55.041
This is between us,
but then you invited
the cast of "Magic Mike."

21:55.041 --> 21:57.875
Marnie, I don't feel
like being honest.

21:57.875 --> 22:00.291
Why not?
Being honest is fun.

22:00.291 --> 22:02.875
What are you
talking about, Shosh?

22:02.875 --> 22:05.166
I'm talking about
the fact that you're
a fucking narcissist.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.959
Seriously, I have
never met anyone else

22:06.959 --> 22:09.166
who thinks their own life
is so fucking fascinating.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.625
I wanted to fall asleep
in my own vomit all day

22:11.625 --> 22:15.750
listening to you talk
about how you bruise more
easily than other people.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.917
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

22:17.917 --> 22:20.083
Hannah: Okay,
well, people have been
calling me a narcissist

22:20.083 --> 22:21.834
since I was three,
so it doesn't really upset me.

22:21.834 --> 22:23.583
You've gotta choose
something more creative.

22:23.583 --> 22:25.208
Yeah, it really
has no effect on you.

22:25.208 --> 22:26.500
Now you.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.583
So we're untabling
our issues, then?

22:28.583 --> 22:29.750
I wanted to do this
at dinner.

22:29.750 --> 22:32.834
Oh, my God.
Can you chill
the fuck out about dinner?

22:32.834 --> 22:34.959
Seriously, that duck
tasted like a used condom

22:34.959 --> 22:36.959
and I want
to forget about it.

22:36.959 --> 22:39.291
Shosh has gone
totally insane.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.083
I don't know.
Maybe she's gone sane.

22:41.083 --> 22:42.708
You guys never
listen to me.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.500
You treat me like
I'm a fucking cab driver.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.083
Seriously, you have entire
conversations in front of me
like I am invisible.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.125
And sometimes I wonder
if my social anxiety

22:50.125 --> 22:52.208
is holding me back
from meeting the people

22:52.208 --> 22:53.834
who would actually
be right for me

22:53.834 --> 22:57.000
instead of a bunch of fucking
whiny nothings as friends.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.125
Well, maybe Shosh
has a point.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.458
I mean, it's not like
the four of us

23:00.458 --> 23:04.458
have had any real fun together
in the last, what, two years?

23:04.458 --> 23:05.708
That is not true.

23:05.708 --> 23:07.625
Name one fun thing.

23:07.625 --> 23:10.375
This trip, if we had done
anything I planned.

23:10.375 --> 23:11.792
Oh, my God!

23:11.792 --> 23:13.083
Hey, Marnie.

23:13.083 --> 23:15.000
You know, I think
you should process
what you just said

23:15.000 --> 23:18.750
because, you know,
happiness is about
appreciating what you have.

23:18.750 --> 23:21.959
- Yes.
- What is that, like,
some AA bullshit?

23:21.959 --> 23:24.667
Seriously,
Jessa goes to rehab
for five fucking seconds

23:24.667 --> 23:27.792
and we have to
listen to everything
she comes up with.

23:27.792 --> 23:30.667
- Shosh, you're
a cruel drunk.
- It's crazy.

23:30.667 --> 23:33.750
She's a cruel drunk
and she's also not
an intellectual.

23:33.750 --> 23:35.291
Jessa:
Actually, she is.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.417
I'm gonna stick up
for Shosh on this one

23:37.417 --> 23:40.625
and say that I have seen
her read the newspaper
on her phone.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.083
Then why,
when I'm around her,

23:42.083 --> 23:43.583
do I feel like my brain
is gonna atrophy?

23:43.583 --> 23:45.917
I would call you
a little unstimulating.

23:45.917 --> 23:47.208
"Unstimulating"?

23:47.208 --> 23:50.000
What, are we in, like,
a fucking Jane Austen novel?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.333
What, do I want
to be like you?

23:51.333 --> 23:53.792
Like, mentally ill
and miserable?

23:53.792 --> 23:56.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
when did we start with all
of this name-calling, guys?

23:56.917 --> 23:58.417
We didn't start
with the name-calling.

23:58.417 --> 24:00.083
Shosh started
with the name-calling.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.000
Um, I did not start
with the name-calling.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.291
I started with your
fucking honesty idea,
Miss Tan Legs.

24:05.291 --> 24:07.125
I've never talked
to you that way.

24:07.125 --> 24:10.458
You are tortured
by self-doubt and fear,

24:10.458 --> 24:12.708
and it is not pleasant
to be around.

24:12.708 --> 24:15.834
That is really
fucking mean.

24:15.834 --> 24:18.542
- That is mean.
- Marnie: It is really mean,

24:18.542 --> 24:20.375
what you just said,
Shoshanna.

24:20.375 --> 24:23.250
I'm sorry my heart
was fucking broken

24:23.250 --> 24:25.125
after Charlie dumped me.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.875
Well, we would have
no way of knowing that

24:26.875 --> 24:30.166
because the only issues
you ever talk about are
your issues with me.

24:30.166 --> 24:33.291
- Shoshanna: Mm-hmm.
- Seriously, we've known each
other for almost eight years.

24:33.291 --> 24:35.375
I've been
on this planet for 25,

24:35.375 --> 24:37.792
and I'm not showing
any signs of changing.

24:37.792 --> 24:40.625
Look, all you've ever done
is talk about the fact

24:40.625 --> 24:42.375
that you are changing,
that you want to change,

24:42.375 --> 24:43.875
self-improvement,
all that bullshit.

24:43.875 --> 24:46.125
So I get on board with it
and thus all you've done

24:46.125 --> 24:47.875
for the past couple
of years is disappoint me.

24:47.875 --> 24:51.291
Well, then maybe
you should lower
your expectations.

24:51.291 --> 24:54.208
I can't lower them
any further.

24:54.208 --> 24:56.875
Well, maybe you
should try what I do,

24:56.875 --> 25:01.208
which is I don't expect
anything from any of you.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.500
I'm so fucking sick
of all of you.

25:06.083 --> 25:08.708
I really miss
my boyfriend...

25:08.708 --> 25:13.458
who asks me for nothing,
so I give him everything.

25:14.417 --> 25:16.208
( sighs )

25:16.208 --> 25:20.959
So, um, I guess
what I would like

25:20.959 --> 25:24.458
is, um--
is just for you to be

25:24.458 --> 25:27.250
a little more
respectful of me.

25:27.250 --> 25:29.792
When have I ever
been disrespectful of you?

25:31.083 --> 25:34.417
Well, I-- it--
it was something that--

25:34.417 --> 25:35.917
it was something
that Hannah had noticed.

25:35.917 --> 25:37.375
- Hannah?
- And then it made me--

25:37.375 --> 25:40.583
I'm-- wait. I'm sorry,
something that Hannah said?

25:40.583 --> 25:42.792
Are you kidding me?

25:42.792 --> 25:44.500
That is the most
ridiculous girl

25:44.500 --> 25:46.458
I've ever met
in my entire life.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.583
You're taking advice
from Hannah?

25:48.583 --> 25:51.583
Oh, God.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.375
Yeah.

25:53.375 --> 25:55.458
Yeah, um...

25:56.583 --> 25:58.166
I just wanna
feel comfortable...

25:58.166 --> 26:00.959
- around you all the time...
- Mm-hmm.

26:03.291 --> 26:05.208
...because I love you.

26:06.750 --> 26:08.333
Oh.

26:09.583 --> 26:12.875
Wow, Elijah.

26:14.208 --> 26:18.291
Look, I'm starting to think
this isn't what you think it is.

26:18.291 --> 26:20.625
I mean, maybe
we shouldn't do this,

26:20.625 --> 26:24.500
because if you want something
that I can't give you--

26:24.500 --> 26:26.667
- No. No, no, no.
- Then I don't want
to lead you on.

26:26.667 --> 26:28.250
That's not--
that's not-- I think--

26:28.250 --> 26:29.792
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think that we--

26:29.792 --> 26:31.458
- that's not what I meant.
- Ok--

26:31.458 --> 26:33.000
That's not
what I meant.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.583
Okay, 'cause I--
I don't want you to feel--

26:35.583 --> 26:37.708
- No, it's totally fine.
- I don't want you to feel--

26:37.708 --> 26:40.166
- Let's just forget it.
Forget it.
- Okay.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.667
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

26:42.667 --> 26:45.333
- Are you gonna be
okay with this?
- I'm great.

26:45.333 --> 26:46.708
- Shh.
- Okay.

26:46.708 --> 26:48.583
- That's fine, then.
- ( belt buckle clinks )

26:48.583 --> 26:50.917
The truth is, I don't think
you're very talented.

26:50.917 --> 26:54.000
What? Hey,
are you kidding me?

26:54.000 --> 26:57.166
I spent $80,000
on a theater BFA.

26:57.166 --> 27:00.250
Of course
I am talented, Gerald.
