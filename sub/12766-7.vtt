ADDISON, SUSAN WAS WIDOWED
A FEW MONTHS INTO HER PREGNANCY.

03:13.041 --> 03:15.458
HER HUSBAND JASON WAS A COP.
HE WAS KILLED ON DUTY.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.625
OH, THAT'S--

03:17.667 --> 03:19.041
SHE'S HAD PANIC ATTACKS,

03:19.083 --> 03:21.542
AND THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM
DURING A BIRTH.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.750
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY OTHER FAMILY,

03:23.792 --> 03:25.750

UH, MS. McCULLOUGH,

09:47.083 --> 09:49.250
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

09:49.291 --> 09:51.041
UH... I...

09:51.083 --> 09:53.041
HE WAS JASON'S PARTNER.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.458
WELL, THAT'S NICE OF HIM
TO COME CHECK ON YOU,

09:55.500 --> 09:57.041

09:57.083 --> 09:59.667
IT IS, BUT... HE'S GONNA
GET EMOTIONAL,

A MEMORIAL FOR JASON.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.834

JASON WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED THAT.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.834
THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT
THE BABY.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.875
CAN YOU JUST
TELL HIM I'M FINE?

10:09.917 --> 10:12.333
HE CAN GO BACK TO WORK.

10:18.458 --> 10:19.875
UM... YEAH.

10:19.917 --> 10:23.041
I JUST...
FEEL A LITTLE ANXIOUS.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.500
HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

10:24.542 --> 10:27.917
I DIDN'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.041
GOD.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.083

WE'RE FOLLOWING THE PLAN.

10:37.500 --> 10:41.000
EVERYTHING'S
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

10:43.083 --> 10:44.792
OKAY.

10:44.834 --> 10:48.333
I'M FINE.
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.000
WHEN YOU HAVE SEX--

10:52.041 --> 10:54.041
I MEAN, WHEN THERE'S
NO ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENT,

10:54.083 --> 10:56.083
WHICH IS NEVER--
YES, THANK YOU.

10:56.125 --> 10:58.542
I JUST WANTED AN APPLE,
BUT NOW I GET TO TALK ABOUT

10:58.583 --> 11:01.041
THE FACT
THAT I'M AN EMOTIONAL DWARF?
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

11:01.083 --> 11:03.041
IS IT ABOUT THAT I SAID
THAT YOU NEEDED TO GET LAID,

11:03.083 --> 11:05.291
WHICH I DIDN'T SAY...
VERBALLY?

11:05.333 --> 11:08.291
NO, LISTEN, LISTEN, I'VE BEEN--
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.083
WHEN YOU DO IT,

11:10.125 --> 11:13.750
IT'S JUST NO-NONSENSE,
UNCOMPLICATED SEX, RIGHT?

11:13.792 --> 11:17.041
JUST SIMPLE,
STRESS-REDUCING FUN.

11:17.083 --> 11:18.500
THAT'S THE IDEA.

11:18.542 --> 11:21.500
WHAT, ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU?

11:21.542 --> 11:23.291
YEAH. WHY NOT?

11:23.333 --> 11:26.041
YOU AND ME--
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS, TONIGHT.

11:26.083 --> 11:29.333
I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:29.375 --> 11:31.041
I AM--I'M STRESSED OUT,
AND I JUST--

11:31.083 --> 11:33.333
I JUST NEED SOME...
(whispers) TOUCH.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.792
(normal voice)
AND YOU'RE PERFECT

11:34.834 --> 11:37.333
BECAUSE UNEMOTIONAL SEX
IS THE ONLY KIND YOU HAVE.

11:37.375 --> 11:38.792
AND--
SHH, SHH, SHH.

11:38.834 --> 11:41.041
WHAT TIME SHOULD I COME OVER?
REALLY?

11:41.083 --> 11:43.417
REALLY.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.250
OH, HEY, COOPER,
CAN YOU TAKE SAM'S 11:30?

11:51.291 --> 11:53.750
I GOTTA HELP WITH--
I'M GETTING LAID TONIGHT.

11:53.792 --> 11:55.750
CONGRATULATIONS.
WHAT'S HER SCREEN NAME?

11:55.792 --> 11:58.041
NO. ME AND VIOLET.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.208
WHAT?

12:00.250 --> 12:01.709
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS--
HER IDEA.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.834
NO STRINGS, NO EXPECTATIONS,
NO DOWNSIDE.

12:04.875 --> 12:07.166
YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S SMART?
GLASS HOUSE, STONE THROWER.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.166
YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME YOU
DATED A DOCTOR IN THIS PRACTICE?

12:09.208 --> 12:11.041
OH, THAT WAS FUN
FOR EVERYBODY.
OH, I DON'T--
THAT WAS ONE--

12:11.083 --> 12:13.000
AND NOW YOU AND ADDISON
HAVE THIS WHOLE WEIRD THING.

12:13.041 --> 12:15.917
I CAN MAKE IT WORK
WITH ADDISON.
BASED ON WHAT?

12:15.959 --> 12:18.375
"OH, ADDISON, YOU MOVED
DOWN HERE 'CAUSE I KISSED YOU."

12:18.417 --> 12:21.041
"OH, PETE, YOU FAKE DOCTOR.
YOUR TOUCH HEALS."

12:21.083 --> 12:23.041
YOU'VE BEEN FRIENDS
WITH VIOLET FOR YEARS.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.291
YOU REALLY THINK THINGS
ARE GONNA BE THE SAME

12:25.333 --> 12:28.417
AFTER YOU'VE SEEN HER NAKED?
NO, I THINK THINGS
ARE GONNA BE BETTER

12:28.458 --> 12:30.250
BECAUSE I WILL HAVE
SEEN HER NAKED.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.250
♪ I'M GETTING LAID ♪

12:32.291 --> 12:35.041

12:35.083 --> 12:36.458
ASHLEY, THIS IS DR. BENNETT.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.458
THINGS ARE A LITTLE BUSY
HERE TODAY,

12:38.500 --> 12:40.458

MONITORING YOUR CASE.
HI.

OH, NO, I GET QUEASY

12:49.375 --> 12:51.333
TRUST ME, HE'LL BE
MORE TROUBLE THAN GOOD.

12:51.375 --> 12:54.875
CAN YOU TAKE THE BOYS
TO THE LOBBY?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH 'EM?

12:54.917 --> 12:58.458
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.

UH, NAOMI, ADDISON, WE HAVE
A SITUATION. (clears throat)

13:07.333 --> 13:09.291

13:17.208 --> 13:19.166
I KNOW SUSAN DOESN'T WANT
ANYBODY IN THERE,

13:19.208 --> 13:21.166
BUT SHE'S PART OF OUR FAMILY,

13:21.208 --> 13:23.583
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE
ONE OF OUR OWN ALONE.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.125
GUYS COMING OFF SHIFT, UH,

THEY WANT TO BE HERE FOR HER.

NOW I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THIS WHOLE BIRTHING MYSELF,

13:29.834 --> 13:31.792
BUT KEITH HERE,
HE'S GOT TWO KIDS,

13:31.834 --> 13:35.083
ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY,
SO HE'S GOOD TO GO IN.

13:35.125 --> 13:38.291
I... I DON'T THINK SUSAN
IS GOING TO CHANGE HER MIND.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.625
BUT SUSAN--
SHE'S--SHE'S JUST A KID.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.792
YEAH,BUT SHE--SHE NEEDS
TO DO THIS HER OWN WAY.

13:43.834 --> 13:47.709
ALL RIGHT. WELL, UH,
WE'LL WAIT HERE.

WE'RE STAYING.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.041
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.625
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?
I FEEL LIKE I GOT SHOT.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.083

13:57.125 --> 13:59.166
WE'RE CLOSED.

AAH!

14:06.291 --> 14:08.333

I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.792
IT'S, UH, IT'S BEEN AWHILE

14:09.834 --> 14:12.291
SINCE I'VE HAD TO DEAL
WITH A-A BULLET WOUND.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.041
HE'S MORE

DR. FEELGOOD?

14:17.083 --> 14:19.667
UH, YEAH. HI. HELLO.

14:19.709 --> 14:22.000
MIND-BODY? UH...
I NEED A DOCTOR.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.583
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

14:23.625 --> 14:26.125
YEAH, I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.458
ALL RIGHT, IT'S A GOOD COLOR.
I FEEL A STRONG PULSE.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.458
I NEED A DOCTOR!
I AM A DOCTOR.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.041
ALL RIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE BULLET MISSED THE ARTERY.

14:33.083 --> 14:35.041
PROBABLY JUST NICKED
THE MUSCLE. HE'S LUCKY.

14:35.083 --> 14:39.041
I NEED A DOCTOR FOR ME.

14:39.083 --> 14:43.041
MY WATER JUST BROKE.

14:47.750 --> 14:48.875

YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
OKAY, MA'AM, YOU'RE IN LABOR.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.375
ALL RIGHT, WE REALLY SHOULD TRY

OKAY, OKAY. WELL, THEN LET ME
JUST CALL 9-1-1.

15:03.542 --> 15:06.291

AND YOU'RE DOING IT NOW!

15:10.333 --> 15:12.667
OKAY. OKAY.

15:12.709 --> 15:15.166
OKAY, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M JUST GONNA MAKE

15:15.208 --> 15:17.667
ONE QUICK CALL--
I SAID NO COPS.
DON'T TRY ANYTHING.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.291
I SAID NO COPS!
I JUST WANT TO CALL
A COLLEAGUE

15:19.333 --> 15:23.500
SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU
THE HELP THAT YOU NEED.

15:23.542 --> 15:25.166

15:28.083 --> 15:30.458

15:35.083 --> 15:37.417
ALL RIGHT.

15:37.458 --> 15:41.625
DON'T TRY AND TAKE THE GUN.
THAT'S HOW I GOT SHOT.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.625
OKAY.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.041
OKAY.

15:44.083 --> 15:47.041
HEY, NAOMI, IT'S SAM.
UH, I NEED YOUR HELP.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.041
I'M ABOUT TO, UH,
DELIVER A BABY.

15:49.083 --> 15:51.667
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ON A HOUSE CALL.
I AM. WELL, I WAS.

15:51.709 --> 15:55.041
BUT THEN I RAN INTO
A REALLY NICE LADY,

15:55.083 --> 15:56.583
and she is in labor.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.125
UH, H-HOLD ON, SAM.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.917
HEY, DELL, I NEED YOU TO MONITOR
ASHLEY MINNEHAN'S CONTRACTIONS,

SHE'S DILATED TO 4 CENTIMETERS.
REALLY? A-A BIRTH?

16:05.500 --> 16:07.458

16:07.500 --> 16:08.917
OKAY?
THANKS, YEAH.

16:08.959 --> 16:10.166
UNDERSTAND?
MM-HMM.

16:10.208 --> 16:12.166
ALL RIGHT, NOW, SAM, WAIT,
WHERE ARE YOU?

16:12.208 --> 16:14.166
OKAY, I REALLY DON'T HAVE
THE TIME TO TALK RIGHT NOW,

16:14.208 --> 16:16.583
SO IF WE COULD JUST
GET TO IT?
O-OKAY, FINE.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.542
Um, is she fully dilated?

16:18.583 --> 16:21.542
UH, JUST A MINUTE.

16:23.083 --> 16:26.000
I'M HERE
TO MONITOR YOUR CONTRACTIONS.

16:26.041 --> 16:27.583
ALL RIGHT.

16:27.625 --> 16:31.125
UH, ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP?

16:31.166 --> 16:33.125
OH, NO, NO. I'VE--
I'VE DONE THREE OF THESE.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.125
I JUST SAY A LITTLE PRAYER
AND GO,

16:35.166 --> 16:37.583
AND YOU JUST SIT THERE
AND CATCH THE BABY

16:37.625 --> 16:39.709
LIKE IT'S A FOOTBALL, OKAY?

16:39.750 --> 16:41.542
OH.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.583
(low voice) CAN I JUST SAY,
IT'S A GOOD THING

16:50.625 --> 16:53.583
THAT PETE IS GETTING ME NOW,
BECAUSE I AM HOT.

16:53.625 --> 16:55.709
I AM ON FUEGO.

16:55.750 --> 16:58.500
THIS PLACE IS CRAWLING
WITH COPS.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.458
AND THAT CUTE ONE
OVER THERE,

17:00.500 --> 17:02.458
HE'S TOTALLY--WHAT?

17:02.500 --> 17:03.959
SAM JUST CALLED.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.417
HE'S DELIVERING A BABY.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.041
HE IS?

17:07.083 --> 17:09.041
WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE BIRTHS TODAY?

17:09.083 --> 17:10.792
IT'S LIKE BABYPALOOZA.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.792
GOD, HOW DOES HE GET HIMSELF
INTO THESE THINGS?

17:12.834 --> 17:14.792
I-I SHOULD JUST MIND
MY OWN BUSINESS, RIGHT?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.333
ABOUT SAM?

17:16.375 --> 17:17.792
YEAH, ABOUT SAM,

17:17.834 --> 17:21.041
AND ABOUT YOU ON FUEGO
AND PETE.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.041
YOU ALL--YOU ALL JUST...
LEAP.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.041
AND YOU ARE A THINKER.

17:26.083 --> 17:30.542
SO...
WHAT DO YOU THINK...

17:30.583 --> 17:32.542
ABOUT ME AND PETE?

17:32.583 --> 17:35.000
COME ON, NAI...

17:35.041 --> 17:36.667
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

17:36.709 --> 17:40.375
OKAY. FINE.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.041
YOU SAID YOU WANT CHANGE

17:42.083 --> 17:43.500
AND YOU PICK PETE?

17:43.542 --> 17:46.083
WHAT, A CUTE DOCTOR BOY
WITH NICE EYES?

17:46.125 --> 17:48.709
THAT'S NOT CHANGE.
THAT'S YOUR M.O.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.500
YOU'RE JUST--YOU'RE RUSHING
INTO SOMETHING NEW.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.000
I'M NOT.

17:53.041 --> 17:56.291
I'M... MAKING A DECISION,
UH, TO TAKE A CHANCE

17:56.333 --> 17:58.625
ON SOMETHING
THAT FEELS RIGHT.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.917
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
TO BE ALONE.

18:00.959 --> 18:02.834
SO WHAT IF I AM?
SURPRISE, NAOMI.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.875
I'M SUSCEPTIBLE
TO THE HUMAN CONDITION.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.500
I MEAN, LOOK,
THERE ARE OTHER MEN--

18:07.542 --> 18:09.500
I MEAN,
THERE ARE MEN IN UNIFORM

18:09.542 --> 18:11.917
THAT I CAN NOT BE ALONE WITH
RIGHT NOW.

18:11.959 --> 18:15.500
I DID NOT PICK PETE BECAUSE I'M
DESPERATE AND LONELY.

18:15.542 --> 18:17.125
PETE IS MY CHOICE.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.041
YOU ASKED.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.041
OH. OH.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.667
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:26.709 --> 18:28.041
THE BABY'S COMING NOW.

18:28.083 --> 18:31.208
WHAT? NO, UM...
ARE YOU SURE?

18:31.250 --> 18:34.208
IT'S COMING.
YOU HAVE TO CATCH THE BABY.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.542
OH. OH.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.125
OKAY.

18:38.166 --> 18:39.500
OH. OH.

18:39.542 --> 18:42.291
NO, NO, I-I CAN'T DO THIS.
I HAVE TO CALL NAOMI.

18:42.333 --> 18:45.083
NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME!

18:45.125 --> 18:47.583
(telephone beeps)
NAOMI!

18:47.625 --> 18:49.750
SUSAN, YOUR CONTRACTIONS
ARE FIVE MINUTES APART.

18:49.792 --> 18:52.750
SO... IT WON'T BE
TOO MUCH LONGER.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.291
I'M READY.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.875
YOU REALLY ARE, SUSAN.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.875
YOU ARE TOTALLY PREPARED
FOR THIS.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.375
OH, GOD.

19:00.417 --> 19:03.041
TODAY.

19:03.083 --> 19:06.667
MY SON'S BIRTHDAY IS TODAY.

19:06.709 --> 19:09.041
(breathes deeply)

19:09.083 --> 19:12.542
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:12.583 --> 19:15.500
TIMING YOUR CONTRACTIONS.
YOU BEEN HAVING PAIN LONG?

19:15.542 --> 19:17.625
YEAH, SINCE I GOT UP
THIS MORNING.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

19:17.667 --> 19:20.208
I WAS THINKING THAT I NEED
TO ROB A CONVENIENCE STORE

19:20.250 --> 19:22.792
BECAUSE I HAVE NO MONEY
FOR DIAPERS OR FOOD

19:22.834 --> 19:25.125
OR TO PUT A ROOF
OVER MY BABY'S HEAD!
OKAY, MA'AM--

19:25.166 --> 19:26.583
THAT'S NOT A REASON.

19:26.625 --> 19:29.375
NORMAL PEOPLE
DON'T HOLD UP STORES, KELLY.

19:29.417 --> 19:33.834
KELLY? SO YOU TWO DIDN'T
JUST MEET TODAY, DID YOU?

19:33.875 --> 19:36.041
THAT'S MY BABY
YOU'RE DELIVERING.
(Kelly groans)

19:36.083 --> 19:39.417
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
(groans)

19:39.458 --> 19:40.917
(baby crying)
DELL...

19:40.959 --> 19:43.041
IT JUST--IT JUST HAPPENED.
I-I-I SWEAR.

19:43.083 --> 19:46.792
IT WAS THE FASTEST DELIVERY
I'VE EVER SEEN.
OKAY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, DELL.

19:46.834 --> 19:49.166
OKAY,
FIRST WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

19:49.208 --> 19:51.166
IS WE'RE GONNA CUT
THE UMBILICAL CORD.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.166
YEAH. ALL RIGHT, SEE?
RIGHT HERE. YOU SEE?

19:53.208 --> 19:55.208
YEAH, OKAY, OKAY.
ABOUT A HALF AN INCH.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.208
YOU GOT IT?
THERE WE GO. YEAH.
KEEP THE BABY LOW FOR ME.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.750
THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT.
(singsongy) THERE YOU GO.

20:00.792 --> 20:03.542
HOW IS SHE?
(normal voice)
OH, SHE'S GREAT.

20:03.583 --> 20:07.458
SHE'S GREAT. SHE'S, UM, OH!
SHE'S--SHE'S A BOY.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.959
(crying)

20:09.000 --> 20:11.041
CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S A--IT'S A BOY.

20:11.083 --> 20:14.041
NO!

20:14.083 --> 20:17.625
YOU SHOVE THAT BOY BACK UP THERE
AND PULL OUT A GIRL!

20:17.667 --> 20:19.625
(baby cries)

20:22.959 --> 20:25.417
(baby crying)
ONE GIRL.
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

20:25.458 --> 20:27.291
WELL, UH, YOUR--YOUR ULTRASOUND
WAS QUITE A WHILE AGO,

20:27.333 --> 20:29.041
AND, UH, MISINTERPRETATIONS
CAN HAPPEN

20:29.083 --> 20:30.208
THAT EARLY ON
IN THE PREGNANCY.

20:30.250 --> 20:33.041
I BOUGHT A LITTLE PINK DRESS
WITH SOME LITTLE PINK SHOES

20:33.083 --> 20:35.041
FOR A LITTLE PINK GIRL.

20:35.083 --> 20:38.041
AND I'M NOT LEAVING
UNTIL I GET SOME PINKNESS!

20:38.083 --> 20:41.834
(crying continues)

20:41.875 --> 20:44.834
ALL RIGHT, KELLY, I NEED YOU
TO TAKE SLOW, DEEP BREATHS.

20:44.875 --> 20:48.041
BABIES TAKE MONEY, DAMON.
WHAT, YOU THINK I WASN'T
GONNA TURN YOU INTO THE POLICE?

20:48.083 --> 20:49.834
WHAT, YOU THINK I WAS JUST
GONNA LET YOU ROB

20:49.875 --> 20:52.667
THE PLACE WHERE I WORK
AND NOT TURN YOU IN?
YOU OWE ME.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.208
I--YOU'RE CRAZY!
I'M NOT CRAZY.
I'M HORMONAL.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.875
TELL HIM I'M HORMONAL.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.875
UH, I THINK THAT MAYBE
THERE'S A NEW WORD

20:59.917 --> 21:02.125
FOR WHAT YOU ARE.

21:04.375 --> 21:07.291
I COULDN'T RAISE THIS BABY
ON MY OWN.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.417
YOU WOULDN'T GIVE ME ANY MONEY,
SO I HAD TO COME AND TAKE IT.

21:10.458 --> 21:12.041
YOU LEFT ME WITH NOTHING.

21:12.083 --> 21:15.041
WHY DO YOU THINK I TOOK
THIS JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE?

21:15.083 --> 21:18.041
I TOLD YOU, I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF THIS BABY.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.834
BUT YOU LEFT ME.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.458
YES. I LEFT YOU.

21:22.500 --> 21:26.083
BUT I WON'T LEAVE
OUR BABY. LET ME HELP.

21:28.166 --> 21:31.041
I HAVE--
I HAVE TO JUST SAY,

21:31.083 --> 21:33.250
IT SOUNDS LIKE DAMON'S
AN OKAY GUY.

21:33.291 --> 21:35.125
SO, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET--
STAY BACK!

21:35.166 --> 21:37.250
(Sam) WHOA.
STAY BACK!

21:37.291 --> 21:39.917
OKAY, EVERYBODY, STOP.
(groaning)

21:39.959 --> 21:41.125
JUST STOP.

21:41.166 --> 21:44.667
WE ARE GOING TO LISTEN
TO THE LADY WITH THE GUN.

21:44.709 --> 21:46.667
I CAN'T TAKE IT.
OH. OH.

21:46.709 --> 21:48.583
DOES EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND?
(groans)

21:48.625 --> 21:51.583
KEEP TAKING THOSE LONG,
SLOW, DEEP BREATHS, OKAY?

21:51.625 --> 21:52.959
(inhales)

21:53.000 --> 21:54.166
(exhales)
(exhales)

21:54.208 --> 21:56.583
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.583
ASHLEY MINNEHAN WILL NOT
BOND WITH THIS BABY.

21:58.625 --> 22:01.083
SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT HIM.
SHE WAS EXPECTING A GIRL.

22:01.125 --> 22:03.125
SHE'S HORMONAL, SO SHE'S AT RISK
FOR POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION.

22:03.166 --> 22:05.041
CAN YOU TALK TO HER?

22:05.083 --> 22:09.166
SURE. LET ME JUST MAKE SURE
SUSAN'S READY FOR ME TO GO.
OKAY.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.959
MM.

22:15.583 --> 22:17.083
MY PLACE, 8:00.

22:17.125 --> 22:18.083
DONE.

22:18.125 --> 22:20.083
I CAN'T RAISE
FOUR BOYS ON MY OWN.

22:20.125 --> 22:22.834
WELL, HAVE YOU, UH--
YOU HAVE YOUR HUSBAND.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.834
HE CAN HELP.
OH, YEAH, SURE.

22:24.875 --> 22:28.125
YESTERDAY HE TAUGHT THE BOYS
HOW TO BURP THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.125
NOT THE RIGHT KIND
OF HELP.

22:30.166 --> 22:34.125
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO PUTS
BATTERIES IN THE SMOKE ALARM,

22:34.166 --> 22:37.208
THE ONE WHO PUTS THE COVER
ON THE SWIMMING POOL AT NIGHT.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.208
HAVE YOU TRIED
TALKING TO PATRICK?

22:39.250 --> 22:41.208
OH, HE SAYS
I'M JUST BEING SILLY

22:41.250 --> 22:43.041
BECAUSE NOTHING BAD
EVER HAPPENS.

22:43.083 --> 22:45.041
BUT THAT'S ONLY
BECAUSE I MAKE SURE

22:45.083 --> 22:47.041
NOTHING BAD EVER HAPPENS.

22:47.083 --> 22:49.625
ASHLEY...
YOU ARE A GREAT MOM.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.000
(sighs)

22:51.041 --> 22:53.041
THE BOYS LIKE HIM
BETTER THAN ME

22:53.083 --> 22:55.625
BECAUSE HE PLAYS WITH THEM.

22:55.667 --> 22:59.041
I JUST WANTED ONE GIRL

22:59.083 --> 23:01.041
SO SHE COULD BE MINE.

23:01.083 --> 23:03.041
AND THEN
I WOULDN'T CARE SO MUCH

23:03.083 --> 23:05.750
ABOUT HAVING TO
DO IT ALL MYSELF.

23:05.792 --> 23:08.250
WELL, MAYBE YOU HAVE
ANOTHER BOY FOR A REASON.

23:08.291 --> 23:12.000
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
A GREAT MOM,

23:12.041 --> 23:14.709
AND YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE
YOUR BOYS TO BE GOOD MEN.

23:14.750 --> 23:17.000
AND THE WORLD
NEEDS GOOD MEN.

23:18.542 --> 23:20.709
(sighs)

23:20.750 --> 23:23.208
I WANT A GIRL.

23:27.083 --> 23:30.041
WHOA. I'VE BEEN KIND OF
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

23:30.083 --> 23:32.291
NO, YOU HAVEN'T.
YES, I HAVE--

23:32.333 --> 23:34.291
ALL MY RULES--
BUT THINGS WORK OUT BETTER

23:34.333 --> 23:37.208
WHEN I STAY FOCUSED,
DON'T LET MY MIND WANDER.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.458
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.834
(exhales deeply)

23:41.875 --> 23:44.375
YOU CAN'T REALLY--
I MEAN...

23:47.083 --> 23:50.000
THERE'S NO PLAN FOR
DOING THIS ALONE, IS THERE?

23:52.250 --> 23:55.208
LOOK, THERE'S A ROOMFUL OF
JASON'S FRIENDS FROM THE FORCE

23:55.250 --> 23:56.667
HERE FOR YOU.

23:56.709 --> 23:59.083
YOU COULD BRING SOMEONE IN.

23:59.125 --> 24:01.166
THEY DON'T GET
HOW LONELY IT IS

24:01.208 --> 24:02.834
SINCE HE DIED.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.583
PROBABLY NOT.

24:07.458 --> 24:11.041
I LOST MY WIFE
A WHILE AGO.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.875
I'M SORRY.

24:12.917 --> 24:16.000
IT GETS BETTER.

24:16.041 --> 24:18.750
DOES IT REALLY
GET BETTER?

24:18.792 --> 24:22.458
OR DO YOU JUST
BURY IT DEEPER?

24:22.500 --> 24:24.250
I DON'T KNOW.

24:24.291 --> 24:27.041
MAYBE IT DEPENDS
ON HOW YOU LEFT THINGS.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.333
THEY WERE GOOD.

24:30.792 --> 24:35.041
HE WAS SO EXCITED
ABOUT THIS BABY.

24:35.083 --> 24:38.083
HOLD ON TO THAT.

24:40.709 --> 24:42.667
OH.

24:42.709 --> 24:44.667
OH, HERE COMES
ANOTHER ONE. OW.
OKAY.

24:44.709 --> 24:46.667
STAND UP?

24:46.709 --> 24:49.208
OKAY.
YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.834
BREATHE.

24:50.875 --> 24:53.500
(Kelly screams)

24:53.542 --> 24:55.500
(Sam) THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
THAT'S GOOD.

24:55.542 --> 24:57.792
JUST LIKE THAT, KELLY.
OW! OW!

24:57.834 --> 25:00.041
OH, GOD.
UH, YOU MAY BE
FULLY DILATED.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.792
HERE YOU GO.
IS THE BABY OKAY?

25:01.834 --> 25:03.917
PLEASE MAKE IT STOP.
MAKE IT STOP, DR. PHIL.

25:03.959 --> 25:07.542
WELL, NOT--IT'S NOT PHIL.
IT'S FEEL, LIKE "FEEL GOOD."

25:07.583 --> 25:10.000
OKAY, NEVER MIND.
I WANT AN EPIDURAL.

25:10.041 --> 25:13.417
OH, PLEASE.
EPI--YEAH, WELL, WE'RE
IN A CONVENIENCE STORE SO...

25:13.458 --> 25:15.792
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.
SHE'S IN PAIN. DO SOMETHING.

25:15.834 --> 25:18.750
(panting)

25:18.792 --> 25:20.542
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
KELLY, LISTEN TO ME.

25:20.583 --> 25:24.583
ALL RIGHT, YOUR--YOUR MIND IS
A VERY POWERFUL HEALING TOOL.

25:24.625 --> 25:27.667
SO IF YOU CAN RELAX
YOUR MIND,

25:27.709 --> 25:29.667
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RELAX
YOUR BODY. ALL RIGHT?

25:29.709 --> 25:31.458
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

25:31.500 --> 25:33.458
SO TRY TO RELAX YOUR MIND.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.667
I JUST WANTED A HOME
TO RAISE MY BABY IN,

25:35.709 --> 25:37.667
AND NOW
I'VE RUINED EVERYTHING,

25:37.709 --> 25:40.041
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO RELAX MY MIND!
OH! OW!

25:40.083 --> 25:42.000
(groans)
WHOA.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.583
OKAY, GOOD. YOU'RE READY
TO START PUSHING.

25:47.625 --> 25:50.875
NICE AND EASY.
OH. OH.

25:50.917 --> 25:55.583
I DROPPED IT.
I DROPPED THE LIST.
WELL, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.667
WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.
NO, I--YOU KNOW,
I SHOULD'VE LAMINATED IT.

25:57.709 --> 26:00.542
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?
WE DON'T NEED IT, SUSAN.

26:00.583 --> 26:03.208
I NEED IT. I NEED TO GET
OUTTA HERE. I NEED IT.
WHOA, WHOA, SUSAN,
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

26:03.250 --> 26:05.417
JUST GRAB ON TO THE HANDLES
IF YOU NEED SUPPORT.

26:05.458 --> 26:09.208
TRY TO RELAX. RELAX.
NO, I CAN'T. I CAN'T PUSH.

26:09.250 --> 26:11.417
YES, YOU CAN.
SUSAN, THE BABY'S COMING.

26:11.458 --> 26:14.250
NO, SOMETHING'S WRONG.
I CAN FEEL IT.

26:14.291 --> 26:17.458
NOTHING IS WRONG, SUSAN.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
WHERE THE HELL IS JASON?

26:17.500 --> 26:19.583
YOU'RE IN CONTROL.

26:19.625 --> 26:22.041
NO!
JUST STAY WITH IT.

26:22.083 --> 26:24.250
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE!
HE'S--WHERE IS HE?

26:24.291 --> 26:26.583
(crying)
OKAY, SUSAN.

26:26.625 --> 26:31.083
SUSAN, THIS LITTLE BABY
IS READY TO COME RIGHT NOW.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.625
WE ARE READY,
JUST LIKE YOU PLANNED.

26:33.667 --> 26:35.125
NO, NO. HE'S--HE'S...

26:35.166 --> 26:36.875
SHH.

26:36.917 --> 26:39.041
OH! OH!

26:39.083 --> 26:40.500
OH, MY GOD.

26:40.542 --> 26:42.417
TRY TO BREATHE.

26:42.458 --> 26:44.667
MY JASON... MY...

26:44.709 --> 26:46.542
(sobs) OH, HE'S DEAD.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.750
OH, HE'S DEAD!

26:48.792 --> 26:51.625
HE'S DEAD.
HE'S REALLY DEAD.

26:51.667 --> 26:53.041
(sobs)

26:53.083 --> 26:55.208
AH! AH!

26:55.250 --> 26:57.667
OKAY, SUSAN, SUSAN,
WHEN YOU HYPERVENTILATE,

26:57.709 --> 26:59.667
YOU LOWER
THE BABY'S HEART RATE.

26:59.709 --> 27:02.250
ALL RIGHT, IF WE DON'T
START PUSHING RIGHT NOW,

27:02.291 --> 27:04.709
THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU WILL LOSE THE BABY.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.250
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

27:06.291 --> 27:07.500
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.375
(cries)

27:09.417 --> 27:11.917
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE ALONE.

27:11.959 --> 27:15.041
OH! OH, THIS WASN'T MY CHOICE.

27:15.083 --> 27:17.500
NO! I CHOSE JASON!

27:17.542 --> 27:20.458
I DIDN'T WANT THIS.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.458
(breathing rapidly)

27:23.500 --> 27:27.709
I DIDN'T... AAH!

27:27.750 --> 27:29.041
AAH!

27:29.083 --> 27:31.458
(Addison) SUSAN.

27:31.500 --> 27:32.709
SUSAN.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.500
SUSAN, HONEY, LISTEN TO ME.

27:35.542 --> 27:38.166
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.917
OKAY?

27:39.959 --> 27:42.750
I AM RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

27:42.792 --> 27:45.041
OKAY?

27:45.083 --> 27:47.333
NOW... YOU'RE NOT ALONE,

27:47.375 --> 27:49.041
AND WE'RE GONNA PUSH.

27:49.083 --> 27:50.917
KEEP BREATHING.

27:50.959 --> 27:52.917

27:52.959 --> 27:54.625
PUSH.

27:54.667 --> 27:55.625
(screaming)

27:55.667 --> 27:58.083

27:58.125 --> 27:59.750
(screams)

28:02.083 --> 28:04.000
(Addison) GOOD GIRL.
GOOD, GOOD.

28:04.041 --> 28:07.000
GOOD. GOOD.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

28:07.041 --> 28:09.041
NOW LET'S BRING YOUR SON
OUT HERE, OKAY?

28:09.083 --> 28:11.542
ALL RIGHT. READY.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.041
(groaning)

28:13.083 --> 28:17.125
OH, GOD. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE. OH, GOD.
I CAN HELP.

28:17.166 --> 28:20.000
YOU STAY BACK.
YOU WANT TO KILL ME,

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE.

28:22.208 --> 28:25.041
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE.
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE OUR BABY.

28:25.083 --> 28:27.166
HEY, HEY, HEY, MAN.
S-SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

28:27.208 --> 28:31.041
KELLY...
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

28:31.083 --> 28:34.166
YOU TRIED TO ROB
A CONVENIENCE STORE TODAY.

28:34.208 --> 28:35.625
WHEN THIS IS ALL DONE,

28:35.667 --> 28:38.166
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ANSWER
TO THE COPS.

28:38.208 --> 28:39.625
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY

28:39.667 --> 28:42.083
GONNA TRY AND TAKE YOUR BABY
AWAY FROM YOU.

28:42.125 --> 28:44.834
BUT I THINK THAT, UH,

28:44.875 --> 28:46.917
THAT MAYBE YOU'RE LUCKY
BECAUSE...

28:46.959 --> 28:48.875
YOUR BABY'S FATHER,

28:48.917 --> 28:52.625
HE REALLY WANTS TO TAKE CARE
OF YOUR CHILD.

28:52.667 --> 28:54.709
NO, HE LEFT ME.

28:56.625 --> 29:00.166
OKAY, IF YOU WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR BABY,

29:00.208 --> 29:02.458
YOU GOTTA PUT DOWN
THAT GUN.

29:04.125 --> 29:07.166
I CAN'T.
YOU'LL CALL THE COPS.

29:07.208 --> 29:10.875
I'M NOT GONNA CALL
THE COPS.

29:10.917 --> 29:14.041
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TRUST ME.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.959
CAN YOU TRUST ME?

29:19.709 --> 29:23.041
ALL RIGHT,
THEN PUT DOWN THE GUN.

29:35.792 --> 29:37.041
(groans)

29:37.083 --> 29:39.041
(breathes deeply)

29:39.083 --> 29:43.500
OKAY, NOW, UH,
LET'S GET THIS BABY OUT.

29:43.542 --> 29:45.041
YOU DIDN'T CALL THE COPS.

29:45.083 --> 29:48.041
NOPE.
I DIDN'T CALL THE COPS.

29:51.083 --> 29:53.291
ALL RIGHT.
(Kelly groans)

29:55.166 --> 29:57.291
TIME TO SEE MY NEW BOY?

29:57.333 --> 30:00.166
HOW AWESOME IS THAT?
ANOTHER LITTLE DUDE.

30:00.208 --> 30:03.041
