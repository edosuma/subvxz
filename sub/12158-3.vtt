00:01.634 --> 00:02.768
"last man standing" is recorded

00:02.770 --> 00:06.538
<i>In front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:06.540 --> 00:08.974
Okay, so, we just learned
the coolest new move

00:08.976 --> 00:10.676
In hand-to-hand
combat training.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.112
Come on, dad.
Take a swing at me.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.114
Mm. Ask your mom.

00:17.283 --> 00:19.685
Mike, I am not gonna hit
our daughter.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.487
You're darn right,
you're not.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.623
You'd end up facedown on the
ground with a knee in your back.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.624
[ chuckles ]

00:25.626 --> 00:27.726
Way to ruin
the surprise, dad.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.162
Hey. Thanks for driving me
to class, Kyle.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.363
Now, I'll need you
to drive me again

00:31.365 --> 00:32.965
To my 8:00 a.M. Class
in the morning.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.567
Yeah, no problem.
Ooh, and as a treat,
if you wait around,

00:35.569 --> 00:37.803
After class,
you get to drive me home.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.238
Great. I'll just hang out
in the quad.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.973
Kill some time
playing some hacky sack.

00:40.975 --> 00:43.976
Kyle.
Do you have your own sack?

00:46.913 --> 00:48.981
Sure.

00:48.983 --> 00:52.017
Surprised to hear that.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.786
Okay. Bye.

00:55.155 --> 00:59.158
I'll see ya.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.393
How's, uh --
how's college going, honey?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.429
It's okay.
Just okay?

01:03.431 --> 01:04.997
I don't know. It's not
as much fun as I'd hoped.

01:04.999 --> 01:06.098
Like,
everybody's so focused

01:06.100 --> 01:08.500
On reading and studying
and learning.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.069
Yeah, that's
a slippery slope.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.237
Next thing you know,
you'll be graduating

01:12.239 --> 01:15.607
And getting a job
and working for a living.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.010
I just don't feel all involved
like I did in high school.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.112
You know, after class,
everybody hangs out

01:20.114 --> 01:22.514
In the dorms or the student
center, and I just come home.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.183
Well, do you think
you'd make more friends

01:24.185 --> 01:25.851
If you weren't spending
all your time with Kyle?

01:25.853 --> 01:28.120
He's the only person I know
at school.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.721
But he doesn't go there.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.191
Yeah, but he's got more friends
than I do.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.026
Like, that whole
hacky-sack crowd --

01:34.028 --> 01:36.061
I'm not even really sure
any of them go there, either.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.430
They're all like 40.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.865
I feel so bad for her.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.101
It's rough starting over
in a new environment.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.103
Yes,
life is so unfair

01:44.105 --> 01:46.105
To pretty,
young 18-year-old girls.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.143
It's okay if she feels bad as
long as she keeps her grades up.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.544
Yeah, well, college
is not just about grades.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.380
It's about new experiences
and meeting new people,

01:55.382 --> 01:57.583
Staying up all night
drinking coffee

01:57.585 --> 02:00.986
And arguing about divesting
from south africa.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.254
I've been there, right?

02:02.256 --> 02:03.555
I've been in the dorm room
next to those people.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.959
We were up all night
arguing about...

02:06.961 --> 02:09.795
[ slurring ]
...Who's gonna get more beer.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.597
Anyway, I just worry

02:11.599 --> 02:13.999
That if she doesn't have
a social life,

02:14.001 --> 02:16.235
She's gonna lose all interest
in college.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.070
Well, she had such a good
social life in high school,

02:18.072 --> 02:20.906
They almost asked her back
for her fifth year.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.475
Stop it! I'm not gonna fall for
that "free punch" thing again!

02:23.477 --> 02:26.345
I understand
you're angry.
Mm.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.280
I bet it'd feel real good
to hit me with this lamp.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.681
Eve.
What?

02:29.683 --> 02:31.283
Oh, no, look.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.018
I'm distracted while talking
to my mother.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.888
Anyone could
come up behind me and just...

02:38.458 --> 02:41.460
[ sighs ]
just forget it.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.662
It's like I'm living
with the ghandis.

02:43.664 --> 02:47.466
Mandy, honey, um, there's
something I'm worried about.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.035
Yeah, mom, don't worry.
I've been taking it every day.

02:50.037 --> 02:53.205
Sorry. What -- what have you
been taking every day?

02:53.207 --> 02:55.207
Vitamins.

02:55.209 --> 02:59.044
But -- but this isn't
about the vitamins, but --

02:59.046 --> 03:00.279
Good girl.

03:01.981 --> 03:04.316
Honey, come here a minute.
Come here.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.318
When
I went to ohio state,

03:06.320 --> 03:08.687
I-I was worried
that I wasn't fitting in,

03:08.689 --> 03:11.123
So you know what I did
to boost my social life?

03:11.125 --> 03:12.524
She spent a lot of time
in the commons going,

03:12.526 --> 03:16.795
"I can't get knocked up.
I just took my vitamins."

03:18.198 --> 03:22.034
I joined a sorority.
Kappa kappa nu.

03:22.036 --> 03:24.036
Wait. I thought dad said
I shouldn't join a sorority.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.838
That's because sororities
rob you of your individualism,

03:26.840 --> 03:28.373
Turning people
into drones --

03:28.375 --> 03:31.176
And not the cool kind
that shoot missiles.

03:31.178 --> 03:34.179
Your dad is not a fan
of the greek system.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.148
Because the greeks
have no system.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.983
They've
step-by-step dismantled

03:37.985 --> 03:40.018
The whole economic system
in europe!

03:40.020 --> 03:42.154
You know,
I think it's about time

03:42.156 --> 03:43.722
The germans powered up
those panzers.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.591
And this time,
we might fight with them!

03:49.262 --> 03:50.862
I don't agree
with your father.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.197
A german-led world war iii

03:52.199 --> 03:57.169
Is definitely not preferable
to you joining a sorority.

03:57.171 --> 04:01.240
-- Captions by vitac --

04:01.242 --> 04:04.376
â™ª

04:04.378 --> 04:06.378
Hey, Ed.
Huh?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.947
You got your deposition ready
for the jetski lawsuit?

04:08.949 --> 04:11.950
Don't tell me someone got hurt
on one of our jet skis.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.952
Ed, the polish guy --
jetski.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.521
Got trapped
in one of our tents.
Oh.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.524
Depositions
and paperwork.

04:19.526 --> 04:22.127
It's --
it's all so boring!

04:22.129 --> 04:24.296
And I'm working on that
loading-dock problem.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.731
There is no problem
on the loading dock, Ed.

04:25.733 --> 04:26.898
We just need to hire
more guys.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.867
Aha!
That's just what they want.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.236
Aha!
Because it's a good idea.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.372
I've been thinking
about this.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.307
I saw this tv show
Friday night

04:35.309 --> 04:37.376
Where an executive
puts on a disguise

04:37.378 --> 04:39.745
And gets a job
with his own company...
Yeah.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.946
...To find out what his
employees are up to.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.781
It's called
"incognito boss."

04:42.783 --> 04:44.383
Stupidest show ever.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.385
Of all the good things
to watch on Friday night,

04:46.387 --> 04:49.121
Why would anybody
watch that?

04:49.123 --> 04:52.124
I get into a disguise,
I blend in on the loading dock

04:52.126 --> 04:54.259
To find out
who's slacking off.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.094
I don't think you'll find them
slacking off.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.398
They'll be trying to help
this old dude lift heavy boxes.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.433
He's not old.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.236
Troy fontaine is only 53.

05:04.238 --> 05:06.305
And who's troy fontaine?

05:06.307 --> 05:07.906
My alter ego.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.808
Look, if I'm gonna fool
anybody,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.843
I have to develop
a whole persona.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.446
They say that travolta
starts his characters

05:14.448 --> 05:15.814
By finding their walk.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.649
I've been working on this, now.
How's this? Look.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.321
Keep doing it.
I like it.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.323
Yeah, just a little
tiny bit faster.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.325
I like it. There you go.
That's great, Ed.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.560
I've been
thinking about --

05:31.030 --> 05:33.465
Oh, my god! Hey!
Twinsies!

05:33.467 --> 05:35.033
I am so glad
my mom convinced me

05:35.035 --> 05:37.035
To join
her old sorority.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.370
Yeah, but isn't it
gonna be awkward

05:38.372 --> 05:40.405
Hanging out with a bunch
of women your mom's age?

05:42.275 --> 05:45.344
Wow,
she's holding up great!

05:45.346 --> 05:47.145
Sister!
Mandy: Sister!

05:47.147 --> 05:48.847
[ both squeal, giggle ]

05:48.849 --> 05:50.849
Yay! [ chuckles ]
mwah! Mwah!

05:50.851 --> 05:52.217
Aww!

05:52.219 --> 05:53.819
You'll be at
the rally today, right?
Oh.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.389
We're holding a surprise
fundraiser to help fight asthma.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.392
Although, we did tell all
the people who have asthma,

06:00.394 --> 06:03.295
Because surprise can actually
bring on a pretty bad attack.

06:03.297 --> 06:05.397
Can my boyfriend come?

06:05.399 --> 06:06.965
Only if he has asthma.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.300
Sadly, he doesn't.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.535
But I'll still see you there,
little sis.

06:10.537 --> 06:14.373
[ chuckling ] okay. Bye!
Hey. I'm Kyle, by the --
okay.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.977
Isn't jenna great?
Yeah. I love her.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.380
Yeah.
But I'm bummed.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.981
I was hoping
that we could hang out

06:22.983 --> 06:24.416
After
your classes today.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.418
Kyle,
I'm a kappa nu newbie.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.820
You know, I really got to
show up for these events.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.390
Well, then maybe I can just
hang here in class with you.

06:31.392 --> 06:34.025
Okay. I guess.
Are you sure you won't be bored?

06:34.027 --> 06:36.361
Are you kidding me?
I love astronomy.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.497
Have you gotten
to capricorns yet?

06:38.499 --> 06:39.865
Oh, Kyle, this is
<i>intro</i> to astronomy.

06:39.867 --> 06:43.001
I'm pretty sure they get to
horoscopes next semester.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.770
It's a good thing
capricorns are able to deal

06:44.772 --> 06:46.772
With crushing
disappointment.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.612
But seriously, I'm a natural
on the loadin' dock.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.247
Maybe it's because
of the two years I spent

06:55.249 --> 06:57.048
As a stevedore in guam.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.417
That and the fact
that I was raised

06:58.419 --> 07:00.419
By an abusive
geometry instructor,

07:00.421 --> 07:02.354
So I'm extremely good
with shapes.

07:02.356 --> 07:03.522
All right.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.891
Okay, guys,
lunch is over.

07:05.893 --> 07:09.361
Hey, troy.
Nice job stacking those boxes.

07:09.363 --> 07:10.962
I'm glad you like it.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.564
But if my old man
saw that job,

07:12.566 --> 07:14.399
He'd throw me down
a fire escape.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.934
[ laughs ]

07:19.405 --> 07:20.572
Hey, j.J.
Hey.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.641
Is Ed down here?
I haven't seen him.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.342
Huh?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.481
Ed?

07:29.483 --> 07:33.084
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.487
Don't blow my cover.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.088
Troy fontaine
has gotten to the bottom

07:37.090 --> 07:39.591
Of the productivity problem
down here.

07:39.593 --> 07:44.429
Could it be that productivity
problem <i>is</i> troy fontaine?

07:44.431 --> 07:46.598
Troy fontaine
is not a slacker!

07:46.600 --> 07:48.433
Sorry.

07:48.435 --> 07:51.603
Troy fontaine
also has a temper.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.971
You were right, mikey.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.439
Nobody's slacking off
down here.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.774
We just need more men
on the dock.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.075
I got an idea.
Yeah.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.477
Why don't we invite everyone
to bring their alter egos?

07:58.479 --> 07:59.911
We'll double
the workforce.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.780
Look, t-these guys

08:01.782 --> 08:03.982
Are the salt of the earth,
huh?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.318
We all went out for beers
last night. Yeah.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.653
They did not have nice things
to say about you.

08:10.690 --> 08:14.759
I got the ball rolling by
telling them how much you make.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.633
I got piles of stuff upstairs
for you to sign.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.001
You got to get
back upstairs.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.437
I know. There's always stuff
for me to sign, Mike.

08:25.439 --> 08:28.640
I miss being a regular guy
and doing an honest day's work.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.443
This experience has put me
in touch with who I really am.

08:31.445 --> 08:34.212
Yeah? A rubber nose
and a steven seagal wig

08:34.214 --> 08:42.220
Will do that to a guy.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.555
Kristin: Boyd, hurry!
We've got to go!

08:43.557 --> 08:45.557
So, Ed made up a whole fake
back story about himself

08:45.559 --> 08:47.526
Just to trick people
into trusting him?
Yep.

08:47.528 --> 08:50.529
Basically, he's obama.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.665
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where is your other shoe?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.467
I don't know.
Do I need it?

08:55.469 --> 08:57.536
Yes.
We are a two-shoe family.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.904
Go find it.
I wish I were a monkey.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.705
I wouldn't have to
wear shoes.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.507
I wish
you were a monkey, too.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.643
Then I'd have someone
to smoke cigars with.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.177
[ chuckles ]

09:06.179 --> 09:08.580
Ah, he better find
that shoe.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.682
I cannot afford
to get him another pair.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.585
Looks like Ryan might be
going out on strike.
What?!

09:13.587 --> 09:16.521
Need a guy to walk out
on the job, Ryan's your man.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.523
Honey, I-I thought
the beer-truck drivers

09:18.525 --> 09:20.058
Were close
to an agreement.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.193
Yeah. They all agreed
to go on strike.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.930
But, you know, Ryan's optimistic
management will cave.

09:24.932 --> 09:28.600
Where are they ever gonna find
truck drivers who like beer?

09:28.602 --> 09:30.769
[ inhales sharply ]
hey!

09:30.771 --> 09:32.571
Boyd! Whoo-hoo!
We found your shoe!

09:32.573 --> 09:34.072
"we"?

09:34.074 --> 09:37.275
Here you go.
Catch that, huh?

09:38.678 --> 09:40.912
This is what happens
when you sign a kid up

09:40.914 --> 09:42.948
For puppeteering
and not little league.

09:42.950 --> 09:46.084
Come on. Okay? Oh, but
the ground's wet, so hop. Hop!

09:46.086 --> 09:48.520
Hop! Bye!

09:48.522 --> 09:50.722
Ryan's going on strike.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.757
[ sighs ]
Kristin cannot catch a break.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.026
And this kid
can't catch a shoe.

09:56.295 --> 09:58.029
Am I the only one
worried about that?

09:58.031 --> 10:00.632
And now she's gonna
have to work extra hours,

10:00.634 --> 10:02.801
College is gonna get pushed
further down the road.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.402
I mean,
we all love Ryan --

10:04.404 --> 10:06.237
No.

10:06.239 --> 10:09.608
Kristin got too involved
with a high-school boyfriend,

10:09.610 --> 10:11.810
And it basically
derailed her life.

10:11.812 --> 10:15.447
And produced a kid
who can't catch a shoe.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.482
This is a danger--
whoa! Whoa!

10:17.484 --> 10:19.050
What are you --
what are you dressed as?

10:19.052 --> 10:20.719
I'm a farm girl.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.687
E-I-e-I-no!

10:26.626 --> 10:28.760
Dad, we had a hoedown
at my sorority tonight,

10:28.762 --> 10:31.262
And all of the other girls
were dressed exactly like this.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.764
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.133
Well, this is exactly why I told
you I don't like sororities.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.335
Why not?
Because t-t-they turned her
into a robot --

10:37.337 --> 10:39.638
And not the fun kind
that box other robots.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.574
Oh, honey, stop.
It's just as a party theme.

10:42.576 --> 10:44.576
Yeah.
It's groupthink,
and I refuse to support

10:44.578 --> 10:47.779
Any organization that makes its
members wear certain clothes.

10:47.781 --> 10:48.179
Looking sharp, Eve.

10:51.917 --> 10:55.253
Oh, my god.
What -- what is this?

10:55.255 --> 10:56.488
I went to a hoedown.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.689
[ sighs ] well...

10:57.691 --> 10:59.658
They're down a ho
now that you left.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.129
Get out of here, you.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.765
Mandy, honey, did, uh --
did you have a good time?
Hmm?

11:06.767 --> 11:08.800
Yeah. I just felt bad
'cause I couldn't bring Kyle.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.136
Yeah, you know, I know
when I was -- was a kappa,

11:11.138 --> 11:13.338
They frowned on pledges
having boyfriends.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.773
Yeah. I mean,
they don't exactly frown.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.707
It's more kind of
like this face.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.142
It's like...

11:17.144 --> 11:18.777
Or...Not like that.
Mm. Yes.

11:18.779 --> 11:19.711
It was like...

11:19.713 --> 11:20.945
Okay.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.280
[ clears throat ]

11:22.282 --> 11:24.849
Or like...
All right.
All right, honey.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.785
Yeah, but you understand
w-whatever the face, okay,

11:26.787 --> 11:29.721
They just want you completely
involved in the sorority.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.023
I know, but then there
won't be any time for Kyle.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.826
Honey, c-come here.
You know...

11:34.828 --> 11:36.194
I love Kyle,

11:36.196 --> 11:38.797
But you -- you can't let
your high-school boyfriend

11:38.799 --> 11:40.365
Hold you back.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.867
So what am I supposed to do --
stop seeing him?

11:44.704 --> 11:47.305
Honey,
when I joined the kappas,

11:47.307 --> 11:48.973
I had a high-school
boyfriend -- paul.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.375
You remember?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.811
I think you met him that time
we visited marysville.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.413
The guy
with all the skin tags?

11:55.415 --> 11:59.017
Well, he was very attractive
in high school, and sweet.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.386
But I broke it off
with paul

12:01.388 --> 12:03.888
When I joined
the kappa kappa nus.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.325
Well...Honey,
you understand why?

12:07.327 --> 12:08.993
Because of the skin tags.
No.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.995
Honey, no. Uh, no.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.764
His -- his skin
was very different back --

12:12.766 --> 12:14.999
You know what?
Never mind. Okay.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.836
Um, paul and I broke up

12:17.838 --> 12:20.905
Because I wanted
the whole college experience,

12:20.907 --> 12:23.108
Including meeting new
and interesting men --

12:23.110 --> 12:24.709
College men.

12:24.711 --> 12:28.513
If I hadn't, I never would have
married your father.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.950
So I guess that's a vote
for tag face.

12:36.288 --> 12:38.757
Hey, Kyle.
Just the guy I was looking for.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.858
At your service.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.926
Listen. Some kid hurled
up on the rock wall.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.129
You got to hop up there,

12:44.131 --> 12:47.732
Clean off the "lava" before
it rains down on the villagers.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.434
Yes, sir.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.802
Are you
just getting in now?

12:50.804 --> 12:53.772
Oh, yeah. I went to Mandy's
astronomy class.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.141
Did you know that if you took
a rocket to neptune,

12:56.143 --> 12:59.310
You'd die of old age
before you got there?

12:59.312 --> 13:01.913
Well, don't let that stop you
from trying, Kyle.

13:01.915 --> 13:06.084
Uh, Mandy doesn't need you to
drive her to school every day.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.887
Yeah, but I want to be there
for her, mr. B.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.822
College has been
a big adjustment,

13:10.824 --> 13:12.557
And she seems
really tense lately.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.925
Maybe 'cause
she's being followed around

13:13.927 --> 13:15.794
By some weirdo
in a mullet.

13:15.796 --> 13:19.998
She is? Seriously?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.734
With all she has
on her plate.

13:22.736 --> 13:25.170
Listen, Kyle, aren't you
a little embarrassed

13:25.172 --> 13:27.105
Puppy-dogging
after my daughter?

13:27.107 --> 13:28.940
I don't feel that way at all,
mr. B.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.909
It's what I enjoy most
in my life.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.912
May not be good
at a lot of things, but...

13:33.914 --> 13:36.314
I'm really great
at caring about Mandy.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.816
And don't worry.
I'm giving her plenty of space.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.118
I haven't seen her in days.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.353
You saw her in class.

13:42.355 --> 13:46.524
No, uh,
but I took excellent notes.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.294
She's been so busy
with the kappa kappa nus,

13:49.296 --> 13:50.695
And "the kappa kappa
nu's news."

13:50.697 --> 13:53.598
That's their online
newsletter.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.700
She's the nus'
new news editor.

13:57.369 --> 13:59.804
You're a good guy, Kyle.
Listen.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.040
When you clean up the barf,
try not to barf.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.109
Once you get on
that merry-go-round,
it's hard to get off.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.690
[ knock on window ]

14:20.559 --> 14:23.561
Hey. Come in.
Okay, you're gonna love this.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.163
I came up with this poem
to help you remember

14:25.165 --> 14:26.698
The order of the planets
from the sun.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.999
Okay.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.834
Mercury, venus, earth,
and mars,

14:29.836 --> 14:33.104
Jupiter, saturn,
uranus, neptune.

14:36.141 --> 14:37.508
Doesn't rhyme.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.712
It's free verse.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.348
I learned about it taking notes
for you in your english class.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.583
Oh.
Hey, we have to talk.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.985
Okay.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.354
But you need to study this stuff
for the quiz tomorrow,

14:49.356 --> 14:52.190
So I'll talk in the character
of the sun.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.458
[ clears throat ]

14:55.527 --> 14:59.130
[ deep voice ]
oh, I turn hydrogen into helium!

15:02.601 --> 15:04.469
Helium!

15:06.605 --> 15:08.606
Hey, you remember
how professor moore said

15:08.608 --> 15:10.208
That pluto
used to be a planet

15:10.210 --> 15:11.609
And then, a few years ago,

15:11.611 --> 15:14.012
Suddenly it wasn't
a planet anymore?

15:14.014 --> 15:16.381
[ normal voice ] yeah, I know.
Anything can happen.

15:16.383 --> 15:20.618
We're living in the golden age
of astronomy.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.420
Right.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.256
Well, maybe it happened
because the solar system

15:25.258 --> 15:27.258
Just needed to take a break
from pluto.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.394
Like, maybe it still
really loves pluto.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.195
It just needs
some time apart.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.597
What are you saying?

15:32.599 --> 15:35.633
We haven't gotten to metaphors
in your english class yet.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.870
I'm finding it really hard
to balance my time

15:38.872 --> 15:40.705
Between you
and the sorority.

15:46.145 --> 15:48.379
Look, Mandy...

15:48.381 --> 15:51.783
You shouldn't be worried
about the sorority right now.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.217
And you shouldn't worry
about me.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.419
You need to focus
on school.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.554
School
will always be there.
No.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.156
Don't take it
for granted.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.058
Not everybody
gets to go to college,

16:00.060 --> 16:02.393
No matter how much money
your family sets aside

16:02.395 --> 16:04.162
For your education.

16:04.164 --> 16:08.333
Not if you got a grandma with
a bus pass who plays the slots.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.135
Hey.
You turned out great.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.236
[ chuckles ] I know.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.072
A-and I love working
at outdoor man

16:14.074 --> 16:16.307
With my best friend,
mr. Baxter.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.845
But you're destined
for bigger things than I am.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.413
Yeah,
I don't know about that.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.982
I do. Okay?

16:23.984 --> 16:29.787
And I will do anything
to help you do well in school.

16:29.789 --> 16:30.955
Even if that means

16:30.957 --> 16:33.558
You need to take a break
from pluto for a while.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.170
Still?

16:46.172 --> 16:51.275
Mr. Baxter, can I talk to you
in private, sir?

16:51.277 --> 16:55.380
Sure, troy.
Come on in.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.449
Take a seat on the couch.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.886
Or do you prefer
an imaginary chair?

17:01.888 --> 17:03.321
No. No, thank you.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.189
This is, uh, a little --
a little awkward here.
Yeah.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.691
I'm here on behalf
of the loading dock to talk

17:06.693 --> 17:10.661
To management about salary
and working conditions.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.064
It's your company, Ed,
so you're standing there

17:13.066 --> 17:14.866
Demanding more money
from yourself.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.668
Hey, listen, the --
the guys at the loading dock

17:17.670 --> 17:20.872
Were talking about
the -- you know, the --
the beer-company strike,

17:20.874 --> 17:24.909
And, uh, long story short,
I've been elected shop foreman.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.345
[ chuckles ]

17:27.347 --> 17:29.147
With that ponytail,
they put you in charge?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.715
Listen. Listen.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.318
It takes a lot of confidence
to pull off a ponytail.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.355
And I feel such a bond
with these guys.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.723
They were chanting my name.
Right?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.325
Right? "troy! Troy! Troy!
Troy! Troy!"

17:41.327 --> 17:43.194
Which is not your name.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.497
No. Actually,
it's trojillo.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.333
I shortened it when I came
to this country.

17:49.335 --> 17:52.570
See, t-there's a lot of bigotry
against paraguayans.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.705
I'm gonna stop you there, Ed.
This is nuts.

17:54.707 --> 17:58.109
You're right. You're right.
[ clears throat ]

17:58.111 --> 18:01.913
I think troy fontaine has --
has gotten away from me.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.048
Yeah.

18:04.050 --> 18:07.852
Uh, I guess the best plan
is to fire me.

18:07.854 --> 18:12.256
Um, you want me to do it,
or...

18:12.258 --> 18:14.125
Or do you have
a mirror handy?

18:18.430 --> 18:19.864
Okay.

18:19.866 --> 18:23.468
Listen, troy, as much as I hate
to do this, you're fired.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.470
[ groans ]

18:25.472 --> 18:29.307
This blow is really gonna be
a test of troy's sobriety.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.542
You know,
I'm beginning to understand

18:31.544 --> 18:34.112
That bias
against paraguayans.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.481
All right, Mike, look.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.649
This has been a good break
for me, Mike.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.552
Yeah, got away from the stresses
of being the boss. I get it.

18:41.554 --> 18:44.455
I lose myself in the romance
of unloading boxes.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.324
[ chuckles ]

18:46.326 --> 18:49.560
Which wears thin
surprisingly quickly.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.562
All right, I guess
I'll give the guys a raise

18:51.564 --> 18:53.164
And get some help
on the dock.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.266
How about a little help
up here?

18:55.268 --> 18:56.901
No, I have to handle this
all myself.

18:56.903 --> 19:00.371
No, no, no.
I mean up here.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.774
You're not well, Ed.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.810
Listen, look --
don't worry about me.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.812
All right?
Ed will be back tomorrow.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.013
Great.
All right?

19:09.015 --> 19:11.449
And we'll forget
this ever happened.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.416
Okay.
All right?

19:12.418 --> 19:14.585
All right.
We're good.

19:15.954 --> 19:19.023
I'll see you in hell,
fat cat!

19:27.466 --> 19:28.866
Hey, mom, I'm not gonna
be home for dinner.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.468
I've got to get over
to the house.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.436
This is your house, and if you
want to keep living in it,

19:32.438 --> 19:34.438
You got to stop
cutting classes!

19:34.440 --> 19:36.474
You cut class?
I missed astronomy.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.010
It's just been really hard
keeping up with everything.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.279
So you let your classes slide?
There's a good choice.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.282
Honey, honey,
we talked about this.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.550
Yeah, and you were right.
You know?

19:45.552 --> 19:47.151
I had to make a choice
between the kappa nus and Kyle.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.553
Oh, you know, I'm sorry.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.521
Gosh, t-that must not
have been easy.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.523
Uh, no. It was pretty easy.
I chose Kyle.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.592
Hey, nice to see you,
mr. B.!

19:55.561 --> 19:59.063
Mrs. B.

20:04.736 --> 20:07.538
Those are
lovely earrings.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.541
I'm, uh, on my way over
to quit the sorority.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.510
Oh, boy. They already taught you
their secret handshake.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.145
Now they're gonna
have to kill you.

20:15.747 --> 20:17.748
Mandy, honey, come --
you were so excited.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.550
Yeah, it's too bad
she won't be meeting

20:19.552 --> 20:22.587
All those "new,
interesting men."

20:22.589 --> 20:25.756
But don't worry.
I'll try not to "hold her back."

20:25.758 --> 20:27.758
Did you really say that,
Vanessa?

20:29.561 --> 20:31.562
Hey, look -- I've decided
that I don't need the kind

20:31.564 --> 20:34.165
Of heavy social life that I had
in high school, you know?

20:34.167 --> 20:37.368
I'm gonna face college
as an individual like dad did.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.904
All alone,
but with Kyle.

20:40.772 --> 20:43.207
Pretty much the same
as being alone.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.675
And part of that
is I don't need you

20:44.677 --> 20:46.577
To drive me to class
every day, you know?

20:46.579 --> 20:49.180
Maybe I'll be lonely,
but I'll be okay

20:49.182 --> 20:50.715
'cause I know
you'll be waiting for me.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.283
And I'm okay, too.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.353
Except for a searing feeling
of betrayal

20:55.355 --> 20:57.588
From someone I used to think of
as a second mother.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.758
Oh, Kyle! Come on!
I didn't mean to --
[ door slams ]

21:00.760 --> 21:02.994
Honey, honey.
You meant it.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.465
You know, I just want
what's best for her.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.601
And you don't want grandchildren
with webbed feet. I understand.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.770
You know, I worry
about our daughters

21:12.772 --> 21:14.772
A-and the men they choose.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.040
Yeah, I know.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.210
They -- they can't all win
the lottery like you did.

21:19.212 --> 21:20.778
[ chuckles ]

21:20.780 --> 21:21.879
Just remember --

21:21.881 --> 21:23.481
A lot of people
who win the lottery

21:23.483 --> 21:26.217
End up killing themselves.

21:26.219 --> 21:29.020
Huh. And you remember
they usually end up
blowing their winnings.
