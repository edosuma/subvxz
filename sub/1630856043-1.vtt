WEBVTT

00:02.297 --> 00:04.424
<i>Okay, he right back in it
like it's crack</i>

00:04.424 --> 00:05.717
<i>'Cause once you fuck with Reign</i>

00:05.717 --> 00:07.093
<i>You ain't never going back</i>

00:07.093 --> 00:09.262
<i>I tell that sucka put his tongue in it</i>

00:09.262 --> 00:11.931
<i>And be done with it,
put his tongue in it</i>

00:11.931 --> 00:16.019
Shawna, put the flour in the pot.
Like a bad bitch.

00:16.019 --> 00:17.562
<i>You just mad 'cause ya man...</i>

00:17.562 --> 00:19.981
It's supposed to be baking soda,
not flour.

00:19.981 --> 00:22.275
Grab the spoon and stir the pot.

00:25.778 --> 00:27.447
That is not how you cook crack.

00:27.947 --> 00:29.532
Have any of y'all been to a crack house?

00:29.782 --> 00:32.577
Look, the focus is ass crack,
not crack-crack.

00:32.577 --> 00:35.246
If people are looking at the stove,
then we got bigger problems.

00:35.246 --> 00:36.998
We good? Any notes?

00:37.832 --> 00:39.626
- No notes.
- Cool.

00:40.084 --> 00:42.378
Shawna and Mia,
can you get closer to Reina

00:42.378 --> 00:43.880
and stand on both sides of her?

00:43.880 --> 00:45.840
Come on, y'all, let's make a Oreo.

00:46.382 --> 00:47.467
Bitch, you stupid.

00:48.468 --> 00:49.344
Real stupid.

00:50.345 --> 00:51.513
Love that tongue, Reina.

00:51.513 --> 00:54.641
I need more bad bitch, Shawna.
Can you get down low with Reina?

00:54.641 --> 00:56.768
Yeah, drop it low.
Yeah, yeah, you're doing great.

00:56.768 --> 00:58.269
Just a little bit more into it.

00:58.269 --> 01:01.105
Yeah, that's good.
Alright, alright, alright.

01:01.105 --> 01:02.690
Got it. Take five, everyone.

01:03.900 --> 01:04.901
That was amazing.

01:11.157 --> 01:13.326
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:13.326 --> 01:16.120
See, that's why I fuck with you,
because you always thinkin' of me.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.956
Of course. Oreo?

01:32.929 --> 01:34.013
Yo, Shawna, what's up?

01:36.015 --> 01:37.600
So a white woman in a trap house?

01:37.600 --> 01:40.395
- That's like super groundbreaking.
- Thank you. Appreciate that.

01:40.395 --> 01:41.729
Take that shit to a festival or some shit.

01:41.729 --> 01:42.814
- Stop, stop.
- Okay.

01:42.814 --> 01:43.815
We're not doing this shit again.

01:43.815 --> 01:44.941
- Okay.
- Alright.

01:44.941 --> 01:46.317
I'm just saying, maybe

01:47.277 --> 01:49.779
what we're doing is offensive
to the people who cook crack

01:49.779 --> 01:51.364
to support their families.

01:51.906 --> 01:54.075
Right? And it's also kind of stupid.

01:54.492 --> 01:57.078
Offensive to the crack-cooking community?

01:57.078 --> 01:59.038
The crack-cooking-- Like, Jeezy and them.

01:59.414 --> 02:01.124
You know what outrage marketing is?

02:01.583 --> 02:04.544
That's this.
We're doing outrage marketing.

02:04.544 --> 02:06.337
Okay? By any means necessary.

02:07.422 --> 02:10.300
Do not quote Malcolm X right now.
This is the wrong time to bring him up.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.177
What about Martin? "I have a scheme."

02:12.177 --> 02:14.679
<i>I'ma spend his cream</i>

02:14.679 --> 02:16.890
<i>Put his face in that crack like fiends</i>

02:16.890 --> 02:19.184
<i>Put a arch in your back then leave</i>

02:19.184 --> 02:21.227
<i>I'ma show you how to run these schemes</i>

02:21.227 --> 02:23.521
<i>Say my name in it, go insane in it</i>

02:23.521 --> 02:25.773
<i>Say this pussy too wild no tamin' it</i>

02:25.773 --> 02:28.067
<i>Like ha-ha-ha-ha
if he ain't got change</i>

02:28.067 --> 02:30.028
<i>If he do, then I'm straight
to the bank wit' it</i>

02:30.028 --> 02:32.530
<i>I'ma spend his cream</i>

02:32.530 --> 02:34.282
<i>Seduce and scheme...</i>

02:42.332 --> 02:44.000
Think this gonna be ready
before the sun goes down?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.710
If you let me cook.

02:45.710 --> 02:48.463
I'm gonna go outside. I'm hungry,
and I wanna go outside for a little while.

02:48.463 --> 02:50.757
- Adam!
- Come on then, feed me then.

02:51.382 --> 02:52.300
I think it needs more salt.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.259
Yeah.

02:55.678 --> 02:57.430
Smells really good in here.

02:57.430 --> 02:59.807
Hey, look who it is.

02:59.807 --> 03:01.518
We don't have any money, Shawna.

03:01.518 --> 03:03.561
- Hey, Sha'Carri!
- That's why she's here.

03:03.561 --> 03:04.646
That's not why I came.

03:05.563 --> 03:07.148
Stop, stop. Shut the fuck up.

03:07.148 --> 03:10.485
Hi. Hi.
Why are you wearing my OutKast sweatshirt?

03:10.485 --> 03:12.570
- I look better in it.
- Get out of my face.

03:13.238 --> 03:16.199
- What's going on, Shawna?
- Not much.

03:17.575 --> 03:21.871
I just came to tell you guys
that they're doing

03:21.871 --> 03:25.708
an investigation at the Plymouth,
and they're questioning everybody.

03:25.708 --> 03:28.044
It's not a big deal, though,
but they did question me,

03:28.044 --> 03:29.629
and I wanted you guys to know

03:29.629 --> 03:31.840
before you found out about it
in the "Miami New Times."

03:31.840 --> 03:33.258
Find out what?

03:34.551 --> 03:37.387
I don't know. I think fraud.

03:37.387 --> 03:39.264
- Who questioned you?
- <i>Seduce and scheme</i>

03:41.349 --> 03:42.934
The police questioned me.

03:44.894 --> 03:46.604
- Are you involved somehow?
- Damn.

03:46.604 --> 03:48.106
I'm a person of interest.

03:48.106 --> 03:49.566
Shawna, what did you do?

03:49.566 --> 03:50.984
I haven't been charged with anything.

03:50.984 --> 03:53.361
Oh, great. You hear that?
She hasn't been charged.

03:53.361 --> 03:55.405
A college dropout.

03:56.281 --> 04:02.078
A rapping motel clerk. A derelict.
Every decision you have made is stupid.

04:03.663 --> 04:08.251
Things are actually going really well.
I'm gonna go on tour with Lord AK.

04:09.752 --> 04:11.087
- Like the rifle?
- Shut up, Sade!

04:11.838 --> 04:15.675
I won't continue to watch you
make the wrong decisions.

04:15.675 --> 04:18.511
If you go on that tour,
then don't bother coming here again.

04:18.511 --> 04:20.305
- Ruby, listen--
- I mean it, Adam!

04:29.230 --> 04:30.440
What y'all think about this?

04:32.150 --> 04:33.485
It's giving.

04:33.485 --> 04:34.819
Period, poo!

04:34.819 --> 04:35.987
I ain't mad at it.

04:35.987 --> 04:37.697
That is cute.

04:39.115 --> 04:41.034
- What's the budget again?
- Budget?

04:41.034 --> 04:42.368
We don't speak those.

04:43.244 --> 04:46.498
You spoke it just fine a week ago
when you were shopping at Forever 21.

04:46.498 --> 04:50.460
Now you think 30 racks is a lot of money.
I'm telling you, that shit can go fast.

04:50.460 --> 04:51.419
I'm just sayin'.

04:51.419 --> 04:56.257
Well, Miss Know-It-All,
I already paid my rent up for six months.

04:56.257 --> 04:58.092
I paid for my baby tuition.

04:58.092 --> 05:00.970
And guess what, bitch?
I got all the streaming services.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.263
Well, hell, what's your log in?

05:02.263 --> 05:03.515
Because I don't even
remember whose I'm using.

05:03.515 --> 05:04.516
Mine, bitch.

05:04.516 --> 05:06.851
Well, bitch,
why you keep changing the password?

05:06.851 --> 05:09.938
And in the next few days,
we finna open up for Lord AK.

05:09.938 --> 05:12.857
And once he cosign us,
it's gon' open so many doors.

05:12.857 --> 05:14.234
I heard that.

05:14.234 --> 05:16.694
Girl, I can't wait to go
to the Breakfast Club

05:16.694 --> 05:18.446
so I can replace Angela Yee.

05:18.446 --> 05:21.866
Now, how is this gonna work
if Lauryn Steal go to prison?

05:21.866 --> 05:25.078
Fuck her.
She said she weren't going to jail.

05:25.787 --> 05:28.957
Either way, I'ma get this money.

05:28.957 --> 05:30.208
That's all it need to be.

05:30.208 --> 05:31.417
Girl, she going to jail.

05:31.417 --> 05:32.418
You think?

05:33.962 --> 05:34.838
That's the one.

05:34.838 --> 05:36.256
That's it.

05:36.256 --> 05:37.549
That's giving "rich bitch."

05:37.549 --> 05:38.675
- Milky.
- Yeah.

05:38.675 --> 05:40.260
Mom, can I have this?

05:40.260 --> 05:41.469
Let me see.

05:42.762 --> 05:45.640
Girl, who you think you is, Blue Ivy?

05:46.224 --> 05:47.725
Friend, put that back.

05:47.725 --> 05:49.394
Don't even touch it.
Don't touch it too hard.

05:49.394 --> 05:51.146
- Don't do her like that.
- Thank you.

05:52.730 --> 05:54.816
By the way, they changed my work schedule,

05:54.816 --> 05:56.860
so I can only take Melissa
the second week now.

05:58.444 --> 06:01.156
- What you mean?
- I know. I'm sorry.

06:01.156 --> 06:02.782
Can't your mama just take her
for the other two weeks

06:02.782 --> 06:04.159
and then I just go get her when I can?

06:04.159 --> 06:05.910
No, I don't want her over there that long.

06:05.910 --> 06:08.079
She be drinking and yelling,
and I don't want Melissa

06:08.079 --> 06:09.747
to be around that all the time like that.

06:10.665 --> 06:12.917
I mean, I know he not fucking
with you right now,

06:12.917 --> 06:14.752
but she does have a daddy
that's not touring

06:14.752 --> 06:18.506
nowhere but his grandma's kitchen.
So, call that nigga and make friends.

06:20.383 --> 06:21.968
'Cause I'm not keeping nobody's kids.

06:23.970 --> 06:25.680
<i>She don't stop at red lights</i>

06:25.680 --> 06:27.348
<i>Freak bitch, then she give me brandy</i>

06:27.348 --> 06:29.017
<i>Get my hair right</i>

06:29.017 --> 06:31.227
<i>Country nigga, I eat fish and grits</i>

06:31.227 --> 06:32.562
<i>You should tread light...</i>

06:35.690 --> 06:36.816
That shit better than a bitch.

06:36.816 --> 06:40.320
Alright now, thanks for being patient.
My man Freddie.

06:48.119 --> 06:49.329
Got somethin' for me?

06:50.121 --> 06:51.289
My girl.

06:51.748 --> 06:53.291
You all set for tonight?

06:53.291 --> 06:55.168
Yeah. I'ma get ready at the hotel, though.

06:56.419 --> 06:59.923
So, who gon' keep the dust
off these hoes while you gone?

07:00.840 --> 07:03.259
I give Jazmin two days
before she outside ashy.

07:03.801 --> 07:05.803
I'm working on it with Calvin. Why?

07:05.803 --> 07:07.222
'Cause you know Bugs been around.

07:08.431 --> 07:10.141
- Around who?
- He stepped to me.

07:10.141 --> 07:12.685
So he probably been sniffing
around these musty hoes, too.

07:14.562 --> 07:15.814
Snake-ass nigga.

07:16.356 --> 07:20.276
And I know Calvin's your uncle, Chastity,
but all his bitches is worn out.

07:20.276 --> 07:23.363
And all Bugs needs is
a reason to catch you slipping.

07:23.363 --> 07:25.907
One thing I know is,
if you give a pressed nigga

07:25.907 --> 07:28.576
an opportunity to fuck you, he'll take it.

07:29.452 --> 07:30.787
So what this got to do with you?

07:30.787 --> 07:32.789
Let me handle business while you gone.

07:33.373 --> 07:34.874
What the fuck you gon' do
if Bugs run up on you?

07:34.874 --> 07:36.000
- Hey! Hey!
- Hell no.

07:37.085 --> 07:38.962
Heel, hoes!
What the fuck wrong with y'all?

07:41.464 --> 07:43.550
I can't stand these broke, dirty hoes.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.968
You messin' up my money, goddammit!

07:44.968 --> 07:46.010
Drive, please.

07:47.262 --> 07:50.390
<i>But you left my love like summer</i>

07:52.267 --> 07:53.935
<i>Bruised me in the worst way</i>

08:00.358 --> 08:01.442
You straight?

08:02.443 --> 08:03.695
Mia, what you want?

08:03.695 --> 08:05.238
Damn, it's like that?

08:11.995 --> 08:15.456
Okay, So look, with this tour,
it's coming together real fast.

08:15.456 --> 08:18.126
It's gon' be a month.
Nelly said she was gon' help me,

08:18.126 --> 08:20.837
but now she's saying she can't watch her
the whole time.

08:21.546 --> 08:24.883
And you know how my mama is,
so that's why I'm here.

08:25.466 --> 08:27.135
So why you ain't think
to come to me first?

08:27.135 --> 08:28.887
Because I thought you was mad.

08:28.887 --> 08:31.931
You ain't never cared about
my feelings before. Why now?

08:31.931 --> 08:34.642
So that's how you wanna be?
We back here now?

08:34.642 --> 08:35.852
This what you wanted.

08:35.852 --> 08:38.646
No, it's not, and you know that.
I ain't want this.

08:40.356 --> 08:42.859
Look, I don't wanna fight
with nobody else.

08:43.276 --> 08:47.238
I got a chance at some shit,
and I just need you on my side, Lamont.

08:47.238 --> 08:48.698
Please.

08:50.783 --> 08:52.869
Look, I'm on my daughter's side, alright?

08:53.369 --> 08:56.039
If she need me, I'll be there.

08:58.124 --> 08:59.209
Thank you.

09:02.462 --> 09:04.047
<i>Stop playing with 'em, Riot</i>

09:04.047 --> 09:05.965
<i>How can I lose if I'm already chose?</i>

09:05.965 --> 09:08.301
<i>Like, if she feeling hot,
then I make that bitch froze</i>

09:08.301 --> 09:09.427
<i>And I get a bitch tight every time...</i>

09:09.427 --> 09:10.637
Have a seat.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.223
Okay, so I got some really good news
about the tour.

09:13.223 --> 09:17.268
As of right now,
we are almost sold out.

09:18.102 --> 09:22.899
We got 20,000 pre-sale tickets already.

09:22.899 --> 09:25.443
- Shit! Shit.
- Run it up. Yes!

09:25.443 --> 09:28.363
So right now, what we're gonna do
is finish the "Tongue" remix.

09:28.363 --> 09:30.114
Then we're gonna rehearse with Reina.

09:30.114 --> 09:33.535
After that, we're gonna do some press,
and then we'll do the cover art.

09:33.535 --> 09:37.914
Bet. And y'all probably should rehearse,
"Seduce and Scheme" and "Nann Badder."

09:37.914 --> 09:39.874
Don't worry about it,
I'ma set that up. We good.

09:40.416 --> 09:42.502
That is not on the set list.

09:43.837 --> 09:46.130
And we really only got room for "Tongue."

09:47.340 --> 09:50.051
Why? They can't give us 10 minutes?
We have two songs.

09:50.426 --> 09:54.222
It's more complicated than that.
It's not just about the time.

09:54.222 --> 09:57.976
Man, we doing numbers right now.
They gon' bring the fans out.

09:57.976 --> 10:01.229
They gon' perform they ass off.
We gotta have our own set.

10:01.229 --> 10:05.483
And the first song we drop, almost got
a million streams right now on Spotify.

10:05.483 --> 10:06.860
It's 700,000.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.778
- I did the numbers.
- I rounded up. I rounded up.

10:10.905 --> 10:12.157
Realistically,

10:12.157 --> 10:15.618
they do not have a history
of ticket sales in these markets.

10:15.618 --> 10:19.455
They got two songs out, and analytics show
that they really don't have that much

10:19.455 --> 10:21.040
of a fan base outside of Miami.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.627
So all that
and you want me to go and ask for more?

10:24.627 --> 10:26.421
This is already a favor.

10:28.256 --> 10:30.592
Well, every time I get on my timeline,
I see them.

10:30.592 --> 10:31.593
So what that mean?

10:31.593 --> 10:35.054
That means you need to follow more people.
That's what that means.

10:35.054 --> 10:39.475
Look, we go on the tour,
run up the fans, record an EP,

10:39.475 --> 10:44.731
walk into that label,
we will get a million-dollar deal, easy.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.524
- One million?
- Are you serious?

10:47.317 --> 10:48.193
Shit.

10:48.193 --> 10:50.778
I mean, it's really up to y'all.

10:51.529 --> 10:54.741
We already wasted a bunch of time
with this legal shit so...

10:54.741 --> 10:57.911
I could be texting Ice Spice right now--

10:57.911 --> 10:59.329
No, do not text Ice Spice.

10:59.329 --> 11:00.788
How much they getting paid?

11:01.623 --> 11:02.790
Right now, it's an investment.

11:06.628 --> 11:08.129
I need a minute with my artists.

11:08.630 --> 11:10.507
Shawna, what are we doing?

11:14.636 --> 11:17.805
Just one minute. Just one minute.
We're gonna figure this out. Come on.

11:27.732 --> 11:29.067
I think that we should take this deal

11:29.067 --> 11:30.860
because they're about to leave in, like,
a few days.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.237
They're gonna go on tour without us.

11:32.237 --> 11:34.823
What are you talkin' about?
You don't take the first offer.

11:34.823 --> 11:36.199
That's the first rule in business.

11:36.199 --> 11:38.201
First offer? This is our only offer.

11:38.201 --> 11:39.911
Guys, this is how it goes.

11:39.911 --> 11:41.746
Like, you don't just make money
from the beginning.

11:41.746 --> 11:43.498
That's why it's called
being a starving artist.

11:43.498 --> 11:44.999
I ain't finna starve.

11:44.999 --> 11:47.752
Look, at the minimum, y'all should be able
to perform your own songs.

11:47.752 --> 11:51.506
We're gonna get there, but for now,
Francois is giving us a huge opportunity.

11:52.674 --> 11:53.883
So you trust him now?

11:55.885 --> 11:57.762
I-- Yeah, I d-- I do.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.682
Let me manage this, my nigga.

12:00.682 --> 12:02.183
- We can haggle.
- Haggle?

12:02.183 --> 12:03.935
We're not buying nameplate earrings, Chastity.

12:03.935 --> 12:05.478
We're trying to go on tour with Lord AK.

12:05.478 --> 12:07.522
Why do you want to blow that? For what?

12:08.690 --> 12:10.066
Mia, what do you think?

12:10.608 --> 12:11.776
I mean,

12:12.569 --> 12:15.280
he did say it could turn
into a million-dollar deal.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.533
And I mean, I'm down
to play the game for a check, so...

12:18.533 --> 12:22.370
Now is the time to make demands.
I want y'all to get something out of this!

12:23.454 --> 12:26.916
He didn't promise us a set, just like
he not promising us a million dollars.

12:26.916 --> 12:29.752
Okay, you watch too much "Empire,"
and I think we should go.

12:34.090 --> 12:35.592
- A'ight.
- Okay.

12:35.592 --> 12:36.926
It's settled then. Cool.

12:42.223 --> 12:44.225
- We're in.
- Alright.

12:44.225 --> 12:46.936
Let's get to work. We leave in three days.
Let's go.

12:48.354 --> 12:49.898
<i>Ayy, Big Chant got so much stamina</i>

12:49.898 --> 12:51.524
<i>I love fuckin' on camera</i>

12:54.444 --> 12:56.112
<i>I'm smokin' on some shit called Pastry</i>

12:56.112 --> 12:57.614
<i>My bitch look like Angela</i>

12:57.614 --> 12:58.907
<i>Any nigga play with me</i>

12:58.907 --> 13:00.283
<i>I promise I'ma handle him</i>

13:00.283 --> 13:02.118
<i>I ain't ready yet, I'm slippin' on...</i>

13:02.118 --> 13:03.995
Shenellica, baby, let me get another one
of them Pink Panties.

13:03.995 --> 13:05.914
Oh, I got you.
We about to make a toast anyway.

13:06.706 --> 13:07.916
Everybody got a glass?

13:08.625 --> 13:09.959
So you just not gon' speak to Gerard?

13:11.127 --> 13:12.545
For what? That's your man.

13:13.046 --> 13:14.881
Everybody make sure you thank Gerard.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.008
He was the one who provided
all of the rib tips.

13:17.008 --> 13:18.968
I got my whole rib right here.

13:18.968 --> 13:21.387
- He a man of God, y'all.
- Yeah, you bet.

13:24.474 --> 13:26.684
Okay. The alcohol.

13:29.562 --> 13:30.688
- Don't do this.
- Bitch, I love you.

13:30.688 --> 13:32.273
Oh, my God, don't do this.

13:33.191 --> 13:34.734
You gon' make me mess up my makeup.

13:34.734 --> 13:36.569
We've been ridin' forever.

13:37.111 --> 13:39.864
Like, I don't know, last year,
you were just on the pole,

13:39.864 --> 13:41.533
and then now you're on the bus
going state to state!

13:42.909 --> 13:44.577
- Now you look like money.
- Well.

13:44.577 --> 13:45.870
You smell like money,

13:45.870 --> 13:48.248
- and these bitches could never.
- Never.

13:48.623 --> 13:49.874
You was born to do this.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.377
Let everybody else
say something different.

13:52.377 --> 13:53.419
I'll beat they ass.

13:53.419 --> 13:54.754
What you gonna do, friend?

13:54.754 --> 13:56.840
I'd tap it right there like beep, beep...

13:56.840 --> 13:58.591
- Beep, beep, beep.
- You remember that one bitch?

14:01.511 --> 14:02.554
Alright. Come on.

14:02.554 --> 14:06.057
Let a bitch run up if she want to,
'cause I don't play 'bout you.

14:06.057 --> 14:07.517
And that's forever.

14:07.517 --> 14:08.768
- Ever-ever?
- Yes.

14:08.768 --> 14:10.019
I love you, friend!

14:10.019 --> 14:11.938
I love you too!

14:11.938 --> 14:13.565
- Pretty girls only.
- Only!

14:13.565 --> 14:15.733
- Ugly bitches? Never!
- Never. Ever.

14:15.733 --> 14:17.235
- Never-ever. Ever-ever.
- Ever-ever.

14:17.235 --> 14:18.236
Okay.

14:19.070 --> 14:21.739
Well, bestie, you know
we been manifesting this

14:21.739 --> 14:23.324
- since we was kids and--
- Oh, my God.

14:23.324 --> 14:25.160
Alright, I want to say something.

14:25.535 --> 14:26.619
Okay.

14:28.872 --> 14:30.999
Look, Mia, I had to raise you by myself.

14:30.999 --> 14:34.335
And you might think otherwise,
but I did the best I could.

14:34.335 --> 14:35.545
You did that, baby.

14:36.087 --> 14:39.632
I busted my ass to give you what you had.

14:40.341 --> 14:41.968
And now, I might not have been perfect,

14:41.968 --> 14:44.929
but I'm proud of everything
that you turned out to be, you know?

14:45.388 --> 14:48.016
Getting to do all the things,
and go all the places

14:48.016 --> 14:49.726
that I never even thought I could go.

14:49.726 --> 14:51.936
So, you judge me all you want to,

14:53.146 --> 14:54.647
but clearly I didn't do too bad.

14:54.647 --> 14:56.274
You didn't be at that, baby.

14:56.274 --> 14:58.193
- That's a good woman.
- Thank you.

14:58.193 --> 14:59.611
How the hell he know?

15:00.445 --> 15:02.363
What is wrong with her?

15:03.364 --> 15:05.867
She mad 'cause I asked Lamont
to keep Melissa instead of her.

15:05.867 --> 15:07.243
Gerard, let me get another drink.

15:07.243 --> 15:08.661
Thank y'all so much.

15:09.245 --> 15:10.538
I love y'all.

15:11.748 --> 15:14.375
Never have I ever

15:14.834 --> 15:18.505
gotten head from a nigga
on a moving vehicle.

15:20.089 --> 15:23.760
Yep. Put it down. Take a drink.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

15:26.054 --> 15:28.890
Never have I ever
had sex with my boyfriend in the library

15:28.890 --> 15:30.350
when my best friend was standing outside

15:30.350 --> 15:32.060
- and really had to pee...
- Oh, shit.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.436
...and had been keeping watch.

15:33.436 --> 15:34.938
You have resentment,
and you need to get over that.

15:34.938 --> 15:36.022
You need to get over that.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.315
- I'm just--
- Okay.

15:37.315 --> 15:39.067
I'm just trying to get you
to play the game.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.319
You ain't got no fuckin' fingers down.

15:44.447 --> 15:47.909
Damn, you got your dick sucked
in public transit.

15:48.409 --> 15:49.285
Yo.

15:49.285 --> 15:53.414
See, this is the Shawna that I miss.
This is the Shawna that I miss.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.669
Cliff's ass ruined everything.

15:57.669 --> 15:59.128
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

15:59.128 --> 16:00.839
I never liked that nigga, so...

16:00.839 --> 16:02.465
Why you ain't tell me that till right now?

16:02.465 --> 16:05.134
I was-- You were in love!
What was I supposed to say?

16:05.635 --> 16:10.181
It just sucked because before that,
we were so-- we were so tight.

16:10.849 --> 16:12.892
Like, I used to call you
when something good happens,

16:12.892 --> 16:14.310
I'll call you when something bad happens.

16:14.310 --> 16:18.231
Like, there were days where I would be
so fucking depressed and

16:19.732 --> 16:22.569
you would be the thing
that got me out of bed in the morning.

16:22.569 --> 16:26.823
I got it in my head
that Cliff would make me better.

16:26.823 --> 16:29.200
Like, he would make me a better woman
or something. Like, just better.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.368
- What?
- Yeah.

16:30.368 --> 16:32.328
What are you fucking talking about?

16:32.328 --> 16:36.791
You are the prize, Shawna.
I'm so serious. You are.

16:38.293 --> 16:41.588
It's funny because you don't even know

16:42.213 --> 16:43.506
how big you're about to be.

16:45.216 --> 16:49.721
Like, by the end of this tour,
there won't be anything you haven't done.

16:50.555 --> 16:53.641
What you really need is to start doing
what you want to do.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.565
Never have I ever

17:01.274 --> 17:03.735
jumped in a mansion pool.

17:05.195 --> 17:06.070
Let's go.

17:08.865 --> 17:12.660
Alright. Alright. Lay it on me.
Catwalk, catwalk, catwalk.

17:12.660 --> 17:13.620
And...

17:15.205 --> 17:16.080
Body.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.626
Alright. Okay!

17:21.085 --> 17:23.296
Alright, hold up. I'm coming.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

17:23.296 --> 17:24.589
Come on, nigga!

17:33.223 --> 17:34.224
Hey, Lamont.

17:35.225 --> 17:36.267
This for you.

17:37.268 --> 17:38.228
For me?

17:39.938 --> 17:41.898
Throat Coat? You coming here being nasty?

17:41.898 --> 17:44.234
No. It's for the vocal cords, man.

17:44.234 --> 17:45.610
Yeah, I bet.

17:45.610 --> 17:47.862
I don't want your voice to be cracking
when you're on stage.

17:47.862 --> 17:49.405
Where Lissy at?

17:50.907 --> 17:52.742
- What's wrong with her?
- She ain't want me to leave.

17:52.742 --> 17:54.118
She been acting like this all day.

17:58.540 --> 18:00.375
Lissy, get out from under that table.

18:00.834 --> 18:01.709
Girl!

18:01.709 --> 18:03.586
One, two...

18:06.422 --> 18:09.133
Look, I'ma only be gone
for a little while.

18:10.051 --> 18:11.928
Okay? We can get a calendar.

18:12.428 --> 18:14.097
Mark it off every day until I come back.

18:14.097 --> 18:15.932
And we can FaceTime every day.

18:15.932 --> 18:21.187
I don't want to go to Grandma's house.
It smells bad. She don't have no channels.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.814
Well, that's what you got a iPad for.

18:22.814 --> 18:24.732
It doesn't work over there.

18:24.732 --> 18:26.442
But, baby, you can use my hotspot.

18:26.442 --> 18:28.236
It's slow, Daddy!

18:28.236 --> 18:29.404
Who you yelling at?

18:29.404 --> 18:31.072
Why do you have to leave?

18:31.573 --> 18:34.159
Look, I got some exciting stuff going on.

18:34.159 --> 18:37.203
Okay? Can you just be happy
for me tonight, please?

18:40.456 --> 18:41.332
I'll get her.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.169
Now you see how she acting, right?

18:44.586 --> 18:45.879
She don't act like that with me.

18:47.672 --> 18:49.757
- Melissa.
- Robyn, why are you even down here?

18:49.757 --> 18:50.884
You gon' get up from under there
and stop showing out,

18:50.884 --> 18:52.260
or do you want me to get you--

18:54.804 --> 18:56.264
- Come on now! Look what you did!
- Mom!

18:56.264 --> 18:57.849
What? No, look what you did.

18:57.849 --> 18:59.767
- Give me my damn drink back.
- She done.

18:59.767 --> 19:02.103
No more pink thongs. She needs some water.

19:02.103 --> 19:03.396
I don't need no damn water.

19:03.396 --> 19:05.690
- Yes, you do.
- You don't run me.

19:05.690 --> 19:07.025
I was running you last night.

19:07.025 --> 19:09.569
Keep that to yourself.
That ain't for everybody to hear.

19:09.569 --> 19:10.820
That ain't everybody business.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.489
Okay, cover your ears. Come on.

19:12.489 --> 19:14.199
Lamont, take Melissa.

19:14.199 --> 19:15.700
- Nelly, give me the water.
- Okay.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.118
Nelly, don't you bring
that water over here.

19:17.118 --> 19:18.661
- Nelly, the water.
- Don't bring that water over here

19:18.661 --> 19:19.913
- or it's gon' be something.
- Nelly, let me get the water.

19:19.913 --> 19:21.372
Bring the water over here. Watch.

19:21.372 --> 19:23.124
- You gon' be wet.
- Give me the water!

19:23.124 --> 19:24.459
Nelly, give me the water.

19:25.126 --> 19:28.046
That's what I thought. Look, y'all ain't
finna be treating me like this.

19:28.588 --> 19:30.507
- I could be home.
- Okay, so go home.

19:32.133 --> 19:33.760
So that's how you talk to me?

19:35.053 --> 19:36.596
You got a bad attitude, little girl.

19:36.596 --> 19:38.806
Okay, look at you.
You ain't no better example.

19:38.806 --> 19:40.475
- Look at me!
- Yeah, I'm looking.

19:40.475 --> 19:41.809
- You drunk as fuck!
- Look at me. Look at me.

19:41.809 --> 19:42.977
Look at me. The fuck?

19:43.520 --> 19:46.773
Look, I don't know what your problem is.
I don't know what your problem is,

19:46.773 --> 19:49.067
but you not finna keep blaming me for it.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.361
Give me the damn keys. I'm gone.

19:52.070 --> 19:53.321
- Shit.
- Mom.

19:53.321 --> 19:54.489
Come on.

19:54.489 --> 19:55.824
- Mom.
- Give me the keys.

19:56.199 --> 19:58.117
Call you a Uber with your drunk ass.

20:07.544 --> 20:10.296
Okay, so, you ghost me till you hungry?

20:11.798 --> 20:13.258
Whose leftovers am I eating?

20:13.967 --> 20:15.093
I cooked this earlier.

20:15.093 --> 20:16.594
I was gonna have this for dinner tomorrow.

20:17.178 --> 20:18.805
You didn't cook this shit.
