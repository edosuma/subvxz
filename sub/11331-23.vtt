00:02.457 --> 00:03.324
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:03.358 --> 00:04.292
I'm going to ask you for the ring back.

00:06.328 --> 00:08.061
I have a place for them to live.

00:08.096 --> 00:09.263
The two of them?

00:09.298 --> 00:11.332
I've got myself a three family
building in Hell's Kitchen,

00:11.366 --> 00:15.069
which isn't too far away from where
Ben and Amy are going to school.

00:15.103 --> 00:17.905
You're not going to the Philippines
to work at a hotel, what are you up to?

00:17.940 --> 00:19.140
I'm not telling you.

00:19.174 --> 00:22.743
We can always be friends.
I have a boyfriend.

00:23.879 --> 00:25.947
Kathy really likes Ethan,

00:25.981 --> 00:27.815
and he really liked her
until you came along,

00:27.850 --> 00:28.950
so if you don't really care about him,

00:28.984 --> 00:30.518
don't break them up.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.753
They're broken up, all right?

00:32.788 --> 00:35.523
I know she loves me. I know it for a fact.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.725
I hacked her computer. She has an E-diary.

00:37.759 --> 00:39.493
I've been dying to tell someone.

00:39.528 --> 00:41.195
Grace and Amy are going
to break up with you.

00:42.364 --> 00:44.298
Even if things don't work out with Amy,

00:44.333 --> 00:45.433
it's never going to happen between us.

00:47.002 --> 00:49.003
If you don't love me and

00:49.037 --> 00:52.139
you don't wanna marry me and you
want to go off to school on your own,

00:52.174 --> 00:55.776
you should tell me. That's
what Adrian said that you said.

00:55.811 --> 00:58.679
Jack, that's just a ridiculous lie.

00:58.714 --> 01:00.548
Ricky still hasn't said anything?

01:00.582 --> 01:01.916
He hasn't mentioned what
happened with Adrian.

01:01.950 --> 01:04.652
No. Are you sure that
Adrian said something to him?

01:04.686 --> 01:06.587
I mean, maybe she just
ratted you out to Jack.

01:06.622 --> 01:08.789
No. It was both of us. She did us both in.

01:08.824 --> 01:11.425
You would not believe what I've
been doing to try to get out of this!

01:11.460 --> 01:13.527
I have been picking out china patterns.

01:13.562 --> 01:15.296
- Grace...
- I know, I know.

01:15.330 --> 01:17.298
And Jack's never been happier. It's like...

01:17.332 --> 01:19.500
nothing to do with the sex,
although there's been plenty of that,

01:19.534 --> 01:22.370
he just love the commitment.
The commitment! Jack!

01:22.404 --> 01:23.337
So, when are you getting married?

01:23.372 --> 01:26.140
Never. I am never going to marry him,

01:26.174 --> 01:28.976
and the deeper I get myself into this,
the more I feel absolutely certain

01:29.011 --> 01:30.077
that I don't want to get married.

01:30.112 --> 01:31.279
I know what you mean.

01:31.313 --> 01:33.781
I was dying to get married and then...

01:33.815 --> 01:35.116
I just thought it was the right thing to do

01:35.150 --> 01:37.752
and now I'm just going to
do it because I said I would.

01:37.786 --> 01:39.053
So, you're...

01:39.087 --> 01:41.055
Yep. I'm still getting
married, day after I graduate.

01:41.089 --> 01:42.857
- Oh, Amy.
- I know, but...

01:44.559 --> 01:46.594
It probably won't be so bad.

01:46.628 --> 01:47.795
In fact, it might be better.

01:47.829 --> 01:49.463
You know, I'll know John is taken care of

01:49.498 --> 01:52.566
while I can focus on
me and only me for once.

01:52.565 --> 01:55.200
Except on weekends and holidays

01:55.234 --> 01:57.435
and any time I have to travel back here

01:57.470 --> 02:01.940
and after college and the rest of my life.

02:01.974 --> 02:05.977
I know how it sounds. It sounds
like I'm a bad mother, but...

02:06.012 --> 02:08.847
I'm just, like, tired of being a mother

02:08.881 --> 02:11.816
and everything that comes along
with it, including marriage.

02:11.851 --> 02:13.151
I just feel like being selfish.

02:13.185 --> 02:14.853
Me, too. And I'm not even a mother.

02:14.887 --> 02:16.855
We're getting out of high school, Grace.

02:16.889 --> 02:18.857
This is when most students
feel like they're being

02:18.891 --> 02:21.793
set free to go out into the
world and do whatever they want.

02:21.827 --> 02:24.462
- Like Madison and Lauren.
- Yeah.

02:24.497 --> 02:26.431
Yeah. And instead we're getting married,

02:26.465 --> 02:28.633
and my two best friends
are headed off to Berkeley.

02:28.668 --> 02:32.470
Yeah. Well, maybe if Adrian
keeps talking to Ricky...

02:34.340 --> 02:35.273
What's he staring at?

02:36.575 --> 02:38.310
Grace, what is he always staring at?

02:38.344 --> 02:41.112
He's been staring at me
since the first day of school.

02:45.151 --> 02:48.053
Wait. You're not trying to go off to
that school to be with Ben, are you?

02:48.087 --> 02:52.724
Grace, I am trying to stay as
far, far away from Ben as possible.

02:52.758 --> 02:53.858
Because?

02:53.893 --> 02:55.961
Well, because... what would be the point?

02:55.995 --> 02:57.762
You know you're going to run into him.

02:57.797 --> 02:59.698
Worse, we're going to be
living in the same building.

02:59.732 --> 03:01.800
I'm going to run into him 24/7.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.601
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:03.636 --> 03:05.704
Amy, can I talk to you? Privately?

03:05.738 --> 03:07.472
Yeah, no problem. Bye.

03:09.675 --> 03:11.609
Hi. What's... what's going on?

03:11.644 --> 03:13.378
Oh, just wondering...

03:13.412 --> 03:15.080
- About?
- About Ben.

03:15.114 --> 03:16.448
About Ben and why Ben is
always so obsessed with you.

03:20.052 --> 03:22.087
You don't think you've done
anything that Ben could maybe

03:22.121 --> 03:24.856
misinterpret as you being
interested in him, have you?

03:24.890 --> 03:27.125
No! Alice, what is this about?

03:27.159 --> 03:31.029
- Do you have an E-diary?
- Um, what if I do?

03:32.298 --> 03:33.832
Oh, no.

03:37.837 --> 03:43.174
♪ Falling in love is
such an easy thing to do

03:43.209 --> 03:45.910
♪ Birds can do it ♪ We can do it

03:45.945 --> 03:48.213
♪ Let's stop talking ♪ Let's get to it

03:48.247 --> 03:50.558
♪ Let's fall in love

Ben. Ben! Hey, Ben!

03:54.954 --> 03:57.155
Hey, Ben! I want to talk to you!

03:58.758 --> 04:00.325
You read my diary!

04:00.359 --> 04:02.727
I'm going to say something I never
thought I'd say... you want to get off me?

04:02.762 --> 04:04.763
Admit it! You read my diary!

04:04.797 --> 04:06.064
Ben, how did you read my diary?

04:06.098 --> 04:07.799
I hacked your computer.
Didn't Alice tell you?

04:07.833 --> 04:09.768
Because obviously she told you something.

04:14.840 --> 04:18.043
I was flattered that the
password was "wings," though.

04:18.077 --> 04:19.978
We ate a lot of wings together, didn't we?

04:20.012 --> 04:23.848
Ben, it was "wings" because that was
me imagining that I could just fly away.

04:23.883 --> 04:27.719
- And land where?
- Where is none of your business.

04:27.753 --> 04:31.022
So I imagined what life would have been
like if I had never gone to band camp.

04:31.057 --> 04:33.992
If I had never met Ricky,
if I had never had John.

04:34.026 --> 04:36.795
That's all that diary
is, just a big "what if."

04:36.829 --> 04:38.730
What if you still have feelings for me?

04:38.764 --> 04:39.731
What if I don't?

04:49.875 --> 04:51.910
You know, it's against the
law to hack someone's computer.

04:51.944 --> 04:55.713
I know, but I could tell from what I read
that you would never have me arrested.

04:55.748 --> 04:58.917
No, I probably wouldn't,
but I could. It is a crime.

04:58.951 --> 05:01.820
And it's a crime of the
heart to hide your feelings.

05:01.854 --> 05:03.822
Ben, there are no feelings for you.

05:03.856 --> 05:05.824
I do not feel anything towards you,

05:05.858 --> 05:08.093
except maybe little frustration,

05:08.127 --> 05:09.928
because you're so obsessed with me.

05:11.130 --> 05:14.799
Which, yes, like, uh,
makes me, wonder, you know,

05:14.834 --> 05:16.768
what would've happened
if we'd stayed together,

05:16.802 --> 05:19.838
which does not mean I have any
real interest at all in you.

05:19.872 --> 05:22.006
You said, and I quote,

05:22.041 --> 05:24.042
"I was too immature at the
time to understand the choice,

05:24.076 --> 05:26.811
But given the choice again,
I would go with the good guy."

05:26.846 --> 05:29.180
Ben! Ricky is the good guy now.

05:29.215 --> 05:31.883
And, yes, I do want to marry the good guy.

05:31.917 --> 05:35.019
Because he's the father of my
child and he's a wonderful father

05:35.054 --> 05:37.922
and I'm sure that he will
be a wonderful husband.

05:37.957 --> 05:41.159
And you left out the most important
part. You're not in love with him.

05:41.193 --> 05:44.129
I know you're not in love with him and
I know you don't want to get married.

05:48.968 --> 05:50.735
Don't do it Amy!

05:52.838 --> 05:54.139
What is wrong with you?

05:54.173 --> 05:55.940
She loves Ricky and Ricky loves her

05:55.975 --> 05:57.876
and they have a son and
they're getting married.

05:57.910 --> 05:59.878
Why would you want to destroy
the lives of three people?

05:59.912 --> 06:03.748
Good question. Excellent question even.

06:03.782 --> 06:06.117
I'm not trying to destroy
the lives of three people,

06:06.152 --> 06:08.119
I'm trying to save the
lives of three people.

06:08.154 --> 06:10.955
Because no matter how much
those three love each other,

06:10.990 --> 06:12.790
Amy does not want to marry Ricky,

06:12.825 --> 06:14.125
and I'm sure Ricky doesn't
want to be married to someone

06:14.160 --> 06:16.027
that doesn't want to marry him.

06:16.061 --> 06:19.764
And as far as getting married for
the children, well, that doesn't work.

06:19.798 --> 06:21.065
Children know when
their parents are unhappy

06:21.100 --> 06:23.067
and they know when they
don't love each other.

06:23.102 --> 06:24.969
Really, Ethan, listen to me.

06:25.004 --> 06:27.005
When a guy gets a girl
pregnant in high school,

06:27.039 --> 06:29.641
even if he does the right thing
and steps up and marries her,

06:29.675 --> 06:31.676
that doesn't mean that the
two of them love each other,

06:31.710 --> 06:33.845
it just means they're two good people
who're trying do the right thing.

06:33.879 --> 06:35.880
But what's the right thing?

06:35.915 --> 06:39.384
To be obligated to someone for the
rest of your life because of one night?

06:39.418 --> 06:42.520
Or is the right thing to have the courage
to realize that, despite that one night,

06:42.555 --> 06:44.656
you still have to live your
dreams or else you'll be miserable?

06:51.297 --> 06:53.097
He knows I'm trying to sleep with Layla?

06:53.132 --> 06:55.233
Hey, Ethan.

06:55.267 --> 06:57.168
You look like you could use a friend.

06:57.203 --> 07:00.205
I'm fine without friends. You're
not my friend, you're Kathy's friend.

07:00.239 --> 07:01.839
Or is it "boyfriend" now?

07:01.874 --> 07:05.643
Uh... we're just friends.

07:05.678 --> 07:08.746
And as Kathy's friend, I
have to tell you something.

07:08.781 --> 07:09.881
Layla is not a nice girl.

07:09.915 --> 07:11.583
I'm not looking for a nice girl.

07:11.617 --> 07:12.817
You're looking for a nice
girl to fool around with.

07:12.851 --> 07:14.719
No. That would be the ideal.

07:14.813 --> 07:16.781
I don't have to have the
ideal. I've never had the ideal.

07:16.815 --> 07:18.750
I'll just take what I can get.

07:18.784 --> 07:20.652
And by the way, I like Layla.

07:20.686 --> 07:24.455
Well, you're not going to like her after
I tell you what she said about Kathy.

07:24.490 --> 07:27.458
She said that Kathy's a skank and
has no idea who got her pregnant

07:27.493 --> 07:29.160
because she's slept with so many guys.

07:29.194 --> 07:31.129
What? She wouldn't say
that. You're making that up.

07:31.163 --> 07:33.364
No, I'm not making that
up. Ask her yourself.

07:33.399 --> 07:37.201
Kathy a skank? That's ridiculous.

07:37.236 --> 07:40.171
She's the nicest, sweetest girl
ever. That's why I broke up with her.

07:40.205 --> 07:42.874
So you would rather
have a gossip and a liar

07:42.908 --> 07:45.743
than the nicest, sweetest girl ever...

07:45.778 --> 07:47.178
or whatever you said?

07:47.212 --> 07:49.847
I cannot wait four years until I
get out of high school to have sex,

07:49.882 --> 07:52.550
- I can't. I don't want to.
- You know who else said that?

07:52.584 --> 07:55.520
Ben Boykewich. Right before
he got that girl pregnant,

07:55.554 --> 07:57.722
the "not Amy girl" that
he wasn't in love with.

07:57.756 --> 07:59.290
How do you know?

07:59.325 --> 08:01.326
Everyone knows. It's legend.

08:06.332 --> 08:09.133
And you never even asked
Amy about what Adrian said?

08:09.168 --> 08:11.402
Why would I? Amy can tell me if
she doesn't want to get married.

08:11.437 --> 08:13.104
Adrian's just causing trouble.

08:13.138 --> 08:15.206
Not with me. Man, I never had it so good.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.875
I love the idea of getting married.

08:19.078 --> 08:20.878
Hey, you want to be my best man?

08:20.913 --> 08:23.081
I'm happy for you Jack, but no.

08:23.115 --> 08:25.149
I don't want to be your
best man. I don't "best man."

08:25.184 --> 08:26.784
Hey.

08:26.819 --> 08:28.920
I just got finished with my last final.

08:28.954 --> 08:29.987
Maybe we can all go out and celebrate.

08:31.990 --> 08:35.592
Okay. I guess no good deed goes unpunished.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.498
I was just trying to help.

08:40.532 --> 08:42.299
Neither of those two can
tell you two the truth,

08:42.333 --> 08:44.502
but go ahead, get married.

08:44.536 --> 08:46.504
Live a lie, if that's what you want.

08:46.538 --> 08:47.472
What do I care?

08:58.241 --> 09:01.276
Hey, you're looking very
handsome. Where are you off to?

09:01.310 --> 09:04.112
I'm going to try to talk Grace into
going to Geoff's for dinner tonight.

09:04.147 --> 09:06.214
George offered to pick up the tab, so...

09:06.249 --> 09:11.653
Perfect. You can give Grace this little
graduation gift that we got for her.

09:11.688 --> 09:13.789
- Really? You got her something?
- Your dad and I.

09:13.823 --> 09:16.625
Dad doesn't shop. This is really nice, Mom.

09:16.659 --> 09:18.827
And I know you really don't
like Grace all that much.

09:18.861 --> 09:21.596
Well, I do, I do, Jack.

09:21.631 --> 09:24.766
And I guess she's going to be
my daughter-in-law someday, so...

09:24.801 --> 09:26.668
I want us to be close.

09:26.703 --> 09:29.304
After all, I don't have a daughter,
so Grace will be my daughter.

09:31.574 --> 09:35.243
So, I have a little confession to make.

09:35.278 --> 09:37.145
What's that?

09:37.180 --> 09:39.214
About a month ago, I went to see Grace.

09:39.248 --> 09:40.315
Did she ever mention that to you?

09:40.349 --> 09:41.316
No.

09:41.350 --> 09:44.786
I probably shouldn't have,

09:44.821 --> 09:47.989
but I thought she was
about to break up with you

09:48.024 --> 09:49.825
and I...

09:49.859 --> 09:53.929
I just told her that I hoped
she wasn't going to do that,

09:53.963 --> 09:57.466
because, you know, well...

09:57.500 --> 09:58.867
you've just been through so much, honey,

09:58.901 --> 10:00.569
and I didn't want to see you hurt.

10:00.603 --> 10:03.705
That was really nice, Mom, to
try to protect me like that,

10:03.740 --> 10:06.274
but Grace loves me, and I love her,

10:06.309 --> 10:07.542
and I don't think we'll ever break up.

10:07.577 --> 10:09.277
No. You probably won't.

10:10.513 --> 10:14.316
Oh! We also got Madison a little something.

10:14.350 --> 10:16.351
Madison?

10:16.385 --> 10:18.954
Yeah, she's graduating, too, and
you two were on and off for years.

10:18.988 --> 10:20.322
We always liked Madison,

10:20.356 --> 10:23.024
so I just wanted to get her a
little something for graduation.

10:23.059 --> 10:25.727
I don't know, Mom. I'm not
sure Grace would approve.

10:25.762 --> 10:28.163
Oh, well, just have Grace give
it to her at school or something,

10:28.197 --> 10:29.698
it's not a big deal.

10:29.732 --> 10:31.867
Okay. Uh, what is it?

10:31.901 --> 10:32.968
Just a charm bracelet.

10:33.002 --> 10:33.969
What'd you get Grace?

10:34.003 --> 10:36.538
Besides my only begotten son?

10:37.473 --> 10:39.407
A watch.

10:39.442 --> 10:44.546
Because me is ticking and you
two will be married one day.

10:44.580 --> 10:48.216
So how much time you figure
you've got left as a single guy?

10:48.251 --> 10:50.452
I don't know, but I
can't wait to get married.

10:54.157 --> 10:55.090
Coming!

11:02.231 --> 11:04.065
You can give me back my key right now.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.834
I'm going to give you back
your key, don't worry about it.

11:10.606 --> 11:11.673
I packed your stuff for you.

11:11.707 --> 11:13.575
- So you said.
- You don't have to get nasty.

11:13.609 --> 11:14.543
I'm not.

11:14.911 --> 11:15.844
Should I get my things?

11:16.712 --> 11:18.480
I'll get them for you.

11:26.522 --> 11:27.522
Here you go.

11:27.557 --> 11:29.324
Those are my things?

11:29.358 --> 11:31.159
My suits?

11:31.194 --> 11:32.427
My suits are wadded up in those bags?

11:32.461 --> 11:34.196
- You could have taken them with you.
- No, I couldn't have,

11:34.230 --> 11:35.297
I was leaving for the airport.

11:36.399 --> 11:39.267
And you know what?

11:39.302 --> 11:41.770
If there was any question in
my mind about whether or not

11:41.804 --> 11:43.738
I should have broken up with you,
there's no question in my mind now.

11:43.773 --> 11:45.774
Oh, you're going to be sorry you
broke up with me, mark my words.

11:45.808 --> 11:47.042
- Goodbye, Adrian.
- Goodbye.

11:50.580 --> 11:52.714
I'm sorry to see it end this way, but...

11:53.883 --> 11:56.418
I guess with you,

11:56.452 --> 11:57.452
this is the way it has to be.

12:00.223 --> 12:01.590
- I wish you all the best.
- Yeah, sure you do.

12:03.326 --> 12:05.260
Bye. Take care.

12:26.816 --> 12:27.949
Anything is possible in the Army.

12:27.984 --> 12:30.886
Yeah, you could get killed.
That's a possibility.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.654
Can you do anything to get out of it?

12:32.688 --> 12:33.855
I don't want to get out of it,

12:33.890 --> 12:35.490
I thought about this all year.

12:35.524 --> 12:36.758
I joined months ago.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.460
My parents are really proud of me.

12:38.494 --> 12:39.527
I'm proud of me.

12:39.562 --> 12:42.497
Henry, I don't know what to say...

12:42.531 --> 12:44.499
did you do this just
to get away from Alice?

12:46.235 --> 12:48.036
Alice, don't let him do this.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.872
Too late. I love you, Henry,
and I would go with you but...

12:50.907 --> 12:54.142
this country put my people in
internment camps during World War II

12:54.176 --> 12:57.078
and took away all their
money and land so...

12:57.113 --> 12:58.847
my parents would never go along.

12:58.881 --> 13:01.850
America is not without flaws, but...

13:01.884 --> 13:03.485
I want to be the best I can be,

13:03.519 --> 13:05.754
so America can be the best that she can be.

13:05.788 --> 13:08.323
And, on behalf of the Armed Forces,

13:08.357 --> 13:09.724
I apologize to your family.

13:09.759 --> 13:12.193
- It was an overreaction.
- You think?

13:12.561 --> 13:13.528
Dad!

13:13.562 --> 13:15.430
You're very brave, Henry.

13:15.464 --> 13:17.332
- Thank you, Alice.
- And stupid.

13:17.366 --> 13:20.101
But if you want, we could sleep
together the last night you're here.

13:20.136 --> 13:22.003
Thanks, Alice, but I'll be fine.

13:22.038 --> 13:25.006
This isn't like a video game. It's
the real Army, you can get killed.

13:25.041 --> 13:26.808
There's no next level.

13:26.842 --> 13:30.779
Well... good for you. Congratulations.

13:30.813 --> 13:32.113
Dad, I didn't call you up
here to congratulate him.

13:32.148 --> 13:33.715
Talk to him, get him out of it.

13:33.749 --> 13:35.016
I'm really proud of you.

13:35.051 --> 13:37.519
It takes a lot of courage
to serve our country,

13:37.553 --> 13:39.754
and it's a selfless act
to defend our freedom,

13:39.789 --> 13:42.590
especially when you've got
nincompoops like Ben here,

13:42.625 --> 13:46.328
who have no idea of the sacrifice
you are about to undertake.

13:46.362 --> 13:47.395
Are your parents on board with this?

13:47.430 --> 13:49.331
Yes, sir, Mr. Boykewich, sir.

13:49.365 --> 13:52.133
They understand that I want to be
part of something bigger than myself.

13:52.168 --> 13:54.002
Like heaven? If there is one.

13:54.036 --> 13:55.303
Shut up and show some respect.

13:55.338 --> 13:57.005
Dad, he could get killed!

13:57.039 --> 13:59.007
Ben... yeah, I could,

13:59.041 --> 14:00.942
I could get killed.

14:00.977 --> 14:03.878
But what if no one was willing to
take that risk to defend our country,

14:03.913 --> 14:04.946
where would we be?

14:04.981 --> 14:06.848
Alive. Overpopulated even.

14:06.882 --> 14:07.916
Ben.

14:07.950 --> 14:09.851
This is ridiculous. Henry...

14:09.885 --> 14:13.621
what happened to going to the Philippines
and working at that swanky hotel?

14:13.656 --> 14:17.425
You knew he was lying,
and I should have known.

14:17.460 --> 14:18.727
There'll be a job waiting
for you when you get out.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.198
Yeah, if you're not dead.

14:23.232 --> 14:25.300
Everyone's going to die Ben, question is...

14:25.334 --> 14:27.502
what kind of life are we going
to live, huh? Think about it.

14:30.306 --> 14:31.906
I'll see you after graduation?

14:31.941 --> 14:32.974
He reports the next day.

14:34.977 --> 14:37.078
You're a good man, Henry. Stay in touch.

14:41.784 --> 14:43.651
Unbelievable.

14:45.788 --> 14:48.490
It's Adrian. I wonder what Adrian wants.

14:48.524 --> 14:49.691
What has Adrian always wanted?

14:49.725 --> 14:51.359
I don't know. Ricky?

14:51.394 --> 14:53.495
That would be my guess, so don't
get caught up in any schemes.

14:53.529 --> 14:55.530
Depends on whether it
involves sleeping with Amy.

14:55.564 --> 14:58.600
- Hello?
- You could die, too. From that.

15:04.273 --> 15:06.141
This is really fun, that you dropped by.

15:06.175 --> 15:08.243
Yeah, I was on my way
over to Grace's house,

15:08.277 --> 15:10.845
but my mom asked me to
drop this gift off to you.

15:12.148 --> 15:13.982
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:14.016 --> 15:17.852
I always loved Didi. She's so
beautiful and such a nice woman.

15:17.887 --> 15:18.853
Yeah, she likes you, too.

15:29.270 --> 15:29.955
Here's what I'm thinking.

15:30.856 --> 15:32.201
You jumped into that engagement.

15:32.202 --> 15:34.953
Before you jump right
back out, think about it.

15:34.988 --> 15:37.589
You and Jack have been on
and off for years, so...

15:37.624 --> 15:38.657
there's got to be something there,

15:38.691 --> 15:39.792
even if you don't want
to get married right now.

15:39.826 --> 15:42.261
I guess that's true,

15:42.295 --> 15:43.629
I just don't want to get married right now.

15:43.663 --> 15:45.531
Well, then don't. Take your time.

15:45.565 --> 15:47.499
Go to whatever school you
want to go to, in state or out.

15:47.534 --> 15:50.135
If he follows, he follows,
if he doesn't, he doesn't.

15:50.170 --> 15:51.403
You do what you want to do
and then I have a feeling,

15:51.438 --> 15:52.438
you're not going to feel so pressured.

15:53.473 --> 15:55.340
Jack's a nice guy,

15:55.375 --> 15:57.976
I hate to see you lose him because
you've worked yourself into a frenzy here.

15:58.011 --> 15:59.845
You don't have to end the relationship,

15:59.879 --> 16:01.847
just put everything in neutral.

16:01.881 --> 16:04.783
If you really didn't want to be with him,
you'd have an easier time telling him.

16:04.818 --> 16:06.785
I don't know about that.

16:06.820 --> 16:10.622
I just feel so guilty not wanting
him when he wants me so much.

16:10.657 --> 16:13.759
Look, in a relationship, one person is
always going to love the other person more.

16:13.793 --> 16:15.928
Which person you want to
be, huh? Think about it.

16:15.962 --> 16:18.730
The one who gets loved the
most is not a bad place to be.

16:18.765 --> 16:20.365
Just ask your mom.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.700
- Hey, Grace.
- Hi, Jack.

16:21.734 --> 16:22.801
Hey, thanks for the free dinner.

16:22.836 --> 16:26.371
Any time. Well, not any
time. Once in a while.

16:26.406 --> 16:27.439
The hostess has got a booth for you.

16:27.474 --> 16:28.640
Okay.

16:28.675 --> 16:30.476
- I'll see you at home.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:37.116 --> 16:39.318
- Hey, Ben.
- Yeah. Hi, Ben.

16:42.055 --> 16:44.156
I'll be back in a moment to
seat you. Right this way, please.

16:49.028 --> 16:51.830
- What's going on?
- Oh, those two idiots!

16:51.865 --> 16:53.632
They don't want to be together,

16:53.666 --> 16:54.900
but they just can't tell each other
they don't want to be together.

16:54.934 --> 16:56.001
Same with Amy and Ricky.

16:56.035 --> 16:58.003
I don't know what you know,
but I can't wait to hear.

16:58.087 --> 16:59.988
We're not going to spend the
night talking about Amy and Ricky,

17:00.023 --> 17:02.891
I don't care about Amy and
Ricky, I just wanted to get out.

17:02.926 --> 17:05.493
- Thanks.
- Oh, please, you just wanted to get out, too.

17:05.528 --> 17:08.730
No, it's good to see you, and
I care about you, as a friend.

17:08.765 --> 17:11.300
And I hope we're always
going to be friends.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.701
I even hope you're going
to end up with Ricky.

17:12.734 --> 17:15.304
I don't have to end up with Ricky
to have Ricky out of your way.

17:16.372 --> 17:17.472
Ricky's going to end up with Clementine.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.946
- Where's Kathy?
- Her grandmother's dropping her off.

17:24.981 --> 17:26.048
She's not here yet?

17:26.082 --> 17:27.348
No. And she has to be
here before we take off.

17:29.018 --> 17:30.953
Like I can't read John a story on my own?

17:30.987 --> 17:34.122
Like you can't be trusted with
our apartment and son alone.

17:34.157 --> 17:36.592
Hey, Ethan. Where's Kathy?

17:36.626 --> 17:38.827
Oh, she'll be here. Her
grandmother is dropping her off.

17:38.861 --> 17:39.962
Hmm.

17:39.996 --> 17:41.763
I don't want you guys to
be late, you should go.

17:41.798 --> 17:44.666
Oh, no, it's my dad's restaurant.

17:44.701 --> 17:47.536
There is no late, we can't be
late. We can eat there, any time.

17:47.570 --> 17:51.373
Oh. Yeah, all right. But, uh,
if you want, you can go now.

17:51.407 --> 17:52.641
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

17:52.675 --> 17:55.277
When I heard that you and Kathy broke up,

17:55.311 --> 17:57.245
I was surprised you two
would babysit together.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.381
Amy, I think I hear John.

17:59.415 --> 18:01.149
- I didn't hear anything.
- Could you check?

18:01.184 --> 18:02.250
Why can't you check?

18:02.285 --> 18:04.319
- I could check.
- I want to talk to you.

18:04.354 --> 18:08.223
Oh, all right. Well,
please hurry, I'm hungry.

18:08.257 --> 18:10.058
He'll be fine here until Kathy comes.

18:10.093 --> 18:12.127
He'll be fine here if Kathy doesn't come.

18:13.029 --> 18:14.229
Thank you, Amy.

18:15.965 --> 18:17.099
I'm glad someone trusts me.

18:17.133 --> 18:18.133
She's not coming, is she?

18:18.167 --> 18:19.668
Who?

18:19.702 --> 18:20.902
Is that girl coming over
here, the other girl,

18:20.937 --> 18:23.505
the girl you're trying
to have sex with, hmm?

18:23.539 --> 18:25.807
Are you planning to use our apartment
to have sex for the first time

18:25.842 --> 18:27.743
- with my son in the next room?
- No.

18:27.777 --> 18:30.379
Wait! What? What are you planning to do?

18:30.413 --> 18:31.780
Nothing.

18:35.585 --> 18:37.219
Hi, Ricky.

18:37.253 --> 18:38.253
Who's that?

18:38.287 --> 18:40.122
I'm Layla. I'm going to help Ethan babysit.

18:40.156 --> 18:41.990
No, you're not.

18:42.025 --> 18:44.993
Okay, he can do all the babysitting,
I don't care. But I do have experience.

18:45.028 --> 18:46.294
That's what I've heard.
You have to go home.

18:46.329 --> 18:48.296
My mom already left. Can you take me home?

18:50.033 --> 18:51.867
- We'll drop her off.
- Ethan?

18:51.901 --> 18:52.968
Ricky, we're not going to do anything.

18:53.002 --> 18:54.870
Just let her come in and you two take off.

18:54.904 --> 18:56.738
Um, I don't know about that.

18:56.773 --> 18:58.640
Hey, no offense, Layla,
but I don't know you

18:58.675 --> 19:00.809
so I wouldn't really be
comfortable with your staying here.

19:00.843 --> 19:01.877
We don't have to get out tonight

19:01.911 --> 19:03.845
This is ridiculous.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.615
We can babysit, the two of us. We
will be fine, John will be fine.

19:06.649 --> 19:08.417
He doesn't know her, he knows Kathy.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.619
So, no, Ethan, I'm sorry. No!

19:10.653 --> 19:11.653
I'm vouching for her.

19:11.688 --> 19:14.256
You just lied to us, so, no.

19:14.290 --> 19:16.525
I'll take both of you home.
I'll pick up dinner to go, Amy.

19:17.627 --> 19:19.428
- I trusted you.
- Me, too.

19:19.462 --> 19:20.395
Let's go.

19:35.078 --> 19:36.211
- Hi, Amy.
- Hi. How are you?

19:36.245 --> 19:37.212
Oh, I'm okay.

19:37.246 --> 19:38.814
Are you?

19:38.848 --> 19:40.982
I heard you and Ethan broke up.

19:41.017 --> 19:42.951
I haven't had time to
catch up with you at school.

19:42.985 --> 19:44.820
I've got graduation coming up and...

19:44.854 --> 19:45.854
And your wedding.

19:45.888 --> 19:46.822
That, too.

19:47.724 --> 19:48.957
Yeah.

19:48.991 --> 19:50.525
So, uh, you and Ethan?

19:50.560 --> 19:52.527
No, it didn't work out.

19:52.562 --> 19:56.465
I know that hurts, but give yourself
the summer to get past it and next fall,

19:56.499 --> 19:58.600
you just make a fresh
start. Focus on school...

19:58.634 --> 20:00.469
I'm going to go home
to Houston this summer.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.205
Well, that's a good idea. Spend
some time with your parents.

20:03.239 --> 20:04.339
I know they must miss you.

20:04.373 --> 20:05.540
I'm not coming back in the fall.

20:05.575 --> 20:07.109
Really?

20:07.143 --> 20:08.477
I hope that's not because of Ethan.

20:08.511 --> 20:12.080
It's because of Ethan. And that
stupid girl he's trying to hump.

20:13.916 --> 20:16.051
Sorry. I'm really angry about it.

20:16.085 --> 20:19.955
This girl told Ethan that I have no
idea of who the father of my baby was

20:19.989 --> 20:21.022
because I'm a skank.

20:21.057 --> 20:22.858
That's terrible!

20:22.892 --> 20:24.793
Oh, my gosh, but Kathy,

20:24.827 --> 20:26.762
you can't let Ethan and some girl stop you

20:26.796 --> 20:28.930
from living with your grandmother
and going to school here.

20:28.965 --> 20:31.600
I mean, if you want to go home to
your parents, then good for you,

20:31.634 --> 20:33.602
but if you don't, don't
let those two stop you.

20:33.636 --> 20:39.207
I don't care. People at home thought I
was a skank and now people here think I am.

20:39.242 --> 20:40.575
I've got no place to hide,

20:40.610 --> 20:42.210
not that I was hiding.

20:42.245 --> 20:45.547
I mean, I wasn't exactly
able to hide, but...

20:45.581 --> 20:50.018
I thought that if people got to know
me here, they'd know I was a nice girl

20:50.052 --> 20:51.386
and it wouldn't matter
if I had a baby, but...

20:53.089 --> 20:54.956
apparently people don't
think I'm a nice girl.

20:54.991 --> 20:57.025
Okay, you have to stop worrying
about being a nice girl,

20:57.059 --> 20:58.994
you are a nice girl.

20:59.028 --> 21:02.864
And you do what you want to do and forget
what other people are saying or doing.

21:02.899 --> 21:04.966
I'm not going to forget
that Ethan broke up with me

21:05.001 --> 21:08.570
just so he could have sex with that girl
who started a vicious rumor about me.

21:09.672 --> 21:10.605
What?

21:10.873 --> 21:11.907
Nothing.

21:11.941 --> 21:14.676
I'm really sorry Kathy, but, I, uh...

21:14.710 --> 21:16.812
I don't think Ethan's gonna
be having sex with anyone.

21:16.846 --> 21:19.447
That's the only thing
he's interested in, is sex.

21:19.482 --> 21:22.250
Yeah, well, he's an idiot. I'll
talk to you at school, okay?

21:22.285 --> 21:23.318
All right.

21:36.265 --> 21:37.232
Hello?

21:37.266 --> 21:39.835
Oh, Mr. Boykewich.

21:39.869 --> 21:41.136
I'm sorry, I was calling Chloe.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.138
She left her phone. She
had something to do tonight.

21:43.172 --> 21:45.140
- Okay, well...
- I'll tell her you called.

22:02.117 --> 22:03.551
What is wrong with you?

22:03.585 --> 22:06.187
Same thing that's wrong with every
teenage guy I know, including you.

22:06.221 --> 22:07.888
You were going to have
sex with her, weren't you?

22:07.923 --> 22:09.924
While you were babysitting John.

22:09.958 --> 22:13.694
Is it not enough to have a baby that
was conceived by two high school students

22:13.729 --> 22:16.564
ten feet away from you to
remind you that sex makes babies?

22:16.598 --> 22:17.932
- Do you not get that?
- We have condoms.

22:17.966 --> 22:20.434
You did not have condoms.

22:20.469 --> 22:21.802
If you did, you didn't know how to use one.

22:21.837 --> 22:25.706
God, you are so lucky I
got my temper under control.

22:25.741 --> 22:27.642
I knew how to use a
condom, I just didn't, okay?

22:27.676 --> 22:31.379
And that could be you. You may
have condoms, you may not use them,

22:31.413 --> 22:35.283
or you may use them badly, or the condom
might break or a million other things.

22:35.317 --> 22:37.351
Like what? What million other things?

22:37.386 --> 22:39.153
I don't know, okay, but things!

22:39.187 --> 22:41.355
You're not even making sense.
Everyone has sex in high school.

22:41.390 --> 22:43.257
No, they don't! Half of them don't!

22:43.292 --> 22:46.193
And at least some of the other half,
who say they are having sex, lie!

22:46.228 --> 22:47.895
I don't want to be in that half.

22:47.929 --> 22:50.798
I don't want to lie. I want to have sex.

22:50.832 --> 22:54.602
Look, I'm sorry I lied to you and
said Kathy was coming over, but...

22:54.636 --> 22:56.837
- I had no other place to have sex.
- Right there!

22:56.872 --> 22:59.907
Right there is one reason, you
are too young to be doing this!

22:59.941 --> 23:02.543
You don't even have a place to have sex!

23:02.577 --> 23:04.512
Mom isn't going to let you
have sex in your room at home,

23:04.546 --> 23:06.647
and her mom isn't going to let
you have sex at her house, so...

23:06.682 --> 23:08.349
where are you going to have sex?

23:08.383 --> 23:09.517
Like I said,

23:09.551 --> 23:11.152
we were hoping to do it at your apartment.

23:11.186 --> 23:13.521
Our apartment is off
limits to you. Permanently.

23:13.555 --> 23:15.256
Or until you need a babysitter again.

23:25.067 --> 23:27.068
You're not going to tell Margaret
and Shakur about this, are you?

23:27.102 --> 23:28.669
No, I'm not.

23:28.704 --> 23:30.771
Okay, thanks.

23:30.806 --> 23:33.607
On the condition that you just wait.

23:33.642 --> 23:36.877
At least wait until you can drive and
you have a safe, private place to go

23:36.912 --> 23:38.779
and you're out of high school.

23:38.814 --> 23:42.416
I am not going to promise you that I
am not going to have sex in high school.

23:42.451 --> 23:45.519
You can tell Margaret and Shakur
because I'm not making that promise.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.254
I am not going to waste
my high school years.

23:47.289 --> 23:50.057
This should be when sex is the
most fun, when it means nothing!

23:50.092 --> 23:54.095
You may not want it to mean anything,
but Ethan, it will mean something to you

23:54.129 --> 23:55.930
and if not to you, to her.

23:55.964 --> 23:57.064
It will mean something to one of you

23:57.099 --> 23:59.900
and that's where it gets all messed up.

23:59.935 --> 24:04.038
It's the most intimate thing that two
people can do with each other, all right?

24:04.072 --> 24:08.609
And one day, you are going to meet
that girl that you fall in love with

24:08.643 --> 24:11.379
and you're going to get in bed
with her and she's going to ask you

24:11.413 --> 24:13.414
how many girls you've slept with.

24:13.448 --> 24:14.682
What do you want your answer to be?

24:14.716 --> 24:17.651
I don't know. Like, 100?

24:17.686 --> 24:19.553
You think any girl out there
is going to want to be with you

24:19.588 --> 24:21.322
if you've been with 100 girls!

24:21.356 --> 24:22.456
Is that the problem with Amy?

24:23.558 --> 24:25.226
Is that why she doesn't want to marry you?

24:25.260 --> 24:26.327
Because you slept with 100 girls?

24:30.165 --> 24:32.266
You want to know the truth?

24:32.300 --> 24:36.170
When I have sex with Amy, I
don't really feel anything.

24:36.204 --> 24:37.671
You know why, Ethan?

24:38.874 --> 24:40.574
Because I slept with too many girls.

24:42.644 --> 24:45.513
And now, even though I love Amy
more than any of those girls,

24:45.547 --> 24:46.847
even though she means everything to me,

24:48.717 --> 24:51.519
the sex is nice, but...

24:51.553 --> 24:55.589
I don't feel passionate,
I feel comfortable.

24:55.624 --> 25:00.027
Every time you have sex, you give
away a little piece of your heart,

25:00.061 --> 25:02.029
and you give that away
too many times and...

25:03.131 --> 25:05.099
there's just nothing left

25:05.133 --> 25:07.868
and you've given away the most
important part of yourself.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.842
Right now, I feel like
I'm just taking from Amy.

25:14.876 --> 25:17.711
I've got nothing to give
back except her freedom,

25:17.746 --> 25:22.450
to let her go to New York
and just take a chance.

25:22.484 --> 25:24.452
She'll eventually love
me as much as I love her.

25:24.486 --> 25:27.421
Okay, one, you sound like a girl,

25:27.456 --> 25:29.457
and two, I think if you were
really, really in love with her,

25:29.491 --> 25:32.159
you'd feel a little more
passionate than that.

25:32.194 --> 25:35.062
Geez, I've got more passion for Kathy
and we're not even thinking about sex.

25:35.096 --> 25:36.030
Let's go.

25:42.370 --> 25:44.171
I did my best and that's all I can do.

25:44.206 --> 25:45.940
Are you talking about me or with Amy?

25:48.043 --> 25:49.777
It's as if Margaret just got me back
for every lecture she ever gave me.

25:54.816 --> 25:56.817
We want to surprise her.

25:56.852 --> 26:00.888
You're going to be surprising
a lot of people. Ethan, for one.

26:00.922 --> 26:06.360
I know. We didn't hit it off
exactly the first time we met, but...

26:06.394 --> 26:08.329
He's been a big part of her life, so...

26:08.363 --> 26:13.400
So... Come on. You can tell
me why you're really here.

26:16.104 --> 26:18.405
How the heck did you know
how to hack an E-diary?

26:18.440 --> 26:20.274
Uh, Dylan and her friends.

26:20.308 --> 26:22.209
Oh. Wait. But, still...

26:22.244 --> 26:24.111
You would have had to guess the password.

26:24.145 --> 26:25.880
People are not smart about passwords.

26:25.914 --> 26:28.215
They're pretty easy to guess.
It took me a few tries, but...

26:28.250 --> 26:29.984
Did she say anything about me?

26:30.018 --> 26:32.720
Nothing that you wouldn't
expect her to say about you.

26:32.754 --> 26:34.655
- Like what?
- Like...

26:34.689 --> 26:35.990
she's very jealous of you,

26:36.024 --> 26:39.493
she thinks you're a really
smart, beautiful woman who

26:39.528 --> 26:41.729
slept with the guy who she's going
to marry. Or, was going to marry.

26:41.763 --> 26:45.399
Oh, you're so full of it. She did
not say I was smart or beautiful.

26:45.433 --> 26:50.437
No, she did. She's jealous of you,
or she was for a long time but now...

26:50.472 --> 26:53.607
Well, I probably, shouldn't
tell you anything else.

26:53.642 --> 26:56.310
No! Don't do that! Don't bait
me! Tell me what she said.

26:56.344 --> 26:59.446
She said that, maybe,

26:59.481 --> 27:01.916
you and Ricky would
have been happy together

27:01.950 --> 27:04.985
and maybe she should have just
let the two of you stay together.

27:05.020 --> 27:07.855
She should have just let us stay together?

27:07.889 --> 27:10.224
Let us? Like she has it in her
powers to let us stay together?

27:11.893 --> 27:13.894
Yeah, she's out of her mind.

27:13.929 --> 27:17.631
If Ricky and I wanted to be
together, we would be together.

27:17.666 --> 27:19.567
We don't want to be together.

27:19.601 --> 27:21.602
Well, I don't want to be with him.

27:21.636 --> 27:23.671
Maybe he wants to be with me,

27:23.705 --> 27:25.739
but I think that's because he senses
Amy's going to call off this wedding again.

27:25.774 --> 27:27.508
So, you think she is
going to call it off then?

27:27.542 --> 27:29.843
Because it would certainly
simplify my life if she did.

27:29.878 --> 27:32.313
She said it out loud. She
doesn't want to get married.

27:32.347 --> 27:33.814
That doesn't mean she won't,

27:33.848 --> 27:36.517
I hope not, but very few people are
gutsy enough to call off a wedding.

27:36.551 --> 27:38.586
It was easy for them the
first time because they eloped,

27:38.620 --> 27:40.454
but this time, it's a different story.

27:40.538 --> 27:43.273
Oh, please. The day after graduation,

27:43.308 --> 27:45.309
she just disappears and goes to New York.

27:45.343 --> 27:46.343
- Easy.
- Maybe.

27:46.378 --> 27:49.046
Can you believe that after four years,

27:49.080 --> 27:52.182
you and I are still huddled
together talking about Ricky and Amy?

27:52.217 --> 27:54.351
Ugh. How long are we gonna keep doing this?

27:54.386 --> 27:56.987
Until Amy admits that she's
always been in love with me.

27:57.022 --> 27:58.889
Well, until then...

27:58.923 --> 28:00.057
you want to spend the night at the condo?

28:00.091 --> 28:03.093
Uh... Adrian I don't think so.

28:03.128 --> 28:05.095
Oh, Amy's not going to know.

28:05.130 --> 28:06.063
I'll know.

28:09.768 --> 28:10.934
Go wait in the car, I
want to talk to George.

28:10.969 --> 28:13.537
Story of my life. I can't
wait until I can drive.

28:13.571 --> 28:14.505
Yeah. Go.

28:17.575 --> 28:19.410
I would have dropped him
off before I came here,

28:19.444 --> 28:21.578
but if I have to get home to Amy
with the food, I can't go in with him.

28:21.613 --> 28:23.580
If you and Amy don't get married
the day after she graduates,

28:23.615 --> 28:26.383
even if she decides to leave you
and John behind to go to New York,

28:26.418 --> 28:28.485
as soon as she steps on that
plane, reality is going to set in

28:28.520 --> 28:29.620
and she'll come running back.

28:29.654 --> 28:31.622
Oh, I don't know about that, George.

28:31.656 --> 28:34.525
I know. Amy's my daughter and no
one knows her better than I know her.

28:34.559 --> 28:37.161
She loves you. And you love
her. And you both love John.

28:37.195 --> 28:39.096
So I don't know why she's
putting you through all this,

28:39.130 --> 28:40.097
but she's not going anywhere.

28:51.032 --> 28:52.900
Hi.

28:52.934 --> 28:54.768
- Good evening.
- I didn't do anything.

28:54.803 --> 28:56.637
Well, nobody said you did.

28:56.671 --> 28:57.705
Um...

28:57.739 --> 29:00.474
Edward needs your help surprising Kathy,

29:00.508 --> 29:01.842
and I told him, you'd be happy to help him.

29:01.877 --> 29:04.478
That depends. Surprising her how?

29:05.714 --> 29:07.581
Sit down. Uh...

29:07.616 --> 29:09.683
I'll just leave you two alone.

29:19.361 --> 29:21.462
Are you going to surprise
her that you're here?

29:21.496 --> 29:23.931
What's the surprise? What kind of surprise?

29:23.965 --> 29:26.000
Does she like surprises? I don't
really think she does. Does she?

29:26.034 --> 29:28.135
Well, I will tell you
if you don't interrupt me

29:28.169 --> 29:30.204
with any questions until I'm finished.

29:31.206 --> 29:32.973
The floor is yours.

29:33.008 --> 29:36.710
Kathy's mother and I haven't spent
very much time with Kathy this year

29:38.680 --> 29:40.948
because of her situation.

29:40.982 --> 29:43.817
So, we thought that it would be nice if

29:45.687 --> 29:48.789
we throw her a little
end-of-the-year party.

29:48.823 --> 29:53.627
Something that says, the year is
behind her, her life is ahead of her,

29:53.662 --> 29:56.397
she has friends and
family that believe in her

29:56.431 --> 30:00.234
and she's a wonderful young
woman with a bright future.

30:00.268 --> 30:01.535
Okay. You and Kathy, getting along?

30:02.270 --> 30:03.404
Yes.

30:03.438 --> 30:07.041
I hope things aren't getting too serious.

30:07.075 --> 30:09.910
I think you know what I mean. Well...

30:09.945 --> 30:13.113
Yeah, I know what you
mean, no, not too serious.

30:13.148 --> 30:15.149
But serious enough.

30:15.183 --> 30:17.151
Yeah. Serious enough.

30:19.187 --> 30:22.056
For what, sir? Serious enough for?

30:22.090 --> 30:27.695
Well, this is traditionally the time when
a young woman is presented to society.

30:27.729 --> 30:30.831
She's officially an adult
woman and ready for marriage.

30:30.865 --> 30:33.567
It's a little young, isn't it? Is it?

30:33.601 --> 30:35.703
Other cultures celebrate adulthood at 13.

30:35.737 --> 30:37.571
Do they?

30:37.605 --> 30:39.673
Well, I was certainly not an adult at 13.

30:39.708 --> 30:42.476
But you're 15, right?

30:42.510 --> 30:44.511
- You're almost an adult, too.
- Almost.

30:44.546 --> 30:48.248
That's why this party is
going to be special in that...

30:50.986 --> 30:52.152
we are giving our daughter to you.

30:53.922 --> 30:56.156
To you. To love and honor.

30:57.826 --> 30:58.959
To protect.

31:00.061 --> 31:01.862
To provide for. Uh...

31:04.132 --> 31:05.966
When you say provide for...

31:06.001 --> 31:07.768
Well, that can wait.

31:07.802 --> 31:09.670
Until you finish your education,

31:09.704 --> 31:13.540
and with your lack of
ability, that will probably

31:13.575 --> 31:14.875
just be high school, right?

31:14.909 --> 31:17.444
Oh, I don't know. Kathy's been
pushing me to go to college.

31:17.479 --> 31:19.346
Well, you can go to college
and work and be married.

31:19.381 --> 31:20.714
- What was that last part?
- Be married.

31:20.749 --> 31:21.749
Huh.

31:23.284 --> 31:25.185
So this is, basically,

31:26.354 --> 31:28.288
an engagement party?

31:28.323 --> 31:30.357
If she accepts your proposal
in front of family and friends.

31:30.392 --> 31:33.160
Oh. Awesome.

31:33.194 --> 31:34.294
She wants to come home to Houston

31:34.329 --> 31:37.164
because someone broke her heart.

31:37.198 --> 31:38.932
And what did I tell you not to do?

31:38.967 --> 31:41.135
Oh, lots of things.

31:41.169 --> 31:43.237
Including not to break her heart.

31:46.741 --> 31:47.941
So, why do you even want
me to come to this party?

31:47.976 --> 31:49.910
Are you an idiot?

31:49.944 --> 31:51.779
There is no party. I was lying.

31:51.813 --> 31:52.946
I was trying to get to the truth.

31:52.981 --> 31:54.948
And what the hell is wrong with you

31:54.983 --> 31:57.451
that you would break up with my daughter

31:57.485 --> 31:59.753
to have sex with some girl
who's calling her names

31:59.788 --> 32:02.389
- and making her life miserable?
- Oh, no.

32:02.424 --> 32:04.291
You take care of this.

32:05.293 --> 32:06.326
Right away.

32:17.205 --> 32:18.405
Say what? Uh...

32:18.440 --> 32:21.141
Layla's calling Kathy what names?

32:21.176 --> 32:23.243
How is she making her life miserable?

32:23.278 --> 32:27.981
She'd better not be making her life
miserable. And you better not be, either.

32:28.016 --> 32:29.983
Did you and that Layla have sex?

32:30.018 --> 32:31.885
No, Ricky kind of ruined that for me.

32:38.059 --> 32:40.961
I haven't seen this place in a while.

32:40.995 --> 32:42.696
Thanks for inviting me in.

32:42.730 --> 32:45.899
Well, technically, it's still
your condo, too, I think.

32:45.934 --> 32:47.768
Uh, no, it's your condo.

32:47.802 --> 32:50.637
Not everything about being
married to me was bad, was it?

32:50.672 --> 32:51.605
Well...

32:52.674 --> 32:54.741
tell me the truth.

32:54.776 --> 32:56.610
If Mercy had lived,

32:56.644 --> 33:00.147
do you think we'd really be
happy married to each other,

33:00.181 --> 33:01.281
raising a daughter together?

33:01.316 --> 33:04.151
I know you don't believe this, but yes,

33:04.185 --> 33:06.153
I would have been happy.

33:06.187 --> 33:08.055
I was happy.

33:08.089 --> 33:09.356
Until we lost her.

33:10.325 --> 33:12.226
And I just lost my way.

33:14.162 --> 33:15.963
I'm sorry, Ben.

33:16.998 --> 33:18.799
I'm sorry I wasn't nicer to you.

33:18.833 --> 33:22.703
No, if anyone owes anyone an
apology, it's me, I didn't...

33:23.138 --> 33:24.671
I didn't handle that well.

33:24.706 --> 33:26.874
I think we both handled it as well as

33:26.908 --> 33:28.675
two high school students
could have handled it.

33:35.650 --> 33:37.885
You know, you're more than
welcome to spend the night.

33:37.919 --> 33:41.655
As a friend, just a sleepover.

33:41.689 --> 33:45.726
You know, we can pop some
popcorn, watch a movie, hang out.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.594
I have school tomorrow. I better be going.

33:47.629 --> 33:51.365
All right. Well, it was
fun having dinner with you,

33:51.399 --> 33:55.335
and give up on Amy, all
right? She's not for you.

33:55.370 --> 33:57.271
And you give Omar a chance.

33:57.305 --> 33:59.406
Go to New York, go wherever he goes.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.475
He loves you, you know he loves you.

34:01.509 --> 34:03.977
Eh, there will be other guys for me

34:04.012 --> 34:06.213
and some day, there'll be the guy for me.

34:06.247 --> 34:08.916
- All right. Goodnight Adrian.
- Goodnight.

34:13.288 --> 34:15.188
Hey! What's going on?

34:15.223 --> 34:16.822
You got another hour.

34:16.858 --> 34:17.891
We'd like you to stay inside another hour,

34:17.926 --> 34:19.993
- if you don't mind.
- I do mind.

34:20.027 --> 34:21.962
Are you telling me I can't
leave for some reason?

34:21.996 --> 34:25.065
It's for your own safety, son. And
yes, I'm telling you, you can't leave.

34:31.806 --> 34:32.773
You've been really quiet.

34:33.641 --> 34:35.475
Yeah, I'm sorry.

34:35.510 --> 34:36.810
I just feel kind of tired or something.

34:36.844 --> 34:39.478
- I hope not tired of me.
- Why would you say that?

34:39.514 --> 34:41.447
- I was joking.
- Oh.

34:41.482 --> 34:43.650
Yeah. Of course, you were joking.

34:43.685 --> 34:45.619
On the other hand, Grace,

34:45.652 --> 34:47.454
I just get the feeling
that you're not as excited

34:47.487 --> 34:49.356
as I am about our engagement.

34:49.389 --> 34:51.091
Jack, honestly...

34:52.393 --> 34:54.061
when you put this ring on my finger,

34:54.094 --> 34:56.263
I was really, really surprised.

34:59.100 --> 35:01.868
This is just my first time
saying any of this out loud,

35:03.972 --> 35:07.774
but I kind of made a bargain with God

35:07.809 --> 35:11.144
that if he let you live,
I was gonna marry you

35:11.179 --> 35:13.914
and I was going to take care of
you for the rest of your life.

35:13.948 --> 35:15.682
Wow.

35:15.717 --> 35:17.784
That's pretty heavy.

35:17.819 --> 35:18.919
And now I have to tell you something

35:18.953 --> 35:20.754
that I haven't said out
loud to anyone either

35:20.788 --> 35:22.923
- and it completely freaks me out.
- What?

35:22.957 --> 35:25.525
When that guy was beating
the crap out of me,

35:25.560 --> 35:30.364
I promised God that if he let
me live, then I would marry you!

35:30.398 --> 35:32.499
My God, this is like some
kind of miracle or something.

35:32.533 --> 35:34.568
I don't know if it qualifies as a miracle.

35:34.602 --> 35:35.702
Okay, maybe not a miracle,

35:35.737 --> 35:38.305
but it's, like, divine intervention.

35:38.339 --> 35:40.307
Like God making the two of us get married.

35:40.341 --> 35:42.376
I don't think God is making us get married.

35:42.410 --> 35:46.113
Not making us, but making
us want to get married.

35:46.147 --> 35:49.216
It's so crazy, isn't it? I
mean, he shows us the way.

35:49.250 --> 35:52.219
You know, there's free will, but...

35:52.253 --> 35:54.288
Wow. Really, Grace, wow.

35:55.890 --> 35:57.024
We shouldn't wait, we really shouldn't.

35:57.058 --> 35:58.759
This holy union was meant to be.

35:58.793 --> 36:01.128
Which doesn't mean we
can't wait if we want to.

36:01.162 --> 36:03.764
We can wait.

36:03.798 --> 36:05.132
It would still be a
miracle if we got married.

36:05.166 --> 36:08.602
Oh, man. Life is just full of surprises.

36:09.704 --> 36:11.972
I needed this, Grace, I really needed this.

36:12.006 --> 36:14.641
I needed to be reminded of
the promise I made to God.

36:17.679 --> 36:19.546
- We should get the check.
- We got the check already.

36:19.580 --> 36:20.814
The meal didn't cost anything,

36:20.848 --> 36:22.416
but we should leave a tip for the waiter.

36:29.590 --> 36:33.560
You know, I feel like sometime
God's will is tricky, too.

36:33.594 --> 36:36.229
Like, he's not always so straightforward.

36:36.264 --> 36:39.466
Maybe he's trying to teach us a lesson

36:39.500 --> 36:42.369
in making promises that we
aren't able to always keep.

36:42.403 --> 36:44.104
And sometimes, he is straightforward

36:44.138 --> 36:46.940
and rewards us with good things. Let's go.

36:46.974 --> 36:49.042
Maybe you guys would like to
stick around a little bit longer.

36:50.178 --> 36:52.045
What?

36:52.080 --> 36:53.947
No, we're ready to leave, unless
you're telling us we can't leave.

36:53.981 --> 36:56.083
Hey you two, sit down. Let
me get you dessert and coffee.

36:56.117 --> 36:57.984
- Why?
- We've got the best desserts in town.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.721
No. I know what this is.

37:00.755 --> 37:02.689
It's going to be fine. Sit down.

37:17.726 --> 37:20.027
- Hi, Ethan.
- Kathy, thanks for taking my call.

37:20.061 --> 37:21.862
Pretty polite for a guy
who's just trying to have sex

37:21.896 --> 37:23.831
with anyone who will have sex with him.

37:23.865 --> 37:25.933
I didn't know Layla was
talking about you like that.

37:25.967 --> 37:28.769
- Yeah, you did.
- Okay, I did.

37:28.803 --> 37:30.904
I just wasn't going to admit
that I did until, you know,

37:31.773 --> 37:34.775
she and I did it.

37:34.809 --> 37:36.744
And then I was going to get all
indignant about it and tell her,

37:36.778 --> 37:39.546
- I never wanted to see her again.
- That's horrible.

37:39.581 --> 37:41.482
- You're a horrible person.
- I know.

37:43.351 --> 37:45.319
- But I'm honest.
- You're honest because you just

37:45.353 --> 37:48.589
told me about a big lie you were
going to tell me and tell Layla?

37:48.623 --> 37:50.290
- Yeah.
- That's not honest.

37:50.325 --> 37:52.159
Then how's this?

37:52.193 --> 37:54.461
I am driven by testosterone,
but I still have a brain

37:54.496 --> 37:57.264
so I don't know why I've
been acting so stupid.

37:57.298 --> 38:01.268
That's not who I am, some dumb
guy who just wants to get laid.

38:01.302 --> 38:03.137
I want to be in love.

38:03.171 --> 38:04.972
I am in love. I'm in love with you.

38:05.006 --> 38:06.306
Then why would you dump me the first time

38:06.341 --> 38:08.976
some other girl promises you
something that I won't give you?

38:09.010 --> 38:12.813
I don't know, I just feel
pressured to be a man.

38:12.847 --> 38:14.815
And that's what you think a man does?

38:14.849 --> 38:16.984
Has sex with any woman
he can just to have sex?

38:17.018 --> 38:20.788
Well, I kind of got that
impression when I was growing up.

38:20.822 --> 38:22.122
At home and in juvie. I don't know.

38:22.157 --> 38:24.725
It's true of a lot of guys.
A lot of guys are like that.

38:24.759 --> 38:28.562
Yeah, but Ethan, not
all guys are like that.

38:28.596 --> 38:29.830
And if there were no guys like that,

38:29.864 --> 38:32.933
if there were no guys using
women to just have sex,

38:32.967 --> 38:34.568
then think about it,

38:34.602 --> 38:36.603
there wouldn't be any
girls being used for sex

38:36.638 --> 38:38.405
there wouldn't be prostitution,

38:38.439 --> 38:39.540
there wouldn't be pornography,

38:39.574 --> 38:42.409
there wouldn't be human trafficking.

38:42.443 --> 38:44.545
Somehow, over the course of history,

38:44.579 --> 38:48.448
this misuse of sex has gotten
intertwined with violence

38:48.483 --> 38:51.451
and now there are millions
of women who are victims

38:51.486 --> 38:53.487
and it all starts with that guy

38:53.521 --> 38:55.122
who just has to have it.

38:55.156 --> 38:58.058
Uh, I wasn't buying, and
excuse me for saying so,

38:58.092 --> 39:00.093
but women want to have sex too, don't they?

39:00.128 --> 39:02.095
Yeah, but...

39:02.130 --> 39:03.964
when's the last time you heard of a woman

39:03.998 --> 39:05.999
who got caught paying for sex?

39:06.034 --> 39:08.101
Really.

39:08.136 --> 39:12.239
We do not victimize men or other women
to the extent that we are victimized.

39:12.273 --> 39:14.241
Which is not to say it never happens.

39:14.275 --> 39:17.144
I don't think we need to make such
a big issue out of this, do we?

39:17.178 --> 39:18.212
I said, I was sorry.

39:25.787 --> 39:28.856
I don't know, Mickey, I think
you ought to leave this one alone.

39:29.824 --> 39:31.058
You just got back into town.

39:31.092 --> 39:32.860
You should lay low, relax.

39:32.894 --> 39:34.661
No.

39:34.696 --> 39:36.897
I don't feel like relaxing.

39:36.931 --> 39:39.833
I'll relax after I teach her a lesson.

39:39.868 --> 39:41.001
I own her.

39:41.035 --> 39:43.704
You'll still own her
next week or next month.

39:43.738 --> 39:45.839
It's too soon.

39:45.874 --> 39:48.508
I don't trust that she's
ready to leave this situation.

39:48.543 --> 39:51.545
- She's got it made there.
- I got her under control.

39:51.579 --> 39:54.414
She knows she doesn't deserve to
live in some big house like that,

39:54.449 --> 39:55.816
with those rich people.

39:55.850 --> 39:56.850
She belongs to me.

39:58.553 --> 40:00.654
And there she is, my little Ginger.

40:02.590 --> 40:05.359
It's a shame I'm gonna have
to mess up that face, but...

40:07.595 --> 40:09.329
I'll be right back.

40:22.477 --> 40:25.245
Did you miss me? Because I missed you.

40:26.247 --> 40:27.514
I love you, baby.

40:29.250 --> 40:31.318
Come on, Ginger, let's go home.

40:32.487 --> 40:33.453
Stop right there!

40:39.193 --> 40:40.127
Don't move!

40:43.464 --> 40:48.101
You are so stupid to think
I would ever go back to you.

40:48.136 --> 40:49.336
What an idiot!

40:49.370 --> 40:52.272
You got out of the
country and you came back?

40:52.307 --> 40:53.407
I love it!

40:53.441 --> 40:56.076
Who's controlling who now?

40:56.110 --> 40:58.045
I mean, whom.

40:58.079 --> 41:00.247
I'm in school, where
girls my age should be,

41:00.281 --> 41:03.283
not out on the street
working for guys like you.

41:03.318 --> 41:05.152
Have fun in prison!

41:05.186 --> 41:07.020
I hope the guys are nice to you,

41:07.055 --> 41:09.089
you know, like they were nice to me.

41:09.123 --> 41:10.257
I'll see you again.

41:10.291 --> 41:12.893
Maybe when you come up
for parole the first time

41:12.927 --> 41:15.896
and the second time and the third time.

41:15.930 --> 41:16.930
Let's go, Chloe.

41:57.038 --> 41:59.039
If you want me to hear what Adrian said,

41:59.073 --> 42:00.307
then you're going to have
to say it to me yourself.

42:02.243 --> 42:05.045
This is it, Amy. You're in or you're out.
