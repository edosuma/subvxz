WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:08.467
Remember everything
I made you forget.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.138
Whoa.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.348
Maybe Cate's more powerful
than we thought.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.308
Sometimes the thoughts
are so loud,

00:16.392 --> 00:17.810
<i>I feel like I'm going crazy.</i>

00:17.893 --> 00:20.604
What if I told you
we could make the voices stop?

00:20.688 --> 00:23.315
<i>What I've asked you to do</i>
<i>is difficult.</i>

00:23.399 --> 00:25.067
Forget about The Woods.
Your brother is dead.

00:25.151 --> 00:27.862
You're the only one
who can keep your friends safe.

00:27.945 --> 00:31.365
There are dangerous,
evil people at that school.

00:31.449 --> 00:32.450
What kind of hero is too fucking

00:32.533 --> 00:34.285
chickenshit to do anything
heroic? Fuck you.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.036
You can't trust anyone.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.997
<i>[Cardosa] I want the girl.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:40.291
She doesn't understand
how powerful

00:40.374 --> 00:41.917
<i>she really is.</i>

00:42.001 --> 00:43.335
She has a benefactor,
and because of that,

00:43.419 --> 00:45.254
she's strictly off-limits.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.839
<i>[Cate] They were using Sam</i>
<i>to augment Luke's powers.</i>

00:46.922 --> 00:48.758
What the fuck
are you guys doing to me?!

00:48.841 --> 00:49.925
<i>[Cate] But they were doing</i>
<i>other stuff, too.</i>

00:50.009 --> 00:52.011
The virus only affects Supes.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.345
Shetty was directing it all.

00:53.429 --> 00:54.889
We killed a Supe.

00:54.972 --> 00:55.890
So, she's the answer.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.433
Now can you make it contagious?

01:00.603 --> 01:02.521
<i>- [grunting]</i>
<i>- [Rich] Ugh! Get off me.</i>

01:02.605 --> 01:04.648
<i>Get the fuck off me, man!</i>

01:07.777 --> 01:08.944
- [guard] Settle down!
- What did I do?

01:09.028 --> 01:10.237
- What the fuck did I do?
- Watch it.

01:11.322 --> 01:14.325
- [lock clunks]
- Hey! Fuck you!

01:14.408 --> 01:15.785
[panting]

01:15.868 --> 01:18.078
Try not to breathe.

01:18.162 --> 01:20.164
[labored breathing, wheezing]

01:26.295 --> 01:27.546
[coughs]

01:32.218 --> 01:33.511
[coughs]

01:33.594 --> 01:34.845
Andy?

01:34.929 --> 01:36.680
[coughs]

01:36.764 --> 01:39.350
[whimpers]
What did they do to you?

01:39.433 --> 01:42.061
[retches]

01:43.771 --> 01:44.855
Help!

01:44.939 --> 01:47.942
Please! Please, let us out!

01:48.025 --> 01:49.276
Please!

01:51.111 --> 01:53.239
[crying] We're sorry.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.910
We're sorry.

02:00.746 --> 02:01.789
[speaker beeps off]

02:04.458 --> 02:05.709
How long will it take?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.419
Well, transmission occurs

02:07.503 --> 02:10.214
through direct contact
with bodily fluids, so,

02:10.297 --> 02:11.841
depending on
Andy's viral load...

02:11.924 --> 02:13.092
Can't we make it airborne?

02:14.301 --> 02:15.302
Why?

02:15.386 --> 02:17.263
So it's more contagious.

02:18.389 --> 02:21.267
I think we need to
take a beat and assess

02:21.350 --> 02:22.977
what our long-term goals are.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.311
I'm quite clear on that.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.397
Because...

02:26.480 --> 02:28.065
if an airborne virus

02:28.148 --> 02:30.401
gets into
the super-abled population,

02:30.484 --> 02:32.319
it could spread like wildfire.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.575
Define "wildfire."

02:38.784 --> 02:40.578
I'm doubtful

02:40.661 --> 02:42.121
Vought would want us

02:42.204 --> 02:46.333
to entertain anything
so reckless, Indira.

02:47.543 --> 02:48.794
It's a little late in the day

02:48.878 --> 02:51.630
to worry about
what Vought wants, Edison.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.718
And, uh,

02:55.801 --> 02:59.054
what would happen if I
informed Vought of this?

03:00.431 --> 03:03.475
I don't know, you tell me.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.686
What would happen
if you told Vought

03:05.769 --> 03:09.106
you'd created a virus
that kills Supes?

03:10.357 --> 03:12.026
I didn't. I...

03:12.109 --> 03:14.653
I didn't know. I never signed on

03:14.737 --> 03:16.322
- for any of this.
- Of course you did.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.073
This is your brainchild.

03:18.157 --> 03:21.118
- You invented it.
- [phone ringing]

03:24.622 --> 03:26.707
And now you're gonna finish it.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.339
- [door opens]
- Fuck.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.965
- Hello, sweetheart.
- [door closes]

03:35.049 --> 03:36.258
<i>[Cate] I need to see you.</i>

03:36.342 --> 03:38.093
What's wrong?
Has something happened?

03:39.470 --> 03:42.431
Everything is just
so fucked-up right now.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.141
Please, can I come over?

03:44.224 --> 03:47.811
[sighs] Damn, I have a meeting
in the city that I can't move.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.897
Go to my house,
fix yourself something to eat.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.150
<i>I'll be there soon and</i>
<i>I'll take care of everything.</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
All right.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.195
You take your medication today?

03:56.278 --> 03:57.905
Yeah.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.075
Take another.
You'll feel better.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.285
It'll be all right, Cate.
I promise.

04:03.369 --> 04:04.411

The fuck does that mean?

04:43.701 --> 04:44.952
[sighs] Where is she?

04:45.035 --> 04:47.538
The city. She'll be back later.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.832
- So what do we do?
- [Cate] I'll wait for her

04:49.915 --> 04:53.544
at her house, and then,
when she comes home,

04:53.627 --> 04:56.171
I'll make her tell
everyone everything.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.674
<i>[Jordan] Fucking liar. Can't</i>
<i>wait to go run back to Shetty.</i>

04:58.757 --> 05:00.384

05:01.468 --> 05:02.386

05:02.469 --> 05:04.555
- I'll go with her.
- It's okay.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.141
No. I'm going.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.308
You can trust me.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.269
Stay out of our fucking heads.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.729
Then maybe we'll trust you.

Jordan.

- [entry bells jingle]

I swear, you can.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.074
I know you do.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.534

05:27.828 --> 05:30.205
- Do you believe me?
- [entry bells jingle]

05:34.418 --> 05:36.336
You already know.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.382
[sighs]

05:42.134 --> 05:43.177
Hey.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.720
Fucking stop for a minute.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.847
She was reading
our thoughts, Marie.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.390
You know, she probably
can't help it.

05:48.474 --> 05:51.185
- Why are you making
excuses for her? - I'm not.

05:51.268 --> 05:54.521
Look, she could fuck with
our heads any time she wants to,

05:54.605 --> 05:55.606
and she's not.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.232
We have to believe
she's on our side.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.400
[scoffs]

05:58.484 --> 06:00.402
And you got to stop
turning into a dude

06:00.486 --> 06:01.862
when you want to
make a point to us.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.908
- Fine.
- Fine.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.621
[laughing]

06:31.725 --> 06:32.768
We need Cate.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.438
She's the only way to get Shetty
to expose The Woods.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.857
Unless we get proof ourselves.

06:38.941 --> 06:39.900
How?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.610
Shetty's in the city all day.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.238
I got the key to her office.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.073
I'm her T.A., remember?

06:46.156 --> 06:47.783
Look, we find proof
about The Woods,

06:47.866 --> 06:50.536
or what they've done to Sam
and those other kids down there,

06:50.619 --> 06:51.912
it doesn't matter
what Cate does.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.540
And then what? Post it on Insta?

06:54.623 --> 06:57.960
You think they're gonna
believe a Black girl

06:58.043 --> 06:59.795
and a bi-gender Asian Supe

06:59.878 --> 07:01.964
over Vought? No.
They're just gonna

07:02.047 --> 07:04.049
twist it like they twist
everything else.

07:11.682 --> 07:15.394
Unless we get it to someone
they will listen to.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.240
[Emma] Okay, these
are all your clothes.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.366
I'm gonna take these to this guy

07:29.449 --> 07:30.868
from my Voice
and Movement class.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.829
I mean, he's kind of sketch,
but for five ecstasy pills,

07:33.912 --> 07:35.622
he'll use his pyro powers
to incinerate everything,

07:35.706 --> 07:37.416
no questions asked,
which is good.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.626
And then...

07:39.710 --> 07:42.171
it'll be like
it never even happened, right?

07:42.254 --> 07:43.255
Right.

07:43.338 --> 07:47.384
I did rip
an entire person in half.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.679
- Yeah.
- I mean,

07:50.762 --> 07:53.557
in my defense, he was a puppet

07:53.640 --> 07:55.517
at the time, so...

07:58.187 --> 07:59.271
I know,

07:59.354 --> 08:01.190
but maybe you didn't do that

08:01.273 --> 08:02.983
because now
I'm destroying the evidence

08:03.066 --> 08:05.527
and who even remembers now?
I don't.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.529
[buzzing]

08:08.989 --> 08:10.699
You have so many things.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.285
Okay, that is
a normal amount of sex toys.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.413
I like options.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.456
- [buzzing stops]
- Oh.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.541
Okay. Okay.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.836
I stole these
from the laundry room for you.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.130
I think they're clean?

08:25.214 --> 08:27.799
No, I-I like what
I'm wearing. It...

08:27.883 --> 08:29.134
smells like you.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.055
Oh, no, no, no.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.097
You got to stay here.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.807
- Right.
- Yeah.

08:35.891 --> 08:36.808
No one can know where you are.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.268
That makes sense. Yeah.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.269
I'll be super quick.

08:39.353 --> 08:40.562
I mean, I can get you food, too.

08:40.646 --> 08:41.730
You got to be starving.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.523
Oh, w-will that take you
a very long time?

08:43.607 --> 08:44.566
No. No, there's
a Vought-A-Burger

08:44.650 --> 08:45.692
right in student union.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.070
You won't even know
that I'm gone.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.571
Okay?

08:49.655 --> 08:52.366
The last time
I had Vought-A-Burger

08:52.449 --> 08:53.909
I was with Luke.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.702
Fuck.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.331
Sam.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.960
Everything you've gone through,

09:03.043 --> 09:04.211
I mean, I'd be fucked-up.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.754
I mean,

09:05.837 --> 09:07.214
I'd be really fucked-up.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.924
But you're so sweet.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.802
I mean, when you're not
slaughtering a bunch of dudes.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.011
[chuckles]

09:13.095 --> 09:15.055
Do not answer the door,
no matter what.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.598
Okay.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.350
- Stranger danger.
- Stranger danger.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.352
Stranger danger. Yup. All right.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.814
Bye.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.490
What's that?

10:15.574 --> 10:17.326
I don't know.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.662
This was hidden in her drawer.

10:20.746 --> 10:23.749
All this stuff
about a plane crash.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.043
Transoceanic Flight 37.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.127
[Jordan] Yeah, I remember that.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.670
It was terrorists, right?

10:28.754 --> 10:30.213
Yeah, that's what they said.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.847
Oh, my God, look.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.184
[Jordan] Shetty, Lily, age 11.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.478
Shetty, Paul, age 46.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.315
Her family was on the plane.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.237
[door beeps]

10:55.447 --> 10:57.115
[sighs]

10:58.116 --> 11:01.870
Oh, Shetty, Shetty, Shetty.

11:01.953 --> 11:06.208
You want me to increase
the viral infection rate.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.709
Right.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.842
Kill them all, she says.

11:15.926 --> 11:19.679
And sign my own
death certificate.

A chat with a celebrated
Vought psychologist

12:39.384 --> 12:41.678
who's now dean of their

12:41.761 --> 12:43.346
Who could resist?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.598
You've got two minutes.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.433
You'll want longer.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.942
I'm sorry, this is at the
school, and Vought doesn't know?

12:56.026 --> 12:58.069
We're estimating about
ten months to make it potent

12:58.153 --> 13:00.030
and contagious enough
to get the job done.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.365
It's getting harder to hide.
That's why I need you.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.909
For what, exactly?

13:05.035 --> 13:06.745
I know you monitor Supes.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.122
Their team affiliations,
their whereabouts.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.624
You know where
to find all of them,

13:10.707 --> 13:12.375
even those that aren't
under Vought's thumb.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.086
We'll be able to neutralize them
once and for all.

13:15.170 --> 13:18.507
What you're describing
goes beyond neutralizing.

13:18.590 --> 13:19.799
It's a war crime.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.384
This is a war. Us against them.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.803
And so far, they've been
winning. The virus gives us

13:23.887 --> 13:25.222
a way to fight back.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.556
It's genocide.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.642
You need to stop
what you're doing immediately.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.185
If Vought gets wind of this,

13:30.268 --> 13:32.646
the Supes will crush you
and everyone you care about.

13:32.729 --> 13:33.897
Too late for that.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.317
No matter how many
of them you kill,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.319
none of this is going to
bring your husband

13:39.402 --> 13:40.946
and daughter back.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.201
Or your grandchildren.

It's so consumed him
that there's nothing left.

Trust me, you don't want
to go down that path.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.513
I'm doing this
with or without you.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.181
With you would be easier.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.850
Together,
we can end it, finally.

Or I could have you
arrested, or committed.

you two talked?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.852
When I found out
he was Vought's bitch,

18:22.936 --> 18:24.896
and when he told me
not to rescue the kids

18:24.979 --> 18:27.148
that were trapped in the prison
under the school, so...

18:28.942 --> 18:29.943
I'm sorry.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.695
You know, when I was a kid,

18:32.779 --> 18:34.572
I wanted to be just like him.

18:36.241 --> 18:39.160
But after everything
we know about this place...

18:40.662 --> 18:42.413
...you'd have to be
a fucking idiot

18:42.497 --> 18:43.873
to think any of it matters.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.335
I just can't trust him.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.462
So, that's why
I haven't talked to him.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.758
And if I did, he'd probably
just go to Vought anyway, so...

18:53.842 --> 18:56.344
Is that what you think of me?

18:56.427 --> 18:58.680
That I'm just gonna
tell Shetty everything?

19:03.017 --> 19:05.770

can be a superhero.

21:47.098 --> 21:50.184
Ms. Neuman, you claim
that the FBSA is here

21:50.268 --> 21:51.686
to protect people
from superheroes,

21:51.769 --> 21:53.271
but at your own
congressional hearing,

21:53.354 --> 21:55.023

multiple people,

21:55.106 --> 21:56.482
and on a separate occasion,

21:57.775 --> 21:59.402
thousands of innocent people
in Manhattan.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.242
Look, Cameron, the thing
that you need to remember here

22:06.325 --> 22:09.412
is that both those instances
caused a 30% drop

22:09.495 --> 22:11.831
of public confidence
in superhumans.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.541
And the FBSA responded

22:13.624 --> 22:15.001
by actually
strengthening protection

22:15.084 --> 22:17.587
of both humans
and superhumans alike,

22:17.670 --> 22:19.464

- [applause]

22:24.302 --> 22:26.179

22:28.848 --> 22:31.225

minority groups?

22:31.309 --> 22:33.394
Which is why they deserve
to have a voice.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.771

22:34.854 --> 22:37.190

33:09.530 --> 33:11.407
Just, like,
the smell alone is-is...

33:11.490 --> 33:12.991
- [chuckles]
- horrifying.

33:13.075 --> 33:15.035
[both laugh]

33:17.830 --> 33:20.082
They were wrong about you
and your powers, Marie.

33:20.165 --> 33:23.794
You are a very rare
and exceptional girl.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.296
Thank you.

33:29.591 --> 33:32.428
Okay, enough nostalgia
for one day.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.097
You had something important
you wanted to tell me, right?

33:37.391 --> 33:39.852
There's a secret lab

33:39.935 --> 33:41.603
under this school

33:41.687 --> 33:42.688
called The Woods

33:42.771 --> 33:45.524
where they experiment on kids.

33:45.607 --> 33:48.193
They're infecting them with
a virus that can kill Supes.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.821
A virus? Are you sure?

33:50.904 --> 33:53.407
There's a Dr. Cardosa.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.909
He-he works in The Woods.
He knows all about it.

33:55.993 --> 34:00.330
Look, you have to tell everyone
what Vought is doing.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.292
I'll handle it.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.710
- Handle it?
- Yeah.

34:04.793 --> 34:07.129
What... what does that mean?

34:07.212 --> 34:10.257
That means I got it
from here, Marie, okay?

34:10.340 --> 34:12.009
- You can go back
to being a student. - What?

34:12.092 --> 34:13.844
No, no. I can't just go back

34:13.927 --> 34:16.472
to being a student when this
whole fucking school is a lie.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.056
Listen to me.

34:18.140 --> 34:19.892
God U is your shot

34:19.975 --> 34:22.060
at finally having
some control over your life.

34:22.144 --> 34:26.023
Once Vought stashes people like
you and me inside Red River,

34:26.106 --> 34:27.483
it's fucking impossible
to break out

34:27.566 --> 34:30.652
of that orphanage to institution
pipeline without help.

34:30.736 --> 34:31.653
Trust me.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.364
Look, I have a platform

34:34.448 --> 34:36.366
now where I can help people.

34:36.450 --> 34:40.496
I mean, isn't that the entire
point of being a superhero?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.539
You don't have shit.
Marie Moreau,

34:42.623 --> 34:43.999
Guardian of Godolkin,

34:44.082 --> 34:46.126
is marketing, okay?

34:46.210 --> 34:48.420
And you better believe
that Vought will ship her off

34:48.504 --> 34:51.089
to the adult facility if she
keeps fucking up her situation.

34:52.883 --> 34:56.553
But the first Black woman
in The Seven,

34:56.637 --> 34:58.722
she has real power.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.432
She's friends
with the vice president.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.601
That woman, she could
make a real difference

35:02.684 --> 35:04.269
politically, culturally.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.357
Maybe she can even
find Annabeth.

35:10.651 --> 35:12.611
Two paths, Marie.

35:12.694 --> 35:16.490
You have to choose.
You can't have both.

35:18.826 --> 35:21.578
Let's keep in touch.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.005
[shaky exhale]

35:32.089 --> 35:33.549
[phone chimes]

35:38.554 --> 35:40.556
[machine beeping]

35:52.985 --> 35:55.612
S-Sorry I haven't been around.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.247
[phone buzzes]

36:17.301 --> 36:19.011
I'm here.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.263
[sniffles]

36:40.198 --> 36:41.867
Cate?

36:47.664 --> 36:49.541
Cate?

36:49.625 --> 36:51.501
Are you okay?

36:51.585 --> 36:52.628
Your eye...

36:52.711 --> 36:54.129
- What happened?
- [Cate] I'm okay,

36:54.212 --> 36:57.132
and now she'll do
whatever we want.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.009
Maybe you should rest.

36:59.092 --> 37:00.469
I feel fine.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.305
It wasn't my powers
that were fucking me up.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.098
It was the pills
she was giving me.

37:05.182 --> 37:07.267
- I've never felt better.
- [Shetty] Cate.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.019
Listen to your friends.
They care about you.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.103
Shut up.

37:10.187 --> 37:11.521
You had your chance to talk,

37:11.605 --> 37:13.607
and now it's my turn.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.193
Please, Cate, you don't
have to do this. I love you.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.861
[Cate] I know you love me.

37:17.945 --> 37:20.322
It doesn't change the fact
that you're a fucking bitch.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.324
Cate, what the fuck is going on?

37:22.407 --> 37:24.701
Don't worry,
we're on the same side.

37:24.785 --> 37:27.245
Okay, sorry, can I get
a quick SparkNotes version?

37:27.329 --> 37:29.539
'Cause I have no idea what the
fuck you guys are talking about.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.335
Tell them what you told me.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.381
This school is a front.

37:37.464 --> 37:40.592
Thomas Godolkin
was a behavioral scientist.

37:40.676 --> 37:42.761
He built this place
to figure out

37:42.844 --> 37:44.346
what makes Supes tick,

37:44.429 --> 37:47.557
their weaknesses,
how to control them.

37:48.976 --> 37:50.268
You're not here to study.

37:50.352 --> 37:53.438
The school is here to study you.

37:53.522 --> 37:55.649
You're subjects. Not human.

37:55.732 --> 37:56.942
We're better than humans.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.946
We found out she
has some kind of virus

38:01.029 --> 38:02.447
to kill the kids in The Woods.

38:02.531 --> 38:04.408
She wants to make it
more contagious.

38:04.491 --> 38:07.202
She wants more than that.
Don't you?

38:07.285 --> 38:10.163
I want it to spread
across the globe

38:10.247 --> 38:11.581
and kill all of you.

38:11.665 --> 38:14.543
Holy fuck.

38:15.544 --> 38:18.130
Why? We don't want to hurt you

38:18.213 --> 38:19.965
or anyone. You know that.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.675
Don't lie. Tell her.

38:23.427 --> 38:24.845
Homelander.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.432
So... so all this
because he lasered

38:28.515 --> 38:30.767
that Starlighter dude?

38:30.851 --> 38:32.227
No, sorry, it's fucked-up,
don't get me wrong,

38:32.310 --> 38:34.396
but, like, killing
all of us seems...

38:34.479 --> 38:37.024
seems a little melodramatic.

38:37.107 --> 38:38.734
Homelander?

38:41.862 --> 38:43.822
He took down that plane?

38:43.905 --> 38:46.616
He killed your family?

38:48.160 --> 38:50.120
It's not just him.

38:51.371 --> 38:54.291
You all leave a path
of destruction behind you.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.668
You have ruined countless lives.

38:56.752 --> 38:58.003
Just look at what
you did to your parents.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.630
You can't help it.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.592
It's your species.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.094
Tell them what your
last assignment was for me.

39:07.137 --> 39:08.513
Kill everybody in The Woods.

39:08.597 --> 39:10.724
[Jordan] Jesus Christ. Did you?

39:10.807 --> 39:12.893
Of course not, Jordan.
I'm trying to show you

39:12.976 --> 39:15.020
what kind of a monster she is.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.522
She wants to wipe us off
the face of the Earth.

39:17.606 --> 39:19.649
They all do,

39:19.733 --> 39:22.194
so we have to strike first.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.029
Starting with her.

39:24.112 --> 39:26.323
Cate, make me forget.
We can start over.

39:26.406 --> 39:27.699
- I'm gonna take care of you.
- Shut up. Shut up.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.367
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

39:29.451 --> 39:31.411
- Cate!
- Indira.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.665
- It's time.
- [heavy breathing]

39:35.749 --> 39:37.584
Fuck. Cate.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.127
- [Emma] Holy shit.
- [Jordan] Cate.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.879
Oh, my fucking God.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.130
Holy fuck.

39:42.214 --> 39:43.632
- No.
- Don't help.

39:45.133 --> 39:48.261
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck.

39:48.345 --> 39:49.763
Marie, do something!

39:49.846 --> 39:52.974
Cate. Cate, you don't need
to do this.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.393
We have Neuman.
She's gonna stop her.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.395
We can't trust anybody.
They'll only hurt us.

39:57.479 --> 39:58.814
This is the only way.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.191
[Shetty gasping]

40:01.274 --> 40:04.611
- Baby girl...
- [crying]

40:04.694 --> 40:05.987
Cate, Cate.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.907
Cate, please. Please.

40:08.990 --> 40:11.326
You have to let me save her.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.411
I'm so sorry
you have to relive this.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.516
Cate...

40:34.599 --> 40:37.602
do you know what you've done?

40:37.686 --> 40:39.020
Justice.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.863
For all of us.

40:52.826 --> 40:56.121
The virus isn't
very contagious, thank God.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.373
It can survive for a few days
at ambient temperature,

40:58.456 --> 41:00.584
but, you'll want to get
these test tubes

41:00.667 --> 41:02.752
into cold storage
sooner than later.

41:02.836 --> 41:05.881
NIH will know what to do.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.299
Speaking out against Vought

41:07.382 --> 41:09.467
takes a lot of courage,
Dr. Cardosa.

41:09.551 --> 41:11.970
I was so relieved

41:12.053 --> 41:14.014
when you contacted me
about my research.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.891
I could not stand by any longer

41:15.974 --> 41:19.394
while Dean Shetty
twisted my work.

41:19.477 --> 41:22.898
You and I have
the same goals, right?

41:22.981 --> 41:24.691
Compassionate control.

41:24.774 --> 41:27.319
That is such a great phrase.

41:27.402 --> 41:28.612
Do you mind if I steal that?

41:28.695 --> 41:30.739
Sure. It's all yours.

41:32.032 --> 41:35.410
And you'll get me and my family
out before things take a turn.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.495
- Witness protection, right?
- Yeah.

41:37.579 --> 41:38.830
Already taken care of.

41:41.374 --> 41:43.543
- Is this all of it?
- Yeah.

41:43.627 --> 41:45.587
And... you're the only one

41:45.670 --> 41:47.047
who knows how
to replicate it, right?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.594
We'll make sure this stays
out of the wrong hands.

42:01.394 --> 42:03.271
Hey.

42:03.355 --> 42:06.733
You're a 21st-century
American hero, Dr. Cardosa.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.485
[chuckles]

42:18.036 --> 42:19.663
Oh.

42:19.746 --> 42:20.956
The air must be a little dry.
