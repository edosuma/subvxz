Ja-sung, believe me!
I'm not a rat!

01:23.584 --> 01:28.589
Think about it,
I served the chairman for ages,

01:28.589 --> 01:33.302
why would I betray him
and snitch for the feds?

01:34.428 --> 01:35.429

Come on, let's just go.

06:05.908 --> 06:11.580
Yo bro, what's with the sour face?
I've been gone for a long time.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.708
You left a few days ago,
we don't have time for this shit.

you're happy to see me!

06:49.910 --> 06:53.414
I sold my left ball
to buy this bad boy.

06:54.081 --> 06:57.501
How is it?
Do I look like a celeb?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.297
Cricket chirping...

07:06.093 --> 07:07.803
How's the old man?

07:08.095 --> 07:12.933
It might be today or tomorrow,
the doctors can't say for sure.

07:12.933 --> 07:17.229
Goddammit,
at least he'll die happy.

07:17.980 --> 07:22.276
Why did he have to get
his dick wet at that hour?

07:22.568 --> 07:26.572
He got what he deserved
for never sharing his Viagra.

07:30.576 --> 07:34.997
I doubt someone
put a hit on him.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.505
Very nice.

07:44.006 --> 07:50.012

08:02.399 --> 08:03.567

08:05.194 --> 08:08.489

for your wife.

08:08.697 --> 08:11.408
In exchange for a healthy baby.

08:12.784 --> 08:16.997
- Knock-offs again?
- What? You ungrateful...

08:16.997 --> 08:20.000
I got certificate of authenticity!

08:20.000 --> 08:23.295
Forget it, give it to your wife.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.215
Please stop buying shit like this!

08:32.804 --> 08:33.597
So obvious?

08:36.933 --> 08:37.808
This one too?

08:40.437 --> 08:42.063
Not as much.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.988
You motherfucker!
He says it's obvious!

08:49.988 --> 08:54.785
You said it looked legit!
You lying sack of shit!

08:54.785 --> 08:57.079
You should've looked carefully!

09:58.599 --> 10:00.017
- Say what?!
- Boss!

10:00.017 --> 10:01.518
- Boss!
- Who's dead?!

10:01.518 --> 10:02.936
- Let go of me!
- Please calm down.

10:02.936 --> 10:07.065
If you were paid that much,
bring him back to life!

10:07.065 --> 10:10.485
- Please stop, sir!
- Let go of me!

10:10.485 --> 10:13.697

Get him down here!

- Yes, boss.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.902
Get their mugshots.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.905
We might bump
into them later.

12:59.905 --> 13:00.781
Yes, boss!

13:00.781 --> 13:01.990
Get your cameras out.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.909
- Smile for the camera,

hounding us?

13:07.412 --> 13:10.999

You sons of bitches.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.002
I'll stalk your bitch, son.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.007
You think you're so
famous and shit?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.928
We're checking up
on our favorite hooligans.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.932
This is all busted,
what do you say to that?

13:26.932 --> 13:29.518
So lieutenant KANG is
behind it all?

13:30.101 --> 13:33.396

painful enough?

13:33.396 --> 13:37.567
So what brought you here
with your minions?

13:37.567 --> 13:43.907
Are you fucking deaf?
I told you we're here to work,

13:44.199 --> 13:46.284
checking up on criminals.

13:46.284 --> 13:50.288
Don't worry about us,
go bury the old man.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.790
Goddammit.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.584
How can we,
when you're being so blatant?

13:54.584 --> 13:55.794
I'm not blind.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.797
Should I make you then?

14:01.925 --> 14:07.514
Your foul mouth
hasn't changed one bit.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.015
But you better watch out.

14:09.724 --> 14:13.311
It may lead to
your unfortunate demise.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.567
- Wanna bet?
- What?

14:18.567 --> 14:22.404
Whose head will roll first,
yours or mine.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.573

14:25.282 --> 14:26.575

14:27.576 --> 14:33.582
There's plenty of space
beside the old man's grave.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.501
Stupid pricks.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.087
And this is the latest model.

14:39.504 --> 14:43.717
Ink on the receipt
isn't even dry yet.

14:55.437 --> 14:59.774
Buy yourself some smokes
with the change.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.783
Oh yeah, I got a promotion!

15:09.784 --> 15:11.995
I'm a section chief now.
Don't forget!

15:11.995 --> 15:14.080
Fucking cops...

15:14.080 --> 15:19.794
Since we're all acquainted,
fetch us some food while at it.

15:19.794 --> 15:23.298
I saw steaks heading in there.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.216
Is it certified Korean beef?

15:32.223 --> 15:34.100
You fucking idiots.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.688
I want a written apology
for this.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.398
Yes, sir.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.282
<i>This is SEOK Dong-choc!</i>

15:49.282 --> 15:51.076
As the chairman of Goldmoon,

15:51.076 --> 15:54.913
he transformed the Jaebum gang
into a national crime syndicate.

15:55.497 --> 16:01.419
He died in a car crash 2 weeks ago
on his way back from his mistress.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.589
I heard, so?

16:04.589 --> 16:09.928
Because of his sudden death,
his seat remains vacant.

16:10.929 --> 16:16.518
As you know, Goldmoon is
an amalgamation of the Jaebum,

16:16.518 --> 16:20.480
Jeil and Northmoon gangs,
the largest syndicate in Korea.

16:20.480 --> 16:25.193
They pushed into an enterprise model,
and now owns 8 subsidiaries,

16:25.193 --> 16:27.278
growing into a mid-size corporation.

16:27.487 --> 16:32.993
We may never be able to
contain them ever again,

16:32.993 --> 16:35.078
if we do not take action now.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.287
To the point.

16:37.288 --> 16:41.292
We'll influence their succession plan.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.715
Who're the candidates?

16:48.717 --> 16:51.511
JUNG Chung,
Goldmoon executive director.

16:51.511 --> 16:57.100
He's in charge of construction,
and has close ties with the triads.

16:57.726 --> 17:01.479
He's a Chinese descendant,
and former head of Northmoon,

17:01.479 --> 17:05.483
until he joined forces
with Jaebum's SEOK.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.278
Since he handles Goldmoon's
main business,

17:09.194 --> 17:14.409
he's the heir apparent
even though officially he's third in line.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.994
- Opposition?
- LEE Joong-gu.

17:16.994 --> 17:20.415
Goldmoon's managing director
and 4th in line.

17:20.582 --> 17:24.294
He handles private loans, pyramids
and entertainment businesses,

17:24.502 --> 17:30.008
he was Jaebum's #2 under SEOK,
but JUNG Chung pushed him down.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.302
So they're in constant conflict.

17:33.094 --> 17:37.599
Still, he's backed by Jaebum clan,
which holds the most power.

17:39.309 --> 17:43.063
So it's between these two?

17:43.897 --> 17:48.777
Officially, #2 spot is
held by JANG Su-ki,

17:49.069 --> 17:54.282
but it's strictly a formality
and he's not involved in day-to-day.

17:54.991 --> 17:58.286
Can this be done?

17:59.704 --> 18:01.414
What if the it fails?

18:05.085 --> 18:08.505
It'll only cost their lives.

18:08.713 --> 18:12.217
Watch what you're saying!

18:17.722 --> 18:21.309
Alright, you have my blessing.

18:21.518 --> 18:25.772
- But keep me in the dark.
- Of course, sir.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.777
What's the operation
code name?

18:31.903 --> 18:35.698
New World, sir.
Operation New World.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.997
Dammit, there's nowhere to go.

18:43.498 --> 18:47.001
You haven't improved much
in 6 years.

18:47.585 --> 18:51.089
You know me,
I hate headaches.

18:54.926 --> 18:58.721
At least try to
make the most of it.

18:58.721 --> 18:59.722
For what?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.725
All this will be over soon.

19:04.519 --> 19:08.982
There's a succession
board meeting in <i>2</i> days,

19:08.982 --> 19:12.193
all the regional bosses
will attend it.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.697
Their profiles are in the report.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.908
Okay, I'll check.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.495
By the way,
this won't...

19:27.000 --> 19:29.419
affect me
or change our deal, right?

19:31.796 --> 19:33.006
Actually,

19:33.298 --> 19:35.592
got a new order
for you today.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.896
Have you lost it?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.982
You got a handler
for a reason.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.904
Why don't you go around
waving your badge?

20:38.404 --> 20:41.783
What is it this time?
What the hell's going on?

20:42.700 --> 20:47.080
You said I'm done
when SEOK's taken care of!

20:47.080 --> 20:49.499
- The situation's changed...
- 'Changed'?!

20:51.584 --> 20:53.795
Is it my fault
he wasn't prosecuted?

20:53.795 --> 20:56.214
Or that he's dead?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.424
Whose idea was this?

20:59.425 --> 21:01.719
Which fat head
came up with it?

21:01.719 --> 21:05.723
There's only 3 people in the world
who know about you.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.226
Was it you or director KO?

21:09.102 --> 21:11.271
You insolent fuck,

21:12.272 --> 21:14.274
watch your tone!

21:15.692 --> 21:19.487
After posing to be
a gangster for 10 years,

21:19.779 --> 21:21.781
you sound like the real thing.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.289
I can't do this anymore,

21:30.915 --> 21:32.292
keep your word.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.794
Yeah?

21:36.212 --> 21:37.505
That's right.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.427
Fine then don't.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.096
And just quit.

21:46.597 --> 21:49.225
You're good at
being a gangster.

21:50.018 --> 21:54.188
Give up the law
and be a gangster for real.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.985
Isn't that
a better life for you?

21:59.569 --> 22:03.406
Cop salary is rat shit.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.910
What's your income now?
A fortune, right?

22:07.910 --> 22:10.496
- Are your serious?
- Wait a minute.

22:11.998 --> 22:17.795
What'd they do to you
if they found out you're a cop?

22:21.424 --> 22:24.927
Is this fun to you?
Are you fucking with me?

22:28.598 --> 22:32.226
Look at you,
you're a bonafide gangster.

22:34.896 --> 22:36.064
Let go.

22:47.909 --> 22:49.410
Ungrateful prick.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.926
Look at the positive side of this,

23:05.718 --> 23:07.804
it'll only take a few weeks.

23:08.221 --> 23:11.307
You did this for 8 years,
this is nothing.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.936
Until the successor is decided.

23:16.479 --> 23:22.402
Continue supporting your boy JUNG,
it's no big deal.

23:23.486 --> 23:28.491
And I'll get you the promised
overseas reassignment.

23:29.283 --> 23:33.913
This special op will
double your pay.

23:34.205 --> 23:37.083
You'll practically be
a made man.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.294
Take this with you.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.510
I picked out a mobile
and some toys.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.595
I heard it's a son.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.063
How did you know that?

24:01.274 --> 24:03.568
You got a tail on me?

24:03.568 --> 24:08.197
Don't get paranoid,
we're just protecting our asset.

24:10.575 --> 24:13.286
You're our
most prized investment.

24:36.309 --> 24:37.602
Shit...

24:49.405 --> 24:53.201
It's not safe to delay
appointing the successor.

24:54.994 --> 24:59.081
We'd prefer to
appoint one ASAP.

24:59.081 --> 25:06.506
No organization can maintain stability
when the head's been chopped off.

25:07.006 --> 25:12.303
We got business in the works
and if we don't attend to them,

25:12.303 --> 25:16.015
people will start to get
funny ideas.

25:16.807 --> 25:20.937
It'll get ugly real fast.

25:21.687 --> 25:27.693
Then let's call a board meeting
this month and vote.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.284
Any thoughts?

25:36.494 --> 25:40.206
I agree with you all.

25:42.792 --> 25:43.793
What about you?

25:44.001 --> 25:46.504
There's no reason to object.

25:47.213 --> 25:50.591
It's not good to keep
that seat empty too long.

25:53.594 --> 25:57.306
Okay, it's settled then,

25:58.224 --> 26:00.226
we'll call
a board meeting next week

26:00.226 --> 26:03.187
and appoint a successor.

26:04.188 --> 26:07.775
If there's nothing else,
I'll head out.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.279
Got business to attend to.

26:11.779 --> 26:12.989
Yo.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.493
Since we're all here,
let's grab a bite.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.078
Forget it.

26:19.704 --> 26:23.583
I got no time for
bullshit pleasantries over a meal,

26:24.500 --> 26:26.502
especially with you.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.922
I'd rather choke to death.

26:31.215 --> 26:36.012
Shit, those are some choice words.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.098
I'm off then.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.485
Hemorrhaging asshole.

27:05.791 --> 27:11.505
Senile old fucks,
rolling their eyes and shit.

27:12.423 --> 27:15.009
Fucking eunuchs.

27:15.926 --> 27:22.433
Oh yeah, bro,
I have a big favor to ask you.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.226
I'm not interested.

27:25.019 --> 27:27.063
You cold bastard.

27:29.774 --> 27:34.904
I have to get back
to Shanghai in <i>2</i> clays.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.906
Couldn't finish the deal

27:36.906 --> 27:40.409
because the old man
got himself killed.

27:40.409 --> 27:44.705
It'll only take a few days,
look after my office for me.

27:45.706 --> 27:46.916
Alright.

27:48.084 --> 27:52.505
Fuck, you scared me,
lighten up.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.300
Go fuck yourself, little bitch.

27:58.511 --> 28:05.101
If Joong-gu knew I left my nest empty,
he might stir shit up,

28:05.101 --> 28:07.436
so keep it to yourself.

28:07.436 --> 28:10.481
He's not going through puberty,
he won't do anything.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.900
There're too many eyes
right now.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.778
That fucker is a walking puberty.

28:16.779 --> 28:20.408
Where's the car?
Didn't I tell you to park close?!

28:24.495 --> 28:25.788
What the fuck?

28:34.213 --> 28:35.423
Did I scare you?

28:36.799 --> 28:38.092
Got a jolt?

28:38.092 --> 28:40.511
Look, this isn't funny!

28:40.511 --> 28:42.221
I'm sorry.

28:43.723 --> 28:45.516
You piece of shit,
drive properly!

28:45.933 --> 28:48.436
Our colleagues had heart attacks.

28:48.436 --> 28:49.895
My apologies, boss.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.773
How the fuck
did you get a license?

28:53.899 --> 28:56.902
I thought you had
important business.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.282
Forgot the way out?
Need a map?

29:02.992 --> 29:05.911
You need to work on
your sense of humor.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.081
Take care, you hear?

29:09.915 --> 29:11.208
Take care.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.517
See that?
You see what I mean?

29:28.517 --> 29:31.061
That prick won't change
until he's buried.

29:32.188 --> 29:34.398
Shit, I think I pissed a little.

29:34.398 --> 29:35.691
Yo bro!

29:37.777 --> 29:39.779
That was nice.

29:41.489 --> 29:44.700
Damn, my heart's pounding!

29:44.700 --> 29:48.287
Let's go get some pussy,
or get shitfaced with pussies.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.789
I'm fine, you go ahead.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.081
- Shit.
- Go on.

29:51.081 --> 29:56.587
I don't enjoy fucking those virgins,
I just wanna calm my nerves.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.714
- In-out, in-out.
- Go on, drive.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.591
Come on, hop in.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.593
I really can't today.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.011
Get in!

30:07.598 --> 30:09.016
Follow us.

30:18.192 --> 30:22.780
Yo bro, something on your mind?

30:23.197 --> 30:24.698
You look like shit.

30:27.493 --> 30:31.288
I'm just... tired lately.

30:31.914 --> 30:35.793
We got important shit coming up,
you need to shape up.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.504
I'll get you some ginseng meds.

30:40.297 --> 30:44.802
I thought your face couldn't
get any uglier, but I guess not.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.598
Hello?

30:51.308 --> 30:55.062
I don't need a loan,
I'm rich.

30:58.983 --> 31:00.901
I pray to God,

31:00.901 --> 31:04.905
I hope your child
takes after your wife.

31:12.913 --> 31:17.418
We have to play the hand
we're dealt,

31:18.294 --> 31:20.212
it'll all work out for the best.

31:22.423 --> 31:26.427
You just follow my lead
like a sheep.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.598
Funny shit, huh?

31:31.807 --> 31:36.896
My chink brothers!
Fill your glasses!

31:43.903 --> 31:46.697
<i>Raise your glasses!
Let's drink to his unborn child!</i>

31:46.697 --> 31:52.286
<i>Let's all pray,
please take after his wife!</i>

31:52.786 --> 31:56.498
<i>You speak the truth!</i>

31:57.917 --> 32:00.294
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

32:04.506 --> 32:06.425
- Lemme pour for you.
- Yes, sir!

32:06.425 --> 32:09.011
Sit down, asswipe,
with the big cup.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.603
Will you stop
messing with the leaf?

32:20.064 --> 32:21.899
They got feelings too.

32:31.992 --> 32:34.411
How are other clans reacting?

32:35.412 --> 32:41.001
Them? They're busy figuring out
who to side with.

32:41.001 --> 32:46.006
Indeed, this will determine
if they'll live or not.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.219
How's Ja-sung?

32:51.595 --> 32:53.305
Heard he's got a kid
on the way.

32:54.098 --> 32:55.432
How's he coping?

32:57.226 --> 33:01.188
Of course not,
would you be?

33:04.566 --> 33:06.568
But what can he do?

33:08.195 --> 33:09.780
He has no say.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.282
Keep a tight leash on him,

33:12.282 --> 33:16.996
we can't lose control of him
at this point...

33:16.996 --> 33:18.580
I know, I know.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.711
The plan's good.

33:29.216 --> 33:33.095
Alright, proceed as written here,

33:34.513 --> 33:35.931
do this right.

33:58.579 --> 33:59.788
My boss...

34:01.290 --> 34:02.499
I mean...

34:04.918 --> 34:08.589
I uploaded LEE Joong-gu's file
that JUNG Chung had.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.426
That won't be enough
to charge him.

34:12.592 --> 34:16.722
It should be enough.
We'll take care of it.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.434
Who's the other snitch?

34:24.063 --> 34:25.688
Is he a cop too?

34:27.274 --> 34:28.984
Or intelligence?

34:30.069 --> 34:33.405
I'm not in the loop
on this intel either.

34:40.913 --> 34:43.206
What's the grand plan?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.293
There must be one by now.

34:50.797 --> 34:55.094
Can't even tell me that?
Shut up and do what I'm told?

35:00.432 --> 35:02.226
What am I to you all?

35:04.686 --> 35:08.690
Even those scumbags trust me,
why can't my own guys?

35:08.690 --> 35:11.068
I follow all your orders!

35:11.902 --> 35:14.404
As per protocol...
Fuck that!

35:23.205 --> 35:24.790
Fuck your protocols!

35:28.919 --> 35:31.296
My neck is on the line here.

35:34.591 --> 35:38.929
I'm a cop too,
we're on the same side, right?

36:01.577 --> 36:06.999
JUNG'S flying out
tomorrow afternoon,

36:07.791 --> 36:09.918
check the itinerary.

36:43.994 --> 36:45.412
Nice shot.

36:50.083 --> 36:55.005
- Nice shot.
- Great form.

37:05.015 --> 37:09.895
Do you all get to
hit the green nowadays?

37:10.270 --> 37:15.275
Usually, but not so much
these days.

37:15.567 --> 37:21.198
You know how
unhinged things are now...

37:21.198 --> 37:25.494
With the chairman's passing
and everything.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.496
Goddammit.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.500
Was that for me to hear?

37:32.292 --> 37:36.296
No, no, of course not.

37:36.296 --> 37:42.010
Why'd we pick a fight with you?
Of course not.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.931
We're family,
no need to get all worked up.

37:45.931 --> 37:50.769
Family? So how do you explain
your behavior then?

37:52.479 --> 37:58.277
Abandoning one of your own
and sucking up to JUNG.

37:59.569 --> 38:00.904
Didn't you?

38:01.571 --> 38:02.990
Or you?

38:04.283 --> 38:05.575
Who was it?

38:05.575 --> 38:09.997
Joong-gu, listen to me.

38:09.997 --> 38:17.004
You got it all wrong.
We couldn't possibly have done that.

38:17.421 --> 38:22.426
We just accepted him
because the chairman adored him.

38:22.426 --> 38:25.804
We take care of our own.
That's right.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.932
That chink bastard is
not one of us.

38:28.932 --> 38:29.933
Right, right.

38:29.933 --> 38:33.770
So next week's pissing contest
is pointless then.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.274
JANG won't side with anyone,

38:37.274 --> 38:40.986
and JUNG's clan
doesn't have enough sway

38:40.986 --> 38:46.199
to overcome this family,
isn't that right?

38:46.199 --> 38:48.702
That's right.

38:52.205 --> 38:57.711
Everyone knows we got your back.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.089
That's the truth...

39:02.299 --> 39:04.593
- But...
- Something for you?

39:04.926 --> 39:06.803
Of course there is.

39:09.431 --> 39:11.016
You get to keep your head.

39:20.484 --> 39:24.780
Was the chairman's death
really an accident?

39:27.699 --> 39:29.910
I feel terrible about
leaving like this.

39:29.910 --> 39:33.205
Will you stop it?
Stop kissing my ass.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.707
It's because I feel
really bad about it.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.918
Why don't you just stay then?

39:37.918 --> 39:42.714
Gonna be like that?
Alright, I'll stop.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.510
In any case,
just make sure...

39:47.094 --> 39:50.097
Okay, okay, I'll stop,
you bastard.

40:03.693 --> 40:07.989
- Fine, fine!
- Okay, okay!

40:07.989 --> 40:11.284
I'll buy real shit this time,
not cheap knock-offs.

40:11.284 --> 40:16.415
Will you just go?!
Not like you're off to war.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.918
Is something really up?

40:19.918 --> 40:23.713
What's with the attitude lately?
I'm off to war, fuckhead!

40:25.799 --> 40:27.217
Good afternoon.

40:31.012 --> 40:32.305
Have a safe trip!

41:07.424 --> 41:11.094
What, you got
an appointment with me?

41:11.303 --> 41:14.222
Come with us,
you'll find out.

41:16.016 --> 41:18.810
<i>I'm his lawyer.</i>

41:18.810 --> 41:20.562
<i>What's this about?
Go through me first.</i>

41:21.563 --> 41:22.981
What's he saying?

41:23.899 --> 41:25.567
Come with us quietly.

41:28.278 --> 41:29.905
Why not.

41:29.905 --> 41:33.074
But will you reimburse the ticket
if I miss the flight?

41:33.074 --> 41:34.784
Don't you worry.

41:36.203 --> 41:37.996
We fly first class.

41:38.288 --> 41:40.415
<i>National Police Agency</i>

41:51.718 --> 41:54.513
I've been really busy
with work,

41:55.096 --> 41:59.601
so what exactly is
the purpose of our chat?

42:04.189 --> 42:07.567
It's because of
that work of yours.

42:12.572 --> 42:14.574
<i>Goldmoon Corruption
Investigation Report</i>

42:44.771 --> 42:47.774
This is pretty serious stuff,
right here.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.569
Make a decision.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.779
There's still time
before your flight.

42:54.573 --> 42:56.283
I'm gonna smoke.

43:08.795 --> 43:12.924
So you want to
take care of Joong-gu,

43:14.426 --> 43:17.304
in other words,
you'll back me up?

43:17.304 --> 43:22.934
Right, as you know, you got
no chance against him.

43:25.478 --> 43:28.773
Thanks for seeing me
in a good light,

43:29.482 --> 43:33.403
but we're not
playground bullies.

43:33.403 --> 43:35.572
And we're not mall cops.

43:35.572 --> 43:39.492
- You're underestimating us.
- Your words, not mine.

43:50.295 --> 43:56.301
Are you really asking for
something to prosecute him?

43:56.926 --> 44:02.599
We don't always see eye to eye,
but this is pretty low.

44:05.226 --> 44:07.270
Read it on your flight.

44:19.699 --> 44:25.205
This looks like our own stuff.

44:26.206 --> 44:30.710
Fuck, I thought we smoked out
all the moles.

44:31.795 --> 44:34.214
Looks like there's more left.

44:35.090 --> 44:37.926
Let's get one thing straight.

44:38.301 --> 44:42.305
You accused SEOK's men
as moles and eliminated them.

44:42.722 --> 44:45.809
And SEOK was a necessary casualty
on your way to the throne.

44:48.687 --> 44:49.896
Right?

44:54.901 --> 44:57.278
Make of that what you will.

44:59.280 --> 45:04.285
If you collected this much dirt,
can't you do whatever you want?

45:04.285 --> 45:06.287
It's for everyone's good.

45:06.913 --> 45:10.709
We're asking for consent
before the shit hits the fan.

45:11.501 --> 45:14.796
Consent?
More like a notice.

45:15.296 --> 45:18.216
Enough for today,
you're late for your flight.

45:26.015 --> 45:30.979
By the way, how did you know
I was flying out today?

45:31.271 --> 45:33.481
And perfect timing too.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.570
Now it all makes sense.

45:39.696 --> 45:44.075
You got plenty of rats inside.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.203
Must be nice.

45:58.798 --> 46:00.425
<i>Look into him.</i>

46:00.425 --> 46:05.305
<i>Any dirt in his official police
records to personal details.</i>

46:05.305 --> 46:06.931
<i>Money is no object,</i>

46:08.433 --> 46:12.979
<i>get the best people on it.</i>

46:16.900 --> 46:19.486
<i>I know just the right
group for it.</i>

46:21.905 --> 46:23.782
<i>And...</i>

46:25.200 --> 46:30.789
<i>call the Yanbian hobos.</i>

46:32.290 --> 46:35.502
<i>Will you handle this yourself?</i>

46:44.093 --> 46:46.095
<i>Fucker...</i>

46:46.930 --> 46:50.517
so he wants to play?

46:51.226 --> 46:54.979
Yeah, are you on Joong-gu?

46:57.482 --> 46:59.400
Good boy.

47:00.193 --> 47:03.905
We're moving in first thing tomorrow
so gather some muscle.

47:04.572 --> 47:06.574
Okay.

47:13.081 --> 47:15.416
How's that old geezer JANG?

47:16.209 --> 47:22.006
What can a feeble chump do?
He just leads a lonely life.

47:22.298 --> 47:26.803
Aside from other geezers
dropping by for tea, nothing, boss.

47:27.929 --> 47:29.806
Tea won't class them up.

47:31.516 --> 47:35.478
Stay on those senile pricks
until the board meeting.

47:36.062 --> 47:38.398
Those eunuchs can't be trusted.

47:38.398 --> 47:40.567
- Don't worry, boss.
- Yes, boss.

47:41.067 --> 47:44.070
If one of them tries to
step out of the line...

47:45.488 --> 47:48.908
I'll chop their balls off
and feed them to their kids.

47:51.286 --> 47:54.706
Shit, you fucking scare me!

47:55.206 --> 47:58.793
You never did learn
the art of subtlety and elegance.

47:59.419 --> 48:03.089
'Chopping balls off',
listen to this guy.

48:05.008 --> 48:08.094
By the way, boss,
what about JUNG Chung?

48:08.720 --> 48:12.098
When you take the chair,
he'll dust up a storm.

48:15.018 --> 48:20.189
Enough business talk,
let's savor this meal.

48:20.189 --> 48:24.986
Veal here is so tender,
and it's real Korean beef.

48:24.986 --> 48:26.696
Yes, boss.

48:33.411 --> 48:35.413
- Who the fuck are you?
- Grab him.

48:38.207 --> 48:40.293
Who let them in!

48:40.293 --> 48:43.713
It's alright, sit, sit.

48:49.010 --> 48:52.597
Who the hell are you?

48:52.597 --> 48:56.726
Why are you ruining
a perfectly fine breakfast for us?

48:56.809 --> 48:59.687
Can't you see
we're eating here?

48:59.687 --> 49:02.899
It looks like
you're almost done.

49:06.778 --> 49:10.198
Well, I'll be damned,
it's lieutenant...

49:11.282 --> 49:13.076
Right, you got promoted.

49:13.493 --> 49:16.788
Chief KANG,
our paths cross too much.

49:18.081 --> 49:20.291
You piece of shit.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.503
I'm getting tired of
your mouth.

49:23.503 --> 49:28.591
This restaurant is
a bit out of your league.

49:28.591 --> 49:32.428
Your salary won't even
cover the dessert.

49:32.804 --> 49:36.307
Well, look at this...

49:37.100 --> 49:40.770
how can you eat this
in the morning?

49:41.479 --> 49:44.482
Know your place in life.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.567
Chief KANG...

49:50.279 --> 49:52.198
It's long, bear with me.

49:52.991 --> 50:00.581
LEE Joong-gu, you're charged with
murder, fraud, assault, extortion,

50:00.581 --> 50:05.211
and... yadda yadda yadda.

50:05.211 --> 50:07.422
So damn much.

50:07.797 --> 50:12.218
It's too early for
half-assed jokes.

50:12.218 --> 50:14.512
I'm not much of a joker.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.014
Are you really up for this?

50:16.514 --> 50:18.599
Think you can take me on?

50:19.726 --> 50:21.060
The charges won't stick.

50:21.394 --> 50:24.063
This is a court-certified warrant,

50:26.065 --> 50:30.403
we won't disappoint you
this time.

50:34.907 --> 50:35.783
Take him away.

50:38.578 --> 50:40.705
- Boss!
- Boss!

50:42.415 --> 50:46.085
Who was it,
was it that fucker JUNG?

50:48.588 --> 50:49.589
I wonder,

50:51.299 --> 50:52.592
who could it be?

50:55.219 --> 50:58.931
- !no!

51:22.914 --> 51:24.791
<i>Call a meeting.</i>

51:25.500 --> 51:29.003
<i>Okay, and I'll book
the ï¬‚ight back.</i>

51:32.590 --> 51:35.218
<i>ls the file on chief KANG
not ready yet?</i>

51:35.718 --> 51:39.597
<i>I made sure to have it for you
when we arrive.</i>

51:43.810 --> 51:45.186
<i>And the Yanbian hobos?</i>

51:48.272 --> 51:52.068
<i>They should've arrived by now.</i>

52:05.790 --> 52:08.209
<i>lncheon International
Ferry Terminal</i>

52:26.060 --> 52:28.896
Try not to look like hicks too much.

52:30.064 --> 52:31.482
No need to be so obvious.

52:33.192 --> 52:35.570
We don't need extra attention.

52:36.195 --> 52:38.197
- You hear?
- Okay.

52:39.907 --> 52:41.701
Let's get going!

52:48.207 --> 52:49.917
You see?!

52:51.210 --> 52:53.713
The Koreans sense these things!

52:54.213 --> 52:56.215
They already know
we're Yanbians!

53:00.428 --> 53:02.221
Let's go!

53:17.486 --> 53:24.911
This is the face,
fingers and toes.

53:25.203 --> 53:29.415
Hear his heartbeat?
He's healthy.

53:30.416 --> 53:34.003
You'll feel the baby kicking
from now on.

53:34.795 --> 53:38.591
You'll gain weight
noticeably and...

53:44.513 --> 53:45.932
Should we...

53:49.560 --> 53:51.270
live abroad?

54:06.202 --> 54:07.495
Hello?

54:22.426 --> 54:25.221
Haven't received
a report in weeks.

54:26.806 --> 54:28.808
<i>There was nothing special.</i>

54:29.600 --> 54:31.060
'Nothing special'?

54:31.477 --> 54:34.981
<i>And other times were special?</i>

54:35.398 --> 54:41.279
When does he get home,
what he eats, how much he eats,

54:41.279 --> 54:43.406
does he snore or not, that stuff,

54:43.406 --> 54:47.493
<i>I told you no detail is too small
to leave out.</i>

54:48.703 --> 54:52.415
ls your baby making you soft?

54:52.415 --> 54:54.208
Don't talk about my baby!

54:56.919 --> 55:00.506
I want to quit.

55:00.923 --> 55:03.926
Quit?

55:04.593 --> 55:11.225
You wanted this in exchange for
your dope fiend father.

55:12.226 --> 55:16.689
We pulled you out of that bar
and made you whole,

55:16.689 --> 55:19.275
shouldn't you be grateful?

55:19.275 --> 55:25.781
That dope fiend is dead, and
Ja-sung was the one who saved me.

55:26.198 --> 55:29.410
<i>Don't you worry,
I'll live for him.</i>

55:29.410 --> 55:30.703
Is that so?

55:33.706 --> 55:36.917
You think that's so easy?

55:37.084 --> 55:41.922
How would he feel if he knew
you're spying for us?

55:42.298 --> 55:46.093
That thug would love that,
won't he?

55:47.303 --> 55:49.096
Son of a bitch...

55:49.805 --> 55:55.561
Sure, but what can I do,
this is my job.

55:56.687 --> 56:01.484
Do yours right, got it?

56:23.589 --> 56:30.096
The cops really went
all out this time.

56:32.014 --> 56:38.771
Perhaps they really got
enough dirt to prosecute.

56:40.398 --> 56:41.565
Yeah?

56:42.775 --> 56:45.486
Then who provided the dirt?

56:47.488 --> 56:50.074
You think I did this?

56:51.409 --> 56:53.702
I don't stoop that low.

56:55.788 --> 56:59.083
And I never had
that kind of dirt.

56:59.083 --> 57:02.586
Is that so?
Then who could it be?

57:03.295 --> 57:07.591
If not you,
probably one of yours then.

57:09.593 --> 57:11.929
Your boy Ja-sung perhaps?

57:14.515 --> 57:19.186
Fucking traitor,
this is how you do me?

57:20.271 --> 57:25.484
Keep me busy and take over
the entire organization?

57:25.484 --> 57:27.987
- Yo, Joong-gu...
- Motherfucker!

57:27.987 --> 57:30.197
I'll fucking split your mouth!

57:47.506 --> 57:54.430
I'll fucking split your mouth,
if you ever say my name again.

57:56.599 --> 57:57.933
Try me.

58:00.478 --> 58:03.772
Come at me all you want,

58:04.273 --> 58:06.484
see if you get your way.

58:16.076 --> 58:19.205
Our lawyer's doing his best,

58:21.081 --> 58:22.917
so sit tight.

58:23.792 --> 58:27.796
We greased enough of them
over the years,

58:29.006 --> 58:30.591
it'll work out.

58:32.801 --> 58:34.220
Did you...

58:37.014 --> 58:38.516
offed the old man?

58:43.687 --> 58:45.564
It wasn't you?

58:47.775 --> 58:54.073
If not, it could've been
one of the moles, or...

58:54.073 --> 58:55.282
Or?

58:57.576 --> 59:00.079
A thousand others.

59:04.208 --> 59:06.710
Eat this, you fucking chink.

59:11.006 --> 59:12.508
Yo JUNG.

59:15.010 --> 59:16.303
Please...

59:18.013 --> 59:19.515
watch your back.

59:27.273 --> 59:31.986
Thank you for thinking of me,

59:33.696 --> 59:34.905
even behind bars.

59:36.991 --> 59:38.909
You're really something...

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:07.062
<i>Bring it.</i>

01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:23.078
It's a small token
of my appreciation.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:26.790
What is it,
something edible?

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:33.714
It's Chinese mooncake,
a real delicacy.

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:39.303
Mooncake, huh?

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:43.515
Come on, open it at home.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:48.562
How do you eat it?
Like this?

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.903
This doesn't look edible.

01:00:55.903 --> 01:01:00.074
It's laundered clean,
there's no need to worry.

01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:02.493
I'll take good care of you.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:07.081
We'll send you
a regular care package,

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.208
consider it your retirement fund.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:17.007
You just have to back off
and let us do our thing.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.219
Don't dig into
our affairs too much.

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:30.688
- Give me a smoke.
- Yes, boss.

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:42.282
What, don't like it?
Need some more?

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:45.077
Do you want a share
of our earnings then?

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:48.414
Hey JUNG Chung,

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:51.417
what do you take me for?

01:01:57.089 --> 01:01:58.590
Take it back.

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:03.095
I don't take money
from gangsters.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:09.560
Then what do you want?

01:02:09.977 --> 01:02:15.691
You're not trying to wipe us out,
so you must want something.

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:18.068
Wipe you out?

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:21.405
Someone else will
take your place in no time.

01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:26.702
And start a new investigation?
Too much hassle.

01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:30.289
We're not asking much
from you.

01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:35.210
Just know your place,
and do as you're told.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.796
No need to overreact
to everything.

01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:43.302
So you want us to run errands
for you clicks?

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:46.597
Like fucking ball-less lapdogs?

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.726
There's no need for that.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:52.895
Think of it as,

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:56.398
a cooperative relationship.

01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:59.193
- Grab the cash.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:12.790
Alright, enough,
go away!

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.212
Okay, I hear you.

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:22.216
I got your message
loud and clear,

01:03:23.926 --> 01:03:26.011
you'll hear from me soon.

01:03:53.205 --> 01:03:57.000
<i>It's chief KANG's personnel file,</i>

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.210
<i>both professional
and personal...</i>

01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:59.711
<i>Shut up!</i>

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:07.803
<i>Is this accurate?</i>

01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:11.807
<i>I got it from one of the best
Chinese hacker groups,</i>

01:04:11.807 --> 01:04:19.690
<i>These guys can infiltrate
the FBI database in 2 days tops.</i>

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:26.280
<i>And the Yanbian hobos?</i>

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.906
<i>They're standing by.</i>

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.293
<i>Incoming call - Bro</i>

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:50.304
My fucking bro!
Where you at?

01:04:50.304 --> 01:04:53.599
When did you get in?
Today?

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.893
Why didn't you call?

01:04:57.978 --> 01:04:59.479
Of course it's not a problem.

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:04.401
What surprise?

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:10.407
Why there?

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:16.204
Okay.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:23.003
Wasn't he due back in 2 days?

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:26.298
It's not like him.

01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:27.925
To the lncheon warehouse.

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:29.801
Yes, boss.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:35.515
Pull over.

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:45.484
<i>What would you like to do?</i>

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.577
<i>Call in the hobos.</i>

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:04.896
I think my cover is blown.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.774
Wipe my file
and clean this place.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:15.282
And please quit smoking.

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:17.909
Take care.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:50.567
She killed the lights?

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:27.270
Holy shit! You never said
she had a gun!

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.563
I wasn't told either,
fuckwad!

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:31.566
We still gotta keep her alive?

01:08:32.484 --> 01:08:35.487
- Yeah, that's the order.
- Let's hang back.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:41.701
It's a six-shooter,
she's got 3 bullets left.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:45.497
Hey retard!
This isn't Yanbian!

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:50.085
Didn't you hear the gunshots?!
The cops will be all over this shit!

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:53.921
Then what do we do?

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:56.716
Let's just blitz her!

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:58.510
Isn't that dangerous?

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.011
Are we on a vacation?

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:03.098
Let's move!

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:31.770
He's waiting inside, sir.

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.075
Why all the way here?

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:48.078
You're here,
a bit late though.

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:50.997
Yeah, because of the rain
and traffic.

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:55.585
Suk-mu, you fuck.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:11:00.215
I told you to buy
the newest GPS.

01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:04.010
You get realtime traffic info,
motherfucker.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.595
That's how we got here.

01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:10.433
Bring it.

01:11:13.395 --> 01:11:14.562
Come!

01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:34.207
Yo bro.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:51.433
Wanna see what's inside
that barrel?

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:00.567
Give me a smoke.

01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:35.894
Tada!

01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:42.901
It's your chess teacher.

01:12:44.778 --> 01:12:46.404
Surprised?

01:12:48.907 --> 01:12:52.911
Pretty cute
and a fuckable body too.

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:55.997
Those juicy tits...

01:12:57.082 --> 01:12:58.500
Yo bro.

01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:01.795
Did you know?

01:13:04.506 --> 01:13:07.926
That cunt is a spy.

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.720
A cop.

01:13:12.514 --> 01:13:14.432
She's a cop.

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:29.280
Did you know that?

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.284
No, I...

01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:37.580
I didn't.

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:45.797
She's a strong one,
that bitch.

01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:50.218
She won't talk
no matter what.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:56.599
She's better than my boys,
I'll give you that.

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:06.985
But I already knew
what I wanted to know,

01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:13.700
I figured
I'd confirm it with her.

01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:19.497
This right here.

01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:24.210
I paid a fortune in China
for this file.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.005
Check it out.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:38.933
Even I was shocked.

01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:46.274
Not just a mole, but a cop
was part of our family.

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:49.777
Go on, look.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:59.078
That cum stain beside her
is chief KANG,

01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:03.291
he's the one
barking up our asses.

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:14.511
He was an instructor
when she was at the Academy.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:19.098
So he was her mentor and shit.

01:15:19.933 --> 01:15:21.976
Probably popped her cherry.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.190
Read the next one.

01:15:27.899 --> 01:15:29.567
There's one more.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:38.910
That fucker there

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:42.080
really got me.

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:45.583
Son of a bitch!

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:47.919
Motherfucker!

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:05.895
Yo bro!

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.982
Shocked?

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:32.213
These fuck-holes were
playing you all this time.

01:16:35.425 --> 01:16:38.094
Shit, it's not cutting through!

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:57.905
Chief KANG'll get the message,
don't you think?

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:04.787
- Yo Yanbians!
- Yeah?

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:10.710
Have some fun
and toss her with the body.

01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:12.795
Okay.

01:17:13.713 --> 01:17:14.922
Let's go.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:24.807
When I'm through with you,
you'll beg me for death.

01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:31.082
What?
A booty call at this hour?

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:35.211
You're violating
my right to sleep.

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:41.718
Got some news
that'll wake you up.

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:43.511
This better be good.

01:18:43.511 --> 01:18:45.596
A new board meeting is called.

01:18:46.514 --> 01:18:48.599
In <i>2</i> days, 5 pm.

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:53.980
JUNG'll take the helm
since you're in here.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.695
So, you're here to
rub it in?

01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:02.780
Yeah, you useless
piece of shit.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.906
What the fuck?!

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:07.702
So useless that
you lost everything to the chinks.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:11.414
Since when did the chinks
take over Goldmoon?

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:14.792
Didn't it belong to your clan?

01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:17.795
You were the rightful heir.

01:19:20.298 --> 01:19:23.718
I didn't know you cared
so deeply for me.

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:27.221
And who got me into this?

01:19:27.597 --> 01:19:30.725
If it weren't for you,
this wouldn't have happened.

01:19:31.559 --> 01:19:34.771
Boy, we're cops.

01:19:35.188 --> 01:19:40.693
We get a report, we investigate,
we find dirt, we arrest.

01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:42.403
That's our job.

01:19:45.907 --> 01:19:50.286
So who made that report?

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:29.700
JUNG Chung,
you've hit rock bottom.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.001
So what?!

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:43.005
What do you want from me?
Grind my knife?

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.716
This is your best?!

01:20:45.716 --> 01:20:48.928
I'm LEE Joong-gu!
The almighty LEE Joong-gu!

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:05.296
JUNG Chung, that cocksucker.

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:11.510
This is rat poison,
no doubt about it.

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:13.596
Sir?

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:16.432
But I can't just let it pass.

01:22:19.477 --> 01:22:22.063
I can't sink alone.

01:22:22.897 --> 01:22:28.486
And this rat poison could be
a blessing in disguise.

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:39.205
Alright, I'll play along.

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.417
I'll play.

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:16.200
How did JUNG find out?

01:23:17.785 --> 01:23:22.915
Did you make a deal with him?

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:29.213
I know I'm a lowlife

01:23:31.716 --> 01:23:33.217
but not that low.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:40.725
I figured it was you.

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:44.270
I thought you flipped.

01:23:47.273 --> 01:23:49.191
We had a case like that.

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:54.196
A long time ago.

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:59.410
Is that why you had Suk-mu on me,
As an insurance?

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:05.499
We've put him there,
but he didn't know about you.

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:09.587
Son of a bitch.

01:24:09.587 --> 01:24:13.507
Don't be like that,
it's almost over.

01:24:13.507 --> 01:24:15.509
There's nothing more to lose.

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:23.059
Nothing's changed,

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:27.063
we continue
according to the plan.

01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:30.566
So what's the plan?

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:33.569
The plan?!

01:24:36.489 --> 01:24:40.284
Who will you back
between them?

01:24:40.493 --> 01:24:42.203
What?!

01:24:54.507 --> 01:24:58.219
JANG Su-ki, current vice chair
of Goldmoon.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.516
You said he holds no power.

01:25:03.933 --> 01:25:08.479
He was the Jeil boss,
but lost all power

01:25:08.479 --> 01:25:11.273
when the clans united
as Goldmoon.

01:25:11.565 --> 01:25:13.567
At the time,
Jeil was about to disband,

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:16.779
and he's semi-retired.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:18.906
So he's perfect for us.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:24.703
We took care of him
since the beginning so he's ripe,

01:25:24.995 --> 01:25:31.001
but he's so powerless that
our help alone won't do.

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:35.089
That's why he needs
a capable running mate.

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:37.091
A running mate?

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:39.510
This is Goldmoon's COO
LEE Ja-sung.

01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:41.929
He's from
the same town as JUNG,

01:25:41.929 --> 01:25:44.807
and also a Chinese descendant.

01:25:45.224 --> 01:25:47.268
Will he just comply?

01:25:48.185 --> 01:25:50.771
He may have to
betray JUNG later.

01:25:54.567 --> 01:25:58.988
I always wondered
who my running mate was.

01:26:00.197 --> 01:26:04.201
With you, this may be
a doable proposition.

01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:07.913
Ja-sung, let's go all the way.

01:26:08.289 --> 01:26:09.915
Son of a bitch!

01:26:12.585 --> 01:26:16.589
You two haven't
worked it all out yet?

01:26:20.593 --> 01:26:26.015
Ja-sung, let's talk details later.

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:34.565
What the fuck is this?!

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:39.486
Use him to
take over Goldmoon.

01:26:40.196 --> 01:26:41.780
You said this is the end,

01:26:43.407 --> 01:26:45.993
you said this was
my last mission.

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:48.495
Sir, I can't do this.

01:26:48.996 --> 01:26:53.292
You promised,
you gave me your word!

01:26:53.292 --> 01:26:55.502
Don't you care
what happens to me?

01:26:55.502 --> 01:26:57.004
Do I matter at all?

01:26:57.004 --> 01:26:58.797
There's no other choice.

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:04.220
This is the safest path
for you.

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.431
You son of a bitch!
Cut the bullshit!

01:27:10.267 --> 01:27:12.895
How do you think
JUNG Chung found out?

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:20.194
Our database was hacked
last week.

01:27:21.487 --> 01:27:23.405
By the Chinese hackers.

01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:28.702
They targeted me,
and stole top secret intel.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:29.995
They found Suk-mu, here too!

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:34.083
They got everything.

01:27:35.918 --> 01:27:41.090
And your file was
definitely included.

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:17.001
<i>How come you won't
kill Ja-sung?</i>

01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:26.593
Go over the Shanghai contract.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.272
I wiped all your files.

01:28:39.398 --> 01:28:44.778
Officer LEE Ja-sung does not exist.

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:53.787
Only me and the director
know about you.

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:58.584
No one knows why
JUNG decided to keep you.

01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:02.087
But It's a lucky break.

01:29:03.297 --> 01:29:06.592
It gave us the upper hand.

01:29:08.594 --> 01:29:11.096
JUNG Chung's finished,
as of today.

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:15.184
LEE's clan is on the move.

01:29:17.478 --> 01:29:18.896
Got a smoke?

01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:31.492
<i>What the?</i>

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:35.287
Shit!

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:38.415
Get him!
Motherfuckers!

01:29:47.591 --> 01:29:49.510
Hey! Take fucking JUNG Chung!

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:50.928
Motherfuckers!

01:29:50.928 --> 01:29:52.096
Take JUNG Chung!

01:29:57.768 --> 01:29:58.769
Motherfuckers!

01:30:09.196 --> 01:30:10.489
Block him out!

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:25.087
Motherfuckers!

01:30:28.298 --> 01:30:29.591
Boss, you have to go!

01:30:29.591 --> 01:30:31.718
Let go of me, assholes!

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:33.512
Send them to hell!

01:30:34.221 --> 01:30:36.223
Kill 'em all!
Motherfuckers!

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:37.433
Hey, take care of him.

01:30:38.267 --> 01:30:40.060
Hold them back!

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:43.188
Stop them!

01:30:45.983 --> 01:30:47.276
Hey, take care of him.

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:39.221
You spineless fucks...

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:42.391
Did Joong-gu order the hit?

01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:46.395
Falling for the cops' tricks?

01:32:46.395 --> 01:32:55.195
You underestimated our clan,
you backstabbing chink!

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:07.416
Come at me, motherfuckers!
Come at me!

01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:08.917
Do It!

01:34:28.789 --> 01:34:29.706
This way please.

01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:31.917
- Get some first aid...
- emergency service please!

01:34:31.917 --> 01:34:33.210
Move, move, move!

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:37.798
Over here, asshole!

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:33.478
Joong-gu, that fucker finally
stirred up a shitstorm.

01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:39.276
He dragged everyone
into this mess.

01:35:39.568 --> 01:35:43.280
Him and his clan's finished.

01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:48.785
There's no other way
around this now.

01:35:50.704 --> 01:35:55.000
Someone must step up and
clean up this mess.

01:35:56.585 --> 01:35:58.086
Isn't that right,
vice chair JANG?

01:36:21.067 --> 01:36:25.405
We tried our best
but he won't make it.

01:36:26.281 --> 01:36:27.908
I'm sorry.

01:36:47.093 --> 01:36:48.720
What do we do, boss?

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:19.000
<i>- Where's HAN Joo-kyung?
- She's...</i>

01:37:20.710 --> 01:37:22.504
She is in recovery.

01:37:24.089 --> 01:37:26.925
<i>I'm sorry about the baby.</i>

01:37:27.509 --> 01:37:33.014
<i>High levels of stress
and sudden shock triggered this.</i>

01:37:33.723 --> 01:37:36.893
<i>It'd have been
dangerous for her too.</i>

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.424
<i>Now, Ja-sung just has to
take over.</i>

01:38:07.924 --> 01:38:09.509
He's a made man now.

01:38:10.719 --> 01:38:13.013
Shouldn't he thank us for this?

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:27.903
When this is done,
process my resignation.

01:38:31.489 --> 01:38:36.411
Are you drunk?
Not that shit again.

01:38:37.787 --> 01:38:43.585
Who'll manage this operation
if you leave?

01:38:44.002 --> 01:38:46.504
You made this case,
this is your baby.

01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:51.426
I can't,
I'm too dumb for this shit.

01:38:54.512 --> 01:38:58.058
Stupidity is your excuse?
Fucking moron.

01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:02.979
Can't take it all back.

01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:11.571
No one can back out of this.

01:39:13.406 --> 01:39:17.202
Either we see it through,
Or die in the process,

01:39:17.202 --> 01:39:20.413
so there's no turning back.

01:39:22.916 --> 01:39:26.002
It's a goddamn shame
we lost a few of our own,

01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:29.798
some sacrifices are needed
to win a war.

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:40.976
Can you keep him on our leash?

01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:43.979
It won't be so easy anymore.

01:39:46.398 --> 01:39:51.277
What can he do?
He's a shrimp caught in our net.

01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:06.084
No, thanks.

01:40:07.794 --> 01:40:09.421
I quit.

01:40:19.514 --> 01:40:25.687
Who knew the passing of SEOK
would be such a blessing!

01:40:27.564 --> 01:40:28.773
Indeed!

01:40:29.566 --> 01:40:32.193
Now that it's all behind us,

01:40:32.569 --> 01:40:39.284
SEOK, and his boys LEE and JUNG
were way too uptight.

01:40:39.284 --> 01:40:41.578
It's a brand new era.

01:40:41.995 --> 01:40:47.083
Will JUNG's boys stay in line?

01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:50.712
They still got Ja-sung.

01:40:53.923 --> 01:40:56.217
Your worries are unfounded.

01:40:57.218 --> 01:41:03.391
I assure you,
they won't act reckless.

01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:11.274
I promised him the vice chair
once I become the chair.

01:41:12.692 --> 01:41:16.696
That's a brilliant idea!

01:41:17.197 --> 01:41:23.286
Succeeding in accordance
to the rank is the right thing.

01:41:23.286 --> 01:41:26.790
- This is great!
- Very good!

01:41:36.007 --> 01:41:41.721
As a precaution,
I brought my own men.

01:41:43.598 --> 01:41:48.061
Just enough muscle for
a smooth transition.

01:41:48.061 --> 01:41:52.273
Don't you worry,
I know where I stand.

01:41:53.274 --> 01:41:55.068
What can I do with a few men?

01:41:55.068 --> 01:41:59.072
Think of them
as my entourage.

01:42:02.492 --> 01:42:06.579
Let's finish this drink
and start swinging!

01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:19.425
I feel so terrible!

01:42:19.926 --> 01:42:23.304
Asking Goldmoon's vice chair
to this shobby joint.

01:42:25.098 --> 01:42:26.474
What do you want?

01:42:26.975 --> 01:42:28.393
What do I want?

01:42:29.894 --> 01:42:33.398
Remember you're at
my beck and call.

01:42:34.899 --> 01:42:38.695
Until another handler is assigned,
report directly to me.

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:44.909
I'm warning you,
nothing's changed.

01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:49.080
You're a cop,
don't forget.

01:42:51.291 --> 01:42:56.796
And submit a revised
organization chart by next week.

01:42:57.922 --> 01:43:02.218
Emphasize new intel that
you didn't have access to before.

01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:04.095
Got it?

01:43:05.305 --> 01:43:10.977
Especially the top brass, feds,
and other suits on Goldmoon's payroll.

01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:27.911
One more thing,

01:43:30.914 --> 01:43:33.791
LEE will be released soon.

01:43:35.084 --> 01:43:36.211
What?

01:43:36.211 --> 01:43:37.921
Insufficient evidence.

01:43:37.921 --> 01:43:41.299
Let me be clear,,
don't touch him.

01:43:47.597 --> 01:43:49.307
I'm sorry about your baby.

01:43:51.392 --> 01:43:52.769
I mean it.

01:44:37.063 --> 01:44:38.273
Yeah.

01:44:38.773 --> 01:44:39.983
What?

01:44:55.290 --> 01:44:57.000
It doesn't look good.

01:44:57.792 --> 01:45:01.087
You should make
necessary arrangements.

01:45:13.266 --> 01:45:15.685
Leave us.

01:45:18.563 --> 01:45:19.897
Let's go.

01:46:27.507 --> 01:46:30.093
Loosen up, you fuck.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.806
I'm not dead yet.

01:46:39.894 --> 01:46:42.772
Didn't think
I'd see you again,

01:46:45.483 --> 01:46:47.485
so good to see you.

01:46:51.781 --> 01:46:53.699
Yo bro.

01:46:57.412 --> 01:46:59.705
You look like shit.

01:47:07.922 --> 01:47:10.007
It's time...

01:47:14.512 --> 01:47:17.265
to choose a side.

01:47:23.062 --> 01:47:25.898
Listen to me, asshole.

01:47:30.069 --> 01:47:32.780
You'll stay alive that way.

01:47:56.721 --> 01:47:59.056
What are you doing?

01:48:00.266 --> 01:48:01.559
Boss!

01:48:04.770 --> 01:48:05.897
BIO!

01:48:06.063 --> 01:48:08.691
You fucking idiot...

01:48:15.573 --> 01:48:17.783
What if...

01:48:19.911 --> 01:48:22.413
like a fucking miracle,

01:48:24.207 --> 01:48:27.502
I pull through?

01:48:30.713 --> 01:48:35.593
Think you can take on me?

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:10.211
I left you a present
in my office safe.

01:49:13.798 --> 01:49:15.716
Check it out later.

01:49:22.306 --> 01:49:24.183
<i>Be strong,</i>

01:49:24.225 --> 01:49:27.770
<i>my brother.</i>

01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:35.403
<i>That's the only way
for you to survive.</i>

01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:43.202
Go away, I'm tired.

01:55:21.582 --> 01:55:23.417
I'll be damned...

01:55:24.919 --> 01:55:28.589
How low the almighty
has fallen.

01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:34.929
Yes boss, he just got out.

01:56:29.191 --> 01:56:33.570
Ride with me,
I want a word with you.

01:56:51.213 --> 01:56:55.926
Beautiful day, isn't it?

01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:30.419
He's a terrible driver.

01:58:28.685 --> 01:58:33.065
If you were me,
wouldn't you do the same?

01:58:35.567 --> 01:58:37.694
KANG won't let this slide.

01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:41.281
What can he do?

01:58:42.783 --> 01:58:47.704
With you gone,
he can only depend on me.

01:58:50.207 --> 01:58:53.293
Shall we?
Let's get some air.

01:59:09.476 --> 01:59:14.189
Take care, send my regards
to JUNG Chung.

01:59:57.482 --> 02:00:02.404
Give me a smoke
if you got one.

02:00:17.586 --> 02:00:22.007
One last smoke isn't much
to ask for, right?

02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:46.490
Today's the board meeting?

02:00:52.579 --> 02:00:57.793
Congratulate Ja-sung for me,
who knew he'd sit on the throne.

02:00:58.710 --> 02:00:59.920
Rags to riches...

02:01:12.474 --> 02:01:17.688
What a beautiful clay to die.

02:01:38.792 --> 02:01:41.712
How dare you?!

02:02:43.398 --> 02:02:45.984
What a twist.

02:02:50.572 --> 02:02:53.992
Hey, mister,
you really have cab fare?

02:02:55.494 --> 02:02:56.912
Dammit!

02:02:57.412 --> 02:03:00.582
Fine, fine, don't touch!

02:03:00.582 --> 02:03:02.292
Which car? That one?

02:03:35.075 --> 02:03:37.202
Attention please.

02:03:37.911 --> 02:03:44.209
<i>Our current vice chair and
unanimous successor JANG Su-ki</i>

02:03:44.918 --> 02:03:53.427

02:04:15.782 --> 02:04:19.995

nominated for the chair.

02:04:20.996 --> 02:04:23.290
<i>Any objections?</i>

02:04:51.902 --> 02:04:53.570
It's done, sir.

02:05:17.928 --> 02:05:22.766
This is an expensive car,
it's not for your...

02:05:24.893 --> 02:05:27.979
Mister, pull up right beside it.

02:05:28.772 --> 02:05:30.065
What, what?

02:05:31.274 --> 02:05:34.986
Are you deaf?
Beside that car.

02:05:34.986 --> 02:05:36.196
Oh, okay...

02:06:58.194 --> 02:07:04.576
<i>Chairman LEE Ja-sung</i>

02:07:21.217 --> 02:07:22.594

Chinese descendant, right?

02:07:41.488 --> 02:07:42.697
Yes, sir.

02:07:55.794 --> 02:08:01.216
I got a job for you,
one that's tailored for you.

02:08:04.719 --> 02:08:05.929
Sir?

02:09:32.474 --> 02:09:35.560
<i>6 years ago, Yeosu</i>

02:09:45.069 --> 02:09:46.780
Come on, hurry up!

02:09:47.697 --> 02:09:50.992
Fuck, I gotta piss
when I get nervous.

02:09:50.992 --> 02:09:52.410
You drank like a whore.

02:10:00.293 --> 02:10:02.212
- I'll be right back.
- Goddammit!

02:10:08.718 --> 02:10:10.303
Shit, I got it on my pants.

02:10:15.767 --> 02:10:18.394
- Any plans later?
- What do you think?

02:10:21.898 --> 02:10:24.692
What the fuck?!

02:10:26.986 --> 02:10:28.488
There's too many of 'em.

02:10:29.489 --> 02:10:32.700
Who the fuck?!

02:10:32.992 --> 02:10:35.912
I'll fucking kill you!

02:10:51.010 --> 02:10:52.220
Give me a smoke.

02:10:55.557 --> 02:10:59.269
Let's clean up
and go watch a movie.

02:11:00.770 --> 02:11:01.980
Which one?

02:11:02.689 --> 02:11:04.482
Porn, of course.

02:11:06.067 --> 02:11:07.569
Fuck...
