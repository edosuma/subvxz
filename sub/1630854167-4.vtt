00:10.267 --> 00:12.269
[tense music playing]

00:17.714 --> 00:20.597
I mean, he couldn't
have killed her, right?

00:22.599 --> 00:23.740
Right?

00:23.840 --> 00:25.842
[door opens and closes]

00:26.522 --> 00:28.524
[sighs]

00:29.245 --> 00:31.467
Morning, bud. What's going on?

00:31.567 --> 00:34.430
-It's Ponce de Leon Day.
-Oh. [chuckles]

00:34.530 --> 00:37.513
'Cause why wouldn't
Florida celebrate
a colonising murderer?

00:37.613 --> 00:39.996
He was looking
for a magical fountain.

00:40.096 --> 00:42.398
-Hmm.
-But he found Florida instead.

00:42.498 --> 00:44.760
-Wow, how lucky are we!
-[cell phone ringing]

00:44.860 --> 00:46.862
[chuckles]

00:50.105 --> 00:52.107
Why don't you go get your stuff
for school, okay?

00:54.229 --> 00:55.731
Hey, there.

00:55.831 --> 00:57.853
I have a new strategy,

00:57.953 --> 00:59.455
but I need you here
as soon as you can.

00:59.555 --> 01:01.216
Yeah, that's not gonna--

01:01.316 --> 01:03.659
Well, come by as soon
as you're done handing out
tickets or seducing men.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.821
-I don't think that's gonna--
-Or is it generally both
at the same time?

01:05.921 --> 01:07.142
Bell, are you listening to me?

01:07.242 --> 01:09.244
Oh, and, Cammie, um...

01:09.644 --> 01:11.666
thank you.

01:11.766 --> 01:14.870
I feel better, much better.

01:14.970 --> 01:18.153
Must go. Checotah's here
with the compression socks
and the Theragun.

01:18.253 --> 01:19.034
The what?

01:19.134 --> 01:21.136
[quirky music playing]

01:24.098 --> 01:26.100
[sighs]

01:33.307 --> 01:35.309
-[panting]
-[beeps]

01:37.151 --> 01:39.694
Are you sure you're okay, man?

01:39.794 --> 01:41.095
You look like you're
gonna have a heart attack.

01:41.195 --> 01:43.197
[exhales deeply]
I always look like that.

01:44.318 --> 01:45.820
Just do it.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.421
[mumbles]

01:47.521 --> 01:49.523
[blows whistle]

02:03.096 --> 02:05.098
Oh, hello.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.403
You like what I've done
with the place?

02:09.503 --> 02:11.044
Not particularly.

02:11.144 --> 02:13.146
Well, leave.

02:18.792 --> 02:20.453
Bell Prescott keeps calling.

02:20.553 --> 02:22.555
He wants to know
when you're coming over.

02:22.996 --> 02:24.998
Are you two a-courtin'?

02:25.838 --> 02:29.142
No, Urleen,
we are not a-courtin'.

02:29.242 --> 02:31.244
He's kind of cute.

02:33.406 --> 02:35.708
Like a boy and an old man
all mixed up together.

02:35.808 --> 02:37.810
Uh... how is that cute?

02:38.931 --> 02:40.933
Just tell him I'm busy.

02:41.334 --> 02:43.115
I could tell him
you're out writing tickets.

02:43.215 --> 02:45.638
Actually, I should be out
writing tickets.

02:45.738 --> 02:47.940
So, tickets it is!

02:50.462 --> 02:52.464
[rock music playing]

02:57.389 --> 02:59.391
[Cammie sighs]

03:00.792 --> 03:02.834
Tickets, it is not.

03:07.759 --> 03:09.581
This is murder.

03:09.681 --> 03:11.103
[handcuffs clicking]

03:11.203 --> 03:13.785
Tien Tran,

03:13.885 --> 03:15.947
you are under arrest
for the murder of Maxie Tran.

03:16.047 --> 03:17.949
Anything you say
can and will...

03:18.049 --> 03:21.072
blah, blah, blah.

03:21.172 --> 03:23.795
That poor woman trusted you.
She befriended you.

03:23.895 --> 03:25.196
She shared
her damn husband with you!

03:25.296 --> 03:26.277
And what'd she get?

03:26.377 --> 03:28.880
Blown up
in an illegal fireworks stand.

03:28.980 --> 03:30.521
I mean, what kind of
backwoods shit is that?

03:30.621 --> 03:32.623
[scoffs] But you know what?

03:34.025 --> 03:35.566
That happens to all of us.

03:35.666 --> 03:37.668
We get played, Tien.

03:38.069 --> 03:40.211
[chuckles] God, we get played.

03:40.311 --> 03:42.533
I mean, off I go,
trusting someone again,

03:42.633 --> 03:44.735
and then
it just blows up in my face,

03:44.835 --> 03:47.018
because it turns out, unless
there's a better explanation...

03:47.118 --> 03:50.301
oh! They murdered their wife!

03:50.401 --> 03:51.582
That seem fair to you?

03:51.682 --> 03:54.865
[speaking Vietnamese]

03:54.965 --> 03:55.826
[in English] Bitch.

03:55.926 --> 03:58.409
Thank you. Thank you. I, um...

04:00.010 --> 04:02.012
I feel better. [sighs]

04:03.133 --> 04:04.755
What?

04:04.855 --> 04:06.857
[indistinct chatter]

04:10.660 --> 04:12.662
[lock clicking]

04:17.027 --> 04:19.029
I'd like to file a report.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.811
Dog poop on your lawn

04:21.911 --> 04:23.953
or a reptile
in your washing machine?

04:27.036 --> 04:30.660
Bellwether Prescott conspired
with an officer of the law

04:30.760 --> 04:33.022
to move
my daughter's burial site,

04:33.122 --> 04:35.124
and that officer is you.

04:37.567 --> 04:39.569
Mrs. Perez.

04:39.889 --> 04:41.891
Officer Lorde.

04:44.333 --> 04:47.056
Mr. Prescott acted
within his rights
as a surviving spouse.

04:49.338 --> 04:51.881
If you interfere
in my family again,

04:51.981 --> 04:53.983
there will be consequences.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.166
Unless you really want
to file that report,

04:57.266 --> 04:59.268
I have a very busy day.

05:00.669 --> 05:02.671
Fine.

05:03.111 --> 05:06.315
I'll be paying
my feckless stain
of a son-in-law a visit.

05:08.797 --> 05:10.459
Mrs. Perez.

05:10.559 --> 05:12.561
Sheriff.

05:13.361 --> 05:15.464
She's all yours.

05:15.564 --> 05:19.227
Explain to me what part
of digging up Vida Perez

05:19.327 --> 05:21.109
is you staying away from a case

05:21.209 --> 05:23.691
I expressly told you
to stay away from.

05:25.293 --> 05:27.315
I caught a killer manicurist.

05:27.415 --> 05:29.397
-You must be happy about that.
-Look, I get it.

05:29.497 --> 05:32.520
You want to do right,
but I grew up here.

05:32.620 --> 05:36.444
I know these people,
and Bell Prescott is bad news.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.487
Look, all I'm saying, Lorde,

05:39.587 --> 05:43.050
is that you've got to learn
how to ask questions

05:43.150 --> 05:45.312
before you pretend
to have answers.

05:46.914 --> 05:50.057
Out of curiosity,
you ever question him
about his wife's murder?

05:50.157 --> 05:52.159
Of course I did.

05:53.761 --> 05:55.342
Look, it's...

05:55.442 --> 05:58.105
it's possible there--
there's something
you should know.

05:58.205 --> 06:00.207
And what exactly is that?

06:02.930 --> 06:05.873
If you got something, tell me.

06:05.973 --> 06:07.974
[tense music playing]

06:08.815 --> 06:10.957
No, sir. I've got nothing.

06:11.057 --> 06:12.879
[keys jingle]

06:12.979 --> 06:14.721
I appreciate the advice.

06:14.821 --> 06:16.163
All right.
Well, thanks for this.

06:16.263 --> 06:18.264
Good work.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.051
[speaking Vietnamese]

06:25.151 --> 06:26.493
[in English] Ticket lady.

06:26.593 --> 06:28.134
[Sheriff Grant chuckles]

06:28.234 --> 06:30.657
She just called you
a fucking bitch, ticket lady.

06:30.757 --> 06:31.698
[chuckles]

06:31.798 --> 06:33.800
[tense music playing]

06:35.161 --> 06:37.163
[theme music playing]

06:42.368 --> 06:44.911
I thought you wanted a break,
but here I am.

06:45.011 --> 06:46.232
Just can't let go.

06:46.332 --> 06:48.714
And you've already looked
at those a thousand times.

06:48.814 --> 06:50.716
Actually, 232.

06:50.816 --> 06:54.079
"Secrets and Lies,
Incorporated, Miami, Florida."

06:54.179 --> 06:57.162
Lingerie store.
You've literally eaten
their underwear off me.

06:57.262 --> 06:58.764
What are you hiding, Vida?

06:58.864 --> 07:01.567
[sighs] Isn't it better to just
remember the good times?

07:01.667 --> 07:03.489
Our first night at Shucks?

07:03.589 --> 07:05.130
We made out in the corner.

07:05.230 --> 07:06.852
You bought me dinner at Shucks

07:06.952 --> 07:10.015
to commemorate
the third anniversary
of the first time we had sex.

07:10.115 --> 07:13.298
Yes, that is another memory.

07:13.398 --> 07:14.579
It was a month
before your murder,

07:14.679 --> 07:16.221
but there's no charge
on your credit card.

07:16.321 --> 07:18.323
You didn't use cash,
so how did you pay?

07:19.444 --> 07:20.625
Who knows?

07:20.725 --> 07:21.906
And who cares?

07:22.006 --> 07:24.008
[suspenseful music playing]

07:25.330 --> 07:27.152
You had a secret credit card.

07:27.252 --> 07:29.154
[Vida] I couldn't
have a secret card.

07:29.254 --> 07:30.315
You would have seen the bills.

07:30.415 --> 07:31.756
[Bell] Stop trying
to distract me.

07:31.856 --> 07:33.398
You're just a projection
of my mind

07:33.498 --> 07:35.840
to protect me
from further hurt.

07:35.940 --> 07:39.203
I could put you
in a mascot costume
to silence you if I wanted.

07:39.303 --> 07:41.005
[groans] This is ridiculous!

07:41.105 --> 07:42.366
Who cares
how I paid for a dinner?

07:42.466 --> 07:44.769
The husband
you cheated on cares.

07:44.869 --> 07:46.771
You wonder
why I strayed from this?

07:46.871 --> 07:48.873
I loved you, Vida...

07:49.513 --> 07:53.217
everything about you,
the good and the bad...

07:53.317 --> 07:55.419
the way you could never let
anyone else have the last word.

07:55.519 --> 07:57.141
It's called having an opinion.

07:57.241 --> 07:58.662
The way you forgot things,

07:58.762 --> 08:01.425
because there was always
someone else
to pick up the pieces.

08:01.525 --> 08:02.866
Jewellery at the pool.

08:02.966 --> 08:04.948
Bills that I asked you to mail.

08:05.048 --> 08:08.812
And how many lip glosses
went through the damn wash
and stained our clothes...

08:11.535 --> 08:13.357
Pink?

08:13.457 --> 08:15.559
[Vida] Carino, enough!

08:15.659 --> 08:17.661
These!

08:18.541 --> 08:20.543
[Vida groans]

08:20.864 --> 08:22.445
[suspenseful music playing]

08:22.545 --> 08:24.547
[sighs]

08:30.994 --> 08:32.996
Look at this.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.762
You were wearing this
that night at Shucks.

08:46.689 --> 08:50.272
Why did your father give you
a company credit card, Vida?

08:50.372 --> 08:53.135
Maybe he got tired of me
having to dig up money
in your backyard.

08:54.336 --> 08:56.338
[cell phone chimes]

08:57.700 --> 08:59.842
[gasps]

08:59.942 --> 09:01.123
What is it?

09:01.223 --> 09:03.225
[ominous music playing]

09:04.586 --> 09:06.728
Your mother...

09:06.828 --> 09:08.830
coming... here.

09:10.392 --> 09:11.253
Oh.

09:11.353 --> 09:13.515
I've known you for years, Bell.

09:14.516 --> 09:16.518
Tell me the truth.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.362
We had an argument.

09:21.042 --> 09:22.304
I told you that already.

09:22.404 --> 09:23.665
[Sheriff Grant] Tell me again.

09:23.765 --> 09:25.547
What was it about?

09:25.647 --> 09:27.108
[Bell] I don't know.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.210
I was drunk.

09:29.971 --> 09:31.152
You followed her, didn't you?

09:31.252 --> 09:33.254
No.

09:35.176 --> 09:37.078
I don't think...

09:37.178 --> 09:39.180
I can't remember.

09:40.381 --> 09:41.562
But I need to see her.

09:41.662 --> 09:43.364
Just as soon as you tell me

09:43.464 --> 09:45.466
what you were fighting about.

09:46.467 --> 09:47.528
[Bell sighs]

09:47.628 --> 09:49.630
[tense music playing]

09:51.472 --> 09:54.054
-It doesn't matter.
-It matters to me.

09:54.154 --> 09:56.737
No, no, no, no!

09:56.837 --> 09:58.539
[sobbing]

09:58.639 --> 10:00.641
-[footsteps]
-What you watching?

10:02.643 --> 10:03.984
What are you doing here,
Marcus?

10:04.084 --> 10:06.086
You've had time
to chew on this, Cam.

10:06.847 --> 10:08.749
I want to see my son.

10:08.849 --> 10:11.451
Have you noticed
that what you want
changes every five minutes?

10:13.013 --> 10:15.015
You're letting your issues
get in the way of my kid.

10:16.656 --> 10:18.658
Look, I'm just... I'm just
not comfortable with this.

10:19.659 --> 10:22.282
I'm sorry. I have work to do.

10:22.382 --> 10:23.883
Think about it, Cammie.

10:23.983 --> 10:25.005
Okay.

10:25.105 --> 10:27.106
-Please.
-Mm-hmm.

10:31.110 --> 10:32.932
Hey, Millicent. How's it going?

10:33.032 --> 10:35.034
[sighs] Mm-hmm.

10:36.075 --> 10:37.096
Whoa!

10:37.196 --> 10:39.298
What's... What's going on here?

10:39.398 --> 10:41.180
Why do you ask?

10:41.280 --> 10:42.782
We're de-"taxiderming"
the house.

10:42.882 --> 10:44.584
Well, some of us are.

10:44.684 --> 10:47.306
I wouldn't clean
for that woman,
and neither should you.

10:47.406 --> 10:49.408
-Cammie...
-[Millicent] Oh.

10:49.889 --> 10:51.831
Damn it.
Mother, hide that thing!

10:51.931 --> 10:54.954
I don't know why you care
what Alicia Perez thinks.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.795
I do not want to give her
the satisfaction

10:56.895 --> 10:59.118
of thinking her daughter
married a slovenly louche.

10:59.218 --> 11:00.359
Now, please, just help.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.201
[whimsical music playing]

11:02.301 --> 11:04.123
[Cammie] Wow.

11:04.223 --> 11:05.764
Are you...

11:05.864 --> 11:07.766
Are you wearing cologne?

11:07.866 --> 11:08.887
Yes.

11:08.987 --> 11:11.049
Well, it's Bay Rum.
It's more of a tonic, really.

11:11.149 --> 11:12.210
Oh.

11:12.310 --> 11:14.312
At any rate,
it's good you're finally here.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.975
Whatever secret life
Vida was hiding,

11:17.075 --> 11:19.938
this could be our in,
but I need your help.

11:20.038 --> 11:23.021
All you have to do
is call the card company
and get their statements

11:23.121 --> 11:24.582
so I can find out
what she was hiding.

11:24.682 --> 11:26.684
And commit a felony
by impersonating a dead woman.

11:27.765 --> 11:29.747
Think of it this way.
You're a cop.

11:29.847 --> 11:31.669
If we get caught,
you can just arrest yourself.

11:31.769 --> 11:34.352
[scoffs] Actually, what would
be more helpful here is

11:34.452 --> 11:35.954
if we talked about
the night of Vida's murder.

11:36.054 --> 11:38.836
Two words: blackout drunk.

11:38.936 --> 11:41.018
Is that two words?
Is "blackout" a word?

11:42.980 --> 11:44.161
It's one word.

11:44.261 --> 11:46.263
Point is, I remember nothing.

11:47.465 --> 11:50.067
You don't remember
there was a big storm
that night, trees fell.

11:51.709 --> 11:53.711
You don't remember
maybe picking something up...

11:55.673 --> 11:58.015
to chop away the branches?

11:58.115 --> 12:00.117
You make the call,
I'll answer your questions.
How's that?

12:04.521 --> 12:06.523
[recorded message
playing faintly on phone]

12:07.524 --> 12:09.526
[hold music playing]

12:12.089 --> 12:14.991
I know you're angry with me,
but she's acting strange.

12:15.091 --> 12:17.694
-She's hiding
something, poorly.
-What's wrong?

12:18.495 --> 12:20.637
Nothing.

12:20.737 --> 12:23.640
You go from staring at me,
which indicates
aggressive thoughts,

12:23.740 --> 12:26.443
to glancing down,
indicating introspection.

12:26.543 --> 12:28.445
You do so
at a three-to-one ratio,

12:28.545 --> 12:30.527
last seen when you blackmailed
me for those cold cases,

12:30.627 --> 12:32.629
so I ask again...

12:33.389 --> 12:35.391
what's wrong?

12:35.952 --> 12:37.954
Well, if you must know,

12:39.035 --> 12:42.698
Tyler's father has developed
a, um, sudden urge

12:42.798 --> 12:44.460
to have a relationship
with his son.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.303
-Is that so bad?
-Yes, it's bad!

12:47.403 --> 12:49.825
Oh, he abused you.

12:49.925 --> 12:51.067
Wait, no--

12:51.167 --> 12:53.549
Oh, Cammie, I am so sorry.
No wonder you're such a mess.

12:53.649 --> 12:57.753
No, Marcus didn't
abuse anyone, okay? He just...
just disappeared on us.

12:57.853 --> 13:00.155
-No, I get it.
-You get it?

13:00.255 --> 13:02.257
You are a lot,

13:02.578 --> 13:04.480
which reminds me,

13:04.580 --> 13:06.161
I've been wondering
why you took that job

13:06.261 --> 13:07.483
at the paper
in the first place.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.044
That's what I'm talking about.

13:09.144 --> 13:12.287
It wasn't for the money,
surely not the benefits.

13:12.387 --> 13:13.689
The Post barely has a roof,

13:13.789 --> 13:16.051
let alone pension
and health packages.

13:16.151 --> 13:19.134
Look, I-I didn't come here
to answer your questions, okay?

13:19.234 --> 13:20.735
I came to ask you questions.

13:20.835 --> 13:23.898
Then I realised
the paper gave you access

13:23.998 --> 13:26.741
to databases that were
otherwise inaccessible,

13:26.841 --> 13:29.784
namely the legal
and public records kind.

13:29.884 --> 13:33.908
So when that pinguid prick
Marcus Malin became untenable,

13:34.008 --> 13:36.050
you found another job
that gave you access...

13:37.011 --> 13:38.713
Boggsville PD.

13:38.813 --> 13:42.076
Marcus fired me,
so I took this job
for the benefits, okay?

13:42.176 --> 13:44.999
What I couldn't fathom is
why you never found
what you were looking for.

13:45.099 --> 13:46.480
[Cammie sighs]

13:46.580 --> 13:48.522
But then it hit me.

13:48.622 --> 13:52.006
You stopped looking
because you had Tyler.

13:52.106 --> 13:54.809
There you go.
You got her up
against the ropes.

13:54.909 --> 13:56.910
Why do you think
about me so much?

13:58.512 --> 14:00.614
Do you have a crush?

14:00.714 --> 14:02.096
That is not
what is happening here.

14:02.196 --> 14:05.939
Oh, 'cause it's... it's feeling
real crush-y in here.

14:06.039 --> 14:07.381
[woman on phone] Hello?
How can I help you?

14:07.481 --> 14:09.483
[in Spanish accent]
Last four digits, 8128.
Gracias.

14:13.246 --> 14:15.148
[in normal voice] Vida Perez.

14:15.248 --> 14:17.250
Yeah, I need to access
some old statements.

14:20.533 --> 14:25.218
Yeah, sure, I can answer
a few identity verification
questions.

14:26.539 --> 14:27.921
Mother's maiden name?

14:28.021 --> 14:28.962
[whispers] Famosa.

14:29.062 --> 14:31.244
Famosa.

14:31.344 --> 14:32.245
Date of birth?

14:32.345 --> 14:33.766
April 9th.

14:33.866 --> 14:36.409
-April 10, 19... Oh, sorry!
-9th.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.511
Sorry, April 9th. [chuckles]

14:39.312 --> 14:40.373
Wow!

14:40.473 --> 14:42.835
You know how it is.
One too many Cosmos.

14:45.558 --> 14:47.560
The make of my first car?

14:48.320 --> 14:49.742
I'm just a projection,
remember?

14:49.842 --> 14:52.264
Who are these people, the CIA?

14:52.364 --> 14:54.366
It was some type
of convertible.

14:55.247 --> 14:58.070
[sighs] She told me
she wrecked it
within the first week.

14:58.170 --> 14:59.391
[chuckles] Wow!

14:59.491 --> 15:02.434
You guys sure do go down
memory lane, don't you?

15:02.534 --> 15:05.758
Instead of punishing her,
Alejandro bought her a puppy,

15:05.858 --> 15:07.559
which she named Beemer,
after the car.

15:07.659 --> 15:08.680
It was a BMW.

15:08.780 --> 15:10.682
A BMW convertible.

15:10.782 --> 15:12.784
Obnoxious
for a first car, right?

15:13.585 --> 15:15.567
I grew up privileged.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.409
I was a total asshole.

15:17.509 --> 15:19.251
Still am. [chuckles]

15:19.351 --> 15:20.372
That's great.

15:20.472 --> 15:23.154
Uh, I have a new email,
if you'd be so kind.

15:27.519 --> 15:29.521
[sighs] All right,
a deal's a deal, Bell.

15:30.882 --> 15:34.305
While we wait, you can
tell me about that night.

15:34.405 --> 15:36.187
Tell me what you were
looking for at the newspaper.

15:36.287 --> 15:38.469
No, no.

15:38.569 --> 15:41.452
That little thing you do
is not gonna work, okay?

15:43.334 --> 15:45.896
I pulled the tape
of your interview
with the sheriff.

15:47.138 --> 15:49.080
Yeah, that's right.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.182
Look at me going
all detective and shit.

15:57.988 --> 15:59.610
Vida was complicated.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.132
[somber music playing]

16:02.232 --> 16:04.234
She was charming, but...

16:07.758 --> 16:09.760
Sometimes...

16:12.843 --> 16:14.845
Tell me what happened.

16:19.809 --> 16:21.811
The night before her murder...

16:24.414 --> 16:25.515
was the anniversary

16:25.615 --> 16:27.157
of my father's death.

16:27.257 --> 16:30.680
Oh, my God, people lose
their parents every damn day!

16:30.780 --> 16:32.682
You've been checked out
of this marriage for months!

16:32.782 --> 16:34.043
Oh, look who finally noticed

16:34.143 --> 16:35.285
something
other than a new handbag...

16:35.385 --> 16:36.886
Whenever it is convenient
for you to check back in...

16:36.986 --> 16:37.967
Or who's fucking who
in Miami...

16:38.067 --> 16:39.769
It's always
about Bell, Bell, Bell...

16:39.869 --> 16:42.171
Or whatever else
she's always obsessing over
that has nothing to do with us!

16:42.271 --> 16:45.134
Like I don't even exist!
Open your eyes and look at me!

16:45.234 --> 16:46.976
-[thunder crashes]
-I needed you,
and you weren't there!

16:47.076 --> 16:48.778
I needed you, too, God damn it!

16:48.878 --> 16:51.100
Well, you're not worth it!

16:51.200 --> 16:53.202
So maybe I should find
someone who is!

16:59.448 --> 17:00.509
Fuck!

17:00.609 --> 17:01.670
I told her I never

17:01.770 --> 17:03.772
wanted to see her again.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.776
And then what happened?

17:09.778 --> 17:12.381
Hey! Hey!

17:19.227 --> 17:21.950
[Bell] I can't remember.
I can't remember.

17:23.712 --> 17:25.714
I can't remember.

17:28.036 --> 17:30.038
[sighs]

17:31.039 --> 17:33.041
[cell phone chimes]

17:34.002 --> 17:36.004
Statements are in.

17:38.646 --> 17:41.429
Clothes, clothes, more clothes,

17:41.529 --> 17:42.910
a nightclub in Destin.

17:43.010 --> 17:44.031
[Cammie] Hmm.

17:44.131 --> 17:48.556
A $750 charge
to the fishing marina.

17:48.656 --> 17:51.759
[scoffs] Vida doesn't strike me
as a fishing type of gal.

17:51.859 --> 17:53.861
[cell phone vibrating]

17:57.665 --> 17:59.046
[inhales deeply]

17:59.146 --> 18:00.567
Stay calm.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.669
I was born calm...

18:03.030 --> 18:04.171
literally.

18:04.271 --> 18:06.053
I had the umbilical cord
wrapped around my neck.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.155
Frankly,
it's a miracle I survived.

18:09.316 --> 18:11.418
Alicia, how nice
to hear from you.

18:11.518 --> 18:13.660
We're all ready for you
over here at Casa Prescott.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.022
[whispers] Hey. [snaps fingers]

18:15.122 --> 18:17.864
-[Alicia] Bellwether,
it's been a long time.
-[mouthing]

18:17.964 --> 18:22.349
Well, time flies
when you're having... fun.

18:22.449 --> 18:25.952
I've decided
it's too painful to see
my daughter's fresh grave.

18:26.052 --> 18:27.394
Sure, sure.

18:27.494 --> 18:29.596
What a shame.
I was so looking forward to...

18:29.696 --> 18:32.398
So you'll meet me at Shucks
in an hour instead,

18:32.498 --> 18:35.061
unless that would be
too stressful for you.

18:36.302 --> 18:38.304
See you in an hour.

18:39.105 --> 18:41.487
[quirky music playing]

18:41.587 --> 18:43.589
I got this.

18:44.870 --> 18:46.872
[door slides open]

18:51.077 --> 18:53.078
Wow.

18:53.559 --> 18:54.500
Too much?

18:54.600 --> 18:56.462
[scoffs]

18:56.562 --> 18:59.225
Hmm.
All you're missing is a couple
of cartoon animal friends

18:59.325 --> 19:01.326
singing about
how great slavery was.

19:02.007 --> 19:04.009
Perfect.
I'll see you in an hour.

19:09.494 --> 19:11.496
[engine starts]

19:17.422 --> 19:19.424
Why does he put himself
through this?

19:21.026 --> 19:25.130
He needs to prove
that he's more than
what she thinks he is.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.232
Why?

19:27.552 --> 19:29.694
Oh, honey, gonna need a drink.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.136
Come on.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.878
This goes back
long before Vida.

19:37.121 --> 19:40.565
Alicia's family owned
a big rum distillery in Cuba,

19:41.806 --> 19:44.108
but when Castro moved in,

19:44.208 --> 19:46.691
old Quique Famosa pulled up
stakes and moved here.

19:48.132 --> 19:50.614
He opened El Calvero Rum,

19:52.256 --> 19:56.760
but you can't make rum
without cane syrup,

19:56.860 --> 20:00.324
so he struck a deal
with Prescott Sugar.

20:00.424 --> 20:02.646
You were in business
with Vida's family?

20:02.746 --> 20:04.748
Indigo
never shared details, but...

20:06.990 --> 20:08.992
there were issues.

20:09.353 --> 20:11.535
Yeah, I'm sure Bell and Vida
getting together

20:11.635 --> 20:14.538
didn't exactly help
the situation.

20:14.638 --> 20:16.640
[chuckles] Well,
in a way, it did.

20:18.682 --> 20:21.244
Alejandro
convinced Indigo to...

20:22.565 --> 20:23.747
sell the company.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.990
So, after 120 years,

20:27.090 --> 20:29.152
Prescott Sugar was no more.

20:29.252 --> 20:30.353
[Cammie] Hmm.

20:30.453 --> 20:32.155
At first, it was wonderful.

20:32.255 --> 20:35.018
We traveled,
and we worked in the garden.

20:36.179 --> 20:38.181
We made love all the time.

20:39.021 --> 20:40.123
Good to know.

20:40.223 --> 20:41.684
[chuckles]

20:41.784 --> 20:43.726
Bell and Vida were happy, too.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.828
Were they, though?

20:46.269 --> 20:48.090
Look, I... [chuckles]

20:48.190 --> 20:50.373
I want to help, Millicent.

20:50.473 --> 20:53.335
I do, but it's hard to help
when I don't have
the full picture.

20:53.435 --> 20:56.038
The full picture
is Bell was happy.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.883
But right after
Indigo died, he...

21:04.006 --> 21:06.008
He changed. I don't know why.

21:07.449 --> 21:09.451
Ah. Wow.

21:10.492 --> 21:12.995
Thank you for the drink
and the chat.

21:13.095 --> 21:15.097
-I should go.
-Um...

21:16.858 --> 21:19.661
I hope that you find
what you're digging for.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.824
And I hope
what you're digging for

21:23.345 --> 21:25.347
does not hurt my son

21:25.827 --> 21:27.829
because I love him...

21:28.910 --> 21:30.912
as much as you love yours.

21:35.476 --> 21:37.478
Okay.

21:39.921 --> 21:41.923
[country song playing]

21:48.769 --> 21:50.771
[music distorts]

22:02.783 --> 22:04.885
Alicia.

22:04.985 --> 22:06.987
You look well.

22:08.388 --> 22:10.771
Too bad
Alejandro couldn't join us.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.873
It would have been nice to...

22:13.313 --> 22:15.315
see the dude.

22:15.796 --> 22:17.798
"Dude"?

22:18.478 --> 22:20.480
That's how calm I am.

22:21.161 --> 22:22.662
Actually,
he doesn't know I'm here.

22:22.762 --> 22:24.764
[clicking]

22:26.966 --> 22:28.968
[clicking intensifies]

22:30.930 --> 22:33.052
I am uninterested in having
an affair with a married woman!

22:34.894 --> 22:36.896
That was a joke.

22:37.377 --> 22:39.379
You're my former mother-in-law.
I hate you!

22:40.139 --> 22:42.141
That's also a joke. [chuckles]

23:02.761 --> 23:04.763
[sighs]

23:05.764 --> 23:07.766
I know you're angry.

23:10.208 --> 23:13.932
If it helps, I acknowledge
that I was not without blame
in Vida's death.

23:16.855 --> 23:18.857
Had I...

23:19.377 --> 23:21.379
dealt with our issues...

23:23.381 --> 23:25.383
maybe she'd still be with me.

23:27.465 --> 23:29.467
I don't like you, Bellwether.

23:29.948 --> 23:31.950
Never have.

23:32.550 --> 23:34.953
But in the end,
we want the same thing...

23:36.794 --> 23:38.796
truth.

23:47.565 --> 23:50.007
[Bell] That's him.
That's Vida's lover.

23:52.289 --> 23:53.671
Please do not break my bottle.

23:53.771 --> 23:55.953
You'll get
Mountain Dew everywhere,
and then the ants will come,

23:56.053 --> 23:57.354
and this is
basically my office.

23:57.454 --> 24:00.878
You drink Mountain Dew?
Are you a teenage boy?

24:00.978 --> 24:03.320
Oh, no.
[chuckling] No, no, no, no, no.

24:03.420 --> 24:06.523
You are not
pointing the finger,
King of Weird Choices.

24:06.623 --> 24:09.486
Now, did Mrs. Perez
give you a name

24:09.586 --> 24:10.767
or tell you where she got this?

24:10.867 --> 24:13.890
Or did she just Google Image
"suspicious photo"?

24:13.990 --> 24:15.532
She doesn't know his name.

24:15.632 --> 24:17.414
And it was taken
by a private detective

24:17.514 --> 24:19.416
for reasons
she refused to share with me.

24:19.516 --> 24:20.817
Do you think I'm a narcissist?

24:20.917 --> 24:22.018
Yes.

24:22.118 --> 24:23.940
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

24:24.040 --> 24:26.042
But I think about you
all the time.

24:26.603 --> 24:27.704
You do?

24:27.804 --> 24:29.806
I mean...

24:30.206 --> 24:32.208
not like that. [scoffs]

24:33.650 --> 24:37.433
Okay, uh, well, if Alicia
had this the whole time,

24:37.533 --> 24:39.035
then why wasn't it
in the police file?

24:39.135 --> 24:41.437
Because
what she cares about most
is her family's reputation.

24:41.537 --> 24:44.040
Hmm.

24:44.140 --> 24:48.124
Well, people have a lot
of complicated reasons
for doing what they do.

24:48.224 --> 24:49.765
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

24:49.865 --> 24:51.867
Really?
It seemed like something.

24:52.628 --> 24:53.769
Mm.

24:53.869 --> 24:56.132
[whimsical music playing]

24:56.232 --> 24:58.414
You should start at the marina.

24:58.514 --> 25:00.976
Find out
about that $750 charge.

25:01.076 --> 25:04.139
Okay, before it was
"we, we, we."
Now it's just me?

25:04.239 --> 25:05.661
I could go into
cardiac arrest at any moment.

25:05.761 --> 25:07.142
Do you really want my death
on your hands?

25:07.242 --> 25:08.784
No, you're not guilting me.

25:08.884 --> 25:10.025
Also, I could vomit.

25:10.125 --> 25:11.787
Okay, fine. Get out.

25:11.887 --> 25:13.829
But for the record,
I am not doing this for you.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.991
I'm doing this
because I have questions
that need to be answered.

25:16.091 --> 25:17.272
Is that clear?

25:17.372 --> 25:19.554
Yes. This is all for you.
None of this is for me.

25:19.654 --> 25:21.156
-Mm-hmm.
-Is that better?

25:21.256 --> 25:23.258
Yes, actually. Thank you.

25:24.859 --> 25:26.861
Bye.

25:32.787 --> 25:34.789
[quirky music playing]

25:38.112 --> 25:40.114
Sorry about that.

25:41.916 --> 25:44.058
And I'm sorry about that.

25:44.158 --> 25:46.020
You want to make this
a thing, lady?

25:46.120 --> 25:48.703
No, I don't,

25:48.803 --> 25:50.805
but I will if you don't answer
my question.

25:52.486 --> 25:54.108
When did you say
that money got paid?

25:54.208 --> 25:56.070
A little over five years ago.

25:56.170 --> 25:57.311
That's what I figured.

25:57.411 --> 25:58.993
Meaning?

25:59.093 --> 26:03.237
Owners of the marina
were pissed this was
gonna get all gentrified.

26:03.337 --> 26:05.199
They wanted to fuck
with the developers,

26:05.299 --> 26:07.301
so they sold boat slips
for cheap.

26:08.101 --> 26:10.604
750 bucks, clear title.

26:10.704 --> 26:13.347
So the developers would have
to pay through the nose
to buy them back.

26:14.107 --> 26:15.449
[chuckles] Good move.

26:15.549 --> 26:17.551
[chuckles]
Didn't turn out that way.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.895
I cleaned out my bank account
to buy three of them.

26:21.995 --> 26:25.418
Then everything went to shit
'cause Bell Prescott
abandoned the project.

26:25.518 --> 26:27.721
Jesus, does everything
lead back to that?

26:29.122 --> 26:30.343
[man chuckles]

26:30.443 --> 26:32.525
I call a shark
"pinata of the sea."

26:33.806 --> 26:35.808
Never know
what you're gonna get.

26:37.210 --> 26:39.112
I'd cover your nose.

26:39.212 --> 26:41.214
[man chuckles]

26:43.216 --> 26:45.278
[gags] Oh, God,
my son would love this.

26:45.378 --> 26:47.480
[chuckles]

26:47.580 --> 26:50.583
So why did Vida
get a boat slip?

26:53.546 --> 26:55.548
Oh, hell, lady...

26:56.388 --> 26:58.390
you don't know?

26:59.672 --> 27:01.674
Bellwether.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.557
Motherfucker.

27:09.481 --> 27:11.864
Hey! Shit. Freeze!

27:11.964 --> 27:13.966
[tense music playing]

27:16.568 --> 27:17.990
[people murmuring]

27:18.090 --> 27:20.192
[grunts]

27:20.292 --> 27:22.294
[man grunts]

27:28.580 --> 27:29.881
Shit!

27:29.981 --> 27:31.983
[pants]

27:32.624 --> 27:34.205
Ugh!

27:34.305 --> 27:36.307
I'm gonna have to see
your license and registration,
ticket lady.

27:39.470 --> 27:41.472
Real funny.

27:42.313 --> 27:44.315
[grunts]

27:47.278 --> 27:49.280
What are you looking at?

27:54.285 --> 27:56.747
You're telling me
you didn't know
the boat existed.

27:56.847 --> 27:58.589
That is exactly
what I'm telling you.

27:58.689 --> 28:02.233
So the guy who got away from me
was screwing your wife

28:02.333 --> 28:04.995
and living on a boat
you didn't know about?

28:05.095 --> 28:06.116
She hated boats.

28:06.216 --> 28:08.118
Maybe not so much.

28:08.218 --> 28:10.701
On a scale of one to ten,
ten being me,

28:12.142 --> 28:13.844
how good-looking
would you say he was?

28:13.944 --> 28:15.946
That's what you're
thinking about right now?

28:18.909 --> 28:21.731
Well, he, um,
he was was mostly running,

28:21.831 --> 28:23.814
so I only got a really
good look at his backside,

28:23.914 --> 28:27.217
which was honestly terrific.

28:27.317 --> 28:29.219
He's, like, real strong

28:29.319 --> 28:31.261
and really good
at throwing stuff in my way,

28:31.361 --> 28:33.583
like, excellent.

28:33.683 --> 28:35.265
Right.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.887
Most importantly,
once he saw my uniform,
he... he ran like hell.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.832
He either had something to do
with Vida's murder,
or he knows something about it.

28:42.932 --> 28:44.233
Either way,
we need to find him.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.355
[cell phone vibrating]

28:46.455 --> 28:48.598
No, no, no,
I... I need to go home,

28:48.698 --> 28:51.801
but we are having
a long-ass talk in the morning,
you get me?

28:51.901 --> 28:55.064
I would say don't leave town,
but, um, I think
that goes without saying.

28:57.987 --> 29:00.089
If you want to come home early
for any reason,

29:00.189 --> 29:01.290
you know what number
to call, right?

29:01.390 --> 29:03.452
-[Tyler] 911?
-Yep.

29:03.552 --> 29:06.215
And I'll be there faster
than Spider-Man, okay?

29:06.315 --> 29:07.416
What's all this?

29:07.516 --> 29:09.298
I want to show him
all my favourite things.

29:09.398 --> 29:11.400
Maybe my favourite things
are the same as his.

29:13.602 --> 29:17.986
Well, let's just
take one tonight,

29:18.086 --> 29:20.909
and then we can, um, tell him
about all the others, okay?

29:21.009 --> 29:22.631
Why?

29:22.731 --> 29:25.994
Because it's a new friendship,

29:26.094 --> 29:28.096
and you want
to feel things out...

29:28.897 --> 29:30.278
just like when we go to Costco

29:30.378 --> 29:32.680
and try all the samples
before deciding what...

29:32.780 --> 29:33.882
what dinner to get.

29:33.982 --> 29:37.445
Wait, I thought you said
the samples were dinner.

29:37.545 --> 29:41.049
Look, the point is
you don't want to get
too attached to someone

29:41.149 --> 29:43.151
before you know
they're good for you.

29:44.432 --> 29:46.494
And if they're not,
that's okay,

29:46.594 --> 29:48.256
'cause I'll always be here.

29:48.356 --> 29:50.358
And we'll always have
each other, all right?

29:51.198 --> 29:53.200
-[knock on door]
-Okay.

29:53.721 --> 29:55.723
All right. [sighs]

29:58.045 --> 29:59.146
Hi.

29:59.246 --> 30:01.248
Make sure that his car seat's
secured properly, okay?

30:02.209 --> 30:04.211
Come on.

30:04.651 --> 30:06.353
And easy on the sugar,
all right?

30:06.453 --> 30:07.755
You can give him dessert,

30:07.855 --> 30:09.636
but don't just
give him dessert, okay?

30:09.736 --> 30:11.078
I know. I know, Cam.

30:11.178 --> 30:13.320
Hmm.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.082
Hey, um, I just want
to say thank you

30:15.182 --> 30:17.184
for, you know,
changing your mind.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.986
-Yeah.
-Come on.

30:21.588 --> 30:23.590
-Dr. Dinosaur.
-Dr. Dinosaur. Okay.

30:30.957 --> 30:32.959
[sighs]

30:38.604 --> 30:40.606
[quirky music playing]

30:47.613 --> 30:49.615
[chuckles]

30:53.259 --> 30:55.081
No.

30:55.181 --> 30:56.962
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:57.062 --> 30:59.064
-[phone chimes]
-Um...

31:00.226 --> 31:02.227
[softly] Dumb joke.

31:11.196 --> 31:13.799
Oh, come on.
Who doesn't know a booty call
when they see one?

31:14.680 --> 31:16.682
[quirky music continues]

31:28.013 --> 31:30.014
Not smart, exposing your queen.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.378
My queen betrayed me,
Skramstad.

31:37.422 --> 31:38.803
Thank you.

31:38.903 --> 31:40.765
I don't remember the last
time I went to a restaurant

31:40.865 --> 31:43.808
that didn't have crayons
on the table. [chuckles]

31:43.908 --> 31:45.910
So how long you plan
on staying in Boggsville?

31:47.271 --> 31:48.372
What do you mean?

31:48.472 --> 31:51.616
You seem more city
than country,

31:51.716 --> 31:54.739
and this place is real country.

31:54.839 --> 31:56.540
You trying to say I'm urban?

31:56.640 --> 31:58.062
Who you calling urban?
[chuckles]

31:58.162 --> 32:02.947
I mean, I got six more
months' worth of contract.

32:03.047 --> 32:04.989
I don't have a choice,

32:05.089 --> 32:07.191
but you could just
hit the highway,

32:07.291 --> 32:09.033
head back to Detroit.

32:09.133 --> 32:12.696
Hm. No, I can't
take Tyler out of state
without Marcus' permission.

32:13.857 --> 32:15.839
You never
should have left Detroit.

32:15.939 --> 32:19.282
Good music scene, nice zoo.

32:19.382 --> 32:20.444
High murder rates.

32:20.544 --> 32:22.365
Fantastic barbecue.

32:22.465 --> 32:24.488
Rampant heroin use.

32:24.588 --> 32:26.089
Burgeoning arts scene.

32:26.189 --> 32:28.471
Massive foreclosures.

32:29.672 --> 32:32.375
This is getting very sexy.

32:32.475 --> 32:34.577
Tell me about it.

32:34.677 --> 32:38.581
Unfortunately, I ran out
of things to say about Detroit.

32:38.681 --> 32:40.683
-[imperceptible]
-[Cammie chuckles]

32:44.367 --> 32:47.790
So it turns out hauling
a 12-ton amphibious vehicle

32:47.890 --> 32:51.674
with a van is
a lot more taxing on the engine
than you could even imagine.

32:51.774 --> 32:53.836
I mean, I don't even know how
I got it in here.

32:53.936 --> 32:55.938
It was one go.

32:56.739 --> 32:58.481
[tense music playing]

32:58.581 --> 33:00.583
Are you all right, man?

33:01.584 --> 33:03.585
I'm fine.

33:05.027 --> 33:08.410
You want to work out
tomorrow maybe?

33:08.510 --> 33:10.512
No, I do not.

33:12.234 --> 33:14.236
Now you should go.

33:15.917 --> 33:17.919
Fine.

33:27.008 --> 33:28.750
You either bought this
for your lover

33:28.850 --> 33:30.231
and named it
after your husband,

33:30.331 --> 33:32.333
which would be psychotic
to the point of nonsensical.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.618
Or I bought this boat for you.

33:38.339 --> 33:40.341
Surprise.

33:42.423 --> 33:44.425
It was for my birthday.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.567
I didn't make it
till then, did I?

33:46.667 --> 33:48.669
Vida.

33:49.390 --> 33:51.392
Is that why you kept
the boat slip payment secret?

33:54.155 --> 33:55.096
You still...

33:55.196 --> 33:57.198
Loved you?

33:57.758 --> 33:59.760
I never stopped.

34:02.963 --> 34:04.785
Then why was your lover
living on my boat?

34:04.885 --> 34:06.927
[cell phone ringing]

34:09.770 --> 34:12.753
-Darby?
-Hey. About time you picked up.

34:12.853 --> 34:14.114
Funny story...

34:14.214 --> 34:16.216
you won't believe
who's at Sweet Water.

34:16.657 --> 34:20.360
Cammie and Otis together.

34:20.460 --> 34:22.682
Well, good for them.
They're adults.
They can do adult stuff.

34:22.782 --> 34:24.524
Oh.

34:24.624 --> 34:25.725
You guys aren't a thing?

34:25.825 --> 34:26.967
Cammie and I?

34:27.067 --> 34:29.809
[scoffs] No, we have no things.

34:29.909 --> 34:32.012
We are colleagues,
unofficial colleagues,

34:32.112 --> 34:34.614
as we are not paid
for our colleague-ness.

34:34.714 --> 34:36.496
Okay. Never mind, then.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.899
I will let them get back
to their daiquiris.

34:39.999 --> 34:41.781
They're drinking daiquiris?

34:41.881 --> 34:43.783
Mm, yeah, lots.

34:43.883 --> 34:45.885
What kind?

34:47.607 --> 34:48.548
Hemingway.

34:48.648 --> 34:50.650
That's our drink.

34:51.691 --> 34:53.753
Report back
with further developments.

34:53.853 --> 34:57.797
It sounds like being
the only cop in town
is exciting.

34:57.897 --> 35:00.259
Mm! One time
I pulled over T-Pain.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.761
Got a selfie out of it.

35:02.861 --> 35:05.024
-What's he like?
-He was real pissed.

35:05.824 --> 35:07.406
-Mm.
-Yeah.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.848
But, I mean, I pulled him over,
so it was legitimate.

35:09.948 --> 35:11.610
And then
there's people like Bell.

35:11.710 --> 35:14.653
He's capable
of pretty much anything.

35:14.753 --> 35:16.755
Even killing his wife?

35:19.478 --> 35:21.480
[tense music playing]

35:33.171 --> 35:35.113
[sniffing]

35:35.213 --> 35:38.496
[Cammie] Hypothetically,
what if there was evidence
that tied him to the murder?

35:40.098 --> 35:42.100
Even if he didn't
remember it, hmm?

35:43.061 --> 35:45.062
-Hypothetically?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.366
30% of the time,
he's 80% blitzed.

35:48.466 --> 35:49.967
You get blackout drunk,

35:50.067 --> 35:51.489
the hippocampus
can't form memories,

35:51.589 --> 35:54.111
which means if Bell killed her
when he was drunk,

35:55.513 --> 35:57.515
he wouldn't have
to try and forget

35:58.275 --> 36:00.498
because he would be incapable
of remembering.

36:00.598 --> 36:02.660
So, hypothetically,

36:02.760 --> 36:04.762
on the hypothetical...

36:06.283 --> 36:10.387
if it happened
and if there was evidence

36:10.487 --> 36:11.829
and if he had to stand trial...

36:11.929 --> 36:13.230
All I know is this...

36:13.330 --> 36:16.093
Bell Prescott
is not on this date,

36:17.694 --> 36:20.097
and I'm not the kind of man
who likes to share his time.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.502
-Is that so?
-Mm.

36:27.824 --> 36:29.826
[Cammie] Hmm.

36:50.006 --> 36:51.627
[suspenseful music playing]

36:51.727 --> 36:53.729
[siren chirps]

37:02.738 --> 37:04.640
Where do you get off
spying on me?

37:04.740 --> 37:06.322
It's not spying.

37:06.422 --> 37:09.084
But I am curious
why you were on a date
with Otis.

37:09.184 --> 37:11.887
At least Otis can go on a date.

37:11.987 --> 37:14.149
Also, I don't need
to justify my shit to you.

37:17.272 --> 37:18.453
What are you doing?

37:18.553 --> 37:19.695
Oh, relax.

37:19.795 --> 37:21.797
I preserved
all the relevant clues.

37:22.878 --> 37:24.880
What relevant clues?

37:27.682 --> 37:30.465
First this beaded ring,
green and yellow...

37:30.565 --> 37:32.567
Miccosukee representation
of a turtle.

37:33.408 --> 37:35.150
Could have been a souvenir...

37:35.250 --> 37:37.252
-Are you out of your mind?
-Other than the single
weaving stitch.

37:38.052 --> 37:39.714
Maybe an expensive souvenir.

37:39.814 --> 37:43.478
But then I found this...
sarsaparilla.

37:43.578 --> 37:45.600
Note the bit of string
at the end,

37:45.700 --> 37:47.922
therefore,
the remains of a smudge.

37:48.022 --> 37:49.964
[sniffs] Likely homemade
by an elder.

37:50.064 --> 37:52.366
You just took the damn boat?

37:52.466 --> 37:54.328
It has my name on it,
so it must be mine.

37:54.428 --> 37:56.410
And thank God I took it,
because, clearly,

37:56.510 --> 37:58.773
these clues suggest
that the lover

37:58.873 --> 38:01.776
has some connection
to the Miccosukee tribe...

38:01.876 --> 38:04.038
a virtual fact when
you take into account this.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.621
Peacock.

38:07.721 --> 38:10.544
Found on the Velcro
of his backpack.

38:10.644 --> 38:12.646
Very attractive.

38:13.927 --> 38:15.909
Could be ornamental.

38:16.009 --> 38:17.150
But smell.

38:17.250 --> 38:20.714
[sniffs] Oh, God,
it smells like piss.

38:20.814 --> 38:23.036
No, boric acid,
to prevent mites,

38:23.136 --> 38:26.520
therefore natural,
not preserved.

38:26.620 --> 38:30.203
Still downy, which means
it came from a juvenile.

38:30.303 --> 38:32.245
Interesting birds, peafowl.

38:32.345 --> 38:35.208
Uh, polygamous,
much like yourself.

38:35.308 --> 38:37.991
And the juveniles stay close
to home because of predators,

38:39.152 --> 38:41.214
also like yourself.

38:41.314 --> 38:45.738
Regardless, because
of our rampant destruction
of their habitat,

38:45.838 --> 38:49.402
home means the northeast corner
of the Miccosukee camp.

38:50.082 --> 38:51.264
Ta-da!

38:51.364 --> 38:53.266
That's why I took the boat,

38:53.366 --> 38:56.228
because now
we know the lothario

38:56.328 --> 38:58.931
is either Miccosukee
or Miccosukee-adjacent.

39:00.933 --> 39:02.835
You done?

39:02.935 --> 39:04.236
Yes, I am done.

39:04.336 --> 39:08.140
Are you sure,
or you gonna splooge
some more factual garbage?

39:10.382 --> 39:12.164
I'm done.

39:12.264 --> 39:16.568
Good, because I slept on it,
I prayed on it,

39:16.668 --> 39:21.293
and I am done with you
and this psycho relationship.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.015
If I had half the sense
I was born with,

39:23.115 --> 39:24.896
I would arrest you right now.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.658
On what grounds? It's my boat.

39:26.758 --> 39:28.760
On grounds of homicide.

39:29.321 --> 39:31.022
You were blackout drunk,
and you...

39:31.122 --> 39:33.124
you killed your wife.

39:33.925 --> 39:35.467
This whole
bullshit investigation

39:35.567 --> 39:37.729
is just your...
your psyche's way
of admitting guilt.

39:41.893 --> 39:43.895
I have proof.

39:45.336 --> 39:47.338
I have fucking proof.

39:54.105 --> 39:56.087
Wait, what?

39:56.187 --> 39:58.189
You found a murder weapon?

39:59.350 --> 40:01.452
Yeah, I'll explain later,

40:01.552 --> 40:03.554
but we'll need
your fingerprint examiner.

40:04.355 --> 40:06.737
[sighs] Is this
about the Vida Perez case?

40:06.837 --> 40:09.019
Yeah.

40:09.119 --> 40:10.701
Jesus, Cammie.

40:10.801 --> 40:12.623
You were right about Prescott.

40:12.723 --> 40:14.745
[knock on door]

40:14.845 --> 40:16.847
I got to go.

40:19.409 --> 40:21.411
-Hey.
-Hi.

40:21.772 --> 40:23.113
-I got him.
-No, you'll wake him up.

40:23.213 --> 40:26.556
-I said... I said I got him.
-Okay, okay.

40:26.656 --> 40:28.658
Hey, bud.

40:29.219 --> 40:31.221
[Cammie groans]

40:32.262 --> 40:34.264
Okay, thanks.

40:42.271 --> 40:44.273
[door closes softly]

40:56.605 --> 40:58.607
[sighs]

41:00.449 --> 41:02.611
[dialling]

41:06.575 --> 41:08.577
[phone ringing]

41:10.299 --> 41:12.301
Hello?

41:12.981 --> 41:14.983
Hi, Miss Tanika.

41:15.664 --> 41:17.686
Laila!

41:17.786 --> 41:20.769
-[chuckles]
-My God, it's been years!

41:20.869 --> 41:23.812
Where are you? How are you?

41:23.912 --> 41:26.274
-[chuckles]
-I'm good. I'm good.

41:27.996 --> 41:30.759
I'm sorry, I...
I tried to call before, but...

41:32.721 --> 41:34.722
I didn't know what to say.

41:35.083 --> 41:36.905
Do you need anything?

41:37.005 --> 41:39.007
Money? Anything?

41:39.607 --> 41:41.609
Just need things
to make sense again.

41:43.451 --> 41:45.453
Tell me what's wrong.

41:46.214 --> 41:48.516
Nothing. [sighs] It's nothing.

41:48.616 --> 41:50.618
We're... We're fine.

41:51.619 --> 41:53.040
-"We"?
-Yeah.

41:53.140 --> 41:55.142
Me and Tyler.

41:55.703 --> 41:56.644
My son.

41:56.744 --> 41:58.446
[chuckles]

41:58.546 --> 42:00.548
He's six.

42:00.868 --> 42:02.870
Smart as a whip.
Asks a lot of questions.

42:04.551 --> 42:09.016
Man, can he just brighten up
the room with that smile.

42:09.116 --> 42:12.279
It's different when
you have a little one
to look after, isn't it?

42:14.041 --> 42:18.085
I want you to know
that I might have been
chasing something that...

42:20.927 --> 42:23.210
doesn't feel like
it ever belonged to me.

42:27.254 --> 42:29.256
But you were always mine.

42:32.258 --> 42:33.480
You were always enough.

42:33.580 --> 42:35.041
Aw.

42:35.141 --> 42:37.083
You were mine, too, baby.

42:37.183 --> 42:39.185
[melancholic music playing]

42:44.470 --> 42:46.472
[suspenseful music playing]

43:32.157 --> 43:34.159
[bicycle bell ringing]

43:49.654 --> 43:51.656
Quick, follow me.

43:54.578 --> 43:56.080
[young Bell] Bell! Bell!

43:56.180 --> 43:58.182
We need to get
to the lighthouse!

43:58.823 --> 44:00.845
You need to follow me.

44:00.945 --> 44:03.948
-[Vida panting]
-[young Bell] Bell? Bell!

44:05.549 --> 44:07.551
[whimpers]

44:12.236 --> 44:14.178
Stop!

44:14.278 --> 44:15.179
[music stops]

44:15.279 --> 44:17.281
[ominous music playing]

44:32.696 --> 44:34.697
[banging on door]

44:43.666 --> 44:45.668
[gasps]

44:46.629 --> 44:48.631
[Bell] You were right.

44:50.433 --> 44:52.435
I think I killed her.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.382
I... I know
where to find her lover.

44:59.482 --> 45:01.484
I just...

45:02.444 --> 45:04.446
I need to look him
in the eyes. And then...

45:06.288 --> 45:08.290
then you can arrest me.

45:17.099 --> 45:19.101
[dialling]

45:23.305 --> 45:25.387
Hey, can you come watch Ty?

45:26.228 --> 45:28.230
Thanks.

45:29.511 --> 45:31.513
[Cammie sighs]

45:33.034 --> 45:35.036
[suspenseful music playing]

45:56.457 --> 45:58.539
[peacocks squawking]

46:18.278 --> 46:20.020
[door creaking]

46:20.120 --> 46:22.122
[dramatic music playing]

46:37.577 --> 46:38.718
Wha...

46:38.818 --> 46:40.820
[tense banjo music playing]
