<i>El Gato!</i>

00:32.354 --> 00:34.700
<b>2x01 - "Dragon"</b>

00:36.041 --> 00:40.839
<i>I am Puss in Boots,
and I believe one solitary truth.</i>

00:40.922 --> 00:42.841
When it comes to being a hero,

00:42.924 --> 00:45.635
there is no such thing
as too much helping.

00:45.719 --> 00:47.595
Trouble lurks!

00:49.973 --> 00:51.558
Protect me, Felina.

00:53.267 --> 00:54.101
Ha!

00:56.103 --> 00:58.940
<i>En garde!</i>

00:59.024 --> 01:00.025
Back, mosquito!

01:00.191 --> 01:02.068
Leave this man alone.

01:02.151 --> 01:03.110
Hold still.

01:04.696 --> 01:06.031
Ah-ha!

01:06.113 --> 01:07.365
Victory is mine!

01:08.783 --> 01:10.368
I am needed elsewhere.

01:14.039 --> 01:16.249
What is the soup of the day?

01:16.332 --> 01:20.211
Hold your horses, Old Pajuna's goin'
as fast as she can!

01:20.294 --> 01:21.629
<i>Help has arrived!</i>

01:23.631 --> 01:26.300
I will distribute these beverages for you.

01:38.855 --> 01:40.857
I can't get this carrot out!

01:40.941 --> 01:42.316
Surrender, carrot!

01:42.525 --> 01:45.361
Ah! Help is on the way, amigos!

01:56.581 --> 01:59.208
Puss in Boots will eat a raw eggplant.

01:59.292 --> 02:00.334
He does not care.

02:02.169 --> 02:03.254
Puss in the Boots!

02:03.337 --> 02:05.048
What is wrong with you?

02:05.256 --> 02:06.841
What?

02:06.925 --> 02:07.926
I am helping.

02:08.008 --> 02:09.009
Helping?

02:09.175 --> 02:12.931
If you want to help, you can go to
the market and buy some lard. Here.

02:13.098 --> 02:18.311
Unless purchasing lard is too
small a task for a hero such as yourself.

02:18.478 --> 02:21.606
Ha! There is no such thing
as a small task.

02:21.689 --> 02:23.524
Only small heroes.

02:23.608 --> 02:26.235
One of which I am not!

02:28.863 --> 02:30.698
I go!

02:30.865 --> 02:32.241
Hah!

02:44.211 --> 02:49.383
Here is a coin, in exchange for which
I demand your largest container of lard.

02:51.344 --> 02:52.261
Bigger.

02:54.014 --> 02:55.015
Much bigger!

02:56.808 --> 02:57.892
Bigger!

03:02.438 --> 03:06.233
- Hey, did you hear about the dragon?
- A dragon?

03:06.317 --> 03:07.986
Yeah! He's ferocious!

03:08.069 --> 03:11.114
It guards a massive hoard
of golden treasure.

03:11.196 --> 03:12.824
It has wings like this!

03:12.991 --> 03:14.575
And teeth like that!

03:14.659 --> 03:16.119
And breath of fire!

03:16.285 --> 03:19.580
I heard it burned down
three villages in one day.

03:19.664 --> 03:21.499
That's 21 villages a week!

03:21.582 --> 03:23.960
A thousand and ninety-five a year!

03:24.169 --> 03:27.714
Whoever will save us from this dragon?

03:29.883 --> 03:31.592
- I will!
- Huh?

03:40.894 --> 03:45.732
I will ride into the desert and slay
the dragon single-handedly.

03:45.815 --> 03:49.110
And when I do,
I will claim its treasure,

03:49.194 --> 03:54.157
making me, El Moco,
the wealthiest bandido who ever...

03:54.240 --> 03:55.449
<i>Not so fast!</i>

03:57.869 --> 03:59.328
<i> Run! Run!</i>

03:59.412 --> 04:00.955
El Gato.

04:08.796 --> 04:12.299
If anyone here is going
to slay a dragon, it will be me.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.969
But unlike you,
I do not slay for treasure.

04:15.053 --> 04:17.262
I slay for justice!

04:17.346 --> 04:18.346
Yah-ha!

04:19.974 --> 04:22.727
Would somebody please
put my lard on ice?

04:22.810 --> 04:24.478
Thank you!

04:30.610 --> 04:32.486
<i>Faster, Babieca!
Faster!</i>

04:32.570 --> 04:34.114
We have justice to deliver.

04:35.949 --> 04:39.493
Like a mail carrier who delivers
justice instead of letters.

04:53.507 --> 04:55.760
If I do not return from
this heroic mission,

04:55.843 --> 04:59.097
tell all whom you encounter
tales of my legend.

04:59.889 --> 05:02.850
Feel free to embellish.

05:29.710 --> 05:30.670
Dragon!

05:30.753 --> 05:32.463
I have come to slay you!

05:46.978 --> 05:49.105
I am Puss in... Oh.

06:04.411 --> 06:06.247
You are the dragon?

06:11.627 --> 06:14.714
Oh, you are not such a bad guy,
are you?

06:17.758 --> 06:20.136
You are just a big softy.

06:21.221 --> 06:22.263
<i>Dragon!</i>

06:24.431 --> 06:26.391
Time to die!

06:28.728 --> 06:29.770
Fear not, amigo.

06:29.854 --> 06:32.481
No harm shall come your way
on my watch.

06:34.067 --> 06:35.651
Move aside, gato.

06:35.818 --> 06:38.321
That dragon has a date with my sword.

06:38.529 --> 06:41.157
Well then,
it must be date night in...

06:41.657 --> 06:42.658
wherever we are,

06:42.742 --> 06:45.536
because my sword
has a date with your throat.

06:45.703 --> 06:47.663
Oh, really?

06:47.872 --> 06:49.498
Yes, really.

06:59.217 --> 07:01.135
Ha-ha!

07:04.764 --> 07:06.599
Dragon, not now.

07:22.573 --> 07:25.534
Let me out of here!
I'll tear you apart!

07:25.618 --> 07:27.328
Ha! No chance!

07:27.412 --> 07:29.914
You stay there
and think about what you did.

07:29.997 --> 07:32.583
<i> I'm going to kill you!</i>

07:32.792 --> 07:34.001
<i>Let me out!</i>

07:48.682 --> 07:50.226
Hello, Babieca.

08:05.992 --> 08:08.119
I will send someone to claim El Moco.

08:08.202 --> 08:10.204
He has a very large bounty on his head.

08:11.580 --> 08:14.375
Yes... Well, farewell.

08:14.459 --> 08:17.711
And you are not as awful as everyone says.

08:32.558 --> 08:35.229
No, no, you cannot come with me.

08:39.775 --> 08:43.779
Nice try. But I am the master
of making that face. See?

08:51.287 --> 08:52.705
You stay.

09:00.129 --> 09:02.048
Fine.

09:05.301 --> 09:10.431
<i>We want lard!
We want lard!</i>

09:11.098 --> 09:12.641
Can I have a salad?

09:13.226 --> 09:16.770
I told you,
we are out of lard!

09:16.854 --> 09:18.898
Then maybe we ought to eat you!

09:19.106 --> 09:21.734
<i>Did someone say lard?</i>

09:27.614 --> 09:29.200
<i>Yay!</i>

09:29.742 --> 09:31.285
Oh, thank heavens!

09:32.286 --> 09:33.371
Puss in the Boots!

09:33.454 --> 09:34.788
Look out!

09:36.040 --> 09:37.750
He followed me home.

09:37.833 --> 09:38.918
Can we keep him?

09:44.965 --> 09:47.968
<i>...and then I locked El Moco
in the treasure chest.</i>

09:48.135 --> 09:52.056
"Let me out, I cannot breathe!
It is so dark in here!"

09:52.139 --> 09:54.517
It was classic me.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.102
I don't understand.

09:56.310 --> 09:59.146
You see, the treasure chest
had a latch and...

09:59.355 --> 10:01.857
No, I mean,
why is that here?

10:02.816 --> 10:04.818
Oh, yes!
The dragon.

10:04.902 --> 10:08.448
Well, I rode out with the intention
of delivering justice,

10:08.531 --> 10:12.243
but when I arrived,
I was met with this old, sickly creature.

10:12.493 --> 10:14.203
Why, just look at him.

10:14.412 --> 10:16.289
So sad and scraggly.

10:16.456 --> 10:17.540
I must help him.

10:17.623 --> 10:18.874
Look at that face.

10:18.958 --> 10:20.084
Who is a good dragon?

10:20.167 --> 10:22.044
Who is a good dragon?

10:22.128 --> 10:24.297
You are the one
that is a good dragon.

10:24.380 --> 10:25.465
Can we name it?

10:25.548 --> 10:27.841
How about Dragon Toby?

10:28.008 --> 10:30.970
That is no name for a mighty beast
such as this.

10:31.178 --> 10:32.721
We shall call him...

10:34.599 --> 10:38.978
Now all I can think of is Dragon Toby.
Dragon Toby it is.

10:39.145 --> 10:40.187
Yay!

10:40.271 --> 10:42.523
You cannot keep a wild dragon here!

10:42.607 --> 10:44.150
They are dangerous!

10:45.651 --> 10:47.778
Oh, you say that about everything.

10:47.945 --> 10:48.988
I do not!

10:49.071 --> 10:50.990
Yeah, you kinda do.

10:51.198 --> 10:54.034
You said it about me,
and I'm as sweet as pie.

10:55.495 --> 10:57.163
Back off, Hamsack!

10:59.832 --> 11:01.167
Back, foul beast!

11:01.250 --> 11:04.629
Leave us be!

11:04.753 --> 11:08.215
You all underestimate the friendship
between a cat and his dragon.

11:08.466 --> 11:09.800
There is nothing to fear!

11:09.883 --> 11:13.387
The fates have conspired to bring
Dragon Toby and I together,

11:13.471 --> 11:16.307
and I intend to nurse him back to health.

11:16.390 --> 11:18.683
Because that is what a hero does.

11:21.354 --> 11:22.813
I know just what you need.

11:22.896 --> 11:27.485
Pajuna has the most hearty and restorative
leche a sick dragon could ask for!

11:29.529 --> 11:30.737
Mm.

11:31.780 --> 11:33.533
Wait here.
I will return.

11:37.578 --> 11:40.498
Did you see the size of that dragon?

11:40.581 --> 11:43.750
<i>Boy, he is so sick.</i>

11:45.628 --> 11:47.129
<i>This isn't frothy!</i>

11:50.383 --> 11:51.925
<i>You'd better make that a double!</i>

11:52.009 --> 11:54.970
- Puss.
- Pajuna, my old friend!

11:55.054 --> 11:56.305
How are you?

11:56.514 --> 11:58.641
Busy as a cow with two udders.

12:00.767 --> 12:02.228
Two udders!

12:02.311 --> 12:04.480
An amusingly folksy expression.

12:06.857 --> 12:10.444
So... I need a favor.

12:14.865 --> 12:16.825
This should be enough leche,

12:16.909 --> 12:18.411
even for a dragon.

12:21.622 --> 12:23.249
Hi, Puss!

12:23.416 --> 12:24.875
Ah, Artephius.

12:24.958 --> 12:28.295
I am glad to see someone in this town
taking a liking to Dragon Toby.

12:28.462 --> 12:30.839
Yep! He pulled me down to the ground,

12:30.923 --> 12:34.009
and because I have
a healthy fear of death, I let him.

12:35.511 --> 12:38.138
Does the good boy want some leche?

12:42.767 --> 12:44.270
Look, like this.

12:48.441 --> 12:50.025
It's like they say, Puss,

12:50.109 --> 12:53.820
"You can lead a dragon to milk,
but you can't make him drink."

12:54.029 --> 12:56.657
Whoever said that
never met Puss in Boots.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.711
This is going to be harder
than I thought.

14:40.177 --> 14:41.887
Three cheers for us!

14:42.137 --> 14:43.430
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

14:43.514 --> 14:45.140
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

14:45.224 --> 14:47.226
- Hip-hip!
- Hoo...

14:55.860 --> 14:57.611
Okay, boy, easy does it...

15:17.590 --> 15:20.133
Puss in the Boots!

15:20.217 --> 15:23.970
It is all right,
he is just happy to be healthy.

15:24.054 --> 15:26.766
I am certain he will not
keep this up for long.

15:31.478 --> 15:32.855
Fairly certain?

15:48.704 --> 15:51.373
Okay, that is enough,
Dragon Toby.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.668
Um, Puss?

15:55.210 --> 15:59.882
Oh, hello, Dulcinea.
Just taking the air with Dragon Toby.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.259
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

16:02.342 --> 16:06.096
Some people in town were thinking that
maybe it's time you bring Dragon Toby...

16:06.263 --> 16:07.848
A treat?
A treat for good boys?

16:08.432 --> 16:09.266
...back.

16:09.516 --> 16:11.518
What?
We cannot bring him back!

16:11.602 --> 16:12.728
It would break my...

16:13.312 --> 16:15.230
the orphans' hearts!

16:15.439 --> 16:16.941
It was their idea.

16:17.274 --> 16:19.318
He tore up my pickle patch!

16:19.401 --> 16:22.195
All that hard work, gone!

16:22.279 --> 16:24.364
I think he wants to eat me.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.871
And he stole my whole green and scaly bit.

16:30.955 --> 16:33.206
Without it, I'm nothing.

16:33.415 --> 16:35.709
I admit, he has been
a little over-exuberant

16:35.793 --> 16:37.085
since he started feeling better,

16:37.169 --> 16:40.172
but all he needs
is some basic obedience training.

16:40.255 --> 16:41.423
Here, watch.

16:41.507 --> 16:43.467
Dragon Toby, sit.

16:48.180 --> 16:49.431
I will work on it.

16:52.726 --> 16:54.478
Dragon Toby, no!

17:07.616 --> 17:10.828
<i>It is all right, Se?ora!
I have you!</i>

17:11.036 --> 17:13.163
Dragon Toby, stop!

17:18.961 --> 17:20.587
<i>Felina!</i>

17:30.890 --> 17:32.683
Did you see that?
He listened!

17:33.266 --> 17:35.268
That dragon has to go!

17:49.867 --> 17:52.160
You are a good boy,
Dragon Toby.

17:53.412 --> 17:55.873
But it is time for you to go.

18:00.878 --> 18:02.046
Ready?

18:09.595 --> 18:10.470
Easy does it.

18:11.889 --> 18:13.306
Steady!

18:15.642 --> 18:18.062
Okay, everyone, grab the rope.

18:22.232 --> 18:24.068
Dragon Toby! Sit! Sit!

18:33.744 --> 18:34.745
What is that?

18:34.828 --> 18:36.622
That is a very large dragon.

18:36.705 --> 18:39.083
It ain't so big.
Lemme at 'im!

18:39.165 --> 18:41.418
No, you take Dragon Toby to safety.

18:41.627 --> 18:43.003
Leave that to me.

19:08.445 --> 19:10.864
You are a terrible driver!

20:12.467 --> 20:15.179
Um, hello.
Excuse me, hi.

20:16.555 --> 20:18.598
Which one of you stole my baby?

20:19.516 --> 20:21.643
You mean Dragon Toby?

20:21.727 --> 20:23.687
He is no baby!
He is old!

20:23.896 --> 20:27.691
His name is Ephraim. He's one!

20:27.941 --> 20:30.652
What? If he is a baby,
why did he not say so?

20:30.819 --> 20:32.404
Because he's a baby!

20:33.238 --> 20:35.782
Ma'am, I'm awfully sorry
for the confusion.

20:35.991 --> 20:37.576
We were only trying to help.

20:37.659 --> 20:39.369
See how much healthier he is?

20:45.876 --> 20:48.461
Well... yes.

20:48.545 --> 20:51.924
And because he seems to like you,
I won't, you know,

20:52.007 --> 20:53.592
incinerate all of you.

20:54.259 --> 20:55.219
You're welcome.

20:56.720 --> 21:00.099
And you shouldn't stick your nose
in people's business.

21:00.182 --> 21:02.475
Come on, sweetie.
We're leaving.

21:13.361 --> 21:16.240
Farewell, Dragon Toby Ephraim.

21:16.322 --> 21:19.076
You have been...
a good friend.

21:25.457 --> 21:27.126
Who is cutting onions?

21:27.209 --> 21:30.045
You are getting onion waftings
all over my eyeballs.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.517
I don't do that, do I?

21:44.601 --> 21:47.020
What she said,
the sticking of the nose thing?

21:51.733 --> 21:54.444
The mosquito!
He has returned.

21:55.154 --> 21:57.906
I told you...
back, winged villain!

22:12.045 --> 22:14.923
Safe and sound.

22:15.007 --> 22:18.177
And that's the last time
Mama leaves you alone.

22:18.260 --> 22:20.929
<i>Puss in Boots!
I can hear you.</i>

22:21.013 --> 22:23.515
<i>Let me out of here
so I can rip you apart!</i>

22:24.183 --> 22:26.893
<i>I will unleash a volcano of rage!</i>

22:30.563 --> 22:31.773
Uh, never mind.
