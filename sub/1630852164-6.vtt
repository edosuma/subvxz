WEBVTT

00:12.291 --> 00:13.260
<i>Get the stew right up</i>

00:13.293 --> 00:15.097
<i>‐under her nose.
‐Okay. Okay.</i>

00:15.130 --> 00:16.432
And let if waft up in..

00:16.466 --> 00:17.536
She keeps moving..

00:17.569 --> 00:18.470
<i>and her hair keeps getting
in the stew.</i>

00:18.504 --> 00:20.374
<i>Guys, hey, guys, guys.</i>

00:20.407 --> 00:21.242
You can stop.

00:21.276 --> 00:23.514
Stew has never
woken anyone up, ever.

00:23.548 --> 00:24.683
Here, give me‐give me stew.

00:24.716 --> 00:26.486
‐I'll eat it.
‐All right, fine.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.689
But I feel like the stew...
No, see?

00:27.722 --> 00:29.392
It's... Oh, it worked!
Here she comes!

00:29.425 --> 00:30.728
‐Oh!
‐Hey, Dee!

00:30.762 --> 00:33.233
‐Don't worry, Dee...
‐Hi, Dee. Was it the stew
that woke you up?

00:33.266 --> 00:34.335
Ow. What happened?

00:34.368 --> 00:35.270
Oh, don't worry.

00:35.304 --> 00:37.576
We're, uh, safe and sound
in Patty's Pub.

00:37.609 --> 00:39.580
What? We're back home?

00:39.613 --> 00:40.615
‐Oh, no, no, no.
‐No.

00:40.648 --> 00:42.586
‐It's, uh "Patty's" with a T.
‐Yeah.

00:42.619 --> 00:44.422
‐P‐A‐T‐T‐Y.
‐What is going on?

00:44.455 --> 00:46.492
What‐what time is it?
What day is it?

00:46.527 --> 00:47.562
Wait, did I miss the thing?

00:47.596 --> 00:49.633
‐What thing? Oh, the show?
‐Uh, the acting thing?

00:49.666 --> 00:50.735
‐Oh, yeah, you missed it.
‐Oh, oh, no.

00:50.768 --> 00:52.572
‐No.
‐Did you still want to do that?

00:52.606 --> 00:54.509
‐You still want to do...
That's not gonna happen.
‐Oh, no!

00:54.543 --> 00:55.511
Oh, goddamn you.

00:55.545 --> 00:57.481
You're not gonna be able to walk
back to the city

00:57.515 --> 00:58.551
'cause we're way out in the...

01:02.592 --> 01:05.330
What? No!

01:05.364 --> 01:09.372
Oh, goddamn it!

01:13.313 --> 01:14.282
♪ Hey! ♪

01:35.792 --> 01:37.829
I cannot believe you guys
did this to me.

01:37.862 --> 01:40.501
Dee, can you please be grateful
about this experience?

01:40.535 --> 01:42.639
I mean, take it in, will you?
Uh, here we are.

01:42.672 --> 01:44.576
We're‐we're in
this charming little pub.

01:44.610 --> 01:47.247
You can smell fresh peat grass
burning in the fireplace.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.618
You know, well,
along with the, uh,

01:48.651 --> 01:49.753
the evidence of Frank's
involvement

01:49.786 --> 01:51.890
‐in a sex trafficking ring.
‐Alleged.

01:51.924 --> 01:53.761
Yeah, Dee, look,
you got to embrace this.

01:53.794 --> 01:55.497
You know?
All you're doing is complaining.

01:55.531 --> 01:58.236
This place is amazing.

01:58.269 --> 01:59.305
With the exception
of all the sheep wool.

01:59.338 --> 02:00.842
Is that bothering anybody else?

02:00.875 --> 02:02.746
No, because we don't have COVID
like you do.

02:02.779 --> 02:04.850
‐You're sick.
‐No, I don't have COVID.

02:04.883 --> 02:06.319
Even the beer here sucks.

02:06.352 --> 02:07.388
Will you look at this?
It's all foam.

02:07.421 --> 02:09.392
What are you doing?

02:09.425 --> 02:11.597
Oh. Sorry.

02:11.630 --> 02:12.732
We‐we run our own bar,

02:12.766 --> 02:14.703
‐so I forget and sometimes
I serve myself.
‐Huh.

02:14.736 --> 02:16.005
‐I'm just gonna squeak by you.
‐Hmm.

02:16.039 --> 02:18.376
Actually, while I got you here,
pal, can I ask you a question?

02:18.410 --> 02:20.147
Do you know a fella
in this town,

02:20.180 --> 02:21.750
goes by the name
of Shelley Kelly?

02:21.784 --> 02:22.852
Yeah, everybody knows him.

02:22.886 --> 02:25.424
He's the, uh, local,
uh, cheesemonger.

02:25.457 --> 02:26.694
Oh...

02:26.727 --> 02:29.298
H‐He's the, uh...
cheese mongrel. Wow.

02:29.332 --> 02:30.702
I did not know he was a mongrel.

02:30.735 --> 02:31.770
Um, how severe is it?

02:31.804 --> 02:33.941
Can‐can he walk?
Does he drool, or...

02:33.974 --> 02:36.613
‐Monger, Charlie. Cheesemonger.
‐Cheesemonger.

02:36.647 --> 02:38.416
Mon... Cheese...
Why are you saying it that way?

02:38.450 --> 02:40.621
Is he a mongrel or a monster?
That's all I want to know.

02:40.655 --> 02:42.692
‐I wonder if he's cute.
‐Who?

02:42.726 --> 02:43.894
Your brother,
the cheese monster.

02:43.928 --> 02:45.631
Do not have sex
with my brother, Mac.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.602
You know,
when I was Irish first,

02:47.635 --> 02:49.840
then I‐then I wanted to
find out what my heritage was.

02:49.873 --> 02:52.712
But now that I'm gay first,
and that's my identity,

02:52.746 --> 02:54.916
then maybe I should just
be plowing a bunch of dudes,

02:54.950 --> 02:57.221
‐and‐and maybe a bunch of
cheese monsters. I don't know.
‐Aw, come on, man.

02:57.254 --> 02:58.891
‐Stop! Would you just...
‐There's gay or badass.
‐Let it go, Mac!

02:58.924 --> 03:01.262
You need to shut up, okay?

03:01.295 --> 03:02.431
Identity doesn't have to factor

03:02.464 --> 03:04.636
into absolutely
every decision you make.

03:04.669 --> 03:06.439
All right? If a man wants
to stand, he doesn't go,

03:06.472 --> 03:07.742
"Uh, uh, what would
a Dutchman do?

03:07.776 --> 03:09.579
Would a Dutchman stand?" Okay?

03:09.613 --> 03:11.617
And if‐if an Italian wants
to eat a sandwich,

03:11.650 --> 03:13.453
he doesn't go, "I have to eat
plates of spaghetti

03:13.486 --> 03:14.288
because I'm an Italian."

03:14.321 --> 03:16.827
He just eats
the goddamn sandwich.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.496
Okay? Oh, you fool.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.802
If you want to go out and bang
every single guy in Ireland,

03:20.835 --> 03:22.337
just go bang every guy
in Ireland

03:22.371 --> 03:24.341
and forget what your identity
has to do with it.

03:24.375 --> 03:25.912
Or you could just find one guy,

03:25.945 --> 03:27.448
fall in love,
get in a relationship

03:27.481 --> 03:28.383
and shut the hell up about it.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.454
‐Please stop doing that.
‐Oh, come on, man!

03:30.487 --> 03:33.561
If I got to stop mid‐rant every
time I want to order a beer,

03:33.594 --> 03:35.363
i‐it's gonna interrupt my flow.

03:35.397 --> 03:37.468
Right? Why don't you just keep
track of what we're drinking

03:37.502 --> 03:39.238
and charge it to
our individual rooms.

03:39.271 --> 03:40.742
Oh, there's only one room.

03:40.775 --> 03:41.610
‐Hmm?
‐Yeah.

03:41.643 --> 03:43.948
One room? Wha...
How's that gonna work?

03:43.981 --> 03:45.885
‐Nah, that's good.
‐That's good?

03:45.918 --> 03:47.622
All of us crammed in
one wool‐infested room‐‐

03:47.655 --> 03:48.591
that sounds good to you?

03:48.624 --> 03:50.928
You want an authentic
European experience.

03:50.962 --> 03:52.264
‐That's what it is.
‐Well, no, that...

03:52.297 --> 03:53.199
That's too authentic, okay?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.270
I'm not‐I'm not...
I'm not staying here.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.507
I'm gonna rent a castle.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.611
‐
‐Well, wait for me.
I'm not staying, either.

03:58.644 --> 04:00.648
I'll tell you what, I'm not
paying for this beer, okay?

04:00.681 --> 04:02.886
'Cause you can barely swallow
this sludge.

04:13.339 --> 04:15.545
‐
‐Oh, oh, Dennis, hey.

04:15.578 --> 04:17.448
You should let me do
the talking in there, okay?

04:17.481 --> 04:19.452
‐Why?
‐Why?

04:19.485 --> 04:20.555
'Cause if you cough in there,
they're not gonna rent us

04:20.588 --> 04:22.592
the castle 'cause they're
gonna know you have COVID.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.462
Dee, you bitch.
I don't have COVID.

04:24.495 --> 04:26.399
Okay? I'm not gonna
cough in there.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.470
You‐you think I can't
pinch off a cough?

04:28.504 --> 04:29.973
I will do the talking.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.319
Oh.
Hi there.

04:36.352 --> 04:37.989
‐
‐Beautiful day, isn't it? Huh?

04:38.022 --> 04:39.158
G‐Grand, as you say.

04:39.191 --> 04:42.464
I think what they say
is, "Top o' the mornin'."

04:42.498 --> 04:43.601
Ah, that's a stereotype. Yeah.

04:43.634 --> 04:46.640
Excuse my sister, she's, uh,
not very good at talking.

04:46.673 --> 04:50.882
Um, so we're actually here
looking f...

04:52.384 --> 04:54.088
‐
‐Uh‐oh.

04:54.121 --> 04:55.490
Oh, gosh.

04:55.525 --> 04:57.094
You okay there, Dennis?

04:59.098 --> 05:01.302
‐Uh, ah...
‐

05:01.335 --> 05:02.505
Huh. Looks like I'll be doing
the talking.

05:02.539 --> 05:05.410
‐No.
‐Uh, we would be looking
for a castle,

05:05.443 --> 05:07.749
and we are very interested
in modern amenities, please.

05:07.782 --> 05:11.389
You know, your thermostats and
your remotes and shit like that.

05:11.422 --> 05:13.393
Ar‐Are you jotting
any of this down?

05:13.426 --> 05:15.430
‐
‐Yeah, yeah, right. So... Sorry.

05:15.463 --> 05:17.100
You caught me
a little off guard, is all.

05:17.134 --> 05:18.571
So, you're‐you're looking
for a castle?

05:18.604 --> 05:20.641
‐
‐Mm. Mm‐hmm.

05:20.675 --> 05:23.012
‐
‐Is he all right?

05:23.046 --> 05:25.350
Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.

05:25.383 --> 05:26.452
Yeah, he's okay.

05:26.485 --> 05:28.657
Well, yes and no.

05:28.691 --> 05:32.030
‐You know what it is?
He's a mongrel.
‐

05:32.064 --> 05:33.499
No.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.703
And that's why I've always
been the talker.

05:34.736 --> 05:36.540
‐ Bitch. Bitch.
‐Oh, boy, did you head that?

05:36.573 --> 05:38.611
‐Yep, here‐here he goes.
Here he goes.
‐

05:38.644 --> 05:40.815
We have to keep him
in the basement in America,

05:40.848 --> 05:45.457
'cause one of his ticks is that
he brutally masturbates himself.

05:45.490 --> 05:47.494
‐ No, no.
‐Oh, yeah.

05:47.529 --> 05:49.533
‐Yeah, he‐he does
a real number on it.
‐

05:49.566 --> 05:51.469
Yeah.
He‐he's shredded it down

05:51.503 --> 05:53.507
‐to a little tiny nub
at this point.
‐No!

05:53.541 --> 05:54.475
Is what it is.
No, no. He's saying,

05:54.509 --> 05:56.780
"Down there,
there's barely anything left."

05:56.813 --> 05:58.584
‐ Damn it!
‐That's what he's saying.

05:58.617 --> 06:00.120
There's nothing left down there.

06:00.153 --> 06:02.491
‐
‐Yeah, so, um,

06:02.525 --> 06:04.963
I don't see you doing
a lot of castle searching.

06:14.516 --> 06:15.618
Bitch.

06:15.651 --> 06:18.122
He's also allergic to sheep.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.538
Go on, go on, out.

06:25.571 --> 06:28.510
Get out, you bastards!

06:28.544 --> 06:30.648
‐Out.
‐Hello, sir?

06:30.681 --> 06:33.453
Oh, sorry.
I was, uh...

06:33.486 --> 06:34.823
Just bashing some rats.

06:34.856 --> 06:36.693
I get it. It's cool.
Don't worry about it.

06:36.727 --> 06:39.064
I bash a lot of rats
in my business, too.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.233
And‐and rats love cheese,

06:40.267 --> 06:41.369
‐so I imagine y‐you get
a lot of 'em here.
‐

06:41.402 --> 06:44.041
‐This is, like,
the place for rats.
‐Yeah, yeah.

06:44.074 --> 06:45.477
Well, how can I help you?

06:45.511 --> 06:47.649
Uh, right, well,
uh, I'm looking for, uh,

06:47.682 --> 06:50.186
a young man named Shelley Kelly.
Is he around?

06:50.220 --> 06:53.159
I'm Shelley Kelly.
Who's asking?

06:53.192 --> 06:55.130
Oh. I'm sorry. I...

06:55.163 --> 06:56.667
I'm looking for a‐a younger man.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.069
Uh, I'm looking for
the young Shelley Kelly.

06:58.102 --> 06:59.639
Is he around?

07:00.641 --> 07:02.477
Hey, do you‐you mind if I sample
some of your jellies?

07:02.512 --> 07:04.582
‐Oh, no. Go on. Help yourself.
‐Ah.

07:04.616 --> 07:06.586
‐
‐Delightful.

07:06.620 --> 07:07.755
Well, I'm...

07:07.789 --> 07:11.162
I'm the only Shelley Kelly
around here that I know of.

07:11.195 --> 07:13.166
‐Uh...
‐Ooh.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.738
This is the tits right here.

07:15.771 --> 07:17.775
‐
‐Yeah, no, that...
that doesn't make sense.

07:17.809 --> 07:20.615
See‐see, Shelley Kelly
is a‐is a kid like me.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.050
Uh, we're pen pals.

07:22.084 --> 07:25.156
Sweet Jesus.

07:25.190 --> 07:26.225
Charlie?

07:26.258 --> 07:28.496
Ugh. That's a miss.

07:28.530 --> 07:29.699
It's got something in it
like sand.

07:29.733 --> 07:32.237
It's full of sand.
Ech.

07:32.270 --> 07:33.641
Yeah, I... I'm Charlie.

07:33.674 --> 07:35.176
Mmm. I know what it is.

07:35.210 --> 07:36.212
It's seeds.

07:36.245 --> 07:37.548
Is there seeds in it?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.084
And there's too many of 'em.

07:39.719 --> 07:41.990
There's a lot of seeds.

08:13.319 --> 08:15.624
It was a bad one.

08:15.658 --> 08:16.793
That's buried in there.

08:16.827 --> 08:19.933
That's gonna be in there
all week. Oh, God.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.104
What'd I miss?

08:26.178 --> 08:28.984
‐(orga

08:29.018 --> 08:31.690
Oh, Father, Father, Father,
I've got news.

08:31.723 --> 08:33.026
I've got wonderful news.

08:33.059 --> 08:36.700
Okay, so, I used to be Irish,

08:36.733 --> 08:37.902
and now I'm Dutch.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.839
Of course, I was badass
the entire time,

08:39.873 --> 08:40.975
but when you surround yourself

08:41.008 --> 08:42.845
with people who aren't
as badass as you,

08:42.879 --> 08:44.114
that tends to be
quite isolating.

08:44.148 --> 08:47.154
The point is I was confused.

08:47.187 --> 08:49.291
To be honest with you, I wanted
to run through a bunch of pipe,

08:49.324 --> 08:51.863
if you know what I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

08:51.897 --> 08:54.034
But then I decided,
you know what?

08:54.068 --> 08:56.973
I only want
one man inside of me.

08:57.007 --> 08:59.111
The Big Man.
The Big Man upstairs.

08:59.144 --> 09:01.550
The only man
that can fill me up.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.021
Well, and his son.
And the Holy Spirit.

09:04.054 --> 09:05.791
I'll take all three of them
at once.

09:05.825 --> 09:06.993
I've done that before.

09:07.027 --> 09:09.131
That was more in a physical
sense, not a spiritual one.

09:09.164 --> 09:11.870
And believe me, it was messy.

09:11.903 --> 09:13.206
Totally worth it, though.
I loved it.

09:13.239 --> 09:16.045
Either way, Father,
what I have decided is that

09:16.078 --> 09:19.017
the most important aspect
of my identity‐‐

09:19.051 --> 09:20.019
it's not being gay.

09:20.053 --> 09:22.892
It's not being Irish.
It's not being badass.

09:22.925 --> 09:24.896
It's being Catholic.

09:24.929 --> 09:27.067
Therefore, I want to become

09:27.100 --> 09:29.639
a Catholic priest!

09:30.039 --> 09:34.281
‐Well, that's nice to hear.
‐

09:34.314 --> 09:38.624
But perhaps we could talk
at a more appropriate time.

09:41.663 --> 09:42.899
Oh.

09:42.932 --> 09:44.234
Uh... Yeah. Sorry.
Sorry, everybody.

09:44.268 --> 09:45.971
I'll just get
in the back of the line,

09:46.005 --> 09:47.040
and then, uh, get the cracker,

09:47.073 --> 09:48.777
and then we'll talk later.

09:48.811 --> 09:49.913
Okay.

09:51.950 --> 09:54.923
Oh, goddamn it,
what the hell is this?

09:54.956 --> 09:56.927
That realtor screwed us.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.162
Probably because
you caused a scene.

09:58.196 --> 10:01.268
What are you talking about, Dee?
This‐this place is amazing.

10:01.302 --> 10:03.039
I mean, I saw
an old bell tower outside

10:03.072 --> 10:04.909
and what I think
used to be a moat.

10:04.943 --> 10:06.112
Okay, this place is perfect.

10:06.145 --> 10:08.049
‐
‐This place is not perfect.

10:08.082 --> 10:09.318
It's a ruin.
We can't sleep here.

10:09.351 --> 10:12.090
Wh... Dee, I'm sure
there's, like, a furnished area

10:12.124 --> 10:14.929
with, like, bedrooms and shit
somewhere. I mean, what, do you,

10:14.963 --> 10:15.798
what, do you want
to walk into a castle...

10:15.831 --> 10:17.234
and have it feel like a Hyatt?

10:17.267 --> 10:19.104
I mean, where's the charm
in that?

10:19.138 --> 10:21.977
Whoa.
This place has a dark past.

10:22.010 --> 10:24.214
Murder, betrayal, beheadings.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.252
Well, you know,
it's a castle, Dee.

10:26.285 --> 10:28.356
You know, people were going
crazy in castles all the time.

10:28.389 --> 10:30.293
And beheading people‐‐
well, that‐that was just

10:30.326 --> 10:33.099
their way of solving problems
back then, you know.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.936
That's tenth century
charm for you.

10:34.969 --> 10:36.071
‐
‐Yeah.

10:36.105 --> 10:38.242
Yeah, this was in 2008.

10:38.276 --> 10:40.948
‐Two... What?
‐Yeah. A mother

10:40.981 --> 10:43.252
went insane and beheaded
all four children.

10:43.286 --> 10:46.225
‐Just chopped their heads
right off.
‐Well, that‐that is...

10:46.258 --> 10:48.229
‐that's decidedly
less charming, isn't it?
‐It's a little less charming.

10:48.262 --> 10:50.233
I'm not sleeping here, Dennis.
It's very creepy.

10:50.266 --> 10:52.037
No, Dee. This is gonna be great.
Trust me.

10:52.070 --> 10:53.105
This is gon‐this is gonna
be awesome, okay?

10:53.139 --> 10:53.974
Just...

10:54.007 --> 10:55.978
I don't care for
all the sheep, though.

10:56.011 --> 10:57.047
That's‐that's my only thing.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.082
All... all what sheep?

10:58.115 --> 11:00.420
‐We haven't seen a sheep.
‐The sheep, the sheep.

11:00.453 --> 11:02.290
I‐I'm sure they've been
passing through, and that's...

11:02.324 --> 11:04.027
Thr... They've been passing
through the... into the castle?

11:04.061 --> 11:05.998
Well, why else would
I be coughing and wheezing?

11:06.031 --> 11:07.902
You have COVID.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.238
To Charlie, my son.

11:09.271 --> 11:12.745
To the dad I didn't know I had.

11:14.949 --> 11:15.918
Well, I'm just sorry that

11:15.951 --> 11:18.790
I didn't get a chance
to see you growing up.

11:18.824 --> 11:19.859
‐Yeah.
‐Mm‐hmm.

11:19.893 --> 11:21.061
And for what it's worth,

11:21.095 --> 11:22.999
I did love your mother.

11:23.032 --> 11:24.434
So did I.

11:24.969 --> 11:26.005
We all did.

11:26.038 --> 11:27.073
A wonderful woman.

11:27.107 --> 11:28.209
I banged her, too.

11:28.242 --> 11:30.915
All right, well, Mom got around.

11:30.948 --> 11:32.183
Well, yeah.

11:32.217 --> 11:34.187
Hey, this is jammed in there.

11:34.221 --> 11:36.191
What do you call it?
What is that?

11:36.225 --> 11:37.127
A lingonberry seed or something?

11:37.160 --> 11:39.197
The important thing
is you're here now.

11:39.231 --> 11:41.235
‐Yeah. Yeah.
‐Yeah. And I don't want to waste
any more time.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.072
No, neither do I.
I mean, God, I've...

11:43.105 --> 11:45.143
I've always had
so many questions, you know?

11:45.176 --> 11:47.949
About who I am
and where I come from.

11:47.982 --> 11:50.019
‐
‐And my‐my...

11:50.053 --> 11:52.424
My‐my family heritage,
and‐and, uh...

11:52.457 --> 11:54.294
‐
‐You know, it's good to have
some truth about...

11:54.328 --> 11:56.031
Will you stop?!
You're just...

11:56.065 --> 11:57.167
You're sucking
and slurping away.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.202
I'm trying to have
a conversation

11:58.236 --> 12:00.340
‐with my father.
‐It's jammed in there, Charlie.

12:00.373 --> 12:02.210
‐I don't care,
go to the bathroom...
‐I can't get it out.

12:02.244 --> 12:03.346
‐I'm gonna need a jackhammer.
‐You're using a screw.

12:03.379 --> 12:06.085
You're embarrassing me
in front of my dad here, man.

12:06.118 --> 12:07.220
Sorry about him.

12:07.254 --> 12:10.928
Charlie, I'm just glad

13:34.461 --> 13:38.169
Walking this path
is a serious commitment.

13:38.202 --> 13:40.541
One that requires
considerable training.

13:40.574 --> 13:44.314
Oh, Father, look, I‐I've been
S'ing and F'ing

13:44.348 --> 13:46.318
my way through life
for far too long.

13:46.352 --> 13:49.024
I think it's time that
I started sucking down

13:49.057 --> 13:49.959
the words of the Bible.

13:49.992 --> 13:52.197
And instead of looking for
pieces of ass,

13:52.230 --> 13:53.265
I'd just look for peace.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.403
Well, your language
leaves a bit to be desired,

13:55.436 --> 13:59.011
but your heart's
in the right place.

13:59.044 --> 14:00.446
I think.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.555
So, to truly understand
what this life is like,

14:04.589 --> 14:08.329
you need to spend some time
with someone who's living it.

I‐I'm gonna be alone
in the seminary

14:54.287 --> 14:55.389
with him, in the rectory?

14:55.423 --> 14:57.393
I mean, these are very
triggering words.

14:57.427 --> 14:59.431
I will S and F him
into oblivion.

14:59.464 --> 15:01.936
I mean, he looks like
Paul Bunyan.

15:01.970 --> 15:05.209
I need more of, like, a...
Elmer Fudd. You got any Fudds?

15:05.243 --> 15:06.679
Let me take a look.

15:06.713 --> 15:09.117
Oh, yeah. What about this guy?
What's his story?

15:09.151 --> 15:10.353
Gus?

15:10.386 --> 15:13.225
Gus? Yeah, I ain't
falling in love with Gus.

15:13.259 --> 15:15.229
Gimme him.

15:15.263 --> 15:17.033
Sure.

15:23.547 --> 15:27.253
See, Dee?
The bedroom's perfect.

15:30.326 --> 15:32.531
Dude, I think
you need a ventilator.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.136
I just need
a good night's sleep.

15:36.305 --> 15:38.008
Just go to bed.

15:44.488 --> 15:46.526
I agree with you, I just...

15:46.559 --> 15:49.030
Well, I don't know
what to do with her.

15:52.303 --> 15:56.145
‐What?
‐What?

15:56.178 --> 15:58.349
Who you talking to?

15:58.382 --> 16:01.155
Nobody.
You're hearing things Dee.

16:02.290 --> 16:05.463
I think what I'm hearing
is fluid fill up your lungs.

16:05.496 --> 16:10.006
Dee, just go to bed.

16:10.039 --> 16:12.043
Okay.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.594
It has to be tonight?

16:20.627 --> 16:23.065
Okay, Dennis,
I don't like that.

16:23.098 --> 16:24.234
I don't like it.

16:24.267 --> 16:29.211
I'm not even talking to you.
I'm talking to the castle.

16:29.244 --> 16:32.150
You're talking to the castle?

16:33.252 --> 16:35.323
I‐Is it talking back?

16:35.356 --> 16:37.460
Dee, just go to bed!

16:46.278 --> 16:49.317
It's the hair, by the way.

16:49.351 --> 16:50.721
Okay, n...

16:50.754 --> 16:54.194
right now, are you
talking to me or the castle?

16:54.227 --> 16:55.731
You.

16:55.764 --> 16:59.337
We were talking about
beheadings earlier.

16:59.371 --> 17:03.479
‐It's the hair.
‐What's the hair?

17:03.513 --> 17:06.351
Well, that's the trouble
with heads, isn't it?

17:06.385 --> 17:09.224
The hair's not authentic.

17:09.257 --> 17:10.761
It's... it's been tampered with.

17:10.794 --> 17:15.102
That's why there's no smell.
It's a... it's a lie.

17:16.305 --> 17:18.375
The hair is on the head.

17:18.409 --> 17:20.747
The hair is a lie,
and therefore,

17:20.781 --> 17:24.522
it's better to just
remove the head altogether.

17:24.555 --> 17:26.626
Okay. Okay, Dennis,
you're very, very sick,

17:26.659 --> 17:29.364
‐and you need to go
to the hospital.
‐Silence!

17:34.542 --> 17:37.280
Dee, I can't breathe.
I need to go to the hospital.

17:37.313 --> 17:38.583
Yeah, no shit!

17:38.617 --> 17:40.554
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna call us an ambulance

17:40.587 --> 17:42.257
‐and get us out of here.
‐Yeah.

17:42.290 --> 17:43.560
No, no, my phone's dead.

17:43.593 --> 17:45.664
Oh, there's no electricity
in this goddamn place.

17:45.697 --> 17:47.433
Then go get the car
and drive me.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.536
The car's out of gas.

17:48.570 --> 17:50.306
Then ring the bell!

17:50.339 --> 17:52.277
What bell?

17:52.310 --> 17:53.412
Go to the old bell tower

17:53.445 --> 17:56.418
and ring the goddamn bell,
you bitch!

17:56.451 --> 17:59.558
Oh, God, um...

17:59.592 --> 18:04.535
Goddamn it.
Where's the stupid bell tower?

18:04.568 --> 18:05.671
No. No, no, no, no.

18:05.704 --> 18:07.541
‐
‐Oh, Jesus Christ.

18:07.574 --> 18:09.477
‐
‐Oh!

18:09.512 --> 18:11.315
‐Oh... Oh!
‐

18:11.348 --> 18:14.555
Oh, oh, oh...

18:14.588 --> 18:17.628
Aah! Get off me!
Get off me!

18:17.661 --> 18:20.266
Okay...

18:22.571 --> 18:25.544
‐
‐Hello?

18:25.577 --> 18:26.546
Who is that?

18:29.585 --> 18:33.560
Your head is a lie.

18:33.593 --> 18:36.566
Dennis?
What are you doing?

18:36.599 --> 18:39.739
You've tampered with it, and...

18:39.772 --> 18:41.643
we won't stand for it
any longer.

18:41.676 --> 18:46.385
Oh, D... Dennis, this is just
the COVID talking, okay?

18:46.418 --> 18:48.155
You're hallucinating.

18:48.657 --> 18:51.294
I don't have COVID.

18:59.344 --> 19:00.614
No, Dennis, please.

19:00.647 --> 19:03.720
Please, Dennis, it's me.
Snap out of it.

19:03.753 --> 19:04.855
‐

19:04.889 --> 19:07.226
Off with her head!

19:13.606 --> 19:14.742
‐And that's the house.
‐Wow.

19:14.775 --> 19:16.879
‐This place is charming as shit.
‐Yeah.

19:16.913 --> 19:19.451
Dennis would be creaming
in his pants if he saw this.

19:19.484 --> 19:20.620
Right, well, uh,
language, Frank,

19:20.654 --> 19:23.359
‐you know, 'cause
we're guests, so, yeah.
‐Oh, yeah.

19:23.392 --> 19:24.427
It's a lovely home.

19:24.461 --> 19:27.634
Uh, are you sure okay
with us staying the night?

19:27.668 --> 19:29.605
Oh, I insist.
Yeah.

19:29.638 --> 19:31.441
I have a spare room
down the hall,

19:31.475 --> 19:33.345
and, uh, I set up a cot
for you there.

19:33.379 --> 19:35.483
Oh, well, we'll take the cot.

19:35.517 --> 19:37.721
Y... You'll both
sleep on the cot?

19:37.755 --> 19:42.531
Uh, I think I'd rather
take the bedroom, Frank.

19:42.564 --> 19:44.769
Won't you get lonely in there?
What if it gets cold?

19:44.802 --> 19:46.471
Oh, there are plenty
of blankets.

19:46.506 --> 19:47.407
What if I poop the bed?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.512
Who's gonna be in there
to laugh with me?

19:49.545 --> 19:51.649
‐What? You might shit the bed?
‐No, no, no.

19:51.682 --> 19:53.520
If that's the case,
I have other sheets.

19:53.553 --> 19:54.889
‐No, no, no, he won't.
‐One time.

19:54.922 --> 19:57.561
‐It was fun...
‐There was a one‐time incident,

19:57.594 --> 19:58.763
‐It was a fun thing.
‐and it was a joke,

19:58.797 --> 20:00.433
and it really
wasn't that funny, so...

20:00.466 --> 20:01.936
‐It wasn't?
‐Uh, no.

20:01.969 --> 20:04.742
‐I thought you thought
it was funny.
‐Nope.

20:04.775 --> 20:07.280
Well, uh, I'm heading off.

20:07.313 --> 20:08.516
Yeah. Sounds good.

20:08.550 --> 20:10.654
‐Good night.
‐Yeah, yeah.

20:10.687 --> 20:14.360
Hey, um, good night...

20:15.396 --> 20:16.632
...Dad.

20:16.666 --> 20:20.206
Oh.
Good night, son.

20:27.588 --> 20:30.660
‐Oh, seed! I got you.
‐Yeah?

20:30.694 --> 20:32.664
I found you, seed.
Look at it.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.935
‐I coughed it out.
‐Yeah. Gross. Yeah.

20:34.969 --> 20:38.543
Oh. I thought
you'd be happy for me.

20:38.576 --> 20:41.649
Uh, sure, I guess.
Sure.

20:41.682 --> 20:44.688
Oh.
I should eat it again.

20:44.722 --> 20:47.694
Then it would be funny 'cause
I didn't learn my lesson.

20:47.728 --> 20:48.830
No, that wouldn't be funny.

20:48.863 --> 20:50.600
It'd just be kind of dumb,
you know.

20:50.634 --> 20:53.439
Oh.

20:53.472 --> 20:55.744
Um...

20:55.777 --> 20:57.815
I think‐I think
I'm gonna go to bed.

20:57.848 --> 20:59.618
‐All right.
‐Yeah.

20:59.652 --> 21:00.887
‐Uh...
‐So you're gonna
stay in the room?

21:00.921 --> 21:02.858
‐Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed
in here and...
‐I‐I'll stay...

21:02.891 --> 21:05.429
‐I'll stay on the...
I'll stay on the...
‐All right.

21:05.463 --> 21:07.601
Good night, Frank.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.304
Good night, Charlie.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.302
Good night, Charlie.
