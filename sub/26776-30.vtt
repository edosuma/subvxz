19:44.116 --> 19:45.918
- No pointing...

19:45.984 --> 19:48.554
- You know what,
I am done with these chips.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.788
But whatever to do
with the bag?

19:49.855 --> 19:51.189
- Okay, okay, come on, guys.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.958
- Yeah, I don't see
a trash can anywhere...

19:53.025 --> 19:55.460
- I don't see one.
- It's... right... there...

19:55.527 --> 19:59.898
- Oh. So it is.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.266
- I think I might just...
maybe just...

20:01.333 --> 20:02.534
Just drop that...right there.

20:02.601 --> 20:06.204
[ nervous laugh ]
- THAT'S IT!

20:06.271 --> 20:08.473
- Ooooooh, inside voice please.

20:08.540 --> 20:14.346
- NO MORE MISTER...
WALLABEE!

20:14.413 --> 20:16.615
- It's Mr. Nice Guy!

20:16.682 --> 20:19.985
- That's right, PASCAL!

20:20.052 --> 20:21.587
I've been trying to teach
you people

20:21.653 --> 20:24.856
manners for years
but none of you listen!

20:24.923 --> 20:28.160
So now I'm going to
make you behave!

20:28.226 --> 20:31.930
- Not anymore, pal!
- Yeah! You're goin' to jail.

20:31.997 --> 20:34.333
And can I just say?
Good plan, dude.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.001
- Thanks.
- Respect.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.470
- Now let's take this guy
down to--

20:38.537 --> 20:41.139
- Ohhhhhh!

20:43.875 --> 20:46.712
- Come on. You want a piece
of Wallabee?

20:46.778 --> 20:49.915
- Yo, Mr. Wallabee is jacked.

20:49.982 --> 20:54.419
- Right?
You know what this means?

20:54.486 --> 20:55.854
[ in unison ]
- LASER PARTY!!

20:55.921 --> 20:58.123
[ Wallabee Wascals cheer ]

21:05.697 --> 21:09.434
- Yay!

21:09.501 --> 21:11.303
Yay!

21:13.538 --> 21:15.941
- Nice job, Kid Danger.
- You too, Cap.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.676
- Y'know, this one had
a nice little ending to it.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.011
- It sure did.

21:19.077 --> 21:20.979
- Just like the ending
of Battle Pigs...

21:21.046 --> 21:23.749
- He hasn't seen that movie yet,
so no spoilers!

21:23.815 --> 21:25.884
- when you find out
that Trotter and Pigtail

21:25.951 --> 21:28.286
are working for the Russians!

21:28.353 --> 21:29.755
