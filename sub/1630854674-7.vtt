WEBVTT

00:15.015 --> 00:16.494
UNKNOWN TEENAGE GIRL
Will?

00:16.494 --> 00:19.889
Will? We gotta go.

00:19.889 --> 00:20.890
Will!

00:31.901 --> 00:36.079
Betty, don't you look
sophisticated?

00:36.079 --> 00:38.342
I'm a grown man with a small dog
that wears clothes.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.040
Thanks, Nico.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.172
Now, if you don't like
this freeze-dried,

00:42.172 --> 00:45.958
too-damn-expensive lamb formula,
I'm afraid we're out of options.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.090
Betty?

00:47.090 --> 00:48.222
Hey.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.921
Oh, and now you're eating paper.

00:51.921 --> 00:52.922
That's just rude.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.099
What you got here, huh?

00:56.099 --> 00:58.101
What is this?

01:00.060 --> 01:03.280
<i>108,000 over the last 10 years.</i>

01:03.280 --> 01:06.066
<i>Georgia's population would've
been significantly lower</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:08.242
<i>if not for
international migration,</i>

01:08.242 --> 01:10.113
<i>which has added
38,000 to the state.</i>

01:11.332 --> 01:12.898
<i>This program and others like it
are brought to you</i>

01:12.898 --> 01:14.291
<i>by T. Rowe Price.</i>

01:14.291 --> 01:16.119
<i>It's never too early
to start investing</i>

01:16.119 --> 01:17.294
<i>in your child's future.</i>

01:24.127 --> 01:26.303
We've got a problem.

01:26.303 --> 01:27.783
I agree.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.480
We need to talk about
boundaries. Why are you here?

01:29.480 --> 01:31.221
You familiar with
the Confederate Front?

01:31.221 --> 01:33.136
Neo-Nazi wannabes? Sure.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.790
Will you take off
your shoes?

01:34.790 --> 01:37.140
We've been hearing chatter that
they're recruiting more members,

01:37.140 --> 01:39.447
- planning a show of strength.
- Okay.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.231
Now, there's an entire
shipping container of guns

01:41.231 --> 01:42.667
that's gone missing.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.974
Last known location was
Atkins Co. Container Yard.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.323
Almost a million dollars
in assault rifles.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.238
Let me guess.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.327
You got a bad feeling
those two things are connected.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.155
If they stole
those those guns,

01:52.155 --> 01:54.157
they have enough weapons
to support a small militia.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.985
A lot of innocent people
could be getting killed.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.249
Oh, are we hosting brunch,
Amanda?

01:59.249 --> 02:00.598
Shoes.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.168
Oh, no.
Mnh-mnh.

02:05.168 --> 02:06.996
You and I do not drop by
each other's houses.

02:06.996 --> 02:07.997
We're not there yet.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.825
- Oh, I know.
- You're late.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.348
I got here as fast
as I could.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.176
- Do you have any coffee?
- Still brewing in the kitchen.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.309
It's a single serve meant for me
to enjoy in solitude,

02:15.309 --> 02:16.527
- but I guess you can have it.
- Thanks.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.964
Nice place.
I like that worked-on look.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.618
Believe it or not,
it looks better when
you're actually invited.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.185
Why is this happening here?

02:22.185 --> 02:24.274
The shift manager at Atkins
Company is waiting for you.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.493
Her name is Babs.

02:25.493 --> 02:28.017
Oh. Nice of you to give Babs
a heads-up.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.069
I'll go wait in the car.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.431
<i>You've reached
Detective Angie Polaski.</i>

02:50.431 --> 02:51.562

03:19.460 --> 03:23.333

I'll read the map. Teamwork.

03:36.346 --> 03:39.088

Billions of tons of goods

04:01.719 --> 04:03.373
move through
my freight station.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.246
We got a simple but efficient
system for tracking it all.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.466
How long y'all gonna be here?
I got pole-dance class tonight.

04:09.466 --> 04:10.337
Excuse me.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.295
However long it takes, Babs.

04:12.295 --> 04:15.298
- That's all right.
- So should I just pretend

04:15.298 --> 04:16.952
like I didn't see
pregnancy test instructions

04:16.952 --> 04:19.128
on your kitchen counter?

04:19.128 --> 04:20.564
That's exactly
what you should do.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.262
I'm not worried about whatever's
on your kitchen counter.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.741
Do you want to talk about
my Honey Bunches of Oats?

04:23.741 --> 04:26.483
Because we can.

04:26.483 --> 04:29.660
Hey, GBI, this is our terminal
grounds person, Taki Georgiou.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.315
He oversees container
maintenance and inventory.

04:32.315 --> 04:35.144
Looking into that UTL.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.277
- What's UTL?
- Means "unable to locate."

04:37.277 --> 04:39.322
So, missing.
Any thoughts on how it happened?

04:39.322 --> 04:41.977
Here's what I know.
Yesterday, a truck came

04:41.977 --> 04:44.414
with the proper waybill
to pick up the container.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.330
But it wasn't in the yard. UTL.

04:47.330 --> 04:51.116
So how often are containers
from this yard going UTL?

04:51.116 --> 04:54.511
We got 99.9%
location accuracy.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.995
That entry or-- What?

04:59.995 --> 05:01.779
Excuse me, Mr. GBI,

05:01.779 --> 05:03.781
you cannot climb up there
unless you're an employee.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.522
Taki, please get him down.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.350
Hey, step back.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.525
You see this?
You know what it means?

05:08.525 --> 05:10.658
It means you step back.

05:10.658 --> 05:14.357
The 8s on this container.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.533
One of them's rounded,
the other squared.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.191
Somebody altered these numbers.

05:22.191 --> 05:25.368
They're probably tampering
with your waybill system too.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.370
They doctor whatever containers
they want to steal

05:27.370 --> 05:29.459
and then create a waybill
with a matching number.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.375
Then they drove off
like it's a normal pickup.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.246
Unfortunately, Babs,
this wasn't a mistake.

05:34.246 --> 05:35.509
One of your workers
stole the guns

05:35.509 --> 05:37.554
right out from under
your nose.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.513
None of my guys
would do this.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.253
Then maybe it was you.

05:41.253 --> 05:43.604
Either way, we'll still need
a list of all your employees.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.390
Hey, Taki, what are
the containers over there?

05:47.390 --> 05:49.392
Those are just old, damaged.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.872
They call it the graveyard.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.569
Then why does it look
like somebody was just moving

05:52.569 --> 05:53.962
a few of these around?

05:53.962 --> 05:56.399
What does it have to do
with my waybill system?

05:56.399 --> 05:59.054
I'm not sure yet, Babs.
That's why we're walking.

05:59.054 --> 06:02.536
I'll go get a crowbar so we
can open some of these doors.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.407
All right.

06:08.411 --> 06:11.414
No need, Faith.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.068
Come over here.
Take a look.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.551
Looks like someone was trying
to hide more than just numbers.

06:27.691 --> 06:30.390
Geez, he looks so young.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.261
Yes, 20s for sure.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.219
Three shots to the chest,
two to the stomach.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.786
Bing-bing.

06:35.786 --> 06:36.961
Where'd this happen?

06:36.961 --> 06:39.442
Fly Sneaks Store
in Little Five Points.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.704
There was a big sneaker
release there today,

06:40.704 --> 06:43.577
and Roland Wynder here
got jacked for his pair.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.448
Did you catch anything unusual
in the autopsy?

06:45.448 --> 06:47.450
Nope, standard
ammunition rounds.

06:47.450 --> 06:50.540
Nothing notable,
medically speaking.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.107
You're going to have to solve
this one on your own.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.544
Ha ha. We got eyewitnesses
and a straightforward motive.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.633
So we'll clear this fast
and then I'll pick up

06:56.633 --> 07:00.332
a pair of exclusive sneaks
for my kid Max's birthday.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.812
Shop owner's at the station,
ready to give her statement.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.901
We should go.
Thanks, Pete.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.468
So the guy, Roland,
bought the last size 11s

07:05.468 --> 07:07.470
when somebody in a hoodie
came in blasting.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.819
And then what?

07:08.819 --> 07:10.125
He grabbed the sneakers
and took off running.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.822
Anyone you think
might have done this?

07:11.822 --> 07:14.129
Yeah.
I got a guy for you.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.436
He's a sneaker reseller
by the name Pun'kin.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.567
And he was at
your store today?

07:17.567 --> 07:19.264
He sure was, Michael.

07:19.264 --> 07:20.483
He was yelling and screaming

07:20.483 --> 07:22.485
about not winning
our sneaker raffle.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.530
Security had
to throw him out.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.490
Here's his info.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.625
Okay.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.365
- Be right behind you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.759
You know you owe me, right?

07:35.759 --> 07:36.847
Why do you think
I took this case?

07:36.847 --> 07:39.284
I need this solved quick.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.678
I can't have people thinking
my store isn't safe.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.288
We'll get him.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.507
Promise.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.856
You better.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.512
Hey, can you get me
in there next?

07:49.512 --> 07:50.948
I gotta get on with my day.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.516
I promise you, we are moving
as fast as we can.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.865
Well, I saw the whole thing.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.520
- You don't say?
- Yeah. Jerry Kilargis.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.653
I own the record store across
the street, Wax 'N' Facts.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.045
Okay, what did you see?

08:01.045 --> 08:02.394
Couldn't really make him out
with that hoodie up,

08:02.394 --> 08:05.310
but I will say I watch
the fancy foot traffic

08:05.310 --> 08:06.616
lined up outside that store,

08:06.616 --> 08:08.531
and what struck me about
the shooter is he had on

08:08.531 --> 08:10.620
the most basic sneakers
I've ever seen.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.666
Reminded me of Bobos
back in the day.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.319
You remember
those cheap tennis shoes?

08:14.319 --> 08:16.191
Who wears Bobos
to a "sneaker drop"?

08:16.191 --> 08:18.715
Yeah.
Uh, Detective Ormewood,

08:18.715 --> 08:20.369
this is Jerry Kilargis.

08:20.369 --> 08:23.677
He said that he saw the suspect
run off in a pair of Bobos.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.505
That's fun. Should we go
check on this Pun'kin guy?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.637
So I'm good to go?
You don't need me anymore?

08:27.637 --> 08:29.639
Sure.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.728
We know where to find you.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.556
Victim's name is Jed Pipski,

08:33.556 --> 08:34.818
logistics coordinator.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.646
Any connection
to the Confederate Front?

08:36.646 --> 08:38.866
Not that I found,
but DFI dug up

08:38.866 --> 08:40.520
something interesting
on his phone.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.653
He was making an unusual
amount of calls to Babs.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.699
Babs neglected to tell us

08:45.699 --> 08:47.352
he hadn't even shown up
to work for three days.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.920
Mm.
I knew I liked her for this.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.012
Shot in the dark--
are you worried

08:55.012 --> 08:56.666
about the pregnancy test?

08:56.666 --> 08:57.711
And I still don't want
to talk about it.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.365
Let's bring in Babs.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.585
Okay.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.588
How's everyone holding up
with the news of Jed's death?

09:05.588 --> 09:07.590
It's pretty rough.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.766
We're like a family
down at the station.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.682
Everybody is going to The Truck
Stop tonight to toast to Jed.

09:12.682 --> 09:13.814
The Truck Stop?

09:13.814 --> 09:15.555
It's a bar
across from the station.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.733
Jed'd be sad to miss it.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.778
You and Jed were close.

09:21.778 --> 09:26.435
Jed was the best logistics
coordinator alive.

09:26.435 --> 09:27.610
Is that why you two would call
each other

09:27.610 --> 09:29.046
at all hours of the night?

09:30.918 --> 09:32.789
It's the nature
of the business.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.399
Or maybe the two of you
were working together,

09:34.399 --> 09:38.403
- boosting containers.
- What? No.

09:42.712 --> 09:47.412
Our relationship wasn't
always about work.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.416
Jed and I were having
an affair.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.983
- What?!
- Are you kidding me, Babs?

09:52.983 --> 09:54.637
We were going to find out.
Why wouldn't you tell us that?

09:54.637 --> 09:56.726
Yeah, sure, just air out
my dirty laundry.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.772
I'm sure Human Resources
would love that.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.425
Not to mention my husband.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.471
- When was the last time?
- Three nights ago.

10:02.471 --> 10:03.951
The night he went missing?

10:03.951 --> 10:05.648
Babs, you realize you're
the last known person

10:05.648 --> 10:06.693
to see Jed alive.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.826
- This looks bad for me, huh?
- Oh.

10:09.826 --> 10:12.002
Mostly it looks like you two
were conspiring to steal guns,

10:12.002 --> 10:14.483
and then you took him out,
which ain't good.

10:14.483 --> 10:15.963
I swear that is not
what happened.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.965
Convince me.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.749
Talk to us about
the Confederate Front.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.795
You employ any of them
at the station?

10:21.795 --> 10:23.927
One of the guys,
his name is Craig McDonald.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.668
He's a forklift operator.

10:25.668 --> 10:30.847
He's got this Confederate tattoo
with CF printed on it.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.675
Confederate Front.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.198
Where's Craig right now?

10:34.198 --> 10:36.548
He's off today, but I can
tell you where he'll be tonight.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.814
Truck Stop.
Jed's wake.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.643
I ain't kill nobody.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.557
I wasn't even at that
wack-ass store, bro.

10:45.557 --> 10:47.168
That's not what I heard.

10:47.168 --> 10:50.780
We got eyewitnesses saying
you caused quite a scene today.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.695
Because their owner
rigs the raffle.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.871
She always gives them
to her peoples first.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.569
I've missed out on the last
five releases because of her.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.484
And that made you
angry, didn't it?

10:59.484 --> 11:01.486
Angry enough to come back
locked and loaded,

11:01.486 --> 11:02.705
'cause you'd do anything
not to miss out.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.533
Y'all not pinning this on me.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.491
I'm telling you,
I ain't kill nobody.

11:06.491 --> 11:07.971
You keep that same energy
in court,

11:07.971 --> 11:09.712
Pun'kin, you might get lucky
with parole in 50 years.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.018
Hey, let me talk
to you a sec.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.895
Yeah, he's already lying.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.681
We got him right where we want
him, scared out of his mind.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.943
Does it bother you

11:22.943 --> 11:24.727
that his shoes don't match
the description

11:24.727 --> 11:25.728
we got from
the record store owner?

11:25.728 --> 11:26.903
Not particularly.

11:26.903 --> 11:27.991
Not when we found
a pair of the size 11

11:27.991 --> 11:29.732
stolen sneakers
in his car, too.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.516
So stop poking holes.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.736
Doing my job
or poking holes?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.607
- Poking holes.
- Yeah.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.741
It turns out
Craig McDonald spent

11:38.741 --> 11:40.395
a little time in
Central State prison

11:40.395 --> 11:41.744
- for burglary.
- That facility is a haven

11:41.744 --> 11:43.050
for known
Confederate members.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.921
Craig's got to be
the connection.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.401
What about Jed?
Do you think he's involved

11:46.401 --> 11:48.882
and things went sideways
or just wrong place, wrong time?

11:48.882 --> 11:50.579
I'd say the latter.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.755
I think after a late-night
rendezvous with Babs,

11:52.755 --> 11:54.888
Jed stumbled upon Craig
changing container numbers.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.193
So bring him in.
What are we waiting on?

11:56.193 --> 11:57.760
Well,
if he's Confederate Front,

11:57.760 --> 11:58.935
there's no way
he's giving them up

11:58.935 --> 12:00.763
unless we have
strong evidence on him.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.026
Our intel says there's
a lot of movement going on

12:03.026 --> 12:04.898
with known Confederates.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.421
Something's in the works.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.771
So whatever you need to find,
find it faster.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.212
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh ♪</i>

12:16.953 --> 12:18.738
<i>♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪</i>

12:18.738 --> 12:19.782
<i>♪ Where my girls at?♪</i>

12:19.782 --> 12:20.957

12:20.957 --> 12:22.785
<i>♪ Well, is you feelin' that?♪</i>

12:22.785 --> 12:25.570
<i>♪ Put one hand up,

12:25.570 --> 12:27.442
<i>♪ Tryin' to take my man,
see, I don't need that ♪</i>

12:27.442 --> 12:29.792
What are you so happy about?

12:29.792 --> 12:33.056
It's the first time
I've been outside of Georgia.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.798
Whoop-de-doo. It's not like
we're going to EPCOT.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.631
We could go to the cops.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.241
They won't do anything.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.808
- They never do.
- You don't know that.

12:45.808 --> 12:48.898
I actually 100% do know that.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.771
He'll just deny it.
And so will his wife.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.990
And then they'll look like these
cute little foster parents

12:53.990 --> 12:55.818
who were nice enough
to take in a teenage slut

12:55.818 --> 12:57.820
who's now
just causing trouble.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.691
He walked into your room
in the middle of the night

12:59.691 --> 13:00.910
and raped you.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.086
Seems like he should have
to pay for that.

13:03.086 --> 13:06.263
You know
he's done it before.

13:06.263 --> 13:09.919
They're going to ask me
what I was wearing

13:09.919 --> 13:11.660
and how many guys
I've slept with.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.966
That's the way
the world works, Will.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.184
Look at your neck.

13:14.184 --> 13:15.838
You tried to report someone

13:15.838 --> 13:17.840
and got thrown
through a plate glass door.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.842
Did they do anything for you
at the hospital?

13:19.842 --> 13:21.626
No.

13:21.626 --> 13:24.847
Okay.
Then let's not report him.

13:24.847 --> 13:25.935
I'll kill him myself.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.111
Oh, my God.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.852
Pull over.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.114
Right now!

13:31.114 --> 13:32.942
Where are you going,
mental patient?

13:32.942 --> 13:34.291
Mental patient?

13:34.291 --> 13:36.032
You're the one
that's delusional.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.860
You're going to throw your life
away for that piece of garbage?

13:37.860 --> 13:40.167
God, if anyone's
going to kill him, I will!

13:40.167 --> 13:42.952
Get back in the car!

13:42.952 --> 13:44.867
You're going to walk 100 miles
to get your abortion?

13:44.867 --> 13:46.390
Yes!

13:46.390 --> 13:50.655
Well, watch out for snakes
and alligators and pythons.

13:50.655 --> 13:53.006
Pythons are snakes!

14:18.292 --> 14:20.033
What?

14:20.033 --> 14:22.731
I found the pregnancy test instructions.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.050
Are you late?

14:37.050 --> 14:39.748
No, I'm peeing on sticks
for fun.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.097
So are you...?

14:43.970 --> 14:44.927
Pregnant?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.363
The word is "pregnant."

14:46.363 --> 14:48.278
- Are you pregnant?
- I don't know.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.932
I haven't taken the test yet.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.586
You just said you peed
on a stick.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.588
I-I-I was just saying--

14:53.588 --> 14:55.024
I haven't taken it yet.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.113
Okay, so why don't you
take it now?

14:57.113 --> 14:58.245
Why don't you take it now?

14:58.245 --> 15:00.116
Real mature, Ang.

15:00.116 --> 15:01.944
I don't know what you want
from me.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.121
Will, I'm 62 days sober.

15:05.121 --> 15:07.297
Does that seem like
mother material to you?

15:07.297 --> 15:08.908
This scares me, too.
Okay?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.911
I have no idea what this is,
how this goes.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.957
I'm barely keeping
a Chihuahua alive at home.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.307
But at least we know
what not to do.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.050
And I do think that
you would be a great--

15:21.050 --> 15:22.965
Don't even finish
that sentence.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.314
Oh, my God.

15:24.314 --> 15:27.752
We've been having this argument
for 25 years.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.755
You actually think you can
Etch-A-Sketch things away

15:30.755 --> 15:33.149
and they don't exist anymore.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.238
But I'm still just a junkie
trying to get her life together.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.936
You are not the only one

15:36.936 --> 15:39.155
who's had to drag themselves
out of a hole.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.070
Yeah, well,
I don't even know

15:41.070 --> 15:43.812
if this "maybe baby"
is yours, so...

15:47.642 --> 15:49.992
You make this impossible sometimes.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.954
You know what?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.130
Do whatever you want, Ang.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.495
Where the hell is Polaski?

17:03.370 --> 17:07.243
Everybody throw one
back for Jed!

17:07.243 --> 17:09.071
Yeah, Jed!

17:13.945 --> 17:17.166
There he is,
by the pool table with Taki.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.907
Craig's gonna play coy.
We need to match him.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.343
Subtlety is key.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.084
Just get him talking,
track the holes in his story.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.739
Got it. It's gonna be
a slow burn tonight.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.268
Guess they started throwing them
back earlier than I thought.

17:32.268 --> 17:33.269
Get him out of here!

17:33.269 --> 17:35.184
That's it!

17:35.184 --> 17:36.925
Confederate tat.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.145
- I'll take Taki?
- Mm.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.889
Nothing changes
because of this, all right?

17:44.889 --> 17:47.762
Nothing changes. Okay?
We'll still be in good shape

17:47.762 --> 17:50.112
if we get 'em into Jackson
in the morning.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.113
Craig McDonald?

17:51.113 --> 17:53.289
Special Agent Trent, GBI.

17:53.289 --> 17:54.290
I have a few questions.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.900
What kind of questions?

17:55.900 --> 17:57.119
Oh, I don't know.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.208
Let's start with an easy one.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.905
What's in Jackson?

18:00.905 --> 18:03.473
That's the wrong question, GBI.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.392
All right.
Why don't we, uh--

18:09.392 --> 18:10.915
why don't we go take a walk,
Craig, huh?

18:10.915 --> 18:13.135
It's getting
a little crowded.

18:13.135 --> 18:16.269
I don't think you understand
who you're talking to.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.935
Hey, spread out!
He won't get far.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.155
Go left, go left!

18:33.155 --> 18:34.983
You go that way.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.129
Check over here.
Gotta be somewhere.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.526
- Come on!
- Go! Go!

18:56.526 --> 18:58.267
Come on!

19:03.185 --> 19:07.624
- Could be anywhere!
- Gotta be here.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.192
Come on.
He'll have backup coming.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.367
Let's go!

19:11.367 --> 19:14.196
All right. Come on.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.415
Let's head out.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.244
Well, what do you think?

19:20.071 --> 19:22.378
I don't know...

19:30.604 --> 19:32.388
What's up, Faith?

19:32.388 --> 19:33.998
<i>We got a problem out here.</i>

19:33.998 --> 19:35.652
I can't find Will.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.350
<i>His phone
runs out of battery</i>

19:37.350 --> 19:39.526
because batteries aren't
designed to work for 20 years.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.354
Have you tried talking
to Angie?

19:41.354 --> 19:43.225
<i>It's more serious than that.</i>

19:43.225 --> 19:45.314
I found his gun in front of
the bar we were surveilling.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.403
<i>He was following
a Confederate.</i>

19:47.403 --> 19:49.231
<i>Amanda, there's blood
out here, too.</i>

19:53.192 --> 19:55.237
<i>Hey, I need backup.
Are you listening?</i>

19:57.239 --> 19:59.110
I-I'll have a mobile command
center out there

19:59.110 --> 20:00.764
within the hour.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.418
<i>I'm pulling together whoever's
available to help</i>

20:02.418 --> 20:04.072
<i>- with the search.</i>
- Great. I'll be here.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.335
<i>No. I need you to take the lead
on the missing guns.</i>

20:06.335 --> 20:08.207
Isn't Will more important?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.686
That's why I'm sending
the entire GBI out

20:09.686 --> 20:11.906
to a dive bar called
The Truck Stop.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.256
But if the Confederates
are attacking law enforcement,

20:14.256 --> 20:15.736
they're up to something bad.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.346
<i>That's your assignment,
Agent Mitchell.</i>

20:17.346 --> 20:19.218
<i>Can you handle it?</i>

20:21.132 --> 20:24.092
Yes, ma'am.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.144
Will, you home?

20:37.105 --> 20:39.455
Yeah, feel the same way
about you, you little snitch.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.457
I was just starting
to tolerate you.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.463
I'm going to find some
junk food, not share with you.

20:52.686 --> 20:55.297
All right, let me just--

20:55.297 --> 20:57.430
Let me just talk
before you say anything.

20:59.519 --> 21:02.304
Hi, uh, Amanda?

21:02.304 --> 21:04.741
You're not the last person
in the world

21:04.741 --> 21:08.136
I expected to call me but--
but pretty close to it.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.315
<i>No, I haven't spoken to him
since, um,</i>

21:13.315 --> 21:15.317
<i>he was at the precinct earlier.</i>

21:15.317 --> 21:16.492
<i>How much blood was it?
Do you know that it was his?</i>

21:16.492 --> 21:18.320
We don't know anything
for sure.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.191
All right, I'm on my way.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.324
<i>No, I have
enough manpower here.</i>

21:22.324 --> 21:23.499
Amanda, come on.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.501
They found his gun.

21:25.501 --> 21:28.199
You stay there in case
he comes home.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.505
I'm serious.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.595
He might--
He might need medical attention.

21:35.511 --> 21:39.341
Call me
if you hear anything?

21:39.341 --> 21:41.474
<i>Yeah.
You'll be the first to know.</i>

21:41.474 --> 21:42.518
Okay.

21:47.523 --> 21:52.528
<i>♪ You are tired ♪</i>

21:52.528 --> 21:55.183
I don't know why I told
Will the baby wasn't his.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.533
I don't know why I hurt him
like that.

21:57.533 --> 22:00.362

22:00.362 --> 22:02.233
That's wrong.

22:02.233 --> 22:03.713
I do know.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.499
Because he's going to let me.

22:06.499 --> 22:11.460
<i>♪ Ooh, I've been loving you ♪</i>

22:11.460 --> 22:14.245
Will has always been there.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.512
Always, and no matter how much
I mess up,

22:19.512 --> 22:22.210
he still sees good in me.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.691
I hate it.

22:24.691 --> 22:28.521
I mean, what is he thinking?

22:28.521 --> 22:31.045
Marriage?

22:31.045 --> 22:33.743
Family?

22:33.743 --> 22:37.051
I don't know when the last time
is I-I had a checkup.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.531
Am I really giving
"grown-up" here?

22:38.531 --> 22:41.272

I just want him to come home.

Cross-country skiing.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.723
Have you ever been skiing?

23:40.723 --> 23:42.464
That's not the game
we're playing.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.248
What about you?

23:44.248 --> 23:46.468
Hmm.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.470
I wish being mad
was a sport.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.472
I'd crush that.

Etch-A-Sketch?

24:06.488 --> 24:08.055
You remember.

24:08.055 --> 24:11.145
Just got to shake it really
good to erase what's there.

24:11.145 --> 24:13.756
That's what you do.

24:13.756 --> 24:16.150
You shake it away
and you move on.

24:16.150 --> 24:20.328
Well, we have a lot
of shaking to do, Wilbur.

24:20.328 --> 24:23.287
Hey, no more foster homes
for us, okay?

24:23.287 --> 24:25.594

Hurry up.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.626
Let's go.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.686
Let's go.
We got to keep it moving.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.557
About to do it, boys,
let's go!

25:15.557 --> 25:16.558
Hurry up.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.399
Great.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.928
Hey.

25:38.928 --> 25:42.018
I'm sorry to hear
about Trent, Angie.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.368
Why are you sorry?
We don't know what happened.

25:44.368 --> 25:47.720
No, I know, but he's your guy,
and you're my partner, so.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.592
Jesus, yep, Trent is missing
and he's wonderful.

25:50.592 --> 25:51.767
You're here
and you're awful.

25:51.767 --> 25:52.899
It is what it is.

25:52.899 --> 25:55.597
- Mm.
- I'm sorry.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.947
Seriously, it's been
a long, sleepless night,

25:57.947 --> 26:00.689
and I feel like
the whole department

26:00.689 --> 26:02.473
is waiting for me
to break down.

26:02.473 --> 26:06.782
Only a few.
Don't worry about them.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.044
Hey, Captain Heller.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.438
Hey.
How you holding up, Ang?

26:10.438 --> 26:12.614
- Good.
- Good.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.791
So, uh, what's that
sneaker shooting looking like?

26:15.791 --> 26:17.619
Oh, we put a bow on it
for you, Cap.

26:17.619 --> 26:18.968
Our suspect is being processed
as we speak.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.622
I like to hear it. Good.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.015
Uh, wait.

26:22.015 --> 26:26.454
Um, Jerry Kilargis,
the shop owner across the street

26:26.454 --> 26:28.804
from the murder,
said that he saw the shooter

26:28.804 --> 26:30.893
wearing what were described
as Bobos.

26:30.893 --> 26:32.634
Pun'kin was wearing
a rare pair of Nikes

26:32.634 --> 26:33.766
the day of the shooting.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.637
He could have
changed them.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.770
Yeah, maybe. But, um,
I did some more digging.

26:37.770 --> 26:40.076
I meant to tell you,
but with Will missing

26:40.076 --> 26:42.644
- and everything, uh, sorry.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.646
So what do you got for us, Ang?

26:44.646 --> 26:47.649
So my theory is that
those Bobos the shooter wore

26:47.649 --> 26:50.478
were prison-issued, Georgia
State Penitentiary to be exact.

26:50.478 --> 26:53.481
Pun'kin never did time,
but our victim,

26:53.481 --> 26:55.788
Roland, did a stint
with his friend

26:55.788 --> 26:58.660
Billy Thompson
for aggravated assault.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.531
Roland got out
two years ago.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.924
Billy got out last week.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.491
So you think Roland's friend
is the shooter?

27:03.491 --> 27:06.450
I think he's worth talking to
before we move on Pun'kin.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.930
Yeah, I agree.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.671
It's too weird to be
a coincidence. Go find the guy.

27:11.891 --> 27:12.761
You just go over my head
to the captain

27:12.761 --> 27:14.458
right in front of me?

27:14.458 --> 27:15.677
- What's your problem?
- What is your problem?

27:15.677 --> 27:17.070
You want to send
an innocent man to jail

27:17.070 --> 27:18.549
just so you can get
a hookup with a sneakerhead?

27:18.549 --> 27:19.638
You have no idea what the hell
you're talking about.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.987
Well, then explain it to me.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.684
You've been trying to close this
case since before it started.

27:22.684 --> 27:23.859
We recovered
the stolen sneakers.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.556
We have eyewitness testimony.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.689
From someone who clearly
has something on you.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.560
You think I didn't see that,
Michael?

27:29.560 --> 27:30.953
It's not like that.
Hey, leave it alone, Angie.

27:30.953 --> 27:32.694
I'm not trying to get caught up
in your shady--

27:32.694 --> 27:34.783
Leave it alone!

27:43.836 --> 27:45.185
Leave it alone, Angie.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.547
Where's my partner?

27:59.547 --> 28:00.722
I don't know.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.507
Okay, here's the deal.

28:03.507 --> 28:07.076
We got a dead body and a missing
law enforcement officer.

28:07.076 --> 28:10.732
This is as serious as it gets,
Taki, so you better tell me

28:10.732 --> 28:13.561
<i>where those guns are
and where my partner is.</i>

28:13.561 --> 28:15.737
<i>I don't know anything.</i>

28:15.737 --> 28:17.739
I got you on security cameras

28:17.739 --> 28:20.916
leaving work
the night Jed died.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.179
I checked his schedule.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.704
Your shift ended about
12 hours earlier that day.

28:28.576 --> 28:29.925
Come on, Faith.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.579
Taki, are you stupid?

28:31.579 --> 28:33.189
What do you think
white nationalists are gonna do

28:33.189 --> 28:35.757
with a million dollars'
worth of guns?

28:35.757 --> 28:37.759
Every bullet fired is going
to be on you,

28:37.759 --> 28:39.761
and I got enough to connect you
to the theft of those guns

28:39.761 --> 28:41.632
and to Jed's murder.

28:41.632 --> 28:42.764
And because you're
the only thing we have,

28:42.764 --> 28:44.766
it's all coming down on you.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.420
You're the guy, Taki.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.596
You are going to be the face
of these crimes--

28:48.596 --> 28:51.425
theft, murder, missing law
enforcement officers,

28:51.425 --> 28:53.775
gun violence,
hate crimes, Neo-Nazis.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.778
Taki Georgiou,
you gonna save yourself or not?

28:59.781 --> 29:02.871
Craig and I boosted
the container.

29:02.871 --> 29:04.786
But it was just about
the money.

29:04.786 --> 29:05.874
<i>What about Jed?</i>

29:05.874 --> 29:06.962
<i>Craig, he went nuts</i>

29:06.962 --> 29:08.790
when Jed saw us changing
those numbers,

29:08.790 --> 29:12.794
so he beat him to death.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.928
Straight up, I-- I had no clue
he was some kind of Nazi.

29:15.928 --> 29:18.104
I need a location, Taki.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.802
Where is my partner?

29:20.802 --> 29:23.587
There was a warehouse.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.676
Craig took me to a warehouse
where we met the guy

29:25.676 --> 29:27.113
to give us
our up-front payment.

29:27.113 --> 29:29.768
- Where?
- The address is in my phone.

29:29.768 --> 29:30.986
It was in Jackson.

29:30.986 --> 29:33.815
There you go.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.104
Come on, fellas.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.858
My son loves that game, too.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.164
Hey, hey!

30:18.164 --> 30:20.340
Coming your way,
coming your way!

30:20.340 --> 30:22.124
Get him up.
Get up.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.344
Come on.
Hands behind your back.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.172
Turn him around.
I got him.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.309
Wait a minute.
Half these guns are missing.

30:33.309 --> 30:35.398
Where did the Confederates
take the guns?

30:37.400 --> 30:39.402
You're going to tell me
what I need to know,

30:39.402 --> 30:42.014
and you're going
to tell me now.

30:45.495 --> 30:46.975
Hey!

30:46.975 --> 30:49.021
Stop! Police!

30:51.980 --> 30:53.242
Go!

31:02.208 --> 31:03.209
I didn't do anything.

31:03.209 --> 31:06.342
- Yeah.
- Hey, Billy.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.953
Nice shoes, man.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.389
Didn't know Georgia State
Penitentiary let you keep them.

31:09.389 --> 31:12.348
Hey, hey.

31:12.348 --> 31:14.046
All right.

31:15.482 --> 31:19.399
Scuffed my sneakers.

31:19.399 --> 31:21.575
Occupational hazard, man.

32:00.657 --> 32:03.312
Hey! Listen up.

32:05.271 --> 32:07.273
These are good.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.623
Liberal snowflake politicians
want to take down

32:09.623 --> 32:11.451
a Confederate statue?

32:11.451 --> 32:13.670
Not today, boys.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.977
So grab a gun
and get to know it.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.239
We leave in 20.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.502
Oh, yeah!
That's what's gonna happen!

32:29.338 --> 32:31.471
There you go,
just like that!

32:48.140 --> 32:49.358
Light them boys up!

32:53.014 --> 32:54.494
All right.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.278
I'm running out of moves here.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.456
There's not one pay phone
left in the state of Georgia.

33:00.456 --> 33:02.154
All right, boys.

33:02.154 --> 33:04.547
These guys are about
to send trucks full of guns

33:04.547 --> 33:06.985
and Neo-Nazis
to a peaceful protest.

33:09.596 --> 33:13.339
I gotta try and stop them
with an unloaded rifle.

33:15.819 --> 33:17.082
Whoever's listening to this,
I want you to know

33:17.082 --> 33:20.302
that I know
this is a really stupid idea.

33:22.304 --> 33:28.180
Also, Ang,
I'm sorry we fought.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.358
There's nothing more I'd love
than raising a baby

33:32.358 --> 33:34.186
with the most amazing woman
I've known...

33:36.057 --> 33:38.538
...and the only person
who truly knows me.

33:41.628 --> 33:45.153
I love you.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.373
Please don't take Betty
to the pound.

34:01.778 --> 34:03.215
GBI!

34:03.215 --> 34:04.520
You're under arrest!

34:04.520 --> 34:06.174
- Hey!
- You're all under arrest.

34:06.174 --> 34:07.567
Put down your weapons.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.223
That rifle would be
a lot more dangerous

34:11.223 --> 34:13.181
if you had a clip in it, GBI.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.574
Maybe there's a round
in the chamber.

34:14.574 --> 34:16.532
Don't make your buddy here
find out.

34:16.532 --> 34:18.404
My backup's outside.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.058
Drop your weapons.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.408
Put them down!

34:22.408 --> 34:24.540
What are you doing,
you idiots?!

34:27.413 --> 34:30.546
Should have stayed gone,
Special Agent Trent.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.592
Freeze!

34:35.116 --> 34:37.205
Turn around!
Hands up in front!

34:38.598 --> 34:40.208
Turn around!
Turn around!

34:40.208 --> 34:43.385
We have contact.
We have contact.

35:04.450 --> 35:06.626
What happened?

35:06.626 --> 35:11.152
Doesn't make top 10 worst days
of my life, so who cares?

35:11.152 --> 35:13.633
Looks like you had things
pretty well covered without me.

35:13.633 --> 35:17.593
Yeah, I guess so.

35:17.593 --> 35:18.855
You okay?

35:18.855 --> 35:21.423
- Hey, I need a medic over here!
- I'm okay.

35:21.423 --> 35:22.424
- You sure? Because your head--
- I'm okay.

35:22.424 --> 35:25.471
Okay, good. Good.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.302
He needs a medic!

35:47.841 --> 35:51.149
Amanda, I'll get you
a report as soon as--

35:51.149 --> 35:52.628
What's this?

35:52.628 --> 35:54.848
That's how much the GBI spent
looking for your ass.

35:54.848 --> 35:56.458
Oh, you expect me
to pay this?

35:56.458 --> 35:59.331
No. Just thought you should know
how much it cost us.

35:59.331 --> 36:01.681
Or you want me to know
how much you care.

36:02.725 --> 36:04.553
So what do you think, Amanda?

36:04.553 --> 36:05.511
Can Will get the rest
of the day off?

36:05.511 --> 36:06.773
Why? What's wrong?

36:06.773 --> 36:08.688
A little bump on the head
make you soft, Will?

36:08.688 --> 36:10.255
Please.
I'm fine.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.474
I don't need anything except
this ice pack. What's next?

36:12.474 --> 36:16.304
What's next is that I need you
in my office for a full debrief.

36:16.304 --> 36:18.828
Can't wait.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.507
Hey, Will.

36:54.342 --> 36:56.562
I just want to get out
of here.

36:56.562 --> 36:57.867
Can you drive back?

36:57.867 --> 36:59.869
Of course.

37:02.394 --> 37:04.396
Is that an abortion bear?

37:04.396 --> 37:07.529
They were all out
of abortion giraffes.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.543
I'm glad you're here.

37:21.543 --> 37:24.720
Always.

37:24.720 --> 37:25.765
You know that.

37:43.478 --> 37:44.784
Billy confessed.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.742
He killed Roland.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.657
- He give a motive?
- Yeah.

37:48.657 --> 37:51.399
Roland testified against him
to get early release,

37:51.399 --> 37:52.618
then Billy got out
on appeal.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.402
Oops.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.665
Good instincts, Detective.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.584
I-I wasn't trying to make you
look bad

38:02.584 --> 38:04.630
in front of the captain,

38:04.630 --> 38:07.415
and I appreciate you
checking on me earlier.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.339
A while back,
I got too rough

38:18.339 --> 38:22.300
with a suspect
near Lou Lou's store.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.999
Her, uh, her cameras caught me
beating this guy

38:25.999 --> 38:29.655
after he kneed me
in the groin.

38:29.655 --> 38:34.442
I thought it was a fair trade,
but when I saw the video,

38:34.442 --> 38:38.446
it didn't look too good.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.453
How not good?

38:45.453 --> 38:48.978
Well, Angie, I'm doing favors
for her, so what do you think?

38:52.982 --> 38:55.681
You got something going on, man.

38:55.681 --> 38:56.856
We all do.

38:56.856 --> 38:59.511
Mine's drugs.

39:00.729 --> 39:04.733
Yours is rage, right?

39:11.479 --> 39:15.396
You know, when you get
discharged from the Army

39:15.396 --> 39:18.530
and you go home,

39:18.530 --> 39:22.838
they make you go to these evals
and seminars to manage

39:22.838 --> 39:27.669
the, uh,
"post-combat emotional journey."

39:30.716 --> 39:33.414
Sounds about as cringey
as getting out of rehab.

39:38.114 --> 39:41.901
Look, Ang, whatever this thing
is that I have going on...

39:43.685 --> 39:46.558
I'm doing the work.

39:46.558 --> 39:48.690
It's under control.
