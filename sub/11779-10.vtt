IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

00:12.846 --> 00:15.932
THE COMPETITION
GOT PERSONAL.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.267
- HOW'S IT GOING, KIDDO?

00:17.350 --> 00:19.227
- YOU STEAL MY IDEAS,
I WILL KILL YOU.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.521
- I'D LOVE TO PUT A POUNDING
ON LITTLE SAUSAGE,

00:21.604 --> 00:22.772
SQUASH THAT WIENER.

00:22.856 --> 00:23.815
I GOT A SKULL FOR YOU, MAN.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.608
- YOU KNOW WHAT I DID
WITH THE SKULL

00:25.692 --> 00:26.526
LAST TIME YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.445

IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO...

00:30.113 --> 00:30.905

I DON'T LIKE THAT.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.533
narrator: THE ARTISTS
PAID THE PRICE

00:33.616 --> 00:35.326
FOR SCOTT'S RUTHLESS
SKULL PICKS.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.995
- SCOTT'S GONNA HAVE BULLETS
AIMING AT ME.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.371
- IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.039
- IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT,
OR YOU CAN'T DO IT?

00:40.123 --> 00:42.292
- WE GOT OURSELVES A BITCH,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.420
SCOTT WAS TRYING TO GIVE ME
A DIFFICULT ONE TO DEAL WITH.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.963
HE SUCCEEDED.

TO TAKE DOWN SCOTT.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.929

THAT SCOTT'S BEEN TRACING.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.139
- HE'S SCRAMBLING.
HE'S AT THE END OF HIS ROPE.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.474
- THAT'S NOT
YOUR ORIGINAL ARTWORK.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.475

01:00.518 --> 01:01.269
YOU SHOULD BE COUNTING
YOUR LUCKY STARS.

01:01.352 --> 01:03.146

TO [bleep] HIDE.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.401
MELISSA AND GENTLE JAY
WERE THE BOTTOM TWO.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.528
- MELISSA.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.155
- YOU DID DENT UP HER NOSE
A LITTLE BIT.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.990
THAT'S MAKING HER NOSE
LOOK OFF-CENTERED.

01:14.073 --> 01:14.908
- JAY.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.159

WE'VE SEEN SOME BAD BACKGROUNDS.

NEITHER OF YOU WILL BE

AND AVENGE YOUR DEATH.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.461
- HELL, YEAH.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.546

06:15.875 --> 06:16.876

IS TRADITIONAL TATTOOS

06:16.959 --> 06:19.003

INFLUENCE.

SIX TATTOO ARTISTS LEFT.

MY FAIR OPINION ON IT.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.303
WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

06:27.387 --> 06:30.014
- LUKE WESSMAN'S BEEN TATTOOING
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,

06:30.098 --> 06:32.141
{\an8}AND I KNOW HE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH
WHEN IT COMES

06:32.225 --> 06:34.519
{\an8}TO JUDGING TATTOOS, SO I'M
A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.980
{\an8}- THIS WEEK, WE ARE
TESTING YOUR FLEXIBILITY.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.650
{\an8}- TATTOOERS NEED FLEXIBILITY

06:40.733 --> 06:42.777
{\an8}BECAUSE NOT EVERY PERSON'S
THE SAME,

06:42.860 --> 06:44.070
{\an8}NOT EVERY DESIGN
IS THE SAME,

06:44.153 --> 06:45.988
AND NOT EVERY SKIN TYPE
IS THE SAME.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.657

AND WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER

06:47.740 --> 06:50.159
FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS,
AND NO DOUBT,

06:50.243 --> 06:51.661
YOU'VE FORMED BONDS
AND BUTTED HEADS.

06:51.744 --> 06:55.373
TODAY YOU WILL HAVE
TO PUT ALL THAT ASIDE,

06:55.456 --> 06:58.918
BECAUSE TWO ARTISTS MUST CREATE
A COLLABORATION TATTOO

06:59.001 --> 07:03.506
ON ONE CANVAS
AS A TEAM.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.465
{\an8}- [bleep].

07:04.549 --> 07:07.343
{\an8}- EVERY TIME I WORK ALONE,
I DO WELL,

07:07.426 --> 07:09.345
{\an8}AND EVERY TIME I WORK IN TEAMS,
I GET SCREWED.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.347
- YOU AND YOUR TEAMMATE
MUST TAG TEAM.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.182
ONLY ONE OF YOU CAN TATTOO
AT A TIME.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.350
- [bleep].

07:14.433 --> 07:17.562
- AND YOU MUST SWITCH ARTISTS
EVERY HOUR.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.521
- THIS IS JUST GONNA
BE VERY HARD.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.857
{\an8}RIGHT WHEN YOU GET
INTO YOUR GROOVE,

07:20.940 --> 07:22.066
{\an8}YOU'RE THEN HAVING TO SWITCH
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.360
{\an8}- THIS IS A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE.

07:24.443 --> 07:27.488
- YOUR CANVASES ARE
COMPLETELY OPEN,

07:27.572 --> 07:29.949
SO THE STYLE AND SUBJECT
ARE COMPLETELY UP

07:30.032 --> 07:30.575
TO YOU AND YOUR TEAMMATE.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.493
- THAT'S COOL.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.955
- YOU'LL NEED FLEXIBILITY
TO CREATE A PERFECT, SEAMLESS,

07:36.038 --> 07:37.582
COHESIVE TATTOO THAT LOOKS

07:37.665 --> 07:39.458
LIKE ONE ARTIST DESIGNED
AND TATTOOED IT.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.626
- [bleep].

07:40.710 --> 07:42.795
- THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM
FOR ERROR IN THIS.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.172
{\an8}TWO DIFFERENT STYLES
OF TATTOOING TOGETHER

07:44.255 --> 07:45.715
{\an8}COULD BE A DISASTER.

07:45.798 --> 07:51.679
- THERE IS ONE LAST THING
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

07:51.762 --> 07:54.557
YOU WILL BE JUDGED AS A TEAM.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.058
- OH, [bleep].

07:56.142 --> 07:57.393
- [bleep].

07:57.476 --> 07:58.561
- ONE OF THE TOP DOGS MIGHT
END UP WITH SOMEBODY THAT

07:58.644 --> 08:00.771
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING
TO WORK WITH,

08:00.855 --> 08:01.564
AND YOU COULD POTENTIALLY
GO HOME.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.858
- [sighs]
SON OF A BITCH.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.986
- IF I HAVE TO GO HOME OFF
OF SOME ASS[bleep]'S MISTAKE,

08:07.069 --> 08:08.196
I'M GONNA BE
REALLY [bleep] PISSED.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.824
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

08:13.868 --> 08:18.122
YOUR CANVASES WILL
BE ASSIGNED RANDOMLY.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.250
THE CANVASES WILL EACH
CHOOSE TWO SKULLS.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.586
THE NAMES ON THE BOTTOM
OF THEIR SKULLS WILL DETERMINE

08:23.669 --> 08:25.338
THEIR ARTISTS AND THE TEAMS.

08:25.421 --> 08:26.339
- OH, BOY.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.007
{\an8}- NOBODY WANTS JAY
ON THEIR TEAM.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.009
NOT ONLY HAS JAY PROVEN
TO BE A WEAKER ARTIST,

08:30.092 --> 08:31.385
BUT HE'S ALREADY SHOWN
EVERYBODY

08:31.469 --> 08:32.553
THAT HE'S NOT GOOD AT WORKING
IN TEAMS.

08:32.636 --> 08:36.390
I KNOW I DON'T WANT HIM
ON MY TEAM.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.684
- CANVASES, PLEASE GO AHEAD
AND PICK YOUR SKULLS.

08:42.063 --> 08:46.567
- MATTI.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.568
SAUSAGE.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.444
- YEAH!

08:48.527 --> 08:50.613
- IS SAUSAGE MY FIRST CHOICE?

08:50.696 --> 08:51.948
NO, BUT AM I HAPPY
IT'S NOT JAY?

08:52.031 --> 08:55.618
{\an8}HELL, YEAH.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.953
{\an8}- GENTLE JAY.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.622
{\an8}- WHAT'S UP?

08:59.705 --> 09:01.958
{\an8}- IF I GET PUT ON A TEAM
WITH JAY,

09:02.041 --> 09:04.627
{\an8}SOMEONE'S GOING HOME
IN A [bleep] BODY BAG.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.677
{\an8}- MELISSA.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.054
{\an8}- OF COURSE I GET JAY,

09:15.137 --> 09:17.098
{\an8}THE ONE PERSON I DIDN'T WANT
TO WORK WITH.

09:17.181 --> 09:20.935
{\an8}- [bleep] LOOKS
ALL OVER THE FACE.

09:21.018 --> 09:24.647
{\an8}DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE
STANDING 20 FEET AWAY FROM US

09:24.730 --> 09:25.815
{\an8}CAN [bleep] SEE YOU?

09:25.898 --> 09:28.734
I'M ALREADY GETTING SCREWED
BY MY TEAMMATE,

09:28.818 --> 09:30.486
AND THE [bleep] THING
HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET.

09:30.569 --> 09:33.155
SHE NEEDS TO CLEAN
THAT [bleep] UP

09:33.239 --> 09:35.032
AND PUT A [bleep] SMILE
ON HER FACE.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.456
- SCOTT.
HALO.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.083
- YET AGAIN.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.668
{\an8}I'M STOKED BEING
PAIRED UP WITH SCOTT

09:45.751 --> 09:46.669
{\an8}BECAUSE I KNOW WE CONTRAST
EACH OTHER WELL,

09:46.752 --> 09:49.630
{\an8}AND THAT JUST MEANS
A GUARANTEED WIN.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.548
- YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE DAY
TO CONSULT

09:50.631 --> 09:52.842
WITH YOUR CANVAS
AND YOUR TEAMMATE.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.720
TOMORROW, YOU WILL HAVE
SIX HOURS TO TATTOO.

09:55.803 --> 09:59.515
THIS WEEK, THERE WILL
BE NO HUMAN CANVAS JURY,

09:59.598 --> 10:02.059
AND THE WINNERS WILL NOT PUT
AN ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

10:02.143 --> 10:06.522
ALL DECISIONS ARE
COMPLETELY UP TO THE JUDGES.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.816
IF YOU CAN'T SHOW FLEXIBILITY
BY WORKING TOGETHER

10:08.899 --> 10:10.443
TO CREATE
A COHESIVE PIECE,

10:10.526 --> 10:13.029
YOU WILL BE PACKING
YOUR MACHINES.

10:13.112 --> 10:16.532
GOOD LUCK.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.492
{\an8}- FLEXIBILITY IS THE NAME
OF THE GAME

10:18.576 --> 10:19.618
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO INCORPORATE
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS

10:19.702 --> 10:21.746
{\an8}OF THE DESIGN
THAT THE PEOPLE WANT,

10:21.829 --> 10:23.789
AND YOU HAVE TO CO-DESIGN IT
AND CO-TATTOO IT.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.666
IF EACH MEMBER OF THE TEAM
IS NOT FLEXIBLE,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.419
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
BUTTING HEADS.

10:28.502 --> 10:29.295
- YOU GOT A [bleep] KILLER TEAM,
DUDE.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.590
- [chuckles]
I HOPE SO.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.674
- A TRUE OPEN CANVAS?

10:33.758 --> 10:34.592
- YES.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.052
- AWESOME.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

10:36.135 --> 10:38.846
- I'M, LIKE, TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT A PIECE THAT WE COULD DO

10:38.929 --> 10:39.221
THAT'S GONNA MESH WELL TOGETHER.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.182
- RIGHT.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.308
{\an8}YOU'VE GOT TWO EXTREMELY
STRONG-WILLED PEOPLE

10:42.391 --> 10:44.852
{\an8}THAT HAVE NEVER WORKED TOGETHER.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.062
WHAT STYLE DO
YOU WANT TO GO?

10:46.145 --> 10:47.897
DO YOU WANT TO GO
MORE THE NEW SCHOOL?

10:47.980 --> 10:49.315
- I ALWAYS MIX, LIKE,
WHATEVER STYLES

10:49.398 --> 10:51.901
I GOT IN MY BAG TOGETHER.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.069
- I'M TOTALLY OPEN.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.236
I THINK THAT THIS IS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

10:54.320 --> 10:56.906
A REALLY COOL COLLABORATION
AND JUST KNOCK

10:56.989 --> 10:58.240
A TATTOO OUT OF THE PARK.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.116
I THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER
FOR ME TO MATCH YOURS.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.035
- OKAY.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.244
- IF YOU WANT TO PULL SOMETHING,

11:02.328 --> 11:03.371
AND THEN I CAN DEFINITELY GO
FROM THERE?

11:03.454 --> 11:04.455
- THAT SOUNDS COOL.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.582
- SO WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
ABOUT DOING?

11:06.665 --> 11:09.668
- I HAD AN IDEA OF, LIKE,
OCTOPUS OR A CAROUSEL HORSE.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.254
- I'VE GOT A COUPLE HORSES
THAT ARE PERFECT.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.424
- I JUST DID A REALLY KICK-ASS
HORSE LAST CHALLENGE.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.259
I'M A BETTER TATTOO ARTIST
THAN HALO,

11:17.343 --> 11:20.638
{\an8}SO I NEED TO TAKE CHARGE, SHOW
DOMINANCE RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.099
{\an8}YOU CAN GO TO THE LEFT MORE.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.100
{\an8}LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.935
{\an8}- I CAN PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF TRUST INTO SCOTT.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.854
{\an8}I DON'T FEEL LIKE SCOTT
PUTS AS MUCH TRUST IN ME.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.399
WE CAN PLAY
WITH A LOT OF WARM COLORS.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.983
- OR WE CAN DO, LIKE, A REALLY,
LIKE, BRIGHT LIME GREEN.

11:33.067 --> 11:37.363
- YEAH, I DEFINITELY WANT,
LIKE, A REALLY VIBRANT COLOR.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.075
- I REALLY LOVE ELEPHANTS.
- OKAY.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.785
- NATURE, TREES, FLOWERS.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.662
- MELISSA GOT UPSET
BECAUSE SHE'S PAIRED WITH ME.

11:44.745 --> 11:45.704
{\an8}I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHY SHE'S PISSY.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.957
MELISSA IS THE WEAKEST
OF THE BUNCH.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.960
I'M THE ONE
THAT SHOULD BE PISSED OFF.

11:51.043 --> 11:51.919
- I'M THINKING, LIKE,
AN ELEPHANT THAT HAS, LIKE,

11:52.002 --> 11:54.672
ONE OF THOSE DECORATIVE
HEADPIECES.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.715
JAY IS DEFINITELY ABRASIVE.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.967
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BE A NIGHTMARE.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.803
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA REALLY HAVE
TO FOCUS ON EACH OTHER.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.597
{\an8}- THE WAY THIS IS GONNA GO IS,
SHE'S GONNA DO HER JOB,

12:03.681 --> 12:06.684
{\an8}I'M GONNA DO MINE, AND LET
THE JUDGES PICK WHO DID BETTER.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.561
{\an8}IF THEY SEND TWO PEOPLE HOME,
FINE.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.980
{\an8}IF THEY SEND ONE,
IT'LL BE HER.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.148
{\an8}- I DON'T LIKE THE EYES.
I DON'T LIKE THE EARS.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.316
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE THE FOREHEAD.
- JUST GET IT DONE.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.485
{\an8}- WHAT THE [bleep]?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.070
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT DONE
DEALING WITH ME YET.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.614
{\an8}- YOU'RE BOTH IN TROUBLE.
- BAH!

12:29.665 --> 12:31.333
- WITH THE COLORS PLAYING
AGAINST EACH OTHER,

12:31.417 --> 12:33.461
I THINK THAT THIS'LL BE
A REALLY BRILLIANT PIECE.

12:33.544 --> 12:34.462
I'M STOKED.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.838
MATTI'S IDEA IS REALLY COOL.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.340
- WE CAN ALWAYS, LIKE, HAVE
A FEW HAIRS BEHIND IT HERE.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.508
- YEAH, THAT'S COOL.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.302
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE ONE PERSON DID IT.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.511
IT'S SUPER DIFFICULT.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.847
- WE SHOULD PICK OUT
SECTIONS EACH HOUR,

12:44.930 --> 12:46.515
SO WE HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.558
- CAN YOU LINE THIS
IN AN HOUR?

12:47.641 --> 12:48.517
- EASILY.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.477
- I LOVE WORKING IN TEAMS.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.145
LAST TIME WE WORKED
IN TEAMS, I WON,

12:51.228 --> 12:51.896
AND EVERYONE ELSE
FELL ON THEIR FACE.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.606
I PLAN ON DOING THAT AGAIN.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.107
THIS IS PERFECT.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.693
- YOU DON'T THINK THAT'LL
GIVE US TOO MUCH EAR TO DO,

12:57.776 --> 12:59.236
LIKE, TAKING UP
A BUNCH OF [bleep] SPACE?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.446
- NO, IT'S GONNA
BE THIS WIDE.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.655
- OKAY, BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE

13:01.739 --> 13:02.656
TO DO A TATTOO THIS BIG
IN SIX HOURS.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.241
- I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO FINE.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.952
- I JUST DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF SWITCHING EVERY [bleep] HOUR.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.954
{\an8}- I KNOW SHE'S TALKING,
AND I'M ACKNOWLEDGING

13:09.038 --> 13:10.289
{\an8}THAT SHE'S SPEAKING,

13:10.372 --> 13:12.082
BUT I'M NOT ACTUALLY LISTENING
TO ANY OF IT.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.918
- I DON'T LIKE THE EYES.
I DON'T LIKE THE EARS.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.002
I DON'T LIKE THE FOREHEAD.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.378
- [chatters]

13:16.462 --> 13:18.047
I JUST MAKE-BELIEVE I HEAR IT

13:18.130 --> 13:19.798
SO THAT I DON'T HAVE
TO HEAR IT AGAIN.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.926
- SAUSAGE AND MATTI'S PIECE
LOOKS [bleep] GREAT, DUDE,

13:22.009 --> 13:24.887
BUT I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT THE OTHER TWO.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.013
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

13:26.096 --> 13:27.598
- THEY'RE DOING,
LIKE, AN ELEPHANT,

13:27.681 --> 13:31.352
BUT THEY'RE BOTH DESIGNING
COMPLETELY SEPARATE PARTS OF IT.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.187
JAY AND MELISSA
ARE BUTTING HEADS.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.396
{\an8}IF YOU CAN'T WORK WELL
TOGETHER AS A TEAM,

13:34.480 --> 13:36.899
{\an8}THEN YOU FALL AS A TEAM.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.108
- WORKING ON THE SAME PROJECT,

13:38.192 --> 13:41.654
IT SHOWS WHO
THE [bleep] WEAK LINK IS, BRO.

13:41.737 --> 13:44.573
- ARTISTS, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS

13:44.657 --> 13:47.701
TO CREATE A COLLABORATION TATTOO
AS A TEAM,

13:47.785 --> 13:50.746
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

13:50.829 --> 13:54.166
- RIGHT HERE?
- HELL, YEAH.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.294
- I'M GONNA DO
THIS PART FIRST.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.921
{\an8}- TODAY THESE ARTISTS ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER,

13:59.004 --> 14:00.506
{\an8}AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE
IN ITSELF.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.049
TWO PEOPLE ARE
GONNA MAKE IT LOOK

14:02.132 --> 14:03.676
LIKE ONE TATTOOER
DID THE TATTOO.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.469
THEY HAVE TO WORK WELL
AS A TEAM.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.304
IF THEY DON'T,
IT'S GONNA SHOW.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.098
- READY?
- LET'S DO IT.

14:09.181 --> 14:12.560
- EVEN THOUGH SCOTT AND MATTI
HAVE AN ALLIANCE,

14:12.643 --> 14:14.979
{\an8}ULTIMATELY, MATTI'S MY PARTNER
FOR THIS CHALLENGE.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.438
I HAVE TO LET A LOT OF STUFF

14:16.522 --> 14:17.982
KIND OF GO BY THE WAYSIDE
IN ORDER TO WIN.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.153
- FIVE HOURS.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.073
SWITCH.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.950
- WE'RE GONNA TAKE A RISK
WITH THIS TATTOO TODAY.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.495
I PUT OUT AN IDEA
TO DO A HANNYA MASK.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.455
MY STYLE'S REALLY
OUTSIDE OF THE BOX.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.417
{\an8}I LIKE CREATING CUSTOM THINGS
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.548
{\an8}I'M MORE CONFIDENT IN MY SKILLS
THAN I AM IN MELISSA'S,

14:42.631 --> 14:44.592
SO I'M GONNA HANDLE
ALL THE REALLY HIGHLY DETAILED,

14:44.675 --> 14:45.634
HARD-TO-DO STUFF.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.636
MELISSA'S GONNA
HANDLE THE EASY STUFF.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.597
I'M PRETTY MUCH PULLING
THE WEIGHT ON THIS THING.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.140
- YOU'RE GONNA GET
THIS THING FINISHED?

14:51.223 --> 14:52.725
- GOD, WE HOPE SO.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.476
- LOOKING AT MELISSA
AND JAY'S TATTOO,

14:54.560 --> 14:56.812
IT'S VERY OBVIOUS
THAT NEITHER ONE OF THEM IS

14:56.895 --> 14:58.647
BENDING TO EACH OTHER'S STYLE.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.774
SHE'S ONLY TATTOOING THE PART
THAT SHE DESIGNED,

15:00.858 --> 15:02.484
AND HE'S ONLY TATTOOING
THE PART THAT HE DESIGNED.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.485
{\an8}IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY,

15:03.569 --> 15:05.654
{\an8}THIS IS A VERY WEAK TURNOUT
FOR THEM.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.282
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO
FOCUS ON IN THIS UPCOMING HOUR?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.998
- DON'T DO THE DARK ONE.
START WITH THAT ONE.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.958
GET THAT LINE SMOOTHER
RIGHT HERE.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.543
{\an8}- I CAN'T RELAX
BECAUSE SCOTT NEEDS TO BE

15:19.627 --> 15:21.712
{\an8}IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.631
- YOU COULD ALMOST CORNER
A LITTLE BIT,

15:23.714 --> 15:25.007
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S ALMOST A SPINE.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.052
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
SOME OF THAT SLATE

15:28.135 --> 15:30.346
AND PUT IT IN THE TENTACLES
BEFORE I GET INTO IT?

15:30.429 --> 15:31.305
LIGHTER THAN THAT.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.848
- TO GO OUT?
- YEAH.

15:32.931 --> 15:35.434
- WHEN SCOTT IS COMPETING,
HE'S HARD TO GET ALONG WITH

15:35.517 --> 15:37.686
BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY
EXCEPT SCOTT'S WAY.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.021
- DON'T CONNECT IT.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.023
JUST A LITTLE,
JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF THAT LINE.

15:41.106 --> 15:41.982
- DUDE, SHUT UP.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.193
WE ALREADY KNOW.
YOU'RE THE MAN.

15:44.276 --> 15:48.030
- YOU GOT TO GET IT SOFT
AROUND THAT EDGE, BRO.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.323
- SWITCH.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.575
- YOU'RE IN.
- TAKE YOUR GLOVES OFF.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.706
- WHEN WE COME BACK TO MY TURN,

15:57.790 --> 16:00.542
I'M GONNA GO FINISH THE REST
OF THE TINY, LITTLE LINES

16:00.626 --> 16:02.169
AND THEN MOVE RIGHT
INTO THAT BLACK SHADING.

16:02.252 --> 16:05.714
- JAY IS ONLY FOCUSING
ON HIS PARTS OF THE TATTOO.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.965
{\an8}EVERYTHING ELSE IS
BEING LEFT ON ME,

16:07.049 --> 16:09.593
{\an8}AND IT'S A GOOD 2/3
OF THE TATTOO.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.054
YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY TO BE ABLE
TO START THE COLOR

16:12.137 --> 16:15.432
ON THE ELEPHANT
JUST 'CAUSE I GOTTA COLOR

16:15.516 --> 16:16.892
ALL THAT GREEN STILL...
- OH, NO, I KNOW.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.352
- AND THE WHOLE ELEPHANT.
- I'M GONNA DO SHADING.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.896
- JUST DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN,
YOU KNOW.

16:20.979 --> 16:22.731
I'M DEFINITELY FEELING
THE PRESSURE OF MAKING UP

16:22.815 --> 16:25.150
FOR WHAT HE'S NOT DOING.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.737
- AND SWITCH ARTISTS.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.239
- JUST GET IN THERE
AND THEN BRING IT TOGETHER.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.615
DO YOUR BEST WITH IT,
YOU KNOW?

16:31.699 --> 16:33.075
- I JUST FEEL LIKE
A LOT IS BEING LEFT ON ME.

16:33.158 --> 16:36.078
- THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

16:36.161 --> 16:41.041
{\an8}THIS TATTOO IS GONNA
BE HURTING AT THE END OF IT.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.877
HALO AND I ARE PROVING THAT
WE WORK REALLY WELL AS A TEAM.

16:43.961 --> 16:44.962
THIS [bleep] LOOKING GOOD.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.090
- IT'S LOOKING [bleep] GREAT,
DUDE.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.758
- LOOKING AT
THESE THREE TATTOOS,

16:49.842 --> 16:50.926
I AM VERY CONFIDENT RIGHT NOW

16:51.009 --> 16:54.054
THAT WE'VE GOT THIS WIN
IN THE BAG.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.222
OOH, THAT [bleep] LOOKS GOOD.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.271
- HOW'D YOU SWITCH THE LINE WORK

17:02.354 --> 17:03.814
WITHOUT MESSING UP THE STENCIL
OR ANYTHING?

17:03.897 --> 17:05.773
- IT'S BEEN A PURE COLLABORATION
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,

17:05.858 --> 17:07.859
AS FAR AS LINE WORK,
SHADING.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.570
- MATTI AND SAUSAGE ARE
DOING A WEIRD DEMON HEAD THING.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.406
{\an8}THEY JUST COMPLETELY
OVERTHOUGHT IT

17:12.489 --> 17:15.492
{\an8}AND PUT WAY TOO MUCH CRAP
WHERE IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.743
IT'S JUST A MESS.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.369
I LOVE THE FACT
THAT THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING

17:18.454 --> 17:19.663
THAT COULD PUT THEM
AT THE BOTTOM

17:19.747 --> 17:21.874
BECAUSE IT HELPS TAKE
THE FOCUS OFF OF US.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.125
- GETTING THE VIBE
YOU GUYS WORK GOOD TOGETHER.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.627
- OH, THIS HAS BEEN AWESOME.
- COOL, MAN.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.338
YOU'RE IN THE HOME STRETCH.
- FINAL HOUR. SWITCH UP.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.471
- GONNA COME DOWN
TO THE WIRE HERE.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.972
- YUP.
- I KNOW IT.

17:37.055 --> 17:40.684
{\an8}I'M LEFT IN THE LAST HOUR
TO DO MOST OF THE TATTOO.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.644
{\an8}JAY BARELY GOT ANYTHING DONE,

17:42.728 --> 17:45.981
{\an8}AND NOW I'M LEFT
TO COLOR EVERYTHING IN.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.777
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE WE'RE [bleep].

17:49.860 --> 17:52.029
{\an8}- SHE NEEDS
TO STEP UP THE PACE,

17:52.112 --> 17:55.073
{\an8}AND I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO ASSIST HER.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.033
WHATEVER.
JUST DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.285
JUST PUT YOUR NOSE DOWN
AND TATTOO.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.245
JUST GET IT DONE.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.371
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:01.455 --> 18:02.498
DO YOU LIKE THE LOTUS
ON THE BOTTOM?

18:02.581 --> 18:05.125
- I PERSONALLY LIKE THE DETAILS
ON THE LOTUS.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.545
- THEY KIND OF SHOWED THAT THEY
GOT SOME SKILLS ON THAT ONE.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.671
- BUT IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.800
MELISSA HAS TO FINISH
THAT TATTOO.

18:12.883 --> 18:16.136
SAUSAGE AND MATTI--
THEIR TATTOO IS SO SCRAMBLED.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.971
IT'S HARD TO TELL
WHAT THE IMAGE IS.

18:18.055 --> 18:21.600
- THEY'RE NOT LOOKING GOOD.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.644
- TEN, NINE,

18:23.727 --> 18:25.521
EIGHT, SEVEN,

18:25.604 --> 18:28.440
SIX, FIVE,

18:28.524 --> 18:30.400
FOUR, THREE,

18:30.484 --> 18:32.236
TWO, ONE.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.112
MACHINES DOWN.
TIME IS UP.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.614
NO MORE INK.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.699
- OH, MY GOSH,
IT LOOKS AMAZING.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.826
- SWEET.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.369
- OH, DAMN.
LOOK AT THAT.

18:40.452 --> 18:40.911
- POW.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.872
- OH, MY GOD!

18:43.956 --> 18:46.250
- I KNOW THAT MY WORK
IN THIS IS SOLID,

18:46.333 --> 18:48.836
SO THE SHORTCOMINGS
ARE GONNA BE MELISSA'S.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.255
- I'M DEFINITELY UPSET
RIGHT NOW.

18:51.338 --> 18:55.884
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA GET JUDGED
FOR MISTAKES THAT AREN'T MINE.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.221
{\an8}- YOU [bleep] YOURSELF.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.305
{\an8}- THERE'S NO PART OF THAT
WHERE I COULD AGREE WITH YOU.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.725
{\an8}- OPINIONS ARE
A [bleep] DIME A DOZEN, MAN.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.269
- THIS IS A SOLID [bleep] PIECE.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.855
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU CAN GO HOME FOR THIS?

19:14.570 --> 19:17.322
- DID YOU GUYS END UP SEEING
JAY AND MELISSA'S PIECE?

19:17.406 --> 19:19.283
- IT LOOKED LIKE
TWO DIFFERENT ARTISTS DREW IT.

19:19.366 --> 19:22.035
THEY'RE GONNA GET BUTCHERED
ON THEIR DESIGN, MAN.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.036
- HEY, YOU.

19:23.120 --> 19:23.996
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
- OH, WOW.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.498
HEY.
- HOW'D IT GO?

19:26.582 --> 19:28.250
- IT WENT.

19:28.333 --> 19:32.004
- WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO PUT 6,000
LINES OVER TOP OF AN ELEPHANT?

19:32.087 --> 19:33.172
- THAT WAS JAY'S.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.090
JAY DID THE MIDDLE
OF THE LOTUS FLOWER

19:35.173 --> 19:36.925
AND THEN THAT LITTLE HEADDRESS,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.760
AND THE REST WAS JUST
UP TO ME.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.887
- SO JAY THINKING ABOUT JAY
INSTEAD OF JAY

19:39.970 --> 19:41.096
THINKING ABOUT THE TEAM.

19:41.179 --> 19:42.681
- I WAS JUST LIKE,
"HOLY [bleep], THIS IS A LOT."

19:42.764 --> 19:45.851
[door closes]

19:45.934 --> 19:46.935
- WHAT'S UP, JAY?
- SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.271
- WHAT'S UP?
"SPEAK OF THE DEVIL."

19:49.354 --> 19:51.940
- YEAH.
- WHAT'S UP?

19:52.024 --> 19:55.569
I WAS HAPPY WITH OUR DESIGN
AND EVERYTHING.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.654
- IT WAS JUST A LOT TO BE LEFT
IN THAT LAST HOUR.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.780
- WE GOT IT DONE.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.491
- WHEN LITERALLY THE ENTIRE BULK
OF THE TATTOO

20:01.575 --> 20:02.784
WAS UNCOLORED STILL?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.703
THE TOP IS COLORED,
AND THE BOTTOM IS COLORED,

20:04.786 --> 20:06.163
AND EVERYTHING
IN THE MIDDLE IS NOT?

20:06.246 --> 20:07.289
WOW, [bleep].

20:07.372 --> 20:09.207
THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF
FOR ONE HOUR.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.959
- YOU'RE STRESSING
YOURSELF OUT.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.795
MELISSA'S BEING A BIG BABY
ABOUT THIS ENTIRE THING.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.881
SHE'S BASICALLY PLAYING
THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.758
{\an8}GROW THE [bleep] UP, GIRL.

20:17.841 --> 20:18.467
{\an8}- YOU'RE BOTH IN TROUBLE.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.677
{\an8}IF YOU WORK BAD ON A TEAM,

20:20.761 --> 20:22.763
{\an8}IT MIGHT BE THE END
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.766
{\an8}JAY'S NINE LIVES ARE UP.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.894
{\an8}IT IS TIME
FOR HIM TO GO HOME.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.160
- TODAY YOU HAD THE ULTIMATE
TEST OF FLEXIBILITY,

20:45.243 --> 20:47.287
COLLABORATING
WITH ANOTHER ARTIST

20:47.371 --> 20:49.998
TO CREATE ONE TATTOO.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.794
HALO AND SCOTT,
LET'S START WITH YOU.

20:53.877 --> 20:54.878
IT'S AN UNUSUAL DESIGN.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.798
EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT THIS IS.

20:57.881 --> 21:01.343
- SHE WANTED TO GET
A CAROUSEL HORSE OR AN OCTOPUS.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.803
WE WANTED TO SHOW FLEXIBILITY,

21:02.886 --> 21:05.138
SO WE MADE ALL OF HER IDEAS
WORK TOGETHER AS ONE PIECE.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.724
- IN TERMS OF YOUR FLEXIBILITY,

21:07.808 --> 21:10.519
THE FACT THAT YOU WERE ABLE
TO UTILIZE YOUR CLIENT'S

21:10.602 --> 21:14.356
VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS IS
A VERY, VERY COOL THING.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.024
- I'M REALLY IMPRESSED
WITH HOW YOU GUYS USED

21:16.108 --> 21:17.609
THE TENTACLES OF THE OCTOPUS
BASICALLY WHERE THE HAIR IS.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.612
THAT WAS A REALLY TRICKY,
COOL WAY TO USE THAT.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.073
I LIKE THE CLEAN LINES,
MAN, AND THE HEAVY SHADING,

21:23.156 --> 21:24.950
AND THERE'S SOME REALLY GREAT
ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.369
- I REALLY LOVE THE DEEP, RICH
AREAS OF BLACK IN THE HORSE.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.372
I FEEL LIKE YOU COULD HAVE
PUT A LOT MORE BLACK

21:30.455 --> 21:32.666
IN THESE TENTACLES AND TEXTURED
THEM OUT A LITTLE BIT,

21:32.749 --> 21:34.960
JUST 'CAUSE IT WOULD'VE
MADE IT LOOK LIKE THEY GO

21:35.043 --> 21:36.628
WITH THE HORSE
A LITTLE BIT BETTER,

21:36.712 --> 21:38.296
BUT THAT'S JUST NITPICKING.
IT'S A VERY NICE JOB DESIGNING.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.673
I THINK
IT'S A VERY UNIQUE PIECE,

21:39.756 --> 21:42.217
AND IT REALLY SHOWS Y'ALL
COMING TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.428
- TO SEE YOU TWO WORK TOGETHER

21:44.511 --> 21:45.887
AND COME UP WITH THIS,

21:45.971 --> 21:48.265
SEEING YOUR STRONG BLACK
WITH HIS COLOR THEORY--

21:48.348 --> 21:50.642
APPLICATION'S FANTASTIC--
THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECT.

21:50.726 --> 21:51.476
GOOD JOB.

21:55.647 --> 21:56.523
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

21:56.606 --> 22:00.944
- GENTLE JAY AND MELISSA.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.487
- AS FAR AS WORKING
AS A TEAM,

22:02.571 --> 22:05.615
I CAN SEE A DEFINITE SEPARATION
IN DESIGN ELEMENTS.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.577
IT LOOKS MORE
LIKE A CUT-AND-PASTE FLOWER,

22:08.660 --> 22:10.704
FILIGREE, ELEPHANT,
PATTERN ON THE TOP.

22:10.787 --> 22:14.833
LIKE, DIFFERENT IDEAS WERE TAKEN
AND THEN JUST PIECED TOGETHER.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.043
- WE TALKED TO THE CLIENT,
AND SHE HAD A LIST OF THINGS

22:16.126 --> 22:18.211
THAT SHE WAS OPEN TO.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.796
SHE REALLY LIKED THE IDEA
OF THE ELEPHANT.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.590
SHE WANTED
A GEOMETRIC PATTERN.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.008
THEN WE SUGGESTED
THE HEADDRESS.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.426
SHE WANTED THE LOTUS.
- THE FLOWER.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.678
- WE JUST KIND OF BUILT
THE TATTOO AROUND WHAT WE FELT

22:26.762 --> 22:27.888
WE WERE GONNA BE BEST AT.

22:27.971 --> 22:30.432
- THERE WERE SOME NICE ELEMENTS
IN THIS TATTOO.

22:30.515 --> 22:33.101
THE SKIN OF THE ELEPHANT, I LIKE
HOW SOFT THE BLACK SHADING

22:33.185 --> 22:34.603
WENT TO THE GRAYS
AND THE BLUES,

22:34.686 --> 22:36.063
THAT LITTLE BIT OF TOUCH
OF PINK

22:36.146 --> 22:37.522
ON THE EDGES OF THE EARS
IS NICE.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.273
IT SEPARATES IT
FROM THE SKIN TONE.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.609
- I LIKE THE RED DESIGNS ON TOP.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.027
THAT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL,

22:42.110 --> 22:43.779
AND IT'S A REALLY NICE LOOK
FOR A WOMAN'S LEG.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.697
THE DETAILS IN THE HEADDRESS
ARE GREAT,

22:45.781 --> 22:47.949
AND THAT STUFF'S REALLY EXCITING
AND COOL TO LOOK AT,

22:48.033 --> 22:49.451
BUT SINCE IT'S OUR JOB
TO PICK IT APART,

22:49.534 --> 22:50.827
I SEE A LOT OF FLAWS.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.163
JUST THE INCONSISTENCIES
OF THE BODY--

22:53.246 --> 22:54.498
I WOULD'VE LIKED TO SEE THE
ELEPHANT COME OUT OF THE LOTUS

22:54.581 --> 22:56.750
INSTEAD OF BEHIND IT
BECAUSE IT JUST PUTS

22:56.833 --> 22:59.294
A WEIRD COOKIE-CUTTER VIBE TO IT
AND NOT A FLOWY VIBE.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.588
- THE BOTTOM OF THIS TATTOO
LOOKS TERRIBLE.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.715
- THERE'S NO PART OF THAT
WHERE I COULD AGREE WITH YOU.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.717
- THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS FILIGREE

23:05.801 --> 23:07.135
COMING OUT OF A LOTUS FLOWER.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.011
- THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A HORSE WITH TENTACLES

23:08.095 --> 23:10.138
ON ITS HEAD EITHER, BUT--

23:10.222 --> 23:11.473
- YEAH, BUT WE KNEW
IT WAS TENTACLES.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.475
TO HAVE AN ELEPHANT'S LEG
STEP OUT OF FILIGREE,

23:13.558 --> 23:16.353
I MEAN, LOOK AT IT.
IT'S CRAZY.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.563
FOR TWO PEOPLE
TO BE UP ALL NIGHT DRAWING,

23:18.647 --> 23:21.525
I EXPECT MORE.
- WE WEREN'T UP ALL NIGHT.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.611
- WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

23:27.948 --> 23:31.284
- SAUSAGE AND MATTI.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.537
EXPLAIN THIS DESIGN
A LITTLE BIT.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.664
- THIS IS ACTUALLY
JUST LIKE A BIG, GIANT MIX

23:35.747 --> 23:37.666
OF THE COOLEST STUFF
OUT OF JAPANESE STYLES

23:37.749 --> 23:39.167
THAT I LIKE TO PUT
INTO THINGS.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.919
- THIS TATTOO, FOR ME,
IS VERY CONFUSING.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.462
USUALLY WHEN WE GIVE SOMEBODY,

23:42.546 --> 23:44.589
STYLISTICALLY, THEY'RE OPEN
TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT,

23:44.673 --> 23:46.800
THEY TEND TO DO
WHAT THEY'RE REALLY GOOD AT.

23:46.883 --> 23:50.387
I DON'T FEEL LIKE EITHER ONE
OF YOU WOULD CLAIM JAPANESE

23:50.470 --> 23:53.849
AS THEIR MAIN FOCUS
IN ART AND TATTOOING.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.059
TO CHOOSE SOMETHING THAT'S
NEITHER ONE OF YOUR SPECIALTIES,

23:56.143 --> 23:58.562
IT'S CONFUSING TO ME.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.063
- WELL, IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN
GIVEN SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM

24:00.147 --> 24:01.690
THAT YOU JUST GO WILD--

24:01.773 --> 24:04.734
- ALL THE STRONG THINGS
THAT Y'ALL HAVE BOTH DONE

24:04.818 --> 24:06.319
TO THIS COMPETITION,
YOU'RE LIKE,

24:06.403 --> 24:08.572
"OH, WE ALREADY DID THAT.
LET'S NOT DO THAT ANYMORE."

24:08.655 --> 24:09.948
AND THAT, TO ME,
THAT'S A BUMMER.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.241
- I WANTED TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING

24:11.324 --> 24:12.367
THAT WAS [bleep] REALLY COOL.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.618
TECHNICALLY SOUND,
IT'S THERE.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.245
SATURATED EVERYTHING,
IT'S THERE.

24:15.328 --> 24:16.746
SKIN'S BREATHING
THROUGH THIS [bleep].

24:16.830 --> 24:19.207
I MEAN, TO ME,
IT JUST BREATHES AWESOME.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.293
- TECHNICALLY THIS TATTOO
IS SMOOTH THROUGHOUT.

24:21.376 --> 24:22.711
I'M JUST NOT THRILLED
ABOUT THIS DESIGN.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.255
- IT KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE SOMEONE HIT A DRAGON

24:25.338 --> 24:27.757
WITH A BASEBALL BAT
AND JUST SMUSHED THE FACE IN.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.050
HAVING SAID THAT,
I LOVE IT TECHNICALLY,

24:29.134 --> 24:31.595
AND I THINK THAT THE LINE WORK
AND THE COLOR WORK--

24:31.678 --> 24:33.180
EVERYTHING IS REALLY SOLID
AND TIGHT.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.640
- IT IS TATTOOED WELL,
BUT THERE'S FOUR PEOPLE UP HERE

24:35.724 --> 24:37.726
THAT JUST DON'T
AESTHETICALLY LIKE IT.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.061
YOU GUYS SHOULD BE
KNOCKING [bleep]

24:40.145 --> 24:41.396
OUT OF THE PARK TOGETHER.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.148
- THIS IS A SOLID [bleep] PIECE
WITH COLOR ALL OVER IT--

24:43.231 --> 24:44.399
- DUDE, IT'S JUST A FLAT TIRE.
- IT IS NOT--

24:44.482 --> 24:46.610
- SAUSAGE,
WHY ARE YOU SO PISSED, MAN?

24:46.693 --> 24:47.986
- IT'S JUST A DIFFERENCE
IN TASTE.

24:48.069 --> 24:48.945
- WHY ARE YOU SO, LIKE--
BUT WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

24:49.029 --> 24:50.405
- I KNEW
THAT YOU WERE GONNA TEAR IT.

24:50.488 --> 24:51.698
I [bleep] LOVE IT.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.408
- GREAT, BUT, I MEAN,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

24:53.491 --> 24:54.326
NOBODY ELSE DOES.

24:54.409 --> 24:55.660
- AND I THINK THAT
THAT--

24:55.744 --> 24:57.954
- OPINIONS ARE
A [bleep] DIME A DOZEN, MAN.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.080
- YOU HAVE THE ABILITY

24:59.164 --> 25:01.208
TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
ON SOMEBODY.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.418
DON'T DO PASSION PIECES.
DO SHOWSTOPPERS.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.837
DO SOMETHING THAT'S A FIGHT.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.923
IF NOT, YOU [bleep] YOURSELF.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.424
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
YOU CAN GO HOME FOR THIS?

25:09.507 --> 25:10.550
- NO WAY.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.801
I DON'T SEE IT.
- OKAY, NO WAY.

25:11.885 --> 25:12.928
- I DON'T SEE IT.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.013
- BUDDY, CAREFUL
WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

25:19.476 --> 25:22.187
- ALL RIGHT,
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

25:22.270 --> 25:24.814
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.572
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
IF NUNEZ LIKES IT OR NOT.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.573
- YOU SHOULD BE THINKING
ABOUT THAT

25:33.657 --> 25:34.908
BECAUSE IT'S A COMPETITION.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.368
- BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE
ABOUT WHETHER THE JUDGES

25:36.451 --> 25:38.286
ARE GONNA WEAR IT OR NOT--
WE MET THE CHALLENGE.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.204
- THEY'RE SAYING
YOU'RE HITTING THE CHALLENGE,

25:39.287 --> 25:40.247
BUT THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.790
- IT'S A TATTOO
FOR A TATTOO ARTIST.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.833
- IT'S REALLY BOLD,
IN YOUR FACE.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.001
- SEE, THAT WAS
YOUR MISTAKE.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.336
DON'T BE DOING
SOME CUTTING-EDGE,

25:46.419 --> 25:47.295
[bleep] CRAZY [bleep].

25:47.379 --> 25:49.089
- I THOUGHT IT WAS [bleep] COOL.

25:49.172 --> 25:50.006
- BUT NOT THIS LATE
IN THE GAME, DUDE.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.549
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:51.633 --> 25:53.301
I [bleep] HAD FUN, NO MATTER
WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF IT.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.469
- THEY MURDERED IT
DOWN THERE, DUDE,

25:54.552 --> 25:55.303
AND THEIR OPINION'S
GONNA MAKE OR BREAK YOU

25:55.387 --> 25:56.471
IN THIS COMPETITION.

25:56.554 --> 25:57.847
- OPINIONS ARE
LIKE ASS[bleep].

25:57.931 --> 26:00.600
EVERYBODY'S GOT 'EM,
AND THEY ALL STINK.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.352
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.646
IF JAY SURVIVES ANOTHER WEEK,
I'M GONNA BE [bleep] PISSED.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.941
IT WAS JAY'S TIME
LAST ELIMINATION.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.442
- I AGREE.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.318
- SO IF THEY SEND
BOTH OF YOU GUYS HOME,

26:10.402 --> 26:11.653
IT WOULD RUIN
THE COMPETITION.

26:11.736 --> 26:12.696
- WHATEVER.

26:12.779 --> 26:15.365
YOU'RE NOT DONE
DEALING WITH ME YET.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.458
- ALL RIGHT, TODAY WE DID
COLLABORATION TATTOOS.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.167
WE WERE TESTING FLEXIBILITY.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.461
HOW'D THESE GUYS DO?

26:28.545 --> 26:29.671
- ACTUALLY, WE SAW
A REALLY NICE ONE,

26:29.754 --> 26:32.048
AND WE SAW TWO THAT REALLY
LEFT US ON THE FENCE.

26:32.132 --> 26:35.385
- LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HALO AND SCOTT'S TATTOO.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.012
- THIS TATTOO, IT SHOWED
A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY

26:37.095 --> 26:41.057
ON THEIR PART TO WORK TOGETHER,
AND BOTH TATTOOED SEAMLESSLY.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.309
- IT LOOKED LIKE
ONE GUY DID IT.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.643
- THE APPLICATION
OF THAT REALLY HEAVY,

26:43.727 --> 26:46.563
SATURATED BLACK MAKES THAT
MUTED BLUISH BECOME VIBRANT.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.232
THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST
THOUGHT OUT REALLY WELL.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.358
- YEAH.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.485
- LET'S MOVE ALONG
TO MELISSA AND JAY.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.863
- IN THE LINE WORK
AND THE SHADING,

26:54.946 --> 26:56.948
IT JUST FEELS
A LITTLE MORE AMATEURISH.

26:57.032 --> 26:57.866
- AND IT'S SO CUT AND PASTE.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.827
FLOWER, ELEPHANT,
RED BACKGROUND,

27:00.910 --> 27:02.120
THERE'S NO INTERACTION
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS

27:02.203 --> 27:03.913
OF THIS TATTOO.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.165
- YEAH.

27:05.248 --> 27:07.459
LET'S TALK
ABOUT MATTI AND SAUSAGE.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.127
- THIS IS THE BIG SURPRISE
TO ME TODAY

27:09.210 --> 27:10.670
BECAUSE I FIGURED
WE WERE GONNA HAVE

27:10.754 --> 27:13.506
A MORE CLEAR-CUT DECISION
ON THE BOTTOM.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.508
I EASILY RECOGNIZE WHAT'S GOING
ON WITH THE ELEPHANT TATTOO.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.969
I HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT'S GOING ON

27:18.053 --> 27:20.055
WITH THIS MATTI-AND-SAUSAGE
DESIGN.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.473
THEY JUST KIND OF WENT WILD.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.266
- RIGHT, BUT THEY REALLY
DIDN'T GO THAT WILD.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.684
THEY JUST DID
AN UGLY DRAWING.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.561
- BUT IT'S LIKE,
HOW MUCH DO YOU FAULT THEM

27:26.644 --> 27:27.979
FOR NONE OF US LIKING
THE AESTHETIC OF IT?

27:28.063 --> 27:30.023
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,
TECHNICALLY, IT LOOKS GREAT.

27:30.106 --> 27:32.942
- BUT THEY'VE BOTH DONE
AMAZING DESIGN ELEMENTS

27:33.026 --> 27:34.277
THROUGHOUT THIS COMPETITION.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.196
THEY THREW ALL THAT
OUT THE WINDOW

27:36.279 --> 27:38.990
AND GAVE US SOME MISHMASH
[bleep] BULL[bleep]

27:39.074 --> 27:40.658
AND THEN TATTOOED IT
REALLY NICE.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.494
THEY TOOK A BIG SWING,
AND THEY MISSED.

27:42.577 --> 27:45.121
- IT LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE A DECISION.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.206
DO YOU WANT TO GET THEM?
- YEAH.

27:46.289 --> 27:47.874
- ALL RIGHT.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.667
[door closes]

27:55.632 --> 27:58.343
- JUDGES WANT TO SEE ALL
THE ARTISTS DOWN IN THE SHOP.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.097
- I THINK YOU GUYS ARE SAFE.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.598
YOU GUYS DID
A PHENOMENAL PIECE TODAY.

28:03.681 --> 28:05.600
- THE FACT IS, AT LEAST
ONE PERSON IS GONNA GO HOME.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.727
- THIS IS NOT
WHERE I WANTED TO BE.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.521
MAYBE I COULD GO HOME
BECAUSE I WANTED

28:09.604 --> 28:11.106
TO HAVE FUN ON THIS PIECE,

28:11.189 --> 28:13.233
BUT MAYBE I SHOULD'VE TAKEN IT
A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS.

28:13.316 --> 28:17.153
- WANT TO GO?

28:17.237 --> 28:18.696
- [sighs]

28:28.498 --> 28:32.585
- TODAY YOU HAD TO CREATE
ONE TATTOO FOR YOUR CANVAS,

28:32.669 --> 28:36.589
AND YOU WILL BE
JUDGED AS A TEAM.

28:36.673 --> 28:41.010
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY...

28:41.678 --> 28:45.974
GOES TO SCOTT AND HALO.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.600
- ONE COHESIVE DESIGN

28:47.684 --> 28:49.227
SHOWED THAT Y'ALL HAD
THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEAL

28:49.310 --> 28:51.688
WITH EACH OTHER'S STRENGTHS
AND WEAKNESSES AND PUT

28:51.771 --> 28:52.981
ONE GOOD, SOLID TATTOO
ON THE BOARD HERE.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.316
- CLEAN ALL THE WAY AROUND, MAN.
HIT THE MARK. CONGRATS.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.317
- THANK YOU.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.320
- SAUSAGE AND MATTI.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.655
- YOU DID
A TECHNICALLY SOUND TATTOO,

29:00.738 --> 29:03.658
BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE
EITHER ONE OF YOU CONTRIBUTED

29:03.741 --> 29:04.993
YOUR BEST DESIGN EFFORTS.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.202
- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

29:06.286 --> 29:08.246
THAT WE HAD MET
ALL THE CHALLENGE REQUIREMENTS.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.706
OTHER THAN THAT, I JUST FELT
THAT IT WAS A COOL TIME

29:09.789 --> 29:12.500
TO JUST WORK
WITH A TALENTED ARTIST

29:12.584 --> 29:14.502
AND REALLY JUST KIND OF SEE
WHERE WE COULD TAKE IT.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.004
MAYBE I JUST PICKED
THE WRONG TIME TO FEEL THAT WAY.

29:16.087 --> 29:19.716
- HAD YOU GUYS HAVE REALLY
COME WITH A CRAZY DESIGN,

29:19.799 --> 29:21.885
AS A COLLECTIVE, AND MADE IT
STRONG, YOU'D BE IN THE TOP.

29:21.968 --> 29:25.513
YOU COULD'VE KNOCKED THEM
OFF THEIR BLOCK.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.182
YOUR CHOPS ARE THE SAME
AS THEIR CHOPS,

29:27.265 --> 29:28.725
SO REALLY IT CAME DOWN
TO DRAWING.

29:28.808 --> 29:30.018
THEY DID A SIMPLE TATTOO.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.770
THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING LIKE,
"WOW, CRAZY!"

29:32.854 --> 29:34.689
NO, THEY HAD DEFINITION.

29:34.772 --> 29:36.524
YOU GUYS LACKED THAT,

29:36.608 --> 29:38.860
AND THAT'S THE REASON
YOU'RE IN THE [bleep] SPOT.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.655
- MELISSA AND JAY.

29:42.739 --> 29:44.032
- Y'ALL'S IDEA OF WORKING
AS A TEAM

29:44.115 --> 29:46.201
WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
THAN THE REST OF THE GUYS'.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.203
- REGARDLESS,
I STAND BY WHAT WE DID.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.579
- IT'S NOT A COHESIVE IMAGE.

29:49.662 --> 29:52.373
IT'S FOUR DIFFERENT THOUGHTS.

29:52.457 --> 29:55.793
WITH THE AURA, WITH
THE ELEPHANT, WITH THE FILIGREE,

29:55.877 --> 29:57.712
AND THEN THE LOTUS,
IT'S FOUR THOUGHTS,

29:57.795 --> 29:59.214
AND THAT'S WHAT'S ODD ABOUT IT.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.715
IT'S PIECED TOGETHER.

30:00.798 --> 30:01.799
YOU LOOK CONFUSED.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.343
WHAT ARE YOU CONFUSED ABOUT?
- ME?

30:03.426 --> 30:04.969
I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE LIKE,
"WHEN DOES FILIGREE...

30:05.053 --> 30:06.262
- NO, 100%.
- "EVER COME OUT OF A LOTUS?"

30:06.346 --> 30:08.097
LIKE, WHEN DOES A SKULL
EVER RIDE IN WAVES?

30:08.181 --> 30:12.060
- IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME,
REALLY, IT MAKES ZERO SENSE,

30:12.143 --> 30:14.103
AND AT THIS POINT,
YOU NEED TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE

30:14.187 --> 30:18.233
THAT YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU CAN
WALK AWAY WITH A "W" OR AN "L."

30:22.445 --> 30:26.866
- SAUSAGE, MATTI,
MELISSA, AND JAY,

30:26.950 --> 30:29.994
ANY ONE OF YOU COULD
JUSTIFIABLY BE ELIMINATED.

30:32.830 --> 30:34.916
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

30:42.715 --> 30:43.925
MELISSA AND JAY,

30:44.008 --> 30:47.971
YOU HAVE THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

30:48.054 --> 30:50.265
- WHEN THE CHALLENGE IS
SPECIFICALLY

30:50.348 --> 30:51.766
"MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE ONE ARTIST DID IT,"

30:51.849 --> 30:53.518
YOU COULD'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT
BETTER WORKING TOGETHER,

30:53.601 --> 30:56.729
SO IT DID LOOK MORE COHESIVE.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.857
- MELISSA AND JAY,

30:59.941 --> 31:03.820
ONLY ONE OF YOU

31:03.903 --> 31:05.863
WILL BE PACKING YOUR MACHINES.

31:07.865 --> 31:10.910
THE TWO OF YOU
MUST FACE OFF,

31:10.994 --> 31:13.997
TATTOOING
THE SAME DESIGN CREATED

31:14.080 --> 31:16.374
BY OUR GUEST JUDGE
LUKE WESSMAN.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.792
- YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE
THE DRAWING ALREADY DONE,

31:17.875 --> 31:21.838
SO ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS EXECUTE IT.

31:21.921 --> 31:23.965
- YOU'VE EACH BEEN RANDOMLY
ASSIGNED A HUMAN CANVAS,

31:24.048 --> 31:29.012
AND YOU WILL HAVE FOUR HOURS
TO TATTOO HEAD-TO-HEAD.

31:29.095 --> 31:32.557
ONE OF YOU WILL LOSE
YOUR SHOT AT $100,000

31:32.640 --> 31:35.518
AND THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.562
- THIS IS AS CLEAR-CUT
AS IT COULD BE.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.647
THIS IS
A STRAIGHT TECHNICAL CHALLENGE.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.649
THIS IS LAST-CHANCE SALOON
RIGHT HERE.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.151
- THIS IS IT,
AND THINK ABOUT IT.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.528
MATTI AND SAUSAGE
WERE THIS CLOSE

31:45.612 --> 31:46.988
TO BEING STANDING
WHERE YOU'RE STANDING,

31:47.071 --> 31:49.198
SO THIS COMPETITION IS STILL
VERY, VERY MUCH ALIVE.

31:49.282 --> 31:54.829
AND EITHER ONE OF YOU COULD
TAKE OUT ONE OF THOSE GUYS.

31:54.912 --> 31:58.207
GRAB YOUR MACHINES.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.543
{\an8}- HOLY [bleep],
FOR US TO BE ON THE SAME TEAM,

32:00.627 --> 32:02.462
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
WE'RE GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD?

32:02.545 --> 32:05.048
THIS IS CRAZY, BUT LUKE WESSMAN,
BEING A TRADITIONAL ARTIST,

32:05.131 --> 32:07.717
I FEEL LIKE THE DESIGN
WILL BE TRADITIONAL,

32:07.800 --> 32:10.803
AND I KNOW I HAVE JAY BEAT
ON THAT.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.680
- I'VE BEEN TATTOOING
A DECADE LONGER THAN THIS GIRL

32:12.764 --> 32:14.557
EVEN KNEW WHAT TATTOOING WAS.

32:14.641 --> 32:15.808
ME AGAINST HER?

32:15.892 --> 32:17.935
{\an8}I WIN, PERIOD.

32:26.944 --> 32:27.820
- WELCOME, GUYS.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.073
THIS IS THE FACE-OFF CHALLENGE.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.533
ONE OF YOU
WILL BE GOING HOME.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.662
YOU HAVE FOUR HOURS
TO CREATE A TATTOO DESIGNED

32:35.745 --> 32:37.538
BY OUR GUEST JUDGE
LUKE WESSMAN.

32:37.622 --> 32:41.250
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
HERE'S THE DESIGN.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.295
A LEOPARD TAKING A BITE
OUT OF A ROSE.

32:44.379 --> 32:45.546
DON'T MESS IT UP.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.841
- AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

32:49.967 --> 32:51.094
- WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

32:51.177 --> 32:52.178
- MELISSA.
- JAMES.

32:52.261 --> 32:53.596
- JAMES?

32:53.680 --> 32:56.766
{\an8}- IT'S A REAL FACE-OFF
WHEN YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER PERSON

32:56.849 --> 32:58.518
{\an8}DOING THE EXACT SAME TATTOO
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

32:58.601 --> 33:01.646
IF YOU MESS ONE THING UP
AND THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T,

33:01.729 --> 33:04.816
IT'S GONNA BE APPARENT.

33:04.899 --> 33:08.027
- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY, I NEED YOU
TO STAY NICE AND RELAXED FOR ME.

33:08.111 --> 33:11.447
IT'S LUKE WESSMAN'S STYLE,
A COUGAR HEAD PUKING OUT A ROSE.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.825
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
THIS THING IS DOING.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.493
I DON'T KNOW THE RULES
OF TRADITIONAL.

33:15.576 --> 33:18.162
I'M JUST GONNA CONCENTRATE
ON CLEANER LINES,

33:18.246 --> 33:20.164
SMOOTHER SHADING,
BETTER SATURATION.

33:26.879 --> 33:29.841
- JUST BECAUSE JAY HAS QUADRUPLE
THE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE

33:29.924 --> 33:32.343
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I CAN'T BEAT HIM.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.137
I KNOW I'M A BETTER ARTIST, AND
I'M GONNA SHOW HIM THAT TODAY.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.849
- HEY.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.977
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.605
{\an8}- SCOTT AND MATTI
ARE IN THERE

33:44.689 --> 33:46.649
{\an8}GIVING HER STEP-BY-STEP
INSTRUCTIONS.

33:51.195 --> 33:53.906
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
TO THINK FOR HERSELF.

33:58.035 --> 34:00.121
{\an8}- PAYBACK IS A BITCH.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.206
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO HELP MELISSA BEAT JAY.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.629
JAY CAME AFTER ME, TRYING
TO [bleep] WITH MY REPUTATION,

34:08.713 --> 34:10.757
SO I'M GONNA DO IT RIGHT BACK
TO HIM.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.967
{\an8}KARMA'S A BITCH, DUDE.

34:14.051 --> 34:16.846
- TWO HOURS REMAIN.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.681
- HOW DO YOU FEEL KNOWING
THAT THERE'S PEOPLE

34:18.764 --> 34:19.474
ACTUALLY ROOTING AGAINST YOU?

34:19.556 --> 34:20.808
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

34:20.891 --> 34:23.060
STORY OF MY LIFE, BRO.

34:23.143 --> 34:25.563
THEY KNOW MELISSA IS
THE WEAKER OF THE TWO,

34:25.646 --> 34:27.315
SO THEY'RE GONNA HELP HER,

34:27.398 --> 34:29.108
AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA TAKE HER
OUT NEXT.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.739
- I DON'T REALLY CARE

34:35.822 --> 34:37.658
IF SCOTT HAS ALTERNATIVE MOTIVES
IN HELPING ME OUT.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.703
I KNOW HE WANTS JAY GONE,
BUT WHY WOULD I TURN DOWN

34:40.786 --> 34:43.790
THE ADVICE FROM SOMEONE WHO'S
CONSISTENTLY BEEN IN THE TOP?

34:45.750 --> 34:48.668
{\an8}- JAY SHOULD'VE BEEN GONE
TWO CHALLENGES AGO.

34:48.753 --> 34:52.215
HE'S LIKE A GIANT COCKROACH
WITH LONG HAIR AND A BEARD.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.925
YOU JUST CAN'T KILL THIS DUDE.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.721
- WHATEVER WE GOTTA DO
TO GET RID OF THIS GUY,

34:58.805 --> 35:00.264
WE GOTTA DO IT NOW.

35:00.348 --> 35:04.644
- IF ALL OF YOU NEED
TO GANG UP AGAINST ME,

35:04.727 --> 35:08.272
THAT SHOWS YOU
HOW SCARED YOU ARE OF ME.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.482
- FIVE, FOUR,

35:09.565 --> 35:12.401
THREE, TWO,

35:12.485 --> 35:13.653
ONE.

35:13.736 --> 35:14.487
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

35:14.570 --> 35:17.281
TIME IS UP.
NO MORE INK.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.202
- I AM VERY CONFIDENT

35:21.285 --> 35:24.121
THAT I DID A BETTER TATTOO TODAY
THAN JAY DID.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.666
HIS TATTOO JUST
LOOKS DARK AND MUDDY.

35:26.749 --> 35:29.293
THEY'D BE CRAZY TO SEND ME HOME
BEFORE JAY.

35:37.093 --> 35:37.969
- WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

35:38.052 --> 35:40.471
- HOW'S TEAM MELISSA FEELING?

35:40.555 --> 35:41.764
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.474
WHEN I WIN, IT'LL BE LIKE
I BEAT ALL OF YOUSE.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.059
BAH!

35:45.143 --> 35:46.644
- REGARDLESS OF WHO'S
OVER MY SHOULDER TELLING ME

35:46.727 --> 35:47.770
WHAT'S GONNA LOOK COOL,

35:47.854 --> 35:49.188
NO ONE CAN MAKE ME
TATTOO IT BETTER.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.731
- IT'S MORE
ABOUT TAKING SIDES,

35:50.815 --> 35:53.818
SO IT'S KIND OF HARD
NOT TO FEEL GANGED UP ON.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.611
- I WASN'T TRYING TO GANG UP
ON YOU, DUDE.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.196
- BUT YOU STILL
PICKED A SIDE, THOUGH.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.739
- LOOK, JAY, MAN, LIKE,
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE,

35:58.823 --> 36:00.575
IT'S CLEARLY BEEN ABOUT YOU,
YOU, YOU, LIKE...

36:00.658 --> 36:02.410
- YOU'RE GONNA SAY
IT'S BEEN ABOUT ME, ME, ME,

36:02.493 --> 36:04.453
WHEN EVERY CHALLENGE, LIKE...
- NO, THAT'S--

36:04.537 --> 36:05.830
- IT'S BEEN LIKE
THE SCOTT MARSHALL SHOW.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.123
- I'M TALKING
ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY, MAN.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.667
- [bleep] YOU. [bleep] YOU.
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.085
- "[bleep] YOU.
[bleep] YOU. [bleep] YOU."

36:11.168 --> 36:13.713
THAT'S YOUR MENTALITY,
I DON'T WANT THAT AROUND ME,

36:13.796 --> 36:14.839
MAN, SO IF IT'S GONNA
BENEFIT ME TO HELP HER

36:14.922 --> 36:17.091
SO THAT YOU GO HOME...

36:17.174 --> 36:18.593
- AND IF I SEE THAT
AND I SAY [bleep] YOU,

36:18.676 --> 36:19.802
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

36:19.886 --> 36:21.262
YOU GONNA GET MAD ABOUT IT?
DOESN'T MATTER.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.638
- YOU'VE BROUGHT EVERYTHING
ON YOURSELF, MAN.

36:22.722 --> 36:26.392
- HOW MAD ARE YOU GONNA BE WHEN
I COME WALKING BACK UP HERE?

36:40.865 --> 36:42.283
- MELISSA AND JAY,

36:42.366 --> 36:44.702
YOU FACED OFF
TATTOOING A DESIGN

36:44.785 --> 36:48.080
BY LUKE WESSMAN
TO SHOW YOUR FLEXIBILITY.

36:48.164 --> 36:50.207
ONE OF YOU WILL BE STAYING,

36:50.291 --> 36:54.170
AND ONE OF YOU WILL BE PACKING
YOUR MACHINES.

36:54.253 --> 36:56.047
FIRST UP, MELISSA.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.758
- OVERALL, I LIKE THE TATTOO.

36:58.841 --> 37:00.217
I LIKE THE COLOR CHOICES
YOU WENT WITH.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.886
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU DID THE LEAVES,

37:01.969 --> 37:04.138
BUT I DON'T LIKE HOW YOU LEFT
THE WHITE SPACES ON THE ROSE.

37:04.221 --> 37:06.057
NORMALLY, YOU CAN
KIND OF LEAVE THOSE OPEN,

37:06.140 --> 37:07.266
BUT SINCE IT WAS BIGGER,

37:07.350 --> 37:08.392
IT KIND OF STANDS OUT
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.102
- THE MAIN THING
THAT JUMPS OUT AT ME

37:10.186 --> 37:12.104
RIGHT WHEN I START TO LOOK AT IT
IS YOUR LINE WORK.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.815
- THERE IS A COUPLE OF LINES
THAT INK OUT A LITTLE BIT.

37:14.899 --> 37:15.858
THE SMALLER OUTSIDE EYEBALL,

37:15.942 --> 37:18.069
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE A BIG HICCUP
IN THERE.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.320
IT'S AN IMPORTANT SPOT TO HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF A CROOKEDNESS.

37:19.403 --> 37:22.323
IT'S A FOCAL POINT
OF THE TATTOO.

37:22.406 --> 37:23.950
- I TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING
MORE SINGLE PASS,

37:24.033 --> 37:25.117
UNLESS IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT REALLY NEEDED TO BE HIT.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.327
- BEING THAT IT IS
AN EYEBALL

37:26.410 --> 37:28.913
AND BEING THAT IT IS
HIGHLIGHTED WITH YELLOW,

37:28.996 --> 37:29.914
IT JUST STANDS OUT.

37:29.997 --> 37:31.666
- THE LINE WORK
IN THESE TATTOOS HAVE

37:31.749 --> 37:35.503
TO BE REALLY PRECISE
AND DEAD-ON.

37:35.586 --> 37:36.545
- JAY.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.172
- I DON'T LOVE
THE COLOR PALETTE.

37:38.255 --> 37:40.132
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE DYNAMIC FEEL
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE

37:40.216 --> 37:41.342
FROM THIS TYPE OF DESIGN.

37:41.425 --> 37:44.345
IT SHOWS A LITTLE BIT OF LACK
OF FLEXIBILITY.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.055
EVERYTHING KIND OF MUDDIES OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.390
THE HEAD DOESN'T STAND
TOO FAR APART FROM THE ROSE,

37:47.473 --> 37:50.393
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE
A DEEPER, DARKER FEEL.

37:50.476 --> 37:52.770
- I REALLY LIKE THE AMOUNT
OF BLACK YOU PUT IN THE ROSE

37:52.853 --> 37:54.522
AND THE STYLE YOU DID IT,
WHERE YOU JUST KIND OF LEAVE

37:54.605 --> 37:56.190
THIS PERFECT, LITTLE,
WHITE GHOST LINE

37:56.273 --> 37:57.483
AROUND THE EDGE
OF THE BLACK LINE.

37:57.566 --> 37:58.651
YOU PULLED
THAT TECHNIQUE OFF GREAT.

37:58.734 --> 38:01.988
WHERE YOU TOOK THAT GREATNESS
AND FADED OUT

38:02.071 --> 38:05.408
IS BY DOING THESE LEAVES
JUST SO DARK.

38:05.491 --> 38:07.410
- THE LEAVES ACTUALLY WAS
THE CANVAS' FAVORITE PART

38:07.493 --> 38:08.869
OF THE TATTOO.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.913
HE WISHES I WOULD'VE COLORED
THE WHOLE THING SOLID LIKE THAT.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.164
- YOU WENT
A LITTLE BIT OVERBOARD

38:12.248 --> 38:13.916
BETWEEN YOUR BLACK SHADING

38:14.000 --> 38:15.209
AND THE NO BREAKS
IN THE LEAVES.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.753
THIS LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

38:17.837 --> 38:20.256
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT ROSE
AND YOU REIMAGINE

38:20.339 --> 38:21.966
WHAT THE REST OF YOUR TATTOO
COULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE

38:22.049 --> 38:23.926
HAD YOU HAVE STAYED
ON THAT COURSE,

38:24.010 --> 38:28.389
YOU'D BE LOOKING
AT A VERY DIFFERENT TATTOO.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.266
- FOR ME, LOOKING AT
THESE TWO TATTOOS SIDE BY SIDE,

38:30.349 --> 38:32.518
BOTH OF Y'ALL
DID A GOOD JOB.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.437
IT'S A TEETER-TOTTER
RIGHT NOW.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.855
- I LIKE MELISSA'S BETTER.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.190
- BECAUSE YOU COACHED HER
ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.776
- HOW MUCH ASSISTANCE DID
MELISSA RECEIVE FROM YOU GUYS?

38:40.860 --> 38:42.570
- WE KIND OF WERE CHEERING
FOR HER AS THE UNDERDOG,

38:42.653 --> 38:44.572
BUT SHE'S THE ONE
THAT EXECUTED THE TATTOO.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.240
- THERE WAS, LIKE, A WHOLE TEAM
OVER THERE,

38:46.323 --> 38:47.450
AND I WAS PRETTY MUCH
WORKING BY MYSELF.

38:47.533 --> 38:50.911
- I MADE A GAME DECISION,
AND I LISTENED TO PEOPLE

38:50.995 --> 38:53.622
WHO I KNEW YOU GUYS USUALLY
LIKE THE OPINIONS OF.

38:53.706 --> 38:56.333
REGARDLESS OF MATTI
OR SCOTT HAVING TO TELL ME,

38:56.417 --> 39:00.671
{\an8}I WOULD NEVER DO
THAT SOLID OF COLOR IN LEAVES,

39:00.755 --> 39:02.673
{\an8}AND I WOULD HONESTLY HAVE
A LOT MORE SKIN BREAKS.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.091
- I'M HAPPY
WITH THE TATTOO I DID.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.468
MY LINE WORK WAS CLEAN.

39:05.551 --> 39:06.719
MY SHADING WAS ALL SOLID
WHERE IT NEEDED TO BE.

39:06.802 --> 39:10.056
I KNOW YOU GUYS SAY
THE SATURATION IN LEAVES IS

39:10.139 --> 39:11.599
A LITTLE BIT MUCH
AND THEY'RE TOO DARK,

39:11.682 --> 39:13.601
BUT THE CANVAS--
THAT WAS HIS FAVORITE PART.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.436
AS A TATTOO ARTIST,
THE PERSON WEARING IT IS

39:15.519 --> 39:17.480
WHO I'M LISTENING TO,
AND HE'S HAPPY WITH THE TATTOO,

39:17.563 --> 39:21.108
SO I'M HAPPY WITH THAT.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.527
- IF THERE WAS A CHECKLIST,
YOU'D HIT SOME, SHE'D HIT SOME.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.654
{\an8}IF MELISSA'S SHADING
WAS A LITTLE SOLIDER,

39:25.738 --> 39:27.656
{\an8}IF HER ROSE LOOKED
A LITTLE MORE LIKE HIS,

39:27.740 --> 39:30.284
{\an8}IF HE HAD A LITTLE BIT LESS
OF THE MUDDY BROWN...

39:30.367 --> 39:31.452
{\an8}YOU KNOW, HIS LEAVES ARE
COMPLETELY SATURATED.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.704
{\an8}HERS WEREN'T,
WHICH MAKES IT HARD.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.123
THERE'S NO CLEAR-CUT WINNER
FOR ME HERE.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.753
- THE JUDGES HAVE REACHED
A DECISION.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.928
JAY...

39:49.011 --> 39:53.808
YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.142
- JAY, YOU HAD
GREAT APPLICATION,

39:55.226 --> 39:56.852
BUT YOU JUST WENT OVERBOARD.

39:56.936 --> 40:00.648
YOU TOOK AWAY FROM THIS DESIGN
BY ADDING TOO MUCH.

40:00.731 --> 40:03.734
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:03.818 --> 40:06.153
- [bleep] YOU, SCOTT.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.658
THREE TATTOO ARTISTS TOGETHER,

40:10.741 --> 40:14.745
TEAMING UP IS WHAT IT TOOK
TO GET RID OF ME.

40:14.829 --> 40:18.874
IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ME AND HER
IN A ROOM BY OURSELVES, I WON.

40:18.958 --> 40:19.875
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
MADE THOSE DECISIONS.

40:19.959 --> 40:23.337
THAT WAS ALL THEM.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.048
narrator: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:26.132 --> 40:28.509
- OH!
- HEY!

40:28.592 --> 40:30.261
- TIME TO CALL EVERYBODY'S BLUFF
AND SEE WHO CAN DRAW.

40:30.344 --> 40:31.846
- I'M GONNA NAIL SCOTT.
I THINK I'M GONNA THROW UP.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.848
[groans]

40:33.931 --> 40:35.391
- I'M AT THE TOP.
- NO, DUDE.

40:35.474 --> 40:37.726
- HE DID SOMETHING THAT WILL
SEND HIS ASS TO THE BOTTOM.

40:37.810 --> 40:38.978
YOU'RE GONNA [bleep] STUMBLE.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.771
- BULL[bleep].
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.106
THE CHALLENGE--
- I DON'T WANT IT TOO CONFUSING.

40:42.189 --> 40:44.066
- I DO NOT NEED THIS [bleep]
RIGHT NOW.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.986
I'LL DRAG YOU BACK
IN HERE BY YOUR HAIR.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.529
DON'T THINK I WON'T
FOR 100 GRAND.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.114
- IT'S HARD TO TELL
WHAT THE [bleep]'S GOING ON.

40:50.197 --> 40:51.198
- THIS WOULD BE,
LIKE, MY FIRST HICCUP.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.283
TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.451
- SO MANY FLAWS.
- DEFINITELY THE BOTTOM.
