WEBVTT

00:04.272 --> 00:05.506
(Tessa) HERE IN THE SUBURBS,

00:05.539 --> 00:09.377
PEOPLE DO WHATEVER THEY CAN
TO AVOID GETTING OLD...

00:09.410 --> 00:11.545
(spray hissing)

00:14.515 --> 00:17.218
AND MY DAD WAS NO EXCEPTION.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.419
(boing)

00:20.288 --> 00:21.289
GRAY CHEST HAIR.

00:24.425 --> 00:28.196
SO THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.330
(crunching, mouth full)
HEY, CAN WE GET

00:29.363 --> 00:30.764
SOME SUGAR CEREAL, GEORGE?

00:30.798 --> 00:31.865
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN

00:31.899 --> 00:34.768
SINCE I'VE SEEN
A LEPRECHAUN OR A CAP'N?

00:34.802 --> 00:37.538
TELL ME THE TRUTH. DO I LOOK OLD
ENOUGH TO HAVE A 16-YEAR-OLD?

00:37.571 --> 00:38.572
OH, HERE WE GO.

00:38.606 --> 00:42.376
16. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
TURNING 16 THIS WEEKEND.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.711
MY LITTLE GIRL.
(cabinet door closes)

00:43.744 --> 00:47.081
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE SUGAR
THAN I WAS HOPING FOR.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.616
COME ON, TESSA.
AREN'T YOU EXCITED ABOUT IT?

00:48.649 --> 00:49.483
DON'T YOU WANT A PARTY?

00:49.517 --> 00:50.684
I'M HAVING A PARTY.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.320
LISA AND MALIK ARE
COMING OVER FOR PIZZA.

00:52.353 --> 00:56.624
UGH. BOO! COME ON.
THIS IS YOUR 16th BIRTHDAY.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.892
LET'S GO BIG.
OKAY, FINE.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.561
WE'LL ORDER
THE EXTRA LARGE.

01:00.594 --> 01:04.198
HEY, IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT MONEY, DON'T BE.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.566
THINGS ARE PICKING UP
FOR ME.

01:05.599 --> 01:09.570
I CAN AFFORD TO SPOIL
MY ONLY DAUGHTER A LITTLE.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.472
I'VE GOT SOME VERY GOOD IDEAS
FOR YOUR PRESENT.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.707
CAN ONE OF 'EM BE
THAT YOU DON'T PICK IT OUT?

01:13.741 --> 01:16.810
Captioned by
Closed Captioning Services, Inc.

01:16.844 --> 01:21.749
(woman) * LAST NIGHT I HAD
A PLEASANT NIGHTMARE *

01:21.782 --> 01:23.517
* DA-DA-DA-DA,
DA, DA, DA, DA *

01:26.587 --> 01:29.157
WHEN SHOPPING IN THE SUBURBS,
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE

01:29.190 --> 01:30.458
THAT HAS EVERYTHING
A GIRL COULD WANT

01:30.491 --> 01:31.725
FOR HER BIRTHDAY...
(rattling)

01:31.759 --> 01:35.163
PLUS LEPRECHAUN CEREAL...
AND MEAT.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.330
THAT'S A LOT
OF BATH TISSUE.

01:36.364 --> 01:39.800
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
TO BE PREPARED.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.469
I CANNOT BELIEVE...

01:41.502 --> 01:42.503
WHAT?

01:42.536 --> 01:44.338
THEY PUT AVERAGE SHELF LIFE
IN THE CLEARANCE BIN.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.774
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT
IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE.

01:46.807 --> 01:50.811
$4.99. YOU KNOW, I-I GOTTA SAY,
I WAS WILLING TO SPEND $6.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.814
I ALREADY DOWNLOADED IT,
BUT NOW I HAVE THE LINER NOTES.

01:53.847 --> 01:57.651
THESE GUYS ARE, LIKE,
THE BEST INDIE BAND EVER.

01:57.685 --> 01:58.919
THEY HAVE AN OBOE.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.288
REALLY?

02:02.990 --> 02:04.858
EAR HAIR TRIMMERS?
ARE THESE OURS?

02:04.892 --> 02:05.959
JUST... YOU NEED IT.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.795
I D--I DON'T HAVE
HAIRY EARS.

02:07.828 --> 02:11.232
LOOK WHO IT IS.
(laughs) HEY, GUYS!

02:11.265 --> 02:12.466
HEY.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.235
OH, I HATE TO BUMP INTO PEOPLE
WHEN I'M NOT WEARING ANY MAKEUP.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.837
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I'M A WRECK.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.606
YOU HAVE A VEINY FOREHEAD.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.374
ISN'T THIS PLACE
JUST THE BEST?

02:20.408 --> 02:21.309
I MEAN, WHERE ELSE
CAN YOU BUY

02:21.342 --> 02:23.911
MAYONNAISE
AND NAIL POLISH REMOVER?

02:23.944 --> 02:25.646
ANY... STORE.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.748
YES, BUT NOT
SO VERY MUCH OF IT.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.184
(gasps) OH. WHAT ARE
YOU CAMPERS SHOPPING FOR?

02:30.218 --> 02:31.885
OH, NOTHING. JUST,
UH, A PRESENT...

02:31.919 --> 02:34.422
(clenches teeth, singsongy)
FOR TESSA'S 16th BIRTHDAY.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.856
(gasps)
TESSA'S TURNING SWEET 16.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.090
OH, MY GOD. THAT'S HUGE.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.893
TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOUR PARTY.
DON'T LEAVE OUT A SINGLE DETAIL.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.762
OKAY, DETAILS. UH, LET'S SEE.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.398
A COUPLE FRIENDS ARE COMING OVER
FOR PIZZA AND A MOVIE.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.333
AND?

02:45.366 --> 02:47.201
AND WE MIGHT NOT DO THE MOVIE.

02:47.235 --> 02:51.805
NO. NO! NO, NO, NO!
DID YOU HEAR THAT, DALIA?

02:51.839 --> 02:52.606
NO.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.842
YOU GOTTA GO BIG,
MAKE IT AN EVENT.

02:54.875 --> 02:55.843
THAT'S WHAT I SAID,

02:55.876 --> 02:56.944
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW,
SHE WANTS TO KEEP IT LOW-KEY.

02:56.977 --> 03:01.815
IT'S TRUE. THIS IS ALL WANT.
THEY ARE MY FAVORITE BAND.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.685
FOR SERIOUS?
LET ME SEE THIS.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.488
OH, MY HUSBAND'S COLLEAGUE
OWNS THIS LABEL

03:07.521 --> 03:09.423
AND A MAJOR TACO FRANCHISE

03:09.457 --> 03:12.426
AND A WHITE TIGER...
OR A BENGAL.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.262
I'M NOT SURE.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.797
BUT, ANYWAY, IT'S TOO BAD THAT
YOU'RE NOT HAVING A BIG PARTY,

03:16.830 --> 03:20.534
'CAUSE IF YOU WERE, HE COULD
PROBABLY GET 'EM TO PLAY.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.670
WAIT. AVERAGE SHELF LIFE?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.972
YOU CANNOT GET A.S.L. TO PLAY
AT MY PARTY.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.408
WELL, NOT FOR TWO BUDDIES
AND A PIZZA,

03:27.441 --> 03:29.310
BUT IF IT WERE
A BIG EVENT...

03:29.343 --> 03:33.013
WHO SAID TWO BUDDIES A PIZZA?
NO BUDDIES AND A PIZZA.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.516
WE'RE GOING BIG.
AREN'T WE GOING BIG, GEORGE?

03:35.549 --> 03:36.717
WELL, YOU DID SAY--
I SAID WE'RE GOING BIG.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.454
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
TWO BUDDIES AND A PIZZA. PFFT.
GEORGE?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.961
(men)
* HERE COME THE MANNEQUINS

03:47.995 --> 03:51.299
* AVERT YOUR EYES,
AVERT YOUR EYES *

03:51.332 --> 03:53.801
* TALL AND CRUEL AND TERRIBLE

03:53.834 --> 03:54.868
HMM.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.337
* NO COMMON GROUND,
NO COMMON GROUND *

03:56.370 --> 03:58.539
OH, DO YOU HEAR AN OBOE?

03:58.572 --> 03:59.907
WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY
SINGING ABOUT?

03:59.940 --> 04:02.510
I DON'T KNOW.
A, UH, I THINK A PROSTITUTE

04:02.543 --> 04:04.512
WHO BECOMES A...

04:04.545 --> 04:05.713
OOH.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.481
SCIENTIST OR SOMETHING.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.016
I COULDN'T FOLLOW.
(music stops)

04:09.049 --> 04:10.718
(grunts) WE'RE OLD.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.054
WE'RE NOT OLD. IT'S JUST...
THEY'RE NOT GOOD.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.856
(chuckles)
WE'RE OLD, GEORGE. WE ARE.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.625
I FOUND A GRAY CHEST HAIR
LAST WEEK.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.026
THAT--THAT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.530
YOUNG PEOPLE GET THOSE
ALL THE TIME. I LOOKED IT UP.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.964
(chuckles) HOW MUCH TIME
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE LEFT?

04:23.997 --> 04:25.466
WOULD YOU STOP IT?
(door closes)

04:25.499 --> 04:26.700
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
(engine starts)

04:26.734 --> 04:27.968
WE'RE YOUNG. WE'RE HEALTHY.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.937
I'M TAN.
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.573
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GORGEOUS, BUDDY!
(tires screech, engine revs)

04:32.606 --> 04:33.807
WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER!

04:33.841 --> 04:34.975
(tires peal)

04:35.008 --> 04:36.344
(chuckling)

04:39.547 --> 04:40.748
(crack)
OW!

04:40.781 --> 04:42.716
(thud)
OW!

04:42.750 --> 04:45.118
AAH! OHH!

04:45.152 --> 04:48.021
AAH, AAH. OHH. (groans)

04:48.055 --> 04:49.323
IS IT A BEE STING?
A CUT?

04:49.357 --> 04:50.558
DID YOU TOUCH POISON IVY?

04:50.591 --> 04:51.625
IS IT A FEVER?
A RASH?

04:51.659 --> 04:52.526
ARE YOU CHOKING?

04:52.560 --> 04:53.627
(loudly)
CAN YOU SPEAK?

04:53.661 --> 04:54.928
YES. NO. DON'T TOUCH--

04:54.962 --> 04:57.565
DON'T TOUCH ME, PLEASE.
IT'S MY BACK.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.368
IT'S OKAY, GEORGE. I'M HERE.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.771
LADIES, YOU CAN GO NOW.
I'VE GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.540
OH. OKAY.
IT'LL BE FINE.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.442
I SAID I'VE GOT THIS, LUCILLE!
(gasps)

05:10.378 --> 05:11.679
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.419
TESSA?

05:18.452 --> 05:22.656
DON'T TELL ME. YOU DIDN'T GET
THE BAND, DID YOU?

05:22.690 --> 05:24.392
NO...

05:24.425 --> 05:27.027
BUT... I GOT THE BAND!

05:27.060 --> 05:28.896
YOU GOT AVERAGE SHELF LIFE?

05:28.929 --> 05:31.699
AVERAGE SHELF LIFE?
THAT'S THE BAND YOU WANTED?

05:31.732 --> 05:32.165
YEAH.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.435
SHOOT...

05:34.468 --> 05:36.136
'CAUSE...
THAT'S THE BAND I GOT!

05:36.169 --> 05:37.638
STOP DOING THAT!

05:37.671 --> 05:39.540
NOW ALL YOU NEED IS
A TOP-NOTCH PARTY PLANNER

05:39.573 --> 05:42.075
TO WHIP IT TOGETHER IN TIME,
AND I KNOW SOMEONE

05:42.109 --> 05:46.914
WHO'S SMART, STYLISH,
WELL-CONNECTED,

05:46.947 --> 05:49.617
AND HAPPENS TO BE STANDING
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.019
WOW. YOU'D REALLY HELP
PLAN MY PARTY, TOO?

05:52.052 --> 05:54.655
ME? NO.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.859
DALIA.

05:58.892 --> 05:59.760
HEY.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.796
OH. PFFT. NO. (chuckles)

06:02.830 --> 06:04.532
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.899
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, TESSA.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.869
EVER SINCE DALIA FAILED
HER CAREER APTITUDE TEST,

06:08.902 --> 06:11.505
HER DAD'S BEEN LEANING ON ME
TO MAKE SURE SHE HAS ONE.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.440
A CAREER?

06:12.473 --> 06:15.175
AN APTITUDE, AND I'M
PRETTY SURE THIS IS IT.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.810
IT IS.
IT'S IT!

06:16.844 --> 06:20.047
PLUS I'D CONSIDER THIS
A REAL SOLID,

06:20.080 --> 06:21.715
WHICH I DON'T MIND
ASKING YOU FOR,

06:21.749 --> 06:25.052
BEING AS THAT I JUST DID YOU
AN EVEN REALER SOLID

06:25.085 --> 06:27.220
WITH THE WHOLE BAND THING
AND ALL.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.857
(inhales deeply)
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.693
WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT,
HOW CAN I SAY NO?

06:32.726 --> 06:35.463
YOU CAN'T! AAH!

06:35.496 --> 06:36.530
(singsongy) MM-HMM.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.231
(school bell rings)

06:38.265 --> 06:39.933
I HAD A FEW THOUGHTS...
MM-HMM.

06:39.967 --> 06:43.203
SORT OF A JUMPING-OFF POINT
OF HOW I WANT MY PARTY TO LOOK.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.640
WAIT. LET ME GET A PENCIL.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.809
I COULDN'T THINK
OF A SINGLE WORSE PERSON

06:48.842 --> 06:50.210
TO PLAN MY PARTY,

06:50.243 --> 06:55.182
BUT AT LEAST DALIA SEEMED
WILLING TO LISTEN.

06:55.215 --> 06:58.018
(scratching)

06:59.820 --> 07:01.188
OKAY. READY.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.024
OKAY, UH...
(exhales deeply)

07:04.057 --> 07:07.027
WHEN I WAS LIVING IN NEW YORK,
MY FRIEND OSKAR HAD THIS...

07:07.060 --> 07:08.596
ROOFTOP SOIREE,

07:08.629 --> 07:11.999
WHERE THEY, UH, GRILLED
YAKITORI ON A HIBACHI.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.502
YEAH, I DON'T LIKE
ANY OF THOSE WORDS,

07:14.535 --> 07:17.505
SO, LISTEN,
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.674
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S GONNA BE
AT THE COUNTRY CLUB.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.877
I'M THINKING
MONOCHROMATIC, TWO-TONE COLORS

07:23.911 --> 07:25.679
WITH A BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT COLORS.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.047
I ALSO WANT TO HAVE
A PONY STATION,

07:27.080 --> 07:28.882
WHERE YOU CAN TAKE PICTURES
WITH A PONY.

07:28.916 --> 07:32.486
YEP, DALIA WAS LISTENING,
ALL RIGHT, BUT ONLY TO HERSELF.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.522
NOW LET'S TALK GO-GO CAGES.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.957
I DON'T WANT GO-GO CAGES
AT MY PARTY.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.225
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY HAVE TO BE IN CAGES.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.260
WHEN I WAS A BOY,
WOMEN DANCED FREE-RANGE.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.930
I CAN'T BELIEVE I AGREED
TO LET DALIA PLAN MY PARTY.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.197
TRUST ME, YEARS FROM NOW,

07:44.231 --> 07:45.866
ALL YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER
IS THE GOOD STUFF,

07:45.899 --> 07:49.236
THAT THE BAND YOU LOVE
PLAYED AT YOUR 16th BIRTHDAY.

07:49.269 --> 07:52.272
I GOT MONO ON MY 16th BIRTHDAY,
AND THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER

07:52.305 --> 07:54.241
IS KISSING
THE GIRL WHO GAVE IT TO ME.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.175
WHAT WAS HER NAME?

07:55.208 --> 07:56.143
I DON'T REMEMBER.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.210
BECAUSE IT WAS
9 MILLION YEARS AGO?

07:57.244 --> 07:59.580
YES, BECAUSE IT WAS
9 MILLION YEARS AGO.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.948
YOU'RE GETTING MEANER
IN YOUR OLD AGE.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.183
DO YOU KNOW THAT?
AH-HA. AAH.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.885
EASY, EASY, EASY.

08:04.918 --> 08:05.919
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.220
(exhales deeply)

08:07.254 --> 08:11.324
TESSA, YOUR FATHER IS STILL
IN THE SHEILA SHAY I.C.U.,

08:11.358 --> 08:14.094
ANDSEE YOU...
ARE DISTURBING HIM.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.929
(pills rattle)

08:15.963 --> 08:17.264
HERE'S YOUR PILL, GEORGE.

08:17.297 --> 08:17.698
THANK YOU.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.232
OH, POOR THING.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.968
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW...

08:21.001 --> 08:22.570
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE
DONE WITHOUT YOU, SHEILA.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.605
YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DIED.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.707
(chuckles)
(doorbell rings)

08:26.740 --> 08:28.275
(whispers) I'LL GET THAT.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.743
YEAH. OHH.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.612
(sighs) THAT WOMAN
HAS BEEN AMAZING.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.782
PROMISE ME SHE HASN'T
GIVEN YOU A SPONGE BATH.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.717
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU
ANYTHING. (sighs)

08:36.750 --> 08:39.720
WHAT ARE YOU TAKING?

08:39.753 --> 08:41.755
PAIN PILLS
FROM SHEILA'S HYSTERECTOMY.

08:41.789 --> 08:42.489
DID YOU KNOW THEY SAVED

08:42.522 --> 08:45.192
TWO-THIRDS
OF ONE OF HER OVARIES?

08:45.225 --> 08:46.259
EXCUSE ME.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.629
I'M GONNA GO WATCH A DOCUMENTARY
ABOUT DOLPHIN MURDER

08:48.662 --> 08:51.031
SO I CAN FORGET THAT IMAGE.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.066
HELLO, DALLAS.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.136
HI... SHEILA. I BROUGHT GEORGE
SOME CHICKEN SOUP.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.371
MY HOUSEKEEPER MADE IT,
BUT I PAID FOR THE INGREDIENTS.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.174
OH, HOW NICE. I'LL DEFINITELY
SEE THAT HE GETS IT.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.845
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT
TO HIM MYSELF AND SAY HI.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.814
THAT'S SWEET THAT YOU THINK
HE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU,

09:06.847 --> 09:08.749
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE
TO SAY NO.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.884
(lowered voice)
DON'T DO THIS, SHEILA.

09:10.918 --> 09:11.885
NOT AGAIN.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.854
I AM SURE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.757
OH, PLEASE. YOU MOTHER
UNTIL YOU SMOTHER.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.392
I DID NOT KILL
TOM JESPERSON!

09:19.426 --> 09:21.695
OH, NO? IT WAS JUST YOU THERE
FOR THREE AND A HALF WEEKS,

09:21.729 --> 09:22.763
TAKING CARE OF HIM.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.331
HE NEEDED HELP.
HE HAD SCIATICA!

09:24.364 --> 09:25.599
YOU DON'T DIE OF SCIATICA!

09:25.633 --> 09:27.400
VISITING HOURS ARE OVER!

09:27.434 --> 09:29.603
(door slams)

09:32.873 --> 09:34.274
UGH!

09:34.307 --> 09:37.010
RELAX.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.347
MOMMY'S HERE.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.453
SO AT WHAT POINT IN THE PARTY
WERE YOU THINKING OF DOING

09:46.486 --> 09:50.323
THE FREEZE DANCE?
YEAH, 'CAUSE I JUST GOT
THE ROBOT DOWN, SO...

09:50.357 --> 09:53.794
SORRY, GUYS.
THERE'S NO FREEZE DANCE.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.195
I KNEW IT.
THREE DAYS WASTED.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.964
IT NEVER HURTS
TO PRACTICE, RIGHT?

09:56.997 --> 09:58.231
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS,
LISA.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.167
ALL RIGHT, BEEYOTCH.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.803
TIME TO GO DRESS SHOPPING
FOR YOUR PARTY.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.037
AND IF I DECLINE?

10:04.071 --> 10:06.907
THEN YOU WON'T SEE
YOUR BAND AGAIN... ALIVE.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.710
YOU MEAN "LIVE."

10:09.743 --> 10:12.813
(sighs)

10:12.846 --> 10:14.715
SEE YOU GUYS LATER,
APPARENTLY.

10:16.950 --> 10:21.889
(imitates Dalia) "IT'S TIME
TO GO DRESS SHOPPING, BEEYOTCH."

10:21.922 --> 10:23.824
CAN THEY JUST LEAVE SCHOOL
LIKE THAT?

10:23.857 --> 10:25.893
PROBABLY NOT. WE HAVE,
LIKE, FOUR PERIODS LEFT.

10:25.926 --> 10:26.960
YEAH.

10:26.994 --> 10:30.698
(singsongy) WAKE UP.
WAKEY, WAKEY.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.699
HUH?

10:31.732 --> 10:33.200
YOU'VE GOT A VISITOR,
SLEEPY PUSS.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.036
(laughing) HEY, BUDDY.
LOOK WHO'S SLEEPING ON THE JOB.

10:36.069 --> 10:36.870
(mumbles)

10:36.904 --> 10:38.739
(chuckles) OHH.
HE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.207
POOR BUNNY.
HE CAN BARELY TALK.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.208
I CAN BAHK.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.711
SHH, SHH.
BUDDY, BUDDY, BUDDY.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.278
(chuckles) HERE. SCOOT OVER.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.748
JUST LISTEN TO ME,
ALL RIGHT?

10:47.781 --> 10:50.984
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
MOVE A SOFA.

10:51.018 --> 10:54.021
(laughing) I'M KIDDING.
I'M KIDDING.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.223
BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW
HOW YOU ARE THROWING

10:56.256 --> 10:58.058
THAT SWEET 16 PARTY
FOR TESSA?

10:58.091 --> 11:00.093
(clank)

11:00.127 --> 11:01.294
SHE'S GONNA KILL ME.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.097
I KNOW. THESE THINGS
CAN BE EXPENSIVE,

11:04.131 --> 11:06.967
BUT I WAS THINKING,
BECAUSE I'M A COSMETIC DENTIST

11:07.000 --> 11:09.336
AND THIS PARTY IS GONNA BE
CRAWLING WITH INSECURE TEENAGERS

11:09.369 --> 11:11.338
WITH ALL KINDS
OF DENTAL NEEDS,

11:11.371 --> 11:14.842
WHAT IF MY PRACTICE
SPONSORED THE EVENT?

11:14.875 --> 11:15.776
(weakly) HELP ME.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.912
EXACTLY. I'LL HELP YOU,
WHICH WILL HELP ME.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.413
IT'S A WIN-WIN.
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.282
I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA
LET YOU HEAL UP, OKAY?

11:22.315 --> 11:23.216
(whimpers)

11:23.250 --> 11:25.252
YOU TAKE CARE. WHAT?!
OHH!

11:25.285 --> 11:27.320
(laughs) YOU FLINCHED.
THAT'S ON YOU.

11:27.354 --> 11:31.091
HEY, SHEILA. TAKE CARE
OF MY BOY, WOULD YA?

11:31.124 --> 11:33.794
NO... WAIT.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.929
I THINK I FOUND
SOME DRESSES TO TRY ON.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.064
THE ONE WITH THE BUTTONS
IS DOABLE,

11:37.097 --> 11:39.199
BUT, MM, I DON'T KNOW.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.500
LET ME SEE.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.169
(hangers clatter)

11:42.202 --> 11:43.303
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

11:43.336 --> 11:44.504
THEY'RE DIRT-COLORED.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.373
THE COLOR OF DIRT DOESN'T
LOOK GOOD ON PEOPLE.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.441
THEY'RE NOT DIRT-COLORED.
THEY'RE BROWN,

11:48.475 --> 11:50.143
AND IT'S THE COLOR
THAT I WANT TO WEAR.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.211
OOH, BAD CHOICE.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.313
I GAVE YOU THE "TAKE
YOUR PICTURE WITH A PONY" BOOTH,

11:53.346 --> 11:55.348
SO GIVE THIS ONE TO ME.
IT'S MY PARTY.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.985
YEAH, YOUR "NON-BAND PARTY
THAT WON'T HAVE A BAND

11:58.018 --> 12:01.454
UNLESS YOU WEAR THE DRESS
I PICKED OUT FOR YOU... PARTY,"

12:01.488 --> 12:03.857
SO GO TRY ON THE DRESS
I PICKED OUT FOR YOU.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.759
IT'S IN THE TINY ROOM.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.060
(pop dance music playing)

12:07.094 --> 12:09.797
(woman) * HEADING TO THE CLUB,
I FEEL LIKE DANCING *

12:09.830 --> 12:12.199
(curtain rings swoosh)
* I FEEL LIKE DANCING,
I'M-A LET MY HAIR DOWN *

12:12.232 --> 12:14.034
* I'M-A DO SOME SWEATIN',
DO SOME SWEATIN' *

12:14.067 --> 12:16.569
BROWN IS ONE
OF YOUR BASIC COLORS.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.239
(sighs) BASIC BROWN.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.374
THAT'S A THING. GOD.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.543
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT I LOOK GOOD IN

12:23.576 --> 12:25.145
OR WHAT I LIKE.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.479
**

12:26.513 --> 12:28.115
(curtain rings swoosh)

12:28.148 --> 12:31.018
SEE? YOU LOOK GOOD.

12:31.051 --> 12:35.455
**

12:35.488 --> 12:40.193
(Tessa) I DID LOOK GOOD,
REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY,

12:40.227 --> 12:42.362
BUT I WASN'T ABOUT TO GIVE
DALIA THE SATISFACTION

12:42.395 --> 12:44.231
OF KNOWING I FELT THAT WAY.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.000
I'M GONNA LOOK SO PRETTY
NEXT TO THAT PONY.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.512
WOW. LOOK AT YOU.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.414
DON'T START CRYING, GEORGE.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.818
IF YOU CRY, IT'LL MAKE IT SEEM
MUCH MORE COLD WHEN I LEAVE YOU.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.553
WISH I COULD BE THERE.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.222
ME, TOO, OLD MAN,

13:09.256 --> 13:12.359
BUT AS SOON
AS THE FUN STUFF'S OVER,

13:12.392 --> 13:14.094
I'LL COME VISIT YOU
AT THE HOME.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.563
OKAY, BUT DON'T COME AFTER 7:00.
WE'RE HAVING BLENDED CARROTS

13:16.596 --> 13:19.099
AND WATCHING
"FATHER DOWLING MYSTERIES."

13:24.337 --> 13:29.509
THANKS FOR DOING THIS, DAD.
I PROMISE I'LL TAKE PICTURES.

13:29.542 --> 13:30.878
YOU'D BETTER.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.651
THEY GROW UP SO FAST.

13:38.685 --> 13:39.352
OW.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.453
HERE YOU GO.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.962
ATTABOY.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.130
(sighs)

13:52.665 --> 13:54.601
NOW CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.605
US OLD-TIMERS NEED
OUR REST.

14:01.108 --> 14:04.077
GEORGE WASN'T ABOUT TO GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

14:04.111 --> 14:07.380
HE STILL HAD ONE THING LEFT
TO DO ON HIS BUCKET LIST.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.449
NOT THIS OLD-TIMER, SHEILA.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.188
NORMALLY,
I'M NOT THE KIND OF GIRL...

14:15.222 --> 14:16.256
WHOA.
WHO'D BE IMPRESSED

14:16.289 --> 14:18.558
BY GIANT SNOWFLAKES, LASERS...

14:18.591 --> 14:20.427
(dance music playing)

14:20.460 --> 14:24.531
THAT GUY, AND THE TERM
"SWEET 16" MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL,

14:24.564 --> 14:27.567
BUT IT WAS PRETTY SWEET,
AND I WAS 16,

14:27.600 --> 14:29.169
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.438
I OWED DALIA
A MASSIVE THANK-YOU.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.406
YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.408
HELLO?

14:35.442 --> 14:37.077
CARE FOR A TESSA-TINI?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.112
OH, UH,
WHAT'S IN A TESSA-TINI?

14:39.146 --> 14:42.249
GRAPE SODA, BLACK TEA,
AND JUST A SPLASH OF BEET JUICE.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.985
IT SOUNDS AWFUL,
BUT IT TASTES DELICIOUS. NO.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.086
**

14:46.119 --> 14:48.255
IT'LL STAIN THE HELL
OUT OF YOUR TEETH.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.691
(laughs) IT'S A DENTIST'S DREAM.
HEY, DRINK UP, EVERYBODY!

14:51.724 --> 14:53.660
THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT
CAME FROM.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.429
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

14:56.463 --> 15:01.034
HAVE A GOOD TIME, TESSA.
TONIGHT IS YOUR NIGHT...

15:01.068 --> 15:03.136
AND MINE...

15:03.170 --> 15:05.338
AND YOURS!

15:05.372 --> 15:07.474
(whispers) AND MINE.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.176
(Noah) WHOO-HOO!

15:09.209 --> 15:12.012
**

15:12.045 --> 15:13.113
HEY, KIMANTHA.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.414
(Noah) ALL RIGHT! WHOO-HOO!

15:14.447 --> 15:15.682
HAVE YOU SEEN
LISA AND MALIK?

15:15.715 --> 15:18.218
NO. HAVE YOU SEEN
"THE THIN RED LINE"?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.519
NO.
I JUST RENTED IT.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.022
IT REALLY IS EMOTIONALLY
RIVETING. (giggles)

15:24.091 --> 15:27.027
(cheering)

15:30.330 --> 15:31.731
HEY, DALIA.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.532
WHOA.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.466
YEAH, WHOA.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.035
EXACTLY. WHOA.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.070
YOU GUYS CAN'T BE HERE.
THE FIRE MARSHAL JUST CAME

15:37.104 --> 15:39.172
AND SAID
WE'RE AT FULL INTENSITY.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.374
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
SAYING?

15:41.408 --> 15:42.409
GO HOME, LADIES.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.444
I'M NOT A LA--

15:44.477 --> 15:46.513
PICK YOUR BATTLES, MALIK.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.253
(singsongy) WAKEY, WAKEY!

15:53.286 --> 15:55.055
TIME TO FRESHEN UP.

15:55.088 --> 15:59.059
GEORGE. GEORGIE.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.661
TIME TO WAKE UP. (gasps) AAH!

16:01.694 --> 16:03.663
GEORGE?

16:03.696 --> 16:07.100
GEORGE! GEORGE ALTMAN!

16:07.134 --> 16:09.036
GEORGE ALTMAN, WHERE ARE YOU?!

16:09.069 --> 16:11.304
(grunts)
(engine starts)

16:11.338 --> 16:13.406
GO! AAH!

16:13.440 --> 16:16.209
I LEFT AS SOON AS I GOT
YOUR TEXT. ARE YOU OKAY?

16:16.243 --> 16:19.212
DRIVE! GO! FASTER!

16:19.246 --> 16:21.681
I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN!
IT'S A RESIDENTIAL ZONE, GEORGE.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.817
I GOT TWO SPEEDING TICKETS
HERE LAST MONTH.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.187
HEY, HEY.

16:27.220 --> 16:31.424
HEY, CALL ME.
I CAN FIX THAT. HMM?

16:31.458 --> 16:35.828
HEY, YOU HAVE AN OVERBITE.
CALL ME. OH, EXCUSE ME.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.697
OH, JACKPOT! (chuckles)

16:37.730 --> 16:40.300
LOOK AT THOSE CHOMPERS.
ARE YOU FROM WALES?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.634
CALL ME.

16:41.668 --> 16:46.206
**

16:46.239 --> 16:47.374
HEY, HAVE YOU--

16:47.407 --> 16:48.775
I DON'T CARE
IF THE PONY IS TIRED.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.378
THAT THING IS NOT GOING
BACK TO THE FARM.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.379
WHAT?

16:52.412 --> 16:53.846
HAVE YOU SEEN
MALIK AND LISA?

16:53.880 --> 16:55.548
NOT SINCE I SENT THEM HOME.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.150
YOU SENT MY FRIENDS HOME?

16:57.184 --> 17:00.153
YEAH, THEY WEREN'T REALLY PART
OF MY VISION FOR THIS PARTY.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.222
IT'S MY PARTY!

17:02.255 --> 17:05.225
THEN LEAVE AND GO FIND
YOUR LAME FRIENDS. I DON'T CARE.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.759
(voice amplified) HELLO.
(feedback whines)

17:06.793 --> 17:09.229
WE'RE AVERAGE SHELF LIFE,
AND THIS IS

17:09.262 --> 17:13.233
FOR THE BIRTHDAY GIRL,
TESSA FALTMAN.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.702
HE SAID MY NAME...
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TESSA!

17:15.735 --> 17:17.137
PRACTICALLY.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.338
("Radio" playing)

17:24.877 --> 17:27.547
* IF I HAD A RADIO

17:27.580 --> 17:30.583
* FOR EVERY TIME
YOU LOVED ME SO *

17:30.617 --> 17:32.619
* I WOULDN'T HAVE A RADIO
AT ALL *

17:36.856 --> 17:39.626
* NOW I SIT AND WASTE MY TIME

17:39.659 --> 17:40.327
I LOVE YOU!

17:40.360 --> 17:42.895
* MY ROOM IS QUIET AS A MIME

17:42.929 --> 17:46.766
* AND WAIT FOR SOMEONE GLAMOROUS
TO CALL *

17:46.799 --> 17:49.336
(oboe solo plays)

17:49.369 --> 17:50.337
* RADIO

17:50.370 --> 17:51.171
THIS MUSIC SUCKS.

17:51.204 --> 17:55.508
* RADIO, RADIO

17:55.542 --> 17:56.843
AAH! AAH! (whimpers)

17:56.876 --> 17:59.379
OH, I'M SORRY.
DO YOU WANT ME TO SLOW DOWN?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.714
NO, NO, NO. JUST GET THERE.
I DON'T WANT TO MISS THE PARTY.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.215
(cell phone rings)

18:02.249 --> 18:04.417
(gasps) IT'S SHEILA.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.654
DON'T ANSWER THAT!
HEY, DON'T ANSWER THAT, OKAY?

18:07.687 --> 18:09.456
SHE--THAT WOMAN WAS TRYING
TO KILL ME,

18:09.489 --> 18:11.658
JUST LIKE SHE KILLED
TOM JESPERSON.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.793
(laughs) OH, NO, NO, NO.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.795
SHE DIDN'T KILL
OLD MAN JESPERSON.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.432
HE WAS 94 WHEN HE BIT IT.
I JUST LIKE MESSING WITH HER.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.768
OHH. DALLAS, YOU CAN'T MAKE
THOSE KIND OF JOKES

18:21.801 --> 18:24.471
AROUND A MAN TAKING LEFTOVER
HYSTERECTOMY MEDICATION.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.572
(car rattles)
AAH!

18:25.605 --> 18:26.373
OHH.
OH. ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO SLOW DOWN?

18:26.406 --> 18:29.242
(rattling)
NO, JUST KEEP GOING. AAH!

18:29.276 --> 18:32.312
* HURRICANE, HURRICANE

18:32.345 --> 18:37.484
TESSA! THERE'S LOTS OF HEADS,
LOTS OF HEADS UP IN THIS PIECE.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.551
OW!

18:38.585 --> 18:39.719
(cheering)

18:43.423 --> 18:45.425
NOAH WAS RIGHT.
THERE WERE A LOT OF HEADS,

18:45.458 --> 18:50.330
BUT NONE OF THOSE HEADS
WERE MY FRIENDS'... HEADS.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.365
COULD I HAVE FELT ANY WORSE?

18:52.399 --> 18:53.900
(feedback whines)

18:53.933 --> 18:56.269
ALL RIGHT. THIS NEXT ONE'S

18:56.303 --> 18:58.405
ABOUT THE DANGERS
OF SURROUNDING YOURSELF

18:58.438 --> 19:00.740
WITH PHONY PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T YOUR FRIENDS.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.675
APPARENTLY, I COULD.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.344
("Here Come The Mannequins"
playing)

19:04.377 --> 19:07.347
* HERE COME THE MANNEQUINS

19:07.380 --> 19:10.550
* AVERT YOUR EYES,
AVERT YOUR EYES *

19:10.583 --> 19:11.884
* TALL AND CRUEL AND TERRIBLE

19:11.918 --> 19:12.919
(Dalia) TESSA, WAIT.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.788
DON'T TRY AND STOP ME.
I'M GOING AFTER MY FRIENDS.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.890
NOBODY CARES.
TAKE OUR PICTURE.

19:17.924 --> 19:22.662
* ...AND ME,
THEY'RE AN AWFUL SIGHT TO SEE *

19:22.695 --> 19:23.730
SMILE.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.966
* AS THEY ORCHESTRATE
THE SYMPHONY *

19:26.999 --> 19:28.668
(camera shutter clicks)

19:28.701 --> 19:29.736
* WHOO

19:29.769 --> 19:30.903
THAT'S A KEEPER.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.542
GEORGE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:35.575 --> 19:37.810
HEY! I MADE IT. MWAH.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.879
I MADE IT TO YOUR BIRTHDAY.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

19:39.912 --> 19:42.315
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
IT'S AMAZING.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.383
(Dallas and George) WHOA!

19:43.416 --> 19:44.384
OH! (chuckles)

19:44.417 --> 19:45.985
(laughs)

19:46.018 --> 19:47.053
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

19:47.086 --> 19:50.523
WAIT. HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG?
DON'T YOU LIKE YOUR BAND?

19:50.557 --> 19:53.893
I LIKE MY FRIENDS MORE.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.262
LET'S GO, GEORGE.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.269
SEE, GEORGE?
THIS IS ALL I WANTED--

20:02.302 --> 20:05.004
PIZZA, A COUPLE OF FRIENDS.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.373
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST
LISTEN TO ME?

20:06.406 --> 20:07.740
I TRIED. I-I JUST--

20:07.774 --> 20:09.742
I COULDN'T HEAR YOU
THROUGH ALL THE EAR HAIR.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.910
GIFT TIME!

20:14.814 --> 20:15.948
(gasps)

20:18.618 --> 20:20.720
(gasps)

20:20.753 --> 20:23.290
WHOA.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.991
THESE ARE--

20:25.024 --> 20:26.359
DIAMONDS!

20:31.731 --> 20:33.900
THANK YOU?

20:33.933 --> 20:35.535
YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.605
(dance music playing)
THEY SAY DIAMONDS ARE
A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND,

20:38.638 --> 20:41.007
BUT IN MY CASE, IT WASN'T TRUE.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.945
THESE NERDS WERE.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.848
I FELT CLOSE TO THE DIAMONDS,
ALSO, THOUGH.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.016
(turns off music)

20:53.320 --> 20:54.987
ARE YOU GONNA
EMBARRASS ME NOW?

20:55.021 --> 20:56.356
MAYBE.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.326
MAYBE? DAD.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.760
COME ON. YOU'RE ONLY 16 ONCE.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.330
WE STILL NEED TO HAVE
OUR FATHER-DAUGHTER DANCE.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.365
LET'S GO.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.633
UH...

21:06.666 --> 21:08.735
I THINK THAT'S JUST
AT WEDDINGS.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.504
I MAY NOT MAKE IT
TO YOUR WEDDING.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.773
I WAS BORN
9 MILLION YEARS AGO.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.074
MM.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.377
(Dallas)
LOOK HOW CUTE YOU TWO ARE.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.511
(Amos Lee) * APPLE OF MY EYE

21:18.545 --> 21:20.580
* DON'T KNOW WHEN,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY *

21:20.613 --> 21:22.749
SHALL WE DANCE?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.917
* YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON

21:24.951 --> 21:27.720
* I KEEP ON COMING HOME
