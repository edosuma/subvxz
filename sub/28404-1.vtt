00:31.399 --> 00:33.298
STEVE: No, you know why?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.786
Surprise me.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.205
Because my wife is even
more beautiful than she

00:39.206 --> 00:40.606
was the day I met her.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.685
And you are still crazy.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.154
[laughs]

00:54.155 --> 00:56.555
Maybe, but that doesn't
mean I'm not right.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.667
You ready to see the world?

01:10.237 --> 01:12.371
I thought I was looking at it.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.178
I had a miracle
happen to me once.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.448
I think everyone
gets to have one,

01:23.818 --> 01:26.251
and I wouldn't trade
mine for anything.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.690
Sure you want to do this?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.394
Plenty of other ways to
spend our retirement.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.629
No, of course I'm sure.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.165
I mean, it's not practical.
We have no plan.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.534
I don't even know
where I'm going.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.703
That's not us.

01:44.839 --> 01:48.108
Well, we can just have fun.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.442
Remember fun?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.776
I might.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.346
What do you want to do?

01:55.850 --> 01:57.750
I don't know.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.551
I guess we could
do whatever we want.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.772
Yes yes.
I definitely want potatoes.

You should keep moving.

Hi.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.712
How was your shift today?

05:14.415 --> 05:15.580
It was fine.

Fine.

[chuckles]

05:17.918 --> 05:19.719
Is that the age we're at now?

Well, if you're doing it,
I want to hear about it.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.965
I serve potatoes.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.767
Hours of potatoes.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.501
It's crushingly boring.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.906
Absolutely.
How they treat you over there?

too friendly with you?

Nothing I can't handle.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.854
Oh, so they are?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.922
You know how I feel
about you dating.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.459
Who said I'm dating anyone?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.592
Really?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.494
Really.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.831
Or are you just too
shy to tell me about it?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.532
JAN: Really.

06:09.636 --> 06:10.970
Look.

You're beautiful, and I know
that you're gonna date.

I'm totally,
totally fine with it.

you don't date GIs.

No.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.960
Look, sweetie, I'm only saying
this because I care about you.

06:35.963 --> 06:40.900

Lachland, spending so much time

06:40.901 --> 06:43.669

06:47.641 --> 06:49.709

mothers and their sisters.

They forget how
to treat a woman.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.512
They're never gonna commit.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.049
They don't know how to handle a
relationship, and I know that

06:57.050 --> 06:59.951
sounds harsh, but this is
exactly why I have to tell you.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.924
I don't want anyone
hurting my little girl.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.867
Other than your sprained
shoulder, you're alright.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.639
You're very very fortunate,
this conversation could easily

07:53.640 --> 07:55.641
have not been happening.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.742
You're very lucky.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.144
When can I
see my husband?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.745
Your husband's still in surgery.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.848
Is he gonna be okay?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.918
He has a complete
spinal cord injury.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.125
What does that mean?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.095
Is-

08:16.096 --> 08:17.530
Is he paralyzed?

08:17.531 --> 08:18.964
Yes.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.168
But we'll know
more after surgery.

you want me to contact?

09:42.883 --> 09:44.683
Yeah.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.586
But he's in really bad shape.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.323
They're gonna tell me more
after he gets out of surgery.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.358
Okay.

for him and restore him.

would be able to release our

that you would drive out all

your word to heal him.

I talked to the EMTs.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.298
You were extremely lucky.

You know that.
It could've been much worse.

That's God.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.240
Okay.

Did they happen to give you
the name of dad's surgeon.

and it happened so fast,

11:21.915 --> 11:24.417

You know, they just
rushed him into surgery.

It's fine, It's fine.
I can find out.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.825
Did they give you any
like, discharge papers.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.060

you any paperwork?

know what they're doing.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.779
Mom, the problem is that
because I work in a hospital,

11:53.780 --> 11:57.183
unfortunately I know that some
doctors don't know what they're

11:57.184 --> 11:59.885
doing, so I'm just
gonna go talk to them.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.954

some information.

will be right back.

Seriously, what's your problem.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.857
My father won't approve.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.926
I'm not asking
you to marry him.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.393
Do you think he's cute.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.429
I think he's trouble.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.597
Yes or no.

13:51.598 --> 13:57.236
Some people might say he's
handsome in the right light

13:57.237 --> 13:58.838
when he's in uniform.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.206
So you do
think he's cute.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.909
Okay, fine yes, I think
he's somewhat cute, Okay?

14:03.910 --> 14:05.945
So then your father
doesn't have to know.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.179
You don't get it.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.948
He said if he
catches me dating a GI,

14:08.949 --> 14:11.150
he'll send me to live
with my grandma in Nebraska.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.918
Well, do you want
to go to Nebraska?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.621
No.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.023
Then I guess we'll
have to keep it a secret.

always meet another boy.

to go out with me.

a few more moments,

just let him rest.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.143
You're gonna be okay.

16:29.222 --> 16:32.190
[upbeat music]

16:36.296 --> 16:38.096
Can I take
you to the movies?

16:38.365 --> 16:39.597
No.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.739
What are you doing Monday?

16:46.740 --> 16:48.006
Washing my hair.

16:52.145 --> 16:52.745
Go for a walk?

16:52.746 --> 16:53.778
No.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.548
Your eyes are beautiful.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.715
Not a chance.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.586
Thursday?

17:00.587 --> 17:02.286
Washing my hair again.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.423
Friday?

17:04.424 --> 17:05.723
Doing laundry.

17:11.798 --> 17:12.798
Do you like me?

17:12.799 --> 17:13.799
Nope.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.669
Sunday.

17:20.673 --> 17:21.705
Maybe.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.575
Maybe is better than a no.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.117
MICHELE: So where are
we at post-surgery?

17:32.118 --> 17:35.120
Well, the medication is
keeping his heart going.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.121
Breathing on a respirator.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.359
I mean, his mind is still there.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.760
He's conscious.

17:41.761 --> 17:47.732
But he's paralyzed, and his
body's failing him everywhere.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.303
So, what happens next?

17:54.307 --> 17:56.575
We have some
tough decisions to make

17:56.576 --> 17:58.743
and he's only getting worse.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.450
Could you just give
us a few minutes to talk

18:04.451 --> 18:05.751
about it privately?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.618
Of course, of course.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.828
So he's gonna be
in a wheelchair, right?

18:15.829 --> 18:17.612
Mom.

18:17.613 --> 18:19.396
JAN: I'll learn to
take care of him.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.334
We have a one-story house.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.870
There are no stairs, we have a
walk-in shower already, we can

18:24.871 --> 18:27.639
make the whole place wheelchair
accessible, we can put a ramp.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.341
Thought I'd just-

18:29.342 --> 18:30.475
Mom.
Mom.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.211
What?

18:32.212 --> 18:34.580
I don't think you're
understanding.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.414
What am I not
understanding?

18:38.218 --> 18:39.817
You're scaring her.

18:40.854 --> 18:44.389
Okay, I just don't
think that you're hearing

18:44.390 --> 18:47.492
maybe what's actually happening.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.829
Dad isn't breathing on his own.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.269
His heart isn't
beating on its own, Okay?

18:57.270 --> 19:01.673
And so this is not just take
him home and buy a wheelchair.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.375
This is much more
serious than that.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.712
I heard what the doctor
said, I was listening.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.149
But he could improve.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.450
It's just not likely.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.755
Miracles can happen.
I should be in a hospital

19:16.756 --> 19:19.891
bed myself right now,
I should be, and I'm not.

19:20.894 --> 19:23.529
God kept me alive for a reason.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.197
We need to be praying for
your father right now.

19:27.433 --> 19:28.567
Mom, I'll pray with you.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.301
Okay, you're not helping her.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.605
I'm sorry, but a miracle
is not going to happen.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.375
Okay?

19:36.376 --> 19:39.311
He's just, he's not
going to get better.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.846
What happened to you?

19:40.847 --> 19:45.517
I'm just-I'm just trying to
be the grown-up at the table.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.419
Okay?

19:47.420 --> 19:51.590
Look, you can pray, and you
should, but all I want you to

19:51.591 --> 19:54.193
know is that praying
is not going to change a

19:54.194 --> 19:56.862
medical diagnosis, Okay?

19:56.863 --> 19:59.198
And I'd think a lawyer
should understand that!

19:59.199 --> 20:01.866
And I would expect you to
remember where we came from.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.735
JAN: Okay, girls.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.776
Sweetie.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.544
I know you're scared.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.878
It's okay.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.250
We have to place our faith in
God to watch over your father.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.554
You know that.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.470
Where are you going, young lady?

20:38.471 --> 20:40.339
I'm going to the
movies with Julie.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.373
I told mom.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.374
Mm-hmm.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.243
Alright, back before 10:00.

20:46.312 --> 20:47.379
I will.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.714
Just you and Julie, hm?

20:48.715 --> 20:49.915
JAN: Yes.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.317
You don't have to
interrogate her, honey.

20:52.318 --> 20:53.652
You sure?

20:53.653 --> 20:55.853
MARION: She wouldn't lie to us.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.956
I'll be back before 10:00.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.559
Alright.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.663
[door closes]

21:04.664 --> 21:06.030
Relax.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.436
What if he
tries to kiss you?

21:11.437 --> 21:12.904
I'm not gonna let him.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.340
Robbie kissed me
on our first date.

21:15.341 --> 21:16.741
That's because you're easy.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.446
I'm only doing this because
you pushed me into it.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.982
That's what you
need to tell yourself.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.652
By the end of the night I'm
gonna have to pull you off him.

21:26.653 --> 21:27.653
Not a chance.

21:27.654 --> 21:28.720
[chuckling]

21:28.721 --> 21:30.488
[music playing]

21:31.491 --> 21:32.590
Hi boys.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.058
Hey, girls.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.041
Should we go?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.979
I actually really
don't wanna see a movie.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.447
I'd rather just hang and talk.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.483
If that's okay.

22:00.053 --> 22:02.086
I'd love to
just sit and talk.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.390
Okay then.

22:05.391 --> 22:06.590
You two coming?

22:08.528 --> 22:09.795
You go ahead.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.763
Alright, you two have fun.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.030
[laughs]

22:17.003 --> 22:18.903
There's a little
park down this way.

22:28.681 --> 22:29.715
So.
You...

22:29.716 --> 22:31.382
I'm not making out with you.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.487
Who said you were?

22:35.488 --> 22:37.756
I know what "just sit
and talk," means to boys.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.791
No, not me.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.926
I just wanna get to know you.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.898
I hope you don't get into
trouble for sneaking

22:46.899 --> 22:48.733
out to see me like this.

22:49.102 --> 22:50.635
Robbie told me.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.036
It'll be fine.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.741
Look.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.410
I just think you're
beautiful, and cute.

22:58.411 --> 23:00.779
And I just wanna
spend time with you.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.012
Is that so awful?

23:03.116 --> 23:04.615
No, it's not.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.005
Good.

23:11.006 --> 23:13.023
It's just that my dad
used to train recruits.

23:14.127 --> 23:17.094
He told me what GIs were like.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.114
He's not wrong.

23:20.115 --> 23:22.435
There are a lot of guys who
don't know how to treat a lady.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.670
But I'm not one of those guys.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.716
So, Jan.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.150
What's your story?

23:39.886 --> 23:41.887
Unless you plan on being
a career lunch lady.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.655
No.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.824
I wanna go to college.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.758
I want a real career.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.828
But my parents always
say I'm just a girl.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.497
They actually say that?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.534
Yeah.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.901
My mom says it a lot.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.938
Well, you're
not just a girl to me.

24:05.812 --> 24:09.079
My mom, we have some
things we disagree on, too.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.784
That's sort of why I
joined the Air Force.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.151
To get away?

24:15.021 --> 24:16.620
Maybe.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.124
Do you like it?

24:19.125 --> 24:20.992
I do.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.994
It's not like back home.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.831
If you say you're gonna
do something, you do it.

24:25.832 --> 24:29.034
People are responsible for
their actions, no accountable.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.202
That's why I like it.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.838
You sound like my dad.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.608
Sorry?

24:36.609 --> 24:38.242
That's not always a bad thing.

24:40.646 --> 24:41.947
Oh, shoot, what time is it?

24:41.948 --> 24:43.548
Why?

24:43.549 --> 24:46.951
I promised my
dad I'd be home early.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.855
I have a question.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.724
Please don't lie to me.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.759
Okay.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.231
Do you have a girlfriend?

24:59.232 --> 25:00.799
What?

25:00.800 --> 25:03.201
Where did that come from?

25:03.202 --> 25:05.837
Some guys think it's okay
to talk to more than one girl

25:05.838 --> 25:07.104
at a time.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.174
I'm not one of those guys.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.812
You are the only girl
I wanna be talking to.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.653
ROBBIE: Last call, Romeo.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.021
Robbie!

25:23.022 --> 25:24.522
[Robbie laughs]

25:25.191 --> 25:26.658
JULIE: Sorry.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.894
We really do have
to go though, Jan.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.962
We're already late, my mom
will be waiting up for me.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.031
JAN: Why didn't you
come get me sooner?

25:33.032 --> 25:36.034
Robbie and I-talked-a
little in the theater after

25:36.035 --> 25:37.568
the movie finished.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.705
Yeah, we had a really
nice-talk in there.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.776
Seems like you two were
about to talk, too.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.645
Bye.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.847
Can I call you sometime?

25:50.983 --> 25:52.116
Okay.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.051
ROBBIE: Later, babe.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.324
JULIE: Come on.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.061
Sorry man, I tried
to stall her for you.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.331
Jan, wait a second.
Wait a second.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.071
[kiss]

26:16.342 --> 26:17.841
Bye.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.076
Bye.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.780
[giggling]

26:23.049 --> 26:24.950
Yeah! Good one.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.318
Yeah.

26:26.319 --> 26:27.785
Come on.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.689
Nice one, dude! You did it!

26:32.224 --> 26:33.791
STEVE: Get out of here.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.134
DOCTOR: He's awake,
and responsive.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.703
That's great!

26:44.704 --> 26:47.038
I told you God
was watching after him.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.074
The sedative wore off, mom.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.910
Can you please just try
to be a little upbeat?

26:51.911 --> 26:53.677
I'm just saying,
that's why he's awake.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.114
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey,
what are you doing?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.882
No, no, no.

26:57.883 --> 26:59.767
You have a strained shoulder,
you have to put that back on.

26:59.768 --> 27:01.653
I don't want your
father worrying about me.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.755
There's a reason they told you
to wear it in the first place,

27:03.756 --> 27:05.623
I mean he's not...
Okay.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.412
Come on, let's go see
him. Here, I got this.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.166
Hey there.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.272
TERRI: Dad.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.044
Daddy.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.850
MICHELE: Mom, he
can't feel his arms.

27:34.253 --> 27:37.655
But if you wanted
to touch him on his face,

27:39.058 --> 27:41.258
above his chin,
he can feel there.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.233
I'm here.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.371
TERRI: You look good.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.109
We have been
praying for you non-stop.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.244
God is protecting you.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.120
Sweetheart, I love you.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.395
Now who's easy?

28:17.396 --> 28:19.164
Stop it.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.605
I thought you
weren't gonna kiss him.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.001
He's not like the others.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.936
Why, because
he told you so?

28:24.937 --> 28:27.205
It's not that he told me,

28:27.206 --> 28:29.473
it's how he looked
at me when he said it.

28:31.444 --> 28:33.410
I don't know, I
can't explain it.

28:34.413 --> 28:39.016
Something about the way he
looks at me, I understand him.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.353
I think you're
gonna see him again.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.789
I might.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.170
We had a really good
time at the movies.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.172
We got ice cream after.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.907
Well it's almost 11:00.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.908
It was really
good ice cream.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.477
Really good.

29:07.012 --> 29:08.146
Okay.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.480
Good night.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.920
I looked like that
after our first date.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.054
Yeah.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.256
That's what worries me.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.225
[laughs]

29:22.261 --> 29:23.994
Relax.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.170
Delicious.

29:33.539 --> 29:34.938
Thank you, darling.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.977
I wanna have a friend
come eat with us sometime.

29:40.513 --> 29:41.780
Of course.

29:41.781 --> 29:42.980
Which friend?

29:44.283 --> 29:45.849
He's a college student.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.820
A college student you're dating?

29:49.989 --> 29:51.022
No.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.090
No, he's just a good friend.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.044
Right.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.063
We think it's great you want
your friends to come meet us

29:59.064 --> 30:01.465
honey, he's welcome anytime.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.202
Great.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.539
Great.

30:12.845 --> 30:15.847
Thank you Lord for these
gifts we are about to receive

30:15.848 --> 30:17.081
from your bounty.

30:17.082 --> 30:19.383
In Jesus' name, amen.

30:19.552 --> 30:20.185
MARION: Amen.

30:20.186 --> 30:20.885
JIM: Amen.

30:20.886 --> 30:22.019
Amen.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.289
JIM: Alright, Steve.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.026
Couldn't help but
notice your haircut.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.094
High and tight.

30:31.463 --> 30:32.896
I like keeping it short.

30:34.099 --> 30:35.199
Right.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.470
So, Steve,
where are you from?

30:40.940 --> 30:41.940
Los Angeles.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.942
Oh, we know lots
of people there.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.175
Where did you live?

30:45.911 --> 30:46.944
Brentwood.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.180
Mm-hmm. You a rich kid?

30:49.181 --> 30:51.148
STEVE: No, uhm,

30:51.550 --> 30:53.450
everything there
was my dad's, not mine.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.386
It's all gone now anyway.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.122
What, he blow it all?

31:00.192 --> 31:01.525
It's a long story.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.096
What about you?

31:05.097 --> 31:06.364
You have a job?

31:06.365 --> 31:07.899
Uhh...

31:07.900 --> 31:09.267
He's a college student.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.535
I told you that.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.035
Yes you did.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.173
And how did you two meet?

31:15.174 --> 31:16.307
STEVE: Well, we...

31:16.308 --> 31:18.208
He hangs out at
the ice cream parlor.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.045
JIM: Well, Steve,
I guess you can go home.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.146
Seems like Jan has all
the answers for you.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.016
She's a good listener.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.122
Steve might
tutor me in math.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.126
Why would he do that?

31:35.127 --> 31:37.095
So I can be
ready for college math.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.563
Oh, honey.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.564
Secretaries don't need math.

31:41.667 --> 31:45.035
Well maybe I don't
wanna be just a secretary.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.005
I see.

31:47.006 --> 31:50.575
So your mommy's job isn't
good enough for you,

31:50.576 --> 31:52.175
is that what you're saying?

31:52.444 --> 31:53.611
Never mind.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.646
This pot roast is
excellent, Mrs. Nichols.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.684
Thank you Steve.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.084
You're welcome.

32:11.196 --> 32:12.563
STEVE: Thank you so much.

32:12.564 --> 32:13.965
I'd be happy to clean up.

32:13.966 --> 32:15.233
Oh, don't be silly.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.068
No, that's
very kind of him.

32:17.069 --> 32:17.702
Go on, then.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.537
Jim!

32:19.538 --> 32:22.018
Well boy just got a free meal,
least he could do is the dishes.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.441
STEVE: I'd be happy to.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.410
JIM: Hop on it son.
Here you go.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.349
Hey, while you're at it, you
wanna give her a fill up there?

32:33.052 --> 32:34.052
Dad.

32:35.054 --> 32:35.954
Sure.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.120
Thank you.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.592
Too much.

32:48.233 --> 32:50.601
He seemed in
good spirits today.

32:50.602 --> 32:54.304
That's great, but unfortunately
medically, he's not improving.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.275
Does Steve have a living will?

33:01.347 --> 33:04.015
Why do they call it living
when it's only about dying?

33:04.016 --> 33:05.083
DOCTOR: But does he have one?

33:05.084 --> 33:06.184
JAN: Yeah.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.651
Who has power of attorney?

33:08.454 --> 33:09.987
JAN: I do.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.289
What would he want you to do?

33:13.425 --> 33:16.560
He'd wanna be given
every chance to live.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.731
To be here for his girls.

33:22.267 --> 33:24.769
He can react to us, I mean
that has to mean something,

33:24.770 --> 33:26.137
surely, doesn't it?

33:26.138 --> 33:27.771
Unfortunately it doesn't.

33:28.374 --> 33:31.274
But what if
there is any chance?

33:35.547 --> 33:37.331
And if there's not?

33:37.332 --> 33:39.417
The hospital would recommend
moving him to hospice.

33:39.418 --> 33:40.752
Why do we have to move him?

33:40.753 --> 33:42.473
He's been through enough
already, hasn't he?

33:43.188 --> 33:45.256
Ma'am, hospice is for...

33:45.257 --> 33:46.424
I know.
I know.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.059
I know what hospice is.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.694
My husband is not a
piece of furniture.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.229
Of course not.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.264
JAN: I feel like you
just want me to kill him...

33:53.265 --> 33:54.565
No, mom, no.

33:54.566 --> 33:55.533
JAN: Like you want me to
shut off the machines

33:55.534 --> 33:56.467
and the medicine.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.236
Mom.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.304
DOCTOR: I don't want you to
do anything you don't want to.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.373
But the fact of the matter is no
matter how well we take care of

34:02.374 --> 34:05.609
him, he'll never be able
to function on his own.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.478
He hates hospitals.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.047
He always has.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.520
We don't have to
discuss this now,

34:15.521 --> 34:18.089
but we do have to
make a decision.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.556
JAN: You can talk to me doctor.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.293
As I said, I have power of
attorney, and I will decide

34:22.293 --> 34:23.795
what happens to my husband.

34:23.795 --> 34:24.828
Of course.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.797
I think we
need to be alone.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.234
DOCTOR: You know about a
year ago, I lost my wife.

34:33.172 --> 34:36.773
And I didn't listen when the
hospital recommended hospice.

34:38.409 --> 34:42.813
But if I could do it all over
again, I know what I would do.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.657
Look, we can explore a lot
of different options on

34:52.658 --> 34:54.792
how to do this transition.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.494
I think maybe you
were right, sweetheart.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.732
I've been fooling myself.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.800
God's not helping
us on this one.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.370
Good job, Michele.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.674
Well-I-Mom.

35:11.510 --> 35:14.277
Hey, I didn't mean to-

35:15.247 --> 35:16.513
I'm sorry.

35:23.255 --> 35:26.124
JAN: He's taking
one night class,

35:26.125 --> 35:27.724
so technically I'm not lying.

35:29.595 --> 35:32.363
You don't see the way
that he looks at him.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.198
It's like he hates him.

35:34.199 --> 35:35.366
PASTOR ROBERT: But you love him.

35:35.367 --> 35:39.270
I... Well, we've only
been dating for six months.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.505
Why, did I say that I love him?

35:41.907 --> 35:43.340
You didn't have to.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.244
I just-

35:48.280 --> 35:50.648
I just want my
father to see him.

35:50.649 --> 35:54.618
Not the way that he thinks he
is, but the way that I see him.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.390
How long are you willing
to wait for that to happen?

36:01.293 --> 36:03.193
For as long as it takes.

36:05.764 --> 36:06.864
Then it will.

36:06.865 --> 36:10.600
But you'll struggle,
and you'll doubt it.

36:12.404 --> 36:15.205
Stay patient and eventually
you'll get there.

36:16.441 --> 36:17.707
How do you know that?

36:19.311 --> 36:20.711
I don't.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.746
I just have faith that it will.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.352
Let's pray.

36:32.624 --> 36:36.326
Heavenly Father, please be with
Jan in her time of trouble.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.501
Ehm-Mom?

36:43.502 --> 36:44.801
Someone's here to see you.

36:46.505 --> 36:49.206
PASTOR ROBERT: Well I guess I'll
just go back to California then.

36:50.475 --> 36:51.742
Who told you?

36:51.743 --> 36:52.877
Your daughter.

36:52.878 --> 36:53.945
JAN: Terri?

36:53.946 --> 36:54.978
No.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.216
MICHELE: Don't give
me too much credit,

36:58.217 --> 36:59.716
it was Terri's idea.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.586
I'm here to pray with you.

37:03.589 --> 37:06.289
I am sorry you traveled
so far to be with us.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.259
But God's not listening.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.793
God is always listening.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.796
No, He isn't.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.331
He isn't.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.932
I thought He did.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.634
But right now when we need
Him the most, He's not here.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.937
He's not listening to
what I have to say,

37:19.938 --> 37:21.504
He's stopped listening.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.519
Sorry I wasted your time.

37:36.989 --> 37:39.422
It's not a waste
for me to be here.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.960
Is there any reason you
chose to come in here?

37:48.367 --> 37:50.835
Just wanted to be
alone, I guess.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.004
Oh, well, I'll leave
you to it then.

37:53.005 --> 37:53.938
[sighs]

37:53.939 --> 37:56.406
No, sorry.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.743
Please stay.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.647
I got the feeling you're
not spending much time in

38:02.648 --> 38:03.847
chapels these days.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.384
MICHELE: No, I guess not.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.954
I'm not preaching to you,
it's just an observation.

38:13.325 --> 38:15.559
But it is a bit funny
though, you called me

38:15.560 --> 38:17.360
and you coming here.

38:17.929 --> 38:20.330
There are other places
you could go to be alone.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.600
It's just a
coincidence I suppose.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.070
Yeah, it is.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.308
You know, your mother's
been praying with me

38:30.309 --> 38:31.876
since she was young.

38:31.877 --> 38:34.344
I saw you when you were
just a little girl.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.946
I know you were
raised in church.

38:37.883 --> 38:41.452
And I also know you seem
to have a mind of your own,

38:41.453 --> 38:42.652
and that's a good thing.

38:44.656 --> 38:45.589
Yeah?

38:45.590 --> 38:46.857
Definitely.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.526
She does, too.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.461
Always did.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.429
You got that from her.

38:54.933 --> 38:58.469
But sometimes you get
preached something so much

38:58.470 --> 39:02.372
it feels good to make your
own decisions, and you should.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.776
I have.

39:07.913 --> 39:10.647
And it just feels safer to shut
out what you can't control.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.616
But that makes for a cold world.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.821
And I think the world is
warm, and full of love.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.691
If we just open
ourselves up to it.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.529
I'm gonna pray for
your father now.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.965
You can just listen if you like.

39:27.966 --> 39:31.502
Father God, we ask
you in the name of Jesus,

39:31.503 --> 39:33.937
we ask you right now
Father, for a miracle.

39:35.407 --> 39:38.676
The Bible says that where two or
more are gathered in agreement

39:38.677 --> 39:41.111
on a thing, that thing
shall take place.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.582
So we ask you Father
right now for a miracle for

39:44.583 --> 39:46.549
our brother Steve.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.487
We ask that you bring comfort to
this family, to the hearts of

39:49.488 --> 39:51.689
those that love him.

39:51.690 --> 39:55.626
We ask, God, that you reveal
yourself to be God to those who

39:55.627 --> 39:59.463
doubt, and give strength
to those who feel weak.

39:59.464 --> 40:02.066
We know you are able, God.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.702
We know that you've made us
those promises, and God you are

40:04.703 --> 40:07.671
good at keeping your promises.

40:07.672 --> 40:10.975
I ask you God to put a
special hand of a blessing

40:10.976 --> 40:12.476
on this family.

40:12.477 --> 40:14.545
Give them comfort today, God.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.515
Give them freedom today, God.

40:17.516 --> 40:21.185
Give them the joy of knowing
that you have your hands around

40:21.186 --> 40:25.156
them dear Father, and that
you will not let them sink

40:25.157 --> 40:27.090
into despair.

40:27.793 --> 40:31.095
Today, God, we rejoice because
we will see a miracle.

40:31.096 --> 40:35.833
Today we rejoice because you
will manifest yourself as God.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.836
I thank you God for
leading me here.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.105
I thank you for this family.

40:41.106 --> 40:45.708
I thank you for faith, but most
of all, I thank you for you.

40:46.645 --> 40:50.014
In the name of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ,

40:50.015 --> 40:53.451
I receive it,
and I rejoice in it.

40:53.452 --> 40:54.819
Amen.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.586
And amen.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.090
Thanks.

41:04.529 --> 41:06.864
STEVE: Okay, well, thank
you for another great meal,

41:06.865 --> 41:07.832
Mrs. Nichols.

41:07.833 --> 41:08.799
You're welcome.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.869
And I'll see you for a
tutoring session at the

41:11.870 --> 41:12.969
library on Thursday.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.072
Sir?

41:15.073 --> 41:17.741
Yeah. Hey, thanks for
doing the dishes again, Steve.

41:17.742 --> 41:18.776
I appreciate it.

41:18.777 --> 41:19.844
Pleasure.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.045
You know, while
you're still here,

41:21.046 --> 41:22.713
I could use some
help out in the garage.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.482
No, he can't.

41:24.483 --> 41:26.116
JIM: I could use a pair
of second, strong hands.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.853
Being in the military like I am,
we tend to move around a lot,

41:28.854 --> 41:30.554
and basically I just throw
everything in my truck and dump

41:30.555 --> 41:31.789
it in the garage.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.557
I could use some
help sorting it out.

41:33.558 --> 41:35.693
MARION: Jim.
He's not your employee.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.963
I'm sure Steve has his
own life to get back to.

41:38.964 --> 41:42.032
I'm sure he does, but two
of us working together,

41:42.033 --> 41:44.168
get it done in
less than an hour.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.503
Besides, I don't think
Steve minds, do you Steve?

41:47.672 --> 41:50.206
Okay. Sure.
Yeah, of course, no problem.

41:50.976 --> 41:51.775
Yeah.

41:51.776 --> 41:52.809
I'll meet you out there.

41:53.512 --> 41:54.512
Sure.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.884
Don't you have
some homework to do?

42:17.002 --> 42:18.936
JIM: My wife's the
sentimental type.

42:18.937 --> 42:20.804
She likes to keep things.

42:20.805 --> 42:23.007
This is all the stuff she's
kept over all our moves.

42:23.008 --> 42:25.109
Looks like we've been
here for 30 years.

42:25.110 --> 42:26.777
Fact is, it's only
been a couple.

42:26.778 --> 42:29.547
Yeah, I'd like to see
the garage floor again.

42:29.548 --> 42:32.683
Far as I'm concerned,
you can junk all of this.

42:32.684 --> 42:36.020
I'll get you some trash bags,
you can put it all together,

42:36.021 --> 42:38.789
take it out front, and I'll haul
it off to the dump in my truck.

42:38.790 --> 42:41.091
This is a lot of stuff.

42:41.092 --> 42:42.859
Well you're a strong boy.

42:43.628 --> 42:45.161
You got some place
you need to be?

42:47.566 --> 42:50.233
Uhm-I have an
early morning class.

42:51.770 --> 42:52.836
Oh.

42:52.837 --> 42:54.737
Well, then you better get to it.

42:55.140 --> 42:56.839
Mr. Smartypants.

43:22.167 --> 43:24.300
You have roll call at 06:00.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.237
I know that.

43:27.238 --> 43:29.740
Just leave.
You don't owe him anything.

43:29.741 --> 43:31.208
He's testing me.

43:31.209 --> 43:33.776
He's crazy, you don't
have to put up with this.

43:34.245 --> 43:35.946
You're worth it.

43:35.947 --> 43:38.181
Please, go home.

43:38.984 --> 43:40.283
I'm not done yet.

43:40.819 --> 43:41.986
JIM: Hey!

43:41.987 --> 43:43.821
You're not properly
dressed, young lady!

43:43.822 --> 43:46.790
And you, you better
pick up the pace.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.691
Sun's gonna be up soon!

43:55.300 --> 43:56.967
You wanna help him?

43:56.968 --> 43:58.936
You put on some proper clothes.

43:58.937 --> 44:02.939
[music playing]

44:11.282 --> 44:13.817
I know he's just
trying to break me.

44:13.818 --> 44:17.855
Ephesians tells us, "Husbands
should love their wives as

44:17.856 --> 44:20.724
Christ loved the Church and
gave himself up for her."

44:20.725 --> 44:22.359
So what, I
should just take it?

44:22.360 --> 44:23.427
Whatever he throws at me?

44:23.428 --> 44:25.095
Yes.

44:25.096 --> 44:28.164
It'll be painful, you'll
wanna scream at him.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.867
To stand up for yourself.

44:31.369 --> 44:33.871
But if you take it,
eventually you will overcome.

44:33.872 --> 44:35.672
He's just trying to
test you to make sure your

44:38.443 --> 44:39.559
intentions are pure.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.760
What do you think would happen
if you lashed out at him?

44:43.715 --> 44:45.448
I'd be proving him right?

44:46.217 --> 44:48.017
Exactly.

44:48.453 --> 44:51.088
STEVE: Okay, it's a six.
But this is a Y, it's an N,

44:51.089 --> 44:55.191
close bracket, plus open bracket
Y, plus three, equals what?

44:55.727 --> 44:56.894
Four.

44:56.895 --> 44:58.762
STEVE: No, you
actually wrote three.

44:58.763 --> 44:59.862
Negative four.

45:00.699 --> 45:03.266
It's a great try,
but it's wrong.

45:04.402 --> 45:05.703
I don't think it's wrong.

45:05.704 --> 45:07.270
It's wrong.
I don't think so.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.007
So here,
ten questions right.

45:11.810 --> 45:12.810
[laughs]

45:12.811 --> 45:13.876
You got them.

45:14.245 --> 45:15.411
Steve.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.114
Great, you're here.

45:17.115 --> 45:18.981
Nice to see you, sir.

45:19.317 --> 45:21.251
I got a serious weed
problem out in the garden,

45:21.252 --> 45:22.418
wanna give me a hand?

45:23.121 --> 45:24.888
STEVE: Weeds?

45:24.889 --> 45:27.056
JIM: Out of control,
like they do.

45:30.261 --> 45:31.394
Sure.

45:58.156 --> 45:59.389
Can I get some water?

45:59.390 --> 46:01.357
You're almost done,
just push on through.

46:06.898 --> 46:07.898
Argh!

46:08.933 --> 46:10.868
I think these gloves
have holes in them.

46:10.869 --> 46:12.836
It's the only ones we have.

46:12.837 --> 46:15.539
I- I-actually,
there are some in the garage.

46:15.540 --> 46:17.173
No, I got rid of those.

46:24.315 --> 46:25.381
Aargh!!

46:25.984 --> 46:26.984
All right.

46:28.887 --> 46:31.354
That's gonna hurt a whole
lot worse without them.

46:32.157 --> 46:34.057
What do I have to do?

46:34.058 --> 46:35.459
I don't know, what can you do?

46:35.460 --> 46:36.993
What is your
problem with me?

46:37.829 --> 46:39.929
I don't know, I just
don't trust you.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.267
Something not right about you.

46:43.268 --> 46:44.935
I don't even
know what I've done.

46:44.936 --> 46:46.970
You don't think I see the way
you two look at each other?

46:46.971 --> 46:48.405
And would
that be so bad?

46:48.406 --> 46:50.107
Must be, or you two
wouldn't keep telling me

46:50.108 --> 46:52.074
that you're just friends.

46:54.279 --> 46:55.845
I'm not one
of your recruits.

46:57.415 --> 46:59.583
I knew what you were
the moment I saw you.

46:59.584 --> 47:00.584
And what's that?

47:00.585 --> 47:01.851
Soft.

47:02.854 --> 47:03.953
MARION: What's going on?

47:05.590 --> 47:07.256
Oh, nothing.

47:07.892 --> 47:09.926
Me and Steve were just
joking around, huh?

47:16.234 --> 47:17.500
You okay?

47:37.355 --> 47:39.223
I can't believe him.

47:39.224 --> 47:41.525
I shouldn't of lost
it at him like that.

47:41.526 --> 47:44.528
Pastor Roberts was right, I
gave him exactly what he wanted.

47:44.529 --> 47:45.995
This isn't your fault.

47:47.098 --> 47:48.865
He knows something's up.

47:49.234 --> 47:52.603
We'll tell him eventually,
when he comes around to it.

47:52.604 --> 47:56.039
I'm in the Air Police,
he's a Chief Master Sargent.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.574
We work on the same base,

47:57.575 --> 47:59.376
we're just lucky
he hasn't seen me yet.

47:59.377 --> 48:01.378
But he's never here,
he's always off on temp duty

48:01.379 --> 48:04.014
at some other base.
He's got another trip coming up.

48:04.015 --> 48:05.581
We're fine.

48:10.154 --> 48:11.454
I don't know.

48:17.929 --> 48:20.063
Just cover for me on guard duty.

48:20.064 --> 48:21.431
ROBBIE: I covered
for you last time,

48:21.432 --> 48:23.100
the watch commander caught me.

48:23.101 --> 48:25.968
I spent hours,
hours cleaning toilets.

48:26.671 --> 48:28.631
You know I can't pee in a
public bathroom anymore?

48:29.340 --> 48:32.109
You know how long it
takes to scrub a toilet

48:32.110 --> 48:33.210
with a toothbrush?

48:33.211 --> 48:35.646
You know how long it
takes to scrub fifteen?

48:35.647 --> 48:37.381
Fifteen of them.

48:37.382 --> 48:39.622
Yeah, because I did it when
I covered for you with Julie.

48:40.285 --> 48:41.952
You mean my wife?

48:41.953 --> 48:43.519
You haven't proposed yet.

48:44.222 --> 48:47.023
Not yet, but I might do, maybe.

48:47.659 --> 48:48.959
Maybe not.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.426
She keeps me on my toes.

48:51.129 --> 48:52.262
And she's cute.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.329
Are you done yet?

48:54.065 --> 48:55.231
Maybe.

48:56.267 --> 48:57.667
Maybe not.

48:59.203 --> 49:00.570
You owe me.

49:00.571 --> 49:01.939
I don't owe you.

49:01.940 --> 49:03.572
I paid you back, we're square.

49:05.176 --> 49:06.976
Look, they haven't
seen this guy in weeks.

49:07.278 --> 49:08.711
Or the-

49:13.618 --> 49:14.717
JIM: At ease.

49:17.288 --> 49:18.487
Whoops.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.592
Your friend here-

49:24.729 --> 49:26.128
liar.

49:36.307 --> 49:37.506
Are you okay?

49:39.644 --> 49:41.644
I won't be soon.

49:47.986 --> 49:49.452
JIM: Marion?

49:49.654 --> 49:51.387
Jan?
Jan?

49:53.224 --> 49:55.292
You know that young man
who comes into our house,

49:55.293 --> 49:57.094
eats our food, your friend.

49:57.095 --> 49:58.762
The one you insulted?

49:58.763 --> 50:01.031
Didn't think I knew
about that, did you?

50:01.032 --> 50:04.101
I should've done worse
considering the-student

50:04.102 --> 50:06.602
just waved me through
the gate on base.

50:07.705 --> 50:08.739
Well?

50:08.740 --> 50:10.640
I wasn't lying.

50:10.641 --> 50:14.344
He is a student, he's just
also in the Air Force.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.580
You don't think that was
important for me to know?

50:16.581 --> 50:18.548
I knew that you wouldn't
like it, and I like him,

50:18.549 --> 50:20.050
so I didn't tell you.

50:20.051 --> 50:21.584
You're dating a GI?

50:22.487 --> 50:24.020
I guess I am.

50:26.457 --> 50:27.758
Not anymore you're not.

50:27.759 --> 50:30.093
You can't stop me
from seeing him.

50:30.094 --> 50:31.595
What? You don't
think I can find a way to get

50:31.596 --> 50:33.330
him dishonorably discharged?

50:33.331 --> 50:35.432
I got a half a dozen officers
on that base who would find a

50:35.433 --> 50:36.733
reason for me in a heartbeat.

50:36.734 --> 50:38.068
You wouldn't do that.

50:38.069 --> 50:38.668
Of course I would.

50:38.669 --> 50:40.237
No, he's a good man.

50:40.238 --> 50:42.072
He's a liar.

50:42.073 --> 50:47.277
He came in to my house and lied
to my face night after night.

50:47.278 --> 50:48.711
I asked him to.

50:49.714 --> 50:52.549
Sweetheart, he's not
good enough for you.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.583
Well shouldn't I
get to decide that?

50:55.586 --> 50:57.653
This is for the best.

50:58.656 --> 50:59.556
No.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.123
No!

51:01.659 --> 51:02.826
That's it.

51:02.827 --> 51:04.561
It's done.

51:04.562 --> 51:07.430
[music playing]

51:12.203 --> 51:13.803
I'll talk to him.

51:23.448 --> 51:25.081
Sweetheart.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.617
Steve, blink if you can hear me.

51:33.658 --> 51:35.724
Give us a little blink, dad.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.526
Please.

51:42.800 --> 51:48.437
[music playing]

52:00.384 --> 52:01.784
Are we being punished?

52:04.422 --> 52:05.488
No.

52:08.292 --> 52:09.525
Hey mom,

52:11.762 --> 52:13.562
I know you
don't wanna move dad.

52:14.599 --> 52:15.698
Okay?

52:17.435 --> 52:21.670
But I do think we probably have
some decisions to make though.

52:22.707 --> 52:24.607
What should we do?

52:25.510 --> 52:30.147
I talked to the staff here
and they have an end-of-life

52:30.148 --> 52:36.519
physician, and maybe just
tomorrow we go talk to him,

52:37.688 --> 52:39.855
figure out what our options are.

52:41.392 --> 52:44.326
TERRI: Can we just
hold on a little longer?

52:45.196 --> 52:46.695
It's just to get information.

52:47.331 --> 52:49.498
Okay?
That's all it is.

52:50.268 --> 52:51.734
I understand.

52:55.439 --> 52:57.641
DR. RUSSO: Your daughter
has brought me up to speed

52:57.642 --> 53:00.293
on your situation,

53:00.294 --> 53:02.946
and obviously there's no problem
leaving Steve right where he is.

53:02.947 --> 53:05.581
Our trauma center staff can
handle everything you need.

53:05.917 --> 53:07.383
Thank you.

53:08.586 --> 53:10.387
I have a question.

53:10.388 --> 53:12.522
Absolutely, that's
what I'm here for.

53:12.523 --> 53:16.959
Everyone keeps telling
me that there's no hope.

53:17.695 --> 53:18.762
Why?

53:18.763 --> 53:23.299
I am useless to you if I
don't tell you the truth.

53:23.901 --> 53:27.437
The reason that everyone is
telling you there's no hope

53:27.438 --> 53:29.705
is because there is none.

53:30.942 --> 53:32.976
Steve's lungs started to
collapse before he arrived at

53:32.977 --> 53:34.543
the hospital.

53:35.379 --> 53:38.747
Along with that and the
paralysis as one thing,

53:39.684 --> 53:42.352
there's just too many
things to deal with.

53:42.353 --> 53:45.722
But people just don't die
because they're paralyzed.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.591
It's more than that.

53:47.592 --> 53:49.326
DR. RUSSO: You're right.

53:49.327 --> 53:52.662
In Steve's case, if he recovered
the ability to breathe on his

53:52.663 --> 53:57.234
own, or if his heart could beat
without the extreme medical

53:57.235 --> 54:02.272
interventions he's currently on,
then yes he would have some sort

54:02.273 --> 54:06.476
of opportunity for a functional
life outside of the hospital

54:06.477 --> 54:08.245
as a quadriplegic.

54:08.246 --> 54:09.613
Okay.

54:09.614 --> 54:12.249
Some people in these
situations have recovered.

54:12.250 --> 54:14.017
We researched it.

54:14.018 --> 54:16.419
I understand.

54:16.420 --> 54:18.822
But, if that were going to
happen we would've seen some

54:18.823 --> 54:21.023
sign of it by now.

54:22.526 --> 54:24.394
Your accident was
Friday morning?

54:24.395 --> 54:25.996
Mm-hmm.

54:25.997 --> 54:28.665
DR. RUSSO: By Sunday evening
Steve's heart still showed no

54:28.666 --> 54:31.600
ability to
tolerate reduced drugs.

54:32.570 --> 54:37.406
His lungs clearly still showed
no ability to work on their own.

54:38.776 --> 54:43.980
And since then, every test
consistently shows that he's not

54:43.981 --> 54:47.316
only not improving,
he's getting worse.

54:49.320 --> 54:53.622
Today is Tuesday, soon he won't
be responsive in any way.

54:55.926 --> 54:59.929
I'm sure we can prolong
his life artificially but

54:59.930 --> 55:01.930
would he want that?

55:03.501 --> 55:05.734
I can't answer that for you.

55:06.771 --> 55:10.306
You have to decide that
together as a family.

55:12.410 --> 55:14.711
I have prayed and prayed.

55:14.712 --> 55:17.012
How does God decide
when to make a miracle?

55:19.317 --> 55:20.883
And why your dad?

55:21.786 --> 55:23.320
We've had faith.

55:23.321 --> 55:26.088
Mom, it's in His hands.

55:27.558 --> 55:31.527
We don't know when
God does what he does.

55:32.897 --> 55:34.963
But we have to keep our faith.

55:36.434 --> 55:38.801
I don't think that's
possible for me right now.

55:39.403 --> 55:43.772
Bad things happen to
good people all the time.

55:46.510 --> 55:48.677
Mom, we have got
to keep believing.

55:49.880 --> 55:51.980
Do you think he knows?

55:54.051 --> 55:55.585
What?

55:55.586 --> 55:57.086
That's he's dying?

56:00.758 --> 56:03.827
JAN: He was always the careful
one, he was always careful.

56:03.828 --> 56:05.895
I am the one who
should not be here.

56:05.896 --> 56:07.364
MICHELE: Hey.

56:07.365 --> 56:10.132
Mom hey, you cannot feel
guilty for surviving.

56:11.402 --> 56:13.702
If I could trade places
with him I would.

56:16.640 --> 56:21.643
[music playing]

56:28.052 --> 56:31.420
[upbeat music]

57:03.954 --> 57:06.155
STEVE: Your dad's
gonna go nuclear.

57:06.590 --> 57:09.559
That won't change
if we go back now.

57:09.560 --> 57:10.960
Something's happened.

57:10.961 --> 57:12.161
What?

57:13.063 --> 57:14.630
They're transferring me.

57:15.766 --> 57:16.999
To where?

57:17.701 --> 57:19.669
Omaha, Nebraska.

57:19.670 --> 57:21.004
Nebraska?

57:21.005 --> 57:22.705
Why?

57:22.706 --> 57:26.041
I'll be part of the Elite
Guard at Strategic Air Command.

57:28.045 --> 57:29.645
I'll be guarding generals.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.483
I'm proud of you.

57:33.484 --> 57:34.817
Thanks.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.925
But what does it mean for us?

57:43.694 --> 57:46.028
I might be gone
for a long time.

57:46.630 --> 57:48.198
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

57:48.199 --> 57:50.098
Are you really gonna
do this right now?

57:51.502 --> 57:52.836
How did you know?

57:52.837 --> 57:54.771
I'm not stupid, Steve.

57:54.772 --> 57:56.573
Well then, do you want to?

57:56.574 --> 57:57.807
No.

57:57.808 --> 57:59.876
But I'll be gone,
don't you think we should?

57:59.877 --> 58:01.845
Why, I love you.

58:01.846 --> 58:03.713
Yes that's exactly why.

58:03.714 --> 58:05.548
You want to break up
with me because I love you?

58:05.549 --> 58:06.716
Break up?

58:06.717 --> 58:08.251
[laughs]

58:08.252 --> 58:10.819
No, no, hey-

58:13.724 --> 58:15.491
I want to marry you.

58:17.094 --> 58:18.495
What?

58:18.496 --> 58:20.128
Before I get transferred.

58:24.802 --> 58:29.171
Don't people usually get a ring
in these kind of situation?

58:31.909 --> 58:34.277
You know-I-

58:34.278 --> 58:40.148
I make like $250 a month, I
can't afford what you deserve.

58:42.620 --> 58:45.889
That's okay, you'd probably
pick the wrong one anyway,

58:45.890 --> 58:47.856
I can pick my own.

58:49.093 --> 58:50.759
I've been saving up from work.

58:54.231 --> 58:57.266
That's why I want
to marry you, you know.

59:00.070 --> 59:01.970
Don't get used to it.

59:03.173 --> 59:04.740
What?

59:05.643 --> 59:07.076
What?

59:07.077 --> 59:09.879
My dad always said that
if he caught me dating a GI

59:09.880 --> 59:12.015
he'd ship me off to Nebraska.

59:12.016 --> 59:13.682
[laughter]

59:14.885 --> 59:17.553
I want you to get my
father's blessing.

59:18.055 --> 59:20.789
I know what he's been like,
but he's still my dad.

59:24.161 --> 59:26.795
What if he
doesn't give it to me?

59:28.198 --> 59:30.767
I don't see how we can
be married if he doesn't.

59:30.768 --> 59:32.301
He'll always be my father.

59:33.070 --> 59:34.804
I don't want us to
spend the rest of our

59:34.805 --> 59:36.039
lives sneaking around.

59:36.040 --> 59:38.840
So you won't
marry me if he doesn't?

59:40.744 --> 59:42.645
It's important to me.

59:42.646 --> 59:44.112
Okay.

59:45.683 --> 59:48.183
I'll do whatever I
have to do to get it.

59:51.221 --> 59:52.321
I love you.

59:53.190 --> 59:55.023
I love you too.

[car honks horn]

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:06.269
You think that's...

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.670
That's definitely him.

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:11.841
Get over here, young lady.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:14.843
I'll deal with him, but you
have to talk to him some time.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.382
You'd tell me if
he murdered one of your

01:00:19.383 --> 01:00:21.083
ex-boyfriends, right?

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:23.785
Right?

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.723
Right?

01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:29.691
JIM: Let's go.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.662
I will not forget this.

Liar who takes my
daughter to make out in

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:00.656
the middle of the night.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:02.358
[clears throat]

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:05.127
There is something
I want to ask you.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:09.931
Well I'm going to do a
little target practice later on,

01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:13.101
we can talk then.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:14.903
Okay.

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:33.690
JIM: So tell me something
Steve, you a shooter?

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:34.691
STEVE: Yes sir.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:35.692
You any good?

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:36.993
I'm okay.

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:39.328

come on let's go.

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:40.362
This way.

01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:49.371
Shouldn't
you lead the way?

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:53.109
You're doing just fine,
it's about 100 yards up here.

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.376
We'll be good.

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:05.487
Keep going?

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:08.190
50 yards.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:10.726
[gun shot]

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:12.462
Good shot, chief.

[gun shot]

01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:25.007
You sure you qualified
on the range?

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:26.375
I did.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:27.943
You say so.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:33.449

move back here about 30 feet,

01:02:47.498 --> 01:02:49.832
Are you insane?

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:52.168
Oh man calm down I could
shoot a pimple off your face.

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:54.002
STEVE: You're crazy.

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:55.838

Steve, you're fine.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:03:00.523

blessing to marry your daughter.

Oh.
Is that right?

Yes sir.

You see that brown bottle

back there,
that's about 15 metres away.

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:13.422
That's far less than you
need to qualify on the range.

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:16.559
I'm going to give you two shots.
You hit one of them,

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.795
you'll have my blessing
to marry my daughter.

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:22.330
You're on.

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:24.967
Why do you want
to marry her now anyway?

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.035
What's the hurry?

[gun shot]

01:03:40.851 --> 01:03:44.253
Steve, it's a lot easier to fall
in love with a girl that you can

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:48.257
see, but you're going to be on
a new base and your air force

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:51.027
buddies, they're going to be
telling you that she's already

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:52.962
forgotten about you and you're
going to be sitting there

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:54.530
waiting for your
Dear John letter.

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.399
It won't be
like that for us.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.368
You're going to be out on leave,
out in the world socializing.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:01.436
There's going to be all
sorts of other women.

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.506
Women that you can see and you
can smell that are a lot more

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:05.474
real than anything you can write
down on a piece of paper or

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:07.243
what's in a photograph.

01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:08.244
That's not true.

01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:10.879
You're still human, Steve.

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:15.383
Everything you're about to do
is to push you away from her.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.621
The only thing pushing
me away from your daughter

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:21.022
is you, Mr. Nichols.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:25.260
But guess what, I qualified
as an expert marksman too.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:27.430
Go on.

Yeah well that was close.

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:52.654

[music playing]

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.472
If you're ready to leave-

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:14.910
I need you to say goodbye.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:20.148
They think I
should let you go,

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:24.319
but it still feels wrong.

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:28.990
I need you to tell
me what to do.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:36.498
Please, please
tell me what to do.

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:39.401
Please.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:57.185
Okay.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.223
Okay.

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:06.294
I love you.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.707
Your dad told me what he wants.

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:26.114
How?

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.552
We've been together 46 years.

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:37.025
I asked and God let
him tell me in his way.

01:06:39.596 --> 01:06:41.463
What did he say?

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:44.199
He's ready to go.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.742
If God's up there he's ready
to welcome Dad in to Heaven.

01:06:57.414 --> 01:06:59.247
Look at you.

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:03.485
I said if.

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:06.221
He is-

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:10.759
and he will.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.629
You think Pastor Roberts
is still in town?

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.467
Another half hour and
I'd have been on my flight.

01:07:21.772 --> 01:07:23.538
I didn't think I
would see you again.

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:26.508
You're no more
surprised than me.

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:36.151
[sniffles]

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:40.922
How does it happen?

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:42.358
Without medication his heart
rate will drop to critical

01:07:42.359 --> 01:07:45.594
levels, and he won't
be able to breathe.

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.196
Will he be in pain?

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:49.331
No, he'll be sedated.

01:07:49.332 --> 01:07:51.300
He'll be comfortable.

01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:55.603
And then he'll pass peacefully
when we turn off support.

01:07:57.441 --> 01:08:00.275
Is there a time you prefer?

01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:07.615
You-you want me to choose
what time my husband dies?

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.152
Yes.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:15.191
I'd suggest 11 a.m.

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:18.760
It's between visiting
hours and it'll be quiet.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.729
Can they stay with him?

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.798
Absolutely.

01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:24.866
You can stay as
long as you need.

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:29.872
Heavenly Father,
we come to you at a time

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:33.241
of sadness,
asking you for peace.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:40.416
Almighty God, we are here today
because Steve is ready to depart

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:45.220
this world and we ask you, oh
Lord that you allow him to pass

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:47.421
as he desired to live.

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:52.827
In your church, in your
faith, and in your love.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.832
We ask you oh Lord that
you take him into eternity

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.666
to go home with you.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:03.371
Can I say something?

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.875
Of course.

01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:15.350
MICHELE: God, my dad
devoted his entire life to you.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.354
So I just ask that you
please take care of him

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:23.925
on the other side.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.662
Will you please tell him
that he will always be-

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:31.499
so loved-

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:35.502
and remembered.

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:44.546
[sobbing]

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:46.214
And that we love him.

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:50.219
And that he's in Jesus' hands.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.787
Lord we-

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:54.422
we let him go in
to your hands now.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:57.892
[sobbing]

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:01.196
In Jesus' name,

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:05.434
amen.

01:10:05.969 --> 01:10:07.603
PASTOR ROBERTS: And amen.

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:09.054
[music playing]

01:10:09.055 --> 01:10:10.506
STEVE: No that's it then.

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:12.575
We're never getting married.

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:15.511
You can try again, he'll
warm up to you eventually.

01:10:15.512 --> 01:10:17.780
No he won't,
okay you weren't there.

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:19.515
You didn't see his face.

01:10:19.516 --> 01:10:21.683
And we don't have
time for eventually.

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:25.521
We-we just,
we can't give up.

01:10:25.522 --> 01:10:28.957
He'll never accept
me, okay you're right.

01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:31.627
It's not going to be any kind
of life if we're sneaking

01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:34.930
around forever, Okay?
That's your family.

01:10:34.931 --> 01:10:36.765
I'm not going to come
between him and you.

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:38.000
Well you shouldn't have to.

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:39.567
You're not listening to me.

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:41.402
Hey!

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:43.972
I'm saying I won't.

01:10:46.376 --> 01:10:47.942
You're saying that this is over?

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:50.478
It has to be.

01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:56.384
[knocks on door]

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:03.491
Now we couldn't have discussed
this in the morning?

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:06.528
I'm sorry, I just
didn't know where to go,

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:08.496
and Steve's going to
get transferred soon.

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:10.398
It's alright.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:17.739
Love is patient and kind,
it does not envy or boast.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.310
It is not arrogant or rude.

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:25.647
It does not insist
on its own way.

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.717
It is not irritable

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:35.824
and it never
rejoices at wrongdoing.

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:38.559
It rejoices with truth.

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:41.529
That's Corinthians.

01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:43.531
[sniffles]

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:47.903
That's Steve, he's taken
everything my dad's thrown at

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:50.471
him and he's done it with
patience and kindness.

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:58.447
Imagine that Steve did leave
and never returned and you never

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:02.718
got back together, imagine
yourself two years from now.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:03.851
What do you see?

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:06.554
Nothing.

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:10.425
How does that make you
feel to think about it?

01:12:12.796 --> 01:12:15.763
Like trying to imagine
walking on the moon.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:20.802
Alright.

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:22.970
Well?

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:26.709
You know what you have to do.

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:29.078
Now let me get some sleep,
I still have to conduct

01:12:29.079 --> 01:12:30.646
morning services.

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:32.648
But I don't know what to
do, that's why I came here.

01:12:32.649 --> 01:12:34.982
I... tell me what to do?

01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:36.851
You need to me say it for you?

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:41.723
You obviously love him,
if you want him,

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:44.359
then go fight for him.

01:13:04.414 --> 01:13:05.480
[exhales]

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:09.450
I love him.

01:13:10.453 --> 01:13:12.721
You're still a teenager,
you think you love him.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.689
Once he's gone,
you'll forget about him.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:17.058
I will never forget him.

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:21.796
Jan, I've said my piece.

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:24.533
You can't do this.

01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:25.800
Oh yeah? Try me!

01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:27.903
You can't do this.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:30.506
Dad, you can't...

01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:32.841
This conversation
is over, young lady.

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:34.643
It will never be over.

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:37.078
He left me, he's gone.

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:40.182
Because of you, you won.

01:13:40.183 --> 01:13:41.817
Does that make you happy?

01:13:41.818 --> 01:13:42.985
Does that bring you joy?

01:13:42.986 --> 01:13:46.554
I hope so, I hope so.

01:13:47.157 --> 01:13:50.993
I hope so because you
did lose one thing.

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:52.994
Do you know what that is?

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:55.696
You lost me.

01:13:57.066 --> 01:14:01.169
I will never forgive you,
I'm never going to forget this,

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:03.605
ever.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:06.608
Well then there's no point in
talking about this anymore,

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:07.775
is there?

01:14:08.578 --> 01:14:09.677
We're done.

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:39.640
You're just like him, you know.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:42.910
That why you're so scared?

01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:48.583
We were younger than they
are when we got married.

01:14:49.886 --> 01:14:52.753
You think my friends didn't
try to warn me about you?

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:56.124
You think they didn't
say exactly what you're

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:57.792
saying about Steve?

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:03.732
But I didn't judge
you on what other people

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:05.500
thought you might be.

01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:08.769
I judged you on your actions.

01:15:09.873 --> 01:15:11.072
He lied to us.

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:14.208
Because he was afraid.

01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:16.979
You do know that they've
been seeing each other

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.146
behind our backs?

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:20.214
You hear her creeping
out late at night.

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.685
Is that how you want our
future son-in-law to behave?

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:25.720
What other choice
did you give them?

01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:28.856
Well he's transferring.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:33.595
And if he wasn't serious about
our daughter it would be a

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:36.598
perfect opportunity
for him to end it.

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:37.865
It is.

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:49.243
You remember when I was nine
months pregnant with Jan

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:53.581
and we thought I would go
in to labor at any moment?

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.954
You would do this all night.

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:03.324
I have a meeting with
General Robinson tomorrow.

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:12.333
Your shoes are clean, honey,

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:14.702
it's your conscience
that isn't.

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:25.948
You're right.

01:16:25.949 --> 01:16:27.115
I am.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.683
Yes you are.

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:32.186
I need to make the
choice for them.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:36.691
[sigh]

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:43.998
What are you going to do?

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.634
STEVE: What can I do?

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:47.268
I don't have a choice.

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:50.338
It's over.

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:53.774
Might want to take a walk.

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:03.084
What do you want?

01:17:03.753 --> 01:17:05.786
You'll address me as Chief, son.

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:08.824
Okay, what do
you want-Chief?

01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:10.926
I can have you written
up for insubordination.

01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:12.060
Yes sir,
if that's all sir.

01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:13.227
I have nothing to say to you.

01:17:15.031 --> 01:17:17.132
I just have one
question for you.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.834
What's that?

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:20.135
Why are you in the service?

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:21.969
I am here to
serve my country, sir.

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:23.838
No, no.

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:27.643
I want to know what
it means to you.

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:30.745
What does it mean to you
to be in the military?

01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:32.713
[breaking voice]
Everything.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:36.851
It hasn't just
given my life purpose-

01:17:39.055 --> 01:17:40.921
it's given me a family.

01:17:53.403 --> 01:17:56.371
I've never seen
anything like this happen,

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:58.739
this bottle should
have broke but it didn't.

01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:04.445
It got me thinking, maybe
God is leaving this to me.

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:07.816
Now, I didn't have
to tell you about that,

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:09.818
but I would have always known.

01:18:09.819 --> 01:18:11.118
And I'm a man of my word.

01:18:13.756 --> 01:18:16.091
So I think you're going
to marry my daughter,

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:18.926
unless you've changed
your mind of course.

01:18:21.431 --> 01:18:22.831
Are you serious?

01:18:22.832 --> 01:18:24.099
Yes sir.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.267
Thank you.

01:18:25.268 --> 01:18:27.369
Hey, hey, hey show some dignity.

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:29.337
You're still on duty.

01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:30.472
Sorry sir.

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:32.239
As you were.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:36.945
Now it's my understanding that
you don't have a lot of time to

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:39.147
marry her before you
transfer, is that right?

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:40.414
Mm-hmm.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:44.485
Well then, we better get to it.

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:50.792
God bless you, son.

01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:53.928
[music playing]

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:12.813
[door opens]

01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:23.191
You, somebody
could have told me.

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:26.761
[music playing]

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:37.239
PASTOR ROBERTS:
Repeat after me, I Steve Hearst.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.040
I Steve Hearst.

01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:40.274
Take you Jan Nichols.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:42.210
STEVE: Take you Jan Nichols.

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:43.178
PASTOR ROBERTS: To be my wife.

01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:44.545
STEVE: To be my wife.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.819
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.088
To have and to
hold from this day forward.

01:19:53.089 --> 01:19:55.524
PASTOR ROBERTS: For better, for
worse, for richer, for poorer.

01:19:55.525 --> 01:19:57.793
In sickness and in health.

01:19:57.794 --> 01:20:00.428
For better or worse,
for richer or poorer,

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:02.797
in sickness and health.

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:04.625
PASTOR ROBERTS: To love and to cherish.

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:06.401
STEVE: To love and to cherish.

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:08.270
PASTOR ROBERTS:
Until we are parted by death.

01:20:08.271 --> 01:20:10.171
STEVE: Until we
are parted by death.

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:11.940
PASTOR ROBERTS: Repeat after me, Jan.

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:13.475
I Jan Nichols.

01:20:13.476 --> 01:20:15.443
I, Jan Nichols.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:16.978
Take you Steve Hearst.

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:18.947
Take you, Steve Hearst.

01:20:18.948 --> 01:20:19.981
PASTOR ROBERTS: To be my husband.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.817
JAN: To be my husband.

01:20:21.818 --> 01:20:23.985
PASTOR ROBERTS: To have and
to hold from this day forward.

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:26.988
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:29.858
PASTOR ROBERTS: For better, for
worse, for richer, for poorer.

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:31.960
In sickness and in health.

01:20:31.961 --> 01:20:35.297
JAN: For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer.

01:20:35.298 --> 01:20:37.566

You may kiss the bride.

Woo!

01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:16.204

01:21:42.932 --> 01:21:44.532
What's happening?

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:47.067
I don't know, doctor,
he's still breathing.

01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:50.205
DOCTOR: This is not unusual,

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:52.139
he still has
some air in his lungs.

01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:55.342
He can't really breathe
without the machine.

01:21:56.112 --> 01:21:57.945
He'll stop soon.

01:21:58.948 --> 01:22:00.948
He wants to stay a
little longer with you.

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:06.054
I love you.

01:22:06.055 --> 01:22:08.256
[sobbing]

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:10.224
It's okay to go.

01:22:12.295 --> 01:22:13.961
He's with God now.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:17.431
Okay.

Are you okay, mom?

01:23:04.513 --> 01:23:06.413
