CHRIS ROCK:
In all the years of school,

00:04.705 --> 00:07.041
there was nothing I loved
better than summer vacation,

00:07.075 --> 00:09.143
and the next best thing
was spring break.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.312
Free at last!
Free at last!

00:11.345 --> 00:13.314
Thank God Almighty,
we're free at last!

00:13.347 --> 00:15.216
Greg?

00:15.249 --> 00:16.750
It's spring break,
not the end of racism.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.053
Well, I'm celebrating now,
'cause once I get up

00:19.087 --> 00:20.721
to Lake Winnipesaukee
with my mom and dad,

00:20.754 --> 00:22.290
it's not going to be good.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.491
I thought your
parents split up.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.658
They did, but neither one

00:24.692 --> 00:25.793
will give up the time share,

00:25.826 --> 00:27.795
so I taking the bus
to meet them

00:27.828 --> 00:29.663
for a weekend of fishing
and drinking and fighting.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.765
Don't forget crying.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.700
See you next week.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.835
* Free falling,
now I'm free falling... *

00:34.868 --> 00:36.504
Hey, want to grab a bite?

00:36.537 --> 00:37.605
Nah, I got to get home.

00:37.638 --> 00:38.506
We're supposed to be headed out
to Amityville Beach.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.641
My dad wants
to be on the road by 4:00.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.810
Well, that sounds nice.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.412
Hey, you're that black kid.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.414
Hey, you're that white janitor.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.282
Except for the fact
that I hate the beach.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.750
Last time I was there,
I got sun rash.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.320
(man singing in Italian
on car stereo)

00:52.353 --> 00:54.388
Man, cool ride.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.856
Thanks.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.758
It's my cousin's.

00:57.791 --> 01:02.396
350 cubic inch engine,
240 horsepower, huh?

01:02.430 --> 01:04.432
What I have to do
to get a car like this?

01:04.465 --> 01:06.334
Steal it.
Want to take it for a spin?

01:06.367 --> 01:08.269
You serious?
Sure.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.104
Five bucks.

01:10.138 --> 01:13.707
He was like the Don "Magic"
Juan of Camaros.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.345
Now, it's a stick shift.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.512
Make sure you keep
the clutch in.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.681
Right

01:26.220 --> 01:27.621
White man down!
White man down!

01:27.655 --> 01:29.390
Oh, man.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.858
Greg, you okay?

01:30.891 --> 01:32.126
Who taught you
how to drive?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.794
Halle Berry.

01:34.795 --> 01:38.399
Okay, let's get
him in the trunk.
What?!

01:38.432 --> 01:40.301
Look, I got a rap sheet
as long as your arm.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.203
My PO thinks
that I hit this kid,

01:42.236 --> 01:43.837
I'm going back to jail
for another 20 years.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.308
I'll take care of it.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.742
You mean, take care, take care?

01:48.776 --> 01:51.479
No! I'll-I'll... I'll take him
to the hospital,

01:51.512 --> 01:53.481
and they'll take care of him.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.815
All right, I'm counting on you.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.717
As long as nobody talks,
we won't have any problems.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.286
He should be
a marriage counselor.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.587
Greg?
Oh.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.424
Greg? Wake up.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.331
Look, Greg, wake up.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.799
Wake up, Greg!

02:11.832 --> 02:13.601
Aw!

02:13.634 --> 02:16.870
Dude, you hit me with a car.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.573
Sounds like the title
of an Ashton Kutcher movie.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.689
* Ah, make it funky now.

CHRIS ROCK:
After running Greg down,

02:55.843 --> 02:58.379
my biggest concern
was getting him to shut up.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.713
This is just great.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.849
Just because I didn't want
to spend the week arguing

03:01.882 --> 03:04.485
didn't mean I wanted
to get hit by a car.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.919
That'll teach you
to be more specific.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.755
Be quiet! I did not hit you.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.457
Uh, yeah, you did.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.358
Shh!

03:10.391 --> 03:12.326
Gregory?

03:12.360 --> 03:15.296
I spoke with the doctor, and
he says you can't be released

03:15.329 --> 03:17.498
unless you have an
adult to take you home.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.367
Well, are my parents coming
to get me?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.602
Well... no.

03:21.635 --> 03:22.870
The hospital
can keep you

03:22.903 --> 03:24.238
for up to four days,

03:24.272 --> 03:25.906
and your parents'
vacation is for five.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.808
They think you're
in good hands here,

03:27.841 --> 03:29.710
and so they'll pick
you up on Friday.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.711
* Hold me now
Great.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.381
Ms. Morello, can I talk to you
for a minute?

03:33.414 --> 03:35.983
* Oh, oh, hold my heart...
I'll be right back.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.019
So, where were we?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.455
Oh, that's right.
You were trying to explain

03:41.489 --> 03:43.524
how you didn't run me over.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.626
No, I didn't.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.495
So that wasn't you
behind the steering wheel

03:47.528 --> 03:49.330
when my face smashed up
against the windshield?

03:49.363 --> 03:50.798
No, because if I had hit you,

03:50.831 --> 03:52.266
that meant
I was driving someone's car.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.934
And that someone would go
to jail

03:53.967 --> 03:56.837
for a really, really,
really long time if we snitched.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.939
So not only would
you be hurt,

03:58.972 --> 04:01.575
but he would
be hurt, also,

04:01.609 --> 04:04.778
and don't you think enough
people have been hurt already?

04:04.812 --> 04:06.780
Okay, I get it.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.782
You didn't hit me.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.451
Spoken just like Tina Turner.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.885
Thank you.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.921
You're welcome.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.956
But, uh, just between
you and me...

04:20.661 --> 04:23.564
I know it was you, Chris.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.633
I know it was you.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.742
While I was making it clear
that I didn't hit Greg,

04:34.775 --> 04:37.010
my family was getting ready
to hit the road.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.746
When are we leaving?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.848
We'll head for the beach
as soon as Chris gets home.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.583
Can't we just
leave him?
No.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.418
Can you just leave
me? I hate the sand.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.853
I don't know where
it comes from,

04:45.886 --> 04:47.888
and it gets into places
you can't get it out of.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.056
Like broke cousins.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.624
What

04:50.658 --> 04:52.526
I'm going to bury you

04:52.560 --> 04:54.462
in the sand at low tide
if you don't shut up.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.830
Nobody wants to go on this
stupid trip besides you.

04:56.864 --> 04:57.931
That's enough, you two.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.333
Oh!

04:59.367 --> 05:00.501
Is everything okay?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.536
No. Chris is at the hospital.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.004
What?!
He's fine.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.540
Greg was involved in a
hit-and-run accident.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.775
Oh, that's good.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.410
His leg is broken.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.445
I gonna have to
go pick them up.

05:11.479 --> 05:15.383
All right. Kids, take this
and all your stuff to the car.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.386
We were supposed to be leaving
for Amityville.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.753
She doesn't want
to go to Amityville.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.754
I know, baby,

05:20.788 --> 05:23.491
but maybe you guys should
go ahead without us.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.758
Told you.

05:24.792 --> 05:28.362
What? We've been saving up
for this trip for weeks.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.364
I know, baby,
but you know what?

05:30.398 --> 05:31.965
Greg's parents
are out of town,

05:31.999 --> 05:33.901
and he'll have to stay
in the hospital

05:33.934 --> 05:35.803
a whole week if
I don't get him.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.004
I'm disappointed,
Chris is disappointed.

05:37.037 --> 05:37.938
It's horrible.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.073
In other words,
she doesn't want to go.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.041
Are you sure?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.610
Yes, I'm sure.
Go ahead.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.111
You guys enjoy yourself
at the beach.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.446
Love you. Bye.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.715
I'm gonna
miss you.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.450
No, she won't.
Bye.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.852
TONYA:
Ma, tell him, Black
people go to the beach.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.822
DREW:
Ma, they don't. Can I just
stay with you? I can't...

05:54.855 --> 05:56.457
Call Dr. Graham,
get ER One prepped.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.626
Ah, my toe!
Ah, my foot!

05:58.659 --> 06:00.561
Okay, move it, people.
D-fib standing by.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.730
I need 10cc's of...

06:02.763 --> 06:04.565
Stat! Let's move it!

06:04.598 --> 06:05.766
Mm.

06:05.799 --> 06:06.967
What's going on?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.702
The Uncle of Sam
got somebody else.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.970
You mean the Son of Sam?

06:10.003 --> 06:11.138
Nah, they got him.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.573
This is the Uncle of Sam.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.007
He doesn't kill people--
he chokes them.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.409
GREG:
He chokes people?

06:15.443 --> 06:17.511
Unconscious.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.012
Over seven people so far.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.548
Yup, that mole still lives.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.550
All right, baby, now,
that's gonna itch,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.752
but you'll get
used to it.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.820
Unlike that mole.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.422
What?
Nothing.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.090
That mole is so big,

06:30.123 --> 06:32.025
SAG made us give it
a screen credit.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.727
So it's cool.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.829
My mom said you
can stay with us.

06:35.863 --> 06:36.930
Well, what about your vacation?

06:36.964 --> 06:39.533
Nobody wanted to go on
that stupid trip but Tonya.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.201
Drew doesn't like the
sand, I get sun rash,

06:41.234 --> 06:43.971
and ever since my mom saw Jaws
and The Amityville Horror,

06:44.004 --> 06:45.573
she won't step
foot on Long Island.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.040
Later, I found out

06:47.074 --> 06:49.142
that just because
Greg and I weren't talking

06:49.176 --> 06:50.811
didn't mean nobody was asking.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.145
Gregory, this officer needs

06:52.179 --> 06:53.881
to ask you a
few questions.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.183
Son, do you know who hit you?

06:56.216 --> 06:57.718
Uh...

06:57.751 --> 06:58.552
Was it a Black guy?

06:58.586 --> 06:59.787
Um, Greg's pretty tired.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.823
I think maybe
we should do this later.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.125
I know you're probably
still in shock,

07:05.158 --> 07:07.495
but I'd like you to take
a look at a few guys,

07:07.528 --> 07:09.963
see if you recognize anybody.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.165
Oh, my.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.668
I don't think
it was any of these guys.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.036
What about this one?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.505
Looks pretty mean.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.206
Hey, man, I work here.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.109
Hey, sweetie,

07:22.142 --> 07:23.511
you need something?

07:23.544 --> 07:24.878
Yeah, Greg's gonna need
a bedpan.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.146
Oh, okay.
I'm gonna need everybody

07:26.179 --> 07:27.748
to step out a minute, please.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.016
Now, let's go, boys.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.951
Don't worry, kid.
We'll catch this guy.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.185
You have my word.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.855
And I'll be
right back, okay?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.791
So, try and hold it,
'cause I need my gloves.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.828
Man, this is messed up.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.095
That's okay.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.997
We've survived worse things.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.567
Remember that time we survived
those Cuban drug runners?

07:48.769 --> 07:51.004
Where's the drugs?!

07:51.038 --> 07:51.939
We don't have any Coke,

07:51.972 --> 07:53.841
but there's a Pepsi machine
downstairs.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.477
(chain saw buzzing,
indistinct shouting)

08:01.882 --> 08:03.183
Yeah, and remember that time

08:03.216 --> 08:04.952
we got captured by
those Vietnamese guys?

08:11.258 --> 08:13.193
Mow!

08:18.265 --> 08:19.733
Mow! Mow!

08:19.767 --> 08:21.769
Come on!
Go ahead, Greg.

08:21.802 --> 08:22.302
Go ahead.
Mow.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.707
It's gonna be okay.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.009
It's gonna be all right.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.277
Mow!

08:32.245 --> 08:33.146
Go ahead.

08:35.783 --> 08:39.653
Go fish.

08:39.687 --> 08:40.153
Mow!

08:40.187 --> 08:41.855
Mow!

08:43.924 --> 08:47.094
Remember that time
we took out that mobster?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.600
Leave the gun.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.635
Take the Pop Tarts.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.585
Yeah, we've had
some pretty crazy times.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.855
Yeah. We have.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.123
Hey.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.357
So, you ready?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.992
Are you ever ready for that?

09:19.026 --> 09:21.161
Even though Greg's condition
was better,

09:21.194 --> 09:24.031
our situation seemed
like it kept getting worse.

09:24.064 --> 09:24.965
All I'm saying

09:24.998 --> 09:27.200
is the police better
find him before I do.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.336
My poor son got
one little friend,

09:29.369 --> 09:31.204
and somebody got the
nerve to try to kill him?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.606
Oh, no.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.241
Maybe the driver
didn't see him.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.709
Maybe he shouldn't
have been driving.

09:35.743 --> 09:36.710
That's right.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.311
No excuses.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.179
They better
not find him,

09:39.212 --> 09:41.048
'cause if they do,
I'm going to jail.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.316
She didn't get that upset
when I got shot.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.953
Ooh, we better get
inside, you guys.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.855
It sounds
like rain.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.794
Wow, there was no rain
in the forecast.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.230
Great, can we go home now?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.766
No, we're not
going anywhere.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.133
I paid for the motel.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.368
We're gonna stay
in the motel.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.169
Besides,

10:02.202 --> 10:04.037
it's probably
just a passing cloud.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.906
That's what they said
about Katrina.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.008
It better be.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.084
Not only was it raining
at the beach,

10:17.117 --> 10:19.753
back at home,
it was raining on my parade.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.288
Chris.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.356
You guys need to
eat so we can go.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.357
Go where?

10:24.391 --> 10:25.659
To the police station.

10:25.693 --> 10:26.727
They called
and said they

10:26.760 --> 10:27.995
have a suspect
in custody.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.130
A witness gave
a pretty good description.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.001
A witness?
A witness?

10:34.034 --> 10:36.203
The bad part
about committing a crime

10:36.236 --> 10:38.405
is that you're paying attention
to the crime.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.339
Give me your money.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.342
And not to who
is watching you do it.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.913
You hear something?

10:45.946 --> 10:49.049
Down at the precinct, somebody
was about to get fingered,

10:49.082 --> 10:51.251
and I was praying it
wasn't going to be me.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.153
Okay, you guys sit
down right here.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.688
I'll be right back.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.293
Dude, that's
the janitor.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.329
Where?
There.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.897
Oh, my God.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.365
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, no.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.800
What's wrong?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.268
Remember when I said
if we talked

11:08.301 --> 11:09.369
someone would go to jail?

11:09.402 --> 11:10.971
He's that someone.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.706
It was his car.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.110
GREG:
Wait, dude,
I don't get this.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.746
Your mom said they
had someone in custody.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.981
He's in disguise,
but he's not in custody.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.382
Wait,

11:22.415 --> 11:24.317
so if they didn't
arrest me

11:24.351 --> 11:25.886
and they didn't
arrest him,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.921
who did they arrest?

11:27.955 --> 11:29.990
Number three,
step forward.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.462
Chris, isn't that
your wrestling coach?

11:35.495 --> 11:38.698
I guess that answers
who they arrested.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.472
CHRIS ROCK:
An important lesson to learn:

11:45.505 --> 11:47.808
if you don't want
to be accused of a crime,

11:47.841 --> 11:49.442
don't have a twin
who's a criminal.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.978
Why'd you arrest
our coach?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.279
The witness
described the car

11:52.312 --> 11:53.313
she saw leaving
the scene.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.848
He's the owner
of the car

11:54.882 --> 11:56.850
that matched
that description.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.485
Well, that's not
the guy who hit me.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.286
Well, maybe he is.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.721
Does this jog your
memory, Greg?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.092
No.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.493
How about now?

12:10.931 --> 12:13.366
No, it's not
Coach Brantley.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.402
It's not any of those guys.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.237
I told you I didn't know.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.240
So, you saw him,
but just didn't know him?

12:20.273 --> 12:21.474
This is good.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.342
You're starting
to remember.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.211
Let's get you with
our sketch artist,

12:24.244 --> 12:27.747
and you can describe what
the driver looks like.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.352
DETECTIVE:
Let's go.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.522
I was afraid the police
had broke Greg

12:35.555 --> 12:38.225
and he described
his hit and run driver: me.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.427
Uh, I need to go
to the bathroom.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.230
This was back in the '80s
when going to the bathroom

12:43.263 --> 12:45.398
in police stations
was still safe.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.802
Come on, we
need to talk.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.337
What happened?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.372
Look, there's nothing
to worry about.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.540
You sure about that?

12:53.573 --> 12:55.508
Yeah.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.377
I mean, I know
that there are people

12:57.410 --> 12:59.412
that would be very upset
if they were ever implicated

12:59.446 --> 13:02.382
in any way in my accidental
car accident.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.516
CHRIS:
Yeah, and if we

13:03.550 --> 13:05.485
knew anything, which we don't,

13:05.518 --> 13:07.354
we wouldn't talk,
which we haven't.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.158
There you are.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.325
Can you believe this?

13:12.359 --> 13:14.494
Yeah... uh, no, no.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.428
What happened
in there?

13:15.462 --> 13:16.897
It's crazy.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.332
These cops, they drag me
down here, talking about

13:19.366 --> 13:21.001
I ran some kid over
outside the school.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.002
That's nuts.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.036
I got a nice ride.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.537
I want to hit a kid,
I'll punch him

13:24.571 --> 13:26.473
in the face, I'm not
gonna dent my car.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.209
You know, those cops
are crazy, cuz.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.444
They bring you down here
for nothing.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.947
29 times
I get arrested.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.148
For nothing.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.850
You and DMX.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.518
Yeah, it's crazy.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.520
What are you guys
doing here?

13:40.553 --> 13:41.488
I don't know.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.323
We're here with my mom.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.525
She's thinking
about applying for a job

13:45.558 --> 13:47.560
as a crossing guard.
Yeah.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.329
Well, if kids are
getting run over

13:49.362 --> 13:51.564
outside the school,
they need one.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.299
We got to go.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.501
So, what did you
tell the cops?

13:54.534 --> 13:55.335
Don't worry.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.370
I described a guy
they'll never find.

13:57.404 --> 14:00.473
Man, I didn't hit a kid
with a car.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.075
This is New York City.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.977
I take the subway everywhere
or I walk.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.612
I don't even drive.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.514
Isn't that
Kristoff St. John?

14:07.547 --> 14:09.249
Yep.
That's not him.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.583
That guy...

14:10.617 --> 14:13.120
is this guy.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.554
I'm telling you,
it's not him.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.622
I must have
been nervous.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.124
Take another look.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.328
Kristoff St. John
didn't hit me.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.930
Yeah, he's right,
that's not him.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.465
Boy, I thought you said
you didn't see anything.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.433
Yeah, dummy.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.602
Oh, now that I think about it,
it's kind of

14:29.636 --> 14:31.371
all coming back.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.341
As I came around the corner,
I think I might

14:34.374 --> 14:35.575
have caught a glimpse
of the driver.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.611
Well, let's get you
with the sketch artist.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.580
Jesse from All My Children,
you're next.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.616
So, what, uh,
does this mean

14:43.650 --> 14:45.953
that Kristoff St. John
is innocent?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.320
I'm afraid so.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.558
Hold on a moment, Greg.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.329
Kristoff!

14:57.730 --> 14:59.532
Can I get your autograph?!

14:59.566 --> 15:01.368
I am your biggest fan!

15:01.401 --> 15:03.236
While I was dodging
another bullet,

15:03.270 --> 15:05.572
raindrops kept falling
on my father's head.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.107
This place
is amazing.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.708
They got free shampoo,
conditioner and soap.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.943
It was kind
of hard

15:09.977 --> 15:11.044
to go to the bathroom

15:11.078 --> 15:12.579
with that strip of paper
across the seat.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.282
I did it, though.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.651
This is great.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.288
Dad, we got to get one of these.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.490
This is the worst vacation ever.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.192
We haven't even seen the beach.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.193
I'm sorry, baby.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.561
If I could, I would bring
the beach inside.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.735
My father's spring break
had gotten rained out,

15:35.768 --> 15:38.972
and my mother was enjoying
being stretched out.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.978
Hello?

15:45.012 --> 15:46.113
Rochelle, it's me.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.681
Hey, baby.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.652
What's wrong?

15:52.685 --> 15:55.022
It's been raining ever since we
got here, that's what's wrong.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.723
This is the worst vacation ever.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.426
Oh, baby, that's too bad.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.528
I feel like packing up
and coming home tonight.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.730
No, no, no, no.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.498
No, no, don't do that.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.567
Why not?
Because she's on vacation
from you.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.704
Well, maybe you should travel
during the day when it clears.

16:11.738 --> 16:15.108
And I-I'm sure the kids
are having a great time.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.676
She's on vacation
from them, too.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.311
Dad, there's
something wrong

16:18.345 --> 16:19.712
with the sea turtle
you got me.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.781
It's not a sea turtle;
it's a tortoise.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.583
Turtle, tortoise...
you know how hard

16:23.616 --> 16:25.218
it was for me to
catch that thing?

16:25.252 --> 16:28.455
Well, it couldn't have
been moving that fast.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.522
That's it.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.590
I'll see you in the morning.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.759
No, no, wait, wait,
baby, baby...

16:35.295 --> 16:38.065
After I talked to the cops,
I was hoping they

16:38.098 --> 16:39.699
were drawing
a whole new conclusion.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.669
Man, I hope this is over.
Trust me.

16:42.702 --> 16:46.173
Unlike you, I described a guy
they'll never be able to find.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.241
Kristoff St. John.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.778
Thanks for making me
breakfast, Chris,

16:51.811 --> 16:54.747
but can you go down to Doc's
and get some orange juice?

16:54.781 --> 16:57.117
I hate to ask, but, you know,

16:57.150 --> 16:59.386
I can't walk.
And you won't be able to eat

16:59.419 --> 17:01.721
when I hit you upside the head
with the frying pan.

17:01.754 --> 17:02.689
It's raining.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.291
Dude,
you hit me

17:04.324 --> 17:05.792
with a car, broke my leg,

17:05.825 --> 17:07.660
and then made me lie
to the cops.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.764
I think the least you can do
is get me some OJ.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.133
Fine.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.405
DETECTIVE:
Ah, good.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.307
We found that guy you described.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.775
Oh, no, the cops got Jesse!

17:27.847 --> 17:30.217
I did what I could so nobody
got taken down,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.219
and in the end,
I got caught up.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.220
This is bad.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.688
I can't let some guy go
to jail for what I did.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.790
I got to turn
myself in.
Hang on, Chris.

17:37.824 --> 17:38.691
Let's think about this.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.760
If you turn yourself in,
you'll go to jail

17:40.793 --> 17:42.595
for hitting me,
the janitor will go back

17:42.629 --> 17:44.464
to prison for leaving
the scene of a crime,

17:44.497 --> 17:46.533
and I'll go to jail
for lying to the police.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.800
What about the guy
they arrested, huh?

17:47.834 --> 17:49.669
Do we just let his
life get ruined

17:49.702 --> 17:51.338
and we go about
with our happy lives?

17:51.371 --> 17:53.773
I wouldn't call it happy,
but I know what you mean.

17:53.806 --> 17:54.807
Yes.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.210
No, I can't do this.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.112
Excuse me, Officer,
I got something I need

17:59.146 --> 18:00.380
to tell you.
Just a second.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.614
They're bringing
the guy in now.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.750
There he is.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.787
You'll never take me alive!

18:14.327 --> 18:16.563
I thought the truth
would set me free,

18:16.596 --> 18:19.399
but instead,
it darn near got me killed.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.536
Chris, the city
of New York

18:23.570 --> 18:24.604
owes you a debt
of gratitude.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.839
Your description of Greg's
hit and run assailant

18:26.873 --> 18:28.841
led us to the Uncle of Sam.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.510
The serial choker?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.412
Yes, ma'am,
but he was escalating.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.781
He went from choking
to plowing down.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.149
Who knows what
was next?

18:36.183 --> 18:37.750
You're a brave
kid, Chris.

18:37.784 --> 18:38.818
No, I'm not.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.721
While the Uncle of Sam
got sent up the river,

18:41.754 --> 18:44.391
my father drove home
in the rain.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.909
Ain't this about a...

19:02.942 --> 19:04.844
After all was said and done,

19:04.877 --> 19:07.547
Greg had something
to say about what we did.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.948
Hey, man, what's
the matter?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.783
We put the wrong man
in jail.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.918
Wrong man?

19:11.951 --> 19:13.320
He was a serial choker.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.554
Yeah, but he
didn't hit me

19:14.587 --> 19:15.922
with the car;
you did.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.391
Okay, so I hit you with
the car, but if I hadn't,

19:18.425 --> 19:20.260
they would have never
caught the Uncle of Sam,

19:20.293 --> 19:21.494
so we did a good thing.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.695
Yeah, I guess.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.896
The more important
thing is

19:23.930 --> 19:24.897
we got away with it.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.065
No, we didn't.
Yeah, we did.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.601
Nobody knows about
this but me and you.
And your mother.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.337
She doesn't
know anything.
Yeah, she does.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.904
She's standing behind
me, isn't she?

19:31.938 --> 19:33.606
Yep.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.348
GREG:
Oh, God.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.649
I'm okay.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.251
You're the one who hit Greg?

19:44.284 --> 19:45.585
It was an accident.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.654
Why didn't you
just tell the truth?

19:47.687 --> 19:48.855
'Cause it
was someone else's car.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.290
I thought they'd go to jail.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.859
Hitting someone with a car
is not illegal.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.894
Lying to the police is.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.764
Ma, I know you're mad,

19:57.797 --> 19:59.232
but it's over.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.267
It all worked out.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.468
It's not a big deal.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.938
You broke your friend's leg,
you both lied to the police,

20:05.972 --> 20:08.007
we were in the middle
of a police shootout

20:08.040 --> 20:09.809
with a serial choker,

20:09.842 --> 20:11.711
and you don't think
it's a big deal?

20:11.744 --> 20:13.846
Not in Bed-Stuy.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.782
Is it a big deal now?

20:18.918 --> 20:22.255
So, what did they
get you for?

20:22.289 --> 20:24.257
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:24.291 --> 20:28.227
