00:38.959 --> 00:40.625
Who-Who's that funny for?

00:40.667 --> 00:42.959
I'll tell you who it's
not funny for. The busboy.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.625
It's kinda funny.

00:44.667 --> 00:46.083
Announcement.

00:46.125 --> 00:48.041
Since y'all are like
my closest friends
in the world,

00:48.083 --> 00:50.291
I wanted to invite you
to my houseboat this Saturday.

00:50.333 --> 00:51.917
That's sweet of you.
I'm flattered.

00:51.959 --> 00:53.792
You're so generous,
and your feet are adorable.

00:53.834 --> 00:56.333
The best part is spring break
starts this weekend,

00:56.375 --> 00:58.917
so the lake is gonna be crazy!

00:58.959 --> 01:00.834
I thought we could make
"Sluts Gone Nuts" T-shirts

01:00.875 --> 01:02.500
to get girls
to show us their taytays.

01:02.542 --> 01:03.542
Check it out.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.333
Supplies, biatch.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.917
Oh, yeah!
Cool! I'm writing
the name!

01:07.959 --> 01:10.583
Ah, damn it.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.792
It's the dad phone.
Oh, that reminds me.

01:12.834 --> 01:14.542
I have to check
my sad phone.

01:14.583 --> 01:17.375
You have zero messages.

01:17.417 --> 01:19.166
I don't believe this.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.333
Francine caught my son
trying to ditch
his P.S.A.T. prep class

01:22.375 --> 01:24.166
so he could go to the zoo.

01:24.208 --> 01:25.875
Sorry, guys.
I gotta go handle this.

01:25.917 --> 01:27.709
Dick, will you decorate
my T-shirt?

01:27.750 --> 01:29.917
You know what colors I like.
You got it.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.125
He likes yellow,
brown and green.

01:32.166 --> 01:35.166
He used to like red,
but lately he said
he's over it.

01:35.208 --> 01:37.166
Hmm. That's a shame.
Red's great.

01:37.208 --> 01:39.291
I think red stuff
looks amazing.

01:42.959 --> 01:44.834
Steven Anita Smith.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.625
I told him to sit in his room
until you got home.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.875
I figured you'd want
to do the punishing.

01:49.917 --> 01:51.834
And I figured you would have
vacuumed the plant gravel

01:51.875 --> 01:53.959
out of the trunk
of my car by now.

01:55.125 --> 01:57.583
So, big shot tried
to go to the zoo...

01:57.625 --> 02:00.792
instead of his
P.S.A.T. prep course.
I know it was wrong,

02:00.834 --> 02:03.875
but my friend Wilson
said he could get me into
the new gorilla habitat.

02:03.917 --> 02:07.250
I am suspending all your TV
and video game privileges.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.667
And from here on out,
I will personally
be taking you

02:09.667 --> 02:11.750
to and from every
P.S.A.T. course.

02:11.792 --> 02:13.959
Ah. You're being so uncool.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.792
Hey, I'm not here
to be your friend, Steve.
I'm your dad.

02:16.834 --> 02:20.375
That's why your number's
in the dad phone
and not my friend phone.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.625
Friend phone conversations
go like this.

02:22.667 --> 02:24.417
What up, Jackson?

02:24.458 --> 02:27.792
Of course I wanna hang out
and ride 10-speeds or whatever.

02:27.834 --> 02:29.959
Dad phone conversations
go like this.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.834
Ah, damn it.

02:31.875 --> 02:34.542
Damn it, damn it, damn it.
I'll come home and handle it.

02:34.583 --> 02:37.083
I don't know. In five minutes.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.792
We gotta get the bill
and figure out how much I owe.

02:39.834 --> 02:42.542
I can't stiff these guys
just 'cause my son's acting up.

02:42.583 --> 02:46.291
Honey, that's not fair.
I told you I was going out
for a drink this morning.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.083
Yes, I did, in the kitchen.
Maybe you weren't listening.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.375
I-I-- Look, I gotta go.
You want me home, right?

02:51.417 --> 02:53.417
I can't come home
if I'm on the phone.

02:53.458 --> 02:55.208

Right in the middle of the ass.

Watch. Anybody can do it.

You can't fake
country music, Roger.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.667
It comes from a lifetime
of pain and hard living.

03:56.709 --> 03:58.583
I want some of that.

03:58.625 --> 04:02.166

I can have a song

Hat rack.

04:05.583 --> 04:07.834

Unbearable.

04:07.875 --> 04:09.417
Perfect.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.041
Will you marry me?

04:11.083 --> 04:13.250
Sure. Screw it.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.709
This is all your fault.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.834
I'm supposed to be
with my friends
on the houseboat.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.208
You don't have
to keep picking me up
from P.S.A.T. class.

04:22.250 --> 04:25.583
No, I don't?
What do I have to do,
master?

04:25.625 --> 04:28.166
What a dick.

04:28.208 --> 04:29.458
Hello?

04:29.500 --> 04:31.875
Stan, where are you?
We're ready to cast off.

04:31.917 --> 04:34.333
I'm caught in traffic,
taking Steve home.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.500
Reginald's not gonna hold
the boat much longer.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.500
He's doing the little dance
he does when he's impatient.

04:38.542 --> 04:41.166
We gotta go!

04:41.208 --> 04:43.625
Just bring Steve with you.
You have to hurry.

04:43.667 --> 04:46.250
I'm on my way.

04:46.291 --> 04:49.125
Close your eyes, Steve.
I don't want you
to see me drive like this.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.458
Aah! Ooh! Ooh! Aah!

05:00.792 --> 05:02.166
It's not funny.

05:02.208 --> 05:03.667
It's kinda funny.

05:07.792 --> 05:10.458
Yay! Let's go!
I got Ziplocs
for everyone's wallet.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.000
We already saw a girl.

05:13.709 --> 05:15.750
Just give me
a second, fellas.

05:17.583 --> 05:21.375
You're staying here.
I've got no time
to act like a parent today.

05:21.417 --> 05:24.041
Leave that running.
I don't want you to hear
anything we say out there.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.959
Our words
are not for you.

05:32.083 --> 05:35.250
Aw, man.
What's up with Frank
and the schedule?

05:36.208 --> 05:38.291
Ah! Frank!

05:39.834 --> 05:42.041
Son of a-- Frank.

05:42.083 --> 05:44.667
I missed
my kid's birthday
for this.

05:46.458 --> 05:47.959
Frank!

05:53.250 --> 05:56.959
This is it.
Kids, come meet
your new daddy.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.917
It's perfect. We're poor.
We got too many kids.
It stinks to high heaven.

06:00.959 --> 06:03.500
This will inspire
one hell of a country song.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.583
Just need a macchiato
to get me going.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.375
Where's our
espresso maker, dear?

06:07.417 --> 06:08.917
The what?

06:08.959 --> 06:12.625
No, thank you!

06:21.375 --> 06:23.709
Steve, what the hell
are you doing outside
the bathroom?

06:23.750 --> 06:25.792
Jackson came in
to doo-doo
and let me out.

06:25.834 --> 06:28.917
After he was done.
I'm better
in front of somebody.

06:28.959 --> 06:33.125
Steve just told the most
hilarious, filthy joke.
You have to hear it.

06:33.166 --> 06:36.250
I'm not gonna share
a dirty joke with my son.
It's inappropriate.

06:36.291 --> 06:38.709
Stan,
it's just a joke.
Lighten up.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.792
Fine. One joke.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.208
Then back
in the bathroom.
Okay, here goes.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.458
So, a man with a tickle
in his throat--

06:45.500 --> 06:47.792
And the donkey looks him
straight in the eye,

06:47.834 --> 06:49.792
and without missing
a beat, says,

06:49.834 --> 06:51.000
"Purple hat."

06:53.709 --> 06:55.250
Okay.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.375
What's wrong, Stan?
You didn't like it?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.417
Actually, I thought
it was very well crafted--

06:59.458 --> 07:01.667
the perfect combination
of dirty and smart.

07:01.709 --> 07:03.291
It was really
quite elegant.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.875
Well, why aren't
you laughing?

07:04.917 --> 07:07.041
Because I don't share laughs
with my son.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.500
There's nothing wrong
with laughing, Dad.

07:09.542 --> 07:11.417
I said I don't need to laugh.

07:11.458 --> 07:12.959
Purple hat, Dad.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.625
Steve, Steve, stop it.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.417
I'm not doing anything.

07:16.458 --> 07:20.375
It was the donkey.
He said, "Purple hat."

07:20.417 --> 07:22.250
Don't-Don't you
mess with me!

07:22.291 --> 07:24.917
It's okay.
It's okay.

07:24.959 --> 07:26.625
"Purple hat."

07:28.417 --> 07:30.125
"Purple hat."

07:30.166 --> 07:32.500
That's what was said...

07:32.542 --> 07:34.458
by the donkey.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.417
Oh, for God's sake,
get this boy a T-shirt.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.625
Yeah!
Put that shirt
on that boy.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.250
Attaboy!

07:50.125 --> 07:53.667
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

07:53.709 --> 07:55.834
Steve, you don't know

07:55.875 --> 07:58.000
how gl-- how glad I am
to be done...

07:58.041 --> 08:00.125
with all
that father-son crap.

08:00.166 --> 08:02.083
It's buddy-buddy
from here on out.

08:02.125 --> 08:05.250
That means so much to me.

08:05.291 --> 08:08.750
Look. I'm taking you
out of the dad phone...

08:08.792 --> 08:10.917
and I'm putting you
in the friend phone.

08:10.959 --> 08:12.500
It's offi-ficial.

08:12.542 --> 08:15.041
Oh, my God.
Thanks, Dad.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.291
Hey.
What?

08:16.333 --> 08:18.792
Y-Y-You can call me Stan.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.792
- They got me, y'all.
- Watch my boat.

08:29.125 --> 08:32.417
That was amazing.
You-- You are
super fun, man.

08:32.458 --> 08:35.709
You're fun.
I love being friends
with you, Stan.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.709
Hey, let's make
some nachos,
melt some queso.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.959
Yes!

08:41.000 --> 08:43.500
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Knock, knock.

08:43.542 --> 08:46.000
Oh, are you-- are you
doing a knock-knock--
knock-knock joke?

08:46.041 --> 08:48.709
Yeah, yeah.
You just made me think of it.
Knock, knock.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.542
Who's there?

08:50.583 --> 08:52.583
Queso.
Queso who?

08:54.542 --> 08:56.041
'Kay, so I farted.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.583
Yes.

08:58.625 --> 09:02.041
Hey, you wanna wake up
early tomorrow
and go for a run?

09:02.083 --> 09:04.458
Oh, definitely.
You wanna say, like, 7:00?

09:04.500 --> 09:07.208
7:15, to be safe.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.458
There you are.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.000
What time did
you and your dad
get home last night?

09:14.041 --> 09:15.750
He wouldn't even budge
this morning.

09:15.792 --> 09:18.875
Ah, don't know.
It's kind of blurry.

09:18.917 --> 09:22.083
Good Lord.
You smell like a brewery.

09:22.125 --> 09:24.667
Did your father let you
drink beer last night?

09:24.709 --> 09:26.000
Um--

09:31.041 --> 09:33.125
Ah! You have been drinking.

09:34.709 --> 09:38.250
Stan, how could you let
Steve get drunk last night?

09:38.291 --> 09:40.542
It was a mistake, Francine.
I wasn't thinking straight.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.542
I was with my friends.
We had some drinks.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.208
We were on a boat.
I was-- I was boat-notized.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.083
Boat-notized?

09:47.125 --> 09:49.834
Oh! Like ship-notized?

09:49.875 --> 09:52.583
Ship-notized?
Ah, that-that
means nothing.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.458
Look, I told Steve
to stay away
from the adult activity,

09:55.500 --> 09:57.125
but he disobeyed me.
What?

09:57.166 --> 09:58.834
Stan, he needs
to be punished.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.208
Oh, don't worry.
He will be.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.667
Dad, I don't understand
why I'm in trouble.

10:03.709 --> 10:05.709
Dude, dude, dude.
Francine's lame,
all right?

10:05.750 --> 10:07.250
It's cool.
We're cool.
Wait.

10:07.291 --> 10:09.583
So you're not gonna punish me
like Mom said?

10:09.625 --> 10:12.959
Come on, we're boys now.
Bros before hos, my man.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.917
Brothers before whores
all day long.

10:15.959 --> 10:17.875
And Mom's the whore
in that situation?

10:17.917 --> 10:20.458
All day long.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.875
Hey, what happened
to being a country singer?

10:29.917 --> 10:32.125
Oh, living the honky-tonk life
is too hard.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.834
I'm doing calypso dancing now.
I don't blame you.

10:34.875 --> 10:37.375
The woman you ran off with
was a mess.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.959
Did she have a tattoo
of Burt Reynolds
on her stomach?

10:40.000 --> 10:43.375
No, she didn't.
It's Victor from The Young
and the Restless.

10:45.875 --> 10:48.333
You're comin' with me,
you son of a bitch.

10:48.375 --> 10:51.166
We're married. You got
a family to look after.

10:51.208 --> 10:54.542
Oh. Oh, sorry. No.
No, you've got me confused
with someone else.

10:54.583 --> 10:58.250
I'm a Caribbean dancer.
The name's Calypso
Banana Puffy-Sleeves.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.709
You call yourself
whatever the hell you want,

11:00.750 --> 11:02.959
but you're my husband
and you're comin' home
with me.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.625
Hey, Maurice, I'm gonna have
to cancel on you today.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.834
I'm sorry to make you
drive all the way down here.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.125
Eh, no problem,
Mr. Sleeves.

11:17.959 --> 11:21.834
Sometimes I think music
is the one thing
that can save the world.

11:21.875 --> 11:24.834
Sometimes I think
Francine fakes
her orgasms.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.333
Well, through the wall,
it sounds like
you're slayin' it.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.375
Thanks, man.

11:29.417 --> 11:32.625
- What's going on in here?
- Me and Steve are just hangin'.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.625
Is that supposed to be part
of Steve's punishment?

11:35.667 --> 11:37.709
Hey, Stan,
you think Mom's mad,

11:37.750 --> 11:39.709
or do you think
she's just faking it?

11:39.750 --> 11:41.875
- Nice one.
- What does that mean?

11:41.917 --> 11:43.917
Nothing, dear.
Inside joke.
You wouldn't get it.

11:43.959 --> 11:45.542
Apparently she never does.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.125
Hi-yo!

11:56.500 --> 11:58.875
Stop running.
I'm trying to get
the baby to sleep.

11:58.917 --> 12:01.250
What are you looking at?
Don't look at me.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.333
You speak English?
You need a kick in the head?

12:03.375 --> 12:05.041
Ah, screw it.

12:05.083 --> 12:08.500
Naydern, I'm, uh--
I'm gonna go get
some... cigarettes.

12:08.542 --> 12:11.458
That's the same thing my ex said
and he never came back.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.959
Okay, relax.
You're right.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.750
Oh, my God! Tornado!

12:18.125 --> 12:21.000
My daddy never came back
'cause I shot him.

12:28.458 --> 12:29.792
Shello.

12:29.834 --> 12:32.083
Dude, what are you
up to right now?
Boring work.

12:32.125 --> 12:35.291
You need to tell Bullock
you're sick and come
meet me at the zoo.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.458
You're at the zoo?
Shouldn't you be at school?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.542
Wow. You sound like
a total dad right now.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.375
Oh, no, no.
I'm just saying--

12:41.417 --> 12:44.000
Look, today's the final day
of this amazing
gorilla exhibit.

12:44.041 --> 12:46.083
Don't be lame.
I'm not lame.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.583
If you're not lame,
then meet my ass
down here.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.959
Fine. I'll meet your ass.
I'll meet your ass right now.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.917
That's what I'm
talkin' about. Peace.

12:53.959 --> 12:56.959
Wow. That was an awesome way
to get off the phone.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.750
I said kill them!
Kill them all!

12:59.792 --> 13:01.500
Yes, yes! Them too!

13:01.542 --> 13:02.959
Also them!

13:03.000 --> 13:05.750
No, not him!
That's me.

13:05.792 --> 13:06.917
Idiots.

13:06.959 --> 13:08.041
What is it?

13:08.083 --> 13:09.834
Sir, I'm not
feeling so well.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.792
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. Stan.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.750
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.417
I hate that.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.542
Come here.

13:18.583 --> 13:20.458
I wish it were me.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.834
I wish I could just
absorb your germs and make
my body fight them.

13:24.875 --> 13:27.542
I-I-I-I think--
I think I'll be okay
if I just go home.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.333
Absolutely.

13:29.375 --> 13:32.417
Whatever you need.
Just get better.

13:32.458 --> 13:36.917
It makes me so angry
that little viruses
can just traipse in here

13:36.959 --> 13:39.917
and treat your body
like a playground.

13:39.959 --> 13:42.542
It-It's all right, sir.
I should be better
by tomorrow.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.208
I-- I just-- I just
feel so helpless,
you know.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.500
It's really not that bad.

13:47.542 --> 13:51.041
Have we displeased you,
Almighty God in heaven?

13:51.083 --> 13:53.458
Do our lives mean
nothing to you?

14:01.667 --> 14:04.458
All right!
Stan the man's here!

14:04.500 --> 14:07.083
Told you I'd be here,
didn't I?
Who's this guy?

14:07.125 --> 14:09.333
That's Wilson.
He's a total dirtbag.

14:09.375 --> 14:12.166
Dirt a-bag.

14:12.208 --> 14:15.709
Wilson's gonna give us
the keys to go inside
the gorilla enclosure.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.667
Isn't that amazing?

14:17.709 --> 14:20.000
I thought we were just
gonna look at gorillas.

14:20.041 --> 14:22.667
I'm not going in there.
And honestly, Steve,
I don't think you should either.

14:22.709 --> 14:24.458
That's weak sauce, Stan.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.750
Do not enter that sauce
in the county fair
because it is weak.

14:27.792 --> 14:30.625
I'm going solo, Wilson.
Let's do this.

14:37.291 --> 14:39.083
Wow!

14:39.125 --> 14:41.500
It's even more amazing than I--

14:41.542 --> 14:43.375
What's happening, Wilson?

14:43.417 --> 14:46.542
Look at that
silly gorilla.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.208
It's not funny, Wilson.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.917
It's kinda funny.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.709
I don't like this.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.792
The zookeeper's here, Steve.
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.333
Well, I never said
everything is
gonna be okay.

15:25.375 --> 15:28.583
That's a gorilla.
I mean, how could you let
your son go in there?

15:28.625 --> 15:30.709
I didn't let him go in. I--

15:30.750 --> 15:33.083
Look, what happened was,
I was at work...

15:33.125 --> 15:36.166
and he told me
to meet his ass down here,
so I met his ass down here.

15:39.834 --> 15:42.917
What's he doing?

15:42.959 --> 15:45.083
Can't you shoot it
with a tranquilizer
or something?

15:45.125 --> 15:47.709
Yeah, if we do,
he could seize up
and crush the boy.

15:47.750 --> 15:50.333
We need to wait
for Bobo's personal handler.

15:50.375 --> 15:53.875
Unfortunately, he's
at a matinee right now.
I hope he picks up.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.875
Hello.

15:56.917 --> 15:59.250
Is it an emergency?
Shh.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.583
Well, when was
the last time Bobo ate?

16:01.625 --> 16:03.625
Shh.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.625
That long?
Oh, this isn't good.

16:05.667 --> 16:08.875
Excuse me.
Some of us are trying
to watch this porno.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.291
Ugh!

16:12.333 --> 16:13.834
Give me that!

16:13.875 --> 16:15.542
- Give it to me!
- Give it back!

16:15.583 --> 16:17.500
You better not
be sleepin' in there!

16:17.542 --> 16:20.417
Dog's scoochin'
on the floor again. You need
to squeeze out his butthole.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.875
Just a minute, baby.

16:25.917 --> 16:27.542
Hello. 911?

16:29.709 --> 16:33.583
You let go of me.
I never touched
that son of a bitch.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.291
Yes, you did, Naydern.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.458
She said she was gonna
scissors off my hog.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.417
We wanna go
with our mama.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.125
Sorry. You kids are
gonna be split up
and placed in foster care.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.250
Wait. You can't
keep 'em all together?

16:44.250 --> 16:47.000
No way. We'll be lucky
to find them
any homes at all.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.417
I want Mama!

16:49.458 --> 16:50.917
Raji!

16:59.458 --> 17:00.834
Aah!

17:00.875 --> 17:04.083
Looks like you've
been through
some hard times.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.959
Actually, I was fine
until I saw that face of yours.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.125
It's painful
just to look at you.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.250
Oh, my God.

17:14.291 --> 17:17.041
I think
I understand country music.

17:20.375 --> 17:24.250

17:24.291 --> 17:27.709

17:53.875 --> 17:56.041
It's gonna kill him.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.333
Hold tight, Steve.
The handler's on his way.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.208
You've been saying that
for 20 minutes.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.834
Steve, I'm coming in
to get you.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.417
That's enough, Bobo.

18:12.333 --> 18:13.667
No, Bobo.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.166
Chill out, Bobo.

18:19.208 --> 18:22.000
Hello.

18:22.041 --> 18:26.208
Hi, Stan.
Just checking to see
when I can expect you home.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.917
Oh, normal time.
Everything's normal.
Why would you ask?

18:28.959 --> 18:33.041
Oh, because you and Steve
are all over the news right now!

18:33.083 --> 18:36.125
According to sources,
Langley Falls resident
Stan Smith, quote,

18:36.166 --> 18:38.250
"Got his ass down here,"
end quote,

18:38.291 --> 18:40.417
to meet his son
on a school day.

18:40.458 --> 18:43.959
You better hope
that gorilla kills you
before I get there, Stan.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.291
Oh, God.
What do I do?

18:49.375 --> 18:52.125
It's a simple waltz, Steve.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.667
Bobo, I need you
to let these people go.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.875
Bobo's handler.
We're saved.

18:57.709 --> 18:59.583
Not exactly.

18:59.625 --> 19:02.667
He just said he wants the boy
to stay with him tonight.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.792
I don't wanna die
from gorilla sex.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.750
Looks like there might
be a threesome, Steve.

19:12.792 --> 19:16.291
That's, uh, Rex,
Bobo's father.
I'm his handler.

19:16.333 --> 19:19.041
He said--
"What do you think
you're doing, Son?

19:19.083 --> 19:20.208
You woke me up."

19:21.417 --> 19:23.417
"I'm just playing, Dad."

19:23.458 --> 19:25.500
"Look at all the commotion
you've caused.

19:25.542 --> 19:28.583
"You think
you'll get into a good
captive breeding program

19:28.625 --> 19:30.125
"acting like this?

19:30.166 --> 19:32.750
Get inside right now."

19:32.792 --> 19:34.917
"But this boy's father's
letting him play."

19:34.959 --> 19:36.959
"You call that man
a father?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.458
No respectable parent
would let their child
in here."

19:40.500 --> 19:43.792
Hey, for your information, Rex,
my son and I work better
as friends.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.959
"I'm sure you do.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.625
"Friends don't have
to worry about discipline
or setting an example.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.792
"It's easy to be a friend.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.166
"That's why kids
have lots of them.

19:54.208 --> 19:58.542
"But a father-- our kids
only get one of those.

19:58.583 --> 20:01.667
"Who are we to take that
away from them?

20:04.500 --> 20:06.709
"Now, come along, Bobo.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.250
You're grounded
for three moons."

20:10.792 --> 20:13.125
"I love you too, Dad."

20:14.583 --> 20:17.041
Oh, Daddy,
if you're watching,
I forgive you.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.291
Hey, Tank,
ain't that your boy?
What?

20:19.333 --> 20:21.667
No. No.
Uh, that's not my kid.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.125
That's my son.

20:32.041 --> 20:34.333
He seems pretty cool.

20:37.583 --> 20:39.500
How crazy was that?

20:39.542 --> 20:41.667
Put your fist away
right now.
Uh-oh.

20:41.709 --> 20:44.125
You're making up
all the schoolwork
you missed today,

20:44.166 --> 20:46.125
plus extra credit.
Yes, sir.

20:46.166 --> 20:48.291
There you are.
How dare you--

20:48.333 --> 20:50.583
Lie to you and lose
all control of my son?

20:50.625 --> 20:52.792
I'll be able to think
about that long and hard

20:52.834 --> 20:55.625
while I'm cleaning
the gutters and buying you
a diamond bracelet, won't I?

20:55.667 --> 20:57.709
Uh-- Yes, you will.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.333
Damn right I will.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.750
I'm going straight
to the most expensive
jewelry store I can find

21:01.792 --> 21:03.709
to buy the most
expensive bracelet they got.

21:09.166 --> 21:11.083
How much for that?
Fifty bucks.
