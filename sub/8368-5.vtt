WEBVTT

00:00.551 --> 00:02.919
This is a really successful
character.

00:02.953 --> 00:05.221
That's a rough one, man.

00:05.256 --> 00:07.891
It's such
a well-synthesized character.

00:09.126 --> 00:10.560
<i>McKenzie:

I like that.

I'm getting claustrophobic
'cause I'm so stressed.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.747
Hey, guys,
I need you to stop working.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.383
This is just really
fucking scary.

00:35.352 --> 00:37.053
I think it's pretty damn good.

00:37.087 --> 00:38.254
This doesn't quite make it.

- What?
- Ooh, scary.

01:46.657 --> 01:48.892
<i>So we come into the lab,</i>

01:48.926 --> 01:52.128
<i>and there's all kinds
of glasses and chemicals,</i>

01:52.163 --> 01:53.296
and it looks like

01:53.331 --> 01:55.231
<i>a mad scientist
was in a crazy mood.</i>

01:55.266 --> 01:57.133
What the hell now?

01:57.168 --> 01:58.535
I like crazy.

01:58.569 --> 02:01.338
Science...
I like that.

02:01.372 --> 02:02.339
Hey, guys,

02:02.373 --> 02:03.573
you ready to find out

02:03.607 --> 02:05.608
about your next
Spotlight Challenge?

02:05.643 --> 02:06.609
All: Yes.

02:06.644 --> 02:07.911
Let's get to it.

02:08.245 --> 02:10.747
So films like Aliens, The Thing,

02:10.781 --> 02:13.116
<i>and Invasion
of the Body Snatchers,</i>

02:13.150 --> 02:15.652
introduced audiences
to parasitic aliens

02:15.686 --> 02:17.253
that feed off of

02:17.288 --> 02:19.322
and burst
out of their human hosts.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.657
This chilling combination

02:20.691 --> 02:23.660
of horror and sci-fi
is at the core

02:23.694 --> 02:24.927
of this week's challenge.

02:24.962 --> 02:26.829
That's awesome.

02:26.864 --> 02:29.432
Now, behind me
are five microscopes,

02:29.466 --> 02:33.336
each one with a different
real-world microorganism.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.171
Working in teams of two,

02:35.205 --> 02:37.173
your Spotlight Challenge
is to choose one of them

02:37.207 --> 02:38.675
and use it as inspiration

02:38.709 --> 02:41.678
for your very own alien entity

02:41.712 --> 02:43.446
that is bursting
out of its host.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.514
Yes.

02:44.548 --> 02:46.182
I have an obsession with aliens,

02:46.216 --> 02:48.551
<i>so I'm really excited
about this.</i>

02:48.585 --> 02:51.054
Everyone, pick a teammate
and go stand next to them.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.256
- Kaleb?
- Yes.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.959
Go, team Mel!
[chuckling]

02:56.994 --> 03:00.063
All right, it's time
to choose your microorganisms.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.664
Mel and Melissa, you're first.

03:01.699 --> 03:02.832
Please be good.

03:02.866 --> 03:04.400
- Ooh!
- Nice.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.637
- Oh, nice!
- Yes!

03:07.671 --> 03:09.539
Eenie, meenie, miny, mo.

03:09.573 --> 03:11.174
- Yeah.
- All right.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.242
Ooh!

03:13.277 --> 03:14.510
- We can do that.
- That's a good one.

03:14.545 --> 03:16.879
All right,
I brought in an expert

03:16.914 --> 03:18.614
to help advise you this week.

03:18.649 --> 03:22.218
He has starred
in over 150 films,

03:22.252 --> 03:23.986
including Pumpkinhead,

03:24.021 --> 03:26.255
The Terminator, and Aliens.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.491
Please welcome Bishop himself,

03:28.525 --> 03:30.393
Lance Henriksen.

03:30.427 --> 03:31.561
What?

03:33.364 --> 03:34.564
Oh, my God!

03:34.598 --> 03:36.399
<i>Aliens is one
of my favorite films.</i>

03:36.433 --> 03:38.735
I'm just like,
"Aah! I get to see him!"

03:38.769 --> 03:40.970
Thank you so much
for being here.

03:41.004 --> 03:42.472
- Thank you.
- It's an honor.

03:42.506 --> 03:44.107
Thank you.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.876
All right, so you know
this world extremely well.

03:46.910 --> 03:49.078
What do you think makes these
types of aliens so terrifying?

03:49.113 --> 03:50.580
Like a jack-in-the-box,

03:50.614 --> 03:52.682
the anticipation
of it popping up

03:52.716 --> 03:55.385
is what people got
excited about.

03:55.419 --> 03:56.953
It's so true.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.721
So how can these guys
capture that fear

03:58.756 --> 04:00.656
in their makeups?

04:00.691 --> 04:04.761
To really create fear
and stuff that's legitimate,

04:04.795 --> 04:06.629
it has to come
from your life experiences.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.730
Use that in your work.

04:07.765 --> 04:08.831
All right, guys,

04:08.866 --> 04:10.500
it's time to get working
on your designs.

04:10.534 --> 04:11.834
I'll be by later on with my dad

04:11.869 --> 04:13.202
to check in
and see how you're doing.

04:13.237 --> 04:14.203
Good luck.

04:14.238 --> 04:15.538
All:
Thank you.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.445
There's just so much
cool stuff happening

04:22.479 --> 04:23.846
- in this parasite.
- I know.

04:23.881 --> 04:26.849
<i>Our microorganism</i>

04:26.884 --> 04:30.353
is <i> Lepidonotopodium piscesae.</i>

04:30.387 --> 04:33.956
<i>It looks frightening,
so we want it to be gruesome.</i>

04:33.991 --> 04:37.226
This parasite is kind of
starting to, like,

04:37.261 --> 04:38.428
bust out of this skin.

04:38.462 --> 04:41.097
We decide that
our alien microorganism

04:41.131 --> 04:44.300
will take over its host,
but we want our alien

04:44.334 --> 04:46.369
to be bursting
out of one side of the face.

04:46.403 --> 04:47.970
This is exactly
what I was thinking.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.842
This thing is very wormy.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.444
I've worked with Robert
once before,

04:54.478 --> 04:56.913
<i>and I'm a little hesitant
this time around.</i>

04:56.947 --> 04:59.315
No, no, don't paint
any more of that.

04:59.349 --> 05:00.883
I'm worried that
we're going to butt heads.

05:00.918 --> 05:03.252
I think this thing
is starting to grow

05:03.287 --> 05:05.288
like a tumor
growing on her head.

05:05.322 --> 05:07.957
Our microorganism
is a <i> Taenia taeniaeformis.</i>

05:07.991 --> 05:10.359
<i>It's got little tentacles,
and it's wormlike.</i>

05:10.394 --> 05:14.130
We are doing a food-poisoning
infestation story.

05:14.164 --> 05:17.533
<i>The host develops tumorlike
formations on their skull,</i>

05:17.568 --> 05:19.902
<i>and eventually
the worms explode out</i>

05:19.937 --> 05:22.438
in slimy, bloody glory.

05:22.473 --> 05:24.774
That'll look pretty cool
and sets us apart

05:24.808 --> 05:26.042
from anyone else.

05:28.879 --> 05:30.780
I want it to seem like
it grew inside of him,

05:30.814 --> 05:32.548
and then it's bursting out
at several places.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.050
So, if the head is
in the back of the head...

05:34.084 --> 05:36.819
Our microorganism
is <i> Nereis sandersi.</i>

05:36.854 --> 05:39.822
<i>Lance Henriksen tells us
that what's scary about it</i>

05:39.857 --> 05:42.225
<i>is the anticipation
leading up to that moment</i>

05:42.259 --> 05:43.459
<i>where you see the alien.</i>

05:43.494 --> 05:44.994
<i>So we decide we want the alien</i>

05:45.028 --> 05:46.629
<i>to be bursting out
the back of the head,</i>

05:46.663 --> 05:48.965
so you only see it
once he turns around.

05:48.999 --> 05:51.267
That's really cool.
I like that idea.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.571
Hey, guys!
I need you to stop working.

05:55.606 --> 05:56.572
Oh, my goodness.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.307
Come gather on up
over here with us.

05:58.342 --> 06:00.843
McKenzie,
what are you doing to me?

06:00.878 --> 06:02.578
<i>McKenzie and Lance
come back out,</i>

06:02.613 --> 06:04.280
but Mr. Westmore
isn't with her.

06:04.314 --> 06:05.581
We're like, "What's going on?

06:05.616 --> 06:07.383
This is just
really fucking scary."

06:09.186 --> 06:11.254
All right,
so there's another element

06:11.288 --> 06:14.156
of this challenge
that we haven't told you about.

06:14.191 --> 06:15.625
[sighs]

06:15.659 --> 06:17.894
Lance, what is the one thing

06:17.928 --> 06:20.763
that every good
alien makeup needs?

06:20.797 --> 06:21.964
Slime.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.165
[laughter]

06:23.200 --> 06:24.834
That's right...
slime.

06:24.868 --> 06:29.705
All of your final creations
must have some kind of slime,

06:29.740 --> 06:32.174
but we need to see
the goods right now.

06:32.209 --> 06:33.776
All: What?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.478
What is happening?

06:35.512 --> 06:37.780
Your first Foundation Challenge

06:37.814 --> 06:39.749
starts now.

06:39.783 --> 06:41.150
Oh, no.

06:41.184 --> 06:42.752
I'm a little nervous,
but I'm ready to get messy

06:42.786 --> 06:45.221
and really bring this home
to our design.

06:46.456 --> 06:49.759
You'll have two hours
to create custom slime

06:49.793 --> 06:51.160
for your alien creations.

06:51.194 --> 06:53.963
When time is up,
we're gonna test it out.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.798
So, Lance, what are you
gonna be looking for?

06:55.832 --> 06:58.734
I'm looking at texture, color,

06:58.769 --> 07:01.237
and does it work in the way
you intended it to?

07:01.271 --> 07:02.538
Before we begin,

07:02.573 --> 07:05.074
let's see what materials
you'll be working with.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.982
[contestants murmuring]

07:13.016 --> 07:14.750
Oh, my God.

07:14.785 --> 07:16.152
I need my apron.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.587
Well, as you can see,

07:17.621 --> 07:19.655
you have a little bit
of everything here for you.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.290
Now, before we begin,

07:21.325 --> 07:24.193
I'm sure you're assuming
that immunity is on the line.

07:24.227 --> 07:25.728
All: Yes.

07:25.762 --> 07:28.764
It is,
but for the first time ever,

07:28.799 --> 07:31.968
the winning team
will win immunity.

07:32.002 --> 07:33.135
That's awesome.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.704
<i>We want this really bad,</i>

07:34.738 --> 07:36.172
but there's only five teams.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.274
<i>So, if one team is already safe,</i>

07:38.308 --> 07:39.575
you really
have to do a good job.

07:39.610 --> 07:41.010
All right, well,
let's make some slime.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.778
On Lance's "go," I want you

07:42.813 --> 07:44.914
to grab your supplies
and get started.

07:44.948 --> 07:48.451
On your mark, get set, go!

07:55.959 --> 07:57.627
I will follow your lead here.

07:57.661 --> 07:59.595
Oh, I wish you wouldn't.

07:59.630 --> 08:00.963
I've never made slime before,

08:00.998 --> 08:02.898
<i>so I hope Mel
knows how to make slime.</i>

08:02.933 --> 08:04.166
[laughs]

08:04.201 --> 08:06.402
All right, so this definitely
goops up quickly.

08:06.436 --> 08:08.437
We get this
cool-looking nematode.

08:08.472 --> 08:09.905
<i>So our concept is</i>

08:09.940 --> 08:12.274
<i>the alien is bursting
out of the model's head,</i>

08:12.309 --> 08:14.944
<i>and then she'll have
this flayed skin</i>

08:14.978 --> 08:18.447
that was formerly her face,
resting on her shoulders.

08:19.683 --> 08:21.283
<i>Melissa and I want the slime</i>

08:21.318 --> 08:22.785
to have that...
[groans]

08:22.819 --> 08:24.654
<i>Sticky, gooey quality.</i>

08:24.688 --> 08:27.823
<i>So I'm grabbing
cornstarch and glycerin</i>

08:27.858 --> 08:29.425
'cause we have no idea
what we're doing.

08:29.459 --> 08:31.627
I'm trying to make it
less liquid, I feel like.

08:31.662 --> 08:33.261
That one's pretty nice.

08:33.296 --> 08:35.631
I stumble upon
the magic ingredient,

08:35.666 --> 08:37.799
which is veterinary lube.

08:37.833 --> 08:41.303
It creates that snap-back
that we've been looking for.

08:41.337 --> 08:43.405
Science. What...
Oh, that's nice.

08:47.244 --> 08:49.545
This mixture creates
like, boogers.

08:49.579 --> 08:50.980
Johnny and I get the tardigrade.

08:51.014 --> 08:54.183
<i>We want the host
shedding the human skin,</i>

08:54.217 --> 08:55.851
<i>and this alien organism</i>

08:55.886 --> 08:58.754
<i>will also be bursting
from the chest,</i>

08:58.789 --> 09:00.790
<i>and the slime will be shooting
from the chest.</i>

09:00.824 --> 09:02.458
That's cool.

09:02.492 --> 09:05.094
The laundry detergent has
some kind of chemical property

09:05.128 --> 09:08.798
that's making it form all of
these, like, gelatinous blobs.

09:08.832 --> 09:12.368
To add a little bit of texture,
I add some flocking to it.

09:12.402 --> 09:15.104
<i>Flocking is,
like, little fibers.</i>

09:15.138 --> 09:17.073
I think this is, like,
the best idea anyone's ever had,

09:17.107 --> 09:19.341
so I'm making sure
that nobody's looking

09:19.376 --> 09:21.243
and ditch the evidence
immediately.

09:21.278 --> 09:22.812
[hums]

09:22.846 --> 09:26.348
I think with my idea,
we might take this one.

09:32.355 --> 09:34.190
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

09:35.525 --> 09:37.593
<i>Our concept is disgusting.</i>

09:37.627 --> 09:40.296
<i>So Rob and I know
that we want our slime</i>

09:40.330 --> 09:42.465
to be mucus-y and chunky.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.400
<i>So I start with applesauce.</i>

09:44.434 --> 09:47.403
<i>Then I put cornstarch in it
to make it thicker.</i>

09:47.437 --> 09:51.841
I think I want
a little more yellowy-green.

09:51.875 --> 09:55.845
And it turns
into this nasty, snotty,

09:55.879 --> 09:59.749
<i>gross, chunky stuff,
and I'm like, "Perfect."</i>

09:59.783 --> 10:01.817
Mmm.

10:05.122 --> 10:07.523
Oh, that's good.
I like that.

10:07.557 --> 10:09.558
Our slime
is a corn-syrup base.

10:09.593 --> 10:11.827
<i>It's runny but stringy.</i>

10:11.862 --> 10:13.763
It's right in line
with our concept.

10:13.797 --> 10:14.864
Highlighters are good,

10:14.898 --> 10:16.532
'cause you can soak the
highlighters in it

10:16.566 --> 10:18.067
- and make them...
- Make them shiny?

10:18.101 --> 10:19.068
Yeah.

10:19.102 --> 10:20.469
I want a bright slime

10:20.504 --> 10:22.204
<i>because it'll catch the light</i>

10:22.239 --> 10:25.541
and look awesome
and nasty and gooey.

10:25.575 --> 10:27.209
Gross, but I love it.

10:30.747 --> 10:33.048
I think it's,
like, booger-y.

10:33.083 --> 10:36.986
Anna and I do a test batch
of detergent, a corn syrup,

10:37.020 --> 10:38.954
<i>glycerin, and a lot of give.</i>

10:38.989 --> 10:39.989
Look at that.

10:40.023 --> 10:42.291
<i>But it's still too watery,</i>

10:42.325 --> 10:44.293
<i>and we want
a slow-moving slime</i>

10:44.327 --> 10:46.428
<i>because it's not stringy
coming out.</i>

10:46.463 --> 10:47.763
It's more of a vomit.

10:47.798 --> 10:49.765
We'll just keep playing with it
until it gets there.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.234
We just keep on adding
more methylcellulose,

10:52.269 --> 10:53.769
<i>more glycerin.</i>

10:53.804 --> 10:56.639
We're hoping that with
a little bit of time to settle,

10:56.673 --> 10:57.640
<i>it'll come around.</i>

10:57.674 --> 10:59.041
Ten minutes!

11:10.453 --> 11:11.520
Time's up!

11:11.555 --> 11:13.088
Let's test some slime.

11:14.558 --> 11:16.325
Ah, that's so gross.

11:16.359 --> 11:18.527
All right,
ready to try out your slime?

11:18.562 --> 11:20.162
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Have at it.

11:20.197 --> 11:21.463
Three!

11:21.498 --> 11:23.432
[laughter]

11:23.466 --> 11:25.067
- There we go.
- Oh, yeah.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.669
- Oh!
- Yeah.

11:26.703 --> 11:28.070
It's got some strength too.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.238
Really cool.

11:31.374 --> 11:33.275
- Look at that.
- Yeah, look at the stretch.

11:33.310 --> 11:35.444
Look at the stretch
of this thing.

11:35.478 --> 11:37.980
Wow. Oh!

11:38.014 --> 11:39.949
That's good stuff.
Good work.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.252
[both laughing]

11:43.286 --> 11:45.387
There, that's better.

11:45.422 --> 11:46.755
[all cheering]

11:46.790 --> 11:48.357
Yay!

11:48.391 --> 11:50.926
All: Oh!

11:50.961 --> 11:52.461
Oh, my God.

11:52.495 --> 11:53.796
Yeah!

11:53.830 --> 11:55.264
Do you want gloves?

11:55.298 --> 11:57.633
Yeah.

11:57.667 --> 12:00.236
No, I didn't.
I didn't. It's still there.

12:00.270 --> 12:03.439
[laughter]

12:03.473 --> 12:04.740
All right, Lance,

12:04.774 --> 12:06.942
so which teams made
the best slime today?

12:06.977 --> 12:08.310
This is really hard

12:08.345 --> 12:09.778
'cause you all did
such a great job,

12:09.813 --> 12:11.347
but I'll say Johnny and Walter.

12:11.381 --> 12:12.481
I love what you did.

12:12.515 --> 12:14.383
You mastered the chunk.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.685
Usually, the stuff
is so thinned out,

12:16.720 --> 12:19.989
so it has a use that
I haven't quite seen before.

12:20.023 --> 12:22.191
Mel and Melissa,
it was beautiful.

12:22.225 --> 12:24.960
It could be either very sinister
and catch the light,

12:24.995 --> 12:27.363
or it could be very childlike.

12:27.397 --> 12:29.031
Really quite wonderful.

12:29.065 --> 12:30.866
All right, well, it is time
to crown a winning team,

12:30.901 --> 12:32.201
so who is it, Lance?

12:32.235 --> 12:33.802
The winning team is...

12:41.725 --> 12:43.893
Alright, well it is time to
crown a winning team.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.461
So who is it, Lance?

12:45.529 --> 12:49.064
The winning team is...

12:50.180 --> 12:51.400
Mel and Melissa.

12:51.468 --> 12:53.903
[applause]

12:53.970 --> 12:56.639
I could see this in a film
so easily with the lighting.

12:56.706 --> 12:58.274
So I'm really happy for you.

12:58.341 --> 12:59.475
You've created
something wonderful.

12:59.543 --> 13:00.743
Both:
Thank you.

13:00.811 --> 13:04.180
I could not be more grateful
for the immunity.

13:04.247 --> 13:07.850
Sometimes having fun
really does pay off.

13:07.918 --> 13:09.418
Mel and Melissa,
congratulations.

13:09.486 --> 13:11.554
Neither of you can be eliminated

13:11.621 --> 13:13.122
in this week's
Spotlight Challenge.

13:13.190 --> 13:15.524
So, Lance, thank you so much
for being here with us today.

13:15.592 --> 13:17.560
- This was so much fun.
- Thank you. Thank you.

13:17.627 --> 13:18.994
I had a great time.

13:19.062 --> 13:21.130
All right, guys,
it's time to get back to work

13:21.198 --> 13:22.531
on your Spotlight Challenge.

13:22.599 --> 13:23.532
Good luck.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.401
Bye.
Thank you.

13:28.471 --> 13:29.672
It's time to get to work,

13:29.739 --> 13:31.207
and Anna's gonna
sculpt the face,

13:31.274 --> 13:34.009
<i>and I'm gonna sculpt the cowl.</i>

13:34.077 --> 13:36.245
<i>I'm taking reference
from the organism</i>

13:36.313 --> 13:37.479
<i>to add to my cowl,</i>

13:37.547 --> 13:39.215
<i>and I want to bring it
all the way across,</i>

13:39.282 --> 13:40.983
<i>adding the horns and the folds.</i>

13:41.051 --> 13:43.919
<i>Our angle is to really
scare the judges.</i>

13:43.987 --> 13:45.254
<i>We want to be scared by it.</i>

13:45.322 --> 13:47.156
We want everybody
to be scared by it.

13:47.224 --> 13:49.058
It looks awesome.
I love it.

13:53.263 --> 13:55.831
So this side, jaw, is hard.

13:55.899 --> 13:57.366
- Does that work?
- Yeah.

13:57.434 --> 13:58.500
While Rob is doing the cowl,

13:58.568 --> 14:00.569
<i>I want to get my shoulder piece</i>

14:00.637 --> 14:03.138
completely sculpted
and start the arm appliance.

14:05.141 --> 14:07.009
<i>For the shoulder piece,
I want it to look</i>

14:07.077 --> 14:10.913
<i>like the tentacles are moving
in and out of the body</i>

14:10.981 --> 14:13.816
with bigger ones and
smaller ones just bursting out.

14:13.884 --> 14:16.018
- So these are here?
- Like this.

14:16.086 --> 14:18.754
- Like, in one big thing.
- Okay.

14:28.164 --> 14:30.165
Hey, guys,
here to check in on you.

14:30.233 --> 14:31.433
Hi.

14:31.501 --> 14:32.768
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

14:32.836 --> 14:34.703
All right, so you have immunity,

14:34.771 --> 14:36.005
so you're pretty much
on your own.

14:36.072 --> 14:37.239
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

14:37.307 --> 14:39.041
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

14:39.109 --> 14:40.643
Kidding.
Kidding, kidding.

14:40.710 --> 14:41.944
[laughing]

14:42.012 --> 14:45.814
All right, so tell us
about your microorganism

14:45.882 --> 14:47.082
that's bursting out of its host.

14:47.150 --> 14:49.084
<i>So I'm sculpting the face,</i>

14:49.152 --> 14:50.686
<i>and she's sculpting the cowl.</i>

14:50.754 --> 14:52.922
Right now I'm feeling
very unhappy with the face.

14:52.989 --> 14:54.323
I think the first thing
you need to do is change this.

14:54.391 --> 14:55.925
They don't have
to be the same height.

14:55.992 --> 14:57.293
I wouldn't break it open

14:57.360 --> 14:59.428
right down the middle
of the nose like that.

14:59.496 --> 15:02.665
It could also be opened up,
I think, a little bit more.

15:02.732 --> 15:04.066
It's got a long way to go.

15:04.134 --> 15:05.734
Yeah, you need to make
it look like this thing

15:05.802 --> 15:07.703
is really forcing its way out

15:07.771 --> 15:08.704
through the face.

15:08.772 --> 15:10.372
Tell us what you got going on.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.308
- Alien worms.
- All right.

15:12.375 --> 15:15.444
So he's causing tumors
building in her...

15:15.512 --> 15:17.313
- Mm-hmm, right.
- head.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.448
I want to incorporate
that bloody-pustule,

15:19.516 --> 15:21.183
tumor look to them.

15:21.251 --> 15:22.618
You don't really need
to do most of them.

15:22.686 --> 15:23.986
Don't overdo it.

15:24.054 --> 15:25.187
Be selective with it,
instead of just doing...

15:25.255 --> 15:26.221
- Just a few, then?
- Yeah.

15:26.289 --> 15:27.222
Kind of break it up.

15:27.290 --> 15:28.390
- Got ya.
- Yep. Yep.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.392
The face of the parasite
will be popping

15:30.460 --> 15:31.827
out of the
back of the head here,

15:31.895 --> 15:33.462
<i>and then his tentacles
will be underneath his skin.</i>

15:33.530 --> 15:36.031
You know, any place you start
putting rips in the skin,

15:36.099 --> 15:37.700
you've got to make it
a little bit more flipped,

15:37.767 --> 15:41.036
maybe raised around the edges
so it looks like it's stretching

15:41.104 --> 15:43.305
that's going on
as it's going into the head.

15:43.373 --> 15:44.306
Okay.

15:44.374 --> 15:45.607
We wanted to go

15:45.675 --> 15:48.544
<i>with a pretty classic
chest-bursting monster.</i>

15:48.611 --> 15:52.514
We can spin it
with a drill motor.

15:52.582 --> 15:53.649
He's thinking
of doing a little bit

15:53.717 --> 15:55.017
of a gore makeup around it.

15:55.085 --> 15:56.552
Well, if you're gonna do that,
then you ought to take

15:56.619 --> 15:58.420
and actually put
some skin around that.

15:58.488 --> 16:00.289
Otherwise it's gonna look
like a piece that's just put...

16:00.357 --> 16:02.458
Especially if the costume
moves or something.

16:02.525 --> 16:03.459
Sure.

16:03.526 --> 16:04.827
I was a little concerned

16:04.894 --> 16:06.762
with how I'm gonna
make it transition

16:06.830 --> 16:08.897
<i>from the lip into broken skin.</i>

16:08.965 --> 16:11.300
You need to be
bursting out of here.

16:11.368 --> 16:12.968
Right now it doesn't look
like it's bursting out.

16:13.036 --> 16:14.970
It looks like a mouth, and
she's going like this, you know?

16:15.038 --> 16:16.638
I think you're just
gonna have to take

16:16.706 --> 16:19.641
and pull that up and give
yourself that torn skin.

16:19.709 --> 16:20.843
Okay.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.511
Bury it right over
the lower lip and around there.

16:22.579 --> 16:23.679
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:23.747 --> 16:25.014
All right, guys,
we're heading out.

16:25.081 --> 16:27.416
- Can't wait to see these.
- Good luck to everybody.

16:27.484 --> 16:28.784
- Good luck.
all: - Thank you.

16:35.025 --> 16:36.125
It's just frustrating

16:36.192 --> 16:37.493
'cause I've started over
three times.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.827
I know.

16:38.895 --> 16:40.696
As the day goes on,
I'm still hating the face.

16:40.764 --> 16:41.864
<i>I know that we have immunity,</i>

16:41.931 --> 16:43.532
but I don't want to put out
anything

16:43.600 --> 16:45.567
that I'm gonna be
embarrassed by,

16:45.635 --> 16:48.570
and what's happening now,
I feel terrible about.

16:48.638 --> 16:50.439
I hate it so much.

16:50.507 --> 16:53.475
Like, it doesn't
look like our thing.

16:53.543 --> 16:55.077
Should I just take this off
really quick?

16:55.145 --> 16:56.111
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.

16:56.179 --> 16:58.247
I feel, like, very stressed out.

16:58.314 --> 17:00.949
I feel like my hands are broken,
like I'm...

17:01.017 --> 17:02.217
What's wrong with you?

17:02.285 --> 17:04.353
Fourth time's the charm.

17:04.421 --> 17:06.555
I'm just trying to
build up, like,

17:06.623 --> 17:08.190
where it's gonna start.

17:08.258 --> 17:10.125
I decide to go more

17:10.193 --> 17:12.194
<i>for a sense of inspiration
from the microorganism,</i>

17:12.262 --> 17:14.329
<i>rather than literally
replicating it,</i>

17:14.396 --> 17:17.733
<i>and now I'm finally feeling
like I have a direction.</i>

17:17.800 --> 17:19.268
So that's looking better,
I think.

17:19.335 --> 17:21.203
I think right now
it's looking a lot better.

17:22.405 --> 17:24.306
That is time, everyone!

17:24.374 --> 17:27.643
Man, I totally checked my ego

17:27.710 --> 17:30.012
about being like,
"We don't need the immunity."

17:30.080 --> 17:32.081
<i>I finally have a direction
I'm happy with,</i>

17:32.148 --> 17:33.816
and time's up.

17:33.883 --> 17:34.950
It didn't feel very close.

17:35.018 --> 17:37.686
<i>Today feels like a huge waste,</i>

17:37.754 --> 17:40.289
but I'm excited
that I can come in tomorrow

17:40.356 --> 17:43.392
<i>and get this done and just be
done with this face.</i>

17:51.968 --> 17:53.769
Yeah!
We got this.

17:53.837 --> 17:56.572
<i>Mel and I
have a lot to do today.</i>

17:56.639 --> 17:58.140
We need to finish
both of our sculptures,

17:58.208 --> 17:59.808
and then we need
to mold everything.

17:59.876 --> 18:02.344
I feel like I was, like,
so in my own head yesterday.

18:02.412 --> 18:03.512
I'm, like, looking at yours now,

18:03.580 --> 18:05.414
like,
"This looks really cool."

18:05.482 --> 18:06.782
I'm glad you approve.

18:06.850 --> 18:08.750
At this point,
all I really need to do

18:08.818 --> 18:10.419
<i>is finish some basic forms
in the face,</i>

18:10.487 --> 18:12.254
<i>and then add all the texture,</i>

18:12.322 --> 18:16.592
<i>'cause texture's what's gonna
sell this as a real organism.</i>

18:18.661 --> 18:22.097
<i>While Katie
is doing one big cowl,</i>

18:22.165 --> 18:25.434
<i>I will just concentrate
on the alien and make, like,</i>

18:25.502 --> 18:28.904
a pretty cool-looking
worm/alien thingy.

18:28.972 --> 18:30.539
It's not easy
being a brain worm.

18:30.607 --> 18:35.477
It just eats people's brains
because of rejection.

18:35.545 --> 18:38.614
Hans likes to burrow
into peoples' brains.

18:38.681 --> 18:41.049
<i>He's not particularly
a bad worm,</i>

18:41.117 --> 18:42.484
but it's just his nature.

18:42.552 --> 18:44.520
He just wants love, you know?
Revenge.

18:44.587 --> 18:46.588
- Oh, he's eating his feelings?
- Yeah.

18:46.656 --> 18:48.557
♪ Hans the brain worm ♪

18:48.625 --> 18:50.826
♪ First he eats your brain ♪

18:50.894 --> 18:54.229
♪ Then you go insane ♪

18:54.297 --> 18:56.665
I just came up with that.

18:59.669 --> 19:03.672
I go over and check
on my poly foam chest piece.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.908
<i>I open the mold,
and it doesn't work.</i>

19:05.975 --> 19:07.309
<i>It didn't really fill.</i>

19:07.377 --> 19:09.444
<i>There was nothing
remotely usable,</i>

19:09.512 --> 19:10.746
which is extremely frustrating.

19:10.813 --> 19:11.747
Here's what we got.

19:11.814 --> 19:14.249
That didn't expand at all.
Wow.

19:14.317 --> 19:16.451
Yeah.

19:16.519 --> 19:18.720
What I thought was gonna work
isn't working,

19:18.788 --> 19:20.189
and it's kind of
a big part of the makeup.

19:20.256 --> 19:22.591
<i>The challenge was
a bursting creature,</i>

19:22.659 --> 19:23.926
<i>which we don't have right now.</i>

19:23.993 --> 19:25.527
And now we have to start over.

19:34.267 --> 19:36.234
<i>I open the mold,
and it doesn't work.</i>

19:36.269 --> 19:37.936
<i>We didn't use enough poly foam,</i>

19:37.970 --> 19:39.504
and now we have to start over.

19:39.539 --> 19:42.407
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:42.441 --> 19:43.942
I know there's a lot to do,

19:43.976 --> 19:45.610
<i>and I feel like
I'm letting Walter down,</i>

19:45.645 --> 19:47.012
<i>and I'm disappointed,</i>

19:47.046 --> 19:48.280
and so
I'm going to make it work.

19:48.314 --> 19:49.915
<i>The first try was a waste,</i>

19:49.949 --> 19:52.117
<i>so we need to do it
all over again,</i>

19:52.151 --> 19:54.286
and this time
we tripled the amount

19:54.320 --> 19:56.588
of self-skinning poly foam
that we're going to be using,

19:56.622 --> 19:58.790
<i>and hopefully that's enough
to get what we need.</i>

20:03.629 --> 20:05.830
Look at you in here all fancy.

20:05.865 --> 20:07.732
Mm-hmm.
Now I'm freaking out.

20:07.767 --> 20:08.934
Why?

20:08.968 --> 20:10.268
'Cause I'm running out of time.

20:10.303 --> 20:11.703
I'm feeling
a little overwhelmed.

20:11.737 --> 20:13.338
I really like the way it looks,

20:13.372 --> 20:16.007
but if I don't get it molded,
then it doesn't really matter.

20:16.042 --> 20:17.842
I just decide...
got to mold it.

20:17.877 --> 20:19.611
<i>So I immediately go into</i>

20:19.645 --> 20:23.148
"super-fast rushing
to get this mold done" mode.

20:23.182 --> 20:24.249
What's up?

20:24.283 --> 20:27.886
I just took my
sweet-ass time, didn't I?

20:27.920 --> 20:29.554
I'm just mad at myself.

20:29.589 --> 20:31.623
Here, come use this area.

20:31.657 --> 20:33.592
Hopefully nothing goes wrong.

20:33.626 --> 20:35.160
I'm getting claustrophobic
'cause I'm so stressed.

20:35.194 --> 20:36.494
I don't want to crowd
into a corner.

20:36.529 --> 20:37.562
Oh.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.602
This is only
the second cowl I've ever molded

20:43.636 --> 20:45.670
and the only cowl
I've ever molded alone.

20:45.705 --> 20:49.140
<i>So I've mixed up enough plaster
for both sides at a time,</i>

20:49.175 --> 20:50.442
and it goes super fast.

20:50.476 --> 20:52.277
<i>This mold needs to
turn out perfect</i>

20:52.311 --> 20:55.447
<i>so my sculpture, which I'm
in love with now, comes out,</i>

20:55.481 --> 20:57.248
and I really don't want to
mess it up

20:57.283 --> 20:59.184
'cause that would totally
ruin everything.

20:59.218 --> 21:00.185
We're all so quiet.

21:00.219 --> 21:02.887
We're all focused.

21:05.958 --> 21:07.759
- Help me.
- Okay.

21:07.793 --> 21:11.329
Yvonne and I start working
on our slime.

21:11.364 --> 21:13.765
<i>We decide to not go
with our slime</i>

21:13.799 --> 21:15.233
<i>from the Foundation Challenge.</i>

21:15.267 --> 21:17.035
<i>We didn't really like the way
it turned out.</i>

21:17.069 --> 21:19.237
<i>So we find
some caramel food coloring.</i>

21:19.271 --> 21:22.607
It looks disgusting,
which is exactly what we wanted.

21:22.642 --> 21:25.577
<i>We're going to use it
all over our alien</i>

21:25.611 --> 21:28.079
<i>and for the drool
coming out of our host's mouth.</i>

21:28.114 --> 21:29.648
Yes.

21:29.682 --> 21:32.450
Mmm.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.421
Yeah, I wouldn't want that
bursting out of my chest

21:36.455 --> 21:37.822
or anywhere for that matter.

21:37.857 --> 21:40.392
[chuckling]

21:44.597 --> 21:45.930
That's it, people!

21:45.965 --> 21:48.533
Zero minutes left!

21:48.567 --> 21:50.568
<i>I am so relieved today is over.</i>

21:50.603 --> 21:53.838
We got a lot done,
but it was so stressful.

21:53.873 --> 21:56.775
<i>All is well, but tomorrow
I'm really gonna have</i>

21:56.809 --> 22:00.512
to manage my time well
and paint like a madman.

22:00.546 --> 22:03.448
You're gonna leave me
hanging this whole time?

22:16.362 --> 22:18.296
How are those beautiful edges?

22:18.330 --> 22:19.764
- Oh, yes.
- Pretty good.

22:19.799 --> 22:21.366
I'm gonna make today my bitch.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.669
We need to get the cowl on,
face piece on,

22:24.704 --> 22:27.272
<i>attach the monster to the chest</i>

22:27.306 --> 22:28.606
and paint the whole thing.

22:28.641 --> 22:31.109
Yeah, I like that.

22:31.143 --> 22:32.210
Where's Hans?

22:32.244 --> 22:34.212
I want to get these out.

22:34.246 --> 22:35.714
All right.
Meh, meh.

22:35.748 --> 22:37.048
This is gonna look so scary.

22:37.083 --> 22:40.251
Here's the models.

22:40.286 --> 22:41.853
I'm Mel.

22:41.887 --> 22:43.621
Kaleb.
Nice to finally meet you.

22:43.656 --> 22:45.657
This is Hans the brain worm.

22:45.691 --> 22:47.592
He's gonna come
out of your head.

22:47.626 --> 22:49.527
I'm starting
to paint this guy now.

22:49.562 --> 22:50.929
Okay.

22:50.963 --> 22:52.397
We need to finish
pre-painting first.

22:52.431 --> 22:55.533
<i>So I focus on getting
all the vein work</i>

22:55.568 --> 22:56.568
<i>applied to the cowl.</i>

22:56.602 --> 22:58.002
And I'm really liking this.

22:58.037 --> 23:00.171
- More.
- More?

23:00.206 --> 23:01.573
Okay, thank you.

23:01.607 --> 23:03.842
<i>I brush five-minute epoxy
right onto the beak.</i>

23:03.876 --> 23:06.010
It gives it
that shiny, wet look,

23:06.045 --> 23:07.545
<i>but it also makes it harder,</i>

23:07.580 --> 23:11.316
<i>so it actually is looking
like our organism's mouth.</i>

23:11.350 --> 23:13.084
<i>It's time to get
these pieces on him,</i>

23:13.119 --> 23:14.452
start bringing our character
to life.

23:14.487 --> 23:17.021
I'm just gonna finish
up the last of this,

23:17.056 --> 23:18.490
and then we'll apply.

23:18.524 --> 23:21.292
- Sound good?
- Perfect.

23:21.327 --> 23:23.294
I don't know if the shoulders
should blend onto the cowl

23:23.329 --> 23:24.696
or the cowl onto the shoulder.

23:24.730 --> 23:26.931
<i>Kaleb and I need to apply</i>

23:26.966 --> 23:29.000
<i>as many prosthetics as we can</i>

23:29.034 --> 23:31.302
and then paint everything
all at once.

23:31.337 --> 23:33.571
<i>We have a lot to do, but
it's definitely not impossible</i>

23:33.606 --> 23:34.572
to get it all done.

23:34.607 --> 23:35.707
Oh, that's foul as hell.

23:35.741 --> 23:37.142
- That's disgusting.
- I love it.

23:43.449 --> 23:44.682
I want to get this thing made,

23:44.717 --> 23:46.050
get it on,
get it working, like, now.

23:46.085 --> 23:48.453
I'm worried about time
at this point.

23:48.487 --> 23:50.722
<i>We need to put
this monster together.</i>

23:50.756 --> 23:51.856
All right, hit it.

23:51.891 --> 23:53.458
<i>After we get
the chest rigged up,</i>

23:53.492 --> 23:55.593
<i>we test the drill,
we see that it's working.</i>

23:55.628 --> 23:57.061
<i>The makeup is coming together,</i>

23:57.096 --> 23:58.530
<i>and I think the blood spray</i>

23:58.564 --> 24:00.732
and the initial shock
that it's gonna cause

24:00.766 --> 24:03.601
<i>will show the judges
that we're really going for it.</i>

24:03.636 --> 24:04.636
Yeah.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.204
Cool.

24:09.742 --> 24:10.742
You okay with what's happening

24:10.776 --> 24:11.876
- with the paint job?
- Yeah.

24:11.911 --> 24:12.977
I still haven't
added the yellow.

24:13.012 --> 24:14.078
The yellow's
gonna lighten it up.

24:14.113 --> 24:15.747
We basically have
two separate paint jobs.

24:15.781 --> 24:17.148
So she's painting
around the face.

24:17.183 --> 24:18.383
I'm painting around the cowl,

24:18.417 --> 24:20.685
and we're just circling
our poor model,

24:20.719 --> 24:21.786
but it looks great.

24:21.821 --> 24:24.122
Oh, that's so horrifying.

24:24.156 --> 24:25.623
<i>Next, I lay hair on the head,</i>

24:25.658 --> 24:28.593
and it just turns up the
creep factor, like, a million.

24:28.627 --> 24:30.094
<i>It's awesome and gross.</i>

24:30.129 --> 24:31.629
<i>It just, like,
draws your attention</i>

24:31.664 --> 24:34.065
<i>to the fact that it's
a human head on her shoulder.</i>

24:34.099 --> 24:36.067
It was a human head.
[laughs]

24:42.942 --> 24:43.908
No.

24:43.943 --> 24:45.910
The forehead
is starting to press

24:45.945 --> 24:48.780
<i>underneath the weight
of the cowl.</i>

24:51.283 --> 24:52.584
Okay.

24:52.618 --> 24:54.352
The more we patch it, it's just
making the edge thicker

24:54.386 --> 24:55.820
<i>instead of making it better.</i>

24:55.855 --> 24:58.389
Our time is almost
next to nothing,

24:58.424 --> 25:00.458
and that's
when I start panicking.

25:00.492 --> 25:02.293
How much time is left?

25:02.328 --> 25:03.761
24 minutes, not much.

25:15.641 --> 25:16.808
Time!

25:19.011 --> 25:20.545
<i>This is my cowl.</i>

25:20.579 --> 25:22.313
<i>It's my application of it,</i>

25:22.348 --> 25:24.015
and that's a lot of weight
for me as a makeup artist.

25:24.049 --> 25:25.750
<i>It's just disappointing.</i>

25:25.784 --> 25:28.620
I've got to find a way
to fix it.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.858
Here we go.

25:36.860 --> 25:38.861
We get to the stage
for Last Looks...

25:38.929 --> 25:41.530
I'm trying to figure out
how to get the face on here.

25:41.598 --> 25:43.933
And the face
doesn't fit over the cowl.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.468
<i>So we've cut the chin part out</i>

25:45.535 --> 25:47.336
and make sure
it fits on the face,

25:47.404 --> 25:50.439
<i>but now we have to reattach
her little chin flap,</i>

25:50.507 --> 25:51.841
where we've cut the appliance.

25:51.908 --> 25:52.942
We got to get moving.

25:55.379 --> 25:56.980
I'm gonna start.

25:57.047 --> 25:58.247
<i>We really want our makeup</i>

25:58.315 --> 25:59.816
to look as disgusting
as possible.

25:59.883 --> 26:02.118
<i>So we put on slime,
and then we put on more slime</i>

26:02.186 --> 26:04.654
<i>because you can never have
enough slime.</i>

26:04.722 --> 26:06.456
Okay, do you see here?

26:06.523 --> 26:08.391
Maybe hide this edge.

26:08.459 --> 26:10.426
Time is running out,
and I don't like it.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.031
I think that looks really dumb

26:15.099 --> 26:17.266
'cause it doesn't
serve a purpose.

26:18.635 --> 26:21.437
We have a big freaking ridge
over the whole thing.

26:21.505 --> 26:23.272
<i>I mean, that's even worse.</i>

26:23.340 --> 26:24.640
It looks like
the San Andreas Fault

26:24.708 --> 26:25.808
in the middle of her head.

26:26.810 --> 26:27.977
Ten minutes!

26:37.187 --> 26:38.421
That's time, everyone!

26:38.489 --> 26:42.125
I'm really frustrated
the ridge is there.

26:42.192 --> 26:43.426
<i>It's very prominent.</i>

26:43.494 --> 26:45.328
<i>I know we're gonna get
fucked for that.</i>

26:45.396 --> 26:47.530
So I expect to be
in the bottom looks.

26:56.173 --> 26:58.408
Welcome
to the Face Off Reveal Stage.

26:58.475 --> 27:01.644
Say hello to our lovely
series judges.

27:01.712 --> 27:04.147
Owner of Alchemy Studio,
Glenn Hetrick.

27:04.214 --> 27:06.182
- Good evening.
all: - Good evening.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.483
Oscar and Emmy award-winning
makeup artist,

27:07.551 --> 27:08.684
Ve Neill.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.586
- Hi, guys.
all: - Hi, Ve.

27:10.654 --> 27:13.156
And creature and concept
designer Neville Page.

27:13.223 --> 27:14.824
- Hello.
- Hi, Neville.

27:14.892 --> 27:16.325
All right, let's get to it.

27:16.393 --> 27:18.294
For this week's
Spotlight Challenge

27:18.362 --> 27:20.696
we asked you
to choose a microorganism

27:20.764 --> 27:23.032
and use it as inspiration
for an alien entity

27:23.100 --> 27:25.868
bursting out of its host.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.737
So let's take a look
at your creations.

27:51.795 --> 27:55.064
<i>It's so gross and delightful,
and I'm proud of this one.</i>

27:55.132 --> 27:57.033
Even though we had immunity,
we still brought it.

27:57.101 --> 27:58.734
We still put out
a really good look.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.357
<i>This is what we were going for.</i>

28:21.425 --> 28:23.559
<i>It's gross.
It's scary. It's shocking.</i>

28:23.627 --> 28:24.861
I think we pulled it off.

28:48.085 --> 28:50.219
<i>We have accomplished
the alien entity coming out.</i>

28:50.287 --> 28:52.255
<i>I feel like we nailed that part,</i>

28:52.322 --> 28:54.524
<i>but I can definitely
see the edge</i>

28:54.591 --> 28:55.591
<i>from where I'm standing,</i>

28:55.659 --> 28:57.727
and I know
that's a terrible sign.

29:19.216 --> 29:20.716
<i>I really love this character.</i>

29:20.784 --> 29:23.920
<i>He looks awesome
and gross and scary,</i>

29:23.987 --> 29:26.422
and I'm hoping that
it's gonna scare the judges.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.279
<i>Our alien's bursting out</i>

29:50.347 --> 29:52.381
<i>in a completely different way
than everyone else's.</i>

29:52.449 --> 29:55.618
I don't know if it's good
or bad, but I like it.

30:01.491 --> 30:03.292
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look?

30:08.932 --> 30:10.266
I like the blue slime.

30:10.334 --> 30:11.801
It's kind of pretty, actually.

30:11.868 --> 30:13.436
This is
a really great opportunity

30:13.503 --> 30:16.572
to play with colors to make
it look more interesting,

30:16.640 --> 30:17.773
and they took advantage of that.

30:17.841 --> 30:19.008
This one really

30:19.076 --> 30:21.944
capitalizes
on the busting-out idea.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.847
This is much better up close.

30:24.915 --> 30:26.182
When you get in a little closer,

30:26.250 --> 30:29.185
you can see that the skin
is actually peeling back.

30:29.253 --> 30:33.022
Shape's kind of weird.
It's just lumpy.

30:33.090 --> 30:35.224
It doesn't feel specific enough.

30:35.292 --> 30:38.928
[whirring]

30:38.996 --> 30:41.130
- Ugh.
- I think you got slimed.

30:41.198 --> 30:42.398
Oh, yeah.

30:44.001 --> 30:45.868
There's not much going on
with the front,

30:45.936 --> 30:48.004
and it's just like
a bald-cap transition.

30:49.239 --> 30:51.407
That whole thing is,
like, slipping forward.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.644
This whole thing
isn't put on her.

30:56.446 --> 30:58.314
So soft in its detail.

30:58.382 --> 30:59.649
It should be more defined.

30:59.716 --> 31:01.517
Turn the other way.

31:01.585 --> 31:02.985
I do like this concept

31:03.053 --> 31:05.121
that the nose is split in half.

31:05.188 --> 31:08.124
I just wish it wasn't
bifurcated almost perfectly.

31:08.191 --> 31:11.861
As the judges start to touch
the middle of the face,

31:11.928 --> 31:13.429
<i>I start getting nervous,</i>

31:13.497 --> 31:15.665
<i>'cause that's the most
important part of the makeup.</i>

31:15.732 --> 31:17.733
Never split a makeup
right down the middle.

31:17.801 --> 31:20.436
<i>I'm thinking
they could possibly hate it.</i>

31:23.840 --> 31:25.775
All right, guys,
it's time to get on Twitter

31:25.842 --> 31:27.943
and tell us who made
your favorite creation tonight,

31:28.011 --> 31:30.246
using #FaceOff

31:33.235 --> 31:36.403
I just wish it wasn't bifurcated
almost perfectly.

31:36.471 --> 31:38.105
Never split a makeup
right down the middle.

31:38.173 --> 31:40.374
I'm thinking
they could possibly hate it

31:40.442 --> 31:42.543
<i>even though I'm happy
with what I've done.</i>

31:42.611 --> 31:44.411
To me, it doesn't look like
it's coming out of him.

31:44.479 --> 31:45.746
It looks like he's transforming.

31:45.814 --> 31:47.681
Mm-hmm.

31:47.749 --> 31:49.650
This feels more appropriate
in terms of

31:49.718 --> 31:51.218
separation of the tones

31:51.286 --> 31:54.421
between the victim
and the alien organism.

31:54.489 --> 31:57.591
Can you turn that way,
come around?

31:57.659 --> 31:58.826
This one is so cool.

31:58.894 --> 32:02.196
It's coming out in
so many different areas.

32:02.264 --> 32:03.230
Thanks.

32:07.969 --> 32:10.104
Okay, the judges
would like to speak

32:10.171 --> 32:11.639
with each of you
to find out more

32:11.706 --> 32:13.207
about your work.

32:13.275 --> 32:14.475
Walter and Johnny,
please step forward.

32:22.717 --> 32:23.884
Tell us about your concept.

32:23.952 --> 32:25.719
Our creature was the tardigrade,

32:25.787 --> 32:28.222
so it is messing with his DNA,

32:28.290 --> 32:31.125
as well as physically
leaving his body.

32:31.192 --> 32:33.727
I definitely think
it's a great concept.

32:35.697 --> 32:36.864
How did you break up the work?

32:36.932 --> 32:39.633
I did
the facial-appliance sculpt

32:39.701 --> 32:41.468
and the cowl sculpt.

32:41.536 --> 32:43.938
I sculpted the monster

32:44.005 --> 32:45.673
and the mouth.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.041
I love the drill motor.
That's awesome.

32:47.108 --> 32:49.276
But I unfortunately think

32:49.344 --> 32:51.245
that you leaned
a little too heavy

32:51.313 --> 32:53.080
into working out the gags

32:53.148 --> 32:57.084
and didn't spend enough time
developing the form.

32:57.152 --> 32:59.219
I loved your
little spinning goodie

32:59.287 --> 33:00.588
and the squirting,

33:00.655 --> 33:02.423
but one of my main concerns
about this makeup

33:02.490 --> 33:04.558
is, from afar, it looks like
he's wearing

33:04.626 --> 33:09.229
an orange, floppy beret
that's hanging over his eye.

33:09.297 --> 33:11.231
The top piece
is growing out of him,

33:11.299 --> 33:14.034
and the belly piece
is bursting out of him.

33:14.102 --> 33:16.770
I think that's a problem
because you've got

33:16.838 --> 33:20.107
two very different things
occurring at the same time.

33:20.175 --> 33:21.809
So there's some really
cool things about this.

33:21.876 --> 33:24.278
I just don't know if the payoff

33:24.346 --> 33:25.679
is what you had hoped for.

33:25.747 --> 33:27.281
Understood.

33:27.349 --> 33:30.050
Walter and Johnny,
please step down.

33:30.118 --> 33:32.586
Thank you.

33:35.924 --> 33:38.425
Mel and Melissa,
please step forward.

33:44.532 --> 33:45.966
Ladies, tell us
about your concept.

33:46.034 --> 33:47.968
This lab technician

33:48.036 --> 33:49.903
was working
with an unknown sample

33:49.971 --> 33:51.238
when it infected her.

33:51.306 --> 33:54.308
It gradually took over
her interior anatomy,

33:54.376 --> 33:56.710
and it burst through her mouth.

33:56.778 --> 33:58.679
I think you ladies
did a terrific job.

33:58.747 --> 34:01.649
You really spent
a long time sculpting

34:01.716 --> 34:03.017
all the detail into it.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.018
There's lots of form.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.252
Great paint job.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.253
Really nicely done.

34:06.321 --> 34:07.821
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:07.889 --> 34:09.255
Who did what exactly on this?

34:09.324 --> 34:11.225
Melissa was responsible
for sculpting this,

34:11.292 --> 34:13.193
which is part of the cowl,

34:13.261 --> 34:14.395
and I sculpted the face.

34:14.462 --> 34:15.862
There's some
really nice stuff here,

34:15.929 --> 34:18.331
particularly
of the labial radula

34:18.400 --> 34:19.667
of this creature.

34:19.734 --> 34:22.636
And the fact
that you've used human teeth...

34:22.704 --> 34:26.940
it makes it feel like it's got
traces of her DNA still.

34:27.007 --> 34:28.308
There's a beautiful transition

34:28.376 --> 34:30.277
coming off of the cowl
into the face,

34:30.344 --> 34:32.246
so not only do I really like

34:32.313 --> 34:33.947
the shapes of your
alien creature,

34:34.014 --> 34:35.783
I love the way
that you handled the color.

34:35.850 --> 34:37.351
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:37.418 --> 34:39.786
Mel and Melissa,
you can head back.

34:45.293 --> 34:47.828
Katie and Robert,
you're up next.

34:55.603 --> 34:58.806
So tell us about your
microorganism-inspired alien.

34:58.873 --> 35:00.641
Our microorganism
was very wormlike,

35:00.709 --> 35:04.144
and we wanted to turn it
into a food-poisoning story.

35:04.212 --> 35:06.146
It starts to incubate
beneath the skin,

35:06.214 --> 35:08.182
and they start to emerge
when they're fully formed.

35:08.249 --> 35:09.683
His name is Hans.

35:09.751 --> 35:11.318
Hans.

35:11.386 --> 35:12.653
Hans the brain worm.

35:12.721 --> 35:13.987
Ah.

35:14.055 --> 35:15.189
That's how we named him.

35:15.256 --> 35:16.256
Of course it is.
You have to.

35:16.324 --> 35:18.726
- [laughter]
- So who did what?

35:18.793 --> 35:20.360
I did the worm.

35:20.428 --> 35:22.429
I sculpted the cowl
and painted it

35:22.497 --> 35:23.964
and applied it.

35:24.032 --> 35:27.367
You could've done something
much more with this headpiece.

35:29.871 --> 35:32.272
The cowl looks like lumps,
and it's not implying

35:32.340 --> 35:33.874
something is growing
under the flesh.

35:33.942 --> 35:36.310
It feels like the whole thing
is a bit of missed opportunity.

35:36.377 --> 35:37.578
- I know.
- Fair enough.

35:37.645 --> 35:42.049
It looks like a face
sticking out of a hood.

35:42.117 --> 35:43.484
It's not just the shapes.
It's the color.

35:43.551 --> 35:46.220
Her skin tone is her skin tone
with a little makeup on it,

35:46.287 --> 35:48.756
and the rest of it is something
completely different.

35:48.823 --> 35:52.126
Katie and Robert,
please head back.

35:59.300 --> 36:00.868
Rob and Kaleb, you're up.

36:08.443 --> 36:10.811
Tell me about
your alien-organism concept.

36:10.879 --> 36:12.212
Our organism

36:12.280 --> 36:15.315
is a prehistoric parasite
that uses the mucus

36:15.383 --> 36:16.817
to slide under the skin

36:16.885 --> 36:19.353
and eventually make its way out.

36:19.420 --> 36:21.822
I sculpted the face piece
and the cowl,

36:21.890 --> 36:24.491
and Kaleb sculpted
the shoulder and arm appliance.

36:24.559 --> 36:25.993
I think it's pretty damn good.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.028
Thank you.

36:28.096 --> 36:29.429
The delineation
between the flesh

36:29.497 --> 36:30.831
and the organism,
is really well done.

36:30.899 --> 36:33.267
The shapes coming out
of the side of the face

36:33.334 --> 36:36.036
give it a really cool,
creepy look.

36:36.104 --> 36:37.905
Could you have him
turn around for us?

36:37.972 --> 36:41.542
This large tubular thing
going down

36:41.609 --> 36:44.812
into his collarbone
is so amazing.

36:44.879 --> 36:46.880
I love everything that
you've got going on

36:46.948 --> 36:49.183
- on this creature.
- Thank you.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.951
The back is more interesting
than the front,

36:51.019 --> 36:53.520
but in this case,
that's alluring.

36:53.588 --> 36:56.590
Lance Henriksen said the fear
is in the anticipation,

36:56.658 --> 36:59.026
so we decided to put the monster
bursting out the back,

36:59.093 --> 37:00.828
and the reveal
is what brings the fear.

37:00.895 --> 37:02.095
And I love it for that,

37:02.163 --> 37:04.598
because that reveal
on the back is so good.

37:04.666 --> 37:05.866
Thank you.

37:05.934 --> 37:08.001
Rob and Kaleb, please step back.

37:14.442 --> 37:15.776
Anna and Yvonne.

37:23.785 --> 37:26.253
Would you please tell us
about your concept?

37:26.321 --> 37:28.956
Matt here was a patient
in a hospital

37:29.023 --> 37:31.558
where this microorganism
outbreak happened,

37:31.626 --> 37:34.828
so we had it bursting
out of the side of the face.

37:34.896 --> 37:36.263
This doesn't quite make it.

37:37.932 --> 37:40.834
It doesn't look like anything
has really burst out of him,

37:40.902 --> 37:42.302
and it looks like you just have

37:42.370 --> 37:44.671
a big line of demarcation
down the front of his face,

37:44.739 --> 37:46.039
which is always a bad decision.

37:47.675 --> 37:49.076
This layering of flesh,

37:49.143 --> 37:51.178
it's just stacks
of this fatty tissue,

37:51.246 --> 37:52.412
and then it stops.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.714
It doesn't really transition

37:53.781 --> 37:54.882
in an interesting way.

37:54.949 --> 37:58.585
The end result
is contrived and boring.

38:00.488 --> 38:02.589
Anna and Yvonne,
please head back.

38:06.694 --> 38:07.694
Thanks, guys.

38:07.762 --> 38:08.962
Please head back
to the makeup room

38:09.030 --> 38:10.063
while the judges deliberate.

38:10.131 --> 38:12.099
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:13.735 --> 38:16.837
Okay, judges,
that one-time special immunity

38:16.905 --> 38:18.739
is still available
if you'd like to use it tonight.

38:18.806 --> 38:21.675
So, with that, let's talk
about tonight's makeups.

38:21.743 --> 38:23.010
Let's begin
with Melissa and Mel.

38:23.077 --> 38:26.380
You know, everybody else
was mainly fleshy colors,

38:26.447 --> 38:28.115
and they took it
into those blue tones

38:28.182 --> 38:31.051
which really helped separate
the alien from the human.

38:31.119 --> 38:32.486
Yeah, the color was beautiful.

38:32.553 --> 38:35.555
Out of everything tonight,
it felt the most

38:35.623 --> 38:36.957
what it was that
we were asking for.

38:37.025 --> 38:38.859
All right, let's move on
to Rob and Kaleb.

38:38.927 --> 38:41.295
Oh, this was a bitchin' makeup.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.863
They did a great paint job.

38:42.931 --> 38:44.598
At any moment,
you thought this thing

38:44.666 --> 38:45.732
was just gonna start
squirming around.

38:45.800 --> 38:46.900
It looked so great.

38:46.968 --> 38:49.202
Kaleb did a really beautiful job

38:49.270 --> 38:51.305
on the shoulder and the arm,

38:51.372 --> 38:53.307
but the pièce de résistance

38:53.374 --> 38:57.177
is what Rob had done
with the face and the cowl.

38:57.245 --> 39:00.080
All right, let's move on
to Katie and Robert.

39:00.148 --> 39:02.115
There was nothing
happening on the surface,

39:02.183 --> 39:06.920
and the Hans parasite
was almost a direct take

39:06.988 --> 39:08.722
off of their source material.

39:08.790 --> 39:11.358
I'm a lot happier
with Robert's worm

39:11.426 --> 39:14.227
than the rocks in the sock
that Katie put on her head,

39:14.295 --> 39:17.364
and the seam is one of the worst
I've ever seen on the show.

39:17.432 --> 39:19.666
Okay, how about Anna and Yvonne?

39:19.734 --> 39:21.668
To me, it looked
more like a transformation.

39:21.736 --> 39:23.971
It did not look
like a bursting out.

39:24.038 --> 39:26.940
It just looked like
a sick guy on one side,

39:27.008 --> 39:29.042
and some strange lumpy thing
on another.

39:29.110 --> 39:30.677
All right, judges,
have you made up your mind?

39:30.745 --> 39:31.878
- Yes, we have.
- Yes, we have.

39:31.946 --> 39:34.081
Let's bring 'em back out.

39:37.251 --> 39:39.319
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top teams.

39:39.387 --> 39:42.489
Melissa and Mel,
we love that you guys used

39:42.557 --> 39:44.291
so much color in your character,

39:44.359 --> 39:46.426
and you did a very good job
of transitions,

39:46.494 --> 39:48.328
both in the sculpture
and the paint work.

39:48.396 --> 39:50.230
Rob and Kaleb,

39:50.298 --> 39:51.631
you made great choices

39:51.699 --> 39:53.700
with all of your shapes
in the unique way

39:53.768 --> 39:55.702
that they broke
through the skin.

39:55.770 --> 39:57.404
We also really liked the way
that you used color

39:57.472 --> 39:58.739
throughout the whole piece.

39:58.806 --> 40:00.340
All right,
which team came out on top?

40:00.408 --> 40:03.877
The top team tonight is...

40:08.527 --> 40:10.194
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top team.

40:10.229 --> 40:13.231
The top team tonight is...

40:16.268 --> 40:18.036
Rob and Kaleb.

40:20.506 --> 40:23.241
Your sculpture gave us
a fantastic sense of movement,

40:23.275 --> 40:26.344
which made your alien entity
feel almost alive.

40:26.378 --> 40:27.579
Very well handled, gentlemen.

40:27.613 --> 40:28.880
Both:
Thank you.

40:28.914 --> 40:30.014
Rob and Kaleb, fantastic job.

40:30.049 --> 40:32.350
But as you know,
we can only have one winner.

40:32.384 --> 40:33.518
Glenn?

40:33.552 --> 40:37.055
The winner of
tonight's challenge is...

40:37.089 --> 40:38.089
Rob.

40:40.926 --> 40:43.061
The back side of that cowl
was just amazing.

40:43.095 --> 40:45.663
Those varying shapes,
some plant, some animal,

40:45.698 --> 40:47.098
they were just phenomenal.

40:47.132 --> 40:49.067
And congrats
on the back-to-back wins.

40:49.101 --> 40:50.501
Thank you very much.

40:50.536 --> 40:52.136
I feel pretty damn good,
to be honest.

40:52.171 --> 40:54.839
I feel like it's giving me
the energy boost that I need.

40:54.873 --> 40:56.174
Rob, congratulations.

40:56.208 --> 40:57.241
Thank you.

40:57.276 --> 40:59.978
You, Kaleb, Melissa, Mel,

41:00.012 --> 41:01.512
Johnny, and Walter are all safe

41:01.547 --> 41:03.214
and can head back
to the makeup room.

41:03.248 --> 41:04.682
Thank you.

41:10.322 --> 41:12.090
All right, guys, that means

41:12.124 --> 41:14.092
the rest of you
are on the bottom tonight,

41:14.126 --> 41:15.760
and one of you
will be going home.

41:15.794 --> 41:17.028
Please step forward.

41:25.504 --> 41:27.305
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

41:27.339 --> 41:29.240
Katie and Robert,
your cowl lacked

41:29.274 --> 41:31.409
the proper forms
to convey your story,

41:31.443 --> 41:34.278
and though the worm mechanism
was a fun idea,

41:34.313 --> 41:35.747
it didn't quite come together.

41:35.781 --> 41:40.084
Anna and Yvonne, this read as
more of a transformation makeup

41:40.119 --> 41:42.086
than something
bursting from within,

41:42.121 --> 41:44.956
and the cowl
really lacked detail.

41:44.990 --> 41:46.758
So who is going home tonight?

41:46.792 --> 41:48.726
The person
going home tonight is...

41:55.067 --> 41:56.100
Katie.

41:56.135 --> 41:58.202
It was the lumpy cowl

41:58.237 --> 42:00.204
and the mismatched paint job

42:00.239 --> 42:02.540
that stood out as the most
problematic elements

42:02.574 --> 42:04.642
- of this makeup.
- Fair enough.

42:04.677 --> 42:07.045
Katie, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

42:07.079 --> 42:09.747
That means,
Robert, Yvonne, and Anna,

42:09.782 --> 42:12.116
you're all safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

42:12.151 --> 42:13.151
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:16.689 --> 42:19.157
Katie, we've all
had a chance to see

42:19.191 --> 42:20.291
some great work come out of you,

42:20.325 --> 42:22.427
and we've also had
a chance to see

42:22.461 --> 42:24.328
a great attitude,
so thank you very much.

42:24.363 --> 42:25.963
- It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you very much.

42:25.998 --> 42:27.699
Katie, it's been great
having you here with us,

42:27.733 --> 42:30.168
but if you'd please head
back to the makeup room

42:30.202 --> 42:31.269
and pack up your kit.

42:31.303 --> 42:32.270
Thank you very much, guys.

42:32.304 --> 42:33.838
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Katie.

42:33.872 --> 42:36.207
<i>I am sad,</i>

42:36.241 --> 42:39.343
but I'm very proud
of what I've done here.

42:39.378 --> 42:40.678
I'm going home.

42:40.713 --> 42:42.380
No!

42:42.414 --> 42:43.648
<i>I feel like it was
a big success.</i>

42:43.682 --> 42:46.017
Some of the makeups
may not have been successes,

42:46.051 --> 42:48.919
but I'm proud of myself
for the effort and my attitude.

42:50.020 --> 42:52.229
I think I'm a better
make-up artist now.

42:52.230 --> 42:53.956
I feel like total fire.

42:55.051 --> 42:56.721
This is life-changing for me.
