- I'm sure

13:59.214 --> 14:00.966
she's fine, Courtney.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.551
We'll keep an eye out.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.761
Fuck you, Lyla.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.264
I'll find her myself.

14:07.264 --> 14:08.890
And if anyone has hurt my baby,

14:08.890 --> 14:11.059
you're all gonna wish
you were dead.

14:14.104 --> 14:17.691
Sorry about that.
Back to spiders.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.693
Let's call every pet shop
and aquarium on the island.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.528
See if anyone's
putting in regular orders

14:21.528 --> 14:23.530
for live feeder insects.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.824
[Kalama] Yes, ma'am.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.624
I see you, you little
secret hottie. [chuckles]

14:34.624 --> 14:37.002
- You're wasted.
- And honest.

14:37.002 --> 14:40.213
Whip out these fucking
milky milks and own it.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.299
Let's show Dylan the real you.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.718
- Why?
- So he can see
what he's missing.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.624
Babe, I'm sorry.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.709
I-I'm just telling you

15:35.435 --> 15:37.187
Why would she be with me?
You're her bestie.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.396
You drove her there.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.439
- What?
- Stop. Stop, okay?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.982
I walked home, too.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.400
I mean, she texted she got out.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.778
I mean, we all thought
she was safe.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.030
Maybe she turned her phone off
to do a drug deal.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.823
They do that sometimes
so people can't track them.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.325
She's not in some
Columbian drug cartel.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.118
The killer always texts
after they kill someone.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.120
First the video
of Johnny, and then...

15:54.120 --> 15:56.122
[Margot] Yes, we all know about

15:56.122 --> 15:58.083
- that pathetic excuse
for a sex tape.
- [Dylan] My point is

15:58.083 --> 15:59.876
that we haven't gotten a text.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.671
- That is a good sign.
- [Alison] And we can't just

16:02.671 --> 16:05.256
rely on a psycho killer
to text regularly.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.050
We need to try to find her.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.761
[knocking]

16:09.761 --> 16:11.763
I'm having private time.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.766
What the fuck, Kyle?
Are you deaf?

16:14.766 --> 16:16.559
I said I'm having private time.

16:16.559 --> 16:17.852
[Kyle] Got to get
to your appointment.

16:17.852 --> 16:20.438
Your mom said no excuses.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.317
Shit. I have therapy.

16:24.317 --> 16:28.071
Promise you'll update me
constantly.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.407
I don't know what I'll do if
something happened to our Riri.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.127
<i>[Bruce] So,</i>

16:42.127 --> 16:44.504
uh, you were the line cook
on the Limp Shrimp truck.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.465
Yeah. My brother runs it.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.719
- [phone camera clicks]
- Right.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.263
You know,
I'm looking for someone

16:53.263 --> 16:54.681
a little more professional.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.266
Thanks for coming in.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.394
Cool. Could I just get
a selfie in the bathroom,

16:59.394 --> 17:01.646
you know,
where those dudes got capped?

17:01.646 --> 17:03.398
Brah, come on.
It's just a selfie.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.774
Get the fuck out of here.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.277
Brah? What is up?

17:07.277 --> 17:09.195
Did you, like, do it
or something?

17:09.195 --> 17:11.489
I don't think you want
to post that and find out.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.326
Hey, brah, no selfies
in the bathroom,

17:15.326 --> 17:16.786
if that's what you're thinking.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.204
I'm thinking
you pee outside, freak.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.206
[sighs]
Hey, Courtney.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.459
I'm sorry, we're not open yet.
Should be soon.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.753
I don't care
about my stupid job.

17:24.753 --> 17:28.923
I mean, I need the goddamned
money, but I can't find Riley.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.759
She's not here.
Did you try calling her?

17:30.759 --> 17:32.761
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

17:32.761 --> 17:34.679
Do I look like a fucking idiot?

17:34.679 --> 17:37.640
She didn't answer, and your
girlfriend won't look for her.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.935
Well, listen, I'm sure
Riley's fine, all right?

17:40.935 --> 17:42.479
Teenagers do this shit
all the time.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.981
No, don't pat me.
This is serious.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.650
You need to tell your fuck buddy
to quit looking

17:47.650 --> 17:49.486
for killer spiders
and find my kid.

17:49.486 --> 17:52.530
I have this sick feeling inside.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.699
You know what I mean?

17:54.699 --> 17:57.869
Like, sick...
like when your kid's in trouble.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.872
I'll, um...

18:00.872 --> 18:03.374
Yeah, I'll talk to Lyla.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.084
See if there's anything
she can do.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.505
[voice breaking]
I cannot lose my baby.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.590
Believe me, I know.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.218
At least you had a spare.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.936
[phone chimes]

18:24.687 --> 18:26.356
Is that Riley?

18:26.356 --> 18:27.941
No.

18:27.941 --> 18:31.236
- [music playing in truck]
- Whoa!

18:31.236 --> 18:33.905
[music recedes]

18:33.905 --> 18:36.991
- You okay?
- [chuckles softly] Yeah.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.661
Seriously?

18:39.661 --> 18:42.121
When did this become
our fucking lives?

18:42.121 --> 18:45.708
[chuckles softly]

18:45.708 --> 18:47.460
- Yeah, searching
the side of the road,
- [clears throat]

18:47.460 --> 18:49.170
while a killer fucks with us

18:49.170 --> 18:51.047
isn't what you meant
when you said,

18:51.047 --> 18:53.883
"Our futures will be brighter
than we can ever imagine."

18:53.883 --> 18:55.885
When the fuck did I say that?

18:55.885 --> 18:57.929
Your valedictorian speech.

18:57.929 --> 19:01.140
Right. God, that sucked.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.393
Maybe I do deserve to die.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.566
Ah, I bet this guy's
life sucks, too.

19:15.196 --> 19:18.950
It's not exactly how any of us
thought things would turn out.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.827
[Alison] At least you got
to go to MIT.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.329
I mean, it's all you talked
about since, like, second grade,

19:23.329 --> 19:25.415
when the rest of us were
all obsessed with Furbys.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.500
[Dylan] It wasn't
what I expected, either.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.254
Sorry.

19:33.256 --> 19:35.258
What the fuck's a Furby?

19:35.258 --> 19:37.719
Just this weird robot thing
with, like, big eyes and...

19:37.719 --> 19:39.721
I mean, you didn't
miss anything.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.349
She was definitely
dating the clown.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.351
[chuckling softly]

19:48.646 --> 19:53.568
Do you remember in, um... in
fourth grade when that kid Joe

19:53.568 --> 19:55.653
made fun of Riley
for wearing the same clothes,

19:55.653 --> 19:57.989
like, two days in a row?

19:57.989 --> 20:00.366
I mean, you felt so bad
that you came to school

20:00.366 --> 20:02.827
wearing the same clothes
for, like, three weeks straight.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.706
Forgot about that.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.959
Yeah, that's when I realized
you were, um...

20:11.836 --> 20:14.255
[Dylan] A total simp?

20:15.757 --> 20:17.759
I didn't think you were
paying attention to anything

20:17.759 --> 20:19.302
except how to beat me.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.763
Yeah, I never could.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.139
You were valedictorian.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.266
Only 'cause I cheated.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.101
I mean,

20:27.101 --> 20:28.645
I may or may not have fucked
Mr. Haskell

20:28.645 --> 20:29.979
to get an "A" in A.P. Bio.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.065
Oh, that.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.026
What? You knew?

20:35.026 --> 20:38.613
Everyone knew
you'd do anything to win.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.281
Wow. Okay.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.950
It's not all that flattering.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.827
So why'd you hook up with me?

20:45.870 --> 20:47.622
It was grad night.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.959
You gave me drugs.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.961
Yeah, there was that.

20:54.212 --> 20:56.881
And I was into you.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.509
I thought you loved Alison.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.512
I did.

21:04.973 --> 21:08.267
Maybe I just remind you of her.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.602
You're nothing like her.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.234
I'm just fucked-up.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.781
[rustling]

21:21.781 --> 21:24.075
[Alison] Riley?

21:24.075 --> 21:26.077
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Riley!
- Riley!

21:26.077 --> 21:28.204
Riley!

21:28.204 --> 21:31.040
Oh. Hey, puppy.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.918
[Dylan] What you got there?

21:36.045 --> 21:37.839
- Oh!
- Whoa! [gasping]

21:39.465 --> 21:41.467
[panting]

21:53.062 --> 21:55.314
The police found your spiders.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.319
Two visits in one week?

22:00.319 --> 22:01.904
Finding your way back?

22:01.904 --> 22:04.824
[sighs]
You need to leave.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.829
Someone broke in last night.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.419
Went through the photo albums.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.630
I told you to get rid of those.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.133
You have no authority here.

22:22.133 --> 22:25.386
I know that makes you
uncomfortable.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.640
I'm just trying to help you.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.684
I'm not the one who needs help.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.272
Police are gonna figure out
where those spiders came from.

22:39.442 --> 22:43.905
Even if I did leave, your
secrets would still be here.

22:43.905 --> 22:47.658
You're not wearing 'em well
these days. [sighs]

22:47.658 --> 22:50.161
Clara?

22:50.161 --> 22:51.579
Do you know what happened

22:51.579 --> 22:52.747
to Courtney Thacker's
daughter Riley?

22:59.253 --> 23:00.797
[phone chimes]

23:11.557 --> 23:14.185

- [horn honking]

23:14.185 --> 23:15.770
Fuck off!

23:15.770 --> 23:18.606
[engine revving]

23:18.606 --> 23:20.441
We should have
been there for her.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.068
She should not be dead
right now.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.653
Okay, we don't know that she is.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.488
I mean, that shark bit off
Bethany's whole arm,

23:25.488 --> 23:27.198
and she lived,
and won Pipeline.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.741
I love <i>Soul Surfer,</i>

23:28.741 --> 23:30.201
but this is like slitting
your wrists times a million.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.912
Mary Vincent got raped,
had both her arms chopped off

23:32.912 --> 23:34.747
and was left naked in a ditch.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.791
And she climbed all the way up
to the road to get rescued.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.626
Are you seriously saying

23:38.626 --> 23:40.962
that Riley's naked with no arms
in a ditch someplace?

23:40.962 --> 23:42.380
You're so disturbed.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.382
I'm saying she could be alive.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.303
We have to go back to Clara's.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.516
[Margot] This time
we're going prepared.

23:53.516 --> 23:54.600
[Alison] What the hell?

23:54.600 --> 23:55.685
My dad's from New Jersey.

23:55.685 --> 23:57.145
Guns are not part of the plan.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.437
May I remind you,
it was your plan

23:58.437 --> 23:59.772
that got Riley
into this situation.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.982
- Fuck you.
- Do it.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.400
I will take you down so fast.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.735
Stop!
No one's taking anyone down.

24:04.735 --> 24:07.280
We have to do this together.
It's the only way we'll be safe.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.699
- Guns will keep us safe.
- Really?

24:09.699 --> 24:11.117
[Margot chuckles softly]

24:11.117 --> 24:13.870
All that cop's gun did
was kill Harold.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.455
[phones chiming]

24:25.464 --> 24:27.592
[sighs]
Riley, if you're okay,

24:27.592 --> 24:29.510
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.637

I am not fucking scared of you.

We need to talk.

or something?

28:56.110 --> 28:57.736
Hmm. She would have
told you herself

28:57.736 --> 28:59.738
if you were important
to her in any way.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.832

Of course I knew about it.

No, she's not,
but your mother's alive.

I know it's...

29:49.288 --> 29:51.916
it's a lot to take in,
but I just...

29:51.916 --> 29:54.627
I don't want there to be
any more secrets between us.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.548
She killed herself.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.967
That's what she told me
to tell you.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.095
It's not true.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.722
She left us.

30:07.765 --> 30:10.559
[crying] Seriously, Dad,
this-this isn't funny.

30:10.559 --> 30:13.395
I was gonna tell you,
right after, I swear.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.856
I got home, and I thought,
"Fuck her.

30:15.856 --> 30:18.067
They deserve to know what kind
of a person she really is."

30:18.067 --> 30:19.568
But then I...

30:19.568 --> 30:22.655
I looked at your little faces,

30:22.655 --> 30:24.448
and I just...

30:24.448 --> 30:26.700
[crying] So you said
she killed herself?

30:26.700 --> 30:31.163
It seemed better at the time.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.332
I know that sounds crazy,
but I...

30:35.876 --> 30:39.213
What was I supposed to say
to my eight-year-old girls?

30:39.213 --> 30:40.589
It can't...
it can't be that simple.

have happened.

You don't wake up one day

30:45.427 --> 30:47.555
and just decide
to leave your family.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.058
This guy we knew from the cult
came to visit us.

30:52.101 --> 30:54.270
Fred Phillips?

30:59.024 --> 31:01.777
My sister was in touch with him.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.404
[chuckles softly]

31:06.448 --> 31:09.994
You told her the truth
and not me?

31:09.994 --> 31:11.954
No.

31:11.954 --> 31:13.998
Well, she fucking knew.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.916
That's-that's...
oh, that's-that's what

31:15.916 --> 31:17.835
she was trying to tell me
that night at the party.

31:17.835 --> 31:20.129
That's why she said
Mom didn't love me.

31:20.129 --> 31:21.547
That's why we got in that fight.

31:21.547 --> 31:24.049
That's... that's-that's why
I took her car.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.676
[Bruce] It's not your fault.

31:25.676 --> 31:28.429
I got into a fight
with her that night, too,

31:28.429 --> 31:30.306
on the way home, so I...

31:30.306 --> 31:33.851
I pulled over,
and I told her to get out.

31:33.851 --> 31:36.729
What?

31:36.729 --> 31:38.606
Yeah, I did that all the time

you know that.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.868
It was me.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.237

it's better that way.

to find out about Riley.
