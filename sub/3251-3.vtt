81 residents.

01:52.786 --> 01:54.287
Look at this.

01:54.289 --> 01:55.755
It's a load of stones
and lumps of wood.

02:03.298 --> 02:06.032
What is it?

02:06.034 --> 02:07.633
A load of stones
and lumps of wood.

02:12.105 --> 02:13.972
<i>Uh, the sign</i>
<i>does say "keep out".</i>

02:13.974 --> 02:15.574
I see "keep out"
signs

02:15.576 --> 02:17.776
as suggestions, more
than actual orders,

02:17.778 --> 02:20.746
like "dry clean
only".

02:46.906 --> 02:49.675
That's not right.

02:55.214 --> 02:57.048
It's a streetlamp.

02:57.050 --> 02:58.417
An electric
streetlamp,

02:58.419 --> 02:59.784
about 10 years
too early.

02:59.786 --> 03:01.152
It's only a few
years out.

03:01.154 --> 03:02.587
That's what you said
when you left

03:02.589 --> 03:04.089
your phone charger
in Henry VIII's en suite.

03:04.091 --> 03:05.356
Doctor, um --

03:05.358 --> 03:08.359
Anachronistic electricity,
"keep out" signs,

03:08.361 --> 03:09.594
aggressive stares --

03:09.596 --> 03:12.196
has someone been peeking
at my Christmas list?

03:12.198 --> 03:13.364
Doctor.

03:32.784 --> 03:34.585
Tea.

03:34.587 --> 03:36.654
But the strong
stuff --

03:36.656 --> 03:38.589
leave the bag in.

03:42.494 --> 03:45.062
What you doin'
here, son?

03:45.064 --> 03:47.865
"Son"? Ha.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.200
You can stay.

03:49.202 --> 03:52.403
Sir, might I inquire
who you is?

03:52.405 --> 03:54.171
Of course.
I'm the Doctor.

03:54.173 --> 03:55.273
This is --

03:55.275 --> 03:57.441
no need to stand.
You see that?

03:57.443 --> 03:58.909
Manners!

03:58.911 --> 04:00.411
Oh, thank you.

04:00.413 --> 04:01.813
But I don't need
a new suit.

04:01.815 --> 04:03.715
I'm the
undertaker, sir.

04:06.184 --> 04:07.685
I got
a question.

04:07.687 --> 04:10.621
Is you an alien?

04:10.623 --> 04:12.189
Well, um --

04:12.191 --> 04:13.424
bit personal.

04:13.426 --> 04:15.059
It's all relative,
isn't it?

04:15.061 --> 04:17.095
I mean, I think
<i>you're</i> the aliens.

04:17.096 --> 04:18.463
But, in this
context, yes,

04:18.464 --> 04:22.901
yes, I suppose
I am.

04:22.903 --> 04:24.269
Uh, guys?

04:24.271 --> 04:27.038
Doctor?!
Put him down!

04:27.040 --> 04:28.540
Don't think
we won't kill you!

04:28.542 --> 04:30.242
Doctor!
Leave her alone!

04:30.244 --> 04:32.444
Don't worry. Everything
is completely under control.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.213
Guys. Guys!

04:34.215 --> 04:37.050
Guys.

04:37.052 --> 04:39.486
Whoa-oa-oa!
Get out!

04:39.488 --> 04:40.920
Ahh!

04:42.155 --> 04:45.125
Ow! Ah.

04:45.127 --> 04:46.159
Oh!

04:49.965 --> 04:52.533
He's coming.

04:52.535 --> 04:53.767
Oh, God,

04:53.769 --> 04:55.335
he's coming.

04:56.571 --> 04:57.804
Preacher,

04:57.806 --> 04:59.439
say something.

05:00.874 --> 05:04.810

05:04.812 --> 05:07.812
who art
in heaven,

05:07.814 --> 05:12.083

thy name.

05:12.085 --> 05:14.452

05:20.860 --> 05:22.093
Bowtie.

05:22.095 --> 05:23.727
Get back across
that line.

05:26.331 --> 05:27.865
Now.

05:42.014 --> 05:43.180
Isaac,

05:43.182 --> 05:44.782
he said he was
the Doctor.

05:46.885 --> 05:48.486
An alien Doctor.

05:48.488 --> 05:50.888
No reason to hand him
to his death.

05:50.890 --> 05:52.656
But, Isaac,

05:52.658 --> 05:54.158
it could be him!

05:54.160 --> 05:58.096
You know it ain't.

05:58.098 --> 06:00.264
Ma'am.

06:05.137 --> 06:08.272
Let him go.
Be seein' you, boy.

06:11.877 --> 06:15.079
What was that
outside?

06:15.081 --> 06:17.582
The gunslinger.

06:17.584 --> 06:19.217
Showed up
three weeks back.

06:19.219 --> 06:22.020
We've been prisoners
ever since.

06:22.022 --> 06:23.555
See that borderline
stretchin' round the town?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.056
Woke up one morning,
there it was.

06:25.058 --> 06:28.059
Nothing gets pass it,
in or out.

06:28.061 --> 06:30.762
No supply wagons,
no reinforcements.

06:30.764 --> 06:32.263
Pretty soon,
the whole town's

06:32.265 --> 06:33.765
gonna starve
to death.

06:33.767 --> 06:35.633
But he let <i>us</i> in.

06:35.635 --> 06:37.134
You ain't carryin'
any food,

06:37.136 --> 06:38.635
just three more
mouths to feed.

06:38.637 --> 06:40.771
We'll all die
even sooner, now.

06:40.773 --> 06:43.140
What happens if someone
crosses the line?

06:43.142 --> 06:44.975
Ah! Well.

06:44.977 --> 06:46.876
He wasn't a very good
shot, then.

06:46.878 --> 06:48.378
He was <i>aimin'</i>
<i>for the hat.</i>

06:48.380 --> 06:51.280
He shoots
people's hats?!

06:51.282 --> 06:52.982
I think it was
a warning shot.

06:52.984 --> 06:56.819
Ah! No, yes,
I see, hmm.

06:56.821 --> 06:58.320
What does he want?

06:58.322 --> 07:00.356
Has he issued some
kind of demand?

07:00.358 --> 07:01.791
Says he wants us
to give him

07:01.793 --> 07:03.293
the alien Doctor.

07:03.295 --> 07:04.694
But that's you.

07:04.696 --> 07:06.028
Why would he want
to kill <i>you?</i>

07:06.030 --> 07:07.396
Unless he's met you.

07:07.398 --> 07:08.898
And how could he know
that we'd be here?

07:08.900 --> 07:10.399
<i>We</i> didn't even know
we'd be here.

07:10.401 --> 07:12.534
We were
aiming for Mexico.

07:12.536 --> 07:14.035
The Doctor was
taking us to see

07:14.037 --> 07:15.804
the Day of the Dead
festival.

07:15.806 --> 07:17.839
Mexico's 200 miles
due south.

07:17.841 --> 07:20.475
Well, that's what
happens when people

07:20.477 --> 07:22.410
get toast crumbs
on the console!

07:22.412 --> 07:24.913
Anyway, I think it's about
time I met him. Don't you?

07:24.915 --> 07:25.914
Who?

07:25.916 --> 07:27.415
The chap outside
said I could be

07:27.417 --> 07:29.884
the alien Doctor,
but you said I wasn't,

07:29.886 --> 07:31.553
so you already know
who it is.

07:31.555 --> 07:33.054
Two alien doctors.

07:33.056 --> 07:34.556
We're like buses.

07:34.558 --> 07:36.958
Resident 81, I presume,
so beloved

07:36.960 --> 07:38.460
by the townsfolk,
he warranted

07:38.462 --> 07:40.528
an alteration to
the sign, probably

07:40.530 --> 07:41.629
because he rigged up
these electrics.

07:41.631 --> 07:43.231
And I'm guessing
he's in here because,

07:43.233 --> 07:44.599
if half the town
suddenly wanted

07:44.601 --> 07:45.967
to throw me
to my death,

07:45.969 --> 07:48.069
this is where
I'd want to be.

07:48.071 --> 07:50.472
I don't know what you --
It's all right, Isaac.

07:50.474 --> 07:53.441
I think the time for
subterfuge has passed.

07:55.178 --> 08:00.782
Good afternoon.

08:00.784 --> 08:03.519
My name is
Kahler-Jex.

08:03.521 --> 08:05.788
I'm the Doctor.

08:17.002 --> 08:19.646
The Kahler!
I love the Kahler!

08:19.746 --> 08:21.226
They're one of the most
ingenious races

08:21.227 --> 08:23.727
in the galaxy, seriously,
they could build

08:23.729 --> 08:26.454
a spaceship out of
Tupperware and moss.

08:26.587 --> 08:28.820
All right.
How did you get here?

08:28.822 --> 08:31.556
My craft crashed about
a mile or so out of town.

08:31.558 --> 08:33.826
I would've died if
Isaac and the others

08:33.828 --> 08:35.861
hadn't pulled me
from the wreckage.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.863
And you stayed,
as their doctor.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.099
On my world,
I was a surgeon,

08:40.101 --> 08:41.600
so it seemed logical
and it gave me

08:41.602 --> 08:43.534
an opportunity to repay
my debt to them.

08:43.537 --> 08:45.337
Listen to him,

08:45.339 --> 08:46.872
talkin' like
it was nothing.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.374
Tell them
about the cholera.

08:48.376 --> 08:50.742
Now, Isaac, I'm sure
our guests are --

08:50.744 --> 08:52.344
two years
after he arrived,

08:52.346 --> 08:53.879
there was an outbreak
of cholera.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.481
Thanks to the doc here,
not a single person died.

08:56.483 --> 08:58.015
Minor infection
we'd found

08:58.017 --> 08:59.483
a treatment for
centuries ago.

08:59.485 --> 09:00.785
And then there's the --
what do you call them,

09:00.787 --> 09:02.787
the electrics?

09:02.789 --> 09:04.522
Using my ship
as a generator,

09:04.524 --> 09:06.023
I was able
to rig up

09:06.025 --> 09:07.525
some rudimentary
heating and lighting

09:07.527 --> 09:10.594
for the town.

09:10.596 --> 09:12.262
So why does the
gunslinger want you?

09:12.264 --> 09:14.231
It don't matter.
I'm just saying, if we knew that --

09:14.233 --> 09:15.833
America's the land
of second chances.

09:15.835 --> 09:18.635
We call this town "Mercy"
for a reason.

09:18.637 --> 09:21.071
Though there's some round
here don't feel that way.

09:21.073 --> 09:23.073
Now, Isaac,
we've discussed this.

09:23.075 --> 09:25.175
People whose lives
you saved

09:25.177 --> 09:27.177
are suddenly sayin'
we should hand you over!

09:27.179 --> 09:28.612
They're scared,
that's all.

09:28.614 --> 09:30.014
You can hardly
blame them.

09:30.016 --> 09:33.784
Them bein' scared
scares <i>me.</i>

09:33.786 --> 09:37.221
War only ended
5 years back.

09:37.223 --> 09:40.857
That old violence is still
under the surface.

09:40.859 --> 09:42.559
We give up Doc Jex,
then we're handin'

09:42.561 --> 09:45.362
the keys of the town
over to chaos.

09:45.364 --> 09:48.599
Did you try to repair
your craft?

09:48.601 --> 09:50.066
Surely, someone
with your skills --

09:50.068 --> 09:52.469
It really was
very badly damaged.

09:54.872 --> 09:56.773
We evacuate the town.
Our ship's

09:56.775 --> 09:58.274
just over the hills.
Room for everyone.

09:58.276 --> 10:00.877
I'll pop out and bring it back
here. Robert's your Uncle.

10:00.879 --> 10:02.311
Really?
Simple as that?

10:02.313 --> 10:03.813
No crazy schemes,
no negotiations?

10:03.815 --> 10:06.182
I've matured.
I'm 1,200 years old now.

10:06.184 --> 10:07.716
Plus, I don't want
to miss "The Archers."

10:07.718 --> 10:09.318
Oh, so you're not even
a tiny bit curious?

10:09.320 --> 10:11.219
Why would I be
curious?

10:11.221 --> 10:13.221
It's a mysterious
space-cowboy-assassin.

10:13.223 --> 10:15.857
Curious? Of course
I'm not curious.

10:15.859 --> 10:17.091
Son!

10:17.093 --> 10:18.559
You still got to get
past the gunslinger.

10:18.561 --> 10:19.927
How are you gonna
do that?

10:22.898 --> 10:24.765
With a little
sleight of hand.

10:30.305 --> 10:31.806
Are you okay?

10:31.808 --> 10:33.974
Yeah, fine, yeah.
Keep moving.

10:33.976 --> 10:35.609
Well,
next time,

10:35.611 --> 10:37.211
you get to wear
Jex's clothes.

10:53.962 --> 10:56.430
Can I borrow
your horse, please?

10:56.432 --> 10:58.999
It's official
marshal business.

10:59.001 --> 11:01.701
He's called Joshua.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.871
It's from the Bible.
It means "the deliverer."

11:03.873 --> 11:05.372
No, he isn't.

11:05.374 --> 11:06.373
What?

11:06.375 --> 11:07.741
I speak horse.
He's called Susan.

11:07.743 --> 11:10.478
And he wants you to
respect his life choices.

11:10.480 --> 11:11.845
Hoi!

11:29.831 --> 11:31.699
Ah!

11:31.701 --> 11:34.702
Uh, I think
he's seen us.

11:34.704 --> 11:36.603
This way!

11:42.364 --> 11:43.931
When this is
all done,

11:43.933 --> 11:46.033
do you want us
to take you home?

11:46.035 --> 11:48.302
Thank you, but I've
already given

11:48.304 --> 11:50.604
everything I have
to the Kahler --

11:50.606 --> 11:54.441
my skills,
my energy,

11:54.443 --> 11:57.377
all that was good
in me.

11:57.379 --> 12:01.414
But here, I could
start afresh.

12:01.416 --> 12:06.686
I could remember myself
and help people.

12:06.688 --> 12:08.188
That's all I ever
wanted to do,

12:08.190 --> 12:11.058
end suffering.

12:15.396 --> 12:16.563
Here.

12:16.565 --> 12:19.233
Oh.

12:19.235 --> 12:21.268
You're a mother,
aren't you?

12:21.270 --> 12:22.769
How did you know?

12:22.771 --> 12:24.872
There's kindness
in your eyes.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.641
And sadness.

12:27.643 --> 12:29.643
And a ferocity, too.

12:29.645 --> 12:32.079
It wasn't exactly
straightforward.

12:32.081 --> 12:34.181
It seldom is.

12:34.183 --> 12:36.017
And what
about you,

12:36.019 --> 12:37.518
are you a father?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.921
Yes.

12:39.923 --> 12:42.324
In a way,
I suppose I am.

12:56.140 --> 12:59.476
So, we wait here
'til the Doctor comes

12:59.478 --> 13:01.779
to pick us up
in your ship.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.213
Yes, I know.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.783
I was there when
we agreed it.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.718
Yeah,
I said that more

13:07.720 --> 13:10.187
for my benefit
than yours.

13:15.594 --> 13:17.061
Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa!

13:18.064 --> 13:19.563
Yeah, I know we're
in a hurry.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.065
I just want to check
something out.

13:24.569 --> 13:25.936
Two ticks.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.937
There's something
needling me.

13:29.107 --> 13:30.807
Yes, yes, it
could be important.

13:31.976 --> 13:34.144
Oi!
Don't swear.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.915
Whoa whoa whoa!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

14:15.923 --> 14:18.691
Yes, I wear
a Stetson now.

14:29.203 --> 14:32.905
Yes, good point,
Susan.

14:32.907 --> 14:34.873
Where is
the damage?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.440
Ow!

15:15.916 --> 15:18.517
Ah! Ah!

15:48.881 --> 15:50.781
That's the alarm
on my ship.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.485
Maybe the Doctor wants
to get it working again.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.453
But that wasn't
the plan.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.655
He's not following
the plan.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.957
Welcome
to my world.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.633
Agh! Ah.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.668
<i>Security breach.</i>

16:11.670 --> 16:14.138
<i>You have 10 seconds</i>
<i>to enter the passcode</i>

16:14.140 --> 16:16.440
<i>or this vehicle</i>
<i>will self-destruct.</i>

16:16.442 --> 16:19.243
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for choosing</i>

16:19.245 --> 16:20.944
<i>Abaraxas</i>

16:28.021 --> 16:29.554
<i>self-destruct</i>
<i>overridden.</i>

16:29.556 --> 16:31.889
This is an awful lot
of security

16:31.891 --> 16:33.958
for a titchy spacecraft.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.093
<i>Awaiting command.</i>

16:35.095 --> 16:36.595
Tell me
everything you can

16:36.597 --> 16:38.063
about
the gunslinger.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.065
<i>File not found.</i>
Ah!

16:41.401 --> 16:43.569
<i>Technical specifications,</i>
<i>flight recorder,</i>

16:43.571 --> 16:47.005
<i>personal files,</i>
<i>maps & charts.</i>

16:47.007 --> 16:49.408
Personal files
of Dr. Kahler-Jex.

16:49.410 --> 16:51.643
<i>Names of</i>
<i>deceased subjects</i>

16:51.645 --> 16:53.645
<i>can be found</i>
<i>on the dropdown menu.</i>

16:55.448 --> 16:59.017
<i>Aaaah!</i>

16:59.019 --> 17:00.586
<i>Aaaaaah!</i>

17:00.588 --> 17:03.823
<i>Agggh! Ohhhh!</i>

17:03.825 --> 17:06.925
<i>Ah-agggh!</i>

17:06.926 --> 17:08.894
<i>Aaaah!</i>

17:08.896 --> 17:10.396
<i>Aaaaaaah!</i>

17:17.204 --> 17:18.705
I'm sorry, Amy.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.073
He really should've
followed the plan.

17:27.648 --> 17:28.882
Don't shoot!

17:28.884 --> 17:32.820
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot!

17:32.822 --> 17:34.522
I know
who you are.

17:34.524 --> 17:35.957
And who Jex is,
too.

17:39.529 --> 17:41.662
Now, what I don't
understand is

17:41.664 --> 17:43.564
why you haven't just
walked into town

17:43.566 --> 17:45.899
and killed him.

17:45.901 --> 17:47.434
<i>People will get</i>
<i>in the way.</i>

17:47.436 --> 17:48.869
Look, you want justice.

17:48.871 --> 17:50.871
You deserve justice.
But this isn't the way.

17:50.873 --> 17:52.739
We can put him on trial.
We can --

17:52.741 --> 17:54.241
<i>When he starts</i>
<i>killing</i> your <i>people,</i>

17:54.243 --> 17:55.910
<i>you can use</i>

17:55.912 --> 17:58.879
your <i>justice.</i>

17:58.881 --> 18:03.149
Isaac says he doesn't
care about my past,

18:03.151 --> 18:05.718
but things <i>may</i> have
been uncovered

18:05.720 --> 18:07.553
that even he might
struggle to forgive,

18:07.555 --> 18:09.555
so it's best we beat
a hasty retreat.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.593
"We"? I-I'm
coming with you?

18:13.595 --> 18:15.094
It's unlikely
the gunslinger

18:15.096 --> 18:16.595
will shoot,
if I'm with you.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.597
As far
as I can tell,

18:18.599 --> 18:20.466
he's programmed
to take innocent lives

18:20.468 --> 18:22.034
only if absolutely
necessary.

18:22.036 --> 18:24.704
Oh, well, color me
reassured.

18:26.607 --> 18:27.841
Doc.

18:30.679 --> 18:33.413
What are you
doin'?

18:34.883 --> 18:37.450
<i>No more</i>
<i>warning shots.</i>

18:37.452 --> 18:39.352
<i>I'll kill</i>
<i>the next person</i>

18:39.354 --> 18:40.921
<i>to step</i>
<i>over that line.</i>

18:40.923 --> 18:43.324
<i>Make sure</i>

18:43.326 --> 18:46.160
<i>it's Jex.</i>

18:54.537 --> 18:56.638
It was
stupid of me.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.040
I realize that now.
I just thought

18:59.042 --> 19:01.410
I'd put you all
in enough danger.

19:01.412 --> 19:02.778
Perhaps
if I left --

19:02.780 --> 19:04.780
He's lying!

19:04.782 --> 19:07.049
Every word.

19:07.051 --> 19:09.418
Everything he says.

19:09.420 --> 19:13.922
It's. All.

19:13.924 --> 19:15.090
Lies.

19:15.092 --> 19:16.892
This man is
a murderer.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.894
I am a scientist!

19:18.896 --> 19:21.330
Sit down.

19:21.332 --> 19:24.133
Sit down!

19:24.135 --> 19:25.668
Tell them
what you are.

19:25.670 --> 19:28.338
What am I?

19:28.340 --> 19:30.541
A war hero.

19:30.543 --> 19:33.578
O...kay,

19:33.580 --> 19:35.213
somebody want
to tell me

19:35.215 --> 19:37.582
what is goin' on?

19:37.584 --> 19:39.618
The gunslinger
is a cyborg.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.820
A what?
Half-man, half-machine.

19:41.822 --> 19:44.289
A weapon.
Jex built it.

19:44.291 --> 19:45.890
He and his team

19:45.892 --> 19:47.358
took volunteers,
told them

19:47.360 --> 19:49.861
they'd been selected
for special training,

19:49.863 --> 19:51.296
then experimented
on them,

19:51.298 --> 19:53.498
fused their bodies
with weaponry,

19:53.500 --> 19:54.899
and programmed them
to kill!

19:54.901 --> 19:57.969
Okay. Why?

19:57.971 --> 19:59.704
Why would you
do that, Doc?

19:59.706 --> 20:01.740
We'd been at war
for nine years.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.376
A war that had
already decimated

20:04.378 --> 20:06.512
half of our planet.

20:06.514 --> 20:09.081
Our task was
to bring peace

20:09.083 --> 20:11.317
and we did.

20:11.319 --> 20:13.619
We built an army
that routed the enemy

20:13.621 --> 20:15.921
and ended the war
in less than a week.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.489
Do you want me
to repent,

20:17.491 --> 20:18.924
to beg forgiveness

20:18.926 --> 20:20.392
for saving millions
of lives?

20:20.394 --> 20:21.560
And how many died
screaming

20:21.562 --> 20:23.128
on the operating table
before you had found

20:23.130 --> 20:24.596
your advantage?!

20:24.598 --> 20:26.398
War is
another world.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.500
You cannot apply
the politics of peace

20:28.502 --> 20:30.869
to what I did,
to what any of us did.

20:30.871 --> 20:32.370
But what
happened then?

20:32.372 --> 20:34.172
How come
you're here?

20:34.174 --> 20:36.041
When the war ended,

20:36.043 --> 20:37.676
we had the cyborgs
decommissioned,

20:37.678 --> 20:39.177
but one of them
must've got

20:39.179 --> 20:41.346
its circuitry
damaged in battle.

20:41.348 --> 20:44.582
It went offline
and began hunting down

20:44.584 --> 20:46.284
the team
that created it,

20:46.286 --> 20:48.319
until just two of us
were left.

20:48.321 --> 20:49.954
We fled

20:49.956 --> 20:53.691
and our ships
crashed here.

21:01.966 --> 21:06.136
So, what do we do
with Jex?

21:06.138 --> 21:07.638
What do we do
with him?

21:07.640 --> 21:09.340
Yeah. I mean,
he's a war criminal.

21:09.342 --> 21:11.442
No, he's the guy that saved
the town from cholera,

21:11.444 --> 21:13.044
the guy that gave us
heat and light.

21:13.046 --> 21:14.512
Look, Jex may be
a criminal

21:14.514 --> 21:16.014
and, yeah,
kind of creepy --

21:16.016 --> 21:17.683
And still
in the room.

21:17.685 --> 21:19.518
But I think we should
put aside what he did

21:19.520 --> 21:20.753
and find
another solution.

21:20.755 --> 21:22.254
Another solution?
It's him or us.

21:22.256 --> 21:23.722
When did we start letting
people get executed?

21:23.724 --> 21:24.923
Did I miss a memo?!
Doctor, tell him!

21:24.925 --> 21:26.758
Hmm?

21:26.760 --> 21:28.560
Yes.

21:28.562 --> 21:30.028
I don't know.

21:30.030 --> 21:31.463
Whatever Amy said.

21:31.465 --> 21:33.331
Looking
at you, Doctor,

21:33.333 --> 21:35.400
is like looking
into a mirror.

21:35.402 --> 21:36.568
Almost.

21:36.570 --> 21:39.604
There's rage there,
like me;

21:39.606 --> 21:42.841
guilt, like me;
Solitude --

21:42.843 --> 21:44.342
everything
but the nerve

21:44.344 --> 21:47.312
to do what needs
to be done.

21:47.314 --> 21:48.813
Thank the Gods
my people

21:48.815 --> 21:51.049
weren't relying on
you to save them.

21:51.051 --> 21:52.250
No.

21:52.252 --> 21:54.418
No! But these
people are!

21:54.420 --> 21:57.421
Out! Out! Out!

21:57.423 --> 21:58.522
Hmph!

22:00.892 --> 22:03.327
Oh, you're really
letting him do this?

22:03.329 --> 22:06.097
Save us all?
Yeah, I really am.

22:08.587 --> 22:09.854
Move!

22:09.856 --> 22:11.723
No, I --

22:11.725 --> 22:12.857
no!

22:12.859 --> 22:14.159
Move!

22:16.195 --> 22:17.629
What the
hell's goin' on?

22:23.136 --> 22:25.738
Over on that side!

22:29.143 --> 22:31.177
Hey!

22:31.179 --> 22:32.879
Ahh!

22:35.549 --> 22:37.417
You wouldn't.

22:39.987 --> 22:43.056
I genuinely
don't know.

22:43.058 --> 22:44.692
Doctor.

22:48.497 --> 22:51.699
Doctor.

22:51.701 --> 22:53.033
Aah!

22:53.035 --> 22:54.535
Let him come back,
Doctor!

22:54.537 --> 22:56.436
Or what?

22:56.438 --> 22:58.238
You won't
shoot me, Amy.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.739
How do you know?

22:59.741 --> 23:01.341
Maybe
I've changed.

23:01.343 --> 23:02.576
I mean, you've
clearly been taking

23:02.578 --> 23:04.310
stupid lessons
since I saw you last.

23:04.312 --> 23:06.079
Aah!

23:06.081 --> 23:07.214
I didn't mean
to do that.

23:07.216 --> 23:08.915
Everyone who isn't
an American,

23:08.917 --> 23:10.617
drop your gun.

23:10.619 --> 23:12.618
We can end this
right now.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.287
We could save
everyone right now!

23:14.289 --> 23:15.888
This is not how we roll,
and you know it.

23:15.890 --> 23:17.389
What's happened
to you, Doctor?

23:17.391 --> 23:18.890
When did killing someone
become an option?

23:18.892 --> 23:21.292
Jex has to answer
for his crimes.

23:21.294 --> 23:22.760
And what then, are you
going to hunt down

23:22.762 --> 23:24.228
everyone who's made a gun
or a bullet or a bomb?

23:24.230 --> 23:25.663
But they keep coming back.
Don't you see?

23:25.665 --> 23:27.098
Every time I negotiate,
I try to understand.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.466
Well, not today, no.

23:28.468 --> 23:29.900
Today, I honor
the victims first.

23:29.902 --> 23:31.335
His, the Master's,
the Daleks's,

23:31.337 --> 23:35.272
all the people who died
because of <i>my</i> mercy!

23:35.274 --> 23:37.140
See, this is
what happens

23:37.142 --> 23:39.542
when you travel alone
for too long.

23:39.544 --> 23:41.578
Well, listen to me,
Doctor --

23:41.580 --> 23:43.080
we can't be
like him.

23:43.082 --> 23:45.482
We have to be
better than him.

23:55.427 --> 23:56.594
Amelia Pond.

24:01.334 --> 24:02.767
Fine, fine!

24:02.769 --> 24:04.335
We'll think
of something else.

24:04.337 --> 24:07.137
But, frankly, I'm betting
on the gunslinger.

24:09.943 --> 24:11.108
Jex,

24:11.110 --> 24:13.678
move
over the line.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.013
<i>Now!</i>

24:29.663 --> 24:32.298
<i>Make peace</i>
<i>with your Gods.</i>

24:32.300 --> 24:34.968
<i>Kahler-Tek,</i>
<i>isn't it?</i>

24:34.970 --> 24:37.070
<i>I remember all your</i>
<i>names, even now.</i>

24:37.072 --> 24:39.639
Please,

24:39.641 --> 24:42.408
I'd never hurt
anyone again.

24:42.410 --> 24:44.544
I'm even helping
people here.

24:44.546 --> 24:46.045
<i>Last chance.</i>

24:46.047 --> 24:47.980
<i>Make peace</i>
<i>with your Gods.</i>

24:49.950 --> 24:51.050
No!

24:52.953 --> 24:54.720
Argh!
Isaac!

24:54.722 --> 24:56.021
Hey.

24:56.023 --> 24:58.757
Isaac?
Isaac! Isaac.

24:58.759 --> 25:00.960
It's okay.

25:00.962 --> 25:04.796
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>It's okay.</i>

25:04.798 --> 25:06.431
We can get you to Jex's
surgery. He can save you.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.634
Listen to me.

25:08.636 --> 25:11.403
You got to stay.

25:11.405 --> 25:13.206
You got to look
after everyone.

25:13.208 --> 25:14.907
It won't come
to that, Isaac.

25:14.909 --> 25:17.477
Protect Jex.

25:17.479 --> 25:19.078
Protect my town.

25:23.551 --> 25:28.487
You're
both good men.

25:28.489 --> 25:30.990
You just forget it
sometimes.

26:02.289 --> 26:04.458
Take
Jex to his cell.

26:04.460 --> 26:05.959
If anything
happens to him,

26:05.961 --> 26:07.461
you'll have me
to answer to.

26:10.499 --> 26:11.899
No!

26:16.071 --> 26:17.572

26:47.939 --> 26:50.440

I promised Isaac

Protecting him
got Isaac dead.

28:05.220 --> 28:07.087
Tomorrow, it's going to
get us all dead.

28:07.089 --> 28:08.622
We thought Isaac
was right to fight,

28:08.624 --> 28:11.492
but it's
different now.

28:11.494 --> 28:13.593
We got to say
"all right, we lost"

28:13.595 --> 28:16.496

28:16.498 --> 28:18.164
What it wants is
to kill our friend!

28:18.166 --> 28:20.400
We don't got
any ill feeling

28:20.402 --> 28:21.901
toward the doc,

28:21.903 --> 28:23.603
we just thinkin'
'bout our families.

28:23.605 --> 28:25.605
Hand him over and we
all safe again.

28:25.607 --> 28:28.841
You know
I can't do that.

28:28.843 --> 28:31.444
Then we got us
a problem.

28:37.217 --> 28:38.717
Please
don't do this.

28:38.719 --> 28:40.819
Why? Reckon you're

28:40.821 --> 28:42.287
Almost
certainly not.

28:42.289 --> 28:44.456
But this?
Lynch mobs?

28:44.458 --> 28:45.958
A town turning
against itself?

28:45.960 --> 28:47.693
This is everything
Isaac didn't want!

28:54.100 --> 28:56.068
How old are you?

28:56.070 --> 28:57.736
Nearly 19.

28:57.738 --> 28:59.205
That's 18, then.
You're too young

28:59.207 --> 29:00.706
to have fought in the
war, so I'm guessing

29:00.708 --> 29:02.208
you've never shot anyone
before, have you?

29:02.210 --> 29:04.677
First time
for everything.

29:04.679 --> 29:06.845
But that's how all
of this started.

29:06.847 --> 29:08.847
Jex turned someone
into a weapon.

29:08.849 --> 29:10.349
Now, that same story
is going to

29:10.351 --> 29:11.850
make you
a killer, too.

29:11.852 --> 29:13.284
Don't you see?

29:13.286 --> 29:14.719
Violence doesn't
end violence.

29:14.721 --> 29:16.487
It extends it.

29:19.324 --> 29:24.562
And I don't think
you want to do this.

29:24.564 --> 29:27.598
I don't think you want
to become that man.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.869
There's kids here.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.570
I know.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.339
Who I can save,
if you'll let me.

29:35.341 --> 29:38.910
He <i>really</i> worth
the risk?

29:38.912 --> 29:42.046
Don't know.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.414
But you are.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.808
Frightened people.

30:09.810 --> 30:11.576
Give me a Dalek,
any day.

30:28.341 --> 30:33.445
Fresh coffee,
Marshal.

30:33.447 --> 30:35.281
For what it's worth,

30:35.283 --> 30:36.949
I know you're
going to save us.

30:36.951 --> 30:38.984
Isaac made you marshal
for a reason

30:38.986 --> 30:41.053
and if you're
good enough for him,

30:41.055 --> 30:42.688
you're good enough
for me.

30:42.690 --> 30:46.893
Reckon you should
know that.

30:46.895 --> 30:48.861
Thank you.

30:56.570 --> 30:58.271
Oi!
Get out of here.

31:01.709 --> 31:03.577
Let me guess --

31:03.579 --> 31:05.812
the good folk of Mercy
wanted me to take

31:05.814 --> 31:09.049
a little stroll
into the desert.

31:09.051 --> 31:11.451
You could turn
a blind eye.

31:11.453 --> 31:14.087
No one would
blame you.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.623
You'd be a hero.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.091
But I can't,
can I?

31:18.093 --> 31:19.893
Because, then,

31:19.895 --> 31:21.328
Isaac's death
would mean nothing.

31:21.330 --> 31:25.466
Just another casualty in
your endless bloody war.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.802
Do you <i>want</i> me
to hand you over?

31:27.804 --> 31:28.937
Is that
what you want?

31:28.939 --> 31:30.705
Do you even know?!

31:30.707 --> 31:33.875
You think I'm unaffected
by what I did,

31:33.877 --> 31:35.343
that I don't hear
them screaming

31:35.345 --> 31:36.845
every time
I close my eyes?

31:36.847 --> 31:39.581
It would be
so much simpler

31:39.583 --> 31:41.449
if I was just one
thing, wouldn't it?

31:41.451 --> 31:43.384
The mad scientist

31:43.386 --> 31:45.520
who made that
killing machine,

31:45.522 --> 31:47.923
or the physician
who's dedicated his life

31:47.925 --> 31:49.424
to serving this town.

31:49.426 --> 31:52.160
The fact that I'm both
bewilders you.

31:52.162 --> 31:54.062
Oh, I know exactly
what you are

31:54.064 --> 31:57.399
and I see this reformation
for what it really is.

31:57.401 --> 31:59.167
You committed
an atrocity

31:59.169 --> 32:01.236
and chose this
as your punishment.

32:01.238 --> 32:02.771
Don't get me wrong.
Good choice.

32:02.773 --> 32:05.073
Civilized hours,
lots of adulation,

32:05.075 --> 32:06.608
nice weather,
but -- <i>but --</i>

32:06.610 --> 32:08.076
justice doesn't work
like that!

32:08.078 --> 32:09.577
You don't get to decide
when and how

32:09.579 --> 32:11.012
your debt is paid!

32:14.383 --> 32:15.317
Oof.

32:25.729 --> 32:29.332
In my culture,

32:29.334 --> 32:31.300
we believe that,
when you die,

32:31.302 --> 32:33.069
your spirit has to
climb a mountain,

32:33.071 --> 32:35.038
carrying
the souls of

32:35.040 --> 32:38.107
everyone you wronged
in your lifetime.

32:38.109 --> 32:42.278
Imagine the weight
I will have to lift.

32:42.280 --> 32:45.014

32:45.016 --> 32:46.515

they killed.

32:49.154 --> 32:51.521
Isaac!

32:51.523 --> 32:53.423
He was my friend.

32:53.425 --> 32:57.394
Now, his soul will be
in my arms, too.

32:59.464 --> 33:01.999
Can you see now
why I fear death?

33:09.709 --> 33:12.877
You want
to hand me over?

33:12.879 --> 33:14.812
There's no shame
in that.

33:14.814 --> 33:18.382
But you won't.

33:18.384 --> 33:21.318

<i>and the impossible.</i>

42:22.528 --> 42:27.164
<i>Where he came from</i>
<i>didn't matter.</i>

42:27.166 --> 42:29.967
<i>As a man once said,</i>

42:29.969 --> 42:33.738
<i>America is a "land</i>
<i>of second chances."</i>

42:36.742 --> 42:39.510
<i>Do I believe</i>
<i>the story?</i>

42:39.512 --> 42:41.612
<i>I don't know.</i>

42:41.614 --> 42:43.547
<i>My great-grandmother</i>
<i>must've been a little girl</i>

42:43.549 --> 42:45.783
<i>when he arrived.</i>

42:45.785 --> 42:47.852
<i>But next time</i>
<i>you're in Mercy,</i>

42:47.854 --> 42:50.823
<i>ask someone why</i>
<i>they don't have marshal</i>

42:50.825 --> 42:53.993
<i>or a sheriff</i>
<i>or policemen there.</i>

42:53.995 --> 42:56.596
<i>"We got our own arrangement,"</i>
<i>they'll say.</i>

42:56.598 --> 42:58.498
<i>Then they'll smile,</i>
<i>like they got a secret,</i>

42:58.500 --> 43:02.536
<i>like they got</i>
<i>their own special angel</i>

43:02.538 --> 43:04.038
<i>watching out for 'em.</i>

43:04.040 --> 43:05.579
<i>Their very own angel</i>
<i>who fell</i>

43:05.580 --> 43:07.314
<i>from the stars.</i>

43:16.140 --> 43:17.801
<i>Every time we flew away</i>
<i>with the Doctor,</i>

43:17.826 --> 43:19.520
<i>we'd just become</i>
<i>part of his life.</i>

43:19.620 --> 43:20.412
Come with me!

43:20.413 --> 43:22.516
But he never stood still long enough
to become part of ours.

43:23.414 --> 43:25.152
Except once.

43:25.156 --> 43:27.796
Haven't you seen them?
The year of the slow invasion.

43:27.978 --> 43:30.978
I've recommended we treat this
as a hostile incursion.

43:31.220 --> 43:34.780
There are soldiers all
over my house, and I'm in my pants!

43:34.780 --> 43:38.540
We have two lives.
Real life and Doctor life.

43:40.580 --> 43:42.620
Our best hope now is each other.

43:43.940 --> 43:45.780
What do we do?
Choose?
