00:11.645 --> 00:12.780
MAN (over P.A.):
All hands...

00:27.161 --> 00:29.830
Have you seen Petty Officer
Wassner this morning?

00:29.930 --> 00:31.765
Mm-mm.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.518
Female on deck.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.720
Petty Officer Wassner?

01:22.850 --> 01:24.452
Corpsman!

02:09.997 --> 02:11.799
Eh... 1:17.

02:11.899 --> 02:12.666
Whoo!

02:12.766 --> 02:15.203
Like lightning, baby.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.838
More like thunder.
All noise.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.274
Ha, ha. At least I shaved
a few seconds off.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.742
Good. You can lose a few more.

02:21.842 --> 02:25.679
All right,
what if I did a dash vault?

02:27.047 --> 02:28.516
Or kong.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.821
Since when are you able to do
choreography in a real chase?

02:33.921 --> 02:34.855
Huh?

02:34.955 --> 02:36.490
Let's just get it down to 1:10.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.292
Okay. But there's also
no stopwatch involved

02:38.392 --> 02:39.293
in a real chase either, so...

02:39.393 --> 02:41.895
It's not about the clock.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.632
Oh, man, I can feel it
in my spirit, here it comes,

02:44.732 --> 02:46.334
a Sam Hanna lesson.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.135
It's about the mentality.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.670
Let's say you're climbing
a mountain, right?

02:49.770 --> 02:51.272
And you reach the peak
only to realize

02:51.372 --> 02:52.406
there's a higher mountain.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.874
Do you stop?

02:53.974 --> 02:56.176
Or do you look to that
other mountain and say,

02:56.277 --> 02:57.378
"I got you next"?

02:57.478 --> 02:59.713
Yeah, keep moving the goalpost

02:59.813 --> 03:01.349
further down the field.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.850
No comfort in greatness.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.184
You make it
look pretty comfortable.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.221
Flattery will get you nowhere.
Yeah, well,

03:07.321 --> 03:09.122
it's worth a try.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.758
I think the kong will be faster.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.527
Knock yourself out.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.863
Hey, uh, can I ride with you?

03:15.963 --> 03:18.065
I'm not working today.

03:18.165 --> 03:21.502
Sam Hanna taking a day off?
What'd I miss?

03:21.602 --> 03:23.170
Hilarious. See ya.

03:23.271 --> 03:26.274
Yo, no, no, but really,
I-I rode with you, so...

03:26.374 --> 03:27.841
Don't you have a phone?

03:27.941 --> 03:30.143
Isn't there an app for that?

03:31.479 --> 03:33.981
App for your boss leaving you?

03:35.883 --> 03:38.652
♪ It's about to be
too late now ♪

03:38.752 --> 03:40.288
♪ To try to even get up... ♪

03:40.388 --> 03:42.790
Hey.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.827
Triple shot cortado
with a little oat milk,

03:46.927 --> 03:49.062
'cause I know
you care about the planet.

03:49.162 --> 03:50.364
Thanks.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.433
Grandpa's at Arkady's,
I took the day,

03:52.533 --> 03:53.867
so it's just me and you, hmm?

03:53.967 --> 03:56.504
You didn't have to do that.
Of course I did.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.744
Yeah?

04:03.844 --> 04:05.212
"Yeah?"

04:05.313 --> 04:06.580
I brought you coffee.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.449
I can't get a few minutes

04:08.549 --> 04:09.983
for a little
father-daughter chitchat?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.219
This midterm paper is
not gonna write itself.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.655
Well, then I'll help you,
just like old times.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.789
How about that?
That'd be great.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.459
Here is the, uh,
source material.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.394
Okay.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.196
<i>Teen Women's
Sexuality and Politics:</i>

04:23.297 --> 04:27.200
<i>A Case Study of
the Adolescent Female Body.</i>

04:27.301 --> 04:28.302
You got this.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.604
But you better be hungry
at noon,

04:30.704 --> 04:32.205
'cause I called in a favor
at Jake's.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.207
They're gonna put your favorite
sandwich on the menu.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.944
Dad, Hanna house rule number 17.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.212
Oh, so now you're quizzing me?
Mm-hmm.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.350
That's funny.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.617
Schoolwork comes first.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.118
Mm-hmm.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.955
No Jake's.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.726
Ooh!

04:52.826 --> 04:54.227
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
My sweatshirt.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.596
Ah, ah...
Okay, okay.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.130
All right.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.176
Oh, no, no, I got this.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.277
Okay.
Go do your paper.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.612
Do your paper,
do your paper.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.113
Dad?
Yeah?

05:13.213 --> 05:16.684
Thanks for the coffee
and, uh, offering to help.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.218
Don't mention it.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.187
Ride or die?

05:24.291 --> 05:25.426
Forever.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.161
All right, see ya.
All right, see ya.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.768
Hmm.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.510
Walk on the beach.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.478
Lunch at the pier.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.279
Very romantic.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.350
Uh-oh.
What?

05:50.451 --> 05:51.952
What was that?
What?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.587
That look.
What look?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.556
Mm... that look.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.124
There was no look.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.492
Oh, yeah?
So what would you call this?

05:58.592 --> 05:59.827
Okay.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.095
I did not do that.
Hey, I have a question.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.364
Um, do you have my address?
For what?

06:04.465 --> 06:05.666
For the wedding invitation.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.270
Looks like we've caught a case.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.972
Oh, did we? Hmm.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.007
After you,
I'll hold your train.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.078
Oh, no, please.
Let me.

06:18.178 --> 06:21.048
I've had enough of you.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.751
Hey, what have we got?

06:23.851 --> 06:26.086
This is Petty Officer
First Class Eli Wassner,

06:26.186 --> 06:28.856
electronics technician
on the USS <i>Allegiance.</i>

06:28.956 --> 06:32.292
He was found hanged this morning
in a hold on board.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.861
Hmm. Suicide?

06:33.961 --> 06:36.063
Unconfirmed,
but the <i>Allegiance</i> has had

06:36.163 --> 06:39.366
two suicides in recent months.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.301
SECNAV has tasked us

06:41.401 --> 06:44.905
with investigating to determine
if Wassner's a third.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.575
Uh, may I ask
why the NCIS Agent Afloat

06:47.675 --> 06:49.042
isn't handling this?

06:49.142 --> 06:52.713
That was our former guest,
Special Agent Lucy Tara.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.415
She has since returned to Honolulu,

06:55.516 --> 06:57.851
and the <i>Allegiance</i> is
in the process

06:57.951 --> 06:59.687
of being assigned
a new Agent Afloat.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.622
Got it.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.290
Did Wassner have,
uh, any family?

07:03.390 --> 07:06.927
He leaves behind a widow
in Los Angeles.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.596
His parents
and the rest of his family

07:08.696 --> 07:10.130
are in central New Jersey.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.733
Any history of depression
or any other mental illness?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.301
Not that I can find
any record of,

07:14.401 --> 07:16.103
but if he did,
he never sought treatment.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.472
History of gambling
or recent money losses?

07:18.572 --> 07:20.040
So far no red flags.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.976
Where the hell
are Callen and Sam?

07:24.177 --> 07:26.046
I won't ask again, Agent Blye.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.281
Um, I don't know, sir.
Why not?

07:28.381 --> 07:30.718
Um, they're both
using accrued leave,

07:30.818 --> 07:32.653
as per your orders, Admiral.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.887
I believe you told them both

07:33.987 --> 07:35.823
not to set foot in here
until next week.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.191
Have Agent Castor bring
Wassner's widow

07:38.291 --> 07:41.461
into the boatshed
to meet Deeks and Rountree.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.597
Maybe she has some insight

07:43.697 --> 07:45.799
as to what led to this.
Will do.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.702
Agents Blye and Namazi,
Santa Monica Airport.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.805
We'll get you a bird to
fly out to NAS North Island.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.373
Hopefully
the <i>Allegiance</i> can have

07:53.473 --> 07:55.676
a COD waiting there
to hop you out to the carrier.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.077
Copy that, sir.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.947
These suicides tend
to happen in clusters.

08:00.047 --> 08:03.517
The more exposure,
the more likely someone else

08:03.617 --> 08:05.719
is to see this as a way out.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.387
That's awful.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.956
It is,

08:09.056 --> 08:12.860
and that is three service
members dead in three months.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.995
I want answers.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.045
Stop.
What?

08:32.145 --> 08:34.682
Stop casing this place
like you're looking for

08:34.782 --> 08:37.517
an exit strategy
or weapons of opportunity.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.186
What are you talking about?

08:39.286 --> 08:41.589
Champagne?
Thank you.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.957
I'm actually...

08:44.057 --> 08:45.826
But why not?

08:45.926 --> 08:46.960
Thank you.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.129
"Saying no to champagne

08:49.229 --> 08:51.599
is like saying no to life."

08:52.499 --> 08:54.201
Yeah. That's better.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.436
Well,
it's from <i>The Deer Hunter.</i>

08:57.437 --> 08:58.572
Don't ruin this
for me, you know.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.640
We're supposed
to be celebrating.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.575
I'm celebrating. I'm just...

09:01.675 --> 09:03.043
I'm celebrating in here.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.679
You don't have to be here.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.314
I could have taken Fatima.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.983
No! No, I-- Come on,
I want to be here.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.351
Liar.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.787
I want to be here for you.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.157
I don't want you
to be here for me.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.659
I want you to be here for us.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.393
Right. I-I mean,
that's what I meant.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.996
For u-- To us.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.667
To us.
Mm-hmm.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.638
Actually tastes more
like prosecco.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.707
Please, you wouldn't know
prosecco from Pinocchio.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.476
Younger man, big nose,
woody complexion?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.478
Gets executed at the end, right?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.513
That's what happens
in the real story.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.115
It's true. Just...

09:42.215 --> 09:43.116
please stop talking.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.517
You, uh...

09:44.618 --> 09:46.620
You gonna drink
the rest of your prosecco?

09:59.232 --> 10:01.068
Thank you.
Thank you, Petty Officer.

10:01.969 --> 10:05.072
Master Chief Hughes.
XO tapped me to be your liaison.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.740
Nice to meet you.
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.541
This is Special Agent
Fatima Namazi.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.677
Hi.
We appreciate

10:09.777 --> 10:11.244
NCIS coming aboard.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.114
I'm sorry it's under
such unfortunate circumstances,

10:14.214 --> 10:16.216
but this matter seems
fairly straightforward.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.751
We understand.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.953
So, Petty Officer Wassner
was found here, in the hold?

10:20.053 --> 10:23.991
Yep. He was found right here
this morning

10:24.091 --> 10:25.693
at 0730.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.227
How did he hang himself?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.561
He used that spare line.

10:28.662 --> 10:31.531
Looks like he cut it free
with a pocket knife.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.034
Inspected it myself
this morning.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.036
We'd like to see the body.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.538
It was flown back to land
soon after he was discovered.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.675
Wassner is Jewish,

10:41.775 --> 10:43.610
and they bury their dead
as soon as possible.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.680
I'll have Shyla reach out
to the medical examiner.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.216
Yeah. Any idea why he did this?

10:51.351 --> 10:54.121
Maybe this will shed some light.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.824
It was found in his bunk
this morning.

10:56.924 --> 10:59.727
We should have this scanned
and sent to Shyla for analysis.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.929
Yeah. Does anyone else
know about this?

11:02.029 --> 11:06.133
Command, you and Chief
Kemi Adebayo who found him.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.667
We'd like to speak to her, please.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.870
Sure thing. Right this way.
Thank you.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.009
Hey, guys.
This is Robin Wassner.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.377
Thanks, Castor.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.946
Take a seat.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.680
Thank you so much
for-for coming in.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.716
We know
what you're going through is

11:22.816 --> 11:25.485
overwhelmingly difficult.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.054
What exactly do you need
from me?

11:27.154 --> 11:29.222
So, it's just a routine
investigation into the death

11:29.322 --> 11:31.191
of your husband
on the USS <i>Allegiance.</i>

11:31.291 --> 11:34.494
Just... you know, hoping
to get a better understanding

11:34.594 --> 11:36.363
of who Eli was

11:36.463 --> 11:37.798
and what he was
going through.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.199
Sure.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.534
Well, when's the last time
you spoke with him?

11:42.803 --> 11:44.604
Last Sunday
for our weekly phone call.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.273
Was there anything
that indicated

11:46.373 --> 11:48.141
he may have been struggling?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.478
Nothing.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.380
We laughed.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.048
Talked about him coming home.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.186
As far as I knew,
he was happy.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.955
We loved each other.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.191
We had just started
trying to have a child.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.359
We were really...

12:09.462 --> 12:11.498
I'm so sorry.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.837
Eli sent me letters.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.873
That was his thing.
Old-fashioned.

12:19.973 --> 12:23.043
I thought it was romantic.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.545
Even though I could barely read
his chicken scratch.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.981
When was his last letter?

12:28.816 --> 12:30.150
A couple weeks ago.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.352
You mind if we take
a look at those letters?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.554
Of course.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.123
Whatever you need.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.192
Thank you.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.596
Ah. Chief Kemi Adebayo.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.898
Agents.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.366
Uh, we won't take much
of your time.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.035
Please have a seat.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.769
I'd appreciate that.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.171
We are here to look into

12:51.271 --> 12:53.606
Petty Officer First Class
Eli Wassner's death.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.242
I'm aware.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.377
You were his direct supervisor.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.578
Affirmative.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.982
How would you describe
the working environment

13:02.082 --> 13:04.117
here on the USS <i>Allegiance?</i>

13:04.217 --> 13:05.785
Effective.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.989
We're aware of
the two complaints

13:09.089 --> 13:10.790
that were filed against you

13:10.891 --> 13:12.893
with the Inspector General.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.262
I don't fancy coddle culture.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.197
The minute you demand
this class of sailors

13:17.297 --> 13:20.000
to do their job,
you become the villain.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.136
Some would say that that is
a difficult working environment.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.873
I call it not being complicit
with mediocrity.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.607
Is this what you
thought of Wassner?

13:27.707 --> 13:29.476
As mediocre?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.979
He did good work.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.046
But?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.782
Lately he had become unfocused,

13:35.883 --> 13:37.617
and I told him to get
his act together.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.486
Hmm. Maybe you used words

13:39.586 --> 13:41.721
a little more aggressive
than that?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.924
It is my job to make sure
that we perform

13:44.024 --> 13:45.425
at the highest standards.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.428
If I spent every working hour
trying to decipher

13:48.528 --> 13:50.830
each sailor's emotional state,

13:50.931 --> 13:53.066
I'd never get anything done.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.835
I couldn't have known
he was unstable.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.571
Well, your team's well-being
is just as much part

13:58.671 --> 14:00.107
of your job
as their performance.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.475
I am well aware of
my job description.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.878
Okay, but if you...
Wassner is
the third sailor

14:04.978 --> 14:08.448
dead by apparent suicide
on this carrier.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.284
Maybe you need to take a hard
look at the way you operate.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.423
Wassner's medical records show
no alcohol abuse,

14:16.523 --> 14:19.359
no drug use
or any other mitigating factors.

14:19.459 --> 14:23.096
I mean, he has a spotless
discipline record

14:23.196 --> 14:25.798
and no unusual activity
on his financials.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.267
If Adebayo knew
he was struggling,

14:27.367 --> 14:29.269
she certainly didn't do
anything to help.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.438
About to go on leave,
start a family.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.141
I mean, this guy was
getting pressure from all sides.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.343
Which is why it's so weird
that his suicide note

14:36.443 --> 14:38.511
was so short and generic.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.380
Well, not everybody's a poet.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.751
Whoa. Castor just sent through
Robin's letters.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.786
Can you throw it up?
Yep.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.560
Whew. If that's
chicken scratch,

14:53.660 --> 14:55.228
then what would you call
my writing?

14:55.328 --> 14:58.131
Wow. He actually was
quite poetic.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.500
Yeah. This guy was
a real romantic.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.136
Wait, will you throw up
Wassner's suicide note?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.837
Yeah.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.476
Wait, something's
not right here.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.344
Okay, look at this.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.081
On "love,"
the O and the V are connected.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.783
Over here,
they're separated.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.052
And check this out,
on the I's,

15:19.152 --> 15:22.389
the dots are always
slightly to the back, right?

15:22.489 --> 15:25.058
But on the suicide note,
they're directly above the line.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.859
These were written
by two separate people.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.197
We got to get Shyla to get
forensics to verity this.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.066
If Wassner didn't write
his own suicide note...

15:33.166 --> 15:36.136
Then this just became
a murder investigation.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.248
Forensics analyzed
the letters from Wassner

15:48.348 --> 15:51.351
and confirmed Wassner
did not write his suicide note.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.353
It's a murder.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.854
I've been parsing the data

15:54.954 --> 15:57.590
on all crew
on the USS <i>Allegiance.</i>

15:57.690 --> 16:00.527
And as expected,
everyone is thoroughly vetted,

16:00.627 --> 16:03.263
and I don't see
any history of violence so far.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.832
What about civilians
or, uh, arriving crew?

16:05.932 --> 16:10.803
No visitors or new personnel
reported in the past 48 hours.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.740
Whoever did this is
stationed on board.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.675
Why stage this as a suicide?

16:15.775 --> 16:17.944
Why not just toss the body
off the side of the ship?

16:18.045 --> 16:20.680
'Cause a missing sailor triggers
an immediate investigation,

16:20.780 --> 16:22.649
whereas they gave us
a believable cause of death,

16:22.749 --> 16:24.184
they crossed their fingers

16:24.284 --> 16:26.419
and hoped we'd buy it.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.720
Especially with
all the recent suicides.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.722
It becomes a viable cover.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.558
Hey, guys.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.326
Here's Robin Wassner.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.295
Thanks, Shyla.
Of course.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.264
Hey, Robin,
thanks for coming back in.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.266
Agent Castor said
you had news for me.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.001
Uh, please. Um...

16:42.102 --> 16:43.403
Uh, I'm so sorry,

16:43.503 --> 16:45.372
'cause there is
no easy way to say this.

16:45.472 --> 16:49.176
Your husband's death is
now being investigated

16:49.276 --> 16:50.943
as a possible murder.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.915
Oh, my God.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.950
And I know that's hard to hear,

16:58.051 --> 17:00.387
but I promise you,
we're gonna find who did this

17:00.487 --> 17:02.855
and we're gonna put 'em away.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.857
But we need your help.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.228
Do you know anyone who might
have wanted to hurt Eli?

17:08.328 --> 17:10.363
No, no one.

17:11.131 --> 17:15.168
What about his supervisor,
Chief Adebayo?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.204
She seems like a tough woman.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.439
Tough? No, she's lovely.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.275
Uh, have you...
have you met her?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.711
I didn't need to.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.914
This wasn't the first time
that Eli and I were

17:28.014 --> 17:30.183
going to try for a baby.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.784
Last year, we were pregnant,

17:31.884 --> 17:34.053
but, a few months in,
I had a miscarriage.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.355
I'm sorry.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.923
Adebayo fought for us.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.258
She pushed

17:38.358 --> 17:40.127
Eli's leave request through,
called in favors,

17:40.227 --> 17:42.462
whatever she could do to get him
a couple of days home with me.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.896
That's amazing.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.832
Eli didn't even ask
for her help.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.500
She overheard him
talking to another sailor,

17:47.600 --> 17:48.935
and she took the initiative.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.470
It was...

17:50.570 --> 17:52.772
the nicest thing
anyone has ever done for us.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.841
Yeah.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.883
Hey.
Hey.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.353
So, that was Shyla.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.555
Wassner didn't write
his suicide note.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.957
We're looking at murder.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.826
Okay. Murder.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.795
You think Adebayo was involved?

18:15.895 --> 18:18.698
Uh, no,
she was cleared, completely.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.467
The other chiefs
in her bunk said

18:20.567 --> 18:22.502
she was in bed all night long.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.804
And, last year,
she took it upon herself

18:24.904 --> 18:26.739
to help the Wassners
in their time of need,

18:26.839 --> 18:29.842
and she has
a stellar promotion record.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.413
I don't know
how I got this woman so wrong.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.848
Hey, emotions were running high, okay?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.417
And she was not easy
to talk to.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.452
No, I know,
but I let her personality

18:39.552 --> 18:42.622
cloud my judgment
and guide our interview.

18:42.722 --> 18:43.990
We could've had an ally.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.726
Don't beat yourself up.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.998
We need to find out
what she knows.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.501
And I need to apologize.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.570
Hey, since we can't go out,

18:57.670 --> 18:59.372
I'm-a make Mom's
famous meatloaf for dinner.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.673
Mmm. That'd be nice.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.509
Want to invite Josh?

19:03.743 --> 19:05.712
No, it's okay.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.147
You sure?
He must be missing you.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.617
I'm sure he's fine.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.253
Everything okay between you two?

19:13.353 --> 19:15.288
Yeah.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.156
We're not hanging out anymore.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.192
Did something happen?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.594
We just got busy
with our own things.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.363
It's no big deal. Oh.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.531
When did that happen?

19:24.631 --> 19:26.899
I don't know,
a few months ago.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.967
Months?

19:28.067 --> 19:29.569
I had no idea.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.504
No one told me anything.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.406
Nothing to say, really.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.874
You sure?

19:34.974 --> 19:37.544
You know, I'm here to talk
about anything you want.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.412
I know.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.649
Gramps.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.684
Ooh, I got to get back
to my paper.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.287
Dad, what's wrong?

19:48.388 --> 19:51.391
Because you only call me
when something's wrong.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.727
No, I cannot bring over
the pickleball paddles.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.863
But tell Arkady
I know he sold that necklace,

19:56.963 --> 19:59.699
so he can afford to pick up
his own damn pickle paddles.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.870
I am so, so sorry
to have kept you waiting.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.706
Tara Walker,
and you must be Anna...

20:06.806 --> 20:08.207
Hi.
...and Grisha?

20:08.308 --> 20:09.576
Uh, you can call me Callen.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.743
Callen.
Yeah, great.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.945
Fatima has told me all about

20:13.045 --> 20:16.015
your upcoming nuptials, congratulations.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.285
Thank you.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.519
Now, marriage

20:19.619 --> 20:21.388
is between two people.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.724
I truly believe that it takes
both of your involvement

20:24.824 --> 20:27.527
to achieve the perfect
expression of your love.

20:27.627 --> 20:30.897
So, what have you come up with
so far?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.434
Well, we've been talking
a lot about it.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.969
I bet. It's exciting,
isn't it?

20:37.069 --> 20:38.971
Yes,
and a bit overwhelming.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.341
Which is exactly
where I come in.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.210
So give me the broad strokes.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.414
Honey?

20:47.514 --> 20:49.882
Honey?
Mm-hmm.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.784
Uh, yeah, well,
l-like she said,

20:51.884 --> 20:53.653
we've been talking
about it a lot.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.254
Um...

20:55.355 --> 20:56.856
We don't have a theme.

20:57.624 --> 20:58.958
A theme?

20:59.759 --> 21:00.827
It's a thing.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.796
Like, what kind of a thing?

21:03.896 --> 21:05.332
What, like a Western theme?

21:05.432 --> 21:06.599
Cowboy boots and line dancing?

21:06.699 --> 21:09.101
People have themes, right?

21:09.201 --> 21:10.437
Absolutely.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.305
No, we never talked about
having a theme.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.274
Which is why I said,
"We don't have a theme."

21:15.375 --> 21:17.410
Let's take a step back.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.112
In terms of a venue,

21:20.212 --> 21:22.782
what do you see
as the most important element?

21:22.882 --> 21:25.318
Security.
Presentation.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.920
You weren't
at Kensi and Deeks' wedding.

21:28.020 --> 21:32.258
I assure you whatever
we settle on will be very safe.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.428
Do you have
an officiant in mind?

21:35.528 --> 21:36.929
Nah, we're pretty secular.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.698
Well, actually,
my father expressed interest

21:38.798 --> 21:39.932
in becoming ordained

21:40.032 --> 21:42.234
in order to
perform the ceremony.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.736
How special.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.072
It's becoming more and more
common to have a friend

21:46.172 --> 21:49.576
or family member do so,
and it adds such a heartfelt

21:49.676 --> 21:51.310
and personal element

21:51.411 --> 21:52.512
to the ceremony. Yeah.

21:52.612 --> 21:53.880
Arkady?

21:54.781 --> 21:56.649
It would mean a lot to him.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.785
Arkady?

21:59.852 --> 22:02.689
Do you have somebody else
in mind?

22:03.490 --> 22:04.724
Anybody else.

22:04.824 --> 22:05.958
I have an idea.

22:06.058 --> 22:09.396
This is a fun little exercise

22:09.496 --> 22:13.666
that allows everyone to express
what is most important to them.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.168
As long as we're
not graded on it.

22:16.268 --> 22:17.804
There are no right
or wrong answers,

22:17.904 --> 22:19.772
just follow your hearts.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.208
I'll give you a few minutes
to yourselves.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.012
You know,
it's not too late to elope.

22:26.112 --> 22:29.015
Just answer
the damn questions.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.624
Ah, Chief Adebayo.
Thank you for coming back.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.291
Uh, please have a seat.

22:39.392 --> 22:42.161
Uh, look, we got off
on the wrong foot

22:42.261 --> 22:45.465
earlier, and I really wanted to
apologize to you.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.199
Stop right there.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.837
You were right.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.906
Wassner was under my charge.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.209
His well-being,
my responsibility,

22:57.309 --> 22:59.178
and I should've stepped in
to help.

22:59.278 --> 23:02.048
Maybe he wouldn't have
taken his own life.

23:02.148 --> 23:05.552
Look, I-I appreciate that, Chief.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.488
It's just we now believe
that Wassner was murdered.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.291
Murdered? What?

23:12.391 --> 23:13.426
I'm sorry.

23:16.429 --> 23:19.699
After we spoke,
I did some digging.

23:19.799 --> 23:23.335
I wanted to know
why Wassner did this.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.705
I mean, I asked around.

23:25.805 --> 23:28.641
Did anyone see Wassner
last night?

23:28.741 --> 23:31.343
No, but Ensign Choi,

23:31.444 --> 23:33.446
he saw the sailor
on roving watch

23:33.546 --> 23:36.783
heading down the passageway
just adjacent to the hold

23:36.883 --> 23:38.585
around 0100.

23:38.685 --> 23:39.686
Do you have a name for us?

23:39.786 --> 23:41.187
Bradshaw.

23:41.988 --> 23:42.989
Bradshaw.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.123
Uh, thank you so much.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.592
That was incredibly helpful.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.026
Unless there's something else,

23:47.126 --> 23:48.394
I would like to
get back to my team.

23:48.495 --> 23:49.529
Please, thank you.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.268
Okay.

23:56.368 --> 23:59.271
Bradshaw may have been the last
person to see Wassner alive.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.974
Okay, I'm checking the list of
all the, uh,

24:02.074 --> 24:04.977
after-hours watches that
Master Chief Hughes gave us.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.847
Anything?
I'm not seeing a Bradshaw
on roving watch.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.849
Okay, well, that part of
the ship is restricted

24:09.949 --> 24:11.584
to essential personnel only
at that time.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.520
So, there's no reason
for Bradshaw to be there.

24:13.620 --> 24:14.854
Exactly.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.257
What if Bradshaw was
following Wassner?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.794
All right.
You know what?

24:21.894 --> 24:23.730
Uh, find Master Chief Hughes

24:23.830 --> 24:25.565
and have him get Bradshaw
delivered to us.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.204
Agent Blye,
what do you got?

24:32.304 --> 24:34.073
We have a potential suspect, sir.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.608
Last name Bradshaw.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.877
Seen in the same passageway
as Wassner last night.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.479
Already confirmed
he was not on roving watch.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.581
Great work.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.282
And we've got
something for you.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.117
The autopsy isn't complete yet,

24:45.217 --> 24:46.686
but I was able to
talk the medical examiner

24:46.786 --> 24:50.222
into sending over a report
on the exterior of the body.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.524
And?

24:51.624 --> 24:53.459
Time of death between 2:00
and 3:00 a.m.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.062
Ligature marks around the neck,
which overlay a faint,

24:56.162 --> 24:57.997
ovoid bruising pattern.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.432
Wait, so he didn't die
from being hanged?

25:00.533 --> 25:05.171
No, he died with someone's
hands around his throat.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.552
Petty Officer Dennis Bradshaw.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.821
Home of record:
Morris, Alabama,

25:21.921 --> 25:24.090
where his wife still resides.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.558
Financials?

25:25.658 --> 25:27.827
Uh, checking account
with his wife,

25:27.927 --> 25:32.498
but he also has a separate
account with $50,000 in it.

25:32.599 --> 25:35.267
Safe to assume
she has no clue.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.870
Well, that's more than
just saving for a rainy day.

25:37.970 --> 25:42.575
No, all transactions in and out
of that account were in cash.

25:42.675 --> 25:45.244
Hmm, so they can't be traced.
Could be illegal revenue.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.179
Find Bradshaw right now.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.715
Already on it, sir.

25:48.815 --> 25:51.517
What else do we know about
Petty Officer Bradshaw?

25:51.618 --> 25:53.319
He was on leave
three months ago.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.087
His paperwork cites his address
in Alabama,

25:55.187 --> 25:57.857
but I'm not seeing
any record of him flying there.

25:57.957 --> 26:01.493
So, he didn't go home
to visit his wife.

26:01.594 --> 26:03.362
No, but his phone pinged
multiple times

26:03.462 --> 26:04.731
in San Pedro, California

26:04.831 --> 26:06.599
at a business called
The Brass Boot.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.334
The Brass Boot is owned

26:08.434 --> 26:11.203
by Rondel Fryer,
former Navy,

26:11.303 --> 26:13.539
administrative discharge
in 2010.

26:13.640 --> 26:14.841
Any criminal history?

26:14.941 --> 26:16.843
After his discharge,
he got busy.

26:16.943 --> 26:20.346
Investigated for tax evasion,
fraud and money laundering

26:20.446 --> 26:22.148
but no convictions.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.652
Any connections past or present
to foreign entities?

26:25.752 --> 26:27.053
Funny you should ask.
I am seeing

26:27.153 --> 26:30.122
incoming money transfers
and frequent phone calls

26:30.222 --> 26:33.425
from an individual in China,
still pinpointing those.

26:34.226 --> 26:38.064
Wassner's position
as an electronics technician

26:38.164 --> 26:43.169
gave him access to classified
radar and ship system data.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.472
Maybe Bradshaw was
selling Wassner's intel

26:46.572 --> 26:48.507
to this Rondel guy,

26:48.607 --> 26:50.409
somehow the deal went bad,

26:50.509 --> 26:52.578
and then Bradshaw
confronted Wassner.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.647
Uh-huh. Well,
that tracks with

26:54.747 --> 26:57.016
a heat-of-the-moment
strangulation.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.519
If Bradshaw was
leaking Wassner's data

27:00.619 --> 27:02.154
to a civilian
with ties to China...

27:02.254 --> 27:04.857
Then the integrity of our Navy
could be compromised.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.059
Keep tracing those calls,
Agent Dahr,

27:07.159 --> 27:10.496
and send Deeks and Rountree
to that, uh, Brass Boot.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.331
You got it. Oh.

27:12.431 --> 27:13.866
Oh?
Uh...

27:13.966 --> 27:17.169
Rondel has three handguns
and several long guns

27:17.269 --> 27:18.838
registered in his name.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.841
And he's a semipro MMA fighter.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.677
How far out is Agent Hanna
from that location?

27:24.777 --> 27:28.114
15 minutes,
same as Deeks and Rountree.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.549
Send him, too.
Day off be damned.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.651
Yes, sir.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.691
What'd you put
for question eight?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.827
You're still on eight?

27:40.927 --> 27:42.394
I'm taking my time with this.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.163
Yeah, right.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.431
Did you put C?

27:45.531 --> 27:47.433
I'm not telling you.
Why not?

27:47.533 --> 27:49.401
Because you can't cheat.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.103
This isn't a test.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.740
Oh, trust me, this is a test.
Come on, show me what you put.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.442
Show me what you put!
No. Get lost.

27:56.542 --> 27:57.643
Okay, fine. Yeah.

27:57.744 --> 27:58.945
But just so we're clear,
you know,

27:59.045 --> 28:00.179
if we can't share
on something like this...

28:01.513 --> 28:03.049
D? You put D?

28:03.149 --> 28:04.016
Just give it to me.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.317
What, is it a Russian thing?

28:14.626 --> 28:16.462
I see you made it to work.

28:16.562 --> 28:17.764
Where's Deeks?

28:17.864 --> 28:19.431
Got called away
to a deposition.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.867
Kilbride knows. Okay.

28:20.967 --> 28:23.002
How's your day been
with the first

28:23.102 --> 28:25.171
future woman president
of America?

28:25.271 --> 28:27.874
Sequestered away in her room
working on a paper.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.876
Tolerating me at best.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.710
She's probably just focused.
You know what?

28:31.811 --> 28:33.645
I remember
when Jordan was her age,

28:33.746 --> 28:36.015
and I used to--
Let's check it out.

28:39.251 --> 28:42.388
Place needs a sweep,
but I'd have a drink here.

28:42.488 --> 28:45.124
I wouldn't.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.030
Sorry, gents,
we don't open till 5:00 p.m.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.065
Federal agents.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.280
Don't make me shoot you!

29:13.585 --> 29:15.287
Nice moves.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.688
Thanks.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.190
Should've thrown in
a kong vault, though.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.492
You know what I mean?
Maybe a dash.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.529
All right.

29:23.629 --> 29:26.232
Point taken.
Let's go.

29:27.699 --> 29:31.703
Oh! Um,
everything okay in here?

29:32.504 --> 29:34.273
Yes.
Perfect.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.542
How did we make out on the...
All done.

29:36.642 --> 29:39.245
And this was, uh...
this was very helpful.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.213
Super helpful. Thank you.
It was great.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.482
We got a thing we got to get to,
and we're kind of late, so...

29:43.582 --> 29:44.984
Thanks,
we'll be in touch.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.153
Thank you.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.155
Okay.

29:55.394 --> 29:58.297
Oh, there you are,
I've been looking for you.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.933
Where's Bradshaw?
He was in some kind of
heavy machinery accident

30:01.033 --> 30:02.301
up on the flight deck.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.735
He was rushed to the trauma room
in the sick bay.

30:03.836 --> 30:04.770
Is he conscious?

30:04.871 --> 30:06.138
I'm not sure what state he's in.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.908
Okay, we'll find out.
Thank you. Thanks.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.877
Sit down.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.180
Why would you run
from federal agents?

30:14.280 --> 30:16.382
What do you guys got going on
in here?

30:16.482 --> 30:19.485
I thought you were the IRS
coming to harass me again.

30:19.585 --> 30:22.922
We tried to tell you we're NCIS.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.359
Has this man been in here?

30:29.561 --> 30:31.230
I'm not at liberty to say.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.599
That's a yes.
He's been selling you

30:33.699 --> 30:35.267
classified Navy intel.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.169
Classified intel?

30:37.269 --> 30:40.139
Yeah.
That's ridiculous, no.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.840
Either you tell me
something I don't know

30:41.941 --> 30:43.509
or the two of you are gonna
spend a lot of time

30:43.609 --> 30:45.811
in prison together for the
murder of a Navy petty officer.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.746
Murder?
Murder.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.950
Okay.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.786
This isn't just a bar.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.722
There's a room in the back
that I run

30:56.822 --> 30:59.258
as a private club
and safe space.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.927
Safe for who?

31:01.027 --> 31:02.861
Mostly military guys,

31:02.962 --> 31:05.097
some higher profile
Hollywood types.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.234
People who don't want
their private lives

31:08.334 --> 31:09.735
to affect their careers.

31:09.835 --> 31:10.769
What are you talking about?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.338
Different generation, kid.

31:12.438 --> 31:15.074
Not quite as accepting
as you X, Y, Z's.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.842
Hmm.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.610
Like a gay speakeasy?

31:18.710 --> 31:21.647
I prefer to think of myself
as more of a guardian angel

31:21.747 --> 31:23.782
than an emcee,

31:23.882 --> 31:25.351
but sure.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.986
Come on, man, it's 2023.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.754
Why not just go to a gay bar?

31:28.854 --> 31:31.523
Well, times have changed
but not for everyone.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.725
Maybe you're less likely
to get beaten in the streets,

31:33.825 --> 31:36.062
but how many
gay global action stars

31:36.162 --> 31:38.097
do you see starring
in Hollywood movies?

31:38.197 --> 31:39.265
Hmm.

31:39.365 --> 31:40.666
Fair point.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.734
Okay, then if you're
not working with Bradshaw,

31:42.834 --> 31:44.270
then what's up
with the phone calls

31:44.370 --> 31:46.005
and the financial transactions
coming out of China?

31:46.105 --> 31:48.507
Coming out of Chi...

31:50.176 --> 31:53.745
My twin brother
teaches English in China.

31:53.845 --> 31:57.416
I-I gave him a loan to help him
through a rough patch.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.486
He wires me money to pay me back
every month.

32:02.088 --> 32:05.824
L-Look, I didn't kill anyone.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.260
All I'm trying to do here

32:08.360 --> 32:10.762
is let some people
be who they are

32:10.862 --> 32:12.464
without any judgment.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.103
Rondel does, in fact,
have a twin,

32:17.203 --> 32:20.439
Brian Fryer, who lives in China
teaching English.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.874
And despite his history
with the IRS,

32:22.975 --> 32:26.578
The Brass Boot is
completely aboveboard.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.115
If Bradshaw is gay,

32:29.215 --> 32:31.450
maybe he and Wassner were
having an affair.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.586
And then one of them
threatens to come out

32:34.686 --> 32:36.155
before the other is ready.

32:36.255 --> 32:39.758
And there's a fight,
and Bradshaw strangles Wassner.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.531
Kensi?

32:45.631 --> 32:46.598
No, it's Fatima.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.400
Hughes said Bradshaw was injured

32:48.500 --> 32:50.202
on the flight deck,
and now he's in the sick bay.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.970
Kensi's trying to figure out
what happened.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.972
Well, that sounds
awfully coincidental.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.541
Do you have witnesses?

32:55.641 --> 32:57.209
No, we don't know yet.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.278
Petty Officer Dennis Bradshaw.

32:59.378 --> 33:01.813
He was hurt
in the flight deck accident.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.753
Hold on, looks like
we're getting some bad news.

33:07.853 --> 33:09.388
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.757
So, was Bradshaw killed?

33:11.857 --> 33:13.425
No. He's not even hurt.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.894
Sick bay is empty.
There was no accident at all.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.030
What?
Master Chief Hughes lied to us.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.499
Okay, why would he do that?

33:23.001 --> 33:25.037
He's protecting Bradshaw.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.872
But that only makes sense if...

33:26.972 --> 33:30.376
Hughes and Bradshaw are working together.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.044
Find them.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.292
Okay, so, we know
that Bradshaw is gay,

33:46.392 --> 33:48.294
and that Hughes lied
to protect him.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.062
Is it possible...

33:50.162 --> 33:51.463
That they're a couple?

33:51.563 --> 33:52.964
I don't see why not.

33:53.065 --> 33:56.668
But where does Wassner
factor into all of this?

33:57.903 --> 34:00.439
Well, maybe he knew about
the relationship,

34:00.539 --> 34:02.941
and he threatened to out them.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.179
Jalen! Jalen, open the door!

34:07.279 --> 34:09.581
Jalen!

34:10.416 --> 34:12.351
Move!
Jalen, open the door!

34:12.451 --> 34:14.286
Jalen!
Bradshaw.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.721
Please, please help him. Please.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.323
Does he have a weapon?

34:17.423 --> 34:19.291
Yeah, a gun.
He's gonna hurt himself.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.592
Please help him.
Okay, okay.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.728
Okay.

34:22.828 --> 34:26.031
Master Chief Hughes,
it's NCIS.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.933
We're gonna come in, okay?

34:38.710 --> 34:40.246
Master Chief Hughes.

34:40.346 --> 34:43.182
Will you please
hand me the gun?

34:45.217 --> 34:47.286
Jalen.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.955
Jalen, I love you.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.824
Don't do this.

34:55.994 --> 34:58.764
I didn't mean to hurt Wassner.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.067
It was an accident.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.971
It was an accident. Okay.

35:06.071 --> 35:07.639
Okay.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.908
Too many years living in shame.

35:10.008 --> 35:12.478
You couldn't hold it all back forever.

35:25.457 --> 35:29.828
I am so...

35:31.363 --> 35:33.399
...tired.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.741
I'm sorry.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.884
I'm sorry.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.066
<i>According to Bradshaw,
there was no indication</i>

36:08.166 --> 36:10.436
that Wassner was gonna tell
anybody that they were gay.

36:10.536 --> 36:13.339
He just got scared
when Master Chief Hughes

36:13.439 --> 36:16.975
tried to bribe him with a
recommendation for a promotion.

36:17.075 --> 36:19.478
He wanted to report the bribe,
now he's dead.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.380
I guess I understand
the complexity

36:21.480 --> 36:23.315
of not being out
on the ship,

36:23.415 --> 36:24.716
but-- thank you--

36:24.816 --> 36:25.751
you'd think they'd be able
to be honest

36:25.851 --> 36:27.152
with their own family.

36:27.953 --> 36:30.489
Sometimes the hardest people
to talk to are family.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.460
Well, now that you mention it,
that's absolutely true.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.963
Exhibit A: Roberta Deeks.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.235
Yeah.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.770
My little sister's
my only family,

36:44.870 --> 36:46.372
and I know
she don't tell me everything.

36:46.472 --> 36:48.507
Hmm.
And vice versa.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.008
You know, it's...

36:50.108 --> 36:52.010
Even when you want to,
I think it's human nature.

36:53.144 --> 36:55.113
Yeah.
It's mind-blowing.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.348
You know?

36:56.448 --> 36:58.016
That Master Chief Hughes
would go as far

36:58.116 --> 37:01.453
as trying to use a promotion
in order to keep Wassner quiet

37:01.553 --> 37:04.022
about seeing him
kiss another guy.

37:04.122 --> 37:05.357
Doesn't make sense.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.058
1991.

37:07.158 --> 37:10.262
That's the year
that Hughes enlisted.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.998
20 years between then

37:13.098 --> 37:15.200
and the end of
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell."

37:16.902 --> 37:21.673
You have any idea
how many servicemen were beaten,

37:21.773 --> 37:23.575
assaulted,

37:23.675 --> 37:26.545
killed during that time?

37:26.645 --> 37:29.180
I don't 'cause that
didn't get reported.

37:29.281 --> 37:33.452
But somewhere north of 100,000
got discharged.

37:34.286 --> 37:37.222
Hughes is from a different time. Yeah.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.791
I, uh...

37:39.891 --> 37:42.193
I don't very often find a reason

37:42.294 --> 37:45.331
to compliment
the younger generation,

37:45.431 --> 37:47.966
but one of the few things
you all got right was

37:48.066 --> 37:51.169
that you're not afraid
of someone

37:51.269 --> 37:54.205
just because they're
different than you.

37:54.306 --> 37:57.843
Might not understand them,
but you're not afraid of them.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.245
Hmm.

38:01.313 --> 38:05.551
Yeah, I don't know, Deeks still
freaks me out a little bit.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.659
Wow, way to kill a moment.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.761
Exceptions to every rule.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.073
Hey.
Hey.

38:28.173 --> 38:30.409
There's a meatloaf
in the oven for you.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.210
You made dinner?

38:32.310 --> 38:33.512
Yeah.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.914
Smells good. Thanks.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.884
How's the paper going?

38:38.984 --> 38:42.554
It's going, I think.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.289
I don't know.

38:46.124 --> 38:49.528
You know,
I had always hoped that...

38:49.628 --> 38:51.897
me and your mom created
an empathetic environment

38:51.997 --> 38:53.532
for you and Aiden.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.967
Wanted to make sure
you never felt like

38:56.067 --> 39:00.572
our compassion was conditional.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.409
Yeah, of course.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.276
What brought this on?

39:07.379 --> 39:09.515
You're gonna really make me
do this?

39:09.615 --> 39:11.483
Do what?

39:11.583 --> 39:13.452
Kam?

39:13.552 --> 39:15.721
Dad?

39:20.225 --> 39:24.730
I already knew
that you broke up with Josh,

39:24.830 --> 39:26.898
and that you were seeing
someone else.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.038
And that someone else
might be a woman.

39:41.780 --> 39:42.948
Did Aiden tell you?

39:43.048 --> 39:45.083
You told Aiden before me?

39:45.183 --> 39:47.853
I didn't tell him,
he kind of just found out.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.955
Kam, you know I would
never turn my back on you,

39:50.055 --> 39:51.056
no matter what.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.459
I got you.
I know that.

39:53.559 --> 39:57.328
So, why didn't you tell me?
It's not that simple.

39:58.296 --> 40:02.033
I liked the guys I dated
before, I think.

40:02.133 --> 40:05.103
A-And I'm with a woman now,
so it's different.

40:05.203 --> 40:07.272
And that doesn't mean I'll never
have feelings for a guy again,

40:07.372 --> 40:10.275
or maybe it does,
I don't know.

40:13.645 --> 40:14.680
I didn't want to tell you

40:14.780 --> 40:17.082
until I figured it out for me.

40:21.252 --> 40:25.156
Kam, you're smart,
you're beautiful.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.593
You're caring,
you're courageous.

40:27.693 --> 40:30.228
You're outspoken.

40:31.329 --> 40:34.399
And who you date is
never gonna change any of that.

40:35.701 --> 40:38.036
You'll always be the Kam I love.

40:40.472 --> 40:42.541
Come here.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.176
Come here.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.848
I love you.
Love you, too.

40:52.117 --> 40:55.487
All that matters is
that you're happy.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.258
Does she make you happy?

41:00.358 --> 41:03.361
Yes. She does.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.463
What's her name?

41:05.564 --> 41:07.933
Riley.
Riley.

41:10.902 --> 41:14.139
Well, does this Riley have
a 4.0 GPA,

41:14.239 --> 41:16.875
work with multiple charities

41:16.975 --> 41:18.744
and have
a prestigious internship

41:18.844 --> 41:20.111
lined up for the summer?

41:20.211 --> 41:22.681
I wouldn't settle
for anything less.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.850
Ride or die.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.485
Forever.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.896
You hungry, right?
Yes.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.698
Okay, I'll get you
some meatloaf.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.533
Thank you.
