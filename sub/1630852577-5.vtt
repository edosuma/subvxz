00:06.103 --> 00:08.068
Previously
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

00:08.068 --> 00:10.896
You'll produce
tension-grabbing super teases.

00:10.896 --> 00:12.413
Action.

00:12.413 --> 00:15.241
This is not RuPaul's
Southern Hospitality Race!

00:15.241 --> 00:16.689
I need love!

00:16.689 --> 00:19.689
You stupid bitch,
what are you doing to me?

00:21.275 --> 00:22.448
Kerri Colby.

00:22.448 --> 00:26.000
Let your guard down.
Just get ugly.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.379
Alyssa Hunter.

00:27.379 --> 00:30.896
Every response was
ai-yi-yi-yi.

00:30.896 --> 00:33.275
Angeria, I believed
every word you said.

00:33.275 --> 00:34.275
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

00:36.310 --> 00:39.965
Kerri Colby, shantay you stay.

00:39.965 --> 00:42.413
Alyssa Hunter, sashay away.

00:51.758 --> 00:55.689
Whew. It feels so nice
to breathe, y'all.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.931
-Yes, ma'am.
-Oh.

00:57.931 --> 01:01.241
Alyssa just got told
to go home, honey.

01:01.241 --> 01:02.517
She didn't have
the golden ticket.

01:02.517 --> 01:04.068
Willy Wonka didn't pop up
outta nowhere.

01:04.068 --> 01:06.068
The chocolate bar
sent the girl packing.

01:06.068 --> 01:10.275
"Believe in yourself,
perrasss, your Latina queen."

01:10.275 --> 01:12.758
-Oh!
-Miss Alyssa!

01:12.758 --> 01:14.965
We love you!

01:14.965 --> 01:16.206
Miss Kerri, you killed it.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.137
In your Versace.

01:18.137 --> 01:20.482
If you're gonna do it,
you gotta do it right I guess.

01:20.482 --> 01:21.758
I'm really not too excited

01:21.758 --> 01:22.931
with where I've been
in this competition.

01:22.931 --> 01:25.206
I want to be
a strong player here.

01:25.206 --> 01:27.310
Let me go ahead
and do a little scrub, honey.

01:27.310 --> 01:28.758
Yes!

01:28.758 --> 01:31.206
Nah, you scrubbing too pretty,
bitch, too pretty.

01:31.206 --> 01:35.206
Aah!

01:36.655 --> 01:39.586
Is that what y'all wanted?

01:39.586 --> 01:40.965
I know what the judges
wanna see now.

01:40.965 --> 01:43.241
So if they want monster
and they want scary Kerri,

01:43.241 --> 01:46.931
they about to get scary
motherfucking Kerri. Period.

01:46.931 --> 01:48.241
Well, I know
how Angie's feeling.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.896
-Oh, yes!
-$5,000 richer!

01:53.241 --> 01:55.655
Bitch, it's the most money
I done ever had at one time.

01:55.655 --> 01:57.137
Bitch, I'm like, girl!

01:57.137 --> 01:59.586
Miss Angeria's putting
the points up on the board,

01:59.586 --> 02:02.241
so right now
she is the one to beat.

02:02.241 --> 02:03.896
I need to amp it up.

02:03.896 --> 02:05.241
I need to be
putting those points up.

02:05.241 --> 02:06.310
I need a W.

02:06.310 --> 02:07.758
How do you feel,
Miss Kornbread?

02:07.758 --> 02:10.103
How you feel, Miss Bread?

02:10.103 --> 02:11.965
Um, I'm good. It's just
I'm one of those people,

02:11.965 --> 02:13.344
I'm hard on myself,

02:13.344 --> 02:15.862
and I do feel like
there is more that I can do.

02:15.862 --> 02:20.137
I was not expecting to be
in the bottom three, honestly.

02:20.137 --> 02:21.965
And I'm feeling
very vulnerable right now,

02:21.965 --> 02:23.379
but it's a competition,

02:23.379 --> 02:27.379
so I'm just trying not
to let nobody see me weak.

02:27.379 --> 02:29.655
-You feeling all right?
-Yeah, I'm good.

02:29.655 --> 02:32.137
I'm good. I just need a reset,
that's all.

02:32.137 --> 02:33.379
Yeah.

02:33.379 --> 02:35.758
Get my spirit together,
all that goodness.

02:37.206 --> 02:41.000
I do feel like I have
some redemption to do now.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.310
I have not won
any maxi-challenges yet,

02:44.310 --> 02:46.655
and I want to!

02:46.655 --> 02:48.068
I want to!

02:48.068 --> 02:49.724
Time to release the ginger.

02:49.724 --> 02:51.000
Look, I was ready to do so.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.172
Look.
I had sparkle panties.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.620
She was ready to do so!

02:54.620 --> 02:56.896
I was ready to do so!

02:56.896 --> 02:59.068
But I need to find a way
to really pop

02:59.068 --> 03:00.413
in this
next week's challenge.

03:00.413 --> 03:04.448
I have a lot more
cheeky sparkle to give,

03:04.448 --> 03:05.655
so they better watch out.

03:10.689 --> 03:12.517
The winner
ofRuPaul's Drag Race

03:12.517 --> 03:14.034
receives a one-year supply

03:14.034 --> 03:16.482
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

03:16.482 --> 03:21.586
and a grand prize of $100,000,
powered by Cash App.

03:21.586 --> 03:24.241
With extra-special
guest judge Ava Max.

03:34.793 --> 03:37.448
Yes, good morning,
everybody, good morning.

03:37.448 --> 03:39.586
It is a new day in the werkroom,

03:39.586 --> 03:41.275
and you never know
what's in store,

03:41.275 --> 03:42.931
so it's always
a little hootenanny.

03:43.931 --> 03:45.172
Yeah, a hootenanny.

03:45.172 --> 03:46.689
You know, a little,
like, a good time.

03:46.689 --> 03:48.344
You know, like you never know
what's gonna happen.

03:50.275 --> 03:52.862
Girls, wait, wait.

03:52.862 --> 03:54.206
Where's Kornbread?

03:54.206 --> 03:55.655
What's happening?

03:55.655 --> 03:56.724
Yeah, you guys,
where's Kornbread?

03:56.724 --> 03:58.000
-Girl, what?
-Oh, my God.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.482
Wait, did she leave?

04:00.482 --> 04:01.586
What is going on?

04:01.586 --> 04:05.103
Hey, dolls.

04:05.103 --> 04:08.275
RuPaul walks out, and we're
all a little bit shook,

04:08.275 --> 04:10.586
not understanding
what's going on.

04:10.586 --> 04:15.103
Ladies, as you may have noticed,
Kornbread isn't here today.

04:15.103 --> 04:18.344
She wanted to share
this message with you.

04:19.896 --> 04:21.275
Hey, girls.

04:21.275 --> 04:23.586
So you're probably wondering
why I'm not there.

04:23.586 --> 04:26.379
During last week's challenge,
the acting challenge,

04:26.379 --> 04:28.965
I rolled my ankle, and when
I went home and I went to sleep,

04:28.965 --> 04:31.448
I woke up
in excruciating pain,

04:31.448 --> 04:34.068
and my ankle
was extremely swollen.

04:34.068 --> 04:36.620
I saw a doctor,
and the doctor gave me orders

04:36.620 --> 04:40.344
to stay off of my feet
for six to eight weeks.

04:40.344 --> 04:44.310
So unfortunately, this is
the end for me in Season 14.

04:47.482 --> 04:49.310
I'm gobsmacked.

04:49.310 --> 04:52.689
I had no idea Kornbread
had an injury last week.

04:52.689 --> 04:56.344
I really feel devastated.

04:56.344 --> 04:59.103
Miss Kerri,
keep fighting, honey.

04:59.103 --> 05:00.965
Keep showing them
how gorgeous you are,

05:00.965 --> 05:02.931
and you can be a monster,
too, girl.

05:02.931 --> 05:04.551
I've seen you when you wake up
in the morning.

05:04.551 --> 05:07.965
Jasmine Kennedie,
baby, just listen.

05:07.965 --> 05:09.862
Ain't no hard feelings
over here.

05:09.862 --> 05:13.413
And I know you gonna talk
enough for the both of us.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.793
And lastly,
my good buddy Willow.

05:16.793 --> 05:19.517
You make sure you take care
of yourself first.

05:19.517 --> 05:21.862
You continue to have fun
and keep being weird,

05:21.862 --> 05:24.896
and throw them damn flip-flops
in the trash.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.482
As much as I'm, like,
here to beat these queens

05:30.482 --> 05:32.310
and win this competition,

05:32.310 --> 05:35.931
the friendships
matter the most to me.

05:35.931 --> 05:38.793
And Korn...

05:38.793 --> 05:41.827
and Kornbread's friendship

05:41.827 --> 05:44.310
mattered the most to me
out of anyone's.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.965
For now, the bakery is closed.

05:46.965 --> 05:48.517
But look on the bright side.

05:48.517 --> 05:50.620
Y'all might actually have
a chance at winning the crown

05:50.620 --> 05:52.689
now that I'm gone.

05:52.689 --> 05:54.482
Bye.

05:54.482 --> 05:57.551
And don't cry for me,
Miss Argentina.

05:57.551 --> 05:59.689
Love you, girl!

05:59.689 --> 06:01.068
Damn.

06:01.068 --> 06:03.862
Kornbread was
a really strong competitor.

06:03.862 --> 06:05.689
I saw her at the very top.

06:05.689 --> 06:08.620
So as much as I hate
to see her go,

06:08.620 --> 06:10.482
there's a small inkling of me

06:10.482 --> 06:13.551
that's like, okay, we got one
of the good bitches outta here.

06:13.551 --> 06:16.137
In case any of you
were wondering,

06:16.137 --> 06:19.758
Kornbread did not have
the gold candy bar,

06:19.758 --> 06:21.827
so it's still in play.

06:21.827 --> 06:24.793
And let this be
a reminder to everyone.

06:24.793 --> 06:27.103
Savor every moment
you have here.

06:27.103 --> 06:29.206
Now, I have a question for you.

06:29.206 --> 06:31.793
Are you willing to do
whatever it takes

06:31.793 --> 06:34.551
to become America's
next drag superstar?

06:34.551 --> 06:35.551
-Yeah!
-Yes!

06:35.551 --> 06:37.310
I hope you mean it.

06:40.379 --> 06:42.068
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

06:42.068 --> 06:43.724
Yes!

06:43.724 --> 06:45.275
Oh, my gosh.

06:45.275 --> 06:47.862
To randomly divide you
into three teams,

06:47.862 --> 06:52.344
you need to do some dirty
dancing with the Pit Crew.

06:52.344 --> 06:53.655
-Oh!
-Oh!

06:53.655 --> 06:56.379
I've been waiting
for this one.

06:56.379 --> 06:59.068
Now, first you'll choose
the balloon

06:59.068 --> 07:02.172
and place it between you
and the Pit Crew.

07:02.172 --> 07:06.793
Then you'll bump and grind
until your balloon pops.

07:07.965 --> 07:09.758
If you know what I mean.

07:09.758 --> 07:11.172
Sounds fun!

07:11.172 --> 07:13.103
The color of the confetti
inside your balloon

07:13.103 --> 07:16.068
will determine
which team you join.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.689
Y'all ready to bump and grind?

07:17.689 --> 07:19.137
-Yes!
-Yes!

07:21.724 --> 07:24.448
I'm feeling very excited.

07:27.103 --> 07:28.931
Excited.

07:31.379 --> 07:36.000
All right, let's go left
to right, starting with Bosco.

07:38.965 --> 07:40.275
Don't worry, baby.

07:40.275 --> 07:42.517
In Seattle, we call this
the Space Needle bump.

07:42.517 --> 07:45.310
Oh!

07:45.310 --> 07:47.448
That was so quick.

07:47.448 --> 07:49.000
Bosco, you're on the green team.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.068
Up next, Jasmine Kennedie.

07:51.068 --> 07:54.034
-Oh!
-You're on the purple team.

07:54.034 --> 07:56.448
Oh, my God, you got it
all over his back.

07:57.551 --> 07:59.379
Up next, DeJa Skye.

08:01.655 --> 08:02.758
Boom!

08:05.517 --> 08:07.275
Pop it.

08:07.275 --> 08:08.931
Ugh!

08:08.931 --> 08:11.793
Bruno, I think
you need to push back.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.241
Now, that's the definition
of a power bottom.

08:17.241 --> 08:19.793
Thank you, DeJa.
You are orange.

08:19.793 --> 08:21.931
All right, up next.

08:21.931 --> 08:23.310
Oh, boy.

08:28.103 --> 08:31.034
You signed up for anything
to win that $100,000, missy,

08:31.034 --> 08:33.965
anything and everything.

08:40.793 --> 08:43.344
Maddy, you're on
the purple team.

08:43.344 --> 08:44.448
Purple.

08:44.448 --> 08:46.413
Kerri Colby.

08:46.413 --> 08:48.275
Yes.

08:48.275 --> 08:50.034
Orange team.

08:50.034 --> 08:51.586
Willow Pill.

08:53.310 --> 08:54.724
Put your hip into it!

08:54.724 --> 08:57.551
Daya Betty and Lady Camden,

08:57.551 --> 08:59.206
you're on the green team.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.517
Jorgeous.

09:00.517 --> 09:02.206
Bend those knees, Bryce!

09:02.206 --> 09:03.931
Five, six, seven, eight. Aah!

09:03.931 --> 09:08.206
It's the screaming.
Aah! Aah! Aah!

09:10.241 --> 09:13.344
Oh, my God,
Jorgeous is a chihuahua

09:13.344 --> 09:14.827
yapping at someone's ankles.

09:14.827 --> 09:17.379
She's like, "Ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah."

09:17.379 --> 09:19.689
Ah! Ah!

09:22.137 --> 09:24.827
That little bitch ain't
topped nothin' in her life.

09:24.827 --> 09:26.551
Ah! Ah!

09:26.551 --> 09:30.482
"Ah, ah, ah!"

09:33.689 --> 09:36.758
Push that tush!
Push that tush!

09:36.758 --> 09:37.862
I'm just a little girl!

09:39.517 --> 09:41.862
-You are orange.
-Finally, girl.

09:41.862 --> 09:44.758
Angeria, Orion,
for the final round,

09:44.758 --> 09:46.379
let's make it a four-way.

09:46.379 --> 09:47.517
-Ooh!
-Okay.

09:48.793 --> 09:51.379
Ooh, we got the DP now:

09:51.379 --> 09:52.517
double pop.

09:52.517 --> 09:55.413
One, two, three, go!

09:55.413 --> 09:58.206
-Oh!
-No, wait a minute.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.172
No, wait a minute.
Hold on. I got you.

10:03.137 --> 10:07.241
Oh, my goodness, 10s, 10s,
10s across the board!

10:07.241 --> 10:10.724
Now, ladykins, just being chosen

10:10.724 --> 10:12.758
to compete
on RuPaul's Drag Race

10:12.758 --> 10:16.172
is a proud accomplishment,
but it's not easy

10:16.172 --> 10:19.103
being the first queen
to get the chop.

10:19.103 --> 10:23.172
And if you don't believe me,
just ask them.

10:23.172 --> 10:26.896
Please welcome the first queen
eliminated from Season 7,

10:26.896 --> 10:28.172
Tempest DuJour.

10:36.586 --> 10:38.241
Is this me in 25 years?

10:38.241 --> 10:39.689
She's got my shirt on.

10:39.689 --> 10:42.931
Now, the first queen
eliminated from Season 9,

10:42.931 --> 10:45.310
Jaymes Mansfield.

10:47.482 --> 10:49.172
Hey! Oh, my God.

10:49.172 --> 10:53.000
And the first queen
eliminated from Season 13,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.448
Kahmora Hall.

10:57.655 --> 10:59.206
From the Haus of Hall.

10:59.206 --> 11:00.689
Yes, the Haus of Hall!

11:00.689 --> 11:03.241
We were all rooting for you!

11:03.241 --> 11:06.137
Now, queens, for this week's
maxi-challenge,

11:06.137 --> 11:09.000
you need to create
a public service announcement

11:09.000 --> 11:12.379
for the Save a Queen
organization.

11:14.137 --> 11:17.689
Founded just five minutes ago
in my dressing room.

11:17.689 --> 11:20.000
Save a Queen's mission

11:20.000 --> 11:24.137
is to raise awareness
of first-eliminated queens

11:24.137 --> 11:27.517
who feel overlooked,
underestimated,

11:27.517 --> 11:31.517
and just a little bit
constipated.

11:31.517 --> 11:34.827
Now, each team
has to tell the story

11:34.827 --> 11:37.586
of one of these legendary ladies

11:37.586 --> 11:40.137
in the form of
a personality-driven,

11:40.137 --> 11:42.172
rhyming commercial parody.

11:42.172 --> 11:44.275
Team Orange,
you get Tempest DuJour.

11:45.310 --> 11:47.482
Come on, over, sis!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.965
Team Purple,
you get Jaymes Mansfield.

11:51.965 --> 11:54.068
Come on over here, sis!

11:55.655 --> 11:57.310
Oh!

11:57.310 --> 12:00.827
That means Team Green,
you get Kahmora Hall.

12:00.827 --> 12:03.137
I promise I won't be late.

12:03.137 --> 12:04.724
We're putting you
in drag for this.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.862
Racers, start your engines,

12:06.862 --> 12:09.275
and may the best drag queen win.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.103
Coming up...

12:12.103 --> 12:15.620
I am not excited about
this challenge whatsoever.

12:15.620 --> 12:20.034
How are you going to infuse
your ideas into this challenge?

12:20.034 --> 12:22.586
I definitely think I have to be
more ditzier and more cutesier.

12:25.103 --> 12:26.068
Start packing now.

12:33.206 --> 12:36.413
-Let's get to work.
-Get to work, ladies.

12:36.413 --> 12:37.448
Hello, hello, I'm Bosco.

12:37.448 --> 12:39.344
Yes, Camden!

12:39.344 --> 12:41.413
Who the hell are you people?

12:41.413 --> 12:43.103
For today's maxi-challenge,

12:43.103 --> 12:47.137
we are creating a PSA
for our fallen sisters

12:47.137 --> 12:49.724
that have gone home first
in their seasons.

12:49.724 --> 12:51.448
The key to doing well
in this challenge

12:51.448 --> 12:55.793
is that it has to be fun,
dripping with sincerity,

12:55.793 --> 12:59.482
and there has to be a way
for you to stand out.

12:59.482 --> 13:00.862
We're not singing, right?

13:00.862 --> 13:02.275
It's just spoken.

13:02.275 --> 13:03.965
No, this is, like,
did you know every single day

13:03.965 --> 13:06.275
there is a cow
that is currently in pain?

13:06.275 --> 13:07.827
We've all seen those
commercials, right?

13:07.827 --> 13:09.275
They try to make you cry.

13:09.275 --> 13:11.931
When you get that commercial
of some shaky-leg dog,

13:11.931 --> 13:15.758
and it's just barely
crawling into existence,

13:15.758 --> 13:17.172
barking like, roo-roo-roo-roo.

13:17.172 --> 13:20.241
Yeah, it's just gonna be...
money.

13:20.241 --> 13:21.655
We're not here to play.

13:21.655 --> 13:24.068
We are here to slay, right?

13:24.068 --> 13:26.413
We're gonna send those two
Hobbits back to The Shire.

13:28.689 --> 13:31.000
So we have to tell
a funny story about me.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.655
Let me tell you what Drag Race
audiences know me for.

13:34.655 --> 13:36.034
This bitch called me old.

13:36.034 --> 13:37.689
So how old are you?

13:37.689 --> 13:39.275
Ooh!

13:39.275 --> 13:40.689
Really?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.137
Anything we can riff on,
I think, about age,

13:44.137 --> 13:46.724
like, Shady Pines
Retirement Community

13:46.724 --> 13:48.758
or her joints are crackin'.

13:48.758 --> 13:50.103
If dragging her through the mud

13:50.103 --> 13:51.724
is what's gonna win
this challenge,

13:51.724 --> 13:53.896
then, baby,
we about to drag this ho.

13:53.896 --> 13:55.137
It has to rhyme.

13:55.137 --> 13:56.448
Yeah, and that's the easy part,

13:56.448 --> 13:57.965
because it's really
just like

13:57.965 --> 13:58.931
dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah.

13:58.931 --> 13:59.931
dah-dah-dah-dah.

13:59.931 --> 14:01.517
It's that simple, right?

14:01.517 --> 14:07.000
Honestly, I'm not excited
about this challenge whatsoever,

14:07.000 --> 14:10.655
because I hate anything
that has to do with me talking.

14:10.655 --> 14:11.689
Like, and I'm not good
at rhyming.

14:11.689 --> 14:13.931
Oh, poor Tempest DuJour.

14:13.931 --> 14:16.103
They shipped her off
to Shady Pines.

14:16.103 --> 14:18.965
I feel like it doesn't rhyme.

14:18.965 --> 14:20.206
Well, no, this next verse
is gonna rhyme.

14:20.206 --> 14:21.413
Oh. Oh, yeah.

14:21.413 --> 14:22.551
So poor Tempest DuJour,

14:22.551 --> 14:23.689
they shipped her off
to Shady Pines,

14:23.689 --> 14:25.241
dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.

14:25.241 --> 14:27.379
I'm laying everything out
on the table for these girls.

14:27.379 --> 14:29.413
Now it's in your hands.

14:29.413 --> 14:31.068
I have given you the clay.

14:31.068 --> 14:33.689
Now, make a beautiful vase
out of it for us.

14:33.689 --> 14:35.620
Tempest DuJour
was the cat in the hat

14:35.620 --> 14:38.137
who firstly got told
she was old by a rat.

14:38.137 --> 14:39.862
Can we be meaner
about Kandy, though?

14:42.689 --> 14:44.551
I think what we should do
is have four topics

14:44.551 --> 14:46.275
that are quintessential
Jaymes things.

14:46.275 --> 14:47.620
Okay, so what do you think

14:47.620 --> 14:50.068
are your biggest downfalls
of your time?

14:50.068 --> 14:51.689
If you don't mind
reliving your trauma.

14:51.689 --> 14:52.965
Okay, okay.

14:52.965 --> 14:54.827
My downfall was
a cheerleading challenge.

14:58.827 --> 15:00.758
I think we have
a lot to work with here.

15:00.758 --> 15:02.793
I'm known for styling
the worst wigs around.

15:02.793 --> 15:04.413
Oh, maybe we could use that.

15:04.413 --> 15:06.241
Say something about how, like,
giving wigs second chances,

15:06.241 --> 15:07.551
and, like, we should
give her a second--

15:07.551 --> 15:09.034
you know, she deserves
a second chance.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.172
That's a good way to go, yeah.

15:10.172 --> 15:11.413
I think it's funnier
if we say, like,

15:11.413 --> 15:14.310
throw some nickels
at this busted-ass pig.

15:14.310 --> 15:17.241
Please, someone throw some money
to this busted-ass pig.

15:17.241 --> 15:19.724
-I like that. Yeah.
-Yeah.

15:19.724 --> 15:23.344
Her cheap, homemade costumes...

15:23.344 --> 15:25.724
is what sent her home
or something like that.

15:27.172 --> 15:28.586
Hmm.

15:28.586 --> 15:32.517
Orion, start packing now.

15:32.517 --> 15:35.793
I do feel like I'm contributing
a lot of, like, the ideas,

15:35.793 --> 15:38.000
and I feel like Willow
is also helping refine,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.793
and I feel confident
in what we're bringing.

15:39.793 --> 15:42.103
But I'm a little iffy
about some of the other girls.

15:42.103 --> 15:45.172
Don't worry. With our group,
we're all writing.

15:45.172 --> 15:47.137
With Kahmora's, one's writing

15:47.137 --> 15:48.275
and the others
have to do her makeup.

15:51.344 --> 15:53.344
Hey, squirrel friends.

15:53.344 --> 15:55.793
-Hi!
-Hey!

15:55.793 --> 15:58.068
Are you accepting donations?

15:58.068 --> 16:00.034
-Yeah!
-All the time.

16:00.034 --> 16:01.724
-Good.

16:01.724 --> 16:03.793
All right, green team,
come on over.

16:03.793 --> 16:05.517
Hi!

16:05.517 --> 16:07.241
I wanna know how you all
are gonna treat our Kahmora,

16:07.241 --> 16:10.482
because it's a combination
that we're being funny,

16:10.482 --> 16:12.448
we're being shady,
but not mean.

16:12.448 --> 16:15.206
I think it's important to show
that Kahmora is in on the joke.

16:15.206 --> 16:17.172
Are you ready for this, Kahmora?

16:17.172 --> 16:19.586
I'm rooting for them, yes.

16:19.586 --> 16:22.379
Say it the way you were supposed
to say it on your season.

16:22.379 --> 16:23.551
I'm rooting for them!

16:25.931 --> 16:27.551
-No.

16:27.551 --> 16:30.586
Girl.

16:30.586 --> 16:32.275
Now, Lady Camden,
do you have a cause

16:32.275 --> 16:34.206
that's near and dear
to your heart?

16:34.206 --> 16:36.275
I mean, a serious cause?

16:36.275 --> 16:38.758
Because if you apply
that same seriousness to this,

16:38.758 --> 16:40.034
it will be funny.

16:40.034 --> 16:42.206
I don't have one
super serious to my heart,

16:42.206 --> 16:45.068
but I do feel like
this has to be infused

16:45.068 --> 16:48.379
with something that we really
believe is genuinely sad.

16:48.379 --> 16:50.206
Yes, that's what I just said.

16:51.758 --> 16:53.413
She's not from here, Ru.

16:54.655 --> 16:57.344
I was trying to
get out of that question.

16:57.344 --> 17:02.965
Now, all three of you
have not been in the top.

17:02.965 --> 17:06.137
How are you going
to make this challenge

17:06.137 --> 17:10.206
a top-getting challenge?

17:10.206 --> 17:12.793
I feel like we're just gonna
channel our love for tops

17:12.793 --> 17:16.068
and love for topping
into bringing this.

17:16.068 --> 17:17.724
I think it just
needs to be funny.

17:17.724 --> 17:19.448
I started really, really strong.

17:19.448 --> 17:22.241
I haven't been in the top,
though,

17:22.241 --> 17:27.413
so my energy going into this
is stand out.

17:27.413 --> 17:30.034
I need to start putting points
up on that board.

17:30.034 --> 17:32.000
So I will see you out there.
Go make me laugh.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.413
Thanks, Ru. Thank you.

17:33.413 --> 17:35.896
All right, purple ladies.

17:35.896 --> 17:37.655
Hey, doll.

17:37.655 --> 17:40.034
Jaymes, what has your life been
like since you were here last?

17:40.034 --> 17:41.310
It's been great.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.896
I honestly have
gotten to do so much

17:42.896 --> 17:45.172
that I never thought I could do,
even though I went home first.

17:45.172 --> 17:47.793
Like, I got to tour the world,
I got to start my own business.

17:47.793 --> 17:49.137
I couldn't be more grateful.

17:49.137 --> 17:51.620
Are they calling prostitution
a business now?

17:51.620 --> 17:53.448
It's the oldest trade
in the book.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.758
So I see you have a storyboard.

17:54.758 --> 17:57.551
How far along
have you guys come?

17:57.551 --> 17:59.000
We really have, like, all, like,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.517
the ideas and the scenes
we wanna do.

18:00.517 --> 18:02.517
It's just fleshing out
the final details.

18:02.517 --> 18:04.724
Orion, are you familiar
with this kind of PSA?

18:04.724 --> 18:06.724
Have you seen
the Sarah McLachlan thing?

18:06.724 --> 18:09.827
Yes, and I always turn it off
because it always makes me sad.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.137
Well, how are you gonna
make this happy and fun?

18:13.965 --> 18:17.517
I think that we...

18:17.517 --> 18:20.000
Have you ever done anything
like this before?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.275
I haven't.

18:21.275 --> 18:22.931
When you're doing
these challenges,

18:22.931 --> 18:24.862
behavior is everything.

18:24.862 --> 18:28.172
You know, who is your character?
You know what I mean?

18:28.172 --> 18:30.482
And that adds so much flavor.

18:30.482 --> 18:34.551
Ru loves the classic PSAs,
and I'm a little bit worried

18:34.551 --> 18:39.896
about everyone on my team
fully grasping those characters.

18:39.896 --> 18:41.448
You kids make me laugh.
Be funny.

18:41.448 --> 18:43.793
And Jaymes,
welcome back, darling.

18:43.793 --> 18:45.724
Thank you. I'm stealing
everything in here.

18:49.689 --> 18:52.068
All right, team orange,
come on over.

18:52.068 --> 18:55.068
-Hi!
-Hellur.

18:55.068 --> 18:58.275
So how do you plan on using
our Tempest DuJour?

18:58.275 --> 19:01.586
We're capitalizing off the fact
that she's a old bitch.

19:01.586 --> 19:03.827
Oh, okay.
So due to the fact--

19:03.827 --> 19:06.068
-Due to the fact--
-That she old...

19:06.068 --> 19:08.379
And honey,
I don't mean no more.

19:08.379 --> 19:11.448
So, Tempest, is anything
off-limits for you?

19:11.448 --> 19:14.724
Have you told them, oh, no,
I'll do anything for drag,

19:14.724 --> 19:15.931
but I won't do that?

19:15.931 --> 19:17.517
No. Well, no,
actually, the opposite.

19:17.517 --> 19:21.034
I've told them let's be meaner,
let's dig deeper.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.965
The key to these challenges

19:22.965 --> 19:25.793
is that you can't give away
the joke in your eyes.

19:25.793 --> 19:30.000
You have to read this
as if it were the gospel truth.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.551
Then it's automatically funny.

19:32.551 --> 19:34.620
You're doing this
for a really good cause.

19:34.620 --> 19:35.724
-Yeah.
-I mean, Tempest DuJour.

19:37.655 --> 19:41.758
She needs our thoughts
and our prayers.

19:41.758 --> 19:43.896
-Desperately.
-Yes.

19:43.896 --> 19:46.586
So now, Jorgeous, you have
this fire on the runway.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.655
How will you translate that
into this challenge?

19:49.655 --> 19:51.068
I definitely think
I have to be more ditzier,

19:51.068 --> 19:53.068
more cutesier with this.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.448
-Ditzier and cutesier?
-Yes.

19:54.448 --> 19:55.724
Okay.

19:55.724 --> 19:57.137
-Cutesier.
-Uh-huh.

19:57.137 --> 19:59.310
Kerri, what does that mean?

19:59.310 --> 20:01.379
I've been trying to figure
that out since I got here.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.379
I'm nervous as hell.

20:05.379 --> 20:07.689
Back home, people that I know

20:07.689 --> 20:09.206
tell me, like, "Girl, you're
not gonna be good at acting,

20:09.206 --> 20:10.965
you're not gonna be good
at the funny stuff."

20:10.965 --> 20:14.206
I cannot wait
to see what you all do.

20:14.206 --> 20:17.896
It just really sticks
in my head, like...

20:21.206 --> 20:22.551
Coming up...

20:22.551 --> 20:24.689
You're gonna be late!
You're gonna be late!

20:26.344 --> 20:29.896
The queens were challenged
to bring their best Gaga.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.448
It was so, like, The Count
from Sesame Street.

20:32.448 --> 20:36.965
I could confidently say...
I did really well.

20:44.758 --> 20:47.413
Hey, welcome, queens.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.379
It's time to shoot our PSA
with Michelle Visage,

20:50.379 --> 20:52.793
and honestly, I am
shitting bricks right now.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.862
Tempest, I am so happy
to see you.

20:55.862 --> 20:57.655
I'm so happy to see you, too!

20:57.655 --> 20:59.379
And you're naked again!

20:59.379 --> 21:01.034
Oh, my God.

21:01.034 --> 21:04.241
Now, I'm just acting
as a second pair of eyes.

21:04.241 --> 21:06.793
I'm here to help,
but you kids are in charge.

21:06.793 --> 21:09.000
So the first thing
we're gonna do

21:09.000 --> 21:11.448
are your rhyming lines
to camera.

21:11.448 --> 21:12.724
Who's gonna go first with that?

21:12.724 --> 21:14.758
-Me. Yes, ma'am.
-Jorgeous. Okay, great.

21:14.758 --> 21:17.275
Now, the challenge of this
is you're doing it to music,

21:17.275 --> 21:19.379
so the timing
is very important.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.413
-Oh, yes, absolutely.
-Okay?

21:20.413 --> 21:22.793
And roll tape, and action.

21:22.793 --> 21:24.827
Poor Tempest DuJour.

21:24.827 --> 21:26.310
They shipped her off
to Shady Pines.

21:26.310 --> 21:28.068
You could find her
in the bingo hall

21:28.068 --> 21:30.172
inserting laxatives
in her behind.

21:30.172 --> 21:33.137
Now she's eating applesauce
with her friend Betty White.

21:33.137 --> 21:35.344
Was that--

21:35.344 --> 21:36.551
We ran out of music.

21:36.551 --> 21:38.862
Oh, I need to be faster, right?

21:38.862 --> 21:42.172
The secret is to fit it in
in the time you have allotted.

21:42.172 --> 21:43.896
You have a lot of words here,
Jorgeous.

21:43.896 --> 21:45.103
Okay, yes.

21:45.103 --> 21:46.344
Girl, why'd you write
a dictionary?

21:46.344 --> 21:47.379
I'm sorry!

21:47.379 --> 21:48.931
Try it again, baby.
Hit it.

21:48.931 --> 21:51.344
She lost all that weight.
In her prime, she was tight.

21:51.344 --> 21:54.758
Now she's eating applesauce
with her friend Betty White.

21:54.758 --> 21:56.862
Gotta be faster.

21:56.862 --> 21:58.206
-So close!
-You ever heard of a speed rap?

21:58.206 --> 21:59.655
Yes.

21:59.655 --> 22:00.827
Yeah, that's kind of
what you're gonna have to do.

22:00.827 --> 22:02.103
Okay.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.344
Hey, DeJa.

22:03.344 --> 22:06.034
Make me feel something.
Round one.

22:06.034 --> 22:08.827
Tempest DuJour,
people say that she's done--

22:08.827 --> 22:10.620
Oh, I just lost the line.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.793
-Hold on, hold on.
-It happens. Cut.

22:11.793 --> 22:13.068
-Okay, okay.
-Here we go.

22:13.068 --> 22:15.827
Tempest DuJour,
people say that she's done--

22:15.827 --> 22:18.206
-Oh, my God.
-It's all right. Cut.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.206
Girl, DeJa is in her head
right now.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.344
Girl, get outta there.

22:21.344 --> 22:22.827
Girl, you need a rope?

22:22.827 --> 22:24.379
You need me
to pull you outta there?

22:24.379 --> 22:25.931
Do this. Brrrrr!

22:25.931 --> 22:29.655
Brrrr--

22:29.655 --> 22:31.620
Brrrr.

22:31.620 --> 22:33.896
That was pblblblblt.

22:33.896 --> 22:35.241
Let's try again.

22:35.241 --> 22:36.862
People say that she's done.

22:36.862 --> 22:40.310
She's so old, her Social
Security number is 1.

22:40.310 --> 22:41.827
Cut. Okay.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.413
There you go, you do it!

22:43.413 --> 22:44.586
Oh, my God.

22:44.586 --> 22:46.655
Here we go, Angie. Go.

22:46.655 --> 22:48.620
Now she--oh.

22:48.620 --> 22:50.586
What are you doing?

22:50.586 --> 22:52.137
What are you doing right now?
Why are you in your head?

22:52.137 --> 22:53.724
Okay, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

22:53.724 --> 22:55.310
I know you got it.

22:55.310 --> 22:56.793
-I got it, I got it.
-Do you know you got it?

22:56.793 --> 22:58.379
I got it, I got it.

22:58.379 --> 23:01.344
I--ugh. Whew.

23:01.344 --> 23:04.448
Girl, this is harder than
what I thought it was gonna be.

23:04.448 --> 23:06.413
Here we go.
Let it all out.

23:06.413 --> 23:09.689
She's old and saggy
like rotten fruit.

23:09.689 --> 23:12.344
I guess it wasn't just
that nude bodysuit.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.241
And cut.

23:17.241 --> 23:19.241
Yes, bitch.

23:19.241 --> 23:20.344
Kerri Colby's next.

23:20.344 --> 23:22.448
I'm here to be ugly, bitch.

23:22.448 --> 23:24.758
I don't know if this is ugly,
but all right.

23:24.758 --> 23:27.517
If this is your idea of ugly,
sweetie, um...

23:27.517 --> 23:28.862
God help us all.

23:28.862 --> 23:30.896
All right, Kerri Colby,
let's give it a shot.

23:30.896 --> 23:33.448
Tempest DuJour
was the cat in a hat

23:33.448 --> 23:37.172
who got told she was old
by a ho-bearded rat.

23:37.172 --> 23:40.206
But then got out-danced
and she fell to the back.

23:40.206 --> 23:42.862
Cut. Good job, Kerri Colby.

23:42.862 --> 23:43.862
-Thank you!
-Keep it up.

23:43.862 --> 23:45.758
Get uglier.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.448
I think that I'm really
slaying this.

23:47.448 --> 23:49.275
I'm hoping for
a top spot placement,

23:49.275 --> 23:51.344
because it's about
fucking time, bitch.

23:51.344 --> 23:54.000
Okay, let's move on
to your B-roll.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.827
Wait. I'm a little scared.

23:55.827 --> 23:57.344
Do I gotta hold this?

23:57.344 --> 23:59.793
I think it's supposed
to be fake-looking.

23:59.793 --> 24:01.965
Bitch, if you hit me
and pop this face...

24:01.965 --> 24:04.275
Girl.

24:04.275 --> 24:06.793
Some of the girls on this team
are doing really well,

24:06.793 --> 24:08.241
but some of the girls
on this team

24:08.241 --> 24:11.034
better hope that
the other teams suck real bad.

24:13.068 --> 24:14.896
Welcome, queens.

24:14.896 --> 24:16.137
-Hey, Michelle.
-Hi!

24:16.137 --> 24:18.310
Hi, Kahmora.
Do you know you're naked?

24:18.310 --> 24:20.896
It's a little nipply in here.

24:20.896 --> 24:23.206
-Ding!
-Let's go.

24:23.206 --> 24:26.241
First up, you are getting ready.

24:26.241 --> 24:28.103
There's definitely a fire
under all three of our tushies.

24:28.103 --> 24:31.137
We are not gonna
fuck this up!

24:31.137 --> 24:32.862
All right, so the moment is

24:32.862 --> 24:37.724
we are getting Kahmora ready
in less than seven hours.

24:37.724 --> 24:39.482
It's gonna be a full show.
Action.

24:39.482 --> 24:42.517
Oh, she's so frantic!

24:42.517 --> 24:44.689
Oh, my God, how is she
gonna make it in time?

24:44.689 --> 24:45.793
-More powder. I'm greasy!
-Okay.

24:45.793 --> 24:47.068
I'm really greasy.

24:47.068 --> 24:49.551
Can you jump a little bit
more for me?

24:49.551 --> 24:51.068
I think they want you already.

24:51.068 --> 24:53.758
Okay, keep on powdering,
keep on powdering!

24:53.758 --> 24:55.620
-Can you scream for me?
-Aah!

24:55.620 --> 24:57.620
-Louder!
-Aah!

24:59.482 --> 25:00.724
And cut.

25:00.724 --> 25:02.586
I think that's a keeper.

25:02.586 --> 25:04.206
Let's move on.

25:04.206 --> 25:05.379
I think it would be best

25:05.379 --> 25:07.862
if we all do
our individual verses.

25:07.862 --> 25:10.482
Okay, Lady Camden.
You're gonna go on that T.

25:10.482 --> 25:13.034
She's a legend, she's a star,

25:13.034 --> 25:15.827
but she's back to tip spots
at her local bar.

25:15.827 --> 25:17.620
Cut. I would like you

25:17.620 --> 25:19.517
to just pick up your volume
a little bit.

25:19.517 --> 25:20.827
I'm gonna do it louder.

25:20.827 --> 25:22.413
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

25:24.344 --> 25:26.172
With Lady Camden,
I can definitely relate,

25:26.172 --> 25:28.965
because I am also
not a naturally loud person.

25:28.965 --> 25:31.034
So Lady Camden,
I am rooting for you, girl.

25:32.517 --> 25:34.310
Bosco, keep
the viewers' attention.

25:34.310 --> 25:35.724
Keep them riveted.

25:35.724 --> 25:38.620
Her time came and went,
and it was all gone in a flash.

25:38.620 --> 25:42.931
So reach into your pockets
and give her some fucking cash.

25:42.931 --> 25:44.689
Come on, Eminem,
spit them lyrics.

25:44.689 --> 25:49.655
Bosco's giving kind of, like,
you know, gangsta rap.

25:49.655 --> 25:53.827
Look at me, trying to be
fucking cool and shit.

25:55.068 --> 25:58.137
The strongest earlobes
in all the Race,

25:58.137 --> 26:01.275
but we saw how fast
she painted her face.

26:01.275 --> 26:05.655
My inspiration is a little bit
of Diane Sawyer,

26:05.655 --> 26:09.241
a little bit of Barbara Walters,
a little bit of Bride of Chucky.

26:09.241 --> 26:11.379
Her tale would soon
get shitty.

26:11.379 --> 26:13.379
If that doesn't want to make you
send me your money,

26:13.379 --> 26:14.758
I don't know what else would.

26:14.758 --> 26:16.344
-Great. Good.
-Thanks.

26:16.344 --> 26:21.931
Okay, queens, I can't wait
to see how your PSA turns out.

26:21.931 --> 26:24.655
-Hi, Michelle!
-Hi, Jaymes Mansfield!

26:24.655 --> 26:26.000
Oh, my gosh, it's you!

26:26.000 --> 26:28.586
So it is time to shoot
our little PSA.

26:28.586 --> 26:32.137
We are all in
our executive business

26:32.137 --> 26:36.068
weatherwoman type of outfits,
except for Orion.

26:36.068 --> 26:37.517
She has, like,
a housewife jumpsuit,

26:37.517 --> 26:39.275
which is questionable.

26:39.275 --> 26:41.000
All right, so who's first up?

26:41.000 --> 26:41.965
I'm first up, yes.

26:41.965 --> 26:43.379
All right, here we go.

26:43.379 --> 26:46.517
A young bedroom queen
too big for her britches.

26:46.517 --> 26:49.103
She really thought she could
compete with these bitches.

26:49.103 --> 26:50.517
She--

26:50.517 --> 26:52.103
Cut. Can we try something?

26:52.103 --> 26:53.931
Can you say,
"She really thought

26:53.931 --> 26:55.620
that she could compete
with these bitches."

26:55.620 --> 26:56.758
Ooh, okay.

26:56.758 --> 26:57.758
Like, you can give
some inflection.

26:57.758 --> 26:59.448
-Okay.
-Okay, here we go.

26:59.448 --> 27:02.379
A young bedroom queen
too big for her britches.

27:02.379 --> 27:04.551
She really thought she could
compete with these bitches.

27:04.551 --> 27:05.862
Cut. That's a keeper.

27:05.862 --> 27:08.413
-Good job. Let's move on.
-Whoo!

27:08.413 --> 27:11.758
So ends the tale
of Jaymes Mans-face,

27:11.758 --> 27:14.586
delusional queen thought
she came in first place.

27:14.586 --> 27:16.206
Willow is serving me

27:16.206 --> 27:19.965
some Lesley Gore does
Jessica Fletcher realness.

27:19.965 --> 27:23.655
So please throw a penny
at this busted-ass pig.

27:23.655 --> 27:27.793
What is this Cabot Cove
creation she has created?

27:27.793 --> 27:28.965
Okay, good.

27:28.965 --> 27:32.103
Orion and her belt.
Hit it.

27:32.103 --> 27:35.655
Her drag is so crusty,
her life is a wreck.

27:35.655 --> 27:38.793
Filming in her bathroom
was cute for a bit.

27:41.137 --> 27:44.034
Orion is just
kind of giving us

27:44.034 --> 27:48.206
more high-off-her-ass housewife.

27:48.206 --> 27:50.689
Is she high off her ass?
That's what I'm wondering.

27:52.206 --> 27:55.517
The queens were challenged
to bring their best Gaga.

27:55.517 --> 27:58.034
She tried her best
to do a tumble pass,

27:58.034 --> 28:01.344
but all she did
was land on that ass.

28:01.344 --> 28:03.137
I love that
you gave it all you got,

28:03.137 --> 28:07.827
but it was so, like,
The Count from Sesame Street.

28:07.827 --> 28:09.448
It was so, like,

28:09.448 --> 28:11.655
I want...to suck...your blood.

28:11.655 --> 28:13.172
Yeah. Okay, here we go.

28:13.172 --> 28:16.206
She tried her best
to do a tumble pass.

28:16.206 --> 28:18.551
She tried...her best...to...

28:19.827 --> 28:23.344
One bad take, ah, ah, ah.

28:23.344 --> 28:27.137
Two bad takes, ah, ah, ah.

28:27.137 --> 28:29.344
I think we just need to take

28:29.344 --> 28:31.965
the cadence out of it.

28:31.965 --> 28:33.310
It's missing
any kind of emotion.

28:33.310 --> 28:37.241
Got it. She tried her best
to do a tumble pass,

28:37.241 --> 28:40.206
but all she did
was land on that flat ass.

28:40.206 --> 28:41.689
Flat?

28:41.689 --> 28:43.724
-Land flat on her ass.
-Land flat on her ass. Sorry.

28:43.724 --> 28:46.517
Let's just say you can
lead a horse to water,

28:46.517 --> 28:49.862
but you can't make a horse
good at acting and comedy.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.275
Let's move on.

28:51.275 --> 28:54.206
Jaymes, come on out.
It's time to work now, baby.

28:54.206 --> 28:55.482
Norma Desmond has risen, yes.

28:55.482 --> 28:58.758
Great. We're a tumble away
from victory.

28:58.758 --> 29:00.068
And action.

29:00.068 --> 29:02.413
She tried with her best
to do a tumble pass,

29:02.413 --> 29:05.241
but all she did was land
flat on that ass.

29:05.241 --> 29:07.620
That was it.
I feel like you're great.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.275
-Whew.
-At the end of this challenge,

29:09.275 --> 29:11.379
I can confidently say...

29:11.379 --> 29:13.310
I did really well.

29:14.379 --> 29:15.517
Coming up...

29:15.517 --> 29:17.965
-I'm feeling pretty cute.
-Yes.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.793
-Maddy, baby, how you feeling?
-Pretty good.

29:19.793 --> 29:20.862
Everybody's saying
that they did well.

29:20.862 --> 29:23.172
Girl, somebody's lying.

29:31.689 --> 29:32.965
Yes!

29:32.965 --> 29:34.517
Aow!

29:34.517 --> 29:35.551
Okay, time to do my makeup.

29:35.551 --> 29:37.068
Whoo!

29:37.068 --> 29:41.000
Today the judges get to watch
our Save a Queen PSA.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.241
I feel like my group
did really well,

29:44.241 --> 29:47.931
but I don't know who did well
in other groups and who didn't.

29:47.931 --> 29:50.103
How are you all feeling
about our team?

29:50.103 --> 29:52.137
I'm feeling pretty cute.

29:52.137 --> 29:54.034
I feel like we had more to prove
than the other teams,

29:54.034 --> 29:56.344
being on the safer side.

29:56.344 --> 29:57.724
Yeah.

29:57.724 --> 30:00.758
But I kind of feel like
it gave us an opportunity

30:00.758 --> 30:02.827
to be a silent
but deadly killer.

30:02.827 --> 30:04.241
Yes!

30:04.241 --> 30:07.241
Being safe twice makes me
feel really insecure.

30:07.241 --> 30:09.793
In this challenge,
I felt like I did a good job.

30:09.793 --> 30:11.517
I can feel my competitive side

30:11.517 --> 30:13.758
just starting to really
bubble up right now.

30:13.758 --> 30:16.896
Were there any moments
where we watch somebody else

30:16.896 --> 30:18.931
and we're, like, ooh?

30:18.931 --> 30:20.172
No.

30:20.172 --> 30:21.655
I wasn't sweating
about either of you.

30:21.655 --> 30:22.827
I'm like, "These girls got it."

30:24.103 --> 30:26.517
Oh, shit, I thought
they were gonna do bad.

30:26.517 --> 30:27.931
Not even gonna lie.

30:27.931 --> 30:29.724
Like, I thought they were
gonna do the worst.

30:29.724 --> 30:31.103
How was your group, Jorgeous?

30:31.103 --> 30:34.586
At first it was kind of
a little struggle for me,

30:34.586 --> 30:36.896
because timing and having
to go quick and all that stuff.

30:36.896 --> 30:38.379
Thank God that I rememberized,

30:38.379 --> 30:40.310
like--remem--rememberized.

30:40.310 --> 30:42.068
-Rememberized your lines?
-Yeah.

30:42.068 --> 30:43.551
Everybody's saying
that they did well,

30:43.551 --> 30:46.379
and I'm like, girl...

30:46.379 --> 30:48.758
Something's wrong.
Somebody's lying.

30:50.827 --> 30:52.862
Maddy, baby, how you feeling?

30:52.862 --> 30:54.206
I feel pretty good.

30:54.206 --> 30:55.310
Michelle didn't have,
like, a lot of notes.

30:55.310 --> 30:56.862
She said I gave,
like, good energy.

30:56.862 --> 30:58.379
Like, I feel okay.

30:58.379 --> 31:00.000
I definitely think I have
to worry a little bit today.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.206
I'm not gonna lie.

31:01.206 --> 31:02.965
Just because
of how I was last week,

31:02.965 --> 31:04.620
and then, like, kind of
being the same now.

31:04.620 --> 31:07.931
You know, Jasmine has been so
confident in this competition,

31:07.931 --> 31:09.310
always being in the top

31:09.310 --> 31:11.931
or feeling like she
should have won sometimes.

31:11.931 --> 31:13.517
This might be
a wake-up call for her.

31:13.517 --> 31:15.172
I'm competitive
as far as, like,

31:15.172 --> 31:17.000
I wanna push myself,
you know what I mean?

31:18.310 --> 31:20.551
I'm feeling really good
about my performance.

31:20.551 --> 31:21.551
I gave it my all.

31:21.551 --> 31:23.103
I'm here to have a good time

31:23.103 --> 31:24.724
and win some challenges.

31:24.724 --> 31:27.068
Maybe this'll be my week.

31:27.068 --> 31:29.275
Orion must be in some delusion,

31:29.275 --> 31:31.965
because he feels super good
about what's going on.

31:31.965 --> 31:33.965
But she was just very flat
in the challenge.

31:37.206 --> 31:42.000
So I know me and you
started drag very, very young.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.068
Oh, yes.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.931
When did you officially start?

31:44.931 --> 31:46.448
I performed at Pride.

31:46.448 --> 31:49.758
I started doing
a lot of draggy things

31:49.758 --> 31:51.275
when I was
five or six years old,

31:51.275 --> 31:54.310
dancing in my parents'
living room.

31:54.310 --> 31:57.206
At 16 I finally got the courage
to put some makeup on

31:57.206 --> 31:59.344
and go out at Gay Pride.

31:59.344 --> 32:01.068
I bought everything myself,

32:01.068 --> 32:04.379
like, my hair, my costume,
my thigh-highs.

32:04.379 --> 32:06.379
I was working at McDonald's
before I started doing drag.

32:06.379 --> 32:08.310
-Yes!
-That's how I paid for my stuff.

32:08.310 --> 32:10.586
When I was at Gay Pride
and I saw the stage,

32:10.586 --> 32:14.758
I was like, "That's what I
need to do. I need to perform."

32:14.758 --> 32:17.310
And I slayed the whole crowd.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.896
It was lit.
I turned the party, girl.

32:19.896 --> 32:23.068
One of the show directors was
like, "Hey, we really like you.

32:23.068 --> 32:24.310
We wanna bring you
to the bar and perform."

32:24.310 --> 32:26.103
And I was like,
"Well, I'm only, like, 16."

32:26.103 --> 32:27.517
And they're like, "Okay.

32:27.517 --> 32:29.413
Well, we'll have to talk
to the manager about that."

32:29.413 --> 32:31.517
They were like,
"Hey, you can perform,

32:31.517 --> 32:32.517
but your parents
had to be there."

32:32.517 --> 32:33.931
So I was like, ugh!

32:33.931 --> 32:36.275
I had to ask my parents
to see if they would let me,

32:36.275 --> 32:38.344
and they were a little iffy
about it at first.

32:38.344 --> 32:40.482
But they were like,
"We're gonna support you,"

32:40.482 --> 32:42.034
so they let me perform.

32:42.034 --> 32:43.827
The first night
that I performed,

32:43.827 --> 32:46.551
like, legit, all my family,
like, came over,

32:46.551 --> 32:48.310
and, like, they packed the bar.

32:48.310 --> 32:50.551
I would have been so nervous.
Oh, my God!

32:50.551 --> 32:54.586
So many girls did not like the
fact that I was working at 16.

32:54.586 --> 32:56.689
You know why? It's because
you're better than them.

32:56.689 --> 32:58.000
Yes. I didn't wanna say it.

32:59.068 --> 33:02.000
Willow, are you,

33:02.000 --> 33:03.310
like, close with your parents?

33:03.310 --> 33:05.758
Yeah, I'm really close
with my mom.

33:05.758 --> 33:07.413
She's, like,
one of my best friends.

33:07.413 --> 33:10.965
I came out when I was 17,
and my mom was so great.

33:10.965 --> 33:13.241
She was just like,
"I love you no matter what."

33:13.241 --> 33:15.241
"We're gonna, you know,
figure this out."

33:15.241 --> 33:17.275
I love that y'all are close.

33:17.275 --> 33:20.206
Because we've just
been through everything.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.172
If you don't
mind me asking,

33:22.172 --> 33:24.344
because I know you have
your medical situations.

33:24.344 --> 33:26.758
When did a lot of that
start happening?

33:26.758 --> 33:28.793
So that was, like, since birth.

33:28.793 --> 33:30.103
I was tested immediately,

33:30.103 --> 33:31.655
because my eldest sister
Elizabeth,

33:31.655 --> 33:34.620
who's eight years older,
has stenosis as well.

33:34.620 --> 33:36.137
Oh, so it's always.

33:36.137 --> 33:37.379
Mm-hmm, it's always
been the case.

33:37.379 --> 33:40.241
I had a transplant
when I was 15 years old.

33:40.241 --> 33:42.724
My brother gave me his kidney.

33:42.724 --> 33:44.413
And now I'm dealing with, like,

33:44.413 --> 33:46.965
all my muscles
are starting to atrophy.

33:46.965 --> 33:52.517
It sucks being 26 years old
and feeling like...

33:57.517 --> 34:01.379
Like, feeling, like, it's, like,
this, like, decline from here.

34:01.379 --> 34:04.344
And it's, like,
you just getting started.

34:04.344 --> 34:08.931
Yeah, it's like I'm supposed
to be in, like, my prime,

34:08.931 --> 34:11.724
and I feel like my body
is, like, disintegrating.

34:11.724 --> 34:16.655
I felt this deep, deep need
to get on Drag Race

34:16.655 --> 34:19.068
to, like, make my statement,
make my stand.

34:21.344 --> 34:23.793
Because I didn't
wanna get lost,

34:23.793 --> 34:26.241
like, get forgotten.

34:26.241 --> 34:30.413
You've managed to, like,
turn into this beautiful thing.

34:30.413 --> 34:33.413
Like, yeah, like,
you're Willow Pill, girl.

34:33.413 --> 34:34.551
Like, you know?

34:34.551 --> 34:37.586
Willow is, like,
just such a fighter.

34:37.586 --> 34:40.344
In this moment,
knowing her story,

34:40.344 --> 34:42.655
I feel more connected to her.

34:42.655 --> 34:44.172
-We good?
-Yeah.

34:44.172 --> 34:45.482
We got each other.
We all right.

34:45.482 --> 34:48.517
Yes, yes.

34:48.517 --> 34:51.103
Ooh, I'm getting emotional
over here in this corner today,

34:51.103 --> 34:53.103
and I gotta finish this mug!

34:53.103 --> 34:55.172
Y'all don't want me
to be nothing.

34:55.172 --> 34:56.758
Y'all don't want me
to be nothing.

34:56.758 --> 34:58.310
We can't take it!

35:21.310 --> 35:22.448
Yeah!

35:22.448 --> 35:24.275
And what?

35:24.275 --> 35:27.448
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

35:27.448 --> 35:32.172
A friend to poor,
unfortunate queens everywhere,

35:32.172 --> 35:33.896
Michelle Visage.

35:33.896 --> 35:36.413
It won't cost much.
Just your voice.

35:39.103 --> 35:41.241
The hilarious Ross Mathews.

35:41.241 --> 35:44.724
Now, Ross, I hear you
started your own nonprofit?

35:44.724 --> 35:46.241
Yeah, thank you
for bringing that up.

35:46.241 --> 35:47.517
We collect one dollar bills

35:47.517 --> 35:49.448
to stuff in go-go boys'
G-strings.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.931
It's a cause
I can really get behind.

35:51.931 --> 35:55.517
Hey, listen, you can count on me
for a hundred bucks.

35:55.517 --> 35:57.620
Oh, thank you so much.

35:57.620 --> 36:00.172
And she's no stranger
to kings and queens.

36:00.172 --> 36:03.275
The fabulous Ava Max.
Welcome!

36:03.275 --> 36:06.448
Thank you, Mama Ru.
I am so excited to be here.

36:06.448 --> 36:07.586
We're so happy you're here.

36:07.586 --> 36:09.758
This week
we challenged our queens

36:09.758 --> 36:14.000
to raise awareness in their own
public service announcements.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.551
And tonight on the runway,
category is Spring Has Sprung.

36:18.551 --> 36:21.551
Racers, start your engines,

36:21.551 --> 36:23.931
and may the best drag queen win.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.758
Coming up...

36:25.758 --> 36:28.206
This look is to die for.
I want it myself.

36:28.206 --> 36:32.000
Leave that dress
in my dressing room.

36:42.758 --> 36:46.586
Category is
Spring Has Sprung.

36:46.586 --> 36:49.310
First up is Jorgeous.

36:49.310 --> 36:51.586
She's got
a little Spring in her step.

36:53.103 --> 36:54.310
Jorgeous:
I'm serving you my little

36:54.310 --> 36:57.103
cutesy-bootsie
mint-green fantasy.

36:57.103 --> 36:59.137
Girl, I'm ready
for this tea party.

36:59.137 --> 37:01.931
I am the definition
of Spring Has Sprung.

37:01.931 --> 37:03.206
You know what
her favorite TV show is?

37:03.206 --> 37:04.862
-What?
-Blossom.

37:04.862 --> 37:06.586
Whoa.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.172
Kerri Colby.

37:09.172 --> 37:10.551
Bouquet?

37:10.551 --> 37:13.689
I'm bringing you
creature couture.

37:13.689 --> 37:16.931
I feel like an alien,
very avant-garde.

37:16.931 --> 37:18.862
I really do feel like

37:18.862 --> 37:21.172
I was able to step out
of my comfort zone,

37:21.172 --> 37:23.862
both in my challenge
and in this runway.

37:23.862 --> 37:25.310
And you know what?
It's kind of fun.

37:25.310 --> 37:28.241
Stems, stems,
stems across the board.

37:29.896 --> 37:32.931
Angeria
Paris VanMicheals.

37:32.931 --> 37:35.310
Michelle:
It's gonna be a lovely day.

37:36.862 --> 37:38.862
My look
is inspired by Cardi B.

37:38.862 --> 37:42.000
Baby, I am giving you
every kind of flower, bitch.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.034
I'm giving you orange flowers,
pink flowers,

37:44.034 --> 37:46.034
yellow flowers, white flowers.

37:46.034 --> 37:49.655
I want the judges to smell
the flowers, honey, yes!

37:49.655 --> 37:51.413
You heard
of Flowers for Algernon?

37:51.413 --> 37:53.724
-Uh-huh.
-This is Flowers for Angeria.

37:55.586 --> 37:57.517
DeJa Skye.

37:57.517 --> 37:59.586
Oh, it's the Beaster Bunny.

37:59.586 --> 38:01.206
Oh, my God.

38:01.206 --> 38:04.689
Bitch, I look like
Spring threw up all over me,

38:04.689 --> 38:06.448
and I feel amazing.

38:06.448 --> 38:08.310
I am known as
the pastel princess,

38:08.310 --> 38:12.068
so this was my runway
to stomp it out.

38:12.068 --> 38:14.000
Well, she's really
into hip-hop.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.206
Maddy Morphosis.

38:17.206 --> 38:19.689
Ladies and gentlemen,
Stormy Daniels.

38:21.620 --> 38:23.379
I feel like when a lot
of people think of Spring,

38:23.379 --> 38:24.931
they obviously think
very, like, pastels,

38:24.931 --> 38:26.896
Easter, very fun, playful.

38:26.896 --> 38:29.275
But I'm Mother Nature,
and I am here

38:29.275 --> 38:31.413
to wash away the rest
of the competition.

38:31.413 --> 38:34.482
Welcome to the stage,
our raining queen.

38:36.034 --> 38:39.517
Jasmine Kennedie.
Always after me Lucky Charms.

38:39.517 --> 38:41.448
I would wear this.
I love this.

38:41.448 --> 38:43.000
I decided to bring

38:43.000 --> 38:46.620
this beautiful
beaded and stoned corset

38:46.620 --> 38:50.068
that I made all by myself.

38:50.068 --> 38:53.827
And nobody can tell me I don't
look goddamn good in this,

38:53.827 --> 38:56.413
point blank, period.

38:56.413 --> 38:57.413
Michelle:
How green is her valley?

38:59.206 --> 39:00.827
RuPaul; Orion Story.

39:00.827 --> 39:04.448
Bitch betta have
my bunny.

39:04.448 --> 39:07.448
When I think of Spring,
I immediately think of bunnies,

39:07.448 --> 39:11.000
so I am giving you my spin
on an Easter bunny.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.379
She's very flirty
and absolutely sexy.

39:15.379 --> 39:17.103
She may win
by just a hare.

39:18.620 --> 39:21.000
RuPaul:
Up next, Willow Pill.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Putting the "home"
in "homosexual."

39:24.000 --> 39:27.344
This is my Little House
On The Fairy look,

39:27.344 --> 39:29.172
with these cute little
pastel houses

39:29.172 --> 39:31.344
with fresh grass on their lawn.

39:31.344 --> 39:33.275
There's flowers
in the windowsills.

39:33.275 --> 39:36.517
And then when I turn around,
it says "help" in blood.

39:36.517 --> 39:39.551
I feel super me.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.586
Oh, yes,
Willow Pill the house down!

39:42.793 --> 39:44.137
Daya Betty.

39:44.137 --> 39:46.862
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joey Heatherton.

39:46.862 --> 39:49.137
I am fluttering around

39:49.137 --> 39:51.724
feeling like
the cutest little pixie.

39:51.724 --> 39:54.310
I have butterflies swarming me,

39:54.310 --> 39:56.655
and then a wasp
starts circling around me,

39:56.655 --> 39:58.172
and I have to make sure
to shoo it away,

39:58.172 --> 40:00.862
because it's Butterfly Betty
only today, honey.

40:00.862 --> 40:02.586
Michelle:
Take that, Asia O'Hara.

40:04.827 --> 40:06.620
Lady Camden.

40:06.620 --> 40:09.068
I knew
she was into teabagging.

40:10.517 --> 40:12.310
I'm giving you
a Spring look

40:12.310 --> 40:15.793
that honestly was inspired
by my grandmother's tablecloth.

40:15.793 --> 40:17.310
Do you have a sweet tooth?

40:17.310 --> 40:19.000
Mmm, take a little nibble.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.931
Literal tea time, bitch.

40:20.931 --> 40:23.172
-Oh!
-She's spillin' the tea!

40:23.172 --> 40:25.758
Michelle:
We do see her PG Tips.

40:25.758 --> 40:29.172
Up next, Bosco.

40:29.172 --> 40:30.724
There's a storm a'brewin'.

40:30.724 --> 40:32.482
I am pumping
down the runway

40:32.482 --> 40:34.758
in my lovely
little thundercloud.

40:34.758 --> 40:37.827
My legs are glistening
like gas station hotdogs.

40:37.827 --> 40:41.379
We get to the end,
and I tear down the storm cloud

40:41.379 --> 40:43.862
to reveal a full, sunny day
ball gown.

40:43.862 --> 40:46.310
Michelle:
Enter Little Miss Sunshine.

40:46.310 --> 40:47.620
I can make it through the rain.

40:47.620 --> 40:50.413
And let's give it up
one more time

40:50.413 --> 40:52.896
for our returning queens,
Tempest DuJour.

40:52.896 --> 40:56.724
I'm ready for
my close up, Miss Charles.

40:56.724 --> 40:58.206
Leopard and gold,

40:58.206 --> 41:02.103
and she's keeping
that tuna casserole hot!

41:02.103 --> 41:05.517
This isn't the last you've seen
of Tempest DuJour.

41:07.862 --> 41:09.137
Michelle:
Who needs Sunset Boulevard

41:09.137 --> 41:11.586
when you can have
Hollywood Boulevard?

41:11.586 --> 41:14.206
Jaymes Mansfield.

41:14.206 --> 41:16.206
Oh, bee-hive.

41:16.206 --> 41:18.896
Hey, shape-shifters,

41:18.896 --> 41:20.793
I am serving Shirley MacLaine

41:20.793 --> 41:23.965
inWhat a Way to Go,
only in pink.

41:23.965 --> 41:26.896
I am feeling so great
being back on this runway.

41:26.896 --> 41:28.689
Take a bow.

41:28.689 --> 41:30.517
I mean, a bow.
I mean, a bowel.

41:32.103 --> 41:35.379
Kahmora Hall. Ooh!

41:35.379 --> 41:37.896
Michelle:
Mackie doll, desert edition.

41:37.896 --> 41:40.000
I am wearing
a vintage Mackie

41:40.000 --> 41:42.448
Spring/Summer 2001 dress

41:42.448 --> 41:44.000
from his final runway
collection.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.310
I am the true fashion queen
of my season,

41:46.310 --> 41:48.275
and I told y'all,
I am not going back in my box.

41:48.275 --> 41:50.517
You know what?
I'm rooting for her.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.448
Coming up...

41:55.448 --> 41:58.034
Your take on Spring Has Sprung
is really, really cute.

41:58.034 --> 41:59.724
This is something
I would wear to perform.

41:59.724 --> 42:01.620
This seemed a little stiff.

42:09.137 --> 42:10.862
Welcome, ladies.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.172
It's time for the world debut

42:13.172 --> 42:15.137
of your public service
announcement.

42:35.379 --> 42:37.034
Poor Tempest DuJour.

42:37.034 --> 42:38.551
They sent her off
to Shady Pines.

42:38.551 --> 42:40.000
You could find her
in the bingo hall

42:40.000 --> 42:42.448
inserting laxatives
in her behind.

42:42.448 --> 42:45.000
She lost all that weight.
In her prime, she was tight.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.827
Now she's eating applesauce
with her friend Betty White.

42:47.827 --> 42:50.551
Tempest DuJour
was the cat in a hat

42:50.551 --> 42:54.206
who got told she was old
by a ho-bearded rat.

42:54.206 --> 42:57.000
She had things to say
because the bitch was so wack,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.206
but then got out-danced
and she fell to the back.

43:00.206 --> 43:03.206
Now her nurse is her only fan.

43:03.206 --> 43:06.034
Even her kids don't wanna
follow an ancient man.

43:06.034 --> 43:09.413
She's old and saggy
like rotten fruit.

43:09.413 --> 43:12.586
I guess it wasn't just
that nude bodysuit.

43:12.586 --> 43:15.620
Tempest DuJour,
people say that she's done.

43:15.620 --> 43:18.758
She's so old, her
Social Security number is 1.

43:18.758 --> 43:21.655
If she were to fall,
911 gets the call.

43:21.655 --> 43:24.517
Death drop, they said,
now poor Tempest is dead!

43:25.620 --> 43:28.241
For such 69 cents a day,

43:28.241 --> 43:30.413
you can supply Miss DuJour

43:30.413 --> 43:33.793
with a box of adult diapers.

43:33.793 --> 43:36.586
For a small monthly donation,

43:36.586 --> 43:40.862
we can pay Tempest's children
to build her a new walker.

43:40.862 --> 43:43.448
What's that bitch name again?

43:43.448 --> 43:45.551
-Oh. Who?

43:53.172 --> 43:55.655
A young bedroom queen,
too big for her britches.

43:55.655 --> 43:58.551
She really thought she could
compete with these bitches.

43:58.551 --> 44:01.241
She came in with whimsy
and puppets in tow,

44:01.241 --> 44:03.620
but her little friend
couldn't help her.

44:03.620 --> 44:05.620
The bitch had to go.

44:05.620 --> 44:08.724
The queens were challenged
to bring their best Gaga,

44:08.724 --> 44:12.068
but Jaymes showed up
in literal caca.

44:12.068 --> 44:15.068
She tried her best
to do a tumble pass,

44:15.068 --> 44:18.103
but all she did was land
flat on that ass.

44:18.103 --> 44:21.758
Her drag is so crusty,
her life is a wreck.

44:21.758 --> 44:25.000
Now all this girl needs
is just a paycheck.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.379
Filming in her bathroom
was cute for a bit.

44:27.379 --> 44:30.413
But likes and subscribes,
that don't pay for shit.

44:30.413 --> 44:33.551
So ends the tale
of Jaymes Mans-face.

44:33.551 --> 44:36.413
Delusional queen thought
she came in first place.

44:36.413 --> 44:39.137
Still scouring the streets
for secondhand wigs,

44:39.137 --> 44:42.206
so please throw a penny
at this busted-ass pig.

44:44.103 --> 44:47.724
She doesn't need much,
just a buffalo nickel...

44:47.724 --> 44:49.275
and maybe some new tights.

44:49.275 --> 44:52.172
She's just a child,

44:52.172 --> 44:54.724
a 312-month-old baby!

44:55.827 --> 44:57.896
With every donation,

44:57.896 --> 45:01.344
you'll receive a free pair
of noise-canceling headphones

45:01.344 --> 45:04.137
so you can block out
that godawful voice.

45:11.172 --> 45:14.000
Kahmora hails
from the Windy City.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.344
Little did she know her tale
would soon get shitty.

45:17.344 --> 45:20.413
The strongest earlobes
in all the race,

45:20.413 --> 45:23.724
but we saw how fast
that she painted her face.

45:23.724 --> 45:26.965
She's a legend, she's a star,

45:26.965 --> 45:29.137
but she's back to tip spots
at her local bar.

45:29.137 --> 45:31.931
Every queen has their day,

45:31.931 --> 45:36.068
but there was just one line
she couldn't quite say.

45:36.068 --> 45:38.758
She said,
"I was rooting for us."

45:38.758 --> 45:41.724
I mean, damn.
She even padded her bust.

45:41.724 --> 45:44.758
Her time came and went,
and it was all gone in a flash.

45:44.758 --> 45:48.379
So reach into your pockets
and give her some fucking cash.

45:49.551 --> 45:52.482
Did you know
that some drag queens

45:52.482 --> 45:58.413
have to get ready
in less than seven hours?

45:58.413 --> 45:59.896
Every five minutes,

45:59.896 --> 46:03.620
a drag queen develops
elephantitis in her earlobes.

46:03.620 --> 46:06.137
Somewhere right now,

46:06.137 --> 46:08.344
there's
a poor little drag queen

46:08.344 --> 46:09.896
crying in Untucked

46:09.896 --> 46:12.068
because, well,
she's safe again this week.

46:15.413 --> 46:17.413
Is this song still going on?

46:31.379 --> 46:33.655
Call now and donate
just an hour of your time

46:33.655 --> 46:36.448
so we could give her
the attention she needs.

46:36.448 --> 46:38.482
When we reach our donation goal,

46:38.482 --> 46:40.758
we'll do these tired queens
the ultimate service

46:40.758 --> 46:44.482
of putting them to sleep...
for good.

46:44.482 --> 46:47.068
You can sponsor a drag queen
like Kahmora...

46:47.068 --> 46:50.655
By donating
a sensible 74 cents.

46:50.655 --> 46:52.827
That way, she can buy
a fucking watch.

46:58.827 --> 47:01.103
Hi, I'm Sarah McLachlan,

47:01.103 --> 47:04.655
and this is wrong
on so many levels.

47:11.413 --> 47:12.551
I was touched,

47:12.551 --> 47:14.793
but I won't tell you where.

47:16.551 --> 47:18.000
Coming up...

47:18.000 --> 47:19.275
It was so perfectly timed.

47:19.275 --> 47:21.931
You came to slay,
and you did just that.

47:21.931 --> 47:24.586
Because of the way you talked,
there's no energy.

47:32.482 --> 47:34.758
Ladies,
I've made some decisions.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.724
When I call your name,
please step forward.

47:39.206 --> 47:40.172
Kerri Colby.

47:41.448 --> 47:43.206
DeJa Skye.

47:43.206 --> 47:45.655
Maddy Morphosis.

47:45.655 --> 47:47.724
Willow Pill.

47:47.724 --> 47:49.448
Daya Betty.

47:49.448 --> 47:53.000
Ladies, you are all safe.

47:54.965 --> 47:58.068
And Tempest, Jaymes,
and Kahmora,

47:58.068 --> 48:02.241
thank you for your dedicated
service to the call of drag.

48:02.241 --> 48:04.344
You may leave the stage.

48:04.344 --> 48:09.517
And Kahmora, leave that dress
in my dressing room.

48:13.517 --> 48:16.620
It's time for
the judges' critiques,

48:16.620 --> 48:19.517
starting with Jorgeous.

48:19.517 --> 48:21.068
This look is to die for.

48:21.068 --> 48:24.034
Your makeup and this updo
is so gorgeous,

48:24.034 --> 48:25.793
I want it myself.

48:25.793 --> 48:27.586
That confidence
you have on the runway

48:27.586 --> 48:29.931
was not on the screen.

48:29.931 --> 48:32.103
You struggled quite a bit.

48:32.103 --> 48:34.068
You put too many words in it.

48:34.068 --> 48:36.000
It was kind of just
get the words in there,

48:36.000 --> 48:37.206
and really no emotion.

48:37.206 --> 48:39.517
How many words
did you put up in there?

48:39.517 --> 48:41.241
I really tried my best
to, like, work with what I got,

48:41.241 --> 48:42.482
and even my team members--

48:42.482 --> 48:43.448
What do you mean,
"with what you got?"

48:43.448 --> 48:44.758
You wrote it, didn't you?

48:44.758 --> 48:47.172
-Yes, yes.

48:47.172 --> 48:48.827
Now, listen,
why didn't you have

48:48.827 --> 48:51.000
any false eyelashes on
in your thing?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.241
Oh, because I wanted to give

48:52.241 --> 48:54.931
very, like,
bland, regular-degular,

48:54.931 --> 48:56.448
like, white woman thing.

48:56.448 --> 48:59.137
-On a drag show?
-Yes.

48:59.137 --> 49:00.206
Thank you, Jorgeous.

49:00.206 --> 49:01.655
Thank you, RuPaul.

49:01.655 --> 49:04.551
Up next, Miss Angeria.

49:04.551 --> 49:06.344
I love the bottom part
of this dress.

49:06.344 --> 49:08.689
I think there's
a fit issue up here.

49:08.689 --> 49:10.172
That surprises me,

49:10.172 --> 49:13.620
because I expect
a really high level from you.

49:13.620 --> 49:14.965
Let's talk about
your performance.

49:14.965 --> 49:16.482
I thought you were really funny.

49:16.482 --> 49:19.137
-You hit that last joke.
-What's that bitch name again?

49:19.137 --> 49:20.827
It was so perfectly timed.

49:20.827 --> 49:22.103
Ooh!

49:22.103 --> 49:23.896
It needed that punch,
and you delivered.

49:23.896 --> 49:25.310
You know who you are,

49:25.310 --> 49:27.827
and you apply it
to every single challenge.

49:27.827 --> 49:30.586
-Are you a poet?
-I am not a poet.

49:30.586 --> 49:32.172
The answer is
"Yes, Miss Paul.

49:32.172 --> 49:33.793
You got a poet job for me?"

49:33.793 --> 49:36.379
Yes, Miss Paul.
You got a poet job for me?

49:39.103 --> 49:41.379
Up next, Jasmine Kennedie.

49:41.379 --> 49:43.793
You were so excited,
you were so ready.

49:43.793 --> 49:45.103
The issue for you,

49:45.103 --> 49:46.413
it was very "'Twas the night
before Christmas

49:46.413 --> 49:47.965
and all through the house."

49:47.965 --> 49:49.137
You couldn't break out of it.

49:49.137 --> 49:51.793
This seemed a little stiff.

49:51.793 --> 49:53.517
And I usually
don't mind a stiffy.

49:53.517 --> 49:55.758
Me either.

49:55.758 --> 49:57.206
But this look is just so draggy.

49:57.206 --> 50:00.137
That is the biggest compliment
I could give you.

50:00.137 --> 50:02.379
-Thank you.
-This is my favorite.

50:02.379 --> 50:05.000
This is something I would wear
to perform myself.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.862
I would keep an eye out
for Alyssa Edwards

50:07.862 --> 50:09.413
in some dark alleyway.

50:09.413 --> 50:11.000
She's gonna be coming for you,

50:11.000 --> 50:15.689
because you look like
a younger version of her.

50:15.689 --> 50:17.000
Did I just say that?

50:17.000 --> 50:18.241
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

50:18.241 --> 50:21.620
She's coming for you now.

50:21.620 --> 50:25.000
Up next, Orion Story.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.103
You look beautiful.

50:26.103 --> 50:27.379
I think your body
looks fantastic.

50:27.379 --> 50:29.379
It's not my favorite
Spring look,

50:29.379 --> 50:31.724
but I understand
what you were going for.

50:31.724 --> 50:35.034
I struggled with you in the PSA.

50:35.034 --> 50:36.275
And maybe some new tights.

50:36.275 --> 50:38.413
It could have been
more emotion,

50:38.413 --> 50:41.655
more bubbly or warm.

50:41.655 --> 50:44.344
Because of the way you talk and
the cadence that you speak in,

50:44.344 --> 50:45.344
there's no energy.

50:45.344 --> 50:47.689
When people get into drag,

50:47.689 --> 50:50.758
usually it pulls out
this sort of other self.

50:50.758 --> 50:53.068
Coming in with all
these new people and stuff,

50:53.068 --> 50:55.310
like, I'm a little awkward
sometimes.

50:55.310 --> 50:57.655
So I just need to get
through that, you know?

50:57.655 --> 50:59.482
All right, thank you, Orion.

50:59.482 --> 51:01.034
Thank you.

51:01.034 --> 51:03.379
Up next, Lady Camden.

51:03.379 --> 51:04.586
Okay, so here's the tea.

51:07.068 --> 51:08.862
I love this look.

51:08.862 --> 51:10.862
I love it
because it's so campy.

51:10.862 --> 51:13.206
I get who you are
just with this look.

51:13.206 --> 51:16.103
I thought you were great
in the PSA,

51:16.103 --> 51:20.344
because you delivered it like
a proper television presenter,

51:20.344 --> 51:22.344
and the words you were saying
were so stupid.

51:22.344 --> 51:25.517
And that presentability
and ridiculousness

51:25.517 --> 51:28.379
are my favorite things together.

51:28.379 --> 51:29.655
You killed this.

51:29.655 --> 51:32.034
You came to slay,
and you did just that.

51:32.034 --> 51:36.068
I think the only note I gave you
was, "I can't hear you."

51:36.068 --> 51:37.310
I think the girls can agree

51:37.310 --> 51:40.724
I'm not the loudest voice
in the room,

51:40.724 --> 51:43.000
and I'm going to work on
being a little louder.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.344
Thank you, Lady Camden.

51:44.344 --> 51:45.586
Thank you.

51:45.586 --> 51:47.931
Up next, Bosco.

51:47.931 --> 51:49.413
Shalom.

51:49.413 --> 51:51.965
You were the only one
who really did, like, poetry,

51:51.965 --> 51:53.655
like, spoken word.

51:53.655 --> 51:55.206
I really appreciated it,

51:55.206 --> 51:57.310
because it was different
to everybody else,

51:57.310 --> 52:00.206
and that's how you stand out
in this competition.

52:00.206 --> 52:03.551
There's a thing about you
as a performer I find dangerous.

52:03.551 --> 52:06.724
I feel like you're willing
to really take a risk.

52:06.724 --> 52:08.448
That is so exciting to watch.

52:08.448 --> 52:10.206
And tonight on the runway,

52:10.206 --> 52:11.620
you came out
as a little storm cloud,

52:11.620 --> 52:14.275
and you revealed
to a ray of sun.

52:14.275 --> 52:15.862
I've been doing, like,

52:15.862 --> 52:20.034
a seasonal affective disorder
number in Seattle for years,

52:20.034 --> 52:23.172
and so I thought
I'd bring it to L.A. as well.

52:23.172 --> 52:25.655
Oh! Oh, God, only Seattle.

52:27.448 --> 52:30.344
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

52:30.344 --> 52:32.310
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

52:32.310 --> 52:34.379
the judges and I
will deliberate.

52:35.896 --> 52:38.620
All right now, just between
us squirrel friends,

52:38.620 --> 52:41.448
what do you think?
Jorgeous.

52:41.448 --> 52:43.344
Jorgeous pops so much
out on this runway,

52:43.344 --> 52:45.517
but there just
was none of that in the PSA.

52:45.517 --> 52:48.413
It just felt like she couldn't
get out of her own way.

52:48.413 --> 52:49.517
She knows how to do it
on the runway.

52:49.517 --> 52:52.275
Just apply that
to the challenges

52:52.275 --> 52:54.068
and you're golden.

52:54.068 --> 52:55.827
Angeria.

52:55.827 --> 52:57.310
That Sparta/Gorgia accent...

52:58.586 --> 53:01.000
Is like--it's honey.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.344
It's so amazing.

53:02.344 --> 53:04.241
She is a naturally funny person.

53:04.241 --> 53:06.103
She has great timing.

53:06.103 --> 53:09.068
Tonight on the runway, if it
don't fit, you must acquit,

53:09.068 --> 53:13.965
and I'm sorry,
but it did not fit.

53:13.965 --> 53:15.379
Jasmine Kennedie.

53:15.379 --> 53:16.724
You know those YouTube videos

53:16.724 --> 53:18.586
where they, like,
put frosting on a balloon

53:18.586 --> 53:20.344
and when someone cuts it and it
pops, there's no cake there?

53:20.344 --> 53:21.655
Yes.

53:21.655 --> 53:23.620
That's how I feel
about her in this PSA.

53:23.620 --> 53:26.000
I missed the goods.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.827
But I do think
she's just fresh and new,

53:28.827 --> 53:30.241
and I like her energy.

53:30.241 --> 53:31.275
I think she's a grower.

53:31.275 --> 53:33.551
Oh, a grower!

53:33.551 --> 53:35.448
Tell me more.

53:35.448 --> 53:37.275
Orion Story.

53:37.275 --> 53:41.448
In the challenge, you could see
her completely going inward.

53:41.448 --> 53:44.965
And no matter what, it came out
the same way every time.

53:44.965 --> 53:47.413
She doesn't deliver
any persona.

53:47.413 --> 53:49.103
There's so much
potential there.

53:49.103 --> 53:50.413
She just fell so flat.

53:50.413 --> 53:51.896
I would have settled
for a little eggshell.

53:51.896 --> 53:55.034
I'm not asking for gloss,
just a little something.

53:55.034 --> 53:57.724
I love your paint references,
Ross.

53:57.724 --> 53:59.758
I don't know
if you're mocking me.

53:59.758 --> 54:02.137
Well, from now on, I will
be calling you Glossy Rossy.

54:02.137 --> 54:03.827
-Yes!
-Oh!

54:03.827 --> 54:06.103
Lady Camden from the UK.

54:06.103 --> 54:08.689
Right out of the gate
she was emoting,

54:08.689 --> 54:10.724
and that's what we needed
in these PSAs.

54:10.724 --> 54:12.137
The cheesier, the better,

54:12.137 --> 54:14.896
and she was giving
full frontal fromage.

54:14.896 --> 54:17.896
It was rotten,
and it was funny and perfect.

54:17.896 --> 54:19.931
She was a great actress.

54:19.931 --> 54:21.413
So much so
that I bet James Lipton

54:21.413 --> 54:22.896
would wanna interview her.

54:22.896 --> 54:24.275
Well, you know, he's dead.

54:24.275 --> 54:25.689
I know he's dead, but
it's a good tea reference.

54:25.689 --> 54:26.724
You get it?

54:26.724 --> 54:28.724
Oh, now that was a stretch.

54:28.724 --> 54:30.000
-Now, come on!
-That was a stretch.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.275
-High gloss?
-Ha!

54:31.275 --> 54:33.275
She put a lot of effort
into it, and she shines.

54:33.275 --> 54:37.344
The truth is, she could really
be a player this season.

54:37.344 --> 54:38.482
Bosco.

54:38.482 --> 54:40.724
The confidence,
next, next, next level,

54:40.724 --> 54:42.448
unlike anyone else I saw.

54:42.448 --> 54:46.517
She goes from that PSA,
where she's dangerous and edgy,

54:46.517 --> 54:51.448
to this runway, where
she's this burlesque daydream.

54:51.448 --> 54:54.896
It is thrilling to watch what
she's doing in this competition.

54:54.896 --> 54:56.586
Silence!

54:56.586 --> 54:59.103
I think I've heard enough.

54:59.103 --> 55:01.241
In fact, you know,
I've made my decision.

55:01.241 --> 55:06.068
Shake the man's hand, daddy,
and bring back my girls.

55:06.068 --> 55:07.241
You heard the woman!

55:14.137 --> 55:16.379
Welcome back, ladies.

55:16.379 --> 55:17.862
I've made some decisions.

55:21.379 --> 55:22.517
Orion Story.

55:22.517 --> 55:25.413
We are still waiting

55:25.413 --> 55:27.379
for you to spring into action.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.137
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

55:33.379 --> 55:35.655
Lady Camden.

55:35.655 --> 55:38.172
This week,
you served the tea,

55:38.172 --> 55:39.931
and it was piping hot.

55:42.620 --> 55:44.068
You are safe.

55:44.068 --> 55:46.310
Thank you.

55:49.000 --> 55:54.344
Bosco. This week,
the fog lifted and you shined.

55:56.310 --> 55:58.482
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

56:01.586 --> 56:02.965
Thank you.

56:02.965 --> 56:05.724
You've won a cash prize
of $5,000.

56:05.724 --> 56:07.310
Yes!

56:07.310 --> 56:09.000
I'm a wiener!

56:09.000 --> 56:11.137
I've put a point
up on the board.

56:11.137 --> 56:14.586
I'm in it,
and that feels so good.

56:16.551 --> 56:21.896
Angeria Paris VanMicheals.

56:21.896 --> 56:23.000
You're safe.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
Thank you.

56:26.655 --> 56:30.344
Jorgeous, Jasmine Kennedie,

56:30.344 --> 56:32.206
to save a queen,

56:32.206 --> 56:34.448
first you have to save yourself.

56:40.172 --> 56:42.482
Jorgeous.

56:44.413 --> 56:46.517
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

56:49.793 --> 56:53.517
Jasmine Kennedie, you are safe.

56:53.517 --> 56:56.551
Thank you. Thank you.

56:56.551 --> 57:00.103
Two queens stand before me.

57:00.103 --> 57:02.896
Prior to tonight,

57:02.896 --> 57:06.068
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

57:06.068 --> 57:09.310
of My Head and My Heart
by Ava Max.

57:10.655 --> 57:15.137
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:15.137 --> 57:20.275
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:22.689 --> 57:24.724
The time has come...

57:24.724 --> 57:26.931
for you to lip sync...

57:26.931 --> 57:30.793
for your life!

57:34.172 --> 57:35.620
I am excited.

57:35.620 --> 57:38.689
This is gonna be one of those
lip syncs to watch,

57:38.689 --> 57:42.482
because Miss Jorgeous
is gonna buck her ass down.

57:44.965 --> 57:50.068
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

57:50.068 --> 57:51.241
Throw it down!

57:51.241 --> 57:53.965
Yes, bitch, go off!

58:39.827 --> 58:41.275
My eyes are focused on Jorgeous,

58:41.275 --> 58:44.034
and I'm just, like,
yes, give it to me.

58:45.586 --> 58:48.620
She is just such
a good goddamn performer.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.965
I was shook.
The whole stage was shook.

59:22.034 --> 59:24.896
Orion has kicked off her shoes.

59:24.896 --> 59:26.965
I thought we went over that
with June.

59:26.965 --> 59:28.275
We don't take off shoes.

59:52.275 --> 59:53.758
Wow.

59:53.758 --> 59:56.517
Ladies, I've made my decision.

1:00:01.931 --> 1:00:04.137
Jorgeous, shantay you stay.

1:00:07.310 --> 1:00:08.793
Thank y'all so much.

1:00:08.793 --> 1:00:10.620
You may join the other girls.

1:00:18.620 --> 1:00:20.482
Orion Story.

1:00:20.482 --> 1:00:23.172
Your fate now rests

1:00:23.172 --> 1:00:25.896
in the hands of the drag gods.

1:00:25.896 --> 1:00:30.689
If you have the gold bar,
you will be saved.

1:00:32.689 --> 1:00:33.965
You've been hiding your candy.

1:00:36.310 --> 1:00:37.379
Let's see what you got.

1:00:38.551 --> 1:00:43.034
When I tell you
that I am praying--

1:00:43.034 --> 1:00:44.275
and I'm not religious--

1:00:44.275 --> 1:00:46.586
I'm praying
that I have the gold bar,

1:00:46.586 --> 1:00:49.620
because I am not ready
to leave yet.

1:00:52.551 --> 1:00:57.137
It's chocolate.

1:00:57.137 --> 1:01:00.896
Orion, today
is where your story begins.

1:01:00.896 --> 1:01:03.724
The rest is still unwritten.

1:01:03.724 --> 1:01:07.344
Now sashay away.

1:01:07.344 --> 1:01:09.758
Thank you so much.

1:01:09.758 --> 1:01:11.344
We love you, baby!

1:01:11.344 --> 1:01:12.689
I love you all so much.

1:01:12.689 --> 1:01:14.448
We love you, Orion.

1:01:14.448 --> 1:01:15.724
Y'all got it the first time.

1:01:19.517 --> 1:01:22.000
I'm so proud that, like,
I made it here

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.275
and I got to show the world
who I am.

1:01:25.275 --> 1:01:27.172
I definitely know
I made my mom proud.

1:01:27.172 --> 1:01:29.586
I'm so excited
for what's to come.

1:01:29.586 --> 1:01:30.724
Y'all ain't seen the last of me.

1:01:33.413 --> 1:01:35.724
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1:01:35.724 --> 1:01:39.103
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:01:39.103 --> 1:01:40.758
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?

1:01:40.758 --> 1:01:42.379
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:01:42.379 --> 1:01:43.482
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:01:43.482 --> 1:01:45.793
All right.
Now let the music play!

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:00.379
Next time
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

1:02:00.379 --> 1:02:01.896
-Oh!
-Oh!

1:02:01.896 --> 1:02:04.827
Michelle Visage. She's been
compulsively shopping

1:02:04.827 --> 1:02:06.620
online late nights.

1:02:06.620 --> 1:02:09.206
You need to create
unforgettable looks

1:02:09.206 --> 1:02:13.344
using only the materials
found in these packages.

1:02:13.344 --> 1:02:15.379
The idea is to be, like,
a child's nightmare.

1:02:16.517 --> 1:02:17.620
Okay.

1:02:17.620 --> 1:02:19.689
Oh.

1:02:19.689 --> 1:02:22.758
You are a vision tonight.

1:02:22.758 --> 1:02:25.689
It is classic bougie snatch it.

1:02:25.689 --> 1:02:27.482
Well, I disagree.
I hated it.

1:02:27.482 --> 1:02:29.758
I'm just gonna say this.

1:02:29.758 --> 1:02:31.000
Yell at me again,
I'm gonna beat your ass.

1:02:32.689 --> 1:02:34.000
Damn.
