WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:06.716
- Are you sure you want to poke the bear?
- I want to rip his heart out.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.586
Previously on Proven Innocent...

00:18.619 --> 00:20.364
If someone needs our help,
we don't give a damn

00:20.388 --> 00:21.455
where they come from.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.257
We believe the justice system
is flawed.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.559
- The hell's going on?
- There he is.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.861
Mr. Bellows. Noah Weiss,
campaign strategist.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.373
We're gonna need to change
the entire structure

00:29.397 --> 00:30.740
- of the campaign.
- This is ridiculous.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.542
You think that you're there
for me, but really,

00:32.566 --> 00:35.369
- you just show up when you want to be the hero.
- I do not.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.181
I don't need you saving me
anymore. I'm fine on my own.

00:37.205 --> 00:40.007
Offer a deal
that sends Levi Scott

00:40.040 --> 00:41.518
to anger management counseling.
I'll do the rest.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.411
- And you can get him to talk?
- Of course.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.044
If this was speed dating,
I'd be into it.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.560
Man, this place is rocking.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.729
Really makes me rethink
my lifestyle choices.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.364
Being gay
is not a choice, Bodie.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.867
It is if you love Fox News.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.740
Ladies! I don't know
how you're pulling it off,

01:08.769 --> 01:11.905
but you are
absolutely killing it.

01:11.939 --> 01:15.209
Baby, there ain't no pulling
anything off. We tuck it in.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.544
Do you happen to know where...

01:16.577 --> 01:19.380
My God. Madeline?
Madeline Scott, is that you?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.382
Your trial was the biggest thing
around here.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.059
We cheered so loud
when you got out of prison.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.594
We cried, girl. We even had
a Madeline Scott night

01:24.618 --> 01:26.086
- at our bar.
- Cried.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.055
Everybody came dressed like you.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.666
- She even wore your hair.
- You do have my hair.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.101
- It's kind of amazing.
- I do have your hair.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.069
- You're amazing.
- What are you doing here, mama? -I'm looking

01:33.093 --> 01:35.696
for a law firm. Do you know
where Watts & Watts is?

01:35.729 --> 01:36.906
Loca, that's right
down the street

01:36.930 --> 01:38.399
and go right around the corner.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.801
- Perfect, thank you so much.
- No, baby. Where you going?

01:40.834 --> 01:42.570
Get your phone out.
We need a selfie.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.248
- Get in here.
- Girl, no one's gonna believe us.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.649
We say three,
you're gonna smile, say "yas."

01:45.673 --> 01:48.075
- Ready? One, two, three.
- Yas!

01:54.114 --> 01:56.250
Her name is Cindy Whitman.

01:56.284 --> 02:00.421
She was convicted of killing a
transgender woman back in 1982.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.756
The victim, Vanessa Evans,
was the most important

02:02.790 --> 02:05.259
trans activist of her time.

02:05.293 --> 02:08.295
Cindy is transgender herself,
and the prisons have stopped

02:08.329 --> 02:10.130
issuing her hormones
due to cutbacks.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.099
I'm suing them to get them back.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.877
I can't imagine what she's going
through. That's like having

02:13.901 --> 02:15.369
your identity ripped away.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.137
I was friends with a trans man
in prison.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.648
Taking away his testosterone
would have been like

02:18.672 --> 02:20.441
- taking away his existence.
- Exactly.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.118
And to get her hormones back,
I have to prove

02:22.142 --> 02:23.277
how long she's been on them.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.821
I confirmed with the doctor
that she's been

02:24.845 --> 02:27.948
taking them since the late '70s,
which led me

02:27.981 --> 02:30.050
to a really interesting
discovery.

02:30.083 --> 02:33.887
The blood at the crime scene
matched Cindy's blood type,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.289
which is AB negative.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.957
It's the rarest blood type.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.560
Right, only 0.6%
of the population has it.

02:39.593 --> 02:43.130
At the time, it was primarily
what they used to convict her.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.741
But I just discovered
from the lab reports

02:44.765 --> 02:47.501
that the hormone levels
in the blood

02:47.535 --> 02:49.403
were significantly lower
than that of someone

02:49.437 --> 02:51.677
- who is transitioning.
- So the blood at the crime scene

02:51.705 --> 02:53.006
couldn't have been Cindy's.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.651
I think we have grounds here
to reopen this case.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.843
I'd say so.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.678
Which leads me
to another problem,

02:57.711 --> 02:58.988
but I think
you're the perfect person

02:59.012 --> 03:01.014
- to help me with it.
- Why is that?

03:01.048 --> 03:03.517
Cindy doesn't want
to get out of jail.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.524
Imagine you are looking
at yourself in the mirror.

03:10.558 --> 03:14.762
It sounds like you
and it looks like you.

03:14.795 --> 03:18.766
But deep down, you know
this isn't your true self.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.369
On this week's episode
of Until Proven Innocent,

03:21.402 --> 03:24.037
we'll explore what happens
when one dares

03:24.071 --> 03:27.174
to finally live in their truth,

03:27.207 --> 03:32.179
knowing that so many in the
world will hate them for it.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.616
I know I'm not much
to look at now,

03:35.649 --> 03:38.185
but you should have seen me
back in the day.

03:38.218 --> 03:42.856
Lord Jesus, I was fabulous.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.191
You're still fabulous.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.526
Really, sweetie?

03:45.559 --> 03:46.860
I swear on the Bible.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.696
Hell.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.498
The religious boys,
they love me.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.566
Honey, the bigger the Bible,
the bigger the closet.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.102
They were always
chasing after me.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.537
Tell us about Vanessa.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.640
Vanessa Evans was our hero.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.944
She was one of the bravest trans
activists I knew back then.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.713
Ness held it down.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.549
Police report said you got
in a fight the night she died,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.050
that it was a lover's quarrel.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.885
Yeah.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.922
Because they thought we were
queer men and not women.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.057
Vanessa and I,
we were never lovers.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.892
She was like a sister to me.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.894
But the cops saw me
as trans-trash,

04:20.928 --> 04:22.396
so they threw the book at me.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.465
Well... thanks
to what Garrett found,

04:24.498 --> 04:26.900
- we think you have a real shot.
- At getting my hormones?

04:26.934 --> 04:28.669
At getting
your conviction overturned.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.270
You shouldn't have
to suffer in jail

04:30.304 --> 04:31.905
for a crime you didn't commit.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.907
You know,
the real suffering happened

04:33.941 --> 04:36.243
when I had to live
my life as Steve.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.912
That was torture every day.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.849
And that torture's coming back
if I don't get my hormones.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.085
Cindy, why don't
you want to get out?

04:45.118 --> 04:47.788
'Cause there's nothing
out there for me.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.924
Everyone I knew is gone.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.427
AIDS, hate crimes, suicide.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.464
40% of trans folks are trying
to kill themselves.

04:56.497 --> 05:00.200
40%. Can you imagine
if that number was that high

05:00.233 --> 05:03.337
for any other group of people?
Honey, there'd be a telethon

05:03.371 --> 05:05.105
around the clock.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.541
No. I'd rather stay in here.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.110
But if you really want
to help me,

05:10.143 --> 05:13.180
if you really want to help me,

05:13.213 --> 05:16.384
get me my hormones, please.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.352
Because I'll die without them.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.972
It's as if I've never done this
before or something.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.509
Wow, I'm a little nervous.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.976
I totally get that.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.012
- I get nervous.
- No, you don't.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.490
Nervous means like, you know,
you're in the game, like,

05:46.514 --> 05:47.748
nervous means you want to win.

05:47.781 --> 05:48.916
Being nervous is good.

05:48.949 --> 05:52.185
Okay. Right. Nervous is good.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.488
- Nervous is good.
- I'll just be nervous all the time.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.357
- That's the spirit.
- Okay, um...

05:58.459 --> 06:02.763
Our guest today
is podcasting icon

06:02.796 --> 06:06.166
- and my personal hero Ira Glass.
- Glad to be here.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.569
"Podcasting icon" is such,
like, a funny thing to say.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.103
Like, I'm this "icon"
of this thing

06:10.137 --> 06:11.577
that most people
have never heard of.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.611
One of the biggest
challenges in podcasting

06:17.645 --> 06:21.048
is balancing the story
that you're actually telling

06:21.081 --> 06:23.851
with some kind of
bigger meaning or message,

06:23.884 --> 06:26.420
which is something
you do effortlessly.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.231
- What's your secret?
- I mean, honestly, we just try

06:28.255 --> 06:29.899
to tell the plot
of what happened to a person,

06:29.923 --> 06:33.226
and then, ideally,
they are the one who have

06:33.260 --> 06:35.262
the bigger thought or idea
about what it means.

06:35.295 --> 06:38.198
Um, and then if they don't,
like, then the host or reporter

06:38.231 --> 06:39.543
can jump in
and give that meaning.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.535
There's a really amazing example

06:41.569 --> 06:44.371
that I just heard where it was
this story of this 14-year-old,

06:44.404 --> 06:46.206
who, who the police
would treat as an adult

06:46.239 --> 06:47.941
because he looked
just like an adult.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.553
And then the host
is the one who jumps in

06:49.577 --> 06:51.044
with this really
beautiful thought

06:51.078 --> 06:52.880
about how deceptive
appearances can be.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.718
You're talking about my show.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.896
Yes, I am talking about
your show. Yes, congratulations,

06:59.920 --> 07:01.421
you recognize your own show.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.957
Yeah, you're doing
such a nice job.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.259
Thanks again

07:06.293 --> 07:07.637
- for doing this.
- Totally glad to do it.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.096
And for pretending to be a fan.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.898
- That was nice.
- I'm not pretending.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.299
Your show's really good.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.501
Thanks.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.003
Hey, okay, so, I fly out of here
in a couple days.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.404
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.907
Um... I guess I'm,

07:19.940 --> 07:21.975
I'm doing whatever it is
that you are doing.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.745
You're funny.
Um, do you want to have dinner?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.581
I-I, um, I do.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.158
I do want to have dinner.
That would be nice.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.418
- That's great. Okay, so, I will be in touch.
- Okay.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.921
- We will make arrangements, the way that adults do.
- Yeah.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.190
- Good. All right, great. Okay.
- Great. Thanks.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.598
So our first goal
is to reframe you

07:44.632 --> 07:47.367
into what I call
a hero campaign.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.836
We lean into
your incredible bio,

07:48.869 --> 07:51.138
display images of you
looking heroic.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.641
Here you are as the man
who saved Chicago.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.276
A loving husband,
American as apple pie.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.444
Tested great in the burbs.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.348
This one says Gore Bellows
is the law.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.185
- Powerful.
- Yeah.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.521
- Forceful.
- Absolutely.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.989
Makes me look like a winner.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.291
Which you are, sir.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.293
Best part is it makes
the campaign about me,

08:13.326 --> 08:14.995
instead of the Scott case.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.806
Mayfield was always obsessed
with how Madeline's press

08:16.830 --> 08:19.066
was affecting my numbers.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.977
Yeah, I don't want to say
anything negative about him,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.012
'cause he's a great guy,
but he's an amateur and a hack

08:23.036 --> 08:24.805
who will lead you
to a crushing defeat.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.174
All right, fighting Madeline
Scott... going tit for tat...

08:27.207 --> 08:30.410
It puts her at your level,
and she is not.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.312
She's a murderer.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.347
- You really believe that?
- I always did.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.518
I knew you were my guy.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.197
So you think
I should just ignore her?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.355
I do, I do.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.157
I mean, unless...

08:44.191 --> 08:45.693
Unless what?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.170
Well, attacking her
would be a disaster,

08:47.194 --> 08:49.029
but if you had new evidence...

08:50.230 --> 08:51.364
of her guilt...

08:53.567 --> 08:56.103
I mean, then you would win
in a landslide.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.173
You mean,
recharge her for murder?

09:00.207 --> 09:03.243
Only if you had new evidence.

09:04.878 --> 09:09.382
If you had it, you would
dominate every news cycle.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.697
I believe she's innocent, but
if she doesn't want our help...

09:23.731 --> 09:26.433
Prison is a hopeless place, we
just need to give her some hope.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.036
So, what, we go against
her wishes and do it anyway?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.280
It's not even ethical to assume
representation for a client

09:31.304 --> 09:32.806
without their consent.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.017
Then let's find
some new evidence,

09:34.041 --> 09:35.375
give her a reason to say yes.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.544
2018 was one
of the most violent years

09:37.577 --> 09:40.213
in history
for transgender women.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.425
This could be an amazing case to
shine a light on those issues.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.484
We can't take the case
of someone who doesn't

09:44.517 --> 09:45.753
want to be exonerated.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.387
Are you uncomfortable
with this case?

09:47.420 --> 09:51.424
No. I'd gladly move forward
if she actually wanted our help.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.836
Well, she does,
she doesn't know it yet.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.762
Come on, let's dig around.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.475
Let's give her a reason
to change her mind.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.272
Amazing, isn't it?

10:05.305 --> 10:07.574
All the hatred
for this community.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.786
All they want to do is just live
their lives for who they are.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.579
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.581
Does the black community
share any connection

10:14.614 --> 10:17.250
with the gay community for being
targeted by hate groups?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.586
Some might say yes because
we both know what it's like

10:19.619 --> 10:21.588
to be hated
for being who you are,

10:21.621 --> 10:24.591
and we're both generally hated
by the same people.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.459
But others say
you can hide who you love,

10:26.493 --> 10:28.461
but you can't hide
the color of your skin.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.476
But what do you do when
you can't hide who you love?

10:53.821 --> 10:55.455
No way Cindy killed her.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.125
Cops will pin anything
they can on queer people.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.961
- Did you own the bar then?
- No, I was just a server.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.796
It was mob-owned,
like most gay bars.

11:02.830 --> 11:06.967
They walked away in '98 and
someone had to keep it alive.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.635
This bar was special.
A safe haven,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.013
where everyone
could be themselves.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.571
Everyone?

11:11.604 --> 11:14.007
My understanding
is not all gay bars

11:14.041 --> 11:16.643
were welcoming
of the trans community.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.812
This wasn't
most gay bars, honey.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.414
This was the Tulip.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.649
Vanessa was an icon.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.517
A true hero.

11:24.551 --> 11:27.387
Everybody loved her.
Except the cops.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.989
- Why is that?
- The usual.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.691
Thought she was a he
and a pervert.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.161
If they weren't harassing her,
they were putting her in cuffs

11:34.194 --> 11:37.064
for prostitution,
and believe me, she wasn't.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.666
- Walking while trans.
- That's right, honey.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.335
You look visibly trans
on the street,

11:42.369 --> 11:43.780
cops cuff and say
you're a prostitute.

11:43.804 --> 11:47.007
In my community,
it's walking while black.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.176
Now imagine being
black and trans.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.854
'Cause that's what these girls
had to live with.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.680
I remember a few days
before she was killed,

11:53.713 --> 11:56.216
some jerk accosted Vanessa.
He was obsessed with her.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.186
And when she called it off,
he went after her.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.055
Then the cops arrest Vanessa
for assault.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.623
Do you know who this guy was?

12:03.656 --> 12:05.993
No, but I'll ask around.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.061
A few of us are still alive
from those days.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.630
A few.

12:17.604 --> 12:18.738
You wanted to see me?

12:18.772 --> 12:20.207
Yes, come on in. Come on in.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.143
So... this is the big day.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.878
Your first day in court.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.479
It's just a P.C. hearing.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.048
First P.C. hearing in court.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.550
Here. Congratulations.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.920
I'm very proud
of all your accomplishments.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.754
I love it.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.157
- Thank you.
- You deserve it.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.391
Come have a seat.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.328
So, tell me about Levi Scott.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.439
Are you still attending that
anger management class with him?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.232
Levi's a tough nut to crack.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.734
He keeps to himself, mostly.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.569
You just got to get him
to loosen up.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.737
Find out what he likes.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.641
I bet it's you.
Who knows... maybe,

12:54.674 --> 12:56.552
if he can give you
some evidence that might help

12:56.576 --> 12:59.312
reopen Rosemary's murder case...

12:59.346 --> 13:01.915
you could find yourself
sitting second chair

13:01.949 --> 13:03.984
in the biggest trial
of the year.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.887
Understood.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.261
Vanessa had a few stalkers.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.429
The straight boys loved her.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.632
And when they couldn't keep her
it could get violent.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.101
You have any idea
who attacked her

13:21.134 --> 13:22.936
- when she was charged for assault?
- Honey...

13:22.970 --> 13:25.372
everybody harassed us.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.941
Cops, neighbors,
drunkards, robbers,

13:27.975 --> 13:29.442
even family.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.810
Everybody hated us.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.946
We're just trying to find
an alternative suspect.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.882
It's the key to getting you out.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.625
Well, what's the key
to getting my hormones?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.785
Cindy, you deserve your hormones
and so much more.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.387
Let us help you
get out of prison.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.123
- Then you're free to get the hormones you need.
- But like I said,

13:43.156 --> 13:44.791
I've got no one out there.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.459
The gays hate us.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.171
The lesbians don't want
anything to do with us,

13:48.195 --> 13:50.035
and the straights
don't even think we're human.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.968
All of my friends are gone.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.471
There's not one single person
in the world for me.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.340
I'm better off in here.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.675
But this isn't freedom.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.077
Your life's not your own,

14:04.111 --> 14:06.980
and even though the idea
of being free is scary,

14:07.014 --> 14:09.416
it is your right
because you're innocent.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.818
I won't say it's gonna be easy.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.420
But a year from now,

14:13.453 --> 14:15.555
maybe two, maybe three...

14:17.324 --> 14:19.435
you're gonna start to wake up
with tears in your eyes

14:19.459 --> 14:21.929
that your life is your own.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.832
Why are you being so nice to me?

14:25.865 --> 14:28.701
Because I suffered
for ten years in prison.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.940
Just like that man over there
alleviated my pain,

14:32.973 --> 14:35.275
I vowed that I would
do the same for others.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.746
Cindy, let us help you.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.214
Let us stand next to you
and fight.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.567
All right... fine.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.736
Let's do it.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.214
- Lord.
- Who is it?

15:14.247 --> 15:16.583
- Judge Speer.
- Lord.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.419
- Ms. Scott.
- It's good to see you again, Your Honor.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.088
I wish I could say
the same for you.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.689
Thank you, Your Honor.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.392
The justice system
is based on the principle

15:25.425 --> 15:27.427
that all people are treated
equally under the law.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.895
That principle was violated

15:28.928 --> 15:30.263
at Cindy Whitman's
original trial.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we have
on the docket here

15:31.764 --> 15:34.434
a Steven Whitman, not Cindy.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.578
Your Honor, that's my point.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.404
- The Constitution...
- Ms. Scott,

15:37.437 --> 15:38.481
you're my first case of the day.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.906
Let the coffee kick in
before you

15:39.939 --> 15:41.341
go full Atticus Finch on me.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.509
What's your issue?

15:42.542 --> 15:44.744
Your Honor...

15:44.777 --> 15:47.447
we move for a new trial
in the interest of justice

15:47.480 --> 15:50.083
on the basis of overwhelming
new evidence

15:50.117 --> 15:52.652
of the Chicago PD's bias against
the transgendered community

15:52.685 --> 15:54.321
- in the '80s.
- Lovely history lesson,

15:54.354 --> 15:56.389
but you seem to have left out

15:56.423 --> 15:59.426
the Chicago PD's investigation
into your client.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.804
In addition to exculpatory blood
evidence already before you,

16:01.828 --> 16:03.630
the hormone levels
in the blood at the scene

16:03.663 --> 16:05.541
did not reflect someone
who was transitioning...

16:05.565 --> 16:06.775
Do these blood samples
still exist?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.435
They do not, Your Honor.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.103
Motion for a new trial denied.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.305
Then we request,
at the very least,

16:12.339 --> 16:13.940
post-conviction discovery,

16:13.973 --> 16:16.609
in the form of access
to the police files

16:16.643 --> 16:17.610
to explore the possibility.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.712
Fine. Motion granted.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.115
But then again...

16:22.149 --> 16:23.950
that's what you wanted
all along,

16:23.983 --> 16:25.585
- isn't it, Ms. Scott?
- Maybe.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.221
Next case.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.295
How nice of them
to bury us in paperwork.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.629
Yeah, and literally none of it

16:36.663 --> 16:38.565
has anything to do
with our case.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.966
The arrest date
was July 14, right?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.868
Yeah.
Yeah. I have an arrest report here

16:41.901 --> 16:45.338
for Debbie Urmand,
same date, same charge.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.707
- It's a codefendant?
- Same arresting officers.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.776
If Debbie was there,
she might be able to tell us

16:49.809 --> 16:51.811
who the guy was.
If she's still alive.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.081
I found a Debbie Urmand.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.983
She manages a drag club
called Medusa's Den.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.651
I think there's
a slightly good chance

16:58.685 --> 17:00.487
that that is the same person.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.822
This is gonna be fun.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.491
Can't wait.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.046
All right, let's go.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.118
It was another world back then.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.786
You didn't show your true colors

18:06.819 --> 18:08.755
unless you were willing
to pay the price.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.090
On the night of July 14,
you were arrested

18:11.124 --> 18:12.892
with another woman,
Vanessa Evans.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.196
- The police say you both attacked the victim.
- Yeah, right...

18:16.229 --> 18:19.899
We attacked him. Sure.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.768
I was working

18:21.801 --> 18:23.403
when Vanessa saw me on my corner

18:23.436 --> 18:25.071
and she came to say hi.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.240
It wasn't but five minutes
when some guy

18:27.274 --> 18:29.642
came out of nowhere, jumped us.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.612
So it was a stranger
who attacked you?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.414
Not someone Vanessa knew?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.616
That's right.
Sh-She didn't know him.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.387
Do you remember
anything about him?

18:40.420 --> 18:43.756
No. It was a long time ago.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.758
And one of many.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.529
You said you were working
on your corner.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.597
Were you working working?

18:50.630 --> 18:54.267
Only way to pay
the bills, sweetheart.

18:54.301 --> 18:58.771
I couldn't pass...
so I couldn't get a job.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.808
Some of the girls were lucky
enough to find sugar daddies.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.276
Guys on the down-low...

19:04.477 --> 19:06.213
but not me.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.714
Vanessa had someone, right?

19:07.747 --> 19:10.817
Many.
The straight boys loved her.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.453
- Anyone around the time she was killed?
- Yeah.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.121
Sam Marshall.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.790
He was obsessed with her.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.461
Lost it a little
when she called it off.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.996
Big finance guys
don't like to be told no.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.541
And I like that part.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.977
- Hey!
- Hey.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.347
Die of AIDS, faggots.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.151
Call the cops!

19:45.184 --> 19:46.853
- Are you okay?
- Someone call the police!

19:49.756 --> 19:52.325
You're not gonna need stitches.
You got lucky.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.160
An inch lower and you
could've lost your eye.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.997
So you didn't get the license?

19:58.030 --> 20:00.767
No. It-it... Look, it all
happened so fast.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.345
Can you guys not check
the neighborhood cameras,

20:02.369 --> 20:03.436
get their license plate?

20:03.470 --> 20:05.505
Yeah, we'll get right on that.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.950
- You're not gonna do anything, are you?
- Sir, please stay calm.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.453
- Listen, I'm not even gay and I'm pissed off.
- Of course you're not, sir.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.780
- You're wasting your time getting angry.
- Excuse me, sir.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.024
- We're taking a police report.
- Can you at least show her some respect

20:16.048 --> 20:17.216
and refer to her as ma'am?

20:17.250 --> 20:19.286
And you'll refer to me
as Officer Thompson.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.196
All right, all right.
We get it. You don't care.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.222
Let's just get out of here.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.301
So I have a Sam Marshall
of a Marshall Financial Group

20:34.334 --> 20:36.536
- on Michigan Avenue.
- Is that the guy?

20:36.569 --> 20:39.639
- That looks like a DL sugar daddy.
- And you would know?

20:39.672 --> 20:42.575
- I could be DL. I could never be a sugar daddy.
- I believe that.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.719
- That I couldn't be a sugar daddy?
- Yeah.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.023
Because you don't
have any money.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.881
Mr. Marshall's office.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.293
Hi, may I please speak
to Sam Marshall?

20:50.317 --> 20:51.718
It's Madeline Scott calling

20:51.751 --> 20:52.995
from the Injustice
Defense Group.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.722
- It's a legal matter.
- Hold, please.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.391
This is Sam Marshall.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.060
Hi, Mr. Marshall.
This is Madeline Scott.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.431
We have a few questions for you
about Vanessa Evans.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.366
I don't know who that is.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.536
We think you do.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.438
Don't contact me ever again.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.475
I think someone
just put "suspect"

21:15.508 --> 21:17.477
above their head
in flashing lights.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.291
Isabel?

21:35.828 --> 21:37.163
Hey.

21:39.231 --> 21:42.234
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.038
Okay, maybe I'm not fine.

21:46.072 --> 21:49.275
But that's why
we're here, right?

21:49.308 --> 21:52.044
- Right. Right, yeah.
- It's just...

21:52.078 --> 21:54.381
coming here, sometimes...

21:54.414 --> 21:56.315
makes me more sad.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.852
Yeah.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.956
Why don't we do something
not sad?

22:03.990 --> 22:06.192
What do you mean?

22:07.259 --> 22:09.362
I don't know.

22:09.396 --> 22:11.297
Let's get out of here.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.832
Come on.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.543
Sam Marshall?

22:23.576 --> 22:24.777
Hi, I'm Madeline Scott.

22:24.811 --> 22:25.912
We spoke on the phone.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.147
This is my partner,
Easy Boudreau.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.517
I asked you
not to reach out to me.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.019
Crazy enough, that made us
want to talk to you even more.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.354
- I don't have to talk to you.
- Of course not.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.989
But if you don't,

22:37.023 --> 22:38.725
we'll ask
your friends and coworkers

22:38.758 --> 22:40.268
if they knew about
your relationship with Vanessa.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.028
Probably more beneficial

22:42.061 --> 22:43.696
to talk to us directly,
don't you think?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.717
It was very long ago.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.887
- Are you still married?
- Wife passed away two years ago.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.556
Pancreatic cancer.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.123
- Sorry to hear.
- Thank you.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.225
I have children,
I have grandchildren.

23:13.259 --> 23:17.363
I cannot have anyone
find out about Vanessa.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.566
We have no interest in exposing
your personal life.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.477
We're just trying to find out
what happened to her.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.570
I have no idea
what happened to her.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.405
I was in New York
that night for work.

23:26.439 --> 23:29.208
I left that morning,
which I can probably prove.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.843
Came back the next day.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.545
I didn't even hear
about her murder

23:32.579 --> 23:34.581
until the next week.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.749
We hadn't seen each other
in months.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.551
We were told that you had.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.062
That she'd recently
broken up with you

23:40.086 --> 23:41.554
and you were
really upset about it.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.389
Please.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.558
She didn't break up with me.
I ended it.

23:45.592 --> 23:48.495
Okay? It was a very strange
time in my life

23:48.528 --> 23:51.297
and it was 37 years ago.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.566
So I hope that this was helpful

23:53.600 --> 23:55.768
and I sincerely hope
that I never see

23:55.802 --> 23:58.037
either of you ever again.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.547
I think he's lying.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.751
He wasn't lying.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.128
He e-mailed us
his credit card statements

24:13.152 --> 24:14.621
from 37 years ago.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.689
He says he kept them all
for 45 years.

24:16.723 --> 24:19.001
- Only a finance guy would do that.
- Yeah, and there were charges

24:19.025 --> 24:21.360
from New York City
on the night of the murder.

24:21.393 --> 24:22.595
Which gives him a tight alibi.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.963
But that doesn't mean he didn't

24:23.996 --> 24:25.932
kill her that day
before he left.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.876
Plus, he could have falsified
his credit card statements.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.436
Also, someone else could have
been using the card that night.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.806
Exactly. But what's really,
really interesting is...

24:33.840 --> 24:37.143
these hospital charges
from Mount Carmel ER.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.311
Two days after the murder.
Check this out.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.789
He could have cut himself
at the crime scene

24:40.813 --> 24:43.049
and then, a couple days later,
the wound hasn't healed

24:43.082 --> 24:44.784
so he goes to the ER
for stitches.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.787
And if he killed Vanessa,
then his blood

24:47.820 --> 24:49.956
would've been the other one
found at the crime scene.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.158
We should check to see
if he's the rare AB negative.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.060
Let's do it.
We'll get a court order,

24:54.093 --> 24:56.138
- subpoena his records.
- All right, I definitely think

24:56.162 --> 24:58.330
that our stockbroker douchebag
is the best bet.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.667
But I did find some really
interesting information

25:00.700 --> 25:04.070
about our bartender,
Thomas Stone.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.038
Okay, so, he talked about
how the trans community

25:06.072 --> 25:08.240
was always welcome
at the Tulip, right?

25:08.274 --> 25:10.076
To quote Dick Cheney,
"Big time."

25:10.109 --> 25:12.845
A safe haven where everyone
could be themselves.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.581
It was a haven, all right.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.716
A haven of anti-trans sentiment.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.627
Found a dozen quotes
from Thomas back in the day,

25:18.651 --> 25:21.487
all of them distancing
the gay community

25:21.520 --> 25:22.755
from the trans community.

25:22.789 --> 25:25.491
Some of them, he even attacks
Vanessa head-on.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.993
In this one he says,

25:27.026 --> 25:28.671
"She was a she-male
that was the worst thing

25:28.695 --> 25:30.329
to happen to gay rights."

25:30.362 --> 25:31.831
Damn, that's harsh.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.766
Well, I think we need
to talk to Thomas.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.504
I got us shots.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.575
- That's probably not a good idea.
- Come on.

25:42.609 --> 25:45.344
Just one shot. Remember,
today's Don't Be Sad Day.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.314
Okay, one shot.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.452
Let's do another one.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.054
- No.
- One more shot.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.693
Listening to your podcast,
I had to wonder,

26:00.727 --> 26:02.361
okay, so you're making
these things,

26:02.394 --> 26:03.863
you're churning them out
by yourself?

26:03.896 --> 26:06.298
So, are you just,
like, working all the time?

26:06.332 --> 26:07.767
Well, I throw myself
into my work

26:07.800 --> 26:09.368
because I barely have
a personal life.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.904
Seriously?
Like, I would think, like,

26:11.938 --> 26:13.372
you're smart
and you're idealistic

26:13.405 --> 26:15.245
and you're attractive,
like, I would just think

26:15.274 --> 26:17.443
men must throw themselves
at you.

26:17.476 --> 26:18.945
Yeah, well...

26:18.978 --> 26:21.413
yeah, I guess I do all right.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.415
And what about you?

26:23.449 --> 26:24.984
Are you seeing someone?

26:25.017 --> 26:26.318
My God. Yes.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.254
You would love her.
She is, like,

26:28.287 --> 26:30.823
very interesting all the time.

26:30.857 --> 26:33.025
She's incredible,
she's incredible.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.228
That's incredible.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.397
That's...
that's like that TV show.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.832
That's Incredible!,
it's like that.

26:39.866 --> 26:42.068
It's... That's... incredible.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.102
Yeah, totally.

26:45.638 --> 26:48.274
All right, so... Ira...

26:49.308 --> 26:50.977
why did you want to have dinner?

26:51.010 --> 26:52.244
Okay, it's very exciting.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.346
My team, we have this idea
for a new podcast.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.515
It's criminal justice,
it's very ambitious.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.450
And we think you would be
the perfect host.

26:58.484 --> 27:01.587
I'm here to offer you a job.
It would be your own show.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.256
Wh...

27:04.290 --> 27:06.793
I don't know what to say.
That's-that's...

27:06.826 --> 27:08.594
This would be
a dream come true for me.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.996
And we would get more listeners

27:10.029 --> 27:12.364
- for Until Proven Innocent.
- This would be

27:12.398 --> 27:14.366
a full-time thing.
I'm so sorry, you would...

27:14.400 --> 27:16.435
you would have to quit
Until Proven Innocent.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.204
You'd have to move
to New York City.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.172
This could be a really big show.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.175
Yeah, but I don't think
I can just...

27:23.209 --> 27:24.310
Just think about it, okay?

27:24.343 --> 27:26.445
This is a really big
opportunity.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.847
Think about it.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.059
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.484
To that.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.127
Hi, Thomas.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.995
- Hello.
- Back so soon?

27:43.029 --> 27:45.631
We need to talk about the truth
between you and Vanessa.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.710
You said this was a place
where everyone was accepted.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.736
You meant everyone
but the trans community, right?

27:49.769 --> 27:52.638
Because you're quoted all over
articles from the '80s

27:52.671 --> 27:55.374
attacking them and Vanessa.

27:55.407 --> 27:58.477
Look, you got to understand
what was going on back then.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.213
Cops were raiding gay bars,
beating us up.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.015
Stonewall didn't change
how they treated us.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.985
So, we started
a gay and lesbian alliance

28:06.018 --> 28:07.820
- to protect us.
- And who was supposed

28:07.854 --> 28:09.388
to protect the trans community?

28:10.522 --> 28:12.491
At the time, a lot
of gay people felt that

28:12.524 --> 28:15.061
the trans community
was holding us back

28:15.094 --> 28:16.829
from equal rights.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.330
Straight people
saw them as freaks

28:18.364 --> 28:20.666
and... so did some of us.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.434
Believe me, I wish
I could take it back.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.379
Did you and Vanessa
have a fight before she died?

28:24.403 --> 28:26.281
Me and Ness argued
every time we saw each other,

28:26.305 --> 28:28.407
- but...
- What were you arguing about?

28:29.475 --> 28:31.443
We got into it at the bar.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.946
She was yelling
and throwing a fit.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.415
She could be a real drama queen
when she wanted to be.

28:36.448 --> 28:39.251
She was furious because
we told her not to speak

28:39.285 --> 28:40.787
at a pride rally.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.756
I have been beaten,
I've had my nose broken,

28:43.790 --> 28:45.524
I've been thrown in jail.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.693
I've lost my job
for gay liberation.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.528
I've got as much right
to speak at that rally

28:49.561 --> 28:50.729
as anyone else does.

28:50.763 --> 28:51.940
I'm not going anywhere, Thomas,

28:51.964 --> 28:53.399
and if you think
just for one second

28:53.432 --> 28:55.234
that we're gonna roll over
and die,

28:55.267 --> 28:56.769
think again.

28:59.305 --> 29:02.074
That was the last time
I ever saw her.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.110
What did you do after she left?

29:04.143 --> 29:05.711
I-I was here all night.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.380
And I got a dozen people
who can testify to that.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.582
No one could ever forget
the night Ness died,

29:10.616 --> 29:12.584
and we never will.

29:12.618 --> 29:15.454
Look, I hated Vanessa...

29:15.487 --> 29:17.556
back in the day.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.558
But I would never kill her.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.560
- And why is that?
- Because she was

29:21.593 --> 29:23.896
my sister-in-arms.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.833
Even when I hated her,
I loved her.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.267
And I always will.

29:35.441 --> 29:36.852
Of course, we call it
a Revolutionary War,

29:36.876 --> 29:39.245
but really, it's a civil war,
if you think...

29:39.278 --> 29:40.913
Okay, so I've got bad news

29:40.947 --> 29:43.950
- and I've got bad news. What do you want first?
- The bad news.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.928
Judge hates my guts, denied
our motion for Sam Marshall's

29:45.952 --> 29:48.955
hospital records. She said
it was a fishing expedition.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.790
- Okay, how about the bad news?
- We don't have any other suspects.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.926
I don't buy Thomas did it.
His motive's weak,

29:53.960 --> 29:56.762
and he's got witnesses
to corroborate his alibi.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.107
That brings us back to Sam
Marshall, who also has an alibi.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.532
And he's definitely got motive.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.268
I agree. He's our best bet.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.103
And if his blood type
is AB negative,

30:04.136 --> 30:06.105
that might be enough to
get Cindy out. Okay.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.539
So let's subpoena Sam Marshall,

30:07.573 --> 30:09.108
hammer it out of him
on the stand.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.618
Yeah, but what
if he testifies to being

30:10.642 --> 30:13.112
a different blood type?
Then we're dead.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.347
Or maybe there's another way
we can get his blood type.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.583
Pray tell.

30:17.616 --> 30:20.119
It's not exactly legal, so maybe
I shouldn't say anything.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.989
- I didn't hear that.
- I never had this conversation.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.959
- Boston Tea Party.
- Hey.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.694
No, think about
the Boston Tea Party.

30:28.727 --> 30:30.407
What are we dumping?
Are we dumping coffee?

30:32.664 --> 30:35.634
I know my own stuff
is hard enough to deal with,

30:35.667 --> 30:38.170
but I have no idea
how you do it publicly.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.006
You're so resilient.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.174
And that article...

30:42.208 --> 30:44.576
Does Madeline really think
that you killed Rosemary?

30:44.610 --> 30:46.212
I don't know.

30:48.614 --> 30:51.650
I find it a bit ironic that...

30:51.683 --> 30:54.320
that she thinks
that I did it, but...

30:54.353 --> 30:55.721
Why?

31:01.260 --> 31:02.962
You can tell me.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.830
I won't say anything.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.034
Group code of silence.

31:11.603 --> 31:16.175
The night that-that Rosemary
was killed,

31:16.208 --> 31:19.578
before we even knew
that she was dead,

31:19.611 --> 31:22.814
everybody's looking for her...

31:22.848 --> 31:25.051
except for Madeline.

31:25.084 --> 31:28.220
- What?
- She was-she was just acting so strange.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.924
You know, like she was-she was
high or something.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.895
Just looking straight ahead
in a haze.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.370
So she didn't help you look?

31:44.403 --> 31:46.038
No, that's the weird thing.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.974
Something was definitely wrong.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.911
Do you think that Madeline might
have done something to Rosemary?

31:55.347 --> 31:56.715
No.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.385
I just never understood

31:59.418 --> 32:02.221
why she's acting so strange,
you know?

32:02.254 --> 32:06.125
Before anybody even knew
that-that Rosemary was killed.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.169
This isn't exactly
the "let's just be friends" pact

32:17.203 --> 32:18.404
we just made.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.807
I know. I can't help it.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.645
Me neither.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.820
Okay, we have to stop or they're
gonna throw me out of here.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.955
No, they won't.
I took care of it.

32:36.989 --> 32:41.760
You've always had
this place wired.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.830
But maybe not for long.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.898
Why? What do you mean?

32:48.134 --> 32:51.270
My parole board hearing got set.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.116
My lawyer actually thinks
I'm gonna have a shot

32:54.140 --> 32:56.108
of getting out of here.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.678
Wren, that's amazing.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.447
Is it?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.115
Of course it is.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.451
Madeline...

33:05.484 --> 33:07.819
let's be real.

33:07.853 --> 33:10.156
Do you really see us
together out there?

33:10.189 --> 33:13.225
Like, hanging with your pals,
meeting your folks?

33:14.293 --> 33:16.295
Yeah, I do.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.664
Okay then.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.668
How many people
have you told about me?

33:24.303 --> 33:26.972
That's what I thought.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.143
This thing we have between us...

33:31.177 --> 33:32.978
It exists only in here.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.846
I know on the outside

33:34.880 --> 33:37.649
you hide this side of you.
I'm not mad about it.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.252
I just... I don't want
to be disappointed.

33:42.888 --> 33:44.923
I don't know what's gonna
happen between us

33:44.956 --> 33:46.992
when you get out.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.660
But can we worry
about that later?

33:48.694 --> 33:51.197
All that matters is that
you get out of here.

33:53.199 --> 33:57.035
- Get out of here.
- Okay.

34:01.507 --> 34:04.076
All of the students
organized a search party.

34:04.110 --> 34:07.579
Everyone was looking.
Everyone except for her.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.350
I've been looking
at this backwards.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.784
I always thought he killed her

34:12.818 --> 34:14.286
and that Madeline
was his accomplice.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.755
I never considered that she
might've acted alone.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.559
So what now?

34:21.592 --> 34:23.061
Maybe...

34:24.795 --> 34:28.234
we make Levi Scott
our star witness.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.614
Hi.

34:43.649 --> 34:46.083
Sorry. Um, I have a court order

34:46.118 --> 34:48.719
for the medical records
of Samuel Marshall

34:48.754 --> 34:51.489
from September 17, 1982.

34:51.523 --> 34:54.226
This is not for Samuel Marshall.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.027
This is for a Betsy Miers.

34:56.061 --> 34:58.897
My God, really?

34:58.930 --> 35:02.434
I brought the wrong one,
and I drove an hour to get here.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.571
You want to save me
a two-hour drive?

35:05.604 --> 35:08.940
It's from 37 years ago. I don't
even think he's still alive.

35:08.974 --> 35:10.609
Do you mind?

35:10.642 --> 35:12.744
I'll get you a coffee
or a doughnut.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.913
All right, let me check.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.655
Excuse me?

35:23.689 --> 35:25.757
You gave me the wrong file.
It's his wife's.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.759
It's S. Marshall,

35:27.793 --> 35:29.795
but the "S" is for Sharon,
not for Samuel.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.863
Okay, let me look again.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.646
Mr. Marshall, can you describe
your relationship

35:47.679 --> 35:49.348
with Vanessa Evans?

35:49.381 --> 35:51.417
I wouldn't call it
a relationship.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.618
What would you call it, then?

35:54.620 --> 35:55.663
Please remember
you're under oath.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.789
- We were friends.
- As friends,

35:57.823 --> 36:01.460
were you having a sexual
relationship with Vanessa?

36:01.493 --> 36:02.670
Objection. Leading the witness.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.130
Sustained.
Ms. Scott, your point?

36:05.163 --> 36:07.165
It's coming, Your Honor.

36:07.199 --> 36:10.035
Mr. Marshall,
what is your blood type?

36:10.068 --> 36:12.238
Objection. Relevance.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.705
Your Honor,
my client was convicted

36:13.739 --> 36:16.775
because her blood type is
AB negative, the same blood type

36:16.808 --> 36:19.678
found at the scene of the crime.
I think it's relevant to know

36:19.711 --> 36:21.947
what Mr. Marshall's
blood type is.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.450
- Please answer the question.
- Be happy to answer.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.885
My blood type is O positive.

36:26.918 --> 36:30.155
And do you happen to know
the blood type of your wife?

36:31.189 --> 36:32.458
What?

36:32.491 --> 36:35.627
Your wife.
What was her blood type?

36:35.661 --> 36:39.365
- I... don't know.
- Well, let me tell you.

36:39.398 --> 36:42.133
It was AB negative.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.670
The same blood type
found at the crime scene.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.173
It's also the rarest
blood type in the world.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.141
I would like to submit
Petitioner's Exhibit A,

36:50.175 --> 36:52.644
a copy of Sharon Marshall's
medical file

36:52.678 --> 36:55.146
proving that her blood type
was AB negative.

36:55.180 --> 36:58.384
Mr. Marshall, did your wife
murder Vanessa Evans?

37:01.086 --> 37:03.822
My client has spent
37 years behind bars

37:03.855 --> 37:05.066
for a murder she didn't commit,

37:05.090 --> 37:06.850
so will you please
tell this court the truth.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.896
For once in your life,
will you tell the truth?

37:10.929 --> 37:12.864
Your wife found out
about the affair, didn't she?

37:14.600 --> 37:15.901
Didn't she?

37:23.775 --> 37:26.244
When I came home from New York
the next day, I...

37:28.380 --> 37:31.249
found my wife
sitting on the floor.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.186
She was covered
in Vanessa's blood.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.758
My wife was not a killer.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.727
Just that when she found out
that I was...

37:43.762 --> 37:45.731
having an affair with...

37:45.764 --> 37:47.265
Vanessa...

37:49.401 --> 37:51.036
she snapped.

37:51.069 --> 37:54.540
And so you let Cindy Whitman
take the fall for a murder

37:54.573 --> 37:56.575
that your wife
was responsible for.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.245
You may as well have locked
an innocent woman

38:00.278 --> 38:01.480
in a cage yourself.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.217
Your Honor, my client

38:06.251 --> 38:08.420
has lost her life over a lie.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.456
Can she please go home now?

38:15.594 --> 38:17.128
Ms. Whitman,

38:17.162 --> 38:19.931
based on the newly-discovered
evidence presented here today,

38:19.965 --> 38:22.701
it is clear that the State
of Illinois owes you an apology.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.371
This court hereby declares you

38:25.404 --> 38:27.072
actually innocent.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.481
Does this mean
I get my hormones now?

38:35.514 --> 38:36.982
Yes, it does.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.092
You're gonna be okay out there.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.162
Sometimes it's terrifying
to show who we are

38:51.196 --> 38:53.599
to the world, but if we
keep our true identity

38:53.632 --> 38:56.301
a secret, it can mutate

38:56.334 --> 38:59.771
and form a disease
that can kill you...

38:59.805 --> 39:03.642
or, even worse,
the people around you.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.745
We have to be true to ourselves,

39:06.778 --> 39:08.647
or we could end up hurting

39:08.680 --> 39:10.816
the people we love most.

39:13.018 --> 39:16.121
- Ira, hi.
- Hey. So?

39:16.154 --> 39:18.957
Um, I've been thinking
about your job offer a lot.

39:18.990 --> 39:22.027
- Great. What do you think?
- Have a seat.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.464
- Okay.
- So I would be

39:25.497 --> 39:28.967
totally lying if I didn't say
that working for you

39:29.000 --> 39:31.369
would be a dream come true.

39:31.403 --> 39:33.672
But if I'm being honest,

39:33.705 --> 39:35.874
I'm already living my dream.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.709
I'm a wrongful
conviction advocate,

39:37.743 --> 39:40.345
I am a investigator,

39:40.378 --> 39:42.681
it turns out I'm a truth seeker.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.850
I think that I only do
the podcast

39:44.883 --> 39:47.218
so that I can shine a light
on the issues,

39:47.252 --> 39:49.655
- not so that I can be famous.
- Yeah.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.322
I want to stay here,
on the ground,

39:51.356 --> 39:53.859
working to get
innocent people released,

39:53.892 --> 39:56.194
because that is my purpose.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.330
- I hope you can understand that.
- I do, I mean,

39:59.364 --> 40:01.667
I do, totally. I mean,

40:01.700 --> 40:03.702
sort of.
I mean, it's totally great.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.871
Like, this is
your life's purpose.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.082
But maybe a big mistake?
Like, from my perspective, like,

40:08.106 --> 40:11.009
I don't know, maybe you're
making a big, terrible mistake.

40:11.042 --> 40:14.179
I don't know. But you need to do
what you need to do,

40:14.212 --> 40:17.248
and so, I-I respect that that's
what you need to do,

40:17.282 --> 40:19.918
so, um, so good luck.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.386
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.421
Obviously, from this point
forward, you know,

40:23.455 --> 40:26.758
our podcasts...
We're enemies and all, so...

40:26.792 --> 40:28.226
You know I'm kidding, right?

40:28.259 --> 40:31.029
- I do.
- Like, seriously, good luck.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.263
- Thanks.
- Okay.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.410
Did you tell him
you're not gonna do it?

40:45.443 --> 40:46.945
Yeah.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.215
Am I making a terrible mistake?

40:52.250 --> 40:54.219
I mean,

40:54.252 --> 40:56.221
I'm sure you would've had
a great time hobnobbing

40:56.254 --> 40:57.689
with the New York City elite

40:57.723 --> 40:59.758
and eating at the best
restaurants in the world,

40:59.791 --> 41:03.662
living your life like
a joyous 1950s movie montage,

41:03.695 --> 41:06.665
but if you did all that,
guess who wouldn't be there?

41:07.766 --> 41:11.302
- You.
- That's right, this guy.

41:11.336 --> 41:14.105
Yeah, I want you here,

41:14.139 --> 41:15.974
but this firm needs you here.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.076
And as the chairman
of the board said,

41:18.109 --> 41:19.811
"Chicago is my kind of town."

41:19.845 --> 41:22.447
It's my kind of town, too.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.411
How you doing, Cindy?

41:54.713 --> 41:56.682
I shouldn't even be here.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.784
I should be dead, too.

41:58.817 --> 42:01.352
We all lost so much in the fire,

42:01.386 --> 42:03.421
but we're still here.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.291
You finally down
for us girls now?

42:06.324 --> 42:09.127
I am so sorry, Cindy.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.630
We were so consumed
trying to protect ourselves,

42:11.663 --> 42:14.499
we lost sight of what
the fight was about.

42:16.501 --> 42:18.637
It's okay, sweetie.

42:18.670 --> 42:22.307
It's time for all of us queens
to move on.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.242
Welcome home, Cindy.

42:54.606 --> 42:56.007
Hey, Maddie.

42:56.041 --> 42:59.177
- Hi, Mom. How are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

42:59.210 --> 43:00.846
I'm good.

43:00.879 --> 43:03.214
I just called to tell you
that I'm bisexual

43:03.248 --> 43:04.750
and I'm dating a woman.

43:06.752 --> 43:08.553
- Mom?
- Um...

43:08.586 --> 43:12.357
th-that's very interesting.
When can we meet her?

43:12.390 --> 43:14.559
That's a bit tricky
because she's in prison,

43:14.592 --> 43:16.594
but she might be paroled soon.

43:19.564 --> 43:21.566
Mom?

43:23.001 --> 43:25.003
Mom?

44:07.012 --> 44:08.980
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH.

44:11.116 --> 44:13.127
You've seen the fight
for justice on Proven Innocent.

44:13.151 --> 44:15.520
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:17.856 --> 44:20.558
Rule number one
if you want to stay alive.

44:20.591 --> 44:22.460
Don't lie to your doctor.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.700
- Profits over patients, again.
- You save your morality lesson.

44:28.734 --> 44:30.101
You have to save him!

44:30.135 --> 44:32.170
Be careful.

44:32.203 --> 44:34.239
- You tried to kill him.
- I had no choice!

44:38.209 --> 44:39.610
Shall we?

44:42.480 --> 44:45.717
The Resident,
all new, Mondays at 800 on Fox.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.189
As they began
their hours of duty...

44:52.590 --> 44:55.393
it was a bell
that started it off.

44:56.561 --> 44:59.130
Each alarm was sounded
by a bell...
