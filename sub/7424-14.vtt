00:01.907 --> 00:04.922
<i>Nine years ago,</i>
<i>I witnessed my mother's murder.</i>

00:05.048 --> 00:08.016
<i>I would have been killed, too,</i>
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

00:08.018 --> 00:10.729
<i>I was part of an experimental</i>
<i>special forces group.</i>

00:10.983 --> 00:13.400
<i>Their goal was to create</i>
<i>the perfect super soldier.</i>

00:13.402 --> 00:16.152
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

00:16.155 --> 00:17.387
You're him.

00:17.389 --> 00:19.222
If that cop had booked you,
Muirfield

00:19.224 --> 00:20.858
would have been here
before the ink dried.

00:20.860 --> 00:22.693
There's a secret
organization that's obsessed

00:22.695 --> 00:25.228
with the same creature
you've been studying.

00:25.230 --> 00:26.396
You'll join us.

00:26.398 --> 00:28.198
After this conversation,

00:28.200 --> 00:30.951
I get a sense I'm either
with you or I'm dead.

00:30.953 --> 00:33.170
I'd like you to meet my brother.
This is Darius.

00:33.172 --> 00:34.538
Dinner?

00:36.124 --> 00:38.375
You know if I could be
with you, I would, right?

00:39.627 --> 00:41.178
While I'm standing here
waiting to hear

00:41.180 --> 00:43.263
the amazing reason
you're destroying evidence.

00:43.265 --> 00:45.349
I'll put in for a new
partner in the morning.

00:45.351 --> 00:47.718
<i>Turns out you can't control</i>
<i>your heart.</i>

00:47.720 --> 00:49.269
<i>Damn thing just does</i>
<i>what it wants.</i>

00:49.271 --> 00:51.338
Oh, my God.

00:53.541 --> 00:56.193
Okay, this is bad.

00:56.195 --> 00:57.844
It's going to be fine.
Okay, you don't...

00:57.846 --> 00:59.646
you don't understand.
My sister sees me kiss a guy,

00:59.648 --> 01:01.815
she Googles him down to
his high school yearbook.

01:01.817 --> 01:03.150
Maybe she didn't
get a good look at me.

01:03.152 --> 01:04.568
No, the lights were on.

01:04.569 --> 01:06.136
She totally saw you.

01:06.138 --> 01:09.756
Vincent, Alex saw you,
and we had to put her

01:09.758 --> 01:12.943
on a bus to get her
away from Muirfield.

01:12.945 --> 01:14.661
She had to give up
her entire life.

01:14.663 --> 01:16.580
I don't... I don't want that
for my sister.

01:16.582 --> 01:18.832
Catherine,
Alex was part of my old life.

01:18.834 --> 01:21.218
Okay, Heather knows nothing
about me.

01:21.970 --> 01:23.754
Okay.

01:23.756 --> 01:26.340
It's not like she's
ever seen you before.

01:26.342 --> 01:27.925
Right.

01:27.927 --> 01:31.995
I could just be some random guy
you picked up at a bar.

01:33.314 --> 01:35.232
I'm sure that's happened before.

01:35.234 --> 01:37.467
Yeah, all the time.

01:37.469 --> 01:39.186
Yeah.
Random guy.

01:39.188 --> 01:40.571
Never seen me before.

01:40.573 --> 01:41.905
Never see you again.

01:41.907 --> 01:45.659
Except you probably
will-- later.

01:45.661 --> 01:47.911
But right now, you should
probably, uh, go deal, yeah?

01:47.913 --> 01:49.029
Yeah.

01:49.031 --> 01:50.981
Uh, rain check.

01:54.852 --> 01:57.070
Bye.

== sync, corrected by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> ==

02:04.991 --> 02:06.942
Heather?

02:11.448 --> 02:12.614
Heath'?

02:12.616 --> 02:14.833
Hi. I am so sorry.
Hi. I am so sorry.

02:14.835 --> 02:15.786
No, no, no, it's okay.

02:15.811 --> 02:17.721
I was just so excited
about my date, and I...

02:17.722 --> 02:19.555
Oh, right, with Joe's brother.
How'd it go?

02:19.557 --> 02:20.756
Forget about my date.

02:20.758 --> 02:22.007
Who was that guy?

02:22.009 --> 02:23.842
That? That was just

02:23.844 --> 02:27.462
some random guy I met
at a bar.

02:27.464 --> 02:29.148
Some random guy?

02:29.150 --> 02:32.351
Yeah. Thank God
you came out when you did.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.738
Before I, uh,
did anything stupid.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.106
Catherine?

02:37.108 --> 02:39.658
That was Vincent
Zalanksi, wasn't it?

02:39.660 --> 02:42.144
The-the guy that you took
to Dad's wedding?

02:43.747 --> 02:46.415
I didn't bring anyone
to Dad's wedding, remember?

02:46.417 --> 02:47.950
No, I know.

02:47.952 --> 02:49.952
It's just, I saw you
dancing with some guy

02:49.954 --> 02:51.453
that looked a lot like him.

02:52.689 --> 02:54.039
He's Ass, isn't he?

02:54.041 --> 02:56.073
Who?
Ass--

02:56.450 --> 02:57.682
the guy with all
of the issues, the guy that ran

02:57.711 --> 02:59.595
back to his ex,
the one that you swore

02:59.597 --> 03:00.963
you would move on from.

03:00.965 --> 03:03.515
No wonder
why you're trying to hide him.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.134
You know, we're just...
we're still navigating,

03:05.136 --> 03:06.852
you know,
where we are exactly.

03:06.854 --> 03:10.505
Seemed like you knew where
you were about 30 minutes ago.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.026
You should invite him
to Joe's award thingy.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.944
With all of my work people?
Uh-huh.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.013
No, and you're going to be
working the entire time.

03:18.015 --> 03:20.532
You're not even going to be
able to talk to him at all.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.867
Well, I am
an assistant event planner,

03:21.869 --> 03:23.018
not a cater waiter.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.269
Once the party's going,

03:24.271 --> 03:26.071
I'll totally have time
to hang out.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.407
Okay, he's just...
he's not great in crowds.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.625
Then have him over for dinner.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.410
Heather.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.045
I'm not going to grill him.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.880
No, Catherine,
I just want to meet him.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.915
All right, a lot of people
bring their boyfriends

03:36.917 --> 03:38.750
over to meet the family.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.335
That's what
normal sisters do.

03:40.337 --> 03:43.071
I just... I feel like you're
sneaking around on me.

03:43.073 --> 03:45.007
Heath'.

03:45.009 --> 03:48.760
No, okay, look, listen, I...
I am on your side.

03:48.762 --> 03:52.598
If you like this guy,
I want to like him, too.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.817
I just don't want you
to lie to me.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.986
Okay.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.856
Okay, I will ask him.

04:00.858 --> 04:02.724
Okay.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.449
Okay, what happened
to "I'm some random guy"?

04:10.451 --> 04:13.785
She recognized you
from the wedding.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.788
She thinks you're
Vincent Zalanski,

04:16.790 --> 04:19.074
this mysterious "Ass."

04:19.076 --> 04:21.927
Ass?
Yeah, and the more

04:21.928 --> 04:24.346
of a mystery you are,
the more suspicious she gets.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.014
But if you come over for dinner,

04:26.016 --> 04:27.432
then you'll become
less mysterious.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.750
It will normalize you,

04:28.752 --> 04:31.220
and then maybe
she'll stop digging

04:31.222 --> 04:33.188
and-and we can keep her
off Muirfield's radar.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.274
Why don't you just tell her
that this Zalanski

04:35.276 --> 04:38.110
is some ass who blew you off
and disappeared

04:38.112 --> 04:40.646
into the black hole
of New York City?

04:42.365 --> 04:43.598
Because it's a lie.

04:45.068 --> 04:49.538
Vincent, I have two...
two important relationships

04:49.540 --> 04:51.823
in my life besides you.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.775
And I already lost Tess.

04:54.911 --> 04:56.378
She filed for a new partner.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.132
I just... I don't think
I can lose my sister, too.

05:00.134 --> 05:03.068
So, what,
sharing a slice is gonna

05:03.070 --> 05:05.337
alleviate all
sisterly suspicion?

05:05.339 --> 05:08.223
Yes... and from then on,

05:08.225 --> 05:10.458
you can be this nice E.R. doc

05:10.460 --> 05:13.679
who gets to hang out
<i>in</i> my apartment.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.848
Somewhere
without razor wire

05:16.850 --> 05:18.600
surrounding it.

05:18.602 --> 05:20.302
Maybe some walls.

05:20.304 --> 05:21.737
Mm-hmm.

05:21.739 --> 05:23.272
A door we can close.

05:23.274 --> 05:24.323
A door would be nice.

05:26.110 --> 05:27.475
Catherine.

05:27.477 --> 05:29.912
What's up
with your buddy Evan?

05:32.616 --> 05:34.166
Did I walk in
on something?

05:34.168 --> 05:36.084
Oh, no, just a
delivery order.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.920
So, Evan--

05:37.922 --> 05:40.122
I haven't heard from him
in a couple of days.

05:40.124 --> 05:41.990
His morgue was bugged
by Muirfield.

05:41.992 --> 05:43.292
I'm a tad worried.

05:43.294 --> 05:44.659
I wouldn't worry.

05:44.661 --> 05:46.762
I saw Evan last night,
and I think he probably

05:46.764 --> 05:48.330
just hasn't called
'cause he got dumped.

05:48.332 --> 05:50.549
Um, I'll see you tonight?

05:50.551 --> 05:53.101
Yes.

05:56.974 --> 05:59.308
Law enforcement personnel only.

05:59.310 --> 06:01.093
Actually, I'm Dr. Sorenson.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.611
I work with your girlfriend,
Claire.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.613
I think we can all
stop pretending

06:04.615 --> 06:06.331
she was ever my girlfriend.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.517
You got onto something
that's of interest to us.

06:09.519 --> 06:12.738
Apologies if it affected
your personal relationship.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.456
I've moved on.

06:16.159 --> 06:19.027
Attacking me in the middle
of a police station

06:19.029 --> 06:20.662
is probably ill-advised.

06:20.664 --> 06:22.881
Seems like
your non-girlfriend gave you

06:22.883 --> 06:24.249
the wrong impression about us.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.034
Remarkable.

06:26.036 --> 06:29.388
What you have figured out
on your own--

06:29.390 --> 06:31.256
cross-species
DNA sequencing--

06:31.258 --> 06:33.108
that took our people years.

06:34.877 --> 06:37.346
You would be an asset
to our organization.

06:37.348 --> 06:39.147
You make it sound
like I have a choice.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.548
Of course you have a choice.

06:40.550 --> 06:42.234
You think we want people
working for us

06:42.236 --> 06:44.269
who don't believe in our cause?

06:44.271 --> 06:46.238
What cause?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.523
To cover up this creature
you've created?

06:48.525 --> 06:51.193
Dr. Marks, you obviously got
into this line of work

06:51.195 --> 06:53.278
to put away monsters.

06:53.280 --> 06:57.165
This creature is dangerous.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.368
It needs to be contained.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.624
But the choice is yours.

07:18.422 --> 07:20.422
I'll get it.

07:20.424 --> 07:21.390
What are you wearing?

07:21.392 --> 07:22.641
I thought we said casual.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.276
This is festive-casual.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.894
No, this outfit
is serious pressure.

07:25.896 --> 07:27.646
I don't want him to feel
like this is a big deal.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.531
Well, he should feel
like it's a big deal.

07:29.533 --> 07:30.916
I mean,
he's meeting your sister.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.568
It's festive-casual.

07:33.570 --> 07:35.070
Okay.

07:38.441 --> 07:40.125
Hi. It sounds like
I'm underdressed.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.609
No, no, you're perfect.

07:41.611 --> 07:43.745
It's just the three of us.

07:43.747 --> 07:45.297
It's a safe,
controlled environment.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.748
Hello.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.217
Okay.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.387
Heather, this is Vincent.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.005
Hello.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.424
Hi.

07:55.426 --> 07:56.725
Hi.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.060
He brought flowers.

07:58.062 --> 07:59.394
Oh.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.096
Here.
Thank you.

08:02.298 --> 08:03.849
So, Vincent, I've heard
so much about you.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.068
Oh, yeah, I hope, uh,
not all bad.

08:06.070 --> 08:08.437
Just that he's
a doctor and...

08:08.439 --> 08:10.138
And there's still
so much more I want to know.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.523
Oh, I'm an open book.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.325
Maybe we should
let Vincent eat

08:13.327 --> 08:15.243
before we give him
the third degree.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.445
No, she-she can ask me now.

08:16.447 --> 08:17.779
Oh, really?

08:17.781 --> 08:19.030
So, why'd you run out

08:19.032 --> 08:21.032
when I walked in
on you two the other night?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.869
Uh, because Catherine
was nervous

08:23.871 --> 08:25.787
of me meeting her only sister.

08:25.789 --> 08:27.005
Right.
Yeah.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.373
So, how'd you guys meet?

08:29.175 --> 08:30.292
Well, we were...
I asked him.

08:30.294 --> 08:31.259
Outside a bar.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.212
What bar?
Heather.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.897
And I looked into her eyes...

08:37.049 --> 08:39.433
And you just knew?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.486
Yeah.

08:42.605 --> 08:47.192
So, then, why did you
go back to your ex?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.778
Uh, because
I'm a complete idiot.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.664
Who was...

08:52.666 --> 08:55.484
afraid of the
incredibly intense feelings

08:55.486 --> 08:57.402
he has for your sister.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.690
Yeah.

09:02.692 --> 09:04.292
Okay.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.462
Um, I'm going to go put these
in a really nice vase.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.700
Ooh, I'll get it!

09:12.702 --> 09:14.719
I thought we were
the only ones.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.972
Maybe the delivery guy
forgot something?

09:16.974 --> 09:18.206
Delivery guy
is wearing,

09:18.208 --> 09:20.225
uh, a lot
of cologne.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.594
Hey, you made it.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.895
I hope I'm not too late.

09:23.897 --> 09:24.930
No, no, you're perfect.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.381
Come on in.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.651
So, you guys,
this is Darius.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.353
You know, Joe's brother.

09:31.355 --> 09:33.054
How you doing?
Uh, yeah, great.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.391
Isn't this fun?

09:36.393 --> 09:39.277
Yeah, it's great.

09:51.195 --> 09:53.363
I just mentioned it
to Darius in passing.

09:53.365 --> 09:55.115
I wasn't even sure
if he'd show.

09:55.117 --> 09:56.283
Oh, really?

09:56.285 --> 09:57.483
Festive-casual.

09:57.485 --> 09:59.485
Okay, fine.

09:59.487 --> 10:01.154
You know what?
Whatever.

10:01.156 --> 10:02.422
Unlike you,
I actually want you

10:02.424 --> 10:03.957
to meet the guy
that I like.

10:03.959 --> 10:05.491
And I don't see what
the problem is.

10:05.493 --> 10:07.210
I mean, we have
plenty of food.

10:07.212 --> 10:10.180
No, I promised Vincent it
would just be the three of us.

10:10.182 --> 10:14.500
And he just said that he has
intense feelings for you.

10:14.502 --> 10:18.455
And besides, doesn't it look
like they're getting along?

10:18.457 --> 10:19.723
Wow, so a
club promoter.

10:19.725 --> 10:21.274
Uh, so, uh,
what club?

10:21.276 --> 10:22.309
Wednesday night at Paint,

10:22.311 --> 10:24.060
and Thursday over at Dubstep.

10:24.062 --> 10:25.278
I've heard of them.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.446
Good. That means
I'm doing my job.

10:26.448 --> 10:27.981
You know what?

10:27.983 --> 10:29.816
You should text me
sometime, huh?

10:29.818 --> 10:31.318
Hook you up with VIP.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.620
That sounds cool.
I will check it out.

10:33.622 --> 10:35.622
Cool. Uh, Heather says
you're a doctor.

10:35.624 --> 10:37.207
What hospital do you work at?

10:37.209 --> 10:40.160
Actually, uh, he's
in between right now.

10:40.162 --> 10:41.544
Oh, I thought you just said...

10:41.546 --> 10:43.330
I actually
just got a new job,

10:43.332 --> 10:45.582
and I haven't
told you yet.

10:45.584 --> 10:48.418
Oh, you should've
told me...

10:48.420 --> 10:50.920
Yeah.
...honey.

10:51.889 --> 10:53.473
Dinner?

10:55.876 --> 10:57.594
Mmm. That's good.

10:57.596 --> 11:00.013
Yeah.
One second.

11:03.384 --> 11:06.002
♪

11:10.609 --> 11:13.693
...companies begging me
just to use their brand.

11:13.695 --> 11:15.528
These sponsors,
they give you free swag,

11:15.530 --> 11:17.330
and they act like
you owe them something.

11:17.332 --> 11:18.665
Don't you?

11:18.667 --> 11:19.916
I just...
I mean, nothing's free.

11:19.918 --> 11:22.402
You always have to
give something back.

11:22.404 --> 11:23.753
Cat...
No, that's cool.

11:23.755 --> 11:25.071
My brother's a cop, too.

11:25.956 --> 11:27.957
Vincent, are you okay?

11:27.959 --> 11:29.876
Yeah.
Yeah, he's fine.

11:29.878 --> 11:31.094
You're fine, right?

11:31.096 --> 11:32.679
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

11:32.681 --> 11:35.298
You know what, Vinnie?
You should give me your card.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.484
My line of work,
I could use a doctor on call.

11:37.486 --> 11:39.585
Fight breaks out...
No, actually, I think he's

11:39.587 --> 11:40.970
pretty busy with work.
Mm-hmm.

11:40.972 --> 11:43.390
I mean, I gather.
Oh, yeah.

11:43.392 --> 11:44.891
I only ask because,
you know, you look like

11:44.893 --> 11:45.942
you can take care
of yourself.

11:45.944 --> 11:46.926
That's a pretty serious

11:46.928 --> 11:48.594
cut you got on your face.

11:48.596 --> 11:50.280
Yeah, how did you, um...

11:50.282 --> 11:51.364
It was a fight.
Accident.

11:51.366 --> 11:52.482
It was an accident.
Fight.

11:54.453 --> 11:56.403
- Uh, more wine?
- Oh.

12:00.242 --> 12:02.108
How did you do that?

12:02.110 --> 12:04.294
I am such a klutz.

12:04.296 --> 12:06.162
Uh, Darius,
Heather says

12:06.164 --> 12:07.997
that Dubstep is amazing.

12:07.999 --> 12:10.266
Yeah, we totally have to go.
And I know you two like

12:10.268 --> 12:11.634
to dance, so...

12:11.636 --> 12:12.669
The pictures
from Dad's wedding--

12:12.671 --> 12:13.803
you guys are on the dance floor.

12:13.805 --> 12:15.588
There is a picture of us?

12:15.590 --> 12:17.623
Mm-hmm. Well, Cat's back
is to the camera,

12:17.625 --> 12:19.125
but it's definitely you,
Vincent.

12:19.127 --> 12:20.960
Actually, the proofs
are in my room.

12:22.847 --> 12:24.180
Yeah.

12:24.182 --> 12:25.631
Actually, would you excuse me?

12:25.633 --> 12:28.151
I just got to, uh,
check in at the hospital.

12:28.153 --> 12:29.569
Yeah.

12:29.571 --> 12:31.804
Um, maybe I shouldn't

12:31.806 --> 12:33.639
have mentioned the scar?

12:33.641 --> 12:34.941
No, no. You know, it's just...

12:34.943 --> 12:36.910
meeting family
for the first time,

12:36.912 --> 12:39.245
it's always kind of...

12:53.761 --> 12:54.878
Hey.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.463
I, uh... I was just

12:56.465 --> 12:58.681
gonna grab those photos
for Catherine to look at.

12:58.683 --> 13:01.384
So you were gonna go
into my bedroom?

13:01.386 --> 13:03.887
Y-Yeah, I...

13:03.889 --> 13:05.472
I should've asked first.

13:07.942 --> 13:09.692
You know what?

13:09.694 --> 13:13.813
You might be this sweet talker
and you got me flowers and all,

13:13.815 --> 13:16.549
but I think my first instincts
about you were right.

13:16.551 --> 13:18.861
And I don't trust you.
I...

13:21.532 --> 13:22.999
I'm sorry.

13:23.001 --> 13:25.635
Yeah. Me, too.

13:29.456 --> 13:32.208
Thank you.
You're welcome.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.243
You know what,
I got to take off.

13:34.245 --> 13:35.712
Something at the hospital.

13:35.714 --> 13:38.431
But, uh, nice to meet you
and thank you for dinner.

13:38.433 --> 13:39.749
No, I'll-I'll walk you out.

13:39.751 --> 13:41.751
Here.
Thanks.

13:47.392 --> 13:50.092
I am so sorry.
I know that was awkward.

13:50.094 --> 13:52.578
Yeah. We got to get
that photograph.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.564
Yes, I know. That's the first
I heard about it.

13:54.566 --> 13:55.782
I'll get it. Trust me.

13:55.784 --> 13:57.099
I actually already tried,

13:57.101 --> 13:58.651
but your sister caught
me at her door.

13:58.653 --> 14:00.603
We cannot risk having

14:00.605 --> 14:02.405
any more people
know about me.

14:02.407 --> 14:03.606
Yeah, I didn't know that Darius

14:03.608 --> 14:05.158
was gonna be here, obviously.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.409
Um...

14:06.411 --> 14:08.494
But I think it's okay.

14:08.496 --> 14:10.496
He's Joe's brother.
He's a good guy.

14:10.498 --> 14:11.998
No, he is hiding something.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.217
Well, you're hiding something,

14:14.219 --> 14:16.002
and you're a good guy.

14:18.121 --> 14:19.700
Okay, it didn't go
according to plan.

14:19.725 --> 14:20.390
No.

14:20.391 --> 14:21.841
But I think it was just

14:21.843 --> 14:24.644
a normal, awkward,
family dinner.

14:24.646 --> 14:25.628
I don't know.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.346
Because of this, you can come in

14:27.348 --> 14:28.798
the front door tomorrow.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.517
Mmm, better check that
with your sister first.

14:31.519 --> 14:33.069
Yes, I will talk to her.

14:33.071 --> 14:34.871
She'll be fine.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.472
And then we can

14:36.474 --> 14:40.309
hang out in my room
without whispering.

14:40.311 --> 14:42.411
We're whispering now.

14:42.413 --> 14:44.664
That's because we're not alone.

14:44.666 --> 14:47.083
Is everything okay?

14:47.085 --> 14:49.252
All good!

14:49.254 --> 14:50.787
See? Normal.

14:50.789 --> 14:51.954
Hmm.

14:53.023 --> 14:54.173
Yeah.

14:54.175 --> 14:55.291
Photo.

14:55.293 --> 14:56.292
Yes.

14:56.294 --> 14:57.927
Of course.

14:57.929 --> 15:00.546
Bye.

15:08.088 --> 15:09.388
Hey.

15:09.390 --> 15:11.040
Do you think
we could talk?

15:11.042 --> 15:12.391
I would love that.

15:12.393 --> 15:14.694
Let's go in
the interrogation room.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.480
Or I could buy you a cinnamon
dolce latte across the street.

15:17.482 --> 15:18.898
Actually, um...

15:18.900 --> 15:20.399
Is it a case?

15:20.401 --> 15:22.285
Well, come on.
I'll fill you in.

15:22.287 --> 15:23.903
Okay.

15:25.405 --> 15:26.572
Hey.

15:28.575 --> 15:30.359
What's going on?

15:31.411 --> 15:33.880
We need to talk
about Vincent Zalanski.

15:33.882 --> 15:36.415
Uh, what about him?

15:37.417 --> 15:38.584
He doesn't exist.

15:49.363 --> 15:51.355
A lot of people
aren't on Google.

15:51.777 --> 15:53.126
Yeah, but they're on

15:53.128 --> 15:54.461
the Social Security database,

15:54.463 --> 15:56.413
or NCIC or DMV,

15:56.415 --> 15:58.165
or registered as a doctor.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.884
Maybe he changed his name.

16:00.886 --> 16:02.336
Cat, you're a cop.

16:02.338 --> 16:03.787
Why do people do that?

16:04.839 --> 16:06.456
Because he's hiding
from the law.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.892
He's definitely not
hiding from the law.

16:08.894 --> 16:10.677
Really, Cat?
Because last night I caught him

16:10.679 --> 16:13.397
snooping around my bedroom like
he was about to steal something.

16:13.399 --> 16:14.598
Okay, what is this?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.249
Is this some sort
of intervention?

16:16.251 --> 16:17.601
Good cop, bad cop?

16:17.603 --> 16:18.819
No, try friend and family,

16:18.821 --> 16:20.303
and you're lucky I'm even here.

16:20.305 --> 16:22.072
I've been this close
to writing you off.

16:22.074 --> 16:24.408
Tess, I am sorry

16:24.410 --> 16:26.777
that I haven't been
very open with you,

16:26.779 --> 16:29.446
but that's going to change.

16:29.448 --> 16:32.949
Heather saw Vincent at dinner,

16:32.951 --> 16:35.085
and okay, he was awkward, but...

16:35.087 --> 16:36.953
He was more
than awkward.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.655
He obviously didn't want
to be there,

16:38.657 --> 16:39.989
and you weren't yourself.

16:39.991 --> 16:41.758
You spent the whole night
talking for him.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.093
You weren't even there.

16:43.095 --> 16:46.129
Okay, you know,
it's called, um...

16:46.131 --> 16:49.015
it's called hyper-vigilance,
and it's a red flag.

16:49.017 --> 16:50.684
A "red flag"?
That you're in an emotionally

16:50.686 --> 16:52.386
toxic relationship.

16:52.388 --> 16:54.170
- Okay, I am not.
- And you're covering for him.

16:54.172 --> 16:56.723
I mean, how did he
really get that scar?

16:56.725 --> 17:01.177
It was a fight
after a motorcycle accident.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.281
Trust me, okay?

17:04.282 --> 17:06.233
This... this is
a misunderstanding.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.852
First of all,
we can't trust you anymore.

17:08.854 --> 17:10.353
And second,
there's no misunderstanding

17:10.355 --> 17:12.656
this guy's clearly
had a bad effect on you.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.374
You disappear during work hours,

17:14.376 --> 17:16.542
you lie about who you're with,
not to mention,

17:16.545 --> 17:18.361
I caught you tampering
with evidence.

17:18.363 --> 17:20.213
It's like you're
a completely different person

17:20.214 --> 17:21.998
I am not.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.367
What about you guys?

17:24.368 --> 17:25.801
It's not like either of you

17:25.804 --> 17:27.369
are in the most
functional relationships.

17:27.372 --> 17:29.589
Cat, this is

17:29.591 --> 17:31.224
about our relationship with you.

17:31.226 --> 17:33.226
Okay, what?

17:33.228 --> 17:35.512
You want me to choose?

17:36.280 --> 17:38.381
Between you and him?

17:38.383 --> 17:40.066
You know what?

17:40.068 --> 17:42.269
Yes, or I start reporting
what you've done.

17:42.271 --> 17:44.271
Hey.

17:44.273 --> 17:46.440
What's going on in here?

17:46.442 --> 17:48.241
Girl talk.

17:48.243 --> 17:50.994
That mean you two
are partners again?

17:50.996 --> 17:52.362
Depends on Cat.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.563
We're working it out.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.454
I was just here,

18:00.456 --> 18:03.072
um, getting feedback
for the centerpieces

18:03.074 --> 18:05.375
for your big shindig tonight,
so, um,

18:05.377 --> 18:07.043
I-I'll see you later.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.095
And, uh, I've got to go

18:09.097 --> 18:11.848
and see if something
came in for us.

18:13.851 --> 18:15.852
She doesn't know.

18:15.854 --> 18:17.270
That's not what
your thing

18:17.272 --> 18:19.589
is about with her?

18:19.591 --> 18:21.525
You and me?
No, I would never.

18:24.095 --> 18:26.029
About tonight...

18:26.031 --> 18:28.231
Miranda's coming.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.599
What happened
to the business trip?

18:29.601 --> 18:31.100
I don't know.

18:31.102 --> 18:33.436
I-I guess she's trying.

18:33.438 --> 18:36.272
Oh, okay, so after years
of ignoring you,

18:36.274 --> 18:39.108
she senses you pulling away,
so she shows up?

18:39.110 --> 18:41.661
Tess, I am going
to talk to her

18:41.663 --> 18:43.780
after the party.

18:45.550 --> 18:46.883
I'm ready to leave her.

18:46.885 --> 18:49.419
Don't do it for me.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.088
You should do
what feels right.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.257
My marriage doesn't feel right.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.093
Neither does an award

18:57.095 --> 18:58.962
for leadership or integrity.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.966
You know,
Clinton was one

19:02.968 --> 19:04.300
of my favorite
presidents.

19:04.302 --> 19:06.436
You are so not helping.
Oh, come on.

19:11.141 --> 19:13.994
Tess and Heather gave me
an ultimatum-- you or them.

19:13.996 --> 19:16.446
Catherine, the photograph...
I got it,

19:16.448 --> 19:18.782
and if she notices it's missing,
I'll just tell her

19:18.784 --> 19:20.033
that I wanted it.
Okay, that's great, but...

19:20.035 --> 19:21.284
Not exactly.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.286
Um, you made Heather
so suspicious

19:23.288 --> 19:25.121
that she and Tess ran your name
through Social Security.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.841
So now JT's gonna have to hack
into the database and add it in.

19:27.843 --> 19:29.092
Catherine, your sister,

19:29.094 --> 19:30.877
she posted those photos online,

19:30.879 --> 19:33.680
including the one of me.

19:33.682 --> 19:38.001
Okay, um,
I'll tell her to take it down.

19:38.003 --> 19:39.686
JT's already deleted it,

19:39.688 --> 19:41.888
but if Muirfield are running
facial recognition scans,

19:41.890 --> 19:43.724
they may trace it back
to her computer.

19:43.749 --> 19:44.475
Oh, my God.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.443
If something bad happens to her
because I wanted

19:46.445 --> 19:48.645
some kind of normal...

19:48.647 --> 19:50.313
She just got the proofs, okay?

19:50.315 --> 19:52.532
That means it was only up
for a short window of time.

19:52.534 --> 19:53.984
But if she made a scan,

19:53.986 --> 19:56.453
then there must be
a digital copy somewhere.

19:56.455 --> 19:58.405
Okay, I'll get it, but we have to keep
Okay.

19:58.407 --> 19:59.573
an eye on her just to be safe.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.691
We will.
Okay.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.033
Okay, so let's just

20:10.035 --> 20:11.968
take care of that.
Hey.

20:11.970 --> 20:13.887
Hi.
You got a minute?

20:13.889 --> 20:17.507
Um, uh, yeah, sure.

20:20.311 --> 20:23.096
I saw you posted
those pictures online.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.681
Yeah, people might want copies.

20:24.683 --> 20:25.932
I looked for the flash drive
everywhere.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.150
I couldn't find it.

20:27.152 --> 20:29.486
Because it's in my bag.

20:29.488 --> 20:30.737
Could I get it?

20:30.739 --> 20:31.905
Why?

20:31.907 --> 20:33.823
Okay.

20:33.825 --> 20:36.943
Heather, Vincent, he

20:36.945 --> 20:40.363
he can't have his picture
posted anywhere.

20:40.365 --> 20:43.450
Why? Because he's a criminal?

20:43.452 --> 20:44.734
No, he's not a criminal.

20:44.736 --> 20:46.202
Heather,

20:46.204 --> 20:47.737
okay, I...

20:47.739 --> 20:50.907
I need you to trust me on this,
all right?

20:50.909 --> 20:53.176
Vincent, he's...

20:53.178 --> 20:55.244
he's dealing with
certain things, and...

20:55.246 --> 20:58.515
and I love you, and I can't
have you involved in them.

20:58.517 --> 21:00.750
So I need you to give me
the flash drive

21:00.752 --> 21:04.054
and promise me that you will
never post his picture again.

21:04.056 --> 21:06.640
Oh, my God, you're...
you're picking him over us.

21:06.642 --> 21:10.527
I don't understand
why I have to pick.

21:10.529 --> 21:11.895
Heather, I invited him to dinner

21:11.897 --> 21:13.897
because I thought
you were on my side.

21:13.899 --> 21:15.699
I am.
It doesn't feel like it.

21:15.701 --> 21:17.534
One awkward double date,

21:17.536 --> 21:19.619
and you decide
that he's a criminal.

21:19.621 --> 21:20.820
You show up

21:20.822 --> 21:22.539
at my workplace,

21:22.541 --> 21:24.324
you talk to my coworker,

21:24.326 --> 21:26.943
you interrogate me
in my interrogation room...

21:26.945 --> 21:29.162
Because I can't just stand by
and let you ruin your life.

21:29.164 --> 21:32.382
I am not ruining my life.

21:32.384 --> 21:34.968
I'm the responsible
one, remember?

21:34.970 --> 21:37.387
Whenever you're in trouble,
who do you come running to?

21:37.389 --> 21:40.507
Yeah. That's right.
I talk to you.

21:40.509 --> 21:43.309
Because that's what
normal siblings do,

21:43.311 --> 21:46.262
but you just... you don't know
how to be normal, do you?

21:46.264 --> 21:48.264
God.

21:48.266 --> 21:49.766
Heather!

21:52.770 --> 21:55.355
Heather.

21:59.695 --> 22:01.361
You know what?

22:01.363 --> 22:02.979
You say you don't want
to choose,

22:02.981 --> 22:05.198
but I think
you just did, so here.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.083
You got your photo back,

22:07.085 --> 22:09.652
but Vincent Zalanski
just cost you your roommate.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.088
Heather, wait!

22:13.592 --> 22:16.042
So, how's it feel

22:16.044 --> 22:18.294
to be the finest
of New York's finest?

22:18.296 --> 22:20.013
Um, you got to tell me.

22:20.015 --> 22:22.999
I read all about your club--
top ten New York hot spots.

22:23.001 --> 22:24.834
Yeah, but I'm not
protecting and serving.

22:24.836 --> 22:27.187
Oh, no, no, you're serving,

22:27.189 --> 22:28.688
and you are driving a Porsche.

22:28.690 --> 22:30.339
Meanwhile,
big brother driving a squad car.

22:30.341 --> 22:31.608
So, who's the family jerk now?

22:31.610 --> 22:34.110
You still.
Seriously, though,

22:34.112 --> 22:36.345
I am so damn proud of you.

22:36.347 --> 22:39.032
Thanks, man.

22:39.034 --> 22:40.984
Uh-oh. Here comes
your new girlfriend.

22:40.986 --> 22:43.620
No drama
in my precinct.

22:47.708 --> 22:50.710
Hey. You think it's a bad idea
to drink on the job?

22:50.712 --> 22:52.996
You're asking a guy
who works in a club?

22:52.998 --> 22:55.498
Clearly, I'm looking for a yes.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.003
Hey, you okay?

23:00.005 --> 23:02.705
Uh... no.

23:04.226 --> 23:05.558
You want to get out of here?

23:05.560 --> 23:06.860
Okay.

23:09.346 --> 23:12.315
You ever driven one
of these before?

23:12.317 --> 23:15.018
No. Why?

23:15.020 --> 23:16.736
You want to?

23:16.738 --> 23:18.104
After you.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.722
What?

23:48.438 --> 23:51.139
Hey. Uh, so,

23:51.141 --> 23:52.974
I know Heather
probably told you

23:52.976 --> 23:54.410
that I picked; I didn't pick.

23:54.412 --> 23:56.161
I don't know why I have to.

23:56.163 --> 23:57.780
Wait. You picked?

23:57.782 --> 23:59.948
Heather didn't tell you
about our fight?

23:59.950 --> 24:02.117
I haven't seen Heather.
Oh.

24:02.119 --> 24:03.535
Okay, so here's
what I'm thinking.

24:03.537 --> 24:05.871
You give me a do-over,
we become partners again.

24:05.873 --> 24:07.423
You see that I am fine,

24:07.425 --> 24:08.824
and you tell Heather
that I'm....

24:08.826 --> 24:10.342
I'm not giving you a do-over

24:10.344 --> 24:11.827
with fake-named Vincent
in the picture.

24:11.829 --> 24:14.880
Vincent's not actually
a fake name.

24:14.882 --> 24:17.299
Oh, whatever.

24:20.020 --> 24:23.472
You are so much
prettier than she is.

24:23.474 --> 24:25.607
Still no do-over.

24:27.811 --> 24:30.396
God, where... where is Heather?

24:33.400 --> 24:35.317
I'm checking every security
camera in the precinct.

24:35.319 --> 24:36.702
Tell me I'm being paranoid.

24:36.704 --> 24:38.487
You said you had a fight.

24:38.489 --> 24:40.539
I mean, maybe that's why
she's not answering.

24:40.541 --> 24:42.908
I know, but I'm supposed
to be keeping an eye on her,

24:42.910 --> 24:44.410
and what if...?

24:44.412 --> 24:45.961
What if you're right?

24:45.963 --> 24:49.381
What if Muirfield traced
your picture to her computer?

24:49.383 --> 24:52.835
Maybe <i>I</i> was being paranoid.

24:52.837 --> 24:55.137
Okay. Okay, she's with Darius.

24:55.139 --> 24:57.005
See?

24:57.007 --> 24:58.707
But you said he was a liar.

24:58.709 --> 25:01.176
I thought we were worrying
about Muirfield.

25:01.178 --> 25:03.562
We were.

25:03.564 --> 25:05.247
Ok, hang on.

25:05.249 --> 25:08.067
A black SUV followed them.

25:08.069 --> 25:09.551
Okay, you got plates?

25:09.553 --> 25:11.236
No, I can't make them out.

25:11.238 --> 25:14.656
If-if anything happens to her,
I will never forgive myself.

25:14.658 --> 25:17.076
Okay, we'll find her. We're just
gonna track her phone.

25:17.078 --> 25:22.114
Okay. 212-555-0180.

25:22.116 --> 25:24.666
I need to talk to you
about, uh, that creature.

25:24.668 --> 25:26.201
Okay, I got to call you back.

25:27.737 --> 25:29.121
I have a decision
to make--

25:29.123 --> 25:31.006
an opportunity,
actually--

25:31.008 --> 25:33.074
but it would
come at a cost.

25:33.076 --> 25:36.211
And I'm trying to figure
out if it'd be worth it.

25:36.213 --> 25:37.713
What kind of opportunity?

25:37.715 --> 25:40.132
A way to hunt this thing?

25:40.134 --> 25:42.968
Evan, let this go.

25:42.970 --> 25:45.053
Look, I know that you know
this thing exists.

25:45.055 --> 25:46.789
That bike messenger

25:46.791 --> 25:48.774
that you said
that you killed in self-defense

25:48.776 --> 25:50.976
had cross-species DNA
all over him.

25:50.978 --> 25:52.878
And your car crash.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.731
I saw someone, some thing
pull you out of that wreckage.

25:55.733 --> 25:57.149
Okay, I...

25:57.151 --> 25:59.601
I want to talk about this, I do,

25:59.603 --> 26:01.320
but it's not a good time.

26:01.322 --> 26:03.739
Look, I just...

26:03.741 --> 26:05.290
Look, just tell me why
you won't pursue it.

26:05.292 --> 26:07.326
Because I'm not a scientist.
No.

26:07.328 --> 26:10.111
You're a homicide detective,
and this thing kills people.

26:10.113 --> 26:13.732
Criminals.
It kills criminals.

26:13.734 --> 26:16.051
There you go again,
protecting it.

26:16.053 --> 26:17.836
Evan, I'm sorry.

26:46.584 --> 26:47.950
Heather!

26:47.952 --> 26:51.336
Cat? What are you doing here?
Heather.

26:51.338 --> 26:52.988
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

26:52.990 --> 26:55.123
What?
Your phone-- you weren't answering it.

26:55.125 --> 26:57.543
I'm mad at you, remember?
And I can't hear it.

26:57.545 --> 26:59.127
Okay, where's Darius?

26:59.129 --> 27:00.662
He's at the bar
getting drinks.

27:00.664 --> 27:02.181
Why? What's going on?

27:02.183 --> 27:04.165
Okay, when I... when
I couldn't find you,

27:04.167 --> 27:06.885
I checked security footage.
There were guys following you.

27:06.887 --> 27:10.472
In a black SUV? Yeah,
those are Darius's friends.

27:13.677 --> 27:15.444
Oh, my God.
Why?

27:15.446 --> 27:17.145
What did you think?
No, it doesn't matter.

27:17.147 --> 27:19.481
I...

27:19.483 --> 27:22.534
I love you, and I don't want you
to move out.

27:22.536 --> 27:25.854
Okay, I-I don't, either,
Cat, but...

27:27.040 --> 27:29.458
What about Vincent Zalanski?

27:29.460 --> 27:31.627
I don't feel safe
around him.

27:31.629 --> 27:35.581
All right, maybe I overstepped,
surprising you at work. I...

27:35.583 --> 27:37.716
No, you were worried about me.
I get it.

27:37.718 --> 27:40.135
Just, looking
for you today, I...

27:40.137 --> 27:42.337
I never want
to feel that way again.

27:42.339 --> 27:44.306
I will...

27:44.308 --> 27:45.724
I will break up
with Vincent Zalanski.

27:45.726 --> 27:47.059
We can burn
his photo together.

27:47.061 --> 27:48.543
I'm done.

27:48.545 --> 27:52.314
Good, 'cause
he's kind of sketchy.

27:53.233 --> 27:56.217
And he's here.

27:57.687 --> 28:00.322
What, you can do this.

28:00.324 --> 28:02.190
Okay.
Okay.

28:07.196 --> 28:11.950
Darius, since when do you pay
with your own money, huh?

28:11.952 --> 28:14.169
Let's go somewhere
less crowded.

28:16.572 --> 28:19.124
Let's go. Now.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.215
It wasn't Muirfield.
Yeah, I heard.

28:27.217 --> 28:29.918
I also heard about, uh,
you wanting to burn that photo.

28:29.920 --> 28:33.355
Uh, are we breaking up, or...?

28:33.357 --> 28:35.557
Just for Heather's benefit.

28:35.559 --> 28:38.644
We can't do this
anymore, Vincent!

28:38.646 --> 28:39.861
You're right.

28:39.863 --> 28:41.530
I don't think she heard you.

28:41.532 --> 28:44.116
You're right, Catherine.
We should break up.

28:44.118 --> 28:46.818
I should have just stuck
to the original plan.

28:46.820 --> 28:50.956
Never seen you before,
never see you again.

28:50.958 --> 28:53.441
Catherine, you didn't want
to lose your sister.

28:53.443 --> 28:55.276
So I put her in danger?

28:55.278 --> 28:58.279
It wasn't Muirfield this time,
but she did post that photo.

28:58.281 --> 29:00.882
And I put you
in danger, too.

29:00.884 --> 29:04.219
I can't believe how selfish
I was to even attempt it.

29:04.221 --> 29:06.388
No, you weren't being selfish.
You just...

29:06.390 --> 29:09.174
You wanted this
to be a little more normal.

29:10.677 --> 29:12.794
The reality is,
you can't have that with me.

29:14.647 --> 29:16.965
Wait. Are you being serious?

29:16.967 --> 29:18.650
You know, just before
we pretend break up,

29:18.652 --> 29:21.469
maybe you should consider
whether it should be pretend.

29:40.177 --> 29:42.679
Hey. Hey. Excuse me.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.464
Hey, have you seen Darius?

29:44.466 --> 29:47.250
He's down the hall.
Got it. Thanks.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.641
Darius?

29:59.147 --> 30:01.865
Darius!  Darius.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.483
What are you doing?!
Get out of here!

30:03.485 --> 30:05.152
Leave him alone!

30:08.073 --> 30:09.990
My sister's a cop!

30:09.992 --> 30:11.408
Shut up.
Heather, shh!

30:11.410 --> 30:13.293
Look, if you guys do any...

30:13.295 --> 30:15.879
Hey...

30:15.881 --> 30:18.415
Listen, I said, man, I told
you, I'll pay you back.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.500
I got a big club night
going off tomorrow night.

30:20.502 --> 30:22.419
Okay? VIP, big money.

30:22.421 --> 30:23.670
I'm-I'm good for it.

30:23.672 --> 30:25.922
What about her?
She tells her sister,

30:25.924 --> 30:28.975
the cops start looking at us?

30:28.977 --> 30:31.161
We're not gonna let that happen.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.763
What are you gonna do?

30:32.765 --> 30:35.131
Not us. You.

30:36.634 --> 30:39.636
You brought her in,
she's your problem.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.111
She's gonna talk

30:48.113 --> 30:50.197
about us,
it's all gonna come back to you.

30:50.199 --> 30:53.867
Your hero brother is gonna find
out what a real loser you are.

30:53.869 --> 30:55.919
It's your finger
on the trigger.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.210
I...

31:33.791 --> 31:36.192
Heather? Heather?

31:49.640 --> 31:52.041
Oh, no.

32:13.331 --> 32:16.016
Vincent?

32:16.901 --> 32:19.068
What's wrong?

32:20.738 --> 32:23.190
I killed him.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.407
Who?

32:24.409 --> 32:26.142
Darius.

32:30.265 --> 32:32.349
Oh, my... oh, my God,
is she okay?

32:32.351 --> 32:33.633
Yeah.

32:33.635 --> 32:35.385
There were these guys, and...

32:35.387 --> 32:37.086
they told him
to kill her, and...

32:37.088 --> 32:39.856
he was gonna do it,
he was gonna pull the trigger,

32:39.858 --> 32:41.474
and I... I didn't know

32:41.476 --> 32:44.027
what to do.
I just...

32:44.029 --> 32:45.812
You know I didn't mean to.

32:48.984 --> 32:50.066
Heather?

32:50.068 --> 32:52.402
Are you all right?

32:52.404 --> 32:53.987
I'll be right there, okay?

Have,
those, uh, guys

34:44.420 --> 34:46.338
that pulled you
into the alley,

34:46.340 --> 34:49.139
did you get their names or...?

34:49.976 --> 34:51.376
No. Um...

34:51.378 --> 34:55.730
it all happened so fast.

34:55.732 --> 34:59.084
But it seemed like
Darius knew them.

34:59.086 --> 35:01.319
Were they the "friends"
in the SUV?

35:01.321 --> 35:02.904
I don't know.

35:02.906 --> 35:05.556
And was Darius weird at all?

35:06.909 --> 35:10.095
Um... just scared.

35:10.097 --> 35:13.598
You know, those guys
had a gun to his head.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.284
I just can't believe it.

35:16.286 --> 35:19.904
I was dancing with him
an hour ago,

35:19.906 --> 35:22.040
and now he's...

35:25.261 --> 35:29.798
It just feels like Mom
all over again.

35:31.350 --> 35:34.752
Everything was normal,
and now it's just...

35:37.940 --> 35:39.975
I am so sorry.

35:39.977 --> 35:43.028
I really
liked him, Cat.

35:43.030 --> 35:45.647
I know you did.

35:49.619 --> 35:51.036
Hey.

35:51.038 --> 35:52.454
Hey.

35:52.456 --> 35:54.022
Evan wants to talk to you.

35:54.024 --> 35:56.374
I'll sit with her.

35:57.543 --> 36:00.412
I'm okay.

36:00.414 --> 36:01.663
Okay.

36:01.665 --> 36:02.998
Thank you.

36:07.253 --> 36:08.720
Hey.

36:08.722 --> 36:10.621
How's your sister?

36:10.623 --> 36:11.973
She's gonna be okay.

36:11.975 --> 36:14.726
She was lucky.

36:14.728 --> 36:17.512
This time, the victim
wasn't a criminal, Cat.

36:17.514 --> 36:19.397
Are you sure about that?

36:19.399 --> 36:20.932
Maybe Darius wasn't so innocent.

36:20.934 --> 36:23.818
We knew he had a gun.
His prints were all over it.

36:23.820 --> 36:26.471
Yeah, maybe he was trying
to defend himself against it.

36:26.473 --> 36:27.739
Or protect your sister.

36:27.741 --> 36:30.241
We don't know the whole story.

36:30.243 --> 36:32.527
I think I know one part.

36:32.529 --> 36:34.662
This creature is connected
to you somehow.

36:34.664 --> 36:36.531
That's not...
The bike messenger,

36:36.533 --> 36:39.034
your car crash, me,
your sister,

36:39.036 --> 36:41.853
it's-it's like
it's circling you.

36:41.855 --> 36:43.204
Like a predator does
to its prey.

36:43.206 --> 36:44.956
Prey?

36:44.958 --> 36:46.791
You think that you
understand this thing.

36:46.793 --> 36:48.593
Look.

36:48.595 --> 36:50.929
It is unpredictable.

36:50.931 --> 36:52.547
I am scared for you, Cat.

36:52.549 --> 36:54.665
Trust me, Evan.

36:54.667 --> 36:58.603
You don't have to be.

37:02.358 --> 37:05.843
If you're not
going to protect yourself...

37:05.845 --> 37:07.979
I will.

37:13.936 --> 37:15.853
I knew I'd find
you here.

37:18.491 --> 37:22.093
I brought flowers.

37:22.095 --> 37:25.764
That's how this
whole thing started.

37:25.766 --> 37:28.699
I brought flowers
to that dinner.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.058
Vincent, you saved

37:37.060 --> 37:38.877
Heather's life.

37:38.879 --> 37:41.980
Don't beat yourself up
for taking out her killer.

37:41.982 --> 37:44.365
I killed Joe's brother.

37:46.051 --> 37:48.520
You have a brother taken away
from you like that,

37:48.522 --> 37:50.572
you never stop looking
for justice, ever.

37:50.574 --> 37:52.207
That rage,

37:52.209 --> 37:55.743
it... it makes you do
crazy things.

37:55.745 --> 37:57.278
Like enlist?

37:57.280 --> 38:00.615
Like saying yes
to those experiments.

38:02.535 --> 38:05.253
JT, Joe's the head
of the precinct.

38:05.255 --> 38:07.705
He's gonna use
every resource he's got,

38:07.707 --> 38:10.074
and he won't stop
until he takes me down.

38:10.076 --> 38:12.127
We'll handle it.

38:12.129 --> 38:14.179
Catherine will protect you.

38:14.181 --> 38:17.749
