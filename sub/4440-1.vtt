00:14.530 --> 00:16.149
Nailed it!

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:41.870 --> 00:43.919
So long, girl next door.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.570
Hope they find my body before the
smell becomes a problem for you.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.699
<i>Shit bulls! That's loud!
It's the middle of the bloody night!</i>

01:08.700 --> 01:10.099
Wilfred, that's enough!

01:10.100 --> 01:12.299
<i>You're lucky I'm indoors, you prick!</i>

01:12.300 --> 01:15.020
<i>- Stop it!
- Boyfriend, figures.</i>

01:15.030 --> 01:18.110
<i>Christ! You know that long it
took me to get comfortable?</i>

02:03.620 --> 02:05.170
What?

02:06.210 --> 02:07.660
Hey...

02:08.940 --> 02:12.369
- How you doing?
- I live next door.

02:12.370 --> 02:15.419
- We've waved...
- Course.

02:15.420 --> 02:17.310
- Ryan.
- I'm Jenna.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.079
Can I get you something?
Orange juices...

02:21.080 --> 02:23.049
Medical attention?

02:23.050 --> 02:25.559
I'm okay.
It's a lack of sleep.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.820
Oh God, I know!
It's that stupid jerk with his motorcycle.

02:27.821 --> 02:29.879
He drives Wilfred nuts!

02:29.880 --> 02:33.369
Sorry about all the noise
that he made, by the way.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.640
He just said what we were
all thinking, right?

02:36.650 --> 02:38.340
I guess.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.089
Look, I know we've just met and

02:42.090 --> 02:44.669
this is a huge imposition,
but I'm totally desperate.

02:44.670 --> 02:47.559
The exterminator is on his
way and I completely forgot

02:47.560 --> 02:49.579
to make arrangements for my dog.

02:49.580 --> 02:53.159
They say that if he lives in the
house it's just gonna to kill him.

02:53.160 --> 02:55.699
And so I was wondering if you okay

02:55.700 --> 02:57.910
if he stays in your yard
until I return from work.

02:57.911 --> 02:58.330
Huh?

02:58.460 --> 03:00.639
You're right. That's too much to ask!
I'm sorry.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.240
- No! It's all right...
- Oh great!

03:02.241 --> 03:04.030
Wilfred.
Come here, boy.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.219
He's really sweet.
There is my little man!

03:06.220 --> 03:08.549
- You like dogs?
- Yeah.

03:08.550 --> 03:12.089
Oh great. Well, um...
here is few of his toys and some snacks.

03:12.090 --> 03:14.680
Be a good boy.
I really appreciate this.

03:49.910 --> 03:51.589
Very nice.

03:51.590 --> 03:54.349
Some sofas,
it's impossible to get comfortable.

03:54.350 --> 03:55.990
Not this one.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.359
- Ryan, is it?
- Yeah.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.049
- Got any DVDs?
- Few.

04:01.050 --> 04:04.420
- I like Matt Damon.
- Yeah, he's good.

04:08.260 --> 04:10.990
- It's my sister.
- Just pretend I'm not here.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.259
- Hello, Kristen.
- So, you excited?

04:16.260 --> 04:17.719
I don't know what I am.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.269
Well, it's your first day in the job.

04:19.269 --> 04:22.399
A little anxiety is to be expected.
Thats's why I prescribed those pills.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.209
Yeah. About those...

04:24.210 --> 04:26.559
They don't really seem to...

04:26.560 --> 04:29.290
- You need to go out?
- <i>Who are you talking to?</i>

04:30.190 --> 04:32.519
Oh, it's just...

04:32.520 --> 04:34.479
Look, the thing is...

04:34.480 --> 04:38.479
I really appreciate your help getting
me this job in the hospital but,

04:38.480 --> 04:39.880
I'm not sure working in

04:39.890 --> 04:42.549
contract administration
will make me happy.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.089
<i>Happy?
You won't be happy, Ryan?</i>

04:45.090 --> 04:48.579
- You think Dad is happy?
- No. I know I screwed up.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.689
- You think I'm happy?
- No, I would never...

04:50.690 --> 04:53.010
You think I love pulliing out babies 24/7?

04:53.020 --> 04:54.820
I mean, my god, I have
to eat with these hands!

04:54.821 --> 04:56.090
- Need some water.
- Uh?

04:56.640 --> 04:57.500
Water.

04:58.230 --> 05:00.549
<i>You think he is happy?
No, Ryan!</i>

05:00.550 --> 05:02.769
Nobody is happy!
All right?

05:02.770 --> 05:05.069
And listen, you're not exactly
a hot commodity anymore.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.990
<i>- You need this job.
- Uh, okay.</i>

05:06.991 --> 05:08.779
Thanks for the pep talk.

05:08.780 --> 05:12.229
<i>You're welcome. Now, remember:
It's all about perception.</i>

05:12.230 --> 05:14.310
Just got to change the way
you're seeing things.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.620
<i>- All right?
- I work on that.</i>

05:22.300 --> 05:24.610
Have a seat.
I ain't gonna bite you.

05:26.310 --> 05:28.100
Bite it's the easy way I have.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.470
Not that I think about it.

05:33.870 --> 05:35.559
Uh, bit jumpy, are we?

05:35.560 --> 05:37.969
No, I'm cool.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.420
I'm seven years old, Ryan.

05:39.421 --> 05:41.999
Too old and too wise for lies.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.349
I can smell your fear,

05:44.350 --> 05:46.300
like l smell the sour milk in the fridge.

05:47.340 --> 05:49.480
I've drunk some last night. It was fine.

05:53.790 --> 05:55.360
It was.

05:56.370 --> 05:59.620
It is gone bad.
Just happened, when we were talking.

06:01.070 --> 06:03.690
No... I'm starting the new job today.

06:04.510 --> 06:06.990
Ryan...
You're not going to work to die.

06:19.530 --> 06:21.509
Got to cough to get off.

06:21.510 --> 06:23.470
It's been a while.

06:24.130 --> 06:26.619
Can you really smell the
milk in my fridge?

06:26.620 --> 06:31.069
My nose is a very exquisite
and sensitive organ.

06:31.070 --> 06:34.339
And right now, it is
currently smelling fear.

06:34.340 --> 06:38.759
Fear, some milk and human shit.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.220
You mean me?
I just showered.

06:41.230 --> 06:43.029
I'm crazy clean about there.

06:43.030 --> 06:45.170
There are such things in
this world, as particles.

06:45.171 --> 06:50.019
Particles so small that you cannot
possibly detect with your naked eye.

06:50.020 --> 06:53.770
And I put it to you that they
are particles of human shit

06:53.780 --> 06:55.859
lingering in the **** of your underpants.

06:55.860 --> 06:59.430
- I don't think there's any particles.
- Man, I'm telling you, there are particles.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.950
And they are lingering.

07:06.090 --> 07:07.700
I need to sleep.

07:11.850 --> 07:13.970
Lights out, Ryan.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.489
Shit!

07:26.490 --> 07:29.099
- Kristen...
- <i>You are so dead!</i>

07:29.100 --> 07:32.459
I vouched for you, and now you're no show
on your first day of work?

07:32.460 --> 07:35.389
- Dr. Ramos is furious!
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

07:35.390 --> 07:37.959
- I've had a rough morning.
- <i>You had a rough morning?</i>

07:37.960 --> 07:41.129
Try plying (pulling??) twin boys out of a
tight little Asian gal.

07:41.130 --> 07:42.989
She wasn't an Asian-American, Ryan.

07:42.990 --> 07:44.530
She was real Asian!

07:44.540 --> 07:48.259
I had to do so much splice and dicing down there that it looked like a god dammed Benihana's

07:48.260 --> 07:51.170
So why don't you get your
shit together, and come to work.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.100
Nice nap, Ryan?

08:08.900 --> 08:11.330
Scared you?
Give you quite a fright, did I?

08:12.230 --> 08:14.110
Am I dead?

08:15.400 --> 08:16.889
Seems no.

08:16.890 --> 08:18.390
Come on.
I want to show you something.

08:20.340 --> 08:22.709
What did you..?
Why?!

08:22.710 --> 08:26.079
Anxiety.
Jenna has been away too long.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.320
She's a goner.
I'm sure of it.

08:28.330 --> 08:31.509
She probably choked on something.
Little piece of Lego or something.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.049
She's just at work.

08:33.049 --> 08:35.469
Are you talking down to me?

08:35.470 --> 08:37.419
What? No!

08:37.429 --> 08:40.119
I open up to you, and you talk down to me.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.568
Look, she's coming back.

08:41.570 --> 08:43.299
- Promise?
- Sure.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.859
Thank you, Ryan.
I feel much better, now.

08:48.860 --> 08:51.199
Why are you still digging?

08:51.200 --> 08:54.369
- It's a great workout.
- Stop!

08:54.370 --> 08:57.170
Ryan, I know your type.

08:57.180 --> 08:59.999
You're a good boy.
You come when you're called.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.249
You don't rub your ass on a carpet.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.680
Aren't you tired of doing what
everyone else want you to do?

09:06.560 --> 09:09.790
Maybe it's time you quit
playing ball with them...

09:10.800 --> 09:13.000
And just play ball with me.

09:14.200 --> 09:18.259
- Where that come from?
- Just give it a toss.

09:18.260 --> 09:19.669
I don't think I should.

09:19.670 --> 09:22.049
- Trust me, you be glad you did...
- No.

09:22.050 --> 09:24.020
- I still go to work.
- I still go for a walk.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.549
I don't have time for a walk.

09:25.550 --> 09:28.219
Ryan, you're already upset
about the hole, yeah?

09:28.220 --> 09:31.200
Well, I've got just enough piss
on me to kill what's left of it.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.489
Tell me about Jenna.

09:36.490 --> 09:39.389
- Why?
- How am I to get to know her?

09:39.390 --> 09:41.789
Put your lipstick back in this case, Romeo.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.039
- You're not her type.
- How can you say that?

09:44.040 --> 09:45.520
You don't know anything about me.

09:45.521 --> 09:47.980
I know you think there's no hope.

09:49.530 --> 09:52.419
I know you feel like a
diamond in the rough...

09:52.420 --> 09:53.990
that's never going to shine.

09:55.110 --> 09:57.989
I know what you tried to do last night.

09:57.990 --> 10:01.329
- How do you...
- Because I am you.

10:01.330 --> 10:03.470
We are one mind.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.160
Ah, just messing with you

10:07.161 --> 10:10.230
I read the snuff letter
when you were passed out.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.350
What did she think of it?

10:16.351 --> 10:19.479
Well, "The Diamond in the rough"
metaphor was a little flat.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.259
Four drafts and that's the best you can come up with?

10:22.260 --> 10:24.969
I started with "a caged bird longing to be free",

10:24.970 --> 10:27.659
but that maybe sound a little ****.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.239
So does using the word "****".

10:30.240 --> 10:33.469
Maybe I'll keep working on it.

10:33.470 --> 10:35.499
<i>- You know Buck?
- Who?</i>

10:35.500 --> 10:36.899
Buck.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.829
Black lab, like my age, great teeth.
You know him?

10:39.830 --> 10:41.720
- I don't know Buck.
- And you won't.

10:41.721 --> 10:43.740
Because he is gone.

10:43.750 --> 10:47.829
One day, running around by
the tennis court to the park.

10:47.830 --> 10:51.190
- The next time...
- Hit by a car?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.579
No, we just kind of lost touch.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.379
You just kind of lost touch?

10:56.380 --> 10:58.739
Life is short, Ryan.

10:58.740 --> 11:01.879
****.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.079
Speaking of rosebuds...

11:04.080 --> 11:07.009
Do you always feed your dog with nachos?

11:07.010 --> 11:10.150
Not all the time,
but he worked out today.

11:12.390 --> 11:14.059
What's your name?

11:14.060 --> 11:15.529
- Wilfred.
- Wilfred.

11:15.530 --> 11:17.530
Hi, Wilfred.

11:17.540 --> 11:22.070
Do you like that? Do you like that?
You bet you do!

11:22.810 --> 11:26.310
- I'll have what he's having.
- He likes me.

11:28.460 --> 11:31.229
Wilfred. Get off.

11:31.230 --> 11:33.179
- Get off!
- I'm trying to!

11:33.180 --> 11:35.000
He just really likes me.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.949
Sorry about that.

11:38.950 --> 11:42.189
- Can we get the check?
- Yeah.

11:42.190 --> 11:43.950
There you go.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.500
Bye, Wilfred.

11:48.850 --> 11:50.279
I like you,

11:50.280 --> 11:52.499
but you are a shit wingman.

11:52.500 --> 11:56.499
- Look, Ryan, if you want my advice...
- Actually, I don't.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.199
I've got enough people
telling me what to do.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.529
I'm just trying to help.
You don't have to be a dick.

12:02.530 --> 12:04.959
Kristen was right.
What I want doesn't matter.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.449
I have to get to work.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.980
- Hey, poochy pooch...
- Piss off!

12:10.700 --> 12:14.599
See, it's like me when I'm
eating the ass of a dead possum.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.839
While I'm eating at his guts through his ass, and I'm getting my teeth right in there.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.879
No one ever told me that.
I just did it one day. It happened.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.159
- And do it ever since.
- Interesting. Have you tried Korean?

12:26.160 --> 12:28.600
- I think you'd like it.
- You're missing the point.

12:28.610 --> 12:30.809
I'm not just saying
possum ass is delicious.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.279
It is.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.119
What I'm saying is
I'm true to my nature.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.829
And I don't overthink everything.
I act on instinct.

12:36.830 --> 12:40.250
- You're an animal.
- We're all animals, Ryan.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.819
I'll kill you!

12:42.820 --> 12:46.300
Wilfred, wait.
Stay! Come!

12:48.320 --> 12:51.459
Where is his leash?
He's lucky I didn't kick his teeth in!

12:51.460 --> 12:54.409
- * Loser! Fuck!
- No! I mean it!

12:54.410 --> 12:56.029
It won't happen again.

12:56.030 --> 12:58.999
Yeah it does,
or someone's getting nuts cut off.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.920
Okay.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.429
He means me.
You obviously haven't got anything.

13:06.430 --> 13:09.039
Yeah, you're right. I should have
challenged him into a knives fight.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.499
You let that shit stain walk all over us.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.460
Your father was right.
You're a pussy.

13:14.330 --> 13:15.730
Why did you say that?

13:16.430 --> 13:18.899
All right, he didn't, I made that up,
but you are a pussy.

13:18.900 --> 13:22.529
- I will not listen to this.
- Ryan, fear has made you weak.

13:22.530 --> 13:25.719
Fear is the mind killer.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.469
Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.

13:29.470 --> 13:31.549
That's from "Dune".
How do you know that?

13:31.550 --> 13:33.369
How do you know that?

13:33.370 --> 13:37.229
Come on, man.
Throw the ball.

13:37.230 --> 13:39.719
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.599
- But I know that's not just a ball.
- Of course it is.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.910
- See? It's a ball.
- Why are you pushing so hard?

13:44.911 --> 13:47.350
I'm feeling playful.
No more questions.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.639
Stop thinking
and throw the damn ball!

13:49.640 --> 13:51.040
No!

13:56.730 --> 13:59.749
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that...

13:59.750 --> 14:01.900
- You're a naughty boy!
- I'll give you another ball.

14:01.901 --> 14:03.510
- I don't want another ball.
- Hey!

14:03.511 --> 14:05.789
Hey! Look Wilfred, it's Jenna.

14:05.790 --> 14:07.789
Hey, I hope he wasn't in any trouble.

14:07.790 --> 14:09.900
Not at all. He is adorable.

14:09.910 --> 14:13.680
- Wilfred, did you make a new firend?
- He did, he really did.

14:13.690 --> 14:15.969
I will not be ignored, Ryan.

14:15.970 --> 14:18.639
So, Wilfred tells me, hum...

14:18.640 --> 14:20.239
I mean, what brings you to L.A.?

14:20.240 --> 14:23.279
I got a job as assignment(?) producer for Channel 13 News.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.349
It's a big step up for me work wise.

14:25.350 --> 14:28.710
Although I'm doing **** pieces right now, but that will change.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.200
- What about you? What do you do?
- Ball, ball, ball.

14:31.201 --> 14:33.609
I play ball.

14:33.610 --> 14:36.339
Not professionally.
I'm a lawyer.

14:36.340 --> 14:39.809
I was a lawyer. It's complicated.

14:39.810 --> 14:41.300
I like "complicated".

14:42.390 --> 14:45.399
You know, the only thing that I had
time to unpacked were my wine glasses.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.200
You want to come inside?

14:50.330 --> 14:51.730
Some other time.

14:53.090 --> 14:56.090
Okay.
Say bye bye Wilfred.

14:56.870 --> 14:59.039
This isn't over.
I want that ball.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.750
See you later, champ.

15:01.420 --> 15:03.090
Better sleep with your eyes open.

15:04.030 --> 15:05.430
Give Ryan a kiss.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.669
You broke my heart, Ryan.

15:11.670 --> 15:15.209
- You broke my heart!
- Okay!

15:15.210 --> 15:18.729
Wilfred, down.

15:18.730 --> 15:20.130
Down, Wilfred!

15:28.950 --> 15:31.149
<i>You broke my heart, Ryan.</i>

15:31.150 --> 15:32.939
<i>Better sleep with your eyes open.</i>

15:32.940 --> 15:34.919
<i>Hello?</i>

15:34.920 --> 15:36.320
Are you gonna answer me?

15:37.500 --> 15:38.900
What was the question?

15:40.420 --> 15:42.569
- Why do I bother? That's the question.
- Wait.

15:42.570 --> 15:44.790
- I'm having a problem.
- Really?

15:44.800 --> 15:48.389
Those pills you gave, I kind of...
abuse them.

15:48.390 --> 15:50.659
I've taken so many,
I can't feel them anymore.

15:50.660 --> 15:53.929
Ryan, you have any idea
how dangerous that is?

15:53.930 --> 15:56.849
Abusing those pills can lead to
very serious side effects.

15:56.850 --> 15:59.639
Paranoia, hallucinations, depression...

15:59.640 --> 16:01.779
- Hallucinations?
- And worse, much worse.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.179
Oh, my God.

16:03.180 --> 16:05.209
That's why I gave you sugar pills.

16:05.210 --> 16:06.669
What?

16:06.670 --> 16:09.579
Ryan, I can't prescribe meds to a family member.
That's unethical.

16:09.580 --> 16:12.530
So...
No side effects?

16:12.540 --> 16:14.329
From sugar pills?

16:14.330 --> 16:19.119
Adult onset diabetes? Tooth decay?
Sugar rush?

16:19.120 --> 16:22.089
Ryan, why have you been
so self-destructive?

16:22.090 --> 16:25.459
You need to pull yourself
together and stop wallowing in self-pity.

16:25.460 --> 16:28.359
<i>Get back on that horse! ****!</i>

16:28.360 --> 16:30.759
<i>Okay, so your whole
career is over...</i>

16:30.760 --> 16:32.599
Dad wanted me to be a lawyer.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.119
- I hate every minute of it.
- Then, what do you want?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.800
Give me a minute...

16:41.350 --> 16:44.519
- What do you want?
- I want my God damn ball.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.499
Really? This all about?

16:46.500 --> 16:47.939
Ryan...

16:47.940 --> 16:49.340
When I was a young man,

16:49.350 --> 16:52.199
I had a bit of an oral fixation.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.529
Still do, I guess.

16:54.530 --> 16:57.009
Anyway, I was too dumb
to know the difference

16:57.010 --> 17:01.409
between a knot of rawhide and a fine Italian loafer.

17:01.410 --> 17:03.330
Someone would adopt me,

17:03.340 --> 17:07.439
I'd have a bit of a chew, and then it was "back to the pound" we go.

17:07.440 --> 17:11.949
Italian loafer guy gave me a good beating.

17:11.950 --> 17:14.829
Kicked me so hard I got hip displersia.

17:14.829 --> 17:17.138
Displasia.

17:17.140 --> 17:20.509
No I didn't get that bad, but I was on death row.

17:20.510 --> 17:22.089
And then one day,

17:22.089 --> 17:27.459
A kindly old woman at the shelter
gave me a tennis ball.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.689
That tennis ball.

17:29.690 --> 17:32.019
<i>I could chew, without shame,</i>

17:32.020 --> 17:35.379
and suddenly, I was lovable.

17:35.380 --> 17:40.379
<i>That ball saved my life.
I need her back.</i>

17:40.380 --> 17:43.289
And I can't get through
that guy without you.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.270
- So climb over the fence.
- With what arms?

17:45.271 --> 17:47.700
- What are those?
- Legs.

17:50.250 --> 17:54.399
All right, I'll help you.
And then you stay away from me.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.590
- That's what you want...
- Shake on it.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.810
Yeah, I never learned that trick. But you have my word.

18:02.510 --> 18:04.310
I found it!

18:05.180 --> 18:06.730
What are you doing?

18:07.650 --> 18:09.600
The nose knows.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.339
Hey, this was not our deal.

18:13.340 --> 18:16.879
Well, I didn't shake on it, did I?

18:16.880 --> 18:18.410
Here we go.

18:23.390 --> 18:25.679
We're gonna need a bigger bong.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.600
This was your plan the whole time.

18:29.190 --> 18:31.589
Part of it.

18:31.590 --> 18:33.800
This is the other part...

18:37.580 --> 18:39.799
In his boot?

18:39.800 --> 18:42.199
Well, they never check them first,
do they?

18:42.200 --> 18:44.899
What the hell. He deserves it.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.809
- Well, come on, let's go.
- Not so fast...

18:47.810 --> 18:49.959
He has another boot.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.899
You want me to...?
No way.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.880
Why not? He'll never know that was you.

18:53.881 --> 18:56.579
<i>- That's not the point.
- You said yourself he deserves this.</i>

18:56.580 --> 18:59.619
The bloody bike, the trash in the alley,

18:59.620 --> 19:03.539
do why he treat you like some
insignificant limp dick wanker.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.979
- How does that make you feel?
- Angry!

19:05.980 --> 19:09.119
Well, it's time to return the favor.
You know you want too.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.119
- I'm not an animal.
- Then be a man!

19:11.120 --> 19:15.220
For once in your life, be a
man and shit in that boot!

19:17.100 --> 19:19.539
- It was so awesome!
- Well done, Ryan.

19:19.540 --> 19:23.439
Primo coiler, one of the best I've seen.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.040
Shit!

19:39.990 --> 19:41.449
<i>What the hell?</i>

19:41.450 --> 19:44.259
<i>No! No! No! No! No! No! No!</i>

19:44.260 --> 19:45.659
Hey, Ryan...

19:45.660 --> 19:48.309
When was the last time you felt this good?

19:48.310 --> 19:51.819
- Never.
- It's call living, mate.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.519
You can feel this way forever.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.239
Trust our instincts.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.209
No more doubt. No fear.

19:58.210 --> 20:00.620
Just throw it away.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.609
Good boy!

20:14.610 --> 20:17.380
Welcome to your new life.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.009
Aren't you going to fetch it?

20:21.010 --> 20:23.520
Do you know how many balls I have?

20:25.540 --> 20:27.539
What the hell are you doing out here?

20:27.540 --> 20:30.230
- This is my friend Wilfred.
- He looks filthy.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.429
I have Dr. Ramos on the phone.
He is willing to talk to you.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.719
Pick.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.519
Hey, Doc. It's Ryan.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.039
Look, I appreciate the offer but,

20:41.040 --> 20:44.009
I'd rather eat possum ass
than be your desk monkey.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.239
Give me the phone
Dr. Ramos?

20:46.240 --> 20:48.150
Hello?

20:50.830 --> 20:52.619
This is just great.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.739
Do you have any idea how
though the job market is?

20:55.740 --> 20:58.809
Let's just say beggars can't be choosers!

20:58.810 --> 21:00.229
What a bitch!

21:00.230 --> 21:02.799
- What am I supposed to think?
- Whatever you want.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.219
But from now on,
keep it to yourself.

21:05.220 --> 21:09.500
- I don't give a shit.
- Well, actually he do, or he did.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.269
This is funny?
This is all funny to you, Ryan?

21:15.270 --> 21:18.829
You know what? I'm done.
You are on your own.

21:18.830 --> 21:20.899
Wrong.
I'm not on my own

21:20.900 --> 21:22.790
I've got Wilfred!

21:24.260 --> 21:27.179
- What's that?
- It is squirrel.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.579
Gross!

21:28.580 --> 21:30.159
Wilfred...

21:30.160 --> 21:33.209
- How is gonna end?
- Hum?

21:33.210 --> 21:38.570
This. Us.
What's gonna happen?

21:38.580 --> 21:40.680
Don't know.

21:42.090 --> 21:43.739
Anyway...

21:43.740 --> 21:46.820
It's nice to have someone
looking out for me.

22:19.490 --> 22:21.880
Oh, you like that?

22:31.290 --> 22:33.290
Wilfred!

22:38.760 --> 22:40.909
Did you...

22:40.910 --> 22:42.899
Ryan!

22:42.900 --> 22:44.570
Oh God!

22:46.120 --> 22:47.540
Shut up.

22:47.550 --> 22:50.000
Hang on, hang on... hang on.
