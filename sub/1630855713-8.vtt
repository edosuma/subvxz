[song stops]

00:55.263 --> 00:56.639
-Hey.
-Hey, there. [exhales]

00:56.723 --> 00:58.808
I thought I'd make it back
before you were awake.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.519
[hesitatingly] Is this
what you do when I'm not here?

01:01.603 --> 01:02.562
'Cause I like it.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.440
I believe that that is between me
and the woodland creatures outside.

01:05.523 --> 01:09.694
Right. Well, on behalf of myself
and all of the assorted wildlife…

01:09.778 --> 01:11.654
-[Mel laughs]
-…we're definite fans.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.614
Aw, thank you.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.449
-From the squirrels.
-[chuckles]

01:14.532 --> 01:16.117
-That's from me.
-Thank you.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.953
Seriously, though,
I'm glad you're feeling better.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.455
Me too.

01:22.123 --> 01:25.085
And this is, uh, quite the spread
you got going here.

01:25.168 --> 01:30.048
Oh yeah. Well, there was more food.
A lot more, but I ate it. [exhales]

01:31.299 --> 01:33.301
So that's all for you. Help yourself.

01:33.384 --> 01:34.385
Um, I gotta go.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.806
-I'm meeting Doc to go fishing.
-You're what now?

01:38.389 --> 01:39.641
[clears throat] Fishing.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.184
-Fishing?
-[Mel laughs] What?

01:41.267 --> 01:45.438
When I left the clinic,
I offered and Doc took me up on it.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.149
So then after I wash the smell of fish
off of my body,

01:48.233 --> 01:51.027
I'm going for a late lunch
with the sewing circle ladies,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.404
and then, uh, girl's night with Brie.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.199
-I love how everyone's showing up for you.
-Yeah.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.243
Guess I'm just gonna
have to share my star.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.203
Aw! Well, don't you have a busy day?

02:00.286 --> 02:03.206
I do. It's a load-in day, but, I mean,
I'm not gonna be that busy.

02:03.289 --> 02:06.501
I can still make that follow-up
appointment with Dr. Lorton's office.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.169
See when we can start trying again.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.754
[sighing] Oh, right.

02:09.838 --> 02:10.672
Um…

02:11.798 --> 02:14.676
-Uh, maybe we can talk about that later.
-Sure.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.970
Thank you for the flowers and the latte.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.596
-You're welcome.
-I love you.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.265
Love you too.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.433
Good luck fishing.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.227
Thanks.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.857
[door closes]

02:28.940 --> 02:30.942
[theme music playing]

02:42.245 --> 02:43.746
[Brady sighs heavily]

02:44.998 --> 02:47.333
[seagulls cawing]

02:57.218 --> 03:00.138
-We need to talk about the other day.
-That's a good idea.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.598
I swear,

03:02.599 --> 03:04.642
Sacramento was a complete coincidence.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.770
I had no idea Brie was gonna be there.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.273
We ran into each other at the courthouse.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.859
I was just trying to be supportive.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.153
Then why didn't you tell me about it, huh?

03:15.236 --> 03:19.199
I knew if I told you,
you'd probably overreact.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.241
Which you did.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.537
If you really want a shot
at getting her back,

03:24.621 --> 03:26.372
we have to take Melissa down.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.211
You got a wire for me or what?

03:31.294 --> 03:32.128
Yeah.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.343
You're gonna wear it today, all day.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.929
In a perfect world,
you get Melissa admitting

03:41.012 --> 03:44.015
that she's laundering drug money
through the glamping site,

03:44.098 --> 03:47.977
plus any details about
drug locations, shipments.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.189
You expect her to say all this
with Jack on site?

03:51.272 --> 03:54.067
-Get her alone, get her talking.
-[Brady] All right.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.820
But I'm telling you,
if she doesn't admit it soon,

03:58.780 --> 04:01.199
I ain't gonna keep lying to Jack and Brie.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.244
Then stay focused on our goal.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.627
[Lizzie] Morning.

04:13.211 --> 04:17.006
You're here early.
Looking rather spiffy, I might add.

04:17.090 --> 04:17.966
Boss tweed.

04:18.049 --> 04:19.550
I'm chief of staff to the mayor.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.594
I wanted to make
a good impression on my first day.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.054
Consider me impressed.

04:23.137 --> 04:26.266
Well, don't get used to it.
This is just a first-day thing.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.850
I only have one outfit like this.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.769
Clothes don't make the woman.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.981
Now… I made a list
of priorities for the day.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.442
Ugh.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.028
This is as long as the Bible.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.655
New Testament, but still.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.282
There's a lot to tackle!

04:42.365 --> 04:45.827
But lucky for you, your chief of staff
is caffeinated and ready to work.

04:45.910 --> 04:49.080
I think the first order of business
is figuring out a solution

04:49.163 --> 04:51.791
for the displaced people
staying at the school gym.

04:51.874 --> 04:55.003
It could be months before
they're able to find permanent housing.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.797
First order of business
is changing out of your PJ's.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.967
Solving the housing crisis
can be second on today's agenda.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.845
-[Hope] A fine idea. Morning, Denny.
-Morning, Hope.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.179
[Hope] What are you up to today?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.557
I got a job interview at Bert's auto shop.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.975
-Good luck!
-Thanks.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.769
Good morning.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.355
[Lizzie] I'll walk you out
while Hope gets changed.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.822
What?

05:22.905 --> 05:24.073
[Denny] What can I say?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.617
My powerful politician girlfriend
is very sexy.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.619
"Powerful politician"?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.330
Please. Let's not go crazy.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.124
What, are you kidding?
Chief of staff to the mayor is epic.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.625
This promotion's a big deal.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.212
[chuckles]

05:38.296 --> 05:40.465
[chuckles] I had Connie make it
for me last night.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.634
Oh, this is… this is really sweet.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.346
But Hope and I don't need to campaign.

05:46.429 --> 05:51.392
Yet. When you do, now you have some swag
and a boyfriend ready to canvass for you.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.061
I appreciate the support.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.187
Of course.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.814
So Bert's shop. That could be interesting.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.776
Oh, it's super random,
but he's the only one who called me in.

05:59.859 --> 06:03.279
And it'll be good to learn
how to fix a car or change a tire,

06:03.363 --> 06:07.158
or learn the different types of wrenches.
I just looked it up and there are 40.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.827
That is good to know. [chuckles softly]

06:10.495 --> 06:11.996
Well, good luck with your interview.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.624
Thanks.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.461
"Hope and Liz mean biz."

06:19.212 --> 06:21.172
-[Lizzie laughs]
-[Denny] See you later!

06:21.255 --> 06:23.257
[uplifting music playing]

06:25.134 --> 06:29.847
[Mel sighs] I gotta say, this is way more
relaxing than I was expecting.

06:29.931 --> 06:33.017
[Doc] Well, catching fish
is nice, but, uh… [inhales deeply]

06:33.101 --> 06:36.187
I like it out here 'cause
this is where I do my best thinking.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.731
And sometimes I even talk to the fish.

06:38.815 --> 06:39.690
Really?

06:40.733 --> 06:43.027
-They talking back to you?
-[both chuckling]

06:43.111 --> 06:44.779
-They're good listeners.
-[laughs]

06:44.862 --> 06:45.822
No pressure.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.116
No expectations on this boat.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.701
[inhales deeply]

06:50.785 --> 06:53.704
Well, I have been avoiding
the quiet today.

06:54.664 --> 06:58.751
Just listening to music
and trying to drown out my…

06:59.419 --> 07:00.336
my thoughts.

07:00.962 --> 07:01.838
Yeah.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.675
They always come creeping back,
though, don't they?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.386
-Yeah.
-Be gentle with yourself.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.849
You're processing a lot
emotionally and physically, and…

07:14.308 --> 07:16.519
Just takes time to heal a broken heart.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.730
You know, I used to
tell mothers that all the time, and it's…

07:20.690 --> 07:22.733
it's really different
when you're the patient.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.236
-I can relate to that.
-[Mel] Mmm.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.488
I'm in the same boat.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.116
[laughs]

07:30.199 --> 07:31.742
-I see what you did there.
-Uh-huh.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.327
[both laughing]

07:34.245 --> 07:36.289
Yeah, but in our line of work… [sighs]

07:36.372 --> 07:39.208
…sometimes it's hard
to practice what you preach.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.879
How have things been going
with Cameron at the clinic?

07:43.421 --> 07:46.716
I'm offering him
a partnership in the practice.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.052
Doc, that must've been a…
a really hard decision.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.139
Yeah. Well,
I'm not leaving right away, you know.

07:53.222 --> 07:57.018
And with my eyesight, I…
I need him to play a bigger role.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.854
I sure would love
having you there during this.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.983
Work has… has always been healing for me.

08:04.859 --> 08:05.985
I would love to.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.445
Well, that was easy.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.781
Yeah, well, leaving the clinic wasn't.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.743
You know, I think Hope was right.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.330
Nursing has never just been a job to me.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.706
It is a calling.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.920
-So when do you want me to start?
-Whenever you're ready.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.004
Okay.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.759
-Oh, wait, is it-- Did I?
-[line tugging]

08:29.842 --> 08:31.511
-Did I just get--
-[Doc] Pull up. Pull up.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.179
-[Mel] Oh, okay.
-[Doc] Yup. Good. Good.

08:33.262 --> 08:35.348
I think maybe
you just caught the first fish.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.934
-[Mel squeals] Did I catch a fish?
-[both laughing]

08:38.017 --> 08:40.645
[uplifting music playing]

08:41.896 --> 08:43.189
[Brady exhales]

08:52.114 --> 08:53.908
[Hazel faintly] I can't find my boots.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.493
[Hazel muttering]

08:55.576 --> 08:58.329
[Lark] Hazel, we don't have time.
We gotta go. Listen--

08:58.412 --> 09:01.666
-[Hazel] But my boots!
-[Lark speaking indistinctly]

09:03.417 --> 09:05.253
-[Lark] Fine, I'll look in my bags.
-Lark?

09:07.463 --> 09:09.215
Oh my God. Brady.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.926
-Hi.
-Hey.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.511
[scoffs]

09:14.971 --> 09:17.807
-What are you doing here?
-I didn't know anyone was…

09:17.890 --> 09:20.476
[sputtering] I'm sorry.
This is so embarrassing.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.605
[inhales deeply] We're leaving.
Um, just please forget we were even here.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.024
-Hi, Brady!
-[Brady] Hey, kid.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.485
-[Lark] Hazel, can you pack up your toys?
-[Hazel] Okay.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.446
-[Brady] Hey.
-[Lark sighs]

09:32.530 --> 09:33.948
Uh, what's…

09:34.031 --> 09:35.074
What's going on?

09:35.157 --> 09:38.119
We were staying at the elementary school
with the other evacuees,

09:38.202 --> 09:42.248
but Hazel couldn't fall asleep
and she was starting to lose it.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.959
I was passing by.
I noticed all the empty trailers.

09:45.042 --> 09:48.087
I figured we'd crash for a night,
leave super early,

09:48.170 --> 09:50.089
but I slept through my alarm.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.927
-Please don't call the cops. I'm sorry.
-[Brady] It's okay.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.014
Seriously.
You were, uh, just being a good mom.

09:58.097 --> 09:58.931
[vehicle approaching]

09:59.015 --> 10:02.101
I'd let you stay longer.
It's just not my call to make.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.771
Besides, you don't wanna stay here.
It's about to get busy with construction.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.523
Hey, what's up?

10:08.024 --> 10:09.066
[Brady] Morning.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.818
-Hi.
-[Brady] Um…

10:10.901 --> 10:11.944
I remember you.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.529
Yeah, I remember you.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.157
Basil, right?

10:16.240 --> 10:18.326
No, Hazel.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.161
Oh, Hazel.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.038
-Wasn't oregano? No?
-No.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.539
-No!
-Parsley?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.166
[laughs]

10:25.249 --> 10:26.083
What's going on?

10:26.167 --> 10:28.002
Uh, you know what? We were, um--

10:28.085 --> 10:30.630

10:30.713 --> 10:32.423
I don't want to lie.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.091
We were squatting.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.259
I'm sorry. We just…

10:35.343 --> 10:38.304
We had nowhere to go.
But we're leaving now.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.264

10:40.348 --> 10:41.599
[Jack] Whoa, whoa, wait. Um…

10:42.683 --> 10:44.060
Where are you gonna go?

10:47.146 --> 10:48.689
All right, why don't you, um,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.026
stay here.
You know, until you get settled.

10:52.943 --> 10:53.778
Here?

10:53.861 --> 10:55.821
Yeah, you need a place
to get back on your feet.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.531

is such a good idea.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.464
Why not?

It could be dangerous.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.977
[Brady] Yeah, you're right.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.271
All right.
I'm gonna go check in with Melissa.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.024
Why don't you just go grab them
some supplies?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.109
Yeah, sure thing.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.237
-[Jack] Morning!
-This is a good day.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.906
[Jack] Oh, sure is.
Can't believe we're finally doing this.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.037
[Kaia] This seems like a lot of pomp
and circumstance for bread and eggs.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.956
[Preacher] Oh, easy now, don't be a hater.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.501
This is my infamous

11:50.584 --> 11:51.669
[Kaia] Mmm!

11:51.752 --> 11:52.712
Okay.

-I eat my words. Mm-hmm.
-Right?

11:59.885 --> 12:01.554
This is definitely worth the pomp. Mm-hmm.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.098
-And what about the circumstance?
-It's delicious.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.019
Hey, listen, I know you said
things were over with Jay,

12:09.103 --> 12:11.731
but I get the feeling
that he is not over you.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.857
Why?

12:12.940 --> 12:14.608
He basically told me so.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.737
Like I said,
you don't have to worry about Jay.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.906
But what you might wanna worry about
is what I have planned for us today.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.410
I thought you said that we were gonna,
you know, relax.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.703
[Kaia] Yeah.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.581
Oh, you don't know me really, do you?

12:28.664 --> 12:31.667
No, I prefer a day of thrill
to a day of chill.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.086
Okay. Well, let's do it.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.631
Oh, not until I finish every last bite
of my fancy-ass toast.

-I thought I would finish my baby dress.

-[Muriel chuckles] Oh.
-Oh, isn't that darling?

12:52.062 --> 12:55.691
Oh, the little bird appliqué.
That's a lovely touch.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.817
Thank you.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.904
It, um, reminds me of my mom.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.698
[inhales deeply]
She used to call me her little bird.

13:03.407 --> 13:07.119
So I figured after the fire,
somebody's little bird might need a dress.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.580
-[Muriel] Mmm.
-It's very sweet of you.

on the town gossip?

13:17.254 --> 13:19.256
Now, now, Mel, we do not gossip.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.092
We simply exchange provocative local news.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.677
-Oh.
-For instance,

13:23.761 --> 13:28.682
did you know that Muriel
is shacking up with Cameron?

Well, that is news to me.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.770
Don't make it sound so sordid!

13:32.853 --> 13:35.856
I am staying in his guest room
while my house is being repaired.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.317
I am roommates with his Peloton.

13:38.400 --> 13:43.322
I guess the amenities at my place
weren't as enticing as the good doctor's.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.949

to come back to the clinic.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.675
Oh, yeah, I did.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.135
That's great.
We couldn't do it without you.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.305

even when you were gone.

-[Cameron] It's nice to make it official.
-Yeah.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.645
This might be belaboring the point,

14:14.728 --> 14:19.358
but I wanted you to know that I have seen
firsthand how wrong I was about Jack.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.861
I'm truly sorry for judging him.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.239
Thank you. I appreciate you saying that.

14:25.739 --> 14:28.784
-[Cameron] I'll see you at the office.
-Yeah! See you at the office.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.289
Oh, hey, I was gonna swing by Swinton's
market and pick up some steaks for dinner.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.790
-How does that sound?
-[Muriel] Yeah!

14:34.874 --> 14:36.083

14:47.469 --> 14:50.389

about a full moon, Muriel?

14:50.472 --> 14:53.642

about a full moon, Connie?

will be scrambling to escape here.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.418
Well, on that note,

15:19.501 --> 15:23.422
since, you know, it's gonna be
a little while before we officially open,

15:23.505 --> 15:26.842
I was hoping we could let some
of the displaced evacuees stay here.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.595
I mean, they're sleeping
in the school gym, in their cars.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.222
I think that's a wonderful idea.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.850
All right, I'll let Hope know
that she can lean on us.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.226
-And, Jack?
-Hmm?

15:36.977 --> 15:38.729
Nick told me about your loss.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.689
I'm truly sorry.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.109
And I want you to know you don't have
anything to worry about here.

15:45.402 --> 15:50.074
Thanks. Honestly, I'm, uh,
happy to have the distraction right now,

15:50.157 --> 15:51.700
so once I speak to Hope,

15:51.784 --> 15:55.079
I'll get to work on compiling
those receipts, the work invoices.

to take care of that.

as much time with Mel as you could.

-I draw the line at rides to the airport.
-No, no, my company has a softball team.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.986
We have a game tomorrow,

20:38.070 --> 20:40.739
and our shortstop broke his leg
at a bachelor party in Nashville.

20:40.822 --> 20:44.368
-Ah-ha.
-I was hoping you would sub in maybe?

20:44.451 --> 20:46.453
-You need a ringer.
-Mm-hmm.

20:46.536 --> 20:47.454
[Mike] Mmm.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.207
I mean, who can turn down that face?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.084
-Yeah! Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah.
-Yes?

20:52.167 --> 20:54.044
-Yes!
-Yeah. You up for another round?

20:54.127 --> 20:56.630
-Yeah. If you're getting up. Thank you.
-All right.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.548
[game continues on TV]

20:59.258 --> 21:00.342
[inhales deeply]

21:02.094 --> 21:04.096
[phone chiming]

21:05.180 --> 21:06.640
[pensive music playing]

21:06.723 --> 21:10.143
[commentator on TV] It's a knuckleball
and he swings at it. Strike one!

21:11.395 --> 21:13.397
[commentator continues indistinctly]

21:14.523 --> 21:15.565
[sighs]

21:15.649 --> 21:17.442
[birds chirping]

21:20.696 --> 21:23.282
-[Jack] All the trailers have power now?
-[Brady] Yeah, all set up.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.325
-[Hope] Jack!
-[Jack] Oh, good timing.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.577
You guys want to walk some families
over to the trailers?

21:27.661 --> 21:28.495
I'm on it.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.998
Knights in shining armor.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.332
Thank you, boys.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.500
It's all good.

21:34.584 --> 21:37.421
It's a pretty great thing
you're doing here, Jack.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.090
Well, there but for the grace of God go I.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.302
Oh, and thanks for taking the lead
on all those invoices

21:43.385 --> 21:44.678
and the purchase orders too.

21:44.761 --> 21:45.762
What do you mean?

21:46.263 --> 21:49.725
Well, Melissa said you were gonna organize
all the receipts for the materials,

21:49.808 --> 21:51.184
track the labor costs.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.103
Right! Yeah, of course.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.730
I didn't get much sleep last night,

21:54.813 --> 21:57.899
can barely see straight,
but I'm on top of it. Books are good.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.819
-If you need me to look over your work--
-[Lizzie] Hey, Jack?

22:00.902 --> 22:03.739
They have a question about the AC.
Can you show us how it works?

22:03.822 --> 22:05.240
Oh, yeah, I'll be right there.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.491
-[Lizzie] Thanks!
-Yeah.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.661
I'm on top of it. Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna set up the next family.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.331
Hey, guys, come on.
We're gonna go down to the left.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.000
[Preacher] Today was awesome.

22:15.083 --> 22:18.295
You really like to push me
outside of my comfort zone.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.381
Yeah. Way better
than a day of relaxing, right?

22:21.465 --> 22:26.219
Well, now, it is my turn
to push you out of yours a little.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.183
I want to know what really happened
with you and Jay.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.603
Getting deep and serious is, um… [sighs]

22:34.686 --> 22:36.396
It's kind of new terrain.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.148
Yeah, well, we can take it slow.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.611
Well, um… [exhales]

22:48.575 --> 22:51.161
[inhales deeply]
I met Jay during basic training.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.164
And as you can imagine,
it's a pretty intense environment,

22:54.247 --> 22:55.707
especially if you're a woman.

22:55.791 --> 23:00.212
I was the only one, and the guys
were bothered by my presence, except Jay.

23:01.129 --> 23:03.965
He was welcoming, arrogant, but sweet.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.468
I mistook his smugness for confidence.

23:06.551 --> 23:11.181
Wasn't until after we were married
that I realized he was masking insecurity.

23:11.264 --> 23:14.393
So how long into the marriage
before things…

23:15.811 --> 23:17.104
Year seven.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.773
Things came to a head when we…

23:20.482 --> 23:22.692
we both applied for a promotion
to be team lead.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.361
[Preacher inhales deeply]

23:24.444 --> 23:25.695
Jay got competitive.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.156
Started belittling me
in front of the team,

23:28.240 --> 23:31.243
and because he's a guy and I'm not,

23:31.326 --> 23:34.204
they believed him when he said
she was too fragile for the job.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.873
And Jay got the promotion over you.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.626
He did. And then he asked me
to stop firefighting.

23:40.335 --> 23:42.212
Stay home so we could start a family.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.924
And I just didn't understand
why I had to be the one to quit.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.385
Sorry he put that on you.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.846
Jay wanted me to give up on my dreams.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.265
I refused.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.143
He asked for a divorce.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.311
How do you manage to work with him still?

23:58.395 --> 23:59.354
After all that?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.231
You're in the Marines.

24:01.314 --> 24:04.317
You know what it's like to not get along
with the person you're paired up with.

24:04.401 --> 24:08.530
Yeah, you put your personal issues aside
for the greater good.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.241
-[Kaia] Yeah.
-But you can only do that for so long.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.119
You deserve to get what you want.

24:14.202 --> 24:16.204
All the men in my life
make me feel as though

24:16.288 --> 24:18.498
I should only speak
if I'm standing behind them.

24:19.082 --> 24:23.003
Well, you can stand
wherever you want with me.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.088
[sweet music playing]

24:27.132 --> 24:29.217
Just hold my hand while you do it.

24:33.555 --> 24:36.808
[breathing deeply]

24:40.395 --> 24:42.772
So how much time
do I have left with you anyway?

24:44.274 --> 24:45.817
I'm still waiting to hear.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.113
We can make this work if we want to.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.200
[sweet music continues]

24:56.328 --> 24:58.330
[insects chirping]

24:59.915 --> 25:01.041
[exhales]

25:06.713 --> 25:08.298
[exhales]

25:23.230 --> 25:24.439
[knocking]

25:25.482 --> 25:26.316
Hey.

25:27.484 --> 25:28.443
[Lark] Hi.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.320
I, uh, was just about to head out.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.405
I wanted to see if you guys
needed anything else.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.825
I think you've done enough for one day.
Hazel's conked out already.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.244
Cool.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.454
All right. Well, uh, have a good night.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.830
Hey, uh, Brady?

25:43.500 --> 25:45.585
Do you have time for a beer?

25:45.669 --> 25:48.547
It's the least I could do
after everything you've done for us.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.131
[gentle music playing]

25:50.215 --> 25:51.258
Yeah.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.509
[laughs] Yeah, sure.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.262
-I don't have anywhere to be.
-[Lark chuckles softly]

25:55.887 --> 25:58.348
[upbeat music playing]

25:58.431 --> 26:00.100
[indistinct chatter]

26:00.183 --> 26:01.476
[Brie] That'd be amazing.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.937
Have you ever given
a really impassioned speech

26:04.020 --> 26:05.146
like in A Few Good Men?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.231
[Brie] Oh, yeah. Totally.

26:06.314 --> 26:10.318
Most of my cases end in very Oscar-worthy
soliloquies about truth and honor.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.611
-Really?
-[Brie] No.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.779
[women laugh]

26:12.862 --> 26:16.825
Most of my cases don't even go to trial.
They just end in lame arbitration.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.702
See, I told you
you guys were gonna hit it off.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.328
-What did I say?
-[Brie] Well, we did.

26:21.621 --> 26:25.166
I'm really glad you guys are here.
I needed some girl time.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.126
[Mel] Me too.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.961
Brady and I broke up.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.296
-What?
-[Brie] Mmm.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.256
-Like, officially?
-Yeah.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.882
[Mel] Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.552
-Men. [sighs]
-[Mel] Mmm.

26:35.635 --> 26:38.013
Well, I mean,
that's very easy for you to say.

26:38.096 --> 26:41.224
Oh, no, I'm kind of glad
I'm not the only sad sack here.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.602
-Oh, no, what's wrong?
-[Ava] I just…

26:43.685 --> 26:46.438
feel bad about everything
that happened during the fire.

26:46.521 --> 26:49.482
Oh, Ava, that was completely
out of your control.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.234
No, that's not entirely true.

26:52.235 --> 26:54.696
During the fire,
I was having an endo episode.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.282
The pain got so bad
that I fell and I hit my head.

26:57.365 --> 27:00.327
Well, that still doesn't sound like
it's your fault.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.537
Maybe if I would have settled

27:02.621 --> 27:05.957
on a treatment plan sooner,
I wouldn't have put my sister in danger.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.460
Ava, even if you would have
settled on a treatment plan,

27:08.543 --> 27:10.962
there was no guarantee
you would have been pain-free.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.548
Okay? Thinking like that
is not gonna do you any good.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.466
Right.

27:14.549 --> 27:16.343
And Chloe's safe. That's all that matters.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.970
-Yeah.
-Ugh, I just need to let it all go.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.055
[both] Yes!

27:20.138 --> 27:21.556
-[inhales deeply]
-[Mel] Yes.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.600
Oh, luckily, tonight is a full moon.

27:23.683 --> 27:27.020
Which is the perfect time to let go
of what is no longer serving me.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.563
-You have a fire pit, right?
-Yeah.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.566
Okay. All we need is a crystal,
a notepad, and a pen.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.276
-Do you have a crystal?
-I have no crystal.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.236
-[Ava] Okay.
-[Mel and Brie laughing]

27:35.320 --> 27:37.614
Please tell me
we're not gonna go howl at the moon.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.533
I mean, she's from Portland.
What can I say?

27:43.995 --> 27:45.205
[door opens]

27:45.789 --> 27:46.998
-Hey.
-[Denny] Hi.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.459
Hey, how'd… how'd the interview go?

27:49.542 --> 27:50.543
Oh, well… [sighs]

27:50.627 --> 27:53.380
Bert asked me a bunch of
questions I didn't know the answers to,

27:53.463 --> 27:55.924
and then his wife
gave me this cobbler. So…

27:56.007 --> 27:58.134
-Oh.
-I'm guessing not very well.

27:58.218 --> 28:01.638
That was very nice of Shirley.
Sorry you didn't get the job.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.015
It's okay. Bert said I could apprentice.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.184
It'd be cool to learn
how to restore a classic car.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.186
Yeah! So, uh…

28:09.145 --> 28:10.522
you're looking for a job.

28:11.439 --> 28:14.526
Does that mean you're planning
on staying here in Virgin River?

28:14.609 --> 28:18.238
I am. Yeah, you know I wanted to travel,
but with Lizzie's new job,

28:18.321 --> 28:19.864
we'll just have to put it on hold.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.784
[chuckling] Well,
you get no pressure from me, uh…

28:22.867 --> 28:25.161
Having you here makes me incredibly happy.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.079
Me too.

28:28.331 --> 28:32.293
And, uh…
I don't want to put any pressure on you…

28:34.295 --> 28:35.630
but, um…

28:36.381 --> 28:38.383
Grandma Rose called this morning.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.094
She was wondering
if she could come for a visit.

28:41.761 --> 28:42.846
Oh.

28:42.929 --> 28:46.975
You know, she really wants to meet Lizzie,
see my life here, see you.

28:48.184 --> 28:50.687
I think the wildfires scared her too.

28:50.770 --> 28:54.733
So she threw out tomorrow,
but only if you're okay with it.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.860
And I know
that the two of you haven't spoken

28:56.943 --> 28:58.737
about what happened with my dad, so…

28:58.820 --> 29:01.489
No. No, we, uh… we have not.

29:02.741 --> 29:06.661
But perhaps it…
it's time that we did. [chuckles]

29:06.745 --> 29:09.330
Why don't you let me
discuss this with Hope?

29:09.414 --> 29:10.623
-Really?
-[Doc] Yeah.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.041
Okay. Thank you. I…

29:12.834 --> 29:14.586
You know, I know
it's a complicated situation.

29:14.669 --> 29:15.545
Ah.

29:15.628 --> 29:17.547
[Denny] It means a lot
that you're considering it.

29:19.507 --> 29:22.510
-I'm gonna throw this in the fridge.
-[gentle music playing]

29:25.013 --> 29:26.723
[crickets chirping]

29:27.432 --> 29:30.935
[Muriel laughing]
So then who pulled the fire alarm?

29:31.019 --> 29:34.773
My friend Elias. He was mad that I got
the lead role in Little Shop.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.233
-So--
-Oh, wait. You played Seymour?

29:37.317 --> 29:38.985
-No, the plant.
-Oh.

29:39.068 --> 29:43.656
So the alarm goes off, I climb out
of that massive flytrap costume.

29:43.740 --> 29:47.118
There I am standing on stage
in my tighty-whities

29:47.202 --> 29:49.621
in front of an auditorium full of people.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.248
-Why?
-Because the costume was so damn hot.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.334
[laughing] So, what did you do?

29:54.417 --> 29:59.631
Well, then they evacuated the school
and I stood outside in my underwear,

29:59.714 --> 30:03.301
and anyone that laughed or pointed,
I gave them a little bow.

30:03.384 --> 30:06.471
Okay! So even back then,
you were a class act.

30:06.554 --> 30:07.764
[chuckles]

30:07.847 --> 30:11.768
Sometimes I come up a little bit short,
like with Doc.

30:11.851 --> 30:14.896
-[tsks] Oh…
-And that whole situation with Mel.

30:14.979 --> 30:15.814
[sighs]

30:16.606 --> 30:17.982
I had just got into town,

30:18.066 --> 30:21.194
and just broke things off
with my ex-fiancée,

30:21.277 --> 30:25.156
and then I meet Mel, and she's
all the things that Michelle isn't.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.201
So I thought that I wanted to be with her,

30:28.284 --> 30:29.994
but it had nothing to do with Mel.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.498
Her and I never had
that kind of connection.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.960
So, what are you looking for these days?

30:38.169 --> 30:40.255
I mean, real connections
are hard to come by.

30:40.338 --> 30:44.384
Yes, they are, and…
they can catch you off-guard.

30:44.467 --> 30:47.762
-They can knock you off your feet.
-Just when you least expect it.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.014
-[Muriel] Mm-hmm.
-[romantic music playing]

30:59.023 --> 31:00.400
[sighs heavily]

31:01.025 --> 31:03.194
I am… I'm so sorry, but I…

31:05.196 --> 31:06.239
I can't do this.

31:07.782 --> 31:09.409
I-- I thought you--

31:09.492 --> 31:12.120
No, no, I mean, I want to do this,

31:12.203 --> 31:16.040
but I promised Doc
that I would be more professional, and…

31:16.958 --> 31:18.877
-Well, we--
-Work together.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.086
[Cameron] Right, yeah.

31:22.964 --> 31:23.965
I get it.

31:24.716 --> 31:25.550
I do.

31:27.468 --> 31:29.220
But it would be so sad if…

31:30.763 --> 31:33.349
our first kiss ended up being our last.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.852
[romantic music continues]

31:46.195 --> 31:47.238
[Cameron sighs]

31:47.322 --> 31:49.490
-Good night, Dr. Hayek.
-Mm-hmm.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.576
[music continues]

32:03.546 --> 32:04.797
Dinner is ready!

32:07.133 --> 32:09.052
-Hiya, handsome.
-Hey. [laughs]

32:09.135 --> 32:11.679
Look at this!

32:11.763 --> 32:13.306
You are a sweetheart.

32:13.389 --> 32:15.850
-Oh, I can be.
-[both] Mmm…

32:15.934 --> 32:16.935
How'd it go today?

32:17.435 --> 32:18.436
Oh! [exhales]

32:18.937 --> 32:19.896
Incredible.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.692
I knew the people of Virgin River
would keep showing up for one another.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.445
It's keeping me going.

32:27.528 --> 32:28.905
-Oh!
-Yeah.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.035
[Hope] Mmm.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.329
[sighs]

32:36.913 --> 32:37.997
How was your day?

32:38.081 --> 32:42.293
Denny told me that, um,
Rose wants to come for a visit.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.420
[gentle music playing]

32:44.504 --> 32:45.964
-Really?
-[Doc] Mm-hmm.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.216
-When?
-Tomorrow. And…

32:48.299 --> 32:51.761
And I am considering it.
If it's okay with you, of course.

32:51.844 --> 32:55.181
Are you serious, Vernon?
What are you gonna talk about?

32:55.264 --> 32:58.267
Why she kept your son from you
for 50 years?

32:58.351 --> 33:00.687
-Why she faked her own death?
-I… I know.

33:00.770 --> 33:04.732
I know, but Denny
is part of our lives now,

33:04.816 --> 33:09.195
and I… I'm gonna have to
confront this sooner or later.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.035
Then I guess tomorrow
I finally get to meet Rose Miller.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.161
[scoffs]

33:18.579 --> 33:19.580
[sighs]

33:20.707 --> 33:23.543
-[Lark] Of course. [chuckles]
-[Brady chuckling] Right?

33:24.127 --> 33:26.713
-[Lark] This place is beautiful.
-Yeah.

33:27.213 --> 33:31.092
Thanks so much for…
helping me get settled.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.678
Oh, don't thank me yet.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.596
I'm pretty sure the lake's haunted.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.015
Wait.

33:38.016 --> 33:38.975
Seriously?

33:39.058 --> 33:40.268
I'm just messing with you.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.603
[both chuckle softly]

33:45.064 --> 33:47.066
With everything that's been going on,

33:47.817 --> 33:49.610
ghosts sounds kind of fun.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.530
You're doing everything you can
for your daughter.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.450
I wish my mom was like that.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.745
Yeah, she took off
when I was about Hazel's age.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.291
My dad wasn't the greatest either.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.210
He was a mean man.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.338
Especially to my mom.

34:11.716 --> 34:12.550
Yeah.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.637
-Was he mean to you too?
-[Lark] Yeah.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.890
When I was 15, I…

34:20.016 --> 34:21.601
couldn't take it anymore.

34:21.684 --> 34:26.981
Had to do something, so I stabbed him
in the leg with his hunting knife.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.984
It's the last time he raised a hand to me…

34:30.485 --> 34:31.527
or my mom.

34:33.154 --> 34:33.988
God.

34:34.489 --> 34:35.740
I'm so sorry.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.159
After Hazel was born, I left.

34:39.827 --> 34:42.455
Couldn't let her grow up
thinking that's how men should be.

34:44.916 --> 34:45.792
[exhales sharply]

34:46.334 --> 34:47.960
They can't all be like you.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.213
[gentle music playing]

34:52.131 --> 34:53.257
[inhales deeply]

34:54.300 --> 34:55.176
Um…

34:56.010 --> 34:57.011
I… I should go.

34:58.179 --> 35:01.557
It's getting late
and I should probably get some sleep.

35:02.809 --> 35:06.395
Thanks for the beer, and, uh… company.

35:08.648 --> 35:09.899
[inhales deeply]

35:11.275 --> 35:12.693
Good night, Brady.

35:14.112 --> 35:14.946
Yeah.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.281
Good night, Lark.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.373
[gentle music playing]

35:26.582 --> 35:29.085
To full moons and letting go.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.711
-Letting go.
-Letting go.

35:30.795 --> 35:31.629
[Mel laughs]

35:34.590 --> 35:37.301
So, uh, what are we writing on these pads?

35:37.385 --> 35:39.804
We are gonna write down
whatever is bothering us

35:39.887 --> 35:41.472
and then let it burn.

35:42.014 --> 35:46.727
Then we're gonna let the moon heal us
and manifest good energy into our lives.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.021
-[Brie] Okay.
-Okay.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.773
[Mel inhales deeply] Uh…

35:54.402 --> 35:55.945
[Ava] Okay! Now…

35:56.571 --> 35:57.655
Mmm.

35:59.574 --> 36:00.992
Goodbye, guilt.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.120
Losing the farm wasn't my fault.

36:06.831 --> 36:07.707
[exhales sharply]

36:07.790 --> 36:09.250
[Brie] Um… [sighs]

36:09.792 --> 36:11.669
[inhales deeply]

36:11.752 --> 36:12.753
Goodbye, Brady.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.133
I really wish things
could have been different.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.010
Thought maybe we could…

36:19.677 --> 36:22.054
I don't know, heal each other.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.309
[exhales]

36:30.563 --> 36:33.191
-You are up.
-My turn, um…

36:35.026 --> 36:35.902
Okay.

36:36.402 --> 36:37.403
Um…

36:39.280 --> 36:40.948
Uh… [clears throat]

36:41.616 --> 36:44.327
I want to, uh, let go of…

36:46.621 --> 36:47.830
my fear.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.210
My fear of, uh…

36:53.502 --> 36:56.005
trying again
and experiencing another loss.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.509
[somber music playing]

37:13.481 --> 37:14.440
I'm sorry, I don't…

37:15.316 --> 37:17.068
I… I… I get it.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.320
It's just a piece of paper
and I should be…

37:21.405 --> 37:23.908
I just… I can't do it. I…

37:24.617 --> 37:26.786
-I'm just--
-I'm so sorry. I…

37:27.370 --> 37:29.830
I never meant for this
to make you feel worse.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.207
No. No, it's fine.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.458
I mean, I… I…

37:32.541 --> 37:36.254
I thought that I was moving past this.
I… I did. I just…

37:37.213 --> 37:38.506
I'm a mess. I don't…

37:39.215 --> 37:42.134
No, no. No apologies necessary.

37:42.218 --> 37:45.429
-If we can't take you at your worst, then…
-We don't deserve you at your best.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.347
[Brie] Yeah.

37:47.139 --> 37:48.516
[voice breaking] Thank you.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.726
I think, um…

37:54.021 --> 37:57.775
what always got me through my grief
before was that… [inhales deeply]

37:58.651 --> 38:02.029
I had that hope that the next time
was gonna be different.

38:05.950 --> 38:10.579
[crying softly] But this was
supposed to be that next time for me.

38:11.497 --> 38:12.623
And it's not.

38:15.584 --> 38:19.463
And I just… I don't think
I can believe in that anymore.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.384
[somber music continues]

38:23.926 --> 38:24.802
Ugh.

38:25.511 --> 38:27.513
[music continues]

38:38.566 --> 38:40.234
[Brady] Mind getting off my bike?

38:43.821 --> 38:45.281
You're here kinda late.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.658
Burning the midnight oil?

38:48.284 --> 38:51.412
Just making sure people are taken care of
and everything's locked up tight.

38:51.996 --> 38:55.166
Melissa appreciates
how smoothly you ran everything today.

38:56.083 --> 38:56.917
I do too.

38:57.793 --> 38:58.878
Well, good.

38:58.961 --> 38:59.837
Thank you.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.299
That said,
Jack is asking to see the books.

39:04.633 --> 39:08.512
We want you to make sure
whatever he sees satisfies his curiosity.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.015
Yeah, well,
I can't cook the books for Jack

39:11.098 --> 39:12.725
unless I know what's really going on.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.145
Are you gonna fill me in or what?

39:17.355 --> 39:18.689
Lift up your shirt.

39:19.982 --> 39:20.816
[scoffs]

39:21.400 --> 39:22.234
What?

39:22.318 --> 39:23.486
Your shirt.

39:23.569 --> 39:24.487
Why?

39:24.570 --> 39:25.404
You know why.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.907
What, you…
you think I'm wearing a wire? [laughs]

39:27.990 --> 39:29.492
That's exactly what I think.

39:29.575 --> 39:33.079
If this is gonna work,
you two need to start trusting me.

39:33.162 --> 39:35.456
[tense music playing]

39:46.050 --> 39:46.926
Happy?

Mmm.

[door opens]

40:03.150 --> 40:04.026
[Jack] Hey.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.238
Hey.

40:08.614 --> 40:11.075
How was your day?
Did the families get settled?

40:11.158 --> 40:13.411
Yeah, they did. [sighs]

40:14.328 --> 40:15.996
Felt good to help. [sighs]

40:16.997 --> 40:18.541
Mmm. Yeah.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.584
I know the feeling.

40:21.085 --> 40:21.919
[Jack] Hmm?

40:22.545 --> 40:24.255
I'm going back to the clinic.

40:25.297 --> 40:26.549
[Jack] Oh.

40:26.632 --> 40:28.008
Of course you are.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.052
Oh, babe, that's great.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.432
I mean, I get why you left, but… [sighs]

40:35.433 --> 40:37.226
But I'm sure when we get pregnant,

40:37.309 --> 40:40.062
you'll figure out a way to stay involved
for as long as you want.

I think I'm done.

-With what?

40:57.788 --> 40:58.622

[Mel crying] I know. I'm sorry. It's just…

41:01.834 --> 41:02.835
This has been…

just such an emotional roller coaster
for me and I…

I'm so tired.
