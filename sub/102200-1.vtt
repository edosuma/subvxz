developing a new medicine

07:14.809 --> 07:17.395

amount of eosinophils

07:17.395 --> 07:19.355

a Halloween bash.

your father instead,

11:19.178 --> 11:20.846

Your father had all

15:31.847 --> 15:34.516
- You don't threaten
anybody in my gym.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.101
You hear?

15:36.101 --> 15:36.936
Get it?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.607
What are you guys
are looking at?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.067
Go, showers, now.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.615
- [Megan] Are you okay?

15:49.615 --> 15:52.534
- Yeah, yeah, I'm great.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.953
- Wow, that was really--

15:53.953 --> 15:58.082
- Do you want to go to Chad's
Halloween party with me?

15:59.041 --> 15:59.875
- Sure.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.252
- Really?

16:04.463 --> 16:05.297
Okay.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.306
Okay.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.904
- I cannot believe that Dillon
Copeland threatened me today.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.156
What's wrong with that kid?

16:32.116 --> 16:34.618
Like oh no, I'm so scared.

16:34.618 --> 16:38.080
His limbs are like, this thick.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.832
He's a little twig boy.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.041
- Like a toothpick.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.334
- Yeah.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.293
There's something
stuck in my teeth,

16:43.293 --> 16:44.628
go get Dillon Copeland.

16:44.628 --> 16:45.838
Little twig.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.133
It's embarrassing, it really is.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.843
I don't know what Megan
sees in him, honestly.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.012
- Man, I wouldn't
even worry about it.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.638
There's a lotta
chicks out there.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.306
Like this one chick
named Samantha.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.436
- Talk to me about
Samantha later.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.395
- Oh shit.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.813
- We've got a buddy right here.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.524
How ya doing?

17:07.026 --> 17:07.943
How was school?

17:07.943 --> 17:08.902
- What do you want Travis?

17:08.902 --> 17:10.362
- Well, I just wanted to say

17:10.362 --> 17:13.115
that if you ever threaten
me again like that,

17:13.115 --> 17:15.576
I will kick your ass.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.162
- Leave me alone, man.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.705
- How's this sound?

17:19.705 --> 17:21.165
I'll kick your ass

17:21.165 --> 17:22.708
and then I'll leave you alone.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.542
Huh?

17:24.460 --> 17:25.836
Why are you running?

17:25.836 --> 17:27.963
This isn't track
and field, buddy.

17:27.963 --> 17:28.797
Slow down.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.509
(dramatic music)

17:38.015 --> 17:38.849
(slam)

17:38.849 --> 17:39.683
(laughs)

17:39.683 --> 17:40.517
(punch)

17:40.517 --> 17:41.393
- Mess with Travis,

17:41.393 --> 17:42.269
you mess with me, bitch!

17:42.269 --> 17:43.353
- Take that Copeland.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.188
[Dillon] - Argh!

17:45.147 --> 17:47.399
- All right, Copeland.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.233
(smash)

17:49.318 --> 17:51.111
Come here.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.279
Glasses, sweetheart.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.113
(crack)

17:53.113 --> 17:53.947
Thank you.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.076
See you in school, Copeland.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.667
(inaudible voice)

18:11.090 --> 18:13.550
- Did you threaten
Travis in gym class?

18:13.550 --> 18:14.843
- Ah, no.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.053
- Did you threaten him?

18:16.053 --> 18:18.013
- Yes, but he,

18:18.013 --> 18:19.181
I didn't mean it.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.891
He gets away with everything.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.434
- Look, let me
handle this alright?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.061
Suspending him is not
going to resolve anything.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.980
Fine, I swear though, one day

18:26.980 --> 18:28.899
if those bullies lay a
hand on my nephew again,

18:28.899 --> 18:30.442
I will personally

18:30.442 --> 18:31.610
Nevermind.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.946
You calm down.

18:33.946 --> 18:34.780
I am calm!

18:39.159 --> 18:40.702
You just earned
yourself some chores.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.412
I hope you're happy.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.250
And you can have this
back on Saturday.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.709
- You can't be serious.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.253
He started it, not me!

18:49.253 --> 18:51.004
- And don't think for a
minute, you're sleeping in,

18:51.004 --> 18:52.589
or playing video games all day.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.007
I'm giving Mary the
day off tomorrow.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.717
You're the housekeeper.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.147
(gun shots)

19:14.820 --> 19:16.655
- Hey mom, you want to hurry
up with that bagel pizza?

19:16.655 --> 19:18.448
I'm getting hungry, sweetheart.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.327
Hey, behind you,
behind you, behind you.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.579
Come on, shit.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.497
What the hell was that man?

19:25.497 --> 19:26.832
I thought you said you
knew how to play this.

19:26.832 --> 19:27.958
- I do.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.209
- Well, it's not
looking like it.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.628
Not looking like
it at all, Lance.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.629
Spit it out.

19:32.629 --> 19:33.755
What's going on with you?

19:33.755 --> 19:35.007
You've been weird.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.341
- I feel bad about
that Dillon guy.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.843
- You kidding me?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.178
He deserved it.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.679
- He's never had
no beef with me.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.014
He seems like a decent kid.

19:42.848 --> 19:43.682
(thud)

19:43.682 --> 19:44.516
Cry into that.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.350
- What the hell man?

19:45.350 --> 19:46.643
- Cry into that man.

19:46.643 --> 19:47.436
And the next time you
complain about Dillon

19:47.436 --> 19:48.645
getting his ass kicked,

19:48.645 --> 19:51.523
I promise you I
will kick your ass.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.858
Okay?

19:52.858 --> 19:54.151
- Yeah, okay.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.360
- Quit your whining, all right.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.362
My sister has Powder
Princess Four on here,

19:57.362 --> 19:58.530
a little more your speed.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.907
Huh, pink princesses?

19:59.907 --> 20:01.325
- Yeah, yeah, let's
just play the game.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.159
- Give me that smile.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.577
Give me that smile.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.579
We're not going to play
until you give me that smile.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.413
There we go.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.539
Yeah.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.707
Just joshing, man.

20:08.707 --> 20:09.875
I'm just messing.

20:09.875 --> 20:10.709
Okay?

20:11.710 --> 20:12.878
Okay.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.046
Okay, behind you,
come on, there we go.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.005
That's your chance.

20:15.005 --> 20:15.714
Let's fix your last time.

20:15.714 --> 20:16.715
Okay, all right.

20:16.715 --> 20:17.674
- Bam!

20:17.674 --> 20:19.051
- Yeah, there we go, buddy.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.594
Yeah, there's my man.
- Your boy.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.929
- Yeah, he's back.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.138
Yeah.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.641
L-Dog just smashed
your house, big boss.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.558
- Hey, let him
know. Let him know.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.434
- How does that make you feel?

20:27.434 --> 20:28.602
Now you're a small boss.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.561
Huh?

20:29.561 --> 20:30.896
- I see what you did there.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.147
- No one wants to
talk to a small boss.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.399
That's not imposing. Ha ha.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.400
Loser.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.445
(birds chirping)

20:45.452 --> 20:46.245
(door shuts)

20:48.372 --> 20:49.164
- Dillon.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.917
[Dillon] - Yeah?

20:51.917 --> 20:53.585
- The list of chores
is on the island.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.337
You do a good job, we'll
do something tonight.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.421
All right?

20:56.421 --> 20:58.507
Ramos pizza sound good?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.759
- Yeah, sounds good.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.469
- I'll be home around six.

21:09.768 --> 21:10.602
(radio)

21:17.401 --> 21:19.278
(doorbell)

21:22.614 --> 21:25.492
(knocking on door)

21:27.744 --> 21:28.578
- Hey.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.291
You okay?

21:33.125 --> 21:33.959
- Yeah.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.502
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.629
Great, actually,

21:37.629 --> 21:39.423
now that you're here.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.925
- I can't believe
they suspended you.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.885
Travis is such a jerk.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.012
- Yeah.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.764
Well, I'd better get to school.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.974
- Yeah, I,

21:48.974 --> 21:51.268
I've got a lot of
chores to get done, so

21:52.144 --> 21:53.979
- Text me later?

21:53.979 --> 21:56.064

34:54.342 --> 34:57.637
You forgot to put the
gardening tools away.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.597
You look pale, you
feel all right?

35:00.973 --> 35:03.559
Put those tools away and
call that girl, Megan.

35:03.559 --> 35:06.270
She's been blowing
your phone up all day.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.650
Come on, get ready,
be ready in 10, okay?

35:10.650 --> 35:11.984
- For what?

35:11.984 --> 35:14.112
- Pizza, did you forget?

35:14.112 --> 35:15.947
- [Derrick] Guess I did.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.574
- Must be all the fumes from
those cleaning supplies.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.662
(eerie music)

35:26.958 --> 35:29.335
(Italian music)

35:48.646 --> 35:50.231
- I've never seen
you eat so much.

35:50.231 --> 35:53.067
What'd you do,
swallow a tapeworm?

36:04.662 --> 36:07.665
- What's in the
basement, Uncle Max?

36:11.794 --> 36:13.838
Oh, come on.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.090
You can tell me.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.717
I'll keep it

36:17.717 --> 36:19.385
our little secret.

36:20.928 --> 36:24.140
- Can I get you
anything else tonight?

36:24.140 --> 36:25.057
- No.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.851
Just a check.

36:26.851 --> 36:27.685
- Okay.

36:27.685 --> 36:28.686
There you go.

36:28.686 --> 36:29.645
Thanks for coming in.

36:29.645 --> 36:30.855
You have a wonderful evening.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.274
Please come back
and see us again.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.197
- Look, you're pissed
about the chores.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.948
I get it.

36:40.948 --> 36:42.408
But I had to teach you a lesson.

36:42.408 --> 36:44.619
You can't go around
threatening people.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.205

feel your touch ♪

[Tammy] - Dillon.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.168
Jackson's here.

(popping)

37:39.674 --> 37:41.259
(eerie music)

37:46.764 --> 37:48.474
- I can still get it in three.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.561
Hey, you can't keep doing that.

37:57.275 --> 38:00.611
(eerie music)

38:11.580 --> 38:12.498
[Mark] - Oh my gosh.

38:12.498 --> 38:13.457
What happened to the dog?

38:13.457 --> 38:14.625
- We don't know, we were asleep.

38:14.625 --> 38:15.918
[Jackson] - You're
not going to blame me.

38:15.918 --> 38:16.627
- Just tell us what
happened to the dog.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.461
- Nothing!

38:17.461 --> 38:18.546
We woke up and

38:18.546 --> 38:19.964
The dog was dead.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.465
[Jackson] - Yeah.

38:21.465 --> 38:22.842
(eerie music)

38:24.010 --> 38:25.428
I woke up and he
wasn't breathing,

38:25.428 --> 38:26.387
and there was blood everywhere.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.221
- Okay.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.140
(eerie music)

38:29.140 --> 38:30.308
- It wasn't us.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.271
[Jackson] - We don't know.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.355
[Tammy] - You guys
know something.

38:36.355 --> 38:37.898
You have to know something.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.984
[Young Dillon] - How would
we know if we were asleep?

38:41.736 --> 38:44.322

40:52.575 --> 40:53.534

40:53.534 --> 40:54.785
[Dillon] - Help me!

40:54.785 --> 40:56.454
Somebody help me.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.164
Uncle Max.

41:00.499 --> 41:01.292
Uncle Max?

41:04.378 --> 41:07.631
- Found some waffles
in the freezer.

41:07.631 --> 41:08.924
(rustling)

41:18.058 --> 41:19.143
Eat.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.490
- Who are you?

41:33.824 --> 41:35.493
- You know who I am.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.915
There's a jar in there

41:40.915 --> 41:42.500
if you need to pee.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.044
The other --

41:45.044 --> 41:47.796
You're on your own.

41:47.796 --> 41:49.798
- Please, please
get me out of here.

41:49.798 --> 41:51.759
I'll do anything for you.

41:51.759 --> 41:55.471
I, my uncle, he has,
he has money, cars.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.806
- Your uncle is dead.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.519
I killed that
bastard last night.

42:02.561 --> 42:03.521
(pills rattling)

42:03.521 --> 42:05.272
Reminds me.

42:05.272 --> 42:07.525
He loved to give me
these little treats.

42:08.567 --> 42:11.028
Delicious, aren't they?

42:13.739 --> 42:14.573

(slow suspenseful music)

43:07.001 --> 43:08.711
(phone vibrating)

43:13.173 --> 43:15.301
- Did you enjoy your day off?

43:15.301 --> 43:17.052
- Can you drive?

43:17.052 --> 43:18.762
- You know I do.

43:18.762 --> 43:19.847
- Pick me up.

43:21.223 --> 43:23.267
- I have to finish
a little homework.

43:24.184 --> 43:26.854
- Do you want to date me or not?

43:29.106 --> 43:31.775
- Okay, give me like 10 minutes.

43:42.953 --> 43:43.954
[Mark] - I can't think
with that thing up.

43:43.954 --> 43:44.788
Put it back in the case.

43:44.788 --> 43:45.998
- He needs help.

43:45.998 --> 43:46.957
We need to take him
to the hospital.

43:46.957 --> 43:47.875
[Young Derrick] - It's mine.

43:47.875 --> 43:48.792
- No, we've discussed this.

43:48.792 --> 43:49.627
We're taking him to a facility.

43:49.627 --> 43:50.294
[Young Dillon] - Stop!

43:50.294 --> 43:51.545
- This is wrong.

43:51.545 --> 43:52.463
I can't do this. I
won't to do this.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.422
[Young Dillon] - Help me.

43:53.422 --> 43:54.214
[Mark] - Shut up back there.

43:54.214 --> 43:54.757
- Let go, Derrick, now.

43:54.757 --> 43:55.716
- Hey.

43:55.716 --> 43:56.634
- Keep your eyes on the road.

43:56.634 --> 43:57.885
- Stop.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.136
- This is the best
thing for him, okay.

43:59.136 --> 44:00.304
We have to.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.263
- Derrick, stop.

44:01.263 --> 44:02.431
- Hey.

44:02.431 --> 44:03.891
Give it.
- Keep your eyes on the road.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.851
Stop!

44:05.851 --> 44:07.311
Stop!

44:07.311 --> 44:08.145
Stop!

44:08.145 --> 44:09.313
(truck horn honking)

44:09.313 --> 44:10.272
(screeching tires)

44:10.272 --> 44:11.106
(crashing)

44:15.694 --> 44:17.321
(indistinct conversations)

44:20.824 --> 44:22.076
[Derrick] - How do you change

44:22.076 --> 44:24.411
the security stuff
on this thing?

44:24.411 --> 44:25.704
- New phone?

44:25.704 --> 44:26.538
- Yeah.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.375
- Watch this.

44:32.878 --> 44:34.004
Hey Copeland.

44:34.004 --> 44:35.005
How you doing?

44:35.005 --> 44:35.964
That your phone?

44:35.964 --> 44:37.299
Cute.

44:37.299 --> 44:38.425
[Megan] - Hey, jerk.

44:38.425 --> 44:39.677
- Stay out of this.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.512
- Hey Megan, you
look sweet today.

44:41.512 --> 44:42.721
(clearing throat)

44:42.721 --> 44:44.765
You grow some balls over
the weekend, Copeland?

44:44.765 --> 44:46.225
- One of us has to have them.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.184
(chuckles)

44:47.184 --> 44:48.686
[Travis] - I've got balls.

44:48.686 --> 44:49.853
(thwack)

44:49.853 --> 44:51.063
[Student] - Oh my god.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.189
(intense music)

44:52.189 --> 44:53.023
(punching)

44:54.358 --> 44:55.192
[Travis] - You mother --

44:55.192 --> 44:56.694
(punching)

44:56.694 --> 44:59.196
- You better stop or I
will gut you like a deer.

44:59.196 --> 45:00.030
(chuckling)

45:00.030 --> 45:01.865
- You won't do shit.

45:01.865 --> 45:02.700
[Derrick] - Oh really?

45:04.535 --> 45:06.412
(choking)

45:07.538 --> 45:08.956
(punching)

45:08.956 --> 45:10.499
[Lance] - Now that's
just too much.

45:14.712 --> 45:16.380
[Derrick] - Let's
get out of here.

45:18.674 --> 45:19.508
- Chad.

45:19.508 --> 45:20.551
- You all right?

45:20.551 --> 45:21.802
- You shut up

45:21.802 --> 45:23.011
and you help me.

45:23.011 --> 45:23.971
- Come on, come on.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.305
- Where the hell were you guys?

45:25.305 --> 45:26.515
[Lance] - We thought
you had it, man.

45:26.515 --> 45:27.433
- I was getting my
ass kicked back there.

45:27.433 --> 45:28.809
[Chad] - Okay, calm down.

45:28.809 --> 45:29.643
[Travis] - No, get off.

45:29.643 --> 45:30.477
[Chad] - Calm down.

45:30.477 --> 45:31.353
[Travis] - Shit.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.731
(soft music)

45:34.982 --> 45:35.816
(doors shutting)

45:37.067 --> 45:38.235
[Megan] - I mean,

45:38.235 --> 45:39.236
What you did to Travis

45:39.236 --> 45:40.654
was kind of harsh, but

45:40.654 --> 45:41.739
He deserved it.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.701
What are you smirking at?

45:45.701 --> 45:46.910
- Nothing.

45:46.910 --> 45:48.579
- Yes you are.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.581
- Maybe because I'm here
holding hands with you.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.919
Those guys are watching us.

45:55.919 --> 45:57.629
- No one's watching us.

45:57.629 --> 45:58.464
(kiss)

45:58.464 --> 45:59.381
(chuckle)

45:59.381 --> 46:00.382
- Come on.
- Now they are.

46:00.382 --> 46:02.259
- Let's go find a costume.

46:02.259 --> 46:04.762
They've got all kinds
of crazy masks and wigs.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.181
(soft music)

46:31.955 --> 46:35.125
Dillon, you scared me.

46:35.125 --> 46:37.795
[Derrick] - Oh,
I'm gonna get this.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.880
- This'll go perfect with it.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.058
That's sick.

46:51.058 --> 46:52.059
I'm buying it.

46:52.059 --> 46:52.893
My treat.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.646
[Derrick] - I like it.

46:56.730 --> 46:58.357
Now teach me to drive.

47:01.693 --> 47:02.736
(birds chirping)

47:04.321 --> 47:05.823
(kissing)

47:07.991 --> 47:10.160
(phone vibrating)

47:11.453 --> 47:12.454
- I think it's my mom.

47:12.454 --> 47:14.331
I have to,

47:14.331 --> 47:15.999
Dillon, I'm serious.

47:17.042 --> 47:17.876
- Fine.

47:20.254 --> 47:21.755
- I was supposed to call my mom.

47:21.755 --> 47:22.965
She's pissed.

47:25.008 --> 47:26.301
Grounded?

47:26.301 --> 47:27.135
For what?

47:29.221 --> 47:31.306
For not vacuuming.

47:31.306 --> 47:32.432
What the fuck?

47:37.354 --> 47:39.022
- Pick me up in the morning?

47:39.022 --> 47:41.191
- If they don't
take my car keys.

47:41.191 --> 47:42.276
I can't believe this.

47:42.276 --> 47:43.443
Chad's party's tomorrow.

47:43.443 --> 47:44.903
I'm grounded til Monday.

47:46.029 --> 47:48.657
- I'll make sure
you go to the party.

47:48.657 --> 47:50.284
I promise.

47:50.284 --> 47:51.201
- You promise?

47:51.201 --> 47:52.244
What are you going to do?

47:52.244 --> 47:53.370
Negotiate my release?

47:55.122 --> 47:56.832
- I'll think of something.

48:00.544 --> 48:02.671
(eerie music)

48:09.761 --> 48:11.013
- Relax.

48:18.270 --> 48:20.772
Your uncle fed me garbage.

48:20.772 --> 48:22.399
No meat, ever.

48:25.861 --> 48:28.906
He tried to feed me
moldy spaghetti once.

48:32.200 --> 48:34.453
He ended up wearing it.

48:34.453 --> 48:36.580
Boy, he was pissed.

48:38.498 --> 48:42.085
[Dillon] - My thumb is infected.

48:42.085 --> 48:43.211
- What thumb?

48:44.087 --> 48:46.173
(laughing)

48:51.261 --> 48:52.638
It's fine, eat.

48:55.682 --> 48:58.310
Ugh, smells like an
outhouse down here.

48:59.353 --> 49:01.396
- I hear water upstairs, let me,

49:01.396 --> 49:02.773
let me go wash up.

49:02.773 --> 49:03.857
- Mmmm, no.

49:03.857 --> 49:05.108
- I'm filthy.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.363
(eerie music)

49:14.201 --> 49:15.869
(splash)

49:15.869 --> 49:16.954
(coughing)

49:24.086 --> 49:27.673
- You have a scrapbook
of the accident.

49:27.673 --> 49:30.467
Do you remember any of it?

49:31.510 --> 49:32.344
- No.

49:35.847 --> 49:37.641
You can't keep me in
here like some animal,

I'm back in route
to 239 Roberts Road.

1:10:01.405 --> 1:10:02.489
[Dispatcher] - But Sheriff --

1:10:02.489 --> 1:10:03.782
- That's a direct order.

1:10:03.782 --> 1:10:04.700
(engine starts)

1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:05.910
[Dispatcher] - Copy that.

1:10:10.706 --> 1:10:12.082
(soft music)

1:10:17.213 --> 1:10:18.255
- Dillon?

1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:23.969
Dillon?

1:10:29.266 --> 1:10:32.102
[Derrick] - You think
you're one smart bitch,

1:10:32.102 --> 1:10:33.312
don't you?

1:10:33.312 --> 1:10:34.730
(dramatic music)

1:10:34.730 --> 1:10:35.564
(cage rattles)

1:10:35.564 --> 1:10:36.774
[Dillon] - Megan!

1:10:36.774 --> 1:10:37.733
[Derrick] - I brought
you some company,

1:10:37.733 --> 1:10:39.652
if she can stand the smell.

1:10:39.652 --> 1:10:40.486
(stab)

1:10:40.486 --> 1:10:41.320
[Derrick] - Ahhh!

1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:42.446
(cage rattles)

1:10:42.446 --> 1:10:43.489
[Dillon] - Run, go!

1:10:44.949 --> 1:10:46.325
(suspenseful music)

1:10:46.325 --> 1:10:47.868
(scrape)

1:10:47.868 --> 1:10:49.078
(sirens blaring)

1:10:49.078 --> 1:10:50.412
[Megan] - Hurry.

1:10:50.412 --> 1:10:51.372
[Sheriff Adler] - Hey,
what's going on here?

1:10:51.372 --> 1:10:52.206
- They're in the basement.

1:10:52.206 --> 1:10:52.748
He's going to kill him.

1:10:52.748 --> 1:10:53.749
- Who?

1:10:53.749 --> 1:10:54.458
- Dillon, he's gonna kill him!

1:10:54.458 --> 1:10:55.584
- Wait here.

1:10:56.710 --> 1:10:58.420
- Don't, don't kill me.

1:10:58.420 --> 1:10:59.880
[Derrick] - Why not?

1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:01.298
You killed me.

1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:05.302
- What are you talking about?

1:11:05.302 --> 1:11:08.013
[Derrick] - I'm talking
about my life, Dillon.

1:11:08.013 --> 1:11:10.182
The one you stole from me!

1:11:13.769 --> 1:11:15.271
Recognize me?

1:11:18.857 --> 1:11:19.692
- No.

1:11:19.692 --> 1:11:20.526
No, it --

1:11:21.777 --> 1:11:23.195
You died in --

1:11:23.195 --> 1:11:25.698
You died in the accident.
- He lied to you!

1:11:26.865 --> 1:11:29.285
I could hear the two
of you having fun.

1:11:29.285 --> 1:11:31.996
Making vacation plans.

1:11:31.996 --> 1:11:36.166
You always playing
that fucking piano.

1:11:36.166 --> 1:11:37.960
It should've been me!

1:11:41.964 --> 1:11:43.549
[Young Derrick] - Please
don't leave me down here.

1:11:43.549 --> 1:11:44.425
I'm sorry.

1:11:44.425 --> 1:11:45.259
I didn't mean to.

1:11:45.259 --> 1:11:46.051
I just got mad.

1:11:47.303 --> 1:11:49.263
Please, don't leave me.

1:11:49.263 --> 1:11:50.597
Please.

1:11:50.597 --> 1:11:51.390
(cage rattling)

1:11:52.683 --> 1:11:54.143
Please.

1:11:54.143 --> 1:11:55.811
(dramatic music)

1:11:57.980 --> 1:11:59.565
- How could you be my brother?

1:11:59.565 --> 1:12:01.233
You tried to kill me!

1:12:01.233 --> 1:12:02.568
[Derrick] - Arrgh!

1:12:02.568 --> 1:12:04.320
- I didn't even
know you existed!

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:05.154
(swoosh)

1:12:05.154 --> 1:12:05.988
(grunting)

1:12:06.864 --> 1:12:08.449
(dramatic music)

1:12:08.449 --> 1:12:09.283
(punch)

1:12:16.999 --> 1:12:17.875
(thud)

1:12:17.875 --> 1:12:18.709
(whack)

1:12:18.709 --> 1:12:19.752
[Dillon] - Owww!

1:12:19.752 --> 1:12:20.586
(clash)

1:12:20.586 --> 1:12:21.420
[Derrick] - Arrgh!

1:12:21.420 --> 1:12:22.504
(punch)

1:12:22.504 --> 1:12:23.339
(clang)

1:12:25.924 --> 1:12:26.759
(thump)

1:12:26.759 --> 1:12:28.344
[Derrick] - Ahhh!

1:12:28.344 --> 1:12:29.178
(cage crashing)

1:12:38.187 --> 1:12:39.021
- Go on.

1:12:40.647 --> 1:12:41.482
Kill me.

1:12:43.984 --> 1:12:46.862
[Derrick] - I'm already
dead to this family anyways.

1:12:50.449 --> 1:12:51.992
(cage rattling)

1:12:53.535 --> 1:12:54.328
(slow suspenseful music)

1:12:56.997 --> 1:12:57.956
[Derrick] - Do it!

1:13:02.211 --> 1:13:03.796
- Drop your weapon.

1:13:05.089 --> 1:13:06.090
Drop it now!

1:13:08.926 --> 1:13:10.928
Get out of here, Dillon.

1:13:13.639 --> 1:13:15.265
Drop your weapon.

1:13:15.265 --> 1:13:16.558
[Derrick] - Do it!

1:13:16.558 --> 1:13:19.228
- I am ordering you
to drop your weapon.

1:13:19.228 --> 1:13:20.854
Or I will shoot in three,

1:13:20.854 --> 1:13:21.897
[Derrick] - I've been tortured!

1:13:21.897 --> 1:13:22.731
- Two,

1:13:22.731 --> 1:13:23.565
[Derrick] - God damn --

1:13:23.565 --> 1:13:24.566
- One!

1:13:25.526 --> 1:13:26.902
(knife clanks)

1:13:28.070 --> 1:13:29.488
On your knees.

1:13:34.701 --> 1:13:35.828
Don't move!

1:13:40.624 --> 1:13:42.751
(soft music)

1:14:04.773 --> 1:14:06.400
[Deputy Paisley] - At
least the twins are alive.

1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:07.609
[Sheriff Adler] - Yeah.

1:14:07.609 --> 1:14:08.777
Wish I could say the
same for Mr. Copeland.

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:12.781
(soft music)

1:14:22.666 --> 1:14:23.500
(door shuts)

1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:27.379
- Well, hopefully it'll be a
lot quieter around here now.

1:14:27.379 --> 1:14:30.466
- Yeah, I have a
feeling it's gonna be.

1:14:30.466 --> 1:14:31.633
(soft music)

1:14:39.141 --> 1:14:39.975
(door shuts)

1:14:54.239 --> 1:14:55.282
(engine accelerates)

1:15:08.170 --> 1:15:10.047
(suspenseful music)

1:15:13.717 --> 1:15:15.719
(crickets chirping)

1:15:19.181 --> 1:15:21.642
(dramatic music)

1:18:23.699 --> 1:18:27.869
(piano music)

1:19:02.738 --> 1:19:05.240
(soft piano music)
