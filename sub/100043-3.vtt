WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.252
Lily, sweetie?

00:02.336 --> 00:04.046
Do you want me
to pack your bathing suit for the party?

00:04.046 --> 00:05.839
Only if you want to wear it.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.133
Is that the sass we love
or the backtalk we hate?

00:08.217 --> 00:10.886
Unclear. You know, there's a fine line
between quippy and mean.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.222
I show her <i>Golden Girls.</i>
It's just not sinking in.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.848
Okay. Honey?

00:14.932 --> 00:16.391
Honey, it's going to be fun.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.393
Longinus said lots of kids
are gonna be there.

00:18.477 --> 00:22.648
Exactly. I'm not gonna wear a bathing suit
in front of a bunch of judgy tweens.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.651
It's Daddy time.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.530
Now? Shouldn't we go talk to Lily?

00:30.155 --> 00:31.156
Oh.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.201
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.327
Oh, hell.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.955
Honey, what have we always taught you?

00:37.955 --> 00:40.457
- Love who you are, as you are.
- Yes!

00:40.541 --> 00:42.125
Being comfortable in your skin

00:42.209 --> 00:43.961
- is the most attractive thing.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.504
I mean, look at us.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.798
We're hardly Christy Turlington
and Naomi Campbell...

00:47.798 --> 00:48.882
Could've picked dudes.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.718
But we know what we have to offer,
and we're proud of it.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.971
It's important that you go to this party

00:53.971 --> 00:56.181
and you feel good about who you are.

00:56.431 --> 00:59.726
- I mean, you have a gorgeous body.
- No, thank you.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.687
- Yeah, you're a little hottie!
- Pass.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.438
I mean, if I was a cartoon wolf,
and I saw you,

01:03.522 --> 01:05.274
- my eyes would be like...
- Stop!

01:05.274 --> 01:07.776
I will go if you never
talk to me like this again!

01:22.165 --> 01:25.836
So, Mr. Boss,
how did I do at the open house?

01:25.836 --> 01:29.673
Honestly, your vibe was kind of tense,
and the staging was so-so.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.759
This is big time, Gloria.
You're not a homemaker anymore.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.761
I need you baking cookies,

01:34.845 --> 01:37.806
fluffing pillows,
being bright and cheery for our guests.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.058
Son of a preacher man!

01:40.142 --> 01:42.311
Someone stole our sign again!

01:42.561 --> 01:45.689
What kind of sick mind messes
with a man's livelihood?

01:45.689 --> 01:47.482
You're kidding. Another one?

01:47.566 --> 01:48.901
I'm afraid so, Lindsay.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.360
Who keeps taking our signs?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.487
Don't worry, Sam. We're going to find out.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.782
Miss, do you have any enemies?
Are you in a blood feud?

01:55.866 --> 01:56.867
Gloria...

01:56.867 --> 01:59.244
Have you recently joined
a political opposition?

01:59.328 --> 02:01.997
If... If I may... Lindsay,
we're going to get you a new sign,

02:01.997 --> 02:04.958
uh, find out who's doing this,
and put a stop to it.

02:05.042 --> 02:09.087
Okay, G, time to let you in
on the dark underbelly of our business.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.758
Someone is trying
to take money from my pockets,

02:12.758 --> 02:14.009
and I need to find out who.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.470
Do you need me to go
and shake some trees for you?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.013
I did that kind of job in Colombia.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.724
I didn't get paid,
but I got great references,

02:20.724 --> 02:22.559
and my cousin got to keep one ear.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.769
Oh. I...

02:23.769 --> 02:25.020
- I'll handle it.
- Okay.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.356
But I do need you
to replace that sign ASAP.

02:27.356 --> 02:29.816
A post without a sign is so humiliating.

02:29.900 --> 02:34.321
- Oh. Did it sell?
- No! This is anarchy!

02:34.321 --> 02:35.447
Oh.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.907
Keep going!

02:37.199 --> 02:39.117
My internship with Phil is almost over.

02:39.201 --> 02:42.079
He said that he would hire me
full-time if I did good.

02:42.079 --> 02:46.416
So I need to find who is stealing
his signs to prove my worth.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.460
Luckily, I have a plan.

02:48.544 --> 02:49.545
A couple of weeks ago,

02:49.545 --> 02:52.965
<i>Jay put a tracker thingy
on Stella because</i><i>she kept getting out.</i>

02:52.965 --> 02:55.717
She was down the block,
mooning over that Chihuahua again.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.177
I mean, what does she see in him?

02:57.261 --> 03:00.722
He thinks he's so cool with that dumb
handkerchief around his neck.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.391
I'm going to steal Stella's tracker,

03:02.391 --> 03:05.519
and I'm gonna hide it
on the sign to catch the crook.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.937
And then maybe Stella will get

03:06.937 --> 03:09.398
some alone time with her Chihuahua.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.358
With that pushed-in face,

03:11.358 --> 03:13.986
she could do a lot worse
than a Latin lover.

03:13.986 --> 03:16.697
Here you go, Ms. Dunphy.
Nice and hot, like you like it.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.906
Mmm.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.867
He's nice and hot, like I like it.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.951
- Wow!
- Mom!

03:20.951 --> 03:22.077
No, it's cool.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.871
Time's up for dudes, not us.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.455
I mean, how great is this?

03:25.539 --> 03:28.834
The Dunphy ladies crushing life,
having it all.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.253
Okay, take it down a notch.
We know what you're doing.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.881
My mom was trying to show us
how great it is to be a working woman

03:33.881 --> 03:36.550
'cause she knows how torn I am
about leaving my babies.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.179
It's, like, ugh,
it'll break my heart to be away from them,

03:40.179 --> 03:41.805
but, as a feminist,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.932
I want to show those
snarky bitches at the office

03:44.016 --> 03:45.809
how fast my body bounced back.

03:45.893 --> 03:50.355
Mom obviously wants me to take
this big corporate job offer I got,

03:50.439 --> 03:53.025
but they're all so corrupt and mercenary.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.277
I want to use science
to improve the world,

03:55.277 --> 03:56.612
like I did in Antarctica.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.989
Back off, you disgusting snow chicken!

03:58.989 --> 04:00.824
Do not with me!

04:01.200 --> 04:03.744
Alex, Antarctica made you miserable.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.954
And, Haley,
you were really blossoming at work.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.041
And I get it, but I regret
not going back to work sooner.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.584
And I don't want you
to resent your children.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.921
- Like you did?
- As was the fashion at the time.

04:15.881 --> 04:19.301
Work. Everybody needs Claire.
I love it.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.094
Hey, Margaret. What's going on, sweetie?

04:21.178 --> 04:23.388
I'm here with our lawyer.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.391
Apparently, there's been
some kind of a data breach.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.227
She'd like you to swing by.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.937
Well, that's gonna
have to wait till Monday

04:29.937 --> 04:33.440
because I am having lunch
downstairs with my girls.

04:33.524 --> 04:34.816
Uh... <i>- So, you enjoy</i>

04:34.900 --> 04:36.068
your new hummingbird feeder.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.611
I'm loving those pics.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.240
She's a bit of a cautionary tale.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.327
Haley, you have to admit
it feels good to put on nice clothes

04:45.327 --> 04:46.453
and get out in the world

04:46.537 --> 04:49.081
and not have anyone pawing
at your boobs for two seconds.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.707
- Oh, God, yes.
- Huh?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.543
Dylan is really going through something.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.044
I think he might be regressing.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.254
To what?

04:55.254 --> 04:59.049
And, Alex, I know what
that company's offering you.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.968
Doesn't it feel nice to be wanted?

05:00.968 --> 05:04.012
Of course it does,
but I don't want to sell out.

05:04.096 --> 05:08.267
There is nothing wrong
with taking care of Alex first.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.185
Hey, you can save the world
on the weekends

05:10.269 --> 05:12.062
with all the money you're going to make!

05:12.271 --> 05:14.398
<i>She works hard for the money</i>

05:14.398 --> 05:16.108
- Sing it with me.
- We don't know what that is.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.360
<i>So hard for it, honey</i>

05:18.360 --> 05:19.820
Are you making this up?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.238
<i>She works hard for the money</i>

05:21.238 --> 05:22.948
Sorry to interrupt.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.032
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.535
I need to borrow your mom for a bit.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.828
Okay.

05:28.287 --> 05:31.540
So you know how our smart closets
have scanning cameras,

05:31.540 --> 05:33.834
- so people can try on clothes virtually?
- Uh-huh.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.254
Apparently, we have been recording
people without their knowledge

05:37.254 --> 05:38.505
or their clothes.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.090
Oh, my God.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.676
I have one of those closets. Oh!

05:42.676 --> 05:45.220
I talk sexy to the mirror in there.

05:45.304 --> 05:48.515
What if those movies get out?
I can't have my mother seeing them.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.392
- Okay. Hang on.
- Mmm.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.603
Hey, girls, I'm going to be back in a sec.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.230
I'm just going to run upstairs
and sing <i>"Happy Birthday"</i> to Josie.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.857
Just make her day.
Mmm-hmm.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.692
God, work is so rewarding.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.112
I almost forget what her face
looks like when she's telling the truth.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.197
Yeah.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.533
Come on, Manny!
Where the hell is your mother?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.745
That's what you're wearing to my club?

06:09.745 --> 06:13.415
I'm headed right for the spa,
and their robes stink like old rich guys.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.919
Cigars, scotch, and the panicked
sweat of impending irrelevance.

06:16.919 --> 06:19.171
Easy, Hemingway, we earned that smell.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.297
<i>Hola!</i>

06:20.297 --> 06:22.758
Finally she's here!
Hurry! We're gonna be late.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.384
I'm sorry.
I'm only here for few a seconds.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.386
- I have to go back to work.
- Again?

06:26.470 --> 06:28.722
Jay, I finally found a job that I love.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.891
That's why I've been humping my bust.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.976
- Is that the right way...
- No, no, it's not.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.271
I promise you,
I am all yours this afternoon.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.857
- Eh.
- Stella, Mama!

06:38.941 --> 06:41.568
You're gonna take
good care of my boys, right?

06:41.652 --> 06:44.196
You're gonna take good care.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.322
Don't patronize her.

06:45.322 --> 06:49.117
Be a constant presence in her life,
or you'll stoke her abandonment issues.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.162
Gloria's been working a ton,
so I've been picking up the slack at home,

06:52.246 --> 06:56.583
which is fine. It's just...
Even when she's here, she's not here.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.335
Guess what happened today?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.963
So I'm at the park with Joe.
Now you know all the nannies think

07:00.963 --> 07:03.924
that Dakota's mom
and Lucas' dad are twisting the sheets.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.927
Well, this morning, they came together,

07:06.927 --> 07:10.472
sipping coffees, leaning up
against the jungle gym,

07:10.556 --> 07:11.640
giggling like it's nothing.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.892
Now, they had to know
what that looked like.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.854
<i>Ay,</i> my busy little bee.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.398
Tell me when dinner's ready.
You're the best.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.110
Why, yes, Gloria,
this is a new track suit.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.778
Thanks for noticing.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.321
It's not that hard!

07:26.905 --> 07:28.866
It's so hot.
I can't wait to jump in that pool.

07:28.866 --> 07:29.992
I never said I'd get in the pool.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.786
Okay, Lily, stop.
You are an exotic Vietnamese beauty.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.621
Scarlett Johansson
would play you in a movie

07:34.705 --> 07:35.914
until Twitter told her she couldn't.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.541
It doesn't matter
what other people think of us.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.501
- It matters what we think of ourselves.
- Right.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.044
Oh.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.796
Great. It's all gays.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.007
I can do whatever I want.
I'm invisible.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.842
Oh.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.802
I'm okay!

07:49.678 --> 07:51.221
Hey, girl, hey. Hey, girl, hey.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.432
What's going on? I thought you said there
were going to be kids at this party.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.100
No, I said young people.

07:55.184 --> 07:58.103
Look at that pool. It's boy soup.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.189
I like me some eye candy.

08:00.189 --> 08:02.608
Okay, well, we like actual candy, okay?

08:02.608 --> 08:04.026
We can't take our shirts off

08:04.026 --> 08:05.110
- at this smoke show.
- Yeah.

08:05.194 --> 08:08.113
Calm down, you aren't even
close to the oldest ones here.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.239
Look.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.201
Oh, thank God.
Well, I guess that...

08:13.035 --> 08:16.163
Okay, my grandma was right.
I ended up in hell.

08:17.748 --> 08:21.126
I thought about which of my competitors
might want to take me down,

08:21.210 --> 08:23.128
and I kept coming back to one guy.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.464
Gil Thorpe.

08:26.256 --> 08:29.092
A man tells you enough times
he's going to Thorpedo your career,

08:29.176 --> 08:32.095
you start to believe he might
do something Therrible.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.389
Well, not "This" time.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.483
Easy on the pressure there, Albert.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.319
Sorry, it's my first time.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.071
- Dunphy?
- That's right.

08:49.488 --> 08:50.531
Oh, look at you.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.574
Landed on your feet
after the real estate business

08:52.658 --> 08:54.034
chewed you up and spit you out.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.870
It didn't spit me out.
I'm here to scare you!

08:56.954 --> 08:59.706
- By Sweeney Todd-ing me?
- Don't emasculate my move!

08:59.790 --> 09:02.584
I'm Celie from <i>The Color Purple!</i>
Now, stay still.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.630
I'd hate for you to lose your head,
like I lost my sign...

09:06.630 --> 09:08.340
Son of a... I dropped it.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.800
Where's the blue stuff?

09:10.843 --> 09:12.427
Just admit it.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.680
You've been taking
the signs off my house on Sycamore.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.598
Phil, I'm gay now.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.559
Between pumping' iron
and bummin' out my dad,

09:18.559 --> 09:20.519
I don't have time for our petty rivalry.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.896
But if you ask me,

09:23.897 --> 09:25.774
this stunt's got
Sue Liu written all over it.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.110
Sue Liu.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.946
Are you done? I have a showing at 10:00.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.824
- Hello, Sue Liu.
- Phil?

09:34.491 --> 09:37.369
- So glad you landed on your feet...
- I'm still a realtor!

09:40.372 --> 09:42.374
Son of a bitch, can one thing go my way?

09:42.374 --> 09:43.500
Penny for your thoughts?

09:43.584 --> 09:45.335
Why? Just be my penny, anyway.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.672
Obviously, you're hurt
because Mom's been neglecting you lately.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.340
- Can I give you a little advice?
- Nope.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.092
- Please don't ice her.
- I'm gonna ice her.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.803
Jay, you're just going to make
things worse if you act like a child.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.471
Hey, I'm a child.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.599
That triggers me and hurts my feelings.

09:58.599 --> 10:02.978
Damn hippy private school.
Who's gonna fight the wars, guys? Who?

10:02.978 --> 10:06.356
Rather than push Mom away,
give her a reason to come home.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.901
For years, women have been
waiting at the door for their husbands,

10:08.901 --> 10:11.945
martini in hand,
wearing nothing but Saran wrap.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.071
Maybe it's your turn.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.698
You don't want to see this in Saran wrap.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.200
It's a metaphor.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.037
Come on, do something sweet,
and I bet the whole thing turns around.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.623
Who knows better
how to love my mother, me or you?

10:23.040 --> 10:24.875
You better get a job
with mental health benefits

10:24.875 --> 10:26.376
before all that bubbles up.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.754
So what is our legal liability?

10:30.422 --> 10:31.423
Oh, me?

10:31.507 --> 10:33.175
- You're our lawyer, right?
- Right.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.510
Well, still getting updates,

10:34.510 --> 10:37.554
but, so far, we know the Peeping Toms
were a couple of our engineers.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.056
Whatever happened to the good old days

10:39.056 --> 10:41.058
when people just drilled
a hole in the wall?

10:41.058 --> 10:42.434
That's the stand you wanna take?

10:43.185 --> 10:46.021
We can keep this contained, right?
I mean, our fingerprints aren't on it.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.106
I'm super sorry to do this, but...

10:48.190 --> 10:49.608
Activate closet.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.443
<i>Hello, there.</i>

10:51.527 --> 10:53.570
<i>Are you ready to get undressed?</i>

10:53.654 --> 10:55.113
Why did I agree to do that?

10:55.197 --> 10:58.825
<i>Stand at the mirror
and turn around</i><i>so I can assess your body.</i>

10:58.909 --> 11:02.329
I'm basically a porn director.
What do we do?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.165
Oh, me again?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.292
Um, gosh, I don't know.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.878
They don't teach you this at Harvard,
or where I went.

11:09.962 --> 11:10.963
Mom?

11:10.963 --> 11:13.507
<i>...birthday to you</i>

11:13.507 --> 11:15.300
No luck getting people to sing
with you today, huh?

11:15.384 --> 11:16.635
Are you okay?

11:16.635 --> 11:18.345
- You seemed stressed when you left.
- I'm fine.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.513
Oh, no!

11:19.513 --> 11:20.639
Not now.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.057
The server
with the dirty pictures got hacked!

11:22.057 --> 11:23.892
They could be anywhere! This is so bad!

11:24.643 --> 11:26.061
Oh, me "not now."

11:26.061 --> 11:28.897
Hacked dirty pictures?
Mom, what is going on?

11:28.981 --> 11:30.816
Uh, don't answer that.
She could be wearing a wire.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.109
Oh, no, it's just a bad bra.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.443
Oh, my God,

11:33.527 --> 11:36.196
the pictures from our closets
are all over a Russian porn site!

11:36.280 --> 11:38.824
Oh, geez.
My mother doesn't know I have a tattoo!

11:38.824 --> 11:40.492
I knew I shouldn't've taken
a corporate job!

11:40.576 --> 11:42.119
Why didn't I stay home with my babies?

11:44.329 --> 11:45.747
Yeah, you were a bad hire.

11:46.874 --> 11:50.711
Okay, well, why don't we just tell Lily
one of us isn't feeling well and leave?

11:50.711 --> 11:52.421
We can't! We just took a giant stand

11:52.421 --> 11:54.089
- about loving our hideous bodies.
- Ugh.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.216
- Dads! Get in the pool!
- Yep?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.718
Oh, God. She's making people look at us.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.344
- Okay, yeah, maybe in a sec!
- Yeah.

12:00.596 --> 12:01.889
Okay, we have to hide from her.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.974
You have to admit,
the irony of this is delicious.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.977
Yeah, well, look at us, apparently,
we think everything is delicious.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.188
I'm ashamed of how ashamed we are.

12:09.188 --> 12:11.648
What other grown men
would be so consumed by their own vanity?

12:12.858 --> 12:15.319
Close the door! They can smell the decay!

12:15.319 --> 12:17.446
It's just Mitch and Cam.

12:17.446 --> 12:19.448
We were afraid you were
one of the beautiful boys.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.074
Please, I've never felt so hairy.

12:21.158 --> 12:24.119
Get in line,
this queen only has one trimmer.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.496
Okay, how horrible is this party?

12:26.580 --> 12:30.250
I'm a skinny little girl with twig arms.
It's all anyone's talking about.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.835
I told some twink by the crudite

12:31.919 --> 12:33.754
that I was swollen
from a kidney transplant.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.963
Well, then you have an excuse.

12:35.047 --> 12:36.173
Let me on that elliptical!

12:36.173 --> 12:38.800
I haven't felt this white
since I loved the movie <i>Green Book...</i>

12:38.884 --> 12:40.010
All right, bronzer me!

12:40.010 --> 12:42.304
And I don't want you to be stingy.
I want it everywhere.

12:42.304 --> 12:43.639
Everywhere!

12:45.891 --> 12:50.354
<i>I replaced the sign and attached
Stella's GPS tracker to the back.</i>

12:50.354 --> 12:52.773
<i>And then I headed home to Jay.</i>

12:54.441 --> 12:56.693
<i>- Hello!</i>
- Hey, honey. You get my text?

12:56.902 --> 13:00.531
I did. An eggplant and a peach emoji.

13:00.531 --> 13:02.533
Does that mean what I think it means?

13:02.533 --> 13:06.078
You bet. I ordered eggplant
parmesan and peach cobbler.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.372
Yum! I'll be home in a few minutes.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.249
<i>- Ay!</i>

13:10.415 --> 13:13.961
<i>- What?</i>
- Uh, nothing. I have a flat tire.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.046
I'm gonna call AA to get it fixed.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.840
No, AAA fixes tires.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.552
AA is that alcoholic cult
that makes your friends no fun anymore.

13:21.552 --> 13:22.886
I'll come fix the tire.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.263
No, no, no. I'll do it.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.139
This is another work thing, isn't it?

13:26.223 --> 13:29.184
I am losing you. I am in a tunnel.

13:29.268 --> 13:30.727
There's no tunnels!

13:32.271 --> 13:35.315
I can't believe I even
considered that for you!

13:35.399 --> 13:39.069
Alls I'm saying is,
the other families had alibis,

13:39.069 --> 13:42.656
and you wouldn't be
the first mother-son crime duo in history.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.784
I told you, Phil,
we didn't steal your sign.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.411
We slept in this morning.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.830
Mother and I went clubbing last night.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.749
We went looking for a husband,
but lost ourselves on the dance floor.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.252
Nice try, but I'm not buying
what you're selling.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.461
Confess!

13:56.545 --> 13:58.088
I can do this all day or...

14:00.007 --> 14:01.675
Six more times!

14:01.675 --> 14:04.761
Phil! I'm tracking the thief
that stole our sign!

14:04.845 --> 14:06.305
Hurry! He's getting away!

14:08.724 --> 14:12.019
I guess this new information
bursts my balloon.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.187
I bid you good day.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.440
Well, somebody should enjoy this.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.192
- I'm hungry.
- Stella!

14:20.319 --> 14:23.363
She's probably down the street,
playing with that greasy Chihuahua.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.448
Where did I go wrong?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.408
Why doesn't she know she deserves better?

14:26.408 --> 14:27.910
I think I have some
old cheese puffs in my room.

14:28.994 --> 14:31.413
Damn it, how'd you get
all the way across town?

14:31.413 --> 14:32.789
I'm coming, baby!

14:33.123 --> 14:34.124
I'm coming!

14:40.255 --> 14:42.090
Hey, Jay... Eh.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.179
Alex, what are you doing?

14:47.179 --> 14:50.474
Turning down this job
before corporate evil corrodes my insides.

14:50.474 --> 14:54.061
And I am not leaving my babies so that
I can be this stressed and miserable.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.145
I'm going to jail!

14:55.229 --> 14:57.397
I signed things without reading them!
What if I helped the pervs?

14:57.481 --> 14:58.941
What if I put the gun in their hand?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.400
Doesn't sound like
it was a gun in their hand.

15:00.484 --> 15:01.902
Solid.

15:01.902 --> 15:05.155
Well, it's been a great 40 years.

15:05.239 --> 15:08.575
In the words of my tattoo, "Peace out."

15:09.701 --> 15:10.702
Well...

15:10.911 --> 15:11.912
Margaret!

15:12.246 --> 15:14.873
Oh, it's okay.
I don't work here anymore.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.750
- Yeah, I'm out too.
- Yeah, I'm not going down with this ship.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.001
No, no, no. Stop. No one's leaving.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.920
We're not going to let one little misstep

15:19.920 --> 15:23.090
make us forget everything
this company has given us!

15:23.090 --> 15:25.801
I loved being a stay-at-home mom. I did.

15:25.801 --> 15:29.429
But working here has given me
a whole new sense of self.

15:29.847 --> 15:32.933
And, come on,
one mistake doesn't make us evil.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.309
We will come clean.

15:34.393 --> 15:37.187
We'll recall the product.
We'll do whatever we have to do.

15:37.271 --> 15:41.859
Because under this tech BS,
there is a company we love.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.945
Look, we may no longer make smart closets,

15:44.945 --> 15:48.073
but we're sure as hell
going to make smart closets.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.241
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

15:49.241 --> 15:51.285
<i>Looking for a smart outfit?</i>

15:51.285 --> 15:55.038
<i>Maintain eye contact
with the mirror</i><i>and begin stripping down.</i>

15:55.539 --> 15:56.999
I deeply regret that.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.296
<i>Approaching Stella.</i>

16:02.296 --> 16:04.006
Look! That's him! On the bike!

16:04.006 --> 16:05.090
He's going off-road!

16:05.174 --> 16:08.010
Don't worry.
I'm gonna catch this guy or die trying!

16:08.010 --> 16:09.303
I love your enthusiasm.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.597
One note, and this might be
a second language thing,

16:11.597 --> 16:12.848
but when you say "die"...

16:12.848 --> 16:15.350
No, no, no! He's getting away!

16:18.103 --> 16:19.271
Freeze!

16:19.897 --> 16:20.898
Jay?

16:21.732 --> 16:23.984
What a ray of light in a dark time.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.028
Shut up, Phil. Where's my dog?

16:26.028 --> 16:28.363
And what are you doing here?
I thought you had a flat tire.

16:28.447 --> 16:32.117
I had to catch the thief
that was stealing Phil's signs,

16:32.201 --> 16:34.912
so I put Stella's tracking thing on it.

16:34.912 --> 16:38.332
What? What if she's down the street
with that over-sexed Chihuahua?

16:38.332 --> 16:41.502
Jay, she needs it,
and you can't be her everything!

16:41.502 --> 16:44.296
Turn around, punk!
I want to see your face!

16:46.048 --> 16:47.049
Sam?

16:47.049 --> 16:49.760
Why are you stealing signs
from your own house?

16:50.093 --> 16:51.094
Oh.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.138
You don't want to move.

16:53.222 --> 16:54.765
I don't want to leave my friends.

16:55.057 --> 16:58.435
I get it. Change is hard.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.063
When I moved to this country,
it was change.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.608
When I got married and moved
to a mainly white neighborhood

17:04.608 --> 17:08.987
with kind of racist lawn statues,
that was change.

17:09.071 --> 17:13.575
But we get to meet new people,
and we get to do new things that we love.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.911
Twelve years ago,
I didn't know these people,

17:15.911 --> 17:18.455
and now, I would kill for them.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.415
You will find people like that, too.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.251
- I hope you're right.
- I am.

17:22.251 --> 17:23.335
So, now, let's go.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.337
Put that bike in my car,
and I'll drive you home.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.717
Gloria, that was so terrific.

17:30.801 --> 17:35.430
I know! I am wonderful!
Why don't you want to hire me?

17:35.514 --> 17:38.016
Because I was worried that
it was a hobby to you,

17:38.100 --> 17:41.812
something to do till you got bored, but,
today, you really showed me something.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.480
- You're giving me the job?
- Yeah.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.900
This means that I'm gonna
have to work more...

17:46.984 --> 17:49.987
It's fine. If Sam can handle change,
so can I.

17:49.987 --> 17:53.115
Welcome to Dunphy Realty, Ms. Delgado.

17:53.115 --> 17:56.994
Delgado? That's your working name?
Man, the hits just keep coming.

17:57.995 --> 18:00.664
Okay. Before I do more,
does this look natural?

18:00.664 --> 18:04.126
That's a tricky word because the color
orange does appear in nature.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.128
Well, there you all are!

18:06.128 --> 18:09.173
Look, I love you, but you are literally
the only six people here

18:09.173 --> 18:10.674
I don't want in my bedroom.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.302
Thanks. We weren't feeling
insecure enough already.

18:13.302 --> 18:14.636
You know what I think?

18:14.720 --> 18:19.600
You only invited us because we make you
look like the hot old guy.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.684
Old guy? I'm not old!

18:20.684 --> 18:22.686
Oh, please,
hide that hairline all you want,

18:22.686 --> 18:25.898
we know what year you danced
on that Paula Abdul tour,

18:25.898 --> 18:27.024
and so do they.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.483
Oh, my God.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.653
I'm making a fool out of myself, aren't I?
Straight up, now tell me...

18:31.737 --> 18:33.655
Hi, honey.
Lily?

18:33.739 --> 18:35.199
- Hey, girl, hey.
- I knew it.

18:35.199 --> 18:36.283
You're hiding.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.493
- No. They are.
- No. No. They are, but we're not. No.

18:38.577 --> 18:40.913
So I'm supposed to love who I am,
but you guys don't?

18:40.913 --> 18:42.039
Hypocrites.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.250
Tough love time?

18:45.334 --> 18:47.544
We dig her. It comes off a little mean.

18:47.628 --> 18:49.379
She's not mean. She's right!

18:49.463 --> 18:52.007
I mean, why are we so obsessed
with how we look?

18:52.007 --> 18:53.800
So people will have sex with us?

18:53.884 --> 18:56.512
But confidence is the sexiest thing.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.180
That sounds stupid, doesn't it?

18:58.180 --> 19:00.516
I'm sorry. Look at someone else!

19:00.516 --> 19:03.685
Okay, but you know what?
Confidence is the most important thing,

19:03.769 --> 19:05.812
and, look, maybe we've lost
a little of our beauty,

19:05.896 --> 19:07.397
but we have a lot to be proud of.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.399
I'm a vice-principal. I'm a dad.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.818
I'm the city's first
openly-gay football coach.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.612
And... And I'm a state prosecutor.

19:13.612 --> 19:16.448
Ronaldo has a business and a family.

19:16.532 --> 19:17.824
And Bobby...

19:17.908 --> 19:22.037
I mean, sure, his career is not on fire,
but he looks great, and he's 50.

19:22.037 --> 19:24.873
I'm 37, you wicked old witch!

19:25.123 --> 19:26.959
I hear what you're saying,
but the point...

19:26.959 --> 19:30.546
Hey! The point is, at our age,

19:30.546 --> 19:34.466
we have earned the right to be
comfortable with who we are.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.260
Now, let's get out there,

19:36.260 --> 19:40.180
set good examples for our children
and our overly pampered pets!

19:41.306 --> 19:42.891
You with me?

20:14.590 --> 20:16.091
Whoo-hoo!

20:18.260 --> 20:19.511
<i>The older we get,</i>

20:19.595 --> 20:21.930
<i>the harder it is to keep up
with life's changes.</i>

20:22.890 --> 20:27.436
<i>We hold on to who we once were,
like it's the only way</i><i>we can be happy.</i>

20:30.814 --> 20:32.858
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

20:32.858 --> 20:35.819
<i>But there are huge
rewards when we take risks,</i>

20:35.903 --> 20:37.487
<i>embrace new experiences...</i>

20:38.155 --> 20:39.907
I am a proud middle-aged man.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.241
This is what I look like,

20:41.325 --> 20:42.743
and I think I look sexy...

20:45.871 --> 20:48.123
Am I literally invisible to you people?

20:50.792 --> 20:52.961
You know, I'm so proud of us.

20:53.045 --> 20:54.338
We overcame a lot today.

20:54.338 --> 20:56.673
Yeah, you know, I feel so much
lighter without all that shame.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.133
Although I guess it wouldn't hurt us

20:58.217 --> 20:59.801
if we were actually lighter.

20:59.885 --> 21:03.222
Yeah, I mean, we could exercise
more and both eat better.

21:03.222 --> 21:05.849
It would help if we got rid of
some of these temptations, you know?

21:05.933 --> 21:08.185
We don't need three
different kinds of pasta.

21:08.185 --> 21:11.772
Right. And parmesan cheese,
heavy cream...

21:11.772 --> 21:13.857
It's just empty calories and fat.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.570
We're totally making fettuccini alfredo,
aren't we?

21:18.654 --> 21:20.280
Damn straight. We don't have
another pool party for months.

21:20.364 --> 21:21.865
- I'll salt the water.
- I'm gonna get wine.
