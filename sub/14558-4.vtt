WEBVTT

00:09.643 --> 00:12.646
(dance music playing)

00:16.917 --> 00:20.054
* *

00:38.839 --> 00:41.809
* *

00:46.247 --> 00:49.350
* *

01:03.831 --> 01:07.168
(tires squealing)

01:17.145 --> 01:18.446
COLBY:
Victim's Michelle Kim.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.747
She used to
look like that.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.850
What's the deal?
Why can't LAPD handle this?

01:22.916 --> 01:25.919
Uh, she used to work for
the Chinese Consulate.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.188
You know how
those guys are--

01:27.255 --> 01:28.689
15 minutes after they
find out she's dead,

01:28.756 --> 01:30.057
they'll have her
apartment cleared out.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.592
What did she do
for the consulate?

01:31.659 --> 01:32.760
Interpreter.

01:32.826 --> 01:33.794
Witnesses?

01:33.861 --> 01:36.997
Yeah. It's a hit and
run. Some say Tahoe,

01:37.064 --> 01:38.232
some say Explorer.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.600
No way to know for sure.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.502
There's got to be at least
a dozen bars

01:41.569 --> 01:45.873
in the area-- figure a D-U-I
hits her, panics, takes off.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.509
No skid marks.

01:48.576 --> 01:49.743
Nope.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.745
Any damage to these cars?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.147
No.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.249
Lucky drunk.

01:55.316 --> 01:58.719
Yeah, tell her that.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.590
Mmm.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.462
You know, they say
there's nothing sexier

02:08.529 --> 02:10.398
than a man who knows
how to cook.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.700
Well, what do you say,
you agree?

02:12.766 --> 02:13.601
I don't know.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.102
I like guys who are
good at math.

02:15.169 --> 02:20.040
Aw. Well, actually I'm using
differential geometry

02:20.107 --> 02:21.742
to perfect
the chocolate chip cookie.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.212
That's right.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.479
What, is this in case the whole

02:25.546 --> 02:26.614
math genius thing
doesn't work out?

02:26.680 --> 02:28.482
-It's for Senior Ditch Day.
-Hmm.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.883
You mean Senior Beach Day.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.885
Yeah, when they're away,
the underclassmen will play.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.454
Remember, last year,
they ransacked my office.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.989
-Yeah, so this year...
-This year, I leave a peace

02:36.056 --> 02:37.458
offering for the hungry natives.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.959
Hmm, needs bigger chips.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.828
So...
(clears throat)

02:40.894 --> 02:43.731
I guess congratulations
are in order.

02:43.797 --> 02:44.865
For?

02:44.932 --> 02:48.436
It's a bit controversial,
but I like it.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.937
I mean, Larry used

02:50.003 --> 02:52.240
a non-standard analysis
instead of the conventional

02:52.306 --> 02:54.975
Borel approach in treating
the singularities.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.344
Can I... just... (stammers)

03:00.047 --> 03:03.284
So Larry published an article...

03:04.652 --> 03:07.755
on zero point energy and quan...

03:07.821 --> 03:12.025
and quantum cosmology.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.627
You didn't know?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.063
Well, I thought
he would have

03:16.129 --> 03:17.565
asked you to collaborate.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.899
Me, too.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.404
Coroner found paint chips
under her skin.

03:23.471 --> 03:26.240
Color traces back
to the Ford Motor Company.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.508
They have a model yet?

03:27.575 --> 03:29.343
Either Explorer
or a Jaguar.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.811
Better notify the locals.

03:30.878 --> 03:31.879
If that SUV was stolen,

03:31.945 --> 03:34.382
it's gonna be headed straight
to a chop shop.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.649
Looks like Michelle Kim moved

03:35.716 --> 03:37.885
back and forth between here
and China growing up.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.653
We got a file on her?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.390
Yeah, this is Granger,
FBI, for Jackson.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.524
No, but we have on her father.

03:43.591 --> 03:46.193
Okay, just have him
return it, thank you.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.729
Former Chinese diplomat.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.631
Retired in '97.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.734
FBI Counter Intelligence
ran a background check

03:53.801 --> 03:56.103
on her when she moved back
into the country in '03.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.272
Counter Intelligence?
Why were they looking at her?

03:58.339 --> 03:59.239
I don't know.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.541
Whoa, whoa,
wait a second.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.343
Scroll back down there.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.346
Right there.
That background check

04:05.413 --> 04:07.315
was filed by an old Army buddy
of mine.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.317
-Dwayne Carter.
-Yeah.

04:09.383 --> 04:12.320
Carter and I did a tour
together in Afghanistan.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.887
You guys still tight?

04:13.954 --> 04:16.690
I've called him a few times,
but he hasn't been around.

04:18.058 --> 04:18.992
(exhales)

04:19.059 --> 04:21.995
That guy saved my ass.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.431
No way.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.032
Yeah, we were in this Humvee
together,

04:25.098 --> 04:29.837
got hit by an RPG and the thing
just exploded into flames.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.539
I got trapped,
had this piece of metal

04:31.605 --> 04:33.173
just wrapped
around my arm.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.842
Thought for sure

04:34.908 --> 04:36.777
my ticket was punched.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.848
Dwayne, he just... jumped in,
man, ripped me out of there

04:40.914 --> 04:46.053
and the dumb bastard, he got
third-degree burns on his hand.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.721
Sounds like the guy to talk to.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.728
DON:
Hey, what are you doing here?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.697
Oh, I'm just gathering
some information for a paper

04:56.764 --> 04:58.499
that Larry's
working on.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.401
Hey, you know, you guys
have direct access

05:00.468 --> 05:01.702
through NASA's firewall.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.037
That's right.
Big Brother's always watching.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.105
Hey, is this a new case?

05:05.172 --> 05:07.641
Yeah, it's a hit and run,
but I don't know,

05:07.708 --> 05:09.543
I'm thinking it's looking
like something more.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.078
Something more
like what?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.146
-Well, like it's intentional.
-Okay, you want me

05:13.213 --> 05:14.948
-to take a look at it?
-No, that's all right.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.451
-Don't worry about it.
-Because, you know, I-I...

05:17.518 --> 05:18.819
I can factor in steady
motion regimes--

05:18.886 --> 05:21.021
you know, body stiffness
coefficients,

05:21.088 --> 05:22.356
and not to mention, you know,

05:22.423 --> 05:23.591
subtle body undulations
generated

05:23.657 --> 05:25.626
-by the ground-reaction force.
-You got me there.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.727
-Go for it.
-Because, you know,

05:26.794 --> 05:28.462
was she walking,
was she standing still?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.230
-I don't know.
-How fast was she moving?

05:30.297 --> 05:31.765
Once you have
that data,

05:31.832 --> 05:33.066
these impact marks
can tell you a whole lot.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.802
-This is no problem for me
to work... -Knock yourself out.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.303
I'll have an answer for you
as soon as I can.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.738
You're the one who's always
saying you're overworked.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.674
Hey. How'd it go
at Kim's place?

05:40.741 --> 05:42.776
I spoke to a couple
of the neighbors.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.713
She was quiet, kept to
herself, no boyfriend.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.180
What, you don't buy it?

05:47.247 --> 05:48.616
She's 24 years old.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.853
Her last stop was one of
the hottest nightclubs in L.A.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.021
I have my doubts.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.524
Bartender remembers her getting
a call right before she left.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.325
-Oh, yeah?
Did it trace anywhere? -Didn't.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.093
Call came
from a prepaid cell phone.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.497
Techs just lifted Kim's online
bank account records.

06:03.564 --> 06:07.000
Got over a hundred grand
in all-cash deposits.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.270
Well, the Chinese pay their
interpreters really well.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.472
We got untraceable
cell phones,

06:11.539 --> 06:13.507
cash deposits.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.942
What was this girl into?

06:22.816 --> 06:26.420
Since when is the FBI interested
in zero point energy?

06:26.487 --> 06:27.421
Huh? Uh...

06:27.488 --> 06:28.422
Are you checking

06:28.489 --> 06:29.557
Larry's work, Charlie?

06:29.623 --> 06:30.558
I'm just looking--

06:30.624 --> 06:31.725
just taking a look at it.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.427
Did he ask you to do that?

06:33.494 --> 06:34.695
No, no.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.431
What he's done
is fairly impressive.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.600
Oh, "fairly impressive."

06:39.667 --> 06:41.435
Well, you know what I mean.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.270
No.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.672
What do you mean?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.907
Nothing. It has, it has
great potential.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.776
Yeah, but it needs
your assistance.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.279
To be honest with you...
yeah.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.280
Yes.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.414
Mm-hmm.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.616
Charlie, did you ever think that

06:55.683 --> 06:56.817
maybe Larry doesn't want you...

06:56.884 --> 06:58.218
Why wouldn't Larry want my help?

06:58.285 --> 07:02.590
I don't know, but he sure
didn't ask for it, did he?

07:04.558 --> 07:05.826
(elevator bell dings)

07:08.295 --> 07:11.899
PFC Granger, you son of a gun!

07:11.965 --> 07:13.534
(laughing)

07:13.601 --> 07:15.435
-Man.
-What's up?

07:15.503 --> 07:17.838
I practically had to put you
under surveillance to find you.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.339
Yeah, if I was easy
to locate,

07:19.406 --> 07:21.609
I wouldn't be in Counter
Intelligence now, would I?

07:21.675 --> 07:23.611
What's up?

07:23.677 --> 07:26.413
Well, I caught this case--
Michelle Kim--

07:26.480 --> 07:27.748
worked for the Chinese.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.082
Yeah, they said
somebody was coming up

07:29.149 --> 07:31.685
to talk to me, so I took a look
at my report-- wasn't much.

07:31.752 --> 07:32.920
Any reason you guys

07:32.986 --> 07:34.488
were looking into her
to begin with?

07:34.555 --> 07:35.623
Immigration flagged her.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.625
She entered the country
with two passports,

07:37.691 --> 07:39.527
parents both Chinese nationals.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.028
Post 9-11. Thought was,
we had to know

07:41.094 --> 07:42.730
what she'd been
up to on the mainland.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.398
-And? -She'd been
in Beijing at university;

07:45.465 --> 07:47.100
she came back to take a job

07:47.167 --> 07:49.269
with the Chinese Consulate
as an interpreter.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.739
Everything seemed
on the up and up.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.441
Why? You got
something different?

07:54.508 --> 07:56.910
She died last night.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.913
-Died?
-Yeah. Hit and run.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.249
Maybe more. That's why
I want to talk to you.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.651
Yeah, I don't know.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.919
Uh, I'll ask around.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.955
-See what I can dig up.
-Okay.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.991
How you doing?

08:11.058 --> 08:13.026
Adjusting. You?

08:13.093 --> 08:14.862
Yeah, the same, I guess.

08:14.928 --> 08:19.533
Never really
goes away, does it?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.401
No, never does.

08:21.468 --> 08:25.472
Al right, you catch something,
give me a call, all right?

08:25.539 --> 08:27.407
Absolutely.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.342
Come here! Come here!

08:29.409 --> 08:30.343
(laughing)

08:30.410 --> 08:31.511
It's great to see you.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.746
You, too.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.087
(clears throat)

08:40.153 --> 08:41.622
Ah, Charles.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.191
Say, did you know that
an Oort cloud has a mass

08:44.257 --> 08:47.961
somewhere between five and a
hundred times that of the Earth?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.831
Oort cloud? Cloud
that spits out comets?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.766
Oh, yeah.
Thousands of comets.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.302
-You know, I had, I had no idea.
-Yeah.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.972
So, I've, uh, come by here
to congratulate you

08:59.039 --> 09:01.341
-on your paper.
-Well, that was nothing.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.910
Nothing. Well, what you did,

09:02.976 --> 09:05.112
analyzing the effective
weight of zero point energy

09:05.178 --> 09:06.546
in a nonstandard way,

09:06.614 --> 09:08.115
well, that-that could lead
to a solution

09:08.181 --> 09:10.918
-for the cosmological constant
problem, right? -Yeah.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.452
Well, I mean,
The Uncertainty Principle

09:12.519 --> 09:13.654
of Quantum Mechanics
does say that

09:13.721 --> 09:16.256
there must be
some virtual mass, so...

09:16.323 --> 09:18.592
-I'm sorry, I'm running late
here. -Oh, I'm , I'm curious.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.528
Um, who collaborated with you
on the math?

09:21.595 --> 09:22.896
Uh, Brian Stromsborg.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.564
-Oh, Stromsborg's good.
-Yeah, he is.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.599
He is good.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.000
Yeah, he's good.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.335
Uh, now, I'm sensing that

09:28.401 --> 09:31.705
there might be something more
involved here than well wishes.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.441
Oh... did you forget
where my office was?

09:34.507 --> 09:35.709
No! No!

09:35.776 --> 09:39.579
Stromsborg has so much
experience in this field.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.580
Yeah, I know, I know.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.215
Yeah, but...?

09:42.282 --> 09:43.784
I'm so used to you
coming to see me.

09:43.851 --> 09:47.220
Perhaps I was getting
a little too used to it myself.

09:47.287 --> 09:51.158
Well, Larry, you know, I hope
I've never made you feel like...

09:51.224 --> 09:52.660
No, absolutely not.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.094
No, I just,
I feel of late

09:54.161 --> 09:56.764
just a need to do some
branching out, that's all.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.198
Branching out?

10:00.167 --> 10:03.370
Yeah, well, I'm maybe like
a comet trying to break out

10:03.436 --> 10:05.538
of its orbit, uh...

10:05.605 --> 10:08.809
find my own escape trajectory,

10:08.876 --> 10:11.178
just come into my own entity,
I don't know.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.913
I'm so sorry, I'm running late,

10:12.980 --> 10:15.382
but, Charles,
I think I just need

10:15.448 --> 10:18.251
to stretch myself a little,
that's all.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.320
Pure and simple.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.524
I've been cleared
by my ambassador

10:24.591 --> 10:25.659
to cooperate
in any way.

10:25.726 --> 10:29.062
I've also notified Miss
Kim's parents in Beijing.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.800
You can imagine how difficult
a call that was to make.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.868
I hope you expressed
our sympathies.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.671
To have a child taken from you
at such great distance...

10:37.738 --> 10:42.676
But I suppose a traffic accident
can occur anywhere in the world.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.944
Well, we're not so sure

10:44.011 --> 10:46.279
-it was an accident.
-I don't understand.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.482
-Well, her job was an
interpreter? -That's right.

10:49.549 --> 10:52.019
Any reason she'd have large sums
of cash in her bank account?

10:52.085 --> 10:55.188
Her personal finances
wouldn't be something

10:55.255 --> 10:56.757
I would have
any knowledge about.

10:56.824 --> 10:57.657
So that would be a "no"?

10:57.725 --> 11:00.560
I'm afraid I didn't really
know her very well.

11:00.627 --> 11:01.862
Well, we'd like to take a look

11:01.929 --> 11:03.396
at a list of people
she worked with.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.767
I'll speak with the ambassador,
see what I can do.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.136
Thanks.
Appreciate that.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.172
DAVID: What'd the Consulate
General have to say?

11:12.239 --> 11:15.108
That he knew her less
and less as we stood there.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.609
Well, either he's telling
the truth

11:16.676 --> 11:20.613
or the Chinese have
a very liberal hiring policy.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.915
Why?

11:21.982 --> 11:24.952
Credit card has a bunch
of charges to nightspots,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.087
lingerie boutiques

11:27.154 --> 11:28.455
and the occasional adult store.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.723
Which totally contradicts

11:29.790 --> 11:31.391
what the neighbors told me.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.260
Maybe you should run those
through LAPD Vice,

11:33.326 --> 11:34.762
Narco...

11:34.828 --> 11:35.796
You know, we're not even sure

11:35.863 --> 11:36.797
this girl
was actually murdered yet.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.465
Um, yeah,
actually, we are,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.801
As promised, I do have
an answer on whether

11:40.868 --> 11:42.469
or not this
was an accident.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.370
I thought
you had class.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.272
I do. I have lunch and I...
oh, and dinner.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.107
Look, you guys got, like,
sandwiches around here?

11:47.174 --> 11:48.108
We'll order out
for you.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.210
-A nice turkey thing...?
-What do you got?

11:50.277 --> 11:52.980
All right, I tried using
a steady-motion algorithm

11:53.046 --> 11:55.916
to try to determine
the motion of your victim

11:55.983 --> 11:56.984
at the point of impact,

11:57.050 --> 11:58.718
but my results
were inconclusive.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.153
But you persevered.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.221
I did, I did.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.722
You know,
I imagined her walking,

12:02.790 --> 12:04.825
the motion of her feet,

12:04.892 --> 12:09.662
and then it occurred to me--
curtate cycloid.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.098
Oh, curtate cycloid.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.000
-C.C.
-Right, of course.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.904
Think of someone's, uh,
someone's stride

12:16.970 --> 12:18.671
like the Moon orbiting
around the Earth.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.108
As the Moon moves around
the Earth and the Earth moves

12:21.174 --> 12:23.743
around the Sun,
the Moon traces out

12:23.811 --> 12:25.779
a curtate cycloid curve
in space.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.715
In essence, creating a circle
within a bigger circle.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.584
Now, when you walk,
the heel orbiting backward

12:31.651 --> 12:33.586
then forward past the knee,

12:33.653 --> 12:35.288
creates the same pattern
of circles.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.324
Now, from there, I could
probabilistically determine

12:37.390 --> 12:39.960
the leg motion of your victim
at the point of impact.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.729
And that probabilistically
helps us how?

12:42.796 --> 12:46.699
Well, the marks on her legs
that the vehicle's lights made,

12:46.766 --> 12:48.101
they're high.

12:48.168 --> 12:48.768
High?

12:48.836 --> 12:50.770
Yeah, the bumper of the vehicle

12:50.838 --> 12:52.039
was rising on impact.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.441
So what, you're saying
it was accelerating?

12:54.507 --> 12:58.611
Which means this wasn't
an accident.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.213
Oh, no.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.187
Whatcha say, Megan?

13:07.254 --> 13:08.688
Morning.

13:08.755 --> 13:11.191
So, Washington wants us to
handle this on a local level.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.625
How are we doing

13:12.692 --> 13:13.593
on that girl's account?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.528
Not very good. All the deposits
were made in cash

13:15.595 --> 13:18.065
just below the ten grand
reporting minimum.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.499
Yeah? What about Colby's friend?

13:19.566 --> 13:20.700
Uh, Dwayne Carter

13:20.767 --> 13:24.071
said that Kim's background check
was just routine.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.238
A 24-year-old interpreter

13:25.305 --> 13:26.806
with that kind of money
ain't routine.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.942
ERT found this access card

13:29.009 --> 13:31.144
during a daylight sweep
of the crime scene.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.579
Kim's prints
are all over it

13:32.645 --> 13:34.314
and it does not belong
to the Consulate.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.316
Or her apartment.
I used a key found in

13:36.383 --> 13:38.085
her purse when I
went the other night.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.453
-Huh... -We got ERT
running it down right now.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.722
Hey, you guys should have
a look at this.

13:42.789 --> 13:43.756
Techs found something
interesting

13:43.823 --> 13:44.958
on Michelle's laptop.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.231
-Megan said you guys
got something. -Hey.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.032
Yeah.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.066
DAVID:
Michelle Kim's computer.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.902
Seems like she had a thing

13:54.968 --> 13:57.804
for Internet
porn sites.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.539
Um, did she save any
of the images

13:59.606 --> 14:00.607
from this Web site?

14:00.673 --> 14:03.810
Oh, yeah, she's downloaded
quite a few images.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.479
Why? What?

14:06.546 --> 14:09.082
Remember that image of the
little girl we found hidden

14:09.149 --> 14:10.083
in the photograph?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.184
Right, the child porn case.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.219
This is very similar.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.954
It's only a lot more
sophisticated.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.657
This picture is really thousands
of pixels

14:17.724 --> 14:20.327
reproduced as squares.
Now could you please zoom in

14:20.393 --> 14:21.962
on this portion
of the photograph?

14:22.029 --> 14:23.763
MEGAN:
Okay.

14:23.830 --> 14:24.831
That's great.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.333
All right, now remove
some of these squares

14:26.399 --> 14:28.501
and you can still see
the photo.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.570
However, a coded message
can easily be hidden

14:30.637 --> 14:32.472
within this missing information.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.041
Yeah, and?

14:34.107 --> 14:36.143
Well, you know those tests
they give people

14:36.209 --> 14:37.777
for colorblindness,
the green dots?

14:37.844 --> 14:40.680
To someone who's truly
colorblind, all they see

14:40.747 --> 14:42.082
is a bunch of green dots,

14:42.149 --> 14:44.117
but to a person
with perfect vision,

14:44.184 --> 14:46.954
the same exact image reveals
a hidden picture.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.288
So you think you can crack it?

14:48.355 --> 14:51.024
Uh, look, if there's
a message in here,

14:51.091 --> 14:54.561
yeah, then I should be able
to find it.

14:56.496 --> 15:00.000
Yeah, it's a pass card
for the building garage.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.068
Something happen?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.070
You recognize this girl?

15:05.405 --> 15:06.339
15-C.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.409
She had an apartment here?

15:09.476 --> 15:11.979
Yeah. Had?
What's going on here?

15:12.045 --> 15:14.014
She was killed in an accident.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.349
Oh, wow.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.152
That's horrible.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.620
You know how long
she lived here?

15:20.687 --> 15:22.389
Two years, give or take.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.991
She live alone
or with someone?

15:24.057 --> 15:26.393
Uh, alone, I think.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.696
I'd see her come in maybe
one, two nights a week.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.133
You guys keep the tapes
to that camera?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.401
It's all digital.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.836
The footage gets online
to a database somewhere

15:36.903 --> 15:38.538
for insurance
or something.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.453
MEGAN: So, Kim maintained
a second apartment?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.788
DAVID: Yeah, under an alias.
We checked it out.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.191
There's no food in the fridge,
no cable hookups.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.559
What do you think?
A meeting place?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.128
The lobby has
security cameras.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.329
Colby's checking out
the footage right now.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.056
LARRY:
You know, what amazes me here

16:29.122 --> 16:30.623
is that they're hiding
their messages

16:30.690 --> 16:33.326
using the very same
encryption programs

16:33.393 --> 16:35.962
that the privacy groups
hired us to develop.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.564
Back when I was

16:37.630 --> 16:38.498
real little,

16:38.565 --> 16:41.468
I heard that the KGB
and the CIA used to send

16:41.534 --> 16:44.637
these encoded messages
via shortwave radio.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.240
-I thought I was the only one.
-Oh, no, you and me both.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.209
Yeah, I'd be listening
to these people talking

16:49.276 --> 16:51.911
in these languages
I couldn't possibly understand.

16:51.978 --> 16:55.382
I was imagining their operatives
in Paris and Germany.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.218
I even tried sending my own
secret messages in response.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.986
I never thought
about doing that.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.721
Well, the police came
to my house.

17:01.788 --> 17:02.522
The police came?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.291
Yeah, it was some
FCC violation.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.658
I think they
were police.

17:05.725 --> 17:09.062
You know, that reminds me
of that time that we rewired

17:09.129 --> 17:10.730
the P.A. system at Princeton.

17:10.797 --> 17:14.000
Listen, I have to say
it was refreshing to see

17:14.067 --> 17:15.368
your sense
of humor that time.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.837
It really was. Up till then,
I was a little concerned

17:17.904 --> 17:19.939
that your natural intensity
might well be your undoing.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.142
It wasn't just about IQs.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.411
Our working together?

17:24.477 --> 17:26.379
No, no, no.
I knew your sense

17:26.446 --> 17:28.415
of analysis suited my own.

17:28.481 --> 17:32.252
You're making it sound
like, like that's changed.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.453
Charles, let's face it.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.223
Your passion has taken you
down many new roads:

17:36.289 --> 17:38.024
your work with Don,

17:38.091 --> 17:40.360
your convergence theory...

17:42.962 --> 17:45.465
(clears throat):
My program's got something here.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.404
Hey, look in the eyebrow.

17:51.471 --> 17:55.608
I think those
are numbers.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.379
My algorithm was able

17:59.446 --> 18:03.116
to find an image embedded
in, in this region here.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.385
I e-mailed a JPEG to your techs.

18:05.452 --> 18:10.423
They stripped away
the extraneous squares,

18:10.490 --> 18:14.026
which then revealed a series
of letters and numbers.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.928
MEGAN:
Two letters and nine digits;

18:15.995 --> 18:17.464
can't be a phone number.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.699
But it could be
an international banking number.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.134
It's definitely
an offshore account.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.470
Cyprus.
Check it out.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.673
First two letters: C-Y.
That's the country code.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.608
Now, this next file
is very interesting.

18:28.675 --> 18:32.745
This is one that Kim
posted of herself.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.815
I gave it to your guys
to isolate, as well.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.624
DAVID: It looks like
a Chinese character.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.894
-DON: Yeah. Enhance that?
Enhance that? -Okay.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.695
Two names.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.263
"Terry Evans," uh,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.899
and "Richard Freeman."

18:52.965 --> 18:55.502
She file-shared the photograph
from a chat room,

18:55.568 --> 18:56.769
but you know
there's no way

18:56.836 --> 18:58.505
to trace who might have
downloaded it, so...

18:58.571 --> 19:01.441
Evans and Freeman were federal
witnesses scheduled

19:01.508 --> 19:04.511
to testify against a
guy named Jason Ming

19:04.577 --> 19:05.645
until they were murdered.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.248
DAVID:
Double tap. That's center mass.

19:08.315 --> 19:11.117
This is not just a murder,
it's a hit.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.753
Ming was arrested four months
ago for selling laser gyroscopes

19:13.820 --> 19:16.923
to North Korea
for a Chinese contact.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.125
So the next time the North
Koreans fire a missile,

19:19.192 --> 19:20.727
maybe it hits
North America

19:20.793 --> 19:21.994
and not the ocean.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.063
Ming posted a $3 million bail.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.266
A week later the two witnesses
against him were dead.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.100
You know,
these two witnesses' names

19:28.167 --> 19:29.135
were in a sealed indictment.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.503
That's a paper file.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.605
So someone physically
had to get that info

19:32.672 --> 19:34.807
-and give it to Kim.
-Only people with access

19:34.874 --> 19:37.244
to a sealed indictment
are federal prosecutors.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.178
MEGAN:
And federal agents.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.881
Which means there's a mole
in the Department of Justice,

19:41.948 --> 19:43.883
and if the Chinese have

19:43.950 --> 19:45.885
someone in the DOJ...

19:45.952 --> 19:48.721
Then they can get
to any witness they want...

19:48.788 --> 19:51.190
any case they want.

19:56.963 --> 19:57.930
Hey.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.335
Man, Granger, you scared
the crap out of me.

20:02.402 --> 20:05.972
Michelle Kim-- the
last time you saw her

20:06.038 --> 20:07.507
was two years ago?

20:07.574 --> 20:10.109
I already told you that.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.779
Yeah, tell me again.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.647
It's boot camp.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.783
They train you
to put your shades on your back

20:16.849 --> 20:19.352
when you're approaching
a target.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.459
I guess old habits die hard.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.767
I should bust your ass right now
for lying to me!

20:34.834 --> 20:36.503
She approached me

20:36.569 --> 20:38.271
after I did
the background check,

20:38.338 --> 20:41.474
and we ended up
sleeping together.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.542
But that's it.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.543
Why didn't you

20:43.610 --> 20:44.977
just tell me that
from the get-go?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.447
Why do you think I didn't tell
you? I work counterintelligence.

20:47.514 --> 20:50.082
I'm supposed to be following
people like Kim.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.585
You're telling me that
you knew she was a spy?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.956
I had a pretty good idea.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.561
How about an idea
about killing witnesses

21:01.628 --> 21:03.963
who were going to testify
against a fugitive

21:04.030 --> 21:05.865
on the U.S. Marshal's
Ten Most Wanted list?

21:05.932 --> 21:07.434
Think I had something
to do with that?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.636
What do you want
me to think?!

21:14.541 --> 21:16.476
After I got back
from Afghanistan,

21:16.543 --> 21:21.381
things with Jenny and me
went south quick.

21:21.448 --> 21:25.452
I ended up living
in a small apartment

21:25.518 --> 21:29.522
with some judge telling me
when I could see my son.

21:29.589 --> 21:34.226
After I interviewed Michelle,
she called me,

21:34.293 --> 21:37.764
and we met up
a couple of times.

21:37.830 --> 21:41.133
She showed me some
attention, you know?

21:41.200 --> 21:46.105
I knew better,
but I went for it.

21:46.172 --> 21:51.411
But that was all it was.

21:54.347 --> 21:58.284
So when-when was the last time
that you actually saw her?

21:58.351 --> 22:00.787
Not the night she was killed.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.490
Look, a-any of this
becomes an issue,

22:03.556 --> 22:06.626
I will come clean--
you have my word.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.628
(sighs)

22:11.864 --> 22:14.767
You'd be baked inside a Humvee
if it wasn't for me.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.604
You really think
I'd screw you now?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.812
(sighs)

22:29.315 --> 22:31.784
CHARLIE: You know, the number
of espionage cases

22:31.851 --> 22:32.919
that we've prosecuted

22:32.985 --> 22:36.989
in the past decade
has increased... 300%.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.325
Spies, huh? Is that
what you're working on?

22:39.392 --> 22:40.693
Yep.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.329
Hey, did you know that nobody
ever heard of James Bond

22:43.396 --> 22:44.931
until President Kennedy
confessed

22:44.997 --> 22:48.000
that he had read the Ian Fleming
novels before going to bed?

22:48.067 --> 22:50.136
Did you know that?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.471
What, you don't believe it?

22:51.538 --> 22:53.606
Well, this is more than fiction.

22:53.673 --> 22:56.543
Hey... you ever have a problem

22:56.609 --> 22:59.946
with... someone that
you respected at work?

23:00.012 --> 23:02.281
Why, you having
troubles at work?

23:02.348 --> 23:03.550
Larry.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.885
-Larry?
-He published his latest paper.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.455
He didn't ask me to collaborate.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.656
Well, I mean,
with his experience,

23:09.722 --> 23:11.424
what has he got to do,
check with you?

23:11.491 --> 23:14.961
-Well, okay, that's not the
point. -Well, what is the point?

23:15.027 --> 23:16.629
That his paper is good.

23:16.696 --> 23:19.466
It could be great.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.100
With your help, huh?

23:21.167 --> 23:22.735
Well...

23:23.970 --> 23:26.473
You know, there was
a time at work,

23:26.539 --> 23:28.641
I was at the City
Planning Office.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.878
My, uh, my boss had
a design, and, um,

23:31.944 --> 23:33.913
I don't know,
I thought I saw something.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.348
I mean, the plan
was fine as it was,

23:36.415 --> 23:37.984
but I thought that, um,

23:38.050 --> 23:41.454
I had seen something...
that I could make better.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.189
What'd you do?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.057
Nothing.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.193
Because I had to decide

23:47.259 --> 23:49.696
which was more important,
my relationship with my boss

23:49.762 --> 23:51.464
or with our client.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.434
Why don't you ask yourself this:

23:55.502 --> 23:58.705
Are you really ready to tell
Larry that his work is good

23:58.771 --> 24:01.040
but just not good enough?

24:04.611 --> 24:06.479
COLBY:
Hey, David.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.647
Any luck finding

24:07.714 --> 24:08.915
more cameras
in Kim's building?

24:08.981 --> 24:11.684
No, these were the only
ones, here in the lobby.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.052
Couldn't really tell
which apartment

24:13.119 --> 24:16.155
the guests were going up to, and
so far Kim's always been alone.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.557
CHARLIE:
You know, um...

24:17.624 --> 24:19.759
(clears throat):
that might not be true.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.028
What's up, Charlie?
What are you doing here?

24:22.094 --> 24:23.162
Well, I'm just...

24:23.229 --> 24:24.430
working on something for Larry.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.965
Look, you said that the footage

24:26.032 --> 24:28.234
-from these cameras is archived,
right? -Yeah, that's right.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.203
Okay, well, then, look, if the
apartment is a meeting place,

24:31.270 --> 24:33.773
then chances are your mole
has been there more than once.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.407
Yeah, but, I mean,
there are months

24:35.474 --> 24:36.709
of footage
and hundreds of guests.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.845
-Okay, but we know when Kim
was there, right? -Yeah,

24:38.911 --> 24:40.146
-but so?
-So I can run

24:40.212 --> 24:41.548
a series of Eigenfaces.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.982
COLBY:
Eigenfaces?

24:43.049 --> 24:44.383
Advanced facial-recognition
techniques.

24:44.450 --> 24:47.253
I've been working on a program
that matches human asymmetry.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.454
So I can create
an algorithm

24:48.521 --> 24:49.956
that matches all visitors
to the apartment

24:50.022 --> 24:52.659
at the times that we know
that Kim was there.

24:52.725 --> 24:53.760
Asymmetry points?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.728
Come on, Charlie,
help us out here, man.

24:55.795 --> 24:58.965
(sighs): No human face
is perfectly symmetrical.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.034
Let's say

25:02.101 --> 25:04.236
that each little square
of a Rubik's Cube

25:04.303 --> 25:07.273
represents a symmetry point--
nose, ear or eye.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.408
When the right combination
is found,

25:09.475 --> 25:13.479
an individual symmetry point
or body part is matched.

25:13.546 --> 25:14.614
Hey, I just heard
from the LAPD

25:14.681 --> 25:17.016
there's a chop shop
in Van Nuys that has

25:17.083 --> 25:19.752
an SUV that matches
the one that hit our girl.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.229
-What's up?
-Help you with something?

25:30.296 --> 25:31.163
Yeah. You Tyler?

25:31.230 --> 25:33.566
-Yeah.
-I want to get some rims.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.701
What size?

25:34.767 --> 25:37.036
-22's.
-How many you need?

25:37.103 --> 25:39.105
-COLBY: Four of 'em
would be great. -Four rims.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.873
Means we've got four guys
to deal with.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.775
Nice and chromed,
if you can swing it.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.644
Chrome.
Somebody's got a gun.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.078
All right, let's go.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.484
Call it
a thousand even.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.986
FBI! You! Down!

25:55.588 --> 25:57.256
Hey! You with the gun!
Put it down!

25:57.323 --> 25:59.325
Hey! Put the gun on the floor!

25:59.391 --> 26:00.526
Hey!

26:00.593 --> 26:01.527
He dies,

26:01.594 --> 26:02.629
you die!

26:02.695 --> 26:04.063
Oh, no, no!
Here's how it goes!

26:04.130 --> 26:06.766
I get out of here,
or you both die!

26:06.833 --> 26:07.667
David, shoot this dude.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.168
-Will you just shoot him?!
-Shut up!

26:09.235 --> 26:11.337
-Drop him now!
-Shut up! Shut up!

26:11.403 --> 26:12.639
Easy! Easy. Think.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.941
Think about it--
there's no way out of here.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.743
You got no options.
Put it down.

26:16.809 --> 26:17.977
-I mean it.
-David,

26:18.044 --> 26:19.345
shoot...

26:19.411 --> 26:21.180
-(grunts)
-(yells)

26:22.348 --> 26:23.850
(Tyler groaning, coughing)

26:26.585 --> 26:27.553
(cries in pain)

26:27.620 --> 26:28.721
You okay?

26:28.788 --> 26:30.623
Yeah. Already
told you, I'm fine.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.792
That was a close call
earlier, man.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.827
Comes with
the territory, right?

26:34.894 --> 26:36.696
Just saying, man,
that's not like you

26:36.763 --> 26:38.497
to not bring
your "A" game, brother.

26:38.564 --> 26:41.968
A guy gets a jump on me,
and suddenly I'm losing it?

26:42.034 --> 26:43.335
I'm just saying, man.

26:43.402 --> 26:46.372
Last couple of days
you been kind of quiet.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.007
I'm your partner, man--

26:48.074 --> 26:50.276
if there's something on your
mind, just let me know, okay?

26:50.342 --> 26:53.445
Look, David, I appreciate what
you did in there, all right?

26:53.512 --> 26:55.514
But I am fine.

26:55.581 --> 26:57.717
See you tomorrow.

26:59.251 --> 27:00.586
Okay.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.454
Hey, I got it.

27:02.521 --> 27:03.555
-Got what?
-I-I got

27:03.622 --> 27:04.791
an idea on your mole.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.458
That asymmetry model
really paid off.

27:06.525 --> 27:08.494
Check this out.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.664
This is your
most likely suspect.

27:11.731 --> 27:14.433
The past three months,
Kim was at her apartment

27:14.500 --> 27:16.135
24 times--
eight of those times

27:16.202 --> 27:19.138
-this guy shows up within
an hour. -You sure about that?

27:19.205 --> 27:20.773
Yeah, I mean, I'm very sure.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.074
Once I established this image,

27:22.141 --> 27:24.543
I cross-referenced it
with the photo I.D. database

27:24.610 --> 27:27.379
at the Department of Justice.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.749
Whoa...

27:29.816 --> 27:30.983
that's Dwayne Carter.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.418
Isn't that, like,

27:32.484 --> 27:35.021
Colby's Army buddy
in Counter Intelligence?

27:35.087 --> 27:36.422
It's not like; it is.

27:43.629 --> 27:44.764
Hey.

27:44.831 --> 27:45.798
Where is he?

27:45.865 --> 27:47.499
He's on his way in.

27:47.566 --> 27:48.935
What are you gonna do?

27:49.001 --> 27:50.302
I don't know yet.

27:50.369 --> 27:53.272
What, you got something
you want to say?

27:53.339 --> 27:54.874
Don, if Colby
withheld something,

27:54.941 --> 27:56.943
I'm sure he had a
good reason for it.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.112
Where are we on the warrant
for Carter's place?

28:00.179 --> 28:02.448
The attorney general
approved that this morning.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.950
All right, well, as soon as

28:04.016 --> 28:06.352
they let us know
he's out, we're going in.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.386
Sure you want to wait?

28:07.453 --> 28:09.822
We have enough to bring
him in right now.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.157
That's Homeland's call--

28:11.223 --> 28:13.225
they want to find out
more about the setup,

28:13.292 --> 28:15.061
see if there's any connection
to the consulate.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.963
Well, so far,
the cash withdrawals

28:17.029 --> 28:18.364
from Kim's bank account

28:18.430 --> 28:20.699
correspond to a bunch
of deposits that Carter made,

28:20.767 --> 28:23.502
but we haven't had any luck
tracing Kim's source.

28:23.569 --> 28:25.604
Just keep digging.

28:25.671 --> 28:28.040
Hey, you wanted to see me?

28:28.107 --> 28:31.778
Uh, yeah, you got
that right.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.214
All right, straight up,
I want to know

28:35.281 --> 28:37.649
if you knew it was Carter
on that tape.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.452
-(exhales): I had a feeling,
yeah. -You had a feeling,

28:40.519 --> 28:41.653
and you don't bring it to me?

28:41.720 --> 28:44.323
Don, the guy's a friend of mine.
He made a mistake.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.625
-It had nothing to do
with the case. -Your friend

28:46.692 --> 28:49.161
is bought and paid for
by the Chinese government.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.335
(sighs)

28:56.402 --> 28:58.938
I had no idea.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.907
Any money exchange hands
between you two?

29:03.609 --> 29:06.212
You lied to me-- I'm not exactly
clear on the reason now.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.714
I would never tank
an investigation, Don.

29:08.781 --> 29:09.816
You know that.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.718
-Well, you crossed the line
here. -What, and you haven't?

29:12.785 --> 29:14.153
Excuse me?

29:14.220 --> 29:16.222
When Megan was kidnapped--
you know what I'm talking about.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.357
-Yeah. To save a life?
-Yeah, I was trying to save

29:18.424 --> 29:19.992
a buddy's career
from going down the drain.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.460
Look, Dwayne
admitted to me

29:21.527 --> 29:23.295
that he was sleeping with Kim,

29:23.362 --> 29:24.763
but he swore to me

29:24.831 --> 29:27.233
that it had nothing to do
with our case.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.234
He swore to you.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.969
Look, you're off the case.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.040
(groans softly)

29:37.944 --> 29:39.778
Do you have him?
Megan?

29:39.846 --> 29:43.782
Megan.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.151
Biceps look pretty good.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.953
He should be in
there a while.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.187
Now that you're
done staring,

29:48.254 --> 29:51.390
-we might be able to get
the job done. -(mock chuckling)

29:55.027 --> 29:57.429
Dining room.

29:57.496 --> 29:58.965
Bathroom.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.334
Clear.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.837
I got a laptop in here.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.145
(chuckles): Hey...
they look like brothers there,

30:13.212 --> 30:15.247
-don't they?
-Yeah.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.961
I'm in.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.229
Damn it, he's getting out
already.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.797
No, no, I need more time.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.399
How about 45 seconds?

30:33.465 --> 30:35.167
Do I have 46?

30:35.234 --> 30:37.069
44. Come on.

30:47.914 --> 30:49.315
David.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.582
I'm coming.

30:55.754 --> 30:57.189
Come on.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.840
-(knocking)
-Yeah, I'm coming.

31:14.907 --> 31:17.476
-Hey, Larry.
-Alan.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.745
Hey, is-is Charles here?

31:19.811 --> 31:22.348
-Uh, no.
-Good.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.150
That's good.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.485
That's very good.

31:26.552 --> 31:27.719
Can I get you something?

31:27.786 --> 31:29.755
Hey, look at this.

31:29.821 --> 31:32.791
Why, to graduate Princeton
at 16!

31:32.858 --> 31:33.892
I was good,

31:33.960 --> 31:35.594
but... it took me

31:35.661 --> 31:38.097
till the more normal age of 19.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.531
Yeah, well, in that first year,

31:39.598 --> 31:41.733
we heard an awful lot
about Professor Fleinhardt.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.169
Yeah.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.171
You know, he spent half the time

31:45.237 --> 31:47.606
trying to prove
the T.A.'s thesis

31:47.673 --> 31:48.774
was wrong.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.443
Well, Charlie was never afraid
to give his opinion.

31:51.510 --> 31:52.378
Yeah, well,

31:52.444 --> 31:53.579
of course, Charles was right.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.915
Is there something
bothering you, Larry?

31:56.983 --> 31:59.385
Charles is having trouble
understanding

31:59.451 --> 32:01.420
why I didn't ask for his help

32:01.487 --> 32:03.422
on this recent paper
that I published.

32:03.489 --> 32:04.957
-Oh?
-Yeah. I mean, it's not

32:05.024 --> 32:06.325
that I don't value
his input.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.327
I mean, you know that I do.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.929
-But?
-Alan, Charles's work

32:10.997 --> 32:13.065
at the FBI
increasingly consumes him.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.367
Yeah, we know that, but...

32:15.434 --> 32:16.802
In my field,

32:16.868 --> 32:19.005
dependence on any one person,

32:19.071 --> 32:21.740
that can spell the end
of a career.

32:21.807 --> 32:24.810
And I'm just not ready to go.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.745
Not yet.

32:26.812 --> 32:30.316
You know, there's also
something called pride,

32:30.382 --> 32:32.051
and I've never found that

32:32.118 --> 32:33.952
a great justification
for anything.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.224
That was SOG.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.492
Bank manager inadvertently
tipped Carter off

32:40.559 --> 32:42.694
that subpoenas are being
served on his accounts.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.796
Well, is that your way
of saying he's gone?

32:44.863 --> 32:46.098
Yeah, he knows we're on to him.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.300
All right,
if Carter's on the run,

32:48.367 --> 32:52.104
then he has access to all kinds
of fake IDs, passports.

32:52.171 --> 32:53.239
Yeah, but we have his money.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.506
Just let me
ask you this:

32:54.573 --> 32:55.641
you think he's
the type of guy

32:55.707 --> 32:57.809
who's gonna hang around
for like one last score?

32:57.876 --> 32:58.744
I'd buy that.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.047
He probably has the name
of every FBI informant

33:01.113 --> 33:02.481
working against the Chinese.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.550
We have the Consulate covered,
so there's no way

33:04.616 --> 33:05.984
he's gonna make contact there.

33:06.052 --> 33:07.486
I mean, it could be
pre-arranged, right?

33:07.553 --> 33:09.655
Look, he's meeting her
on a regular basis.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.257
Yeah, but that was at
the apartment.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.724
Yeah, but at some point, his
handlers got to want

33:12.791 --> 33:14.693
to meet him, they got to want
to check him out.

33:14.760 --> 33:15.794
And there's no way

33:15.861 --> 33:17.696
she's gonna bring them all
to that apartment.

33:17.763 --> 33:20.132
You know, Carter's PDA

33:20.199 --> 33:22.601
had a bunch of meetings
on company time

33:22.668 --> 33:24.370
that the Bureau
couldn't explain.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.272
Yeah, you got
the times?

33:26.338 --> 33:28.374
They're all like
11:00 to 1:00.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.941
Well, you have, uh,
the locations

33:30.008 --> 33:32.244
-of the meets here? -They're
spread throughout the city.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.280
You know what, do me a favor,
e-mail them to Charlie,

33:34.346 --> 33:35.814
maybe he can come
up with something.

33:35.881 --> 33:38.284
MEGAN: We're worried
that Carter's going to try

33:38.350 --> 33:39.785
and sell whatever information
he's got

33:39.851 --> 33:40.852
before he leaves
the country.

33:40.919 --> 33:43.155
And these appointments
from Carter's PDA

33:43.222 --> 33:45.023
are meetings between
him and the Chinese?

33:45.091 --> 33:46.725
We think so.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.026
Hmm...

33:48.094 --> 33:50.329
Well, a lot of these addresses

33:50.396 --> 33:52.098
are within a couple miles
of the FBI.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.432
Now I've learned from the NSA

33:53.499 --> 33:56.635
that operatives will often
schedule meeting places,

33:56.702 --> 33:58.904
like, months in advance--
they're given a list.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.639
And no two
meeting places

34:00.706 --> 34:01.907
are ever the same.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.742
Okay, so we can then
logically assume

34:03.809 --> 34:05.777
that the meeting place is
somewhere inside this circle?

34:05.844 --> 34:07.779
-Right.
-It's a classic combinatorial

34:07.846 --> 34:09.081
optimization problem.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.783
And no one is better at
combinatorics than you.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.585
Who else could be?

34:13.652 --> 34:17.055
It's simply a question
of branching and bounding.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.257
Branching and bounding?

34:18.324 --> 34:20.992
So you're trying to predict

34:21.059 --> 34:22.428
how a tree is going to branch.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.131
And you know where
six of the branches'

34:25.197 --> 34:26.598
meeting places already are.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.400
Now where will that
seventh branch--

34:28.467 --> 34:30.602
Carter's next
meeting place-- be?

34:30.669 --> 34:32.871
Certain factors can help us
eliminate potential branches.

34:32.938 --> 34:35.807
Like, we know that Carter has to
make a clean and fast getaway.

34:35.874 --> 34:38.610
See, these meetings are taking
place in areas that are

34:38.677 --> 34:41.480
zoned for businesses with open
courtyards, with promenades,

34:41.547 --> 34:43.482
with multiple entrances
and exits.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.484
One was Pershing Square...

34:45.551 --> 34:46.752
And one was the Staples Center.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.487
They're both close to the
freeway, easy getaways.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.456
Right, and so,
by running an algorithm

34:50.522 --> 34:52.991
that analyzes the features
of the existing meeting places

34:53.058 --> 34:54.226
to find key variables,

34:54.293 --> 34:57.129
then by applying a branching
and bounding algorithm,

34:57.196 --> 34:58.697
we can hopefully identify

34:58.764 --> 35:01.066
where Carter's next meeting
place will be.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.301
Okay. Thank you.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.604
DAVID:
Sinclair for Eppes.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.072
Go for Eppes.

35:07.139 --> 35:09.775
SOG's got nothing on the other
locations Charlie's listed.

35:09.841 --> 35:10.976
All right, just give it

35:11.042 --> 35:12.010
time, you know?

35:12.077 --> 35:14.580
I thought Carter took all of his
meetings during the daytime.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.848
That's why it's called
probability.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.255
Wait, hold on.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.526
Yeah, I got eyes on him.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.261
DAVID:
Hey, that's Chen,

35:29.328 --> 35:30.596
the guy from the Consulate.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.930
I don't know,
he looks pretty calm.

35:31.997 --> 35:34.233
I don't think he knows
we're on him.

35:37.203 --> 35:38.270
Don, Carter

35:38.337 --> 35:39.538
just passed him something.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.641
DON: All right, let's
follow him. Don't bumper lock.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.576
Bravo Team take Chen
outside the park.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.577
We got Carter.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.746
(over radio):
Roger that, we got Chen.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.748
Adam-23, go.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.917
Bravo team, copy.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.853
All right, he's turning right
onto Broadway.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.289
Stay back, everybody.
Wait for me, wait for me.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.291
-Copy that, David?
-Copy that.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.092
MAN: Got units stationed
Fourth and Glower.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.561
All right, wait.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.396
He's going eastbound into

36:04.463 --> 36:05.397
the Second Street tunnel.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.532
All right, let's box him in.

36:06.598 --> 36:07.899
-(siren blares)
-Sinclair to Adam 23.

36:07.966 --> 36:08.900
I want you to lock up

36:08.967 --> 36:10.836
the east end of
the Second Street tunnel.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.170
Shut it down right now.

36:12.238 --> 36:13.939
(sirens blare)

36:24.450 --> 36:27.152
Get your hands
out of the windows!

36:27.219 --> 36:29.855
Get your hands
out of the windows now!

36:31.657 --> 36:34.593
Driver, keep your hands out
of the window, open the door

36:34.660 --> 36:36.061
and step toward my voice.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.296
Nice and easy.

36:37.363 --> 36:38.997
Just step toward my voice.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.333
Dwayne, you don't want us
pulling you out of that car.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.368
I'm doing it!

36:42.434 --> 36:43.335
Don't shoot!

36:43.402 --> 36:46.805
Unit 17, shut down east side
of Second Street tunnel.

36:46.872 --> 36:47.973
Come on. David.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.375
Come on, hands
behind your back.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.018
Come on.

37:00.085 --> 37:02.754
You've got to be
kidding me.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.757
Colby was right,
this guy is good.

37:05.824 --> 37:06.992
Here, catch.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.297
Unbelievable.

37:17.102 --> 37:19.405
Chen isn't talking to anyone,
and the State Department's

37:19.471 --> 37:20.939
certainly not going
to lean on him.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.808
They've got bigger stakes
with China.

37:22.874 --> 37:25.911
We've got surveillance on the
airports, public and private.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.547
Border Patrol has a copy
of Carter's profile.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.181
Guy works in intelligence
ten years,

37:30.248 --> 37:32.284
he's not taking
public transportation.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.252
Don, if Carter has an exit plan,

37:34.320 --> 37:36.455
Colby is our best chance
for figuring it out.

37:36.522 --> 37:38.457
Yeah, well, Colby's
not on the case.

37:38.524 --> 37:39.858
I mean, I can't trust him.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.394
Whatever happened between him
and Carter blurred his judgment.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.530
Why don't you let David
try and call him?

37:44.596 --> 37:46.532
I already tried.
Got his voicemail.

37:46.598 --> 37:49.468
Guy's got something to say
to me, he knows where I am.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.741
Guess you got to keep the boat
in the divorce settlement.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.745
Do me a favor and untie
that bow line.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.113
For a guy who loves the ocean,

38:02.180 --> 38:06.552
I never could understand why you
chose to go to the desert.

38:07.819 --> 38:11.457
If I hadn't, you'd be dead.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.493
They took my badge, my gun.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.929
Then there's nothing
keeping you here, right?

38:20.098 --> 38:23.535
Look, I got something to sell

38:23.602 --> 38:26.104
that'd be enough
for the both of us.

38:26.171 --> 38:29.608
Yeah, and how many people
are gonna die this time?

38:29.675 --> 38:32.310
You killed two
innocent witnesses.

38:32.378 --> 38:33.779
And Michelle Kim?

38:35.781 --> 38:38.216
When I met her,
I must've looked like a deer

38:38.283 --> 38:39.317
caught in the headlights.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.387
I mean, this girl,
she was all over me.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.422
At first, it was just
drinks and sex.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.491
Yeah, and then what?

38:45.557 --> 38:47.493
I was only giving her
useless information.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.495
And every dime of it
went to my kid.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.296
No, the information
you sold her killed

38:51.363 --> 38:53.098
two federal witnesses.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.836
-A murderer went free because
of it. -She blackmailed me.

38:57.903 --> 39:00.406
She told me if I didn't steal

39:00.472 --> 39:03.475
high-level information,
she would expose me.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.644
So, what, you killed her
to save your ass?

39:08.213 --> 39:09.748
I saved your ass once.

39:11.550 --> 39:14.653
You remember?

39:16.488 --> 39:19.758
What help am I to my son
if I'm in prison?

39:21.660 --> 39:23.429
There was nothing I could do.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.532
I didn't have
any other choice.

39:26.598 --> 39:29.501
You got a choice now.

39:29.568 --> 39:30.869
You can come in with me.

39:30.936 --> 39:34.473
It's not gonna make
anything right,

39:34.540 --> 39:36.575
but it might just give
your kid one chance

39:36.642 --> 39:38.877
at least to forgive his father.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.350
What if I don't?

39:45.417 --> 39:46.618
Huh?

39:50.188 --> 39:53.058
You were one of the bravest
soldiers I ever knew, Dwayne.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.763
(yells)

39:57.829 --> 39:59.698
No!

40:03.268 --> 40:05.937
Granger.

40:10.976 --> 40:12.277
Granger...

40:12.343 --> 40:13.979
Come on, give me the tape.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.714
Give me the tape.

40:16.682 --> 40:18.016
You gonna kill me?

40:20.251 --> 40:21.219
Go ahead, man.

40:21.286 --> 40:22.888
Go ahead.

40:24.389 --> 40:26.424
(distant sirens approaching)

40:39.304 --> 40:41.507
Put it down!

40:41.573 --> 40:44.309
Carter,
drop the gun!

40:44.375 --> 40:45.477
Colby, get out
of the way!

40:45.544 --> 40:47.178
I can't believe
you did this to me!

40:47.245 --> 40:48.279
Drop that gun!

40:48.346 --> 40:49.314
Put it down!

40:49.380 --> 40:50.549
Drop it!

40:52.951 --> 40:53.919
No.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.421
No, Dwayne...

40:56.488 --> 40:58.023
no, you did it to yourself.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.093
Dwayne Carter!

41:02.160 --> 41:03.662
Drop that gun!
Put it down!

41:03.729 --> 41:06.498
Hands up! Now!

41:06.565 --> 41:07.633
Hands up!

41:07.699 --> 41:09.568
Drop the gun.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.609
You know, I've
never been in combat.

41:17.676 --> 41:19.911
But I've been in my
share of fire fights

41:19.978 --> 41:22.380
and you know what scares
the hell out of me?

41:22.447 --> 41:24.282
It's not dying.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.518
It's letting my guys down.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.019
You know?

41:28.086 --> 41:30.155
Losing trust.

41:31.723 --> 41:35.594
You do it again,
you're going to jail.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.574
Still trying to untie yourself.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.641
There's over 70

41:49.708 --> 41:51.409
precise moves with this.

41:51.476 --> 41:52.544
Well, they don't call it

41:52.611 --> 41:54.680
the world's toughest
brain teaser for nothing.

41:54.746 --> 41:56.748
You know, I used to
be able to do these

41:56.815 --> 41:58.550
in under two minutes.
Now, it's over six.

41:58.617 --> 41:59.885
Oh, that's still
pretty good.

41:59.951 --> 42:00.819
Yeah.

42:00.886 --> 42:03.088
It's not my best.

42:05.090 --> 42:08.093
Neither was hiring Stromsborg
as my collaborator.

42:09.761 --> 42:13.131
Larry, we've discussed this,
Stromsborg's good.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.433
Yeah, but he's
not the best.

42:15.500 --> 42:19.871
What I forgot to keep in mind
was the paper meant nothing.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.472
You see,

42:21.539 --> 42:22.841
it was all about the work.

42:22.908 --> 42:24.175
Or should've been.

42:24.242 --> 42:27.478
Speaking of work,

42:27.545 --> 42:29.180
I could still
use your help...

42:29.247 --> 42:30.582
if it's not too late.

42:30.649 --> 42:32.550
Larry...

42:32.618 --> 42:35.286
I have a confession
to make.

42:35.353 --> 42:36.855
Yeah?

42:36.922 --> 42:38.590
I already read the paper.

42:38.657 --> 42:40.025
Oh.

42:40.091 --> 42:40.892
And?

42:40.959 --> 42:44.262
You want me to be honest
with you?

42:44.329 --> 42:45.130
No, I don't.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.932
I want to remain
a blithering idiot.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.367
Yes, of course,
I want your honesty.

42:49.434 --> 42:51.202
Larry...

42:51.269 --> 42:53.672
I never want to lose you
as a friend.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.340
And you never shall.

42:56.675 --> 42:58.276
Your paper...

42:59.678 --> 43:01.512
it's a work of genius.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.381
Okay, now there.

43:03.448 --> 43:04.415
Was that so hard?

43:04.482 --> 43:06.484
-But...
-But...

43:06.551 --> 43:09.387
it would have benefited
from the work

43:09.454 --> 43:11.322
of two geniuses.

43:11.389 --> 43:12.557
Yeah.

43:12.624 --> 43:15.026
Simon and Garfunkel, perhaps?

43:15.093 --> 43:17.395
Okay. Fine, yes.

43:17.462 --> 43:19.665
As long as I'm Simon.

43:19.731 --> 43:23.134
Well, Charles,
ever the pragmatist.
