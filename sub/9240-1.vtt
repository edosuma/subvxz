01:59.720 --> 02:01.210
Hi, Curly.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.346
Remember me?

02:03.824 --> 02:05.382
Mitch Robbins?

02:05.793 --> 02:08.023
I was on your last cattle drive.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.423
Remember? We birthed that calf together.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.862
How you been?

02:14.502 --> 02:17.994
I'm sorry.
That's a stupid thing to say, because...

02:18.739 --> 02:22.140
Why get into that? Why depress you?

02:23.110 --> 02:24.543
Anyway...

02:25.613 --> 02:27.843
I think about you a lot.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.279
You changed my whole life.

02:31.085 --> 02:33.076
You were right, cowboy.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.645
"One thing. "

02:36.424 --> 02:38.085
"Just one thing. "

02:48.169 --> 02:50.603
City folk.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.678
I buried him alive!

03:32.813 --> 03:33.802
Hello?

05:05.840 --> 05:06.829
Yes!

06:07.234 --> 06:08.565
Hi, Mom.

06:09.703 --> 06:13.469
It's September 8, 1952.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.803
We're driving back from Aunt Marsha's,
my water breaks...

06:17.878 --> 06:21.143
your father jumps the divider
of the Saw Mill River Parkway...

06:21.215 --> 06:23.706
and races me to Doctors' Hospital...

06:24.151 --> 06:26.312
and at 5:16...

06:27.988 --> 06:30.149
out you came.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.720
Happy birthday, darling!

06:34.194 --> 06:37.186
I can't believe you're 40.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.560
I'm overcome. Talk to your father.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.828
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, boy. Happy birthday.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.305
Thanks. How are you?

06:47.374 --> 06:50.935
I got a cyst on my testicle.
Here's your mother.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.002
Don't worry, he's fine.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.343
So, how does it feel to be 40?

06:56.517 --> 06:59.509
- Actually, Mom, I feel great.
- Why, what's wrong?

06:59.586 --> 07:02.680
Ma, he's fine. He's never been better.

07:03.958 --> 07:06.688
You're there, too? Hi, Barbara.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.887
Well, listen, you two, have a...

07:08.963 --> 07:12.126
Leo, Leo! The dog needs to go out.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.531
Leo! He's impossible.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.466
- I'm gonna have him neutered.
- She means the dog.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.903
Stop that!

07:18.973 --> 07:21.464
I've got to go, he's peeing on the carpet!

07:21.542 --> 07:23.100
She means Dad.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.574
'Bye, Mom.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.708
'Bye, angel birthday boy.

07:31.819 --> 07:32.808
'Bye.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.720
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.691
Oh, boy!

07:41.261 --> 07:43.923
- What a nightmare.
- They're your parents.

07:44.398 --> 07:47.561
No, not them.
I had a nightmare that was...

07:48.235 --> 07:50.999
I don't want to talk about it...

07:51.071 --> 07:54.199
because today is my birthday.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.174
The big 4-0.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.245
And I feel good, I really feel great.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.078
I feel good, yes.

08:03.617 --> 08:08.554
Nurse, today is my birthday.
I'd like to look at the ocean, please.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.847
Thank you.

08:11.025 --> 08:14.358
I'm 40. And you know what?
It's not so terrible.

08:14.428 --> 08:17.761
There's no surprise party, right?
Please, no surprise party?

08:17.831 --> 08:21.597
Abe's wife threw a surprise party,
he walked in, they yelled, "Surprise! "...

08:21.668 --> 08:24.637
and he said, "Bigger surprise:
I'm having a heart attack! "

08:24.705 --> 08:27.538
Abe Goodman weighed 400 pounds.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.769
Who are you telling, I was a pallbearer.

08:30.044 --> 08:32.274
I had to help carry that camper
he was buried in.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.813
No surprise party.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.015
Just dinner and the movies,
you, me, and the kids...

08:37.284 --> 08:40.775
then both the kids
are going to sleep over at my sister's.

08:41.655 --> 08:46.319
And you and I will have
the whole house to ourselves.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.857
All night long.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.959
That's my present to you.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.567
Can I open my present now?

09:00.774 --> 09:01.900
Tonight.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.307
But, look, the little man
wants to go to the parade.

09:10.184 --> 09:12.015
Save your strength.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.810
You'll need it.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.384
I love it up here.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.254
I'm so glad we moved out of the city.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.725
- 'Morning!
- Good morning!

09:22.496 --> 09:24.157
Work is good.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.430
I'm just not pushing time anymore.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.695
I'm the boss now and I like it.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.394
- 'Morning!
- 'Morning!

09:33.073 --> 09:35.974
Want to turn back? Come on, let's go.

09:36.076 --> 09:40.513
How will you get into a bathing suit?
Look at you, you weigh 800 pounds.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.109
And don't tell me ThighMaster.

09:43.183 --> 09:46.118
You're so out of shape.
I'm 40 and you're 1.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.881
Look at you.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.446
You're like this
big tub of veal or something.

09:50.524 --> 09:53.857
Stay in your lane. Why bump me, Norman?
I saved your life.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.755
If it wasn't for me, you'd be 100 wallets.

10:26.260 --> 10:27.659
Okay, we're back.

10:27.861 --> 10:31.490
I'm Dr. Jeffrey Sanborn.
Emotional pain is as real as physical pain.

10:31.565 --> 10:34.864
Just 'cause you can't see a wound
on an X-ray doesn't mean it isn't there.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.869
Remember, I feel your pain.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.767
If you want to talk to me about anything,
call 555-HELP.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.974
We're on the phone now
with Kenny from New Jersey.

10:44.511 --> 10:48.038
- Kenny? Thanks for waiting.
- That's all right.

10:48.682 --> 10:52.015
Kenny, you said
you get extremely depressed at night.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.316
That's when the clothes in my closet
come alive.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.848
Excuse me?

10:57.057 --> 10:59.150
Well, not really, it's...

10:59.426 --> 11:01.951
Nighttime's when I'm alone
and my mind...

11:02.029 --> 11:03.519
I understand.

11:03.597 --> 11:06.498
I pretend there are friends
who come over...

11:06.567 --> 11:08.694
Are these men's or women's clothes?

11:08.769 --> 11:11.932
No, I don't have women's clothes.
They're men's clothes.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.165
None at all?

11:13.507 --> 11:16.237
Hi. Don't forget.
The sales meeting's in 10 minutes.

11:16.310 --> 11:18.540
I want to talk to you about Phil.

11:18.612 --> 11:21.604
Nobody said anything
when you gave your friend your old job...

11:21.682 --> 11:24.048
though he had no experience
in radio or sales...

11:24.117 --> 11:26.051
- I know.
... because you're the boss.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.054
But you said
you'd let him go two months ago.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.555
I know.

11:30.624 --> 11:33.991
- He's costing the station money.
- It takes a while.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.295
He's in his office now.
He's trying his best.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.730
He's been through a tough time.
He's being cleaned out in his divorce.

11:43.804 --> 11:44.964
He's just down.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.565
Then why are you taking him
to the Las Vegas convention?

11:48.642 --> 11:53.170
They'll charge you for excess baggage.
You can't keep putting this off.

11:53.247 --> 11:57.240
Lois, today is my birthday.
Do you know what your present to me is?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.545
Not to talk about this anymore?

11:59.620 --> 12:01.781
Thank you, it's just what I wanted.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.893
We're back with Kenny from New Jersey.

12:10.063 --> 12:14.329
The women you meet, do they say things
to make you feel they don't like you?

12:14.401 --> 12:17.564
It's not anything that they say,
it's just...

12:17.904 --> 12:20.372
an overall feeling I get that they're...

12:22.276 --> 12:24.267
What do you get?

12:25.379 --> 12:27.108
Are you there, Kenny?

12:28.448 --> 12:30.143
Are you all right?

12:30.217 --> 12:32.742
Are the clothes in your closet
coming to life?

12:36.623 --> 12:38.614
- What's happening?
- Wrong number.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.354
Speak to me.

12:40.627 --> 12:43.619
Kenny has to go.
He's cooking breakfast for his underwear.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.388
- Who is this?
- I'm a pair of his socks.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.634
You're calling the station psychiatrist
instead of working?

12:53.140 --> 12:56.906
Well, it's free.
Do you know what psychiatry costs?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.611
Anyway, this guy is helping me.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.405
Helping you?

13:01.481 --> 13:04.678
Last year this guy was doing
our traffic reports from a helicopter.

13:04.751 --> 13:07.652
If this doesn't work,
he's going to be the movie critic.

13:07.721 --> 13:10.417
What's going on?
You were doing so much better.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.157
I'm thinking of going back with Arlene.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.627
Are you serious?

13:16.697 --> 13:19.222
I'm not sure she'd take me back,
but maybe...

13:19.433 --> 13:21.196
Think about what you're saying.

13:21.268 --> 13:24.499
Going back to Arlene
is like breaking back into Alcatraz.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.466
You were miserable with Arlene.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.804
Yeah, but I wasn't lonely.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.915
Come home with me tonight.
It's my birthday, we're going out.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.416
- I forgot your birthday!
- Don't worry about it.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.079
Just come with me.
But you can't sleep over...

13:41.588 --> 13:43.317
because Barbara and I...

13:43.957 --> 13:45.515
- You can't.
- That's okay.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.686
Then this weekend we're going to Vegas.
That'll be fun.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.265
Oh, boy, we got a big meeting,
so come on.

13:57.170 --> 14:01.504
Thank God I've got this job
to go to every day or I'd really go crazy.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.478
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.209
What's with the champagne?
What are we celebrating?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.944
We're celebrating two things.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.919
First, today happens to be
my 40th birthday.

14:16.790 --> 14:20.954
Secondly, and maybe more importantly,
in a minute George Leyton will call...

14:21.027 --> 14:24.258
to inform us officially that we are
the new New York affiliate...

14:24.331 --> 14:26.128
for the Jerry Jackson Show!

14:28.802 --> 14:30.793
- That show's a gold mine!
- Sure is.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.271
Naturally, I had to clear
the 6:00 to 10:00 slots.

14:33.340 --> 14:36.571
We're talking scheduling changes,
marketing, promotion and sales.

14:36.643 --> 14:37.905
This is great for our station!

14:40.180 --> 14:42.273
- Call for Mitch, line 1.
- Put it through.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.078
This must be the call.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.482
Put it on the speaker,
I want to share this with everybody.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.890
'Morning. You have good news for me?

14:51.958 --> 14:54.688
Tonight, I will pull down your pants...

14:54.761 --> 14:57.889
sink my hands into your cute little ass...

14:57.964 --> 15:00.023
and give you a tongue bath.

15:00.333 --> 15:04.326
I'm going to start at your feet
and slowly work my way up...

15:04.905 --> 15:05.894
Hello?

15:11.912 --> 15:13.675
New Rochelle.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.138
Phil, we're here.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.043
We're here.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.920
- Look, come here!
- I'm up.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.255
What?

15:37.370 --> 15:38.359
Nothing.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.701
Excuse me. Coming through.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.880
Curly!

15:56.556 --> 15:57.818
I'm sorry...

16:02.896 --> 16:04.227
Who was that?

16:04.531 --> 16:06.931
I thought it was somebody else.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.097
Come on, it's your birthday. Let's go.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.245
- What if he was a narcoleptic?
- Who?

16:28.088 --> 16:29.077
Curly.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.988
Curly? The trail boss?

16:34.895 --> 16:38.854
They go into these trances
where it looks like they're dead, but...

16:38.932 --> 16:41.594
- they're not.
- He was dead. We checked.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.260
He was...

16:44.938 --> 16:47.133
Why are you even thinking about this?

16:49.075 --> 16:51.305
I thought I just saw Curly on the train.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.003
That's who I was chasing after.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.114
Yeah, right.

16:56.550 --> 16:59.883
We buried him alive.
He was underground for a year...

16:59.953 --> 17:01.887
got up, dusted himself off...

17:01.955 --> 17:04.719
and got on the commuter train
to New Rochelle.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.519
That makes sense.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.358
You're right.

17:08.929 --> 17:11.420
I must just be tired, that's all.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.200
Honey, I'm home.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.244
Guess who's coming to dinner?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.645
So you knew he was coming?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.947
- Yeah, I invited him.
- How could you do that?

17:33.019 --> 17:35.146
- What are you saying?
- I'll leave.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.086
You know I can't stand him.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.987
- Oh, my God.
- Honey, this is Phil, our friend.

17:41.962 --> 17:44.396
I'm not talking about Phil.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.064
You thought I meant Phil?

17:50.604 --> 17:51.593
No, Phil.

17:53.974 --> 17:55.805
I love you.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.033
Then what are we talking about?

17:59.312 --> 18:01.405
- Then you don't know.
- No, I don't.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.971
Can I buy a vowel?

18:03.116 --> 18:06.142
- Your brother's here.
- Oh, no.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.981
Glen? Crazy Glen?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.780
What do you mean, he's here?

18:10.857 --> 18:12.916
What do I mean? He's here!

18:12.993 --> 18:16.121
He's in our den,
watching a Spanish soap opera.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.627
How is he? How did he seem?

18:19.232 --> 18:22.565
He came in and asked me
to make him a sandwich, no crust...

18:22.636 --> 18:25.400
then started making long distance calls.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.564
Oh, God.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.803
First, he did three scenes
from Godfather II.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.735
He still does that? I love that.

18:34.014 --> 18:37.347
I'm warning you.
If you mention The Godfather to him...

18:37.417 --> 18:40.215
I'll rip your arms out
and beat you to death with them.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.186
This started as a good birthday.

18:42.255 --> 18:46.521
- What's he been up to?
- Nothing. He's the vice president of Lazy.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.891
He goes from one family member
to another...

18:48.962 --> 18:51.089
stays there until they throw him out.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.791
He borrows money.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.229
Borrows indicates an intent to repay.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.098
He gets jobs that aren't jobs.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.401
We only hear from him through
change of address cards. He's lost.

19:00.473 --> 19:04.842
He's a lost soul, he's a dented can...
He's behind me, isn't he?

19:07.380 --> 19:08.677
Buenos dias.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.147
Hello, Glen.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.411
- How was your sandwich?
- Delightful.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.984
I'm sorry about what I said.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.416
Water off a duck's back. Come here.

19:19.225 --> 19:22.319
Look at you, you're still
the world's smallest big brother.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.760
- Hey, Glen.
- Phil.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.196
Long time no see. How are you?

19:26.966 --> 19:29.730
I'm getting divorced, I'm living alone...

19:29.903 --> 19:31.894
struggling for a reason to live.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.335
Too much information for me.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.940
I cannot get over this place.
I mean, look at it.

19:40.747 --> 19:45.013
You got birds and trees, and you got
those fish and you got a cow...

19:46.052 --> 19:47.576
By the way...

19:47.654 --> 19:50.316
- there is something wrong with your cow.
- What?

19:51.257 --> 19:55.159
I thought I'd help out with the chores,
you know, so I figured...

19:55.495 --> 19:56.655
milk the cow.

19:56.730 --> 20:00.461
I reach under there
and I'm pulling and tugging.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.090
Nothing, not a drop.

20:02.669 --> 20:06.036
The cow's name is Norman.
You were pulling on his dick.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.337
I'm gonna go wash up.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.809
Let me ask you a question:

20:15.381 --> 20:17.508
Who had Frankie Pentangeli killed?

20:22.021 --> 20:24.148
The Rosato Brothers.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.582
Who gave the order?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.261
I love this.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.487
There was this kid...

20:31.798 --> 20:33.197
I grew up with.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.264
He was younger than me, looked up to me.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.927
We did our first work together.

20:39.172 --> 20:43.108
Worked our way up the streets. Things
were good. We made the most of it.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.141
I got to change.

20:45.211 --> 20:48.442
During prohibition,
we ran molasses into Canada.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.014
Made a fortune.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.348
Ran molasses to Canada.
You should run brains to your head.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.914
I can't believe you two
are from the same gene pool.

20:58.992 --> 21:01.654
- He's from the shallow end.
- When's he leaving?

21:01.928 --> 21:03.691
I'll talk to him tonight.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.525
Hi, Dad. Happy birthday.

21:05.665 --> 21:09.533
- Thanks, Holly. Did you see your uncle?
- He borrowed $10 from me.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.537
- Have you seen your brother?
- He's hiding from Uncle Glen.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.574
Find him and tell him
we're leaving in a few minutes.

21:15.809 --> 21:16.935
Who's that?

21:17.177 --> 21:19.475
It's Curtis. I invited him to come with us.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.605
- Curtis? The lab experiment?
- Dad!

21:23.616 --> 21:28.076
I know you like him, but it's my birthday
and I wanted this to be a family thing.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.952
- Mom!
- Answer the door.

21:36.830 --> 21:38.627
I don't trust this Curtis.

21:38.698 --> 21:41.531
He's got eight million earrings,
his nose is pierced...

21:41.601 --> 21:43.296
He's no boy, he's a fishing lure.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.394
This is the business we've chosen...

21:47.440 --> 21:48.998
What do we do about him?

21:49.075 --> 21:53.808
We were supposed to be alone tonight.
I was planning to make noise.

21:55.281 --> 21:58.614
I'll send him home with Phil. It's perfect!

21:59.152 --> 22:01.382
Tonight is our night.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.048
Tonight, I'm the Energizer Bunny.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.585
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

22:16.236 --> 22:18.329
Are you relaxed now?

22:27.213 --> 22:28.612
It's time.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.751
- I'm going to change.
- Change?

22:36.189 --> 22:37.850
Into what?

22:42.595 --> 22:44.529
Your husband's out of town?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.358
- What?
- Nothing.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.494
It's just something that helps me.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.384
I'm Antonio, dance with me.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.718
Oh, baby.

23:17.463 --> 23:19.954
I look like a schmuck.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.115
What's this?

24:02.008 --> 24:04.272
What did you have in your hat, Curly?

24:22.628 --> 24:25.062
What the hell is this?

24:27.667 --> 24:30.158
"$1,000,000 in gold.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.898
"I took it, you find it. "

24:33.606 --> 24:35.039
- What the...
- Mitch!

24:37.643 --> 24:39.975
- I'm ready.
- Just a second.

24:55.128 --> 24:57.062
Happy birthday.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.087
Wow.

25:01.567 --> 25:03.592
If I scream too loud...

25:04.404 --> 25:05.632
tough.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.723
I'm done.

25:35.334 --> 25:36.824
What happened?

25:37.336 --> 25:41.500
- I just...
- There was, I think, too much anticipation.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.207
You know, and you look so great.

25:44.610 --> 25:48.842
And the kissing was great,
really wonderful, topnotch kissing, and...

25:49.982 --> 25:51.973
it's better this way.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.248
For whom?

25:55.621 --> 25:58.556
You. I mean, for us, I mean...

25:59.625 --> 26:01.490
because now...

26:04.430 --> 26:08.924
that one's out of the way, and
in 10 minutes the new shift comes on...

26:09.302 --> 26:11.634
and I'll be in total control.

26:12.038 --> 26:15.439
So, go hide in any room in the house
and I'll go look for you.

26:16.576 --> 26:19.170
- What?
- Go. It'll be great.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.579
Any room in the house.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.047
I guess I got you too excited.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.548
Go hide.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.488
I'm hiding.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.893
I don't believe this!

26:41.000 --> 26:42.627
- Mitch?
- Okay.

27:00.253 --> 27:01.880
I feel your pain.

27:01.954 --> 27:05.412
Tell me again. Last year
you buried someone you were fond of?

27:06.325 --> 27:10.056
Someone I was very fond of.
With whom I had a very good relationship.

27:10.363 --> 27:13.298
But now this dead individual
seems to be following me.

27:13.366 --> 27:15.960
- Excuse me?
- I am plotzing, I am seeing him...

27:16.035 --> 27:17.764
You listening to this nut?

27:19.338 --> 27:20.498
He's crazy.

27:20.606 --> 27:23.336
- Are you seeing him now?
- Gotta go.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.010
- 'Morning.
- Are you busy?

27:26.546 --> 27:29.515
Actually, could I talk to you for a second?

27:29.916 --> 27:30.905
What?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.712
You know what, forget about it.

27:32.785 --> 27:35.481
I love to hear about
other people's problems.

27:35.555 --> 27:37.352
Makes me feel normal.

27:38.991 --> 27:42.085
I know that this will sound crazy, but...

27:42.161 --> 27:43.651
I saw him again.

27:43.729 --> 27:45.856
- Who?
- Curly.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.294
Oh, God, Mitch.

27:48.367 --> 27:52.599
Last night in the rain, outside my window.
I ran out, but he was gone.

27:52.805 --> 27:55.035
I'm telling you, we buried him alive.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.837
He is pissed, and he wants his hat back.

27:59.545 --> 28:02.139
- I'm taking you home.
- No, let me explain.

28:02.215 --> 28:04.706
Nobody returns from the dead
for their hat.

28:04.984 --> 28:07.680
- Lf this was in it?
- This was in Curly's hat?

28:07.753 --> 28:09.721
It was sewn in the hat band.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.021
Read this.

28:12.258 --> 28:14.954
"West Pac, eat my dust.
I took it, you find it.

28:15.027 --> 28:18.656
"$1,000,000. L. Washburn. "
Who's L. Washburn?

28:18.731 --> 28:20.631
- No idea.
- What is this?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.763
I think it's a treasure map.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.030
- No kidding?
- I'm not imagining this, right?

28:25.104 --> 28:26.799
There's a piece missing.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.602
But it shows the trail
and the X where it's buried.

28:29.675 --> 28:33.771
$1,000,000! I got those Time-Life books
on the Old West...

28:33.846 --> 28:37.680
and I read there's money buried all over
that's never been found.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.750
I bet this map tells you where it's buried.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.220
Tells you where what's buried?

28:44.924 --> 28:46.653
Phil's grandmother.

28:50.630 --> 28:52.860
What's up? We're really busy.

28:54.634 --> 28:57.797
I'm going to do
a little more research on this...

28:59.438 --> 29:00.803
Grandma.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.200
Wow, this is a big office.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.773
It's not that big.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.314
"Mitch Robbins, Station Manager. "

29:12.118 --> 29:15.417
- What is it? I'm a little bit busy.
- Nothing.

29:15.488 --> 29:18.423
That's great you got Phil a job.
That's really nice.

29:18.491 --> 29:21.392
- What's it been, about five months now?
- Yeah.

29:23.562 --> 29:28.022
I called you about six months ago,
and asked if there were any openings...

29:28.467 --> 29:31.994
and you said there wasn't anything.
Then a month goes by...

29:32.438 --> 29:35.168
something opens up, and Phil gets it.

29:37.576 --> 29:40.067
My tough luck, I guess. Or bad timing.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.848
I always try to take care of you.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.484
Take care of me?

29:47.853 --> 29:50.947
Mikey, you're my kid brother,
and you take care of me?

29:51.691 --> 29:54.319
You're my kid brother.
My name is not Mikey.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.055
Send Fredo to do this,
send Fredo to do that.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.323
- I'm smart.
- Stop.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.456
I'm smart, I want respect!

30:00.533 --> 30:03.001
Would you stop with this Godfather stuff!

30:03.602 --> 30:06.196
You want to talk about this? Seriously?

30:08.474 --> 30:11.238
'Cause you have a job for a friend
and not for a brother.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.874
And don't tell me he's special, all right?

30:13.946 --> 30:16.710
I like Phil, but let's face it...

30:16.782 --> 30:19.683
he's a lamb chop short of a mixed grill.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.180
So when you say...

30:21.253 --> 30:23.847
I'll tell you something, and I'll be honest.

30:24.323 --> 30:28.054
I didn't want you to work here
because I can't count on you.

30:31.397 --> 30:35.527
I have tried to help you in the past
and you embarrassed me, frankly.

30:35.801 --> 30:38.599
- When?
- When? The ad agency thing?

30:38.804 --> 30:42.638
Bob Richardson gave you that job
as a personal favor to me.

30:42.775 --> 30:44.572
And you let him down.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.403
Bob Richardson said terrible things
about you behind your back.

30:49.682 --> 30:51.582
I had a fight with him.

30:51.717 --> 30:55.915
I said I don't care who he is,
he can't talk about my brother like that.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.252
And I refused to work there anymore.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.393
He told me you never showed up.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.932
Oh, that Bob Richardson.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.665
That guy. He...

31:16.575 --> 31:19.806
I'll just deal with the fact
that my brother thinks I'm an idiot.

31:19.879 --> 31:23.406
Don't turn this into an opera.
I don't think you're an idiot.

31:23.682 --> 31:27.140
No? Never once in your life
did you ever say you were proud of me.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.249
For what?

31:30.022 --> 31:31.011
Thanks.

31:34.960 --> 31:35.949
Damn it!

31:37.229 --> 31:39.720
Glen, wait a second. Come here.

31:39.799 --> 31:43.064
- Glen, come here.
- Let go of me, you big bully.

31:43.135 --> 31:46.070
Come here! Listen to me. I'm sorry...

31:46.238 --> 31:47.705
but you set me up for that.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.172
You've a right to feel how you feel.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.273
Would you please listen to me?

31:54.246 --> 31:57.272
Friday, I'm going to Las Vegas.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.078
There's a big convention.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.051
Why don't you come with me and Phil?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.748
I'll introduce you,
you'll meet people, make contacts.

32:03.823 --> 32:05.552
Maybe something'll come of it...

32:05.624 --> 32:08.252
if you're really looking for a serious job.

32:08.761 --> 32:11.753
- Okay?
- Hey, Mitch. Come on. I found some...

32:12.131 --> 32:13.359
Grandma.

32:13.966 --> 32:15.126
Can you loan me $10?

32:17.036 --> 32:21.166
And then it just hit me.
West Pac: Western Pacific Railroad.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.607
I'll bet you that $1,000,000
is from a train robbery.

32:24.677 --> 32:27.145
$1,000,000!

32:27.213 --> 32:30.580
A little louder, some of the crack dealers
didn't hear you. Thank you.

32:30.883 --> 32:32.612
Get you a little decaf.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.497
I got it!

32:57.877 --> 32:59.344
Look at this.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.406
"June 12, 1908."

33:02.615 --> 33:04.446
That's what it says on the map!

33:04.517 --> 33:07.645
What could Curly have to do with this?
In 1908 he wasn't born yet.

33:07.720 --> 33:11.212
Look at this.
The starting spot on the map, Spencer...

33:11.290 --> 33:14.817
it's only 65 miles from Las Vegas.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.821
This is fate!

33:16.962 --> 33:18.224
Up yours.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.495
"$1,000,000 in gold bars lost. "

33:22.101 --> 33:25.502
That was then.
Gold is 10 times more valuable now.

33:25.571 --> 33:26.868
Twenty!

33:26.939 --> 33:28.338
$20,000,000!

33:29.008 --> 33:32.409
Sorry. What am I doing?
I'm getting crazy! This is ridiculous.

33:32.478 --> 33:35.447
It's not crazy.
It's all fitting into place. Look.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.005
I got the trial of the train robbers.

33:40.286 --> 33:43.084
"Leader of the gang, Lincoln Washburn... "

33:43.856 --> 33:46.222
- L. Washburn!
- I don't believe this.

33:46.292 --> 33:50.490
"... challenged the authorities.
'I took it, you find it', he said.

33:51.096 --> 33:54.088
"So far, none of the gold
has been recovered. "

33:54.500 --> 33:57.025
None of the gold has been recovered.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.163
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.401
- Go after the gold!
- Are you serious?

34:03.776 --> 34:09.237
From Las Vegas, let's go to Spencer,
follow the map and see where it leads us!

34:09.315 --> 34:12.716
- You're getting a little excited.
- You're damn right.

34:13.085 --> 34:15.610
This could be the opportunity of a lifetime.

34:15.754 --> 34:16.982
Holy...

34:17.222 --> 34:19.918
You are out of control.
Stop and think a minute.

34:19.992 --> 34:22.290
Why would Curly keep something
like this in his hat?

34:22.360 --> 34:25.489
He couldn't take a filing cabinet
on the cattle drive.

34:26.565 --> 34:31.025
I mean, why put the map into his hat?
Why didn't he go get the treasure?

34:31.103 --> 34:33.161
Maybe he never got around to it.

34:33.237 --> 34:37.264
He never got around to it?
For $20,000,000 you'd budget your time.

34:39.545 --> 34:40.739
Mitch!

34:46.284 --> 34:51.348
When I saw this map, I got excited, too.
But we can't just go nuts. I mean, I'm 40!

34:51.790 --> 34:53.587
What does that mean?

34:53.659 --> 34:55.149
I don't know!

34:59.798 --> 35:00.992
Come on!

35:01.066 --> 35:04.126
If you showed me
what any of this has to do with Curly...

35:04.203 --> 35:07.434
then I would believe you.
Then I would say, "It's real. "

35:07.506 --> 35:09.667
But you can't. So it isn't.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.778
Meet Lincoln Washburn.

35:24.857 --> 35:27.121
Hi, honey, I'm in Las Vegas.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.984
Yeah, at the convention.

35:30.896 --> 35:34.093
We're just sitting out here
relaxing by the pool.

35:34.366 --> 35:37.335
Weather's hot, about 120...

35:37.436 --> 35:40.064
but dry, so you don't even notice it.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.801
Honey, listen, here's the thing.

35:43.142 --> 35:47.101
They had some sort of an electrical thing
at the hotel.

35:48.247 --> 35:52.581
I don't know. It was a thing.
The switchboard blew up.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.643
What the hell am I doing?

35:56.221 --> 35:58.951
No calls coming in, no calls going out.

35:59.458 --> 36:04.157
So you have to call me on the cellular,
'cause I'll have it with me every second.

36:05.097 --> 36:08.555
All right. So don't call the hotel...

36:09.301 --> 36:11.132
call me.

36:12.871 --> 36:16.272
I've got to go, honey.
We're going to see Siegfried and Roy.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.103
I love you, too. 'Bye.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.644
You lied to her.

36:25.718 --> 36:28.346
What was I going to do, tell her the truth?

36:28.420 --> 36:32.618
That I'm jeopardizing my career to rent
burros and go hunting for buried treasure?

36:32.691 --> 36:35.125
I'm sure she'd be real supportive.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.656
You know,
this whole situation drips with irony.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.227
- Does it?
- Oh, drips.

36:42.434 --> 36:47.394
What if it was my idea instead of yours?
If I was bagging my job to hunt treasure?

36:47.473 --> 36:50.704
You'd be saying,
"Same old crazy, irresponsible Glen. "

36:50.776 --> 36:54.439
But you do it and it's all right.
How do you explain that?

36:54.513 --> 36:55.775
Listen...

36:55.914 --> 36:59.577
we know it's a day and a half to the gold
and a day and a half back.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.744
We'll be back Monday, tops.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.618
Wait. Why are you
making me feel guilty about this?

37:04.690 --> 37:07.420
Shouldn't you be grateful
we included you?

37:07.493 --> 37:09.893
If it's real,
your share could be $7 million...

37:09.962 --> 37:11.589
Everything's set.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.590
Good. Where's my other friend?

37:15.768 --> 37:18.601
He's inside, settling up with my partner.

37:18.937 --> 37:22.634
That's a lot of stuff for
a couple days camping. Shovels, ropes...

37:22.741 --> 37:24.709
Well, actually...

37:24.777 --> 37:27.644
we're seismologists from Caltech.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.573
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.282
Do you know anything
about geology or earthquakes?

37:33.352 --> 37:34.341
No.

37:34.419 --> 37:38.321
Well, the continental plates
are in a state of extreme...

37:38.490 --> 37:39.957
seismic tension...

37:40.025 --> 37:43.517
throughout this entire
igneous, polygamous, Jurassic...

37:43.896 --> 37:45.454
Hasidic region.

37:45.898 --> 37:49.299
And when the plates
get in that state of tension...

37:49.368 --> 37:51.802
what we have to do is dig down...

37:52.204 --> 37:53.762
and relax them.

37:55.207 --> 37:56.367
Golly.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.905
Well put.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.843
So there's this guy's picture
in an old newspaper...

38:00.913 --> 38:03.939
and he looks just like the guy
with the map in his hat.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.984
It must have been
his father or his grandfather...

38:07.052 --> 38:10.283
but that's what convinced us
the gold is really there.

38:10.355 --> 38:11.583
Phil.

38:12.658 --> 38:17.288
I don't really believe much
in this treasure-hunting business...

38:17.429 --> 38:20.694
but I sure do wish you boys
a whole lot of luck.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.199
- We didn't want to look stupid.
- That's all right.

38:26.271 --> 38:29.638
A lot of you city boys come up here
thinking you'll dig up some gold.

38:29.708 --> 38:32.006
Hell, it keeps us in business.

38:32.077 --> 38:35.376
- Let's get started. Thank you very much.
- Oh, sure thing.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.509
- All right!
- Now, you boys be careful.

38:38.617 --> 38:43.577
Turn your boots upside down at night,
watch your step, watch where you squat.

38:45.757 --> 38:46.951
Squat?

38:47.226 --> 38:51.890
A city boy came here about a year ago.
He was squatting to do his business...

38:51.964 --> 38:54.899
a rattlesnake got him right in the keister.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.565
See you in a couple of days, I hope.

39:03.075 --> 39:05.509
Did you tell him your entire life?

39:05.611 --> 39:07.875
- Of course not, I just...
- Phil!

39:08.747 --> 39:11.841
I'd think twice before going back
to your wife.

39:11.917 --> 39:15.045
It'd be like sticking your balls
in a bear trap.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.389
That would be a bad thing, right?

39:23.762 --> 39:25.753
I'm joking, it's a joke.

39:28.767 --> 39:32.328
We should go,
'cause, look, we're in a handicapped spot.

39:38.510 --> 39:41.070
Gays in the military. Your thoughts?

39:44.316 --> 39:47.012
We'll be back
after these commercial breaks.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.916
'Bye. Let's go, boys.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.126
Good luck.

39:59.197 --> 40:01.757
Hope you find lots and lots of gold.

40:20.819 --> 40:21.945
Well?

40:22.020 --> 40:24.318
It says, "The band plays the way. "

40:24.556 --> 40:26.922
What band? What's "plays the way"?

40:26.992 --> 40:29.756
I don't know. This is very hard to read.

40:33.165 --> 40:34.928
Which way is north?

40:35.500 --> 40:36.558
Up.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.636
What do you mean, "up"?

40:38.704 --> 40:40.968
North on the map is always up.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.665
So, I guess that means...

40:43.842 --> 40:45.469
we should go up.

40:45.978 --> 40:47.240
What are you saying?

40:47.312 --> 40:51.908
Every time you go up you're going north,
and every time you go down, south?

40:54.920 --> 40:58.287
Now you're starting to frighten me.
Hold up here.

40:59.491 --> 41:04.360
Maybe you should have bought a compass
instead of four pounds of tortilla chips.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.361
Let's see.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.132
I can't make out anything here.

41:11.336 --> 41:12.803
Look at this.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.235
It's all written so small.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.707
- I know. What is this?
- I don't know.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.677
- Give me the map.
- Let Magellan have a look.

41:20.746 --> 41:23.214
Yes, some of us come prepared.

41:24.149 --> 41:26.709
Can you hold this, please? Thank you.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.810
Move, you're in my light.

41:33.458 --> 41:34.823
All right.

41:34.893 --> 41:37.521
Now, the sun sets in the east, right?

41:37.896 --> 41:40.262
No, the sun sets in the west.

41:41.366 --> 41:44.563
That's if you're in the East.
But we are way out West now...

41:44.636 --> 41:49.403
- so we are past where the sun sets.
- You can't be past where the sun sets.

41:49.474 --> 41:53.205
And if you think you can,
then I am directly south of an idiot.

41:53.278 --> 41:55.178
- Which is down.
- Right.

41:56.915 --> 42:01.079
Speaking of idiots,
it doesn't say, "The band plays the way. "

42:01.153 --> 42:03.178
It says, "The hand points the way. "

42:03.255 --> 42:05.348
That's a lot better, what does that mean?

42:08.994 --> 42:11.258
- The hand points the way.
- Yes.

42:19.838 --> 42:21.829
The hand points the way.

42:22.374 --> 42:24.137
Look, it's the hand!

42:24.209 --> 42:27.042
The hand points the way. The map is real!

42:29.114 --> 42:31.105
Look at it! Here it is!

42:31.183 --> 42:32.844
It's real!

42:33.819 --> 42:35.810
The hand points the way.

42:38.356 --> 42:39.721
All right!

42:42.360 --> 42:44.521
We're going to get the gold!

42:47.399 --> 42:48.627
What are you doing?

42:48.700 --> 42:52.101
I'm doing Walter Huston's dance
from Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

42:52.170 --> 42:56.004
Oh, yeah. He found the gold
and he did the dance. I loved it.

42:57.576 --> 42:59.601
Rich, boys. We'll be rich.

42:59.878 --> 43:00.970
It's real!

43:02.414 --> 43:04.245
The map is real!

43:04.950 --> 43:06.611
The map is on fire!

43:06.685 --> 43:08.482
- It's on fire!
- Shit!

43:09.121 --> 43:11.521
Get it. Oh, no!

43:15.894 --> 43:17.191
I got it!

43:28.240 --> 43:29.537
Watch it!

43:48.493 --> 43:49.983
Chiropractor.

43:50.529 --> 43:51.587
Twelve.

43:54.132 --> 43:55.622
Unbelievable.

43:56.401 --> 43:57.595
Also 12.

43:57.669 --> 43:59.728
- How do you do that?
- Fourteen.

44:00.238 --> 44:02.832
No, I'm really asking you,
how do you do that?

44:04.576 --> 44:08.535
I don't know, I automatically see
how many letters there are in every word.

44:08.613 --> 44:10.740
My brother, the Rain Man.

44:12.184 --> 44:13.674
Wayne Newton.

44:13.752 --> 44:14.810
Eleven.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.013
Yeah, definitely 11.

44:19.391 --> 44:20.949
Let me ask you:

44:21.026 --> 44:25.019
If I'd actually died today,
would you still be playing this game?

44:25.730 --> 44:29.166
Mitch, it's over.
You're okay. Everybody's okay.

44:29.501 --> 44:31.765
I know, I'm sorry, I'm just...

44:32.304 --> 44:36.400
I'm just a little petrified of heights,
which is why I'm not tall.

44:36.675 --> 44:38.040
Listen, Phil.

44:38.109 --> 44:42.409
I'm making you a copy of the map
in case something like this happens again.

44:44.249 --> 44:46.911
So Phil gets a copy, but not me.

44:47.786 --> 44:49.913
We don't need three copies.

44:51.523 --> 44:54.617
But why, automatically,
does Phil get the copy?

44:54.693 --> 44:56.684
Well, because...

44:59.664 --> 45:00.858
I see.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.462
- What does that mean?
- It means I see.

45:06.671 --> 45:09.367
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to bed.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.513
Listen, Phil.

45:17.882 --> 45:20.715
Is it okay with you if Glen gets the copy?

45:21.586 --> 45:23.747
- Fine.
- Thank you.

45:25.023 --> 45:28.288
I've already given him $7 million,
why not a map?

45:28.460 --> 45:32.920
Okay, here we go. I told you,
I had already invited him to Las Vegas.

45:33.198 --> 45:34.756
What could I say to him?

45:34.833 --> 45:37.529
"Stand by that roulette table,
we'll be back in three days"?

45:37.602 --> 45:38.591
It was awkward.

45:38.670 --> 45:42.037
I know he's your brother
and I know he's a nice guy...

45:42.107 --> 45:45.975
but I've got this terrible feeling
he'll do something to screw this up.

45:46.044 --> 45:48.308
He already set fire to the map.

45:48.380 --> 45:51.577
I know. I'll watch him.
I'll be responsible for him.

45:51.650 --> 45:54.551
I don't want anything to mess this up.
It's too important.

45:54.619 --> 45:57.554
Don't worry. So far, so good.
We're having a great time.

45:57.622 --> 45:59.249
I almost got killed today.

46:37.996 --> 46:39.657
I made you a map.

46:40.799 --> 46:42.061
You did?

46:42.367 --> 46:44.801
Yeah, I put it in your saddlebag.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.364
Thanks.

46:50.809 --> 46:54.540
It means a lot to me
that you brought me along on this thing.

46:54.612 --> 46:57.638
- Look, come on.
- No, I mean it, you know.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.083
It reminds me of...

47:00.685 --> 47:04.553
Remember when Mom would force you to
take me to the movies with your friends?

47:04.622 --> 47:06.089
She never forced me.

47:06.157 --> 47:10.059
She'd just say if I didn't,
she'd hang herself with the good towels.

47:14.232 --> 47:16.700
But you were really nice about it.

47:17.235 --> 47:21.001
I remember you gave me
my own personal box of Milk Duds...

47:21.072 --> 47:23.632
and you'd take me to the bathroom...

47:24.676 --> 47:26.803
during the best part of the movie.

47:27.879 --> 47:29.847
And you let me sit next to you.

47:34.719 --> 47:36.710
Can I ask you something?

47:36.788 --> 47:37.880
Sure.

47:37.956 --> 47:39.514
What do you do?

47:40.024 --> 47:41.514
What do I do?

47:41.726 --> 47:44.661
Sometimes we don't hear from you
for months.

47:46.297 --> 47:48.128
I do a lot of things.

47:48.433 --> 47:49.923
Sales, mostly.

47:51.536 --> 47:54.198
For a while I was an animal detective.

47:54.406 --> 47:59.309
What is that? A poodle calls and says,
"My wife's fooling around with a bulldog"?

48:00.845 --> 48:01.903
No.

48:02.814 --> 48:06.250
Once, by accident, I found a dog
and called the owner.

48:06.317 --> 48:08.979
He gave me $100.
So I made a business out of it.

48:09.053 --> 48:12.147
I'd find lost dogs and call the owners.
People paid big ransom.

48:12.223 --> 48:15.624
- Ransom! My God...
- "Ransom" is a bad choice of words.

48:15.960 --> 48:19.555
That's the word they used in court,
but I'm still fighting it.

48:19.631 --> 48:21.121
Good for you.

48:25.203 --> 48:27.034
There's Phil's horse.

48:28.039 --> 48:29.529
Where's Phil?

48:38.183 --> 48:40.845
- You all right?
- I'll just be a second.

48:40.919 --> 48:42.318
Yeah, right.

48:47.926 --> 48:51.020
He must be having trouble.
Relax, don't strain!

48:58.303 --> 48:59.702
Oh, my God.

49:02.307 --> 49:04.298
Too many tortilla chips.

49:04.375 --> 49:06.275
I was bit by a rattler!

49:06.377 --> 49:07.810
Mitch, help!

49:08.146 --> 49:09.408
A snake!

49:12.383 --> 49:13.748
A rattler!

49:14.185 --> 49:17.484
He bit me on the ass.
God, I'm going to die!

49:19.090 --> 49:20.114
Hold on.

49:20.191 --> 49:23.024
Somebody, suck out the poison. Please!

49:23.862 --> 49:27.764
- He's your friend.
- Yeah, but you slept with his sister.

49:27.832 --> 49:29.732
I'm losing feeling.

49:29.968 --> 49:32.698
Can't we wait till the poison travels up?

49:32.770 --> 49:35.295
I understand. Glen, suck on his ass.

49:35.373 --> 49:36.499
What?

49:36.808 --> 49:38.332
I can't speak.

49:38.510 --> 49:40.171
My tongue's numb.

49:40.245 --> 49:44.306
I've done you a million favors,
and one time I ask you to do something...

49:44.382 --> 49:48.580
And the one time is sucking poison
out of your friend's ass? Forget it!

49:48.653 --> 49:50.018
I'm blind.

49:50.722 --> 49:52.246
Where are you?

49:52.924 --> 49:54.824
I'm here, Phil.

49:55.293 --> 49:59.559
Don't worry, Phil, I'm going to do it.
But I am not going to forget this, Glen.

50:02.634 --> 50:04.261
Mitch, please...

50:04.435 --> 50:07.199
don't tell my kids I died taking a shit.

50:08.039 --> 50:09.165
Okay.

50:13.378 --> 50:14.402
Hurry.

50:21.819 --> 50:23.810
Would you suck, already?

50:29.694 --> 50:31.685
That is not a snakebite.

50:34.933 --> 50:36.764
You sat on a cactus.

50:41.739 --> 50:43.536
You sat on a cactus.

50:45.977 --> 50:50.676
I felt the sting, I saw that snake,
and I remembered what those guys said...

50:52.383 --> 50:54.510
I though I was really going to die.

50:54.586 --> 50:57.817
- It's over, you're okay.
- You were going to do it.

50:58.056 --> 51:00.456
You were going to suck on my ass.

51:00.858 --> 51:02.223
It's over.

51:02.827 --> 51:05.193
- You're my friend, Mitch.
- Sure I am.

51:05.263 --> 51:07.322
You really care about me!

51:11.302 --> 51:12.929
It's okay, Phil.

51:15.607 --> 51:17.734
He gets a little emotional.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.718
We used to be that close.

51:27.785 --> 51:29.184
Oh, God.

51:56.414 --> 51:58.211
Let's get that gold!

51:58.816 --> 52:00.716
I want that gold!

52:04.722 --> 52:07.282
"This is the business we've chosen. "

52:25.443 --> 52:28.742
Batting third, and playing center field...

52:29.013 --> 52:31.675
Number 7, Mickey Mantle.

52:34.786 --> 52:36.219
I can't see.

52:42.026 --> 52:44.290
How does the TV know what to record?

52:44.429 --> 52:47.887
Because you've told the VCR,
and once you tell the VCR...

52:47.965 --> 52:50.661
- It tells it?
- Yeah, you don't tell the TV anything.

52:50.735 --> 52:52.794
The VCR does all the work.

52:54.205 --> 52:56.765
It's a great convention, honey. I love...

52:57.041 --> 52:58.235
Hello?

53:33.544 --> 53:36.445
Phil, is this beef jerky or turkey jerky?

53:36.614 --> 53:38.241
Does it really matter?

53:38.883 --> 53:40.851
How do they make it, anyway?

53:40.952 --> 53:43.477
Jerky? It's an interesting process.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.818
Take a really good piece of meat...

53:45.890 --> 53:49.621
then a New York City cab driver
sits on it for four months.

53:53.498 --> 53:57.662
How will those two laughing idiots
we rented this stuff from feel...

53:57.735 --> 54:00.169
when we bring back all that gold?

54:01.506 --> 54:05.943
The looks on those faces,
those tobacco-chewing, gun-rack-having...

54:06.310 --> 54:11.270
chicken-screwing, sister-marrying,
abandoned-toilet-seat-in-the-yard-having...

54:11.349 --> 54:13.909
vitamin-deficiencied, ugly faces.

54:14.552 --> 54:16.850
They're behind me, aren't they?

54:18.923 --> 54:20.550
Howdy, boys.

54:25.329 --> 54:29.095
What a coincidence.
We were just talking about you.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.600
- What are you doing here?
- We followed you.

54:31.669 --> 54:35.070
Isn't that nice, huh? Talk about service.

54:35.139 --> 54:38.540
Everything is great.
The equipment, the food...

54:38.609 --> 54:42.705
That jerky, forget about it.
Better than Mom's, but she used onions...

54:42.780 --> 54:44.372
We want the map!

54:45.149 --> 54:46.173
Map?

54:46.250 --> 54:49.151
The one old Stretch there told us about.

54:49.287 --> 54:50.811
Oh, the map.

54:53.658 --> 54:58.152
Like you said, we're like all those dumb
city boys who come looking for treasure.

54:59.564 --> 55:00.588
Nope.

55:00.665 --> 55:05.159
This cowboy kept this map in his hat,
and that means it was something special.

55:05.870 --> 55:08.930
- And if his daddy did that holdup...
- We want that map!

55:09.006 --> 55:12.169
- Don't make us look for it.
- Fellas, come on now.

55:13.644 --> 55:16.579
I know what you're feeling,
I've been there.

55:17.481 --> 55:19.108
I'm still there.

55:19.350 --> 55:21.978
You feel like you have no control
over your life...

55:22.053 --> 55:24.021
that nothing makes sense...

55:24.088 --> 55:26.022
It's in the saddle bag.

55:34.565 --> 55:38.296
Come on, you can't leave us like this.
We won't make any trouble.

55:38.369 --> 55:42.863
We've got families, we've got kids.
Let us go and we'll forget the whole thing.

55:42.940 --> 55:45.033
- Absolutely.
- Not me.

55:45.109 --> 55:47.441
If I ever see either of you, I'll kill you!

55:47.511 --> 55:49.240
Will you shut up?

55:49.313 --> 55:50.575
Pig-boy!

55:57.221 --> 56:00.088
That's my wife. I really should take this.

56:00.157 --> 56:03.183
So if you'd just pull it out
and press "Send"?

56:10.101 --> 56:13.298
Looks like you won't be talking
to her after all.

56:14.839 --> 56:16.466
All right, look...

56:16.774 --> 56:18.571
you got two choices.

56:18.676 --> 56:22.442
We can leave you here, and animals
will smell your flesh burning in the sun...

56:22.513 --> 56:25.607
and will come down here
and chew you up pretty bad.

56:25.683 --> 56:26.741
Or?

56:27.051 --> 56:29.781
We can shoot you in the head right now.

56:30.922 --> 56:33.288
I think we shoot them right now.

56:33.691 --> 56:35.682
Got any last words?

57:10.494 --> 57:13.156
Curly, I knew it! You're alive!

57:16.934 --> 57:20.165
I swear, we thought you were dead.
We didn't know.

57:20.972 --> 57:22.496
Please, Curly.

57:25.076 --> 57:28.477
I'm sorry we buried you,
but you looked so dead.

57:30.381 --> 57:31.871
Sorry, Curly.

57:32.016 --> 57:33.950
I'm not Curly.

57:35.619 --> 57:36.916
I'm Duke.

57:38.189 --> 57:39.315
Duke?

57:39.557 --> 57:41.388
Curly was my brother.

57:42.460 --> 57:43.927
Your brother?

57:45.429 --> 57:46.691
Brother?

57:48.366 --> 57:49.856
The other night...

57:49.934 --> 57:52.926
it was you on the train to New Rochelle,
wasn't it?

57:53.004 --> 57:54.096
Yeah.

57:54.171 --> 57:58.335
And I was outside your window that night.
You have a lovely home.

57:58.476 --> 58:01.968
Thank you, we did a lot of work.
Where you were used to be a tool shed.

58:02.046 --> 58:04.776
The other side was a total disaster.
The wood rot...

58:04.849 --> 58:06.908
Where is my brother's map?

58:07.051 --> 58:09.451
The map. They got the map.

58:09.653 --> 58:11.314
You gave them...

58:11.389 --> 58:14.449
- You gave them my brother's map?
- No, it's okay.

58:14.525 --> 58:17.085
- They don't have the real map.
- What?

58:17.261 --> 58:20.230
What do you mean?
It's the map you gave me.

58:20.297 --> 58:23.664
I didn't make you a real copy, I changed it.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.325
- Why?
- In case something like this happened.

58:26.404 --> 58:27.996
You didn't trust me.

58:28.072 --> 58:31.940
I drew you a copy that led to the highway!
I wanted you to be safe.

58:32.009 --> 58:34.944
No! You thought I'd sneak off
and steal the gold.

58:35.012 --> 58:36.707
No, I didn't. L...

58:39.183 --> 58:41.617
Would you two pixies knock it off?

58:43.854 --> 58:46.379
Where's the damn map?

58:57.234 --> 58:59.634
What the hell are you staring at?

58:59.837 --> 59:02.635
Curly's twin, I can't get over it.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.769
Well, get over it...

59:04.842 --> 59:07.208
or I'll turn you into twins.

59:09.146 --> 59:10.511
Oh, I see.

59:14.351 --> 59:19.345
That piece was missing when we found it.
And I accidentally burned that hole.

59:23.427 --> 59:27.261
Can't tell you how often my daddy
put me and my brother on his knees...

59:27.364 --> 59:29.594
and told us about this treasure.

59:29.667 --> 59:32.761
He said we'd all go out together
when the time was ripe...

59:32.837 --> 59:36.364
- when they weren't watching him.
- Why did you wait so long?

59:36.440 --> 59:38.567
If Curly had the map, why didn't you...

59:38.642 --> 59:41.702
We didn't know there was a map
till a year ago.

59:43.881 --> 59:45.371
Our mom died.

59:46.450 --> 59:47.849
She was 95.

59:49.420 --> 59:51.354
Stabbed at a bar fight.

59:55.259 --> 59:57.750
She gave Curly the map on her deathbed.

59:57.828 --> 01:00:01.764
He wrote to me, told me to come home,
that we'd be rich.

01:00:01.832 --> 01:00:05.233
Till then,
he was going to keep it under his hat.

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:07.294
Where were you?

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:09.968
You writing a book?

01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:11.599
No.

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:15.435
By the time I got back...

01:00:15.579 --> 01:00:18.013
Curly had died on a cattle drive.

01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:22.119
Dumb son-of-a-bitch.

01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:25.584
His pal, Cookie...

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:29.957
told me that you had his hat,
so I came looking for you.

01:00:30.161 --> 01:00:31.628
Found you, didn't I?

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:35.825
Why didn't you just knock and tell me?
Why did you scare the life out of me?

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.494
Because I didn't know
what kind of guy you were.

01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:41.538
And I wasn't sure
you knew about the map.

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:43.232
If you didn't...

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.706
I sure wasn't going to tell you.

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:49.969
Then you came out here,
I figured I'd let you do all the work...

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.344
and then just take it from you.

01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:56.519
You guys ought to head back to town.

01:00:56.587 --> 01:00:58.817
Back, what do you mean, back?

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:02.387
Your mommies will be worried about you.

01:01:04.295 --> 01:01:06.058
Thanks for the map.

01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:09.930
Hey, wait a second, you can't...

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:11.991
I can't what?

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:16.134
Nothing.

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:37.222
That's it, I guess.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.737
What the hell do you want?

01:01:57.815 --> 01:02:01.216
You may look like Curly,
but you're nothing like him.

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:06.750
Curly was a good man, a decent man.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.414
He had dignity.

01:02:08.492 --> 01:02:12.155
He wouldn't like to see you
treating his friends like this.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:14.493
- You were his friend?
- Yeah.

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:16.863
As a matter of fact,
he changed my whole life.

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:20.495
I was really confused,
and he told me that one thing...

01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:23.537
He told you about that one thing?

01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:26.838
Yeah. And if he was here
and saw what you were doing...

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.378
he would kick the living shit out of you.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:33.878
So, Curly told you about the one thing.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.454
He must have liked you.

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:40.217
He did.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:49.262
You and your friends want to ride along...

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:50.800
As partners?

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:54.736
Hell, half of what's up there
is more than I'll ever need.

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:56.131
Half?

01:02:56.507 --> 01:03:00.170
You mean, you get a half
and the three of us have to split a half?

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:05.209
Which is fine. I'll go along with that.

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:08.752
Just remember something.

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:11.287
Don't mess with us, pal.
We're from New York.

01:03:16.558 --> 01:03:19.186
You ever talk to me like that again...

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.421
and I'll turn your balls...

01:03:21.596 --> 01:03:24.326
into earrings. Understand?

01:03:25.433 --> 01:03:26.798
Go for it.

01:03:33.174 --> 01:03:36.337
We're close. Less than a day.

01:03:37.846 --> 01:03:41.338
Can you hear it?
That's the gold, it's singing to us:

01:03:41.516 --> 01:03:43.211
"Come and get me. "

01:03:46.888 --> 01:03:49.550
Curly was wrong, there are two things.

01:03:50.325 --> 01:03:52.486
Whatever the hell this is...

01:03:53.128 --> 01:03:55.153
and gold.

01:03:58.233 --> 01:03:59.860
Let's go get it.

01:04:25.426 --> 01:04:30.090
Phil, you won't meet women sitting
at home reading those Time-Life books.

01:04:30.165 --> 01:04:31.757
You gotta get out, go places.

01:04:31.833 --> 01:04:34.700
If a woman wants someone like me,
she goes to the pound...

01:04:34.769 --> 01:04:37.329
and gets herself a three-legged dog.

01:04:38.173 --> 01:04:40.573
If this isn't too personal a question...

01:04:40.642 --> 01:04:43.509
when's the last time
you were with a woman?

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.477
Saturday.

01:04:46.648 --> 01:04:48.639
Saturday will be a year.

01:04:50.318 --> 01:04:52.912
If I'd known
I would have gotten you a cake.

01:04:52.987 --> 01:04:54.386
Who was she?

01:04:54.455 --> 01:04:57.754
- This girl I met on the cattle drive.
- Bonnie.

01:04:57.825 --> 01:04:59.656
Right, Bonnie. She was cute.

01:04:59.827 --> 01:05:02.022
She was really sweet, too, but...

01:05:02.096 --> 01:05:06.294
I was two weeks out of my marriage.
I was just a huge sack of tears.

01:05:06.467 --> 01:05:08.765
Wonder if I still know how to do it?

01:05:08.836 --> 01:05:12.772
Come on, it's like riding a bicycle,
only you're naked.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.833
Speaking of which, did you ever
walk in on our parents doing it?

01:05:17.145 --> 01:05:18.203
No.

01:05:18.746 --> 01:05:20.509
- Why, did you?
- Yes.

01:05:24.586 --> 01:05:26.611
- Really?
- Worst thing I've ever seen.

01:05:26.688 --> 01:05:29.054
It's a horrible thing
for a little kid to see.

01:05:29.123 --> 01:05:31.353
This was three weeks ago, in Florida.

01:05:32.227 --> 01:05:35.025
- Did you walk into the bedroom?
- It was in the kitchen.

01:05:36.564 --> 01:05:39.965
Apparently it was spontaneous,
because Pop still had his hat on...

01:05:40.034 --> 01:05:43.060
the one with fake grass and a golf ball.
It was horrible.

01:05:43.137 --> 01:05:45.901
Wax fruit flying every place, dog barking...

01:05:45.974 --> 01:05:48.772
my kids' pictures flapping up and down
on the refrigerator.

01:05:48.943 --> 01:05:51.571
- Okay, stop it.
- Pop was working hard.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.713
Enough of that, did you take the car in?

01:05:55.783 --> 01:05:57.808
I think that's beautiful.

01:05:58.119 --> 01:05:59.450
Not from my angle.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.978
Two people in love after all those years,
that's great.

01:06:03.057 --> 01:06:05.890
Great? An hour later we ate on that table.

01:06:24.612 --> 01:06:25.909
You okay?

01:06:27.715 --> 01:06:31.651
- First time on a horse in 50 years.
- What? But you're a cowboy.

01:06:33.087 --> 01:06:36.716
I was born around here,
but left when I was 15.

01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:38.619
Where did you go?

01:06:39.127 --> 01:06:40.651
World War II.

01:06:40.928 --> 01:06:43.590
Lied about my age and joined the Navy.

01:06:44.365 --> 01:06:47.129
First look at the big blue. After the war...

01:06:47.235 --> 01:06:51.103
Merchant Marine, charter boats,
anything to stay on the ocean.

01:06:53.174 --> 01:06:56.007
Been around the world 21 times.

01:06:56.911 --> 01:06:59.243
Curly loved the land.

01:06:59.347 --> 01:07:00.974
I loved the sea.

01:07:01.582 --> 01:07:03.914
So you're like surf and turf.

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.147
- You thought that was funny?
- No.

01:07:08.556 --> 01:07:10.922
I'm just thinking
what I'd like to do to you.

01:07:28.643 --> 01:07:29.667
Look at that.

01:07:31.579 --> 01:07:33.706
Look at how great he looks.

01:07:34.215 --> 01:07:35.910
Majestic, you know?

01:07:35.983 --> 01:07:39.783
I had a dream about a horse like this.
I want to ride alongside him.

01:07:39.887 --> 01:07:40.876
Why?

01:07:40.955 --> 01:07:43.583
To see what it's like
riding alongside a wild animal.

01:07:43.658 --> 01:07:45.888
It's like going on vacation with Arlene.

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.122
Come on.

01:08:59.567 --> 01:09:01.194
Where did he go?

01:09:20.321 --> 01:09:21.447
Shit!

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.653
Where did he go?

01:09:30.564 --> 01:09:31.759
Quiet.

01:09:39.573 --> 01:09:41.804
- What is that?
- It's an earthquake.

01:09:43.377 --> 01:09:44.742
Go! Go!

01:09:44.946 --> 01:09:47.413
He's got friends, get out of here!

01:09:50.017 --> 01:09:51.314
Stampede!

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:56.855
Holy shit!

01:10:06.467 --> 01:10:07.729
Go! Go!

01:10:09.937 --> 01:10:12.872
Let's head for the trees. Come on, go!

01:10:19.647 --> 01:10:21.274
Let's go, come on.

01:10:32.093 --> 01:10:33.560
Oh, no! Duke!

01:10:41.202 --> 01:10:44.035
- I lost the goddamn...
- Forget the map, come on!

01:10:44.272 --> 01:10:46.968
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- Let's get out of here!

01:10:54.615 --> 01:10:56.446
I'm going after Glen.

01:10:57.285 --> 01:10:58.411
Help!

01:11:00.988 --> 01:11:01.977
Mitch!

01:11:20.374 --> 01:11:21.363
Help!

01:11:23.411 --> 01:11:24.776
I'm coming!

01:11:27.148 --> 01:11:29.673
- Pull them up!
- Which ones?

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:32.184
Get to the front and pull them up!

01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:34.582
I can't!

01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:43.856
Mitch!

01:11:48.102 --> 01:11:49.228
One...

01:11:49.303 --> 01:11:50.463
two...

01:11:59.614 --> 01:12:00.603
Mitch!

01:12:07.455 --> 01:12:09.184
What are you doing?

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:11.917
I'm saving you, you schmuck.

01:12:19.133 --> 01:12:21.465
Glen, the wagon's coming apart!

01:12:21.769 --> 01:12:24.294
- What?
- You'll have to jump.

01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:46.822
We're coming to the edge,
you've got to jump now!

01:12:46.894 --> 01:12:48.589
- I can't!
- Jump!

01:12:48.663 --> 01:12:50.995
- I can't!
- You pain in the ass...

01:12:51.265 --> 01:12:55.463
listen to me, for once.
Get your fat ass out here, and jump now!

01:12:55.836 --> 01:12:57.599
Come on, jump...

01:12:58.372 --> 01:12:59.566
now!

01:13:03.477 --> 01:13:06.742
- Mitch, do something!
- Hold on!

01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:58.330
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:00.634 --> 01:14:02.101
Are you okay?

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:03.759
Yeah.

01:14:08.309 --> 01:14:10.038
You can let go now.

01:14:11.712 --> 01:14:12.804
Soon.

01:14:35.369 --> 01:14:37.064
You saved my life!

01:14:37.938 --> 01:14:40.839
You are amazing!
And the way you did it...

01:14:42.409 --> 01:14:46.243
This is a whole lot different
than just sucking on Phil's ass.

01:14:48.516 --> 01:14:49.847
Excuse me?

01:14:51.218 --> 01:14:52.845
Did I hear right?

01:14:53.187 --> 01:14:56.748
- Yeah, Phil thought that a snake bit him...
- I don't care.

01:14:59.193 --> 01:15:01.218
Now, whatever went on before...

01:15:01.595 --> 01:15:03.256
stops now.

01:15:06.467 --> 01:15:08.401
Is this real bad?

01:15:08.769 --> 01:15:10.361
It looks like...

01:15:10.604 --> 01:15:13.300
you spent the night
with a Singapore hooker.

01:15:13.374 --> 01:15:15.001
Great, that's it.

01:15:18.112 --> 01:15:19.374
I'm dead.

01:15:19.446 --> 01:15:22.643
- They're just scratches.
- No, you don't get it.

01:15:22.983 --> 01:15:24.712
Barbara can't reach me.

01:15:24.785 --> 01:15:27.049
By now, she's called the hotel in Vegas...

01:15:27.121 --> 01:15:31.182
and realized that I've been lying to her.
Then I return with scratches on my back?

01:15:31.258 --> 01:15:33.123
That's it, it is over. I'm divorced.

01:15:33.194 --> 01:15:37.062
By this time next week,
I'll be having a candlelit dinner with Phil.

01:15:37.131 --> 01:15:40.157
Well, pick a night, 'cause the map is gone.

01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:46.106
Everything's been trampled:
The food, tents, sleeping bags...

01:15:46.173 --> 01:15:47.640
What's left?

01:15:47.741 --> 01:15:50.733
Three miner's helmets
and a tube of Chap Stick.

01:15:50.811 --> 01:15:52.676
What's the difference?

01:15:53.781 --> 01:15:56.614
The only thing that mattered
was that map.

01:16:04.024 --> 01:16:06.458
- This is all my fault.
- Your fault?

01:16:06.927 --> 01:16:08.394
I dropped it.

01:16:08.462 --> 01:16:12.228
You wouldn't have,
if I hadn't frolicked with some stallion.

01:16:15.102 --> 01:16:16.694
I'm sorry, Duke.

01:16:17.037 --> 01:16:18.664
I'm really sorry.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:24.604
If we don't get lost, will we make it
back to town before we starve to death?

01:16:25.112 --> 01:16:27.672
It's only a day and a half.
I can use every second...

01:16:27.748 --> 01:16:30.148
to think of another lie to tell Barbara.

01:16:31.185 --> 01:16:33.050
If you guys go home...

01:16:33.354 --> 01:16:36.084
I'm not splitting the treasure with you.

01:16:36.156 --> 01:16:40.786
- What? You're not coming back with us?
- No. The gold is that way.

01:16:40.861 --> 01:16:45.093
Yes, but the grand-slam pancake breakfast
at the Mirage is that way.

01:16:45.332 --> 01:16:47.232
Duke, we've got no map.

01:16:47.835 --> 01:16:51.066
What will you do? Wander around
hoping to stumble onto the gold?

01:16:51.138 --> 01:16:52.366
Something like that.

01:16:52.439 --> 01:16:55.840
Please don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

01:16:56.410 --> 01:17:00.312
Insane is coming this far
and then just going back.

01:17:04.385 --> 01:17:07.013
If you guys want to go home, go ahead.

01:17:07.855 --> 01:17:09.482
But, that gold...

01:17:13.127 --> 01:17:15.652
That's the only dream I've got left.

01:17:21.402 --> 01:17:23.495
"Over the buffalo's back...

01:17:23.771 --> 01:17:26.001
"and under the frozen people. "

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.432
What?

01:17:28.742 --> 01:17:31.575
"Over the buffalo's back
and under the frozen people! "

01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:33.135
That's the rest of the map.

01:17:34.848 --> 01:17:38.045
How do you know?
You never even saw the real map.

01:17:38.118 --> 01:17:42.248
I saw it yesterday for a minute
when we were looking for the hand.

01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:48.086
This isn't memorizing a movie, or
telling how many letters are in "falafel".

01:17:48.162 --> 01:17:50.187
Seven. Now, I'm telling you...

01:17:50.264 --> 01:17:52.698
that gold will be in our hands
by tomorrow night.

01:17:52.766 --> 01:17:54.700
I can draw you the exact map.

01:17:54.768 --> 01:17:58.067
I can get us there.
All you have to do is trust me.

01:18:01.141 --> 01:18:02.631
Mitch, please...

01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:04.678
for once in your life...

01:18:05.379 --> 01:18:06.869
just trust me.

01:18:21.695 --> 01:18:23.026
Trust you?

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.864
Are you sure it said, "buffalo's back"?

01:18:28.936 --> 01:18:32.337
We haven't seen anything
that looks like a buffalo's back. Nothing.

01:18:32.406 --> 01:18:33.600
You know something?

01:18:33.674 --> 01:18:36.234
You have not stopped whining
since we started.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:39.302
It's like going on vacation
with an ambulance.

01:18:39.413 --> 01:18:42.109
Shut up! You shouldn't even be on this!

01:18:42.916 --> 01:18:46.181
Yeah? If it wasn't for me,
we wouldn't even be here.

01:18:46.286 --> 01:18:47.947
Freezing to death!

01:18:49.423 --> 01:18:51.288
Hurry, it's going out!

01:18:57.531 --> 01:18:59.294
That's the last one.

01:19:06.507 --> 01:19:07.872
Good night.

01:19:07.941 --> 01:19:11.433
Good night? How about good-bye?
We're going to die up here.

01:19:11.512 --> 01:19:13.173
The sun's up in...

01:19:13.547 --> 01:19:14.912
five hours.

01:19:15.582 --> 01:19:18.517
Tomorrow morning
we're all going to be rich.

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:28.521
Hey, look, guys...

01:19:28.595 --> 01:19:30.790
we're really in trouble here.

01:19:33.567 --> 01:19:35.592
In case we never find our way out...

01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:37.330
and I die first...

01:19:38.972 --> 01:19:40.166
eat me.

01:19:42.476 --> 01:19:43.670
Eat you?

01:19:44.778 --> 01:19:46.905
I mean, if you're starving to death.

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:50.416
Eat you? I don't even like
talking to you on the phone.

01:19:50.484 --> 01:19:54.113
I'm willing to sacrifice myself
for the good of the group.

01:19:54.421 --> 01:19:55.683
"Eat me"?

01:19:56.023 --> 01:19:58.287
What a lovely image: "Eat me. "

01:19:58.358 --> 01:20:00.792
Glen, I'm still hungry.
Is there any more Phil?

01:20:00.861 --> 01:20:02.522
Pass the Phil.

01:20:03.497 --> 01:20:05.192
He's even good cold!

01:20:05.265 --> 01:20:07.825
Great party, thanks to Phil.

01:20:09.403 --> 01:20:11.428
All right, so don't eat me.

01:20:11.538 --> 01:20:15.304
Jesus Christ!
What a bunch of little pisspots.

01:20:24.685 --> 01:20:28.143
Maybe if we huddled together,
we could share our body warmth.

01:20:28.222 --> 01:20:31.658
I read in my Time-Life book
people can survive that way.

01:20:31.758 --> 01:20:34.283
I mean, we're three 98.6s.

01:20:34.828 --> 01:20:36.796
How much is that, Glen?

01:20:36.864 --> 01:20:39.799
295.8. That's too hot.

01:20:41.368 --> 01:20:43.336
So, what are you saying?

01:20:43.637 --> 01:20:45.366
Well, I'm saying...

01:20:45.973 --> 01:20:47.463
we should hug.

01:20:48.242 --> 01:20:49.607
All night?

01:20:51.378 --> 01:20:52.367
Yeah.

01:20:55.249 --> 01:20:56.307
Okay.

01:20:57.651 --> 01:20:59.141
Come on, Glen.

01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:12.257
Easy.

01:21:19.239 --> 01:21:21.605
Hold still. I'm trying to sleep.

01:21:27.714 --> 01:21:29.204
You know what?

01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:31.915
It is a little warmer.

01:21:37.424 --> 01:21:38.755
Hey, guys?

01:21:40.694 --> 01:21:42.286
What about Duke?

01:21:43.063 --> 01:21:44.587
What about him?

01:21:46.066 --> 01:21:47.966
Shouldn't we invite...

01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:51.297
- invite him to...
- To what? To join us?

01:21:51.605 --> 01:21:54.039
- What are you, crazy?
- Look at him.

01:21:54.775 --> 01:21:56.242
He could die.

01:21:57.611 --> 01:21:59.238
This isn't right.

01:22:00.914 --> 01:22:02.279
Who's going to ask him?

01:22:05.118 --> 01:22:08.315
- You've been getting along with him best.
- Don't make me do this.

01:22:08.388 --> 01:22:09.582
Go.

01:22:10.757 --> 01:22:12.247
Save my place.

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:20.792
Duke?

01:22:21.568 --> 01:22:24.264
- Yeah.
- The guys and I were wondering...

01:22:24.338 --> 01:22:27.330
if you'd like to come back
to our place and...

01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:30.336
you know, maybe we could all...

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.504
All what?

01:22:36.883 --> 01:22:37.872
Hug.

01:22:39.286 --> 01:22:40.548
Holy God.

01:22:40.721 --> 01:22:43.849
- I'm up here with a goddamn musical.
- No.

01:22:45.592 --> 01:22:47.321
What I meant was...

01:22:49.162 --> 01:22:50.652
body warmth.

01:22:50.864 --> 01:22:53.560
And if we press against each other...

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:58.768
Come on, you could die up here.

01:22:58.939 --> 01:23:00.099
Maybe.

01:23:05.679 --> 01:23:06.941
Curly...

01:23:07.614 --> 01:23:09.241
ever mention me?

01:23:09.616 --> 01:23:12.710
Well, Curly wasn't really
what you'd call gabby.

01:23:13.654 --> 01:23:17.385
He wasn't that chatterbox
that you remember from your youth.

01:23:18.292 --> 01:23:21.819
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Oh, God, long ago.

01:23:22.562 --> 01:23:24.655
But when you have a twin...

01:23:24.731 --> 01:23:27.666
you see him every time
you look in the mirror.

01:23:29.369 --> 01:23:32.497
Sometimes you don't know
what you have, until...

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.338
Till you don't have it anymore.

01:23:35.809 --> 01:23:37.800
I liked having a brother.

01:23:40.781 --> 01:23:42.146
Did Curly...

01:23:42.716 --> 01:23:44.081
die happy?

01:23:45.252 --> 01:23:46.742
Does anybody?

01:23:49.456 --> 01:23:51.287
Well, I think he did.

01:23:51.758 --> 01:23:56.627
One of the last things he said to me was,
"There's nothing like bringing in a herd".

01:23:56.697 --> 01:23:59.495
It must be how you feel
when you're at sea.

01:24:00.133 --> 01:24:03.432
I lost my boat in a squall
about two years ago.

01:24:03.503 --> 01:24:05.095
Half-squall.

01:24:05.172 --> 01:24:08.733
I just wasn't a good enough sailor,
so I came ashore.

01:24:10.544 --> 01:24:12.535
What have you been doing since?

01:24:12.612 --> 01:24:14.637
A friend of mine's son...

01:24:15.349 --> 01:24:20.150
opened a seafood restaurant in San Diego,
The Happy Pirate.

01:24:21.188 --> 01:24:23.622
- I work there.
- You're the manager?

01:24:25.692 --> 01:24:27.592
I am the happy pirate.

01:24:27.761 --> 01:24:30.161
Bird on my shoulder, pirate hat...

01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:32.027
one hand's a hook.

01:24:32.232 --> 01:24:35.292
"How would you like
your burger cooked, matey? "

01:24:37.671 --> 01:24:41.698
Sometimes I can't stand it, I want
to spit in their goddamn clam chowder.

01:24:41.775 --> 01:24:44.107
I've been a sailor for 50 years.

01:24:44.177 --> 01:24:46.145
I don't know how to do anything else.

01:24:46.213 --> 01:24:47.840
I'd just be lost.

01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:51.449
Mitch, I...

01:24:52.119 --> 01:24:54.212
I've got to find that gold.

01:24:54.821 --> 01:24:56.448
I need that gold.

01:25:37.164 --> 01:25:40.190
Guys, come on. Are you all right?

01:25:40.667 --> 01:25:43.465
You all right? Come on, wake up.

01:25:44.371 --> 01:25:46.805
Guys, we made it! We're alive.

01:25:47.507 --> 01:25:49.270
Come on, we did it.

01:25:49.342 --> 01:25:50.934
Come on, get up.

01:25:51.445 --> 01:25:53.310
All right, now listen.

01:25:53.613 --> 01:25:56.844
This is it. This is finished.
We're going back.

01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:59.181
Listen, no arguments, Glen.

01:25:59.252 --> 01:26:01.447
We'll never survive another night like this.

01:26:01.521 --> 01:26:04.081
- You got no argument here. Let's just go.
- Right.

01:26:04.157 --> 01:26:06.022
We'd better tell Duke.

01:26:07.694 --> 01:26:09.093
Where is he?

01:26:10.497 --> 01:26:13.398
You guys pack up, I'll go find him.
Come on.

01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:18.697
Duke?

01:26:39.559 --> 01:26:40.753
Oh, no.

01:26:41.328 --> 01:26:42.761
Not him, too.

01:26:43.296 --> 01:26:46.595
What is with this family?
Everybody dies sitting up?

01:26:47.367 --> 01:26:49.733
You wouldn't hug us, you big dope!

01:26:51.371 --> 01:26:54.534
You thought I was dead, didn't you?
What do you want?

01:26:54.608 --> 01:26:55.905
Listen, Duke...

01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:59.909
I know what this treasure means to you,
but we're going back.

01:27:01.581 --> 01:27:03.572
You mean, back that way?

01:27:05.085 --> 01:27:09.545
- Over the buffalo's back?
- What buffalo's back? There isn't any!

01:27:09.623 --> 01:27:13.423
There's a buffalo's back down there.
Here, look through this.

01:27:13.994 --> 01:27:15.552
Look down there.

01:27:16.663 --> 01:27:19.928
We crossed it in the dark
and didn't even know it.

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.031
Glen was right.

01:27:22.102 --> 01:27:24.366
He was also right about the frozen people.

01:27:24.437 --> 01:27:26.905
- How do you know?
- Look down there.

01:27:28.475 --> 01:27:30.238
I don't believe it.

01:27:32.078 --> 01:27:33.773
That's gold, buddy.

01:27:36.483 --> 01:27:38.815
Are you still going to go back?

01:27:42.122 --> 01:27:44.022
Give me this. Go get everyone.

01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:45.819
Look at them! Guys!

01:27:49.362 --> 01:27:51.296
We're going to be rich!

01:28:04.444 --> 01:28:07.607
"Come and get me. Come and get me. "

01:28:19.125 --> 01:28:22.686
This could be it.
There's an entrance to a cave. Come on.

01:28:26.833 --> 01:28:28.494
Come on, let's go.

01:28:36.242 --> 01:28:37.971
I can't believe it.

01:28:44.651 --> 01:28:47.381
- Where's the stuff?
- Get it. Put it down.

01:28:55.795 --> 01:28:57.490
Where do we go now?

01:28:57.564 --> 01:29:01.557
I'll bet that's what was
on the corner of the map that's missing.

01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:05.668
What's the matter, Duke?
Do you see something?

01:29:05.739 --> 01:29:06.899
Quiet.

01:29:07.841 --> 01:29:10.071
My daddy was in this cave.

01:29:11.378 --> 01:29:13.642
- How can you tell?
- I just can.

01:29:14.247 --> 01:29:17.705
Sure, like we could always tell
when our dad had been in the bathroom.

01:29:18.618 --> 01:29:20.381
There are a lot of passageways.

01:29:21.388 --> 01:29:24.414
- Let's split up and each take one.
- Alone?

01:29:26.559 --> 01:29:28.322
I'll take this one.

01:29:33.099 --> 01:29:34.327
Hey, Mitch...

01:29:34.601 --> 01:29:37.866
what if the cave is booby-trapped?

01:29:38.738 --> 01:29:43.004
You go down the wrong passageway
and you get your head chopped off?

01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:46.868
Or a huge boulder comes rolling at you,
and it crushes your head?

01:29:46.946 --> 01:29:48.914
Would you shut up? Stop it!

01:29:48.982 --> 01:29:51.883
Why did you have to say
something like that?

01:29:53.386 --> 01:29:56.878
Look at this. There's three tunnels.
What do we do now?

01:30:00.627 --> 01:30:03.357
Okay, Glen, take the one in the middle.

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:05.320
I'll take this one...

01:30:05.398 --> 01:30:07.366
and you take that. Okay?

01:31:14.567 --> 01:31:16.933
Will you guys shut up?

01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:32.545
Don't do that now.

01:31:38.057 --> 01:31:40.048
Come on!

01:31:40.126 --> 01:31:41.457
Thank you.

01:32:50.697 --> 01:32:52.096
- Find anything?
- No, you?

01:32:52.165 --> 01:32:53.826
Yeah, I found you.

01:32:57.904 --> 01:33:00.134
- Can you hear something?
- Yeah.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.374
It sounds like a train.

01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:03.971
A train?

01:33:04.077 --> 01:33:06.409
Hey, look, there's some tracks.

01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:19.815
- Is something coming?
- I don't know.

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:22.889
Here's how you tell.

01:33:28.368 --> 01:33:30.165
What are you doing?

01:33:30.236 --> 01:33:32.431
I'm listening for vibrations.

01:33:36.609 --> 01:33:38.668
Yeah, something's coming.

01:33:42.415 --> 01:33:45.509
And it's definitely coming
from that direction.

01:33:58.264 --> 01:33:59.231
That was Mitch.

01:34:11.744 --> 01:34:13.211
Are you okay?

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:16.844
- I'm all right.
- Where are you?

01:34:18.017 --> 01:34:20.383
- Follow the tracks.
- I got it.

01:34:50.216 --> 01:34:51.376
Hello.

01:35:12.705 --> 01:35:14.104
I found it.

01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:16.607
I found it.

01:35:18.678 --> 01:35:19.736
Guys!

01:35:20.213 --> 01:35:21.840
I found the gold.

01:35:26.686 --> 01:35:29.849
"Man, what a gold rush. I found the gold.

01:35:29.922 --> 01:35:32.516
"It's mine, I tell you. It's all my gold.

01:35:32.759 --> 01:35:36.786
"We don't have to show him
no stinking badges. I found the gold! "

01:35:38.498 --> 01:35:39.863
Down here!

01:35:41.901 --> 01:35:44.631
- Where is it?
- He found it?

01:35:44.704 --> 01:35:46.194
Guys, I found the gold!

01:35:46.272 --> 01:35:47.796
Let me see it!

01:35:58.584 --> 01:36:00.552
Can I just say one thing?

01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:01.951
We're rich!

01:36:08.494 --> 01:36:10.462
We did it!

01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:13.055
What the hell is going on?

01:36:13.733 --> 01:36:16.327
Duke, we found it! We found the gold.

01:36:17.503 --> 01:36:18.765
You did?

01:36:19.605 --> 01:36:22.631
- Over here, Duke.
- Holy shit!

01:36:26.212 --> 01:36:28.373
You found the gold? Holy...

01:36:38.458 --> 01:36:42.451
Stand back, boys.
It is time for the Walter Huston dance.

01:36:45.832 --> 01:36:49.529
- Hey, Duke, no more happy pirate.
- That's right, no more.

01:36:51.404 --> 01:36:54.168
You believe this guy?
Last night he wouldn't even hug me!

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.037
See how the money makes a difference?

01:37:03.783 --> 01:37:06.581
Let's go get the burros
and start loading this stuff up.

01:37:06.652 --> 01:37:08.313
Stop right there.

01:37:08.454 --> 01:37:11.355
Did you really think
we'd let you take the gold out of here?

01:37:11.424 --> 01:37:14.188
- Thanks for doing all the work.
- I don't believe this.

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:17.229
- How the hell did you follow us, Pig-boy?
- Never mind that.

01:37:17.296 --> 01:37:20.993
It's our gold now,
and I'm afraid we can't leave witnesses.

01:37:35.114 --> 01:37:38.083
Get the gun! Quick!

01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:55.060
Mitch!

01:37:56.335 --> 01:37:57.427
Glen!

01:38:14.987 --> 01:38:17.285
It's better this way, isn't it?

01:38:17.557 --> 01:38:20.048
It's better it's me instead of you.

01:38:20.426 --> 01:38:23.088
This way Barbara and the kids...

01:38:26.499 --> 01:38:28.967
I'm sorry I wasn't a good brother.

01:38:29.402 --> 01:38:30.926
No, I'm sorry.

01:38:31.604 --> 01:38:36.200
Don't worry, we'll get some help.
Hold on, we'll get some help, you'll see.

01:38:36.576 --> 01:38:38.476
Somebody get some help!

01:38:39.111 --> 01:38:40.601
Get some help!

01:38:41.547 --> 01:38:44.038
It's okay. You always helped me.

01:38:45.685 --> 01:38:47.710
You took me to the movies.

01:38:49.789 --> 01:38:51.188
It's funny...

01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:53.588
it doesn't even hurt.

01:38:55.695 --> 01:38:56.787
Glen?

01:39:13.112 --> 01:39:17.845
You killed him! You son of a bitch!
You killed my best friend's brother!

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:25.017
These aren't real bullets. These are blanks.

01:39:26.058 --> 01:39:27.184
What?

01:39:30.963 --> 01:39:32.624
These are blanks.

01:39:33.032 --> 01:39:34.158
Here.

01:39:35.334 --> 01:39:37.996
- It's paint!
- What the hell is going on?

01:39:39.071 --> 01:39:41.198
- That's funny!
- Yeah, real funny.

01:39:42.275 --> 01:39:44.140
Hey, who's down there?

01:39:46.646 --> 01:39:50.207
What in the name of John Wayne's ass
is going on in here?

01:39:50.616 --> 01:39:53.380
Clay Stone? From the cattle drive?

01:39:53.786 --> 01:39:56.482
I remember you two. What are you doing?

01:39:59.859 --> 01:40:01.918
Great buckets of bullshit!

01:40:03.162 --> 01:40:05.426
It's Curly, come back to life.

01:40:06.032 --> 01:40:08.557
I'm not Curly, I'm his brother, Duke.

01:40:08.701 --> 01:40:10.293
Who the hell are you?

01:40:10.369 --> 01:40:13.361
I'm Clay Stone.
Hell, I've been looking for you for months.

01:40:14.807 --> 01:40:17.503
- What did you do to my boys?
- Your boys?

01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:21.437
- What happened? We heard shots.
- Is everybody all right?

01:40:21.981 --> 01:40:23.972
Ira and Barry Shalowitz?

01:40:24.617 --> 01:40:26.517
Mitch? Phil?

01:40:28.287 --> 01:40:29.754
What are you doing here?

01:40:29.822 --> 01:40:33.690
Oh, God, it's Curly!
He's come back from the dead.

01:40:33.759 --> 01:40:35.249
He looks great.

01:40:35.328 --> 01:40:37.421
It's Duke, Curly's brother.

01:40:37.496 --> 01:40:39.828
Will somebody please...

01:40:39.999 --> 01:40:42.024
tell me what the hell is going on here?

01:40:42.101 --> 01:40:44.331
- Didn't Curly tell you?
- No!

01:40:44.403 --> 01:40:45.927
Hell, it was his idea.

01:40:46.005 --> 01:40:48.803
We take folks
on a real Western treasure hunt.

01:40:48.874 --> 01:40:51.775
Follow right in the steps
of the old Washburn gang.

01:40:51.844 --> 01:40:54.813
Yeah, we get these maps,
and we follow these clues...

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.609
It's been exciting.

01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:58.510
It's been great.

01:40:58.584 --> 01:41:00.882
Better than those cattle drives.
Yes, sir-ee.

01:41:02.288 --> 01:41:04.882
More fun. You don't have
to watch where you step.

01:41:04.957 --> 01:41:08.085
Yeah, but we actually found it.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:10.958
Yes, and it belongs to us.

01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:12.190
What, that?

01:41:12.264 --> 01:41:15.859
Everybody finds that.
Hell, that's just lead painted with gold.

01:41:15.935 --> 01:41:18.563
Just to make it a little bit more fun.

01:41:19.338 --> 01:41:21.329
Take a look for yourself.

01:41:25.644 --> 01:41:27.771
Then, to give it extra goose...

01:41:27.847 --> 01:41:30.179
the boys come in, pretend to rob them...

01:41:30.249 --> 01:41:32.444
and shoot them with paint pellets.

01:41:32.518 --> 01:41:34.713
Scares the Evian out of them.

01:41:38.190 --> 01:41:40.420
Then there's no real treasure?

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.052
Curly came up here a lot of times,
but he never found anything.

01:41:45.131 --> 01:41:47.725
But he wrote to me,
said we were going to be rich.

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:51.065
I don't know about being rich,
but you make a damn good living.

01:41:51.137 --> 01:41:53.071
He wanted to cut you in for a piece.

01:41:53.139 --> 01:41:55.699
As far as I'm concerned,
you can have his share.

01:41:59.178 --> 01:42:00.975
That's what he meant?

01:42:02.047 --> 01:42:03.514
I believe so.

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:11.281
You boys came up here
thinking that this was real?

01:42:18.063 --> 01:42:19.052
Yeah.

01:42:23.402 --> 01:42:25.336
Unbelievable.

01:42:34.914 --> 01:42:37.007
Un-by-God-believable!

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:42.581
- Ready?
- I'm wound.

01:42:47.693 --> 01:42:48.955
I got it.

01:42:51.263 --> 01:42:53.527
We're Barry and Ira Shalowitz.

01:42:55.935 --> 01:42:58.062
We helped bury your brother.

01:43:01.006 --> 01:43:03.736
Maybe someday I can do the same for you.

01:43:09.081 --> 01:43:11.345
Well, it was nice meeting you.

01:43:13.786 --> 01:43:16.516
You start a conversation with,
"We buried your brother"?

01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:18.921
- I was flustered.
- It's impolite.

01:43:18.991 --> 01:43:21.824
Come on, let's get a cold beverage and...

01:43:21.894 --> 01:43:23.691
- Going somewhere?
- No.

01:43:25.197 --> 01:43:29.497
I'll take Clay's sons down
and show them where we left our horses.

01:43:29.568 --> 01:43:31.092
We'll help you.

01:43:31.170 --> 01:43:34.003
I can do it.
You guys got to go to Las Vegas.

01:43:34.073 --> 01:43:36.098
I don't got to go nowhere.

01:43:39.912 --> 01:43:43.177
What are you going to do, Duke?
Work for Clay Stone?

01:43:43.249 --> 01:43:47.083
Come up here every week
and find a fake treasure? No, thanks.

01:43:50.589 --> 01:43:52.386
So what will you do?

01:43:53.259 --> 01:43:54.692
That gold...

01:43:56.195 --> 01:43:58.459
That gold is up here somewhere.

01:43:58.531 --> 01:44:01.056
- Duke...
- No, it's up here somewhere.

01:44:07.072 --> 01:44:08.539
Thanks for...

01:44:08.707 --> 01:44:10.766
being Curly's last friend.

01:44:11.544 --> 01:44:13.273
It was my pleasure.

01:44:14.146 --> 01:44:15.670
Okay, come on.

01:44:16.015 --> 01:44:17.539
Come on, baby.

01:44:21.186 --> 01:44:24.678
Did Curly ever tell you
what that one thing was?

01:44:26.625 --> 01:44:30.152
He said that's what
you have to figure out for yourself.

01:44:32.798 --> 01:44:33.856
God.

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.233
He was a real pain in the ass, wasn't he?

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:56.984
- About five minutes.
- Good.

01:44:57.723 --> 01:44:59.884
Well, how stupid do we feel?

01:45:00.659 --> 01:45:02.650
I don't feel that stupid.

01:45:03.195 --> 01:45:06.358
- Then you're stupid.
- No, I'm confused.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.935
- Why don't I feel worse?
- I don't know.

01:45:12.338 --> 01:45:14.499
Think about it for a second.

01:45:14.907 --> 01:45:17.000
How bad do you really feel?

01:45:20.245 --> 01:45:23.339
I don't know.
You know, not as bad as I should.

01:45:26.151 --> 01:45:28.346
I feel pretty good, actually.

01:45:29.655 --> 01:45:31.088
Why is that?

01:45:31.857 --> 01:45:34.223
Well, we had a great adventure...

01:45:34.293 --> 01:45:37.353
we weren't killed,
which is always a feature I like.

01:45:37.429 --> 01:45:40.956
- And we found a box full of lead.
- That's not how I look at it.

01:45:41.033 --> 01:45:43.331
I mean, you guys saved my life.

01:45:44.803 --> 01:45:47.601
I mean, you stepped in front of a bullet.

01:45:48.707 --> 01:45:51.301
You jumped on a guy
who was ready to shoot me.

01:45:51.377 --> 01:45:54.369
- They were blanks.
- But you didn't know that.

01:45:54.446 --> 01:45:57.415
We didn't have any guided tour
or box lunches.

01:45:57.483 --> 01:45:59.713
All we had was each other.

01:46:01.086 --> 01:46:02.678
And we made it.

01:46:03.222 --> 01:46:04.314
Me...

01:46:04.623 --> 01:46:06.284
my best friend...

01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:09.684
and my brother.

01:46:12.064 --> 01:46:14.362
We found the Washburn treasure!

01:46:15.768 --> 01:46:17.065
We did it.

01:46:18.404 --> 01:46:20.133
We found that gold!

01:46:21.974 --> 01:46:23.441
Philly-boy...

01:46:23.942 --> 01:46:25.432
you did great.

01:46:26.879 --> 01:46:28.039
Thanks.

01:46:36.455 --> 01:46:38.423
I'm really proud of you.

01:47:20.232 --> 01:47:22.166
God, look at this town!

01:47:23.268 --> 01:47:25.498
Filled with desperate people.

01:47:27.272 --> 01:47:29.638
Why do you think they come here?

01:47:29.708 --> 01:47:34.236
Well, the buffets are lovely.
There's $3.95 all-you-can-eat.

01:47:34.313 --> 01:47:37.009
They want to hit the jackpot, get rich.

01:47:38.884 --> 01:47:41.648
Listen, I feel bad for you, I really do.

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:45.281
But could we talk about this later?
Maybe have a drink together?

01:47:45.357 --> 01:47:48.485
My wife is coming in from the airport
right now.

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.152
I told her everything...

01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:53.721
and I planned this fabulous evening
of being yelled at.

01:47:53.899 --> 01:47:55.389
I understand.

01:47:55.567 --> 01:47:57.899
I came back...

01:47:59.071 --> 01:48:01.665
to tell you that I know what this is.

01:48:05.410 --> 01:48:06.934
It's honesty...

01:48:08.347 --> 01:48:09.837
integrity.

01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:13.113
Great, that's great.

01:48:13.185 --> 01:48:15.745
So, listen, thanks for scaring me...

01:48:15.821 --> 01:48:17.311
and maybe...

01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:19.252
Honesty.

01:48:22.261 --> 01:48:23.489
Gotcha.

01:48:28.433 --> 01:48:30.094
You know, Mitch...

01:48:30.335 --> 01:48:32.326
right down to the end...

01:48:34.306 --> 01:48:37.434
I was planning
to cheat you and your friends.

01:48:41.947 --> 01:48:44.245
I was going to find the gold...

01:48:44.316 --> 01:48:46.841
then I was going to say I didn't find it...

01:48:46.919 --> 01:48:49.353
and after you guys had gone,
I was going...

01:48:49.421 --> 01:48:52.857
I was going to have it all, all to myself.

01:48:54.626 --> 01:48:55.820
Only...

01:48:57.462 --> 01:48:59.089
I couldn't do it.

01:48:59.164 --> 01:49:01.496
Of course not, because it isn't up there.

01:49:01.567 --> 01:49:03.797
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

01:49:04.069 --> 01:49:06.333
Curly was up there a million times.

01:49:06.405 --> 01:49:07.838
My mother...

01:49:07.906 --> 01:49:11.137
didn't want either of us
to find that treasure without the other.

01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:14.543
She wanted her boys
to do something together.

01:49:17.716 --> 01:49:20.207
So she gave Curly the map...

01:49:23.755 --> 01:49:25.245
Wait a minute.

01:49:29.928 --> 01:49:32.226
She sent me the missing corner.

01:49:36.768 --> 01:49:37.928
There.

01:49:38.003 --> 01:49:39.493
Look at that.

01:49:47.379 --> 01:49:49.006
"Hot on my trail.

01:49:49.481 --> 01:49:51.312
"Re-buried here, 1909.

01:49:53.118 --> 01:49:54.608
"L. Washburn. "

01:49:58.490 --> 01:50:00.583
Did you draw this yourself?

01:50:00.659 --> 01:50:02.456
Is that what you did?

01:50:03.262 --> 01:50:06.857
You prankster. You scamp.
You little ruffian.

01:50:06.932 --> 01:50:10.629
Forget it. I'm not going back up there.
There's nothing there.

01:50:10.702 --> 01:50:15.105
I'm through hunting for treasure.
What am I, one of the Little Rascals?

01:50:19.211 --> 01:50:21.702
What do you think of that, Spanky?

01:50:24.816 --> 01:50:26.147
This is...

01:50:32.691 --> 01:50:34.625
It's got friends.

01:50:40.766 --> 01:50:43.428
"Come and get me. Come and get me. "
