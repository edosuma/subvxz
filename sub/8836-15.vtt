I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT,

04:02.035 --> 04:03.995

BUT SOMETIMES
FOR HIS MINISTERS,

WELL, SHE DIDN'T
LEAVE A NOTE OR ANYTHING?

39:07.013 --> 39:07.972
NO.

39:08.139 --> 39:10.891
SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED.
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.

39:11.058 --> 39:13.728
THAT'S NOT LIKE CAROLINE, GOING
OFF, NOT LEAVING SOME KIND OF WORD.

39:13.894 --> 39:15.396
WELL, CHARLES, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY NEED TO WORRY.

39:15.563 --> 39:17.148
IT'S...MAYBE
SOMETHING CAME UP.

39:17.314 --> 39:20.776
MAYBE CAROLINE WENT TO LEND A HAND
TO A NEIGHBOR. YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.

39:20.943 --> 39:22.653
YEAH. I'D FEEL BETTER
IF I KNEW FOR SURE.

39:22.820 --> 39:23.988
GIRLS, I THINK WE'LL HITCH
UP THE TEAM, HEAD BACK HOME.

39:24.155 --> 39:25.281
WELL, NOW, CHARLES,
THERE'S NO REASON

39:25.448 --> 39:27.241
TO SPOIL THE
CHILDREN'S GOOD TIME.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.826
TAKE THE BUCKBOARD.
IT'LL BE FASTER.

39:28.993 --> 39:30.161
THEN MRS. FOSTER AND I WILL
BRING THE CHILDREN ALONG.

39:30.327 --> 39:31.203
YOU'RE SURE
YOU DON'T MIND?

39:31.370 --> 39:32.663
- NO. GO ON.
- NOT AT ALL

39:32.830 --> 39:34.874
I'D FEEL A LOT BETTER.
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME, GIRLS.

39:35.041 --> 39:36.876
- HAVE A SAFE TRIP.
- BYE, PA.

39:38.836 --> 39:39.920
COME ON!

41:09.135 --> 41:11.262
HEY, INGALLS!

41:11.428 --> 41:13.681
INGALLS,
WAIT A MINUTE!

41:13.848 --> 41:16.058
HO! MR. BARRETT.

41:16.225 --> 41:19.812
MR. INGALLS, I FIGURED IT WAS
ABOUT TIME YOU WAS SHOWING UP.

41:19.979 --> 41:21.814
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BARRETT.

41:21.981 --> 41:24.275
WHY, THAT DAGGONE COW
OF YOURS.

41:24.441 --> 41:25.985
SHOWED UP HERE
CATERWAULING THIS MORNING

41:26.152 --> 41:27.611
BEFORE THE BIRDS
WAS UP.

41:27.778 --> 41:30.239
DUG UP ALL MY WIFE'S
FLOWER GARDEN.

41:30.406 --> 41:31.907
CAROLINE DIDN'T COME BY
TO PICK HER UP?

41:32.074 --> 41:33.576
NO, CAROLINE DIDN'T
COME BY TO PICK HER UP

41:33.742 --> 41:36.871
BECAUSE THEN I WOULDN'T STILL
HAVE THE COW HERE, WOULD I?

41:37.037 --> 41:38.789
NO, SIR.
I FED YOUR ANIMAL--

41:38.956 --> 41:40.416
HA!

41:40.583 --> 41:41.876
AND I..

41:42.042 --> 41:44.628
HEY! DON'T YOU WANT
TO TAKE YOUR ANIMAL?

41:50.759 --> 41:51.844
HYAH!

42:24.335 --> 42:25.461
CAROLINE.

42:52.613 --> 42:57.243
I'VE NEVER SEEN MA
SO SICK BEFORE.

42:57.409 --> 42:59.912
NEITHER HAVE I,
DARLING, BUT...

43:00.079 --> 43:01.163
YOUR MA'S REAL STRONG,

43:01.330 --> 43:04.250
AND DR. BAKER'S DOING
EVERYTHING HE CAN.

43:04.416 --> 43:07.670
SHE'S NOT GOING
TO DIE, IS SHE, PA?

43:07.836 --> 43:10.089
COME ON. THIS IS NO TIME
TO TALK LIKE THAT.

43:12.716 --> 43:14.385
GOD TAKES CARE OF
THOSE THAT LOVE HIM.

43:17.054 --> 43:20.266
THEN HE HAS TO
LET MA LIVE.

43:20.432 --> 43:21.767
HE JUST HAS TO.

43:28.023 --> 43:29.316
HE WILL.
YOU WAIT AND SEE.

43:38.659 --> 43:41.996
WE JUST HAVE TO PRAY...

43:42.162 --> 43:43.497
WITH ALL OUR HEARTS.

43:55.759 --> 43:57.094
Charles:
WITH ALL OUR HEARTS.

46:07.099 --> 46:08.267
DOCTOR.

46:17.151 --> 46:18.569
THE FEVER'S BROKEN.

46:20.612 --> 46:22.072
COURAGEOUS WOMAN.

46:22.239 --> 46:23.949
IF SHE HADN'T OPENED THE
INFECTION WHEN SHE DID,

46:24.116 --> 46:27.578
SHE WOULD HAVE LOST HER
LEG, PROBABLY HER LIFE,

46:27.744 --> 46:31.498
BUT NOW WITH...
WITH REST...

46:31.665 --> 46:33.375
SHE'S GONNA BE JUST FINE.

46:52.186 --> 46:53.562
TELL THE GIRLS,
WILL YOU?

47:00.944 --> 47:02.779
Baker:
YOU CAN Go IN NOW, GIRLS.

47:02.946 --> 47:04.740
Mary: COME ON, CARRIE.
LET'S Go SEE MA.

47:11.580 --> 47:12.831
SHE'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

47:14.958 --> 47:17.169
YOU KNOW, REVEREND,

47:17.336 --> 47:18.921
A DOCTOR WOULD
HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY

47:19.087 --> 47:22.007
MAKING THE DECISION
CAROLINE DID.

47:22.174 --> 47:27.304
HOW SHE PICKED EXACTLY
THE RIGHT MOMENT...

47:27.471 --> 47:29.306
ONLY GOD KNOWS.

47:29.473 --> 47:32.351
I'M SURE HE DOES,
DOCTOR.

47:32.518 --> 47:33.852
I'M SURE HE DOES.
