00:08.842 --> 00:10.051
Get him out. Go! Go!

00:10.135 --> 00:12.637
God! Hold on, sweetie!

00:16.683 --> 00:19.310
I'm right here. Just hold on.

00:30.739 --> 00:34.659
- Vitals?
- Heart rate 220. Temperature's 106.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.494
Will, where does it hurt?

00:36.578 --> 00:39.080
All over.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.875
She says he feels like he's burning.
Check for burns.

00:43.626 --> 00:44.961
I don't see anything.

00:46.087 --> 00:50.425
- Where does it hurt the most, Will?
- Everywhere! Everywhere!

00:56.389 --> 00:59.309
♪ Here we stand or here we fall ♪

01:00.101 --> 01:02.979
♪ History won't care at all ♪

01:03.688 --> 01:05.147
Wait a sec. How big?

01:05.732 --> 01:08.902
First it was like that.
Now he's like this.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.571
I swear to God, man,
it's just some little lizard, okay?

01:11.654 --> 01:13.448
- It's not a lizard.
- How do you know?

01:13.531 --> 01:16.218
- How do I know if it's not?
- How do you know it's not just a lizard?

01:16.242 --> 01:18.369
Because his face opened up
and he ate my cat.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.919
♪ We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall ♪

01:30.298 --> 01:35.178
♪ While you're waiting
For the hammer to fall ♪

01:46.064 --> 01:47.148
I don't hear shit.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.149
He's in there.

02:03.706 --> 02:06.918
All right, listen, kid. I swear, if this
is some sort of Halloween prank,

02:07.001 --> 02:08.127
- you're dead.
- It's not.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.503
- All right?
- It's not a prank.

02:09.586 --> 02:10.922
Get it out of my face.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.841
You got a key for this thing?

02:21.933 --> 02:23.393
Let me see that.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.396
He must be further down there.

02:27.689 --> 02:31.484
I'll stay up here
in case he tries to escape.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.109
Steve?

03:15.987 --> 03:17.405
Steve, what's going on down there?

03:19.782 --> 03:20.867
Get down here.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.748
Oh, shit.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.878
Oh, shit!

03:38.927 --> 03:39.969
No way.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.013
No way.

05:35.501 --> 05:39.213
That thing, it...
it did something to him.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.716
Okay. And these now-memories,
as you call them,

05:41.799 --> 05:43.468
how long has he been experiencing them?

05:43.551 --> 05:45.928
I told you, since Thursday.
Since I found him in the field.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.513
And why wasn't he brought in?

05:47.597 --> 05:50.224
I have been bringing him in,
and what have you done?

05:50.308 --> 05:52.018
Nothing. Nothing!

05:52.101 --> 05:54.062
These are new symptoms, Joyce.

05:54.145 --> 05:58.441
No. No, he has been telling you
over and over that something's wrong,

05:58.524 --> 05:59.964
and you said it was all in his head.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.820
You said, "Be patient."
Those were your words.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.656
I understand that you're upset,
okay? I get it.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.380
I would be, too, if I were in your shoes.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.828
But we are all in the same boat here,
and I just need you to try...

06:10.912 --> 06:13.498
What? Stay calm? Trust you?

06:14.791 --> 06:18.127
No, I want him transferred
to a real hospital.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.629
Well, you know that's not possible.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.232
He really will get
the best treatment here, Mrs. Byers.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.299
The very best.

06:26.552 --> 06:30.431
And what are you
treating him for, exactly?

06:32.934 --> 06:35.937
Can anyone tell me what's wrong with him?

06:36.646 --> 06:41.442
Can a single person in this room
tell me what is wrong with my boy?

06:44.987 --> 06:47.073
What is wrong with my boy?

06:47.156 --> 06:50.451
You see why I have
to stop the truth from spreading, too.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.954
Just the same as those weeds there.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.872
By whatever means necessary.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.646
Whoo-hoo!

07:19.439 --> 07:22.483
- To taking down the man.
- To taking down the man.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.700
Commie bastards sure know how
to make a spirit. Am I right?

07:32.076 --> 07:35.538
- Oh, no, no, no. We... we can't.
- Yeah, no. No, I've got to drive.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.874
Drive? What, tonight?

07:37.957 --> 07:38.875
Our parents...

07:38.958 --> 07:42.086
Would be proud
if they knew what you were up to.

07:42.795 --> 07:46.007
Just tell 'em you're at Tammy's
or Dawn's or whoever's,

07:46.090 --> 07:48.134
and take my guest room.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.848
- I mean, do... do you want to stay?
- Well, it is pretty late.

07:54.515 --> 07:58.186
Okay. Uh...
Could I use the sofa?

07:59.395 --> 08:03.524
Okay, I'm confused.
What's going on here? A lovers' quarrel?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.527
- No, no. I mean, we're just friends.
- Friends.

08:13.534 --> 08:18.581
You've told me a lot of shockers today,
but that, that is the first lie.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.042
- It's not a lie.
- No?

08:21.125 --> 08:23.669
You're young, attractive.

08:23.753 --> 08:29.842
You've got chemistry, history,
plus the real shit, shared trauma.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.929
Trust issues, am I right?

08:33.971 --> 08:35.347
Something to do with your dad.

08:35.431 --> 08:38.601
- What? No, I mean, my dad's...
- An asshole.

08:38.683 --> 08:42.438
Hmm. It is a curse to see so clearly.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.983
You, you're harder to read.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.194
Probably, like everyone,

08:48.277 --> 08:53.032
afraid of what would happen if you
accepted yourself for who you really are

08:53.115 --> 08:58.079
and retreated back to the safety of...

08:58.162 --> 09:00.665
- Name? Name?
- Steve.

09:00.748 --> 09:04.460
Oh. Steve. We like Steve.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.087
Yes.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.923
- But we don't love Steve.
- What?

09:09.632 --> 09:14.011
No, we... I mean, I do.

09:14.595 --> 09:20.893
There it is, ladies and germs,
the second lie of the evening.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.688
So, how'd I do?

09:25.231 --> 09:29.944
My goodness.
You two are adorable, aren't you?

09:33.197 --> 09:34.657
Listen...

09:34.740 --> 09:37.493
...there's a pull-out sofa in my study
if you want it.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.453
But if I were you,

09:40.538 --> 09:43.666
I'd cut the bullshit
and share the damn bed.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.302
Afraid.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.352
Trust issues?

10:04.186 --> 10:05.896
Trust issues.

10:07.898 --> 10:08.899
Retreat?

10:09.859 --> 10:11.569
I don't retreat.

10:11.652 --> 10:15.031
Trust issues? I do not...

10:22.496 --> 10:24.415
Oh. Hey.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.999
Hey.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.461
I just, uh...

10:28.544 --> 10:30.755
I... I just wanted to say that...

10:30.838 --> 10:34.091
Oh, no, don't... I mean... He's so drunk.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.635
- Wasted.
- Yeah.

10:35.718 --> 10:39.013
I mean, what? He knows us for a couple
of hours, and he's got us all figured out?

10:39.096 --> 10:40.097
Exactly.

10:40.181 --> 10:44.101
God. Okay, yeah. I feel...
I'm glad we feel the same way.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.811
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.110
Uh...

10:53.194 --> 10:56.697
So, uh, good night, I guess.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.034
Yeah, um, good night.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.804
Oh, He-Man, thank you for saving my life.
What strong muscles you have.

12:04.348 --> 12:07.893
- I knew it.
- Hey! They're in love!

12:07.977 --> 12:11.355
No, actually, they're not.
They don't even exist on the same planet.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.066
Aren't you too old
to be playing with toys?

12:14.733 --> 12:18.863
That... that's not the point.
The point is to stay out of my room.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.699
Then tell your little nerdy friend
to shut his mouth.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.077
What are you talking about?

12:25.161 --> 12:28.831
"Code red, Lucas. Code red. Code red."

12:28.914 --> 12:30.499
Bunch of nerds.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.713
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.632
Dustin!

12:40.426 --> 12:42.887
This is Lucas. Do you copy? Dustin?

12:42.970 --> 12:45.431
- Well, well, well, look who it is.
- Sorry, man.

12:45.514 --> 12:46.974
My stupid sister turned it off.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.727
Well, when you were having
sister problems, Dart grew again,

12:49.810 --> 12:52.396
he escaped, and I'm pretty sure
he's a baby Demogorgon.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.690
- Wait. What?
- I'll explain later.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.026
- Meet me and Steve at the old junkyard.
- Steve?

12:57.109 --> 12:58.944
And bring your binoculars
and wrist rocket.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.237
Steve Harrington?

13:00.321 --> 13:02.573
All right, let's go.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.534
Just be there, stat. Over and out.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.793
All right, cowboy, good news.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.962
We're giving you the green light.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.631
How you feeling?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.092
Never better.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.637
All right, well, got a present for ya.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.767
- The hell is that?
- Uh, something you should see.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.530
Watch your step.

14:13.644 --> 14:19.692
All living organisms develop
defense mechanisms against attack.

14:19.775 --> 14:23.487
They adapt. They find some way to survive.

14:35.791 --> 14:36.876
Oh, my God.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.879
It's pretty impressive, isn't it?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.881
It's been spreading,

14:42.673 --> 14:45.509
growing beneath us like some cancer.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.305
- Why aren't you burning it?
- There's a complication.

14:55.519 --> 14:58.105
They made me sign,
like, a thousand documents.

14:58.188 --> 15:02.860
I mean...
we all had to. We had to.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.738
I mean, I lost track at a certain point.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.324
They're gonna make you
do the same. I'm sure.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.784
Yeah. Well, hey, whatever.

15:13.662 --> 15:14.747
What kind of documents?

15:14.830 --> 15:17.666
Uh, confidentiality,

15:17.750 --> 15:21.211
and there were these official forms
saying, like, nothing ever happened,

15:21.295 --> 15:22.296
which is why...

15:23.297 --> 15:25.215
Will got lost in the woods.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.299
Yeah.

15:28.177 --> 15:33.140
Man, I always thought stuff like this
happened in movies and comic books.

15:33.223 --> 15:37.019
Certainly not in Hawkins,
and certainly not to someone like you.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.313
- Or you.
- Yeah.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.275
Bob Newby, superhero.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.114
You cold?

15:49.823 --> 15:51.450
Uh, just a little jitters, I guess.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.911
Hey, don't you start worrying about me.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.746
- Okay.
- Okay? I'm fine.

15:55.829 --> 15:56.956
I'm fine.

15:58.415 --> 16:02.836
It's not like you didn't warn me.
"This is not a normal family."

16:02.920 --> 16:05.047
- Isn't that what you said?
- Yeah.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.217
You weren't kidding.

16:08.842 --> 16:12.805
It kinda makes my idea of moving to Maine
sound a little less crazy, right?

16:12.888 --> 16:15.599
Oh, it... it's not crazy at all.

16:18.686 --> 16:19.687
Mom?

16:20.270 --> 16:22.398
Hey.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.567
Is there a doctor? We need a doctor!

16:25.651 --> 16:29.571
- Sweetie, how you feeling? You okay?
- Okay, they're on their way.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.655
Hey.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.994
- Who is that?
- What?

16:35.077 --> 16:38.038
- What?
- It's me, big guy. It's Bob.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.333
Are you a...

16:43.377 --> 16:44.545
doctor?

16:44.628 --> 16:48.966
No. No, it's just me. Just... just Bob.

17:25.419 --> 17:29.423
So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out?

17:30.966 --> 17:32.092
Uh, sorry?

17:33.552 --> 17:34.762
The sofa.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.682
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was good.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.350
I bet.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.230
Oops.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.233
Mmm.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.737
Oh, yeah.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.782
Yeah, we just, um...

17:56.366 --> 17:57.743
We just had some fun girl time.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.721
- Will you be back for dinner?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.973
- Yeah, I'll be home real soon.
- Say hey to Ally for me.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.500
Okay. All right.
I love you, too, Mom. Bye.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.630
She said Mike's at your brother's house.
They just had a sleepover. So...

18:09.713 --> 18:11.298
Oh, okay.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.133
Do you wanna try again?

18:13.217 --> 18:17.179
No. No, it's fine. They're probably
just at the matinée or something.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.640
Yeah, I'm sure.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.566
For your travels.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.112
And to water it down.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.363
Got it.

18:36.156 --> 18:39.034
Thank you for everything.

18:39.118 --> 18:43.247
Don't thank me yet.
Just keep your eyes on the papers, hmm?

18:43.330 --> 18:45.541
And if you need to reach me again...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.168
don't.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.065
Twenty-one.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.112
Twenty-two.

19:17.364 --> 19:20.242
- Max, are you getting that or what?
- Okay!

19:20.325 --> 19:22.161
Swear to God, Max!

19:33.088 --> 19:34.381
What are you doing here?

19:34.464 --> 19:35.716
- I have proof.
- What?

19:35.799 --> 19:38.594
Proof that what I told you was real.
But we have to hurry.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.470
What kind of proof?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.916
Who the hell were you talking to?

20:13.295 --> 20:14.588
Mormons.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.255
Mormons?

20:17.174 --> 20:18.175
Talkative ones.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.236
Come on, hop on.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.031
Hurry.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.743
This better be good, stalker.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.422
Do you know your name?

20:57.506 --> 20:58.757
Will.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.635
- Your full name?
- William Byers.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.929
Do you know... Do you know who I am?

21:05.806 --> 21:07.140
A doctor.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.185
Have we met before?

21:11.311 --> 21:13.272
- I don't remember.
- Hmm.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.149
You don't remember me?

21:17.901 --> 21:19.152
Okay.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.029
How about, uh... How about this guy here?

21:24.741 --> 21:26.118
Know who that is?

21:29.746 --> 21:32.207
It's all right. Take your time.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.044
That's my friend.

21:37.546 --> 21:38.547
Mike.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.676
What about me, kid? You remember me?

21:48.807 --> 21:52.436
They tell me you helped save me
last night. You remember that?

21:54.271 --> 21:57.816
Do you remember anything about last night?
About what happened?

21:58.483 --> 22:01.445
I remember they hurt me.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.741
You mean the doctors?

22:07.242 --> 22:09.995
No. The soldiers.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.289
The soldiers hurt you?

22:13.540 --> 22:15.042
They shouldn't have done that.

22:16.501 --> 22:17.502
It upset him.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.718
You say, "Upset him." Is that him?

22:32.267 --> 22:34.770
Okay. Okay, I wanna try something.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.980
It's gonna seem a little odd at first,

22:37.064 --> 22:39.858
but I think it's really gonna help us
understand what's going on.

22:39.941 --> 22:40.984
Is that okay?

22:42.069 --> 22:43.236
Okay.

22:48.575 --> 22:53.080
Now, Will, I want you to just let us know
if you feel anything. Okay?

23:07.594 --> 23:10.472
- Do you feel anything?
- Little sting.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.100
It stings? Where?

23:13.183 --> 23:14.351
My chest.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.562
- Okay, son.
- Sweetie...

23:19.981 --> 23:22.109
- How about now?
- It... it burns.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.610
Ah!

23:23.693 --> 23:25.070
- It burns.
- Where?

23:26.113 --> 23:27.447
Everywhere.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.075
That's enough. That's enough!

23:30.158 --> 23:33.078
Stop! You heard her! That's enough!

23:33.161 --> 23:34.496
That's it! We're done!

23:34.579 --> 23:36.331
Okay.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.126
Sweetie... Sweetie. It's okay.

23:41.294 --> 23:45.841
Our best guess right now
is it's some kind of virus

23:45.924 --> 23:50.220
which is causing
this neurological disorder.

23:50.303 --> 23:54.432
Now, when... when a typical virus
attaches itself to its host...

23:55.934 --> 24:01.481
...it duplicates, right? It spreads,
essentially hijacking the host.

24:01.565 --> 24:04.067
A virus is alive. It has an intelligence.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.195
That's not... That's not unusual.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.615
What is so unusual here,

24:10.699 --> 24:16.371
this virus... the infected hosts
seem to be communicating.

24:18.081 --> 24:24.963
It has some sort of a hive intelligence,
and it's connecting all the hosts.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.633
The good news is a virus can be cured.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.469
We... we're gonna continue to run tests.

24:32.053 --> 24:33.638
We're gonna see what we find.

24:34.306 --> 24:39.060
What happens
when he can't remember anything?

24:39.144 --> 24:41.438
When there's
nothing else there?

24:42.314 --> 24:45.150
What happens when my boy is gone?

24:54.492 --> 24:56.828
All right,
so let me get this straight.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.247
You kept something
you knew was probably dangerous

24:59.331 --> 25:04.252
in order to impress a girl who...
who you just met?

25:04.878 --> 25:07.756
All right,
that's grossly oversimplifying things.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.425
I mean, why would a girl
like some nasty slug anyway?

25:10.508 --> 25:13.053
An interdimensional slug?
Because it's awesome.

25:13.136 --> 25:15.936
Well, even if she thought it was cool,
which she didn't, I... I just...

25:17.224 --> 25:19.344
I don't know. I just feel like
you're trying too hard.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.966
Well, not everyone can have
your perfect hair, all right?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.688
It's not about the hair, man.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.816
The key with girls is just...
just acting like you don't care.

25:27.525 --> 25:30.528
- Even if you do?
- Yeah, exactly. It drives them nuts.

25:30.612 --> 25:33.198
- Then what?
- You just wait until, uh...

25:36.117 --> 25:38.328
- until you feel it.
- Feel what?

25:38.745 --> 25:40.914
It's like before it's gonna storm,
you know?

25:40.997 --> 25:43.708
You can't see it,
but you can feel it, like this, uh...

25:45.669 --> 25:47.587
electricity, you know?

25:47.671 --> 25:50.632
Oh, like in the electromagnetic field
when the clouds in the atmosphere...

25:50.715 --> 25:54.219
No, no, no, no, no.
Like a... Like a sexual electricity.

25:54.302 --> 25:55.302
Oh.

25:55.887 --> 25:59.766
You feel that and then you make your move.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.309
So that's when you kiss her?

26:01.393 --> 26:04.062
- No, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Romeo.
- Sorry.

26:04.145 --> 26:08.233
Sure, okay, some girls, yeah,
they want you to be aggressive.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.027
You know, strong, hot and heavy, like a...

26:12.237 --> 26:13.738
- I don't know, like a lion.
- Mmm.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.575
But others, you gotta be slow,
you gotta be stealthy, like a...

26:18.243 --> 26:19.244
like a ninja.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.787
What type is Nancy?

26:21.830 --> 26:24.833
Nancy's different.
She's different than the other girls.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.502
Yeah, she seems pretty special, I guess.

26:27.585 --> 26:29.212
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

26:29.296 --> 26:34.050
But this girl's special, too, you know.
It's just, like, something about her.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.428
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

26:36.511 --> 26:38.513
You're not falling in love with this girl,
are you?

26:39.306 --> 26:40.974
Uh, no. No.

26:41.558 --> 26:44.894
- Okay, good. Don't.
- I won't.

26:45.478 --> 26:48.398
She's only gonna break your heart,
and you're way too young for that shit.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.449
Fabergé.

26:57.532 --> 26:58.533
What?

27:00.827 --> 27:02.454
It's Fabergé Organics.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.582
Use the shampoo and conditioner,
and when your hair's damp...

27:05.665 --> 27:06.791
It's not wet, okay?

27:06.875 --> 27:08.460
- When it's damp...
- Damp.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.796
You do four puffs
of the Farrah Fawcett spray.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.800
- Farrah Fawcett spray?
- Yeah, Farrah Fawcett.

27:15.884 --> 27:19.971
You tell anyone I just told you that
and your ass is grass.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.015
You're dead, Henderson. Do you understand?

27:22.098 --> 27:23.098
Yup.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.311
Okay.

27:28.355 --> 27:31.816
- Farrah Fawcett, really?
- I mean, she's hot.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.526
Yeah.

27:51.419 --> 27:52.796
Hey, it's, uh...

27:55.340 --> 27:56.341
It's me.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.554
I know that I've been
gone too long, and, uh...

28:02.889 --> 28:05.767
It's... I just, I want you to know
that it's not about you

28:05.850 --> 28:07.727
and it's not about our fight.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.021
Okay?

28:12.065 --> 28:16.236
Something came up, and I will...
I will explain it all when I see you.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.780
I just... I want you to know
that I'm not mad.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.283
I'm just sorry.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.414
About everything.

28:31.709 --> 28:32.794
I...

28:34.087 --> 28:36.756
I don't want you to get hurt at all.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.344
And I don't wanna lose you.

28:48.226 --> 28:52.147
Just make sure you heat up
some real food. Not just Eggos.

28:52.230 --> 28:56.192
And I want you to eat all the peas,
even if they're mushy and gross. And...

28:58.778 --> 29:00.822
I will be home soon.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.565
This is him last week.

29:07.704 --> 29:11.541
And there are the hippocampal
abnormalities we had discussed.

29:11.624 --> 29:13.334
Nothing out of line with what we've seen

29:13.418 --> 29:16.463
from others suffering
from post-traumatic stress. But...

29:18.339 --> 29:19.924
this is Will from last night.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.134
And as you can see,

29:21.217 --> 29:24.929
there are now abnormalities
in the limbic and paralimbic areas.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.013
And this...

29:28.558 --> 29:29.976
is from an hour ago.

29:37.400 --> 29:41.154
- I don't hear any suggestions.
- We have bigger problems than the boy.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.573
- Do we?
- We can't keep delaying the burn.

29:45.325 --> 29:48.119
You're talking about putting...
putting a Band-Aid on this.

29:48.203 --> 29:51.331
- Right now, a Band-Aid is the best option.
- It's our only option.

29:54.167 --> 29:58.129
- And if it kills the boy?
- Then quite frankly, Sam, it kills him.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.465
Say that to me again.

30:01.382 --> 30:05.011
The rate this is spreading,
he'll be lost by the end of the day.

30:05.094 --> 30:08.223
What we do or don't do
won't change the outcome.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.891
We have to start the burn.

30:13.102 --> 30:14.437
Where you going?

30:15.063 --> 30:16.189
I'm going to think.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.615
What the hell is taking so long?

30:27.325 --> 30:33.581
Hey... doctors take forever, always.
Just try and relax. Just be patient.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.554
You know, I just...

30:52.934 --> 30:54.727
Let me through. Let me through!

30:54.811 --> 30:56.747
- You know we can't do that.
- I need to talk to...

30:56.771 --> 30:59.732
- He'll be with you shortly.
- You said that an hour ago.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.248
Will.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.709
Will? Will?

31:19.752 --> 31:21.880
What's wrong? Are you hurting again?

31:23.965 --> 31:25.258
Uh...

31:25.341 --> 31:26.634
I saw something.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.096
In your now-memories?

31:33.975 --> 31:35.310
The shadow monster.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.355
I think I know how to stop him.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.832
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this will do.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.876
This will do just fine.

32:00.543 --> 32:01.586
Good call, dude.

32:10.511 --> 32:12.805
I said medium-well!

32:15.558 --> 32:17.018
Who's that?

32:24.567 --> 32:25.860
You told her?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.695
- So what?
- "So what?"

32:27.779 --> 32:29.965
- You wanted to tell her, too.
- But I didn't, all right?

32:29.989 --> 32:32.742
We agreed not to tell her
and to look for Dart.

32:32.825 --> 32:35.912
- Who you conveniently found.
- Are you suggesting that I'm lying?

32:35.995 --> 32:38.539
I'm saying you have
a creepy little bond with him.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.917
Yeah, that was before
he turned into a Demogorgon.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.877
- And you haven't heard from Mike?
- No.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.170
- Or Will?
- No.

32:44.253 --> 32:46.881
- Hopper?
- No! No one is around.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.175
Why do you think
I'm with Steve Harrington?

32:50.093 --> 32:52.011
- Something's...
- Wrong. I agree.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.722
Which is why we need
as much help as we can get.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.479
She didn't believe me anyway.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.315
You probably didn't tell it right.

33:04.399 --> 33:05.525
That must be it.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.611
So, we good?

33:10.989 --> 33:14.993
Hey! Dickheads! How come the only one
helping me out is this random girl?

33:15.076 --> 33:17.996
We lose light in 40 minutes. Let's go.
Let's go, I said!

33:18.079 --> 33:20.498
- All right, asshole! God!
- Okay! Stupid.

33:38.975 --> 33:39.976
What...

33:41.352 --> 33:43.604
What is all of this?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.900
I don't know.

33:48.985 --> 33:49.986
Mom?

33:51.362 --> 33:52.363
Will?

34:19.556 --> 34:21.141
I don't shoot Polaroid.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.770
- What?
- It's not mine.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.313
Someone else has been here.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.458
Sam, this is ludicrous.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.793
- Just give him a moment, okay?
- We don't have time...

34:47.877 --> 34:51.172
Hey, jackass, why don't you
do us all a favor and shut up, okay?

35:02.600 --> 35:03.684
That's it.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.813
That's what? What... what's there, Will?

35:08.064 --> 35:09.065
I don't know.

35:09.690 --> 35:14.070
I just know
he doesn't want me to see there.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.240
I think it's important.

36:26.100 --> 36:29.145
Let's see if this kid's a wizard
or schizo, Doc.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.608
First door on your right, gentlemen.

36:35.401 --> 36:38.654
- I'm guessing a ten.
- Let's not overdo it now.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.782
I read four.

36:42.742 --> 36:43.868
Moving in.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.102
So you really fought
one of these things before?

37:53.521 --> 37:56.482
And you're, like, totally,
100% sure it wasn't a bear?

37:56.565 --> 37:59.652
Shit. Don't be an idiot. Okay?
It wasn't a bear.

37:59.735 --> 38:01.946
Why are you even here
if you don't believe us?

38:03.155 --> 38:04.240
Just go home.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.327
Geesh. Someone's cranky.
Past your bedtime?

38:14.417 --> 38:17.211
That's good. Just show her you don't care.

38:18.254 --> 38:19.254
I don't.

38:20.673 --> 38:23.509
Why are you winking, Steve? Stop.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.105
- It's kinda awesome.
- Huh?

38:36.188 --> 38:37.732
The fog, I mean.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.818
Looks like the ocean.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.237
- You miss it?
- What?

38:43.946 --> 38:46.741
The ocean. The waves? California?

38:49.744 --> 38:53.789
- Hawkins seems pretty lame, I bet.
- No, no, no, it's not that. It's just...

38:57.960 --> 39:01.088
My dad's still there. So...

39:01.172 --> 39:05.176
- Why?
- It's this legal term called "divorce."

39:05.259 --> 39:07.762
See, when two married people
don't love each other anymore...

39:07.845 --> 39:08.845
Yeah.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.267
My mom and my stepdad,

39:13.351 --> 39:18.898
they wanted a fresh start away from him.

39:20.274 --> 39:24.695
As if... As if he was the problem,
which is total bull.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.405
And things...

39:27.531 --> 39:29.241
are just worse now.

39:30.117 --> 39:31.869
My stepbrother's always been a dick,

39:31.952 --> 39:37.583
but now he's just angry...
all the time and...

39:40.544 --> 39:43.339
Well, he can't take it out
on my mom, so...

39:44.256 --> 39:46.050
So he takes it out on you?

39:48.886 --> 39:51.180
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

39:51.764 --> 39:58.437
It's just... I know that I can be
a jerk like him sometimes,

39:59.188 --> 40:03.984
and I do not want to be like him. Ever.

40:06.028 --> 40:09.198
I guess I'm angry, too, and...

40:11.784 --> 40:12.827
I'm sorry.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.250
Jesus! What's wrong with me?

40:19.333 --> 40:22.336
Hey. You're nothing
like your brother, okay?

40:23.045 --> 40:26.799
You're cool and different.
And you're super smart.

40:27.716 --> 40:31.053
And you're, like, totally tubular.

40:31.137 --> 40:34.598
- Nobody actually says that, you know.
- Well, I do now.

40:35.182 --> 40:36.767
And it makes you seem really cool.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.854
I like talking with you, Mad Max.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.524
And I like talking with you, stalker.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.368
- You see him?
- No.

40:55.536 --> 40:58.122
Lucas, what's going on?

40:58.205 --> 40:59.248
Hold on!

41:05.379 --> 41:08.382
I've got eyes! Ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock!

41:10.050 --> 41:11.051
There.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.762
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.810
- Wait. You sure that's not a dog?
- What?

41:22.480 --> 41:25.065
He's not taking the bait.
Why is he not taking the bait?

41:25.983 --> 41:27.234
Maybe he's not hungry?

41:28.777 --> 41:30.154
Maybe he's sick of cow.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.582
Steve? Steve, what are you doing?

41:42.208 --> 41:43.208
Steve?

41:46.295 --> 41:47.379
Just get ready.

42:14.490 --> 42:15.783
Come on, buddy.

42:21.914 --> 42:23.999
- What's he doing?
- Expanding the menu.

42:24.708 --> 42:25.876
Come on, buddy.

42:28.379 --> 42:29.505
Come on, buddy.

42:30.297 --> 42:32.758
Come on. Dinner time.

42:33.425 --> 42:36.345
Human tastes better than cat, I promise.

42:38.472 --> 42:39.598
He's insane.

42:40.432 --> 42:41.559
He's awesome.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.832
Steve, watch out!

43:04.915 --> 43:06.083
A little busy here!

43:06.166 --> 43:09.378
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!

43:13.841 --> 43:15.134
Steve!

43:16.552 --> 43:19.555
Steve! Abort! Abort!

43:27.229 --> 43:29.148
- Steve, run!
- Steve, hurry!

43:29.231 --> 43:30.482
Steve, run!

43:33.902 --> 43:34.945
Shit!

43:35.029 --> 43:36.697
Are they rabid or something?

43:37.281 --> 43:39.366
They can't get in! They can't!

43:44.622 --> 43:46.457
Shit!

43:46.540 --> 43:50.794
Is anyone there? Mike? Will? God! Anyone!

43:50.878 --> 43:52.046
Shit!

43:52.963 --> 43:56.258
We're at the old junkyard,
and we are going to die!

44:09.647 --> 44:12.566
Out of the way! Out of the way!
You want some? Come get this!

44:45.516 --> 44:46.892
Jeez.

44:55.776 --> 44:58.195
What happened?

44:58.987 --> 44:59.905
I don't know.

44:59.988 --> 45:01.907
- Steve scared 'em off?
- No.

45:02.491 --> 45:03.491
No way.

45:04.993 --> 45:06.370
They're going somewhere.

45:20.342 --> 45:22.720
- Almost there, ladies.
- Roger.

45:35.649 --> 45:37.359
All right, stay frosty, boys.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.709
- Wait. That's where I was.
- What?

45:53.792 --> 45:55.836
It's that damn graveyard.

46:09.433 --> 46:10.976
Sir, there's nothing here.

46:13.187 --> 46:14.787
Looks like your kid's full of shit, Doc.

46:27.326 --> 46:29.411
Got some kind of fog
moving in now.

46:33.832 --> 46:35.667
I'm sorry.

46:36.752 --> 46:39.213
What? What do you mean, sweetie?

46:41.381 --> 46:42.716
He made me do it.

46:44.510 --> 46:46.887
Who? Who made you do what?

46:47.638 --> 46:48.889
I told you.

46:50.098 --> 46:51.183
They upset him.

46:52.518 --> 46:54.269
They shouldn't have done that.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.272
They shouldn't have upset him.

46:59.233 --> 47:00.233
The spy.

47:01.610 --> 47:02.945
The spy!

47:03.028 --> 47:04.029
We've got movement.

47:05.197 --> 47:06.365
You've got company, fellas.

47:08.325 --> 47:09.159
Whoa, whoa!

47:09.243 --> 47:11.078
I need to get through! It's a trap!

47:11.161 --> 47:13.580
It's a trap! I need to warn them.
It's a trap!

47:16.542 --> 47:19.920
I can't see shit!
Where are they? Where are they?

47:20.963 --> 47:22.214
They're right on you!

47:22.297 --> 47:24.341
- Wait, what?
- What was that?

47:32.224 --> 47:35.435
Will, sweets, talk to me.
You got to help me understand.

47:35.811 --> 47:36.979
It's too late.

48:04.881 --> 48:06.008
You should go now.

48:17.561 --> 48:19.062
They're almost here.
