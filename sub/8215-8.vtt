00:01.300 --> 00:02.665
*

00:50.810 --> 00:53.176
Come on, where are you?

01:53.910 --> 01:55.878
I'm taking you down
this time, Carrie.

01:55.910 --> 01:57.844
A boy can dream, Sean.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.417
Remember, you promised ifI beat
you this time, I get a kiss.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.839
Today, Barry,
you get a kiss anyway.

02:02.890 --> 02:03.914
What about me?

02:03.950 --> 02:05.417
Do I get a kiss, too?

02:05.450 --> 02:07.611
You know, Quinton,
a rain check.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.548
About ten years, okay?

02:09.590 --> 02:11.182
All right, what's
it gonna be, boys?

02:11.230 --> 02:13.425
Bishop to D3.

02:13.460 --> 02:14.688
Uh-huh.
Knight to F6.

02:14.730 --> 02:17.597
Okay.
Even with you incredible memory,

02:17.630 --> 02:20.190
there's a lot of boards
with a lot of moves.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.298
You can't win.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.638
Pawn to GS.

02:23.670 --> 02:25.706
My memory is more
than incredible, Barry.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.731
It's perfect,
which is why I remember

02:27.780 --> 02:31.272
the same Budapest Gambit
October 14 of last year.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.744
Are you ready?

02:33.780 --> 02:34.815
Quinton...

02:34.850 --> 02:36.340
Rook to C1.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.812
Sean”.

02:37.850 --> 02:39.386
Queen to F7.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.853
Barry...

02:40.890 --> 02:42.653
Queen to H5.

02:42.690 --> 02:44.624
Surrender and keep dreaming.

02:44.660 --> 02:46.298
Oh, thank you very much!

02:46.330 --> 02:47.957
Don't look so sad.
Carrie Wells!

02:48.000 --> 02:50.321
Still undefeated!

02:50.370 --> 02:51.428
Hey, Al.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.675
Two Chinese tourists found the
body when it washed up on shore.

03:01.710 --> 03:03.849
They called it in,
but not before posting

03:03.880 --> 03:06.314
a video of the whole thing
on Facebook.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.716
The mayor brought us in
to control spin.

03:08.750 --> 03:09.842
Who is he?

03:09.890 --> 03:12.358
No I.D.
Kid didn't have a wallet on him.

03:12.390 --> 03:13.414
Hey, Jo.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.859
Hey, there.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.688
Okay. Male, early 20$.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.449
Looks like a single gunshot
wound to the back of the head.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.468
Been in the water
maybe eight to ten hours,

03:22.500 --> 03:24.388
according to rigor.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.796
I'm estimating the time of death
to be around midnight,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.434
but I'll know more
when I get back to the lab.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.232
I've seen him before.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.839
On a flyer.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.518
His name is Sam Miller.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.609
He was reported missing
last week.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.516
Looks like we found him.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.371
I just got off
this endless conference call

04:11.410 --> 04:12.479
with the Tourist Board.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.044
Good Lord, those
people can chat.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.389
I assume they want
this wrapped up quickly?

04:16.420 --> 04:18.342
They want this
wrapped up yesterday.

04:18.390 --> 04:19.516
What do we know so far?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.414
Sam Miller was 22,

04:21.460 --> 04:23.758
an environmental studies major
at Denton University,

04:23.790 --> 04:25.951
by all accounts a good kid,
good grades.

04:25.990 --> 04:26.820
No criminal record.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.327
And according
to his school records,

04:28.360 --> 04:29.497
Sam lived with his parents

04:29.530 --> 04:31.293
Bruce and Shelly Miller,

04:31.330 --> 04:33.469
up in Throggs Neck,
in the Bronx.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.297
At least up until a month ago,
when he dropped out of school

04:35.340 --> 04:36.602
and pretty much out of sight.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.301
The kid left home--
no forwarding address,

04:38.340 --> 04:39.773
no way to contact him.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.402
He only took
his cell phone with him.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.805
After his mother didn't hear
from him for three weeks,

04:42.850 --> 04:44.374
_ _ she filed
a mIssmg persons report.

04:44.410 --> 04:45.638
What mother waits three weeks

04:45.680 --> 04:47.318
_ _ to file
a mIssmg persons report?

04:47.350 --> 04:49.341
Hmm.
What do we know

04:49.390 --> 04:51.711
about this family?
Well, Sam's dad owns

04:51.750 --> 04:52.978
three supermarkets

04:53.020 --> 04:55.409
between Castle Hill
and Hunt's Point.

04:55.460 --> 04:56.358
He also has
one hell of a temper.

04:56.390 --> 04:58.381
In the past six months,
patrol's responded

04:58.430 --> 04:59.658
to the apartment four times

04:59.700 --> 05:01.452
after neighbors
heard them all fighting.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.524
No charges were filed.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.458
We need to find out what
was gomg on In that house

05:04.500 --> 05:06.434
and why it took so long
to report him missing.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.638
But the Tourist Board,
they're...

05:11.670 --> 05:12.876
they're just mean.

05:20.650 --> 05:21.742
We're very sorry for your loss.

05:21.780 --> 05:22.986
CARRIE: Mrs. Miller,

05:23.020 --> 05:24.487
you took a while

05:24.520 --> 05:27.353
before you filed a missing
persons report on Sam.

05:27.390 --> 05:29.358
Any reason for that?

05:29.390 --> 05:31.654
He took off about a month ago.

05:31.690 --> 05:34.454
Sam was in college.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.751
He'd go off the grid

05:35.800 --> 05:37.825
from time to time-- a week,

05:37.870 --> 05:40.737
ten days wasn't
out of the ordinary, but...

05:40.770 --> 05:42.658
once it became a few weeks
wrthout a phone call,

05:42.710 --> 05:45.099
that's_when I knew
something was wrong.
Mr. Miller,

05:45.140 --> 05:47.131
we're trying to piece
together what happened

05:47.180 --> 05:48.807
so I have to ask:

05:48.840 --> 05:50.148
On a few occasions,

05:50.180 --> 05:52.478
your neighbors heard
you fighting with Sam

05:52.520 --> 05:53.942
loud enough they had
to call the police?

05:53.980 --> 05:57.108
What does that have to do
with who killed my boy?

05:57.150 --> 05:59.880
Would you mind if I took
a look around Sam's bedroom?

05:59.920 --> 06:01.057
Why?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.524
Well, anything I could learn

06:03.560 --> 06:04.720
about Sam might help.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.359
I'm sorry.

06:18.410 --> 06:22.005
This is all just so hard.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.099
I can't imagine
what you must be going through.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.808
Paroxetine.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.716
Was Sam depressed?

06:35.760 --> 06:37.557
Uh, he had OCD.
Oh.

06:37.590 --> 06:41.196
But it was under control
for a while now.

06:41.230 --> 06:43.698
Detective Wells, I know that

06:43.730 --> 06:46.563
my husband may seem a bit gruff.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.830
He and Sam fought,
but you have to know

06:48.870 --> 06:51.998
that Bruce loved Sam very much.

06:52.040 --> 06:55.430
And he never got violent
with him or anything like that?

06:55.480 --> 06:56.970
No.

06:57.010 --> 06:59.478
Parents know how heated
those fights can get,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.648
but Bruce would never hurt Sam.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.646
We're not making
any accusations.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.783
I can't believe this.
We're just trying to find out

07:06.820 --> 07:08.617
what you argued about.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.549
What every parent argues
about with their kid:

07:11.590 --> 07:13.524
what the hell Sam's
gonna do with his life.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.925
The neighbors...

07:14.960 --> 07:16.097
what they heard...

07:16.130 --> 07:18.598
Bruce has had a
short fuse lately.

07:18.630 --> 07:19.961
What with his employees

07:20.000 --> 07:21.968
wanting to unionize the market.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.937
Where were you around
midnight last night?

07:25.970 --> 07:27.176
Oh, you son of a bitch!

07:27.210 --> 07:29.599
You know,
I was with my wife, at home,

07:29.650 --> 07:31.504
worrying about my son.

07:31.550 --> 07:32.778
How dare you accuse me
of anything!

07:32.820 --> 07:35.516
Look, I argued with Sam

07:35.550 --> 07:36.517
because I loved him.

07:36.550 --> 07:38.848
I would never have hurt him.

07:40.990 --> 07:42.628
It's gotten really scary.

07:42.660 --> 07:46.221
These union people,
they put dead rats at our door.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.852
They broke into your building?

07:47.900 --> 07:48.855
Yeah.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.959
A little over a month ago.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.536
That's right around the time
Sam left,

07:52.570 --> 07:53.798
right?

07:53.840 --> 07:56.229
And you hadn't spoken
to him since?

07:56.270 --> 07:57.168
No.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.678
You don't think
they hurt my son, do you?

07:59.710 --> 08:01.678
I don't know.

08:01.710 --> 08:04.201
But I'm gonna find out.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.714
Hey.
Oh, hi.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.513
Here's what I've got:

08:09.550 --> 08:13.680
I pulled a .38-caliber round
from his frontal lobe.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.553
The point of entry was
at the base of the skull,

08:16.590 --> 08:18.524
passed through
the basal ganglia.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.619
He died instantly.
So Sam was shot

08:20.660 --> 08:22.025
and then tossed in the river.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.220
I'm betting whoever killed Sam

08:23.270 --> 08:25.693
was hoping his body would get
swept out into the ocean.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.595
Makes sense.
Mmm.

08:27.640 --> 08:32.668
This tox screen came back clean,
except for his OCD meds.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.701
His T-cells were up--
he probably had a cold.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.071
He looks
like a sweet kid.

08:36.110 --> 08:38.601
WEBSTER:
It's such a shame.

08:38.650 --> 08:39.912
We're not gonna back down.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.111
I got one message for Miller:

08:42.150 --> 08:44.744
a union united
will never be divided.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.714
Guy's name is Ray Pulaski.
He's been head of the GSWUA

08:47.760 --> 08:49.978
for the past three years.
Guy knows how to
work a picket line.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.657
And he's been effective.

08:51.690 --> 08:54.124
Pulaski's been unionizing
supermarkets borough by borough.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.253
He started off in Queens with
a few grocery stores in Astoria,

08:56.300 --> 08:57.062
and now he's hitting the Bronx.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.897
Does he have a record?
Not so much

08:58.930 --> 09:00.693
a record,
but he likes to stir the pot.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.162
On at least two separate
occasions this year,

09:02.200 --> 09:03.963
NYPD had to respond
to an altercation

09:04.010 --> 09:06.308
at one of his protests.
According to
Sam's mother,

09:06.340 --> 09:08.979
Pulaski's guys left some
dead rats at their front door

09:09.010 --> 09:11.001
a month ago to
send 'em a message.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.677
Maybe Pulaski
went after Sam

09:12.720 --> 09:15.348
to make sure they heard
that message loud and clear.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.689
What are you busting
my balls for?

09:17.720 --> 09:18.982
You guys are cops.

09:19.020 --> 09:21.818
What would your lives be like
without a union protecting you?

09:21.860 --> 09:23.680
Hmm. Can you account
for your whereabouts

09:23.730 --> 09:25.925
for the past 48 hours?
Sure, I can.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.099
I been working three different
picket lines nonstop.

09:28.130 --> 09:30.189
I haven't seen my own family
in two days.

09:30.230 --> 09:31.925
You kept up your picket
even after Miller's only son

09:31.970 --> 09:33.096
was murdered?
Hey, no rest

09:33.140 --> 09:34.266
for the weary, right?

09:34.300 --> 09:35.767
I'm guessing
you got witnesses

09:35.800 --> 09:36.698
to back your story?
Yeah.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.901
Those hardworking Americans
over there,

09:38.940 --> 09:40.771
fighting to make
a decent wage.

09:40.810 --> 09:41.834
People might think
unions are dead,

09:41.880 --> 09:43.108
but they got another thing
coming.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.970
You want to explain
the rodents you deposited

09:45.010 --> 09:46.773
at the Millers' door?

09:46.820 --> 09:47.969
It was a stunt.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.988
Morale can sag on a picket line.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.783
I had to rally the troops.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.118
You might want to start
by buying 'em some pizza.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.787
We subpoenaed
Sam's cell records.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.629
You called Sam
at least eight times

09:57.660 --> 09:58.979
since your protest
started.

09:59.030 --> 10:01.248
Hey, the kid knew
what side to be on.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.619
He knew his dad was wrong.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.695
Sam was helping you?

10:04.730 --> 10:06.960
Who do you think let us in
to drop off the rats?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.764
He was giving us
inside information on his dad.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.732
Look, Sam was
a good kid.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.670
He cared about
the everyday worker

10:13.710 --> 10:14.802
and what we're fighting for.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.705
But maybe his dad found out,

10:16.750 --> 10:18.900
because Sam _
stopped cooperating

10:18.950 --> 10:20.144
a few weeks back

10:20.180 --> 10:22.239
and I never _heard
from hIm smce.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.884
Now listen, doll, unless
you're gonna arrest me,

10:23.920 --> 10:27.356
I got a picket
to get back to.

10:27.390 --> 10:29.255
First thing,
pull the news footage

10:29.290 --> 10:30.757
just to make sure
about his alibi,

10:30.790 --> 10:32.189
but we got to
get Miller back in.

10:32.230 --> 10:34.221
Shelley already
alibied him.

10:34.260 --> 10:35.397
We gotta get
Miller alone

10:35.430 --> 10:36.522
so he can't
intimidate his wife.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.926
Then we'll see how long
that alibi stands up.
Yeah.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.892
Yeah, okay.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.362
Damn it.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.731
So, no luck with that
union guy Pulaski?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.101
Well, aside from the cops

10:47.140 --> 10:49.335
breaking up some scuffles
at his protests,

10:49.380 --> 10:50.870
all he's got
are a couple citations

10:50.910 --> 10:52.241
for obstructing traffic.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.077
Well, maybe I'll get luclq
with the dad.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.417
Hmm.

10:55.450 --> 10:58.180
You know...

10:58.220 --> 11:01.451
I still don't get
how you wait three weeks

11:01.490 --> 11:02.889
to report your kid missing.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.148
Oh, come on, Murray,
Sam's in college.

11:05.190 --> 11:06.726
When I was in school,
I'd go a month

11:06.760 --> 11:08.193
without talking to my parents.

11:08.230 --> 11:11.063
I can't imagine not knowing
where Maia is for that long.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.738
Your daughter's nine years old.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.091
Let's revisit this in ten years.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.836
No, trust me, I will now.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.174
You probably would.

11:22.210 --> 11:24.872
What is that supposed to mean?

11:24.910 --> 11:25.569
Nothing, no-- I don't know.

11:25.610 --> 11:27.714
I'm just saying
that I'm sure

11:27.750 --> 11:29.843
Maia loves the fact

11:29.890 --> 11:32.415
that you bring
her snack to school

11:32.450 --> 11:35.351
every single day...

11:35.390 --> 11:37.221
in a purple lunch box.

11:37.260 --> 11:38.386
Hey.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.296
She likes orange slices
and provolone.

11:42.330 --> 11:44.025
And it has to stay cool.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.128
Of course it does.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.933
All the time.

11:46.970 --> 11:48.039
So, what, I'm a
helicopter mom now?

11:48.070 --> 11:48.991
No, I wouldn't say that.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.759
I think you're more like
a... a bulldozer mom.

11:51.810 --> 11:52.777
Oh, God.

11:52.810 --> 11:55.973
Better still,
steamroller mom.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.872
That's funny.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.275
And I was gonna offer you
an animal cracker.

12:04.050 --> 12:06.041
-Whoop...
-Oh...

12:07.960 --> 12:09.757
When did you find out

12:09.790 --> 12:11.758
Sam was helping Pulaski?

12:11.790 --> 12:12.757
I already told you,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.223
I_ had no idea Sam was
gIVIng them Information.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.922
Sam was undermining
everything you worked for.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.859
You seriously think
I'd kill my own son?

12:20.900 --> 12:22.959
The man who put him
in rehab three times,

12:23.010 --> 12:24.932
even though Sam
was hell-bent

12:24.970 --> 12:27.131
on killing himself
with those drugs?

12:28.980 --> 12:29.947
Sam was a drug addict?

12:31.980 --> 12:34.346
It started when he was 17.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.268
Prescription drugs,
mostly.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.878
We kept it quiet.

12:37.920 --> 12:38.989
His mother and I

12:39.020 --> 12:42.114
have sacrificed...
so much.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.523
But we'd do anything
to help Sam.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.859
He started abusing
oxycodone in order

12:50.900 --> 12:53.266
to self-medicate his OCD.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.836
You have no idea

12:54.870 --> 12:57.009
how horrible
that addiction is.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.860
Each time Sam went
through withdrawal

12:58.910 --> 13:01.538
he-he couldn't think straight,
and it...

13:01.580 --> 13:03.002
it nearly killed his mother.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.540
But Sam's blood work was clean.

13:04.580 --> 13:05.979
There was no oxy in his system.

13:06.010 --> 13:06.977
It may not
have been in

13:07.020 --> 13:08.817
his system when he died.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.841
Sam was using again.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.079
It was that damn protest group

13:15.120 --> 13:16.348
he got involved with in college.

13:16.390 --> 13:18.085
What protest group?

13:18.130 --> 13:21.099
Stand Up To The System.

13:21.130 --> 13:23.428
They're...

13:23.470 --> 13:25.426
"Occupy Wall Street" types.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.892
He changed after
he met them.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.134
Became agitated.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.434
The fights your neighbors heard?

13:30.470 --> 13:32.108
Were they about this group?

13:32.140 --> 13:34.836
They turned my own son
against me.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.543
My family has been
through... so much.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.872
Those deadbeats killed my son,

13:41.920 --> 13:44.445
whether they pulled
the trigger or not.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.122
Millers are sticking
to their story

13:52.160 --> 13:54.025
and Pulaski checks out, as well.

13:54.060 --> 13:55.288
What have you got?

13:55.330 --> 13:57.195
I was just checking out
Sam's protest group,

13:57.230 --> 13:59.221
and according to
the message boards,

13:59.270 --> 14:00.965
some of the members
grew their own weed

14:01.000 --> 14:02.934
out on these remote islands,
just off the Bronx.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.959
They say which ones?
No.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.103
Message boards were
shut down two months ago.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.040
Group was disbanded
after the leader was arrested

14:10.080 --> 14:11.638
for possession
with intent to distribute.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.069
What if Sam kept growing weed

14:14.120 --> 14:16.918
on these islands?

14:16.950 --> 14:18.212
I mean, we know dealers

14:18.250 --> 14:19.979
far more dangerous
than these kids

14:20.020 --> 14:22.580
use these islands as
a way station for their product.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.224
You're thinking
Sam crossed dealers

14:24.260 --> 14:25.579
who were protecting
their own turf.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.419
Show me the islands.
All right.

14:28.460 --> 14:31.122
Well...

14:31.170 --> 14:32.467
Okay, these three islands

14:32.500 --> 14:33.899
are directly in
the current pattern

14:33.940 --> 14:36.033
upriver from where
we found Sam's body,

14:36.070 --> 14:38.129
I don't recognize
any of them.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.934
Wards Island had the first
bridge crossing into Manhattan.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.006
South Brother Island,

14:44.050 --> 14:46.302
the little one there--
that's where Jacob Ruppert,

14:46.350 --> 14:48.375
early owner of the Yankees,
had a summer house.

14:48.420 --> 14:51.082
I guess I'll take
Bizarre Trivia for 500, Alex.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.644
AL:
And North Brother Island

14:52.690 --> 14:55.409
is where Typhoid Mary
was quarantined for 30 years.

14:55.460 --> 14:56.449
Typhoid Mary?

15:01.460 --> 15:05.066
Sam was reading up
on Typhoid Mary.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.965
Tell me more about
North Brother Island.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.692
AL:
It's deserted now.

15:09.740 --> 15:11.708
Nobody's lived there
since the '605.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.605
Now it's a bird
sanctuary for herons.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.278
JAY: Sounds like
the perfect place

15:15.310 --> 15:17.005
to grow weed
without being noticed.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.005
And the perfect place...

15:18.050 --> 15:19.244
To get away with murder.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.372
Yeah.

15:40.770 --> 15:43.238
You drive a boat better
than you drive a car.

15:43.270 --> 15:44.339
Hah!

15:44.370 --> 15:46.099
I'll take that
as a compliment.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.008
CARRIE:
This place is kind of...

15:50.050 --> 15:52.473
spoolq, huh?

15:52.510 --> 15:53.670
I heard it was haunted.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.041
What?
Yeah.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.479
Back in the 18005,
when this place

15:57.520 --> 15:59.988
was filled with
quarantined patients,

16:00.020 --> 16:01.510
they used to ship the bodies

16:01.560 --> 16:03.551
back to Port Morris
from this very spot.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.258
What are you doing?

16:06.290 --> 16:08.053
Well, I'm talking...
What are you doing?

16:08.100 --> 16:09.453
No, I'm making
conversation.
No, you're not.
You're trying...

16:09.500 --> 16:11.229
You're not mak...
you're trying to freak me out.

16:12.770 --> 16:13.737
Oh, you're spooked.
You know what?

16:13.770 --> 16:16.068
You're spooked.
I'm not spooked,
I'm focused.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.067
We've got a case...
Ooh...

16:17.110 --> 16:18.236
Want to talk
about spooked?

16:18.270 --> 16:20.579
Uh, Saranac Lake,
August 23, 2000.

16:20.610 --> 16:21.634
_ A bird flew
into our room...

16:21.680 --> 16:22.908
It was a bat.
"It was a bat."

16:22.940 --> 16:25.044
It was a very
large bat.
"Ooh! There's a bat
in our room!

16:25.080 --> 16:26.308
Can you let anything go?
My God!"

16:26.350 --> 16:27.419
You screamed like
a little girl, didn't you?

16:27.450 --> 16:28.348
Well, guess what?

16:28.380 --> 16:30.644
I bet there's a lot
of bats on this island.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.409
Who's spooked now?

16:35.360 --> 16:37.419
CARRIE:
Scared of bats...

16:37.460 --> 16:40.429
and giant bugs
crawling up in your suit...

16:41.460 --> 16:43.428
Just think--

16:43.470 --> 16:46.564
once, this whole place
was teeming with people.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.160
Yeah,
contaminated people.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.567
For a bad-ass cop,
you seem a little jumpy.

16:52.610 --> 16:55.170
I am so notjumpy.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.098
What was that?

16:58.610 --> 17:01.408
Oh.

17:01.450 --> 17:04.146
Sometimes a bird sanctuary

17:04.190 --> 17:07.216
is just a bird sanctuary.

17:17.100 --> 17:18.727
Wait a minute,

17:18.770 --> 17:21.159
something's different.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.531
JAY:
Sounds like the perfect place

17:22.570 --> 17:24.265
to grow weed
without being noticed.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.308
You know, your birds are pretty
handy with woodwork.

17:45.390 --> 17:48.188
Police. Don't move.
Show me your hands.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.430
I told you, we're not
growing pot out here.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.846
No, but you are trespassing
on government property.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.108
What's your name?

18:05.150 --> 18:06.174
Jordan Davis.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.472
Eyes to the wall, Jordan.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.839
I'm just saying...
And shut your mouth.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.682
No weapons, no drugs.
They're clean.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.210
All right, listen,
what are you doing here?

18:16.260 --> 18:18.888
Minimizing
our ecological footprint.

18:18.930 --> 18:20.397
What?!

18:20.430 --> 18:21.897
Moved out here
about a month ago.

18:21.930 --> 18:24.228
Been living off the land.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.433
See, society has been destroying
this Earth at an insane rate.

18:27.470 --> 18:29.859
People consume
far more than they need.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.436
WOMAN; Please don't turn
us in, we're not

18:31.470 --> 18:32.607
hurting anyone.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.902
We only hid from you
because we thought

18:33.940 --> 18:35.134
you were park rangers.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.274
Hey, Jordan,
I couldn't find the...

18:38.310 --> 18:39.447
What's going on?

18:47.320 --> 18:50.221
You went to Denton College
with Sam Miller, didn't you?

18:50.260 --> 18:51.454
Yes.

18:51.490 --> 18:53.458
Is everything okay?

18:58.300 --> 19:00.768
I can't believe he's dead.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.791
You and Sam were
close, yeah?

19:04.340 --> 19:05.807
Yeah.

19:07.710 --> 19:08.870
Sam and I took

19:08.910 --> 19:12.471
Environmental Health
together and...

19:12.510 --> 19:15.513
since the first day,
it felt like...

19:15.550 --> 19:19.213
like we knew each other,
you know?

19:19.250 --> 19:20.285
That we could
trust each other,

19:20.320 --> 19:23.653
even though
we had just met.

19:23.690 --> 19:25.578
I haven't been able
to trust many people

19:25.630 --> 19:27.257
in my life, so...

19:30.430 --> 19:32.523
Listen, I know
how hard this

19:32.570 --> 19:34.629
must be for you.
And I want you

19:34.670 --> 19:37.264
to know no one here is gonna
get in any trouble, okay?

19:37.310 --> 19:40.234
Mm-hmm.
I gotta ask you:

19:40.280 --> 19:43.807
was Sam or any of you guys
growing weed on this island?

19:43.850 --> 19:47.217
God, n-no. We...

19:47.250 --> 19:48.217
We don't allow drugs here,

19:48.250 --> 19:49.979
no weapons,
no temptations

19:50.020 --> 19:51.942
of any kind. That's...

19:51.990 --> 19:54.811
That's how we look out for
each other and stay clean.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.714
You all had drug problems?

19:56.760 --> 19:58.318
Well, not everyone, but...

19:58.360 --> 20:00.294
none of us
really have a home

20:00.330 --> 20:02.321
to go back to, so...

20:05.030 --> 20:07.897
Look, we weren't
doing anything illegal.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.659
I promise.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.507
I can show you our gardens.

20:12.540 --> 20:14.269
Sure.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.474
We use these tunnels
as a shortcut.

20:18.510 --> 20:19.841
This way.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.849
Watch your step.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.281
Be careful,
there's a big

20:30.330 --> 20:32.548
hole here.
Stay close to the wall.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.831
This is like
an obstacle course, huh?

20:47.410 --> 20:49.037
It's like a maze.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.947
It can get really confusing
in here, but you get used to it.

21:07.430 --> 21:08.897
Wait...

21:08.930 --> 21:09.851
No, it's... it's this one.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.027
Sorry, there's so many doors,
I always forget.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.265
Uh, stay to the right.
Ah. Okay.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.429
Wow.

21:24.410 --> 21:25.741
Wow, this is incredible.

21:29.450 --> 21:32.010
LOUISA: Sam was working
on purifying our water.

21:32.050 --> 21:33.449
He was in charge of our garden.

21:33.490 --> 21:34.684
That's why he took our boat

21:34.720 --> 21:36.517
back to the city--
he was gonna pick up

21:36.560 --> 21:39.324
his last paycheck
and get some seeds.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.395
Wait a second.

21:40.430 --> 21:41.727
Sam left the island?

21:41.760 --> 21:43.762
Yesterday.
Alone?

21:43.800 --> 21:45.427
Yeah.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.893
He said he'd only be gone
for a couple of hours, but...

21:47.940 --> 21:50.659
Louisa, did Sam have a problem
with anyone on the island?

21:50.710 --> 21:52.405
Any issues that you know about?

21:52.440 --> 21:53.532
No.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.536
No, they respected him.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.938
We really just gonna
leave these kids here?

22:06.990 --> 22:09.356
Well, most of them don't have
anywhere else to go, Al.

22:09.390 --> 22:10.823
I mean,
what are we gonna do?

22:10.860 --> 22:12.122
They can't live here.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.594
Listen, we have
more important things to do

22:14.630 --> 22:16.996
than bust a bunch of kids
for trespassing, okay?

22:17.030 --> 22:18.668
Come on.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.134
You left them squatting
on North Brother Island?

22:21.170 --> 22:22.933
Think of it
as camping.

22:22.970 --> 22:24.403
Or what you've
read about camping.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.477
I'll have you know
I hiked the entire Inca Trail

22:27.510 --> 22:29.808
to the top
of Machu Picchu.
That's walking, not camping.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.546
You two are seriously
debating this right now?

22:31.580 --> 22:34.413
Sam's girlfriend, Louisa,
told us Sam went alone

22:34.450 --> 22:37.010
back to Manhattan yesterday
afternoon to get supplies.

22:37.050 --> 22:39.086
We know he never made
it back to the island

22:39.120 --> 22:40.485
and was killed
around midnight.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.714
Those kids couldn't
have killed Sam.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.159
They couldn't even
get off the island,

22:43.190 --> 22:44.657
'cause Sam had
their only boat.

22:44.690 --> 22:46.021
And you and Carrie
believe their story?

22:46.060 --> 22:47.698
Jay's looking for the
boat to confirm it,

22:47.730 --> 22:49.493
but, yes, we do.
All right.

22:49.530 --> 22:50.963
Finding Sam's killer

22:51.000 --> 22:53.491
is our priority,
but, make no mistake,

22:53.540 --> 22:54.837
we will revisit this--

22:54.870 --> 22:58.067
both the camping
and the squatting.

23:02.110 --> 23:03.134
Hey, guys.

23:03.180 --> 23:04.738
NYPD found a Zodiac

23:04.780 --> 23:06.668
tied off the dock
at Barretto Point Park.

23:06.710 --> 23:09.144
Park rangers didn't recognize
the boat, thought it was stolen

23:09.180 --> 23:10.169
so they called it in.
Turns out

23:10.220 --> 23:11.744
the boat's owned
by Jordan Davis,

23:11.790 --> 23:13.189
but he never reported it stolen.

23:13.220 --> 23:14.653
That's one of the kids
on the island.
MURRAY: Mm-hmm.

23:14.690 --> 23:16.510
Were Sam's prints on the boat?

23:16.560 --> 23:18.482
Well, we got a couple
of partials, but check this out.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.829
Ran facial recognition,
got a positive hit on Sam.

23:21.860 --> 23:25.159
This was taken at 4:00 pm.
the day Sam was killed.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.565
He took
that boat alone.

23:26.600 --> 23:27.897
Well, that is definitely Sam,

23:27.940 --> 23:29.999
which means Louisa's story
checks out.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.667
All right,
so we need to retrace his steps

23:31.710 --> 23:34.531
from when he got to Manhattan
to when he was killed.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.070
Louisa told us

23:36.110 --> 23:38.203
he was on his way to pick up
his final paycheck

23:38.250 --> 23:41.139
so he could
buy seeds.
Okay, according

23:41.180 --> 23:43.489
to Sam's work history,
his last known job

23:43.520 --> 23:45.818
was at a clinical research lab
run out of Denton

23:45.850 --> 23:48.011
by a Dr. Paul Hughes.

23:55.730 --> 23:58.164
I'll see if Dr. Hughes
can fit you in,

23:58.200 --> 24:00.498
but he's been in meetings
with Mazurtech executives

24:00.540 --> 24:03.839
all morning.
Oh, I think he'll fit us in.

24:03.870 --> 24:06.031
Mazurtech funds
all of his research.

24:08.580 --> 24:11.003
Excuse me, Dr. Hughes.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.176
Uh, these detectives
are here to see you.

24:12.210 --> 24:14.212
Oh, please, please come in.
We were just wrapping up.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.115
It's good
to see you again, Paul.
Yeah.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.219
Good afternoon.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.582
What can I do for you,
Detectives?

24:19.620 --> 24:21.952
Detective Wells,
I'm Lieutenant Burns.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.787
We're investigating the murder
of Sam Miller.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.252
I understand he worked here.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.952
Yes. I-I heard what happened
on the news.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.797
I-I'm still
in shock.

24:29.830 --> 24:31.229
Sam was a wonderful

24:31.270 --> 24:32.726
young man.

24:32.770 --> 24:34.795
About two days ago,
he came by to pick up

24:34.840 --> 24:36.489
his final paycheck.

24:36.540 --> 24:39.634
HUGHES: That can't be.
I haven't seen Sam since he quit

24:39.670 --> 24:40.705
a month ago.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.571
Uh...

24:42.610 --> 24:44.544
Yep. As you can see,

24:44.580 --> 24:46.275
he was paid in full.

24:46.310 --> 24:47.743
Have you had any contact

24:47.780 --> 24:49.213
with Sam
in the last few weeks?

24:49.250 --> 24:50.239
HUGHES:
No.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.579
I tried calling a few times,
but he never returned.

24:53.620 --> 24:57.681
I spoke with his father once,
but Mr. Miller said

24:57.730 --> 25:00.528
it was a family matter and
I should mind my own business,

25:00.560 --> 25:03.028
so...
What did Sam do in the lab?

25:03.060 --> 25:04.721
Data entry, mostly.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.067
I‘m an infectious
disease speCIalist,

25:06.100 --> 25:08.933
and Sam compiled the results
of my research.

25:08.970 --> 25:10.961
Sam loved science,

25:11.010 --> 25:12.807
figuring out
how the world works,

25:12.840 --> 25:14.808
which is why I knew
that there was something

25:14.840 --> 25:16.671
very wrong
when he left.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.268
How so?
I've been
Sam's adVIsor

25:18.310 --> 25:20.005
since he was a freshman.

25:20.050 --> 25:22.177
I probably shouldn't
say anything, but...

25:22.220 --> 25:25.212
Sam had a problem
with prescription medication.

25:25.250 --> 25:27.081
We know about the stints
in rehab.

25:27.120 --> 25:32.148
I cure diseases, but I had
no cure for Sam's addiction.

25:32.190 --> 25:35.159
He fought so hard
to stay clean

25:35.200 --> 25:36.690
but, uh, not always
successfully, I'm afraid.

25:36.730 --> 25:39.290
I offered to help him,
but Sam wouldn't let me.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.094
Sam wouldn't let
anyone help him.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.233
Okay. Thank you.

25:44.270 --> 25:46.238
If-if there's anything more
that I can do,

25:46.270 --> 25:48.602
please just let me know.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.609
So let's say Sam
fell off the wagon.
Right.

25:51.650 --> 25:54.346
What, do you think that's
the reason he lied to Louisa

25:54.380 --> 25:56.211
about why he came back
to Manhattan?

25:56.250 --> 25:58.684
They all want to stay
clean, Sam couldn't.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.019
So he makes up
an excuse to get a fix.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.928
Jay, pull up a list
from the NITRO computer.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.598
Everyone arrested for dealing
drugs near Denton University

26:07.630 --> 26:09.325
in the past year.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.668
You're thinking
a drug deal gone wrong?

26:10.700 --> 26:12.167
Sometimes the simplest answer

26:12.200 --> 26:13.360
is the right one.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.799
Thank you, oh, wise one.

26:14.840 --> 26:15.499
Jay.

26:15.540 --> 26:18.031
Okay, we got Annie Cox, age 29.

26:18.070 --> 26:19.332
Currently serving six months
in the Tombs

26:19.370 --> 26:21.634
for possession with intent
to distribute.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.671
Lamar Deaton, A.K.A. Sandman,

26:23.710 --> 26:26.178
35-- just finished
court-ordered rehab.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.019
Lives with his mother in Queens.

26:28.050 --> 26:30.041
And this next gem,
Eddie Codd, 31.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.389
Multiple possession charges.

26:32.420 --> 26:34.217
His last W-2
is from Miller's Grocery

26:34.260 --> 26:37.354
on Jerome Ave.
That's Sam's father's market.

26:45.870 --> 26:47.895
Eddie Codd?

26:47.940 --> 26:49.362
Police. We'd like
to talk to you.

26:50.140 --> 26:51.107
Why do they always run?

26:51.140 --> 26:52.630
Try to keep up, old man!

26:52.670 --> 26:54.877
Who you calling old?

26:58.050 --> 26:59.677
AL:
Cut him off!

27:24.210 --> 27:25.859
Come on, come on.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.133
Took you long enough.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.807
VVhat

27:30.850 --> 27:32.909
You see that?
Not bad

27:32.950 --> 27:34.747
for a guy who only
shaves once a week.

27:34.780 --> 27:38.318
What? Oh, I get it. Because
I called you old back there?

27:38.350 --> 27:40.079
And it's twice a week,
by the way.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.054
Come on.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.348
EDDIE: I swear
I didn't kill Sam.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.062
Hadn't seen him in weeks.
Didn't even know he was dead.

27:51.100 --> 27:54.194
You're lying. We know you sold
to Sam the night he died.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.696
That's not true.

27:56.340 --> 27:58.808
Okay, fine.

27:58.840 --> 28:02.799
Kid came by around 9:00,
but I didn't sell him anything.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.876
So you did see him.
Yeah.

28:04.910 --> 28:07.049
I mean, Sam was tripping out.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.219
Said he needed something
for his nerves, you know?

28:09.250 --> 28:10.740
But he didn't have any money.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.109
I'm not a charity.

28:12.150 --> 28:13.287
_ What was he
tripping out about?
Who knows?

28:13.320 --> 28:14.810
You know? He was on his cell,

28:14.860 --> 28:16.179
screaming at some doctor,

28:16.220 --> 28:17.926
saying how the guy
screwed him over.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.121
I figured that the doc didn't
give him the meds he wanted,

28:20.160 --> 28:21.855
so that's why he came to see me.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.198
Look, all I know is
that the kid was going nuts

28:24.230 --> 28:26.369
and he needed to chill.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.163
This is the way I see it:

28:29.200 --> 28:31.509
you were the last person
to see Sam alive.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.405
How much you want to bet
if we tossed your apartment

28:33.440 --> 28:35.431
right now, we'd find it
full of pharmaceuticals

28:35.480 --> 28:37.846
you are not
supposed to have?

28:37.880 --> 28:39.142
Guy like you...

28:39.180 --> 28:41.819
Two prior convictions.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.148
I couldn't have been
the last one to see Sam.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.839
You know, come to
think of it, Sam said

28:45.890 --> 28:47.346
he was gonna hook up
with someone later that night.

28:47.390 --> 28:49.017
"Come to think of it."

28:49.060 --> 28:50.880
How convenient for you.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.899
No, it's true. Said he had
a big meet by 29th and lst.

28:53.930 --> 28:55.454
Figured he was
scoring some meds,

28:55.500 --> 28:57.968
since it's right
by that hospital.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.025
Which hospital?

29:00.070 --> 29:01.298
Wentley.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.534
I mean, the dude seemed anxious.

29:02.570 --> 29:04.800
What did Sam do in the lab?

29:04.840 --> 29:06.262
HUGHES:
Data entry, mostly.

29:06.310 --> 29:09.734
I'm an infectious disease
speCIalist.

29:10.580 --> 29:13.549
Hughes.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.218
I want to know
what Hughes is hiding.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.343
He said he didn't see Sam--
I think he did.

29:17.380 --> 29:20.042
He's lying.
Let's find out why.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.129
CARRIE:
We'll clear it.

29:46.310 --> 29:48.540
Clear.

29:50.450 --> 29:53.248
I need CSU on scene
at Denton UniverSIty,

29:53.290 --> 29:55.986
the Virus Lab. DOA.

29:57.930 --> 29:58.954
Possible suicide.

29:59.990 --> 30:01.298
Al...

30:03.060 --> 30:05.199
_ There were two canisters
in here, and they're missmg.

30:08.570 --> 30:10.936
One of them
had a biohazard label.

30:10.970 --> 30:13.609
Hughes was an infectious disease
specialist,

30:13.640 --> 30:16.029
so what the hell
was in those canisters?

30:22.080 --> 30:24.184
Auroraevirus.

30:24.220 --> 30:26.984
He was working on a vaccine

30:27.020 --> 30:29.386
for something called
an auroraevirus.

30:29.420 --> 30:32.958
Jay, what can you tell us
about the auroraevirus?

30:35.030 --> 30:37.419
Wow, this virus
is pretty brutal.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.258
There was a lethal outbreak
in Ecuador in 2005.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.598
It's not airborne, but
if you eat or drink the virus,

30:42.640 --> 30:43.937
you'll have flu-like symptoms--

30:43.970 --> 30:45.335
cough, fever--

30:45.370 --> 30:47.600
until the virus kills you
in about ten days.

30:47.640 --> 30:48.868
No known cure.

30:48.910 --> 30:50.605
We gotta find those canisters.

30:52.610 --> 30:54.043
AL:
All right, listen up.

30:54.080 --> 30:54.876
We got to move quickly.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.478
If that virus gets
in the water supply,

30:56.520 --> 30:58.579
we could be facing
a huge epidemic.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.588
We got a ballistics match
on Hughes's gun.

31:00.620 --> 31:01.917
The same gun
that shot Sam.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.656
We found Hughes's car
in the faculty parking lot.
Let me guess,

31:04.690 --> 31:06.521
it had traces
of Sam's blood.
Uh-huh.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.324
So Hughes kills his own student,
then he kills himself.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.521
Or someone kills Hughes
and steals the virus.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.423
I'm tracking down everyone

31:12.470 --> 31:14.961
who had authorized access
to the lab.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.662
Al, security cameras were
shut down in Hughes' office.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.065
We still have no eyes
on who went to the lab

31:19.110 --> 31:20.304
and took the virus.
There has
to be video

31:20.340 --> 31:22.137
of the hallways.
Still waiting

31:22.180 --> 31:23.579
for the university
to send it over.
Get 'em to speed it up!

31:23.610 --> 31:25.146
Come on! Let's go.

31:25.180 --> 31:26.078
CARRIE:
Jo, Sam had

31:26.110 --> 31:28.249
cold symptoms
when he was killed, right?

31:28.280 --> 31:29.975
Is it possible
it was something else?

31:30.020 --> 31:32.045
I was just coming
to find you.

31:32.090 --> 31:35.582
Sam's final blood work came
back, and it wasn't a cold.

31:35.620 --> 31:36.712
The auroraevirus.

31:36.760 --> 31:40.389
Hughes's research only reached
the animal testing phase.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.648
The FDA just recently
denied him approval

31:42.700 --> 31:43.928
for human testing.

31:43.970 --> 31:46.120
So how did Sam get infected?

31:46.170 --> 31:48.968
Let's take a look at what the
police pulled from Hughes's lab.

31:51.140 --> 31:52.164
Okay.

31:52.210 --> 31:55.304
Let's see. Test results,

31:55.340 --> 31:57.308
student evaluations...

31:57.340 --> 31:59.205
farming catalogues...

31:59.250 --> 32:02.947
Wait. Wait, enlarge
those catalogues.
Yeah.

32:17.160 --> 32:20.197
The irrigation system.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.478
Listen to me, Sam wanted

32:31.510 --> 32:34.217
to purify the water
on the island, right?

32:34.250 --> 32:36.639
Let's say he went
to Hughes for help.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.046
That gives Hughes
the perfect opportunity.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.489
Sam brings back the virus,

32:40.520 --> 32:42.750
thinking it's something
to purify the water.

32:42.790 --> 32:45.156
Why would Hughes do that?
He specializes in curing

32:45.190 --> 32:46.521
infectious diseases,
not spreading them.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.528
You said it yourself--

32:48.560 --> 32:52.064
the FDA wouldn_'t
approve human trials.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.432
He needed to find
his very own human lab rats.

32:54.470 --> 32:57.268
Right? He needed to do that
to test his vaccine.

32:57.300 --> 33:00.201
He had to get them sick first,
so he could cure them.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.333
He wanted to be Edward Jenner.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.404
VVho?

33:03.440 --> 33:06.238
Edward Jenner is credited
with curing smallpox,

33:06.280 --> 33:08.646
but in order to do that,
he infected healthy children

33:08.680 --> 33:10.477
to prove his vaccine.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.148
We don't know how many
children died as a result.

33:13.190 --> 33:15.283
Oh, my God.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.015
Hey.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.653
Okay, I'm on my way.

33:20.690 --> 33:23.329
Hey, Jay, what do you got?
Oh.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.521
Hey, Carrie.
So here's the security video

33:25.570 --> 33:28.130
from the university hallway.
Now, the video starts

33:28.170 --> 33:30.365
at the time Hughes'
lab cameras went down.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.099
There. The viral canisters

33:35.140 --> 33:37.199
have to be in his backpack--
right there.

33:41.750 --> 33:42.739
Wait...

33:45.320 --> 33:47.242
That's the guy from Mazurtech.

33:47.290 --> 33:48.484
He's the one who's been
overseeing Hughes'

33:48.520 --> 33:49.714
research grants.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.352
Mazurtech...

33:51.390 --> 33:52.550
Guy's name is

33:52.590 --> 33:55.491
Wendell Kuryak, president
of Mazurtech Pharmaceuticals.

33:55.530 --> 33:57.122
They specialize
in developing vaccines

33:57.160 --> 33:58.525
for diseases
throughout the world.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.162
Or at least
they used to.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.668
Recently filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.406
If Mazurtech
was having financial trouble

34:04.440 --> 34:06.067
and if his company put a lot

34:06.110 --> 34:07.031
of money into
that vaccine,

34:07.070 --> 34:08.628
the next thing
would be to test it, right?

34:08.680 --> 34:10.204
And who better to test it on

34:10.240 --> 34:12.674
than isolated, off-grid kids
on an island?

34:12.710 --> 34:15.645
Which means Kuryak
and Hughes are working together.

34:15.680 --> 34:18.513
I think Hughes
used Sam.

34:18.550 --> 34:20.279
I _think he tric_ked_him
into contaminating

34:20.320 --> 34:21.651
the water supply on the island.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.453
I think Sam found out,

34:23.490 --> 34:25.219
confronted Hughes,
Hughes killed him.

34:25.260 --> 34:27.649
Then, conveniently,
Hughes kills himself.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.329
The virus and the vaccine
are missmg,

34:30.360 --> 34:31.566
which leaves

34:31.600 --> 34:33.864
Kuryak.
His company's reputation--

34:33.900 --> 34:36.460
everything-- is riding
on proving he has the cure.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.105
Where's Kuryak right now?
I'll ping his cell.

34:41.710 --> 34:44.645
Got a GPS signal.
He's in the East River.

34:44.680 --> 34:46.238
Why's he going back
to the island?

34:46.280 --> 34:48.214
He's going to clean up
what's left of his mess.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.520
Kuryak is on the island.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.425
Assume he's armed and dangerous.

35:07.470 --> 35:09.631
OFFICERS:
Go! Move! Move!

35:09.670 --> 35:11.558
Stay back!

35:11.610 --> 35:13.237
You gotta trust me.

35:13.270 --> 35:14.407
You gotta believe me.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.577
I'm here to help.
Shut up!

35:15.610 --> 35:16.372
Shut up!
But, no, look,
when I found out

35:16.410 --> 35:17.707
what that maniac
Hughes was doing--

35:17.740 --> 35:19.503
using Sam to try and
poison you kids...

35:19.550 --> 35:21.745
You're lying.
Sam would never hurt us.
I had to do something.

35:21.780 --> 35:23.543
AL: Kuryak, stop!
Give it up!

35:23.580 --> 35:25.719
They're trying to poison us!
Louisa, run.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.209
Al, she's got the vaccine
and the virus.

35:29.260 --> 35:30.579
AL:
Don't let him go.

35:30.620 --> 35:33.259
He's lying about Hughes.
He's in on it!

35:33.290 --> 35:35.121
AL: All right, stay with them.
Stay with them.

35:39.270 --> 35:42.433
Louisa, come back!
That medicine can help you!

35:43.400 --> 35:46.369
Louisa! Louisa, wait!

35:46.410 --> 35:48.605
AL:
I can't see a thing.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.745
CARRIE:
Wait a second.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.719
LOUISA:
Watch your step.

35:55.750 --> 35:58.742
Just stay with me, Al.
Come this way.

36:07.690 --> 36:08.657
Be careful.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.362
There's a big hole here.
Stay close to the wall.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.823
It's right here.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.861
Stay up against
the wall, okay?

36:21.280 --> 36:22.577
This place is like a maze.
Stay with me.

36:22.610 --> 36:24.441
She's headed for the garden.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.314
Wait. No, it's...
it's this way.

36:33.350 --> 36:35.352
Stay to the right.

36:47.270 --> 36:48.760
I got it.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.709
CARRIE: Louisa...
Stay back.

36:51.740 --> 36:52.764
Hey.

36:52.810 --> 36:56.530
I'm just here to help, okay?

36:57.780 --> 36:59.645
No, I have to destroy
the poison.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.999
No, no, no, look...

37:01.050 --> 37:03.575
Stay back!
Look, look... I am.
Look at me.

37:03.620 --> 37:06.919
That's not poison.
What you have-- right there--

37:06.950 --> 37:09.487
is a cure that can save you

37:09.520 --> 37:11.659
and your friends.
No.

37:11.690 --> 37:13.658
You're just like everyone else.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.658
Why are you trying
to hurt us?

37:15.700 --> 37:17.452
I'm not trying to hurt you.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.728
Look at me.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.658
Louisa,

37:20.700 --> 37:22.736
I'm not like everyone else.

37:22.770 --> 37:24.601
I'm not.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.868
You can trust me.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.832
No...

37:27.870 --> 37:29.599
Why should I trust you?

37:29.640 --> 37:32.643
Because you and me,
we're... we're a lot alike.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.739
Listen, I know
what it's like

37:34.780 --> 37:37.817
to feel alone and different.

37:37.850 --> 37:39.715
I do.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.457
I mean,
I think you're brave.

37:42.490 --> 37:45.755
I wish I'd been brave enough to
find my own island to live on.

37:47.760 --> 37:48.920
But they killed Sam.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.497
Yes, they killed Sam.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.998
Don't let them kill you, too.

37:54.030 --> 37:55.668
Sam would want you to live.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.828
Louisa, look at me.
Look at me.

37:58.870 --> 38:02.601
I promise you that what
you're holding in your hands

38:02.640 --> 38:05.643
is a cure that can save you
and your friends.

38:05.680 --> 38:08.649
Please trust me.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.875
Please help us.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.285
Okay.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.851
WEBSTER:
Her viral levels

38:23.900 --> 38:26.721
plummeted once we
started treatment.

38:26.770 --> 38:28.738
Louisa and her friends
are gang to make

38:28.770 --> 38:29.862
a full recovery
within weeks.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.094
That's great.

38:31.140 --> 38:32.368
WEBSTER:
It's ironic, really.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.878
The antiviral worked,

38:34.910 --> 38:36.730
but Hughes and Kuryak
will never see

38:36.780 --> 38:39.078
the fruits of their labor.

38:39.110 --> 38:40.771
You coming?

38:40.810 --> 38:41.913
No.

38:41.950 --> 38:43.872
I'm gonna hang out here
for a bit.

38:46.850 --> 38:47.817
Hey.

38:47.850 --> 38:50.887
Hi.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.922
How are you feeling?

38:52.960 --> 38:55.656
A little sore, I guess.
But okay.

38:55.700 --> 38:56.758
Good.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.427
Is everyone else...

38:58.470 --> 38:59.789
Everyone's gonna be okay.

38:59.830 --> 39:01.536
It's gonna
work out fine.

39:01.570 --> 39:03.492
You know, you were
really brave back there.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.701
You kept your word.

39:05.740 --> 39:06.900
You saved us.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.602
I like to think Sam saved you.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.073
If he hadn't
left the island

39:11.110 --> 39:13.874
and tried to figure out
what was going on,

39:13.910 --> 39:15.571
we would never
have found you, you know?

39:16.820 --> 39:18.048
Yeah.

39:18.080 --> 39:21.015
Sam's watching out for you.

39:21.050 --> 39:23.518
He always did.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.551
Get some rest, okay?

39:28.930 --> 39:30.522
Hey.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.390
AL: Hey.

39:31.430 --> 39:32.920
The CDC has the canister
with the virus.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.119
It's completely contained.

39:34.170 --> 39:35.831
Great.
What about Kuryak?

39:35.870 --> 39:37.895
He's lawyered up, but it's
not gonna do him any good.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.864
Gunshot residue on his fingers
matches Hughes' gun.

39:40.910 --> 39:43.731
Kuryak shot him and made
it look like a suicide.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.805
He's going away
for a long time.
Best news of all,

39:45.850 --> 39:48.944
I don't have to deal with
the Tourist Board anymore.
Oh, well,

39:48.980 --> 39:50.914
it's good to see you've got your
priorities straight, Eliot.

39:50.950 --> 39:53.043
Eye on the prize.

39:56.090 --> 39:57.079
What?

39:57.120 --> 39:58.826
Nothing.
What?

39:58.860 --> 40:00.020
Well...

40:00.060 --> 40:02.597
What is it?
Oh, I was just thinking--

40:02.630 --> 40:05.167
if I were heading to
a deserted island,

40:05.200 --> 40:06.895
I'd take you.

40:06.930 --> 40:08.022
That's sweet.

40:08.070 --> 40:10.493
Well, 'cause you'd be able
to remember all the stuff

40:10.540 --> 40:11.700
I'd need to survive.

40:11.740 --> 40:14.777
You're like a walking
Swiss Army knife.

40:14.810 --> 40:16.937
Well, that's not... so sweet.

40:16.980 --> 40:19.005
But, you know, if I...

40:19.050 --> 40:21.712
was headed to
a deserted island,

40:21.750 --> 40:23.877
I'd take something warm.
Yeah?

40:23.920 --> 40:26.081
'Cause at nighttime it can
get cold and I would need to...

40:26.120 --> 40:28.657
heat up.

40:28.690 --> 40:29.952
Yeah.

40:31.590 --> 40:32.852
I'd take matches.

40:32.890 --> 40:35.450
To make a fire. You know?

40:35.500 --> 40:36.649
Yeah.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.588
Matches.
