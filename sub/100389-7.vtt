-MATT: Ask yourself:
"Do I really need

25:33.490 --> 25:34.991
more than one pair of pants?"

25:35.075 --> 25:36.368
Well done, Captain.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.205
Thank you. Yep, I think it's...

25:40.288 --> 25:42.082
(ENGLISH ACCENT)
probably time for a drink.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.709
No time! We don't have time!

25:44.793 --> 25:46.920
That's not enough time to learn
how to dock the ship!

25:47.003 --> 25:49.130
Even I couldn't learn it
in six months,

25:49.214 --> 25:50.882
and I'm so much smarter
than you.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.802
-That is not enough time
to learn how to dock a ship--
-That's not enough time!

25:53.885 --> 25:54.761
-Six months?
-No!

25:54.844 --> 25:56.513
-What am I thinking?
-No! Oh my god!

25:56.596 --> 25:58.515
I need years!

25:59.933 --> 26:02.060
Hey. What's the matter?
Why are you acting like

26:02.143 --> 26:03.853
a little foster child
with a secret?

26:03.937 --> 26:07.399
Okay, the Captain now has
only got six months
to learn how to dock the ship.

26:07.482 --> 26:08.858
-That is not enough time.
-What?!

26:08.942 --> 26:11.111
It took me longer than that
to learn how to poach an egg.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.279
BILLIE: Well, let's just hope

26:12.362 --> 26:14.614
that you are really,
really good with deadlines.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.034
The only thing I hear there
is "dead."

26:18.118 --> 26:21.079
You know what? I take back
what I said to you before.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.415
You're not Captain Schmooze.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.834
You're more like Captain Booze.
