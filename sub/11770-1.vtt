00:23.467 --> 00:24.700
HOW COME
YOU'RE DOING THAT ?

00:24.733 --> 00:26.967
NO REASON.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.400
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO REASON,
YOU GOT TO HAVE A REASON.

00:28.433 --> 00:29.467

00:31.900 --> 00:32.900
YOU'RE GIVING UP
RED MEAT,

00:32.933 --> 00:35.600
THERE HAS TO BE SOME
MOTIVATION BEHIND IT.

00:35.633 --> 00:37.433
NO REASON.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.367
GONNA INVEST

INVESTMENT.

00:55.367 --> 00:56.667

01:14.767 --> 01:17.067
YEAH, THAT'S
MY GARBAGE CAN.

01:17.067 --> 01:18.133
SO, IT'S GARBAGE.

01:18.167 --> 01:19.933
I APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT.

01:19.967 --> 01:21.667
DOESN'T GARBAGE BELONG
IN A GARBAGE CAN ?

01:21.700 --> 01:24.600
YEAH, MY GARBAGE BELONGS
IN MY GARBAGE CAN.

01:24.633 --> 01:27.067
YOUR GARBAGE BELONGS
IN YOUR GARBAGE CAN, OKAY ?

01:27.067 --> 01:28.300
WELL, WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE ?

01:28.333 --> 01:29.333
THE DIFFERENCE ?

01:29.367 --> 01:30.467
IT'S MINE.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.067
YOUR CAN'S NOT FULL,

01:32.100 --> 01:34.333

GARBAGE IN THERE,

01:34.367 --> 01:36.067
I'M GONNA

01:36.067 --> 01:38.067
I'LL GIVE THAT MESSAGE
TO THE NEXT GUY.

01:38.067 --> 01:39.200
YOU THINK
I'M KIDDING ?

01:39.233 --> 01:40.700

02:04.333 --> 02:07.367
WELL, YOU KNOW,

HOW'S EVERYTHING ?

02:14.867 --> 02:16.067
GOOD.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.567
I MEAN, SHE'S TALKED
ABOUT CHET THE WHOLE TIME.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.267
DID YOU ASK HER ABOUT
THE PICTURE FRAME ?

02:21.300 --> 02:22.600
NO.

02:22.633 --> 02:23.833
HOW CAN I ASK HER
ABOUT THE PICTURE ?

02:23.867 --> 02:26.667
SHE'S BEEN LIKE THAT
ALL AFTERNOON.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.833
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS THING.

02:28.867 --> 02:32.200
YOU GAVE HER THIS PICTURE,
YOU KNOW, FIVE MONTHS AGO,

02:32.233 --> 02:34.300
ALL SHE'S GOT TO DO IS
GET A FRAME ON IT, AND, AND...

02:34.333 --> 02:35.533
ALRIGHT,
I'LL ASK HER.

02:35.567 --> 02:38.400
HER HUSBAND'S BEEN DEAD
FOR FOUR MONTHS NOW, I MEAN...

02:38.433 --> 02:41.067
I'LL BRING IT UP
BEFORE WE GO.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.200
OKAY, I THINK,
YEAH, THESE ARE THE ONES.

02:43.233 --> 02:44.600

02:49.533 --> 02:51.500
BUT THEN JUST TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.467
BOY, I LOVE
THIS SHIRT.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.733
ISN'T THAT
A GREAT PICTURE ?

02:54.767 --> 02:55.933
OH.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.733
THAT IS EXACTLY THE KIND
OF SHIRT THAT I WOULD WEAR,

02:57.767 --> 02:59.233
DON'T YOU THINK ?

02:59.267 --> 03:01.067
MM-HMM.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.767
DID YOU TAKE
THAT HERE ?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.733
YEAH, IT WAS JUST RIGHT
IN THE BACKYARD.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.500
I MEAN, DOESN'T
HE LOOK HEALTHY, LARRY ?

03:06.533 --> 03:08.133
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE GOT THIS ?

03:08.167 --> 03:10.167
I DON'T REMEMBER.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.067
NO IDEA ?

03:13.067 --> 03:15.433
I JUST,
I DON'T REMEMBER.

03:15.467 --> 03:17.067
I LOVE
THAT PICTURE.

03:17.067 --> 03:18.133
( Cheryl )
IT'S NICE.

03:18.167 --> 03:20.500
COULD IT HAVE BEEN,
COULD IT HAVE BEEN THE MALL

03:20.533 --> 03:22.633
OR THE PROMENADE ?

03:23.300 --> 03:25.200
NO, BUT I'LL...

03:26.433 --> 03:27.767
THINK ABOUT IT.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.567
SO, YOU--
OKAY.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.100
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR LUNCH.

03:34.133 --> 03:37.200
THAT WAS REALLY GREAT.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.100
WAS IT
IN SANTA MONICA ?

03:39.133 --> 03:40.300
I DON'T KNOW.

03:40.333 --> 03:41.400
YOU DON'T KNOW.

03:41.433 --> 03:43.300
YOU DON'T KNOW,
OKAY, ALRIGHT.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.933
IT'S JUST IT'S SUCH
A GREAT LOOKING SHIRT.

03:45.967 --> 03:48.067
IT'S CARUSO'S,
YEAH, IT WAS CARUSO'S.

03:48.067 --> 03:51.067
ON WILSHIRE BOULEVARD,
YES, OF COURSE !

03:51.067 --> 03:53.900
CARUSO'S, GREAT.
THAT'S A NICE PICTURE.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.433
I LOVE IT.

03:55.467 --> 03:56.933
ALRIGHT, WELL,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE OFF.

03:56.967 --> 03:58.700
I'M GONNA STOP OFF
AT CARUSO'S

03:58.733 --> 04:00.767
AND GET THAT SHIRT,
I THINK.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.267
I WONDER IF IT COMES
IN ANY OTHER COLORS.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.333
SEE YOU.

04:03.367 --> 04:08.533
AND JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN
ABOUT THE FRAME,

04:08.567 --> 04:10.400
THE PICTURE THAT
YOU WERE GONNA FRAME.

04:10.433 --> 04:11.633
YEAH.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.300
HOW'S THAT GOING ?

04:13.333 --> 04:14.867
I DON'T KNOW.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.133
OKAY, 'CAUSE IT'S KIND OF BEEN
LIKE FIVE MONTHS, YOU KNOW ?

04:17.167 --> 04:20.833
AND WE WERE
JUST WONDERING.

04:20.867 --> 04:23.367
MY HUSBAND
DROPPED DEAD.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.700
YEAH, THAT WAS
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

04:24.733 --> 04:25.733
OKAY.

04:25.767 --> 04:29.500
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
JUST SOME DETAILS

04:29.533 --> 04:31.600
THAT I HAD
TO TAKE CARE OF, RIGHT ?

04:31.633 --> 04:32.733
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF YOU...

04:32.767 --> 04:36.067
GOD FORBID IT SHOULD
EVER HAPPEN TO YOU, CHERYL.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.767
I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD
BE THINKING ABOUT...

04:37.800 --> 04:40.067
SHE'D BE DANCING AROUND
THE TREVI FOUNTAINS IN ROME,

04:40.067 --> 04:42.633
I THINK IF--
THAT'S JUST A JOKE.

04:42.667 --> 04:43.967
I'M SORRY.

04:44.067 --> 04:47.533
I'M JUST NOT READY
TO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR

04:47.567 --> 04:48.767
ABOUT THIS,
YOU KNOW ?

04:48.800 --> 04:51.433
I UNDERSTAND, I'M SORRY,
YOU TAKE CARE.

04:51.467 --> 04:53.633
THANK YOU FOR THE LUNCH
AND THE CATALOGS.

04:53.667 --> 04:54.633
YEAH.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.167
SO, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS PLACE, ANYWAY ?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.700
BOBO'S.

05:00.733 --> 05:01.967
BOBO'S ?

05:02.067 --> 05:03.300
I LIKE THAT.

05:07.533 --> 05:08.633
TED.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.933
JEFF, HEY.

05:10.967 --> 05:12.500
ARE YOU
IN ON THIS, TOO ?

05:12.533 --> 05:13.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

05:13.700 --> 05:14.667
YOU'RE THROWING
YOUR MONEY AWAY ON THIS ?

05:14.700 --> 05:15.767
WHY NOT, WHY NOT ?

05:15.800 --> 05:17.067
REALLY ?

05:17.100 --> 05:18.833
EVER DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THIS ?

05:18.867 --> 05:21.767
I ONCE INVESTED
IN A WHORE HOUSE.

05:22.633 --> 05:24.500
I MADE A FORTUNE
ON THAT PLACE.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.600
HOW ARE YOU ?

05:25.633 --> 05:27.200
I'M GREAT, MAN,
I'M GREAT.

05:27.233 --> 05:28.733
HOW'S MARY DOING ?

05:28.767 --> 05:29.800
OH, SHE'S GOOD.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.767
SHE'S IN AUSTRALIA
SHOOTING THAT FILM STILL.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.867
WHICH IS TOO BAD,
BECAUSE SHE'S GOING CRAZY.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.133
SHE'S MISSING
JILL'S BIRTHDAY.

05:36.167 --> 05:38.700
WHICH REMINDS ME,
A WEEK FROM SUNDAY,

05:38.733 --> 05:39.833
THE BIRTHDAY PARTY
FOR JILL.

05:39.867 --> 05:40.900
I'M ALL OVER IT.

05:40.933 --> 05:41.933
YOU'RE COMING.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.067
ALL SET.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.300
ALRIGHT, HERE'S
THE EMBARRASSING PART,

05:44.333 --> 05:47.167
WE PROMISED HER
A "WIZARD OF OZ"
KIND OF PARTY THING.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.967
SO, I'M GOING TO
DO A SCARECROW.

05:49.067 --> 05:51.233
IF I GOT YOU THE COSTUME,
WOULD YOU DO, I DON'T KNOW,

05:51.267 --> 05:52.400
ONE OF THEM,
THE LION ?

05:52.433 --> 05:54.700
LION, SURE.

05:54.733 --> 05:57.667
HIM, WELL, I DO
AN UNBELIEVABLE LION.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.100
WELL, I GOT TO DO THE LION,
THOUGH, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH.

06:00.133 --> 06:03.533
LET ME DO THE LION,
YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.

06:03.567 --> 06:04.767
A FAT TIN MAN ?

06:04.800 --> 06:08.233
I WON'T COME
IF I HAVE TO DO THE TIN MAN.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.233
LET HIM DO IT.

06:09.267 --> 06:10.467
YOU CAN BE THE LION.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.433
I'LL BE THE FAT TIN MAN
THAT'LL DISAPPOINT CHILDREN.

06:12.467 --> 06:13.833
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO FOR DOROTHY ?

06:13.867 --> 06:15.633
WHAT ABOUT CHERYL,
WOULD SHE COME ?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.100
CHERYL COULD
DO DOROTHY.

06:17.133 --> 06:18.167
SHE WOULD LOVE TO.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.467
GREAT, THANK YOU.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.167
I'LL GET THE COSTUMES AND EVERY,
THIS IS REALLY NICE.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.800
YEAH, YOU LIKE THIS ?

06:23.833 --> 06:25.067
YOU GOT GREAT TASTE,
WHERE'D YOU GET IT ?

06:25.067 --> 06:28.567
I GOT IT, ACTUALLY
I SAW A DEAD GUY'S PICTURE.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.133
EVERYBODY,
LARRY DAVID.

06:30.167 --> 06:32.233
HEY, MICHAEL YORK,
HOW YOU DOING ?

06:32.267 --> 06:33.333
GLAD TO MEET YOU.

06:33.367 --> 06:36.067
MICHAEL'S HERE
TO CLASS UP OUR ACT.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.100
LOU DIMAGIO.

06:37.133 --> 06:38.100
HELLO,
HOW ARE YOU DOING ?

06:38.133 --> 06:39.567
NICE TO MEET YOU,
LARRY.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.067
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.833
I'LL BE MANAGING
THE RESTAURANT.

06:42.867 --> 06:44.067
JIM SWENSON.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.100
HI, JIM, OH, YOU WERE
THE MANAGER OF GUS'S.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.100
YES, I WAS.

06:46.133 --> 06:47.133
THERESA NAKAMORA.

06:47.167 --> 06:48.167
HELLO, HI, THERESA.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.833
I WAS AT GUS'S, TOO.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.167
LET'S SIT,
LET'S SIT.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.967
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA
COME IN ON THIS.

06:56.067 --> 06:59.267
IT SOUNDS INTRIGUING,
I HAVE TO SAY.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.233
WE HAVE A VERY
EXCITING PLACE HERE,

07:02.267 --> 07:03.733
THE LOCATION
IS PERFECT.

07:03.767 --> 07:06.333
AND WE GOT GREAT IDEAS
FOR A NEW RESTAURANT

07:06.367 --> 07:08.200
THAT IT'S GOING
TO BE A HIT.

07:08.233 --> 07:10.833
WELL, I KNOW ONE THING,
I WILL NOT BE GIVING

07:10.867 --> 07:14.933
YOU PEOPLE ANY MONEY
IF YOU SERVE KABOBS.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.067
YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT?

07:16.067 --> 07:17.367
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.433
I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE KABOBS.

07:18.467 --> 07:20.067
WHY ARE YOU
A KABOBAPHOBE ?

07:20.067 --> 07:21.100
I JUST CAN'T
STAND KABOBS.

07:21.133 --> 07:22.467
"KABOBAPHOBE" ?

07:22.500 --> 07:25.167
HAVE YOU HAD A BAD
EXPERIENCE WITH KABOBS,
WHAT HAPPENED ?

07:25.200 --> 07:27.133
JUST WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING
THEM OFF THE STICK.

07:27.167 --> 07:30.067
I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
OF THE STICK, FRANKLY.

07:30.067 --> 07:31.867
NO KABOBS.

07:34.067 --> 07:36.333
OH, HOW ABOUT THIS,
HOW ABOUT THIS IDEA ?

07:36.367 --> 07:39.800
I FEEL THAT YOU CAN NEVER
GET A WAITER'S ATTENTION.

07:39.833 --> 07:43.867
SO, I'M SUGGESTING
THAT EVERY TABLE

07:43.900 --> 07:46.567
SHOULD HAVE
A BELL ON IT.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.400
AND SO, WHEN YOU
WANT THE WAITER,
YOU JUST RING A BELL--

07:49.433 --> 07:50.400
WELL, WHAT IF LIKE
THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE

07:50.433 --> 07:51.767
ARE RINGING THE THING
AT ONCE ?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.067
LIKE, HOW DOES
THEIR WAITER KNOW...

07:53.100 --> 07:55.100
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, EVERY WAITER
COULD HAVE THEIR OWN TONE.

07:55.133 --> 07:56.300
SO, YOU CAN IDENTIFY.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.833
SO, WHEN THE WAITER HEARS
DING, DING, DING,

07:57.867 --> 07:59.533
THEY KNOW IT'S HIM.

07:59.567 --> 08:02.100
AND IF THEN IF IT'S
DING, DING, DING,
A LOWER TONE--

08:02.133 --> 08:03.400
A BELL ?

08:03.433 --> 08:05.900
THEY WOULD ANSWER TO A BELL
LIKE A PAVLOVIAN DOG ?

08:05.933 --> 08:07.300
IT'S LIKE A BUTLER,
IT'S LIKE A BUTLER BELL.

08:07.333 --> 08:10.067
EXACTLY, I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE NOT ON BOARD WITH THAT,

08:10.067 --> 08:11.900
IT'S ENGLISH,
IT'S A BUTLER BELL.

08:11.933 --> 08:13.633
MICHAEL YORK,
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

08:13.667 --> 08:16.733
I'M SO APPALLED BY THE IDEA
THAT I'M STRUCK DUMB.

08:16.767 --> 08:19.433
MICHAEL, IT'S A GOOD IDEA,
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:19.467 --> 08:21.067
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU HAVE ?

08:21.067 --> 08:22.967
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR THE WAITERS' UNIFORMS ?

08:23.067 --> 08:26.467
WE HAVE A VERY TASTEFUL
WHITE SHIRT, DARK SLACKS.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.067
AND, NAME TAGS.

08:28.067 --> 08:29.300
NO GOOD, HUH ?

08:29.333 --> 08:31.267
OH BOY, I THINK WE CAN
DO BETTER THAN THAT, NO ?

08:31.300 --> 08:32.500
LARRY, WHAT DO
YOU ENVISION ?

08:32.533 --> 08:34.967
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

08:35.067 --> 08:36.867
I'LL GO SHOPPING
FOR UNIFORMS.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.100
YOU'LL COME WITH ME.

08:38.133 --> 08:39.700
I AM THERE WITH YOU
TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS.

08:39.733 --> 08:41.433
ALRIGHT,
SO GIVE US A CHOICE.

08:41.467 --> 08:42.633
YEAH, I'LL COME BACK
WITH SOMETHING

08:42.667 --> 08:43.867
YOU'LL BE VERY,
VERY HAPPY WITH.

08:43.900 --> 08:44.967
IS EVEBODY GOOD WITH THAT,
I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.200
SO, YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF THE UNIFORMS, OKAY.

08:47.233 --> 08:49.067
SO, YOU'RE IN.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.767
WELCOME ABOARD.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.067
MAYBE.

08:59.067 --> 09:00.967
SO, WE'RE DEFINITELY
DOING THIS ?

09:01.067 --> 09:02.767
IT'S RIGHT ON OCEAN,
IT'S IN A GREAT LOCATION.

09:02.800 --> 09:03.833
THEY'VE GOT
A GREAT CHEF.

09:03.867 --> 09:05.833
THEY COULDN'T FIND
SOMEBODY ELSE TO INVEST ?

09:05.867 --> 09:07.700
THERE ARE TONS OF
PEOPLE WITH MONEY IN--

09:07.733 --> 09:10.100
WELL, MAYBE THEY COULD,
BUT I'M LUCKY I WAS ASKED.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.600
I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT
LIKE A GOOD THING.

09:11.633 --> 09:12.600
WE CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
FROM THIS, MAYBE.

09:12.633 --> 09:14.067
OH, I HOPE SO.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.500
BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT,
IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT THE MONEY.

09:15.533 --> 09:16.533
WHAT IS THE POINT ?

09:16.567 --> 09:18.100
YOU KNOW, WE COULD
HANG OUT THERE,

09:18.133 --> 09:21.833
PEOPLE WOULD COME IN
AND I'LL WALK AROUND
AND GO TO A TABLE,

09:21.867 --> 09:23.067
"ARE YOU ENJOYING
YOUR MEAL ?"

09:23.067 --> 09:24.767
YOU'RE GOING TO
WALK AROUND ?

09:24.800 --> 09:27.633
THIS IS WHY YOU WANT TO DO THIS,
SO, YOU CAN CHAT WITH PEOPLE ?

09:27.667 --> 09:29.600
"HOW'S EVERYTHING,
ARE YOU ENJOYING IT ?"

09:29.633 --> 09:31.900
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE TALKING TO PEOPLE.

09:31.933 --> 09:33.900
I DON'T LIKE TALKING
TO PEOPLE I KNOW.

09:33.933 --> 09:36.767
BUT STRANGERS,
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH.

09:36.800 --> 09:37.900
I THINK
IT'LL BE FUN.

09:37.933 --> 09:40.300
I WAS PUT
IN CHARGE OF UNIFORMS.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.133
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
I'M VERY INTERESTED IN.

09:42.167 --> 09:43.567
I ALWAYS WONDERED, HOW DO
THEY CHOOSE THE UNIFORMS ?

09:43.600 --> 09:44.700
WHO CHOOSES
THE UNIFORMS ?

09:44.733 --> 09:46.100
WELL, I'M GOING TO
CHOOSE THE UNIFORMS.

09:46.133 --> 09:48.267
I'M GOING
SHOPPING WITH JEFF

09:48.300 --> 09:49.867
TO PICK OUT UNIFORMS
FOR THE WAITERS.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.233
THAT'S WHY YOU WANT
TO DO THIS ?

09:51.267 --> 09:54.133
SO, YOU CAN PICK OUT
UNIFORMS FOR...

09:54.167 --> 09:56.567
WELL, IT'S NOT ONLY UNIFORMS,
YOU'RE MAKING OTHER DECISIONS.

09:56.600 --> 10:02.233
I ASKED ABOUT, WE'RE GONNA
GET SWEET POTATOES ON THE MENU.

10:02.267 --> 10:03.833
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T GET
SWEET POTATOES ANYWHERE,

10:03.867 --> 10:05.367
HAVEN'T YOU
NOTICED THAT ?

10:05.400 --> 10:06.633
EVERYBODY'S
NOTICED THAT.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.967
I HAVE THIS GREAT IDEA
ABOUT BELLS FOR THE TABLE,

10:09.000 --> 10:10.467
BECAUSE YOU CAN
NEVER SUMMON WAITERS,

10:10.500 --> 10:12.467
THEY NEVER COME
WHEN YOU WANT THEM.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.067
DID YOU BRING THIS UP
AT THE MEETING ?

10:14.100 --> 10:15.400
AND HOW DID
THAT GO OVER ?

10:15.433 --> 10:16.567
I THINK IT
WENT OVER OKAY.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.633
THEY LIKED
THAT IDEA ?

10:17.667 --> 10:18.733
YEAH, I THINK
THEY DID.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.600
PEOPLE RINGING BELLS
ALL OVER THE RESTAURANT ?

10:20.633 --> 10:22.133
YEAH.

10:22.167 --> 10:24.067
IS THAT A NEW SHIRT ?

10:24.100 --> 10:27.900
YEAH, THIS IS THE SHIRT THAT
CHET WAS WEARING IN THE PICTURE.

10:27.933 --> 10:29.667
AT BARBARA'S HOUSE ?

10:29.700 --> 10:31.500
I WENT TO CARUSO'S
AND GOT IT.

10:31.533 --> 10:32.733
THEY HAD THREE LEFT.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.033
REALLY ?
YEAH.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.433
YOU WENT SHOPPING ?

10:35.467 --> 10:37.000
I DID,
I LOVE THE SHIRT.

10:37.033 --> 10:38.567
AND TED DANSON
LIKED IT, TOO.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.267
I'M GETTING A LOT
OF COMPLIMENTS ON IT.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.533
IT LOOKS GOOD.

10:41.567 --> 10:43.867
COME ON, FEEL THIS MATERIAL,
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.367
SO, BARBARA SAID SHE'S GOING
TO HAVE THAT FRAME READY

10:46.400 --> 10:47.367
FOR US NEXT WEEK.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.367
OH, GOOD, SEE ?

10:48.400 --> 10:49.367
SEE ?

10:49.400 --> 10:50.700
IT PAID FOR ME
TO OPEN MY MOUTH.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.967
AND YOUR DENTIST CALLED

10:52.000 --> 10:54.633
AND WANTS US OVER
FOR DINNER SATURDAY.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.100
DR. BLOURE ?

10:57.133 --> 10:58.167
YEAH.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.400
WANTS TO HAVE US
FOR DINNER ?

10:59.433 --> 11:00.633
YEAH.

11:00.667 --> 11:04.567
I THOUGHT THAT YOU'D
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.567
HE'S MY DENTIST, WHY IS
HE CALLING ME FOR DINNER ?

11:07.600 --> 11:09.967
I DON'T KNOW.

11:10.067 --> 11:12.067
WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA
TALK ABOUT, MY TEETH ?

11:12.067 --> 11:14.067
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY,

11:14.067 --> 11:15.533
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
TALKED ABOUT IT.

11:15.567 --> 11:17.133
NO, I NEVER MENTIONED
ANYTHING TO HIM

11:17.167 --> 11:18.267
ABOUT GETTING
TOGETHER SOCIALLY.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.200
I WOULDN'T MIX SOCIAL
AND PROFESSIONAL,

11:20.233 --> 11:22.733
THAT'S A TERRIBLE
COMBINATION.

11:22.767 --> 11:25.133
WELL, I'M JUST GONNA
TELL HIM THAT

11:25.167 --> 11:27.100
WE'RE GOING OUT OF
TOWN OR SOMETHING.

11:27.133 --> 11:28.200
OKAY.

11:28.233 --> 11:29.667
BECAUSE IF WE GO OVER
TO HIS HOUSE FOR DINNER,

11:29.700 --> 11:31.333
THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE
INVITE HIM SOMEPLACE,

11:31.367 --> 11:33.333
AND IF WE DON'T INVITE HIM
THEN HE'S GONNA BE OFFENDED.

11:33.367 --> 11:36.067
THEN THE NEXT TIME I GO THERE
THERE'S GONNA BE TENSION.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.800
I INVITED YOU,
WHY DIDN'T YOU INVITE ME ?

11:37.833 --> 11:38.867
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN ?

11:38.900 --> 11:40.067
WE DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO THAT GAME.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.533
MM-MMM.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.200
I'LL NEED A NEW DENTIST SOON,
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

11:46.233 --> 11:49.467
THAT'S THE END OF THIS DENTIST
FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.200
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S ALREADY RUINED,

11:51.233 --> 11:54.567
THE WHOLE THING, AH,
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO GET TOGETHER.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.833
GOT TO GET TOGETHER.

11:55.867 --> 11:57.333
THE WHOLE WORLD'S
GOT TO GET TOGETHER.

12:01.267 --> 12:02.700
HEY.

12:02.733 --> 12:04.400
HOW ABOUT THIS ?

12:04.433 --> 12:06.133
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
THE WAITERS TO WEAR ?

12:06.167 --> 12:08.167
YEAH, WHY NOT ?

12:08.200 --> 12:10.467
SO, YOU WANT THE WAITERS
TO DRESS LIKE YOU ?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.067
WHY IS THAT BAD ?

12:12.067 --> 12:15.267
MAN, YOU'RE
OUT OF CONTROL.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.500
NO, THEY SHOULD WALK AROUND
LOOKING LIKE YOU.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.067
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.667
WHAT ABOUT THIS ?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.800
HEY, WHAT ABOUT THIS ?

12:24.833 --> 12:26.167
COME ON.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.200
IT LOOKS LIKE
A TABLECLOTH, RIGHT ?

12:27.233 --> 12:28.200
YEAH.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.433
YEAH ?
YEAH.

12:29.467 --> 12:32.067
SO, THE WAITERS SHIRTS
MATCH THE TABLECLOTH.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.867
AND ?

12:33.900 --> 12:35.433
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"AND" ?

12:35.467 --> 12:36.933
THAT'S INTERESTING.

12:36.967 --> 12:39.067
YEAH.
INTERESTING ?

12:40.733 --> 12:42.800
I'M NOT
FINDING ANYTHING.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.433
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE,
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.600
I'M GONNA GET,
REMEMBER THAT SHIRT

12:46.633 --> 12:48.600
I WAS WEARING THE OTHER DAY
THAT TED DANSON REALLY LIKED ?

12:48.633 --> 12:49.700
THAT CREAM SHIRT ?

12:49.733 --> 12:50.767
YEAH, WITH THE BLACK ?

12:50.800 --> 12:51.967
I THINK I'M GONNA
GET THAT FOR HIM.

12:52.067 --> 12:53.167
THAT'S NICE.
I GOT IT HERE.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.400
THAT'S VERY NICE.

12:54.433 --> 12:56.500
I MIGHT EVEN GET
ANOTHER ONE FOR ME.

12:56.533 --> 12:57.500
WHY ?

12:57.533 --> 12:58.933
'CAUSE I ALWAYS
RUIN MY SHIRTS.

12:58.967 --> 13:01.100
I STAIN THEM
AND I LIKE IT,

13:01.133 --> 13:02.333
IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO HAVE AN EXTRA ONE.

13:02.367 --> 13:04.567
IS IT CRAZY TO HAVE
TWO OF THE SAME SHIRT ?

13:04.600 --> 13:06.100
NO, IT'S FINE.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.633
YOU GET A STAIN ON IT,
YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE.

13:09.733 --> 13:10.700
EXCUSE ME.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.067
YES, SIR ?

13:12.067 --> 13:13.133
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER ME,
I WAS IN A COUPLE DAYS AGO,

13:13.167 --> 13:14.667
I BOUGHT THAT
TWO-TONE SHIRT.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.167
YOU SAID YOU HAD THREE
IN THE BASEMENT.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.500
YEAH, THE CREAM AND BLACK,
I REMEMBER, YEAH.

13:18.533 --> 13:19.933
I WANT TO GET
THE OTHER TWO.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.500
JUST GIVE ME
ONE SECOND.

13:29.067 --> 13:30.533
CHECK THAT OUT.

13:30.567 --> 13:31.600
MAN, SHE IS HOT.

13:31.633 --> 13:33.100
LOOK AT THAT SHIRT.

13:33.133 --> 13:34.167
IS THAT A BEAUTY ?

13:34.200 --> 13:35.967
THE EPAULETS,
LOOK AT THE EPAULETS.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.233
IT'S A MILITARY SHIRT.

13:37.267 --> 13:39.600
YES, EXACTLY,
IT'S A MILITARY SHIRT.

13:39.633 --> 13:40.700
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

13:40.733 --> 13:42.300
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
IN A MESS HALL ?

13:42.333 --> 13:43.767
NO, I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A MESS HALL.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.067
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
WELL-DRESSED SOLDIERS EATING ?

13:46.100 --> 13:47.367
NO, I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN THE MILITARY,

13:47.400 --> 13:48.867
OKAY, WELL YOU SHOULD
EAT IN A MESS HALL.

13:48.900 --> 13:49.967
HAVE YOU EATEN
IN A MESS HALL ?

13:50.067 --> 13:51.233
YES, I HAVE.
REALLY ?

13:51.267 --> 13:52.667
YEAH, I'VE NEVER EATEN
IN AN OFFICERS' MESS HALL.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.100
BUT I CAN IMAGINE
THAT THEY'RE ALL THERE

13:55.133 --> 13:56.233
IN THEIR BRILLIANT
UNIFORMS.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.067
WHEN WERE YOU
IN THE MILITARY ?

13:58.067 --> 14:00.233
OH, YEARS AGO, BUT THAT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING.

14:00.267 --> 14:01.633
EXCUSE ME.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.867
I DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS,
BUT I KNOW YOU FROM SOMEWHERE

14:03.900 --> 14:05.900
AND I JUST
CAN'T PLACE IT.

14:05.933 --> 14:07.467
UH, BURT BONDY.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.067
I THINK I KNOW YOU
FROM THE 12:15 SPIN CLASS

14:09.067 --> 14:10.767
DOWN AT THE GYM.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.767
BURT.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.167
NO, I'VE NEVER TAKEN
A SPIN CLASS, SORRY.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.233
OH, I'M SORRY.

14:15.267 --> 14:16.267
OKAY.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.300
ARE YOU A FRIEND
OF BILL W.'s,

14:18.333 --> 14:20.500
IN THE PROGRAM, A.A. ?

14:20.533 --> 14:21.900
I THINK I KNOW YOU
FROM THERE, DON'T I ?

14:21.933 --> 14:25.633
NO, I WISH YOU DID, IT SOUNDS
LIKE A NICE PLACE TO HANG OUT.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.400
WHAT IS YOUR NAME ?

14:28.433 --> 14:29.500
LARRY DAVID.

14:29.533 --> 14:32.067
LARRY DAVID,
BURT BONDY.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.700
I KNOW YOU FROM
THE WAITING ROOM

14:33.733 --> 14:35.167
AT THE DENTIST'S OFFICE.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.233
DR. BLOURE, WE HAVE
E SAME DENTIST.

14:38.267 --> 14:42.700
OH, OKAY, OKAY,
YEAH, YEAH, RIGHT.

14:42.733 --> 14:44.533
I DON'T ACTUALLY
GO TO HIM ANYMORE.

14:44.567 --> 14:45.800
I STILL SEE HIM.

14:45.833 --> 14:47.267
IF I RUN INTO HIM
I'LL TELL HIM YOU SAID HELLO.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.633
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

14:49.667 --> 14:50.867
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO SAY HELLO ?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.867
IT'S KIND OF A TRITE THING
TO SAY TO SOMEBODY ANYWAY.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.433
SOMEONE SAYS HELLO,
YOU KNOW ?

14:54.467 --> 14:56.433
YEAH, I HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

14:56.467 --> 14:57.567
OH, VERY HIGH LEVEL.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.600
I GOT TO GET THERE,
THAT'S GOOD.

15:00.633 --> 15:01.600
OKAY, IT WAS
NICE MEETING YOU.

15:01.633 --> 15:02.733
OKAY, BURT,
TAKE CARE.

15:02.767 --> 15:04.067
TAKE CARE.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.133
BURT BONDY, WHAT WAS
THAT ALL ABOUT ?

15:07.167 --> 15:08.367
MY DENTIST INVITED ME
OUT TO DINNER,

15:08.400 --> 15:09.667
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
GOING THERE TONIGHT,

15:09.700 --> 15:12.233
AND I TOLD HIM
I WAS OUT OF TOWN.

15:12.267 --> 15:13.833
SIR ?

15:13.867 --> 15:15.233
LAST TWO.

15:15.267 --> 15:16.333
GREAT.

15:24.467 --> 15:27.400
IT'S KIND OF GOT A LITTLE
FRENCH QUALITY TO IT, NO ?

15:27.433 --> 15:29.867
YEAH, FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION,
MAYBE, BUT, NO.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.167
YEAH, THEY MIGHT
THINK WE HAVE, LIKE,

15:31.200 --> 15:32.933
SCIENTOLOGISTS FOR
WAIT PEOPLE OR SOMETHING.

15:32.967 --> 15:35.200
ARE YOU KIDDING ME,
YOU DON'T LIKE THIS,
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ?

15:35.233 --> 15:36.567
LARRY,
IT'S HORRIBLE.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.567
I LOOK AT THAT AND I SEE
WE'RE SERVING AIRLINE FOOD.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.667
I'M SORRY.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.067
CAN I SHOW MINE ?
ALRIGHT.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.533
SIMPLE, SIMPLE,
SIMPLE.

15:47.833 --> 15:50.467
THIS IS THE SHIRT,
CRISP, CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.100
OKAY, NOW, HERE'S WHERE
IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.567
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I PRESENT...

15:56.600 --> 15:57.767
THE VEST.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.900
A VEST, A VEST,
A NAVY VEST.

16:00.933 --> 16:02.733
SIMPLE, LOVELY.

16:02.767 --> 16:04.767
IT FEELS GOOD,
IT'S A VEST !

16:04.800 --> 16:05.867
UPSCALE.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.200
THAT'S VERY
CLASSY, RIGHT ?

16:07.233 --> 16:09.267
IT'S ALONG THE LINES
OF WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.300
APPLAUSE,
ACTUAL APPLAUSE, MIND YOU.

16:12.333 --> 16:13.433
THAT'S MY FAVORITE.

16:13.467 --> 16:15.067
SO, EVERYBODY
LIKE THAT ?

16:18.333 --> 16:19.967
I GOT YOU A PRESENT.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.633
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.600
THAT'S THE SHIRT
YOU WORE IN THE OTHER DAY.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.800
THAT'S GREAT, THANKS, LAR,
THAT'S REALLY SWEET OF YOU.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.367
OH, GEE,
LOOK AT THAT.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.433
A LITTLE RIP THERE.

16:35.467 --> 16:37.733
MY GOD, I'M SORRY.

16:37.767 --> 16:41.433
WELL, JUST TAKE IT BACK,
I'M SURE THEY'LL FIX IT FOR YOU.

16:44.367 --> 16:46.800
UH, COULDN'T YOU
TAKE IT BACK ?

16:46.833 --> 16:48.833
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE THIS STORE IS.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.500
UM...

16:52.067 --> 16:55.067
WELL, IT'S ON WILSHIRE
AND EIGHTH.

16:55.067 --> 16:56.600
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT BACK ?

16:56.633 --> 16:58.067
I JUST
GAVE YOU A GIFT.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.133
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME A GIFT,
YOU GAVE ME A DEFECTIVE SHIRT.

17:00.167 --> 17:02.067
IT'S GOT A HOLE IN IT,
THAT'S NOT A GIFT,
COME ON, LARRY.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.933
I DON'T OWN THIS SHIRT
ANYMORE, AS I SEE IT.

17:04.967 --> 17:07.067
I GAVE IT TO YOU,
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.200
IT'S NOT THE POINT.

17:08.233 --> 17:09.833
THE POINT IS,
IF YOU GIVE SOMEBODY A GIFT,

17:09.867 --> 17:11.567
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A GIFT,
NOT A PROBLEM.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.400
RIGHT, AND IF YOU GIVE
SOMEBODY A GIFT,

17:13.433 --> 17:14.667
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE AN INGRATE,

17:14.700 --> 17:15.867
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO SAY THANK YOU.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.533
ALRIGHT, HOW ABOUT
I GIVE YOU A GIFT,

17:17.567 --> 17:19.067
AND YOU HAVE
TO PICK IT UP IN SEATTLE.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.467
THAT'S A PROBLEM,
IT'S NOT A GIFT.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.500
IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME THING,
I'M GIVING YOU A GIFT.

17:22.533 --> 17:24.700
IT IS THE SAME THING,
LARRY.

17:24.733 --> 17:27.067
I APPRECIATE THE GESTURE,
THANK YOU, BUT...

17:27.067 --> 17:28.700
FINE, I'LL KEEP
THE SHIRT.

17:28.733 --> 17:29.767
GREAT.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.233
I CAN USE
AN EXTRA SHIRT.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.933
I MEAN, YOU TOOK A NICE THOUGHT,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S LIKE--

17:32.967 --> 17:34.333
WELL, YOU TOOK
A NICE THOUGHT, AND...

17:34.367 --> 17:36.500
I'M SORRY.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.800
OKAY, SO, WE'RE GOING WITH
THE BLUE SHIRT AND THE VEST ?

17:38.833 --> 17:40.900
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY,
I APPRECIATE THAT.

17:45.067 --> 17:46.767
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE TAUNTING TED.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.500
I'M NOT TAUNTING HIM.

17:48.533 --> 17:51.167
TAUNTING HIM...

17:51.200 --> 17:53.800
WHEN I BUY A NEW SHIRT, I LIKE
TO WEAR IT A LOT, SO WHAT ?

17:53.833 --> 17:55.333
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT HIM
WHEN I PUT IT ON.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.433
OKAY.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.633
HI.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.867
HI, JILL,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY !

17:59.900 --> 18:01.067
HI, LARRY.

18:01.067 --> 18:03.800
HI, TED,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

18:03.833 --> 18:04.967
THANKS FOR COMING,
CHERYL.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.667
I LIKE YOUR TIARA,
THAT'S NICE.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.300
FIFTH BIRTHDAY,
THIS IS VERY COOL.

18:08.333 --> 18:11.400
SO, UH, LET'S GET GOING,
WHERE'S MY LION COSTUME ?

18:11.433 --> 18:12.500
I'M READY.

18:12.533 --> 18:14.067
ACTUALLY
A CHANGE OF PLANS.

18:14.067 --> 18:15.133
YOU KNOW, I WANT
JEFF TO DO THE LION.

18:15.167 --> 18:16.167
YOU ARE THE LION.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.567
HEY, YES.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.133
YOU CAN
BE THE TIN MAN.

18:19.167 --> 18:20.133
DOROTHY.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.867
DOROTHY, PLEASE,
THANK YOU, THAT'S GREAT.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.400
TIN MAN, I DON'T WANT TO
DO THE TIN MAN.

18:24.433 --> 18:25.800
I HAVE NO CONNECTION
TO THE TIN MAN.

18:25.833 --> 18:27.067
I DON'T EVEN
LIKE THE TIN MAN.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.600
IT'S A KID'S PARTY,
YOU'LL BE FINE, LAR, REALLY.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.967
WHY'D YOU TAKE ME
OFF THE LION ?

18:32.067 --> 18:33.567
NO REASON.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.267
NO REASON, THERE'S
GOT TO BE A REASON.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.200
LARRY, IT'S A PARTY,
LET'S LIGHTEN UP, COME ON.

18:37.233 --> 18:38.267
YOU'LL BE FINE.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.167
IS IT 'CAUSE
OF THE SHIRT ?

18:40.200 --> 18:41.233
'CAUSE I WORE
THE SHIRT ?

18:41.267 --> 18:42.400
BECAUSE OF
THE SHIRT, RIGHT ?

18:42.433 --> 18:44.967
DON'T BE SILLY,
LARRY.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.100
HELP ME OUT HERE,
WILL YOU ?

18:46.133 --> 18:47.200
IT'S A PARTY.

18:47.233 --> 18:48.600
SO, HAVE A GOOD TIME.

18:48.633 --> 18:50.833
IF I CAN'T DO THE LION,
I DON'T WANT TO DO THE TIN MAN.

18:50.867 --> 18:52.500
I DON'T LIKE
THE TIN MAN.

18:52.533 --> 18:54.500
WELL, ALRIGHT, WE'LL FIND
SOMEONE ELSE, LAR.

18:54.533 --> 18:55.633
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
SWEETHEART,

18:55.667 --> 18:57.300
I'M GONNA GET THAT
OTHER GIFT, ALRIGHT ?

18:57.333 --> 18:58.833
FINE, YEAH, FIND SOMEBODY ELSE,
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

18:58.867 --> 19:01.500
WHAT AN A-S-S-H-O-L-E.

19:01.533 --> 19:03.167
HEY !
OKAY.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.600
WHAT, SHE'S FIVE YEARS OLD,
SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SPELL.

19:07.733 --> 19:10.267
I'M NOT GONNA
DO THE TIN MAN.

19:12.667 --> 19:13.933
VERY CLOSE.

19:13.967 --> 19:16.700
OH, THE TIN MAN
IS TOO GOOD.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.067
COME ON, LET ME HEAR
YOU DO THE VOICE, DO IT.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.067
I DON'T
DO THE VOICE.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

19:22.233 --> 19:23.400
I DON'T
DO IMPRESSIONS.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.133
WELL, WHY'D YOU SAY
YOU CAN DO THE LION ?

19:25.167 --> 19:26.633
LOOK AT ME, I'M THE LION,
I DON'T HAVE TO DO THE VOICE.

19:26.667 --> 19:27.933
YOU KNOW WHAT,
HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.600
DID YOU SEE US COME DOWN
THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD ?

19:29.633 --> 19:31.733
WE'RE HAVING FUN,
ALRIGHT ?

19:33.500 --> 19:34.500
LARRY !

19:34.533 --> 19:36.167
OH !

19:36.200 --> 19:38.900
OH, OH, LARRY,
I'M SO SORRY.

19:38.933 --> 19:41.267
OH, MY GOD !

19:41.300 --> 19:42.800
SHE BROKE
MY TEE !

19:42.833 --> 19:44.733
SHE DIDN'T
MEAN TO, LARRY.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.800
ALRIGHT,
LET'S GET SOME ICE.

19:46.833 --> 19:48.900
OH, OH, MY SHIRT !

19:52.233 --> 19:53.967
LARRY, WE'VE GOT
TO GET YOU TO A DENTIST.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.567
A DENTIST ?
IT'S SUNDAY.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.967
THEY'RE NOT OPEN
ON SUNDAY.

19:57.067 --> 20:00.033
WELL, WE'LL HAVE
TO CALL DR. BLOURE.

20:00.067 --> 20:01.533
DR. BLOURE.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.733
BURT BONDY.

20:13.767 --> 20:15.600
MAYBE I NEED A LITTLE
MORE NOVOCAINE.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.733
NO, IT'S GONNA KICK IN,
IT'S FINE, YEAH.

20:17.767 --> 20:20.867
STILL A LITTLE SOMETHING,
IT'S GETTING THERE ?

20:20.900 --> 20:22.100
A LITTLE BIT,
YEAH, IT'S GETTING THERE.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.767
I FEEL IT
GETTING NUMB.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.333
GOOD, LET ME
GIVE IT A MINUTE.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.233
ANYWAY, THANKS FOR
DOING THIS.

20:29.267 --> 20:33.100
I KNOW DENTISTS DON'T
LIKE TO COME IN ON SUNDAYS,

20:33.133 --> 20:34.400
IT'S LIKE A SACRED DAY.

20:34.433 --> 20:37.200
SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY,
YOU KNOW ?

20:37.233 --> 20:38.733
BUT I APPRECIATE IT.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.467
NOT A PROBLEM.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.533
HAPPY TO DO IT.

20:41.567 --> 20:44.800
SURE MISSED YOU
LAST SATURDAY.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.800
OH, YEAH, YEAH,
I'M SO SORRY.

20:46.833 --> 20:47.867
HOW DID IT TURN OUT,
WAS IT GOOD ?

20:47.900 --> 20:49.800
OH, IT WAS NICE,
BUT, YOU KNOW.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.033
OH, IT WOULD'VE
BEEN GREAT.

20:51.067 --> 20:52.900
I'M SO SORRY
I COULDN'T MAKE IT.

20:52.933 --> 20:54.067
DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD TRIP ?

20:54.100 --> 20:56.100
YEAH, WE WENT UP
TO SONOMA.

20:56.133 --> 20:58.700
MY COUSIN'S GOT
A PEAR FARM UP THERE.

20:58.733 --> 20:59.767
A PEAR FARM ?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.800
YEAH, LIKE AN ORCHARD,
RIGHT ?

21:01.833 --> 21:03.367
BARTLETT PEARS.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.300
BARTLETT, THOSE ARE--
I LIKE PEARS.

21:06.333 --> 21:09.967
THEY'RE DELICIOUS,
BUT ALL WEEKEND LONG,
PEAR AFTER PEAR.

21:10.067 --> 21:11.200
PEARS IN EVERYTHING,
SURE, SURE.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.333
BOY, OH, BOY, YOU KNOW,
I WAS GETTING THE RUNS

21:13.367 --> 21:14.567
UP THERE
AFTER AWHILE.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.300
WELL, FRUIT WILL
DO THAT.

21:16.333 --> 21:19.133
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE BEEN
IN YOUR HOUSE ON SATURDAY NIGHT

21:19.167 --> 21:20.900
THAN EATING PEARS,
BELIEVE ME.

21:20.933 --> 21:22.500
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S RELATIVES,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ?

21:22.533 --> 21:23.867
RIGHT, RIGHT.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.767
AND WE VISITED
THE CABIN WHERE,

21:26.800 --> 21:29.733
UH, BOB BARTLETT,
WHO THE PEAR'S NAMED AFTER,

21:29.767 --> 21:31.100
A GUY NAMED
BOB BARTLETT.

21:31.133 --> 21:32.167
I DIDN'T REALIZE THE PEAR
WAS NAMED AFTER A GUY.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.833
IN THE EARLY PART
OF THE 20th CENTURY.

21:33.867 --> 21:35.067
HERE IN THE,
HERE...

21:35.067 --> 21:37.333
YEAH, RIGHT HERE
UP IN SONOMA, BOB BARTLETT.

21:39.700 --> 21:42.833
AND WE WENT TO HIS,
SAW HIS CABIN AND EVERYTHING.

21:42.867 --> 21:45.333
AND HE'S STILL GOT
RELATIVES THERE, ACTUALLY.

21:45.367 --> 21:46.867
YEAH, AND THEY'RE STILL
MAKING A LIVING

21:46.900 --> 21:50.467
OFF OF THESE PEARS
FOR OVER 100 YEARS NOW.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.900
EVERYBODY KNOWS
A BARTLETTEAR, RIGHT ?

21:51.933 --> 21:55.500
THE BARTLETTS ARE--
THEY RUN THE TOWN THERE, YEAH.

21:55.533 --> 21:57.700
THAT'S THAT
GREEN PEAR, RIGHT ?

21:57.733 --> 22:00.067
NO, IT'S A BROWN PEAR.

22:00.067 --> 22:03.267
THEY START OFF GREEN,
THEN THEY TURN BROWN.

22:03.300 --> 22:06.700
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE BOSK
THAT WAS THE BROWN.

22:06.733 --> 22:09.067
NO, NO.

22:09.067 --> 22:10.633
IT'S THE BARTLETT.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.200
BURT BONDY
WAS IN THIS WEEK.

22:16.833 --> 22:19.467
BURT BONDY ?

22:19.500 --> 22:20.700
DO I KNOW HIM ?
I DON'T KNOW.

22:20.733 --> 22:22.333
HE SEEMS
TO THINK YOU DO.

22:22.367 --> 22:24.933
REALLY ?
MM-HMM.

22:24.967 --> 22:27.067
I DON'T THINK SO.
BURT BONDY.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.733
I THINK WE'RE READY.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.567
Did she hurt you ?

22:46.600 --> 22:48.400
Oh, she tried to,
didn't she ?

22:48.433 --> 22:49.467
C'mon...

22:49.500 --> 22:50.833
( door slamming )

22:50.867 --> 22:51.867
HONEY ?

22:51.900 --> 22:53.300
YEAH.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.800
HOW DID IT GO ?

22:58.600 --> 23:00.067
LOOK AT THAT.

23:00.067 --> 23:03.300
THESE ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE TEMPORARIES, OKAY ?

23:03.333 --> 23:04.633
SEE THE SIZE
OF THESE THINGS ?

23:04.667 --> 23:06.833
HE DID IT ON PURPOSE,
BLOURE.

23:06.867 --> 23:09.367
BECAUSE BONDY OBVIOUSLY
TOLD HIM THAT HE RAN INTO ME

23:09.400 --> 23:13.500
AND I WASN'T OUT OF TOWN
AND HE DID THIS TO GET EVEN.

23:13.533 --> 23:15.067
WELL, THEY'RE ONLY
TEMPORARIES.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.533
YEAH, I KNOW THEY'RE
ONLY TEMPORARIES,

23:16.567 --> 23:19.100
BUT TEMPORARIES AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO LOOK LIKE CHICKLETS, OKAY ?

23:19.133 --> 23:20.500
LOOK AT THIS, LOOK AT
THE SIZE OF THESE THINGS.

23:20.533 --> 23:21.800
YEAH, THAT'S
ABOUT RIGHT.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.733
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:23.767 --> 23:25.867
I DON'T THINK YOU REALLY KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT TEMPORARIES.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.300
HOW DO YOU KNOW ?

23:27.333 --> 23:29.600
I CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU KNOW
VERY LITTLE ABOUT TEMPORARIES.

23:29.633 --> 23:31.700
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION

23:31.733 --> 23:32.733
WITH YOU
ABOUT TEMPORARIES.

23:32.767 --> 23:33.900
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE.

23:33.933 --> 23:35.400
OH, LIKE I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT TEMPORARIES.

23:35.433 --> 23:36.867
DID YOU SEE
WHAT'S ON ?

23:36.900 --> 23:40.067
You're just
as scared as I am.

23:40.067 --> 23:42.067
OH, WONDERFUL.

23:42.067 --> 23:45.067
YOU KNOW, IF YOU JUST
WOULD'VE DONE THE TIN MAN,

23:45.067 --> 23:46.300
NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.233
MAYBE JILL DID IT
ON PURPOSE, TOO.

23:48.267 --> 23:49.533
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.

23:49.567 --> 23:52.767
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE CALLED TED AN ASSHOLE.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.933
THE SHIRT,
LOOK AT THIS.

23:55.967 --> 23:58.733
FORTUNATELY I HAVE
TWO MORE UPSTAIRS.

23:58.767 --> 24:02.100
THE ONE I BOUGHT FOR TED,
AND I BOUGHT AN EXTRA ONE, SEE ?

24:03.567 --> 24:05.367
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT FUNNY, CHERYL.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.867
I GOT HIT IN THE MOUTH
WITH A BASEBALL BAT.

24:06.900 --> 24:09.800
I'M SORRY AND I HONESTLY
AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

24:09.833 --> 24:11.200
( doorbell )
WHO THE HELL
IS THAT ?

24:11.233 --> 24:12.967
OH, THAT'S BARBARA
WITH THE FRAME.

24:14.633 --> 24:19.267
HEY, I'M SO SORRY,
CAN I COME IN ?

24:19.300 --> 24:21.133
YEAH.

24:21.167 --> 24:22.333
I AM SO SORRY.

24:22.367 --> 24:24.433
THAT'S AN AWFUL THING
TO HAPPEN.

24:24.467 --> 24:25.500
HOW YOU DOING ?

24:25.533 --> 24:26.733
GREAT.

24:26.767 --> 24:28.867
LET ME SEE.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.067
WOW, THEY'RE BIG,
AREN'T THEY ?

24:30.100 --> 24:31.867
YEAH, THEY'RE VERY BIG.

24:31.900 --> 24:32.933
THEY HURT ?

24:32.967 --> 24:35.233
NO.

24:35.267 --> 24:36.500
I'M SO SORRY.

24:36.533 --> 24:37.733
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

24:37.767 --> 24:38.900
CAN I JUST GIVE YOU
A LITTLE WORD OF ADVICE ?

24:38.933 --> 24:40.200
YES, ANYTHING,
ABSOLUTELY.

24:40.233 --> 24:43.800
FORGET THE PIÑATA
PARTIES, OKAY ?

24:43.833 --> 24:45.767
IT'S A DANGEROUS GAME,
YOU COULD SEE WHAT COULD HAPPEN,

24:45.800 --> 24:47.800
YOU GOT KIDS SWINGING
BASEBALL BATS AROUND,

24:47.833 --> 24:49.533
AND EVEN IF
THE CANDY COMES DOWN,

24:49.567 --> 24:52.067
THEN YOU'VE GOT THESE VULTURES
COMING AND GETTING CANDY,

24:52.100 --> 24:53.367
STUFFING IT
IN THEIR POCKET,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.200
KILLING EACH OTHER
TO GET TO THE CANDY.

24:55.233 --> 24:57.233
IT'S A CRAZY, CRAZY GAME,
IT'S DANGEROUS.

24:57.267 --> 24:58.667
I DON'T KNOW HOW
THE SPANIARDS DO IT.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.467
HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN
DOING THIS PIÑATA ?

25:00.500 --> 25:04.167
NOT ONE SPANISH PERSON HAS
FIGURED OUT THAT THE PIÑATA

25:04.200 --> 25:06.300
IS A SICK
FUCKING GAME ?

25:06.333 --> 25:09.667
I HOPE YOU KNOW JILL
DID NOT DO THAT ON PURPOSE.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.300
REALLY, SHE FEELS
TERRIBLE ABOUT IT.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.667
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED ME
AN ASSHOLE IN FRONT OF HER,

25:14.700 --> 25:16.100
BUT...

25:16.133 --> 25:17.433
SHE'S A PRETTY
GOOD SPELLER.

25:17.467 --> 25:18.533
YEAH.

25:18.567 --> 25:20.233
FIVE YEARS OLD,
SHE CAN SPELL ASSHOLE.

25:20.267 --> 25:21.833
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

25:21.867 --> 25:23.500
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
ON THE WAY UP HERE,

25:23.533 --> 25:26.133
I WAS THINKING,
I WOULD LIKE THAT SHIRT.

25:26.167 --> 25:27.767
I'LL TAKE IT
AND I'LL EXCHANGE IT.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.367
IT WAS A GREAT GIFT.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.300
YOU CAN'T EXCHANGE ANYMORE,
THEY'RE OUT.

25:31.333 --> 25:32.433
THERE'S NO MORE LEFT.

25:32.467 --> 25:33.600
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.800
I CAN TAKE IT TO A SHIRT GUY,
HE'LL FIX IT.

25:36.833 --> 25:38.200
THIS ONE'S RUINED,
AS YOU CAN SEE.

25:38.233 --> 25:43.500
AND I WAS KIND OF PLANNING
ON KEEPING THE OTHER ONE.

25:43.533 --> 25:45.333
THE ONE
YOU GAVE ME ?

25:45.367 --> 25:47.567
THE ONE YOU GAVE
BACK TO ME.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.067
I ONLY GAVE IT
BACK TO YOU

25:49.067 --> 25:51.367
BECAUSE YOU WERE BEING RUDE
ABOUT ME HAVING TO EXCHANGE IT.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.833
WELL, YOU STILL,
NEVERTHELESS,

25:52.867 --> 25:55.533
DIDN'T ACCEPT MY GRACIOUS GIFT,
AND YOU GAVE IT BACK TO ME,

25:55.567 --> 25:56.900
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS ?

25:56.933 --> 25:59.067
EVERY TIME WE GET TOGETHER
WE PUSH AND PULL LIKE THIS.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.567
YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE SHIRT
IN THE FIRST PLACE, YOU--

26:00.600 --> 26:02.633
LARRY, LARRY !

26:02.667 --> 26:05.067
I'M TRYING TO WATCH
"THE WIZARD OF OZ".

26:05.100 --> 26:07.267
YOU JUST SAID YOU HAVE
TWO SHIRTS UPSTAIRS.

26:07.300 --> 26:10.267
GO UPSTAIRS,
GIVE TED HIS SHIRT,

26:10.300 --> 26:12.267
AND YOU'LL HAVE ONE
FOR YOURSELF.

26:12.300 --> 26:13.400
HI, TED.

26:16.833 --> 26:18.733
YOU GOT
TWO SHIRTS ?

26:23.867 --> 26:25.733
WELL, I BOUGHT
AN EXTRA ONE.

26:34.633 --> 26:40.867
* SOMEWHERE
OVER THE RAINBOW *

26:41.967 --> 26:43.067
( Larry )
HEY.

26:45.367 --> 26:46.700
JUST PUT IT DOWN.

26:46.733 --> 26:56.700
* THERE'S A LAND THAT I HEARD OF
ONCE IN A LULLABY *

26:56.733 --> 27:00.233
* SOMEWHERE
OVER THE RAINBOW *

27:00.267 --> 27:03.267
( doorbell )
OH, THAT'S BARBARA.

27:05.267 --> 27:08.267
SO, THE RESTAURANT,

27:08.300 --> 27:11.133
YEAH, I'M GOING IN
FOR THE SAME AMOUNT AS YOU.

27:11.167 --> 27:12.967
YEAH ?

27:13.067 --> 27:14.067
YEAH, YOU GOT
A PROBLEM ?

27:14.100 --> 27:15.467
NO.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.500
IS THAT ALRIGHT ?

27:16.533 --> 27:17.667
YEAH.
YEAH ?

27:17.700 --> 27:19.433
OKAY.

27:19.467 --> 27:21.067
ALRIGHT,
THAT LOOKS GREAT.

27:21.067 --> 27:22.567
YEAH, I THOUGHT IT
CAME OUT REALLY WELL.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.767
IT REALLY DID.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.133
YEAH, I'M SORRY IT TOOK,
YOU KNOW, SUCH A LONG TIME.

27:26.167 --> 27:27.900
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
WITH CHET AND, YOU UNDERSTAND.

27:27.933 --> 27:29.900
I KNOW, I KNOW.

27:29.933 --> 27:33.200
YEAH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

27:33.233 --> 27:34.667
OH, WE'RE WATCHING
"THE WIZARD OF OZ".

27:34.700 --> 27:36.900
YOU WANT
TO COME BACK ?

27:36.933 --> 27:38.567
COME ON.

27:38.600 --> 27:44.267
* OH, WHY CAN'T I

27:44.300 --> 27:46.367
COME ON IN,
HAVE A SEAT.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.100
BARBARA,

27:48.133 --> 27:49.133
HI.

27:49.167 --> 27:52.067
OH, MY GOD, OH.

27:52.067 --> 27:54.233
THIS WAS OUR MOVIE.

27:54.267 --> 27:55.667
CHET LOVED
THIS SONG.

27:55.700 --> 28:02.333
* IF HAPPY LITTLE BLUEBIRDS FLY
BEYOND THE RAINBOW *

28:02.367 --> 28:04.067
CHET'S SHIRT.

28:05.067 --> 28:09.300
( sobbing )

28:29.100 --> 28:31.167
NO, NO !

28:47.500 --> 28:49.500
