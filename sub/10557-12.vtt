00:40.781 --> 00:44.710
Murdoch Mysteries S02E12

01:22.381 --> 01:24.422
Who's there?!

01:25.061 --> 01:28.062
Answer me,
or I'm setting the dogs on you!

01:29.340 --> 01:31.902
God help you!
Go!

01:58.021 --> 02:00.021
Look at the moon.
It's so big.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.621
Yes, it's beautiful.

02:01.821 --> 02:03.861
Do you think there's moon men
living up there?

02:04.060 --> 02:05.381
Oh, I don't think so, Alwyn.

02:05.580 --> 02:07.021
The moon has no atmosphere.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.741
And life needs free oxygen
to survive.

02:09.940 --> 02:11.181
William?

02:12.741 --> 02:14.341
How surprising to see you here.

02:14.541 --> 02:15.820
And Mrs. Jones.

02:16.020 --> 02:16.860
Dr. Ogden.

02:17.060 --> 02:18.461
Out gazing at the moon,
were you?

02:18.661 --> 02:20.740
Mr. Murdoch says
life can't exist up there

02:20.941 --> 02:22.741
'cause there's no oxygen.

02:22.941 --> 02:24.900
Well, actually, they've
just discovered a bacterium

02:25.101 --> 02:27.461
that thrives in
the complete absence of oxygen.

02:27.661 --> 02:29.740
Why, then, I would bet
that there are moon men

02:29.941 --> 02:32.620
up there right now
eating all that green cheese.

02:36.420 --> 02:38.340
I'm sorry.
My manners.

02:38.541 --> 02:40.621
I'd like you to meet
Reginald Poundsett.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.540
- This is William --
- Detective William Murdoch.

02:43.740 --> 02:44.381
A pleasure.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.140
- And Mrs. Enid Jones.
- Enid Jones.

02:47.340 --> 02:48.380
Mrs. Jones.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.180
And I'm Alwyn.

02:50.380 --> 02:51.861
Young man.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.940
Well, we should be going.
We don't want to be late.

02:56.139 --> 02:58.741
Yes.
Have a wonderful evening.

03:02.701 --> 03:05.060
So there could be moon men?

03:05.260 --> 03:05.900
Well...

03:06.100 --> 03:08.779
Yes, Alwyn.
Of course there could.

03:09.540 --> 03:11.260
Of course there could be.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.100
He's asleep.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.060
Dreaming of moon men, no doubt.

03:29.940 --> 03:33.700
It was strange bumping into
Dr. Ogden like that, wasn't it?

03:34.420 --> 03:35.540
Yes.

03:39.460 --> 03:42.700
Mr. Poundsett seems like
a pleasant fellow.

03:44.019 --> 03:46.939
So, is it a romance
between them, then?

03:47.140 --> 03:48.140
I wouldn't know.

03:48.340 --> 03:50.539
We don't discuss such things.

03:52.860 --> 03:54.739
Would it bother you if it was?

03:55.979 --> 03:59.060
I-I don't know.

03:59.259 --> 04:00.979
Why would you ask me
such a thing?

04:01.180 --> 04:04.298
It's obvious when you see her, William.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.740
Obvious to me, if not to you.

04:07.338 --> 04:09.939
Enid, I can assure you
that Dr. Ogden and I

04:10.139 --> 04:12.939
are professional colleagues,
and that is all.

04:13.139 --> 04:14.740
Are you sure
you're not just saying that

04:14.940 --> 04:16.099
to spare my feelings?

04:19.019 --> 04:22.219
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
Uh, ma'am.

04:23.019 --> 04:24.500
You're needed, sir.

04:33.220 --> 04:35.139
- Evening, sir.
- What have we?

04:35.339 --> 04:37.459
The victim was found
just after 9:30.

04:37.659 --> 04:38.660
Have you determined identity?

04:38.859 --> 04:40.658
We found this on his person.
Merrill Hardy.

04:40.859 --> 04:43.538
He was vice president
at Dominion Bank.

04:44.179 --> 04:45.059
What are those?

04:45.259 --> 04:47.459
Those, sir, we believe,
are his dogs.

04:47.659 --> 04:50.538
And they --
Well, they've been mauled.

04:50.739 --> 04:53.738
Strange place for a banker
to be walking his dogs.

04:53.939 --> 04:54.939
I thought so, too.

04:59.739 --> 05:01.979
Hello again, Doctor.
What have we?

05:02.178 --> 05:03.379
Quite a mess.

05:03.578 --> 05:05.819
The entire throat area
is torn open.

05:06.019 --> 05:07.618
Torn?

05:07.818 --> 05:09.379
It appears to be
the result of a bite,

05:09.579 --> 05:12.219
but I have no idea what could cause
such a savage wound.

05:12.419 --> 05:14.659
Perhaps his dogs turned on him?

05:15.258 --> 05:16.539
Except they're both dead.

05:16.738 --> 05:19.619
And this is much larger
than anything a dog could do.

05:19.818 --> 05:21.899
It could be a bear, I suppose.

05:22.099 --> 05:24.458
Bears use their claws.

05:25.019 --> 05:26.939
A wolf, perhaps?

05:27.138 --> 05:27.939
Possibly.

05:28.139 --> 05:29.938
But a wolf running loose
in a modern city?

05:30.139 --> 05:32.739
It's like some terrible
fairy tale.

05:32.939 --> 05:33.938
Yes.

05:34.137 --> 05:36.139
Fairy tales are make-believe.

05:37.737 --> 05:41.539
And what we have here
is very, very real.

05:49.658 --> 05:52.098
Yes.
Shocking is the word.

05:52.298 --> 05:53.538
No. No. Of course.
You're right, sir.

05:53.738 --> 05:55.379
There are no words.

05:55.579 --> 05:57.818
I'll see to it personally.
Bye.

05:58.339 --> 05:59.938
- The chief constable?
- The bleeding mayor.

06:00.139 --> 06:02.578
Seems him and Merrill Hardy
were tennis partners.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.538
Naturally, he wants this beast
captured and killed.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.058
- Of course.
- So I've called in a tracker.

06:06.258 --> 06:07.898
We've got one, you know.
Works at the stables.

06:08.459 --> 06:10.337
Oh.
That's prudent, I suppose.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.019
But I'm not entirely convinced
we're looking for a wolf.

06:13.218 --> 06:13.897
Why not?

06:14.097 --> 06:16.138
Well, there are a number
of troubling questions.

06:16.338 --> 06:17.338
Such as?

06:17.538 --> 06:20.138
When was the last time
you heard of a wolf attack?

06:20.338 --> 06:22.538
I don't know,
but I know they happen.

06:22.739 --> 06:24.578
They're what make
the Brothers Grimm so bloody grim.

06:24.777 --> 06:27.098
Yes, but wouldn't the wolf
have fed on the carcass?

06:27.937 --> 06:29.058
Perhaps it was scared off.

06:30.018 --> 06:31.418
There's also this.

06:32.538 --> 06:33.817
Mr. Hardy's gun.

06:34.018 --> 06:37.137
He had it out and ready
when he was killed.

06:37.338 --> 06:38.137
Still loaded.

06:38.338 --> 06:40.338
As if he never had a chance
to get a shot off.

06:40.538 --> 06:43.537
I admit, that is curious.

06:44.138 --> 06:47.017
Excuse me, Inspector.
Uh, you asked for a tracker?

06:47.218 --> 06:48.258
Ah. James, isn't it?
Come in.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.378
Crabtree!

06:49.938 --> 06:51.738
Jimmy, actually.
Jimmy McLeod.

06:51.938 --> 06:53.738
Detective William Murdoch.
Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

06:53.938 --> 06:55.617
- The same.
- Sir?

06:55.818 --> 06:57.537
Take Jimmy here
back to the murder scene.

06:57.738 --> 06:59.217
See if he can pick up
the trail of this wolf.

06:59.418 --> 07:00.617
Yes, sir.

07:03.418 --> 07:06.338
So now the investigation
is officially under way,

07:06.538 --> 07:08.817
how are we gonna answer
these lingering questions?

07:09.018 --> 07:12.299
By finding out what a banker was doing
in a burned-out foundry

07:12.498 --> 07:15.178
with a loaded gun
and two guard dogs.

07:18.298 --> 07:21.137
I don't know
what Merrill was doing there.

07:21.738 --> 07:23.297
He just said, "I'm...

07:23.497 --> 07:26.537
I'm taking the dogs,
and I'll be back in an hour."

07:27.657 --> 07:29.337
And then he kissed me.

07:31.738 --> 07:34.817
If I had known it was
going to be the last time...

07:36.257 --> 07:39.937
Mrs. Hardy, this must be
terribly difficult for you.

07:40.937 --> 07:44.336
Your husband was carrying
a pistol.

07:45.618 --> 07:47.537
A pistol?

07:48.777 --> 07:50.297
What on earth for?
What...

07:50.497 --> 07:52.698
Perhaps he was having trouble
with someone?

07:53.616 --> 07:55.058
Oh, no, no, no.

07:55.817 --> 07:58.016
Merrill got along
with everybody.

07:58.216 --> 08:01.297
Yet he felt the need to keep
two large guard dogs as well.

08:01.497 --> 08:04.137
We only got those last month.

08:04.856 --> 08:08.096
Merrill said there had been some lurkers
in the neighborhood.

08:09.537 --> 08:11.496
But now I'm wondering
if it was something else.

08:12.697 --> 08:14.176
What do you mean?

08:14.736 --> 08:16.737
One night I woke,
and he was standing there,

08:16.936 --> 08:21.777
staring out the window,
as if he was looking for someone...

08:21.977 --> 08:23.817
or something.

08:26.017 --> 08:28.538
Mrs. Hardy,
did your husband keep a diary

08:28.737 --> 08:31.656
or some place
he collected his thoughts?

08:31.858 --> 08:33.897
He had a daybook in his desk.

08:34.936 --> 08:36.577
Concrete.

08:36.777 --> 08:39.337
Not many tracks to be found
in concrete.

08:39.537 --> 08:40.496
No.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.655
So, how does one track
when there are no tracks?

08:43.856 --> 08:48.055
Do you look for overturned stones,
broken twigs, and such?

08:48.256 --> 08:49.897
Well, there's always tracks.

08:50.097 --> 08:53.136
You don't have to find every one.
Just the next one.

08:53.336 --> 08:55.537
Where did you learn to track?

08:55.737 --> 08:56.656
My grandfather.

08:56.856 --> 08:59.137
I lived with him
until I was 10.

08:59.337 --> 09:01.057
Where did you go then?

09:01.255 --> 09:05.056
I got taken away.
Sent to residential school.

09:08.216 --> 09:09.697
What is it?

09:10.456 --> 09:12.297
See for yourself.

09:12.496 --> 09:15.176
These are a man's footprints.
We're looking for a wolf.

09:15.376 --> 09:18.897
But look how he was standing.
Facing the wall.

09:20.376 --> 09:22.417
Or...

09:22.616 --> 09:24.736
peering around the wall.

09:25.936 --> 09:28.496
He may have watched the attack.

09:28.696 --> 09:31.376
In fact,
this man could be involved.

09:31.576 --> 09:32.616
Maybe.

09:32.816 --> 09:33.936
Maybe not.

09:34.135 --> 09:35.737
What makes you say that?

09:36.896 --> 09:39.576
Because now the tracks
go the other way.

09:40.296 --> 09:42.176
And he was running.

09:43.136 --> 09:45.497
Well, yes. He was fleeing
the scene of the crime.

09:46.137 --> 09:48.295
Or racing for his life.

10:05.696 --> 10:09.135
Mrs. Hardy,
do you know a Jake S.?

10:09.935 --> 10:11.855
Only one.
Jacob Summers.

10:12.056 --> 10:15.416
He's an architect,
an associate of Merrill's.

10:18.415 --> 10:19.815
Pull!

10:22.496 --> 10:23.575
Damn!

10:23.775 --> 10:25.015
Jacob Summers.

10:26.696 --> 10:27.255
Yes?

10:27.455 --> 10:30.136
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

10:31.416 --> 10:33.135
Well, we'll talk tomorrow.

10:34.095 --> 10:35.456
Detective.

10:36.215 --> 10:37.455
How may I help you?

10:37.655 --> 10:40.456
I understand
you knew Merrill Hardy?

10:40.654 --> 10:42.616
Yes, I did.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.576
Terrible what happened.

10:44.775 --> 10:46.936
Did you send him this telegram?

10:49.535 --> 10:52.015
Jamison Foundry.
That's where Merrill was killed.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.295
Are you suggesting
I had something to do with it?

10:53.496 --> 10:55.295
I repeat, sir --
Did you send him this telegram?

10:55.495 --> 10:56.855
No, I didn't.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.935
Curious. He apparently only knew
one Jake S. -- you.

11:00.135 --> 11:02.855
I sign all my correspondence
"J. Summers."

11:03.056 --> 11:03.935
Everyone knows that.

11:04.135 --> 11:06.175
- Including Merrill Hardy?
- Well, I should think so.

11:06.376 --> 11:07.775
We did business
on several occasions.

11:07.974 --> 11:09.335
I'll need to know
your whereabouts

11:09.535 --> 11:10.855
for yesterday afternoon
and evening.

11:11.055 --> 11:12.335
Detective, I am not this Jake S.

11:12.535 --> 11:15.415
Again, sir.
Your whereabouts.

11:15.615 --> 11:17.095
I was at the office until 6:00,

11:17.294 --> 11:18.494
and then I went
to the Waverly Men's Club,

11:18.694 --> 11:19.935
where I spent the remainder
of the evening.

11:20.135 --> 11:21.574
Pull!

11:26.695 --> 11:29.055
Where the devil is he headed?

11:31.095 --> 11:32.134
Shh.

11:35.975 --> 11:38.814
Stay behind me.
This could be dangerous.

11:44.734 --> 11:46.215
Doesn't seem
all that dangerous to me.

11:50.095 --> 11:51.454
- Oh!
- Rise and shine.

11:56.695 --> 11:57.934
This telegram
Merrill Hardy received

11:58.134 --> 12:00.135
was sent while Mr. Summers
was at his club.

12:00.334 --> 12:01.135
And we're sure of that?

12:01.335 --> 12:02.735
Several people
have placed him there.

12:02.934 --> 12:04.494
He could have got someone
to send it for him.

12:04.695 --> 12:07.334
Perhaps. But there is
the issue of his signature.

12:07.534 --> 12:09.415
Perhaps he slipped up
and signed it differently.

12:09.615 --> 12:11.814
Or perhaps
he's telling the truth,

12:12.014 --> 12:13.934
and it's the killer
who has slipped up.

12:14.135 --> 12:15.014
So Hardy gets the telegram

12:15.215 --> 12:17.334
and realizes he's being lured
to this location.

12:17.534 --> 12:18.934
So why not go to the police?

12:19.135 --> 12:20.534
I think we should assume
that Mr. Hardy

12:20.734 --> 12:21.894
was involved
in something criminal.

12:22.094 --> 12:23.934
So, thinking he has
the advantage,

12:24.135 --> 12:25.254
he prepares for a confrontation.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.214
Only two dogs and a gun
aren't enough to stop the killer.

12:29.294 --> 12:31.734
Excuse me, sir.
We've had a spot of success.

12:31.934 --> 12:33.455
You've tracked down a wolf?

12:35.053 --> 12:36.335
Not a wolf.

12:36.534 --> 12:39.535
I was a mite dry,
and was a fella I know

12:39.734 --> 12:42.614
keeps a stash
'round back of the boiler,

12:42.814 --> 12:46.534
on account of his missus gets into it
if it's in the house.

12:46.735 --> 12:48.733
So you thought
you'd help yourself?

12:48.933 --> 12:50.254
I was just borrowing.

12:50.454 --> 12:51.973
I'm not a thief.

12:52.173 --> 12:53.734
Of course not.

12:53.934 --> 12:54.974
So, what happened?

12:56.334 --> 12:57.813
I heard 'em.

12:58.014 --> 13:01.253
Dogs growling as if they were fighting
for their lives.

13:02.534 --> 13:04.014
So you went to see
what was happening.

13:04.214 --> 13:05.093
Aye.

13:05.293 --> 13:07.574
Saw the dogs lying there.

13:08.534 --> 13:09.814
Torn to pieces!

13:11.174 --> 13:12.734
And then I saw it.

13:12.934 --> 13:14.095
Saw what?

13:15.493 --> 13:19.052
- A flash of fur.
- A wolf, perhaps?

13:19.254 --> 13:21.574
Aye.
That's what it was, all right.

13:21.774 --> 13:22.414
A wolf.

13:22.614 --> 13:24.933
Mm. And did you see
what happened to the victim?

13:25.133 --> 13:26.734
No.

13:26.934 --> 13:28.333
But I heard him scream.

13:29.214 --> 13:30.654
And then I ran.
And I hid.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.773
Like a coward.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.413
And then I saw it walk past.

13:35.614 --> 13:36.733
The wolf?

13:36.933 --> 13:38.853
It weren't no wolf.

13:39.053 --> 13:40.174
It was a man.

13:40.374 --> 13:42.333
You said you saw a wolf.
Now, which was it?

13:42.534 --> 13:43.893
You ain't listening.

13:44.453 --> 13:46.734
It was a wolf I saw
in that building,

13:46.933 --> 13:48.853
but it was a man that came out!

13:52.694 --> 13:54.334
I think we can all agree

13:54.534 --> 13:57.093
that the witness was describing
a werewolf.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.614
Bloody hell, Crabtree.
It wasn't a werewolf.

13:59.813 --> 14:01.253
It was a full moon
last night, sir.

14:01.453 --> 14:02.974
There was a man,
and there was a wolf.

14:03.174 --> 14:05.453
And the man was using his wolf
as a weapon.

14:05.653 --> 14:07.333
But, sir, the witness
only saw the one leave.

14:07.534 --> 14:08.892
He was three sheets to the wind
in a gale.

14:09.092 --> 14:10.574
Who knows what he saw?

14:11.134 --> 14:13.813
Sir, it's probably not my place
to say this.

14:14.013 --> 14:15.733
Speak your mind, Jimmy.

14:15.934 --> 14:18.012
Well, sir, uh,
it's my understanding

14:18.213 --> 14:21.533
that the witness didn't say
he saw a wolf exactly.

14:21.733 --> 14:22.893
Just a flash.

14:23.093 --> 14:24.253
It was the sounds
that he heard --

14:24.453 --> 14:25.973
the snarling and the growling --

14:26.174 --> 14:27.612
that made him think
it was a wolf.

14:27.813 --> 14:29.614
So what do you think it was?

14:29.813 --> 14:31.492
A windigo, sir.

14:32.172 --> 14:32.814
A windigo?

14:33.013 --> 14:34.533
It's the name that we give
to an evil spirit

14:34.734 --> 14:36.133
that lives up
in the northern woods.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.333
It takes possession
of the people

14:37.533 --> 14:39.654
and makes them hunger
for human flesh.

14:39.853 --> 14:41.892
Cannibals.
Now, that's a chilling thought.

14:42.093 --> 14:44.133
You know, I've heard that
in the islands near Borneo --

14:44.334 --> 14:45.852
- Crabtree!
- Actually, sir,

14:46.053 --> 14:47.333
there may be something
to both of these arguments.

14:47.533 --> 14:49.132
Oh, not you too, Murdoch.

14:49.332 --> 14:51.332
I'm not suggesting
anything supernatural,

14:51.533 --> 14:54.893
but there are people who believe
themselves to be animals.

14:55.092 --> 14:57.053
So you're saying
this is some kind of lunatic

14:57.253 --> 14:58.332
with a taste for human blood?

14:58.532 --> 15:00.693
It would explain
the feral nature of the attacks.

15:00.893 --> 15:03.292
How does a man tear out
another man's throat, then?

15:03.493 --> 15:05.332
And what kind of lunatic
has the presence of mind

15:05.532 --> 15:07.812
to send his victim a telegram
in advance?

15:08.012 --> 15:09.493
That's what I intend
to find out.

15:09.693 --> 15:11.053
Oh, fine.
You go looking for your wolf man.

15:11.253 --> 15:13.053
And you two get back
to the alley.

15:13.253 --> 15:14.773
We're looking for a man
and a wolf.

15:14.972 --> 15:16.652
See if you can find out
where they went.

15:18.172 --> 15:19.132
Well, move it!

15:20.732 --> 15:22.572
So, have you
an opinion, Dr. Roberts?

15:22.773 --> 15:26.133
The condition you're describing
is lycanthropy.

15:26.332 --> 15:28.452
The term is applied
to individuals

15:28.652 --> 15:30.332
who, for psychological reasons,

15:30.532 --> 15:33.693
believe themselves to be
an animal, most often a wolf.

15:33.893 --> 15:36.492
Hence, lycanthropy's
traditional association

15:36.693 --> 15:38.053
with the werewolf myth.

15:38.252 --> 15:40.772
The victim was discovered
with his throat ripped out.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.532
A witness claims to have heard
snarling and growling

15:43.732 --> 15:44.612
during the attacks.

15:44.812 --> 15:46.293
And you'd like to know
if this could be the work...

15:46.492 --> 15:48.131
- ...of a lycanthrope.
- Yes.

15:48.332 --> 15:50.533
There are several
documented instances

15:50.732 --> 15:52.411
of lycanthropes attacking sheep

15:52.612 --> 15:54.492
because they're the natural prey
of the wolf.

15:54.692 --> 15:55.732
Well, this would seem to suggest

15:55.931 --> 15:59.613
the sufferer
was extremely delusional.

15:59.812 --> 16:03.612
It's a very rare
and a very strange condition.

16:03.812 --> 16:06.212
In this case, the killer
seems to have been lucid enough

16:06.412 --> 16:08.932
to have lured his victim
to his death.

16:09.532 --> 16:12.131
There is precedent
for such behavior.

16:12.332 --> 16:15.971
For example, a suspected lycanthrope
named Antonio Léger

16:16.171 --> 16:17.932
led a woman into a cave,

16:18.132 --> 16:21.212
where he subsequently killed
and devoured her.

16:21.412 --> 16:23.652
So, could your killer
be a lycanthrope?

16:23.853 --> 16:24.731
Absolutely.

16:24.931 --> 16:25.932
Is he one?

16:26.131 --> 16:28.092
I couldn't say
without examining him.

16:28.292 --> 16:30.132
But what I can tell you
with authority is

16:30.332 --> 16:34.852
that you're dealing with
a deeply disturbed individual.

16:38.491 --> 16:40.572
I've never ridden
in a carriage before.

16:40.771 --> 16:42.531
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:42.731 --> 16:45.451
I've cleaned them,
I've harnessed horses to them,

16:45.652 --> 16:47.612
but I've never rode in one.

16:48.931 --> 16:51.091
How did you come to work
at the stable?

16:51.291 --> 16:53.772
I wanted to be a copper,
but it didn't work out.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.890
I think you'd make
a fine copper.

16:56.091 --> 16:58.452
Your instincts are sound.

16:59.371 --> 17:02.491
Well, we both know
there aren't any Indian coppers.

17:04.252 --> 17:06.211
Doesn't mean there couldn't be.

17:09.771 --> 17:12.611
They tried to beat the Indian out of me
at the school.

17:12.810 --> 17:15.329
They should have beat
the color off of me, too.

17:16.251 --> 17:18.132
It'll be a long time
before they let someone like me

17:18.330 --> 17:20.050
wear that uniform.

17:27.131 --> 17:29.291
Detective,
your timing is impeccable.

17:29.490 --> 17:32.451
I was just about to leave
for an engagement with Mr. Poundsett.

17:32.650 --> 17:34.652
I see.
Well, then I'll be brief.

17:34.851 --> 17:36.531
Have you Mr. Hardy's
postmortem results?

17:36.731 --> 17:38.971
I do.
Nothing beyond the obvious.

17:39.171 --> 17:40.532
Death due to massive blood loss.

17:40.731 --> 17:43.331
Jugular and carotid arteries
both severed.

17:43.532 --> 17:45.930
Do you think it's possible
the wound could have been caused

17:46.130 --> 17:47.531
by sharpened fingernails?

17:47.731 --> 17:48.531
Fingernails?

17:48.731 --> 17:50.211
Part of a theory I'm developing,

17:50.411 --> 17:52.051
that the killer is suffering
from lycanthropy.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.651
And they're somehow emulating
the attack of a wolf?

17:54.850 --> 17:56.130
Exactly.

17:56.732 --> 17:58.850
Well, I suppose it...

17:59.050 --> 18:02.091
it might account
for the width of the gash.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.211
- But...
- But?

18:05.091 --> 18:06.290
The wound is symmetrical.

18:06.491 --> 18:07.811
A hand is not.

18:08.010 --> 18:09.330
There's only one opposing thumb.

18:09.530 --> 18:11.771
I'm also not sure
that fingernails could withstand

18:11.970 --> 18:13.731
the force required
to tear the flesh out.

18:13.931 --> 18:15.290
I see.

18:15.771 --> 18:16.572
Well, thank you.

18:16.771 --> 18:18.970
There is one other thing.

18:19.851 --> 18:23.050
Animal attacks are rare,
so I contacted some colleagues

18:23.251 --> 18:24.610
to see if they'd had
any experience with them.

18:24.811 --> 18:26.611
- And had they?
- Yes.

18:26.810 --> 18:28.330
Three, actually.
All in the last few months.

18:28.531 --> 18:30.171
I don't know
if there's any connection.

18:30.371 --> 18:32.490
Most interesting.
I'll be sure to look into it.

18:32.690 --> 18:33.851
Thank you very much, Doctor.

18:34.050 --> 18:34.931
Yes.

18:35.130 --> 18:38.931
Well, as I said, I have --
have an appointment.

18:39.130 --> 18:40.930
I have one of my own.

18:49.530 --> 18:51.410
I'm no expert, by any means,

18:51.610 --> 18:55.930
but I believe the werewolf curse
is caused by a Gypsy spell.

18:56.129 --> 18:57.211
The evil eye.

18:57.411 --> 18:58.850
Why the full moon?

18:59.050 --> 18:59.849
I don't know.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.690
I suppose it exerts
some sort of supernatural force.

19:02.889 --> 19:05.290
And after he kills,
does he turn back to human?

19:05.490 --> 19:06.290
I believe so.

19:06.490 --> 19:09.169
And with no recollection
of anything that's happened.

19:09.370 --> 19:11.450
What happens to his clothes
after he transforms?

19:11.649 --> 19:13.330
- Does he wake up naked?
- Does he wake up naked?

19:13.531 --> 19:16.289
I've often asked myself
that very question.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.330
Hmm.

19:19.770 --> 19:20.730
What is it?

19:20.930 --> 19:21.850
More shoe prints.

19:22.049 --> 19:22.930
The witness's.

19:23.130 --> 19:24.170
No.
These are different.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.130
The man the witness saw.

19:26.329 --> 19:27.730
Any wolf tracks?

19:30.130 --> 19:31.529
None.

19:32.090 --> 19:33.411
Well, we'd best see
where these lead.

19:41.410 --> 19:43.650
Enid, I must apologize to you.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.130
This case has been monopolizing my time.

19:46.329 --> 19:48.049
It's what you do.

19:48.249 --> 19:49.769
It is.

19:49.969 --> 19:51.929
However, I wanted to discuss

19:52.129 --> 19:55.929
what you brought up last night
about Dr. Ogden.

19:56.130 --> 19:57.930
And?

19:59.009 --> 20:00.530
And...

20:00.730 --> 20:03.810
I must confess
it has been difficult

20:04.010 --> 20:06.289
to put her out of my mind.

20:07.169 --> 20:08.530
I see.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.369
But I shall endeavor to do so.

20:12.289 --> 20:14.529
William, that's not enough.

20:14.729 --> 20:17.609
I don't know what more I can do.

20:17.810 --> 20:19.609
If it were just me,
I might be inclined

20:19.808 --> 20:22.609
to participate in some battle
for your affection.

20:22.809 --> 20:24.489
But there is no one else.

20:24.689 --> 20:27.730
William, of course there is.

20:27.930 --> 20:29.128
Alwyn.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.728
And as you know, he is
the most important thing in my life.

20:32.929 --> 20:37.649
I can't allow him
to grow attached to you...

20:37.849 --> 20:40.369
only to have you go back to her.

20:41.728 --> 20:42.929
I can't take that chance.

20:44.689 --> 20:46.328
Nor would I want you to.

20:47.249 --> 20:49.049
Then I need you to decide,
once and for all,

20:49.249 --> 20:51.328
what it is that you want.

21:03.610 --> 21:04.969
Where was he headed?
For the river?

21:05.169 --> 21:06.969
He wasn't going to the river.

21:08.050 --> 21:09.848
He went in there.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.409
Are you sure he came this way?

21:25.609 --> 21:27.089
Yes.

21:27.889 --> 21:28.729
No.

21:28.928 --> 21:31.049
There's been too much water.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.528
Well, if we've lost the trail,
he could be anywhere.

21:33.729 --> 21:35.729
Or he could be
up around the next bend.

21:36.528 --> 21:38.648
I think it prudent
we pay a visit to the station,

21:38.849 --> 21:39.969
report our findings,

21:40.168 --> 21:41.848
maybe enlist some help
while we're there.

21:42.049 --> 21:43.729
A search party would be good.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.968
Or maybe a trip to the armory.

21:46.168 --> 21:48.089
That'd be good, too.

22:04.809 --> 22:05.968
Used the sewers, did he?

22:06.168 --> 22:08.488
Good way to move a wolf unseen
through a city.

22:08.688 --> 22:11.689
Well, actually, sir,
we didn't find any wolf tracks.

22:12.328 --> 22:13.128
- None at all?
- No.

22:13.328 --> 22:15.529
We looked very carefully.
Your man would've found them.

22:15.728 --> 22:17.328
That's very strange.

22:17.528 --> 22:18.728
And the man you were tracking?

22:18.928 --> 22:20.689
We lost his trail in the sewer.

22:20.888 --> 22:23.128
Too much water.
Sorry, sir.

22:23.328 --> 22:24.249
Is there anything else?

22:24.448 --> 22:25.528
No.
That's good work, Jimmy.

22:25.727 --> 22:27.488
If we need you,
we'll send for you.

22:27.688 --> 22:28.969
Uh, sir, can I have a moment?

22:29.528 --> 22:30.327
What is it?

22:30.528 --> 22:32.088
- Uh, it's about Jimmy.
- What about him?

22:32.288 --> 22:34.728
He's proving very useful, sir, and...

22:36.328 --> 22:38.048
Well, sir, he's confessed to me
an interest

22:38.248 --> 22:39.687
in becoming a police officer,
so I thought that I --

22:39.887 --> 22:40.768
I'll stop you right there, Crabtree.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.328
Sir, he's got genuine ability.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.687
I don't doubt he's a smart lad.

22:43.888 --> 22:45.128
He's probably got a better head
on his shoulders

22:45.327 --> 22:46.127
than most of this lot
around here.

22:46.328 --> 22:48.327
Well, then why not g--
Why not give him a chance?

22:48.527 --> 22:50.608
Because I can't change
the world.

22:50.808 --> 22:52.328
I wish I could.

22:54.288 --> 22:55.928
Yes, sir.

23:00.769 --> 23:03.127
A doctor from Port Credit
was found three months ago

23:03.327 --> 23:05.128
with his throat ripped out.

23:06.566 --> 23:07.968
It was assumed to have been
a bear attack.

23:08.168 --> 23:10.007
Though it could just as easily have been
a wolf.

23:11.127 --> 23:13.847
Then in August, a local alderman
was found outside of Galt.

23:14.048 --> 23:16.647
His throat
had also been ripped out.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.288
Wild dogs were thought
to have been responsible.

23:19.488 --> 23:22.408
And then, finally, a Newcastle man
was found in his backyard.

23:22.607 --> 23:24.327
- And his throat was torn out.
- Precisely.

23:24.527 --> 23:26.527
- What profession?
- Lawyer.

23:27.087 --> 23:28.807
These three and Merrill Hardy.

23:29.007 --> 23:30.888
All killed in the same manner.

23:31.088 --> 23:32.207
All toffs.

23:32.408 --> 23:34.047
There's one more connection, sir.

23:34.248 --> 23:36.727
All of these murders took place
under the full moon.

23:36.927 --> 23:38.687
It's still a full moon tonight.

23:38.887 --> 23:39.687
Bloody hell.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.687
Then we'd better find out
where he's going to strike next,

23:41.888 --> 23:42.967
hadn't we?

23:46.168 --> 23:48.127
Sir, I made a few inquiries,

23:48.327 --> 23:50.647
and I found several connections
between the victims.

23:52.247 --> 23:53.967
These two men
went to university together

23:54.167 --> 23:56.007
but didn't get on very well.

23:56.206 --> 23:59.888
Um, these three all invested
in the same oil-drilling project

24:00.087 --> 24:02.447
in Pennsylvania,
which didn't pan out.

24:02.646 --> 24:04.887
And this man was a member
of the same gun club

24:05.087 --> 24:06.406
as Merrill Hardy at one point.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.167
Gun club?
Which gun club?

24:09.926 --> 24:11.567
The Radcliffe Sportsman's Club.

24:12.207 --> 24:14.887
Jacob Summers is a member
of that club.

24:15.647 --> 24:17.528
His wife said
he would be working late.

24:18.726 --> 24:20.767
Mr. Summers?

24:21.607 --> 24:24.567
That's odd.
It's completely dark.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.127
Mr. Summers?

24:29.126 --> 24:31.327
There's something wrong
with the lights.

24:32.206 --> 24:34.767
Sir, what's this?

24:36.525 --> 24:39.527
Shotgun blast, I'd say.

24:39.727 --> 24:41.127
Hello?

24:55.567 --> 24:59.845
I think we can safely eliminate
Mr. Summers as a suspect.

25:06.006 --> 25:07.527
Three shells spent.

25:07.727 --> 25:09.206
One through the door panel.

25:09.406 --> 25:10.726
The other two through the glass.

25:10.927 --> 25:12.326
He must have been
sitting here in the dark

25:12.527 --> 25:13.806
with his finger on the trigger.

25:14.005 --> 25:15.727
As though he was anticipating
an attack.

25:15.926 --> 25:17.325
- Mm.
- Just like Merrill Hardy.

25:17.526 --> 25:18.526
Sir.

25:19.206 --> 25:21.247
You may want to take a look
at this.

25:21.447 --> 25:23.126
The victim is in the picture.

25:23.326 --> 25:25.287
So, too, is Merrill Hardy.

25:33.326 --> 25:35.286
Not just Mr. Hardy, George.

25:35.846 --> 25:38.327
All five victims
are in this photograph.

25:38.526 --> 25:40.006
A hunting party.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.647
But who's the sixth fella?

25:41.846 --> 25:44.086
There's something familiar
about his face.

25:45.486 --> 25:47.445
Well, we'll talk tomorrow.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.326
Detective.

25:50.445 --> 25:52.726
He was with Mr. Summers
at the gun club.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.046
George, see if anyone
at the gun club can identify him.

25:56.246 --> 25:56.806
Sir.

25:57.006 --> 25:58.125
Seems we need to find out
a bit more

25:58.326 --> 26:00.725
about this little hunting party,
me old mucker.

26:00.925 --> 26:02.326
Indeed, sir.

26:02.525 --> 26:06.166
I'm sorry.
I don't... recognize him.

26:07.525 --> 26:10.006
I don't recognize any of them.

26:10.205 --> 26:13.405
Except Jake and...

26:13.606 --> 26:15.806
Merrill, of course.

26:16.525 --> 26:19.326
Mrs. Hardy, do you have any idea
where or when

26:19.525 --> 26:22.005
this photograph
might have been taken?

26:26.086 --> 26:28.526
Merrill's scarf.

26:28.726 --> 26:31.246
I knit it for his birthday.

26:31.445 --> 26:33.166
Last year.

26:35.005 --> 26:37.525
Where did he hunt last fall?

26:38.725 --> 26:42.526
I believe
it was out of Muskoka Lodge.

26:43.244 --> 26:48.125
I remember he came back
and he was very... subdued.

26:48.925 --> 26:51.166
Ill-tempered, really.

26:52.125 --> 26:54.485
We quarreled about it.

27:01.325 --> 27:02.725
Ah. Sir.

27:02.925 --> 27:05.045
We're still trying to determine
this gentleman's identity,

27:05.246 --> 27:06.525
but it's beginning to prove difficult.

27:06.724 --> 27:07.886
We know he's not a member
of the club,

27:08.085 --> 27:09.925
so most likely
he was Mr. Summers' guest.

27:10.125 --> 27:11.765
But then,
as far as pinpointing a name...

27:11.965 --> 27:13.565
I think I can help
narrow things down, George.

27:13.765 --> 27:16.164
- How's that?
- Telephone the Muskoka Lodge

27:16.365 --> 27:18.686
and get a list of every guest
that stayed there last fall.

27:18.886 --> 27:20.724
Compare that to the guest list
at the gun club.

27:20.925 --> 27:21.725
Right away, sir.

27:21.925 --> 27:25.325
Oh, also, Dr. Ogden
is here to see you.

27:28.325 --> 27:30.125
Dr. Ogden.

27:30.324 --> 27:31.685
What brings you here?

27:31.886 --> 27:34.925
I was conducting my postmortem
on Mr. Summers when I discovered

27:35.125 --> 27:36.724
something I felt
you should be made aware of.

27:36.925 --> 27:38.485
- What is it?
- I discovered this

27:38.685 --> 27:41.405
embedded in Mr. Summers'
fourth vertebra.

27:41.606 --> 27:43.324
The lower-right cuspid
of a canine.

27:43.524 --> 27:46.524
I suspect, given the size,
it belongs to a wolf.

27:47.164 --> 27:49.565
Which would seem to confirm
the inspector's theory

27:49.764 --> 27:51.163
of a wolf under a man's control.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.125
Actually, I don't think so.

27:53.324 --> 27:55.684
Teeth, especially healthy teeth,
don't just break off

27:55.884 --> 27:58.925
when ripping through flesh,
which made me curious.

27:59.565 --> 28:01.564
So I inspected the tooth
more closely,

28:01.765 --> 28:04.044
and I discovered
a straight groove

28:04.245 --> 28:06.124
running right through the center of the
breakage point.

28:06.325 --> 28:08.526
As though the tooth
has been drilled through.

28:08.725 --> 28:09.604
Exactly.

28:10.924 --> 28:14.524
Well, I thought you'd want to know
about it straightaway.

28:21.365 --> 28:23.804
William, we can't do this.

28:24.004 --> 28:25.925
We're both involved.

28:26.124 --> 28:26.924
William?

28:27.523 --> 28:28.724
William?

28:29.884 --> 28:30.724
I'm sorry.

28:30.924 --> 28:32.724
My mind was elsewhere.

28:32.924 --> 28:34.484
Thank you, Doctor.

28:34.685 --> 28:36.764
You're welcome, Detective.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.644
Enid, I'm afraid you're right.

28:52.204 --> 28:54.004
I don't think my feelings
for Dr. Ogden

28:54.203 --> 28:56.724
will be dispelled anytime soon.

28:58.525 --> 29:00.523
I see.

29:04.323 --> 29:07.204
But you and Alwyn
have come to mean so much to me.

29:07.404 --> 29:08.964
And you to us.

29:11.445 --> 29:12.883
I confess that I was hoping

29:13.084 --> 29:15.324
you would come
to a different decision.

29:18.124 --> 29:22.323
I never meant to cause
either of you any pain.

29:23.003 --> 29:25.165
I know.

29:27.083 --> 29:29.924
But I think it's best
that you go.

29:39.563 --> 29:41.203
So, this is it, then?

29:43.204 --> 29:45.564
What more could there be?

30:02.963 --> 30:05.324
Goodbye, William.

30:11.042 --> 30:13.723
Goodbye, Enid.

30:22.683 --> 30:24.522
Mother, are you all right?

30:24.722 --> 30:26.883
Come.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.562
Come sit with me awhile.

30:31.042 --> 30:34.522
There's something
we need to talk about.

30:35.684 --> 30:37.323
The tooth was machined, you say?

30:37.523 --> 30:38.563
But why?

30:38.763 --> 30:40.723
So it could be bolted
to some form of device.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.282
I believe that's how the killer
is ripping the throats out.

30:43.483 --> 30:45.124
To create the impression
of a wolf.

30:45.323 --> 30:46.323
Bloody devilish.

30:46.523 --> 30:47.922
Sir, the man in the photo,

30:48.122 --> 30:49.643
we have a name for him --
Frank Jenson.

30:49.843 --> 30:50.642
Very good, George.

30:50.843 --> 30:52.322
Murdoch, keep your wits
about you.

30:52.523 --> 30:53.842
This Jenson
may be another victim,

30:54.043 --> 30:56.363
but he could just as easily
be the killer.

30:56.562 --> 30:58.162
Yes, sir.

31:04.242 --> 31:05.922
Be prepared for anything, George.

31:06.123 --> 31:08.002
Sir.

31:11.522 --> 31:12.963
Police!

31:13.763 --> 31:15.523
Mr. Jenson?

31:16.322 --> 31:17.883
Frank Jenson?

31:43.922 --> 31:45.443
Mr. Jenson.

31:52.962 --> 31:54.322
Put down the gun, Mr. Jenson.

31:56.802 --> 31:58.603
Are you all right?

32:00.321 --> 32:01.482
It's impossible.

32:02.522 --> 32:03.682
Where did he go?

32:09.242 --> 32:10.282
We'll never catch him now.

32:10.481 --> 32:12.402
He's got too much
of a head start.

32:12.603 --> 32:14.481
We'll need Jimmy again.

32:46.801 --> 32:47.761
He went in there.

32:47.961 --> 32:49.522
The sewers again.

32:49.721 --> 32:51.361
Can you track him?

32:51.561 --> 32:53.442
I'll try.

33:33.841 --> 33:35.641
- What is it?
- Shh.

33:38.601 --> 33:40.440
Something's moving.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.561
- I don't hear anything.
- No.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.921
Something's in here with us.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.921
Sir! Sir!

34:08.000 --> 34:09.880
Sir.
Are you all right?

34:10.081 --> 34:11.760
He had me by the throat.

34:11.958 --> 34:12.920
It didn't bite?

34:13.121 --> 34:14.320
I don't know.

34:14.521 --> 34:17.880
He had me and...
just released me.

34:18.081 --> 34:19.440
Jimmy, are you all right?

34:19.639 --> 34:20.440
Fine.

34:20.639 --> 34:22.159
He went this way.

34:22.920 --> 34:26.001
Sir, we came down here
looking for a man, but what I saw --

34:26.201 --> 34:27.121
That was a wolf.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.719
Not a wolf, George.

34:28.920 --> 34:29.920
A wolf would have killed me.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.199
He went out.

34:48.599 --> 34:51.918
Sir, this is the sewer outlet
near the Jamison Foundry.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.639
This would seem to confirm
that he's using the sewers

34:54.840 --> 34:56.760
to access different parts
of the city.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.201
So what should we do now?
Keep tracking him?

34:59.401 --> 35:00.799
No.

35:01.320 --> 35:04.520
I think I know of a quicker route
to finding our killer.

35:05.399 --> 35:08.640
What happened
on that hunting trip, Mr. Jenson?

35:09.839 --> 35:11.320
Don't feel like talking?

35:11.880 --> 35:14.399
Well, sunshine, let me remind you --
Whatever did happen

35:14.600 --> 35:17.520
brought the wrath of hell down
on every man that was with you.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.120
Perhaps you should tell us.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.120
Unless you want to take
your chances the next full moon.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.079
It was an accident.

35:28.639 --> 35:30.040
What was?

35:30.520 --> 35:31.760
It was Jake
who pulled the trigger,

35:31.959 --> 35:33.600
but it wasn't his fault.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.440
It was no one's fault.

35:35.639 --> 35:36.999
We thought it was some animal.

35:37.199 --> 35:38.880
But it wasn't.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.480
Who was shot, Mr. Jenson?

35:43.480 --> 35:45.200
Our guide.

35:46.280 --> 35:48.320
An Indian. I don't --
I don't know his name.

35:48.959 --> 35:51.199
He hit him square in the chest.
There was nothing to be done.

35:52.840 --> 35:56.360
So he died.
Then what happened?

35:57.520 --> 35:58.919
He didn't exactly die.

35:59.119 --> 36:02.200
What do you mean,
"didn't exactly die"?

36:02.399 --> 36:04.519
No, but he was going to.
It was clear.

36:04.719 --> 36:06.320
He had a chest wound,
for God's sake.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.078
- What did you do?
- What -- What could we do?

36:09.280 --> 36:11.719
- The -- The sun was setting.
- You didn't carry him out?

36:12.879 --> 36:14.919
You left him to die -- alone?

36:15.800 --> 36:17.919
We buried him in branches
and leaves.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.480
But he couldn't have lived.

36:22.679 --> 36:23.919
He couldn't have.

36:24.119 --> 36:26.519
Clearly, the man they shot survived.

36:26.719 --> 36:28.719
And now he's seeking
the bloodiest revenge imaginable.

36:28.919 --> 36:30.918
But, sir, whatever attacked us
was not a man.

36:31.119 --> 36:31.959
It was a wolf.

36:32.158 --> 36:33.519
- Or at least some sort of --
- George.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.199
It was a man dressed as a wolf.

36:36.399 --> 36:37.519
Why would he do that?

36:37.719 --> 36:39.079
Perhaps he was
a form of lycanthrope

36:39.280 --> 36:41.479
and the wolf held
some psychological meaning for him.

36:42.199 --> 36:44.918
Actually, sir,
I think he may be a shaman.

36:45.119 --> 36:45.919
A shaman?

36:46.119 --> 36:47.159
We had one in our village.

36:47.359 --> 36:48.638
And sometimes when he danced,

36:48.839 --> 36:51.318
he wore the head
and the skin of a wolf.

36:51.519 --> 36:52.760
Sounds like
what you're describing.

36:52.960 --> 36:53.759
It does.

36:53.958 --> 36:56.319
But what would a shaman be doing working
as a hunting guide?

36:57.359 --> 36:59.719
The missionaries put an end
to the shaman.

36:59.919 --> 37:03.118
Now we have doctors
and the good Lord Jesus.

37:03.319 --> 37:05.359
So this shaman
goes from being a high priest

37:05.559 --> 37:07.319
to a lackey for a bunch
of country-club fat cats.

37:07.518 --> 37:08.758
Who care so little for him,

37:08.958 --> 37:10.399
they leave him to die
in the cold and dark.

37:10.599 --> 37:12.318
And can't even remember
his name.

37:12.518 --> 37:14.959
Can't say I blame him
for tearing their throats out.

37:15.159 --> 37:17.879
But he's killed five men.
And the law is the law.

37:18.078 --> 37:19.960
George, contact
the Muskoka Lodge.

37:20.159 --> 37:21.558
See if anyone there
remembers this man.

37:21.759 --> 37:23.119
Sir.

37:25.757 --> 37:28.118
Now, how do you propose
we find him?

37:30.838 --> 37:34.318
This is a map of the sewer lines
that run beneath the city.

37:34.518 --> 37:36.599
This is where he entered
the system,

37:36.799 --> 37:38.558
near Frank Jensen's house.

37:38.758 --> 37:41.558
This is where
the old Jamison Foundry is...

37:41.759 --> 37:43.478
- ...where Mr. Hardy was found.
- Bloody hell, Murdoch.

37:43.679 --> 37:44.998
There must be a hundred miles
of sewer lines.

37:45.198 --> 37:46.919
- He could be anywhere.
- Not anywhere, sir.

37:47.119 --> 37:49.559
You see, he can only travel
these main lines.

37:49.758 --> 37:52.999
So if we post men at these
main entrances and intersections,

37:53.198 --> 37:54.558
he'll be trapped down there.

38:02.918 --> 38:04.639
- Sir.
- What is it?

38:04.838 --> 38:06.398
There's a light, sir.

38:07.078 --> 38:08.758
Turn off the lamp.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.397
This must be his lair.

38:25.598 --> 38:27.638
So where is he?

38:30.918 --> 38:32.438
His bedding is still warm.

38:32.637 --> 38:34.518
Probably heard us coming.

38:35.198 --> 38:36.199
Sir.

38:39.919 --> 38:41.957
This must be what he used.

38:42.517 --> 38:44.597
Similar to a bear trap.

38:55.517 --> 38:56.918
That would go
through a man's throat

38:57.118 --> 38:59.519
like a knife through butter.

39:08.278 --> 39:09.877
We know who you are.

39:10.437 --> 39:12.237
We know what's happened to you.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.237
It's all over.

39:18.277 --> 39:20.078
He's got a knife, sir.

39:24.837 --> 39:26.837
Frank Jenson is in jail.

39:27.037 --> 39:30.358
Let justice take its course.
Surrender yourself peacefully.

39:30.557 --> 39:32.717
You're up against
armed officers.

39:34.797 --> 39:36.157
Stand down!

39:37.717 --> 39:39.237
Stand down!

39:45.157 --> 39:47.917
George!
George, get help now!

39:48.117 --> 39:51.157
Shh. Don't speak.
Save your strength.

39:55.477 --> 39:56.517
Jimmy, he wants you.

40:02.597 --> 40:04.716
Maheengun.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.277
What did he say?

40:24.477 --> 40:25.277
Maheengun.

40:25.477 --> 40:26.837
What does that mean?

40:27.037 --> 40:30.317
It's an Ojibwa word for "wolf."

40:32.036 --> 40:34.717
I think that was his real name, sir.

40:43.796 --> 40:46.517
The perfect tool
for a murderous lycanthrope.

40:46.717 --> 40:48.116
Would that be
your diagnosis, then?

40:48.316 --> 40:51.717
No. He was most likely suffering
from some kind of psychosis.

40:51.916 --> 40:54.717
He adopted the wolf motif
to reclaim his identity

40:54.916 --> 40:56.798
and terrify his victims.

40:56.997 --> 40:58.676
I imagine, uh, it worked.

40:58.876 --> 41:00.437
What did the full moon
have to do with it?

41:00.637 --> 41:01.916
Poetic justice.

41:02.116 --> 41:03.317
They left him to die
on a full moon.

41:03.517 --> 41:05.916
The man clearly had a flair
for the dramatic.

41:06.117 --> 41:08.236
Yes, he did.
Right to the bloody end.

41:08.796 --> 41:11.276
What I don't understand
is why he came at us like that.

41:11.475 --> 41:13.116
He must have known
we would shoot him down.

41:13.317 --> 41:14.717
Perhaps that's why he did it.

41:14.916 --> 41:17.116
After all, what did he
really have to live for?

41:17.316 --> 41:18.597
He knew he was facing the noose.

41:18.796 --> 41:20.076
Furthermore,
with Jenson arrested,

41:20.276 --> 41:21.996
he'd done what he set out to do.

41:22.196 --> 41:24.515
His desire for revenge
gave him the strength to live.

41:24.716 --> 41:27.197
- Now, with that gone...
- Yes, I suppose.

41:27.396 --> 41:29.795
Still, hell of a thing.

41:29.996 --> 41:31.916
I've never killed a man
like that before.

41:32.116 --> 41:34.076
- But, sir, the regiment.
- Oh, that's different.

41:34.276 --> 41:36.876
You very rarely
come face-to-face.

41:37.396 --> 41:40.117
Last night, I looked this man in the eye
as I pulled the trigger.

41:40.316 --> 41:43.636
Well, if it's any consolation,
you most likely saved my life.

41:43.836 --> 41:46.195
Oh, it's all water
under the bridge now.

41:46.995 --> 41:48.835
Dr. Roberts,
thank you very much.

41:49.036 --> 41:51.196
Your insights
are most appreciated.

41:51.395 --> 41:53.916
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have someplace I need to be.

41:54.117 --> 41:55.635
As do I.

41:58.596 --> 41:59.635
What's this, then?

41:59.836 --> 42:00.755
My card.

42:00.956 --> 42:04.716
Should you feel the need
to discuss matters, give me a call.

42:05.315 --> 42:06.716
I don't think
there's anything wrong with me

42:06.916 --> 42:09.634
that a couple of whiskeys
won't sort out, Doctor.

42:09.835 --> 42:11.555
As you wish.

42:21.835 --> 42:22.835
Jimmy.

42:23.035 --> 42:24.156
You off, then?

42:24.355 --> 42:25.516
Back to the stables.

42:26.355 --> 42:28.035
Well, it was a pleasure
working with you.

42:28.235 --> 42:29.155
But, you know, in my opinion,

42:29.355 --> 42:31.116
the constabulary
are wasting your talents.

42:31.315 --> 42:33.635
Well, there's no changing
the world, George.

42:33.836 --> 42:35.516
Well, maybe not.

42:35.715 --> 42:36.915
But this might help you.

42:37.115 --> 42:37.915
What's this?

42:38.115 --> 42:40.076
This is a friend of mine
who works at the Pinkertons.

42:40.276 --> 42:42.115
I told him about you.
He's very keen.

42:42.315 --> 42:44.276
You should go to the local office
and ask for him.

42:45.356 --> 42:46.315
I'll think about it.

42:46.514 --> 42:48.115
You do that.

43:03.075 --> 43:04.675
Master Alwyn.

43:04.875 --> 43:06.876
Hello, Mr. Murdoch.

43:07.076 --> 43:09.515
I don't know where my mother is.

43:09.714 --> 43:11.316
Oh, that's all right.

43:11.515 --> 43:13.675
Actually, I'm here to see you.

43:14.355 --> 43:17.755
Really? Mother said you
wouldn't be coming by anymore.

43:22.715 --> 43:23.915
She's right.

43:24.115 --> 43:26.115
I won't be.

43:26.314 --> 43:28.715
So I brought this for you.

43:31.195 --> 43:32.914
"From the Earth to the Moon."

43:33.115 --> 43:34.115
Mm.

43:34.315 --> 43:35.794
It's about
a group of adventurers

43:35.994 --> 43:38.354
who build a cannon
that shoots them to the moon.

43:38.555 --> 43:40.755
Is that even possible?

43:41.355 --> 43:42.955
Well, it's a story.

43:43.154 --> 43:45.794
I suppose anything is possible
in stories.

43:48.115 --> 43:54.314
But if you could build something
that could push you faster

43:54.515 --> 43:57.276
than the earth's gravity
pulls you down...

43:58.274 --> 44:01.475
...you could go faster,
faster, faster,

44:01.674 --> 44:03.995
until you reach escape velocity,

44:04.195 --> 44:07.874
and then the moon, that's just
the beginning of your journey.

44:08.074 --> 44:09.114
That could work?

44:09.714 --> 44:10.515
Theoretically.

44:10.715 --> 44:14.874
Maybe not in my lifetime,
but quite possibly in yours.

44:19.554 --> 44:22.234
"William Henry Murdoch."

44:22.434 --> 44:25.634
It was my favorite book
when I was a boy.

44:26.834 --> 44:28.474
Thank you, Mr. Murdoch.

44:29.314 --> 44:31.514
You're very welcome.

44:35.914 --> 44:37.874
Mr. Murdoch?

44:38.674 --> 44:40.475
Can I still come and see you?

44:42.994 --> 44:44.074
Anytime, Alwyn.

44:45.354 --> 44:47.354
Anytime.
