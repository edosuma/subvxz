But the cement must be
chipped very carefully

02:50.805 --> 02:53.339
if you want the mold
of the Batman's cowl.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.575
Oh, you can take it
apart in sections

02:55.577 --> 02:58.444
and glue it back together
again to form a mold.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.447
I will not disfigure
my friend, the Batman.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.348
Oh, Batman, Batman.

03:02.350 --> 03:06.452
He couldn't possibly be alive
inside that plaster shroud.

03:06.454 --> 03:06.953
Hey, boss.

03:06.955 --> 03:10.490
That means he's won't be
needing that Batmobile no more.

03:10.492 --> 03:11.358
Good thinking.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.060
It'll make an
excellent getaway car.

03:14.062 --> 03:14.961
Go warm it up.

03:25.974 --> 03:28.308
The statue, it's coming alive.

03:28.310 --> 03:31.011
Apple seed!

03:31.013 --> 03:32.078
Impossible.

03:38.353 --> 03:41.221
It's diabolical.

03:43.992 --> 03:44.457
Curses.

03:44.459 --> 03:47.260
My super mesmerizer
is on the brink.

03:47.262 --> 03:48.328
To the Batmobile.

03:48.330 --> 03:49.529
I'll go after them.

03:49.531 --> 03:53.400
- After the Mad Hatter.
- No, no, Mr. Marbot.

03:53.402 --> 03:55.302
It's too dangerous.

03:55.304 --> 03:57.671
- Robin.
- Batman.

03:57.673 --> 03:59.272
Robin.

04:02.577 --> 04:04.444
Start her up, Dicer.

04:20.529 --> 04:22.529
- Are you alright?
- Never better.

04:22.531 --> 04:24.697
Well, I'm used to seeing
you do the impossible.

04:24.699 --> 04:27.333
But getting out of that
plaster tomb was impossible.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.369
Much easier that
it seemed, Robin.

04:29.371 --> 04:31.271
I simply held by breath.

04:31.273 --> 04:32.205
Holy frog-man!

04:32.207 --> 04:34.340
Well, we should help
<i> Monsieur</i> Marbot

04:34.342 --> 04:35.441
clean up this mess.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.576
Oh, no, no, no, Batman.

04:36.578 --> 04:39.179
You saved my life
also your own.

04:39.181 --> 04:40.446
That is enough for one day.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.448
Next time you come
to pose for me.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.551
We start the statue
all over again.

04:44.553 --> 04:45.919
<i> - Oui?</i>
<i> - Oui.</i>

04:45.921 --> 04:47.554
The next time I come to pose

04:47.556 --> 04:48.755
there won't be any
interruptions.

04:48.757 --> 04:51.524
Come on, Robin,
we have work to do.

05:14.249 --> 05:16.783
I find being
out-maneuvered by the Mad Hatter

05:16.785 --> 05:18.318
somewhat irritating.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.553
I know what you mean.

05:20.555 --> 05:23.856
There must be
some insidious plan.

05:23.858 --> 05:24.757
Some overall scheme.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.927
Who'd steal five hats
and five people with them

05:27.929 --> 05:29.762
to gain his nefarious end?

05:29.764 --> 05:31.998
And what did
he mean, when he said

05:32.000 --> 05:35.468
my cowl would
be his 13th hat?

05:35.470 --> 05:36.002
Did he say that?

05:36.004 --> 05:40.273
Yes, when I told him
I was on to his masquerade.

05:40.275 --> 05:43.343
I have it,
5 from 13 is 8.

05:43.345 --> 05:45.345
How right you are.

05:45.347 --> 05:48.615
Then he must be planning
to snatch eight more hats

05:48.617 --> 05:49.449
and eight more people.

05:49.451 --> 05:52.919
Or already has
and we don't know about it.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.492
Yes, Batman.

05:59.494 --> 06:03.263
Commissioner, have you
any more reports of hat thefts

06:03.265 --> 06:04.264
or vanishing people?

06:04.266 --> 06:05.031
As a matter of fact, yes.

06:05.033 --> 06:07.934
Word is slowly reaching us
that six other fine citizens

06:07.936 --> 06:10.370
have disappeared
in the last few days.

06:10.372 --> 06:11.604
Along with their headwear.

06:11.606 --> 06:13.539
I'll get back to you.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.676
The police department's
on it's toes.

06:16.678 --> 06:18.811
Six more kidnappings.

06:18.813 --> 06:22.482
Six, plus the five we
know about make eleven.

06:22.484 --> 06:25.418
Your cowl's the 13th,
that leaves--

06:25.420 --> 06:27.754
One to go...the 12th.

06:27.756 --> 06:30.023
12 hats, 12 people.

06:30.025 --> 06:30.923
But why, Robin?

06:30.925 --> 06:33.493
What comes in twelve's?

06:33.495 --> 06:35.495
Donuts!

06:35.497 --> 06:37.063
Um, horse power.

06:37.065 --> 06:38.698
Um, amendments.

06:38.700 --> 06:39.799
Mile limits?

06:39.801 --> 06:41.334
Noon-midnight!

06:41.336 --> 06:42.869
Oh, that's not
quite it.

06:42.871 --> 06:46.306
- Twelve.
- A dozen?

06:46.775 --> 06:48.641
Shall we activate
the bat computer?

06:48.643 --> 06:50.043
That sounds
like a good idea.

06:50.045 --> 06:52.745
Feed it a question
about dozens.

07:01.456 --> 07:07.327
A dozen, a collection of
12 such as a dozen men or women.

07:07.462 --> 07:11.597
Or...a dozen men and women!

07:11.599 --> 07:12.565
A jury, jurors!

07:12.567 --> 07:14.600
Of course, Robin,
that's what he was after

07:14.602 --> 07:17.003
the 12 hats of
the jury that convicted him.

07:17.005 --> 07:22.542
And the jurors, Madam Magda,
the chef, the fire chief

07:22.544 --> 07:25.611
they were all on that jury.

07:26.348 --> 07:28.915
How could
I have been so stupid?

07:28.917 --> 07:30.917
Oh no, Batman,
you've been pretty busy.

07:30.919 --> 07:35.621
One hat left, the key
that will hoist our opponent

07:35.623 --> 07:37.623
on his own petard!

07:40.929 --> 07:42.128
Yes, I-I realize that.

07:42.864 --> 07:46.733
Charlie, hold on a second,
will you please?

07:50.004 --> 07:50.737
Yes, Batman.

07:50.739 --> 07:52.138
We maybe on to something
important, commissioner.

07:52.140 --> 07:55.508
I need the names of the 12
jurors on Mad Hatter's trial.

07:55.510 --> 07:59.712
Yes but it may take a little
while, I'll call you back.

07:59.714 --> 08:01.881
Right.

08:03.551 --> 08:07.553
Ahem, I thought I might
find you here, sir.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.621
Yes, Alfred.

08:08.623 --> 08:09.689
It's Mrs. Cooper, sir.

08:09.691 --> 08:11.691
Dinner's almost ready
and she wondered

08:11.693 --> 08:14.427
if you and Master Robin
were back from uh..

08:14.429 --> 08:17.530
...sighting that
fork tailed petrel

08:17.532 --> 08:19.665
and black-footed
albatross, sir.

08:19.667 --> 08:23.469
Tell her we just got back,
but we may be taking off again.

08:23.471 --> 08:26.506
Oh dear me,
how I wish I'd put it, sir?

08:26.508 --> 08:27.807
Yes, commissioner.

08:27.809 --> 08:31.611
Uh, Batman, I have the jury list
here, what did you want to know?

08:31.613 --> 08:35.414
I'd like the name of
the 12th juror, the last one.

08:35.417 --> 08:36.115
The 12th huh?

08:36.116 --> 08:39.751
Uh...Turkey Bowinkle?

08:39.754 --> 08:42.121
Oh, he owns
the Bowinkle's Bowl-O-Drome.

08:42.123 --> 08:46.025
Have you a record of Bowinkle's
hat being stolen recently?

08:46.027 --> 08:48.694
Or of Bowinkle being stolen?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.997
'No, we have no report of that.'

08:50.999 --> 08:54.734
Good. I'll
call you later.

08:54.736 --> 08:59.138
Alfred, tell Mrs. Cooper that
we called from Slater Sleuth..

08:59.140 --> 09:02.208
'...and that we sighted
some night flying birds.'

09:02.210 --> 09:05.211
And tell her we'll
be late for dinner.

09:05.213 --> 09:05.945
Very good, sir.

09:05.947 --> 09:09.582
On second thought, Alfred, tell
her, you'll be late for dinner.

09:09.584 --> 09:12.352
- 'Me, sir?'
- The 12th juror is Bowinkle.

09:12.354 --> 09:14.854
Turkey Bowinkle.
He owns a bowling alley.

09:14.856 --> 09:16.055
- A bowler!
- Precisely.

09:16.057 --> 09:18.891
What more fitting head piece
for the mad hatter to steal.

09:18.893 --> 09:22.595
Our job is to get Alfred there
before our cunning adversary

09:22.597 --> 09:27.133
and use the 12th hat
to trap him once and for all.

09:27.135 --> 09:27.733
Me, sir?

09:27.735 --> 09:31.604
Our cunning antagonist
knows we're after him, Alfred.

09:31.606 --> 09:34.774
We must do nothing
to excite attention.

09:35.477 --> 09:38.778
I want you take
this, bat-homing transmitter.

09:38.780 --> 09:42.048
'Pay a call on Turkey Bowinkle,
at the Bowl-O-Drome.'

09:42.050 --> 09:46.085
'I want you to place it in
his hat before it's snatched.'

09:46.087 --> 09:48.654
That way we'll be
able to trace him

09:48.656 --> 09:52.792
with a homing receiver
in the Batmobile.

09:53.161 --> 09:55.728
If I maybe allowed, sir.

09:55.730 --> 09:57.263
Roger!

09:58.800 --> 10:01.167
Bowinkle?
It's just a family name.

10:01.169 --> 10:02.001
That's what I thought.

10:02.003 --> 10:05.571
You see,
I specialize in Genealogy.

10:06.641 --> 10:07.507
Ghosts?

10:07.509 --> 10:08.074
Family trees.

10:08.076 --> 10:12.211
When I ran across your name
in the book, I was fascinated.

10:12.213 --> 10:14.046
Turkey Bowinkle hmm.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.616
'You doubt if it has a
distinguished pedigree?'

10:16.618 --> 10:20.586
I got license to run this joint,
if that's what you mean?

10:20.588 --> 10:21.153
Now, tell me..

10:21.155 --> 10:25.091
...perhaps if you have some
records of your family lineage..

10:25.093 --> 10:25.958
...in your office, hmm?

10:25.960 --> 10:28.895
All I got in
my office is my hat.

10:28.897 --> 10:31.197
Your..
Well..

10:31.199 --> 10:33.733
...maybe that could
tell me something.

10:33.735 --> 10:35.335
It's just a little hat.

10:35.337 --> 10:36.469
You never can tell Mr. Bowinkle.

10:36.471 --> 10:40.673
What maybe useful
in tracing a person's descent.

10:40.675 --> 10:41.074
Descent?

10:41.076 --> 10:44.010
It ain't no descent
to run a bowling alley.

10:44.012 --> 10:45.778
I mean, family descent.

10:45.780 --> 10:48.114
The natural order of succession

10:48.116 --> 10:50.116
from one's ancestors.

10:50.118 --> 10:53.052
Or even older forms.

10:53.054 --> 10:54.554
Monkeys?

10:54.556 --> 10:55.388
Sorry buddy.

10:55.690 --> 10:58.090
Turkey ain't no handle
handed down from my grandpa.

10:58.092 --> 11:01.227
It's a nick name, in
the lingo of ten pins..

11:01.229 --> 11:03.095
..it means three strikes.

11:03.097 --> 11:05.865
And Bowinkle means...Bowinkle.

11:05.867 --> 11:09.001
Now, nevertheless I would like
to take a look at that hat.

11:09.003 --> 11:13.673
Perhaps the uh, the head size
might prove informative.

11:13.675 --> 11:14.807
Seven and five eighth's.

11:14.809 --> 11:18.277
That put an extra limb
on the family elm?

11:26.421 --> 11:29.922
That's Bowinkle at
the counter with the old guy.

11:29.924 --> 11:33.092
Butter him up, find out where
the hat is, signal me

11:33.094 --> 11:34.394
and keep him occupied.

11:34.396 --> 11:36.429
Whatever your say, Jervis.

11:40.568 --> 11:41.100
Yes, ma'am.

11:41.402 --> 11:45.872
Mr. Bowinkle,
I'm from 'Male Modes'.

11:45.874 --> 11:46.506
Yeah?

11:47.008 --> 11:51.311
It's a magazine,
devoted men's fashion.

11:51.313 --> 11:51.711
Oh.

11:52.313 --> 11:56.916
I'm sure you'll be glad to know
you're this week's prize winner.

11:56.918 --> 12:00.920
The best headed man
in Gotham City.

12:00.922 --> 12:01.754
And what is this?

12:02.156 --> 12:04.890
Thought that old bowl attracted
so much attention before.

12:04.892 --> 12:08.227
- And this man here--
- I really must be going.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.663
It's been pleasant
talking to you.

12:10.665 --> 12:16.068
Perhaps we can go into your
bloodline some other time.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.137
Your bloodline?

12:18.139 --> 12:19.605
That sounds icky.

12:19.607 --> 12:21.174
Just some cook.

12:27.215 --> 12:28.214
Anyway, Mr. Bowinkle..

12:28.216 --> 12:33.453
...I hoped you would extend me
the courtesy of an interview.

12:33.455 --> 12:33.986
Sure, shoot.

12:33.988 --> 12:38.458
Where is the prize winning
little head piece right now?

12:38.460 --> 12:41.861
Right now, I figure
it's upstairs on my desk.

12:41.863 --> 12:42.462
Waitin'.

12:42.464 --> 12:45.932
Not knowin' it's headed
for fame and fortune.

13:07.589 --> 13:09.088
Thank you.

13:54.035 --> 13:55.167
'Why me lady?'

13:55.169 --> 13:58.204
'There must be lot more
with fancy ol' bonnets'

13:58.206 --> 13:59.105
'than an ol' bowler?'

13:59.107 --> 14:02.808
Well, how 'Male Modes'
selects it's weekly winners

14:02.810 --> 14:04.176
is of course our secret.

14:04.178 --> 14:11.851
But I suspect your virile charm
had something to do with it.

14:11.853 --> 14:12.285
Yeah?

14:12.287 --> 14:16.923
Well, maybe that virile charm
would like to buy you something.

14:16.925 --> 14:18.024
What would you like?

14:18.026 --> 14:19.692
On the house.

14:20.028 --> 14:24.364
Who let you out of the jug?
What're you doin' with my hat?

14:24.366 --> 14:26.132
That's it, Lisa, get lost.

14:26.634 --> 14:29.568
Just repaying old debts,
Mr. Bowinkle.

14:29.570 --> 14:33.572
It took unanimous vote of that
jury to send me up the river.

14:33.574 --> 14:37.176
Yeah, well, I'm casting
another ballot right now.

14:45.653 --> 14:49.355
Do you usually carry
a homing bat transmitter

14:49.357 --> 14:51.924
in your bowler, Mr. Bowinkle?

14:51.926 --> 14:54.460
I don't know how that
thing got in there.

14:54.462 --> 14:55.327
I think I do.

14:55.429 --> 14:59.865
And I think Batman will end up
in my hat factory after all.

14:59.867 --> 15:02.434
What's Batman got
to do with it?

15:09.343 --> 15:15.381
<i> So the Mad Hatter</i>
<i> gets his 12th juror.</i>

15:20.022 --> 15:22.689
Beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful!

15:22.691 --> 15:26.260
Imagine, shearing
Batman like a rabbit.

15:28.063 --> 15:32.633
Or stretching him
into any form I wish.

15:32.635 --> 15:36.570
Or shrinking him
and sizing him.

15:36.572 --> 15:37.838
Why, I..

15:37.840 --> 15:40.807
...I'll make him
into a sun bonnet.

15:40.809 --> 15:44.211
Or a ten gallon hat or a fizz.

15:44.213 --> 15:45.979
A fizz..

15:45.981 --> 15:48.181
...yes a fizz, I'll dye him red.

15:48.183 --> 15:53.120
I'll buy myself a camel and go
riding off into the desert.

15:53.122 --> 15:56.890
Wearing a tribal chieftain's
flowing robes..

15:56.892 --> 15:59.960
...and Batman on my head.

16:00.229 --> 16:01.328
He's flipped his lid.

16:01.330 --> 16:04.665
'What're you mumbling about?'

16:04.800 --> 16:08.101
My idle flights of fancy?
My little day dreams?

16:08.103 --> 16:10.237
Do nothing more
than that believe me

16:10.239 --> 16:12.172
I'm a very practical man.

16:12.174 --> 16:16.310
I already have my 12 jurors'
hats and my 12 jurors.

16:16.312 --> 16:20.981
All I need now...
is Batman's cowl.

16:20.983 --> 16:23.317
And the caped crusader
out of the way.

16:23.319 --> 16:25.019
And my job will be complete.

16:25.021 --> 16:26.453
Yeah, but when do we eat?

16:26.455 --> 16:29.723
'When I'm paid
my fabulous ransom.'

16:29.725 --> 16:31.492
Imagine a <i> vouz.</i>

16:31.494 --> 16:35.362
Owning the
Gothsonian institution's

16:35.364 --> 16:39.466
priceless collection
of Presidential head gear.

16:39.468 --> 16:41.535
Ooh!

16:43.739 --> 16:44.638
I think it's high time

16:44.640 --> 16:47.741
the rightful owners
of those hats were wearing them.

16:47.743 --> 16:50.944
Yeah but the real
jury's still out.

16:58.087 --> 17:01.355
Turkey's bowler can't
be far from here.

17:03.526 --> 17:06.359
The hideout must be
in this old warehouse.

17:06.362 --> 17:07.328
Call, Commissioner Gordon

17:07.329 --> 17:10.597
tell him we found
the Mad Hatter's lair.

17:23.445 --> 17:25.079
It's working, they found us.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.181
Just like I planned.

17:27.183 --> 17:28.816
It's a long way up.

17:28.818 --> 17:31.552
'You're right.'

17:31.554 --> 17:33.120
Stand clear.

17:45.134 --> 17:47.701
They're climbing up the wall.

17:47.703 --> 17:49.637
Places, everyone.

17:52.708 --> 17:56.710
What a pleasant
surprise awaits them.

17:58.147 --> 18:01.682
Gosh, Batman, you'd
think we were human flies.

18:01.684 --> 18:03.818
That's all in the game, Robin.

18:03.820 --> 18:07.288
That sure is one way
of looking at it.

18:30.913 --> 18:34.881
I'm extremely sorry
about all these citizens.

18:36.785 --> 18:38.819
We meet again,
dynamic duo.

18:38.821 --> 18:40.787
But I fear for
the last time.

18:40.789 --> 18:43.924
Your little game
of hide and seek is over.

18:43.926 --> 18:48.195
- Very clever Mr. Tetch.
- Oh, you were the clever one.

18:48.197 --> 18:50.964
I might not have been
able to lure you here

18:50.966 --> 18:54.067
without your homing
bat transmitter

18:54.069 --> 18:55.969
in Mr. Bowinkle's hat.

18:55.971 --> 18:57.404
Holy bowler!

18:57.406 --> 18:58.939
And now, caped crusader

18:58.941 --> 19:01.708
you will take off
your cowl and hand it over.

19:01.710 --> 19:03.844
Then you will sit
for your photograph

19:03.846 --> 19:05.646
for all
the world to see.

19:05.648 --> 19:09.082
After that I'll take you on
a personally conducted tour

19:09.084 --> 19:10.917
of my hat factory.

19:10.919 --> 19:13.654
I'll have to be dead
before you get my cowl.

19:13.656 --> 19:18.258
Then, we'll start
with the hat factory.

19:18.260 --> 19:21.128
Straight ahead please.

19:26.301 --> 19:28.001
Turn on the machine, Dicer.

19:28.003 --> 19:33.874
You may find that it's smarts
a bit to be shown, Batman.

19:33.876 --> 19:35.776
Until you lose
consciousness, of course.

19:35.778 --> 19:39.146
Sorry, I'm late Jervis,
but I needed a pedicure.

19:39.148 --> 19:40.948
The girl from Antis.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.518
Up to her pretty neck in evil.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.752
You're just in time.

19:45.854 --> 19:48.088
Batman and Robin are
about to undergo a treatment

19:48.090 --> 19:52.359
I usually reserve for rabbits,
musk rats and beavers.

19:52.361 --> 19:53.660
Jervis, how droll.

19:53.662 --> 19:54.661
'Do get on with it though.'

19:54.663 --> 19:57.899
'Then perhaps you can take
me out for a bite to eat.'

19:57.901 --> 19:59.766
You heard the lady.

19:59.768 --> 20:02.669
Would you like to walk into the
factory under your own power

20:02.671 --> 20:06.740
or would you like
a shot or two to help?

20:58.027 --> 21:00.694
Put him on the conveyor belt.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.250
Batman! Help!

22:03.325 --> 22:07.460
I suppose he's passed
the acid test, Robin.

22:13.402 --> 22:17.671
That'll keep him
out mischief for a while.

22:21.076 --> 22:23.243
And what plans do
you have for me, Batman?

22:23.245 --> 22:25.478
That's up to the courts
to decide, young lady.

22:25.480 --> 22:28.415
In the meantime, help us
find those missing jurors.

22:28.417 --> 22:32.519
Whatever you say,
I'll show you where they are.

22:37.726 --> 22:39.492
I hope we're not
too late, Batman.

22:39.494 --> 22:42.529
But we had a difficult
time findin' this place.

22:42.531 --> 22:43.730
Oh, that's alright, gentlemen.

22:43.732 --> 22:46.566
I'm happy to report that
the treacherous schemes

22:46.568 --> 22:51.438
of the Mad Hatter have
been knocked completely..

22:51.440 --> 22:55.408
...into a  hat.

23:00.285 --> 23:01.850
Eighty five dollars?

23:01.852 --> 23:05.721
Oh, Bruce, it's sweet of you
to get me a birthday present.

23:05.723 --> 23:07.423
But I hat's a hat.

23:07.425 --> 23:10.359
No, Mrs. Cooper,
had is not a hat.

23:10.361 --> 23:11.827
The hat is a memory.

23:11.929 --> 23:15.130
Tea at Gladridge's,
Gaundalein, Venice?

23:15.132 --> 23:19.902
The hat is a romance,
the first time he smiled at you.

23:19.904 --> 23:22.037
The night he kissed you.

23:22.039 --> 23:24.707
The hat is an experience.

23:24.709 --> 23:26.442
Well, when you put it that way

23:26.444 --> 23:29.278
I guess $85 isn't too much.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.179
I thought you'd agree.

23:30.181 --> 23:33.916
It was so nice of you to bring
Mrs. Cooper in, Mr. Wayne.

23:33.918 --> 23:36.919
But, I'm just sorry
I'm a little shorthanded today.

23:36.921 --> 23:40.389
My favorite sale girl
disappointed me bitterly.

23:40.391 --> 23:43.859
She was mixed up with
that miserable Jervis Tetch.

23:43.861 --> 23:45.861
To put your mind
at ease, Madame Magda.

23:45.863 --> 23:48.063
I had lunch with
the city attorney today.

23:48.065 --> 23:51.366
He tells me that the Mad Hatter
won't bother you anymore

23:51.368 --> 23:53.235
he and his gang are safely
behind bars

23:53.237 --> 23:55.971
and the judge should
give them a stiff sentence.

23:55.973 --> 23:58.507
Would you put that
on my bill, please?

23:58.509 --> 24:01.477
Thank you,
Madame Magda.

24:09.854 --> 24:12.087
What's wrong, Bruce?

24:12.089 --> 24:13.021
It's funny, I..

24:13.023 --> 24:19.128
...when I came in here, I could
swear I was wearing a hat.
