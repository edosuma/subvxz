<i>McKenzie: Previously
on Face Off All-Stars...</i>

00:06.012 --> 00:07.412
Each of your teams
will be creating

00:07.447 --> 00:10.048
a beautiful snow queen inspired

00:10.083 --> 00:12.083
by a unique snow flake.

00:12.118 --> 00:13.718
- Yes!
- Whoa.

00:13.753 --> 00:15.720
<i>McKenzie: Emily and Tyler's
snow queen</i>

00:15.755 --> 00:18.189
<i>brought them their first win.</i>

00:18.225 --> 00:20.625
<i>But Cat and Niko fell short
and were the second</i>

00:20.660 --> 00:23.661
<i>All-Star team sent home.</i>

00:23.697 --> 00:25.997
<i>And in tonight's immunity
challenge,</i>

00:26.032 --> 00:29.534
<i>the artists experiment
with weird science.</i>

00:29.569 --> 00:31.102
Welcome to the laboratory.

00:31.137 --> 00:33.571
It's alive!

00:33.607 --> 00:36.407
Uh, yeah, something else
for this area.

00:36.443 --> 00:37.442
I pretty much hate the face.

00:37.477 --> 00:39.644
<i>And that's kind of terrifying.</i>

00:39.679 --> 00:41.679
Are you sure you're
making that big enough?

00:41.715 --> 00:45.617
This is most certainly
a plaster disaster.

00:45.652 --> 00:47.318
<i>McKenzie:
Find out what happens next.</i>

00:47.354 --> 00:49.687
This is Face Off All-Stars.

- Oh, cool.
- Whoa!

01:31.965 --> 01:33.398
Yeah.

01:33.433 --> 01:36.701
<i>The lab is full of body
parts, entomology bottles,</i>

01:36.736 --> 01:38.636
<i>and anthropology-style stuff,</i>

01:38.672 --> 01:40.204
and that's what I collect.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.439
I like oddities.

01:41.474 --> 01:42.941
<i>So I'm excited.</i>

01:42.976 --> 01:44.776
It's alive!

01:44.811 --> 01:46.477
This is what my room looks like.

01:46.513 --> 01:47.545
What?

01:47.580 --> 01:48.579
Hey, guys.

01:48.615 --> 01:49.814
All: Hi.

01:49.849 --> 01:51.683
Welcome to the lab.

01:51.718 --> 01:55.119
Or maybe more appropriately
for today, the laboratory.

01:55.155 --> 01:56.521
All: Yeah.

01:56.556 --> 01:58.556
Now, as a reminder,
no one will be

01:58.591 --> 02:00.591
going home this week,
and the winning team

02:00.627 --> 02:03.361
will earn immunity,
which means they're safe

02:03.396 --> 02:05.163
from elimination next week.

02:05.198 --> 02:08.466
All right, let's get
right into your challenge,

02:08.501 --> 02:10.801
which takes inspiration
from the classic tale

02:10.836 --> 02:13.571
of "Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde."

02:13.606 --> 02:16.140
<i>In films like "The Fly"
and "The Incredible Hulk,"</i>

02:16.176 --> 02:18.710
each of them features scientists

02:18.745 --> 02:20.845
engaging in exotic experiments

02:20.880 --> 02:23.247
that don't always turn out
as planned.

02:23.283 --> 02:24.782
- Nice.
- Oh.

02:24.818 --> 02:25.917
Cool.

02:25.952 --> 02:28.319
So in today's spotlight
challenge,

02:28.355 --> 02:30.154
each team will choose
one of these

02:30.190 --> 02:33.391
experiments gone wrong
and use it to inspire

02:33.426 --> 02:36.661
two makeups...
a scientist who is

02:36.696 --> 02:38.930
in mid-transformation
into a creature,

02:38.965 --> 02:41.766
and a fully transformed monster.

02:41.801 --> 02:43.801
Ooh.

02:43.837 --> 02:45.303
<i>We have to do two characters,</i>

02:45.338 --> 02:47.271
which sounds a little daunting.

02:47.307 --> 02:49.374
But hey, we're All-Stars.

02:49.409 --> 02:50.575
Okay, guys, so here is what

02:50.610 --> 02:52.210
you have to choose from.

02:52.245 --> 02:54.078
Electrical shock,

02:54.114 --> 02:56.147
horticultural hybridization,

02:56.182 --> 02:58.216
medical augmentation,

02:58.251 --> 03:00.585
insect DNA splicing,

03:00.620 --> 03:02.086
chemical exposure,

03:02.122 --> 03:04.155
and radiation exposure.

03:04.190 --> 03:05.256
Ooh.

03:05.291 --> 03:09.193
Keaghlan and Melissa,
you're up first.

03:09.229 --> 03:12.196
Ew, look at it.

03:12.232 --> 03:14.766
- Oh!
- Pass one on me.

03:22.108 --> 03:23.775
All right, go ahead
and get to work.

03:23.810 --> 03:25.476
Bye, guys.
Good luck.

03:33.787 --> 03:36.421
Let's say he had, like,
put an arm on himself,

03:36.456 --> 03:39.157
like, a big, like, beefy arm.

03:39.192 --> 03:40.992
Scientist is super
passionate about this

03:41.027 --> 03:43.361
- because he, himself...
- Is an amputee.

03:43.396 --> 03:44.695
That's exactly where I was
going with this.

03:44.731 --> 03:47.932
Yes. So Cig and I want to do
this amputee

03:47.967 --> 03:51.736
who has grown a new arm
in a test tube

03:51.771 --> 03:54.372
<i>to make it better and stronger
and faster</i>

03:54.407 --> 03:56.441
than the arm that he lost.

03:56.476 --> 03:57.875
The body rejects the marrow,

03:57.911 --> 04:01.212
but the artificially grown limb
starts to take over.

04:01.247 --> 04:02.580
Oh, I like that.

04:02.615 --> 04:05.249
Our mid-transformation character
is gonna have

04:05.285 --> 04:07.351
<i>this runaway bone growth.</i>

04:07.387 --> 04:09.053
<i>Once we get to our full monster,</i>

04:09.089 --> 04:13.057
<i>those shapes will be taking
over his whole body.</i>

04:13.093 --> 04:15.460
Oh, it feels good to flex
those creature muscles.

04:15.495 --> 04:16.594
Yeah.

04:21.968 --> 04:24.368
I think we should go
the "Silent Hill" route,

04:24.404 --> 04:26.504
as in making it fucking scary.

04:26.539 --> 04:28.539
Like, maybe, like
the electric shock

04:28.575 --> 04:29.907
gives him strength.

04:29.943 --> 04:31.209
<i>We've got electrical shock.</i>

04:31.244 --> 04:32.910
I want something scary.

04:32.946 --> 04:34.946
I want this to be an opportunity

04:34.981 --> 04:38.382
to do something that I'm not
familiar with.

04:38.418 --> 04:40.651
So the skin's coming off,
and the metal's underneath?

04:40.687 --> 04:42.587
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, gotcha.

04:42.622 --> 04:44.956
So our mid-transformation
scientist

04:44.991 --> 04:47.125
<i>has injected himself with metals</i>

04:47.160 --> 04:49.026
<i>so he can become a superhuman.</i>

04:49.062 --> 04:50.661
<i>That doesn't turn out
the way he wants.</i>

04:50.697 --> 04:55.633
<i>So our monster is a rusted-out
giant superhuman</i>

04:55.668 --> 04:58.069
<i>whose body conducts electricity,</i>

04:58.104 --> 04:59.871
and he is virtually
indestructible.

04:59.906 --> 05:00.938
That's cool.
I like that.

05:00.974 --> 05:02.406
- He's a living conductor.
- Yeah.

05:06.279 --> 05:10.414
I thought it would be cool
to do space radiation.

05:10.450 --> 05:11.849
When I think of radiation
exposure,

05:11.885 --> 05:13.317
I think of "Grindhouse."

05:13.353 --> 05:15.186
<i>So this could be a cool,
fun challenge if</i>

05:15.221 --> 05:18.022
we decide to go campy, hokey,
and in-your-face.

05:18.057 --> 05:20.291
What if he was holding...
he grabbed a meteorite

05:20.326 --> 05:22.860
and it burned through the suit.

05:22.896 --> 05:24.328
It fused into him.

05:24.364 --> 05:26.297
The mid-transformation character
has been exposed

05:26.332 --> 05:28.199
<i>to radiation
from an asteroid shard.</i>

05:28.234 --> 05:30.801
<i>Half of his body becomes
blistered and deformed</i>

05:30.837 --> 05:32.170
<i>through infection.</i>

05:32.205 --> 05:34.238
I thought it might be
interesting, like,

05:34.274 --> 05:36.073
one arm can go tentacle arm
or...

05:36.109 --> 05:37.175
Mm-hmm.

05:37.210 --> 05:38.576
The fully transformed character

05:38.611 --> 05:41.812
is an amorphous blob.

05:41.848 --> 05:45.516
<i>It's just a lump
of unhinged DNA and mutation.</i>

05:45.552 --> 05:47.218
I guess the thing we should
get out today

05:47.253 --> 05:49.887
so we can run them twice
are large blister molds.

05:49.923 --> 05:51.322
Do you want me to get you
a flat board?

05:51.357 --> 05:52.523
Sure.

05:56.362 --> 05:57.562
<i>Just in the interest of time,</i>

05:57.597 --> 05:59.263
<i>I think it's prudent
that Adam and I</i>

05:59.299 --> 06:01.098
run foam twice
with the same mold.

06:01.134 --> 06:03.834
<i>So I start making five big boil</i>

06:03.870 --> 06:05.670
<i>blender pieces on a huge
flat mold</i>

06:05.705 --> 06:09.574
<i>while Adam starts fabricating.</i>

06:09.609 --> 06:12.143
<i>We've got this giant arm
that needs to be made.</i>

06:12.178 --> 06:13.211
<i>It's gonna be a lot of work.</i>

06:13.246 --> 06:15.012
But I'm not worried.

06:15.048 --> 06:16.747
<i>If there were ever a challenge
where you go big,</i>

06:16.783 --> 06:18.049
<i>it's this one.</i>

06:18.084 --> 06:19.984
<i>As long as Adam can come
through in fabrication,</i>

06:20.019 --> 06:22.053
<i>I can sculpt most of
what I need.</i>

06:25.625 --> 06:27.091
The thing we're having
trouble pinpointing

06:27.126 --> 06:28.826
is what plant is he going to.

06:28.861 --> 06:30.461
Gage and I are
a little bit lost.

06:30.496 --> 06:33.164
<i>We want to make sure
we capture some sort of plant</i>

06:33.199 --> 06:35.433
in this monster,
because that's part of

06:35.468 --> 06:36.534
what our prompt is.

06:36.569 --> 06:38.035
Do you want to go
Venus flytraps?

06:38.071 --> 06:39.904
- Let's just go with it.
- Cool.

06:39.939 --> 06:42.039
We start talking
about carnivorous plants.

06:42.075 --> 06:44.542
<i>So Gage and I decide
that our scientist</i>

06:44.577 --> 06:48.312
<i>has spliced his genes
with a Venus flytrap</i>

06:48.348 --> 06:52.149
<i>and ends up turning into
a fully fledged monster.</i>

06:52.185 --> 06:54.952
<i>I start sculpting
the chest and the back</i>

06:54.988 --> 06:56.921
<i>while Gage is sculpting
the face.</i>

06:56.956 --> 06:59.223
Hopefully it will all
go well for us.

07:07.300 --> 07:09.767
So we end up with
insect DNA splicing,

07:09.802 --> 07:12.370
and our character
is an entomologist

07:12.405 --> 07:14.171
<i>who is trying to develop a serum</i>

07:14.207 --> 07:19.043
to create supersoldiers
utilizing bug DNA.

07:19.078 --> 07:20.611
<i>So for the mid-transformation
makeup,</i>

07:20.647 --> 07:22.713
he has injected himself,
and so he's got

07:22.749 --> 07:25.016
<i>little mandibles poking out
from his chin</i>

07:25.051 --> 07:29.387
<i>and aspects of the bug's shell
poking out.</i>

07:29.422 --> 07:32.390
<i>Our full transformed monster
is still a humanoid,</i>

07:32.425 --> 07:35.326
<i>but his internal organs liquefy</i>

07:35.361 --> 07:38.796
and then burst out of his skin.

07:38.831 --> 07:40.197
It's really gross.

07:47.106 --> 07:49.273
Sculpting, sculpting.

07:49.309 --> 07:51.409
<i>Our concept is a rogue
scientist who's inventing</i>

07:51.444 --> 07:54.278
a human growth hormone
that makes him bulk up

07:54.314 --> 07:56.747
<i>at this tremendous rate
and then eats away at his skin</i>

07:56.783 --> 08:01.085
<i>and makes his muscles collapse
and cave in.</i>

08:01.120 --> 08:02.653
<i>I start working
on the cowl piece</i>

08:02.689 --> 08:04.388
for the final transformation.

08:04.424 --> 08:06.791
<i>And Ben is working
on the giant's</i>

08:06.826 --> 08:08.326
arm and chest sculpt.

08:08.361 --> 08:10.127
I'm gonna figure out
what this collapse

08:10.163 --> 08:13.097
is gonna look like.

08:13.132 --> 08:15.499
The spin I want to put on it
is an '80s

08:15.535 --> 08:18.569
retro new wave,
a little more colorful.

08:18.604 --> 08:19.837
<i>Hopefully the judges
will appreciate</i>

08:19.872 --> 08:21.072
<i>what we're going for.</i>

08:27.013 --> 08:28.212
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

08:28.247 --> 08:29.780
I feel like Tyler on coffee.

08:29.816 --> 08:31.015
[laughs]

08:31.050 --> 08:33.083
George and I said we're
gonna do the faces first

08:33.119 --> 08:34.919
so we can get as much detail
as we can.

08:34.953 --> 08:38.688
Don't forget we're also doing an
entire creature suit, so...

08:38.725 --> 08:40.424
- Oh, I know.
- The more we add to that guy,

08:40.460 --> 08:42.360
the less we have time
to make this guy look cool.

08:42.395 --> 08:44.862
No, I think this is a somewhat
subtle makeup.

08:44.897 --> 08:46.163
Gotcha.

08:46.199 --> 08:48.466
George starts sculpting
the mid-transformation face,

08:48.501 --> 08:50.868
<i>where bone is just starting
to protrude from the skin,</i>

08:50.903 --> 08:53.437
<i>and I start sculpting
the fully transformed face.</i>

08:53.473 --> 08:55.072
<i>Bone is coming out
of everywhere.</i>

08:55.108 --> 08:56.440
<i>His skull is giant.</i>

08:56.476 --> 08:59.610
<i>Like, this guy is not
having a good day.</i>

08:59.645 --> 09:01.612
- I like it.
- You like it?

09:01.647 --> 09:03.714
Like, some of the spurs
are teeth.

09:03.750 --> 09:04.715
That's really cool.

09:08.154 --> 09:10.821
I feel like I'm building
my dream man.

09:10.857 --> 09:12.456
Our full transformation
character

09:12.492 --> 09:15.359
is gonna have
this huge body suit.

09:15.395 --> 09:20.464
So Emily and I decide to get
this entire thing done today.

09:22.101 --> 09:23.934
Like, bring this shit out.

09:23.970 --> 09:26.637
We're bulking out the shoulders
to really sell

09:26.672 --> 09:29.140
that this thing has been, like,
jacked up

09:29.175 --> 09:32.176
<i>from the exposure
of the electric shock.</i>

09:32.211 --> 09:34.745
We are banging this thing out.

09:43.689 --> 09:45.089
<i>Gage and I are rolling
right along</i>

09:45.124 --> 09:46.390
<i>with our sculptures.</i>

09:46.426 --> 09:48.759
But I take a look at what Gage
is working on,

09:48.795 --> 09:52.563
and our face is not looking
so hot.

09:52.598 --> 09:53.964
- Gage?
- Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.667
Uh, yeah, something else
for this area.

09:56.702 --> 09:59.270
<i>Gage is dropping the jaw,
which was</i>

09:59.305 --> 10:00.571
<i>completely unexpected.</i>

10:00.606 --> 10:03.207
And now I pretty much
hate the face.

10:03.242 --> 10:04.742
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

10:04.777 --> 10:07.111
I just wanted to tell you
before you got too far with it.

10:07.146 --> 10:09.146
Rachael comes up, and she says
she doesn't like it.

10:09.182 --> 10:11.148
And, you know, those are
hard words to hear.

10:11.184 --> 10:13.050
Well, I'm not done,
but when I get

10:13.085 --> 10:14.852
to a good stopping point,
I'll have you look at it

10:14.887 --> 10:16.487
and see what you think then.

10:16.522 --> 10:18.255
We need to fix this.

10:18.291 --> 10:20.925
<i>The sculpt right now
is looking almost snake-like,</i>

10:20.960 --> 10:22.593
<i>but I don't think Gage
can see it,</i>

10:22.628 --> 10:24.528
and that's kind of terrifying.

10:34.617 --> 10:36.017
What do you want to do?
Just a human nose?

10:36.053 --> 10:37.452
No.

10:37.488 --> 10:39.521
The sculpt right now
is looking snake-like.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.156
<i>We need to fix this.</i>

10:41.191 --> 10:42.724
<i>But I don't think Gage
can see it.</i>

10:42.760 --> 10:43.825
Can I?

10:43.861 --> 10:46.361
Yeah, go ahead.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.529
You want to sit behind me?

10:47.564 --> 10:48.797
Huh?
No, I'm good.

10:48.832 --> 10:50.298
<i>So I take a minute,
give my eyes a rest.</i>

10:50.334 --> 10:52.300
I just need to breathe and think
about what she's saying,

10:52.336 --> 10:54.369
because Rachael may very well
be right.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.838
I just am not seeing it.

10:56.874 --> 10:59.808
I flatten down
the nose a little bit.

10:59.843 --> 11:03.178
I think it helps make the mouth
more of a reality.

11:03.213 --> 11:04.346
What about that?

11:04.381 --> 11:06.214
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.784
I'm not really excited
by what we decide on,

11:08.819 --> 11:10.352
<i>but Gage seems to like it okay,</i>

11:10.387 --> 11:12.087
so let's just go with it.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.124
Hi, everybody.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.393
All: Hello.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.262
So what is your experiment?

11:20.297 --> 11:21.763
<i>We got chemical exposure.</i>

11:21.799 --> 11:22.864
<i>That's a good one.</i>

11:22.900 --> 11:24.332
Airbrush will really help out.

11:24.368 --> 11:27.068
Hit just very quickly,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.905
Make this flesh look like it's
even standing more out

11:29.940 --> 11:31.673
and giving that more depth
to it.

11:31.708 --> 11:32.674
Both: Yeah.

11:32.709 --> 11:35.010
We have insect DNA splicing.

11:35.045 --> 11:36.211
<i>Now, with your first stage,</i>

11:36.246 --> 11:37.479
<i>you're doing a partial face,
right?</i>

11:37.514 --> 11:39.548
- Yeah.
- Your little injection things,

11:39.583 --> 11:41.049
you know, make them read
as opposed

11:41.084 --> 11:42.851
to just being little
holes or something.

11:42.886 --> 11:43.852
Both: Yeah.

11:43.887 --> 11:45.120
Good.
Whoa.

11:45.155 --> 11:47.455
You've come a long way today.

11:47.491 --> 11:49.357
<i>The idea of the bone spurs,
I think,</i>

11:49.393 --> 11:51.459
<i>is a good idea, popping through.</i>

11:51.495 --> 11:54.029
You might do a little bit more
in here

11:54.064 --> 11:56.164
just to show that
it's coming through.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.568
'Cause this is a big jump
from here to here.

11:59.603 --> 12:00.869
- Gotcha.
- Yeah.

12:00.904 --> 12:02.204
This is your face.

12:02.239 --> 12:03.905
That's the beginning, yep.

12:03.941 --> 12:06.474
<i>We're thinking of doing
one section of the face</i>

12:06.510 --> 12:07.976
<i>be part of a cowl.</i>

12:08.011 --> 12:09.611
Right, on your face over here,

12:09.646 --> 12:12.180
take it back ten steps.

12:12.216 --> 12:15.483
So it's going to morph
into this.

12:15.519 --> 12:17.285
- Exactly.
- Good-bye, everybody!

12:17.321 --> 12:19.221
All: Bye!

12:25.295 --> 12:28.063
<i>It's about three hours
until the end of the day.</i>

12:28.098 --> 12:30.098
So we have to get this
in the mold room.

12:30.133 --> 12:31.566
I think we'll be good.

12:31.602 --> 12:33.001
Just got to make sure
it's layered,

12:33.036 --> 12:34.369
and we're good.

12:34.404 --> 12:35.871
Yes.

12:35.906 --> 12:37.873
So while the mold is setting,

12:37.908 --> 12:39.507
<i>I start blocking out forms</i>

12:39.543 --> 12:42.010
<i>for the full transformation
character's face.</i>

12:42.045 --> 12:44.112
Demetrius has
a very distinct face,

12:44.147 --> 12:45.914
<i>and I don't want to change it
too much.</i>

12:45.949 --> 12:47.315
<i>I bulk out the forehead.</i>

12:47.351 --> 12:49.517
I'm just making
a partial prosthetic.

12:49.553 --> 12:51.086
Ooh, I like that right there.

12:51.121 --> 12:52.721
Thanks.

12:52.756 --> 12:54.155
- Not too big?
- Not too big.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.690
Let's go.

12:55.726 --> 12:57.893
Oh, my God.

12:57.928 --> 12:59.494
We want our fully
transformed creature

12:59.529 --> 13:01.730
to have this large arm
with these bone shards

13:01.765 --> 13:04.432
<i>jutting out of it
that he can barely manage.</i>

13:04.468 --> 13:06.401
This thing has to be comfortable
on the model,

13:06.436 --> 13:07.869
and it has to hold up on stage.

13:07.905 --> 13:09.704
<i>So I'm making it out of buckets,</i>

13:09.740 --> 13:12.807
<i>cotton batting, and then I'm
wrapping that in foam.</i>

13:12.843 --> 13:14.876
<i>This will make it hollow,
so it'll look larger,</i>

13:14.912 --> 13:16.211
<i>but is extremely light.</i>

13:16.246 --> 13:18.613
I'm having some issues
engineering the shoulder

13:18.649 --> 13:20.682
and the bicep piece.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.851
<i>So I ultimately decide
to just scrap that.</i>

13:22.886 --> 13:25.153
'Cause I think it's better
to focus on the forearm.

13:25.188 --> 13:27.422
<i>The last giant arm
I made on the show,</i>

13:27.457 --> 13:28.790
<i>I went home for.</i>

13:28.825 --> 13:30.358
<i>So I'm here to redeem myself</i>

13:30.394 --> 13:32.093
<i>on the giant arm front.</i>

13:32.129 --> 13:34.930
Are you sure you're making
that big enough?

13:34.965 --> 13:36.431
It's the special effects
equivalent

13:36.466 --> 13:37.732
of owning a Hummer.

13:42.539 --> 13:45.473
I think I'm good.

13:45.509 --> 13:46.808
You know what I think
I'm gonna do?

13:46.843 --> 13:49.244
Since I'm not gonna
finish this today anyway,

13:49.279 --> 13:50.645
is I think I'm gonna
start on the face

13:50.681 --> 13:52.614
just so I can sculpt them
together.

13:52.649 --> 13:54.516
I put aside the cowl,
and I start

13:54.551 --> 13:57.252
to sculpt on the fully
transformed monster face,

13:57.287 --> 13:59.688
<i>and I want to do that
at the same time</i>

13:59.723 --> 14:01.823
<i>so I can make sure that they
match up evenly</i>

14:01.858 --> 14:03.892
<i>and look like they're part
of the same creature.</i>

14:03.927 --> 14:05.860
I am pulling from cockroaches
and beetles

14:05.896 --> 14:07.662
<i>with really crazy shells.</i>

14:07.698 --> 14:09.297
<i>My concern right now
is that he's reading</i>

14:09.333 --> 14:11.499
<i>a little too alien,
so I want to push</i>

14:11.535 --> 14:13.234
that bug aspect,
and I think the antenna

14:13.270 --> 14:15.637
are really gonna put me
over the edge there.

14:15.672 --> 14:17.339
What do you think about that?

14:17.374 --> 14:19.741
Cool.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.083
I start on the cowl for our
fully transformed character.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.417
<i>This is a daunting task,</i>

14:29.453 --> 14:31.219
because this is the biggest
character I've ever done

14:31.254 --> 14:32.287
on a competition.

14:32.322 --> 14:33.521
Whatcha doing, Logan?

14:33.557 --> 14:35.457
Just a clay press-out.

14:35.492 --> 14:37.225
<i>I get started
on a clay press-out</i>

14:37.260 --> 14:40.295
<i>of the mid-transformation
model's face.</i>

14:40.330 --> 14:42.330
<i>I want to show that our
character</i>

14:42.366 --> 14:45.233
<i>is transitioning into
this blobular mess.</i>

14:45.268 --> 14:46.901
<i>Just because it's gross
doesn't mean</i>

14:46.937 --> 14:48.003
it can be formless.

14:48.038 --> 14:49.471
<i>It helps me stay sane in that</i>

14:49.506 --> 14:52.741
<i>it actually has some basis
in anatomy.</i>

14:52.776 --> 14:54.776
Five minutes.

14:54.811 --> 14:55.810
Oh.

14:55.846 --> 14:58.813
<i>[rock music]</i>

14:58.849 --> 15:03.385
<i>♪ ♪</i>

15:09.493 --> 15:11.226
Yeah.

15:11.261 --> 15:12.660
As soon as we get into the lab,

15:12.696 --> 15:15.964
we start sculpting
on our monster torso.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.899
<i>We have to,
'cause there's so much to do</i>

15:17.934 --> 15:20.201
<i>and not a lot of time to do it.</i>

15:20.237 --> 15:22.937
I'm focusing on the spine
and the shoulder blades

15:22.973 --> 15:25.240
and the bones on the back
of our monster,

15:25.275 --> 15:27.275
<i>and Cig's focusing
on the ribcage</i>

15:27.310 --> 15:29.511
<i>and the sternum
and the collarbones.</i>

15:29.546 --> 15:31.212
<i>It's coming together
pretty cool.</i>

15:31.248 --> 15:33.548
I love a little abnormal
cranium growth.

15:41.391 --> 15:43.358
When this is all done,
I'll open it and clean it...

15:43.393 --> 15:44.626
Okay.

15:44.661 --> 15:46.561
So you can start sculpting
right after this.

15:46.596 --> 15:49.097
Sweet.
My happy place is sculpting.

15:49.132 --> 15:51.733
<i>So while Evan is molding,
I go straight</i>

15:51.768 --> 15:54.869
<i>into sculpting the face for our
complete transformation.</i>

15:54.905 --> 15:56.971
He's got, like,
really strong features.

15:57.007 --> 16:00.275
<i>His lips have blown up, and
some of the skin is sagging,</i>

16:00.310 --> 16:03.645
<i>signifying how his muscles
have atrophied.</i>

16:03.680 --> 16:05.413
Simultaneously, I'm sculpting

16:05.449 --> 16:07.816
<i>our mid-transformation face
to make sure</i>

16:07.851 --> 16:09.784
<i>that they both
have similar features.</i>

16:09.820 --> 16:11.419
I don't want to go
too heavy with it,

16:11.455 --> 16:14.155
but I also don't want
to go too subtle.

16:14.191 --> 16:16.157
I'm just trying to ride
that balance.

16:21.965 --> 16:24.599
<i>The mid-transformation
is coming along really well.</i>

16:24.634 --> 16:27.368
I start putting in some
boiled texture,

16:27.404 --> 16:30.205
<i>more like it's turning
as opposed to</i>

16:30.240 --> 16:31.973
just ripping out of the skin.

16:32.008 --> 16:34.175
- I like it.
- Thanks, boo.

16:34.211 --> 16:36.511
<i>I am making an aesthetic choice</i>

16:36.546 --> 16:38.146
that may not make
the most sense,

16:38.181 --> 16:40.115
but damn, it just looks cool.

16:45.655 --> 16:47.222
I'm making a bug suit.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.189
Nice.

16:48.225 --> 16:50.291
Melissa's finishing up
on our molds,

16:50.327 --> 16:53.094
<i>and I start to fabricate
our thorax.</i>

16:53.130 --> 16:55.864
<i>I make a pattern on L200</i>

16:55.899 --> 16:58.399
<i>for the armor plating
and form it</i>

16:58.435 --> 17:00.401
to our mannequin body.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.403
<i>And then I paint it based
off of a beetle</i>

17:02.439 --> 17:04.806
<i>with mahoganies and browns
and cream.</i>

17:04.840 --> 17:06.473
I'm really excited about
the direction

17:06.510 --> 17:08.175
our character is taking.

17:08.211 --> 17:09.544
Bug's in a half shell.

17:09.579 --> 17:10.744
Cockroach power.

17:14.851 --> 17:16.317
I'm gonna push this towards you.

17:16.353 --> 17:17.318
Yep.

17:17.354 --> 17:18.353
<i>It's time to open the mold,</i>

17:18.387 --> 17:20.320
and the front half
comes right off.

17:20.357 --> 17:21.556
Wow, big man.

17:21.590 --> 17:23.191
Now we just have to get the core

17:23.226 --> 17:24.692
out of the back half
of the mold.

17:24.728 --> 17:26.394
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

17:30.267 --> 17:32.167
- Mm.
- It's not budging.

17:32.202 --> 17:34.569
I'm just gonna yank it.
[grunts]

17:34.604 --> 17:36.271
I'm pulling
with everything I got.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.907
<i>George looks like a plum,
he's so red.</i>

17:38.942 --> 17:40.441
But it's still not coming out.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.143
<i>It's probably locked somewhere.</i>

17:42.179 --> 17:45.013
This is most certainly
a plaster disaster.

17:45.048 --> 17:47.215
One, two, three.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.183
Yeah.

17:48.218 --> 17:49.717
Nope, we broke.

17:49.753 --> 17:52.854
<i>This is the most important
part of our creature.</i>

17:52.889 --> 17:55.757
We have to get this mold out.

17:55.792 --> 17:57.025
There's no other option.

17:57.060 --> 17:58.459
Three...

17:58.495 --> 17:59.561
- Okay.
- Stop.

18:04.937 --> 18:07.338
One, two, three.
[grunts]

18:07.373 --> 18:08.306
Nope, we broke.

18:08.341 --> 18:09.707
<i>We have to get this mold out.</i>

18:09.743 --> 18:11.409
But it's just not budging.

18:11.444 --> 18:12.944
This stuff is here.
It's here.

18:12.979 --> 18:14.245
It's here.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.880
We realize that it is locked
in the shoulders.

18:15.915 --> 18:17.315
Start chiseling.

18:17.350 --> 18:19.517
<i>And we have no other option
but to chisel away.</i>

18:19.552 --> 18:21.385
- Evan, hit this.
- Yep, just break it.

18:21.421 --> 18:22.754
Watch your eyeballs.

18:22.789 --> 18:25.089
It's coming.
I can see it.

18:25.125 --> 18:26.958
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

18:26.993 --> 18:28.126
It's alive!

18:28.161 --> 18:30.194
Thank God it eventually
pops out.

18:30.230 --> 18:32.730
<i>But we had to chisel out
a huge chunk,</i>

18:32.766 --> 18:35.099
so the positive might not
sit correctly,

18:35.135 --> 18:36.801
<i>and it might screw up
our whole body.</i>

18:36.836 --> 18:40.404
But we got it out, and we just
got to be happy with that.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.240
Let's not do that again.
No.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.113
I feel like I'm
in heaven right now.

18:49.149 --> 18:52.116
Tyler is molding the faces,
so now,

18:52.152 --> 18:55.219
it's time to pre-paint
the suit.

18:55.255 --> 18:57.855
<i>I want to incorporate
metal parts into him</i>

18:57.891 --> 18:59.524
<i>and his skin growing over.</i>

18:59.559 --> 19:01.826
<i>So I first enhance
all the wrinkles,</i>

19:01.861 --> 19:04.495
<i>and then I paint the metal
that will be</i>

19:04.531 --> 19:07.098
<i>the rusty spots,
and then I just start</i>

19:07.133 --> 19:09.467
<i>layering it with veins
and highlights.</i>

19:09.502 --> 19:13.504
And I cannot wait to see
this character come to life.

19:13.540 --> 19:15.006
- I'm excited.
- It's awesome.

19:21.614 --> 19:23.714
We have so much to do
on application day.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.417
I want to pre-paint this whole
transformation arm now.

19:26.452 --> 19:28.653
I'm gonna
airbrush that thing today.

19:28.688 --> 19:29.821
Good.

19:29.856 --> 19:31.823
After I put a pink
spray paint coat down

19:31.858 --> 19:33.491
<i>to give it
that fleshy undertone,</i>

19:33.526 --> 19:35.960
<i>I go in with raisins
and shadower</i>

19:35.995 --> 19:37.495
<i>and bring out all the blisters.</i>

19:37.530 --> 19:40.131
And then Logan goes behind me
with a pus-y color

19:40.166 --> 19:41.199
<i>to bring out the boils.</i>

19:41.234 --> 19:43.034
It's looking pretty cool.

19:43.069 --> 19:44.569
Ten minutes, everybody.

19:50.677 --> 19:52.677
That's time, everybody.

19:52.712 --> 19:54.145
[groans]

20:02.956 --> 20:03.921
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:03.957 --> 20:05.423
Whoo!

20:08.494 --> 20:10.661
- Front looks really good.
- Oh, the back looks awesome.

20:10.697 --> 20:11.896
That just looks great.

20:11.931 --> 20:13.698
There's gonna be a lot
of application.

20:16.970 --> 20:18.102
- What's up, buddy?
- How's it going, man?

20:18.137 --> 20:19.604
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you.

20:19.639 --> 20:20.838
This is gonna be on you.

20:20.874 --> 20:22.573
<i>It's a little hectic,
because we have</i>

20:22.609 --> 20:24.942
two characters to do
in the same amount of time

20:24.978 --> 20:26.210
as we would have one.

20:26.246 --> 20:28.112
<i>So I will be applying everything</i>

20:28.147 --> 20:29.247
<i>while Emily paints.</i>

20:29.282 --> 20:31.015
Wow, that's really good.

20:31.050 --> 20:34.252
That giant body suit
fits him so well,

20:34.287 --> 20:35.786
<i>and things are going
very smoothly,</i>

20:35.822 --> 20:37.054
and it's exciting.

20:37.090 --> 20:38.456
And I'm gonna powder him,
and he's ready.

20:38.491 --> 20:39.590
All right.

20:48.067 --> 20:50.167
We're doing pretty quick
on this application, man.

20:50.203 --> 20:51.435
I know.
Don't jinx it.

20:51.471 --> 20:54.605
So I start painting
our mid-transformation character

20:54.641 --> 20:56.140
<i>to match his skin tone.</i>

20:56.175 --> 20:59.543
And I get his face
prosthetic perfectly blended.

20:59.579 --> 21:01.746
<i>It's blended so well,
that it doesn't look</i>

21:01.781 --> 21:04.315
like he has a prosthetic on,
which is a great thing.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.417
<i>But at the same time,
it's so subtle.</i>

21:06.452 --> 21:08.252
So I'm a little bit worried
about it.

21:08.288 --> 21:10.321
Dude, you can't even tell
he's wearing a prosthetic.

21:10.356 --> 21:11.689
I hope that's a good thing.

21:15.495 --> 21:17.128
I mean, we've got
two hours left.

21:17.163 --> 21:18.329
We're halfway through
application.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.363
We've done no paint.

21:19.399 --> 21:21.032
George is getting
a little worried

21:21.067 --> 21:23.167
that we're taking too long,
and there's a possibility

21:23.202 --> 21:24.535
<i>that we went too big.</i>

21:24.570 --> 21:26.504
There are so many pieces
to put down.

21:26.539 --> 21:29.674
We definitely got to get Hoyt
done before we get out of here

21:29.709 --> 21:31.409
so you just focus on Geoffrey

21:31.444 --> 21:33.477
for all of the last looks.

21:33.513 --> 21:36.280
<i>It's an insane amount
of work we have to do.</i>

21:36.316 --> 21:37.815
I don't even know how
we're gonna

21:37.850 --> 21:39.050
pull all this off.

21:39.085 --> 21:40.851
Do you want to apply
his other arm piece,

21:40.887 --> 21:42.420
and I can start painting.

21:42.455 --> 21:43.621
Yep.

21:47.060 --> 21:48.326
You keep doing that.

21:48.361 --> 21:49.694
I'm gonna jump over
and start painting him.

21:49.729 --> 21:51.329
That cool? 'Cause that's what
I'm gonna be doing.

21:51.364 --> 21:52.463
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

21:52.498 --> 21:54.632
Because we are incorporating
elements

21:54.667 --> 21:56.300
of two deadly flowers,

21:56.336 --> 21:58.669
<i>we want it to be more floral.</i>

21:58.705 --> 22:01.505
<i>So we're gonna add more purples</i>

22:01.541 --> 22:02.940
<i>and lavenders and pinks.</i>

22:02.976 --> 22:04.875
We're really trying to go
different with this one.

22:04.911 --> 22:06.444
We're getting there.
It's very purple.

22:06.479 --> 22:07.678
Yeah, I know.

22:11.918 --> 22:13.017
Hold your breath.

22:13.052 --> 22:14.652
So our mid-transformation
paint scheme

22:14.687 --> 22:18.189
is gonna be the model's skin,
which is undergoing a trauma

22:18.224 --> 22:20.257
<i>of erupting bug parts.</i>

22:20.293 --> 22:22.960
So I start by just basing out
some colors

22:22.996 --> 22:24.562
<i>that'll try and match
the model's skin,</i>

22:24.597 --> 22:26.030
<i>but it looks so flat.</i>

22:26.065 --> 22:28.099
<i>So I'm trying to bring it up
with a blue color</i>

22:28.134 --> 22:30.601
<i>to match it up with our
fully transformed monster.</i>

22:30.636 --> 22:32.903
<i>But I'm concerned, 'cause it's
reading as overpainted.</i>

22:32.939 --> 22:35.673
So I'm a little frustrated.

22:35.708 --> 22:37.641
Infected areas just look
really...

22:37.677 --> 22:39.543
they blend in too much.

22:43.983 --> 22:45.683
Turn towards me.

22:45.718 --> 22:46.851
After about three hours,

22:46.886 --> 22:48.919
I'm able to spend my time
on the paint job

22:48.955 --> 22:51.355
<i>on the complete transformation
character.</i>

22:51.391 --> 22:54.058
<i>I'm trying to balance
the flesh tones with the sores,</i>

22:54.093 --> 22:56.227
<i>so I'm using a combination
of reddish yellows,</i>

22:56.262 --> 23:00.197
some greens, and then there's
a lot of black rotting.

23:00.233 --> 23:01.966
<i>For the amount that I'm having
to cover,</i>

23:02.001 --> 23:04.068
it looks pretty good.

23:04.103 --> 23:05.369
Close your eyes.

23:09.042 --> 23:10.174
Oh, sorry.

23:10.209 --> 23:11.175
Can you put your left hand
in a...

23:11.210 --> 23:12.576
Your big hand, I'm sorry.

23:12.612 --> 23:14.912
Right here?
He's got some exposed areas.

23:14.947 --> 23:17.581
Because I nixed the shoulder
and forearm piece

23:17.617 --> 23:19.650
for our original monster,
there's a gap

23:19.685 --> 23:21.986
<i>between the forearm
and our model's arm.</i>

23:22.021 --> 23:23.954
It's something we have to
address in last looks.

23:23.990 --> 23:26.223
It's gonna be down and dirty,
but thank God

23:26.259 --> 23:28.826
we're making an abomination.

23:28.861 --> 23:30.428
30 minutes, guys!

23:38.337 --> 23:39.937
All right, guys, that's time!

23:39.972 --> 23:41.472
Okay.

23:41.507 --> 23:44.141
I tried.

23:44.177 --> 23:45.676
Boom.

23:45.711 --> 23:49.246
We need to finish painting
all the bones on the monster,

23:49.282 --> 23:51.248
the wounds around the bones,

23:51.284 --> 23:54.285
<i>and a couple adjusting things
to do with the skin tone.</i>

23:54.320 --> 23:56.220
<i>One hour is not enough time,</i>

23:56.255 --> 23:58.122
<i>but it has to be enough,
'cause if we don't</i>

23:58.157 --> 24:00.124
get it done,
we're gonna be screwed.

24:11.697 --> 24:13.498
Oh, my God.
Holy fuck.

24:13.533 --> 24:15.133
- Can you check his face?
- Yeah, I'm looking at it now.

24:15.168 --> 24:17.302
We get to last looks,
and I notice

24:17.337 --> 24:20.972
that our full transformation's
chin is just flaking off.

24:21.007 --> 24:22.707
I have to spend time
repairing that,

24:22.742 --> 24:24.976
<i>but the lighting in here
is way different than the lab.</i>

24:25.011 --> 24:27.278
I hope the color matches,
but at a point,

24:27.314 --> 24:28.579
<i>I just have to let it go.</i>

24:31.851 --> 24:33.151
- How's it going, Adam?
- Good.

24:33.186 --> 24:35.453
<i>I am wrapping the exposed areas</i>

24:35.488 --> 24:37.288
on our fully transformed
character

24:37.324 --> 24:39.891
with cotton batting
and then putting fabric

24:39.926 --> 24:41.893
that echoes the actual
space suit over it.

24:41.928 --> 24:43.161
<i>Hopefully this'll make
everything</i>

24:43.196 --> 24:46.798
look like it's been addressed
head-to-toe.

24:46.833 --> 24:49.133
We want to make sure
that every inch of him

24:49.169 --> 24:51.336
<i>is covered,
so I throw lots of goop</i>

24:51.371 --> 24:54.072
<i>and blood and gross bits
everywhere.</i>

24:54.107 --> 24:55.540
- Is it good and goopy?
- Oh, yeah.

24:55.575 --> 24:56.741
We're gonna have to
bloody that, though.

24:56.776 --> 24:57.909
Get blood.
Get blood.

24:57.944 --> 24:59.510
There's still a lot of these
bone spurs

24:59.546 --> 25:01.112
that need to have blood
around them.

25:01.147 --> 25:03.681
<i>That's usually a long process,
but not in last looks.</i>

25:03.717 --> 25:06.484
I'm slapping blood at it
just to get it done.

25:06.519 --> 25:08.119
15 minutes!

25:17.097 --> 25:19.063
It's time!

25:19.099 --> 25:22.567
The final transformation
looks kind of fake.

25:22.602 --> 25:24.869
<i>It's definitely not my favorite
makeup,</i>

25:24.904 --> 25:27.572
and I am just worried
that we didn't do enough.

25:27.607 --> 25:29.407
Ugh.
Shit.

25:39.953 --> 25:42.453
Welcome to the Face Off
reveal stage.

25:42.489 --> 25:44.956
Now, just as a reminder,
tonight's top team

25:44.991 --> 25:47.959
will win immunity and be safe
from elimination

25:47.994 --> 25:52.163
- in next week's spotlight challenge.
- Yes.

25:52.198 --> 25:54.198
All right, why don't we say
hello to our incredibly

25:54.234 --> 25:55.767
talented series judges.

25:55.802 --> 25:58.035
Owner of Alchemy Studios,
Glenn Hetrick.

25:58.071 --> 25:59.103
Good evening.

25:59.139 --> 26:00.538
All: Hey, Glenn.

26:00.573 --> 26:02.840
Oscar and Emmy award-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

26:02.876 --> 26:03.908
Hi, everyone.

26:03.943 --> 26:05.143
All: Hi, Ve.

26:05.178 --> 26:07.378
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

26:07.414 --> 26:08.379
Hello, guys.

26:08.415 --> 26:10.014
All: Hi, Neville.

26:10.049 --> 26:13.017
And as you can see,
we have a very special

26:13.052 --> 26:15.286
guest judge joining us tonight.

26:15.321 --> 26:17.855
He is a legendary writer,
producer,

26:17.891 --> 26:20.525
and director whose work
includes such classics

26:20.560 --> 26:23.528
as "Animal House,"
Michael Jackson's "Thriller,"

26:23.563 --> 26:27.031
and of course, "An American
Werewolf in London."

26:27.066 --> 26:30.935
Please give a very warm welcome
to Mr. John Landis.

26:30.970 --> 26:35.206
[cheers and applause]

26:35.241 --> 26:37.575
I love your films.

26:37.610 --> 26:40.778
John Landis is in my top three
favorite directors.

26:40.814 --> 26:42.280
I wouldn't have gone in
to special effects

26:42.315 --> 26:43.748
<i>if it hadn't been for him.</i>

26:43.783 --> 26:46.150
And now he's about
to judge my work.

26:46.186 --> 26:47.285
<i>It makes me nervous,</i>

26:47.320 --> 26:48.719
but I'm also pretty excited.

26:48.755 --> 26:49.954
Thank you.

26:49.989 --> 26:52.123
John, thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

26:52.158 --> 26:53.424
I'm very excited to be with

26:53.460 --> 26:55.560
Oscar and Emmy-winning
Ve Neill.

26:55.595 --> 26:57.528
Well, I knew her when she was
just Ve.

26:57.564 --> 26:59.030
[laughter]

26:59.065 --> 27:00.298
Like Madonna.

27:00.333 --> 27:01.599
She was running
around Rick Baker's shop.

27:01.634 --> 27:03.067
Garage is what it was.

27:03.102 --> 27:03.968
She was like that big.

27:04.003 --> 27:05.803
[laughter]

27:05.839 --> 27:07.104
John, you ready to see
some makeups?

27:07.140 --> 27:08.105
Do I have a choice?

27:08.141 --> 27:09.073
- [laughter]
- No, you don't.

27:09.108 --> 27:10.141
So yes, I am.

27:10.176 --> 27:11.709
I'm very excited.

27:11.744 --> 27:13.711
All right, let's see
what you've come up with.

27:40.540 --> 27:43.007
<i>I'm having a hard time
telling what's a sore</i>

27:43.042 --> 27:44.442
<i>and what's his natural skin,</i>

27:44.477 --> 27:46.244
<i>so I'm getting a little
concerned</i>

27:46.279 --> 27:50.147
that we're not in as good a
place as we thought

27:50.183 --> 27:51.482
we might have been.

28:18.745 --> 28:22.413
<i>It looks like a "Grindhouse"
monster you'd see</i>

28:22.448 --> 28:23.881
<i>in a low-budget movie.</i>

28:23.917 --> 28:25.616
I think Logan and I
hit our mark.

28:25.652 --> 28:27.184
I just hope the judges like it.

28:54.847 --> 28:56.113
<i>I just don't know what to think.</i>

28:56.149 --> 28:57.915
<i>Ours is one of the more
unique ones,</i>

28:57.951 --> 29:00.418
but perhaps not in the
intentional good way.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.846
<i>I love it.
I know Emily loves it.</i>

29:28.881 --> 29:30.514
So I hope we knocked it
out of the park

29:30.550 --> 29:33.718
this challenge because we're
both feeling really confident.

30:01.180 --> 30:02.647
<i>They actually look really cool.</i>

30:02.682 --> 30:04.982
<i>They look like they transformed
into one another.</i>

30:05.018 --> 30:08.753
So I'm really proud that we were
able to pull all of that off.

30:35.348 --> 30:37.415
<i>They look like they come
from the same world,</i>

30:37.450 --> 30:38.749
<i>and I love that.</i>

30:38.785 --> 30:40.718
The only thing I'm not happy
about is the paint job

30:40.753 --> 30:42.987
on the main monster.

30:48.928 --> 30:50.261
Okay, judges, go ahead and take

30:50.296 --> 30:52.730
a closer look at these
monstrous characters.

30:59.439 --> 31:01.505
Edges are really
rough up-close.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.574
I think the entire prosthetic
on his face

31:03.609 --> 31:06.444
doesn't do much.

31:06.479 --> 31:09.080
Doesn't seem like they ever
landed on an idea

31:09.115 --> 31:12.450
as to what is happening
from the exposure.

31:12.485 --> 31:14.218
Well, they covered
a lot of ground.

31:14.253 --> 31:15.519
I got to give them that.

31:15.555 --> 31:17.221
I'm trying to figure out how
the chemical

31:17.256 --> 31:21.358
from the IV forced glasses
like that.

31:24.430 --> 31:25.696
This is cool, all here.

31:25.732 --> 31:27.631
I like the fact that they
put the start

31:27.667 --> 31:28.766
of one of the claws.

31:28.801 --> 31:29.967
I like it.

31:30.002 --> 31:31.202
It kind of reminds me of someone

31:31.237 --> 31:34.605
from "Pirates of the Caribbean."

31:34.640 --> 31:36.307
I just wish this was
a crab claw,

31:36.342 --> 31:37.608
'cause I'm getting hungry.

31:37.643 --> 31:38.909
[chuckles]

31:38.945 --> 31:40.478
I like how shiny he is.

31:40.513 --> 31:42.513
It reminds me of those
"Lost in Space"

31:42.548 --> 31:43.914
Irwin Allen monsters.

31:43.950 --> 31:45.182
This looks really great,

31:45.218 --> 31:47.051
how his face is slid over.

31:47.086 --> 31:48.085
It's neat.

31:50.256 --> 31:53.557
It's unfortunate that his skin
is on top of his hair.

31:53.593 --> 31:56.560
Yeah, this transition's
really messy.

31:56.596 --> 31:58.095
I don't know why they didn't
handle that

31:58.131 --> 31:59.864
with a little bit more caution.

31:59.899 --> 32:01.398
It's definitely insect splicing,

32:01.434 --> 32:03.868
and that's evident
from our makeup.

32:03.903 --> 32:05.603
<i>But I think Keaghlan and I
overpainted,</i>

32:05.638 --> 32:06.837
<i>so I'm very concerned.</i>

32:06.873 --> 32:08.773
It looks like someone
sneezed on him.

32:08.808 --> 32:10.207
I want to win the immunity,

32:10.243 --> 32:12.643
but we're going up against
so many amazing creatures.

32:12.678 --> 32:14.378
<i>It doesn't look good for us.</i>

32:17.784 --> 32:19.617
All right, guys,
it's time to get on Twitter

32:19.652 --> 32:21.552
and tell us which team
made your favorite

32:21.587 --> 32:24.622
monstrous character
using #FaceOff

32:29.455 --> 32:31.389
This transition's really messy.

32:31.425 --> 32:33.425
<i>Even though I think
our character's overpainted,</i>

32:33.460 --> 32:35.927
<i>I'm hoping the judges will see
all the positives</i>

32:35.962 --> 32:37.495
and forgive the negatives.

32:37.531 --> 32:41.399
I actually like the bursting
through with the spines.

32:42.869 --> 32:45.136
Squish your forehead,
angry face.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.771
Oh, yeah.
Moves pretty well.

32:46.807 --> 32:48.673
The red, white, and blue
paint job,

32:48.709 --> 32:50.275
it's something you never do.

32:50.310 --> 32:51.776
It looks like a flag.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.345
I love this guy.

32:54.381 --> 32:55.947
He looks like a mad scientist.

32:55.982 --> 32:58.016
The colors are really nice
as they transition

32:58.051 --> 32:59.317
from one to another.

32:59.352 --> 33:00.852
He really looks fried.

33:00.887 --> 33:02.387
Yeah.

33:02.422 --> 33:04.556
Well, I didn't realize
this is fused.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.691
- I love that.
- It's a beautiful paint job.

33:06.727 --> 33:07.726
Gorgeous.

33:07.761 --> 33:09.394
It's so well-sculpted.

33:10.831 --> 33:11.830
I like his hair.

33:11.865 --> 33:12.897
I bet you do.

33:12.933 --> 33:14.265
[laughter]

33:14.301 --> 33:16.034
There's some interesting stuff
going on,

33:16.069 --> 33:17.736
but I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

33:17.771 --> 33:19.104
It's Halloween-y.

33:22.075 --> 33:24.242
There's something very,
very successful

33:24.277 --> 33:26.578
about the elongated
and blown-out skull.

33:26.613 --> 33:28.646
I also like the way his teeth
are kind of, like,

33:28.682 --> 33:31.883
exploding.

33:31.918 --> 33:33.585
This would've been a lot more
successful

33:33.620 --> 33:35.820
if they could've done a little
bit more hand painting.

33:35.856 --> 33:38.289
This looks like one of those
'50s mutant guys.

33:39.493 --> 33:42.227
Not so sure how all these
teeth and things

33:42.262 --> 33:44.329
plays into the horticulture.

33:44.364 --> 33:45.864
I really like it,
but I don't know

33:45.899 --> 33:47.766
if it addresses the challenge.

33:47.767 --> 33:48.767
Thank you.

33:53.373 --> 33:55.607
Okay, the judges have scored
your creations.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.909
So let's find out
what they thought.

33:57.944 --> 34:00.311
Emily and Tyler,

34:00.347 --> 34:03.748
Melissa and Keaghlan,

34:03.784 --> 34:06.484
Ben and Evan,

34:06.520 --> 34:10.054
Logan and Adam,

34:10.090 --> 34:12.023
you're the best and the worst
this week,

34:12.058 --> 34:13.625
and the judges would like
to speak with you

34:13.659 --> 34:14.659
about your work.

34:14.694 --> 34:16.127
So that means the rest of you
are safe

34:16.163 --> 34:17.795
and can head back
to the makeup room.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.270
Melissa and Keaghlan,
you're up first.

34:32.512 --> 34:33.478
Hi, guys.

34:33.513 --> 34:34.679
- Hi.
- Hello.

34:34.714 --> 34:37.047
Tell me about your back story
and how you wanted

34:37.083 --> 34:38.850
these creatures to work
with one another.

34:38.885 --> 34:41.619
Dr. Edgar Kafka
is trying to create

34:41.655 --> 34:44.389
more resilient soldiers,
so he starts

34:44.424 --> 34:47.926
isolating bug DNA,
and he creates a serum,

34:47.960 --> 34:49.928
and he tries it on himself.

34:49.963 --> 34:52.664
The color palette
is very problematic for me.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.799
Okay.

34:54.835 --> 34:56.601
Why did you choose those colors?

34:56.636 --> 34:57.769
There was a reference
that I found

34:57.804 --> 35:00.505
of a beetle that was brown,
black, and blue.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.707
When you find a piece
of reference,

35:02.742 --> 35:05.643
don't follow it so specifically
that it doesn't

35:05.679 --> 35:08.179
suit your needs
for the makeup overall.

35:08.215 --> 35:09.881
Okay, all right.

35:09.916 --> 35:11.950
From a distance,
there is no focus

35:11.985 --> 35:13.852
on your full transformation
character.

35:13.887 --> 35:16.454
You put so much color,
you don't really

35:16.489 --> 35:17.455
see the makeup.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.923
It's just a little too muddy.

35:18.959 --> 35:20.024
Okay.

35:20.060 --> 35:22.727
I personally like the fact
you used

35:22.762 --> 35:25.163
that turquoise color,
especially coming

35:25.198 --> 35:27.498
out of his cheek like that,
looks amazing.

35:27.534 --> 35:29.267
Thank you.

35:29.302 --> 35:31.569
Melissa and Keaghlan,
please step back.

35:31.605 --> 35:32.737
Thank you.

35:37.878 --> 35:39.744
Emily and Tyler, please step up.

35:46.887 --> 35:47.919
Hi, Emily and Tyler.

35:47.954 --> 35:48.987
- Hello.
- Hey.

35:49.022 --> 35:50.455
Would you please tell us
about your

35:50.490 --> 35:52.824
electrical shock transformation
characters?

35:52.859 --> 35:54.292
So our scientist is
experimenting

35:54.327 --> 35:56.294
with electroshock therapy,
so he becomes, like,

35:56.329 --> 35:58.363
a organic conductor
of electricity.

35:58.398 --> 36:01.633
- You did a really great job.
- Thank you.

36:01.668 --> 36:04.369
The transformation between
the two of these characters

36:04.404 --> 36:06.137
is so beautifully handled.

36:06.172 --> 36:08.973
I love the color palette,
and your full

36:09.009 --> 36:11.209
transformation guy looks
spectacular.

36:11.244 --> 36:12.677
Both: Thank you.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.545
It's such a subtle design.

36:14.581 --> 36:20.318
However, you handled it so well
in both sculpture and paint

36:20.353 --> 36:22.086
that it doesn't matter.

36:22.122 --> 36:23.688
Both: Thank you.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.357
One of the things
I reacted to right away

36:26.393 --> 36:28.393
is the overall unity of it.

36:28.428 --> 36:29.928
It's beautifully painted.

36:29.963 --> 36:32.830
This works at a distance
and close up.

36:32.866 --> 36:35.833
As a filmmaker,
that's, like, great.

36:35.869 --> 36:37.535
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.103
Emily and Tyler,
please step back.

36:39.139 --> 36:40.772
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

36:44.277 --> 36:45.810
- Good job.
- Good job.

36:45.845 --> 36:47.378
Evan and Ben.

36:52.485 --> 36:54.152
- Hey, Ben, Evan.
- Hello.

36:54.187 --> 36:57.055
So tell us about your chemical
exposure transformation.

36:57.090 --> 37:00.024
Our doctor here was developing
a serum

37:00.060 --> 37:01.793
to increase muscle growth.

37:01.828 --> 37:05.396
The result was his muscles
expanded way too fast

37:05.432 --> 37:08.066
and created these sores
all around him.

37:08.101 --> 37:11.035
The overall paint job
is not selling it.

37:11.071 --> 37:12.670
Yeah.

37:12.706 --> 37:14.138
Aaron's got an incredible
physique,

37:14.174 --> 37:16.941
and sculpting an additional pec
and deltoid

37:16.977 --> 37:20.611
and hiding his doesn't show
the physical mass change.

37:20.647 --> 37:23.848
And the head on your final
transformation

37:23.883 --> 37:27.185
- feels a little clunky.
- Okay.

37:27.220 --> 37:30.154
The uninspired nebulous forms
don't convey

37:30.190 --> 37:31.656
what it is you were
trying to say.

37:31.691 --> 37:34.993
It's begging for some big
semitranslucent

37:35.028 --> 37:38.596
boils and bubbles and stuff
around the edges.

37:38.631 --> 37:41.099
The coloration on this makeup
is really lacking,

37:41.134 --> 37:42.934
especially in the facial area.

37:42.969 --> 37:47.238
You've got a lot of problems.

37:47.273 --> 37:49.407
Evan and Ben, please step back.

37:49.442 --> 37:50.274
Thank you, guys.

37:56.049 --> 37:58.449
Logan and Adam,
please step forward.

38:04.057 --> 38:05.223
Hi, Adam and Logan.

38:05.258 --> 38:06.224
- Hi.
- Hello.

38:06.259 --> 38:07.792
Tell me about your concept.

38:07.827 --> 38:11.462
This is an astronaut scientist
on the moon station Brometheus.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.765
They think they're protected,
but it's space radiation,

38:13.800 --> 38:16.667
so it not only burns you
and gives you boils,

38:16.703 --> 38:19.003
but it's also deconstructing
their DNA

38:19.039 --> 38:21.105
into God-knows-what.

38:21.141 --> 38:24.208
Well, I really like this.

38:24.244 --> 38:26.110
I like the before better

38:26.146 --> 38:27.979
because it's more subtle.

38:28.014 --> 38:31.282
His monster claw
is a little too big for me.

38:31.317 --> 38:33.151
But I actually think
he's creepy,

38:33.186 --> 38:34.685
and I think it's great.

38:34.721 --> 38:36.020
Both: Thank you.

38:36.056 --> 38:38.623
I definitely like the way
that you've decided

38:38.658 --> 38:42.493
to go in your own
very unique direction.

38:42.529 --> 38:45.963
The oversized asymmetry
feels very contemporary.

38:45.999 --> 38:49.467
And I'm amazed that you got
the level of detail.

38:49.502 --> 38:51.069
Both: Thank you.

38:51.104 --> 38:53.137
I think one of the smartest
decisions that you made

38:53.173 --> 38:56.140
is to be specific about a genre

38:56.176 --> 38:58.176
that is tongue-in-cheek.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.644
Because of that, it gives you

38:59.679 --> 39:02.847
this tremendous latitude
to push the envelope.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.615
I think it's great.

39:04.651 --> 39:06.884
Logan and Adam,
please step back.

39:06.920 --> 39:07.985
Both: Thanks.

39:12.158 --> 39:13.424
All right, thank you, guys.

39:13.460 --> 39:14.725
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

39:14.761 --> 39:16.327
while the judges deliberate.

39:16.362 --> 39:17.695
- Thanks.
- Thank you, guys.

39:22.669 --> 39:23.634
All right, judges,

39:23.670 --> 39:25.336
let's talk about
your favorites tonight.

39:25.371 --> 39:27.505
How about Emily and Tyler?

39:27.540 --> 39:29.040
I love the way that they allowed

39:29.075 --> 39:30.608
the conceptual approach
to drive their

39:30.643 --> 39:32.543
decision-making
with all the colors.

39:32.579 --> 39:35.379
The colors, obviously,
were the success of this makeup.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.081
It was blended.
It was beautiful.

39:37.117 --> 39:38.983
They looked like they stepped
out of a painting.

39:39.018 --> 39:42.987
There was a tremendous amount
of expert form in the body.

39:43.022 --> 39:45.289
That chest piece
was so well-crafted.

39:45.325 --> 39:47.058
The first guy never
broke character,

39:47.093 --> 39:48.759
and he was doing
a real Dwight Frye.

39:48.795 --> 39:50.561
I thought the work
was excellent.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.697
All right, let's move on
to Logan and Adam.

39:52.732 --> 39:55.967
It was very creative
and very reminiscent of anime.

39:56.002 --> 39:58.069
I love that.
That makes it feel kinetic.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.537
Lots of great decision-making

39:59.572 --> 40:02.306
and massive amount of work
from this team this week.

40:02.342 --> 40:03.774
I love the fact that they
hid the face

40:03.810 --> 40:05.076
in the side of the head there.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.011
Just a little nice surprise
when you get up close.

40:07.046 --> 40:08.045
That's great.

40:08.081 --> 40:10.515
That second guy looked
like Irwin Allen

40:10.550 --> 40:11.816
in "Lost in Space."

40:11.851 --> 40:13.117
But better done.

40:13.153 --> 40:14.385
I really liked it.

40:14.420 --> 40:15.820
Let's move on to the looks

40:15.855 --> 40:17.755
that didn't come together
this week.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.524
Why don't we start
with Melissa and Keaghlan?

40:19.559 --> 40:23.361
It was a decent design,
but it was buried in disorder.

40:23.396 --> 40:24.595
It was a huge letdown.

40:24.631 --> 40:26.464
They needed to create
some translucency

40:26.499 --> 40:28.132
so it felt like bug shells.

40:28.168 --> 40:30.234
From a distance,
it was just brown and muddy.

40:30.270 --> 40:32.336
And you see these bright
blue and white stripes.

40:32.372 --> 40:34.272
There was just no place
to focus on.

40:34.307 --> 40:35.540
I totally agree with you.

40:35.575 --> 40:38.142
But I like that turquoise
coming through his skin,

40:38.178 --> 40:40.111
and I like carrying it through
the insect.

40:40.146 --> 40:42.113
All right, let's move on
to Ben and Evan.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.814
The paint job was atrocious.

40:43.850 --> 40:44.949
It was flat.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.951
There was no translucency
to the skin.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.787
I don't think that they
ever honed in on their concept.

40:49.822 --> 40:52.056
Both of these guys
are extraordinarily talented.

40:52.091 --> 40:53.858
That was a pathetic showing.

40:53.893 --> 40:56.594
It lacked any sense
of kinetic transformation.

40:56.629 --> 40:58.963
That's what drove me crazy
was the first guy.

40:58.998 --> 41:00.064
He was, like, built.

41:00.099 --> 41:01.966
But then the big guy wasn't big.

41:02.001 --> 41:02.967
It was weird.

41:03.002 --> 41:03.968
All right, judges,

41:04.003 --> 41:05.503
have you chosen tonight's
winner?

41:05.538 --> 41:06.871
Yeah.

41:06.906 --> 41:08.105
Let's bring them back out.

41:11.878 --> 41:13.744
Welcome back, guys.

41:13.780 --> 41:16.113
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top teams.

41:16.149 --> 41:18.749
Emily and Tyler,
the super conductor concept

41:18.785 --> 41:21.352
was a great conduit
for your character.

41:21.387 --> 41:23.120
We also thought that you used
your color

41:23.156 --> 41:24.455
beautifully throughout.

41:24.490 --> 41:27.792
Logan and Adam, we appreciate
the humorous approach

41:27.827 --> 41:29.860
that you took this week,
and there was some really

41:29.896 --> 41:32.797
nice highlights and shadows
in your paint job.

41:32.832 --> 41:34.665
Okay, which team
came out on top?

41:34.701 --> 41:36.267
The winning team is...

41:42.308 --> 41:43.808
<i>McKenzie: The winner
of Face Off All-Stars</i>

41:43.843 --> 41:46.711
<i>will receive a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up</i>

41:46.746 --> 41:49.146
<i>to one of their 85
international locations,</i>

41:49.182 --> 41:51.983
<i>a brand-new
Hyundai Veloster,</i>

41:52.018 --> 41:53.951
<i>and $100,000.</i>

41:59.918 --> 42:01.318
Okay, which team
came out on top?

42:01.353 --> 42:03.086
The winning team is...

42:06.826 --> 42:08.158
Emily and Tyler.

42:08.194 --> 42:11.195
[clapping]

42:13.699 --> 42:15.532
You guys made really smart
choices in terms

42:15.568 --> 42:17.134
of your time management,
and that

42:17.169 --> 42:20.137
enabled you to show us
a clean, beautiful makeup.

42:20.172 --> 42:22.306
Keep up the good work, guys.

42:22.341 --> 42:23.774
Both: Thank you.

42:23.809 --> 42:25.209
We won!

42:25.244 --> 42:28.212
- Again!
- I am so happy.

42:28.247 --> 42:30.781
This makeup is not
what I typically do,

42:30.816 --> 42:33.584
and so to win this one
and win immunity,

42:33.619 --> 42:35.519
<i>I feel like we're in
a really good place.</i>

42:35.554 --> 42:36.887
We're on a roll.

42:36.922 --> 42:39.456
Emily and Tyler,
congratulations.

42:39.492 --> 42:41.525
As the winners
of tonight's challenge,

42:41.560 --> 42:44.194
your team has won immunity
in next week's

42:44.230 --> 42:45.863
spotlight challenge.

42:45.898 --> 42:47.798
Great work this week, everyone.

42:47.833 --> 42:50.367
And John, thank you again
for joining us.

42:50.402 --> 42:52.202
Thank you for having me.

42:52.238 --> 42:55.272
[applause]

42:55.307 --> 42:56.707
All right, guys,
why don't you all

42:56.742 --> 42:59.943
go home and get some rest,
because you're going to need it.

42:59.979 --> 43:01.044
Good night.
See you soon.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.813
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

43:02.848 --> 43:04.348
Our bottom looks
have been rock bottom,

43:04.383 --> 43:05.716
<i>so that's scary.</i>

43:05.751 --> 43:08.778
But we know that there's
nowhere else to go but up.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.427
Hopefully.
