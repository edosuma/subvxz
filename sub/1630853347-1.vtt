WEBVTT

01:03.313 --> 01:04.147
Did that kill it?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.065
No.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.147
That's how we kill it.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.155
The book of vishanti!

01:15.868 --> 01:18.120
We can't let it take your power.
Get to the book.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.288
How do we get across?

01:19.454 --> 01:20.454
Jump.

01:23.876 --> 01:24.876
Hold on!

01:26.920 --> 01:29.047
No, no, no!

02:08.961 --> 02:10.464
It's too strong.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.257
I can't hold it.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.451
I'm so sorry.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.286
This is the only way.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.457
What're you doing?

02:45.624 --> 02:47.543
I can't let that thing take your power.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.586
You can't control it.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.130
But I can.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.966
But we're friends.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.426
You're killing me.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.678
I know.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.723
But in the grand calculus
of the multiverse...

03:01.890 --> 03:03.851
Your sacrifice is worth more than your...

04:28.393 --> 04:30.187
Excuse me. May I?

04:30.354 --> 04:31.355
Thanks.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.960
Doctor strange.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.294
Doctor west.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.256
Haven't seen you in a while.

04:57.422 --> 05:01.468
Yeah, I was a little preoccupied
being dust there for five years, so...

05:01.635 --> 05:03.136
So were a lot of us.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.516
While I was gone...

05:08.308 --> 05:09.852
Thank you for asking...

05:10.894 --> 05:12.688
I lost both my cats...

05:15.941 --> 05:17.276
And my brother.

05:20.529 --> 05:21.989
I'm very sorry.

05:23.282 --> 05:24.283
Thank you.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.958
I guess what keeps me up at night
is wondering...

05:33.750 --> 05:35.711
Did it have to happen that way?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.798
Was there any other path?

05:43.427 --> 05:44.678
No.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.682
No, I made the only play we had.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.809
Well, of course you did.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.563
The best surgeon and the best superhero.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.819
But you still didn't get the girl.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.245
Glass of red, please.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.412
Oh, allow me, miss.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.416
Little too on the nose?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.252
What? For you, at my wedding?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.045
Nah. I think it was perfect.

07:00.796 --> 07:01.922
Congratulations.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.215
Thank you.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.217
There's Charlie.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.594
I have to introduce you
because he's kind of...

07:07.761 --> 07:10.848
It's embarrassing,
but he's a big fan, so...

07:11.014 --> 07:12.057
Hey, Christine.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.060
I should've...

07:17.938 --> 07:19.178
I wish I'd have been different.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.234
I never stopped caring about us.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.486
But I had to make sacrifices...

07:25.279 --> 07:26.780
To protect you.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.490
I'm sorry.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.997
It was never gonna work out between us.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.625
Why not?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.669
Because, Stephen...

07:40.836 --> 07:43.130
You have to be the one holding the knife.

07:43.881 --> 07:47.259
And I always respected you for it,
but I couldn't love you for it.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.906
How long you had that one in the barrel?

07:56.268 --> 07:57.311
Long time.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.396
Yeah. I bet.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.564
Look...

08:02.232 --> 08:04.818
Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.030
I am.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.282
I really, really am.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.825
Good.

08:12.910 --> 08:13.911
Are you?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.871
I'm happy.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.456
Good.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.249
You deserve it.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.886
Oh, man. Look out! What is that?

08:32.596 --> 08:33.889
Dude!

08:41.563 --> 08:42.563
Thank you.

09:22.604 --> 09:23.604
Wow!

09:30.362 --> 09:31.405
No, no.

09:45.294 --> 09:46.295
Look out!

09:57.306 --> 09:58.307
Do I know you?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.452
Help!

11:49.168 --> 11:50.169
You're welcome.

11:50.878 --> 11:54.131
You know it's ancient custom to bow
in the presence of the sorcerer supreme?

11:54.298 --> 11:56.341
Yeah, I'm aware of the customs.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.556
Hold it, hold it!

12:30.209 --> 12:31.376
That's incredible.

12:31.752 --> 12:32.794
Yeah.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.176
Oh, god!

13:34.815 --> 13:35.816
Who's this?

13:35.983 --> 13:37.252
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

13:37.276 --> 13:38.610
Hey, kid.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.255
What did that creature want with you?

13:40.279 --> 13:41.280
Where're your parents?

13:41.446 --> 13:42.614
We'll take her back to the...

13:46.076 --> 13:47.077
She took my slingie.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.037
She took your slingie.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.210
Yeah, it was crazy, man.

13:55.752 --> 13:56.920
Oh, my god!

13:58.422 --> 14:00.299
I'm not gonna kill you, kid.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.885
I just bust my ass trying to
save your life, remember?

14:05.470 --> 14:07.347
Giant monsters I can clearly handle...

14:07.514 --> 14:10.767
But what bothers me is that last night,
you were in my dream.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.396
That wasn't a dream.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.440
It was another universe.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.737
How much experience do you guys have
with the multiverse?

14:22.404 --> 14:23.884
We have experience of the multiverse.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.033
Most recently, there was an incident
with spider-man.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.451
What man?

14:27.618 --> 14:30.412
- Spider-man. He has the powers of a spider.
- Hence the name.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.830
Gross.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.077
Does he look like a spider?

14:33.165 --> 14:34.165
No. No, more like a man.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.334
Climbs walls, shoots webs.

14:35.501 --> 14:36.781
- Yeah. Bingo.
- Out of his butt?

14:36.919 --> 14:38.170
- No.
- No.

14:38.337 --> 14:39.671
Well, maybe, I don't know.

14:39.838 --> 14:40.839
Honestly, I hope not.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.049
Super weird.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.135
You're gonna get a stomach ache.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.845
I'm from another universe.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.823
How do you know my stomach
works the same as yours?

14:48.847 --> 14:50.015
I don't.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.392
I don't even know
if you're from another universe...

14:52.559 --> 14:55.604
Which is why I'm still sitting here,
waiting for you to enlighten us.

14:55.854 --> 14:56.854
Gotta say,

14:57.439 --> 14:59.239
of the two doctor
stranges I've met so far...

14:59.733 --> 15:00.733
You're not my favorite.

15:01.443 --> 15:02.443
Which means?

15:03.612 --> 15:04.988
Does he not know Spanish?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.908
I'm not sure he even
enjoys speaking English.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.494
Look, I left a very nice wedding...

15:10.661 --> 15:13.413
To save a smart-ass kid
from getting eaten by an octopus.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.141
- Whose wedding?
- Now tell me... Christine's.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.935
- You went?
- Holy shit, you married Christine?

15:16.959 --> 15:17.793
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I do.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.960
No, I didn't. Yes.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.505
You need to explain to me what's going on.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.757
Why was that octopus trying to eat you?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.676
That thing was trying to kidnap me.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.179
It's like a henchman who works for a demon.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.015
All we knew is that they wanted
to take my power for themselves.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.350
What power?

15:34.935 --> 15:36.395
I can travel the multiverse.

15:36.979 --> 15:37.980
What?

15:38.146 --> 15:40.357
You can physically move
from one universe to another?

15:40.941 --> 15:41.775
How?

15:41.859 --> 15:43.652
That's the problem. I don't know how.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.070
Can't control it.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.239
Only happens when I'm really,
really afraid.

15:47.948 --> 15:51.535
Okay. And did other me know
how to defeat this demon?

15:51.702 --> 15:54.663
Well, you guys knew of
this magical book of pure good...

15:54.830 --> 15:57.875
That gives a sorcerer whatever they need
to defeat their enemy.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.085
The book of vishanti?

16:00.544 --> 16:01.670
It's not real.

16:01.837 --> 16:04.131
It's a fairy tale. It doesn't exist.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.299
Actually, it does.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.070
I found out in the secret book you get
when you become sorcerer supreme.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.137
Unbelievable.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.597
You're not the sorcerer supreme?

16:11.763 --> 16:13.515
No, I'm not the sorcerer supreme.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.522
Other you was sorcerer supreme
of his universe.

16:15.559 --> 16:16.435
Right. Yeah.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.103
Although it does exist...

16:18.270 --> 16:20.314
The book of vishanti
is said to be unreachable.

16:21.607 --> 16:22.941
It is. Except...

16:24.109 --> 16:25.110
We reached it.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.864
Then the demon caught up with us.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.700
I thought you'd protect me...

16:34.578 --> 16:35.578
But you didn't.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.164
That was the fight in my dream.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.083
That wasn't a dream.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.127
Prove it.

16:50.594 --> 16:51.970
It wasn't a dream.

16:59.228 --> 17:00.479
That means...

17:02.272 --> 17:05.067
Dreams are windows into the lives
of our multiversal selves.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.904
That was his theory.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.949
So, that recurring nightmare
where I'm running naked from a clown...

17:12.699 --> 17:14.576
Somewhere out there, it's real.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.496
Somewhere out there I had a ponytail.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.165
There could be more creatures
coming for her.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.502
The power is dangerous enough
in the hands of a kid.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.148
Imagine if a real threat acquired it?

17:27.589 --> 17:30.050
It occurs to me, young one,
we don't know your name.

17:33.512 --> 17:34.680
America Chavez.

17:34.847 --> 17:38.058
Miss Chavez, will you come with us
to kamar-taj?

17:38.225 --> 17:39.434
You'll be safe there.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.312
How do I know you won't betray me
like he did?

17:43.438 --> 17:45.440
I guess you're just gonna have to trust me.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.737
What do we do with him?

17:59.496 --> 18:00.956
That's gotta violate an ordinance.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.583
Ah, I've buried worse.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.742
The creature that killed him...

18:07.796 --> 18:09.798
Did it have the same
markings as the octopus?

18:09.965 --> 18:11.008
Runes.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.302
This isn't sorcery.

18:14.636 --> 18:15.637
It's witchcraft.

18:16.889 --> 18:18.640
Do we know anyone who's faced such a thing?

18:21.852 --> 18:22.978
I think I might.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.356
Chocolate!

18:26.481 --> 18:27.983
Hey! What did I say?

18:28.150 --> 18:29.193
But we couldn't wait.

18:29.359 --> 18:30.611
But what did I say?

18:34.239 --> 18:36.116
Go wash your hands.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.915
Mom, come on. We're too old for that.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.250
Oh, okay.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.502
You can tuck me in, mom.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.337
I will.

18:51.673 --> 18:55.385
You know, a family is forever.

18:56.261 --> 18:59.389
We could never truly leave each other,
even if we tried.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.475
Mom, I changed my mind.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.727
You can come tuck me in if you want.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.062
Okay.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.275
Love you.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.641
Apples, right?

19:43.976 --> 19:45.227
Eventually.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.402
- Smells...
- Sweet.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.529
I was gonna say real.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.198
It's all very real, thanks.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.159
I've put the magic behind me.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.536
So I can see.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.789
Well,
I knew sooner or later you'd show up...

20:05.956 --> 20:07.958
Wanting to discuss what
happened at westview.

20:09.877 --> 20:12.754
I made mistakes, and people were hurt...

20:12.921 --> 20:16.675
But you put things right in the end,
and that was never in doubt.

20:16.842 --> 20:19.720
I'm not here to talk about westview.

20:19.887 --> 20:20.967
Then what are you here for?

20:21.054 --> 20:22.264
We need your help.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.310
With what?

20:26.476 --> 20:28.478
What do you know about the multiverse?

20:28.645 --> 20:30.272
The multiverse.

20:30.439 --> 20:31.440
Vis had his theories.

20:31.607 --> 20:35.611
He believed it was real, and dangerous.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.279
Well, he was right about both.

20:37.946 --> 20:40.574
We found a girl
who can somehow travel across it...

20:40.741 --> 20:42.242
But she's being pursued.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.952
- Pursued by who?
- Some kind of demon.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.079
One that covets her power for itself.

20:46.747 --> 20:50.501
We've taken her to kamar-taj,
and we've got our defenses...

20:50.667 --> 20:52.419
But we could use an avenger.

20:52.586 --> 20:54.296
There are other avengers.

20:54.463 --> 20:56.983
Yeah, but given the choice between
the Archer with the mohawk...

20:57.132 --> 20:59.259
And several bug-themed crime fighters...

20:59.426 --> 21:04.348
Or one of the most powerful magic-wielders
on the planet...

21:04.515 --> 21:05.849
It's an easy call.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.101
Come to kamar-taj.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.480
It'll get you back on the lunch box.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.610
What if you brought america here?

21:17.694 --> 21:18.695
Here?

21:19.279 --> 21:22.032
Yeah. I know what it's like
to be on your own...

21:22.199 --> 21:24.785
Hunted for abilities you never wanted...

21:25.744 --> 21:27.412
And I can protect her.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.754
- You never told me her name, did you?
- No.

21:37.548 --> 21:38.757
No, I didn't.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.597
You know, the hex was the easy part.

21:46.390 --> 21:49.309
The lying, not so much.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.421
The darkhold.

22:17.588 --> 22:18.964
You're familiar with the darkhold?

22:19.131 --> 22:20.966
I know it's the book of the damned...

22:21.133 --> 22:24.553
And that it corrupts everything
and everyone that it touches.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.388
I wonder what it's done to you.

22:26.555 --> 22:28.932
The darkhold only showed me the truth.

22:29.099 --> 22:32.728
Everything I lost can be mine again.

22:32.895 --> 22:34.438
What do you want with america?

22:34.605 --> 22:36.481
What do you want with the multiverse?

22:36.648 --> 22:38.942
I'm going to leave this reality...

22:39.693 --> 22:42.154
And go to one where I can be
with my children.

22:42.321 --> 22:44.615
Wanda, your children aren't real.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.825
You created them using magic.

22:46.992 --> 22:48.619
That's what every mother does.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.165
If you knew...

22:53.749 --> 22:56.168
There was a universe...

22:56.335 --> 22:58.045
Where you were happy...

22:58.212 --> 23:00.172
Wouldn't you want to go there?

23:00.631 --> 23:02.174
I am happy.

23:02.341 --> 23:05.093
I know better than most
what self-deception looks like.

23:06.470 --> 23:09.389
What you're doing is a flagrant violation
of every natural law...

23:09.556 --> 23:12.434
And if you take that child's power,
she won't survive.

23:12.601 --> 23:14.728
I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.064
But she's not a child.

23:17.231 --> 23:19.399
She's a supernatural being.

23:19.566 --> 23:23.445
Such raw power could wreak havoc on this
and other worlds.

23:23.612 --> 23:25.030
Her sacrifice...

23:26.031 --> 23:27.241
Would be for the greater good.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.047
Well, you can kiss the lunch box goodbye,

23:29.076 --> 23:31.703
'cause that's the kind of justification
our enemies use.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.372
Is it the one you used...

23:34.081 --> 23:36.458
When you gave Thanos the time stone?

23:39.920 --> 23:43.632
That was a war, and I did what I had to do.

23:43.799 --> 23:46.093
You break the rules and become a hero.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.178
I do it, and I become the enemy.

23:49.513 --> 23:51.139
That doesn't seem fair.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.184
What happens now?

23:54.351 --> 23:55.936
Return to kamar-taj...

23:56.103 --> 23:59.231
And prepare to hand over america Chavez
by sundown.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.567
Peacefully.

24:02.776 --> 24:03.986
After that...

24:06.029 --> 24:08.448
You'll never see me again.

24:12.244 --> 24:14.413
And if we don't?

24:18.250 --> 24:20.294
Then it won't be Wanda who comes for her.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.797
It will be the Scarlet witch.

24:34.308 --> 24:35.934
The Scarlet witch.

24:38.979 --> 24:40.731
Wanda's gone.

24:40.898 --> 24:43.567
She's got the darkhold,
and the darkhold has her.

24:47.237 --> 24:50.324
The Scarlet witch is
a being of unfathomable magic.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.702
She can rewrite reality as she chooses...

24:55.204 --> 24:57.664
And is prophesized to either rule...

24:57.831 --> 24:59.833
Or annihilate the cosmos.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.170
She took over a whole town using her mind.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.132
If she gets america's power...

25:07.299 --> 25:09.635
She could enslave the entire multiverse.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.389
So, the person you went to ask for help...

25:14.556 --> 25:16.767
And told exactly where I am...

25:16.934 --> 25:18.494
Is the person that's trying to kill me?

25:19.811 --> 25:20.854
Yeah.

25:21.563 --> 25:25.150
Suspend teaching at once
and arm the students.

25:25.317 --> 25:27.861
Kamar-taj must now become a fortress.

26:03.063 --> 26:04.189
Wow.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.859
It's the masters of the Hong Kong
and London sanctums.

26:07.734 --> 26:11.113
It's an honor to court death
alongside you once again.

26:11.488 --> 26:12.488
The honor is ours.

26:12.614 --> 26:16.535
Whatever the sorcerer supreme asks of us,
it shall be done.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.704
Extra duty men, follow me.

26:19.121 --> 26:20.914
It's ancient custom.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.687
Choose your words wisely.

27:25.854 --> 27:28.148
The fate of the multiverse
may depend on it.

27:28.315 --> 27:29.358
Got it.

27:30.609 --> 27:32.069
No pressure, then.

27:45.249 --> 27:48.293
All this for a child you met yesterday.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.296
Wanda, you are justifiably angry.

27:51.463 --> 27:53.298
You had to make terrible sacrifices.

27:53.465 --> 27:56.176
I blew a hole through the head
of the man I loved...

27:57.511 --> 28:00.347
And it meant nothing.

28:00.514 --> 28:04.476
Do not speak to me of sacrifice,
Stephen strange.

28:12.484 --> 28:15.529
If you give me what I want...

28:15.696 --> 28:18.365
I'll send you to a world
where you can be with Christine.

28:20.534 --> 28:24.246
The full might of kamar-taj
stands against you.

28:25.122 --> 28:28.166
Defensive positions, now!

28:34.756 --> 28:36.967
Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.

28:37.134 --> 28:40.762
You have no idea
just how reasonable I have been.

28:40.929 --> 28:41.763
Yeah.

28:41.930 --> 28:45.118
Book of the damned, calling yourself a
witch, conjuring creatures to abduct a kid...

28:45.142 --> 28:47.394
I don't exactly call that being reasonable.

28:47.561 --> 28:52.399
Sending those creatures after her
instead of myself was mercy.

28:52.566 --> 28:56.486
And in spite of your hypocrisies,
and insults...

28:56.653 --> 29:00.741
I have begged you to
safely get out of my way.

29:02.075 --> 29:04.203
You have exhausted my Patience...

29:05.829 --> 29:09.791
But I do hope you
understand that even now...

29:09.958 --> 29:11.502
What's about to happen...

29:12.878 --> 29:14.546
This is me...

29:14.713 --> 29:17.382
Being reasonable.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.644
Hold!

29:30.103 --> 29:31.897
Hold!

29:46.370 --> 29:47.829
Nailed it.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.252
Reinforce the shield.

29:53.418 --> 29:54.419
Reinforce the shield!

29:54.586 --> 29:56.421
Reinforce the shield!

30:16.608 --> 30:18.026
She's trying to get in their heads.

30:18.485 --> 30:21.405
Sorcerers, fortify your mind!

30:33.834 --> 30:35.544
Run.

30:58.442 --> 31:00.235
The shield is down!

31:05.073 --> 31:06.073
Fire!

31:09.745 --> 31:10.745
Yes!

31:22.090 --> 31:23.133
Take cover!

31:26.303 --> 31:27.930
Fire at will!

31:40.067 --> 31:41.109
Fall back.

31:42.319 --> 31:43.320
Wong!

31:43.487 --> 31:44.613
Get out of here!

31:50.494 --> 31:51.578
Go, go.

31:51.870 --> 31:52.913
Go!

32:33.078 --> 32:35.789
<i>America...</i>

32:42.254 --> 32:45.257
You want the girl,
you'll have to go through me.

32:46.008 --> 32:47.009
Fine.

33:56.370 --> 33:58.205
We gotta get you out of here. Now.

33:58.664 --> 33:59.873
Wong, what happened?

34:00.040 --> 34:01.625
Kamar-taj has fallen.

34:15.597 --> 34:17.139
Reflections.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.141
She's using the reflections. Cover them.

34:51.382 --> 34:53.010
You gave all those lives...

34:53.177 --> 34:55.888
Just to keep me from my children.

34:56.054 --> 34:57.472
You took those lives.

34:57.848 --> 35:00.517
You cannot be allowed to
cross into the multiverse.

35:00.976 --> 35:02.728
I'm not a monster, Stephen.

35:03.437 --> 35:04.479
I'm a mother.

35:04.646 --> 35:06.440
Wanda, you have no children.

35:07.566 --> 35:08.692
They don't exist.

35:08.859 --> 35:10.569
Oh, but they do.

35:10.736 --> 35:12.863
In every other universe.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.282
I know they do.

35:15.991 --> 35:17.784
Because I dream of them...

35:18.619 --> 35:21.413
Every night.

35:27.836 --> 35:28.921
<i>We're gonna show it.</i>

35:29.087 --> 35:30.214
<i>Mom, watch us. Mom!</i>

35:30.380 --> 35:33.091
Go long. Got it!
All right, go on back, go on back.

35:33.258 --> 35:34.468
All right, yeah. Don't...

35:35.219 --> 35:36.303
Of my boys.

35:36.470 --> 35:37.554
Billy, don't you dare! No!

35:37.721 --> 35:39.515
Of our life together.

35:39.681 --> 35:40.807
- Here.
- Yes!

35:40.974 --> 35:42.184
And then back to front.

35:42.601 --> 35:43.936
Back to front.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.521
Can I have some?

35:45.687 --> 35:46.688
Please?

35:48.106 --> 35:49.167
- Are you guys ready?
- It's okay.

35:49.191 --> 35:50.191
I love you, mom.

35:50.317 --> 35:51.443
Every night...

35:53.779 --> 35:55.239
The same dream.

35:56.657 --> 35:58.534
And every morning...

36:01.453 --> 36:04.623
The same nightmare.

36:07.543 --> 36:09.002
What if you reach them?

36:10.879 --> 36:12.673
What happens to the other you?

36:14.091 --> 36:16.134
What happens to their mother?

38:03.325 --> 38:04.535
You okay?

38:06.203 --> 38:07.496
You saved me.

38:08.205 --> 38:09.790
I hope so.

38:13.585 --> 38:14.625
Surprised you didn't puke.

38:15.128 --> 38:17.506
It's not my first weird trip, kid.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.467
So, this is New York in the multi...

38:22.511 --> 38:23.512
Yep.

38:23.971 --> 38:25.013
There it is.

38:31.562 --> 38:32.813
Crap.

38:35.148 --> 38:36.400
Cut it out.

38:39.194 --> 38:41.655
Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.408
We'll get you fixed.

38:44.950 --> 38:46.118
All right, america.

38:46.910 --> 38:49.110
You gotta open a portal
and get us back there right now.

38:49.162 --> 38:50.163
I don't know how.

38:50.330 --> 38:51.456
You just did it.

38:51.623 --> 38:52.623
Not on purpose.

38:52.708 --> 38:55.627
Wong is back there alone with Wanda,
and I'm the only hope he has.

38:55.794 --> 38:58.565
- I can't control my powers...
- You must be able to control it somehow.

38:58.589 --> 38:59.589
Even I could...

39:02.342 --> 39:03.510
Sorry.

39:05.554 --> 39:07.365
Well, what about
this universe's version of you?

39:07.389 --> 39:09.099
Maybe she could control her powers.

39:09.266 --> 39:11.101
This universe doesn't have a me.

39:11.268 --> 39:12.936
- What?
- None of them do.

39:13.103 --> 39:14.103
But how do you know that?

39:14.229 --> 39:15.772
'Cause I've looked.

39:17.232 --> 39:19.359
And 'cause I never dream.

39:26.450 --> 39:28.160
That's okay, kid.

39:28.327 --> 39:31.413
And even if you could get me back there,
I have no way of fighting Wanda.

39:31.997 --> 39:33.141
What about the book of vishanti?

39:33.165 --> 39:34.166
What about it?

39:34.333 --> 39:36.627
Other you thought it could stop
whoever was after me.

39:36.793 --> 39:38.962
Yeah, well, good for other me.
He's not here, is he?

39:39.129 --> 39:41.924
I don't know where it is,
so unless there's another other me...

39:44.176 --> 39:45.511
We need to go find...

39:46.345 --> 39:48.805
Other other me.

40:20.671 --> 40:21.672
We go on red?

40:21.839 --> 40:24.424
Rule number one of multiversal travel...

40:24.591 --> 40:26.009
You don't know anything.

40:26.677 --> 40:27.678
Right.

40:31.139 --> 40:32.266
It's red.

40:34.059 --> 40:36.228
So, what's rule number two?

40:39.523 --> 40:40.649
America?

40:43.443 --> 40:44.528
America!

40:45.571 --> 40:46.572
Rule number two...

40:46.738 --> 40:48.031
Find food.

40:48.198 --> 40:50.158
Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.

40:51.118 --> 40:52.244
How'd you pay for that?

40:52.411 --> 40:53.411
It was free.

40:53.537 --> 40:55.789
Food's free in most universes, actually.

40:55.956 --> 40:57.833
It's weird you guys have to pay for it.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.835
- Hey! You didn't pay for that.
- Right.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.128
Crap.

41:01.295 --> 41:02.504
Maybe it's not free here.

41:02.671 --> 41:04.631
Pizza poppa always gets paid.

41:04.798 --> 41:06.758
All right, pizza poppa, relax.
She's just a kid...

41:06.925 --> 41:09.206
- She was hungry.
- Relax yourself, there, doctor strange.

41:10.387 --> 41:12.181
Where'd you get this cape from, anyway?

41:12.347 --> 41:14.057
That feels authentic.

41:14.224 --> 41:16.119
It's not a cape, it's a cloak,
and I suggest you let go.

41:16.143 --> 41:19.521
You took this whole suit from
the strange museum, didn't you?

41:19.688 --> 41:21.481
- Strange museum?
- You're a taker.

41:21.648 --> 41:23.192
Why don't you take some mustard, huh?

41:32.743 --> 41:34.119
Come on. It's not permanent.

41:35.287 --> 41:36.914
Like he'll stop in a few minutes?

41:37.831 --> 41:39.333
About three weeks.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.047
Those universes we went through...

41:45.214 --> 41:47.382
Were we paint in one of them?

41:47.549 --> 41:49.885
Yeah, you don't wanna get stuck in there.

41:50.052 --> 41:51.595
It's really hard to eat.

41:52.846 --> 41:54.306
How many universes have you been to?

41:56.808 --> 41:57.809
Seventy-two.

41:58.477 --> 41:59.811
Seventy-three, counting this one.

42:01.563 --> 42:02.648
That's a lot.

42:02.814 --> 42:05.609
<i>Memory Lane.
Replay your significant memories...</i>

42:05.901 --> 42:07.402
<i>Now at a discounted price.</i>

42:07.611 --> 42:10.072
<i>We remember so you don't forget.</i>

42:16.495 --> 42:18.330
This is pretty fancy.

42:18.872 --> 42:21.041
Did you have to take out
another student loan?

42:21.208 --> 42:25.045
Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys
that we operated on last week.

42:27.673 --> 42:30.551
So got you a little something.

42:33.178 --> 42:34.930
Congratulations.

42:35.514 --> 42:36.723
What is it?

42:37.057 --> 42:38.392
Open it and see.

42:43.522 --> 42:45.023
Christine, this is...

42:46.316 --> 42:47.985
This is amazing. Thank you.

42:49.611 --> 42:51.071
We don't have time for this.

42:53.907 --> 42:56.910
<i>Memory Lane.
Replay your significant memories...</i>

42:57.077 --> 42:58.745
<i>Now at a discounted price.</i>

42:58.912 --> 43:00.831
<i>We remember so you don't forget.</i>

43:08.005 --> 43:09.423
Where's this?

43:11.383 --> 43:12.759
Home.

43:13.886 --> 43:15.179
My moms.

43:41.997 --> 43:43.457
America!

44:02.142 --> 44:04.311
You know, you were right.
This is just a waste of time.

44:04.478 --> 44:05.521
Hey, kid.

44:06.188 --> 44:09.149
That was the first time
that you opened a portal, right?

44:09.316 --> 44:10.317
Doesn't matter.

44:10.484 --> 44:12.027
It does matter. You lost your parents.

44:12.194 --> 44:14.488
I didn't lose them. I killed them.

44:14.655 --> 44:16.573
No. No, you did not. Don't even think that.

44:16.740 --> 44:19.493
Okay, I opened a portal
with the powers I can't control...

44:19.660 --> 44:21.679
And sent them to a random,
probably deadly universe...

44:21.703 --> 44:22.847
- With no way to escape.
- Listen...

44:22.871 --> 44:25.290
If your moms are
anything like their daughter...

44:25.457 --> 44:26.625
They survived.

44:27.334 --> 44:29.586
I'm sure you'll meet them again someday.

44:33.799 --> 44:34.842
Not bad.

44:36.093 --> 44:37.553
Thanks.

44:39.054 --> 44:41.014
That woman in your memory bank thing...

44:41.181 --> 44:42.474
That was Christine, right?

44:44.434 --> 44:45.978
Yes, that was Christine.

44:46.144 --> 44:47.938
- How do you know her?
- From other you.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.648
Were they together?

44:49.815 --> 44:51.275
No, they didn't talk anymore.

44:51.441 --> 44:52.442
He blew it.

44:52.609 --> 44:53.610
Of course.

44:54.736 --> 44:56.530
Did you blow it with your Christine?

44:58.031 --> 44:59.908
Yes, I guess I did.

45:00.075 --> 45:01.076
Why?

45:02.411 --> 45:03.495
Complicated.

45:03.662 --> 45:06.224
More complicated than being chased
by a witch through the multiverse?

45:06.248 --> 45:08.208
Yes, actually, it is.

45:48.790 --> 45:50.167
"Gave his life defeating Thanos"?

45:50.334 --> 45:52.336
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

45:53.587 --> 45:55.464
If other you's dead...

45:55.672 --> 45:57.424
Who's master of the sanctum?

46:03.430 --> 46:05.390
Oh, shit.

46:15.192 --> 46:17.528
- You know him?
- Yeah. Mordo.

46:17.694 --> 46:19.894
He was actually the first guy
who let me into kamar-taj.

46:19.947 --> 46:20.947
Oh, great.

46:20.989 --> 46:24.076
And then he snapped and
dedicated his life to trying to kill me.

46:24.243 --> 46:25.619
Oh.

46:25.786 --> 46:27.037
Great.

46:31.667 --> 46:33.961
I always suspected this day would come.

46:34.127 --> 46:35.128
You did?

46:35.546 --> 46:36.547
Yes.

46:37.381 --> 46:41.176
Because you always suspected
this day would come.

46:49.351 --> 46:50.519
My brother.

46:54.857 --> 46:55.858
All right.

46:57.943 --> 46:59.236
Come in...

46:59.403 --> 47:03.657
And tell me everything about your universe.

47:08.996 --> 47:10.622
You go on red.

47:13.292 --> 47:15.419
<i>And you're quite formidable too, it seems.</i>

47:15.752 --> 47:18.255
A multiversal traveler.

47:18.422 --> 47:21.592
Well, thank the stars
you brought doctor strange to safety.

47:21.758 --> 47:24.052
Well, just 'cause we jumped ship
doesn't mean we're safe.

47:24.595 --> 47:27.681
Our Wanda has the ability to
conjure demons and monsters...

47:27.848 --> 47:30.184
To attack america in other universes.

47:30.350 --> 47:31.810
So she has the darkhold?

47:31.977 --> 47:33.478
Oh, you know of the darkhold?

47:33.645 --> 47:36.273
Oh, yes. We have a darkhold
in this universe, too.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.442
I guard it here in this sanctum.

47:38.609 --> 47:42.529
We would never risk a weapon that dangerous
falling into the wrong hands.

47:42.696 --> 47:43.697
Damn right.

47:43.864 --> 47:47.159
But if your darkhold is anything like ours,
I'm afraid she can do far worse...

47:47.326 --> 47:50.871
Than just summon monsters
to come after you here.

47:51.455 --> 47:52.456
What do you mean?

47:52.623 --> 47:56.793
There is a spell
contained within those pages...

47:58.337 --> 48:00.172
Corrosive to the soul...

48:01.798 --> 48:04.301
A desecration of reality itself.

48:06.220 --> 48:07.221
Dreamwalking.

48:09.264 --> 48:12.434
A dreamwalking sorcerer projects
their own consciousness...

48:12.601 --> 48:15.145
From their universe into another...

48:16.146 --> 48:19.066
Possessing the body of an alternate self.

48:21.985 --> 48:27.282
They may puppeteer this unholy doppelganger
and pursue their enemies from afar.

48:30.702 --> 48:34.915
The possession is not a permanent link
between realities.

48:35.082 --> 48:37.668
But in the fleeting time they dreamwalk...

48:37.835 --> 48:41.713
They can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.

48:44.508 --> 48:47.427
So it may not be a demon that you face.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.474
It may be the Scarlet witch.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.061
Why didn't she do that to begin with?

48:56.228 --> 48:58.480
Because that was her being reasonable.

48:59.731 --> 49:01.371
What do you know of the book of vishanti?

49:01.441 --> 49:02.985
The darkhold's antithesis?

49:04.111 --> 49:08.448
It can give a sorcerer whatever power
they need to vanquish their enemy.

49:10.242 --> 49:12.786
I need your help to get me to it.

49:16.373 --> 49:17.624
I'm sorry, Stephen.

49:19.168 --> 49:22.880
But I hope you,
of all people, understand...

49:23.297 --> 49:27.759
That it is not Wanda maximoff
who threatens our reality...

49:28.886 --> 49:30.095
It's the two of you.

49:31.430 --> 49:33.599
- Oh, god.
- What was in that tea?

49:37.477 --> 49:41.190
You son of a bitch.

49:51.950 --> 49:53.994
The sands of nisanti.

49:54.786 --> 49:57.956
I'm only acting as you would.

50:00.792 --> 50:02.836
She's coming.

50:25.817 --> 50:26.944
Boys, it's time for bed.

50:27.110 --> 50:28.737
Can we have a little more ice cream?

50:28.904 --> 50:30.256
- Please.
- Please, please, please!

50:30.280 --> 50:32.759
- A little more, please!
- Hey, don't make mom out to be the bad guy.

50:32.783 --> 50:33.784
You know who's the best?

50:33.951 --> 50:36.328
- Who?
- 2003 tigers.

50:36.495 --> 50:37.496
They suck.

50:37.663 --> 50:39.456
They're so bad they suck egg.

50:39.623 --> 50:41.291
No, they don't. They're the best.

50:41.458 --> 50:43.252
- Doofus.
- Doofus 2.

50:43.418 --> 50:45.170
Triple infinity doofus.

50:45.337 --> 50:48.632
Infinity infinity googolplex
quadruple doofus.

50:48.799 --> 50:52.219
Quintuple infinity... crazy doofus.

50:52.386 --> 50:53.887
Googolplex doofus.

51:45.230 --> 51:46.273
Mom?

51:51.737 --> 51:53.280
Yes, sweetheart?

51:53.447 --> 51:54.615
Where are you going?

51:58.452 --> 52:00.913
Just to take out the trash.

52:02.164 --> 52:03.707
Can we show you something?

52:05.834 --> 52:08.378
Mom, hurry, come on!

52:08.545 --> 52:09.880
Come on, it's important.

52:10.047 --> 52:11.047
Mom.

52:11.089 --> 52:12.424
You'll like it.

52:12.591 --> 52:15.427
Come on. Hurry up.

52:15.594 --> 52:16.720
It's important.

52:17.721 --> 52:20.474
Okay, so, mom, listen to this...

52:20.641 --> 52:21.642
I'm gonna start it.

52:21.808 --> 52:22.809
No, I wanna start it.

52:22.976 --> 52:24.204
- I wanna start it. I want to start!
- No, I want to start!

52:24.228 --> 52:25.330
- No! I want to start.
- I want to start.

52:25.354 --> 52:29.691
Why don't you both start it...

52:29.858 --> 52:33.070
Whatever it is, together?

52:34.238 --> 52:35.405
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:35.572 --> 52:36.823
- You ready?
- Yeah.

52:36.990 --> 52:39.701
Three, two, one, go.

52:39.868 --> 52:43.163
<i>We like ice cream.</i>

52:43.330 --> 52:46.625
<i>Like every child should.</i>

52:46.792 --> 52:50.379
<i>And if we get some ice cream.</i>

52:50.546 --> 52:56.093
<i>We promise to be good.</i>

53:23.871 --> 53:24.872
You're alive.

53:25.581 --> 53:26.582
Yes.

53:27.207 --> 53:29.126
But so many others were lost.

53:31.044 --> 53:32.421
Set me free.

53:32.588 --> 53:34.089
I need to destroy the book.

53:34.256 --> 53:37.050
No. It cannot be you.

53:44.850 --> 53:46.518
Sara. No, no!

54:05.787 --> 54:07.206
Mom!

54:07.372 --> 54:08.582
<i>What happened?</i>

54:10.959 --> 54:12.252
- What?
- Are you okay?

54:15.088 --> 54:17.382
Okay. Billy, Tommy.

54:18.967 --> 54:19.968
What?

54:25.807 --> 54:29.728
No, no, no.

54:49.873 --> 54:51.875
I need the darkhold's spells.

54:52.042 --> 54:54.503
You are the sorcerer supreme.

54:54.670 --> 54:55.879
Tell me what you know.

54:57.673 --> 54:59.466
You're gonna have to kill me, witch.

55:00.175 --> 55:01.343
Not you.

55:02.761 --> 55:04.012
Them.

55:10.143 --> 55:11.311
Wanda, stop.

55:14.022 --> 55:15.315
Wanda, please!

55:20.320 --> 55:22.364
The darkhold was a copy!

55:25.117 --> 55:26.326
A copy?

55:26.493 --> 55:27.786
Legend speaks of a mountain...

55:27.953 --> 55:30.622
With the wretched spells you seek
carved into its walls.

55:31.957 --> 55:34.626
It's there the darkhold was transcribed.

55:35.586 --> 55:36.837
Mount wundagore.

55:37.838 --> 55:39.173
Wundagore?

55:39.923 --> 55:41.800
No one has survived the journey.

55:46.180 --> 55:48.891
Perhaps we will be the exception.

55:56.231 --> 55:57.608
Hey!

55:58.400 --> 55:59.651
Hey!

56:12.206 --> 56:13.999
This universe sucks.

56:16.877 --> 56:17.961
Cloak?

56:29.431 --> 56:30.432
Hey.

56:32.226 --> 56:33.477
Hey, lab coat.

56:34.228 --> 56:35.312
Where the hell are we?

56:36.730 --> 56:39.770
Look, I don't know who you are, or
what you think you're trying to do here...

56:39.858 --> 56:41.902
- But these situations don't usually...
- Thank you.

56:42.069 --> 56:44.655
Work out well for the
nameless scientists, so just...

56:49.159 --> 56:50.452
Christine?

56:52.287 --> 56:53.372
Hello, Stephen.

56:55.916 --> 56:57.042
Miss Chavez.

56:58.710 --> 57:00.003
To answer your question...

57:00.170 --> 57:02.631
You are in a highly
secure research facility.

57:02.798 --> 57:04.925
The two of you,
along with your sentient cloak...

57:05.092 --> 57:07.052
Are here for surveillance and testing.

57:08.136 --> 57:09.263
Testing?

57:09.429 --> 57:11.932
Well, yes. You're visitors
from another universe.

57:12.099 --> 57:15.644
Your magnetic signatures
could be radioactive...

57:15.811 --> 57:18.438
You may be carrying diseases
we just don't have treatments for.

57:19.231 --> 57:22.150
Hence, these amazing
polycarbonate fish bowls.

57:23.610 --> 57:26.238
I assume I have you
to thank for these then?

57:26.738 --> 57:29.992
Yes. I developed those
using the sands of nisanti.

57:30.158 --> 57:32.452
One of 838 Stephen's magical relics.

57:32.619 --> 57:33.619
838 Stephen?

57:33.745 --> 57:35.330
Is that some kind of cyborg me, or...

57:35.497 --> 57:39.793
Our universe is 838,
and we've designated yours 616.

57:40.627 --> 57:42.796
You guys sure must know a lot
about the multiverse...

57:42.963 --> 57:45.132
If you got someone going around
naming realities.

57:45.299 --> 57:46.300
Yes.

57:47.050 --> 57:48.302
Me.

57:48.468 --> 57:50.388
I'm a senior fellow
with the Baxter foundation...

57:50.554 --> 57:52.598
And I specialize in multiversal research.

57:54.892 --> 57:56.935
So, how'd you end up working here?

57:57.102 --> 57:59.062
Wherever here is.

57:59.229 --> 58:00.564
Well, I volunteered.

58:01.148 --> 58:02.524
At your funeral.

58:03.734 --> 58:05.068
Thank you for going.

58:05.569 --> 58:08.780
Your injuries, they're similar,
but they're not identical.

58:08.947 --> 58:10.199
It's fascinating.

58:15.954 --> 58:20.292
What were we to each
other in this universe?

58:23.962 --> 58:25.964
We never quite figured that out.

58:26.256 --> 58:27.382
Yeah?

58:29.009 --> 58:31.094
Well, that's something we got in common.

58:33.889 --> 58:37.142
Christine, you gotta let us out of here.

58:37.893 --> 58:39.603
Everyone's in real danger.

58:39.770 --> 58:41.813
Look, I know you don't know me...

58:41.980 --> 58:42.980
And I don't want to.

58:43.482 --> 58:47.277
Whatever I was to you in your universe
does not matter.

58:48.529 --> 58:49.613
Why not?

58:54.618 --> 58:56.328
Because you're dangerous, Stephen.

58:58.121 --> 59:00.624
Someone from my universe wants that girl...

59:00.791 --> 59:03.502
And she's gonna rip this place apart
atom-by-atom...

59:03.669 --> 59:05.087
Until she gets what she wants.

59:05.254 --> 59:08.715
So I don't care if you're from the avengers
or S.H.I.E.L.D...

59:08.882 --> 59:09.883
We're neither.

59:15.806 --> 59:17.015
Well, what then?

59:17.182 --> 59:18.183
Hydra?

59:18.350 --> 59:22.437
The illuminati will see you now.

59:22.604 --> 59:23.814
The illumi-what-y?

59:31.864 --> 59:33.532
Don't let anyone hurt that kid.

59:37.828 --> 59:39.246
It's gonna be okay.

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:11.361
You couldn't portal us up there?

01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:13.947
My magic can only take us so far.

01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:16.617
Masters of the mystic arts
weren't meant to tread...

01:00:16.783 --> 01:00:19.161
Upon the forbidden grounds of wundagore.

01:00:44.311 --> 01:00:50.108
Eons ago, the first demon, chthon,
carved his dark magic...

01:00:50.275 --> 01:00:52.694
Into this tomb.

01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:57.616
These same spells were later transcribed
into the darkhold.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.552
There's no telling
what soulless monstrosities lie within.

01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:00.971
They've been waiting for me.

01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:11.023
This isn't a tomb.

01:02:15.194 --> 01:02:16.778
It's a throne.

01:02:51.813 --> 01:02:53.524
Stephen strange...

01:02:54.191 --> 01:02:56.818
You are now called before the illuminati.

01:02:56.985 --> 01:03:00.739
I, baron Karl mordo, the sorcerer supreme,
do hereby...

01:03:00.906 --> 01:03:02.032
"Karl"?

01:03:06.328 --> 01:03:07.871
Captain Carter.

01:03:08.038 --> 01:03:09.248
The first avenger.

01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:12.042
Blackagar boltagon.

01:03:12.209 --> 01:03:15.128
Keeper of the terrigen mists,
the inhuman king.

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:16.338
Blackagar boltagon?

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.049
Hidigy hidithere.

01:03:20.843 --> 01:03:23.387
Captain marvel. Defender of the cosmos.

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:27.474
And the smartest man alive...

01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:30.227
Reed Richards of the fantastic four.

01:03:31.436 --> 01:03:32.437
Hello, Stephen.

01:03:32.604 --> 01:03:33.604
"Fantastic four."

01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:35.107
Didn't you guys chart in the '60s?

01:03:35.274 --> 01:03:37.317
I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

01:03:37.484 --> 01:03:38.878
Well, there's a guy over there
with a fork on his head...

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:40.279
So, yeah, a little bit.

01:03:41.738 --> 01:03:44.283
Be grateful black bolt
doesn't engage you in conversation.

01:03:44.449 --> 01:03:46.118
Why? Does he have bad breath?

01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:48.328
This strange is even
more arrogant than ours.

01:03:49.121 --> 01:03:50.539
No, just more alive.

01:03:50.706 --> 01:03:51.832
For now.

01:03:53.417 --> 01:03:57.296
Stephen, your arrival here
confuses and destabilizes reality.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:01.508
The larger the footprint you leave behind,
the greater the risk of an incursion.

01:04:01.675 --> 01:04:02.676
Incursion?

01:04:02.843 --> 01:04:07.014
An incursion occurs when the boundary
between two universes erodes...

01:04:07.181 --> 01:04:08.390
And they collide...

01:04:09.141 --> 01:04:13.187
Destroying one or both entirely.

01:04:13.854 --> 01:04:16.523
Your alternate self
created the illuminati...

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:19.234
To make difficult decisions
that no one else could.

01:04:19.401 --> 01:04:23.113
Today, we're here to determine
what to do with you and the child.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.907
So, before we vote...

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:28.785
If you got anything serious to say,
now's the time.

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.245
Yeah, I do.

01:04:30.412 --> 01:04:31.848
If it's incursions you're worried about...

01:04:31.872 --> 01:04:34.499
Do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat
than the Scarlet witch?

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:37.711
Oh, we can handle your little witch
if she decides to dreamwalk.

01:04:37.878 --> 01:04:41.173
No. No, you cannot. Not unless
you give me the book of vishanti.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:45.052
We appreciate your concern, Stephen, but
it's not the Scarlet witch that we fear.

01:04:45.219 --> 01:04:48.931
From our experience, the greatest danger
to the multiverse, it turns out...

01:04:49.097 --> 01:04:50.724
Is doctor strange.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.560
Wait. Your doctor strange?

01:04:53.727 --> 01:04:56.355
Earth's mightiest hero
who died defeating Thanos?

01:04:56.522 --> 01:04:58.232
We should tell him the truth.

01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:07.533
Our final member...

01:05:08.784 --> 01:05:10.619
Professor Charles Xavier.

01:05:12.496 --> 01:05:13.497
What truth?

01:05:13.664 --> 01:05:16.250
That's not how our strange died.

01:05:34.017 --> 01:05:36.019
You're wondering what happens now.

01:05:36.812 --> 01:05:38.063
No.

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.857
That I've already accepted.

01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:41.733
But I do wonder...

01:05:43.235 --> 01:05:46.780
When you could force america to send you
to any universe you want...

01:05:46.947 --> 01:05:48.699
Why take her power for your own?

01:05:48.866 --> 01:05:50.617
You know it would kill her.

01:05:50.784 --> 01:05:52.619
For Billy and Tommy, to protect them.

01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:55.163
What if they get sick?

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:59.376
In the infinite multiverse,
there's a cure for every illness.

01:06:00.669 --> 01:06:04.006
A solution to every problem.

01:06:06.383 --> 01:06:08.260
I won't lose them again.

01:06:08.427 --> 01:06:11.513
Try as you might, Wanda,
you cannot control everything.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.223
But I can.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:15.017
Look around you.

01:06:15.642 --> 01:06:17.895
It's carved in stone.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.316
I was meant to rule everything.

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:29.031
But that's not what I want.

01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:30.866
I just want my boys.

01:06:31.033 --> 01:06:33.076
At the cost of a child's life?

01:06:34.286 --> 01:06:38.207
Is there no peace in knowing that even
though you can't be with the ones you love...

01:06:38.373 --> 01:06:40.584
There are worlds where you are together?

01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:41.752
Is that not enough?

01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:43.961
No.

01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:24.086
Our strange did not die defeating Thanos.

01:07:24.711 --> 01:07:26.421
We were at war.

01:07:26.588 --> 01:07:30.300
While the rest of us banded together
to try to stop Thanos...

01:07:30.467 --> 01:07:34.429
Stephen, as always,
chose to go it alone.

01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:36.306
He turned to the darkhold...

01:07:36.473 --> 01:07:38.058
Began dreamwalking...

01:07:38.225 --> 01:07:40.769
In hopes that our salvation
might lie in the multiverse.

01:07:41.103 --> 01:07:42.354
And guess what?

01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:45.107
It didn't. But he kept doing it anyway.

01:07:45.315 --> 01:07:47.192
One night, you called us all together...

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:49.403
Confessed that you had been dreamwalking...

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:52.865
And in your words,
"things had gotten out of hand."

01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:55.242
You never told us the details
of what had happened...

01:07:55.409 --> 01:07:58.579
Only that you had inadvertently triggered
an incursion.

01:07:59.079 --> 01:08:04.459
You, our friend, had caused the
annihilation of another universe.

01:08:04.835 --> 01:08:07.254
Everyone in that reality died.

01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:08.422
Everyone.

01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:10.757
Stephen renounced the darkhold's evil...

01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:13.051
And helped us find the book of vishanti...

01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:17.345
A weapon we did use together
to defeat Thanos.

01:08:17.514 --> 01:08:19.683
But one final threat remained.

01:08:47.711 --> 01:08:50.130
I shall miss you, my friend.

01:08:54.009 --> 01:08:55.385
I'm ready.

01:09:03.393 --> 01:09:05.687
I'm sorry.

01:09:27.334 --> 01:09:28.961
Did you tell Christine?

01:09:30.212 --> 01:09:31.296
Yes.

01:09:36.885 --> 01:09:37.886
The statue...

01:09:38.053 --> 01:09:39.513
What about the statue?

01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:43.767
You built a statue.

01:09:43.934 --> 01:09:45.560
The world needs heroes.

01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:49.481
We made the difficult choice because
we knew what our strange was capable of.

01:09:51.066 --> 01:09:55.237
What, perhaps, every doctor strange
is capable of.

01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:00.367
The building's been breached.

01:10:00.534 --> 01:10:01.994
No shit, genius.

01:10:02.995 --> 01:10:04.580
Status report on sentries.

01:10:06.957 --> 01:10:08.000
<i>Stop where you...</i>

01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:09.543
<i>Get back!</i>

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:17.050
<i>Stop where you are...</i>

01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:18.427
She's heading for the child.

01:10:18.594 --> 01:10:20.387
Watch him. We'll vote on our return.

01:10:22.139 --> 01:10:24.933
Stephen, should you manage
to escape this chamber...

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.102
You must guide america Chavez.

01:10:27.269 --> 01:10:28.604
What the hell are you saying?

01:10:28.812 --> 01:10:31.064
Save the girl
and get to the book of vishanti.

01:10:31.231 --> 01:10:32.608
What? You have the book here?

01:10:32.774 --> 01:10:35.027
Yes. You built a waypoint.

01:10:35.194 --> 01:10:37.362
Charles, we cannot trust him.

01:10:37.529 --> 01:10:39.489
I believe we can.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.701
Just because someone stumbles
and loses their way...

01:10:42.868 --> 01:10:44.703
Doesn't mean they're lost forever.

01:10:45.412 --> 01:10:49.166
We will see what kind of doctor strange
you are.

01:10:49.958 --> 01:10:50.959
Thank you.

01:10:52.461 --> 01:10:53.504
<i>Perimeter breakdown.</i>

01:10:54.588 --> 01:10:56.673
<i>All sentries engage.</i>

01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.134
Everybody out.

01:10:59.301 --> 01:11:00.969
<i>- Intruder approaching.
</i>- Now!

01:11:03.263 --> 01:11:04.389
It's Wanda.

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:19.905
<i>Ultron commands you to halt.</i>

01:11:22.032 --> 01:11:24.076
<i>Ultron commands...</i>

01:11:27.204 --> 01:11:28.747
Hurry, hurry! She's coming!

01:11:33.293 --> 01:11:34.461
Oh, no.

01:11:55.941 --> 01:11:57.192
Wanda, stop.

01:11:58.026 --> 01:12:00.906
You've possessed an innocent woman,
but you can still do the right thing.

01:12:01.738 --> 01:12:02.906
Let her go.

01:12:06.076 --> 01:12:07.077
Please.

01:12:07.744 --> 01:12:10.789
I have children of my own.
I understand your pain.

01:12:10.956 --> 01:12:13.292
Is their mother still alive?

01:12:14.501 --> 01:12:15.502
Yes.

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:16.670
Good.

01:12:16.837 --> 01:12:19.882
There will be someone left to raise them.

01:12:22.509 --> 01:12:26.513
Wanda, black bolt could destroy you
with one whisper from his mouth.

01:12:28.432 --> 01:12:29.433
What mouth?

01:13:27.282 --> 01:13:30.619
Take me to the book of vishanti,
so that we can fight her together.

01:13:30.786 --> 01:13:32.746
You are in no position to give orders.

01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:37.084
My vote will conclude these proceedings
when they return.

01:13:49.513 --> 01:13:50.681
Haven't you had enough?

01:13:51.849 --> 01:13:53.267
Oh, I could do this all day.

01:14:29.636 --> 01:14:32.264
Get the hell out of my universe!

01:15:06.215 --> 01:15:07.841
They're not coming back.

01:15:08.008 --> 01:15:11.220
And you just cast your vote now
to kill your friends.

01:15:15.098 --> 01:15:16.725
Not that that ever bothered you before.

01:15:19.811 --> 01:15:22.064
You know, you hated me where I came from.

01:15:22.231 --> 01:15:25.150
And I bet secretly, my brother,
you hated me here.

01:15:25.317 --> 01:15:27.277
You must've been so jealous.

01:15:27.694 --> 01:15:28.695
Do you know what?

01:15:28.862 --> 01:15:31.049
I bet you were thrilled when you heard
I'd been corrupted.

01:15:31.073 --> 01:15:33.051
Hell, you probably gave me the darkhold
to begin with...

01:15:33.075 --> 01:15:34.826
You know nothing of this universe!

01:15:34.993 --> 01:15:38.622
I know that killing Stephen strange
was your ticket to getting the sanctum...

01:15:38.789 --> 01:15:40.249
To becoming sorcerer supreme...

01:15:40.415 --> 01:15:43.085
And to joining your little
circus of clowns, the illuminati.

01:15:43.252 --> 01:15:44.711
I'm ready...

01:15:47.756 --> 01:15:50.676
To cast my vote now.

01:16:55.908 --> 01:16:57.701
I think I'm beginning to understand...

01:16:58.118 --> 01:17:01.830
Why your mordo didn't like you very much!

01:17:04.249 --> 01:17:05.250
You're sealed shut!

01:17:15.177 --> 01:17:16.845
Okay. Get back.

01:17:28.106 --> 01:17:29.107
Whoa.

01:17:29.274 --> 01:17:30.274
Whoa.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.864
Enough!

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:32.963
Help me. Please.

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:36.967
Wanda maximoff, your mind is
being held hostage by your alternate self.

01:18:40.637 --> 01:18:41.763
Grab my hand.

01:18:42.639 --> 01:18:45.017
Perhaps, if I can pull you
from under the rubble...

01:18:45.434 --> 01:18:46.685
The spell will break.

01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:35.484
Hey! You all right?

01:19:36.944 --> 01:19:37.945
You okay?

01:19:39.404 --> 01:19:40.405
Hey.

01:19:41.949 --> 01:19:43.700
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:19:45.452 --> 01:19:46.453
Hey.

01:19:47.955 --> 01:19:49.414
She fixed him.

01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:50.749
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:53.019
Xavier said I built a waypoint
to the book of vishanti.

01:19:53.043 --> 01:19:54.043
Can you take us there?

01:19:54.086 --> 01:19:55.230
How am I supposed to trust you?

01:19:55.254 --> 01:19:57.374
I know what happened,
and I'm sorry for what he did...

01:19:57.464 --> 01:19:59.550
But believe me,
the book of vishanti is the only way.

01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:00.717
Yeah. Your way.

01:20:00.884 --> 01:20:03.053
You sound a lot like my Stephen right now.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:06.932
He had to be the one holding the knife, and
then that knife killed a trillion people.

01:20:07.099 --> 01:20:08.767
This Stephen is different.

01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:10.602
He is.

01:20:10.769 --> 01:20:12.609
It doesn't matter
about all the other Stephens.

01:20:13.939 --> 01:20:15.315
You're not like them.

01:20:19.278 --> 01:20:20.404
Smart kid.

01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:25.951
Give me your hand.

01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:32.416
Do not make me regret this.

01:20:32.583 --> 01:20:33.667
I won't.

01:20:35.127 --> 01:20:36.920
- Okay, can we go now?
- Yeah, follow me.

01:20:51.476 --> 01:20:52.477
Where's that tunnel go?

01:20:52.769 --> 01:20:54.188
Under the river.

01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:03.363
Go, go, go!

01:22:07.845 --> 01:22:09.847
Where did she go?

01:22:20.816 --> 01:22:22.025
I warned you.

01:22:23.026 --> 01:22:25.320
Other Wanda, if you're in there...

01:22:25.487 --> 01:22:26.530
Hold your breath.

01:22:36.164 --> 01:22:38.208
- Did you kill her?
- No, just bought us some time.

01:22:40.335 --> 01:22:41.545
The book's through here.

01:22:41.712 --> 01:22:43.072
But only Stephen's ever opened it.

01:22:53.348 --> 01:22:54.516
Shit.

01:22:55.934 --> 01:22:58.121
An enchantment that's specific to me,
something only I would know.

01:22:58.145 --> 01:22:59.897
- Wait. Stephen.
- Come on.

01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:02.649
Come on.

01:23:02.816 --> 01:23:04.318
Stephen.

01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:13.702
Yeah.

01:23:16.663 --> 01:23:17.664
Thank you.

01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:19.750
Sure.

01:23:25.214 --> 01:23:26.548
Open sesame.

01:23:59.248 --> 01:24:00.249
Come on, kid.

01:24:00.874 --> 01:24:02.084
You got this.

01:24:03.836 --> 01:24:05.128
We got this.

01:24:07.506 --> 01:24:08.590
Yeah.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.641
You all right?

01:24:17.808 --> 01:24:18.934
Yeah.

01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:24.523
This is the gap junction,
the space between universes.

01:24:37.744 --> 01:24:39.204
All right, book.

01:24:42.499 --> 01:24:43.876
Give me what I need.

01:25:02.436 --> 01:25:03.437
- No!
- No!

01:25:56.865 --> 01:25:58.158
My boys.

01:26:09.878 --> 01:26:11.518
This isn't what your children would want.

01:26:27.521 --> 01:26:28.939
They'll never know.

01:26:29.106 --> 01:26:30.190
Maybe not.

01:26:30.774 --> 01:26:31.775
But you will.

01:26:35.737 --> 01:26:36.989
Oh, no.

01:26:37.155 --> 01:26:38.490
Oh, crap.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.870
It's like this reality
collapsed in on itself.

01:26:43.078 --> 01:26:44.121
Yeah.

01:26:44.621 --> 01:26:46.331
Or two realities collided.

01:26:47.457 --> 01:26:48.625
Come on.

01:26:49.084 --> 01:26:50.794
America doesn't have long.

01:26:51.211 --> 01:26:52.504
So where are we going?

01:26:52.671 --> 01:26:55.966
Well, if there's still a sanctum
in this universe...

01:26:57.092 --> 01:27:00.637
Then there might be
another other other me...

01:27:00.804 --> 01:27:03.307
And that's our best shot
of getting back to her.

01:27:15.777 --> 01:27:19.114
Well, I can see why you guys
were so worried about incursions.

01:27:21.241 --> 01:27:22.659
Whatever happened...

01:27:23.744 --> 01:27:27.206
This universe's you didn't do
a very good job of stopping it.

01:27:37.633 --> 01:27:39.510
I'll tell him you said that.

01:28:39.945 --> 01:28:41.071
Hello?

01:28:48.912 --> 01:28:50.163
Stop where you are.

01:28:52.541 --> 01:28:54.585
How did you get here?

01:28:55.502 --> 01:28:56.670
By accident.

01:28:58.672 --> 01:28:59.673
Who are you?

01:29:00.674 --> 01:29:01.675
What are you?

01:29:01.842 --> 01:29:03.927
I'm just one of us.

01:29:04.094 --> 01:29:05.596
From the multiverse?

01:29:05.762 --> 01:29:06.972
That's right.

01:29:08.682 --> 01:29:09.766
Prove it.

01:29:13.187 --> 01:29:14.521
We had a sister.

01:29:15.063 --> 01:29:16.064
Donna.

01:29:18.901 --> 01:29:19.943
But she...

01:29:21.528 --> 01:29:23.488
She died when we were kids.

01:29:25.616 --> 01:29:26.658
How?

01:29:28.076 --> 01:29:33.832
We were playing on a frozen lake and...

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.838
She fell through the ice.

01:29:46.178 --> 01:29:48.013
I couldn't save her.

01:29:50.224 --> 01:29:51.892
Sounds about right.

01:29:54.561 --> 01:29:57.022
But we don't talk about that, do we?

01:29:58.357 --> 01:29:59.525
No, we don't.

01:30:01.151 --> 01:30:03.779
Suppose your reality
wasn't always like this.

01:30:03.946 --> 01:30:06.406
I suspect it was
somewhat like yours until...

01:30:06.573 --> 01:30:07.574
Until?

01:30:09.535 --> 01:30:10.953
Until I lost.

01:30:12.371 --> 01:30:13.997
To whom?

01:30:17.543 --> 01:30:18.877
What do you want?

01:30:19.628 --> 01:30:22.130
I just want to get home.

01:30:22.297 --> 01:30:23.841
Yeah? Believe me...

01:30:24.007 --> 01:30:26.927
I've been trying to leave this place
for a long time.

01:30:28.095 --> 01:30:29.429
Darkhold.

01:30:29.596 --> 01:30:32.349
You guard the darkhold in this universe?

01:30:32.516 --> 01:30:33.559
Yeah.

01:30:34.184 --> 01:30:35.227
For good reason.

01:30:35.394 --> 01:30:36.395
That's a start.

01:30:36.562 --> 01:30:39.606
I could use it. It could help me
to communicate with my universe.

01:30:39.773 --> 01:30:40.941
Careful.

01:30:41.859 --> 01:30:44.361
The darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

01:30:44.528 --> 01:30:47.447
I don't mean to be callous...

01:30:47.614 --> 01:30:50.492
But how much of a heavier toll
is there left to exact?

01:30:50.659 --> 01:30:52.828
Not just on its reality.

01:30:53.203 --> 01:30:54.454
On its reader.

01:30:55.539 --> 01:30:57.499
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't save
your universe...

01:30:57.583 --> 01:31:00.127
But maybe you could help to save mine.

01:31:03.213 --> 01:31:05.090
Are you happy, Stephen?

01:31:06.008 --> 01:31:07.092
What?

01:31:07.718 --> 01:31:12.347
Are you happy, Stephen?

01:31:14.266 --> 01:31:16.602
It's the question that...

01:31:18.103 --> 01:31:19.771
Christine Palmer...

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.232
Asked me at her wedding.

01:31:25.235 --> 01:31:27.738
I said, "yes, of course I'm happy."

01:31:27.905 --> 01:31:32.993
"I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods.
What man wouldn't be happy?"

01:31:33.744 --> 01:31:38.916
And then I came back
to this goddamn haunted house...

01:31:39.082 --> 01:31:40.501
Sat down...

01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:44.379
And wondered why I'd lied.

01:31:46.673 --> 01:31:49.426
I never meant for any of this to happen.

01:31:51.261 --> 01:31:54.264
I was looking for a world
where things were different.

01:31:56.433 --> 01:31:59.937
Where I had Christine, where I was happy.

01:32:02.064 --> 01:32:03.524
But I didn't find it.

01:32:05.150 --> 01:32:07.319
All I found were more of us.

01:32:09.279 --> 01:32:11.657
So I did those Stephens a favor.

01:32:13.283 --> 01:32:15.911
You ever had that dream
where you're falling...

01:32:16.078 --> 01:32:19.790
As if you've been
pushed off a tall building?

01:32:22.793 --> 01:32:24.628
That was probably me.

01:32:33.136 --> 01:32:35.722
The darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

01:32:35.889 --> 01:32:37.349
Okay.

01:32:38.267 --> 01:32:40.853
All the more reason to give it a rest
and let me have it.

01:32:41.019 --> 01:32:42.437
Here's the deal.

01:32:42.604 --> 01:32:47.401
I'll let you use the darkhold
if you give me your Christine.

01:32:48.151 --> 01:32:49.444
Yeah.

01:32:49.611 --> 01:32:51.613
I don't think she's gonna go for that.

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.781
No?

01:32:53.907 --> 01:32:55.242
Didn't think so.

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.493
Hang on, we're coming.

01:36:31.166 --> 01:36:32.918
What are you doing with the darkhold?

01:36:35.045 --> 01:36:36.964
Are you going to dreamwalk?

01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:39.383
It's a little bit more
than just dreamwalking.

01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:41.844
All you stranges, you're the same.

01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:43.053
I know.

01:36:45.138 --> 01:36:46.223
You're right.

01:36:47.057 --> 01:36:48.392
We are all the same.

01:36:49.434 --> 01:36:50.853
But right now, that kid needs me.

01:36:51.019 --> 01:36:54.690
And I can't do any of
this without your help.

01:36:55.566 --> 01:36:58.110
While I'm under,
I need you to protect my body...

01:36:58.277 --> 01:37:00.279
In case they attack me for trespassing.

01:37:00.612 --> 01:37:01.780
Who's "they"?

01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:05.742
The souls of the damned.

01:37:27.973 --> 01:37:28.974
Okay.

01:37:29.141 --> 01:37:33.145
But doesn't a version of you
need to live in that universe...

01:37:33.312 --> 01:37:35.105
So that you can dreamwalk into them?

01:37:36.773 --> 01:37:38.609
Who said they had to be living?

01:38:52.432 --> 01:38:54.226
Stephen strange...

01:38:54.393 --> 01:38:57.104
Possessing a dead body is forbidden.

01:38:57.271 --> 01:38:58.897
Forbidden.

01:38:59.064 --> 01:39:00.482
Trespasser!

01:39:00.649 --> 01:39:02.109
Trespasser!

01:39:03.527 --> 01:39:07.739
Cease your dreamwalk,
or face the eternal consequences.

01:39:16.665 --> 01:39:17.791
<i>Stephen!</i>

01:39:18.458 --> 01:39:20.294
They're pulling me down.

01:39:21.795 --> 01:39:23.005
<i>Stephen!</i>

01:39:30.721 --> 01:39:32.222
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:39:33.015 --> 01:39:34.016
Where are you?

01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:02.628
The brazier of bom'galiath.

01:40:13.347 --> 01:40:14.348
Go back to hell.

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.070
Stephen.

01:40:29.571 --> 01:40:30.864
I've got you.

01:40:32.074 --> 01:40:34.451
You're a master of the mystic arts.

01:40:34.868 --> 01:40:36.370
They're spirits.

01:40:36.537 --> 01:40:37.537
Use them.

01:40:42.793 --> 01:40:43.794
Use them.

01:40:46.213 --> 01:40:47.214
Use them.

01:41:03.897 --> 01:41:05.190
No!

01:41:59.119 --> 01:42:00.119
Come on!

01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:36.323
Strange!

01:42:45.666 --> 01:42:47.501
Dreamwalking. You hypocrite!

01:42:54.258 --> 01:42:56.218
This time, it's gonna take more
than killing me...

01:42:56.301 --> 01:42:57.553
To kill me.

01:43:05.894 --> 01:43:08.438
Murderer! Murderer!

01:43:21.159 --> 01:43:22.911
I don't even wanna know.

01:43:37.259 --> 01:43:38.260
No!

01:43:38.427 --> 01:43:39.428
- No!
- No!

01:43:39.595 --> 01:43:41.388
She's breaking free!

01:43:41.555 --> 01:43:42.890
Hold her!

01:43:43.056 --> 01:43:45.475
Strange, take america's power!

01:43:51.315 --> 01:43:53.025
There's no other way.

01:43:53.984 --> 01:43:54.985
Yeah.

01:43:55.319 --> 01:43:56.778
This is the only way.

01:44:09.875 --> 01:44:12.503
It's me in other me's body.

01:44:16.256 --> 01:44:19.259
You're here to take my power, aren't you?

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:21.762
Before Wanda can.

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.806
It's okay.

01:44:25.766 --> 01:44:27.142
I understand now.

01:44:31.939 --> 01:44:34.149
No, america.

01:44:34.858 --> 01:44:37.319
I've come here to tell
you to trust yourself.

01:44:37.486 --> 01:44:39.071
Trust your power.

01:44:39.238 --> 01:44:41.240
That's how we stop her.

01:44:41.907 --> 01:44:43.408
I can't control it. I...

01:44:43.575 --> 01:44:45.577
Yes, you can.

01:44:45.744 --> 01:44:47.204
You have been all along.

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:52.668
Every time you opened a portal,
you sent us exactly where we needed to go.

01:44:54.503 --> 01:44:56.129
What about the first time?

01:44:56.296 --> 01:44:58.799
Even that led you to this moment...

01:45:00.759 --> 01:45:03.428
When you're gonna kick that witch's ass.

01:45:25.993 --> 01:45:27.077
I've got you.

01:46:17.169 --> 01:46:18.545
I can't beat you.

01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:22.090
So I'll give you what you want.

01:46:36.396 --> 01:46:38.482
Billy. Tommy.

01:46:38.899 --> 01:46:41.235
Mommy! It's the witch!

01:46:41.401 --> 01:46:42.861
What have you done?

01:46:43.111 --> 01:46:44.112
- Mom!
- Mommy!

01:46:44.279 --> 01:46:45.322
Wait! Boys!

01:46:45.489 --> 01:46:46.907
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

01:46:47.074 --> 01:46:48.200
I'm your mother!

01:46:50.619 --> 01:46:52.204
Get away from them.

01:46:53.372 --> 01:46:54.790
Mom!

01:46:55.249 --> 01:46:56.500
No.

01:46:56.667 --> 01:46:57.667
Not yet.

01:46:58.126 --> 01:46:59.336
Mommy!

01:46:59.503 --> 01:47:00.671
Get away from our mom!

01:47:00.838 --> 01:47:02.065
- You're not our real mom!
- Hey, boys. Stop.

01:47:02.089 --> 01:47:03.966
- Please. Please.
- Get out of our house!

01:47:04.132 --> 01:47:04.967
Boys, stop it.

01:47:05.133 --> 01:47:06.635
- You're not our mom!
- Get out!

01:47:06.802 --> 01:47:07.886
- Go away!
- Go!

01:47:08.053 --> 01:47:09.471
Stop it!

01:47:17.729 --> 01:47:19.773
Please don't hurt us.

01:47:20.148 --> 01:47:21.191
Please.

01:47:22.150 --> 01:47:23.944
I would never hurt you.

01:47:24.111 --> 01:47:25.112
Never.

01:47:26.864 --> 01:47:29.074
I would never hurt anyone.

01:47:29.241 --> 01:47:30.909
I'm not a monster.

01:47:31.076 --> 01:47:32.369
I'm a...

01:47:36.248 --> 01:47:37.291
I'm...

01:47:45.424 --> 01:47:46.425
I'm sorry.

01:47:54.433 --> 01:47:55.517
Mom!

01:47:55.684 --> 01:47:57.311
- Are you okay?
- Hi.

01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:59.605
Hi. Okay.

01:47:59.771 --> 01:48:00.772
I'm okay.

01:48:01.648 --> 01:48:04.276
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:48:15.996 --> 01:48:17.998
- Mom, don't go. Don't go.
- No, mom. Don't.

01:48:18.165 --> 01:48:19.165
- It's okay.
- Mom.

01:48:19.291 --> 01:48:21.084
It's okay. It's okay.

01:49:02.084 --> 01:49:04.294
Know that they'll be loved.

01:49:45.294 --> 01:49:46.295
What now?

01:49:46.461 --> 01:49:47.796
Get out of here.

01:49:48.547 --> 01:49:49.590
I'll find you.

01:49:58.515 --> 01:50:00.267
We have to go. Now!

01:50:12.738 --> 01:50:14.573
I opened the darkhold.

01:50:15.407 --> 01:50:17.576
I have to close it.

01:50:20.370 --> 01:50:23.415
No one will ever be tempted
by the darkhold again.

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.503
You all right?

01:51:10.170 --> 01:51:11.797
- Is it over?
- Yeah.

01:51:12.422 --> 01:51:13.632
Is america okay?

01:51:13.799 --> 01:51:15.759
She's on her way here to get us.

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.221
Wanda?

01:51:21.014 --> 01:51:22.015
No.

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.902
So she destroyed the darkhold
in every universe.

01:51:36.864 --> 01:51:38.448
She did the right thing.

01:51:40.409 --> 01:51:41.410
Yeah, she did.

01:51:49.376 --> 01:51:51.253
What's your universe like?

01:51:53.297 --> 01:51:54.715
It's very beautiful.

01:51:59.803 --> 01:52:01.471
I wish I could show you.

01:52:05.559 --> 01:52:06.894
I'd really like that.

01:52:11.982 --> 01:52:14.484
- But I have to go.
- Yeah.

01:52:15.736 --> 01:52:16.987
Yeah, I know.

01:52:20.741 --> 01:52:22.201
It's too bad, though.

01:52:24.453 --> 01:52:26.413
Could've been one hell of an incursion.

01:52:30.042 --> 01:52:31.251
I love you.

01:52:34.338 --> 01:52:37.049
I love you in every universe.

01:52:41.094 --> 01:52:44.389
It's not that I don't wanna care for
someone or have someone care for me.

01:52:44.556 --> 01:52:45.766
It's just...

01:52:49.102 --> 01:52:50.479
I get scared.

01:52:50.646 --> 01:52:51.647
Yeah.

01:52:54.733 --> 01:52:56.151
Yeah.

01:53:07.287 --> 01:53:08.497
Face your fears...

01:53:11.250 --> 01:53:13.168
Doctor strange.

01:53:43.824 --> 01:53:46.910
How is this so much harder
than a multiversal portal?

01:53:49.079 --> 01:53:51.415
She needs to slow down and be more patient.

01:53:53.041 --> 01:53:55.127
Reminds me of another student I knew.

01:53:57.629 --> 01:53:58.964
How you feeling?

01:53:59.590 --> 01:54:00.591
Why do you ask?

01:54:02.467 --> 01:54:05.512
You used the darkhold to dreamwalk
into your own corpse.

01:54:06.847 --> 01:54:08.182
Yeah, right, that.

01:54:09.183 --> 01:54:10.184
Fine.

01:54:12.519 --> 01:54:14.313
But I do wanna ask you something.

01:54:15.772 --> 01:54:17.232
Are you happy?

01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:20.444
That's a...

01:54:20.611 --> 01:54:21.737
Interesting question.

01:54:23.363 --> 01:54:26.116
You'd think that saving the world
would get you there...

01:54:26.783 --> 01:54:27.993
But it doesn't.

01:54:31.371 --> 01:54:35.459
Sometimes,
I do wonder about my other lives.

01:54:36.835 --> 01:54:39.296
Yet I remain grateful in this one.

01:54:40.297 --> 01:54:42.090
Even with its tribulations.

01:54:44.092 --> 01:54:46.762
At least we don't have to
go through it alone, huh?

01:54:46.929 --> 01:54:48.013
No, we don't.

01:55:00.150 --> 01:55:01.151
Wait.

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:04.571
'Sup?

01:55:04.738 --> 01:55:05.739
'Sup.

01:55:07.366 --> 01:55:08.367
Made some sparks.

01:55:08.992 --> 01:55:09.993
Great.

01:55:10.619 --> 01:55:14.289
Your parents would be proud.
I hope you'll get to show 'em one day.

01:55:15.374 --> 01:55:16.416
Stephen.

01:55:21.046 --> 01:55:23.340
I'm glad I fell into your universe.

01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:26.593
So am I, kid.

01:55:28.262 --> 01:55:29.972
So am I.

01:58:55.677 --> 01:58:57.012
Doctor strange?

01:59:00.432 --> 01:59:01.600
Can I help you?

01:59:02.267 --> 01:59:03.727
You caused an incursion...

01:59:03.894 --> 01:59:05.521
And we're gonna fix it.

01:59:14.238 --> 01:59:15.697
Unless you're afraid.

01:59:20.577 --> 01:59:21.870
Not in the least.

02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:14.700
It's over!
