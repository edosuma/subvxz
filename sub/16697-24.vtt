08:17.095 --> 08:18.597
You got Kenny
from work?

08:18.629 --> 08:19.632
Yeah. So what?

08:19.665 --> 08:21.233
Isn't he a little dim?

08:21.266 --> 08:24.737
No, he's a genius
I pay eight bucks
an hour to clean up.

08:25.737 --> 08:27.806
Hi, honey.

08:25.737 --> 08:27.806
Hi!

08:27.838 --> 08:29.742
Hello, there.
I'm here for...

08:29.774 --> 08:31.109
Yeah, yeah. The bird,
the bird, the bird.

08:31.142 --> 08:32.610
This one here.
Right here. See?

08:32.644 --> 08:34.279
Oh. That's her.

08:32.644 --> 08:34.279
Oh, yes!

08:34.312 --> 08:36.246
Look.

08:34.312 --> 08:36.246
Great.

08:36.280 --> 08:40.051
Well, perhaps a kiss
from the missus
and I'll be on my way.

08:42.053 --> 08:43.254
I named her Daphne.

08:43.288 --> 08:44.590
What do you call her?

08:44.623 --> 08:47.225
Oh. Um...
I call her Cheryl.

08:47.259 --> 08:49.228
That's my mom's name.

08:49.260 --> 08:52.030
Oh. I call her Gracie.

08:52.063 --> 08:53.598
That's my name.

08:53.631 --> 08:55.233
You don't know your
own bird's name?

08:55.267 --> 08:57.570
Hey, I got a lot
on my plate.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.706
Oh. Well, stranger,

09:00.739 --> 09:03.642
don't you think
it's time you
should move on?

09:03.674 --> 09:05.210
With your bird?

09:06.144 --> 09:07.580
(SQUAWKS)

09:06.144 --> 09:07.580
(EXCLAIMS)

09:07.613 --> 09:10.616
Wow. Jim,
you didn't tell me
it had a beak.

09:10.649 --> 09:14.019
I thought that was
implied when I said
it was a bird!

09:14.052 --> 09:15.354
You know
my daddy's name?

09:15.386 --> 09:17.288
JIM: Oh...

09:15.386 --> 09:17.288
Oh. No.

09:17.322 --> 09:19.291
Um, it's written
on his shirt.

09:19.323 --> 09:21.626
Yeah.

09:19.323 --> 09:21.626
That's says,
"Chicago Bears."

09:22.961 --> 09:24.229
She can read?

09:22.961 --> 09:24.229
Yes.

09:24.261 --> 09:26.297
Oh, man! That's it.
Game over, Jim.

09:26.331 --> 09:27.332
Easy, easy, easy!

09:27.365 --> 09:29.134
I knew it
wasn't your bird.

09:29.167 --> 09:31.036
You're a big liar!

09:31.068 --> 09:32.270
(DAPHNE CHIRPS)

09:33.772 --> 09:36.943
All liars!
I hate you!

09:38.342 --> 09:40.011
(SIGHS)

09:40.044 --> 09:41.746
So, how'd I do?

09:45.283 --> 09:47.286
Not so good, Kenny.

09:47.318 --> 09:48.386
Can I still
have my pickles?

09:48.419 --> 09:50.589
Pickles are for closers!

10:02.134 --> 10:04.235
Gracie? Sweetie,
let Mommy in.

10:04.269 --> 10:06.238
GRACIE: No!

10:06.270 --> 10:09.674
All right. Ruby,
open the door.

10:09.707 --> 10:12.043
I'm in here.
I don't like that bird.

10:14.446 --> 10:16.181
Did she lock it?

10:16.214 --> 10:17.850
Yeah. Oh, Jim,
we shouldn't
have done that.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.718
Now she's never
gonna trust us again.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.221
Yeah, well,
hindsight's always 24/7.

10:23.788 --> 10:25.790
Look, I think
you should take
the fall for this one.

10:25.823 --> 10:27.025
What?

10:25.823 --> 10:27.025
Come on.

10:27.058 --> 10:28.826
I've been the bad guy
the last four times.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.962
You were the bad guy
the last four times.

10:30.995 --> 10:32.264
Really?

10:30.995 --> 10:32.264
Yes.

10:32.297 --> 10:34.932
Well, would
a bad guy know
how to pick a lock?

10:34.966 --> 10:36.034
Yeah.

10:42.106 --> 10:43.741
Aw.

10:43.774 --> 10:47.379
Look at her.
With that little bird.

10:47.412 --> 10:49.381
She looks like
a tiny little
Bond villain.

10:49.413 --> 10:50.682
Yeah.

10:51.482 --> 10:53.184
Oh, sweetie.

10:53.217 --> 10:56.688
Oh, honey,
we are so sorry.

10:56.721 --> 11:00.158
It's just that
that bird was
driving us all crazy.

11:00.192 --> 11:01.894
But you lied.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.295
Yes, honey.

11:03.327 --> 11:07.031
Sometimes parents
do that because
the truth is just

11:07.065 --> 11:10.269
harder and it
takes more time.

11:10.302 --> 11:14.139
Yeah. And sometimes
mommies and daddies
make mistakes.

11:14.172 --> 11:16.008
And lying to you
was a big one.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.309
Big.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.309
Really?

11:17.341 --> 11:18.376
Yes.

11:19.510 --> 11:21.880
So is Grandpa
really sleeping?

11:23.347 --> 11:24.782
(SIGHS)

11:23.347 --> 11:24.782
No.

11:24.816 --> 11:26.018
No.

11:26.051 --> 11:27.920
Is thunder really
angels bowling?

11:27.952 --> 11:29.221
(CHUCKLES)

11:29.855 --> 11:30.889
No.

11:30.922 --> 11:32.191
Is Mommy really 29?

11:32.224 --> 11:33.259
Yes.

11:40.331 --> 11:41.866
That Dagwood!

11:41.899 --> 11:44.168
(LAUGHS) Oh,
the guy's got
a hot wife

11:44.201 --> 11:46.971
and all he can
think about is
giant sandwiches.

11:47.004 --> 11:51.076
Yeah. That would
never happen
in real life.

11:51.109 --> 11:53.378
She's gone.
Daphne's gone!

11:51.109 --> 11:53.378
What?

11:53.410 --> 11:55.446
I went upstairs
to get Daphne

11:55.480 --> 11:58.817
and the window
was open
and she's gone!

11:58.850 --> 12:00.085
You did it!

12:00.118 --> 12:02.221
You opened the window.
You hate her!

12:02.254 --> 12:05.490
I did not do that,
honey. I swear!

12:05.524 --> 12:06.958
Gracie!

12:06.991 --> 12:08.526
Cheryl!

12:06.991 --> 12:08.526
What?

12:08.559 --> 12:10.094
Leaving the window open?

12:10.128 --> 12:12.064
You didn't think
she'd get that?

12:12.096 --> 12:15.134
Me? Andy hates that
bird more than I do.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.502
Andy?

12:15.167 --> 12:16.502
Please.

12:16.534 --> 12:19.538
If I wanted that
bird gone, it'd be
deep-fried by now.

12:19.571 --> 12:22.841
Besides, I seem to
remember Dana leaving
windows open before.

12:22.874 --> 12:23.875
Dana?

12:23.908 --> 12:25.510
Oh, come on, you guys.
It's obvious.

12:25.543 --> 12:27.779
This has the stink
of Jim all over it!

12:27.812 --> 12:29.247
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

12:29.280 --> 12:31.849
Accusing the accuser?
I invented that dodge!

12:31.883 --> 12:33.252
You know it was you,
Dana. You know...

12:33.284 --> 12:35.453
All right, all right.
Stop it! Stop it!

12:35.486 --> 12:37.322
We're turning
on each other.

12:37.355 --> 12:40.526
Cheryl's right.
Don't you see it, guys?
Don't you see it?

12:40.558 --> 12:43.495
(WHISPERING)
This is exactly
what Gracie wants.

12:43.528 --> 12:44.562
She's trying
to split us up

12:44.596 --> 12:46.264
so she can take us
out one at a time.

12:46.298 --> 12:48.000
Oh.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.567
I wanna go
look for Daphne.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.403
All right, honey.
Well, just be
back by dinner.

12:51.436 --> 12:52.905
Oh, Jim!

12:52.937 --> 12:54.972
Sweetie, maybe Daphne
went to the park.

12:55.005 --> 12:56.507
Why don't you
and Daddy go
look together?

12:56.541 --> 12:58.010
Come on, Daddy. Hurry!

12:58.043 --> 12:59.378
(GROANING)
All right, all right.

12:59.410 --> 13:01.479
Sweetie, I'm right
behind you.

13:01.513 --> 13:03.248
Andy. Andy, come on.
You're coming with me.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.482
Why do I have to go?

13:04.515 --> 13:06.050
This is a complete
waste of time.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.919
You know we'll
never find that bird.

13:07.952 --> 13:09.420
Andy, I went
bar-hopping with you

13:09.453 --> 13:12.357
knowing full well you
wouldn't find a woman.

13:17.062 --> 13:19.565

13:19.597 --> 13:20.966

love the park.

fluffy cloud
of cotton candy,

in my bird lump.

13:40.885 --> 13:43.288
Daphne! Daphne!

13:43.321 --> 13:44.590
Daphne.

13:44.623 --> 13:45.958
Where is she, Daddy?

13:45.990 --> 13:48.092
Oh, Gracie,
I don't know.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.863
Come here, baby.

13:50.895 --> 13:52.330
Come over here.
You know what?

13:52.364 --> 13:55.600
We've been looking
for a whole hour.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.568
I don't think
Daphne's here.

13:57.601 --> 13:59.937
I mean, for all we know,
she could be in
Mexico right now.

13:59.971 --> 14:01.038
Mexico?

14:01.072 --> 14:03.341
JIM: Oh, yeah.
Birds love Mexico.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.612
(CHIRPS)

14:06.644 --> 14:10.048
It's sunny and warm
and they've got
peanut butter waterfalls.

14:10.615 --> 14:12.350
Birdseed beaches.

14:13.684 --> 14:16.087
Okay, that's not
quite the truth.

14:16.120 --> 14:19.091
But, if she's there,

14:19.124 --> 14:20.993
and I think she is,

14:21.025 --> 14:22.260
I'm sure she's
having a good time.

14:22.293 --> 14:23.461
Psst.

14:23.495 --> 14:24.596
What do you say
we go home?

14:23.495 --> 14:24.596

count the grass between
here and the rock?

And I'll give
you a nickel.

Oh, damn.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.593
Moments away from
a clean getaway.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.160
I hate that bird!

14:54.625 --> 14:56.160
Hey.

14:56.193 --> 14:58.229
I got an idea.
Okay, all I need

14:58.263 --> 15:00.365
is three dryer sheets,
a gallon of chocolate milk

15:00.398 --> 15:03.999
and a beekeeper's hat.

15:03.033 --> 15:04.403
What do you say
we just walk this way

15:04.436 --> 15:06.104
and maybe Gracie
will follow us?

15:06.136 --> 15:09.040
Well, if you wanna think
inside the box, sure.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.177
Wait.

15:12.711 --> 15:15.047
What?

15:15.080 --> 15:16.381
I can't lie
to Gracie again.

15:16.413 --> 15:17.481
What?

15:17.514 --> 15:19.016
I can't go.

15:19.049 --> 15:21.285
Jim! You're gonna
be stuck with
that bird forever.

15:21.318 --> 15:22.987
They live longer
than people, you know.

15:23.020 --> 15:25.089
I know.

15:25.123 --> 15:29.194
But look at her.
I can't hurt her again.
This is my daughter.

15:30.061 --> 15:31.163

15:33.063 --> 15:36.134

I'm as good a dad
as you are.

your arms and beat
you with them.

You'd better run.

was gonna be next.

Hurry, Daddy.
She'll get away!

it easy now.

You guys have
the worst luck
with that.

17:13.364 --> 17:14.732
I know.

17:14.766 --> 17:16.334
All right, Jim,
here's your ice pack.

17:16.366 --> 17:17.836
Oh, could you put it
under my tailbone?

17:17.867 --> 17:19.403
Yeah. Life's too short.

17:19.435 --> 17:21.137
(DAPHNE SQUAWKS)

17:19.435 --> 17:21.137
(ALL EXCLAIM)

17:21.172 --> 17:22.406
I can't
believe it.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.808
Why couldn't
a kitty have flown
into your head?

17:23.842 --> 17:26.111
I like kitties.

17:23.842 --> 17:26.111
Ow!

17:26.144 --> 17:27.612
Look at yourself.
You're losing it.

17:27.644 --> 17:29.614
We're playing right
into Gracie's hands.

17:29.646 --> 17:31.383
Oh.

17:29.646 --> 17:31.383
Oh, get off it.

17:32.182 --> 17:34.086
Look, Gracie's happy.

17:34.118 --> 17:35.686
And if she gets
bored of the bird
in a week,

17:35.720 --> 17:37.255
Dana can open
the window again.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.255
ANDY: Hmm.

17:37.288 --> 17:38.589
I told you.
It wasn't me.

17:38.623 --> 17:40.459
Oh, please.

17:38.623 --> 17:40.459
Mmm-hmm.

17:40.491 --> 17:42.359
Well, somebody
opened the window.
It didn't just...

17:42.393 --> 17:43.729
...open itself.

17:46.163 --> 17:47.665
I hate that bird!

17:49.733 --> 17:53.204
Oh, I'd yell at her
but my heart
wouldn't be in it.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.272
Hello?

17:54.305 --> 17:55.307
Uh, yeah?

17:55.339 --> 17:56.607
I'm Ginger Curran,

17:56.641 --> 17:57.808
and I believe
you met my husband Sean.

17:57.842 --> 17:59.111
Oh, yes. Hi!

17:57.842 --> 17:59.111
Hi.

17:59.144 --> 18:00.778
You still have
that bird?

18:00.811 --> 18:02.580
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

18:02.614 --> 18:05.182
Gracie, would you bring
Daphne down, please?

18:05.215 --> 18:07.585
Oh, I thought it
wasn't your bird?

18:07.618 --> 18:10.154
I know, I know.
But my wife's thinking
about spending $2000

18:10.188 --> 18:11.223
on another bird.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.459
So, I just...
Where's the bird?

18:13.892 --> 18:15.126
JIM: Gracie...

18:15.160 --> 18:16.695
Oh! Georgie!

18:16.728 --> 18:18.296
(EXCLAIMING)

18:18.328 --> 18:20.831
That's my Georgie!

18:20.865 --> 18:22.901
But it's not Georgie.

18:22.933 --> 18:24.402
It's Daphne.

18:24.434 --> 18:26.404
Oh, sweetie,
come here.

18:27.505 --> 18:29.741
Come here.
Oh, honey!

18:29.773 --> 18:32.276
I know you took really
good care of that bird.

18:32.309 --> 18:35.212
Oh, my little Georgie!

18:35.246 --> 18:38.250
I'll never let you out
of my sight again.

18:38.282 --> 18:39.750
Do I have to
give her back?

18:39.784 --> 18:41.186
ALL: Yes.

18:42.586 --> 18:43.622
Yeah.

18:43.654 --> 18:45.923
Mommy, can I say
goodbye to Daphne?

18:45.957 --> 18:47.759
Oh! Sure, sweetie.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.596
There you go.

18:52.630 --> 18:55.267
Oh, Daphne,
I love you.

18:55.299 --> 18:57.201
I don't want
you to go.

18:57.234 --> 18:59.471
So, we're
going to Mexico.

19:03.540 --> 19:07.244
Don't worry.
She doesn't
have a passport.

19:07.278 --> 19:08.480
Jim, bird's
in the tree.

19:08.512 --> 19:09.914
Would you
come out here?

19:08.512 --> 19:09.914
Ugh!

19:09.948 --> 19:11.817
I hate that bird.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.817
Yeah.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.393
Hey.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.393
Hey.

19:21.425 --> 19:22.760
What's up?

19:21.425 --> 19:22.760
Bird's gone again.

19:22.794 --> 19:23.929
No!

19:22.794 --> 19:23.929
You seen it?

19:23.961 --> 19:25.864
No.

19:25.896 --> 19:29.835
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Gracie
in a few days either.

19:33.503 --> 19:35.272
Aren't grown-ups stupid?

19:35.306 --> 19:36.575
(LAUGHING)

19:39.611 --> 19:41.413
(SIGHING CONTENTEDLY)
