WEBVTT

00:00.434 --> 00:03.102
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:03.104 --> 00:04.303
( screaming )

00:04.305 --> 00:05.571
Hanna:
<i> I SAW HIM IN THE WOODS.</i>

00:05.573 --> 00:06.939
<i> HE LEFT AN "A" MESSAGE.</i>

00:06.941 --> 00:08.140
Aria:<i> WHAT DID YOU SEE?</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:09.441
ENOUGH.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.709
NOEL KAHN IS "A."

00:10.711 --> 00:13.278
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYONE. PROMISE ME.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.047
YOUR MOTHER THINKS YOU'RE
KEEPING SOME KIND OF SECRET.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.548
I'M... GAY.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.584
Pam:<i> WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL US?</i>
SHE WAS AFRAID.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.085
<i> THIS IS WHAT</i>
<i> SHE'S AFRAID OF.</i>

00:20.087 --> 00:22.755
LUCAS, I AM BEING HONEST
WITH YOU. I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.656
AND I THINK YOU DESERVE
A BETTER BOYFRIEND.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.593
<i> SOMEBODY DECIDED TO PAY</i>
<i> A VISIT TO ALISON'S MEMORIAL.</i>

00:27.595 --> 00:31.296
MOM, THIS IS ALEX SANTIAGO.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.465
GOOD SERVE.
Veronica:<i> FROM THE CLUB.</i>

00:33.467 --> 00:35.134
I'M THE LAST POTTER.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.436
WHEN I GO, THAT'S
THE END OF THE LINE.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.340
WE'RE MARRIED.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.142
SPENCE, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

00:45.780 --> 00:46.979
WHO WROTE THAT?

00:46.981 --> 00:48.313
WHAT? WHAT'S ON THERE?

00:48.315 --> 00:49.982
GET IT OFF!
JUST WIPE IT OFF!

00:49.984 --> 00:51.617
GET IT OFF ME!

00:55.723 --> 00:57.389
WHY ARE YOU
TAKING THAT OFF?

00:57.391 --> 01:00.392
I'M NOT. I'M TRYING
TO KEEP IT ON.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.694
BELIEVE ME, I DON'T WANT
TO SEE THE AUTOGRAPH
THAT'S UNDER IT.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.163
WE CAN GET YOU
ANOTHER STICKER.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.698
THIS TIME, WHY DON'T YOU
TRY SOMETHING MELLOWER,

01:06.700 --> 01:08.834
LIKE "SAVE THE PLANET"?

01:08.836 --> 01:10.836
THERE WERE NOT
A LOT OF CHOICES, OKAY?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.838
IT WAS EITHER HUMPTY DUMPTY
OR "JESUS IS COMING.
LOOK BUSY."

01:15.976 --> 01:17.743
OH, GOD, IT'S STILL THERE.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.478
HANNA.
HANNA, DON'T, OKAY?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.946
DON'T LOOK AT THAT.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.615
JUST LOOK AROUND YOU,
'CAUSE YOU'RE SAFE,

01:23.617 --> 01:25.617
YOU'RE HOME,
AND YOU'RE ALIVE.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.487
I THOUGHT I WAS SAFE
IN MY HOSPITAL ROOM, TOO.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.389
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH NOEL KAHN?

01:30.391 --> 01:32.324
IS HE "A"?
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM?

01:32.326 --> 01:33.392
NO, I AVOID HIM.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.327
I KEEP TELLING HIM
I'M BUSY--

01:35.329 --> 01:37.663
BUSY FREAKING OUT
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT HIM.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.231
YEAH, WELL, TRY
BEING RUN OVER BY HIM.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.237
WHO GOT YOU THIS PANDA?

01:45.239 --> 01:46.405
SEAN?

01:46.407 --> 01:47.873
LUCAS.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.441
OH, SWEET.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.443
ANYONE ELSE STARVING,
OR IS IT JUST ME?

01:51.445 --> 01:53.745
YOUR MOM SAID SHE LEFT
A SPECIAL DINNER FOR YOU
IN THE FRIDGE.

01:53.747 --> 01:54.847
PASS.

01:54.849 --> 01:56.548
I WANT A POP-TART.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.016
WHAT?

01:58.018 --> 02:00.219
I'VE BEEN ON HOSPITAL FOOD
FOR THREE WEEKS.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.221
I WANT TO EAT SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
IT'S ALREADY BEEN CHEWED.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.690
WHY DON'T YOU EAT
WHILE WE GO GET
THE REST OF YOUR STUFF.

02:04.692 --> 02:05.657
'KAY?

02:45.533 --> 02:47.232
HANNA?

02:47.234 --> 02:50.202
HEY, SO, IF YOU'RE
GONNA STAY DOWN HERE TONIGHT,

02:50.204 --> 02:51.537
WE WERE, UM...

02:51.539 --> 02:52.504
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
DOWN HERE'S GOOD.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.972
WHAT HAPPENED?
NOTHIN'.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.108
JUST KNOCKED
A FEW BOXES DOWN.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.610
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN.

02:58.612 --> 03:02.514
UH, YOU CAN GO.
SERIOUSLY, MY MOM'S
GONNA BE HERE SOON.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.284
WAIT... SO NOW
YOU WANT US TO LEAVE?

03:05.286 --> 03:07.686
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON
A BRAVE FACE FOR US, OKAY?

03:07.688 --> 03:10.022
WE GET IT. IF BEING ALONE
IS FREAKING YOU OUT,

03:10.024 --> 03:12.357
WE CAN ABSOLUTELY
STAY AS LONG AS YOU...

03:12.359 --> 03:16.728
NO, NO, NO. I'M JUST--
I'M FUZZY, AND I THINK IT'S
FROM THIS PAIN MEDICATION.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.096
YEAH, I NEED A NAP.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.665
OKAY. CAN WE
HELP YOU TO THE COUCH?

03:19.667 --> 03:23.035
NO, YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.
SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS, GO.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.803
OKAY. CALL ME?

03:24.805 --> 03:25.837
YEAH.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.172
YEAH. ME, TOO, ANY TIME.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.843
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO
BOIL THAT FIRST, RIGHT?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.680
YEAH.
( chuckles )

03:36.283 --> 03:37.549
( door opens )

03:49.296 --> 03:50.963
( cell phone beeps )

04:05.179 --> 04:06.411
The Pierces:
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET ¶</i>

04:06.413 --> 04:07.980
<i> ¶ CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

04:07.982 --> 04:10.015
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

04:10.017 --> 04:12.551
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

04:12.553 --> 04:15.187
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

04:15.189 --> 04:17.155
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

04:17.157 --> 04:20.492
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

04:20.494 --> 04:22.527
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

04:22.529 --> 04:24.529
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

04:27.468 --> 04:29.268
SO, DO YOU LIKE?

04:29.270 --> 04:31.637
I COULD GO BACK
AND GET THE ONE WITH
A BUILT-IN HEATING PAD.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.006
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE NO-SPENDING ZONE?

04:34.008 --> 04:36.708
HONEY, YOU ARE GONNA BE
ON THE COUCH A LOT.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.543
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
BE COMFORTABLE.

04:38.545 --> 04:41.713
LAST MONTH, WE COULD
BARELY AFFORD BASIC CABLE
AND BUBBLE BATH,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.282
AND NOW YOU'RE...

04:43.284 --> 04:44.716
I TOLD YOU,
THINGS ARE BETTER NOW.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.884
THE BANK LOAN CAME THROUGH.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.220
IN A LASAGNA BOX?

04:59.967 --> 05:02.868
AS I SEE, YOU'VE HAD
TIME TO GO EXPLORING
WHILE I WAS OUT.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.203
MOM, THERE ARE THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS IN THERE.

05:05.205 --> 05:08.707
HANNA...

05:08.709 --> 05:11.510
WE WERE DAYS AWAY
FROM A FORECLOSURE.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.745
WHERE'D IT COME FROM?
THE BANK.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.415
IT<i> IS</i> A LOAN.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.649
UNAUTHORIZED.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.451
YEAH, BUT WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.520
IT MEANS JUST WHAT I SAID.
I BORROWED IT,

05:21.522 --> 05:24.022
FROM A CUSTOMER WHO WILL
NEVER KNOW IT WAS BORROWED

05:24.024 --> 05:26.224
BECAUSE IT'S
ALL GONNA BE REPLACED
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.759
SO YOU<i> STOLE</i> IT?

05:27.761 --> 05:30.862
LISTEN TO ME.
THIS IS OUR LIFELINE.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.531
I WAS ABLE TO GET
OUR MORTGAGE CURRENT,

05:32.533 --> 05:34.599
AND WHAT'S LEFT IN THIS BOX
IS OUR CUSHION.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.736
AND I WILL PAY IT ALL BACK.
ALL OF IT.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.770
HOW?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.275
MOM?

05:47.448 --> 05:51.483
I NEVER INTENDED FOR
YOU TO KNOW ABOUT IT.
THAT'S WHY I HID IT.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.286
I FIGURED IN A BOX OF CARBS
THAT'S BEEN SITTING UP THERE
UNTOUCHED FOR 10 YEARS

05:54.288 --> 05:56.655
WAS A SAFER BET
THAN MY OLD MAKEUP BAG.
MY MISTAKE.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.323
THIS IS MY PROBLEM.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.592
YOU JUST NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT GETTING BETTER, OKAY?

06:00.594 --> 06:02.928
OKAY. I'M GONNA
TAKE A SHOWER.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.122
I LIKE THESE SAUSAGES.
WHAT ARE THEY, CHICKEN?

06:30.124 --> 06:31.356
NO, THEY'RE TURKEY.

06:31.358 --> 06:34.626
SO, DOES YOUR FRIEND
HAVE ANY ALLERGIES?

06:34.628 --> 06:36.128
WHAT?

06:36.130 --> 06:38.597
IS THERE ANYTHING I SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT WHAT MAYA EATS?

06:38.599 --> 06:41.266
NO. SHE EATS EVERYTHING.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.713
Dad, I know I asked for it,

06:54.715 --> 06:56.882
but if Mom can't handle
this dinner tonight,

06:56.884 --> 06:58.950
I'll just tell Maya...
We're looking forward to it.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.420
Your mother was up all last
night preparing the menu.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.188
You don't think she'll try
and poison her, do you?

07:03.190 --> 07:06.358
( chuckles )
Your mother?

07:06.360 --> 07:08.026
That's not her style.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.795
She'd kill her
with kindness.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.633
<i> ¶ COME HERE ¶</i>

07:14.635 --> 07:17.035
<i> ¶ I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,</i>
<i> BIG BABY ¶</i>

07:17.037 --> 07:19.838
GET IN.
I CAN'T.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.908
MY MOM WILL BE OUT
ANY SECOND.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.477
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA BELIEVE
THAT YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY
JUST FOR COFFEE.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.345
WELL, I DIDN'T.
I CAME FOR THE KISS.

07:32.019 --> 07:32.884
OH.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.756
LET'S DO THIS LATER.
YEAH.

07:37.758 --> 07:38.723
OKAY.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.429
NO, HONEY, LEAVE
THE BOXES THERE FOR NOW.

07:44.431 --> 07:47.899
DO NOT CALL HER.
IT'S THEIR HONEYMOON.

07:47.901 --> 07:51.069
OKAY. BYE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:51.071 --> 07:54.406
IAN HAD ALL HIS BOXES
DELIVERED THIS MORNING
FROM HIS STORAGE UNIT.

07:54.408 --> 07:56.341
IT COULDN'T WAIT
TILL THEY GOT BACK?

07:56.343 --> 07:57.943
I'M GUESSING HE AND MELISSA

07:57.945 --> 07:59.744
PROBABLY WANT TO GET
A JUMPSTART ON SETTLING IN.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.114
WHY ARE YOU SO SHOCKED?

08:03.116 --> 08:05.283
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

08:05.285 --> 08:08.887
YOU AND DAD ARE ACTING
AS IF YOU'RE TOTALLY OKAY
WITH THIS WHOLE ELOPEMENT THING.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.255
YOU DON'T THINK
THIS WAS RUSHED?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.591
OF COURSE IT'S RUSHED.
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.392
I'M NOT
DANCING A JIG OVER IT,

08:14.394 --> 08:16.461
BUT WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.263
BESIDES, A LONG ENGAGEMENT
DOESN'T GUARANTEE WEDDED
BLISS EITHER.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.499
OH, HONEY,
WOULD YOU HOLD THIS?
I'M BUZZING.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.102
OH, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.939
IAN?
MNH. MELISSA.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.275
ANOTHER PICTURE.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.776
THE HONEYMOONERS.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.144
WHERE ARE THEY?

08:33.146 --> 08:35.146
LOOKS LIKE THAT MALL
NEAR DAD'S OFFICE.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.215
I GUESS WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE,
YOU CAN BE ANYWHERE.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.152
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD,

08:41.154 --> 08:43.955
MELISSA TRADING IN
HER PRINCESS GOWN
AND PINK CHAMPAGNE

08:43.957 --> 08:45.790
FOR A FOOD COURT SLURPEE?

08:45.792 --> 08:48.793
SPENCER, YOU WERE
A BIG PART OF YOUR
SISTER'S ROUGH YEAR.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.562
MAYBE YOU COULD JUST
BE HAPPY FOR HER.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.773
WHY IS HE OUT OF JAIL?

09:01.775 --> 09:03.775
HE'S OUT ON BAIL.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.410
HE'S PROBABLY MEETING
WITH HIS ATTORNEY.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.179
HONEY, YOU'LL BE LATE,

09:08.181 --> 09:11.049
AND STARING AT HIM
WON'T MAKE HIM DISAPPEAR.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.083
COME ON. LET'S GO.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.656
OOH. MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST GIVE HER ONE BOOK
AT A TIME.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.824
HANNA DOESN'T REALLY
DO WELL WITH STACKS--

09:19.826 --> 09:22.227
UNLESS THEY'RE CATALOGUES.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.362
HI, MAYA.
HEY THERE.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.698
ARE YOU STILL COMING
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

09:26.700 --> 09:29.634
SURE, IF YOUR FOLKS
STILL WANT ME TO.
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?

09:29.636 --> 09:31.503
ANYTHING. DOESN'T MATTER.

09:31.505 --> 09:32.837
A DRESS.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.640
A DRESS?
( laughs )
SERIOUSLY?

09:35.642 --> 09:38.310
IS THIS SOME SORT OF
FORMAL THINGY,

09:38.312 --> 09:41.279
OR ARE YOU JUST WORRIED
MY JEANS ARE TOO BUTCH?

09:41.281 --> 09:43.782
DON'T SAY THINGS
LIKE THAT, PLEASE, OKAY?

09:43.784 --> 09:47.085
THEY'RE NOT--
THEY WON'T LAUGH.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.254
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
LATER, SO,

09:49.256 --> 09:50.922
HAVE FUN TONIGHT,
BUT, FYI,

09:50.924 --> 09:52.791
IF YOU DECIDE TO WEAR JEANS,
IRON THEM.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.803
EMILY...

10:04.805 --> 10:06.738
ARE YOU STILL
INTO THIS DINNER?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.940
OF COURSE.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.942
I JUST...

10:10.944 --> 10:12.944
( sighs ) MY PARENTS
HAVE BEEN ACTING STRANGE

10:12.946 --> 10:15.347
SINCE I TOLD THEM
ABOUT ME.

10:15.349 --> 10:16.514
US.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.249
DEFINE "STRANGE."

10:18.251 --> 10:21.219
WHISPERING, CLOSING DOORS,

10:21.221 --> 10:23.121
CHANGING THE CHANNEL
WHEN<i> ELLEN</i> COMES ON.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.489
GOT IT.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.025
I WILL WEAR
THE GIRLIEST DRESS I OWN.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.894
I'LL TELL THEM
I SEWED IT MYSELF.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.364
MAYA, THIS ISN'T A JOKE.

10:32.366 --> 10:36.167
MY MOM ISN'T YOUR MOM, OKAY?

10:36.169 --> 10:39.004
<i> GATSBY...</i>

10:39.006 --> 10:41.006
WAS MORE THAN JUST
A PRETTY FACE.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.743
HE WAS AMBITIOUS,
RUTHLESS, CHARMING,

10:44.745 --> 10:46.311
AND THE THEMES
OF CHANGE AND LOSS

10:46.313 --> 10:48.413
ARE CENTRAL TO BOTH NOVELS.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.415
DID EVERYBODY GET
THEIR PAPERS BACK?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.584
( bell rings )
PERFECT!

10:52.586 --> 10:54.419
SEE YOU WEDNESDAY.

10:54.421 --> 10:58.023
OH, CHAPTERS ONE AND FOUR.
NO STUDY GUIDES, PLEASE.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.758
READ THE MAN, NOT THE BLOGGER.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.893
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.461
I'LL GET HANNA'S ASSIGNMENT
AND MEET UP WITH YOU.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.374
I KNOW WHO WROTE THAT
MESSAGE ON YOUR CAR.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.845
It was Noel Kahn.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.048
But he admitted
it was stupid.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.249
He was just angry
and jealous.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.817
Yeah, I get why he did it.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.185
Who else knows?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.688
Nobody.
Nobody else knows.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.357
Look, and he's
not gonna tell anyone.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.892
How do you know that?

11:35.796 --> 11:38.997
Because... I think
he may have known
about us

11:38.999 --> 11:40.498
for a while now,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.467
but if he was
trying to hurt us,

11:42.469 --> 11:44.803
he would have said something
a long time ago.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.972
But he promised he'd
just forget what he saw.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.809
Look, let's not talk
about this here.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.080
Can I come
to your place later?

11:58.919 --> 12:01.453
I'M JUST NOT SURE
<i> I</i> WANT TO BE THERE.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.021
IT'LL BE FINE.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.691
JUST... MAKE SURE MAYA
DOESN'T DO ALL THE TALKING.

12:06.693 --> 12:10.028
IF SHE STARTS
GOING OVER A CLIFF,
YOU GRAB THE WHEEL.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.663
SPENCER, EMILY,
WAIT UP.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.665
I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT HANNA'S MOM'S GOT

12:13.667 --> 12:15.333
SOME BANK THINGY
IN SCRANTON

12:15.335 --> 12:17.402
AND WON'T BE HOME
TILL REALLY LATE, SO...

12:17.404 --> 12:19.070
I WANT TO DO
A SURPRISE PARTY.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.538
YOU KNOW,
"WELCOME HOME, HANNA.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.173
WE LOVE YOU, WITH
OR WITHOUT YOUR SPLEEN."

12:22.175 --> 12:23.842
I'VE CHECKED WITH MR. HANNA,

12:23.844 --> 12:25.877
AND SEAN IS TOTALLY
DOWN WITH IT.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.713
THEY... DIDN'T TAKE OUT
HER SPLEEN.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.582
REALLY? OH.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.784
THEN I'LL JUST
CHANGE THE THEME.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.252
MONA...

12:34.254 --> 12:36.421
I'M REALLY NOT SURE
HANNA'S UP TO HOSTING

12:36.423 --> 12:39.023
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
AT A PARTY.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.026
OH, PLEASE. SHE'S BEEN
SOCIALIZING WITH I.V. BAGS
AND BEDPANS.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.762
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.397
IF YOU GUYS
DON'T WANT TO COME,
I'M SURE SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.773
MR. FITZ?

12:54.775 --> 12:56.374
GOT A SECOND?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.143
UH... SURE.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.544
WHAT'S UP, NOEL?

12:59.546 --> 13:01.379
WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.848
THESE COMMENTS
ON MY PAPER.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.550
PRETTY HARSH.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.786
OH. I WASN'T TRYING TO BE.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.921
I WORKED
REALLY HARD ON THIS.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.756
I'M SURE YOU DID,

13:11.758 --> 13:14.626
BUT YOU CLEARLY HADN'T
READ ALL THE MATERIAL.

13:14.628 --> 13:18.396
I THINK I KNOW... ENOUGH...

13:18.398 --> 13:20.031
TO GET A BETTER GRADE
THAN THIS.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.238
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO DO, NOEL?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.073
CHANGE THE GRADE?

13:29.075 --> 13:31.576
'CAUSE THAT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.578
MR. FITZ,

13:33.580 --> 13:35.880
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO BRING
THE PRINCIPAL INTO THIS,
DO YOU?

13:38.051 --> 13:41.686
TAKE ANOTHER READ.
YOU MAY HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.354
I THINK IT DESERVES THIS.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.577
HEY THERE.

14:05.579 --> 14:08.379
TURNS OUT THERE'S THIS
SURPRISE PARTY FOR HANNA,

14:08.381 --> 14:11.549
SO I'M THINKING, UM,
I'LL JUST GO THERE FIRST
AND THEN COME BY.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.884
YOU'RE NOT COMING OVER.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.252
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

14:14.254 --> 14:17.055
I HAD A VISIT FROM
YOUR FRIEND NOEL.

14:17.057 --> 14:20.358
TURNS OUT HE'S NOT TOO GOOD
AT KEEPING PROMISES.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.561
In fact, he's not at<i> all</i>
who you think he is.

14:23.563 --> 14:26.130
DID HE SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?

14:26.132 --> 14:27.031
EZRA.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.801
HEY.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.803
TELL ME WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:31.805 --> 14:33.304
MAYBE I CAN FIX IT.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.672
Jenna: MR. FITZ.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.978
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, JENNA?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.347
MR. MAZARRA SAID YOU NEED
TO SIGN MY ABSENCE CARD.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.684
SURE. LET ME...
LET ME GET A PEN.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.497
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.999
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.343
Spencer: HEY.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.512
HEY!
HEY, I'M SORRY.
PRACTICE RAN LATE.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.983
WHAT'S THIS?

15:18.985 --> 15:20.184
MEMBER OF THE CLUB
GAVE IT TO ME.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.987
IT'S A TENNIS CLINIC
IN SWEDEN.

15:22.989 --> 15:25.290
SWEDEN? WHY DID HE
GIVE IT TO YOU?

15:25.292 --> 15:27.225
HE WANTS ME TO APPLY.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.993
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO
GO TO IT END UP PLAYING
IN THE SWEDISH OPEN.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.496
ALEX, THAT'S AMAZING!
YOU HAVE TO DO IT!

15:31.498 --> 15:33.298
MAYBE I COULD GET
AN INTERNSHIP OVER THERE,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.799
LIKE IN STOCKHOLM
OR SOMETHING.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.901
SPENCER, SLOW DOWN.
I'M NOT GOING.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.903
WHY? IF THIS GUY
RECOMMENDED YOU,

15:38.905 --> 15:40.905
HE MUST THINK
YOU'RE UP TO IT.

15:40.907 --> 15:44.375
I THINK YOU'RE UP TO IT.
YOU ARE FANTASTIC.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.877
I CAN'T GO.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.712
I TOLD MY UNCLE
I'D WORK FOR HIM.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.547
HE NEEDS THE BODIES.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.216
YOUR UNCLE CAN FIND
OTHER BODIES TO HELP HIM
RIP DOWN BUILDINGS.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.285
THIS IS A ONCE-IN-
A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.820
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.489
SO YOU'D RATHER SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR SUMMER

15:58.491 --> 16:00.959
TOSSING BROKEN PLASTER
IN A DUMPSTER?

16:00.961 --> 16:02.293
THAT'S INSANE.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.795
MAYBE TO YOU.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.630
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN PLAYING PRO.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.633
I'D RATHER BE HERE,
WORKING, SAVING FOR COLLEGE.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.570
OKAY, I GET THAT,
AND THAT'S GOOD, BUT...

16:12.572 --> 16:14.572
HOW CAN YOU TURN THIS DOWN?

16:14.574 --> 16:16.074
LIKE THIS.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.145
SO, YOU READY?

16:23.750 --> 16:24.949
<i> SO...</i>

16:24.951 --> 16:27.118
WHERE IN TEXAS
WILL YOU BE STATIONED?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.387
FORT HOOD. BUT I'M
NOT LEAVING JUST YET.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.724
( laughs )
OH, UM... NO, THANK YOU.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.826
I DON'T EAT SEAFOOD.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.229
IT'S NOT A MORAL THING.
I GET HIVES.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.499
OH. I'M SORRY.
EMILY SAID THAT YOU
COULD EAT ANYTHING, SO...

16:41.501 --> 16:43.067
I FORGOT. Sorry.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.069
IT'S OKAY. UM...

16:45.071 --> 16:46.838
I'M<i> REALLY</i> SORRY.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.506
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S FINE.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.442
ARE BOTH YOUR FOLKS
FROM CALIFORNIA, MAYA?

16:51.444 --> 16:53.378
YEAH. THEY, UH...

16:53.380 --> 16:55.513
THEY MET IN BERKLEY
AT A NO-NUKES RALLY.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.282
AFTER MY BROTHER
AND I CAME ALONG,

16:58.284 --> 17:01.252
THEY GOT MARRIED,
AND WE MOVED TO SAN JOSE.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.888
SO YOU WERE ALREADY HERE
WHEN YOUR PARENTS
GOT MARRIED?

17:03.890 --> 17:05.556
I WAS THE FLOWER GIRL.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.261
OH, UM, I GUESS THEY WANTED
TO MAKE SURE IT WAS REAL

17:10.263 --> 17:12.697
BEFORE THEY TIED THE KNOT.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.366
TWO CHILDREN
WASN'T REAL ENOUGH?

17:15.368 --> 17:18.403
UM... TELL THE STORY OF
HOW YOUR DAD ASKED YOUR MOM.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.771
( laughs )

17:19.773 --> 17:25.043
SO, MY DAD'S THIS RAGING,
CRAZY ROMANTIC.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.678
HE PROPOSED TO MY MOM
WITH A SHARPIE.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.216
OH, HE DIDN'T HAVE A RING,

17:32.218 --> 17:35.186
SO HE DREW ONE ON HER FINGER
WITH A FELT PEN.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.788
( laughs )

17:36.790 --> 17:38.956
THAT'S A VERY CLEVER
PLACEHOLDER.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.558
NO, THAT'S THE ONLY ONE
SHE'S EVER HAD.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.394
ONCE THE INK WORE OFF,
SHE RETRACED IT
WITH A TATTOO.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.296
( chuckling )

17:45.298 --> 17:47.698
WOW. SEE, NOW WHY
DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?

17:47.700 --> 17:50.735
EXCUSE ME WHILE I CHECK
ON THE ROAST.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.237
AND HONEY, BE CAREFUL.
OUR ANNIVERSARY
IS COMING UP.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.074
I'M GONNA INVEST IN
SOME FELT-TIP MARKERS.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.475
( chuckles )

18:22.135 --> 18:24.202
( sobbing quietly )

18:40.820 --> 18:43.087
SO, WHERE YOU GOING
AFTER THIS?

18:43.089 --> 18:45.223
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:45.225 --> 18:47.758
WELL, WHEN MY MOM TOLD ME
YOU WERE GONNA GIVE UP
YOUR FRIDAY NIGHT

18:47.760 --> 18:49.360
TO HELP ME STUDY MATH...

18:49.362 --> 18:51.963
I NEVER SAID MATH.
I SAID I WOULD GET YOU
UP TO SPEED.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.066
SO... CAN WE DISCUSS
CLAUDIA RICE?

18:55.068 --> 18:56.501
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.703
YES, YOU DO.
SKINNY, SKINNY JEANS.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.471
WON'T WEAR ANYTHING
UNLESS IT'S TIGHT ENOUGH

19:00.473 --> 19:01.939
TO MAKE BLOOD COME
OUT OF HER EARS.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.376
WHOA, WHAT WAS THAT?

19:05.378 --> 19:06.978
WHAT WAS WHAT?

19:06.980 --> 19:09.280
I JUST SAW A SHADOW
AT YOUR DOOR.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.050
NO, WAIT, MONA,
DON'T OPEN THE DOOR.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.452
CALL THE POLICE.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.621
OH, HUSH, BABY JANE.
MONA, DON'T!

19:16.623 --> 19:17.855
( door opens )

19:17.857 --> 19:20.625
All: SURPRISE!

19:20.627 --> 19:23.261
( laughter
and happy chatter )

19:37.143 --> 19:38.910
<i> ¶ OOH ¶</i>

19:38.912 --> 19:40.411
<i> ¶ IN MY HEAD, IN MY HEAD ¶</i>

19:40.413 --> 19:41.946
<i> ¶ I WAS MOVIN' ¶</i>

19:41.948 --> 19:43.214
<i> ( indistinct lyric )</i>

19:48.555 --> 19:50.288
( music and chatter )

20:01.401 --> 20:03.301
UH, NOEL, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.770
PLEASE DON'T OPEN THAT.

20:05.772 --> 20:06.604
JACKPOT.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.778
THAT'S IT, NOEL!
WE'RE<i> OVER!</i>

20:13.780 --> 20:14.745
WHAT?

20:20.253 --> 20:22.620
HAPPY NOW?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.789
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:24.791 --> 20:26.757
I JUST PUT NOEL KAHN
BACK ON THE MARKET.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.960
HOW?
YOU BROKE THEM UP?

20:28.962 --> 20:30.795
<i> WE</i> BROKE THEM UP.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.496
AREN'T YOU STILL
CRUSHING ON HIM, ARIA?

20:32.498 --> 20:34.899
WHAT DID "WE" DO,
ALISON?

20:34.901 --> 20:37.468
WHAT'S WITH THE 'TUDE, GUYS?

20:37.470 --> 20:39.904
I DID IT FOR ARIA.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.372
I ONLY KILL
WHEN WE NEED FOOD.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.976
AND WHEN I'M BORED.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.147
<i> BUONA SERA.</i>

20:50.149 --> 20:51.649
HEY, LUCAS.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.384
LONG TIME, NO TALK.
HOW ARE YOU?

20:53.386 --> 20:54.752
THIRSTY.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.887
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN CUP.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.523
SO... WERE YOU SURPRISED?

20:59.525 --> 21:01.359
YEAH. I STILL AM.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.194
DID YOU GET MY E-MAILS?

21:03.196 --> 21:04.295
YEAH, I GOT 'EM.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.333
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M BEHIND IN EVERY CLASS,

21:09.335 --> 21:11.135
SO, IF YOU WANT TO
STUDY TOGETHER...

21:11.137 --> 21:12.837
I'M KIND OF OFF STUDYING
AT THE MOMENT.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.839
BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.

21:14.841 --> 21:18.643
THIS SEMESTER, I PLAN
TO GO FROM HONOR ROLL
TO TOILET ROLL.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.278
WHAT IS THIS?

21:20.280 --> 21:23.481
YEAH, I WOULD
SLOW DOWN ON THAT.
MONA MADE THAT, SO...

21:23.483 --> 21:24.682
I'M FINE, MOM.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.150
I'M NOT DRIVING,

21:26.152 --> 21:28.419
AND THIS ISN'T MY FIRST TIME
PLAYING MARGARITAVILLE.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.187
WANT SOME?

21:30.189 --> 21:33.190
HANNA-BANANA,
WHERE IS THAT PHOTO
OF YOU AND ME AT THE LAKE?

21:33.192 --> 21:35.259
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WHERE
WE WON THE CHICKEN FIGHT.

21:35.261 --> 21:38.229
I DON'T REMEMBER, SEAN.
SURE YOU DO.

21:38.231 --> 21:40.197
IT'S YOU AND SEAN.
( imitates Tarzan yell )

21:40.199 --> 21:43.601
ME TARZAN, YOU JANE AUSTEN.

21:43.603 --> 21:44.802
YOU GOT A PROBLEM?

21:44.804 --> 21:47.038
NOPE. MNH-MNH.
JUST AMUSING MYSELF.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.715
DID I EMBARRASS YOU?

21:57.717 --> 22:00.685
SORRY, ABOUT
THE SHRIMP THING.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.720
HAD I EATEN THAT,
I WOULD HAVE BLOWN UP.

22:02.722 --> 22:03.888
STOP.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.723
THEY REALLY LIKED YOU.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.459
DAD WAS DEFINITELY HOOKED,
AND MOM LIKED THE DRESS.

22:08.461 --> 22:11.128
WAIT TILL SHE SEES
THE CREASE IN MY JEANS.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.630
( both chuckle )

22:12.632 --> 22:14.598
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE
BEFORE WE GO TO HANNA'S?

22:14.600 --> 22:16.534
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I BAILED ON THAT?

22:16.536 --> 22:18.969
I'M EXHAUSTED.
I DIDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.238
I WAS WAY TOO NERVOUS.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.240
ABOUT DINNER?

22:23.242 --> 22:25.743
BECAUSE WHEN I SAW YOU
AT SCHOOL, YOU WERE
TOTALLY ALL RIGHT.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.078
ONE OF US
HAD TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.914
YOU WERE ONE BUCKLE
SHORT OF A STRAITJACKET.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.549
( chuckles )

22:36.622 --> 22:39.023
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.026
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
AND GIVE MAYA SOMETHING
TO TAKE TO HER FOLKS.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.262
THAT'S SO SWEET.
THANK YOU.

22:45.264 --> 22:46.163
YOU'RE WELCOME.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.937
ENJOY.
THANK YOU.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.274
HERE YOU GO.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.276
THANKS.

22:59.278 --> 23:02.780
SO, UM, I WAS THINKING--

23:02.782 --> 23:05.616
MY PARENTS HAVE
THIS LITTLE PLACE
UP IN BUCKS COUNTY.

23:05.618 --> 23:09.086
WHAT IF WE, UH,
COULD SNEAK AWAY
UP THERE NEXT WEEKEND?

23:09.088 --> 23:12.356
PLEASE JUST DON'T SAY NO
UNTIL I AT LEAST SHOW YOU
A PICTURE.

23:12.358 --> 23:13.824
YOU HAD ME AT
"I WAS THINKING."

23:26.339 --> 23:28.639
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.975
NOTHING. I JUST--

23:30.977 --> 23:34.145
JUST A LITTLE BIT BUSY,
HERE.

23:34.147 --> 23:37.148
WELL, LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

23:37.150 --> 23:38.949
OKAY. I'LL MEET YOU
OUT THERE.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.619
I'M JUST GONNA GO UPSTAIRS
AND USE THE BATHROOM.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.586
OKAY.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.301
THERE YOU ARE!
WHERE YOU BEEN?

23:57.303 --> 23:59.904
SEAN GOT THIS AMAZING
PICTURE OF HANNA'S FACE
WHEN WE SURPRISED HER.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.406
SHE MIGHT
HAVE PEED HERSELF.
IT WAS CLASSIC.

24:02.408 --> 24:04.308
You broke your promise.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.010
You promised me you'd
forget what you saw

24:06.012 --> 24:08.145
in Mr. Fitz's car,
but you're not
letting it go.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.981
Back up. What are we
talking about?

24:10.983 --> 24:13.818
You know<i> exactly</i> what
I'm talking about, okay?

24:13.820 --> 24:15.619
And you can't just
blackmail him...!

24:15.621 --> 24:19.223
Blackmail?
Is that what he said?

24:19.225 --> 24:20.658
You never demanded
a better grade?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.827
I didn't<i> demand</i> anything.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.862
I asked him to take
a second look at my essay.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.597
I mean, haven't you
ever worked hard

24:26.599 --> 24:28.098
and thought you deserved
something better than
what you got?

24:29.836 --> 24:31.435
Wow.

24:31.437 --> 24:32.870
If that's the story
he put out there,

24:32.872 --> 24:34.538
then you've really got
to wonder who this guy is.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.843
Noel...

24:38.845 --> 24:41.378
is there something else
going on here?

24:41.380 --> 24:44.215
Is there some old grudge
you've got against me
and my friends?

24:44.217 --> 24:45.683
NOEL,
COME CHECK THIS OUT.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.018
PRITZKER'S GOT THIS VIDEO
OF THE BARRACUDA GAME.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.053
IT'S YOUR
SHINING MOMENT, DUDE.

25:09.342 --> 25:12.042
DID JENNA TELL YOU
I TRIED TO REACH YOU,

25:12.044 --> 25:13.777
WHEN YOU WERE STILL IN JAIL?

25:13.779 --> 25:15.145
NO.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.848
WELL, I DID.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.518
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I WASN'T THE ONE.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.786
I NEVER TOLD THE POLICE
WHERE YOU WERE.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.026
I GOTTA GO.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.394
WHERE?

25:32.798 --> 25:35.366
THERE'S A-A PARTY
AT HANNA'S.

25:35.368 --> 25:38.035
LUCKY YOU.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.838
I CAN BARELY LEAVE MY PORCH.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.510
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

25:46.512 --> 25:49.914
I DON'T GET
MANY INVITATIONS.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.348
JUST DEATH THREATS.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.524
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

26:00.526 --> 26:03.160
THAT'S WHAT I ASKED YOU,

26:03.162 --> 26:04.762
BEFORE THE COPS PICKED ME UP.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.767
I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER EITHER.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.424
( happy chatter )

26:33.426 --> 26:34.858
HEY, HOLD STILL.

26:40.433 --> 26:44.702
Look, would you be cool
if I left a little early?

26:44.704 --> 26:46.003
Now?

26:46.005 --> 26:48.238
Where you going?
Hot faculty party?

26:49.875 --> 26:51.442
It was a joke.

26:51.444 --> 26:52.810
Was it?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.078
Aria.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.080
No, it bothers you,
me and Ezra. I can...

26:56.082 --> 26:58.716
I can tell by the way
you're looking at me.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.785
I mean, come on.
It's not like things
aren't different now.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.588
Parties like this
must feel like
you're babysitting.

27:04.590 --> 27:06.290
Wh--? I don't
feel like that at all.

27:08.094 --> 27:11.228
I-I never should have
told you guys.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.164
No, you<i> should</i> have
told us a long time ago,
when it started.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.400
I mean, this whole time,
I thought I was helping you

27:16.402 --> 27:17.901
get over this
Viking boy in Iceland

27:17.903 --> 27:19.536
who, turns out,
doesn't exist.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.238
I mean, I thought
we were close.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.140
We tell each other
everything.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.644
I couldn't. I swore to Ezra
that he could trust me.

27:26.646 --> 27:27.978
Well, we trusted you too.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.515
Right.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.250
And now I've blown it
with everyone.

27:37.623 --> 27:40.658
IT TOOK FOREVER
TO GET INTO THAT BATHROOM.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.727
MONA WAS SPENDING QUALITY TIME
WITH HER EYEBROWS.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.565
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

27:50.636 --> 27:54.204
I-I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.
WHY, WHERE ARE WE GOING?

27:54.206 --> 27:56.774
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT<i> YOU'RE</i> DOING,
BUT I'M GOING HOME.

28:01.147 --> 28:05.149
COULDN'T RESIST,
COULD YOU?

28:05.151 --> 28:06.684
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

28:06.686 --> 28:08.585
AN E-MAILED CONFIRMATION

28:08.587 --> 28:10.587
OF MY APPLICATION
TO THAT TENNIS CLINIC.

28:10.589 --> 28:12.489
OKAY.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.491
WHICH WAS
SENT IN ELECTRONICALLY.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.527
YOU THINK<i> I</i> DID THAT?

28:16.529 --> 28:17.828
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I TOLD.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.663
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T.
SPENCER, GET REAL.

28:19.665 --> 28:21.732
OKAY, YOU AND I WANT
DIFFERENT THINGS,

28:21.734 --> 28:24.034
AND YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THAT, BUT YOU'RE NOT,
AND YOU NEVER WILL BE.

28:24.036 --> 28:27.504
I DID NOT SEND THAT IN,
BUT I APOLOGIZE IF
I MADE YOU FEEL LIKE--

28:27.506 --> 28:29.273
DON'T APOLOGIZE
FOR WHO YOU ARE
AND WHAT YOU WANT.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.476
I'M NOT GOING TO.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.341
AND SHE'S ALL, LIKE...

29:04.343 --> 29:06.910
AND SO NOW, HANNA'S
ON TOP OF THE BUNNY HILL,

29:06.912 --> 29:08.412
BUT I HAD TO, LIKE,
HYPNOTIZE HER

29:08.414 --> 29:10.414
TO GET HER TO GRAB ON
TO THE TOW ROPE.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.381
OKAY, I WAS FREEZING.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.649
YOU WERE FREAKED.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.618
NO, SEAN, MY EYELASHES
WERE CRACKING OFF.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.587
SHE SAYS TO ME...
"S-S-SEAN,

29:16.589 --> 29:20.290
C-CAN YOU C-CARRY ME
DOWN, P-PLEASE?"

29:20.292 --> 29:22.926
AND I'M LIKE, "BABE,
I'M RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.294
YOU'LL BE FINE."

29:24.296 --> 29:26.263
OH, HER TRUSTY
ST. BERNARD.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.098
YOU CAN SNOWPLOW
THE WHOLE WAY DOWN.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.100
"AND IF YOU FALL,
I'LL DRAG YOU BACK
TO THE BUS

29:30.102 --> 29:32.936
AND GET YOU DRUNK
SO I CAN LICK YOUR FACE."

29:32.938 --> 29:34.638
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

29:34.640 --> 29:36.540
I MEAN, SO WHAT IF
THEY'RE LOUSY GUARD DOGS?

29:36.542 --> 29:38.375
THEY'RE BIG
AND THEY'RE GOOFY,

29:38.377 --> 29:40.277
AND IF YOU CAN GET PAST
BUCKETS OF DROOL...

29:40.279 --> 29:43.213
I THINK HERMIE
THE HERMAPHRODITE
NEEDS A JUMBO COFFEE.

29:43.215 --> 29:45.983
I MEAN, WHO DOES NOT WANT
A BIG, SLOBBERING BEAST

29:45.985 --> 29:47.751
WHO CAN CATCH A BALL
IN THE END ZONE?

29:47.753 --> 29:49.019
THAT'S IT.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.854
( all shouting )
FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!

29:50.856 --> 29:52.289
Hanna: DON'T HIT HIM!

29:52.291 --> 29:53.857
SEAN! SEAN! STOP!

29:53.859 --> 29:55.993
IT'S LIKE FIGHTING A KID
THAT NEEDS A TELETHON.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.461
LUCAS,

29:57.463 --> 29:58.695
CAN I PLEASE
TALK TO YOU OUTSIDE?

30:02.668 --> 30:04.501
( gasps )
WHAT'S<i> HIS</i> DEAL?

30:17.082 --> 30:19.283
LUCAS, DID YOU COME HERE
TO WELCOME ME HOME

30:19.285 --> 30:20.851
OR TO PICK A FIGHT
WITH SEAN?

30:20.853 --> 30:22.853
HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
SOME PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED

30:22.855 --> 30:24.988
BETWEEN NEANDERTHAL
AND CRO-MAGNON.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.991
H-HE IS NOT THE ONE
THAT YOU'RE ANGRY AT.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.827
YOU CAME HERE
TO GET BACK AT ME.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.663
BREAKING NEWS, PRINCESS.
NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.198
WELL, THEN WHY
DID YOU CUT ME OFF?

30:34.200 --> 30:36.667
I WASN'T THE ONE WHO
DID THE CUTTING, REMEMBER?

30:36.669 --> 30:38.335
I<i> WANT</i> TO BE YOUR FRIEND,
LUCAS, BUT I JUST--

30:38.337 --> 30:40.337
NO! YOU PEOPLE JUST THINK
YOU CAN PUSH ME AROUND

30:40.339 --> 30:43.006
LIKE SOME KIND OF MOP!
AND YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT!

30:43.008 --> 30:45.175
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT
FROM THE REST OF
ALISON'S ANOINTED!

30:45.177 --> 30:47.144
WHAT?

30:47.146 --> 30:50.214
YOU LET HER MARCH
AROUND AND ACT LIKE SOME
17th-CENTURY TORTURE SQUAD,

30:50.216 --> 30:51.715
AND CONSIDERING WHAT
THAT BITCH DID TO ME,

30:51.717 --> 30:53.383
I SHOULD HAVE DONE
WAY WORSE TO HER!

30:55.421 --> 30:57.087
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:01.026 --> 31:02.893
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ALISON?

31:02.895 --> 31:06.029
DYING DOESN'T
MAKE YOU A SAINT.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.899
NOT WHEN YOU SPENT
ALL OF JUNIOR HIGH
BEING A<i> MONSTER.</i>

31:08.901 --> 31:13.036
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO WALK THROUGH THIS TOWN
EVERY SINGLE DAY

31:13.038 --> 31:14.605
AND LOOK AT
SOME SHRINE TO HER?

31:16.041 --> 31:18.208
THAT WAS<i> YOU</i> WHO DESTROYED
THE MEMORIAL?

31:24.149 --> 31:25.949
YOU CAN CALL THE COPS.

31:25.951 --> 31:27.951
TELL THEM TO MEET ME
IN MY DRIVEWAY.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.586
IT WILL TAKE ME
11 MINUTES TO WALK HOME.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.590
LUCAS, I'M NOT GONNA
CALL THE COPS.

31:36.195 --> 31:39.263
I THINK THAT WE CAN
KEEP THIS BETWEEN US.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.465
YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH ALREADY.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.699
DON'T. STOP.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.236
PLEASE.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.938
DON'T MAKE ME LIKE YOU.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.675
IT'S TOO HARD.

31:56.048 --> 31:59.049
( door opens, closes )

32:02.855 --> 32:04.388
IS HE GONE?

32:04.390 --> 32:05.689
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
ALONE WITH HIM.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.658
THAT KID IS CRACKED.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.993
YEAH, WELL,
ANYONE CAN SURPRISE YOU.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.128
WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

32:15.301 --> 32:18.635
YOU AND NOEL ARE
BEST BUDS, RIGHT?

32:18.637 --> 32:20.637
HOW WELL DO YOU
<i> REALLY</i> KNOW HIM?

32:20.639 --> 32:22.940
( mirthless chuckle )
OH, I GET IT.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.108
YOUR FRIEND'S
A CERTIFIED LOONY TUNE,

32:25.110 --> 32:26.944
SO NOW YOU WANT
TO PICK ON MINE?

32:26.946 --> 32:31.048
SEAN, EVERYONE'S GOT A LIFE
THAT NO ONE ELSE KNOWS ABOUT.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.587
I MEAN, WHO IS NOEL
WHEN HE'S NOT WITH YOU?

32:37.589 --> 32:40.590
HANNA, YOU'RE
FREAKING ME OUT.

32:40.592 --> 32:43.927
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
COME INSIDE AND TRY
TO HAVE SOME FUN.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.963
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE
ASKING ALL ABOUT--

32:45.965 --> 32:47.497
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST TELL THEM TO GO HOME.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.432
OKAY?

32:51.937 --> 32:53.737
I JUST WANT EVERYONE
TO GO HOME.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.476
YOU NEED TO CALL ALEX.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.144
AND TELL HIM WHAT?

33:01.146 --> 33:03.447
I CAN'T UNDO THIS
WITHOUT TELLING HIM
ABOUT "A."

33:05.250 --> 33:07.284
UNLESS YOU THINK
I SHOULD GO INTO THE KITCHEN

33:07.286 --> 33:10.120
AND ASK "A" TO PUT DOWN
THE PIECE OF PIZZA
AND CALL ALEX HIMSELF.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.788
STOP.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.324
WE DON'T KNOW THAT NOEL
IS THAT PERSON.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.930
AND BESIDES, I'M NOT EVEN
SURE WHAT "A" WANTS ANYMORE.

33:19.932 --> 33:21.031
ARE YOU?

33:22.468 --> 33:24.835
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU STICK FOUR LOBSTERS

33:24.837 --> 33:27.504
IN A TANK AND CUT OFF
THEIR FOOD SUPPLY?

33:27.506 --> 33:28.805
THEY START TO EAT EACH OTHER.

33:30.809 --> 33:31.875
CAN I GET TO THE BATHROOM?

33:33.712 --> 33:35.312
IS THERE A MAGIC PASSWORD?

33:40.953 --> 33:43.487
Okay, if we find out
that he<i> is</i>

33:43.489 --> 33:45.822
who we think he is,

33:45.824 --> 33:47.758
then what are we
prepared to do about it?

33:54.299 --> 33:56.767
( distant dog barking )

33:59.204 --> 34:01.371
YOU HUNGRY?

34:01.373 --> 34:02.339
NO.

34:13.852 --> 34:17.120
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
THAT EMILY TRIED
TO TALK TO ME.

34:17.122 --> 34:18.522
WHY WOULD I?

34:18.524 --> 34:20.090
WHAT CAN SHE SAY NOW
THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT BETTER?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.763
SHE WASN'T THE ONE
THAT TURNED ME IN.

34:26.765 --> 34:28.065
I KNOW THAT.

34:29.334 --> 34:30.634
HOW?

34:33.806 --> 34:34.938
BECAUSE I DID.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.742
( sighs )
LOOK, TOBY,

34:38.744 --> 34:40.911
IF YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND
LIKE YOU'RE SOME KIND
OF FUGITIVE,

34:40.913 --> 34:42.546
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PROVE
THAT YOU'RE INNOCENT?

34:48.353 --> 34:49.753
YOU NEED TO BE HOME...

34:52.691 --> 34:55.425
...WHERE YOU'RE SAFE.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.462
YOU COULD CHAIN ME
TO THIS PORCH,

34:58.464 --> 35:00.330
AND I'D STILL NEVER
TOUCH YOU LIKE THAT AGAIN.

35:04.369 --> 35:06.369
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

35:17.883 --> 35:19.549
( distant door closes )

35:21.386 --> 35:22.586
HELLO?

35:25.891 --> 35:27.257
IS SOMEONE THERE?

35:43.809 --> 35:45.475
HELLO?

35:48.947 --> 35:51.148
IS SOMEONE UPSTAIRS?

35:51.150 --> 35:52.782
( floorboards creak )

35:52.784 --> 35:54.784
( gasps )

35:58.690 --> 35:59.756
Damn it!

36:07.766 --> 36:09.132
( breathing heavily )
God!

36:10.602 --> 36:12.936
( rustling sound )

36:12.938 --> 36:14.404
( gasps )
Oh, God!

36:20.379 --> 36:21.912
( breathing heavily )

36:33.458 --> 36:36.927
( exhales )

36:36.929 --> 36:38.695
WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

36:38.697 --> 36:42.332
I-I THOUGHT THAT
SOMEONE... WAS IN HERE.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.234
YEAH.

36:44.236 --> 36:46.002
LOOKS LIKE A LOT
MORE THAN SOMEONE.
YOU HAD A<i> PARTY?</i>

36:46.004 --> 36:48.538
MONA INVITED PEOPLE OVER.
I HAD NO IDEA.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.618
( sighs )

37:10.862 --> 37:12.362
( door opens )

37:15.534 --> 37:17.901
HI.
HOW WAS THE PARTY?

37:17.903 --> 37:19.769
UH, JUST OKAY.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.705
HANNA WASN'T REALLY
IN THE PARTY MODE.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.373
WELL, CAN YOU BLAME HER?

37:23.375 --> 37:25.208
THAT GIRL DOESN'T NEED
ANY MORE SURPRISES

37:25.210 --> 37:26.576
FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE
OF YEARS, RIGHT?

37:28.947 --> 37:30.580
IS DAD SLEEPING?

37:30.582 --> 37:34.718
YOU KNOW WHAT?
AFTER YOU LEFT,
THE GOT A PHONE CALL.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.621
THE COMMANDER
WANTS HIM IN TEXAS
BY THE END OF THE MONTH.

37:37.623 --> 37:40.957
THIS MONTH?
WHY? HE JUST GOT HOME.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.960
I KNOW, EMILY.
IT'S NOT HIS DECISION.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.695
THERE'S JUST
A BIGGER PICTURE.

37:49.534 --> 37:50.667
Um...

37:52.037 --> 37:54.037
TONIGHT MEANT A LOT TO ME.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.307
THANK YOU.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.242
MAYA HAD A GREAT TIME.

37:59.244 --> 38:01.044
YOUR FATHER THINKS
SHE'S VERY SWEET.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.581
SHE IS.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.816
AND I'M GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT.

38:09.221 --> 38:10.487
I'M NOT OKAY WITH IT.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.760
THE WHOLE THING
MAKES ME SICK.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.161
SICK TO MY STOMACH.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.778
( sighs )
HEY, DAD.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.279
HEY, SPENCE.

38:36.281 --> 38:38.448
DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.451
I WOULD HAVE WATCHED
THE GAME DOWNSTAIRS
WITH YOU.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.286
YOUR MOTHER MAKES ME
WATCH IT ON MUTE.

38:43.288 --> 38:44.521
JUST GOT HOME.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.960
HE'S GOT A LOT OF STUFF, IAN.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.129
( chuckles softly )
YEAH.

38:53.131 --> 38:57.634
SUDDENLY HE'S, UH,
EVERYWHERE, ISN'T HE?

38:57.636 --> 38:59.636
WELL, MAYBE IT'LL
INSPIRE YOUR SISTER

38:59.638 --> 39:02.105
TO FINISH THAT CONDO
SO THEY CAN MOVE IN.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.773
( wearily )
DAD...

39:03.775 --> 39:05.775
THEY MIGHT<i> NEVER</i>
MOVE OUT OF HERE.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.544
MELISSA<i> LOVES</i> THE BARN.

39:07.546 --> 39:08.978
YEAH, WELL, MELISSA'S
ALWAYS NEEDED

39:08.980 --> 39:11.481
A LITTLE NUDGE
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.983
THAT'S WHY YOUR MOTHER THINKS
IAN IS SO GOOD FOR HER.

39:13.985 --> 39:17.187
HE'S "IMPULSIVE"
AND, UH, "PASSIONATE."

39:17.189 --> 39:19.022
YOU DON'T AGREE?

39:19.024 --> 39:22.359
I HAVE A FEW OTHER
CHOICE WORDS I WOULD
RESERVE FOR IAN,

39:22.361 --> 39:25.228
BUT IF I START LISTING THEM,
I'LL NEVER FALL ASLEEP.

39:28.300 --> 39:29.632
OH, UM...

39:31.470 --> 39:34.003
I SPOKE TO A FRIEND OF MINE
ON THE POLICE FORCE TONIGHT.

39:34.005 --> 39:37.507
THE BLOODSTAIN THEY
FOUND ON THAT SWEATER
AT TOBY CAVANAUGH'S

39:37.509 --> 39:40.176
WAS A POSITIVE MATCH.

39:40.178 --> 39:43.246
I DON'T THINK THAT KID'S
GONNA BE AROUND MUCH LONGER
TO SCARE YOU.

39:43.248 --> 39:44.647
IT'S ALISON'S BLOOD?

39:48.987 --> 39:52.689
UM... DOES THAT MEAN
IT'S DONE?

39:52.691 --> 39:54.891
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO INVESTIGATE ANYONE ELSE?

39:54.893 --> 39:56.693
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE RELIEVED.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.164
DON'T STAY UP
TOO LATE, OKAY?

40:23.722 --> 40:26.222
MY GOD, I MISSED
YOU GUYS SO MUCH!

40:26.224 --> 40:28.158
WHY ARE YOU SO TAN?

40:28.160 --> 40:30.160
HOW DID YOU GET SO SUN-KISSED
SITTING IN YOUR GRANDMA'S
APARTMENT?

40:30.162 --> 40:32.595
I THOUGHT SHE WAS, LIKE,
BEDRIDDEN, IN A CAVE.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.063
DOESN'T MEAN<i> I</i> WAS.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.732
SO, ARE WE STILL ON
FOR TONIGHT, LADIES?

40:35.734 --> 40:38.234
TOTALLY. SPENCER'S MOM
SAID THAT WE COULD
USE THEIR BARN.

40:38.236 --> 40:41.070
YEAH, BUT THERE MIGHT BE
A MAJOR STORM TONIGHT,
SO I DON'T KNOW IF--

40:41.072 --> 40:42.505
IT'S THE LAST BLOWOUT
BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS, HAN.

40:42.507 --> 40:43.773
DON'T BRING ME DOWN.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.575
HEY, CAN ONE OF YOU GUYS
GET THOSE?

40:45.577 --> 40:47.410
MY ARMS ARE REALLY SORE.

40:47.412 --> 40:49.078
YEAH.
WHY?

40:49.080 --> 40:51.648
DID YOU HAVE TO,
LIKE, LIFT YOUR GRANDMA
AND BATHE HER?

40:51.650 --> 40:53.116
YEAH. IT WAS
REALLY DISGUSTING.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.284
DID YOU GO TO HILTON HEAD?

40:56.855 --> 40:58.922
OH, YEAH. NANA
HAD A DAY OUT,

40:58.924 --> 41:00.457
AND SHE'S REALLY INTO GOLF.

41:00.459 --> 41:01.791
DON'T ASK.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.793
SO, WHO'S IN CHARGE
OF REFRESHMENTS?

41:03.795 --> 41:05.862
HANNA STOLE A BOTTLE
OF TEQUILA.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.097
GENIUS. GOOD JOB, HAN.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.099
HOLD ONTO THOSE
BAGGY SWEATERS.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.135
ISN'T HILTON HEAD
IN SOUTH CAROLINA?

41:12.137 --> 41:14.437
I THOUGHT YOUR GRANDMA
LIVED IN GEORGIA.

41:14.439 --> 41:15.939
IT'S STILL THE SOUTH,
SPENCE.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.707
WHY SO MANY QUESTIONS?

41:17.709 --> 41:19.375
GUYS, WE'VE GOT A LONG
NIGHT AHEAD OF US.

41:19.377 --> 41:22.612
I CAN'T SPILL EVERY DETAIL
THE MINUTE I HIT THE CURB.

41:22.614 --> 41:25.281
WAIT FOR IT.
WAIT FOR IT.
WAIT FOR IT.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.419
SPENCE, DON'T FORGET

41:29.421 --> 41:31.321
TO TURN OFF
THE YARD LIGHTS, OKAY?

41:33.225 --> 41:37.293

41:40.365 --> 41:42.966
<i> ¶ WHAT I'M GONNA DO ¶</i>

HE SAW SOMEBODY--
DON'T...

41:48.473 --> 41:50.206
TALK ANYMORE.

41:52.611 --> 41:53.710

42:19.905 --> 42:23.640
I'LL GET YOUR BED READY.

42:23.642 --> 42:26.709
TAKE YOUR MEDICINE, HANNA.
TOMORROW'S ANOTHER DAY.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.711
