WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:03.920
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED IN FRONT OF

00:04.003 --> 00:05.922
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.005 --> 00:07.757
- WHY ARE YOU WATCHING
THE LAST EPISODE OF

00:07.841 --> 00:09.259
<i>EDGE OF TOMORROW?</i>

00:09.342 --> 00:10.760
- AH-HA!

00:10.844 --> 00:13.304
YOU SAID YOU NEVER WATCHED IT.
YOU SAID IT WAS TERRIBLE.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.598
- NO, I WATCHED IT.

00:15.682 --> 00:19.769
I SAID <i> YOU</i> WERE TERRIBLE.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.564
- IT'S THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY
OF THE CANCELLATION OF THE SHOW.

00:22.647 --> 00:25.400
SO WE WATCH IT WITH VICTORIA
TO CHEER HER UP.

00:25.483 --> 00:27.569
- IT'S THE ONE DAY OF THE YEAR
I RESERVE TO REALLY

00:27.652 --> 00:30.655
THINK ABOUT MYSELF.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.867
NOW WATCH.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.957
- LADY NATALIE.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.753
DR. TESS MONTGOMERY.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.797
JUDGE THORNDIKE.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.758
I ALWAYS EXPECTED ONE OF YOU
TO BETRAY ME.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.260
BUT NOT ALL THREE.

00:52.343 --> 00:53.970
- YOU'RE RUINED,
HONOR ST. RAVEN.

00:54.053 --> 00:57.140
PACK YOUR BAGS AND LEAVE...

00:57.223 --> 00:58.975
PRIMROSE VALLEY.

00:59.058 --> 01:01.269
- LIKE MANY
OF THE HARLOTS BEFORE YOU,

01:01.352 --> 01:03.772
YOU WILL NOT BE MISSED,
MY DEAR.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.815
- WHY ALL THIS CRUELTY?

01:05.899 --> 01:09.819
- AS YOU WELL KNOW,
OUR RELATIONSHIP NEVER RECOVERED

01:09.903 --> 01:12.572
FROM YOUR LITTLE AFFAIR
WITH LUIS...

01:12.655 --> 01:15.825
THE SEXY LATIN POOL BOY.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.952
- I HAVEN'T BEEN
A SEXY LATIN POOL BOY

01:18.036 --> 01:21.164
FOR 15 YEARS.

01:21.247 --> 01:24.167
I AM A SEXY LATIN LAWYER.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.837
- THAT'S IT!
I'M LEAVING.

01:27.921 --> 01:31.883
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST
OF HONOR ST. RAVEN!

01:33.885 --> 01:36.429
OH, MY GOD.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.725
HOW TRAGIC IS IT
THAT I WILL NEVER KNOW

01:40.809 --> 01:42.227
WHAT WAS WAITING
FOR HONOR ST. RAVEN

01:42.310 --> 01:43.645
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT DOOR?

01:43.728 --> 01:46.481
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S TRAGIC.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.025
THEY'VE STOPPED MAKING
MY FAVORITE LIPSTICK COLOR.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.194
- OH, MAN!
- UNBELIEVABLE THEY DID THAT.

01:51.277 --> 01:55.907
I'VE BEEN WEARING
"PROHIBITION PINK" FOR 75 YEARS.

01:57.408 --> 01:58.910
- I KNOW WHAT'LL
CHEER YOU UP.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.787
LET'S WATCH
THE LAST EPISODE AGAIN.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.540
ONLY THIS TIME WITH
MY VOICE-OVER COMMENTARY.

02:03.623 --> 02:07.377
- IS THAT ON THE DVD?
- NO, I'LL JUST DO IT NOW.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.672
- WAIT, I'M GETTING
A VISION OF THE FUTURE.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.257
OH, IT'S ME...

02:12.340 --> 02:16.553
PUNCTURING MY OWN EARDRUMS.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.929
- YOU KNOW THOUGH, IT'S TOO BAD
THEY DIDN'T BRING IT

02:18.012 --> 02:20.056
BACK ONLINE AS WEBISODES.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.432
LIKE THEY TRIED TO DO
WITH <i> ALL MY CHILDREN.</i>

02:21.516 --> 02:23.560
- I'LL DO IT.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.770
I'LL STAR IN NEW WEBISODES
OF <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW.</i>

02:25.854 --> 02:27.230
- VICTORIA, YOU'RE DOING
THAT THING WHERE YOU ACCEPT

02:27.313 --> 02:30.525
PARTS IN SHOWS
THAT DON'T EXIST.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.402
- NO, BUT IT CAN.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.070
I MEAN, FANS HAVE
OBSESSED FOR YEARS

02:34.153 --> 02:35.905
ABOUT WHAT WAS BEHIND
THAT DOOR.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.033
NOW ALL I NEED TO DO
IS TO GET APRYL SINCLAIRE,

02:39.117 --> 02:40.743
THE SHOW'S CREATOR,
ON BOARD.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.245
- SHE'LL NEVER DO IT.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.746
OH, THEY COULDN'T
STAND EACH OTHER.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.874
- THEY FOUGHT ALL THE TIME
ABOUT WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE

02:45.957 --> 02:47.083
FOR HONOR ST. RAVEN.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.751
- WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.420
I MEAN, SURE SHE
CREATED THE CHARACTER

02:50.503 --> 02:52.589
AND WROTE HER LINES,
BUT IT WAS MY ACTING

02:52.672 --> 02:55.758
THAT BROUGHT HER TO LIFE.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.260
NOW APRYL WAS
A HORRID PIG ABOUT IT

02:57.343 --> 03:00.430
BUT I ALWAYS
TOOK THE HIGH ROAD.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.307
- BUT WEREN'T YOUR
LAST WORDS TO APRYL,

03:02.390 --> 03:03.808
"I HATE YOU
AND I HOPE YOU DIE."

03:03.892 --> 03:08.605
- WELL, IN HOLLYWOOD
THAT'S PRACTICALLY "ALOHA."

03:08.688 --> 03:11.441
IT MEANS BOTH
"HELLO" AND "GOOD-BYE."

03:25.330 --> 03:26.581
{\an8}- VICTORIA CHASE.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.416
{\an8}- HUGH FLETCHER?
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?

03:28.499 --> 03:30.126
{\an8}- I SHOULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

03:30.209 --> 03:34.631
{\an8}AND I WILL.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

03:34.714 --> 03:37.258
{\an8}- THE DAY AFTER OUR SHOW ENDED,
I TOOK ALL OF MY MONEY

03:37.342 --> 03:40.845
{\an8}AND I MADE A LITTLE FILM
CALLED <i> TWILIGHT.</i>

03:40.929 --> 03:42.430
{\an8}- THAT'S AMAZING!

03:42.513 --> 03:45.475
{\an8}- AND THEN THE REAL <i> TWILIGHT</i>
CAME OUT.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.185
{\an8}AND I WAS SUED
FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

03:47.268 --> 03:48.770
{\an8}AND I LOST EVERYTHING.

03:48.853 --> 03:52.398
{\an8}SO NOW I'M WORKING
AS APRYL SINCLAIRE'S BUTLER.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.611
{\an8}- [gasps]

03:56.694 --> 03:59.697
{\an8}WELL, THIS ROOM IS EXACTLY
LIKE OUR OLD SET.

03:59.781 --> 04:03.534
{\an8}OH, IF I PULL OPEN A DRAWER,
WILL DR. TESS MONTGOMERY'S

04:03.618 --> 04:05.954
{\an8}DIALOG BE WRITTEN IN IT?

04:06.037 --> 04:08.331
{\an8}- AND YET, THAT BUBBLEHEAD
GOT ALL THE MEATY SCENES

04:08.414 --> 04:10.667
{\an8}AND I WAS RELEGATED
TO PROVIDING EXPOSITION

04:10.750 --> 04:14.796
{\an8}AND REMINDING OTHERS
OF WHAT THE PLOT POINTS WERE!

04:14.879 --> 04:16.547
{\an8}- WELL, TO BE HONEST,
I NEVER REALLY PAID ATTENTION

04:16.630 --> 04:19.968
{\an8}TO WHAT THE OTHER PEOPLE
ON THE SHOW WERE SAYING.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.552
{\an8}- WELL, WELL, WELL.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.013
{\an8}LOOK WHAT
THE CAT DRUG IN.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.016
{\an8}- APRYL SINCLAIRE,
MY <i> OLD</i> FRIEND.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.687
- THIS IS AN AWKWARD MOMENT.

04:30.770 --> 04:34.023
THE TWO OF YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN EACH OTHER IN THREE YEARS.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.318
AND YOU DID NOT DEPART
ON THE BEST OF TERMS.

04:44.158 --> 04:48.204
I SHOULD EXIT.
[clears throat]

04:48.287 --> 04:51.165
I FEAR WE STARTED OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.917
I ACTUALLY CAME HERE
TO BURY THE HATCHET

04:53.001 --> 04:54.502
AND MOVE FORWARD.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.129
- NOT UNTIL YOU SAY
THAT HONOR ST. RAVEN

04:56.212 --> 04:57.422
WAS BASED ON ME.

04:57.505 --> 04:58.881
- I'LL GLADLY
SAY THOSE WORDS.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.260
HONOR ST. RAVEN
WAS BASED ON ME.

05:02.343 --> 05:03.219
- I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE THIS FIGHT.

05:03.302 --> 05:04.721
- NEITHER DO I.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.347
- I'M HONOR ST. RAVEN.
- HONOR ST. RAVEN IS ME.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.348
- I'M HER.
- FINE.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.517
SHE'S ME.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.894
AND NOW THAT THAT'S SETTLED,
UH, LET'S TALK ABOUT

05:11.978 --> 05:13.104
WHY I'M HERE.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.731
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HELP ME BRING BACK

05:14.814 --> 05:15.732
<i>EDGE OF TOMORROW?</i>

05:15.815 --> 05:17.567
- YOU MEAN ON TV?
- NOT EXACTLY.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.193
- WEBISODES?
LIKE <i> ALL MY CHILDREN?</i>

05:19.277 --> 05:20.611
- NOT EXACTLY.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.696
I'VE TALKED
TO SOME MARKETING PEOPLE

05:21.779 --> 05:25.408
WHO WANT TO
DO IT AS AN APP.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.035
- AN APP?

05:27.118 --> 05:28.453
- THE NEWS STATION
WHERE I WORK

05:28.536 --> 05:30.455
HAS AGREED
TO RECREATE THE SET,

05:30.538 --> 05:32.415
AND WITH PRODUCT PLACEMENT,
WE CAN PAY FOR THE WHOLE THING.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.583
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

05:33.666 --> 05:36.753
- [gasps] HUGH!

05:36.836 --> 05:38.755
- I HAVE STANDING ORDERS
TO HAVE THE BAGS READY

05:38.838 --> 05:40.590
SHOULD ANYBODY SHOW
THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF INTEREST

05:40.673 --> 05:42.592
IN RESURRECTING THE SHOW.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.010
TO SUM UP...

05:44.093 --> 05:47.096
SHE'LL DO IT.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.435
AFTER OUR LONG FLIGHT
FROM LOS ANGELES,

05:52.518 --> 05:56.564
WE HAVE ARRIVED
IN CLEVELAND.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.316
- WELL, VICTORIA,
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.275
YOU'RE BRINGING
YOUR SHOW BACK.

05:59.358 --> 06:00.276
- MY SHOW.

06:00.359 --> 06:03.446
- APRYL IS CORRECT,
MY SHOW.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.615
AND WE HAVE
OUR FIRST SPONSOR.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.493
THE GOOD PEOPLE
AT 3 MUSKETEERS.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.411
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT A MAJOR CHARACTER

06:10.495 --> 06:12.455
IS SEEN EATING
A 3 MUSKETEERS BAR

06:12.538 --> 06:15.083
OR IS NAMED
"3 MUSKETEERS BAR."

06:15.166 --> 06:16.584
- I'M SORRY BUT IT ALWAYS
TAKES ME OUT OF A SHOW

06:16.667 --> 06:20.463
WHEN I SEE A PRODUCT
DISPLAYED SO BOLDLY.

06:20.546 --> 06:24.133
BUT WOW, THESE THINGS
ARE REALLY GOOD!

06:24.217 --> 06:26.969
- JOY, YOU'LL BE HAPPY
TO KNOW THAT HECTOR CRUZ--

06:27.053 --> 06:29.764
- THE SEXY LATIN LAWYER.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.307
- HAS AGREED TO DO THE SHOW
JUST BECAUSE OF YOU.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.975
- OH, PLEASE.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.269
I DID HIS EYEBROWS
ON THE SHOW A FEW TIMES.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.480
HE FLIRTED WITH ME,
BUT BESIDES HIS BEING MARRIED,

06:37.563 --> 06:38.481
HE'S JUST NOT MY TYPE.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.941
- BUT HE'S NOT MARRIED ANYMORE.

06:40.024 --> 06:42.276
- HOT DAMN,
I AM SO GONNA TAP THAT.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.074
- ME TOO.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.158
- WHAT?

06:49.242 --> 06:52.328
- IT'S JUST AS LIKELY.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.122
- OKAY, EVERYBODY, LET'S GO.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.499
YOU'RE A WRITER,
SO YOU'LL BE MY WRITING STAFF.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.668
- AS SOON AS YOU
LET GO OF MY FACE, OKAY.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.462
- AND YOU CAN
DO HAIR AND MAKEUP!

07:01.546 --> 07:05.174
- I KNOW I CAN.
IT'S MY JOB.

07:05.258 --> 07:09.679
- GRAB MY FACE,
YOU'LL PULL BACK A STUMP.

07:12.431 --> 07:15.476
- OKAY, IF I'M THE WRITER,
I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.853
HOW MANY ACTORS
ARE COMING BACK?

07:16.936 --> 07:18.563
- ONLY THE ONES
FROM THE LAST SCENE.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.022
IT'S ALL WE COULD AFFORD.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.899
- WELL, THEN WHO'S
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR?

07:21.983 --> 07:25.069
- OOH, WE DIDN'T
THINK ABOUT THAT.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.988
- WELL, AS WE ALL KNOW,
EVERYONE ON THE SHOW

07:27.071 --> 07:28.281
HAD AN EVIL TWIN.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.616
- MY CHARACTER
HAD TWO EVIL TWINS.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.869
- AS I DO
IN REAL LIFE.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.495
- OKAY.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.705
IF WE'RE GONNA
CONTINUE THE SERIES,

07:35.788 --> 07:36.581
HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THAT

07:36.664 --> 07:38.166
ALL THE OTHER
CHARACTERS DISAPPEARED?

07:38.249 --> 07:39.834
WE CAN'T JUST SAY
AN ATOM BOMB WENT OFF.

07:39.917 --> 07:44.046
- WAIT, I'VE GOT IT.
AN ATOM BOMB WENT OFF.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.715
[cell phone beeps]

07:45.798 --> 07:47.884
- OH, NO.
IT'S FROM ELIZABETH MEADOW.

07:47.967 --> 07:53.181
- THE UPPER CRUST
BRITISH LADY NATALIE.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.724
- SHE GOT A BETTER OFFER.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.100
SHE'S PLAYING
A CORPSE ON <i> PSYCH.</i>

07:56.184 --> 08:00.229
- CABLE'S DELIGHTFUL
MYSTERY COMEDY.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.898
- OKAY, NOW WHAT
ARE WE GONNA DO?

08:01.981 --> 08:03.191
WE HAVE TO FIND AN ACTRESS
TO PLAY THIS PART

08:03.274 --> 08:04.901
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

08:04.984 --> 08:09.155
- PERHAPS, MY DEAR,
I CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.746
- WELL AS YOU ALL CAN SEE,
VICTORIA'S NEWS STATION

08:16.829 --> 08:19.874
DID AN EXCELLENT JOB
IN RECREATING OUR SET.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.709
- WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.128
UH, SOME OF THE WINDOWS
AND DOORS DON'T WORK.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.463
BUT IT'LL DO.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.924
AND WE HAVE
TWO NEW SPONSORS.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.426
BED, BATH &amp; BEYOND
AND THEN AT SOME POINT

08:30.509 --> 08:32.929
SOMEONE HAS TO SAY
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NANA,

08:33.011 --> 08:36.724
FROM ED AND DENISE MILCH.

08:36.807 --> 08:37.975
- YEAH, THAT'LL
BE EASY TO FIT IN.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.268
- [laughs]

08:39.352 --> 08:42.438
- VICTORIA!

08:42.520 --> 08:44.774
I AM SO EXCITED!

08:44.857 --> 08:47.068
OH, YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.110
- I'M NOT VICTORIA.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.113
- JESSICA, I'M VICTORIA.
- OH!

08:51.197 --> 08:52.782
VICTORIA!

08:52.865 --> 08:56.118
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.
- OH-HO-HO.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.120
- AND APRYL...

08:58.204 --> 09:02.124
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.793
- JESSICA, HI,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.128
- OH, I GOT LASIK SURGERY.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.672
ON MY EYES.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.132
I DON'T THINK
IT TURNED OUT SO GOOD.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.177
EVEN THOUGH I WENT
TO A REALLY GOOD EYE DENTIST.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.096
SO YOU MAY HAVE TO WRITE
MY LINES A LITTLE BIGGER

09:15.179 --> 09:17.473
INSIDE THE DRAWERS.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.267
- JOY!

09:19.350 --> 09:20.643
WHERE ARE YOU, MY SWEET?

09:20.726 --> 09:24.772
- IT'S HECTOR.
HE'S HERE.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.316
- JOY.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.443
- YOU'RE AS BEAUTIFUL
AS EVER.

09:29.527 --> 09:33.322
- I RECOGNIZE YOU AS WELL.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.242
- YES, I AM NO LONGER
A SLAVE TO THE GYM.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.160
I GOT RID OF MY TRAINER.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.121
- WHAT'D HE DO, EAT HIM?

09:42.873 --> 09:45.376
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR HAIR?
- IT WAS A WEAVE.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.296
I GOT BEHIND
ON MY PAYMENTS.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.507
WHAT HASN'T THINNED...

09:51.591 --> 09:53.009
IS MY DESIRE FOR YOU.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.802
[loud kiss]

09:54.885 --> 09:58.514
<i>AY DIOS MIO,</i> I COULD
TAKE YOU RIGHT NOW!

09:58.597 --> 10:01.517
- OUT FOR A BURGER.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.477
- OKAY, EVERYONE,
GET IN COSTUME.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.230
REHEARSAL IN TEN.
- I'LL BE BACK IN FIVE.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.775
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE OFF MY SHIRT.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.653
AM I RIGHT, LADIES?

10:12.737 --> 10:17.658
- OH, HECTOR,
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.870
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.371
WE'RE STILL GONNA
GO THROUGH WITH THIS,

10:22.455 --> 10:26.167
DESPITE SEVERAL
OBVIOUS POTENTIAL DISASTERS.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.881
- ALL RIGHT.
FROM HONOR'S LINE AND ACTION.

10:31.964 --> 10:36.218
- LADY NATALIE.

10:36.302 --> 10:40.181
DR. TESS MONTGOMERY.

10:40.264 --> 10:43.726
JUDGE THORNDIKE.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.394
I ALWAYS EXPECTED ONE OF YOU
TO BETRAY ME.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.063
BUT NOT ALL THREE.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.898
- CUT.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.859
VICTORIA, HONOR ST. RAVEN
CRIES AFTER THAT LINE.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.362
- HONOR ST. RAVEN
WOULD DO NO SUCH THING

10:54.445 --> 10:57.573
BECAUSE HONOR ST. RAVEN, ME,
WOULD NEVER GIVE THESE PEOPLE

10:57.656 --> 10:59.950
THE SATISFACTION
OF CRYING IN FRONT OF THEM.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.243
- OKAY, WHAT IF HONOR
SAYS "I WON'T GIVE YOU

11:01.327 --> 11:04.038
"THE SATISFACTION
OF SEEING ME CRY.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.748
"INSTEAD I WILL
TAKE SATISFACTION

11:05.831 --> 11:07.917
"FROM THIS CLASSIC LIGHT
AND FLUFFY WHIPPED NOUGAT

11:08.000 --> 11:10.795
3 MUSKETEERS BAR."

11:10.878 --> 11:12.546
- POWERFUL.
- GOOD STUFF.

11:12.630 --> 11:16.217
- YEAH, IT JUST CAME TO ME.
IN A TEXT FROM OUR SPONSOR.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.512
- OKAY, PLACES EVERYONE.
LET'S START WITH JESSICA'S LINE.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.600
- YOU'RE RUINED,
HONOR ST. RAVEN.

11:24.683 --> 11:30.231
PACK YOUR BAGS
AND LEAVE...

11:30.314 --> 11:32.817
PRIMROSE VALLEY.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.611
- LIKE THE MANY
HARLOTS BEFORE YOU,

11:35.694 --> 11:39.657
YOU WILL NOT BE MISSED,
MY DEAR.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.450
- CUT.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.785
WHAT'S WITH THE STRAW?

11:42.868 --> 11:45.287
- I'M CONSERVING
MY LIPSTICK.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.958
SO F.Y.I.,
NO KISSING SCENES.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.795
SORRY, HUGH.

11:52.878 --> 11:56.465
- OKAY, FROM HONOR'S LINE
AND ACTION.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.592
- WHY ALL THIS CRUELTY?

11:58.676 --> 12:01.262
- AS YOU WELL KNOW...

12:01.345 --> 12:03.472
OUR RELATIONSHIP
HAS NEVER RECOVERED

12:03.556 --> 12:05.182
FROM YOUR LITTLE...

12:05.266 --> 12:07.518
AFFAIR WITH LUIS...

12:07.601 --> 12:10.354
THE SEXY LATIN POOL BOY.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.149
- I HAVEN'T BEEN
A SEXY LATIN POOL BOY

12:13.232 --> 12:15.609
IN 15 YEARS.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.237
I'M A SEXY LATIN LAWYER.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.824
[sighs]
WHAT DO WE DO?

12:21.907 --> 12:23.826
- WELL, WE COULD DO
WHAT YOU DID WITH ACTRESSES

12:23.909 --> 12:26.120
THAT GOT PREGNANT
ON YOUR SHOW.

12:26.203 --> 12:29.790
- I HAVEN'T BEEN
A SEXY LATIN POOL BOY

12:29.874 --> 12:32.460
IN 15 YEARS.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.629
I'M A SEXY LATIN LAWYER,
WHO LIKES HIS WOMEN

12:35.713 --> 12:38.966
LIKE HE LIKES HIS LAUNDRY--
FRESH, FOLDED.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.472
- I'LL WORK ON THAT LINE.
- MM.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.348
LET'S GO TO VICTORIA
AT THE DOOR.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.977
- WELL, THAT'S IT.
I'M LEAVING.

12:50.060 --> 12:54.482
AND YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST
OF HONOR ST. RAVEN!

12:54.565 --> 12:55.858
OH, MY GOD.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.360
- [gasps] IT'S...

12:58.444 --> 12:59.361
[drawer opens]

12:59.445 --> 13:02.531
MADE IN CHINA!

13:02.615 --> 13:04.366
- OTHER DRAWER, HONEY!

13:04.450 --> 13:05.326
- IT'S...

13:05.409 --> 13:07.703
[drawer opens]

13:07.786 --> 13:10.164
SENATOR JASON VON KLAUSS!

13:10.247 --> 13:13.334
- MY TWIN BROTHER,
WHOM I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO

13:13.417 --> 13:15.878
IN 20 YEARS.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.839
AND I REFUSE TO BE
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM!

13:21.467 --> 13:25.554
UNH! GEEZ!

13:25.638 --> 13:29.183
- UH, THAT'S ONE OF THE DOORS
THAT DOESN'T WORK.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.227
- IT'S...

13:31.310 --> 13:35.481
SENATOR JASON VON KLAUSS!

13:35.564 --> 13:39.735
- I HAVE SHOCKING NEWS.

13:39.818 --> 13:43.614
TERRORISTS HAVE
SET OFF AN ATOMIC BOMB.

13:43.697 --> 13:47.159
EVERYONE ELSE
IN PRIMROSE VALLEY HAVE GONE...

13:47.243 --> 13:50.704
TO THE GREAT BEYOND.

13:50.788 --> 13:54.583
AND ALL WE HAVE LEFT
ARE THESE FEW ITEMS

13:54.667 --> 13:56.418
FROM THE GREAT...

13:56.502 --> 13:59.255
BED, BATH &amp; BEYOND.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.598
- ONLY ONE THING
WOULD SURPRISE ME MORE.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.101
IF YOU WERE TO SAY...

14:12.184 --> 14:16.522
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NANA,
FROM ED AND DENISE MILCH."

14:21.151 --> 14:24.446
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
EVERYONE IS GONE.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.948
- CUT.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.325
ONCE AGAIN, THE STAGE
DIRECTIONS SAY "CRY."

14:28.409 --> 14:31.120
- AND ONCE AGAIN,
HONOR ST. RAVEN WOULD NOT CRY.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.831
WHICH I KNOW BECAUSE
I AM HONOR ST. RAVEN.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.791
- NO, I AM HONOR ST. RAVEN!

14:35.874 --> 14:38.294
YOU'RE JUST A PUPPET
THAT BUTCHERS MY LINES.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.920
I'M GONNA PULL THE PLUG
ON THIS DISASTER.

14:40.004 --> 14:40.963
- YEAH!

14:41.046 --> 14:42.464
YEAH, GO AHEAD
AND GIVE UP.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.174
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO BEST.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.635
GOD, IF YOU HAD ANY GUTS
AT ALL, THEN OUR SHOW

14:46.719 --> 14:48.012
WOULD STILL
BE ON THE AIR!

14:48.095 --> 14:49.972
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.765
I HATE YOU
AND I HOPE YOU DIE!

14:51.849 --> 14:53.809
- OH, VERY MATURE.

14:53.892 --> 14:57.479
I HATE YOU
AND I HOPE <i> YOU</i> DIE.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.482
- NO, GUYS, DON'T GO NOW!
THE NEXT SCENE IS GOLD!

15:00.566 --> 15:01.609
AND WE HAVE TO PAY
FOR LUNCH

15:01.692 --> 15:04.028
IF WE DON'T MENTION
THE TACO TRUCK.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.994
- WELL, I'M LEAVING.
THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.330
- THANKS FOR RUINING MY CAREER.
- I GAVE YOU YOUR CAREER.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.498
- AND THEN YOU
TOOK IT AWAY.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.042
IF YOU HAD STOOD UP
TO THE NETWORK,

15:18.125 --> 15:19.501
<i>EDGE OF TOMORROW</i>
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN CANCELLED.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.337
BUT YOU JUST GAVE UP
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.796
AND I AM NOT LETTING YOU
GO BACK TO L.A.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.173
UNTIL YOU ADMIT
THAT I'M RIGHT.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.967
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- WOW.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.177
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PUT UP MUCH OF A FIGHT,

15:28.260 --> 15:29.720
DO YOU?

15:29.803 --> 15:32.014
- YES, I COULD HAVE
KEPT THE SHOW ON THE AIR.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.975
BUT ONLY IF I KILLED OFF
HONOR ST. RAVEN.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.226
THAT'S WHAT WAS
WAITING FOR YOU

15:36.310 --> 15:37.853
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT DOOR--A BULLET.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.355
- WELL, SO WHAT?

15:39.438 --> 15:40.648
I'VE BEEN KILLED OFF
FIVE OR SIX TIMES.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.025
I ALWAYS COME BACK.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.402
ONCE I EVEN HAD TO PERFORM
BRAIN SURGERY ON MYSELF

15:45.486 --> 15:49.323
WHILE BEING HELD HOSTAGE
IN A SUBMARINE.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.866
- NO, THIS WOULD
HAVE BEEN A REAL DEATH.

15:50.949 --> 15:53.202
YOU SEE, THE NETWORK WANTED
THE SHOW TO REVOLVE AROUND...

15:53.285 --> 15:54.745
A YOUNGER CHARACTER.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.330
- YOUNGER?

15:56.413 --> 16:00.000
- YES.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.211
- OH.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.380
- WOW.
- I KNOW.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.590
BUT SHOULD WE REALLY
BE EAVESDROPPING?

16:06.674 --> 16:10.344
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
LET'S GO.

16:10.427 --> 16:11.720
- I EVEN WROTE
HER DEATH SCENE

16:11.804 --> 16:12.888
BUT I COULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

16:12.971 --> 16:15.599
I LOVED HONOR ST. RAVEN
TOO MUCH.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.519
- SO YOU CANCELLED THE SHOW
TO KEEP HER ALIVE.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.730
- YES.
- I SEE.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.440
UH, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
TELLING ME,

16:23.524 --> 16:25.734
WHAT WERE MY DYING WORDS?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.903
- WELL, I DON'T
REMEMBER THEM EXACTLY.

16:27.986 --> 16:28.946
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

16:29.029 --> 16:32.032
I WOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THEM EXACTLY.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.910
- YOU APOLOGIZED TO ANYONE
YOU MAY HAVE WRONGED.

16:34.993 --> 16:38.497
AND THEN YOU WHISPERED,
"HONOR ST. RAVEN IS NO MORE."

16:40.541 --> 16:45.963
- "HONOR ST. RAVEN,
NEVER MORE."

16:46.046 --> 16:50.050
- AND I HAVEN'T
WRITTEN A WORD SINCE.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.386
- WE REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE SPYING ON THEM LIKE THIS.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.097
- I KNOW.
WE SHOULD GO.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.765
- SERIOUSLY. NOW.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.809
- UH-HUH.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.186
- THANK YOU.
- FOR WHAT?

17:01.270 --> 17:03.272
- FOR CREATING HONOR,
PROTECTING HER,

17:03.355 --> 17:05.441
AND LOVING HER
AS MUCH AS I DID.

17:05.523 --> 17:08.152
BECAUSE SHE WAS YOU.

17:08.234 --> 17:10.194
- SHE WAS BOTH OF US.
- MAYBE A LITTLE MORE ME.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.489
- BUT PROBABLY NOT.

17:12.573 --> 17:16.660
- FEELS LIKE
SHE'S REALLY DEAD NOW.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.788
MAYBE I CAN FINALLY SAY
GOOD-BYE AND MOURN HER LOSS.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.998
- ME TOO.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.625
- AND MAYBE WE CAN
FINALLY BOTH MOVE ON.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.461
- I DON'T REALLY THINK THERE'S
ANY MORE MOVING ON FOR ME.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.963
THAT SHOW WAS
THE LAST CHAPTER OF MY LIFE.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.842
- I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.970
BECAUSE I WAS EAVESDROPPING.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.639
- UNBELIEVABLE.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.100
- APRYL...

17:40.184 --> 17:43.937
LET ME BE THE NEXT CHAPTER
IN YOUR LIFE.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.147
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.940
- WHAT?

17:47.024 --> 17:51.487
- AS YOU DON'T KNOW,
BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER TOLD YOU...

17:51.570 --> 17:53.322
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.283
- OH. AND I YOU.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.661
OF COURSE I'LL MARRY YOU.
- OOH.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.623
- TO RECAP,
SHE SAID "YES."

18:02.706 --> 18:03.665
- YES!

18:03.749 --> 18:06.919
both: AW!

18:07.002 --> 18:09.838
- HAVE YOU BEEN EAVESDROPPING
THIS ENTIRE TIME?

18:12.424 --> 18:15.844
- HOW TERRIBLY RUDE!

18:21.934 --> 18:23.227
- WELL, I FOR ONE
AM GOING TO LOOK

18:23.310 --> 18:25.813
AT HONOR ST. RAVEN'S DEATH
AS A NEW BEGINNING.

18:25.896 --> 18:29.024
IF <i> CHEERS</i> HADN'T ENDED,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD <i> BECKER.</i>

18:29.107 --> 18:33.570
IN WHICH I PLAYED A WOMAN
WHO BECKER FOUND STUFFY.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.406
- ELKA, IF YOU WANT
TO SAVE YOUR LIPSTICK,

18:36.490 --> 18:37.199
YOU SHOULDN'T
BLOT YOUR LIPS.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.326
- I DIDN'T.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.370
THAT'S MY COLOR.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.747
IT'S A WEIRD LIP PRINT.

18:43.831 --> 18:47.209
- AH, THAT IS MINE.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.838
AND IT'S NOT
A LIP PRINT.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.381
- PLEASE DON'T
TELL US WHAT IT IS.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.091
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOTHING BAD.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.218
IT'S JUST LIPSTICK
I USE FOR MY PECS.

18:56.301 --> 19:01.056
SO THAT MY NIPPLES
POP ON CAMERA.

19:01.139 --> 19:04.226
- YEAH, THAT'S
BURNED IN THERE.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.061
- DO YOU HAVE
MORE OF IT?

19:06.144 --> 19:10.524
- SADLY IT'S BEEN DISCONTINUED.
THIS IS MY LAST TUBE.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.110
- HOW MUCH?
- NO, NO, NO.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.404
NOT MONEY.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.657
HER.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.414
- DONE.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.083
- ELKA, YOU CAN'T
TRADE ME FOR LIPSTICK.

19:28.166 --> 19:32.129
- OH, PLEASE, YOU'VE GIVEN IT UP
FOR LESS THAN THAT.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.428
- WHAT DO YOU SAY, JOY?
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.764
- WELL, MAYBE
I WAS BEING UNFAIR.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.558
YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE PERSON

19:44.641 --> 19:46.268
AND I'VE HAD
A REALLY TOUGH YEAR.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.769
THERE ARE A FEW GUYS
I REALLY LIKED,

19:47.853 --> 19:49.771
BUT NONE OF THEM
WORKED OUT THE WAY I WANTED.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.940
I'M KIND OF AT A CROSSROADS
IN MY LIFE.

19:52.024 --> 19:52.941
YOU KNOW, TYPICAL VIRGO.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.445
- EXCUSE ME.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.071
[sighs] ARE YOU ONE
OF THOSE WOMEN

19:58.155 --> 20:01.241
WHO TALKS ABOUT STUFF?

20:01.325 --> 20:03.452
- YEAH, I TALK ABOUT STUFF.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.953
- YEAH.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.456
I JUST GOT DIVORCED
FROM SOMEONE WHO...

20:07.539 --> 20:10.918
