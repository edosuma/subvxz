Carrie Bradshaw.</i>

00:05.589 --> 00:07.874
<i>And lots of things were changing...</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:09.876
George, I'm not sure I can...

00:09.877 --> 00:12.095
- Well, sure you can.
- I'm breaking up with you.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.096
<i>For all of us.</i>

00:13.097 --> 00:15.013
<i>You're</i> dumping <i>me?</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:16.598
Yeah.
I hope you don't mind,

00:16.600 --> 00:18.501
but I will be telling people
that I broke up with you.

00:18.502 --> 00:22.388
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here patrolling the dance, Maggie.

00:22.389 --> 00:24.390
God, I wish I wasn't the one
to have to tell you this.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.159
Donna's trying to hurt us.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.394
"We" don't exist anymore.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.680
- So now what?
- Now you're my boyfriend.

00:30.681 --> 00:33.066
You do like her, right?
I know you like her. Say it.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.067
Yeah, I do.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.851
Hey. Hi.

00:35.852 --> 00:37.352
Hey. Hi.

00:37.354 --> 00:39.956
You can stop me
from being at "Interview"

00:39.957 --> 00:41.457
and seeing Larissa

00:41.458 --> 00:42.875
and being in Manhattan,

00:42.876 --> 00:45.460
but the one thing you can't
stop me from is wanting it

00:45.462 --> 00:47.422
and wanting a life that's mine.

It's still so cold,
and there's no end in sight,

01:45.773 --> 01:48.257
and there are no fun holidays
to look forward to.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.932
It was huge.

01:56.933 --> 01:58.934
Well, I can pack away
a lot of chocolate,

01:58.935 --> 02:00.570

with marshmallows inside.

02:00.571 --> 02:02.438
What up, Kyddshaw?

02:02.439 --> 02:03.706
- West.
- Hey.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.107
Wait. What was that?

02:05.108 --> 02:07.109
West. He's in
our American history class.

02:07.110 --> 02:11.113
I know who he is.
What he called us... Kyddshaw.

02:11.114 --> 02:12.665
That's our names, like, put together.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.300
Like a nickname?

02:14.301 --> 02:16.386
Yeah, I guess.

02:16.387 --> 02:17.503
Wait. We have a nickname?

02:17.504 --> 02:19.621
An actual nickname as a couple?

02:19.623 --> 02:22.842
It appears so, Bradshaw.
Or would that be "Kyddshaw"?

02:22.843 --> 02:25.461
Well, I think when you're talking to me,
it can still be "Bradshaw""

02:25.462 --> 02:27.930
but when you're talking
to us, "Kyddshaw."

02:27.931 --> 02:29.232
Ah, good to know.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.184
(Mouths word)

02:31.185 --> 02:32.652
You cold?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.071
Yeah. A little.

02:36.439 --> 02:37.690
Thanks.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.074
Mm-hmm.

02:41.110 --> 02:42.411
Hey, Kyddshaw.

02:42.413 --> 02:44.113
You knew we had a nickname?

02:44.114 --> 02:45.415
Sure.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.916
(Sebastian) You still trying
to figure that out?

02:46.917 --> 02:49.117
Once. I did it once.

02:49.119 --> 02:51.254
Well, that's awesome. I mean,
Rubik's cubes are impossible.

02:51.255 --> 02:54.540
No one can do them. Well, I did,
and I'm going to do it again.

02:54.541 --> 02:55.841
Watch and learn.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.210
I mean, you people won't be able
to actually learn

02:57.211 --> 03:01.263
how to do this, so...
Just enjoy.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.715
Excuse me.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.100
Sorry to interrupt.
Gotta get to my locker.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.503
I know you're deep into that square
thing, but I gotta get to class.

03:07.504 --> 03:09.939
Sorry.
I'm just kind of obsessed.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.023
What is that, anyway?

03:11.024 --> 03:13.859
A Rubik's cube.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.512
How could you never
have seen a Rubik's cube?

03:16.513 --> 03:17.747
I'm busy.

03:17.748 --> 03:20.099
Playing with balls?

03:20.100 --> 03:22.367
That came out wrong.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.288
Yes, lettering in three sports
does kind of take up all my free time.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.240
Can I try it?

03:27.241 --> 03:28.917
Sure.

03:30.827 --> 03:32.078
It's 6-sided as all cubes are,

03:32.079 --> 03:33.996
and you have to get each side
all the same color.

03:33.997 --> 03:36.048
Getting one or two sides
is very viable,

03:36.049 --> 03:38.000
but it could take a while
since there are six sides,

03:38.001 --> 03:40.086
- and the ratio of...
- Done.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.420
(Boy) Ooh!
(Boy chuckles)

03:41.421 --> 03:42.588
(Girl)H!

03:42.589 --> 03:44.006
That was fun.

03:44.007 --> 03:45.608
Who are you?

03:45.609 --> 03:47.343
West.
I'm in your chemistry class.

03:47.344 --> 03:49.512
I know that.
I meant how did you do this?

03:49.513 --> 03:51.681
Beginner's luck, I guess.

03:51.682 --> 03:53.358
I guess.

<i>very surprising in Donna.</i>

04:05.863 --> 04:06.996
Does that hurt?

04:06.997 --> 04:11.200
Oh, yes. But I like pain.
It feels <i>so</i> good.

04:11.201 --> 04:13.002
I aim to please.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.570
You <i>really</i> do, Walt.

04:14.571 --> 04:17.123
(Sighs) This might be
the best relationship ever.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.458
Really?

04:19.459 --> 04:20.625
It's not for you?

04:20.627 --> 04:23.913
No. (Chuckles) It's great.

04:23.914 --> 04:25.748
But...
I've only dated Maggie,

04:25.749 --> 04:27.300
so I don't have a lot
to compare it to.

04:27.301 --> 04:30.269
I've dated...

04:30.270 --> 04:31.354
Well, everybody.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.755
And usually I have to get
all dressed up

04:32.756 --> 04:35.608
and wear a pound of makeup
and act all <i>flirty</i> and <i>pouty,</i>

04:35.609 --> 04:39.477
but... with you, I can just be me.

04:39.479 --> 04:42.698

without so much makeup.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.033

04:44.034 --> 04:45.334
Really.

04:45.335 --> 04:48.504

a little bit more boob.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.290
(Laughs) Thank you.

05:08.291 --> 05:11.093

really all that flexible.

05:11.094 --> 05:14.347

05:35.869 --> 05:38.004
- Yeah.
- And dancing.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.121
I think you would, too.

05:39.122 --> 05:41.457
I would... (Laughs)

05:41.458 --> 05:43.092
I'm not sure I'm coordinated enough.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.010

05:45.012 --> 05:47.380

Don't want being in his good graces

Here.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.070
No. You should take it.

07:01.071 --> 07:02.253
No, I'll be fine without it.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.239
I like the idea of you in it.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.241

(Sobbing)

07:19.722 --> 07:21.924
Did he break up with you?

07:21.925 --> 07:24.777
Cheat on you?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.429
- Talk to Donna?
- No.

07:27.430 --> 07:32.284
- Then what's happening?
- He tried to give me his coat.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.036
And then we have a nickname.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.938
Okay, I'm still confused.

07:35.939 --> 07:37.573
He bought me chocolates
with marshmallows in them,

07:37.574 --> 07:38.958
which I love,

07:38.959 --> 07:40.743
and he has a house account
at the diner for me

07:40.744 --> 07:41.960
for French fries.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.646
Okay, you're going to have
to help me understand,

07:43.647 --> 07:45.130
how is this bad?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.883
Don't you see?
I-I like him.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.420
I really like him.
I'm... falling for him.

07:51.421 --> 07:53.171
Isn't that a good thing?

07:53.173 --> 07:56.808
I thought it would be.
Now I'm just scared.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.479
Because you have something to lose.

08:01.463 --> 08:04.533
I think I know why they call it
"falling in love"...

08:04.534 --> 08:07.102
'Cause it feels like
you're falling off a cliff,

08:07.104 --> 08:09.355
and falling off a cliff
is not a good thing.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.323
- You've seen Wile Coyote, right?
- He always survives.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.111
Because he's a cartoon.
If he was a real person,

08:15.112 --> 08:17.146
he'd break every bone in his body.

08:17.147 --> 08:18.863
Or you could be happy.

08:18.865 --> 08:21.834
Yeah. Or Sebastian
could break my heart

08:21.835 --> 08:24.253
or cheat on me or lose interest

08:24.254 --> 08:26.505
or move or get kicked out
of school or...

08:26.506 --> 08:28.524
Wow. You think a lot.

08:28.525 --> 08:30.309
Coming from the girl
who never stops thinking.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.676
Yeah.

08:31.678 --> 08:35.664
About my grades and how I have
to destroy that idiot jock west.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.383
Mouse, he solved a Rubik's cube once.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.750
That's no big deal.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.436
It <i>is</i> a big deal.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.854
Being able to solve a Rubik's cube

08:41.855 --> 08:44.440
directly correlates
to spatial intelligence,

08:44.441 --> 08:47.109
which means that idiot jock
might actually be smart.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.111
So who cares?

08:48.277 --> 08:49.478
I do.

08:49.479 --> 08:51.739
If west is competition,
then I need to know that.

08:51.905 --> 08:54.066
See? You need to know stuff,

08:54.067 --> 08:56.886
because knowing stuff
makes it all less scary.

08:56.887 --> 08:59.455
You know that Sebastian likes you.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.824
For now.

09:01.825 --> 09:04.794
Mouse, when I my mom died,
I didn't think I'd ever recover.

09:04.795 --> 09:08.197
But I am slowly recovering.

09:08.198 --> 09:09.832
But this...

09:09.833 --> 09:11.716
It makes me feel so fragile.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.053
I mean, what if I can't handle this?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.856
What... what if my heart's
not strong enough for this?

09:16.857 --> 09:18.474
For what?

09:18.475 --> 09:21.911
For love.

09:21.912 --> 09:25.114
So what are you going to do?

09:25.115 --> 09:27.483
Break up with him?

09:27.484 --> 09:30.935
Carrie, you can't sabotage this
because you're scared.

09:30.937 --> 09:33.038
Fear is a very good reason, I think.

09:33.039 --> 09:36.058
I just... what happens
if all this stuff,

09:36.059 --> 09:38.294
everything I think
and say and worry about

09:38.295 --> 09:40.729
comes out in front of him,

09:40.730 --> 09:44.617
and he just thinks,
"I don't need this"?

09:44.618 --> 09:47.369
I don't think Sebastian
is much for complicated.

09:47.370 --> 09:49.071
He likes <i>you,</i> Carrie.

09:49.072 --> 09:50.639
But maybe not all of me.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.359
So try to keep it light and fun.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.759
Have you met me?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.262
Yeah. As soon as I said it,
I thought, "yikes."

09:57.264 --> 09:58.681
(Slaps arm) Aw.

09:58.847 --> 10:01.350
(Laughs) Good luck.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.384
(Sniffles)

10:02.385 --> 10:04.270
Oh.

10:09.912 --> 10:12.031
Hey, look, it's the other half
of Kyddshaw.

10:12.032 --> 10:15.584
Hey. Yeah, that's me,
one half of the whole,

10:15.586 --> 10:18.871
not that I think of us
as a whole, but yeah. Hi.

10:18.872 --> 10:20.505
Everything all right?

10:20.507 --> 10:23.041
Yeah. Of course, of course.
Never better.

10:23.043 --> 10:24.877
It's weird seeing you here every day.

10:24.878 --> 10:26.579
Yeah, even weirder for me.

10:26.580 --> 10:28.965
I can't believe I will never
see Manhattan again.

10:28.966 --> 10:30.081
I could sneak you in.

10:30.083 --> 10:32.268
Nah. Feel like I should take
the punishment

10:32.269 --> 10:33.585
as the criminal I am.

10:33.587 --> 10:36.238
We are very different.
Yes, we are.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.772
So you wanna hang out local tomorrow?

10:37.774 --> 10:40.860
Um, actually,
I-I have to take my sister

10:40.861 --> 10:42.861
to the library tomorrow,
so I'm not quite sure

10:42.863 --> 10:45.463
of my schedule.
Uh, can we play it by ear?

10:45.465 --> 10:48.600
- Sure. Yeah.
- What?

10:48.602 --> 10:51.037
Nothing. I just know
you like to plan ahead

10:51.038 --> 10:52.154
and know what's in front of you.

10:52.155 --> 10:54.457
No. Not... not me.

10:54.458 --> 10:55.774
Not this girl. No.

10:55.775 --> 10:59.242
Loosey-goosey. Light. Easy.
Keep it simple. That's me.

10:59.408 --> 11:02.882
<i>Okay.</i> Great. Well,
let's play it by ear then.

11:02.883 --> 11:05.951
Good. Just like I like it.

11:05.952 --> 11:07.803
But it... it would probably be better

11:07.804 --> 11:10.138
if we meet up later in the day.

11:10.140 --> 11:12.725
No. You know what?
Forget I said that. Um...

11:12.726 --> 11:14.792
Let's just chat whenever
and see what happens.

11:14.794 --> 11:18.014
All right, of course. Well,
ball's in your court, Bradshaw.

11:18.015 --> 11:20.066
Good. Good.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.268
So I'll see you when I see you.

11:22.269 --> 11:24.604
Which is now. We have
American history together.

11:24.605 --> 11:27.972
- Remember?
- Yeah.

11:28.479 --> 11:31.360
<i>While Sebastian was willing
to let things lie...</i>

11:31.361 --> 11:33.695
<i>Mouse was not.</i>

11:34.780 --> 11:36.165
(Backpack thuds) Hi, Mrs. Daschle.

11:36.166 --> 11:39.118
Oh, hello, dear. You're here
to finish up your filing?

11:39.119 --> 11:42.588
Yes. Thank you for letting me
do this as extra credit.

11:42.589 --> 11:45.841
I find alphabetizing very relaxing.

11:45.842 --> 11:47.593
You are one of a kind.

11:47.594 --> 11:49.494
Yes, I am.

11:57.637 --> 11:58.888
(Gasps)

11:58.889 --> 12:01.857
Everything all right?

12:01.858 --> 12:03.508
Yeah.

12:05.844 --> 12:06.851
I'm number two.

12:07.347 --> 12:10.182
Number two
behind that idiot jock west.

12:10.183 --> 12:11.733
Apparently not such an idiot.

12:11.735 --> 12:14.953
Wow. Good grades and sports.
Zoinks.

12:14.955 --> 12:16.238
So what if he's in three sports?

12:16.239 --> 12:18.523
He's not that tall.
How good could he be?

12:18.525 --> 12:21.210
He's the best point guard
Castlebury's ever had.

12:21.211 --> 12:22.461
How do you know that?

12:22.462 --> 12:23.529
School newspaper.
Don't you read it?

12:23.530 --> 12:27.667
Did you know he takes his math courses

12:27.668 --> 12:30.252
I did not. The question is,
how do you?

12:30.253 --> 12:31.637
I looked at his file.

12:31.638 --> 12:34.674
Coming from experience,
you probably shouldn't do that.

12:34.675 --> 12:36.041
Of course I can.

12:36.042 --> 12:38.259
Mrs. Daschle gave me the job
of file assistant.

12:38.261 --> 12:39.812
Does she know you include snooping

12:39.813 --> 12:41.045
in your job description?

12:41.047 --> 12:43.282
I'm not snooping.
I'm learning.

12:43.283 --> 12:44.883
Apparently while I was dating Seth

12:44.884 --> 12:47.653
and destroying my G.P.A.,
I missed a lot,

12:47.654 --> 12:50.356
like west's good grades.

12:50.357 --> 12:52.607
And <i>that.</i>

12:54.610 --> 12:56.611
Ugh. It's almost too much to bear.

12:56.613 --> 12:58.697
What Maggie did to Walt was hideous,

12:58.698 --> 13:03.102
but <i>that...</i> That over there
is an abomination.

13:03.103 --> 13:05.371
How could Walt rub that
in Maggie's face?

13:05.372 --> 13:06.872
He's not exactly rubbing it
in her face

13:06.873 --> 13:11.844
since she's been faking sick
for half this week to avoid him.

13:11.845 --> 13:14.179
I don't know why she's so upset.
She made her own bed.

13:14.181 --> 13:15.414
Well, just because
you caused the problem

13:15.415 --> 13:17.249
doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.917
She made a mistake,
and now she's paying for it,

13:19.919 --> 13:22.137
right? (Giggles) Big-time.

13:22.139 --> 13:24.357
I don't think
Walt was very happy, either.

13:24.358 --> 13:26.141
I'm just sorry it ended this way.

13:26.143 --> 13:29.362
Walt with <i>that?</i>

13:29.363 --> 13:30.727
It's so awkward.

13:37.319 --> 13:38.693
But he's still our friend.

13:41.323 --> 13:43.909
My eyes! My eyes!
(Laughs)

13:43.910 --> 13:46.912
<i>Seriously,</i> what in God's name
do they have to talk about?

13:46.913 --> 13:49.448
Well, it doesn't look
like they're doing much talking.

13:49.449 --> 13:52.384
Apparently not.

13:52.386 --> 13:54.136
Your cashmere sweater
is so soft. I can't get enough.

13:54.137 --> 13:57.006
I know. I heard a Magnin
is having their winter sale now.

13:57.007 --> 13:58.641
I bet they have tons
of cashmere for sale.

13:58.642 --> 14:00.125
Then we have to go to the mall
tomorrow and shop.

14:00.126 --> 14:01.394
It's a date.

14:01.395 --> 14:02.427
Ah! This'll be fun.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.096
I love spending
my Saturdays at the mall.

14:05.098 --> 14:09.968
<i>Meanwhile, my Saturday
was looking a lot less fun.</i>

14:09.969 --> 14:11.771
So the tournament should last
till around 5:30,

14:11.772 --> 14:12.821
6:00 at the latest.

14:12.823 --> 14:14.406
You sure you're okay
if I take the car?

14:14.408 --> 14:17.109
Mm, it would be better
if I drove you, I think,

14:17.110 --> 14:20.746
to the city, and then Dorrit
could do research for her paper

14:20.747 --> 14:22.247
in a real library.

14:22.249 --> 14:24.283
The Castlebury library will be
just fine for both of you,

14:24.284 --> 14:26.584
and there is no way you are
driving me into the city.

14:26.586 --> 14:28.504
I've been really clear on that...
I know.

14:28.505 --> 14:31.207
That place is off-limits to me.
You made your bed.

14:31.208 --> 14:32.591
And now I get to lie in it.

14:32.592 --> 14:33.826
I just didn't know it was
gonna be such a boring bed.

14:33.827 --> 14:35.845
I can take comfort in the fact

14:35.846 --> 14:37.663
that you're safe
and I know where you are,

14:37.664 --> 14:38.881
and just think about
how much more time

14:38.882 --> 14:41.433
you have for homework and your sister.

14:41.435 --> 14:43.551
You guys can head
over to the library together.

14:43.553 --> 14:45.537
- Goodie.
- Fun.

14:45.539 --> 14:46.605
I'm a 15-year-old who has
to have her sister

14:46.606 --> 14:48.157
walk her to the library.

14:48.158 --> 14:49.774
I win for suckiest life.

14:49.776 --> 14:52.060
Um, I have to spend my Saturday
at the library

14:52.062 --> 14:54.863
responsible for you when I don't
need to be at the library.

14:54.865 --> 14:57.115
Oh, right.
Your life sucks the most.

14:57.117 --> 14:59.318
Carrie, you're lucky I haven't
leashed you to the house,

14:59.319 --> 15:01.370
and, Dorrit, you're lucky
I ever let you out.

15:01.371 --> 15:02.704
What have I ever done?

15:02.706 --> 15:04.522
I'm afraid to even imagine.

15:04.524 --> 15:06.992
So what did you decide
to do your school project on?

15:06.993 --> 15:08.127
Have you picked a date in history

15:08.128 --> 15:09.410
that means something to you?

15:09.412 --> 15:11.413
I bet she chose her own birthday
as the most important day

15:11.414 --> 15:12.864
in the history of the world.

15:12.866 --> 15:15.718
Did not. Some of us aren't
totally into ourselves.

15:15.719 --> 15:17.052
So what <i>did</i> you choose?

15:17.053 --> 15:18.870
Um... none of your beeswax.

15:18.872 --> 15:21.139
Jeez, Dorrit, just trying
to make conversation.

15:21.141 --> 15:23.424
Let's not and say we did.

15:23.426 --> 15:26.045
Okay, then. (Sighs) Let's head out.

15:26.046 --> 15:27.847
Have fun at the gym, dad.
I will.

15:27.848 --> 15:29.231
I mean, not fun fun.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.382
You know, just good, old-fashioned

15:30.383 --> 15:33.319
sports kind of fun.
(Chuckles)

15:33.320 --> 15:34.987
Not any other kind of fun.

15:34.988 --> 15:36.721
Why are you so weird?

15:36.723 --> 15:39.825
It's all right, dad.
We'll be fine.

15:39.826 --> 15:42.733
Go ahead.

15:47.633 --> 15:49.335
I think you xeroxed
the entire newspaper.

15:49.336 --> 15:50.703
We could have just stayed
at the library

15:50.704 --> 15:53.037
and looked at the microfiche there.

15:53.326 --> 15:56.709
But then I would have had to
spend the whole day with you.

15:56.710 --> 15:58.877
(Doorbell rings)

16:02.798 --> 16:04.098
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.250
Oh, look, floppy blond wonder's here.

16:06.252 --> 16:10.088
Come on in. I didn't know
you were coming over.

16:10.089 --> 16:13.091
Yeah, I just figured I'd play it
by ear and come on by.

16:13.092 --> 16:14.193
It's okay I'm here, right?

16:14.194 --> 16:15.728
Yeah, of course.
Your dad won't mind?

16:15.729 --> 16:17.813
Totally.
Not at all.

16:17.814 --> 16:19.097
Like your jacket, Dorrit.

16:19.098 --> 16:21.433
Don't suck up to me.

16:21.434 --> 16:23.369
And don't suck face in front of me.

16:23.370 --> 16:25.304
We wouldn't, ever.

16:25.305 --> 16:27.873
But if you wanna do your work
in your room,

16:27.874 --> 16:29.875
I wouldn't say no to that.
(Sighs)

16:29.876 --> 16:32.628
Going. Oh, and if you need me,

16:32.629 --> 16:35.113
well, don't.

16:35.114 --> 16:37.633
So... what should we do?

16:37.634 --> 16:39.784
You wanna watch a movie or something?

16:40.719 --> 16:41.954
<i>(The partisans' "no time" playing)</i>

16:41.955 --> 16:43.005
<i>♪ no time</i>

16:43.006 --> 16:45.558
<i>♪</i>

16:45.559 --> 16:47.176
<i>♪ no time</i>

16:47.177 --> 16:48.727
<i>♪</i>

16:48.728 --> 16:52.264
ugh. Okay, that music
is very distracting.

16:52.265 --> 16:55.067
There's nothing like rage
to keep it romantic.

16:55.068 --> 16:58.804
I'll go yell at her.
I'll be right back.

16:58.805 --> 16:59.887
Dorrit!

16:59.889 --> 17:02.139
Dorrit, seriously...

17:02.141 --> 17:06.161
<i>♪</i>

17:06.162 --> 17:10.281
(sighs) Crap.

17:15.392 --> 17:18.477
Thanks, and if she shows up,
please, please call me.

17:18.478 --> 17:19.478
Nothing?

17:19.479 --> 17:21.095
(Sighs) No.

17:21.097 --> 17:22.765
I've called everyone,
everywhere she hangs out,

17:22.766 --> 17:24.733
all her friends, everyone she knows,

17:24.733 --> 17:27.102
or at least everyone I know she knows.

17:27.103 --> 17:28.319
I'm coming to terms with the idea

17:28.320 --> 17:31.073
that I know absolutely nothing
about my sister.

17:31.074 --> 17:32.741
Okay, maybe if we go back
over the day,

17:32.742 --> 17:35.160
we can figure out why she ran.
She's Dorrit.

17:35.161 --> 17:37.111
She always runs.
That I do know.

17:37.113 --> 17:39.665
Maybe in this pigsty,
there's some clues

17:39.666 --> 17:41.899
about where she could have gone.

17:43.168 --> 17:45.905
Hey, your sister's kind of
obsessed with the sex pistols.

17:45.906 --> 17:48.090
Her jacket, her music, this newspaper.

17:48.091 --> 17:50.276
Yeah, she's really
into loud, angry music

17:50.277 --> 17:52.044
where you can't understand the lyrics.

17:52.045 --> 17:54.941
All this stuff is about
Sid Vicious and Nancy.

17:54.942 --> 17:57.983
- Why? Does that matter?
- What was her report about?

17:57.984 --> 17:59.718
Um...
An important day to her,

17:59.719 --> 18:02.371
a-a day in history that has meaning.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.423
I figured she chose
the day my mom died.

18:04.424 --> 18:07.109
- Wow. Morbid.
- Yeah, well, it's Dorrit.

18:07.110 --> 18:09.244
She didn't die
on October 12th, did she?

18:09.245 --> 18:11.030
No. Why? Is that the date she chose?

18:11.031 --> 18:12.097
I think so.

18:12.098 --> 18:13.415
Every newspaper she has
is about that day...

18:13.416 --> 18:15.117
October 12, 1978.

18:15.118 --> 18:16.368
Do you know what it means to her?

18:16.369 --> 18:17.820
No idea.

18:17.821 --> 18:19.204
Look, I think she chose
the day Sid Vicious

18:19.205 --> 18:20.655
killed his girlfriend Nancy
at the Chelsea hotel.

18:20.657 --> 18:23.492
Well, it's morbid, so very possible.

18:23.493 --> 18:24.610
Do you think that's where
she could have gone?

18:24.611 --> 18:26.355
Where? Do they have a concert there?

18:26.521 --> 18:28.280
No, they're both dead.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.232
He killed her and then
overdosed a few months later.

18:30.233 --> 18:32.134
Oh, morbid on top of morbid.

18:32.135 --> 18:34.119
Look, I think she went
to the Chelsea hotel.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.387
She got a book on the hotel
and all these articles.

18:36.388 --> 18:37.963
She wanted to go to
to the scene of the crime.

18:37.964 --> 18:39.975
A lot of the people who are
into the sex pistols go there

18:39.976 --> 18:42.204
- to be a part of it.
- Okay.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.480
Let's go.

18:44.481 --> 18:45.597
I can't just run off to Manhattan.

18:45.598 --> 18:47.126
My dad would kill me.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.734
What? We have to?

18:48.735 --> 18:50.319
Well, what if she's out somewhere

18:50.320 --> 18:51.353
riding her bike or something?

18:51.354 --> 18:53.305
I don't even know your sister,

18:53.306 --> 18:55.274
and I can guarantee
that's not what she's doing.

18:55.275 --> 18:57.493
Point taken, but what if you're wrong?

18:57.494 --> 19:00.195
Then Dorrit's wandering around
at the mall, and she's fine,

19:00.196 --> 19:04.602
but if I'm right,
then she's in Manhattan alone.

19:04.768 --> 19:05.951
You ready?

19:05.952 --> 19:08.981
<i>While I tried to figure out
my next move...</i>

19:09.147 --> 19:10.654
(Thwack)

19:11.656 --> 19:13.959
<i>Someone else was trying
to figure out his own.</i>

19:13.960 --> 19:15.044
(Thwack)

19:15.045 --> 19:16.906
(Exhales) So what should I do?

19:17.072 --> 19:18.514
(Thwack)

19:18.515 --> 19:20.766
(British accent) Please, Misti,
can I have some more?

19:20.767 --> 19:22.384
(Both laugh)

19:22.385 --> 19:24.803
Seriously, just ask her for another
one. Yeah, but that's the thing.

19:24.804 --> 19:26.438
I didn't even ask her
for the first one.

19:26.439 --> 19:28.974
Ohh, Tommy, you don't know
how lucky you are.

19:28.975 --> 19:31.193
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth,

19:31.194 --> 19:34.897
or in this case,
a foxy aerobics trainer.

19:34.898 --> 19:36.532
Just enjoy.
So what should I do?

19:36.533 --> 19:38.701
Should I...
Ask her out on a date?

19:38.702 --> 19:41.609
Send her flowers?
Return the favor?

19:41.610 --> 19:43.372
Are you crazy? Send her flowers?

19:43.373 --> 19:45.741
Misti has learned
the most important of lessons.

19:45.742 --> 19:47.659
"It is better to give than receive."

19:47.660 --> 19:48.827
I mean, for us men.

19:48.828 --> 19:50.879
I don't know. I mean,
it wasn't sex sex,

19:50.880 --> 19:52.297
but it was, you know...

19:52.298 --> 19:53.999
She serviced you, my friend.
Just say it.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.834
Yes, and, you know, that's a big deal,

19:55.835 --> 19:57.136
especially for a woman.

19:57.137 --> 19:59.421
Tommy, you have been out
of this game too long.

19:59.422 --> 20:01.473
Things have changed.
Women have changed.

20:01.474 --> 20:03.208
Oh. (Scoffs) They couldn't
have changed that much.

20:03.209 --> 20:05.144
Oh, they have. I mean,
if you don't believe me,

20:05.145 --> 20:06.678
just ask a woman.

20:06.679 --> 20:09.014
What kind of woman talks about sex?

20:09.015 --> 20:10.084
(Knock on window)

20:12.684 --> 20:15.237
Ask Larissa.

20:15.238 --> 20:17.156
(Blows kiss)

20:17.157 --> 20:19.658
Is that the woman who abducted
my daughter? Yeah.

20:19.659 --> 20:20.909
What is she doing here?

20:20.910 --> 20:22.883
We've been... we've been
doing it for weeks.

20:22.884 --> 20:23.946
She's an animal.

20:23.947 --> 20:25.932
Thanks for setting us up, by the way.

20:25.933 --> 20:26.968
I didn't set you up.

20:26.969 --> 20:28.700
Of course you did.

20:28.701 --> 20:30.169
That night at the limelight?

20:30.170 --> 20:33.107
Go on. Talk to her.
She knows a lot about giving...

20:33.273 --> 20:34.738
And then giving some more.

20:34.740 --> 20:37.319
I'm going to take a shower. Okay.

20:37.485 --> 20:39.260
(Laughs)

20:43.682 --> 20:45.517
Darling, well done.

20:45.518 --> 20:46.718
(Chuckles)

20:46.719 --> 20:52.126
(Indistinct conversations)

20:58.614 --> 20:59.982
What are you doing here?

20:59.983 --> 21:01.512
What do you mean?
I'm here every Saturday.

21:01.513 --> 21:02.701
No, you're not.

21:02.702 --> 21:04.069
I'm here with
the "for the blind bake sale"

21:04.070 --> 21:05.370
every weekend, and you're never here.

21:05.371 --> 21:06.822
Yeah, I am.
I run the meals over

21:06.823 --> 21:09.208
to the senior citizen home
on Saturdays, always.

21:09.209 --> 21:10.959
So you're also a do-gooder.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.495
Why are you suddenly
so interested in me?

21:13.496 --> 21:15.964
Up until that Rubik's cube,
you didn't even know I existed.

21:15.965 --> 21:19.384
Well, now I do. Now that I know
you're competition.

21:19.385 --> 21:20.975
Did you know you're number one
in the class?

21:20.976 --> 21:22.020
I did.

21:22.021 --> 21:23.388
Well, don't get too comfortable,

21:23.389 --> 21:25.507
because that number one spot is mine.

21:25.508 --> 21:27.676
Except you lost it to me.
Not for long.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.310
Admit it. I'm better
at the Rubik's cube than you,

21:29.312 --> 21:32.291
and I get better grades,
and that must be killing you.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.466
You are not better than me.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.468
You just wait.
By June, I will own you.

21:36.469 --> 21:39.154
Have you actually figured out
that Rubik's cube again?

21:39.155 --> 21:41.973
Please. What you did...
Beginner's luck.

21:41.974 --> 21:44.076
If you're so sure you can beat me,

21:44.077 --> 21:45.888
why don't we put it to the test?

21:46.054 --> 21:48.849
A cube-off?

21:49.015 --> 21:50.199
You're on.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.150
Meet me at the diner at 4:00.

21:52.151 --> 21:54.819
If you don't show,
I'll know you're chicken.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.705
<i>Oh,</i> I'm not chicken.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.707
And I hope you like losing.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.009
Losing?

22:01.010 --> 22:02.176
It's not in my vocabulary.

22:02.178 --> 22:04.198
Well, then you'd better look it up.

22:07.933 --> 22:10.168
<i>As mouse prepared for the fight...</i>

22:10.169 --> 22:11.970
I can't believe this was 60% off.

22:11.971 --> 22:13.338
You like it, right?

22:13.339 --> 22:15.941
<i>Donna prepared for the score.</i>

22:15.942 --> 22:17.378
It feels like <i>buttah.</i>

22:17.544 --> 22:18.810
(Chuckles)

22:18.811 --> 22:20.729
Why don't we take the sweater off

22:20.730 --> 22:22.231
and see how we both look naked?

22:22.232 --> 22:24.283
(Chuckles nervously)
P.S. I look amazing.

22:24.284 --> 22:26.034
Hey, hey, hey.

22:26.035 --> 22:29.154
I don't wanna rush this, okay?

22:29.155 --> 22:32.017
I don't want it to be
just about sex. Is that weird?

22:32.183 --> 22:33.758
Maybe a little.

22:33.760 --> 22:38.397
It's just...
After Maggie...

22:38.398 --> 22:39.531
I wanna feel like I really know you

22:39.532 --> 22:41.151
before we take the next step.

22:41.317 --> 22:43.969
Wow. That is weird.

22:43.970 --> 22:47.539
Every guy always just wants
to get into my pants.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.756
Can't say I blame them.

22:48.758 --> 22:51.393
Well, maybe this is better.
When it finally happens,

22:51.394 --> 22:53.001
we'll both know
we really knew each other.

22:53.002 --> 22:55.230
I guess.

22:55.231 --> 22:58.567
Now let's see you in that
ton sur ton jumpsuit you bought.

22:58.568 --> 23:01.353
Okay. (Giggles)

23:01.354 --> 23:02.437
What are you doing?

23:02.438 --> 23:03.822
Looking for the train schedule,
which is gone,

23:03.823 --> 23:05.490
because obviously Dorrit took it.

23:05.491 --> 23:07.609
We're not gonna take the train.
Driving's gonna be a lot faster.

23:07.610 --> 23:10.696
We're not going anywhere.
I'm going on my own.

23:10.697 --> 23:11.997
What? Why?

23:11.998 --> 23:13.365
We can be in the city
in an hour if I drive you.

23:13.366 --> 23:15.667
No, you've already caused
enough problems.

23:15.668 --> 23:17.252
Me?

23:17.253 --> 23:18.787
If you hadn't have been here...

23:18.788 --> 23:20.839
If I hadn't let you in,
I wouldn't have been distracted

23:20.840 --> 23:22.007
and lost Dorrit.

23:22.008 --> 23:23.292
You're blaming me.

23:23.293 --> 23:25.760
You can't just show up here
unannounced.

23:25.762 --> 23:27.763
You told me to play it by ear, Carrie.

23:27.764 --> 23:29.881
I was doing what you asked.
I didn't ask you to come here.

23:29.882 --> 23:31.433
You're always getting me in trouble,

23:31.434 --> 23:33.752
and now Dorrit's in trouble
because of us,

23:33.753 --> 23:34.937
because of you.

23:34.938 --> 23:37.639
She would've run either way.

23:37.640 --> 23:38.890
You don't understand.

23:38.891 --> 23:40.359
Every time we're together,
something happens,

23:40.360 --> 23:41.593
and someone gets hurt.

23:41.594 --> 23:44.529
Okay, so we're not talking
about Dorrit anymore.

23:44.530 --> 23:49.200
I shouldn't have let you in.
That was my first mistake.

23:50.152 --> 23:51.736
I just...
I have to go.

a little full of yourself.

27:13.975 --> 27:16.343
Damn straight. I wouldn't
want it any other way.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.595
And neither should you.

27:17.596 --> 27:19.680
A man like you should want
a confident woman.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.731
It would do you some good.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.135
I had a confident woman.

27:25.136 --> 27:27.071
Your wife?

27:27.072 --> 27:28.989
Carrie adored her. She talks
about her all the time.

27:28.990 --> 27:31.242
I am not talking
about my life with someone

27:31.243 --> 27:32.660
who took advantage of my daughter.

27:32.661 --> 27:34.411
I didn't know Carrie was 16.

27:34.412 --> 27:36.162
I just thought she had
a good dermatologist.

27:36.164 --> 27:37.982
But, you know, it didn't matter.

27:37.983 --> 27:41.818
Best intern I ever had.
She cared. So passionate.

27:41.819 --> 27:43.820
About going to parties?

27:43.821 --> 27:47.074
Yeah. We have a good time,
but we're also making something,

27:47.075 --> 27:48.542
<i>saying</i> something.

27:48.543 --> 27:50.877
"Interview" magazine comments
on the world, on fashion...

27:50.879 --> 27:53.597
She had a good internship
at a law firm.

27:53.598 --> 27:56.033
She wants to be a lawyer,
which I'm sure you didn't know.

27:56.034 --> 27:57.184
You didn't bother to find out.

27:57.185 --> 27:59.711
That's rich.
Carrie Bradshaw, a lawyer?

27:59.712 --> 28:00.771
Damn straight.

28:00.772 --> 28:02.890
You have no idea who your daughter is

28:02.891 --> 28:04.275
or what she wants.

28:04.276 --> 28:07.945
I know that she was a good kid
before she came to Manhattan,

28:07.946 --> 28:10.114
one who had real goals,
not pipe dreams.

28:10.115 --> 28:11.482
Just because they aren't
your dreams for her

28:11.483 --> 28:13.484
doesn't mean they aren't real
and unattainable.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.703
I know my daughter
better than some party girl

28:15.704 --> 28:17.187
who values clothing and clubs.

28:17.188 --> 28:20.724
My job isn't to let her go wild.
It's to keep her safe.

28:20.725 --> 28:22.042
No, your job is to let her

28:22.043 --> 28:23.877
become the person
that she wants to be.

28:23.878 --> 28:26.797
Welcome to the new world,
tom Bradshaw.

28:26.798 --> 28:29.032
There's a whole world of women...
Complicated women

28:29.033 --> 28:30.134
with our desires
and passions and goals,

28:30.135 --> 28:31.385
and your daughter is one of them.

28:31.386 --> 28:33.637
Carrie isn't a woman.
She's a girl.

28:33.638 --> 28:36.006
A girl's who's gonna grow up soon,

28:36.007 --> 28:37.975
and you can't stop that.

28:37.976 --> 28:41.345
I'm not trying to.
I just...

28:41.346 --> 28:42.762
I want her to grow up right.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.264
It's not a matter of right and wrong.

28:44.265 --> 28:47.934
It's a matter of who
and what she wants to be.

28:47.936 --> 28:51.671
She's a hell of a writer.
Did you know that?

28:52.823 --> 28:53.940
No.

28:53.942 --> 28:56.327
She writes about the world
in a very special way,

28:56.328 --> 29:00.781
like she's seeing it
and learning from it.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.750
She's got a voice.

29:02.751 --> 29:04.001
Let her use it.

29:04.002 --> 29:05.836
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

29:05.837 --> 29:07.435
to make a living
doing something like that?

29:07.436 --> 29:09.089
It's almost impossible.

29:09.090 --> 29:11.408
I-I don't want her to be disappointed.

29:11.409 --> 29:13.926
She can do it as a...
A hobby.

29:13.928 --> 29:16.213
But what if writing is her calling?

29:16.214 --> 29:17.715
If you don't let Carrie
explore the world

29:17.716 --> 29:19.183
and figure out what she wants to be,

29:19.184 --> 29:22.770
she'll never become the person
she's supposed to be...

29:22.771 --> 29:24.972
Someone who's happy
and loves who she is.

29:24.973 --> 29:26.389
Don't you want that for her?

29:26.391 --> 29:28.425
Of course I do, but...
No, no, there's no "buts""

29:28.426 --> 29:29.727
this is your moment.

29:29.728 --> 29:32.188
What kind of father are you gonna be?

29:47.056 --> 29:48.558
So I get why you wanted to come here,

29:48.559 --> 29:50.994
but I still don't get why
you're so into their love story.

29:50.995 --> 29:52.963
It's not very romantic.
They both died.

29:52.964 --> 29:54.531
So did Romeo and Juliet.

29:54.532 --> 29:57.634
And that's like the most
romantic love story <i>ever.</i>

29:57.635 --> 29:58.834
Yeah, I guess.

29:58.836 --> 30:00.604
It's two people who were
artists and passionate

30:00.605 --> 30:02.756
who couldn't live without each other.

30:02.757 --> 30:04.540
Plus Sid is kinda cute.

30:04.542 --> 30:06.275
Dorrit, he stabbed her with a knife.

30:06.277 --> 30:08.328
Because he loved her so much.

30:08.329 --> 30:10.497
They lived like
every day was their last.

30:10.498 --> 30:13.917
Yeah, and then one day, it was.

30:13.918 --> 30:15.301
You're always so afraid.

30:15.303 --> 30:18.187
There's a lot to be afraid of, Dorrit.

30:18.189 --> 30:21.308
When mom got sick,

30:21.309 --> 30:23.443
I swore to myself I would live big,

30:23.444 --> 30:25.879
even if it was scary
or scared other people.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.396
Well, that explains a lot.

30:27.398 --> 30:29.599
I don't care what happens

30:29.600 --> 30:31.767
'cause it could all just be
taken away anyway,

30:31.769 --> 30:35.989
even if you're a good girl
or do the right thing.

30:35.990 --> 30:38.107
I feel the opposite,

30:38.108 --> 30:40.710
like I have to be so careful
and worry about everything

30:40.711 --> 30:43.079
and everybody because
everything could just go wrong

30:43.080 --> 30:44.548
at any point.

30:44.549 --> 30:47.584
It could. Who cares?

30:47.585 --> 30:49.264
Can't just stop living.

30:51.287 --> 30:52.521
You know stuff.

30:52.523 --> 30:54.908
Got a lot going on
in this brain of mine.

30:54.909 --> 30:56.593
Yeah, me, too.

30:56.594 --> 30:58.678
That's one thing
we both got from mom...

30:58.679 --> 31:00.213
All this thinking.

31:00.214 --> 31:01.748
It's exhausting.

31:01.749 --> 31:04.070
(Sighs) Totally.

31:06.069 --> 31:08.071
You ready to head home?

31:08.072 --> 31:10.357
Let me just take a few more pictures.

31:10.358 --> 31:12.641
I think I saw some
bloodstains up one flight.

31:12.643 --> 31:15.999
Yeah, I'll be outside
for that, and, Dorrit...

31:16.165 --> 31:18.031
Don't worry.
I won't run away again.

31:18.032 --> 31:19.249
I promise.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.751
'Kay.

31:21.752 --> 31:23.586
Oh, and dreamboat?

31:23.588 --> 31:24.753
Sebastian?

31:24.755 --> 31:27.969
Way cooler than I expected
for a pretty boy.

31:32.662 --> 31:37.267
Welcome! Welcome to the cube-off

31:37.268 --> 31:41.021
of the 1985... season.

31:41.022 --> 31:43.857
You're giving this a name?

31:43.858 --> 31:45.362
This day will go down
in the history books.

31:45.528 --> 31:46.859
We're solving Rubik's cubes.

31:46.861 --> 31:49.178
Sure, try to make it seem
like nothing,

31:49.179 --> 31:51.576
since you know you're going to <i>lose.</i>

31:51.742 --> 31:54.116
Oh, get ready to be <i>schooled.</i>

31:54.118 --> 31:56.653
You know the rules.
No use of distraction.

31:56.654 --> 31:58.520
No taking a break for drinks.
No looking...

31:58.522 --> 32:00.585
Are we gonna do this or not?

32:03.359 --> 32:04.881
Let's do it.

32:05.047 --> 32:07.163
("Eye of the tiger" resumes playing)

32:07.164 --> 32:09.219
Go.

32:13.055 --> 32:16.006
♪ It's the eye of the tiger

32:16.007 --> 32:17.874
♪ it's the thrill of the fight

32:17.875 --> 32:23.650
♪ and he's watching us all
with the eye ♪

32:24.732 --> 32:29.069
♪ Of the tiger

32:29.070 --> 32:32.004
- I know I like girls. I just...
- Don't wanna bang us?

32:32.006 --> 32:34.156
(Exhales) What gave me away?

32:34.158 --> 32:36.559
Oh, honey.
I'm everyone's type,

32:36.560 --> 32:38.895
so if you weren't interested
in screwing me,

32:38.896 --> 32:39.912
something had to be up.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.397
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

32:42.399 --> 32:44.950
I really like hanging with you,
if you still want to.

32:44.952 --> 32:47.671
Sure.
But just as friends.

32:47.672 --> 32:48.925
You've been awesome.

32:49.091 --> 32:50.590
No guy has ever listened to me,

32:50.591 --> 32:53.759
cared about what I thought.

32:53.761 --> 32:56.474
But I like sex, and a lot of it.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.949
And... I'm not gonna be
able to give you that.

32:59.951 --> 33:02.017
I know myself, what I need.

33:02.019 --> 33:05.387
You're lucky.
I have no idea what I want.

33:05.389 --> 33:10.126
I won't say anything, Walt.
I promise. But are you gay?

33:10.127 --> 33:14.446
No. No, I've never been
with a guy or anything.

33:14.448 --> 33:18.567
But do you think you could be?

33:18.569 --> 33:21.321
I know I'm the last person
you think you could trust,

33:21.322 --> 33:23.622
but my older brother's gay.

33:23.624 --> 33:27.761
No one knows except for me.
My dad would lose it.

33:27.762 --> 33:31.898
He lives in Los Angeles now.
He's happy.

33:31.899 --> 33:33.261
I don't know what I am.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.287
<i>It was a hard thing for Walt to admit,</i>

33:38.288 --> 33:39.889
<i>but nice to share it with someone.</i>

33:39.890 --> 33:43.313
<i>The surprising thing was
the person was Donna.</i>

33:44.627 --> 33:49.098
Whoo-hoo! You lose.
(Whispers) Suck it.

33:49.100 --> 33:51.300
♪ Oh-oh, ah-ah-ah

33:51.301 --> 33:53.603
♪ ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

33:53.604 --> 33:55.904
you don't win a lot, do you?

33:55.906 --> 33:57.809
I win all the time at everything.

33:57.810 --> 33:59.209
Are you always this gracious?

33:59.210 --> 34:01.810
It was over a half an hour ago.
Nobody cares except for you.

34:01.812 --> 34:04.313
That might be true,
but I am just celebrating

34:04.314 --> 34:06.983
because this is my ride
back to the top.

34:06.984 --> 34:08.400
Valedictorian, here I come.

34:08.402 --> 34:09.703
You're an intense chick.

34:09.704 --> 34:11.170
Threatened?

34:11.172 --> 34:12.371
Impressed.

34:12.373 --> 34:13.956
But as much as I enjoy
your good sportsmanship,

34:13.958 --> 34:15.257
I have to go.

34:15.259 --> 34:17.826
Can't handle seeing the face
of victory in your face?

34:17.828 --> 34:20.212
No. I have to go pick up
my little brother.

34:20.214 --> 34:23.132
See, my mom works nights to give
my brother and I everything,

34:23.134 --> 34:24.300
and since my dad left us,

34:24.301 --> 34:26.201
I've had to take on
a lot of responsibility.

34:26.203 --> 34:28.003
You're from a single mother household?

34:28.005 --> 34:29.271
<i>Yep.</i>

34:29.273 --> 34:32.696
And you're black and an athlete.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.612
That's right. I'm like
a college admissions unicorn...

34:35.612 --> 34:36.908
The trifecta.

34:38.231 --> 34:39.449
What are you?

34:39.449 --> 34:42.385
A non-athlete Asian math genius
with two parents?

34:42.386 --> 34:44.386
Dime a dozen.

34:44.388 --> 34:47.668
Looks like I win after all.

34:49.826 --> 34:50.877
Wave good-bye to Princeton
and Harvard,

34:50.878 --> 34:53.882
because those are mine.

34:55.882 --> 34:58.083
(Door opens, bell jingles)

35:05.425 --> 35:06.725
Thank you.

35:06.727 --> 35:09.179
For what? For not
totally bailing on you

35:09.180 --> 35:10.229
when you yelled at me?

35:10.231 --> 35:13.682
Yeah, for that
and taking care of Dorrit...

35:13.684 --> 35:15.935
Taking care of me.

35:15.936 --> 35:17.336
I'm here for you, Carrie.

35:17.338 --> 35:21.119
I know. Just all I can think
in my head is, for how long?

35:21.659 --> 35:23.993
What do you mean?

35:23.994 --> 35:26.246
I wanted to be cool,
you know, easy breezy.

35:26.247 --> 35:27.413
Keep it simple.

35:27.415 --> 35:28.948
But that's not who you are.

35:28.949 --> 35:32.669
No. I'm complicated.

35:32.670 --> 35:35.705
Maybe even a little weird.

35:35.706 --> 35:37.005
And totally terrified.

35:37.007 --> 35:38.842
I know I don't say it
as much as you do,

35:38.843 --> 35:40.592
but I'm kinda terrified, too.

35:40.594 --> 35:43.099
- Really?
- Really.

35:43.265 --> 35:45.965
Oh. I don't know why
that makes me feel better,

35:45.966 --> 35:47.083
but it does.

35:47.084 --> 35:48.897
Me, too.

35:52.105 --> 35:53.522
I know this could all go wrong.

35:53.524 --> 35:55.307
Clearly, there are no guarantees.

35:55.309 --> 35:57.322
But I don't care.

36:10.573 --> 36:13.158
Um... ew. Gross.

36:14.661 --> 36:15.961
Can you take me home now, please?

36:15.963 --> 36:17.630
Yes.

36:17.631 --> 36:18.781
Yeah, let's get you guys home

36:18.782 --> 36:21.159
so your dad doesn't bust our asses.

36:26.915 --> 36:28.934
Did you get any good pictures?

36:28.935 --> 36:30.853
(Speaks indistinctly) Hey.

36:30.854 --> 36:33.522
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:33.523 --> 36:34.589
How was the tournament?

36:34.591 --> 36:35.941
Uh, we had to forfeit.

36:35.942 --> 36:39.445
Harlan had a date he didn't
wanna miss. Mm, sorry, dad.

36:39.446 --> 36:40.646
Yeah, that's okay.
(Bottle cap clatters)

36:40.647 --> 36:42.364
Wasn't the day that I was expecting,

36:42.365 --> 36:45.578
but... worked out all right.

36:46.852 --> 36:48.045
How'd everything go at the library?

36:49.175 --> 36:51.674
- Good.
- Yeah. Uneventful.

36:51.675 --> 36:55.526
- As in boring?
- No, as in fun.

36:57.881 --> 37:00.666
<i>They say that with knowledge
comes power,</i>

37:00.667 --> 37:04.953
<i>so it's safe to assume
the inverse is also true...</i>

37:04.954 --> 37:07.656
<i>"With no knowledge
comes vulnerability."</i>

37:07.657 --> 37:09.942
<i>What we don't know about
the people we love</i>

37:09.943 --> 37:12.311
<i>or what we don't know
about love, period,</i>

37:12.312 --> 37:13.812
<i>can be scary.</i>

37:13.813 --> 37:16.315
<i>But maybe that fear is okay.</i>
