00:02.600 --> 00:03.828
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:03.920 --> 00:06.037
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.120 --> 00:07.190
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:10.595
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:15.518
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.600 --> 00:17.616
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.871
<i>she changed the present,</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>and now our world is more
dangerous than ever,</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:28.277
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:30.591
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.680 --> 00:32.637
<i>So what are you
going to do with him?</i>

00:32.759 --> 00:34.376
<i>I think our time would be
better served</i>

00:34.400 --> 00:35.720
learning how to cure him.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.314
You should really talk
to Dr. Lamden.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.198
<i>Grodd's attacking him
psychically.</i>

00:39.280 --> 00:40.240
<i>He's paralyzed.</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:42.709
<i>Human weak.</i>

00:42.800 --> 00:44.837
We could make
a meta-human cure.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.056
There's gotta be something
we could do outside the box.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.754
<i>You shouldn't go
to your office.</i>

00:50.840 --> 00:51.910
- Not right now.
- Why?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.798
<i>How many times
has this happened?</i>

00:53.880 --> 00:55.519
52.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.056
If I want to stop Cicada,
I can't be so precious

00:57.080 --> 00:58.536
about getting
The Flash's hands dirty.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.472
Sometimes the ends
justify the means.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.517
I get that now.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.391
Can't move.

01:30.040 --> 01:34.478
Ladies and gentlemen,
we finally have our hands

01:34.560 --> 01:37.439
on the meta-human cure.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.397
Cool, cool.
It's not like I spent weeks

01:44.480 --> 01:46.039
in the frozen tundra
or anything.

01:46.120 --> 01:50.034
No, no, no.
I think that just people are

01:50.120 --> 01:52.271
waiting for
the inevitable "but"

01:52.360 --> 01:54.272
that follows
such a big statement.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.592
Mmm, no, it's done,
and thanks to Caitlin,

01:57.720 --> 02:00.713
we even have a way to deliver
our silver bullet,

02:00.800 --> 02:03.554
so no, no "buts."

02:03.640 --> 02:05.154
I believe
there is a big "but" coming.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.277
But we need to test
the cure on a meta-human.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.680
<i>Et voilà.</i>
There it is.

02:09.759 --> 02:11.558
What we need is to save

02:11.640 --> 02:13.279
the metas that
Cicada is targeting,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.296
because he's not gonna stop
killing innocent people.

02:15.320 --> 02:19.075
- Is the cure dangerous?
- Well, it's an untested serum

02:19.200 --> 02:20.760
that alters biology
on a cellular level,

02:20.840 --> 02:22.957
so until we try it out
on someone,

02:23.040 --> 02:24.076
we have no way
of knowing.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.816
When we started
working on the cure,

02:25.840 --> 02:28.878
we decided that it would always
be a choice, not a weapon,

02:29.000 --> 02:30.753
so all we need
is a volunteer.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.877
Well, there's quite
a conundrum, right?

02:32.960 --> 02:35.160
A meta-human volunteer when
the meta-humans in this city

02:35.200 --> 02:37.112
have been chased away by us
or killed by Cicada

02:37.200 --> 02:39.715
or incarcerated
at Iron Heights Prison, so...

02:39.800 --> 02:42.235
Nobody from either group
is gonna volunteer.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.471
No, these criminals
are not going to relinquish

02:44.600 --> 02:45.954
their powers, although...

02:46.040 --> 02:47.759
There's gotta be
somebody somewhere.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.833
Yes, on another Earth.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.310
Oh, I'll call Harry, see if
there's anybody from Earth-2

02:53.440 --> 02:54.576
- who wants to volunteer.
- Yes.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.876
Not really what
I was suggesting.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.376
Hold on,
you don't have to call Harry.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.880
Wait, why not?

02:59.960 --> 03:02.191
Because there's already
a meta here from Earth-2,

03:02.280 --> 03:05.637
one who might not
want his powers...

03:05.720 --> 03:10.237
although it might be pretty
difficult to talk to him.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.039
King Shark...

03:12.120 --> 03:13.679
you really think
you can cure him?

03:13.760 --> 03:14.910
That's the idea.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.276
Oh, Lyla, this is, um...

03:17.880 --> 03:20.031
my daughter, Nora.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.077
- Your daughter?
- Yeah.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.391
- I'm from...
- The future, I'm guessing.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.709
Weird, right?

03:25.800 --> 03:26.936
No weirder than
waking up one day

03:26.960 --> 03:30.476
to find out that your son
used to be your daughter.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.799
So, why King Shark?

03:32.880 --> 03:36.157
Dark matter levels vary
from meta-human to meta-human,

03:36.240 --> 03:39.472
but Shay Lamden's case
is the most extreme we've seen,

03:39.560 --> 03:41.916
so we think if we could reverse
the effects of a high level

03:42.000 --> 03:45.596
- mutation like his...
- You can help all meta-humans.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.196
Look, we know King Shark
has limited speech,

03:49.280 --> 03:52.830
but we're wondering,
could we try and talk to him?

03:52.960 --> 03:54.776
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna need his permission.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.393
Well, you're in luck, Cisco.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.949
Lately,
he's been quite talkative.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.517
<i>Look at these pictures.</i>

04:05.440 --> 04:08.399
- So peaceful.
- Mm.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.439
So beautiful.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.997
- So peaceful.
- It is, isn't it?

04:15.080 --> 04:18.596
You know, I never understood
why Wally went there.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.875
- Now I do.
- Well, it makes me wonder.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.350
I mean, is my baby brother
ever coming back from Tibet?

04:23.440 --> 04:27.036
Well, all I can say
is that he is more at ease

04:27.160 --> 04:29.755
- than he has ever been.
- Hm.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.116
And if that means
he wants to stay away from...

04:32.200 --> 04:34.999
The crazy
that is Central City,

04:35.080 --> 04:37.117
then, you know what?
So be it.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.634
Yeah.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.872
Well, I am glad
that you're back, Dad.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.156
We're all glad
that you're back.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.754
Mmm.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.355
Even Captain Singh is glad
that you're back.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.635
- Wha...
- I'll get it.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.712
No, no, no.
No, you will not.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.836
You will not.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.200
You have been on
crying baby duty

04:56.240 --> 04:57.993
for far too long, Joe West.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.880
So happy you're back.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.713
All right,
all right.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.677
Are we ever gonna talk
about this couch you bought?

05:06.760 --> 05:08.911
Another day, Joe.
Another day.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.354
Very expensive.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.954
I mean, it's nice.
Listen.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.117
So, Cecile...
Mm-hmm.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.556
Has brought me up to speed.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.791
Cicada... been very busy.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.117
Yeah, well...

05:24.200 --> 05:27.750
You know, Team Flash will
figure out a way to beat him.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.516
But Jonesy was helping him
right under our nose,

05:31.640 --> 05:33.757
and that got me to thinking,

05:33.840 --> 05:37.117
Cicada's eluded capture
for so long

05:37.200 --> 05:39.760
that I'm thinking that

05:39.840 --> 05:41.991
he's still getting help
from somebody.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.873
I want more coffee.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.474
I'm gonna make
some more coffee.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.553
Yeah, I'll bring you
a fresh cup.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.475
Normally we don't bring in
outside help, but we got wind

05:56.560 --> 05:58.920
that the top ichthyologist in
the country was doing research

05:59.000 --> 06:00.957
on cases just like
King Shark's.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.350
Actually,
I think you may know her.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.352
Dr. Lamden?

06:05.440 --> 06:06.954
Are you working
for A.R.G.U.S. now?

06:07.040 --> 06:09.191
Couldn't say no.
And please, call me Tanya.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.714
What about
Nautilus Laboratories?

06:10.800 --> 06:13.235
Director Michaels offered me
the opportunity to work

06:13.320 --> 06:15.789
with another Shay Lamden,
one afflicted with the same

06:15.880 --> 06:17.997
dark matter anomaly
as my late husband,

06:18.080 --> 06:20.549
only this Shay system
was causing

06:20.640 --> 06:22.950
his neural pathways to regress.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.032
I'm teaching him how
to communicate effectively.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.476
Are you saying his mind
is becoming more shark-like?

06:27.560 --> 06:29.950
It was, but not anymore.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.838
I stopped the regression
of King Shark's mind

06:31.920 --> 06:33.718
using a cerebral interface

06:33.800 --> 06:35.792
that stimulates
his neural outputs.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.837
I call it a telepathic crown.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.196
Kinda like the
M.A.D. 2.0 we built.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.280
That's brilliant.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.432
My husband,
the Shay Lamden of Earth-1,

06:44.520 --> 06:46.000
was a wonderful man.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.437
Now, I have the chance to help
another Earth's Shay Lamden,

06:49.520 --> 06:52.399
by giving him back
his human mind.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.358
And since Shay's current state

06:54.440 --> 06:57.080
requires him to be
in the water more,

06:57.160 --> 06:59.311
these earbuds allow me
to hear him

06:59.400 --> 07:01.232
underwater and vice versa.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.437
The telepathic crown
allows Tanya to get through

07:03.520 --> 07:06.354
to King Shark and curb
his violent behavior.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.591
Can we use the crown
to talk to him?

07:08.680 --> 07:10.478
Yes, but why?

07:12.040 --> 07:13.679
We think we can
make him human again.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.576
It's taken a lot of work, but
we think we figured out a way

07:17.600 --> 07:19.557
to transform
dark matter-infused cells

07:19.640 --> 07:21.120
back to their non-meta state.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.271
Now, all we need to do
is test it,

07:23.360 --> 07:25.750
so we came looking
for a volunteer.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.997
That could really work?

07:28.080 --> 07:29.673
So, can we ask him?

07:40.240 --> 07:44.154
Shay, a team from
S.T.A.R. Labs is here.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.596
They have something
you may want...

07:46.680 --> 07:50.674
a meta-cure
for your condition.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.275
Trust me,
their preliminary analysis

07:53.360 --> 07:55.750
on reversing meta-gene
transfigurations

07:55.840 --> 07:58.799
proves there is a strong chance
it could work,

07:58.880 --> 08:01.190
especially in
ichthyological prospects.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.350
No, I'm not just showing off.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.636
It's their research.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.519
Shay has
a wonderful sense of humor.

08:10.600 --> 08:15.436
So, are we supposed to call
him King Shark or Shay?

08:15.520 --> 08:18.991
Yes, I'm still here.
Uh-huh.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.390
I agree.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.079
Okay.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.754
You believe
this cure could help?

08:42.840 --> 08:44.752
Yeah.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.875
Where do we begin?

08:54.800 --> 08:56.120
This is Agent Michaels.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.159
I need every available soldier
at the aquarium now!

09:01.400 --> 09:03.312
- Dad?
- I'm fine.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.835
W-What was all that feedback?
I thought he was under control.

09:13.920 --> 09:14.920
I don't know.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.117
Nothing like that
has ever happened before.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.471
Maybe his neuroregression
finally reached the point

09:19.560 --> 09:21.756
where the crown
could no longer affect him.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.320
Shay could be lost forever.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.880
No, no, no.
We don't know that.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.753
Why don't you come to
S.T.A.R. Labs with us?

09:26.840 --> 09:29.400
We can use the M.A.D. 2.0
to boost the crown's efficiency.

09:29.480 --> 09:33.076
We need to find King Shark
before he hurts anyone.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.516
A.R.G.U.S. backup
protocols have been activated,

09:35.600 --> 09:37.114
but King Shark
could be anywhere.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.536
We'll re-task the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

09:38.560 --> 09:39.960
to work in circuit
with A.R.G.U.S.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.959
What's on your mind?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.554
Just wondering
if we need to rethink

09:46.640 --> 09:48.438
how we're going to catch him.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.274
Stop, that did not happen.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.073
Yes, it did.

09:53.160 --> 09:57.712
Look, my lips went numb,
and then they swelled up

09:57.800 --> 10:00.759
so bad it looked like
I had plastic surgery.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.718
- What did Wally do?
- He laughed, of course.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.393
The baby laughed.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.520
At least now I know I'm
allergic to Szechuan peppers.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.480
Dad, do you mind
if I work here today, actually?

10:12.560 --> 10:14.552
Might give us some time
to catch up.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.997
Well, you know I'm never
gonna turn that down, so...

10:18.080 --> 10:22.074
Uh, but, Cecile tells me
that you have

10:22.160 --> 10:24.800
a fancy new office?

10:24.880 --> 10:27.076
Yeah, yeah, it's just,
you know, the plumbing

10:27.160 --> 10:28.913
is really lousy and
I can't have water

10:29.000 --> 10:30.229
dripping on my laptop, right?

10:30.320 --> 10:33.518
Well, hey, uh, the guy that
expanded our guest bath...

10:33.600 --> 10:35.751
he did a really great job
and he's really affordable.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.639
- Let me give you his number.
- No, Dad, it's fine, really.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.677
Iris, if you don't
take care of this quickly,

10:40.760 --> 10:42.035
it could snowball.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.516
Here.
Let me just send it to you.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.080
Okay, yeah.
Yeah.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.914
Actually, yeah, you know what?
That's a great idea.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.536
Why don't you send it to me
and I'll head over there

10:50.560 --> 10:52.791
and see what I can do.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.195
- Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.839
Love you.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.957
Love you more.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.554
So, if we wanna
boost the crown's powers,

11:01.680 --> 11:04.115
we gotta get it
to talk to the M.A.D. 2.0.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.192
What about
a logarithmic code?

11:06.280 --> 11:08.840
Exactly.
You see, this is why we need

11:08.920 --> 11:11.674
more scientists on the team.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.319
Shay tells me that
all the time.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.636
Well, the guy knows
what he's talking about.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.712
All right, so,
why don't you use

11:17.800 --> 11:19.837
my workstation,
and I'll get this going.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.160
- Fascinating, right?
- Yeah, it should be.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.515
It's the merging
of technology

11:26.600 --> 11:28.193
and human consciousness.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.033
And shark,
but no, no, no.

11:30.120 --> 11:33.079
I'm referring to your
relationship with Shay Lamden.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.436
What do you mean,
"relationship"?

11:37.120 --> 11:41.114
The way your posture relaxes
when you're speaking of him

11:41.200 --> 11:42.536
and the way
your voice modulates...

11:42.560 --> 11:46.076
- it suggests a familiarity...
- Hm.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.800
Or something more.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.634
We're both marine biologists,
so we have a lot in common.

11:51.720 --> 11:55.475
I guess you could say
we've grown very close.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.153
But he's just my patient.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.640
Oh, of course.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.997
Look at that.
We have liftoff.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.640
They are actually talking.
You see?

12:04.720 --> 12:06.996
I knew these two crazy kids
were gonna make it work.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.952
They aren't just synching up.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.470
The M.A.D. 2.0 is acting
like an antenna,

12:11.560 --> 12:13.791
amplifying the
crown's psychic signal

12:13.880 --> 12:16.236
beyond anything
I could have imagined.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.516
We heard geek screaming.
How are things going in here?

12:18.600 --> 12:20.432
I just need to synch
the helmet to my earbuds,

12:20.520 --> 12:23.080
- and we're good to go.
- Left that in the cortex,

12:23.160 --> 12:26.073
in the main console,
by the monitor to the left.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.719
You know what?

12:27.800 --> 12:30.076
Come with me.
I'll show you.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.800
- Great work, Cisco.
- Oh, well, takes a village.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.200
But every village
needs a genius

12:34.280 --> 12:36.192
and that's me, so thank you.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.511
Now we just have to find
King Shark and talk him down.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.195
Why don't we get the cure
injector to Caitlin

12:41.320 --> 12:42.456
and make sure it's ready to go?

12:42.480 --> 12:45.393
Well, remember,
we gotta talk to him first.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.551
Right.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.836
<i>We got a hit on King
Shark. He's at the wharf.</i>

13:04.000 --> 13:05.639
Caitlin,
are you sure he's here?

13:05.760 --> 13:08.514
Oh, he's there.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.030
He's heading
straight for you.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.111
Nora, you're up.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.554
Done.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.472
Okay, systems are synched.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.120
Shay?
It's me, Tanya.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.510
These people are
only here to help you.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.239
<i>Please listen to them.</i>

13:26.320 --> 13:28.437
It's okay.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.079
I think it's working.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.994
I think you're right.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.754
Let's ask him...

13:37.840 --> 13:39.911
Shay, stop!
Please.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.236
Please. I don't know
what's wrong with him.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.074
<i>Barry?</i>

14:15.080 --> 14:18.551
<i>Guys, what's happening?
Where's Shay?</i>

14:26.840 --> 14:28.718
Shay?

14:28.800 --> 14:31.759
What is it?

14:31.840 --> 14:32.990
What's going on?

14:33.080 --> 14:35.436
<i>Is Shay okay?</i>

14:35.560 --> 14:37.153
He's human again.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.351
Where am I?
Who are you?

14:53.440 --> 14:54.576
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No, enough!

14:54.600 --> 14:56.512
- Just get off me!
- It's okay.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.716
They're friends.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.910
Tanya.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.151
Yeah, it's... it's me.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.111
I'm... me?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.237
How?

15:13.320 --> 15:15.152
We call it the cure.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.438
It's a serum that suppresses
dark matter in meta-humans.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.074
You're the first person
to take it.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.914
Well, except
you didn't take it.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.232
We, um, we gave it to you.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.352
My... my head
is still swirling around.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.717
Are you saying
I'm human again?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.678
Forever?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.638
Almost.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.792
We developed a cure to work on
the human part of a meta-human.

15:39.880 --> 15:43.840
The animal part of your brain
fought back a little bit.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.759
There's still some dark matter
in your pituitary gland,

15:46.880 --> 15:49.236
but with this new data,
we should be able to

15:49.320 --> 15:52.836
address the cure and the
next dose should be permanent.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.151
Monsieur Lamden,
I should introduce myself.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.118
Sherloque Wells.
You've probably heard of me.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.159
I have a question
I've been debating in my brain.

16:00.240 --> 16:04.234
What drives the King Shark?

16:04.320 --> 16:08.633
Is it the shark,
or is it the man?

16:11.440 --> 16:12.896
If you're asking should
I be held accountable

16:12.920 --> 16:16.596
for my actions,
my answer is simple.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.353
Yes, I should.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.435
I don't remember
how many people I hurt,

16:24.520 --> 16:28.196
or who,
but that's no excuse.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.680
What do you remember?

16:29.800 --> 16:32.872
Fragments.
Glimpses.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.960
One day, I was a scientist.
The next, I was trapped

16:35.000 --> 16:37.151
in that body and
everything felt heightened,

16:37.240 --> 16:39.471
like my emotions
were on steroids.

16:39.600 --> 16:43.560
And the rage...
there was so much rage.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.336
That makes sense.
A shark's amygdala triggers

16:45.360 --> 16:47.511
a huge emotional response
when it feels attacked.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.195
Perhaps that's why
you escaped today.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.913
You were frightened.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.072
I don't know.
Today felt different.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.352
I don't remember much before
I started using Tanya's crown,

16:58.440 --> 16:59.760
but since then,

16:59.840 --> 17:02.594
my mind and memory
have been much clearer.

17:02.680 --> 17:06.070
And I especially remember the
kindness that you showed me.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.554
What...

17:18.040 --> 17:21.431
What happened?

17:21.560 --> 17:23.631
The dark matter in
his system is replicating.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.633
Tanya, I'm sorry.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.354
Shay, I'm sorry,
but until this is over,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.955
we can't let you
leave S.T.A.R. Labs.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.680
Call me as soon as the cure

17:49.720 --> 17:51.096
is ready to inject him
a second time.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.589
We have to know if this works.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.920
- Barry?
- Yeah?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.496
When you said
you wanted me to call you

17:59.520 --> 18:01.352
it was so that
we could ask Shay

18:01.440 --> 18:02.874
if he wants to
take the cure, right?

18:02.960 --> 18:04.553
- Caitlin...
- 'Cause you know,

18:04.640 --> 18:05.776
out in the field,
you didn't really give him

18:05.800 --> 18:06.870
much of a choice.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.120
But that was kinda hard to do

18:08.160 --> 18:09.799
when King Shark
had you dead to rights.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.031
We had a way
of communicating with him,

18:12.120 --> 18:13.360
and you barely
gave that a shot.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.536
And we could have
tried again.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.075
I saved you, man.
What did you want me to do?

18:17.160 --> 18:18.696
- Risk your life?
- That's not the point.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.200
It should be.
We're a team.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.496
We're supposed to have
each other's backs.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.352
And we agreed, as a team,

18:23.440 --> 18:25.136
to wait for his permission,
but you didn't even do that.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.160
And look what happened.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.240
You're alive,

18:27.320 --> 18:30.040
and Shay seems
to like being human,

18:30.120 --> 18:32.237
so that's a win-win.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.193
Is that what you think
a hero does?

18:35.800 --> 18:38.998
Forces other people to do
what you want them to do?

18:39.080 --> 18:41.993
He was gonna eat you, Cisco.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.199
What was I supposed to do?

18:44.280 --> 18:48.354
We agreed that the cure
would never be used as a weapon.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.073
Tell me something.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.157
Did you change your mind
in the moment,

18:54.240 --> 18:55.993
or was this always
part of the plan?

19:05.240 --> 19:10.031
<i>♪♪ If I could turn back time,
I would do it all again ♪♪</i>

19:13.120 --> 19:14.236
Dad?

19:14.320 --> 19:17.199
I went by your office

19:17.280 --> 19:19.431
to talk to you.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.800
Dad, look.
I, um...

19:21.880 --> 19:23.792
Don't.
Don't try it.

19:23.880 --> 19:28.830
I heard about this crazy
time loop you all got stuck in.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.640
Cisco and Nora told me

19:31.720 --> 19:33.313
what happened
in every version,

19:33.440 --> 19:36.080
and although
I don't remember any of them,

19:36.160 --> 19:38.311
just knowing what did happen...

19:38.400 --> 19:40.471
You weren't scared?

19:40.560 --> 19:42.358
I don't know.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.033
I mean,
I broke into Cicada's home.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.834
Dad, I fought him.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.311
And as terrifying
as that was, I mean,

19:50.400 --> 19:52.278
at least I could
react to it, you know?

19:52.360 --> 19:54.716
But now... now that he knows
who I am, who my family is,

19:54.800 --> 19:57.360
I mean, he could show up
at any moment.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.113
I just, I...

19:59.200 --> 20:01.271
- I feel...
- Powerless.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.114
Yeah, I just...

20:04.200 --> 20:08.080
I don't know,
I can't go back there.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.994
Okay, get up.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.514
Dad, I just told you...

20:12.600 --> 20:14.353
I don't want to go back there,
you know?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.676
I'm not taking you there.

20:16.760 --> 20:17.989
Then where?

20:18.080 --> 20:20.117
Someplace where
I can show you

20:20.200 --> 20:23.113
how powerful you really are.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.512
Pack it up.
Come on.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.637
We gotta talk.

20:34.720 --> 20:35.995
Don't you know you shouldn't

20:36.080 --> 20:37.536
interrupt others
while they're brooding?

20:37.560 --> 20:39.836
Trying to get
my Oliver Queen on here.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.071
I ran some more tests
on Shay.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.277
The reason he doesn't remember
anything that happened

20:44.360 --> 20:46.716
this morning is because he
experienced a severe brain wave

20:46.800 --> 20:48.359
disruption in his frontal lobe.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.636
That's the feedback
that we all heard.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.474
So, that's why he snapped on us

20:53.560 --> 20:55.040
like it was
<i>Jaws: The Revenge?</i>

20:55.120 --> 20:57.157
A frontal lobe that
compromised would of course

20:57.240 --> 21:01.120
result in lack of control
over emotions and judgment.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.477
So you think maybe the
crown might have done this?

21:04.560 --> 21:07.029
No, that's the thing.
The crown is not the problem.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.736
The way the neurotransmitters
work in this device

21:08.760 --> 21:09.989
never would have caused that.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.520
So what you're saying is

21:11.600 --> 21:13.096
the telepathic crown
was working the whole time?

21:13.120 --> 21:14.713
Yes, so that
begs the question,

21:14.800 --> 21:18.077
what caused King Shark
to go berserk?

21:18.160 --> 21:21.358
Guys, hey.
Um...

21:21.440 --> 21:25.719
I just wanted
to apologize for earlier.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.235
I was definitely too harsh.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.276
No way.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.557
Caitlin.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.873
Hello, Flash.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.476
Cisco's cerebral scan
is clear.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.552
Mine is as well.
We are both back to normal.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.512
No more strings on us.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.597
Killer Frost says
she's sorry for that ice blast.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.114
That was Grodd, too.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.680
Now she's ready
for some payback.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.160
Yeah, me too.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.879
Do we have a 20
on our Simian Svengali?

22:19.960 --> 22:21.553
Data and company
are working on it,

22:21.640 --> 22:23.074
but Grodd's psychic abilities

22:23.160 --> 22:24.992
are helping him
conceal his location,

22:25.080 --> 22:26.355
so he could be anywhere by now.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.239
I thought every
square inch of A.R.G.U.S.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.710
was supposed to be
power dampened 24 hours a day.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.800
It is.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.714
Then how does
an 800-pound gorilla escape?

22:35.800 --> 22:37.598
Let me show you.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.514
I went through
our security footage.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.399
This is from the night
of May 22nd, 2018.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.358
- That's the night...
- Of the Enlightenment.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.919
DeVoe's dark matter wave
took down all tech

22:49.000 --> 22:50.116
in the surrounding areas.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.351
Luckily,
our generators kicked in.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.796
- But not for a second.
- One second.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.314
That's all Grodd needed

22:56.400 --> 22:58.240
to psychically implant
instructions in a guard.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.839
Instructions
to secretly shut down

22:59.920 --> 23:01.718
the power dampeners
in his cell,

23:01.800 --> 23:03.917
and find out any other
information he needed to know.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.832
So that's why
King Shark flipped out?

23:05.920 --> 23:07.957
Because Grodd was trying
to mind control him?

23:08.040 --> 23:09.360
Likely as a distraction.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.399
Grodd's only ever
controlled human minds before.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.597
He must have had a hard time
controlling King Shark

23:14.680 --> 23:16.273
because of the animal part
of his brain.

23:16.360 --> 23:20.639
So King Shark was trying
to resist Grodd's iron will?

23:20.720 --> 23:21.995
Respect.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.958
If Grodd's had his powers
for a year,

23:24.040 --> 23:25.599
why wait until now
to escape?

23:25.680 --> 23:28.070
It's probably no coincidence
that the first thing he did

23:28.160 --> 23:29.958
was steal the telepathic crown.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.110
Tanya did say she's been

23:31.200 --> 23:32.714
working on the crown
for a while.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.996
Grodd probably knew this
was his perfect opportunity.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.117
And it was thanks
to our tech.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.237
All right, well,
now that Grodd has the crown,

23:39.320 --> 23:40.993
what's gonna happen
when he uses it?

23:41.080 --> 23:44.471
It'll amplify his mental
abilities a thousandfold.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.950
Instead of just
being able to mind control

23:47.040 --> 23:48.793
a few people at a time...

23:48.880 --> 23:51.600
He'll be able to
control the whole city.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.870
Forgive me.
I'm intruding.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.553
Or am I?

24:06.640 --> 24:10.270
I see him out there and I see
you in here in the shadows.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.760
Why is that, I wonder?

24:11.840 --> 24:13.718
Can you blame me?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.234
You saw his hand transform.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.597
Yes, right.
"Shark Week!"

24:18.680 --> 24:20.956
Not something you see
every day, but no,

24:21.040 --> 24:23.999
I thought your
hesitation occurred

24:24.080 --> 24:26.311
before that moment,
not after.

24:26.440 --> 24:30.070
It was a slight hesitation,
but it was there nonetheless.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.834
Again,
why do you think that is?

24:32.920 --> 24:34.400
I don't know...

24:34.480 --> 24:37.791
No? Well, perhaps
I could be so bold as to offer

24:37.880 --> 24:40.839
a suggestion that
it is not the hand

24:40.920 --> 24:43.037
of which you were frightened,
but rather,

24:43.120 --> 24:45.840
it was seeing the face

24:45.960 --> 24:48.316
of the man that you love.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.393
I don't love Shay.
We're friends.

24:51.480 --> 24:54.154
All right, well, let's take
a look at that too, shall we?

24:54.240 --> 24:56.550
So this is a friend
from another Earth,

24:56.680 --> 24:58.797
for whom you left
a high-paying job

24:58.880 --> 25:01.031
and for whom you have
dedicated every waking moment

25:01.120 --> 25:03.680
of your life trying to help.
It doesn't quite add up.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.798
I can't love Shay.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.430
He's my dead husband's
doppelganger from Earth-2.

25:10.520 --> 25:13.592
How crazy would I have to be
to fall in love with him?

25:13.680 --> 25:15.399
No crazier than
marrying the same woman

25:15.480 --> 25:17.039
from five different Earths...

25:17.160 --> 25:18.992
I know.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.600
I'm very good
at marrying people,

25:20.680 --> 25:23.115
but not so great
at staying married.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.714
Along the way, though,

25:24.800 --> 25:27.474
on these countless Earths
and countless doppelgangers,

25:27.560 --> 25:29.552
I learned there is one thing

25:29.640 --> 25:32.678
that makes all of us unique.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.316
And if that

25:36.400 --> 25:39.950
is what you fell in love with,
well then,

25:40.040 --> 25:42.714
perhaps a face
doesn't matter that much.

25:58.360 --> 26:01.273
You missed
a beautiful sunset earlier.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.840
Too bad.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.480
- It's my favorite time of day.
- Mine, too.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.712
I almost forgot
what one looked like.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.237
Did you know sharks
are colorblind?

26:12.320 --> 26:15.870
When I was King Shark,
my world was dull and gray.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.230
And then I met you,
and everything changed.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.875
I thought you were avoiding me.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.792
I was,

26:29.880 --> 26:32.918
but not anymore.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.879
Tanya, are you disappointed
in me now that I'm...

26:35.960 --> 26:39.078
No, not at all.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.838
They say every sunset
is unique.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.357
Do you think that's true?

26:50.440 --> 26:52.397
Yes, I do.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.593
Dad, this is not
going to work.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.637
You haven't
even tried it yet.

27:13.720 --> 27:14.720
Look, I get it.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.656
I'm supposed to take out
my frustrations on that bag

27:16.680 --> 27:19.639
and somehow get over it,
but it's not that easy.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.074
To confront what ails you?

27:21.200 --> 27:23.157
No, it's not.
It's hard.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.056
I had to go all the way
across the world to do it.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.276
Are you talking about Tibet?

27:27.360 --> 27:28.874
I thought you went there
to see Wally.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.736
I did, but that's not
the only reason I went.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.592
I went there to heal.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.558
Is that why you were gone
for so long?

27:34.640 --> 27:37.553
Wally convinced me
to come east with the baby.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.280
He said that it would help me
repair my mind,

27:40.360 --> 27:42.670
my body,
restore this old soul of mine.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.831
So with Cecile's blessing,

27:44.920 --> 27:47.480
that's what I did.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.920
And did it work?

27:49.000 --> 27:52.118
I bent, baby girl.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.510
But Cicada
ain't going to break me.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.080
Ain't going
to break you either.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.514
Come on.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.073
Come on, Iris.
Show Cicada what you got.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.631
Break him, Iris.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.155
Break him!

28:21.320 --> 28:24.392
Yeah.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.193
What's happening?

28:28.280 --> 28:30.590
Our fuzzy friend is
climbing up the Broome Belfry.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.194
What is it with him
and that tower?

28:32.280 --> 28:34.237
'Cause it's at the exact
epicenter of the city...

28:34.320 --> 28:36.120
Making it the perfect place
to broadcast from.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.759
He's going to use the crown.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.196
And get inside everyone's
head in the city.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.633
<i>Hear your master, Humans.</i>

28:51.720 --> 28:56.237
<i>Soon,
you will only know my will...</i>

28:56.320 --> 29:01.270
<i>the will of Grodd!</i>

29:04.720 --> 29:07.394
How long before everyone's
under Grodd's mind control?

29:07.480 --> 29:08.994
A few minutes, maybe less.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.176
We need to dismantle that crown
and get it away from him.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.350
I can try talking to him.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.616
He's always had
a sweet spot for me.

29:13.640 --> 29:14.736
- Good.
<i>- The hell you will.</i>

29:14.760 --> 29:17.195
Nope, Killer Frost is gonna
be a hard sell on that one.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.033
We're immune
to his mind control, right,

29:19.120 --> 29:20.554
because we're speedsters?

29:20.640 --> 29:22.120
No.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.953
Okay, The Flash Museum
just straight up

29:24.040 --> 29:25.394
got a lot of stuff wrong.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.800
Wait,
but do you have any extra

29:26.880 --> 29:28.440
anti-mind control
headsets lying around?

29:28.520 --> 29:29.576
There's a few
in the workshop,

29:29.600 --> 29:31.114
but it didn't work
so well last time.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.873
Yeah,
but now there's two of us.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.616
I need you to run at him
as fast as you can

29:34.640 --> 29:36.233
- without reversing time.
- Okay.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.516
That'll get his attention.
What are you gonna do?

29:38.600 --> 29:40.353
An old trick.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.354
Get the crown!

30:16.040 --> 30:17.474
Dad?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.275
<i>We can't move.</i>

30:34.360 --> 30:35.714
The mental dampeners
are working,

30:35.800 --> 30:37.314
<i>but Grodd's too strong.</i>

30:37.400 --> 30:39.256
I'm trying to hack into the crown,
but Grodd won't let me.

30:39.280 --> 30:40.760
He's gonna kill them.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.594
Not if you turn me back.

30:43.680 --> 30:45.194
I can stop Grodd.

30:45.320 --> 30:48.950
He can't read my mind...
at least, not when I'm a shark.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.679
Can you do that?

30:50.760 --> 30:52.752
I mean, if we accelerate
the cell cycle,

30:52.840 --> 30:54.256
use something that
will prompt a return

30:54.280 --> 30:56.158
to the dark matter
cellular form.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.596
Right, right, perhaps
a vibration or a jolt, right?

30:58.680 --> 31:00.592
Yes, if it was strong enough,

31:00.680 --> 31:02.478
but there would be
permanent consequences.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.517
If we re-saturate
your meta-genic cells,

31:04.600 --> 31:05.776
that will eliminate
the possibility

31:05.800 --> 31:08.269
for you to transform them
back into human cells.

31:08.360 --> 31:11.114
He won't be able
to use the cure.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.830
Shay, if you agree to this,

31:14.920 --> 31:16.673
you'll never be human again.

31:16.760 --> 31:20.037
Tanya, I can save Flash,
the people of this city, you,

31:20.120 --> 31:21.976
and make up for some of the
horrible things I've done.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.639
I have to do this.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.676
I'm afraid of losing you.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.911
You won't.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.630
Well, is there
anyone in this room

31:33.720 --> 31:35.632
that can provide
a vibrational jolt?

31:35.720 --> 31:36.870
I'm doing it.

32:11.400 --> 32:15.076
<i>My mind grows.</i>

32:15.200 --> 32:16.350
<i>Soon,</i>

32:16.440 --> 32:19.512
<i>Grodd will rule this city,</i>

32:19.600 --> 32:21.193
<i>this world.</i>

32:21.280 --> 32:23.033
<i>And you...</i>

32:23.120 --> 32:26.796
<i>gone forever.</i>

32:32.840 --> 32:35.071
- King Shark?
- Huh?

32:37.000 --> 32:42.075
King Shark wants you gone!

34:17.199 --> 34:19.078
Oh, no.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.237
Guys, King Shark's not moving.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.879
When a shark
is turned upside down,

34:24.960 --> 34:26.393
it enters tonic immobility.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.072
<i>He's in a state of paralysis.</i>

34:28.159 --> 34:29.355
How do we wake him up?

34:29.440 --> 34:31.159
Don't sharks have
electroreceptor organs

34:31.239 --> 34:32.913
called ampullae of Lorenzini?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.356
It's how they detect
electromagnetic fields, right?

34:35.440 --> 34:36.998
Yes, it's how they navigate.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.275
And it will also
attract electricity, right?

34:39.360 --> 34:43.114
So if we can get enough
electricity to him, we can...

34:43.199 --> 34:45.096
- Electrify his ass back up.
- Electrify his ass right up.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.032
<i>- Barry!</i>
- Yeah, we heard.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.713
Time for another old trick.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.594
You okay?

35:43.440 --> 35:45.671
- Yes!
- Yes!

36:00.080 --> 36:02.072
Nothing to it.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.712
Long live the king.

36:15.280 --> 36:18.034
I know Grodd almost
turned all of our brains

36:18.120 --> 36:20.635
into scrambled egg,
but that Kaiju battle

36:20.720 --> 36:22.632
was the stuff of dreams.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.234
Seriously,
way better than anything

36:24.320 --> 36:25.754
I read in The Flash Museum.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.672
Now that
Grodd is safely locked up,

36:27.760 --> 36:30.400
what's stopping him
from getting out again?

36:30.480 --> 36:32.437
A medically-induced coma,

36:32.520 --> 36:34.113
one safely administered
by Caitlin

36:34.200 --> 36:35.520
and the A.R.G.U.S.
medical staff.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.751
Exposure to the crown
kickstarted Grodd's

36:37.880 --> 36:39.473
mental abilities
into high gear.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.074
They're growing even now.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.756
Fortunately, I realized that if
Grodd's brain remains inactive,

36:44.840 --> 36:46.320
he can't access
his mental powers.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.631
Add in newly-enhanced
AI power dampeners

36:48.720 --> 36:50.916
that upgrade to keep up
with Grodd's power.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.151
You're welcome, by the way...

36:53.240 --> 36:54.959
anything it takes
to keep the city safe.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.599
Speaking of
keeping the city safe,

36:56.680 --> 36:58.797
we couldn't have
done this without Shay.

36:58.880 --> 37:02.351
How'd you guys convince him
to turn back into King Shark?

37:02.440 --> 37:04.193
We didn't.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.919
He volunteered.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.117
And you can never turn him
back into a human?

37:08.200 --> 37:09.600
I don't think so.

37:09.680 --> 37:13.230
So he's gonna stay
King Shark forever?

37:23.320 --> 37:25.915
Well,

37:26.000 --> 37:27.912
the good guys won once again,

37:28.000 --> 37:31.152
and yet you do not seem like
you're really celebrating.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.799
Why that is?

37:32.880 --> 37:35.190
After all
that's happened today,

37:35.280 --> 37:37.840
I just wonder
how it will affect...

37:37.920 --> 37:39.912
Your relationship?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.469
Well, that's a big question,
I must admit.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.233
But you know what?

37:44.320 --> 37:47.711
You will figure it out,
both of you, together.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.871
If so,
we'll have you to thank.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.997
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Me especially.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.554
No, no, no.
I did nothing.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.176
No, you're right,
I did help quite a bit.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.839
The point here is simply this,

37:56.960 --> 38:01.000
and that is that whether
it's man or shark or...

38:01.080 --> 38:03.800
man-shark,

38:03.880 --> 38:08.716
the heart wants
what the heart wants.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.872
And so,
you must be open to that.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.873
Sounds like you've solved
life's greatest mystery.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.714
Well, that's what I do.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.111
If so,

38:21.200 --> 38:25.911
I hope one day, you find
what you're looking for too...

38:26.000 --> 38:28.276
maybe in another doppelganger.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.160
Of course.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.277
I'll leave you to it.

38:41.160 --> 38:45.313
<i>Tanya, you look sad.</i>

38:45.400 --> 38:47.471
<i>Why?</i>

38:48.520 --> 38:50.352
We found each other today,

38:50.440 --> 38:52.671
and now that connection is...

38:52.760 --> 38:55.992
<i>Still here.</i>

38:56.080 --> 38:59.039
Shay, what you did...

38:59.120 --> 39:03.831
<i>I would do it again
for you, my love.</i>

39:32.320 --> 39:33.959
Time to bend.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.799
King Shark
versus Gorilla Grodd?

39:50.880 --> 39:53.759
Are you kidding me?
I missed that?

40:02.560 --> 40:06.839
Are you sure you don't want
something a bit more grown up?

40:06.920 --> 40:08.912
Um, you take that back.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.959
This snack is a delicacy
no matter how old you are.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.599
Guys, hey.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.712
I just... Swedish Fish?

40:15.800 --> 40:17.712
I love those.

40:17.800 --> 40:22.636
Um, look,
I know today has been crazy,

40:22.720 --> 40:24.677
and I just wanted to
make sure that we're good.

40:24.760 --> 40:27.229
I know Grodd made you
blast me in the face

40:27.360 --> 40:30.159
but I also know
I kinda deserved it...

40:30.280 --> 40:31.475
same with being ice blasted.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.314
I shouldn't have used
the cure as a weapon

40:34.400 --> 40:36.198
and forced it on King Shark.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.351
I promise
it won't happen again.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.314
Apology accepted.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.392
Goober.

40:47.480 --> 40:50.837
And we know something good
did come out of today.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.559
We know the
meta-human cure works.

40:52.640 --> 40:55.200
And now we can use it
to help all of the metas

40:55.280 --> 40:58.193
in Central City and beyond.

40:58.280 --> 41:01.273
Maybe we start with Cicada.

41:03.080 --> 41:04.833
I'm sorry, what?

41:04.920 --> 41:07.276
I know, I just...

41:07.400 --> 41:08.754
people can surprise you.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.593
Today definitely
reminded me that.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.514
And like you've been saying,
everybody deserves a choice

41:13.600 --> 41:16.354
to be whoever they want to be...

41:16.440 --> 41:18.750
that includes our enemies.

41:19.360 --> 41:22.512
I think we should offer
the cure to Cicada.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.920
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
