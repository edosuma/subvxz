00:58.400 --> 01:01.400
If one falls, we all fall!

01:01.600 --> 01:04.599
If one falls, we all fall!

01:05.160 --> 01:08.160
If one falls, we all fall!

01:08.400 --> 01:11.400
If one falls, we all fall!

01:20.080 --> 01:21.680
Justice for our colleagues!

01:21.760 --> 01:23.400
Justice for our colleagues!

01:23.600 --> 01:26.600
- Justice for Karin!
- Justice for Karin!

01:28.960 --> 01:31.080
Justice for Karin!

01:31.280 --> 01:32.840
Justice for Karin!

01:34.240 --> 01:35.480
Murderers!

01:38.400 --> 01:41.160
Let him get out of there!
To leave!

01:42.320 --> 01:45.040
- Come out.
- Killer!

01:47.960 --> 01:49.120
Killer!

01:51.640 --> 01:53.440
Justice for Karin!

01:54.120 --> 01:55.400
Trust me.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.080
- You always say the same thing!
- Let me speak, please.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.560
Six months!

02:01.760 --> 02:03.640
He's been dragging our feet for six months,
Mr. Berthier.

02:03.720 --> 02:04.880
It is counterproductive.
We can not...

02:04.960 --> 02:06.920
Shut the fuck up!
Be quiet!

02:07.000 --> 02:09.840
What do we say to the rest?
What do we say to the rest?!

02:10.039 --> 02:11.680
You don't give a shit about us!

02:15.640 --> 02:18.360
Things!
You don't care about us! Say it.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.560
Let me go!

02:21.640 --> 02:23.200
We will stay
here whatever is needed!

02:24.680 --> 02:26.040
But I don't want violence!

02:28.240 --> 02:29.800
What the jodans!

02:30.160 --> 02:33.160
Where are they?
Where are they?

02:33.760 --> 02:36.320
Where are the riot police?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.160
We lower our visor!

02:41.080 --> 02:42.840
We advance to the objective!

02:49.120 --> 02:50.520
We won't move!

03:26.280 --> 03:28.160
That's it, Michal!
That's it, come on!

04:23.080 --> 04:24.680
We know that acidification,

04:24.760 --> 04:27.280
the transformation into acid
of certain carbon emissions,

04:27.360 --> 04:30.360
like that of cars
or industrial waste,

04:30.920 --> 04:33.560
is responsible for acidification
of a certain number of rivers...

04:33.640 --> 04:35.680
- Hello, Simone.
- Hola.

04:35.760 --> 04:36.640
How are you doing?

04:37.920 --> 04:39.240
Hello, Michal.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.440
- How are you? How was the trip?
- Fine, thanks.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.880
- Is he in his room?
- I think she's still asleep.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.360
- I'm going.
- Vale.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.480
Karin.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.840
I'm going to tell the judge

05:41.840 --> 05:44.040
what are you sneaking in
in people's rooms.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.680
He won't let you come anymore.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.680
It will not grant you any more permissions.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.280
What time do you have until?

06:06.480 --> 06:07.520
I have time.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.040
Everything will be fine.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.200
Don't worry, Mrs. Besaad,
You know how this goes.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.720
I'll be quick.
It's almost there.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.000
Wait here,
They'll come for you right away, okay?

06:26.080 --> 06:26.720
Vale.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.160
Excuse me.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.480
Is everything ready?

06:33.440 --> 06:36.280
Karin Besad
She is ready for the operating room.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.360
What's happening?

06:54.160 --> 06:57.120
I don't want you to get complicated
life with your daughter, work...

06:58.720 --> 06:59.880
Because I...

07:01.480 --> 07:02.360
Look at me.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.320
It's going to be long.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.200
What I'm saying is, if you want
stay a little longer in Arras,

07:09.920 --> 07:10.920
we can wait.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.800
But what are you saying?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.720
If I could go back there, I would.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.000
But I don't have the strength
to return to the factory.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.360
I'm sorry.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.440
Hey, we talked about it, I'll move.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.400
It is the best.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.200
It's only three months.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.280
As soon as he serves his sentence,
I will move to Brussels with you.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.240
You win...

07:43.000 --> 07:44.920
- We can take her now.
- Yeah.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.640
Vale.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.440
- Hola.
- Can you step aside for a moment?

08:03.600 --> 08:05.400
- Everything will be fine.
- Yeah.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.560
I love you.

08:09.000 --> 08:09.960
I love you.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.440
POLICE
PERMIT SCHEDULE

08:31.600 --> 08:32.840
A ver, haz zoom.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.760
What a psychopath.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.360
- Look at his face, look at him.
- It's scary.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.080
Wow eyes...
He seems to be possessed.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.040
I hope not
fuck your mother like that.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.840
The poor thing must have a terrible time

08:50.920 --> 08:52.840
Hurry, girls, they are waiting for you!

08:54.040 --> 08:55.520
What do you do with your cell phone?

08:55.600 --> 08:57.080
Taking a photo of Cannelle.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.040
I have told you that
no cell phones, okay?

08:59.120 --> 09:00.880
Come on, hurry up, girls!

09:11.360 --> 09:13.280
If you say again
something about my father, I'll kill you.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.320
As you have broken it for me,
I'm going to shit on your mother.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.640
- It has some marks.
- Damn, what do I do now?

09:19.200 --> 09:20.560
¡Come!
¡Come!

09:21.920 --> 09:23.680
Eat, damn it!
¡Come!

09:23.960 --> 09:26.040
¡Come!
As! As!

09:26.760 --> 09:29.640
- Eat, fuck, eat!
- ¡Selma!

09:30.880 --> 09:33.120
¡Selma, stop!
¡Ya basta!

09:33.320 --> 09:35.120
- What are you doing?
- She's crazy!

09:35.280 --> 09:37.280
- Shut up!
- You're like a goat!

09:38.160 --> 09:39.440
During today we will beat

09:39.440 --> 09:41.240
records in almost twenty
regions of the country,

09:41.320 --> 09:44.280
where the red alert has been declared
due to high temperatures.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.040
At five in the morning they have already
reached 26 degrees in Paris,

09:47.120 --> 09:49.640
29 in Bordeaux, 24 in Toulouse.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.600
Throughout the day they wait
reach 42 degrees in the capital

09:52.680 --> 09:54.600
Due
of climate change,

09:54.680 --> 09:57.080
extreme phenomena
Not only will they be more frequent,

09:57.160 --> 10:00.160
but also more
intense and longer.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.840
heat waves,
droughts and

10:02.840 --> 10:05.200
heavy rains
They will last longer in the future.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.200
What the hell are you doing here?

10:07.560 --> 10:10.560
...is producing more heat waves
and torrential rains,

10:11.920 --> 10:14.560
but a published study
in the journal Nature Climate Change

10:14.560 --> 10:16.680
states that these phenomena
extreme weather...

10:16.760 --> 10:17.880
Why did they call you?

10:19.120 --> 10:21.720
They call whoever pays, it's normal.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.400
- Has no sense.
-Think of Selma.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.000
Christian doesn't want to
scandals, that's how it is.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.080
But if you want to take care of it,
for me fine.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.520
No, since you have come...

10:31.760 --> 10:32.800
Christian...

10:34.720 --> 10:36.320
Selma goes to apologize.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.280
- Where is that girl?
- He has gone to the hospital with his mother.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.240
- You will call her tonight.
- It is not a good idea.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.640
It's better to solve it
in a friendly way, right?

10:55.720 --> 10:58.000
Are you aware of
What's going on, Selma?

10:58.720 --> 10:59.920
What are you playing for?

11:05.840 --> 11:07.880
Can you wait for us outside please?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.680
Can I be honest with you?

11:17.920 --> 11:20.920
With the case of your
father and the controversy...

11:23.240 --> 11:25.600
If it weren't for his brother,
we wouldn't have admitted Selma.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.000
Some parents have complained.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.440
And, until now, I have defended her,
but they have to understand it.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.720
We appreciate it.
It's a good opportunity for her.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.960
If they do something like that to you again,

12:09.640 --> 12:12.640
You call me, okay?
And you wait for me.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.400
Do you hear me?

12:17.840 --> 12:20.760
We agreed that the boarding school
It would be good for you.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.520
You love them
horses and nature.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.880
Does anything change if I say no?

12:25.760 --> 12:27.240
You won't change my institute.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.040
You just want to get rid of me.

12:31.320 --> 12:34.120
What's that for?
If you want to come home, say so.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.120
Anyway, between vacations
and the holidays will fly by.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.840
And we will have time to think
in the coming course.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.000
Do you want to go to the lake this afternoon?

12:53.400 --> 12:54.840
But we are in March.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.120
Can't we swim in March?

12:58.080 --> 12:59.360
I don't feel like it.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.920
And I'm going to see dad.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.080
It's not his turn this weekend.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.640
- Call him.
- No, no, it doesn't matter.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.600
Count to three.

13:14.040 --> 13:14.840
One,

13:15.400 --> 13:17.280
Two Three.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.880
But what the hell is this?

13:25.520 --> 13:27.160
I'm getting hungry.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.440
What nonsense.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.080
You're like a goat.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.800
- Does this help you sleep?
- Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
- Oh really?
- Yes, it relaxes me.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.600
There seems to be someone
chewing gum.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.560
- It's very disgusting.
- No way.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.400
It's fashionable.

13:45.480 --> 13:46.560
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.120
Es ASMR.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.400
Ah, it's worth it.
Yes of course.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.680
Oh really.
It takes you down to your pulse.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.400
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.560
If this helps you sleep,
I will make a similar video for your birthday.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.440
- What an idiot.
- That?

13:59.520 --> 14:01.880
- What have you said?
- You do not understand anything.

14:02.040 --> 14:02.880
Yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.040
I have heard you.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.760
What a boring game.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.440
Don't you give yourself cream anymore?

14:18.520 --> 14:21.280
Yes, it should.
Pass it to me, it's right there.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.640
Dad, I don't want you
you go to Belgium.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.360
Brussels is alone
the hour one, Selma.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
You can come whenever you want.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.800
And change of scenery.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.520
Selma...
After what happened at the factory

14:53.000 --> 14:54.160
I was left alone.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.760
The foils.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.840
Karin was the only one who supported me.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.200
And now he needs me.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.560
And I want to help her.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.720
Do you understand?

15:08.480 --> 15:10.040
How are you doing at boarding school?

15:10.560 --> 15:12.440
Have those girls left you alone yet?

15:12.720 --> 15:14.000
Or do they still bother you?

15:14.720 --> 15:16.360
Yes, they behave well with me.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.640
And I do better with Parmentier.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.120
Who is Parmentier?

15:23.800 --> 15:24.880
My horse.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.560
Do you have a horse?

15:27.600 --> 15:29.000
You are refining yourself.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.360
Just kidding, Your Excellency.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.680
While the pH of the rain
continues to decline in Latin America

15:41.160 --> 15:43.320
on the western coast of Colombia
rainfall has been recorded

15:43.400 --> 15:45.240
a thousand times more acidic than normal.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.120
Without the possibility of protecting yourself,

15:47.200 --> 15:49.280
animals
They were the first victims

15:49.360 --> 15:51.160
registered by the
authorities of the country.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.680
According to the INRS,
these levels of sulfuric acid

15:53.760 --> 15:55.560
They are corrosive
for skin, eyes

15:55.560 --> 15:57.440
and the respiratory tract
and digestive.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.640
Due, in part, to
hyperconcentration

15:59.640 --> 16:01.160
of atmospheric pollutants,

16:01.160 --> 16:03.040
community
scientist indicates that

16:03.040 --> 16:05.440
it could be a
irreversible phenomenon

16:05.520 --> 16:07.800
which is already heading to the northern hemisphere

16:08.080 --> 16:11.080
According to the UN, at 200 million
of victims of global warming

16:12.720 --> 16:14.360
hundreds will be added
of millions of

16:14.360 --> 16:16.400
refugees more in
the next ten years.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.480
In 2030, more than 1,500
millions of people

16:19.760 --> 16:22.760
They will not have access to drinking water
if this phenomenon continues.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.080
- I was watching TV.
- Always the same shit.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.960
Every day is the end of the world.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.120
And the same idiots always talk.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.400
It sure sells
more than a layoff plan.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.640
What does it have to do?

16:37.240 --> 16:40.040
You don't care about the planet, but
It doesn't mean it's not important.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.920
I guess it concerns me more.

16:44.640 --> 16:45.760
OK, very good.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.000
Toma.
So that later you have nightmares.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.320
at least you have
your relaxation videos...

16:50.440 --> 16:53.200
Wait, dad, stay.
I'll see it on my mobile.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.920
Finish watching the game.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.720
I'm not tired.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.400
Don't stay late.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.319
- Good night, sweety.
- Good night.

18:07.760 --> 18:08.600
Well, come on.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.800
Let's do the same.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.720
Toma.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.520
Forget something?

18:19.080 --> 18:21.280
If it keeps going like this, be careful, okay?

18:22.320 --> 18:24.680
Be careful with what?
Nothing happens here.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.440
- Are you OK?
- Yes I'm fine.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.680
Are you going to leave?

18:33.040 --> 18:33.840
Fuck!

18:44.360 --> 18:46.240
Hello, Marianne.
Is everything okay, Martine?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.360
- Hello, everyone.
- Hola.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.040
- Hola.
- Good morning.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Sorry, guys.
I smell like a wet dog today, huh?

18:56.200 --> 18:59.040
As long as it's not bleach
As in America, we are doing well.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.880
Today we are in good shape
humor, ¿eh, Bernard?

19:02.440 --> 19:03.880
- You are next?
- Yeah.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.640
- See you later, guys.
- See you later.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.640
Mr. Kleber?

19:17.720 --> 19:19.400
- That?
- 33.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.000
Gironde, Burdeos.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.640
Damn, Selma...

19:49.560 --> 19:50.520
Shit.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.760
Hello, I'm mom.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.120
Hey, I don't know anything about you.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.120
If you're awake,

20:19.200 --> 20:22.080
send me a message to
Tell me that everything is going well there.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.080
I miss you.
I love you.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.760
Change of plans.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.400
Listen, guys.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.640
A ver, Dejon, Revault,
Maillard, Bertinotti, you're not going out today.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.120
Because?
What does that mean?

21:19.200 --> 21:20.920
It means that your parents
They don't give a shit about you.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.080
So funny...

21:22.160 --> 21:24.680
All the ones I mentioned
They will spend the morning in the center.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.040
The rest, to the bus.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.760
Before going up, the
mobiles to the box.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.360
Come, go.
Hurry.

21:38.160 --> 21:41.160
...above the rest.
The other is behind.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.840
Is awesome...

21:43.840 --> 21:46.760
They look quite similar to humans.

21:46.840 --> 21:47.640
Yeah.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.040
Fuck.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.760
ACID RAIN CAUSES SOME DAMAGE

21:51.840 --> 21:53.040
It's close to my house.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.080
I have to go find Selma.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.760
Shit...

22:06.480 --> 22:08.960
Damn, it can't be
You have to check the entire building.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.280
Mira.
Mira.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.560
Look at this.
It's all over the roof.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.560
What a brown one.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.160
What's happening?
I'm on the job.

22:30.360 --> 22:33.360
Yes, I know.
Hey, I'm worried about Selma.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.160
I can't stop seeing things
on social networks.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.600
Are you coming for me and we will look for her

22:39.680 --> 22:42.240
We can't take her home
every time it rains.

22:42.680 --> 22:43.880
You don't have a car?

22:43.960 --> 22:46.520
Some asshole hit me,
it is in the workshop.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.320
I find it complicated, Elise.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.400
Damn, for one thing I ask of you...

22:50.480 --> 22:52.400
Hey, I already told you
that I am working.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.560
I can't leave.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.640
I have three months left,
I can't screw it up.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.480
Okay thanks.
Gracias.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.520
Call your brother,
He is the boss of his company,

23:01.640 --> 23:03.520
can leave
without having his balls touched.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.760
Okay, I can handle it.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.160
- Check it out.
- Yeah.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.560
Hey, Michal, it's going to rain again.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.280
- Let's go.
- I'm coming.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.880
Look at that, man.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.120
Parmentier, enough is enough.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.680
What's the matter?
Walk.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.640
- Selma, don't be left behind!
- Come...

23:36.720 --> 23:38.520
Stop for a moment.
Wait here.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.280
Selma, what's wrong?

23:42.880 --> 23:44.800
We can't be waiting for you.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.040
- Selma, get off, please.
- Coach!

23:50.040 --> 23:52.560
- What do we do?
- I'm coming. One second.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.120
I'm leaving with the rest
and then I'll come back for you, okay?

23:57.120 --> 23:58.920
Stay here, huh?

24:00.160 --> 24:02.000
Come on, go back to your place.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.680
We continue.
Come on, let no one be left behind!

24:06.040 --> 24:08.120
And you take away all my weekends.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.680
- This has to end.
- If she wants to see me, what do I do?

24:11.760 --> 24:13.440
She's older, she can decide.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.520
Of course, if you let him stay all day
with your cell phone and eat whatever you want...

24:19.760 --> 24:21.440
She was almost kicked out of boarding school.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.640
Don't you want to know why?

24:27.920 --> 24:29.480
That center was a bad idea.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.560
- It's here?
- Yeah.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.280
- Come!
- You see it? I'm not the only one.

24:37.760 --> 24:38.640
You are welcome.

24:45.760 --> 24:46.680
For here.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.280
Now I come.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.800
The city of Lille has been confined,
as well as the surrounding areas.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.360
I can say that, for the moment,

25:14.440 --> 25:16.600
the pH analyzes carried out
on the coast of the English Channel

25:16.680 --> 25:18.560
have shown worrying results
but not alarming.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.400
However, we are concerned
for this phenomenon to intensify.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.280
Chemical risk assessment,
which is the main concern,

25:24.360 --> 25:26.480
It started a few minutes ago.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.160
As a precautionary measure,

25:28.240 --> 25:29.880
I ask the inhabitants
from the Haute-France region

25:29.960 --> 25:32.160
to remain in closed spaces
and that, above all,

25:32.240 --> 25:35.240
don't take the car,
in view of the numerous traffic jams.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.480
The health department
of the region indicates that,

25:38.560 --> 25:41.000
in case of exposure
to the so-called "acid rain",

25:41.080 --> 25:42.920
It is essential to act quickly,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.160
and recommends removing
all contaminated clothing

25:45.240 --> 25:47.000
and get in touch
with emergency services.

25:47.160 --> 25:49.080
As a precautionary measure,

25:49.160 --> 25:50.560
tap water
is considered not

25:50.560 --> 25:52.240
suitable for consumption
until new notice.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.320
To the inhabitants of Pas de Calais
you are advised...

25:56.000 --> 25:57.280
- Starts.
- Where is Selma?

25:57.360 --> 25:58.240
Follow that car.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.280
- The Jaguar there.
- But where is Selma?

26:00.360 --> 26:01.400
Follow him, damn it!

26:05.280 --> 26:06.920
I already have the address of the stable.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.800
- Is far?
- Ten minutes away.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.800
Why have they been
taken on a hike?

26:11.120 --> 26:13.800
- You said it wasn't serious.
- Did Selma tell you that?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.240
What the hell is going on there?

26:47.800 --> 26:49.000
Selma must be there.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.400
What are you doing?
Elise. ¡Elise!

26:52.280 --> 26:54.680
Listen to me please!

26:54.760 --> 26:56.400
All access is blocked!

27:10.200 --> 27:12.040
Madam, please.
Lady!

27:12.400 --> 27:13.720
Lady!
Lady!

27:26.080 --> 27:26.920
Shit.

27:31.520 --> 27:32.680
¡Pare!
¡Pare!

27:37.280 --> 27:38.240
¡Michal!

27:38.680 --> 27:40.760
- Are you OK?
- It will rain! It will rain!

27:40.840 --> 27:42.240
- Start, let's go!
- Hold on.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.080
- Over there!
- Hold on!

28:13.720 --> 28:14.640
¡Parmentier!

28:20.360 --> 28:21.560
There is no path here.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.480
Shit!
We can't get through.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.720
- It's there.
- Is far?

28:26.120 --> 28:27.000
One kilometer away!

28:27.720 --> 28:28.880
Less than a kilometer!

28:29.480 --> 28:30.520
I'm going for her.

28:44.680 --> 28:45.880
¡Selma!

28:47.720 --> 28:49.000
¡Selma!

28:52.960 --> 28:54.040
¡Selma!

28:55.120 --> 28:56.120
¡Selma!

28:58.840 --> 28:59.800
¡Selma!

29:07.520 --> 29:08.560
¡Selma!

29:21.240 --> 29:22.320
¡Selma!

29:22.400 --> 29:23.360
Dad!

29:24.240 --> 29:26.280
- Dad!
- ¡Selma!

29:27.240 --> 29:28.880
¡Corre!
Fast!

29:28.960 --> 29:31.000
Dad!
Dad!

29:32.000 --> 29:33.280
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.880
- Where are the rest?
- Don't know.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.080
Stay here, don't move.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.120
Say?

30:04.200 --> 30:05.920
- Where are you?
- I'm with Selma.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.840
- Where we are?
- In the hangar!

30:07.840 --> 30:08.760
In the hangar!

30:10.120 --> 30:11.520
In which of them?

30:12.240 --> 30:13.600
Hurry, it won't last long.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.520
- Where are you?
- That?

30:16.520 --> 30:17.440
Where are you?

30:18.760 --> 30:20.760
Wait, I see you!
¡Back up, back up, Elise!

30:26.960 --> 30:27.840
Come here.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.080
Wait, join me.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.360
- Mother!
- Come on, stick to me.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.200
Get on, let's go!

30:40.280 --> 30:41.800
- Are you okay, Selma?
- Yeah.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.640
- Are you OK?
- Yes I'm fine.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.680
Start up, let's go!
Hold on.

30:59.000 --> 30:59.840
Be careful with that one!

31:05.080 --> 31:06.520
A guy is following me!

31:07.240 --> 31:08.320
Be careful, ahead!

31:09.360 --> 31:11.520
- We can't get through!
- To the left!

31:15.520 --> 31:16.360
¡Back off!

31:16.960 --> 31:19.480
We can't get through!
¡Back off!

31:20.320 --> 31:22.200
Move the car, damn it!

31:23.040 --> 31:24.240
Keep it up!

31:25.080 --> 31:26.720
Try it on the right!

31:38.360 --> 31:40.080
Close the door!
Close!

31:40.160 --> 31:41.840
- Is closed!
- Lock it, Elise!

31:42.600 --> 31:44.840
- What do we do?
- Don't let them come in! Don't let them come in!

31:48.040 --> 31:49.840
¡Back off!
¡Back off!

31:50.760 --> 31:53.400
- Mom, back off!
- Back up, back up, come on!

31:57.280 --> 32:00.120
- Are you OK?
- Yes. Start up, let's go!

32:01.600 --> 32:03.040
Be careful, grab them!

32:05.000 --> 32:05.960
Get out of here!

33:19.000 --> 33:20.760
That is.
Cover yourself well.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.320
Pass me the leash.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.200
- Don't let it get wet, eh?
- Toma.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.400
Grab it from below
and pull up.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.320
That is.
More. Perfect.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.440
- You got it?
- Yeah.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.240
Why did you go north?
The thing is fatal.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.880
We have had no alternative.
We have done what we could.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.800
Okay, okay, sorry.
Where are you?

33:41.920 --> 33:44.920
We are in a supermarket.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.920
In the parking lot.
50 kilometers north of Arras.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.760
You have to get out of there, do you hear me?

33:49.960 --> 33:52.600
I can't go there,
They have blocked the roads.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.760
You have to go east.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.400
Where do you want us to go?

33:55.640 --> 33:58.240
¡Philippe!
Philippe, please bring me the car

33:58.480 --> 34:00.320
Where do you want us to go, Brice?

34:00.400 --> 34:03.040
To the winery
Gauthier, my former partner.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.400
It is between Metz and Forbach.
I'll send you the address.

34:05.480 --> 34:06.640
Do you want us to go to Metz?

34:06.880 --> 34:09.440
The clouds are heading north,
the east is clear for now.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.600
We will be safe there.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.880
- It's 300 kilometers away.
- Wait, Brice...

34:12.960 --> 34:14.679
They say there is less risk
when it rains little.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.600
- ¡Brice, Brice!
- If your car doesn't arrive, tell me.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.880
- Brice, listen to me.
- But you have to tell me now.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.840
- I have to organize myself.
- Brice, listen to me.

34:23.679 --> 34:24.880
I'm with Michal.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.040
Because?
What do you do with it?

34:28.120 --> 34:30.000
My car is in the workshop,
has come to look for me.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.960
I don't understand you.
I could have gone after Selma.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.040
What did you want me to do?
Leave her in the rain?

34:34.120 --> 34:36.239
So, what can we do now?
I just want to fucking help you.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.960
Look, he's with
us, it is what it is.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.800
If you're going to continue like this,
Let's go somewhere else, okay?

34:41.400 --> 34:42.920
Get inside.
Do not touch anything.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.080
Don't touch the bodywork.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.199
Let's cover it.

34:56.560 --> 34:57.520
And good?

34:57.840 --> 35:00.080
- I do not know.
- Don't you know or don't you want to tell me?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.120
Dad, it's Uncle Brice.

35:21.840 --> 35:22.760
Dime.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.200
You have 300 kilometers to Metz,
Does your car hold up?

35:26.120 --> 35:27.520
Elise says she has suffered damage.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.640
- I guess it will come, yes.
- What do you suppose?

35:31.720 --> 35:32.880
Tell me if it arrives or not.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.320
If not, move forward as much as you can.
and I'm going to look for you.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.080
Yes, yes, I think it's coming.
Yes it comes.

35:38.160 --> 35:39.840
If dad can't come, I won't go.

35:40.160 --> 35:40.960
I know.

35:45.760 --> 35:48.760
This is Karin's voicemail
Besaad, leave me a message and...

36:13.040 --> 36:14.360
Okay, come on, we're leaving.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.160
I have not found
no refuge in France.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.120
They are all on the other
side of the border.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.280
The car is not going to hold up.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.760
At 500 meters there is an exit
that goes towards Namur.

36:50.520 --> 36:52.360
We won't get to your brother.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.360
I already know, Michal,
but I do not know what to do.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.640
Shit!

37:06.040 --> 37:07.360
Kick it!

37:07.640 --> 37:10.160
You have to hit it harder, Selma!
Come!

37:10.440 --> 37:12.320
That's how it is!

37:12.400 --> 37:13.600
- Help me!
- Come.

37:14.240 --> 37:17.240
Selma, listen to me!
Take it easy! Listen.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.040
Just knock on this door!

37:22.000 --> 37:23.160
That's it, Selma!

37:23.880 --> 37:24.960
Keep going, honey!

37:25.520 --> 37:26.360
Higher!

37:27.200 --> 37:28.360
Well done, darling.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.520
Are you OK?

37:40.120 --> 37:41.080
Ven.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.520
Cover yourself with this.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.560
We can't stay here.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.520
I'm thirsty.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.160
Let's go get water.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.040
What do we do in Belgium?

38:12.040 --> 38:14.280
Don't worry, it's just a detour.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.800
Be careful where you step.

38:27.800 --> 38:28.880
Is there someone?

38:35.680 --> 38:37.000
Wait.
Stay with me.

38:40.800 --> 38:41.960
Is there someone?

39:16.480 --> 39:17.440
Kitten...

39:19.600 --> 39:20.560
Hola.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.000
- Do not touch it.
- Don't worry, it doesn't do anything.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.640
We don't know where he's been.
Ven.

39:30.520 --> 39:31.920
Where are you?

39:32.040 --> 39:34.680
I don't know, we ran away from the rain.
It's chaos.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.400
We have crossed the border.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.280
You can't be without me, huh?

39:41.600 --> 39:43.520
As soon as I leave Selma, I'll come for you

39:43.600 --> 39:45.880
Do not do it.
I'm fine here.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.920
Get to safety.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.360
But I want to be with you.

39:54.240 --> 39:56.320
When do you think you can...?

39:57.080 --> 39:58.560
I can't hear you.
What have you said?

39:58.640 --> 40:00.280
I can't see you.
Do you hear me?

40:00.360 --> 40:01.240
¿Karin?

41:15.800 --> 41:16.760
Have you found water?

41:20.240 --> 41:21.360
Is it tap water?

41:24.480 --> 41:25.520
Why did you do it?

41:26.560 --> 41:28.160
To know if it is drinkable.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.840
Do you want to take a risk?

41:32.040 --> 41:33.080
Am I right or not?

41:34.240 --> 41:35.040
Yeah.

41:35.600 --> 41:36.760
It's not a guinea pig.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.360
Come here.
For.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.560
What is in the fridge?

41:42.720 --> 41:44.720
Sweets and champagne.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.040
- I only found this.
- I can drink?

42:04.320 --> 42:05.280
No, thanks.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.800
Let's see, get up.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.400
Not bad, huh?

42:27.560 --> 42:29.800
- Aren't you going to eat more?
- No, calm down, you eat.

43:04.960 --> 43:05.800
Are you OK?

43:19.920 --> 43:20.880
No.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.680
Alcohol dehydrates even more.

43:25.400 --> 43:26.360
Whatever you want.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.200
Have you talked to the guy?

43:33.920 --> 43:35.280
He has arrived in Metz.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.960
He won't be able to come
today for us.

43:38.720 --> 43:39.920
It's too dangerous.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.680
- Are you abandoning us?
- No.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.440
He will come for us tomorrow.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.840
Will you come from there alone
for us?

43:46.920 --> 43:48.480
And if it can't, what do we do?

43:48.560 --> 43:51.280
- We'll do without him.
- We can't walk.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.200
We can trust him,
Honey, don't worry.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.560
And if the storm comes to the east,

44:00.440 --> 44:01.760
where will we go?

44:03.440 --> 44:05.800
Brice knows a lot of people,
He will look for something for us.

44:05.880 --> 44:08.880
I'm sure he has rich friends.
that can help us.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.080
We are lucky to have him.

44:11.440 --> 44:14.440
For people who don't have friends
rich, it is much more complicated.

44:15.160 --> 44:16.720
I see you haven't changed.

44:18.680 --> 44:20.000
It's not going to help you always.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.640
- And you help me?
- Parade.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.080
- What are you doing for me?
- What i do?

44:24.160 --> 44:25.920
- Yes. What are you doing?
- Ya basta.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.040
Where am I right now?

44:28.400 --> 44:29.600
- Where?
- Brice is the only one...

44:29.680 --> 44:30.600
Am I not with you?

44:30.680 --> 44:33.520
Brice is the only one
that can get us out of this.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.040
- The only one who can help you?
- Yeah...

44:36.120 --> 44:37.120
So why did you call me?

44:37.280 --> 44:39.200
Why did you call me?!
Responds!

44:39.520 --> 44:41.440
What have you done for
us these years?

44:43.040 --> 44:45.880
- That's why you hate Brice so much, right?
- Yes, okay. For.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.160
Because this time you won't be able to
throw it all away.

44:50.720 --> 44:51.920
What memories.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.280
Kitten.

45:27.720 --> 45:28.680
Kitten kitten...

45:30.440 --> 45:31.400
Kitten...

45:35.240 --> 45:36.200
Kitten.

46:31.800 --> 46:32.800
Come here.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.120
Give me your hand.

47:11.080 --> 47:12.000
Where is mom?

47:12.160 --> 47:14.720
On the phone with Brice.
Hurry, we're leaving.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.440
Come on, there's no time.

47:42.160 --> 47:44.440
What have you said?
I can't hear you.

47:46.880 --> 47:48.800
As far as it goes
police control?

47:53.840 --> 47:56.560
No, we just passed Chimay,
We are on the border.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.480
We go to Genetan.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.760
What if we cross the bridge?

48:06.600 --> 48:09.560
Can you pick us up on the other side?
Will you be able to pass?

48:11.520 --> 48:12.440
Vale.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.400
Do not separate them.

48:50.840 --> 48:53.160
The bridge is going to give way, don't push!

48:58.000 --> 48:59.640
Block it!
Block it!

49:02.680 --> 49:04.360
We can't let you all pass!

49:08.200 --> 49:10.600
Hey, be careful.
Señor.

49:10.880 --> 49:13.440
Mister! Hey, hey, stop!
Wait a while.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.560
Mother!
Mother!

49:18.000 --> 49:19.080
Mother!

49:24.280 --> 49:25.120
Mother!

49:26.160 --> 49:26.880
Mother!

49:33.680 --> 49:36.240
Close access!
Close access!

49:36.320 --> 49:37.920
Block it!
Block it!

49:38.320 --> 49:40.000
- Mother!
- Breathe, breathe.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.400
Mother!

49:42.480 --> 49:43.760
We can't let you pass!

49:46.400 --> 49:47.520
Advance, madam!

49:50.320 --> 49:52.280
Move forward, move forward!

50:02.360 --> 50:03.760
Don't fucking push my daughter!

50:41.680 --> 50:42.840
Mother!

51:03.520 --> 51:05.680
It has fallen!
It has fallen!

51:05.800 --> 51:07.840
Stay here, Selma.
Now let's go for her.

51:07.920 --> 51:09.640
- He has fallen into the water!
- Stay with me.

51:26.920 --> 51:28.840
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

51:30.760 --> 51:31.800
¡Selma!

51:54.840 --> 51:56.000
Mother!

51:58.880 --> 52:00.160
Mother!

52:02.400 --> 52:03.600
Mother!

52:05.600 --> 52:06.880
Mother!

52:07.480 --> 52:08.640
Mother...!

52:11.640 --> 52:12.760
Mother!

52:13.440 --> 52:14.560
Mother!

52:14.560 --> 52:16.960
Mom, come!
Mother!

52:17.040 --> 52:19.200
- ¡Selma!
- Mom please come!

52:19.800 --> 52:22.120
- ¡Selma!
- Mother!

52:22.400 --> 52:24.360
- ¡Selma!
- Mom, come!

52:24.600 --> 52:27.040
Mother!
No! Let me!

52:27.160 --> 52:28.520
Let me!

52:28.880 --> 52:30.440
Mother!

52:31.000 --> 52:32.680
Mother!
Mother!

52:32.760 --> 52:34.840
- For!
- Do not leave me! Let me!

52:34.920 --> 52:36.080
- For!
- Let me!

52:37.080 --> 52:39.520
- Come here.
- Let me!

52:39.520 --> 52:41.680
- You can not do anything.
- Let me!

52:46.480 --> 52:49.240
Mother!
Mother!

52:49.400 --> 52:52.400
Please!
Mother...!

53:59.520 --> 54:00.960
- Say?
- ¿Karin?

54:01.120 --> 54:02.720
¿Michal?
Do you hear me?

54:03.560 --> 54:04.720
Yes, I can hear you.

54:06.240 --> 54:07.560
I'm with Selma.

54:10.320 --> 54:11.520
Elise has died.

54:14.320 --> 54:15.520
I could not have done anything.

54:16.520 --> 54:17.720
What happened?

54:18.640 --> 54:20.320
Tell me, what happened?

54:20.960 --> 54:22.280
I can't tell you now.

54:22.480 --> 54:23.560
Can you give me a minute?

54:23.560 --> 54:25.360
You have to hang up
It's not a good time.

54:25.440 --> 54:26.480
Karin, what's going on?

54:26.920 --> 54:29.760
I don't know, they are going to transfer us
to another hospital.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.440
- Because? No...
- ¿Hola?

54:32.080 --> 54:33.280
I can't hear you.

54:34.720 --> 54:35.800
¿Michal?

54:35.880 --> 54:37.560
- ¿Karin?
- Guardelo.

54:39.120 --> 54:40.360
To what hospital?

54:40.600 --> 54:42.040
To the hospital in Antwerp, I think.

54:42.120 --> 54:44.080
You don't move from there, okay?

54:44.520 --> 54:45.440
I love you.

54:45.960 --> 54:46.920
I love you.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.520
Soy Brice Mazany.

54:55.600 --> 54:58.520
If you want to place an order,
Leave me your contact information.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.000
You can't be here, sir.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.520
For...

55:07.720 --> 55:09.360
To go to Antwerp
What convoy should I take?

55:09.440 --> 55:10.520
Nobody goes to Antwerp.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.200
And how can I get there?

55:12.360 --> 55:14.520
The closest is Fernelmont,
direction Namur.

55:14.600 --> 55:15.360
¿Fernelmont?

55:16.120 --> 55:18.000
How many are you?
You need red.

55:18.200 --> 55:18.960
Of the.

55:19.960 --> 55:21.320
- Thank you, very kind.
- You are welcome.

55:21.400 --> 55:22.840
Don't be late, come out now!

55:23.280 --> 55:25.600
Come, it's our turn.
Ven.

55:25.680 --> 55:28.680
- What are you doing?
- Let's take another convoy, Selma.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.120
No.

55:31.760 --> 55:33.800
- Where to?
- To Antwerp.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.320
Let's go get Karin.

55:35.520 --> 55:37.240
We have to go to Metz, like mom said.

55:37.840 --> 55:39.680
- With uncle.
- He doesn't pick up the phone.

55:40.280 --> 55:42.080
I have called him several times,
but he doesn't pick it up.

55:42.160 --> 55:44.360
- Call again.
- I just did it, honey.

55:44.480 --> 55:45.720
My voicemail goes off.

55:47.360 --> 55:48.840
We can't wait for you, Selma.

55:49.840 --> 55:51.400
You have to trust me.

55:52.280 --> 55:53.640
We are together in this.

55:55.600 --> 55:56.600
Come on, let's go.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.040
Come.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.400
Try to get some sleep.

56:52.560 --> 56:55.120
Let everyone get down!
Come on! You have to get off!

56:57.880 --> 57:00.280
The road is blocked,
we can't pass!

57:01.960 --> 57:03.760
You have to continue on foot!

57:03.960 --> 57:05.440
The road is blocked!

57:08.720 --> 57:09.920
Move on, let's go!

57:10.480 --> 57:11.840
Move forward, move forward!

57:11.920 --> 57:14.520
The Fernelmont refuge
It's five kilometers away!

57:14.600 --> 57:16.520
Wait, wait!
Come back here!

57:16.680 --> 57:18.600
Do not worry,
You will arrive soon!

57:18.840 --> 57:20.120
Come on, continue on foot!

57:21.160 --> 57:24.160
- Come on, don't stop them!
- Come on, hurry!

57:25.920 --> 57:27.960
Faster, come on!

57:39.400 --> 57:41.400
Don't stop, let's go!

57:45.640 --> 57:46.560
Come on, hurry!

57:46.640 --> 57:48.760
Faster!
Here! Come on!

57:48.840 --> 57:51.240
Come on, faster,
before it starts to rain!

57:51.920 --> 57:53.080
Come on, honey.

57:53.600 --> 57:55.320
We won't all fit.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.880
Those idiots are trying to tire us out.

57:58.240 --> 58:01.240
If anyone dies,
Better, they will have more room.

58:03.160 --> 58:04.040
Come quickly!

58:04.040 --> 58:06.240
Come on, honey.
Hold.

58:06.360 --> 58:07.640
Come on, hold on.

58:14.800 --> 58:16.320
- ¡Corred, let's go!
- Fast!

58:17.960 --> 58:19.960
We have to run.
Hold.

58:20.040 --> 58:21.520
- Come.
- Faster, faster!

58:22.680 --> 58:23.920
Hurry.
Let's go.

58:26.880 --> 58:29.000
No, Selma...
Selma, get up.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.200
- Let me!
- Get up, get up!

58:32.280 --> 58:33.680
- Let me!
- Get up, Selma!

58:34.600 --> 58:35.480
Fast.

58:38.880 --> 58:41.280
Selma, get up!
Let's go!

58:41.360 --> 58:42.160
Come.

58:52.960 --> 58:53.920
Shit...

58:54.880 --> 58:55.960
Where are you?

59:00.280 --> 59:01.400
Anyone there?

59:01.760 --> 59:02.600
Dad!

59:06.400 --> 59:07.400
Anyone there?

59:18.320 --> 59:19.400
Dad!

59:21.760 --> 59:22.840
Dad!

59:23.240 --> 59:24.320
Let's go.

59:39.200 --> 59:39.960
Ven.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.160
Take care of me.
That is.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600
Are you OK?

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.440
Shit.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.840
- Shit...
- Are you okay, dad?

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.720
Yeah.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.240
Wait.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.000
I have no battery left.
Shit...

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.920
You're bleeding.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.200
It's no big deal.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.480
We have to continue.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.080
You have to rest, dad.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.400
Anyone there?

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.920
Come, let's continue.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.080
What's happening?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.080
- What's wrong with you, Selma?
- On Bridge...

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.920
Why did you let him go?

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.200
Come here.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.520
Ven.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.800
We have to continue.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.600
You have to look for food.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.720
Dad!

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.880
Dad!

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.160
What's wrong with you, dad?

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.040
Aid!

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.520
¡Socorro!

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.760
¡Abridnos!

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.600
Open us up, please!
Aid!

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.960
Aid!

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.120
Almost!
Retry.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.840
Very good!
Keep it up.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.760
Are you OK?

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.600
Yeah, relax.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:10.840
Toma.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.160
- Where did you get it?
- It's not from the tap.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.440
Safe?

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.200
- You drink?
- Yeah.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.720
You have to heal your wounds.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.720
William, turn off the light.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:36.920
Gracias.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.600
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom, honey.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.840
Now I come.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.880
Be careful with the cable.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.920
What is your name?

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.880
Selma.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.320
Do you want to play?

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.640
Toma.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.800
- I'll be right back.
- Gracias.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.000
What are you doing?

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.880
Sorry.
I just don't have a battery.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.160
Try it if you want,
but it doesn't work well.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.600
My husband's messages
They take hours to arrive.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.240
How far are we from Antwerp?

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.200
100 kilometers to the west,
without counting the detours.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.400
Better go to Liège and there...

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.320
No, no, they are waiting for us in Antwerp.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.720
What is your shoe size?

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.000
And 43.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.560
I wanted to tell you...

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.880
It won't be long before we leave.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.960
I don't want problems.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.120
Me neither.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.080
What are you doing here?

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.480
- What have you touched?
- Nothing, seriously.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.680
- What did you hit?
- I swear I haven't touched anything.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.400
What's up, Selma?

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.640
- Don't know.
- Get out of here.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:42.240
- Come here, go.
- Get out of here, please.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.840
Have you not heard me?
I told you to get out.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.240
You can't stay up here,
it is dangerous.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.000
Do I have an alternative?

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.400
Open the basement door.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.440
Follow, follow.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.640
On the right.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.240
- Here?
- Closer.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.600
Gracias.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.080
Gracias.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.680
I will settle here with my son.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.440
Do you need anything else?

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.440
No, that's it.
Gracias.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.840
I have a garage,

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.240
If you want to stay the night.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.240
I do not know, we'll see.
Gracias.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.840
But I can't give you water or food,

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.200
I have to save it
for my son and me.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.160
I don't have much, sorry.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.040
Vale.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.720
Are there any neighbors left in the neighborhood?

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.200
Don't know.
I don't think so.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.200
I'm coming now, honey.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.800
What are you going to do?

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.479
Don't distract him.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.560
It takes a little while, but he can't move.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.279
What is the machine for?

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.560
It does the work of your kidney,

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.800
until I get a new one.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.880
Where do you come from?

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.000
From near Arras.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.160
William say that you
mother is with your uncle.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.399
Have you talked to her?

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.840
Maybe it's dangerous
that you leave tomorrow.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.600
Gracias.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.080
Can you give us a moment?

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.640
Mother.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.920
Hello Darling.
Are you OK?

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.120
I want to vomit.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.040
You will soon wear
better, I promise you.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.160
Hello my love.
I hope you're well.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.920
I'm fine.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.480
We have been inside for five hours
of a tunnel, but we're going to get out now.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:32.960
Tomorrow we will arrive
to the Antwerp hospital.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.400
I hope that...

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.920
Damn, there's barely any coverage...

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.720
I'm sure we'll see you soon,

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.480
whatever happens.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.400
I love you.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.920
What are you doing?

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.400
We will sleep here.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.960
I got something for dinner.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.160
Deborah said we can
stay a few days.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.760
I didn't know.

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.040
But people who don't
share the food...

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.840
- Better to keep her away.
- Don't you want to stay?

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.920
We will go to Antwerp for Karin.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.280
Walking?
Under the rain?

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.400
We can not.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.080
He needs us.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.560
Not me.
I will not go.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.960
You come with me.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.280
Have you called the guy?

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.320
I have already told you that
He doesn't pick up the phone.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.880
What a coincidence.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.800
It's no big deal.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.440
It will rain?

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.000
Do not worry honey,
It's almost over.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.680
- Why don't we eat ravioli?
- They are not ours.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.160
- What's happening?
- Anything.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.960
Did you want us to
had we run out of food?

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.520
I have done it for my daughter.
I'm sorry you don't like it.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.560
To Dad.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.480
Your mother didn't want
give us food, William.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.960
we have had them
to engineer, nothing more.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.360
You have excuses for everything, huh?

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.200
Finish your plate.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.160
we have to catch
strength for tomorrow.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.520
You should do the same.
Your house won't hold up.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.160
Like your neighbors.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.600
So stop making me dizzy
for some ravioli.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.240
Is it true, mom?

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.720
Are we in danger, Selma?

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.840
It's over, William.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.200
Ven.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.480
Leave it there.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.160
- Need help?
- No.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.000
Are you comfortable?

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.000
Doesn't your belly hurt?

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.680
Is what he says true?

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.400
That man is crazy.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.240
He just talks nonsense.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.800
But soon it will be gone.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.400
¿Vale?

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.640
Selma too?

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.240
William!

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.640
William!

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.040
William!
Open up!

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.560
William!

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.800
- Open up! Get out of there!
- You have to get out of there!

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.080
You have to go out!

01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.240
Open up!

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.360
Open up!

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.240
Get out of there!

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.520
William!

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.120
Move away, move away!

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.560
- Come out!
- Come here! Let's go!

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.120
¡Sueltame!

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.440
- ¡Selma!
- ¡Sueltame!

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.960
Miss William and Deborah!

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.280
- For!
- Let go! Let me!

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.360
- For now!
- ¡Sueltame!

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.320
William!

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.880
- For!
- Goes up!

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.320
- For!
- Lie down.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.120
- We can't leave them here!
- Lie down.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.680
Welcome aboard, Deborah.
Have a good trip.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:29.520
- Stay away from the window!
- Fuck! No!

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.120
I see nothing!

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.680
The electrical system
it does not work correctly.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.800
The electrical connections of
Your vehicle could be failing.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.640
It's going in the wrong direction.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.160
Please, of the
return as soon as possible.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:55.720
Attention, the electrical system
it does not work correctly.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.360
For your own safety,
the car must stop.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.080
- Fuck!
- What's happening?

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.640
- Don't know!
- Stop the car.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.280
- Don't stop now!
- Fuck!

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.360
- Stop the car.
- Why does it stop?

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.240
Stop the car.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.520
One moment,
we are working to solve it

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.320
Be quiet!

Head north

Take the path to the left.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.800
That's it, it's already started again.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.200
Continue along the indicated route.

Incorrect routing number, for
Please come back as soon as possible

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.760
The GPS signal has been lost.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.880

- You don't even know where we are!
- ¡Calla!

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.760
You shut up!

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.400
I said shut up!

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.600
Be quiet.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.200
Don't you see what's happening?

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.880
Shut up once and for all.

Shit!

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.880
Dad!

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:14.920
Fuck!

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.560

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.040
Get on top.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.640
Hold on.

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.400
Be careful, hold on.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.520
Careful!

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.640
Dad...

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.880

Please don't move!
I repeat: do not move!

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.600
I'm Laura.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.360
What is your name?

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.480
What beautiful flowers.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.640
Have you taken them?

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.400
I have found several
Mazany in the area.

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.920
But there is no "Bráis".

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.880
Mazany es M-A-Z-A-N-Y, ¿no?

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.600
Is the last name written like that?

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.560
Usually?

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.240
- Mazany, Brice, yes.
- Brice...

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.000

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.920
¿Karin Besad?

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.040
B-E-S-A-A-D.

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:34.720
¿Gustav?

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.040
That?

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.120
Do we have a psychologist or therapist

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.640
among the volunteers?

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.160
Psychologist?
Wait...

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.880
No, there doesn't seem to be any.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.960
- There is a doctor, but...
- No, it doesn't work for me.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.040
- I can help you if you want.
- No, I can manage.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.880
I'm sorry.

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.160
What's happening?

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.280

Very sorry.

- Hola.
- Hola.

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.560
Can I see my father?

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.040
Okay, but don't be late.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:23.960
All good?

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.160
Have they found her?

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:33.360
Not yet.

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.040
They have not been able to call the hospital.

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.480
I'll ask later.

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.520
Can you stay with me?

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.280
Clear.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.760
Sorry, I'm very tired.
