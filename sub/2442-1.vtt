01:06.600 --> 01:10.400
I have found almost everything
ever written about love...

01:10.600 --> 01:11.900
... to be true.

01:12.100 --> 01:16.100
Shakespeare said,
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."

01:16.300 --> 01:18.100
What an extraordinary thought.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.700
Personally, I have not experienced
anything remotely close to that...

01:21.900 --> 01:25.000
...but I'm more than willing to believe
Shakespeare had.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.500
I suppose I think about love
more than anyone really should.

01:28.700 --> 01:34.200
I'm constantly amazed by its sheer
power to alter and define our lives.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.400
It was Shakespeare who also said,
"Love is blind."

01:38.700 --> 01:42.700
Now, that is something
I know to be true.

01:54.500 --> 01:58.100
For some, quite inexplicably...

01:58.900 --> 02:00.400
...Iove fades.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.700
For others...

02:16.900 --> 02:19.000
...Iove is simply lost.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.900
But then, of course,
love can also be found.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.300
Even if just for the night.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.400
And then there's
another kind of love.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.100
The cruelest kind.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.000
The one that almost kills its victims.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.100
It's called unrequited love.

02:47.300 --> 02:51.400
Of that, I am an expert..

02:51.900 --> 02:55.700
Most love stories are about people
who fall in love with each other.

02:55.900 --> 02:59.200
But what about the rest of us?
What about our stories?

02:59.400 --> 03:01.800
Those of us who fall in love alone.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.100
We are the victims
of the one-sided affair.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.200
We are the cursed
of the loved ones.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.100
We are the unloved ones.
The walking wounded.

03:10.300 --> 03:13.800
The handicapped without the
advantage of a great parking space.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.500
Yes, you are looking at one
such individual.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.700
And I have willingly loved...

03:18.900 --> 03:22.700
... that man for over
three miserable years.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.200
The absolute worst years of my life.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.600
The worst Christmases,
the worst birt.hdays.

03:27.800 --> 03:31.400
New Year's Eves brought in
by tears and Valium.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.600
These years I've been in love have
been the darkest days of my life...

03:35.800 --> 03:39.000
...all because I'm cursed by being
in love with a man who does not...

03:39.200 --> 03:41.600
...and will not love me back.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.300
Oh, God, just the sight of him.

03:43.500 --> 03:47.000
Heart. pounding, throat thickening,
absolutely can't swallow.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.900
All the usual symptoms.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.800
Oh, Jasper.

03:52.100 --> 03:56.500
-Don't tell me you're still...
-No, no, no, that's over. very over.

03:56.700 --> 04:00.000
What's the story with you two anyway?
You were shagging him, weren't you?

04:00.200 --> 04:02.700
More importantly, I was in love
with him, truth be known.

04:02.900 --> 04:06.600
Then you found out he was shagging
that drip from Circulation.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.800
Which is when I stopped
shagging him.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.400
We shouldn't be talking
about this at the office party.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.000
But I always see you two together.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.899
He cheated on you,
but you stayed friends?

04:17.399 --> 04:22.100
I was head over heels, you know?
Everyone knew.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.100
-Does it look like l'm crying right now?
-No, no, no.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.300
No, it just looks like it's the smoke
from my cigarette.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.000
Did he ever actually tell you
that he loved you back?

04:32.200 --> 04:36.500
Yes. Three, almost four times.
And when I reminded him of that...

04:36.700 --> 04:39.000
...he said it must have been an answer
to a question.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.600
Which, by the way,
it absolutely was not.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.900
You know, lris, when you catch
your guy with another woman...

04:47.100 --> 04:49.200
...you're not supposed
to stay friends with him.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.500
You're supposed to never
talk to the prick again.

04:51.700 --> 04:55.000
You're supposed to throw things
at him, scream, call him names.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.700
Not do his blooming laundry.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.400
I don't do his laundry.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.400
Did someone tell you
I do his laundry?

05:02.400 --> 05:03.800
No, no, all we do now is...

05:04.300 --> 05:06.500
...we e-mail.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.400
Not when he's with her, of course.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.200
Also when he's not with her,
we talk on the phone.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.800
Sometimes for hours. And then
there's the occasional long lunch.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.800
You know, I never realized
how pathetic you are.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.500
Really?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.900
Oh, God. I'm so aware of it.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.500
They always know just
how to get us, don't they?

05:27.900 --> 05:29.900
He knows whenever he wants
back in your life...

05:30.100 --> 05:33.100
Actually, he has made some small
comments like that recently.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.300
He hasn't exactly come
right out and said it...

05:35.500 --> 05:37.400
Iris, did you file your story?

05:37.600 --> 05:42.000
Oh, no, not yet.
Down to the wire. Sorry.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.000
Better go.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.800
...groom's best friend spoke...

05:50.000 --> 05:54.600
...for many guests
when he said, "Hilary...

05:56.000 --> 05:58.700
...will open Edward's eyes...

05:58.900 --> 06:02.300
...and round out his life."

06:02.500 --> 06:05.100
Okay, l've got a question for you.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.400
What's it like to be the only one
committed to work...

06:11.600 --> 06:13.200
...while the rest of us
are slumming?

06:13.400 --> 06:15.300
You mean what's it like
to be the only one...

06:15.500 --> 06:17.300
...not to finish their work on time?

06:17.500 --> 06:20.200
Hold on. Don't... Don't go.

06:20.700 --> 06:23.200
Is it fun having a brain
that works that fast?

06:23.400 --> 06:25.300
-Shut up.
-No, I mean it.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
Probably a brilliant finish too.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.700
I assure you it's not.

06:31.900 --> 06:35.000
-Hi, Simpkey.
-Hi.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.100
Your column today was fantastic.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.800
God, I loved that line:

06:43.300 --> 06:48.100
"The onrushing stripping of dignity
and thought from British lives."

06:48.800 --> 06:50.200
Great writing.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.000
Hey, I got you something
for Christmas.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.700
That's convenient
because I got you something too.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.400
Darling, I don't actually
have my gift with me.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.700
In fact, I probably mislaid it,
but I know I got you something.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.600
I suspect it's somewhere in my car,
want to know what it is?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.300
No. No, no, that's okay.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
I know you're gonna look hot in it.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.500
Well, let's hope you find it, then.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.600
Not exactly something hot...

07:20.800 --> 07:23.600
...but happy Christmas.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.900
Thank you.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.500
I didn't think we'd get a chance
to do this this year.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.000
Remember last Christmas,
we exchanged gifts in March.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.000
This is good.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.900
We're getting better.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.700
You stinker.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.500
It's a first edition.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.200
Where did you find it?

07:49.400 --> 07:53.600
Buried in that little place we found
in Covent Garden that time.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.200
Why are you so great?

08:00.200 --> 08:02.800
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.400
Just a couple of minutes.
Thank you.

08:06.900 --> 08:09.300
I hate it that we can never talk.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.700
Hate it.

08:12.900 --> 08:16.600
Well, first of all, a very
happy Christmas to every one of you.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.000
Happy Christmas.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.900
Now, we're not officially closed,
as you very well know.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.100
But we are going to try
and get by this week...

08:24.300 --> 08:27.000
...with a smaller-than-normal staff.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Now, before some of you
rush off on holiday...

08:31.200 --> 08:34.900
...I do have one
rather important announcement.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.799
Now, this affects lris.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.299
-lris Simpkins, where are you?
-Here, sir.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.200
-lris, I have a tip for you.
-Excellent.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.600
A wedding was privately
announced earlier today...

08:46.800 --> 08:50.200
...that I don't believe any other paper
in town knows about.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.900
And I want you to be the first to report
on this particular union...

08:55.100 --> 09:00.100
...as it is between two of our
most esteemed colleagues.

09:00.300 --> 09:04.200
May I introduce the newly engaged
Sarah Smith-Alcott...

09:04.400 --> 09:08.000
...and Jasper Bloom!

09:08.700 --> 09:10.800
Come on.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.500
If I had known this was going
to happen, l'd have worn my good suit.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.200
Amanda!

11:31.300 --> 11:33.000
Amanda.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.700
Look, may I just say again...

11:39.000 --> 11:41.300
...that I did not sleep with her?

11:41.500 --> 11:45.100
Right, because your receptionist
needs to work till 3 in the morning.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.400
A bunch of us were working all night.
She wanted to hang out.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.000
Okay. Then swear on my life
that you didn't sleep with her.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.800
Come on.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.100
Go ahead.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.500
Look, I don't wanna...
l'm not gonna...

11:57.700 --> 11:59.400
Your receptionist, Ethan?

11:59.700 --> 12:02.100
This is why I knew we were smart
never to get married.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.400
I told you never to get rid
of your house.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.000
Somewhere inside
I knew this about you.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.500
First of all, can you please
calm down?

12:09.700 --> 12:11.300
Because I did not
sleep with her.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.600
Secondly, we've had problems
for over a year.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.300
And I know you don't wanna deal
with that, but we have.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.500
Oh, I am well aware we've
had problems for the last year.

12:19.700 --> 12:22.500
If I work a little bit too much,
I never stop hearing about it.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.100
But if you work too much,
maestro...

12:25.300 --> 12:28.200
-...it's for the sake of your music.
-"lf" you work too much?

12:28.400 --> 12:30.200
Amanda, you cut
75 trailers this year.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.400
You put a cutting room in the house
and sleep with your BlackBerry.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.800
And l'm not gonna have
a conversation about sex...

12:36.000 --> 12:37.900
...because I can't remember
the last time we did it.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.600
Come on, nobody has time for sex.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.300
That's not entirely true.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.200
That's it!
You absolutely slept with her!

12:46.400 --> 12:48.100
Seriously, you have to get out.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.300
Oh, God.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.400
You know what I really think, Ethan?

12:51.600 --> 12:54.500
-I don't think you ever really loved me.
-Oh, please.

12:54.700 --> 12:59.200
You loved the idea of you and me, but
not so much me. Not me, not really.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.100
Look, I did the best I could.
Is anybody good enough for that job?

13:05.200 --> 13:08.100
I will send you your things.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.800
You know you do this, right?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I mean, you screw up
every relationship you've ever been in.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.700
It's what you do.

13:18.900 --> 13:22.000
You didn't really wanna be a couple!
You resist it in your own way!

13:22.300 --> 13:23.500
Shut up!

13:23.700 --> 13:25.800
And it's hard to detect
how you even do it...

13:26.000 --> 13:28.700
...because nobody's quite
as smart as you!

13:29.100 --> 13:31.100
So you're hard to catch at it.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.100
But it always surfaces
and this is what happens.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.600
-What happens?
-Things end.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.500
Just like you knew they would.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.900
Amanda, you know how I feel
about you. There's nobody like you.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.000
You just don't wanna be
what I need.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.600
-Well, not what I "need."
-What?

13:45.800 --> 13:47.800
I mean...
You know what I mean.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.300
You know, I would never cheat on you,
not under any conditions.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.100
Neither would l, okay?

13:53.300 --> 13:56.200
Look at me. I'm down here
sweating like a pig. And look at you.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.100
The only woman on Earth
who breaks up with her boyfriend...

13:59.300 --> 14:01.500
...and doesn't even shed a tear?

14:01.700 --> 14:03.700
I mean,
that's gotta mean something, right?

14:03.900 --> 14:07.000
Why does it bug you so much
that I can't cry?

14:09.400 --> 14:11.100
Esophageal spasm.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.400
Oh, God, it's a big one.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
-No, it's okay. I'll be all right.
-I know, I know. I'm thinking about me.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.700
Ethan. Look, it's over.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.600
You know, we might as well
be honest with each other.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.800
Just tell me.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.500
Did you sleep with her?

14:31.500 --> 14:32.900
Just say it.

14:33.100 --> 14:36.700
What's the difference at this point,
right? I mean, why torture me?

14:37.400 --> 14:40.100
Just put me out of my misery.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.100
-What are we doing here...?
-Okay.

14:48.400 --> 14:53.000
Yes, okay? I slept with her.
Are you happy?

14:53.200 --> 14:57.300
I've been sleeping with her.
She's in love with me. She's young.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.300
Look, this is not a proud moment
for me.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.400
I mean, you should just know that.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.800
Amanda!

15:14.400 --> 15:15.800
Did you say, am I happy?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.300
I didn't mean that. You get me nuts
sometimes, I say things I don't mean.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.300
In the world of love, Ethan...

15:21.500 --> 15:23.200
...not that l'm such a genius at it...

15:23.400 --> 15:26.400
...but in the world of love,
cheating is not acceptable.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.000
No matter what you think...

15:28.200 --> 15:32.000
I know you have a very high opinion
of yourself, but this isn't all me.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.800
-Okay.
-So when you're not in such a rage...

15:35.000 --> 15:37.400
-...I think you'll see that too.
-Yeah, maybe.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.200
Maybe when I stop having visions
of you two together...

15:41.400 --> 15:43.100
...I will see your side.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.000
You gotta be...

15:57.900 --> 15:59.700
Punched him in the face.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.600
-ls this a bad time?
-No, no, l'm just...

16:05.800 --> 16:08.000
-l'm just flipping out a little bit.
-Oh, okay.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.300
God. Okay... No. I'm okay.
God, why would this happen?

16:11.500 --> 16:13.600
No. You know what? I'm all right.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.100
Hi.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.400
What's up?

16:18.800 --> 16:19.900
Ben needs you.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.800
Rebecca Green was just your
average 20-year-old.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.200
Until the father she never knew left
her something she never expected.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.100
Don't scream.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.700
-Your father left you something.
-I never met my father.

16:31.900 --> 16:34.600
-Now you know he was interesting.
-Lindsay Lohan.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.900
James Franco.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.000
-Deception.
-You happen to have two guns?

16:41.200 --> 16:43.100
I didn't think one would be enough.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.500
Christmas Day.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.700
Amazing! It finally looks like a hit.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.700
And that is why they pay you
the big bucks.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.500
I think we should go back
to the original cut on the end.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.300
-lt's so much stronger.
-I agree.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.800
And make "Christmas Day"
twice as big...

16:57.000 --> 17:00.500
...but try it in a red. Like a happy red,
not like a Scorsese red.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.100
Happy red.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.300
Okay, so we're done.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.900
-Great.
-All right.

17:09.099 --> 17:12.599
Hey, you know, let's just take off
for a few weeks.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.200
-Yeah.
-What do you mean? I'm not kidding.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.200
You always say that
this is our busiest time.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.400
I need to get out of town.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.000
You know? I think I need
some peace and quiet...

17:23.200 --> 17:25.900
...or whatever it is people
go away for.

17:26.099 --> 17:27.900
You know what I really wanna do?

17:28.099 --> 17:30.400
I wanna eat carbs without
wanting to kill myself.

17:30.600 --> 17:35.900
I wanna read a book.
Not just a magazine. An actual book.

17:36.100 --> 17:40.200
For years, I read these reviews,
I buy the books, but I never read them.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.200
Did you read that article in
The New York Times last Sunday?

17:43.400 --> 17:46.400
Severe stress makes women
age prematurely...

17:46.700 --> 17:49.100
...because stress causes DNA
in our cells to shrink...

17:49.300 --> 17:51.000
...until they can no longer replicate.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.100
So when we're stressed,
we look haggard.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.400
-This is just women, not men.
-l'm sorry.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.700
They used to say that...

17:57.900 --> 18:01.100
...single women over 35 were
more likely to be killed by a terrorist...

18:01.300 --> 18:03.100
...than to get married.
That was horrible.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.200
But now our generation
is also not getting married.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.700
And bonus, real terrorists
actually became part of our lives.

18:09.900 --> 18:13.400
So the stress of it all shows up on our
faces, making us look haggard.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.800
While Ethan goes on
looking cute forever...

18:16.100 --> 18:18.700
...shtupping his
24-year-old receptionist!

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Oh, my God!

18:21.600 --> 18:22.800
See what I mean?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.500
I need a vacation.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.500
Okay, where do I wanna go?

18:28.700 --> 18:32.400
By myself at Christmas.

18:33.100 --> 18:36.000
By myself depressed at Christmas.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.900
All alone on vacation.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.400
Alone, alone.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.100
Totally alone.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.000
Please, just give me one.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.500
One tear.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.400
Okay. Moving on.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.200
"Worry-Free vacations."

19:21.400 --> 19:23.300
Good. Where's that?

19:24.100 --> 19:25.300
Bora Bora.

19:26.300 --> 19:29.000
"Kayak for one?" No, thank you.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.700
"vacation Rentals." I could do that.

19:32.900 --> 19:35.900
Hole up in a house somewhere.
Disappear for a few weeks.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.600
I like that idea.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.200
"Where do you wanna go
on your next vacation?"

19:40.400 --> 19:41.900
"Click here and pick a country."

19:42.800 --> 19:44.400
Where do they speak English?

19:46.500 --> 19:48.000
"Click on a town or city."

19:48.200 --> 19:50.000
Let's see. Cotswolds.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.900
"Barn converted to modern house
in the beautiful Cotswolds."

19:54.800 --> 19:57.300
Which looks exactly like the valley.

19:57.900 --> 20:00.200
Surrey. "Christmas in the country."

20:00.400 --> 20:04.400
"A fairy-tale English cottage
set in a tranquil country garden.

20:04.700 --> 20:09.300
Snuggle up by an old stone fireplace
and enjoy a cup of cocoa.

20:09.500 --> 20:13.500
An enchanting oasis of tranquility
in a quiet English hamlet...

20:13.700 --> 20:16.900
...just 40 minutes
from exciting London."

20:18.400 --> 20:19.800
Yeah.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.900
What am I doing?

21:13.400 --> 21:15.300
Low point.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.600
Low point.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.300
"l'm interested... Renting your house.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.100
I'm wondering if your house
is available this Christmas.

21:34.300 --> 21:39.000
Because if it is,
you could be a real lifesaver."

21:43.500 --> 21:44.900
"l know it's late to be asking...

21:45.100 --> 21:48.300
...but if you're at all interested,
please contact me."

21:54.800 --> 21:58.500
"l'm very interested, but the cottage
is only available for home exchange."

21:58.700 --> 22:00.000
"Home exchange"? What is that?

22:00.900 --> 22:03.300
"We switch houses, cars,
everything.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.700
I haven't done it before,
but friends have."

22:06.800 --> 22:08.800
Where are you?

22:10.600 --> 22:13.200
Please say somewhere far away.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.100
"L.A."

22:19.700 --> 22:22.400
Never been there.
Always wanted to go.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.800
I'm lris, by the way.

22:25.700 --> 22:27.700
I'm very normal.

22:28.500 --> 22:33.100
Neat freak. Healthy. Non-smoker.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.100
Single.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.600
Hate my horrible life.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.000
I'm Amanda.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.400
Loner, loser and complicated wreck.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.300
Hi.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.300
Hi.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.400
I must say...

22:54.100 --> 22:56.200
...your house looks idyllic.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.200
"Just what I need." Really?

22:59.900 --> 23:02.600
What does your place look like?

23:02.800 --> 23:06.500
My place is nice,
but it's a little bigger than yours.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.700
"Are there any men in your town?"

23:28.400 --> 23:30.000
Honestly?

23:56.100 --> 23:57.900
"Tomorrow's perfect."

24:03.700 --> 24:08.400
Okay. We are on for two weeks...

24:08.600 --> 24:10.000
...starting tomorrow.

24:22.900 --> 24:23.800
Hi.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.300
-Hi.
-How are you?

24:28.400 --> 24:31.700
-Fine.
-Honey, we're sitting there.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.300
Sorry.

24:39.300 --> 24:41.800
Oh, yes. There it is.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.900
-Well, hello, dear.
-Hello.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.600
Excuse me.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.200
There we go.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.700
-l'm so sorry.
-No, no, it's okay.

24:51.900 --> 24:53.600
-Did you step on her foot?
-lt's okay.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.300
Oh, dear. Clumsy me.

26:25.100 --> 26:29.200
Amanda Woods is proud to present
Her Life.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.400
-She had it all;
-Yes, that's it.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.600
The job. The house.

26:34.500 --> 26:35.600
The guy.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.200
This holiday season...

26:38.200 --> 26:41.700
...find out
what Amanda doesn't have.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.100
This is amazing, this is amazing!

27:22.600 --> 27:23.800
Oh, look at that.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.100
Madam?

27:57.300 --> 27:58.300
Madam?

28:00.800 --> 28:02.200
-Madam?
-Yeah.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.600
-We're here.
-Okay.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.400
This can't be it.

28:16.100 --> 28:17.900
No, it's just down that lane.

28:18.100 --> 28:21.700
But the thing is, l'll never be able
to turn this around at the other end.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.600
Think you can make it from here?

28:25.200 --> 28:26.700
No.

28:47.700 --> 28:51.400
Hey. You wouldn't happen to know
where Rosehill Cottage is?

28:51.600 --> 28:54.700
Go right at the bridge, and then
just keep going. Way down there.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.500
Okay.

29:21.500 --> 29:22.500
I'm here!

29:39.600 --> 29:41.800
Holy shit.

30:04.100 --> 30:07.300
Oh, my God!

30:50.200 --> 30:53.100
Okay, that'll be interesting.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.700
Get in the... Get in there. Okay.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.500
Cute dress.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Oh, suitcase.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.600
Okay.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.700
Now what?

31:24.400 --> 31:25.500
I can do this.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.400
I can drive
on the wrong side of the road...

31:28.600 --> 31:30.100
...and the wrong side of the car.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.400
Just stay focused.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.700
Oh, please do not hit me!

31:39.000 --> 31:40.500
Okay, I hate this.

31:45.300 --> 31:46.200
Oh, God.

31:46.700 --> 31:49.000
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.000
-Move out of the way!
-Watch it!

31:58.200 --> 32:00.300
Sorry. Stop!

32:01.100 --> 32:02.600
Oh, God.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.300
I need a drink.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.100
Someone's having a party tonight.

32:33.300 --> 32:34.900
Oh, yeah.

32:35.100 --> 32:37.300
-They went to the shops.
-Didn't see anything.

32:39.100 --> 32:42.100
Came home,
and had a bit of a kiss and cuddle.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.200
The end.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.400
Rebecca Green
was just your average 20-year-old.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.300
Until the father she never knew...

32:48.500 --> 32:50.500
...Ieft her something
she never expected.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.700
- You happen to have two guns?
-I didn't think one would be enough.

32:53.900 --> 32:56.000
Deception. Christmas Day.

32:56.500 --> 33:00.700
And that's why they pay me
the big bucks.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.700
And now the weather. First,
Nort.hern England and Nort.h Wales...

33:03.900 --> 33:07.000
...will have sleet or snow in the
morning and again later in the day.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.199
Blinked.

35:38.100 --> 35:39.500
Oh, that's intense.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.100
Oh, no. "Gate"?

35:54.400 --> 35:56.500
-Who was he with?
-Maggie.

35:56.700 --> 35:59.000
-The flutes. This is the best part.
-One second.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.300
Hello... Hello?

36:03.400 --> 36:06.000
-Hello? Can you hear me?
-Yeah, it's Miles. Amanda?

36:06.200 --> 36:08.700
No, l'm sorry.
Amanda's not here, l'm afraid.

36:08.900 --> 36:12.600
I'm trying to figure out
how to open the gate. Oh, fu...

36:13.800 --> 36:14.800
very nice.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.900
If you heard that, I'm sorry.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.400
-Hi.
-Hi.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.800
I'm so sorry.
I'm new at the gate thing.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.500
It's okay. It was pretty funny.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.000
I'm Miles. I work with Ethan.

36:32.900 --> 36:33.800
Ethan?

36:34.400 --> 36:36.500
-Amanda's ex.
-Oh, right.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.200
Right.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.700
Know when she'll be back?
Supposed to pick up things.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.900
Amanda's in England,
actually, on holiday.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.600
I'm staying here while she's away.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.200
-You okay?
-Yes.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.300
Yeah, something just
blew into my eye.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.700
Oh, I hate that. Let me see.

36:53.900 --> 36:57.200
Yep, you got something in
your eyelash. You want me to get it?

36:58.700 --> 37:00.700
-Okay.
-Okay.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.200
-Yeah, Santa Anas.
-Pardon?

37:03.400 --> 37:05.800
The wind. It's what makes
it so warm this time of year.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.900
Legend has it,
when the Santa Anas blow...

37:09.100 --> 37:11.100
...all bets are off.
Anything can happen.

37:11.800 --> 37:14.800
That's it. You okay?

37:16.100 --> 37:18.600
Better. Thank you.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.100
So you needed to...?

37:25.300 --> 37:26.900
Pick up Ethan's laptop.

37:27.900 --> 37:29.400
And you're his...?

37:29.600 --> 37:32.000
Oh, well, l'm a film composer, too,
like Ethan, but...

37:32.200 --> 37:34.900
-Did you compose this? It's beautiful.
-This?

37:35.100 --> 37:36.700
Yes, I did. I wrote this.

37:36.900 --> 37:39.200
No, I didn't. I wish I did.

37:39.400 --> 37:42.500
This is the great Ennio Morricone.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.500
Would you mind
coming back tomorrow?

37:44.700 --> 37:46.900
I just want to check this
with Amanda's assistant.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.100
Sure.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.200
-l'm lris, by the way.
-Miles.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.900
-Right.
-And this is my Maggie.

37:53.100 --> 37:57.100
I mean, just Maggie.
Not "my" Maggie.

37:57.300 --> 37:59.100
-Hello.
-Hey.

37:59.300 --> 38:00.800
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.600
Okay.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.000
Don't blow away.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.100
I won't.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.400
Anything can happen.

38:50.600 --> 38:56.400
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12. One a.m. in London.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.600
Who is it?

39:41.800 --> 39:44.000
It's me. Hurry up. It's freezing.

39:44.900 --> 39:47.000
-Who are you?
-lris, open the door...

39:47.200 --> 39:49.700
...or I swear l'm gonna take a leak
all over your...

39:53.900 --> 39:55.600
You're not lris.

39:56.300 --> 39:59.000
Or if you are,
l'm much drunker than I realized.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.000
I'm sorry for my profanity.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.900
I wasn't expecting you.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.700
Well, I wasn't expecting you either.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.200
Nevertheless, may I just...?

40:11.900 --> 40:15.000
Yeah. Of course. Sure.
You had to... Yeah.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.200
I'm Graham. Iris' brother.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.500
Brother.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.600
I'm Amanda Woods.
I'm staying here.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.700
Amandawoods?
Is that all one word?

40:25.800 --> 40:27.800
No. No, it's not.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.500
Brother? Oh, my God.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.100
So lris is... Where is...?
Where is she?

40:37.300 --> 40:38.600
She didn't tell you?

40:38.800 --> 40:42.000
She could have done...

40:43.500 --> 40:45.900
...but as previously stated...

40:46.100 --> 40:49.600
...I'm... l've just... l've been...

40:49.800 --> 40:52.100
She's in Los Angeles.

40:52.300 --> 40:55.600
That's not possible.
Iris never goes anywhere.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.900
Well, we have that in common.

40:58.100 --> 41:01.900
No, she listed this cottage on a
home-exchange website and I found it.

41:02.100 --> 41:05.100
We switched houses for two weeks.
For the holiday.

41:05.400 --> 41:09.100
She's in L.A. at my house
and l'm here.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.800
-People actually do that?
-Apparently.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.500
Yeah. I mean, it seems.
Here I am in my pajamas.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.200
She did ring me last night. I didn't
get a chance to get back to her.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.300
I feel awful now.

41:23.700 --> 41:26.300
Would you mind if I sat?
I feel like I might bump into you.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.800
Sure. Yeah. Sit.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.700
You okay?

41:35.900 --> 41:38.100
Yeah, l'm good.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.100
Look, l'm sorry about the intrusion.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.900
Although I may not appear it,
I am in fact lris'...

41:45.100 --> 41:47.400
...semi-respectable big brother.

41:48.300 --> 41:51.200
But on the rare...
Or lately not-so-rare occasion...

41:51.400 --> 41:53.800
...that I frequent the local pub...

41:54.000 --> 41:57.400
...and get inordinately pissed,
my little sister puts me up...

41:57.800 --> 41:59.400
...so I don't get behind the wheel.

41:59.600 --> 42:04.600
Pathetic explanation, but unfortunately
it's become a bit of a routine.

42:06.300 --> 42:08.200
So how's it going so far?

42:08.400 --> 42:11.000
I mean, up until I showed up
and ruined your night.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.600
Well, it's not going so great.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.800
Yeah, l'm leaving tomorrow
on a noon plane.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.500
When did you get here?

42:21.600 --> 42:23.100
About six hours ago.

42:23.300 --> 42:25.900
We've made a great impression
on you, haven't we?

42:26.100 --> 42:27.800
No, it's not that. It's just that...

42:28.000 --> 42:30.200
You know,
l'm not quite myself right now.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.100
I came here on a stupid whim.

42:32.300 --> 42:35.600
Honestly, l've never thought about
anything less. It's very unlike me.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.600
Would you like something to drink?

42:38.800 --> 42:41.600
Glass of water? Tea?

42:41.800 --> 42:42.800
Wine, maybe?

42:43.700 --> 42:47.700
I think there's a bottle of brandy.
Fancy a glass?

42:49.300 --> 42:51.000
-Sure.
-Good.

42:52.600 --> 42:56.700
So... I'm sorry, l've totally blanked
and forgotten your name.

42:56.900 --> 42:58.300
Amanda.

42:58.500 --> 42:59.900
So, Amanda...

43:00.100 --> 43:01.500
...you're not married, are you?

43:02.400 --> 43:04.200
Why? Do I look not married?

43:04.400 --> 43:08.700
No. It was just a backwards way
of asking if you were married.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.800
No, not at all.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.600
I don't know what that means.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.400
I mean, no, l'm not married.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.000
Me neither.

43:24.100 --> 43:26.600
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

43:35.200 --> 43:36.700
So is it horrible if I stay?

43:36.900 --> 43:38.800
I'll be gone
before you even wake up.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.300
I promise you will never
lay eyes on me again.

43:43.900 --> 43:46.400
Of... No, that's fine. Sure.

43:46.600 --> 43:48.900
-Thank you.
-Let me just get you a blanket.

43:49.100 --> 43:51.400
In the cupboard,
on top of the Scrabble.

43:53.600 --> 43:59.000
So why is it you aren't
quite yourself at the moment?

43:59.300 --> 44:03.700
Well, I just broke up with someone.

44:03.900 --> 44:05.300
Yesterday.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.100
And I guess
what I was feeling...

44:07.300 --> 44:09.700
...was that I didn't wanna be alone
over the holidays.

44:09.900 --> 44:11.600
I thought that
if I was somewhere else...

44:11.800 --> 44:13.300
...I wouldn't realize I was alone.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.800
Then I got here
and never felt more alone in my life.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.800
Big surprise.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.800
Bet you're glad you knocked
on this door.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.100
I am, actually.

44:24.900 --> 44:26.800
Yeah, well...

44:27.800 --> 44:31.400
Sorry and good night.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.300
Sweet dreams.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.800
Do you think you could...?

44:42.700 --> 44:44.400
Would you mind...

44:45.300 --> 44:46.500
...trying that again?

44:59.500 --> 45:01.000
Bad?

45:03.400 --> 45:04.500
Weird.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.200
Kissing a total stranger.

45:09.400 --> 45:12.200
Really? I do it all the time.

45:14.700 --> 45:16.500
Let me try this.

45:27.300 --> 45:29.400
Maybe if I closed my eyes.

45:47.400 --> 45:51.000
You know, given that
l'm in a bit of a personal crisis...

45:51.200 --> 45:54.900
...and I find myself
in a total stranger's home...

45:55.100 --> 45:57.700
...in a town that I can't
actually remember the name of...

45:57.900 --> 46:00.300
...and considering
that you showed up...

46:00.500 --> 46:03.500
...and you're, like,
insanely good-looking...

46:03.800 --> 46:07.000
...and really drunk and probably
won't remember me anyway...

46:07.300 --> 46:10.700
...I'm thinking...

46:10.900 --> 46:12.900
...we should have sex.

46:13.700 --> 46:15.100
If you want.

46:16.700 --> 46:18.300
Is that a trick question?

46:19.300 --> 46:21.800
I'm actually serious.

46:22.300 --> 46:26.100
And not that it matters, but l've never
said anything like that in my entire life.

46:26.700 --> 46:27.900
It's just that this whole...

46:28.100 --> 46:31.900
...knowing-l'll-never-see-you-again
thing is kind of exciting.

46:32.100 --> 46:34.200
I mean, this is what a vacation's
supposed to be.

46:34.400 --> 46:37.400
You're supposed to vacate life,
do the unexpected. And you are...

46:38.200 --> 46:40.600
...definitely unexpected.

46:40.900 --> 46:43.400
This all sounded wonderful
till I became the cabana boy.

46:44.300 --> 46:46.400
And you're funny,
which is, like, a bonus.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.300
Yeah? Never meet me
when l'm sober.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.300
Deal.

46:55.700 --> 46:57.600
Oh, also, I should warn you.

46:58.300 --> 47:00.800
I'm not very good at this.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.600
"This" being...?

47:03.200 --> 47:06.400
-Sex.
-Okay. Now, that cannot be true.

47:06.600 --> 47:09.900
Nevertheless, the guy that I lived with
mentioned it once or twice...

47:10.100 --> 47:13.800
...and a girl does not forget
a comment like that. Not even me.

47:24.300 --> 47:26.100
I mean, how bad could I be?

47:26.300 --> 47:30.600
Sex is pretty basic, right? Am l
pretty much talking you out of this?

47:30.800 --> 47:32.600
Strangely, not at all.

47:32.800 --> 47:34.900
How do you feel about foreplay?

47:35.600 --> 47:37.500
I think it's overrated.

47:37.700 --> 47:40.900
Significantly overrated.

47:41.300 --> 47:46.200
You are quickly becoming one of
the most interesting girls l've ever met.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.100
Look at you.

47:58.300 --> 48:01.300
You're already better than you think.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.500
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

48:18.800 --> 48:22.700
I lost my contacts
last night somehow.

48:26.400 --> 48:28.400
-Much better.
-Yeah.

48:29.300 --> 48:30.400
Can I help you with that?

48:30.800 --> 48:33.200
I should know how to do this.

48:37.300 --> 48:41.100
You're supposed to
plug them in over here. Right.

48:49.200 --> 48:52.200
-So, Amanda, I just really...
-Yeah. You know...

48:52.400 --> 48:55.800
...Iisten, you don't have to worry
about a thing here. Okay?

48:57.800 --> 48:58.700
Okay.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.900
I mean, it was great
meeting you and everything.

49:04.000 --> 49:09.100
Definitely. Also, for the record,
your ex-boyfriend is, in my opinion...

49:09.300 --> 49:11.800
...extremely mistaken about you.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.600
Well, yeah, you were drunk.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.600
-Not that drunk.
-Yeah.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.100
Oh, that's mine.

49:19.600 --> 49:22.400
Sophie. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to look.

49:23.300 --> 49:24.800
I'll call her back.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Coffee cups.

49:34.100 --> 49:37.100
-Here.
-Thank you.

49:38.300 --> 49:39.300
You don't want one?

49:39.900 --> 49:42.200
I should probably be going.

49:44.700 --> 49:48.600
Oh, yeah. You know, I gotta get going
in a few minutes myself.

49:48.800 --> 49:51.400
So listen.

49:51.600 --> 49:54.200
I know you're leaving
and absolutely not interested...

49:54.400 --> 49:57.300
...in getting involved,
but just so you know...

49:57.500 --> 50:00.600
...things in my life
are a little bit complicated...

50:00.800 --> 50:03.100
...and even if you were staying,
I can promise you...

50:03.300 --> 50:05.900
-...you wouldn't...
-You really don't have to do this.

50:06.100 --> 50:09.600
Look, l'm sort of a mess
in this area myself.

50:09.800 --> 50:13.700
And anyway, I mean,
honestly, we hardly know each other.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.200
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that...

50:16.400 --> 50:20.600
...but I just want to assure you,
you're better off. I'm...

50:21.400 --> 50:22.300
-l'm...
-Okay.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.700
No need to go on. Right.

50:26.900 --> 50:30.900
Well, I just want to be sure
you are okay because somehow...

50:31.100 --> 50:36.100
...I find I tend to hurt women
simply by being myself, so...

50:36.300 --> 50:39.300
I'm not going
to fall in love with you, I promise.

50:40.100 --> 50:42.500
Okay. Nicely put. Thank you.

50:42.700 --> 50:47.100
No, it's just that I know myself.
I'm not sure I even fall in love.

50:47.300 --> 50:49.400
Not like the way other people do.

50:50.300 --> 50:51.900
How's that for something to admit?

50:53.500 --> 50:56.200
Well, like I said,
Most lnteresting Girl Award.

50:57.600 --> 51:00.400
I'm gonna try to see that
as a compliment.

51:00.600 --> 51:03.700
You should. Absolutely.

51:07.400 --> 51:08.800
Right.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.000
Okay, then. Well...

51:13.200 --> 51:16.300
Utter honesty. very refreshing.

51:16.900 --> 51:20.000
Well, you probably
won't be hearing from me...

51:20.200 --> 51:22.800
...because even if you wanted to,
and you clearly don't...

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
...I have the classic
male problem of no follow-through.

51:26.200 --> 51:29.200
Absolutely never remember
to call after a date.

51:32.500 --> 51:35.900
But since this wasn't a date
I guess l'm off the hook.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.200
Exactly.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.700
But what if I wanted to call you?

51:46.900 --> 51:50.100
Right. Sorry. Apparently not
the right thing to say at all.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.900
Well, if your flight's canceled
or for some reason...

51:54.100 --> 51:57.100
...you change your mind, l'm having
dinner with some friends...

51:57.300 --> 51:58.400
...at the pub tonight.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.400
And...

52:03.600 --> 52:08.100
...if not, then, well...

52:10.000 --> 52:11.500
...you're lovely.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.200
So are you.

52:27.900 --> 52:32.200
Attention passengers,
this is the final boarding call...

52:32.400 --> 52:35.500
...for British Airways flight 42.

52:42.500 --> 52:44.300
Amanda wasn't looking for love...

52:45.700 --> 52:49.300
...but that doesn't mean
it didn't find her.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.000
Well, ma'am, you're good to go.

52:52.700 --> 52:53.900
Thank you.

53:20.300 --> 53:23.600
Thank you, Amanda.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.400
Hello?

53:46.600 --> 53:47.700
Where am I finding you?

53:50.600 --> 53:51.700
Jasper.

53:51.900 --> 53:54.300
Is it okay that I'm calling you?

53:56.700 --> 53:58.600
I suppose so.

53:59.100 --> 54:00.100
How are you?

54:00.300 --> 54:02.800
Could we start.
with a less complicated question?

54:04.600 --> 54:05.800
What's wrong?

54:06.000 --> 54:10.300
I'm having some real problems
with a section of my book.

54:10.500 --> 54:12.700
I can use some Iris.

54:14.100 --> 54:15.900
Would it be awful
if I sent you some pages?

54:16.100 --> 54:18.800
Just tell me if it is.
I don't wanna mess you up. I'll...

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
I know that you're the only one
who can really help me.

54:23.100 --> 54:25.300
No. Well... I mean...

54:27.300 --> 54:28.700
...if you need me.

54:28.900 --> 54:31.500
Well, you know
you are my little survival kit.

54:33.000 --> 54:37.600
So, Simpkey, have you put on
that little red bikini yet?

54:37.800 --> 54:40.600
You know,
the one that unties at the back?

54:40.800 --> 54:43.300
How do you remember
my little red bikini?

54:43.500 --> 54:46.500
I remember everything.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.400
Do you?

54:49.800 --> 54:52.800
You know, just the other day,
I was just thinking about that time...

54:53.000 --> 54:55.100
Darling, I've just arrived
at Soho House.

54:55.300 --> 54:57.300
I'm meeting some friends for drinks.

54:57.500 --> 55:00.000
-Okay.
-You keep the change.

55:00.600 --> 55:01.800
Bloody cold in here.

55:02.100 --> 55:03.800
Okay, I'm sending you
the pages tomorrow.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
Look for them, will you?
And have some fun today, okay?

55:09.200 --> 55:10.800
Okay.

55:29.300 --> 55:30.700
Graham?

56:02.100 --> 56:04.000
Oh, no, is he lost?

56:17.900 --> 56:19.200
Excuse me.

56:20.400 --> 56:23.900
Hello. Can I offer you a lift home?

56:24.500 --> 56:26.800
Why? You know where I live?

56:27.800 --> 56:29.000
I believe I do, yes.

56:29.200 --> 56:31.900
Good. Then that makes one of us.

56:35.300 --> 56:37.000
Your house is lovely.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.400
I've lived here 47 years.

56:39.700 --> 56:42.700
Back then, there were only
six houses on this block.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.200
Every year,
they tear another one down...

56:45.400 --> 56:46.900
...not that I blame them.

56:47.100 --> 56:49.500
They weren't that great
to begin with.

56:51.700 --> 56:56.000
But that's how I got confused.
I didn't recognize one house.

56:57.300 --> 56:59.100
That would be confusing.

57:00.700 --> 57:02.700
What part of England are you from?

57:04.800 --> 57:08.500
-Surrey.
-Cary Grant was from Surrey.

57:08.700 --> 57:10.900
That's right, he was.

57:11.400 --> 57:14.500
-How did you know that?
-Oh, he told me once.

57:14.700 --> 57:17.700
Well, I thank you very much,
young lady.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.400
Let me help you with that.

57:24.300 --> 57:25.700
Okay.

57:25.900 --> 57:27.400
I... Thank you.

57:28.900 --> 57:30.100
There you go.

57:30.300 --> 57:32.700
Well, this was some meet-cute.

57:33.200 --> 57:35.800
-Sorry?
-lt's how two characters meet...

57:36.000 --> 57:37.300
...in a movie.

57:38.100 --> 57:40.800
Say a man and a woman...

57:41.000 --> 57:43.400
...both need something to sleep in.

57:44.200 --> 57:47.700
And they both go
to the same men's pajama department.

57:47.900 --> 57:50.900
-Right.
-And the man says to the salesman:

57:51.100 --> 57:54.600
"l just need bottoms."
The woman says, "l just need a top."

57:55.300 --> 57:59.100
They look at each other,
and that's the "meet-cute."

57:59.700 --> 58:01.200
Oh, I see.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.200
Of course, this isn't
quite that cute, but...

58:05.900 --> 58:08.700
So you're in the film business?

58:08.900 --> 58:12.500
Was. Yes, yes, I was.

58:13.200 --> 58:15.200
I was a writer.

58:22.600 --> 58:24.300
I could be here till tomorrow.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.200
Oh, here.

58:26.700 --> 58:28.300
Let me.

58:34.600 --> 58:36.300
Thank you.

59:07.500 --> 59:09.500
Oh, my God.

59:26.100 --> 59:28.100
Well, goodbye, then.

59:29.300 --> 59:31.800
I enjoyed our meet-cute.

59:32.100 --> 59:34.100
Well, thank you.
Thank you for rescuing me.

59:34.600 --> 59:38.000
It's a pleasure. Absolutely.

59:44.700 --> 59:47.900
You know, I hope you
don't find this strange...

59:48.100 --> 59:51.500
...but l've just arrived here,
and, well, I don't really know anyone.

59:51.700 --> 59:54.600
And I was thinking of going out
for dinner tonight.

59:54.800 --> 59:57.500
Well, if you're not busy,
would you like to join me?

59:58.300 --> 01:00:03.400
Busy? Honey,
I haven't been busy since 1978.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.500
I learned everything
working in this place.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.900
-Best job I ever had.
-Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.300
That was your first job
in Hollywood?

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.500
Louis B. Mayer's office boy?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.300
Actually, my first job
was as a Western Union messenger.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.800
That's how I met Mayer. I delivered
a telegram to his office at MGM.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.600
When I walked in, all the girls
in the office were in a tizzy.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.800
Their office boy didn't show up.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.100
I volunteered for the job.
The next day, I was on the payroll.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.900
I was 17 years old.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:46.000
So was Hollywood really as great
back then as I imagine?

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.400
It was better.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.400
You know what l've been
asking myself all night?

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.000
What? Why l'm bothering you
with all these questions?

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.000
I'm wondering
why a beautiful girl like you...

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.100
...would go to a stranger's house
for her Christmas vacation...

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.900
...and on top of that, spend Saturday
night with an old cocker like me.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.900
Well, I...

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.800
I just wanted to get away
from the people I see all the time.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.800
Well, not all the people.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.500
One person.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.800
I wanted to get away from one guy.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:36.200
An ex-boyfriend who just got engaged
and forgot to tell me.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.700
-Sorry.
-So he's a schmuck.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.500
As a matter of fact, he is.
A huge schmuck.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.500
-How did you know?
-He let you go.

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.500
This is not a hard one to figure out.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.100
Iris, in the movies
we have leading ladies...

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.900
...and we have the best friend.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.900
You, I can tell, are a leading lady.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.100
But for some reason,
you're behaving like the best friend.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.000
You're so right.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.300
You're supposed to be the leading
lady of your own life, for God's sake.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:14.300
Arthur, l've been going
to a therapist for three years.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:18.200
And she's never explained
anything to me that well.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.500
That was brilliant.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.600
Brutal, but brilliant.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.800
Thank you.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.300
I haven't had that much to drink in...

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.500
What am I saying?

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:47.000
-l've never had that much to drink.
-Yes, I believe no one ever has.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.500
Okay, the last thing I remember
was coming in here last night and...

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.500
-I had nothing to do with that.
-Oh, I know, but you were here.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.200
-I was.
-Oh, God. So I guess we...

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:06.230
Did we...? I mean, did we...?

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.500
-We didn't?
-We did not.

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.700
Oh, thank God.

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:18.400
I mean, not "thank God,"
but just thank God.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.400
Because I didn't remember...

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.600
So why didn't we...?
Just remind me a little.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.000
Call me old-fashioned...

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.400
...but one doesn't have sex
with women who are unconscious.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.000
Unconscious? Oh, God.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.400
That must have been
really attractive.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.400
Why did you stay?

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.400
Because you asked me to.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.300
I did, didn't l?

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.200
Did I beg at one point?

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:56.100
From the moment I met you,
it's been an adventure.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.500
Oh, yes.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:03.000
And I am deeply sorry about that.
I have nothing to say for myself...

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.600
...other than I must be
temporarily nuts right now.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.300
Olivia. Sorry, I didn't mean to look.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.600
-Again.
-I should probably take this.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.200
Hello. Hi.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.800
I can't. I can't today.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.700
Sophie, Olivia, Amanda.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.300
Busy guy.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
-I think we should go into town.
-What do you mean?

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.900
I think you should get dressed.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:07.200
We should take a drive, get some
lunch and get to know each other.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.000
Really? Why?

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.400
Because l'm running out of reasons
why we shouldn't.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.100
Aren't you?

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.700
-So you're a book editor.
-Yes, I am.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:52.000
-What kind of an editor are you?
-A very mean one.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.400
No. What I meant was,
do you give massive notes, or...?

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.200
The better the writer,
the less notes.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.400
-And what'd you study in school?
-Literature.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.000
And did you always know
this was what you wanted to do?

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.900
Okay, my palms
are starting to sweat.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.900
I feel like l'm on a job interview.

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.600
Do you, by any chance,
know how to be on a date?

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.300
-Sorry. I'm interrogating you.
-Yes.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:17.300
I haven't been on a first date
in a long time.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:21.500
Well, since we've already had sex
and slept together twice...

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.000
...maybe we can bend
the first-date rules.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.800
Why are you blushing?

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.200
I didn't realize I was.
I think you make me nervous.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:35.100
Okay. I'm gonna try to be myself.
It's never easy, but l'm gonna try.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.500
What was the question? Oh, I know.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.200
-Did I always want to be a book editor?
-Did you...? Right.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.500
The answer is yes.
My family's in publishing.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.500
My dad's a writer
of historical fiction.

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.100
My mum was...

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.700
Is, to this day, a very important editor
at Random House.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:54.600
Okay. I believe my time is up.
Your turn.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.400
Really?

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.000
-Deep breath.
-Okay.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.200
-All right?
-Yeah.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.300
Well, like I said the other night...

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.900
...I own a company
that does movie advertising.

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.900
I didn't realize
you own the company.

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.700
Probably because
I didn't mention it.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.000
But now that I know you were raised
by such a strong working mom...

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.600
...I can say it,
and maybe you won't be intimidated.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.900
No, no.
I'm still a little intimidated by it.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.400
Well, "a little"
is way ahead of the curve.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.800
-Yeah.
-What about your family?

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.900
Okay, l'll say it fast.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.200
My parents broke up when I was 15.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.900
I'm an only child, and I...
I didn't see it coming.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.500
You know, we were really close.

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.000
We used to call ourselves
"The Three Musketeers."

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:44.800
And one night after dinner,
my parents sat me down...

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.600
...and told me that
they were breaking up.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.100
I thought they were kidding.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.600
And then I saw a suitcase out of
the corner of my eye in the hallway.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.600
And my dad moved out that night.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.100
I think I cried myself to sleep
for, like, well...

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.900
Anyway, a long time.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.300
And then I realized
that l'd better toughen up.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:16.700
And, well, I got through it
and sort of haven't cried since.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.800
I also haven't thought of
that packed suitcase maybe ever.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.000
And that's my tragic little story.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.500
-Let's order.
-Wait.

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.300
You haven't cried
since you were 15?

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:32.399
I know it must mean something awful.
I know, but...

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.899
You know, I try, but... Believe me.

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:39.100
But can we talk about you
some more, please?

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:43.100
Okay. Yes. Absolutely. Okay.
Well, I cry all the time.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:45.399
-You do not.
-Yeah, I do.

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.399
More than any woman
you've ever met.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.500
You don't have to be this nice.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.899
-lt happens to be the truth.
-Really?

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.399
A good book, a great film,
a birthday card, I weep.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.899
-Shut up.
-l'm a major weeper.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.300
I am.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.700
-This was such a great afternoon.
-lt was a really great afternoon.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.700
You know, you don't have
to walk me in. It's freezing, and...

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.400
You can just say
you don't want me to come in.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.200
No, it's not that. I just... No...

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.600
I'm just tired.
I think l'm gonna take a nap.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.200
-lt's not that.
-Okay, l'll pretend I believe you.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.800
Graham, l'm leaving in nine days.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.600
And that makes this complicated.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.900
And l'm not sure I can handle
complicated right now.

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:31.200
Okay.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.500
And that doesn't make things
complicated?

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.400
Sex makes everything complicated.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.600
Even when you don't have it, the not
having it makes things complicated.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.500
Which is why it's usually better
to have it. Some say.

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:04.200
Well, l'm off to work in the morning.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.700
I promise I won't be drunkenly
banging on your door any time soon.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.700
We'll see each other, okay?
We'll figure something out.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.200
-Good.
-Good.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.500
Oh, it's freezing.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.200
-Hi.
-Hello.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.900
-Bad timing?
-No, no. Come in.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.300
-How's it going?
-Good. Yeah, everything's good.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.000
This FedEx was leaning
on the gate.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.900
From a little town
called London, England.

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:04.600
Friend of mine's writing a book,
and I give him...

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
...notes sometimes.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:15.200
-You have company?
-l'm having a little Hanukkah party.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.100
Did you join a temple
since I last saw you?

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.600
No. My neighbor knew
I didn't know anyone here.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.200
So he wanted to introduce me
to some of his friends.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.900
And somehow it turned into
a Hanukkah thing.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.000
Do you wanna come in for a sec?

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.900
All right. Yeah.
I could play spin the dreidel.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.600
Smells good.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.100
I just have to say, this is one of
the best Hanukkahs l've ever had.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.600
Hear, hear.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.300
I've had too much of the Manischewitz.
I'm gonna have to be cut off.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.100
We are cutting you off.

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:49.100
I take this very seriously,
and l'm telling you the truth.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.300
He amazes me.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.200
Don't listen to them. They're nuts.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:57.200
Okay, so you're telling me
you were not a ladies' man?

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.900
Never. I married very young.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.300
Yes, only because
he had the greatest girl in town.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.400
He had to take her off the market.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.100
-That's the truth.
-Everyone loved Marion.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.900
She had the greatest laugh.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.000
What did he say?
She had the greatest ass?

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.800
Greatest laugh.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.100
Although her ass
wasn't so bad, either.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:24.300
She had real gumption.
She was the girl I always wrote.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.700
What about you, Miles?
You're a man about town, I presume.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:34.500
No, gents, sadly I am not. I'm just
a one-woman-at-a-time kind of guy.

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:40.300
Actually, l've been dating a beautiful
actress for about five months.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:44.300
I do not know what she sees in me,
but l'm the luckiest guy in the world.

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:47.300
Oh, she's an actress?
What's she been in?

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.500
-Anything we would have seen?
-She hasn't done that much yet, but...

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.200
And where is she tonight?

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.300
Look, he's half-dead,
and he's still interested.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:00.200
Well, I mean, that made me curious.
You know, he's here. Where is she?

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:05.100
She's on location in New Mexico.
She's working on a little indie film.

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:09.100
Sorry she couldn't be here.
She'll be back in about 10 days.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.000
Her loss is our gain.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.500
-Thank you, Arthur.
-Fellas...

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.700
...I think we should leave these young
folks and get back to our bedpans.

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.400
Okay, Norman,
you are calling me for pinochle.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.700
-I got your cell, l'll be in touch.
-Okay, pound right here.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.500
This was an amazing night.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.500
Arthur Abbott is maybe the last
of the great Hollywood writers...

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.100
...from that generation. Thanks.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.300
There are, like, famous things we say
because he wrote them.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.600
I know. He told me
that his friends wrote Casablanca...

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.600
...but that he added the "kid"
to "Here's looking at you, kid."

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.400
Hello! Which totally makes the line.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.400
"Here's looking at you, llsa."

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.400
Doesn't quite have that ring.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.000
He's so modest. He gave me this long
list of old movies he said I had to see.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.700
None were written by him,
of course.

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.600
I saw a couple today.
They were fantastic.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.400
Maybe we can see one together.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.600
-That would be great.
-All right, cool.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.500
Then l'll definitely call you.

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:18.400
The brisket was great. And those
chocolate-covered macaroons.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.900
Delectable. It was really fun
hanging with you.

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:25.300
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to kiss you twice...

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.700
...and then linger a long time
on the second kiss.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.300
-No problem.
-Oh, boy.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.200
It is officially crazy weather.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.000
Don't blow away.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.700
"l'm not sure
I can handle complicated"?

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:05.100
Oh, God, I can be such a jerk.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.500
-Amanda Woods.
-Shut up.

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:12.100
She pushed every guy away,
every time.

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:16.100
It's not, "Will she ever change" but,
"Does she want to?"

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.700
-Surprise.
-Yeah, it is. Hi.

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:01.400
Hi. So I was home doing nothing
and thinking of you...

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.600
...and I realized that a little
complication never hurt anyone.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.800
And then I thought,
maybe this isn't so complicated at all.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.700
And also, I wanted to apologize.

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.500
I am sorry I didn't
invite you in this afternoon.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.800
I don't know what that
was about exactly...

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.700
...but whatever it was,
I thought that I should just...

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.700
Oh, my God. You're,
you're not alone, are you?

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.600
No, l'm not, actually.

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:30.700
-l'm sorry.
-No. No, no, no. Don't be.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.500
I shouldn't have just...
Oh, man.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.700
Okay, seriously,
do not worry about this.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
This is just me, like, being stupid.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.600
Who is it, Daddy?

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.700
-"Daddy"?
-Yes.

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:50.200
I am Daddy.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.400
Amanda, this is my
daughter Sophie.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.100
Soph, this is my friend Amanda.

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.900
-Hi.
-How do you do?

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.200
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.000
very well, thank you.
Do you want to come in?

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.600
Oh, no, I just...

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.400
Hi.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.400
Come here.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.800
Daddy, who is this?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.100
This is Amanda. And, Amanda,
this is my youngest. Olivia.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.900
Sophie and Olivia.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.600
Dad.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.900
-Dad.
-Sorry, yes. Of course, come in.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.500
Come in.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.800
Okay.

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:50.200
Daddy, can we still have
hot chocolate, please?

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.300
-Yes.
-With baby marshmallows?

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.100
Yes.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.300
Dad, take her coat.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.900
-Yes. May l, may l...?
-Oh, sure. Thanks.

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:14.000
Are you married? Tell me fast.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.800
-No.
-Okay.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.700
I know. I'm a tad overdressed.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.900
You look like my Barbie.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.100
-Thanks.
-ls that for us?

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.100
Yes. Except for l'm sorry
about the wine.

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:45.000
I apologize for not
having mentioned this earlier.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.200
You're D-l-v-O-R-C-E-D?

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.900
W-l-D-O-W-E-R.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.200
Two years ago.

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:04.700
Amanda, are you by any chance
at all into hot chocolate?

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.800
As a matter of fact, l'm...

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:12.100
...totally into it.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:15.100
-Here we go, Olivia. Olivia...
-Thank you.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.500
...blow on it. It's hot.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.400
You too, Soph.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.300
She has more marshmallows
than me.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.400
No, she doesn't.
You each have five.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
-You have five too.
-Thank you.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.400
One, two, three, four, five.

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.800
What? Do I have something
on my lip?

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.200
Just look! There.

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.400
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.600
-Hello.
-Going up! Blow on mine.

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.600
Thank you.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.000
Excellent timing.

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:56.700
Dad, do Mr. Napkin Head.

01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.400
-No. No, no, no. No Mr. Napkin Head.
-Please? Do it!

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.100
-Do it. Do it. Please.
-Do it, please. Beg you, please?

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:06.000
Please? Okay, l'll do it quickly.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.900
-Oh, well, thank you for that.
-You're welcome. Now do it.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:10.600
All right.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.500
Amanda, can I borrow
your napkin, please?

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.000
Yes.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.800
Your glasses.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.500
Pass me those when I need them.

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.900
Amanda, you're gonna love this.

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:26.400
It's so funny. I mean, you'll fall
off your chair, it's so funny.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.100
Hello.

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.200
Hello, my name is Mr. Napkin Head.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.600
-Hello, children.
-Who's this? She's a stranger?

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.200
-Amanda.
-And why has she got a funny accent?

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.900
-Amanda.
-Yeah, but where is she from?

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.500
Now smoke!

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.000
Go on.

01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.000
Smoking's really bad for you.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.400
Amanda, guess what.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:03.500
We have a tent in our playroom.
Do you want to see it?

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.700
No, no, no. Amanda...

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:09.100
...will not crawl into your tent.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.700
You don't like tents?

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.300
Okay, this is seriously cool.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.500
Come inside.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.500
-Lie down.
-Okay.

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:34.600
Here, Amanda.
You can use my pillow.

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.300
-Thank you.
-Lie down!

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.300
Can you please
stop being so bossy?

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:42.000
-Lie down, please, next to me.
-Okay.

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.400
very nice.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.200
Excuse me.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.400
This is an exceptionally great tent.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.000
It's got something, hasn't it?

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:03.200
-lt's cozy.
-Yeah.

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.600
Who cut out
all these beautiful stars?

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.900
-We did.
-The Three Musketeers!

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:21.700
Amanda?

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.700
-Yes?
-You smell lovely.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.100
Do l?

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:31.000
Yes. I love perfume,
but he won't let me wear it.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.000
Because you already smell so good.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.900
-So do you, by the way.
-Thanks.

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:40.800
-But l'm older, so I guess l'm allowed.
-Exactly.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.500
I like your eye shadow.

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.100
Thank you.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.100
-And your lipstick.
-Thank you.

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.200
-lt's new.
-What's it called?

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.000
I think it's called Berry Kiss.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.800
very Berry Kiss it is.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.300
Berry Kiss.

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:05.300
Let's see? It looks good on you.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.800
Amanda?

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:11.500
You know, if you wanted to sleep over,
that would be all right.

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:13.200
We could push our beds together.

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.300
Sorry.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.300
That's so sweet of you
to invite me...

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.900
...but maybe another time.
Would that be all right?

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.100
Yes.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.500
Good girl.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.100
We never have grownups here
that are girls.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.800
I know.

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.200
I really like it.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.000
Me too.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.300
I can't imagine anyone being
a bigger hit with my children.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.500
They're really great, Graham.

01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:12.200
Sophie's unfortunately taken
on the role as my protector.

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.700
She's brilliant, but I hate it
when she worries about me.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.500
And Olivia's...

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:19.900
...gonna be a real ball-buster.

01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:23.100
Which, I must admit,
I kind of love about her.

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:26.700
I'm trying to figure out
why you didn't tell me about them.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.300
Because I just don't usually
tell women about them.

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.500
But it's just a little confusing...

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.300
...because you're the one
who wanted to go out to lunch...

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.000
...to get to know one another.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.200
When you put it that way,
it sounds awful.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.100
I have no defense. Except that until
I get to know someone really well...

01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:48.600
...it's easier for me to
be a normal, single guy.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.800
Because it's way too complicated
to be who I really am.

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.200
I'm a full-time dad.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.600
I'm a working parent.
I'm a mother and a father.

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:03.000
I'm a guy who reads parenting books
and cookbooks before I go to sleep.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.700
I spend my weekends buying tutus.
I'm learning to sew.

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:08.500
I'm Mr. Napkin Head!

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.600
I'm on some kind of
constant overload and it helps...

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:17.500
...to compartmentalize my life.
Just till I figure this out.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:20.800
This past weekend, the children
were with their grandparents.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.100
And when they're gone,
I get to be somebody...

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.500
...who doesn't have hot chocolate
spilled on his jeans.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:32.100
I have no idea how to date
and be this.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.600
And I suppose there's...

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.300
...the possibility l'm afraid
of what another person...

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.700
...might do to who we are...

01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:43.300
...and how we get from
one day to the next.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.300
Yeah.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:53.700
I guess since I am
leaving in a week, l...

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.000
I sort of get you not telling me.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:01.000
-Sort of.
-I thought it would be hard...

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:04.100
...to introduce them to someone
I may never see again.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.100
Right.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:16.000
Because l'm just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:20.700
I thought I was just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.600
Oh, man.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:26.900
I think we just went
way past complicated.

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:31.400
Right. I'm a book editor
from London. You're a...

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:33.800
...beautiful...

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.100
...movie trailer-maker from L.A.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.200
We're worlds apart.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.100
I have a cow in the back yard.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.500
-You have a cow?
-Yeah.

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.400
I sew and I have a cow.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.100
How's that for hard to relate to?

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.000
Pretty up there.

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.200
Exactly.

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:15.400
-Morning, Jesus.
-Good morning.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.500
-Santa Anas?
-Oh, yeah, long time now.

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:20.100
-Hi, Marta.
-Hi, lris.

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:24.700
Hi there.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.400
Hello!

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.800
Good morning.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.700
I counted.

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:34.100
Nine movies are opening today.

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:37.200
I remember when nine movies
would open in a month.

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:42.900
Now a picture has to make a killing
the first weekend or they're dead.

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.000
This is supposed to be conducive
to great work?

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.500
Arthur, have you always
been this feisty?

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.800
Well, I may have slowed down
a little, but yes.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.300
You've gotta fight the fight, kid.

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:57.400
Okay, your mail.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.100
Gas company, phone bill.

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:04.900
And a letter from the
Writers Guild of America, West.

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.900
Are you watching the movies
I recommended?

01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:14.000
Yes! Love them.
Irene Dunne is fantastic.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:17.500
-Gumption.
-Oh, my God, tons of it.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.100
Arthur, don't you want to open that
letter you just threw in the bin?

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.800
No. They keep writing me
about the same thing.

01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.600
But it might be important.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:30.600
It's not. They want to arrange
some kind of tribute to me.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.600
A night with me.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.400
I don't know. It sounds God-awful.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.500
What are you talking about?
That sounds brilliant!

01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:43.500
Would you like to walk out on a stage,
on a walker, looking 100 years old...

01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:46.600
...and see 11 schnooks
who showed up just to see you?

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.600
They can forget it.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.700
I ain't falling for this.

01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:54.300
So now, what's up?

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:56.200
May l?

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.500
"An Evening With Arthur Abbott."

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.800
"Dear Mr. Abbott... ...several
attempts to contact you regarding..."

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
"We have not yet received
your response.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.500
This special night
will be a tribute to your...

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:19.800
...Iifetime screenwriting achievement
and contribution to the profession.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Congratulations on this
much-deserved honor."

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.400
Arthur, this is a big deal.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.800
You know, and they want
to do this soon.

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:31.900
Listen, I reckon
that with a little bit of exercise...

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:33.800
...you could walk out on your own.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.600
And, you know,
maybe I could go with you.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.900
As, like, your date or something.

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:43.700
I would take you proudly,
my darling, but l'm not going.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:49.200
Anyway, how would you propose
to get me in shape? Seriously.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.700
Easy.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.000
You're doing really well.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.900
Nearly there. Nearly there.
Nearly there.

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:02.500
Bravo! Here we go,
back the other way.

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.500
-You okay?
-Yeah, l'm fine.

01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:13.200
-You sure?
-Yeah, I just slipped.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.200
-Hello?
-So are you ever coming home?

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.600
-Oh, my God. Hi.
-How's it going?

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.300
Great. I met a really nice guy.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.700
See? And you said you'd never.
What's he like?

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:45.200
He's really cute. I feel great
when l'm with him...

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:49.400
...which is an entirely new experience.
And he's about 90 years old.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.500
-Come on.
-He's my next-door neighbor.

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:54.900
Or Amanda's next-door neighbor.
By the way, you should go meet her.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:59.300
-Yeah. I have, actually.
-Oh, bugger. Call waiting.

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:02.400
Can you hold for a sec? Hold on.
I really wanna talk to you.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.400
-Sure.
-Hello.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.800
-lris, hi, it's Amanda.
-How are you? How's it going?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
-Everything's great. How are you?
-Oh, I'm loving it.

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:13.700
Can you hold for a sec?
My brother's on the other line.

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.100
-Graham?
-Yes. He said you met.

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.700
-Yes, we did meet. How is he?
-Fine, I think.

01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:21.600
-Can you just hold on for a sec?
-Sure.

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:25.400
-Okay. Hi, sorry. That was Amanda.
-How'd she sound?

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.100
-How is she doing?
-She just asked me how you are.

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.300
-And what did you say?
-I asked her to hold.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:33.500
-Can I call you back?
-I can hold while you speak to her.

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.400
-Really?
-Find out how she is.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.200
Okay. My brother wants to know
how you are.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:43.500
Can you tell him l'm good and that
l'm just walking Charlie in the village.

01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:46.500
-What's he been up to? Did he say?
-l'm not sure.

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:49.500
-Do you want me to ask him?
-Sure.

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.900
Okay. Hold, please.

01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:57.300
I can't believe that you have had sex
with the woman staying in my house!

01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.700
He told you that?

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:01.800
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.600
Oh, my God. I thought I was talking
to Graham! Can you just hold, please?

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.900
I'm terribly sorry.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:10.500
I can't believe you
had sex with Amanda!

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:13.600
The one thing she asked me was,
"Are there any men in your town?"

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:15.600
I assured her that there were not.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.300
Then you meet her and immediately
get into her knickers!

01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:20.900
Still me.

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:23.800
Bollocks! I must have lost him.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.400
Amanda, I am so sorry.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.600
Can I call you back?

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.900
-Sure.
-Okay, bye.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.800
Yes, hello.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.800
It's Miles. Am I in trouble?

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.900
Oh, Miles. Hi.

01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.700
What are you up to
this Christmas Eve?

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:46.900
Not much. But in a little bit...

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:50.400
...I'm gonna go to the video shop
and get the next movie on Arthur's list.

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.300
Do you want some company?

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.200
Love some.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:00.400
Hey, I got you the best drink
in town, but I didn't know...

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.400
...if you liked a little dollop
of whipped cream or a big one...

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.400
...so I got both and you can have
each one... Hello, big dollop!

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.600
-Say, you look great, by the way.
-Thanks.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.900
-Really great.
-Thanks, l'm feeling good.

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:13.700
I've been working out with Arthur.

01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.100
-What?
-No.

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:19.300
I'm sure it's an awesome workout.
I'm sorry. I'm trying not to picture it.

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:22.200
Okay, well, the workout's
not that great, but the conver...

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.700
Stop laughing!

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:28.100
-The conversation is truly fantastic.
-No, that I totally believe.

01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:31.900
Now let me ask you.
Have you seen this?

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:34.400
Chariots of Fire. Loved it.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.700
Such a great score by vangelis.

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.200
He took electronic scores to a new
level. It was groundbreaking.

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.100
I'm gonna test you on this later.
Okay. Driving Miss Daisy.

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.700
Hans. very unexpected.
Do you remember how great it was?

01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.700
Sassy! Love it.

01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:02.200
-ls this a bad game?
-No!

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.900
-Okay.
-Keep going.

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:06.400
Sometimes I get self-conscious
about my...

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:10.500
And:

01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:18.800
Are you embarrassed
By this game I've start.ed to play?

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.300
Okay. It's not a library.
I can go loud.

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.100
Two notes and you've got a villain.

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.800
I don't know what to say about it.
Totally brill.

01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:38.600
I bet you didn't know that was all
written for the movie. It was a score.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.600
-I did know that one.
-Can't go anywhere.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:44.100
Oh, my God. Okay, this one?
You have to check this out some time.

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.500
The Mission.
The score is genius.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:50.000
It just comes from
a totally different place. It's like...

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:53.900
I can't even... Just promise me
you'll rent it and listen to it.

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.700
-Renting.
-Thank you.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:56.900
It changed my world.

01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.600
What?

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.200
Maggie!

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:32.800
-Why do I always fall for the bad girl?
-You didn't know she was a bad girl.

01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:36.100
I knew she wasn't good.

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:39.600
Do you have anything
a little bit stronger?

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:44.200
Thank you. Let me rephrase this:

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:50.700
Why am I attracted to a person
I know isn't good?

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.500
I happen to know the answer to this.
You're hoping you're wrong.

01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.400
She does something that tells you
she's no good, you ignore it.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.700
Every time she comes through and
surprises you, she wins you over...

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:05.500
...and you lose that argument
with yourself that she's not for you.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Exactly.

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.100
And on top of that,
there's the old standby:

01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:13.300
"l can't believe a girl like that
would be with a guy like me."

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.900
You know what she said
to me tonight?

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.400
She finished in Santa Fe
after two days...

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.800
...and has been staying with
whatever-his-name-was.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.900
Which means she's been
right here in town.

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.100
When I spoke to her this morning
on her cell and she said:

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:28.400
"l'm looking out my window
and it's snowing."

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.100
She was in Santa Monica.

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.100
What did she do,
go to Weather.com?

01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:35.400
That must have made them
scream with laughter.

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:39.600
And in the meantime, I sent her
Christmas gift to Santa Fe yesterday.

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.500
I stood in line at FedEx
to make sure she got it on time.

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.400
Classic, right?

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:50.800
I don't wanna ruin your Christmas Eve.
You don't have to listen to this.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.900
It's okay.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.900
I like the company.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.300
So how about some food?

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:04.100
Shall I make us
a little Christmas fettuccine?

01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:07.400
-Sure.
-Listen.

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:11.700
I know it's hard to believe people
when they say, "l know how you feel."

01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:16.000
But I actually know how you feel.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.200
You see...

01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:21.500
...I was...

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:25.900
...seeing someone back in London.

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.500
We worked for
the same newspaper.

01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:33.200
And then I found out that he was
also seeing this other girl, Sarah...

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.300
...from the Circulation Department
on the 19th floor.

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:41.100
It turned out that he wasn't
in love with me like I thought.

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:46.100
What l'm trying to say is...

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:49.800
...I understand feeling
as small and as insignificant...

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.500
...as humanly possible.

01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:57.400
How it can actually ache in places that
you didn't know you had inside you.

01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:00.900
It doesn't matter how many
new haircuts you get...

01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:03.100
...or gyms you join...

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.500
...or how many glasses of chardonnay
you drink with girlfriends.

01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:10.300
You still go to bed every night
going over every detail...

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:16.000
...and wonder what you did wrong
or how you could have misunderstood.

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:19.300
And how in the hell,
for that brief moment...

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.800
...you could think that you were
that happy?

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
And sometimes you can
even convince yourself...

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.900
...that he'll see the light
and show up at your door.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.700
And after all that...

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:35.400
...however long "all that" may be...

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.700
...you'll go somewhere new.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.600
And you'll meet people who make you
feel worthwhile again.

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:48.000
And little pieces of your soul
will finally come back.

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:49.800
And all that fuzzy stuff...

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:56.600
...those years of your life
that you wasted...

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.100
...that will eventually begin to fade.

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.400
Well, fuck.

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.300
You need this more than I do.

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.200
That's what you're doing here?
You're getting over somebody?

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.900
Yeah.

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.000
This is me in good shape.

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.900
Is this the guy who sent you pages
from his novel?

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.100
Yeah.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000
He needs me.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:27.700
So he stays in touch?

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:30.200
All the time.

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.800
That makes it impossible to forget,
which is great for him, sucks for you.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.300
You see how great your life is
compared to mine?

01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:42.000
Okay, let's go.
I'm making you some fettuccine.

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:45.700
It is Christmas Eve, and we
are going to sit out on that patio...

01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:48.500
...gonna make ourselves a little fire,
pop some bubbly...

01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:52.100
...and we are gonna celebrate
being young and being alive.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.800
You with me, Simpkins?

01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.900
Miles.

01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:03.300
You really are
an incredibly decent man.

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.500
I know.

01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:08.500
That's always been my problem.

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.700
Hi.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.900
Okay, here it is.

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.700
Arthur's theme.
I think this is really good.

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:48.000
-l'm serious.
-No, I know.

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.800
I'm making him a CD of this tune.
Every time he hears it...

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.700
...it should give him the confidence
to walk right out there.

01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:55.000
-Okay?
-Yep.

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.900
Here we go.

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:02.400
Did I steal this?

01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:06.000
-John Williams.
-I didn't write it, that's why.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.600
-Okay, this is it for real.
-Okay.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.400
-Here we go.
-Yep.

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:13.000
A little Arthur and the knights.

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500
Right? It's cheeky.

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:23.000
It sounds like him.

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.000
I also wrote one
that sounds like you.

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.600
You did?

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.000
Iris, if you were a melody.

01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:46.600
I used only the good notes.

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:03.100
Iris lives next door

01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:08.600
To Art.hur
He's a doodle-ee-doo

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:11.300
-And also a doodle-ee-doo
-Scroodle-ee-doo

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:14.000
-A scroodle-ee-doo? I didn't know that.
-Yeah.

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.800
-And froodle-ee-doo
-And froodle-ee-doo

01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:17.700
We both said "froodle-ee."

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.400
I'm impressed.

01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:20.800
You are a prodigy.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.300
A "doodle" prodigy.

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:24.000
Swoodle-ee-doo

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.200
So you're totally great.

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.500
Yeah.

01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:47.000
This is a bitch.

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:53.100
Well, you must come to London
all the time for work, right?

01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:55.000
London?

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:56.900
Never.

01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.500
New York?

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.200
Not really, but that's easier.
Do you go there often?

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:05.500
Rarely.

01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.800
Long-distance relationships
can work.

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.100
Really? I can't make one work...

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:12.300
...when I live in the same house
with someone.

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.100
So this could be
a good solution for you.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.900
Oh, man.

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:24.200
Okay.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.500
Let's say we just make this happen.

01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:29.100
We commit to flying back and forth
as much as we can.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.500
Yes! It's doable, definitely.

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:35.100
And then let's say
in six months we hit a wall.

01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:37.700
Like, I can't constantly
be away from work...

01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:40.400
...or the girls can't deal with you
leaving so often.

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.700
And we start to feel the tension.
We know this isn't gonna work...

01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:47.100
...so we start fighting because
we don't know what else to do.

01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:49.400
And then, after a long, tearful...

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.300
At your end. ...phone call...

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.600
-...we just... We say goodbye.
-Thank you.

01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:57.000
That'll be it, for real. It's not like
we'll ever bump into each other.

01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:00.100
And then what's left?
Two miserable people...

01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.800
...feeling totally mashed up
and hurt.

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:12.000
Or...

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.300
Thank you.

01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:19.600
Or maybe we should just...

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:23.600
...realize that what we've had these
past few weeks has been perfect.

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.500
And maybe it won't
get any better than this.

01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.800
Maybe we're trying to figure
this thing out...

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
...because it makes us
feel good to feel this.

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:33.200
Maybe the fact
that l'm leaving in 8 hours...

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:37.300
...makes this far more exciting
than it might actually be.

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.000
Maybe.

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:43.300
You are, seriously,
the most depressing girl l've ever met.

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.300
I know.

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.700
I have another scenario for you.

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:53.400
-Good.
-l'm in love with you.

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.700
I apologize for the blunt delivery.

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.300
But as problematical as this...

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:08.400
...fact may be, I am in love.

01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.300
With you.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I'm not feeling this
because you're leaving.

01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:16.200
And not because it feels good
to feel this way.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.300
Which, by the way, it does...
Or did, before you went off like that.

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.600
I can't figure out
the mathematics of this.

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.800
I just know I love you.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.700
Can't believe how many times
l'm saying it.

01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:32.400
And I never thought l'd feel this way
again, so that's pretty phenomenal.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.600
And I realize I come
with a package deal:

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:39.400
Three for the price of one. And my...

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:43.200
...package, perhaps in the light of day,
isn't all that wonderful...

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:48.600
...but I finally know what I want,
and that, in itself, is a miracle.

01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:52.200
And what I want...

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.300
...is you.

01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.000
I wasn't expecting "l love you."

01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:17.100
Can you not look at me like that?

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:19.900
I'm trying to find
the right thing to say.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.400
I think if the obvious response...

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.200
...doesn't immediately
come to you, we can...

01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:32.000
...just...

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.200
We should just...

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.100
...talk about something else.

01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:41.500
Like, possibly,
what a complete ass I am.

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:46.600
I do recall you promising me
you wouldn't fall in love with me.

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.100
Must pay better attention.

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:50.900
I've never met a guy
who talks as much as me.

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:53.600
But could you just for now...

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:56.000
...be quiet?

01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:57.300
Please?

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.500
How many of his movies
are on that list of his?

01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:18.300
About 15. I love it.

01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:21.300
I don't know how l've never seen
The Lady Eve before.

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.200
Barbara Stanwyck is dazzling.

01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.200
-And she's so sure of herself.
-And sexy.

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.900
Really sexy! You know,
every movie he's told me to see...

01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.900
-...has this powerhouse woman in it.
-Wonder if he's trying...

01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:36.900
...to tell you something with that.
Okay, sorry about that. Boob graze.

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:41.600
That was accidental.
Accidental boob graze.

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:46.000
I'm sorry.

01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:49.600
-Changing subject.
-Okay.

01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:52.400
Arthur has requested...

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:55.700
...that you write some lyrics
for his theme song.

01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:57.600
What's the matter? Who is it?

01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:58.800
It's Maggie.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.200
Hello?

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.600
Hi.

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:09.400
I'm doing okay.

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:15.500
Actually, Maggie,
l'm a bit tied up at the moment.

01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:18.800
I don't know.
What time could you be there?

01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.300
All right, l'll be there.

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:25.800
Oh, no, no. Like, a half-hour.

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:28.800
Maybe a little longer.

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.900
Okay, bye.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.600
She misses me.

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.600
You see? She came to her senses.

01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:47.700
-We should get the bill.
-No!

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:50.300
No, no, take your time.
I can wait till you're finished.

01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:51.500
-l'm finished.
-No.

01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:55.400
-You didn't get to your spicy tuna yet.
-l'm fine, really.

01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:58.800
You can go. I can get this one.

01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:02.900
I'll see you later at the Writers Guild.
I mean, if you can still make it.

01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:06.500
I gotta get all the way to Silver Lake,
but l'm gonna try to be there.

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:10.400
Anyway, l'm bringing the music.
I mean, I really wanna be there...

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.900
...but I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:14.400
I'm sorry.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.200
It's all good. Don't worry.

01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:24.300
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:17.000
Hello.

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:22.300
Oh, Jasper! I'm just reading
your pages.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.800
No, I hadn't forgotten.
I've just been busy, that's all.

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:31.000
That's not true. I was gonna call you
when l'd read...

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.000
What kind of surprise?

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:34.700
No, I don't see a box or anything.

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:36.900
Yes, l'm sure.

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.800
Hold on, let me just check
the kitchen.

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:44.300
No, not in there.

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.100
Well, l'll go and check the gate.

01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:50.000
Yes. Well, when did you send it?

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.700
I found your Christmas present.

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.600
This place suits you.

01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:08.500
Yeah, right.

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.500
No, really.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.900
So you are eventually
gonna look at me, aren't you?

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.500
Hello.

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:33.400
I came here
because I had to see you.

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.300
Had to.

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:40.100
Oh, Jasper, I really don't
understand this.

01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:41.900
I mean...

01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:46.400
I was right there for three years!
Remember? Square peg, round hole?

01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:48.600
-What?
-That's what you said.

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:50.800
That we weren't really right
for each other.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.600
We were a square peg
and a round hole.

01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:56.500
I don't remember that. I just know
I hated when you were gone.

01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:59.200
And also, I have never checked
my e-mails more.

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:02.500
It was driving me crazy
that I wasn't hearing from you.

01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:05.700
I don't want to lose you, babe.

01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:09.900
Lose me?

01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.400
This is too confusing.

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:19.900
Come here.

01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:26.300
I screwed up.
Miles, haven't you ever screwed up?

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.700
I made a mistake.

01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:32.100
I was stupid and impulsive.

01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:35.500
He wasn't what I thought.
I just started thinking about you...

01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:38.800
...and wishing and hoping
that you would just forgive me.

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.700
Will you, Miles?

01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:43.900
Will you forgive me?

01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:00.800
You know what I was thinking?

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.300
When you get back to London...

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:05.300
...maybe we could sneak off
somewhere together.

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.200
Maybe venice.

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:09.000
You and me in venice
could be good.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.400
Do you mean that? I mean...

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.900
Are you free to do that?

01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:18.600
Darling...

01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:22.800
...I've just traveled halfway across
the world to see you, haven't l?

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:32.500
Yeah, that doesn't exactly
answer my question, so...

01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:36.800
Are you not with
Sarah anymore? I mean...

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.400
...is that what you've come here
to tell me?

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:44.200
I wish you could just accept knowing
how confused I am about all this.

01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:49.200
Okay, let me translate that.

01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:52.800
So you are still engaged
to be married.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.800
-Yes, but, I mean...
-Oh, my God.

01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:03.000
Okay, this was a really...

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.300
...close call.

01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:07.100
You know, I never thought
l'd say this, literally never...

01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:10.300
...but I think you were
absolutely right about us.

01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.700
very square peg, very round hole!

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:16.700
-You cannot mean that.
-The great thing is I actually do.

01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:19.200
And l'm about three years late
in telling you this...

01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.100
...but nevertheless I need to say it.

01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:24.000
Jasper...

01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:25.400
Wait. I need the lights on.

01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:30.900
Jasper...

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.500
...you have never treated me right.

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:37.300
-Ever.
-Oh, babe.

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:41.300
You broke my heart.

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.900
And you acted like
somehow it was my fault...

01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:47.000
...my misunderstanding,
and I was too in love with you...

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:51.000
...to ever be mad at you, so I just
punished myself! For years!

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.200
But you waltzing in here
on my lovely Christmas holiday...

01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.600
...and telling me that
you don't want to lose me...

01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:00.200
...whilst you're
about to get married...

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.100
...somehow newly entitles me
to say...

01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:06.300
...it's over.

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:12.500
This... This twisted,
toxic thing between us...

01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.800
...is finally finished!

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.800
I'm miraculously done
being in love with you!

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.200
I've got a life to start living.

01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:26.500
-And you're not going to be in it.
-Darling...

01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.000
Now l've got somewhere
really important to be...

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.100
...and you have
got to get the hell out.

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:35.000
-Now!
-What exactly has got into you?

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.400
I don't know.

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:41.400
But I think what l've got
is something slightly resembling...

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:43.000
...gumption.

01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:09.700
Iris...

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.200
...you're a knockout.

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:13.800
Thank you.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.900
-And may I say, so are you.
-Did I do my tie okay?

01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:21.200
I haven't worn one in 15 years.

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:25.600
-lt's perfect.
-I like this Hugo Boss.

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:27.300
He cuts a nice suit.

01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:30.400
I've got something for you.

01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:42.700
Forgive me. The last time
I had a date, this is what we did.

01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:45.200
It's beautiful.

01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:50.100
If it's corny, or if it's
going to ruin your outfit...

01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:52.600
...you don't have to wear it.

01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:55.800
I like corny.

01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:58.400
I'm looking for corny in my life.

01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:03.000
-That's a nice line.
-lt's all those movies!

01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:05.700
Okay, let's do it.

01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:08.100
Let's get this embarrassment
over with.

01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:10.200
Okay.

01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:19.900
-Mr. Abbott?
-Yes, sir.

01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:22.200
We're all ready for you.

01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:39.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Arthur Abbott!

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
-Oh, hi!
-Arthur, you made it.

02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:07.500
Thank you. Thank you too.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Thank you very much.

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:19.700
I'll take you up, Mr. Abbott.

02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:23.300
Go on, go for it.

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:41.600
I'll do it.

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:55.500
The man is a rock star.

02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:57.500
Hi!

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Sorry l'm late. The Maggie thing
took a little time, but it is over.

02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.100
Finished, kaput.

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:09.200
You look beautiful.

02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:12.200
Thank you.

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.800
Thanks.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.800
Thank you, thank you.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.300
I'm...

02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:20.900
I'm absolutely overwhelmed...

02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:23.400
...that I could climb those stairs.

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:25.700
He did great.

02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:29.900
I came to Hollywood
over 60 years ago...

02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:32.700
...and immediately fell in love
with motion pictures.

02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:37.100
And it's a love affair
that's lasted a lifetime.

02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:40.200
When I first arrived in Tinseltown...

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.100
...there were no cineplexes
or multiplexes.

02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:48.500
No such thing as a
Blockbuster or DvD.

02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:52.000
I was here before conglomerates
owned the studios.

02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:56.200
Before pictures
had special effects teams.

02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:00.000
And definitely before box office
results were reported...

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.500
...Iike baseball scores
on the nightly news.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
He is so fantastic.

02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:10.400
-lris?
-Yes?

02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:13.000
What are you doing
New Year's Eve?

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.400
I'll be back in England
by New Year's Eve.

02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:22.600
You know, l've never been
to England.

02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:26.200
-l've never been to Europe.
-No?

02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:29.600
If I come over there, will you go out
with me on New Year's Eve?

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:35.700
Love to.

02:02:56.900 --> 02:02:59.800
We're not gonna make a bigger deal
out of this than it already is.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.400
No, we're not.

02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:04.100
It's not like we're never
going to speak or e-mail or...

02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:07.200
-No set rules.
-None.

02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:11.700
So now l'm just gonna
kiss you for the millionth time...

02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.400
...and say, "Be seeing you."

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.300
Be seeing you.

02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:38.200
Take care of yourself.

02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:42.000
Did you have a good holiday, miss?

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.400
Yeah.

02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:46.500
Great.

02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.500
Maybe the best ever.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.900
Amanda Woods...

02:05:48.100 --> 02:05:49.800
...welcome back.

02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:53.700
Turn around!

02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:56.100
Turn around and go back, please!

02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:59.800
-Did you forget something?
-Yes! Yes.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.300
Can you go any faster?

02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:14.300
This lane's tricky.
It's gonna take a bit.

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:15.800
It's okay, just stop.

02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:23.400
Madam?

02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:26.000
Madam!

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:22.800
Graham?

02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:25.700
Graham.

02:07:38.100 --> 02:07:39.700
You know...

02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:42.200
...I was just thinking...

02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:45.800
...why would I ever leave
before New Year's Eve?

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.900
That makes no sense at all.

02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:51.800
I mean, you didn't exactly
ask me out...

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.400
...but you did say you loved me...

02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:59.400
...so l'm thinking l've got a date.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.100
If you'll have me.

02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:05.700
I have the girls New Year's Eve.

02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:09.900
Sounds perfect.

02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:31.400
I'm coming to get you!

02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:35.900
You look just like an angel
on the top of the Christmas tree.

02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:38.600
You got so big. Give us a kiss.

02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:41.900
Come and tell me all about
your Christmas presents.

02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:43.700
Go sit with Miles.

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:54.600
Sweetie.

02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:34.400
-I challenge ye.
-Me?

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.100
The love train
is leaving the station.

02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:14.100
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:16.300
Happy New Year!

02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:20.500
Happy New Year, everybody!
