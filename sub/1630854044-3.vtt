00:02.169 --> 00:03.168
You ready for your interview?

00:03.204 --> 00:05.187
-Yeah, I am.
-How about we talk
over lunch?

00:05.206 --> 00:07.239
-How about over a drink?
-Even better.

00:07.291 --> 00:09.074
Not bad, rookie. Ten k,
your first time around.

00:09.126 --> 00:10.125
Oh! [laughs]

00:11.361 --> 00:12.995
[nova]<i> so did you call him?</i>

00:13.030 --> 00:14.163
I told him that
I need more time.

00:14.198 --> 00:16.198
In or out? Make a choice.

00:16.217 --> 00:19.918
Not much is ever
in our favor
and we are still here.

00:21.839 --> 00:23.489
It's my land now, violet.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.207
Ms. Parthena filed
more than three months ago.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.625
Sorry, I can't help you.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.811
-[parthena crying]
they're taking my...
-Hey!

00:28.846 --> 00:30.012
They're taking... [crying]

[ralph angel sighs]

00:38.889 --> 00:40.856
[darla] mmm,
sweet girl's tired.

00:42.359 --> 00:43.192
Wanna go down?

00:44.328 --> 00:45.244
Why don't you go down
for a nap?

00:47.531 --> 00:48.530
[darla sighs]

00:51.669 --> 00:53.419
the eviction
wasn't your fault.

00:54.922 --> 00:56.004
Which one?

00:59.343 --> 01:00.426
You're beating yourself up.

01:02.079 --> 01:03.178
I wish you wouldn't.

01:04.348 --> 01:06.882
Parthena, she will be okay.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.351
She has us,

01:10.354 --> 01:11.553
she has family,

01:12.857 --> 01:14.807
she has people
that will take care of her.

01:14.859 --> 01:16.892
Ms. Parthena's a proud woman.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.112
She was looking
after herself...

01:22.566 --> 01:23.732
...And they took that
from her...

01:24.452 --> 01:26.034
...And her land.

01:26.070 --> 01:27.903
-I mean, who's next?
-No one.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.205
If we can help it.

01:30.241 --> 01:32.607
We ain't got the kind
of money to help nobody, so...

01:32.626 --> 01:35.077
[darla] ralph angel,
this is not all on you.

01:35.112 --> 01:37.913
Times like these
are exactly why
we started the co-op.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.916
-To protect each other.
-And it didn't work

01:41.585 --> 01:43.168
'cause we ain't protected.

01:43.220 --> 01:45.104
[darla] it doesn't mean
we won't win the next one.

01:46.390 --> 01:48.340
Look, ralph angel, I...

01:48.392 --> 01:52.427
I know and you're right
and I agree with you.

01:53.797 --> 01:58.066
[sighs] we do need
to turn a larger profit,
but we're close.

02:00.938 --> 02:01.937
Gotta go.

You looking at a real

02:47.801 --> 02:49.484
Remember that photo
I showed y'all before?

02:50.437 --> 02:51.486
I sold it...

02:51.521 --> 02:53.021
...As a nft.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.489
-Wow.
-Nice.

02:54.524 --> 02:56.108

-[micah] thank you.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.309
[laughing]

02:57.344 --> 02:59.861
although selling doesn't
make you an artist.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.797
It just means
the nft's commercial.

03:01.832 --> 03:03.081
But it's the one you liked.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.583
It's artistic and commercial.

03:04.635 --> 03:07.502
Making money is exciting,
but it can't be your end goal.

03:08.839 --> 03:10.538
Think about
what you're saying,

03:10.558 --> 03:13.425
your message,
what you're putting out
into the world.

Rahad's weary that
the tech bros are getting
their grift on.

03:33.397 --> 03:38.233
-So, are you two together
or what?
-What?

03:38.252 --> 03:40.619
Yeah, I mean, I'm cool
either way.

03:40.671 --> 03:43.288
I'm just curious and...

03:43.324 --> 03:45.507
...Wanted you to know
you can tell me anything.

03:46.176 --> 03:47.259
Like, we're friends, right?

03:47.845 --> 03:49.511
We used to be a lot more.

03:49.546 --> 03:51.579

-So, this guy?
-We're just friends.

03:59.273 --> 04:02.307
-Like, he's in the frat
with me. His name's isaiah.
-All right.

04:02.359 --> 04:04.359
Good. No labels. Perfect.

04:04.395 --> 04:05.760
[both laugh]

04:05.779 --> 04:07.863
um, but you're single now?

04:07.898 --> 04:08.947
Where is this going?

04:10.034 --> 04:12.567
I am kind of
a legendary wingman.

04:12.602 --> 04:14.870
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm-hmm. You can
ask any of my friends.

04:15.605 --> 04:16.738
So, you looking?

04:17.941 --> 04:19.374
-Open?
-[laughs]

04:19.410 --> 04:21.209
I mean, I date.

04:22.246 --> 04:23.545
Good.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.881
My friends still can't
believe I dated micah west.

04:25.916 --> 04:27.582
Word, you been talking
to them about me?

04:27.617 --> 04:30.618
Oh, I set them straight.
I told them you would never
have made it

04:30.638 --> 04:31.837
in st. Jo if it wasn't for me.

04:31.889 --> 04:33.588
[laughs] yeah,
you probably right.

04:33.623 --> 04:34.756
[keke laughs]

04:38.979 --> 04:41.430
sorry that we had
to move our meeting up.

04:41.465 --> 04:43.148
We had a family emergency
last night.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.150
Is everything all right?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.436
No, not really.

04:47.471 --> 04:49.971
But we didn't wanna
have to reschedule again.

04:49.990 --> 04:54.109
With everything [sighs]
getting back to normal,

04:54.144 --> 04:56.528
my niece, darla, has been
on me to take

04:56.580 --> 04:59.147
vi's pies national like you
and I tried to do.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.783
When looking
at comparable businesses,

05:01.818 --> 05:03.785
we think there's
a real opportunity here.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.987
The market for frozen--

05:06.006 --> 05:10.325
I'm sure your business plan
is brilliant, um, and...

05:10.344 --> 05:13.095
I hope I didn't
waste your time, but...

05:13.130 --> 05:14.629
...I don't think
I can help you right now.

05:15.599 --> 05:16.548
Why not?

05:16.600 --> 05:18.800
Well, I'm about to retire.

05:19.669 --> 05:20.835
I wanted to tell you
in person.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.804
Well, that's mighty
decent of you.

05:22.839 --> 05:26.108
And congratulations
on the retirement

05:26.143 --> 05:29.844
and I appreciate
your coming all this way.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.698
And you don't think
you're getting off
that easy, do you?

05:33.817 --> 05:34.800
Look.

05:35.986 --> 05:39.020
After the night we had
last night, we know...

05:39.039 --> 05:44.192
...How all our hard work
can be gone in a minute.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.963
So, we gonna get
you a piece of your
favorite pie...

05:47.998 --> 05:49.781
-[chuckles]
-and then,

05:49.817 --> 05:52.501
you gonna walk us
through the steps
of distribution.

05:52.536 --> 05:57.506
You know, your inability
to take no for an answer
is gonna serve you well.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.642
But it's gonna take
more than one piece.

06:00.677 --> 06:03.428
-Well, let's make a deal.
What's your favorite?
-[mr. Rawlings laughs]

06:03.480 --> 06:06.314
and you know I can't
resist your pecan pie.

06:07.217 --> 06:08.517
Pecan it is.

06:08.552 --> 06:12.604
One slice of pecan
for here and two pies
for the road.

06:12.656 --> 06:14.656
Ah, that's a deal.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.408
[mr. Rawlings laughs]

06:26.069 --> 06:27.119
[door closes]

06:27.171 --> 06:28.170
mmm.

06:29.072 --> 06:30.539
Hey, I must have...

06:31.542 --> 06:32.707
I was waiting up for you.

06:34.011 --> 06:35.043
What kept you out all night?

06:37.381 --> 06:39.598
Parthena was evicted
late last night.

06:40.384 --> 06:41.249
We had to be there for her.

06:41.268 --> 06:44.052
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's terrible.

06:44.087 --> 06:45.687
Why didn't you call me?
I would've come over
to help.

06:45.722 --> 06:48.140
I was meeting with mo
when I got the call.
I wasn't thinking.

06:48.192 --> 06:50.058
-I, I drove straight there.
-Mmm.

06:51.428 --> 06:52.444
Co-op mo?

06:53.063 --> 06:54.045
What time was that?

06:55.516 --> 06:59.067
Yeah, after the council vote,
I had an idea.

06:59.102 --> 07:01.319
Mo was telling me
about a ring shout
she saw performed

07:01.371 --> 07:02.854
at the site
where freddie gray was killed.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.373
-Mmm.
-They were up all night
thinking of how to stop

07:05.409 --> 07:07.726
the landrys
from bulldozing our home.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.763
If I could just get people
to really feel
what happened there and...

07:13.300 --> 07:14.433
They just can't...

07:17.271 --> 07:19.871
I'm gonna stage
a ring shout on the land.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.506
I feel like
I'm missing something.

07:21.558 --> 07:24.576
You're planning a ring shout,
you know I'm a cultural
anthropologist.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.396
Well, I teach some
of the modern dances
to my students.

07:28.432 --> 07:30.182
Rashida bumbray,
baquin asetawa

07:30.217 --> 07:32.100
along with the traditions
of the gullah people.

07:32.135 --> 07:35.970
We'll even cover some
of the origins on our field
trip to the sudan next week.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.722
Ah, who's calling the shout?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.858
Are you using a traditional
shout or are you writing
a new one?

07:39.893 --> 07:42.944
'cause I know some people
do it as a performance,
but I would...

07:42.979 --> 07:46.114
Man, I would think
you would want
a more traditional dancer.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.486
-What?
-You're a giant nerd.

07:51.505 --> 07:54.623
-You know that? [laughs]
-so I... Yeah, I have
been told that.

07:54.658 --> 07:57.959
It's not...
I'm not complaining.
It's cute.

07:59.329 --> 08:00.295
Mmm.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.633
Parthena didn't deserve this.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.053
Broke my heart seeing her cry.

08:08.105 --> 08:10.222
She better
than I would've been.

08:10.274 --> 08:11.940
Would've had to drag me out
kicking and screaming.

08:11.975 --> 08:13.525
It's hard to say
until it happens.

08:15.612 --> 08:16.978
I don't wish that on nobody.

08:18.448 --> 08:19.948
What happened was malicious.

08:21.285 --> 08:22.317
It was horrible...

08:24.204 --> 08:25.537
...But we have power.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.006
We have more power

08:28.041 --> 08:29.624
than what they think.

08:31.161 --> 08:33.828
Together we are stronger
than what they know,

08:33.863 --> 08:35.213
but we gotta remember that.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.699
I'm preparing
a complaint to file

08:37.718 --> 08:40.201
with the us da
tomorrow on behalf
of the co-op.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.337
'cause we not gonna
keep taking this abuse.

08:43.674 --> 08:46.541
This has got to stop.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.977
And we, that means all of us,

08:50.314 --> 08:51.179
we gonna end it.

08:55.652 --> 08:56.651
[woman] we got this.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.023
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

09:10.534 --> 09:11.583
Vince?

09:14.004 --> 09:14.869
Hello, sir.

09:17.374 --> 09:18.757
[prosper] you're here.
My goodness.

09:19.426 --> 09:20.709
It's good to see you.

09:20.744 --> 09:21.760
[men laughing]

09:22.579 --> 09:25.413
-yeah, been awhile, son.
-Yeah.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.548
Too long.

09:26.583 --> 09:28.183
-[vince] looking really good.
-Yeah.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.269
Well, it's good to see you.

09:42.899 --> 09:43.898
Hi.

09:46.703 --> 09:47.702
Hi.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.242
How'd you find me?

09:55.746 --> 10:00.815
Well, when the rental car
gps started to go haywire
on the back roads,

10:00.851 --> 10:03.335
here to st. Jo, that was, uh,

10:03.370 --> 10:05.086
that's when I needed
to ask for directions.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.256
Directions that
consisted of...

10:09.909 --> 10:12.427
-...Drive ahead a spell
and turn at the rogers' place.
-[laughing]

10:14.097 --> 10:17.048
so, I asked, um,

10:17.083 --> 10:19.050
what is a spell exactly?

10:19.085 --> 10:22.520
Is it half a mile?
A quarter mile?

10:22.556 --> 10:24.389
Uh, that didn't sit well.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.507
[laughing]

10:26.677 --> 10:28.543
I'm sorry for laughing.

10:28.578 --> 10:34.149
When I finally found
your father's house,
no one was home.

10:34.184 --> 10:37.569
A pickup truck passed by,
thankfully, and they let me
follow them here.

10:37.604 --> 10:40.938
And said this is where
everyone was, so...

10:40.957 --> 10:43.241
You know, and hey,
and I gotta say,

10:43.276 --> 10:45.910
I never expected
to see you up there
getting your norma rae on.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.446
Yeah, well, that makes
two of us

10:48.465 --> 10:51.066
because I didn't expect
to see you just walk in.

10:51.885 --> 10:52.917
Well, I had enough.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.839
Enough of you putting me off.

10:57.891 --> 11:01.509
Enough of giving me
a few hazy details
here and there.

11:01.561 --> 11:04.813
Enough of you telling me
you're coming home
and then you don't.

11:06.216 --> 11:08.249
-It's been over six months.
-I know.

11:08.285 --> 11:10.952
Even lila told me to stop
moping around the house
and do something.

11:10.987 --> 11:15.106
Yeah, well, our daughter
is 19 and watches rom-coms
on the loop.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.424
This is real life.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.278
Oh, so, is it, really?

11:20.313 --> 11:23.198
Like, I have no idea
because...

11:23.250 --> 11:26.117
...If this is your real life,
now I thought this
was the life you were trying

11:26.152 --> 11:27.752
so hard to leave behind
all those years.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.421
It was. It's different now.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.256
Why? How?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.091
Twenty years together,
you never wanted
to come back here.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.376
Never brought the kids.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.044
I never wanted
to be here myself.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.379
And now you don't seem
to wanna leave.

11:37.431 --> 11:39.097
It's not that
I don't wanna leave.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.602
I don't know
what I'm going back to.

11:44.638 --> 11:47.138
You don't know
what you're going back to?
You're going back home.

11:48.608 --> 11:51.109
Back to our children.
Lila, joseph.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.677
Our kids are
in college, vince.

11:52.696 --> 11:54.145
Well then, you're coming
back to me.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.683
Come on, billie.
What's going on?

11:58.702 --> 12:02.153
Vince, I wasn't ready
to have this conversation.
I wasn't.

12:02.706 --> 12:03.705
I'm sorry!

12:04.374 --> 12:05.657
I don't know!

12:14.050 --> 12:17.419
It's not real, but you managed
to sell the ntf anyway?

12:17.454 --> 12:20.138
[laughs] nft.

12:20.173 --> 12:23.191
And it is real,
it's just not a physical
piece of art.

12:23.226 --> 12:24.392
It just stays on the internet.

12:25.028 --> 12:26.461
Okay.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.796
I still don't get it.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.230
Yeah, it's complicated, but...

12:29.900 --> 12:32.317
...It's the future and...

12:32.352 --> 12:35.203
...I'm on the forefront,
which means a lot to me.

12:35.238 --> 12:36.638
Then that's all that matters.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.273
-Yeah.
-It's your own thing.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.774
All right, I get that.

12:39.826 --> 12:43.060
All right, well, I'm gonna
head over to the actual
cultural arts center

12:43.079 --> 12:44.846
and hand out these flyers
about the ring shout.

12:44.881 --> 12:47.515
And stop by the mft,
maybe they wanna see
what this is about.

12:47.551 --> 12:50.001
The more people, the better.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.053
-Hey.
-Hi.

12:52.088 --> 12:54.372
-Well, I didn't know
you were coming. What's up?
-I know, right?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.207
-It's good to see you.
-You too. You too.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.295
I was surprised to hear
I'm still on your list

13:00.347 --> 13:02.130
or did you forget
to take me off?

13:02.165 --> 13:04.199
No, it was intentional.

13:04.234 --> 13:06.100
Even when we're on the outs,
you come through.

13:06.570 --> 13:07.969
You have a gift.

13:08.004 --> 13:11.339
You get people to turn up
when it's important
and this is important.

13:11.374 --> 13:14.008
True and I'll help you
get your numbers up,

13:14.044 --> 13:16.978
but if we're gonna do this,
just remember that
you needed me,

13:17.013 --> 13:18.196
not the other way around.

13:19.916 --> 13:23.234
No comment.
Come on here, girl. [laughs]

13:23.286 --> 13:26.905
<i> ♪ I woke up this morning</i>
<i> so fresh and dry ♪</i>

13:26.940 --> 13:30.525
so, how long were you married
before he passed?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.894
About 25 good years

13:34.047 --> 13:36.764
and about nine more. [laughs]

13:38.084 --> 13:39.300
he was a good man.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.586
Had a hard life.

13:42.973 --> 13:45.390
I'm grateful for that time.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.625
It made me the person
I am today.

13:47.644 --> 13:49.093
-Mmm.
-Hmm.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.479
So did you, uh,

13:52.399 --> 13:53.765
date anyone after?

13:54.818 --> 13:57.318
No one special. And you?

13:59.138 --> 14:05.476
I dated a few lovely women,
but I couldn't stop comparing
them to claire.

14:05.495 --> 14:07.495
Then when covid came along,
I didn't...

14:08.498 --> 14:10.949
...Reach out
to anybody or call.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.920
But I think god look
over sometimes...

14:16.990 --> 14:18.957
...'cause he brought me
to you.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.625
[chuckles]

14:26.349 --> 14:27.649
-prosper?
-Mmm?

14:29.519 --> 14:30.635
You're the sky.

14:32.672 --> 14:33.972
Everything else...

14:35.191 --> 14:36.474
...Is just the weather.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.142
[both laughing]

14:45.151 --> 14:48.185
oh, that's beautiful.
I love it.

14:48.204 --> 14:49.370
-[violet] darla.
-Yeah?

14:50.323 --> 14:52.707
Mr. Rawlings made
my head spin.

14:54.828 --> 14:57.245
There's a lot of hoops
you have to jump through

14:57.297 --> 14:59.080
before you get
the pies to the people.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.865
If we do well here,

15:00.884 --> 15:02.917
then we move up
to the french market next.

15:02.969 --> 15:06.804
I don't know, maybe I'm biting
off more than I can chew.

15:06.840 --> 15:10.174
I mean, I have loyal customers
in st. Jo.

15:10.209 --> 15:13.428
I went from a home kitchen
spot to a local destination.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.015
That is more success
than most businesses ever get.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.317
Ms. Violet bordelon,

15:20.236 --> 15:21.603
is that fear talking?

15:21.655 --> 15:23.721
No, it's sense.

15:23.740 --> 15:24.856
Sounds like fear.

15:25.909 --> 15:28.059
Why are you pushing at me?

15:28.078 --> 15:31.112
Because as long
as I've known you,

15:31.164 --> 15:33.531
you never give up on things
that you want.

15:35.368 --> 15:39.403
And you're saying
that selling my pies here
will do that?

15:39.422 --> 15:42.239
Yeah, I think
it's the next step.

15:42.258 --> 15:45.843
Folks will be lining
all around the block for you.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.763
And if we share a booth
with the co-op,

15:49.933 --> 15:50.882
it's a win-win.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.721
-I'll make sure
to get that set up.
-Okay, great. Thanks.

15:58.391 --> 16:02.259
So, he says that he has
a few stalls open

16:02.278 --> 16:05.730
and that he'd cut you
a discount for the next
two weeks

16:05.765 --> 16:08.449
if you come in now
to fill up the space.

16:09.619 --> 16:10.618
That's perfect.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.071
Darla called earlier,

16:13.106 --> 16:15.373
made it sound like
it'd be a whole month
till we get me in there.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.492
Well, he owes my mom a favor.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.411
-Probably a few.
-Of course.

16:20.446 --> 16:22.246
This place a lot bigger
than I remember.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.415
It's a lot of competition.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.085
You're not gonna screw it up.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.469
Is it that obvious?

16:28.505 --> 16:32.924
First year I was running
the business, I was scared
out of my mind.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.676
Second guessed every decision.

16:34.728 --> 16:38.563
I mean, my mom built it
from nothing and now
it was all on me

16:38.598 --> 16:40.131
to keep it afloat.

16:40.150 --> 16:43.234
They do not make horror
movies as scary as that.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.902
Yeah, that's the thing.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.971
I just wonder
if darla gets it.

16:46.990 --> 16:49.306
-Sometimes, I just feel like--
-okay.

16:49.325 --> 16:50.992
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

16:52.145 --> 16:55.947
I know we're friends,
but we're not...

16:55.982 --> 16:58.199
-...Complain about
spouses friends.
-[laughs]

16:58.251 --> 17:00.868
-come on.
-I would not want my husband
doing that to me.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.371
Man, don't get me wrong,
I got one of the best girls
in the world.

17:03.423 --> 17:07.208
It's just when it comes
to family legacy
and keeping up with all that,

17:07.260 --> 17:08.626
I don't know if darla gets it.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.511
[darla] what don't I get?

17:15.018 --> 17:16.134
What don't I get?

17:33.019 --> 17:34.018
[ralph angel sighs]

17:35.105 --> 17:36.637
look, my bad, about earlier.

17:36.672 --> 17:38.056
You know I don't mean
nothing by it.

17:38.108 --> 17:39.474
[hollywood] mean
nothing by what?

17:41.694 --> 17:43.661
Or do I not wanna know?

17:43.696 --> 17:45.947
Mean nothing by sharing
all of his problems

17:45.982 --> 17:47.448
with his ex-girlfriend
instead of his wife.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.234
Yeah, I really didn't
need to know about that.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.953
[ralph angel] wasn't
even like that,
that's my boss.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.238
Just talking
about family business.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.023
Thought she gets it,
that's all.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.408
I get family businesses.

17:57.460 --> 18:01.412
-I ain't say--
-I have been running
this farm with you for years.

18:01.464 --> 18:03.697
I'm helping vi
and the co-op was my idea.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.833
-I get business.
-I know you get business.

18:05.868 --> 18:07.185
I ain't say you don't
get business.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.003
-That's not what I---
-you know, if you all would--

18:09.038 --> 18:10.004
vi.

18:10.039 --> 18:12.873
I have been trying
to get you to go with me

18:12.892 --> 18:15.143
to the farmer's market
for months.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.396
It was my idea.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.850
So for you to then take
what I've been trying to do

18:23.553 --> 18:24.852
for this family,

18:25.488 --> 18:26.854
for our co-op

18:26.889 --> 18:29.323
-and go run it
with someone else.
-It don't matter how we got...

18:31.161 --> 18:32.660
It don't matter how
we got in the booth.

18:33.696 --> 18:34.712
We got in the booth.

18:35.731 --> 18:36.897
What's the problem?

18:36.916 --> 18:39.233
I shouldn't have to keep
explaining myself
to my husband

18:39.252 --> 18:41.185
and you shouldn't be talking
about me to your boss.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.040
Look, my bad. I'm sorry.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.379
-[darla] I'm not hungry.
-Darla.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.052
Damn.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.806
[prosper] a new coach, new qb,

19:01.858 --> 19:04.025
it's a whole new era
for the saints.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.693
The bears era is coming.

19:05.728 --> 19:08.362
-Oh, sure. [laughs]
-all right? Yeah, no doubt.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.031
[both laugh]

19:11.401 --> 19:14.869
you know, st. Jo really
is a warm, little town.
Good people here.

19:16.939 --> 19:18.656
And your home...

19:18.708 --> 19:21.325
...Is... It's well loved,
well lived in.

19:21.377 --> 19:25.997
This house has let me
back in even when
I didn't deserve it.

19:26.049 --> 19:28.799
Yeah, I don't know
what I was picturing
all these years.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.888
I think I thought it was
this horrible place that...

19:33.923 --> 19:35.556
...Billie never wanted
to come back to.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.677
There were reasons.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.812
[vince] well,
with all due respect,

19:42.632 --> 19:44.065
it's time for me
to know the reasons.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.486
I wanna understand
what's kept you away
for so long.

19:49.739 --> 19:51.155
It affects me too.

19:52.242 --> 19:56.110
Something's changed, billie,
and I need some answers.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.498
I'm sorry if you weren't
ready to see me.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.068
But I'm here now.

20:04.103 --> 20:07.922
Well, it's a little late
for me to start giving
fatherly advice, so I won't.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.924
I just wanna say, vince,

20:11.494 --> 20:14.045
I'm really glad you're here.

20:14.097 --> 20:16.797
You've always been
welcomed in my house
and you always will.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.105
Be true to your own heart.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.144
[door creaks open]

20:36.953 --> 20:38.152
I don't wanna hear it.

20:38.187 --> 20:39.487
[laughs] don't ya?

20:41.157 --> 20:44.358
You went outside
your marriage
to talk about problems

20:44.377 --> 20:47.194
with a woman you used to date.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.463
■ñ
man, any fool could understand
how that was gonna go bad.

20:49.499 --> 20:50.498
It's not like that.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.167
She married, I'm married.

20:54.203 --> 20:55.303
I was just venting.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.472
She ain't wanna
hear it anyway.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.726
That's pretty smart of her.

21:02.545 --> 21:04.145
And you didn't listen because?

21:04.180 --> 21:05.563
And darla's family...

21:06.349 --> 21:07.348
...They just different.

21:08.884 --> 21:11.185
She walked away
from everything
they wanna give her.

21:12.322 --> 21:13.521
She was right to do it.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.574
See, I can't walk away
from mine.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.527
I lost everything
my daddy gave to me.

21:21.998 --> 21:24.198
-I don't know
if she understands.
-That's bullshit.

21:26.869 --> 21:32.456
Look, darla was crying
right along with you when
y'all left ernestine's farm.

21:32.508 --> 21:35.009
Baby on her chest. Barely
healed from childbirth.

21:36.262 --> 21:37.261
Weeping her eyes out.

21:38.247 --> 21:39.880
But still holding you up.

21:39.915 --> 21:41.549
I'm supposed to be the one
holding her up.

21:41.584 --> 21:43.134
Nah.

21:43.186 --> 21:45.886
Nah, man, that ain't
how it go. Y'all supposed to
hold each other up.

21:47.557 --> 21:50.891
Look, I know that you,
you wanna take care
of your woman.

21:51.728 --> 21:52.610
Of your family.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.980
But you gotta understand,

21:56.032 --> 21:57.315
darla ain't one of these
little girls

21:57.367 --> 21:58.949
running around here
trying to get taken care of.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.569
She wants to be your partner.

22:02.689 --> 22:03.754
She wants to stand with you.

22:05.441 --> 22:10.411
You know I know all too well
