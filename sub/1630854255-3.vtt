WEBVTT

02:20.598 --> 02:23.017
House Velaryon is coming for you!

02:24.018 --> 02:26.437
The Sea Snake will have
your poxy fucking head!

02:27.397 --> 02:29.732
No, no, no. No, please!

02:36.739 --> 02:39.325
Fuck you, Prince Drahar!

02:39.409 --> 02:42.787
Fuck your whore mother and bastard father!

02:45.456 --> 02:47.709
No, no! No!

03:12.150 --> 03:13.985
Dragon!

03:13.985 --> 03:16.112
Hail Prince Daemon!

03:19.157 --> 03:22.243
Burn the fucking Triarchy cunts alive!

03:30.251 --> 03:31.419
Here, my Prince.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.297
Save me!

03:42.972 --> 03:44.432
To the caves! Now!

03:52.607 --> 03:54.233
Retreat to the caves!

04:17.215 --> 04:18.591
Where are you?

04:20.885 --> 04:23.221
Come out and face me, Drahar!

04:25.306 --> 04:27.016
Come out, Drahar!

04:28.059 --> 04:29.686
Where are you?

04:30.812 --> 04:33.231
I'm gonna feed you to your own crabs!

04:34.107 --> 04:35.566
Where are you?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.023
He has your hair, Your Grace.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.109
He does have my hair.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.319
- He has your eyes, Your Grace.
- Yes, he does.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.906
And you have my nose, don't you?

05:23.990 --> 05:28.161
Two years old and already our boy
has a kingly presence.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.370
He may yet, brother,

05:29.454 --> 05:31.372
but this morning he insisted on eating

05:31.456 --> 05:33.207
porridge with his hands.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.127
He will grow.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.298
We're quite a party
assembled in his honor.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.719
And surely by the end of this hunt,
we shall have more to celebrate.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.888
And what is that, pray tell.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.098
It is Aegon's second name day.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.767
His infancy's behind him.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.895
It only remains for Viserys to name him
heir to the throne.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.980
I wouldn't be so sure.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.607
He's the King's firstborn son.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.693
I don't know that His Grace
sees it so clearly.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.989
Then it lies with you
to make him see it...

06:05.740 --> 06:07.658
Lord Hand.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.660
Your Grace...

06:10.953 --> 06:12.705
I bring urgent news from the Stepstones.

06:13.956 --> 06:16.084
The Crabfeeder has dug in
for siege on Bloodstone

06:16.084 --> 06:18.669
while his men sabotage our fleet
under the cover of dark.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.129
Not today, Tyland.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.257
The matter of the Stepstones
is regrettably urgent.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.301
It's been three years.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.595
It can wait another three days.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.726
Come, eat.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.145
Fortify yourselves for the journey.

06:37.396 --> 06:38.439
Please.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.608
Is the baggage train ready?

06:40.608 --> 06:42.819
It is presently massing at the River Gate.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.655
Lord Jason expects us
in the Kingswood before midday.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.950
- Have you seen Rhaenyra?
- I have not, Your Grace.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.247
With the Triarchy now sheltering
in Bloodstone's caves,

06:54.247 --> 06:56.916
the threat of the dragons is blunted.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.543
They don't have foot soldiers.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.088
But their sellswords have been
withdrawing in droves, Your Grace.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.633
Even the mercenaries can see
that it is a losing effort.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.968
Where's Rhaenyra?

07:06.968 --> 07:09.011
I cannot be sure at present, Your Grace.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.223
The Velaryon forces have suffered
heavy attrition, Your Grace.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.810
The seeds of dissent are sown
amongst the rank and file.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.604
Daemon has driven the men hard.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.607
They have begun to question his command.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.694
If The Crown were ever to intervene...

07:24.694 --> 07:26.028
- Tyland--
- ...now is the time.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.364
Daemon and The Sea Snake started their war

07:28.364 --> 07:30.616
without His Grace's leave.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.202
Were he to intervene now after so long,

07:33.286 --> 07:35.204
it would make The Crown appear weak.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.914
Can someone tell me

07:36.998 --> 07:39.709
where in the Seven Hells
Rhaenyra might be?

07:39.709 --> 07:45.006
<i>Under the dragon's eye</i>

07:46.215 --> 07:51.304
<i>Under the dragon's eye</i>

07:52.013 --> 07:52.930
Again.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.434
Perhaps the Princess
might like to hear something else?

07:56.434 --> 07:58.436
She would not. Play it again.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.612
<i>She fled with her ships</i>

08:07.612 --> 08:10.531
<i>And her people</i>

08:10.615 --> 08:13.701
<i>Her heart broken for those</i>

08:14.785 --> 08:16.120
Your Grace.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.580
Did I say to stop?

08:22.543 --> 08:24.086
From the beginning.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.803
<i>She fled with her ships</i>

08:32.887 --> 08:35.765
- Rhaenyra?
- Yes, my Queen?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.684
Your presence is wanted
in the outer courtyard.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.062
The royal hunt readies to depart.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.898
I've decided to remain here
and read instead.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.443
You may go, Samwell.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.613
You are to stay by order of the Princess.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.450
The Queen commands you
to leave the Godswood at once.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.037
Princess.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.166
Your Grace.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.630
The King wishes for you to join us.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.173
The King has much to celebrate.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.549
He does not need me.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.176
He wants for us all to be together.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.305
Perhaps the hunt could be... fun.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.225
Is it the King's command?

09:20.351 --> 09:22.478
- Yes, but it--
- Then at once, Your Grace.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.647
But it needn't be.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.985
None of it needs be this way
in truth, Rhaenyra.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.787
Well, isn't this splendid.

09:39.787 --> 09:44.250
The whole of our family off to celebration
and adventure in the Kingswood.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.134
Should you be traveling in such condition?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.970
The maester said that being out in nature
would do me well.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.724
Well, you will be with your own child
sooner than late,

09:59.724 --> 10:01.809
and make me a proud grandsire.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.604
It's not so bad.

10:05.688 --> 10:09.025
The days are long, but Aegon
came quickly and without fuss.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.160
You should ride out with me today.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.287
Join in the chase.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.289
I'd rather not.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.293
The boars squeal like children
when they're being slaughtered.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.670
I find it discomforting.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.422
It's a hunt, Rhaenyra.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.802
How would you like to participate?

10:36.886 --> 10:38.095
I'm not sure why I must.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.348
Because you are my daughter...

10:40.348 --> 10:41.349
The Princess.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.226
And you have duties.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.312
As I am ceaselessly reminded.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.647
- I'm sorry?
- As I am ceaselessly reminded.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.984
You wouldn't need to be reminded
if you ever attended to them.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.986
No one's here for me.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.051
Hail, hail Aegon, the Conqueror-Babe,
Second of His Name!

12:00.177 --> 12:02.930
Here's to His Grace
on his second name day!

12:49.435 --> 12:52.396
Lady Johanna was reported
to have been abducted

12:52.480 --> 12:55.608
when one of Lord Swann's ships
sailed through the Stepstones.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.401
What will happen to Lady Johanna?

12:57.485 --> 13:00.321
She's to be sold to a pillow house
in the Free Cities

13:00.321 --> 13:02.323
if you believe the rumors.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.744
I fear the gods did not
make me for hunting.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.162
Might I sit with you, my ladies?

13:08.162 --> 13:09.997
But of course. Please join us.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.251
Larys Strong, the youngest son of our
Master of Law, Lord Lyonel.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.753
My Lord husband says that no King

13:15.753 --> 13:18.547
has even been able to tame
the Stepstones for long.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.675
It's an inhospitable place
suited only for savages.

13:21.759 --> 13:25.304
Perhaps the Princess...
can give us some insight.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.890
I'm not sure how I could.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.975
I've never been to the Stepstones.

13:30.059 --> 13:33.062
Your dear uncle is the great mind
behind this war.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.939
- Is he not?
- I wouldn't know.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.524
I've not spoken to Daemon in years.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.567
Since you supplanted him as heir.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.736
Daemon made his choices, Lady Ceira.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.113
The Princess was more suited to the role.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.326
He's made a mess
and the King must put an end to it.

13:47.326 --> 13:51.497
Send fleets and men
and clear out the Triarchy for good.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.333
But The Crown is not at war.

13:55.167 --> 13:58.254
The Crown... is at war, Princess.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.089
Though your father refuses to admit it,

14:00.089 --> 14:03.008
we've been dragged into it by your uncle
and The Sea Snake.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.595
And how have you served the realm of late,
Lady Redwyne, by eating cake?

14:39.753 --> 14:41.839
I wonder, Princess...

14:41.839 --> 14:44.466
was your own second name day
as grand as this?

14:45.217 --> 14:47.761
I honestly don't recall
and neither will Aegon.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.016
Lord Jason Lannister.

14:53.183 --> 14:55.436
I gathered that from all the lions.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.479
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.527
Your twin serves on my father's council.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.530
Tyland is...

15:06.614 --> 15:09.825
frightfully dull, gods love him.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.702
The finest honeyed wine you'll ever taste.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.330
- Made in Lannisport, of course.
- Of course.

15:16.123 --> 15:19.209
The Kingswood,
it's fine hunting ground.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.754
But the best spot is to be
found at Casterly Rock,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.589
near my home.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.965
Have you been?

15:25.049 --> 15:27.134
Once... on tour

15:27.134 --> 15:28.844
with my mother when I was young,

15:28.844 --> 15:31.555
and honestly can't recall
much of that either.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.433
The Rock is thrice the height
of the Hightower in Oldtown,

15:34.433 --> 15:36.477
taller still than the Wall in the north.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.936
It's been said that

15:38.020 --> 15:41.398
if one were to stand in the tower...
on a perfect day,

15:41.482 --> 15:44.276
one could see clear across the Sunset Sea.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.695
It must be quite something.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.948
I don't have a Dragonpit,
of course, but...

15:50.032 --> 15:52.576
I do have the means
and resources to build one.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.704
Why would you need a Dragonpit?

15:56.246 --> 15:58.207
To house dragons, of course.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.292
I'd do anything for my Queen...

16:01.335 --> 16:03.837
or... lady wife.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.844
Thank you for the wine.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.653
Is that what I am to you?

16:27.653 --> 16:30.280
A prize to proffer about
to the great houses?

16:35.119 --> 16:37.037
You're of age, Rhaenyra.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.873
And Jason Lannister is an excellent match.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.792
He's arrogant and self-serious.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.460
I thought you might have that in common.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.588
Since you came of age,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.924
I've been slowly drowning
in a lake of parchment

16:48.924 --> 16:50.884
flung from every corner of the realm.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.803
Marriage proposals, all.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.346
And I have tried often

16:54.430 --> 16:55.931
to discuss it with you,

16:55.931 --> 16:57.599
but you've refused me at every turn.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.643
That is because I do not
wish to get married.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.312
Even I do not exist above tradition
and duty, Rhaenyra!

17:02.396 --> 17:04.273
Excuse me, Your Grace.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.782
You must marry.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.662
- Yes?
- The royal huntsman

17:18.746 --> 17:19.872
have sent a report, Your Grace.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.958
There's been a sighting of a white hart.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.712
The stag is "The King of the Kingswood,"
Your Grace.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.590
A regal portent for
Prince Aegon's name day.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.405
Princess.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.330
Princess, wait!

18:21.225 --> 18:22.434
Princess, slow down!

18:32.069 --> 18:32.986
Princess!

18:35.864 --> 18:36.824
No!

18:38.909 --> 18:41.411
Whoa, whoa, now!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.547
What happened back there?

18:52.589 --> 18:54.842
My father...

18:54.842 --> 18:57.761
trying to sell me off to Jason Lannister.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.517
Was I named heir to the Iron Throne

19:03.517 --> 19:06.520
so that I might only
further raise the standing

19:06.520 --> 19:08.522
of a Lord of Casterly Rock?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.735
Do you want me to kill him?

19:20.117 --> 19:22.369
We should return to camp, Princess.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.999
It's a beautiful day.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.877
We should take in the Kingswood.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.260
Were you ever betrothed, Ser Criston?

19:38.260 --> 19:40.888
I had an adventurous youth when my father

19:40.888 --> 19:43.724
served at Blackhaven, to be sure.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.142
But my station was never high enough

19:45.142 --> 19:46.560
for a formal betrothal.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.271
Before I spoke my vows
as a knight of the Kingsguard,

19:49.271 --> 19:51.523
I could've married
a common-born girl had I wished.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.902
How lucky you are to have
a say in your own life.

19:54.902 --> 19:58.155
Many in the realm would
gladly trade positions with you, Princess.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.951
Only because none of them
has ever held my position.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.537
I may be the Princess of Dragonstone,

20:05.621 --> 20:07.122
but I am toothless.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.834
One day...

20:11.835 --> 20:13.879
not so long ago,

20:13.879 --> 20:17.633
you held enough power to write my name
into the White Book.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.301
And when your father
named me to his Kingsguard,

20:19.301 --> 20:21.929
it was the highest honor
any Cole have ever known.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.098
All that I have, I owe to you.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.187
Now I'd hardly call that
toothless, Princess.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.638
- Your Grace.
- How far?

21:04.638 --> 21:07.307
Her droppings were found
half a league to the east.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.107
- Still fresh.
- Between two and three hours, Your Grace.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.984
My best scouts spied him.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.319
The beast is upward of 35 stone.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.780
And we now have his trail.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.033
- Aye.
- Before the dragons ruled over Westeros,

21:25.117 --> 21:27.744
the white hart was a symbol of royalty
in these lands.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.289
And on this day of all days.

21:32.165 --> 21:35.002
I've never been one
for signs and portents, Your Grace,

21:35.002 --> 21:38.296
but if the gods did wish
to show their favor.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.132
Your Grace...

22:24.885 --> 22:28.680
I had this forged in the Golden Gallery
in honor of Prince Aegon.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.902
It's quite a thing.

22:43.361 --> 22:46.698
I hope it might provide the killing stroke
against your white hart.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.536
The King of the Kingswood.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.832
It's as if the Seven themselves
have blessed this day.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.294
Thank you for your generosity.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.757
I would be honored

23:04.925 --> 23:07.928
to take the Princess Rhaenyra
to wife, Your Grace.

23:09.304 --> 23:10.889
What I offer you,

23:10.889 --> 23:14.226
The Crown and your daughter,
is strength.

23:16.978 --> 23:21.108
Do you think that House Targaryen
wants for strength?

23:21.608 --> 23:24.486
If someone offered you more dragons,
would you not take them?

23:25.237 --> 23:27.781
Do you have dragons to offer?

23:30.325 --> 23:32.702
Casterly Rock is a splendid seat.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.997
Rhaenyra may take her place there
by my side without shame,

23:36.081 --> 23:39.042
and feel herself well-compensated
for her loss in station.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.711
What loss of station?

23:42.629 --> 23:46.049
If you were to name
young Aegon heir, Your Grace.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.051
And when would I be doing that?

23:49.511 --> 23:53.306
I had assumed--
as he's your firstborn son--

23:53.390 --> 23:56.226
- Many of us had assumed--
- Many of us, you say?

23:57.310 --> 23:59.896
Have your bannermen
questioned my choice of heir?

23:59.980 --> 24:01.189
Of course not, Your Grace.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.442
It is your sworn duty to report rebellion

24:03.442 --> 24:05.694
- stirring in my kingdom.
- Rebellion?

24:05.694 --> 24:08.363
There's been nothing
of the sort, Your Grace.

24:08.363 --> 24:12.409
I did not decide to name
Rhaenyra my heir on a whim.

24:13.743 --> 24:17.414
All the lords of the kingdom
would do well to remember that.

24:20.208 --> 24:23.128
Thank you... for the gift.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.549
Your Grace.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.180
Wine.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.863
The huntsman has the trail, Your Grace,
and has sent out the hounds.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.240
It won't be long now until
the white hart is cornered.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.868
Your prize is within reach.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.915
What do you make of Lord Jason's proposal?

25:00.582 --> 25:03.126
That man's pride has pride.

25:06.588 --> 25:10.133
You're not only Rhaenyra's father,
you're the King.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.427
She'll do as you command.

25:14.095 --> 25:17.390
It is not my wish to command her, Otto.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.601
I want her to be happy.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.276
There is another choice
beyond Casterly Rock.

25:29.569 --> 25:32.739
One, perhaps, you might be more
comfortable with.

25:32.739 --> 25:35.659
One... closer to home.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.286
Who do you have in mind?

25:41.790 --> 25:43.208
Prince Aegon.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.135
The boy just turned two, Otto.

25:54.219 --> 25:58.723
Yes, but it would cease
the endless proposals for Rhaenyra's hand.

26:00.642 --> 26:04.062
- Betroth them.
- I came here to hunt...

26:04.062 --> 26:08.066
not to be suffocated by
all this fucking politicking.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.278
Let us speak no more of it.

27:03.830 --> 27:07.167
We've sent out riders to find
Rhaenyra, Your Grace.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.462
Ser Criston went after her,
so the hope is that they are together.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.881
The girl is a heedless contrarian.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.926
If I instead forbade her
to wed a Lannister,

27:17.010 --> 27:20.138
she would've run off
with Lord Jason out of spite.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.267
A truly great Targaryen King I am.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.688
Powerless over mine own
daughter of seven-and-ten.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.150
King Jaehaerys ruled over
half a century of peace

27:32.150 --> 27:35.695
while his children drove him
to the edge of madness...

27:35.779 --> 27:37.989
his daughters, in particular.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.450
It is tradition, Your Grace.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.959
Do you wish to hear
my opinion on the matter?

27:54.381 --> 27:56.174
Should I guess?

27:58.259 --> 27:59.969
You believe that your son,

28:00.053 --> 28:02.555
Ser Harwin "Breakbones,"

28:02.639 --> 28:05.850
the strongest knight
in the Seven Kingdoms,

28:05.934 --> 28:08.228
is the best match for Rhaenyra.

28:09.979 --> 28:12.107
You flatter me, Your Grace, but no.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.360
It would seem to me
the best match for Rhaenyra

28:15.360 --> 28:17.070
is the son of The Sea Snake,

28:17.070 --> 28:18.363
Ser Laenor.

28:19.489 --> 28:22.659
Some years ago, I counseled you
to take his sister to wife.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.661
My reasoning remains the same.

28:25.703 --> 28:28.248
Laenor is of pure Valyrian descent.

28:29.165 --> 28:32.085
He shares blood with your cousin,
the Princess Rhaenys.

28:32.669 --> 28:36.005
And he is the heir to the wealthiest
house in the realm.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.218
The breach between your houses
has not narrowed since I last spoke of it.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.512
It would do much to assuage Lord Corlys

28:42.512 --> 28:45.473
of any slights real... or imagined.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.565
We must pray, of course,
that Laenor survives

28:53.565 --> 28:55.191
the fighting in the Stepstones.

29:34.189 --> 29:37.108
Princess, I must make a final plea
that we return to the camp.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.487
I rather prefer it here.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.700
His Grace is certain to be worried
by your absence.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.704
His Grace can worry
himself to death if he so likes.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.633
Tell me something, Ser Criston.

30:03.384 --> 30:06.304
Do you think the realm will
ever accept me as their Queen?

30:14.062 --> 30:16.606
They'll have no choice but to, Princess.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.641
Is everything all right, Your Grace?

32:18.519 --> 32:19.812
You know, I...

32:20.897 --> 32:25.026
I named her to protect
the realm from Daemon.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.280
She was my only child.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.992
"The Realm's Delight."

32:33.993 --> 32:35.912
I named her out of love

32:37.121 --> 32:39.332
because I no longer believed...

32:40.833 --> 32:42.502
Believed what, my love?

32:50.885 --> 32:53.805
Many in my line have been dragonriders.

32:55.973 --> 32:58.393
Very few among us have been dreamers.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.565
What is the power of a dragon...

33:05.441 --> 33:07.402
next to the power of prophecy.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.945
The hour is too late, husband.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.030
When Rhaenyra was a child...

33:12.115 --> 33:14.033
I saw it in a dream...

33:15.284 --> 33:17.620
as vivid as these flames, I saw it.

33:19.455 --> 33:22.375
A male babe born to me...

33:23.126 --> 33:25.044
wearing the Conqueror's crown.

33:25.712 --> 33:26.838
(sighs)

33:27.463 --> 33:30.049
And I so wanted it to be true,

33:30.133 --> 33:32.051
to be a dreamer myself.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.348
I sought that vision again,
night after night...

33:38.808 --> 33:40.727
but it never came again.

33:42.478 --> 33:45.398
I poured all my thought and will into it.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.403
And my obsession killed Rhaenyra's mother.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.113
Viserys.

33:53.364 --> 33:57.952
I thought Rhaenyra was the way
out of my abyss of grief and regret.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.623
And naming her heir would
begin to set things right.

34:02.707 --> 34:05.626
- It did.
- I never imagined I would remarry...

34:06.627 --> 34:08.212
that I would have a son.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.178
What if I was wrong?

35:16.823 --> 35:18.157
Left.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.876
He may not be white, Your Grace.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.961
But he's a big lad.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.471
Your Grace... for the kill.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.665
Right here, Your Grace.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.989
One more time, Your Grace.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.616
A little bit to your left.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.958
No.

39:36.999 --> 39:38.292
Come, sweet Prince.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.461
Let's give Her Grace some peace.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.019
Did you enjoy the hunt, Your Grace?

39:58.479 --> 40:01.857
- Well enough.
- How fared my grandson?

40:03.067 --> 40:05.653
The ladies Lannister and Redwyne
were quite taken with him.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.655
As they should be.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.574
He's the future of the realm.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.246
You yourself witnessed
the scale of the celebration,

40:15.246 --> 40:17.665
how it's united the men.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.083
When you bore the King a son,

40:19.083 --> 40:22.419
you ended 15 years
of uncertainty and doubt.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.797
Aegon, like his namesake,

40:24.797 --> 40:27.424
was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

40:27.925 --> 40:31.846
If Viserys were to name him heir,
the realm would fete him for it.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.353
And does this not please you?

40:40.104 --> 40:43.649
- Do you not want your son to be King?
- And what mother wouldn't?

40:44.650 --> 40:46.610
You mustn't ignore the certain truth

40:46.694 --> 40:49.822
that if Rhaenyra were to step over Aegon
to ascend the throne,

40:49.822 --> 40:52.032
the realm would tear itself apart.

40:54.201 --> 40:57.413
They all swore obeisance to her,
our house among them.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.415
That was before Aegon.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.585
Rhaenyra will be a good queen.

41:02.585 --> 41:07.006
It wouldn't matter if she were
Jaehaerys himself born again.

41:08.716 --> 41:11.719
- Rhaenyra is a woman.
- What of my son?

41:11.719 --> 41:14.638
Would you have me raise a man to steal his
own sister's birthright?

41:14.722 --> 41:17.641
It is Aegon that's being robbed.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.685
He's the firstborn son of the King.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.854
To deny that he is heir to the throne

41:21.854 --> 41:24.356
is to assail the laws of gods and men.

41:26.525 --> 41:30.487
The road ahead is uncertain,
but the end is clear.

41:30.571 --> 41:32.489
Aegon will be king.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.328
You must guide Viserys towards reason.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.665
<i>He'll never find it on his own.</i>

41:49.673 --> 41:51.258
How are you feeling, husband?

41:51.342 --> 41:54.303
The gods have punished me
for my indulgences.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.639
At least the wine was good.

41:56.639 --> 41:57.848
Too good.

42:10.277 --> 42:12.404
I was hoping we might discuss something.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.742
Rhaenyra?

42:20.913 --> 42:23.249
I do not think she enjoyed
Jason Lannister's company.

42:24.541 --> 42:26.752
She is cross.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.712
I warned you that she would be.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.756
Rhaenyra has come of age.

42:30.756 --> 42:33.676
She must needs marry a high lord
who will honor her, defend her,

42:33.676 --> 42:35.552
and serve her as king consort.

42:36.220 --> 42:39.014
Her wishes in this matter are irrelevant.

42:39.098 --> 42:42.768
I do believe that Rhaenyra
will marry, Your Grace.

42:42.768 --> 42:45.938
But she must believe
it is her choice to do so.

42:54.571 --> 42:56.907
- What's this?
- A letter...

42:59.034 --> 43:00.953
from Vaemond Velaryon.

43:01.495 --> 43:04.039
- The Sea Snake's brother.
- Yeah.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.376
He's fighting in the Stepstones,

43:07.376 --> 43:09.003
with all the rest of them.

43:14.717 --> 43:15.509
May I?

43:26.520 --> 43:29.064
Lord Corlys and Prince Daemon
are losing their war.

43:29.773 --> 43:31.900
Badly, by all accounts.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.653
This is a plea for aid.

43:37.156 --> 43:39.158
Then why not send it?

43:39.158 --> 43:42.411
Because it is a war
started by two malcontents,

43:42.411 --> 43:44.621
unhappy with decisions I made.

43:46.081 --> 43:49.251
If I now provide Daemon and Corlys succor,

43:49.335 --> 43:50.794
what will that say of their king?

43:50.878 --> 43:53.589
Perhaps, that he is a good man who
loves his brother.

43:53.589 --> 43:56.967
Well, if you truly
believe that, my dear...

43:57.051 --> 43:59.178
then you possess a generous spirit.

44:00.763 --> 44:03.098
What do you believe, Viserys?

44:06.435 --> 44:08.604
That I am forever doomed
to anger one person

44:08.604 --> 44:10.230
in the pleasing of another.

44:11.023 --> 44:12.941
Then I pose a simpler question.

44:14.109 --> 44:17.154
Is it better for the realm
if the Crabfeeder thrives,

44:17.154 --> 44:18.781
or is vanquished?

44:25.621 --> 44:27.623
Make haste to Dwarfstone, Ser Addam.

44:27.623 --> 44:30.042
Hand-deliver this
to Prince Daemon yourself.

44:30.042 --> 44:31.668
At once, Your Grace.

44:40.219 --> 44:43.138
- Dwarfstone?
- I'm sending word to Daemon.

44:43.722 --> 44:46.141
Aid is sailing to the Stepstones.

44:47.184 --> 44:50.979
- Did he make call for help?
- He would sooner die.

44:51.063 --> 44:53.232
But his king does not mean to allow that.

44:57.903 --> 45:00.114
Do you not think my decision correct?

45:00.114 --> 45:02.699
It is no consequence to what I think...

45:02.783 --> 45:04.660
as I'm often reminded.

45:07.162 --> 45:09.706
Daemon is thorn enough in my flesh.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.418
Will you insist on taking after him?

45:13.836 --> 45:15.504
Must everything be a battle?

45:15.504 --> 45:18.841
If you refer to your attempt
to marry me off to Casterly Rock.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.969
I am sorry, Rhaenyra.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.431
I was trying to help you.

45:25.431 --> 45:26.682
Will you not be helped?

45:27.891 --> 45:31.270
Why must every effort
on your behalf be resisted

45:31.270 --> 45:34.273
- as if to the death?
- Because you mean to replace me...

45:35.190 --> 45:37.484
with Alicent Hightower's son,

45:37.568 --> 45:39.945
the boy you always wanted.

45:40.654 --> 45:42.322
You have him in hands now.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.950
You have no further use for me.

45:44.950 --> 45:47.327
You might as well peddle me
for what you can.

45:47.411 --> 45:50.956
A mountain stronghold or a fleet of ships.

45:50.956 --> 45:53.083
You have misjudged me, Rhaenyra.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.960
All know it.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.129
Jason Lannister knows it.

45:57.129 --> 45:58.714
You said it yourself,

45:58.714 --> 46:01.633
the lords of the realm
gather like vultures to a carcass,

46:01.717 --> 46:03.719
hoping to feast on my bones.

46:06.513 --> 46:10.392
It is true that as rulers
we must marry for advantage

46:10.476 --> 46:13.562
to forge alliances
and bolster our strength.

46:13.562 --> 46:16.106
You have always understood this.

46:16.607 --> 46:19.193
I myself was promised
to your mother when I was--

46:19.193 --> 46:20.944
Ten-and-seven years of age.

46:21.028 --> 46:23.030
The Vale had an army to rival the North.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.657
I've heard that story
since I've had ears to.

46:26.950 --> 46:28.869
I loved her.

46:29.578 --> 46:30.996
She made a man of me.

46:34.708 --> 46:36.960
I do not seek to replace you, child.

46:38.587 --> 46:40.839
You've been much alone
these last few years.

46:40.923 --> 46:42.841
Alone and angry.

46:44.426 --> 46:46.136
I will not live forever.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.222
I wish to see you contented,

46:48.222 --> 46:49.806
happy even.

46:49.890 --> 46:51.141
You think a man will do it?

46:51.225 --> 46:53.268
- A family.
- I had a family.

46:53.352 --> 46:54.895
What would you have me do?!

46:54.895 --> 46:57.814
If it was for advantage, you would've wed
Laena Velaryon!

47:02.903 --> 47:04.446
That is true enough.

47:07.199 --> 47:09.326
You must marry,

47:10.035 --> 47:12.663
strengthen your own claim,

47:12.663 --> 47:14.957
shore up your succession,

47:14.957 --> 47:16.375
multiply.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.503
As to your match...

47:21.296 --> 47:22.673
make it yourself.

47:23.757 --> 47:25.509
Search him out.

47:25.509 --> 47:29.179
Find one that pleases you, as I did.

47:44.736 --> 47:45.862
Rhaenyra...

47:51.952 --> 47:54.705
I did waver at one time.

47:56.415 --> 47:59.751
But I swear to you now,
on your mother's memory,

48:00.919 --> 48:02.838
you will not be supplanted.

48:46.465 --> 48:49.718
<i>We have 16, perhaps 18, seaworthy ships.</i>

48:49.718 --> 48:52.054
<i>Seven hundred foot, some 60 knights.</i>

48:52.054 --> 48:55.891
<i>Our food quickly dwindles,
save for what we can fish from the sea.</i>

48:55.891 --> 48:57.309
<i>I would say we have a fortnight,</i>

48:57.309 --> 49:00.103
<i>mayhaps a bit longer
with strict rationing.</i>

49:00.187 --> 49:02.189
<i>I've made call for Driftmark
to send more ships,</i>

49:02.189 --> 49:04.858
<i>but they will be weeks away.</i>

49:04.942 --> 49:07.694
<i>We are faltering
and the Triarchy knows it.</i>

49:07.778 --> 49:11.281
<i>We must press the attack,
continue sending the dragons.</i>

49:11.365 --> 49:13.825
It's pointless, father.

49:13.909 --> 49:16.328
The Crabfeeder has
created a chokepoint here,

49:16.328 --> 49:18.080
beyond these dunes.

49:18.580 --> 49:19.956
Archers hold the high positions,

49:20.040 --> 49:21.708
foot soldiers hold the ground.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.960
We've strafed them on
dragonback again and again,

49:24.044 --> 49:26.171
but they just retreat within the caves.

49:26.171 --> 49:30.092
Dragons can circle Bloodstone
until they fall out of the sky.

49:30.092 --> 49:31.426
The Crabfeeder and his men

49:31.510 --> 49:33.261
have no reason to leave those caves.

49:33.345 --> 49:35.222
We must give them one,

49:35.222 --> 49:38.183
an offering of flesh to bait the crab.

49:38.183 --> 49:39.643
Who?

49:39.643 --> 49:41.603
Dragon returning!

49:49.027 --> 49:50.529
Yes. Who?

49:50.529 --> 49:53.115
Which man here will
happily go to his death?

49:53.115 --> 49:55.075
Show me the knight who
will march into that hell pit,

49:55.075 --> 49:56.910
nephew, and I will show you a madman.

49:56.910 --> 49:59.579
- Daemon.
- Daemon is why we are losing!

49:59.663 --> 50:02.332
He at least is fighting this war.

50:02.416 --> 50:05.085
What role have you played
in his council, uncle,

50:05.085 --> 50:06.920
- other than Master of Complaints?
- Enough, Laenor.

50:06.920 --> 50:09.881
If King's Landing will not support Daemon,

50:09.965 --> 50:11.633
why should any of us?

50:17.973 --> 50:21.977
Blood or no, Vaemond,
I will not have you stoke mutiny.

50:43.540 --> 50:45.959
If you do not seize control
of this war, my lord,

50:45.959 --> 50:48.795
the crabs will soon dine on all of us.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.271
Prince Daemon.

51:06.271 --> 51:09.149
I bring word from His Grace,
Viserys Targaryen,

51:09.149 --> 51:10.984
first of his name, King of the Andals,

51:10.984 --> 51:12.944
the Rhoynar, and the First Men,

51:13.028 --> 51:15.947
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm.

51:58.824 --> 52:02.410
That's enough! Stop!

52:17.634 --> 52:19.219
<i>Brother...</i>

52:19.219 --> 52:21.179
<i>I have ordered 10 ships</i>

52:21.263 --> 52:24.307
<i>and 2,000 men to set sail
from King's Landing</i>

52:24.391 --> 52:26.518
<i>to join the effort in the Stepstones.</i>

52:28.061 --> 52:31.690
<i>Though time and circumstance
have seen us estranged,</i>

52:31.690 --> 52:36.236
<i>know that it is not my desire to see you
fail in your cause.</i>

52:36.236 --> 52:38.947
<i>It is instead my hope
that this aid will deliver</i>

52:38.947 --> 52:40.907
<i>the victory that has thus far evaded us.</i>

52:44.077 --> 52:47.455
<i>I shall pray nightly to
the gods for your safe return.</i>

54:41.069 --> 54:41.987
Nock.

55:06.720 --> 55:07.887
Draw.

55:47.844 --> 55:48.762
Loose!

55:57.353 --> 55:58.480
Loose!

56:14.287 --> 56:15.246
Loose!

56:34.516 --> 56:35.850
Loose!

59:16.928 --> 59:18.346
<i>Dracarys!</i>

59:34.404 --> 59:35.947
Dragon!

1:00:56.152 --> 1:00:57.236
<i>Dracarys!</i>
