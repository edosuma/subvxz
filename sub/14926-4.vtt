WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:07.108
FORGIVE ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.008
IT'S BEEN...

00:08.042 --> 00:10.644
OH, A LONG TIME
SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION.

00:10.678 --> 00:11.445
Father:
HOW LONG?

00:11.479 --> 00:14.415
WOULD YOU BE MAD
IF I SAID 10 YEARS?

00:14.448 --> 00:15.683
OF COURSE NOT.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.186
GOOD, 'CAUSE
IT'S BEEN 15.

00:18.819 --> 00:19.787
OOH.

00:19.820 --> 00:20.488
SEE, I GOT MY GIRLFRIEND
PREGNANT IN HIGH SCHOOL,

00:20.521 --> 00:22.290
AND I KNOW
THAT'S YOUR CLASSIC

00:22.323 --> 00:22.956
CONFESSION SITUATION,

00:22.990 --> 00:24.192
BUT THEN
THINGS GOT SO CRAZY.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.260
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
WITH KIDS, AND--

00:26.294 --> 00:29.297
OK, PROBABLY
YOU DON'T.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.531
WHAT ARE
YOU CONFESSING?

00:30.564 --> 00:33.067
OK, I'M NOT SO MUCH
CONFESSING AS COMPLAINING.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.469
YOU KNOW SISTER--
SISTER HELEN?

00:35.503 --> 00:37.471
YOU KNOW, THE PRINCIPAL
OVER AT THE SCHOOL?

00:37.505 --> 00:41.475
WELL, I NEED AN ALLY
TO HELP ME DEFEAT HER.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.844
WE GENERALLY DON'T
TRY TO DEFEAT NUNS.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.580
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE OF HER
THAT MY DAUGHTER

00:46.614 --> 00:47.748
CAN'T EVEN GO
TO SCHOOL ANYMORE.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.083
I MEAN, SHE HAS IT OUT
FOR ALL MY KIDS,

00:49.117 --> 00:50.118
AND THEY'RE NOT BAD KIDS.

00:50.151 --> 00:53.087
I MEAN, NOT LIKE I WAS
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL THERE.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.088
YOU KNOW,

00:54.122 --> 00:55.556
ONE TIME, FATHER,

00:55.589 --> 00:56.790
ME AND
THIS BUDDY OF MINE,

00:56.824 --> 01:00.161
WE LET A GOAT LOOSE
DURING MIDNIGHT MASS.

01:01.629 --> 01:02.630
SEAN?

01:02.663 --> 01:05.599
HUH? UH, NO, NO.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.201
SEAN?

01:07.235 --> 01:09.270
SEAN FINNERTY?

01:09.303 --> 01:10.771
TIM?

01:10.804 --> 01:11.872
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

01:11.905 --> 01:12.873
OH, MY GOD.
REMEMBER?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.342
WE WERE STANDING
IN THE BACK
AND WE WERE LIKE,

01:14.375 --> 01:16.110
* DOO DOO DOO
AND THE GOAT WENT DOWN

01:16.144 --> 01:18.412
AND FATHER O'BRIEN
TURNED AROUND AND HE WENT

01:18.446 --> 01:19.647
MAAAH!

01:19.680 --> 01:20.681
MAAAH!

01:20.714 --> 01:21.715
I CAN'T

01:21.749 --> 01:24.418
COME ON, YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO THOUGHT OF THE GOAT.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.419
YEAH.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.053
MAAAH!

01:26.086 --> 01:29.257
OK, LET'S STOP
DOING THAT.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.275
HEY, LIL.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.075
HI.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.410
WHY ARE YOU IN
YOUR PAJAMAS ALREADY?

01:49.443 --> 01:52.246
YOU MEAN, WHY AM I
IN MY PAJAMAS STILL?

01:52.280 --> 01:53.747
YOU DIDN'T
GO TO SCHOOL?

01:53.781 --> 01:55.683
I'M NEVER GOING
TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.617
I'M GONNA SIT
ON THIS COUCH

01:56.650 --> 01:59.787
AND EAT HOT POCKETS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.390
LIKE AUNT MAUREEN.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.593
AUNT MAUREEN WOULD
NEVER FIT ON THAT COUCH.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.661
TOMORROW I'M GOING
TO THE ANIMAL SHELTER

02:07.695 --> 02:10.698
AND GETTING
A WHOLE BUNCH OF CATS.

02:10.731 --> 02:11.432
NO.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.065
TOMORROW, YOU'RE
GOING TO SCHOOL.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.368
I CAN'T GO BACK
TO SCHOOL.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.369
I'M DESPISED.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.270
ALL MY FRIENDS HATE ME.

02:16.304 --> 02:20.441
WELL, SCHOOL IS NOT
A POPULARITY CONTEST.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.743
YES, IT IS.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.745
I KNOW.

02:24.778 --> 02:25.479
YOU JUST, WHAT,

02:25.513 --> 02:26.947
SAT AROUND DOING
NOTHING ALL DAY?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.949
NO. I GOT
AN EXTENSION CORD

02:28.982 --> 02:30.451
SO I COULD MOVE
THE MICROWAVE

02:30.484 --> 02:31.652
NEXT TO THE COUCH.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.889
AH, MY ONLY FRIEND
IS CALLING ME.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.625
UH-UH.
GET ALL THIS STUFF

02:37.658 --> 02:38.692
BACK UP TO YOUR ROOM.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.529
NOT THE MICROWAVE.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.234
GROSS.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.268
HEY, CLAUD,
CLAUD, CLAUD!

02:47.301 --> 02:49.737
GUESS WHO THE CAT
DRAGGED IN!

02:49.770 --> 02:51.672
TIMMY SHEEHAN?

02:51.705 --> 02:52.873
OH, MY GOD!

02:52.906 --> 02:56.310
LOOK AT YOU,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

02:56.344 --> 02:58.579
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING?

02:58.612 --> 02:59.913
I'M A PRIEST.

02:59.947 --> 03:03.451
THE HELL
YOU ARE!

03:03.884 --> 03:04.685
WOW.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.653
LET ME GET THAT.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.356
HOW COME NOBODY
EVER BELIEVES
I'M A PRIEST?

03:08.389 --> 03:11.925
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
ALWAYS ACT
VERY PRIESTLY.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.794
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.829
HEY, HEY, TIM, COME ON.
RELAX. SIT DOWN.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.699
TIM HERE IS GONNA
HELP ME GET EVEN

03:18.732 --> 03:20.234
WITH SISTER HELEN.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.470
UM, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU PHRASE IT
LIKE THAT, SEAN,

03:22.503 --> 03:24.505
IT KINDA MAKES ME
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.973
OH, MAN, WE'RE
GONNA SMITE HER!

03:26.006 --> 03:26.874
OK, STOP.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.343
LOOK, TIM, YOU'RE
GONNA BE SO ON OUR SIDE

03:29.377 --> 03:30.844
WHEN YOU HEAR
WHAT HAPPENED.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.881
LILY, OUR DAUGHTER,
SHE HAD A PROBLEM
AT SCHOOL.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.617
INCOMING, BABE.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.619
HELLO.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.988
AREN'T YOU
GOING TO ASK ME
WHY I'M LATE?

03:41.021 --> 03:41.889
ARE YOU LATE?

03:41.922 --> 03:44.592
I HAD DETENTION,
THANK YOU.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.493
OH, MAN!

03:45.526 --> 03:48.596
GOD, NOT ANOTHER MEETING
WITH SISTER HELEN.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.930
ANOTHER MEETING?

03:49.963 --> 03:53.434
WE TEND TO HAVE
A LOT OF MEETINGS
WITH SISTER HELEN.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.769
WE'D JUST BEEN THERE
ON ACCOUNT OF JIMMY.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.806
JIMMY HAS BEEN
EXTREMELY DISRUPTIVE
IN CLASS,

03:58.839 --> 04:00.808
AND WE'RE ALL
A BIT CONCERNED.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.910
WELL, HE'S BEEN
JUST FINE AT HOME.

04:02.943 --> 04:03.877
YEAH,
TOTALLY NORMAL.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.714
JIMMY, TELL THEM
WHAT YOU TOLD
YOUR TEACHER.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.284
I'M POSSESSED BY SATAN!

04:12.753 --> 04:13.821
POSSESSED BY SATAN?

04:13.854 --> 04:15.756
WELL,
HE'S NOT REALLY.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.890
GOOD TO KNOW.

04:16.924 --> 04:17.891
JIMMY'S
NOT THE PROBLEM.

04:17.925 --> 04:21.595
THE PROBLEM
IS SISTER HELEN'S
OUT TO GET LILY,

04:21.629 --> 04:23.497
AND I JUST
NEEDED THE PROOF.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.499
SHE SAID
MY SKIRT'S
TOO SHORT.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.702
WELL, IS YOUR SKIRT
TOO SHORT?
YES!

04:28.736 --> 04:29.337
WELL?

04:29.370 --> 04:30.304
EVERYBODY'S
SKIRT'S SHORT.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.873
IF I WORE IT
THEIR WAY, I'D
BE A TOTAL FREAK.

04:32.906 --> 04:33.841
IT'S ALWAYS
THE SKIRT!

04:33.874 --> 04:35.809
DON'T THOSE NUNS
HAVE ANYTHING
BETTER TO DO?

04:35.843 --> 04:37.978
WAIT A MINUTE.
IF EVERYBODY'S SKIRT
WAS TOO SHORT,

04:38.011 --> 04:39.179
WHY IS SHE
SINGLING YOU OUT?

04:39.212 --> 04:43.584
BECAUSE I'M NOT
ONE OF HER LITTLE
GOODY-GOODY PRINCESSES.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.319
LILY.

04:46.053 --> 04:49.723
I SEE THAT YOU
HAVEN'T VOLUNTEERED
FOR THE WALK-A-THON.

04:49.757 --> 04:50.658
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.660
WELL, YOU KNOW
WE'RE GOING
TO USE THE MONEY

04:52.693 --> 04:53.761
TO BUY A STATUE
OF SAINT FINIAN,

04:53.794 --> 04:56.764
SO I WAS JUST
WONDERING WHY YOU
HADN'T VOLUNTEERED.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.932
TCH. UM,
IT'S VOLUNTARY.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.670
WELL, YES, BUT WE'RE
STRONGLY ENCOURAGING
FULL PARTICIPATION.

05:02.703 --> 05:06.840
SO THE VOLUNTARY
WALK-A-THON
IS MANDATORY?

05:06.874 --> 05:08.008
HA HA.
OF COURSE NOT.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.612
WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU
TO DO ANYTHING YOU
DON'T WANT TO DO.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.782
WE'RE
JUST URGING YOU
TO WANT TO DO THIS.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.686
AND I'D REALLY
LIKE TO WANT TO.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.854
I JUST DON'T.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.557
YOU CAN'T TALK
TO A NUN LIKE THAT.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.059
COME ON, WHY NOT?
THEY'RE PEOPLE JUST
LIKE YOU AND ME.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.795
OK, THEY'RE
NOTHING LIKE YOU.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.530
YEAH, I'D LIKE
A CAR STEREO,

05:29.563 --> 05:31.665
BUT 40 BUCKS,
HOW GOOD COULD IT BE?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.901
WELL, THIS GUY
DOESN'T HAVE
A STORE.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.869
HE PASSES
THE SAVINGS
ON TO YOU.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.838
GUYS, GUYS. COME ON,
COME ON, GUYS.
WE HAVE COMPANY.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.908
TIM, YOU REMEMBER
MY DAD AND
MY BROTHER EDDIE?

05:40.941 --> 05:43.477
TIMMY SHEEHAN,
A MAN OF
THE CLOTH!

05:43.511 --> 05:44.845
HEY, TIMMY.
HOW YOU DOING?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.914
WHAT, ARE YOU HERE
TO SEE CLAUDIA?

05:46.947 --> 05:47.881
NO!

05:47.915 --> 05:50.384
DIDN'T YOU GUYS
HAVE A THING
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

05:50.418 --> 05:52.853
I SEEM TO RECALL
THE THING.
IT WASN'T A THING.

05:52.886 --> 05:53.921
IT WAS
A HOT THING.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.656
YOU HAD A THING
WITH A PRIEST?

05:55.689 --> 05:58.792
IT WASN'T A THING
AND HE WASN'T
A PRIEST!

06:00.861 --> 06:01.962
A PRIEST!

06:01.995 --> 06:02.696
I KNEW IT.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.533
BUT YOU SAID
I WASN'T POSSESSED!

06:05.566 --> 06:07.000
YOU'RE NOT.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.602
BUT WHY IS A PRIEST HERE?

06:08.636 --> 06:10.804
JIMMY,
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND
OF OURS--TIMMY.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.073
YOU GUYS JUST
GO UPSTAIRS. GO.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.442
I CAN'T BE ALONE.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.144
THAT'S WHEN THE DEMONS
TELL ME TO DO THINGS.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.613
OK. COME ON,
GO. GO.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.015
SO WHY
DON'T YOU TELL
THE GOOD FATHER

06:22.049 --> 06:24.518
WHY YOUR SON'S
IMAGINARY FRIEND

06:24.552 --> 06:25.453
IS NAMED
BEELZEBUB?

06:25.486 --> 06:28.088
DAD, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
HENRY, THE LITTLE GUY,

06:28.121 --> 06:29.857
HE WANTED
TO GO TO THAT MOVIE

06:29.890 --> 06:32.626
WHERE THERE'S A PONY
WHO THINKS HE'S A BIRD.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.694
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.964
I'M GONNA KILL YOU,
AND THEN I'M GONNA
KILL MYSELF.

06:36.997 --> 06:37.865
Pony: HERE I GO!

06:37.898 --> 06:41.469
Bird:
BUT YOUR FEATHERS
ARE MADE OF HAY!

06:41.502 --> 06:42.202
MAGIC HAY!

06:42.235 --> 06:44.505
I WISH I HAD
SOME MAGIC HAY.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.440
I'LL NEVER BE A BIRD!

06:46.474 --> 06:48.108
DO YOU LIKE
THIS MOVIE?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.678
OH, YEAH.
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.079
HA HA HA HA!

06:52.112 --> 06:53.914
I THINK
IT SUCKS.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.883
THANK GOD. LET'S GO.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.117
SO WHERE
ARE WE GOING?

06:57.150 --> 06:59.687
LET'S SNEAK INTO
THE MOVIE NEXT DOOR.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.888
WHAT WAS THE MOVIE
NEXT DOOR?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.457
THE EXORCIST.

07:03.491 --> 07:10.097
Deep voice growling:
OOOOOOHHH.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.500
Henry: WOW!

07:12.533 --> 07:15.202
HER HEAD GOES
ALL THE WAY AROUND...

07:15.235 --> 07:16.970
LIKE AN OWL!

07:17.004 --> 07:18.939
LOOK! SHE CAN FLY!

07:18.972 --> 07:21.675
UNLIKE
THAT STUPID PONY.

07:25.613 --> 07:29.149
DO YOU AND EDDIE
EVER THINK
BEFORE YOU ACT?

07:29.182 --> 07:33.020
WE WERE ONLY
AT THE MOVIE FOR
ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR.

07:33.053 --> 07:36.089
CAN WE AT LEAST
TURN OFF THE LIGHT?

07:36.123 --> 07:37.658
NO!

07:38.992 --> 07:42.663
ARE WE SURE
HE ISN'T POSSESSED?

07:44.064 --> 07:45.065
YES.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.001
BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
IT GETS COLD IN HERE

07:48.035 --> 07:50.037
FOR NO REASON.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.072
I TURN
THE THERMOSTAT
DOWN.

07:52.105 --> 07:55.142
BUT WHO'S
MAKING YOU DO IT?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.178
LILY.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.548
HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE RESPECT
FOR THE GOOD FATHER?

08:00.581 --> 08:01.915
HOT POCKET, FATHER?

08:01.949 --> 08:04.217
FATHER TIM IS AN OLD
FRIEND OF THE FAMILY'S.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.287
HE KNEW YOU WHEN
YOU WERE JUST A BULGE

08:07.320 --> 08:08.288
IN YOUR MOTHER'S
GRADUATION DRESS.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.824
IF YOU'RE HERE
TO GET ME TO GO
BACK TO SCHOOL,

08:10.858 --> 08:14.094
YOU'D BETTER ACT FAST,
'CAUSE IN A COUPLE
OF WEEKS,

08:14.127 --> 08:16.196
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE DOWN A WALL

08:16.229 --> 08:19.700
AND USE A FORKLIFT
TO GET ME OUT
OF THIS HOUSE.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.101
OH, MAN.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.035
DID I NOT TELL YOU?

08:22.069 --> 08:24.905
SISTER HELEN HAS DONE
THIS TO MY BABY GIRL.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.907
DON'T LIE
TO A PRIEST, HONEY.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.009
THE HEM OF THE SKIRT
MAY FALL AS MANY AS

08:29.042 --> 08:31.311
BUT NO MORE THAN
2 INCHES ABOVE
THE KNEE,

08:31.344 --> 08:33.246
PROVIDED THAT IN
THE SEATED POSITION

08:33.280 --> 08:36.850
THE HEM RISES NO MORE
THAN ONE ADDITIONAL INCH
FROM THAT POINT.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.953
YOUR DAUGHTER SEEMS
TO HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.655
YES. BUT
LET ME ASSURE YOU,

08:41.689 --> 08:44.091
WE ARE TAKING STEPS
TO REMEDY THE SITUATION.

08:44.124 --> 08:49.129
WELL, I JUST HOPE
THESE STEPS INCLUDE
BUYING A LONGER SKIRT.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.632
OK. TIME TO LEAVE.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.700
WHAT IS IT?

08:52.733 --> 08:55.035
WHY DO YOU HAVE IT
OUT FOR ME AND
MY ENTIRE FAMILY?

08:55.068 --> 08:55.869
SEAN--

08:55.903 --> 08:58.606
I DON'T. I TREAT
ALL STUDENTS EQUALLY.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.040
AND BY THE WAY,

09:00.073 --> 09:02.676
I WOULD
HAVE IT IN FOR
YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.

09:02.710 --> 09:03.510
EXCUSE ME?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.245
YOU SAID I HAVE IT
OUT FOR YOUR FAMILY.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.780
THE CORRECT USAGE
IS IN.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.582
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S OUT.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.317
OUT, AS IN YOU'RE
OUT TO GET ME.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.686
YOU WOULDN'T SAY
YOU'RE IN TO GET ME.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.123
MR. FINNERTY,
YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO ARGUE SEMANTICS.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.192
I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR IT,
BUT I'M STAYING FOR IT.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.293
WELL, I CAN ASSURE YOU

09:20.327 --> 09:23.330
THAT I DON'T HAVE IT IN
OR OUT FOR LILY.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.898
HER SKIRT
WAS SIMPLY TOO SHORT.

09:24.932 --> 09:28.669
OH, GOD, WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU NUNS
AND YOUR SKIRTS?

09:28.702 --> 09:29.870
MRS. FINNERTY--

09:29.903 --> 09:31.739
GUESS WHAT, LADY.
WOMEN HAVE LEGS.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.974
I HAVE LEGS.
GET USED TO IT!

09:34.007 --> 09:36.744
YES, I CAN SEE
YOUR LEGS.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.612
MM-HMM. AND
I HAVE GREAT LEGS.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.815
AND YOU CAN'T KEEP ME
FROM SHOWING 'EM.
HA HA! LOOK!

09:41.849 --> 09:43.951
LOOK AT MY LEGS!

09:44.284 --> 09:47.154
I HAVE OTHER MATTERS
TO ATTEND TO.
GOOD EVENING.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.689
WRONG AGAIN!
IT'S GOOD
AFTERNOON!

09:48.722 --> 09:51.291
EVENING
STARTS AT 6:00!
HA HA HA!

09:51.324 --> 09:52.292
BURN! OW!

09:52.325 --> 09:55.295
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
LILY'S SKIRT WAS TOO SHORT.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.229
IT'S NOT THAT SHORT.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.131
THE BOYS WERE LOOKING
AT HER WITH THOUGHTS!

09:58.165 --> 10:00.133
HER SKIRTS ARE NO SHORTER
THAN MINE WERE.

10:00.167 --> 10:05.739
OH, YEAH.
AND YOU GRADUATED
MAGNA CUM BABY.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.409
I THOUGHT
YOU LOOKED TERRIFIC
IN THOSE SKIRTS.

10:10.678 --> 10:11.511
THANKS.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.815
STILL DREAMING
OF THE ONE
THAT GOT AWAY,

10:14.848 --> 10:16.717
HEY, PADRE?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.418
COME ON! WE WENT
ON A COUPLE
OF DATES!

10:18.451 --> 10:22.422
I'M SURE YOU DATED
LOTS OF GIRLS
AFTER ME, RIGHT?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.992
ACTUALLY, NO.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.861
YOU WERE MY LAST.

10:28.361 --> 10:32.232
YOU DROVE HIM
TO CELIBACY!

10:33.266 --> 10:36.269
CAN WE JUST TRY
TO STAY ON TOPIC
HERE, PLEASE?

10:36.303 --> 10:37.805
YES, PLEASE.
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.439
YOU BOUGHT LILY
A LONGER SKIRT, AND--

10:39.472 --> 10:43.076
NO, NO.
SISTER HELEN WAS OUT
TO GET MY FAMILY,

10:43.110 --> 10:46.146
AND I JUST
HAD TO GET PROOF.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.081
OH, YEAH.
THAT ONE RIGHT THERE.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.283
HER SKIRT IS MUCH
SHORTER THAN LILY'S.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.185
I'M ON IT.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.186
COME ON.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.254
HOLD ON.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.423
COME ON, COME ON!

10:57.357 --> 10:59.326
ARE YOU FINISHED?
COME ON!

10:59.359 --> 11:01.028
THERE WAS DUST!

11:01.061 --> 11:02.262
WHERE'D SHE GO?

11:02.295 --> 11:04.464
SHE GRADUATED.
GOD--RIGHT THERE,
RIGHT THERE,

11:04.497 --> 11:07.200
BY THE WATER FOUNTAIN.
PERFECT, PERFECT,
PERFECT!

11:07.234 --> 11:07.968
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.038
THAT SKIRT
IS SHORTER THAN LILY'S.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.072
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

11:12.105 --> 11:14.975
OH, GOD,
I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
A DISPOSABLE CAMERA.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.143
THOSE THINGS
ARE GARBAGE.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.145
YOU--GIMME,
GIMME, GIMME!

11:18.178 --> 11:21.114
OK. OK.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.783
OH, GOOD.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.118
OH, THAT IS--
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.922
UH-HUH. MM-HMM.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.829
OH. WE'RE JUST
TAKING PICTURES
OF THEIR SKIRTS.

11:36.263 --> 11:40.768
THIS ISN'T FOR US.
IT'S FOR A NUN.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.140
DOORBELL!

11:49.542 --> 11:52.846
SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR!

11:54.047 --> 11:55.816
HEY!

11:57.217 --> 11:59.052
HEY!

11:59.787 --> 12:01.822
Sean: GET OFF
YOUR LAZY BUTT

12:01.855 --> 12:05.092
AND ANSWER
THE DAMN DOOR!

12:12.032 --> 12:14.501
HELLO, BRAD.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.137
WOW. YOU LOOK HOT!

12:17.170 --> 12:19.472
SHUT UP.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.477
I BROUGHT YOU
YOUR HOMEWORK.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.413
I'M NOT GOING TO DO
MY HOMEWORK, BRAD.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.815
I'M NEVER GOING
TO SCHOOL AGAIN

12:27.848 --> 12:29.983
'CAUSE
EVERYBODY THERE
STILL HATES ME.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.218
I STOOD UP FOR YOU.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.053
YOU DID?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.923
I--I WANTED TO!

12:37.124 --> 12:38.458
HELLO, BRAD.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.028
LILY, I
BROUGHT YOU SOME
CARROT STICKS.

12:41.061 --> 12:44.798
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,
PUT DOWN THAT
FIDDLE FADDLE!

12:44.832 --> 12:45.732
NO!

12:45.765 --> 12:46.967
BRAD, TAKE HER
OUTSIDE FOR
SOME FRESH AIR.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.337
GRANDPA, I'M NEVER
LEAVING THE HOUSE,
JUST LIKE AUNT MAUREEN.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.906
I'M EVEN GONNA
BUY MY CAT CHOW
ON THE INTERNET.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.876
OHH. YOU DON'T WANNA
GO THAT WAY, LILY.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.545
SOME DAY
YOUR AUNT MAUREEN
IS GONNA DIE,

12:58.578 --> 13:01.448
AND THOSE CATS
ARE GONNA EAT HER.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.151
SO IT'S KIND OF FUNNY,
ISN'T IT,

13:04.184 --> 13:06.820
ME BEING YOUR LAST...

13:06.854 --> 13:08.188
TEMPTATION?

13:08.221 --> 13:10.057
HA HA! YEAH!

13:10.090 --> 13:13.160
I MEAN,
IT WASN'T ME, RIGHT?

13:14.161 --> 13:16.263
I MEAN,
THERE WASN'T, LIKE,

13:16.296 --> 13:18.899
A LACK OF...

13:18.932 --> 13:21.068
QUALITY...

13:21.101 --> 13:22.369
ON MY PART, RIGHT?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.571
CLAUDIA,
THAT WAS 15 YEARS AGO.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.174
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
A HUSBAND AND KIDS NOW.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.943
OK, YOU'RE NOT
ANSWERING MY QUESTION.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.411
HEY, JIMMY?

13:31.444 --> 13:34.181
JIMMY'S NOT HERE!

13:34.214 --> 13:37.885
OK, SATAN IS NOT
SPEAKING THROUGH YOU.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.352
I JUST WANT TO KNOW

13:39.386 --> 13:42.122
WHAT IT'S
GONNA SOUND LIKE
WHEN HE STARTS.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.423
HEY.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.925
THIS IS
KIND OF COOL!

13:44.958 --> 13:46.059
SHUT UP!

13:46.093 --> 13:49.529
YOU'RE NOT
POSSESSED.
I AM.

13:49.997 --> 13:53.033
UM...HAVE YOU TRIED
TALKING TO JIMMY
ABOUT THIS?

13:53.066 --> 13:57.137
OH, I TRIED,
BUT IT KIND OF
BACKFIRED ON ME.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.306
OK, JIMMY, YOU'RE NOT
POSSESSED BY SATAN

13:59.339 --> 14:01.074
BECAUSE
THERE IS NO SATAN.

14:01.108 --> 14:04.411
MY DAD SAYS THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS SATAN,

14:04.444 --> 14:06.880
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS HELL,

14:06.914 --> 14:09.649
WHICH MEANS
YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,

14:09.682 --> 14:13.220
SO GO RIGHT AHEAD!

14:16.924 --> 14:19.226
SIN ALL YOU LIKE!

14:21.361 --> 14:25.065
AND YOU WONDER WHY
SISTER HELEN HAS IT IN
FOR YOUR FAMILY?

14:25.098 --> 14:27.134
OUT. SHE HAS IT OUT
FOR MY FAMILY,

14:27.167 --> 14:28.969
AND I COULDN'T
HAVE FORESEEN THAT.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.604
AND ANYTHING I DID
JUST MADE IT WORSE...

14:31.638 --> 14:33.106
LIKE THE PICTURES.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.274
THERE.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.475
WHAT?

14:35.508 --> 14:37.210
OPEN IT.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.548
THESE ARE PHOTOS
OF GIRLS' LEGS.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.382
AND WHAT DO YOU SEE?

14:42.415 --> 14:46.086
I SEE A PROFOUNDLY
TROUBLED YOUNG MAN.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.287
NO. IN THE PICTURES.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.521
THOSE ARE
OUR PLAID SKIRTS.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.491
THANK YOU,
AND THE SKIRTS ARE ALL
3 INCHES ABOVE THEIR KNEES.

14:51.524 --> 14:55.662
NOT REGULATION,
AND YET ONLY ONE STUDENT
HAS BEEN PUNISHED FOR THAT,

14:55.695 --> 14:56.696
AND WHO IS THAT?

14:56.729 --> 14:57.364
LILY FINNERTY?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.366
AHA! YOU'VE
SINGLED HER OUT.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.233
THIS IS PERSECUTION.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.434
YOU'VE TURNED MY DAUGHTER
INTO A MARTYR.

15:01.468 --> 15:05.138
MR. FINNERTY, A MARTYR
IS SOMEONE WHO DIES
FOR THEIR FAITH.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.706
I MEAN, NOT LITERALLY
A MARTYR. I--

15:06.739 --> 15:09.009
I DON'T EVEN THINK
SHE'S FIGURATIVELY
A MARTYR.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.277
LOOK. LOOK.
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.312
THE ONLY THING
THAT'S IMPORTANT IS
THAT YOU ADMIT YOU'RE WRONG

15:12.345 --> 15:15.115
AND YOU DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.217
VERY WELL, MR. FINNERTY.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.221
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION
THAT I HAVE BEEN UNFAIR.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.224
I'VE PUNISHED ONE GIRL
FOR BREAKING A RULE

15:24.257 --> 15:27.494
WHEN, IN FACT, ALL THE GIRLS
HAVE BROKEN THAT RULE.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.530
IF YOU CANNOT BE TRUSTED
TO WEAR YOUR SKIRTS

15:30.563 --> 15:32.399
AT A LENGTH
APPROPRIATE TO YOUR AGE,

15:32.432 --> 15:36.203
THEN PERHAPS YOU
SHOULD DRESS LIKE
THE YOUNGER GIRLS DO--

15:36.236 --> 15:37.370
IN THE JUMPER,

15:37.404 --> 15:40.207
AND FOR BRINGING THIS
TO MY ATTENTION,

15:40.240 --> 15:44.277
I'D LIKE TO THANK
LILY FINNERTY.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.349
DO YOU SEE
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.184
I HAD SISTER HELEN
DEAD TO RIGHTS,

15:51.218 --> 15:52.719
AND SHE STILL WOULDN'T
ADMIT SHE WAS WRONG.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.989
SHE'S NOT WRONG.
NUNS ARE MADE
INFALLIBLE BY GOD.

15:56.023 --> 16:02.429
THAT'S THE POPE, AND
ONLY IF HE'S SITTING IN
THE CHAIR OF SAINT PETER.

16:03.696 --> 16:07.200
WHAT, I CAN'T
KNOW STUFF? COME ON.

16:07.234 --> 16:11.171
WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.505
BRAD, GET IN HERE.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.342
SINCE MY ACADEMIC
CAREER IS OVER

16:15.375 --> 16:19.012
AND, AS A RESULT,
MY LIFE IS PRETTY
MUCH RUINED,

16:19.046 --> 16:20.480
I'VE MADE A DECISION.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.350
BRAD IS GOING TO ASK ME
TO MARRY HIM.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.417
I AM?

16:24.451 --> 16:25.385
YES.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.286
WHAT?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.721
HEY, HEY, H-H-H-HEY,
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.590
UH-UH-UH-UH-UH. YOU
ARE NOT GETTIN' MARRIED.

16:30.623 --> 16:34.394
WHY SHOULDN'T I, DAD?
YOU'VE DESTROYED ALL MY
OTHER CHOICES IN LIFE,

16:34.427 --> 16:37.064
AND YOU AND MOM HAVE SET
A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR ME.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.465
IF I CAN'T GET
A GOOD EDUCATION,

16:38.498 --> 16:40.400
I MIGHT AS WELL
GET PREGNANT.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.170
I'M GONNA
GET YOU PREGNANT?

16:43.203 --> 16:46.473
WIPE THAT SMIRK
OFF YOUR FACE.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.775
TIM, SHE'S BEING DRAMATIC.

16:48.808 --> 16:52.212
NO, I'M NOT. YOU
WANT TO KNOW WHAT
MY LIFE HAS BECOME,

16:52.245 --> 16:54.747
THANKS
TO THE JUMPERS?

17:06.726 --> 17:09.129
OH, MY GOD. HA HA!

17:17.837 --> 17:20.340
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
THEY CALL 'EM JUMPERS?

17:20.373 --> 17:23.343
FOLLOW ME
UP TO THE ROOF,
AND I'LL SHOW YOU.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.346
RELAX. LILY,
WE GOT FATHER TIM,

17:26.379 --> 17:29.482
AND HE'S GONNA WAGE
A HOLY WAR ON OUR BEHALF.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.750
RIGHT, TIM?

17:30.783 --> 17:33.453
SEAN, MAN,
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.587
I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU,

17:34.621 --> 17:38.458
BUT YOU JUST
GOT TO UNDERSTAND,
YOU'RE SO TOTALLY WRONG.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.659
I'M NOT WRONG.

17:39.692 --> 17:43.696
FACE IT. TO TAKE HER
ON, YOU HAVE TO HAVE
AN AIRTIGHT CASE,

17:43.730 --> 17:46.633
AND FRANKLY,
YOUR CASE SUCKS.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.736
YOU CAN SAY "SUCKS"?

17:49.769 --> 17:53.573
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE HER SIDE.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.141
I'M SORRY.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.110
YEAH.
I'M SORRY, TOO.

17:57.144 --> 18:01.348
SEAN. MAAAAAH?

18:02.515 --> 18:04.384
MAAAAAH.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.886
OK. CLAUDIA,
IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.589
OH, IT WAS GOOD
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.826
THAT WAS AWKWARD.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.495
YEAH.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.264
OK.
BYE.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.832
THAT WAS REAL SMOOTH.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.368
IT WASN'T ON PURPOSE.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.836
WELL, THAT WORKED OUT
GREAT, DAD.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.339
LOOK. IF YOU HAD NOT
SHORTENED YOUR SKIRT,

18:26.373 --> 18:27.707
I WOULD NEVER
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED.

18:27.740 --> 18:31.378
LOOK, I WAS RIGHT, OK?
I COULDN'T LET SISTER
HELEN GET AWAY WITH IT.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.179
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

18:32.212 --> 18:34.181
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
WHEN TO GIVE IN.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.282
YOU MEAN GIVE UP.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.750
NO, I MEAN GIVE IN,
AS IN SUBMIT,
MAKE CONCESSIONS,

18:37.784 --> 18:38.851
WHICH IS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE.

18:38.885 --> 18:42.455
NO. IN THIS CASE,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SURRENDERING,

18:42.489 --> 18:43.723
WHICH IS UP,
NOT IN.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.359
NO, NO, NOPE.
"IN" IS MORE PRECISE.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.429
OK, THEN. "IN" YOURS.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.530
OH! OH!

18:50.563 --> 18:52.365
GOD, WILL YOU TWO
STOP IT?

18:52.399 --> 18:53.866
YOU ARE
TWO OF A KIND.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.436
THAT'S SO NOT--
THAT'S
SO INSULTING, I--

18:56.469 --> 18:59.606
OK. YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M WRONG.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.642
NEITHER ONE OF YOU
HAVE RIDICULOUS
AUTHORITY PROBLEMS,

19:02.675 --> 19:06.446
AND NEITHER ONE OF
YOU ARE UNBEARABLY
STUBBORN.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.480
SILLY ME.

19:07.514 --> 19:12.652
I'M JUST GONNA
GO UPSTAIRS AND
LENGTHEN A SKIRT.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.959
UH, LOOK,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.729
EXORCISM IS NOT
PART OF MY TRAINING.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.798
I, UH, I THINK
IT'S KIND OF OLD SCHOOL.

19:25.832 --> 19:30.737
COME ON, TIM.
YOU'LL REALLY BE
HELPING OUT OUR FAMILY.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.540
OK.

19:35.408 --> 19:39.479
UH, BY THE POWER
VESTED IN ME

19:39.512 --> 19:42.815
BY, UH...
THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

19:42.849 --> 19:46.653
I HEREBY REQUEST
THAT SATAN VACATE THIS,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.488
YOU KNOW, BOY.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.658
AND HERE'S
THE HOLY WATER.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.627
AH!

19:55.395 --> 19:59.332
IT BURNS!

19:59.366 --> 20:02.502
HEY, THAT WAS MY VODKA.

20:03.703 --> 20:08.508
DID IT WORK?
HAS SATAN LEFT MY BODY?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.443
YEAH. HE BOLTED.

20:10.477 --> 20:14.514
EDDIE, WHY DON'T YOU
WASH THE HOLY WATER
OUT OF HIS EYES?

20:14.547 --> 20:18.318
COME ON. COME ON.
IT'S ALL OVER.
IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.619
WELL DONE, FATHER.

20:19.652 --> 20:23.523
I JUST THREW VODKA
IN A CHILD'S FACE.

20:23.556 --> 20:27.660
WELL, THE LORD WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.997
SO, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

20:31.030 --> 20:32.932
JUST LET
SISTER HELEN WIN?

20:32.965 --> 20:35.535
I KNOW
IT'S EATIN' YOU.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.536
YEAH.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.504
WELL, LOOK.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.939
I'VE FOUND THAT
IN THESE KINDS
OF SITUATIONS

20:39.972 --> 20:41.107
THAT YOU HAVE
2 CHOICES, OK?

20:41.140 --> 20:45.678
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING
DESTRUCTIVE AND
VENGEFUL AND STUPID,

20:45.712 --> 20:47.980
OR YOU CAN JUST
LET IT GO, HMM?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.549
YEAH.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.285
WHOO! WHOO!
HA HA!

20:52.319 --> 20:53.986
HA HA!
HEE HEE!

20:54.020 --> 20:55.922
DID YOU
GET THE MIRRORS?

20:55.955 --> 20:56.856
BOTH OF 'EM.

20:56.889 --> 20:57.990
THAT'S MY GIRL.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.827
OH, GOD, I THINK
I SEE HER COMING.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.695
COME ON. COME ON.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.639
TSK TSK TSK TSK TSK.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.742
Look at her face.
Look at her face.

21:27.854 --> 21:28.555
SO ARE WE GONNA
SET A DATE OR WHAT?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.922
BRAD, WE'RE NOT
GETTING MARRIED.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.591
I WAS USING YOU.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.025
THAT'S OK.

21:33.059 --> 21:36.095
YOU CAN GO HOME NOW.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.029
CALL ME.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.432
NO.
OK.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.335
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.836
WE HAVE A LITTLE
CONFLICT AT THE SCHOOL,

21:43.870 --> 21:47.006
AND YOU HANDLE IT
WITH TOILET PAPER
AND SHAVING CREAM.

21:47.039 --> 21:47.940
OH, YEAH, AND YOU
HANDLED IT SO WELL.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.042
"LOOK AT MY LEGS,
MY BEAUTIFUL LEGS.
WHOO!"

21:50.076 --> 21:51.544
YOU WISH
YOU HAD MY LEGS.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.446
FATHER TIM WISHES
HE HAD YOUR LEGS.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.483
SHUT UP! HA HA!
