VALERY LEGASOV:
What is the cost of lies?

00:10.081 --> 00:11.206
Who is to blame?

00:15.790 --> 00:16.873
It doesn't matter.

00:17.456 --> 00:18.915
WOMAN: It doesn't look right.

00:21.831 --> 00:22.956
MAN: We taste metal.

00:23.581 --> 00:25.748
ENGINEER: I think
there's graphite on the ground.

00:26.373 --> 00:27.414
You didn't see graphite.

00:28.039 --> 00:31.623
(YELLING) You didn't
because it's not there!

00:33.748 --> 00:37.623
We seal off the city. Contain
the spread of misinformation.

00:37.706 --> 00:38.915
(APPLAUSE)

00:39.122 --> 00:40.414
(PHONE RINGS)

00:41.623 --> 00:42.748
(MUFFLED GROANING)

00:44.164 --> 00:45.831
(RINGING CONTINUES)

00:49.331 --> 00:51.706
BORIS SHCHERBINA: (ON PHONE)
Secretary Gorbachev
has appointed a committee

00:51.790 --> 00:53.997
to manage the accident.
You're on it.

01:09.665 --> 01:11.623
(wind blowing softly)

01:11.706 --> 01:14.623
(dosimeter clicking faintly)

01:39.247 --> 01:42.289
(man reading poem
in Ukrainian, over radio)

02:02.331 --> 02:04.539
(man continues reading
poem over radio)

02:22.665 --> 02:25.247
(door opens, closes)

02:28.122 --> 02:30.247
(footsteps approaching)

02:35.873 --> 02:37.539
(turns off radio)

02:39.373 --> 02:41.414
You work too hard.

02:42.706 --> 02:47.331
-Where is everyone?
-Oh, they refused to come in.

02:47.414 --> 02:49.915
-Why?
-It's Saturday.

02:53.039 --> 02:55.373
-Why did you come in?
-I work too hard.

02:55.456 --> 02:57.247
It's boiling in here.

03:01.956 --> 03:04.873
(dosimeter alarm buzzing)

03:09.539 --> 03:10.915
(buzzing stops)

03:12.081 --> 03:14.623
Eight milliroentgen. A leak?

03:14.706 --> 03:15.956
No.

03:16.873 --> 03:19.373
It would've gone off before.
It's coming from outside.

03:19.456 --> 03:21.081
The Americans?

03:22.706 --> 03:25.039
(wind blowing)

03:42.790 --> 03:45.122
(machines humming)

03:49.831 --> 03:51.956
(whirring)

03:52.623 --> 03:56.289
(printer clacking)

04:01.831 --> 04:04.331
Iodine 131.

04:04.414 --> 04:08.247
It's not military.
It's uranium decay, U-235.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.831
Reactor fuel?

04:12.373 --> 04:15.997
Ignalina. Maybe, uh,
240 kilometers away.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.665
(rotary phone dialing)

04:23.498 --> 04:24.706
(line rings)

04:24.790 --> 04:26.581
Yes, this is Ulana Khomyuk

04:26.665 --> 04:29.164
with the Institute
of Nuclear En--

04:29.247 --> 04:30.915
Looking for--?

04:30.997 --> 04:33.956
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

04:35.498 --> 04:38.122
-All right, stay calm.
-Man (over phone):
Don't tell me to stay calm.

04:38.206 --> 04:40.164
(man continuing indistinctly)

04:41.997 --> 04:44.790
They're at four. It's not them.

04:44.873 --> 04:47.581
-Who's the next closest?
-It's Chernobyl,
but that's not possible.

04:47.665 --> 04:49.247
They're 400 kilometers away.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.456
That's too far
for eight milliroentgen.

04:51.539 --> 04:53.164
They'd have to be split open.

04:53.247 --> 04:55.373
Maybe they know something.

04:55.456 --> 04:57.581
(rotary phone dialing)

05:00.456 --> 05:02.331
(line ringing)

05:03.039 --> 05:05.665
-Iodine.
-Could it be
a waste dump?

05:05.748 --> 05:07.122
Khomyuk:
No.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.581
We'd be seeing
other isotopes.

05:09.665 --> 05:12.748
Nuclear test?
Uh, new kind of bomb?

05:12.831 --> 05:16.164
We'd have heard. That's what
half our people work on here.

05:17.623 --> 05:22.373
Something with
the space program
like a satellite or...?

05:22.456 --> 05:24.164
(line ringing)

05:24.247 --> 05:26.373
No one's answering the phone.

05:28.122 --> 05:31.247
(line ringing)

05:37.289 --> 05:38.456
(ringing continues)

05:38.539 --> 05:40.623
(sirens wailing)

05:46.498 --> 05:49.206
-Zinchenko: Get everyone
started on an IV.
-We don't have enough.

05:49.289 --> 05:51.289
-All the children then.
-But we don't have enough!

05:51.373 --> 05:52.790
As many as you can.

05:52.873 --> 05:56.581
-Zinchenko: Where's the old man?
-He's set up a burn ward in 16.

05:57.164 --> 06:00.539
(noisy chattering)

06:10.247 --> 06:11.831
What are you doing?
What is that?

06:11.915 --> 06:14.039
Milk. It's milk.
Much better than water.

06:14.122 --> 06:15.623
No, no, no.
Stop. Stop!

06:15.706 --> 06:18.206
-What are you doing?
-These are radiation burns!

06:18.289 --> 06:20.498
Their clothes are contaminated!

06:20.581 --> 06:22.081
Help me!

06:23.206 --> 06:24.665
Get it all off.

06:24.748 --> 06:25.831
(moaning)

06:25.915 --> 06:27.956
We're taking it
down to the basement.

06:30.873 --> 06:32.498
He was a firefighter
from Chernobyl.

06:32.581 --> 06:34.122
Can you stop pushing,
please?

06:34.206 --> 06:36.039
(muffled shouting)

06:36.122 --> 06:39.581
-(crowd shouting)
-Soldier: We have our orders!

06:39.665 --> 06:42.206
-Disperse!
-Hey, there! Get him!

06:42.289 --> 06:44.206
(Lyudmilla shouts indistinctly)

06:44.289 --> 06:46.706
Woman: Why you
keeping us out here?

06:46.790 --> 06:48.915
(clamoring)

06:50.373 --> 06:52.289
(clamoring)

07:40.706 --> 07:42.623
(door opens, closes)

07:42.706 --> 07:44.456
Professor Legasov?

07:44.539 --> 07:46.164
Oh, no, not yet.

07:46.247 --> 07:48.581
They're finishing up
some other business.
It'll be a few more minutes.

07:48.665 --> 07:51.414
-Can I get you some tea?
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.

07:51.498 --> 07:54.289
Would you care to read
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina's
report while you wait?

07:54.373 --> 07:56.164
Certainly. Thank you.

08:00.206 --> 08:03.206
(door opens, closes)

08:23.831 --> 08:25.915
(paper rustles)

08:35.206 --> 08:37.247
(pages rustling)

08:53.414 --> 08:55.081
(door opens)

08:55.665 --> 08:57.748
Kremlin Aide:
All right, Professor.
They're ready.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.790
Professor Legasov?

09:25.915 --> 09:28.122
Gorbachev:
You have my support.

09:34.456 --> 09:36.373
Gorbachev:
Thank you all for your
duty to this commission.

09:36.456 --> 09:39.539
We will begin with Deputy
Chairman Shcherbina's briefing,

09:39.623 --> 09:43.247
and then we will discuss
next steps if necessary.

09:43.331 --> 09:45.206
Thank you,
comrade General Secretary.

09:45.289 --> 09:49.414
I'm pleased to report
that the situation
in Chernobyl is stable.

09:49.498 --> 09:52.873
Military and civilian patrols
have secured the region,

09:52.956 --> 09:55.122
and Colonel General Pikalov,

09:55.206 --> 09:58.039
who commands troops specializing
in chemical hazards,

09:58.122 --> 10:00.164
has been dispatched
to the plant.

10:00.247 --> 10:02.790
In terms of radiation,
plant director Bryukhanov

10:02.873 --> 10:06.206
reports no more
than 3.6 roentgen.

10:06.289 --> 10:08.581
I'm told it's the equivalent
of a chest X-ray.

10:08.665 --> 10:11.748
So if you're overdue
for a check-up...

10:11.831 --> 10:14.539
-And foreign press?
-Totally unaware.

10:14.623 --> 10:17.247
KGB First Deputy Chairman
Charkov assures me

10:17.331 --> 10:20.414
that we have successfully
protected our security
interests.

10:20.498 --> 10:22.873
Gorbachev:
Good. Very good.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.539
Well, it seems like
it's well in hand, so...

10:26.706 --> 10:29.581
if there's nothing else,
meeting adjourned.

10:30.539 --> 10:32.373
-No!
-(pounds table)

10:34.039 --> 10:36.164
Pardon me?

10:36.247 --> 10:38.581
Uh, we can't adjourn.

10:38.665 --> 10:41.039
This is Professor Legasov
of the Kurchatov Institute.

10:41.122 --> 10:42.997
Professor, if you have
any concerns,

10:43.081 --> 10:45.081
feel free to address
them with me later.

10:45.164 --> 10:48.997
I can't. I am sorry.
I'm so sorry.

10:49.081 --> 10:52.122
Page three,
the section on casualties.

10:52.206 --> 10:53.331
Uh...

10:53.414 --> 10:56.247
"A fireman was severely
burned on his hand

10:56.331 --> 10:58.706
"by a chunk of smooth,
black mineral

10:58.790 --> 11:01.122
on the ground, outside
the reactor building."

11:01.206 --> 11:03.289
Smooth, black mineral--
graphite.

11:03.373 --> 11:06.081
There's-There's graphite
on the ground.

11:08.247 --> 11:11.331
Well, there was a...
a tank explosion.
There's debris.

11:11.414 --> 11:14.289
-Of what importance--?
-There's only one place
in the entire facility

11:14.373 --> 11:17.581
where you will find graphite:
inside the core.

11:17.665 --> 11:19.331
If there's graphite
on the ground outside,

11:19.414 --> 11:21.623
it means it wasn't
a control system tank
that exploded.

11:21.706 --> 11:24.206
It was the reactor core.
It's open! (inhales)

11:27.414 --> 11:29.997
Um, Comrade Shcherbina?

11:30.081 --> 11:32.247
Comrade General Secretary,
I can assure you

11:32.331 --> 11:34.039
that Professor Legasov
is mistaken.

11:34.122 --> 11:36.498
Bryukhanov reports that
the reactor core is intact.

11:36.581 --> 11:38.997
-And as for the radiation--
-Yes, 3.6 roentgen,

11:39.081 --> 11:41.748
which, by the way,
is not the equivalent
of one chest X-ray,

11:41.831 --> 11:44.081
but rather 400 chest X-rays.

11:44.164 --> 11:46.414
That number's been bothering me
for a different reason, though.

11:46.498 --> 11:50.456
It's also the maximum reading
on low-limit dosimeters.

11:50.539 --> 11:53.289
They gave us
the number they had.

11:53.373 --> 11:56.122
I think the true number
is much, much higher.

11:56.206 --> 11:58.915
If I'm right, this fireman
was holding the equivalent

11:58.997 --> 12:01.039
of four million
chest X-rays in his hand.

12:01.122 --> 12:03.498
Professor Legasov,
there's no place
for alarmist hysteria--

12:03.581 --> 12:05.539
It's not alarmist
if it's a fact!

12:05.623 --> 12:08.915
Well, I don't hear
any facts at all.

12:08.997 --> 12:11.539
All I hear is
a man I don't know

12:11.623 --> 12:14.706
engaging in conjecture
in direct contradiction

12:14.790 --> 12:16.915
to what has been reported
by party officials.

12:16.997 --> 12:20.373
I'm, uh...
I apologize.

12:20.456 --> 12:22.873
I didn't mean, uh...

12:22.956 --> 12:26.581
(clears throat)
Please, may I express my concern

12:26.665 --> 12:29.665
as calmly and as
respectfully as I--

12:29.748 --> 12:32.831
-Professor Legasov--
-Gorbachev: Boris.

12:33.873 --> 12:35.706
I will allow it.

12:44.748 --> 12:46.665
Legasov:
Um...

12:48.164 --> 12:50.956
An RBMK reactor

12:51.039 --> 12:55.247
uses uranium 235 as fuel.

12:55.331 --> 13:00.122
Every atom of U-235
is like a bullet

13:00.206 --> 13:02.331
traveling at nearly
the speed of light,

13:02.414 --> 13:04.915
penetrating everything
in its path:

13:04.997 --> 13:08.122
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

13:08.206 --> 13:11.289
Every gram of U-235 holds

13:11.373 --> 13:14.247
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

13:14.331 --> 13:15.790
That's in one gram.

13:15.873 --> 13:19.164
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

13:19.247 --> 13:21.873
and right now, it is on fire.

13:21.956 --> 13:26.289
Winds will carry
radioactive particles
across the entire continent,

13:26.373 --> 13:28.289
rain will bring them down on us.

13:28.373 --> 13:31.456
That's three million
billion trillion bullets

13:31.539 --> 13:35.498
in the... in the air we breathe,

13:35.581 --> 13:38.831
the water we drink,
the food we eat.

13:40.498 --> 13:44.831
Most of these bullets
will not stop firing
for 100 years.

13:44.915 --> 13:48.206
Some of them,
not for 50,000 years.

13:48.289 --> 13:51.997
Yes, and, uh, this concern

13:52.081 --> 13:56.247
stems entirely from
the description of a rock?

14:00.539 --> 14:01.915
Yes.

14:04.247 --> 14:05.539
Hmm.

14:08.623 --> 14:10.414
Comrade Shcherbina...

14:11.456 --> 14:13.790
I want you to go to Chernobyl.

14:13.873 --> 14:15.997
You take a look
at the reactor,
you personally,

14:16.081 --> 14:17.915
and you report
directly back to me.

14:17.997 --> 14:20.206
A wise decision,
comrade General Secretary--

14:20.289 --> 14:22.873
Gorbachev:
And take Professor
Legasov with you.

14:23.748 --> 14:25.081
Shcherbina:
Uh... (chuckles)

14:25.164 --> 14:28.289
Forgive me, comrade
General Secretary, but I--

14:28.373 --> 14:30.748
Do you know how
a nuclear reactor works?

14:32.790 --> 14:34.164
-No.
-Gorbachev: No.

14:34.247 --> 14:37.373
Well, then how will you know
what you're looking at?

14:37.456 --> 14:39.498
Meeting adjourned.

14:57.956 --> 15:00.122
(helicopter blades whupping)

15:38.539 --> 15:40.122
How does a nuclear reactor work?

15:40.206 --> 15:43.164
-What?
-Shcherbina:
It's a simple question.

15:44.498 --> 15:46.331
It's hardly
a simple answer.

15:46.414 --> 15:50.331
Of course, you presume
I'm too stupid to understand.

15:50.414 --> 15:53.706
So I'll restate: Tell me
how a nuclear reactor works,

15:53.790 --> 15:56.665
or I'll have one of these
soldiers throw you out
of the helicopter.

16:06.790 --> 16:10.623
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

16:10.706 --> 16:14.247
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

16:14.331 --> 16:16.289
Where a typical power plant

16:16.373 --> 16:18.247
makes steam by burning coal,

16:18.331 --> 16:20.665
a nuclear plant...

16:25.831 --> 16:30.414
In a nuclear plant, we use
something called fission.

16:30.498 --> 16:36.456
We take an unstable element
like uranium 235,

16:36.539 --> 16:38.498
which has too many neutrons.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.414
-A neutron is, uh--
-The bullet.

16:43.414 --> 16:45.206
Yes, the bullet.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.873
So, bullets are flying
off of the uranium.

16:48.956 --> 16:50.289
Now...

16:50.373 --> 16:55.206
if we put enough
uranium atoms close together,

16:55.289 --> 16:59.665
the bullets from one atom will
eventually strike another atom.

16:59.748 --> 17:02.831
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

17:02.915 --> 17:06.206
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

17:06.289 --> 17:09.039
-And the graphite?
-Ah, yes.

17:09.122 --> 17:12.997
The neutrons are
actually traveling so fast--
we call this "flux"--

17:13.081 --> 17:17.873
it's relatively unlikely
that the uranium atoms
will ever hit one another.

17:17.956 --> 17:22.915
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

17:22.997 --> 17:27.997
to moderate, slow down,
the neutron flux.

17:31.456 --> 17:33.164
Good.

17:33.247 --> 17:36.289
I know how
a nuclear reactor works.

17:37.831 --> 17:40.289
Now I don't need you.

17:42.915 --> 17:45.081
(helicopter blades womping)

17:49.414 --> 17:52.289
(noisy chattering)

17:56.790 --> 17:58.581
(voices clamoring)

17:58.665 --> 18:02.247
-Can you help me?
I need to find my husband.
-No. Not now.

18:06.206 --> 18:07.706
-Mikhail!
-Lyudmilla.

18:07.790 --> 18:09.373
-(infant screaming)
-Take her.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.289
Take her away
from here, please.

18:11.373 --> 18:13.997
-Get away from them!
You want to get sick? Go!
-Mikhail: Oh my God.

18:14.081 --> 18:15.414
Please take her,
please take her.

18:15.498 --> 18:17.247
-(infant screaming)
-Please take her, please.

18:17.331 --> 18:19.706
Please! Please!

18:19.790 --> 18:21.498
Please take her!

18:26.831 --> 18:29.539
Excuse me, I am
Vasily Ignatenko's wife.

18:29.623 --> 18:32.915
He's a fireman.
Ignatenko.

18:32.997 --> 18:36.498
Ignatenko, Sixth Paramilitary
Fire and Rescue Unit.

18:36.581 --> 18:39.498
I need to find him. Please.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.206
Major Burov:
Ignatenko...

18:44.289 --> 18:46.790
He's being transported
by helicopter to Moscow.

18:46.873 --> 18:48.665
Hospital number six.

18:48.748 --> 18:50.873
Why, is he all right?
Can I see him?

18:50.956 --> 18:52.456
You want to see him?
Go to Moscow.

18:52.539 --> 18:54.831
But they're not
letting us leave here.

18:57.373 --> 18:59.665
Tell them Major Burov
allows it.

19:01.206 --> 19:04.206
-Oh. When are
they taking him?
-Now.

19:06.706 --> 19:09.665
(helicopter blades whupping)

19:34.997 --> 19:37.039
Pilot:
We're approaching
the power plant.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.873
Legasov (mutters):
What have they done?

19:45.956 --> 19:47.997
Can you see inside?

19:48.081 --> 19:50.915
I don't have to. Look.

19:50.997 --> 19:52.915
That's graphite
on the roof.

19:52.997 --> 19:55.331
The whole building's
been blown open.

19:55.414 --> 19:56.665
The core's exposed!

19:56.748 --> 19:58.665
I can't see how you can
tell that from here.

19:58.748 --> 20:00.164
Oh, for God's sakes.

20:00.247 --> 20:01.665
Look at that glow!

20:01.748 --> 20:04.414
That's radiation
ionizing the air!

20:04.498 --> 20:06.122
Well, if we can't see,
we don't know.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.831
Get us directly
over the building!

20:07.956 --> 20:09.539
-Boris, if we fly...
-Don't you use my name!

20:09.623 --> 20:11.915
...directly over
an open reactor,
we'll be dead within a week!

20:11.997 --> 20:13.456
Dead!

20:14.414 --> 20:15.623
Pilot:
Sir?

20:15.706 --> 20:18.790
Get us over that building,
or I'll have you shot!

20:19.456 --> 20:21.623
(indistinct radio transmission)

20:22.456 --> 20:24.498
If you fly directly over
that core, I promise you,

20:24.581 --> 20:27.331
by tomorrow morning,
you'll be begging
for that bullet.

20:34.331 --> 20:35.915
(grunts)

21:11.289 --> 21:14.790
(muffled chatter, laughter)

21:15.331 --> 21:17.539
Perhaps if you came
back another day.

21:22.539 --> 21:24.915
Just wonderful.

21:24.997 --> 21:27.414
Khomyuk:
Deputy Secretary Garanin.

21:27.498 --> 21:31.665
Ulana Khomyuk
of the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.081
What a pleasure.

21:33.164 --> 21:36.039
-Let me introduce--
-I'm here about Chernobyl.

21:38.039 --> 21:39.456
Such a lovely time.

21:39.539 --> 21:42.873
-Visit again soon.
-Chulkov: I will. Thank you.

21:55.039 --> 21:57.997
Garanin:
I must tell you, this is
why no one likes scientists.

21:58.081 --> 22:00.831
When we have a disease
to cure, where are they?

22:00.915 --> 22:04.623
In a lab, noses in their books,
and so Grandma dies.

22:04.706 --> 22:05.997
But when there isn't
a problem,

22:06.081 --> 22:07.539
they're everywhere,
spreading fear.

22:07.623 --> 22:09.997
-I know about Chernobyl.
-Oh?

22:10.081 --> 22:12.956
I know that the core is either
partially or completely exposed.

22:13.039 --> 22:15.456
-Whatever that means.
-And that if you
don't immediately

22:15.539 --> 22:18.289
issue iodine tablets
and then evacuate this city,

22:18.373 --> 22:20.997
hundreds of thousands of people
are going to get cancer,

22:21.081 --> 22:23.414
and God knows
how many more will die.

22:23.498 --> 22:25.206
Yes, very good.

22:25.289 --> 22:27.331
There has been
an accident at Chernobyl,

22:27.414 --> 22:29.539
but I've been assured
there is no problem.

22:29.623 --> 22:31.539
I'm telling you
that there is.

22:31.623 --> 22:33.581
I prefer my opinion to yours.

22:33.665 --> 22:36.956
I'm a nuclear physicist.

22:37.039 --> 22:38.623
Before you were
Deputy Secretary,

22:38.706 --> 22:40.373
you worked
in a shoe factory.

22:41.498 --> 22:45.081
Yes, I worked
in a shoe factory.

22:46.122 --> 22:48.247
And now I'm in charge.

22:50.414 --> 22:53.247
"To the workers of the world."

23:14.956 --> 23:17.498
Stable iodine will keep
your thyroid

23:17.581 --> 23:19.956
from absorbing
radioactive iodine.

23:21.122 --> 23:23.915
Take one a day
for as long as they last.

23:23.997 --> 23:25.706
And go east.

23:25.790 --> 23:28.247
Get as far from Minsk
as you can.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.498
Fomin:
It's overkill.

24:03.581 --> 24:05.498
Pikalov's showing off
to make us look bad.

24:05.581 --> 24:08.623
Bryukhanov:
It doesn't matter
how it looks.

24:08.706 --> 24:10.997
Shcherbina is
a pure bureaucrat,

24:11.081 --> 24:13.081
as stupid as
he is pigheaded.

24:13.164 --> 24:15.498
We'll tell him the truth in
the simplest terms possible.

24:15.581 --> 24:17.289
We'll be fine.

24:20.831 --> 24:22.373
Pikarov!

24:47.706 --> 24:50.581
Comrade Shcherbina,
Chief Engineer Fomin,

24:50.665 --> 24:52.623
Colonel General Pikalov, and I

24:52.706 --> 24:53.956
are honored
at your arrival.

24:54.039 --> 24:55.289
Deeply, deeply honored.

24:55.373 --> 24:58.331
Naturally, we regret
the circumstances of your visit,

24:58.414 --> 25:00.581
but, as you can see, we are
making excellent progress

25:00.665 --> 25:02.206
in containing the damage.

25:02.289 --> 25:07.456
We have begun our own inquiry
into the cause of the accident,

25:07.539 --> 25:10.539
and I have a list of individuals

25:10.623 --> 25:13.414
who we believe are accountable.

25:35.456 --> 25:36.956
Bryukhanov:
Professor Legasov,
I understand

25:37.039 --> 25:39.373
you've been saying
dangerous things.

25:39.456 --> 25:41.247
Fomin:
Very dangerous things.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.665
Apparently,
our reactor core exploded.

25:44.331 --> 25:48.581
Please, tell me how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

25:50.456 --> 25:52.790
I'm not prepared to explain it
at this time.

25:52.873 --> 25:55.748
As I presumed,
he has no answer.

25:55.831 --> 25:58.331
It's disgraceful, really.

25:58.414 --> 26:01.915
To spread disinformation
at a time like this.

26:07.956 --> 26:10.665
Why did I see graphite
on the roof?

26:10.748 --> 26:12.873
Graphite is only
found in the core,

26:12.956 --> 26:16.414
where it's used as
a neutron flux moderator.

26:16.498 --> 26:17.915
Correct?

26:18.873 --> 26:22.331
Fomin, why did
the Deputy Chairman
see graphite on the roof?

26:23.581 --> 26:25.373
Well, that... that can't be.

26:26.247 --> 26:28.915
Comrade Shcherbina,
my apologies, but graphite...

26:28.997 --> 26:30.206
that's not possible.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.539
Perhaps you saw
burnt concrete.

26:32.623 --> 26:34.414
Now there you made a mistake,

26:34.498 --> 26:37.122
because I may not know much
about nuclear reactors,

26:37.206 --> 26:38.831
but I know a lot
about concrete.

26:39.665 --> 26:42.164
-Comrade, I assure you--
-I understand.

26:42.997 --> 26:45.623
You think Legasov is wrong.

26:45.706 --> 26:47.665
How shall we prove it?

26:48.956 --> 26:52.206
Our high-range dosimeter
just arrived.

26:52.289 --> 26:55.247
We could cover one of our
trucks with lead shielding,

26:55.331 --> 26:57.665
mount the dosimeter
on the front.

27:03.456 --> 27:06.665
Have one of your men
get as close to the fire
as he can.

27:06.748 --> 27:08.414
Give him every bit
of protection you have.

27:08.498 --> 27:10.790
But understand that
even with lead shielding,

27:10.873 --> 27:12.873
it may not be enough.

27:14.706 --> 27:16.581
Then I'll do it myself.

27:21.247 --> 27:23.206
Good.

28:00.122 --> 28:02.206
(tires screech)

28:05.122 --> 28:07.414
(engine revving)

28:26.706 --> 28:28.831
(chains shattering)

29:20.997 --> 29:22.831
He's back.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.956
It's not three roentgen.

29:54.039 --> 29:55.790
It's 15,000.

29:55.873 --> 29:58.539
Bryukhanov:
Comrade Shcherbina--

29:58.623 --> 30:00.081
What does that number mean?

30:00.164 --> 30:02.331
It means the core is open.

30:02.414 --> 30:04.873
It means the fire we're
watching with our own eyes

30:04.956 --> 30:06.456
is giving off nearly
twice the radiation

30:06.539 --> 30:08.373
released by the bomb
in Hiroshima.

30:08.456 --> 30:10.247
And that's every
single hour.

30:10.331 --> 30:13.414
Hour after hour, 20 hours
since the explosion,

30:13.498 --> 30:14.956
so 40 bombs worth by now.

30:15.039 --> 30:16.373
Forty-eight more tomorrow.

30:16.456 --> 30:19.289
And it will not stop.
Not in a week, not in a month.

30:19.373 --> 30:20.873
It will burn
and spread its poison

30:20.956 --> 30:23.665
until the entire
continent is dead.

30:26.790 --> 30:29.039
Please escort Comrades
Bryukhanov and Fomin

30:29.122 --> 30:31.456
to the local
party headquarters.

30:31.539 --> 30:33.081
-Thank you
for your service.
-Comrade--

30:33.164 --> 30:34.539
You're excused.

30:35.581 --> 30:37.373
Dyatlov was in charge.

30:38.247 --> 30:40.122
It was Dyatlov!

30:40.206 --> 30:42.831
-Tell me how to put it out.
-We'll use helicopters.

30:42.915 --> 30:45.665
-We'll drop water on it
like a forest fire.
-No, no. You don't understand.

30:45.748 --> 30:48.039
This isn't a fire.

30:48.122 --> 30:49.956
This is a fissioning
reactor core

30:50.039 --> 30:52.331
burning at over
2,000 degrees.

30:52.414 --> 30:53.997
The heat will instantly
vaporize the water--

30:54.081 --> 30:57.247
-How do we put it out?
-(sighs)

30:58.456 --> 31:00.414
You are dealing
with something

31:00.498 --> 31:04.956
that has never occurred
on this planet before.

31:06.915 --> 31:08.456
Boron.

31:09.831 --> 31:11.831
Boron and sand.

31:11.915 --> 31:14.539
Well, that'll create
problems of its own,

31:14.623 --> 31:16.706
but I-I don't see
any other way.

31:16.790 --> 31:18.873
Of course, it's going to take
thousands of drops,

31:18.956 --> 31:21.539
because you can't fly
the helicopters directly
over the core,

31:21.623 --> 31:22.997
so most of it
is going to miss.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.206
-How much sand and boron?
-(scoffs) Well, I can't be--

31:25.289 --> 31:29.206
-For God's sake, roughly!
-Five thousand tons.

31:29.289 --> 31:32.164
And obviously,
we're going to need
to evacuate an enormous area--

31:32.247 --> 31:34.164
Never mind that.
Focus on the fire.

31:34.247 --> 31:36.997
I am focusing
on the fire.

31:37.081 --> 31:41.206
The wind, it's carrying
all that smoke,

31:41.289 --> 31:43.039
all that radiation.

31:43.122 --> 31:46.122
At least evacuate Pripyat.
It's three kilometers away.

31:46.206 --> 31:48.122
-That's my decision to make.
-Then make it.

31:48.206 --> 31:50.873
-I've been told not to.
-Is it or is not--

31:50.956 --> 31:52.748
I'm in charge here!

31:52.831 --> 31:54.498
This will go much easier
if you talk to me

31:54.581 --> 31:55.831
about the things
you do understand

31:55.915 --> 31:58.665
and not about the things
you do not understand.

32:02.414 --> 32:03.915
Where are you going?

32:03.997 --> 32:07.831
Shcherbina:
I'm going to get you
5,000 tons of sand and boron.

32:15.706 --> 32:17.831
There's a hotel.

32:44.081 --> 32:46.206
(phone ringing)

33:01.581 --> 33:03.581
(music playing over speakers)

33:10.373 --> 33:12.831
(woman chattering
indistinctly)

33:13.623 --> 33:15.706
I'd prefer one of those.

33:23.748 --> 33:25.581
Woman:
Superstitious?

33:34.414 --> 33:36.247
Moscow?

33:39.706 --> 33:42.081
Are you here
because of the fire?

33:46.373 --> 33:48.915
Anything we should
be worried about?

33:52.915 --> 33:54.289
(sighs)

33:54.373 --> 33:55.956
No.

34:02.915 --> 34:04.289
(glass taps bar twice)

34:06.456 --> 34:07.956
Ah.

34:20.956 --> 34:23.790
(wind blowing)

34:37.164 --> 34:40.414
(trees rustling)

34:44.665 --> 34:46.997
(helicopters whupping)

34:54.039 --> 34:56.206
(indistinct radio transmissions)

35:00.373 --> 35:03.039
Pilot (over radio):
We're in position.
Approaching drop.

35:04.164 --> 35:06.289
Stasiuk: (over radio):
Clear to proceed.

35:07.665 --> 35:10.873
Pilot:
Copy. We'll go
one by one in rotation.

35:16.039 --> 35:18.164
Remind them about the perimeter.

35:21.665 --> 35:23.831
They cannot fly directly
over the fire.

35:23.915 --> 35:26.122
A minimum of
a ten-meter perimeter.

35:26.206 --> 35:27.623
Pilot:
Ten meter perimeter. Copy.

35:27.706 --> 35:29.247
Lead One, per pre-flight:

35:29.331 --> 35:32.039
maintain minimum
ten-meter perimeter.

35:32.122 --> 35:33.206
Lead One:
Copy that.

35:33.289 --> 35:35.956
Forty meters... 35...

35:36.039 --> 35:37.289
30...

35:37.373 --> 35:39.539
(radio static crackling)

35:40.915 --> 35:43.122
No, no, no!
They're too close!

35:43.206 --> 35:44.997
They can't get over the fire.
How are they supposed--

35:45.081 --> 35:46.956
The wind will have to carry it.

35:47.039 --> 35:49.915
Tell them, they cannot
go over the core.

35:52.331 --> 35:53.581
Stasiuk:
Lead One is too close.

35:53.665 --> 35:55.539
I repeat,
they are too close.

35:56.206 --> 35:58.039
Pilot:
Copy.

35:58.122 --> 36:00.956
Lead One, you are
inside the perimeter.

36:01.039 --> 36:04.164
Lead One:
Did not copy.
Signal's breaking up.

36:04.247 --> 36:06.581
(radio static crackling)

36:06.665 --> 36:09.081
Pilot:
Lead One?

36:09.164 --> 36:10.748
Do you copy?

36:10.831 --> 36:12.748
Lead One, do you copy?

36:12.831 --> 36:14.956
Lead One, come in.

36:15.039 --> 36:16.831
Do you copy, Lead One?

36:16.915 --> 36:18.623
Lead One!

36:20.164 --> 36:22.748
(helicopter engine whines)

36:36.456 --> 36:39.122
Stasiuk:
Sir? What do
I tell the others?

36:41.456 --> 36:43.331
Is there any other way, Legasov?

36:43.414 --> 36:46.831
(distant helicopters thrumming)

36:51.956 --> 36:53.831
Send the next one in.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.289
Tell them to approach
from the west.

36:58.373 --> 37:01.498
Stasiuk:
Lead Two, approach
from the west.

37:20.081 --> 37:22.206
(phone ringing)

37:22.289 --> 37:24.915
Marina:
Kurchatov Institute
Laboratory Four.

37:24.997 --> 37:29.456
(over phone):
Marina Gruzinskaya,
it's Ulana Khomyuk from Minsk.

37:31.665 --> 37:34.247
Oh, yes, how nice
of you to phone.

37:34.331 --> 37:36.247
-It's been too long.
- It has.

37:36.331 --> 37:38.915
I was actually calling
about our friend.

37:38.997 --> 37:41.247
-You know,
the one in the country.
- Oh, yes, of course.

37:41.331 --> 37:45.081
I wanted to see how he's doing.
It's so hot there right now.

37:45.164 --> 37:47.581
Yes, it's extremely hot,

37:47.665 --> 37:48.997
but his nephews are flying down,

37:49.081 --> 37:51.081
and they always
bring cool weather.

37:51.164 --> 37:52.790
Oh? Which nephews?

37:53.539 --> 37:57.581
Simka, who's 14,
and little Boris, who's five.

37:57.665 --> 37:58.873
Well, that's wonderful.

37:58.956 --> 38:00.748
Though children can
make you even hotter

38:00.831 --> 38:02.581
when they're crawling
all over you.

38:02.665 --> 38:04.081
Maybe I should visit them.

38:04.164 --> 38:05.956
No, they don't want visitors.

38:06.039 --> 38:08.331
I'm sorry, um,
I have to get back to work.

38:08.414 --> 38:10.831
It's very busy right now.
Goodbye.

38:13.665 --> 38:16.206
They're dropping sand
and boron on the fire.

38:17.206 --> 38:18.748
It's what I would do.

38:20.539 --> 38:22.247
Yes, I'm sure it is.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.206
Dmitri:
Where are you going?

38:47.247 --> 38:48.706
Chernobyl.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.164
(door opens, closes)

38:56.247 --> 38:59.039
It's been smooth.
Twenty drops.

38:59.122 --> 39:01.289
(distant helicopters thrumming)

39:05.081 --> 39:06.539
What?

39:09.373 --> 39:12.414
There are 50,000 people
in this city.

39:12.498 --> 39:17.122
(sighs)
Professor Ilyin,
who's also on the commission,

39:17.206 --> 39:20.081
says the radiation isn't
high enough to evacuate.

39:20.164 --> 39:21.831
Ilyin isn't a physicist.

39:21.915 --> 39:24.915
Well, he's a medical doctor.
If he says it's safe, it's safe.

39:24.997 --> 39:27.456
-Not if they stay here.
-We're staying here.

39:27.539 --> 39:31.956
Yes, we are, and we'll be dead
in five years.

39:32.039 --> 39:34.289
(distant helicopters thrumming)

39:39.915 --> 39:42.373
I'm sorry, I...

39:42.456 --> 39:43.997
I'm sorry.

40:05.039 --> 40:06.956
(phone rings)

40:10.331 --> 40:12.456
(phone rings)

40:15.623 --> 40:17.997
(phone rings)

40:20.997 --> 40:22.331
(phone rings)

40:22.414 --> 40:23.706
Shcherbina.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.623
(distant helicopters thrumming)

40:29.039 --> 40:31.289
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

40:35.164 --> 40:36.498
Thank you.

40:42.665 --> 40:46.539
A nuclear plant in Sweden
has detected radiation

40:46.623 --> 40:49.706
and identified it
as a byproduct of our fuel.

40:50.831 --> 40:53.498
The Americans took
satellite photos.

40:54.456 --> 40:57.748
The reactor building,
the smoke, the fire.

40:57.831 --> 40:59.373
(sighs)

41:00.456 --> 41:02.373
Shcherbina:
The whole world knows.

41:08.956 --> 41:11.539
The wind has been blowing
toward Germany.

41:12.956 --> 41:15.539
They're not letting
children play outside...

41:17.414 --> 41:18.997
in Frankfurt.

41:21.373 --> 41:23.539
(boys chattering outside)

41:30.623 --> 41:32.498
Want a smoke?

41:47.915 --> 41:50.498
Peter Jennings:
There has been a nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union

41:50.581 --> 41:52.331
and the Soviets have
admitted that it happened.

41:52.414 --> 41:53.956
The Soviet version is this:

41:54.039 --> 41:55.456
One of the atomic reactors

41:55.539 --> 41:58.122
at the Chernobyl Atomic Power
Plant near the city of Kiev

41:58.206 --> 42:00.790
was damaged, and there is
speculation in Moscow

42:00.873 --> 42:03.081
that people were injured
and may have died.

42:03.164 --> 42:06.289
The Soviets may have been
fairly quick to acknowledge
the accident

42:06.373 --> 42:09.665
because evidence in the form
of mild nuclear radiation

42:09.748 --> 42:13.790
had already reached
beyond the Soviet borders
to Scandinavia.

42:46.748 --> 42:52.164
(woman announcing
over loudspeaker,
in foreign language)

42:54.790 --> 42:56.956
(announcement continuing)

43:09.997 --> 43:12.456
(announcement continuing)

43:13.164 --> 43:15.206
(alarms blaring)

43:21.331 --> 43:23.498
(announcement continuing)

43:44.706 --> 43:47.539
(announcement continuing)

44:06.539 --> 44:08.706
(announcement continuing)

44:19.373 --> 44:21.498
(girl crying)

44:22.498 --> 44:24.873
(announcement continuing)

44:55.247 --> 44:58.456
(announcement continuing)

45:25.706 --> 45:28.331
(siren wailing)

45:30.331 --> 45:32.456
(announcement continuing)

45:47.790 --> 45:51.997
(announcement continuing)

45:55.039 --> 45:57.164
(announcement fading)

46:12.331 --> 46:14.498
(distant helicopters thrumming)

46:28.414 --> 46:30.831
I said turn around.
This is a restricted zone.

46:30.915 --> 46:35.289
-I'm from the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.
-Do you have permission?

46:35.373 --> 46:37.623
Listen to me, I need to speak
to someone urgently.

46:37.706 --> 46:40.081
Turn around right now,
or I'll arrest you.

46:40.164 --> 46:41.915
If you arrest me,
you should take me

46:41.997 --> 46:44.206
to the highest
possible authority.

46:48.706 --> 46:51.247
Legasov:
We have to start
a radiological survey.

46:51.331 --> 46:55.539
Sector by sector, on foot,
dosimeters in hand.

46:57.164 --> 46:58.915
Are you all right?

47:01.539 --> 47:02.873
Of course.

47:04.081 --> 47:05.414
Comrades--

47:05.498 --> 47:08.122
The guards arrested this woman
at the south checkpoint.

47:08.206 --> 47:12.456
-I'd have put her in a cell--
-But he thought you should
know that I know.

47:12.539 --> 47:14.331
I know that your reactor
core is exposed.

47:14.414 --> 47:17.331
I know the graphite is on fire,
the fuel is melting,

47:17.414 --> 47:19.331
and you're dropping sand
and boron on it,

47:19.414 --> 47:22.665
which you probably thought was
smart, but you've made a
mistake.

47:22.748 --> 47:25.831
Ulana Yuriyvna Khomyuk,
Chief Physicist,

47:25.915 --> 47:28.206
Byelorussian Institute
for Nuclear Energy.

47:28.289 --> 47:31.539
And you are Valery
Alexeyevich Legasov?

47:31.623 --> 47:34.164
Smothering the core
will put the fire out,

47:34.247 --> 47:37.039
but the temperature will
eventually increase--

47:37.122 --> 47:38.665
Legasov:
Believe me,
I'm perfectly aware.

47:38.748 --> 47:40.790
But I estimate
at least a month

47:40.873 --> 47:42.790
before it melts through
the lower concrete pad,

47:42.873 --> 47:44.790
-which gives us time--
-No, you don't have a month.

47:44.873 --> 47:46.581
You have approximately two days.

47:47.498 --> 47:50.706
Yes, the fuel would
take a month

47:50.790 --> 47:52.831
to reach the concrete pad here.

47:52.915 --> 47:56.414
But first...
it's going to burn through

47:56.498 --> 47:58.873
the biological shield here
by Tuesday.

47:58.956 --> 48:01.956
And when it does,
it's going to hit these tanks--

48:02.039 --> 48:03.331
bubbler pools, reservoirs--

48:03.414 --> 48:06.581
Reservoirs for the ECS.
I understand your concern,

48:06.665 --> 48:08.581
but I confirmed it
with plant personnel.

48:08.665 --> 48:12.247
-The tanks are nearly empty.
-No, they were nearly empty.

48:12.331 --> 48:15.790
Each of these points
here, here, and here

48:15.873 --> 48:17.873
all drain
to the bubbler pools.

48:17.956 --> 48:20.498
I'm guessing that every pipe
in the building ruptured.

48:20.581 --> 48:23.539
And then there are
those fire engines
that I saw on the way in.

48:23.623 --> 48:25.748
The fire hoses
are still connected.

48:25.831 --> 48:28.873
They've been gushing
water into the structure
this whole time.

48:28.956 --> 48:30.915
The tanks are full.

48:32.915 --> 48:35.456
The tanks are full.

48:37.997 --> 48:40.206
(speaking foreign language)

49:04.414 --> 49:05.665
(door opens)

49:14.456 --> 49:18.748
I have ten minutes,
then I'm back on the phone

49:18.831 --> 49:21.748
apologizing to our friends,

49:21.831 --> 49:24.997
apologizing to our enemies.

49:25.081 --> 49:28.414
Our power comes from
the perception of our power.

49:28.498 --> 49:32.122
Do you understand
the damage this has done?

49:32.206 --> 49:35.414
Do you understand
what's at stake?

49:37.039 --> 49:38.373
Boris.

49:40.456 --> 49:44.873
Professor Legasov
will deliver our briefing.

49:46.539 --> 49:48.039
There is some good news.

49:48.122 --> 49:50.790
The air drops are working
to douse the fire.

49:50.873 --> 49:54.623
There's been a reduction
in radionuclide emissions,

49:54.706 --> 49:56.539
but the fire will not
be extinguished

49:56.623 --> 49:59.498
for at least
another two weeks.

50:01.414 --> 50:04.414
There is also
an additional problem.

50:05.956 --> 50:07.706
Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

50:07.790 --> 50:10.456
simply because
it is not on fire.

50:10.539 --> 50:12.164
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

50:12.247 --> 50:14.956
as a result of the blanket
of sand we've dropped.

50:15.039 --> 50:17.831
The uranium will melt the sand,

50:17.915 --> 50:19.623
creating a kind of lava

50:19.706 --> 50:22.997
which will begin to melt down
through the shield below.

50:23.081 --> 50:24.623
You have made lava?

50:27.289 --> 50:29.414
I anticipated this.

50:30.915 --> 50:33.206
I believed there was
time to reinforce

50:33.289 --> 50:35.331
this lower concrete pad

50:35.414 --> 50:36.873
before the lava
reached the earth

50:36.956 --> 50:38.498
and contaminated
the groundwater.

50:38.581 --> 50:41.665
But as it turned out, I was
worried about the wrong thing.

50:41.748 --> 50:43.623
Uh, um...

50:43.706 --> 50:47.289
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

50:47.373 --> 50:49.956
under the reactor were
essentially empty.

50:50.039 --> 50:53.122
This is Ulana Khomyuk
of the Byelorussian Institute.

50:53.206 --> 50:55.498
Thanks to her insight,
we are now aware

50:55.581 --> 50:58.873
that the tanks are,
in fact, full.

50:58.956 --> 51:02.831
Of water. Why is that
a problem, professor?

51:04.039 --> 51:05.498
(clears throat)

51:07.122 --> 51:08.790
When the lava
enters these tanks,

51:08.873 --> 51:11.206
it will instantly
superheat and vaporize

51:11.289 --> 51:14.956
approximately 7,000
cubic meters of water,

51:15.039 --> 51:18.539
causing a significant
thermal explosion.

51:18.623 --> 51:20.581
How significant?

51:20.665 --> 51:24.539
We estimate between
two and four megatons.

51:24.623 --> 51:27.915
Everything within
a 30-kilometer radius

51:27.997 --> 51:29.665
will be completely destroyed,

51:29.748 --> 51:33.081
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

51:33.164 --> 51:36.665
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

51:36.748 --> 51:39.831
will be ejected at force

51:39.915 --> 51:42.956
and dispersed by
a massive shock wave,

51:43.039 --> 51:48.247
which will extend
approximately 200 kilometers

51:48.331 --> 51:51.623
and likely be fatal
to the entire population of Kiev

51:51.706 --> 51:53.748
as well as a portion of Minsk.

51:53.831 --> 51:56.748
The release of radiation
will be severe

51:56.831 --> 52:00.081
and will impact
all of Soviet Ukraine,

52:00.164 --> 52:03.790
Latvia, Lithuania,
Byelorussia,

52:03.873 --> 52:07.122
as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

52:07.206 --> 52:09.873
Romania,
and most of East Germany.

52:13.539 --> 52:16.414
What do you mean "impact"?

52:17.206 --> 52:19.748
For much of the area,
a nearly permanent disruption

52:19.831 --> 52:22.373
of the food and water supply,

52:22.456 --> 52:25.456
a steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

52:25.539 --> 52:28.997
I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

52:29.081 --> 52:30.956
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

52:31.039 --> 52:33.373
"impact" means
completely uninhabitable

52:33.456 --> 52:36.873
for a minimum of 100 years.

52:40.706 --> 52:44.122
There are more
than 50 million people

52:44.206 --> 52:46.956
living in Byelorussia
and Ukraine.

52:47.039 --> 52:48.873
Sixty, yes.

52:53.247 --> 52:54.997
And how long
before this happens?

52:55.081 --> 52:58.956
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

53:02.414 --> 53:04.831
But we may have a solution.

53:04.915 --> 53:06.706
We can pump the water
from the tanks.

53:06.790 --> 53:10.206
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

53:10.289 --> 53:12.414
and the gate can only
be opened manually

53:12.498 --> 53:14.039
from within
the duct system itself.

53:14.122 --> 53:17.289
So we need to find
three plant workers

53:17.373 --> 53:18.956
who know the facility
well enough

53:19.039 --> 53:20.665
to enter the basement here,

53:20.748 --> 53:24.997
find their way through
all these duct ways,

53:25.081 --> 53:27.164
get to the sluice gate
valve here,

53:27.247 --> 53:31.706
and give us the access we need
to pump out the tanks.

53:31.790 --> 53:34.539
Of course, we will need
your permission.

53:34.623 --> 53:36.665
My permission for what?

53:36.748 --> 53:39.206
Uh, the water in these ducts,

53:39.289 --> 53:42.122
the level of radioactive
contamination--

53:42.206 --> 53:44.623
They'll likely be
dead in a week.

53:46.373 --> 53:50.122
We're asking for your
permission to kill three men.

53:58.289 --> 53:59.665
Well...

53:59.748 --> 54:02.331
Comrade Legasov...

54:02.414 --> 54:06.164
(clears throat)
all victories inevitably
come at a cost.

54:42.456 --> 54:44.539
(dogs panting)

55:08.915 --> 55:11.039
(wind blowing)

55:31.289 --> 55:35.122
Legasov:
And open the sluice gate
valve... here.

55:35.206 --> 55:37.206
The valve will be
difficult to operate,

55:37.289 --> 55:39.122
so we'll need three men

55:39.206 --> 55:42.748
who will need to know
the basement layout.

55:42.831 --> 55:46.790
And, of course, any volunteers
will be rewarded.

55:46.873 --> 55:51.289
A yearly stipend of 400 rubles.

55:57.373 --> 56:02.331
And, uh, for those
of you working in reactors
one and two, promotions.

56:02.414 --> 56:06.164
Why are reactors one and two
still operating at all?

56:06.247 --> 56:08.331
My friend was a security
guard that night,

56:08.414 --> 56:09.997
and, uh, she's now dying.

56:10.081 --> 56:12.706
And we've all heard
about the firemen.

56:12.790 --> 56:16.790
And now you want us to swim
underneath a burning reactor?

56:17.581 --> 56:19.706
Do you even know how
contaminated it is?

56:19.790 --> 56:21.289
(clears throat)

56:21.790 --> 56:23.665
I... I don't have
an exact number.

56:23.748 --> 56:26.623
You don't need an exact number
to know if it'll kill us.

56:27.247 --> 56:29.164
But you can't even
tell us that.

56:30.456 --> 56:32.873
Why should we do this?
For what, 400 rubles?

56:32.956 --> 56:34.790
(murmurs in agreement)

56:36.414 --> 56:39.164
You'll do it
because it must be done.

56:43.748 --> 56:47.122
You'll do it
because nobody else can.

56:49.456 --> 56:53.122
And if you don't,
millions will die.

56:54.289 --> 56:57.247
If you tell me that's not
enough, I won't believe you.

56:58.456 --> 57:02.539
This is what has always
set our people apart.

57:02.623 --> 57:05.831
A thousand years
of sacrifice in our veins.

57:06.665 --> 57:09.456
And every generation
must know its own suffering.

57:10.498 --> 57:13.247
I spit on the people
who did this,

57:13.331 --> 57:15.956
and I curse the price
I have to pay.

57:18.081 --> 57:20.498
But I'm making
my peace with it,

57:20.581 --> 57:22.331
and now you make yours.

57:22.414 --> 57:25.164
And go into that water.

57:27.247 --> 57:28.915
Because it must be done.

57:28.997 --> 57:31.164
(distant helicopters thrumming)

57:46.164 --> 57:47.706
Ananenko.

57:52.039 --> 57:53.539
Bezpalov.

57:58.706 --> 58:00.539
Baranov.

58:48.247 --> 58:50.414
(distant helicopters thrumming)

59:55.373 --> 59:57.498
(dosimeters clicking)

59:59.831 --> 1:00:01.956
(door shuts)

1:00:05.164 --> 1:00:06.373
(grunts)

1:00:53.081 --> 1:00:54.997
(dosimeter clicking)

1:01:19.373 --> 1:01:20.414
(grunts)

1:01:47.706 --> 1:01:49.539
(dosimeter's clicking
grows louder)

1:02:03.539 --> 1:02:05.623
(dosimeter crackling loudly)

1:02:15.247 --> 1:02:16.623
(grunts)

1:02:20.122 --> 1:02:21.831
-(clicking grows louder)
-(water gushing)

1:02:21.915 --> 1:02:22.956
(grunts urgently)

1:02:29.247 --> 1:02:30.748
(grunts)

1:02:39.623 --> 1:02:41.790
(dosimeter clicking rapidly)

1:02:43.498 --> 1:02:45.790
-(tapping)
-(grunting)

1:02:50.706 --> 1:02:52.956
(dosimeters clicking
loudly, rapidly)

1:02:54.665 --> 1:02:55.706
(grunts)

1:02:57.706 --> 1:02:59.790
(dosimeters clicking
loudly, rapidly)

1:02:59.873 --> 1:03:02.122
(men panting)

1:03:02.206 --> 1:03:03.164
(tapping)

1:03:03.247 --> 1:03:05.081
-(panting)
-(tapping)

1:03:05.164 --> 1:03:07.331
(loud, rapid clicking
continuing)

1:03:07.997 --> 1:03:10.247
-(tapping)
-(rapid, heavy breathing)

1:03:10.331 --> 1:03:11.665
(silence)
