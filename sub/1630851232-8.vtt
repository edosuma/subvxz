WEBVTT

00:06.136 --> 00:08.530
- She's coming for us.
- Why does it feel so personal?

00:08.573 --> 00:10.445
Because it is.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.142
Do you guys know that
Veronica is forcing me

00:12.186 --> 00:13.187
to see patients again?

00:13.230 --> 00:14.666
- Seriously?
- Yes.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.277
- And she knows that
you were threatened

00:16.320 --> 00:17.713
and attacked
by a patient, right?

00:17.756 --> 00:20.063
- Yeah, made that pretty
abundantly clear and yet--

00:20.107 --> 00:21.195
- You know, she's been
pitting me against

00:21.238 --> 00:22.587
Baptiste playing us
off each other.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.763
A real "there can
only be one" vibe.

00:24.807 --> 00:27.723
Well, she's extorting me.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.377
- Wait?
- I'm sorry, what?

00:29.420 --> 00:31.553
For--for actual money?

00:31.596 --> 00:34.643
- Donations for the hospital's
endowment fund.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.471
- She expects you to fund
this whole hospital?

00:36.514 --> 00:38.386
- That's ludicrous.
What is she thinking?

00:38.429 --> 00:39.778
I don't know.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.432
Maybe she heard my family
has money or something.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.782
God.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.697
- You--you guys know
what's happening, right?

00:45.741 --> 00:47.177
She's trying to push us out.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.526
- Mm-hmm,
she sees us as a threat.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.093
- We're Max's people.
- Yeah.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.530
- Yeah, well, in two weeks
Max is jumping ship

00:52.574 --> 00:55.098
leaving
the rest of us here to sink.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.708
- Whoa, whoa, hold up, no,
back that up.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.710
That's not happening.
We've known Max

00:58.754 --> 01:01.148
for three years.
Has he ever let you down?

01:01.191 --> 01:04.281
Not me, all right?
He is going to handle Veronica.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.196
And I'll bet you money
right now

01:06.240 --> 01:07.458
he is ten steps ahead of her.

01:07.502 --> 01:12.246
- Oh, God, I--I am so behind.
- You think?

01:12.289 --> 01:15.162
I mean, here I am
with multiple graduate degrees,

01:15.205 --> 01:16.511
and I'm struggling to pack

01:16.554 --> 01:18.556
a container full
of other bloody containers.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.341
- Luna's grandparents
are never allowed to buy her

01:20.384 --> 01:22.647
another stuffed animal again.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.607
- "We've got acres of time
to pack," he said.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.609
"We'll start packing tomorrow,"
he said.

01:27.652 --> 01:30.873
- Yeah, well, what happened
to all that highly organized

01:30.916 --> 01:32.570
Bristol fashion
I kept hearing about?

01:32.614 --> 01:34.137
- It booked passage
on the "Titanic"

01:34.181 --> 01:35.617
the minute I fell in with you.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.663
- What do you say
we just burn it all down?

01:38.707 --> 01:41.449
- Wait? Even the Tupperware?
- Especially the Tupperware.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.585
- We're really leaving,
aren't we?

01:47.629 --> 01:49.239
- Yeah.
- I feel like

01:49.283 --> 01:52.155
I'm abandoning our hospital
after all it gave me.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.765
Don't you feel pangs of guilt?

01:53.809 --> 01:55.593
- Yeah, I did,
but then I packed it up

01:55.637 --> 01:57.769
with the rest
of the bathroom stuff.

01:57.813 --> 02:02.774
We're not abandoning anybody.
We're just choosing ourselves.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.298
That's okay.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.474
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.

02:06.517 --> 02:08.911
Say it with me.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.434
It's gonna be okay.

02:10.478 --> 02:15.613
- Yeah, but say it again
like you actually believe it.

02:15.657 --> 02:16.788
both: It's gonna be okay.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.486
- Yeah, you can
do better than that.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.705
both: It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.403
- It's gonna be okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.709
It's gonna be okay.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.330
This is not okay.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.941
- I think you're actually
allergic to a balanced budget.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.291
- That's not balanced.
That's upside down

02:41.335 --> 02:43.685
and you're gonna leave
this place unrecognizable.

02:43.728 --> 02:46.296
- Do you know what else
is unrecognizable?

02:46.340 --> 02:49.517
This hospital's operating
expenses during COVID.

02:49.560 --> 02:53.216
There wasn't enough room on
the form for a number that big.

02:53.260 --> 02:56.741
So desperate times,
desperate measures.

02:56.785 --> 02:59.614
- You are calling
for the firing of three dozen

02:59.657 --> 03:01.268
of this hospital's top doctors,

03:01.311 --> 03:05.315
Dr. Reynolds, Dr. Bloom, Dr.
Frome, Hartman, Flores--

03:05.359 --> 03:08.275
Laying them off, yes.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.843
Those top doctors have
departments that are top-heavy.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.759
Look at the numbers, Max.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.588
This isn't personal. It's math.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.895
- Yeah, well,
here's some math for you.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.592
You need two signatures
for this,

03:21.636 --> 03:23.464
and you're never getting mine.
If I don't co-sign

03:23.507 --> 03:25.944
this piece of garbage,
then it is dead on arrival.

03:25.988 --> 03:28.512
Who's got the leverage now?
If you'll excuse me,

03:28.556 --> 03:30.993
I've got some very important
emails to attend to.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.736
Hey, here's one on compassion
and empathy in the workplace.

03:34.779 --> 03:39.480
Maybe I'll just forward
that one to you.

03:39.523 --> 03:42.222
- I'll let you know
when I get it.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.623
I understand, Dr. Sharpe,

03:52.667 --> 03:56.366
I just wish
it was gonna be you.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.715
Oh, so do I, Gillian,

03:57.759 --> 04:01.458
but believe me,
I'm leaving you in good hands.

04:01.502 --> 04:02.807
Is now a good time?

04:02.851 --> 04:04.722
- Speaking of,
I would like to introduce you

04:04.766 --> 04:07.551
to the wonderfully talented
Dr. Agnes Kao.

04:07.595 --> 04:10.424
She's the acting interim chair
of our neurology department.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.688
- Actually, I've been the full
chair for quite some time now.

04:13.731 --> 04:16.517
- Really?
- For several months, yeah.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.954
Ms. Sorel, it's a pleasure
to meet you

04:18.997 --> 04:20.390
and equally important,

04:20.434 --> 04:23.698
you have to talk to me
about this cool bag.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.569
- It's my daughter
Trini's favorite.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.529
And in true fourth-grade
fashion, she forgot it at home.

04:28.572 --> 04:32.489
So after today's treatment,
I'll be running it over.

04:32.533 --> 04:35.057
- Yes, we should talk
about today's treatment.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.888
- I know your expressions
at this point, Dr. Sharpe.

04:39.931 --> 04:43.370
Just say it.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.329
Your lymphoma didn't respond

04:46.373 --> 04:48.723
to the last
round of chemo as we hoped.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.511
- But there is a new option
available for central nervous

04:54.555 --> 04:56.818
system lymphomas like yours.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.776
- Instead of the normal
chemo infusion,

04:58.820 --> 05:00.430
we would like to inject
high-dose

05:00.474 --> 05:03.390
methotrexate directly
into your cerebrospinal fluid.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.653
- It requires we bore
a small hole in your skull

05:05.696 --> 05:06.958
just to access the area.

05:07.002 --> 05:10.005
- Hang on, guys;
you want to inject chemo

05:10.048 --> 05:13.095
directly into my brain
through a hole in my skull?

05:13.138 --> 05:16.620
- Despite how it sounds,
it's an outpatient procedure.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.405
Very safe.

05:18.448 --> 05:21.103
- With Dr. Kao and I,
you are in great hands.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.540
You'll be dropping off
that amazing bag to Trini

05:23.584 --> 05:26.021
in no time at all, okay?

05:28.415 --> 05:32.332
Okay.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.685
I am so sorry, Agnes,

05:37.728 --> 05:39.948
I had no idea that
you'd been made full chair.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.863
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.473
It's unconscionable.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.388
- You've been so focused
on your big move to London.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.608
No reason to keep tabs
on the rest of us.

05:47.651 --> 05:50.001
- Agnes, you have received
a position of power

05:50.045 --> 05:52.569
at one of the top medical
institutions in the country.

05:52.613 --> 05:53.831
As a woman of color,

05:53.875 --> 05:56.660
do you realize
the rarefied air you are in?

05:56.704 --> 05:58.749
I'm guessing pretty rarefied.

05:58.793 --> 06:01.404
Yes, It's stratospheric.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.797
And it's happening
right at a time

06:02.840 --> 06:05.147
when Veronica is taking over.
There's no way

06:05.190 --> 06:08.063
I can leave you to face life
under her regime unequipped.

06:08.106 --> 06:11.153
- I definitely don't want
to be unequipped.

06:11.196 --> 06:14.417
- Look, starting from today
and for the rest of the time

06:14.461 --> 06:15.723
I'm here, we are gonna meet,

06:15.766 --> 06:17.028
and I'm gonna tell you
everything I know.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.639
I'm gonna help you strategize,

06:18.682 --> 06:20.162
I'm gonna tell you
where the bodies are buried.

06:20.205 --> 06:21.468
Like a mentor?

06:21.511 --> 06:25.428
- Yeah.
Yeah, exactly like a mentor.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.778
We are gonna get you
battle-ready.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.568
- Okay, great.
So until next week, all right?

06:34.611 --> 06:38.528
- Thank you.
- Tough session?

06:38.572 --> 06:40.051
- Oh, my God.
I should not be in there.

06:40.095 --> 06:43.185
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is, Gladys.

06:43.228 --> 06:48.233
I--I used to at least know
what to say, you know.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.061
I used to be able to help
a patient contextualize

06:50.105 --> 06:51.889
a breakthrough or navigate them
through the weeds.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.935
Now it's, like, nothing.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.545
I'm like a question mark
in there.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.504
- You're still getting
your sea legs back.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.680
No, I'm not.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.551
You know, when therapy is going
well it feels like music.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.771
It's like,
I can--I can hear music

07:03.814 --> 07:05.686
in my heart and in my mind like
there's a rhythm.

07:05.729 --> 07:06.904
It's a dance.
I know when to push.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.471
I know when to listen.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.692
I know how to help.
Now I'm just...

07:11.735 --> 07:16.044
I--I don't hear it.
I'm not hearing a single note.

07:16.087 --> 07:18.916
Oh, Iggy.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.702
- All right,
I'm just--I need some air.

07:21.745 --> 07:22.746
I'll be back.

07:41.722 --> 07:44.289
Veronica stopped me again.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.727
Said she found a way to

07:46.770 --> 07:49.512
"take some pressure
off my department."

07:49.556 --> 07:51.122
- Well, she all but begged me
to sell your ass

07:51.166 --> 07:53.908
down the river.

07:53.951 --> 07:54.996
Divide and conquer.

07:55.039 --> 07:58.782
- Mm-hmm,
till the best man wins.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.088
- I don't want to have to
fight you

08:00.131 --> 08:04.135
to keep this job, Floyd,

08:04.179 --> 08:07.835
but I'm not gonna lay down.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.712
- Who says we have to
play her game?

08:18.193 --> 08:19.847
What are you up to?

08:19.890 --> 08:22.284
I don't know.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.982
If you ask me,

08:25.026 --> 08:28.159
the woman don't know
who she messing with.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.250
All right, folks,
today we will be performing

08:32.294 --> 08:34.252
a robotic-assisted
coronary artery

08:34.296 --> 08:38.213
bypass graft
using this baby right here.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.825
Now, three-dimensional images
of the heart

08:41.869 --> 08:43.566
will be displayed
on these monitors.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.786
I'll be running point
operating the arm over here,

08:45.829 --> 08:48.919
and watching my back today
and every day is

08:48.963 --> 08:53.620
our very own chair of surgery,
Dr. Claude Baptiste.

08:56.231 --> 08:57.275
Let's dance.

08:59.713 --> 09:03.934
- Chester Larkin, returning.
- I'll take it over there.

09:03.978 --> 09:06.110
Chester, hey,
thanks for calling us back.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.677
Yeah, I got a voice mail

09:07.721 --> 09:11.855
saying I had to get
my pacemaker interrogated.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.683
- It's not a good cop,
bad cop kind of thing.

09:13.727 --> 09:14.902
Just a simple procedure.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.034
- Oh, well,
that's good to hear,

09:17.078 --> 09:19.254
but the only thing is,
I can't have a surgery today.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.560
I'm on a shift.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.126
- Oh, well, we don't even
need you to come in.

09:22.170 --> 09:25.216
We run the diagnostics remotely
through your cardiac pacer

09:25.260 --> 09:27.305
just to make sure
it's doing its job.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.698
Does it hurt?

09:28.742 --> 09:31.048
<i>- You ready to find out?</i>
<i>- I guess so.</i>

09:31.092 --> 09:36.184
- All right, so open the app
on your phone.

09:39.796 --> 09:42.669
Okay, now what?

09:42.712 --> 09:47.412
- And it has started.
Easy peasy.

09:47.456 --> 09:50.154
- I got to be the only bionic
handsome cabdriver

09:50.198 --> 09:51.895
in all of New York.

09:51.939 --> 09:55.812
- Wonders of the internet,
right?

09:58.946 --> 10:00.774
Schedule is still not done?

10:00.817 --> 10:04.125
- My system was set up for four
residents, and now we got five.

10:04.168 --> 10:07.650
Just takes longer.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.305
Who knew I'd
ever need long division again?

10:10.348 --> 10:12.786
- Well, wrap it up, Einstein;
we need you out there.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.265
My point exactly.

10:14.309 --> 10:17.268
We're so short on nurses,
but we have extra residents.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.183
It's weird.
Don't you think it's weird?

10:19.227 --> 10:20.315
You know what, Casey?

10:20.358 --> 10:22.099
Who cares
how many residents we have?

10:22.143 --> 10:24.275
Four? Five?
I mean, they're all talented.

10:24.319 --> 10:27.017
Would it kill you
to do a little math? God.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.117
Okay, Gladys, I am back.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.642
I had a moment there.
I apologize.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.167
And what the heck
are you doing to that mouse?

10:48.822 --> 10:51.694
- All our patient files
are missing.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.043
That's impossible.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.479
- No, I looked everywhere.
They're just gone.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.786
- Okay, did you click
on the little house?

10:56.830 --> 10:58.309
The little house is gone.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.877
- The little house
can't be gone.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.059
Oh. What the hell?

11:11.758 --> 11:14.151
- So there's no room
for negotiation?

11:14.195 --> 11:17.154
- Always be extremely firm
in your position with Veronica.

11:17.198 --> 11:20.810
Never back down, or she'll
steamroll right over you.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.511
Hang on. That can't be right.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.035
What's the matter?

11:28.078 --> 11:30.167
- The chemo reservoir.
It's empty.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.996
- But isn't all dosing
networked through the pharmacy?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.476
- Yeah, they're supposed
to control

11:34.519 --> 11:36.826
everything that gets delivered
down to the microgram.

11:36.870 --> 11:39.437
- Wait, but if the
reservoir's empty--

11:39.481 --> 11:41.439
They just pushed five times

11:41.483 --> 11:45.008
the chemo directly
into Gillian's brain.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.531
But that would be fatal.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.185
- Agnes, our patient is
gonna code within ten minutes.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.926
We need to get to the ED now.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.723
Dissecting the LAD.

12:06.421 --> 12:09.859
Isolating a graft
insertion site.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.514
- The margin on the left is
looking a little narrow, Floyd.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.473
I'd inch over a bit
to accommodate.

12:15.517 --> 12:19.086
Thank you very much.

12:19.129 --> 12:21.392
- I mean, I would move over
just a touch.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.047
I'm trying to.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.441
Is there lag time
in the command?

12:26.484 --> 12:30.140
- No.
- Hmm.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.403
- Floyd,
wh--what are you doing?

12:32.447 --> 12:34.449
It's not me.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.324
Floyd, Floyd, BP's dropping.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.196
Stop the robotic surgery
before more damage is done.

12:42.239 --> 12:45.286
It's not responding.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.853
- Doctor, we're not
controlling the arm.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.159
What?

12:49.203 --> 12:51.118
Then who the hell is?

13:01.215 --> 13:01.389
.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.739
- The hack's a work of a group
known to us as Disco Bunny.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.219
Doesn't sound very scary.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.655
Disco Bunny is a former GRU

13:06.698 --> 13:09.353
cyber cell
who have attacked 253 hospitals

13:09.397 --> 13:11.138
and healthcare clinics
around the world.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.400
Maybe a little scary.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.358
- Yeah, they're ruthless,
cruel, greedy,

13:14.402 --> 13:16.578
and when you opened that email,
Dr. Goodwin,

13:16.621 --> 13:19.059
you gave them the keys
to your kingdom.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.234
What are our options?

13:20.277 --> 13:21.670
Limited I'm afraid.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.454
The Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign

13:23.498 --> 13:25.761
Assets Control is quite clear.
Those who pay a cyber-ransom

13:25.805 --> 13:27.589
may face civil
and criminal penalties.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.243
What? Are you serious?

13:29.286 --> 13:31.071
- Yes, it only encourages
further attacks, and this year

13:31.114 --> 13:32.376
has already seen
an increased targeting

13:32.420 --> 13:33.856
of hospital
and healthcare providers.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.554
- So what are we
supposed to do?

13:36.598 --> 13:38.687
- Well,
our cybersecurity experts

13:38.730 --> 13:40.254
can help restore
New Amsterdam's

13:40.297 --> 13:42.822
compromised network
department by department.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.476
What's the timeline on that?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.652
- Weeks...to months.
- Months?

13:47.696 --> 13:50.394
Listen, we're not a tech
company or some oil pipeline.

13:50.438 --> 13:53.397
We're a hospital with patients
who depend on us every day.

13:53.441 --> 13:56.574
We have to pay that ransom.

13:56.618 --> 13:59.708
- Well, in situations like this
you can request a certification

13:59.751 --> 14:01.579
of OFAC compliance
to avoid the penalties.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.320
- Great, that's what
we're gonna do.

14:03.364 --> 14:06.410
- Uh, uh, no, hang on.
This is a public hospital.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.804
We do not have $10 million
just lying around.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.588
Yeah, but HCC does.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.721
- The fact that I am here
right now is living proof

14:12.764 --> 14:14.331
they do not
trust you with money.

14:14.375 --> 14:18.770
They are not giving you
a dime, Max, and you know it.

14:18.814 --> 14:22.296
But HCC might give it to me.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.649
Of course,
we have to prove to them

14:27.692 --> 14:31.609
that we are serious about
our fiscal responsibility.

14:31.653 --> 14:34.917
Sign the budget, Max.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.615
Get them out of our network.

14:37.659 --> 14:40.401
We're gonna weather the storm.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.925
Lauren, you need to put the ED
on diversion now.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.448
- Why? What's going on?
- This might sound

14:44.492 --> 14:46.015
like something out of
a James Bond movie,

14:46.059 --> 14:48.409
but a Russian-backed cyber cell
has hacked the hospital

14:48.452 --> 14:51.455
and are currently worming their
way through every department.

14:51.499 --> 14:52.935
Holy hell.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.328
Yeah.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.199
- Walsh, order
a Special Services Diversion.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.548
Ship 'em all to Baptiste.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.246
- You got it.
- Turan, treat and transfer.

14:59.289 --> 15:00.769
This is really happening?

15:00.812 --> 15:02.423
- Yeah, the FBI is here,
and every minute that goes by

15:02.466 --> 15:03.903
these hackers gain more
control,

15:03.946 --> 15:05.556
and every piece of equipment
networked to our system

15:05.600 --> 15:06.601
could be compromised.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.342
- Chester.
- Who?

15:08.385 --> 15:10.257
- Chester Larkin.
I was running an interrogation

15:10.300 --> 15:13.738
on his cardiac pacer.
Can you give him a call?

15:17.003 --> 15:20.397
- Computer is jacked.
- They're locking us out.

15:20.441 --> 15:23.618
Walsh, try yours.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.663
- That's not good.
- He's not answering, Lauren.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.535
- You've gotta find him.
- In all of Manhattan? How?

15:27.578 --> 15:29.406
- He's a horse carriage driver
in Central Park.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.365
Go.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.892
- No patient files.
No SOAP notes.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.851
No session schedules.
I mean, Iggy,

15:39.895 --> 15:42.680
all of our patients'
prescriptions, they vanished.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.595
- Hi, yeah, this is Dr. Frome
from Behavioral Health.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.771
We're having a bit of an
IT problem that--

15:46.815 --> 15:48.208
yeah, yes, I'll hold.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.993
- We have a floor full
of inpatients with no record

15:51.037 --> 15:52.821
of what they take
or when they're taking it.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.736
We don't even know
when they got their last dose.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.172
- I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.782
What does a rabbit have to do
with extortion-ware?

16:00.437 --> 16:03.875
Oh, my God.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.703
Maybe I can just...

16:05.747 --> 16:07.009
No, no, no, no, no, don't,

16:07.053 --> 16:09.011
Gladys.
Okay, and there's the rabbit.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.361
Okay, we've been hacked.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.276
The entire hospital
has been compromised.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.495
For how long?

16:14.538 --> 16:15.975
- I don't know.
She said weeks maybe.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.934
- Iggy, how are we gonna figure
out what medications

16:18.978 --> 16:20.544
our psych patients need

16:20.588 --> 16:22.764
before they all start
going through withdrawal?

16:22.807 --> 16:28.291
I...I don't know.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.424
Thorax filled with blood.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.426
Where's it coming from?

16:36.517 --> 16:38.867
I found Chester.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.522
- He's tachycardic.
BP 185 or 115.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.785
- Chester, can you hear me?

16:43.828 --> 16:45.265
What's happening to me?

16:45.308 --> 16:47.006
- Your pacemaker defibrillator
is misfiring.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.834
- It's shocking your heart.
- Why? Why?

16:49.878 --> 16:51.401
- It's been triggering every
few seconds the whole way here.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.663
- Okay, let's get him
to Trauma One. Let's go.

16:52.707 --> 16:55.666
- Incoming.
- Chemo overdose.

16:55.710 --> 16:56.798
Okay, find me a donut magnet.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.017
- Copy.
- What the hell?

16:58.060 --> 16:59.409
- Cranial infusion
chemotherapy.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.889
- She got a massive dose
of methotrexate.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.499
Fever, tachypneic.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.066
I mean, it must have been
a truckload of chemotherapy.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.459
Turan, let's set 'em up
in the procedure room.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.591
- Let's go.
- Got it. Come on.

17:07.635 --> 17:08.853
- What's her mental state?
- Altered.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.464
- Her blood pressure
was down 80 over 40.

17:10.507 --> 17:11.595
- The chemo
is flooding her brain.

17:11.639 --> 17:12.640
It's destroying her cells.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.076
We need to start
leucovorin now.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.773
- We can't; her blood pressure
is way too low.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.427
Well, then we need to fix it.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.995
Okay, come on; we got you.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.913
I'm gonna lower the bed.

17:28.047 --> 17:32.877
Hooking up your IV.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.494
Come on, Gillian.

17:40.537 --> 17:44.063
- My daughter.
- Come on.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.716
BP's up to 100 over 60.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.501
- Good.
Now we can start leucovorin.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.068
Hang in there, Gillian.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.419
Shut it down.

17:52.462 --> 17:56.031
Yes, I'm serious.
Transfer the ICU to Uni now.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.337
We're falling apart here.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.686
Yeah, I just came from ortho.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.383
Their whole department
is in chaos.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.863
We gotta do something.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.430
Well, we are doing something.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.996
We're listening to
the FBI's guidance.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.390
Do not pay, and do not
embolden the criminals.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.479
- We can't weather this, okay?
I was wrong.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.829
Someone is gonna get hurt.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.832
- Do you want me to use
my back channels

18:14.876 --> 18:18.619
to pressure HCC
to find the money?

18:18.662 --> 18:22.144
Would you do that?

18:22.188 --> 18:23.972
Max, this is a political job.

18:24.015 --> 18:26.540
If I'm cashing in
a chip that big,

18:26.583 --> 18:29.064
I'm gonna need
something in return.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.545
Your signature.

18:36.550 --> 18:40.423
- These are good people,
the ones you'd be firing.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.991
- We are both trying
to save this hospital.

18:43.034 --> 18:47.865
You might not see it right now,
but we're on the same team.

19:00.835 --> 19:01.052
.

19:01.096 --> 19:04.012
- Okay, 5 mils morning,
10 mils night.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.883
You are a lifesaver.
Thank you very much.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.015
Yeah, talk soon.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.451
Okay, so I was able
to reach out

19:08.495 --> 19:09.974
to ten of our patient's
previous doctors

19:10.018 --> 19:11.715
and confirm our regimen.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.108
- 11 of our patients
had family members

19:13.152 --> 19:14.718
who were able
to reconstruct their doses.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.503
- Nice.
Okay, and nine of our patients

19:16.546 --> 19:18.809
are currently on drug washout,
so they don't take any meds.

19:18.853 --> 19:22.030
- So what do we do
about the last five?

19:24.598 --> 19:26.077
Purple circles.

19:26.121 --> 19:30.865
No, used to be circles,
now triangles.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.214
Sodium Valproate.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.825
- 80 milligrams of Prozac
every day since 1991.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.436
- Thank you; that's great.
- Why do you think

19:36.479 --> 19:38.002
I'm so damn peppy
all the damn time?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.787
- Oh, gosh,
there's so many of them.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.571
It takes like two glasses
of water to swallow 'em all.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.226
Of course, I can't remember
what they're called now.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.010
So sorry,
I'm totally ruining your day.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.448
- No, no, no, you're not.
It's okay.

19:48.491 --> 19:52.191
They're for anxiety.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.932
Aripiprafy, two pills.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.108
I usually get
my midday dose about now.

19:57.152 --> 19:59.981
- That's great, Angelo.
Thank you so much.

20:00.024 --> 20:02.940
- No clue what you give me,
but I used to feel like...

20:02.984 --> 20:07.031
wacka-wacka-wacka-wacka,
chh-chh-chh-chh-chh,

20:07.075 --> 20:09.947
And now I feel like...

20:09.991 --> 20:12.559
shhooo.

20:12.602 --> 20:16.824
Okay, thank you.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.783
- Hey, you okay?
How can I help?

20:19.827 --> 20:22.656
- Oh, hey, I've got
a question for you.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.223
Have you ever called
a dozen parents to see

20:24.266 --> 20:26.050
if they might know
their kids' medications?

20:26.094 --> 20:27.574
Sorry about all this.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.793
- FYI, blaming all of this
on Russian cyber pirates

20:29.837 --> 20:31.839
really just raises
more questions than answers.

20:31.882 --> 20:32.970
- Yeah.
- This is--

20:33.014 --> 20:34.015
this is horrible, Max.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.016
There's gotta be
a better solution.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.191
Well, there is a solution,

20:36.235 --> 20:37.584
but the cure
is worse than the disease.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.977
- What--whatever it is,
pull the trigger.

20:40.021 --> 20:43.590
- If you knew what it was,
you wouldn't be saying that.

20:43.633 --> 20:49.160
- If it helps the patients,
do it, all right?

20:49.204 --> 20:50.901
- Suction.
- LAP PAD.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.903
- He's gonna flatline
if we don't find that bleeder.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.514
- What if it's not down,
it's up?

20:54.557 --> 20:55.993
- What do you mean?
- We've been searching

20:56.037 --> 20:59.301
the bottom of the
surgical field, not the top.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.173
- There, internal mammary
artery along the chest wall.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.828
- Aw, yeah, good eye,
but damn tricky location.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.177
Can you reach it?

21:06.221 --> 21:07.178
- Yeah, just need you
to retract the heart.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.310
I got you, brother.

21:08.354 --> 21:11.531
- Clamp.
- Suture.

21:11.574 --> 21:12.532
- Okay.
- Got it?

21:12.575 --> 21:14.185
- Yeah.
- Okay, hold.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.623
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.799
Another.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.322
Get in there.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.063
- That looks good.
- Looks good.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.195
- Come on.
- You got it. You got it.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.980
Come on. Come on. Hold

21:26.023 --> 21:26.981
You got it. You got it.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.200
Ohh, let's go.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.899
There you go. Nice job.

21:31.942 --> 21:32.943
Thanks.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.560
- I know, buddy, I know, okay?
Hang in there.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.562
We're gonna try and suspend
these shocks, okay?

21:42.605 --> 21:44.912
- Your ICD
has a magnet-sensitive switch.

21:44.955 --> 21:49.220
This should reset it.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.700
Yeah?

21:50.744 --> 21:53.094
Maybe.

21:54.182 --> 21:56.097
- Maybe not.
Try another angle.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.185
Okay.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.666
Come on.
Come on.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.191
Please make it stop.

22:03.234 --> 22:05.846
- Lauren, I don't understand.
This should have worked.

22:05.889 --> 22:08.327
They're in the network.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.372
Okay, push 100 milligrams
of Atenolol.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.722
We're going with plan B.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.942
What the hell is plan B?

22:14.985 --> 22:17.205
- I'm gonna have to take that
pacemaker out of his chest.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.863
- What's happening?
What happened?

22:22.906 --> 22:24.168
I don't know.

22:24.212 --> 22:25.909
His pulse is racing;
his tongue's swollen.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.868
- I need an EpiPen now.
He's anaphylactic. All right.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.696
- He's so warm.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.262
Thank you.
Okay, stay with me, Angelo.

22:31.306 --> 22:35.745
Stay with me, buddy.
Stay with me. Breath.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.704
There he is.
There you are. There you are.

22:37.747 --> 22:40.097
Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me.

22:40.141 --> 22:43.100
You're okay. You're okay.
Take a deep breath.

22:43.144 --> 22:45.755
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

22:45.799 --> 22:49.368
Okay.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.891
It just happened so fast.

22:50.934 --> 22:55.635
- Yeah, because we gave him
the wrong meds.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.903
- Hey, you got a sec?
- Oh, Max, please tell me

23:02.946 --> 23:04.383
there's a plan to solve this.
I've got patients--

23:04.426 --> 23:06.080
- Veronica's using
the hack against me.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.516
What do you mean?

23:07.560 --> 23:08.735
- In order to get the money
to save this hospital

23:08.778 --> 23:12.739
I had to sign this budget.

23:12.782 --> 23:15.872
People we know and love
are about to be hurt.

23:20.007 --> 23:22.139
Fired.

23:22.183 --> 23:23.924
Max, this is bad.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.710
- Yeah.
- Wa--was there any other way?

23:27.754 --> 23:33.890
- No, I mean, unless you got
$10 million lying around.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.239
I keep telling myself

23:35.283 --> 23:36.937
that we're not abandoning
our friends,

23:36.980 --> 23:40.070
that we're not turning our
backs on this hospital, but...

23:45.467 --> 23:48.165
I don't know what to do.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.298
The only thing you can do.

23:50.341 --> 23:54.171
You have to tell them yourself

23:54.215 --> 23:59.002
before they find out
from someone else.

23:59.046 --> 24:02.179
Max, look at me.

24:11.014 --> 24:14.017
It's gonna be okay.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.193
Say it.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.108
It's gonna be okay.

24:19.196 --> 24:20.763
It's gonna be okay.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.722
- It's gonna be okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

24:22.765 --> 24:25.072
It's gonna be okay.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.900
It's gonna be okay.

24:34.081 --> 24:34.255
.

24:34.298 --> 24:39.173
- Hey, is he stable?
- He's stable.

24:43.046 --> 24:44.657
This is my fault.

24:44.700 --> 24:48.356
- The other patients we asked
described pill shapes, colors,

24:48.399 --> 24:49.618
feelings that they had.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.665
Angelo specifically
asked for Aripiprafy,

24:52.708 --> 24:55.145
specifically for two pills.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.626
He knew he was allergic?

24:57.670 --> 25:00.455
Why--why would he want to
hurt himself?

25:00.499 --> 25:03.153
- Good question.
Talk to him and find out.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.379
- What happened?
- She's bleeding from her gums.

25:11.422 --> 25:12.598
BP's down, heart rate's up.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.164
She's going into
hemorrhagic shock.

25:14.208 --> 25:17.994
- I've already hung
2 units of blood.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.561
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

25:19.605 --> 25:22.216
- We are not giving up
on you, Gillian.

25:22.259 --> 25:26.568
- Look at me. Don't go there.
Reverse your thinking, okay?

25:26.612 --> 25:28.135
You still have to drop off

25:28.178 --> 25:31.138
that cool backpack
with your daughter, right?

25:31.181 --> 25:32.313
Trini.

25:32.356 --> 25:35.055
- Right,
don't give up, not yet.

25:35.098 --> 25:38.232
For Trini.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.234
Reverse your thinking.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.279
We somehow need
to reverse the chemo.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.238
What does that mean?

25:44.281 --> 25:48.677
- It is a--it's a intravenous
dose of Uridine Triacetate.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.418
Has it ever been done before?

25:50.461 --> 25:52.159
- I've only read case
reports of it ever working,

25:52.202 --> 25:55.162
but I don't see
a better way, do you?

25:55.205 --> 25:56.642
Almost got it.

26:02.517 --> 26:05.172
Oh, got it.

26:06.652 --> 26:10.090
Oh, his heart's crapping out.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.440
No pulse. Run a pacing wire.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.442
- Wait. Isn't it connected
to the same network?

26:14.485 --> 26:19.621
Oh, damn it. Move, move.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.188
- At least we know
this way works.

26:21.231 --> 26:22.406
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

26:22.450 --> 26:24.104
- Come on, you can't keep
that up forever.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.453
Eight, nine, ten...

26:25.496 --> 26:26.933
- I'm--I'm gonna
get Lucas in here.

26:26.976 --> 26:30.197
- No, we don't need Lucas.
Casey, I don't want Lucas.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.026
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

26:33.069 --> 26:36.029
Come on, Chester, come on,
come on, stay with me.

26:36.072 --> 26:37.639
- Lucas coming in hot.
- Five, six, seven.

26:37.683 --> 26:42.035
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

26:42.078 --> 26:45.604
Actually,
it wasn't a bad idea.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.128
Chester, meet Lucas.
Lucas, meet Chester.

26:48.171 --> 26:49.608
- What's the longest
you've ever used him?

26:49.651 --> 26:52.306
- I'm pretty sure
it's gonna be today.

26:52.349 --> 26:53.350
Two, three...

26:55.091 --> 26:56.310
So I'm guessing you knew

26:56.353 --> 26:59.052
you were highly allergic
to Aripiprafy.

27:01.358 --> 27:04.057
All right.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.278
Why don't you
tell me why you're here

27:08.322 --> 27:10.759
in New Amsterdam
and just start there?

27:19.463 --> 27:23.337
Okay.

27:23.380 --> 27:27.210
Angelo, I am going
to shoot you straight.

27:27.254 --> 27:30.213
It's that kind of day.

27:30.257 --> 27:32.563
The way you treat
a suicide attempt varies

27:32.607 --> 27:35.131
based on the patient's
medical history.

27:35.175 --> 27:38.482
And today we--

27:38.526 --> 27:43.096
we lost every shred of data
we have on you,

27:43.139 --> 27:45.359
and you clearly
don't want to talk,

27:45.402 --> 27:47.840
and I would rather
let you not talk,

27:47.883 --> 27:49.537
but it would be
criminally irresponsible

27:49.580 --> 27:51.670
and negligent of me
to not get your basic info.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.063
So why don't you give me
the quickest, shortest version

27:54.107 --> 27:56.500
of why you're here, and I
will get out of your hair?

27:56.544 --> 27:58.677
Why?

28:01.244 --> 28:02.724
So we can help you.

28:05.466 --> 28:09.078
- I'm here because I had
an Adderall overdose.

28:09.122 --> 28:15.128
I--I went days without sleep,
brought on a psychosis,

28:15.171 --> 28:17.783
now I have brain damage.

28:21.438 --> 28:24.572
My brain works at 1/2
the speed it used to.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.443
I used to be smart,
and now I'm dumb.

28:26.487 --> 28:29.664
Can you help with that?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.144
- Not with the
processing speed, no.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.276
That--that will
probably never come back.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.539
Not probably; it's gone.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.541
Yeah.

28:37.585 --> 28:41.458
- You don't know
what it's like to...

28:41.502 --> 28:44.592
to...

28:50.685 --> 28:54.123
Christ, I can't even
find words anymore.

28:55.821 --> 29:00.651
It's like I'm...

29:00.695 --> 29:01.740
Like you're not you.

29:03.785 --> 29:06.788
Yeah.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.616
I mean, you know,

29:08.659 --> 29:10.792
everyone sees the same you
on the outside,

29:10.836 --> 29:15.362
but...

29:15.405 --> 29:19.279
on the inside it's, like,
that's different.

29:19.322 --> 29:20.584
Something is missing.

29:20.628 --> 29:21.803
But no,
it's worse than missing.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.805
It's--it's gone.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.808
You don't recognize yourself.

29:28.505 --> 29:32.466
- I look in the mirror,
and it's my face,

29:32.509 --> 29:34.294
but I'm not in there.

29:34.337 --> 29:37.688
- Even the positive feelings
feel like foreign.

29:39.690 --> 29:40.953
Like they're someone else's.

29:40.996 --> 29:44.391
- I don't feel happy the way
I feel happy.

29:44.434 --> 29:47.350
I don't feel sad
the way I feel sad.

29:47.394 --> 29:51.659
Everything's wrong,
and I'm just--

29:51.702 --> 29:53.704
Less.

29:53.748 --> 29:59.275
You feel like you're less.

29:59.319 --> 30:03.671
You know, the old version
of you is gone.

30:03.714 --> 30:06.892
That's true.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.416
It's okay to mourn him.

30:09.459 --> 30:13.420
He deserves it.

30:13.463 --> 30:17.946
But I am not talking to him.

30:17.990 --> 30:22.255
I'm talking to you right now.

30:22.298 --> 30:26.259
You are here,

30:26.302 --> 30:28.565
and you can't send
this new you packing

30:28.609 --> 30:32.265
because you're not
who you wish you were.

30:32.308 --> 30:34.789
You can't even make that choice
until you find out

30:34.833 --> 30:40.229
who you are now.

30:40.273 --> 30:43.929
So what do you think?

30:43.972 --> 30:46.540
You want to find out together?

30:51.806 --> 30:56.332
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.769
Coronary artery is isolated.

30:58.813 --> 31:01.424
First vein graft is ready.

31:01.468 --> 31:03.426
Vascular clamp.

31:06.734 --> 31:07.822
Do you mind if I...

31:07.866 --> 31:10.564
- Yeah, I'll connect
the anastomosis.

31:10.607 --> 31:11.739
Take a break. I got your back.

31:11.782 --> 31:14.611
Thanks.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.484
News on the cyber-attack?

31:17.527 --> 31:18.789
Still waiting on a page.

31:18.833 --> 31:19.921
Listen, I gotta talk to you
about something.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.750
- All right, you okay?
- Not really.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.057
This is harder than I thought.

31:25.100 --> 31:29.583
Floyd, I--
look, you're a good friend,

31:29.626 --> 31:30.932
so I wanted you
to hear it from me first...

31:30.976 --> 31:33.630
- Floyd, V-fib.

31:38.853 --> 31:43.423
Intra-thoracic paddles.

31:43.466 --> 31:46.295
And...wait stop.

31:46.339 --> 31:48.428
The monitor,
look at the charge.

31:48.471 --> 31:49.820
- Can't isolate
a specific current.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.518
- It's connected
to the network.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.085
You use those paddles
you'll fry his heart.

31:53.128 --> 31:56.871
- It doesn't leave us
a hell of a lot of options.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.442
- Hey, I got your page.
Tell me it's good news.

32:02.485 --> 32:05.053
- I asked HCC
for the $10 million ransom,

32:05.097 --> 32:06.489
and they are considering it.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.927
No, no. Considering it?

32:08.970 --> 32:10.972
- What can I say?
It's out of my hands.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.669
No, no. We had a deal, okay?

32:12.713 --> 32:16.456
You promised if I played ball
you would take care of this.

32:16.499 --> 32:17.936
- No.
- I did what you wanted,

32:17.979 --> 32:19.807
and you promise me that
you would take care of this.

32:19.850 --> 32:23.724
I said that I would ask them,

32:23.767 --> 32:27.423
and that is exactly what I did.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.991
But there is
some good news here.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.776
HCC is very appreciative
of the balanced budget

32:32.820 --> 32:36.084
that we both signed.

32:36.128 --> 32:38.478
Couldn't have done it
without you, Max.

32:49.706 --> 32:49.924
.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.578
- Floyd, his heart needs
a spark

32:51.621 --> 32:53.101
or this man is gonna die.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.234
- What about thermal cautery?
- Great for a vasectomy.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.279
- Yeah, but the Bovie is the
only thing that has electricity

32:57.323 --> 32:58.541
that's
not connected to the network.

32:58.585 --> 33:01.327
- Yeah, but it has
to be grounded.

33:01.370 --> 33:02.806
Wait, wait, but isn't it A.C.?

33:02.850 --> 33:04.243
Damn it.

33:04.286 --> 33:06.419
- Unless,
change it to unipolar.

33:06.462 --> 33:10.597
Cautery.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.728
You got it?

33:11.772 --> 33:14.601
Almost.

33:14.644 --> 33:15.776
Come on.

33:15.819 --> 33:17.734
- Here we go.
- All right.

33:17.778 --> 33:21.390
- All right.
- Here we go.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.697
It's just like starting
a car battery.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.395
Clear.

33:26.439 --> 33:29.442
Firing.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.400
Come on. Come on.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.841
- Come on.
Come on.

33:42.368 --> 33:43.804
We got a heartbeat.

33:43.847 --> 33:47.286
Wow. That's a new one.

33:47.329 --> 33:49.201
- All right,
let get him stabilized.

33:49.244 --> 33:51.942
Suture.

33:55.381 --> 33:56.860
You were right, you know.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.471
About what?

33:58.514 --> 34:01.517
Fuentes.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.389
She doesn't know
who she's messing with.

34:10.657 --> 34:14.008
- I never would've thought
to reverse the chemo.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.445
That was incredible.

34:16.489 --> 34:20.797
- Well, I--I have many,
many tricks to share,

34:20.841 --> 34:24.410
you know,
as your unofficial mentor.

34:24.453 --> 34:28.240
Yeah, about that,

34:28.283 --> 34:32.853
I can't tell you
how honored I am.

34:32.896 --> 34:35.290
But?

34:35.334 --> 34:36.770
- But I've been thinking
about it all day,

34:36.813 --> 34:39.512
and it would be so comfortable,

34:39.555 --> 34:43.603
so familiar, like my little
talks with Dr. Kapoor.

34:43.646 --> 34:47.041
Then he left, and it completely
knocked me off my game,

34:47.085 --> 34:50.697
and you'll be leaving too.

34:50.740 --> 34:55.223
So maybe I need to learn how
to embrace the uncomfortable.

34:55.267 --> 34:57.312
I'm the chair of neurology now,
and I need to figure out

34:57.356 --> 35:01.490
how to be that,
and I need to do it on my own.

35:06.713 --> 35:10.282
Come here.

35:10.325 --> 35:15.896
I guess maybe
I should be listening to you.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.594
- Thank you.
- Okay.

35:22.032 --> 35:23.077
Hey.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.385
- Hey, how did
it go with Angelo?

35:26.428 --> 35:27.951
- Good. You know, I think
we've been really focusing

35:27.995 --> 35:29.649
on the drugs and the PTSD,
but there's

35:29.692 --> 35:31.738
a whole identity layer
there that we can dig into.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.088
So I'm thinking art therapy,
drama obviously,

35:34.132 --> 35:35.698
maybe help him
try on some new guises,

35:35.742 --> 35:37.700
expand his sense
of himself, and--

35:37.744 --> 35:40.355
Wait. Do you hear that?

35:40.399 --> 35:42.052
No, do I hear what?

35:42.096 --> 35:43.967
- Sounds like somebody
found their music.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.411
You.

36:08.862 --> 36:11.604
- Well, Lucas may not
exactly be subtle,

36:11.647 --> 36:14.607
but he gets the job done.

36:14.650 --> 36:15.608
Schedule's done.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.000
Hey, let's hear it

36:17.044 --> 36:19.046
for the power of
your third-grade long division.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.917
A banner day.

36:20.961 --> 36:24.443
- How does your girlfriend
have a residency slot here?

36:25.531 --> 36:27.968
A fifth slot that
we never had before?

36:28.011 --> 36:32.320
- I wrote her a letter
of recommendation.

36:35.367 --> 36:38.457
That's all, and I don't
actually appreciate--

36:38.500 --> 36:41.808
- Please don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

36:43.026 --> 36:45.115
Fine, whatever.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.772
<i>- Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien </i>
to Admitting.

36:49.816 --> 36:52.688
<i>Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien </i>
to Admitting.

36:56.910 --> 36:59.652
I made a donation, okay?

36:59.695 --> 37:01.001
To the Dean's
discretion refund.

37:01.044 --> 37:03.177
There's nothing
illegal about it.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.831
It was all completely
above board.

37:04.874 --> 37:08.051
- Which is why you've been
hiding it from everyone?

37:11.707 --> 37:12.708
Does Leyla know?

37:16.146 --> 37:21.064
- No, but she doesn't need to.
- Unbelievable.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.849
- Leyla is the best resident
we've ever had here.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.938
I mean, why should it
even matter how she got here?

37:24.981 --> 37:27.680
- Because it matters.
- Casey.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.116
It's immoral.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.510
It is self-serving,
and you have completely

37:31.553 --> 37:35.688
undermined everything that
she's earned for herself.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.516
- You're right.
You're right, okay?

37:37.559 --> 37:42.172
Okay, but you get why
I had to do it. I had to.

37:42.216 --> 37:46.568
Please, please don't--
please don't say anything.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.970
- You know,
when the staff finds out,

37:57.013 --> 37:59.059
and they will find out,

37:59.102 --> 38:02.541
you're gonna lose
all their respect.

38:02.584 --> 38:06.240
Hell, you already lost mine.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.722
Casey.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.121
Great, now what?

38:28.958 --> 38:31.961
- Ah, the wire transfer just
went through,

38:32.005 --> 38:34.921
and we got a certification
of a compliance from OFAC.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.010
- No fines?
- No, and no penalties.

38:37.053 --> 38:39.969
Disco Bunny may look like
a deranged Russian Fraggle,

38:40.013 --> 38:45.497
but those bastards kept their
word, and we are back online.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.282
Most people would consider
this a win, Max.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.240
- You know,
for years I've been asking HCC

38:50.284 --> 38:53.200
for money to improve things,

38:53.243 --> 38:55.942
to make things better
for our patients,

38:55.985 --> 38:58.858
for so many things, and now
we finally get that money,

38:58.901 --> 39:01.774
and we have to hand it over
to hackers

39:01.817 --> 39:05.691
who are leveraging human life.

39:05.734 --> 39:09.564
- Well, Agent Maldonado
seems to believe

39:09.608 --> 39:13.046
that they can recover
some of the funds.

39:13.089 --> 39:16.484
- That's great. What about us?
What do we recover?

39:18.660 --> 39:22.229
- I know how difficult it was
for you to sign that budget.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.100
No, you don't.

39:26.668 --> 39:29.584
- These people are not
your friends, Max.

39:29.628 --> 39:33.719
They're your employees,
and today sacrifices

39:33.762 --> 39:35.503
were made for the greater good.

39:36.983 --> 39:39.812
Believe it or not,

39:39.855 --> 39:41.857
you did what
was best for this hospital.

39:52.825 --> 39:56.002
You wanted to see us?

39:56.045 --> 40:00.180
- I--I had to make
a tough decision today.

40:00.223 --> 40:01.877
I got backed into a corner,

40:01.921 --> 40:04.097
and I had
to let some people go...

40:11.060 --> 40:15.804
People who make this hospital
everything that it is.

40:22.332 --> 40:24.726
And you were all in that list.

40:34.736 --> 40:37.609
But I found another way.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.760
What?

41:43.413 --> 41:45.807
Is this some kind of joke?

41:45.851 --> 41:48.462
I wish it was.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.900
- How many?
How many were laid off?

41:51.944 --> 41:53.206
148.

41:53.249 --> 41:54.990
Oh, my God.

42:10.266 --> 42:15.968
- Today I protected you
from Veronica.

42:16.011 --> 42:19.362
But I can't protect you
tomorrow.
