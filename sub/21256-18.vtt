You're not talking to my wife.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.754
You have feelings for her?

00:27.789 --> 00:31.391
No, I have feelings about her.

you knew about that case law.

00:55.815 --> 00:58.081
I want to change my major to law.

01:00.453 --> 01:04.120
I know this might seem
crazy and last minute,

01:04.156 --> 01:07.525
but I realize that the reason I
was struggling so much with my art

01:07.560 --> 01:09.992
is 'cause it doesn't
come naturally to me,

01:10.028 --> 01:12.295
but fighting for justice...

01:12.330 --> 01:14.130
I know it's what I'm meant to do.

Look, it's not crazy.
It's not crazy at all,

Mm, what interview?

There's this school in Hollywood,

02:38.077 --> 02:39.511
the Musicians' Institute.

So, uh, I'm meeting the
head of the program tomorrow.

02:45.184 --> 02:46.851
That's great.

02:46.887 --> 02:48.232
Yeah, and it's all because you asked me

02:48.233 --> 02:49.565
to write the music for Ximena's video.

02:49.589 --> 02:51.822
Jesus! Come on, let's
go. Dinner's ready!

02:51.857 --> 02:53.557
Hey, where's Jude?

02:53.592 --> 02:55.526
Uh, he's having dinner
at Taylor's tonight.

02:55.561 --> 02:58.194
Anyway, um, so after L.A.
we're gonna go to Marin

02:58.230 --> 03:00.964
and stay with Grace's Mom and
then our gig is in San Fransisco.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.834
Hey, did you see the maze
that I was drawing for Emma?

03:03.869 --> 03:05.536
- On my desk?
- What's going on?

03:05.571 --> 03:07.370
Mariana ripped Emma's idea off.

03:07.406 --> 03:08.804
Uh, not true.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.574
Last I heard, she was building
a shaving cream shooting robot.

03:11.609 --> 03:14.176
Why would you need a robot
that shoots shaving cream?

03:14.211 --> 03:17.880
No, it was a prototype for shooting
fire retardant into wildfires.

03:17.916 --> 03:19.960
She was having trouble
getting the manipulator to work

03:19.984 --> 03:22.117
so that's why we came
up with the maze idea.

03:22.153 --> 03:23.497
Why does it matter
if it's the same idea?

03:23.521 --> 03:24.820
Thank you.

03:24.856 --> 03:27.756
Because Craig said that two students
applying from the same school

03:27.791 --> 03:30.091
with the same concept could
just cancel each other out.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.494
Unless one person's robot is
far superior to the other's.

Mama.

Mariana, did you steal Emma's idea?

- No!

Well, Mama and I are going

03:47.039 --> 03:49.454
to the "Harmony Soul Adventures"

03:49.478 --> 03:50.789
so thoughtfully signed us up for.

03:53.215 --> 03:54.548
Honey, we won't cancel.

- You're going to be miserable the entire time.

- It's fine.

03:59.888 --> 04:01.420
Okay, I think you guys should go.

05:25.094 --> 05:26.828
and showed us a picture of some man.

05:26.863 --> 05:28.729
They asked if they
could search our house.

05:28.764 --> 05:30.731
We didn't know they
were Immigration agents.

05:30.766 --> 05:33.267
And once they were
inside, they asked them for

05:33.303 --> 05:35.970
their immigration status.
And then arrested them.

05:36.005 --> 05:38.005
That's not right. How can they do that?

05:38.041 --> 05:40.407
ICE has been getting away
with a lot these days.

05:40.443 --> 05:44.444
So did you talk to your
lawyer about an appeal?

05:44.479 --> 05:46.880
They don't meet the
hardship requirements.

05:46.915 --> 05:49.115
Yeah, and appeals cost money.

05:49.151 --> 05:52.352
I wish... There's gotta be
something that we can do.

05:52.387 --> 05:54.721
You've meant the world

05:54.756 --> 05:55.956
all of you.

05:55.991 --> 05:58.958
We will never forget all
that you've done for us.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.828
CALLIE: So I found this case from 2008

06:02.864 --> 06:06.398
where these ICE agents were
pretending to be local police officers

06:06.433 --> 06:08.245
and they talked their way
into this woman's house

06:08.269 --> 06:11.503
using the same tactics that
ICE used with the Sinfuegos.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.673
Now even though the
woman did invite them in,

06:14.708 --> 06:18.709
the judge said because ICE
misled them so thoroughly,

06:18.745 --> 06:20.245
it rendered her consent meaningless.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.781
And because they violated her
constitutional right against

06:23.816 --> 06:25.483
warrant-less searches and seizures,

06:25.518 --> 06:28.887
he threw out the order
of removal against her.

06:28.922 --> 06:33.056
That gives the Sinfuegos a
precedence for an appeal, right?

06:33.092 --> 06:35.993
Uh... well, I think it's something.

06:36.028 --> 06:39.596
But they'd need a lawyer
willing to argue it.

06:40.966 --> 06:43.166
They said they can't
afford any more legal bills.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.338
Okay, I have an idea.

06:48.374 --> 06:50.439

for the weekend.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.437
Oh, so nice to meet you.

11:38.473 --> 11:40.005
These are for you and your husband.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.675
Oh, actually it's my wife, Stef.

11:42.710 --> 11:43.843
Hi, how are ya?

11:43.878 --> 11:45.911
We are so sorry.

11:45.946 --> 11:47.480
Oh, no, it's fine.

11:47.515 --> 11:50.549
The registration form
said Stev and Lena.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.752
I gotcha. No, my mother
signed us up for this

11:52.787 --> 11:54.497
and she probably hit the
"v" key instead of the "f."

11:54.521 --> 11:55.698
They're right next to each other.

11:55.722 --> 11:57.099
We can get another "Hers" envelope.

11:57.123 --> 11:58.234
Oh, no, no, it's no problem.

11:58.258 --> 12:00.157
- I'll be the... the man.
- You sure?

12:00.193 --> 12:01.359
That's fine.

12:01.395 --> 12:04.796
Okay. Your assignments for
the weekend are in there.

12:04.831 --> 12:07.164
Little surprises for each other.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.100
Oh! Wow, we love surprises.

12:09.135 --> 12:11.568
Don't we, honey? As long as
mine doesn't involve a penis.

12:11.604 --> 12:14.471
'Cause that would really be a surprise.

12:14.507 --> 12:16.807
BILL: No, no it doesn't.

12:16.842 --> 12:20.343
Ah... Well, then here
are some of the activities

12:20.379 --> 12:23.046
which I hope that you
will participate in.

12:23.081 --> 12:25.716
And then this afternoon,
we'll meet for group.

12:25.751 --> 12:27.418
- Sounds good!
- Thank you so much.

12:27.453 --> 12:29.184

- Thank you! We will.

What does that say?

12:31.489 --> 12:32.822
Goat Yoga?

12:32.857 --> 12:35.224
Interesting. Couples Canoing?

12:35.259 --> 12:36.492
Ooh, I'm good at canoing.

Honey, we don't have
to do any of this stuff.

12:38.062 --> 12:39.762
No this is what we are here for!

12:39.798 --> 12:41.864
I think we should try
the Goat Yoga first.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.438
wouldn't have any trouble communicating.

bouncing sound waves off the walls

you know how to do this.

it's kind of just coding.

could just adjust the sensors?

Maybe I should have used an
ultrasonic instead of infrared?

15:40.150 --> 15:41.428
Okay, why don't you just change it?

15:41.452 --> 15:43.730
Yeah, but then our robots are
going to be exactly the same.

16:12.482 --> 16:15.516
I think the case Callie found
shows good legal precedence,

16:15.551 --> 16:18.752
but it's gonna be the Sinfuegos'
word against those ICE agents.

16:18.787 --> 16:20.683
And they are not going to admit

16:20.684 --> 16:22.823
they entered that home
under false pretenses.

What if we could get an ICE agent
to testify on the Sinfuegos' behalf?

16:26.629 --> 16:27.861
Who witnessed the arrest?

16:27.897 --> 16:31.564
No, but he has knowledge
of these kinds of tactics,

16:31.599 --> 16:34.299
as well as other
inappropriate behavior by ICE.

16:34.335 --> 16:36.168
He's sort of like a whistle-blower.

Maybe he could write an amicus brief?

- CALLIE: What's that?
- It's like a person that's not directly involved with a case,

if you can find that ICE
agent and get him to cooperate,

You should, you're great at this.

17:12.538 --> 17:14.571
You get one chance to
say "I told you so."

17:14.607 --> 17:15.873
Oh, no. I wouldn't do that.

17:15.907 --> 17:18.407
Even though I did tell you so.

17:20.179 --> 17:22.111
So what about this ICE agent?

Do you really think he'll testify?

17:23.882 --> 17:25.146
I don't know.

I might need your help.

Okay, this is an exercise in partnering.

your boat across the pond,

17:35.226 --> 17:37.026

come here in the first place.

keep an open mind.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.508
Wonderful. Right this way.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.845
Hey, what... what's the point?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.291
- What?
- We don't have anything in common

19:10.315 --> 19:11.648
with these people anyway.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.818
Well, I think the point is that
maybe you should keep the open mind.

19:20.491 --> 19:21.740
They're good kids

19:22.230 --> 19:24.663
and we love them so much.

19:25.866 --> 19:28.166
But they take so much out of us.

19:28.202 --> 19:31.870
One has a learning disability
and that's been stressful.

19:31.905 --> 19:35.140
And, you know, teenagers...

19:35.175 --> 19:37.835
Uh, my wife had, I guess what you call

19:37.836 --> 19:40.200
an emotional affair with a coworker.

19:40.614 --> 19:44.415
And I guess that's made it
harder for me to trust her.

19:44.450 --> 19:48.019
I had a lot of unresolved
issues with my father.

19:48.054 --> 19:52.223
And I think it sometimes
gets in the way of my ability

19:52.258 --> 19:55.726
to be truly vulnerable and
intimate with my husband.

19:55.761 --> 19:58.496
BILL: Have you considered
confronting your father?

19:58.531 --> 20:01.297
I can't, he's dead.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.866
Is he?

20:03.902 --> 20:08.471
He's still a voice in your head, a
complication in your relationship.

20:08.507 --> 20:11.707
You know, he doesn't have to be here
for you to tell him how you feel.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.912
BETH: Would anyone else like to share?

20:17.548 --> 20:22.584
Uh, we have two kids leaving
for college... next year.

20:22.619 --> 20:26.988
And I guess what scares me is
what happens when they all leave?

20:27.991 --> 20:30.225
And it's just the two of us, again.

20:30.261 --> 20:35.196
You know, I mean we've been
co-parenting together so long,

20:35.231 --> 20:37.598
it's been the glue
that's kept us together.

20:39.569 --> 20:44.872
We can renew our vows all we
want, but if we can't connect,

20:44.907 --> 20:47.308
if we can't be vulnerable
with each other...

20:48.311 --> 20:51.744
(SIGHS) I mean, without the kids...

20:53.549 --> 20:55.582
will there by anything left between us?

21:02.023 --> 21:03.890
GRACE: You know, I'm
really proud of you.

21:03.925 --> 21:05.592

I can't do the gig.

37:45.382 --> 37:48.949
Busking on Hollywood
Boulevard was pretty cool, huh?

37:50.386 --> 37:52.319
What... You... I mean, you can...

37:52.354 --> 37:54.321
do another round of gene therapy.

37:54.356 --> 37:55.488
Right?

37:57.092 --> 37:58.558
I'm done.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.162
I don't want any more treatment.

38:05.533 --> 38:09.035
You can visit me on weekends
but you're gonna go home...

38:10.305 --> 38:12.405
and you're gonna
finish your senior year.

38:13.408 --> 38:14.773
And you're gonna graduate.

38:16.444 --> 38:19.211
And then you're gonna go
to the Musician's Institute.

38:22.749 --> 38:24.515
I don't want to leave you.

38:27.054 --> 38:28.686
You have to.

38:31.658 --> 38:33.258
There's one... (CLEARS THROAT)

38:33.259 --> 38:35.827
thing that I need you
to promise me to do.

38:37.296 --> 38:40.197
Be my proxy when the time comes.

38:42.935 --> 38:44.935
I need you to let me go.

39:50.165 --> 39:55.235
It's not that I don't... I'm just, um...

39:55.270 --> 39:58.130
I'm just not exactly
where I was with Amanda,

39:58.131 --> 40:00.450
when we almost hooked up before.

40:03.244 --> 40:04.809

I just...

40:13.921 --> 40:16.188
I can't say yes right this minute.

40:18.225 --> 40:20.258
Can I have some time to think about it?

40:20.293 --> 40:21.625
Of course.

40:30.303 --> 40:31.835
EMMA: Thanks for helping me with this.

40:31.871 --> 40:33.416

40:34.474 --> 40:35.540
Shoot.
