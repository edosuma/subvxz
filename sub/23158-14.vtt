WEBVTT

01:47.267 --> 01:49.141
Let's go.

02:17.810 --> 02:19.850
We got a pulse.

02:24.027 --> 02:26.103
Check his pressure.

02:41.134 --> 02:43.174
We better hurry back.

03:35.251 --> 03:38.253
You told me you would find her.

03:38.297 --> 03:41.215
You promised me
that you would find her.

03:42.344 --> 03:45.430
I was counting on you, Thomas.

03:59.952 --> 04:02.989
Cut that out. Don't you know
smoking stunts your growth ?

04:03.040 --> 04:06.042
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not kidding.

04:06.085 --> 04:10.548
- I'm tired of friends abusing themselves.
- You talking about me or Thomas ?

04:11.551 --> 04:13.295
TM doesn't smoke.

04:13.346 --> 04:17.641
No, TM gets shot at,
gets beat up, and goes over a cliff in a car.

04:17.685 --> 04:19.394
In whose car ?

04:20.314 --> 04:22.473
Robin's.

04:22.525 --> 04:25.361
He drove Robin's Ferrari over a cliff ?

04:25.404 --> 04:28.157
I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose.

04:29.451 --> 04:32.074
One can never be sure with Magnum.

04:33.332 --> 04:37.461
Well, he'd better survive
if he knows what's good for him.

04:40.383 --> 04:43.089
Let me have a smoke, Rick, if you will.

04:44.472 --> 04:47.843
Cigarette smoke's gonna stunt
your growth, too.

05:02.205 --> 05:06.074
Mr Magnum ? Mr Magnum ?

05:07.087 --> 05:11.550
Don't try and sit up. You've taken
a pretty nasty blow to the head.

05:24.486 --> 05:29.067
Glad to see you awake.
Hello, I'm Dr Ibold. What's your name ?

05:30.119 --> 05:32.409
- Thomas Magnum.
- Hmm-hmm.

05:32.456 --> 05:34.699
Where were you born, Mr Magnum ?

05:34.751 --> 05:36.625
- Virginia.
- When ?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.913
August 8, 1944.

05:39.925 --> 05:42.381
What's your mother's first name ?

05:42.428 --> 05:44.837
- Martha.
- All right.

05:45.766 --> 05:47.759
OK. X-rays.

05:48.687 --> 05:51.179
- Where do you live ?
- Robin's Nest.

05:51.232 --> 05:52.893
Hmm ?

05:53.652 --> 05:57.603
Robin Masters' estate. My head...

05:57.658 --> 06:01.787
You've got a severe concussion,
in addition to numerous cracked ribs

06:01.830 --> 06:05.995
a bruised hip and contused kidneys.
You're gonna be all right, though.

06:06.044 --> 06:11.503
You're looking at considerable time
and a lot of rest.

06:17.685 --> 06:20.059
Can you tell me what happened ?

06:20.940 --> 06:22.601
Well...

06:28.659 --> 06:30.403
I don't remember.

06:30.453 --> 06:33.028
Where were you
when the accident occurred ?

06:33.082 --> 06:35.075
Accident ?

06:35.126 --> 06:39.422
- You don't remember the accident ?
- No.

06:39.466 --> 06:43.168
- Do you remember driving to Waimea Bay ?
- No. Is that where it happened ?

06:43.221 --> 06:44.846
Yeah.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.929
Why don't I remember ?

06:52.275 --> 06:54.850
Do you remember anything about
the evening ?

06:54.904 --> 06:58.773
Yeah... The Gilbert's.

07:00.078 --> 07:02.404
We had dinner. It was at 7:00.

07:02.456 --> 07:06.123
- What time is it ?
- It's 3:30am.

07:06.170 --> 07:09.706
- They brought you in at what time ?
- One o'clock.

07:09.758 --> 07:14.885
What about after dinner ?
What's the last time you remember ?

07:14.932 --> 07:18.100
I don't know. 8:00, 8:30.

07:18.145 --> 07:21.100
- Nothing after that ?
- No.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.317
Well, you seem to be missing a few hours.

07:24.362 --> 07:26.189
Amnesia ?

07:26.239 --> 07:30.488
No. In cases like this, where there's been
a severe trauma to the head,

07:30.537 --> 07:33.373
temporary memory loss
is not uncommon.

07:33.416 --> 07:38.543
I'm sure those hours will return
in short order. Probably in a day or two.

07:38.590 --> 07:42.340
Meanwhile, the best thing you can do
is to get some rest.

07:42.387 --> 07:45.638
- All right ? I'll see you in the morning.
- Doctor ?

07:47.644 --> 07:52.937
- What kind of accident was it ?
- A doozy. You drove your car off a cliff.

07:58.743 --> 08:02.612
Actually, I do remember
something that might be of use to you.

08:02.665 --> 08:07.495
It was during the war, Burma. I was
the British liaison to Merrill's Marauders.

08:07.547 --> 08:10.715
One of the American chaps,
his name was Cal,

08:10.760 --> 08:15.091
was unfortunately in very close proximity
to an exploding mortar.

08:15.141 --> 08:19.140
Miraculously, his life was spared
by divine providence

08:19.188 --> 08:23.234
plus his proximity
to the underside of the Captain's Jeep.

08:23.277 --> 08:28.155
But the concussive force of the explosion
rendered him unconscious for a week.

08:28.201 --> 08:30.693
He woke
with no recollection of the incident.

08:30.746 --> 08:33.831
I managed to alleviate
his condition with the help of...

08:33.875 --> 08:37.080
I called and finally
the housekeeper told me where you were.

08:37.130 --> 08:40.001
- Are you all right ?
- An excellent question.

08:40.051 --> 08:42.458
- But now is not the best time to ask.
- It's all right.

08:42.511 --> 08:45.799
Guys, this is Wendy Gilbert
and her husband, Dave.

08:45.850 --> 08:50.431
I've been working for her father,
trying to find her sister, Joanie.

08:50.482 --> 08:52.522
I don't think I found her.

08:52.568 --> 08:55.487
- He doesn't remember a thing.
- What ?

08:55.530 --> 08:58.236
- Memory loss.
-  Amnesia ?

08:58.284 --> 09:01.702
But you said you thought
you'd be able to find her this week.

09:01.747 --> 09:04.121
Come on.
Magnum's been in an accident.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.576
- Please ?
-  'Telephone for Dr Altman.'

09:06.629 --> 09:08.587
I'm sorry.

09:08.632 --> 09:12.252
I really am sorry.
But you said you were close.

09:12.930 --> 09:16.382
At dinner,
I thought you'd come back with her.

09:16.435 --> 09:19.353
I thought I could call Daddy
and say I'd found Joanie.

09:19.397 --> 09:23.230
- I really... Oh, God.
- It's all right.

09:23.277 --> 09:26.778
Wendy... I just don't remember everything.

09:26.824 --> 09:30.075
The doctor says it'll all come back
in a few days.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.787
It's OK. We understand.
And if there's anything we can do to help...

09:33.834 --> 09:36.242
You can let him get some rest.

09:38.841 --> 09:40.918
Of course.

09:42.429 --> 09:44.339
I really am sorry, Thomas.

09:44.390 --> 09:48.472
I know that this probably happened
when you were looking for Joanie.

09:50.148 --> 09:52.272
Let's go, man.

09:53.862 --> 09:57.398
'It was a perfect day in paradise,
and I was lucky to be alive.

09:57.450 --> 09:59.942
'I was lucky to have friends who cared.

09:59.995 --> 10:03.662
'On the other hand, there was
a math teacher from Long Island

10:03.709 --> 10:06.379
'crying because her little sister's missing

10:06.421 --> 10:09.957
'and the guy who said he'd almost found her
can't remember where.

10:10.885 --> 10:15.015
'I guess the day wasn't so perfect.
And it was about to get worse.'

10:15.058 --> 10:16.719
Magnum !

10:23.361 --> 10:26.363
You're not supposed to leave your room.

10:26.407 --> 10:28.733
Come on, Higgins. I just needed some air.

10:28.785 --> 10:33.366
If you are to recuperate properly,
you must adhere to your doctor's regimen.

10:33.417 --> 10:38.211
Personally, I couldn't care less. But I am
responsible for all of Robin's guests.

10:38.257 --> 10:43.550
Even you. What if you had another
accident ? What if there were a lawsuit ?

10:43.598 --> 10:45.805
Gosh, Higgins. I didn't know you cared.

10:45.851 --> 10:48.639
Care ? Magnum, I don't care...

10:50.858 --> 10:55.652
You have a visitor. That gentleman
is from the Honolulu Police Department.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.988
He has a few questions to ask you.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.205
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:02.249 --> 11:04.408
I'm Lieutenant Tanaka.

11:05.378 --> 11:06.873
Homicide.

11:07.548 --> 11:08.793
Homicide ?

11:08.841 --> 11:11.962
A body was found this morning
in a shack at Waimea.

11:12.012 --> 11:14.849
- I thought you could tell me about it.
- Why me ?

11:14.891 --> 11:19.888
First, the victim was your client's daughter,
Joanie Green.

11:19.940 --> 11:24.189
And second,
we found this next to the body.

11:28.202 --> 11:32.283
It's a shame.
The Tigers aren't doing so hot this year.

11:43.765 --> 11:45.141
Easy, Magnum.

11:46.268 --> 11:48.677
You want to tell me about it ?

11:50.441 --> 11:52.518
Look, I wish I could.

11:54.321 --> 11:58.107
I hit my head.
I just can't remember anything.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.411
Anything after you left
Mr and Mrs Gilberts' ?

12:02.624 --> 12:05.911
- How'd you know that ?
- I talked to your doctor.

12:05.962 --> 12:11.635
- Then what are you asking me for ?
- Maybe your memory had come back.

12:15.392 --> 12:17.386
Well, it didn't.

12:18.188 --> 12:22.139
Listen.
You're a private investigator, right ?

12:22.193 --> 12:27.190
We're kind of like colleagues. You got any
ideas as to what happened at the accident ?

12:29.245 --> 12:32.247
Let me try some theories on you.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.118
You found Joanie.

12:34.794 --> 12:39.375
But you got there too soon
before the murderer was finished.

12:39.426 --> 12:43.840
Then he took off and you went after him
and wrecked up your car.

12:46.769 --> 12:49.771
Hate to think what it's gonna
cost you to fix it.

12:50.691 --> 12:54.560
That's the price you pay
for owning a fancy car.

12:54.614 --> 12:56.488
It's not my car.

12:56.533 --> 12:59.737
Anyway, that's one of my theories.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.499
It's possible.

13:04.544 --> 13:06.454
Not very pleasant.

13:08.007 --> 13:12.089
I mean, if the murderer found out
you're still alive,

13:12.138 --> 13:16.553
he might try to get to you
so you can't testify against him.

13:21.735 --> 13:26.731
Then again, there are lots of other things
that could have happened.

13:34.503 --> 13:37.125
That's what makes my job so interesting.

13:37.173 --> 13:40.460
You know, I once had a case
where this guy killed his wife.

13:40.511 --> 13:43.466
Then he bashed himself
over the head

13:43.515 --> 13:46.885
to make it look like they'd
been attacked by someone else.

13:46.937 --> 13:50.852
Lieutenant,
are you charging me with anything,

13:50.900 --> 13:55.030
or are you just trying
to rearrange my house ?

13:55.073 --> 13:58.360
You think that Sparky will re-sign Kemp ?

13:58.411 --> 14:00.321
He's got good power.

14:00.372 --> 14:02.365
Average wheels.

14:02.416 --> 14:03.995
How's yours ?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.622
What ?

14:05.671 --> 14:09.421
Are your wheels up to a little trip
to jar your memory ?

14:32.124 --> 14:34.165
Familiar ?

14:55.323 --> 14:56.949
Anything ?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.417
Sounds ?

15:08.467 --> 15:10.591
Smells ?

15:13.432 --> 15:16.600
I'd swear
I've never been here before in my life.

15:42.347 --> 15:44.555
You getting something ?

15:47.563 --> 15:49.224
No. Nothing.

15:49.274 --> 15:52.561
She was strangled. Not much of a struggle.

15:54.239 --> 15:56.398
Must have been a big guy.

16:04.128 --> 16:06.205
Nothing ?

16:07.215 --> 16:08.924
Nothing.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.345
Strike two.

16:13.766 --> 16:17.136
- The answer is no.
- Higgins, I need the car.

16:17.188 --> 16:21.139
You have already caused extensive damage
to one of Mr Masters' vehicles

16:21.193 --> 16:24.528
which insurance will not cover
because you cannot recall...

16:24.573 --> 16:27.147
My memory will come back.
The doctor said so.

16:27.201 --> 16:29.907
Until it does, you're grounded.

16:29.955 --> 16:33.160
What do I use for transportation ?
Your surf ski ?

16:33.210 --> 16:34.871
You've got the Jimmy.

16:34.921 --> 16:37.709
I can't attend to my business
in a pickup.

16:37.758 --> 16:39.835
Give me the keys. I'll use the pickup.

16:39.886 --> 16:41.546
- No.
- Why ?

16:41.597 --> 16:44.089
You're supposed to be recuperating.

16:44.142 --> 16:47.761
My client's daughter is dead
and I was at the scene.

16:47.814 --> 16:52.311
And the only thing
that comes back to me is...

16:52.362 --> 16:56.313
- some pretty weird stuff.
- An indication of your need for rest.

16:56.367 --> 16:59.784
My need...
is to put things back together.

17:00.832 --> 17:03.703
All right, Higgins ? All right.

17:03.752 --> 17:06.873
If you won't let me use the car,
I'm going to hitchhike.

17:06.924 --> 17:09.380
Now, what would Robin say if he found out

17:09.426 --> 17:12.762
that you forced an injured guest
to hitchhike ?

17:19.942 --> 17:22.647
Unless, of course, you'd like to drive me.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.110
Hi.

18:11.388 --> 18:13.382
Look...

18:15.895 --> 18:18.897
I want you to know
how sorry I am about Joanie.

18:18.941 --> 18:21.812
- Are you ?
- It's not his fault.

18:21.861 --> 18:24.151
How do we know ?
He can't remember anything.

18:24.198 --> 18:27.651
- Wendy !
- I'm sorry, all right ? I'm sorry.

18:33.836 --> 18:36.542
It's just that
Daddy loved her so much.

18:38.009 --> 18:41.842
Broke his heart when she left home.
Broke all of our hearts.

18:44.935 --> 18:48.270
She's dead.
Does anything else really matter ?

18:48.315 --> 18:52.314
- Maybe I can find out who did it.
- They've got police for that.

18:52.362 --> 18:57.156
You know, I feel pretty damn lousy about
Joanie. I also feel lousy about myself.

18:57.202 --> 19:00.288
I've got to know what happened to me
and you can help.

19:00.332 --> 19:01.957
We can ?

19:02.001 --> 19:05.952
The last thing I remember is being
with you two. 7:00, 8:00, we had dinner.

19:06.006 --> 19:10.088
- We must have talked about Joanie.
- That's all we talked about.

19:10.137 --> 19:13.388
You said you'd tracked down some leads.
You felt close.

19:13.433 --> 19:16.139
- You even had a few addresses.
- Yeah.

19:16.187 --> 19:18.975
You said you were gonna meet a contact.

19:20.151 --> 19:22.358
- Contact ?
- Yeah.

19:23.322 --> 19:27.191
- That's the word you used.
- Did I say who that contact was ?

19:27.244 --> 19:32.917
He was Hawaiian. I'm sorry, I'm not very
good at remembering their names.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.209
It ended in "oki" or "lani."
Honey ?

19:38.259 --> 19:40.586
I don't remember.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.880
Did I say where I was meeting him ?

19:42.933 --> 19:49.020
No, but we wanted to go along,
but you said you had to do it on your own.

19:49.066 --> 19:53.529
You should have let us.
Maybe if he had, she'd still be alive.

19:54.616 --> 19:56.490
Excuse me.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.423
Do you think these candy wrappers
are important ?

20:07.467 --> 20:10.385
- You'd better bring 'em.
- How much will it cost ?

20:10.429 --> 20:12.802
- It's relative.
- I found a parking stub.

20:12.849 --> 20:14.225
Relative ?

20:14.268 --> 20:17.638
A lot for a family sedan.
Normal for a high-performance vehicle.

20:17.689 --> 20:20.228
- How normal ?
- About eight.

20:20.276 --> 20:23.943
- $800 ?
- $8,000.

20:23.990 --> 20:27.111
- Couple of business cards.
- Bring them.

20:29.581 --> 20:31.989
Can't you just knock the dents out ?

20:32.043 --> 20:34.713
If you don't mind ruining the aerodynamics.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.832
For $8,000, I wouldn't mind.

20:36.883 --> 20:39.042
- I found a stopwatch.
- Bring it.

20:39.094 --> 20:42.796
Stopwatch ? That's mine.
I've been looking all over for this.

20:42.849 --> 20:45.424
I never told him he could borrow this.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.397
- How about a Swiss Army knife ?
- Yeah !

20:48.441 --> 20:51.645
Hurt or not, he has got
a lot of explaining to do.

20:52.989 --> 20:54.863
Is there a toaster in there ?

20:56.619 --> 21:00.914
- A toaster in a glove compartment ?
- Everything else of mine is in there.

21:00.958 --> 21:04.708
'Amnesia had its advantages.
When TC started yelling at me

21:04.755 --> 21:09.004
'about a few of the things
he found in the car, I just stared at him.

21:09.053 --> 21:11.212
'It worked. I think.

21:12.641 --> 21:17.720
'Anyway, two items Rick and TC found
were totally unfamiliar and so promising.

21:17.773 --> 21:20.728
'One was a parking stub
from the evening of the murder.

21:20.777 --> 21:25.156
'The other was a business card
of a curio shop proprietor named Kanoki.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.701
'So, I decided to follow up
the leads scientifically.

21:28.747 --> 21:31.453
'I flipped a coin
and tried the restaurant first.'

21:31.501 --> 21:33.577
- Good afternoon.
- How're you doing ?

21:33.628 --> 21:35.421
OK.

21:37.926 --> 21:41.462
- This one yours ?
- Sure is, bro.

21:41.514 --> 21:43.804
- Did you work Tuesday night ?
- Yeah.

21:43.851 --> 21:47.102
If there's any trouble with your car,
we got insurance.

21:47.147 --> 21:51.063
No, no. It's not that.
You remember when I came in ?

21:51.111 --> 21:53.864
I don't think so. What's this all about ?

21:54.950 --> 21:57.620
- You did see me ?
- No, I don't think so.

21:57.662 --> 22:00.997
- I was here, I've got your stub.
- So ?

22:01.042 --> 22:03.748
- Why would I have it ?
- Man, I don't know.

22:03.796 --> 22:07.248
If you're looking for an alibi
or something, I can't help you.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.258
I was driving a red Ferrari.

22:09.303 --> 22:11.047
- Red ?
- Red.

22:11.097 --> 22:16.224
Not here. I haven't seen a Ferrari since
the auto show, let alone a red one.

22:18.357 --> 22:20.850
OK, bro.

22:20.903 --> 22:22.232
Sorry.

22:27.537 --> 22:29.530
Enjoy your dinner.

22:42.182 --> 22:44.259
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

22:44.310 --> 22:50.018
I was in here Tuesday night. Would you
have a reservations list for that evening ?

22:50.068 --> 22:51.647
Uh... yes.

22:51.696 --> 22:55.066
My name's Magnum.
Thomas Magnum.

22:55.117 --> 22:57.027
I don't see you.

22:59.456 --> 23:02.542
Maybe it was in my friend's name. Kanoki.

23:03.629 --> 23:05.955
Kanoki ? No.

23:07.301 --> 23:09.543
- May I ?
- Sure.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.298
Thank you.

23:29.582 --> 23:30.958
Sir ?

23:33.796 --> 23:35.125
Sir ?

23:39.387 --> 23:40.633
Thank you.

23:42.057 --> 23:46.388
'I didn't know which was worse, the amnesia
or the sudden flashback to 'Nam.

23:46.439 --> 23:50.520
'It didn't make sense but they had to have
something to do with each other.

23:50.569 --> 23:52.693
'At least I hoped they did.

23:52.739 --> 23:55.409
'To make matters worse,
I was getting paranoid.

23:55.451 --> 23:58.157
'Either that
or someone was following me.

24:15.855 --> 24:19.521
'Lf there's one thing I'm really good at,
it's nailing a tail.

24:21.112 --> 24:23.900
'See, first I make like I'm trying to rabbit.

24:27.788 --> 24:32.250
'Then I look for an inconspicuous
hiding place and duck into it.

24:38.457 --> 24:40.700
'And wait. It always works.

25:06.257 --> 25:10.387
'I was beginning to get a little scared.
The business card from Haloka Antiques

25:10.430 --> 25:13.301
'was my last link
to whatever happened that night.

25:13.350 --> 25:16.103
'I hoped it was more tangible
than the parking stub

25:16.146 --> 25:18.720
'from the Crouching Lion Restaurant.'

25:41.807 --> 25:44.263
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.889
Is Mr Kanoki here ?

25:47.940 --> 25:50.017
- May I help you ?
- No, it's personal.

25:50.068 --> 25:53.106
He was gonna show me
some special scrimshaw.

25:54.157 --> 25:55.782
Mr Kanoki ?

25:57.245 --> 26:01.707
- Yeah, I talked to him Tuesday.
- On the phone ?

26:01.751 --> 26:02.997
Yeah.

26:03.045 --> 26:06.581
He's been away on a buying trip
in Australia the last month.

26:09.262 --> 26:10.922
Perhaps it was someone else.

26:10.972 --> 26:14.473
Mr Blackmore's been taking clients.
He'll be back soon.

26:14.519 --> 26:17.272
Would he have given me
Mr Kanoki's card ?

26:17.314 --> 26:22.228
Everyone has their own cards.
We don't pencil people in at Haloka Curios.

26:22.947 --> 26:24.941
No. Of course not.

26:26.035 --> 26:27.862
Bye.

26:36.341 --> 26:40.210
'A restaurant I'd never been in.
A curio dealer I'd never met.

26:40.263 --> 26:44.132
'Places I'd never seen. The only reality
was Joanie Green was dead.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.846
'I had amnesia.

26:49.401 --> 26:51.975
'And I was feeling paranoid again.'

27:19.234 --> 27:21.808
Get out of the car. Real slow.

27:23.490 --> 27:26.445
- Boy, what a ride !
- Tanaka.

27:26.494 --> 27:29.662
You remember me. That's good.

27:32.586 --> 27:37.131
Hey, you know, Detroit lost a twin bill to KC.

27:37.176 --> 27:39.632
You were on my tail last night. Why ?

27:39.679 --> 27:42.302
I'm working on a homicide, Magnum.

27:42.350 --> 27:45.636
A homicide that one way or another
involves you.

27:45.688 --> 27:48.606
And I'm getting a lot of hassle
from downtown.

27:48.650 --> 27:53.397
Mainland schoolteacher killed.
Not good for the tourist trade.

27:53.448 --> 27:59.156
So they want me to make an arrest.
They think you're a likely candidate.

27:59.206 --> 28:03.206
So tell me about last night.
You know, the restaurant.

28:03.254 --> 28:08.712
And after you're finished with that,
what were you doing in that curio shop ?

28:08.761 --> 28:13.259
Why did you tail me ? Why didn't you
ask me ? You would've got better results.

28:13.309 --> 28:15.137
If you're innocent, yeah.

28:16.314 --> 28:18.307
But if you're not...

28:22.656 --> 28:24.199
OK.

28:24.241 --> 28:27.279
I found a parking stub in my car
from that restaurant.

28:27.329 --> 28:30.746
- They tell you anything ?
- That I'd never been there.

28:30.792 --> 28:36.001
Same with the business card from the shop.
The guy's been in Australia for a month.

28:36.049 --> 28:40.049
So no one knows where you were
Tuesday night when Joanie was killed ?

28:40.097 --> 28:44.096
Look, you think I killed Joanie,
that all this is just a cover-up ?

28:45.438 --> 28:47.930
I didn't say that.

28:47.983 --> 28:50.985
But now that you mention it, it's a theory.

28:52.239 --> 28:55.739
And like I said,
a real popular one downtown.

28:57.204 --> 29:00.159
- You hear about Fidrych ?
- Yeah.

29:00.208 --> 29:04.457
Detroit cut him.
I remember his good year.

29:04.506 --> 29:08.090
Remember that first year he came up ?

29:08.136 --> 29:12.965
Everything was magic.
He used to talk to that ball.

29:13.018 --> 29:17.562
Some people thought he was crazy. Not me.

29:17.607 --> 29:19.399
I think I understood.

29:20.528 --> 29:24.658
Then he got hurt.
Just never could come back.

29:26.536 --> 29:28.660
I hope you have better luck, Magnum.

29:34.631 --> 29:38.465
'Tanaka said what I'd been thinking.
I just hadn't wanted to admit it.

29:42.475 --> 29:45.050
'I'd run down all the leads and struck out.

29:45.104 --> 29:49.020
'Contrary to what the doctor said,
I was afraid the more time that went by

29:49.068 --> 29:54.064
'the less chance I had of ever finding out
what happened on that cliff. Or why.'

29:57.621 --> 30:02.665
Ah, Magnum. Back in one piece, I see.

30:04.047 --> 30:07.252
And more importantly, so is the car.

30:08.178 --> 30:11.844
- You were waiting for me.
- I was not. I was checking the latch

30:11.891 --> 30:15.593
when I heard the sound of your motor.
Naturally I was curious

30:15.647 --> 30:19.812
- to see if the car was back in one piece.
- You were waiting for me.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.404
You care.

30:22.406 --> 30:26.986
- Have you found anything out ?
- No.

30:27.037 --> 30:32.200
The insurance company has informed me
there is no precedent for amnesia.

30:32.253 --> 30:34.412
If you don't recall, they can't pay.

30:34.464 --> 30:39.045
What do you want me to do ?
I'm trying. I just can't remember.

30:39.096 --> 30:43.641
- That's what Cal said.
- What ? Cal ?

30:43.686 --> 30:48.100
The one who had amnesia
with the Desert Rats in North Africa.

30:48.150 --> 30:52.648
Merrill's Marauders in Burma. The only thing
you've got right is it was amnesia.

30:52.698 --> 30:57.196
- That figures. What's the point ?
- The point is I brought his memory back.

30:58.331 --> 31:01.535
- You mean it ? How ?
- Yes.

31:02.378 --> 31:04.455
Now...

31:05.383 --> 31:07.875
Concentrate on this.

31:07.928 --> 31:11.049
- Ten.
- Higgins, this is not going to work.

31:11.099 --> 31:14.552
It will work. Concentrate. Nine.

31:14.604 --> 31:16.930
- Eight.
- Higgins, do you have to use that ?

31:16.982 --> 31:19.521
It is straight out of Bela Lugosi.

31:19.569 --> 31:21.562
Concentrate.

31:24.451 --> 31:26.243
Seven.

31:28.081 --> 31:29.825
Six.

31:32.212 --> 31:33.956
Five.

31:35.925 --> 31:37.717
Four.

31:39.388 --> 31:41.797
Your body is quite relaxed.

31:43.519 --> 31:45.393
Three.

31:46.356 --> 31:51.400
Your limbs feel very heavy now
as if they were made of stone.

31:53.408 --> 31:55.401
Two.

31:56.120 --> 32:01.199
Your eyelids are getting heavier.
You can barely keep them open.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.171
One.

32:06.176 --> 32:08.549
The relaxation is complete.

32:09.847 --> 32:12.422
And your eyelids close.

32:18.943 --> 32:23.654
You are conscious
and you are very, very relaxed.

32:24.701 --> 32:26.944
The sensation is pleasant.

32:27.497 --> 32:31.627
We are going to recall,
in as much detail as possible,

32:31.669 --> 32:33.829
the events
that occurred Tuesday evening.

32:33.881 --> 32:36.289
We'll start at 6:00 pm.

32:36.343 --> 32:38.965
What is the first thing you did ?

32:40.056 --> 32:45.812
Shaved. Got dressed. Sneaked into the wine
cellar and borrowed a very nice Bordeaux.

32:46.649 --> 32:51.776
- There's a new lock on the wine cellar.
- Hancock, Model 17, double hitch hasp.

32:51.822 --> 32:53.567
I have a special pick for it.

32:56.204 --> 32:59.704
The Bordeaux.
The Chateau and vintage ?

32:59.750 --> 33:02.421
Chateau Marceau, 1966.

33:06.802 --> 33:09.554
And where did you take this wine ?

33:09.597 --> 33:13.015
- To the Gilberts'. We had dinner.
- Where ?

33:13.060 --> 33:18.353
At the condo.
She's a very good cook. It runs in the family.

33:18.401 --> 33:20.395
There we go.

33:20.446 --> 33:23.401
In Bay Shore,
my family is famous for this.

33:23.450 --> 33:26.867
My father is the scampi king
of the Eastern Seaboard.

33:27.914 --> 33:30.453
- What do you think ?
- That's terrific.

33:30.501 --> 33:32.495
- Good.
- You know...

33:33.881 --> 33:38.011
I don't think I've ever had
a client cook for me before.

33:38.054 --> 33:41.009
Better make the best
out of a lousy situation.

33:41.058 --> 33:44.891
In fact, here's to finding Joanie.

33:52.699 --> 33:54.324
Joanie.

33:54.368 --> 33:55.993
Poor Joanie.

33:57.289 --> 33:59.828
She doesn't belong here, you know.

34:00.585 --> 34:03.042
She was a teacher, like me.

34:05.091 --> 34:09.422
In the fall, the leaves would turn brown
and the kids would come to class.

34:09.472 --> 34:13.472
In the spring, the leaves would all
turn green and the kids would be gone.

34:14.605 --> 34:17.726
Year after year, it was the same cycle.

34:19.737 --> 34:23.985
She wanted to break that.
She did. She said that...

34:25.286 --> 34:27.659
She said that...

34:27.706 --> 34:33.462
she wanted to spend summer...
Iooking for paradise.

34:36.802 --> 34:40.007
Honey, it's OK. We'll find her.

34:47.275 --> 34:50.360
- What time did you leave ?
- I don't know.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.833
What is the last moment
you do remember ?

35:02.880 --> 35:05.882
- Sitting at the table.
- What exactly were you doing ?

35:13.270 --> 35:15.892
- What is it ?
- It's a man with a gun.

35:15.940 --> 35:17.814
- What ?
- VC.

35:19.528 --> 35:20.643
No.

35:20.697 --> 35:24.566
Let the memory come. It can't hurt you.
What do you see ?

36:14.814 --> 36:16.522
Nol

36:19.320 --> 36:22.406
Nol Nol

36:22.449 --> 36:27.612
It's fading, all fading away. The image is
gone. In its place, you see a snowfield.

36:27.665 --> 36:32.827
Soft, white flakes drifting down.
Peace. Peace.

36:32.881 --> 36:35.123
And tranquillity.

36:35.175 --> 36:38.178
Pure, white snow.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.940
I'm going to count to three.

36:50.238 --> 36:55.235
When I reach three you will be
completely awake and feel quite relaxed.

36:55.287 --> 36:59.416
Even your ribs won't hurt.
You will remember everything you saw.

37:01.295 --> 37:05.425
Everything except the incident
in the wine cellar. Prepare to awake.

37:06.803 --> 37:08.132
One...

37:08.847 --> 37:10.556
two...

37:10.600 --> 37:12.308
three.

37:17.359 --> 37:20.231
It's very odd, Magnum. Very odd indeed.

37:31.295 --> 37:32.920
Here.

37:37.262 --> 37:40.217
We can't seem to take you
any closer to the trauma

37:40.266 --> 37:42.224
than dinner at the Gilberts'.

37:43.562 --> 37:48.392
You know, Magnum, your amnesia
may not be entirely physical.

37:48.444 --> 37:50.901
There can be emotional reasons...

37:50.948 --> 37:54.817
- Come on, Higgins. Hysterical amnesia ?
- It's not so preposterous.

37:54.870 --> 37:59.949
Perhaps something happened that
you don't want to remember, Vietnam.

38:00.002 --> 38:01.794
It isn't delayed stress.

38:01.838 --> 38:06.252
- Why the Vietnam memory ?
- It isn't a memory. It's a dream.

38:10.600 --> 38:15.644
It's a dream I had ten years ago. It's
a recurring nightmare. It never happened.

38:22.340 --> 38:25.046
'My session with Higgins,
like everything else,

38:25.094 --> 38:27.716
'left me with more questions than answers.

38:27.764 --> 38:31.763
'But for the first time since I woke up,
I felt the answer was there,

38:31.811 --> 38:35.098
'somewhere in the corner of my mind,
ready to pop out.

38:35.149 --> 38:38.021
'It might have if Higgins
would've given me a break.'

38:38.070 --> 38:42.235
Don't imagine for a moment
that this relieves you of responsibility.

38:42.284 --> 38:45.868
- This arrangement is only temporary.
- I know that, Higgins.

38:45.914 --> 38:50.044
If your memory does not return sufficiently
to satisfy the claim adjuster,

38:50.087 --> 38:53.623
- this is coming out of your pocket.
- I know that, Higgins.

38:53.675 --> 38:57.425
- And for God's sake, drive carefully.
- Yes, Higgins.

38:57.472 --> 39:01.471
'Salesman to the front desk,
please. Salesman to the front.'

39:01.519 --> 39:03.560
- Keys are in it.
- Thanks.

39:15.289 --> 39:18.624
Wouldn't hurt so much
if you didn't drive so fast.

39:27.556 --> 39:30.262
Maybe I didn't. Wait a minute.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.014
Yeah ?

39:33.063 --> 39:38.142
- Has anybody driven this since it came in ?
- You kidding ? Robin Masters' Ferrari ?

39:38.196 --> 39:41.946
We just worked on the outside.
Something the matter ?

39:42.785 --> 39:45.111
No. Thank you.

39:51.631 --> 39:54.882
Yo, Thomas !
I've been looking all over for you.

39:54.927 --> 39:56.256
Hi, Rick.

39:56.304 --> 40:00.553
Thomas, I ran that check for you
and it cost me a couple of favours.

40:00.602 --> 40:03.272
- And about 50 bucks in phone calls.
- Rick...

40:03.314 --> 40:06.269
Have I got a surprise
about your client's daughter ?

40:06.318 --> 40:08.644
- Which one ?
- The one that's alive. Wendy.

40:08.696 --> 40:12.281
She didn't get along
with her father too well.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.284
She was always in trouble, see.

40:14.329 --> 40:18.079
The capper came down when she wanted
to marry that tall guy.

40:18.126 --> 40:22.042
- Dave.
- He did time for security fraud.

40:22.090 --> 40:26.670
The old man said nothing doing.
She goes and marries him anyway.

40:26.722 --> 40:28.845
The old man cut her out of the will.

40:28.891 --> 40:33.222
The way I look at it, that's a lot of scampi
money she's not gonna see. Right ?

40:33.272 --> 40:35.396
You sure about this, Rick ?

40:35.442 --> 40:39.144
Why come to me in the first place
if you question what I give you ?

40:39.197 --> 40:41.903
Because if you're right, it's a motive.

40:41.951 --> 40:45.156
A motive ? To knock off her own sister ?
Come on, no way.

40:45.206 --> 40:50.202
If she's out of the will, she's out of the will.
Her sister dying doesn't change anything.

40:50.254 --> 40:53.422
Maybe not. Thanks, Rick.

40:53.467 --> 40:56.920
- "Thanks, Rick." That's it ?
- I'm sorry. Thanks a lot.

41:07.278 --> 41:09.735
Thank you. Thanks.

41:09.782 --> 41:11.241
I'm sorry.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.327
I'm sorry. No, none for me.

41:15.373 --> 41:19.372
I tried. I hope your father understands.
I really tried.

41:19.420 --> 41:21.877
We know that, Magnum. Still nothing ?

41:23.467 --> 41:26.588
- Nothing.
- It hasn't been long since the accident.

41:26.638 --> 41:29.759
- Your memory will come back.
- I don't think so.

41:30.853 --> 41:35.148
See, nothing's come back.
Nothing at all.

41:35.192 --> 41:40.105
Except this nightmare that I had
in Nam about being helpless.

41:41.451 --> 41:44.322
That sounds awful.

41:46.249 --> 41:48.539
Well, it is.

41:48.586 --> 41:53.000
The way I figure it, something must have
happened that made me feel helpless

41:53.050 --> 41:55.257
and triggered this old nightmare.

41:55.303 --> 41:58.056
Makes sense.
Maybe being trapped in the car.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.973
Maybe.

42:00.018 --> 42:04.599
But see, then I got this other idea.

42:04.650 --> 42:08.435
I mean,
what if I didn't have amnesia at all ?

42:10.825 --> 42:12.949
I don't understand that.

42:14.413 --> 42:18.199
What if I didn't lose those three hours ?
What if I didn't lose 'em ?

42:18.252 --> 42:24.174
I mean, the last thing I remember
was being here and sipping wine

42:24.219 --> 42:26.046
with the two of you.

42:26.096 --> 42:27.888
It's kind of like now.

42:27.932 --> 42:34.768
Only that night I drank my wine
and as I recall...

42:37.070 --> 42:40.274
- you didn't drink yours.
- Of course we did.

42:41.576 --> 42:44.282
It's kind of the reverse of now.

42:44.330 --> 42:46.489
I mean, I'm not drinking.

42:48.252 --> 42:50.578
But you are.

42:53.092 --> 42:56.297
- You drugged the wine ?
- No.

42:58.057 --> 43:02.139
Actually, poison is a better word for it.

43:02.647 --> 43:06.017
See, it's this stuff they used
to use on prisoners in Nam.

43:06.069 --> 43:09.237
If we didn't talk,
they wouldn't give us the antidote.

43:10.199 --> 43:12.656
That's murder, Magnum, and I'm...

43:13.621 --> 43:17.952
Now, Dave. It is only murder
if I don't give you the antidote

43:18.002 --> 43:21.704
in about, ooh, five minutes.

43:22.758 --> 43:25.511
The convulsions are the worst part.

43:25.554 --> 43:28.128
- You killed Joanie.
- Ooh !

43:28.183 --> 43:32.134
That's very nicely played.
Very nicely played indeed.

43:32.188 --> 43:38.110
As a matter of fact, this whole thing
has been very nicely played.

43:38.155 --> 43:42.783
You killed Joanie,
but then you made it look like I was involved.

43:42.828 --> 43:47.159
Not too obvious.
Not too much evidence against me.

43:47.209 --> 43:52.502
But eventually... eventually, the police
were gonna have to pin it on me

43:52.550 --> 43:55.469
because you see,
those missing three hours

43:55.512 --> 43:58.087
were gonna bug them
as much as it bugged me.

43:58.141 --> 44:03.101
You drugged me. You drove me out to
Waimea. You pushed the car over the cliff.

44:03.148 --> 44:05.058
No...

44:05.109 --> 44:08.111
Well, if you didn't, Dave,

44:08.155 --> 44:10.730
it was somebody as big as you.

44:10.784 --> 44:16.824
See, I had to adjust the seat forward

44:16.876 --> 44:20.578
when I picked up my car.
Now, I don't usually have to do that.

44:24.219 --> 44:29.808
See, the way I figure it is you found Joanie
before I did. And you killed her.

44:30.436 --> 44:35.978
I guess you just figured it was easier to get
back into Daddy's will with her gone.

44:36.027 --> 44:39.029
A tearful reconciliation at Joanie's funeral.

44:39.073 --> 44:43.072
- Filling a void in Daddy's life.
- You are crazy...

44:45.541 --> 44:49.326
You know, Wendy,
that's exactly what you had me thinking.

44:49.379 --> 44:53.331
You played me very well.
Some lousy PI to use and throw away.

44:53.760 --> 44:59.682
- You can't prove any of this.
- No, Dave. I can't. But you can.

45:03.107 --> 45:05.480
Come on in, it's open.

45:08.239 --> 45:10.695
How are you doing, Lieutenant ?

45:12.161 --> 45:14.534
Hey, the Tigers win last night ?

45:15.457 --> 45:17.000
Help me, please.

45:17.043 --> 45:22.039
Lieutenant, he killed Joanie
and he just poisoned us.

45:22.091 --> 45:24.844
You call me here to kill me too ?

45:24.887 --> 45:26.880
No. No.

45:26.932 --> 45:29.008
To hear a confession.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.768
Oh...

45:31.813 --> 45:33.771
Three minutes.

45:38.197 --> 45:40.820
It was Wendy's idea.

46:11.535 --> 46:14.537
Hey. King Kamehameha.

46:14.581 --> 46:15.744
Hey !

46:15.791 --> 46:19.078
How are you doing ? How's our two killers ?

46:19.129 --> 46:24.256
Well, aside from
some lower intestinal misery, OK.

46:24.303 --> 46:27.258
At least as OK as you can be
with murder one charges.

46:27.307 --> 46:29.265
Yeah...

46:29.310 --> 46:31.600
They want the DA
to bring charges against you.

46:31.647 --> 46:33.141
For what ?

46:33.191 --> 46:37.771
Even if that stuff wasn't lethal,
it made them pretty sick.

46:40.367 --> 46:43.203
But they can't prove anything
without a witness.

46:44.289 --> 46:46.081
- A witness ?
- Yeah.

46:46.125 --> 46:49.578
You know,
a neutral third party that could testify

46:49.630 --> 46:52.751
he thought he saw you spike their wine.

46:52.801 --> 46:54.925
You know anybody like that ?

46:56.580 --> 46:58.241
Nope.

46:59.394 --> 47:03.523
- That's bribery, you know.
- That's right.

47:03.566 --> 47:06.105
- See you around, Magnum.
- OK.

47:15.750 --> 47:19.416
Are you starting some sort of fan club ?

47:19.463 --> 47:22.038
Why ? Would you like to join ?

47:22.092 --> 47:25.260
No. I would like payment for...

47:25.305 --> 47:28.889
No, Dave pushed the car off the cliff.

47:28.935 --> 47:33.978
For the bottle of Chateau Marceau, 1966,
which you pilfered from the wine cellar.

47:34.818 --> 47:38.319
A bottle of wine ?
What makes you think I took it ?

47:38.365 --> 47:40.821
You recounted the deed
while under hypnosis.

47:40.868 --> 47:43.787
What ? What ?

47:43.831 --> 47:50.417
Higgins, I'm ashamed of you. I mean, that's
a violation of patient-doctor confidentiality,

47:50.465 --> 47:53.039
or conflict of interests or something.

47:53.094 --> 47:57.342
- Replacing the bottle will cost $54.50.
- Higgins !

47:57.391 --> 48:00.808
Plus tax.
I would prefer cash if you don't mind.

48:00.854 --> 48:02.230
Aw, Higgins !

48:02.273 --> 48:06.189
Or I shall use some of
the other things you told me.

48:09.241 --> 48:11.281
Other things ?

48:15.917 --> 48:18.456
How about a cheque ?
