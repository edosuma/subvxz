00:42.560 --> 00:44.539
(Jaunty fiddle music)

00:46.560 --> 00:48.824
(Whooping)

01:00.200 --> 01:01.827
(Music stops)

01:06.120 --> 01:07.382
Evening.

01:07.560 --> 01:11.382
- Salute your new grave-digger!
- Would that not be grave-robber?

01:11.560 --> 01:16.862
(Chuckles) Speak no ill 0' the livin'.
'Specially afore their own flesh 'n blood.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.385
Yes, sur, daughter of 'im.
Though I hope I take not after 'im!

01:20.560 --> 01:22.744
THOLLY: Chance'd be a fine thing!

01:23.960 --> 01:28.181
- Do 'ee not dance?
- The Lord do consider it sinful.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.627
Oh, well, the Lord do sound a proper spoilsport!
(Chuckles)

01:33.800 --> 01:38.624
- What's the occasion?
- First harvest 0' the land gifted by Cap'n Ross.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.940
Givin' away yer own acreage? Are 'ee mad?

01:42.120 --> 01:45.100
If so, 'tis a madness sent by the Lord
in whom we trust.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.383
(Groans)

01:46.560 --> 01:49.347
Trust Ross. You'll get a better return.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.181
True.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.461
(Laughter)

01:56.640 --> 01:57.743
Whoo!

02:06.440 --> 02:08.021
(Locks door)

02:08.200 --> 02:09.588
(Keys jangle)

02:11.400 --> 02:13.823
We must stiffen security at all our grain stores.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.141
These types would have no compunction
about feeding their faces at my expense.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.623
Sir Francis!

02:21.800 --> 02:24.746
Ah. I assume you've heard the news?

02:24.920 --> 02:26.865
My elevation to the rank of Burgess.

02:28.040 --> 02:32.022
I assume you 1/9
not
heard the news.
Sir Piers Arthur is dead.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.462
Most distressing.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.504
And the best news I've had all year.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.905
Enough, wife.
You must know the book of prayer by heart now!

03:02.840 --> 03:05.786
Is it not my duty to set an example
to your daughters?

03:05.960 --> 03:09.384
You have a duty to your husband,
which at present is more pressing.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.906
Go and join your sister.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.701
I wish Drake and Sam would find contentment.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.942
Have you found it?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.666
In this moment, I have.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.701
I wish it may last.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.200
100 years old next week!

04:42.360 --> 04:48.549
You call this Flemish lace?
I look like a desiccated bat! Mind that pin!

04:49.560 --> 04:53.542
- I don't wish to be bled like a stuck pig!
- Sorry, ma'am.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.099
Add these names to the list: George Venables,

04:57.280 --> 05:00.306
Laurence Trevemper,

05:00.480 --> 05:02.903
Randolph Pentire.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.378
They're dead, Aunt. Remember?

05:06.560 --> 05:08.585
Let me see. Who's coming, then?

05:11.600 --> 05:14.945
Trevaunance? Bodrugan?

05:16.360 --> 05:19.864
Poldarks. That's better! People I actually like!

05:24.760 --> 05:26.466
I will not have that man in my house.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.040
In fairness, it's Agatha's house too.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.864
Surely, on her 100th birthday,
we can grant her this one small request?

05:35.040 --> 05:38.544
By hosting a frivolous event
which delivers to us no personal benefit?

05:38.720 --> 05:40.506
What benefit should we seek?

05:40.680 --> 05:43.387
AUNT AGATHA: I want a new jet choker!

05:43.560 --> 05:46.825
At least the Penvenen wedding
will provide opportunity.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.388
For what?

05:48.560 --> 05:51.142
For me to further my acquaintance
with Lord Falmouth.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.226
Sir Piers Arthur is dead.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.260
Truro lacks an MP.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.385
And the man who instructs the burgesses
to vote for his candidate of choice?

06:01.560 --> 06:02.948
Lord Falmouth.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.419
(Squawking)

06:33.240 --> 06:35.219
(They chuckle)

06:56.320 --> 06:58.299
(Dialogue indistinct)

07:10.480 --> 07:16.419
- I fear Drake still hankers for Morvvenna.
- I rue the day she ever crossed his path.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.702
For giving George the chance
to injure you through them?

07:19.880 --> 07:21.939
And to think I attempted to negotiate with him!

07:22.120 --> 07:28.377
Well, those days are over. No more
"playing the game, no more seeking terms.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.585
As for Drake, I've been making enquiries.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.580
And?

07:35.960 --> 07:40.385
The old smith died last month.
It has a cottage, a stable...

07:41.560 --> 07:43.266
...and some land besides.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.660
And you have some skill in smithying,
you're a quick learner.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.899
And not a farthin' to my name.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.468
It's yours.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.828
Already purchased.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.386
No, brother, it is too much.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.664
I like indebtedness no more than you.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.461
You saved my life in France.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.899
The obligation is now discharged.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.620
It's so quiet here without Geoffrey Charles.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.301
(Valentine cries)

08:31.480 --> 08:36.019
- Happily, Valentine makes up for his absence.
- Not happily, so it seems.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.778
I'm not at all convinced
by Dr Choake's treatment.

08:39.960 --> 08:44.340
Darkened rooms, legs in splints,
odious tinctures which make him vomit.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.499
I confess, his recovery is taking longer
than was promised.

08:48.680 --> 08:52.184
You should dispense with Choake altogether.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.907
And do what?

08:58.920 --> 09:01.627
Elizabeth Warleggan
requests me to attend on her son.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.301
Will you?

09:03.480 --> 09:07.428
Since I cannot yet return to sea,
I can at least make myself useful on land.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.945
I know what I'd advise.
Get rid of the splints and the swaddling

09:16.120 --> 09:17.382
and put him out in the fresh air.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.859
- Dr Enys does not subscribe to old wives' tales.
- In this case he does.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.579
Splints and swaddling have no efficacy,
and rickets is exacerbated by lack of light.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.858
Give him plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables,
mother's milk and sunlight.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.146
- You will see an improvement within days.
- So no tinctures, powders?

09:33.320 --> 09:34.389
Dr Choake prescribed...

09:34.560 --> 09:37.939
Dr Choake's prescriptions often serve his purse
rather than his patients.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.259
So my son will not be deformed?

09:42.760 --> 09:45.820
Follow my instructions
and you have every reason to be hopeful.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.977
So, your dire predictions were unfounded.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.746
He was born under a black moon.

09:57.440 --> 10:01.103
He may avoid rickets
but he cannot escape his parentage.

10:01.280 --> 10:06.058
I should know,
I've been on this earth for nigh on a century.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.945
So, husband dear,
shall we depart for our wedding?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.025
You've been petitioning the Admiralty again?

10:33.200 --> 10:35.259
No. Why would I?

10:35.440 --> 10:39.661
I'm considered unfit to resume my duties, as yet.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.186
For your sake, I'm sorry.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.146
Don't be.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.982
I dare say I can bear to convalesce here
a while longer.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.504
May I escort you to church, Miss Penvenen?

10:51.680 --> 10:54.786
Finally we may end our pretence of courtship.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.337
Pray do, Dr Enys.

11:21.440 --> 11:25.547
I think, wife, before the reception,
I shall avail myself.

11:28.280 --> 11:32.341
No, I beg you. I'm not recovered from last night.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.783
Don't make me strike you! So help me, I will!

12:02.600 --> 12:05.023
In the words of St Paul,

12:05.200 --> 12:12.265
"Wives, submit yourselves unto your husbands
as unto the Lord."

12:20.520 --> 12:22.260
- Gentlemen.
- Good day to you.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.749
ANNOUNCER: And Lieutenant Rosewall.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.420
ANNOUNCER:
Captain Poldark and Mistress Poldark.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.501
Dwight Enys.
I never thought I'd see the day.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.919
ANNOUNCER: Mr and Mrs Charles Tragoine.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.859
(indistinct chatter)

12:48.360 --> 12:50.100
(Laughter)

12:57.080 --> 12:59.787
She do bless you daily for bringin' him home.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.425
ANNOUNCER: The Reverend
Osbourne Whitworth and Mrs Whitworth.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.784
(Low conversation)

13:06.960 --> 13:08.177
Morvvenna looks pale.

13:08.360 --> 13:12.785
- Doubtless the brat is making her nauseous.
- Or possibly her husband.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.622
ANNOUNCER: Lord Falmouth and Mrs Gower.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.379
- Congratulations, my dear.
- Thank you.

13:23.560 --> 13:28.862
To wield such power.
And my conduit to Parliament.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.702
Come, my dear, let us not pretend
we would not enjoy like status.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.700
ANNOUNCER: Mr and Mrs Lilycoat.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.199
My Lord Falmouth.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.420
My lords, ladies and gentlemen. Forgive me.

13:42.600 --> 13:47.060
I promise to be brief in my words
but profuse in my thanks.

13:47.240 --> 13:50.585
To Caroline,
for making me the happiest of men.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.103
To all of you, for joining our festivities.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.067
But above all, to one man

13:56.240 --> 13:59.789
to whom it is entirely due that Caroline and I
stand here today as man and wife.

14:00.800 --> 14:06.864
May I ask you to raise your glasses
to the noblest, bravest man I've ever known.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.261
- Captain Ross Poldark!
- Captain Ross Poldark!

14:15.680 --> 14:20.424
If you'll permit me? Just a few words.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.501
Saving your blushes, Captain Poldark,

14:24.680 --> 14:28.025
but I too must express gratitude
to the Hero of Quimper.

14:28.200 --> 14:33.103
For saving my nephew,
Lieutenant Hugh Armitage.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.822
I second that.

14:37.520 --> 14:41.399
- The Hero of Quimper!
- The Hero of Quimper!

14:42.960 --> 14:44.279
(Music starts)

14:56.720 --> 14:59.063
My Lord, may I present my wife, Demelza?

14:59.240 --> 15:01.982
Your husband is a reluctant hero, ma'am.

15:02.160 --> 15:06.585
Yet he cannot avoid the_fame
attaching to hIS explorts.

15:06.760 --> 15:10.105
I hope it will not go to his head
and induce him to embark on another.

15:11.080 --> 15:15.665
It is a novelty to find a wife
so eager to keep her husband at home.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.502
But England may yet have need of him.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.901
Then, sir, I believe neither of us will be lacking.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.423
You must come and visit us sometime.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.188
Thank you.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.981
You see what I'm up against?

15:33.160 --> 15:35.424
The man is a braggart, his wife is a trull.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.261
This whole event is a waste of time.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.305
You're no admirer of Lord Falmouth?

15:39.480 --> 15:43.302
What man of principle could be?
Not content with running half of Cornwall,

15:43.480 --> 15:44.742
he must also be Lord of Truro.

15:44.920 --> 15:48.265
How can it be that the corporation
is treated as a rich man's chattel?

15:48.440 --> 15:52.422
- Does it not make you all a laughing stock?
- It does.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.819
Hence the growing discontent
among the burgesses.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.187
And yet my experience in France has taught me
that discontent alone is no solution.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.703
Unless a worthy alternative is offered.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.098
- A worthy politician?
- Is there such a thing?

16:05.280 --> 16:09.307
SIR FRANCIS: Change will not be easy,
particularly while Falmouth holds sway,

16:09.480 --> 16:11.857
nor its advocates popular.

16:12.040 --> 16:17.057
- But you believe the right candidate exists?
- I've made it my mission to find him.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.028
(Music plays)

16:38.320 --> 16:41.141
You not dancing, sir?
Or do your prefer observing?

16:41.320 --> 16:45.222
I used to. But since I was in France,
my eyesight has declined.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.982
- But it will mend?
- So Dr Enys assures me.

16:49.240 --> 16:53.427
- But where is Captain Poldark?
- Oh, he's hiding so he may avoid dancing.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.707
- With you as a partner? Is he mad?
- I've often thought so.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.180
Do I hear that you have been gifting land
to out-of-work miners?

17:06.360 --> 17:10.706
I recommend it, sir. Much good can be done
with even the smallest effort.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.020
My own exertions have been directed
towards a higher goal.

17:14.200 --> 17:19.263
- Overturning our old, corrupt political system.
- To what end?

17:19.440 --> 17:23.501
So that justice and equity
may ﬁlter down to those in most need.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.907
I applaud your intentions, sir.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.067
Without holding out much hope of their success.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.540
He's not sure which one.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.582
Morwenna.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.068
How are you?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.786
When do you expect?

17:55.720 --> 17:57.108
I do not know.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.181
Mama never spoke of such things.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.901
I did not know what to expect,

18:03.080 --> 18:07.858
what the...obligations of marriage would be.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.905
Is he unkind to you?

18:11.920 --> 18:13.308
He is a monster.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.104
Aha! You've escaped.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.226
Excellent. Can we go home?

18:37.360 --> 18:40.784
- You noticed how Falmouth avoided me?
- Did he?

18:40.960 --> 18:42.985
Nothing I do seems to gratify him.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.903
I've tried invitations, compliments, small gifts.

18:47.080 --> 18:52.063
Yes. I do wonder if it's wise
to be seen trying so hard.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.379
How else will he even notice me?

18:55.720 --> 18:57.426
Am I so beneath him?

18:57.600 --> 19:01.821
Yet the Bassets pass muster, and their wealth
comes from mining and banking.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.629
And is longer standing,
so society has grown used to them.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.667
Well, that may now be the better route.

19:09.800 --> 19:10.983
Basset.

19:12.200 --> 19:16.341
The Truro seat is vacant. Lord Falmouth
has always dictated apporntments

19:16.520 --> 19:19.159
by exerting pressure on the burgesses
to vote his way.

19:19.320 --> 19:22.460
Sir Francis believes such corruption
must be stopped.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.859
He intends to spearhead a campaign of reform

19:26.040 --> 19:29.419
and put up his own candidate
to challenge Falmouth's.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.785
- And that candidate would be?
- We'll see.

19:33.800 --> 19:39.500
We really will be off to hell in a handcart
if George Warleggan goes to parliament.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.300
If a handcart is your preferred mode
of transport, it can swiftly be arranged.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.901
(He grunts)

20:12.280 --> 20:16.626
I was disappointed in Killewarren.
No chintz, no gilding.

20:16.800 --> 20:21.146
But the scale of the establishment
puts our humble household to shame.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.225
I think you should have a companion

20:27.400 --> 20:30.779
to share the chores
and assist you with the children.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.382
I shall write to your sister.

20:32.560 --> 20:36.064
Your mother will be glad
to have another daughter off her hands.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.107
_ And doubtless that sister
wrll come to love me as you do.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.547
Good night.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.339
I don't love you.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.785
(He murmurs)

20:56.800 --> 20:58.188
(He grunts)

21:02.920 --> 21:05.059
I love Drake Carne.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.902
(He snores)

21:09.280 --> 21:10.907
I love Drake Carne.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.981
I love Drake Carne.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.939
(Tearfully) I love Drake Came.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.861
I love Drake Carne.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.339
Shall we pretend this is our wedding night?

21:36.360 --> 21:37.702
No pretence needed.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.189
Every night is our wedding night to me.

21:53.760 --> 21:57.981
- Lieutenant Armitage was most attentive today.
- To whom?

21:58.160 --> 22:01.140
Your wife. Perhaps overly attentive.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.785
- Did you not notice?
- I confess I did not.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.989
- Perhaps I imagined it.
- Quite possibly.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.545
Not every man in Cornwall is besotted with you.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.503
(Hammer clanging)

22:30.840 --> 22:32.580
See, brother?

22:32.760 --> 22:34.580
'Ee need fret no longer,

22:35.640 --> 22:38.097
for I've goodly work to keep me fed an' clothed.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.737
It isn't the body I fret for, but the soul.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.866
For I think 'ee still pine
for the girl who be lost to 'ee.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.304
Yet the time may come
when 'ee seek elsewhere

22:46.480 --> 22:49.699
for a wife 0' the Methodist connection,
sweet an' pure...

22:49.880 --> 22:53.384
Wheelwright Came, a job for 'ee.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.222
Missin' a crook on the end. Can 'ee fettle it?

22:57.040 --> 22:59.417
It looks simple enough.
Will 'ee come back tomorrow?

22:59.600 --> 23:01.739
If I've naught better to do.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.899
Sister, how's your soul?

23:05.320 --> 23:07.106
Are 'ee a stranger to divine things?

23:08.200 --> 23:11.340
No, lug. I get my fill of 'em daily!

23:13.200 --> 23:15.543
Will 'ee not join our meetings, where...

23:15.720 --> 23:18.097
we read the gospel
an' open our hearts to each other?

23:18.280 --> 23:20.942
(Laughs) Cook's life!

23:21.120 --> 23:24.339
Tell yer fables to them who be simple as babies.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.186
(She laughs)

23:28.320 --> 23:30.424
Be that the kind of maid 'ee 'ad in mind?

23:34.680 --> 23:36.068
G'day sister.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.259
What brings 'ee 'ere?

23:40.440 --> 23:42.579
News of Morwenna.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.348
Good news?

23:46.680 --> 23:48.147
She's with child.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.346
I can only pray the child will be a comfort to her.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.382
In my heart I know I must now let her go.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.466
Yes, brother, you must.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.419
GEORGE: Search the attics, cellars,
all storerooms and cupboards.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.023
The item was packed away
when I first took up residence here.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.623
It belongs to old mistress Agatha.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.699
- Find it.
- Yes, sur.

24:32.400 --> 24:37.178
- I think he's already showing an improvement.
- No doubt your aunt will claim the credit.

24:40.600 --> 24:45.503
- But it matters not, as long as he is improved.
- (She chuckles)

24:45.680 --> 24:47.659
(Valentine gurgles)

24:49.520 --> 24:50.703
(Makes baby sounds)

24:50.880 --> 24:53.337
(Snorting and quacking)

24:53.520 --> 24:56.978
Did Dwight mention
he'd been called to Trenwith?

24:57.160 --> 24:59.867
No. Why would he?

25:01.160 --> 25:05.062
The child has rickets. Valentine.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.506
'Tis said he may end up lame.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.063
Surely that's no concern of ours?

25:16.840 --> 25:18.057
No, Ross.

25:20.360 --> 25:24.023
I'm away to see Pascoe.
I'll be back before supper.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.588
Yes, Ross.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.184
...English language...never anything like it.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.818
(Vendors advertise their wares)

26:06.560 --> 26:08.107
Ah.

26:11.800 --> 26:15.907
As requested,
I've had prepared the deed of gift for your land.

26:16.920 --> 26:20.060
You should be aware of some news
which has just reached me.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.937
The Warleggans and the Bassets
have formed an "accommodation".

26:24.120 --> 26:26.759
- A merger?
- Not exactly.

26:26.920 --> 26:30.424
But an arrangement with each other's banks
whereby they will work together.

26:30.600 --> 26:35.344
I suspect this scheme has less to do
with business ambition than political.

26:35.520 --> 26:39.342
- Mr Pasco_e.
- Sir Francrs!

26:39.520 --> 26:40.987
Captain Poldark,

26:41.160 --> 26:45.585
you vanished from the wedding before I had
chance to invite you and your wife to dinner.

26:45.760 --> 26:49.218
- We seldom stir abroad, sir.
- Then I hope you will make this the exception.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.583
Shall we say Saturday?

26:54.320 --> 26:59.064
Your wife will be gratiﬁed. I believe she enjoys
high society these days.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.800
She has no spurious fame to contend with.

27:01.960 --> 27:05.862
Whereas I am only too aware
it's the sole reason for my sudden popularity.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.463
Take her. What harm could it do?

27:36.880 --> 27:39.337
- I've missed you, sister.
- Rowella!

27:45.840 --> 27:47.023
You're not well.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.464
- (Ossie shouts nearby)
- Yes. Quite well.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.027
I've no complaint.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.782
OSSIE: I should think not.

27:54.960 --> 28:00.159
- Your sister is most blessed amongst women.
- Yes, Osbourne.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.822
In private, you may call me Mr Whitworth.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.465
In public, you will address me as Vicar.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.468
Yes, Vicar.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.059
(Birdsong)

28:26.840 --> 28:29.149
The blessed Virgin an' the Holy Child?

28:30.120 --> 28:33.704
Oh, brother, it do gladden the heart
to see 'ee turn to God again.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.502
Yes, brother.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.946
I believe this be the item in question.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.901
Yes. (Chuckles)

29:35.680 --> 29:37.944
You seem excited. Is there good news?

29:38.120 --> 29:39.701
There is.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.541
And soon, I hope, there will be better.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.460
Am I permitted to know?

29:43.640 --> 29:47.667
Let us say that if my visit to Tehidy goes well...

29:47.840 --> 29:51.185
Tehidy? Did Sir Francis invite?

29:51.360 --> 29:53.737
He did not, but I know him to be at home today

30:00.600 --> 30:01.988
(He chuckles)

30:04.400 --> 30:05.469
Madam.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.746
The key is to strike while the iron's hot.
The door is ajar.

30:08.920 --> 30:12.697
Sir Francis is open to persuasion.
All he requires is a little push.

30:12.880 --> 30:17.465
Take a week, Georgie.
I shan't be upset if you miss my party.

30:17.640 --> 30:22.100
Thanks for the reminder, ma'am.
We will discuss that very subject when I return.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.577
(Scoffs)

30:30.160 --> 30:32.947
I can think of 100 more useful things
I could be doing.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.384
For shame, Ross,
you're becoming a misanthrope.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.779
I sympathise.
I'm no lover of company these days.

30:39.960 --> 30:43.703
- With the exception of my wife's.
- Sometimes Ross do make no exception!

30:43.880 --> 30:47.543
- Well, ifI have my way...
DEMELZA: Which you frequently do.

30:47.720 --> 30:51.144
...this will be our last excursion
for the foreseeable future.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.865
Why, sister, would you agree to marry that man?

31:07.440 --> 31:09.180
To save the life of the man I loved.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.339
And still love?

31:13.960 --> 31:15.985
Till my dying breath.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.384
Tell me of him. Tell me everything.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.898
Now, we have an unexpected addition
to our party.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.345
He got wind of your invitation
and insisted on joining us.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.260
Who can guess at his motives?

31:29.440 --> 31:34.309
His uncle and I cannot abide each other.
Our ways of doing business are wholly at odds.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.620
But I have a certain fondness for the nephew.

31:37.800 --> 31:41.349
So I trust you'll forgive me
for inflicting him upon you.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.388
Armitage!

31:47.320 --> 31:50.346
- Are we never to be rid of you?
- You'll be sorry you ever saved me.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.306
I regret the venture daily.

31:52.480 --> 31:56.257
I'm sure Dwight does. Now he's my prisoner
instead of the Republic's.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.749
And from that there can be no release.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.863
If you knew the pains I took
to get myself invited today.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.259
- Why did you so?
- Can you not guess?

32:21.240 --> 32:23.219
(indistinct chatter)

32:35.080 --> 32:38.538
CAROLINE: Then you are very much
in the minority, my Lord.

32:38.720 --> 32:42.269
The young general who crushed
the counter-revolution in Paris,

32:42.440 --> 32:45.147
I believe we'll be hearing
a good deal of him in future.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.823
Bonaparte? He's now in charge of
the French Army in Italy.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.740
Cleared the streets of Paris with cannon.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.627
- Fired on his own countrymen.
- Such a man is to be reckoned with.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.462
And their Directory of Five
who deposed the other bloody tyrants?

32:55.640 --> 32:58.302
They're criminals, in every sense of the word.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.142
My Uncle Falmouth would be relieved
to hear you say so.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.697
He speculated that
in dining with so prominent a Whig,

33:03.880 --> 33:06.223
I'd hear talk of peace
and views favourable to the Revolution.

33:06.400 --> 33:10.939
Then your uncle should know better. The true
Whig is as patriotic as any Tory in the land.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.619
What form might Lord Falmouth's plans
for Truro take? Who will be the next MP?

33:16.800 --> 33:17.903
You, perhaps?

33:18.080 --> 33:21.140
I'm not sufficiently biddable.
Too much of a rebel.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.778
I would have thought that made you
the ideal candidate, if revolution is your aim.

33:24.960 --> 33:28.100
Which it is not. I know my limitations.

33:28.280 --> 33:33.741
At sea I'm a passable navigator, on land
an average poet and an indifferent artist.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.387
You've been sketching? May we see?

33:37.560 --> 33:40.700
By no means. I've failed miserably
to do justice to my subject.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.181
(indistinct chatter)

33:50.520 --> 33:52.181
Mr Warleggan is here to see you, sir.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.340
Advise him I am engaged
and may be some time.

33:56.680 --> 34:00.582
I have taken the liberty of providing
some small entertainments.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.337
Shall we adjourn?

34:09.040 --> 34:10.746
(Laughter)

34:10.920 --> 34:12.421
(He chuckles)

34:14.560 --> 34:16.539
I shall await his pleasure here.

34:29.840 --> 34:30.909
Good luck.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.382
(Skittles clattering)

34:41.200 --> 34:42.781
SIR FRANCIS: Your turn, I think.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.463
So navigation, I think you said, at sea?

34:45.640 --> 34:47.301
At sea. Yes.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.466
Which is where I presently find myself.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.785
Wholly disorientated.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.628
Lost.

35:00.960 --> 35:06.159
It must seem strange to return to the comfort
and safety of home after the horrors of prison.

35:06.320 --> 35:09.027
I know Dwight also struggled.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.304
My struggles are of a different kind.

35:11.480 --> 35:12.617
SIR FRANCIS: Bravo!

35:12.800 --> 35:15.382
So different that I dare not even name them.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.585
- (Cheering)
MAN: Very good, sir.

35:17.760 --> 35:21.025
- And you will not ask me to.
- 'Tis hardly my business.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.906
I wish that were true.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.179
Blooms from the Garden of Eden.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.546
But where lurks Eve?

35:38.680 --> 35:40.864
And where the snake?

35:49.680 --> 35:52.660
(Cheering and scattered applause)

35:59.480 --> 36:01.459
(Door opens)

36:02.800 --> 36:03.983
(Door closes)

36:09.160 --> 36:13.745
I've taken note of your suggestion.
Gifting land to the deserving poor.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.667
And the undeserving poor?

36:17.520 --> 36:20.023
Let us begin by helping those
who help themselves.

36:20.200 --> 36:21.701
When do we begin?

36:23.560 --> 36:27.144
- Do you believe in equality?
- I believe in opportunity.

36:27.320 --> 36:32.223
I believe that industry should be rewarded
and the misuse of power punished.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.220
We appear to be of one mind.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.189
WOMAN:
Since when do I take instruction from you?

36:40.360 --> 36:43.340
- Shall you return to the navy?
- Once my eyes have mended.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.580
The fault is entirely my own,
for scribbling away in semi-darkness.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.137
- Letters home?
- Sketches.

36:49.320 --> 36:50.742
Attempts at verse.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.785
It was all that kept me sane.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.020
- You were sketching today.
- May I show you?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.740
I'm no Leonardo...

37:11.320 --> 37:13.504
...but you are surely Mona Lisa.

37:17.640 --> 37:21.667
- I do not know these people.
- Forgive me. My attempt at a compliment.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.540
Perhaps I should stick to verse.

37:25.720 --> 37:28.280
Especially with such inspiration before me.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.980
No one's ever written me poetry before.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.219
- Not even your husband?
- (Scoffs)

37:35.040 --> 37:38.783
Ross has been called many things,
but "poetic" is not one of them.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.788
May I see you again?

37:44.520 --> 37:46.659
And Ross too, of course.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.465
I will ask him when would be convenient.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.389
Let us suppose that
the burgesses are sick of being forced

37:59.560 --> 38:02.506
to cast their votes at Falmouth's command.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.422
ROSS: Should we also suppose
they're sick of the favours they enjoy,

38:05.600 --> 38:08.467
the business that comes their way
in exchange for those votes?

38:08.640 --> 38:14.101
In the coming Truro by-election, many have
indicated their willingness to defy Falmouth.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.022
And instead of voting for his candidate,
vote for yours?

38:17.200 --> 38:20.749
We both agree change is long overdue.
With the right man in place...

38:20.920 --> 38:22.547
The "right man"?

38:23.120 --> 38:27.261
I believe you are the man
to lead this revolution.

38:27.440 --> 38:30.420
If elected,
you will serve our borough in parliament.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.023
And I'd be expected to vote as you directed?

38:34.320 --> 38:39.701
Since you and I think along similar lines,
it could surely be no hardship to vote likewise?

38:52.680 --> 38:55.626
Truly, I believe that
if you and I walked into a room,

38:55.800 --> 38:59.679
all the men would look at me, but within
five minutes they'd all be clustered around you.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.705
I'm not sure that's a compliment.

39:01.880 --> 39:04.906
It is. But not one I think Ross would appreciate.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.945
(Skittles clatter)

39:10.680 --> 39:12.625
If he even noticed.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.984
(Skittles clatter)

39:21.520 --> 39:23.067
(Horse whinnies)

39:33.240 --> 39:36.459
Back already, Georgie?

39:36.640 --> 39:39.382
I told you we could manage without ye.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.182
Remind me, what is your age, ma'am?

39:51.360 --> 39:57.219
You know fine well
I shall be 100 years old on Monday.

39:58.640 --> 40:02.519
When I was last at Sawle church, I had
occasion to glance at the parish register.

40:02.680 --> 40:05.740
I could find no record of your baptism
in 1695.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.589
Of course, I was not content to leave it there,

40:10.760 --> 40:14.059
for baptisms do not always
instantly follow births.

40:15.240 --> 40:18.425
So yesterday,
I had the servants comb the house

40:18.600 --> 40:23.060
- until they found the old Poldark family bible.
- (Thud)

40:23.240 --> 40:25.379
And? What of it?

40:27.120 --> 40:28.747
Let me read you an entry.

40:30.680 --> 40:33.786
The ink is faded
but I suppose it to be your father's handwriting.

40:33.960 --> 40:39.978
"Born to us this autumn morn,
our first child, a daughter,

40:40.160 --> 40:41.980
Agatha Mary.

40:42.720 --> 40:46.349
September 14th, 1697."

40:47.760 --> 40:50.069
So you see, old crone,

40:50.240 --> 40:53.869
on Monday you will be but 98.

40:54.040 --> 40:57.589
'Tis a lie. A scabby lie!

40:57.760 --> 40:58.829
(Chuckles)

40:59.000 --> 41:03.187
My dear? How went the visit to Tehidy?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.139
We will discuss it another time.

41:22.360 --> 41:23.861
Well?

41:27.600 --> 41:29.420
I regret I must decline.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.182
Your reason?

41:32.360 --> 41:34.703
I cannot be another man's puppet.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.147
Not even one I admire.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.423
Or whose views are so similar to my own.

41:41.720 --> 41:44.097
You cannot ignore the way the world works.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.783
If you dislike the system, change it from within.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.983
- There is sense in what you say.
- But?

41:50.160 --> 41:54.426
But the noble impulse
which impels a man to enter politics

41:54.600 --> 41:56.067
often falls by the wayside.

41:56.720 --> 42:01.419
Power is pursued for its own sake,
rather than the good it can do.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.104
_ Who am I __
to claim exemption from these failings?

42:05.280 --> 42:07.305
Will you not even try?

42:07.480 --> 42:11.780
I cannot believe I would emerge
from this process with my soul intact.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.621
(Scoffs) Your soul?

42:14.800 --> 42:16.062
Your stubbornness.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.026
It will be your undoing, Poldark.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.065
(Crunches)

42:29.240 --> 42:30.457
(Winces)

42:34.080 --> 42:36.867
This shoe does pinch my toes.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.139
(Door opens and closes)

42:52.320 --> 42:54.697
See how easy it is to be rid of him?

42:54.880 --> 42:58.065
Sshh! Do not jest about it.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.859
He is my husband,

43:02.040 --> 43:03.905
till death do us part.

43:05.400 --> 43:06.901
Amen, sister.

43:13.320 --> 43:16.027
I think it was a mistake to refuse Sir Francis.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.389
I never knew you had ambitions
to be a political wife.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.663
Nor do I!

43:21.840 --> 43:24.820
But you, your influence is great.
There's much good you could do.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.982
- And is not Sir Francis a goodly man?
- Yes!

43:29.160 --> 43:31.720
But he too uses his power for his own ends.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.218
And he would use me, if I would let him.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.189
(Signs)

43:37.360 --> 43:39.021
(Birds squawk)

43:40.040 --> 43:41.428
But I will not.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.503
(Tinkles)

43:49.400 --> 43:51.379
(Panﬁng)

43:53.840 --> 43:55.387
(Knocking on door)

43:55.560 --> 44:00.384
Come in, Lucy Pipe, idle girl!
Where's my supper?

44:00.560 --> 44:02.539
(Door opens creakily)

44:08.760 --> 44:11.547
There will be no supper, old woman.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.859
(Door creaks shut)

44:15.160 --> 44:17.025
There will be no party.

44:17.200 --> 44:20.943
I'll have letters sent to all your guests,
informing them that you made a mistake,

44:21.120 --> 44:23.224
that you are 97, not 99,

44:23.400 --> 44:26.142
and a new invitation will be issued
in two years' time.

44:27.400 --> 44:29.709
If you're still above ground then.

44:32.240 --> 44:33.343
But...

44:34.600 --> 44:36.181
...'tis all prepared.

44:36.360 --> 44:40.239
Food ordered, my old topaz ring altered to fit.

44:40.400 --> 44:41.901
Pit)'-

44:43.040 --> 44:47.500
My birthday's on Monday, 98's a good age.

44:47.680 --> 44:50.820
I've been looking forward to this party
for so long.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.979
No one need know I'm not 100.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.787
(Chuckles)

45:01.320 --> 45:05.063
I'll not live two year more, you know that.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.701
Who'd guess if ye said naught?

45:17.360 --> 45:19.624
I'll not cross ye again, George.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.939
Let me have my party.

45:36.320 --> 45:40.427
There...will...be...no...party.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.137
Wait!

45:51.160 --> 45:56.143
You do this to me, may you rot in hell!

45:57.080 --> 46:00.379
You and your nasty uncle
and your little twisted son!

46:00.560 --> 46:03.461
Born under a black moon and warped already?

46:04.480 --> 46:07.779
Little Valentine, the so-called Warleggan heir.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.781
Or is he?

46:14.000 --> 46:17.140
That was no eight-month baby, George.

46:18.080 --> 46:21.345
Early babes be weak and wrinkled,
no hair, no nails.

46:22.160 --> 46:26.347
But that babe was lusty and smooth

46:26.520 --> 46:31.457
and strong as a full-term child!

46:32.520 --> 46:36.342
(Gasps)
So maybe you didn't wait for the wedding.

46:38.640 --> 46:42.940
Or maybe somebody got there before ye!

46:46.440 --> 46:48.419
(Breathes heavily)

46:56.560 --> 46:58.744
(Panﬁng)

47:31.160 --> 47:32.377
George?

47:33.920 --> 47:35.239
Are you unwell?

47:38.040 --> 47:40.417
That old woman...

47:44.960 --> 47:46.939
...will have no party.

47:48.080 --> 47:51.709
What do you mean?
Has she given orders to defer it?

48:00.480 --> 48:02.823
Sir Francis Basset's here, sir.

48:05.680 --> 48:07.386
What the devil can he want?

48:14.520 --> 48:16.897
(inhales deeply)

48:31.320 --> 48:32.867
(Door closes)

48:40.040 --> 48:41.428
(Door opens)

48:44.560 --> 48:46.744
You called to see me today.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.302
I did, sir.

48:50.400 --> 48:53.142
But you were otherwise engaged.

48:53.320 --> 48:55.629
And now I fear the moment has passed.

48:57.960 --> 48:59.541
Not necessarily.

48:59.720 --> 49:01.824
Was there something you wanted to discuss?

49:06.880 --> 49:07.983
Change.

49:08.160 --> 49:09.741
Yes?

49:09.920 --> 49:14.505
That is what you seek,
but it's not easy to achieve.

49:14.680 --> 49:18.343
- Nor its advocates popular.
- Go on.

49:18.520 --> 49:23.264
The right man would not need to be popular.
He would only need to be capable.

49:24.280 --> 49:26.305
Of achieving the task in hand,

49:26.480 --> 49:28.539
by whatever means necessary.

49:29.480 --> 49:30.868
(Murmurs) My party.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.587
My birth... My birthday.

49:32.760 --> 49:35.547
(Mutters incoherently)

49:35.720 --> 49:38.280
- Aunt, what has happened?
- My party.

49:38.440 --> 49:40.863
My party My party-

49:41.040 --> 49:43.702
George won't allow my party.

49:43.880 --> 49:45.381
Be calm, dearest aunt.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.619
Tormented me, he did.

49:47.800 --> 49:51.065
Took my hope, took my home.

49:51.240 --> 49:53.185
Do not exert yourself.

49:55.600 --> 50:00.822
Yet I... I should not have said what I did.

50:04.120 --> 50:08.147
Elizabeth...will never forgive me.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.587
Forgive you?

50:13.800 --> 50:16.382
I should not have told him.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.548
Told him what?

50:22.480 --> 50:23.981
Aunt?

50:25.080 --> 50:27.025
Told him what?

50:30.120 --> 50:31.337
Aunt?

50:32.720 --> 50:34.187
Told him what? (Gasps)

50:34.360 --> 50:36.305
(Valentine cries nearby)

50:42.360 --> 50:44.180
- (Exhales)
- (Valentine cries)

50:55.800 --> 50:58.860
Well, ma'am, I hope we can count on
your support in our newest venture.

50:59.040 --> 51:03.625
A candidate to challenge Lord Falmouth
in the coming by-election has been found.

51:04.640 --> 51:05.823
Is this true?

51:07.200 --> 51:11.421
It is a fine thing for young Valentine
to have an MP as a father.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.340
Indeed.

51:16.160 --> 51:17.661
Forgive me.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.627
My great aunt is dead.

51:23.200 --> 51:26.863
My sincere condolences.
I will detain you no longer.

51:31.040 --> 51:36.785
I trust, when you have grieved for the departed,
that there will be time for celebration.

51:40.720 --> 51:43.223
(Door opens and closes)

51:49.520 --> 51:51.147
(Waves crash)

52:07.000 --> 52:09.139
SAM: Nice to see you, sister. Welcome.

52:16.280 --> 52:20.819
'Ee be like unto the Lost Sheep, brother,
thy thoughts all pure again.

52:22.880 --> 52:25.019
My thoughts are not pure, brother.

52:30.080 --> 52:33.060
Mine neither. God forgive me.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.260
(Sighs deeply)

52:41.880 --> 52:43.620
Every button cost a crown

52:43.800 --> 52:45.347
Harvey Darvey, turn around

52:45.520 --> 52:47.499
Heel to heel and toe to toe

52:47.680 --> 52:49.545
Turn around and off we go

52:51.120 --> 52:53.020
Sir Francis is right. You are stubborn.

52:53.200 --> 52:55.760
- Pragmatic.
- Pig-headed.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.980
Would you prefer naive? Or sentimental?

52:59.160 --> 53:00.627
Sometimes, Ross, yes, I would!

53:01.640 --> 53:03.346
This jus' come from Trenwith.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.381
DEMELZA: What is it?

53:14.120 --> 53:15.701
Aunt Agatha's dead.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.027
Ross!

53:20.240 --> 53:21.662
I should have been there.

53:21.840 --> 53:27.779
Poor ole cooter. To think of 'er on 'er death-bed
wi' no Poldark kin to ease 'er departin'.

53:30.800 --> 53:33.303
- (Baby gurgles)
- Ssh. Ssh, ssh, ssh. Prudie.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.379
PRUDIE:
She be last of the Trenwith Poldarks.

53:36.560 --> 53:38.300
There's still Geoffrey Charles.

53:38.480 --> 53:42.223
Doubtless George'll find a way
to part him from his inheritance.

53:44.440 --> 53:46.260
Judas!

53:55.520 --> 53:59.297
There was more to George's note
than the news of her death.

54:02.720 --> 54:04.108
Funeral arrangements?

54:05.320 --> 54:07.902
- Not a word.
- What, then?

54:11.680 --> 54:13.739
"I hope you and Demelza will rejoice in the news

54:13.920 --> 54:17.026
that I have been selected by Sir Francis Basset

54:17.200 --> 54:21.148
to be the candidate to oppose Lord Falmouth's
in the Truro by-election."

54:22.480 --> 54:26.359
- Well, there it is.
- Yes, and you could've prevented it.

54:26.520 --> 54:29.341
- No, I couldn't.
- Will you never learn?

54:29.520 --> 54:31.465
How long do you think
you can do as you please,

54:31.640 --> 54:34.097
plough your own furrow,
regardless of anyone else or I?

54:34.280 --> 54:36.737
- Demelza... _
- Not once have you asked my adVIce

54:36.920 --> 54:38.899
or harkened to my opinion - not once.

54:39.080 --> 54:40.945
What do you want, Demelza?

54:42.400 --> 54:45.745
A man who will lie down, roll over,

54:45.920 --> 54:47.581
sit up and beg for you?

54:49.160 --> 54:51.344
Well, if so, you've married the wrong man.

54:53.160 --> 54:54.787
'Twould appear so.

54:56.720 --> 54:59.097
Perhaps you should look elsewhere for a pet.

55:00.560 --> 55:02.061
Perhaps I should.

55:06.160 --> 55:08.503
Perhaps I won't have to look too far.

55:47.520 --> 55:48.589
(Thud)

55:58.560 --> 55:59.697
(Grunts)

56:02.000 --> 56:03.217
Is that it?

56:05.280 --> 56:08.465
No family? No ceremony?

56:08.640 --> 56:10.540
'Twas ordered a quick and secret buryin'.

56:10.720 --> 56:13.097
'Tis all I could do to get word to thee.

56:16.600 --> 56:18.261
She was a Poldark.

56:20.080 --> 56:22.139
And my most beloved aunt.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.501
George will pay for this.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.819
Nay, 'tis my task.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.549
She was a great lady...and a rare spirit.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.659
It's the least I can do to honour her.
