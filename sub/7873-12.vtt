11:52.545 --> 11:57.539
Wow! That looks like a game
we play back in America called golf.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.886
Tell us about America, Stan.

12:00.986 --> 12:03.750
Haveyou ever floated to heaven
on angel wings?

12:03.856 --> 12:06.256
Tasted a cinnamon bun
fresh from the oven?

12:06.358 --> 12:09.987
Licked hot chocolate from Santa's beard?
That's what America's like.

12:10.096 --> 12:12.189
Not like here,
with the sand and the heat.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.823
Good Lord! How do you stand
the sand and the heat?

12:14.934 --> 12:18.631
That is whywe wear robes.
It keeps us cool in hot temperatures.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.730
Really? I thought it was because
your God doesn't believe in pants!

12:22.875 --> 12:26.174
- [ All Laugh ]
- Stan, what a funny guy!

12:26.278 --> 12:28.678
Thanks. You know,
I once stood in for Leno.

12:28.781 --> 12:32.148
I don't understand. Ifyou love America
so much, why areyou here?

12:32.251 --> 12:35.880
It's a long story. I asked mywife
to help me plan this party for my boss...

12:35.988 --> 12:37.888
- and she said no, so-
- What doyou mean?

12:37.990 --> 12:41.016
You asked her, and she said no?
You mean, you told her, and she obeyed.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.925
Uh, no. See,
she had this play, and, uh-

12:44.029 --> 12:47.465
Stan, the rules are different
here for more than just golf.

12:47.566 --> 12:49.466
Allow me to explain.

12:51.737 --> 12:54.706
# Here in Saudi Arabia #

12:54.807 --> 12:57.139
- [ Gunshot]
- No singing!

12:57.243 --> 12:59.609
Cheese and rice!
Who are those guys?

12:59.712 --> 13:01.703
They are the police
ofvice and virtue.

13:01.814 --> 13:05.215
They make sure everyone follows
our country's strict moral code.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.979
Public singing is illegal
in Saudi Arabia.

13:08.087 --> 13:12.490
This was his third offense.
Too bad. He had a lovelyvoice.

13:12.591 --> 13:16.254
Wow! It's like the Footloose town
times a million!

13:16.362 --> 13:20.958
You think that's something?
Wait till you hear the rules about women.

13:24.703 --> 13:28.696
Does this furniture polish
have alcohol in it? [ Gulps ]

13:28.808 --> 13:31.072
Mmm. Tastes like I might die.

13:31.177 --> 13:34.840
- Hello, assorted family members.
- Wow! Someone's in a better mood.

13:34.947 --> 13:39.281
I sure am! I was thinking about howyou said
we should immerse ourselves in the culture.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.285
- I couldn't agree more.
- Great.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.412
Let's talk in the car.
I wanna see the palace before sunset.

13:43.522 --> 13:45.422
Baby, slowyour roll.

13:45.524 --> 13:49.654
I learned something interesting today.
Did you know- Hayley, you'll appreciate this too.

13:49.762 --> 13:53.391
Doyou know women can't leave the home
unless accompanied by a man?

13:53.499 --> 13:56.263
What areyou talking about?
We all left the house earlier.

13:56.368 --> 13:59.895
Right. And Steve was with you.
In this culture, he's considered a man.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.371
- I am?
- You sure are!

14:02.474 --> 14:05.773
Also, there's no cursing, dancing,
singing, no bars, no movie theaters.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.346
Oh, and women can't drive
or ride bicycles.

14:08.447 --> 14:12.941
And here's the best rule.
The man has final say on everything.

14:13.052 --> 14:16.112
So, no, Francine.
We're not going to see the palace.

14:16.222 --> 14:19.055
We're going to do whatever I want,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

14:19.158 --> 14:23.390
This is ridiculous! Ifyou don't
want to go out, I'll go by myself.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.395
Francine, I forbid it!

14:25.497 --> 14:28.022
Yeah? Well, too bad.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.431
Thanks.Just, uh-
Just put her anywhere.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.974
- Morning, honey.
- Stan, I've had it. I wanna go home!

14:43.082 --> 14:46.347
- Has Bullock called backyet?
- Oh, notyet. I'll keep trying.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.682
Oh, I invited the fellas
over for a feast afterwork...

14:48.787 --> 14:50.846
so I figured you could
whip something up.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.947
Or as they say in this country-

14:53.058 --> 14:58.052
Forget it! You may keep me locked up in
this house, but I control what I do in it.

14:58.163 --> 15:01.860
Or as they say in my country-
[ Snaps Twice ]

15:01.967 --> 15:03.867
Fine, I'll cook it myself!.

15:05.304 --> 15:08.068
Now, how do I do this
without getting hair everywhere?

15:08.173 --> 15:11.734
Steve, come on! I'm supposed to meet
the neighbor's son in 20 minutes.

15:11.844 --> 15:15.302
You know the rule. Say it,
and I'll escortyou to the bazaar.

15:15.414 --> 15:19.180
[ Sighs ] You're the manliest man
in the history of manly men.

15:19.285 --> 15:22.516
- And?
- And when you're in your late 30s,
you may have a chance...

15:22.621 --> 15:26.352
at convincing a long-time female friend
to have awkward pity sex with you once.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.358
Oh, yeah.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.655
[ Chattering]

15:30.763 --> 15:33.857
Thanks for bringing me with. There's
booze here somewhere. I just know it.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.866
- Oh, dead cow.
- Oh, there he is!

15:37.569 --> 15:41.369
Hayley, you are even more beautiful
than I imagined.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.537
- [ Gasps ] Who areyou?
- I am Mrs. Smith.

15:47.646 --> 15:50.672
Uh, no. I'm Mrs. Smith.

Ladies, ladies,
you're both Mrs. Smith.

15:53.352 --> 15:57.186
- Stan, what on earth?
- Surprise! I got us a second wife!

15:57.289 --> 15:59.280
You know, to help
with cooking and cleaning.

15:59.391 --> 16:02.360
Her name's impossible to pronounce,
so I just call herThundercat.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.396
What? You got a second wife?

16:05.497 --> 16:08.728

I will serve him in this life and next.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.803
Look, Francine,
it's just the way things are done here.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.429
Think ofher as a full-time housekeeper
we don't have to pay...

16:14.540 --> 16:17.338
or give our out-of-style clothing to.

the greatest culture in the world!
