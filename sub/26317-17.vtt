00:00.038 --> 00:01.257
<i>Previously on "S.W.A.T."...</i>

00:01.282 --> 00:03.601
I'm a cop. Now, you can watch me die,

00:03.648 --> 00:05.382
or you can help me get us out of here.

00:05.438 --> 00:06.951
- Okay.
<i>- He's just a scared kid.</i>

00:07.006 --> 00:08.468
<i>He had nothing to do with any of this.</i>

00:10.675 --> 00:12.242
I owe you one, buddy.

00:12.267 --> 00:14.268
I saw another approval form for
a moonlighting gig on my desk.

00:14.303 --> 00:15.603
Yeah, I'm just trying to bank

00:15.637 --> 00:17.105
some extra cash before the baby comes.

00:17.139 --> 00:19.014
There's "I'm about
to have a kid" moonlighting,

00:19.039 --> 00:22.124
and then there's "I'm about
to lose the house" moonlighting.

00:22.149 --> 00:23.378
Which is it?

00:23.412 --> 00:25.446
I need a loan, right now, off the books.

00:25.481 --> 00:27.715
- I just told you I'm above board now.
- $11,000

00:27.750 --> 00:29.717
is all I need. I'll be back
on my feet in a month,

00:29.752 --> 00:32.086
and you'll have it all back
with interest.

00:34.189 --> 00:35.156
<i>You okay?</i>

00:35.190 --> 00:36.391
- You okay?
- I can't move.

00:36.425 --> 00:38.559
I talked to my son.
He ain't going to college.

00:38.594 --> 00:39.927
<i>Hell, he ain't gonna finish high school.</i>

00:39.962 --> 00:41.596
I'm gonna keep checking in on you,

00:41.630 --> 00:43.765
but this ain't got to be your life.

00:43.799 --> 00:44.766
Don't it?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:04.119 --> 01:05.420
Help!

01:05.453 --> 01:07.121
Hold still!

01:07.156 --> 01:10.141
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:16.899 --> 01:19.100
Some of these wounds went pretty deep.

01:19.134 --> 01:24.205
Came close to lacerating
a kidney, but Darryl got lucky.

01:24.247 --> 01:26.348
<i>Officer Greer to infirmary.</i>

01:26.375 --> 01:28.142
<i>Officer Greer to the infirmary.</i>

01:28.179 --> 01:30.010
Doc.

01:31.456 --> 01:33.361
I've been keeping tabs on him,

01:33.386 --> 01:36.222
- and I know he got attacked once before.
- Not as bad as this.

01:36.247 --> 01:38.186
I don't like the
direction things are headed.

01:38.220 --> 01:40.083
Thank you.

01:48.063 --> 01:50.031
What happened?

01:50.065 --> 01:53.234
Not as tough
as you thought you were, huh?

01:53.268 --> 01:56.204
Or are the cats here in juvie
just a little tougher?

02:04.680 --> 02:07.215
How does it feel
to almost die today, big man?

02:09.716 --> 02:11.686
You tell your pops about this?

02:13.088 --> 02:15.756
He called me last week from lockup.

02:15.791 --> 02:19.327
He said I need to man up,
assert my dominance.

02:21.630 --> 02:24.832
That's one choice, Darryl.

02:24.867 --> 02:27.235
What do you want?

02:27.269 --> 02:30.238
I-I knew it wasn't gonna
be easy in here,

02:31.303 --> 02:33.437
but I didn't know
it's gonna be like this.

02:35.244 --> 02:37.211
Boy, look at me.

02:37.246 --> 02:39.544
Look at me.

02:41.550 --> 02:44.123
If you are really ready
to make a change,

02:44.505 --> 02:47.522
if you are truly ready
to put in some work,

02:47.556 --> 02:49.123
I might be able to help you.

02:49.157 --> 02:50.925
How?

02:52.060 --> 02:54.228
You getting attacked like this,

02:54.263 --> 02:57.598
I might be able to help you get
approved for an early release,

02:57.633 --> 02:59.539
but I'd have to pull custodial papers

02:59.564 --> 03:00.963
and get ahold of your mom.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.304
Sh-She won't go for it.

03:03.338 --> 03:04.639
You don't know that.

03:04.673 --> 03:07.141
- You don't know my mom.
- I'll get to know her, Darryl.

03:07.175 --> 03:11.078
But before I do anything,
you got a choice to make.

03:11.113 --> 03:15.650
If I get you out, you got
to commit to living right.

03:15.684 --> 03:17.718
That means no more gangs, Darryl.

03:17.753 --> 03:20.305
No more drinking, no more drugs,

03:20.368 --> 03:22.268
and you ain't gonna surround
yourself with nobody trying

03:22.321 --> 03:24.025
to break the law. Do you understand me?

03:27.462 --> 03:29.830
What's it gonna be, man?

03:29.865 --> 03:32.833
Are you ready to turn your back
on all this noise

03:32.868 --> 03:35.202
and go down a different road
than your daddy?

03:44.442 --> 03:46.311
Yeah, I know,
that's the one that I beat.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.613
- No, you didn't.
- Hey, you're here early.

03:48.638 --> 03:51.174
I didn't think desk jockeys
started for a few hours.

03:51.199 --> 03:52.978
Hey, get this: you know how

03:53.021 --> 03:54.917
the doctor said it would
take ten weeks for my back

03:54.942 --> 03:56.624
to heal enough to get to 90% mobility?

03:56.658 --> 03:58.292
Yeah. You swore you'd hit it
in six, right?

03:58.327 --> 04:00.950
Did it in three. Therapist
ran a battery of tests,

04:00.975 --> 04:02.597
I scored at or above
all the requirements.

04:02.631 --> 04:05.060
- Wow. Congrats, man.
- Nice, bro.

04:05.085 --> 04:07.255
You know, the way
you saved those people,

04:07.280 --> 04:09.136
rumor is you're being
considered for the Police Star.

04:09.171 --> 04:11.361
Yeah, well, rumors are just that.

04:11.386 --> 04:13.486
Hey, why not just play it safe, man?

04:13.511 --> 04:14.893
Spend time with Annie and the kids.

04:14.933 --> 04:17.196
You know, enjoy being a nine-to-fiver
while you can.

04:17.221 --> 04:19.120
At least for another month.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.649
Oh.

04:21.683 --> 04:23.551
You can't collect OT

04:23.585 --> 04:25.519
until they put you
back out in the field.

04:25.554 --> 04:28.189
That's why you're trying to push
yourself, to pay me back?

04:28.223 --> 04:32.637
No, no. I'm-I'm doing what I can
to help my team, help the city.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.464
- Trust me, I'm fine.
- Okay.

04:36.498 --> 04:38.165
All right? I'm gonna go
spread the good news.

04:39.138 --> 04:40.635
<i>I'm ready to get back out there.</i>

04:40.669 --> 04:41.836
Today.

04:41.870 --> 04:43.702
Full recovery takes ten weeks.

04:43.733 --> 04:45.231
Well, the therapist sees no issue

04:45.256 --> 04:46.911
with me returning to the field,

04:46.936 --> 04:49.161
and department standards
say that eligibility

04:49.186 --> 04:51.177
requires 90% mobility. I'm there.

04:51.202 --> 04:54.844
90 isn't 100, and SWAT isn't
just a job in any department.

04:54.869 --> 04:57.318
She can offer her recommendation,
but this is my call.

04:57.352 --> 04:58.986
If it takes ten weeks
to recover, then that's

04:59.021 --> 05:01.109
what's required and that's
what I want for you.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.423
Please.

05:02.457 --> 05:03.819
How can I prove I'm ready?

05:03.844 --> 05:06.160
You can take seven more weeks
of desk duty.

05:06.194 --> 05:08.996
I'm sorry, Deac, but that's
the only way we can be sure.

05:17.739 --> 05:20.937
Honey, he says he can't wait to see you.

05:21.043 --> 05:22.877
Your father's new car was
dropped off this morning.

05:22.911 --> 05:24.712
I am sure the other girls

05:24.746 --> 05:26.747
are gonna spend spring break
with their parents.

05:26.782 --> 05:29.917
Uh... Gary, who's behind us?

05:29.951 --> 05:31.719
Probably just got the wrong house.

05:35.382 --> 05:38.451
Sir? This is private property.

05:38.493 --> 05:39.794
- You need to go back...
- Down on the ground.

05:39.828 --> 05:41.262
- Down on the ground right now.
- Okay, okay, I'm doing it.

05:41.296 --> 05:43.264
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Okay. Sharon!

05:43.298 --> 05:45.132
Men with guns are here. Call for help.

05:45.167 --> 05:48.135
- Get off the phone. Get out of the car.
- Okay. Okay.

05:48.170 --> 05:49.770
I'm getting out... I'm getting
out, I'm getting out.

05:49.813 --> 05:51.413
- I'm getting out.
- Yeah, get out, over here, over here.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.972
Get on the ground. Get down,
Mom, right on the ground,

05:53.018 --> 05:54.316
- next to him. Come on.
- Okay.

05:57.894 --> 06:00.047
Wallet's in my back pocket.
Please don't hurt us.

06:00.082 --> 06:01.916
Shut up. I'm telling you,
shut up. Finished?

06:01.950 --> 06:04.019
Almost.

06:04.044 --> 06:05.939
<i>Location services disabled.</i>

06:05.964 --> 06:07.088
All right, we're good. Let's go!

06:07.122 --> 06:09.223
Let's move.

06:09.257 --> 06:11.158
Get up!

06:11.193 --> 06:12.727
No! Sharon!

06:12.761 --> 06:14.562
- Stay down.
- Drop the weapon!

07:11.038 --> 07:12.803
Luca said you wanted to see me?

07:12.858 --> 07:14.792
Carjacking spree going down as we speak.

07:14.826 --> 07:16.427
Four separate incidents.

07:16.461 --> 07:18.863
Six injured, security guard in a coma.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.910
Two-man team behind it,
armed and at large.

07:20.935 --> 07:23.473
Latest target, Aston Martin,
Hidden Hills.

07:23.512 --> 07:25.269
Owner just took delivery this morning.

07:25.303 --> 07:26.537
You worked that undercover

07:26.571 --> 07:27.938
street racing gig, got to know

07:27.973 --> 07:29.595
all the big boys in black market auto.

07:29.620 --> 07:30.736
You ever run across a player

07:30.761 --> 07:32.129
- this aggressive?
- No. I've never heard

07:32.154 --> 07:34.311
of four violent carjackings
in this short a time.

07:34.346 --> 07:37.481
Another car was reported stolen
at gunpoint from a garage.

07:37.508 --> 07:39.111
Everyone knows Kathleen Schumacher

07:39.144 --> 07:40.519
from Auto Theft Task Force?

07:40.543 --> 07:42.557
Detective. Your team
suspects this is the work

07:42.582 --> 07:43.712
of the same two-man crew?

07:43.746 --> 07:46.111
Too early to tell. We usually
investigate bump-and-robs,

07:46.136 --> 07:48.383
- bust chop shops, but this is different.
- How's that?

07:48.425 --> 07:51.682
A McLaren 650 carjacked
from a Calabasas intersection,

07:51.707 --> 07:53.088
driver shot.

07:53.122 --> 07:56.758
Maserati stolen from a Westwood
gym, driver hospitalized.

07:56.793 --> 07:59.273
An Audi R8 lifted from Beverly Hills,

07:59.298 --> 08:02.289
a Porsche wrestled
from a Santa Monica valet,

08:02.314 --> 08:03.865
the Aston Martin in Hidden Hills.

08:03.908 --> 08:05.687
This is all in the past four hours.

08:05.722 --> 08:08.370
We can't say these guys aren't picky.
Those are all sick rides.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.938
Yeah, and brand spankin' new.

08:09.973 --> 08:11.139
My team is scrambling.

08:11.174 --> 08:13.442
Carjackings are normally
crimes of opportunity.

08:13.476 --> 08:15.699
No way this isn't coordinated,
but what's their plan?

08:15.724 --> 08:17.059
Hijack a fleet of luxury vehicles

08:17.084 --> 08:18.413
and sell 'em for parts?

08:18.448 --> 08:19.815
That's the operating theory.

08:19.849 --> 08:21.650
- It's a lot of risk for limited reward.
- Street,

08:21.684 --> 08:23.448
you got any idea who could be
trading black market parts

08:23.473 --> 08:25.893
- for cars like this?
- No clue, but they'd have to be a crew

08:25.918 --> 08:28.166
that knows their way around
some top-of-the-line technology.

08:28.191 --> 08:30.237
Hey. Elderly woman was
just pistol-whipped

08:30.262 --> 08:33.058
out of her brand-new
Mercedes S-Class in Bel Air.

08:33.082 --> 08:35.027
Two attackers, same M.O. as the rest.

08:35.052 --> 08:37.432
I got the car's GPS signature
from the manufacturer

08:37.467 --> 08:39.467
before the carjackers took it off-line.

08:39.501 --> 08:41.770
So the satellite tracks the cars
for about a half a mile,

08:41.804 --> 08:44.651
and then the GPS goes dark,
just like the others.

08:44.676 --> 08:46.341
There's no way to track them.
They could be anywhere by now.

08:46.376 --> 08:48.577
No, hold up, hold up.
You see the trajectory

08:48.611 --> 08:49.945
of these three cars
before the signal drops?

08:49.979 --> 08:52.390
- They're all headed due east.
- Yeah, but these three

08:52.415 --> 08:53.840
are moving the opposite direction,

08:53.883 --> 08:55.484
right to the 10 freeway.

08:55.518 --> 08:57.686
These vehicles are headed for East L.A.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.121
That's a huge area to cover.

08:59.155 --> 09:00.355
That's a good place to start.

09:00.390 --> 09:02.213
Detective, can your team work backward,

09:02.238 --> 09:04.358
- track each car's point of origin?
- Of course.

09:04.436 --> 09:05.722
All right, what's the word
on Highway Patrol?

09:05.795 --> 09:07.763
BOLOs on every vehicle.
We got three birds in the sky.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.712
All right, we got to get out there.
Now, they work quick,

09:09.737 --> 09:11.433
so it's not gonna be easy
to get ahead of 'em.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.102
We stay near freeway entrances,
every major intersection,

09:14.137 --> 09:15.670
- be ready to pounce. Let's move.
- Yeah.

09:15.705 --> 09:17.672
Street, there is no way

09:17.726 --> 09:20.308
this outfit isn't tapped
into the auto world somehow.

09:20.343 --> 09:21.710
Is there anyone you can talk to?

09:21.744 --> 09:24.946
Anyone that might know something?

09:24.981 --> 09:27.349
- What's up, Whip?
- What's up, Street?

09:27.383 --> 09:28.884
- How you doing?
- Good.

09:28.918 --> 09:30.619
Wow, love this bike.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.055
Oh, yeah. She's gonna be
a beaut when she's finished.

09:33.089 --> 09:36.238
Hey, thanks for hooking me up
with the Parking Division.

09:36.263 --> 09:37.559
- I really appreciate that.
- Yeah, man.

09:37.593 --> 09:39.828
- How'd the interview go?
- Oh, you know, haven't heard back yet.

09:39.862 --> 09:41.434
Well, maybe you should
try taking the year

09:41.468 --> 09:43.007
you spent in prison off your résumé.

09:43.032 --> 09:45.958
Oh! Yeah, I hadn't
really thought about that.

09:45.983 --> 09:48.503
It's kind of been my icebreaker,
so I might keep it.

09:48.538 --> 09:51.724
I got pretty pent up after
three months on house arrest.

09:51.749 --> 09:55.089
Other than you and my brother,
no one really stopped by to see me.

09:55.114 --> 09:58.814
But I got the monitor off my
ankle, so things are looking up.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.557
You know, a better hacker

10:00.582 --> 10:02.317
would have had that thing
disabled in no time.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.167
Oh, come on, man. You know I could hack

10:04.192 --> 10:06.655
that thing in my sleep, but, you know...

10:06.689 --> 10:08.457
- So, are you on duty or what?
- Yeah, come here.

10:10.007 --> 10:11.726
- Seen the news yet?
- Oh...

10:11.761 --> 10:13.057
- These are the cars getting lifted?
- Yeah.

10:13.082 --> 10:15.263
Oh, man.

10:15.307 --> 10:17.575
The McLaren and the Maserati alone

10:17.600 --> 10:21.064
will net you a few hundred Gs,
but six cars like that?

10:21.089 --> 10:22.892
That haul is gonna be over two mil.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.773
- Any thoughts on who's responsible?
- Nope.

10:24.807 --> 10:27.008
I'm about as far out of the loop
as you can get now.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.945
Huh. Let me see that.

10:29.979 --> 10:31.513
They know which cars they want.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.115
- They're targeting specific models?
- Uh-uh.

10:33.149 --> 10:35.383
Specific vehicles. See, cars like these

10:35.418 --> 10:37.048
are installed with the most secure

10:37.073 --> 10:38.620
GPS systems on the market.

10:38.654 --> 10:40.889
It's, like, totally unique
anti-theft codes to override.

10:40.923 --> 10:42.891
So, to get them off-line that fast,

10:42.925 --> 10:45.483
you'd need someone
inside the car jamming the GPS

10:45.508 --> 10:48.563
at the same time as the car's
signal drops from the satellite.

10:48.598 --> 10:50.565
- They have someone hacking satellites?
- Mm-hmm.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.711
I mean, who's capable
of even pulling that off?

10:52.736 --> 10:54.603
You mean besides me? Um...

10:54.637 --> 10:57.272
Eric Ross in Torrance. Uh...

10:57.306 --> 10:59.307
A guy named Diesel at that, uh,

10:59.342 --> 11:01.810
auto body shop on Franklin, and, uh,

11:01.835 --> 11:04.770
Gus Novak, but I have no idea
where he landed after prison.

11:04.814 --> 11:05.981
All right, all right, thank...
I'll let you know

11:06.022 --> 11:08.056
- how it shakes out.
- Hey, uh, Street, hold up.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.622
Listen, I... I know you think
that you owe me one,

11:11.647 --> 11:13.288
but you really don't.

11:13.322 --> 11:15.801
Okay? I was in a tough spot, too.

11:15.826 --> 11:17.473
You helped me just as much
as I helped you,

11:17.498 --> 11:19.494
so we're good.

11:19.529 --> 11:21.129
I know.

11:21.164 --> 11:23.231
That's why we're friends.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.838
You must be Darryl's mom.

11:30.329 --> 11:31.849
Justine.

11:31.874 --> 11:33.275
You're Hondo.

11:33.309 --> 11:36.278
Used to hear about you from my ex.

11:36.312 --> 11:38.079
You still check in on Leroy?

11:38.114 --> 11:40.015
I drop in during visiting hours
now and again.

11:40.049 --> 11:42.250
You said, uh, Darryl needed something?

11:42.285 --> 11:45.020
Listen, I didn't want to alarm
you over the phone,

11:45.054 --> 11:46.254
but Darryl got stabbed

11:46.289 --> 11:48.227
- in juvenile detention earlier today.
- My son got hurt?

11:48.252 --> 11:50.292
He's expected to recover just fine.

11:51.259 --> 11:52.928
Do you think that we
could speak in private?

11:54.630 --> 11:55.764
This way.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.799
<i>Maybe I wasn't the best mom,</i>

11:57.833 --> 11:59.367
but you try raising a child

11:59.402 --> 12:02.176
with someone like Leroy as an example.

12:02.559 --> 12:03.964
And last I heard,

12:04.006 --> 12:06.339
Darryl wasn't getting out
of juvie till he was 17.

12:06.364 --> 12:07.549
The judge I spoke to

12:07.574 --> 12:09.811
is willing to release him early
into your custody.

12:10.660 --> 12:13.481
Well... I don't think
that'd be a good idea,

12:13.516 --> 12:15.650
for either of us.

12:15.685 --> 12:18.320
Me chirping in Darryl's ear
only sets him off,

12:18.354 --> 12:20.989
sends him out searching for trouble,

12:21.023 --> 12:23.658
and I don't want that
in my home no more.

12:24.919 --> 12:26.289
Got too much Leroy in him.

12:26.314 --> 12:28.749
Darryl doesn't have to end up
like his father.

12:29.365 --> 12:30.799
Deep down,

12:30.833 --> 12:32.634
there's still a good kid in there.

12:35.438 --> 12:38.640
He was so sweet when he was small.

12:38.674 --> 12:40.875
Scared of his own shadow.

12:42.209 --> 12:43.745
But...

12:43.810 --> 12:47.048
but between Leroy and the
all-stars I was bringing around,

12:47.083 --> 12:48.817
Darryl saw lots of men acting up.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.553
Started acting up himself.

12:51.587 --> 12:55.190
And once that started,
I couldn't control it.

12:55.224 --> 12:58.660
See, Darryl's never really saw
what it means to be a man,

12:58.694 --> 13:00.195
not a real man.

13:00.229 --> 13:03.365
And I-I partly blame myself for that.

13:03.399 --> 13:05.500
But now Darryl is grown.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.736
He made his own choices,
same as his father.

13:07.770 --> 13:09.771
If you had seen him today,

13:09.805 --> 13:13.041
you'd recognize that he's still
just a scared little boy.

13:13.075 --> 13:14.175
Darryl wants to change.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.844
He just needs you to
take a chance on him.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.946
You're still his mother.

13:19.433 --> 13:22.493
Why are you spending time on this?

13:23.252 --> 13:25.320
Because I want to see Darryl make it.

13:27.757 --> 13:31.593
And, what, the court just gonna
let me take him back?

13:31.619 --> 13:32.819
Just like that?

13:41.270 --> 13:43.238
Those are custodial papers.

13:43.272 --> 13:44.906
All you have to do is sign.

13:44.940 --> 13:47.542
The court needs to know
you'll take him in.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.745
Just take some time and think about it.

13:52.481 --> 13:54.849
And then you let me know
what you decide.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.087
Well, you seem fine to me.

14:01.112 --> 14:02.490
You're not so injured you can't pay back

14:02.525 --> 14:03.758
the money you borrowed from me.

14:03.793 --> 14:06.995
No, my boss is just
being overly cautious.

14:07.029 --> 14:09.731
Once I get back in the field,
I can, I can collect overtime.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.232
My paychecks will be bigger,

14:11.267 --> 14:13.101
I can get an advance on the first few,

14:13.135 --> 14:14.769
and cover what I owe you, every cent.

14:15.578 --> 14:17.421
The deadline was the end of the month.

14:17.446 --> 14:18.965
That came and went.
I've been more than patient.

14:19.008 --> 14:20.742
And I'm grateful. I-I just...

14:20.776 --> 14:23.778
I wasn't expecting ten weeks
of base salary with no OT.

14:23.813 --> 14:26.181
So you're not here to pay me back?

14:26.215 --> 14:29.084
To pay off anything?

14:29.118 --> 14:32.153
I didn't even want to lend you
that money, but you insisted.

14:32.188 --> 14:34.456
What was I gonna do,
say "Screw you" to a cop?

14:34.490 --> 14:35.690
So you could come in here

14:35.725 --> 14:39.627
with your pals and jam me
on some BS parole violation?

14:39.662 --> 14:41.096
You made me give you that cash,

14:41.130 --> 14:42.287
and now you're not gonna pay it back?

14:42.319 --> 14:43.521
How is that any different
than robbing me?

14:43.546 --> 14:44.923
No, I'm not... I...

14:44.962 --> 14:47.936
I just... I'm asking
for more time, an extension.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.838
An extension?

14:49.872 --> 14:51.940
Does this look
like a private equity firm?

14:51.974 --> 14:55.240
Do you know how people who don't
pay their debts in my world

14:55.265 --> 14:56.811
are usually treated?

14:56.846 --> 14:59.047
The position that you're putting
me in is gonna cause problems

14:59.081 --> 15:01.116
with my backers. You're not
the only one with a boss.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.953
And as soon as I get the cash,
it's yours, I promise.

15:10.426 --> 15:11.826
Well...

15:11.861 --> 15:13.795
if I went to your employer
and explained,

15:13.829 --> 15:15.997
maybe I could, uh,
get the money from them?

15:17.267 --> 15:20.828
Yeah, if they knew that you
shook me down, threatened me,

15:20.853 --> 15:22.275
forced me to loan you this money...

15:22.314 --> 15:24.047
Hey, come on, that's not what happened.

15:24.072 --> 15:25.807
Isn't it?

15:26.290 --> 15:28.419
Are you sure that's not
how it's gonna look to them?

15:29.134 --> 15:30.812
You think you have problems now,

15:30.837 --> 15:33.081
wait till you're suspended without pay.

15:33.115 --> 15:35.650
And these investigations, you know,

15:35.684 --> 15:37.719
they-they could go on for months.

15:37.753 --> 15:39.687
Longer when the lawyers get into it.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.058
What do you want from me?

15:44.488 --> 15:46.151
You want an extension,

15:46.186 --> 15:48.587
well, then we need
to work something out,

15:48.631 --> 15:51.065
and if it's not cash, then a favor.

15:51.582 --> 15:53.101
What kind of favor?

15:54.493 --> 15:55.762
It's for my mother.

15:57.406 --> 16:00.108
She lives on Holland Avenue,
the, uh, 600 block.

16:00.142 --> 16:02.010
There's some losers in the house
on the corner,

16:02.044 --> 16:03.678
they're running an illegal poker game.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.614
People are going in and out
all hours of the night.

16:06.649 --> 16:08.212
And I-I think it could be
more than cards.

16:08.237 --> 16:09.892
Drugs, girls, who knows? But these guys,

16:09.917 --> 16:12.452
they're-they're taking down
the whole neighborhood.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.422
My mom, she's lived there for 30 years.

16:14.457 --> 16:16.591
Now she's scared to go
out and get her mail.

16:17.358 --> 16:20.631
So, you're gonna get
some of your cop pals

16:21.063 --> 16:23.465
to go down there and check it out,

16:23.499 --> 16:25.600
and we'll call that
this week's juice payment.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.487
If these guys are breaking the
law, they'll be taken care of.

16:33.142 --> 16:35.724
But let me be clear,
this is the one and only time

16:35.763 --> 16:38.913
that I act on an anonymous tip
from you. You understand?

16:45.821 --> 16:46.888
You the only one here?

16:46.922 --> 16:48.530
Mechanics are all at lunch.

16:48.555 --> 16:50.124
Anyone by the name of Diesel work here?

16:50.159 --> 16:53.358
No. Not since I started here
a couple years ago.

16:53.383 --> 16:54.470
Think we could get a list

16:54.497 --> 16:55.830
of all your full-
and part-time employees?

16:55.865 --> 16:58.533
Assistant manager should be
out back having a smoke.

17:21.223 --> 17:22.887
Rabbit! Tan!

17:22.992 --> 17:25.059
LAPD! Stop!

17:30.299 --> 17:32.408
On your stomach.

17:34.803 --> 17:35.947
Get your ass up.

17:36.906 --> 17:38.973
Diesel Hayes.

17:39.008 --> 17:41.142
You've been helping hack
into these stolen vehicles?

17:41.176 --> 17:43.177
Where are the carjackers?

17:43.212 --> 17:44.835
Who's telling you which rides to track?

17:44.860 --> 17:46.714
Screw you guys. I want my lawyer.

17:49.518 --> 17:51.867
"19th hole, WHCC"?

17:51.892 --> 17:53.983
Woodland Hills Country Club.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.194
Mumford, Rocker, take the A-side.

18:05.219 --> 18:07.874
We got no idea which car
they're after, so we check every one.

18:07.899 --> 18:09.837
As soon as these guys
pop up, we hit 'em.

18:09.872 --> 18:11.940
They won't go easy, so
we got to strike fast, man.

18:13.409 --> 18:14.542
- Right there, right there.
- Yup.

18:14.577 --> 18:16.644
Same description as the other
getaway car they were using.

18:16.679 --> 18:17.712
Hood's still warm.

18:17.738 --> 18:19.806
They got to be here somewhere.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.115
Eyes!

18:22.685 --> 18:24.819
- Gun! Gun!
- Gun!

18:32.227 --> 18:33.394
Officer down!

18:35.431 --> 18:36.731
Mumford, you all right?

18:36.756 --> 18:38.725
I'm okay. I think they got my helmet.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.734
Luca, move.

18:39.768 --> 18:41.836
Hey, how many?

18:41.870 --> 18:43.137
Get out of here with that.

18:45.908 --> 18:48.042
Shots fired. 20-David in pursuit.

19:01.624 --> 19:02.690
Damn, these guys are moving.

19:07.463 --> 19:09.139
Well, they got the faster car,

19:09.164 --> 19:11.499
- but we got the better driver.
- All right, prove it, big dawg.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.937
Gun!

19:25.514 --> 19:26.681
- All right, now?
- Now.

19:28.860 --> 19:30.523
Three feet.

19:31.487 --> 19:32.813
One foot.

19:37.938 --> 19:40.128
Go, go, go. Go-go right there, go.

19:43.032 --> 19:45.266
- LAPD! Stop!
- Go.

19:46.802 --> 19:48.403
- Get the hell out of the car!
- Get out now!

19:50.706 --> 19:51.906
- Go, go, go!
- Drop the gun!

19:51.940 --> 19:53.141
Hey, drop the weapon now!

19:53.175 --> 19:54.642
All right, all right, all right.

19:54.677 --> 19:56.144
Get down! Down!

19:56.178 --> 19:57.645
You're done!

19:57.680 --> 19:59.814
- Luca, you good?
- Yeah, got him.

20:08.781 --> 20:11.082
What the hell is that?

20:17.533 --> 20:19.100
Boss, take a look.

20:23.162 --> 20:24.582
Heroin.

20:29.597 --> 20:31.545
Hey, I talked to Detective Schumacher.

20:31.614 --> 20:33.910
Lamborghini arrived
from Panama last week,

20:33.935 --> 20:35.286
same as all the other stolen cars.

20:35.316 --> 20:37.066
Heroin must've been
loaded in down there,

20:37.091 --> 20:38.581
hidden in the vehicles.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.740
Man, all these cars came
in on the same container ship,

20:41.775 --> 20:43.876
delivered straight to their buyers.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.744
What kind of geniuses
pack heroin inside cars

20:45.787 --> 20:47.254
that are about as
discreet as Kardashians?

20:47.280 --> 20:49.481
- I don't know.
- Something feels off.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.917
I guess, if every car
has a haul like this,

20:51.951 --> 20:53.585
they not only make millions
off the drugs,

20:53.620 --> 20:54.820
but they can unload the parts

20:54.854 --> 20:56.722
for tens of thousands
on the black market.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.990
So this crew gets paid twice.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.091
Everything goes as planned,

20:59.116 --> 21:00.592
they're having their cake, eating it,

21:00.627 --> 21:02.316
then selling the plate it was served on.

21:03.316 --> 21:05.409
These carjackers aren't done yet.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.900
One of my detectives
talked to the supervisor

21:07.934 --> 21:09.635
who checked in that
shipment of vehicles.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.262
He's positive there were eight
cars on that boat, not seven.

21:12.287 --> 21:13.418
Wait, so there's another car

21:13.443 --> 21:14.773
packed with heroin still out there?

21:14.808 --> 21:16.842
- What kind of vehicle?
- He couldn't tell.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.644
It was midnight and
the cars were covered,

21:18.678 --> 21:21.079
but he swears up and
down he counted eight.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.115
Well, before these cars
even come off the ship,

21:23.149 --> 21:25.184
they're each assigned
a customs import marker.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.270
Those markers only record
a car's make and model,

21:27.295 --> 21:28.449
not its VIN number.

21:28.474 --> 21:30.932
Yeah, but the make and model
is something to go on.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.859
I mean, cars this nice, they're
rare enough, even in L.A.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.093
<i>Hey, Hondo.</i>

21:35.128 --> 21:36.829
Some woman left this
for you at the front.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.630
She wanted you to know it's been signed.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.032
Appreciate it.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.441
You know, could use your
instincts out there today.

21:42.512 --> 21:44.356
It's gonna take more than luck
to get ahead of these guys.

21:44.441 --> 21:46.038
Trust me, I'm itching to get back.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.770
Street seemed to rise
to the occasion, though.

21:47.832 --> 21:49.282
Come on, man, you know Street.

21:49.344 --> 21:51.289
Nothing lights his eyes
up more than fast cars.

21:51.321 --> 21:52.878
Well, then today's his day, then.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.681
Right. Hey, how'd Mumford
seem when he got back?

21:55.715 --> 21:57.282
Uh, he seemed fine.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.295
Filed an incident report, went back out.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.006
His team found what looks
like the drop site

22:01.031 --> 22:02.354
for the rest of the stolen vehicles.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.822
It's a rail yard east of downtown.

22:03.857 --> 22:05.290
There were six sets of tire tracks,

22:05.325 --> 22:06.658
but no rides, no bad guys.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.018
Hey, you get anything useful

22:08.043 --> 22:09.416
from the boys in the Lamborghini?

22:09.441 --> 22:11.072
One's in surgery.
The other one's being booked,

22:11.097 --> 22:12.166
but he's not talking.

22:12.191 --> 22:14.143
Same as the guy who was hacking
the GPS satellites.

22:14.168 --> 22:15.300
He's already lawyered up.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.802
The D.A. couldn't cut a deal to find out

22:16.836 --> 22:17.870
which drug ring these guys worked for?

22:17.904 --> 22:19.872
No, and the chem test they did

22:19.906 --> 22:21.406
on the heroin doesn't match anything

22:21.441 --> 22:23.041
in the DEA's database,

22:23.076 --> 22:24.710
neither does the label.
I mean, they think

22:24.744 --> 22:26.378
whoever's importing it
is new to the scene.

22:26.412 --> 22:27.880
Well, whoever they are,
they got resources,

22:27.914 --> 22:28.881
and they're making noise.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.015
Get Narcotics in,

22:30.049 --> 22:31.984
find out what they heard on the street.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.888
Galvin, great to see you.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.090
Belated congrats on the promotion.

22:38.124 --> 22:41.193
Thanks, Deac. How you been?
How's Annie and the kid?

22:41.227 --> 22:43.802
Kids, with an "S." Four, actually.

22:43.827 --> 22:44.856
- Four?
- Yeah.

22:44.881 --> 22:47.032
Wow. Better man than me.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.434
Said you had a question you
wanted to ask me in person?

22:49.469 --> 22:50.869
Yeah, I want to show you something.

22:50.904 --> 22:52.404
You ever hear of the cartels

22:52.438 --> 22:54.373
pushing their heroin
using imported cars?

22:54.407 --> 22:58.043
Can't say I have,
but I can run it by my team.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.141
Have 'em take a look at this, too.

23:00.166 --> 23:01.641
The drugs we picked up,

23:01.666 --> 23:03.508
they all have the logo
of a mountain on them.

23:03.533 --> 23:05.017
That's a volcano.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.052
An old mobster, Albert Tosca,

23:07.078 --> 23:08.512
my sources said he talked about pushing

23:08.554 --> 23:10.088
this new stuff he called "volcano."

23:10.123 --> 23:11.577
So he's got to be the one behind this.

23:11.602 --> 23:12.913
Not likely.

23:12.938 --> 23:15.861
Found him executed Mafia-style
last week in San Pedro.

23:17.263 --> 23:18.563
Albert Tosca used to be part

23:18.598 --> 23:20.132
of Lorenzo Bettiga's crime syndicate.

23:20.174 --> 23:22.602
The Bettigas terrorized
Southwest L.A. for years.

23:22.627 --> 23:24.665
Fled back to Sicily two decades ago.

23:24.690 --> 23:26.872
Galvin said Tosca
planned to push a new batch

23:26.906 --> 23:29.207
- he was calling "volcano."
- He also said that Tosca stole

23:29.242 --> 23:30.976
his heroin down in Panama,
repackaged it,

23:31.010 --> 23:33.829
and then diverted it to L.A.
using luxury cars.

23:33.854 --> 23:36.040
Guessing that didn't go over
too well with his boss.

23:36.065 --> 23:38.116
Probably thought Bettiga
couldn't track him to the States.

23:38.151 --> 23:39.385
Yeah, well, he thought wrong, okay?

23:39.410 --> 23:40.872
These guys don't just cut their losses.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.600
No, they also cut up
the guys who screwed 'em.

23:42.625 --> 23:44.877
See that? "Traditore" scrawled in blood.

23:44.902 --> 23:47.547
Means traitor. Worst thing
you can be to the mob,

23:47.572 --> 23:48.961
- other than a cop.
- By the time they figured out

23:48.995 --> 23:50.353
what Tosca had done with the heroin,

23:50.378 --> 23:51.737
the cars had already been
delivered to their owners.

23:51.762 --> 23:53.598
So they hired car thieves and a hacker

23:53.633 --> 23:55.743
- to steal back their product.
- Who's the pretty boy?

23:55.768 --> 23:57.402
That's Il Monaco, The Monk.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.463
It's Bettiga's hit man.

23:58.488 --> 24:00.826
Interpol suspects he's killed
30 people since 2001.

24:00.851 --> 24:02.507
Notify border patrol and airports

24:02.534 --> 24:03.927
- in case they try to flee.
- I got a feeling

24:03.974 --> 24:05.844
they're not ready to leave
the country just yet.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.813
Not until they get what they want.

24:07.870 --> 24:10.686
Chris, you at the import lot?

24:10.718 --> 24:13.159
Just left. We got the make
and model of the final car

24:13.186 --> 24:15.310
off the shipment, a silver Ferrari 458.

24:15.335 --> 24:17.830
We'll start pulling GPS signals
for every matching car in L.A.

24:17.855 --> 24:18.855
<i>We can't.</i>

24:18.880 --> 24:20.174
Manufacturer said their satellite

24:20.199 --> 24:22.400
was just breached by someone
fishing for the same intel.

24:22.425 --> 24:24.980
Said it's gonna take a while
to get the signals back online.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.240
How'd the mob hack a satellite
when we have their hacker

24:27.273 --> 24:28.776
<i>in custody?</i>

24:28.809 --> 24:30.705
<i>Wait, what about Street's friend?</i>

24:31.178 --> 24:34.052
Whip, you here, man? It's Street.

24:36.956 --> 24:39.024
Whip?

24:40.093 --> 24:42.027
Whip?

24:44.998 --> 24:48.433
LAPD. Anyone here?

24:48.468 --> 24:50.035
Whip?

24:53.226 --> 24:55.440
26-David to Command.

24:55.475 --> 24:57.109
I need a unit and a supervisor

24:57.143 --> 24:59.890
to respond to 1017 Lewis Avenue.

24:59.937 --> 25:01.880
Probable abduction.

25:06.030 --> 25:08.601
Should've been there. I should've known

25:08.633 --> 25:09.937
that Whip would be on the radar

25:09.962 --> 25:12.369
of whoever was after cars like this.

25:12.403 --> 25:14.565
The Italians need Whip
to track that Ferrari.

25:14.590 --> 25:15.746
They're not gonna hurt him.

25:15.785 --> 25:16.762
Not yet.

25:16.794 --> 25:18.082
As soon as they get their hands

25:18.107 --> 25:19.676
on that last car,
they'll get rid of him.

25:19.701 --> 25:22.365
Then we're gonna do whatever we
can to keep that from happening.

25:22.410 --> 25:24.662
None of this is your fault, kid.

25:25.536 --> 25:28.171
You know, I never figured
the two of you for friends.

25:28.524 --> 25:32.093
You know, when I was younger,
most of my friends were losers.

25:32.118 --> 25:33.676
Not a lot of brain power in that crowd.

25:33.711 --> 25:35.202
You know what I mean?

25:35.227 --> 25:37.665
Then Buck gave me some advice,
he said that if you...

25:37.727 --> 25:39.282
If you feel like the smartest
person in the room,

25:39.316 --> 25:40.683
then you're in the wrong room.

25:40.718 --> 25:42.118
He told me that, too.

25:42.152 --> 25:45.088
Right. And ever since then,

25:45.122 --> 25:48.391
I try to hang with people
who make me up my game,

25:48.425 --> 25:50.860
and that's Whip, man. He just...

25:50.894 --> 25:53.229
He functions on a higher
bandwidth than the rest of us,

25:53.259 --> 25:55.465
and once you get to know
him, he's a good guy,

25:55.499 --> 25:57.632
and he went to the mat for me
when he didn't have to.

25:57.657 --> 25:58.901
- He saved my life.
- All right, well,

25:58.936 --> 26:00.637
let's just hope he uses
whatever tools he's got

26:00.671 --> 26:01.938
at his disposal to reach us.

26:02.621 --> 26:04.774
And what's plan B?

26:04.808 --> 26:06.743
We find someone else to track this car.

26:09.079 --> 26:10.246
Okay.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.649
Look, I've seen enough Scorsese films

26:12.683 --> 26:15.752
to know not to get between
Sicilians and money.

26:15.777 --> 26:18.229
- This is your last chance to talk.
- Got nothing else to say.

26:18.270 --> 26:20.323
- Give us something we can go...
- I've got nothing else to say.

26:20.357 --> 26:21.424
Our techs are digging

26:21.458 --> 26:23.826
through the equipment you used
to track these cars,

26:23.861 --> 26:25.139
everything in that garage.

26:25.164 --> 26:26.749
As soon as we find what we're after,

26:26.774 --> 26:29.275
you'll have zero leverage
with the D.A. None.

26:31.769 --> 26:35.471
I bet you're after the Ferrari 458.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.607
Listen, I'm a decent hacker,

26:37.641 --> 26:39.275
but only a genius can track a car

26:39.309 --> 26:41.202
without a GPS transponder inside.

26:41.227 --> 26:42.679
Someone who can afford a ride like that

26:42.713 --> 26:44.814
doesn't want the ability
to locate it? Makes no sense.

26:44.848 --> 26:46.770
Makes no sense?

26:47.885 --> 26:49.686
Whoever customized the car

26:49.720 --> 26:51.521
paid to import it illegally,

26:51.555 --> 26:53.366
wants it off the grid.

26:53.391 --> 26:57.093
Probably some ex-con
out on parole hiding his assets.

26:57.127 --> 27:01.030
A better hacker can find
a way to locate it, but...

27:01.608 --> 27:02.965
I can't.

27:03.299 --> 27:05.034
Go figure, right?

27:05.069 --> 27:07.336
A car loaded with heroin

27:07.361 --> 27:09.305
winds up being driven by a criminal

27:09.330 --> 27:11.874
who has no clue what he's sitting on.

27:12.517 --> 27:14.214
What kind of bad guy's even rich enough

27:14.239 --> 27:16.103
to buy wheels like that
in the first place, huh?

27:16.146 --> 27:17.847
You're joking, right?

27:19.497 --> 27:21.217
This is L.A.

27:21.521 --> 27:23.453
Every ex-con in the city living

27:23.487 --> 27:25.248
at a million dollar-plus residence.

27:25.273 --> 27:27.269
Of those homes, here are
the ones with one or more

27:27.294 --> 27:29.347
registered vehicles costing
over a hundred grand.

27:29.372 --> 27:31.794
- Should help us narrow it down.
- What's going on there?

27:31.829 --> 27:34.011
It's just a home
detention monitor got tripped.

27:34.036 --> 27:35.507
Cops'll go by and check it out.

27:35.532 --> 27:37.233
What, you think it means something?

27:37.258 --> 27:38.889
Home detention, like, uh, house arrest?

27:38.914 --> 27:39.959
Yeah.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.306
Whip knows how to hack
into those systems.

27:43.340 --> 27:44.540
Whoever lives in that house,

27:44.575 --> 27:46.642
Whip is using their
detention monitor to signal us.

27:46.668 --> 27:49.503
- Are you sure?
- No, but what if he is?

27:49.546 --> 27:51.214
Get down there.

27:54.075 --> 27:56.910
All right, 27502 Chestnut Ridge.

27:56.954 --> 27:59.088
Residence of Puck Marlow and six

27:59.123 --> 28:00.990
associates who have healthy
rap sheets of their own.

28:01.024 --> 28:02.825
Puck Marlow, rapper-slash-mogul?

28:02.860 --> 28:04.594
Slash convicted felon, yeah.

28:04.628 --> 28:05.995
He's gonna have his entire posse there.

28:06.038 --> 28:08.240
- Fully loaded probably, too.
- Who's he roll with?

28:08.265 --> 28:09.532
20th Street Hammers.

28:09.566 --> 28:11.072
Marlow's crew might be the one group

28:11.097 --> 28:12.668
crazy enough to shoot it out
with the mob.

28:12.703 --> 28:14.604
Yeah, and they'll have
the firepower to do it.

28:14.638 --> 28:16.672
Italians have no clue
what they're walking into.

28:16.707 --> 28:18.341
So that's why no one makes a move

28:18.375 --> 28:19.776
until we're sure the mob's made theirs.

28:19.810 --> 28:21.711
Now, reports show that Marlow spent

28:21.745 --> 28:24.247
the past few years turning this
place into a fortified playpen.

28:24.281 --> 28:25.681
Things could heat up fast.

28:25.716 --> 28:27.383
And Whip's right in the middle of it.

28:27.417 --> 28:28.651
We'll get to him in time.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.411
<i>You sure the Ferrari's here?</i>

28:39.436 --> 28:42.431
Yeah, yeah. I mean, uh,
the emergency tracker

28:42.466 --> 28:43.567
built into it says that

28:43.592 --> 28:44.872
it's somewhere on the property.

28:44.897 --> 28:48.371
- How much longer till you get us in?
- Um...

28:48.405 --> 28:50.273
Hang on. I am...

28:50.298 --> 28:52.199
fusing the local connection

28:52.242 --> 28:53.643
to the security systems...

28:53.677 --> 28:55.545
I don't care what you're doing,

28:56.313 --> 28:57.973
just do it faster.

29:02.076 --> 29:04.722
Yo, I'm about to do some work,
so don't bother me.

29:04.747 --> 29:05.755
<i>I got you, boss.</i>

29:05.789 --> 29:07.456
<i>Everything's locked up tight here.</i>

29:14.464 --> 29:16.966
<i>♪ He all about the chases,
it's only right we excha... ♪</i>

29:18.708 --> 29:20.570
And... we're in.

29:22.706 --> 29:24.974
Get your lazy ass up, man,
make me something to drink.

29:25.008 --> 29:27.143
Boss says he's busy.

29:30.544 --> 29:31.805
Check this out.

29:31.849 --> 29:33.983
Looks like somebody left in a hurry.

29:47.036 --> 29:49.997
That jacket, that's Whip's.

29:51.028 --> 29:53.302
If they broke in the house,
they probably took Whip.

29:53.337 --> 29:54.837
- We got to get to him.
- Come on.

30:01.436 --> 30:02.812
Mumford, line us up.

30:31.608 --> 30:34.977
26-David, I got visual
on Whip in the upstairs room.

30:35.012 --> 30:36.573
- Is anyone with him?
- Two of 'em.

30:36.597 --> 30:37.680
I think one of them's Bettiga.

30:37.681 --> 30:38.814
All right, see if you guys
can get to him

30:38.849 --> 30:40.620
<i>from the A-side with Mumford's team.</i>

30:40.659 --> 30:42.460
<i>We'll head upstairs around back.</i>

31:12.649 --> 31:13.983
Where are the keys to the Ferrari?!

31:15.953 --> 31:17.086
I don't know, man!

31:23.994 --> 31:25.227
Damn, she's a beauty.

31:28.550 --> 31:29.565
Stay down.

31:41.511 --> 31:43.618
LAPD! Drop your weapon!

32:18.015 --> 32:19.505
Stevens! Cover me!

34:22.685 --> 34:27.435
Now, count to ten,
and then start screaming.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.735
<i>♪ You alone, so I move, now
you cryin' there with me... ♪</i>

34:32.768 --> 34:34.737
- Police!
- Hands where we can see 'em!

34:34.771 --> 34:36.772
- On the ground! Get on the ground now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:36.806 --> 34:37.815
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the floor!

34:37.840 --> 34:38.940
- Get on the floor!
- Look, man...

34:38.975 --> 34:40.775
Hands behind your back!

34:40.810 --> 34:43.246
Help! Help!

34:43.272 --> 34:44.279
- You good?
- Yeah.

34:47.121 --> 34:49.618
I'm in the bedroom!

34:49.652 --> 34:51.585
Please, please help!

34:52.822 --> 34:53.822
LAPD! SWAT!

34:56.626 --> 34:57.826
Whip, you're okay.

34:57.870 --> 35:00.038
You're okay, we got you.

35:00.063 --> 35:01.769
Bathroom's clear.

35:02.524 --> 35:04.858
We have Whip. He's safe.

35:04.901 --> 35:06.468
Bettiga... where'd he go?

35:06.502 --> 35:07.669
To get the Ferrari.

35:15.178 --> 35:17.124
LAPD!

35:17.647 --> 35:18.947
End of the line, Bettiga.

35:39.369 --> 35:41.083
We'll keep a couple
officers stationed outside

35:41.108 --> 35:42.170
for tonight.

35:42.205 --> 35:44.011
Oh, and your brother's on his way over.

35:44.035 --> 35:45.213
Great.

35:45.238 --> 35:46.708
- How you feeling?
- Been better.

35:46.743 --> 35:49.311
But, uh, could've been a lot worse.

35:49.345 --> 35:51.246
- How you feeling?
- Same.

35:51.290 --> 35:53.091
- Right.
- Thanks.

35:53.116 --> 35:55.758
Oh, man.

35:55.789 --> 35:56.983
Who would've thought
knowing how to break out

35:57.008 --> 35:58.233
of a court-issued ankle monitor

35:58.258 --> 35:59.513
could save your life, huh?

35:59.555 --> 36:02.524
This is, like, what you do
every day? 'Cause that's crazy.

36:02.558 --> 36:05.260
No. Only when I'm lucky.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.335
Listen, I, uh, I don't want to keep you

36:10.360 --> 36:12.777
if you've got s-stuff to take care of.

36:12.802 --> 36:13.902
No, man, it's cool.

36:13.936 --> 36:15.604
All right.

36:15.638 --> 36:17.789
Happy to hang out.

36:21.277 --> 36:23.345
Did you see some of the cars
that guy had in his garage?

36:23.379 --> 36:27.127
Oh, my God. Dude,
don't even get me started.

36:27.152 --> 36:28.200
Oh.

36:31.821 --> 36:33.455
Good to see you today.

36:33.489 --> 36:34.837
Give my best to Annie and the brood.

36:34.868 --> 36:37.555
I will. You say hi to Liz.

36:42.288 --> 36:43.722
Hey, Galvin.

36:45.668 --> 36:49.382
I, uh... I had a tip come in
from an old CI.

36:49.444 --> 36:51.139
He thinks there's a drug distro house

36:51.174 --> 36:52.618
in his elderly mom's neighborhood.

36:52.643 --> 36:53.673
Really? Where?

36:53.698 --> 36:55.944
Uh, Holland Avenue. Ramona Gardens.

36:55.978 --> 36:57.245
The 600 block, right on the corner.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.647
I know that area well.

36:58.681 --> 37:00.689
Thanks, Deac. We'll check it out.

37:05.354 --> 37:07.689
Come in.

37:11.319 --> 37:12.653
Hell of a day, Jack.

37:12.678 --> 37:13.879
Hell of a night.

37:13.904 --> 37:16.965
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.

37:16.999 --> 37:18.266
What's on your mind?

37:20.770 --> 37:23.438
I'm done. I can't do this anymore.

37:23.473 --> 37:24.973
You can't do what?

37:25.007 --> 37:26.608
You mean SWAT?

37:26.642 --> 37:28.015
Yeah.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.687
You've had close calls before.

37:29.712 --> 37:32.581
- Yeah, you'll shake it off, Jack.
- No, this is different.

37:32.615 --> 37:34.116
Take some time off.

37:34.150 --> 37:36.618
- Think about it.
- Yeah, it's a big decision to make.

37:36.652 --> 37:39.321
Come on, especially after
a day like today.

37:41.557 --> 37:43.625
I'm turning in my 30-day notice,

37:43.746 --> 37:46.381
so pick another team leader,

37:46.406 --> 37:51.333
whether it's Deacon
or Rocker... whoever.

37:51.367 --> 37:52.334
Are you really sure?

37:56.609 --> 38:00.651
Truth is... I can't
keep up with these guys.

38:00.676 --> 38:03.278
I work my ass off trying,

38:03.312 --> 38:06.681
but sooner or later,
something's gonna happen.

38:06.716 --> 38:08.552
We all know how it ended up with Buck.

38:08.577 --> 38:10.388
Oh, come on.

38:11.302 --> 38:14.549
I'd rather leave a day too
early than a day too late.

38:16.425 --> 38:17.924
You told Nikki yet?

38:18.549 --> 38:22.315
No, but she'll be relieved.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.301
It won't be the same without you.

38:26.335 --> 38:27.903
We can't talk you out of it?

38:27.937 --> 38:29.771
No.

38:31.329 --> 38:34.598
Yeah. End of an era, Jack.

38:36.445 --> 38:37.846
We'll miss you, Sergeant.

38:38.442 --> 38:40.243
Captain.

38:42.198 --> 38:43.799
Commander.

38:53.930 --> 38:56.198
I don't know, I haven't
seen her in, like, a year.

38:56.232 --> 38:58.733
Trust me, Darryl, she's
still gonna recognize you.

38:58.768 --> 39:00.648
She's gonna be nervous, too.
You hear me?

39:00.673 --> 39:01.703
Yeah.

39:01.704 --> 39:03.505
It's gonna take some getting used to.

39:09.078 --> 39:10.245
There he is.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.591
My Darryl.

39:15.084 --> 39:17.261
He gonna try to sell us a Bible?

39:17.296 --> 39:19.130
I'm sorry, sir. You are?

39:19.155 --> 39:21.289
Uh, Ronald. And you are?

39:21.324 --> 39:22.724
My name's Hondo.

39:22.758 --> 39:24.392
Ah.

39:24.427 --> 39:25.860
You live here, too?

39:26.740 --> 39:29.030
He's been staying lately.

39:29.065 --> 39:33.102
Uh, hi, sir. My name's Darryl.
Nice to meet you.

39:34.727 --> 39:37.305
Darryl here is a new man.

39:37.340 --> 39:39.574
He's gonna get a fresh start,
ain't that right?

39:39.609 --> 39:41.806
Well... well, come on inside.

39:41.831 --> 39:44.546
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's get some things in order first.

39:44.580 --> 39:47.215
- How long you plan to stay?
- Ronald, don't.

39:47.250 --> 39:49.084
I-I don't know yet, sir.

39:49.118 --> 39:50.752
He's gonna finish up school next year.

39:50.786 --> 39:52.587
What? You said a month or two.

39:52.622 --> 39:54.322
You didn't speak no nonsense
about him staying a year.

39:54.357 --> 39:56.986
I said we'd figure it out.
Nothing's final.

39:57.011 --> 39:58.564
I-I already raised my kids,

39:58.589 --> 40:00.061
and no one is paying me
to raise another man's.

40:00.096 --> 40:02.597
It's okay. You know what?

40:02.632 --> 40:04.466
Listen, I think we're gonna
come back later.

40:08.699 --> 40:10.318
Darryl, let's go.

40:13.401 --> 40:16.310
Wait. Wait-wait a minute.

40:22.618 --> 40:26.921
Justine... it's okay.

40:28.958 --> 40:30.158
We'll call you later.

40:32.662 --> 40:33.662
Come on.

40:52.027 --> 40:54.149
Look at him go.

40:54.183 --> 40:57.113
Yeah, it's been a minute since
the kid's had a decent meal.

40:57.167 --> 40:59.077
You ate just like that
when you were his age.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.289
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

41:01.324 --> 41:03.325
What you trying to do with that boy?

41:07.997 --> 41:09.864
I don't know, Ma.

41:09.899 --> 41:11.700
Start with Social Services,

41:11.734 --> 41:13.806
try to find him a good foster situation.

41:13.831 --> 41:14.977
Mm-hmm.

41:15.002 --> 41:16.304
But you know that could take
a couple of days.

41:16.339 --> 41:18.039
- It might even take a week or so.
- Yeah.

41:21.017 --> 41:23.478
You think you could help me
look after him until then?

41:23.512 --> 41:25.146
You know I will.

41:25.173 --> 41:27.582
- That's my mama.
- Mm-hmm.

41:29.711 --> 41:32.205
Boy, you better inhale some
oxygen along with that food.

41:32.230 --> 41:33.605
Come on now, slow down.

41:33.630 --> 41:35.136
This is great, Mrs. Harrelson.

41:35.161 --> 41:37.007
There's plenty more where
that come from, Darryl,

41:37.032 --> 41:38.253
always more.

41:40.106 --> 41:41.896
There's something I wanted to ask you.

41:41.931 --> 41:43.815
What's up?

41:43.840 --> 41:46.401
I know you and my pops grew up the same.

41:46.435 --> 41:48.471
No money, no hookups.

41:48.496 --> 41:51.506
I know he was smart, too, even
if he didn't always show it.

41:51.550 --> 41:54.471
D, your pops was smart as hell.

41:54.496 --> 41:55.877
He still is.

41:55.911 --> 41:59.214
Then how come you made something
of yourself and he didn't?

42:03.452 --> 42:05.286
You're looking at her.

42:10.378 --> 42:11.779
Hey, Mama, you gonna spoil me, too,

42:11.804 --> 42:12.826
or I got to make my own plate?

42:12.851 --> 42:14.326
Oh, I'll make it for you.
You know that...

42:14.351 --> 42:17.057
- Oh, see, see, oh...
- Okay... oh...
