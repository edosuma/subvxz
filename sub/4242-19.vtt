00:01.349 --> 00:02.883
<i>So here's what you missed
on</i> Glee:

00:02.934 --> 00:04.885
<i>Rachel choked at her NYADA
audition, which meant she blew</i>

00:04.886 --> 00:06.270
<i>the biggest audition of her life.</i>
Oh, God.

00:06.271 --> 00:07.805
<i>Which, as far as
she's concerned, is now</i>

00:07.806 --> 00:09.423
<i>pretty much over.</i>
I had my chance and I choked.

00:09.424 --> 00:11.108
<i>Quinn's in a wheelchair,
but her rehab's going well,</i>

00:11.109 --> 00:12.560
<i>partly because Joe's been
going with her.</i>

00:12.561 --> 00:13.644
<i>Brittany probably
forgot she was</i>

00:13.645 --> 00:14.945
<i>elected senior class president.</i>

00:14.946 --> 00:16.363
<i>And Puck failed
his big geography exam</i>

00:16.364 --> 00:18.399
<i>about Iberian precipitation,</i>

00:18.400 --> 00:19.766
<i>which means
he's not gonna graduate.</i>

00:19.767 --> 00:20.934
<i>And that's what you missed
on</i> Glee.

00:23.722 --> 00:24.889
<i>Everything dies.</i>

00:24.890 --> 00:27.124
<i>Maybe the saddest death of all</i>

00:27.125 --> 00:28.742
<i>is the death of a dream.</i>

00:28.743 --> 00:32.796
<i>For 18 years, I've had
Broadway, stardom.</i>

00:32.797 --> 00:36.500
<i>It was like wings that kept me
hovering above the fray.</i>

00:36.585 --> 00:39.119
<i>But I flew too close to the sun
and now they're gone</i>

00:39.120 --> 00:42.473
<i>and I'm just Rachel
Barbra Berry of Lima, Ohio...</i>

00:42.474 --> 00:44.291
<i>a flightless bird.</i>

00:44.292 --> 00:46.126
<i>A penguin.</i>

00:46.127 --> 00:47.511
<i>Do I look different?</i>

00:47.512 --> 00:49.180
<i>I feel different.</i>

00:49.181 --> 00:52.933
<i>In some ways, it's a relief...
to be part of the crowd.</i>

00:52.934 --> 00:56.187
<i>My dreams are smaller now,
maybe even more real...</i>

00:56.188 --> 01:00.357
<i>the wedding, winning
Nationals... but first, prom.</i>

01:00.358 --> 01:02.276
<i>I'll never walk the red carpet</i>

01:02.327 --> 01:04.528
<i>as a Tony
or Golden Globe nominee.</i>

01:04.529 --> 01:06.614
<i>That's what you get
for having no backup plan.</i>

01:06.615 --> 01:08.982
<i>Prom is my night
to trip the light fantastic.</i>

01:08.983 --> 01:11.035
<i>Next to my wedding,
my prom dress will be</i>

01:11.036 --> 01:13.687
<i>the most important gown
I ever wear.</i>

01:13.688 --> 01:15.756
<i>I'm surprisingly
okay with it all.</i>

01:15.757 --> 01:18.325
<i>That dream was just a favorite
old sweater that I kept around</i>

01:18.326 --> 01:19.927
<i>even though
it didn't fit anymore.</i>

01:19.928 --> 01:21.749
<i>I can grieve it and move on.</i>

01:21.796 --> 01:25.182
<i>I may have lost NYADA,
but I still have Finn.</i>

01:25.183 --> 01:26.767
<i>So I'm not going to get</i>

01:26.768 --> 01:28.335
<i>everything I thought
I ever wanted.</i>

01:28.336 --> 01:29.637
<i>Doesn't make me a loser.</i>

01:33.441 --> 01:34.692
What are you doing?

01:34.693 --> 01:37.444
I am practicing my Prom
Queen victory wave.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.063
I'm going to win.

01:39.064 --> 01:41.515
You know, there's a lot of stiff
competition this year, Becky.

01:41.516 --> 01:43.103
I wouldn't want you
to be disappointed.

01:43.151 --> 01:46.120
Would you mind taking your
loser talk somewhere else?

01:46.121 --> 01:48.072
I don't want to
catch your failure.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.583 --> 01:59.967
Sexy teen trollop.

01:59.968 --> 02:01.168
Many months ago,

02:01.169 --> 02:02.369
to much fanfare,

02:02.370 --> 02:03.999
you were elected
senior class president.

02:04.005 --> 02:05.960
Oh, yeah.
Since that day,

02:06.007 --> 02:08.542
you have accomplished nothing
except one memorandum

02:08.543 --> 02:10.009
written in crayon saying

02:10.011 --> 02:11.465
"Drill, baby, drill."

02:11.513 --> 02:13.551
Yeah, I no longer believe we
should be drilling for babies.

02:13.598 --> 02:17.551
Your do-nothing presidency
has me seriously considering

02:17.552 --> 02:18.973
abolishing the post
altogether.

02:18.987 --> 02:20.554
And as you are flunking
each of your classes,

02:20.555 --> 02:22.606
you need class president

02:22.607 --> 02:26.146
on your transcript if you hope
to gain admittance into college.

02:26.194 --> 02:27.995
No, I don't. I've already
been accepted at Perdue.

02:27.996 --> 02:29.446
The university?

02:29.447 --> 02:31.098
No, the chicken factory.

02:31.099 --> 02:34.368
Miss Pierce,
you are making a mockery

02:34.369 --> 02:35.906
of this student government,

02:35.920 --> 02:39.072
and if you don't make an impact
with the rest of your term,

02:39.073 --> 02:42.092
your presidency will be
this school's last!

02:42.093 --> 02:45.512
I now realize I wasted an entire
year belaboring the nuances

02:45.513 --> 02:48.210
of my fluid teen sexuality
and getting caught up

02:48.216 --> 02:49.850
in Lord Tubbington's
Ponzi schemes.

02:49.851 --> 02:51.802
Then for a while,
I stopped talking.

02:51.803 --> 02:54.471
But I don't want my presidency
to be the last one at McKinley.

02:54.472 --> 02:56.176
I don't want that
to be my legacy.

02:56.191 --> 02:58.470
Well, Madame President,
prom is coming up.

02:58.526 --> 03:01.807
And if you want to
rehabilitate your image,

03:01.863 --> 03:03.697
perhaps that's where
you should start.

03:05.984 --> 03:07.146
Okay.

03:07.202 --> 03:10.204
I don't know
who any of you guys are.

03:10.205 --> 03:11.938
Oh, we're
the Prom Committee.

03:11.939 --> 03:14.441
We've been meeting
since September.

03:14.442 --> 03:16.280
We've sent
you 14 memos.

03:16.328 --> 03:18.579
Did you get my memo
about drilling for babies?

03:18.580 --> 03:19.380
No.

03:19.381 --> 03:20.547
Good. 'Cause that's not

03:20.548 --> 03:21.799
the solution
to soaring gas prices.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.051
We're a little behind schedule,

03:24.052 --> 03:26.837
but we think we have a great
theme for this year's prom.

03:26.921 --> 03:28.417
Cool.
This year's prom theme

03:28.456 --> 03:31.592
is...

03:31.593 --> 03:32.976
"Castles in the Clouds."

03:34.262 --> 03:36.013
Nice.

03:36.014 --> 03:37.631
I like your unicorns;
Those are great.

03:37.632 --> 03:39.633
But I'm gonna have to say never,

03:39.634 --> 03:41.568
'cause there's no way
I'm ever gonna let that happen.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.903
Castles are very heavy,

03:42.970 --> 03:45.305
so putting them on clouds
would be extremely dangerous.

03:45.306 --> 03:47.307
I seriously think the three of
you should be put in jail.

03:47.308 --> 03:48.437
Okay.

03:48.443 --> 03:52.579
Um, what about...
"Stairway to Heaven"?

03:52.580 --> 03:54.147
Not unless we also build

03:54.148 --> 03:55.916
escalators to heaven
for the disabled students.

03:55.917 --> 03:57.446
Plus, I'm not

03:57.485 --> 03:59.152
really sure if they're even
allowed into heaven.

03:59.153 --> 04:02.039
It's clear that the three of you
are incompetent fools,

04:02.040 --> 04:03.507
possibly some sort
of terrorist cell.

04:03.508 --> 04:06.260
So, as president,
I'm gonna decide

04:06.261 --> 04:08.874
what the prom theme
is going to be this year.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.932
And I think...
that it should be...

04:12.967 --> 04:14.218
"Dinosaurs."

04:14.219 --> 04:15.335
Dinosaurs?!

04:15.336 --> 04:16.837
Yeah.

04:16.838 --> 04:19.273
The Bible told me that dinosaurs
and cavemen lived side by side

04:19.274 --> 04:20.474
for millions of years
in peace,

04:20.475 --> 04:21.608
and I think that's something

04:21.608 --> 04:22.680
that we should
totally celebrate.

04:22.694 --> 04:24.723
No, you can't
be serious.

04:24.779 --> 04:26.725
That's the worst
prom theme ever.

04:26.781 --> 04:30.117
When you insult my dinosaur
prom theme, that's bullying,

04:30.118 --> 04:31.618
and I will not accept it.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.955
By the power vested in me
as president, you are all fired.

04:34.956 --> 04:35.856
Sorry, Rachel,
that includes you.

04:35.857 --> 04:36.990
But I guess

04:36.991 --> 04:39.293
I'll see you in Glee Club, so...

04:39.294 --> 04:40.744
Good meeting, guys.

04:47.168 --> 04:48.664
Good morning,
McKinley High!

04:48.703 --> 04:50.874
First of all, to those of you
thoughtful enough to leave

04:50.889 --> 04:52.626
maternity gifts
outside my office,

04:52.674 --> 04:54.708
both I and my unborn child
thank you

04:54.709 --> 04:56.443
for your lackluster Cracker
Barrel meat-and-cheese medleys,

04:56.444 --> 04:58.173
and I'm sure that

04:58.212 --> 05:00.264
my trash can
will find them delicious.

05:00.265 --> 05:02.302
Now it's time

05:02.317 --> 05:05.889
to announce this year's
Senior Prom Court nominees.

05:05.937 --> 05:08.605
Your choices
for Prom King are...

05:08.606 --> 05:10.018
Rick "The Stick" Nelson.

05:10.057 --> 05:11.391
Yeah!

05:11.392 --> 05:13.277
You know this!

05:13.278 --> 05:15.529
President Brittany S. Pierce.

05:15.530 --> 05:17.498
That's weird.

05:17.499 --> 05:19.653
And also, Finn Hudson.

05:19.701 --> 05:22.903
And now on to the category
we all really care about:

05:22.904 --> 05:24.237
Prom Queen.

05:24.238 --> 05:27.207
Becky for Prom Queen 2012!

05:27.208 --> 05:29.793
Missy Gunderson.

05:32.096 --> 05:34.715
Santana Lopez.

05:36.801 --> 05:38.852
And Quinn Fabray.

05:38.853 --> 05:40.591
Congratulations to
all our nominees...

05:42.357 --> 05:43.640
Becky, Becky, Becky!
That's an antique!

05:43.641 --> 05:45.526
I was robbed, Coach!

05:49.263 --> 05:51.482
So are you bummed you didn't
get nominated for Prom Queen?

05:51.483 --> 05:53.450
In what world would I ever be
nominated for Prom Queen?

05:53.451 --> 05:54.618
Well, I voted for you.

05:54.619 --> 05:55.786
And I got that
crossed-eyed dude

05:55.787 --> 05:57.454
in my study hall
to vote for you, too.

05:57.455 --> 05:59.540
That's very sweet of you, but
I'm not upset at all actually,

05:59.541 --> 06:01.658
because I am gonna be
spending my entire prom night

06:01.659 --> 06:04.661
dancing with my devastatingly
handsome future husband to be.

06:04.662 --> 06:06.079
We'll make your posters
later, okay?

06:06.080 --> 06:07.347
Okay!

06:07.348 --> 06:10.984
A big congrats to all
our prom nominees!

06:13.071 --> 06:14.688
But, hey, listen up.

06:14.689 --> 06:16.039
We are all winners,

06:16.040 --> 06:18.045
because
Principal Figgins

06:18.076 --> 06:20.210
asked New Directions
to sing again this year!

06:20.211 --> 06:21.461
Come on!

06:23.298 --> 06:24.081
Fantastic.

06:24.082 --> 06:25.582
All right.

06:25.583 --> 06:26.800
Brittany has an
announcement.

06:29.203 --> 06:30.921
Hello, my fellow Americans.

06:30.922 --> 06:34.141
The theme for this year's prom
will be...

06:35.476 --> 06:36.510
"Dinosaurs."

06:36.511 --> 06:37.510
Sheer genius.

06:37.512 --> 06:39.149
Thanks.

06:39.213 --> 06:40.901
I was inspired by
the new girl Joe,

06:40.932 --> 06:42.653
who reminds me
of a cavewoman.

06:42.717 --> 06:44.151
The refreshments
will be berries,

06:44.152 --> 06:45.435
meat and rainwater.

06:45.436 --> 06:46.907
As you are no
doubt aware,

06:46.938 --> 06:48.283
the U.S. elections are
riddled with corruption.

06:48.323 --> 06:49.993
Therefore, to keep
the prom elections

06:50.057 --> 06:51.942
completely aboveboard,
I have appointed Santana

06:51.943 --> 06:53.727
and Quinn to count the ballots.

06:53.728 --> 06:55.112
What? That makes no sense!

06:55.113 --> 06:56.563
Shut it, Richard Simmons.

06:56.614 --> 06:57.835
Yes, Quinn's my homegirl,
but I don't trust her,

06:57.899 --> 06:59.566
and you know she doesn't
trust me.

06:59.567 --> 07:00.534
We'll keep each other honest.

07:00.535 --> 07:01.713
You know,

07:01.736 --> 07:02.920
It's actually
not a bad idea.

07:02.921 --> 07:04.204
And last but not least,

07:04.255 --> 07:06.740
all hair gel has been
banned from the prom.

07:06.741 --> 07:08.241
Right.

07:08.242 --> 07:09.596
I'm actually not joking.

07:09.627 --> 07:11.181
Hair gel was not
invented until

07:11.212 --> 07:13.881
almost 30 million years after
the Upper Paleolithic Stone Age.

07:13.882 --> 07:14.948
And frankly,

07:14.949 --> 07:16.082
I don't like the way you look.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.980
Therefore, anyone who

07:18.019 --> 07:19.857
shows up to prom
wearing hair gel will be

07:19.888 --> 07:21.254
turned away
at the door.

07:21.255 --> 07:24.224
I hereby decree this
to be the best prom

07:24.225 --> 07:25.809
Ever.

07:25.810 --> 07:27.694
Okay.

07:27.695 --> 07:30.931
Let's start thinking
of... dinosaur songs.

07:45.964 --> 07:47.384
Hey, did you
know about this?

07:47.415 --> 07:49.049
I know you knew about
this 'cause it was hung

07:49.050 --> 07:50.637
at eye level and I know
Quinn couldn't reach up

07:50.718 --> 07:51.952
that high to put it there.
Whoa, whoa.

07:51.953 --> 07:53.453
Remember when I told you
that if you come at me

07:53.454 --> 07:55.305
with the crazy right off the bat
that my head goes all empty

07:55.306 --> 07:56.673
and I can't really have
a productive conversation?

07:56.674 --> 07:58.124
This isn't crazy,
this is mad, this is hurt.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.726
This isn't a big deal.
Not a big deal?

07:59.727 --> 08:02.128
I'm gonna have to watch my
fiancé dance in front of

08:02.129 --> 08:04.598
the entire school with his
ex-girlfriend at my senior prom.

08:04.599 --> 08:07.067
If you haven't noticed,
Quinn can't dance.

08:07.068 --> 08:09.152
She just about died
coming to our wedding.

08:09.153 --> 08:10.971
She asked me if I would
campaign with her,

08:10.972 --> 08:13.607
and I figured it was the least
I could do for our friend.

08:13.608 --> 08:15.025
I can't believe
how selfish you're being.

08:15.026 --> 08:16.243
Yeah, well,
if you haven't noticed,

08:16.244 --> 08:17.361
I'm kind of having
a bad week myself.

08:19.247 --> 08:21.615
I can't believe that my entire
high school career is gonna end

08:21.616 --> 08:24.284
the exact same way it started...
just some sad little Jewish girl

08:24.285 --> 08:25.702
watching you get
all the attention

08:25.703 --> 08:27.424
with the pretty blonde cheerleader.
Oh...

08:33.347 --> 08:34.429
Come on.

08:38.673 --> 08:39.941
Good, good, good.
Come on.

08:39.942 --> 08:42.009
All right, now let go
of your hands.

08:42.010 --> 08:43.311
You got this.
Just-just let go.

08:43.312 --> 08:44.483
I promise you'll be okay.

08:46.315 --> 08:48.182
You got it.

08:48.233 --> 08:49.850
Good.

08:49.851 --> 08:50.985
Come on.

08:51.036 --> 08:53.287
This is all you.
Look at you.

08:53.288 --> 08:54.489
You have it.
Just-just...

08:54.540 --> 08:55.656
No-no-no-no-no!

08:55.657 --> 08:56.958
Are you okay?

08:56.959 --> 08:58.526
Yeah, I'm okay.
I knew you could do it.

08:58.577 --> 08:59.494
That was fantastic.

08:59.545 --> 09:00.628
You're amazing.

09:00.629 --> 09:03.915
Thank you for always
coming with me.

09:03.916 --> 09:05.199
Totally selfish.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.588
I get to hang with you.

09:08.003 --> 09:09.504
Take a break, then
let's show everyone.

09:09.505 --> 09:10.504
Glee and...

09:10.506 --> 09:11.839
No, no.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.141
Why? This is huge.

09:13.142 --> 09:15.143
Because it has to be real.

09:15.144 --> 09:18.096
I mean...

09:18.097 --> 09:19.847
you know, maybe if
I practiced a lot,

09:19.848 --> 09:21.770
I could walk
into the choir room.

09:21.850 --> 09:23.351
Or even prom.

09:23.402 --> 09:24.685
So until then,

09:24.736 --> 09:28.322
just promise me
you won't tell anybody.

09:28.323 --> 09:30.525
You're gonna be
dancing at prom.

09:30.526 --> 09:31.571
I know it.

09:35.364 --> 09:38.032
<i>I, Becky Faye Jackson,</i>

09:38.033 --> 09:42.837
<i>was born to be Queen,
but my crown has been stolen.</i>

09:42.838 --> 09:45.756
<i>Queens don't always have to
look the same, you know.</i>

09:45.757 --> 09:47.758
<i>Sometimes they look different.</i>

09:47.759 --> 09:50.244
<i>Sometimes they're shorter.</i>

09:50.245 --> 09:51.429
<i>Or wear glasses.</i>

09:54.177 --> 09:57.685
<i>What are you smiling about,
poster-people?</i>

09:57.686 --> 09:59.887
<i>And stop staring at me!</i>

09:59.888 --> 10:03.724
<i>It's not fun to be stared at.</i>

10:04.977 --> 10:08.029
Becky, I understand
you're upset,

10:08.030 --> 10:11.115
but this scorched earth reign
of terror must come to an end.

10:11.116 --> 10:13.530
First, you declared
war on xylophones.

10:16.822 --> 10:19.207
Then, you ransacked
the cafeteria line.

10:24.913 --> 10:27.281
But, Coach,
I want to be Prom Queen,

10:27.282 --> 10:29.250
just like I just saw
in that commercial.

10:29.251 --> 10:31.619
Oh, Becky, commercials
aren't real life.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.504
Advertisers are
manipulative alcoholics

10:33.505 --> 10:35.590
who use images to
play on our emotions.

10:35.591 --> 10:36.757
Haven't you
seen <i>Mad Men?</i>

10:36.808 --> 10:38.125
No.

10:38.126 --> 10:39.260
Neither have I.

10:39.261 --> 10:41.629
Becky, let's
be realistic:

10:41.630 --> 10:43.981
You just didn't have the votes.

10:43.982 --> 10:47.518
For starters, your posters
sent a bit of a mixed message.

10:47.519 --> 10:50.605
But my paintbrush doesn't
have spell check, Coach.

10:50.606 --> 10:54.141
And second... and I mean this
as a compliment...

10:54.142 --> 10:55.493
you're a bitch, Becky.

10:56.778 --> 10:57.945
With a bad attitude.

10:57.996 --> 10:59.263
And honestly,

10:59.264 --> 11:00.164
with Quinn Fabray
in a wheelchair,

11:00.165 --> 11:01.282
the sympathy vote was split.

11:01.283 --> 11:02.867
But here's the
goods.

11:02.951 --> 11:05.086
You're coming to prom with me,
Becky Jackson,

11:05.087 --> 11:06.987
where I'm making you
deputy in charge

11:07.039 --> 11:08.623
of guarding the
punch bowl.

11:08.674 --> 11:10.041
Chin up, Jackson.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.210
And please be
careful walking

11:12.211 --> 11:13.844
past my brand-new
xylophone.

11:15.214 --> 11:16.631
That's the attitude
right there, Becky.

Rehearsing for prom?

13:32.534 --> 13:34.368
'Cause I love that song,

13:34.369 --> 13:36.253
but it's sort of a downer,
don't you think?

13:36.254 --> 13:38.089
It's just how I'm feeling
right now, okay?

13:38.173 --> 13:39.924
I don't want to watch
Finn and Quinn

13:39.925 --> 13:41.726
get crowned the king
and queen at my prom.

13:41.810 --> 13:44.929
I don't want to watch him
dance with her.

13:44.930 --> 13:45.825
I-I know that
she can't

13:45.880 --> 13:47.214
really dance anymore, but...

13:47.215 --> 13:49.266
I'm sorry. You know...
you know what I mean.

13:49.351 --> 13:50.685
She's right.

13:50.686 --> 13:52.052
Prom sucks.
Yeah.

13:52.053 --> 13:53.875
I don't want to go, either.
Well, you have to go.

13:53.905 --> 13:55.055
You're the reigning prom queen.

13:55.056 --> 13:56.323
You have to crown the next one.

13:56.324 --> 13:58.025
As much as I love
a good coronation,

13:58.076 --> 13:59.193
I can't risk it.

13:59.244 --> 14:00.361
With this school's

14:00.412 --> 14:01.612
strong and
insane tradition

14:01.613 --> 14:03.114
of write-in ballots,
I could get

14:03.115 --> 14:05.095
elected prom queen
again, all right?

14:05.117 --> 14:06.450
And I know I put on

14:06.451 --> 14:08.869
a brave face last year,
but it was humiliating.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.955
And, had I known, I would have
worn a full kilt, so...

14:11.039 --> 14:12.173
How do you
think I feel

14:12.174 --> 14:13.907
with Brittany's
insane ban on hair gel?

14:13.959 --> 14:16.343
It's prom. There's going to be
balloons all over the place,

14:16.411 --> 14:19.046
not to mention the taffeta
and the silk blends.

14:19.047 --> 14:20.464
The sheer amount
of static electricity

14:20.465 --> 14:22.433
in that room
is going to be terrifying.

14:22.434 --> 14:24.552
It's crazy.
You've never seen my hair

14:24.553 --> 14:26.554
without gel...
it's-it's baby-hair fine.

14:26.605 --> 14:28.472
No, it... I'm going
to look like Medusa.

14:28.473 --> 14:30.274
It's not funny.
I don't want to go.

14:30.275 --> 14:32.026
Well, if we're
all going to be

14:32.027 --> 14:34.695
so miserable about it,
who says we have to go?

14:34.763 --> 14:36.280
You're right, Kurt.

14:36.281 --> 14:37.982
But I have a better idea.

14:37.983 --> 14:39.713
So Kurt and Blaine
and I are throwing

14:39.768 --> 14:40.701
an anti-prom party.

14:40.769 --> 14:42.486
What's an anti-prom party?

14:42.487 --> 14:43.988
It's a party
for those of us

14:43.989 --> 14:45.489
who maybe feel a
little, you know,

14:45.490 --> 14:46.940
disenfranchised by
the actual prom.

14:46.992 --> 14:49.160
And I got us a hotel room
at Lima's best hotel,

14:49.244 --> 14:51.599
Red Rooster Express Suite,
and everyone's invited.

14:51.630 --> 14:52.663
You're supporting this?

14:52.748 --> 14:53.914
I'm supporting her,

14:53.915 --> 14:55.132
and I'll be there

14:55.133 --> 14:57.084
as soon as I'm done
fulfilling my...

14:57.135 --> 14:58.836
obligations.

14:58.837 --> 15:00.337
The mood
will be celebratory,

15:00.338 --> 15:01.889
the food will
be catered,

15:01.890 --> 15:03.424
the libations
will be plentiful,

15:03.425 --> 15:05.843
and the dress code
will be creative black tie.

15:05.844 --> 15:07.478
Optional,
optional, optional.

15:07.562 --> 15:09.563
And keeping up with
the anti-prom theme,

15:09.564 --> 15:10.931
everyone is welcome,
and unlike the actual prom,

15:10.932 --> 15:12.266
which ends at 11:00 p.m.,

15:12.267 --> 15:13.901
ours goes until the wee hours
of the night.

15:13.902 --> 15:15.186
It's where the fun's at,
you guys.

15:15.187 --> 15:16.804
Okay, how is everyone welcome
when this is clearly

15:16.855 --> 15:19.406
just a party for you and
the two gay Winklevii twins?

15:19.474 --> 15:20.991
Actually,
Santana, we've invited

15:20.992 --> 15:22.743
most of McKinley's
underclassmen.

15:22.811 --> 15:25.112
I wanted to invite you
to our anti-prom party.

15:25.113 --> 15:26.697
Who's going?
Me, Kurt...

15:26.698 --> 15:28.115
Boring. Who else?

15:28.116 --> 15:29.784
Well, we just came up
with the idea.

15:29.785 --> 15:31.252
I'll think about it.

15:32.871 --> 15:34.538
- I'm in.
- But what about

15:34.539 --> 15:35.840
your tradition of trying

15:35.841 --> 15:36.990
to spike Coach Sylvester's
punch bowl?

15:37.042 --> 15:38.158
I almost lost
my teeth

15:38.159 --> 15:40.377
for it last time.
It's impossible.

15:40.378 --> 15:43.097
Plus it's a bummer,
always failing... at everything.

15:43.098 --> 15:45.099
Can we just talk
about what this really is?

15:45.100 --> 15:46.433
Rachel Berry
isn't getting her way,

15:46.434 --> 15:48.001
so she's punishing
the rest of us.

15:48.002 --> 15:49.403
Santana, that's not
the case at all.

15:49.471 --> 15:50.671
Stop acting like you're fine

15:50.672 --> 15:52.439
and start dealing
with your crap.

15:52.507 --> 15:54.329
Look, you choked
at your big audition.

15:54.376 --> 15:55.342
I get it.

15:55.393 --> 15:57.444
I'm sorry, but it happens.

15:57.445 --> 15:59.680
And I understand that you're
pissed off at the universe,

15:59.731 --> 16:01.232
but imploding on one
of the last nights

16:01.233 --> 16:02.700
that we have
to spend together

16:02.701 --> 16:04.902
because, basically, you're just
not in the mood to dance

16:04.903 --> 16:06.854
is maybe the pettiest thing
you have ever done.

16:06.905 --> 16:09.189
So have fun at your
"I'm a victim" party,

16:09.190 --> 16:11.596
acting like you're not
some selfish, self-centered,

16:11.660 --> 16:13.494
lame-ass wannabe diva from hell,

16:13.495 --> 16:16.363
because me, I'm going to go
to my senior prom

16:16.364 --> 16:18.198
with my girlfriend
and my friends.

16:22.921 --> 16:24.922
You can't be too pleased
by that stunt Rachel's pulling.

16:24.923 --> 16:26.874
I'm not, but I kind of
feel bad for her.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.375
She's going through a
lot of rough stuff.

16:28.376 --> 16:29.543
Rough stuff?

16:29.544 --> 16:30.811
Did you forget that
you're talking

16:30.812 --> 16:32.713
to a girl in
a wheelchair?

16:34.549 --> 16:36.851
Yeah, looks good.

16:36.852 --> 16:38.102
We've come
full circle.

16:38.103 --> 16:39.820
Yeah, just like old times.

16:39.821 --> 16:41.856
Though, to be clear,
there will be no

16:41.907 --> 16:43.407
extracurricular
activity this time.

16:43.491 --> 16:45.776
I'm going to Yale, and there
are no tire store majors there.

16:45.861 --> 16:48.195
Well, neither are there
at the Actors Studio,

16:48.196 --> 16:49.563
where I'm applying.

16:49.614 --> 16:51.594
Oh, my God.

16:52.951 --> 16:54.568
Quinn Fabray...

16:54.569 --> 16:56.891
you're so brave
to be doing this.

16:56.922 --> 16:58.572
Thank you.

16:58.573 --> 17:01.074
The atrophy in my leg
is a constant reminder

17:01.075 --> 17:04.127
of the slow, withering remnants
of my past life.

17:04.128 --> 17:06.130
The toll can, at
times, be physically

17:06.214 --> 17:07.464
and emotionally hard,

17:07.464 --> 17:08.933
knowing that I may
never walk again.

17:09.017 --> 17:11.935
People like you
inspire me.

17:11.936 --> 17:14.939
Your healthy, normal
legs are beautiful.

17:17.058 --> 17:19.059
You deserve this.

17:21.396 --> 17:23.280
You've got my vote.

17:26.952 --> 17:30.550
Wow, that was super creepy.

17:30.605 --> 17:32.406
It won't be when we're standing

17:32.407 --> 17:34.875
up on that stage
soaking up the applause.

17:34.876 --> 17:36.944
Don't you feel kind of weird
using your injury

17:36.945 --> 17:38.349
to get the sympathy vote
like that?

17:38.413 --> 17:41.081
Votes are votes, Finn.

17:41.082 --> 17:43.450
Do you want to win or not?

17:54.624 --> 17:57.176
This is awesome.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.729
I actually really
love dinosaurs.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.041
Whoa.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.650
Triceratops.

19:47.955 --> 19:49.956
I-I want to make
sure that I can, uh,

19:49.957 --> 19:52.258
get her and her wheelchair
up on stage when she wins.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.627
Well, she had a couple
of cups of punch earlier,

19:54.628 --> 19:56.712
so I'd probably start
with the little girls' room.

20:21.938 --> 20:23.739
You... you can walk?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.408
Yeah.

20:25.409 --> 20:26.876
Isn't it amazing?

20:29.937 --> 20:32.448
You're seeing me
take my first steps.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.083
So you-you... you lied to us.

20:34.084 --> 20:35.418
To everybody.

20:35.419 --> 20:37.753
No, I mean, my legs
are getting better,

20:37.754 --> 20:40.089
but I wanted it
to be a surprise.

20:40.140 --> 20:42.458
You know, for when
I walk up there

20:42.509 --> 20:45.144
and... and get my crown.

20:45.145 --> 20:47.629
The crowd will go wild.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.966
I really want this.
Yeah.

20:51.018 --> 20:52.818
You may want this,

20:52.819 --> 20:54.854
but Rachel needs me,
and... and I picked

20:54.938 --> 20:56.155
you over her.

20:56.156 --> 20:58.074
Do you know how stupid
that makes me feel?

20:58.075 --> 20:59.358
You have everything.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.809
You're going to have your crown.

21:00.810 --> 21:02.078
You're going
to go to Yale.

21:02.079 --> 21:03.079
Rachel has
none of that.

21:03.146 --> 21:04.747
And tonight, thanks to you,

21:04.748 --> 21:06.615
she doesn't even have me.
We're a shoo-in.

21:06.616 --> 21:08.367
I need you.

21:08.452 --> 21:09.869
No, you don't need me, okay?

21:09.870 --> 21:11.203
I-I-I thought

21:11.288 --> 21:12.872
going through all
that terrible stuff

21:12.956 --> 21:14.256
this year made you cooler,

21:14.257 --> 21:15.991
but no, you're still
the same old Quinn.

21:15.992 --> 21:17.826
All that matters is you.
Come on, stop!

21:17.827 --> 21:19.161
Please.

21:21.321 --> 21:23.766
Look, it's mandatory
for the nominees

21:23.767 --> 21:25.634
to have at least one
dance together.

21:28.138 --> 21:30.139
I know you don't understand

21:30.140 --> 21:31.941
how much this means
to me, but...

21:34.978 --> 21:37.846
... will you please
just stay here for me?

21:37.847 --> 21:39.515
Please.

21:44.020 --> 21:45.654
Oh, my God.
All right.

21:45.655 --> 21:48.624
Let the very first annual
McKinley High Anti-Prom begin.

21:51.694 --> 21:53.662
Oh, look, there's
chocolates on the pillows.

21:53.663 --> 21:55.164
We got room service.

21:55.165 --> 21:56.607
Minibar! Whoo!

21:56.666 --> 21:58.217
Nice!

21:58.218 --> 22:00.419
So, uh, what
should we do now?

22:00.504 --> 22:02.871
Duh... play strip poker.

22:02.872 --> 22:04.306
I brought condoms.

22:06.510 --> 22:09.111
Becky, Blaine and I
are gay, remember?

22:09.179 --> 22:10.563
Never stopped me before.

22:12.182 --> 22:15.484
Well, I mean, no matter what,
it'll be better than prom.

22:15.485 --> 22:19.155
Yeah! Who wants to be in
that smelly old gym, anyway?

22:19.156 --> 22:20.439
Prom's a sucker's
paradise.

22:20.524 --> 22:24.110
Prom sucks!
Let's get wasted! Whoo!

22:24.111 --> 22:26.695
Becky, Becky, we appreciate
your enthusiasm,

22:26.696 --> 22:29.448
but will you just keep it down
with the shouting?

22:29.449 --> 22:32.734
Keep your big honking nose out
of it, Berry!

22:32.735 --> 22:33.811
Oh, snap! Oh snap!

22:33.870 --> 22:35.538
So, I wouldn't mind

22:35.589 --> 22:36.731
watching a little TV.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.257
Um, maybe some Bravo?

22:38.258 --> 22:39.776
Dude, it's a hotel.
It's gotta be Skinemax.

22:39.843 --> 22:42.678
We could put on a fashion show!

22:42.679 --> 22:44.713
Yeah! Let's go all
<i>Sound of Music</i>

22:44.714 --> 22:46.215
and make some old-timey couture

22:46.216 --> 22:47.850
out of the drapes and bedsheets, huh?
Too gay!

22:47.917 --> 22:48.868
I second that.

22:48.918 --> 22:50.119
Well, I'd love

22:50.187 --> 22:52.138
to show you guys my prom dress.

22:52.139 --> 22:54.140
I wouldn't want it
to go completely to waste.

22:54.141 --> 22:55.975
It's in my car.

24:51.725 --> 24:53.475

25:04.104 --> 25:06.272

You must have

25:06.273 --> 25:07.723
with all that physical therapy
you've been giving.

25:07.724 --> 25:09.108
Hey, just finish the dance

25:13.580 --> 25:16.532

25:17.751 --> 25:19.785
Not this time, Coach.

25:19.869 --> 25:21.870
Good idea, Frumps.

25:21.871 --> 25:24.573
What are you looking at,
Jar-Jar Binks?

25:29.956 --> 25:33.959
Touch those peanut M&M's,

25:33.960 --> 25:35.927
This is a repeat.
It's the one with

25:35.928 --> 25:39.498
the passive-aggressive lesbian
and the doggy care.

25:39.499 --> 25:42.250

If you wanted to go
to the prom,

25:47.723 --> 25:49.091
I would have gone
with you.

25:49.092 --> 25:50.792
I am not going

25:50.843 --> 25:53.979
to give into Brittany's
insane ban on hair gel.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.397
Freedom to use hair care
products?

25:55.464 --> 25:57.099
It's in the Bill of Rights.

25:57.100 --> 25:59.017
Didn't the founding
fathers all wear wigs?

25:59.102 --> 26:00.569
You haven't seen me

26:00.570 --> 26:02.671
without an enormous amount
of gel in my hair.

26:02.672 --> 26:04.940
It's, it's really bad.

26:05.775 --> 26:07.242
Finally,

26:07.243 --> 26:10.662
the room service is here.
I want my shrimp cocktail!

26:12.832 --> 26:15.324
Hey, Becky.

26:15.368 --> 26:16.985

26:16.986 --> 26:19.788
She's been in the bathroom
for 45 minutes.

26:19.789 --> 26:21.840
I'm guessing the runs.

26:21.908 --> 26:23.291
All right, let's let

26:23.292 --> 26:26.128
the anti-prom fashion
extravaganza begin.

26:26.179 --> 26:27.253
Hi.

26:28.998 --> 26:30.599
What are you doing here?

26:30.666 --> 26:32.884
Well, I'll keep it simple.

26:32.885 --> 26:35.437
I love you. You're beautiful.

26:35.438 --> 26:36.721

26:48.151 --> 26:50.651
Prom sucks without
all of you, guys.

26:50.703 --> 26:52.020

26:52.021 --> 26:54.239
we're gonna get to be together
like this.

26:54.240 --> 26:57.358
I want to dance with my
fiancé, dance with my friends.

26:59.562 --> 27:01.830
Well, I'll just pretend
to be an iceculpture

27:01.831 --> 27:04.365
if Brittany sees me,
and then she'll just pass me by.

27:05.201 --> 27:06.885
So, you guys gonna come?

27:06.969 --> 27:08.720
Not until I get
my shrimp cocktail.

27:08.721 --> 27:10.755
I'm good.
And you guys go ahead.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.506
Come on, dude.
You're my wingman.

27:12.558 --> 27:14.976
I'll go next year.

27:15.044 --> 27:16.928

27:25.154 --> 27:27.656

Puckerman?

27:28.691 --> 27:31.610

30:11.420 --> 30:14.089
Crap.
I'm getting sharked.

30:14.090 --> 30:15.272
Where'd you learn to play?

30:15.324 --> 30:17.175
In the joint.

30:17.176 --> 30:20.095
Well, I'm one losing
hand away

30:20.096 --> 30:21.713
from an extremely
awkward situation,

30:21.714 --> 30:23.882
so would you mind laying
off a little bit?

30:23.883 --> 30:27.668
I can't. I'm too pissed off.
Why?

30:27.669 --> 30:30.855
'Cause I didn't get nominated
for prom queen

30:30.940 --> 30:33.174
like that girl in
the commercial.

30:33.175 --> 30:36.061
Coach Sue said
I couldn't get the votes.

30:36.062 --> 30:37.295
You really wanted that crown,
huh?

30:37.363 --> 30:40.115
More than anything.

30:40.116 --> 30:42.083
It hurts, Puck.

30:42.151 --> 30:44.702
Becky Jackson...

30:44.703 --> 30:46.955
I'm putting some clothes on
'cause I have an idea.

30:47.022 --> 30:48.356
Really?

30:48.407 --> 30:50.691
Yeah, check it out.

30:50.743 --> 30:52.293
We still haven't crowned a king

30:52.294 --> 30:54.129
and queen for
the anti-prom, have we?

30:54.130 --> 30:55.330
No, we haven't.

30:55.381 --> 30:57.215
I'm gonna bust out my knife.

30:58.501 --> 31:00.051
If you ask me, I think

31:00.136 --> 31:03.153
the anti-prom's
the most important prom of all.

31:06.708 --> 31:10.378
First, we need a king.

31:10.429 --> 31:11.729
Nice.

31:11.814 --> 31:15.433
And then now,
we need a queen. Hmm...

31:15.518 --> 31:17.936
I hope I get it.

31:18.020 --> 31:20.105
Becky Jackson...

31:20.106 --> 31:24.075
I crown you the Queen
of the anti-prom.

31:24.160 --> 31:26.361
Take a look.

31:28.781 --> 31:30.999
Oh, my gosh!

31:31.000 --> 31:34.619
I did it.

31:34.620 --> 31:36.588
I'm so happy.

31:36.589 --> 31:39.207
Your Highness,
what do you say we get out of here?

31:39.208 --> 31:40.607
Sure.

31:41.851 --> 31:43.294
My prince.

31:47.622 --> 31:48.989
Hey, I got your text.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.124
You have three
minutes.

31:50.125 --> 31:51.942
The voting has started,
and I need

31:51.943 --> 31:53.829
to get out there
and press the flesh.

31:53.878 --> 31:55.329
Look, I owe you
an apology.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.331
I-I found out
that you and Finn

31:57.332 --> 31:58.465
were campaigning
together,

31:58.466 --> 31:59.967
and I kind of
freaked out.

31:59.968 --> 32:02.086
I got really jealous
and irrational,

32:02.087 --> 32:03.787
I just, I should have
been supportive.

32:03.838 --> 32:05.923
Well, since I had no idea
that was going on,

32:05.924 --> 32:07.591
it's pretty easy
to forgive you.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.309
So I'm glad we cleared
this up.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.796
Wait.
Do you not understand

32:12.797 --> 32:14.181
what you mean to me?

32:14.182 --> 32:15.809
When we first met,

32:15.817 --> 32:17.985
you were everything
I wanted to be:

32:17.986 --> 32:19.970
You were beautiful
and popular,

32:19.971 --> 32:20.970
and you had Finn.

32:20.972 --> 32:23.607
How the mighty have fallen.

32:23.608 --> 32:24.742
No, you don't understand.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.276
I still see you
the same way, okay?

32:26.277 --> 32:29.847
That's why I got so crazy.

32:29.848 --> 32:32.149
Because I wasn't seeing
the new Quinn.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.784
The still-beautiful,

32:33.785 --> 32:36.372
but humbled
and inspiring Quinn.

32:36.421 --> 32:40.793
I, I've lost so much
over these past few weeks.

32:40.825 --> 32:42.126
And I honestly
don't know

32:42.127 --> 32:44.461
what the hell I'm gonna do
to do with my life.

32:44.512 --> 32:46.597
But when I look back
on my high school career

32:46.598 --> 32:48.682
the one thing, the one
accomplishment that I'm gonna be

32:48.683 --> 32:51.018
so proud of is that I found
a way to be your friend.

32:52.520 --> 32:55.222
So I'm apologizing
to my friend.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.174
And I also want you
to know that

32:57.175 --> 32:58.776
I voted for you
for Prom Queen.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.811
And I really think you
deserve it.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.780
Stop making out
with Berry and

33:02.781 --> 33:04.148
get to the
Spanish room, Quinn.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.316
It's time to count the votes
and declare me the winner.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.651
Right.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.519
Bye. Good luck.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.162
Drop that ladle,
Cohen-Chang!

33:18.163 --> 33:19.529
Ooh, I'm onto you, lady.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.865
You're trying to
spike my punch!

33:21.866 --> 33:23.333
No, I'm not.
I'm just thirsty.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.585
I'm dehydrated from
all the crying.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.170
Yeah, right.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.338
That dress is hideous.

33:33.812 --> 33:39.399
<i>Becky Faye Jackson,
you've done it!</i>

33:39.400 --> 33:43.654
<i>You're at senior prom with
a crown on your head,</i>

33:43.655 --> 33:46.857
<i>and a hot piece of booty
on your arm.</i>

33:46.858 --> 33:48.575
<i>And for once in my life,</i>

33:48.576 --> 33:52.079
<i>I don't mind everybody
staring at me.</i>

33:55.233 --> 33:57.367
Game on, beautiful.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.702
Born for this, Puckerman.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.740
Becky, I don't care which dope
we crown here tonight,

34:03.741 --> 34:06.260
you are truly the queen
of this joint.

34:06.261 --> 34:08.245
Thanks, Coach!

34:08.246 --> 34:09.630
Oh, my God!

34:09.681 --> 34:11.181
Is that a sniper
in the rafters?

34:11.248 --> 34:13.510
Oh, I knew I should've
done another security sweep.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.851
I don't see anything.

34:14.918 --> 34:17.221
Use your infrared
glasses, Coach.

34:17.222 --> 34:18.522
Good idea, Becky.

34:21.759 --> 34:22.976
I don't see anything.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.766
Dance with me, Puckerman?

34:29.817 --> 34:32.703
Thank you for making my dream
come true, my queen.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.661
My count for king
is the same as yours.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.295
I don't get it.

34:42.297 --> 34:44.214
How could Brittany have only
gotten four votes?

34:44.215 --> 34:45.882
This Dino Prom theme
was a smash.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.284
Well, maybe it has something
to do with the fact

34:48.286 --> 34:49.636
that she's a girl.

34:49.637 --> 34:51.304
Well, screw this.

34:51.306 --> 34:54.591
I don't want to be queen
if Britt isn't king.

34:54.592 --> 34:59.629
Well, good, because my count for
queen was the same as yours.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.098
I won by one vote.

35:06.621 --> 35:09.239
I won.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.858
It's everything I've ever wanted

35:11.859 --> 35:15.629
and I don't feel any different.

35:15.630 --> 35:17.848
Cool.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.100
I mean, I guess
you deserve to win, right?

35:20.101 --> 35:23.637
What with being a crip and all.

35:23.638 --> 35:26.807
You know, we really have had
the dream high school careers.

35:28.226 --> 35:31.695
Mega-popular,
doing whatever we wanted.

35:31.696 --> 35:33.530
Whoever we wanted.

35:33.598 --> 35:35.098
You know, I'm really
not surprised

35:35.099 --> 35:37.427
that you and I were
the top two candidates.

35:37.435 --> 35:39.119
Yeah.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.848
Well, you know, it would be
boring if we weren't so awesome.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.608
Don't you want to leave this
place having made a difference?

36:01.295 --> 36:02.763
Oh, my dear God.

36:02.814 --> 36:04.731
Don't make fun of
the new kid

36:04.799 --> 36:06.817
with the bad 'fro.
It's hair-bullying.

36:06.818 --> 36:09.126
That's not a new kid.
That's Blaine without hair gel.

36:09.154 --> 36:11.137
Is it really
that bad?

36:11.138 --> 36:13.106
Yeah, you're Mr. Broccoli Head.
It's not that bad.

36:13.107 --> 36:14.274
Yeah, it is.
It's really bad.

36:14.275 --> 36:16.216
And you made your point.

36:16.244 --> 36:18.195
I abuse my power as president...
but to help save the prom,

36:18.196 --> 36:20.596
and to keep people from turning
to stone when they look at you,

36:20.615 --> 36:23.450
I'll give you special permission
to wear hair gel, immediately.

36:24.619 --> 36:25.953
Quiet, please, children.

36:25.954 --> 36:28.655
I'll be right back.

36:28.706 --> 36:29.623
Thank you, thank you.

36:29.624 --> 36:31.291
Don't you dare.

36:31.292 --> 36:33.126
I love finally getting
to see the real you.

36:33.127 --> 36:34.511
The man without
the product.

36:34.512 --> 36:37.347
And I want everyone here to
know just how proud I am

36:37.348 --> 36:40.350
of my brave, handsome,
bushy-haired boyfriend.

36:40.351 --> 36:42.019
Come on, Barrette.

36:43.304 --> 36:45.522
First I have
an announcement to make:

36:45.590 --> 36:48.392
There are reptiles living in
McKinley toilets no more.

36:48.476 --> 36:52.479
The family of snakes has been
safely removed to the zoo,

36:52.480 --> 36:55.032
and they can life out their
lives in the toilets there.

36:57.485 --> 37:00.237
And now, this year's Prom Court:

37:05.743 --> 37:09.195
Nominees for
the Prom King are:

37:09.196 --> 37:11.146
Finn Hudson...

37:13.551 --> 37:16.985
Rick "The Stick" Nelson...

37:21.375 --> 37:23.427
I love you, man!

37:23.428 --> 37:26.328
And President
Brittany S. Pierce.

37:31.269 --> 37:33.904
The nominees
for Prom Queen:

37:33.905 --> 37:37.506
Missy Gunderson...

37:40.495 --> 37:42.678
Santana Lopez...

37:42.697 --> 37:46.283
(applause, whoopin

37:46.284 --> 37:49.786
... and Miss Quinn Fabray.

37:53.174 --> 37:54.708
I would like to invite
last year's queen,

37:54.709 --> 37:57.294
sassy male student Kurt Hummel,

37:57.295 --> 37:59.596
to crown this year's winners.

38:09.557 --> 38:11.775
And...

38:11.776 --> 38:15.612
this year's Prom King is...

38:20.101 --> 38:21.952
Hmm...

38:24.572 --> 38:25.822
Mr. Finn Hudson.

38:30.578 --> 38:31.628
Go, Finn!

38:44.392 --> 38:48.478
And the winner
for Prom Queen is...

38:54.402 --> 38:58.639
Students, for the second year
in a row, we have prom anarchy.

38:58.706 --> 39:02.257
Receiving the majority of
write-in votes,

39:02.309 --> 39:04.978
I would like to welcome
on the stage...

39:08.700 --> 39:11.251
Miss Rachel Berry.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.520
Smile and breathe.

39:50.992 --> 39:54.711
McKinley Titans,
bow down to your new leaders!

40:00.885 --> 40:02.368
And now...
