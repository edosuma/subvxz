- Hello.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.166
Hello?

00:32.583 --> 00:35.667
Patrick?
Hello, Patrick, is that you?

00:36.500 --> 00:37.709
Nicholas?

00:37.792 --> 00:41.500
Patrick, I'm afraid
I have rather bad news.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.834
I'm in New York.

00:43.917 --> 00:45.834
It concerns your father.

Ah, Yvette!

03:26.000 --> 03:27.583
It's you! Bonjour.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.166
Monsieur Melrose.
I am making the table ready

03:30.250 --> 03:33.000
- for this evening.
- Ah, yes.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.917
A beautiful day.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.333
I sense autumn...

03:43.083 --> 03:44.709
..don't you?
Je sens l'automne.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.667
- Oui, Monsieur Melrose.

03:47.750 --> 03:52.083
Has she risen, like the sun,
to cast her golden rays on us?

03:52.166 --> 03:55.083
Not yet, Monsieur Melrose.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.875
And my son. I hoped
to spend the day with him.

04:01.959 --> 04:03.959
- He's playing, monsieur.

04:06.709 --> 04:10.625
Everyone seems to be
hiding from me this morning.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.083
Well...

04:37.166 --> 04:39.709
You be careful
with my wife's china,

04:39.792 --> 04:41.875
it's extremely valuable.

♪♪

05:27.417 --> 05:30.250
Oh! Oh, Christ, that hurts.

God! Hm!

06:24.041 --> 06:24.500
Eleanor?

06:26.875 --> 06:28.083
Patrick?

06:28.166 --> 06:29.583
Where's everyone hiding?

06:50.917 --> 06:52.792
Hm...

07:15.458 --> 07:16.917
Anne!

07:17.000 --> 07:19.458
Are you up yet? Aha-ha.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.208
So. Who are you on?

07:27.291 --> 07:30.709
Caligula, appropriately enough.

07:32.917 --> 07:34.291
Well, come on.
Breakfast now.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.333
Oh, darling, you shouldn't have.

07:36.417 --> 07:39.375
- Made breakfast.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.333
No, I mean...I'm... I'm...

07:41.417 --> 07:44.875
I mean, I'm...
ready for breakfast.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.875
You know it's a real turn-on,
you reaching for the clock
like that.

08:02.959 --> 08:06.083
- You might help out here.

08:06.166 --> 08:08.458
- Move around a little.
- If we miss our flight...

08:09.417 --> 08:12.750
Oh, God,
what's the bloody point?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.583
Ruined beauty.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.583
It won't be long
before they say...

08:31.291 --> 08:33.250
"He used to be so handsome."

08:33.333 --> 08:35.583
- Oh, you still are.

08:35.667 --> 08:38.083
Give over, luv, give over.

08:38.166 --> 08:40.041
Eurgh! Don't do that, though.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.250
- Oh, Christ, there's the taxi.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.083
Where are we going this time?

08:44.166 --> 08:44.959
I told you.
The South of France!

08:45.041 --> 08:47.417
Mm...

08:47.500 --> 08:49.333
I just think it's a little rude.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.750
We are his guests, after all.

08:51.834 --> 08:55.959
Well, I'm sorry,
I'd no idea there'd be a test.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.375
Well, with David Melrose
there's always a test.

09:00.041 --> 09:01.917
It's a good idea to...

09:02.000 --> 09:05.875
Well, to prepare
something intelligent to say.

09:05.959 --> 09:07.875
Well, did you know
Caligula tortured his wife

09:07.959 --> 09:11.542
to find out why
he was so devoted to her?

09:11.625 --> 09:13.709
What's David's excuse, I wonder?

09:13.792 --> 09:17.625
And what's in this for you,
Sir Victor?

09:17.709 --> 09:19.375
If you're so scared of him,
why are we even here?

09:19.458 --> 09:20.709
I'm not scared of him.

09:20.792 --> 09:24.041
I'm just fascinated by him,
that's all.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.542
At Eton he was an
extraordinarily gifted

09:25.625 --> 09:28.125
young man,
very distinguished.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.834
- Held in awe.
- When I was at college,

09:29.917 --> 09:32.583
the football heroes got to sleep
with the cheerleaders.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.875
At Eton, they got to beat young
boys for burning the toast.

09:35.959 --> 09:39.333
He didn't beat me exactly.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.417
The important thing is
we're friends now,

09:41.500 --> 09:42.542
and also his guests.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.166
I'm sure it's
very American of me,

09:44.250 --> 09:48.000
but I fail to see what's so
glamorous about lost promise.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.875
"Distinguished" for what?

09:49.959 --> 09:52.208
For doing nothing for
a long time in the same place?

09:52.291 --> 09:54.125
Please God, don't say that.

09:54.208 --> 09:56.041
The only one I like is the boy.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.458
At least he still has
a little life in him.

10:29.625 --> 10:30.750
Where are you off to?

10:32.667 --> 10:35.125
To pick up Nicholas
from the airport.

10:38.166 --> 10:39.583
There are hours yet.

10:40.542 --> 10:43.291
I wanted a drive. With Anne.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.625
- Ah.
- I promised.

10:45.709 --> 10:47.000
I see.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.250
You'll leave Patrick here.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.583
Of course.

10:53.667 --> 10:56.500
- Of course.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.458
Well. His flight lands at two.

11:05.709 --> 11:06.917
Off you go.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.417
Patrick, where on earth
have you been?

11:10.500 --> 11:11.667
Your father's
been calling for you.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.709
- Not now.

11:13.792 --> 11:17.250
- But you said we could.
- Darling, I'm sorry.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.041
I have to pick up Nicholas
from the airport.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.166
There's absolutely nothing
I can do about it.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.417
You promised!

11:22.500 --> 11:24.375
Au revoir! A bientôt!

11:27.166 --> 11:28.625
- No!

11:28.709 --> 11:31.250
Your father
wants you here with him.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.166
I'll stay in the car,
I won't say a word.

11:42.375 --> 11:45.333
I know it's strange...

11:46.083 --> 11:48.458
..but your father gets jealous.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.375
He thinks it's very important

11:51.458 --> 11:54.375
that you're not
too dependent on me.

11:54.458 --> 11:57.291
You mustn't prefer
my company to his.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.125
- I do.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.417
Well, you mustn't let on.

12:05.709 --> 12:07.750
Be very nice to Daddy, yes?

12:07.834 --> 12:11.125
And then you can come
find me before dinner.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.834
Tell me about your day
and I'll tell you about mine.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.291
And I promise...

12:19.542 --> 12:22.417
I swear,
you will have my full attention.

12:25.375 --> 12:28.500
Hello! Here you are!

12:28.583 --> 12:30.625
Just in time.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.458
I hope you're comfortable
in the cottage.

12:32.542 --> 12:35.000
I'd have put you in the house

12:35.083 --> 12:39.375
but you know how David hates
to share anything with anyone,

12:39.458 --> 12:41.709
even air.

12:41.792 --> 12:44.125
Of course at dinner,
he'll be all over you.

12:44.208 --> 12:45.500
Patrick, are you gonna
come with us?

12:45.583 --> 12:47.709
- I do hope so!
- No. No.

12:47.792 --> 12:49.792
American girls only,
I'm afraid.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.500
I'm sure we
can make an exception?

12:51.583 --> 12:54.333
Victor, aren't you terribly hot?

12:54.417 --> 12:56.583
How's the book coming?

12:56.667 --> 12:59.166
Oh, you know.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.709
Identity,
it's a big subject.

13:01.792 --> 13:04.083
Does Freud come into it?

13:04.166 --> 13:05.000
No, no,
I'm not approaching it

13:05.083 --> 13:07.500
from a psychoanalytical
point of view.

13:07.583 --> 13:10.166
Perhaps I should drive.
- No.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.709
No one else drives this car.

13:13.792 --> 13:18.458
It's the one thing
that's still mine alone.

13:18.542 --> 13:21.750
- But it is rather a long way.
- Not the way I drive.

13:26.959 --> 13:28.875
Bye.

13:28.959 --> 13:31.250
Well, young man...

13:31.917 --> 13:34.625
..what have you been up to?

13:41.875 --> 13:43.959
[plaintive piano
playing in another room]

14:10.667 --> 14:12.834
I know you're there.

14:14.583 --> 14:17.667
Hello, Mr. Master Man.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.542
Have they all gone?

14:21.208 --> 14:24.583
Good.
We'll have our special day.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.750
[continues playing
same composition]

14:31.000 --> 14:34.208
Do you recognize this?

14:34.291 --> 14:36.166
You wrote it for me.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.458
When I left Eton,
my father asked me:

14:38.542 --> 14:42.166
"What do you want to do
with your life?"

14:42.250 --> 14:43.625
I didn't dare tell him
I wanted to compose music.

14:43.709 --> 14:46.959
"I don't know, sir," I said.

14:47.041 --> 14:51.208
- "Better join the army."

14:53.667 --> 14:55.625
Hm.

14:58.667 --> 15:01.500
What will you do
with your life...I wonder?

15:01.583 --> 15:04.125
I don't know, sir.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.500
Now...

15:10.375 --> 15:12.625
Shall I pick you up by the ears?

15:12.709 --> 15:15.583
- No!
- Come here.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.792
Ready?

15:27.500 --> 15:29.333
- Now let go!
- No.

15:29.417 --> 15:31.375
- Let go and I'll drop you.
- No!

15:31.458 --> 15:33.667
Trust me. On three. Ready?

15:33.750 --> 15:35.500
One, two, three!

15:35.583 --> 15:38.625
Aaargh! Aaargh!

15:38.709 --> 15:40.625
You've learnt
a very useful lesson today.

15:40.709 --> 15:41.834
- Think for yourself.
- Aaargh!

15:41.917 --> 15:44.291
Never let other people make
important decisions for you.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.375
- Put me down!

15:45.458 --> 15:48.333
- Yeah! Yes! Yes!

15:48.417 --> 15:50.500
You lied to me!
You hurt me!

15:50.583 --> 15:52.291
Don't whimper.
It's very unattractive.

16:16.917 --> 16:18.709
Yaaaargh! Yaargh!

16:23.041 --> 16:24.542
Yaaargh!

16:47.875 --> 16:49.917
Patrick!

17:01.834 --> 17:04.500
- Okay.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.834
- Up the stairs, Patrick.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.917
So who are these Melroses?

17:17.000 --> 17:17.959
David doesn't have a penny.

17:18.041 --> 17:20.917
His terrible father cut him
off.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.375
Left him nothing
but a pair of old pajamas.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.458
What for?

17:24.542 --> 17:26.625
For daring to defy him,
becoming a doctor.

17:26.709 --> 17:28.625
Before that,
he wanted to be a composer.

17:28.709 --> 17:29.917
Could have, too.

17:35.458 --> 17:36.917
Eleanor, on the other hand,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.709
comes from one of the richest
families in America.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.458
All new money, of course,

17:41.542 --> 17:44.000
from the patent
on a dry-cleaning fluid,

17:44.083 --> 17:46.375
but completely loaded.

17:48.959 --> 17:52.500
The house was the first thing
he persuaded her to buy.

17:52.583 --> 17:55.458
First summer there, we were
all sitting on the terrace

17:55.542 --> 17:58.458
and she complained about
the dreadful waste of figs

17:58.542 --> 18:01.625
that fell from the tree onto
the ground and rotted there,

18:01.709 --> 18:04.542
while there were people
starving in the world.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.625
And David did
this amazing thing.

18:06.709 --> 18:09.917
He told Eleanor
to get down on all fours

18:10.000 --> 18:12.917
and eat every fig
off the ground...

18:13.583 --> 18:16.041
- Yes.

18:16.125 --> 18:19.625
She didn't protest, though.
She just ate every single one.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.792
Kinky.

18:32.667 --> 18:35.000
Now that's a meaningful life.

18:35.083 --> 18:38.125
Just like
a Red Indian or something.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.458
Getting up with the sun...

18:42.875 --> 18:43.875
..living off the land,
connected to the earth.

18:43.959 --> 18:45.291
And if you want a chicken,

18:45.375 --> 18:49.083
you have to go out,
and strangle it yourself.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.625
Sounds idyllic.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.583
This is so frustrating.

18:54.875 --> 18:57.792
Attendez.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.542
I wanted to stop for lunch.

19:03.166 --> 19:06.041
So is Patrick looking forward
to going back to school?

19:06.125 --> 19:06.875
Why do people
think they'll please me

19:06.959 --> 19:09.125
by asking about Patrick?

19:10.041 --> 19:13.709
I don't know how he is,
only he knows.

19:13.792 --> 19:15.667
- I'm sorry, I thought--
- Look, you'll see him tonight.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.083
He'll be lurking.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.875
Oh, God. Tonight.

19:19.959 --> 19:23.041
I need a drink.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.417
- No!

19:32.542 --> 19:35.750
Ah, yes, here it is!
Lovely place.

19:35.834 --> 19:36.792
There's Marcel!

19:36.875 --> 19:40.750
Marcel, Marcel!

19:40.834 --> 19:43.542
After the war the Nazis killed
every man in the village

19:43.625 --> 19:44.709
except Marcel.

19:44.792 --> 19:49.542
Which is lucky for us
because the food is wonderful.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.834
Isn't this fun?

19:55.917 --> 19:59.709
American...girls...

20:01.959 --> 20:04.834
Hey.
Hey, wake up!

20:06.000 --> 20:08.750
I'm awake.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.792
You know what I need?
A cognac.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.291
- That's not a good idea.
- Of course it is.

20:14.375 --> 20:17.709
It's exactly what we need
after all this heavy food.

20:19.041 --> 20:20.792
It's for my headache.

20:20.875 --> 20:23.750
Marcel, deux cognacs!

20:24.875 --> 20:26.166
May I speak frankly?

20:26.250 --> 20:29.125
I do hate it
when people say that.

20:29.208 --> 20:32.375
Do you think perhaps you're
drinking a little too much?

20:33.792 --> 20:34.625
Too much for what?

20:34.709 --> 20:38.291
Too much for lunch,
for your own good.

20:38.792 --> 20:42.083
For Patrick's.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.208
Obviously, it's never possible
to know exactly

20:44.291 --> 20:47.792
- what goes on in a family--
- No, it's not.

20:47.875 --> 20:50.041
Especially when
you are neither married

20:50.125 --> 20:52.166
nor have children yourself.

20:54.333 --> 20:57.000
Merci, Marcel.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.750
Extraordinary remark.

21:01.625 --> 21:03.709
Mm.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.709
Seeing as you're so
concerned about my welfare...

21:13.792 --> 21:16.583
you can drive.

21:36.208 --> 21:38.375
- Hello.

21:38.458 --> 21:42.125
- Hello.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.583
Oh, that stew was awfully rich.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.041
- I feel better now.
- Good.

21:50.125 --> 21:52.917
Oh, here it is!
"L'O.K. Corral."

21:53.000 --> 21:55.041
- We have to go!
- Oh.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.792
- It'll be like going home.

21:57.875 --> 21:59.625
Of course! Please?

21:59.709 --> 22:01.542
Please, please, please?

22:01.625 --> 22:03.500
- Sure.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.750
It's terrific!

22:08.834 --> 22:11.583
Look!

22:11.667 --> 22:12.959
A Ferris wheel!

22:19.834 --> 22:21.750
Oh, there's your Cadillac!

22:23.083 --> 22:25.625
You know,
I'm so glad we did this.

22:26.834 --> 22:28.709
Girls' day out.

22:32.542 --> 22:37.625
I'd... I'd like you
to understand something.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.750
He wasn't always like he is now.

22:42.834 --> 22:43.458
David?

22:47.291 --> 22:50.583
When I first met him,
he played so brilliantly.

22:51.500 --> 22:56.166
He was so intelligent
and beautiful.

22:58.125 --> 23:00.000
So different from
all the other English snobs.

23:02.375 --> 23:05.000
We were going to do
wonderful things together...

23:06.417 --> 23:08.917
Useful things.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.709
Of course
he was a difficult man...

23:15.125 --> 23:17.500
..even then.

23:18.375 --> 23:21.625
But I thought
I could turn to him.

23:25.792 --> 23:29.583
The idea of...
turning to him now...

23:32.583 --> 23:35.542
..of being alone
in the same room with him...

23:38.125 --> 23:39.709
Why have we stopped?

23:41.750 --> 23:43.333
I'm sure it's only for a moment.

23:43.417 --> 23:45.250
We're gonna be late
for Nicholas now.

23:45.333 --> 23:48.041
- Oh, just a few minutes.
- And he'll tell David.

23:48.125 --> 23:50.375
I'm sure he won't mind.
A few minutes.

23:50.458 --> 23:51.834
- It's so high.
- There's nothing
to worry about.

23:51.917 --> 23:55.917
Why have we stopped? You mustn't
tell David about any of this.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.083
- Eleanor--
- I beg you.

23:57.166 --> 23:58.917
Eleanor,
are you afraid of him?

23:59.000 --> 23:59.792
You seem afraid.

23:59.875 --> 24:01.917
Let's get off
this fucking thing!

24:02.000 --> 24:04.333
- Eleanor,
you have to stay still.
- Hello!

24:05.333 --> 24:06.417
Hello, down there!

24:06.500 --> 24:09.750
- We wanna get off!
- Eleanor.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.333
- Let us off!
- Eleanor!

24:13.417 --> 24:14.625
Hello!

24:46.667 --> 24:49.834
Bridge.

24:49.917 --> 24:51.333
Bridge, is that you?

24:51.417 --> 24:53.709
Barry! Thank God!

24:53.792 --> 24:57.125
Ohhh! I was literally just
thinking about you this morning.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.875
That is synchronicity, Bridget!

24:58.959 --> 25:00.250
This fabric's amazing!

25:00.333 --> 25:02.291
God, I'm stoned!

25:03.166 --> 25:04.375
What are you doing here?

25:04.458 --> 25:06.458
There's a jazz festival
in Arles.

25:06.542 --> 25:09.375
We're all going!
Hey!

25:09.458 --> 25:11.417
It's gonna be amazing!
You should come!

25:11.500 --> 25:12.750
Oh, you should come.
Come, come, come, come!

25:12.834 --> 25:16.083
I can't! I'm staying with
these Melrose people.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.583
Oh, God.

25:20.291 --> 25:22.709
Let me give you the number.

25:30.291 --> 25:31.667
Nicholas!

25:31.750 --> 25:33.625
- Ah.
- I'm so sorry.

25:33.709 --> 25:37.375
We got caught on a Ferris wheel
and they wouldn't let us off.

25:37.458 --> 25:40.291
Very like you, Eleanor, to get
more fun than you wanted.

25:40.375 --> 25:41.709
Ha-ha. Oh, will you
excuse me just a minute?

25:43.667 --> 25:45.583
What the hell
are you playing at?

25:45.667 --> 25:47.500
I've been carrying
these fucking suitcases around

25:47.583 --> 25:49.333
- looking for you!
- Just get a trolley, man.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.667
- I'm Barry.

you stupid--

25:53.750 --> 25:57.542

26:28.625 --> 26:31.875
Patrick,
tu es en retard. Déjeuner!

26:31.959 --> 26:32.834
Honey.

26:32.917 --> 26:36.458
- I don't want any lunch.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.625
I don't want to be with
my father.

26:41.709 --> 26:44.250

Ce n'est pas possible.

thorn bushes into the ground

Eleanor,
what a sad thing to say.

33:49.041 --> 33:53.625
- Tell me it isn't true.
- Okay...it isn't true.

33:53.709 --> 33:55.834
It's beautiful.

33:57.542 --> 34:01.750
- I want one.
- That's what David said.

- And so I bought it for him.

34:16.375 --> 34:19.375
- Yvette will fetch them.

Perhaps he's drowned
in the bath!

Get up!

34:48.667 --> 34:49.625
I said, get up -
what if David sees you?

34:50.959 --> 34:54.000

Why are you all
so scared of him?

35:01.583 --> 35:02.333
What do you think he's
gonna do to you, Nicholas?

35:02.417 --> 35:03.917
I thought I heard
someone.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.834

35:05.917 --> 35:08.125
How very nice to see you.

35:08.208 --> 35:11.917
Uh...
This is Bridget Watson-Scott.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.542
Hello, my dear.

35:13.625 --> 35:15.959
You have the most
wonderful spot here!

35:16.041 --> 35:19.792
Yes... Just think, with a single
machine gun mounted here

35:19.875 --> 35:22.792
you could dominate
the whole valley.

35:26.417 --> 35:28.333
Stay there, I'll come down.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.709
We'll have tea
beneath the fig tree.

35:35.125 --> 35:37.542
Tell me, are you
going to more weddings

35:37.625 --> 35:39.250
or memorial services?

35:39.333 --> 35:41.542
Oh, I still go to weddings,
but er...

35:41.625 --> 35:43.417
I enjoy the memorials more.

35:43.500 --> 35:46.875
Because you don't
have to bring a present.

35:46.959 --> 35:49.959
One should only go
to an enemy's memorial service.

35:50.041 --> 35:51.083
There's the pleasure
of outliving them,

35:51.166 --> 35:55.583
but also the opportunity
for a truce.

35:55.667 --> 35:57.625
Forgiveness is so important,
don't you think, Bridget?

35:57.709 --> 36:00.333
Gosh, yes.

36:00.417 --> 36:03.375
Especially getting
other people to forgive you.

36:03.458 --> 36:06.250
But why would I need
anyone's forgiveness?

36:07.667 --> 36:11.458
Oh, how can you all
sit out here? It's so bright!

36:13.166 --> 36:16.083

36:27.834 --> 36:30.041
Weird, isn't it?

36:30.125 --> 36:32.834
The way their skin's purple
and white at the same time?

36:32.917 --> 36:36.542
- Like a drunk with emphysema.

36:38.583 --> 36:40.583
This one...

36:40.667 --> 36:42.875
This one is perfect.

37:03.709 --> 37:06.625
Goodness, look!
There's a strange little boy.

37:06.709 --> 37:08.458
That's our son, Patrick.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.542
You have kids? Wow!

37:10.625 --> 37:14.667
Patrick! Darling!
Come on up, we're having tea.

37:14.750 --> 37:17.834
Patrick, come and join us.

37:17.917 --> 37:20.792
- Perhaps he can't hear you.
- Of course he can.

37:20.875 --> 37:22.583
He's just being tiresome.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.750
Perhaps you could
show me to my room,

37:25.834 --> 37:27.792
so I can bath and unpack?

37:27.875 --> 37:30.959
Oh, of course. Come, follow me.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.583
"Only the best or go without."

37:33.667 --> 37:38.417
Always, provided we...
don't have to go without.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.875
She's very...vivacious.

37:41.959 --> 37:44.625
Bridget? Hm.
She'll do for now.

37:44.709 --> 37:47.375
Don't apologize, she's charming.

37:47.458 --> 37:49.458
Sometimes I think
I should be done with it

37:49.542 --> 37:52.000
and settle down with
a well-bred, well-educated,

37:52.083 --> 37:54.667
well-informed woman
whose conversation I can bear.

37:54.750 --> 37:59.166
And then I remember I've...
divorced two of them already.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.083
- Patrick.

38:01.166 --> 38:03.125
Where are you going?

38:11.500 --> 38:13.875
Mummy wanted to see me.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.959
Your mummy's tired
after her drive.

38:16.041 --> 38:17.792
Come and say hello
to your godfather.

38:17.875 --> 38:19.500
Hello, Patrick.

38:19.583 --> 38:22.709
- Almost certainly.

38:22.792 --> 38:25.166
That's what I like to hear.

38:25.250 --> 38:27.250
Come closer.

38:30.125 --> 38:33.792
Hm. Is everything alright?

38:35.959 --> 38:37.875
Yes, Father.

38:37.959 --> 38:38.959
Now we know
you didn't eat lunch.

38:39.041 --> 38:42.542
Did you have tea?

38:42.625 --> 38:43.583
No.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.875
Well, that's
why you're so pale.

38:45.959 --> 38:48.417
You must eat
if you want to grow up strong.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.917
Go and see Yvette,
she'll find you something.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.583
And leave Mummy be today.
Alright?

38:59.667 --> 39:01.458
Dinner at eight.

Because it's important,
when one has so much,

41:15.291 --> 41:18.375
to give something back.

We'll speak to him at
dinner. I'm sure we can
make him agree.

42:31.291 --> 42:32.291
Of course, with Victor,

42:32.375 --> 42:34.583
the great question is
what will he be wearing.

42:34.667 --> 42:37.792
A fisherman's sweater, perhaps,
or something in corduroy?

42:37.875 --> 42:40.208

45:03.333 --> 45:05.583
Oh, hello again,
strange little boy.

45:09.041 --> 45:09.709
You look like a medieval witch.

45:09.792 --> 45:11.583
And you look like an old fart.

45:11.667 --> 45:14.667
A stuffy, conventional old fart!

Um... There's

Oh, thank God!
I don't think I've ever wanted

45:26.709 --> 45:28.667

so much in my life.

45:28.750 --> 45:31.125
Don't ask people
what they do for a living.

45:31.208 --> 45:34.458
And er...don't ask
the staff how they feel.

45:34.542 --> 45:36.250
And don't provoke David.

45:36.333 --> 45:37.583
Fine, but will you do
one thing for me tonight?

45:37.667 --> 45:40.667
- Of course.
- Don't suck up to them.

45:40.750 --> 45:43.542
Don't let them bully you.
Don't try to fit in.

45:43.625 --> 45:45.291
Well, isn't that three things?

45:45.375 --> 45:47.000
They're all connected.

45:47.083 --> 45:49.583
You're as good as these people.
In fact, you're better.

45:49.667 --> 45:52.458
You have warm blood.

45:52.542 --> 45:55.667
- What an extraordinary chair.
- Ah.

45:55.750 --> 45:57.500
It used to belong to some doge.

45:57.583 --> 46:00.166
It really should be in a museum.

46:00.250 --> 46:02.458
Of course
it's David's favorite.

46:02.542 --> 46:05.166
He likes to rest
his cigars on the arm.

46:05.250 --> 46:08.834
Well, I don't think he'll sit
in it if you're in it already.

46:08.917 --> 46:12.166
I wouldn't be so sure.
He does like to get his own way.

46:12.250 --> 46:14.291
Well, hello.
Hi!

46:14.375 --> 46:16.667
For God's sake, Victor,
that suit.

46:16.750 --> 46:19.250
Couldn't you have got Anne
to iron that for you?

46:19.333 --> 46:21.000
- Well, I...

46:21.083 --> 46:22.000
We're barely through the door.

46:22.083 --> 46:23.917
Let's have a pleasant evening,

46:27.750 --> 46:28.917

Nothing a don likes more

46:44.417 --> 46:46.375
than bashing
another man's discipline.

46:46.458 --> 46:48.291
One can hardly call
psychoanalysis a discipline.

46:48.375 --> 46:52.500
- But it helps people.
- Yes, yes, there's
the therapeutic promise.

46:52.583 --> 46:55.291
Here he is - hah -
a real doctor!

46:55.375 --> 46:57.667
Victor, Anne,
a pleasure to see you.

46:58.083 --> 47:00.208
Eleanor...

47:01.250 --> 47:03.083
I do like you in pink.

47:03.166 --> 47:05.083
It matches your eyes.

47:06.291 --> 47:08.375
Is that vodka I see?

47:08.458 --> 47:10.041
Please don't take this
the wrong way

47:10.125 --> 47:13.417
but I find it hard
to imagine you as a doctor.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.041
So did I, my dear,

47:15.125 --> 47:17.333
and I must confess
to stumbling a little

47:17.417 --> 47:18.417
over the Hippocratic Oath.

47:19.417 --> 47:21.750
Fortunately, my wife's money

47:21.834 --> 47:25.583
removed the necessity
of my leading a useful life.

47:25.667 --> 47:27.750
Her great gift.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.917
I appreciate your escorting
my wife to the airport.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.750
It was pure pleasure -
as was this.

47:37.834 --> 47:39.583
Ah. So much pleasure in one day.

47:39.667 --> 47:42.291
My cup runneth over...

47:42.375 --> 47:45.542
I've had a very special day too.
Must be magic in the air.

47:45.625 --> 47:48.125
Hey, Dave.

47:48.208 --> 47:49.917
I love
those kinky yellow slippers.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.291
Do you really like them?
I'm so pleased.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.333
Alcohol's such a crude high.

48:02.417 --> 48:04.500
Let's have dinner.

48:05.083 --> 48:08.083
Victor, you sit there.

48:08.667 --> 48:10.500
No. No...

48:10.583 --> 48:13.667
Anne, you sit next to...

48:13.750 --> 48:14.500
No, that's not right.

48:14.583 --> 48:17.625
Thank God we're only six.

48:17.709 --> 48:20.291
While we wait for Eleanor
to solve the problem,

48:20.375 --> 48:23.875
Anne, tell me, what did
you think of the Emperor Galba?

48:23.959 --> 48:27.709
Oh, terrific.
A terrific character.

48:27.792 --> 48:30.792
Anne was particularly
taken with Caligula.

48:30.875 --> 48:33.750
Victor attempted
to make me feel sorry for him.

48:33.834 --> 48:35.750
Bridget, you sit here with me.

48:35.834 --> 48:38.750
But...Tiberius
killed his whole family.

48:38.834 --> 48:42.250
It's only natural
that those who are terrified

48:42.333 --> 48:44.166
become terrifying,
given the opportunity.

48:46.417 --> 48:48.417
Anne takes a rather
satirical attitude

48:48.500 --> 48:49.959
to the English
public school system.

48:50.041 --> 48:53.208
- And as to his obsession
with screwing his sisters--

48:53.291 --> 48:54.458
Oh, well,
you know what they say.

48:54.542 --> 48:55.917
Vice is nice,
but incest is best.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.834
Now, I'm sure
I'd have liked the chap.

48:57.917 --> 48:59.792
He did exactly
what he wanted to do

48:59.875 --> 49:02.291
with no nonsense about ethics.

49:02.375 --> 49:04.500
Why do you think
it's superior to be amoral?

49:04.583 --> 49:05.834
It's not a question
of being superior:

49:05.917 --> 49:07.709
it's a question of not
being a bore or a prig.

49:07.792 --> 49:11.458
What one aims for is ennui.

49:14.750 --> 49:16.750
♪♪

49:33.667 --> 49:37.083
Eleanor, what a
marvelous memory you have,

49:37.166 --> 49:39.959
to be able to duplicate
the dinner we had last time.

49:40.041 --> 49:42.625
She has that expression
she puts on

49:42.709 --> 49:45.375
when she's thinking of
her dear, rich dead mother.

49:50.709 --> 49:52.750
Yes, David.

49:52.834 --> 49:54.542
Once Eleanor's
dear father had been dismissed

49:54.625 --> 49:57.083
for being too drunk,

49:57.166 --> 50:00.583
Eleanor's mother decided
to purchase a human antique.

50:01.208 --> 50:03.917
A "real, old aristocrat",

50:04.041 --> 50:05.834
on the grounds that if
you're going to buy a husband,

50:05.917 --> 50:08.959
he might as well be a duke.

50:09.041 --> 50:11.709
And so the Duc de Valencay

50:11.792 --> 50:15.208
was re-upholstered
with thick wads of dollars.

50:15.291 --> 50:20.333
But you just can't treat
human beings like things.

50:20.417 --> 50:22.542
- Definitely.

50:22.625 --> 50:23.792
Definitely.

50:23.875 --> 50:25.750
Maybe the human antique
wanted to be bought.

50:25.834 --> 50:27.375
Oh, I've no doubt of that.

50:27.458 --> 50:29.500
I'm sure
he was licking the windowpane.

50:29.583 --> 50:32.792
What so shocked Eleanor's mother
was that he dared to rear up

50:32.875 --> 50:35.709
on his Louis XV legs
and start giving orders.

50:35.792 --> 50:36.792
You see,
I feel that so strongly.

50:36.875 --> 50:38.083
That the problem with the world

50:38.166 --> 50:41.583
is people treating
other people like things.

50:41.667 --> 50:45.000
I so agree. That's something
else we have in common.

50:45.083 --> 50:48.583
Things...should be treated
with great care.

50:49.542 --> 50:51.583
Excuse me.

50:56.041 --> 50:58.792
"What one aims for is ennui"!

51:12.125 --> 51:15.458
- Hello, Patrick.
- I broke a glass.

51:15.542 --> 51:17.834
Don't tell my father.

51:17.917 --> 51:20.458
You look so grim.

51:20.542 --> 51:22.625
What's up?

51:24.917 --> 51:27.875
Can't you get to sleep?

51:30.959 --> 51:33.166
Does it hurt?
Let me see if it's--

51:33.250 --> 51:35.458
- No, I only wanted to--
- I'm fine.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.709
You're shaking.

51:40.917 --> 51:43.500
Do you want to tell me?
What is it?

51:44.667 --> 51:46.917
Patrick?

51:47.000 --> 51:49.250
I gather that Gerald Frogmore

51:49.333 --> 51:53.083
shot more birds last year
than anyone in England.

51:53.166 --> 51:56.875
Not bad
for a chap in a wheelchair.

51:56.959 --> 51:59.792
Perhaps he resents
their freedom of movement.

52:01.375 --> 52:05.458
I mean, what about your mother?
Do you want to tell your mother?

52:05.542 --> 52:09.125
Okay, I'll be right back.
I promise.

52:12.917 --> 52:15.041
I don't believe you.

52:16.583 --> 52:18.542
You say you will but you won't.

52:18.625 --> 52:20.709
Patrick, I will.

52:22.792 --> 52:24.542
Everyone
enjoyed themselves,

52:24.625 --> 52:27.041
even the man
who was being hanged.

52:27.125 --> 52:28.750
- Fun for all the family.
- I found Patrick on the stairs.

52:28.834 --> 52:31.834
He wants to talk to you.

52:33.458 --> 52:37.208
I thought we'd agreed that you
wouldn't rush to Patrick

52:37.291 --> 52:39.542
each time
he whines and blubbers.

52:39.625 --> 52:42.709
He fell earlier
so he... he may be hurt.

52:42.792 --> 52:43.792
In that case
he may need a doctor.

52:43.875 --> 52:46.667
He's not hurt. He just wants
to talk to his mother.

52:46.750 --> 52:48.041
You see, darling?
He isn't hurt.

52:48.125 --> 52:52.583
And so it's just
a question of sentiment.

52:52.667 --> 52:55.709
Does one allow oneself
to be blackmailed or not?

53:05.166 --> 53:06.375
If you sit, we can discuss it.

53:24.959 --> 53:29.458
The proposition I'd like
to make is that education

53:29.542 --> 53:31.917
should be something of
which a child can later say:

53:32.041 --> 53:34.834
"If I survived that,
I can survive anything."

53:34.917 --> 53:37.000
Well, that's crazy and wrong
and you know it!

53:37.083 --> 53:39.792
Well, I certainly think
a child should be challenged--

53:39.875 --> 53:41.125
Oh, for goodness sakes, Victor!

53:41.208 --> 53:44.041
Well, nobody wants anyone to be
miserable. We're just saying--

53:44.125 --> 53:46.792
We! Because God forbid
you should ever contradict him.

53:46.875 --> 53:48.375
..it doesn't do a child
any good to be molly-coddled.

53:48.458 --> 53:50.458
I know it's an unfashionable
point of view,

53:50.542 --> 53:54.041
but in my opinion,
nothing that happens to you

53:54.125 --> 53:55.625
as a child really matters.

53:55.709 --> 53:57.667
When it comes to things
that don't matter,

53:57.750 --> 53:59.041
you're top of my list.

53:59.125 --> 54:00.750
- Saying silly things
to sound less pompous--
- Oh, my word!

54:00.834 --> 54:03.917
- and pompous things
to sound less silly.
- A ferocious backhand there

54:04.000 --> 54:05.959
- from the young American lefty.
- It's pathetic.

54:06.041 --> 54:06.917
Well, nothing that happened
in your childhood

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
did matter, Nicholas.

54:09.083 --> 54:11.291
You just did exactly
what everyone expected.

54:11.375 --> 54:13.333
Well, I refuse to apologize
for an uneventful childhood,

54:13.417 --> 54:17.792
or to relish the suffering
over the happiness:

54:17.875 --> 54:20.625
- big lawns, buckets and spades,

54:20.709 --> 54:23.166
throwing coins into
the golden pool at the Ritz.

54:23.250 --> 54:27.750
Would you like a fig? They're
at their best this time of year.

54:27.834 --> 54:29.417
Go on -
I know how much you like them.

54:31.250 --> 54:33.125
I'll need a knife.

54:33.208 --> 54:35.125
I'm sorry,
I've really tried here,

54:35.208 --> 54:37.542
but I can't do this anymore.

54:37.625 --> 54:40.500
You... You are a pompous,
silly little sycophant.

54:40.583 --> 54:44.250
And the only thing in your favor
is that you frighten him.

54:44.333 --> 54:46.542
That aside, you're a failure.

54:46.625 --> 54:51.166
And it's your son I feel sorry
for, and if I had my way then...

54:51.250 --> 54:53.917
Victor, stay with your friends
by all means,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.375
- but if you do then I never
want to see you again.
- No, no, I'm coming with you.

54:56.458 --> 54:57.291
Must you leave so soon?

54:57.375 --> 55:01.083
Yes, Eleanor,
I have to be up early

55:01.166 --> 55:04.834
to er...make some...
some progress on my book.

55:04.917 --> 55:08.166
Eleanor,
Patrick is in the hallway.

55:08.250 --> 55:10.834
He is sad
and he's lonely and scared.

55:10.917 --> 55:12.917
And I promised
I'd bring you with me.

55:13.000 --> 55:13.875
Will you come and find out
what's happened?

55:19.291 --> 55:20.417
Eleanor

55:24.875 --> 55:26.709
Eleanor.

55:51.250 --> 55:53.959
For someone so conventional,

55:54.041 --> 55:56.750
Victor does love
an unconventional girlfriend.

55:56.834 --> 55:58.375
Almost nothing
is as entertaining

55:58.458 --> 56:02.291
as the contortions
of a clever Jewish snob.

56:02.375 --> 56:03.917
Very broad-minded of you

56:04.000 --> 56:05.333
to have one in the house at all.

56:05.417 --> 56:07.041
Oh, do fuck off,
the pair of you.

56:10.375 --> 56:13.333
- Thank you.
- No, you were right.

56:13.417 --> 56:15.792
In the end
one must oppose cruelty,

56:15.875 --> 56:18.166
even if only
by refusing to take part.

56:19.125 --> 56:21.834
- I have no idea!

56:28.083 --> 56:30.208
Oh, one moment.

56:33.542 --> 56:34.917
Patrick?

56:36.542 --> 56:39.375
Patrick? It's only me!

56:48.208 --> 56:51.125
He must have gone to bed.

56:51.834 --> 56:53.917
Oh, well.

56:57.792 --> 57:01.000
- Barry, you are saving my life.

57:06.125 --> 57:09.250
They're desperate

Mummy's keen on roses,
Daddy loves the gee-gees.

57:12.917 --> 57:16.041
I took them up to Covent Garden
to see Le Nozze di Figaro,

57:16.125 --> 57:18.834
and when the conductor
came on the podium,

57:18.917 --> 57:19.792
Rodney Watson-Scott said,
