WEBVTT

00:39.473 --> 00:40.641
I don't want any trouble.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.444
Oh, you don't want
any trouble?

00:45.213 --> 00:46.280
All yours, Sonny.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.681
Take 'em down, Sonny.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.083
You should've thought about
that a long time ago.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.219
Thought about what?

00:56.290 --> 00:57.658
Come on, get up.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.244
Come on.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.620
Mayor Chase!

01:26.720 --> 01:28.289
Hey, when are you gonna fix
all the potholes?

01:28.389 --> 01:30.558
I didn't vote for you.

01:30.658 --> 01:31.759
Hey, Mr. Mayor,
can I take a picture?

01:31.859 --> 01:33.461
All right, folks,
late for lunch.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.563
Ah, you again?

01:35.663 --> 01:37.431
What's the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Not happy to see me?

01:37.531 --> 01:38.666
You've been harassing
me all day.

01:38.766 --> 01:39.867
Just exercising
my right to free speech.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.369
You're a public
figure, remember?

01:41.469 --> 01:43.504
You answer to the public,
isn't that right?

01:43.604 --> 01:44.872
Can you take care
of this, please?

01:44.972 --> 01:46.774
Thank you.
This is illegal.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.743
You can't do this.
You can't detain me.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.645
I am well within
my rights to be here.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.014
This is a public sidewalk.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.048
You see what's happening?

01:55.149 --> 01:56.150
This could happen to you.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.051
I have a right to speak out

01:58.152 --> 01:59.720
to a public figure.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.455
This is what's happening
to all of us...
That's enough.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.427
I know I'm always the
one to say, "Yeah, but,"

02:06.527 --> 02:08.162
but there's
something else.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.564
Let me guess. He's a cop.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.202
You know the guy?
No.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.169
But you recognize him.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.604
No, but I can do the math

02:16.704 --> 02:19.072
about you being in here
playing this for me.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.508
And he is off duty?

02:20.608 --> 02:22.476
That's right, boss.
Well, then we're good.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.878
I'm not so sure about that.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.481
Oh.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.951
The mayor we know and love is
not gonna take this lying down.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.687
Especially since the D.A.'s
office already sprung our guy.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.123
Well, yeah, what he did
isn't a crime.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.558
Be that as it may,

02:37.658 --> 02:38.759
there is still the
public relations concern.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.594
You mean the political.
That, too.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.396
Well, I don't give a damn
about either.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.631
Frank!
Garrett,

02:43.731 --> 02:46.200
before you start
going down the road

02:46.300 --> 02:47.901
about how unreasonable I am,

02:48.001 --> 02:51.138
let me remind you that this
"camera in your face" thing

02:51.239 --> 02:54.708
is what every cop in the city
deals with every day.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.109
A hundred percent.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.611
Which is what I'm guessing

02:57.711 --> 03:00.381
this cop is trying to demonstrate.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.750
So, let's just give him
a medal instead?

03:02.850 --> 03:05.653
Technically, it'd be
a commendation, Garrett.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.858
Garrett, we ask our cops
to suck it up and ignore it

03:10.958 --> 03:16.129
every time John Q. Public
springs a <i>60 Minutes</i> ambush.

03:16.230 --> 03:20.634
The least we can do
is hold their boss, our mayor,

03:20.734 --> 03:22.270
to the same standard.

03:22.370 --> 03:25.273
You're not looking to start
a fight with the mayor?

03:25.373 --> 03:27.107
No.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.410
But I won't back down
from one either.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.518
How are you holding up?

03:37.618 --> 03:40.288
Happy I'm alive, to be honest.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.555
That was
a pretty bad beating.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.990
We're sorry about that.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.692
And for no reason.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.827
Like, none whatsoever.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.563
Did you know these guys at all?
Have any dealings with them?

03:49.663 --> 03:51.699
Did I know them?

03:51.799 --> 03:53.601
I never saw those thugs
before in my life.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.404
Any ideas as to why
they targeted you?

03:56.504 --> 03:57.838
I was minding my own business

03:57.938 --> 03:59.707
and these guys decided
to jump me.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.809
Maybe you can help us
with a description.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.277
What'd they look like?

04:03.377 --> 04:06.980
They were mostly Asian guys.
Like a dozen of them.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.717
All of them on these
scooters or bikes.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.119
It was happening
at hyper speed. Like...

04:12.219 --> 04:15.556
a swarm descending on me at like
a hundred miles an hour.

04:15.656 --> 04:19.159
Is there any details
you can try to remember?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.694
Maybe a name?

04:20.794 --> 04:22.963
An article of clothing
that stood out?

04:23.063 --> 04:24.432
Sonny.

04:24.532 --> 04:27.835
Yeah, one of them kept
calling the main guy Sonny.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.637
Sonny.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.506
What?
Nothing.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.542
What, you know
the guy or something?

04:34.642 --> 04:35.776
We're gonna have to check

04:35.876 --> 04:36.977
surveillance cameras
in the area.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.246
You rest up.
We'll be in touch.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.017
I got to be honest
with you, Reagan,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.587
I'm putting you
in a bad spot here.
Bad spot?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.055
So whatever you're
about to say about

04:48.155 --> 04:50.157
how you don't want to
do this or it's unfair,

04:50.257 --> 04:52.025
I've been playing the scene
in my head a million times,

04:52.125 --> 04:54.127
so asked and answered
if you know what I'm saying.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.463
I don't.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.097
And another thing.
I wish I could tell you

04:57.197 --> 04:58.632
I was tapping you for this
'cause you're my top dog.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.167
But the truth is
you're green as hell

05:00.267 --> 05:02.202
and we got conflicts
up the wazoo.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.604
Conflicts, Lieutenant?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.339
I guess you're the wrong
man at the right time.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.608
Would you mind telling me
what's going on here, boss?

05:07.708 --> 05:10.478
Before I proceed, keep in mind
that everything we say in here

05:10.578 --> 05:11.945
is being recorded.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.147
The first voice
you're gonna hear

05:14.247 --> 05:16.016
belongs to Malcolm Argus,
known drug dealer.

05:16.116 --> 05:19.920
The second voice belongs to
one of his unknown associates.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.723
It's got to be
after 4:00 on the 12th.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.492
That's the time
my cop works the sector.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.861
Okay, so either
the 12th or the 13th.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.363
Listen to me. The 12th.
Only the 12th.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.264
Any other day
and I don't know if my guy

05:31.365 --> 05:33.033
is gonna be working.
Has to be the 12th.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.502
And he's gonna look
the other way?

05:34.602 --> 05:35.836
Hundred percent green light.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.004
What about his partner?

05:37.104 --> 05:38.872
Not a problem.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.775
Boss?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.811
You heard Argus mention
a specific sector

05:43.911 --> 05:46.179
and a specific date and time.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.381
Yeah.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.720
That's the 2-9's
roll call for the 12th.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.991
Badillo and Janko.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.966
That's definitely Sonny.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.502
Looks like you inspired him
to commit more crimes.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.171
Very funny.
I'll see you at the car.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.006
Reagan.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.241
Hey, Reagan, you got a sec?

06:48.341 --> 06:50.110
No. I don't.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.645
What do you mean no?
I got to talk to you.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.313
Yeah, you know, in all
the years I've known you,

06:53.413 --> 06:56.116
never once have you come
to talk to me with good news.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.285
Well, what can I say?
You're the problem solver.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.320
Like the great
Wizard of Oz.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.522
Humble am I
in your presence.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.356
Mm-hmm.
What's it about?

07:03.457 --> 07:06.159
Your sister.
See ya,
wouldn't wanna be ya.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.761
No, no, no, no.
Come on, come on, Danny.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.797
Come on, this is serious.
I need your help.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.932
Mm-hmm. And does Erin
know you're here?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.166
Of course not.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.702
Well, then
there you go, okay?

07:14.802 --> 07:17.905
It's never a good idea
to do anything for my sister

07:18.005 --> 07:19.740
especially when
it's behind her back.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.743
Jack Boyle is trying to hook her
up with Warren Bradford.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.445
The billionaire
Warren Bradford?
Yeah.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.748
Says he's willing to stake
her campaign for her.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.950
Sounds like a love connection
to me, Chuck Woolery--

07:30.050 --> 07:31.485
"Back in two and two."

07:32.653 --> 07:34.021
Look.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.590
Jack Boyle and Warren Bradford
coming out of Peter Luger's

07:36.690 --> 07:38.792
after a three-hour dinner.
Why wasn't I invited?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.360
Look closely.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.564
Look who they're with.
Wait a minute.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.299
Nicky the Gent
and Tommy Basile?

07:46.399 --> 07:47.568
Two known mob figures.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.169
Not exactly
the kind of company

07:49.269 --> 07:51.138
we want Erin keeping
company with

07:51.238 --> 07:53.006
even if it's by association.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.341
True.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.877
Except Warren is not
the problem, Anthony.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.345
It's Jack.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.948
He's got dozens of
clients like this.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.283
And I got a case to work.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.223
Oh, got 'em.
Oh, come on.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.060
Ah...

08:16.063 --> 08:17.164
Ooh.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.601
Eddie, you got a minute?
What?

08:20.701 --> 08:22.970
Oh, Jamie, hey.
Where did you come from?

08:23.070 --> 08:25.038
Got a minute?

08:25.138 --> 08:27.440
Yeah, sure,
what's going on?

08:34.147 --> 08:35.783
Do you know this guy?

08:37.084 --> 08:38.652
No, I don't think so.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.120
What do you mean
you don't think so?

08:40.220 --> 08:41.822
Just that. I don't
think I know him.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.191
Well, you either do
or you don't.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.159
Not much you really
have to think about, right?

08:46.259 --> 08:48.596
Jamie, what's going on?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.098
His name is Malcolm Argus.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.133
He's a known drug dealer
who works in the neighborhood.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.434
Oh, I see.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.936
No, I don't think
we've ever crossed paths.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.871
You don't think so?
Oh, geez,
here we go again.

08:57.971 --> 09:01.408
Jamie, I have never
crossed paths with him.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.876
Okay, because he usually
conducts business

09:02.976 --> 09:04.177
in your sector.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.445
Do you think I'm lying
or something?
No.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.814
No, no, no.
Nothing like that.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.949
Why are you asking me
so many questions?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.151
No reason.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.519
No reason?

09:12.620 --> 09:14.655
When you took this job

09:14.755 --> 09:16.924
you said we weren't allowed
to talk about work anymore.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.793
And... that seems to be
what you're doing.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.896
This is not that big a deal.
Forget I asked.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.298
Jamie, is there something
I need to know about?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.601
No, forget it.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.270
Okay.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.376
Terminate Officer Stokes.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.512
I can't do that.
You mean won't.

09:39.613 --> 09:43.016
No, I mean I can't.
I do not have the authority.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.018
You're the police commissioner
and he's a cop!

09:45.118 --> 09:46.887
Who has done nothing wrong.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.456
He spent the entire day
stalking me

09:49.556 --> 09:51.124
and shoving his camera
in my face

09:51.224 --> 09:53.226
and trying to provoke me
and you bet that's wrong!

09:53.326 --> 09:56.329
But that is exactly
what my officers contend with

09:56.429 --> 09:59.266
on a daily basis and it's legal.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.703
And I suspect it's the reason
he came after you.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.171
And what's the point?

10:04.271 --> 10:05.572
The same one you're making.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.175
It ought to be illegal
to taunt and provoke

10:08.275 --> 10:10.878
and record while someone's
trying to do their job.

10:10.978 --> 10:14.414
Oh, you're playing games
with me, Frank.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.752
No. I am telling you
the way it is.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.388
Mr. Mayor, my hands are tied.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.390
Because you want them to be.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.728
If you're asking me if I agree

10:27.828 --> 10:31.799
with what Officer Stokes
is doing, the answer is...

10:31.899 --> 10:33.100
sort of.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.402
Sort of?

10:35.502 --> 10:39.773
I don't love his method,
but his frustration is valid

10:39.873 --> 10:42.542
and it is shared
by the rank and file.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.913
I won't be an object lesson
for your cops.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.781
Well, in this case...

10:47.881 --> 10:50.818
it's not your choice or mine.

10:50.918 --> 10:54.988
Right, of course, it's legal,
so your hands are tied.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.091
Mine aren't.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.298
Damn Sonny.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.501
Upset he didn't take you up on
your offer to come on the job?

11:08.601 --> 11:09.737
You're making fun?

11:09.837 --> 11:12.139
No! I'm giving you
an A-plus for effort.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.941
That's another way
of you making fun.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.410
Well, if it walks like a duck
and eats banh mi...

11:17.510 --> 11:19.312
Yeah.
Hey, Sonny!

11:22.315 --> 11:23.884
Come on.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.795
Hey, what's the matter,
Detective?

11:34.895 --> 11:36.296
Oh, you're not happy to see me?

11:36.396 --> 11:37.865
No, I'm not.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.299
Hey, you got this
all wrong, bro.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.434
No, I don't.
We saw what you did.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.236
Come on, you got to
hear me out, bro.

11:43.336 --> 11:47.240
We tried that before.
Obviously, you didn't listen.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.644
Yo, bro...

11:51.745 --> 11:53.246
can I talk to you
for one second?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.582
Call me bro one more time,
I'm gonna jam on the brakes

11:55.682 --> 11:57.684
and launch you through
the windshield.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.720
Sorry, Detective.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.689
That's better.
So, can I talk to you?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.124
We already tried that.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.425
Didn't work out too well.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.894
That's what I want to
talk to you about.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.296
You want to talk to me
about talking to me?

12:09.396 --> 12:10.697
You got this wrong.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.132
So, you didn't put a
beatdown on that guy?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.301
Cause we saw the video,
didn't we?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.869
Yes, we did.
He had it coming.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.238
No, you got it coming!
Danny, watch out!

12:25.345 --> 12:26.279
Stay put.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.614
Hey.

12:27.714 --> 12:30.150
Hey, you okay?
What happened?

12:38.658 --> 12:40.727
Sonny, hey! Sonny!

12:40.828 --> 12:43.797
Hey! Hey! Sonny!

12:49.669 --> 12:51.204
This is a disaster.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.672
It doesn't have to be.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.107
What do you mean
"It doesn't have to be"?

12:54.207 --> 12:56.109
We lost a prisoner.
It happens.

12:56.209 --> 13:00.447
It doesn't happen to <i>me.</i>
Well, there is a first
time for everything.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.582
This isn't funny, you know.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.452
They weren't
your cuffs on him.
I'm not saying it's funny.

13:05.552 --> 13:08.421
I'm just saying it's only
as bad as we allow it to be.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.557
And it's bad.
Let's just put our
heads together,

13:10.657 --> 13:13.760
calmly, and try to figure out
how we're going to find him.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.195
Fine.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.696
Nice and easy.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.466
You're a dead man,
you son of a bitch!

13:19.566 --> 13:22.535
Detective, I swear to you,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.671
I had nothing to do with that.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.074
My crew overreacted.
I'm sorry.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.809
Oh, you're so sorry
that you ran off anyway?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.144
The heat of the moment.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.779
Truth is, Sam Isaac

13:32.880 --> 13:34.481
isn't who you think he is.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.583
He got beat down
for a very good reason.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.751
Great, tell me all about it
when you come in.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.889
Take a guess... on how many
young Vietnamese girls

13:41.989 --> 13:43.656
he's put in the hospital.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.526
Yeah, you didn't know
about that, did you?

13:46.626 --> 13:49.897
Look, you want to make
a complaint, you come on in

13:49.997 --> 13:52.265
sit down with me, I'll take
your statement personally.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.533
How's that?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.068
I already delivered
my statement.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.937
And now you got five years
hanging over your head

13:57.037 --> 13:57.938
because of it.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.107
He's a bad guy, man.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.608
I'm telling you.
He had it coming.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.511
Sonny, you know what?
I used to like you.

14:04.611 --> 14:08.081
And in my gut I really want to
believe you right now.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.616
But the only way I can help you

14:09.716 --> 14:11.885
is if you come in
and tell me what you know,

14:11.985 --> 14:14.721
you help me nail this guy,
then I'll help you.

14:14.821 --> 14:15.755
How's that?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.892
Yeah, not while you're still
looking to nail me.

14:18.992 --> 14:22.195
I can't do anything
to help you with him

14:22.295 --> 14:24.231
until you tell me
everything you know.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.732
Don't you get that?

14:25.832 --> 14:27.534
Everything you need to know
is in your inbox.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.369
What are you talking about
"In my inbox"?

14:29.469 --> 14:31.471
"You've got mail."

14:31.571 --> 14:32.605
So--

14:36.876 --> 14:39.812
That was quick.
You got something for me?

14:39.913 --> 14:41.714
I got nothing.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.351
Okay, then, why are you here
eating up my time?

14:44.451 --> 14:47.187
That's exactly my question.
Why am I here?

14:47.287 --> 14:49.022
Well, if you don't know
and I don't know,

14:49.122 --> 14:50.290
I'm not sure we'll ever know.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.591
So back when
you've got something.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.526
I mean, why am I in this
bureau, Lieutenant?

14:53.626 --> 14:56.263
Why do you think you're
here, Sergeant Reagan?

14:56.363 --> 14:57.797
Well, I thought my C.O.
thought I'd be a good fit,

14:57.897 --> 14:59.432
but she also wanted
to keep me in the 2-9.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.134
And now you're not
so sure?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.735
I'm pretty sure.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.771
I'm just not sure
if <i>you</i> want me here.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.006
Makes you say that?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.640
My wife is not a dirty cop.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.776
Officer Edit Janko
is not a dirty cop.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.644
Nobody is saying she is.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.046
Really? Because you came
pretty close

15:13.146 --> 15:14.281
to insinuating that
the last time I was here.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.415
So, is this some kind of a test?

15:15.515 --> 15:16.883
What kind of a test?

15:16.984 --> 15:19.452
A test to see
if I can be trusted.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.421
If I'll tell my wife
that she's under suspicion?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.390
Did you?
No.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.458
But I don't like being put
in this position.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.194
So if my former C.O.
jammed me down your throat,

15:27.294 --> 15:30.130
then cut me loose,
but I don't want to get set up!

15:37.904 --> 15:39.039
Do you want out?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.173
That's not what I'm saying.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.441
No, but it's what I'm asking.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.310
No, but if I'm not wanted--

15:43.410 --> 15:45.578
Your C.O. didn't put you here.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.148
It came from
much higher than that.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.216
My father?

15:49.316 --> 15:51.084
No.
Then who?

15:51.184 --> 15:52.852
Me.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.423
You?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.727
I've had my eye on you
for a long time, Reagan.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.862
Years. So no.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.464
I'm not trying to
run you out of here.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.233
And I'm not
setting you up to fail.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.501
I handpicked you.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.539
I didn't know that, boss.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.973
Thank you.
And I wouldn't
have done that

16:14.074 --> 16:16.443
if I thought your wife
was dirty. She's not.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.946
But her partner...
might be.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.683
So...

16:23.783 --> 16:25.618
You see what
you can dig up.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.986
You find out
Officer Badillo's dirty,

16:27.087 --> 16:29.322
we go straight to IAB.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.595
Geez. What'd this guy do?
Write a novel?

16:35.695 --> 16:38.665
Affidavits from neighborhood
Vietnamese girls

16:38.765 --> 16:40.600
who Sonny says were assaulted.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.336
Any of what Sonny says
check out?

16:44.637 --> 16:45.838
It's a list of names.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.041
And times and locations
they were attacked.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.044
Mm. Sonny put this together
all by himself?

16:51.144 --> 16:52.512
I checked our computer.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.914
Some of the same assault
complaints are in our system.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.616
Same time, same location.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.851
Except none of the victims
were cooperative on the scene

16:58.951 --> 17:00.587
because no one talks
in Little Vietnam.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.224
Well, no one talks to us.
They talk to Sonny quite a bit.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.825
That's true.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.660
How many of these
statements we got?
Over a dozen.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.396
They're all saying
the same thing.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.731
"I was walking alone,
minding my business.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.933
"A white male
comes out of nowhere.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.768
Punches me.
Beats me down."

17:15.868 --> 17:17.104
Let me guess,
every one of them

17:17.204 --> 17:19.206
matches the description
of Sam Isaac.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.741
White. Male. 30s. Beard.

17:21.841 --> 17:25.778
So, we're thinking
Sonny is right?
We know Sonny's right.

17:25.878 --> 17:29.015
This video was attached
to the email Sonny sent.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.668
Oh, that sure looks
like Sam Isaac to me.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.638
Look, I'm not gonna say it...

17:51.738 --> 17:54.741
Your saying you're not
gonna say you told me so

17:54.841 --> 17:56.376
is saying you told me so.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.477
Well, I did tell you so.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.678
And now you've told me

17:58.778 --> 18:00.113
you told me so twice.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.715
Mayor's taken his issue
with Officer Stokes

18:02.815 --> 18:04.651
to the Civilian
Complaint Review Board.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.653
He's requesting
they terminate him.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.222
Anything else?

18:09.322 --> 18:10.957
That's it?

18:11.057 --> 18:12.659
No response?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.628
And what would you have me do?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.063
At least acknowledge

18:17.164 --> 18:18.898
that this whole thing
could've been avoided.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.067
Well, of course the whole thing
could have been avoided

18:21.168 --> 18:24.003
if I just got down
on my knees and begged.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.338
A bit of an exaggeration.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.006
Not really, no.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.276
You could've just slow-walked
it till he forgot about it.

18:29.376 --> 18:32.612
Could have. Would not.
And so turned
a one-day story

18:32.712 --> 18:34.714
into a whole-week story.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.717
A whole-week story and the issue
that's front and center

18:37.817 --> 18:40.453
on every news outlet
in the city.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.589
And it is my guess that
that is exactly

18:42.689 --> 18:45.057
what Officer Stokes
was hoping for.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.494
I got to be honest, boss.
The cops love it.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.995
The guy's a hero.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.563
And having his back
isn't hurting

18:50.663 --> 18:52.064
your standing with the rank
and file either.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.733
Could you two please not?

18:54.867 --> 18:56.903
I support his position. Same.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.138
And when we lose
this silly fight?

18:59.239 --> 19:01.208
We go down with Stokes.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.079
Who said anything about losing?

19:15.922 --> 19:17.824
All right, Jackie boy, let's see

19:17.924 --> 19:20.527
what wiseguy you're
breaking bread with today.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.411
You ready?
Yeah.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.546
Isaac checked out
of the hospital.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.948
Got his last known.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.583
Be honest,
you feel a little better

19:43.683 --> 19:44.951
about the whole
Sonny thing, huh?

19:45.051 --> 19:47.354
You mean, Sonny the vigilante
escaped fugitive?

19:47.454 --> 19:49.722
Well, there's that.
Mm-hmm.
There's only that.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.191
Well, no. There's a lot
more and you know it.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.460
He did better police work

19:53.560 --> 19:55.127
than a lot of
our own detectives.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.563
And your point is?

19:56.663 --> 19:59.366
Maybe you got through
to him after all. Oh.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.468
I tried to get him
to go straight.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.736
I even tried to talk him
into becoming a cop.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.505
You know, obviously,
he's got the head for it.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.607
But he always chooses
street justice.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.409
All I'm saying is
there's a win here

20:09.509 --> 20:12.445
if you're willing
to take it.
There is no win.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.447
This guy really loves

20:14.547 --> 20:16.082
bringing you gifts, huh?

20:16.182 --> 20:19.018
Yeah. Just the kind of
gifts I don't want.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.555
Hello, Sam.
What brings you here?

20:24.524 --> 20:25.892
What's that?

20:25.992 --> 20:27.694
I think he said
he didn't do anything. Oh.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.498
What?
And he said

20:31.598 --> 20:33.333
the guy Sonny is crazy.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.968
Uh-huh.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.804
He's half right.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.846
Excuse me, have you
seen my friend Sonny around?

20:51.851 --> 20:54.153
Sonny?
You seen him?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.755
He's the most popular
guy in town.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.457
Nobody's seen him around?

20:57.557 --> 20:58.691
Excuse me.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.293
Have any of you seen
my friend Sonny?

21:00.393 --> 21:03.763
He's my good friend. We...

21:04.664 --> 21:05.932
You see that?
She spoke English.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.000
She just doesn't
want to help us.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.636
Hey, buddy.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.639
Listen, this is my friend Sonny.
I've seen you with him.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.874
Will you tell me where
I can find him?

21:14.974 --> 21:16.909
He's not in trouble.
I just got to talk to him.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.778
I don't think
he liked you very much.
Well, I don't like him either.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.113
He's got to be around
here somewhere.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.615
I mean, this guy
hasn't left Little Vietnam

21:22.715 --> 21:25.585
since the day
he was born.
That's true.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.755
It's also true that nobody here
is gonna help us find him.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.156
You never know.

21:30.256 --> 21:31.924
Well, I know that neither
one of us is Vietnamese.

21:32.024 --> 21:35.695
I also know that Sonny is
way too powerful around here.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.631
That's why we need to find
someone with more power.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.500
You think a bunch of gamblers

21:40.600 --> 21:44.471
are gonna help us out?
If properly
motivated, perhaps.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.711
Anthony,
what are you doing here?

21:51.811 --> 21:54.381
I'm just admiring
your family photos.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.248
What are you talking about?

21:59.285 --> 22:00.987
What the hell is that?

22:01.087 --> 22:02.555
That's what
I'd like to know.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.123
Where did this come from?

22:04.223 --> 22:06.759
Yours truly.
You're spying on me?

22:06.859 --> 22:08.127
Try looking out for you.

22:08.227 --> 22:11.163
By taking creepy
surveillance photos of me?

22:11.263 --> 22:12.465
Well, they're not supposed
to be of you.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.933
I was staking out Jack.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.436
Oh, that's so much better.
Get out of my chair.

22:19.772 --> 22:23.109
Why are you pulling
a stakeout on Jack?

22:23.209 --> 22:25.311
To protect you.
From what?

22:25.412 --> 22:26.513
My ex-husband?

22:26.613 --> 22:28.381
He's putting you
in a bad spot.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.282
He's mixed up with the wrong
kind of people

22:30.383 --> 22:32.351
and if it gets out
during the campaign,

22:32.452 --> 22:33.553
it's gonna burn you.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.254
Anthony,
you need to listen to me.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.324
My personal life
is my personal life.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.560
No, it isn't.
The second you file

22:40.660 --> 22:42.261
and make this
whole thing official,

22:42.361 --> 22:44.263
your personal life is over.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.666
Okay.
I want you to leave, okay?

22:46.766 --> 22:48.935
You're this bent out of shape
when it's just me.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.503
What are you gonna be like

22:50.603 --> 22:51.704
when it's the press
or your opposition?

22:51.804 --> 22:53.606
Go. Now.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.008
Fine.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.310
But you should know...

22:58.411 --> 23:00.813
who you're getting
into bed with.

23:14.293 --> 23:16.863
I'm probably not supposed to
talk to you about this, but...

23:16.963 --> 23:19.866
that guy you mentioned,
Malcolm Argus...

23:19.966 --> 23:21.200
Yeah, Eddie...

23:21.300 --> 23:23.302
Just let me...

23:23.402 --> 23:24.571
You see, the reason

23:24.671 --> 23:25.905
I said I didn't think
I knew him

23:26.005 --> 23:27.607
is 'cause I didn't
recognize his face.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.275
Mm-hmm.
But his name rang a bell.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.577
Rang a bell?

23:30.677 --> 23:32.579
Not to me, but I've heard it
come up a bunch.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.881
With Badillo. Yes.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.382
Well, what've you heard?

23:36.483 --> 23:38.651
Nothing much.
Just that he loves the guy.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.587
Badillo loves him?
Not really.

23:40.687 --> 23:44.591
You know, just jokes 'cause
he's collared him so many times.

23:44.691 --> 23:48.628
Badillo has collared
Malcolm Argus?
Like five times.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.730
Says it's good
for his arrest numbers.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.132
The gift that
keeps on giving.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.701
What?
Nothing.

23:54.801 --> 23:55.935
No reason.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.604
Thank you.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.694
Hello, everyone.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.330
My name is Detective Reagan,

24:24.430 --> 24:25.865
this is my part--

24:27.700 --> 24:30.937
This is my partner,
Detective Maria Baez.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.675
Uh, yeah, I'm looking
for this man.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.578
I believe you all
know him as Sonny.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.415
Was wondering if anyone
could help me find him.

24:50.456 --> 24:51.524
Anyway.

24:51.624 --> 24:52.959
If anyone happens to see him,

24:53.059 --> 24:53.993
I will leave my card.

24:54.093 --> 24:56.696
Please give me a call.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.030
Thanks.

24:58.130 --> 25:02.034
Oh, by the way,
the officers down there...

25:02.134 --> 25:03.536
if you just take a look,

25:03.636 --> 25:05.572
uh, well, they'll be coming
up here to shut you down

25:05.672 --> 25:08.407
until such time as Sonny
is delivered to me.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.609
Have a great day.

25:12.579 --> 25:13.846
You have to go.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.448
Everyone.

25:16.549 --> 25:17.817
You have to clear out.
Right now.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.587
A little friendly persuasion.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.664
So sorry to
keep you waiting.

25:31.764 --> 25:34.667
I'm used to it.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.943
The CCRB ruled in your favor. Congratulations.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.344
Yeah, big whoop.

25:45.444 --> 25:48.314
You seem like a guy
who takes the win.

25:48.414 --> 25:49.982
Civilian Complaint
Review Board?

25:50.082 --> 25:52.351
No board starts with
"civilian" has any teeth.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.121
Which you factored for when
playing me and this issue.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.522
I never played you.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.024
No, of course not.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.326
That would be unbecoming
of an officer or something.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.528
Technically,
I'm a civilian employee.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.964
Yes, technically,
my employee.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.699
But we've seen
how much that matters.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.400
Mr. Mayor...

26:08.500 --> 26:13.806
sometimes I get the feeling
that you think I don't like you.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.608
Really?
I wonder why.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.476
Well, that's not
the case at all.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.411
But we are church and state.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.380
Separate but equal?

26:21.480 --> 26:24.350
Well, equal-ish.

26:24.450 --> 26:25.652
Huh.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.553
I guess that makes me
the mayor-ish.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.623
Well, we both have
the same goals

26:30.723 --> 26:33.259
even if our methods
diverge at times.

26:33.359 --> 26:36.428
All the time.
Not this time.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.800
Are you saying you're gonna
accept the CCRB's recommendation

26:40.900 --> 26:42.702
and terminate Officer Stokes?

26:43.469 --> 26:44.470
Ish.

26:44.570 --> 26:45.972
Ish?
Well, termination

26:46.072 --> 26:48.641
opens up a whole can of worms
with the union,

26:48.741 --> 26:50.309
and believe me,
you don't want any part of that.

26:50.409 --> 26:51.678
Then, what?

26:51.778 --> 26:54.113
I'm going to respect
the spirit of the ruling

26:54.213 --> 26:57.516
and suspend Officer Stokes
for 30 days without pay

26:57.616 --> 27:00.687
and one year of
dismissal probation.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.155
Mm.

27:03.255 --> 27:06.192
So, that whole opera about
what the cops go through

27:06.292 --> 27:07.794
and what's good for them
should be good for me

27:07.894 --> 27:10.897
and all that was what?
Posturing?

27:10.997 --> 27:13.099
I don't posture.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.734
Then, what?

27:14.834 --> 27:16.635
Before we ever
discussed the matter,

27:16.736 --> 27:18.337
I met with Officer Stokes.

27:18.437 --> 27:22.441
And everything I said to you was
a version of what he said to me.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.810
But you didn't agree with him?

27:23.910 --> 27:27.213
Uh, part of me
agreed with him fully.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.382
But the problem is
his position and actions

27:30.482 --> 27:32.318
broke my golden rule.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.620
You have an actual golden rule?

27:34.721 --> 27:37.356
I do. You can borrow it
if you want.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.391
Well, maybe I will.
What is it?

27:39.491 --> 27:42.161
Two wrongs don't make a right.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.270
I know.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.705
Hey, Reagan.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.941
Delivery is here.
I didn't order anything.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.675
You order dinner?
Nope.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.877
We didn't order dinner.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.678
It's not food.
It's a guy.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.781
Hey, partner.
Bring him in.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.255
Special delivery.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.657
Now that's a present.

28:11.758 --> 28:14.593
Nothing like
a little motivation.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.270
Hi.
Hi.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.109
Uh, I think that
you are going to be

28:30.209 --> 28:32.611
pretty excited about
the special tonight...

28:32.711 --> 28:35.314
Lobster bisque.
Your favorite.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.217
I'm not sure I can
stay for dinner.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.652
Uh-oh.
What'd I do now?

28:40.753 --> 28:42.254
You did nothing.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.656
It's-it's not your fault,
it's mine.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.158
Oh, my God.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.727
The dreaded "It's not you,
it's me" speech?

28:48.828 --> 28:50.763
That's ten times worse.

28:50.863 --> 28:51.898
What are you doing?

28:51.998 --> 28:55.467
It's... just
bad timing, Jack.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.969
When you're running
out of time,

28:57.069 --> 28:59.772
there's no such thing
as the right time.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.507
You're not
running out of time.

29:01.607 --> 29:03.709
We both are.

29:03.810 --> 29:06.913
Neither one of us
has their whole life

29:07.013 --> 29:09.248
ahead of them
like we once did.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.617
We got...

29:11.717 --> 29:14.854
half a life
ahead of us, at best.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.023
Let's make
the most of it.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.366
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

29:27.466 --> 29:28.434
Nope.

29:28.534 --> 29:29.601
What paper is running it?

29:29.701 --> 29:31.037
None.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.239
What do you mean? How did,
how'd you shut them down?

29:33.339 --> 29:34.440
I didn't.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.876
Erin, I'm sorry,
what-what is going on?

29:36.976 --> 29:40.179
My friend Anthony
shot this.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.647
He's following you?

29:41.747 --> 29:44.016
Not me. You.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.551
Me?

29:45.651 --> 29:47.186
Why the hell is
he following me?

29:47.286 --> 29:49.755
He thinks you're gonna
blow up my campaign.

29:49.856 --> 29:52.158
And as much as
I don't want to admit it,

29:52.258 --> 29:53.425
I think he's right.

29:53.525 --> 29:54.827
Slow down.
What...?

29:54.927 --> 29:57.063
What in the world
are you talking about?

29:57.163 --> 30:00.099
How could I possibly
blow up your campaign?

30:01.868 --> 30:04.570
Well, if that photo didn't,

30:04.670 --> 30:07.273
these certainly will.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.081
Erin, this is New York.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.016
Everybody rubs
shoulders together.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.986
Not when that shoulder
belongs to the ex-husband,

30:20.086 --> 30:22.288
secret boyfriend to
the long-shot daughter

30:22.388 --> 30:25.357
of the police commissioner
running for district attorney.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.995
Erin, come on.

30:29.095 --> 30:32.932
We are not gonna get too many
more cracks at this.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.837
I'm sorry, Jack.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.421
You sure you don't
want a lawyer?

30:55.521 --> 30:56.956
Spoke to him
before I came here.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.158
He told me not to worry
about a thing.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.559
Not to worry
about a thing, huh?

31:00.659 --> 31:03.029
I'd say felony assault
and escaping police custody

31:03.129 --> 31:04.363
is a lot to worry about.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.765
He says I'm not on
the hook for the escape.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.100
I didn't plan it.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.668
I just got caught up in it.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.471
Technically,
I was kidnapped.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.840
That's cute.
And probably true.

31:14.941 --> 31:17.043
It's not gonna help you
with the assault.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.911
Depends.
On what?

31:19.011 --> 31:20.312
How it plays in the press.

31:20.412 --> 31:23.015
Oh, that's his plan?
Take it to the press?

31:23.115 --> 31:26.452
Local Vietnamese kid
protecting neighborhood girls

31:26.552 --> 31:28.487
from a psycho white guy

31:28.587 --> 31:30.156
committing hate crimes
in Little Vietnam.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.960
I think that will play.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.064
So, why don't you
just drop the charges?

31:38.164 --> 31:40.566
'Cause it doesn't work that way.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.101
He thought you might
go for it.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.536
I told him you were too
butt-hurt to consider it.

31:44.636 --> 31:47.206
You know, Sonny,
I would say disappointed

31:47.306 --> 31:49.375
is probably
a more accurate term.

31:49.475 --> 31:54.280
Look, I appreciate you
looking out for me,

31:54.380 --> 31:55.714
believing in me.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.783
I took what you said to heart,

31:57.883 --> 31:59.585
I really did.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.420
But I had to do it my way.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.489
Right.
By becoming a vigilante?

32:03.589 --> 32:06.558
I'm not doing bad.
I'm doing good.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.327
Isn't that what you wanted?

32:08.427 --> 32:12.031
Yes, it's what I hoped for
for you, Sonny.

32:12.131 --> 32:15.467
Okay? But nobody gets
to be cop, judge and jury.

32:15.567 --> 32:18.770
What if you were
wrong about Sam Isaac?

32:18.870 --> 32:19.938
I wasn't.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.707
What if you were?

32:21.807 --> 32:23.575
What if you got the wrong guy?

32:23.675 --> 32:25.744
What if you killed
the guy you beat up?

32:25.844 --> 32:29.581
You saw the case I sent you.
I'm thorough, man.

32:29.681 --> 32:32.384
The case was thorough.
You did a good job.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.653
So, what do you say
you look the other way?

32:34.753 --> 32:36.522
I can't.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.824
'Cause I also saw the video.

32:42.928 --> 32:46.098
But look, maybe there's
something else I can do for you.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.699
What's that?

32:48.667 --> 32:50.802
Let me introduce you

32:50.902 --> 32:54.873
to Special Agent
Tommy Wong with the FBI.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.844
He's working a joint task force

32:58.944 --> 33:01.813
to eliminate human trafficking
in Little Vietnam.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.449
I think you two
can help each other.

33:03.549 --> 33:04.716
Help each other how?

33:04.816 --> 33:06.818
You work undercover for me,

33:06.918 --> 33:09.255
maybe the Feds can make
these charges

33:09.355 --> 33:10.622
with the state disappear.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.491
And who knows?

33:12.591 --> 33:15.961
Maybe Tommy can succeed
where I failed,

33:16.062 --> 33:18.764
and help you
find a new career path.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.973
All right, Sonny.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.843
Let's talk about
how we can get started, huh?

33:35.681 --> 33:37.015
I'm all ears.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.788
What am I looking at?

33:42.888 --> 33:44.556
Malcolm Argus's phone records.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.092
How'd you get these?

33:46.192 --> 33:47.893
What he said up on the wire
was enough for the judge.

33:47.993 --> 33:49.661
Nice play. And...?

33:49.761 --> 33:52.964
Take a look at these
highlighted calls.

33:53.965 --> 33:55.201
Our cop?

33:55.301 --> 33:56.568
That number comes back
to Officer Badillo.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.338
So it's him.
Badillo is the dirty cop.

33:59.438 --> 34:00.506
No, boss.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.274
What do you mean no?

34:02.374 --> 34:05.477
These are outgoing calls.
From Argus to Badillo.
So?

34:05.577 --> 34:07.079
Take a look at the length
of these calls.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.715
Each one of them no more
than a few seconds long.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.783
Yeah, I don't get
where you're going with this.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.952
Argus knew he was up on a wire.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.655
That's why he was so obvious
when he talked about

34:16.755 --> 34:18.056
a cop being in his pocket

34:18.157 --> 34:19.758
and why he made
multiple calls to Badillo,

34:19.858 --> 34:22.027
but not once had an actual
conversation with him.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.496
Why the hell would Argus
go through all this trouble

34:24.596 --> 34:26.064
to sell Badillo
as a dirty cop?

34:26.165 --> 34:29.401
Because Badillo has collared
Argus five times

34:29.501 --> 34:30.769
in the last year.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.539
And another two times
in years previous.

34:33.639 --> 34:36.475
So that's his play.

34:36.575 --> 34:40.546
He puts the finger on Badillo.
Hopes we start an investigation.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.448
Figures at the very least,

34:42.548 --> 34:44.250
Badillo gets transferred
to another precinct.

34:44.350 --> 34:47.219
Either way, Argus pulls
the thorn from his side.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.689
Guess I was right
about you, Reagan.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.460
You belong here.

34:55.361 --> 34:58.564
Good work. Boss.

35:06.238 --> 35:07.539
Your office called.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.676
Said you needed these.
Thank you, Anthony.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.546
So, this is
where we're at now?

35:14.646 --> 35:17.149
Your office calls me,
not you?

35:17.249 --> 35:18.884
It doesn't mean anything.

35:18.984 --> 35:22.087
Really? So, something that's
never happened before

35:22.188 --> 35:23.489
has happened
three times this week

35:23.589 --> 35:25.324
but it doesn't
mean anything?

35:25.424 --> 35:26.692
Okay.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.960
Hold on, Anthony.

35:32.298 --> 35:35.567
I don't like that you were
following me without me knowing.

35:35.667 --> 35:36.968
I know.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.405
But understand, I was just
looking out for you.

35:39.505 --> 35:40.906
That's what friends do.

35:41.006 --> 35:43.809
Okay, but sometimes
it's just a little too much.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.044
Oh, so, you mean
I'm a little too much?

35:46.144 --> 35:47.746
No...

35:47.846 --> 35:49.881
You know, the thing with me?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.983
I don't let anybody in. Nobody.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.753
So when I do, it's a big deal.

35:56.522 --> 35:59.425
I'm an all or nothing guy.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.928
And sometimes all of me
is too much for people.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.264
No, it...
No, it's true.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.267
I could've gone about this
whole thing a little better.

36:08.367 --> 36:11.603
Well, the deck was
stacked against you.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.873
I mean, if you had come clean
about sniffing around Jack,

36:14.973 --> 36:18.009
I would've been pissed
and shut you down hard.

36:18.109 --> 36:19.211
You think?

36:19.311 --> 36:20.712
And then I would've
continued seeing Jack

36:20.812 --> 36:22.748
which means it would be
<i>The Post</i> who had

36:22.848 --> 36:24.850
those photos...
instead of you.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.253
I would rather you hate me
than for that to have happened.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.788
The last thing in the world
I would do is hate you.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.423
Just tone it down, right?

36:31.523 --> 36:32.691
No...

36:32.791 --> 36:34.860
Yeah, but... Look...

36:35.761 --> 36:38.297
I suck at some things
and you suck at others,

36:38.397 --> 36:41.767
but for the most part,
together, we don't suck.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.835
We're pretty great.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.505
I love it.
Our new motto.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.173
"We don't suck."

36:50.742 --> 36:51.843
Behind us?

36:51.943 --> 36:53.679
Rearview mirror, baby.

36:59.117 --> 37:00.386
See you later.

37:00.486 --> 37:02.120
See you.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.694
The mayor just wrapped
his press conference.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.195
Damn, I missed it.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.398
Took most of the credit
for downgrading

37:12.498 --> 37:14.600
from termination to suspension.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.868
Came off as perfectly reasonable,

37:16.968 --> 37:18.870
even gracious to our cops.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.008
Nothing wrong with that.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.177
The outcome you expected?

37:27.178 --> 37:29.515
I don't know.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.318
Come on, you were three steps
ahead on this the whole time.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.953
Well, you plan
for the best outcome,

37:35.053 --> 37:37.055
but you prepare for the worst.

37:37.155 --> 37:38.557
Hmm.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.659
Got to hand it to you.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.761
Works almost every time.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.130
But?

37:46.932 --> 37:48.967
Just curious...

37:49.067 --> 37:53.605
why is it necessary
to keep me in the dark?

37:53.705 --> 37:55.441
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

37:55.541 --> 37:57.075
Why not?
That's what it is.

37:57.175 --> 37:59.110
Well, you know
that guy in the bar

37:59.210 --> 38:01.880
that's always bragging about
the big deal he's gonna close

38:01.980 --> 38:04.616
or the brilliant way
he's gonna tell his boss off?

38:04.716 --> 38:06.652
He gets his validation,

38:06.752 --> 38:08.720
right there, on the spot.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.589
But he hasn't really
ever done anything

38:10.689 --> 38:12.324
except bend his elbow.

38:12.424 --> 38:13.992
I hear that.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.661
Talk about what
you want too much,

38:15.761 --> 38:17.729
you're less likely
to get it.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.265
But I'm not
your drinking buddy.

38:21.166 --> 38:23.068
Well, some of the time.

38:25.671 --> 38:28.073
I'm supposed to be
your right hand.

38:28.173 --> 38:30.041
And you are.

38:36.114 --> 38:39.818
Is it me,
the office I hold, what?

38:40.652 --> 38:41.553
Is <i>what</i> what?

38:41.653 --> 38:43.822
Well...

38:45.357 --> 38:50.161
I get the feeling pushback
has become your default reaction

38:50.261 --> 38:52.898
to a lot of what I say and do.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.300
Well, when the right hand
doesn't know

38:55.401 --> 38:56.868
what the left hand
is doing...

38:56.968 --> 38:59.705
Well, it's still part
of the same body.

39:03.008 --> 39:08.046
Your door has "Deputy
Commissioner" stenciled on it.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.716
Do we want to change it
to "devil's advocate"?

39:10.816 --> 39:12.951
No.
Garrett,

39:13.051 --> 39:17.322
sometimes you being in the dark
is part of the play.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.125
But we're still
on the same team.

39:20.225 --> 39:21.993
But if I'm gonna be
in a fight,

39:22.093 --> 39:23.629
I want to know
it's for real.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.063
It was real. No.

39:25.163 --> 39:26.798
You were treading water
until the mayor got

39:26.898 --> 39:28.434
where you wanted him to be.

39:28.534 --> 39:34.105
And along the way I needed
our fight to hone my position.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.308
Whether I knew it or not.

39:39.310 --> 39:43.381
It's an old cliché,
but in our case...

39:43.482 --> 39:45.784
the honest-to-God truth.

39:45.884 --> 39:51.089
I can't do it--
any of it-- without you.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.029
Thank you.

40:14.212 --> 40:15.447
Okay, Danny.

40:15.547 --> 40:17.916
What's the dumbest thing
you've ever done?

40:18.016 --> 40:19.585
Agreeing to play
this stupid game.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.054
Ah, come on, Danny.
Real answer.

40:23.154 --> 40:24.856
Dumbest thing I've ever done:

40:24.956 --> 40:27.225
giving my blessing
to the unholy union

40:27.325 --> 40:28.827
between you and my brother.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.896
Oh, shots fired.

40:30.996 --> 40:32.664
Not you. Him. Oh.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.100
Sean,
what's your greatest fear?

40:35.200 --> 40:37.569
Oof, uh, disappointing
my father.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.838
Oh...

40:39.938 --> 40:41.306
It's true.
I want to make you proud.

40:41.406 --> 40:44.042
You always make me proud.
And you never disappoint me.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.877
Yeah, please try to
remember that

40:45.977 --> 40:47.378
next time you bust me
for something.

40:47.479 --> 40:48.680
Anger and disappointment

40:48.780 --> 40:50.048
are not the same thing.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.850
What's your life's
greatest loss?

40:51.950 --> 40:53.752
Let's go, Mets.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.688
Oh, still going on about
those Mets, huh?

40:56.788 --> 40:57.989
I will never get over it.

40:58.089 --> 41:00.458
You can't win 101 games

41:00.559 --> 41:03.061
and then get eliminated
in the first round.

41:03.161 --> 41:04.029
Next year, Pop.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.864
Eddie.
Yes.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.700
What is your fondest memory?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.168
Marrying this guy.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.803
Aw...

41:11.903 --> 41:13.071
Okay.

41:13.171 --> 41:16.007
Ooh, when were you
the most scared?

41:16.107 --> 41:18.376
Uh, when I proposed to you.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.145
Seriously?
Yeah.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.047
Erin gave me
ten-to-one odds.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.282
She is the best handicapper
in the family.

41:24.382 --> 41:25.917
Well, I call 'em like I see 'em.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.253
To Dad. Dad?
Yeah.

41:28.353 --> 41:30.722
What's your life's
greatest blessing?

41:30.822 --> 41:33.959
Well, this delicious Sunday.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.727
What?
What?

41:35.827 --> 41:37.095
Not this sundae,

41:37.195 --> 41:39.030
this Sunday.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.866
And every Sunday

41:40.966 --> 41:42.534
I get to spend
with you knuckleheads.

41:42.634 --> 41:43.569
Dad.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.403
That's nice.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.005
Ooh.

41:48.273 --> 41:49.307
Uh-oh.

41:49.407 --> 41:51.777
Who is the love
of your life?

41:51.877 --> 41:53.579
It doesn't say that.

41:53.679 --> 41:54.913
Sure does.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.014
Ooh...

41:56.114 --> 41:57.248
Okay, well...

41:57.348 --> 41:58.884
How about those Mets, Pop?

41:58.984 --> 42:00.151
No stalling.
You got to answer that.

42:00.251 --> 42:01.587
Yeah, you have to
tell us.

42:01.687 --> 42:03.354
Come on. Okay.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.190
Well, I'm gonna take
the Fifth and the box.

42:05.290 --> 42:06.424
How about that?

42:06.524 --> 42:07.458
Game over.

42:07.559 --> 42:09.027
Wow.
Whoa.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.399
A sore loser.
