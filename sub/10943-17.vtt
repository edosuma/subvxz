to Nashville

Now, I didn't come all the way
to Moose Jaw

04:03.365 --> 04:06.099
to cause problems for you.

04:06.167 --> 04:08.502
Ever since you showed up
at my door last spring,

04:08.570 --> 04:11.704
I've had nothing
but problems,

04:11.772 --> 04:14.073
and I have the legal bills
to prove it.

04:14.141 --> 04:15.408
I have no intention

04:15.476 --> 04:17.610
of coming between you
and your son.

04:17.678 --> 04:19.379
But Shane's not gonna be
a boy forever

04:19.446 --> 04:21.846
and you're only gonna be able
to keep him away from Tim

04:21.915 --> 04:23.115
for so long.

04:24.050 --> 04:25.117
Is that a threat?

04:25.185 --> 04:27.185
No, that's a fact.

04:27.253 --> 04:28.219
When Shane gets older,

04:28.354 --> 04:29.755
if he wants
to find his father,

04:29.822 --> 04:31.490
he will.

04:31.557 --> 04:32.557
But by then,
I'm afraid,

04:32.625 --> 04:34.793
there won't be a father
to find.

04:34.860 --> 04:37.296
Not the one he remembers
anyway.

04:37.363 --> 04:39.264
What are you saying?

04:40.232 --> 04:42.700
We have something in common,
you and me.

04:42.768 --> 04:44.835
We both knew
the old Tim;

04:44.903 --> 04:46.337
The one I kicked out
of the house.

04:46.405 --> 04:48.472
The same guy you met
in Fort St. John.

04:50.609 --> 04:51.676
(Huffs)

04:52.711 --> 04:54.612
He's off the wagon,
isn't he?

04:54.680 --> 04:55.946
I'm sorry to say.

04:57.549 --> 04:59.882
So what?
Why should I care?

04:59.950 --> 05:01.685
Well, because if things
get any worse,

05:01.752 --> 05:04.387
your son's gonna have
a broken-down drunk for a dad,

05:04.455 --> 05:06.723
and no amount of lawyers
or courtroom battles

05:06.791 --> 05:08.758
are gonna protect him
from that kind of heartbreak,

05:08.826 --> 05:10.993
and you know that.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.230
What is it you want me
to do, Jack?

05:32.514 --> 05:33.748
Oh, nothing.

05:35.384 --> 05:38.486
I thought I'd just prepare
a little something for lunch.

05:38.554 --> 05:39.821
Is that a quiche?

05:39.888 --> 05:41.288
Quiche Lorraine
to be exact.

05:41.357 --> 05:43.858
Wow.
What's the occasion?

05:43.925 --> 05:45.025
No occasion.

05:45.093 --> 05:46.393
You're a hard-working mother

05:46.461 --> 05:48.395
in the middle
of a highly stressful move,

05:48.463 --> 05:51.365
and your equally busy husband
is away on a business trip.

05:51.432 --> 05:52.532
You barely have time
to breathe,

05:52.600 --> 05:55.001
let alone prepare
a healthy meal.

05:55.069 --> 05:58.739
So sit down
and enjoy.

05:58.806 --> 06:00.206
Thank you.

06:00.274 --> 06:02.208
And don't forget
to leave room for dessert.

06:02.276 --> 06:04.977
I made a creme brulee

06:10.316 --> 06:11.417
"Secret recipes."

06:11.485 --> 06:13.318
Clearly, a well-kept
secret.

06:13.387 --> 06:14.553
Bon appetit!

06:14.621 --> 06:16.455
Wow, Mallory,
this looks amazing.

06:16.523 --> 06:18.156
Thank you.

06:18.224 --> 06:19.357
Are you going to join me?

06:19.425 --> 06:20.859
No, thank you.

06:20.926 --> 06:23.294
I think I'm gonna get
a head start on the laundry,

06:23.362 --> 06:25.930
and then after that
there's silverware

06:25.998 --> 06:26.898
that should be
polished.

06:26.965 --> 06:28.533
No, there isn't.

06:28.601 --> 06:31.035
Oh, then I'll just
iron the bedsheets.

06:31.103 --> 06:33.170
Okay, Mallory,
what's going on?

06:33.238 --> 06:34.205
Nothing.

06:34.273 --> 06:35.372
This is just an example

06:35.440 --> 06:36.473
of what your life
could be like

06:36.541 --> 06:38.575
with a live-in
domestic engineer.

06:38.643 --> 06:39.810
Mallory...

06:39.878 --> 06:40.977
You won't even
have to pay me.

06:41.045 --> 06:42.479
I'll work for room
and board.

06:42.547 --> 06:43.747
And think about all the money
you'll save on daycare.

06:43.815 --> 06:44.648
What about school?

06:44.716 --> 06:45.616
I'll multi-task.

06:45.683 --> 06:46.517
What about your parents?

06:46.584 --> 06:49.185
I'll get... emancipated.

06:49.253 --> 06:50.887
(Sighs) Believe me,

06:50.954 --> 06:53.456
I wish you didn't
have to move away, Mallory.

06:53.524 --> 06:54.891
I'm gonna miss you
like crazy,

06:54.958 --> 06:56.926
and so is Katie.

06:56.993 --> 06:59.829
But I don't think this is
a very realistic solution.

06:59.897 --> 07:03.098
I know.
It was worth a shot.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.000
I guess I'm back
to Plan A:

07:05.068 --> 07:07.736
Saving up money for rent
for an apartment.

07:07.804 --> 07:10.138
And how exactly
are you going to do that?

07:10.205 --> 07:12.641
I'm gonna charge you
$75 dollars for the quiche.

07:12.708 --> 07:14.008
Yeah,
I don't think so.

07:14.076 --> 07:15.310
But I'll pay you
twenty bucks

07:15.377 --> 07:17.145
to help me move my junk
out of the Quonset hut.

07:17.212 --> 07:18.246
Done.

07:19.449 --> 07:21.817
(Hamster squeaks,

07:21.884 --> 07:23.317

Perfect!
I am starving.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.086
Thank you.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.488
What're you working on?

07:27.556 --> 07:29.957
Uh, just my vet school
applications.

07:30.024 --> 07:32.726
I thought you sent
those in days ago.

07:32.794 --> 07:34.862
I was going to,
but uh...

07:34.930 --> 07:36.597
But...?

07:36.665 --> 07:37.865
This guy in
my genetics class

07:37.933 --> 07:39.999
is bragging about
all of his academic awards.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.267
So?

07:41.335 --> 07:43.035
So I don't have
any academic awards.

07:43.103 --> 07:44.337
Yes, but Ty,

07:44.404 --> 07:46.339
you have tons
of work experience.

07:46.406 --> 07:47.907
Yeah, and so does the guy
in my genetics class,

07:47.975 --> 07:49.375
and this is his third time
applying.

07:49.443 --> 07:50.877
But he's not you.

07:52.412 --> 07:53.480

but that's not enough
to get into vet school.

08:01.654 --> 08:03.555

of time and money?

08:03.623 --> 08:05.190

What, you're not gonna
eat with me?

08:13.499 --> 08:14.765
Lobo ran away
this morning,

08:14.833 --> 08:16.200
so I'm gonna take Spartan out
to look for him.

08:16.267 --> 08:17.301
Are you sure?

08:17.369 --> 08:18.202
I was gonna let you
feed Lady Gouda

08:18.269 --> 08:20.137
some sesame seeds.

Mallory.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.594
I'm selling all of this
stuff online.

08:45.662 --> 08:47.530
Mallory: Seriously?
Who is gonna buy this junk?

08:47.597 --> 08:48.964
Are you kidding me?

08:49.032 --> 08:50.666
There is always someone
looking for a deal.

08:50.734 --> 08:52.300
Last week I made
three hundred bucks

08:52.368 --> 08:54.336
selling Peter's old
bachelor furniture.

08:54.404 --> 08:55.370
Three hundred bucks?

08:55.438 --> 08:56.605
Mm-hmm!

08:56.673 --> 08:57.773
And every penny's
going right back

08:57.841 --> 08:59.841
into renovating
our new house.

08:59.909 --> 09:01.375
Lou, you're a genius!

09:01.443 --> 09:04.045
Well,
I wouldn't say genius.

09:04.112 --> 09:05.413
But did I ever tell you

09:05.480 --> 09:07.582
that I was hired by
Strickland and Cook

09:07.650 --> 09:10.117
even before I graduated
from college?

09:10.185 --> 09:13.320
And everyone knows I would've
been high school Valedictorian,

09:13.388 --> 09:15.255
if it wasn't for
Mary Jane Stupka

09:15.322 --> 09:17.024
and her stupid GPA,

09:17.091 --> 09:18.458
which was one percent
higher than mine.

09:18.526 --> 09:21.161
I mean, seriously,
one percent.

09:22.597 --> 09:23.630
Mallory?!

09:24.998 --> 09:27.367
I want my twenty bucks back!

09:41.013 --> 09:42.347
<i>Tim:</i> <i>All right, all
right,</i> <i>I'm here.</i>

09:42.415 --> 09:43.915
<i>What's so damn important</i>
<i>you had to bring me all-</i>

09:43.983 --> 09:45.517
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Just come in
here</i> <i>and sit down.</i>

09:45.585 --> 09:46.751
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Just tell me</i>
<i>what's going on, Ja-!</i>

09:46.819 --> 09:48.720
Hello, Tim.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.722
Tim:
What're you doing here?

09:51.657 --> 09:53.192
Where's Shane?

09:53.259 --> 09:54.993
Staying with a friend.

09:55.061 --> 09:57.128
I asked Miranda
to come here, Tim.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.330
What're you even
involved for?

09:59.398 --> 10:00.798
I got a lawyer
for a reason.

10:00.865 --> 10:01.832
I don't know
that your lawyer's

10:01.900 --> 10:04.001
acting in your best
interest.

10:04.069 --> 10:06.537
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Well, it's none of
your</i> <i>business, old man.</i>

10:06.605 --> 10:07.738
What did he tell you?

10:07.806 --> 10:09.640
That you need help.

10:09.708 --> 10:13.042
Well, you can go to hell,
and you can go to hell.

10:13.111 --> 10:15.011
'Cause whatever
he told you is a lie.

10:15.079 --> 10:16.646
I know he's telling
the truth,

10:16.714 --> 10:18.315
because the man
I'm looking at right now,

10:18.382 --> 10:20.550
reminds me a lot of the man
I dumped in Fort St. John.

10:20.618 --> 10:22.586
I don't need this crap.

10:30.494 --> 10:32.861
I shouldn't have come.

10:38.001 --> 10:40.469
(Bottle cap
screws into place)

10:49.778 --> 10:53.114
I'm getting tired
of you, Jack.

10:53.182 --> 10:55.383
Give it a rest,
huh?

10:56.952 --> 10:58.919
My lawyer is this close

10:58.987 --> 11:00.687
to getting custody
of that kid.

11:00.755 --> 11:03.957
You must be really drunk,
if you believe that.

11:04.025 --> 11:05.259
Keep this up,

11:05.326 --> 11:06.493
and not only are you
gonna lose Shane,

11:06.561 --> 11:10.197
you're gonna lose
your daughters too.

11:11.866 --> 11:15.469
Miranda is good enough
to come here.

11:15.537 --> 11:18.037
Don't mess this up,
Tim.

11:26.813 --> 11:27.813
Lobo!

11:30.884 --> 11:31.950
Lobo?!

11:35.988 --> 11:37.522
(Whistles)

11:37.590 --> 11:38.623
Lobo!

11:43.229 --> 11:44.762
(Birds chirp)

11:44.830 --> 11:46.898
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Hey! There you are!
</i> <i>(Lobo whines)</i>

11:49.536 --> 11:50.403
Lobo!

11:50.470 --> 11:51.504
(Lobo whines and pants)

11:52.139 --> 11:54.108
Where have you been,
huh?

11:55.176 --> 11:57.177
What're you doing?

11:58.445 --> 11:59.179
(Lobo whines)

12:03.550 --> 12:04.549
Okay...

12:06.319 --> 12:07.252
What happened?

12:07.320 --> 12:08.187
(Lobo whines)

12:10.586 --> 12:12.687
<i>(Lobo whines)</i>

12:15.090 --> 12:16.157
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>It's a bullet wound.</i>

12:16.225 --> 12:17.824
What?

12:17.892 --> 12:18.825
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Yeah, you can see</i>
<i>the entrance wound</i>

12:18.893 --> 12:20.093
on the other side
of his chest,

12:20.161 --> 12:21.595
and here's where
it exited.

12:21.663 --> 12:22.829
Oh my God...

12:22.897 --> 12:24.331
Who would do
something like that?

12:24.399 --> 12:26.166
Ty: Some rancher probably
thought he was a wolf.

12:26.234 --> 12:27.668
You know how trigger happy
they get

12:27.735 --> 12:29.469
when they're trying
to protect their livestock.

12:29.537 --> 12:30.537
Well, he's got
a good heartbeat,

12:30.605 --> 12:32.105
that's good.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.540
The bullet went in high enough
that it missed his heart.

12:34.608 --> 12:36.075
He's a pretty lucky dog.

12:36.142 --> 12:37.176
So are you gonna
call Scott?

12:37.244 --> 12:38.344
He's out of town
for the weekend.

12:38.412 --> 12:40.346
Dr. Miller's filling in
for him.

12:40.414 --> 12:41.414
He just left
for the McKnight farm

12:41.481 --> 12:42.682
<i>a few hours ago.</i>

12:42.749 --> 12:44.283
<i>He should still be</i>
<i>in range.</i>

12:44.351 --> 12:45.951
<i>Dr. Miller, it's Ty.</i>
<i>I'm at the clinic.</i>

12:46.019 --> 12:47.386
We've got a bit
of an emergency here,

12:47.454 --> 12:48.421
<i>if you can call me back</i>
<i>when you get this?</i>

12:48.488 --> 12:49.655
<i>Thanks. Bye.</i>

12:49.723 --> 12:50.756
Amy:
So what do we do?

12:50.857 --> 12:51.957
We gotta take him

12:52.025 --> 12:53.959
to the emergency clinic
in Calgary.

12:54.027 --> 12:55.560
Ty, that's over
an hour away.

12:55.628 --> 12:58.563
I know, but everything else
is closed on Saturday.

12:58.631 --> 12:59.698
(Lobo whines)

12:59.766 --> 13:02.167
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

13:02.235 --> 13:03.468
I'm gonna staple up
the wounds -

13:03.536 --> 13:05.204
I've seen Scott do it
a hundred times.

13:05.271 --> 13:06.403
If Dr. Miller doesn't
call me back

13:06.471 --> 13:08.005
by the time I'm done,

13:08.073 --> 13:09.640
at least he won't be bleeding
all the way to Calgary.

13:09.708 --> 13:10.942
What can I do?

13:11.009 --> 13:12.610
Clip the hair
around the wounds, okay?

13:12.677 --> 13:14.578
- Okay.
- Keep him calm.

13:15.580 --> 13:16.748
(Clippers buzz)

13:18.784 --> 13:20.151
Hey, Lou.

13:20.219 --> 13:21.352
Hey, stranger.

13:21.419 --> 13:22.518
Can I give you
a hand here?

13:22.586 --> 13:24.121
Here, why don't you
take Katie.

13:24.188 --> 13:25.822
Okay, I'd love to.

13:25.890 --> 13:27.958
Hello, sweetheart.
Hello.

13:28.025 --> 13:30.060
So where have you been?

13:30.128 --> 13:31.561
Your note was
very mysterious.

13:31.629 --> 13:34.497
Yeah, I'm sorry about
disappearing like that.

13:34.565 --> 13:37.767
I ended up driving out
to Moose Jaw.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.301
Moose Jaw?!

13:39.369 --> 13:41.137
Does this have something
to do with Miranda?

13:41.204 --> 13:44.106
Did you have fun shopping
for groceries with mommy?

13:44.174 --> 13:44.907
Grandpa?

13:47.410 --> 13:50.345
Yeah. Yeah, it has something
to do with Miranda.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.614
As a matter of fact,
she's in the house right now.

13:52.682 --> 13:54.783
What? Miranda is here?
Are you kidding-

13:54.817 --> 13:56.918
She might be staying overnight
at the dude ranch,

13:56.986 --> 13:58.953
if that's okay.

13:59.021 --> 14:01.656
Grandpa,
what is going on?

14:01.723 --> 14:05.126
Your dad is not dealing
with this custody situation

14:05.194 --> 14:06.394
all that well.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.530
Why don't you
give me that,

14:10.598 --> 14:12.499
and, come on, honey,
we'll go in the house.

14:12.566 --> 14:16.736
<i>And we'll read a book,</i>
<i>just you and me, okay?</i>

14:23.711 --> 14:25.478
Can you help me
with this?

14:25.546 --> 14:27.313
So this is why
you wanted a ride?

14:27.380 --> 14:28.848
What?

14:28.916 --> 14:30.049
I know you said you needed
to make money, Mallory,

14:30.117 --> 14:31.483
but busking? Really?

14:31.551 --> 14:33.319
I don't even know
how to play the guitar.

14:33.386 --> 14:34.653
This is gonna be
a disaster.

14:34.721 --> 14:36.555
Jake, I'm not busking!

14:36.623 --> 14:37.690
<i>So what's it for then?</i>

14:37.757 --> 14:38.757
I'll tell you
on the way.

14:38.826 --> 14:40.726
Well, where exactly
are we going?

14:40.794 --> 14:42.093
This is the address,
okay?

14:42.161 --> 14:43.494
But you might want
to step on it

14:43.562 --> 14:44.963
'cause I was supposed to be
there five minutes ago.

14:47.733 --> 14:48.900
You know, Miranda,

14:48.968 --> 14:52.070
I'm really glad
you came back here.

14:52.138 --> 14:54.439
Yeah, well,
Jack can be very persuasive.

14:54.506 --> 14:56.741
Can I ask you
a question?

14:56.809 --> 14:58.309
Of course.

14:58.376 --> 15:01.678
All those years ago,
back in Fort St. John,

15:01.746 --> 15:04.381
were you in love
with my dad?

15:05.317 --> 15:06.917
Oh, um...

15:07.886 --> 15:10.921
Well, you have a daughter,
so...

15:11.890 --> 15:13.557
You know what it's like
to be suddenly responsible

15:13.658 --> 15:15.992
for a tiny human being.

15:16.927 --> 15:20.163
Whether or not
I loved your dad,

15:20.231 --> 15:22.565
Shane became my world.

15:22.632 --> 15:26.402
And back then, your father,
well, he had some problems.

15:26.470 --> 15:28.171
He still does,

15:28.239 --> 15:30.038
and I still have
to protect my son.

15:31.007 --> 15:33.575
You make it sound like my dad's
some kind of a monster

15:33.642 --> 15:35.677
Shane needs to be
protected from.

15:35.745 --> 15:37.579
No, he's not a monster,

15:37.680 --> 15:40.882
but he's a different person
when he's drinking.

15:40.949 --> 15:42.083
Um, I'm sorry,
back up.

15:42.150 --> 15:45.319
Who said anything
about drinking?

15:53.728 --> 15:55.095
All right...

15:55.162 --> 15:57.030
Well,
that should do it.

15:57.098 --> 15:58.399
Okay,
let's get going.

15:58.466 --> 15:59.533
(Lobo whines)

16:01.269 --> 16:03.436
Wait...
Something's wrong.

16:03.938 --> 16:05.138
(Panting rapidly)

16:06.107 --> 16:07.240
What is it?

16:07.308 --> 16:09.075
His breathing,
it's not right.

16:09.110 --> 16:10.175
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>What's happening?</i>

16:10.210 --> 16:11.778
I'm not hearing
good lung sounds.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.812
There might be some air
in his chest cavity

16:12.880 --> 16:14.380
from the bullet wound.

16:14.448 --> 16:15.848
- That doesn't sound good.
- No it's not. Uhm...

16:15.916 --> 16:17.950
Here,
can you put this on him?

16:17.984 --> 16:19.051
<i>Amy:</i> <i>It's okay.</i>
<i>It's okay, Lobo.</i>

16:19.119 --> 16:20.386
<i>Good boy.</i>

16:20.454 --> 16:22.822
- Ready?
- Yeah... what's going on?

16:22.890 --> 16:24.223
<i>Ty</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

16:24.291 --> 16:25.357

Um...

16:27.226 --> 16:28.259
Ty?

16:28.327 --> 16:29.861
Just let me think ok?

<i>(Banging loudly)</i>
<i>Miranda!</i>

16:43.742 --> 16:46.510
(Door bangs shut)
I know why you're here.

16:46.578 --> 16:48.145
'Cause Jack gave you
some overblown story

16:48.212 --> 16:50.514
about how I've been
drinking again, right?

16:50.582 --> 16:52.583
So you came to see for yoursef
if I'm an unfit father?

16:52.651 --> 16:55.486
Well,
I hate to disappoint you,

16:55.554 --> 16:56.520
I'm fine.

16:56.588 --> 16:58.220
Really?
You didn't sound fine

16:58.288 --> 17:00.189
in that message
you left me last week.

17:00.257 --> 17:02.158
What message?

17:02.225 --> 17:05.161
You don't remember,
do you?

17:05.228 --> 17:06.829
God...
That's unbelievable.

17:06.896 --> 17:08.998
I knew this was
a bad idea.

17:09.066 --> 17:10.366
We're gonna leave this
to our lawyers.

17:10.434 --> 17:12.868
Look, Shane has not been
the same

17:12.936 --> 17:15.369
since he came back,
okay?

17:15.438 --> 17:19.107
He's angry,
he's getting into fights,

17:19.175 --> 17:20.675
and comes home late
from school

17:20.742 --> 17:24.346
and he doesn't wanna tell me
where he's been.

17:24.413 --> 17:26.781
He used to be
such a sweet boy,

17:26.849 --> 17:28.249
and now he's...

17:31.286 --> 17:32.653
He's what?

17:34.422 --> 17:36.190
I'm tired, Tim.

17:37.325 --> 17:39.560
I'm so tired
of fighting with you!

17:39.628 --> 17:42.262
I'm tired of fighting
with Shane!

17:42.330 --> 17:45.665
I'm...
I'm just so tired.

There you go.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.692
Mallory: Thanks.
Guy: Thanks.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.534
Check it out.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.170
Five thousand dollars
for a guitar?

18:26.238 --> 18:27.939
It was vintage
or something.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.207
Well, where'd you get it from?
Your dad?

18:30.275 --> 18:32.911
Yeah. I put it online
and then like an hour later

18:32.978 --> 18:34.477
some guy from the music store
emails me

18:34.546 --> 18:36.013
and offers me
five thousand big ones.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.848
You know what this means?

18:37.916 --> 18:40.417
It means that I can get
an apartment in Hudson!

18:40.484 --> 18:41.919
I don't have to move
to Nashville any more!

18:41.986 --> 18:43.386
Oh my gosh!

18:43.454 --> 18:45.622
Let's go pick out affordable
Swedish furniture!

18:45.690 --> 18:46.723
(Hedging sigh)

18:47.692 --> 18:49.259
What?

18:49.326 --> 18:51.794
Nothing, it was just...
Something about that guy.

18:51.862 --> 18:54.097
I don't know,
he seems kinda shifty.

18:54.165 --> 18:56.533
He works at the music store.
He's not shifty,

18:56.600 --> 18:58.401
he's, you know, cool.

18:58.469 --> 18:59.902
I don't know,
but...

18:59.970 --> 19:01.604
We should cash that cheque
before we do anything.

19:01.672 --> 19:03.306
Fine!
First, we go to the bank

19:03.374 --> 19:07.076
and then we go
to the furniture store.

19:17.420 --> 19:20.222
You should've told me
about dad,

19:20.290 --> 19:22.023
and you should've
told Amy.

19:22.091 --> 19:23.757
Yeah, I know.

19:23.825 --> 19:27.928
I guess I just didn't
wanna believe it myself.

19:27.996 --> 19:29.930
Yeah, well...

19:29.998 --> 19:32.567
The funny thing is,
I think I knew.

19:32.634 --> 19:34.335
I mean, all the signs
were there.

19:34.403 --> 19:36.571
Well, it's been a tough year
for your dad.

19:36.638 --> 19:37.938
So you're making excuses
for him?

19:38.006 --> 19:40.807
No! I'm not making excuses,
but...

19:41.875 --> 19:42.875
This whole Shane thing

19:42.943 --> 19:45.078
has turned his world
upside down.

19:45.146 --> 19:46.913
So you brought Miranda
here,

19:46.981 --> 19:48.515
what, to fix him?

19:48.583 --> 19:50.750
To show him
what he has to lose.

19:50.818 --> 19:52.219
Now, if they can work
things out,

19:52.286 --> 19:54.786
maybe your father will find
his own way out of this.

19:54.854 --> 19:56.888
And if they can't?

20:00.260 --> 20:02.661
Grandpa, I'm sorry,
but I am not gonna sit by

20:02.729 --> 20:05.264
and watch him tear
this family apart again.

20:06.899 --> 20:09.301
(Phone rings)

20:11.036 --> 20:13.204
(Phone beeps on)
Yeah. Hello.

20:13.272 --> 20:14.905
Wha...
Amy, slow down.

20:17.075 --> 20:19.110
Oh my God.
Is he okay?

20:19.178 --> 20:20.278
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>We don't know yet.</i>

20:20.346 --> 20:21.912
Lou,
I really gotta go.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.314
No, just stay there.

20:23.382 --> 20:25.883
We'll call you
if we need anything, okay?

20:25.951 --> 20:26.983
Bye.

20:30.888 --> 20:32.956
His lungs are collapsed.

20:34.292 --> 20:36.226
So we keep him
on oxygen?

20:36.294 --> 20:37.861
Uh... no,
it's not gonna help;

20:37.928 --> 20:40.230
His chest can't expand
so...

20:40.298 --> 20:41.498
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>'Kay. What do we do?</i>

20:41.566 --> 20:43.232
We gotta get the air
out of his chest.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.767
- How?
- I don't know.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.835
I've never seen Scott do
anything like this before.

20:46.903 --> 20:49.305
Um... Why isn't Dr. Miller
calling me back?

20:49.373 --> 20:50.873
Ty, we need to get him
to the emergency clinic.

20:50.940 --> 20:54.009
We can't go to the clinic;
Lobo can't breathe.

20:54.077 --> 20:56.546
We're not gonna make it
there in time.

21:01.989 --> 21:03.455
<i>You don't look like a girl</i>
<i>who just cashed a cheque</i>

21:03.523 --> 21:05.290
for $5000 dollars.

21:05.358 --> 21:08.060
That's because
it bounced.

21:08.128 --> 21:09.762
I knew he was shifty.

21:09.829 --> 21:10.963
It's probably
just a mistake;

21:11.031 --> 21:12.397
A temporary
cash flow issue.

21:12.465 --> 21:13.532
Let's just go back
to the music store

21:13.599 --> 21:16.334
and clear this all up.

21:16.402 --> 21:17.536
Don't look at me
like that, Jake!

21:17.603 --> 21:19.436
Everything's fine.
Now, let's go!

21:21.940 --> 21:23.174
<i>(Door closes)</i>

21:23.241 --> 21:24.575
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Hello!</i>

21:25.844 --> 21:29.080
Oh! Something smells
good in here.

21:29.148 --> 21:30.948
Let's see what we have.

21:31.016 --> 21:33.885
(Chuckles, pleased)
Oh, baby...

21:33.952 --> 21:34.951
Mmm!

21:39.256 --> 21:41.357
(Deliberate knife slices)

21:42.959 --> 21:44.994
Hello to you, too!

21:46.863 --> 21:48.431
Okay, okay,
if this is about..

21:48.499 --> 21:49.566
Me not being there

21:49.633 --> 21:52.101
to help you
with this move of yours,

21:52.169 --> 21:54.070
Lou, I'm sorry,
I've been tied up.

21:54.137 --> 21:55.137
I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

21:55.706 --> 21:56.206
Do me a favour.

21:56.273 --> 22:00.342
Don't make me
any promises, dad.

22:00.410 --> 22:01.343
Okay.

22:01.411 --> 22:02.411
When I was fifteen,

22:02.478 --> 22:03.579
you promised
I'd see you again

22:03.646 --> 22:04.813
and you walked out
the door

22:04.880 --> 22:09.084
and I didn't see you
for ten years, so...

22:12.589 --> 22:13.855
What're you talking
about this for, Lou?

22:13.923 --> 22:15.089
This is ancient history.

22:17.158 --> 22:18.626
I'm not going anywhere.

22:18.694 --> 22:20.728
Well, I hope that's true,
dad, I really do,

22:20.795 --> 22:24.365
but, um, I don't know how
I'm supposed to trust you.

22:24.433 --> 22:25.499
You can trust me.

22:25.567 --> 22:27.835
No, dad, I can't!

22:27.902 --> 22:30.037
Not when you're drinking.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.139
No...

22:34.808 --> 22:37.810
Okay, if your grandfather
told you something,

22:37.878 --> 22:40.146
he's blowing this way
out of proportion.

22:40.214 --> 22:42.115
I don't want you
to see Katie any more.

22:42.182 --> 22:43.316
- Lou!
- No, I...

22:43.384 --> 22:45.118
If you're gonna
leave again,

22:45.185 --> 22:46.585
then I don't want you
to see her any more

22:46.653 --> 22:48.787
because it'll just be easier
that way, all right?

22:48.855 --> 22:50.556
Don't do this!

22:54.160 --> 22:55.193
I'm fine!

22:56.763 --> 22:59.131
I swear I'm fine!

22:59.198 --> 23:00.832
You better be.
(Tearing up)

23:00.900 --> 23:04.135
And if you're not,
then get help!

23:05.404 --> 23:08.105
There's dinner
if you're hungry.

23:12.978 --> 23:15.045
(Door chime jingles)

23:15.113 --> 23:16.481
Can you believe this?

23:16.548 --> 23:17.682
The manager of the store
hasn't heard of the guy

23:17.750 --> 23:18.682
I sold the guitar to.

23:18.750 --> 23:20.150
He doesn't even
work there.

23:20.217 --> 23:21.818
I can spot shifty
from a mile away;

23:21.886 --> 23:23.086
That guy was shifty.

23:23.154 --> 23:24.321
What am I gonna do?

23:24.389 --> 23:25.855
Well, you're gonna have
to call your dad.

23:25.923 --> 23:27.491
- No.
- Why not?

23:27.558 --> 23:29.326
Because I can't.

23:30.295 --> 23:31.261
He doesn't know
about your plans

23:31.329 --> 23:32.763
to move out,
does he?

23:32.830 --> 23:33.997
Not exactly.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.164
Well, then I guess...

23:35.231 --> 23:36.766
You're gonna have
to phone the police.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.000
No! They'll just tell
my parents

23:38.067 --> 23:39.234
and they can't find out
about this.

23:39.303 --> 23:41.103
You have to promise
not to tell them!

23:41.171 --> 23:42.338
I promise.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.675
This is a disaster.

23:45.742 --> 23:47.677
<i>I'm an idiot.</i>

23:47.744 --> 23:51.613
I really am moving
to Nashville, aren't I?

23:52.748 --> 23:54.683
Okay, here it is.

23:55.551 --> 23:57.151
<i>We need a three-way</i>
<i>stop valve.</i>

23:57.219 --> 23:58.653
It should be in that drawer
underneath the clipboard.

23:58.721 --> 24:00.522
Okay.
Uh... is this it?

24:01.490 --> 24:03.224
- Yeah, that's it.
- 'Kay, what else?

24:03.292 --> 24:04.892
Uh, we need a syringe,
and a needle and catheter.

24:04.960 --> 24:05.993
Where's that?

24:06.061 --> 24:07.093
Just in that drawer
on the left -

24:07.161 --> 24:08.595
- right beside, yup.
- Okay.

24:08.663 --> 24:09.896
Amy: Okay.
Ty: Thank you.

24:09.964 --> 24:10.764
Can you also get the drapes
ready right there?

24:10.832 --> 24:12.766
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

24:12.834 --> 24:14.935
You're gonna be okay, boy,
you hear me? You're okay.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.142
Jack, do you have
a second?

24:22.210 --> 24:23.643
Yeah, I guess.

24:24.611 --> 24:26.446
I think I did something
really bad.

24:26.513 --> 24:27.580
How bad?

24:28.782 --> 24:31.751
Pretty bad;
Like against the law bad.

24:31.819 --> 24:34.987
Okay,
start at the beginning.

24:35.055 --> 24:37.289
My dad has this
vintage guitar

24:37.358 --> 24:41.124
and I sort of...
borrowed it.

24:41.794 --> 24:43.462
You borrowed it.

24:43.529 --> 24:45.530
Okay, I stole it.

24:45.598 --> 24:47.566
Why would you do
something like that?

24:47.633 --> 24:49.234
I was desperate!

24:49.301 --> 24:50.969
I was really just gonna sell
some of my old things online,

24:51.036 --> 24:52.504
but then I saw the movers

24:52.572 --> 24:53.972
packing up
my dad's office

24:54.039 --> 24:55.439
<i>and I thought to myself,</i>

24:55.507 --> 24:56.940
<i>it's now or never,</i>
<i>Mallory.</i>

24:57.008 --> 24:58.876
This moment is gonna define
the rest of your life!

24:58.943 --> 25:02.045
All right!
Just get to the point.

25:02.113 --> 25:03.414
All right...

25:03.482 --> 25:05.215
I knew my dad wouldn't
miss his guitar

25:05.283 --> 25:06.784
until he was in Nashville,

25:06.852 --> 25:08.486
but by then I'd have
already sold it

25:08.553 --> 25:10.087
and I'd be living in
my own apartment,

25:10.154 --> 25:11.688
with a dishwasher,
in Hudson.

25:11.756 --> 25:13.623
You sold the guitar?

25:13.691 --> 25:15.224
Yes...

25:15.292 --> 25:16.593
<i>But then</i>
<i>the cheque bounced.</i>

25:16.660 --> 25:18.561
What were you thinking?

25:18.629 --> 25:22.732
Why do I have to move
my entire life to Nashville?

25:22.800 --> 25:25.835
This is my home.
It's not fair!

25:25.903 --> 25:27.503
So you think it's not fair!

25:27.570 --> 25:30.238
That doesn't justify stealing!

25:30.306 --> 25:33.074
I'm sorry, Jack.
I really am sorry.

25:33.142 --> 25:36.545
Please don't be
disappointed in me.

25:38.415 --> 25:40.348
I know... it was wrong,

25:41.317 --> 25:43.951
but my parents
are wrong too.

25:44.019 --> 25:46.053
How could they be
doing this to me?

25:48.990 --> 25:50.190
(Door closes)

25:50.258 --> 25:51.191
<i>Tim:</i>

I-I'm not really hungry.

25:56.899 --> 26:00.166
Well, Lou put this
together for you.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.036
I'll just leave it here.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.071
Save it for later.

<i>Yeah, I got a minute.</i>

26:26.993 --> 26:29.227
So what're we gonna do
about Shane?

26:29.295 --> 26:30.395
And please don't
mention lawyers

26:30.463 --> 26:32.897
because if this
goes to court,

26:32.965 --> 26:35.767
I'm gonna win
and you know it!

26:36.836 --> 26:37.502
You're holding
all the cards;

26:37.570 --> 26:39.838
Why don't you tell me?

26:41.306 --> 26:42.807
I want Shane

sorry about that.

26:55.419 --> 26:57.988
Well, that won't
happen again.

It's cold in here.
You cold?

27:00.024 --> 27:01.124
No, I'm fine.

Let me get you
a blanket.

You know, that smells
really good;

27:24.347 --> 27:25.514
Maybe I am hungry.

27:25.581 --> 27:27.049
Here, here.
I'll get it, I'll get it.

27:28.218 --> 27:29.251
(Fire crackles)

27:32.722 --> 27:34.089
Thank you.

27:38.427 --> 27:39.660
No, there are no onions
in it,

27:39.728 --> 27:42.030
I checked.
(Chuckles)

27:42.097 --> 27:43.164
You remember?

27:43.232 --> 27:44.665
Yeah!

27:44.733 --> 27:46.467
Shane doesn't like
onions either.

27:46.535 --> 27:49.337
No, Shane doesn't like
most vegetables,

27:49.405 --> 27:50.738
except maybe for corn.

27:50.805 --> 27:51.738
Yeah, but it has to be
out of the can;

27:51.805 --> 27:53.606
Can't be frozen.
(Laughs)

27:53.674 --> 27:55.675
Yeah,
he hates frozen.

27:55.743 --> 27:57.044
He likes broccoli.

27:57.111 --> 27:58.445
- No.
- Yeah.

27:58.513 --> 28:00.280
Yeah, Lou made this
broccoli casserole;

28:00.348 --> 28:01.381
He couldn't get
enough of it.

28:01.449 --> 28:02.615
You gotta get
that recipe.

28:02.683 --> 28:04.817
Yeah, I guess I do.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.558
Better set
another place;

28:12.625 --> 28:14.660
Mallory's joining us
for dinner.

28:14.727 --> 28:16.028
Can I spend the night,
Lou?

28:16.096 --> 28:18.364

anything, are you?

28:21.501 --> 28:22.734
Well, not tonight.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.402
<i>But tomorrow morning</i>
<i>you will.</i>

28:24.470 --> 28:25.603
<i>Is that clear?</i>

28:25.671 --> 28:27.305
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Yes, Jack.</i>

28:27.373 --> 28:29.507
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

28:32.344 --> 28:33.778
What was that about?

28:33.845 --> 28:36.181
Well, it's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

28:36.248 --> 28:37.715
Have you heard
from Amy?

28:37.783 --> 28:38.883
No. Not yet.

28:40.718 --> 28:44.254
Okay, attach the stop-valve
to the syringe.

28:44.322 --> 28:45.956
Ty:
Okay.

28:46.023 --> 28:47.057
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Make sure it's
in</i> <i>the off position.</i>

28:47.125 --> 28:48.559
It's off.

28:48.626 --> 28:51.428
Now you have to insert
the needle into the chest.

28:51.496 --> 28:52.862
(Oxygen hisses)

28:55.265 --> 28:56.332
So...

28:58.102 --> 28:59.435
What?

28:59.503 --> 29:00.903
There's a lot of blood vessels
in the chest,

29:00.971 --> 29:03.772
and if I was to hit one,
that would be uh...

29:03.840 --> 29:05.575
That would be bad.

29:05.642 --> 29:07.943
Then don't hit
a blood vessel then.

29:08.011 --> 29:09.078
Right.

29:10.514 --> 29:13.381
Okay, the intercostal
blood vessels lie just...

29:13.449 --> 29:15.083
Back from each rib,

29:15.151 --> 29:18.120
so from the front side...
Right here.

29:19.855 --> 29:21.723
You can do this.

29:25.194 --> 29:26.361
Okay, it's in.

29:28.463 --> 29:31.398
The syringe,
I'm opening the valve.

29:32.934 --> 29:33.700
Okay...

29:39.007 --> 29:41.008
Here goes nothing.

29:45.912 --> 29:47.079
It's working.

29:47.148 --> 29:49.482
<i>The air's coming out.</i>

29:52.819 --> 29:54.954
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>It's okay, boy.</i>

29:56.056 --> 29:57.423
And again.

29:59.292 --> 30:00.659
<i>How he's doing?</i>

30:00.726 --> 30:01.760
The same.

30:03.396 --> 30:05.497
Okay,
we keep going.

30:05.565 --> 30:07.098
Keep going.

30:12.233 --> 30:13.466
<i>That's it;</i>

30:14.368 --> 30:15.168
That's all the air
out of his chest.

30:15.236 --> 30:17.004
That's all we can do.

30:18.006 --> 30:19.272
(Oxygen hisses)

30:22.209 --> 30:24.677
We should've taken him
to the clinic.

30:24.745 --> 30:26.946
Ty, you made
the right choice.

30:27.014 --> 30:30.016
You did everything
you could.

30:31.218 --> 30:32.252
(Sighs heavily)

30:35.523 --> 30:36.523
<i>Miranda:</i>
<i>When was the last time</i>

30:36.590 --> 30:39.724
we just sat together
and talked.

30:39.792 --> 30:41.160
I don't know.

30:42.228 --> 30:44.129
Fort St. John?

30:44.197 --> 30:45.397
(Laughs)

30:46.999 --> 30:48.400
What?

30:48.468 --> 30:50.369
- Oh, nothing.
- What? What?

30:50.436 --> 30:52.437
Nothing.
I'm just...

30:53.672 --> 30:56.641
Thinking about that bar
where I met you.

30:56.708 --> 30:57.642
(Groans) What was
the name again?

30:57.709 --> 30:59.109
Jamie's.

30:59.178 --> 31:00.944
It was a dump.

31:01.012 --> 31:03.414
I remember the line
you used on me.

31:03.482 --> 31:04.482
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>It must've been good;</i>

31:04.550 --> 31:06.551
I was pretty smooth
back then.

31:06.618 --> 31:10.187
(Laughing) Smooth is not
the word I would use.

31:10.254 --> 31:12.222
You came up to me
and said,

31:13.191 --> 31:15.159
um, my friend over there
wants to know if you think...

31:15.226 --> 31:17.394
...think I'm handsome.
Yeah.

31:17.461 --> 31:18.796
It's a good line.

31:18.863 --> 31:20.998
It's not a good line.
It's sad and pathetic.

31:21.066 --> 31:22.267
(Laughs)

31:22.566 --> 31:24.267
Well, I
remember what you said.

31:24.335 --> 31:26.035
You said to me,

31:26.103 --> 31:28.171
you go tell your friend
that I've seen better.

31:28.238 --> 31:29.371
I did?

31:29.439 --> 31:31.774
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>(Laughing) Yeah.</i>

31:31.842 --> 31:34.077
Well, that's a great line.

31:35.445 --> 31:37.747
(Tim and Miranda both laugh)

31:38.682 --> 31:40.649
I wouldn't worry about
Shane fighting in school.

31:40.718 --> 31:42.984
That's just...
That's what kids do.

31:43.986 --> 31:45.653
Shane is a sensitive boy.

31:45.722 --> 31:47.889
He's not like the other kids
in his class.

31:47.957 --> 31:49.424
He's a lot tougher
than you think he is.

31:49.491 --> 31:52.427
You should've seen him
rope steers this summer.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.129
He was getting
pretty good at it.

31:54.197 --> 31:57.498
Rodeo's his new obsession,
thanks to you.

31:57.566 --> 32:00.467
Well,
he's his father's son.

32:00.535 --> 32:04.404
Yeah, well, he has other
interests, you know.

32:05.373 --> 32:07.574
Like last summer,
he went to writing camp.

32:07.642 --> 32:08.976
Riding camp...

32:09.044 --> 32:11.045
Writing camp.

32:11.113 --> 32:12.780
They have a camp
for that?

32:12.848 --> 32:14.580
They have a camp
for everything now -

32:14.648 --> 32:17.450
and he had the time
of his life, but...

32:17.517 --> 32:19.418
He didn't tell you that.

32:19.486 --> 32:20.787
Well, no.

32:22.623 --> 32:24.457
I don't care
if he went to writing camp

32:24.524 --> 32:26.626
or science camp or...

32:29.763 --> 32:33.098
I just want a chance
to be his father.

32:33.166 --> 32:34.399
I believe you.

32:36.136 --> 32:37.435
Now you just have
to prove it.

32:37.503 --> 32:39.571
Well, how do I do that?

32:39.639 --> 32:42.574
Well, this is a good start.

32:43.676 --> 32:45.010
(Fire crackles)

32:48.713 --> 32:50.481
<i>(Dog barks out back,</i>
<i>cats meow)</i>

32:50.548 --> 32:53.151
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Ty! Ty, come in here!</i>

32:56.922 --> 33:00.224
He's awake and I think
his breathing is better.

33:00.292 --> 33:01.425
Okay.

33:01.493 --> 33:02.993
Easy, boy...

33:03.895 --> 33:05.796
<i>Easy.</i>

33:05.863 --> 33:07.297
Yeah.

33:07.364 --> 33:09.933
Oh, he's definitely
sounding a lot better.

33:10.001 --> 33:10.901
(Lobo growls,
Ty laughs)

33:10.968 --> 33:12.502
Yeah!

33:12.569 --> 33:13.736
And his gums are nice
and pink;

33:13.805 --> 33:16.106
That means there's oxygen
in the blood.

33:16.174 --> 33:19.108
So he's gonna be
all right?

33:19.176 --> 33:21.043
Yeah, I think so.

33:21.111 --> 33:22.578
(Lobo growls softly,
Ty laughs)

33:22.646 --> 33:23.746
(Phone rings)

33:25.616 --> 33:26.949
Dr. Miller.

33:27.884 --> 33:29.585
Yeah, my girlfriend came in
with her dog.

33:29.653 --> 33:30.920
He has a pneumothorax.

33:30.987 --> 33:32.188
I took the air
out of his chest

33:32.255 --> 33:35.357
and he seems to be
stable now.

33:35.425 --> 33:37.058
I did it by myself,
and I'm sorry,

33:37.126 --> 33:38.293
I know I overstepped
my boundaries,

33:38.361 --> 33:39.294
but we didn't think
we could get him

33:39.362 --> 33:42.096
<i>to the emergency clinic.</i>

33:42.164 --> 33:43.465
<i>Okay.</i>

33:43.533 --> 33:45.734
No, thank you.
Um...

33:47.403 --> 33:50.305
Well,
Scott's a good teacher.

33:50.373 --> 33:51.806
Okay. Okay.

33:55.177 --> 33:58.179
He's on his way
right now.

33:58.247 --> 34:02.250
He said I did everything
he would've done.

34:03.452 --> 34:04.485
(Laughs)

34:05.454 --> 34:07.420
(Sighs, relieved)

34:08.755 --> 34:09.789
(Amy sighs)

34:16.630 --> 34:18.130
(Softly) Lou.

34:19.067 --> 34:20.199
Amy, hey...

34:21.168 --> 34:23.569
Hey. What're you doing
in here?

34:23.636 --> 34:24.603
I wanted to make sure
I saw you

34:24.670 --> 34:26.505
when you got home.

34:26.572 --> 34:28.741
Um, how's Lobo?

34:28.808 --> 34:31.077
He pulled through,
thanks to Ty.

34:31.143 --> 34:32.678
That's great.

34:32.746 --> 34:34.612
I am so exhausted.

34:35.547 --> 34:37.049
I think I could probably
sleep for a week.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.884
Yeah,
I don't blame you...

34:38.951 --> 34:40.650
(Clears throat)
But um...

34:40.719 --> 34:42.853
Amy, there's...

34:42.922 --> 34:45.891
There's something I need
to tell you about dad.

34:45.958 --> 34:46.992
Dad?

34:50.228 --> 34:51.228
(Birds chirp)

34:54.199 --> 34:55.399
<i>(Cell phone rings)</i>

34:58.904 --> 34:59.770
(Cell phone rings)

35:00.939 --> 35:02.072
Hello?

35:03.541 --> 35:05.542
Be right there.
(Phone beeps off)

35:11.315 --> 35:12.382
Jake, your eye.

35:13.350 --> 35:15.651
That's nothing;
Just a scratch.

35:15.719 --> 35:17.186
What happened?

35:17.254 --> 35:18.621
I tracked down
your dad's guitar.

35:18.688 --> 35:20.056
How?

35:20.124 --> 35:22.491
The music store manager
did some searching;

35:22.559 --> 35:23.726
The guy who tried
to rip you off

35:23.794 --> 35:26.262
was trying to resell
your guitar online.

35:26.330 --> 35:27.495
I asked him to set up
a meeting,

35:27.563 --> 35:30.198
I showed up,
and we had a little chat.

35:30.266 --> 35:31.333
Well, by the look
of your face,

35:31.401 --> 35:33.101
you did more
than just talk.

35:33.169 --> 35:36.305
Like I told you,
he was shifty.

35:36.372 --> 35:37.605
I'm sorry.

35:37.673 --> 35:39.207
I didn't mean to drag you
into all of this.

35:39.275 --> 35:41.509
You don't have
to be sorry.

35:41.577 --> 35:42.811
(Sighs)

35:42.878 --> 35:44.678
I'll get you some ice
for your eye.

35:44.746 --> 35:48.182
No, it's fine.
I'm gonna get going.

35:52.787 --> 35:53.921
This is the sweetest thing

35:53.989 --> 35:56.523
that anyone's ever
done for me.

35:59.961 --> 36:00.961
Thank you.

36:06.467 --> 36:08.835
(Gasps)
Hold that thought.

36:08.902 --> 36:10.170
One of these days,

36:10.237 --> 36:12.572
I'm gonna take you
on a proper date:

36:12.639 --> 36:15.941
Dinner, flowers,
the whole deal.

36:16.009 --> 36:18.010
Jake, I'm moving away.

36:18.078 --> 36:19.845
You'll be back.

36:22.682 --> 36:24.549
You have a nice day, now.

36:26.353 --> 36:29.955
(Birds twitter loudly outside,
door closes)

36:45.770 --> 36:47.137
(Groans quietly)

36:52.977 --> 36:55.012
(Footsteps thud lightly)

37:04.121 --> 37:05.221
(Door closes)

37:07.090 --> 37:09.525
(Blows warm air
on his hands)

37:10.960 --> 37:14.730
(Birds chirp and twitter,
wind gusts lightly)

37:21.603 --> 37:22.904
(Truck rumbles)

37:24.507 --> 37:25.840
(Screws cap back on bottle)

37:36.484 --> 37:37.918
Hey.

37:37.985 --> 37:40.187
Amy.

37:40.255 --> 37:41.321
(Sighs)

37:46.528 --> 37:47.894
Is everything
all right?

37:47.962 --> 37:50.531
Yeah. I just wanted
to see you.

37:52.066 --> 37:53.433
I love you, dad.

37:56.770 --> 37:59.137
I love you too,
honey.

38:01.941 --> 38:05.009
You know everything's
gonna be just fine, right?

38:05.078 --> 38:06.278
I believe you.

38:10.983 --> 38:13.617
(Choked up breaths)
I should go.

38:13.685 --> 38:14.685
Okay, okay.

38:15.653 --> 38:17.421
See you.

38:17.489 --> 38:18.855
Okay, bye.

38:21.226 --> 38:24.995
(Truck door opens and shuts,
engine fires up)

38:27.765 --> 38:29.466
(Truck rumbles away)

38:40.177 --> 38:42.945
(Bottle slides
across the ground)

38:49.652 --> 38:50.685
Come on.

39:00.396 --> 39:03.097
(Liquor splatters
on the ground)

39:06.868 --> 39:09.170
(Bottle lands with a soft thud
in the snow)

39:17.356 --> 39:20.491
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Boy, that is one amazing guitar.</i>

39:23.227 --> 39:24.260
Okay.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.631
You know what
you have to do.

39:27.699 --> 39:28.665
I got the guitar back.

39:28.733 --> 39:29.867
Can't we just pretend

39:29.934 --> 39:32.636
that none of this
ever happened?

39:32.704 --> 39:36.239
Fine, let's just
get it over with.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.741
Hey, Dad.
Uh, I'm fine.

39:40.143 --> 39:42.277
I have something
to tell you.

39:42.345 --> 39:44.514
Are you sitting down?

39:45.448 --> 39:47.316
So I'll call you as soon
as I get to Moose Jaw.

39:47.384 --> 39:48.818
Okay, okay.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.087
You better drive safely.

it's turning a bit.

39:54.223 --> 39:55.991
Yeah, I will,

39:56.058 --> 39:57.091
thanks.

40:00.129 --> 40:01.997
Okay.

40:02.064 --> 40:03.464
You know, I can't remember
the last time

40:03.533 --> 40:05.466
I stayed up all night
and talked like that.

40:05.535 --> 40:07.035
(Laughs)
Me either.

40:07.102 --> 40:09.570
(Sighs) Me either. Okay-

40:09.638 --> 40:11.839
Well, I have a long drive
ahead of me,

40:11.907 --> 40:14.008
so I'll...
I'll get going.

40:14.075 --> 40:15.142
- Bye.
- All right. Bye.

40:15.209 --> 40:17.545
(Door closes,
car starts up)

40:22.517 --> 40:23.517
Hey.

40:28.022 --> 40:29.121
I got a crazy idea.

40:29.189 --> 40:32.358
Why don't you just stay
another night?

40:32.426 --> 40:33.860
We'll talk.

40:39.399 --> 40:41.934
(Cats meow, birds chirp,
mice squeak)

40:42.001 --> 40:44.002
All right, Lady G,
lunchtime.

40:44.070 --> 40:45.136
(Dog barks)

40:46.505 --> 40:48.473
Hey, Bella,
look what I got for you!

40:48.541 --> 40:49.575
Huh? What's this? What's this?
You want it?

40:49.642 --> 40:51.409
(Bella groans)

40:51.477 --> 40:53.511
Yeah, a new chew toy
for you!

(Lobo pants)

40:57.415 --> 40:58.683
All right...

41:00.018 --> 41:01.318
How's he doing?

41:01.386 --> 41:02.620
I think he's pretty much
back to his old self,

41:02.688 --> 41:04.188
thanks to you.

41:04.255 --> 41:05.690
Yeah, Lobo...

41:07.459 --> 41:09.560
Well, Dr. Miller's got him
on some antibiotics.

41:09.628 --> 41:10.628
We're gonna keep
an eye on him.

41:10.696 --> 41:11.963
If there's no infection,

41:12.030 --> 41:13.630
you should be able
to take him home pretty soon.

41:13.698 --> 41:16.933
Oh... you hear that, Lobo?
You hear that?

41:18.435 --> 41:19.435
Thank you.

41:21.706 --> 41:24.708

say thank you.
