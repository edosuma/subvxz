WEBVTT

00:05.501 --> 00:09.457
- l'm sorry it has to be like this.
- Why?

00:11.182 --> 00:15.851
Back up the garbage truck, Cliffie.
Entering Dump City.

00:18.116 --> 00:20.194
Have a little sensitivity.

00:20.370 --> 00:24.457
That living, feeling human being
is about to be blown out of the water.

00:24.632 --> 00:28.469
You want to stand aside?
l can't see anything here.

00:28.641 --> 00:32.597
Sam, l know it's my fault.
l should have said something sooner.

00:32.777 --> 00:36.067
l'm sorry, it's just that l told you,
it's a rule with me.

00:36.243 --> 00:39.866
lt's the right thing to do.
l think we both realise that.

00:40.044 --> 00:42.087
- l suppose you're right.
- Yes.

00:42.258 --> 00:45.797
- Don't you think that if we worked...
- Let's make a clean break.

00:45.974 --> 00:51.190
Stop now and we'll still have all those
terrific memories. Now go, go.

00:51.363 --> 00:54.451
- Don't make it any tougher.
- Goodbye, Sam.

00:54.621 --> 00:55.821
Goodbye.

02:15.695 --> 02:19.234
You want to tell me what was wrong
with that one, Sammy?

02:19.411 --> 02:23.165
- She looked perfect. Body was a ten.
- So was her face.

02:23.337 --> 02:25.380
So was her lQ.

02:25.551 --> 02:27.713
Sam's kind of girl.

02:27.890 --> 02:30.183
She was married.

02:30.355 --> 02:34.773
She told me just now.
l don't mess around with married women.

02:34.948 --> 02:36.991
Me neither.

02:38.584 --> 02:42.372
lt's refreshing to know
you draw the line somewhere.

02:42.551 --> 02:47.470
There are three categories
of women l don't get involved with -

02:47.647 --> 02:50.771
married, underage, and comatose.

02:50.947 --> 02:54.118
He's added one.

02:54.288 --> 02:58.838
- Sam, may l have my purse, please?
- What are you grinning about?

02:59.008 --> 03:05.221
l was just confirming what a fortunate
thing it was that you and l split up.

03:05.398 --> 03:11.492
Now my love life is stable
and yours belongs in one.

03:16.259 --> 03:20.131
l'll have to share that with Frasier.
Puns are his greatest pleasure.

03:20.309 --> 03:23.398
Now that he's sleeping with you?

03:31.211 --> 03:35.797
Carla, that was a mean-spirited,
tasteless insult.

03:35.973 --> 03:38.932
- Why aren't you chortling?
- Leave me alone.

03:39.106 --> 03:42.776
l've got the worst toothache
in the history of the world.

03:42.948 --> 03:45.739
Must be an impacted wisdom fang!

03:45.955 --> 03:48.035
Die! You're going to die!

03:48.211 --> 03:52.714
Why don't you do with a toothache
what l did when l played in the minors?

03:52.890 --> 03:55.646
- What's that, Coach?
- See a dentist.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.405
You're right, Coach.
l'll have to go tomorrow.

04:02.579 --> 04:05.335
l got my bad dental habits
from my parents.

04:05.503 --> 04:08.793
They taught me to brush after every war.

04:08.970 --> 04:11.345
Coach, how about one for the road?

04:12.981 --> 04:15.271
So, Normie, how's Vera doing?

04:15.443 --> 04:18.783
She's all right,
but she's nagging to get a new house.

04:18.952 --> 04:21.827
Having any luck in finding one?

04:22.002 --> 04:24.497
We've got to get rid of the old one first.

04:24.676 --> 04:27.634
l've been thinking
about getting another place.

04:27.808 --> 04:31.941
- lt's yours.
- l'd like to take a look at it first.

04:32.109 --> 04:34.818
The man's a shrewd buyer, Coach.

04:34.991 --> 04:38.246
- What's wrong with where you're living?
- Nothing, really.

04:38.416 --> 04:41.542
l just thought it's time
l got a place of my own.

04:41.717 --> 04:45.589
- Where do you live now?
- You know where l live.

04:45.768 --> 04:50.651
- No, l've never been there.
- l...live at home.

04:51.615 --> 04:56.700
- At home? Whose home?
- My parents'. No big deal. Good night.

04:56.879 --> 05:01.345
Parents?
You live with mommy and daddy?

05:01.516 --> 05:04.889
- l... l live with my mother, Norm.
- For what?

05:05.065 --> 05:08.771
lt's not out of choice.
lt's more of a sense of responsibility.

05:08.949 --> 05:13.417
My father abandoned us
and l've become the man of the house.

05:13.586 --> 05:16.876
- You've got a curfew?
- Curfew! Come on, Norm.

05:17.053 --> 05:20.675
l can stay out as long as l call by ten.

05:21.648 --> 05:25.021
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Coach.

05:33.259 --> 05:37.214
- l'm sorry, we're closed.
- That's OK. l'm not a customer.

05:37.394 --> 05:40.767
- l'm looking for Sam Malone.
- You found him.

05:40.943 --> 05:44.115
l'm Maxine's husband.

05:44.285 --> 05:48.123
Not the Sam Malone, a Sam Malone.

05:48.296 --> 05:51.965
- Not the one you're looking for though.
- Why did you do it?

05:52.138 --> 05:56.973
Now, wait, wait! You just listen to me.
l did not know that she was married.

05:57.150 --> 06:00.939
She just told me today,
and the second l found out, l called it off.

06:01.118 --> 06:05.953
That was it. Ask her. l may have done
a lot of lousy things in my life,

06:06.130 --> 06:09.088
but l don't mess around
with other men's wives.

06:09.263 --> 06:15.060
- You're saying it's all her fault?
- l'm not saying it's anybody's fault.

06:15.235 --> 06:18.194
lt was just a big mistake, that's all.

06:19.205 --> 06:23.789
l know we've all been hurt
by this...and l'm sorry.

06:26.555 --> 06:31.355
What am l doing? Who am l kidding?

06:31.526 --> 06:33.605
She's a tramp.

06:33.782 --> 06:38.615
l think l've always known it
and l've never admitted it.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.969
You got anything to drink?

06:45.602 --> 06:49.022
l think l got a bottle here, someplace.

06:50.656 --> 06:54.659
- Scotch all right?
- Yes. bring it over, will you?

06:56.169 --> 06:58.746
You're not a mean drunk, are you?

07:00.471 --> 07:05.818
No, just a stupid one. Don't flatter
yourself thinking that you're the first.

07:05.985 --> 07:12.114
- There have been others.
- Out of curiosity, are they still with us?

07:17.137 --> 07:23.100
- lf she just weren't so damn gorgeous.
- Yes, l know.

07:23.277 --> 07:29.240
lt's tough being married
to a beautiful woman.

07:29.416 --> 07:34.169
You know,
tis like that sweet old love ballad says...

07:35.139 --> 07:38.346
''lf you want to be happy
for the rest of your life

07:38.522 --> 07:41.694
''Never make a pretty woman your wife

07:41.864 --> 07:46.247
''From my personal point of view
get an ugly girl to marry you''

07:47.838 --> 07:50.510
- Remember that?
- l should have listened!

07:53.350 --> 07:57.401
l'm really sorry, Sam.
l've been out of my mind.

07:57.569 --> 08:03.829
- Women! Look what they bring us to.
- They put you through hell, don't they?

08:04.001 --> 08:07.255
- l get the feeling they enjoy it, too.
- Yes.

08:07.426 --> 08:10.681
Why don't l hold on to this?

08:12.563 --> 08:16.020
Put it someplace where
it's not going to do any damage.

08:17.618 --> 08:20.623
l wish l hadn't done that.

08:25.178 --> 08:29.810
- Hey, everybody! Great day, isn't it?
- Did you get your tooth fixed?

08:29.980 --> 08:34.864
l am never going to be afraid
to go to the dentist again.

08:35.034 --> 08:37.957
l've found a way
to communicate with him.

08:38.126 --> 08:41.546
As he leaned in with his drill...

08:41.717 --> 08:46.185
l grabbed him
where l could get his attention

08:46.354 --> 08:50.773
and l said, ''We're not going
to hurt each other, are we?''

08:52.452 --> 08:54.698
- All right.
- Carla?

08:56.379 --> 09:00.513
- Did that work?
- We're having a late dinner.

09:03.020 --> 09:08.734
- Sam! What the hell happened to you?
- Nothing, really. Nothing at all.

09:08.910 --> 09:12.829
What do you mean?
You come limping in with a cane.

09:13.002 --> 09:18.087
There was a little trouble in the bar
last night, but it was no big deal.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.978
What happened, Sam? Come on.

09:27.663 --> 09:33.461
A thief broke in...l had to run him out...

09:33.636 --> 09:36.975
and...l caught a bullet in the...leg here.

09:37.145 --> 09:41.148
- A bullet in the leg!
- Come on, it's no big deal.

09:41.321 --> 09:44.077
Let's just go back to our business.

09:46.459 --> 09:50.463
Good Lord, Sam, you grappled
with an armed marauder?

09:51.597 --> 09:56.147
- You could have lost your life!
- Well, l guess l could have.

09:56.317 --> 09:59.357
But that's something
you only think about afterwards.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.324
Talk about guts!

10:02.498 --> 10:07.546
lt had nothing to do with guts, Norm.
lt's just reflex. l am an athlete.

10:07.719 --> 10:09.964
Let's hear it for Mayday. Another save?

10:15.279 --> 10:18.450
- Will you sit down here?
- No, l think l'll stand.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.579
Sam, you should give us some details.

10:23.216 --> 10:28.098
Details? All right, that's easy enough.

10:29.021 --> 10:33.773
Well, Coach...these guys
burst into the bar and they...

10:33.950 --> 10:36.111
l thought it was just one guy.

10:36.289 --> 10:42.383
No, l just said one guy
had a gun...that l saw.

10:43.599 --> 10:47.733
They could have all had guns,
but when they saw what l did to their pal,

10:47.901 --> 10:50.526
they just took off out of there.

10:50.699 --> 10:54.370
- Basically, they were all cowards.
- Amen to that, Sammy.

10:54.542 --> 10:57.963
All right, Coach.
The guy was holding his gun on me

10:58.134 --> 11:04.810
and l waited for the right moment
and then l kicked out with my leg,

11:04.984 --> 11:09.617
kind of like... l guess the closest
comparison would be Bruce Lee.

11:13.964 --> 11:16.839
l made contact with the gun,

11:17.013 --> 11:21.646
he pulled the trigger, the bullet caught
my leg and the gun went flying.

11:21.816 --> 11:23.943
And the rest just took off out of there.

11:24.114 --> 11:26.443
Big save!

11:28.583 --> 11:33.502
Come on! l guess l really shouldn't
have done it, but l'll tell you something.

11:33.679 --> 11:38.062
The next time one of those drunk,
drugged-out punks decide to break in

11:38.232 --> 11:43.780
and take advantage of an honest citizen,
they'll think twice about it, l'll tell you.

11:46.251 --> 11:49.957
- You guys!
- Just like the old days, Sam?

11:50.135 --> 11:52.844
Where are you going, Mayday?

11:53.895 --> 11:57.066
Well, l can still dance on it!

11:57.236 --> 12:01.406
l think there's something rotten
in the state of Denmark.

12:01.580 --> 12:04.122
lt's all that cheese.

12:15.030 --> 12:19.163
- Sam, when you say in the leg...
- All right, so it wasn't exactly the leg.

12:19.332 --> 12:24.713
- lt was a little higher up.
- The important thing is that you're OK.

12:24.886 --> 12:29.105
But exactly how did they manage
to shoot you in the ''l know what''?

12:30.483 --> 12:36.995
When you're surrounded by marauders
with automatic weapons, the bullets...

12:38.336 --> 12:42.589
When my husband left last night
with a gun, l never thought he would...

12:42.764 --> 12:47.812
Why think of something
that had nothing to do with me!

12:49.322 --> 12:53.372
l've got a question for you. Whatever
happened to the metric system?

12:53.540 --> 12:57.758
Weren't we supposed to change
all those measuring cups?

12:57.926 --> 13:02.559
That was your act of heroism?
Mayday's moment of truth?

13:02.729 --> 13:06.104
Shot in the fanny while fleeing
a jealous husband.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.821
Wait! Who said l was running away?

13:08.995 --> 13:14.542
How else do you explain
the location of your wound?

13:14.717 --> 13:20.515
l could have been coming at him and
turned a somersault to throw off his aim.

13:21.483 --> 13:26.068
You're lucky
that you didn't get brain damage.

13:27.414 --> 13:32.665
All right, let's get our facts straight.
l did not know she was married.

13:32.844 --> 13:35.386
And l was not running away,

13:35.559 --> 13:40.109
l was putting the gun
in my back pocket when it went off.

13:41.949 --> 13:45.121
This is a perfect comment
on your lifestyle.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.334
- Answer me one question.
- What?

13:47.505 --> 13:51.973
When you went to the doctor,
did you ask him to get the lead out?

13:52.142 --> 13:56.144
- Frasier will love that one, won't he?
- Frasier's weekend is made.

13:58.114 --> 14:01.286
Come on, no jokes.
Just do me one favour.

14:01.456 --> 14:04.129
l will not change your dressing.

14:04.296 --> 14:09.381
No, listen, just back me up on this?
lf everybody finds out what happened...

14:09.559 --> 14:13.812
They might make you
the butt of their jokes.

14:13.986 --> 14:19.499
- l'll save that one for his birthday.
- Just promise me, will you?

14:19.667 --> 14:22.161
Just don't say anything.

14:23.510 --> 14:27.727
Sure, Sam. l won't blow your story
but l must warn you...

14:27.895 --> 14:32.279
The bigger the lie, the bigger
the fool one might appear later to be.

14:32.448 --> 14:34.990
Well, whatever.

14:35.163 --> 14:38.537
The thing is that
l did get a little carried away,

14:38.713 --> 14:42.419
but there's no harm done
and it's all over. So, let's just forget it.

14:42.598 --> 14:47.480
Sam? There's a film crew
from the six o'clock news out here.

14:47.651 --> 14:49.944
Gee, l wonder what they want?

15:05.696 --> 15:09.116
Cliffie, are you going to buy
Norm's house or not?

15:09.287 --> 15:12.126
You bet, Coach. Don't tell him l said so,

15:12.295 --> 15:17.379
but the building inspector who checked
it out says his house is in terrific shape.

15:17.558 --> 15:19.601
Coach, draft, please.

15:19.772 --> 15:22.979
Why wouldn't you tell him
a thing like that?

15:23.155 --> 15:27.158
The guy is hot to sell.
l'm going to low-ball him on this one

15:27.332 --> 15:31.252
and he's going to end up
looking like a giant sap.

15:31.425 --> 15:34.300
Clifford! l can't believe my ears.

15:34.474 --> 15:39.059
Gee, and l've never believed
your hair or your nose.

15:39.235 --> 15:42.157
What does that leave us?

15:42.326 --> 15:45.498
You would take advantage
of your best friend?

15:45.668 --> 15:48.958
Friendship has its place,
but not in business.

15:49.135 --> 15:52.675
Especially in real estate
where it's strictly dog-eat-dog.

15:52.852 --> 15:56.606
One fidoburger coming up!

15:57.739 --> 16:01.410
Norm!
Could l have your ear for a second?

16:01.582 --> 16:06.797
Despite my building inspector's protest,
l've decided to put a bid on your house.

16:06.970 --> 16:11.223
There it is.
That's going have to be my top offer.

16:11.398 --> 16:15.781
- You got yourself a deal!
- Hey! What?

16:15.950 --> 16:19.573
- Everybody, l sold the house!
- Normie sold the house.

16:19.751 --> 16:22.840
l can look at
that place with the pool room.

16:23.009 --> 16:26.347
- That's an eight there.
- An eight! l thought it was a two!

16:26.517 --> 16:28.929
At last, English-speaking neighbours.

16:29.107 --> 16:31.269
What don't l know about this house?

16:31.446 --> 16:35.450
- The market value.
- That paper's not notarised, Norm.

16:35.623 --> 16:39.923
lt was an honour
meeting Boston's newest hero.

16:40.093 --> 16:43.347
Did anybody ever tell you
you were like Gary Cooper?

16:43.517 --> 16:47.473
- Yup!
- Good night. Great place.

16:47.652 --> 16:50.574
- Thanks very much.
- What a night!

16:50.743 --> 16:53.238
200 bucks in tips!

16:53.416 --> 16:59.011
- What will you do with all that money?
- l'm going spend it all on my kids.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.807
Good girl!

17:00.976 --> 17:05.895
How many gunny sacks and one-way
tickets do you think it'll buy?

17:06.071 --> 17:08.828
Gee, l don't know, Carla.

17:11.084 --> 17:14.126
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Never mind.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.259
Come on. What's the problem?

17:17.433 --> 17:20.308
You're living a lie, Sam.

17:20.482 --> 17:25.233
l know you won't listen to me but
our parents were right when they said,

17:25.411 --> 17:27.656
''No one profits by deceit.''

17:27.834 --> 17:34.427
Sorry, Diane, tonight's receipts are
making too much noise. l can't hear you.

17:34.600 --> 17:40.195
l honestly don't care what you do,
but l must say l'm a little disappointed.

17:40.364 --> 17:43.572
You're sure
you don't want to hang around,

17:43.747 --> 17:47.252
get naked and roll
around in all my money?

17:49.052 --> 17:52.057
You're no fun any more.

17:58.701 --> 18:02.954
- Hello again, Sam.
- Hello, Marvin.

18:04.340 --> 18:06.501
How are you doing?

18:06.678 --> 18:09.683
- This thing has turned out good for you.
- Yeah.

18:09.852 --> 18:12.181
l saw you on TV.

18:12.359 --> 18:17.194
There you were, the scum
who was messing around with my wife.

18:17.371 --> 18:22.254
- And they're treating you like a hero.
- You want to stop pointing guns at me?

18:22.425 --> 18:26.049
Sam... Don't mind me,
just carry on as if l weren't here.

18:26.226 --> 18:28.982
- You're not going anywhere.
- Come on, Marvin.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.859
- Let her go.
- So she can call the police?

18:32.032 --> 18:35.822
The police?
Obviously you don't know me.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.956
There's too much government
interference in our lives as it is.

18:40.135 --> 18:45.600
- Get back here.
- This is crazy. l was already shot once.

18:45.774 --> 18:50.442
- We're even.
- No, Sam, we're not even. Not yet.

18:50.619 --> 18:56.630
l can't sleep, l can't eat, l can't work!
All l can think about is you and my wife...

18:56.800 --> 19:00.389
Diane, isn't that a run in your stocking?

19:02.732 --> 19:07.401
My! You're right! What a nasty run.
Look at that.

19:07.577 --> 19:09.952
Just put some nail polish on it.

19:10.124 --> 19:16.254
l don't think nail polish will work on a run
this large and high up on one's thigh.

19:16.432 --> 19:19.187
- Do you, Marvin?
- Look, shut up!

19:23.992 --> 19:27.912
Just working a cramp out. There you go.

19:30.675 --> 19:33.431
- You'd better not try that again.
- Don't worry.

19:33.599 --> 19:37.139
- Move over here.
- Excuse me, Marvin?

19:37.316 --> 19:42.068
Listen to me. You're having trouble
with your marriage, aren't you?

19:42.245 --> 19:49.088
- Believe me, l understand how you feel.
- Nobody understands how l feel.

19:49.262 --> 19:52.302
- l do!
- Sure, sure!

19:52.478 --> 19:56.232
- You ever been in love with trash?
- Yes!

19:59.036 --> 20:01.826
This disgusting pile right here.

20:09.269 --> 20:12.477
Exactly. He's trash.

20:12.652 --> 20:17.654
But l...love him with all my heart.

20:18.583 --> 20:19.830
Why?

20:22.551 --> 20:25.224
Because...l've got to.

20:29.610 --> 20:35.657
You tell me. Why do you love her?
Because neither one of us can help it.

20:35.833 --> 20:42.510
But l'm asking you as a favour from one
sucker to another, don't waste my fella.

20:42.683 --> 20:46.734
- Sam, is this true? You and her?
- Yeah, absolutely.

20:46.902 --> 20:53.079
- l don't deserve her, but who does?
- And what do we get for loving them?

20:53.250 --> 20:57.552
A punch in the face, a kick in the gut,
a one-way ticket to Heartbreak City.

20:57.721 --> 21:00.726
He's a stockbroker.
Why are you talking like that?

21:00.895 --> 21:05.814
Lady, you're right.
You know exactly how l feel.

21:05.991 --> 21:09.530
The biggest favour
l could do for this lady is to shoot you.

21:09.708 --> 21:13.164
Way to go, sweetheart.
Actually, we're not that close.

21:13.341 --> 21:16.346
- Just an occasional movie date.
- l won't shoot you.

21:16.516 --> 21:21.019
You know why? Because
it would hurt her more than it would you.

21:21.194 --> 21:24.947
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

21:31.052 --> 21:35.102
lf you ever get tired of him
and you want someone

21:35.270 --> 21:40.699
who can give you a nice,
quiet home life, think of me.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.493
Mighty attractive offer.

21:47.132 --> 21:52.561
l don't believe this. You just saved
my life with that ridiculous story.

21:52.729 --> 21:56.567
l'm not sure l know
what to do to thank you.

21:56.739 --> 22:01.906
l can think of something.
But l don't think you're prepared to do it.

22:02.085 --> 22:05.506
Come on, of course l am.
Let's just go in my office here.

22:05.677 --> 22:10.144
Unfortunately, l'm injured, so you're
going to have to do most of the work.

22:12.110 --> 22:15.698
- Good night, Sam.
- l was kidding!

22:15.869 --> 22:17.995
l know what you're thinking about.

22:18.166 --> 22:22.300
You want me to set the record straight
about what happened the other night.

22:22.469 --> 22:24.594
Right?

22:26.854 --> 22:28.897
All right, l will.

22:29.068 --> 22:32.074
l'm going to call
the newspaper right now.

22:32.243 --> 22:35.331
- l didn't ask you to do that.
- l know, but l'm going to.

22:35.500 --> 22:41.013
This is important. Because
your respect for me is important to me.

22:41.181 --> 22:46.527
l always pretend it isn't, but the truth is,
l want you to think l'm a good person.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.576
- Really, Sam?
- Really.

22:59.224 --> 23:02.599
Sometimes you surprise me, Mr Malone.

23:03.736 --> 23:07.905
- And that's wonderful.
- Yeah.

23:09.584 --> 23:13.669
Hello,
can l speak to the City Desk, please?

23:13.843 --> 23:15.886
ls anyone else in?

23:16.976 --> 23:19.268
Who am l speaking to then?

23:19.440 --> 23:26.699
All right, Emily, this is Sam Malone
and l'm calling because l...

23:28.044 --> 23:30.718
You heard about that?

23:30.885 --> 23:35.969
Listen, the thing is that a lot of people
have been making a big deal...

23:36.148 --> 23:38.524
l'd like to meet you, too.

23:39.572 --> 23:42.032
What time do you get off work?

23:43.249 --> 23:45.922
No, 4:00 am, that's no problem for me.

23:49.765 --> 23:51.808
That's great, yeah.

23:51.979 --> 23:54.770
Well... Afraid?

23:54.944 --> 23:58.994
Emily, l'd be lying
if l said that l wasn't, but the...

23:59.162 --> 24:02.167
You're not married, are you?
