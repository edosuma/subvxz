00:04.091 --> 00:06.049
- Previously
On "Good Girls"...

00:06.093 --> 00:07.224
- I had him
recall the nail polish.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.399
- What's that?

00:08.443 --> 00:09.618
- Oh, we had
to change the formula.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.141
- Change it back.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.317
- There is a nail salon
selling 'em for $200 a bottle.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.319
- Nail salon robbed.
Guess what they took.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.321
- I figured out
who we should help.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.453
I got their daughter's kidney.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.063
- You had pizza
with your therapist?

00:20.107 --> 00:21.673
- He's helping me.
It's like a study buddy.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.371
- I wanted to introduce you
to Lila.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.633
Thought you could use
a real tutor.

00:24.676 --> 00:27.114
- What are you guys into?
- We have fun.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.419
- Dr. Cohen.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.856
- I quit my job today.
- Why?

00:30.900 --> 00:32.597
- I kissed my boss.

00:32.641 --> 00:34.425
- We have enough
to hire Max's cousin.

00:34.469 --> 00:37.646
You're gonna need a sniper.
I know a guy.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.082
- How does this work?

00:39.126 --> 00:40.301
- Say I'm your lawyer--

00:40.344 --> 00:42.477
trial itself
will run you 60 grand.

00:42.520 --> 00:46.742
So how is Friday...
morning?

00:46.785 --> 00:48.700
- That works.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.923
- How are we
gonna know?

00:53.966 --> 00:57.448
- It's not like they're gonna
run his mugshots in the obits.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.885
- And do we get
a phone call or--

00:59.929 --> 01:04.629
- He just said 11:00 on Friday.

01:08.851 --> 01:10.548
- It's 10:56.

01:11.636 --> 01:14.857
- You're dead.
- No, you're dead.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.163
- You are!

01:19.818 --> 01:21.255
- 10:57.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.216
- It'll be good
to be normal again.

01:26.260 --> 01:29.480
- Be whatever we wanna be.
- Finally.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.003
- Dude.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.483

Darrel the puck,

A great defensive man

02:51.693 --> 02:54.348
That's way more valuable

02:57.568 --> 02:59.657
Do you remember when...

02:59.701 --> 03:01.877
Darrel peed himself

You put it

03:34.518 --> 03:36.477
not the menu notes.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.869
- What's the difference?

03:37.913 --> 03:40.394
- Well, delivery note's more
for, like, a gate code

03:40.437 --> 03:41.656
or if the dog's out--

03:41.699 --> 03:43.571
- I can't eat wings
without ranch, dude.

03:43.614 --> 03:46.878

Uncle Darren, right?

04:03.982 --> 04:06.071
- Thought you were gonna be
with your tutor today.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.551
- I leveled up.
Tch.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.901
- I also offer college prep,
you know, when it's time.

04:09.945 --> 04:13.296
- Oh, he's gonna need
all the LSATs, GMATs, MCATs,

04:13.340 --> 04:14.819
all the ATs.

04:14.863 --> 04:17.692
- 'Cause I'm gonna be a lawyer,
doctor, Wall Streeter?

04:17.735 --> 04:19.607
- Okay, go do
your homework please.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.043
Go on.

04:21.086 --> 04:23.437
- Dream it, believe it, be it.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.571
Intense.
- Yeah.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.704
But, you know, he's
really counting on me,

04:29.747 --> 04:32.054
so I gotta pass this thing.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.925
- All right, so check it.

04:33.969 --> 04:37.320
300 for the ID, another hunny
for travel and incidentals.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.191
Then there's my fee--
that's another grand.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.672
- Well, how much to
just not look like a dummy?

04:41.716 --> 04:45.328
- Uh, same fee, but, you know,
for friends and family--

04:45.372 --> 04:47.591
yeah, I could finagle
a low-interest student loan.

04:47.635 --> 04:50.899
- You know what?
I'll just pay it.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.952
- Buh-buh-buh-bum!

05:07.002 --> 05:08.046
- Congratulations.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.613
- Couldn't have done it
without you.

05:13.356 --> 05:15.576
- Two, three, four.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.578
And exhale, two, three...

05:17.621 --> 05:19.841
- You sweat like cold cuts
on a counter.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.931
- Hey, put that back.
- I'm thirsty.

05:22.974 --> 05:25.803
- It's 10 bucks.
- You have to pay?

05:25.847 --> 05:27.718
- You don't?

05:27.762 --> 05:30.547
- DL Dave said
I could put stuff on his tab.

05:30.591 --> 05:33.681
- What?
- Two, three, four--

05:36.031 --> 05:38.338
Who can I plow
to get that arrangement?

05:38.381 --> 05:39.991
- Lisa from
counterterrorism's game.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.820
- Take it easy.
Now, what do we got?

05:44.909 --> 05:48.739
- Most of the women there
that day live in a shelter.

05:48.783 --> 05:52.177
- Mm, easy to pin it on.
- Or they just need the money.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.397
- Convenient.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.182
- That shade goes
for a lot on eBay.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.793
God knows why--it's dreadful.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.929
- Why were they there?
- Some weird church event.

06:04.973 --> 06:08.063
- Who planned it?
- You're fishing.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.849
- Figure out
who brought 'em in.

06:11.893 --> 06:14.374
- What are you gonna do?
- Raid your minibar.

06:14.417 --> 06:17.855
- I threw it all up already.
- You gotta stop doing that.

06:18.987 --> 06:21.076
- I need you to go
to the fancy grocery store.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.211
- My parents are coming?

06:26.255 --> 06:27.865
- It's way worse.
- Who?

06:29.563 --> 06:30.912
- Donor family.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.612
Sara invited them to dinner.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.832
- No.
- She's cleansing her soul.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.181
- What?

06:39.224 --> 06:41.575
Can't she, like,
save a rainforest or something?

06:41.618 --> 06:43.403
- I told her to do it.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.581
- We danced...
- I know.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.801
- The day their kid died.
- Baked potatoes, yeah?

06:50.845 --> 06:53.456
- Every holiday,
every birthday--

06:53.500 --> 06:55.632
- Twice baked--
everyone loves those.

06:55.676 --> 06:58.809
- Whenever I see my baby girl,
I wanna dance.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.550
- I know.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.639
- So how the hell am I supposed
to look those people in the eye

07:02.683 --> 07:04.641
when I danced
on their daughter's grave?

07:07.601 --> 07:08.950
- They're coming in
from Madison.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.734
- Call it off.

07:10.778 --> 07:13.824
- Our souls could use
some housekeeping too.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.741
I still need a dessert.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.308
- I'll make

09:43.147 --> 09:44.453

09:47.935 --> 09:49.632
- We're actually
printing tonight,

09:49.676 --> 09:52.287
so if you, uh,
like if you wanted to,

09:52.330 --> 09:55.682
we could do the drop-off early.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.509
- That won't be necessary.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.110
- So last time you were cash
heavy, things got tricky...

10:33.154 --> 10:34.895
'cause you and your girls
went stupid

10:34.938 --> 10:36.723
and burned it with the Feds.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.000
You don't turn this properly,
you will attract attention.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.176
You need a system.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.267
I'ma ask you again.

10:59.310 --> 11:02.052
Where's it been goin'?

11:04.011 --> 11:05.708
- Somewhere safe.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.492
- What, like a mattress?

11:07.536 --> 11:10.321
- Yeah.
- Except you ain't got one.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.717
Where's the money going?

11:19.069 --> 11:20.941
- I can't tell you.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.595
- Then I can't cut you in
anymore.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.516
- You hungry?

11:31.560 --> 11:32.909
- No.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.955
- Mind if we stop at IHOP?

11:34.998 --> 11:37.218
- Who does he think
he is anyway, your father?

11:37.261 --> 11:39.655
I mean,
taking away your allowance?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.526
- How?!

11:41.570 --> 11:42.832
- It's like, what's next?
You know?

11:42.876 --> 11:45.052
Put away your toys
or you're grounded?

11:45.095 --> 11:47.141
- How is he still alive?

11:47.184 --> 11:49.230
- Hey, Dad, it's my money.
You know?

11:49.273 --> 11:50.405
It's like--

11:50.448 --> 11:52.624
- And, like, what am I
supposed to say?

11:52.668 --> 11:54.496
"Don't worry about it.
It went to a good cause.

11:54.539 --> 11:55.932
I put a hit out on you.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.413
- That did not happen.

11:58.456 --> 12:01.329
Unkillable.
Unhuman.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.070
- You know what
I would really love?

12:03.113 --> 12:05.594
Is if he would just show up at
one of your houses next time

12:05.637 --> 12:07.509
so you know what it's like
to think on your feet.

12:07.552 --> 12:11.208
- There shouldn't be a next
time 'cause we already paid.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.776
Old boy's gotta go.

12:15.473 --> 12:19.303
- Hi, I am here to see
a Mr. James Fitzpatrick.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.786
- Who, may I ask,
is inquiring?

12:23.830 --> 12:25.483
- Uh, a customer?

12:25.527 --> 12:28.704
- Yeah, a very upset customer,
so...

12:33.274 --> 12:35.798
- Uh, do you know
how much overnight costs?

12:37.844 --> 12:39.323
- I don't work here.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.456
- Oh, I'm sorry, I just--

12:41.499 --> 12:43.110
I thought
'cause of your shirt.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.852
- I can help you, sir.
- See...

12:47.244 --> 12:48.637
- I'm sorry,
but Mr. Fitzpatrick

12:48.680 --> 12:50.421
is not available at the moment.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.249
- But he's back there.

12:52.293 --> 12:54.425
- But not available.

12:54.469 --> 12:57.646
- Tell him that Beth is here.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.126
- Again, I am so sorry,
but I--

12:59.169 --> 13:01.781
- Boland.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.218
- Oh, hold on.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.489
He left something for you.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.493
- What the hell is this?

13:18.536 --> 13:20.321
- He said it was
like hiring a lawyer.

13:20.364 --> 13:21.844
They charge by the hour.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.804
- And then do nothing?
- Yes, like a lawyer.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.419
- 11,000 in incidentals.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.856
- I'm sorry,
why does he need the omakase

13:33.900 --> 13:35.162
to not kill gang friend?

13:35.205 --> 13:37.338
- And what is "OT"?

13:37.381 --> 13:40.689
- Occupational therapy
for manual dexterity.

13:40.732 --> 13:43.300
- What, like his trigger finger
is sore or something?

13:43.344 --> 13:45.041
How is that on us?

13:45.085 --> 13:46.347
- You guys...

13:48.131 --> 13:49.741
That's him.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.395
- That's him?

13:51.439 --> 13:54.094
Well, I'm telling his clown ass
that we're not paying

13:54.137 --> 13:56.531
for his spray tan sessions.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.925
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.972
- Oh, he plays the cello?
- That's a guitar.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.888
- It's a cello.
The case gives it away.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.107
Has a much narrower neck

14:07.150 --> 14:08.848
and a more
cambered fingerboard.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.458
- That's no cello.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.779
- Think he's gonna
smoke someone?

14:29.346 --> 14:30.957
- Oh, boy.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.568
- Here we go.

14:53.153 --> 14:56.199
- It's a mob hit.
Classic.

15:16.393 --> 15:17.960
- Nope.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.527
- Huh.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.984
- Oh, God.
Oh, my God!

15:42.028 --> 15:43.725
- Jesus.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.205
- Who would want her dead?

15:45.248 --> 15:46.946
- She looks so sweet!

15:55.867 --> 15:59.567
- I'd feel a whole lot better
if he carried a wallet.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.635
- Oh, my God, it's a school.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.161
- Oh, no.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.034
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.775
- Daddy!

16:38.214 --> 16:40.564
- Hmm...

16:41.348 --> 16:43.089
- It's a cello.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.186
- Uh-oh.

16:56.363 --> 16:59.018
- We should get out of here.
- How?

17:00.802 --> 17:02.369
- He's already seen us.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.240
- And we've seen too much.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.072
- Do not.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.381
- What's he gonna do?

17:14.424 --> 17:16.078
- Give us a lollipop?

17:18.167 --> 17:20.082
- All right, fine, open it.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.094
- I didn't know
your daughter went here.

17:32.138 --> 17:35.358
It's got a great...
music program.

17:36.229 --> 17:39.188
- Ms. Marks, Ms. Hill.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.929
- Hey
- 'Sup?

17:40.972 --> 17:43.888
- Why are you following me?

17:43.932 --> 17:45.238
- Um...

17:47.022 --> 17:50.895
Just...curious...

17:50.939 --> 17:53.420
about the state of our lawsuit.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.987
- It's not moving forward.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.120
- We already paid for it.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.991
- Yeah,
and you billed us for more.

18:00.035 --> 18:03.125
- If you refer to article 3-A
in the contract you signed,

18:03.169 --> 18:05.475
I have the right to terminate
due to breach.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.303
- How did we breach?

18:07.347 --> 18:08.957
- Failure to disclose
the nature

18:09.000 --> 18:10.741
of your relationship
with the target.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.482
- What does that mean?

18:14.354 --> 18:17.096
- Which one of you engaged
in flagrante delicto?

18:17.139 --> 18:18.923
- Excuse me?

18:18.967 --> 18:20.447
- Who boned him?

18:22.797 --> 18:24.538
He go for a ride
on the jazzy?

18:26.017 --> 18:28.281
- What about you,
little bird?

18:28.324 --> 18:31.762
- Why does it matter?
- I don't do jilted lovers.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.765
- Uh, okay, no one was jilted.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.246
- There it is.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.683
- Come on, man.
It was one and done.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.078
- I mean,
for the most part.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.254
So this is where
you draw your line?

18:45.298 --> 18:47.082
- Crimes of passion
get messy.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.779
- Okay, again,
the word passion--

18:48.823 --> 18:51.086
- Clients, they have regrets,
they start talking.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.002
Before you know it, I have to
dispose of everyone involved.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.571
And on my own dime no less.

18:59.442 --> 19:02.010
- Well, we're not paying
for this.

19:02.793 --> 19:05.535
- You don't want this
going to collections.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.281
- Oh, my.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.718
- Is that his tongue?

19:18.026 --> 19:20.246
- It's a nasty process.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.821
- So here's your registration.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.127
Check the box for Muskegon.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.737
That's where my hookup is.
- Cool.

19:33.781 --> 19:37.132
Oh, hey, you know how you have
that friends and family loan?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.568
- How sick is this?
Look at this.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.049
Made the middle name Annie
so it's like, you know,

19:41.092 --> 19:42.920
named after my mom
or something.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.226
- That's tight.

19:44.270 --> 19:47.011
Um, instead of a loan...
- Same social though.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.362
- What about like a...
scholarship?

19:49.405 --> 19:54.497
You know, for high achievers
such as myself.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.719
- You don't have
the money do you?

19:58.762 --> 20:01.983
- I--I will.

20:02.026 --> 20:04.899
- When?

20:04.942 --> 20:06.596
That's the gray area.
- Bruh!

20:06.640 --> 20:09.338
- Dude, dude, dude, I had it.
- Dick move.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.513
- No, no, no, I just got hit

20:10.557 --> 20:13.081
with something
majorly big, okay?

20:13.124 --> 20:16.824
- You still owe me for the ID.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.521
- Come on, Boo.
It's just--

20:18.565 --> 20:21.220
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, I do this for you,

20:21.263 --> 20:23.570
every loser jonesing
for a diploma's

20:23.613 --> 20:25.833
gonna want a piece, so no.
Uh-uh.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.661
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.229
How am I supposed to do this
without you?

20:30.272 --> 20:33.232
- I don't know.
Maybe study?

20:37.975 --> 20:39.542
- Thanks again
for making the trip.

20:39.586 --> 20:42.241
- Uh...I hope you
brought your appetite.

20:43.416 --> 20:46.027
- I hope this wasn't
too much trouble.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.811
- It was nothing.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.726
- Looks like Thanksgiving.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.730
- And we have so much
to be thankful for.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.821
- Well,
dig in, everyone.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.562
- Okay, let's, let's, uh...

20:59.606 --> 21:01.260
- See what happens, right?
- I'm so hungry.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.916
- Mmm.
Hmm?

21:05.960 --> 21:08.441
- I'm sorry.
Would you mind?

21:09.790 --> 21:11.400
- Ever since, uh...

21:13.010 --> 21:15.186
We always say a blessing.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.713
- Where did my manners go?
- Must be somewhere.

21:22.846 --> 21:25.284
- Okay.
Mmm.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.856
Okay.
Here we go.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.902
- Bless us, oh Lord,
for these thy gifts

21:34.945 --> 21:36.338
we are about to receive.

21:36.382 --> 21:39.080
Give us grateful hearts
for all thy mercies

21:39.123 --> 21:42.779
and bless our loved ones,
especially our dear Heather

21:42.823 --> 21:46.174
who we know would love
to be here tonight...

21:46.217 --> 21:48.045
but she is here, right hon?
- Mm-hmm.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.874
- And we thank you, Lord,
for carrying her spirit on

21:50.918 --> 21:52.615
in beautiful Sara.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.490
- Whew.
Wow.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.843
That ham though.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.106
Mm-hmm.
Thank you, Lord.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.455
- Oh.

22:06.499 --> 22:07.587
- Huh?

22:10.894 --> 22:11.852
- Stan.

22:17.292 --> 22:20.513
- Oh, okay, all right.

22:21.818 --> 22:22.776
Okay.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.828
- And Lord, you know...

22:33.569 --> 22:35.789
Um, everything Carl said...

22:37.225 --> 22:39.749
And, uh, just wanna

22:39.793 --> 22:41.751
thank you for blessing us
with the opportunity

22:41.795 --> 22:42.839
to meet these guys,

22:42.883 --> 22:45.494
and so happy and glad
my baby girl

22:45.538 --> 22:47.801
could make this happen.

22:47.844 --> 22:51.021
Obviously, you know,
we wished it was, uh,

22:51.065 --> 22:53.154
under different circumstances,
but, you know,

22:53.197 --> 22:57.201
you work in mysterious ways,
and God bless the food, amen.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.333
- Now can we eat?

22:58.377 --> 22:59.595
- Oh!

23:00.509 --> 23:03.947
- Yes.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.514
- Oh...
- So, um...

23:05.558 --> 23:07.429
how was the trip down?

23:07.473 --> 23:09.388
- Oh, we took the bus.

23:10.519 --> 23:13.217
- That's a...16-hour trip.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.002
- Oh, not for us.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.265
- We could only afford to go
as far as Kenosha,

23:17.308 --> 23:20.834
so we did
a bit of a ride share

23:20.877 --> 23:22.488
situation from there.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.405
- Where's your car?

23:26.448 --> 23:28.363
- Um...
- Oh.

23:28.407 --> 23:32.498
- We sold it
after, um, Carl lost his job.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.458
- But, you know,

23:36.502 --> 23:37.764
I've been doing
so much walking.

23:37.807 --> 23:40.419
I dropped my cholesterol
50 points.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.985
Doctor's pleased.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.813
So...

23:45.598 --> 23:46.903
- And the people at the church

23:46.947 --> 23:48.427
have been real kind,
pitching in.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.080
- Mm, yes.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.865
And what can you do?

23:51.908 --> 23:55.172
When life gives you lemons,
you can't rob a bank.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.044
- Ha ha ha ha!

24:01.440 --> 24:05.052
- So, um, how are you
gonna get back?

24:07.315 --> 24:09.796
- Can we buy 'em
a bus ticket?

24:10.666 --> 24:12.233
- Yeah.
- Oh.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.974
- We can work something out...
- We can work something out.

24:14.017 --> 24:17.499
- No, no, we're not here
for handouts.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.153
Although, I would try
some of those

24:19.196 --> 24:20.720
delicious-looking
mashed potatoes.

24:22.852 --> 24:24.506
- Here ya go.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.596
- No, from here it's easy.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.381
A daughter of a friend of ours
has offered to drive us

24:30.425 --> 24:31.861
as far as Lancing.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.777
And now, from there,
it's what many would call

24:34.821 --> 24:37.388
a scenic hike
up in God's country

24:37.432 --> 24:40.217
where, uh,
if my wife's ankles hold up,

24:40.261 --> 24:42.611
we'll just take one day
to get back to the interstate.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.874
- We'll work this off, huh?

24:44.918 --> 24:46.354
Good heavens!
- Well, we'll have to.

24:46.397 --> 24:50.140
- Such good people.
- I know.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.795
- We're not.
- I know.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.846
- How do we get back
to that?

25:17.690 --> 25:19.822
- Sweet potato pie
comin' in hot.

25:24.174 --> 25:26.699
- We still have
that pressure washer?

25:28.396 --> 25:29.832
- What is that?

25:29.876 --> 25:33.575
- Everyone wants hot sauce,
so I went to Costco.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.012
I got a vat of the stuff
and those little plastic cups

25:36.056 --> 25:38.580
so I could just dispense it
from the backseat.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.408
It's pretty smart, right?

25:40.451 --> 25:42.758
- It's why you're five star.

25:42.802 --> 25:47.067
- Yeah, well,
hot sauce in a hot car--

25:47.110 --> 25:48.677
- Oh, my God.
- Just...

25:48.721 --> 25:51.419
- Ugh!
- Everywhere.

25:56.424 --> 25:59.035
I'm so sorry, Beth.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.950
- Why?

26:04.650 --> 26:07.914
- 'Cause I--I can't do it.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.179
Then don't.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.312
Well, how are we
supposed to, I mean--

26:15.356 --> 26:18.446
+- Well, what do you wanna do?

26:21.101 --> 26:22.668
Hot tubs.

26:24.670 --> 26:28.021
Rich people love 'em,
negotiable prices--

26:30.458 --> 26:32.939
Financing plans, layaway--

26:32.982 --> 26:35.463
there's, like, a million ways
to cook the books.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.033
It's not regulated.
There's no licensing.

26:40.076 --> 26:42.426
Any idiot can sell them,

26:42.470 --> 26:44.603
and I know just the guy.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.435
You said I needed a system.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.133
This is my system.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.439
Sistema.

27:08.191 --> 27:11.151
- Go ahead and hate it
because you didn't think of it,

27:11.194 --> 27:13.066
but your stupid carwash,

27:13.109 --> 27:15.503
it's one of the IRS's
first targets

27:15.546 --> 27:17.766
right behind coin laundromats.

27:17.810 --> 27:21.117
I Googled it.
Guess what's not on the list.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.817
Hot tubs.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.690
- They're called spas.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.521
Pay her.
Deduct the artwork.

27:40.702 --> 27:43.270
- Good morning, Mrs. Boland.
- Get him.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.315
- I don't believe that I have
another package for you today.

27:45.359 --> 27:48.492
- Get him.
I have his money.

27:48.536 --> 27:51.887
I just have a few questions.
- Hm?

27:51.931 --> 27:54.324
- What does omakase
have to do with it?

27:54.368 --> 27:56.196
- It means entrusting yourself
to the chef.

27:56.239 --> 27:59.634
Typically off menu,
locally driven, sushi grade--

27:59.678 --> 28:01.375
- I mean how does it help...

28:04.595 --> 28:06.641
With killing a man?

28:06.685 --> 28:08.904
- Your lover enjoys a two-hour
omakase lunch every Friday.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.079
Never misses.

28:10.123 --> 28:12.038
After, he goes out
into the parking lot

28:12.081 --> 28:14.605
and has a chat with the chef.
It's an opportunity.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.477
He then does various business
with people

28:16.520 --> 28:18.653
who would make my work
difficult.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.133
Not an opportunity.

28:20.176 --> 28:22.744
On Tuesdays, he plays tennis
at a very posh country club.

28:22.788 --> 28:25.747
You'll see the charge
for the valet in there.

28:25.791 --> 28:29.272
He does shower after
in an unattended locker room.

28:29.316 --> 28:30.447
It's another opportunity.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.884
You see where
I'm headed with this?

28:31.927 --> 28:33.494
I didn't put in all the details
because then I would

28:33.537 --> 28:36.410
have to charge you for the time
it took to explain them.

28:42.068 --> 28:45.419
- Story of my life.
- What's that?

28:47.813 --> 28:49.597
- Missed opportunities.

28:51.251 --> 28:53.427
- One thing
I couldn't figure out...

28:56.560 --> 29:01.217
Married mother of four,
Junior League, PTA,

29:01.261 --> 29:04.351
winner of the state fair
mini muffin baking competition

29:04.394 --> 29:06.701
three years running.
- You dig deep.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.574
- So how's a lady like you
get involved

29:10.618 --> 29:12.359
with a guy like that?

29:19.540 --> 29:22.282
- I was just bored.

29:27.504 --> 29:31.073
- Tomorrow at noon--
I'll text you the address.

29:31.117 --> 29:34.076
Let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.383
- I am gonna replace
this thing.

29:42.128 --> 29:44.652
- Oh, my lord!

29:46.349 --> 29:48.830
- I didn't know
what you guys like, so...

29:48.874 --> 29:51.485
- I've never had crepes.

29:51.528 --> 29:52.834
- I did a bit of
everything.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.401
- Ohh!

29:56.751 --> 29:58.709
Mmm.

30:00.189 --> 30:03.323
- So you sleep okay?
Harry's bed's a little tight.

30:03.366 --> 30:06.456
- That comforter
is like sleeping on a cloud.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.545
- Right?
His grandma gave it to him.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.156
- Aw.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.681
You guys are so lucky.

30:19.556 --> 30:21.471
- So I made some sandwiches
for the road,

30:21.515 --> 30:23.909
and we can pack up some treats.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.475
- Oh, you're amazing.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.434
- If there's anything
we can do, don't hesitate.

30:32.656 --> 30:35.181
- How about a car?

30:36.051 --> 30:37.139
- Pardon?

30:37.183 --> 30:40.055
- Mm, Carl's too proud to ask.

30:43.537 --> 30:46.583
- I know it seems
like we're doing okay,

30:46.627 --> 30:48.585
but I promise you,

30:48.629 --> 30:50.544
the struggle
is real everywhere.

30:53.503 --> 30:55.418
- Is it?

30:55.462 --> 30:58.726
- We work triple shifts
and juggle bills,

30:58.769 --> 31:00.597
max out credit cards.

31:00.641 --> 31:04.384
- Your daughter is sleeping
safe in her bed.

31:09.563 --> 31:13.088
- Ooh, is the duchess
coming to breakfast?

31:14.437 --> 31:16.570
- 'Cause this can't be for us.
Is it?

31:16.613 --> 31:19.486
- Honey, that is just
the kind of people they are.

31:19.529 --> 31:22.489
- Well, it's like having
our own restaurant.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.794
Oh.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.927
- Look at that.
I think it's fresh squeezed.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.366
- What is this?

31:30.410 --> 31:32.194
- It's "Naked and Afraid,"
dog.

31:33.369 --> 31:34.849
- You should be studying.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.069
- Look, this girl just ate
part of a dead monkey.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.811
- Why are your books
in the trash?

31:40.855 --> 31:43.945
- I think it's a foot
or a thigh or something,

31:43.989 --> 31:45.077
but now she can't stop pooping.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.513
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:46.556 --> 31:47.993
They were just about
to airlift her out.

31:48.036 --> 31:49.342
- You have a test!

31:49.385 --> 31:51.431
- Can you relax?
It got called off.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.085
- By who?

31:53.128 --> 31:54.869
- Me.
- Why?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.392
- Because I'm just not ready.

31:56.436 --> 31:58.960
- You've been studying
for months.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.354
- Look, it's my life, okay?

32:03.095 --> 32:06.098
- Fine.
- Great.

32:07.447 --> 32:10.580
- If you're done, so am I.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.408
- Well--well,
what does that mean?

32:12.452 --> 32:14.628
- I'm not ready either.

32:15.281 --> 32:18.893
- Wha--hey, hey, hey.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.330
What--dah-dah-dah--
Do not.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.506
- "Lord of the Flies"
essay is in here.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.421
- Didn't you back it up?
- Handwritten.

32:25.465 --> 32:27.467
- No.
- Biology book.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.948
No more boring homework
about chloroplasts.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.253
- That is like
half your grade.

32:31.297 --> 32:32.428
- Who needs it?

32:32.472 --> 32:33.777
I'll just work
at the mini mart.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.257
- That is not happening.

32:35.301 --> 32:37.825
- Why not?
Good enough for you.

34:26.586 --> 34:30.807

34:35.029 --> 34:38.250
the grassy knoll,
book depository--

34:38.293 --> 34:41.166
so many theories,
so much confusion

34:41.209 --> 34:43.255
about where

35:01.011 --> 35:02.622

35:08.062 --> 35:09.455
What am I looking at?

35:09.498 --> 35:12.675
- Confusion.

35:17.332 --> 35:19.247

37:39.996 --> 37:45.088

37:51.530 --> 37:54.272
- Took you long enough.
- Where is she?

37:56.012 --> 37:57.449
- Well,
couple of options here--

37:57.492 --> 37:59.146
you keep taking it
until you pass

37:59.189 --> 38:02.758
or move to West Virginia
and work the coal mines.

38:02.802 --> 38:03.977
If you bring your own helmet,

38:04.020 --> 38:06.414
I hear they hire you
on the spot.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.810
- They said I tested
on the high end

38:10.853 --> 38:12.768
for a sixth-grader.

38:12.812 --> 38:14.770
- At least it was
on the high end.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.294
- You can go now.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.819
- Right, get up.
- Pass.

38:19.862 --> 38:22.343
- You're coming with me.
- Where?

38:23.953 --> 38:25.738
- Field trip.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.827
Just 'cause I'm British
doesn't mean I play darts...

38:27.870 --> 38:29.089
- Are you sure?

38:29.132 --> 38:31.221
- Or cricket or rowing
or rugby or--

38:31.265 --> 38:33.398
- Oh, oh, of course not
because you don't have any time

38:33.441 --> 38:35.138
'cause you're always
out on a fox hunt.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.836
- I don't go on fox hunts!

38:36.879 --> 38:38.316
- I'm scared of horses.

38:38.359 --> 38:39.621
- Are you really?
- Yeah.

38:39.665 --> 38:43.408
- Ah, I wish I had
a good therapist to give you.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.279
- Outrageous.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.194
- How dare you?
How dare you?

38:47.237 --> 38:49.283
- You walked right into it.
- Yeah .

38:52.678 --> 38:56.377
God, I just--I feel so dumb.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.161
- I know.

38:58.205 --> 39:01.295
- I really, really tried.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.036
- That's how you know
you're not dumb.

39:04.298 --> 39:05.995
- That makes no sense at all.

39:06.039 --> 39:08.128
- I hoped you were too dumb
to realize that.

39:08.171 --> 39:09.956
Shut up.

39:12.175 --> 39:16.571
- I mean, I wasted
so much time studying.

39:16.615 --> 39:19.531
- Yeah, I mean, not that much.
You did fail.

39:19.574 --> 39:23.491
- Like, I know that a logarithm
is an exponent,

39:23.535 --> 39:26.712
and I know the difference
between a trope and a bromide,

39:26.755 --> 39:28.801
and all the republics
of Russia.

39:28.844 --> 39:30.324
And for what?

39:30.368 --> 39:31.847
- Well, if you can
spell Chechnya,

39:31.891 --> 39:34.284
that drink's on me.

39:34.328 --> 39:36.243
- I thought it already was.
- No stalling.

39:37.723 --> 39:38.941
- Okay.

39:38.985 --> 39:39.899
It's no problem.
- Mm.

39:39.942 --> 39:42.380
- It's, you know, C...

39:44.469 --> 39:47.123
"Ech" N-Y-A.

39:47.167 --> 39:50.170
- "Ech" is not a letter
in any language.

39:50.213 --> 39:53.565
- Well, that's what
autocorrect is for, so...

40:03.792 --> 40:05.228
- I, um...

40:06.360 --> 40:08.449
I proposed to Lila...

40:10.625 --> 40:13.149
Couple of nights ago.

40:16.065 --> 40:17.676
- Congrats.

40:24.073 --> 40:26.424
- I should go.

40:28.121 --> 40:30.210
- It's fine.
I got mine.

40:34.954 --> 40:37.086
Couldn't spell it.

40:54.843 --> 40:56.628
- Hey.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.194
- Hey.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.156
Where are the kids?

41:03.199 --> 41:05.419
- You know what?
I have no idea.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.638
- Dean.

41:06.681 --> 41:09.510
- I mean, they're
here somewhere, I just--

41:09.554 --> 41:11.381
- Hopefully alive.

41:11.425 --> 41:15.734
- I've just been in this.

41:15.777 --> 41:20.608
Welcome to Boland Bubbles.

41:24.220 --> 41:27.180
- I'm not really in the market.
I'm just browsing.

41:27.223 --> 41:29.356
- Oh, well, as you look around,

41:29.399 --> 41:32.359
keep in mind
none of this is to scale.

41:32.402 --> 41:36.711
Blue Legos are two-seaters,
red, four-seaters,

41:36.755 --> 41:39.758
and green are eight-seaters.

41:39.801 --> 41:43.675
Let me know if you wanna
try something out.

41:43.718 --> 41:45.546
- You're gonna be great.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.200
- Hey, Beth...

41:57.732 --> 42:01.562

the police report on our kids.

42:14.793 --> 42:16.969

They got nothing
in their bank accounts.

42:25.630 --> 42:26.631

42:27.980 --> 42:29.416
some of the best fake money
I've ever seen.

42:29.459 --> 42:31.418
You don't live a little?

42:31.461 --> 42:34.508

a car for cash.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.598

What kind?

42:37.642 --> 42:39.948

not one she can afford.
