You may not know me.
I'm Big Enos Burdette.

00:42.447 --> 00:44.689
This is my son, Little Enos.

00:45.158 --> 00:47.501
Believe me, you put
Enos Burdette in

00:47.502 --> 00:49.654
the capitol building in Austin...

00:49.996 --> 00:52.950
Holy... Is that who I think it is?

00:53.250 --> 00:56.785
If that ain't John Coen, then
I'm the Incredible Hulk.

01:38.796 --> 01:42.130
You better. You only raised $80
at that last benefit dinner.

01:42.217 --> 01:44.708
I delivered the Statler
Brothers, didn't I?

01:48.140 --> 01:49.302
Are you ready, Son?

01:49.391 --> 01:52.926
Nobody shit-bombs a Burdette
and gets away with it.

01:53.020 --> 01:55.558
I'll tell you one thing.
When I'm elected governor...

01:55.647 --> 01:57.806
I'm gonna pass a law that
damn fools like that...

01:57.900 --> 01:59.726
can't fly over other
people's property.

Enos Burdette, your fat ass will
not warm the governor's chair...

02:20.257 --> 02:22.712
if I have to spend every
goddamn dime I got.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.845
Candidates for governor of Texas?

02:30.142 --> 02:33.344
Why don't you boys try something
a little more your size?

02:33.436 --> 02:37.434
If I had my choice, I'd endorse
one of the Dallas cheerleaders...

02:37.524 --> 02:40.015

either one of you...

02:40.653 --> 02:42.027
turkeys.

02:42.738 --> 02:45.027
Now, get out of my sight.

02:56.502 --> 02:57.533
What is it?

02:57.628 --> 02:59.206
It's Silisbey, Governor.

02:59.297 --> 03:02.962
Silisbey, I told you before.
I will now tell you again.

That crate is a very special gift
from me to the Grand Old Party.

03:24.531 --> 03:27.616
It'll be your ass if
it's not there in time.

03:28.493 --> 03:32.112
Just get me crate number 1444.

03:33.040 --> 03:38.082

- Where we going, Daddy? And why?

03:38.170 --> 03:41.040

but if you can hold them burger
bits down for one more lap...

05:07.220 --> 05:09.546
me and you gonna
be $20,000 richer.

05:10.223 --> 05:13.010
On to the white flag,
with one lap to go.

05:37.585 --> 05:39.993
Coming down. Look at
that straight away.

05:40.338 --> 05:42.129
Look at that.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.764
Truck's demolished, but
he's gonna walk away.

06:00.859 --> 06:02.650
Looks like he's all right.

06:03.528 --> 06:05.651
Big Iron coming
down to the finish.

All bunched up and coming
down to the finish line...

06:12.203 --> 06:15.039
your winner will
be Cledus Snowman.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.960
Fred, did you ever see
a check that big? I'm

06:26.961 --> 06:29.176
gonna use that and
get you a face-lift.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.971
Snowman, see you a minute?

06:33.392 --> 06:36.179
Folks, I want you to meet
Big Wart and Little Wart.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.855
You be careful, Snowman. Us
Burdettes don't take kindly...

06:40.941 --> 06:42.816
to a slur on our family name.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.939
I'm sorry. I thought you two was
a slur on your family name.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.440
Snowman, we didn't
come here to fight.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.194
He's smarter than
he looks, ain't he?

06:51.285 --> 06:52.631
Look, we got us a business

06:52.632 --> 06:54.702
proposition. We gotta
find the Bandit.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.663
I figured you was
looking for the Bandit.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.244
You know where he is?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.411
That depends on how hard
somebody's looking for him.

07:00.504 --> 07:05.000
- We're looking mighty hard.
- I mean hard, like in hard cash.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.176
$100,000? US?

07:09.180 --> 07:11.146
You want his phone
number, MasterCharge

07:11.147 --> 07:13.260
number or the colour
of his Jockey shorts?

07:13.350 --> 07:14.975
I mean, I can...

07:15.060 --> 07:17.216
You don't have to take my picture.

07:17.217 --> 07:19.688
I'll go home and sit
on your dresser.

07:19.774 --> 07:22.265
Look, time's a-wasting
here, Snowman.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.479
You want to breed or
listen to my proposition?

07:26.322 --> 07:28.085
Bring Fred, the truck and anything

07:28.086 --> 07:30.107
else that looks nice
down to the pit.

07:30.202 --> 07:32.256
I appreciate you two
dropping by and

07:32.257 --> 07:34.033
trashing up my moment of glory.

07:34.122 --> 07:35.995
You want the money or the glory?

07:36.082 --> 07:38.655
I'd like to have them both,
but I got this problem.

07:38.751 --> 07:41.871
Let me guess. You don't
know where the Bandit is?

07:41.963 --> 07:44.834
We got us a winner. Yeah,
my mind went blank.

07:44.925 --> 07:47.630
Let me jiggle your memory
bank a little bit.

07:47.719 --> 07:49.094
$200,000?

07:50.222 --> 07:52.345
Well, the clouds are
parting a little.

07:52.432 --> 07:54.386
$200,000. You take it or leave it.

07:54.387 --> 07:56.762
Would you believe I
just got total recall?

07:56.853 --> 07:59.304
Here's the deal. You
go down and pick

07:59.305 --> 08:01.562
up this package on a Miami dock...

08:02.067 --> 08:04.475
and deliver it to the
governor of Texas.

08:04.570 --> 08:06.528
- The governor of Texas?
- That's right.

08:06.614 --> 08:08.274
Strictly legit.

08:08.366 --> 08:11.236
- And you're Wilt Chamberlain.
- That's right.

08:11.327 --> 08:15.574
Listen, this whole thing is legal.
I'll stake my reputation on that.

08:15.665 --> 08:17.123
His, too.

08:18.793 --> 08:21.345
That makes me feel a
whole lot better.

08:21.346 --> 08:23.336
There's one thing bothers us.

08:23.715 --> 08:27.167
We heard talk of the
Bandit slipping.

08:27.260 --> 08:31.210
"Gone into the shithouse" is
the exact phrase we heard.

08:31.306 --> 08:34.722
May I tell you boys something?
He is in better shape now...

08:34.809 --> 08:36.967
than he's ever been in
his life, trust me.

09:18.354 --> 09:19.729
Hey, Bo.

09:25.153 --> 09:27.027
Bo, you all right?

09:28.448 --> 09:30.820
Cledus, you've gotten taller.

09:30.909 --> 09:34.195
Yes, and you've gotten drunker.
This place looks like a shithouse.

09:34.288 --> 09:36.779
- Want to sit down? Sit there.
- Come on, Bo.

09:36.874 --> 09:38.950
What've you got on? Come on, here.

09:40.086 --> 09:42.755
- Is that you, Cledus?
- Yeah, it's me.

09:42.838 --> 09:45.957
- You dropped my watch.
- I know it. Come here.

09:46.091 --> 09:47.502
Sit down.

09:48.177 --> 09:50.964
- Your timing is just rotten.
- Look.

09:52.682 --> 09:57.509
I'm gonna make us a lot
of money. $200,000. Look.

09:59.271 --> 10:01.099
$200,000.

10:01.191 --> 10:05.022
Big and Little Enos are out
there, and they got $200,000.

10:05.111 --> 10:08.646
I need you to be straight for
three minutes. Can you manage...

10:08.740 --> 10:10.898
That's good enough. Come on.

10:11.535 --> 10:14.108
Come here. $200,000.

10:14.204 --> 10:17.738
But you've got to be straight for
two minutes. That's all I need.

10:17.832 --> 10:19.908
Want a picture of me?
Only 50 cents apiece.

10:20.001 --> 10:21.710
- You can have one for nothing.
- Hello.

10:21.795 --> 10:26.042
Fellows. No. Get back in here.

10:26.633 --> 10:29.754
When we get in there,
let me do the talking.

10:31.013 --> 10:33.338
Okay, fellows. Come on in.

10:39.522 --> 10:42.772
Now, he's meditating.
Don't talk to him much.

10:43.275 --> 10:46.110
Don't run off, Bandit.
This is a sweet deal.

10:46.195 --> 10:50.276
$200,000 just to bring a package
from Florida to Dallas.

10:53.577 --> 10:55.950
That's what I said: $200,000.

10:59.918 --> 11:01.791
I don't think he's interested.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.579
What does it take to
keep this man erect?

11:04.580 --> 11:06.421
A different set of figures.

11:07.217 --> 11:09.256
How much more do you want?

11:13.014 --> 11:15.684
Four. $400,000.

11:16.602 --> 11:18.428
You got it. Is it a deal?

11:21.273 --> 11:23.431
I'll check with him.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.278
- Got a deal.
- Okay. Don't get up, Bandit.

11:30.365 --> 11:32.654
I gotta go now, but I'll
see you back in Texas.

11:32.743 --> 11:35.128
And here's the
number of the crate.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.195
Wait a minute.

11:37.748 --> 11:40.204
He wants to say something else.

11:42.211 --> 11:43.409
Right.

11:45.006 --> 11:47.141
If he doesn't get
at least half the

11:47.142 --> 11:49.217
money, he may become very violent.

11:49.302 --> 11:51.709
Give him the money, Little Enos.

11:58.186 --> 12:00.345
I'd like to kick
his ass just once.

12:00.439 --> 12:02.396
Come on. Let's go.

12:09.531 --> 12:12.366
He's overdue for a
good butt-kicking.

12:13.243 --> 12:14.702
Look at that.

12:14.786 --> 12:17.871
Do you realise we
can start a bank?

12:18.791 --> 12:22.491
That's more money than I've
seen in one time in my life.

12:28.217 --> 12:32.262
You're crying. We got the
money. What are you crying...

12:33.848 --> 12:37.098
I was just thinking about Frog.

12:42.065 --> 12:45.185
I really wish it could've
worked for you two.

12:47.028 --> 12:48.819
I'm ready.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.446
Don't hurt the money.

12:55.912 --> 12:57.786
I don't need anybody.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.197
Okay.

13:00.292 --> 13:04.241
You think I ain't ready, son?
You just watch my smoke.

13:09.176 --> 13:12.462
Daddy, come on. You're gonna
be late for my wedding.

13:19.645 --> 13:21.389
Sumbitch.

13:22.731 --> 13:26.267
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Good morning, nice lady.

13:26.903 --> 13:30.402
You must be mighty proud of
that wonderful son you got.

13:30.489 --> 13:32.234
Let me tell you something.

13:32.324 --> 13:35.491
Junior's nothing but a
big mound of tick turd.

13:35.870 --> 13:40.034
Imagine. Trying to marry that
floozy for a second time.

13:41.251 --> 13:45.000
You know, if Junior is able
to get up in the morning...

13:45.588 --> 13:48.126
tie his shoelaces
and take a pee...

13:48.216 --> 13:52.048
- I'm not proud. I'm amazed.
- I declare.

13:52.137 --> 13:56.004
I didn't realise this floozy was
the same one as the last one.

13:56.099 --> 13:58.130
But I do remember
all that trouble,

13:58.131 --> 14:00.049
that poor child being abducted...

14:00.145 --> 14:03.230
and taken off by that
handsome devil, Bandit.

14:16.496 --> 14:18.987
Sheriff, is that your
radio acting up?

14:19.082 --> 14:22.664
No, that ain't my radio. It's
my hemo-gauge that's beeping.

14:22.752 --> 14:25.457
This hemo-gauge and
that exercise...

14:25.546 --> 14:29.626
was invented in a monastery
by a couple of Tibetan monks.

14:30.051 --> 14:31.546
They live in Newark now.

14:31.636 --> 14:36.049
And just lucky enough, I saw the
advertisement in Screw magazine.

14:36.141 --> 14:39.344
So I sent away for
it. Cost me $19.95.

14:39.478 --> 14:41.082
That's just wonderful, Sheriff. I

14:41.083 --> 14:42.977
guess that makes it
easier for you...

14:43.064 --> 14:46.065
to deal with that business about
your daughter-in-law to be...

14:46.151 --> 14:50.611
running off with that
gorgeous, handsome Bandit.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.195
Daddy?

14:59.290 --> 15:01.615
Come on. You're gonna be late.

15:03.294 --> 15:04.954
Sumbitch.

15:05.922 --> 15:09.705
My dear friends, you have come
together in this church...

15:09.800 --> 15:12.671
so that the Lord may seal
and strengthen your love.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.424
Excuse me.

15:18.935 --> 15:20.180
Hello?

15:20.436 --> 15:22.476
But, sir, this is a wedding.

15:22.563 --> 15:24.686
All right, just a moment.

15:26.276 --> 15:28.601
It's for the bride-to-be.
It's long distance.

15:28.695 --> 15:29.940
Carrie?

15:30.697 --> 15:32.191
It's for you.

15:33.074 --> 15:35.447
Junior, I don't think I
should take it right now.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.323
You gotta take it.
It's long distance.

15:38.622 --> 15:39.902
Right.

15:45.128 --> 15:46.374
Hello?

15:47.590 --> 15:49.167
Yes, it is.

15:49.842 --> 15:52.380
Cledus, hi. How are you?

15:52.470 --> 15:54.261
I'm good.

15:54.347 --> 15:57.348
Look, Cledus, I'm a
little busy right now.

15:57.934 --> 15:59.677
Who's in trouble?

16:00.811 --> 16:02.935
Oh, him.

16:03.022 --> 16:05.229
Yeah, sure. I remember him.

16:06.359 --> 16:07.557
Help?

16:09.153 --> 16:11.111
Why should I help him?

16:11.489 --> 16:13.233
What good reason?

16:13.533 --> 16:16.155
$50,000? That's a good reason.

16:16.577 --> 16:19.863
Yeah, right. I'll be right there.

16:22.709 --> 16:25.461
Junior, do you love me?

16:25.545 --> 16:28.167
- Sure, Carrie.
- Good.

16:28.757 --> 16:31.675
Because maybe then you'll
understand and you'll wait for me.

16:31.761 --> 16:34.174
When I get back, I'll
have enough money for

16:34.175 --> 16:36.422
that brand new milking
machine you want.

16:36.515 --> 16:39.884
Good. And maybe someday
we can buy a cow.

16:40.602 --> 16:41.883
Right.

16:45.524 --> 16:46.935
Not again.

16:51.030 --> 16:54.066
Now, just where do you
think you're going?

16:54.909 --> 16:56.783
The Bandit needs me.

17:00.081 --> 17:02.751
And you better
recharge your beeper.

17:15.806 --> 17:18.972
Damn. I thought I was
supposed to go with her.

17:20.602 --> 17:23.175
Well, I said it before...

17:24.065 --> 17:26.436
and I'm gonna say it again.

17:26.608 --> 17:31.650
There ain't no way that you
could come from my loins.

17:32.739 --> 17:35.990
I'm going home and kick
your mama in the butt.

17:37.202 --> 17:41.035
- Okay, where's the rest of it?
- You found them all, Massa.

17:49.007 --> 17:50.122
Yeah.

17:50.216 --> 17:53.715
You know what I think about
your big training program?

17:53.803 --> 17:56.101
J-O-A-K, joke.
That's what I think.

17:56.102 --> 17:58.097
I'm in better shape every day.

17:58.182 --> 18:00.288
If Big Enos could
ship that package of

18:00.289 --> 18:02.394
his to Texas behind
a team of mules...

18:02.479 --> 18:04.139
it'd beat us at the
rate we're going.

18:04.230 --> 18:06.900
Just because I started shaking,
you're falling to pieces.

18:06.983 --> 18:09.771
Shaking? You've got
the DTs so bad...

18:09.861 --> 18:12.531
you could thread a sewing
machine with it running.

18:12.614 --> 18:13.894
Thanks. I'll take that.

18:13.990 --> 18:16.232
I don't know why you sent
for her. I don't need her.

18:16.326 --> 18:18.319
You don't need anybody,
but she's coming.

18:18.412 --> 18:20.820
Why don't you admit
you're glad she's coming?

18:20.915 --> 18:23.584
You'll need all the help you
can get to get in shape...

18:23.709 --> 18:25.749
to make this run, anyway.

18:27.504 --> 18:29.627
Well, that's about enough.

18:29.715 --> 18:31.293
- How many is that?
- One.

18:31.384 --> 18:34.302
- You did one yesterday.
- I know, and it hurt.

18:34.387 --> 18:37.423
Do you think maybe you could
squeeze two out of your body...

18:37.515 --> 18:40.385
- without having a coronary?
- I could try.

18:42.353 --> 18:45.307
She never was that much
of a help, anyway.

18:47.525 --> 18:50.479
I just figured out why
my album didn't sell.

18:50.570 --> 18:52.610
It was the wrong
selection of material:

18:52.697 --> 18:54.821
- The Bandit Sings Cole Porter.
- Listen.

18:54.908 --> 18:58.193
If you think the girl was having
a good time, look at that.

18:58.286 --> 19:00.445
Hell, she had to get
in line to see you.

19:00.538 --> 19:02.496
She left me when the
going got tough.

19:02.583 --> 19:03.697
Hold it.

19:03.792 --> 19:06.828
I distinctly remember that
when the going got good...

19:06.920 --> 19:09.162
it was Bo's big ego that
busted everything up.

19:09.256 --> 19:12.672
Remember what I told you? I said,
"If you ever lose that girl...

19:12.760 --> 19:15.381
"you're gonna wind up being a
booze-head ex-superstar...

19:15.471 --> 19:17.801
"and every time you
come up for air,

19:17.802 --> 19:20.382
you'll have a can of
beer in your hand."

19:20.601 --> 19:22.890
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah?

19:23.354 --> 19:25.228
Would you... Give me the beer.

19:25.314 --> 19:27.354
You're gonna keep
drinking that stuff...

19:27.441 --> 19:30.645
your belly's the size of
a number ten washtub.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.057
You know what? I
hope I'm there when

19:34.058 --> 19:36.152
they do the autopsy
on your butt...

19:36.242 --> 19:39.942
because your kidneys gotta look
like the air cleaner on a KW.

19:40.037 --> 19:42.681
Besides, me and you
together couldn't scrape

19:42.682 --> 19:44.913
up six people to be
your pallbearers.

19:45.001 --> 19:47.788
That's a long walk
to make by your...

19:52.301 --> 19:54.507
Somebody left this up here.

19:57.598 --> 19:59.507
I'm gonna put it back.

20:06.690 --> 20:08.433
Bo, she's here.

20:50.694 --> 20:52.852
- Hi, Frog.
- Hi, Bandit.

20:54.865 --> 20:57.154
- You're shaking.
- I'm cold.

20:58.994 --> 21:02.245
I thought maybe you were
nervous about seeing me again.

21:02.331 --> 21:03.659
I'm cold.

21:04.208 --> 21:08.252
It's been a long time since I've
seen you, six or seven months.

21:08.337 --> 21:09.666
I don't know.

21:09.755 --> 21:12.004
It's more like eight
months, four days, and

21:12.005 --> 21:14.049
six and a half hours,
but I'm not sure.

21:14.844 --> 21:17.513
After we broke up,
where did you go?

21:18.056 --> 21:20.013
- To pieces.
- Yeah?

21:20.099 --> 21:21.926
And then I went to New York.

21:22.018 --> 21:23.871
I started dancing
again. I got this

21:23.872 --> 21:25.518
fabulous job in a rock musical.

21:25.605 --> 21:28.310
Is that where you
got those clothes?

21:29.025 --> 21:30.740
What's wrong with these clothes?

21:30.741 --> 21:32.809
Nothing, if you're
in a rock musical.

21:32.904 --> 21:37.068
I wouldn't talk if I were you. You
look like "The Gay Caballero."

21:38.869 --> 21:42.617
- Let's not fight.
- I don't want to fight, either.

21:42.706 --> 21:44.579
Miss Frog, remember me?

21:44.666 --> 21:45.947
Cledus.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.289
You skinny old bone.

21:48.379 --> 21:51.048
My God, the man has no
meat on him whatsoever.

21:51.131 --> 21:53.801
You ever seen a fat
racehorse, mama?

21:54.093 --> 21:56.282
Do you know how
glad I am to see...

21:56.283 --> 21:57.283
Hey.

21:58.347 --> 22:01.514
- What is this?
- Cledus, you didn't tell him?

22:01.601 --> 22:04.270
No. Frog, I forgot.

22:07.106 --> 22:10.724
I was getting all set to marry
Junior again when I got your call.

22:10.818 --> 22:12.934
You didn't waste much
time dilly-dallying

22:12.935 --> 22:14.899
around with another
bunch of people...

22:14.990 --> 22:16.187
did you, once we broke up?

22:16.282 --> 22:19.200
You were dilly-dallying around
when we were still together.

22:19.285 --> 22:22.370
Hey, kids. Will you
just knock it off?

22:22.455 --> 22:26.039
The important thing is we're
back together again, right?

22:27.168 --> 22:29.624
Yeah, he's right.

22:30.589 --> 22:33.127
Let me make myself
perfectly clear.

22:33.217 --> 22:36.467
While there is a certain amount of
physical attraction between us...

22:36.554 --> 22:39.045
and even some residual
affection, due to nostalgia...

22:39.140 --> 22:41.809
my one and only reason for being
here is money. M-O-N-E-Y.

22:41.892 --> 22:45.308
So let's get started whipping
your ass into shape.

22:47.481 --> 22:48.976
She still loves me.

24:30.338 --> 24:34.002
Damned if you ain't ready for
the Kentucky Derby, son.

24:35.635 --> 24:38.838
Forty-eight. We ain't
got but four days left.

24:38.930 --> 24:40.210
Forty-nine.

24:40.890 --> 24:42.170
Fifty.

24:42.391 --> 24:44.265
Texas is a long ways.

24:48.106 --> 24:50.229
You're getting pretty good.

24:50.316 --> 24:52.522
I got to quit this soon...

24:52.610 --> 24:56.026
or I'm gonna end up looking
like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

24:56.114 --> 24:57.905
I'm glad we're gonna
get out of here.

24:57.991 --> 25:00.612
I'm afraid this luxurious
lifestyle is gonna grow on me.

25:00.702 --> 25:04.071
Slight problem there. I
ain't got no wheels.

25:05.165 --> 25:08.830
I'm the only man in the world
that drank up a Trans-Am.

25:09.044 --> 25:12.045
Can you imagine Roy Rogers
selling Trigger for a six-pack?

25:12.131 --> 25:13.209
No.

25:13.298 --> 25:16.252
- Think he's ready, mama?
- I think he's ready.

25:16.343 --> 25:18.808
You see, we have got
a surprise for you.

25:18.809 --> 25:19.809
What?

25:19.810 --> 25:22.758
- We've got a surprise for you.
- Yes, big surprise.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.778
If you will just
kindly step outside.

25:24.779 --> 25:25.887
Right outside, here.

25:25.978 --> 25:29.264
We got something we'd like
to show you. Come on.

25:33.027 --> 25:34.605
Son of Trigger.

25:37.323 --> 25:39.150
You shouldn't have done that.

25:39.241 --> 25:41.282
Pretty, ain't it? I didn't
do it all by myself.

25:41.369 --> 25:43.362
- Mama helped me a little.
- What did you do?

25:43.455 --> 25:45.827
I traded Junior's car in on it.

25:50.587 --> 25:52.413
- Black is beautiful.
- Expensive, too.

25:52.505 --> 25:54.463
- But worth it.
- Yeah.

25:54.550 --> 25:56.257
Where was that you
said we were going?

25:56.343 --> 25:58.718
Where do you think we need to go?

25:58.719 --> 25:59.719
Miami.

27:18.135 --> 27:21.718
just driving along at
old double nickel.

27:21.806 --> 27:25.140
Maybe he doesn't know who
the legendary Bandit is.

27:25.727 --> 27:26.758
Doubtful.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.937
I'm what you call
your "basic famous."

27:30.023 --> 27:32.265
- "Basic famous."
- Bandit.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.891
Hey, Bandit. Hi.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.969
Gotta be careful of
women like that.

27:38.970 --> 27:39.970
Yeah?

27:39.971 --> 27:41.906
They start off, they just
want your autograph.

27:41.993 --> 27:45.197
Next, they wanna tear your clothes
off. Then they want your body.

27:45.289 --> 27:46.289
You're kidding?

27:46.290 --> 27:48.243
No, I wouldn't kid about
a thing like that.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.872
You don't joke about people
taking your clothes off.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.287
No. Golly, it must be hard.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.843
- What?
- Being a superstar.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.799
I'll tell you something.
Sometimes it's hell.

27:59.887 --> 28:01.512
- Is it?
- Yeah.

28:01.597 --> 28:04.267
I don't know. You
feel like a freak.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.761
Probably.

28:07.395 --> 28:09.767
You know, I've been thinking...

28:10.064 --> 28:13.065
and I'd rather just
have your autograph.

28:13.150 --> 28:16.317
- As opposed to what?
- Ripping your clothes off.

28:16.404 --> 28:17.567
Why?

28:18.155 --> 28:21.322
I've seen you with your
clothes off, remember?

28:22.327 --> 28:24.236
Of course I remember.

28:24.621 --> 28:26.495
It ain't no big deal.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.828
I swear I'm gonna
break the camera,

28:39.829 --> 28:41.799
with my hair in rollers like this.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.964
Hell, it's worth it...

28:44.057 --> 28:46.844
getting your picture took
with a living legend.

28:46.935 --> 28:51.016
- Bo, it's awful hot out here.
- I'll be right with you, honey.

28:51.107 --> 28:52.980
Take your time. I
understand completely.

28:53.067 --> 28:55.772
I think I'd like one of those
pictures for myself...

28:55.862 --> 28:58.435
wallet-size, with a glossy
finish, the scalloped edges.

28:58.531 --> 29:00.607
I wanna remember
this moment forever.

29:00.700 --> 29:02.573
Hold still. Say "cheese."

29:02.660 --> 29:04.736
- Cheese.
- Thank you.

29:06.039 --> 29:07.865
- Bye, gals.
- Thanks.

29:08.750 --> 29:10.541
I could die right here.

29:10.626 --> 29:12.702
- Bye.
- Bye, Bandit.

29:28.770 --> 29:31.440
- Howdy.
- What do you boys need?

29:31.523 --> 29:36.232
We're here to pick up a crate.
Do you have a crate number 1444?

29:36.319 --> 29:37.600
Got it right here.

29:37.696 --> 29:41.148
Right in between number 1443...

29:41.241 --> 29:43.911
- and 1445.
- Good place.

29:44.662 --> 29:47.449
You want to go down to the
first building on the right...

29:47.540 --> 29:48.821
and hook a left.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.324
- First dock on the left.
- Right.

29:52.128 --> 29:55.287
No, left. You wanna
go down here...

29:55.288 --> 29:56.340
Sir?

29:56.424 --> 29:58.464
That's all right. We'll
find it. Thank you.

29:58.551 --> 30:01.755
Okay, that's all
right. Hold it, boys.

30:02.597 --> 30:04.341
I can't let you take that crate.

30:04.433 --> 30:07.138
- What do you mean?
- I just checked my records...

30:07.227 --> 30:10.678
and that crate's quarantined
for another three weeks.

30:10.772 --> 30:14.022
Quarantined? You mean, the crate's
got the measles or something?

30:14.109 --> 30:15.389
You gotta be kidding.

30:15.485 --> 30:18.058
Ain't no place in the security
business for kidding.

30:18.154 --> 30:20.265
Just hold on there
a minute, chief.

30:20.266 --> 30:22.200
Let me explain something to you.

30:22.284 --> 30:25.617
We have to have that crate
in Texas in three days.

30:27.415 --> 30:30.474
Hell, I suppose you
could take the crate.

30:30.475 --> 30:31.494
Great.

30:31.585 --> 30:34.274
But it's just that
you'll have to leave

30:34.275 --> 30:36.627
what's in it here for three weeks.

30:38.550 --> 30:42.549
As I told you, it's been
quarantined for three weeks.

30:49.103 --> 30:51.594
Bo, would you keep your
hands to yourself?

30:53.149 --> 30:56.400
Hurry up. The sun's coming up.

30:56.612 --> 30:58.757
Creeping around in
a warehouse. We're

30:58.758 --> 31:01.072
going to jail, that's
where we're going.

31:01.158 --> 31:03.731
- I'm going home.
- Turn the damn light on.

31:03.827 --> 31:05.903
- I ain't got the light.
- I got it.

31:05.996 --> 31:08.238
Give me the light, would you?

31:08.331 --> 31:10.288
- Find the number.
- I can't get...

31:10.417 --> 31:12.024
Is burglary always this much fun?

31:12.025 --> 31:13.453
Find the number on the crate.

31:13.545 --> 31:17.080
I'm looking. There ain't no
numbers. Here's a number.

31:17.174 --> 31:19.416
- "1442."
- All right. We're getting close.

31:19.510 --> 31:20.838
Come on.

31:21.554 --> 31:24.887
Wait, here. "1445." We're hot.

31:24.974 --> 31:27.892
- Well, it's gotta be...
- Hey, here it is.

31:27.976 --> 31:30.349
- "1443."
- Give me that.

31:30.438 --> 31:33.972
"1443." "1445."

31:34.066 --> 31:35.970
You see, 1444 should
be right here.

31:35.971 --> 31:36.971
Bo?

31:38.154 --> 31:40.480
- What?
- Shine the light up there.

31:44.577 --> 31:48.160
"1444."

31:49.916 --> 31:52.917
Oh, shit.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.749
You mind telling me how come they
paint the number of our crate...

31:57.841 --> 31:59.667
up here on the side
of the building?

31:59.759 --> 32:02.926
Well, it's a crate
acting like a building.

32:03.013 --> 32:04.756
I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

32:04.848 --> 32:06.683
You wanna tell me
something? How we

32:06.684 --> 32:08.467
gonna get that thing on the truck?

32:08.560 --> 32:10.901
Have you seen the
size of this crate?

32:10.902 --> 32:11.902
Yeah.

32:12.648 --> 32:14.889
It's gonna take one
hell of a forklift.

32:14.983 --> 32:17.440
Tell you right now, I won't
be able to keep up my end.

32:17.527 --> 32:20.091
Enos said it would
fit in the truck.

32:20.092 --> 32:22.654
The man's a chronic
liar. I'm alone.

32:23.701 --> 32:26.572
- Listen, hold the light.
- Hold the light?

32:27.497 --> 32:29.869
For goodness' sake.
It's just a crate.

32:46.182 --> 32:47.428
Shamu.

32:53.232 --> 32:55.189
Let's go check for the bones.

32:55.859 --> 32:57.935
Probably broken every
bone in his body.

32:58.028 --> 32:59.142
Hey, Bo?

33:03.993 --> 33:06.199
Come on. Quite a ride, huh?

33:06.537 --> 33:08.486
She caught me off
guard, or I would've

33:08.487 --> 33:10.036
rode her the full ten seconds.

33:10.124 --> 33:14.751
Bo, that was incredible. You saved
my life. It was totally unselfish.

33:15.254 --> 33:18.089
It weren't nothing. I saw the
elephant coming for you...

33:18.174 --> 33:21.009
so I jumped in front of you,
pulled you out of the way...

33:21.093 --> 33:23.382
The elephant hurt her foot.

33:23.471 --> 33:25.878
- Then the elephant what?
- I'm sorry.

33:25.973 --> 33:27.477
Look. She hurt her foot.

33:27.478 --> 33:29.675
Who gives a turkey about her foot?

33:29.769 --> 33:31.263
I could've broke my back in there.

33:31.354 --> 33:32.469
Sweetheart.

33:32.564 --> 33:34.438
- You hurt her foot.
- I didn't.

33:34.524 --> 33:35.556
You did.

33:35.650 --> 33:37.771
All it was, was this
little splinter

33:37.772 --> 33:39.434
which was stuck in her foot.

33:40.572 --> 33:41.603
Easy, girl.

33:41.698 --> 33:43.737
- Cute couple, aren't they?
- Yeah, they are.

33:43.825 --> 33:47.408
Kind of reminds me of my Aunt
Charlotte. Smells like her, too.

33:47.496 --> 33:48.576
How rude.

33:48.663 --> 33:50.870
Now, Charlotte, don't you
listen to any of that.

33:50.958 --> 33:52.915
Now that you've got a
hold of Charlotte...

33:53.002 --> 33:55.671
I don't have a hold of
Charlotte. She's got hold of me.

33:55.755 --> 33:58.080
Whatever. Why don't you
both mosey to the truck...

33:58.174 --> 34:00.499
get on, we'll get out, and
won't get into trouble.

34:00.593 --> 34:02.550
Let go of me, Charlotte.

34:02.636 --> 34:04.096
Thank you.

34:04.180 --> 34:07.631
- Open the door, Cledus.
- Okay. I'd like to see this.

34:07.725 --> 34:12.185
I'm coming, too. I'm behind
the whole troop here.

34:12.271 --> 34:14.099
Bringing up the rear, so to speak.

34:14.190 --> 34:17.559
Move out. Move it out.
Come on, Charlotte.

34:17.652 --> 34:19.277
Come on.

34:20.697 --> 34:22.487
Steady.

34:24.909 --> 34:26.783
Now, let's see here.

34:31.333 --> 34:33.076
You got any ideas?

34:33.460 --> 34:34.918
Well?

34:35.712 --> 34:39.377
Sure. I could just tell
Charlotte to get in the truck.

34:39.466 --> 34:41.375
- Good.
- Do that.

34:42.844 --> 34:45.597
Charlotte, get in the truck.

34:45.681 --> 34:48.219
Go on. Get in your house.

34:48.309 --> 34:51.891
Come on. Get in your house.
Good girl. That's a girl.

34:53.938 --> 34:57.355
How the heck are we ever
gonna get her out of there?

34:58.403 --> 35:01.190
I'm just gonna tell
her to turn around.

35:02.365 --> 35:05.532
He's just gonna talk a
little elephant there.

35:05.827 --> 35:09.030
Charlotte, turn around. Come on.

35:09.997 --> 35:13.117
Turn around, babe. Come on. Yeah.

35:19.966 --> 35:23.002
I can turn them on, but
I can't turn them off.

35:38.151 --> 35:39.231
Hi, Buford.

35:39.320 --> 35:42.107
Hello, you handsome sumbitch.

35:42.615 --> 35:43.895
Hi, Junior.

35:43.991 --> 35:46.446
- Hi, Carrie.
- Shut up, you shit.

35:47.244 --> 35:49.486
You barrel of monkey nuts.

35:51.248 --> 35:53.206
Well, as you can see, Bandit...

35:53.293 --> 35:55.700
I got my piece in my hand.

35:55.795 --> 35:59.543
- You got your what in your hand?
- Don't get funny, Bandit.

35:59.632 --> 36:02.337
If you make one move,
I'm gonna put a hole...

36:02.427 --> 36:05.344
right between those
gorgeous brown eyes.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.303
I don't think you're
that good a shot.

36:07.390 --> 36:08.968
Are you kidding?

36:09.059 --> 36:11.051
Do you realise that at one time...

36:11.144 --> 36:15.189
I won the marksmanship
championship award...

36:15.273 --> 36:18.274
from "Swollen Groin" Gatsell?

36:19.361 --> 36:20.736
I don't believe you.

36:20.821 --> 36:23.738
Do you see those three
lights over there?

36:23.991 --> 36:26.030
Watch this.

36:28.537 --> 36:30.197
That's pretty good shooting.

36:30.288 --> 36:32.697
But I'd really be convinced...

36:32.833 --> 36:36.284
if you could shoot that
weathervane over yonder.

36:36.378 --> 36:38.501
That's a baby-piss shot.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.922
That was good shooting.
I gotta admit that.

36:43.011 --> 36:46.426
Of course, them targets
weren't moving. Now...

36:46.514 --> 36:49.052
He's only got two more
shots. Give me the bottles.

36:49.141 --> 36:52.427
- Give me your gun, Junior.
- Just to make you feel at home...

36:52.520 --> 36:55.724
I'm gonna throw up a couple
of bottles of prune juice.

36:55.816 --> 36:58.982
We're running with a crazy
man. You know that?

37:03.240 --> 37:05.612
Are you convinced now?

37:05.701 --> 37:08.904
I'm convinced that you is
out of bullets. Bye-bye.

37:09.163 --> 37:10.657
Give me your gun.

37:10.747 --> 37:13.285
Hang onto your ass,
Fred. Here we go again.

37:36.816 --> 37:39.568
Why didn't you have
your gun loaded?

37:39.652 --> 37:43.068
When I put bullets in it,
Daddy, it gets too heavy.

37:44.741 --> 37:46.283
Shut your ass.

37:46.993 --> 37:49.698
And that goes for
the two monks, too.

37:50.539 --> 37:52.827
Do you see him anywhere?

37:52.916 --> 37:57.163
No, but he'll be along,
just like death and taxes.

37:59.297 --> 38:02.880
He didn't get away from
me. I let him escape.

38:03.510 --> 38:06.465
You see, what I'm doing
is playing with him...

38:06.554 --> 38:08.928
like a cat plays with a mouse.

38:10.017 --> 38:14.015
The mouse jumps this way,
and I grab him with my paw.

38:14.105 --> 38:17.936
The mouse jumps that way,
and I grab him with my paw.

38:18.359 --> 38:21.230
And then finally,
I squash his ass.

38:25.074 --> 38:26.948
- You're the Bandit, ain't you?
- Yeah.

38:27.035 --> 38:29.111
You're early, cowboy.
This is just a practise.

38:29.203 --> 38:30.483
Game isn't till tomorrow.

38:30.579 --> 38:33.664
We're big fans and wanna get good
seats. You with the Dolphins?

38:33.750 --> 38:37.285
No. I'm with the world
champion Pittsburgh Steelers.

38:37.504 --> 38:39.295
- Bradshaw with you?
- Of course.

38:39.381 --> 38:41.420
Coach doesn't let us go
anywhere without him.

38:41.508 --> 38:42.539
Thanks a lot.

38:56.481 --> 38:58.604
- Hi, Bandit, Frog.
- Hi, Terry.

38:58.692 --> 39:00.934
- I need a favour.
- You always do.

39:01.319 --> 39:03.250
You still got your
ranch in Shreveport?

39:03.251 --> 39:04.251
You bet.

39:04.252 --> 39:06.315
I don't have to tell
you who that is.

39:07.284 --> 39:08.862
Buford T. Justice.

39:08.953 --> 39:11.311
Could you hold him up for a while?

39:11.312 --> 39:12.312
Be glad to.

39:12.313 --> 39:13.998
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah?

39:14.917 --> 39:16.578
Tackle that car.

39:21.925 --> 39:24.546
- Thanks, Terry.
- You owe me, Bandit.

39:24.635 --> 39:27.044
Get out of there, you sumbitch...

39:27.139 --> 39:30.341
or you gonna have a penalty
flag hanging out of your ass.

39:30.433 --> 39:31.596
Really?

39:31.685 --> 39:33.724
- Hey, Daddy, that's...
- Shut up.

39:33.812 --> 39:36.932
I know how to handle
these bubble-butts.

39:37.023 --> 39:40.855
If you don't get out of the way,
I'm gonna run right over you.

39:40.944 --> 39:43.020
That's been tried before.

39:43.446 --> 39:47.908
But your possibility for
success is extremely remote.

39:47.993 --> 39:50.366
He's like all the other jocks:

39:50.579 --> 39:53.330
big, but dumb as a stump.

40:01.256 --> 40:06.381
I knew this would happen as soon
as they started that busing shit.

40:09.473 --> 40:11.679
Snowman, are you back there, son?

40:11.767 --> 40:13.926
My mirrors are empty...

40:14.228 --> 40:16.138
and so is my fuel tank.

40:16.231 --> 40:18.519
If we don't pull over and
get me some go-go juice...

40:18.608 --> 40:20.482
we gonna be in a heap of trouble.

40:20.568 --> 40:21.814
What do you think?

40:21.903 --> 40:24.987
If you're telling me you're out
of gas, we are in deep shit.

40:25.073 --> 40:26.402
Why didn't you fill up?

40:26.491 --> 40:28.199
- See what I see?
- Yes.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.790
My stars, what is that?

40:36.877 --> 40:39.166
I can run over him, get
you an alligator bag.

40:39.254 --> 40:40.452
I don't want one.

40:40.547 --> 40:41.958
- How about a belt?
- No.

40:42.049 --> 40:43.591
- Shoes?
- Nope.

40:56.605 --> 40:57.804
Howdy.

41:07.909 --> 41:09.782
You always this busy?

41:11.162 --> 41:12.573
Hell, yes.

41:12.956 --> 41:15.263
I had three cars and
a motor home, all

41:15.264 --> 41:17.333
here at the same time, last April.

41:17.418 --> 41:18.913
- You're kidding?
- Nope.

41:19.004 --> 41:21.382
Of course, that was
Easter weekend.

41:21.383 --> 41:23.298
Always picks up around then.

41:24.717 --> 41:28.466
This kind of high-pressure
business will give you ulcers.

41:29.098 --> 41:31.032
This place reminds
me of a roadhouse I

41:31.033 --> 41:32.965
knew in Texas, called
Hamburger Dan's.

41:33.059 --> 41:34.059
Ever hear of it?

41:34.060 --> 41:36.014
Let's cut the shit and
get down to business.

41:36.104 --> 41:38.726
- I ain't got all day.
- Yeah.

41:40.108 --> 41:41.519
Got any diesel fuel?

41:41.610 --> 41:45.608
If I had any more diesel fuel,
they'd make me join that OPEC.

41:46.365 --> 41:48.903
I'll let you get back to work now.

41:52.497 --> 41:55.058
I guess you want me
to pump it myself.

41:55.059 --> 41:56.245
If you want any.

42:05.594 --> 42:06.968
Snowman...

42:07.846 --> 42:09.969
you're not gonna believe this.

42:10.056 --> 42:12.262
You're gonna come up
on a sign that says:

42:12.350 --> 42:14.675
"Diesel fuel. Last
chance. Turn left."

42:14.769 --> 42:18.850
Roger. Got my 10 hung out in the
wind, looking for your sign.

42:18.941 --> 42:20.781
By the way, when we
get there, do you

42:20.782 --> 42:22.475
mind if we check on our passenger?

42:22.569 --> 42:25.606
I ain't heard anything in a while.
Could be in a lot of trouble.

42:25.697 --> 42:27.025
You grip?

42:30.035 --> 42:32.787
- Damn, she ain't right.
- How's Charlotte?

42:32.871 --> 42:35.295
I don't know anything
about elephants,

42:35.296 --> 42:37.782
but something's
bothering the old girl.

42:37.876 --> 42:40.315
I wish we could get
a hold of a vet.

42:40.316 --> 42:42.254
Fat chance of that out here.

42:51.933 --> 42:53.972
Hey, anybody in that crapper?

42:57.981 --> 42:59.921
How does he know
whether she's sick?

42:59.922 --> 43:01.314
I guess he felt her nose.

43:01.401 --> 43:04.485
I'll tell you what it is.
It's just motion sickness...

43:04.946 --> 43:06.773
What would you do without Snowman?

43:06.865 --> 43:07.944
Why? What'd you do?

43:08.033 --> 43:10.186
Remember seeing an
ambulance come by?

43:10.187 --> 43:11.532
Is that what that was?

43:12.287 --> 43:14.093
Inside that ambulance,
Miss Carrie...

43:14.094 --> 43:15.094
Was a vet.

43:15.095 --> 43:18.835
No, it was a doctor. But we might
get him to look at Charlotte.

43:18.919 --> 43:20.995
- Do you reckon?
- I reckon.

43:22.798 --> 43:24.790
- Howdy.
- Buon giorno.

43:24.883 --> 43:27.670
- You a doctor?
- Not yet, but I'm working on it.

43:27.761 --> 43:30.846
I got my green card.
My licence pending.

43:30.931 --> 43:33.173
Salute. A la beautiful Donna.

43:33.267 --> 43:35.841
- You're Italian?
- Natio.

43:35.936 --> 43:40.895
My name is Dottore Frederico
Carlucci. But you can call me Doc.

43:42.484 --> 43:43.683
Stay.

43:46.990 --> 43:48.484
Swamp fever.

43:48.783 --> 43:50.407
It's no catching.

43:50.493 --> 43:52.237
In Italy we don't have.

43:52.329 --> 43:54.238
You know what I know
about swamp fever?

43:57.042 --> 43:58.452
What's your problem?

43:58.543 --> 44:00.370
You know anything
about sick ladies?

44:00.462 --> 44:04.044
Plenty. I was the leading
gynaecologist in Pompeii.

44:04.216 --> 44:06.089
Population, 23.

44:06.176 --> 44:08.714
Well, we have a lady who
we think is very sick.

44:08.803 --> 44:11.923
She's back down here in the truck.
Would you mind looking at her?

44:12.015 --> 44:13.130
Well, I'm...

44:13.225 --> 44:15.099
Appreciate it. I
know you're eating.

44:15.185 --> 44:16.217
I was just...

44:16.312 --> 44:18.768
I know. We really
appreciate it, though.

44:18.856 --> 44:21.264
Okay. Let me take a look.

44:21.692 --> 44:22.723
Stay.

44:23.694 --> 44:25.853
- Here we go.
- Get your bag.

44:26.072 --> 44:29.357
Doctor, it's very nice of you to
take time out of your busy lunch.

44:29.450 --> 44:32.404
Listen, when somebody's sick,
you gotta stop eating.

44:32.495 --> 44:34.369
That's the Hypocritical Oath.

44:34.456 --> 44:37.029
Doc, there's something we haven't
told you about this patient.

44:37.125 --> 44:39.589
She's not the normal-size
patient. She's...

44:39.590 --> 44:40.590
Big.

44:40.591 --> 44:42.651
Big? Big don't make
no difference. I

44:42.652 --> 44:44.798
got one customer,
Anna Maria Teresa.

44:44.883 --> 44:48.086
We call her Two-Tonne Tessie.
She's built like a brick...

44:51.515 --> 44:52.973
Please.

44:55.643 --> 44:58.728
- Remember the Hypocritic Oath.
- The Hypocritic Oath.

44:58.813 --> 45:01.351
- She's a sweet elephant. Come on.
- Very sweet.

45:01.441 --> 45:02.640
No, please.

45:05.821 --> 45:09.024
Mamma Mia. When you say
big, you no fool around.

45:09.324 --> 45:12.776
She's bigger than Two-Tonne
Tessie. I tell the truth.

45:12.870 --> 45:16.998
I was gonna take her
temperature, but I need this.

45:19.501 --> 45:21.909
She's so nice. What a beauty.

45:22.004 --> 45:23.879
- Then you can help her?
- No.

45:23.965 --> 45:26.587
I told the truth. I'm
no elephant doctor.

45:26.675 --> 45:29.546
I am the leading
gynaecologist in Pompeii.

45:29.637 --> 45:31.346
She got teeth.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.514
I tell...

45:35.310 --> 45:39.770
give her 800 aspirin and
call me in the morning.

45:40.774 --> 45:43.146
Doctor, can't you do
something to help her?

45:43.234 --> 45:46.401
No, I really can't. I wish
I could, but I'm working.

45:46.488 --> 45:48.362
I'm in that ambulance.

45:48.448 --> 45:50.156
Wait. Bob.

45:51.076 --> 45:53.483
My goodness, Bob. Wait for me.

45:53.578 --> 45:56.034
You son of a... I'm in a swamp.

45:57.041 --> 45:58.203
Bob.

46:10.722 --> 46:14.049
Listen, Lone Ranger, can I
pop a ride with you guys?

46:14.050 --> 46:15.050
Sure.

46:15.051 --> 46:16.841
Thank you so much.
You going to Miami?

46:16.936 --> 46:19.557
In a roundabout way. We're
gonna take the scenic route.

46:19.647 --> 46:21.308
The scenic route. Beauty. Okay.

46:21.398 --> 46:23.308
I look on... Charlotte.

46:23.401 --> 46:24.480
Charlotte. Yes.

46:24.569 --> 46:25.898
Show him the living
accommodations.

46:25.987 --> 46:27.018
Appreciate it.

46:27.113 --> 46:28.228
I'll get your bag.

46:28.365 --> 46:31.117
If you no give me ride,
I'll be stuck here...

46:37.415 --> 46:40.666
That a girl. In the house,
Charlotte. In the house.

46:40.752 --> 46:42.875
That's it, in the house.

46:43.547 --> 46:46.002
- In the house?
- In the house.

46:47.259 --> 46:50.046
Okay. I gonna go.

46:52.223 --> 46:54.844
Okay. It dark in here.

46:55.308 --> 46:58.559
There's a light switch
over to your right, Doc.

46:58.979 --> 47:00.142
Okay.

47:01.857 --> 47:04.942
Now that we've got the medical
staff on board, let's haul ass.

47:05.028 --> 47:08.645
One of these days, I'm gonna
write a book about you.

47:08.948 --> 47:10.111
Open.

47:10.492 --> 47:12.283
Okay. Good.

47:37.686 --> 47:40.604
Hey, Daddy, look at that
big, ugly alligator.

47:40.689 --> 47:43.975
That reminds me. I gotta
call your mama tonight.

47:45.527 --> 47:47.744
You know, Daddy, I
like this place.

47:47.745 --> 47:50.023
All the gators and
snakes and stuff.

47:50.115 --> 47:52.441
Why don't we move down here?

47:52.785 --> 47:54.800
Why don't you move down here?

47:54.801 --> 47:57.531
No, Daddy. I ain't
never leaving home.

47:57.624 --> 47:59.331
That's a promise.

47:59.792 --> 48:03.790
Don't you ever threaten
your daddy like that again.

48:04.631 --> 48:05.793
What's that, Daddy?

48:05.881 --> 48:09.631
That must be one of those
new Japanese sports cars.

48:14.224 --> 48:16.549
- Howdy.
- Swamp fever.

48:18.395 --> 48:20.138
Swamp fever.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.022
Swamp Fever?

48:22.524 --> 48:26.225
Damned if I know where it is.
I'm new around here myself.

48:27.487 --> 48:28.650
Help.

48:29.322 --> 48:31.348
If I wasn't in high
pursuit, I'd have

48:31.349 --> 48:33.321
that bum and his
Sukiyaki bicycle...

48:33.410 --> 48:37.110
in the clink, for driving on
the wrong side of the road.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.553
How about you, Bandit?

49:02.691 --> 49:04.434
Got them ears on, son?

49:05.902 --> 49:07.445
Yeah, Snowman. Come on back.

49:07.529 --> 49:10.944
Look two doors behind you
and tell me what you see.

49:15.746 --> 49:17.904
Damn. That son of a
bitch never gives up.

49:17.998 --> 49:20.869
Yes, but if you'd like to see a
bit of heaven, turn around...

49:20.960 --> 49:23.049
because Big Bulldog
Joe Klecko is driving

49:23.050 --> 49:25.088
that Pete parked right
on your backdoor.

49:25.172 --> 49:26.714
Right, Joe?

49:26.798 --> 49:28.127
Hi, Joe.

49:28.426 --> 49:29.967
Howdy, Bandit.

49:30.886 --> 49:33.923
I'll leave this in your hands,
Snowman. We're coming around.

49:34.015 --> 49:37.181
Roger. We'll break for that,
Big Bulldog Joe Klecko.

49:37.267 --> 49:39.343
You got the Bulldog. Kick it back.

49:39.436 --> 49:42.556
See if you can delay that County
Mountie at your backdoor.

49:42.648 --> 49:43.728
10-4.

49:43.816 --> 49:45.524
It's the Bandit.

49:49.447 --> 49:52.199
Hey, you big piece of turkey dump.

49:52.408 --> 49:54.845
Get that mess the
hell out of there.

49:54.846 --> 49:56.157
You talking to me?

49:56.246 --> 49:58.322
Yes, I'm talking to you.

49:58.414 --> 50:00.822
I'll see if I can get it in gear.

50:05.089 --> 50:07.461
Wait a minute. Hold it.

50:08.299 --> 50:10.293
Wait a minute.

50:10.927 --> 50:14.926
You do that once again, and
I'm gonna take you apart...

50:15.015 --> 50:16.675
piece by piece.

50:30.740 --> 50:32.364
Badge is crooked, sir.

50:42.376 --> 50:44.204
Much obliged.

50:47.298 --> 50:49.090
Who was that, Daddy?

50:49.176 --> 50:52.295
I don't know, but the
circus must be in town.

50:53.513 --> 50:55.137
Hang on, Junior.

50:56.433 --> 50:59.304
- Daddy, the bridge.
- I can make that easy.

51:11.740 --> 51:14.362
- I tried to tell you, Daddy.
- Shut your ass.

51:14.451 --> 51:16.740
- Now, get out and push.
- Daddy, I...

51:16.829 --> 51:18.821
Get out and push.

51:20.792 --> 51:22.369
Okay, but...

51:26.589 --> 51:29.127
It looks like we've got
a decision to make.

51:29.216 --> 51:30.628
Yeah, it does.

51:30.719 --> 51:33.007
- Heads up, tails down.
- You got it.

51:34.639 --> 51:36.631
This one's for you.

51:51.740 --> 51:55.073
Would you look at that? They
love me in Ole Miss, too.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.405
Hi.

52:11.677 --> 52:13.800
Snowman, you got your ears on?

52:13.888 --> 52:15.690
Anything happening with Charlotte?

52:15.691 --> 52:16.691
Negatory.

52:16.692 --> 52:18.747
Ain't much with
Charlotte. You don't

52:18.748 --> 52:20.852
reckon the doc got
squashed, do you?

52:21.604 --> 52:24.309
- Come on, ring my phone.
- We'll stop here.

52:25.525 --> 52:27.714
Giving Doc a mercy
stop every 1,000

52:27.715 --> 52:29.902
miles ain't asking
too much, is it?

52:29.988 --> 52:32.693
But we're not gonna
make this a habit.

52:39.372 --> 52:42.872
- You drive crazy.
- Is Charlotte all right?

52:42.959 --> 52:45.961
She's okay, but I need air.

52:46.838 --> 52:48.463
Give me a break.

52:48.549 --> 52:50.707
- Where are we?
- On our way to Texas.

52:50.801 --> 52:53.173
Texas? Is that near Miami?

52:54.013 --> 52:56.634
- Her nose cold.
- It's very close to Miami.

52:56.724 --> 52:59.096
Yes, that's good because
I gotta go to Miami.

52:59.185 --> 53:00.968
You understand? I've got a lot of

53:00.969 --> 53:02.968
patients there. I'm
no real doctor.

53:03.063 --> 53:05.519
But I do operations on the side.

53:06.025 --> 53:07.650
A lot of sick people need me.

53:07.735 --> 53:11.863
It would be no good if I leave,
because I got the swamp fever...

53:11.948 --> 53:14.783
a lot of them got a rash,
different things like that.

53:14.868 --> 53:17.149
I tell you the
truth, they need me.

53:17.150 --> 53:19.494
They gonna be fine.
Don't you worry.

53:20.582 --> 53:22.456
Pardon me. All
right, take it easy.

53:22.542 --> 53:24.744
I'll give her a nice
examination soon

53:24.745 --> 53:27.003
as she gets her nose
out of my crotch.

53:27.088 --> 53:29.021
We'll leave the
elephant on the truck.

53:29.022 --> 53:31.003
Give her an examination
while we drive.

53:31.093 --> 53:34.093
No, it's no good. No
room for the stirrup.

53:34.179 --> 53:36.750
You don't understand.
We're in a big hurry.

53:36.751 --> 53:38.426
Bo, it's a living creature.

53:38.517 --> 53:41.066
That's right. She'll
mean very little to

53:41.067 --> 53:43.428
us if we get to Texas
and she's dead.

53:43.522 --> 53:45.847
All right, I'll bring her off.

53:46.526 --> 53:48.067
Excuse me.

53:48.819 --> 53:50.966
Snowman's always
had a heart. Cares

53:50.967 --> 53:53.113
about something
other than himself.

53:54.200 --> 53:58.743
Well, at least you aren't mad
at me. Come on, sweetheart.

54:00.623 --> 54:02.662
Daddy, I got to pee-pee.

54:02.792 --> 54:06.125
- Swallow it. I'm busy.
- But, Daddy, I got to go.

54:06.838 --> 54:08.996
You're just like your mama.

54:09.424 --> 54:11.672
Your mama can't
drive more than two

54:11.673 --> 54:14.169
miles before she's
gotta take a squirt.

54:20.227 --> 54:22.136
Hurry up. Give it a fast shake.

54:22.813 --> 54:24.805
Well, what do you think?

54:28.027 --> 54:30.019
She's something else, I tell you.

54:30.112 --> 54:33.646
Okay, I gotta look down your
throat. Open. Say "Ahh."

54:35.659 --> 54:36.904
For goodness' sake.

54:36.994 --> 54:40.445
- What happened?
- My ring. Oh, geez.

54:41.249 --> 54:44.165
I need a tongue depressor
about this big.

54:48.297 --> 54:49.957
Daddy?

54:51.509 --> 54:53.252
My zipper's stuck.

55:12.614 --> 55:14.239
Get in the car, Junior.

55:14.324 --> 55:18.487
- But, Daddy, my zipper's stuck.
- Get in the car, Junior.

55:20.164 --> 55:21.951
Daddy, my fly's still open.

55:21.952 --> 55:24.292
Let me tell you something, Junior.

55:24.626 --> 55:27.462
If you ever embarrass
me like that again...

55:27.546 --> 55:29.420
I'm gonna get an axe...

55:29.506 --> 55:32.710
and you're never gonna have
to open your fly again.

55:33.386 --> 55:36.588
He loves me. He loves himself.

55:37.097 --> 55:40.383
He loves me. He loves himself.

55:40.977 --> 55:43.302
- He loves me.
- Hi.

55:47.775 --> 55:49.483
I brought you a present.

55:49.568 --> 55:51.396
- You're kidding?
- No.

55:54.032 --> 55:57.317
- Is it gonna blow up in my face?
- It's my record.

55:59.912 --> 56:02.486
We only pressed 75 of them, but...

56:02.916 --> 56:05.288
Well, I wanted you to have one.

56:05.669 --> 56:08.124
You probably saw them
at the KMart, you know.

56:08.213 --> 56:10.243
They gave them away to everybody

56:10.244 --> 56:12.591
that bought anything
over 25 cents.

56:13.301 --> 56:17.050
- I've still got 74 of them.
- I think it represents you well.

56:17.847 --> 56:19.971
I mean, Frank Sinatra
sang My Way...

56:20.059 --> 56:23.677
and you sing Let's Do Something
Cheap and Superficial.

56:24.981 --> 56:26.178
Cruel.

56:28.358 --> 56:29.770
Yeah, I know it.

56:29.860 --> 56:33.312
When I'm around you, I don't
like the way I sound.

56:36.034 --> 56:39.117
Probably the way I used to
act makes you act that way.

56:39.203 --> 56:40.449
That's right.

56:41.039 --> 56:44.324
Oh, God. Sometimes I hate
the way I sound around you.

56:45.376 --> 56:48.876
Maybe it's because of the
way you used to treat me.

56:53.552 --> 56:56.043
Hey, Frog, Bandit.
Charlotte's sick.

56:56.138 --> 56:58.344
- Charlotte's sick. Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

56:58.432 --> 57:02.215
Sometimes I think you like that
elephant more than you do me.

57:03.145 --> 57:05.184
Hang on to that thought.

57:06.231 --> 57:09.019
Doctor, what's the matter with
Charlotte? She all right?

57:09.109 --> 57:13.023
I think you're gonna be very
happy. Charlotte's fine...

57:13.655 --> 57:16.407
and I hope the bambino fine, too.

57:16.492 --> 57:19.197
- The what?
- The bambino. Baby.

57:19.871 --> 57:21.993
- Did he say "baby"?
- He just said "baby."

57:22.081 --> 57:23.615
Why did you say "baby"?

57:23.616 --> 57:26.375
Because la signora
Charlotte is pregnant.

57:27.170 --> 57:29.042
Gonna have a little baby elephant.

57:29.043 --> 57:31.167
No, you gonna have a
big baby elephant.

57:31.257 --> 57:34.092
- Who did it?
- Don't look at me.

57:34.177 --> 57:35.588
Probably another elephant.

57:35.679 --> 57:38.595
- I know that, but when?
- Long time ago.

57:38.889 --> 57:42.639
- When is she gonna have the baby?
- Any days, any minutes.

57:43.562 --> 57:45.435
Shit. What are we gonna do?

57:45.522 --> 57:48.856
- We better keep our eyes peeled.
- For what?

57:48.942 --> 57:51.350
For the biggest goddamn
stork you ever seen.

57:51.445 --> 57:53.437
Big stork. With the...

57:54.073 --> 57:57.607
- American joke, right?
- That's not funny.

57:58.285 --> 58:00.320
We'll take this
elephant in the truck,

58:00.321 --> 58:02.199
and we'll drive to
Dallas with her.

58:02.289 --> 58:03.914
- Bo, pooh.
- What?

58:04.250 --> 58:06.622
We're not gonna move
Charlotte anywhere.

58:06.711 --> 58:08.869
Honey, you probably
don't realise this.

58:08.963 --> 58:11.670
In Dallas, they have
the greatest elephant

58:11.671 --> 58:13.874
doctors. Ain't that right, Cledus?

58:13.968 --> 58:16.375
Why don't we ask this
doctor? What do you think?

58:16.470 --> 58:20.006
You think we should we move
Charlotte or let her rest or what?

58:21.225 --> 58:24.642
The lady gonna have a baby. She
no can be move for 24 hours.

58:24.729 --> 58:26.472
- What?
- Make it 12.

58:26.940 --> 58:30.143
I'll load her up right now. Come
on. We're running out of time.

58:30.235 --> 58:31.729
- Bo.
- What?

58:33.654 --> 58:34.818
What?

58:35.616 --> 58:39.743
God, I've missed you.
I've missed you so.

58:41.162 --> 58:43.081
It's a little hard to get

58:43.082 --> 58:46.074
reacquainted going
110 miles an hour.

58:46.417 --> 58:49.703
So what could be wrong
spending the night...

58:49.921 --> 58:52.543
- under the stars together?
- Nothing.

58:53.759 --> 58:56.547
- You mean, just you and I, alone?
- Together.

58:56.845 --> 58:58.838
What's going on?

58:58.931 --> 58:59.998
What's going on?

58:59.999 --> 59:02.430
Well, I would say
that she's in love.

59:02.518 --> 59:05.435
Of course, the fat ones
always did go for Bo.

59:06.522 --> 59:09.607
She's jealous. Pregnant
ladies always act funny.

59:09.692 --> 59:10.972
What am I gonna do?

59:11.068 --> 59:14.272
It's important not to upset
her. She's got to be very calm.

59:14.364 --> 59:15.442
Keep her calm.

59:15.531 --> 59:18.616
Get her nice and calm. Then
later tonight, you and I...

59:18.701 --> 59:20.741
- Later on, I'll...
- Yeah.

59:21.663 --> 59:24.783
Later on, I'll meet
you. Okay? Later on.

59:24.875 --> 59:28.243
Yeah. I'll keep the blankets
warm. Just keep her calm.

59:28.837 --> 59:32.288
Charlotte, look. This isn't
gonna work out because...

59:32.382 --> 59:35.716
physically we're not the
right size for each other.

59:35.802 --> 59:37.712

looks like somebody up
there must like us, boy.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:25.029
Hey, Bandit, I ain't seen
a smokey now for hours.

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:27.099
Looks like we got
it clean and green

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.700
all the way to Louisiana patch.

01:01:28.794 --> 01:01:31.914
- What do you think? Come on.
- Knock on wood, son.

01:01:32.965 --> 01:01:35.254
You know what I'll do with
my share of the money?

01:01:35.343 --> 01:01:36.457
Cute.

01:01:36.552 --> 01:01:39.588
I'm gonna get my wife and kids
something they always wanted.

01:01:39.722 --> 01:01:42.213
I'm gonna send them
on a trip to Hawaii.

01:01:42.976 --> 01:01:45.930
Snowman, you're so crazy
about your family?

01:01:46.019 --> 01:01:49.471
Are you crazy or something?
I ain't going with them.

01:02:00.285 --> 01:02:01.909
Break for the Bandit.

01:02:01.994 --> 01:02:06.159
Guess who just snuck around my
backdoor and is knocking on yours?

01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:08.626
Hello, Buford.

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:10.750
Hello, you big lollipop.

01:02:11.129 --> 01:02:15.079
Guess who's driving right
up your alimentary canal?

01:02:16.301 --> 01:02:20.001
Elementary is about as far as you
got in school, isn't it, son?

01:02:20.096 --> 01:02:23.347
Tell you what. As long as we're
talking about elementary school...

01:02:23.433 --> 01:02:26.185
why don't we play Follow
the Leader, bumble-butt?

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:29.141
Well, I'll follow, but you
certainly ain't my leader.

01:02:29.231 --> 01:02:30.974
Come on, fat boy.

01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:33.737
Daddy, I like to play
Follow the Leader.

01:02:33.738 --> 01:02:34.776
Shut up, you shit.

01:02:37.031 --> 01:02:39.645
I hate to tell you
this, but you're going

01:02:39.646 --> 01:02:41.823
the wrong way on a one-way street.

01:02:43.913 --> 01:02:45.158
Turn left here, Daddy.

01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:49.874
Hold it. Wait.

01:02:50.503 --> 01:02:52.460
That's easy for you to say.

01:02:52.797 --> 01:02:54.706
Straight ahead, Daddy.

01:02:57.469 --> 01:02:58.962
We're closed.

01:03:02.849 --> 01:03:04.972
Make another right, Daddy.

01:03:05.268 --> 01:03:07.724
Oh, boy. A roller coaster.

01:03:14.903 --> 01:03:17.311
Turn left right here, Daddy.

01:03:22.536 --> 01:03:26.285
- Damn, I love amusement parks.
- You are an amusement park.

01:03:31.379 --> 01:03:33.667
Now turn right and
we'll be in the clear.

01:03:33.756 --> 01:03:36.378
- A thrill a minute.
- That's about how long it lasts.

01:03:36.467 --> 01:03:38.543
That was below the belt.

01:04:16.592 --> 01:04:18.501
"Make a left turn, Daddy.

01:04:19.053 --> 01:04:22.220
"Make a right turn, Daddy.
We'll be in the clear."

01:04:23.224 --> 01:04:24.802
You moose twit.

01:04:27.312 --> 01:04:29.185
Bye-bye, baby

01:04:30.356 --> 01:04:32.894
Sir, I am the owner of this...

01:04:34.277 --> 01:04:36.815
Of this mess, and...

01:04:36.905 --> 01:04:39.692
What are you trying to tell
me? I'm in hot pursuit.

01:04:39.783 --> 01:04:42.356
I would like to say
just one thing.

01:04:44.997 --> 01:04:46.490
We're closed.

01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:51.415
Get in the car, Junior. We're
surrounded by a mental case.

01:04:51.837 --> 01:04:54.078
That's correct, Sheriff Justice.

01:04:54.172 --> 01:04:56.960
The Bandit just entered Louisiana.

01:04:57.134 --> 01:05:00.005
You're here at a
monumental moment.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:03.885
I'm gonna call my kin for help.

01:05:04.683 --> 01:05:07.055
I'm calling my brother Reggie...

01:05:07.144 --> 01:05:10.264
and I'm calling my
brother Gaylord.

01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:14.521
They've been in law enforcement
for over 20 years.

01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:18.650
Get me Quebec, Canada,
on the phone.

01:05:19.199 --> 01:05:22.567
- Canada?
- Yes, up north.

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:29.495
- How much I owe you, my man?
- $24.

01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:32.868
You take a personal check?

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.584
Just making a joke. $24, huh?

01:05:36.842 --> 01:05:39.000
Here you go. $25, keep the change.

01:05:39.094 --> 01:05:41.170
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

01:05:41.263 --> 01:05:44.964
You wouldn't be the guy they
call the Bandit, would you?

01:05:45.226 --> 01:05:47.301
- The one and only.
- Bandit.

01:05:47.394 --> 01:05:48.966
Now that you've graced my humble

01:05:48.967 --> 01:05:51.226
establishment, I'll take
this opportunity...

01:05:51.315 --> 01:05:53.521
- to tell you something.
- Go right ahead.

01:05:53.608 --> 01:05:55.392
If I was making a
list of the great

01:05:55.393 --> 01:05:56.978
assholes of the 20th century...

01:05:57.071 --> 01:05:59.147
you'd be in the top five.

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:01.981
Hey, wait a minute.

01:06:01.982 --> 01:06:04.483
Bo, even Bambi has
enemies. Let's go.

01:06:04.578 --> 01:06:07.122
Listen. Let me tell
you something. I'm

01:06:07.123 --> 01:06:09.406
practically an American folk hero.

01:06:09.792 --> 01:06:12.663
Ask some of my fans. To
know me is to love me.

01:06:12.754 --> 01:06:14.995
You know, I just made a
correction on my list.

01:06:15.089 --> 01:06:17.759
- Yeah?
- You're in the top two assholes.

01:06:19.052 --> 01:06:20.712
How about I give you my poster?

01:06:20.804 --> 01:06:23.425
Me in the Trans-Am going
up the World Trade Centre.

01:06:23.515 --> 01:06:25.341
Buzz off. I'm busy.

01:06:26.268 --> 01:06:28.589
God damn it. I'm one
of the most beloved

01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:30.514
grassroot folk heroes of America.

01:06:30.605 --> 01:06:33.096
Hey. Get out of here, you weirdo.

01:06:33.191 --> 01:06:35.275
Listen to me. Little kids love me.

01:06:35.276 --> 01:06:37.605
Parents love me.
Everybody loves me.

01:06:37.697 --> 01:06:41.065
Come on out here and love me, or
I'll kick your little skinny ass.

01:06:41.158 --> 01:06:43.945
Excuse me. Hi. How are
you? Good to see you.

01:06:44.036 --> 01:06:45.705
Get a hold of yourself. You're not

01:06:45.706 --> 01:06:47.619
exactly baseball and
mum's apple pie.

01:06:47.707 --> 01:06:49.558
The man has a right
to his opinion.

01:06:49.559 --> 01:06:50.873
Who does he think he is?

01:06:50.959 --> 01:06:54.578
You ought to ask yourself that
question. Have a nice day.

01:06:55.799 --> 01:06:58.171
I'm telling you, people love me.

01:07:06.559 --> 01:07:07.630
What's wrong?

01:07:07.631 --> 01:07:10.343
We got a problem. Talk to the doc.

01:07:13.734 --> 01:07:15.192
What's the matter, Doc?

01:07:16.653 --> 01:07:19.819
She no can go. She gonna
start the labour.

01:07:20.407 --> 01:07:22.494
Maybe we need to get
her off her feet.

01:07:22.495 --> 01:07:24.072
Exactly. That's the problem.

01:07:24.161 --> 01:07:26.450
In there she bounce
around. Too much danger.

01:07:26.538 --> 01:07:28.911
She just wants a little
attention, that's all.

01:07:28.999 --> 01:07:31.953
We'll load her on the truck and
get going. Come on, let's go.

01:07:32.044 --> 01:07:34.879
Of course, we load her up
on the truck and let's go.

01:07:34.964 --> 01:07:37.170
La signora Charlotte can
do anything she wants.

01:07:37.258 --> 01:07:39.341
Put her on the truck.
Sure, take the

01:07:39.342 --> 01:07:41.255
baby and go bada bing, bada bong.

01:07:41.345 --> 01:07:44.014
It don't make no
difference to you...

01:07:44.098 --> 01:07:47.099
Lone Ranger of the United
States of America.

01:07:49.186 --> 01:07:52.852
I tell one thing, I no
gonna be responsible.

01:07:59.197 --> 01:08:01.522
What's the matter? Don't
you understand English?

01:08:01.616 --> 01:08:05.863
He said you can't be bouncing her
around. She's gonna have a baby.

01:08:06.205 --> 01:08:08.743
Don't you understand $400,000?

01:08:08.956 --> 01:08:12.540
This is the last chance we're
ever gonna have. $400,000.

01:08:12.627 --> 01:08:16.376
I understand, and I'd like to
have my share of the $400,000.

01:08:16.465 --> 01:08:19.170
But I ain't gonna kill
an elephant to get it.

01:08:38.404 --> 01:08:40.810
Bo, it isn't the money, is it?

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:45.691
You want to make this last run
so you can be famous again.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:50.033
Be the old Bandit, come driving
in there and be everybody's hero?

01:08:51.751 --> 01:08:55.749
I know you. You don't want to
hurt this elephant. I know you.

01:09:01.344 --> 01:09:04.678
I don't want to hurt the
elephant. I really don't.

01:09:07.017 --> 01:09:10.184
It's just maybe my last
chance to be somebody.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:16.265
Bo, everybody is somebody.

01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:20.102
Yeah.

01:09:20.197 --> 01:09:22.604
Hey, we were just thinking.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.903
Maybe we have been working
too hard, you reckon?

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:29.115
We'll go into town, have
some wine, women, and song.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.913
A little pasta fagioli.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.246
- This your elephant?
- Yeah. Who's that?

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:38.127
You live around here, kid?

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:41.206
Across the track,
on the good side.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:44.220
- What's your name?
- My name is Anthony T. Townes.

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:46.464
My name is Bandit Darville.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:50.221
- I guess you've heard of me, huh?
- Nope.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.689
Well, I'm kind of famous.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:56.105
- Rich?
- I'm working on it.

01:09:56.568 --> 01:09:59.189
How would you like to
watch him for a while?

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:01.770
You won't believe this,
but I'm very busy.

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:05.069
- Oh, yeah?
- But I could be persuaded.

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:09.032
Tell me, how much does
the elephant weigh?

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.447
The elephant weighs about
four and a half tons.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.913
Could you pay me by the pound?

01:10:14.837 --> 01:10:16.710
Cute, isn't he? Cute.

01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:20.922
What kind of music you
got here in town?

01:10:20.923 --> 01:10:22.006
Rhythm and blues.

01:10:22.094 --> 01:10:24.466
Rhythm and blues? Wow.

01:10:24.555 --> 01:10:27.046
- How do you like Country?
- Country sucks.

01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:31.009
He hates Country. Isn't there
anybody in town sings Country?

01:10:31.104 --> 01:10:33.392
There's this cat,
name of Don Williams.

01:10:33.481 --> 01:10:37.810
My second favourite singer in the
whole world is Don Williams.

01:10:39.154 --> 01:10:41.660
We'll go to town,
listen to Don Williams

01:10:41.661 --> 01:10:43.982
and be back. You
watch this elephant.

01:10:44.075 --> 01:10:46.068
If anything happens
to the elephant...

01:10:46.161 --> 01:10:48.866
I know. You're gonna
feed me to him.

01:10:56.213 --> 01:10:59.962
You know, Daddy, I don't think
the Bandit's really bad.

01:11:00.468 --> 01:11:04.382
I think the trouble is he just
got in with real bad company.

01:11:05.139 --> 01:11:06.597
Bad company?

01:11:07.892 --> 01:11:10.430
Let me tell you something, Junior.

01:11:10.645 --> 01:11:14.476
When you raid a cathouse, you
take the piano player, too.

01:11:36.296 --> 01:11:40.044
Thank you. Folks, I'd like
for you all to know...

01:11:40.467 --> 01:11:43.801
that we have an honest-to-goodness
celebrity with us here tonight.

01:11:43.887 --> 01:11:45.511
Some folks might hate him...

01:11:45.597 --> 01:11:48.515
but I know there's a bunch
of us that really love him.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.179
You all welcome the world's
biggest show-off, the Bandit.

01:11:59.695 --> 01:12:02.981
I think I know how you
feel about things, Bandit.

01:12:03.157 --> 01:12:06.608
I'd like to dedicate my new
song to both of you all.

01:12:15.336 --> 01:12:19.203

What are you doing?

01:12:40.276 --> 01:12:42.853
I was writing a little
poem about you.

01:12:43.949 --> 01:12:46.238
- Can I see?
- I'll show it to you.

01:12:46.952 --> 01:12:48.327

The doc said we gotta take the
weight off Charlotte's legs.

01:13:12.145 --> 01:13:14.539
So, I figured out
if I built this net

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:16.807
and took the weight
off her legs...

01:13:16.899 --> 01:13:20.316
that we could just tool on
down the road to Dallas.

01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:22.734
Fine.

01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:29.448

Hey.

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.879
- Where you going?
- New York.

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:45.547
- Why?
- Because you're not there.

01:13:45.638 --> 01:13:47.465
What's the matter with you?

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.706
You punch your friend,
yell at the doctor

01:13:49.707 --> 01:13:51.804
who looks like the
Pillsbury Doughboy...

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:54.131
play hootchy-koo
with me, and all the

01:13:54.132 --> 01:13:56.603
time you're trying to
make this run work.

01:13:56.691 --> 01:14:00.274
I'm not trying to figure it out. I
figured out how to make it work.

01:14:00.362 --> 01:14:02.195
And I'm gonna make this run work.

01:14:02.196 --> 01:14:03.315
That is it for you.

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:06.027
You have had it. You're
hooked. You're a fame junkie.

01:14:06.117 --> 01:14:08.323
They should give you
intravenous feedings...

01:14:08.411 --> 01:14:10.949
of People magazine and
National Enquirer headlines.

01:14:11.038 --> 01:14:13.054
And if you're a real
good boy, they'll

01:14:13.055 --> 01:14:14.657
give you a Tonight Show enema.

01:14:14.751 --> 01:14:15.914
What is the matter?

01:14:16.003 --> 01:14:18.541
If you weren't so dumb,
they'd put you on Cross-Wits.

01:14:18.631 --> 01:14:20.872
What is the matter with you?

01:14:23.844 --> 01:14:25.386
You know what?

01:14:26.055 --> 01:14:29.719
When I first met you, I think
you really liked yourself.

01:14:30.392 --> 01:14:31.886
I liked you.

01:14:33.145 --> 01:14:35.470
And you did what you did best.

01:14:37.024 --> 01:14:38.133
What, show off?

01:14:38.134 --> 01:14:41.069
Yeah. You did it so
good, you got famous.

01:14:41.154 --> 01:14:43.233
Then you had to do
more and more until

01:14:43.234 --> 01:14:45.365
you were doing what
you didn't do best.

01:14:45.449 --> 01:14:48.534
And now I don't think
you even have any fun.

01:14:48.786 --> 01:14:51.242
I'm not having any fun right now.

01:14:51.331 --> 01:14:52.824
Neither am I.

01:14:54.835 --> 01:14:57.326
I hope you like yourself someday.

01:15:02.593 --> 01:15:03.920
Goodbye.

01:15:28.703 --> 01:15:30.612
You know, Charlotte...

01:15:31.663 --> 01:15:34.037
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

01:15:35.459 --> 01:15:37.749
I don't wanna see
you start drinking

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:40.038
either. It's not a
good thing to do.

01:15:40.131 --> 01:15:41.958
I'm weak. I admit it.

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:44.967
I'm a weak person. I
need other people.

01:15:46.388 --> 01:15:48.546
Don't turn your back on me.

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:50.300
I need you.

01:15:50.975 --> 01:15:53.466
I need somebody to care about me.

01:15:53.979 --> 01:15:55.556
Not that much.

01:15:56.815 --> 01:16:00.943
Look, I came up with this thing.
You think this was a good idea?

01:16:01.027 --> 01:16:04.611
Look. I got your legs up off
the floor and everything.

01:16:05.074 --> 01:16:08.407
- What do you say, guys?
- Bo, you're drunk.

01:16:09.995 --> 01:16:14.075
- Is it gonna work, Doc?
- Yes, Lone Ranger, it'll work.

01:16:14.166 --> 01:16:16.455
- Good thinking.
- Thanks, Kemo Sabe.

01:16:16.543 --> 01:16:20.078
- Okay, let's get rolling.
- Come on. I help you down.

01:16:20.214 --> 01:16:21.376
Okay.

01:16:23.217 --> 01:16:26.172
- What about the bottle, Bo?
- What about it?

01:16:27.972 --> 01:16:31.756
Daddy, I can't wait to meet
Uncle Gaylord and Uncle Reggie.

01:16:32.894 --> 01:16:36.477
Bandit, I hate to upset your
stomach by mentioning this name...

01:16:36.565 --> 01:16:40.858
but do you realise it's been a few
miles since we've seen Buford T.?

01:16:40.944 --> 01:16:42.651
I don't miss him.

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:48.492
That's nice.

01:16:52.664 --> 01:16:55.867
Where the hell are they?
They should be here by now.

01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:58.533
Hello, Buford, you old sugar.

01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:05.128
Is that you, Gaylord?

01:17:05.219 --> 01:17:08.007
You bet your little
bellybutton it is.

01:17:14.144 --> 01:17:16.623
Did you bring the troops with you?

01:17:16.624 --> 01:17:17.624
I sure did.

01:17:17.648 --> 01:17:20.222
Well, that's fine. Now,
where the hell is Reggie?

01:17:20.318 --> 01:17:22.809
I think I hear him coming now.

01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:20.873
Sergeant Reginald Van
Justice reporting for duty.

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:24.546
Well, ain't that nice? But
have you got the men with you?

01:18:24.634 --> 01:18:27.968
They're in position and
stand at the ready.

01:18:31.933 --> 01:18:33.392
Say, you know something?

01:18:33.477 --> 01:18:37.308
This is the first time in 20
years we've all been together.

01:18:37.397 --> 01:18:40.980
- Why don't we all take a picture?
- That's a good idea.

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:43.398
Junior, get the camera
out of the car.

01:18:43.487 --> 01:18:44.981
Come on, P.T.

01:18:49.743 --> 01:18:51.024
Everybody ready?

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.323
- Say cheese, Ramona.
- Let's go.

01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:56.666
That's it.

01:18:56.793 --> 01:19:00.837
All right, men. Let's
mount up and cut out.

01:19:01.506 --> 01:19:06.132
Son, if we keep humping all night,
we'll be in Dallas by morning.

01:19:06.886 --> 01:19:08.510
We're finally in Texas.

01:19:18.773 --> 01:19:22.937
Hey, Bandit, we got you-know-who
on my backdoor one more time.

01:19:25.864 --> 01:19:30.906
Say, Bandit, if you make a left
turn on this next dirt road...

01:19:31.828 --> 01:19:36.242
then your ass is gonna be
grass, and I'm gonna mow it.

01:19:36.334 --> 01:19:39.334
You ought to put some Preparation
H on your lips, Buford...

01:19:39.419 --> 01:19:41.910
cause you're talking out
of your you-know-what.

01:19:42.005 --> 01:19:44.389
This is the left,
Bandit. Now, are you

01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:46.467
gonna take that challenge or not?

01:19:46.552 --> 01:19:48.426
Come on, fat boy.

01:19:52.808 --> 01:19:55.809
Snowman, keep on hoofing
it down the road.

01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:58.078
Buford thinks he's
suckering me into

01:19:58.079 --> 01:19:59.977
something, but it
ain't gonna happen.

01:20:00.065 --> 01:20:02.128
We're both going out
into this desert,

01:20:02.129 --> 01:20:03.980
but only one of us is coming back.

01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:05.730
You hear that, Buford?

01:20:05.822 --> 01:20:07.897
Are you ready, Gaylord?

01:20:08.241 --> 01:20:11.859
We are ready with charge akimbo.

01:20:12.245 --> 01:20:14.154
Are you ready, Reggie?

01:20:14.247 --> 01:20:17.332
We are prepared for combat.

01:20:17.584 --> 01:20:19.873
And are you ready, Bandit?

01:20:20.504 --> 01:20:22.793
I was born ready, lard ass.

01:20:27.302 --> 01:20:30.220
Just take a little
look up to your right.

01:20:32.474 --> 01:20:35.345
Now, take a little
look up to your left.

01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:39.596
Now, take a look behind you.

01:20:40.191 --> 01:20:43.441
I'm about to crush your walnuts.

01:20:44.904 --> 01:20:47.691
I'm about to get my
walnuts outta here.

01:20:50.409 --> 01:20:52.069
Let's roll them.

01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:23.438
Snowman, I got me some
serious trouble here, son.

01:21:23.777 --> 01:21:25.983
And I ain't kidding this time.

01:21:26.071 --> 01:21:28.906
I got wall-to-wall County
Mounties and Mountie Mounties.

01:21:28.991 --> 01:21:32.027
Maybe a hundred of them. This
may be more than I can handle.

01:21:32.119 --> 01:21:35.952
Listen to me, and you listen
good. Make the delivery.

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.448
You just hang on. We'll
be there in a minute.

01:21:38.543 --> 01:21:40.785
Do as I say. Deliver
them goddamn goods.

01:21:40.879 --> 01:21:42.503
I'll catch up with you later.

01:21:42.588 --> 01:21:44.379
You know what you're
talking about.

01:21:44.465 --> 01:21:47.183
But just in case you
don't, Snowman's

01:21:47.184 --> 01:21:49.258
gonna be standing by. Roger.

01:22:05.904 --> 01:22:08.905
Come on, Trigger. Don't
let me down now.

01:22:15.747 --> 01:22:18.119
Buford, I hope you got
group insurance...

01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:21.660
because I'm about to spread some
iron all over this goddamn desert.

01:22:21.754 --> 01:22:26.416
Don't worry about that. I got
my whole ass in good hands.

01:22:27.677 --> 01:22:29.716
King Kong ain't got
hands that big.

01:22:39.689 --> 01:22:43.984
Snowman, you damn fool. I told you
to haul ass and get outta here.

01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:47.481
And I told you that when we set
out to do a job together...

01:22:47.572 --> 01:22:49.031
we do it together. Roger.

01:22:49.116 --> 01:22:51.317
I don't care about
your skinny little

01:22:51.318 --> 01:22:53.113
ass, but what about Charlotte?

01:22:53.203 --> 01:22:55.694
Don't worry about her.
They got a ringside seat.

01:22:55.789 --> 01:22:58.410
Tell me, how many
trucks do you see?

01:22:58.876 --> 01:23:01.545
I see one, unless
I've been drinking.

01:23:02.046 --> 01:23:04.715
Hey, boys. Do it to it.

01:23:16.727 --> 01:23:19.432
Then I must be
commode-hanging drunk...

01:23:19.522 --> 01:23:22.227
because I swear I see
a ton of trucks.

01:23:29.407 --> 01:23:33.026
- Hey, Daddy, what's that?
- Holy shit.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:43.084
Welcome to the world's biggest
game of chicken, boys.

01:23:43.171 --> 01:23:44.451
Shit.

01:23:50.721 --> 01:23:53.508
Hang on, boys. The army's coming.

01:24:07.905 --> 01:24:11.357
This is the Plowboy. I
got me one lined up.

01:24:22.754 --> 01:24:25.292
Excuse me, sir. Your
ass is on fire.

01:24:25.382 --> 01:24:29.794
Bet you'll be glad to get back to
Canada and stick it in the snow.

01:24:35.475 --> 01:24:37.883
Not bad driving for a
couple of Mounties.

01:24:37.978 --> 01:24:39.805
Yeah, but look up ahead.

01:24:45.527 --> 01:24:48.564
- Seminole, you got your ears on?
- I copy.

01:24:48.656 --> 01:24:51.229
I want you to dump that
boy in the garbage.

01:24:51.325 --> 01:24:54.325
That's exactly what I
had in mind, Bandit.

01:25:10.511 --> 01:25:13.465
- Hey, Roadrunner, you hungry?
- Why do you ask?

01:25:13.556 --> 01:25:17.175
Just move towards me. We'll
have us a Mountie sandwich.

01:25:49.843 --> 01:25:52.002
Brake for that, short boy.

01:25:52.096 --> 01:25:54.847
You're too old to play in the hay.

01:26:00.313 --> 01:26:02.886
Now that we've got them,
what will we do with them?

01:26:02.982 --> 01:26:05.817
Hell, there's a parking
lot right here.

01:26:11.992 --> 01:26:14.399
Three out of four ain't
bad. Where you taking them?

01:26:14.494 --> 01:26:17.068
- How about the dump?
- Good thinking.

01:26:18.581 --> 01:26:20.574
Junior, the way things look...

01:26:20.667 --> 01:26:23.703
I'm beginning to be
deeply concerned.

01:26:25.463 --> 01:26:27.671
Fred, this one's for you, my boy.

01:26:27.758 --> 01:26:29.501
Look out, Junior.

01:26:34.515 --> 01:26:36.922
- Are you all right, Junior?
- Yeah.

01:26:37.017 --> 01:26:39.010
You would be, you shit.

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.853
Way to go. Take it to him, son.

01:26:52.867 --> 01:26:54.361
Whoa.

01:27:04.004 --> 01:27:06.542
How do you like that, turkey shit?

01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:11.875
Snowman, I've had about as much
fun as I can handle for one day.

01:27:11.970 --> 01:27:13.963
How about showing me
the way outta here?

01:27:14.056 --> 01:27:16.808
All right. Roger. Jump
on my tailgate, Bandit.

01:27:16.892 --> 01:27:19.300
I know where the front
door's located.

01:27:29.029 --> 01:27:31.318
Look at that pile of cars, Daddy.

01:27:31.407 --> 01:27:34.324
Looks like they bombed
a drive-in movie.

01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:09.166
He don't know it,
but he's going down

01:28:09.167 --> 01:28:11.521
a dead-end road, that dumb dickey.

01:28:12.365 --> 01:28:16.494
Look, Daddy. Uncle Gaylord and
Uncle Reggie are right behind us.

01:28:18.413 --> 01:28:21.415
I got him boxed in like
a turtle's pecker.

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.448
There's a gully on
the right and on the

01:28:23.449 --> 01:28:25.201
left and a mountain
in front of me.

01:28:25.295 --> 01:28:27.752
You want to tell me about
that front door again?

01:28:27.839 --> 01:28:30.627
Hey, brother truckers,
the Bandit's worried.

01:28:30.718 --> 01:28:34.467
He wants to get out of here.
Are you ready? Hello.

01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:45.685
Fred, don't look.

01:28:59.789 --> 01:29:02.197
He ain't the only daredevil.

01:29:07.923 --> 01:29:09.714
You guys give great bridge.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.754
That was beautiful,
drivers. I owe you one.

01:29:12.845 --> 01:29:14.802
Good numbers to you
and the Bandit.

01:29:14.888 --> 01:29:16.549
Say roger, Fred.

01:29:21.729 --> 01:29:24.351
You're not getting
away from me, Bandit.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:27.276
And I'm still in hot pursuit.

01:29:27.735 --> 01:29:31.650
I copy that, Buford. But I hear
your pursuit ain't that hot.

01:29:35.452 --> 01:29:37.160
Give me your handkerchief.

01:29:37.245 --> 01:29:39.701
- What?
- Give me your handkerchief.

01:29:48.507 --> 01:29:51.045
- What is it?
- A little fly shit.

01:29:52.469 --> 01:29:54.129
Daddy, look out.

01:30:01.645 --> 01:30:04.729
- Daddy?
- Shut up, Junior. I'm thinking.

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:07.808
What are you thinking about?

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:14.236
Retiring.

01:30:15.159 --> 01:30:17.282
Snowman, how's your patient?

01:30:17.703 --> 01:30:20.870
She ain't doing too good.
Doc says she's in labour.

01:30:20.957 --> 01:30:23.431
Bo, I ain't asking
you. I'm begging you.

01:30:23.432 --> 01:30:25.784
There's a place here.
Let's pull over.

01:30:25.878 --> 01:30:27.918
- 10-4.
- Attaboy.

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:40.821
It's one of those
guys from the park.

01:30:40.822 --> 01:30:42.894
Pay him off. Get him outta here.

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:45.518
Please, get my bag. Hurry up.

01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:47.477
Bring my bag.

01:30:49.236 --> 01:30:50.861
What the hell's going on here?

01:30:50.947 --> 01:30:53.900
- We're having a baby.
- This is a wildlife preserve.

01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:57.276
What better place to have a baby
elephant than a wildlife preserve?

01:30:57.369 --> 01:30:59.409
- You get your elephant...
- $100.

01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:01.490
- You get your people...
- $200.

01:31:01.582 --> 01:31:03.139
And you get the hell out of here.

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.140
$300.

01:31:04.141 --> 01:31:05.620
- $400.
- You're right.

01:31:06.337 --> 01:31:08.363
What better place to have a baby

01:31:08.364 --> 01:31:10.833
elephant than in a
wildlife preserve?

01:31:17.682 --> 01:31:19.177
What a putz.

01:31:37.286 --> 01:31:39.278
Snowflake, Bandito.

01:31:41.832 --> 01:31:45.082
Hey, cowboy. Look, Lone Ranger.

01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:49.498
It's a boy. First
I seen the trunk.

01:31:49.799 --> 01:31:52.290
All right, we've got six hours.

01:31:55.054 --> 01:31:58.257
Let's cut the Bambi shit. Load
her on the truck and get going.

01:31:58.349 --> 01:32:00.389
No. Lone Ranger, no can be.

01:32:00.476 --> 01:32:04.224
The bambino troppo delicate. It
cannot be removed from the mama.

01:32:04.313 --> 01:32:06.982
All right, we'll take
the mama and the baby.

01:32:07.066 --> 01:32:10.186
We'll put them both on the
truck and go to Dallas.

01:32:11.071 --> 01:32:13.526
When you give birth to a
200-pound elephant...

01:32:13.657 --> 01:32:16.230
you don't wanna go for a
ride. You wanna go...

01:32:16.326 --> 01:32:18.864
- She's strong as an ox.
- She is strong.

01:32:18.954 --> 01:32:21.160
She gotta wait till she
strong like an elephant.

01:32:21.248 --> 01:32:24.249
Bo, I know how much
you need the money.

01:32:24.918 --> 01:32:26.578
Who doesn't need the money?

01:32:26.670 --> 01:32:29.921
But let's don't do it this
way. It ain't decent.

01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:34.256
If you're through preaching,
Reverend, we're moving out.

01:32:34.386 --> 01:32:36.129
No, I ain't going.

01:32:36.555 --> 01:32:38.713
And you ain't going either.

01:32:40.268 --> 01:32:44.182
You just let your alligator mouth
overload your jaybird ass.

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.725
Doc, I thought I loved
him too much to do that.

01:32:49.819 --> 01:32:51.277
I guess not.

01:32:57.702 --> 01:32:59.908
You know I can take your
head off, don't you?

01:32:59.996 --> 01:33:02.783
And you know that's exactly
what you're gonna have to do.

01:33:02.874 --> 01:33:07.085
What is the matter with you two
idiots? You act like she's human.

01:33:41.163 --> 01:33:42.444
I'm sorry.

01:34:06.106 --> 01:34:08.229
I like myself now, Carrie.

01:34:11.195 --> 01:34:14.693
I found out there's something
more important than me.

01:34:15.449 --> 01:34:18.901
I found out there's nothing
more important than us.

01:34:20.204 --> 01:34:22.362
I didn't take Charlotte to Dallas.

01:34:23.207 --> 01:34:25.449
- You didn't?
- No.

01:34:25.584 --> 01:34:28.870
- What about Big Enos?
- Let him get his own date.

01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:34.003
- What about the money?
- I blew it.

01:34:36.554 --> 01:34:38.427
We still can make it.

01:34:41.517 --> 01:34:43.925
- We?
- Give me a chance.

01:34:48.691 --> 01:34:51.099
- Have you got over $1?
- Yeah.

01:34:51.653 --> 01:34:53.894
- Cash?
- Yeah.

01:34:54.739 --> 01:34:56.530
That's enough.

01:35:01.413 --> 01:35:04.082
You know what? We're
gonna have a problem.

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:06.870
Charlotte's gonna
be awfully jealous.

01:35:07.586 --> 01:35:09.875
I want to show you something.

01:35:19.807 --> 01:35:23.010
Charlotte had her baby.
You're a wonderful person.

01:35:23.102 --> 01:35:26.020
Charlotte. Look what you did.

01:35:26.105 --> 01:35:27.516
Hi, guys.

01:35:28.441 --> 01:35:32.937
Look at the baby. Charlotte,
what a good girl you are.

01:35:34.531 --> 01:35:37.733
Charlotte, is it all right
if Frog and I get hitched?

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:44.321
You see? It's better than the Good
Housekeeping Seal of Approval.

01:35:45.292 --> 01:35:48.376
Well, Bo, what do we do now?

01:35:49.504 --> 01:35:53.040
I think we ought to go back to
doing what I do best, show off.

01:35:53.967 --> 01:35:56.375
That's a 10-4, good buddies.

01:35:57.221 --> 01:35:59.759
- Shut up and get in the truck.
- Okay.

01:36:29.337 --> 01:36:31.911
You're not getting
away from me, Bandit.

01:36:32.007 --> 01:36:36.752
I'll chase you in hot pursuit
to the ends of the earth.

01:36:36.845 --> 01:36:38.968
You sumbitch.

01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:49.273
I guess we'll go back to doing
what I do best, show off.

01:36:50.192 --> 01:36:52.185
When do we get started?

01:36:52.278 --> 01:36:56.109
- When do we get started?
- That's my line.

01:36:56.198 --> 01:36:59.199
- You say, "Whenever you like."
- Whenever you like.

01:36:59.577 --> 01:37:01.590
Keep it rolling.
This is good stuff.

01:37:01.591 --> 01:37:02.591
I like this.

01:37:02.592 --> 01:37:06.120
I'll tell you what. We're gonna go
in town, we're gonna listen to...

01:37:06.208 --> 01:37:08.995
Let's do that again. I'm screwing
up. You keep it rolling.

01:37:09.086 --> 01:37:11.044
He's doing great.
I'm... Here we go.

01:37:11.131 --> 01:37:13.965
You didn't waste any time
dilly-dallying around...

01:37:14.049 --> 01:37:15.461
with other people when...

01:37:15.551 --> 01:37:18.221
I'm gonna pick that up
again. I got it. It's okay.

01:37:18.304 --> 01:37:20.511
Damn, that son of a
bitch never gives up.

01:37:20.807 --> 01:37:23.428
That's right. Now what do I say?

01:37:23.518 --> 01:37:26.389
- 71, take two.
- 71, take two, camera B.

01:37:26.897 --> 01:37:28.474
Oh, my clicker won't work.

01:37:28.565 --> 01:37:29.893
Marker.

01:37:30.233 --> 01:37:32.314
Tell Gregory Peck
that he needs to do

01:37:32.315 --> 01:37:34.231
this for me. I forgot the... line.

01:37:34.321 --> 01:37:36.479
I'll tell you one thing, though.

01:37:36.573 --> 01:37:39.064
I am holding up my endorsement...

01:37:39.368 --> 01:37:42.120
until one or the
other of you can...

01:37:42.204 --> 01:37:44.742
I'm what you call your
household legend.

01:37:44.832 --> 01:37:47.786
Your basic legend.
Your basic famous.

01:37:47.918 --> 01:37:49.662
I'll just say that line again.

01:37:49.754 --> 01:37:51.461
Get in the truck.

01:37:52.506 --> 01:37:55.424
I'll tell her again.
Get in the truck.

01:37:56.135 --> 01:37:58.673
Charlotte. Hop in the truck.

01:37:59.013 --> 01:38:00.556
Hop.

01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:04.095
- In the house.
- Don't push the truck.

01:38:04.226 --> 01:38:06.468
In the house, Charlotte.

01:38:06.687 --> 01:38:08.680
You're pushing the
truck to Georgia.

01:38:08.772 --> 01:38:10.565
Come on.

01:38:10.650 --> 01:38:13.320
That's right, you old fart.
Go the wrong way. This way.

01:38:13.403 --> 01:38:16.190
- Here we go. Pick it up.
- Hold it. Steady.

01:38:16.281 --> 01:38:19.531
If I was Clint Eastwood,
you'd say, "Pick Clint up."

01:38:19.617 --> 01:38:22.702
Doctor, why don't we just
keep driving to Texas...

01:38:22.787 --> 01:38:25.824
and you give her an
examination up in the truck?

01:38:25.916 --> 01:38:30.079
Oh, Jesus. I'm missing
my wife so bad.

01:38:33.549 --> 01:38:36.965
Do you wanna... him while
we got him down here?

01:38:37.385 --> 01:38:40.671
I was the leading
gynaecologist in Pompeii.

01:38:44.602 --> 01:38:47.307
Snowman. I've had
about it all's...

01:38:47.647 --> 01:38:48.891
You dumb Indian.

01:38:48.981 --> 01:38:50.938
Fred, just relax, son.

01:38:51.233 --> 01:38:53.605
It ain't nearly as
bad as it looks.

01:38:54.195 --> 01:38:56.602
Get up in there, you
son of a bitch.

01:38:59.617 --> 01:39:02.488
Get in there, you
silly son of a bitch.

01:39:02.579 --> 01:39:05.865
- You got any diesel fuel?
- If I had any more diesel fuel...

01:39:05.956 --> 01:39:08.744
I'd have to join that APEC, OPEC.

01:39:09.586 --> 01:39:11.293
I'll give it to you again.

01:39:11.379 --> 01:39:14.831
Do you realise I won the
marksmanship award?

01:39:15.091 --> 01:39:17.000
Your father's ass.

01:39:17.177 --> 01:39:20.261
Longer than three months
and your mother's ass.

01:39:20.347 --> 01:39:21.924
But shorter than three years.

01:39:22.057 --> 01:39:25.556
Sure, put her in the truck.
Bounce the "Raby" around.

01:39:26.645 --> 01:39:29.219
Don't make no difference.
Put her in the truck.

01:39:29.315 --> 01:39:32.434
Bounce the "Raby" around...
Your mother's ass.

01:39:34.653 --> 01:39:38.817
Sure, la signora Charlotte
can do anything she wants.

01:39:38.908 --> 01:39:41.779
Put her in the truck.
Bounce the "Raby"...

01:39:41.869 --> 01:39:43.778
- Your mother's ass.
- Keep it rolling.

01:39:43.871 --> 01:39:45.579
This lady gonna have a baby...

01:39:45.664 --> 01:39:48.008
and not gonna be moved for 24...

01:39:48.009 --> 01:39:49.009
Cut it.

01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:51.245
I think we should ask this doctor.

01:39:51.337 --> 01:39:55.122
Do you think we should move
Charlotte or let her rest or what?

01:39:55.217 --> 01:39:58.834
I can't stand it. I'm sorry.

01:39:58.928 --> 01:40:00.471
Okay. Come on.

01:40:00.639 --> 01:40:01.753
Now.

01:40:03.266 --> 01:40:05.935
Well, why don't we ask
this doctor here?

01:40:06.019 --> 01:40:10.017
Do you think we should move
Charlotte or let her rest or what?

01:40:10.858 --> 01:40:13.183
The lady gonna have a baby...

01:40:13.277 --> 01:40:15.898
- Cut it.
- All right. Save it.

01:40:15.988 --> 01:40:19.356
We'll start doing what I
do best. We'll show off.

01:40:20.075 --> 01:40:23.160
- When do we get started?
- Whenever you like.

01:40:24.162 --> 01:40:25.823
Is now too soon?
