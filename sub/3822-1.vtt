00:54.387 --> 00:55.688
Hi.

00:55.689 --> 00:59.692
I'm Sam Turner and we're here at VICE
Headquarters in Williamsburg, Brooklyn

00:59.693 --> 01:01.694
with one of our favorite
fashion photographers,

01:01.695 --> 01:04.697
Just a few nights ago, we
were all hanging out together

01:04.697 --> 01:08.768
when he let slip a comment about his
sister that had us practically speechless

01:08.769 --> 01:10.270
for the better part of an hour.

01:10.271 --> 01:15.040
After hearing the full story, we immediately
thought, we have got to do a piece on it.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.233
Should I read it?

01:40.234 --> 01:41.468
Read it.

01:41.469 --> 01:45.205
Okay, it says, "Dear Patrick, sorry you
have not heard from me in so long.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.974
I have been working hard with
everyone to build a community

01:47.975 --> 01:50.243
where we can finally live
free as God intended.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.445
We're not there yet,
but we're so close.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.982
It's the most beautiful place I have ever
been and I would love if you came to visit.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.517
We have so much love here
but I miss your face."

01:59.319 --> 02:01.800
Then it says "Love, Caroline,"
and there's a phone number.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.352
We've been to some
of the most chaotic,

02:32.353 --> 02:34.754
fucked up, war-torn
places in the world,

02:34.755 --> 02:39.659
but never somewhere for something
as personal and bizarre as this.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.028
So here we are, about
to leave New York City,

02:42.029 --> 02:45.632
to set out to find your sister
in a remote part of the world,

02:45.633 --> 02:48.935
to see what this community she is
living in is really all about.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.503
Maybe we can call this one

02:50.504 --> 02:53.271
the "VICE guide to the
Carter family reunion".

I'll be back tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

05:10.678 --> 05:13.513
I'll wait for one hour
and then I will leave.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.947
With or without you.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.516
Don't worry, we'll be here.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.084
I'm not worried.
8:00 a.m.

05:31.798 --> 05:32.832
Who is Patrick?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.599
Yeah.
That's me.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.103
We were not told you'd
be bringing others.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.840
There are three total.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.542
Is there a problem?
We're all together.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.610
We have to get clearance to
bring them to the Parish.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.444
Please, stop filming me, sir.

05:49.982 --> 05:51.984
They came with me.
I can't just leave them here.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.320
My sister invited us.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.689
My sister's name is
Caroline Carter.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.990
Hold on.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.058
I don't understand
if there's problem.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.326
Hold on.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.893
It should be all arranged.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.332
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Bring them in.</i>

06:06.333 --> 06:07.500
Copy that.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.267
It's okay.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.637
Come with me.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.271
Let's go.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.243
It's okay.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.145
Get in the back.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.646
The truck?

06:20.647 --> 06:22.147
Get in the back.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.538
So far so good.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.631
Well, here we are,
we made it, kind of.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.199
We don't have a local
fixer on this one,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.267
and the first thing that happens is

07:14.268 --> 07:16.702
Patrick almost getting into an
argument with one of our guides.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.204
You know those are the
guys you want on your side

07:18.205 --> 07:20.072
when you are out in
places like this.

07:20.073 --> 07:23.309
Maybe New York has made me soft,
but these are the moments,

07:23.310 --> 07:25.578
every time we make one of
these things, where I realize

07:25.579 --> 07:26.979
it might have been
the worst idea ever.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.681
No, we've definitely
had worse ideas.

07:31.784 --> 07:32.952
I don't know why you're laughing.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.053
Get a shot of his shoes.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.824
Where did you think you were
going, wearing shoes like those?

07:37.825 --> 07:39.659
I thought you traveled
for work all the time?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.928
Yeah, to LA, and fucking Paris.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.095
Closest I come to this shit

07:43.096 --> 07:45.164
is shooting some model
in a field in Jersey.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.866
Dude, you're in fashion,
you should own some boots.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.892
Turn the camera off!

08:17.196 --> 08:18.865
Turn it off!

08:18.866 --> 08:20.732
Turn it off!

08:29.775 --> 08:33.145
So things have not improved.

08:33.145 --> 08:37.350
We didn't get shot, but
we have to be careful

08:37.351 --> 08:39.784
not to let them catch us filming.

08:39.785 --> 08:43.523
Patrick is over there explaining
who we are, what we're doing.

08:43.524 --> 08:47.659
I'm not sure if that will
make things better or worse.

08:48.494 --> 08:51.930
We're hoping that he can find his
sister and straighten all this out.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.302
And if Patrick starts to get shot
at, I'm going the fuck that way.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.169
As quickly as possible.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.807
They want our passports,

09:01.808 --> 09:05.011
but I'm not giving up
my passport to anybody.

09:05.012 --> 09:08.748
Also, there is some
talk of a donation.

09:08.749 --> 09:12.151
Not sure how sizeable
that donation has to be.

09:12.152 --> 09:16.321
So far this is nothing at all like the
hippie commune we were expecting.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.658
Patrick?

09:18.659 --> 09:19.926
Okay.
See, there she is.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.026
Hey, it's okay guys.
It's okay.

09:23.029 --> 09:27.432
Caroline, did you tell them?
All right, come on guys.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.072
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.441
I'm so glad to see you.
What's with all this?

09:35.442 --> 09:38.177
Oh, I'll explain it inside.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.211
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.213
I'm Caroline.
Nice to meet you.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.282
You too.
I'm Sam, this is Jake.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.418
Hi.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.587
We didn't know you were coming.
I'm so sorry.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.088
It's just... We're really
happy to have you.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.357
There's someone cleaning out
a cabin right now for you both.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.425
Great.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.961
Is it all right if I keep filming?

09:54.962 --> 09:56.696
Yeah.
Yeah, of course, of course.

09:56.697 --> 10:01.467
I would just hope that you would
leave this last experience out.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.370
It in no way reflects what
you are about to see.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.373
The guns are just a precautionary
measure because of where we are.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.742
Down here everything needs
some level of security.

10:09.743 --> 10:10.743
Sure, we understand.

10:10.744 --> 10:11.744
You want to go inside?

10:11.745 --> 10:12.745
Yeah. Yeah.

10:12.746 --> 10:13.746
Yeah? Okay, cool.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.213
Thanks, guys.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.990
My God, I can't believe I'm
looking at you right now.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.758
Your hair is so short.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.326
Yeah, I cut it.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.761
You look good.
You look healthy.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.096
Thank you.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.497
I can't believe this is
where you are living.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.766
Oh, just wait until you see it all.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.636
Here we are.
Welcome to Eden Parish.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.004
What do you think?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.338
It's great, right?

10:39.339 --> 10:45.344
<i>Children, we have some special
visitors to the parish today.</i>

10:45.345 --> 10:47.480
<i>Let's show them our hospitality</i>

10:47.481 --> 10:50.616
<i>and represent ourselves in the
ways the Lord has taught us.</i>

10:50.617 --> 10:52.985
<i>- God bless you all.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.922
I don't think that we slept more
than three hours in a night

10:56.923 --> 10:59.291
for six months when
we were building it.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.795
But Father had a vision, and
he was of course right.

11:02.796 --> 11:06.431
And we built Heaven here on Earth.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.035
Who is Father?

11:09.036 --> 11:10.770
Oh, right.
Yeah.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.506
Probably sounds weird
to you guys, huh?

11:13.507 --> 11:16.642
Well, he's the guy that
started all of this.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.177
He's the reason that
I'm still alive.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.680
He's the reason that
all of us are here.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.149
He's a genius, I swear.

11:23.150 --> 11:27.453
I know it sounds strange, but we all call
him that because it's just easier for us.

11:27.454 --> 11:28.954
Is that him on the loud speaker?

11:28.955 --> 11:30.556
Uh-huh.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.058
Can we speak with
him at some point?

11:32.059 --> 11:33.893
Um.

11:33.894 --> 11:37.663
I know you guys are Patrick's
friends and everything,

11:37.664 --> 11:40.199
but we've got to be really
careful about media exposure.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.536
None of this would be possible
without some level of secrecy.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.471
Secrecy, from whom?

11:45.472 --> 11:46.572
People like us?

11:46.573 --> 11:48.708
Or you mean like the
local government?

11:48.709 --> 11:51.310
A little of both.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.480
There are some people out there
that want to stop what we're doing.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.316
They think it's wrong, but
I personally have no idea

11:57.317 --> 11:59.819
why anyone would think
that this was wrong.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.854
I've never been so happy
in my entire life,

12:01.855 --> 12:04.824
and we grew up wealthy
on the upper west side.

12:04.825 --> 12:08.360
But that's not living, at least not to me.
This is living.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.596
We all built this
together as a community.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.964
We would do anything
to keep it safe.

12:17.103 --> 12:20.506
So some of our residents
agreed to move out of here

12:20.507 --> 12:24.076
so that you guys could
stay here with us tonight,

12:24.077 --> 12:27.079
but Patrick is going to stay
with me in the main house.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.381
And I know it doesn't
seem like much,

12:29.382 --> 12:31.751
but you guys should be pretty
comfortable for the night.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.385
When we first got here, some
of our residents said that

12:33.386 --> 12:35.721
they had the best
sleep of their lives.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.023
It's so peaceful and just
wait until you see the stars.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.392
They're so beautiful.
It's great, thank you.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.962
Should we come find you
once we get settled?

12:42.963 --> 12:45.898
We would actually like to talk to you
at some point if you're cool with that.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.401
Just... but take your time
because I would really

12:49.402 --> 12:51.237
love to spend some
time with my brother.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.671
Take him, we can't give him away.

12:54.406 --> 12:57.143
But really, if you guys need
anything at all, anything,

12:57.144 --> 13:00.546
the main house is just across the
field, just behind that pavilion.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.747
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.383
Feel free to just wander around and
get acquainted with the place.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.252
Our residents are
really nice people.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.386
Sounds good.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.554
Mm-hmm.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.156
- You ready?
- Yeah.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.157
Well, welcome.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.925
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.795
Okay, I guess I'm going
to go with her for a bit.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.819
All right.
See you in a few.

13:17.820 --> 13:19.589
Later.
See you, man.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.041
You want the top or bottom?

13:37.183 --> 13:39.084
She's selling this
place pretty hard.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.953
Right?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.788
Best night's sleep of your life...

13:42.789 --> 13:44.288
Yeah.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.196
How freaked out were
you back on the truck?

13:50.197 --> 13:51.696
Dude.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.232
Why did they have machine guns?

13:56.602 --> 13:58.604
I'm gonna switch cards so
if anything gets weird,

13:58.605 --> 14:00.339
we at least have the
footage we shot so far.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.106
Good call.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.994
<i>Peace I give you, children.</i>

14:21.995 --> 14:24.129
<i>Do not let your hearts be troubled.</i>

14:24.130 --> 14:25.831
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

14:25.832 --> 14:29.134
<i>It's another day for us in paradise.</i>

14:29.135 --> 14:30.135
Hi.

14:30.136 --> 14:34.340
<i>When brothers and
sisters live in unity.</i>

14:34.341 --> 14:35.574
<i>God bless you all.</i>

14:35.575 --> 14:37.141
Hi.

14:39.745 --> 14:43.414
I do not know who
to approach first.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.517
They'll come to me.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.251
Hey, how you doing?

14:48.587 --> 14:51.022
Not that one, I guess.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.298
Oh, got her.
Got her.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.172
Hi.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.507
Hi.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.508
How are you?

15:09.509 --> 15:10.676
I'm fine.
How about yourself?

15:10.677 --> 15:11.677
I'm very well.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.879
My name is Lorraine Davis,

15:13.880 --> 15:16.749
but everyone around here
just calls me Miss D.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.918
So how did you get
involved with this place?

15:18.919 --> 15:20.185
Through the church.

15:20.186 --> 15:23.789
Now Father had came into
the area where we lived

15:23.790 --> 15:28.560
and I had seen signs
plastered all around town.

15:28.561 --> 15:34.033
Signs inviting people to come out
and to help better themselves

15:34.034 --> 15:37.703
and to get a better
relationship with God.

15:37.704 --> 15:41.440
So I went down there to the church

15:41.441 --> 15:45.311
and before that sermon
was over, I was sold.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.714
That man has a way of speaking,

15:48.715 --> 15:54.053
a way of making you just feel better,
and I'd never felt that way before.

15:54.054 --> 15:58.090
And it wasn't long
after that he chose me

15:58.091 --> 16:00.326
to be one of the lucky ones

16:00.327 --> 16:03.462
to come down here and be
a part of all of this.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.597
Oh, were you reluctant
to leave your home?

16:05.598 --> 16:06.966
Oh, no.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.600
After my husband had passed,

16:08.601 --> 16:13.237
there just wasn't
anything here for me.

16:14.473 --> 16:19.445
My faith is what was
most important.

16:19.446 --> 16:23.381
This is right where I belong.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.586
We're with VICE.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.255
We want to talk with someone around our
age about what it's like living here.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.256
I know VICE.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.492
Cool.
Are you from Australia?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.860
Melbourne, yeah.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.862
How did you end up here?

16:36.863 --> 16:39.965
I mean, what were you doing
before you came to this place?

16:39.966 --> 16:41.867
I was an artist living in Brooklyn.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.102
What kind of art do you do?

16:43.103 --> 16:44.370
All kinds.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.839
Painting, poetry, performance.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.009
Do you ever miss the technology
you were accustomed to?

16:50.010 --> 16:52.378
Even just communicating easier

16:52.379 --> 16:54.380
or knowing what's going on
with the outside world?

16:54.381 --> 16:56.382
You must, a little bit?

16:56.383 --> 16:58.617
I don't need the
internet to communicate.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.153
People lived without it
for thousands of years.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.856
It's just another
unhealthy addiction.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.791
Here we talk to each other in
person, not through satellites.

17:06.792 --> 17:10.128
What about your
family in Australia?

17:10.130 --> 17:11.561
Do they know where you are?

17:12.397 --> 17:15.000
This is my family now.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.301
Father has given me more
than I ever dreamed of.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.538
I'm so grateful for that.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.173
Okay.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.308
Fair enough.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.909
Thanks.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.053
Oh, hi.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.687
Hi.
Can we come in?

17:35.688 --> 17:37.890
Sure.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.825
What is this place?

17:39.826 --> 17:44.830
This is our medical center and
temporarily our day-care.

17:44.831 --> 17:51.203
I help with any conditions our residents
may have, especially our seniors.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.339
And Miss Phoebe in there helps
takes care of some of the children

17:54.340 --> 17:56.442
while their parents
are in the fields.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.444
Are there a lot of
children and seniors here?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.045
Oh, yes.

18:00.046 --> 18:04.083
We have over 35 boys and
girls under the age of 10,

18:04.084 --> 18:08.053
and at least 60 or so seniors.

18:08.054 --> 18:11.489
That's how our parish really got
its start, helping those seniors.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.593
Has anyone actually been born here?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.729
Oh, we've birthed
seven babies to date.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.464
Seven?
All here?

18:21.233 --> 18:23.067
That's right.
Right here.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.372
Why are you so surprised?

18:27.373 --> 18:31.977
People are born around the world every
day in conditions worse than this.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.447
It's not the hospital that has
the baby, it's the mother.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.882
He's just nervous because
his wife's pregnant.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.220
Really?
When is she due?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.387
Next month.

18:42.388 --> 18:43.388
Is this your first?

18:43.389 --> 18:44.389
Yeah.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.492
The first are the most exciting.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.626
Congratulations.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.262
Thank you.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.464
Where do all these
supplies come from?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.465
Do you get them locally?

18:53.466 --> 18:55.601
Well, we brought a lot with us,

18:55.602 --> 18:59.004
but thank heavens we haven't needed
to use much of the medication.

18:59.005 --> 19:03.475
But we are prepared for
all types of emergencies.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.777
Who pays for it all?

19:05.778 --> 19:07.746
We did.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.150
Well, in so many words, anyway.

19:11.151 --> 19:16.755
When many of us first came to the
parish, we sold everything we had.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.492
When several hundred people come
together, you would be surprised

19:20.493 --> 19:22.861
that how much you can
get accomplished.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.531
Everyone just gave up what
they had to come here?

19:25.532 --> 19:27.166
That's right.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.369
We sold our homes and we donated
the profits to the church.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.703
And we would do it again.

19:33.872 --> 19:39.311
Father is a businessman
on top of all things.

19:39.312 --> 19:42.713
Sometimes that gets overlooked.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.965
- So where are you guys from?
- Oh, we're from the hood, man.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.033
Yeah.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.334
I'm saying we had nothing
where we was from.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.836
You know, five of us
lived in two rooms.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.171
And that's how you want to live?

20:06.172 --> 20:08.340
Me, Robert, our mother
and two sisters,

20:08.341 --> 20:10.342
we all came down here together.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.477
And I mean, honestly,
it's just changed us.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.179
We're from a violent community.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.581
I don't know, man.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.816
If we didn't come down here,

20:17.817 --> 20:18.917
God knows what would
have happened to us.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.419
Oh, yeah, yeah, if you had told us

20:20.420 --> 20:23.222
we'll be out there with the white
dudes and all these people...

20:23.223 --> 20:25.122
Yeah, yeah.
We'd just say you was crazy.

20:26.058 --> 20:30.495
It's like, we look at you all and
it's like you are the crazy ones.

20:30.496 --> 20:31.997
Yeah.
I mean...

20:31.998 --> 20:33.432
This is how we're
supposed to be living.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.601
You know, everybody
here is in it together.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.602
That's right.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.836
You know, there's no
one man for himself,

20:37.837 --> 20:39.371
it's like God watches over us.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.006
Yeah.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.507
- We watch over each other.
- That's right, man.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.877
Do you see yourself ever going
back to the United States?

20:45.878 --> 20:47.512
Never.
There's no point.

20:47.513 --> 20:50.215
I ain't never going back, man.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.717
I'd die before I go back.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.019
It's real.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.121
Hey, can I play some
ball with you guys?

20:56.122 --> 20:57.256
Yeah, man.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.257
Come on.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.725
Can he ball?
He can really ball.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.292
No.

21:32.157 --> 21:34.059
<i>So we talked to a bunch
of the people here</i>

21:34.060 --> 21:36.662
<i>and what we know so far
is that everyone thinks</i>

21:36.663 --> 21:39.131
<i>this is the best place
they've ever been.</i>

21:39.132 --> 21:41.066
<i>They have their own farming,
their own medical center,</i>

21:41.067 --> 21:43.435
<i>their own daycare,
their own everything.</i>

21:43.436 --> 21:45.070
<i>As far as utopias go,</i>

21:45.071 --> 21:46.905
<i>it has something for everybody.</i>

21:46.906 --> 21:49.308
If it's spirituality
you want, they got it.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.810
If it's progressive
politics, they got it.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.179
If it's a technology
free hippy lifestyle

21:54.180 --> 21:56.682
you're looking for,
they got that, too.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.950
I can't help but think desperation

21:58.951 --> 22:00.819
is a lot of what
brought people here,

22:00.820 --> 22:04.788
but if they're happy now,
who am I to say anything?

22:05.590 --> 22:07.526
We're about to head
to the main house

22:07.527 --> 22:09.194
to meet back up with
Patrick and Caroline

22:09.195 --> 22:13.332
to see if we can do an interview with
this Father everyone keeps talking about.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.601
I'm trying to keep it together, so
I can ask intelligent questions,

22:16.602 --> 22:20.971
but jet lag's kicked in and
I am starting to melt.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.543
Jake, what do you think
of all this so far?

22:24.544 --> 22:28.212
Give me your
professional assessment.

22:31.116 --> 22:32.984
Um, I don't know.

22:32.985 --> 22:36.120
I mean, I'm naturally
cynical, but...

22:39.624 --> 22:42.227
The fact that a bunch of
drug addicts and alcoholics

22:42.228 --> 22:45.329
actually pulled this thing together
is a little bit impressive.

22:46.732 --> 22:50.234
Fact that they sold all their
worldly possessions to do it.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.605
I don't know, just throws up the
red flag for me a little bit.

22:55.374 --> 23:00.078
I feel like, I mean, if this
is like a place to come

23:00.079 --> 23:03.515
and get clean or do a little
bit of thinking for a month,

23:03.516 --> 23:05.150
it's perfect.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.353
I think it is an actual
sustainable lifestyle for,

23:08.354 --> 23:12.257
you know, 60 something
elderly people.

23:12.258 --> 23:14.259
I mean, that medical
center is great,

23:14.260 --> 23:19.496
but that's not really going to cut
it, in my professional opinion.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.173
What are you gonna ask this guy?

23:28.174 --> 23:29.773
I don't know yet.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.677
Are you going in
with tough questions

23:32.678 --> 23:35.145
or you're just gonna wait
and see what the vibe is?

23:36.047 --> 23:37.916
I'm coming at him.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.284
Okay.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.553
Well, I'm gonna see
if he'll wear a wire,

23:41.554 --> 23:43.554
gonna try and mic you guys up.

23:48.126 --> 23:50.194
Sam, we got a little one.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.269
Hi.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.937
What's your name?

23:58.938 --> 24:01.807
Savannah.
There you are.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.942
Well, I've been looking
all over for you.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.577
Hi, Savannah.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.279
Don't mind her.
She is a mute.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.313
Oh.

24:08.314 --> 24:09.714
You friends of Caroline's?

24:09.715 --> 24:11.583
Yeah.
We're with VICE.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.544
We want to maybe do a
story about this place.

24:14.319 --> 24:15.654
What kind of a story?

24:15.655 --> 24:17.823
We don't really know yet.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.458
You're not gonna make
fun of us, are you?

24:19.459 --> 24:20.926
No, not at all.

24:20.927 --> 24:23.962
We were just saying how
impressive all this is.

24:23.963 --> 24:27.299
Hey, would you mind doing
a quick interview?

24:27.300 --> 24:29.334
We talked with a few people
about how they ended up here

24:29.335 --> 24:31.436
and it'd be great if we could get

24:31.437 --> 24:33.972
- a mother's perspective on that.
- No, thank you.

24:33.973 --> 24:39.444
We're not allowed to talk about the
Parish, especially to outsiders.

24:39.445 --> 24:41.111
Come on, sweetheart.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.351
Did she just call us outsiders?

24:46.352 --> 24:47.885
Yeah.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.493
It's kind of a different vibe, huh?

24:54.494 --> 24:55.893
Yeah.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.674
Hey.

25:09.675 --> 25:10.675
Hey.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.810
How are you doing?

25:11.811 --> 25:13.345
I'll see you guys later.

25:13.346 --> 25:14.779
You guys enjoying
yourselves so far?

25:14.780 --> 25:15.780
Definitely.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.516
Yeah?
So good news.

25:17.517 --> 25:20.552
I spoke with Father and he agreed
to allow you an interview.

25:20.553 --> 25:21.620
- Great.
- Yeah.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.788
He is not really feeling
very well right now.

25:23.789 --> 25:26.224
He just took some of his medication.
Oh, is he sick?

25:26.225 --> 25:27.792
No.
It's nothing serious.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.629
It's just sometimes the
medication upsets his stomach.

25:30.630 --> 25:34.299
So he agreed to sit for an interview
tonight at the gathering.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.368
We're planning an
event for your visit.

25:36.369 --> 25:40.405
It's gonna be music and dancing,
you'll love it, especially you.

25:40.406 --> 25:45.176
So we would love it if you would
look over this document I prepared.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.812
It'll give you a little bit
more information about us

25:47.813 --> 25:49.814
and it should help
with your questions.

25:49.815 --> 25:53.016
He is only gonna sit for half an
hour and then the party will begin.

25:53.818 --> 25:55.253
What time does the party start?

25:55.254 --> 25:57.055
It begins at sun down.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.925
If you just want to meet me
in front of the pavilion,

25:59.926 --> 26:01.326
and then I'll take
care of the rest.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.327
Perfect.
Thank you.

26:02.328 --> 26:03.428
Okay.
Of course.

26:03.429 --> 26:04.896
We have nothing to hide.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.031
So if you'll excuse me,

26:06.032 --> 26:08.333
I have some more planning
to do before tonight,

26:08.334 --> 26:09.534
so I'll just see you
guys in a little bit.

26:09.535 --> 26:10.535
Sounds good.

26:10.536 --> 26:11.570
Okay.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.604
- Yeah. Thanks, Caroline.
- Mm-hmm.

26:15.707 --> 26:17.075
How is it going, man?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.344
Man, I got some amazing
pictures so far, dude.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.612
I can make a whole
book out of this.

26:22.847 --> 26:25.183
Look at these faces, man.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.617
Jesus.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.721
You know, I can make something
really cool out of this

26:29.722 --> 26:31.556
and it'd be great for me, 'cause
then I could set up a show

26:31.557 --> 26:32.857
with Milt when I get back.

26:32.858 --> 26:34.324
That's right.

26:35.727 --> 26:38.629
Oh, no, that's what my ticket
on fashion looks like.

26:40.231 --> 26:41.232
What have you guys been up to?

26:41.233 --> 26:44.134
Well, we talked to a
bunch of the locals.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.471
- And?
- It's pretty wild.

26:46.472 --> 26:48.974
Yeah.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.874
Strange group of people.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.211
Nah, it's incredible.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.616
Had a few bizarre
interactions, but you know...

26:57.617 --> 27:01.620
Where I'm staying, a full extra bedroom,
office, can't even wrap my head around it.

27:01.621 --> 27:05.590
The construction aspect is pretty
impressive I have to admit.

27:05.591 --> 27:09.761
Do you think your... Do you think
your sister wants to stay?

27:09.762 --> 27:10.795
It seems like it.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.131
I thought I was gonna have
to come here and rescue her

27:13.132 --> 27:15.634
but she seems good and she's
definitely done worse.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.735
I don't know how I'm gonna describe
this to my parents, but...

27:19.638 --> 27:22.507
Um, we're rolling, so
let's do that letter.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.174
All right.

27:31.016 --> 27:32.751
"Distinguished guests..."

27:32.752 --> 27:36.021
Well, does it say
distinguished guests?

27:36.022 --> 27:38.023
Says it.

27:38.024 --> 27:40.025
"Welcome to Eden Parish.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.760
Father wants only to
create a community

27:41.761 --> 27:43.662
where peace and love are cherished,

27:43.663 --> 27:46.865
where the needs of one another are met on
equal levels as we're all God's children

27:46.866 --> 27:49.300
and it is how He Himself
intended us to live.

27:49.301 --> 27:52.037
We do not seek to isolate
ourselves from the outside world,

27:52.038 --> 27:55.807
but we do seek a distance from
imperialism, violence, poverty, racism

27:55.808 --> 27:59.010
and all other unacceptable
attacks on basic human rights.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.447
These conditions have all become
commonplace in modern societies.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.683
Father created Eden Parish
not as a place to get away,

28:04.684 --> 28:06.317
but as a place to start over.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.452
It is a new beginning.

28:07.453 --> 28:11.189
Sincerely, the loving
congregation of Eden Parish."

28:11.190 --> 28:13.825
Define imperialism.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.726
Define imperialism.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.595
Idiots.

28:23.301 --> 28:24.836
You're getting a signal?

28:24.837 --> 28:26.103
No.

28:26.838 --> 28:28.206
Okay.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.728
What are you doing on your phone?

28:31.543 --> 28:36.047
Dude, she is still gonna be pregnant
tomorrow when you get home.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.682
They might have a satellite
phone in the office.

28:37.683 --> 28:39.350
They don't have a satellite
phone in the office.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.854
You know, you don't need to
encourage this kind of behavior.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.355
Okay but I saw a room
with a lot of equipment.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.757
He is fine.
You're fine.

28:57.202 --> 28:58.603
<i>Would all Parish members</i>

28:58.604 --> 29:01.740
<i>please report to the
pavilion no later than 7:45.</i>

29:01.741 --> 29:04.843
<i>We're having a very
special meeting tonight,</i>

29:04.844 --> 29:06.745
<i>for Father and our visitors.</i>

29:06.746 --> 29:08.513
<i>Everyone is required to attend.</i>

29:08.514 --> 29:10.380
<i>God bless.</i>

29:21.259 --> 29:23.728
So we're gonna have you
guys set up over here

29:23.729 --> 29:26.030
and then Father will come out
when you guys are ready.

29:26.031 --> 29:28.133
Wait, hold up.
We're doing this in front of everybody?

29:28.134 --> 29:30.268
Yeah.
That's right.

29:30.269 --> 29:34.304
Great. So just let me know
when you're all set, okay?

29:38.743 --> 29:39.744
Hey, Patrick?

29:39.745 --> 29:40.745
Yeah.

29:40.746 --> 29:41.913
Hey, man, does your
camera shoot video?

29:41.914 --> 29:43.548
Yeah.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.917
Think you could help me get some...
during this?

29:45.918 --> 29:47.552
Definitely.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.553
Where do you want me to shoot from?

29:52.123 --> 29:54.259
I mean, anywhere where you
can get a good shot of Sam

29:54.260 --> 29:58.396
asking some questions and
then you can flip around

29:58.397 --> 30:00.932
and get some shots of
people, that'd be awesome.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.634
All right, maybe I'll
just set up over here.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.267
Yeah.
Thanks, man.

30:08.439 --> 30:11.208
Well, light looks pretty good.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.460
Father's here!

31:55.613 --> 31:57.115
Hi.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.882
Nice to meet you.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.255
Yeah.
All right, all right.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.057
Let me get rigged up here.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.293
All right.
All right.

32:08.294 --> 32:12.797
Well, I trust your stay so
far has been hospitable.

32:12.798 --> 32:16.200
What we lack in modern comfort,
we make up for in humanity.

32:16.201 --> 32:17.201
Isn't that right?

32:22.440 --> 32:23.942
It's been pretty amazing.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.777
Everyone we talked to
seems to feel that

32:25.778 --> 32:27.312
this is everything they ever wanted

32:27.313 --> 32:28.646
and they all credit you for that.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.815
Oh, I don't deserve the credit.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.951
We all did this together.

32:32.952 --> 32:36.087
We built this place
from the ground up.

32:36.088 --> 32:39.324
This is our community and
you being our visitors,

32:39.325 --> 32:41.092
it is just as much yours.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.559
That's what we believe in.

32:44.595 --> 32:45.830
I want to talk more about that,

32:45.831 --> 32:48.466
but I would love to get some
basics out of the way first.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.102
Caroline mentioned you were
little under the whether earlier,

32:51.103 --> 32:52.971
so I hope this is not too much.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.605
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

32:54.606 --> 32:55.840
Great.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.810
Okay, so first off.
Can I ask your real name?

32:58.811 --> 33:02.447
Everybody here has been calling you
Father and I wonder how that started.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.381
Well, it's a nickname.

33:05.450 --> 33:08.987
I don't remember exactly when it
started, but it was many years ago.

33:08.988 --> 33:12.957
Some people see anyone who
extends a helping hand

33:12.958 --> 33:14.492
as a father figure.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.961
And yes, that's where it came from.

33:16.962 --> 33:20.765
My given name is
Charles Anderson Reed.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.333
That's a great name.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.870
Where are you from and how
did all of this get started?

33:25.871 --> 33:27.138
Can you take us through it?

33:27.139 --> 33:30.875
Oh, I am from all over, friend.

33:30.876 --> 33:33.778
I've been in every big
city and every small town.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.147
And you know what I found?

33:36.148 --> 33:42.919
Poverty, violence,
greed and racism.

33:44.155 --> 33:47.625
The foundations of a
cancerous society

33:47.626 --> 33:49.160
and I felt it to make a difference.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.896
You see all these
people here tonight?

33:51.897 --> 33:55.666
They all came here because
they had nothing.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.002
They were born outcast.

33:58.003 --> 33:59.871
Never given a chance.

33:59.872 --> 34:02.173
I know, 'cause so was I.

34:02.174 --> 34:08.679
Society turned its back on these
people years ago, but I never will.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.648
I grew up poor.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.417
I know that pain.

34:12.418 --> 34:17.155
I know what it's like to
lose hope, to feel trapped.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.056
Well, there's none of that here.

34:19.058 --> 34:21.426
You come down here and I'll
give you a place to live.

34:21.427 --> 34:24.929
I'll give you a job, I'll give you
some good, I'll give you a bed.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.264
Whatever you need.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.431
That's right!

34:27.433 --> 34:29.900
And we could live
our lives, friend.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.536
Truly live.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.438
There is definitely a
sense of togetherness,

34:34.440 --> 34:38.208
but I do wonder if this isolation
is the only way to achieve that.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.577
Well, I had hoped not,

34:39.578 --> 34:44.047
but I believe for the
time being that's so.

34:44.049 --> 34:48.453
You see, we built this
congregation over many years.

34:48.454 --> 34:52.556
We travel around and preach a
good word, wherever we went.

34:52.558 --> 34:55.460
And every stop we
made we'd pick up one

34:55.460 --> 34:58.096
or two of God's lost children.

34:58.097 --> 35:00.098
You know what we found
more often than not?

35:00.099 --> 35:02.600
It's a struggle to
bring people together.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.370
America is coming
apart at the seams

35:06.371 --> 35:11.709
because of the way it's being
run, and the values it instills.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.611
Your government is failing, friend.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.481
Now before you call me a
communist or socialist

35:16.482 --> 35:18.116
or whatever word you use

35:18.117 --> 35:20.985
for somebody who tries
to help this fellow men,

35:20.986 --> 35:24.322
let me remind you of one thing,

35:24.323 --> 35:27.125
all the great leaders who
have tried to achieve

35:27.126 --> 35:30.995
what we have here were
struck down and killed.

35:30.996 --> 35:32.330
That's right.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.632
Malcolm X.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.767
Martin Luther King.
Oh, my God.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.270
J.F.K.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.272
R.F.K.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.508
Well, I'm willing to die
for what I believe in,

35:43.509 --> 35:51.181
when you can remove yourself from the fight
altogether and create something new.

35:51.916 --> 35:55.019
A place without violence.

35:55.020 --> 35:58.256
Romans Chapter 12 verse 2.

35:58.257 --> 36:02.660
"Do not conform any longer to
the pattern of this world,

36:02.661 --> 36:08.898
but be transformed by the
renewing of your mind."

36:11.002 --> 36:15.071
And that way you can test
and prove God's will.

36:15.873 --> 36:20.511
God's good and pleasing
and perfect will.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.446
That's what we do here, see?

36:22.447 --> 36:26.784
We are continuing our
cause peacefully.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.686
Surely you can appreciate that.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.521
Absolutely.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.691
Speaking to that point,
when we came in,

36:33.692 --> 36:36.060
we noticed there were
a few men with guns.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.895
If this is a pacifist community,

36:37.896 --> 36:42.033
and it seems as if
it is, why the guns?

36:42.034 --> 36:45.168
Is there some paranoia
about the outside world?

36:45.970 --> 36:47.838
Today a woman even
called us outsiders.

36:47.839 --> 36:48.973
Oh.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.676
You see, this is why I
don't like the media.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.314
We have been speaking five minutes

36:56.315 --> 36:59.817
and you're already looking for
some negative angle to explore.

36:59.818 --> 37:03.321
Oh, no, I don't blame you, Sam.
It's not your fault.

37:03.322 --> 37:04.989
You don't even know
you're doing it.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.058
It's just the way you've
been conditioned.

37:07.059 --> 37:10.595
Come in here from a
sick, violent society,

37:10.596 --> 37:13.064
it's only natural that
you'd be less interested

37:13.065 --> 37:17.735
in the beauty of our community than in
the guns we use to protect the borders.

37:17.736 --> 37:18.736
I wasn't saying...

37:18.737 --> 37:21.739
What we're doing here is radical,
Sam, there's no doubt about it.

37:21.740 --> 37:26.010
And it is complicated, that's why
I want to explain it to you.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.246
I have sympathy for
your misunderstanding.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.747
We all do.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.714
We all used to think just like you.

37:32.883 --> 37:36.887
Let me just say that there are
certain government agencies

37:36.888 --> 37:41.024
that have been watching me and
my congregation for many years,

37:41.892 --> 37:43.394
everybody knows that.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.763
I do not keep it secret.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.099
But I made a promise
to these people

37:48.100 --> 37:52.136
that I would lead them
to a better existence

37:52.137 --> 37:54.237
and that includes protecting them.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.043
It's our home down here,
we have to preserve it.

37:59.044 --> 38:00.411
That's understandable.

38:00.412 --> 38:03.146
Yeah, see?
I knew he'd catch on.

38:03.981 --> 38:08.786
Living in that beehive New York
City has jaded you completely.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.154
That's good.

38:10.155 --> 38:12.188
So...

38:13.291 --> 38:16.794
It must have cost quite a bit
of money to create all this.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.298
Was it just through donations all
these people's life savings?

38:20.299 --> 38:21.932
Oh, Sam.

38:21.933 --> 38:25.569
I hate you, you
phrase it like that.

38:25.570 --> 38:28.139
Is that what money means to you?

38:28.140 --> 38:29.273
A life?

38:29.274 --> 38:32.443
We don't worship capitalism
and materialism.

38:32.444 --> 38:35.179
We came down here to
live off the land.

38:35.180 --> 38:38.916
That's why America started,
but they don't allow it anymore.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.452
Yeah, if you're not paying
taxes then you go to jail.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.788
Exactly.
That is exactly right.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.856
Now, Sam, let me ask you
a question if I may.

38:47.925 --> 38:50.961
Look around here,
look at all these people.

38:50.962 --> 38:55.965
Do you see anybody who looks
like they ought to go to jail?

39:00.037 --> 39:01.471
It doesn't look like it, no.

39:02.606 --> 39:05.209
That's right.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.044
I see you wear a
ring on your finger.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.680
You are married man, are you?

39:09.681 --> 39:10.715
Yes.

39:10.716 --> 39:11.982
Oh, that's good.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.883
You love your wife?

39:14.985 --> 39:16.120
Excuse me?

39:16.121 --> 39:19.222
A simple question.
Do you love your wife?

39:20.191 --> 39:21.859
Yes, of course.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.961
And you'd do anything for her.

39:23.962 --> 39:28.264
And what about that child
you have on the way?

39:29.700 --> 39:31.235
Oh, what's wrong?

39:31.236 --> 39:34.872
You seem caught off
guard by my question.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.840
Interesting when the shoe is
on the other foot, isn't it?

39:39.977 --> 39:43.481
And I suppose you were wondering how I
knew that about your wife, aren't you?

39:43.482 --> 39:46.217
Oh, relax, Sam.
I'm just making a point here.

39:46.218 --> 39:49.220
You see, I love these people here

39:49.221 --> 39:53.491
just as much as you love your
wife and your unborn child.

39:53.492 --> 39:58.329
These people,
my family, my children.

39:58.330 --> 40:00.431
And when you write this
up for your readers,

40:00.432 --> 40:04.001
I want you to remember that.

40:04.002 --> 40:07.505
And when you start to
put that spin on it,

40:07.506 --> 40:11.375
just know that you're
dealing with their lives,

40:11.376 --> 40:15.212
with those faces.

40:15.213 --> 40:18.949
Look at the joy on those faces.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.985
Remember what you're
seeing tonight, Sam.

40:24.021 --> 40:26.223
You have a great responsibility.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.157
I hope you're aware.

40:31.028 --> 40:32.897
I am.

40:32.898 --> 40:35.032
But we don't spin things.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.867
We try to be honestly subjective.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.602
We don't have an agenda,

40:38.603 --> 40:40.905
we're just trying to document
things that are meaningful.

40:40.906 --> 40:44.742
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Caroline told me that.

40:44.743 --> 40:47.411
That's why I agreed
to this interview.

40:47.412 --> 40:50.381
You know, I don't
believe in the media.

40:50.382 --> 40:55.419
I see it always lies
upon lies upon lies.

40:55.420 --> 40:58.187
Anything that'll sell more copies.

41:00.791 --> 41:04.060
But I look at you, Sam, and I
can tell you're different.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.830
I can see that you care.

41:10.167 --> 41:11.802
We try.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.537
Yes, you do.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.443
Well, are there anymore questions

41:19.444 --> 41:23.781
or can we quit all this and get on
to the celebration we got planned?

41:23.782 --> 41:25.182
We got a wonderful band.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.450
I know you're gonna love him.

41:32.857 --> 41:33.958
I guess we're fine.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.025
All right.

42:22.740 --> 42:28.644
Yo, so that was one of the strangest
interviews I've ever done.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.882
Shit. man.

42:31.883 --> 42:35.886
Yeah, if you could see, I only...

42:35.887 --> 42:37.988
Yeah, I only got through
about a quarter

42:37.989 --> 42:40.658
of my questions and
really I'm not sure

42:40.659 --> 42:43.727
if any of those even got answered.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.029
Everything just sort
of got swept up

42:45.030 --> 42:50.267
in this weird energy and I
couldn't think straight.

42:50.268 --> 42:53.270
He had a way about him.

42:53.271 --> 42:55.906
That's hard to focus.

42:55.907 --> 42:58.909
Well, the thing about my
wife really stunned me.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.545
And you were saying that
he must have heard it

43:01.546 --> 43:03.914
from one of the people we
talked to, which makes sense,

43:03.915 --> 43:08.552
but man, fuck me, it was
all just so jarring.

43:08.553 --> 43:11.422
All that clapping.

43:11.423 --> 43:14.425
I hope it wasn't worthless.

43:14.426 --> 43:19.263
See, they're setting up for a party

43:19.264 --> 43:21.765
and hopefully we can get
some better footage

43:21.766 --> 43:24.435
to make up for me dropping
the ball like that.

43:24.436 --> 43:25.802
Sorry, man.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.942
There's a ton of good stuff, man, I
don't think you should worry about it.

43:31.943 --> 43:36.712
With Patrick...

45:01.398 --> 45:04.802
Okay, I've completely turned
the corner on this place.

45:04.803 --> 45:07.037
I'm a fan of this goat.

45:07.038 --> 45:09.173
And people seemed really psyched,

45:09.174 --> 45:12.676
party was great even
without any booze.

45:12.677 --> 45:15.012
I'm starting to be able to see why
people want to live like this.

45:15.013 --> 45:19.917
I mean, I wouldn't, but I think
I'm starting to better understand

45:19.918 --> 45:21.552
where they're coming from.

45:21.553 --> 45:23.887
I dig it.

45:23.888 --> 45:26.156
Music's actually really good.

45:26.157 --> 45:28.559
And I fucking hate church music.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.928
Yeah, he wasn't lying about that.

45:30.929 --> 45:34.531
Patrick's having a good
time wherever he is.

45:34.532 --> 45:37.768
He might not want to
come back with us.

45:37.769 --> 45:39.168
Oh, heads up.

45:40.938 --> 45:42.338
Hey, Savannah.

45:45.442 --> 45:46.943
You're having a good time?

45:50.280 --> 45:51.681
What?
Is this for me?

45:53.183 --> 45:55.085
Thank you.

45:55.086 --> 45:56.619
- What is it?
- I don't know.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.963
What is it?

46:05.964 --> 46:07.229
What's it say?

46:15.105 --> 46:16.973
Oh, shit.

46:44.835 --> 46:49.939
<i>♪ Fix me, Jesus, fix me ♪</i>

46:50.908 --> 46:52.342
Where is she?

46:52.343 --> 46:53.777
I don't know.

46:53.778 --> 46:58.047
<i>♪ Oh, fix me ♪</i>

47:00.150 --> 47:05.921
<i>♪ Oh, fix me ♪</i>

47:07.858 --> 47:14.130
<i>♪ Oh, fix me ♪</i>

47:15.766 --> 47:21.804
<i>♪ Fix me, Jesus, fix me ♪</i>

47:33.317 --> 47:36.687
And there's the guards.

47:36.688 --> 47:39.056
What are they doing with guns?

47:39.057 --> 47:41.325
I don't like this.

47:41.326 --> 47:43.159
We got to find Patrick.

47:51.668 --> 47:54.404
Patrick?

47:54.405 --> 47:55.971
He's not in here.

47:58.842 --> 48:00.609
Fuck.

48:03.213 --> 48:05.448
What is all this shit?

48:08.585 --> 48:09.586
Let's get out of here.

48:09.587 --> 48:12.489
Sam, hold on.
Safe's open.

48:12.490 --> 48:15.225
Oh, dude, you've got
to get over here.

48:15.226 --> 48:16.493
Leave it, man.

48:16.494 --> 48:17.728
Holy shit.

48:17.729 --> 48:18.729
It's all their passports.

48:18.730 --> 48:20.197
Dude, I don't give a shit.
Let's go.

48:20.198 --> 48:21.732
I got to get some shots of you
looking through this shit.

48:21.733 --> 48:23.500
Somebody's coming, Jake, come on.

48:23.501 --> 48:25.601
Come on.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.006
Can I help you guys?

48:29.007 --> 48:31.006
Yeah, we were just looking
for your brother.

48:33.844 --> 48:36.879
His room's just right
around the corner.

48:50.394 --> 48:52.462
Oh, he is not here right now.

48:52.463 --> 48:53.463
Huh?

48:53.464 --> 48:56.033
I completely forgot.
He is busy.

48:56.034 --> 48:57.534
Busy doing what?

48:57.535 --> 49:00.637
I've been telling Allison
and Sarah about him

49:00.638 --> 49:04.141
And they're just so happy
that he's finally here.

49:04.142 --> 49:07.110
So they took him.

49:07.111 --> 49:09.379
Threesomes aren't
particularly Christian,

49:09.380 --> 49:12.149
if I'm remembering
Sunday school correctly.

49:12.150 --> 49:14.151
Well, we all have to sin
every once in a while

49:14.152 --> 49:15.986
as long as Father approves.

49:15.987 --> 49:18.255
He approved getting
your brother laid?

49:18.256 --> 49:20.924
One must not question
what's best for the Parish.

49:20.925 --> 49:22.793
How so?

49:22.794 --> 49:26.396
I love my brother and
I miss him so much.

49:26.397 --> 49:29.066
And I think that he
would be so happy here

49:29.067 --> 49:31.568
and we're just trying
to show him that.

49:31.569 --> 49:35.005
Don't you think he'd
miss New York, his job?

49:35.006 --> 49:36.807
He can be a photographer here.

49:36.808 --> 49:39.810
And he has all these ideas...
This idea about this book

49:39.811 --> 49:41.812
about the Parish, I
think it's brilliant.

49:41.813 --> 49:43.580
And my parents can support him

49:43.581 --> 49:45.916
and we're expanding all
this and we need money.

49:45.917 --> 49:48.685
And if Patrick stays then
we can get the money and...

49:48.686 --> 49:51.088
Yeah, you want your parents
to send money to help

49:51.089 --> 49:52.422
build this place out.

49:52.423 --> 49:55.158
It's a donation.
It's the same as you.

49:55.159 --> 49:58.095
It's... We just need to get
through this next phase

49:58.096 --> 49:59.930
and then we'll be completely fine.

49:59.931 --> 50:01.331
Oh, are you all right?

50:01.332 --> 50:03.533
Yeah. Yeah.

50:03.534 --> 50:06.470
Caroline, I need your assistance.

50:06.471 --> 50:09.071
I'm coming, Father.

50:11.608 --> 50:14.611
If you see Patrick, tell
him to come see us.

50:14.612 --> 50:15.679
Okay.

50:15.680 --> 50:19.216
Just relax.
You're in paradise.

50:19.217 --> 50:21.685
You fellows seem lost.

50:21.686 --> 50:24.354
Do you need someone to walk
you back to your cottage?

50:24.355 --> 50:26.356
No.
We're fine.

50:26.357 --> 50:27.624
You sure about that?

50:27.625 --> 50:30.460
You wouldn't want to walk
into the wrong place.

50:30.461 --> 50:31.628
Why?

50:31.629 --> 50:35.132
Is there something you
don't want us to see?

50:35.133 --> 50:39.870
It's just an expression, friend.

50:39.871 --> 50:43.974
It's late, you want to go poking
around other people's business,

50:43.975 --> 50:46.009
you go right on ahead.

50:46.010 --> 50:48.712
But if you put your hand
into the dog's bone,

50:48.713 --> 50:51.848
don't be surprised if you get bit.

50:51.849 --> 50:54.384
What's that supposed to mean?

50:54.385 --> 50:56.753
You boys have a nice evening.

50:56.754 --> 51:00.155
Sam, let's just drop it.

51:04.361 --> 51:06.362
Patrick?
Sam, come on.

51:11.034 --> 51:12.801
Shit.

51:15.739 --> 51:17.174
What the fuck is going on here?

51:17.175 --> 51:18.508
Did he just threaten us?

51:18.509 --> 51:20.277
I'm not sure.

51:20.278 --> 51:22.612
Do you think he knows
we were in the office?

51:22.613 --> 51:25.115
Anyway, is Patrick's
sister hiding his files?

51:25.116 --> 51:27.918
I know she is not supposed to be.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.920
They're just using Patrick?

51:29.921 --> 51:31.021
I don't know.

51:31.022 --> 51:33.455
I don't know what's
going on anymore.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.929
This is too fucked up.

51:38.930 --> 51:40.430
These people are happy living here.

51:40.431 --> 51:42.432
Good for them, but I don't
want to get any more involved.

51:42.433 --> 51:44.901
I'm done.

51:44.902 --> 51:47.437
Also, if she's getting high
and sleeping with the guy,

51:47.438 --> 51:48.905
what's the point of this place?

51:48.906 --> 51:52.309
It's supposed to be
sober living, right?

51:52.310 --> 51:54.711
I mean, she looks an awful lot
like the fucked up sister

51:54.712 --> 51:57.079
Patrick was describing.

52:23.240 --> 52:27.310
Savannah?
Where is she, dude?

52:27.311 --> 52:28.478
Where did she go?

52:28.479 --> 52:30.612
I don't know.

52:51.835 --> 52:54.604
Please, take us with you.

52:54.605 --> 52:55.872
What?

52:55.873 --> 52:57.507
You don't know what's
really going on here.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.643
They will kill us if they
know we were talking to you.

52:59.644 --> 53:00.777
Who?

53:00.778 --> 53:01.878
Father.

53:01.879 --> 53:03.880
This place is not
what it seems like.

53:03.881 --> 53:06.016
They hurt people who
go against the Parish.

53:06.017 --> 53:07.851
Please, you have to help us.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.286
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?

53:09.287 --> 53:11.655
They keep it secret,
but it happens.

53:11.656 --> 53:13.523
Father will not let us leave.
We're prisoners here.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.792
You are being manipulated.

53:15.793 --> 53:18.895
We talked with plenty other
people, they all seemed happy.

53:18.896 --> 53:20.030
No.

53:20.031 --> 53:22.899
You talked with who Father
wanted you to talk with.

53:22.900 --> 53:26.903
Many other people won't tell you
but they are afraid to speak out.

53:26.904 --> 53:29.539
You don't understand the hold
he has over a lot of them,

53:29.540 --> 53:32.409
they're brainwashed and don't even
know it, they'll do anything he asks.

53:32.410 --> 53:34.511
Your friend's sister
is one of them.

53:34.512 --> 53:36.913
She has done terrible things
to people who act tough.

53:36.914 --> 53:39.049
Savannah saw them.

53:39.050 --> 53:43.019
They beat my daughter, that's
why she won't speak anymore.

53:43.020 --> 53:45.422
Please, please, help us.

53:45.423 --> 53:47.390
I don't know what we can do.

53:47.391 --> 53:48.825
Our helicopter comes
in the morning,

53:48.826 --> 53:50.827
but it's not big enough to
carry many more people out.

53:50.828 --> 53:51.928
Then just take my daughter.

53:51.929 --> 53:52.929
What?

53:52.930 --> 53:55.065
Please, don't let her die.
I beg you.

53:55.066 --> 53:57.334
Shh! Ssh!
Somebody is coming.

53:57.335 --> 53:58.934
Oh, God.

54:00.537 --> 54:03.038
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

54:04.574 --> 54:06.209
What is going on here?

54:06.210 --> 54:07.544
We found her wandering out here.

54:07.545 --> 54:10.347
We're trying to find out where she lives.
She doesn't talk much.

54:10.348 --> 54:11.348
I will take her.

54:11.349 --> 54:12.349
Oh, it's okay.
We can do it.

54:12.350 --> 54:15.217
I know where she lives.
I will take her.

54:17.687 --> 54:20.557
Where is your mother, Savannah?

54:20.558 --> 54:23.693
I will go tell Father.

54:23.694 --> 54:25.227
Let's go.

54:32.369 --> 54:35.872
Jesus Christ.

54:35.873 --> 54:37.874
Come on.

54:37.875 --> 54:39.741
Let's just get back inside.

54:41.444 --> 54:44.314
They were terrified.

54:44.315 --> 54:46.983
We shouldn't have let him take her.
Why the fuck did we let them take her?

54:46.984 --> 54:49.085
What were we supposed to do?

54:49.086 --> 54:51.121
We can't take anyone with us.

54:51.122 --> 54:52.756
We could've done something.

54:52.757 --> 54:54.124
Sam, it's not why we're here.

54:54.125 --> 54:56.593
It's not our problem.

54:56.594 --> 55:00.230
It's not why we make these films,
you're losing sight of things.

55:00.231 --> 55:03.333
We can report this when we get back,
but it's not up to us to decide

55:03.334 --> 55:04.901
what happens to these people.

55:04.902 --> 55:07.270
We're not the Red Cross.

55:07.271 --> 55:08.838
Did you see those scars?

55:08.839 --> 55:12.108
How could she let her
daughter be beaten like that?

55:12.109 --> 55:13.643
<i>That's all for tonight.</i>

55:13.644 --> 55:16.146
<i>It's been wonderful.</i>

55:16.147 --> 55:19.282
<i>Return to your cottages and
be thankful for the joy</i>

55:19.283 --> 55:22.018
<i>we have in our lives.</i>

55:22.019 --> 55:23.787
<i>Will Wendy and the clean up crew</i>

55:23.788 --> 55:27.624
<i>please meet me at the
pavilion in 15 minutes?</i>

55:27.625 --> 55:30.025
<i>God bless you all.</i>

55:32.429 --> 55:35.031
Look at them just do exactly
what he tells them.

55:35.032 --> 55:37.199
Brainwashed.

55:41.938 --> 55:45.675
Look, the helicopter is gonna
be back here in 8 hours.

55:45.676 --> 55:49.145
Let's just pack our bags
and be ready to go,

55:49.146 --> 55:52.015
seems like everybody
is going to sleep.

55:52.016 --> 55:53.516
I don't think anything else
is gonna happen tonight.

55:53.517 --> 55:56.386
You know, let's just
try and get some rest

55:56.387 --> 55:58.955
and hopefully things
will calm down.

55:58.956 --> 56:02.692
But when the sun comes up,
we're gonna get Patrick,

56:02.693 --> 56:05.328
we're getting the hell out of here.

56:05.329 --> 56:07.296
What is this place?

56:45.735 --> 56:47.937
Well, it's officially 5 o'clock.

56:47.938 --> 56:51.107
So much for the greatest
night's sleep of our lives.

56:51.108 --> 56:53.576
Tried to go to sleep
about an hour ago.

56:53.577 --> 56:55.378
Whatever they're doing
in the pavilion

56:55.379 --> 56:59.215
seems to have stopped,
so it's been quiet.

56:59.216 --> 57:00.717
Oh.

57:00.718 --> 57:02.252
Neither of us could sleep.

57:02.253 --> 57:04.387
It's a weird night.

57:04.388 --> 57:09.759
Looks like it's finally
getting to us.

57:09.760 --> 57:14.764
Well, I'm actually really scared.

57:14.765 --> 57:19.969
It's the most scared I've
been in a long time.

57:19.970 --> 57:23.005
Ready to go home.

57:42.492 --> 57:45.161
All right, it's morning now.

57:45.162 --> 57:48.064
We made it through the night.

57:48.065 --> 57:52.001
There appears to be some kind
of group of people gathered

57:52.002 --> 57:54.170
outside of the pavilion.

57:54.171 --> 57:56.639
It's unclear what exactly
is going on over there,

57:56.640 --> 57:59.175
but we're gonna have to
just go find Patrick

57:59.176 --> 58:04.346
and start to make our way
back to the air strip.

58:16.826 --> 58:20.295
You see this?

58:23.333 --> 58:25.168
Jesus Christ.

58:25.169 --> 58:28.103
What the hell is going on?

58:42.986 --> 58:45.321
Hey, what the fuck is happening?

58:45.322 --> 58:46.489
Dude, what's going on?

58:46.490 --> 58:47.690
This has been happening
for an hour.

58:47.691 --> 58:51.461
These people want to leave, I started
filming 'cause I knew you'd want it.

58:51.462 --> 58:52.695
I have no idea what to do.

58:52.696 --> 58:53.997
All these people want to leave?

58:53.998 --> 58:57.066
They all know we have a helicopter
coming and they want on it.

58:57.067 --> 58:59.135
We can't take all
these people with us.

58:59.136 --> 59:01.137
I told them, I keep telling
them, they won't listen.

59:01.138 --> 59:02.205
Caroline has been
freaking out all morning.

59:02.206 --> 59:03.505
I don't know what to do.

59:06.242 --> 59:07.343
Hi.

59:07.344 --> 59:08.878
Is everything all right?
Yeah, it's fine.

59:08.879 --> 59:12.248
We haven't had anyone
come here for over a year

59:12.249 --> 59:14.384
and so you guys being here is
really stressing them out.

59:14.385 --> 59:16.386
Okay, can I... Can
I ask you on the record

59:16.387 --> 59:19.756
Okay, you know just really
don't concern yourselves.

59:19.757 --> 59:22.091
It's fine.
Everything... This is nothing.

59:22.092 --> 59:23.893
Caroline, this is not nothing.
These people want to leave.

59:23.894 --> 59:25.495
You can't keep them here.

59:25.496 --> 59:27.363
Listen, you guys...
They can't leave.

59:27.364 --> 59:29.766
They have to stay here.
Their families are here.

59:29.767 --> 59:31.534
Do you want to break
up their families?

59:31.535 --> 59:34.270
Hey, wait a minute.
They are allowed to leave, right?

59:34.271 --> 59:36.406
Of course, they are.
That's not what I'm saying.

59:36.407 --> 59:38.908
You guys need to go to the
helicopter right now.

59:38.909 --> 59:42.111
Hey, Sam!
Sam!

59:42.112 --> 59:44.514
Sam, do not get involved in this.

59:44.515 --> 59:46.416
What are you doing?
Come on.

59:46.417 --> 59:47.784
Please, take her with you.

59:47.785 --> 59:49.919
Calm down, Wendy. No one
is taking her anywhere!

59:49.920 --> 59:51.921
I told you, our
helicopter is too small.

59:51.922 --> 59:53.423
You could take just her.

59:53.424 --> 59:55.258
Dude, no.

59:55.259 --> 59:57.560
Go ahead and get to the field,
ask how many people it can hold,

59:57.561 --> 59:58.928
I'll stay back here
and figure this out.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.129
Sam, this is crazy.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.564
- We can't take anybody with us.

01:00:01.565 --> 01:00:02.565
-Just her.

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:03.967
I can't leave her like this, man.

01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:06.569
Just get there before the pilot leaves.
Have one of the guys radio back.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:08.805
That'll work, right?

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:11.207
Just don't let that
helicopter leave without us.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:14.310
Go, hurry.

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:16.578
Caroline, where's the ride?

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:21.918
All right.

01:00:21.919 --> 01:00:24.454
I'll radio back soon as
I know what we can do.

01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:26.089
You're sure you know,
when we come back

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:28.223
Trust in your brother...

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.232
It's gonna be okay.
It's fine.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:37.834
We're not gonna leave
without you, okay?

01:00:37.835 --> 01:00:38.968
You cannot do this.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.470
Back off!

01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:43.338
We're not gonna leave
you, I promise.

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:47.477
What happened?
Where is Jake?

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:50.113
We need to figure this out.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:53.349
Caroline, where are you going?
I have to get Father!

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.952
He warned me about this,
he was right about you,

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:57.353
he was right about all of you.

01:00:57.354 --> 01:00:59.355
You came here to destroy
us from within.

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:01.991
I didn't want to believe it, I
fought for you to come here.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:04.494
You are not my family,
I made a big mistake.

01:01:04.495 --> 01:01:07.128
Stop fucking filming me.

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.384
Hey!

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:30.385
Hey!

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:34.222
Hey.

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:36.225
Where are the others?

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:38.728
They're coming, they're coming.
How many more people can fit in this?

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.663
No, that was not the deal.
No one else comes.

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:43.332
No, it's just... It's a mom and her
daughter and my friend's sister.

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:44.333
No, I told you.

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:45.368
No, she's sick.
We have to help her.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.136
Only the ones I bring
in, no exceptions.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.304
Look, I don't understand, man...

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:21.537
You're scaring the little
one, you're scaring her.

01:02:21.538 --> 01:02:24.340
Hey, Sam, look out.

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:25.707
Hey...

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.190
Take the camera.

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:43.593
I want you to film this.

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:44.727
It's an order.

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:46.528
Yes, Father.

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.419
Do you see him?

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.756
Where's he?

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:49.758
He's gone.

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:06.441
I think I see him.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.289
He's gone.

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.058
What are we doing?

01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:23.392
Why are we chasing him?

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:24.961
It was Father's orders.

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:26.796
This is the end he talked about.

01:04:26.797 --> 01:04:30.231
Nobody can leave here alive.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:42.979
<i>Hurry up, children,</i>

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.915
<i>please hurry.</i>

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:49.418
<i>I need you all to hear
what I have to say.</i>

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:52.488
<i>Every family, every one of them,</i>

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:55.491
<i>come on, we don't have much time.</i>

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:59.829
<i>You must be here.</i>
<i>This concerns all of you.</i>

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:02.231
<i>I need you here with me now,</i>

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:06.367
<i>quickly, quickly, quickly.</i>

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:21.017
Come on in.

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:22.618
Everybody, come in here.

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:26.222
Have a seat, please be seated.

01:05:26.223 --> 01:05:29.657
Everyone be seated
please, have a seat.

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:38.533
I've got something to
tell you, so settle down.

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:41.871
You know I love you.

01:05:41.872 --> 01:05:44.774
Yes, Father.

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:48.644
I gave you all I had.

01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:54.050
But there comes a day when
the quality of your life

01:05:54.051 --> 01:06:00.556
matters more than the time
you've got left to live.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:03.659
Oh, the men came here

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:10.066
and destroyed everything
we worked for.

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:12.168
We can't let them go
back to New York.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:13.169
No.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.437
No.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:19.775
Because they would spread lies
about us and what we have here.

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:21.410
Yes, Father.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:25.147
Then their government
would send soldiers here

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:29.785
to burn our homes and take our
children and kill us all!

01:06:29.786 --> 01:06:31.320
No, no.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:34.590
That's right, we can't
let that happen, no!

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:36.826
I will not let that happen.

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:39.462
Now I didn't want
to hurt these men,

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:43.165
but somebody will come looking
for them, you know they will.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:44.333
Yes, Father.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.302
So where do they go?

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:49.972
Or where do they stay?

01:06:49.973 --> 01:06:53.342
This is the end for us.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:59.615
Our time has finally come.

01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:02.118
Oh.

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:08.357
Oh, mother, precious mother,

01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:13.829
I'll come with you, Father.
Take me with you.

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:19.001
I know you will.

01:07:19.002 --> 01:07:23.005
Some of you have been with
me since the beginning.

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:25.741
We knew this day might come.

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:32.515
We talked about it and
we planned for it.

01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:36.018
Some of the children have
already been given the potion.

01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:38.888
Oh, no.

01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:41.891
We don't wait to be murdered.

01:07:41.892 --> 01:07:44.160
We don't wait to be
struck down like dogs.

01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:48.097
Take your drink and lay down
your life with your family.

01:07:48.098 --> 01:07:50.366
If we can't live our life this way,

01:07:50.367 --> 01:07:54.403
what earthly life is worth living?

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:57.406
This is the last
sacrament, children.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:08:00.676
They all know we're
not afraid to die,

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:05.181
but I want us to be able
to choose our own death.

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:10.252
We can go kindly and
we can go quiet.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.622
This is our final test.

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:14.790
Oh, I love you all.

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:18.694
You've been so loyal
to me all these years

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:22.198
and we're gonna be together again.

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:26.834
We are heading for eternal life.

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.604
Where are they?

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:37.106
They're gone.

01:09:37.107 --> 01:09:39.642
Please, I could still
fly us out of here.

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:42.743
Please help me, help me to my seat.

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.218
Get your friends.
Hurry.

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:53.054
We don't have much time.
Go, go.

01:09:56.525 --> 01:10:01.664
Don't struggle, no, don't struggle
with it, don't you struggle.

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:05.668
It's a bitter taste
and then it's over.

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:11.040
There's no pain,
there's no convulsions

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:14.176
and this is not suicide.

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:18.647
We are not sinners, no, we're
proving our faith here.

01:10:18.648 --> 01:10:22.184
Let's offer our bodies
as a living sacrifice,

01:10:22.185 --> 01:10:27.189
holy and pleasing to
the Lord, Romans 12:1.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:32.161
We can't go back, there's
nowhere to go back to.

01:10:32.162 --> 01:10:35.564
So our time is up.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.199
Don't be afraid.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.334
Don't be afraid.

01:10:38.335 --> 01:10:42.037
It's just stepping over
to the other side.

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:44.773
That's all it is.

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:49.278
Let's show the world that
the only peace left for us

01:10:49.279 --> 01:10:52.414
is in death.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:55.918
We are going to a better place now.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:58.220
Let's all go together.

01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:02.725
It's just a little medication,
that's all it is.

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:05.794
We're just going to sleep.

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:08.597
Everybody, get a drink now
just like we rehearsed.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:14.236
Father, no, no, look, I'm sorry but
this just don't make no sense.

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:17.373
I mean, we all worked hard here,

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:19.208
how are we just gonna
give up like this?

01:11:19.209 --> 01:11:21.944
Oh, son, we're not giving up.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:28.083
I've never lied to you and I tell
you now they will come down here

01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:32.755
with their guns and
bombs and wipe us out.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:35.958
America's on the brink
of another war.

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:38.894
We don't deserve to die like that,

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:41.897
we deserve peace.

01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:45.634
You all agree with that,
that's why you came down here.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:48.236
Father.

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:57.413
We have to go, so
let's go together.

01:11:57.414 --> 01:11:59.148
Out time is up.

01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:02.251
Come on in, bring them in.

01:12:02.252 --> 01:12:04.286
That's right, that's right.

01:12:04.287 --> 01:12:08.023
Keep your dignity, son.
We're all here with you.

01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:12.528
That's right, that's right,
quickly, quickly.

01:12:12.529 --> 01:12:18.167
Mothers, help your children, tell
them everything is all right.

01:12:18.168 --> 01:12:21.370
Go ahead and drink if you
got a drink, drink it up.

01:12:21.371 --> 01:12:26.308
I tried to create a heaven
here, you know, I tried.

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:28.944
But now the time has come.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:33.515
Step over to the other side
with our brothers and sisters,

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:37.686
where the real heaven waits.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:44.560
Come over here, take
more of this, take more.

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:48.831
We all must take our drink.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:59.041
Take it.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:02.077
Take it.

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:04.345
Take it.

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:08.317
Take it.

01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:10.084
Take it.

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:12.119
Take it.

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:14.188
Take it.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.657
Take it.

01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:04.273
Anybody who receives this,
something terrible happened here.

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:07.276
I don't know why, but
they're trying to kill us.

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:09.411
I'm just gonna keep rolling

01:14:09.412 --> 01:14:11.780
and I hope that I get
as much as possible,

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:16.017
hope that this footage
makes it out of here.

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:24.158
Whatever happens, this
story needs to be told.

01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:32.566
No, no.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.335
Come on.

01:15:06.336 --> 01:15:08.804
- Drink this.
- No.

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:10.706
It's okay...

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:12.975
It's great, it's painless...

01:15:12.976 --> 01:15:14.343
No, no!

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:15.811
Patrick, Patrick!

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:20.314
It can go this way,
it's so much easier.

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:24.853
Come on, you silly,
come on, Caroline.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:27.122
Where's the key?

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:30.359
You need to find the key.
No, no.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.627
What is that?

01:15:31.628 --> 01:15:33.195
What is that?

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.997
What is that?

01:15:34.998 --> 01:15:36.832
- What did you just do?
- It's okay.

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:38.000
- What did you just do?
- Okay.

01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:40.636
What did you just put in me?
What did you put in me?

01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:45.474
Caroline, no, no, no, what is that?

01:15:45.475 --> 01:15:47.976
Don't leave me, don't leave me.
You know I love you, I love you.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:51.079
We got to find Jake,
I love you, I love you.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:54.516
Caroline, no, we can still
go, we can still leave,

01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:58.020
We can still go home,
think about mom and dad.

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:01.523
Think about mom and dad.

01:16:01.524 --> 01:16:03.759
No, no, what is that?

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.394
What did you put in me?

01:16:05.395 --> 01:16:06.662
What is that, Caroline?

01:16:06.663 --> 01:16:09.097
What did you put in me?

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:13.669
No, no, let's get out of here.

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:15.671
What is that?

01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:16.937
Shh!

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:20.008
Shh!

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:22.544
We're gonna die.
I don't want to die.

01:16:22.545 --> 01:16:28.784
I don't want to die. Oh, my God.

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:32.688
Oh, my God.

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:35.257
Caroline.

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:44.398
Shh!

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:52.072
Shh.

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.251
<i>Calm down,</i>

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:38.954
<i>everyone, calm down.</i>

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:41.189
<i>The potion works</i>

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.749
No, no.

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:19.795
<i>Don't let your families be
murdered by these terrorists.</i>

01:18:19.796 --> 01:18:23.632
<i>This is the only remaining
way for us to go.</i>

01:18:23.633 --> 01:18:25.133
<i>This is an active revolution.</i>

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:29.037
<i>We'd rather die than go
back to their way of life.</i>

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:31.640
<i>This world will see it
as just our sacrifice,</i>

01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:34.743
<i>but we won't let them
take our lives, no!</i>

01:18:34.744 --> 01:18:37.813
<i>We are laying down our lives.</i>

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:43.051
<i>So lie down.</i>
<i>Lie down, children.</i>

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:47.422
<i>Lie down and go to sleep.</i>

01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:50.025
<i>Just go to sleep.</i>

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:52.027
<i>Sleep.</i>

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:55.430
<i>Just go to sleep.</i>

01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:57.833
<i>Sleep.</i>

01:18:57.834 --> 01:19:00.167
<i>Sleep.</i>

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:13.734
Where is everyone?

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:25.479
Oh, my God.

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:29.616
What happened here?

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:08.522
Andre?

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:15.530
My mother, my brother,

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:19.267
my sister, they are gone.

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:23.038
Poisoned.

01:22:23.039 --> 01:22:24.773
Don't leave me.

01:22:24.774 --> 01:22:26.641
Shh.
Shh.

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:29.477
Are they going to heaven?

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:30.745
All right.

01:22:30.746 --> 01:22:34.648
Don't leave me.
Are we going to heaven?

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:39.988
Oh, my God.

01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:42.424
Fuck.

01:22:42.425 --> 01:22:44.559
Sam!

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.194
Sam?

01:23:03.913 --> 01:23:05.413
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:07.949
No, no, stop, it's
okay, it's just me.

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:09.651
We need to be quiet, please.

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.086
Don't be afraid.

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:12.654
Oh, shit, okay.

01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:15.323
They're coming, all right, come
on, quick, we got to hide.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:16.458
Come on, get down, get down.

01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:18.660
I'm not gonna let them
hurt you, I promise.

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:20.662
Sshhh, get down in there.

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:24.099
I'm not gonna let them
murder my daughter.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.701
Please, they'll hear you.

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:31.840
No, don't!
What are you doing?

01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:33.975
It's all right.

01:23:33.976 --> 01:23:36.443
It's okay, it's all right.

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:43.817
It's okay, it's all
right, it's all right.

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:11.912
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:09.036
Oh.

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:27.722
Caroline.

01:25:27.723 --> 01:25:32.359
Where did she go?

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:58.518
Caroline?

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.690
Caroline?
What are you doing?

01:26:02.691 --> 01:26:03.958
Patrick's dead.

01:26:03.959 --> 01:26:06.861
Everything that we worked so hard for,
it's all over now, I have to destroy.

01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:08.997
Caroline, stop, we can still leave.

01:26:08.998 --> 01:26:10.632
- And go where?
- Go home.

01:26:10.633 --> 01:26:12.200
This was my home!

01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:14.836
All these people they were
my family, they're all gone!

01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:17.205
Don't you understand?
I have nothing left!

01:26:17.206 --> 01:26:18.773
Where is Sam?

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:20.008
Father took him.

01:26:20.009 --> 01:26:21.776
Took him where?

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:23.611
Caroline, don't do this!

01:26:23.612 --> 01:26:25.380
You should have never come here.

01:26:25.381 --> 01:26:26.881
No!

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:43.397
Sam?

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:51.039
Jake?

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:56.544
Here we are, three of us.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:58.646
All that's left.

01:26:58.647 --> 01:27:03.818
We couldn't live this way anymore
but I couldn't let him go.

01:27:03.819 --> 01:27:09.057
That's right, that's right.

01:27:09.058 --> 01:27:14.562
I gave them all I could and
I gave them a way out.

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:18.266
We were doing something
great down here.

01:27:18.267 --> 01:27:23.336
We were gonna change the world,
this was only the beginning.

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:28.943
Why couldn't you leave us alone?

01:27:28.944 --> 01:27:31.845
What harm are we doing down here?

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.582
We didn't do any of this.

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:37.085
You brought violence on us.

01:27:37.086 --> 01:27:38.953
Are you proud of that?

01:27:38.954 --> 01:27:43.224
Do you take your responsibility
for those lives?

01:27:43.225 --> 01:27:47.228
If not then step on over
with the rest of us.

01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:48.596
No, just stop this.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:50.365
None of those people had to die.

01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:52.467
Everybody dies, friend,

01:27:52.468 --> 01:27:56.938
and greater love hath
no man than this,

01:27:56.939 --> 01:28:03.745
that he laid down his
life for his friends.

01:28:03.746 --> 01:28:07.081
That's how we used to
teach it to the children.

01:28:07.082 --> 01:28:11.119
That's John 15:13.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:14.222
Please.

01:28:14.223 --> 01:28:18.593
I'm gonna be a father,
I have a family.

01:28:18.594 --> 01:28:22.162
You don't have to do this.

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:28.970
You destroyed my family.

01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:36.744
One day, you'll understand,
you'll see it for what it is.

01:28:36.745 --> 01:28:38.913
I'm tired.

01:28:38.914 --> 01:28:44.118
I'm so tired.

01:28:44.119 --> 01:28:48.122
I gave it all I had.

01:28:48.123 --> 01:28:52.126
Now it's time to go.

01:28:52.127 --> 01:28:56.130
We have to show the
world we're not afraid.

01:28:56.131 --> 01:28:57.665
It's our time now.

01:28:57.666 --> 01:29:01.369
No, it's not our time,
we can still live.

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:05.873
Blessed is the man
who stands the test

01:29:05.874 --> 01:29:08.876
for he shall receive
the crown of life

01:29:08.877 --> 01:29:12.013
that God promised to
those who love him.

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:13.181
No, what are you doing?

01:29:13.182 --> 01:29:15.049
Jake, he's got a gun.

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:16.050
What?

01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:17.951
Hey, no.
No, no, no.

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:27.827
Get the key, it's in his pocket.

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:38.072
Okay.
Hold still.

01:29:38.073 --> 01:29:39.707
Hold still.

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:40.975
Okay, quick, get up.

01:29:40.976 --> 01:29:42.043
Get up, Sam.

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:44.978
Come on, the helicopter's waiting.
We got to go, come on.

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:49.917
Where is Patrick?

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:51.586
He is dead, everybody is dead.

01:29:51.587 --> 01:29:56.591
Come on, we got to go, we got to get out
of here before that pilot leaves, hurry.

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.993
Sam, get down.

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:06.734
Shh.

01:30:08.871 --> 01:30:11.205
Where is he?

01:30:11.206 --> 01:30:15.610
He's coming towards us.

01:30:15.611 --> 01:30:16.844
What do you want to do?

01:30:16.845 --> 01:30:19.113
I don't know.

01:30:21.016 --> 01:30:24.719
Oh, shit, he's inside the pavilion.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.887
Do you want to rush him?

01:30:25.888 --> 01:30:26.888
No.

01:30:26.889 --> 01:30:29.524
We can't, he's too far away.

01:30:42.638 --> 01:30:44.639
Get out of here.
Get up, go!

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.909
Let's go, come on, hurry.

01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:49.877
I'm burning this
place to the ground.

01:30:49.878 --> 01:30:51.811
Go!

01:30:52.305 --> 01:30:58.468
