WEBVTT

00:58.350 --> 01:01.228
To our Black community: We see you.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.147
We stand against racism.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.386
How is that?

01:35.721 --> 01:36.722
It's really intense.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.267
My book club's reading it.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.356
Wanda! Wanda.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.691
Hi. Blake.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.485
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:50.569 --> 01:53.363
It's so great
to finally meet you in person.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.449
It's been so fun
to respond to your emails.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.452
When you're chained to a desk,
you gotta find some joy, right?

01:58.535 --> 01:59.953
Yeah. How was your flight?

02:00.037 --> 02:01.413
It was good, yeah.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.498
Okay.

02:03.582 --> 02:06.210
-Can I blow up your spot? 'Cause homegirl…
-Oh, my God. Please don't.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.961
-She has the whole--
-I have not gotten used to this yet.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.757
Well, you better get used to it.
You're on every best seller.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.383
-Let me take the bag.
-I got it.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.427
No, please, honey. Come on.
You're the talent.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.722
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.682
Watch those boots.

02:20.766 --> 02:21.767
ASOS.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.270
Can I tell you something?

02:26.396 --> 02:28.565
I didn't know you were Black.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.069
Okay.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.489
Because of-- Yes, I know. I know.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.534
"Blake" gives off
some serious colonizer vibes.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.203
Okay, so here's the story.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.830
My first name is Ugandan.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.749
My mother was in the Peace Corps.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.336
Yeah. So no one I know here
can pronounce it,

02:49.419 --> 02:51.088
so I just go by her maiden name.

02:51.630 --> 02:55.342
It's just, you know, easier career wise.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.929
So, you changed your name for them?

02:59.888 --> 03:01.682
I mean, I changed it for me too.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.435
It's just less of a headache, you know?

03:05.519 --> 03:08.939
Sometimes we have to compromise.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.445
You know
they tried to airbrush my picture?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.114
For my book jacket photo.

03:17.739 --> 03:21.577
They sent me some picture that looked like
Miley Cyrus with Black girl hair.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.204
But I was like, "No."

03:24.288 --> 03:26.748
The whole point of a memoir is
to be authentic.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.542
Now, I know you're all humble and shit,

03:28.625 --> 03:31.170
but wait until you see this hotel
I'm taking you to.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.422
Actually, I booked a rental.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.342
I was just really creeped out at the idea
of staying at the Beverly Hilton.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.677
-'Cause of Whitney--
-Whitney?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.596
-Did you say Whitney?
-Get out of my head.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.432
-W-H-I-T-N-E-Y?
-Yeah. Yes, I did.

03:43.515 --> 03:44.641
I cannot write without her.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.560
-Yeah.
-I love her so much.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.105
Okay, so then where am I heading?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.357
Echo Park. Is that a place?

03:52.441 --> 03:54.693
I hope we're not going
to some sad writer apartment.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.944
No, it's cute.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.030
It's got a nice little side patio--

03:58.113 --> 04:00.282
-I'm gonna pull up the address.
-No, no, no, no.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.825
I don't-- I don't want to see it.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.077
Whatever you're gonna show, put it down.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.207
My reservation was canceled. What?

04:09.208 --> 04:11.460
How could they not verify my ID?

04:11.543 --> 04:13.629
Do they think I'm two different people?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.923
Okay, they clearly do not know
how Black hair works

04:17.007 --> 04:19.134
because one photo is--

04:19.218 --> 04:20.427
Shit!

04:20.511 --> 04:23.096
To be honest,
this trip is making me so nervous.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.266
-And LA freaks me out, so…
-Okay, how about this?

04:26.350 --> 04:29.686
I'ma book you a rental on this VIP app

04:30.562 --> 04:32.731
that Brad Pitt's assistant
gave me access to.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.317
No. That sounds way too fancy.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.569
Would you like a pool and a hot tub?

04:38.445 --> 04:41.156
Maybe a pool?
If it-- If it's not too extra.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.158
And the hot tub.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.509
Okay.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.680
See?

05:06.557 --> 05:08.308
La Casa de "We Give a Shit."

05:14.231 --> 05:15.566
What?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.150
I can't stay here.

05:17.234 --> 05:21.446
You can, and you will,
because the studio is paying for it.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.907
I'm gonna text you the door code.

05:25.117 --> 05:29.705
And I will send a car for you
tomorrow morning at 11:00 a.m.

05:29.788 --> 05:30.956
Do you need anything else?

05:31.039 --> 05:32.040
Groceries?

05:32.666 --> 05:33.667
Weed?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.045
If I do, I'll just walk.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.714
-What did you say?
-I'll walk.

05:38.797 --> 05:39.965
She said "walk."

05:41.008 --> 05:42.467
We don't say that word in LA.

05:43.969 --> 05:44.970
New Yorkers.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.685
-Hey.
-Tell me everything.

06:33.769 --> 06:36.605
Can you see the Hollywood sign
from inside your infinity pool?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.398
I don't know.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.275
I've been working since I got here.

06:40.359 --> 06:44.488
They put you in a $15 million house,
and you're sitting on the couch working?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.198
I'm prepping for tomorrow.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.201
Hold up. This place is legit 15 million?

06:49.284 --> 06:50.869
I'm an expert googler. You know that.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.789
Are you taking a dookie right now?

06:53.872 --> 06:55.749
Rude. I'm hiding from the twins.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.668
Quick, give me a tour before they find me.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.752
Okay.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.965
I mean, I'm kind of afraid to touch stuff.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.843
It's like I had a stroke
and woke up with Kanye money.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.594
If your book gets turned into a movie,

07:07.678 --> 07:10.347
I'm quitting my job
and working as your assistant.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.267
Mom, we know you're in there.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.477
I'm pooping.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.479
Gross.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.148
Mother of the year over there,
lying to those kids.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.943
Will you please keep me updated
while you're there?

07:23.026 --> 07:25.279
They're turning your book
into a fucking movie.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.448
I know. It's amazing. I just--

07:29.324 --> 07:31.660
I wish I felt less itchy about it,
you know?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.787
Come on. Impostor syndrome.

07:33.871 --> 07:37.791
You've spent years grinding it out,
writing and teaching.

07:37.875 --> 07:42.254
And we watched every sad white girl memoir
get scooped up by Hollywood.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.464
You mean, Glass Castle,

07:45.174 --> 07:47.926
Wild, Eat Pray Love,

07:48.010 --> 07:50.596
Girl, Interrupted, Julie &amp; Julia?

07:50.679 --> 07:52.890
Don't fuck with my Nora Ephron, but yes.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.059
And now we're finally paying attention
to your much more talented Black butt,

07:56.143 --> 07:57.144
and what are you doing?

07:57.227 --> 07:58.645
I came to LA.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.732
Wanda, make the most of this moment.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.527
I'm telling you, you earned it.

09:49.631 --> 09:50.632
Thanks.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.524
Here you go.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.529
Hi. Wanda Shepard.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.907
I'm here to see a bunch of people.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.658
-Have their names right here--
-That's okay.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.244
Just your ID,
and I can look you up in the system.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.916
I'm gonna grab a quick picture.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.542
Smile. Right there. Yeah.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.960
A little photo shoot?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.005
Perfect.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.550
-Take that while that prints.
-Thank you.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.599
Whoops.
Sorry, let's just try that one more time.

10:42.226 --> 10:43.227
Great.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.521
Perfect.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.276
Here we go.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.112
This camera's been acting up all day.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.322
I'm so sorry.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.953
You know what,
I-- I'm just gonna write a note.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.377
N/A?

11:09.920 --> 11:13.507
You know what? Can I get that pen
so I can write a W in the middle?

11:13.590 --> 11:14.883
Sure.

11:14.967 --> 11:15.968
Like N.W.A?

11:17.719 --> 11:18.720
That's okay.

11:18.804 --> 11:21.890
I'm going to just grab a seat. Thank you.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.114
Sorry.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.575
I just wanted to say I'm a huge fan.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.743
So sweet. Thank you.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.830
Read your book months ago.
It blew my mind.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.373
Thanks.

11:47.916 --> 11:48.917
You too?

11:50.085 --> 11:52.546
Yeah. It was only mildly humiliating.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.548
Well, that's some bullshit.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.008
It's the algorithm.

11:56.091 --> 12:00.179
Certain facial recognition programs have
a hard time detecting darker skin tones.

12:00.679 --> 12:03.223
I'm a sci-fi writer.
I know a lot about technology.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.559
Well, you should see this house
that I'm staying at.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.519
Real Jetsons vibes.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.816
You probably get asked this
all the time, but--

12:12.900 --> 12:15.611
If you have the time,
I would love to send you my script.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.448
What's it about?

12:19.531 --> 12:22.993
It's a psychosexual rom-com
about two fucked-up cyborgs.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.786
But it's also really grounded.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.914
You know,
it's kind of like the stuff you write.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.917
Oh, my God, Wanda.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.460
Girl, why didn't you text me?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.587
Nobody got you a latte.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.671
Good luck with that.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.840
Come. Thanks.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.429
Well, is there anything I need to know?
Things to avoid?

12:42.513 --> 12:43.597
Okay.

12:44.223 --> 12:46.934
Doug, head of development,
his wife is Mexican.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.769
She used to work
for the Obama administration,

12:48.852 --> 12:50.521
so he gonna talk to you like he down.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.814
-Lot of talk about "the movement."
-Okay.

12:52.898 --> 12:56.818
Brian is in charge of scripted
and fresh off of a Me Too scandal.

12:56.902 --> 12:59.029
Do not get stuck
in an elevator with Brian.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.572
Okay.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.950
Nick is new.
From what I can tell, not too important.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.701
Do not waste your eye contact on Nick.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.703
Aaron, never spoken to me.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.372
Pretty sure he doesn't know my name.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.873
I love my job. Here we go.

13:16.713 --> 13:17.714
Full disclosure…

13:18.465 --> 13:20.926
We were all, like,
very nervous about this meeting.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.970
-Nervous? Because of me?
-Yeah.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.848
Oh, please. I am so flattered right now.

13:25.931 --> 13:29.268
You guys pulled out all the stops,
and I'm so impressed.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.687
We're fucking thrilled
we got the option on your book.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.439
And now we want you to like us
and think that we're smart.

13:36.483 --> 13:40.362
Look. I'm a white guy.
From Maine, no less.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.655
And I'll be honest with you,

13:41.738 --> 13:44.783
I was not the first one in the room
to come to your book.

13:44.867 --> 13:50.330
But, once I read it, man,
it just, like, opened my eyes.

13:50.414 --> 13:53.458
I mean, your whole take
on intersectionality

13:53.542 --> 13:58.255
and your complicated feelings around BLM,

13:58.338 --> 13:59.590
it just was like…

14:01.633 --> 14:03.844
It just must be, like, really validating

14:03.927 --> 14:08.640
to have so many people just, like,
really vibing on your work.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.184
It's a little bittersweet.

14:10.267 --> 14:14.479
I mean, I kinda gave up on the idea
of being a novelist after school

14:14.563 --> 14:18.775
and then kind of just dabbled
in daily stories.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.654
Then my dad died a few years ago,

14:22.738 --> 14:26.158
and… I don't know.

14:26.241 --> 14:29.620
It finally gave me the stamina I needed

14:29.703 --> 14:33.207
to write about what happened to him
when I was younger.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.085
And then, you know, the floodgates opened,

14:37.169 --> 14:40.255
and here we are.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.091
Nineteen scenes from my life,

14:43.759 --> 14:45.052
dedicated to my dad.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.679
We're so psyched
to be doing this with you.

14:47.763 --> 14:48.889
Thank you.

14:48.972 --> 14:52.768
And I'm so excited for these stories
to reach a bigger audience.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.145
Not that books aren't big,
but y'all know what I mean.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.481
No, we love books, but, like…

14:59.024 --> 15:00.984
You know, it's like, you know, we get it.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.199
I don't know how you guys usually do this,

15:07.282 --> 15:10.911
but I drafted an outline

15:10.994 --> 15:13.121
that I can take you through for the movie.

15:14.998 --> 15:18.210
I was thinking about how,
chapter 6, I explore the--

15:18.293 --> 15:19.503
Look, Wanda.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.756
We could make a very, like,
quiet adaptation of your book

15:22.840 --> 15:27.135
that would win Best, like, Cinematography
at the Spirit Awards,

15:27.219 --> 15:31.598
but we think there's a potential
for something much more profound, special.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.141
Okay.

15:33.225 --> 15:36.937
That's actually why I invited
Aaron Fishman to join the meeting today.

15:37.020 --> 15:41.400
Aaron is the head
of our newly souped-up VR team.

15:41.900 --> 15:42.901
What's up?

15:43.986 --> 15:44.987
VR?

15:45.529 --> 15:48.156
Like virtual reality?

15:48.240 --> 15:51.785
"Virtual embodiment" is actually
the phrase we've been using.

15:52.452 --> 15:57.082
Wow, okay. So, like, a video game?

15:58.667 --> 15:59.668
No, no, no.

16:00.252 --> 16:04.840
Imagine if people could actually
walk a day in your shoes.

16:05.507 --> 16:08.427
Experience the world as you,

16:09.219 --> 16:10.345
a Black woman.

16:11.138 --> 16:14.266
It is an extraordinary opportunity
for empathy.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.062
Yeah, I hear you.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.858
-But that's not how racism works.
-Exactly.

16:22.941 --> 16:26.486
-That's exactly what we're saying.
-But, like, we'd step that out for people.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.905
Hold the audience's hand a little.

16:27.988 --> 16:32.618
In 360 degrees,
with some pretty sick parallax.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.998
I'm sorry. It feels like I'm being pitched
a version of Being Black for Dummies.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.886
So…

16:52.763 --> 16:56.225
who would play me
in this fancy VR version?

16:56.308 --> 16:57.476
And how would it work?

17:00.604 --> 17:01.980
Like, who would play me?

17:03.941 --> 17:05.067
What would you see?

17:14.492 --> 17:15.827
Are you all right?

17:15.911 --> 17:17.287
You're not saying anything.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.998
-We're here to answer any questions.
-What?

17:20.665 --> 17:21.959
I was talking.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.377
My voice craps out
when I get stressed out too.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.046
There's nothing to worry about.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.964
I'm not worried, and I'm not stressed.

17:28.048 --> 17:31.844
I just don't understand why you guys
aren't answering any of my questions.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.475
Who would play me?

17:42.896 --> 17:43.897
Look.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.067
We've thrown a huge curveball at you.

17:47.693 --> 17:50.696
I totally get that this might take
a second to process.

17:50.779 --> 17:53.031
Let's do sup-- Let's have dinner.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.616
Let's do it. Okay. You know what?

17:54.700 --> 17:56.535
Everyone's coming over
to my house tonight.

17:56.618 --> 17:57.911
It's a pretty dope pad.

17:57.995 --> 17:59.663
You can check out the prototype.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.165
And my assistant will tell you
the address, okay?

18:08.630 --> 18:10.007
Hey, Little Miss Hollywood. How'd--

18:10.090 --> 18:12.926
They wanna turn my fucking book into
a racist science experiment.

18:13.010 --> 18:15.554
Wan, slow down. What's happening?

18:16.054 --> 18:19.224
It's not a movie.
It's a-- It's virtual reality.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.018
Okay.

18:21.101 --> 18:25.731
Not what we expected,
but my kids love virtual reality.

18:25.814 --> 18:28.442
And it's fucking funny
watching them punch at the air.

18:28.525 --> 18:31.612
And there must be tons of money in that.
Did they give you a number?

18:31.695 --> 18:32.779
I didn't ask.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.073
You're way too modest.
That'd be my first question.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.743
Well, they weren't interested
in questions, Lu.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.078
The minute I asked something
remotely challenging,

18:40.162 --> 18:41.246
their eyes glazed over.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.165
And the one time I asked a question,

18:43.248 --> 18:45.584
they pretended like they didn't hear
anything I said.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.045
Okay, breathe. They adore you.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.589
They flew you all the way out there.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.508
They wanna whitewash my story, Lu.

18:52.591 --> 18:54.968
So tell them that won't fly.

18:55.052 --> 18:57.012
No, I know. I will, but--

18:57.095 --> 18:59.181
Wan, you're a big shot now.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.849
You're in the driver's seat.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.935
So just go back in there

19:03.018 --> 19:06.522
and tell them that your life isn't
some fucking Sims game.

19:06.605 --> 19:10.609
Or, if it is, then they have to pay you,
like, $800 million.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.321
I'm supposed to go to this dinner tonight.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.491
Perfect. You'll drink some wine,
be more relaxed.

19:17.574 --> 19:18.659
Says you.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.870
I gotta walk in there like a boss,
and I only brought one cute outfit.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.664
I don't have any bad bitch clothes.

19:23.747 --> 19:26.124
Girl, you got pocket money. Go spend it.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.722
Get your little butt off of me.
Are you out of your damn mind?

19:40.806 --> 19:42.432
Shit. I didn't see you.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.227
You didn't see me here?
I'm sitting right here.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.562
I'm so sorry. My bad.

19:58.991 --> 20:00.033
Okay.

20:05.414 --> 20:06.957
See, that's how they get you.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.457
-Next.
-Hi.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.918
-Hey, good choice.
-Thanks.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.295
-Hopefully it fits post-baby.
-Excuse me. I was here first.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.672
This color looks fantastic.
It looks great on everyone.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.300
Excuse me.

20:58.383 --> 20:59.676
Thanks.

21:01.887 --> 21:04.681
You are going to look fantastic
this weekend.

21:04.765 --> 21:08.435
-When did you say you're due?
-Okay. Since y'all wanna be Karens.

21:09.228 --> 21:11.188
Y'all are lucky I have somewhere to be

21:12.356 --> 21:16.527
and I can pay for this dress
with my fancy per diem.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.013
Blake!

21:46.181 --> 21:47.391
Blake!

21:47.474 --> 21:48.851
Jesus!

21:56.233 --> 21:57.568
Blake-- Wait!

22:01.738 --> 22:02.739
Shit.

22:02.823 --> 22:03.991
Fuck.

22:22.134 --> 22:24.052
Okay. It's only four miles.

23:31.537 --> 23:33.080
Doug, can we talk?

23:34.831 --> 23:37.876
I've been thinking a lot about this, and--

23:37.960 --> 23:38.961
Has anyone seen her?

23:40.170 --> 23:42.089
-No.
-What?

23:42.172 --> 23:43.340
So weird.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.468
I'm here.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.724
-So, should we just get started?
-No, I'm here!

23:52.808 --> 23:54.434
I guess so. Yeah.

23:54.518 --> 23:56.854
Let's try out the demo.
Let's test it, right?

23:56.937 --> 24:01.275
Yeah, it might even be
more comfortable without her.

24:01.984 --> 24:03.652
Comfortable for who, Fishman?

24:05.654 --> 24:07.990
I can hear you. I'm right fucking here.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.575
Okay, everybody.

24:09.658 --> 24:12.077
We're gonna try this out,
but just a heads-up,

24:12.160 --> 24:15.497
there's some pretty heavy stuff here,
so consider this your trigger warning.

24:15.581 --> 24:18.375
Spoiler alert.
Ruin the ending, why don't you?

24:18.458 --> 24:21.670
Okay. Look, Aaron,
a lot of sensitive material here,

24:21.753 --> 24:26.717
so if anybody is uncomfortable with that,
please know you don't have to watch.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.261
We want to know about what you think
about the experience.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.096
Which chapter should we start with?

24:31.180 --> 24:33.432
I mean, let's start with chapter 6.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.268
That's the big one.

24:36.351 --> 24:39.021
So let's just dive
right into the deep end.

24:39.730 --> 24:40.939
Wow.

24:41.690 --> 24:42.691
Here we go.

24:44.735 --> 24:46.236
Holy shit.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.037
This is next level.

25:09.801 --> 25:10.802
Where--

25:24.149 --> 25:25.275
Dad?

25:26.401 --> 25:27.653
Oh, my God.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.165
Hey, Wanda.

25:40.249 --> 25:41.375
Hi, Mr. D!

25:41.875 --> 25:45.587
Carl. Haven't seen you for a minute.
You doing okay?

25:45.671 --> 25:47.631
You know, still breathing.

25:48.257 --> 25:49.341
Oh, my God.

25:49.925 --> 25:51.844
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.140
Hey. Hey, hey.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.101
-We got a report of a robbery on Lenox.
-Dad, no.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.687
-Suspect is armed. Can I see your ID?
-No, no. Excuse me--

26:01.770 --> 26:03.564
-You have the wrong guy!
-Stop!

26:03.647 --> 26:05.315
-I know him.
-Leave him alone!

26:06.191 --> 26:07.192
Daddy!

26:07.276 --> 26:08.735
-Look, I know my rights.
-Hey!

26:08.819 --> 26:10.779
-I haven't done anything wrong!
-Hey! Get off him!

26:10.863 --> 26:12.948
Get off of her! Get off of her!

26:13.031 --> 26:16.118
Get up, baby. Baby! Baby!

26:17.077 --> 26:19.746
-No, get off of her!
-I know him! It's--

26:20.706 --> 26:23.166
Look. I know my rights. You can't do this.

26:23.250 --> 26:24.793
I know him!

26:28.881 --> 26:30.883
Wait, why'd it go dark like that?

26:31.508 --> 26:33.302
That's when she lost consciousness.

26:35.012 --> 26:37.848
Yeah. What happened to her again?

26:39.099 --> 26:41.101
She had a giant panic attack.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.562
Was taken to a local hospital.

26:49.193 --> 26:50.402
It's so weird.

27:05.209 --> 27:06.210
Wanda?

27:10.172 --> 27:11.632
You can see me?

27:14.468 --> 27:15.469
Yeah.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.143
Can I sit?

27:27.105 --> 27:28.565
What are you doing out here?

27:31.401 --> 27:32.402
Are you okay?

27:39.535 --> 27:40.702
No.

27:47.334 --> 27:48.669
I don't know what I am.

28:03.684 --> 28:04.935
Yes, you do.

28:25.664 --> 28:26.707
You know what?

28:30.419 --> 28:31.503
Fuck this.

28:37.968 --> 28:39.511
I'm going back in there.
