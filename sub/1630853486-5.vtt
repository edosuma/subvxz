- In the Belkarian faith, to wear clothing
on the first day of the month

10:35.385 --> 10:37.930
is considered an affront
to the work of the Spirit Lord.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.098

Ensign, you must know a uniform

in engineering?

10:48.732 --> 10:49.942
He does not wear a uniform.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.985
- Unk is half the size of a shuttlecraft.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.153
He'd have to wear a tent.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.365

all cultural traditions.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.659

10:59.117 --> 11:01.537
Look, I don't want to disrespect
your religion,

11:01.537 --> 11:04.039

11:04.039 --> 11:06.291

12:00.846 --> 12:04.558

that's called ass kissing.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.187
Will it be on the entrance exam?

12:08.187 --> 12:09.938
- [laughs] No, it won't be.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.108
I know a lot of this seems pretty dull,

12:13.108 --> 12:16.278
but Union service is
as much about mundane busy work

12:16.278 --> 12:17.696
as it is about adventure.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.907
- No, it is not dull.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.491
I want to know everything.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.118
- Yeah, you say that now...

12:23.118 --> 12:25.204
- If I can ask, Commander,

12:25.204 --> 12:27.372
why did you choose to join the Fleet?

12:28.207 --> 12:32.169
- I was always someone
who was comfortable with responsibility.

12:32.169 --> 12:36.423
I was usually the one who volunteered
to watch the younger kids on a field trip,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.467
or captain the soccer team.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.637
And I liked the satisfaction

12:41.637 --> 12:44.348
of helping other people succeed
at their jobs.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.475
I knew a command position in the Fleet

12:46.475 --> 12:49.228
would mean a long,
slow climb through a system,

12:49.228 --> 12:51.939
but I also knew it would be worth it.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.358
What about you? Why do you want to join?

12:57.569 --> 13:00.113
- Ever since I was a young child,

13:00.113 --> 13:02.115
I have always felt...

13:02.824 --> 13:04.117
incomplete.

13:04.952 --> 13:09.456
As if the person I am today is a bookmark.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.961
A placeholder, until I discover who I am.

13:15.003 --> 13:19.633
I have not found the answer at home,
so perhaps it is out among the stars.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.679
- You've... felt this way for some time?

13:23.679 --> 13:25.973
- I once heard Dr. Finn say that,

13:25.973 --> 13:28.350
"If you wake up in the middle of the night

13:28.350 --> 13:31.979
"and there is nothing
to keep you from falling asleep again,

13:31.979 --> 13:33.939
it means you are happy."

13:36.900 --> 13:38.402
I think that maybe...

13:39.653 --> 13:41.446
I am not happy.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.825
- You don't sleep well?

13:45.951 --> 13:50.664
- I always feel as if...
there is something wrong with me.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.208
But I cannot tell what.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.337
Lieutenant Malloy says
many people my age feel this way.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.132
Perhaps it is normal.

14:05.637 --> 14:09.474
- Lieutenant Felina's doing much better
after the neural regeneration therapy,

14:09.474 --> 14:11.935
so I'd say it's safe to put her back
on limited duty.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.646
- All right, I'll have Kelly
put her back on the roster.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.273

You guys busy?

What's going on?

14:36.418 --> 14:37.711

14:37.711 --> 14:41.465

to take over the excavation.

14:43.175 --> 14:45.761

so enjoy it while it lasts.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.066

15:01.443 --> 15:05.364
- I think that, at some point,
possibly soon...

15:05.948 --> 15:09.618
the person he is and the person he was...

15:10.244 --> 15:12.037
are going to collide with each other.

15:12.538 --> 15:14.164
- Has he said something to you?

15:14.164 --> 15:16.416
- In a general sense, yes.

drop by my office?

15:30.389 --> 15:31.723
He and I can have a talk,

15:31.723 --> 15:35.477
and it will allow me
to do a casual evaluation.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.521
- It might be a little early for that.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.399
He confided in me and it's

15:40.399 --> 15:43.235

as a breach of trust at this point.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.445

15:48.115 --> 15:49.408

I feel like a horrible person.

lying to him with my silence.

of the navigational array.

I had an ulterior motive
for putting Topa to work at dinnertime.

17:11.532 --> 17:13.408
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

17:13.408 --> 17:14.368
- What is it?

17:16.203 --> 17:18.872
- I understand that it's inappropriate
within your culture

17:18.872 --> 17:21.208

17:21.208 --> 17:23.961
have you two ever discussed telling Topa?

17:23.961 --> 17:25.128
About his origins?

17:25.128 --> 17:26.839
- You are correct, Commander.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.841
It is entirely inappropriate!

17:28.841 --> 17:31.051
How dare you enter our home and--

17:31.051 --> 17:32.469
- Klyden!

17:35.681 --> 17:39.351
We have discussed the matter
on several occasions, and we feel--

17:39.351 --> 17:41.895

down through the years.

17:57.035 --> 18:00.038

He will outgrow it.

- I don't want to betray his confidence
if he hasn't said anything to you,

but he thinks there's something
wrong with him.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.755

- He doesn't know.

Look, everyone at this table is aware

18:14.219 --> 18:16.638

without their knowledge or consent--

18:16.638 --> 18:19.474

18:19.474 --> 18:20.934
You may go now.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.444

I apologize for disturbing your evening.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.163

- No!

18:41.163 --> 18:42.873

18:42.873 --> 18:44.374
- She is a female!

18:44.374 --> 18:47.211
With no understanding of our culture!

18:47.211 --> 18:49.004
- If Topa is struggling--

18:49.004 --> 18:53.634

compared to the struggle he would face

I would have been spared

19:20.285 --> 19:24.164

that I was born female?

19:24.957 --> 19:29.670

to endure such a life!

I love him with all my heart! Do you?

19:33.382 --> 19:34.341
- Of course, I do!

44:51.441 --> 44:53.819
- Bortus, have you lost your mind?!

44:54.945 --> 44:58.282
- Claire, is this an issue
of personal identity alone,

44:58.282 --> 44:59.366
or has Topa...?

44:59.366 --> 45:02.953
- Topa has asked me
to reverse the procedure, yes.

45:02.953 --> 45:06.248
She wants her physical body
to represent its origins.

45:06.248 --> 45:08.125
- And obviously that's possible.

45:08.125 --> 45:10.752
- It is possible, yes. And very simple.

45:10.752 --> 45:12.087
- You are a doctor!

45:12.087 --> 45:17.176
You must realize that Topa
is too young to make this decision!

45:17.176 --> 45:18.802
- Are you hearing yourself?

45:18.802 --> 45:22.055
Seriously, are you completely oblivious
to the hypocrisy of what you just said?

45:22.055 --> 45:23.182
- He is an adolescent!

45:23.182 --> 45:24.808
- She was a baby!
- Doctor.

45:27.436 --> 45:30.272
Is there any psychological risk?

45:31.481 --> 45:35.110
- Under normal circumstances,
I couldn't do what's being asked

45:35.110 --> 45:37.279
until the child reached adulthood,

45:37.279 --> 45:40.824
but, to be blunt,
Topa's history makes it all a wash.

45:40.824 --> 45:42.951
It's impactful either way.

45:42.951 --> 45:45.871
So, in my professional opinion,
the tipping factor

45:45.871 --> 45:47.789
should be the wishes of Topa herself.

45:47.789 --> 45:50.542
And there's a very reasonable argument

45:50.542 --> 45:53.170
that we'd simply be restoring
what was taken from her.

45:53.170 --> 45:56.465
- It is immoral, and it is illegal!

45:56.465 --> 45:58.550
- On Moclus. We're not on Moclus.

45:58.550 --> 46:00.219
- I forbid it!
- It's not up to you.

46:00.219 --> 46:02.971
- I am his father!
- And so is Bortus.

46:05.641 --> 46:07.935
- Where medical issues are concerned,

46:07.935 --> 46:11.897
Union law states that if a child
is not of legal age

46:11.897 --> 46:13.690
to make the decision on their own,

46:13.690 --> 46:18.028
it requires the consent
of at least one parent or guardian.

46:18.028 --> 46:19.696
Doesn't require both.

46:22.074 --> 46:23.575
- Bortus?

46:30.624 --> 46:32.501
- If you do this...

46:33.168 --> 46:35.462
I will leave you.

46:35.462 --> 46:37.506
I swear it.

46:37.506 --> 46:42.386
And I will not even give you
the dignity of the sword.

46:48.684 --> 46:49.893
- Captain.

46:50.519 --> 46:54.857
There is another factor
that we have not discussed.

46:54.857 --> 46:56.108
- I know.

46:57.526 --> 47:03.031
Even with Bortus's consent,
it may not be that simple.

47:05.742 --> 47:08.871
- You should know that this is not
something we take lightly.

47:09.663 --> 47:11.832
The Union council conferred
with the Admiralty

47:11.832 --> 47:14.501
for no less than nine hours
on the subject.

47:14.501 --> 47:16.128
But it is abundantly clear

47:16.128 --> 47:19.590
that this would deeply imperil
our relationship with the Moclans.

47:19.590 --> 47:23.385
With the Krill treaty in ruins
and the Kaylon waiting at our doorstep,

47:23.385 --> 47:25.470
we just can't take the risk.

47:25.470 --> 47:28.390
Therefore, Dr. Finn,

47:28.390 --> 47:32.311
it is my unhappy duty to order you
not to perform this procedure.

47:32.311 --> 47:33.353
- What?

47:33.353 --> 47:35.147
GRAYSON:
Excuse me, sir.

47:35.147 --> 47:37.649
We have checked every legal box.

47:37.649 --> 47:40.444
Topa has requested it.
Bortus has consented.

47:40.444 --> 47:42.696
Everyone involved
is within their legal rights.

47:42.696 --> 47:45.115
- Civil law permits it, you are correct.

47:45.115 --> 47:47.492
But you're on a Fleet ship
with a Fleet doctor.

47:47.492 --> 47:49.369
We can't allow it.

47:49.369 --> 47:53.123
- Sir, I understand the danger, but...

47:53.123 --> 47:56.043
how the hell much longer
are we going to let this go on?

47:56.043 --> 47:58.003
I mean, you are basically
allowing the Moclans

47:58.003 --> 48:00.464
to dictate human rights policy
for the Union.

48:00.464 --> 48:03.383
- I don't want this to drag on
any more than you do, Captain.

48:03.383 --> 48:05.594
You don't think I hate making this call?

48:05.594 --> 48:08.764
But we're desperately trying
to save lives here.

48:08.764 --> 48:12.601
Without the Moclans, we become
utterly vulnerable to the Kaylon.

48:12.601 --> 48:16.605
This procedure won't help Topa
if she's dead.

48:16.605 --> 48:18.273
- Can we speak to Rechik?

48:18.273 --> 48:20.150
- Rechik wanted to be in this meeting

48:20.150 --> 48:22.277
along with the two other
Moclan councilmen.

48:22.277 --> 48:25.531
I told him no.
Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.

48:25.531 --> 48:28.700
This issue is a lightning rod
for the Moclans.

48:28.700 --> 48:31.578
The trial was
a defining moment that, to them,

48:31.578 --> 48:33.789
reinforced their cultural foundations.

48:33.789 --> 48:37.251
I'm telling you, I have been
doing this job a long time.

48:37.251 --> 48:40.087
If we defy their custom
and invalidate that verdict

48:40.087 --> 48:43.799
by allowing a Union medical officer
to do this,

48:43.799 --> 48:45.676
the Moclans will be humiliated,

48:45.676 --> 48:50.055
and trust me, they will walk,
and billions could die as a result.

48:50.055 --> 48:52.391
- Would the Moclans
really want to cut ties

48:52.391 --> 48:53.725
and face the Kaylon alone?

48:53.725 --> 48:55.519
- Want is irrelevant.

48:55.519 --> 48:58.272
They'd have no way to save face
if they didn't.

48:59.106 --> 49:02.693
- Admiral. You have children, don't you?

49:04.152 --> 49:05.153
- Yes.

49:05.737 --> 49:09.575
- If Topa was your child,
how would you explain this to her?

49:09.575 --> 49:12.494
That we're forcing her to spend
the rest of her days

49:12.494 --> 49:15.956
living a lie to protect
the political status quo?

49:15.956 --> 49:20.002
- If Topa wants to leave the ship
and have the procedure done elsewhere,

49:20.002 --> 49:21.628
we have no jurisdiction.

49:22.212 --> 49:23.672
- She would not succeed.

49:23.672 --> 49:26.383
- The Moclans would pounce on her
without Union protection.

49:26.383 --> 49:29.261
She'd be captured
and sent to prison in a heartbeat.

49:29.261 --> 49:32.306

49:32.306 --> 49:34.224
Please believe me.

49:34.224 --> 49:36.476
But our hands are tied.

49:46.987 --> 49:48.822
How are we going to tell her?

49:50.240 --> 49:52.492

52:46.708 --> 52:48.377
very noble.

But you've dedicated
your entire career to the Fleet.

become a target for the Moclans.

53:00.472 --> 53:03.684
- But it would give the Admirals
plausible deniability.

53:03.684 --> 53:04.893
- Technically.

53:04.893 --> 53:08.021
- And the Moclans could remain
in the Union and still save face.

53:08.021 --> 53:09.648

- You've been pretty reclusive lately.

1:09:53.777 --> 1:09:57.197
ISAAC: Since the Hemblicite artifacts
have been offloaded to the Newton,

1:09:57.197 --> 1:09:58.407
I have had the opportunity

1:09:58.407 --> 1:10:01.243

1:10:17.092 --> 1:10:19.553
Maybe that means something to you?

1:10:19.553 --> 1:10:20.846
ISAAC: It does not.

1:10:22.097 --> 1:10:23.098

1:10:34.776 --> 1:10:36.862

1:10:36.862 --> 1:10:38.405
This is understandable.

1:10:38.405 --> 1:10:42.784
Given their affection for Topa,
I reasoned that by assisting her,

1:10:42.784 --> 1:10:45.412
I could improve my standing
aboard the Orville.
