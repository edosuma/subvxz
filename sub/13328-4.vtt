00:16.959 --> 00:19.750
( theme music playing )

00:49.792 --> 00:51.208
Hey, Murray.

00:51.208 --> 00:52.625
Nice shorts.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.417
Okay, guys,

00:55.417 --> 00:56.708
time for the interesting
buildings tour.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.458
This week
it's band rotundas.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.959
Ugh. It should be called
the "boring buildings tour."

01:00.959 --> 01:03.166
Why?
Because it's boring.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.208
It's not boring.
There's a real buzz about it.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.708
Everyone's talking
about these tours.

01:06.708 --> 01:07.959
Who's talking about it?

01:07.959 --> 01:09.875
Bret, you were talking
about it last week.

01:09.875 --> 01:11.708
I was saying it's boring.
Murray: Oh, were you?

01:11.708 --> 01:13.208
Well, you were still
talking about it.

01:13.208 --> 01:14.959
Murray, I can't go this week.
I'm going on a date.

01:14.959 --> 01:17.625
What? A date?
Yeah, I'm going on a date
with a girl from work.

01:17.625 --> 01:20.291
What are you gonna do?
I think we're gonna
watch a DVD.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.333
Bret, I've had this
organized for ages.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.834
You knew about that.
I was gonna tell you
the difference

01:24.834 --> 01:26.959
between, you know,
gazebos and band shells.

01:26.959 --> 01:28.792
Jemaine:
Yeah, Bret,
you've got to come.

01:28.792 --> 01:30.667
Why don't we just
postpone the tour,
just go next week?

01:30.667 --> 01:32.583
It's not as easy as that!
I've got the schedule.

01:32.583 --> 01:36.583
Look, it's all time-tabled.
I made those for you.

01:36.583 --> 01:40.834
"Friday, 4:05 pm:
Bret, Jemaine and Murray
leave Dave's shop."

01:42.667 --> 01:46.125
Well, I guess I'll just
have to go with you, Jemaine.
Just the two of us.

01:46.125 --> 01:48.166
Ah. Except I just remembered

01:48.166 --> 01:49.792
that I also can't go.

01:49.792 --> 01:51.959
Why? I suppose you've
got a date as well, have you?

01:51.959 --> 01:53.458
Yeah.
Oh yeah?

01:53.458 --> 01:56.166
Where'd you meet her?
At-- at the library.

01:56.166 --> 01:58.417
Library?
What library?

01:58.417 --> 02:00.041
Video library.
Ha-ha-ha!

02:00.041 --> 02:02.667
Video library.
No such thing.

02:02.667 --> 02:04.834
Gotcha.
No, that's fine.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.291
I'll go on my own.
That's fine.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.959
Enjoy your date, Bret,
and your pretend date,
Jemaine.

02:09.959 --> 02:12.542
All right?
The video library--
that's fine.

02:12.542 --> 02:14.583
I won't say goodbye,
I don't feel like it.

02:14.583 --> 02:16.417
Bret:
See you, Murray.

02:18.708 --> 02:21.000
Bye, Murray.
Bye. You gonna say "bye"?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.333
No!

02:24.291 --> 02:27.000
Bret:
The carrots
were really nice.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.125
And the broccoli was
really nice as well.

02:30.125 --> 02:32.166
Yeah.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.834
It did turn out
really nice.

02:33.834 --> 02:36.291
Yeah, really nice.
It was really nice.

02:36.291 --> 02:38.500
Yeah, it was
really nice.

02:40.708 --> 02:42.667
Like your eyes--

02:42.667 --> 02:45.542
I could look
at them for ages.

02:45.542 --> 02:48.417
The eggs were really nice
like your lips.

02:48.417 --> 02:51.417
So... your lips
look delicious like...

02:51.417 --> 02:53.333
as delicious
as the eggs.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.959
( laughs )
Probably more delicious.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.583
Do-- do you want
to kiss me?

03:02.583 --> 03:04.208
Oh yes, please.

03:06.208 --> 03:09.000
Are we gonna watch
a DVD or what?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.208
I think it might
be a bit late
for a DVD, man.

03:11.208 --> 03:14.417
No, it's okay.
We just have to keep
the volume down

03:14.417 --> 03:16.625
because my roommate
is sleeping.

03:16.625 --> 03:19.083
( sighs )
No, well, we should
probably get home.

03:19.083 --> 03:20.500
It's pretty late.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.792
Well, maybe I'll stay
a little bit longer.

03:22.792 --> 03:24.458
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.

03:24.458 --> 03:27.333
Do you wanna--
you could stay over
if-- if you want?

03:27.333 --> 03:29.458
No, I don't
want to stay over.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.125
No, we should
get going.

03:31.125 --> 03:34.792
I don't know-- why don't
I stay and you go?

03:34.792 --> 03:37.041
No, it's okay, I don't mind,
I'll stay here.

03:37.041 --> 03:38.875
Whatever you want.

03:38.875 --> 03:41.333
( Jemaine sighs )

03:47.458 --> 03:50.417
( watch alarm sounds )

03:57.708 --> 04:01.708
Hey, Jemaine,
I've written this
love song for Coco.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.250
Oh, yeah?
Would you be able
to have a listen?

04:04.250 --> 04:06.959
Give me a bit
of feedback?
Yeah.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.792

it's good.

04:59.792 --> 05:02.625
Okay.
It's two hours long.

05:02.625 --> 05:05.458
Yeah.
Anything else?

05:05.458 --> 05:08.000
Um, yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.041
Let's see...

05:20.708 --> 05:23.208
Okay.
( clears throat )

05:23.208 --> 05:26.041
Okay. "I'd climb
the highest mountain."

05:26.041 --> 05:29.208
Would you
actually do that?
Probably not.

05:29.208 --> 05:31.166
Well, you're sort of
promising that you would.

05:31.166 --> 05:33.875
That's a metaphor.
Oh, is it?
Oh, okay.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.542
Yeah.
What's it a metaphor for?

05:35.542 --> 05:37.583
For-- that I'd do
anything for her.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.834
Would you climb the highest
mountain for her?

05:39.834 --> 05:41.959
Oh, God.
I see.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.834
No.
Pass me that?

05:43.834 --> 05:46.083
No, I wouldn't do
a lot of this stuff.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.708
Would you swallow
a whole sword?

05:47.708 --> 05:51.083
A sword-- okay,
I probably wouldn't
do that one either.

05:51.083 --> 05:54.041
Yeah, maybe you should
make it more realistic
things you'd do,

05:54.041 --> 05:55.792
Some other things.
Like what?

05:55.792 --> 05:57.542
Uh, "I would hang out
with you."

05:57.542 --> 06:00.834
Oh, that's good.
That's good, that's really...
That's not bad.

06:00.834 --> 06:03.125
That's a lyric of mine.
You can use that.

06:03.125 --> 06:04.750
Just "Hang out
with you."

06:04.750 --> 06:06.417
What about making it
more personal?

06:06.417 --> 06:08.542
Things about her.
What do you know
that's specific to Coco?

06:08.542 --> 06:11.959
She has a rash that she
doesn't tell anyone about.

06:11.959 --> 06:13.250
What-- what else?

06:13.250 --> 06:15.583
She likes food.
Yeah, okay.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.583
Her flatmate
is called Stuart.

06:17.583 --> 06:20.166
Yeah.
This is all good stuff.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.250
All right, let's
get started, shall we?

06:24.250 --> 06:27.166
Can I just say it's good
to have a lady's touch
in the office?

06:27.166 --> 06:28.834
Doesn't happen
very often.

06:28.834 --> 06:32.542
( giggling )
All right, second annual
fan-club meeting.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.792
President.
Present.

06:34.792 --> 06:37.792
Secretary.
Present.

06:37.792 --> 06:40.375
Treasurer.
Present!

06:40.375 --> 06:42.792
Maybe we should just
make that one title?
Sure.

06:42.792 --> 06:45.166
It's all--
it's quite convoluted.
You're all three.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.792
Sure.
And Murray, present.

06:47.792 --> 06:50.959
All right, item one:
Any more fans?

06:50.959 --> 06:53.291
No.
Sorry, Murray.

06:53.291 --> 06:56.291
Really?
No.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.750
All right,
let's move on.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.041
Item two:
The new newsletter.

07:00.041 --> 07:02.000
Really good idea.
Like it.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.208
Thank you.
Really good.

07:03.208 --> 07:04.834
In fact, I've got
some photos here.

07:04.834 --> 07:08.000
I took some of Bret--
Well, actually I found them,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.166
I-- when I was
round at his flat.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.000
Oh-ho!
That--
he's asleep there,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.500
and so you could
put those in the newsletter.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.834
Mm-mm,
mm-mm-mmm! Mmm!

07:16.834 --> 07:20.125
Oh, my God.

07:23.458 --> 07:25.041
What's this one?
Mmm?

07:25.041 --> 07:27.542
What's this one?
God, how did that
get in there? Sorry.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.500
It must have slipped
in with the--

07:29.500 --> 07:31.542
Do you want to
hold onto that?
No.

07:31.542 --> 07:33.500
No. So...
So...

07:33.500 --> 07:35.041
It's...

07:36.166 --> 07:37.959
All right.
Item three.

07:37.959 --> 07:40.834
Now if one of
the band members was
to have a girlfriend...

07:40.834 --> 07:41.917
Mmm.

07:41.917 --> 07:43.875
...would you find that:
a) very positive;

07:43.875 --> 07:47.000
b) positive--
Why do you--
why do you ask?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.625
No reason.
Has Bret got
a girlfriend?

07:50.625 --> 07:52.875
Yes, he's seeing
a girl from work--

07:52.875 --> 07:55.083
Coco.
( pencil point breaks )

07:55.083 --> 07:56.750
Oh.
( chuckles )

07:56.750 --> 08:00.875
Wow. Well, that's great
that Bret has a girlfriend.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.417
That's really great.
You don't think Bret's
any less available

08:03.417 --> 08:05.458
now that he's...?
Well, no!
No.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.208
Is she pretty?
You're still interested
in the band then,

08:08.208 --> 08:11.375
even though it's...?
Yes, it's nice for Bret
to have a girlfriend.

08:11.375 --> 08:12.542
Good.
Yes.

08:12.542 --> 08:14.875
All right.
You sure?
Yes!
( laughs )

08:14.875 --> 08:17.041
Is she stupid?
You've still got
Jemaine anyway.

08:17.041 --> 08:19.041
I mean, he's always
available, isn't he?
Yeah.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.333
He's not gonna--
not gonna get a girlfriend
anytime soon.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.834
So...
Does, um...

08:22.834 --> 08:24.667
Try your chances
with him, can't you?
Mm-hmm.

08:24.667 --> 08:28.708
Does-- does Bret's
girlfriend look
anything like me?

08:28.708 --> 08:32.458
Little bit?
A little bit--
around the eyes.

08:32.458 --> 08:35.583
Oh yeah?
Big eyes, huh?

08:35.583 --> 08:37.417
Well, she's--
she's got eyes.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.750
Yeah.

08:41.208 --> 08:43.583
You want some
more macaroni?
No, I'm okay.

08:43.583 --> 08:46.458
You sure?
I was gonna have some
fruit salad or something.

08:46.458 --> 08:49.250
Do you want anything?
No, I'm fine.

08:49.250 --> 08:52.250
Um, actually, I've--
I've written you a song, Coco.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.750
Really? You didn't
need to do that.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.458
Well, Jemaine helped.

08:56.458 --> 08:57.917
That's so sweet.

08:57.917 --> 09:00.083
It's called
"If You're Into It."

09:00.083 --> 09:01.375
Okay.

That was great.

10:44.542 --> 10:47.291
Thank you too, Jemaine.
Oh, it was no problem.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.375
So, what are we
gonna do now?

10:49.375 --> 10:51.083
Well, we were gonna
go cycling.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.166
Yeah.
Oh, were we?

10:54.166 --> 10:56.500
Oh, great.

10:57.291 --> 11:00.208
( pop music playing )

11:24.250 --> 11:27.458
Kiss her, Bret.
Kiss her.

11:37.333 --> 11:41.083
Hey Bret,
I've been thinking
about these dates.

11:41.083 --> 11:43.250
Oh yeah?
Yeah.

11:43.250 --> 11:46.417
Yeah, actually, I was gonna
say-- I was
thinking that maybe--

11:46.417 --> 11:48.417
I've been thinking,
you know, they're a bit--

11:48.417 --> 11:50.500
They're a bit girlie.
Well, Coco's a girl.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.792
Yeah, but I'm not, though.
It's not just you and her
going on these dates,

11:53.792 --> 11:57.291
I'm there too.
So what about thinking about
something I might like to do,

11:57.291 --> 11:58.375
like paintball?

11:58.375 --> 12:00.125
We could watch
a kickboxing championship.

12:00.125 --> 12:02.041
Um, yeah.
You know,
that sort of thing.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.041
Maybe--
Or a strip bar?
We could go to a strip bar?

12:04.041 --> 12:06.500
She doesn't like--
she doesn't want to go
to a strip bar again.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.667
I was actually
wondering--

12:07.667 --> 12:09.000
We could go to just
a topless bar.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.917
There's just
topless bars as well.

12:10.917 --> 12:12.792
But I was thinking
maybe her and I'd like--

12:12.792 --> 12:15.625
Or she doesn't always
have to come as well.
That's another option.

12:15.625 --> 12:18.458
Me and you could go on
one of these date--
Oh, that'd be weird.

12:18.458 --> 12:22.291
Yeah, I was thinking maybe
just her and I would go
on a date without you.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.125
Maybe.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.917
Why?
Oh no,
don't worry about it.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.959
No-- no, come on.
You brought it up, so--
Well...

12:28.959 --> 12:31.000
Just 'cause I never get to
hang out with just her.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.500
You hang out with her
all the time.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.166
Yeah, but you're
always  there.
Oh, so are you.

12:35.166 --> 12:36.792
You're always there.
I always see you there.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.834
Yeah, I'm always there,
but she's my girlfriend.

12:38.834 --> 12:41.500
Yes. Good point.
Yes, good point.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.166
And, uh...

12:43.166 --> 12:46.166
Coco said that
the other night when
I went to the bathroom

12:46.166 --> 12:49.166
that she felt
like you...

12:49.166 --> 12:50.917
like made a move on her.
Yep.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.166
Yep, guilty,
I did.

12:52.166 --> 12:54.166
But you weren't doing
anything, so I thought--

12:54.166 --> 12:55.917
Yeah, but that's 'cause
you were there.

12:55.917 --> 12:57.875
Ah!
Of course I was there.
You can't do that.

12:57.875 --> 13:00.375
You're definitely not
coming on my next date.
Okay.

13:00.375 --> 13:02.834
Well, that's fine.
That's all you needed to say.

13:02.834 --> 13:04.208
Okay.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.375
Good night.
Good night.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.959
Murray:
Look at that.

13:17.959 --> 13:19.875
Classic
Robert Moses design.

13:19.875 --> 13:22.750
See the band shell,
Jemaine?

13:22.750 --> 13:24.792
Where's your
fact sheet?

13:24.792 --> 13:26.166
You should be
checking this out.

13:26.166 --> 13:27.792
I don't know,
I left it at home.

13:27.792 --> 13:29.750
"Julius Caesar" was
done here in 1957.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.375
Really.
Joseph Papp's.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.875
Oh.
Amazing.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.333
Amazing.
You think this is good?

13:34.333 --> 13:36.000
You missed some of
the best band shells

13:36.000 --> 13:38.583
and some awesome
rotundas when you were
on all those dates.

13:38.583 --> 13:39.917
Where's your
date tonight?

13:39.917 --> 13:42.166
Uh, Bret asked me not to
come on his dates anymore.

13:42.166 --> 13:45.583
What? You were going
on their dates?
I know, yeah.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.375
You don't go on
other people's dates.

13:47.375 --> 13:48.875
I thought you had
your own date.

13:48.875 --> 13:50.750
No,
I was dating them.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.041
You don't do that.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.291
That's crazy.
It's not crazy.

13:56.291 --> 13:58.333
Are you okay?
Are your feelings hurt?

13:58.333 --> 13:59.458
No.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.250
They must be.
Are they?
No.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.834
A little bit?
No.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.875
A little bit, eh?

14:04.875 --> 14:06.583
A little bit.
Yeah, a little bit.

14:06.583 --> 14:10.000
I knew it.
Bret shouldn't have
a girlfriend. I told him.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.917
Did he listen?
No.

14:11.917 --> 14:14.625
No.
He doesn't listen.

14:14.625 --> 14:17.625
I just hope we don't
have a Yoko Ono situation.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.041
Do you know
what I mean?
Yeah.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.667
Is she trying to
split up the band?

14:21.667 --> 14:24.625
She hasn't mentioned anything.
I don't think so-- she's nice.

14:24.625 --> 14:28.000
Is she an artist?
Don't know.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.417
Does she like, you know,
staying in bed a lot?

14:32.500 --> 14:33.959
I haven't
really noticed.

14:33.959 --> 14:35.708
What about peace?
Is she into peace?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.625
I don't know.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.166
Look
into that.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.291
Now, Stuart Vaughan was
the director here.

14:41.291 --> 14:44.125
Imagine that!
"Julius Caesar" in 1957.

14:44.125 --> 14:46.208
I mean, the whole place
would have been full.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.792
Come down and
touch it, Jemaine!

14:51.750 --> 14:53.708
( acoustic guitar plays )

14:53.708 --> 14:55.625
Hey, Bret,
is, um--

14:55.625 --> 14:58.542
Is Coco into art?

14:58.542 --> 15:01.750
Yeah. Why?

15:01.750 --> 15:04.208
Uh,
no reason.
Mmm.

15:07.417 --> 15:10.291

15:16.000 --> 15:18.875

15:25.583 --> 15:28.625
♪ Diggin'

15:31.000 --> 15:33.959
All I'm saying,
Bret, is it could bring
unnecessary tension

15:33.959 --> 15:35.417
to the band's dynamic.

15:35.417 --> 15:38.500
Like this pencil--
look.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.041
( snaps )
Ah!

15:40.041 --> 15:42.000
Jeez, that is a...

15:43.166 --> 15:46.166
That's it-- that's
your band. Broken.

15:46.166 --> 15:50.208
It happens to all
the best bands, all right?

15:50.208 --> 15:52.792
Girlfriends and music
just don't mix very well.

15:52.792 --> 15:54.667
Jemaine's nodding
in approval.

15:56.166 --> 15:57.834
By the way,
how is Coco?

15:57.834 --> 15:59.667
She's great.
We're really in love.
Yeah?

15:59.667 --> 16:02.000
It's-- Yeah,
it's awesome.
She seems really nice.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.917
Yeah,
she's amazing.
Yeah.

16:03.917 --> 16:06.500
Hold onto her.
Okay?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.708
It's a rare thing,
what you've got there.

16:09.708 --> 16:12.625
Coco: Hi, I'm not
disturbing
you guys, am I?

16:12.625 --> 16:14.417
Hey, Coco.
No, come in.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.125
We're very busy
at the moment actually.

16:16.125 --> 16:19.041
Oh, okay. I just
popped in to
bring you some lunch.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.875
Oh good.
Favoritism.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.750
Here's yours, Jemaine.
Thank you.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.750
You're welcome.
Murray.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.458
Thank you.
You're welcome.

16:26.458 --> 16:28.291
Bret.
Thanks, Coco.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.208
You didn't need to do that.
That's great.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.375
While I'm here,
I thought I would
show you this.

16:32.375 --> 16:36.542
Um, I had
some spare time
last night, and...

16:36.542 --> 16:39.375
I thought it might
be useful.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.708
Whoa,
that's awesome.

16:42.708 --> 16:45.458
Well, it's really arty.
Bret: It's cool.

16:45.458 --> 16:48.708
We've already got
a poster that I did.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.750
Oh, okay. Oh, that's--
that's all right.

16:51.750 --> 16:55.083
That's cool.
That's great,
it's-- it's better.

16:55.083 --> 16:59.083
Um, I just thought--
That's no problem.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.208
Um, well, I should
let you guys--

17:01.208 --> 17:02.875
I should go, let you
guys get on with it.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.917
No, you should stay,
you should stay.
Oh, no no no...

17:04.917 --> 17:06.208
Yeah, yeah.
I should go.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.583
You should stay.
I insist.

17:07.583 --> 17:10.000
Look, take a seat.
You've brought us lunch.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.041
All right, we'll only be
five minutes, all right?

17:12.041 --> 17:13.917
At least.
Yeah, sit down,
sit down.

17:13.917 --> 17:15.417
Okay, okay, okay.

17:15.417 --> 17:17.333
Okay.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.583
Right,
"Slight delay...

17:22.291 --> 17:24.792
and also present,
Coco."

17:24.792 --> 17:26.458
( coughing )
Yoko.

17:26.458 --> 17:28.125
What did you--
what did you say?

17:28.125 --> 17:29.750
Oh nothing, just had
a bit of a cough.

17:29.750 --> 17:30.959
Mmm, okay.

17:30.959 --> 17:33.083
No, it wasn't
a real cough.
I said "Yoko."

17:33.083 --> 17:35.250
Yeah, I thought so.
Oh, I should go.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.917
Why did you say that?
'cause she's nothing
like Yoko.

17:37.917 --> 17:39.458
Oh-no, she isn't.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.834
Jemaine, you're putting
"oh no" together to
sound like "Ono."

17:41.834 --> 17:43.208
Oh-no, I didn't.
You did it again.

17:43.208 --> 17:44.750
Oh-no, did I?
Did you pick that up?

17:44.750 --> 17:46.625
He's doing it!
All right, I'm gonna go.

17:46.625 --> 17:49.291
Yeah. I'll throw
this sandwich in your
face if you say that again.

17:49.291 --> 17:51.375
Bret, don't you dare.
Not in my office.

17:51.375 --> 17:54.333
Coco, sit down.
Let's resolve this.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.166
Jemaine,
what's the problem?

17:56.166 --> 17:59.375
Well, Yoko's trying
to split up the band.

17:59.375 --> 18:00.875
Bret?
Jemaine's upset

18:00.875 --> 18:02.917
because I asked him not
to come on our dates

18:02.917 --> 18:05.667
and he's misinterpreting
his feelings about being
left out of the friendship

18:05.667 --> 18:07.500
as being about the band.
Oh, as if.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.083
It's the one I said
about Yoko trying
to split up the band.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.500
Sorry, guys, I just realized
I'm late for work.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.708
Um, it was
really cool seeing you.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.500
What are you working on?
Splitting up another band?

18:16.500 --> 18:19.041
Murray: Oh!  Here!
A sandwich hit my face.

18:19.041 --> 18:21.375
Murray: Bret!
Yeah well, I said I'd throw
a sandwich at your face.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.834
I've never seen
such bad behavior
at one of my meetings!

18:23.834 --> 18:26.667
Don't be such a--
a dickhead!
Yeah well,
I'm quitting this band.

18:26.667 --> 18:30.250
Well, you quit
last week.
Yeah well, I'm quitting again.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.542
Don't be a quitter!
You can't!

18:31.542 --> 18:33.250
Murray: Right, well,
go on then.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.000
You've never been interested
in bands anyway, Bret.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
You only came to one
of the band rotunda tours.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.375
Yeah, I'll see you later,
dickheads.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.542
Murray:
You're the dickhead,
Bret!

18:40.542 --> 18:42.625
Sorry, everyone.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.583
It was a visa
application denied.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.041
It took a long time
to try and get resolved.

18:47.041 --> 18:49.542
I think the guy's
a criminal.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.375
Sorry.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.125
Just carry on.

18:53.125 --> 18:55.250
It's looking good.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.542
Good riddance,
eh, Jemaine?

18:58.542 --> 19:01.041
I've got tomato
on my sleeve.

19:01.041 --> 19:02.333
See? I told you.

19:02.333 --> 19:05.417
Girlfriends and bands
just don't mix, Jemaine.

19:05.417 --> 19:08.375
You'll never have
a girlfriend, will you?

19:08.375 --> 19:09.708
No.

19:09.708 --> 19:12.166
All right, let's just
move on. Item two:

19:12.166 --> 19:13.750
band uniforms.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.542
I want all the band
to wear the same unif--

19:16.542 --> 19:18.542
Oh, that's...

19:19.417 --> 19:21.208
( exhales )

19:21.208 --> 19:22.542
Do you miss Bret?

19:22.542 --> 19:24.250
A little bit.
Do you?

19:24.250 --> 19:26.208
Same. I miss him.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.583
Can you ask him
back in the band?

19:32.083 --> 19:34.291
Okay.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.583
Bret?

19:42.583 --> 19:44.291
Bret?

19:51.458 --> 19:54.625
Bret's voice:
Dear Jemaine, by the time
you read this,

19:54.625 --> 19:57.750
I will be far far away
at Coco's house

19:57.750 --> 20:00.083
and I will no longer

You didn't seem to
understand that...

20:07.750 --> 20:10.458

thing for me to say is that...

20:11.542 --> 20:14.250
Do you remember
the time that seagull...

20:14.250 --> 20:17.750
