00:34.041 --> 00:37.625
- Thirty five.

00:42.893 --> 00:43.893
- Hello.

00:43.917 --> 00:46.291
You must be Mrs. McCutcheon.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.542
Your mum has told
me all about you.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.643
Just in case.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.166
- Mum.

01:09.709 --> 01:11.375
- Come on.

01:13.875 --> 01:14.875
Go on.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.935
Class, I'd like you all
to say good morning

01:22.959 --> 01:24.935
to Mrs. McCutcheon.

01:24.959 --> 01:28.601
- Good morning Mrs. McCutcheon.

01:28.625 --> 01:29.625
- Quiet.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.851
- Good morning.

01:33.875 --> 01:37.893
- Mrs. McCutcheon comes to us
all the way from Wagga Wagga.

01:37.917 --> 01:40.226
Now who knows what
state that's in?

01:40.250 --> 01:41.393
Flossy Jenkins?

01:41.417 --> 01:43.166
- New South Wales.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.226
- Very good, Flossy Jenkins.

01:47.250 --> 01:50.017
Class, I want you to make Mrs.
McCutcheon feel welcome

01:50.041 --> 01:52.601
and I wanna make sure we all

01:52.625 --> 01:53.905
make a lot of new friends today.

01:53.929 --> 01:57.804
Why don't you take a seat just
down there next to Trevor.

01:59.875 --> 02:01.267
Lovely.

02:01.291 --> 02:04.059
Now I'm sure you're all
aware of what's happening

02:04.083 --> 02:07.309
this Friday night, yes?

02:07.333 --> 02:09.267
The school dance.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.601
Very exciting.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.434
Tomorrow, we are gonna be having

02:12.458 --> 02:14.518
our very first dance lesson

02:14.542 --> 02:18.685
so that you can all get
ready for the big day.

02:18.709 --> 02:22.643
So I want you all to make sure
that you have a partner, yes?

02:22.667 --> 02:25.792
Now, rump steak!

02:42.458 --> 02:45.810
- How come you're
wearing a dress?

02:45.834 --> 02:47.500
Are you a girl?

02:51.166 --> 02:54.083
Boys aren't supposed
to wear dresses.

02:56.166 --> 02:58.542
- They're just not, all right?

02:59.959 --> 03:02.333
- Freak!

03:07.875 --> 03:10.101
- That's Gavin.

03:10.125 --> 03:10.976
He almost did a
shit in his pants

03:11.000 --> 03:13.959
when I chucked a lizard on him.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.267
Oi Trev!

03:38.291 --> 03:39.476
I got your footy boots, love!

03:39.500 --> 03:41.750
- Good!

03:43.875 --> 03:45.542
- Here babe!

03:48.417 --> 03:50.208
Wanna come and watch practice?

03:51.625 --> 03:53.935
- New kid.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.542
- Yes, of course you can.

03:59.041 --> 04:01.142
- Hi, I'm Ange.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.393
- Hi, I'm Jen.
- Hi.

04:02.417 --> 04:04.017
- I just wanted
to say thank you.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.161
It's so great that Tom has
found a new friend already.

04:06.185 --> 04:09.226
He's had a few problems
at the last school.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.500
How come?

04:41.625 --> 04:43.000
- C'mon, you bastard!

04:53.667 --> 04:56.101
- Roll off, roll off.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.709
- Hey, look!

05:01.458 --> 05:02.667
- Good one, Trev!

05:08.291 --> 05:10.559
- You showed them real good!
- Thanks.

05:10.583 --> 05:13.434
Mum reckons they might give me a
scholarship into a high school,

05:13.458 --> 05:17.226
away from here, somewhere
I fit in better.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.530
- I don't really
fit in anywhere.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.434
Well, I like you.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.101
I think you look nice.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.559
- This is my house.

05:25.583 --> 05:26.917
See you tomorrow.

05:29.166 --> 05:31.393
- Mrs. McCutcheon.

05:31.417 --> 05:32.500
Um...

05:34.917 --> 05:38.267
Well...

05:38.291 --> 05:42.583
Uh, I was wondering if you're
going to the dance with anyone?

05:42.959 --> 05:44.226
Um...

05:44.250 --> 05:46.542
I was wondering, maybe...

05:48.875 --> 05:51.976
Maybe you would
wanna go with me?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
- All right.

05:55.417 --> 05:58.083
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.500
- See ya.
- See ya.

06:02.041 --> 06:04.476
- I'm going now.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.851
- All right.

06:06.875 --> 06:07.875
- Woo!

06:16.291 --> 06:19.518
- And, uh, one, two, three,

06:19.542 --> 06:22.017
two to the side,

06:22.041 --> 06:23.559
everybody travel.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.935
Two, three, to one, two, three,

06:26.959 --> 06:29.810
then we go back
to the beginning.

06:29.834 --> 06:33.643
One, two, three, that's
good, two, three.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.583
Very good, Mrs.
McCutcheon and Trevor.

06:49.458 --> 06:52.059
- Hey, hey!

06:52.083 --> 06:52.893
Oi! Oi! No!

06:52.917 --> 06:55.935
Fight, fight, fight!

06:55.959 --> 07:00.083
- Oi! Oi! Tom!

07:06.000 --> 07:07.083
- Tom.

07:12.583 --> 07:17.434
- And remember Trevor,
any more shenanigans

07:17.458 --> 07:19.518
and you're off the team.

07:19.542 --> 07:22.542
- Yes, thank you. We heard
you the first time.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.267
You really need to
start thinking about

07:42.291 --> 07:44.768
the company you keep.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.875
What's wrong with Trevor?

07:49.125 --> 07:50.601
- On another note,

07:50.625 --> 07:51.935
I think it's time

07:51.959 --> 07:54.434
- that Tom...
- It's Mrs. McCutcheon!

07:54.458 --> 07:56.267
- Tom.
- Mrs. McCutcheon!

07:56.291 --> 07:59.267
- Started dressing
like the other boys.

07:59.291 --> 08:03.101
All of this could
have been avoided

08:03.125 --> 08:06.768
if he'd just tried
to fit in a bit.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.750
If you know what I mean.

08:16.709 --> 08:20.017
- There is one more
school in the area, Tom.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.201
I can call them in the morning
and see if they have got

08:22.225 --> 08:24.810
a place for you, or...

08:24.834 --> 08:26.309
you can stop wearing
your dress...

08:26.333 --> 08:28.101
- No!
- And you can stay at Roslyn Primary,

08:28.125 --> 08:29.834
it's up to you.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.017
- Tom!

08:39.041 --> 08:41.000
- What!

08:43.000 --> 08:44.959
- You're still Mrs. McCutcheon.

09:17.375 --> 09:21.309
Hello? - Hi Mum.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.125
It's me.

09:24.166 --> 09:26.375
It's Tom.

09:31.375 --> 09:33.851
- I want you to imagine this.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.851
Germany, Poland.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.351
Your room, your brother's room.

09:38.375 --> 09:40.518
Separate, yes?

09:40.542 --> 09:43.017
Not according to you, no.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.351
No, you'll just go straight
through into that room,

09:45.375 --> 09:47.935
even though he says "No,
don't come in here."

09:47.959 --> 09:50.893
You'll barge on through, in
the middle of the night,

09:50.917 --> 09:52.935
and then who does
that room belong to?

09:52.959 --> 09:54.893
- You.
- Correct.

09:54.917 --> 09:58.333
This is essentially what
Germany did to Poland.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.559
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.226
How come you're wearing that?

10:12.250 --> 10:14.559
You look weird.

10:14.583 --> 10:16.792
- They said I had to
dress like a boy.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.792
- I liked you how you were.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.959
Mrs. McCutcheon, wait!

10:29.959 --> 10:31.959
Are we still going to the dance?

10:38.959 --> 10:40.309
I'm not going!

10:40.333 --> 10:42.053
- Yes you are going.
- But I don't wanna go!

10:42.077 --> 10:43.726
- Look, I only took the shift

10:43.750 --> 10:45.810
because you said you
were going to the dance.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.208
- I hate what I'm wearing.

10:48.709 --> 10:49.750
He'll be waiting for you.

10:55.417 --> 10:58.917
Do you think some people are
born in the wrong body?

11:23.959 --> 11:25.476
I don't wanna go.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.726
- He doesn't hate you.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.059
- Yes he does!

11:29.083 --> 11:32.351
- Trevor does not
care what you wear.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.476
You are still you.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.083
- I'm not going in.

11:37.917 --> 11:39.000
- Tom, please.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.917
I need you to do this.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.083
For me.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.000
Mrs. McCutcheon?

11:57.375 --> 11:59.291
Just in case.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.959
- You look deadly, hey.

13:06.959 --> 13:09.500
- Nice frock, freak.

13:16.709 --> 13:19.142
- Hey.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.000
This here is my skin.

13:24.834 --> 13:27.959
And this here is your skin.
