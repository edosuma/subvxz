WEBVTT

00:20.654 --> 00:23.255
Car is ready,
Ambassador.
Thank you.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.657
Let's go.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.593
This is for the benefit
of the State Department.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.329
I get it. We'll finish
this conversation in Tunis.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.164
Okay. See you
in a week.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.799
(tires squealing)

00:33.801 --> 00:36.335
(rapid gunfire)

00:38.239 --> 00:39.104
(gasps)

00:39.106 --> 00:40.739
MAN:
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:40.741 --> 00:43.742
(indistinct shouting)

00:43.744 --> 00:46.478
(rapid gunfire)

00:46.480 --> 00:47.679
Get her out
through the back!

00:47.681 --> 00:49.081
I'll hold 'em off
as long as I can.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.082
Yes, sir.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.483
Ma'am, with me.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.318
Let's go.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.521
(gunfire continues)

00:56.690 --> 00:58.223
(grunts, woman screams)

01:01.128 --> 01:03.195
Go! Fall back!

01:03.197 --> 01:04.530
SOLDIER (in distance):
Fall back! Fall back!

01:26.253 --> 01:28.353
KENSI:
How bad is it?
We know about as much as you.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.788
ERIC: That's great,
'cause we know nothing.

01:29.790 --> 01:33.158
We need everyone
up in the...

01:33.160 --> 01:35.794
Okay... whew!

01:35.796 --> 01:37.229
GRANGER:
Glad you could make it.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.864
Two hours ago,

01:38.866 --> 01:42.167
the consulate in Sfax, Tunisia,
sent out a critical message

01:42.169 --> 01:44.536
that they were
under attack-- Jones.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.371
NSA found this
on Al Tunis Brigade's

01:46.373 --> 01:48.240
internal e-mail system,

01:48.242 --> 01:50.542
just 30 minutes
after the attack.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.478
ERIC:
We just downloaded this.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.680
I haven't had a chance
to analyze it yet.

01:54.682 --> 01:58.283
SAM: Who's that security
detail protecting?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.518
That's Ambassador Nancy Kelly.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.354
CALLEN:
And the officer next to her?

02:02.356 --> 02:03.522
Military attaché

02:03.524 --> 02:05.791
Tom Harris.
SAM:
Harris.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.327
He's a squared away sailor.
Good man.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.162
Ambassador Kelly and part
of her detail escaped

02:10.164 --> 02:11.830
through the back
of the compound

02:11.832 --> 02:14.366
and returned safely to
the embassy in Tunis.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.701
Unfortunately,

02:15.703 --> 02:17.236
local assets confirmed

02:17.238 --> 02:18.704
that two American lives
were lost.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.472
HETTY:
I'm sorry, Sam.

02:20.474 --> 02:24.276
Commander Harris
and one of the ambassador's

02:24.278 --> 02:28.914
security detail, a Mr. Clayton
Waters, did not survive

02:28.916 --> 02:31.416
the attack.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.752
Any security footage from
inside the consulate building?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.621
ERIC:
That's a negative.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.723
They cut the power
during the attack.
GRANGER: We assume that

02:37.725 --> 02:39.858
Harris and Waters were shot
trying to buy time

02:39.860 --> 02:41.560
for the ambassador's escape.

02:41.562 --> 02:46.899
That sounds like Harris--
gun, rather than run.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.534
Since Attaché Harris was Navy,

02:48.536 --> 02:51.270
we'll join in the investigation
with the FBI.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.939
They'll be in the lead.
ERIC:
I'm conferencing in

02:53.941 --> 02:55.841
FBI Agent Brad Reese.
He's the ALAP

02:55.843 --> 02:57.476
for the U.S.
Embassy in Tunis.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.511
We're grateful to have your team
working with us.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.712
SAM:
Any intel

03:00.714 --> 03:02.714
or advance warning
that someone was gonna try

03:02.716 --> 03:03.916
to assassinate
Ambassador Kelly?

03:03.918 --> 03:05.817
Negative. The RSO runs
a tight ship here.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.319
We haven't seen anything

03:07.321 --> 03:08.820
that would point
to something like this.

03:08.822 --> 03:12.658
These images that I'm sending
you over right now were found

03:12.660 --> 03:14.459
on the dark side
of Al Tunis Brigade's Web site

03:14.461 --> 03:15.827
in the days prior to the attack.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.197
CALLEN: Yeah, typical
pre-attack surveillance.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.565
DEEKS:
Establishing patterns

03:19.567 --> 03:21.300
for the target.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.968
The State Department
and the FBI are both working

03:22.970 --> 03:24.803
on the assumption
that this was an assassination

03:24.805 --> 03:26.872
attempt on Ambassador Kelly.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.208
If they'd succeeded,
this would have been the seventh

03:29.210 --> 03:31.276
U.S. ambassador killed
by terrorists.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.515
Will you be heading back to the
consulate to process the scene?

03:36.517 --> 03:37.849
No, I'll be heading
back to the U.S.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.851
for a debrief tonight.
State says the area

03:39.853 --> 03:41.870
is still too dangerous.

03:41.871 --> 03:43.888
Could be weeks before it cools
down enough for agents to go in

03:43.891 --> 03:45.524
and process the crime scene.
CALLEN:
This has to be done now,

03:45.526 --> 03:46.825
or there's not gonna be
any evidence!

03:46.827 --> 03:48.393
We'll have another Benghazi
on our hands.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.963
No answers, just conspiracies.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.864
Well, the terrorists are
in complete control of the area.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.233
Which is something
I can't allow.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.534
Harris was a friend.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.402
I can't let this pass

03:57.404 --> 03:58.804
without answers.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.240
Can we send in military
to secure the area?

04:01.242 --> 04:03.442
The host government has made it
abundantly clear,

04:03.444 --> 04:05.777
any large footprint from
military or law enforcement

04:05.779 --> 04:07.846
will be considered
an illegal occupation.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.615
What about a small footprint?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.350
Navy could get
us in there

04:11.352 --> 04:13.819
off the books, under the radar.

04:13.821 --> 04:17.956
Well, if you can get in,
we do have equipment

04:17.958 --> 04:21.627
that will make your limited time
on target worthwhile.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.535
(sighs heavily)

04:30.537 --> 04:31.970
KENSI:
So what's the plan?

04:31.972 --> 04:34.706
Would you see
if Harris gave his commanders

04:34.708 --> 04:35.907
any intel
on terror threats?

04:35.909 --> 04:36.975
Wait. We're not
going with you?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.543
It's too dangerous
for a full team.

04:38.545 --> 04:39.978
We're gonna travel
light and fast.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.914
Besides, if anything goes bad,
it's better if it's just us.

04:42.916 --> 04:43.982
If anything
goes bad,

04:43.984 --> 04:45.350
it's better if
we're there to help.

04:45.352 --> 04:47.352
You guys go visit
Harris's commander.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.920
Let us know what you find.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.656
Come on. Who's gonna
have your back?
He is.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.858
He's got mine.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.028
Be safe.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.429
See you in a few days.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.332
See you.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.376
(knocking on door)
WOMAN: Captain Beck?

05:11.378 --> 05:12.544
The agents are
here to see you.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.779
Thank you.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.016
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.785
Harris was one of the best men

05:19.787 --> 05:20.886
I've had the privilege
of commanding.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.487
Have a seat.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.790
Thank you.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.093
How can I help you folks?

05:28.095 --> 05:30.862
What can you tell us about
Commander Harris's activities

05:30.864 --> 05:32.798
in Tunisia,
prior to the attack?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.400
Typical attaché work.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.736
Hosting dignitaries,
meet and greets,

05:37.738 --> 05:39.338
formal functions,
that sort of thing.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.906
He didn't mention anything
that would indicate

05:40.908 --> 05:42.541
that he was concerned

05:42.543 --> 05:45.077
about the ambassador's
well-being and safety?

05:45.079 --> 05:47.012
No. He would have reported back
to me on something like that.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.847
KENSI:
Are you aware of anything
unusual that may have

05:48.849 --> 05:50.716
been going on at the consulate?

05:50.718 --> 05:52.084
Like what?

05:52.086 --> 05:54.119
Something that may raise
the ire of terrorists

05:54.121 --> 05:56.421
looking to
justify an attack.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.123
Nothing can justify
what those savages did.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.827
That's not what
my partner meant.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.362
We simply want
to figure out

06:03.364 --> 06:05.430
why they decided to come after
the ambassador now.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.566
I have no idea.
How often

06:07.568 --> 06:09.501
did you communicate
with Commander Harris?

06:09.503 --> 06:13.538
By phone or e-mail,
pretty much weekly.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.608
Mostly small talk.
When's the last
time you saw him?

06:18.746 --> 06:20.746
When he was back in the States

06:20.748 --> 06:22.848
for a couple of weeks
last summer.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.850
Has he been back
to the U.S. since?

06:24.852 --> 06:26.051
No. He was

06:26.053 --> 06:27.119
about due for his next R&R.

06:27.121 --> 06:29.388
He gets two a year.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.891
Okay. Um...

06:32.893 --> 06:34.126
I think we're all done here.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.794
Thank you very much.
And, of course, feel free

06:35.796 --> 06:38.029
to call us if you think
of anything pertinent.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.632
KENSI:
Thanks.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.701
Off of the record,

06:42.703 --> 06:44.736
I'm tired of playing politics

06:44.738 --> 06:46.471
with those
who think assassinations

06:46.473 --> 06:49.541
and car bombs
are tools of diplomacy.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.076
I want you

06:51.078 --> 06:53.078
to find out who did this,

06:53.080 --> 06:55.847
and I want you to kill him.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.208
Good luck.
See you at the exfil.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.043
Copy that.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.697
SAM:
Government-issued BDUs,

07:45.699 --> 07:48.033
night vision goggles.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.836
Not your typical Jihadi kit.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.605
Yeah, scavenged
from the consulate attack.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.620
ERIC: We're up and running,
guys. You got the feed.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.126
CALLEN:
Eric, keep an eye on these boys.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.062
We got you covered.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.861
(speaking local language)

09:02.175 --> 09:03.842
Sam, status.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.611
We're headed
for the safe room now.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.647
(tapping keys)

09:15.856 --> 09:17.055
SAM:
Oh, man.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.223
ERIC:
What is it, Sam?

09:18.225 --> 09:19.724
Bodies are still
in the safe room.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.959
They haven't moved 'em.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.875
Door hinge is bent.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.305
Got to make sure
these guys get brought home.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.108
They will be.
But right now our mission is

10:10.110 --> 10:12.978
is to find evidence to bring
their killers to justice.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.857
Sam.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.926
LIDAR ready to scan.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.700
Turning LIDAR on.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.637
How do we know
if it's working?

10:38.639 --> 10:39.938
CALLEN:
Ow.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.840
It's working.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.877
Unfortunately,
we're not gonna be as stealth

10:45.879 --> 10:47.345
as we had wanted to be,

10:47.347 --> 10:49.881
not with these guys
wearing night vision goggles.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.950
They'll see the lasers
through the windows.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.052
Lucky if we have two minutes
on target.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.121
We're gonna need
more than that.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.064
Scanning the northwest corner
of the room.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.380
Something's up. Look.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.949
ERIC:
Guys, one of the guards

11:24.951 --> 11:27.185
just ran to the front gate
to alert the others.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.255
Looks like they're headed
your way.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.223
So much for having two minutes.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.958
Almost done.
This is my last corner.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.895
GRANGER: Callen, Sam,
you have to get out now.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.897
Come on, G, we got
to beat feet.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.899
Ten more seconds.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.268
HETTY:
Pull out, Mr. Callen.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.003
The terrorists are out
of our field of view.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.005
HETTY:
Pull out, Mr. Callen.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.406
That's an order.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.407
G, we got to roll.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.443
Three seconds is all I...

11:53.313 --> 11:54.012
Ah!

12:02.155 --> 12:05.023
NELL:
Callen? Sam?

12:05.025 --> 12:07.726
(gunfire stops)
HETTY:
Mr. Callen?

12:07.728 --> 12:09.194
(static over radio)

12:09.196 --> 12:12.130
CALLEN: We're out. Heading to
the exfil rally point.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.164
They're out.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.011
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
We aren't the highest priority

12:27.013 --> 12:29.347
at the DoD right now,
and satellites in the area

12:29.349 --> 12:31.883
are a little overtaxed.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.352
Excuses lead to abuses.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.855
Owen, please.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.124
Oh. There you are.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.859
You guys gave me
a heart attack.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.961
Almost gave you
a heart attack?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.095
Imagine that.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.097
What does not
kill us, only...

12:46.099 --> 12:47.966
Makes me want to kill you.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.801
We got
what we needed.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.936
That was our assignment.
Yeah, let's just hope

12:51.938 --> 12:53.004
you got what we needed.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.474
I'm uploading
the LIDAR data now.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.179
Use your wizardry
to make it work, Gandalf.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.115
FBI's moving their equipment
into the gym to help work

13:04.117 --> 13:06.084
the case.
Coincidentally,

13:06.086 --> 13:08.486
while you were waiting
for your exfil, several...

13:08.488 --> 13:10.522
suspected members
of the Al Tunis Brigade boarded

13:10.524 --> 13:13.057
an Air France flight to Paris,

13:13.059 --> 13:16.060
with a direct connection
to Mexico City.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.362
You contact FBI
and Homeland Security?

13:17.364 --> 13:19.798
Yes, and Border Patrol.
Now, we'll catch them

13:19.800 --> 13:21.800
if they cross through
a border cross point.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.268
But the problem is
they probably won't.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.070
They're more likely
to try and sneak in.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.405
What's up, boys?

13:27.407 --> 13:30.175
How's the, uh, honeymoon going?

13:30.177 --> 13:33.378
Really?
You two want to go there?

13:33.380 --> 13:34.813
Oh, no, not us two.
Keep me out of this.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.181
CALLEN:
You guys have any luck?

13:36.182 --> 13:37.548
Commander Harris's boss,
Captain Beck,

13:37.551 --> 13:40.018
said that Harris had
typical foreign services work,

13:40.020 --> 13:41.920
nothing exciting
or out of the ordinary.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.555
Eric, let me know
if you find anything.

13:43.557 --> 13:45.356
You know it.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.165
Welcome home,
Agent Reese.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.667
Thank you.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.168
DEEKS (Southern accent):
You buildin' a fort?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.070
3-D evidence
printers,

13:59.072 --> 14:01.172
capable of
reproducing evidence

14:01.174 --> 14:02.407
smaller than the
naked eye can detect.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.575
KENSI and DEEKS:
Wow.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.977
Can you build me
a Stretch Armstrong doll?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.612
What?
What?

14:07.614 --> 14:09.431
Ignore him.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.249
Was the data that Callen
and Sam collected adequate?

14:11.251 --> 14:12.550
Oh, couldn't have been better.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.085
Good.
Soon,

14:14.087 --> 14:15.987
this will all be
an exact replica

14:15.989 --> 14:20.191
of the U.S. Consulate safe room,
down to the most minute detail.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.326
And then, after that,
you can build me

14:21.328 --> 14:22.994
a Stretch Armstrong doll?

14:22.996 --> 14:24.128
I'm just kidding.
What I really need

14:24.130 --> 14:25.663
is, like,
a-a Hetty bobblehead doll.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.197
Oh, my gosh. Would you stop?
What? I'm just saying.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.466
We could put it on
the dashboard...
Hey, guys?

14:28.468 --> 14:31.603
Hey.
We found something.
Captain Beck

14:31.605 --> 14:33.605
told you he hadn't seen
Commander Harris

14:33.607 --> 14:35.640
since he returned home
last summer, right?

14:35.642 --> 14:37.375
Right.
Well,

14:37.376 --> 14:39.109
State Department records show
that Beck traveled back

14:39.112 --> 14:41.246
from a two-week trip
to the consulate in Tunisia,

14:41.248 --> 14:43.114
just two days prior
to the attack.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.350
And consulate
security logs indicate

14:45.352 --> 14:47.185
that he spent
most of that time

14:47.187 --> 14:49.153
in closed-door meetings
with Harris.

14:49.155 --> 14:52.490
Why would Beck lie to us about
paying a subordinate a visit?

14:52.492 --> 14:55.159
Maybe it's not the trip
that he's hiding.

14:55.161 --> 14:58.930
Maybe it's the subject
of those closed-door meetings.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.368
Maybe we have to pay
Captain Beck another visit.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.319
WOMAN: I'm sorry,
can I help you?
KENSI: No, we do not need help.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.454
Thank you.
I'm sorry, sir. I don't...

15:23.456 --> 15:26.257
Please hold my calls,
Ms. Tucker.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.128
I have nothing to add
to what I've already told you.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.530
Captain, you know
it's a federal offense

15:32.532 --> 15:34.599
to make false statements
in a federal investigation.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.567
I did not make...
Sir, it would
behoove you

15:36.569 --> 15:39.604
not to compound your prior lack
of candor with more lies.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.506
We know you lied about
the last time you saw Harris.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.425
DEEKS: And you
so conveniently forgot

15:43.426 --> 15:45.343
to mention the fact that you
recently visited him in Tunisia.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.312
My interactions

15:47.313 --> 15:49.280
with my subordinates
have nothing to do

15:49.282 --> 15:51.416
with your investigations.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.284
Besides,

15:53.286 --> 15:55.320
it's well above your pay grade.
It may be above

15:55.322 --> 15:57.355
our pay grade, but it's not
above our security clearance.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.257
KENSI:
Captain,

15:59.259 --> 16:01.259
you knew Harris.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.261
He was a good man,

16:03.263 --> 16:05.263
and he deserves to be laid
to rest properly.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.531
And so do

16:06.533 --> 16:08.550
his assailants.
I'm sorry.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.568
I'm afraid
I can't tell you anything else.
Captain, please...

16:10.570 --> 16:12.270
I'd appreciate it
if you would

16:12.272 --> 16:13.705
just leave my office, please.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.308
Sir.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.347
(machine whirring)

16:24.384 --> 16:26.451
Whoa.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.532
Is it just me
or is this a little freaky?

16:43.236 --> 16:44.769
It's weird.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.238
Yeah. Tell me about it.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.640
No, no. Check it out.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.315
What's missing here?

17:01.788 --> 17:04.188
(phone ringing)

17:04.190 --> 17:06.057
KENSI:
The hell is he hiding?

17:06.059 --> 17:07.725
DEEKS:
I don't know.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.260
I know
what he's hiding behind.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.129
Hey, Callen,
you guys back yet?

17:11.131 --> 17:13.064
Yeah. Hey, look,
we got a problem over here.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.133
We're looking
at the 3-D recreation.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.702
There's no visible entrance
or exit wounds.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.738
Don't forget we can't see
the underside of the bodies.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.073
The entrance wound
could be underneath them,

17:22.075 --> 17:24.075
and there may not be
an exit wound.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.743
SAM:
Yeah, but there's no signs
of blood pooling either,

17:25.745 --> 17:28.279
and their body positioning
indicates...

17:28.281 --> 17:30.181
they died of smoke inhalation.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.649
There's no
blunt trauma.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.116
Either way, we have
a very different scenario.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.218
Why don't you guys head back.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.087
All right.
Well,

17:36.089 --> 17:37.288
we'll see you in 20 minutes.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.158
Callen and Sam think
they found something.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.226
Blue Chevy Malibu,
your 12 o'clock.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.328
Holding four guys.
Now there's three. One of them

17:44.330 --> 17:46.631
is now at your two o'clock
with a gray sport coat.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.633
You see him?

17:48.635 --> 17:49.634
I do.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.169
Okay, now we got one guy pulling

17:51.171 --> 17:52.770
a briefcase out
of the back of that car.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.241
Might be private security.

17:58.144 --> 18:00.211
Either way, I don't like it.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.746
You got my back?
Always.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.716
Ow.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.318
Gun! Federal agents.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.220
Stop! Freeze! Freeze!

18:16.262 --> 18:18.262
(engine revs, tires screech)

18:22.735 --> 18:25.236
(tires screeching)

18:26.372 --> 18:28.606
KENSI: Eric, I need you
to find a blue Chevy Malibu

18:28.608 --> 18:30.508
north on Flower.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.510
Got it, Kens.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.212
You okay?

18:34.214 --> 18:36.547
Yeah. Better than that guy.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.455
Tunisian government
negotiated the release

18:44.457 --> 18:46.457
of Waters'
and Harris's bodies.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.159
They're on their way home.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.160
Good.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.562
Leave no man behind.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.866
Guys, Kensi and Deeks
were just in a shooting

18:54.868 --> 18:56.267
outside Beck's office.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.535
Where are they?
ERIC:
Heading back.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.303
They're okay. They took out
one of the shooters,

18:59.305 --> 19:00.438
still trying to find the rest.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.806
What the hell happened?
We're...

19:01.808 --> 19:03.541
putting the pieces together now.
But check it.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.177
Going over the video again,
we found this.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.514
They're carrying RPGs.
If you've got rockets

19:09.516 --> 19:11.249
and your intent is to
kill the ambassador,

19:11.251 --> 19:12.917
why would you let her
go into a secure building?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.219
ERIC:
But wait, there's more.
Act now

19:15.221 --> 19:17.755
and we'll throw in this,
compliments of the FBI,

19:17.757 --> 19:19.924
taken in Koreatown
this morning.

19:19.926 --> 19:22.727
NELL:
The Feds have this bank
under surveillance because

19:22.729 --> 19:24.595
of suspected ties
to terror financing.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.197
But that's not all.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.865
This limited time offer
also gets you this guy.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.201
That's right. It's the shooter

19:30.203 --> 19:33.504
that Kensi and Deeks just killed
outside of Beck's office.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.373
GRANGER:
Same guy.
I think you just confirmed

19:35.375 --> 19:37.542
the bank's ties
to terror financing.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.211
Now, the angle of their faces
in relationship to the camera

19:40.213 --> 19:42.880
isn't ideal,
but facial recognition gives

19:42.882 --> 19:45.216
60% probability
that at least two of the men

19:45.218 --> 19:47.718
are the same men
from the consulate attack video.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.554
GRANGER:
Get these photos
out in a BOLO

19:49.556 --> 19:51.289
to all law enforcement
in the area

19:51.291 --> 19:53.357
with a warning
not to approach,

19:53.359 --> 19:56.694
just to notify NCIS and FBI
if they're spotted.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.629
On it.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.200
Gentlemen,
I've just been informed

20:02.202 --> 20:03.201
that Ambassador Kelly

20:03.203 --> 20:04.735
would like to see

20:04.737 --> 20:05.870
our replica

20:05.872 --> 20:07.405
of the consulate crime scene.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.674
The ambassador is here in L.A.?

20:09.676 --> 20:13.277
Well, she's here
for Commander Harris's burial,

20:13.279 --> 20:14.445
day after tomorrow,

20:14.447 --> 20:16.681
at Los Angeles
National Cemetery.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.350
SAM:
That's why these
guys are in L.A.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.452
They're here for another
attempt at the ambassador.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.332
No bullet holes in the walls,

20:34.334 --> 20:36.667
bodies or floor.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.835
Really bad shooting.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.770
Most of these guys
just pray and spray.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.573
There's a pretty clear
boot print here.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.946
Yeah, looks like the breacher
has some weight to him;

20:48.948 --> 20:52.550
this would be about a size 13.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.485
Take a picture, see if

20:54.487 --> 20:55.920
Eric and Nell
can find something.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.288
DEEKS:
What's up, gentlemen?

20:57.290 --> 20:58.623
You guys good?
DEEKS:
Peachy.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.458
What's the status
on the ambassador?

21:00.460 --> 21:01.910
CALLEN:
We alerted her security detail,

21:01.911 --> 21:03.361
as well as
the local authorities.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.428
REESE:
The FBI's all over it

21:04.430 --> 21:05.730
as well.
KENSI:
Question is,

21:05.732 --> 21:07.398
why were those guys at
Captain Beck's office?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.467
And, uh, was that
money for him?

21:09.469 --> 21:11.502
Well, he's gotta know
something went down,

21:11.504 --> 21:13.037
because of the shooting.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.472
No, we told him
it was drug related,

21:14.474 --> 21:15.506
so that should buy us some time.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.341
KENSI:
Yeah.
ERIC:
Oh, man!

21:17.343 --> 21:19.443
This is like the world's
greatest Lego set.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.313
Do you have any idea
what I could do with this?

21:22.315 --> 21:23.347
Eric, do you have
something for us?

21:23.349 --> 21:25.049
Oh, yes, sir.

21:25.051 --> 21:28.486
I have something that you're
going to like very, very much.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.921
NELL: Turns out
our evasive Captain Beck

21:30.923 --> 21:33.357
has some mysterious contacts.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.960
So we did a little backtracking

21:35.962 --> 21:38.396
and we located security camera
footage of Beck

21:38.398 --> 21:41.732
in the parking garage
of his Navy office,

21:41.734 --> 21:43.834
in the alleyway

21:43.836 --> 21:45.903
behind a coffee shop
in Beverly Hills...

21:45.905 --> 21:49.407
and on the lowest level of a
parking garage in Santa Monica.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.641
ERIC:
We've tracked much

21:50.643 --> 21:52.343
of Beck's recent
local movements,

21:52.345 --> 21:55.579
and he only meets this
individual in secluded spots.

21:55.581 --> 21:56.747
Hmm. Super Secret
Squirrel stuff.

21:56.749 --> 21:57.748
CALLEN:
Go back to the photo

21:57.750 --> 21:58.749
in the alley.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.785
Can you get in
any tighter?

22:02.922 --> 22:04.555
Huh.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.589
That's CIA.

22:05.591 --> 22:09.327
I worked with him in Russia.
'97.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.095
Went by the name of Otto.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.096
Otto?

22:12.098 --> 22:13.998
Well, it was in Moscow.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.434
I worked with him again,
two years later, in Caracas,

22:16.436 --> 22:17.601
and he was going
by the name Steve.

22:17.603 --> 22:20.604
Sounds like the CIA.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.440
Would you be able to locate him?

22:22.442 --> 22:24.642
I could pull a few strings.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.944
DEEKS:
<i> Wow.</i>

22:26.946 --> 22:30.481
Now I know how Mr. Magoo felt.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.416
Who?

22:32.418 --> 22:34.118
Magoo.
Seriously?

22:34.120 --> 22:35.853
"Oh-ho-ho, Magoo!

22:35.855 --> 22:37.888
You've done it again!"

22:37.890 --> 22:39.357
What?!

22:39.359 --> 22:40.458
DEEKS:
Seriously?

22:40.460 --> 22:41.592
Nothing?

22:41.594 --> 22:42.893
Whew! Wow.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.795
Obviously before your time.

22:44.797 --> 22:45.996
My time is your time,

22:45.998 --> 22:47.765
so how is that possible,
Einstein?

22:47.767 --> 22:49.567
Because you don't
have an appreciation

22:49.569 --> 22:50.968
for vintage animation.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.070
And if by that you mean
I don't like old cartoons,

22:53.072 --> 22:55.006
no, I don't.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.941
DEEKS:
First off, the word "cartoon"

22:56.943 --> 22:58.509
is demeaning to the art form.

22:58.511 --> 22:59.510
And secondly... (coughs)

22:59.512 --> 23:00.678
...cartoons are cool.
Oh, yeah?

23:00.679 --> 23:01.845
You think they're cool?
Yeah, I think
they're rad.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.381
How rad do you
think they are?

23:03.383 --> 23:04.582
I think they're awesome possum.

23:04.584 --> 23:05.716
How awesome possum?
REESE:
What is this?

23:05.718 --> 23:08.018
This? Oh, don't
worry about this.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.120
It's just adorable
partner banter.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.554
You're gonna come to love this.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.090
No, here.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.831
DEEKS:
Oh, wow.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.567
Looks like you invited him
to dinner at your house,

23:23.569 --> 23:25.169
because there is
human bite marks

23:25.171 --> 23:26.704
on that piece
of paper.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.542
KENSI:
There are also marks that
look like writing indentations.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.411
DEEKS: Well, let's get Eric
to see what it says.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.680
CALLEN: Partial document
in Harris's hand.

23:38.818 --> 23:42.686
Looks like one word
stands out-- "Dogleg."

23:43.756 --> 23:45.489
Sounds like a codename.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.192
Let's see if the CIA
can shed some light on it.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.731
Let me handle this guy.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.767
Hey, buddy,
how the hell are you?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.436
Good.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.603
This is my partner,

23:59.605 --> 24:00.604
Huggy.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.605
Walter.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.507
Pleasure to meet
you, Huggy.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.142
Well, it's been a while.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.844
What can I do you for?
Well, I got a couple

24:06.846 --> 24:08.846
questions I think you might
be able to help us with, Wally.

24:08.848 --> 24:12.983
Uh, you know I hate,
uh, "Wally," Butch.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.952
Come on. Yeah.
Show some respect, Butch.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.787
I'm sor... I'm sorry.
It-it slipped my mind.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.523
What can you tell us
about Dogleg?

24:19.525 --> 24:20.758
Nothing.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.027
I'm not much of a golfer.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.595
Uh-huh.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.864
CALLEN:
I get it.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.666
But two good men
died in Tunisia

24:28.668 --> 24:29.900
and I know you got information

24:29.902 --> 24:31.469
that could help us
find the killers.

24:31.471 --> 24:34.205
Sorry, but you're barking up
the wrong flagpole.

24:34.207 --> 24:35.840
CALLEN:
Walter,

24:35.842 --> 24:37.107
we got another

24:37.109 --> 24:38.843
Benghazi here.

24:38.845 --> 24:39.844
Never been to Tunisia.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.712
Or Benghazi. Sorry.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.714
Is that it?
No, that's not it.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.182
A friend of mine died
while trying to eat

24:45.184 --> 24:46.817
a document that
referred to Dogleg,

24:46.819 --> 24:48.953
so I'd appreciate
some genuine cooperation.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.821
SAM:
Don't look at him,

24:50.823 --> 24:51.889
look at me.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.557
I believe he was

24:53.559 --> 24:55.759
trying to protect
whatever Dogleg is.

24:55.761 --> 24:57.728
I want to know
what was so important

24:57.730 --> 24:59.930
that he was trying
to protect it and not himself.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.135
I shouldn't tell you anything.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.570
G?

25:06.572 --> 25:07.938
Relax, Hugs.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.874
I didn't say I wouldn't,
I said I shouldn't.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.142
Now, I'm only gonna
point you in a direction;

25:12.144 --> 25:13.811
the rest is up to you
to figure out.

25:13.813 --> 25:17.581
DOGLEG is the code name
of a top secret

25:17.583 --> 25:19.650
black op in Tunisia.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.619
I oversaw it for the CIA.

25:21.621 --> 25:22.987
Doing what?

25:22.989 --> 25:25.089
There's a lot of
good undercover people

25:25.091 --> 25:26.257
on the ground there.

25:26.259 --> 25:27.758
Answer the question.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.059
Look, I warned them

25:29.061 --> 25:30.761
it'd piss off the natives.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.162
Like I said,

25:32.164 --> 25:33.697
you want to find out more,

25:33.699 --> 25:35.766
you're gonna have to do it
on your own, gents.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.001
Hey...

25:37.003 --> 25:39.270
and keep your heads down.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.639
You're just gonna
let him walk away?

25:41.641 --> 25:43.707
I can't exactly
hold him here, Hugs.

25:50.283 --> 25:53.617
Where the hell he go?

25:53.619 --> 25:55.686
That's why they
call 'em spooks.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.595
Don't you ever get sick
of drinking that stuff?

26:06.132 --> 26:08.299
You probably have enough tannins
in your system

26:08.301 --> 26:10.568
to turn you into
a suede handbag.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.273
Do you actually have
anything on your mind,

26:16.275 --> 26:17.708
Assistant Director?

26:17.710 --> 26:21.045
Or are you just looking
for a kitten to kick?

26:24.283 --> 26:27.117
Are you comfortable
bringing the ambassador here?

26:27.119 --> 26:29.286
I am.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.121
Hasn't been
the safest place lately.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.923
And we still

26:32.925 --> 26:35.159
don't know who our mole
was working for.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.794
Then this should be a good test

26:36.796 --> 26:38.329
of our security.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.137
So we got nothing
on your friend Otto.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.272
He, like, disappeared.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.873
But we do have this,

26:49.875 --> 26:52.109
from the consulate's
outer security cameras

26:52.111 --> 26:53.377
prior to the attack.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.617
I don't see anything.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.253
Oh, uh, um...

27:03.255 --> 27:05.889
just bear-bear with me.

27:05.891 --> 27:06.890
Hold on...

27:06.892 --> 27:08.192
Bu-bu-bu-bu...

27:08.194 --> 27:11.328
Maybe you should just
tell us what it was.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.364
ERIC:
Uh... y... I-I could,

27:13.366 --> 27:15.299
but it would...
it's more of like a visual.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.668
Things would just...
just hang tight.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.739
Why don't you text us
when you find it?

27:21.740 --> 27:23.240
No, no, wait! I got it,
I got it, I got it.

27:25.011 --> 27:28.112
Ambassador Kelly
and Commander Harris.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.347
Trouble in paradise?

27:30.349 --> 27:33.817
(phone buzzing)
Maybe Kensi can
read her lips.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.156
SAM: It's gonna have to wait.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.759
Ambassador's rolling up.

27:44.897 --> 27:49.733
Madame Ambassador,
right this way.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.236
And we'll come in here.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.904
This is the 3D render

27:53.906 --> 27:56.440
of the crime scene.

28:10.823 --> 28:15.059
This is FBI
Special Agent Reese...

28:15.061 --> 28:16.694
REESE:
Ma'am.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.328
HETTY:
...and LAPD Detective Deeks...

28:18.330 --> 28:19.830
Ambassador.

28:19.831 --> 28:21.331
HETTY: ...and NCIS
Special Agents Blye...

28:21.333 --> 28:23.434
Hi.
...Callen, and Hanna.

28:23.436 --> 28:25.035
Ma'am.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.770
SAM:
Madam.
You're the two

28:26.772 --> 28:28.105
who recovered all this evidence?

28:28.107 --> 28:29.373
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.408
Thank you.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.710
We'll find justice for them.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.378
KELLY:
They died so I could live.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.180
No one can ever
repay such a debt.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.314
CALLEN:
Ma'am, is it possible

28:37.316 --> 28:38.749
we could have
a moment of your time?

28:38.751 --> 28:39.416
Certainly.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.258
How can I be
of assistance?

28:48.260 --> 28:49.393
SAM: We have some
conflicting hypotheses

28:49.395 --> 28:50.794
about the terrorist attack,

28:50.796 --> 28:52.196
which we were hoping
you could help clarify.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.897
You can have a seat here.

28:53.899 --> 28:54.965
Thank you.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.308
The terrorists had RPGs,
yet they didn't use them.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.445
No bullet holes in the
walls or the bodies.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.115
It appears they died
of smoke inhalation

29:11.117 --> 29:13.117
because the terrorists
were trying to smoke 'em out.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.952
I don't understand.

29:14.954 --> 29:15.953
CALLEN:
Ma'am, we believe

29:15.955 --> 29:16.954
this might have been

29:16.956 --> 29:18.055
a kidnapping attempt,

29:18.057 --> 29:20.390
not an assassination
attempt.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.992
SAM:
These are from

29:21.994 --> 29:24.428
the terrorists'
internal communications.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.297
Not all these images are of me.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.866
How do you know
I was the target?

29:31.537 --> 29:32.436
CALLEN:
She's right.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.138
There are five people

29:34.140 --> 29:36.240
in all of these images.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.508
I've got you,

29:37.510 --> 29:40.310
personal assistant Lois,

29:40.312 --> 29:42.346
Harris, your driver,

29:42.348 --> 29:44.047
and the head of
your security detail, Ray.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.551
You ready?

29:47.553 --> 29:48.819
Go.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.555
CALLEN:
Harris, you, Lois, driver.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.492
Ray, Harris, you,

29:55.494 --> 29:57.327
Lois.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.428
Harris, Ray.

29:58.430 --> 30:01.465
You, Lois, Harris.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.201
Ray, you, Harris.

30:05.471 --> 30:09.173
Harris, Driver, Ray.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.841
What do we got, Sam?

30:13.813 --> 30:16.446
Harris is
the common denominator.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.282
He's in all of
these images.

30:20.119 --> 30:23.453
Meaning the terrorists
were trying

30:23.455 --> 30:25.189
to kidnap Harris.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.491
Not you.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.493
Do you have any idea why?

30:29.495 --> 30:31.862
No.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.964
But you might.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.472
If I had to guess,

30:42.474 --> 30:45.609
I would say that
that argument is

30:45.611 --> 30:47.878
about Dogleg.

30:48.948 --> 30:52.583
Am I right?

30:52.585 --> 30:55.219
I was arguing with Harris
about the Dogleg op

30:55.221 --> 30:56.954
he was running
out of the consulate.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.121
SAM:
We need to know everything

30:58.123 --> 30:59.623
about this op.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.892
It involves dozens
of covert operatives

31:01.894 --> 31:03.894
throughout Tunisia.

31:03.896 --> 31:05.996
The kind of risky op that,
if it goes south,

31:05.998 --> 31:07.531
it's a career-ender.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.399
This op ended lives.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.468
So careers are not high priority

31:11.470 --> 31:14.238
for us right now.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.506
Who else was involved
with Dogleg?

31:16.508 --> 31:18.575
That's what I was mad
at Harris about.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.444
I wanted to know what other

31:20.446 --> 31:22.446
American personnel
were involved.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.047
I'm the ambassador.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.483
I'm responsible for every
American in that country.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.517
We appreciate that, ma'am.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.920
But can you give us

31:29.922 --> 31:31.455
the identity
of anyone else involved?

31:31.457 --> 31:33.156
Harris would not

31:33.158 --> 31:35.559
identify any
of the operatives in Tunisia,

31:35.561 --> 31:37.961
which is what got me so upset.

31:37.963 --> 31:41.031
He kept telling me I'd be safer
if I didn't know.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.033
What about outside of Tunisia?

31:43.035 --> 31:45.602
Do you know anyone that was
involved that wasn't in Tunisia?

31:45.604 --> 31:46.937
Only Harris's boss.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.405
Captain Beck.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.241
I believe he was
in charge of it.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.811
What is it?

31:53.812 --> 31:56.380
Your security detail may be
protecting the wrong person.

31:56.382 --> 31:58.115
If the terrorists
were after Harris

31:58.117 --> 31:59.983
in Tunisia and that failed...

31:59.985 --> 32:01.985
They're probably in L.A.
to get Captain Beck.

32:01.987 --> 32:05.022
Not you, Ambassador.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.566
Eric, get Kensi and Deeks over

32:16.568 --> 32:18.936
to Captain Beck's house
immediately.

32:28.213 --> 32:31.181
Let's hope Beck is
smart enough to talk now.

32:34.219 --> 32:36.053
Deeks?
That's not good.

32:59.545 --> 33:00.744
Kens?
Yup.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.145
Anything?

33:02.147 --> 33:03.547
Nothing.

33:03.549 --> 33:06.249
Clear signs of forced entry
on the front door.

33:06.251 --> 33:07.484
Same as the back.
(line ringing)

33:07.486 --> 33:08.752
Wow, looks like your

33:08.754 --> 33:11.254
house<i> after</i> you clean it.
Thank you.

33:11.256 --> 33:12.489
Go for Beale.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.057
Eric, looks like
Beck was abducted.

33:14.059 --> 33:15.359
See if you can find
any footage in the area

33:15.361 --> 33:17.561
that'll give us
a direction of travel.
Got it.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.763
Come here.
You know if Beck talks,

33:19.765 --> 33:21.298
he's gonna compromise
the safety

33:21.300 --> 33:24.301
of a dozen U.S.
operatives overseas.

33:24.303 --> 33:25.769
Look familiar?

33:25.771 --> 33:27.270
Yeah, it looks like
the same size and tread

33:27.272 --> 33:28.338
as the boot we found
at the consulate.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.439
Yup.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.776
Eric, I'm sending you
a picture right now.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.012
Compare it to the bootprint

33:35.014 --> 33:36.213
that we found
at the consulate replica.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.647
Got it.
I'll start scouring databases.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.383
Thank you.

33:41.086 --> 33:43.086
Hey, you were right.
Bootprints were a match.

33:43.088 --> 33:44.755
Ah, great! So, we're looking
for a guy in boots.

33:44.757 --> 33:46.390
Just to clarify--
we can eliminate anybody wearing

33:46.392 --> 33:48.225
flip flops or clogs?

33:48.227 --> 33:49.793
Mockery aside-- you're right.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.495
The boots were
a very common brand name

33:51.497 --> 33:53.130
so they weren't
much help on their own.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.297
DEEKS:
Well, Mockery is

33:54.299 --> 33:56.233
my middle name.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.567
When we combine the boot
brand, the foot size,

33:57.569 --> 33:59.736
the satellite images of
the consulate aftermath,

33:59.738 --> 34:01.571
the terrorist videos

34:01.573 --> 34:03.573
and our own files from
the Al Tunis Brigade...

34:03.575 --> 34:05.442
Ladies and gentlemen,
we present to you

34:05.444 --> 34:08.378
the Cinderella
for our glass boot--

34:08.380 --> 34:11.114
Tunisia's own Munir al Zarzi.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.251
CALLEN:
I assume from his nom de guerre

34:14.253 --> 34:15.385
that he's from Zarzis?

34:15.387 --> 34:17.220
Coastal town in Tunisia?

34:17.222 --> 34:20.157
Yes. He was captured
in Afghanistan in 2002.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.559
He did seven years in Gitmo
and was released in 2010.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.294
He's not your typical

34:24.296 --> 34:25.295
weekend warrior.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.296
He's a true believer.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.732
A hardcore Jihadist.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.100
NELL:
He also oversaw

34:30.102 --> 34:33.136
the beheading
of 19 of his captives.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.171
Lovely.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.238
ERIC:
We did a Kaleidoscope search

34:35.240 --> 34:37.274
for Munir al Zarzi

34:37.276 --> 34:39.242
in the vicinity of the bank
from the FBI surveillance video,

34:39.244 --> 34:41.361
and found this.

34:41.362 --> 34:43.479
NELL:
This was a traffic camera
in Koreatown,

34:43.482 --> 34:45.248
less than a mile from the bank.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.250
ERIC:
We then tracked his car
to a compound in Hancock Park.

34:47.252 --> 34:50.220
Best guess-- he's still there.

34:50.222 --> 34:53.323
CALLEN: We're going
tactical now. Tell Hetty.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.459
Alert Agent Reese, and have
the FBI SWAT team spun up.

34:55.461 --> 34:57.527
Will do.
Got it.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.333
Alpha Team will approach
the main gate

35:03.335 --> 35:05.335
on the north side.
They'll be entering
a fatal funnel

35:05.337 --> 35:06.403
if they go through
that front gate.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.505
Terrorists will be
expecting that.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.173
Exactly. That's why
we need Alpha Team to make

35:10.175 --> 35:12.175
their presence known
outside the gate.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.177
We, Bravo Team, will approach
the south wall,

35:14.179 --> 35:15.796
Charlie Team

35:15.797 --> 35:17.414
will secure a third
breach point to the west.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.682
Do we have any intel

35:18.684 --> 35:21.184
on exactly where
the hostage is being held?

35:21.186 --> 35:22.519
Negative, but we're fairly
certain Captain Beck's

35:22.521 --> 35:24.187
being tortured for information.

35:24.189 --> 35:27.290
Timing is everything!
Everybody moves on our command!

35:27.292 --> 35:29.159
Reece here.
Alpha Team is in position.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.328
Kensi, Deeks, you ready?

35:31.329 --> 35:33.496
Affirmative. Charlie Team is
waiting on your green light.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.764
Charlie Team, hold.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.867
Bravo, hold. Alpha?

35:36.869 --> 35:38.368
On my count.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.370
Three, two, one.

35:40.372 --> 35:41.571
Execute!

35:41.573 --> 35:43.640
Execute! Execute!

36:04.429 --> 36:06.496
(men yelling)

36:15.841 --> 36:18.708
Bravo Team coming in.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.575
¶ ¶

37:00.419 --> 37:01.851
Drop your weapons.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.390
Okay, okay.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.425
Secure!

37:08.427 --> 37:09.659
REESE:
On your knees!

37:09.661 --> 37:11.928
SAM: Alpha Team,
secure the terrorists.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.530
CALLEN:
Got this, Reece?

37:13.532 --> 37:14.965
Got it. Go! Go!

37:14.967 --> 37:16.733
Charlie Team, Execute! Execute!

37:16.735 --> 37:18.802
Execute!

37:20.372 --> 37:22.339
Go.
Go! Go!

37:42.828 --> 37:44.461
Okay, yeah.

37:45.831 --> 37:46.963
(grunts)

37:55.274 --> 37:57.007
(man yells)

37:57.009 --> 37:58.975
You're welcome.

38:09.288 --> 38:12.055
Take it that's not a surrender?

38:14.593 --> 38:15.925
You are so very wrong!

38:15.927 --> 38:17.060
This will never come to an end!

38:17.062 --> 38:18.295
We are only just...

38:18.297 --> 38:19.663
Aah!

38:22.434 --> 38:25.602
Yeah, I thought about hitting an
eight, but then I decided just

38:25.604 --> 38:27.304
to, you know, choke down
to seven iron.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.074
Bet you're happy to see us now,
Captain Beck?

38:31.076 --> 38:32.776
I didn't tell them anything.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.411
I didn't say a word.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.779
We know.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.781
Could tell by your face
you kept your mouth shut.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.949
Good job, Captain.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.032
Agent Reese and his team
are leaving now.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.968
I just wanted to thank
you guys for everything.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.070
It's our pleasure.
Hey.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.604
We're happy we could help.

39:01.606 --> 39:02.872
Yeah.
DEEKS:
Hey, about that, uh,

39:02.874 --> 39:04.808
3D printer of yours...

39:04.810 --> 39:06.910
Already packed up
and out of your hair.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.978
Great, so that means I'm not
gonna get a Stretch Armstrong

39:08.980 --> 39:11.514
or a Hetty bobble head doll?

39:11.516 --> 39:12.649
What's wrong with you?

39:12.651 --> 39:14.751
Hmm?
He's a bobble head.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.420
Yeah, he's more like
a Ch-Ch-Chia pet.

39:17.422 --> 39:18.455
(Nell clears her throat)

39:18.457 --> 39:19.723
Guys...
It's okay.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.691
I'm not sure how, but this?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.093
This works.

39:23.095 --> 39:24.661
CALLEN: Yeah, well,
we're all just kind of

39:24.663 --> 39:27.831
one big happy, slightly
dysfunctional family.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.466
Yeah.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.401
Good night, Callen.

39:31.403 --> 39:33.703
Good night, Kensi.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.672
Good night, Nay-Nay.

39:35.674 --> 39:36.873
Good night, John Boy.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.041
