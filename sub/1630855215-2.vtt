WEBVTT

00:15.084 --> 00:17.431
With Tito and Mick out,
Orange County's gone.

00:17.569 --> 00:19.743
- Inland Empire.
- You got it.

00:19.881 --> 00:21.676
It's a solid bunch of brothers.
We'll hold it down.

00:21.814 --> 00:23.540
You're the last stand
between us and them.

00:23.678 --> 00:24.990
What do you know about me?

00:25.128 --> 00:26.233
You ex-military?

00:26.371 --> 00:28.200
- Blackwater?
- Close enough.

00:28.338 --> 00:31.065
We are unfuckable.

00:31.203 --> 00:33.861
Now, shall we begin...

00:34.965 --> 00:36.277
...the future?

00:45.562 --> 00:46.632
<i>It's time to come home.</i>

00:46.770 --> 00:48.910
For us to be a family again.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.844
Miguel, what did you do
to my sister?

00:51.982 --> 00:53.846
- Say hi to Mommy.
- Hi, Mommy.

00:53.984 --> 00:55.365
<i>[laughs] Yeah...</i>

00:55.503 --> 00:59.128
Everything you fucking said
is a fucking lie.

00:59.266 --> 01:01.026
It's just complicated.

01:01.164 --> 01:03.580
- Fuck this.
- We have you.

01:03.718 --> 01:06.066
So please, let me help you.

01:06.204 --> 01:07.929
I'm not a fucking rat.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.450
One of the brothers you're
trying to protect is a rat.

01:11.588 --> 01:12.900
I want you out.

01:14.246 --> 01:16.076
I'm happy.

01:16.214 --> 01:19.009
I won't be here to see it burn.

01:19.148 --> 01:20.804
- You with them?
- Who?

01:20.942 --> 01:23.152
- Iron War.
- Fuck Iron War.

01:23.290 --> 01:25.533
Bunch of cops and COs
playing one-percenter.

01:25.671 --> 01:26.948
You paying taxes now
to Iron War?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.778
They came here.

01:28.916 --> 01:30.469
Sister Anne made sure
one of them

01:30.607 --> 01:33.300
left grinning.

01:33.438 --> 01:34.956
You got something to say
to your boyfriend,

01:35.095 --> 01:38.132
you can hold onto his pocket
when I do your cavity search.

01:38.270 --> 01:41.480
Tell that Mayan rat
"Smokey says hello."

01:41.618 --> 01:43.310
Let's go. Let's go.

01:43.448 --> 01:45.450
Oh, shit.

03:45.570 --> 03:46.881
What do they know?

03:47.019 --> 03:48.883
I'm gonna go find out now.

03:50.851 --> 03:52.093
EZ.

03:54.095 --> 03:56.028
It's gonna be okay.

04:03.312 --> 04:05.175
I said goodbye and I was out.

04:05.314 --> 04:06.798
So it must have been
after I left.

04:06.936 --> 04:08.351
Did anything happen in visiting?

04:08.489 --> 04:10.491
Nothing. No trouble.

04:10.629 --> 04:12.804
Half of those COs
are Iron War.

04:12.942 --> 04:14.288
All right? This don't happen
without them knowing.

04:14.426 --> 04:17.326
What kind of shape's he in?

04:17.464 --> 04:18.603
I don't know.

04:18.741 --> 04:21.088
Just found out
from Sandoval's cousin.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.332
- Sandoval get hit, too?
- Nah.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.161
Said it happened too fast.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.922
- Bullshit.
- Well, he's PC'ed up now.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.615
Cousin heard
from Sandoval's girl.

04:30.753 --> 04:32.444
She called out of respect
to the club.

04:32.582 --> 04:34.688
So Creep's just standing alone

04:34.826 --> 04:36.621
in there now?

04:36.759 --> 04:39.313
Don't know how much longer
he'll be standing at all.

04:39.451 --> 04:41.004
He got hit pretty bad.

04:42.765 --> 04:44.387
What the fuck are we gonna do?

04:52.084 --> 04:53.776
I'm good alone with him.

04:53.914 --> 04:55.674
- You sure?
- Yeah.

04:55.812 --> 04:57.814
I got it. Thanks.

05:05.408 --> 05:07.307
Jesus.

05:12.242 --> 05:14.141
Get the fuck out.

05:22.460 --> 05:24.876
Let me...

05:25.014 --> 05:27.327
Let me put you
in protective custody.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.640
Fuck that.

05:30.778 --> 05:33.609
They'll have
to fucking kill me first.

05:40.685 --> 05:42.514
You know, I drive out.

05:45.621 --> 05:49.038
Park on the ridge road
by the gun tower.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.456
And I just sit there...

05:54.802 --> 05:58.496
...wondering which cell
is yours.

05:58.634 --> 06:01.084
What you're doing.

06:01.222 --> 06:04.433
- If you're safe.
- What the fuck is it that you,

06:04.571 --> 06:08.091
- that you want from me?
- What do I want from you?

06:08.229 --> 06:09.783
I don't know, how about
a fucking time machine

06:09.921 --> 06:12.544
so I can go back and never push
for this fucking assignment?

06:13.890 --> 06:16.548
I need you to know that
that picture of my ex,

06:16.686 --> 06:18.826
you remember that picture, it...
well, he wasn't just...

06:18.964 --> 06:21.415
I don't care for your lies.

06:21.553 --> 06:24.245
- This isn't a lie.
- I don't give a fuck.

06:27.283 --> 06:28.940
Yeah.

06:30.942 --> 06:33.531
Okay, um...

06:38.812 --> 06:41.780
He wasn't just my ex.

06:41.918 --> 06:43.920
He was my partner.

06:45.922 --> 06:47.614
The love of my life.

06:50.617 --> 06:52.860
And a gangbanger,

06:52.998 --> 06:56.519
a lowlife just like you,

06:56.657 --> 06:58.935
shot him in the face.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.596
I wasn't ready to come back.

07:06.633 --> 07:09.498
- I thought that I...
- I ain't a gangbanger.

07:09.636 --> 07:10.982
You...

07:11.120 --> 07:13.916
are a fucking criminal.

07:14.054 --> 07:15.780
A fucking scumbag.

07:15.918 --> 07:19.956
And that's how you honored
the love of your life?

07:20.094 --> 07:23.132
Spreading your legs
for a scumbag?

07:25.272 --> 07:28.724
You're a fucking lowlife.

07:28.862 --> 07:32.348
And I'm sure your man
had it coming.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.799
You are a fucking piece of shit,

07:34.937 --> 07:36.973
and I hope you fucking die
out there.

07:38.837 --> 07:41.495
Hey. Wait.

07:43.635 --> 07:46.466
I just...

07:56.786 --> 07:58.270
Please, Neron.

07:58.408 --> 08:00.652
Let me make one call.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.689
Help keep you safe.

08:02.827 --> 08:04.449
If you really want to help me...

08:06.658 --> 08:08.867
You said there was a rat.

08:09.972 --> 08:11.387
In Santo Padre.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.499
I need you to find out
who it is.

10:24.934 --> 10:26.695
Hey, boss, aren't you late
for your shift?

10:26.833 --> 10:28.800
Who we got on?

10:28.938 --> 10:32.355
Stick and Thompson on unit five.

10:32.493 --> 10:35.255
Rodriguez and Jones
on the floor with you.

10:35.393 --> 10:37.015
All right, fine.

10:37.153 --> 10:39.017
Any trouble with the paperwork
from last night?

10:39.155 --> 10:42.745
No. Sullivan and Rose
get a paid week off.

10:42.883 --> 10:45.299
Counseling for witnessing
a violent act.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.853
God bless Sacramento liberals.

11:07.943 --> 11:12.706
Oh, this is cute.
You guys playing dress-up?

11:12.844 --> 11:14.743
You supposed to be
the leader or something?

11:14.881 --> 11:17.055
Oh, shit.

11:17.193 --> 11:20.956
I didn't think the janitor crew
came on till the third shift.

11:21.094 --> 11:23.130
You cool with all
that racist shit?

11:23.268 --> 11:24.304
Oh, come on.

11:24.442 --> 11:26.547
Not every white guy's
a racist, JosÃ©.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.480
That's <i>your</i> shit
to work through.

11:28.618 --> 11:30.828
The only colors I see

11:30.966 --> 11:32.830
are black and blue.

11:32.968 --> 11:35.246
Is this supposed to be blue?

11:35.384 --> 11:38.042
This looks a little too,
uh, too sweet

11:38.180 --> 11:40.147
to be blue.

11:40.285 --> 11:41.942
More like a...

11:42.080 --> 11:43.564
- Violet.
- Ah, <i>mira.</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:46.740
- A tough fucking violet.
- Yeah.

11:46.878 --> 11:49.639
You let one of our brothers
get hit last night.

11:49.778 --> 11:53.333
Can't help if Mayans are nothing
but bottom-feeders these days.

11:54.783 --> 11:57.337
That motherfucker was there.

12:03.239 --> 12:04.516
You been out
to the Salton Sea lately?

12:04.654 --> 12:05.966
No.

12:06.104 --> 12:07.796
But I've been between
your mother's legs.

12:07.934 --> 12:10.453
Tasted like soap,
but might've been the cilantro.

12:10.591 --> 12:13.215
What the fuck did you...

12:21.395 --> 12:22.914
Yeah.

12:30.059 --> 12:32.337
Sad.

12:32.475 --> 12:35.340
Mayans were great once.

12:35.478 --> 12:37.101
Under Alvarez.

12:38.136 --> 12:39.551
But now it's just...

12:39.689 --> 12:41.450
You can hide behind

12:41.588 --> 12:44.142
that fucking badge,

12:44.280 --> 12:47.421
but you let someone
get us inside,

12:47.559 --> 12:50.390
we can get you anytime outside.

12:57.086 --> 13:01.021
Are you supposed to be some kind
of leader or something?

13:01.159 --> 13:02.989
You're coming crying to me

13:03.127 --> 13:05.819
because you can't keep
your own men safe.

13:05.957 --> 13:08.339
Hey, hey. No, no, no.
This is not the time.

13:08.477 --> 13:09.927
Not the time.

13:24.907 --> 13:28.428
If y'all want to stay,
we got plenty of cots for you.

13:46.411 --> 13:47.930
Hey!

13:48.068 --> 13:50.795
How many times I got to
tell you, you don't touch this.

13:51.796 --> 13:53.280
Marcus.

13:53.418 --> 13:55.662
He knows better.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.492
Come on, Santi.
Let's wash up for lunch.

15:17.433 --> 15:18.883
Mmm.

16:28.780 --> 16:32.439
Soledad and I
have found common ground.

16:32.577 --> 16:35.166
And we hope
that you will join us.

16:35.304 --> 16:36.685
What is it
that Lincoln Potter wants?

16:38.756 --> 16:41.483
You think I don't know about
the puppeteer's hand

16:41.621 --> 16:43.036
up your asses?

16:47.178 --> 16:50.561
A doctor surprised me once
with a prostate check.

16:52.632 --> 16:55.600
I had that <i>pinche joto's</i> body
cut up

16:55.738 --> 16:58.155
and scattered all over the city.

17:03.125 --> 17:05.817
But, um...

17:05.955 --> 17:11.168
you seem comfortable
with that arrangement.

17:11.306 --> 17:12.824
Maybe it's in your blood.

17:12.962 --> 17:15.448
Your cuckold father
let the <i>Americanos</i>

17:15.586 --> 17:18.589
lock up his balls in a cage.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.665
Yes.

17:25.803 --> 17:28.806
Potter has sent us here.

17:28.944 --> 17:32.741
But what I'm comfortable with
is the belief

17:32.879 --> 17:36.986
that if we band together,
we puppets

17:37.125 --> 17:39.403
will finally have autonomy
from the U.S. government.

17:39.541 --> 17:43.579
Because as long as we're at war
with each other,

17:43.717 --> 17:45.926
they will own us.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.308
But this...

17:48.446 --> 17:53.072
confederacy isn't only smart
financially, but...

18:00.769 --> 18:03.254
Lately,

18:03.392 --> 18:05.670
I've struggled...

18:05.808 --> 18:08.639
with the thought of my legacy.

18:10.641 --> 18:11.849
As fathers...

18:12.988 --> 18:15.301
...you and I,

18:15.439 --> 18:18.304
we must decide...

18:18.442 --> 18:23.343
do we leave our children
an empire...

18:25.345 --> 18:27.036
...or a battlefield?

18:33.457 --> 18:36.011
And you expect my men

18:36.149 --> 18:39.187
to forgive these bastards

18:39.325 --> 18:42.051
after decades of blood spilt?

18:42.190 --> 18:44.261
That blood has spilled
on both sides.

18:44.399 --> 18:48.368
But we personally guarantee
that moving forward,

18:48.506 --> 18:52.131
our men will embrace
each of yours...

18:53.891 --> 18:55.617
...as brothers.

19:12.565 --> 19:13.773
Miguel.

19:17.363 --> 19:19.330
You want to be
a real boy, Pinocchio?

19:23.610 --> 19:25.233
Okay.

19:26.820 --> 19:29.202
Let's fuck
the <i>Americanos</i> together.

20:40.308 --> 20:42.310
His name was TomÃ¡s.

20:52.561 --> 20:54.563
Our top-tier Deluxe Suites

20:54.701 --> 20:57.256
include a queen-sized bed,
a private bathroom,

20:57.394 --> 21:02.433
a sitting area
and views of the courtyard.

21:02.571 --> 21:04.401
How much is that?

21:25.007 --> 21:27.631
What's the tier down from that?

21:29.253 --> 21:32.981
Our Standard Suites come
with a shower, toilet,

21:33.119 --> 21:37.330
queen-sized bed
and a lounge chair.

21:53.139 --> 21:55.348
Is there a tier below that?

21:59.697 --> 22:01.527
Stop calling me that.

22:01.665 --> 22:03.529
Because it's what you are.

22:03.667 --> 22:05.565
- I fucking ain't.
- You're proving it right now.

22:05.703 --> 22:08.257
I ain't proving shit.

22:08.396 --> 22:09.914
I'm fucking Puerto Rican.

22:10.052 --> 22:12.054
<i>- Boricua.</i>
- Yeah, my apologies on that.

22:12.192 --> 22:14.850
Fuck you. I ain't fucking Arab.

22:14.988 --> 22:17.370
- I'm fucking American.
- Exactly something

22:17.508 --> 22:19.476
an ignorant-ass
philistine would say.

22:19.614 --> 22:21.892
I told you to stop
fucking calling me that.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.618
Mm-hmm.

22:23.756 --> 22:25.585
Now go do your fucking job.

22:26.931 --> 22:29.244
- Fuck you.
- Yeah.

22:42.809 --> 22:43.845
Hey.

22:52.716 --> 22:54.373
Your bag's in there, okay?

22:57.168 --> 22:58.929
What did I do?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.589
Nothing, Ma.

23:03.727 --> 23:05.349
We talked about this.

23:07.316 --> 23:11.010
You keep falling.
You keep forgetting.

23:11.148 --> 23:13.633
This place is just better.

23:13.771 --> 23:16.256
It's safer.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.190
I'm sorry.

23:19.328 --> 23:22.124
I won't do it again.

23:22.262 --> 23:24.644
I will be good.

23:24.782 --> 23:26.335
Hey.

23:26.474 --> 23:28.476
You didn't do
anything wrong, Ma.

23:28.614 --> 23:30.857
Nothing.

23:32.445 --> 23:35.241
Please, <i>mijo,</i>
don't leave me here.

23:35.379 --> 23:36.691
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- It's best

23:36.829 --> 23:38.417
if you just go.

23:38.555 --> 23:40.419
You can, you can
see her tomorrow.

23:40.557 --> 23:43.422
Your son is gonna
visit tomorrow, okay?

23:43.560 --> 23:47.287
No, <i>mijo,</i> don't go.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.875
No.

23:51.222 --> 23:54.433
Please, don't leave me here.

24:01.129 --> 24:02.855
You got any idea

24:02.993 --> 24:05.996
the hell that's about to unleash
on you all for this?

24:10.172 --> 24:11.829
This is for Creeper.

24:21.529 --> 24:24.048
Who's running
the fucking pipeline?

24:24.186 --> 24:27.293
- Fucking tell me who!
- Bro, come on.

24:29.295 --> 24:31.055
EZ!

24:34.611 --> 24:35.888
Fuck!

24:39.685 --> 24:41.376
Fucking tell us!

24:43.136 --> 24:45.518
That's fucking enough!

24:45.656 --> 24:47.624
After what that motherfucker
did to Creeper?!

24:47.762 --> 24:49.418
This motherfucker
is an ass-kicking away

24:49.557 --> 24:51.317
from giving us anything we need.

24:51.455 --> 24:52.974
Fuck you for not knowing
what the fuck...

24:53.112 --> 24:54.251
Hey, hey!

24:57.012 --> 24:58.945
Hey! Hey! Hey!

24:59.083 --> 25:00.568
Get off me.

25:48.719 --> 25:50.376
What do we do?

25:53.482 --> 25:56.002
Find somewhere to dump
this motherfucker.

26:09.706 --> 26:11.949
Hello.

26:14.434 --> 26:16.713
You're late.

26:16.851 --> 26:19.439
If that's an issue...

26:19.578 --> 26:22.235
Oh, no, it's not an issue.

26:22.373 --> 26:25.756
I'm very grateful to spend
every minute with my grandson.

26:25.894 --> 26:28.310
I'm just worried about you.

26:30.381 --> 26:32.004
Look at me.

26:34.523 --> 26:37.285
I know firsthand what it's like
to live this life.

26:37.423 --> 26:40.460
I know what it does to someone.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.462
I'm fine.

26:46.328 --> 26:48.745
I'll see him tomorrow?

26:55.234 --> 26:56.960
I'm fine.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.501
Daddy!

27:21.640 --> 27:25.885
Hey. Oh, my God.

27:26.023 --> 27:26.990
Oh!

27:27.128 --> 27:29.337
You're so heavy. Uh-oh.

27:29.475 --> 27:31.511
Oh. Stuck in the spin cycle!

27:44.663 --> 27:47.044
Maria said you didn't
leave the house today.

27:56.053 --> 27:58.055
It's not healthy...

28:00.851 --> 28:02.853
...living like a prisoner.

28:08.341 --> 28:09.757
Don't be dramatic.

28:10.896 --> 28:13.899
You can leave any time you want.

28:18.800 --> 28:23.425
But you will never
be alone with my son again.

28:36.576 --> 28:39.372
Just wait.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.547
Right? This isn't so bad.

28:41.685 --> 28:43.238
Being together.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.863
A family.

28:57.494 --> 29:00.152
<i>What does</i> familia <i>mean to you?</i>

29:00.290 --> 29:02.810
Is it the squiggly line
of your DNA?

29:02.948 --> 29:05.364
Vainly fucking
to recreate yourself

29:05.502 --> 29:09.023
in this sullen, gassy form?

29:09.161 --> 29:11.335
Or a finger poked
with a jackknife,

29:11.473 --> 29:16.306
blood smeared,
oath taken, "brothers."

29:17.479 --> 29:20.206
My brother won't see me.

29:20.344 --> 29:24.279
'Cause I think
he's ashamed... of me.

29:26.109 --> 29:28.352
All I ever wanted was to be him.

29:30.182 --> 29:31.873
Even now,

29:32.011 --> 29:34.531
as he lies all shriveled

29:34.669 --> 29:38.328
and sponge-bathed in hospice,

29:38.466 --> 29:39.812
I still...

29:41.780 --> 29:43.782
I still envy him.

29:46.232 --> 29:50.133
Because he knows something
no one in this room does.

29:51.237 --> 29:53.170
The ending.

29:58.037 --> 30:01.765
But he was almost surprised,
remember, Ter?

30:03.767 --> 30:06.287
When you let the Mayans
nearly get my brother

30:06.425 --> 30:09.221
sitting all alone
in a hospital bed?

30:10.739 --> 30:13.673
What did you see
in that elevator?

30:13.812 --> 30:16.090
Hmm?

30:16.228 --> 30:18.230
When those bullets
tore through you?

30:19.265 --> 30:20.749
God?

30:21.820 --> 30:24.823
A vast yawning blackness?

30:28.309 --> 30:30.794
Or just...

30:35.316 --> 30:37.387
But...

30:37.525 --> 30:41.149
I believe everything's
a blessing if you make it.

30:41.287 --> 30:44.256
So I realized it was time
for the prodigal son,

30:44.394 --> 30:49.192
lost but now found,
to return home.

30:49.330 --> 30:52.920
Faithful servant to
the blood brothers of his club.

30:56.578 --> 30:58.304
Isn't life funny?

30:58.442 --> 31:02.688
If your brothers hadn't tried
to murder mine that day,

31:02.826 --> 31:03.896
we wouldn't be here right now

31:04.034 --> 31:06.036
having this
fascinating discussion.

31:07.072 --> 31:08.383
Fuck you.

31:11.559 --> 31:14.079
I'm making you a god,
with the power to smite,

31:14.217 --> 31:16.288
and that's your
only contribution

31:16.426 --> 31:17.565
to the conversation?

31:20.568 --> 31:23.847
Fuck me? Fuck you! I'll decide!

31:23.985 --> 31:24.848
- Stop! Please stop!
- No!

31:24.986 --> 31:26.712
- There he is!
- No, no, no.

31:26.850 --> 31:29.059
- Shut the fuck up. There he is.
- Please. Please!

31:29.197 --> 31:32.062
Thank you for joining
the program already in progress.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.513
Now we're all dying to know...

31:35.755 --> 31:36.756
...which family do you choose?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.587
Capital F or quotation marked?

31:43.349 --> 31:45.179
It's fine, sweetheart.

31:48.837 --> 31:50.115
Take me.

31:50.253 --> 31:52.220
You let them go.
You just fucking kill me.

31:55.051 --> 31:57.156
That's not how
the game's played.

31:58.571 --> 32:00.919
And no one likes a cheater.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.658
Now, I get it.

32:16.796 --> 32:20.145
It's a hard choice because...

32:20.283 --> 32:21.732
Hoosier?

32:23.734 --> 32:26.945
- Hoosier!
- Yeah-yeah, man?

32:27.083 --> 32:28.947
What's it gonna
be like tomorrow?

32:30.534 --> 32:32.260
I don't know.

32:32.398 --> 32:34.159
You're a fucking idiot, man.

32:36.195 --> 32:38.404
- 78.
- Cloudy?

32:39.612 --> 32:40.510
No, it's clear.

32:40.648 --> 32:42.408
Zero precipitation.

32:43.478 --> 32:46.136
Zero precipitation.

32:46.274 --> 32:49.208
I get it.

32:49.346 --> 32:53.488
Whoever you choose won't feel
the sun on their face tomorrow.

32:56.664 --> 33:00.219
Did you feel the sun
on your face today?

33:02.187 --> 33:04.568
Don't do it, man.

33:04.706 --> 33:06.708
- You know Emily's pregnant.
- Jesus. Fuck.

33:06.846 --> 33:08.538
- Don't do it. Please.
- Get back here.

33:08.676 --> 33:11.230
- Hey? Fuck.
- Please. Hey.
Please. I'm fucking begging.

33:11.368 --> 33:12.956
- Don't do it.
- I'm gonna take that as a no.

33:13.094 --> 33:14.509
No, no, no, no.

33:16.477 --> 33:19.031
Did you feel the sun
on your face today?

33:22.414 --> 33:24.278
Yeah.

33:28.213 --> 33:29.973
Oh, my. Precious.

33:35.772 --> 33:37.049
Hey.

33:37.187 --> 33:39.086
It wouldn't be right for me

33:39.224 --> 33:40.811
to try to sway your choice,
but you know.

33:40.949 --> 33:42.330
Hey, hey, hey.

33:42.468 --> 33:44.919
Stop being a bitch
and just fucking choose.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.852
Listen, I'll make this easier.

33:46.990 --> 33:50.718
I just need you to lift
a finger and point. Huh?

33:50.856 --> 33:55.378
They'll close their eyes
so they'll never know.

34:05.215 --> 34:06.630
No!

34:15.777 --> 34:17.779
I hope you have baking soda.

34:41.941 --> 34:44.634
I wish he would at least eat

34:44.772 --> 34:46.843
half as much as he throws.

34:48.776 --> 34:51.296
Aw.

34:51.434 --> 34:53.988
Oh, I was hoping I'd get home
before he fell asleep.

34:55.990 --> 34:59.752
Hmm. I spend all day
thinking about him,

34:59.890 --> 35:02.134
missing him.

35:02.272 --> 35:03.894
Hmm.

35:05.896 --> 35:07.588
And you.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.664
I thought you weren't smoking.

35:16.597 --> 35:17.839
I ain't.

35:19.841 --> 35:21.774
Everyone else in the club.

35:21.912 --> 35:24.812
They're all tense.

35:24.950 --> 35:27.366
I don't care
if you smoke, Angel.

35:29.368 --> 35:31.370
I didn't stop for you.

35:33.303 --> 35:36.444
I stopped so I can be
around a long time for him.

35:49.906 --> 35:51.528
How was your day?

35:53.634 --> 35:54.945
Quiet.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.603
Boring.

35:57.741 --> 35:59.295
Hmm.

36:03.851 --> 36:05.715
You guys get out of the house?

36:08.200 --> 36:10.927
We went for a stroller walk.

36:11.065 --> 36:13.067
He got scared by a dog.

36:13.205 --> 36:14.827
Mm. As he should.

36:14.965 --> 36:16.829
Dogs are sketchy.

36:17.830 --> 36:20.281
I thought you loved dogs.

36:20.419 --> 36:22.456
Hmm.

36:22.594 --> 36:24.596
I had a change of heart.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.429
How was <i>your</i> day?

36:33.708 --> 36:36.055
You know, quiet.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.334
Boring.

36:38.472 --> 36:39.990
Hmm.

36:40.128 --> 36:42.993
Here. Some excitement for you.

37:10.435 --> 37:12.471
Uh...

37:12.609 --> 37:14.887
Inland Empire.

37:16.751 --> 37:18.581
They're out.

38:23.646 --> 38:25.061
She's beautiful.

38:29.548 --> 38:30.998
Padrino.

38:34.657 --> 38:36.659
Shit, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

38:38.868 --> 38:42.492
There are things I don't know
that I thought maybe I did.

38:43.631 --> 38:45.633
The club's in a bad way.

38:55.471 --> 38:58.094
It's not my club anymore.

39:26.191 --> 39:28.469
Our brothers are dying.

39:37.651 --> 39:40.481
During the first war,
over the patch, how did you...

39:40.619 --> 39:43.070
How'd you finally get out
from under it?

39:44.865 --> 39:46.556
You thinking of surrendering?

39:46.694 --> 39:47.695
No, uh...

39:49.697 --> 39:52.251
I'm just tired of people dying.

39:57.049 --> 40:00.605
You're the first person
come around to visit.

40:00.743 --> 40:03.159
Shit, 40 years in the club.

40:03.297 --> 40:07.094
Past six months, not one
brother's come to visit me.

40:07.232 --> 40:09.786
Padrino, about that vote, man...

40:09.924 --> 40:11.616
I'm having a baby, <i>Ã©se.</i>

40:11.754 --> 40:14.964
Can you believe that? At my age?

40:17.484 --> 40:19.382
You know, you...

40:19.520 --> 40:22.489
you think you do the right thing
and everything's gonna be okay.

40:24.939 --> 40:27.563
But they don't tell you about
the other minutes of the day.

40:30.497 --> 40:33.292
The club life, it's fleeting.

40:34.259 --> 40:35.778
All of it.

40:35.916 --> 40:37.435
Good and bad.

40:38.815 --> 40:42.681
And maybe surviving
is-is the worst sin.

40:42.819 --> 40:46.340
I mean, all we do is end up
in a box or a cell...

40:48.307 --> 40:50.171
...a making of your own.

40:54.831 --> 40:56.661
I really am sorry...

40:59.284 --> 41:01.666
...about how it all went down.

41:02.770 --> 41:04.600
I always liked you, EZ.

41:09.950 --> 41:12.470
But if you ever show up
to my property again,

41:12.608 --> 41:14.126
I'll shoot you.

41:56.099 --> 42:00.172
<i>âª Somewhere I can live âª</i>

42:00.310 --> 42:04.901
<i>âª Somewhere you are
somehow his âª</i>

42:05.039 --> 42:09.112
<i>âª Somehow barely hanging on âª</i>

42:09.250 --> 42:12.391
<i>âª To the shore âª</i>

42:14.255 --> 42:18.708
<i>âª All the places in my brain âª</i>

42:18.846 --> 42:22.885
<i>âª Places some will say insane âª</i>

42:23.023 --> 42:27.234
<i>âª Places foolishly way âª</i>

42:28.235 --> 42:30.409
<i>âª Out here âª</i>

42:31.790 --> 42:35.518
<i>âª And did you hear âª</i>

42:35.656 --> 42:39.349
<i>âª If they canceled the show? âª</i>

42:40.903 --> 42:44.907
<i>âª Wild and willing âª</i>

42:45.045 --> 42:48.566
<i>âª To play songs you know âª</i>

42:49.567 --> 42:53.087
<i>âª I saw 'em last year âª</i>

42:53.225 --> 42:57.022
<i>âª But they played too long âª</i>

43:32.471 --> 43:35.060
Hey. Hey.

43:35.198 --> 43:38.029
Hi, little man.

43:38.167 --> 43:39.444
Mm, are you hungry?

43:39.582 --> 43:40.963
Oh, come on. Let's get up.

43:41.101 --> 43:43.068
Oh, there's my best friend.

43:43.206 --> 43:44.932
There he is.

43:56.357 --> 43:58.049
Baby?

44:02.501 --> 44:03.813
Baby.

44:03.951 --> 44:05.884
Hi, baby.

44:08.507 --> 44:10.371
What the fuck?

44:10.509 --> 44:13.581
- Where the fuck is Luisa at?
- You did right by me once.

44:13.720 --> 44:16.654
So this visit is personal.

44:16.792 --> 44:18.794
But the next one
will be professional.

44:20.174 --> 44:22.176
Whatever you guys
are looking for...

44:23.212 --> 44:24.489
...stop.

44:28.976 --> 44:30.495
What did I tell you, Angel?

44:30.633 --> 44:32.531
You treat us good,
we treat you better.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.844
You treat us bad...

44:39.642 --> 44:41.540
...we treat you worse.

44:47.443 --> 44:49.583
Let this go,

44:49.721 --> 44:52.206
before the innocent people
in your life pay the price.

45:09.430 --> 45:12.813
Hey. You're both up.

45:15.264 --> 45:17.369
What's wrong?

45:17.507 --> 45:19.820
What's wrong?

45:19.958 --> 45:21.615
Bad dream.

45:33.385 --> 45:35.111
Aw...

46:12.528 --> 46:14.564
We have to take this upstairs.

46:20.122 --> 46:22.503
We believe this bears
your immediate attention.

46:32.341 --> 46:34.584
Has anyone else seen this?

47:03.821 --> 47:06.099
Fuck. Come on.

47:14.659 --> 47:16.350
Thank you.

47:22.460 --> 47:24.220
Oh, shit.

47:24.358 --> 47:26.774
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

47:26.913 --> 47:28.604
Did I hurt you?

47:28.742 --> 47:30.571
No, I'm good.

47:30.709 --> 47:34.541
My God, Jesus, you two, just
get a room and bang already.

47:43.274 --> 47:45.172
Shut up.

47:45.310 --> 47:49.038
We just gonna wait
until we're all dead?

47:50.522 --> 47:52.248
That shit with Hector
and Wolverine,

47:52.386 --> 47:54.595
it's fucked up.

47:54.733 --> 47:56.597
Couldn't even imagine.

47:56.735 --> 47:58.979
Could have been any of us.

47:59.117 --> 48:00.912
EZ's gonna have a plan.

48:01.050 --> 48:03.121
When?

48:03.259 --> 48:08.264
We got no one standing
between us and SamDino anymore.

48:08.402 --> 48:10.922
We're all that's left
in Southern Cali.

48:11.060 --> 48:13.269
Alone and fucked.

48:13.407 --> 48:16.755
We don't have the pipeline,
we don't win the war.

48:16.894 --> 48:19.448
This thing's over.

48:19.586 --> 48:22.002
We fucking lost.

48:23.141 --> 48:25.523
Nothing's over
until we say it is.

48:26.489 --> 48:27.766
Hey.

48:29.113 --> 48:31.184
We've been up against it before.

48:31.322 --> 48:33.703
We got to trust E.

48:34.739 --> 48:36.051
Trust E?

48:36.189 --> 48:39.054
Only thing we got to show
for the reign of EZ Reyes

48:39.192 --> 48:42.954
is a fucking fresh coat of paint
on the clubhouse,

48:43.092 --> 48:45.336
a smoke-free Templo,

48:45.474 --> 48:47.890
half our brothers
are fucking murdered.

48:49.409 --> 48:52.481
The only thing
you can trust E to do...

48:52.619 --> 48:55.001
is get the rest of you fuckers
killed, too.

48:58.590 --> 49:02.249
Anyone know why my brother
called the emergency Templo?

49:34.178 --> 49:36.594
This shit stops now.

49:39.804 --> 49:42.738
- You okay?
- No, I'm not fucking okay.

49:44.705 --> 49:47.467
I got a visit this morning
from Cole.

49:47.605 --> 49:49.400
Fuck, for real?

49:49.538 --> 49:51.540
Who's Cole?

49:51.678 --> 49:53.059
Crazy-ass Special Forces dude.

49:53.197 --> 49:54.715
What'd he want?

49:54.853 --> 49:58.478
To tell us to stop looking
into the fucking pipeline.

49:59.582 --> 50:02.620
No wonder Soledad
didn't want our guns.

50:02.758 --> 50:05.554
- Yeah, she's getting them
from Cole.
- Obviously.

50:05.692 --> 50:07.245
No fucking wonder why
those cops ain't scared of us

50:07.383 --> 50:09.489
if they're running shit
for them in prison.

50:09.627 --> 50:11.318
Creeper said with us
being out of the game,

50:11.456 --> 50:13.734
heroin's dried up inside.

50:13.872 --> 50:16.013
It's just Storm 88
and that fentanyl shit.

50:16.151 --> 50:18.049
That fucking idiot
Louie was right.

50:18.187 --> 50:21.639
Cartel must have made the switch
to fentanyl after the warehouse.

50:21.777 --> 50:24.159
Easy way to make up
that money fast.

50:24.297 --> 50:28.335
Cartel to Cole,
Iron War, Storm 88.

50:28.473 --> 50:30.372
There's your fucking pipeline.

50:30.510 --> 50:32.926
What the fuck
are you smiling about?

50:33.064 --> 50:35.480
All we needed was to know
who the players were.

50:36.550 --> 50:38.035
Now we just...

50:38.173 --> 50:40.037
have to knock one off the board.

50:40.175 --> 50:44.765
Did you just not hear what
the fuck I just said to you?

50:44.903 --> 50:48.942
They came to my house
and threatened my family.

50:50.012 --> 50:53.671
They aimed a gun
at my little boy.

50:53.809 --> 50:55.673
EZ?

50:55.811 --> 50:58.883
It's over. We're done.

50:59.021 --> 51:02.473
No. We're just getting started.

51:02.611 --> 51:04.923
You already got us
fighting a fucking war

51:05.062 --> 51:07.133
that we are losing.

51:07.271 --> 51:08.582
Now you're gonna try
to take out Cole

51:08.720 --> 51:09.894
and the other mercenaries, too?

51:10.032 --> 51:12.517
No. Not Cole.

51:15.382 --> 51:17.764
Galindo thinks
we're being left behind.

51:19.973 --> 51:22.009
Fuck him.

51:24.771 --> 51:26.773
We're gonna take out the cartel.
