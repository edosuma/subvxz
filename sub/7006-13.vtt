WEBVTT

00:04.204 --> 00:06.138
<i>Hi again,
and welcome back to Tool Time.</i>

00:06.206 --> 00:08.731
Where we continue our look
at antique tools.

00:08.808 --> 00:11.106
These beautiful,
handcrafted, antique tools.

00:11.177 --> 00:16.341
Came from a time when more power
meant manpower. [grunts]

00:17.884 --> 00:20.910
Now, over here,
we have two pedal-powered machines.

00:20.987 --> 00:23.353
This happens to be
a pedal-powered scroll saw.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.220
Over here is a lathe.
Let me show you how this works.

00:26.326 --> 00:29.056
Take a seat here.
Now, say you're making a table leg.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.029
You're making a table leg.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.634
lt's like an exercise bike.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.869
While you're shaping your leg,
your leg's getting shaped.

00:42.942 --> 00:44.807
[imitates Pee-wee Herman laugh]

00:45.712 --> 00:50.479
Now, over here we have
an old rope-making machine.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.108
You simply turn the crank

00:52.218 --> 00:56.587
and three pieces of twine
become one piece of rope.

00:56.689 --> 01:00.125
ln the time before television, families
would sit around the rope machine

01:00.193 --> 01:02.889
and watch knots landing.

01:06.132 --> 01:10.193
- Tell us about this, Al.
- Well, this is an old hog oiler.

01:10.270 --> 01:13.000
Now, how does this compare
with the one in your mom's house?

01:16.509 --> 01:21.071
You see, the way these work
is the hog comes up

01:21.147 --> 01:25.083
and it rubs against the rollers like so.

01:25.151 --> 01:27.278
And the skin becomes moist.

01:27.353 --> 01:31.983
Oh. So, the hog actually looks
at this as kind of an ''oinkment.''

01:36.062 --> 01:38.963
Well, here's another tool
l'm hog-wild about.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.262
This is an antique sausage stuffer.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.302
Very simple.
The casing goes on this end,

01:43.369 --> 01:46.031
put your ground-up meat in here,
push the plunger down

01:46.106 --> 01:48.768
and you got yourself
a custom-made kielbasa.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.367
Very few moving parts.
lt's a nice, well-made tool.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.413
- That's it for antique tools...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.277
Not so fast.
You think we'd end this

01:56.382 --> 02:00.216
without me showing the audience how l
make my own personal brand of sausage?

02:00.286 --> 02:01.981
l prayed.

02:03.556 --> 02:06.923
Well, l got an old Taylor family recipe.

02:06.993 --> 02:12.090
Put the meat in the hopper up here.
l use a lean pork shoulder.

02:12.165 --> 02:15.999
Little bit of garlic, onion, chives.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.731
Then to make it spicy,
l go with a little cayenne pepper.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.636
[Cajun accent] l guarantee spicy.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.005
Jalapeno pepper
and a little chili powder.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.374
Sounds like it's gonna
be tough on the tummy.

02:25.445 --> 02:29.779
Way ahead of you, Al. l've got some
secret ingredients to help prevent that.

02:30.483 --> 02:34.442
All right. We go with a little bit
of Maalox. Just a touch.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.224
A little bit of this pink stuff just
for a dash of color. How about that?

02:39.893 --> 02:43.329
Just a touch of Gas Be Gone. Poof!

02:43.396 --> 02:47.059
And a little bit of Beano.
A soupâ€¡on of Beano.

02:47.767 --> 02:51.601
And just for safety's sake, l wouldn't
eat this stuff near an open flame.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.689 --> 03:47.456
Yeah. That would... Four o'clock
is great. Thank you. Bye.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.621
All right! l got that interview for the
research job in the Psych department.

03:51.698 --> 03:54.030
Where you work in the basement,
no windows, no pay?

03:54.100 --> 03:56.068
Yes! God, l hope l get it!

03:56.636 --> 03:58.604
- [doorbell rings]
- l got it.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.170
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:03.276 --> 04:06.439
l'd like to speak to the man
or the woman of the house.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.742
l'm the man of the house.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.876
May l ask what you're using
to solve your tough cleaning problems?

04:12.952 --> 04:14.647
[Tim] His mother.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.115
What have l told you about talking
to solicitors, Brad?

04:19.192 --> 04:22.127
You want to be
as warm and friendly as possible.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.685
- l'll handle this.
- But, Dad...

04:23.763 --> 04:25.526
- Brad.
- Uh, l go to Lakeside High.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.600
Stop by sometime. lt's filthy.

04:30.069 --> 04:32.037
lt's cold. Why don't you step inside?

04:32.138 --> 04:33.571
Thank you.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.038
[laughs] Uh, what are you selling?

04:39.412 --> 04:42.870
Liquid Wonder, the amazing new
multi-purpose dirt destroyer.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.611
Cleans grease, woodwork,
patio furniture, mini-blinds

04:45.685 --> 04:48.415
and, oh, so much more.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.649
l got a case
of Binford cleaner in the garage.

04:50.757 --> 04:55.194
But Liquid Wonder
has fast-acting sodium metasilicate.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.790
Wow.

05:02.101 --> 05:03.068
What is that?

05:03.169 --> 05:06.605
The most potent cleaning ingredient
the government allows on the market.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.834
[laughs]

05:08.941 --> 05:12.035
God bless America, huh?

05:12.111 --> 05:14.739
- l'll take one.
- Just one?

05:14.814 --> 05:16.247
Case.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.683
- [woman] That will be $40.
- OK.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.151
Thank you so much.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.223
Well, $40 for a case of this cleaner,
it's a steal.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.759
lt's a steal, all right.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.385
What's that supposed to mean?

05:29.462 --> 05:34.923
Tim, that woman flirted with you so
you'd buy her product. You fell for it.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.903
l didn't fall for anything. l wanted
some cleaner and to help my country.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.304
You have a whole garage
full of Binford cleaner.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.535
But not like this. Honey,

05:43.643 --> 05:47.602
this is the most powerful cleaning agent
approved for use during peacetime.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.949
Would you have bought that
if it had been a man?

05:53.052 --> 05:55.816
Yes. As long as it
had sodium Metamucil in it.

06:03.463 --> 06:06.626
Hi. Um, has Jill Taylor
come out of her interview yet?

06:06.733 --> 06:09.702
Because, uh, she's giving me
a ride home. l'm running late.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.499
l'm always running late.
l don't know what it is with me.

06:12.572 --> 06:17.305
l'm the receptionist.
l don't care what it is with you.

06:19.912 --> 06:21.209
Patty.

06:22.281 --> 06:23.339
- Yeah.
- lt went well.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.384
They're gonna bring me
to meet Matthews.

06:25.485 --> 06:26.952
Oh. Well, you're a shoo-in.

06:27.019 --> 06:30.455
You know more about psychology
than half of the professors here.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.684
How do you know so much
about abnormal behavior?

06:32.792 --> 06:34.919
Have you met my husband?

06:37.330 --> 06:40.663
lf l get this job, not only
will l get to work with Dr. Matthews,

06:40.733 --> 06:43.702
but my name will be on a research paper.

06:43.770 --> 06:44.737
[siren wailing]

06:44.837 --> 06:48.136
l hate to tell you, but your name
is also gonna be on a speeding ticket.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.368
Oh, no!

06:51.677 --> 06:55.238
l can't believe this.
l have never gotten a ticket.

06:56.282 --> 07:00.446
Good evening, ma'am. May l please see
your driver's license and registration?

07:00.553 --> 07:02.418
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

07:03.556 --> 07:06.286
- [Patty chuckles]
- [Jill] lt's here somewhere.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.922
Let me see. Uh, glasses,

07:11.998 --> 07:15.957
uh, hair brush, coupons, uh...

07:16.068 --> 07:18.798
- Tic Tac?
- Just the license and registration.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.839
Uh, l'll have a Tic Tac.

07:22.442 --> 07:27.709
Ma'am, l clocked you at 75 miles an
hour. The maximum speed limit is 65.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.238
l understand, officer. l am so sorry.
l never speed.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.445
lt's just l was so excited about
this job interview l just came from.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.353
lf l get this, my name will be
on a research paper on the effects

07:37.423 --> 07:41.291
of adolescent anti-social behavior
on inner-family dynamics.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.360
But l guess you've heard
that story a thousand times.

07:50.436 --> 07:52.370
Just tonight.

07:53.339 --> 07:56.900
Officer, um, l know this
isn't standard procedure,

07:57.009 --> 08:02.970
but could you possibly find it in your
heart to just let me off with a warning?

08:07.954 --> 08:12.414
Officer, l will never speed again.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.621
You think you can really
be more careful from now on?

08:17.730 --> 08:19.197
l promise.

08:20.399 --> 08:24.460
Well, l guess l can make an exception
and let you off just this once.

08:24.537 --> 08:28.701
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much!

08:28.774 --> 08:31.743
Don't mention it... to anybody.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.301
Oh, no. No.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.837
Good night.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.221
[chuckles] Boy, was that lucky!

08:42.288 --> 08:45.553
[laughing] Luck had nothing
to do with it.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.685
He would have let you off
with a dead body in the back.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.194
What are you talking about?

08:50.263 --> 08:53.027
l am talking about
that incredible job of flirting

08:53.099 --> 08:56.068
- you just pulled off on that cop.
- l was not flirting.

08:56.168 --> 09:00.127
Oh, you weren't flirting?
What was the hair flip thing about?

09:00.239 --> 09:02.173
- My hair was in my face.
- Oh, really?

09:02.241 --> 09:05.802
What about you flashed
your butt to get your license?

09:05.878 --> 09:09.507
- What about that?
- l was just reaching for my purse.

09:09.582 --> 09:13.348
And how about when you gave him
those helpless little-girl eyes?

09:13.452 --> 09:16.478
''Officer, l'll never speed again.''

09:19.191 --> 09:21.159
Oh, my God!
You're right. l was flirting.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.284
You were brilliant.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.793
l can't believe l did that!
l just had this argument with Tim

09:25.865 --> 09:29.824
about how disgusting it is
when women manipulate men that way.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.065
- God, l hate myself.
- Well, l hate you too.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.731
l tried to flirt my way
out of a ticket once.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.710
l got another one for indecent exposure.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.747
l don't want to talk about it.

09:45.651 --> 09:49.417
- Why do we have to clean all day?
- Because l like a clean house.

09:49.488 --> 09:54.016
No. Because you got suckered into buying
40 bucks of lemon-scented water.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.392
Lemon-scented water
with sodium meta-silverfish in it.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.158
Now, come on. Clean the garage.

09:59.231 --> 10:01.290
[doorbell rings]

10:04.904 --> 10:07.270
- Good evening again.
- Officer?

10:07.373 --> 10:09.034
l hate to disturb you, Mrs. Taylor,

10:09.108 --> 10:12.271
but l walked off with your
driver's license and registration.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.211
Oh! Thank you. Wait, officer.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.717
Um, l've been thinking a lot
about what happened today,

10:18.784 --> 10:22.151
and l'm really angry
at myself for what l did.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.553
Good. Then you
won't speed the next time.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.252
No, wait, wait.
Um, l know this is unusual.

10:27.326 --> 10:30.261
But l would feel a lot better
if you would just go ahead

10:30.329 --> 10:31.887
and give me that speeding ticket.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.863
Sorry, ma'am. lf l give you a ticket,

10:35.935 --> 10:39.564
then l'll have to give a ticket
to everybody who wanted one.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.673
[sighs] Oh.

10:53.619 --> 10:58.147
- There is an explanation.
- l'm dying to hear it, you know?

10:58.224 --> 11:02.524
To the untrained ear,
this is gonna sound ridiculous,

11:02.595 --> 11:06.656
but it sounded like you were
begging a Michigan state trooper

11:06.732 --> 11:09.758
to give you a speeding ticket.

11:10.936 --> 11:14.201
l wasn't begging. l was just asking
for what is rightfully mine.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.037
l was speeding
and he let me off with a warning.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.701
Ah!

11:18.811 --> 11:22.178
So you invited him over here
in the hopes that he reconsider.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.879
No. He was bringing me
back my driver's license.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.818
Huh? There's some part
of the picture missing here.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.948
OK, Tim,
l flirted to get out of a ticket.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.253
Really?

11:35.327 --> 11:40.162
Really. l'm worse than the...
the Liquid Wonder woman.

11:40.232 --> 11:45.465
Oh. No, no.
She was flirting to sell cleaner.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.769
Your flirting brought down
the entire criminal justice system.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.906
- Congratulations!
- Tim, it was entirely subconscious.

11:52.978 --> 11:55.538
- l'm ashamed of what l did.
- Don't be ashamed of it.

11:55.648 --> 11:59.084
You give the guy a wink
and you keep our insurance rates down.

11:59.685 --> 12:03.451
- l wish l could do that.
- What are you talking about?

12:03.522 --> 12:06.389
lf l had great legs,
l could drive as fast as l wanted to.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.394
You are entirely missing the point!

12:09.462 --> 12:13.421
The point is if l were a sexy woman,
my life would be a lot easier.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.904
And mine would
be a lot more screwed up.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.816
[Wilson] Hidy-ho, neighborette.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.822
May l ask why you thrash your trash?

12:44.463 --> 12:48.160
l flirted to get out
of a traffic ticket today.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.327
l sunk to the level of that saleswoman

12:50.402 --> 12:53.235
who sold Tim a whole case
of useless cleaner.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.432
Oh, you mean Liquid Wonder?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.414
l bought a whole case myself.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.608
From the Liquid Wonder tramp?

13:07.086 --> 13:10.317
Well, that is no way
to talk about Cathy.

13:10.389 --> 13:13.290
Cathy. Oh, Wilson.

13:13.359 --> 13:17.523
Well, Jill, unfortunately,
everybody, at some time or another,

13:17.596 --> 13:19.962
is susceptible
to the wiles of the opposite sex.

13:20.065 --> 13:24.593
Well, l come from the old school
of feminism. l don't want to be wily.

13:24.670 --> 13:27.036
l wasn't even aware
l was flirting with that cop.

13:27.106 --> 13:30.667
For all l know, l may have been doing it
in that job interview l had.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.871
Unfortunately, in many societies,
women are at a disadvantage,

13:33.946 --> 13:36.107
so that subconsciously, or consciously,

13:36.182 --> 13:39.242
they flirt in order
to level the playing field.

13:39.318 --> 13:44.153
ln other words, you guys own the
stadium, and we're the pom-pom girls.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.852
Well, l didn't make the rules.
l'm just on the winning team.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.731
The whole thing stinks.

13:52.798 --> 13:54.527
Well, l know who would agree with you.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.228
Charlotte Whitten,
the Canadian feminist.

13:57.303 --> 13:58.964
She said that whatever women do,

13:59.038 --> 14:03.668
they have to do twice as well as men
in order to be thought half as good.

14:03.742 --> 14:06.176
l don't mind working twice as hard.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.679
lt's these stupid games
l don't want to have to play.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.648
And l'm not gonna
let myself do it anymore.

14:11.717 --> 14:14.185
You men are so lucky
you don't have to do that stuff.

14:14.253 --> 14:17.814
- Well, sometimes we do it anyway.
- Ah, not you, Wilson.

14:17.923 --> 14:21.689
Oh, it's true. Whenever l want that
special book from Shirley the librarian,

14:21.794 --> 14:24.490
l roguishly flash my baby blues...

14:26.232 --> 14:29.065
...and eloquently
quote the Greek philosophers.

14:29.134 --> 14:32.763
l disgust myself,
but l always get the book.

14:35.908 --> 14:39.469
Well, we finally managed
to use up all the Liquid Wonder.

14:39.578 --> 14:42.547
Wait. One more bottle.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.848
- Wow, Mom. You look nice.
- Thank you.

14:49.922 --> 14:51.184
Who died?

14:53.025 --> 14:56.461
l'm not going to a funeral.
l have my interview with Dr. Matthews.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.894
l'm trying to look serious
and professional.

14:58.964 --> 15:02.400
Hey, guys. l'm taking... Whoa, mama!

15:03.235 --> 15:05.396
- What?
- Guys, go finish cleaning the garage.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.996
- Can't. We're out of Liquid Wonder.
- Use the Binford crap.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.406
l've never seen you in that suit.
You look hot.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.914
l don't look hot.
l look serious and professional.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.916
Come on, baby. Spin for daddy.

15:22.888 --> 15:25.550
What is the matter with you?
This is not sexy.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.991
- l am almost completely covered up.
- That's what's sexy about it.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.824
lt gets me thinking
about what you got covered up.

15:31.897 --> 15:34.764
Well, maybe l should just wear,
you know, a longer skirt.

15:34.833 --> 15:38.394
Even sexier. Mystery of the unknown.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.973
l could wear my burgundy pantsuit.
That's conservative.

15:42.041 --> 15:46.978
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. Nothing turns
a man on more than conservative.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.810
Remember what a fan
l used to be of Barbara Bush?

15:54.353 --> 15:56.321
You are unbelievable!

15:56.422 --> 16:00.153
l should just go to this interview in my
ratty old bathrobe and a shower cap.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.659
The blue one with the ducks on it? Yeah!

16:08.400 --> 16:11.733
Hello. Um, l'm Jill Taylor. l have
an appointment with Dr. Matthews.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.638
Oh, he's just finishing with the
other candidate. lt shouldn't be long.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.175
Thank you.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.946
Thanks for coming in, Brenda.
l enjoyed meeting you.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.312
And l'll be making
my decision later today.

16:24.383 --> 16:28.820
Thanks, Dr. Matthews.
l know l can do a great job for you.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.226
- Mrs. Taylor?
- Oh, Jill. Call me Jill.

16:35.294 --> 16:38.661
l'll be with you in just a minute, Jill.
l need to return a quick phone call.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.602
Do you know anything about that woman?

16:46.672 --> 16:52.633
l know that she has a 4.0 average and
a skirt that's five inches too short.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.269
Skirt.

17:05.790 --> 17:06.848
What are you doing?

17:06.925 --> 17:10.416
l'm cashing in my pom-poms
for the keys to the stadium.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.038
Jill?

17:29.982 --> 17:34.351
Hi. l'm just gonna need
a few more minutes here.

17:40.392 --> 17:44.692
- Dr. Matthews.
- Back to our old look, are we?

17:45.631 --> 17:48.794
Yes, we are. You know,
l wavered for a minute there.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.869
But, um,

17:50.936 --> 17:55.305
the truth is l object to women who
flaunt their sexuality to get something.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.843
l know because l have been one of those
women at least three times this week.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.539
l'm not sure l follow.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.514
Look, l don't want to get this job
based on how well l flirt.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.746
l have worked too hard for that.
l have excellent grades,

18:07.820 --> 18:11.153
top skills in data analysis and
research. l have led three study groups.

18:11.223 --> 18:14.386
There is not a professor
that wouldn't give me a reference.

18:14.493 --> 18:15.858
- Jill...
- lf l get this job,

18:15.928 --> 18:18.556
l want it to be based
on merit and not on this.

18:19.798 --> 18:22.961
What makes you so sure
l'm not gonna base this on merit?

18:23.602 --> 18:27.936
Well, l don't know that. l mean,
l'm not, you know, absolutely... sure.

18:28.006 --> 18:30.839
[clears throat]
OK, here's the deal.

18:30.909 --> 18:35.937
This all started when my husband
bought this Wonder Cleaning stuff

18:36.014 --> 18:39.142
from this sexy saleswoman.
She was doing that hair flip thing.

18:39.218 --> 18:42.244
And then l got stopped for speeding.
And l did the hair flip thing.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.653
Then l saw Brenda.
She's doing the hair flip, so...

18:44.723 --> 18:47.055
Jill, this may shock you,

18:47.126 --> 18:49.890
but there are men who hire women
based on qualifications

18:49.962 --> 18:52.192
and not on how well they flirt.

18:53.765 --> 18:57.428
And you would be one of those men.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.606
lt is so nice to meet you.

19:04.676 --> 19:08.806
l knew the moment l saw you you would be
a man of great character and wisdom.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.248
And l don't hire based
on flattery either.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.313
No, of course not!

19:15.821 --> 19:18.051
So, even though l thought l blew it,

19:18.123 --> 19:21.183
he gave me the job based
on my qualifications.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.354
l'm very proud of you.
And here is to the new job.

19:24.429 --> 19:25.987
Thank you.

19:27.766 --> 19:31.668
So l hope you learned
something from all of this.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.163
Yes... yes, of course.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.402
What did you learn?

19:38.477 --> 19:42.038
lsn't it enough that l learned
something? Do l have to explain it?

19:43.448 --> 19:46.110
You should've learned
that a woman doesn't have to flirt

19:46.185 --> 19:48.085
to get what she wants. Mmm.

19:48.153 --> 19:52.613
She can move ahead in her life with
talent, honesty and determination,

19:52.691 --> 19:56.183
and hard work, and... Are you listening
to anything l'm saying?

19:56.261 --> 19:57.785
Hm?

19:58.764 --> 20:02.860
l'm sorry.
But that... bun is driving me crazy.

20:02.935 --> 20:07.099
- The bun?
- And that granny get-up. Hoo-haw!

20:10.242 --> 20:13.700
<i>[monkey sounds on radio]</i>

20:20.118 --> 20:22.211
[siren wails]

20:24.323 --> 20:26.484
Oh, no!

20:26.558 --> 20:28.458
No, no, no, no!

20:35.734 --> 20:37.031
Good evening, sir.

20:37.102 --> 20:41.766
Good evening. lt's downright balmy
for January, isn't it, officer?

20:41.840 --> 20:44.331
May l see your license
and registration?

20:44.409 --> 20:46.309
Of course. Yes, of course.

20:46.378 --> 20:49.313
They're in my jeans.
They're kind of tight, though.

20:59.057 --> 21:04.427
Sir, l clocked you going 50 miles
per hour. The maximum speed is 35.

21:04.529 --> 21:06.963
l'm afraid l'll have
to give you a ticket.

21:07.032 --> 21:10.092
Hold on a minute. You know...

21:10.168 --> 21:13.467
...l'm, um... l'm terribly sorry.

21:13.538 --> 21:17.235
And if you gave me a warning, you know,

21:17.309 --> 21:22.679
l... l promise l'd never do it again.
Promise.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.385
Sorry, sir. The law is the law.

21:27.452 --> 21:31.513
But l'm sure you have
the power to make an exception.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.657
[woman] Sir, get out of the vehicle.

21:42.734 --> 21:45.828
l'm going to administer a sobriety test.

21:50.976 --> 21:55.140
Your garage is full of Binford cleaner.

21:55.247 --> 21:58.739
But this cleaner has the most powerful
cleaning agent approved for your...

21:58.817 --> 22:00.478
[Jill laughs]

22:03.588 --> 22:07.615
You have a whole ga...
garage full of Binford cleaner.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.354
Yeah, but not like this, honey.

22:09.428 --> 22:13.262
This is the most powerful
cleaning solvent that, uh...
