WEBVTT

00:08.399 --> 00:10.184
- Effective immediately,

00:10.227 --> 00:12.751
I have decided to resign
as alderman of the 54th ward.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.058
- Now you have 60 days
to replace her with someone

00:15.102 --> 00:16.494
who better represents
the community.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.279
- Thanks to you,
today's my last day.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.759
- I can't very well hire
an assistant who doesn't know

00:20.803 --> 00:22.326
everyone in City Hall.

00:22.370 --> 00:23.327
- Ms. Pearson
is late for a meeting.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.415
Move aside now.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.069
- I can really use someone

00:26.113 --> 00:27.375
who knows his way around.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.246
- She asked if I'd be
her driver.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.508
- Did she?

00:30.552 --> 00:31.770
- It's not a bad idea,
you know?

00:31.814 --> 00:34.295
- Don't think,
just do your job

00:34.338 --> 00:36.166
and let me know what
Bobby's doing with this woman.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.515
- I'm giving her an office,
that's all.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.169
- Hey, that shit
with North Park

00:39.213 --> 00:40.736
is nothing compared
to what she could find.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.477
- And that's why
I hired her.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.567
- Cory, Mark, say hello
to your cousin Jessica.

00:45.610 --> 00:48.265
She is a successful
woman, Angela.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.093
- She's all talk, Mom.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.542
- ♪ I need a dollar, dollar

01:04.586 --> 01:06.327
♪ Dollar,
that's what I need ♪

01:06.370 --> 01:08.068

01:37.358 --> 01:39.447
- The one where you tell me
you work for the mayor

01:39.490 --> 01:41.188
and he wants to see me.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.624
- Turns out I work
for you today.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.626
- You decided to take
me up on my offer?

01:44.669 --> 01:45.888
- It's what you want,
isn't it?

01:45.931 --> 01:47.281
- Just a little surprised,
is all.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.717
What changed your mind?

01:48.760 --> 01:50.240
- Good news isn't
enough for you, lady?

01:50.284 --> 01:52.155
You gotta dissect
the shit out of it?

01:52.199 --> 01:54.244
- All right, first of all,
if we're going to do this,

01:54.288 --> 01:55.811
you're gonna have
to stop calling me lady.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.813
- If we're gonna do this,
maybe we should stop talking

01:57.856 --> 02:02.600
about what to call you
and get to work, Ms. Pearson.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.646
- Work it is.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.648
Oh, I got it
this time.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.392
- Hey, I'm sorry
that I'm running late.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.611
There was an issue with
the hot water in my building,

02:13.655 --> 02:16.440
and the super took
an hour to get here,

02:16.484 --> 02:17.789
though I'm not sure why

02:17.833 --> 02:20.227
'cause he lives
on the first floor.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.360
Why aren't you talking?

02:23.404 --> 02:26.189
- I hear you.
You're running late.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.799
- Yeah, so I just didn't want
you waiting around for me

02:27.843 --> 02:30.585
if you need to go see Morrissey
about the endorsement.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.674
- What are you talking about?

02:33.675 --> 02:37.200
- You wanted to go over
strategy for the WBC meeting.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.202
You made a big deal
out of it.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.856
- It's not a problem.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.949
- You're being weird.
Are you in the office?

02:46.992 --> 02:49.212
- Very good.
Keep me posted.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.304
I'll do that.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.395
- Classical.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.918
- I can change it
if you want.

02:59.962 --> 03:03.879
- Not on my account.
I like it.

03:03.922 --> 03:07.491
So have you always
lived in Chicago?

03:07.535 --> 03:08.971
- What are you doing?

03:09.014 --> 03:10.668
- It's called
making conversation.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.844
- I'm not one
for small talk, Ms. Pearson,

03:12.888 --> 03:13.845
especially when
I'm working.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.325
If you want to chat,

03:15.369 --> 03:17.371
get yourself a cab
or an Uber.

03:17.414 --> 03:20.243
- No, I don't need to chat,
but I do need someone

03:20.287 --> 03:22.680
who knows City Hall
is in the other direction.

03:22.724 --> 03:23.942
- We're not going
to City Hall.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.335
We're going to see
Mr. McGann.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.641
- I don't work
for Pat McGann.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.947
I work for the mayor.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.427
- We both do,

03:30.471 --> 03:32.386
and he wants you
to take this meeting.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.388
- And may I ask
where the mayor is?

03:34.431 --> 03:35.519
- He's out of pocket.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.912
- Out of pocket.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.566
And that's a quaint term
meaning?

03:38.609 --> 03:39.567
- Meaning none
of your business.

03:39.610 --> 03:40.872
- Hmm.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.659
- I asked you
to drive me, Nick,

03:44.702 --> 03:46.661
because you know
your way around,

03:46.704 --> 03:50.012
and I didn't mean that you know
which streets go one way.

03:50.055 --> 03:52.710
So the next time the mayor
or anyone else

03:52.754 --> 03:57.541
asks you to take me somewhere,
you check with me first.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.327
Those are my rules.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.899
- And go!

04:08.683 --> 04:09.945
- Last time I saw you,

04:09.988 --> 04:11.599
things didn't go
so well for you.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.557
I got my project,

04:13.601 --> 04:16.734
and you got some vague
job with the mayor.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.389
I'd say it worked out well
for both of us.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.522
- Glad to hear there
aren't any hard feelings.

04:21.565 --> 04:22.871
- Not from me.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.568
Eh, where's Bobby?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.831
- Whatever you say to him,
you can say to me.

04:26.875 --> 04:30.052
-  You speak
for him now too.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.575
- Only when I need to.

04:31.619 --> 04:32.924
I hope that's not
too vague for you.

04:32.968 --> 04:34.839
- I'm beginning
to enjoy this.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.580
I can go all day.

04:36.624 --> 04:37.842
- Good.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.409
We can finally get
to know each other.

04:39.453 --> 04:40.802
Before you skip

04:40.845 --> 04:42.934
to the honeymoon,
I know there's something

04:42.978 --> 04:44.327
on your mind
or you wouldn't have

04:44.371 --> 04:46.460
summoned the mayor
first thing.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.331
Let's get to it.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.942
- The vacant alderman
seat in the 54th.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.509
- What about it?

04:52.553 --> 04:55.469
- I want my friend
Betsy Sullivan sitting on it.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.427
- I wasn't aware
you appointed aldermen.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.777
- I don't.
Bobby does.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.953
And now I'm telling
him who to appoint.

05:01.997 --> 05:04.652
I hope that's not
too vague for you.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.088
- Not that I don't
trust your judgment,

05:06.131 --> 05:08.786
but that's an important
ward for Bobby.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.397
So before I recommend anybody,

05:10.440 --> 05:13.791
I'm gonna have to do
a little due diligence.

05:13.835 --> 05:17.839
- A smart woman like you,
I'd expect nothing less.

05:17.882 --> 05:21.973
- See that?
That wasn't painful.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.759
We might just find
common ground after all.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.979
- Well, do me a favor,
Ms. Pearson.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.459
Do your vetting today.

05:29.503 --> 05:33.507
I don't want that seat
collecting dust.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.486
- Don't forget
your lunch, baby.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.183
There you go.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.316
Cory, come on.
- Coming.

06:02.187 --> 06:05.365
Hey, Mom, can I go
to Jonah's birthday party?

06:05.408 --> 06:07.802
- Yeah. When is it?
- Next week.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.543
- Uh, of course you can.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.936
Thanks for asking.
That was very polite.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.329
- Are we still going
to be here?

06:13.373 --> 06:16.332
- What?
- I thought we have to move.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.160
- No, no.
We're not going anywhere.

06:18.203 --> 06:20.162
Don't worry about that.
- Yeah!

06:31.260 --> 06:33.523
- He's not in yet, Keri.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.177
- It's 10:00.
Where is he?

06:35.220 --> 06:36.483
- I talked to him
for a couple seconds.

06:36.526 --> 06:37.875
He said he had some
personal business.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.268
- Okay.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.401
Does he know we have
a meeting at 2:00 today?

06:41.444 --> 06:43.054
- It's still on the books.
I assume he does.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.099
- Tell him
I stopped by.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.579
- While I have you here--

06:45.622 --> 06:47.929
- I'm not doing the stupid
"Faces of City Hall" thing.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.321
- Come on, Keri,

06:49.365 --> 06:50.584
ever since that messed-up
Jessica rollout,

06:50.627 --> 06:52.412
PR has been
really getting on me

06:52.455 --> 06:54.065
about doing something positive.
- I don't have time.

06:54.109 --> 06:56.198
- It's just a couple
of pictures for the website

06:56.241 --> 06:57.634
and a meet-and-greet
with some high school girls.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.157
In and out, I'll work
it around your meeting--

06:59.201 --> 07:00.376
- No, uh, no,
I like my privacy, Derrick.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.073
- I know,
but PR likes you.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.901
Chicago girl, civic duty,
you know how it is.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.207
It makes us
look relevant.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.991
You good? Good.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.210
I'll bring the photographer
by your office later.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.908
- You're a pain
in the ass.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.316
- No school today?

07:28.491 --> 07:30.188
- I'm spending some time
with my kids, Ms. Pearson.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.276
You have a problem
with that?

07:31.320 --> 07:33.322
- Not at all.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.542
The only thing I have a problem
with is you dumping McGann

07:35.585 --> 07:37.413
on me after what he did
to my family.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.242
- How'd you think this
was going to go, hmm?

07:40.285 --> 07:42.244
Did you think you were gonna
be spending your days

07:42.287 --> 07:43.941
helping out
in soup kitchens?

07:43.985 --> 07:45.247
You knew the deal.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.640
- Oh, I knew
he was a part of it.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.293
I didn't know
he was gonna fill

07:48.337 --> 07:50.426
the entire city council
with his cronies.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.168
- He doesn't.
- I don't think he knows that.

07:53.211 --> 07:56.127
- Look, from the minute you
pulled your little magic act

07:56.171 --> 07:58.565
and got Debbie Coats out,
it was just a matter of time

07:58.608 --> 08:01.132
before he made a suggestion.
It's what he does.

08:01.176 --> 08:03.091
- I was with him
five minutes ago,

08:03.134 --> 08:04.658
and it wasn't a suggestion.

08:04.701 --> 08:07.095
It was a direct order
for me to give to you.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.357
- Dad!

08:08.400 --> 08:11.012
- Son of a bitch.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.709
- Dad! Daddy!

08:12.753 --> 08:14.537
- What do you want
me to say?

08:14.581 --> 08:16.104
You want permission
to say no to him?

08:16.147 --> 08:17.105
- That's exactly
what I want.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.541
- Dad, look at me!

08:18.585 --> 08:21.109
- Strong, buddy!

08:21.152 --> 08:23.154
You saw what went
down on North Park.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.069
We'll end up in
the same goddamn place.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.028
- Not if you draw
a line in the sand.

08:27.071 --> 08:31.989
- It's one of 50 aldermen.
I can't die on every hill.

08:32.033 --> 08:37.038
- Besides, maybe
he's not such a bad choice.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.953
- He is a she,

08:38.996 --> 08:40.128
and you told
the press yesterday

08:40.171 --> 08:43.479
that was an important ward.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.699
- Yesterday was yesterday.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.579
- Good morning.
- Morning.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.754
What are you doing
in my office?

08:57.798 --> 08:59.495
- Besides brightening
it up?

08:59.539 --> 09:02.106
I was getting a filing system
started for you

09:02.150 --> 09:04.326
and getting rid
of this old-ass pen.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.110
By the way, is this when
you usually get in?

09:06.154 --> 09:08.025
It's not like I'm trying
to come in late or anything.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.375
I just want to know so
I can anticipate your needs.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.595
Coffee?

09:12.639 --> 09:15.511
- First of all,
that old-ass pen

09:15.555 --> 09:17.339
is a graduation gift
and a keepsake,

09:17.382 --> 09:18.514
so we're just gonna
put that back.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.384
- Okay.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.997
- As for my coffee,
I'm very particular.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.302
I get it on the way in.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.652
- I'm sorry.
I just wasn't trying to--

09:25.695 --> 09:27.044
- I know what you
were trying to do,

09:27.088 --> 09:29.046
and in time,
you will learn.

09:29.090 --> 09:32.180
But what I need now
is a lunch reservation for two

09:32.223 --> 09:34.704
and everything you can find on
a woman named Betsy Sullivan.

09:34.748 --> 09:37.098
- Hyde Park Betsy Sullivan?
- You know who she is?

09:37.141 --> 09:39.666
- Yeah, she's like
some rich b--woman

09:39.709 --> 09:42.146
who throws fundraisers
and shit, real society type.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.583
- Okay, well, that's a start,

09:43.626 --> 09:45.454
but I need more than
what you read in "Splash."

09:45.497 --> 09:48.413
- "Splash," look at you,
getting all trendy.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.241
- Okay, Yoli,
I need you to focus.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.592
I don't need gossip.
I need a dossier.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.158
If she's a public figure,

09:54.202 --> 09:55.595
there's information
on her businesses,

09:55.638 --> 09:58.554
politics, net worth,
lawsuits against her.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.382
- Yeah, I--I got it.
I'm on it.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.558
And you need
this by when?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.820
Right, by lunch.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.387
- If you're gonna
talk the talk--

10:05.430 --> 10:07.563
- Hey, hey, I got you.
I got it, I'm on it.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.565
Don't worry about me.
You're gonna have a reservation

10:09.609 --> 10:11.480
and a dossier
to choke un caballo

10:11.523 --> 10:13.177
in less than an hour.

10:13.221 --> 10:16.398
- Well, that's what I like
to hear, and, Yoli?

10:16.441 --> 10:17.834
Take that.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.271
- Yeah.

10:22.273 --> 10:25.320
Careful with that knife.
You could get hurt.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.539
- Wait, what are
you doing here?

10:27.583 --> 10:31.326
- There are no cameras
in this room.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.458
Relax, flack.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.504
I work here now.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.332
- You work
on the fifth floor?

10:37.375 --> 10:39.377
- I'm Jessica Pearson's
brand-new executive assistant.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.510
Wait, what?

10:41.553 --> 10:42.859
- Don't choke
on your McMuffin.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.252
- You work
for the same woman

10:44.295 --> 10:45.732
you trashed
all over social media

10:45.775 --> 10:47.255
and got fired
because of?

10:47.298 --> 10:48.735
- I didn't get fired
because of her.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.432
I got fired because
you're a spineless weasel.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.433
- Okay, don't
make this personal.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.695
You crossed the line,

10:52.739 --> 10:54.262
and you know it.
- According to you.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.567
- No, according
to the employee handbook.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.308
- Yeah, well,
you didn't have to do it

10:57.352 --> 10:59.615
in front of my friends.

11:01.617 --> 11:02.792
- I'm sorry.

11:02.836 --> 11:03.793
That wasn't the plan.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.142
Look, now that you're here,

11:05.186 --> 11:06.187
why don't you drop
the attitude

11:06.230 --> 11:07.362
and let me
show you around?

11:07.405 --> 11:08.363
I know this place
inside and out.

11:08.406 --> 11:09.451
I've been here two years.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.626
- I don't need a tour guide.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.106
- I wasn't talking about--

11:12.149 --> 11:13.629
- Let me ask
you something, flack.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.152
- Okay, that right there
is going to have to stop.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.894
- If I hadn't walked
in here just now,

11:17.938 --> 11:19.766
would you have
called me to apologize?

11:19.809 --> 11:23.160
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.775
- Can I be blunt,
Ms. Sullivan?

11:28.818 --> 11:31.299
- You can if
you call me Betsy.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.909
- The ward you're interested
in representing

11:32.953 --> 11:34.258
is on the South Side.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.869
- I know, I know.

11:35.912 --> 11:38.219
What's a white woman
from Hyde Park doing here?

11:38.262 --> 11:40.612
- That's the blunt part.
- From the time I was little,

11:40.656 --> 11:44.747
it was hammered into my head
how fortunate I was.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.923
There were some days
growing up

11:46.967 --> 11:49.796
where it killed me to know
that while I was taking ballet,

11:49.839 --> 11:53.190
those poor people across the
boulevard were taking bullets.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.193
So call it community service,
call it guilt,

11:56.237 --> 11:57.934
but I have always wanted
to help that community.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.241
- That's very reassuring,

12:00.284 --> 12:01.764
but if you really
wanted to help,

12:01.808 --> 12:04.680
then why build your last
factory out in Elmhurst?

12:04.724 --> 12:05.812
Why not in the 54th?

12:05.855 --> 12:07.335
- Mm, that's a fair question,

12:07.378 --> 12:09.685
but did you also know
that we employed

12:09.729 --> 12:12.732
over 100 former prisoners?

12:12.775 --> 12:15.256
I did not know that.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.823
- We gave them jobs.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.695
- It's my understanding ex-cons
aren't allowed in the union.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.915
How'd you
get around those rules?

12:21.958 --> 12:23.830
- Well, there are
always ways.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.658
But the point is,
it was good for everyone.

12:26.702 --> 12:29.749
- And, believe me, they were
grateful for the work.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.229
- Hmm.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.276
- I told you,
Betsy's the real deal.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.365
- She's that
and a whole lot more,

12:37.408 --> 12:38.801
and I'm afraid
she's not a fit.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.934
- I don't think I like
the sound of that.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.501
- I told you I had to do
my due diligence, Pat.

12:43.545 --> 12:44.807
- Yeah, well,
what's wrong with her?

12:44.851 --> 12:46.200
- Aside from being a racist?

12:46.243 --> 12:47.810
Let's just say her policies

12:47.854 --> 12:49.856
aren't in line
with the mayor's,

12:49.899 --> 12:51.553
especially her views
on labor.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.250
- You got all that
from one lunch?

12:53.294 --> 12:55.644
- I got all that before
the crab cakes arrived.

12:55.687 --> 12:58.212
- Well, you know, I'm just
gonna take this to Bobby.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.867
- Oh, and miss out on all
that time with me?

13:00.910 --> 13:02.912
You don't want to do that.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.740
Why don't I put together
a list of candidates

13:04.784 --> 13:07.003
that don't alienate
the mayor's base

13:07.047 --> 13:08.788
and works for both of us?

13:08.831 --> 13:10.572
I'll have my lovely assistant
send them over,

13:10.615 --> 13:11.834
and then we can finally
have that dinner

13:11.878 --> 13:13.401
we've been talking about.

13:15.490 --> 13:18.580
You do that.
- It's a date.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.672
- He doesn't take "no" well.

13:23.715 --> 13:26.457
- He'll get used to it.

13:32.681 --> 13:36.206
Sorry, it's so silly.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.860
- No, you're doing great.
Just a few more.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.819
Um, act like you're working.

13:43.561 --> 13:46.260
Good.

13:46.303 --> 13:47.609
- I keep thinking about how
models always say

13:47.652 --> 13:48.610
this is such hard work.

13:48.653 --> 13:49.872
Models work.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.396
- Yeah, right.
Sitting poolside in Bali

13:52.440 --> 13:55.095
is hell compared to document
production till 10:00.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.313
- Is that when
you get off?

13:56.357 --> 13:58.707
Delilah's has
a killer whiskey.

14:00.143 --> 14:03.277
- Oh, I--uh--
thanks, I'm flattered, but--

14:03.320 --> 14:05.322
- You're seeing someone.
I get it.

14:05.366 --> 14:06.758
- Derrick, help me out here.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.456
- Someone skipped
their HR lecture.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.458
Sorry, I didn't mean anything--

14:10.501 --> 14:11.851
- No, it's fine.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.375
Uh, I actually do have
a meeting, though.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.812
So, um, I have to go.
Thank you so much.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.207
- Yeah, thank you.
See you around.

14:23.688 --> 14:26.387
- Is Bobby meeting us there?

14:26.430 --> 14:29.216
- I thought you were just
bullshitting him.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.521
It's off.
Meeting got pushed.

14:30.565 --> 14:31.827
- What, why?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.307
- You know how
he is sometimes.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.830
- That's all he said?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.788
- That and that he's spending
the day with his wife.

14:36.832 --> 14:40.183
You know, happy wife,
happy mayor, good for everyone.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.490
Q&A is at 4:00,
Heidi Klum.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.804
- Dark roast with a splash
of cream, no sugar.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.371
I figured we might
be going late.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.851
- You know my drink.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.767
- I talked to a woman named
Donna at your old firm.

14:58.810 --> 14:59.855
I'm sorry.
Don't kill me.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.943
I know it's a big swing.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.597
- There's a fine line between

15:02.640 --> 15:05.295
being resourceful
and being intrusive, Yoli.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.341
- Which side of it
am I on?

15:07.384 --> 15:10.344
- Well, you're on the right
side, but you are pushing it.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.389
Do you have names for me?
- Are you kidding?

15:12.433 --> 15:13.956
I've been waiting
for years for someone

15:14.000 --> 15:16.350
to ask me who should be
on city council.

15:16.393 --> 15:17.699
I've compiled a short list,

15:17.742 --> 15:20.702
but, um, Carlos Salazar
is your real choice.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.748
Yeah, he's a legitimate
grassroots organizer.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.534
Last year, he staged a protest
against some whack-ass store

15:26.577 --> 15:29.276
that prohibited their employees
from speaking Spanish.

15:29.319 --> 15:30.625
It was truly inspiring.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.367
- And he deserves a seat
on city council why?

15:33.410 --> 15:34.716
- I thought
I just told you.

15:34.759 --> 15:35.978
- You told me
why you like him.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.806
I need someone I can sell
to the mayor

15:37.849 --> 15:39.547
and big-money backers.

15:39.590 --> 15:42.550
- Honest, I thought
you'd respond to Latino.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.552
- Because I speak Spanish?

15:44.595 --> 15:46.641
- No, because
you're Latina.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.817
You are Latina,
aren't you?

15:56.956 --> 16:01.917
- Aunt Lillian?
Wait--wait--wait now.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.877
Hold on, tell me
exactly what it says.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.925
- Can they just throw
us out like this?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.405
- It's gonna be all right.

16:11.448 --> 16:14.538
We're gonna figure
something out, okay?

16:15.539 --> 16:16.976
- I don't know what to do.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.500
- Tell me something,
did this happen just now?

16:19.543 --> 16:21.589
- It was supposed
to be 90 days.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.547
It's hard enough as it is

16:23.591 --> 16:26.333
with Angela working double
and triple shifts,

16:26.376 --> 16:29.553
and then, bam,
act of God, this.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.426
- This wasn't God.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.429
- Mama, you okay?

16:35.472 --> 16:37.866
I ran into Miss Joyce,
and she said--

16:37.909 --> 16:39.041
What's she doing here?

16:39.085 --> 16:41.261
- Angela.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.872
We're being evicted.
They want us out in a week.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.830
- I know what's going on.
I saw the signs.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.049
That wasn't my question.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.269
- You know what?
Lillian, it's okay.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.618
I gotta get back to work.

16:50.661 --> 16:54.317
- Yes, Jessica has to get
back to work.

16:54.361 --> 16:57.842
Thanks for checking
on my mother, Jessica.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.979
- What is wrong
with you?

17:04.023 --> 17:06.329
You never get so angry.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.765
She was only
trying to help.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.680
- I'm not angry
at Jessica.

17:09.724 --> 17:10.768
I'm angry 'cause
my little boy's worried

17:10.812 --> 17:12.466
about where
he's gonna live

17:12.509 --> 17:14.076
and whether he can go
to his friend's birthday party,

17:14.120 --> 17:15.817
and I don't know
what to tell him.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.080
- That is why I called her.

17:18.124 --> 17:21.344
- Before she got here,
you would've called me.

17:23.390 --> 17:25.870
You would've called me.

17:37.665 --> 17:38.753
- I'll have whatever
he's having.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.842
Just put it
on his tab.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.323
- You're early,
Ms. Pearson.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.629
They don't start
serving dinner till 6:00.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.109
- Pretty low
coming after my family.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.545
- Oh, this again?

17:48.589 --> 17:50.069
I thought we were
over North Park.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.940
- We were,
until you had someone

17:51.983 --> 17:54.769
move up the eviction date.
Seven days?

17:54.812 --> 17:56.858
That's not enough time
to pack a goddamn toothbrush

17:56.901 --> 17:58.642
much less find
a place to live.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.123
- My investors want
to see progress.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.430
I needed to send a message.
- Oh, bullshit.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.867
That message was for me,
and I got it, loud and clear.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.043
I also got the message you want
to send to the unions

18:08.087 --> 18:09.697
by putting Betsy Sullivan
on city council.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.046
- Betsy and I
are interested

18:11.090 --> 18:12.743
in making a difference
in this city.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.789
- The only difference
you're interested in

18:14.832 --> 18:16.138
is to your bottom line.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.705
Now, let me see if
I got this straight.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.533
If Betsy represents the 54th,

18:19.576 --> 18:22.057
she'll be able to slip a
loophole into the next budget

18:22.101 --> 18:26.061
which will let you hire
nonunion labor on North Park.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.543
That saves you,
what, 40, 50 million?

18:29.586 --> 18:31.675
- A good chunk of it going
to Bobby's reelection.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.591
- If he gets reelected.
You put that woman in

18:34.635 --> 18:36.593
in that neighborhood,
he won't be.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.379
- I don't agree.
I want this taken care of.

18:39.422 --> 18:42.556
- What you want
is the unions off your back,

18:42.599 --> 18:44.949
and you don't need her for that
when you have me.

18:44.993 --> 18:47.561
Well, how you gonna do that?

18:47.604 --> 18:49.519
- Don't you worry
about that.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.912
But when I do,

18:50.955 --> 18:53.523
my family gets the 90 days
they're entitled to

18:53.567 --> 18:57.527
and not a minute less,
are we clear?

19:00.878 --> 19:02.532
- Last time we shook,

19:02.576 --> 19:05.709
it came back to bite me
in the ass.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.972
- Remember that.

19:17.504 --> 19:20.289
- So there I was standing
with mustard on my blouse

19:20.333 --> 19:22.161
in front of the jury
desperately trying

19:22.204 --> 19:24.685
to remember the first lines
of my opening statement,

19:24.728 --> 19:28.993
and, um, I just really wanted
to run away in that moment,

19:29.037 --> 19:32.475
and then I heard a snicker
from opposing counsel,

19:32.519 --> 19:34.608
and that was all
the motivation I needed.

19:34.651 --> 19:37.132
Just...rage.

19:38.655 --> 19:42.311
Now here I am today
talking to a bunch of girls

19:42.355 --> 19:44.661
from my awesome alma mater
in front of the awesome

19:44.705 --> 19:48.317
Art Institute, and it doesn't
get much better than this.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.014
- You have time
for one more question?

19:50.058 --> 19:51.102
- Sure, yeah.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.495
Yeah, hi.
What's your name?

19:52.539 --> 19:55.324
- Uh, Tasha.
- Tasha, what's your question?

19:55.368 --> 19:57.152
- Are you married
or in a relationship,

19:57.196 --> 19:59.023
and if so,
how do you balance it all?

19:59.067 --> 20:02.201
- Um, actually,
no, I'm not.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.507
Gives me more time
to conquer the world.

20:04.551 --> 20:05.769
- This isn't a question,

20:05.813 --> 20:07.554
but I didn't know
you'd be this cool.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.469
- Thanks, I think.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.732
- No, really, you're, like,
classy and successful,

20:11.775 --> 20:13.386
and you have integrity.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.214
You're my new role model.

20:15.257 --> 20:18.652
- Well, thank you so much
for coming out today.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.480
- Okay, thank you.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.264
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:22.308 --> 20:25.485
- Okay, guys.
- Have fun.

20:28.270 --> 20:31.055
- Come on, baby.
Run it out.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.623
- Ooh, damn, baby.
You looking for me?

20:33.667 --> 20:38.280
- Hey, you, come--
take it outside.

20:38.324 --> 20:41.240
All of you, come on.
Get out.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.506
Sorry about that.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.509
- I've walked by a few
construction sites in my day.

20:49.552 --> 20:52.816
- And I'm sure
you've heard worse, but still.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.296
Frank Cramer.
What can I do for you?

20:54.340 --> 20:56.211
- Jessica Pearson,
I work for the mayor.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.343
- I thought you
looked familiar.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.301
I saw you on TV
the other night.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.520
- Yes.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.173
- Let me get these for you.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.610
This is my youngest.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.655
She, uh--she hates
when I sell them for her,

21:05.699 --> 21:08.310
but, boy, does she love
winning the award.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.704
So what does the mayor
want with me?

21:10.747 --> 21:14.621
- Well, actually, I'm not here
on the mayor's behalf.

21:14.664 --> 21:17.319
I'm here to talk
about Pat McGann.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.408
- Oh, uh, what about him?

21:19.452 --> 21:21.715
- Well, Mr. McGann provides
a lot of work for your men,

21:21.758 --> 21:23.717
and he's about to break
ground on North Park,

21:23.760 --> 21:25.284
which means plenty more.

21:25.327 --> 21:28.330
All he wants in exchange
for that work is a way

21:28.374 --> 21:29.723
to keep his costs down.

21:29.766 --> 21:31.246
- I seriously hope you're
not suggesting

21:31.290 --> 21:33.161
what I think you are.

21:33.204 --> 21:36.730
- All we're asking is a limited
percentage of nonunion labor.

21:36.773 --> 21:37.861
You still get
your fair cut.

21:37.905 --> 21:39.385
- I just want
to be clear.

21:39.428 --> 21:42.126
You're offering me money
to turn a blind eye.

21:42.170 --> 21:45.086
- All I'm saying
is that Mr. McGann

21:45.129 --> 21:47.218
is more than willing
to compensate for lost wages.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.524
- Mine or my men?

21:48.568 --> 21:50.265
- Well, that's all
a part of a conversation--

21:50.309 --> 21:52.398
- This is the conversation,
Ms. Pearson.

21:52.441 --> 21:55.836
We're having it right now,
and I don't fucking like it.

21:55.879 --> 21:58.621
- I know you don't know me.

21:58.665 --> 22:01.537
- And you have no reason
to trust me,

22:01.581 --> 22:03.496
but you don't want
a war with this man.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.149
- Well, you're right,

22:05.193 --> 22:06.673
and I already
let scabs through

22:06.716 --> 22:09.110
on his LaSalle site
because I don't.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.459
I know the rumors,

22:10.503 --> 22:12.331
but I take a payout
from that butcher

22:12.374 --> 22:14.333
and let this go,
what's next?

22:14.376 --> 22:16.813
I mean, it's suicide
for my union and for me.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.598
- It's business...

22:18.641 --> 22:20.730
and it's better for your men
in the long run,

22:20.774 --> 22:23.559
and Pat McGann
will remember that.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.431
- Do you have family,
Ms. Pearson?

22:25.474 --> 22:27.215
- I do.

22:27.258 --> 22:30.392
- And would you do anything
you could for them?

22:30.436 --> 22:32.307
- I'd like to think so.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.309
- Well, these guys
are my family.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.877
We're at each other's weddings,
and when someone has a baby

22:36.920 --> 22:38.879
or when someone's
in the hospital,

22:38.922 --> 22:42.404
we sweat blood for each other,
and I'm not selling them out,

22:42.448 --> 22:45.886
not a limited percentage,
not one of them.

22:45.929 --> 22:48.149
Now get out of here.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.292
- Yo, what were you guys
just talking about in there?

23:01.336 --> 23:02.685
- That was
a private conversation

23:02.729 --> 23:04.470
between myself
and the head of your union.

23:04.513 --> 23:05.775
- Listen to you.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.560
You're one of those
educated ones.

23:07.603 --> 23:10.258
Hey, I'm talking to you, lady.
- Get your hands off her.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.260
- We're just talking.
- You little piece of shit.

23:12.303 --> 23:13.653
They should've kept you locked
up when they had the chance.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.306
- What are you gonna do?

23:15.350 --> 23:17.439
You're not a real cop anymore.
You can't--

23:19.485 --> 23:21.443
- See that?
Look at me!

23:21.487 --> 23:23.314
It means I work
for the fucking mayor.

23:23.358 --> 23:25.621
I can do whatever I want.
Now get the fuck out of here.

23:40.549 --> 23:41.985
- You gonna talk about that?

23:42.029 --> 23:43.465
- Talk about what?

23:43.509 --> 23:44.640
- You act like
it's a nonevent

23:44.684 --> 23:46.207
and I'm gonna be
more concerned.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.383
- It was to me.
- I don't buy that.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.819
- What do you want me to say?

23:49.863 --> 23:51.560
- I want you to tell me
who that kid was

23:51.604 --> 23:53.867
and why you nearly separated
his head from his body.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.217
- He was all over you.
- He touched my arm.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.784
And I can take care of myself.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.873
- He's a two-time loser who
needed to be taught a lesson.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.396
- The punishment
did not fit the crime.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.702
- What's your problem, lady?

24:02.745 --> 24:03.703
It's what you wanted,
wasn't it?

24:03.746 --> 24:04.921
- Excuse me?

24:04.965 --> 24:07.271
- Someone who knows
their way around.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.448
You said it. You can get anyone
to drive you places.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.884
Just don't ask me
to be that guy

24:10.927 --> 24:13.713
and then be outraged when I am.

24:13.756 --> 24:16.542
Those are my rules.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.386
- Hey, you've reached
Jeff Malone.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.692
I'm out of the office
indefinitely on a case.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.172
At the sound of the tone,

24:38.215 --> 24:39.956
please leave
your name and number,

24:40.000 --> 24:41.915
and I'll get right back
to you as soon as I can.

24:43.133 --> 24:46.136
- Hey, it's me.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.791
Just...calling to check in,

24:48.835 --> 24:51.011
see how you're doing.

24:51.054 --> 24:54.928
Things are good here.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.365
That's a lie.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.236
I know.

24:59.280 --> 25:03.502
You warned me about what
I was getting myself into.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.722
But now that I'm actually

25:06.766 --> 25:10.247
helping a man I truly despise,

25:10.291 --> 25:12.119
it isn't easy.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.470
And I'm doing it all
for a family

25:15.514 --> 25:17.864
I'm not even sure
wants me around.

25:21.389 --> 25:24.523
It's funny, right?

25:24.566 --> 25:27.787
In New York,
I used to just snap my fingers

25:27.830 --> 25:30.833
and make things happen.

25:30.877 --> 25:34.489
That old trope doesn't seem
to be working for me here...

25:37.361 --> 25:39.015
And I'm lonely.

25:40.930 --> 25:43.063
And I hate it.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.024
And I miss you.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.904
I miss you.

26:12.005 --> 26:14.007
- Keri.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.315
What are you doing here?

26:18.359 --> 26:21.188
- I'm not sure, actually.

26:21.231 --> 26:22.929
- What's going on?

26:22.972 --> 26:25.496
- I had an unusual day.
It was a good day.

26:25.540 --> 26:30.327
I, um...had my photo taken
for the City Hall website,

26:30.371 --> 26:32.808
and I talked to this wonderful
group of young women

26:32.852 --> 26:34.984
about what it's like to be
the city attorney

26:35.028 --> 26:37.508
and, uh, a woman.

26:37.552 --> 26:40.250
And all I could think about was

26:40.294 --> 26:44.080
the married man
that I'm having an affair with

26:44.124 --> 26:48.519
and why he was being so distant
with me on the phone

26:48.563 --> 26:51.261
and why I hate myself
so much for this.

26:51.305 --> 26:52.872
I am so much better
than this, Bobby.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.569
- Keri.
- I know I'm not supposed

26:54.613 --> 26:58.051
to be here, but I just need
you to tell me something--

26:58.094 --> 27:01.620
- Stephanie had a relapse.

27:01.663 --> 27:04.579
Her leg gave out,
and she fell.

27:07.582 --> 27:09.236
When?

27:09.279 --> 27:10.454
- Doesn't matter when.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.195
We were at Northwestern
all day.

27:12.239 --> 27:13.980
- What are you gonna do?

27:14.023 --> 27:17.461
- It's MS.
We live our lives.

27:17.505 --> 27:18.941
Nobody knows
what tomorrow brings,

27:18.985 --> 27:20.290
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera--

27:20.334 --> 27:23.467
- Stop it.
Don't shut down.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.644
- Uh, one of the doctors said

27:25.687 --> 27:30.126
we should go
to the Mayo Clinic,

27:30.170 --> 27:33.216
look into alternative
treatments.

27:33.260 --> 27:36.045
- You should do that.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.004
- Bobby, everything okay?

27:38.047 --> 27:40.571
- Just Keri from the office.
Everything's fine.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.885
- I'm sorry.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.076
- Hi.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.469
Everything okay
with your aunt?

28:08.512 --> 28:10.079
- My aunt is fine.

28:10.123 --> 28:12.212
- Good, 'cause I was worried
you would miss

28:12.255 --> 28:14.605
your lunch with Carlos Salazar.
- Excuse me?

28:14.649 --> 28:17.260
- Carlos Salazar.
We talked about him, remember?

28:17.304 --> 28:18.609
For the alderman position.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.350
- Not that it's any
of your business,

28:20.394 --> 28:21.917
but I'm not in the market
for an alderman.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.266
- I'm sorry.
I just thought--

28:23.310 --> 28:24.528
- No, I know what
you thought, Yoli,

28:24.572 --> 28:26.139
and we went over
this yesterday.

28:26.182 --> 28:27.444
It's not your job

28:27.488 --> 28:29.098
to make appointments
I didn't ask for.

28:29.142 --> 28:32.580
It's not your job
to push your own agenda.

28:32.623 --> 28:33.929
And if you can't
learn that,

28:33.973 --> 28:35.278
then we're gonna
have a problem.

28:35.322 --> 28:36.627
- I can learn that.

28:36.671 --> 28:39.108
I swear, I can learn that.

28:39.152 --> 28:42.372
Can I get you anything?
- No, not right now.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.639
My office.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.033
Well, this must be serious.
- It is.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.470
I just got a call from somebody
at the clerk's office.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.124
It seems your cousin went
down there

28:55.168 --> 28:56.473
making a fuss about North Park
and her rights

28:56.517 --> 28:58.171
and how she's not
gonna stop fighting.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.086
- Fighting how?
- I'm not sure.

29:00.129 --> 29:01.783
That's why I'm asking you.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.959
- Are you worried she's gonna
start up another lawsuit?

29:04.003 --> 29:05.656
- Yes, I am,
and you should be too,

29:05.700 --> 29:07.528
considering your little deal
with the mayor.

29:07.571 --> 29:08.616
- I know Angela.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.313
She's proud and passionate,

29:10.357 --> 29:12.315
but she doesn't have
the time or the means

29:12.359 --> 29:14.056
to take serious action.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.971
- Well, you might not know her
as well as you think you do,

29:16.015 --> 29:18.321
'cause she's at city council
right now.

29:20.715 --> 29:23.326
- In regards
to the proposed ordinance,

29:23.370 --> 29:25.633
I'd like to open the floor
to the public.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.730
- H-hello.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.342
My name is Angela Cook,
and our building,

29:39.386 --> 29:41.997
North Park,
was bought up some time ago.

29:42.041 --> 29:46.175
And ever since then,
we've just been treated wrong.

29:46.219 --> 29:49.222
My mother's had
that place 51 years,

29:49.265 --> 29:51.615
and she's never been late
on rent, not one time.

29:51.659 --> 29:53.095
And she even planted
some jasmine

29:53.139 --> 29:55.402
by the entrance
to make it pretty.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.360
- Uh, ma'am, ma'am,
this hearing is about

29:57.404 --> 29:59.058
awnings on Division Street.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.711
- And while you all are
spending time on that,

30:00.755 --> 30:02.626
my--my home's coming down.

30:02.670 --> 30:05.412
We were promised three months
to get our things in order,

30:05.455 --> 30:07.022
and now we're told
to get out.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.371
Isn't there something
you all can do?

30:08.415 --> 30:10.373
There has to be a law.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.419
- Can somebody please tell this
young woman she has to leave?

30:12.462 --> 30:15.814
- These are people's lives
we're talking about here.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.381
- Ma'am, let's go.

30:18.425 --> 30:21.558
- Sorry to take up your time.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.299
- Okay, let's continue
the discussion...

30:23.343 --> 30:25.084
- Angela.

30:25.127 --> 30:26.389
It's okay.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.130
- They don't care.
- I care.

30:28.174 --> 30:29.436
- Really?

30:29.479 --> 30:31.220
'Cause if you'd done
what you promised,

30:31.264 --> 30:33.614
I wouldn't have to be here.

30:33.657 --> 30:36.182
Sorry, this isn't on you.

30:36.225 --> 30:38.097
- Can we go somewhere
and talk?

30:38.140 --> 30:39.533
Just the two of us.

30:43.624 --> 30:48.237
Wait for me here, okay?
Just--please. Just wait.

30:48.281 --> 30:49.673
Hello?

30:49.717 --> 30:51.588
- You want to tell me why
you're going around town

30:51.632 --> 30:53.547
bribing people
on Pat McGann's behalf?

30:53.590 --> 30:56.419
- I did not bribe Frank Cramer.
- I've been out 24 hours.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.334
You're about to cost me
the support of the unions.

30:58.378 --> 30:59.901
- If it weren't for me,
you'd be losing the support

30:59.945 --> 31:01.163
of a hell of a lot
more than that.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.643
- What's that supposed to man?

31:02.686 --> 31:03.905
- It means the vacant
alderman seat,

31:03.949 --> 31:05.385
the one out of fifty

31:05.428 --> 31:08.127
you were willing to toss
Pat McGann's way.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.519
He wanted to fill it

31:09.563 --> 31:11.260
with a woman
who'd decimate the unions.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.784
So instead of doing that
and costing you an election--

31:13.828 --> 31:15.308
- You thought you'd give
McGann what he wants

31:15.351 --> 31:16.309
and get Cramer
to look the other way.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.788
- Well, look at that.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.703
We're starting to finish
each other's sentences.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.662
- There's only one problem--

31:21.705 --> 31:23.490
Cramer's a stand-up guy.

31:23.533 --> 31:26.319
He runs a clean shop,
and he won't cross lines.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.537
- Well, in my experience,

31:27.581 --> 31:29.191
a man that holds
three mortgages

31:29.235 --> 31:31.628
on his home
just needs a push.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.108
Give him a day.
- It's been a day.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.936
Has he come crawling yet?

31:34.980 --> 31:37.591
- You know, I hope you're not
saying you want Betsy Sullivan.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.419
- I'm saying...

31:39.462 --> 31:41.943
you better find another
way to push Frank Cramer,

31:41.987 --> 31:43.423
because I've dealt
with the man.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.381
He's as loyal as they come,

31:45.425 --> 31:48.428
and no matter what you say,
money's not his weak spot.

31:52.214 --> 31:54.521
- Let's move on
to the next matter at hand,

31:54.564 --> 31:58.481
installation of streetlights
at 54...

32:02.224 --> 32:03.660
- Jessica Pearson's office.

32:03.704 --> 32:06.402
- How well do you know
the people in the courts?

32:06.446 --> 32:08.491
- I told you,
I know everybody.

32:08.535 --> 32:10.493
- Well, now's your chance
to show me.

32:20.242 --> 32:22.070
- Can you help me?

32:24.551 --> 32:26.248
- Hmm.

32:26.292 --> 32:31.862
I don't know.
Can I help you?

32:31.906 --> 32:32.994
- You're actually
gonna sit back

32:33.038 --> 32:34.387
in your chair
like that and gloat?

32:34.430 --> 32:36.432
Don't be a cliché.
- Hey, you're the cliché.

32:36.476 --> 32:40.262
Coming to me for help after
telling me to fuck off.

32:40.306 --> 32:43.004
- That's not what I said.
I didn't tell you to fuck off.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.050
- Hey, what happened to,

32:45.093 --> 32:49.880
"I've been here five years.
I don't need a tour guide"?

32:49.924 --> 32:53.058
- Okay, this isn't
easy for me, okay?

32:53.101 --> 32:54.755
But I can't lose this job,

32:54.798 --> 32:57.888
and I dug up some shit for her,
and now she thinks

32:57.932 --> 32:59.412
I'm a walking,
talking Wikipedia page.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.153
Like, she wants arrest records

33:01.196 --> 33:03.155
and sealed court
document orders--

33:03.198 --> 33:06.027
- And you don't know
where to look.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.028
- Please tell me you do.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.116
Look, we can fight later,

33:08.160 --> 33:09.291
and you can rub
my nose in it,

33:09.335 --> 33:13.252
but right now
I really need this.

33:13.295 --> 33:15.994
- Only doing this because
the mayor's not in

33:16.037 --> 33:18.039
and I happen to have
some free time.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.520
- Well, yeah, I know, I know.
You're a very proud man.

33:20.563 --> 33:23.523
So, uh, can we do this?

33:23.566 --> 33:26.917
- All aboard
the Derrick tour guide

33:26.961 --> 33:28.832
of doing your job.

33:33.141 --> 33:35.013
- You need anything
else tonight?

33:35.056 --> 33:37.450
I've got a life, you know?
- I'm not sure.

33:37.493 --> 33:40.018
- That's a strange answer
from a woman like you.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.149
- A woman like me?

33:41.193 --> 33:42.498
- From what I've seen,

33:42.542 --> 33:45.023
you don't have
a lot of self-doubt.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.981
- Some decisions
are easier than others.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.896
- What did McGann do now?

33:48.939 --> 33:51.377
- Mm. What makes you think
he did anything?

33:51.420 --> 33:53.031
- 'Cause I know
how he operates,

33:53.074 --> 33:54.249
and when you cross
him like you did,

33:54.293 --> 33:55.511
he goes right
for the Achilles.

33:59.559 --> 34:02.083
- He's kicking my relatives
out of their apartment

34:02.127 --> 34:05.391
if I don't help make
that woman alderman.

34:05.434 --> 34:08.568
- Why do you care
about her?

34:08.611 --> 34:11.266
I mean, shouldn't that
be Bobby's decision?

34:11.310 --> 34:13.094
- He's been in bed
with that man so long,

34:13.138 --> 34:14.574
he doesn't know
what he wants,

34:14.617 --> 34:18.012
especially now with whatever's
going on at home.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.840
- That's where the self-doubt
comes in?

34:19.883 --> 34:21.146
You got yourself
boxed in

34:21.189 --> 34:23.844
and you don't know how
to get out of it?

34:23.887 --> 34:26.020
- I know exactly
how to get out of it.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.369
I just don't know
if I want to.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.023
- Why?

34:29.067 --> 34:31.895
- Because it means hurting
a decent man.

34:31.939 --> 34:34.463
- Are you asking
for my advice?

34:34.507 --> 34:36.204
- I'm making conversation.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.598
- For conversation's sake,
if it's about family,

34:38.641 --> 34:41.166
I say do whatever
you gotta do.

34:42.993 --> 34:45.648
- It doesn't matter
what lines are crossed?

34:45.692 --> 34:48.347
- No.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.871
- Never?

34:50.914 --> 34:53.003
- Not for me.

35:03.405 --> 35:04.928
- Thank you for meeting me.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.930
- I, uh, was actually
gonna call you.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.410
- Oh?

35:08.454 --> 35:12.110
- I wanted to apologize
for my son's behavior.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.937
Heard he got into it
with you last night,

35:13.981 --> 35:16.940
and I'm sorry about that.
He's got problems, Ms. Pearson.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.899
My wife and I
have spent a fortune

35:18.942 --> 35:21.293
sending him in and out
of rehab, but nothing we do--

35:21.336 --> 35:24.905
- I know all about your
son's problems, Mr. Cramer.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.559
I also know
that he's on probation

35:26.602 --> 35:29.127
for beating up
his ex-girlfriend.

35:30.693 --> 35:32.956
- What are trying to say?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.090
- What he did to me constitutes
a violation of that parole,

35:36.134 --> 35:39.006
and with his record, he's
looking at at least five years.

35:39.049 --> 35:42.270
- Look, I'm not trying
to excuse his behavior,

35:42.314 --> 35:43.924
but it's not like
he assaulted you.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.404
- Well, I have
a sworn statement

35:45.447 --> 35:48.929
from a Chicago police officer
that says otherwise.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.236
- Jesus.

35:51.279 --> 35:53.716
What do you want?

35:53.760 --> 35:56.502
- I think you know
what I want.

35:58.286 --> 35:59.722
- God damn it.

35:59.766 --> 36:03.335
If I don't push back on that
greedy son of a bitch,

36:03.378 --> 36:04.597
I'm done.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.600
My guys won't support me.

36:07.643 --> 36:10.211
I'm 30 years in, lady,

36:10.255 --> 36:14.041
30 years and a mountain
of debt from supporting...

36:20.395 --> 36:24.617
- I'll make sure you get
the compensation we discussed.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.584
You won't have trouble
with the union.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.325
- Well, that's good to hear.

36:37.369 --> 36:40.285
Thought our boy Cramer
was beyond reproach.

36:40.328 --> 36:42.112
- Everyone has a price.

36:42.156 --> 36:43.984
I'm gonna need you
to cut that check for him.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.507
- What about Betsy?

36:45.551 --> 36:47.074
- You got your cheap labor.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.554
That's all you're gonna get.

36:48.597 --> 36:51.209
That seat stays open,
my family gets 90 days,

36:51.252 --> 36:55.256
and I expect you
to keep your word.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.605
- Same goes for you.

36:56.649 --> 36:58.477
How's tomorrow night?
- For what?

36:58.520 --> 37:01.088
- For that dinner.
We should celebrate.

37:01.131 --> 37:04.657
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.485
It's from "Casablanca."

37:06.528 --> 37:08.704
- I know where it's from.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.619
You give my family
what's due them,

37:10.663 --> 37:13.013
and then we'll talk
about dinner.

37:49.876 --> 37:52.270
- They're both out.

37:55.403 --> 37:58.711
Danny wanted practically
the entire Dr. Seuss library.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.321
I think he finally dropped off

38:00.365 --> 38:03.237
when they cut down
the last Truffula tree.

38:05.413 --> 38:08.286
- He's such a sweetie.

38:13.465 --> 38:15.641
- How you feeling?

38:17.904 --> 38:21.647
- I decided I'm gonna
go up there tomorrow.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.126
- Okay.

38:25.215 --> 38:26.304
I'm going with you.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.566
- You're the mayor.

38:27.609 --> 38:29.219
You can't just disappear
and then expect

38:29.263 --> 38:30.351
no one to ask any questions.

38:30.395 --> 38:33.136
- Why not?
Who says so?

38:33.180 --> 38:34.355
If you're going--
- Listen,

38:34.399 --> 38:36.705
Bobby, you can barely
go five minutes

38:36.749 --> 38:39.491
without checking your phone
or answering an email.

38:39.534 --> 38:42.102
Why don't you tell me
how you're gonna take your wife

38:42.145 --> 38:44.278
to a hospital
in another state?

38:44.322 --> 38:47.586
- Steph--
- Oh, please, just...

38:47.629 --> 38:51.329
Please don't suddenly make me
a priority because I'm sick.

38:54.419 --> 38:58.205
- I'm making you a priority
because you're my wife.

39:00.163 --> 39:01.600
I'm going with you.

39:01.643 --> 39:03.384
End of discussion.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.263
- You have 90 days to move.

39:13.307 --> 39:15.353
Will that work?

39:15.396 --> 39:17.572
- We'll make it work.

39:17.616 --> 39:18.921
Come on in.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.277
I was just straightening up.

39:27.321 --> 39:30.237
Cory's working on a science
project about the solar system.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.631
Looks more like the Big Bang,
if you ask me.

39:32.674 --> 39:36.330
- I--oh, I think Pluto
is over here.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.549
Well, it could be Mars.

39:37.592 --> 39:38.637
That guy?

39:38.680 --> 39:40.290
- Oh, that's definitely Mars.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.510
It's the red planet.

39:42.554 --> 39:44.469
You don't need to clean.

39:44.512 --> 39:45.861
- I don't mind.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.779
- So how'd you get them
to change their minds?

39:50.823 --> 39:54.957
- Um, it seems an inspiring,

39:55.001 --> 39:58.483
charismatic woman
spoke to city council.

39:58.526 --> 39:59.832
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.442
Yeah, it's true.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.749
At first, it seemed like
they weren't listening,

40:03.792 --> 40:08.449
but turns out they were
actually quite moved.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.669
- Okay, that's
very kind of you,

40:10.712 --> 40:12.540
but I'm not buying
that for one second.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.368
You're the only one there
that was listening.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.718
So what'd you really do?

40:16.762 --> 40:18.416
- Whatever I had to.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.679
- You don't want
to talk about it.

40:20.722 --> 40:21.984
- I did what I had to do.

40:22.028 --> 40:26.467
- Well, whatever it was,
thank you.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.643
- I really am trying, Angela.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.471
- I know you are.

40:32.342 --> 40:36.390
- I met your boys
the other day.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.479
They are beautiful boys.

40:38.523 --> 40:40.829
You're doing
an amazing job with them.

40:40.873 --> 40:44.703
And, well, I don't
know how you do it all,

40:44.746 --> 40:47.009
but I'd like to get
to know them too.

40:47.053 --> 40:49.795
- Okay, well, I could call
you over to babysit some time.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.623
- I'd be up for that.

40:51.666 --> 40:53.276
- Oh, okay.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.974
- No, seriously.

40:55.017 --> 40:57.542
You want to babysit
my two kids?

40:57.585 --> 40:59.413
- You could do a lot worse.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.546
- All right. I'm gonna take you
up on that, you know.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.809
- Yeah, well, bring it.

41:22.305 --> 41:23.698
- What'd I tell you?

41:23.742 --> 41:25.526
It's made in Colorado.
It's killer, right?

41:25.570 --> 41:29.487
- Uh, yeah, I'm usually
a wine girl, but it's not bad.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.576
- I didn't mean to put you
on the spot yesterday.

41:31.619 --> 41:34.535
- Ah, don't worry about it.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.624
- Luke.
- Keri.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.715
