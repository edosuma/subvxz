00:18.852 --> 00:20.683
It's alive!

00:42.142 --> 00:43.609
Do you mind?

00:51.584 --> 00:53.677
L-16.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.154
Cowabingo, dude.

00:56.189 --> 01:01.354
¤ Senior Mutant Ninja Turtles ¤

01:04.330 --> 01:06.025
¤ Mutants in a wheelchair! ¤

01:06.066 --> 01:09.661
Dude, this prune pizza is bodacious.

01:09.702 --> 01:13.570
No! I just cowabunged in my pants.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.096
Barfaroni!

01:15.141 --> 01:17.735
I hope you're wearing
adult undergarments.

01:17.777 --> 01:19.369
- Are you?
- It depends.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.744
¤ Senior Mutant Ninja Turtles ¤

01:21.781 --> 01:23.681
¤ Mutant diapers ¤

01:23.716 --> 01:25.684
Dudes, where's Splinter?

01:25.718 --> 01:26.912
What are you doing?

01:26.953 --> 01:29.478
Looking for Shredder. No, not here.

01:29.522 --> 01:32.013
¤ Senior Mutant Ninja Turtles ¤

01:32.058 --> 01:33.582
¤ Heroes touching nurses ¤

01:33.626 --> 01:35.560
Look what I found in my old stuff.

01:35.595 --> 01:39.656
- My old skateboard.
- Dude! Let me see that.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.700
Cowabunga!

¤ Dealing with life changes ¤

01:48.575 --> 01:52.033
Well, I think you'll enjoy
Million Dollar Baby, Miss Dunst.

01:52.078 --> 01:54.410
Yeah, I hear really good things...

01:54.447 --> 01:57.245
My favorite part is
when Hillary Swank gets paralyzed...

01:57.283 --> 01:59.683
and Clint Eastwood
takes her off life support.

01:59.719 --> 02:00.708
Thanks.

02:02.989 --> 02:06.550
According to my spidy sense,
you owe me a kiss.

02:06.593 --> 02:09.994
Get it?
Like the movie that you were in.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.393
Buddy, are you OK?

02:16.436 --> 02:17.698
Can you hear me?

02:18.738 --> 02:20.706
Buddy?

02:20.740 --> 02:22.207
Dude?

02:27.680 --> 02:29.477
I told you it would be special.

02:29.883 --> 02:33.182
We're going down the river on this one,
though the odds of that inside straight...

02:33.219 --> 02:35.744
And there's his tail.
That will cost him.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.485
There's a new detective cleaning up
the streets of San Francisco...

02:39.526 --> 02:40.515
this fall.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.892
Rick Schroeder's Rick Shaw.

02:42.929 --> 02:45.921
With the help of his
faithful driver, Tan Wang.

02:45.965 --> 02:48.058
Ricky, we've got a robbery on market.

02:48.101 --> 02:51.127
It's Rick. Tan Wang, let's roll.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.764
Tan Wang, the noise.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.699
Damn it, Wang, do the noise!

02:59.546 --> 03:03.482
No criminal can escape
Shaw's wheels of steel.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.143
I'm not done with you yet, punk.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.017
Wang, throw it in reverse.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.526
Don't look down.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.433
Hold on tight, detective Rick Shaw.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.499
We like action movies. They're really fun.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.805
Then after the movie we come home,
and I turn my wife upside down...

03:30.843 --> 03:33.175
and stick a banana,
an apple, handy snacks...

03:33.213 --> 03:35.704
and a stick of string cheese
in her. Like this.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.952
We like Jackass: The Movie,
because we like pranks.

03:40.987 --> 03:44.150
Sometimes I fill up Billy with horse crap
and light him on fire...

03:44.190 --> 03:47.751
put him on a neighbor's porch,
ring the doorbell, and they stomp him out.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.989
Their shoes smell like horse poo.

03:50.029 --> 03:52.327
Hey, dog,
what was the last movie we saw?

03:52.365 --> 03:54.162
Sense and Sensibility, kid.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.259
Yeah, that joint was hot to dust.

03:56.302 --> 04:00.864
Yeah, we sneak some 40's up
in that bitch. Like this.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.375
Sometimes I go
to scary movies with Hans...

04:03.409 --> 04:06.469
and I get very nervous
and start to hyperventilate...

04:06.512 --> 04:09.606
so I blow in and out of Hans like this.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.314
Hans!

04:15.388 --> 04:18.221
Why not add a dollar
to the price of your movie ticket?

04:22.362 --> 04:24.489
You suck, Scott Norwood.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.054
You fucking jerk.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.227
Girls, grow up.

06:08.267 --> 06:11.065
- Did you say your prayers, Timmy?
- I sure did, mom.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.368
Good boy, son. Sleep tight.

06:13.406 --> 06:16.068
Dad, is the cat outside?

06:16.109 --> 06:17.838
Yes, he is, Timmy.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.040
Good.

06:57.216 --> 06:58.649
What is it, son? What is it?

06:58.684 --> 07:01.312
I thought I told you
to get the fuck out of here!

07:02.121 --> 07:03.315
Stupid cat.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.486
I don't like it
when you touch me like that.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.430
Excuse me. What year is this?

07:13.699 --> 07:17.157
- 2006.
- 2006?

07:17.203 --> 07:20.661
Man. Good luck, buddy.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.870
B. Rabbit, you're on.

07:28.915 --> 07:32.407
I told you, Daffy, my name is Bugs.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.979
No, your MC name is B. Rabbit.

07:36.022 --> 07:39.549
We got to appeal to today's kids.
No longer Looney Tunes.

07:39.592 --> 07:43.892
We're Lovuny Tazunes.
Real hip-hop, dog.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.826
Suffering succotash.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.266
- I'm nervous, Daffy.
- Listen, brother.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.035
You got to get out there
and don't choke again.

07:55.074 --> 07:58.066
- Which way is the stage?
- Just look at the sign!

07:59.212 --> 08:02.306
Get ready for the rap battle of the century.

08:02.348 --> 08:06.614
First, let's have a hand for D J Bacon Bits.

08:07.420 --> 08:11.754
Put your hands in the air
like you just don't care.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.954
All right, our first challenger tonight...

08:14.994 --> 08:17.428
hails from 8 Carrot Road.

08:17.463 --> 08:21.263
Put your hands together for B. Rabbit.

08:25.638 --> 08:29.597
And first on the mic tonight
is the reigning champion...

08:29.642 --> 08:34.773
the MC Hunter,
Elmer Fudd, with a PA.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.475
I'll get you wabbit.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.777
¤ I'm taking you to school,
call me the professor ¤

08:40.820 --> 08:43.846
¤ You're sexually confused,
'cause you're a cross dresser ¤

08:43.890 --> 08:46.120
¤ You like to kiss men,
and that's real funny ¤

08:46.158 --> 08:48.854
¤ Call up Hugh Hefner,
you a gay boy bunny ¤

08:48.895 --> 08:51.591
¤ You're lost on this stage,
you need a map, junkie ¤

08:51.631 --> 08:55.260
¤ You made a wrong left turn
at Albuquerque ¤

08:55.301 --> 08:56.632
One more, one more.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.433
¤ I'm a pimp
'cause my hunting powers are hot, son ¤

08:59.472 --> 09:03.203
¤ You would ride by on your home
with my double barreled shotgun ¤

09:03.242 --> 09:07.770
Now, hold on a second, Mac.
It's not wabbit hunting season yet.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.144
See?

09:09.181 --> 09:12.412
OK, your turn B. Rabbit.

09:16.689 --> 09:20.750
Choke! Choke! Choke!

09:20.793 --> 09:23.921
- You suck!
- Choke! Choke! Choke!

09:23.963 --> 09:26.227
Yeah, yeah.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.733
¤ I know that you call me
a rascally wabbit ¤

09:28.768 --> 09:31.601
¤ You say your R's like W's
and that's a really bad habit ¤

09:31.637 --> 09:34.333
¤ It's room not womb,
trees not twees ¤

09:34.373 --> 09:37.706
¤ You replace so many R's,
I thought you was Chinese ¤

09:39.345 --> 09:42.371
¤ You're so stuck on yourself,
I'll call you Elmer's glue ¤

09:42.415 --> 09:44.747
¤ I got you some coffee,
one lump or two? ¤

09:44.784 --> 09:46.945
So?

09:48.654 --> 09:50.121
No, he didn't.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.784
¤ I only dress like a girl
to prove that you're gay ¤

09:52.825 --> 09:54.520
¤ Would you like a kiss, handsome? ¤

09:54.560 --> 09:55.549
Really? OK.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.120
¤ Elmer Packs Fudd,
you heard what I said ¤

09:58.164 --> 10:00.997
¤ He's so bald,
I'll put a hare on his head ¤

10:01.033 --> 10:04.867
¤ I'll sit down on your head,
just like I was a Thinker ¤

10:04.904 --> 10:06.098
¤ Ain't I a stinker? ¤

10:08.574 --> 10:12.203
Holy Toledo!
B. Rabbit, wins!

10:12.244 --> 10:14.872
B. Rabbit, wins!

10:15.915 --> 10:17.883
I'm a disgwace.

10:17.917 --> 10:22.149
Yo, B. Rabbit it's me, Dr. Dre.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.678
What's up, doc?

10:23.723 --> 10:27.420
Ain't nothing but a G-thing, baby.
I'd like to offer you a record deal.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.657
You're gonna go down in history
as the first grey MC.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.830
That's all, bitches!
