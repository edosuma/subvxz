Oh, my God. Hi.
What are your names?

28:30.251 --> 28:32.504
My name is Kasey.
I'm 30 years old.

28:32.545 --> 28:33.838
Okay.
I'm Lindsay,

28:33.880 --> 28:35.715
and I'm 34 years old.
Okay.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.550
And we are
The Marilynds.

28:37.592 --> 28:39.803
The Marilynds.
The Marilynds, okay.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.930
I'm so emotional,
because this --

28:41.971 --> 28:43.890
Take it in. Take it in.

28:43.932 --> 28:46.518
[ Cheers and applause ]

28:46.559 --> 28:49.187
I remember auditioning
for one of these shows,

28:49.229 --> 28:51.981
and it literally changed
my entire life.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.650
Good for you for
feeling your feelings

28:53.692 --> 28:54.693
and taking the moment in.

28:54.734 --> 28:55.819
We're very grateful.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.362
Yeah,
we're very grateful.

28:57.404 --> 28:59.197
What kind of music do you guys
like to sing and make?

28:59.239 --> 29:01.449
We typically sing
country pop music.

29:01.491 --> 29:03.535
Oh, cool.
We've dreamed of doing duets

29:03.576 --> 29:06.287
with all of you, but, John, when
you turned around, I mean,

29:06.329 --> 29:08.873
we've had a long dream
of you sitting on the piano

29:08.915 --> 29:12.627
and us in ball gowns, like,
singing a trio, so...
Oh, my God.

29:12.669 --> 29:15.380
Well, of course I want you
to live your dream

29:15.422 --> 29:18.258
of you singing with John
on the piano.

29:18.299 --> 29:21.720
But I was in a girl group
for almost six years of my life.

29:21.761 --> 29:26.266
I know harmony and arrangement
like the back of my hand.

29:26.307 --> 29:29.102
And I turned because
I would be so excited

29:29.144 --> 29:30.729
and inspired to work
with you guys.

29:30.770 --> 29:33.523
Oh, my God.
John: I used to sing
with my siblings, too,

29:33.565 --> 29:35.483
and I would love
to work with you, too.

29:35.525 --> 29:38.445
There's something special
about that harmony that you have

29:38.486 --> 29:40.447
when you know that person
so well.

29:40.488 --> 29:44.993
And I've been arranging for
groups and choirs and harmonies

29:45.035 --> 29:46.619
since I was a kid,
literally.

29:46.661 --> 29:51.666
And I love hearing two voices
that are in sync together.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.376
I'm not a country artist,
but I've worked

29:53.418 --> 29:55.462
with some great country artists,
including Lady A.

29:55.503 --> 29:58.214
And I think you can go far
in this competition,

29:58.256 --> 29:59.966
and I would love
to be your coach.

30:00.008 --> 30:02.218
Thank you.

30:02.260 --> 30:04.304
I was gonna say that I was
in a band with my brother,

30:04.346 --> 30:06.598
so there's that sibling thing,
too.
There you go. Exactly.

30:06.639 --> 30:09.851
I love harmonies,
and it's just gonna be so fun

30:09.893 --> 30:12.270
to see you pretty girls, sisters
together up there.

30:12.312 --> 30:13.688
Absolutely.
You guys are gonna do great.

30:13.730 --> 30:14.981
Thank you.
Thank you.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.566
Blake, you have
something to say?

30:16.608 --> 30:18.943
Oh, my God. I-I forgot I was
on this show for a minute.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.445
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]

30:20.487 --> 30:21.946
I love him.

30:21.988 --> 30:27.077
You know, the idea of singing
with my sister horrifies me,

30:27.118 --> 30:29.287
so I can't relate
to any of the stuff

30:29.329 --> 30:31.164
any of you people
are talking about.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.083
I have a duo
on my team.

30:33.124 --> 30:35.835
I guess if you feel like
you're country pop,

30:35.877 --> 30:40.340
I would be thinking that John's
kind of a jazz, R&B kind of guy.

30:40.382 --> 30:42.050
What are you
talking about?

30:42.092 --> 30:43.301
I've never heard
anybody say,

30:43.343 --> 30:45.178
"I'm kind of
a country jazz artist."

30:45.220 --> 30:46.471
What are you
talking about?

30:46.513 --> 30:48.181
I'm just saying,
I've never heard that.

30:48.223 --> 30:49.849
I make R&B pop music.
That's not boo-able.

30:49.891 --> 30:52.644
That's a damn fact.
I collaborate
with country artists.

30:52.686 --> 30:54.312
You have no competition
on my team.

Oh, it worked! It worked!
Gwen: Oh, my God! It worked!

30:58.525 --> 31:01.444
I wasn't gonna go here, but you
made me push the button, John.

31:01.486 --> 31:04.781
I just don't understand
why I'm being ganged up
upon around here.

31:04.823 --> 31:08.326
Here's the thing.
I have no doubt in my mind

31:08.368 --> 31:10.161
that I would be
a great coach for you.

31:10.203 --> 31:12.622
And -- No, John!

31:12.664 --> 31:15.000
John, no!

31:15.041 --> 31:17.252

If -- If -- If we're putting

31:17.293 --> 31:20.588

I'm just going to stand in it.

have really cool voices,

they sound wonderful.

Camila's shenanigans,

I could definitely work
with a pop and country duo.

Alright, you beat me.
You beat me this time.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.754
I don't pick artists
based on what genre they are.

I'll turn for a country singer,
a rock singer,

32:45.548 --> 32:48.927
a soul singer, a pop singer,
a folk singer, all of it.

for artists who I love.

and smart liberties

We just were best friends.

really like each other.

35:43.059 --> 35:44.477

watch it with him.

"Zach, you got to get on there

with Blake."

that I'm his dad

36:01.536 --> 36:05.040

to other musicians and stuff,

36:05.081 --> 36:06.833

Thanks so much.

Oh, my God.

What the hell?
I love this guy.

Are you guys drunk
or something?

38:51.331 --> 38:53.041
Why didn't you turn around?
That was so good.

38:53.083 --> 38:56.127
Not yet.
Actually, yes.
Little bit, yes.

38:56.169 --> 38:57.754
[ Laughing ] Oh, my God.
Yeah. That makes sense.

38:57.796 --> 38:59.130
What's your name?
Hey, what's your name?

38:59.172 --> 39:01.132
I'm Zach Newbould.
I'm 19, and I'm from

39:01.174 --> 39:03.093
Northborough, Massachusetts.
I love you!

39:03.134 --> 39:06.680
Camila: Oh, my God.

39:06.721 --> 39:09.140
Zach, we turned around
at the exact same time.

39:09.182 --> 39:11.559
Yeah, he's an artist. Boom.
Well, I was like --

39:11.601 --> 39:12.936
I was like, the verse,
I was like, wow,

39:12.977 --> 39:15.605
he has an amazing voice,
amazing tone.

39:15.647 --> 39:16.940
'Cause that's
what I'm looking for,

39:16.981 --> 39:18.858
like, those voices
that are special.

39:18.900 --> 39:21.027
They don't even have to be
technically perfect yet.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.946
Right. Right.
'Cause I was kind of
in the same place.

39:22.987 --> 39:25.573
Like, I started off
in a singing competition show.

39:25.615 --> 39:27.867
You haven't mentioned that.
You know...

39:27.909 --> 39:30.328
I'll mention it
a million more times.

39:30.370 --> 39:32.872
I noticed, for example,
like when you were like...

39:32.914 --> 39:35.083
* I'm gonna use somebody *

39:35.125 --> 39:37.877
like, you would get
a little bit nervous or pitchy,

39:37.919 --> 39:42.882
and I've got the psychological,
therapeutic, physical,

39:42.924 --> 39:46.011
physiological tips for you.

39:46.052 --> 39:47.595
I honestly need
that kind of help right now,

39:47.637 --> 39:49.055
because, like,
the past year or so,

39:49.097 --> 39:50.849
my voice
has changed so much.

39:50.890 --> 39:53.935
I just need to kind of
figure out where my style's at.

39:53.977 --> 39:55.895
Camila: I genuinely feel like
I can help you,

39:55.937 --> 39:59.399
because I've been in your
exact same position and --

39:59.441 --> 40:01.401
Because she was on
a singing competition show.

40:01.443 --> 40:04.029
[ Laughs ] Right, right.
Did I tell --
Did I tell you I was on

40:04.070 --> 40:05.447
a singing competition show?
I-I missed it.

40:05.488 --> 40:07.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I didn't -- I didn't hear that.

40:07.282 --> 40:10.118
And she's had a birthday
since she started talking.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.829
[ Laughter ]

40:12.871 --> 40:14.706
Gwen:
Out of all the coaches here,

40:14.748 --> 40:16.124
I've been doing this
the longest, okay?

40:16.166 --> 40:19.252
I was in a band
for nine years

40:19.294 --> 40:21.755
before "Just a Girl"
even got on the radio.

40:21.796 --> 40:23.089
I want to be your "momager."

40:23.131 --> 40:24.549
Like, I think
that I can help you.

40:24.591 --> 40:27.218
Momager.
And I know --

40:27.260 --> 40:28.470
I know I can help you.

40:28.511 --> 40:29.971
Momager.

40:30.013 --> 40:33.058
But what I heard in your voice
is so much art.

40:33.099 --> 40:34.768
I don't know what genre
you're gonna end up doing

40:34.809 --> 40:36.144
'cause you're only 19.

40:36.186 --> 40:38.271
And I promise you,
if you went with me,

40:38.313 --> 40:41.608
it would be so much fun
to figure out who you are.

40:41.649 --> 40:43.068
I've already lived my dream,

40:43.109 --> 40:45.779
and now I just want to help you
live your dream.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.614
You guy-- You guys are
making it hard right now.

40:47.655 --> 40:49.074
Gwen: Yeah.
John: You're so lucky.

40:49.115 --> 40:51.910
You get to choose
between two amazing people.

40:51.951 --> 40:53.328
Your tone is
really beautiful.

40:53.370 --> 40:56.206
And I think embrace
that raspy-ness in your voice,

40:56.247 --> 40:58.291
because it actually
is your superpower.

40:58.333 --> 41:00.293
It's going to make you
sound special.

41:00.335 --> 41:01.836
Thank you.
And then now it's all about

41:01.878 --> 41:05.006
just channeling it
into great performances.

41:05.048 --> 41:06.800
Thanks so much. Appreciate that.
For you, it all comes down

41:06.841 --> 41:08.218
to this one moment.

41:08.259 --> 41:10.553
And as you look across
the panel here,

41:10.595 --> 41:14.891
there's only one coach here
who has never won

41:14.933 --> 41:16.518
"The Voice."
After all the --

Because it's my first season!
After all these seasons,

41:19.270 --> 41:23.066
only one coach has never won
"The Voice" on this panel.

41:23.108 --> 41:25.110
Blake, wouldn't you say
it's easier to win "The Voice"

41:25.151 --> 41:26.319
when you've been
on "The Voice"?

41:26.361 --> 41:28.029
This is
my first dang season.

41:28.071 --> 41:30.824
After 22 seasons
of this show,

41:30.865 --> 41:33.910
you still have
never won "The Voice."

41:33.952 --> 41:35.578
That's all I'm saying.
There's nothing wrong...

41:35.620 --> 41:37.997
That is an objective truth.
...about what I'm saying.

41:38.039 --> 41:39.791
I only want to say
one last thing.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.209
Is it the singing show?

41:41.251 --> 41:44.087
No. It's not.

your vulnerabilities

41:50.677 --> 41:52.887
were my vulnerabilities,
and then I --

41:52.929 --> 41:55.724
And they're now
not vulnerabilities anymore.

any better than that.

I love couture.

So, I'm so old-school with
opera and musical theater.

46:02.012 --> 46:06.266
At 4 years old, I started
playing "Phantom of the Opera."

46:06.307 --> 46:08.101
And I just sat down
at the piano one day

46:08.143 --> 46:10.812
and plunked it out,
and my mom was like,

46:10.854 --> 46:12.731
"Oh, I think it's time."

46:12.772 --> 46:17.068
And now I'm performing
any chance I get.

46:17.110 --> 46:20.155
My parents got divorced
when I was 8,

46:20.196 --> 46:23.241
and then my little sister
and my mom and I

46:23.283 --> 46:25.076
moved to live with my grandma.

46:25.118 --> 46:27.370
She would take me
to all my play practices.

She came to every single show,
and she was like my biggest fan.

46:32.292 --> 46:34.711
My mom and my grandma have
taught me everything

46:34.753 --> 46:38.173
that I know, and they taught me
how to be strong.

46:38.214 --> 46:41.259
I'm really grateful to have that
as my guiding light

46:41.301 --> 46:42.844

last year.

It was my wish for her to see me
in something like this,

orchestrating this entire thing.

We met at the Apollo Theater,

47:07.410 --> 47:09.371
and I was catering.
Okay. Oh, wow.

47:09.412 --> 47:12.040
And I looked on the stage, and
I was like, "I'm gonna work

47:12.082 --> 47:13.625
with him one day."
Whoa.

47:13.667 --> 47:14.834
Well, here we are!

of it was really cool.

which, obviously, she is.

The fact that she's covering
such a classic song

where she wants to go.

1:15:14.347 --> 1:15:16.725
And, really, ever since then,
I haven't stopped.

1:15:16.766 --> 1:15:19.477
Multiple times a week --
churches, venues, bars,

1:15:19.519 --> 1:15:22.564
you name it, I've been
singing and performing.

1:15:22.605 --> 1:15:26.067
When I was 15,
I was diagnosed with alopecia.

1:15:26.109 --> 1:15:27.610
Then my life changed.

1:15:27.652 --> 1:15:30.947
Alopecia is an autoimmune
disease where your immune system

1:15:30.989 --> 1:15:32.574
actually attacks
your hair follicles.

1:15:32.615 --> 1:15:35.618
My hair began to fall out,
then my eyebrows, my eyelashes

1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:39.372
to the point where
I had literally no hair at all.

1:15:39.414 --> 1:15:41.249
That was really
when I first experienced

1:15:41.291 --> 1:15:43.585
fairly severe anxiety
and depression,

1:15:43.626 --> 1:15:46.796
seeing my hair clog up my drain
in my shower every morning,

1:15:46.838 --> 1:15:48.340
it was really scary.

1:15:48.381 --> 1:15:49.924
Being able to look to music

1:15:49.966 --> 1:15:53.261
and use that as kind of
a therapeutic place for me

1:15:53.303 --> 1:15:56.514
was really crucial
for that time of my life.

1:15:56.556 --> 1:15:59.100
Towards the end
of my high-school career,

1:15:59.142 --> 1:16:00.518
my hair started growing back.

1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:02.645
But then recently,
it started growing in white.

1:16:02.687 --> 1:16:05.190
But I like the way it looks.
It's still really thin on top.

1:16:05.231 --> 1:16:06.983
I can't really rock
the no-beanie yet,

1:16:07.025 --> 1:16:10.111
but hopefully maybe my hair
will come back in its fullness

1:16:10.153 --> 1:16:12.489
but stay white
'cause I really dig it.

1:16:12.530 --> 1:16:14.824
I met my wife
freshman year of college.

1:16:14.866 --> 1:16:17.702
Started dating and got married
four years later.

1:16:17.744 --> 1:16:19.204
Now we have three kids.

1:16:19.245 --> 1:16:22.374
The more kids we have,
it's hard for me to justify

1:16:22.415 --> 1:16:24.626
making time
to pursue this dream

1:16:24.668 --> 1:16:26.711
that once seemed to be
the number-one priority,

1:16:26.753 --> 1:16:29.130
and now it's kind of become
on the back burner.

1:16:29.172 --> 1:16:30.632
I'm so thankful
that my wife's been

1:16:30.674 --> 1:16:32.759
just so excited for me
and such a supporter of it

1:16:32.801 --> 1:16:34.094

1:16:34.135 --> 1:16:37.514

that he's here.

1:16:37.555 --> 1:16:39.808
It's just an awesome opportunity
for people to be able

1:16:39.849 --> 1:16:41.393
to see how talented
he is.

1:16:41.434 --> 1:16:44.729

and I love when he sings to me.

lived in Orange County.

a really interesting artist

1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:38.893
What's your name?
Royale.

1:23:38.935 --> 1:23:40.937
Royale, good to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

1:23:40.979 --> 1:23:42.939
My sister's name's Endy.
Yeah.
What?

1:23:42.981 --> 1:23:44.107
Hey, you got a singer
on your team.

1:23:44.149 --> 1:23:45.817
Not just a singer.
I got the man.

1:23:45.859 --> 1:23:47.193
This is gonna be
a blast, dude.

1:23:47.235 --> 1:23:48.903
Bodie: Thank you, Blake.
Alright, welcome.

1:23:48.945 --> 1:23:50.613
Good to meet you.

Nice meeting you, Blake.

1:23:50.655 --> 1:23:52.157
Daly: Congratulations.
Go celebrate.

1:23:52.198 --> 1:23:55.368
I kind of feel like Blake
could win this season.

1:23:55.410 --> 1:23:56.619
I don't know why.
Really? I don't.

1:23:56.661 --> 1:23:58.204
You don't?
No.

I feel like
you're too cocky about it.

1:23:59.956 --> 1:24:02.167
You truly don't have a feel
for this show.

1:24:02.208 --> 1:24:03.293
I can tell you that.

1:24:03.335 --> 1:24:05.295
[ Laughter ]

1:24:05.337 --> 1:24:07.213
This is my show.
