WEBVTT

01:16.720 --> 01:17.949
Eric.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.033
Ragnar Lothbrok,
welcome to my house.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.080
You also, Rollo.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.079
I've done as
you asked, Ragnar,

01:25.160 --> 01:27.755
and sought out
these young men
to meet you.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.758
All of them
have sworn upon their rings
to keep this meeting a secret.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.992
You have done well,
my friend,

01:36.680 --> 01:38.512
although I knew
I could trust you.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.353
What are we here for?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.593
You are here, firstly,

01:42.880 --> 01:45.111
because you have
nothing better to do.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.878
See, all you lot live
idle and wasted lives.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.233
Listen to him!

01:54.520 --> 01:56.000
We have built a new boat.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.230
A boat?

01:57.440 --> 01:59.750
And with this boat,
for the first time,

02:00.920 --> 02:02.195
we can go west.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.554
Across the great sea
to a place called England,

02:06.960 --> 02:08.758
where countless
riches await us.

02:08.840 --> 02:11.912
How would we steer
across the open sea?

02:14.880 --> 02:16.633
We have discovered a way.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.558
You want us
to join you
in the boat?

02:19.640 --> 02:20.756
Yes, we do.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.714
And I have Ragnar's word
that we will all be equal

02:24.800 --> 02:26.632
and share equally
the spoils of our raid.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.120
If there are any.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.394
What is your name?

02:35.400 --> 02:36.800
Knut.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.278
I promise you, Knut,
I've heard witnesses.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.074
Just stories.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.312
"Just stories."

02:45.920 --> 02:47.195
"Just stories"?

02:50.680 --> 02:53.878
All things begin
and end as stories.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.799
We have to remember,
though,

02:55.880 --> 02:59.112
that Earl Haraldson
has ordered us
to sail east.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.600
The Earl knows nothing
about our new boat.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.355
He knows nothing
about the new
way of navigating.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.160
This is why he refuses
to let us go west.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.756
He could kill us
for disobeying his orders.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.320
Yes, he could.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.675
We can offer you
a chance to shine in battle

03:17.880 --> 03:19.633
and impress the gods,

03:20.440 --> 03:24.275
and to bring back
such plunder that you
have never seen before.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.311
Have you got
the balls to join us?

03:32.960 --> 03:33.950
I'll go.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.120
And I.
I will go.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.390
I, too!
I will, too!

03:38.480 --> 03:39.960
And I!
I will go!

03:49.560 --> 03:51.199
What about you, Knut?

03:52.360 --> 03:53.635
Are you coming?

03:54.160 --> 03:58.279
Yes, I want a good story
to tell my children.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.880
Ah!

04:00.760 --> 04:03.116
Prepare to leave
in the next few weeks,

04:03.560 --> 04:06.029
and tell no one
that doesn't need to know.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.955
Good throw.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.440
Well played.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.590
Well?

04:24.680 --> 04:26.876
My Lord,
there was a meeting.

04:27.440 --> 04:28.590
Where?

04:28.680 --> 04:30.558
In the house
of Eric Marteinn.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.513
Was Ragnar Lothbrok there?

04:36.200 --> 04:37.600
Yes, Lord.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.679
Shall we
show them the ax?

04:41.880 --> 04:44.873
Nothing would
please me more,
but it's too soon.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.396
We need
to watch and wait.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.554
Only good things
come from watching

04:53.720 --> 04:55.439
and waiting.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.113
Were you looking
at my wife?

05:19.840 --> 05:21.160
Have you slept with her?

05:21.240 --> 05:22.276
No, Lord!

05:22.360 --> 05:25.273
I swear
on all the gods.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.520
If she wants
to sleep with you,

05:31.080 --> 05:32.799
then I give
my permission.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.998
It will all
be arranged.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.320
So when do we sail?

06:05.400 --> 06:06.880
I already told you.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.159
I don't want
you to come.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.754
Why not?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.359
I need to leave
the children and the farm

06:13.440 --> 06:15.671
in the hands
of someone I trust.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.032
What if the Earl finds out
we have gone
without his permission?

06:19.120 --> 06:21.680
He might try
and claim our family home.

06:22.880 --> 06:26.669
This was going to be
the most exciting voyage
of our lives.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.794
To go west!

06:35.200 --> 06:37.840
I have dreamed
of it many times,

06:38.280 --> 06:42.320
and in my dreams,
we are always together.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.437
What if
there is no west?

06:48.320 --> 06:51.870
This is the most dangerous
and stupid voyage ever.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.158
What if we both die, hmm?

06:56.880 --> 06:59.236
Then who would
take care
of the children?

07:02.680 --> 07:04.000
Rollo?

07:04.880 --> 07:06.792
You have no right
to say that!

07:14.000 --> 07:16.515
All right, all right.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.070
You go.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.040
You go

07:21.560 --> 07:24.712
and I shall stay here
and look after the children.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.194
Siggy?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.713
Go away!

07:39.200 --> 07:40.714
It's so cold in here,

07:41.720 --> 07:43.632
but we'll be warm
soon enough.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.319
What do you take me for?

08:11.440 --> 08:12.999
Did you really suppose
that a worm like you

08:13.080 --> 08:14.878
could sleep
with a woman like me?

08:14.960 --> 08:16.758
I'm an earl's wife!

08:26.760 --> 08:28.717
Now I know who to trust

08:29.160 --> 08:30.753
and who not to trust.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.953
Take him.
Yes, Lord.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.953
Get rid of him.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.080
Come.
Go where?

08:42.159 --> 08:43.594
Outside.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.480
Get up!

09:42.160 --> 09:43.196
My love!

09:43.280 --> 09:45.078
Never mind that.
Defend yourself.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.669
How dare you!

09:49.840 --> 09:51.672
Am I not good
enough for you?

09:53.840 --> 09:55.832
Am I not strong
enough for you?

10:04.760 --> 10:05.876
Listen...

10:08.040 --> 10:09.030
You listen.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.398
Don't you remember?
I saved your life.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.470
How could I forget?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.235
You keep reminding me.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.599
I'm so angry with you!

10:44.120 --> 10:45.315
Stop!

10:47.320 --> 10:50.040
Are you mad?
You could have
killed each other!

10:50.120 --> 10:51.474
Is that what you want?

10:51.560 --> 10:52.994
We were just
having an argument.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.470
Well, never argue
like that again.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.475
Go on then!
Back to bed!

11:01.040 --> 11:02.190
Huh.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.354
It's a fine thing

11:10.600 --> 11:13.832
when the little pig
teaches the boar a lesson.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.793
Olafur surprised me.

11:32.080 --> 11:35.437
I didn't think,
out of all of them,
he would behave like that.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.472
A man lives
or dies by his honor.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.835
That's true.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.553
He thought so little
of mine

11:41.640 --> 11:44.872
that he really believed
that I would give you to him?

11:47.800 --> 11:50.031
Honor is a rare
commodity these days.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.634
Yes.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.596
Almost as rare
as those in whom
I can trust.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.630
It's true, my love,
our enemies are everywhere.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.360
"Everywhere"?

12:11.320 --> 12:12.549
They cannot prevail.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.237
They cannot prevail.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.713
Are you still angry with me?

12:30.600 --> 12:31.590
No.

12:35.840 --> 12:40.835
But my heart is in still
such pain that I cannot
be with you.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.276
Rollo.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.158
Nice work, Eric.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.040
Where is my anchor?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.676
It was promised
for today.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.118
Maybe your
blacksmith is a liar.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.032
Oh, I don't think so.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.555
This hair is from
his daughter's head.

13:38.720 --> 13:42.077
I promised him
that if he went
to Earl Haraldson,

13:42.160 --> 13:44.311
I would find
a way to kill her.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.439
I still
don't see Knut.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.515
Well, that's because
he isn't here.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.797
He hasn't
sent word either.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.759
That troubles me.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.196
We live
in a sea of troubles.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.876
But look,
some are ended.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.913
Here,
this is yours.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.072
And this is mine.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.914
Master.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.914
May the gods bless
us with powerful
winds and calm seas.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.189
Come here, slave.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.076
Cover the ravens.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.599
Feel that wind.
That breeze is up.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.551
Ready the oars!

18:09.480 --> 18:10.960
Come.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.389
Well?

18:17.040 --> 18:18.520
They have set sail.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.679
Good. They'll never
be heard from again.

18:21.760 --> 18:22.910
But...

18:24.520 --> 18:25.670
But what?

18:27.360 --> 18:29.636
What if Ragnar
is right?

18:29.960 --> 18:33.158
There are
no lands to the west!

18:38.040 --> 18:39.394
Get out.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.520
It's noon.

18:47.600 --> 18:48.590
Look at the board.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.034
Get the bucket.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.120
Not too far south.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.719
Nor too far north.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.240
The board works.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.519
How do we know?

19:24.640 --> 19:25.994
Ah.

19:32.520 --> 19:35.797
The great sea
is held in place
by Jörmungand,

19:35.960 --> 19:37.110
the serpent,

19:37.480 --> 19:40.279
whose giant body
encircles it,

19:40.360 --> 19:44.274
and who keeps
his tail in his mouth
to complete the circle

19:44.360 --> 19:46.431
and stop
the waves breaking loose.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.197
<i>But one day,
the god Thor,
son of earth,</i>

19:53.280 --> 19:55.556
<i>was fishing in the sea
for the serpent,</i>

19:55.640 --> 19:58.200
<i>using a bull's head for bait.</i>

19:59.280 --> 20:03.672
<i>Jörmungand reared up
and the waves
pummeled the shore</i>

20:03.760 --> 20:06.719
<i>as he twisted
and writhed in a fury.</i>

20:09.840 --> 20:13.151
<i>They were well matched,
serpent and god,</i>

20:13.240 --> 20:15.072
<i>in that furious fight.</i>

20:18.520 --> 20:21.354
The seas boiled around them,

20:22.240 --> 20:25.677
but then the hook
became dislodged,

20:26.040 --> 20:28.111
and the serpent
slithered free

20:29.320 --> 20:33.473
<i>and sank again,
so quickly,
beneath the waves.</i>

20:36.120 --> 20:40.194
<i>And soon,
the sea was calm
once more,</i>

20:40.880 --> 20:43.440
<i>as if nothing
had disturbed it.</i>

20:55.160 --> 20:56.514
Thor.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.520
Storm's coming.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.998
Should we
let down the sail?

21:05.680 --> 21:07.797
Floki, should we
let down the sail?

21:07.880 --> 21:10.634
Yes, we have
to take the sail down,

21:11.240 --> 21:12.799
and then we must row.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.599
If we are not
moving forward,

21:14.680 --> 21:16.512
then we will be soaked
by the waves and sink.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.716
Ready?

21:17.800 --> 21:20.076
Keep her straight!
You heard him!

21:33.320 --> 21:34.720
Tent!

21:46.760 --> 21:48.353
Shove the oars!

21:48.440 --> 21:49.635
Row!

21:50.440 --> 21:51.874
Row!

22:46.760 --> 22:48.433
Are you afraid?

22:48.800 --> 22:52.919
Yes, Ragnar Lothbrok,
I am afraid.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.720
But not for me.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.592
I am afraid
for my boat.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.276
Thor is striking
his anvil.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.831
He is angry with us.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.477
He wants to sink us.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.755
It's true!

23:24.920 --> 23:27.151
Thor is beating
his hammer.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.353
The lightning
is the sparks
from his anvil.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.557
But he's not
angry with us.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.319
I understand now.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.995
Why should he
be angry with us?

23:37.120 --> 23:40.477
Why should he want
to sink our boat?

23:40.560 --> 23:43.473
Don't you understand?
He is celebrating.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.712
He is full
of good news.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.960
He wants to show everybody
that he can't sink this boat.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.599
He loves this boat!

23:51.720 --> 23:53.632
Sit down, you idiot!

23:53.720 --> 23:57.270
It's my boat,
and the gods love my boat.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.680
Why should I

23:59.520 --> 24:01.398
not be happy?

24:01.840 --> 24:04.514
Floki, sit down.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.316
Remember,
you can't swim!

25:04.240 --> 25:05.993
Father Cuthbert!

25:08.000 --> 25:10.310
What is it,
Brother Athelstan?

25:10.800 --> 25:12.314
We can all
see the signs.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.710
Signs? What signs?
Of what do you speak?

25:14.800 --> 25:18.316
You know as well as we
that judgment day is at hand.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.834
Jeremiah says so!

25:19.920 --> 25:21.798
"And on that day,
the sun shall be darkened,

25:21.880 --> 25:23.473
"and the moon shall
not give her light,

25:23.560 --> 25:25.153
"and the stars
of heaven shall fall."

25:25.240 --> 25:27.596
In the name of God,
that is enough.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.955
But it's true!

25:29.440 --> 25:31.511
"And I stood upon
the sand of the sea,

25:31.600 --> 25:33.512
"and saw a beast
rise up out of the sea,

25:33.600 --> 25:36.035
"having seven
heads and 10 horns."

25:36.120 --> 25:37.474
I will hear no more!

25:37.560 --> 25:39.597
You will return
to your dormitory

25:39.680 --> 25:42.434
and pray to God
for forgiveness
and humility.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.678
And when the storm
has passed,
all shall be well.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.759
You will do
as I order.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.796
Yes, Father.

26:49.360 --> 26:52.319
There is no west!

26:58.920 --> 27:02.038
We are not sailing
towards any new country,

27:03.040 --> 27:07.114
but just into
an empty ocean,

27:09.720 --> 27:14.397
utterly and completely lost.

27:14.880 --> 27:19.909
Kauko, Leif,
we have been persuaded
by madmen and fools.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.632
The god Loki
is behind this voyage.

27:26.760 --> 27:30.071
That scoundrel,
that sly one.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.916
Trouble and suffering
are meat and drink to him.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.320
Shut up, man!
No!

27:35.920 --> 27:36.876
No.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.316
If anyone is mad,
it is you.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.316
I'm not the one
who convinced
all these good men

27:43.400 --> 27:47.440
to sacrifice their lives
for a dream, an illusion.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.754
It wasn't me
who joined forces
with The Sly One

27:50.840 --> 27:52.752
to get us to sail west

27:53.040 --> 27:55.919
into nothing,
into nowhere.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.992
- He's mad!
- Don't tempt the gods!

27:58.080 --> 28:01.278
Oh, and here we are, lost,

28:01.640 --> 28:02.960
certain to die.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.033
For what?

28:06.160 --> 28:09.039
Sit down and shut up.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.077
You sound
like The Sly One.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.078
Perhaps you are
the god of mischief

28:13.160 --> 28:15.391
who sends men mad
and sends them
to their deaths.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.516
Sit down!

28:16.600 --> 28:20.276
I curse the day I ever
agreed to come with you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.353
For this ship is cursed,
and we are...

28:40.280 --> 28:41.839
Release the ravens.

28:57.680 --> 29:01.640
If the birds do not return,
there is land.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.519
But if they do...

29:12.280 --> 29:13.270
Father!

29:18.080 --> 29:19.833
Good day to you, blacksmith.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.511
My Lord, how can I be
of use to you?

29:28.520 --> 29:30.830
You make anchors, don't you?

29:31.360 --> 29:32.350
Yes, Lord.

29:33.200 --> 29:36.318
Have you made any recently?

29:38.480 --> 29:40.199
No, not recently,
Lord Haraldson.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.794
You didn't forge an anchor
for a man called
Ragnar Lothbrok?

29:49.040 --> 29:50.190
I would have remembered.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.554
Don't hurt my daughter.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.513
Why would I hurt
your daughter?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.510
His Lordship just wants
to know the truth.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.271
Did you forge the anchor
for Ragnar Lothbrok's ship?

30:12.360 --> 30:14.238
Yes, I forged it.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.590
Let go of her.

30:18.200 --> 30:19.190
Put down your hammer.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.991
I promise you no harm
will come to your daughter.

30:36.640 --> 30:37.630
Look in the flames.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.359
The sages say that
we can see our future

30:47.960 --> 30:49.519
in the flames.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.236
No!

31:02.960 --> 31:04.189
Please, no!

31:04.280 --> 31:05.430
What do you see?

31:05.520 --> 31:07.193
I see my own death.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.112
No! No!

31:11.640 --> 31:15.429
No!

31:32.400 --> 31:33.800
They've come back.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.640
There's no land.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.400
Seabirds!

31:42.480 --> 31:43.800
Seagulls!

31:43.960 --> 31:45.440
Seagulls?

31:46.520 --> 31:47.840
Listen!

31:50.360 --> 31:51.680
Whoo-hoo!

31:55.880 --> 31:57.758
It works! Yeah!

31:57.840 --> 31:59.115
We made it!

32:00.160 --> 32:03.278
Row! We made it! Row!

32:03.400 --> 32:05.471
Ragnar, you did it!

33:00.080 --> 33:01.594
Tie the sail!

33:03.440 --> 33:05.557
Oars! Drop the oars!

33:19.040 --> 33:20.269
What is it?

33:20.360 --> 33:22.238
Why was the warning
bell rung?

33:22.360 --> 33:24.317
They've come.
They are here.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.153
Who is here?

33:26.240 --> 33:27.959
Hell and all its devils!

33:28.920 --> 33:33.517
Lock the doors
and stay inside,
all of you! Hurry.

33:34.520 --> 33:35.556
The gate!

33:46.480 --> 33:48.437
They know we're here.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.355
No one throw
their lives away
unnecessarily,

33:54.200 --> 33:55.919
even to impress
the gods.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.040
Stay close.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.077
They're here!
Come, Brother!

34:15.920 --> 34:17.195
Quick!

34:48.800 --> 34:50.712
Arne, get to work.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.560
Don't be afraid.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.600
Trust in God,

35:05.760 --> 35:07.160
and let us pray.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.355
This is the end!

36:20.440 --> 36:21.999
The Son of Man cometh!

36:40.680 --> 36:41.750
Get away!

36:41.840 --> 36:42.876
Leif.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.673
Ah!

38:53.120 --> 38:54.600
I don't understand.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.389
Why do they leave
such treasures
unprotected?

38:57.600 --> 39:01.480
Is there some spell,
some magic
which protects them?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.673
It appears not.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.079
Perhaps they think
their god protects them.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.712
If this is their god,
then he's dead.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.439
He is nailed
to a cross.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.880
He cannot protect anyone.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.429
He is not alive,
like Odin, Thor or Freyr.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.360
What use is he then?

39:39.680 --> 39:41.273
You speak our language?

39:44.160 --> 39:46.072
How do you
speak our language?

39:46.600 --> 39:48.193
I've traveled.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.994
We are told to travel,
to take the word of God.

39:51.560 --> 39:54.758
Please, don't kill me.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.437
What is that you
have in your hand?

40:10.160 --> 40:11.913
A book.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.469
The gospel of St. John,
I wanted to save it.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.515
Of all the treasures
I see in this place,

40:25.600 --> 40:27.159
you chose to save this?

40:28.600 --> 40:29.829
Yes.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.470
Hmm.

40:32.640 --> 40:33.869
Why?

40:39.640 --> 40:40.994
Why?

40:43.120 --> 40:47.876
Because without
the word of God,
there is only darkness.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.357
This is a strange
place indeed.

41:02.720 --> 41:05.792
We have been everywhere
and we have found no women.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.633
Just these strange men.

41:09.720 --> 41:12.394
I believe
they are the priests
of their god.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.114
Take what you will.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.436
This is what we came for.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.791
Why have you not
killed this one?

41:22.240 --> 41:24.118
He is worth more alive

41:24.840 --> 41:26.035
to sell as a slave.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.474
I will kill him.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.672
We have no room
left on the boat.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.399
I forbid it.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.312
How can you forbid it,
little brother?

41:34.400 --> 41:36.198
We are all equals,

41:37.560 --> 41:38.994
and I say he dies.

41:43.800 --> 41:46.679
Does it really mean
that much to you, brother?

42:03.640 --> 42:06.758
This is what
we care for your god.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.515
So much gold!

43:44.680 --> 43:45.670
Look!

43:46.760 --> 43:48.194
Keep them moving!

43:59.120 --> 44:00.395
Your doing, Floki?

44:37.640 --> 44:38.915
Want to drown, my friend?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.639
Let me help you.
