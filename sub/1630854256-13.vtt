Hi.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.390
Something quick and fancy.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.292
With gin. And tonic.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.759
But hold the tonic.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.228
Ah...

00:29.130 --> 00:31.565

00:31.665 --> 00:33.000

00:35.136 --> 00:37.905
Sorry, haven't seen either.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.241
Well, I'm pretty sure
that he killed his sister.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.576
Or married her. Or both.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.114

00:58.192 --> 00:59.493
Long Beach.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.731
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

02:51.004 --> 02:51.839
I have a plan.

02:51.939 --> 02:52.706
You need to
write it down.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.141
I did write it down,

02:54.242 --> 02:55.376
and I sent it to you.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.010
You sent me a text
that said I could have

02:57.110 --> 02:59.179
your Leatherman 300
series multi-tool.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.814
Yeah, it means a lot to me.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.283
And you mean
a lot to me,

03:02.383 --> 03:04.017
so if anything happens to me,

03:04.117 --> 03:05.386
it's all yours.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.754
I got a guy.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.422
Of course you got a guy.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.190
He's an estate lawyer.
Best in the city.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.293
That's great 'cause
I don't have an estate.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.661
I barely
have a couch.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.529
G, it's not
just you anymore.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.598
You need to start thinking about
getting your affairs in order.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.899
Affairs in order? What, is there

03:18.999 --> 03:20.301
a hit out on me
that I don't know about?

03:20.401 --> 03:21.535
I mean, should
I be concerned?

03:21.635 --> 03:22.570
Let's see how you do
at target practice,

03:22.670 --> 03:23.704
then I'll
let you know.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.772
Why don't you
write this down:

03:24.872 --> 03:26.740
Now Deeks gets the Leatherman.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.479
All right, man, it's your loss.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.813
There's definitely
a cow involved.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.282
Maybe it was
three cows.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.449
I mean,
it could've been

03:35.549 --> 03:36.917
seven cows.
Oh, my gosh, Deeks,

03:37.017 --> 03:38.452
cut to the chase. What
happened with the cows?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.487
I don't remember what
happened with the cows.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.521
I was 15,
I don't remember.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.622
What I do remember, though,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.491
is that
I came home way,

03:43.591 --> 03:44.858
way past curfew.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.894
Wait, how much
past curfew?

03:46.994 --> 03:47.728
Two days.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.397
Oh. Okay, you know what?

03:49.497 --> 03:50.664
Doesn't matter.

03:50.764 --> 03:51.899
Teenage boys
are a different breed.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.302
Rosa will never,
ever do that to us.

03:54.402 --> 03:57.705
How dare you gender profile
pubescent indiscretions.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.172
What are you...
What are you telling me here,

03:59.273 --> 04:00.474
that you never
broke curfew?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.009
Uh, considering
that I was homeless

04:02.109 --> 04:03.611
for a good part
of my teenage years,

04:03.711 --> 04:05.045
no, I didn't.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.947
Ouch. Gonna hit me
with the real real.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.416
Well, you know what?
There was this one time, though.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.517
Go on.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.518
It was before

04:10.618 --> 04:11.685
my dad died. Right.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.754
I was about 14 years old or so,

04:13.854 --> 04:17.190
and I convinced him to
let me and my friend, uh,

04:17.291 --> 04:18.526
stay out a little later

04:18.626 --> 04:20.027
to go see
Third Eye Blind play live.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.162
Oh, classic '90s.
So what'd you really do?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.797
Keg stand? Drag race?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.299
Did you at least sneak some
smokes behind the Piggly Wiggly?

04:25.399 --> 04:27.100
Ew. Ew. No, of course not.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.303
We went to the concert,
and we just got home late.

04:29.403 --> 04:30.804
That's no fun.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.406
No, but the backstage passes
we stole certainly were.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.942
Oh, my God, it's all teenagers.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.378
See? Every last,
shifty one of them.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.679
That is my point.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.780
You know what?
That settles it.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.014
I don't care. 9:00 p.m. curfew.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.149
Definitely.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.250
Indefinitely.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.285
Indefinitely...

04:45.386 --> 04:47.588
We're gonna be
such good parents.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.627
Yo. There you are.
I've been looking for you.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.895
Hey. Really?

04:54.995 --> 04:56.229
I didn't see you
come in this morning.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.031
How's it going?
That's a loaded question.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.933
Everything okay?

05:00.033 --> 05:01.369
For now.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.771
Okay, what's with
the vaguebooking, Tree?

05:03.871 --> 05:05.739
Have you ever heard
of the ARkStorm?

05:05.839 --> 05:09.677
Uh, is that the new retro club
in the Fashion District?

05:09.777 --> 05:11.679
No, it's the
catastrophic rain storm

05:11.779 --> 05:12.913
that's headed
towards LA.

05:13.013 --> 05:13.981
I heard about it
on the news

05:14.081 --> 05:15.315
on my way in
this morning.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.351
Oh, it sounds scary.
How long have we got?

05:17.451 --> 05:18.719
Anywhere between
five months

05:18.819 --> 05:20.788
and, like, five decades.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.891
Perfect, just enough time
to, uh, solve our case.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.926
Hey, got your text. Who is this?

05:26.026 --> 05:28.829
Well, say hello
to Sean Baker.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.464
Hello, Sean Baker.
To what do we owe the pleasure?

05:30.564 --> 05:33.100
Yeah, pleasure's not really
the word I would use.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.903
Baker was attacked yesterday
at the York Park Hotel

05:36.003 --> 05:37.538
where he's been staying
for the past few weeks.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.106
Is he alive?
Barely.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.841
The attacker sent
Baker over a railing.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.210
He flew 20 feet
to the lobby floor below.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.479
He's been in surgery
ever since this morning.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.080
What's his
connection to us?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.249
Well, he's the co-founder
of Almaya Technautics,

05:49.349 --> 05:51.819
an L.A.-based artificial
intelligence start-up

05:51.919 --> 05:53.387
which has an exclusive

05:53.487 --> 05:55.055
contract with the Navy.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.323
Well, if the company's
based in LA,

05:56.424 --> 05:57.290
why was he staying in a hotel?

05:57.391 --> 05:58.726
Good question,

05:58.826 --> 06:00.428
because the address
on his driver's license

06:00.528 --> 06:01.695
doesn't appear to be current.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.130
What do we know
about the company?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.832
Well, most recently,
they've been developing

06:04.932 --> 06:07.134
autonomous military
agents equipped for

06:07.234 --> 06:08.769
search and rescue operations
on the battlefield.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.871
So... robots.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.106
That's another way to put it.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.108
If these robots
have the ability

06:15.208 --> 06:16.644
to track our
soldiers on the ground,

06:16.744 --> 06:18.812
an enemy could co-opt
that same technology

06:18.912 --> 06:20.113
and use it to
find them first.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.550
Or reprogram them
to hunt and kill.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.919
I'm starting to think that an
ARkStorm doesn't sound so bad.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.091
Cameras were down in
the area during the attack,

06:31.191 --> 06:32.693
but, according to witnesses,

06:32.793 --> 06:34.428
we're looking for this woman.

06:35.996 --> 06:36.997
Unfortunately, facial rec

06:37.097 --> 06:38.432
hasn't gotten any hits,

06:38.532 --> 06:40.901
so Kilbride wants us

06:41.001 --> 06:42.470
to find out who she is

06:42.570 --> 06:45.272
and make sure that Baker's tech
hasn't been compromised.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.740
All right, we'll take
the crime scene.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.275
Have Kensi and
Deeks reach out

06:48.375 --> 06:49.510
to Baker's company.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.578
And let's start
digging into Baker,

06:50.678 --> 06:52.079
see if anything sticks out

06:52.179 --> 06:53.481
in the days
leading up to his attack.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.982
You got it.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.218
Yo, speaking of Kilbride,

06:58.318 --> 06:59.219
where is he?

06:59.319 --> 07:00.754
Uh, I don't know.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.756
He sent me everything via
encrypted message this morning.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.958
Huh. You don't think he's
in trouble again, do you?

07:31.552 --> 07:33.220
Ooh.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.188
Who did your decorating,

07:35.288 --> 07:36.990
Marie Kondo?

07:37.090 --> 07:38.559
Elizabeth, you're still here.

07:38.659 --> 07:42.730
Oh, well, I found these
in the, uh, backyard,

07:42.830 --> 07:44.164
and I thought, you know,

07:44.264 --> 07:45.866
they could liven up
the place a little bit.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.669
You hate daisies.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.137
Oh, you remembered.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.873
Too bad you didn't
remember our anniversary.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.407
Maybe we wouldn't
have gotten divorced

07:54.508 --> 07:56.076
30 years ago.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.946
No, I'm kidding.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.013
It was your temper.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.114
I have to get to the office.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.783
Oh, so soon? I was going to

08:02.883 --> 08:04.852
make us breakfast,
but I kind of gave up

08:04.952 --> 08:07.487
expired cans of Vienna
sausage for lent.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.490
There's a diner right
down the street.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.260
I'm sure you'll find
something there that you like.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.797
Last night was fun, wasn't it?

08:21.201 --> 08:23.036
Last night was something.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.975
Now, there's that
poker face I married.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.843
Yeah, come to think of it,

08:29.943 --> 08:32.312
that might have had something
to do with the divorce, too.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.951
Why are you here, Elizabeth?

08:38.051 --> 08:40.721
I told you, I came in
early for a conference,

08:40.821 --> 08:43.123
and asked you for
drinks last night

08:43.223 --> 08:45.325
so that we could
catch up, and...

08:45.425 --> 08:48.662
Well, I didn't expect us
to catch up so much.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.997
Nice try,

08:50.097 --> 08:51.732
but I have been able
to read your face

08:51.832 --> 08:53.667
since you were 25 years old.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.402
I know you want something.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.206
What I want...

09:00.674 --> 09:02.876
...is to take a shower.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.882
There are towels in the closet.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.084
Lock the door on your way out.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.111
Baker must have spent

09:38.211 --> 09:39.647
a ton of money
to stay here.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.683
Rooms in a place like this
do not come cheap.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.484
That's 'cause you don't
pay for the room,

09:44.584 --> 09:45.819
you pay for the experience.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.488
It's just a room, it's
not a spiritual journey.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.923
You're right.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.492
Spiritual journey's part
of the upgrade package.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.395
What did you find out?

09:55.495 --> 09:56.563
An employee
said the attacker

09:56.664 --> 09:58.198
escaped through
a stairwell.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.667
Said she was
carrying a suitcase.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.401
LAPD confirmed
it was Baker's.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.303
Did the cameras
pick up anything?

10:03.403 --> 10:05.038
Caught her exiting
into the alley.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.907
Lost her when
she hit the streets.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.876
Well, Fatima's
checking traffic cams.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.610
Hopefully she can
pick up her trail.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.047
G, this woman
is good.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.515
Maybe too good.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.950
Did you, uh, see this?

10:17.050 --> 10:17.985
Blood marks.

10:18.085 --> 10:18.986
Attack started here.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.788
Goes all the way
back here.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.093
That's pretty far from
where Baker went over.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.427
Yeah.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.763
It was quite a fight.

10:29.863 --> 10:30.731
Yeah.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.299
So either
the attacker

10:32.399 --> 10:33.967
took one too many
kickboxing classes...

10:34.067 --> 10:37.070
Or we're looking
for a professional.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.044
Thank you for
joining us, Mr. Greene.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.714
Call me Clyde.
Is Sean going to be okay?

10:46.814 --> 10:48.081
Uh, he's not out
of the woods yet,

10:48.181 --> 10:50.751
but the last update
we got sounds promising.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.953
His mother's
going to kill me.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.756
Sean and I have
been friends forever.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.558
She blames me for everything
bad that happens to him.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.827
Do bad things
happen to him often?

10:59.927 --> 11:01.228
We got into some trouble
when we were kids,

11:01.328 --> 11:02.529
but nothing major,
just typical

11:02.629 --> 11:03.964
teenager stuff,
you know...

11:04.064 --> 11:06.199
Cows, Third Eye Blind.
No, we definitely get it.

11:07.534 --> 11:08.869
What's Third Eye Blind?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.637
How dare you.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.705
Not important.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.874
But that was
a long time ago.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.508
We started our company
from our dorm room together.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.311
We've been all about
the work ever since.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.512
Things were slow at first,

11:19.612 --> 11:20.814
so the company took a back seat

11:20.914 --> 11:22.682
while we built up our résumés,

11:22.783 --> 11:24.584
but that all changed
about a year ago.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.219
What happened a year ago?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.388
Suddenly everybody wanted
to get their hands on AI.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.390
That tracks. Same timeline
as the invasion of Ukraine.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.425
It was a wake-up call for
militaries all over the world.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.526
Tech companies, too.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.728
The competition's steep,

11:34.828 --> 11:35.996
but we were lucky to land

11:36.096 --> 11:37.865
our sole source contract
with the Navy.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.132
If your company is here in L.A.,

11:39.232 --> 11:40.734
why was Baker
staying at a hotel?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.269
He lives out of them.
Changes it up

11:42.369 --> 11:44.671
every few weeks. Does the same
thing with hobbies.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.340
Says he finds
consistency to be suffocating.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.276
That totally makes sense.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.543
What?

11:50.643 --> 11:53.480
What? Variety is
the hot spice of life.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.784
Is there anyone you can

11:56.884 --> 11:58.618
think of that might
want to hurt him?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.420
No.
Nobody?

12:00.520 --> 12:01.855
No one.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.091
Look, uh, things have
been a little chaotic

12:04.191 --> 12:06.026
at the office,
given what happened.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.761
Would you mind if...

12:07.861 --> 12:08.862
Please.
Go, go, go.
We will

12:08.962 --> 12:10.030
let you know
if anything changes.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.164
Yeah.
Thank you.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.838
So, lifetime friends
turned partners.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.240
Looks like we're
not the only ones

12:20.340 --> 12:21.574
mixing business and pleasure.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.976
Yeah, but the only thing
I ever started

12:23.076 --> 12:26.246
out of my dorm room
was a hot plate fire.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.282
What's a hot plate?

12:29.382 --> 12:30.750
What's a
hot plate?

12:32.152 --> 12:33.186
What do we got?

12:34.487 --> 12:35.722
Sir, you're okay.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.390
Uh, are you okay?

12:37.490 --> 12:38.525
Well, considering that

12:38.625 --> 12:40.593
I have been forced to live out

12:40.693 --> 12:42.996
my so-called golden years

12:43.096 --> 12:45.833
in this overly triggered,

12:45.933 --> 12:47.634
insecurity blanket of a town,

12:47.734 --> 12:48.768
the answer is no,

12:48.869 --> 12:51.371
Agent Namazi,
I am never okay.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.974
Noted, but not what I meant.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.475
I was worried
when you didn't

12:55.575 --> 12:56.643
show up this morning.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.778
Oh, well,
I appreciate the concern.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.080
What I do not appreciate

13:00.180 --> 13:02.950
is being forced to
beg for a sitrep.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.217
Of course.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.287
Are you sure you're okay?

13:09.189 --> 13:10.490
Right.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.160
Okay, so, I was able to
reach our contact at ONR,

13:13.260 --> 13:15.262
who's been overseeing
Baker's project.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.964
Their systems
are on alert

13:17.064 --> 13:18.131
and ready
to intercept

13:18.231 --> 13:19.566
any potential cyberattacks.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.069
Good. What about
Sean Baker himself?

13:23.170 --> 13:24.604
Guess who got
access to his

13:24.704 --> 13:26.073
bank accounts?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.708
Admiral, you're here.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.077
And you're okay.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.250
Is there something
different about you today?

13:38.785 --> 13:40.487
I got highlights.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.755
Proceed, Agent Rountree.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.357
Yes, sir.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.727
So, this is actually
pretty interesting.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.130
Baker has been
making payments

13:50.230 --> 13:53.233
to an art gallery downtown
for the past three months.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.069
Maybe he's got
a thing for still lifes.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.771
But he doesn't have
a thing for consistency.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.807
His partner told
Kensi and Deeks

14:00.908 --> 14:02.509
that Baker
doesn't do anything

14:02.609 --> 14:04.111
for more than
a few weeks at a time.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.813
Well, then I agree,
this is interesting.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.149
Get a warrant, have Kensi
and Deeks check it out.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.617
Yes, sir.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.298
All right, thanks.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.633
Hey, buddy.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.401
Nope, no need.
I know why you're here.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.037
Get a hit on the prints yet?

14:30.837 --> 14:32.072
Excuse me?

14:32.172 --> 14:33.573
Fingerprints.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.642
Got to be all over this place,
right? You get a hit yet?

14:35.742 --> 14:36.944
I heard what you said.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.345
Why don't you let me
ask the questions, okay?

14:38.445 --> 14:39.746
Yeah, yeah.
You work here
last night?

14:39.846 --> 14:41.314
Uh, yeah, yeah,
until those two perps

14:41.414 --> 14:42.549
took off without paying.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.650
Or was it one perp?

14:43.750 --> 14:44.751
How-how many perps
we looking at?

14:44.851 --> 14:45.785
Stop saying "perps."
Sorry.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.853
Just, I've been researching

14:46.954 --> 14:48.288
crime a lot lately.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.689
For my screenplay.

14:49.789 --> 14:50.657
Actually, if you ever
wanted to take a look...

14:50.757 --> 14:51.824
I'm not much
for reading.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.160
Or writing things down.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.462
LAPD found this
in Baker's hotel room.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.829
Laptop still inside.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.231
What can you tell me
about this woman?

14:58.331 --> 15:00.968
Uh, she was only here
a few minutes.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.536
She said something about
flying back to Virginia.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.305
Anyway, she sat down right there

15:05.405 --> 15:07.440
and she immediately started
flirting with our John Doe.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.944
He's not our John Doe.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.412
He's not even a John Doe.

15:13.713 --> 15:14.647
Is this the guy
she was talking to?

15:14.747 --> 15:15.882
Uh, yeah, yeah,
that's him.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.217
He got pretty upset

15:17.317 --> 15:18.751
when he noticed
his bag was gone, too.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.422
She must have been
targeting Baker all night.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.691
Okay, so she waits, finds a time
where she can distract him

15:24.791 --> 15:26.193
long enough to sneak away
with his suitcase.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.328
Before she get away,
he catches up with her.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.831
And we all know how
that ended. Mm-mm-mmm.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.701
Sorry.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.938
Question is,

15:39.039 --> 15:41.308
what was in that suitcase
that was so important to him?

15:44.577 --> 15:46.246
We might have a way to find out.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.086
What is that,
one of those smart tags?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.055
Yeah, you put it in
a wallet or a purse,

15:55.155 --> 15:56.990
anything you don't want
to lose track of.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.091
Well, considering
the way

15:58.191 --> 15:59.392
he fought to get
that bag back...

15:59.492 --> 16:00.493
It might mean

16:00.593 --> 16:01.894
he put a tracker in it

16:01.995 --> 16:03.063
so he wouldn't lose it
in the first place.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.137
Wow, look at
this workspace.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.371
Well, it doesn't
really look like

16:11.471 --> 16:13.406
he's been getting
any actual work done.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.541
Huh, which is weird

16:14.641 --> 16:15.808
why he keeps
paying for it,

16:15.908 --> 16:17.644
considering his
nomadic lifestyle.

16:17.744 --> 16:18.945
Well, maybe he's waiting

16:19.046 --> 16:19.912
for inspiration to strike.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.114
Yeah, that's
his mistake,

16:21.214 --> 16:22.249
because you
should never wait

16:22.349 --> 16:23.450
for inspiration
to strike,

16:23.550 --> 16:24.717
you should
go after it.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.785
Well, you can tell that
to Salvador Dali,

16:25.885 --> 16:27.020
'cause you know
what they say?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.821
They say that his
famous melting clocks

16:28.921 --> 16:30.357
was actually based on
a block of Camembert

16:30.457 --> 16:32.092
that was left in
the sun for too long.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.960
Uh, quick question.
Who's "they," exactly?

16:34.061 --> 16:36.163
Uh, historians
and scholars.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.198
Maybe I read it
on a Snapple cap.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.100
My point is that
art can be found

16:40.200 --> 16:42.001
in the most
unlikely of places.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.836
Like a box full of
wide-eyed dolls?

16:43.936 --> 16:45.238
I said art,
not nightmares.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.506
Oh, Daddy,

16:46.606 --> 16:48.241
I love you.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.942
Okay, now I know
what I'm gonna be talking about

16:50.043 --> 16:51.211
in therapy this week.
You don't go to therapy.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.245
I do now.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.213
Hold on a second.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.414
I feel something in here. Knife?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.049
Yeah.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.786
Right there?
Yeah.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.058
What do you got?

17:05.158 --> 17:07.260
Oh, man.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.330
Is that a microchip?

17:10.430 --> 17:13.066
"AT-4756."

17:13.166 --> 17:14.067
A-T.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.002
What was Baker's company name?

17:16.103 --> 17:17.870
Almaya Technautics.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.510
Deeks, it's
in all of them.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.712
So, maybe this was never about

17:25.812 --> 17:26.979
gaining access
to Baker's robots.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.148
Maybe this
whole time,

17:28.248 --> 17:29.582
Baker has been secretly

17:29.682 --> 17:32.152
selling the microchips
that are running them.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.665
Why do
I feel guilty

17:45.765 --> 17:47.100
about what
we just did?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.001
Why do I feel like their
eyes are still watching me?

17:49.102 --> 17:51.204
And why do I feel like
I'm listening to a reboot

17:51.304 --> 17:52.339
of <i>Child's Play?</i>

17:52.439 --> 17:53.706
Fatima, what do you got?

17:53.806 --> 17:54.807
Looks like these
microchips all appear to be

17:54.907 --> 17:56.075
field-programmable gate arrays.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.777
Oh, I've always,
uh, preferred

17:57.877 --> 17:59.579
the purple frost
flavor myself.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.549
Gate arrays.
Not Gatorade.
Oh. Oh.

18:02.649 --> 18:03.950
As you know,
these semiconductors

18:04.050 --> 18:05.652
are the brains
of most technology.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.521
But, unlike ASIC chips,
which are designed for

18:08.621 --> 18:10.157
one specific purpose,

18:10.257 --> 18:12.325
FPGA's are customizable.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.526
Meaning they can
be repurposed

18:13.626 --> 18:15.195
for all different
types of technology.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.498
Everything from dishwashers
to Baker's autonomous robots.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.300
So does that mean that
they can be reprogrammed

18:20.400 --> 18:21.468
to work in weapons

18:21.568 --> 18:22.602
like drones
and cruise missiles?

18:22.702 --> 18:23.970
Yes, that's why

18:24.070 --> 18:25.872
companies are prohibited
from exporting them

18:25.972 --> 18:28.141
to enemy countries
like Russia or China,

18:28.241 --> 18:31.444
who are desperate to get
their hands on them.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.812
Which means that
those countries

18:32.912 --> 18:34.347
could probably
be willing to pay

18:34.447 --> 18:36.749
a hefty sum to
remedy that problem.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.485
And if that's true,
it looks like Baker's

18:38.585 --> 18:40.086
been taking them up
on that offer.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.021
I'll get in touch
with his partner again,

18:42.121 --> 18:43.256
see if we can find out
how many more

18:43.356 --> 18:44.924
are unaccounted for.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.826
Yo, Callen, Sam.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.060
What do you got, Rountree?

18:48.161 --> 18:49.196
We got a warrant to access

18:49.296 --> 18:50.363
the iCloud account

18:50.463 --> 18:51.864
that was attached to the laptop

18:51.964 --> 18:53.800
you guys found
in Baker's messenger bag.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.502
I'm still searching through
the texts and emails.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.603
It looks like
everything's above board.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.004
Yeah, this guy's made a career

18:58.104 --> 18:59.206
working in technology.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.173
He would never
do anything illegal

19:00.273 --> 19:01.341
on his personal devices.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.042
He's way too smart for that.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.845
Well, luckily so is
his luggage. You were right.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.114
Everything this guy owned
seems to be linked to

19:08.215 --> 19:09.882
its own app, including one

19:09.982 --> 19:13.253
for a ridiculously
expensive smart suitcase.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.723
You don't pay for the suitcase,
you pay for the experience.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.759
Were you able to get
a location on it?

19:19.859 --> 19:21.060
It's been all over the city,

19:21.160 --> 19:22.862
Looks like it recently
stopped moving

19:22.962 --> 19:24.497
in a parking lot downtown.
I'm sending you the address now.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.865
Thanks, Rountree.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.534
No, I will not calm down.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.970
I am currently dealing with
a matter of national security.

19:31.070 --> 19:34.741
I not only have the Secretary
of the United States Navy

19:34.841 --> 19:36.175
breathing down my neck,

19:36.276 --> 19:40.480
I also have ONR texting
me four-letter words

19:40.580 --> 19:42.749
that would make
George Carlin blush.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.151
Now, I can barely commit
to a cup of coffee,

19:45.252 --> 19:47.754
and you actually expect
me to commit to dinner?

19:47.854 --> 19:48.988
And dessert.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.490
Where do you
keep your Bundt pan?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.392
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.060
Are you back in my house?

19:54.160 --> 19:55.362
Darling, I never left.

19:55.462 --> 19:58.164
But I did have some,
uh, groceries delivered.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.432
Mostly leafy greens

19:59.532 --> 20:01.000
and walnuts, oatmeal.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.969
Well, the last time I checked,
I was not a squirrel,

20:03.069 --> 20:05.538
so I won't be
needing any of that.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.006
Hollace, I'm worried
about your heart.

20:07.106 --> 20:10.142
There's a first time
for everything.

20:11.478 --> 20:14.281
You know, I hate
to admit it, but...

20:14.381 --> 20:15.948
I've missed our fights.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.151
This wouldn't
even make the top 20.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.587
Oh.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.721
You remember that time
in, uh, Atlantic City,

20:21.821 --> 20:22.889
at the Tropicana?

20:22.989 --> 20:24.424
Oh, how could I forget?

20:24.524 --> 20:27.894
You stabbed me in the thigh
with a king crab leg.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.430
But we did manage

20:30.530 --> 20:31.698
to make up

20:31.798 --> 20:33.866
before the elevator
got to the lobby.

20:33.966 --> 20:37.670
Yeah, two times,
if I remember correctly.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.308
Uh, yeah, look, I've got to go.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.909
I've got a case to solve.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.211
Yeah, and I have
a dinner to prepare.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.279
See you later.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.318
Sir? Are you in
the middle of something?

20:51.418 --> 20:52.752
Well, I was just about

20:52.852 --> 20:54.621
to break my record
at Wordle,

20:54.721 --> 20:56.255
but for you,
I will take a break.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.824
Walk and talk, Agent Namazi.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.759
Walk and talk.
Yes, sir.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.027
So, I checked
every flight

21:01.127 --> 21:02.762
from here to
the D.C. metro area.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.431
So far,
no one matches

21:04.531 --> 21:05.998
the description
of Baker's attacker.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.635
Well, she nearly killed
a government contractor,

21:08.735 --> 21:11.571
and potentially made off
with God knows how many

21:11.671 --> 21:13.773
military-grade microchips,

21:13.873 --> 21:15.475
so I wouldn't expect honesty

21:15.575 --> 21:17.009
to be her strong suit.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.812
Yeah, speaking of, uh,
the Navy confirmed that all

21:19.912 --> 21:21.914
23 microchips that we
found at Baker's studio

21:22.014 --> 21:24.717
were manufactured
by Almaya Technautics.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.586
I'm just having
a hard time finding out

21:26.686 --> 21:27.920
how many more
are unaccounted for.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.389
Well, what
about Baker's partner?

21:29.489 --> 21:30.523
What does he have to say?

21:30.623 --> 21:31.891
I can't locate him.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.393
And nobody
at the company

21:33.493 --> 21:35.428
will talk without his approval.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.096
Then may I suggest that you

21:37.196 --> 21:39.599
stop telling me things
that you don't know,

21:39.699 --> 21:41.668
and come find me when
there are actually

21:41.768 --> 21:43.336
things that you do know.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.105
Tough crowd.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.509
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

21:49.609 --> 21:52.244
an atmospheric river could
wipe out the whole Southland

21:52.345 --> 21:53.813
any moment now,

21:53.913 --> 21:56.082
and he won't remember
any of this.

21:56.182 --> 21:57.784
It doesn't.

21:59.185 --> 22:02.021
Listen, if Baker was
trying to sell these

22:02.121 --> 22:04.323
highly restricted microchips,

22:04.424 --> 22:06.359
then he probably had
people lined up to buy them.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.894
And the whole reason
they're restricted

22:07.994 --> 22:08.995
is because they could be used

22:09.095 --> 22:10.697
in hostile drones and missiles.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.332
Right, which means we need to
talk to someone highly skilled

22:13.433 --> 22:14.801
in the weapons trade.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.004
And the pastry trade, too.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.845
You never told me what I get.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.447
What are you
talking about?

22:27.547 --> 22:29.649
Well, you know,
when you head out

22:29.749 --> 22:31.818
to that big math
competition in the sky,

22:31.918 --> 22:33.119
what's in it for me?

22:33.219 --> 22:34.721
In what world
do I go first?

22:34.821 --> 22:35.922
You think the sixth
food group is "fast."

22:36.022 --> 22:38.224
I think that still
waters run deep.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.759
You keep a lot of
things bottled up,

22:39.859 --> 22:41.060
that's gonna catch
up to you one of these days.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.662
Yeah, well, hopefully
we catch up with, uh,

22:42.762 --> 22:44.764
Baker's business partner
before it does.

22:44.864 --> 22:45.798
What the hell
does Clyde Greene

22:45.898 --> 22:46.766
have to do
with this?

22:46.866 --> 22:48.334
Well, he's right there.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.335
And he's gonna run.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.270
Hey, federal agents.

22:52.439 --> 22:53.673
Told you.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.353
This is the end
of the road, Greene.

23:09.355 --> 23:11.858
Hope you got your
affairs in order.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.504
Baker's suitcase is empty.

23:24.604 --> 23:27.139
Fatima's gaining access to
the lot's security cameras.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.941
This is all a big misunderstanding.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.242
I see. So you misunderstood

23:30.342 --> 23:31.711
when we said
we were federal agents.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.179
I was scared.

23:33.279 --> 23:35.381
You weren't the same people
I talked to this morning.

23:35.482 --> 23:36.549
So, to be clear,
you thought

23:36.649 --> 23:37.784
there was only two
of us in the city?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.151
Budget cuts are no joke.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.687
Yeah,

23:40.787 --> 23:42.321
you should see what
they're doing to our prisons.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.790
Actually, you're about to.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.391
It's not what you think.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.759
Well, that's a
little presumptuous.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.127
'cause we haven't
told you what we think,

23:48.227 --> 23:49.662
but since you brought it up,

23:49.762 --> 23:51.664
we think that you found out
your partner was doing

23:51.764 --> 23:53.332
a little side hustle,
and he cut you out.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.467
Which pissed you off,

23:54.567 --> 23:56.168
so you put a hit out on him,

23:56.268 --> 23:58.204
and then cashed in
on everything.

23:58.304 --> 23:59.539
No. No way.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.608
I didn't hire
anyone to kill anybody.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.644
None of this
was supposed to happen.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.549
Okay, so what was
supposed to happen?

24:10.449 --> 24:12.619
With the supply chain shortage
'cause of Covid,

24:12.719 --> 24:14.587
the world's desperate for
the microchips we're making.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.356
But your contract with
the Navy has exclusivity

24:17.456 --> 24:19.225
so you can't
sell to anyone else.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.893
Which is why we did
a few side deals.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.863
We only sold a few.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.565
On the dark web.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.634
Sean got greedy,
put out an ad for more.

24:27.734 --> 24:30.369
How many more?
200.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.606
He had them all
at the bar with him.

24:33.706 --> 24:34.974
He was there to meet the buyer,

24:35.074 --> 24:36.643
but he was attacked
before they arrived.

24:36.743 --> 24:37.677
That's because there
was no buyer.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.979
You... You guys were set up.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.881
And now there's enough
of your chips out in the wind

24:41.981 --> 24:43.983
to power an enemy's
entire arsenal.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.953
Which means your charge
just went up to treason.

24:51.390 --> 24:52.759
<i>Come on, you can do this.</i>

24:57.129 --> 24:58.364
I don't know.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.232
Horseradish?

25:00.332 --> 25:02.468
Yes. Yes, it's crazy, right?

25:02.569 --> 25:03.770
And all it took
was a little gin.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.905
Wow. I don't even taste the gin.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.506
Oh, no, no, no,
you wouldn't.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.142
I was drinking it when
I came up with the idea.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.443
Um, you know what?

25:11.544 --> 25:13.412
Excuse me
for a second.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.414
Would you...
get on out of here.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.183
Sorry to interrupt.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.517
Ah, don't worry about it.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.086
I was just having a little fun

25:20.186 --> 25:22.722
with those not-so-soggy
bottoms over here.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.558
Carry the two...
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

25:25.658 --> 25:26.893
that was...
that was offensive. Yeah.

25:26.993 --> 25:27.960
So, let me guess.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.629
You came all
the way down here

25:29.729 --> 25:31.163
to thank me
for the rugelach

25:31.263 --> 25:32.464
I sent you
for Hanukkah.

25:32.565 --> 25:35.001
No, but truly, what
a mitzvah, huh?

25:35.101 --> 25:36.302
They were delicious.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.004
We actually
need your help.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.772
You should really consider
a punch card at this point,

25:39.872 --> 25:42.675
like buy nine arms dealers,
get the tenth for free.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.111
Do you happen to
know who she is?

25:45.211 --> 25:47.113
Girl boss, love to see that,

25:47.213 --> 25:50.316
but, uh, I don't know her.
What's her deal?

25:50.416 --> 25:52.018
We think, uh, <i>La Femme Nikita</i>
here is in the wind

25:52.118 --> 25:54.086
with about 200 stolen
military-grade microchips.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.555
Yeah, well, it was only
a matter of time.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.591
Those little devils
are shaping up to be

25:58.691 --> 25:59.859
the future of arms deals.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.327
I mean, I haven't worked
with them myself,

26:01.427 --> 26:03.863
but I might
know someone who has.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.464
Do you know where she's from?

26:05.564 --> 26:08.100
Uh, we're thinking
somewhere in the South,

26:08.200 --> 26:10.436
but hoping that you
could find out for sure.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.038
Hmm.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.340
And, uh, what do I get
for my troubles?

26:14.440 --> 26:15.441
I will do everything in my power

26:15.541 --> 26:17.276
to secure you
a, uh, invite

26:17.376 --> 26:19.045
to the next company barbecue.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.413
Ooh. Isn't he a mensch?

26:21.513 --> 26:23.482
So excited.

26:29.722 --> 26:30.522
Hey.

26:30.623 --> 26:31.490
Hey.
Perfect timing.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.491
Follow me.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.860
Did you get access

26:33.960 --> 26:35.194
to the parking lot
security footage yet?

26:35.294 --> 26:36.595
Yeah, and
it wasn't easy.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.664
They wanted $10 for
the first 15 minutes,

26:37.764 --> 26:39.632
$20 for
the whole day.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.835
Wow, really tough
crowd today.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.504
Anyway, I, uh,
isolated the footage

26:45.604 --> 26:47.106
to the same time
stamp we got

26:47.206 --> 26:48.307
from Baker's
tracking app

26:48.407 --> 26:50.209
and I found this.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.543
That's the woman from the hotel.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.913
Yeah, and still no ID.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.515
But Kensi and Deeks
are working with Nina Barnes

26:56.615 --> 26:57.616
to see if we can change that.

26:57.717 --> 26:58.785
Whoever she is,
she has to know

26:58.885 --> 27:00.052
we're on to her.
I mean, there's

27:00.152 --> 27:01.688
no way she's sticking
around much longer.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.090
This video is
from two hours ago.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.325
She could be on her way to
the Mexican border by now.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.927
She definitely
made a wrong turn.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.796
Kaleidoscope just
got a hit on her SUV.

27:09.896 --> 27:13.099
Looks like she just exited
the 405 North at Victory.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.400
She's in Van Nuys.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.768
There's a private
airfield out there.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.436
Can't be more than
two miles from the exit.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.871
Alert TSA and
Air Traffic Control.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.572
No planes in and out
of that airspace.

27:20.673 --> 27:21.941
You got it.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.816
She's like a walking
Rosetta Stone.

27:29.916 --> 27:32.484
Yeah, with the gravitas
of a Fellini film.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.590
...Phil Collins.

27:39.558 --> 27:40.459
Phil Collins.

27:40.559 --> 27:41.728
<i>Bene.</i>

27:41.828 --> 27:43.930
<i>Grazie.
Grazie.</i>

27:44.030 --> 27:45.031
<i>Ciao bella.</i>

27:45.131 --> 27:45.998
Sorry,

27:46.098 --> 27:47.399
my Italian's a little rusty.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.735
Did you just track down
an organized criminal

27:48.835 --> 27:50.636
or is Genesis reuniting?

27:50.737 --> 27:52.171
Oh, God, I wish.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.740
Those British bad boys
got me through grad school.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.441
Tell me more.
Let's just say

27:55.541 --> 27:56.575
that my contact

27:56.675 --> 27:58.310
once mistook a German gunrunner

27:58.410 --> 28:00.279
for Sir Collins himself.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.447
Okay, do you have
a name for us?

28:01.547 --> 28:03.215
Yeah, Paulina Kaminska.

28:03.315 --> 28:07.353
Kaminska. Is that,
uh, Appalachian?
What?

28:07.453 --> 28:08.587
Polish, I think.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.756
Turns out your girl is one half

28:09.856 --> 28:12.024
of a very elusive European duo.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.026
She and her partner
broker deals for everyone

28:14.126 --> 28:16.662
from French royalty
to Irish crime syndicates.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.965
Oh, so she's an equal
opportunity arms broker.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.167
She was. Rumor has it
they had a falling out.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.936
My guy says she got out of
the game a few years ago.

28:24.871 --> 28:27.139
So why get back in now?

28:27.239 --> 28:28.841
I mean, considering how much
people are willing to pay

28:28.941 --> 28:31.944
for those microchips,
I'm guessing money.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.512
But she had to get
her paws on it first,

28:33.612 --> 28:34.680
which is why she
set up Baker and Greene

28:34.781 --> 28:36.182
and stole them.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.317
Hmm.
Look, this woman
has done deals

28:38.417 --> 28:39.752
with some very dangerous people.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.287
She's talented.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.422
And the reason you
couldn't get an ID on her

28:43.522 --> 28:45.758
is because she's
never been caught.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.832
Bring me up to speed.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.666
This is
Paulina Kaminska,

28:54.767 --> 28:55.968
a confirmed
Polish national

28:56.068 --> 28:57.669
and alleged
former arms broker

28:57.770 --> 28:59.071
with contacts
all over the globe.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.706
Meaning if she gets
out of the country,

29:00.807 --> 29:02.208
it's "so long" to her
and those microchips.

29:02.308 --> 29:05.077
And in the meantime,
we will have single-handedly

29:05.177 --> 29:07.213
given one of our
enemies enough power

29:07.313 --> 29:10.316
to start the next major
global conflict.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.417
Which is why

29:11.517 --> 29:12.551
we're doing everything we can

29:12.651 --> 29:13.786
to stop her from leaving.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.521
ATC has grounded
every single flight

29:15.621 --> 29:16.789
in and out of Van Nuys Airport.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.424
And we just
tracked her SUV

29:18.524 --> 29:20.692
to a closed-down night club
on the airfield's perimeter.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.128
She could be trying
to dump the vehicle.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.663
It's only a matter of time
until she realizes

29:24.763 --> 29:26.833
what's going on
and changes course.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.935
Where are Callen and Sam?

29:29.035 --> 29:30.369
Just got here.

29:30.469 --> 29:33.105
We got eyes on Kaminska.
She's got two men with her.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.541
Kensi and Deeks?

29:35.641 --> 29:36.708
Ten minutes until
we get there, sir.

29:36.809 --> 29:37.709
And when we do,
it's <i>arrivederci</i>

29:37.810 --> 29:39.211
to this little
field mouse.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.747
Don't mind him, sir.
He's feeling inspired today.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.616
We don't have time.
She's on the move.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.652
Hang on.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.425
Looks like we got company.

29:53.525 --> 29:54.760
Two more men.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.363
I'm sending you photos.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.200
Got them.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.201
Rountree, go.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.236
Yes, sir.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.739
They're going inside
the club with her.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.109
Gentlemen, what the hell's
going on out there?

30:11.110 --> 30:12.378
She didn't come here to flee.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.914
She's here to make the sale.

30:28.427 --> 30:29.862
I've got one gunman
at the front.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.031
I've got the south side covered.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.665
I got the east side.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.401
Do we have any idea
what we're looking at yet?

30:35.501 --> 30:37.169
I was only able
to ID one of them,

30:37.269 --> 30:38.504
but luckily he's the only
one that matters.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.239
His name is Anton Kusev,

30:40.339 --> 30:43.542
former SVR turned very much
wanted Russian arms broker.

30:43.642 --> 30:46.178
And so I very much
don't want you

30:46.278 --> 30:48.047
to let him walk away
with this sale.

30:48.147 --> 30:49.448
Say the word and we'll make sure

30:49.548 --> 30:50.816
they barely walk away at all.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.987
Do we have eyes
on the microchips?

30:56.422 --> 30:58.057
We do now.
So do we have a plan?

30:58.157 --> 30:59.258
I've got an idea.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.292
Well, then,
ladies and gentlemen,

31:00.392 --> 31:01.760
what are you
waiting for?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.562
Start the show.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.547
Kensi, I got one down.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.315
I got him. Go.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.756
Is this the way
to the buffet?

31:40.766 --> 31:42.901
Looks like the buffet is closed.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.276
Hey!

31:56.215 --> 31:57.683
Don't move.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.857
Going somewhere?

32:05.958 --> 32:07.426
Hands on the wheel.

32:16.635 --> 32:19.105
Kusev had a plane waiting
to take him to Ensenada.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.639
We stopped him just in time.

32:20.739 --> 32:22.274
Good job today, everybody.

32:22.374 --> 32:23.909
See what happens
when you have a plan?

32:24.010 --> 32:24.977
We got everybody.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.312
Kensi's inside
doing a final sweep.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.646
Let's eat. Who's hungry?

32:27.746 --> 32:30.416
I could go to town
on some Camembert. Yeah?

32:30.516 --> 32:31.717
I mean, I do have
a few hours left.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.285
A few hours left until what?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.321
Rosa's curfew.
She's got a 9:00 curfew,

32:35.421 --> 32:37.423
so I figured we should probably
be home at the same time.

32:37.523 --> 32:38.757
That's funny.

32:38.857 --> 32:40.459
I remember when
I thought curfews worked.

32:40.559 --> 32:41.960
Yeah, they never stopped me.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.195
Wha... Stop...

32:43.295 --> 32:44.763
Stopped you from
doing what, exactly?

32:44.863 --> 32:46.698
I don't think you want to know.

32:47.666 --> 32:48.900
Guys, we just stopped

32:49.001 --> 32:50.236
a Russian arms dealer

32:50.336 --> 32:52.438
from escaping with these
little Johnny 5's, right?

32:52.538 --> 32:53.872
If we can't reign in a teenager,

32:53.972 --> 32:55.407
I'm pretty sure that
we've got a...

32:55.507 --> 32:57.409
problem. Hold on a second.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.079
Uh, these microchips,
the ones we found before

33:00.179 --> 33:01.980
were inscribed with "AT,"
which is the initials

33:02.081 --> 33:03.215
for Baker's company.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.216
This is... This is blank.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.617
Yo, they all are.

33:10.589 --> 33:11.890
Son of a bitch.

33:11.990 --> 33:12.891
They're fakes.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.593
You guys, go home.
We got this.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.738
Give us a minute.
Yes, sir.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.276
I was hoping I'd
at least get a nap

33:30.376 --> 33:32.044
before you
figured it out.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.513
Where are they?

33:35.314 --> 33:37.916
They're... gone.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.453
I destroyed them.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.824
You don't expect us
to believe that, do you?

33:45.924 --> 33:48.427
I don't expect you to
believe anything I say.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.262
But I'll give you the address.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.397
You can see for yourself.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.232
You were out of the game.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.167
Why go through all this trouble?

33:57.503 --> 33:59.405
I have a cottage back home.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.340
Outside Medyka.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.342
Near eastern border.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.311
Quiet place.

34:05.411 --> 34:06.612
At least it was.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.380
And now it's a crossing point

34:08.480 --> 34:10.582
for thousands
of fleeing refugees.

34:11.850 --> 34:15.053
I've played a part in some
bad things in the past.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.256
Things I can't take back.

34:17.356 --> 34:20.392
Now I have a front row seat
to the realities of them.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.462
Yeah. Karma's a bitch.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.898
So you knew Baker
was making a sale.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.268
And you knew exactly where
the microchips were headed.

34:29.368 --> 34:32.638
Russia, China, Iran.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.541
Doesn't matter
where they're headed.

34:35.641 --> 34:36.642
Wherever their
final destination,

34:36.742 --> 34:38.009
it was never
going to

34:38.110 --> 34:39.578
end well.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.313
So I figure,

34:41.413 --> 34:43.215
what's one last job?

34:44.150 --> 34:45.117
But you did it.

34:45.217 --> 34:46.452
You took them out of play.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.620
Why sell the fake ones?

34:51.323 --> 34:53.525
A girl's got to eat.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.245
Hey, you're back.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.413
How'd it go
out there?

35:14.513 --> 35:15.581
Well, we're all still alive,

35:15.681 --> 35:17.082
so not too bad.

35:17.183 --> 35:18.950
Well, REACT
finished searching

35:19.050 --> 35:20.952
the address
Kaminska gave us.

35:21.052 --> 35:24.022
They recovered all 200
of the real microchips.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.658
Then I change my answer.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.093
Things went pretty
great out there.

35:28.194 --> 35:30.362
Oh, now that's
the classic Rountree

35:30.462 --> 35:31.797
optimism I've
been missing.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.199
Ah, well, you know,

35:33.299 --> 35:35.000
if a natural disaster's
coming for us all,

35:35.100 --> 35:36.968
we might as well enjoy
the good times while they last.

35:37.068 --> 35:40.706
Hmm. Well, if you really want
to enjoy the good times,

35:40.806 --> 35:43.242
there is that new retro club
in the Fashion District

35:43.342 --> 35:45.944
that has our names
written all over it.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.615
Eh, you want to go
to a club right now?

35:49.715 --> 35:50.982
Yeah, before it
gets too crowded.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.818
Or the Big One hits
and knocks it down.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.119
You know, whatever's first.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.587
The Big One?

35:55.687 --> 35:57.356
We'll listen
to the podcast

35:57.456 --> 35:58.590
on the way.
Let's go.

35:58.690 --> 36:01.293
Uh, what's the Big One?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.762
Okay, so,
basically, imagine

36:03.862 --> 36:07.065
everything everywhere
falling down all at once.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.687
I didn't want
the food to get cold.

36:32.591 --> 36:33.959
Sorry I'm late.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.761
Oh.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.163
I was going to text you
a few four-letter words,

36:38.264 --> 36:39.498
but, uh, I figured

36:39.598 --> 36:40.899
you'd heard enough
of that today.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.401
Do you want some wine?

36:43.269 --> 36:45.136
Doctors are saying it's
good for your heart again.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.374
Well, then, I guess you
better pour me a glass

36:48.474 --> 36:50.676
before they change their minds.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.315
Do you know what was

36:56.415 --> 36:58.784
the happiest day
of our marriage?

36:58.884 --> 37:01.353
Yeah, the day your
mother moved away.

37:01.453 --> 37:02.488
Oh,

37:02.588 --> 37:03.822
bite your tongue.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.257
That woman loved you.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.627
Although that was
a close second.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.535
It was the, uh,

37:16.635 --> 37:18.670
the night after
Alexander was born.

37:20.906 --> 37:21.840
We were still in the hospital,

37:21.940 --> 37:24.510
and I was still in pain.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.244
I couldn't sleep.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.914
So you told me that
you wouldn't either.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.749
Even though you
had just gotten back

37:30.849 --> 37:33.018
from... wherever
they had sent you.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.686
Cambodia.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.689
We were in and out in 36 hours.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.860
Yeah, you were exhausted.

37:42.794 --> 37:46.264
So there you were,
holding Alex, and...

37:46.365 --> 37:49.335
fighting like hell
to stay awake for me.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.304
Then you fell asleep.

37:55.974 --> 37:58.844
Now, I may have
been young and...

37:58.944 --> 38:00.546
but I was smart enough to know

38:00.646 --> 38:04.350
that there are very few
certain things in this world.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.655
And seeing the two of you
like that...

38:11.790 --> 38:15.794
I said, "Damn it,
one thing is sure.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.732
That man will always
be there for his boy."

38:29.641 --> 38:31.843
You let me down, Hollace.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.946
But more importantly,

38:35.046 --> 38:37.248
you let Alex down, too.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.089
Should have known
this was coming.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.526
I couldn't talk
about it last night.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.530
I had to make sure
you had changed first.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.565
Alex is an adult.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.834
He made choices,

38:55.934 --> 38:57.903
choices that
left no room for me.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.771
And I tried to help, many times.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.340
But he just cut me
out of his life.

39:02.441 --> 39:06.011
Okay, well, now's your chance
to fight your way back in.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.213
I mean...

39:08.313 --> 39:10.816
The last few years
have been very hard on Alex.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.453
But he's clean now,

39:14.553 --> 39:17.989
and I worry every damn day
that that's gonna change.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.227
And I'm tired of worrying alone.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.800
What do you expect me to do?

39:28.900 --> 39:30.869
He goes to
a treatment program.

39:32.438 --> 39:33.605
It's outpatient,

39:33.705 --> 39:35.607
but he's really
sticking with it.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.810
And they have these family
groups that-that I'm going to,

39:38.910 --> 39:40.446
and...

39:40.546 --> 39:42.748
and I want you to show up.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.283
For him.

39:46.418 --> 39:47.819
He doesn't want me there.

39:47.919 --> 39:48.854
But he needs
you there.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.255
Look, I'm not even saying

39:50.355 --> 39:52.357
you have to jump on
a plane tonight. I...

39:52.458 --> 39:54.292
You don't even have to
give me an answer now.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.494
Just...

39:56.928 --> 39:58.196
Just promise me

39:58.296 --> 40:01.099
that you will think about it.

40:11.677 --> 40:13.044
Fine.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.786
Good.

40:23.989 --> 40:25.657
And now, I didn't cook all day

40:25.757 --> 40:27.459
for you to have this meal cold.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.328
What are we having?

40:32.664 --> 40:34.199
Crab legs.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.503
Do you want some more wine?

40:37.603 --> 40:39.337
No, no, no.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.273
No, I think
I'll switch to Scotch.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.916
Think I'll make it a double.
