08:32.370 --> 08:37.696
And here's the worst part --
you're never gonna have a chance

08:37.764 --> 08:40.899
to tell your mom that I said hello.

09:03.142 --> 09:06.458
Owen: ...And you're fun and I'm
happier when I'm around you

09:06.493 --> 09:07.485
than I am when I'm with Linda.

09:07.605 --> 09:09.060
Lola: "Lola."

[ Alarm beeping ]

09:10.097 --> 09:10.729
Oh! Ugh! Damn!

09:10.764 --> 09:13.731
I <i>really</i> wanted to see where
this was going. Got to go.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.601
Owen: And you're funny, we like
to watch the same TV shows,

09:16.636 --> 09:19.804
and you don't wear those
stupid glasses that she wears.

Lola: What?

09:30.042 --> 09:31.383
I don't get it.

09:31.451 --> 09:33.251
There are no wires?
What?

09:33.287 --> 09:36.187
This button wasn't even
connected to anything.

09:36.223 --> 09:39.128
Or perhaps it was
connected to <i>everything.</i>

09:39.574 --> 09:41.092
<i>Lola: What?</i>

09:41.161 --> 09:42.394
<i>How did -- well, how are you...?</i>

09:42.463 --> 09:44.263
<i>Everything is connected, Lola.</i>

09:44.298 --> 09:47.366
<i>There can be no loose ends.</i>

09:50.870 --> 09:54.305
<i>Maybe everything starts out
connected, and life is about</i>

<i>Valerie: I've realized it now.</i>

09:57.878 --> 09:59.377
<i>I'm in love with you.</i>

09:59.412 --> 10:03.215
<i>But the only way I can express
myself is by doing really weird</i>

10:03.250 --> 10:04.785
<i>things to your mind.</i>

10:04.905 --> 10:06.651
<i>Blake: I know that now.</i>

10:06.720 --> 10:08.970
<i>And I wouldn't have it any other way.</i>

10:10.472 --> 10:11.916
<i>Ugh!</i>

10:12.036 --> 10:14.208
<i>Maybe we all started out connected.</i>

<i>[ Both grunting ]</i>

<i>And we're just trying

10:31.212 --> 10:32.312
<i>N-no, no, no.</i>

10:32.348 --> 10:33.780

<i>It's all right. This is my daughter.</i>
<i>I did this.</i>

10:43.625 --> 10:46.624
<i>Dori: Let me guess -- your wife
sent her to kill you in her place?</i>

10:46.744 --> 10:48.336
<i>Sy: Well, that's exactly right.</i>

10:48.456 --> 10:52.230
<i>Dori: Oh, that reminds me -- I just
needlepointed you a new tweed jacket.</i>
