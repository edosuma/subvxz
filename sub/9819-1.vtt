00:35.567 --> 00:37.771
I'm Kururugi Yuni, 18 years old.

00:39.187 --> 00:41.113
What's wrong, Edou?

00:44.422 --> 00:47.067
Something this small scares me.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.680
Okay, deep breath!

00:52.685 --> 00:54.100
Exhale.

00:55.221 --> 00:58.090
Please split into groups
of 2 for stretches.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.148
Okaaaay~.

01:02.610 --> 01:05.379
Oh, right.. we have an
odd number of people.

01:06.115 --> 01:08.382
You'll be fine alone, right Kururugi-san?

01:09.690 --> 01:10.482
Yes.

01:11.686 --> 01:12.908
I'm Kururugi Yuni,

01:12.916 --> 01:15.710
and something this small hurts me.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.807
Don't put in too much.

01:20.842 --> 01:21.600
Okay.

01:25.563 --> 01:26.650
What happened?

01:26.728 --> 01:27.486
Dustpan!

01:28.081 --> 01:29.758
Suzuki! Are you alright?

01:29.933 --> 01:34.215
Ah, Kururugi.. is fine, right?

01:34.737 --> 01:36.659
Okay, let's head to the infirmary.

01:36.825 --> 01:38.060
It's alright, it's alright.

01:38.063 --> 01:39.411
Please take care of this.

01:39.415 --> 01:40.503
- Get a cloth!
- Okay.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.756
That was scary, hey?

01:42.791 --> 01:44.107
Bring a second one.

01:45.281 --> 01:49.760
Everyone always thinks "Ah, she's fine"

01:50.792 --> 01:52.148
I'm Kururugi Yuni,

01:52.728 --> 01:54.533
and even this.. hurts.

02:02.950 --> 02:04.375
Kururugi's really something.

02:04.410 --> 02:06.437
Her face doesn't change
even with top grade.

02:06.472 --> 02:08.745
She seems like she should be at the top.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.018
Top score really has to be Kururugi-san.

02:11.053 --> 02:12.718
But she's really calm.

02:12.788 --> 02:14.072
She is.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.967
You look super happy, Kururugi.

02:32.966 --> 02:35.186
That cat is your friend, right?

02:36.061 --> 02:38.597
It shares your happiness while you pet it.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.224
So cute.

02:43.855 --> 02:45.144
I mean the cat.

02:45.531 --> 02:47.034
Top grade is getting to her head.

02:47.069 --> 02:48.105
Totally is.

02:48.140 --> 02:50.117
Why is she talking to Sakurai-sensei?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.653
Really ticks me off.

02:52.070 --> 02:53.987
We need to talk - come to
the staff room after class.

02:54.022 --> 02:55.419
She can't even speak English!

02:56.723 --> 02:58.690
Isn't Sakurai-sensei so cool?

02:58.725 --> 03:00.682
- His cologne smells so good.
- An adult's smell!

03:00.684 --> 03:03.143
Sensei, you're so cool!

03:03.471 --> 03:05.184
You're all cuter.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.715
Don't take it seriously.

03:23.110 --> 03:30.707
Close Range Love.

03:48.611 --> 03:51.852
It is in the textbook right around here,

03:53.707 --> 03:56.800
it means something is becoming one's forte.

04:00.982 --> 04:03.332
He asks me to come see him
and then has me wait.

04:03.725 --> 04:05.166
How irresponsible.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.868
What are you mumbling about?

04:09.643 --> 04:11.365
What did you need to talk to me about?

04:11.400 --> 04:14.258
Come to the English classroom
at 4pm after class, every day.

04:19.713 --> 04:24.050
Extra lessons. Your English grade was
the only low one on your midterms.

04:24.186 --> 04:27.392
It's bad for us if a prodigy
like you gets a bad grade.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.918
They'll say things about
me as your teacher.

04:30.987 --> 04:32.211
What's up with you, anyway?

04:32.216 --> 04:33.700
Are you doing it on purpose?

04:33.706 --> 04:35.301
To get my attention.

04:45.322 --> 04:47.993
I understand. Excuse me.

04:56.543 --> 04:57.762
Sakurai-sensei.

05:00.895 --> 05:04.693
Wouldn't every day be a bit much?

05:04.938 --> 05:08.284
She's preparing for exams and
has other things to study.

05:08.319 --> 05:10.730
Akechi-sensei, aren't you her cousin?

05:11.434 --> 05:13.955
Oh, it's not because of that.

05:13.990 --> 05:16.549
Does a math teacher have a
say in her English studies?

05:21.713 --> 05:23.189
You have extra lessons?

05:23.224 --> 05:24.025
Yeah.

05:24.127 --> 05:26.972
That teacher who started
in April, Sakurai-sensei.

05:27.267 --> 05:31.477
He doesn't seem to like that I did
poorly on the English midterm.

05:31.716 --> 05:33.244
So that's why?

05:36.102 --> 05:38.962
You weren't good at English
in middle school, either.

05:39.043 --> 05:41.369
He says it'll be every day after school.

05:41.690 --> 05:43.161
He's too forceful.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.312
I'm.. really mad right now.

05:49.316 --> 05:50.466
She's mad?

05:50.637 --> 05:51.780
Most likely.

05:51.815 --> 05:54.789
She always wants donuts when she's angry.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.587
Isn't it unusual to eat sweets when mad?

05:58.504 --> 06:00.420
It's not that strange.

06:00.455 --> 06:02.302
Anger releases adrenaline.

06:02.337 --> 06:04.636
Sweets, basically just
sugar, make up for it.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.519
Nami-chan, who is this?

06:11.615 --> 06:13.138
You just noticed me?

06:13.352 --> 06:16.580
Satou Saki-kun from my class.

06:21.302 --> 06:22.459
Hello.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.976
Is he your new boyfriend?

06:29.258 --> 06:30.512
That's the gist of it.

06:32.879 --> 06:34.194
Nice to meet you.

06:34.968 --> 06:37.543
Nami-chan, I'm going to go home
by myself starting tomorrow.

06:37.578 --> 06:38.676
What, why?

06:38.711 --> 06:40.096
Well, there's the lessons.

06:40.515 --> 06:44.216
But it's also hard to go home with
you when we're in different classes.

06:44.264 --> 06:46.302
Yuni, why are you saying this so suddenly?

06:48.019 --> 06:50.693
Ohhh, are you trying to make room for Saki?

06:50.728 --> 06:52.164
If so, don't worry about it.

06:52.165 --> 06:54.044
He says we should all go together.

06:54.079 --> 06:55.923
It's not that I'm thinking about him.

06:55.925 --> 06:59.660
I'd feel bad making you wait
for my lessons to finish.

07:01.051 --> 07:02.105
Yuni..

07:04.083 --> 07:05.159
Alright.

07:05.453 --> 07:07.573
But lunch time doesn't change!

07:08.436 --> 07:09.637
Nami-chan..

07:10.676 --> 07:11.968
It's a promise!

07:19.630 --> 07:21.592
I was so nervous.

07:21.601 --> 07:23.748
Sorry, Saki.

07:23.783 --> 07:26.485
She's not a bad person.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.098
She tries really hard to be strong.

07:29.133 --> 07:30.661
And she's not very frank.

07:32.771 --> 07:35.310
We've been hanging out since middle school,

07:35.345 --> 07:37.850
so I kind of understand how she thinks.

07:38.788 --> 07:41.675
But she doesn't have any other friends,

07:41.980 --> 07:44.542
so I can't really leave her alone.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.231
Excuse me.

08:02.287 --> 08:05.353
As expected, you're right on time.

08:05.388 --> 08:06.905
Let's get started.

08:07.295 --> 08:08.578
Don't close the door.

08:10.285 --> 08:11.497
Have a seat.

08:12.244 --> 08:13.191
Okay.

08:19.395 --> 08:21.374
The subject and predicate are the same,

08:21.375 --> 08:24.199
so "it" becomes "which".

08:26.779 --> 08:28.154
I don't get it at all.

08:28.189 --> 08:29.388
Are you stupid?

08:29.423 --> 08:30.235
Stupid?

08:30.270 --> 08:32.770
Tell me which part you don't understand.

08:33.375 --> 08:37.726
Why does a single verb have two uses as
both an interrogative and relative pronoun?

08:37.760 --> 08:40.480
Why does a word have a different
meaning depending on its context?

08:40.485 --> 08:41.870
There isn't a reason.

08:41.905 --> 08:43.256
You just memorize it.

08:43.437 --> 08:45.303
Everything has a rule.

08:45.338 --> 08:48.584
If you can't explain the rules,
I won't be able to learn it.

08:50.271 --> 08:51.746
I see.

08:52.579 --> 08:56.372
Didn't you win first prize
in a math tournament?

08:56.563 --> 08:58.808
The way you think is very different.

08:58.843 --> 09:00.306
It's impressive.

09:00.545 --> 09:02.220
In math, everything has a rule.

09:02.255 --> 09:03.929
There is usually only one answer.

09:03.964 --> 09:05.603
Math's simplicity is beautiful.

09:05.638 --> 09:06.608
So I like it.

09:07.434 --> 09:08.775
Are you not happy?

09:08.804 --> 09:10.113
I was just praising you.

09:14.093 --> 09:15.525
Have you..

09:16.180 --> 09:18.020
Ever laughed or cried?

09:18.055 --> 09:20.206
Does that have anything to do with English?

09:20.682 --> 09:22.835
That's why I asked.

09:22.975 --> 09:28.603
Being able to express things like happiness
and sadness is the key to English.

09:29.592 --> 09:32.181
But people don't always
have only one emotion.

09:33.035 --> 09:35.929
People can think something is
fun while also being bored.

09:35.964 --> 09:38.072
They can find something
troublesome and have fun.

09:38.074 --> 09:39.040
We're complicated.

09:40.570 --> 09:44.852
That's why, unlike math, there aren't
hard-and-fast rules in English.

09:47.590 --> 09:49.520
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

09:50.961 --> 09:52.695
Are you actually a prodigy?

09:52.938 --> 09:54.498
These lessons are pointless.

09:54.934 --> 09:57.470
Please don't concern
yourself with me anymore

09:58.035 --> 10:00.544
I've given up on English already.

10:05.931 --> 10:08.096
You're acting like this
on purpose, aren't you?

10:08.710 --> 10:11.216
You're not running from
this, so prepare yourself.

10:11.421 --> 10:12.818
Your cologne is too strong.

10:13.512 --> 10:14.368
What?

10:14.964 --> 10:17.182
Please back off or the smell will stick.

10:18.123 --> 10:19.724
Why are you acting so tough?

10:50.310 --> 10:51.403
I'm home.

10:51.843 --> 10:52.900
Welcome back.

10:53.547 --> 10:55.374
How was the lesson with Sakurai-sensei?

10:55.409 --> 10:57.456
Nothing out of the ordinary.

10:58.952 --> 10:59.863
I see.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.671
Well, you wouldn't have any problems.

11:03.992 --> 11:04.825
Yeah.

11:05.731 --> 11:08.606
Well, since you have the chance,

11:08.731 --> 11:10.316
why don't you give it your best shot?

11:10.820 --> 11:15.488
You wanted to study under Mendel at that
university in California, didn't you?

11:19.871 --> 11:21.433
I can't do that.

11:21.883 --> 11:25.033
I already gave up on it a long time ago.

11:26.442 --> 11:27.582
I'm going to go change.

11:37.427 --> 11:40.044
Good morning.

11:42.308 --> 11:43.351
Good morning.

11:43.633 --> 11:44.876
Sakurai-sensei.

11:45.920 --> 11:46.963
Good morning.

11:48.489 --> 11:50.763
How are the lessons going?

11:50.968 --> 11:52.474
We only just started.

11:55.713 --> 11:58.691
She's hard to deal with sometimes.

11:58.912 --> 12:00.335
Hard?

12:00.872 --> 12:02.082
No, she's interesting.

12:02.117 --> 12:03.270
Girls like her.

12:04.260 --> 12:07.282
I mean, she doesn't really express herself.

12:07.317 --> 12:10.304
Her facial expression doesn't change much.

12:11.635 --> 12:14.888
She used to smile a lot, but
somewhere along the way..

12:14.923 --> 12:16.133
Sensei, good morning.

12:16.168 --> 12:17.465
Good morning.

12:18.389 --> 12:21.102
But she's a kind, good girl at heart.

12:27.155 --> 12:29.521
This is material I put
together just for you.

12:29.947 --> 12:33.191
The example sentences are
separated by situation.

12:33.458 --> 12:35.819
So you can memorize it
all without thinking.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.335
I can't.

12:37.544 --> 12:41.062
Without knowing the rules,
nothing will stick.

12:42.978 --> 12:44.633
I thought it'd come to this.

12:46.049 --> 12:50.273
Starting now, rewrite all
of these sentences 5 times.

13:06.116 --> 13:07.988
Say them out loud while you write.

13:13.547 --> 13:15.067
You're surprisingly obedient.

13:16.870 --> 13:18.037
He was a tzar,

13:18.072 --> 13:19.169
she was a persont.

13:19.204 --> 13:21.214
It's "peasant", not "persont".

13:25.075 --> 13:27.162
That he, for years, had been.

13:27.669 --> 13:29.208
Which one is the principal clause?

13:29.775 --> 13:30.711
This one.

13:31.029 --> 13:31.811
Yes.

13:31.813 --> 13:34.258
Everything after "that" is
the subordinate clause.

13:34.356 --> 13:38.922
That's why "a peasant" was
omitted after "had been".

13:39.366 --> 13:40.144
Okay.

13:47.732 --> 13:48.942
Then, the antecedent..

13:53.200 --> 13:54.586
Isn't that Sakurai-sensei?

13:55.632 --> 13:58.905
The girl with him.. isn't that Kururugi?

13:59.263 --> 14:00.470
It is.

14:02.695 --> 14:04.719
She's having extra lessons by herself?

14:05.903 --> 14:07.071
What is that..

14:07.803 --> 14:09.188
You all want extra lessons?

14:09.223 --> 14:09.959
Yes.

14:10.129 --> 14:13.112
It's not fair for Kururugi-san
to be the only one.

14:13.147 --> 14:15.461
Please teach us after school as well.

14:15.496 --> 14:16.926
You don't need it.

14:17.129 --> 14:20.784
You all got top marks in
English on the midterms.

14:23.202 --> 14:24.181
That's..

14:25.242 --> 14:26.861
Because we like you.

14:30.783 --> 14:35.374
We studied our hardest...
because we like you.

14:35.409 --> 14:36.555
- Mei-chan.
- Mei-chan.

14:36.870 --> 14:37.865
Yoshida.

14:42.073 --> 14:44.394
Keep working that hard.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.037
Okay?

14:49.397 --> 14:50.480
Okay.

14:52.012 --> 14:54.882
Excuse us.

14:54.885 --> 14:56.950
He smiled for us!

14:56.985 --> 14:59.015
His smile is so cool.

15:05.449 --> 15:11.820
Yoshida Mei seems to be getting
close to you on a personal level.

15:13.039 --> 15:14.234
Vice principal.

15:14.399 --> 15:16.381
It is a phase she's in.

15:16.618 --> 15:18.671
She will be very beautiful
after graduation.

15:18.675 --> 15:21.524
She'll go to university, get a
boyfriend, and have a good time.

15:23.894 --> 15:29.141
Students preparing for exams tend to be
somewhat emotionally unstable, you see?

15:29.340 --> 15:34.791
Of course, I don't at all
think that you are wrong.

15:35.158 --> 15:36.922
But to squelch any rumors..

15:36.957 --> 15:38.408
I understand.

15:41.352 --> 15:42.423
Excuse me.

15:47.334 --> 15:50.956
Reading is to the mind.

15:51.353 --> 15:54.969
But food is to the body.

15:58.377 --> 16:00.189
You've gotten into it.

16:00.910 --> 16:03.285
I'm only doing the task you've given me.

16:03.320 --> 16:07.295
If I don't take it seriously,
these lessons will be pointless.

16:11.017 --> 16:12.870
Then why are you feeling embarrassed?

16:13.885 --> 16:15.331
I'm not embarrassed.

16:15.952 --> 16:17.723
When embarrassed, you feel warmer,

16:18.030 --> 16:20.457
and subconsciously want to
touch something colder.

16:25.563 --> 16:28.300
Should I make you warmer, cheeky-chan?

16:37.331 --> 16:38.747
You're easy to understand.

16:39.987 --> 16:41.172
People, you see,

16:41.946 --> 16:44.900
their subconscious actions can't lie.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.648
That's why I can understand you.

16:50.491 --> 16:52.818
Even if you keep a stern face.

16:54.726 --> 16:55.655
I'm not..

16:56.609 --> 16:58.371
Keeping a..

17:11.183 --> 17:12.431
Are you

17:14.369 --> 17:16.977
doing that to suppress your emotions?

17:29.851 --> 17:31.446
Don't misunderstand.

17:31.952 --> 17:34.949
I'm only doing this as your teacher.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.245
There's no special kind of interest in it.

17:40.002 --> 17:41.671
I'm not misunderstanding anything.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.417
Because I hate you.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.182
That's good to hear.

17:55.169 --> 17:57.532
Adolescent

17:58.356 --> 18:00.931
prehistoric.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.414
Yuni, can't you take a break at lunch?

18:04.430 --> 18:07.282
I have to get at least 70 on today's test.

18:07.332 --> 18:08.726
Or these lessons won't stop.

18:09.144 --> 18:11.498
I can't get marks on the essay sections,

18:11.612 --> 18:13.864
so I have to do well on the rest.

18:14.186 --> 18:16.498
Do you hate him that much?

18:16.533 --> 18:19.454
Everyone says his teaching
style is easy to understand.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.599
A lot of girls in my class like him.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.052
I hate him.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.124
Irresponsible and not
serious, yet self conscious.

18:26.159 --> 18:28.068
Someone like that isn't qualified to teach.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.168
Then there's that smell..

18:31.203 --> 18:34.239
Oh, his cologne?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.777
It's a nice smell~~

18:36.861 --> 18:37.727
I hate it.

18:37.762 --> 18:38.858
Why?

18:42.500 --> 18:47.142
The effects of a person's smell on the opinions that other
people have of them was tested at the University of California-

18:47.155 --> 18:48.190
I got it, I got it.

18:48.246 --> 18:50.525
Anyway, good luck on your test.

18:51.477 --> 18:52.809
Thanks, Nami-chan.

18:54.682 --> 18:56.571
Eminent

19:10.369 --> 19:12.821
I know more answers than before..

19:54.140 --> 19:55.230
Hey!

19:57.005 --> 19:58.442
Could we talk?

20:09.843 --> 20:11.768
You've been

20:13.098 --> 20:16.959
getting things wrong on
purpose, haven't you?

20:17.232 --> 20:19.891
I thought it was strange from the start.

20:20.037 --> 20:21.810
You're the best at everything else,

20:21.845 --> 20:23.879
but somehow you don't know English?

20:23.914 --> 20:25.914
She's obviously after Sakurai-sensei!

20:26.033 --> 20:27.214
That is wrong.

20:27.218 --> 20:28.690
What is?

20:28.725 --> 20:30.815
I hate Sakurai-sensei.

20:30.850 --> 20:34.147
It's ridiculous that I'd fall
for someone so irresponsible.

20:35.463 --> 20:36.747
I don't get it.

20:37.709 --> 20:39.225
You always have the same face.

20:39.260 --> 20:42.274
Yeah, it's impossible to
see what you're thinking.

20:42.275 --> 20:46.488
If you hate him, show it in your face!

20:52.290 --> 20:53.158
I'm going to go.

20:53.193 --> 20:54.026
I'll be late for my-

20:54.032 --> 20:55.170
Hold up!

20:55.245 --> 20:57.576
You actually want to see him!

20:57.611 --> 20:59.188
You piss me off!

20:59.501 --> 21:02.685
He has no reason to make you take lessons!

21:04.635 --> 21:06.190
Mei-chan, let's go!

21:06.225 --> 21:07.745
Mei-chan, hurry!

21:31.510 --> 21:33.805
Have any of you seen Kururugi?

21:33.840 --> 21:36.100
I think she went home already.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.500
She might be too embarrassed to see you

21:39.503 --> 21:41.739
because she did badly on the test.

21:41.742 --> 21:44.522
Yeah, he spent so much time teaching her.

22:33.430 --> 22:35.419
Why are you..

22:35.615 --> 22:39.642
I told you, I know all about you.

22:40.477 --> 22:41.750
I say that, but..

22:42.574 --> 22:44.897
I actually made them confess.

22:45.928 --> 22:48.825
I scolded them and said
to not do this again.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.334
It was hard for you, right?

22:52.960 --> 22:54.014
Are you okay?

22:56.597 --> 22:57.822
I am fine.

22:57.846 --> 22:59.557
Even if you hadn't come,

22:59.606 --> 23:01.402
I would have got out this window.

23:02.777 --> 23:04.237
From that?

23:14.883 --> 23:16.095
Kururugi!

23:17.356 --> 23:19.547
You're not fine at all!

23:53.276 --> 23:57.973
Now then, since Taguchi-sensei
has been sick for some time,

23:58.008 --> 24:00.215
a new teacher will be come
in a couple of weeks.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.380
Isn't that Kururugi-san?
Really?!

24:12.697 --> 24:13.931
That's Kururugi, right?

24:14.381 --> 24:15.766
Why?!

24:28.310 --> 24:29.560
It's just a small sprain,

24:29.595 --> 24:30.811
but don't move it much.

24:31.113 --> 24:32.614
It'll get better faster that way.

24:36.989 --> 24:38.036
Kururugi.

24:39.469 --> 24:42.079
Be more upfront about your emotions.

25:00.272 --> 25:01.637
Sensei.

25:08.860 --> 25:10.011
What happened, Yuni?

25:12.130 --> 25:14.328
I just tripped.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.519
You tripped?

25:15.602 --> 25:17.270
Is that true, Sakurai-sensei?

25:17.330 --> 25:18.165
It's true!

25:19.528 --> 25:21.142
It's not a big deal.

25:21.448 --> 25:22.709
I'm fine.

25:27.162 --> 25:28.458
I understand.

25:28.772 --> 25:30.589
Then, I'll call us a taxi.

25:30.624 --> 25:31.577
Let's get you home.

25:32.192 --> 25:34.874
I'll see her home.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.125
Thank you very much.

25:36.127 --> 25:37.911
That's all for me, then.

26:20.137 --> 26:23.298
Good thing it was just a small sprain.

26:24.123 --> 26:26.628
But that was terrible of Yoshida.

26:26.663 --> 26:28.828
I will scold them the next time I see them.

26:28.832 --> 26:32.380
It's alright, Sakurai-sensei already did.

26:33.442 --> 26:34.845
That's good, then.

26:37.532 --> 26:38.881
By the way, Nami-chan.

26:38.916 --> 26:40.231
What are you here to buy?

26:40.892 --> 26:42.434
A present for Saki.

26:43.029 --> 26:44.099
For Satou-kun?

26:44.134 --> 26:45.835
Yeah, he got a job placement.

26:47.116 --> 26:49.639
His taste is a bit girly,

26:49.674 --> 26:53.154
so I thought I'd give him
something more manly.

26:55.390 --> 26:59.642
When someone you love uses
something you bought them,

26:59.677 --> 27:00.904
it makes you happy, right?

27:38.347 --> 27:41.205
"This is the city which I was born in"

27:48.720 --> 27:52.828
I've included this and others
that you seem to struggle with.

27:53.627 --> 27:58.043
Listen to this for at least
10 minutes every day.

28:27.611 --> 28:28.692
Umm..

28:32.472 --> 28:33.597
What is this?

28:34.528 --> 28:36.157
It's in thanks for the other day.

28:38.679 --> 28:41.215
I can't take a present from a student.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.129
It'd be bad for me if people misunderstood.

28:43.916 --> 28:45.865
I am not misunderstanding anything.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.202
It's just a thank you.

28:47.237 --> 28:48.465
There is no deep meaning!

28:48.500 --> 28:50.427
Why are you getting so serious?

28:50.462 --> 28:52.354
Did you actually fall for me?

28:52.389 --> 28:54.005
Have you lost it?

28:54.040 --> 28:55.585
Seriously? So dull..

28:55.620 --> 28:58.251
It was nice when you had no interest in me.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.678
I was being nice to you
because it's my job.

29:06.895 --> 29:07.725
I was just..

29:08.408 --> 29:11.095
Trying.. to thank you..

29:57.663 --> 30:00.049
Yuni, food's ready.

30:10.657 --> 30:12.372
You're reading Mendel's book?

30:12.677 --> 30:13.553
Yeah.

30:16.712 --> 30:19.137
Did something happen during your lessons?

30:20.135 --> 30:21.208
No

30:21.730 --> 30:25.762
I kinda just.. wanted to read it.

30:34.717 --> 30:36.141
Sakurai-sensei!

30:39.147 --> 30:43.305
Akechi-sensei, Kururugi Yuni's
guardian, made a demand today

30:43.340 --> 30:47.448
for the formal ending of her extra lessons.

30:48.932 --> 30:50.022
Her guardian?

30:50.334 --> 30:54.937
The truth is, her parents
are working abroad.

30:55.570 --> 30:58.503
She has been left under
Akechi-sensei's care.

31:00.501 --> 31:03.009
Ever since the lessons started,

31:03.221 --> 31:06.748
she has been acting erratically.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.705
This weekend was especially bad.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.725
She spent it in her room
reading Mendel's books.

31:11.569 --> 31:12.720
Mendel?

31:13.583 --> 31:17.551
He's a professor of genetic engineering
at University of California.

31:18.371 --> 31:23.863
When something is really bothering her, she has a
habit of going to her room and reading his books.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.497
What has she said?

31:27.298 --> 31:28.326
Nothing.

31:29.393 --> 31:32.829
She has never really been one to
tell me what's upsetting her.

31:33.113 --> 31:36.459
If you're her guardian,
shouldn't you check with her?

31:39.595 --> 31:41.904
I have nothing to feel guilty for.

31:43.266 --> 31:44.206
Well,

31:44.263 --> 31:48.222
we don't believe you've
done anything, either.

31:48.694 --> 31:53.143
Kururugi-san's grades in
English have gone up a lot.

31:53.196 --> 31:55.575
She can still do better.

31:55.610 --> 31:58.478
It's enough already, Sakurai-sensei.

32:00.002 --> 32:04.484
With her current scores and
our recommendation letter,

32:04.519 --> 32:06.800
she could get into any school she wishes.

32:07.989 --> 32:11.757
Kururugi Yuni's extra lessons
are, from today, over.

32:11.929 --> 32:12.828
Alright?

32:21.141 --> 32:24.301
Sakurai-sensei's lessons
have been canceled.

32:25.430 --> 32:28.388
They've been.. canceled?

32:28.990 --> 32:31.822
Your scores have gone up a lot,
so they say you don't need them.

32:31.941 --> 32:32.848
You've done well.

32:33.941 --> 32:34.849
Yeah.

32:35.223 --> 32:35.993
Bye, then.

33:10.606 --> 33:12.108
Sakurai-sensei!

33:13.192 --> 33:18.190
Sakurai-sensei! Today, after the English club's
activities, will you come to karaoke with us?

33:18.195 --> 33:20.290
I have no reason to go with students.

33:23.792 --> 33:26.157
Get to your studies.

33:27.885 --> 33:29.504
I'm busy, you know!

33:29.720 --> 33:31.325
Sensei, please!

33:31.360 --> 33:33.248
I want to go with you!

33:33.424 --> 33:34.308
Please!

33:35.686 --> 33:39.480
"Were" is past tense,
so to match the tenses,

33:39.515 --> 33:41.909
"will" becomes "would".

33:41.970 --> 33:44.700
This is called the "subjunctive past".

33:46.845 --> 33:47.986
Yes~.

33:57.737 --> 33:58.351
Okuda.

33:58.475 --> 33:59.135
Yes?

33:59.170 --> 34:00.986
Translate this top part.

34:00.992 --> 34:01.780
Okay.

34:04.341 --> 34:07.830
"He said he was ill, which was a lie."

34:18.389 --> 34:20.956
"This is the city which I was born in."

34:21.849 --> 34:23.608
What are you doing? Go on home.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.277
What's wrong, Yuni?

34:46.313 --> 34:47.849
You haven't eaten at all.

34:51.147 --> 34:54.061
It's nothing.. I'm fine.

35:03.137 --> 35:07.382
Actually, even I don't understand.

35:08.913 --> 35:10.643
I'm not sure what, but..

35:10.892 --> 35:17.091
Something.. in here is.. trembling.

35:17.661 --> 35:18.934
Trembling?

35:19.460 --> 35:23.996
I hate him, but it makes
me sad when he's cold.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.182
I don't want to see him,

35:27.879 --> 35:30.802
but not being able to see him is lonely.

35:32.597 --> 35:34.906
Yuni, that's love.

35:35.760 --> 35:36.948
Love?

35:37.165 --> 35:38.071
Yeah.

35:38.777 --> 35:40.677
Loving and hating.

35:40.784 --> 35:43.871
Having both is true love.

35:46.784 --> 35:49.128
Saki and I got into a fight.

35:49.326 --> 35:51.998
When I gave him the present I got him,

35:52.033 --> 35:54.671
he said "I don't like it" so casually!

35:54.706 --> 35:56.689
He really pisses me off!

35:59.663 --> 36:00.777
But..

36:01.677 --> 36:03.670
I still love him.

36:04.529 --> 36:05.822
Nami-chan..

36:07.009 --> 36:11.781
At first, I felt I liked
everything about him.

36:12.058 --> 36:15.274
But now that I can say I
hate him and love him,

36:15.541 --> 36:17.513
it feels like it's real.

36:19.815 --> 36:22.692
"Real.. love."

36:25.897 --> 36:29.062
What am I saying?!

36:30.640 --> 36:33.022
You finally opened up a little bit,

36:33.023 --> 36:34.828
so I shared a bit too much.

36:35.866 --> 36:37.104
Sorry.

36:38.546 --> 36:40.331
That's not what I mean.

36:42.077 --> 36:43.300
I'm happy.

36:46.780 --> 36:50.374
You're always thinking about other people.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.600
You don't really say what
you're feeling yourself.

36:54.692 --> 36:58.945
I thought that might be a little lonely.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.436
Nami-chan..

37:10.930 --> 37:13.877
So, who is he?

37:16.581 --> 37:17.836
I can't tell you.

37:18.029 --> 37:19.534
What is that?

37:19.574 --> 37:23.252
Well, if it goes well
let me know right away!

37:23.470 --> 37:24.276
Okay.

37:24.774 --> 37:26.160
It's a promise.

37:51.160 --> 37:51.660
"Love."

38:04.865 --> 38:07.745
"The path to the best conclusion
is to confess your feelings!"

38:07.780 --> 38:10.580
Confess? "The path to the best
conclusion is to confess your feelings!"

38:10.876 --> 38:12.621
I see..

38:19.706 --> 38:21.162
Stand!

38:23.501 --> 38:24.569
Bow!

38:26.243 --> 38:27.453
Be seated.

38:28.775 --> 38:29.769
Sensei!

38:31.289 --> 38:32.290
What, Kururugi?

38:34.989 --> 38:36.695
I li..

38:49.577 --> 38:51.482
Please start the class right away.

38:51.487 --> 38:53.896
We're 3 minutes and 23 seconds late.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.665
We're starting, cheeky-chan.

39:06.024 --> 39:07.714
I can't say it..

39:09.162 --> 39:10.654
In front of everyone..

39:21.537 --> 39:22.685
What?

39:24.437 --> 39:27.588
Smoking is scientifically
proven to be bad for you.

39:27.937 --> 39:29.015
Is that so?

39:29.320 --> 39:31.174
You're poisoning your body! Stop!

39:32.197 --> 39:33.276
What?

39:33.630 --> 39:35.820
What do you want, cheeky-chan?

39:40.630 --> 39:44.480
Sensei, I li..

39:46.297 --> 39:47.211
Li...?

39:48.439 --> 39:49.526
I li..

39:50.981 --> 39:52.144
Spit it out!

39:52.145 --> 39:54.348
Please teach me how to spell Spacium Beam!

39:54.349 --> 39:55.842
Stop screwing around.

40:00.646 --> 40:04.008
Is this from that experiment from before?

40:04.483 --> 40:06.525
Ah, yeah, that was done last week.

40:07.205 --> 40:11.086
Why can't I bring myself to say it?

40:15.513 --> 40:16.941
Yabe-sensei!

40:16.976 --> 40:18.227
Yes~~?

40:19.783 --> 40:21.034
Yabe-sensei,

40:22.043 --> 40:24.025
We did an experiment last week, right?

40:25.067 --> 40:27.416
I wrote down some things that I didn't get.

40:27.451 --> 40:30.238
Oh, thanks for coming to me about it.

40:30.273 --> 40:31.530
Can you have a look?

40:31.565 --> 40:32.548
Lets see..

40:33.215 --> 40:35.037
Ahhhh! Basically-

40:37.232 --> 40:38.560
A notebook..

40:41.150 --> 40:44.291
I wrote down some things
I don't understand.

40:44.713 --> 40:46.728
Can you have a look?

40:48.480 --> 40:49.860
At the things I don't..

40:49.895 --> 40:51.240
Sensei's coming! Sensei!

41:01.889 --> 41:03.034
Stand!

41:06.030 --> 41:06.991
Bow!

41:08.765 --> 41:09.953
Be seated.

41:16.694 --> 41:18.254
Is Kururugi away today?

41:18.695 --> 41:20.288
She was here a moment ago.

41:20.297 --> 41:21.394
Yeah, she was.

41:23.229 --> 41:24.712
Maybe she went to the washroom.

41:43.160 --> 41:50.536
"I hate you, sensei but I also
like you! What should I do?"

41:59.765 --> 42:01.728
What's the problem, sensei?

42:02.446 --> 42:03.867
Nothing.

42:04.489 --> 42:06.945
Suzuki, read page 16.

42:07.239 --> 42:08.057
Okay.

42:18.150 --> 42:19.547
You..

42:48.186 --> 42:52.425
This is the class you will be in charge of.

42:52.460 --> 42:53.260
Got it.

43:44.457 --> 43:45.528
About just now..

43:49.753 --> 43:50.865
I'm sorry.

43:56.050 --> 43:59.029
Why are you apologizing?

44:01.470 --> 44:02.846
I was wrong to do that.

44:08.640 --> 44:09.753
Please forget it.

44:29.113 --> 44:30.820
Oh, Sakurai-sensei.

44:31.292 --> 44:32.388
I'll introduce you.

44:37.356 --> 44:41.441
This is the teacher who will
take over for Taguchi-sensei,

44:41.445 --> 44:42.803
Takizawa-sensei.

44:42.972 --> 44:45.748
Long time no see, Sakurai-sensei.

44:48.698 --> 44:51.525
We've been friends since elementary school.

44:52.639 --> 44:54.821
Oh, you were?

44:56.052 --> 44:57.040
Right?

45:02.904 --> 45:04.774
This is so nostalgic!

45:05.771 --> 45:08.377
It hasn't changed much since we here last.

45:10.126 --> 45:11.523
Hey, do you remember?

45:11.558 --> 45:15.526
The tree that your dad said grants wishes.

45:25.903 --> 45:30.187
If you walk around this tree 3
times with your eyes closed,

45:30.649 --> 45:33.500
while repeating your wish over and over,

45:34.286 --> 45:36.083
it will come true.

45:48.294 --> 45:49.645
That story was a lie.

45:51.141 --> 45:53.356
Another one of his made-up stories.

45:54.833 --> 45:56.190
Is that so?

45:56.418 --> 45:59.073
I figured wishes don't come true.

46:01.326 --> 46:02.257
Mirei.

46:03.353 --> 46:06.386
You didn't seek me out to
talk about that, did you?

46:10.930 --> 46:14.323
You're as sharp as ever, Haruka.

46:22.149 --> 46:24.020
That habit hasn't changed.

46:24.700 --> 46:26.720
You always do it after a kiss.

46:28.497 --> 46:29.684
I saw it yesterday.

46:31.347 --> 46:33.054
I saw you in the classroom.

46:34.352 --> 46:35.645
Kissing a student.

46:42.866 --> 46:47.551
Accidentally? A kiss? With a student?

46:48.460 --> 46:50.748
Yes, exactly.

46:54.452 --> 46:56.940
We already talked it over, though.

47:04.543 --> 47:05.697
Hey..

47:09.818 --> 47:12.682
When we were dating in highschool,

47:12.906 --> 47:14.713
we shared a lot of kisses.

47:15.946 --> 47:17.781
But I always made the move.

47:18.097 --> 47:19.338
Do you remember?

47:22.421 --> 47:23.827
I don't.

47:26.901 --> 47:28.150
You wouldn't.

47:30.916 --> 47:33.553
You didn't really love me, after all.

47:36.546 --> 47:38.334
But I remember.

47:40.021 --> 47:42.295
Because I truly loved you.

47:50.947 --> 47:52.518
What are you trying to say?

47:56.775 --> 47:59.189
That you really do..

47:59.437 --> 48:01.089
Love that student.

48:03.827 --> 48:05.028
If you didn't..

48:05.682 --> 48:08.282
You'd never make the move.

48:09.812 --> 48:11.606
It's like you always say,

48:11.763 --> 48:14.289
"People's subconscious actions can't lie".

48:17.273 --> 48:20.402
You really can't do this, Haruka.

48:20.983 --> 48:23.021
Love between a teacher and a student..

48:23.439 --> 48:24.525
If you were found out,

48:24.710 --> 48:26.731
You won't be able to teach anymore.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.948
If it goes badly, you could be sued!

48:28.983 --> 48:30.857
I know that without you telling me.

48:50.920 --> 48:55.066
Please hand in your list of
university choices by next Monday.

48:55.101 --> 48:56.954
Okaaa~~~~y.

48:56.997 --> 48:59.746
Isn't Takizawa-sensei really cute?

48:59.781 --> 49:02.402
I thought so too! Sooo cute!

49:02.490 --> 49:04.317
I think I've fallen in love.

49:04.328 --> 49:05.594
My god..

49:20.169 --> 49:21.511
Kururugi-san!

49:28.922 --> 49:31.302
I heard from Sakurai-sensei.

49:32.383 --> 49:34.557
About you and him.

49:35.744 --> 49:37.600
Are you alright?

49:44.183 --> 49:46.120
You can come to me for advice.

49:46.291 --> 49:48.442
Because I'm your homeroom teacher,

49:48.935 --> 49:50.008
and we're both women.

49:51.393 --> 49:52.243
Okay.

50:05.430 --> 50:07.994
They're surprisingly obedient.

50:08.036 --> 50:10.220
Their English grades are all going up, too.

50:17.788 --> 50:19.123
They are.

50:19.472 --> 50:23.531
I never thought you'd be a teacher, though!

50:25.627 --> 50:27.455
Hey, hey! Look at that!

50:27.664 --> 50:29.862
I heard those two were childhood friends!

50:31.343 --> 50:32.580
They look great together!

50:32.585 --> 50:34.744
It looks like adult's love~~~.

50:36.555 --> 50:37.715
Closeclosecloseclose!

50:37.750 --> 50:39.625
No way, they're so close together!

51:10.360 --> 51:11.285
Take care.

51:11.288 --> 51:12.452
Bye~~.

51:23.815 --> 51:26.311
Kururugi.. what are you doing?

51:27.229 --> 51:28.702
Sakurai-sensei.

51:29.344 --> 51:34.070
You told me to be more
upfront with my emotions.

51:35.667 --> 51:38.671
I love you, sensei.

51:39.830 --> 51:41.513
So I really can't forget

51:42.494 --> 51:44.024
about what happened.

51:53.737 --> 51:54.774
We can't do this.

51:55.661 --> 51:56.551
Forget it.

52:01.731 --> 52:04.540
Kururugi! Look at me!

52:07.873 --> 52:09.522
Don't get the wrong idea.

52:10.334 --> 52:13.819
The feelings you have right now..
Are temporary.

52:14.100 --> 52:15.430
With some time,

52:17.380 --> 52:19.282
you will naturally forget it.

52:32.775 --> 52:34.348
Sensei..

52:35.386 --> 52:37.151
You don't understand me at all!

53:08.319 --> 53:11.105
Use what I taught you to get perfect marks.

53:11.140 --> 53:12.460
Okaaaaa~~~~y.

53:44.741 --> 53:45.925
Hey, let's get out of here.

53:48.089 --> 53:50.865
WHOA! WHOA whoa whoa whoa!

53:50.900 --> 53:53.490
What's with this notebook?!
It has a freakin' lock!

53:53.956 --> 53:57.088
Matoba's basically a delinquent
but he has such a cute notebook!

53:57.123 --> 54:00.196
He's already left, right? Let's open it up!

54:02.870 --> 54:04.390
What is it, Kururugi?

54:04.425 --> 54:06.595
Don't just look through
other people's things.

54:06.630 --> 54:11.025
Don't be so stiff! If we put it back
where we got it, he won't know.

54:11.060 --> 54:12.837
What won't I know?!

54:13.753 --> 54:17.106
Ohshitohshitohshit get out of here!

54:29.277 --> 54:30.138
Here.

54:34.263 --> 54:37.486
Thank you very much!

54:40.344 --> 54:42.614
This notebook is very important to me.

54:43.427 --> 54:46.544
I'm extremely, thoroughly thankful.

54:48.445 --> 54:49.821
I haven't really..

54:54.146 --> 54:55.258
Kururugi-san?

54:56.781 --> 54:57.857
Kururugi-san!

55:05.617 --> 55:06.910
Kururugi!

55:10.120 --> 55:11.119
What's with her?

55:11.154 --> 55:12.119
What happened?

55:21.735 --> 55:23.457
She has a really high fever.

55:25.752 --> 55:28.462
We'll need help to get her home.

55:29.640 --> 55:31.908
I'll call Akechi-sensei.

55:31.997 --> 55:33.172
Please do.

55:44.559 --> 55:45.802
Don't tell her

55:47.232 --> 55:48.802
that I helped her.

55:49.906 --> 55:50.735
Okay.

55:52.432 --> 55:54.947
Excuse me, is Akechi-sensei there?

55:56.748 --> 55:57.629
Good morning.

55:57.664 --> 55:58.772
Mornin'.

55:59.309 --> 56:01.764
So, their friends get all scattered about,

56:01.799 --> 56:04.219
but they do their best
to find them together.

56:04.254 --> 56:05.733
Is it that interesting?

56:05.737 --> 56:06.379
Morning!

56:06.414 --> 56:07.548
Kururugi-san!

56:08.020 --> 56:09.388
I'll carry your things.

56:10.144 --> 56:11.562
I'm fine, Matoba-kun.

56:11.597 --> 56:12.883
Please don't talk like that.

56:14.873 --> 56:18.088
Matoba-kun seems kind of like a squire.

56:18.149 --> 56:20.448
She protected my notebook.

56:20.483 --> 56:21.717
She's a savior.

56:21.916 --> 56:24.267
Matoba-kun is my savior, as well.

56:24.430 --> 56:26.779
He brought me to the
infirmary when I collapsed.

56:43.063 --> 56:44.430
Sakurai-sensei.

56:47.094 --> 56:49.756
Here's the list of school
duties over the summer.

57:16.501 --> 57:20.418
Sorry for inviting you somewhere
like this so suddenly.

57:20.715 --> 57:23.772
It's alright, I like sweets.

57:24.356 --> 57:26.105
Thank goodness!

57:26.957 --> 57:30.138
Truth is, I'm aiming to be a pastry chef.

57:30.512 --> 57:34.768
I want to carefully study the
things I eat at places like this.

57:35.440 --> 57:38.342
But it's hard to come in here alone.

57:38.397 --> 57:40.008
I didn't know that!

57:42.360 --> 57:45.508
This book you protected for me before

57:45.543 --> 57:49.294
it's got recipes my dad wrote -
he's a pastry chef in France.

57:50.282 --> 57:54.125
After graduation, I want to
save money, go to France,

57:54.160 --> 57:56.537
and train at my dad's shop.

57:59.866 --> 58:04.157
Sorry, this is probably boring for you.

58:04.183 --> 58:05.775
It wasn't boring at all.

58:06.183 --> 58:07.590
I was moved.

58:08.467 --> 58:12.553
Unlike you, I don't have a
clear dream for the future.

58:13.063 --> 58:18.306
When I was in middle school, I had a dream to
study under Mendel at University of California.

58:19.239 --> 58:21.857
But I wasn't able to speak English..

58:22.464 --> 58:24.951
In the end, I gave up on that.

58:25.200 --> 58:27.588
You can definitely study abroad!

58:27.589 --> 58:29.578
You are super smart.

58:30.159 --> 58:32.903
You still have time!

58:43.629 --> 58:46.127
Over 110 points on TOEFL..

58:47.144 --> 58:49.151
I can't do that..

59:34.051 --> 59:35.775
Sakurai-sensei..

59:46.272 --> 59:48.837
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.

59:49.129 --> 59:51.484
Have you heard the expression,

59:51.700 --> 59:54.788
"With nodes, bamboo grows strong."

59:55.230 --> 59:58.912
Bamboo grows perfectly straight,

59:58.914 --> 01:00:01.307
without bending or breaking,

01:00:01.342 --> 01:00:03.701
exactly because it has nodes.

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:08.051
You are standing before a turning
point we call summer vacation

01:00:08.537 --> 01:00:10.991
and you may begin to question your path-

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.715
We can swim in the ocean,

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.350
cut up some watermelons,

01:00:15.539 --> 01:00:16.607
eat Yakisoba,

01:00:16.642 --> 01:00:17.782
and watch fireworks.

01:00:17.817 --> 01:00:20.477
I think I'll study a bit..

01:00:21.724 --> 01:00:26.245
The mock test was pretty difficult.

01:00:26.366 --> 01:00:28.742
I couldn't do it at all.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:37.852
Matoba-kun, why don't you
hold hands with Yuni?

01:00:38.128 --> 01:00:39.599
You like her, right?

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:43.440
What's with you? Not
acting like a man at all!

01:00:43.475 --> 01:00:44.954
A man should be more stern!

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.132
What?

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:53.366
Kururugi-san!

01:00:59.426 --> 01:01:00.631
I like you.

01:01:04.045 --> 01:01:04.917
Lucky you!

01:01:04.952 --> 01:01:07.452
Yeah, I really wanted it.

01:01:09.264 --> 01:01:11.918
So, then, how about we go see a movie?

01:01:11.953 --> 01:01:14.573
We only planned for shopping, didn't we?

01:01:14.608 --> 01:01:16.091
You always ask for more and more.

01:01:23.306 --> 01:01:25.493
I'm going to head home.

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:27.370
Wait.

01:01:30.672 --> 01:01:32.297
Should we..

01:01:32.763 --> 01:01:34.665
Start dating again?

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:38.211
What's this all of a sudden?

01:01:40.995 --> 01:01:41.911
Mirei,

01:01:43.086 --> 01:01:43.625
I-

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.904
I know!

01:01:46.408 --> 01:01:47.451
Don't say it.

01:01:49.546 --> 01:01:52.396
"I can't lie about my feelings", right?

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.940
I don't want to hear it again.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.854
You're a bit strange today.

01:02:14.286 --> 01:02:15.371
Kururugi?

01:02:19.999 --> 01:02:21.102
Haruka!

01:02:21.818 --> 01:02:23.012
You can't!

01:02:23.624 --> 01:02:25.320
You know what will happen, right?

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.500
If anyone finds out, you'd be fired!

01:02:37.898 --> 01:02:38.907
Um..

01:02:47.531 --> 01:02:49.803
I'm sorry, Matoba-kun.

01:02:51.055 --> 01:02:53.922
There's.. already someone I love.

01:02:55.288 --> 01:02:56.319
That's why..

01:03:29.475 --> 01:03:31.251
What were you doing?

01:03:31.449 --> 01:03:35.077
You, too.. what's up with you?

01:03:39.891 --> 01:03:41.621
I've been beaten..

01:03:43.306 --> 01:03:44.945
By this kid.

01:04:01.418 --> 01:04:02.537
Kururugi.

01:04:04.448 --> 01:04:06.005
I love you.

01:04:08.063 --> 01:04:09.442
I don't believe you.

01:04:11.771 --> 01:04:13.672
Saying something like that so suddenly.

01:04:13.676 --> 01:04:15.366
It's impossible to believe it!

01:04:16.063 --> 01:04:16.957
Kururugi.

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:20.685
I.. truly love you, sensei!

01:04:21.163 --> 01:04:24.297
But your feelings are probably temporary.

01:04:25.465 --> 01:04:28.980
As long as you can't prove they're real,

01:04:28.986 --> 01:04:30.890
I simply can't believe you!

01:05:05.192 --> 01:05:06.131
What's wrong, Yuni?

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:07.319
Is it the heat?

01:05:08.629 --> 01:05:11.504
No, I'm fine.

01:05:13.507 --> 01:05:15.494
Thank you, Kazuma-kun.

01:05:29.854 --> 01:05:30.793
Yuni?

01:05:35.448 --> 01:05:36.622
I want some donuts.

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:39.184
Donuts? Now?

01:05:40.605 --> 01:05:41.470
Yeah.

01:05:43.809 --> 01:05:45.627
I'll be back.

01:05:47.091 --> 01:05:48.251
Yuni!

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:52.343
Sensei.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:00.333
Where are we-

01:06:00.334 --> 01:06:02.352
Don't worry. Just sit and be quiet.

01:06:19.132 --> 01:06:21.495
This is a hidden place
even locals don't visit.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.181
It's pretty~.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:36.620
What is it?

01:06:37.707 --> 01:06:38.556
Nothing.

01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:42.037
This place is nice, isn't it?

01:06:47.694 --> 01:06:48.987
Kururugi, listen.

01:06:51.052 --> 01:06:53.052
Have you seen a blue sunset?

01:06:53.491 --> 01:06:54.777
A blue sunset?

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:57.677
How could there be one, right?

01:06:58.595 --> 01:07:00.030
Even you don't know.

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:04.369
You'd never see one
unless you went to Mars.

01:07:06.334 --> 01:07:09.446
But my dad would say he saw one.

01:07:09.481 --> 01:07:11.857
He could boast about these things to kids.

01:07:16.103 --> 01:07:18.446
He was a salesman for a trading company.

01:07:20.193 --> 01:07:22.399
He would always go overseas
on business trips.

01:07:22.434 --> 01:07:24.606
Everyone in the company
knew he was a workaholic.

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.882
But sometimes when he was at home,

01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:30.400
He would make up stories like that.

01:07:31.224 --> 01:07:32.717
With a smile on his face.

01:07:44.426 --> 01:07:45.374
And then,

01:07:46.676 --> 01:07:49.468
when I was 12 years old, he killed himself.

01:07:51.489 --> 01:07:54.599
He was lying to us all
the way to the very end.

01:07:55.713 --> 01:07:58.822
He was actually worrying about the
losses his company was suffering.

01:08:04.014 --> 01:08:05.012
And that's why

01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:10.008
I really hate lies.

01:08:21.872 --> 01:08:24.018
I've never talked about this before.

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:26.625
You're the first.

01:08:31.136 --> 01:08:32.770
You can't really follow it, can you?

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.180
A story like this.

01:08:47.203 --> 01:08:48.314
Kururugi.

01:08:49.769 --> 01:08:51.344
After you graduate,

01:08:54.158 --> 01:08:55.066
Let's get married.

01:08:57.154 --> 01:09:00.116
This is the first time I've
fallen for someone on my own.

01:09:01.819 --> 01:09:02.950
So..

01:09:03.566 --> 01:09:06.095
I thought, I could go
anywhere if it's with you.

01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:08.711
That's the reason?

01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:12.151
Isn't suddenly talking about
marriage quite a bit of a leap?

01:09:12.156 --> 01:09:14.522
You're the one who said to prove it.

01:09:15.183 --> 01:09:18.725
That's.. true.. I guess.

01:09:21.386 --> 01:09:23.305
Anyway, what do you say?

01:09:26.768 --> 01:09:29.205
This is more or less a proposal.

01:09:42.331 --> 01:09:43.868
If you're going to go that far..

01:09:44.057 --> 01:09:45.522
I can say yes.

01:09:50.096 --> 01:09:51.541
Sensei.

01:09:54.018 --> 01:09:55.606
I love you, Kururugi.

01:09:57.577 --> 01:09:59.320
If it means being with you,

01:10:01.692 --> 01:10:03.140
I could quit being a teacher.

01:10:20.242 --> 01:10:21.984
But if anyone learns about this,

01:10:22.531 --> 01:10:24.145
You would be expelled.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.914
So until you graduate,

01:10:29.223 --> 01:10:32.428
we have to stay just student and teacher.

01:10:33.307 --> 01:10:34.408
Got it?

01:10:39.085 --> 01:10:40.129
Yes.

01:10:43.843 --> 01:10:45.111
Don't worry.

01:10:47.166 --> 01:10:48.851
I'll protect you

01:10:49.888 --> 01:10:51.500
no matter what happens.

01:10:52.851 --> 01:10:53.735
Okay?

01:10:54.999 --> 01:10:55.928
Yeah.

01:10:58.386 --> 01:10:59.377
Come here.

01:11:01.489 --> 01:11:02.587
Let's go.

01:11:09.106 --> 01:11:10.646
Be careful~.

01:11:13.448 --> 01:11:14.409
Hold up!

01:11:14.445 --> 01:11:15.652
Caught you.

01:11:29.971 --> 01:11:31.140
When the time is right,

01:11:31.753 --> 01:11:33.304
I'll tell Akechi-sensei

01:11:34.786 --> 01:11:36.936
that we will be married.

01:11:37.516 --> 01:11:38.394
Okay.

01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:47.785
You really like that, don't you?

01:11:49.399 --> 01:11:52.322
Kazuma-kun gave it to me
when I was in middle school.

01:11:53.491 --> 01:11:57.042
So that, even expressionless,
I would look a little cuter.

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.002
You don't need something like that.

01:12:04.632 --> 01:12:05.884
From now on,

01:12:07.143 --> 01:12:09.011
I'll be looking right at you.

01:12:39.783 --> 01:12:41.545
Sensei~ Sensei~~

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:44.339
I reeaaally can't understand
this translation, teach me!

01:12:44.374 --> 01:12:45.614
If I must..

01:12:45.615 --> 01:12:47.278
Please do! Pleeeaaaase~.

01:13:03.583 --> 01:13:04.655
Okay.

01:13:22.263 --> 01:13:23.202
Okay.

01:13:28.577 --> 01:13:29.466
Hurry, let's go!

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:55.471
Kururugi-san!

01:14:01.442 --> 01:14:04.174
I'm sorry about that day
after the mock exams.

01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:07.171
For leaving so suddenly.

01:14:08.599 --> 01:14:12.747
I.. thought about chasing after you, but..

01:14:13.285 --> 01:14:14.516
I decided not to.

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:17.680
Because that person was..

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.102
Sakurai-sensei, right?

01:14:24.003 --> 01:14:25.877
I could tell by the cologne.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.030
Oh...

01:14:30.252 --> 01:14:34.785
Sakurai-sensei is the one
that you love, right?

01:14:35.743 --> 01:14:38.221
And he probably..

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.900
It's okay, you don't have to tell me.

01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:48.108
I'm sorry.

01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:50.005
Please don't apologize.

01:14:50.897 --> 01:14:56.597
I'm the one who should apologize, anyway.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.025
Sensei told me to keep it
to myself, so I kept quiet.

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:12.285
But, the one who took you to the
infirmary the day you collapsed.

01:15:12.928 --> 01:15:17.202
It wasn't me.. it was
actually Sakurai-sensei.

01:15:19.206 --> 01:15:20.245
When you fell,

01:15:21.063 --> 01:15:23.630
He suddenly came through the door.

01:15:24.517 --> 01:15:28.845
He.. was really worried about you.

01:15:30.715 --> 01:15:32.483
So that's what happened.

01:15:52.575 --> 01:15:54.771
Oh, you're pretty chipper.

01:15:54.776 --> 01:15:55.906
It'll be done soon.

01:15:59.753 --> 01:16:02.653
You've been putting a lot of
effort into cooking lately.

01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:05.554
But you can make simpler
food like before, you know?

01:16:05.555 --> 01:16:07.399
Since you're preparing for exams.

01:16:08.712 --> 01:16:11.459
It's no problem, this is good for my mood.

01:16:11.494 --> 01:16:14.257
And there's a lot of things
about cooking I want to learn.

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:16.758
Something's strange here~~.

01:16:17.325 --> 01:16:18.793
Nothing's strange.

01:16:48.008 --> 01:16:52.961
"Graduation Ceremony."

01:17:26.658 --> 01:17:29.316
"This is the city which I was born in."

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.005
Seriously? I already.

01:17:48.737 --> 01:17:51.378
"Sakurai-sensei" "Come to the Career
Guidance Office after school."

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:58.087
"Got it."

01:18:05.426 --> 01:18:08.302
Yu~~~~ni! What's up?

01:18:10.639 --> 01:18:12.060
Nothing, really.

01:18:12.677 --> 01:18:13.977
Sorry, Nami-chan.

01:18:14.012 --> 01:18:16.862
Something's come up so I can't
go home with you today.

01:18:17.371 --> 01:18:18.243
Whyyy?

01:18:18.278 --> 01:18:21.760
We had plans to go eat
donuts together for once!

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.260
That's..

01:18:24.731 --> 01:18:29.322
Ah, I'm sorry, I have to get
ready for my next class.

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.108
Yuni?

01:18:51.437 --> 01:18:53.381
I saw the results of the
national mock exam.

01:18:54.261 --> 01:18:56.351
Your English grade has gone up a little.

01:18:58.663 --> 01:19:00.477
Thanks to the study material you gave me.

01:19:01.833 --> 01:19:06.037
You're not satisfied with only
that much improvement, are you?

01:19:10.257 --> 01:19:12.791
You can get even better at English.

01:19:15.892 --> 01:19:19.508
This.. is why you got a hold of me?

01:19:21.003 --> 01:19:22.100
Yes, it is.

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.443
What's wrong?

01:19:30.403 --> 01:19:31.574
Nothing.

01:19:33.432 --> 01:19:34.495
Excuse me.

01:19:35.097 --> 01:19:36.242
Kururugi.

01:19:40.759 --> 01:19:41.858
Are you alright?

01:20:03.987 --> 01:20:05.114
I'm sorry.

01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:10.014
For hurting you.

01:20:14.429 --> 01:20:15.122
Sensei..

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:19.608
I'm..

01:20:21.267 --> 01:20:22.791
Not okay.

01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:41.440
That cat.

01:20:43.565 --> 01:20:45.152
You've decided to put it back on.

01:20:48.058 --> 01:20:49.657
You noticed?

01:20:51.774 --> 01:20:52.905
I told you.

01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:55.829
I'll be looking at you.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.914
Takizawa-sensei.

01:21:30.448 --> 01:21:31.280
Yes?

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.789
Um, can I have a minute?

01:21:33.824 --> 01:21:34.536
Sure.

01:21:38.043 --> 01:21:40.774
Um, you see..

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:44.445
This is about Kururugi Yuni.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.016
Kururugi-san?

01:21:46.051 --> 01:21:46.891
Yes.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.291
She's... seemed a bit strange lately.

01:21:52.058 --> 01:21:55.391
Suddenly saying she wants donuts
and running out of the house.

01:21:56.014 --> 01:21:58.033
She's gotten absorbed in cooking.

01:21:59.563 --> 01:22:03.768
Have you noticed anything
as her homeroom teacher?

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.190
No, nothing in particular.

01:22:08.392 --> 01:22:09.714
Oh..

01:22:10.648 --> 01:22:12.811
How about asking her?

01:22:16.574 --> 01:22:21.865
If she figures out I'm worried,
she won't say anything.

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.585
She's always been that way.

01:22:24.903 --> 01:22:29.283
That's why I've always thought I should
try and stay one step ahead of her,

01:22:29.448 --> 01:22:32.849
but lately I just have no idea what to do.

01:22:35.885 --> 01:22:36.395
Thanks for your time.

01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:37.800
No problem Thanks for your time.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.029
Akechi-sensei.

01:22:54.938 --> 01:22:55.823
Yes?

01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.953
Actually..

01:23:08.134 --> 01:23:09.173
What is this?

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:14.443
I am

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:18.581
going to marry Kururugi.

01:23:20.546 --> 01:23:22.274
Soon after she graduates.

01:23:23.642 --> 01:23:24.646
Marry?

01:23:25.879 --> 01:23:27.276
Are you serious?

01:23:28.803 --> 01:23:31.972
I'm the only one who can protect her.

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.505
What are you saying? She's
still in high school!

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.077
I will never accept this!

01:23:58.931 --> 01:24:00.258
Akechi-sensei!

01:24:03.602 --> 01:24:05.790
Why are you making such a scary face?

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.562
Uh, it's nothing.

01:24:07.615 --> 01:24:10.431
Did you see the results for
the national mock exam?

01:24:10.435 --> 01:24:11.236
No.

01:24:11.799 --> 01:24:17.454
Kururugi-san got over 65 points
in English for the first time.

01:24:17.489 --> 01:24:19.821
65? Really?

01:24:20.218 --> 01:24:22.572
It's amazing for such a short period.

01:24:22.956 --> 01:24:24.006
With these scores,

01:24:24.041 --> 01:24:27.073
she could even aim for
a national university!

01:24:36.344 --> 01:24:37.597
Study abroad?

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.863
At University of California?

01:24:39.898 --> 01:24:41.054
Yes, exactly.

01:24:41.258 --> 01:24:45.027
Your score in English on the
mock exam was much better.

01:24:45.255 --> 01:24:51.756
So I thought that leaving University of
California as just a dream would be a waste.

01:24:52.575 --> 01:24:56.265
But that's just because I
had been preparing for it.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:00.282
It will be fine - your scores in other
subjects are far beyond the cutoff.

01:25:00.317 --> 01:25:03.826
If you keep doing what you're doing,
you will pass the English test.

01:25:04.469 --> 01:25:05.351
Right?

01:25:06.094 --> 01:25:09.037
It's been your dream for a
long time, so give it a shot.

01:25:17.744 --> 01:25:19.446
Something like studying abroad..

01:25:20.691 --> 01:25:22.262
What should I do?

01:25:26.135 --> 01:25:30.153
Yuni~~! I'm going to take a bath first!

01:25:31.217 --> 01:25:32.271
Oka~~y.

01:25:44.743 --> 01:25:48.403
Being able to take one of Mendel's lectures..
Am I dreaming?

01:25:48.855 --> 01:25:55.033
But.. if I do this.. Sakurai-sensei and I..

01:26:14.332 --> 01:26:15.357
Sensei?

01:26:16.443 --> 01:26:19.452
Kururugi? Can you talk right now?

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:21.240
Yes.

01:26:22.157 --> 01:26:24.354
Open your window.

01:26:47.534 --> 01:26:51.727
You even keep that face
when you're at home, huh?

01:26:52.618 --> 01:26:55.106
Did you come all the way
here just to say that?

01:26:56.186 --> 01:26:56.965
Yeah.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.163
Well.

01:27:01.131 --> 01:27:04.135
I suddenly just wanted to see cheeky-chan.

01:27:07.387 --> 01:27:08.713
Sensei..

01:27:09.529 --> 01:27:10.686
Kururugi.

01:27:12.966 --> 01:27:14.365
After you graduate,

01:27:15.623 --> 01:27:17.302
I will for sure

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.357
give you a reason to smile.

01:27:26.873 --> 01:27:27.977
Good night.

01:27:46.166 --> 01:27:49.185
Good night, sensei.

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.710
I have decided not to study abroad.

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:16.394
Why?

01:28:16.495 --> 01:28:17.876
There isn't any reason.

01:28:18.765 --> 01:28:20.773
I'm going to wash my face.

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.075
Have you heard the rumor about
Sakurai-sensei and Kururugi-san?

01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.960
Kururugi-san? Have you heard the rumor
about Sakurai-sensei and Kururugi-san?

01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:44.495
Sakurai-sensei?

01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:45.755
He was with a girl, just the two of them.

01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:46.891
Sakurai-sensei was?
He was with a girl, just the two of them.

01:28:46.914 --> 01:28:48.040
Yeah, just them.

01:28:48.645 --> 01:28:49.671
But he's my councelor!

01:28:49.706 --> 01:28:50.520
And I like him!

01:28:50.555 --> 01:28:51.695
So risky..

01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:53.131
I really liked his classes..

01:28:53.166 --> 01:28:53.937
I did too!

01:28:53.972 --> 01:28:54.673
Riiiiight~~~.

01:28:54.708 --> 01:28:57.272
He makes them fun and easy to understand.

01:28:57.811 --> 01:28:59.001
I think so too.

01:28:59.168 --> 01:28:59.482
He does.

01:28:59.517 --> 01:29:00.610
Such a shock..

01:29:01.663 --> 01:29:03.218
Yuni~~~~

01:29:03.526 --> 01:29:05.682
I heard from Akechi-sensei!

01:29:05.717 --> 01:29:08.928
You're going to attend University
of California? Awesome!

01:29:08.963 --> 01:29:12.140
If you really do, Saki and
I are going to come visit!

01:29:14.618 --> 01:29:17.342
I.. decided not to do it.

01:29:18.116 --> 01:29:18.805
Why?

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.008
You've wanted to do that
since middle school!

01:29:21.043 --> 01:29:22.131
It doesn't matter!

01:29:23.242 --> 01:29:23.881
Yuni?

01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:31.111
You've been.. a bit.. strange lately.

01:29:33.112 --> 01:29:37.310
I don't know why, but you feel.. cold.

01:29:39.695 --> 01:29:41.274
When you said things like that before,

01:29:41.666 --> 01:29:43.553
I never thought you felt cold.

01:29:44.214 --> 01:29:45.178
Why?

01:29:47.817 --> 01:29:51.049
Yuni, are you hiding something from me?

01:29:57.824 --> 01:30:00.375
I thought I understood you
at least a little bit..

01:30:02.723 --> 01:30:04.005
But I..

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:07.340
I don't get you at all.

01:30:08.978 --> 01:30:09.825
Hey!

01:30:23.457 --> 01:30:24.910
Sakurai-sensei.

01:30:25.405 --> 01:30:28.381
Could I have you come to the
principal's office with me?

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:34.405
Sure.

01:31:08.042 --> 01:31:12.160
Listen, there's been a rumor
going around the school lately.

01:31:12.195 --> 01:31:16.278
About why Kururugi-san's English
scores have been going so high.

01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:22.958
"Sakurai-sensei has been continuing
Kururugi-san's English lessons in private."

01:31:24.187 --> 01:31:28.655
Of course, I don't think that is the case.

01:31:30.741 --> 01:31:32.965
But a student is now claiming

01:31:33.427 --> 01:31:37.806
that he saw you two together alone at
a shopping center over summer break.

01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:40.217
This is a problem.

01:31:41.288 --> 01:31:43.879
If a principal hears things like this..

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.395
No, that can't be true.

01:31:48.726 --> 01:31:50.297
I can guarantee it.

01:31:51.165 --> 01:31:52.612
Can you?

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:59.493
Well, if her guardian is
guaranteeing that this isn't true,

01:31:59.637 --> 01:32:01.113
I can rest easy.

01:32:03.427 --> 01:32:05.691
But, Sakurai-sensei.

01:32:06.237 --> 01:32:08.915
You are walking on eggshells,
so take care going forward.

01:32:09.236 --> 01:32:14.190
Exams are getting closer and the
students are especially sensitive.

01:32:16.455 --> 01:32:17.228
Yes, sir.

01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:33.245
Thank you for today.

01:32:33.843 --> 01:32:35.794
I didn't do it for you.

01:32:36.445 --> 01:32:37.768
I did it for Yuni.

01:32:44.552 --> 01:32:47.843
Yuni is giving up the
idea of studying abroad.

01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:50.110
She wanted to study abroad?

01:32:51.137 --> 01:32:54.831
At University of California under Mendel.

01:32:55.101 --> 01:32:57.778
It's been her dream since middle school.

01:32:58.497 --> 01:33:00.368
Her English scores have gone up,

01:33:00.765 --> 01:33:03.664
and I thought she'd finally be
able to realize that dream.

01:33:05.765 --> 01:33:07.740
You understand why now, right?

01:33:12.861 --> 01:33:16.753
Could you try and convince her?

01:33:19.397 --> 01:33:22.154
I don't want to ask you to do this.

01:33:22.435 --> 01:33:24.691
But in thinking about her,
it feels like the only way!

01:33:24.726 --> 01:33:26.005
I can't do that.

01:33:26.555 --> 01:33:28.147
I can't convince her to go.

01:33:28.701 --> 01:33:29.918
Why not?

01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:34.795
She.. won't do it unless we break up.

01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:36.082
Hey!

01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:38.668
She is still a child!

01:33:39.438 --> 01:33:42.402
You.. Are you okay with that as a teacher?

01:33:42.437 --> 01:33:44.203
As an adult?!

01:33:44.204 --> 01:33:45.880
Are you?!

01:34:06.971 --> 01:34:08.254
Welcome~.

01:34:12.454 --> 01:34:13.723
Nami-chan..

01:34:57.792 --> 01:35:00.882
Weren't you supposed to
be with Nanami today?

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:04.350
We got into an argument.

01:35:06.106 --> 01:35:09.868
She was my only friend.

01:35:13.381 --> 01:35:16.126
But it's fine now

01:35:17.355 --> 01:35:20.740
because I have you with me.

01:35:29.867 --> 01:35:30.914
Sensei.

01:35:31.221 --> 01:35:34.504
I've been learning new recipes.

01:35:34.826 --> 01:35:38.100
For you to eat once we're married.

01:35:40.085 --> 01:35:41.654
Shouldn't you be studying for exams?

01:35:42.002 --> 01:35:43.711
My studies aren't a problem.

01:35:44.215 --> 01:35:48.698
They're saying I could get
into whatever school I want.

01:35:59.025 --> 01:36:00.046
You..

01:36:01.866 --> 01:36:03.575
Might still be a child.

01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:06.823
Sensei?

01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:13.380
Kururugi, I can't.

01:36:15.928 --> 01:36:16.834
In the end,

01:36:19.562 --> 01:36:21.126
I can't marry you.

01:36:26.066 --> 01:36:27.220
Why not?

01:36:28.365 --> 01:36:30.126
Where is this coming from?

01:36:32.369 --> 01:36:36.913
Whenever I go home, I
somehow forget about you.

01:36:38.243 --> 01:36:39.648
That made me realize it.

01:36:41.178 --> 01:36:42.353
I've already..

01:36:43.855 --> 01:36:45.694
Gotten over you.

01:36:49.872 --> 01:36:53.815
So.. this is the end.

01:37:16.412 --> 01:37:17.504
Yuni!

01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:21.611
What are you doing here?!

01:37:22.784 --> 01:37:25.323
Nami.. chan?

01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:28.299
I asked Takizawa-sensei and
she said you're away today.

01:37:28.334 --> 01:37:30.622
And Akechi-sensei said you
ran off in the morning.

01:37:30.657 --> 01:37:32.030
I've been so worried!

01:37:36.965 --> 01:37:38.585
Matoba-kun told me.

01:37:39.661 --> 01:37:41.901
About you and Sakurai-sensei.

01:37:44.048 --> 01:37:47.602
That's why you gave up
studying abroad, right?

01:37:50.584 --> 01:37:51.877
You're cruel.

01:37:52.304 --> 01:37:54.658
Why wouldn't you come to me about it?

01:37:55.437 --> 01:37:57.382
You could have said it so many times.

01:37:57.855 --> 01:38:01.171
You promised to tell me if
you'd made a boyfriend!

01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:05.919
You're so distant.. doing this.

01:38:15.753 --> 01:38:16.951
Nami-chan

01:38:19.215 --> 01:38:20.442
I'm sorry.

01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:27.668
But.. we've already broken up.

01:38:31.021 --> 01:38:34.660
He so plainly said he
doesn't love me anymore.

01:38:37.375 --> 01:38:38.768
He was so rude.

01:38:41.837 --> 01:38:43.991
He said that's the end of us.

01:38:46.098 --> 01:38:49.664
I'm.. extremely hurt.

01:38:51.651 --> 01:38:53.027
He's an awful person.

01:38:54.756 --> 01:38:56.117
The worst possible.

01:38:56.596 --> 01:38:57.754
Yeah, he is.

01:38:59.246 --> 01:39:00.523
He's the worst!

01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:02.622
What a guy..

01:39:03.095 --> 01:39:07.677
But.. that's not the most painful part.

01:39:10.066 --> 01:39:13.775
The worst part is I still love him!

01:39:14.417 --> 01:39:15.464
A lot.

01:39:20.144 --> 01:39:24.458
Even though I hate him and
think he's a terrible person.

01:39:26.018 --> 01:39:30.002
That is.. very painful for me right now.

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:33.114
It hurts..

01:39:43.654 --> 01:39:46.221
Why are you crying?

01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.787
Because you won't.

01:39:53.112 --> 01:39:54.588
So I'm doing it for you.

01:40:40.747 --> 01:40:44.040
Hey, there are parent-teacher
meetings next month, right?

01:40:44.075 --> 01:40:44.764
Yeah.

01:40:44.799 --> 01:40:46.556
How is it dealing with the parents?

01:40:47.168 --> 01:40:48.941
Many of them are quite zealous.

01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:53.495
Hold it!

01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:57.417
Matoba-kun? What is it?

01:40:57.843 --> 01:40:59.218
What the hell is this?

01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:03.230
I believed in you and kept my mouth shut.

01:41:05.763 --> 01:41:07.334
Haruka!

01:41:07.546 --> 01:41:09.894
Don't come near Kururugi-san ever again!

01:41:13.082 --> 01:41:13.522
Wait!

01:41:13.557 --> 01:41:14.691
Leave him!

01:41:15.457 --> 01:41:16.675
It's fine.

01:41:33.969 --> 01:41:35.443
I'm sorry, Haruka.

01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:45.624
The one who told Akechi-sensei about
you and Kururugi-san.. was me.

01:41:48.026 --> 01:41:49.436
I knew it.

01:41:52.650 --> 01:41:54.914
If anyone but you had taken that photo,

01:41:54.949 --> 01:41:56.962
the vice principal would
have seen it right away.

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:02.730
You were thinking, "if I tell Akechi-sensei, he will
handle it gently without telling anyone", right?

01:42:07.452 --> 01:42:10.122
You are still as sharp as ever, Haruka.

01:42:12.821 --> 01:42:17.123
But.. I'm not that good of a woman.

01:42:20.232 --> 01:42:25.493
I was thinking.. Akechi-senpai
would force you to break up.

01:42:27.435 --> 01:42:28.582
I'd hoped.

01:42:31.177 --> 01:42:33.210
So you got what you wanted, then.

01:42:36.632 --> 01:42:38.339
I don't think I did.

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:42.929
Because..

01:42:45.735 --> 01:42:48.353
I've come to believe

01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:54.160
that if you have to turn
your back on your feelings,

01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:58.200
Kururugi-san doesn't get what she wants.

01:43:16.092 --> 01:43:17.354
Kazuma-kun?

01:43:19.236 --> 01:43:21.833
I've decided to study abroad.

01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:25.711
Good to hear.

01:43:32.275 --> 01:43:35.771
Strange, I thought you'd be happier.

01:43:37.722 --> 01:43:38.855
I'm happy.

01:44:23.325 --> 01:44:25.021
Is it that difficult?

01:44:25.541 --> 01:44:28.138
No, it's not difficult at all.

01:44:28.378 --> 01:44:31.553
I want to talk with a lot
of fluent English speakers.

01:44:36.827 --> 01:44:38.538
Isn't it about time?

01:44:51.968 --> 01:44:56.568
I did tell Sakurai-sensei about this.

01:45:03.409 --> 01:45:04.541
Nami-chan.

01:45:05.486 --> 01:45:09.636
I don't think how I feel about
sensei is ever going to change.

01:45:10.715 --> 01:45:14.940
So I'm going to go to
California and study very hard.

01:45:16.266 --> 01:45:20.646
I'll do my best so that he
really falls for me next time.

01:45:25.082 --> 01:45:26.454
Do your best, Yuni!

01:45:27.362 --> 01:45:30.554
I will save money and come
visit you in California!

01:45:51.490 --> 01:45:54.871
Has Kururugi safely made it to California?

01:45:54.874 --> 01:45:56.652
Yes, thank you for asking.

01:45:56.774 --> 01:45:59.376
But the difficulties have only just begun.

01:45:59.377 --> 01:46:01.125
Until she starts classes in September,

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:04.182
she has to attend an English
conversation class.

01:46:04.217 --> 01:46:07.350
But! That's Kururugi Yuni for you!

01:46:07.385 --> 01:46:09.989
In such a short time studying English,

01:46:10.024 --> 01:46:12.594
she got into University of California!

01:46:13.691 --> 01:46:16.344
That's thanks to
Sakurai-sensei's extra lessons.

01:46:23.243 --> 01:46:24.765
Sakurai-sensei!

01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:29.404
Thank you for everything.

01:47:57.415 --> 01:47:58.587
Hello~.

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:06.998
Hello~~.

01:48:07.003 --> 01:48:08.502
Kururugi.

01:48:13.769 --> 01:48:16.678
There's something I really
wanted to show you right away.

01:48:18.285 --> 01:48:19.762
But.. what about university?

01:48:20.522 --> 01:48:22.323
I'm skipping some classes..

01:48:31.593 --> 01:48:33.028
Sensei, come with me.

01:48:38.316 --> 01:48:39.179
Look at that!

01:48:39.214 --> 01:48:40.042
Come here!

01:48:40.126 --> 01:48:41.112
Look, look!

01:48:41.147 --> 01:48:42.098
Who's that?

01:48:43.424 --> 01:48:44.673
What what?

01:48:47.459 --> 01:48:48.810
What what? Who?

01:48:48.811 --> 01:48:50.635
That's Sakurai-sensei, isn't it?

01:48:50.670 --> 01:48:51.893
It IS Sakurai-sensei!

01:48:51.928 --> 01:48:54.482
It's still the middle of
school, why's he leaving?

01:48:54.517 --> 01:48:55.951
Who's the other person?

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:06.820
A blue sunset..

01:49:07.965 --> 01:49:10.292
In English, it's a "blue flash".

01:49:11.052 --> 01:49:13.951
It happens right before the
sun dips below the horizon.

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.822
Though it seems to be extremely rare.

01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:19.814
They really do exist.

01:49:20.008 --> 01:49:21.277
Those blue sunsets.

01:49:23.203 --> 01:49:28.999
I felt that I really had to show you
this in person, no matter what.

01:49:29.347 --> 01:49:33.852
Did you.. come back just
to show this to me?

01:49:35.475 --> 01:49:36.288
Yes.

01:49:44.836 --> 01:49:47.009
Thank you, Kururugi.

01:49:50.046 --> 01:49:51.120
But still,

01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:55.316
it doesn't change the fact
that my dad was lying to me.

01:49:55.557 --> 01:50:01.465
But could it mean that he really wanted you
and the rest of the family to be happy?

01:50:01.797 --> 01:50:04.284
Like why you lied to me.

01:50:13.248 --> 01:50:16.513
I realized after I'd gone so far from you.

01:50:16.677 --> 01:50:23.132
You saying you didn't love me anymore
was a lie to make me to go California.

01:50:26.112 --> 01:50:28.668
That's why I will study more and more,

01:50:29.066 --> 01:50:31.778
and come back to you as
a more suitable person.

01:50:32.713 --> 01:50:36.651
So.. please wait until I've done that.

01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:44.551
I'm sorry, Kururugi.

01:50:47.052 --> 01:50:49.371
I won't lie for your sake anymore.

01:51:12.771 --> 01:51:14.372
Sensei..

01:51:16.316 --> 01:51:17.322
Kururugi.

01:51:20.192 --> 01:51:22.465
I will love you my entire life.

01:51:25.911 --> 01:51:27.034
Let's get married now.

01:51:28.965 --> 01:51:31.894
W..we can't do that right now!

01:51:32.189 --> 01:51:33.248
I'm still..

01:51:34.174 --> 01:51:35.731
You are fine the way you are.

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:39.089
You don't need to leave school.

01:51:41.592 --> 01:51:46.425
I love the Kururugi Yuni that is
standing in front of me right now.

01:51:49.624 --> 01:51:50.900
Sensei..

01:51:52.737 --> 01:51:53.824
Could you possibly.

01:51:55.229 --> 01:51:56.891
Stop calling me that?

01:52:02.722 --> 01:52:03.689
Yuni.

01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:07.251
Come to me.

01:52:15.829 --> 01:52:16.750
Okay!
