WEBVTT

00:19.500 --> 00:22.208
You gonna push me in?

00:27.250 --> 00:29.041
I want my necklace back.

00:29.125 --> 00:32.541
Yeah, I came to give it to you.

00:32.625 --> 00:34.375
Hop on.

00:34.416 --> 00:36.500
I can give you a ride back
to your camp.

00:58.416 --> 00:59.500
Royal!

00:59.583 --> 01:03.083
Royal, where are you taking us?

01:04.708 --> 01:06.000
Royal!

01:07.375 --> 01:09.333
Let me off, Royal!

01:09.416 --> 01:11.625
What are you doing?

01:11.708 --> 01:15.250
Royal, I want to get off now!

01:16.125 --> 01:17.125
Hey!

01:17.958 --> 01:20.125
Stop, I said stop!

01:38.375 --> 01:41.750
- Give me my necklace back.
- Can't do that.

01:41.833 --> 01:44.458
I put it in a vise
and crushed it.

01:44.541 --> 01:46.916
Yeah, you want to know
what happened?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.208
Nothing. How about that?

01:49.291 --> 01:51.416
Your rock was just
a fucking rock.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.833
I don't believe that.

01:52.916 --> 01:54.000
You think,

01:54.083 --> 01:55.125
you think you're getting
closer to something,

01:55.208 --> 01:56.416
but you're not.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.000
The rock had a mineral in it,

01:58.083 --> 01:59.833
- and there's more of it
on your land.

02:01.458 --> 02:03.875
I think it and the hole
are connected,

02:03.958 --> 02:06.291
and I think both
are connected to time.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.541
I think maybe both
are time somehow.

02:08.666 --> 02:10.166
Shut up!

02:10.291 --> 02:11.791
Time's a dimension, right?

02:11.875 --> 02:14.458
Like, length, width, height,
we can see those,

02:14.541 --> 02:16.875
we can touch them,
so why not time?

02:16.958 --> 02:17.958
I don't care.

02:18.041 --> 02:19.916
Amazing things have always

02:20.000 --> 02:21.875
come out of the earth, Royal.

02:21.958 --> 02:24.416
- And maybe
this is just another...
- I don't fucking care.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.375
- Royal...
- No, I told you my family
can't know about any of this.

02:27.458 --> 02:30.083
- I told you that.
- You traveled through time.

02:30.166 --> 02:32.625
It's amazing.
Why can't you tell them?

02:32.708 --> 02:34.500
'Cause they won't understand.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.541
Why won't they understand?

02:36.625 --> 02:39.791
You stay away from my family,

02:39.875 --> 02:43.375
or I will kill you!

02:43.458 --> 02:46.875
I'm going to do
wondrous things.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.333
Wondrous things.

02:48.416 --> 02:50.291
No!

02:50.375 --> 02:53.333
I'm going to help people,
Royal.

02:53.416 --> 02:55.291
Royal.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.166
"Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us"]

02:57.250 --> 02:58.916
Royal.

02:59.958 --> 03:03.750
- Royal.

03:03.833 --> 03:06.208
- Royal.

03:06.291 --> 03:09.125
Royal!

03:11.125 --> 03:13.375
Don't leave me here!

04:13.416 --> 04:15.583
Hi, Kirkland.
Sorry to bother at you at home.

04:15.666 --> 04:17.958
It's all right, Joy. How-how
you doing? What's going on?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.625
I'm ready to make an arrest
in the Tillerson case.

04:20.708 --> 04:23.625
Really? Well, good. Who?

04:23.708 --> 04:25.166
Perry and Rhett Abbott.

04:25.250 --> 04:28.000
Oh, boy.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.833
Trevor was last seen
at The Pit Bar.

04:29.916 --> 04:32.625
Coroner said last thing he ate
was a hamburger, which is what

04:32.708 --> 04:34.541
both his brothers said
he ordered there.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.958
A dishwasher can testify
to seeing Perry Abbott

04:37.041 --> 04:38.416
in the bar parking lot

04:38.500 --> 04:40.791
beating the hell out of Trevor
that same night.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.583
Perry and his brother Rhett

04:42.666 --> 04:44.166
then drove the body

04:44.250 --> 04:47.458
to the edge of their land,
hiked it up the mountain.

04:47.541 --> 04:49.666
Their only alibis
are each other

04:49.750 --> 04:52.291
and their parents,
who are lying.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.083
Later that night,
it rained hard.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.458
That's why the body
and the scene are so clean.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.416
Okay.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.916
Well, it's not gonna be fun
prosecuting the Abbotts.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.291
But... nice work, Joy.

05:11.083 --> 05:14.625
There's one thing that doesn't,
you know, totally fit.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.041
What?

05:16.125 --> 05:18.416
The coroner says Trevor
was only dead eight hours

05:18.500 --> 05:20.125
when Amy Abbott found him,

05:20.208 --> 05:21.791
which, as you know, was

05:21.875 --> 05:23.875
four days after the fight
at The Pit Bar.

05:25.666 --> 05:28.291
So... Perry didn't kill him

05:28.375 --> 05:29.791
in the fight in the parking lot?

05:29.875 --> 05:32.000
No, he did.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.833
Coroner is just... wrong.

05:38.416 --> 05:39.833
Are you fucking kidding me?

05:39.916 --> 05:42.333
No.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.375
I have an election
coming up, too, you know.

05:44.458 --> 05:45.666
I can't touch that.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.125
If you were smart,

05:53.208 --> 05:55.333
you wouldn't touch it either.

05:55.416 --> 05:57.833
Good night, Joy.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.375
Can we do another two-tone?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.333
Okay, come on.

07:18.458 --> 07:20.916
Why was Grandpa sleeping
on the couch?

07:22.333 --> 07:24.666
Um... I don't know.

07:26.208 --> 07:28.333
Probably couldn't sleep
or something.

07:30.916 --> 07:32.875
What?

07:32.958 --> 07:36.750
Everyone in this family
keeps things from each other.

07:36.833 --> 07:41.416
Well, it...

07:41.500 --> 07:44.333
It can be hard to...

07:44.416 --> 07:46.416
explain things or, uh...

07:46.500 --> 07:49.125
or talk about 'em.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.375
Sometimes you keep things

07:50.458 --> 07:52.500
from the people you love
'cause you don't want to,

07:52.583 --> 07:54.083
you don't want to hurt 'em.

07:55.833 --> 07:58.916
Not knowing hurts, too.

08:14.583 --> 08:15.833
Okay.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.750
Morning. Uh, two, please.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.250
Hi, Amy.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.583
Hey.

08:27.666 --> 08:29.541
Perry.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.500
Hey, Joy.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.666
Most merciful
God...

08:35.791 --> 08:36.916
We confess

08:37.000 --> 08:39.250
that we have sinned against You

08:39.333 --> 08:42.083
in thought, word, and deed.

08:42.166 --> 08:45.583
We have not loved You
with our whole heart.

08:45.666 --> 08:48.708
We have not loved others
as You have loved us.

08:48.791 --> 08:51.208
We are truly sorry.

08:51.291 --> 08:55.125
In Your mercy,
forgive what we have been.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.000
The peace of the Lord
be with you.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.833
And also
with you.

08:58.916 --> 09:01.500
Give your neighbor
a sign of peace.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.416
Peace be with you.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.250
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.583
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.500
Hey, Gav.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.750
Hi. Thank you.

09:29.666 --> 09:31.291
Sorry I'm late.

09:32.291 --> 09:36.000
Okay, so we have
some visitors here today.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.625
You all know Sheriff Joy Hawk.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.958
I wanted to welcome her
and her family

09:40.041 --> 09:42.291
to our church. Uh, Joy,

09:42.375 --> 09:43.875
why don't you have
your family stand up,

09:43.958 --> 09:45.791
and we'll say
a little prayer for you.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.666
- Okay, come on.
- Frank?

09:53.458 --> 09:57.000
We ask for Your blessing,
O Lord,

09:57.083 --> 09:58.416
on Sheriff Joy.

09:58.500 --> 10:02.083
And we thank You
for her years of service

10:02.166 --> 10:03.958
in this area, and while

10:04.041 --> 10:06.083
we're all guilty of sin, Lord,

10:06.166 --> 10:08.041
we know that no one is above it,

10:08.125 --> 10:10.333
so I would like
to say a special...

10:10.416 --> 10:13.083
a prayer for Your servant
Joy Hawk

10:13.166 --> 10:15.208
and her friend Martha,

10:15.291 --> 10:18.500
as the sacrament of marriage

10:18.583 --> 10:21.666
is a union between
a man and a woman.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.166
We give them up to You,
and we ask that

10:24.250 --> 10:25.958
she might trust in the goodness

10:26.041 --> 10:27.791
and righteousness

10:27.875 --> 10:29.500
of our Lord.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.583
All right, uh, let's take

10:31.666 --> 10:33.833
- the Lord's Supper.
- Please, stay.

10:50.791 --> 10:52.708
The body and blood

10:52.791 --> 10:54.541
of Your Son's sacrifice.

10:54.625 --> 10:55.750
Bless this bread and wine.

10:55.833 --> 10:57.875
Blood of Christ, shed for you.

11:02.291 --> 11:03.333
Body of Christ.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.583
Body of Christ.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.791
Body of Christ.

11:19.208 --> 11:21.666
Body of Christ.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Body of Christ.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.833
I can't.

13:00.833 --> 13:03.333
Yellow.

13:04.875 --> 13:07.916
Show him.

13:13.041 --> 13:16.541
Show him.

13:54.666 --> 13:57.500
Sorry I didn't call ahead.
Wasn't sure you'd pick up.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.333
You left without
saying anything.

14:01.916 --> 14:05.583
Can we, like, go for a...
walk or something?

14:26.625 --> 14:29.833
Are those from my yard?

14:29.916 --> 14:32.541
Yeah. Sorry.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.458
Oh, God.

14:37.541 --> 14:40.333
Look, I love every second
we're together, okay?

14:40.416 --> 14:42.291
And-and when I woke up
this morning,

14:42.375 --> 14:45.000
I had this wild feeling,

14:45.083 --> 14:47.708
like-like this is it,
this is who I want to be with,

14:47.791 --> 14:49.125
but...

14:49.208 --> 14:51.125
but I want to live my own life,

14:51.208 --> 14:52.458
and I don't want
to live it here.

14:52.541 --> 14:54.375
All right, well, neither do I.
We can do that.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.833
Rhett, you told me
when you were 17,

14:55.916 --> 14:58.250
you were gonna leave that ranch.
You're not gonna leave now.

14:58.333 --> 15:01.166
I'll prove it to you.
Right after the rodeo, let's go.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.500
- No.
- Let's go.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.000
No, because your family's
always gonna

15:04.083 --> 15:05.625
pull you back to them, and-and

15:05.708 --> 15:08.458
that's fine,

15:08.541 --> 15:11.541
but if that's the case, then
I can't afford to be with you.

15:11.625 --> 15:14.250
Then tell me
what you need from me.

15:14.333 --> 15:17.208
- No, you're not
hearing my point.
- What's your point?

15:20.083 --> 15:23.250
Then are you covering
for Perry?

15:28.708 --> 15:30.208
Did he kill him?

15:36.041 --> 15:38.083
No.

15:39.916 --> 15:42.416
No, he didn't have
anything to do with it.

15:43.416 --> 15:46.041
Neither did I.

15:48.333 --> 15:51.833
Wow. If you're gonna lie
about this...

15:54.708 --> 15:57.208
...then I don't know
who you are.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.958
Hey.
Hello. Luke?

16:32.041 --> 16:34.208
Yeah.
You're on speaker.

16:34.291 --> 16:35.541
I got my mother with me.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.583
- How's Wayne doing today?
- Uh... well,

16:37.666 --> 16:40.500
he can't move, can't speak,
and can't feed himself,

16:40.583 --> 16:42.625
so not good.

16:42.708 --> 16:44.666
Sorry to hear that.

16:44.750 --> 16:46.083
Doing our best
to prepare ourselves

16:46.166 --> 16:47.500
for the worst over here.

16:47.583 --> 16:48.500
Okay, well,

16:48.583 --> 16:50.000
I have the latest draft

16:50.083 --> 16:52.291
of Wayne's will
in front of me.

16:52.375 --> 16:53.666
I'm looking at it now.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.833
Okay. Um, what's it say?

16:55.916 --> 16:59.083
If Wayne passes, he wants
the land and business holdings,

16:59.166 --> 17:02.250
everything, to go to
your brother, Billy.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.125
Hi.

17:06.208 --> 17:08.625
This is Patricia.

17:08.708 --> 17:09.958
Oh, yes. Hello.

17:10.041 --> 17:12.083
- It's been a while.
- Yes.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.500
- These are hard circumstances.
- Yes.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.708
Still, this...

17:16.791 --> 17:18.708
is surprising.

17:18.791 --> 17:21.083
I know. The will
hasn't been executed,

17:21.166 --> 17:22.541
but Wayne's wishes
are very clear.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.916
We understand.
We'd love to see a current draft

17:25.000 --> 17:26.291
of the will. I know
it hasn't been ratified,

17:26.375 --> 17:27.375
still, would you send us a copy?

17:27.458 --> 17:29.458
- Yes.
- Today.

17:29.541 --> 17:32.375
Thank you so much. It was nice
speaking to you again.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.333
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.458
Uh-uh.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.583
There we go.

17:47.666 --> 17:50.833
Sorry. Work stuff.
Hi, baby girl.

17:52.333 --> 17:53.500
I was just pouring over

17:53.583 --> 17:54.958
the coroner's report, I just...

17:55.041 --> 17:56.458
Let's go over to the sandbox.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.333
I'm sorry, this case
is just driving me insane,

18:02.416 --> 18:03.625
and I'm...

18:05.250 --> 18:08.166
I'm one step closer
to solving this thing,

18:08.250 --> 18:10.625
and everything lines up
except for this report...

18:10.708 --> 18:12.625
Stop.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.541
I don't care about
the goddamn case.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.166
I felt like a puppet up there.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.250
We just got dragged
into this because...

18:23.333 --> 18:25.750
I need your support.
This campaign, the case.

18:25.833 --> 18:27.791
If winning this campaign

18:27.875 --> 18:30.250
means humiliating your family,

18:30.333 --> 18:32.500
then that's not something
I want to support.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.416
Okay.

18:47.041 --> 18:48.750
I'm gonna handle the lawyer.
This'll go away.

18:48.833 --> 18:52.500
Billy will never know.
It's not been executed.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.291
- The will's not binding.
- I don't know.

18:54.375 --> 18:57.875
Baby, Billy is not capable.

18:57.958 --> 19:00.875
- You are.
- Okay.

19:00.958 --> 19:02.291
- You are.
- Yeah.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.625
- You are.
- I am.

19:04.708 --> 19:08.083
I'll only be gone a few days,
just till the benefit's done.

19:08.166 --> 19:11.166
- It's just Aspen.
I won't be far.
- It's fine.

19:11.250 --> 19:14.333
What? Oh, my God,
don't fuck me up.

19:14.416 --> 19:15.958
If you fuck me up,
I'm gonna be so mad.

19:16.041 --> 19:17.375
- I won't.

19:17.458 --> 19:20.291
Okay, that's enough,
that's enough, that's enough.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.458
- Yeah, what are you, five?

19:22.541 --> 19:24.541
- Mom.
- Two?

19:30.666 --> 19:32.791
You're so pretty.

19:48.541 --> 19:51.041
I'm gonna take an elk for Dad.

20:38.041 --> 20:41.083
I want to show you something.

20:46.666 --> 20:47.916
Okay.

21:01.166 --> 21:03.708
Once upon a time,

21:03.791 --> 21:06.125
long ago,

21:06.208 --> 21:08.833
there was a young astrologer.

21:08.916 --> 21:11.791
He'd walk the land,

21:11.875 --> 21:14.375
gazing up at the sky,

21:14.458 --> 21:17.500
marveling at the movement
of the heavens.

21:17.583 --> 21:19.625
His eyes

21:19.708 --> 21:23.750
were always fixed
on what was above him,

21:23.833 --> 21:27.166
so much so

21:27.250 --> 21:29.541
that, often...

21:32.416 --> 21:35.416
...he would stumble
when he walked.

21:37.750 --> 21:40.541
One day,

21:40.625 --> 21:43.375
the stumbling astrologer

21:43.458 --> 21:45.750
tripped,

21:45.833 --> 21:49.333
and he fell into a well.

21:50.875 --> 21:55.041
And soon, his mother,
who was a wise old woman,

21:55.125 --> 21:57.875
she found him
at the bottom of the well.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.041
And she said to him...

22:03.458 --> 22:05.000
well...

22:07.208 --> 22:10.625
"How do you expect to know
what's in the heavens,

22:10.708 --> 22:15.250
if you can't see

22:15.333 --> 22:18.375
what's at your feet?"

22:39.708 --> 22:41.625
- [

23:07.500 --> 23:08.625
- Whoa!

23:08.708 --> 23:10.708
- Oh, shit!

23:19.750 --> 23:23.041
You seen
your grandmother around?

23:23.125 --> 23:24.958
No. Not since church.

23:25.041 --> 23:28.000
Maybe she took the dogs
to the creek?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.500
Mm-hmm.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.083
Mm, probably.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.541
Uh, you want a sandwich?

23:39.583 --> 23:41.833
No, thanks.

23:41.916 --> 23:44.416
I'm gonna go see
where she got to.

23:55.416 --> 23:57.583
Okay.

23:57.666 --> 23:59.166
Okay.

24:00.916 --> 24:02.250
Okay.

24:50.833 --> 24:52.666
Cecilia?

24:54.541 --> 24:56.541
Yeah?

24:57.750 --> 24:58.916
Can I come in?

25:01.625 --> 25:03.500
I want to be alone.

25:08.208 --> 25:09.541
What are you doing?

25:12.208 --> 25:13.875
Are you okay?

25:22.875 --> 25:24.791
Hey, um...

25:29.666 --> 25:33.500
You remember that time
we drove down to Jubilee Days?

25:36.333 --> 25:38.458
It was before Perry,
I think, and...

25:38.541 --> 25:40.208
I found a special way
for us to go,

25:40.291 --> 25:42.041
'cause you said you wanted
to do a scenic route.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.750
You had that map in your lap.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.666
You kept saying
it wasn't the right way.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.750
I said, "Don't worry.

25:54.833 --> 25:56.666
We're all good."

26:02.583 --> 26:04.583
We got so lost.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.500
You know, I wouldn't ask
for directions.

26:15.666 --> 26:18.583
But you found the right way.

26:18.666 --> 26:20.541
You got us there.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.916
And you never said a word
about it.

26:31.708 --> 26:34.041
I'd be lost without you.

26:37.666 --> 26:39.833
That's the God's honest truth.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.125
Just...

26:52.208 --> 26:54.625
just really need to be alone.

27:02.625 --> 27:04.208
Okay.

27:32.166 --> 27:35.333
You were right
about the west pasture, Dad.

28:16.583 --> 28:19.625
I have no money. I have
no clothes. I have no place...

28:19.708 --> 28:21.250
It's none of your
goddamn business what happened.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.541
You have one job and that's to
send me money when I need it.

28:22.625 --> 28:25.625
We don't have
any lamotrigine in stock.

28:25.708 --> 28:26.958
Um, is the generic okay?

28:27.041 --> 28:29.083
Sure, Jennifer,
whatever works for you.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.458
Because it's only my brain,
so...

28:32.500 --> 28:33.666
Room 210.

28:36.416 --> 28:37.958
I need to see you.

28:39.166 --> 28:40.750
No, no, no, right now.

29:30.250 --> 29:32.250
I'm not saying
it didn't happen.

29:32.333 --> 29:33.833
I'm just...

29:33.916 --> 29:36.708
Our family's
been through a lot.

29:36.791 --> 29:38.958
My dad's under a lot
of pressure because...

29:39.041 --> 29:40.500
He's under a lot of pressure?

29:40.583 --> 29:42.208
Whose fault is that? He's the
one causing all the trouble.

29:42.291 --> 29:43.500
I'm talking about murder,
Perry.

29:43.583 --> 29:46.125
Attempted murder.
You can't justify that.

29:46.208 --> 29:48.500
- I'm just trying...
- Your father snapped.

29:48.583 --> 29:50.208
It's that simple. You
didn't see the look in his eye.

29:50.291 --> 29:51.541
It was, like, feral.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.708
Can we please get
some more coffee?

29:55.583 --> 29:57.125
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised

29:57.208 --> 29:58.791
if this is exactly
what happened to Trevor.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.791
Poor guy probably did
something, said something,

30:00.875 --> 30:02.708
triggered some weird thing
and your father just snapped.

30:02.791 --> 30:04.208
- Did you want some...
- Yes, yes,

30:04.291 --> 30:07.166
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

30:08.250 --> 30:09.875
No, thanks.

30:13.458 --> 30:15.416
I know that this must be hard
for you.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.375
I get it.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.833
I get you.

30:20.916 --> 30:23.250
I mean, we're on the same
wavelength, don't you think?

30:26.416 --> 30:27.833
Yes.

30:29.041 --> 30:30.375
I do.

30:31.375 --> 30:33.458
That's why I'm trying
to help you.

30:33.541 --> 30:36.791
There are things
that are happening

30:36.875 --> 30:39.791
that are connected to you

30:39.875 --> 30:42.583
and they're connected to me

30:42.666 --> 30:45.625
and they're connected
to Rebecca.

30:50.833 --> 30:52.166
I know that it's hard to accept

30:52.250 --> 30:54.250
this kind of darkness
in your own family, Perry,

30:54.333 --> 30:55.583
but it is essential,

30:55.666 --> 30:57.208
it is essential that you do.

30:59.416 --> 31:02.333
I mean, if Royal tries
the same thing again, I...

31:02.416 --> 31:03.625
I'm helpless.

31:03.708 --> 31:04.791
What am I supposed to do?

31:04.875 --> 31:05.958
Hey. You don't have
to do anything...

31:06.041 --> 31:07.708
No, your father left me
for dead!

31:07.791 --> 31:10.916
It was horrifying,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.333
but it was...

31:13.416 --> 31:15.833
it was transcendent.

31:17.541 --> 31:19.875
You know what?

31:19.958 --> 31:22.791
It was clarity.

31:24.458 --> 31:26.875
That's what it was.
It was clarity.

31:28.166 --> 31:31.166
And this, this is...

31:31.250 --> 31:33.000
the new beginning.

31:33.083 --> 31:34.416
And the best thing to do,

31:34.500 --> 31:36.000
the very best thing to do,

31:36.083 --> 31:39.083
would be to go to the sheriff
and tell her everything.

31:39.166 --> 31:40.541
Royal killed Trevor.

31:40.625 --> 31:42.458
I saw him dispose the body.

31:42.541 --> 31:44.416
I saw it with my own eyes.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.875
- So either you can do it
or I will.
- Shh, shh. Shh.

31:46.958 --> 31:49.041
- Quiet. Time to quiet down.
- You lay it all out.

31:49.125 --> 31:51.166
Quiet. Quiet down now.

31:51.250 --> 31:54.500
We lay it all out
for the sheriff.

31:54.583 --> 31:57.208
Leave the police out of it.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.791
I can handle this, okay?

32:03.250 --> 32:04.750
Okay.

32:04.833 --> 32:06.583
'Kay.

32:11.708 --> 32:14.833
I knew that it would help
to see you, Perry.

32:14.916 --> 32:16.833
I knew.

32:17.958 --> 32:20.041
This is the new beginning.

32:23.541 --> 32:26.208
It's
the new beginning.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.333
Is it death?

34:01.958 --> 34:04.041
Well, what, then?

34:06.916 --> 34:09.541
It's time, Billy.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.916
It's all of time.

34:15.208 --> 34:17.958
It's just sitting there,
waiting for us.

34:20.750 --> 34:24.000
There's a pattern
to everything happening here.

34:24.083 --> 34:27.000
It gets clearer every day.

34:27.083 --> 34:29.833
And slowly

34:29.916 --> 34:31.875
but surely...

34:34.125 --> 34:37.958
...that pattern's moving
everything my way.

34:51.125 --> 34:52.708
Hmm.

35:01.666 --> 35:02.833
Will you get
the cups, Rhett?

35:02.916 --> 35:03.833
Yeah.

35:16.583 --> 35:17.875
Dinner's ready.

35:32.541 --> 35:33.958
Dear Father...

35:53.750 --> 35:54.875
What, Perry?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.166
I confessed.

35:59.250 --> 36:00.833
Confessed?

36:00.916 --> 36:02.708
What would you need
to confess about?

36:02.791 --> 36:04.250
What are
you talking about?

36:04.333 --> 36:06.541
I left a letter
for the sheriff.

36:06.625 --> 36:09.208
I took the blame for all of it.

36:09.291 --> 36:11.416
Everyone else is off the hook.

36:12.416 --> 36:14.791
- Fuck you.
- Hey.

36:17.250 --> 36:18.291
Perry...
After all we did

36:18.375 --> 36:19.833
- to protect you?
- I took the blame

36:19.916 --> 36:21.291
to protect you.

36:21.375 --> 36:23.041
- What the hell?
- To protect everyone.

36:23.125 --> 36:24.291
- Perry...
- You're all safe now.

36:24.375 --> 36:25.916
There's no telling
what the cops will find

36:26.000 --> 36:27.625
now that they know it's on us.

36:27.708 --> 36:29.458
- What are you talking about?
- Amy, stop.
- Go upstairs.

36:29.541 --> 36:31.125
- Go upstairs.
- Go now.

36:31.208 --> 36:33.333
- Fuck you!

36:33.416 --> 36:34.958
Maybe our parents
are protected!

36:35.041 --> 36:37.750
But the sheriff knows
that we left that bar together!

36:37.833 --> 36:39.500
You have no idea

36:39.583 --> 36:41.583
- what I have given up
to protect you!
- No. Hey. Grab Amy!

36:41.666 --> 36:43.541
- I'm sorry.
- Don't say
you're fucking sorry to me!

36:43.625 --> 36:45.208
- It's no wonder
Rebecca left you.

36:45.291 --> 36:46.750
You selfish piece of shit.

36:46.833 --> 36:49.750
You're the reason
Amy doesn't have a fucking mom!

36:52.208 --> 36:54.166
He didn't mean that, Perry.
Don't let that get...

36:56.250 --> 36:58.416
Come on, grab him.
Come on. Come on, grab him.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.500
- Get out of here.
- Perry!

37:00.583 --> 37:01.583
All right, come here.

37:01.666 --> 37:02.833
- Perry!

37:02.916 --> 37:04.916
Royal! Royal!

37:05.000 --> 37:06.583
- Get in here!

37:06.666 --> 37:08.791
- Get him off!
- Fuck!

37:08.875 --> 37:10.875
Oh!

37:12.666 --> 37:15.375
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.375
Okay.

37:17.458 --> 37:18.666
- No, Perry.
- Come on.

37:18.750 --> 37:19.916
- Come on, Rhett.
- Put that down.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.500
- Come on. You want to...
- Put that down!

37:21.583 --> 37:23.375
- ...take this knife,
push it in?!
- Yeah!

37:23.458 --> 37:25.125
Push it in!
Come on, you son of a bitch!

37:25.208 --> 37:26.875
- We'd all be better off!
- You want to fucking kill me?!

37:26.958 --> 37:28.500
- Perry...
- Huh?!

37:28.583 --> 37:30.208
I did it for Dad!

37:30.291 --> 37:32.291
- What? Oh, no.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.583
I did it for Dad.

37:33.666 --> 37:35.166
Autumn was gonna tell
the sheriff.

37:35.250 --> 37:38.166
- What'd you say?
- Autumn was going
to the police.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.708
- Gonna tell 'em what?
- She was gonna tell 'em

37:40.791 --> 37:42.541
that you tried to kill her

37:42.625 --> 37:45.291
- and that she saw you
with Trevor's body!
- Perry...

37:45.375 --> 37:47.708
How many times did I tell you
to stay away from her? How...

37:47.791 --> 37:49.916
- Dad!
- How many times
did I tell you?!

37:55.333 --> 37:56.625
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

37:56.708 --> 37:59.375
- Ow. Ow.

38:02.583 --> 38:05.000
Amy.

38:26.458 --> 38:28.458
"High on a Rocky Ledge"]
