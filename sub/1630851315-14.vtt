Maggie Shaw? Your best friend?

00:15.406 --> 00:16.886
You are under arrest

00:16.929 --> 00:18.583
for espionage and treason.

00:18.627 --> 00:21.021
You broke my heart, Maggie.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.848
I know, Janey.

00:22.892 --> 00:25.286
Did something happen
to Aunt Maggie?

00:25.329 --> 00:27.636
She won't be
coming around anymore.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.941
Are you all right?

00:30.682 --> 00:33.207
No, baby.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.643
I'm really, I'm really not.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.732

Sort of wasn't

Plenty of time

01:49.370 --> 01:51.154
Looks like
evidence of a good time.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.417
Yeah, Marines training out
of K-Bay got the morning off.

01:53.461 --> 01:56.203
They were playing volleyball
when they experienced head pain,

01:56.246 --> 01:58.205
bleeding from the
ears and vertigo.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.771
A few of them
lost consciousness.

01:59.815 --> 02:02.165
They've all been sent
to Tripler for treatment.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.688
Those are
Fleet Marine Forces Corpsmen.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.255
Were the people affected
Spec Ops?

02:05.299 --> 02:07.170
Marine Special Operations Team.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.651
Some are operators,
the rest enablers.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.653
Everything from
intel to logistics.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.916
Nobody else on the
beach was affected.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.787
We need to rule out
anything mission related:

02:15.831 --> 02:19.487
rapid cabin depressurization,
viruses, parasites, et cetera.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.010
I'll check with
their commander,

02:21.053 --> 02:23.099
but I got to say, I hate
to root for parasites.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.408
I ever tell you how
much I hate hospitals?

02:27.451 --> 02:29.279
I had this
infection as a kid,

02:29.323 --> 02:31.151
and I spent the whole week
eating crappy food

02:31.194 --> 02:32.674
and hooked up
to machines.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.850
The only good thing
are the nurses.

02:34.893 --> 02:37.548
And, you know, not dying.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.507
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, Luce.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.596
Uh, I'm sorry that
happened to you.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.250
And I'm sorry
I'm distracted.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.513
It's just-- doesn't she
work with dead people?

02:46.557 --> 02:50.213
I am a student of the human
body, soul intact or not.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.955
My last paper was on the effect
of environmental factors

02:52.998 --> 02:56.132
on the external auditory meatus
and tympanic membranes.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.438
That's
a lot of words.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.048
Eardrums.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.311
I wanted to see
if meditative chants can heal.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.880
Any idea what caused
their injuries?

03:04.923 --> 03:08.666
I have a "bad news, good news,
more bad news" situation.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.886
What, uh, order
do you want it in?

03:10.929 --> 03:13.497
I'm sorry,
was it one bad, two good?

03:13.541 --> 03:15.586
I'm still hung up on
"auditory meatus."

03:15.630 --> 03:17.109
Your order is fine.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.460
Okay, bad news:
There are a scary number

03:19.503 --> 03:21.505
of natural reasons
why ears bleed.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.986
Good news: None of them
are what happened here.

03:24.029 --> 03:27.685
Bad news: I believe it might be
some sort of ultrasonic wave

03:27.729 --> 03:29.165
that disturbed
the inner ear canal,

03:29.209 --> 03:32.603
creating vertigo-like symptoms.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.998
So, sound waves caused our
victims to bleed and collapse?

03:36.041 --> 03:37.826
Yes.
How?

03:37.869 --> 03:40.263
Well, it wasn't naturally
occurring, something like

03:40.307 --> 03:42.787
a meteorite creating an
impact wave right next to them.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.528
I suspect they would have
noticed that.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.704
So it was man-made,

03:46.748 --> 03:49.185
like sound waves
were weaponized.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.101
Everything can be weaponized,
Agent Boone.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.450
Even love.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.540
And what'll happen
to our victims?

03:56.584 --> 03:58.586
They'll recover completely.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.457
But if they'd been
exposed any longer,

04:00.501 --> 04:02.198
they might have lost
their hearing.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.634
Or worse.

04:10.772 --> 04:13.122
Special Agent Tennant.

04:13.165 --> 04:15.733
FBI Special
Agent Whistler.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.300
You saved me a call.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.997
I wanted to congratulate you
on the new gig.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.608
When do you start?

04:20.651 --> 04:22.566
Just got my photo taken
for my new credentials.

04:22.610 --> 04:23.654
Pick them up tomorrow.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.656
DIA's gonna miss you.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.615
But if I'm being honest...

04:27.658 --> 04:28.964
Please.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.226
...I'm so glad
you'll no longer be

04:30.270 --> 04:31.358
coming in hot
with red tape.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.274
Yeah, I deserve that.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.101
Still, I hope it doesn't mean
we'll be seeing any less of you.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.799
Yeah, I think
the Bureau liked that I had

04:37.842 --> 04:39.801
a good working relationship
with you and your team.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.890
Well, they're lucky to have you.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.021
I should get to my meeting.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.285
I know. I brought you a coffee.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.288
It'll be a long day.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.118
Glen Smith is in charge
of the inquiry.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.250
Bulldog.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.340
Don't say anything
you shouldn't, Kate.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.733
Well, like I said,

04:58.776 --> 05:00.952
haven't gotten
my official credentials yet.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.955
He'll try to make you
doubt yourself.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.436
Don't let him.
Don't forget who you really are.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.397
Have a good day,
Special Agent in Charge Tennant.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.748
You, too, FBI Special
Agent Whistler.

05:14.749 --> 05:18.013
Molecules push and pull
as a sound wave moves.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.189
Increase the amplitude,

05:20.232 --> 05:23.714
and these opposing forces can
create bubbles in the inner ear.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.760
This is called cavitation,

05:25.803 --> 05:28.458
a disruption in the ear canal
that can cause fatigue,

05:28.502 --> 05:30.460
nausea, even collapse.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.680
So, it's bad.
Well, bad" works, but

05:32.723 --> 05:35.160
cavitation makes it sound like
I know what I'm talking about.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.380
Also, the waves
are directional.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.600
Given that nobody else
on the beach was affected,

05:39.643 --> 05:42.037
whoever did this
was targeting our Marines.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.996
Kai, Luce, what info
do we have on the unit?

05:47.477 --> 05:49.305
What?

05:49.349 --> 05:52.569
Acting SAC Boone's time to shine
while Tennant's out of pocket.

05:52.613 --> 05:55.006
Mm. You did that
so effortlessly.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.922
One of you just tell me what
the unit's C.O. said, please.

05:57.966 --> 06:00.447
Yeah. They just returned
from a two-month mission

06:00.490 --> 06:02.449
supporting local forces
against Jemaah

06:02.492 --> 06:04.146
Islamiyah in
Southeast Asia.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.843
I checked the dark web.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.280
None of the Spec Ops team
or their enablers were doxed.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.718
- We have any anomalies?
- Just heard back.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.590
One of the unit's members hasn't
checked in since the attack.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.070
Gunnery Sergeant Bryan Shepherd.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.899
He have any issues
with the team?

06:17.942 --> 06:19.901
C.O. didn't knowof any.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.642
Let's circle back
to the Marines at Tripler,

06:21.685 --> 06:24.035
see if they had any trouble
with Shepherd, and, Ernie,

06:24.079 --> 06:25.863
see if you can
- track him down.
- I already got it.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.518
Bryan's not your guy.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.999
You found that in ten seconds.
How do you know?

06:33.218 --> 06:34.524
Because he was
found unconscious

06:34.568 --> 06:36.396
in a car that
swerved off the road.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.616
Checked into the hospital
with a bad case of cavitation.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.445
Luce, you up to confronting your
disdain for hospitals again?

06:42.489 --> 06:44.621
Oof. Okay.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.407
Ernie, Kai, find me a
suspect, what caused this,

06:47.450 --> 06:49.234
anything.
Sir, yes, sir.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.848
Uh, hey. You don't think

06:53.891 --> 06:56.503
Tennant's gonna lose
her security clearance, do you?

06:56.546 --> 06:59.027
No way she crossed any line
that would make it necessary.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.594
Well, I-I hope
you're right,

07:00.637 --> 07:03.640
but what would happen
if she did?

07:03.684 --> 07:05.599
We don't need
to go there right now.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.383
She couldn't keep her job,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.777
- could she?
- You're not gonna let this go, are you, Luce?

07:09.820 --> 07:12.301
No, no, I-I will. And...

07:12.344 --> 07:15.260
could be losing a job
isn't as bad as

07:15.304 --> 07:17.393
being betrayed by

07:17.437 --> 07:19.656
someone you care about.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.179
Hard to bounce back
from that.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.813
Special Agent in Charge Tennant,
right on time.

07:45.856 --> 07:49.164
I'm Glen Smith, with the CIA's
Office of the Inspector General,

07:49.207 --> 07:51.732
and these are my colleagues
Mr. Norwood,

07:51.775 --> 07:53.647
Ms. Cartwright, Mr. Hanson,
and Ms. Logan.

07:53.690 --> 07:54.735
Hello.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.870
Do you need anything
before we begin?

07:59.914 --> 08:01.393
No.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.744
Then why don't you sit down,
and let's get started.

08:07.878 --> 08:10.054
I've prepared a statement.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.536
I met Maggie Shaw

08:13.580 --> 08:15.973
in March 2007 and remained
in contact with her

08:16.017 --> 08:17.845
until two weeks ago,

08:17.888 --> 08:20.238
when my team discovered
she had been compromised and...

08:20.282 --> 08:21.849
Special Agent
Tennant?

08:21.892 --> 08:23.415
Yes.

08:23.459 --> 08:24.939
I appreciate the trouble
you went to

08:24.982 --> 08:26.157
collecting
your thoughts,

08:26.201 --> 08:30.553
but I would like
to approach this...

08:30.597 --> 08:32.773
a slightly
different way.

08:43.305 --> 08:47.135
Bryan's the healthiest
person I know.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.702
Now they've induced him
into a coma

08:48.745 --> 08:50.704
to alleviate the pressure
in his skull.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.444
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

08:52.488 --> 08:54.838
He was supposed to play
volleyball this morning.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.884
Um... h-he called me to say

08:56.927 --> 08:58.799
he had a headache
and was coming home.

09:00.235 --> 09:03.412
At first, the-the doctors
thought this was an aneurysm.

09:03.455 --> 09:06.284
Since you guys
are here, I assume...

09:06.328 --> 09:08.852
We believe he was
the victim of an attack.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.376
This has to do with
the fact we're Spec Ops.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.770
- "We're"?
- He's a comms specialist.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.599
- I'm operational logistics.
- We met

09:16.643 --> 09:18.383
taking shelter
as 60 mike-mikes

09:18.427 --> 09:20.342
were raining down
on our position.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.083
Heck of a meet-cute.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.738
Who would have done this?

09:26.348 --> 09:29.133
Who would have targeted Bryan
and our friends?

09:31.483 --> 09:33.485
Bryan Shepherd wasn't one <i>
of the targets.</i>

09:33.529 --> 09:35.575
He was <i>the</i> target.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.709
No, no, no, no.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.711
This is much too important
for shoulder hovering.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.845
With ultrasonic waves,

09:44.888 --> 09:47.151
the biological effects
depends on

09:47.195 --> 09:49.371
proximity and direction.
In other words,

09:49.414 --> 09:51.634
the closer and more
straight-on the victims,

09:51.678 --> 09:53.027
the more they're impacted.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.376
To be inconspicuous,

09:54.419 --> 09:56.596
the attack would
have to originate

09:56.639 --> 09:58.772
from a car
in the parking lot.

09:58.815 --> 10:01.122
If Bryan was hit
walking to the beach,

10:01.165 --> 10:03.864
he would have felt
the symptoms first.

10:03.907 --> 10:06.954
He left with a headache
before he even got to the court,

10:06.997 --> 10:09.434
and-and with the trees,
it might've taken a few minutes

10:09.478 --> 10:12.350
for the attacker to realize
Bryan went back to his car.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.265
Meanwhile, the people
playing volleyball

10:14.309 --> 10:15.702
are still in the path,

10:15.745 --> 10:17.312
collapsing with
relatively minor symptoms,

10:17.355 --> 10:19.619
but 15 minutes later,

10:19.662 --> 10:21.403
Bryan drives his car
off the road,

10:21.446 --> 10:23.448
ends up in a coma.

10:23.492 --> 10:26.234
The MARSOC team really was
just collateral damage.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.889
- Told you.
- Any way to track the attacker?

10:28.932 --> 10:31.456
I checked traffic cams and
looked for social media video

10:31.500 --> 10:34.590
of the accident-- nothing, but I
may be able to track the weapon.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.723
I know someone with
a DARPA research lab

10:36.766 --> 10:39.029
on the island.
You want to come with?

10:39.073 --> 10:42.163
Like... a science lab?

10:42.206 --> 10:45.645
I think Jesse might need
my help upstairs.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.690
Fine. I'll ask Lucy.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.084
She'll appreciate the ingenuity.

10:50.127 --> 10:53.522
Come on, Ernie. I-I will go
with you if you want.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.959
Luddite.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.920
When you joined NCIS,

10:59.963 --> 11:02.836
how often did you and
Ms. Shaw see each other?

11:02.879 --> 11:05.142
I was based in Norfolk, and...

11:05.186 --> 11:06.709
I guess, whenever
she was in D.C.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.058
Did she initiate contact,

11:08.102 --> 11:09.669
or did you?

11:09.712 --> 11:11.105
"Contact"...

11:11.148 --> 11:14.064
feels loaded.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.718
We had lunch.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.765
Sometimes dinner.
Like friends.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.201
What did you talk about?

11:20.244 --> 11:22.159
Work

11:22.203 --> 11:24.466
and family.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.207
Like friends.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.122
Did she ever
come to your home?

11:28.165 --> 11:29.471
Yes.

11:29.514 --> 11:30.515
How often?

11:30.559 --> 11:32.082
However often friends come over.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.345
Did you ever vacation together?

11:34.389 --> 11:35.564
Yes.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.958
We went to the Poconos once,

11:38.001 --> 11:39.481
and to New York

11:39.524 --> 11:41.483
with my son

11:41.526 --> 11:42.963
to see <i>The Lion King.</i>

11:43.006 --> 11:45.400
When did you go to Mexico?

11:47.184 --> 11:49.360
Look, I know
this falls under the

11:49.404 --> 11:53.060
"you ask the questions,
not me" category, but...

11:53.103 --> 11:55.584
can I ask why is this important?

11:59.588 --> 12:02.983
A Chinese MSS asset,

12:03.026 --> 12:04.636
posing as a diplomat,

12:04.680 --> 12:08.379
was in Mexico the same time
as you and Ms. Shaw.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.860
A week later, the U.S. suffered

12:10.904 --> 12:13.210
a DDoS attack

12:13.254 --> 12:16.648
and came very close
to compromising key facilities.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.789
I haven't seen the tall one

12:26.833 --> 12:30.271
around acting
goofy recently.

12:30.314 --> 12:34.275
Uh... we're sort of done.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.756
Not sort of--
really, really done.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.323
- Oh, I'm sorry, Lucy.
- Thanks.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.456
Uh, we-we weren't together
that long,

12:41.499 --> 12:43.458
so I'm hopingto just

12:43.501 --> 12:44.676
move on.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.767
Sh-Should be easy, right?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.246
If it was easy,

12:49.290 --> 12:52.423
none of it would've
mattered, right?

12:52.467 --> 12:54.643
Oh, yeah.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.082
Ooh.

12:59.126 --> 13:02.477
These all must've just come back
from the TechConnect conference.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.958
And am I supposed
to be seeing this?

13:05.001 --> 13:06.611
This isn't the
Ark of the Covenant.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.875
Besides, all the really
classified stuff is locked away.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.268
Oh, wow. What does
this one do?
No, hey.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.618
Look but don't touch.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.707
I thought you said we were
meeting your friend.

13:15.751 --> 13:18.493
I see you shiver
with antici...

13:19.755 --> 13:20.669
...pation.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.367
Wow, that was
quite an entrance.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.629
Thanks for noticing.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.110
Lucy, meet Dr. Tony Lee.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.852
So, what brings you up from
the dungeon to the palace?

13:29.896 --> 13:32.202
To ask questions about weapons

13:32.246 --> 13:34.639
that are capable of
directional ultrasonic waves

13:34.683 --> 13:36.032
that result in cavitation.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.947
Smart cookie, this one.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.297
I do have
a project.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.777
It's right up your alley.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.866
Unfortunately,
it's need-to-know.
Mm.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.955
Written approval.

13:47.435 --> 13:50.133
Oh, thank goodness, 'cause I've
been dying to talk about it.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.135
Come on.

13:52.179 --> 13:53.876
People saw the initial

13:53.920 --> 13:56.400
Havana syndrome
incident of 2016

13:56.444 --> 13:59.273
as a medical anomaly,
but I received funding

13:59.316 --> 14:01.753
to reverse-engineer a weapon

14:01.797 --> 14:04.495
that could cause those injuries.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.106
I've been waiting

14:06.149 --> 14:08.673
for the right time to reveal it,
so mum's the word, okay?

14:08.717 --> 14:10.937
Is this capable of emitting
waves up to 50 yards?

14:10.980 --> 14:12.634
More.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.595
All right, what happened?

14:19.162 --> 14:21.382
This hasn't left the lab.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.732
Well, then we're gonna
need a list

14:23.775 --> 14:25.821
of everyone involved
in its development.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.868
Sorry, Tony, looks like someone
stole your thunder.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.850
What are you looking at?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.070
A vacation photo.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.942
- Ooh, am I in it?
- No.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.511
Mm.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.426
I went to Mexico
when you were little.

15:05.469 --> 15:08.646
With Aunt Maggie. Yeah.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.694
Did you have
a good time?

15:12.737 --> 15:14.957
Yes.

15:15.001 --> 15:18.526
We had a very
good time.

15:18.569 --> 15:21.964
We haven't seen her
for a while.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.531
Is she out of town?

15:26.490 --> 15:27.927
Yeah.

15:29.406 --> 15:32.061
For a while.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.934
If you talk to her,
tell her I love her

15:34.977 --> 15:37.414
and that she owes me
53 cents.

15:38.502 --> 15:41.897
From playing cards.
Of course.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.597
Dinner will be
ready soon, okay?
Okay.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.425
And did you finish
your homework?

15:48.469 --> 15:50.645
- Mostly.
- Mm-hmm.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.822
Well, why don't you turn that
"mostly" into a "yes."
Okay.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.321
Dr. Lee sent along the list

16:14.364 --> 16:16.540
of everyone who has access

16:16.584 --> 16:18.803
to the sound wave
weapon schematics.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.067
That's a lot of people.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.677
106, to be exact.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.027
From project directors
to research assistants.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.855
So, I narrowed it down
by certain criteria.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.988
Like who's a
vindictive maniac?

16:29.031 --> 16:30.467
That's not far off, actually.

16:30.511 --> 16:33.775
Like being let go
for disruptive behavior at work.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.127
Joel Johnson.
A contractor.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.564
Lost his clearance
and his job about a month ago.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.653
- We know why?
- No, not yet.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.656
- Waiting on personnel records.
- We know where he's at?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.615
Ernie tracked
his cell phone.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.270
Apparently, he's been
bouncing around Airbnbs,

16:50.313 --> 16:53.708
but the most recent place
is just south of Kailua.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.449
And get this,

16:55.492 --> 16:57.755
the reservations are under
a different name each time.

16:57.799 --> 17:00.106
Would an innocent person
do that?

17:00.149 --> 17:03.631
Not unless they were
a celebrity or a sociopath.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.154
Let's go pay him a visit.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.441
He's not in the house.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.747
Jesse? Lucy?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.357
Where are you guys?

17:39.623 --> 17:41.451
Call for a bus, now!

17:50.852 --> 17:56.118
Om...

17:56.162 --> 17:58.207
I'm s-- I'm sorry.
What-what are you doing?

17:58.251 --> 18:00.166
Oh, good. You do hear me.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.168
Your equilibrium is off,

18:02.211 --> 18:04.083
but you'll be centered
soon enough.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.215
Your exposure
was limited.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.478
You may have a headache
for a bit, but I can recommend

18:08.522 --> 18:10.698
some mantras that'll
help heal the aural canal.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.613
How you feeling?

18:12.656 --> 18:15.529
Oh, thank you,
Commander Chase.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.531
Feel a lot better
if we knew where Joel went.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.533
Found his car in Laie.

18:19.576 --> 18:22.797
Dumped. He's in the wind.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.015
Where's Jesse?

18:24.059 --> 18:26.366
Checking in

18:26.409 --> 18:28.585
on the team like
a good acting SAC.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.674
But he's not gonna
be happy when

18:30.718 --> 18:32.807
you tell him that we got
our heads scrambled for nothing.

18:32.850 --> 18:35.201
For something, actually.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.464
Is that Meg Carter?

18:37.507 --> 18:38.682
Yeah. Our victim

18:38.726 --> 18:40.510
Bryan Shepherd's girlfriend.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.166
What did your children call Ms. Shaw?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.733
Aunt Maggie.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.996
Did she babysit
- them for you?
- Yes.

18:48.039 --> 18:50.390
In your house
- here on the island?
- Yes.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.392
Did she take them
- on any outings?
- Yes.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.568
Do you know if Ms. Shaw ever asked your children

18:54.611 --> 18:55.873
to keep anything
secret from you?

18:55.917 --> 18:57.310
I don't know.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.572
Did you
ever catch Ms. Shaw

18:58.615 --> 18:59.921
- looking through your desk?
- No.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.228
Computer?
- No.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.622
Throughout this questioning,
Agent Tennant,

19:05.666 --> 19:08.103
you have continued to describe
Ms. Shaw as a friend,

19:08.147 --> 19:10.497
almost as family,

19:10.540 --> 19:14.153
and, in that context,
I feel compelled to ask.

19:14.196 --> 19:18.026
Despite never catching her
engaged in suspect activity,

19:18.069 --> 19:20.507
is it possible that
Ms. Shaw maintained

19:20.550 --> 19:23.771
her relationship with you
so that she could gain access

19:23.814 --> 19:26.252
to sensitive
cases and operations

19:26.295 --> 19:28.079
in the Pacific region?

19:30.691 --> 19:32.171
Agent Tennant.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.911
Is it possible
that Ms. Shaw...?

19:33.955 --> 19:36.218
Yes.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.220
It's possible.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.707
Why are you showing me this?

19:46.750 --> 19:48.709
'Cause I need to know
how you know him.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.191
His name's
Joel Johnson.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.630
We were in a relationship
a while ago.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.023
Are you still
in contact with him?

19:59.067 --> 20:00.024
No.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.288
Why?

20:02.331 --> 20:05.334
Because your ex attacked Bryan,

20:05.378 --> 20:07.554
the MARSOC team,
and my teammates.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.120
Joel?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.255
We found that photo
where he was staying.

20:14.822 --> 20:17.172
Tell me about
your relationship.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.566
Uh, we were engaged.

20:19.609 --> 20:20.610
What happened?

20:20.654 --> 20:23.613
He wasn't the one.

20:26.529 --> 20:29.663
He has now attacked
a dozen people.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.752
I need a little more
than "he wasn't the one."

20:31.795 --> 20:34.276
I-I don't know.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.584
He was smart and-and curious.

20:37.627 --> 20:41.283
But, over time, he got
possessive and angry.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.285
And it made me uncomfortable,

20:43.329 --> 20:45.679
but I can't imagine
he's capable of this.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.246
Have you heard
from him?

20:47.289 --> 20:50.292
Not for five months.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.554
We both moved on.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.950
I would say he hasn't moved on.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.914
Pretty cool look.

21:03.958 --> 21:07.657
Bit of a headache.
Cubano from E.A.R.L.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.051
Cure for hunger and, uh,

21:10.094 --> 21:11.966
intelligence inquiries.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.621
I don't know how much
of an appetite I have,

21:14.664 --> 21:16.840
but thank you.

21:16.884 --> 21:20.322
Why don't you tell me
about the case?

21:20.366 --> 21:22.411
A few of us
got zapped

21:22.455 --> 21:25.196
by the same wave machine
that got our Marines,

21:25.240 --> 21:27.416
but... Commander Chase

21:27.460 --> 21:30.419
sang some weird voodoo
song, and we're fine.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.900
You sure you're okay?
Yes.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.772
And I'm not just saying that
'cause you're having a crap day.

21:37.557 --> 21:38.993
Well, please tell me
we accomplished more

21:39.036 --> 21:40.603
than just putting you
in harm's way.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.562
We got a bead on a suspect,

21:42.605 --> 21:45.913
a contractor working on
a secret DARPA project, but

21:45.956 --> 21:48.872
we're wading through corporate
bureaucracy trying to get access

21:48.916 --> 21:51.092
- to termination records.
- Which contractor?

21:51.135 --> 21:52.746
Douglas-Neptune.

21:52.789 --> 21:54.617
Give me your phone.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.010
An old colleague

21:56.053 --> 21:57.577
I went to FLETC with,

21:57.620 --> 21:59.361
he went over
to the dark side, but...

21:59.405 --> 22:01.885
he should help you
cut through the red tape.

22:04.627 --> 22:07.064
You know how valuable
you are, right?

22:07.108 --> 22:09.763
- It's just a phone number.
- No, it's not just that. I mean,

22:09.806 --> 22:12.156
you make everyone
around you better.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.857
So, please, eat the sandwich.
Don't want you being hangry

22:16.900 --> 22:19.555
in the middle
of something like this.

22:19.599 --> 22:23.080
I don't know how I'm gonna
get over what happened.

22:26.301 --> 22:29.173
But you'll move forward.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.610
That's all anyone can do.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.525
And...

22:32.568 --> 22:35.528
you don't have to do it alone.

22:41.577 --> 22:42.578
Oh.

22:42.622 --> 22:46.016
Oh, Special Agent Whistler.

22:49.019 --> 22:51.152
Well, congratulations.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.632
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

22:52.675 --> 22:55.330
So, are you...

22:55.374 --> 22:57.593
excited about the new job?

22:57.637 --> 23:01.075
Uh, the...
the building's really nice.

23:01.118 --> 23:04.165
Like... "borderline abuse
of taxpayer dollars" nice.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.602
Publicly accusing
your new agency

23:06.646 --> 23:08.604
of boondoggle before
you even start. Bold.

23:14.871 --> 23:16.917
Well, I, uh...

23:16.960 --> 23:19.920
I have to go follow up
on some leads, so...

23:19.963 --> 23:21.356
Well, you know,
if it was only

23:21.400 --> 23:23.576
a couple days later,
I'd be able to help.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.447
I'm gonna have "creds"
and everything.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.667
I hear "creds"
is what all the...

23:27.710 --> 23:30.147
the cool agents say.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.150
What are you doing?

23:33.194 --> 23:35.326
I just... you know, I feel like

23:35.370 --> 23:37.633
things are... unresolved.

23:37.677 --> 23:40.027
No, no, we're good.

23:40.070 --> 23:43.030
- It doesn't feel good.
- We are so good.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.337
But, yeah,
like I said, I, uh,

23:46.381 --> 23:48.209
have a case to follow up on.

23:48.252 --> 23:51.081
So, congrats again, and...

23:51.125 --> 23:53.170
Yeah.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.476
L-Lucy.

24:01.918 --> 24:05.313
Hey, Tennant's lead
came through for us, so...

24:07.968 --> 24:10.536
You okay?
Yeah.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.494
Yeah, I, uh, just, uh,

24:12.538 --> 24:14.757
ran into someone.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.237
I don't need to talk about it.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.891
We can catch you up
to speed later.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.849
No, no, no, no.
Let's-let's keep going.

24:19.893 --> 24:22.199
All right, um,

24:22.243 --> 24:24.288
we got all the addresses

24:24.332 --> 24:26.290
Joel Johnson ever gave
to his former employer.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.684
HPD's sitting
on all of them.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.294
Got access to all
his bank accounts.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.687
Tracking expenses,
though, it looks like

24:31.731 --> 24:33.776
he ditched
the plastic, and

24:33.820 --> 24:37.519
we also got a copy
of his exit interview.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.348
First they take me
off the project,

24:40.391 --> 24:43.090
and now you're letting me go?

24:43.133 --> 24:44.700
I'm the best engineer
you've got.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.963
There-There's nothing that
I can't build to last.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.965
Except his relationship.

24:49.009 --> 24:52.273
Some of your choices make
your coworkers uncomfortable,

24:52.316 --> 24:54.710
and unfortunately
you've taken no steps

24:54.754 --> 24:56.886
to address those behaviors.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.587
I'm gonna sue all of you.

25:02.892 --> 25:04.894
There's a bit more.

25:04.938 --> 25:08.376
It's mostly just a "greatest
hits" of male fragility.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.639
Personnel records show

25:10.683 --> 25:12.641
a decline
in performance reviews

25:12.685 --> 25:15.644
and an increasing number
of complaints

25:15.688 --> 25:18.255
from coworkers in the months
leading up to his termination,

25:18.299 --> 25:20.388
escalating significantly
about the time

25:20.431 --> 25:22.216
Meg returned from deployment.

25:22.259 --> 25:25.436
The unit's been back from
that assignment for over month.

25:25.480 --> 25:26.916
Why attack now?

25:26.960 --> 25:30.006
He kept the picture for months.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.356
Maybe he thought she was
coming back to him,

25:32.400 --> 25:34.576
and then at some point
he saw her with Shepherd.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.099
That tracks.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.580
Around the same time,
his spending, travel,

25:38.624 --> 25:40.800
his entire pattern
of life changed.

25:40.843 --> 25:44.455
So, he saw her with another man,
and that broke him?

25:44.499 --> 25:46.632
Well, makes sense to me.

25:46.675 --> 25:49.069
And, what, he started
stalking her?

25:49.112 --> 25:51.550
Well, the dude built a weapon
to kill her boyfriend.

25:51.593 --> 25:54.465
I mean, stalking seems
well within the possibilities.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.685
The man clearly doesn't
take rejection well.

25:56.729 --> 25:59.340
Rejection will make you do
a lot of things.

26:03.344 --> 26:04.954
I'll keep digging.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.093
Are we done for the day?

26:13.136 --> 26:16.009
We're done, done.

26:16.052 --> 26:18.751
We'll let you know our findings
as soon as they're available.

26:18.794 --> 26:19.926
Mr. Smith?

26:19.969 --> 26:21.754
Yes?

26:21.797 --> 26:24.844
You didn't let me
read my statement.

26:24.887 --> 26:27.063
But the crux of it is this--

26:27.107 --> 26:29.065
Maggie Shaw mentored me,

26:29.109 --> 26:31.807
molded me, and took care of me.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.505
But she also taught me
a valuable lesson--

26:34.549 --> 26:37.508
always assume
someone is watching.

26:37.552 --> 26:40.511
Did she tell you
it would be her?

26:40.555 --> 26:42.644
No.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.299
But it was still a lesson
I took to heart every day

26:45.342 --> 26:46.909
as I did my job

26:46.953 --> 26:48.998
and lived my life.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.870
Is there anything else?

26:50.913 --> 26:53.046
No.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.569
Okay.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.673
Is it over?

27:11.717 --> 27:13.414
The interviews,
at least.

27:13.457 --> 27:14.676
How are you?

27:16.809 --> 27:18.941
Needing something
to take my mind off of it.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.682
Our victim
Bryan Shepherd

27:20.726 --> 27:22.466
should be taken out
of the coma soon.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.164
- HPD's on him.
- Yeah.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.209
We have a protective
detail for his girlfriend

27:26.253 --> 27:27.950
Meg Carter as well.

27:27.994 --> 27:30.083
Okay, what about our suspect?
Dumped his cell phone

27:30.126 --> 27:32.389
after our first raid.
Still off the grid.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.608
Not anymore.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.350
You're back.
Hi, Ernie.

27:36.393 --> 27:39.962
- Should I keep going?
- Yes. Please.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.486
I have been trying
to find any way

27:42.530 --> 27:44.010
to track Joel
since he went dark.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.620
He's had to have used something

27:45.664 --> 27:47.230
in order to stay ahead of us
without detection.

27:47.274 --> 27:48.623
A tablet or something?

27:48.667 --> 27:49.929
A gaming device.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.366
- Oh, like a Game Boy?
- What's that?

27:52.409 --> 27:54.890
It's something Jesse saw
when he went through a wormhole.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.544
No, not a Game Boy.

27:56.587 --> 27:59.416
You jailbreak handheld
gaming devices these days.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.896
You have a computer in your hand

28:00.940 --> 28:02.158
without all the same
attention drawn to it.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.725
It's likely how
he's been able

28:03.769 --> 28:05.379
to stay ahead of us
without detection, but...

28:05.422 --> 28:06.467
You found it.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.947
Once I knew what the device was,

28:07.990 --> 28:09.470
I knew how to find it,

28:09.513 --> 28:12.038
and it's in San Diego,
Joel's hometown.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.605
I sent a lead over
to the Southwest field office.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.520
Okay, but what do we do now?

28:16.564 --> 28:18.609
Wait.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.437
No other choice.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.718
I researched
everything about you,

28:39.761 --> 28:41.894
and I am happy to report
this is exactly

28:41.937 --> 28:43.634
what I thought your office
would look like.

28:43.678 --> 28:47.377
I'm not sure if that's
a good thing or a bad thing.

28:47.421 --> 28:48.857
Just a thing.

28:50.424 --> 28:53.035
- Do you want to sit down?
- Uh, no.

28:53.079 --> 28:56.038
I've conducted
hundreds of inquiries

28:56.082 --> 28:58.084
and security investigations,

28:58.127 --> 29:00.826
and there's one lie
that almost everyone tells.

29:02.044 --> 29:04.568
That they weren't vulnerable
to a breach.

29:04.612 --> 29:07.571
Well, we all want
to think that, don't we?

29:07.615 --> 29:09.486
I guess so.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.011
But you told us that Ms. Shaw
was basically family.

29:12.054 --> 29:13.708
Now, if you'd gone on to say

29:13.752 --> 29:15.971
she couldn't possibly
have taken advantage of you,

29:16.015 --> 29:18.669
I wouldn't have believed
anything else you said.

29:20.062 --> 29:21.803
Which means?

29:21.847 --> 29:24.414
We conducted
an exhaustive search

29:24.458 --> 29:26.503
before your inquiry,
and we found no evidence

29:26.547 --> 29:29.419
that Ms. Shaw took advantage
of her relationship with you.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.077
Would've been nice to hear that
in the beginning.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.777
Is that how you would have
conducted the questioning?

29:40.604 --> 29:41.910
No.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.520
Now, we cannot determine whether

29:43.564 --> 29:45.218
she chose not to take
advantage of you

29:45.261 --> 29:46.697
or you didn't let her,

29:46.741 --> 29:48.221
but either way,
the result is the same.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.614
You are cleared
of any wrongdoing,

29:50.658 --> 29:52.442
and you can keep
your security clearance.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.618
Have a nice day,
Special Agent

29:54.662 --> 29:56.795
in Charge Tennant.

30:15.204 --> 30:18.077
All right,
what do we have?

30:19.252 --> 30:20.906
I don't know what
you're so happy about.

30:20.949 --> 30:22.124
You just got demoted.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.517
Ah, whatever.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.345
I'm good with it.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.129
Heard from Southwest.

30:27.173 --> 30:29.871
Their agents got a hit
on Joel's location.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.525
Mm... That's...

30:31.568 --> 30:33.222
not Joel.

30:33.266 --> 30:36.095
Mm-hmm. He stashed the device
in someone else's bag.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.879
He set an automatic
"power on" function,

30:37.923 --> 30:40.403
so it wouldn't ping again
until it was long gone.

30:40.447 --> 30:41.883
A diversion.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.842
Which means Joel's probably
still on the island.

30:43.885 --> 30:44.930
Any idea where?

30:44.973 --> 30:46.235
Probably the house Meg and Joel

30:46.279 --> 30:47.497
bought while engaged.

30:47.541 --> 30:50.413
It's on the market
and unoccupied, and

30:50.457 --> 30:52.502
except, according
to Honolulu Electric,

30:52.546 --> 30:54.417
the power usage
has seen a spike.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.419
We just now
heard about this?

30:56.463 --> 30:58.247
He had bad credit,

30:58.291 --> 30:59.945
so she's the only one
on the deed and mortgage.

30:59.988 --> 31:02.034
It's okay, Ernie.
Do we have an address?

31:02.077 --> 31:04.906
In Wai'alae Iki.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.386
All right,
let's go get him.

31:06.429 --> 31:07.822
Wait.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.524
Ear plugs?

31:14.568 --> 31:17.571
They're ear-wigs with
tapered chains of beads

31:17.614 --> 31:19.268
made from
tungsten carbide

31:19.312 --> 31:21.140
alternating
with beads created

31:21.183 --> 31:23.185
from a plastic
called Delrin.

31:23.229 --> 31:24.534
So, high-tech ear plugs.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.755
Uh, one more thing.

31:27.798 --> 31:30.236
There's no telling what else
Joel has in store.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.195
What are you saying?

31:34.718 --> 31:36.372
I'm coming with you.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.770
See you got
yourself a vest.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.337
Well, the bank was
an unfortunate lesson

31:44.380 --> 31:45.904
in preparedness.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.818
Which is a lesson
you really took to heart.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.690
What is all
that stuff?

31:49.733 --> 31:51.300
Kevlar's for bullets.

31:51.344 --> 31:54.651
These are for whatever else
Joel has for us.

31:54.695 --> 31:57.698
Like now. The sensors are
picking up ultrasonic waves.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.439
How's everybody's
heads?

31:59.482 --> 32:01.006
Yeah, high-tech ear plugs
for the win.

32:01.049 --> 32:02.616
He knows we're here.

32:02.659 --> 32:03.878
All right, Ernie,
you and Jesse take the back.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.358
Kai, Lucy, come with me
to the front.

32:05.401 --> 32:07.186
Everyone make sure
the entrances are clean.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.723
Front entrance is boobytrapped.

32:22.766 --> 32:25.552
Back door's open.
He might already be gone.

32:25.595 --> 32:27.771
Ultrasonic waves
are still registering high.

32:27.815 --> 32:29.643
He's got to be inside. Unless

32:29.686 --> 32:31.384
he's set up the device
with a remote of some kind.

32:31.427 --> 32:33.952
- Stay out here.
- Usually, I'd say yes,

32:33.995 --> 32:35.866
but I think you're safer
if I'm with you,

32:35.910 --> 32:37.956
which you should not
take as anything

32:37.999 --> 32:39.783
other than a sign
of professional respect.

32:39.827 --> 32:42.308
Got it.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.059
Get out!

33:04.025 --> 33:05.766
You okay, Ernie?

33:09.117 --> 33:10.945
I'm alive,

33:10.989 --> 33:13.034
but not so much okay.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.905
We're coming for you.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.298
Don't.

33:16.342 --> 33:19.127
There's no telling
where his traps are.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.564
He's gone full-on
psycho <i>Home Alone.</i>

33:21.608 --> 33:23.479
If I can find a hub, though,

33:23.523 --> 33:26.830
I may be able to disable
the sensors.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.448
Oh, hi, Joel.

33:43.543 --> 33:45.936
All right, we need to
find a way to help Ernie.

33:45.980 --> 33:48.026
When I was in Lashkargah, we
came across a house-borne IED.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.549
Only way into the place
was underneath.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.420
If I get some charges,
I can get us in.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.466
Ernie, we think
we can get to you,

33:53.509 --> 33:55.642
but you're gonna
need to distract him.

33:55.685 --> 33:57.296
How many more are there?

33:57.339 --> 34:00.255
It's just me and the other guy
who was here to help me.

34:00.299 --> 34:03.215
Though I'm pretty sure he's
calling for backup right now.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.787
You don't look
like an agent.

34:10.831 --> 34:13.181
I'm not.
I'm-I'm-I'm someone...

34:13.225 --> 34:14.530
someone like you.

34:14.574 --> 34:16.837
- Right.
- No, no, really.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.013
Like, I appreciate
the sophistication

34:19.057 --> 34:20.493
of your centrally controlled,

34:20.536 --> 34:23.235
individually actionable
explosive devices.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.716
A-And I also know
what it's like to be rejected.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.414
I wasn't rejected.

34:28.457 --> 34:31.112
That's what
I told myself, too.

34:31.808 --> 34:34.550
Okay, okay, okay.
I-I was married.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.597
And she was perfect.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.120
The kind of perfect

34:39.164 --> 34:40.339
where you let
all the little annoyances slide.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.036
Was Ernie
really married?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.560
- All right, I need a hand.
- I'll go.

34:44.604 --> 34:46.301
Size advantage for once.

34:46.345 --> 34:47.781
All right, Jesse and I
will cover out here.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.087
The one problem, though?

34:49.130 --> 34:50.566
I wasn't perfect for her.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.526
That's not the case with Meg.

34:53.569 --> 34:55.093
Other things got in the way.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.225
We can't ask people
to choose between us

34:57.269 --> 34:59.140
and the other things
they care about.

34:59.184 --> 35:02.926
She only thinks
she loves that Marine.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.537
Hey.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.453
Put this on the floorboard
just above this pipe.

35:07.496 --> 35:09.281
This is your
pain, and it's not for me

35:09.324 --> 35:10.934
to tell you
how to process it, but

35:10.978 --> 35:14.112
do you know what I learned
since I got divorced?

35:14.155 --> 35:17.550
You-you can't make someone
love you, but...

35:20.988 --> 35:23.382
Love is an echo.

35:23.425 --> 35:26.515
You put it out in the world, and
eventually it comes back to you.

35:26.559 --> 35:29.605
Maybe just not from
where you expected.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.955
What if we set off
other traps?

35:31.999 --> 35:33.870
No, he wouldn't put a trap
in the middle of the room.

35:33.914 --> 35:36.177
How sure are you?

35:36.221 --> 35:39.267
Sure enough, given that we
don't have other alternatives.

35:40.660 --> 35:41.922
Okay.

35:43.184 --> 35:44.316
Ernie,

35:44.359 --> 35:46.231
get close to a wall.

35:50.496 --> 35:53.977
So, y-you think that
I should move on?

35:54.021 --> 35:55.196
I did.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.067
And-and now I'm with

35:57.111 --> 35:58.199
someone better.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.201
What if I don't want to?

36:00.245 --> 36:02.203
Is this really how
you see yourself?

36:02.247 --> 36:05.554
I mean, boobytrapping houses
and zapping people with...

36:05.598 --> 36:09.341
state of the art,
very impressive weaponry?

36:21.918 --> 36:23.920
- What are you doing?
- You're right.

36:23.964 --> 36:27.054
I lost her.

36:27.097 --> 36:29.796
So what's the point?

36:29.839 --> 36:31.928
I really think you're missing
the message here, Joel.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.068
It's disarmed!

36:42.852 --> 36:44.854
NCIS!
Get your hands Up!

36:51.078 --> 36:53.298
Did you punch him in the nose?

36:53.341 --> 36:54.516
A little.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.701
I'm sure that didn't get old.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.529
Oh.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.705
Yeah, Jesse and I, we have a...

37:09.749 --> 37:11.881
thing.

37:11.925 --> 37:15.537
A thing where you buy
him novelty gifts as a joke.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.670
Yeah.

37:17.713 --> 37:20.760
You know, it sounds a little
weird when you say it like that.

37:20.803 --> 37:23.066
Hmm.

37:23.110 --> 37:25.373
Lucy was just here.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.984
She bolt when she saw me coming?

37:28.028 --> 37:30.813
It's not for me to say.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.772
Yeah, fair enough.

37:32.815 --> 37:35.165
I-I was actually
looking for Tennant.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.777
She just left
for the day, so...

37:39.605 --> 37:41.955
- Anything else you need?
- Oh, no.

37:41.998 --> 37:44.305
Okay.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.873
Good night.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.325
Oof. You okay?

38:04.369 --> 38:06.109
No.

38:06.153 --> 38:08.503
Remind me to never
punch anything, ever.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.418
Sure, yeah.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.420
Don't do that.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.380
You need something?

38:15.423 --> 38:18.470
Uh, well,
there's-there's something

38:18.513 --> 38:21.168
in the bullpen I wanted
to get away from.

38:21.211 --> 38:23.213
Is it six feet tall in heels?

38:23.257 --> 38:26.304
- Do you want me to leave?
- No, it's fine.

38:28.393 --> 38:31.309
- Here. Let me help.
- Thank you.

38:34.442 --> 38:37.271
Okay.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.707
So...

38:40.405 --> 38:42.624
Is it true

38:42.668 --> 38:44.452
that you were married before?

38:44.496 --> 38:47.194
Yes.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.675
And that you divorced

38:49.718 --> 38:52.591
and found love again
with Detective Reed?

38:52.634 --> 38:55.376
First part's right.

38:57.073 --> 38:59.685
Mm.

38:59.728 --> 39:02.601
What about all that stuff
you were saying about...

39:02.644 --> 39:04.646
love being an echo?

39:04.690 --> 39:07.214
I was trying to not die.

39:09.259 --> 39:11.610
Truth is, Lucy,

39:11.653 --> 39:14.526
love is pain.

39:14.569 --> 39:17.529

oxytocin trick our brains
