01:07.776 --> 01:10.314
From birth,
we hit the ground running.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.944
Put one foot in front of the other
and anything's possible.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.941
That's all bullshit. The truth is
from evolution to revolution,

01:18.078 --> 01:20.569
things hardly ever change gradually.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.947
They change suddenly in great leaps.

01:23.083 --> 01:28.421
For those who understand this, life is
a constant search for the next big jump.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.998
For the rest of us, all that jumping
seems kinda stupid.

01:32.133 --> 01:35.419
Are you mad at me?

01:35.553 --> 01:39.088
- Beside myself.
- Give it to me. Both barrels.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.549
You don't mess with fate, peanut.

01:41.685 --> 01:45.385
There's no discussions.
Life's done, it's done.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.104
- I know that.
- You of all people should know that.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.440
I have to go to work.

01:51.569 --> 01:55.650
- Wanna talk?
- I don't wanna talk.

01:58.410 --> 02:02.158
- Have some French fries.
- They're cold. I gotta go.

02:05.792 --> 02:10.869
That's when it
occurred to me. I really didn't have any friends.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.461
I just had co-workers.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.667
And I really wanted a friend.

02:18.596 --> 02:22.215
As a young undead woman
out on my own in the world,

02:22.350 --> 02:24.509
where would I find that friend?

02:25.687 --> 02:28.807
Maybe at my day job.
Maybe at Happy Time.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.985
Maybe Delores wasn't just my co-worker.
Maybe she could be my friend.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.278
Hi! How's the little engine that could?

02:36.406 --> 02:37.817
Or not.

02:37.949 --> 02:41.116
- I'm almost finished.
- Wonderful.

02:41.244 --> 02:44.578
The embossed binders
are in a white box by my desk.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.742
We'll do the cover page last.
Gayle's making changes.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.079
- Did you know she's colour-blind?
- No.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.750
- That's unusual for girls.
- Really?

02:53.882 --> 02:58.923
Sure. My sister's colour-blind.
Everyone made such a fuss because it's so rare.

02:59.054 --> 03:04.261
But she's a little masculine so we weren't
surprised. Has a wispy little moustache.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.266
She sounds pretty.

03:06.394 --> 03:10.522
Do you have a sister, Millie?

03:11.274 --> 03:15.687
I know George has a sister.
Had a sister. But does Millie?

03:15.820 --> 03:19.485
- I didn't mean to stump you.
- I pulled something outta my ass.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.367
I have an older brother.
His name is Luke.

03:22.494 --> 03:26.741
He's a jet pilot.
He bombed the crap out of Baghdad.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.456
- A jet pilot?
- And in that instant I invented Millie.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.337
- I had no idea.
- Neither did I.

03:33.463 --> 03:38.458
OK, back to work. We'll have to save this
for a latte one of these mornings.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.945
Millie. Have you ever kept a scrapbook?

03:59.823 --> 04:01.198
Uh...

04:02.158 --> 04:04.234
No.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.168
- You all know Millie?
- Hi, Millie.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.121
- Hi, Millie.
- Hi.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.458
She's getting her feet wet
with the whole Excel system.

04:18.591 --> 04:23.004
- We all know how that can be.
- Are you going on the Excel retreat?

04:23.138 --> 04:26.756
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
Am I going?

04:26.891 --> 04:31.719
No. We've had a bad experience
with one of the tutorial staff.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.428
What was her name? Diane something?

04:34.566 --> 04:38.148
- Farber... Farmer. Wilson!
- I've blocked it out.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.148
She was a big C U Next Tuesday.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.108
Gayle.

04:43.241 --> 04:47.369
I think she was
just in an unhappy place.

04:47.495 --> 04:53.035
Anyway, so welcome
to our little scrapbook circle.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.837
The lengths I go to for free food.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.296
You wanna make sure
and use acid-free stickers,

04:59.424 --> 05:02.710
especially on your friendship pages.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.884
That's good to know.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.930
This is my work-related scrapbook.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.185
My first pay stub.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.561
And the sparkling cider label
from Harry V's cake lunch.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.486
This is my work-related scrapbook.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.740
These are bone fragments I found

05:30.872 --> 05:33.992
next to an exploded
high-voltage transformer.

05:34.125 --> 05:38.538
And this is from
that nuclear-reactor incident.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.878
I think it's a testicle.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.876
I recommend not skimping
on border paper.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.014
Will you start a scrapbook?

05:51.142 --> 05:56.385
I could have tried to see the thrill in
cataloguing artefacts and laminating memories,

05:56.523 --> 05:59.477
but that wouldn't be me.

05:59.609 --> 06:04.948
I would, but I'm having
one of those heavy-flow days.

06:09.911 --> 06:13.612
- Red is my favourite.
- Could Betty be a friend?

06:13.748 --> 06:16.583
You're talking about the wax,
not the cheese?

06:16.710 --> 06:19.283
Half the fun is taking the wax
off the cheese.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.505
It's kind of like
taking off a man's clothes.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.217
- I wouldn't know.
- Oh, so much fun.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.301
You're beautiful. You do know that?

06:30.432 --> 06:33.219
- Definitely a friend.
- It's true.

06:33.351 --> 06:36.637
OK. I like your ring.

06:36.771 --> 06:41.184
I saw it in the village in 19277.
My boy bought it for me.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.983
Wow. No guy's ever bought me anything.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.399
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Are you prostitutes?

06:48.533 --> 06:51.320
- No.
- Then why are you talking to me?

06:51.453 --> 06:55.616
You've got a worldly quality,
a certainje ne sais quoi.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.204
- Say what?
- You're Chuck, right?

07:00.170 --> 07:03.171
- What kind of car do you drive?
- Convertible.

07:03.298 --> 07:06.418
We used to call them breezers.
Isn't that cute?

07:07.302 --> 07:09.544
- Is it a red convertible?
- Yeah.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.431
I thought you might.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.558
I don't get it. Who are you?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.761
Somehow he'd convinced himself

07:18.897 --> 07:22.396
we were a pair of black widows
out to mate and kill.

07:22.525 --> 07:28.361
He should have been worrying about
the nest of poisonous spiders in his closet.

07:28.490 --> 07:33.732
- I forgot to tell you. I found out who Millie is.
- Oh, yeah?

07:33.870 --> 07:36.705
Hello? How come
I can't get a glass of water?

07:36.831 --> 07:41.078
- Because you're history.
- Millie has an older brother, Luke.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.165
- He's a jet pilot. He's cool.
- Are you close?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.835
Yeah. At least, I think I am.

07:46.966 --> 07:50.798
- Does he drive a breezer?
- Absolutely. He's a jet pilot.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.550
- He loves speed.
- Mmm, sounds hot.

07:53.682 --> 07:57.679
- What car does Millie drive?
- She doesn't have a car. She hitches.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.930
Looks like someone
fell over in the street.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.267
Honey, that's you.

08:04.401 --> 08:08.019
Betty got excited
about the littlest things.

08:08.154 --> 08:12.366
Being undead made her more alive
than any living person I know.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.446
But nothing surprised her.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.621
- How's the water?
- Chilly. It woke me right up.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.843
He's not interested in taking the leap.

08:31.970 --> 08:36.881
Terrible when a man's lily-livered, isn't it?
So unattractive.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.302
- That's a little high.
- Bigger splash from up there.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.309
Is that a fact?

08:42.438 --> 08:46.935
Aren't you a friend of the frotteurist
at the picnic rubbing himself on people?

08:47.068 --> 08:50.686
- I met him at the dessert table.
- I didn't see a dessert table.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.278
Then get your peepers checked.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.026
He cupped my buttocks
reaching for the blueberry buckle.

08:57.162 --> 09:01.409
- Probably figured that I didn't notice.
- He calls that soul popping.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.293
I think you should keep better company.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.171
- I apologise on his behalf.
- That's sweet.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.381
But he should take responsibility
for his actions.

09:10.508 --> 09:14.173
- Couldn't agree more.
- Then I expect a formal apology.

09:14.304 --> 09:18.348
- March your friend down here.
- He's already gone.

09:18.475 --> 09:22.307
- Where'd he go?
- Got a promotion, I guess. He's gone.

09:22.437 --> 09:27.015
If it's any comfort at all,
yours was the last tush he'll grab.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.902
- Where are you headed?
- I'm going again.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.361
- You like falling?
- Not the falling. It's the jumping.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.111
It'd be better
if it weren't for the falling.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.777
Falling's easy. You just fall.
Jumping requires strength of will.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.320
- Not on a plank.
- That isn't your choice.

09:42.457 --> 09:45.493
If it is, it's the best feeling in the world.

09:45.627 --> 09:49.956
- And you don't care where you land?
- Like falling, you just land.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.545
- You're a force of nature.
- Try jumping.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.593
It's the greatest feeling in the world.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.131
Oh, no.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.388
She's wearing my bathing suit.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.435
And that's how Betty learned

10:04.562 --> 10:08.477
sometimes jumping
is your last feeling in the world.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.432
I miss Chuck.

10:10.568 --> 10:14.981
Why do you take people's Polaroids
right before you pop their souls?

10:15.740 --> 10:21.114
I was looking for a signature,
to get away from the cloak and sickle thing.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.819
I've got a sack of convertible people.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.709
- A whole sack?
- I've got lots of sacks.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.207
- Helps me keep track.
- Really?

10:29.337 --> 10:31.828
Everyone in their place.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.963
- What sack are you in?
- I'm a jumper. No sack can hold me.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.462
OK. Happy thoughts.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.433
My face gets sore if I smile too much.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.765
Do it anyway.

10:46.396 --> 10:50.974
Maybe Betty was right.
Maybe there is a place for everything.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.600
Maybe everything is in its place.

10:55.321 --> 10:59.615
But what if you've seen all the places
and everything's already in its place

10:59.743 --> 11:01.700
and you still can't sit still?

11:01.828 --> 11:05.992
This one is for the little, hard,
reusable ones that look like a nipple.

11:06.124 --> 11:10.833
This one frequency-wipes those
electronic jobbies inside the packages.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.789
- Going shopping?
- She is.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.627
Do you want me
to pick you up a V-neck?

11:15.759 --> 11:19.128
I'm OK. But you see something
that screams me, pick it up.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.098
- Heard about the big dust cloud?
- What dust cloud?

11:23.224 --> 11:25.632
Five miles wide, two miles high.

11:25.769 --> 11:29.102
Boating over China,
wiping out everything in its path.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.935
The dust is so thick it's blocking out the sun,

11:32.067 --> 11:35.436
taking paint off of cars
and flesh off of cows.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.281
Flesh off cows.

11:43.536 --> 11:47.830
Thousands of little yellow people
keeling over in the streets.

11:47.957 --> 11:51.825
- Little yellow people?
- You been talking to Gary?

11:51.961 --> 11:53.420
Yeah.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.120
What'd I tell you about talking to Gary?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.713
- He's full of shit.
- No dust cloud.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.919
No dead yellow people.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.514
Maybe not.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.720
Too bad. Trip to the Orient would've been nice.
I love dim sum.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.019
I've been to Bali.
Three volcanoes, one typhoon.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.730
Incredible devastation.
Beautiful black-sand beaches.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.944
Do I ever get to go anywhere?

12:18.071 --> 12:21.855
I'll take you to Pamplona.
Work those early-morning bull runs.

12:21.991 --> 12:25.158
I could do that,
except do they have late-morning

12:25.286 --> 12:27.860
or early-afternoon bull runs?

12:27.997 --> 12:30.535
We usually take the soul in the AM.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.240
Rest of the day is sangria and sunshine.

12:33.378 --> 12:37.126
The dead are very laid-back in Spain.
It's a nice gig.

12:37.257 --> 12:42.382
Do we ever take non-working vacations,
you know, where no one dies?

12:44.139 --> 12:47.009
- Everyone throw in. Except you.
- He ate my fruit.

12:47.142 --> 12:50.345
Not just the cantaloupe.
The strawberries too.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.930
Well, you did.
Actually, about a dollar's worth.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.022
You want me to give you a dollar?

12:57.152 --> 13:01.066
That's why I said
you ate a whole dollar's worth.

13:07.662 --> 13:12.039
Rube, how am I meant to get
all the way out to East Bumblefuck?

13:13.293 --> 13:16.744
- You got a bus pass.
- You could tell me the right line.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.837
Get a schedule.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.290
I could use a ride home.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.917
You got two good legs, peanut. Use 'em.

13:24.054 --> 13:28.762
I'll take you. She's just a kid.
Do you have to be such an asshole?

13:28.892 --> 13:30.968
Come on.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.940
Hm?

13:39.069 --> 13:41.441
No, never heard of it. I'm sorry.

13:41.571 --> 13:46.862
Recorded in '33. Or '34. I can't recall.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.068
Practically a national anthem.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.031
No more tea for you.

13:53.792 --> 13:57.243
- Why'd you pour me a cup?
- I didn't. I poured me a cup.

13:57.379 --> 14:01.127
- Where's your sugar?
- Sugar's in the sugar bowl.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.470
That's my cup.
I'm the only one drinks out of that cup.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.096
Rinse it out
and put it back where you found it.

14:11.226 --> 14:14.013
It's not like you can use it any more.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.850
I got other cups for guests.

14:22.070 --> 14:28.108
I also sang with Les Brown
and his Band of Renown.

14:29.244 --> 14:33.621
You can have that cup. I hate that cat.

14:33.748 --> 14:38.161
If I had a cat like that,
I'd sell it to a Vietnamese restaurant.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.832
- You know Les Brown?
- No.

14:40.964 --> 14:45.425
Les told me I could do
anything on that stage

14:45.552 --> 14:47.794
as long as I was singing.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.420
Such a kind heart.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.344
Except when he was working
with Red Nichols.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.014
But Red could be a real cocksucker,

14:56.146 --> 15:00.642
especially when he was parading around
with his ass in the air

15:00.775 --> 15:02.851
like a baboon presenting.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.358
I never had time for him.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.944
Are these valuable?

15:08.074 --> 15:11.574
- I painted those.
- Pity.

15:11.703 --> 15:15.368
I buried three dogs in those woods.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.618
Coyotes dug up the first two.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.330
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.936
How do you know who goes where?

15:37.062 --> 15:41.724
I look at the picture and then
a light bulb goes off in my stomach.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.610
- Gut reaction?
- Bingo.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.488
Do you know what people
are in what sack?

15:47.614 --> 15:52.323
- Of course I do. I put them there.
- God, you're like my mother.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.694
- Millie's or yours?
- Mine.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.074
Ooh.

15:56.206 --> 16:00.250
But Millie has a brother.
A race-car driver, a jet pilot.

16:00.377 --> 16:04.920
- He is. He almost won the Indy 500.
- Ooh.

16:05.048 --> 16:08.962
- Do you have any brothers or sisters?
- Mm-mm. Just cousins.

16:09.094 --> 16:13.008
What about your other identities
or whatever you call it?

16:13.139 --> 16:15.465
Like Theresa?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.676
Theresa and Sandy.

16:17.811 --> 16:22.354
All my alter egos were only children.
It's just easier to remember that way.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.566
- You were a Sandy?
- I loved being Sandy.

16:25.694 --> 16:29.228
- She was a pistol.
- How many girls have you been?

16:29.364 --> 16:33.860
Three. No, four.
Maxine, Candice, Sandy and Theresa.

16:33.993 --> 16:38.371
Every few decades you gotta shake
things up a bit or folks get suspicious.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.787
Don't you ever wanna shake things up?

16:40.917 --> 16:44.749
I feel pretty shaken up
most of the time anyway.

16:44.879 --> 16:48.331
- Do you want me to call anybody?
- And say what?

16:48.466 --> 16:53.840
- I could report a strange smell.
- If anyone cared, they'd come look.

16:55.015 --> 16:58.633
I don't feel the need
to make it easy for 'em.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.094
Good. Neither do I.

17:01.229 --> 17:07.481
What you could do is leave the back door open
and let the coyotes eat me.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.769
That'd make 'em think.

17:09.904 --> 17:13.190
- I'd feel shit if coyotes ate my mum.
- Damn right.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.816
'Cause you're a good boy.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.030
Oh, my God.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.621
My dad used to listen to Louis Prima.

17:23.752 --> 17:30.549
I worked with Louis.
It was at Frank Delaney's Terrace Room.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.760
- That's in Newark. Ever been?
- Can't say I have.

17:33.887 --> 17:39.427
It's a toilet.
But Louis had such a distinctive voice.

17:39.559 --> 17:43.473
Rub you all wrong
and it'd rub you all right.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.012
He was something else.

17:46.149 --> 17:49.648
- Is this collectable?
- I was raised on that washing powder.

17:49.778 --> 17:52.695
Those are the Gold Dust twins.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.108
Aren't they just
the cutest little jigaboos?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.451
Aren't you quite the racist!

17:59.579 --> 18:02.699
I even named a couple of dogs after 'em.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.703
They're the ones the coyotes dug up.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.244
You got lots of money anywhere?

18:12.050 --> 18:14.755
- Sit down.
- OK.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.549
Close your eyes.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.760
All right.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.356
What people? What sack?

18:35.990 --> 18:41.614
Reiterator people. They're inauthentic.
They have no idea who they are.

18:41.746 --> 18:45.329
They steal people's thoughts,
convinced they said it first.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.293
Almost all of them
have really greasy hair.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.543
Why can't people be more different?

18:51.673 --> 18:54.294
There's a finite number
of personalities

18:54.426 --> 18:56.465
and I have met them all.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.168
Why did you bring all these sacks over?

18:59.305 --> 19:01.594
To illustrate my point.

19:01.725 --> 19:05.936
- Which is what?
- People are not snowflakes.

19:07.230 --> 19:12.022
And I needed to clear out some room
in my closet. You don't mind, do you?

19:12.152 --> 19:14.144
I'd like to think Betty was wrong.

19:14.279 --> 19:18.063
People couldn't be clumped together
in sacks and shoeboxes.

19:18.199 --> 19:22.861
But after spending time at work,
I started to think maybe they could.

19:22.996 --> 19:26.163
Maybe people weren't
that different from one another.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.826
Hi, Millie.
Working hard or hardly working?

19:31.296 --> 19:35.246
Sacks and shoeboxes
might not be such a bad idea.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.459
For everything you love or hate,

19:37.594 --> 19:41.971
there are hundreds and thousands of
people who love or hate the same thing.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.672
I'm a cat person, Millie.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.300
Let me show you a picture of Murray.

19:50.565 --> 19:54.693
He's 15 years old. His bladder's going.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.983
Poor thing pissed
on the drapes yesterday.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.989
I just love him.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.450
Meow! Meow!

20:06.664 --> 20:09.416
That's why God made support groups.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.627
But there's no support group
for everything.

20:12.754 --> 20:16.372
I hate her! What a bitch!
Who does she think she is?

20:16.508 --> 20:20.126
It's hard enough without somebody
riding my ass every second

20:20.261 --> 20:22.337
of every goddamn day!

20:24.432 --> 20:27.219
No cure, no quick fix.

20:28.895 --> 20:33.308
One way or another,
you find your sack, crawl inside...

20:33.441 --> 20:35.481
Amber just got a wax.

20:35.610 --> 20:38.860
Five bucks says she'll show Raoul
by the end of business.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.028
.. and make the most of it.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.699
You're on.

20:42.826 --> 20:47.701
You're pushing too hard.
Just the one stroke on the F.

20:48.707 --> 20:51.114
You lifted the goddamn pen.

20:51.251 --> 20:56.625
And that N, it looks like an M.
There's no M in Florence.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.627
No wonder your children don't visit you.

20:59.759 --> 21:03.424
You want
my Social Security cheques or not?

21:08.893 --> 21:11.384
Why is it taking so long?

21:12.689 --> 21:17.517
I don't know. Maybe there's a few
synapses in there still firing.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.190
Am I cold?

21:20.321 --> 21:23.026
Go check and see if I'm cold.

21:29.622 --> 21:34.035
No, you're not really cold.
You're not warm either.

21:34.169 --> 21:37.751
Kind of like a room temperature,
like a soft Brie.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.708
Hey.

21:39.841 --> 21:45.048
You'll know when it happens.
It gets bright. You see something nice.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.931
What do you mean, something nice?

21:48.058 --> 21:50.216
Come on.

21:50.352 --> 21:54.598
Well, you see something nice
that you wanna see.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.767
It's all about you and what you want.

21:58.943 --> 22:02.988
- What'd you see when you died?
- I'm not officially dead.

22:03.114 --> 22:07.492
I didn't cross over, so I didn't get
a big light show, you know.

22:08.411 --> 22:12.160
It doesn't mean I don't have to watch
everybody else's.

22:12.290 --> 22:15.291
And they're not always pretty,
believe me.

22:15.418 --> 22:19.997
One bloke climbed right back inside
his mother before my very eyes.

22:20.131 --> 22:23.547
Jesus Christ, fella! Cut the...

22:24.552 --> 22:26.628
Jesus!

22:27.806 --> 22:32.598
As Mason was making friends,
I was fending off co-workers.

22:34.854 --> 22:38.769
Hi. Michael and I were thinking
of driving to the outlets at lunch.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.435
I hear there's a stationery store
you have to see to believe.

22:42.570 --> 22:45.240
- That sounds like fun.
- You can come with.

22:45.365 --> 22:49.363
I would, but I'm one month sober today,

22:49.494 --> 22:53.823
so my sponsor's
taking me to the park to fly kites.

22:54.749 --> 22:56.623
Oh.

22:57.877 --> 23:01.293
I used to have a kite.
Shaped like a dragon.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.542
I'll meet you
in front of the elevators on P2.

23:11.599 --> 23:17.638
I am... so proud of you.

23:17.772 --> 23:20.442
I look at you...

23:20.567 --> 23:26.190
.. and my heart swells with such pride.

23:31.703 --> 23:36.495
I act like I have it all together,
but I am no stranger to adversity.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.837
I went through a rough patch at your age.

23:41.963 --> 23:45.877
It was the '80s and everyone
was doing so much cocaine.

23:46.009 --> 23:48.582
We called it blow.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.843
I prayed for something, anything,

23:50.972 --> 23:54.092
to prevent more words
coming out of Delores's mouth.

23:54.225 --> 23:55.803
May I help you?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.845
- Ready?
- Anything but this.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.435
You're supposed to be downstairs.

24:00.565 --> 24:05.108
Hi. I'm Delores Herbig,
as in her big brown eyes.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.941
Nice to meet you
and your big brown eyes.

24:08.073 --> 24:10.445
- Are you Millie's sponsor?
- Yes.

24:10.575 --> 24:13.244
We're on our way to the park to fly kites.

24:13.370 --> 24:16.821
- You said that.
- These communal?

24:16.956 --> 24:19.827
Think of them as a well-deserved reward.

24:19.959 --> 24:23.293
It's wonderful to be
a shepherd to a young person.

24:23.421 --> 24:28.249
I myself am very happy to be
Millie's shepherd from nine to five.

24:28.385 --> 24:33.093
- How's Millie working out for you?
- Wonderful. She's very industrious.

24:33.223 --> 24:34.681
- Really?
- Absolutely.

24:34.808 --> 24:40.478
Doesn't give you any lip, does what she's told
or you gotta give her an occasional time-out?

24:40.605 --> 24:42.847
- She's an angel.
- This Millie here?

24:42.982 --> 24:45.604
She said I'm an angel. Drop it.

24:45.735 --> 24:48.653
- That's great.
- Can we go now?

24:51.324 --> 24:54.907
Do not touch your hair.
Promise me you won't touch your hair.

24:55.036 --> 24:58.286
Say, "I promise that
I will not touch my hair."

24:58.415 --> 25:00.703
- I promise.
- Let's go.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.910
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:16.474 --> 25:19.760
Today's the day
MJ Bowers is gonna die.

25:19.894 --> 25:24.058
If you're in the market for a Bowers soul,
this was the place to be.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.349
Nice day for a reunion.

25:26.484 --> 25:30.897
Had to do it today, rain or shine.
Bowers coming in from all over.

25:31.031 --> 25:35.111
- Is that a fact?
- Even all the way from Miami.

25:35.243 --> 25:38.279
Yeah? Well, you should have held it there.

25:38.413 --> 25:41.912
- You're not a Bowers, are you?
- No. Just by marriage.

25:43.752 --> 25:46.290
- This sucks.
- You're not by yourself.

25:46.421 --> 25:50.039
I had to work the Macy's
thanksgiving parade alone one year.

25:50.175 --> 25:54.042
There was this travesty
with a rogue Marmaduke balloon.

25:54.179 --> 25:59.600
Let's work the crowd. Look for high-risk factors
and try not to alarm anybody.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.434
OK.

26:01.561 --> 26:06.686
Betty always seems to go
a different way than everyone else.

26:06.816 --> 26:09.651
It was mysterious and reassuring.

26:09.778 --> 26:13.194
I wonder if she had a sack
for mysterious and reassuring.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.232
I'd put her picture in it.

26:16.201 --> 26:19.367
Age and wisdom had no impact on her.

26:19.496 --> 26:22.829
Just that strange light bulb
that lived in her stomach.

26:24.459 --> 26:28.207
Knowing that made my afterlife
a little more comfortable.

26:28.338 --> 26:30.829
Sorry. MJ? MJ?

26:31.675 --> 26:34.841
MJ? Any of you folks MJ Bowers?

26:36.846 --> 26:40.429
- Come on!
- Do it! Do it! You got her, Lou!

26:40.558 --> 26:42.634
MJ, buddy?

26:43.436 --> 26:45.844
She's a pit bull? They're real unstable.

26:45.980 --> 26:50.358
They go nuts and kill people all the time.
Has your dog ever done that?

26:52.904 --> 26:55.360
- Is your name MJ?
- What?

26:55.490 --> 26:59.440
My friend tells me go say hello to MJ.
She points to you.

26:59.577 --> 27:02.781
- Which friend?
- Pretty girl in the pant suit.

27:02.914 --> 27:06.663
That one? I don't know her.
What'd she point at me for?

27:06.793 --> 27:09.996
- Are you MJ Bowers?
- Who wants to know?

27:10.130 --> 27:13.249
We're all family.
I'm just asking your name.

27:13.383 --> 27:17.083
- I don't know you, sir.
- Rube. Hi. How are you?

27:17.220 --> 27:20.554
I'm tired of fucking around.
Are you MJ Bowers or not?

27:26.396 --> 27:28.305
George!

27:28.440 --> 27:31.310
MJ. You remember MJ?

27:31.985 --> 27:34.357
Hey. That's not MJ. I've got MJ.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.776
Marvin James is stuck in the tube slide.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.362
All the other children are piling in.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.699
They're packed in like sausage meat.

27:41.828 --> 27:46.823
There's a subtle distinction between
an MJ Bowers and the MJ Bowers.

27:46.958 --> 27:52.201
Comfortable and safe
or mysterious and reassuring?

27:54.674 --> 27:57.794
It didn't matter either way,
'cause time was up.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.682
Happy thoughts!

28:07.395 --> 28:11.475
Slow down! You stupid son of a bitch!

28:14.986 --> 28:18.936
I didn't see that one coming.
Then again, neither did he.

28:19.074 --> 28:22.858
Either way,
MJ Bowers ended up in a sack.

28:24.454 --> 28:28.534
But Betty had a way with the dead.
A deadside manner, I guess.

28:28.667 --> 28:31.074
The glass doesn't have to be half-empty.

28:31.211 --> 28:35.588
Know how much reconstructive surgery
you'd have if you'd survived? Lots.

28:35.715 --> 28:40.176
Lots and lots. Sure, it'd be worth it
if you were still alive,

28:40.303 --> 28:44.135
but since you're not,
it's just one less thing to worry about.

28:44.265 --> 28:47.884
Aren't you supposed to help me
send a message to my loved ones?

28:48.019 --> 28:50.973
I don't see Della Reese
sitting at this table.

28:51.523 --> 28:54.559
Look, you seem like a very nice man,

28:54.693 --> 28:59.769
but you can't expect us to drop a card
in the mail every time somebody dies.

28:59.906 --> 29:03.607
- Why not?
- Postage. It adds up.

29:03.743 --> 29:06.578
- This was my life?
- We don't get paid.

29:06.705 --> 29:09.908
- This is a public service.
- Really?

29:10.041 --> 29:13.991
Yeah. Stupid, huh? We should get paid,
at least minimum wage.

29:14.129 --> 29:17.332
- Look who's Norma Rae.
- My sister lives around the corner.

29:17.465 --> 29:21.795
- Write something on a napkin.
- You don't wanna mess with her head.

29:21.928 --> 29:25.842
People can't get notes from
their dearly departed. She'll go insane.

29:25.974 --> 29:28.465
This goes double for you.

29:28.601 --> 29:32.516
Tell her it's a note from Jesus,
and Jesus says I'm OK.

29:32.647 --> 29:35.185
Fine. Jesus'll leave a note.

29:35.316 --> 29:39.480
If he can walk on water,
I guess he can write a note.

29:39.612 --> 29:43.693
The curtain was coming down all over town.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.901
And a dirge would play.

30:06.181 --> 30:09.929
If this is Murray the dead cat,
I'm so outta here.

30:10.352 --> 30:12.593
Pay day.

30:12.729 --> 30:19.645
And to celebrate your very first
Happy Time pay cheque, Pay Day.

30:19.778 --> 30:23.111
Get it?
Allow me to pass on a helpful hint -

30:23.239 --> 30:27.948
that Pay Day label makes a great
title page for your work scrapbook.

30:28.078 --> 30:30.782
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Where's it going?

30:30.914 --> 30:34.579
Some new slingbacks?
A blazer for work?

30:34.709 --> 30:39.620
This is usually where I start
counting Delores's eyebrow hairs. But then...

30:39.756 --> 30:43.884
I was thinking about a terrarium.
I have a frog with no place to live.

30:44.010 --> 30:47.545
I started talking to her,
and I wasn't just bullshitting.

30:47.681 --> 30:49.757
I kind of didn't want her to leave.

30:49.891 --> 30:53.225
I like to sock away
10% of every pay cheque.

30:53.353 --> 30:56.223
Put the money someplace whimsical.

30:56.356 --> 30:59.523
A brightly coloured cigar box
is what works for me.

30:59.651 --> 31:02.403
- I call it my fun fund.
- Fun fund?

31:03.196 --> 31:07.490
I go wild every once in a while,
buy something frivolous, just for me.

31:07.617 --> 31:09.277
It used to be the...

31:10.954 --> 31:16.826
Last month I bought the most adorable
ashtray and I don't even smoke.

31:17.585 --> 31:21.583
How's your cat? How's Murray?

31:21.715 --> 31:26.626
Oh, thank you for asking.
His bladder's not good.

31:31.725 --> 31:35.722
Cashed in my first pay cheque today.
Bought a terrarium for my frog.

31:35.854 --> 31:39.305
- You got a frog?
- He followed me from the train wreck.

31:39.441 --> 31:41.979
That's a lot of jumping.
I like jumping...

31:42.110 --> 31:44.897
- Maybe you're frog people.
- Maybe.

31:45.030 --> 31:48.315
Or maybe I just can't sit still for too long.

31:48.450 --> 31:52.827
In retrospect,
that's the moment she decided to do it.

31:55.749 --> 31:57.825
On the bar with you!

32:02.297 --> 32:07.125
I would like to thank you all
for coming to my... birthday.

32:08.845 --> 32:13.139
Some of you are beloved co-workers.
Some of you are lifelong friends.

32:13.266 --> 32:16.101
But to me, you're all family.

32:17.145 --> 32:21.012
I love you all, especially you, Maggie.

32:21.149 --> 32:24.684
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

32:24.819 --> 32:27.690
On top of a bar getting piss drunk!

32:29.115 --> 32:34.739
But, but, but... as much as I love you all,
this day is not about you.

32:35.747 --> 32:39.032
It's about me.
It's about what I want to do.

32:39.167 --> 32:42.334
And you all know what I want to do.

33:11.616 --> 33:13.858
Excuse me. Have we met before?

33:13.993 --> 33:17.528
I think we might have
a long, long time ago.

33:17.664 --> 33:19.906
Happy thoughts.

34:05.837 --> 34:07.248
Oh, no.

34:13.678 --> 34:17.427
I know you were having fun in there.
Sorry you couldn't stay.

34:17.556 --> 34:22.800
It might have been short,
but I can't argue with the time I did have.

34:27.275 --> 34:31.771
- The cliffs of Dover.
- Best thing about cliffs is jumping.

34:31.905 --> 34:36.068
I'm not much for jumping.
I'm not much for landing either.

34:38.620 --> 34:42.155
You don't have to worry
about where you land.

34:44.042 --> 34:47.292
Leap of faith?

34:58.431 --> 35:02.809
If you've been putting off a jump,
just putting it off,

35:02.936 --> 35:07.016
sometimes the subtle things
are what make you take the plunge.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.982
- Here. Take my picture.
- What?

35:12.112 --> 35:14.235
- Take my picture.
- Why?

35:14.364 --> 35:16.024
Happy thoughts.

35:16.991 --> 35:19.661
For my beautiful young friend.

35:19.786 --> 35:21.862
I love you, sweetie.

35:22.706 --> 35:25.576
- What are you doing?
- Trying to shake things up.

35:25.709 --> 35:29.409
- Piggyback ride.
- We can't go where they're going!

35:29.546 --> 35:34.006
Open door's an invitation.
Gotta jump while the door's open!

35:53.737 --> 35:57.188
And just like that, she was gone.

36:37.155 --> 36:39.231
We lead our lives,

36:39.366 --> 36:44.074
and when they end, sometimes
we leave a little of ourselves behind.

36:46.790 --> 36:50.408
Sometimes we leave money, a painting.

36:55.006 --> 36:57.628
Sometimes we leave a kind word.

36:57.759 --> 36:59.419
Jesus?

37:01.721 --> 37:05.256
And sometimes
we leave an empty space.

37:08.019 --> 37:10.890
Can't go where she went.

37:11.022 --> 37:13.098
I know.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.643
She was a pistol.

37:16.778 --> 37:20.562
I don't understand. Where did she go?

37:20.699 --> 37:23.190
She's coming back, right?

37:24.703 --> 37:28.321
- I don't know.
- God, I hate this.

37:30.875 --> 37:34.624
Betty told me that
Millie had an older brother.

37:36.006 --> 37:37.251
No.

37:40.218 --> 37:42.294
She had an older sister.

37:45.598 --> 37:48.469
And she was fearless.

37:49.060 --> 37:52.595
Yeah. She was a real pistol.

37:53.648 --> 38:00.481
Why do I keep losing all the things
and people that I care about?

38:03.575 --> 38:06.066
That's what life is, peanut.

38:12.667 --> 38:17.329
How does death deal with death?
The same way the living do.

38:17.464 --> 38:22.375
Trying to make sense of something
that'll never quite make sense.

38:22.510 --> 38:26.638
Don't be bashful.
I was a beginner once too.

38:33.104 --> 38:35.560
Mysterious and reassuring.

38:35.690 --> 38:37.897
Uh-huh.

38:42.405 --> 38:45.608
All these people, they all have it.

38:45.742 --> 38:48.945
Around their eyes, in their smile.

38:49.079 --> 38:52.530
The reassuring part is...

38:52.665 --> 38:57.043
.. what lulls you into the sense
that everything's gonna be fine

38:57.170 --> 39:00.420
and then, boom,

39:00.548 --> 39:03.834
they pull the rug
out from underneath you.

39:05.011 --> 39:07.882
That's the mystery part.

39:09.766 --> 39:12.471
I'm gonna stop you right here.

39:12.602 --> 39:17.430
Common rookie move in scrapbooking.
Turning them into photo albums.

39:17.565 --> 39:21.515
The first thing they teach you
about scrapbooks, rule number one,

39:21.653 --> 39:24.358
is that they are not photo albums.

39:25.532 --> 39:28.486
Scrapbooking is an art form...

40:00.900 --> 40:05.028
When you can't
make sense of someone leaving,

40:05.155 --> 40:08.820
you sometimes try to make sense
of what they left behind.

40:11.202 --> 40:16.197
And it makes it a whole lot easier
when what they left you was beautiful.
