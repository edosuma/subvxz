WEBVTT

01:50.275 --> 01:53.955
Kim Young Joo, are you satisfied?

02:03.755 --> 02:05.225
Go.

02:21.645 --> 02:23.364
Are you okay, Prosecutor?

02:23.365 --> 02:25.585
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:26.585 --> 02:29.595
Hurry up and move.
We have to capture him.

02:39.005 --> 02:42.785
The City Hunter is wearing a black jacket.
We can't lose him.

03:02.665 --> 03:04.785
A black jacket?

03:29.395 --> 03:32.105
<i>What?
Chun Jae Man escaped?</i>

03:43.065 --> 03:47.094
He was very cooperative when we brought
him in, so we weren't really concerned.

03:47.095 --> 03:49.014
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

03:49.015 --> 03:50.924
How many minutes ago
did you last check on him?

03:50.925 --> 03:54.734
The guard said he was definitely still here
five minutes ago.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.285
What were you guys thinking?!

03:59.695 --> 04:01.325
I understand...

04:13.925 --> 04:16.714
There's no way
that Chairman Chun escaped on his own.

04:16.904 --> 04:19.803
There's definitely someone
inside the department who helped him.

04:19.805 --> 04:21.154
Then an inside job?

04:21.154 --> 04:23.435
He couldn't have gotten far.

04:23.645 --> 04:26.564
Get an arrest warrant
for Chairman Chun first.

04:26.565 --> 04:28.714
Check around the building
and all possible escape routes.

04:28.715 --> 04:31.624
Focus on places he could be hiding out

04:31.625 --> 04:33.154
and ask the police to cooperate.

04:33.155 --> 04:34.835
Yes.

04:36.665 --> 04:42.585
The key is not to be bound by the belief
that starting anew is impossible.

04:42.815 --> 04:45.414
If you feel aggrieved
or commit wrongs against others,

04:45.415 --> 04:47.591
or over justify your mistakes,

04:47.626 --> 04:50.165
then it is impossible to start anew.

04:50.185 --> 04:52.214
[I Am Precious]

04:53.185 --> 04:54.605
You're sleeping again...

04:58.215 --> 05:02.065
How can you fall asleep
during such a crucial section?

05:02.645 --> 05:03.924
How many times do I have to tell you

05:03.925 --> 05:07.785
rough people like you need to have
your minds cleansed with books like these!

05:09.525 --> 05:12.344
Every time Yoon Sung goes out for work
and I feel nervous or scared,

05:12.345 --> 05:15.325
I read this book and...
you're staring again.

05:16.445 --> 05:19.495
Eyes. Eyes!

05:21.325 --> 05:22.965
<i>Ahjussi.</i>

05:23.525 --> 05:25.114
Yoon Sung must be back.

05:25.115 --> 05:28.355
I'll read it for you when I come back,
just wait.

05:30.695 --> 05:33.745
You said Prosecutor Kim saw your face?

05:33.985 --> 05:35.104
Yeah.

05:35.105 --> 05:38.754
Stay calm, stay calm,
Yoon Sung let's stay calm.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.970
I'm going to go start packing. No...

05:40.971 --> 05:43.237
Ah, no wait...
You... you reserve a flight.

05:43.265 --> 05:46.952
No, it's better to stowaway on a boat.
Also,

05:46.987 --> 05:51.194
I'll tell Na Na to get your mom
and to meet us in Busan.

05:51.195 --> 05:53.605
My phone... where did it go?

05:53.715 --> 05:58.595
What do you mean stow away?
You always overreact.

05:59.585 --> 06:00.624
Don't worry.

06:00.625 --> 06:01.634
Prosecutor Kim isn't going to come here.

06:01.635 --> 06:03.234
What do you mean he's not coming, Punk?!

06:03.235 --> 06:07.464
He's been searching everywhere for you
because of what happened to his dad.

06:07.465 --> 06:10.006
And he even knows your name.
Poo Chai, Poo Chai.

06:10.039 --> 06:10.921
That...

06:11.055 --> 06:13.564
I can't live if you get caught, Yoon Sung.

06:13.565 --> 06:15.265
Kim Young Joo...

06:16.295 --> 06:17.634
he just let me go.

06:17.635 --> 06:21.235
What?
He just let you go?

06:21.345 --> 06:22.934
He saw your face but he still let you go?

06:22.935 --> 06:25.035
Really? Seriously?

06:27.065 --> 06:28.236
<i>This afternoon, the City Hunter</i>

06:28.237 --> 06:31.778
<i>once again delivered Chairman Chun
to the Prosecutor's Office,</i>

06:31.813 --> 06:35.704
<i>but Chairman Chun disappeared from
the waiting room at the Prosecutor's Office.</i>

06:35.705 --> 06:38.804
The City Hunter caught him for you
but you lost him?

06:39.156 --> 06:40.754
I should have been there.

06:40.755 --> 06:43.284
Be quiet, I can't hear.

06:43.285 --> 06:46.104
Move aside, so I can see too.

06:47.392 --> 06:49.914
The police on a stakeout...?

06:49.915 --> 06:53.034
<i>The following report is breaking news
on the escape of Chairman Chun.</i>

06:53.035 --> 06:54.404
<i>Prosecutors and police are joining forces</i>

06:54.405 --> 06:56.314
<i>to search the areas
near the Prosecutor's Office.</i>

06:56.315 --> 06:57.704
<i>Police forces in the Kangnam area
are being dispatched urgently.</i>

06:57.705 --> 07:00.394
<i>The dozens of fake City Hunters who appeared
in front of the Prosecutor's Office Building</i>

07:00.395 --> 07:05.364
<i>have been arrested by police forces
waiting to ambush the real City Hunter.</i>

07:05.365 --> 07:06.358
<i>The police confirmed</i>

07:06.359 --> 07:09.015
<i>the fake City Hunters gathered there after
seeing a message he left on his fan cafe,</i>

07:09.016 --> 07:10.224
<i>that they could meet him there
disguised with a mask.</i>

07:10.225 --> 07:12.715
<i>They have all been released with a warning.</i>

07:29.995 --> 07:32.645
[Unlucky Jerk]

07:34.925 --> 07:36.825
[Bear Na Na]

07:48.945 --> 07:50.265
[Unlucky Jerk]

07:57.805 --> 07:59.795
He's definitely going to come back.

08:06.545 --> 08:09.005
I'll definitely stay alive and go back.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.485
What the he** are you doing?
Huh?!

08:26.335 --> 08:28.727
I am utterly speechless.

08:28.728 --> 08:33.506
Not just me, but the department and district
heads are all about to get fired!

08:33.595 --> 08:35.635
It was humiliating enough that
the City Hunter had to deliver him to us,

08:35.635 --> 08:37.571
but we lost him too.

08:37.794 --> 08:40.004
Da** it!

08:40.005 --> 08:41.166
I'm sorry.

08:41.167 --> 08:43.839
I'll bring in Chairman Chun
as soon as possible.

08:43.845 --> 08:45.304
Of course you will.

08:45.305 --> 08:48.454
I have a bad personality
so I can't work as a defense attorney.

08:48.455 --> 08:50.004
You're the same too.

08:50.005 --> 08:51.785
Whatever, whatever...

08:51.795 --> 08:55.044
You know full well that the more time passes
after an escape, the harder it gets, right?

08:55.045 --> 08:59.174
No matter what you have to do,
catch him before the City Hunter does.

08:59.175 --> 09:00.114
Okay.

09:00.115 --> 09:01.556
But you...

09:02.261 --> 09:05.429
You really didn't see City Hunter's face?

09:06.095 --> 09:07.584
The police chasing him right behind you

09:07.585 --> 09:11.105
said that
you were standing right next to him.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.064
I didn't see him.

09:12.065 --> 09:13.224
He stole my gun.

09:13.225 --> 09:16.365
So why did you get your gun stolen?

09:17.565 --> 09:20.044
And then?
What happened to the gun?

09:20.045 --> 09:23.204
It was found nearby,
but there were no fingerprints.

09:23.205 --> 09:26.445
Okay, leave.

09:30.555 --> 09:33.205
Da** it!

09:48.375 --> 09:50.375
Why did you let me go?

09:50.765 --> 09:53.215
Why did I let you go?

09:56.215 --> 09:59.205
If I was Kim Jong Shik's son
Kim Young Joo...

09:59.545 --> 10:01.365
Lee Yoon Sung, you...

10:02.295 --> 10:05.065
Would've been caught red-handed
and arrested right away.

10:06.185 --> 10:08.115
But I thought about it and

10:09.265 --> 10:13.545
the City Hunter can do things the law can't.

10:15.645 --> 10:18.565
I don't have any right to arrest you,

10:20.045 --> 10:22.345
since you defeated the law.

10:23.525 --> 10:25.425
That's quite like you, Kim Young Joo,

10:25.765 --> 10:29.145
inflexible and no fun.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.505
Kim Young Joo,

10:32.265 --> 10:34.805
next time, if the same thing happens again,
don't be so sentimental,

10:34.895 --> 10:38.834
and do your duty as a prosecutor.

10:38.835 --> 10:40.395
And you?

10:42.455 --> 10:44.785
Why did you let me live?

10:45.905 --> 10:47.885
Same reason as you.

10:52.975 --> 10:54.744
I should go.

10:54.745 --> 10:56.854
Thanks to a certain someone,
I have to work overtime.

10:56.855 --> 10:59.254
Did you find the classified documents
Chairman Chun had?

10:59.255 --> 11:00.904
It has nothing to with you.

11:00.905 --> 11:05.084
I want to know, the 1983 incident.

11:05.085 --> 11:06.915
Then look for them,

11:06.995 --> 11:10.155
Chairman Chun and the classified documents.

11:10.885 --> 11:13.035
You're going to be busy, Kim Young Joo.

11:30.865 --> 11:32.504
<i>City Hunter?</i>

11:32.505 --> 11:35.475
Chairman Chun, you're quite impressive.

11:38.285 --> 11:40.114
You must be in a noisy place.

11:40.115 --> 11:46.075
I have the files
classified as top secret until 2030.

11:46.535 --> 11:51.664
If you stop chasing after me,
I'll hand them over to you.

11:51.665 --> 11:53.004
Forget it,

11:53.005 --> 11:54.664
I'll look for it myself,

11:54.665 --> 11:57.634
the classified documents and you too,
Chairman Chun.

11:57.635 --> 11:59.825
You impertinent boy.

12:00.485 --> 12:03.795
You're going to regret rejecting my offer.

12:08.575 --> 12:12.855
The classified documents,
he hasn't destroyed them?

12:15.435 --> 12:18.185
He said he was going to hide it
in a secret place.

12:19.935 --> 12:25.164
I don't know where it's hidden,
but he hasn't destroyed it yet, I'm sure.

12:25.165 --> 12:26.575
Yeah?

12:26.945 --> 12:30.665
Any idea where he might be hiding out?

12:31.455 --> 12:35.645
If it's Chairman Chun, he'll still be
thinking about how to climb back up again.

12:35.875 --> 12:41.575
He probably has a couple people like me
still working under him,

12:41.945 --> 12:44.255
since he always uses cash to buy off people.

12:44.505 --> 12:50.484
Then, to get back to the top, where and who
would Chairman Chun be meeting?

12:50.785 --> 12:52.805
Tell me if you know anything.

12:53.925 --> 12:55.855
If I tell you,

12:57.515 --> 13:00.205
can you do what I want?

13:05.445 --> 13:09.915
Finish off Chun Jae Man for good.

13:13.695 --> 13:15.435
I promise you.

13:18.055 --> 13:22.934
A long time ago, he told me to find a woman,
saying she was some sort of hidden card.

13:22.935 --> 13:25.364
He's probably going to try to look for her.

13:25.365 --> 13:27.164
Every time he came back
from meeting the president,

13:27.165 --> 13:29.704
he'd rage at me to go find her.

13:29.705 --> 13:30.844
Who is she?

13:30.845 --> 13:33.535
She used to run a sidewalk snack shop

13:33.695 --> 13:36.305
but I couldn't find her
because she left the country.

13:36.555 --> 13:40.725
Her name is Lee Kyung Hee.

13:45.475 --> 13:48.985
Lee... Kyung Hee?

13:56.255 --> 13:59.935
I think the boss purposely didn't show you
the classified documents.

13:59.985 --> 14:04.175
He said it was better to let it disappear
than have you see it.

14:13.655 --> 14:15.642
These documents were selected

14:15.643 --> 14:18.682
from the files confiscated
from Chairman Chun's house and office.

14:18.755 --> 14:19.874
There are so many.

14:19.875 --> 14:21.024
When are we going to look at all of these?

14:21.025 --> 14:22.844
We'll do an all-nighter if we have to.

14:22.845 --> 14:25.425
Oh and Prosecutor, take a look at this.

14:26.825 --> 14:31.064
We searched his safe in his beach house
and this was in there.

14:31.065 --> 14:36.245
I thought it was something important
since it was so safely secured.

14:37.305 --> 14:39.405
Sunflower.

14:39.585 --> 14:41.455
Sunflower...

14:50.715 --> 14:52.445
Helianthus.

14:58.895 --> 15:00.745
Helianthus flower.

15:02.275 --> 15:05.215
Helianthus is another name for sunflower...

15:10.415 --> 15:13.874
[Lee Kyung Hee]

15:14.275 --> 15:16.005
Lee Kyung Hee?

15:36.805 --> 15:41.014
Even though it's just a painting,
isn't this plant amazing?

15:41.015 --> 15:45.114
It has no branches,
and lives solely off its own leaves.

15:45.115 --> 15:48.005
I think it's 100 times more impressive
than humans.

15:48.615 --> 15:53.165
These days,
without money, education, and connections,

15:53.465 --> 15:56.584
it's difficult to stay alive.

15:56.585 --> 15:59.174
But if the Private School Amendment
gets passed,

15:59.175 --> 16:04.614
it will be very helpful for students
who rely solely on themselves.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.793
The truth is,
during the election four years ago,

16:06.794 --> 16:10.065
because of the Private School Amendment
you described during your election speech,

16:10.066 --> 16:12.174
I believed in you and voted for you.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.304
There will be good news at the next meeting
of the National Assembly.

16:15.305 --> 16:17.154
Have faith, Mr. President.

16:17.205 --> 16:18.925
Thank you.

16:20.955 --> 16:24.145
I should take a picture of this
and put it up on my blog.

16:25.035 --> 16:26.918
I'm going to collect them one by one

16:26.919 --> 16:30.341
and have a personal art show
after I leave office.

16:32.475 --> 16:34.514
Mr. President...

16:34.515 --> 16:38.114
It's an unknown number, what should I do?

16:38.115 --> 16:39.785
Give it here.

16:47.185 --> 16:48.644
Hello?

16:48.645 --> 16:50.965
<i>It's me, Chun Jae Man.</i>

16:51.295 --> 16:52.945
Hold on.

16:52.985 --> 16:55.245
Could you step outside, please?

16:58.585 --> 16:59.884
Go on.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.935
I'll get straight to the point.

17:02.765 --> 17:05.394
Help me leave the country.

17:05.395 --> 17:08.635
You should know what my answer will be.

17:11.605 --> 17:13.444
Turn yourself in.

17:13.595 --> 17:16.155
If you keep pushing me
to the edge like this...

17:17.505 --> 17:19.473
You do remember Lee Kyung Hee, right?

17:19.474 --> 17:23.885
Twenty eight years ago,
she gave birth to your son.

17:24.714 --> 17:25.604
What?

17:25.605 --> 17:28.635
What do you think will happen
if the president whom the citizens love

17:28.655 --> 17:34.375
had an affair with a bar hostess
and had an illegitimate child?

17:34.685 --> 17:36.914
<i>You don't have to be so shocked.</i>

17:36.915 --> 17:40.435
Even though you act all clean and pure,

17:40.915 --> 17:44.405
you used my money as a stepping stone
to get into the Blue House.

17:46.575 --> 17:50.873
The Private School Amendment you've been
preparing since you came to office,

17:50.908 --> 17:53.837
do you want it to fall through
because of you?

17:55.505 --> 17:57.035
<i>My condition is simple.</i>

17:58.815 --> 18:01.665
You just have to get me out of the country.

18:11.605 --> 18:14.784
He disappeared after taking my baby
who was only a month old.

18:14.785 --> 18:16.514
That was the last I heard from him.

18:16.515 --> 18:18.925
Just wait a little.

18:19.155 --> 18:22.435
You'll soon see my gift to you.

18:26.945 --> 18:30.445
Send in Agent Kim Na Na.

18:34.595 --> 18:41.025
Do you know where the woman
who gave you the handkerchief is?

18:42.425 --> 18:43.775
What?

18:44.725 --> 18:48.934
There's someone whom I owe a great debt to,

18:48.935 --> 18:51.645
and I think it's the same person.

18:51.815 --> 18:55.835
If you know, will you please tell me?

19:06.155 --> 19:08.225
With this, you still won't tell me?

19:34.965 --> 19:37.206
After 4 months,
if there are no complications,

19:37.207 --> 19:39.223
you can be discharged from the hospital.

19:39.255 --> 19:42.595
Just wait a little longer
even if it's stuffy in here.

19:43.285 --> 19:44.695
Okay.

19:45.565 --> 19:47.065
Mom...

19:51.185 --> 19:52.875
Are you okay?

19:57.785 --> 19:59.505
Thank you.

19:59.845 --> 20:01.834
You're carrying this around.

20:01.835 --> 20:05.504
Yeah.
I heard you gave one to Na Na too.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.844
Yeah.

20:06.845 --> 20:11.045
It's a gift I give to people I like.

20:12.115 --> 20:14.025
To Dad too?

20:17.415 --> 20:19.005
Yes.

20:19.040 --> 20:23.195
Did you want to ask me something?

20:23.635 --> 20:27.615
Never mind, I'll get you more water.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.665
If...

20:34.275 --> 20:36.635
Really just if...

20:40.155 --> 20:42.715
If your father was alive,

20:42.775 --> 20:46.795
it would be a good thing for you, right?

20:47.835 --> 20:51.405
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

20:55.225 --> 20:56.935
It's nothing.

21:16.905 --> 21:20.355
Why was Chairman Chun looking for Mom?

21:35.925 --> 21:37.734
Oh, Ahjussi, it's me.

21:37.735 --> 21:40.654
Remember the person you contacted
while looking for mom?

21:40.655 --> 21:42.955
Can I have her contact information?

21:47.965 --> 21:51.224
Kyung Hee has had a tough life.

21:51.225 --> 21:55.155
She worked in order to raise money
for the treatment of her dad's lung disease.

21:55.345 --> 21:59.255
But, I don't know if I should be talking
about someone's life like this.

22:00.015 --> 22:03.915
Tell me everything you know, please.

22:04.695 --> 22:07.994
I don't know too well either,

22:07.995 --> 22:10.094
and it's been a while too.

22:10.095 --> 22:13.025
I just overheard a few things
here and there...

22:13.545 --> 22:16.755
No, there's no point in talking
about the past.

22:18.485 --> 22:22.035
I'll compensate you well, please.

22:25.265 --> 22:30.904
I'm not too sure, but it's something I heard
after I quit Pal Pan Gab.

22:30.905 --> 22:32.895
There was a rumor that Kyung Hee

22:34.825 --> 22:39.394
got married after getting pregnant
with someone else's baby.

22:39.395 --> 22:43.464
The husband knew all that
and still accepted her.

22:43.465 --> 22:46.504
She was pregnant with someone else's baby?

22:46.505 --> 22:48.284
Yes.

22:48.285 --> 22:51.895
But, not long after getting married,
that man went missing,

22:51.896 --> 22:54.373
and then the baby went missing too.

22:54.645 --> 22:59.365
I told you, Kyung Hee has had a tough life.

23:11.415 --> 23:13.975
[Bear Na Na]

23:15.055 --> 23:16.545
Yeah.

23:16.725 --> 23:20.454
The sunflower handkerchief
that Ajumeoni gave me last time,

23:20.455 --> 23:23.684
the president has the same exact one.

23:23.685 --> 23:25.984
<i>I didn't tell him before
because Ajumeoni told me not to,</i>

23:25.985 --> 23:30.225
<i>but he's been asking about her since then,
saying that he owes her.</i>

23:30.485 --> 23:35.385
But I thought you should at least know.

23:35.975 --> 23:38.065
Are you listening?

23:38.875 --> 23:40.255
Yeah,

23:41.045 --> 23:43.624
so did you tell him where she is?

23:43.625 --> 23:44.734
No.

23:44.735 --> 23:50.194
I told him that I don't know,
but it was just bothering me.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.734
Good job, don't tell him no matter what.

23:52.735 --> 23:56.014
Um... Nothing has happened, right?

23:56.015 --> 23:57.724
You don't sound well.

23:57.725 --> 24:01.255
I'm fine, I'll call you later.

24:11.465 --> 24:13.495
You don't eat beans?

24:15.285 --> 24:16.264
You're the same.

24:16.265 --> 24:18.494
Uh? Teacher,
you pull out the beans from your rice too.

24:18.495 --> 24:20.684
Yeah, I don't like beans.

24:20.685 --> 24:25.245
If my mom sees it,
she'd nag the three of us.

24:25.605 --> 24:27.964
Every time he came back
from meeting the president,

24:27.965 --> 24:30.985
he'd rage at me to go find her.

24:47.425 --> 24:49.225
Yoon Sung.

24:57.055 --> 24:59.025
What's wrong?

25:00.845 --> 25:04.035
You don't look well, did something happen?

25:13.535 --> 25:17.625
Mom, I'm not blaming you.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.445
Just...

25:21.465 --> 25:23.465
I'm sorry.

25:24.215 --> 25:25.885
I'm sorry,

25:28.465 --> 25:30.535
I found out everything.

25:33.605 --> 25:35.135
About what?

25:36.795 --> 25:38.865
My biological father...

25:43.575 --> 25:45.705
is President Choi Eung Chan.

25:47.465 --> 25:49.035
Am I right?

25:55.415 --> 25:56.975
Is he...

25:58.535 --> 26:00.995
really my biological father?

26:04.235 --> 26:06.165
I'm sorry

26:07.355 --> 26:09.775
for not telling you.

26:12.505 --> 26:16.555
Did he abandon us?

26:19.375 --> 26:25.375
He didn't even know I was pregnant
or that you were born.

26:27.055 --> 26:32.435
When I became pregnant with you,
he already had a family.

26:33.275 --> 26:36.635
Chairman Chun knew I was pregnant.

26:37.545 --> 26:43.095
He said I was going to impede his future,
so he threatened me.

26:43.995 --> 26:49.995
The person who saved me
was Park Moo Yul.

26:56.745 --> 27:01.435
You're disappointed that your mom
is this sort of person, right?

27:09.105 --> 27:11.135
What do you mean disappointed?

27:11.595 --> 27:15.205
I'm not blaming you
and I'm not disappointed.

27:17.155 --> 27:22.265
The fact that you're alive
is the greatest joy to me.

27:36.445 --> 27:39.045
The father who raised me,

27:40.015 --> 27:41.855
did he know too?

27:43.905 --> 27:46.045
Jin Pyo?

27:54.285 --> 27:56.385
He knew?

28:16.335 --> 28:18.326
You stay alive

28:18.327 --> 28:24.789
and nail a bullet into the heart
of your father's and my enemy.

28:24.824 --> 28:29.015
Me because I alone lived
in the waters off Nampo,

28:29.525 --> 28:32.675
and you because you are Moo Yul's son.

29:05.625 --> 29:07.515
Why?

29:09.125 --> 29:11.575
Why did you do that?

29:14.275 --> 29:18.215
Why did you raise me, while lying
that I am someone else's son?

29:19.315 --> 29:21.785
When I am Choi Eung Chan's son...

29:36.405 --> 29:38.765
I will figure it out.

29:40.165 --> 29:41.745
Also,

29:43.075 --> 29:49.815
you'll have to pay
for tearing apart and destroying my life.

31:05.345 --> 31:07.165
The car is nice, right?

31:07.845 --> 31:11.815
You're copying Lee Yoon Sung on everything,
even the car.

31:12.025 --> 31:13.269
I'm not copying.

31:13.270 --> 31:17.507
I too... I liked this car too
and it was time to change cars.

31:18.145 --> 31:19.959
I'm taking you for a test drive,

31:19.960 --> 31:22.527
shouldn't you at least
pay me some lip-service?

31:27.435 --> 31:29.135
Dr. Lee.

31:39.605 --> 31:43.635
Go Ki Joon changed his car,
and bought the same one as yours.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.375
Only the color is different,
the style is the same...

31:49.915 --> 31:51.595
What's with him?

31:52.155 --> 31:54.455
Is he angry
that I bought the same car as him?

31:56.495 --> 31:57.964
Seriously...

31:57.965 --> 32:01.714
It's been a while since we met
but you're asking about another guy.

32:01.715 --> 32:03.454
That's so like you, Kim Young Joo.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.044
Tell me the truth.

32:05.045 --> 32:08.684
When Lee Yoon Sung was shot,
you treated him.

32:08.685 --> 32:10.315
I don't know.

32:12.085 --> 32:13.464
I don't know.

32:13.465 --> 32:16.594
Are you going to keep doing this
to someone who doesn't know?

32:16.595 --> 32:20.514
I left my jacket at your house last time.

32:20.515 --> 32:21.674
When should I come to pick it up?

32:21.675 --> 32:25.654
Lee Yoon Sung went by the name Poo Chai
in the Golden Triangle.

32:25.655 --> 32:27.774
He came to Korea with a new identity.

32:27.775 --> 32:32.614
Because of the incident in 1983, he's
working on a project to mete out punishment.

32:32.615 --> 32:36.064
Young Joo, I'm sorry about
what happened to your father, but...

32:36.065 --> 32:38.515
This hurts my pride as a prosecutor...

32:40.915 --> 32:43.105
I keep having to acknowledge that.

32:43.355 --> 32:46.444
More and more, I feel like his methods
are actually more correct than mine.

32:46.445 --> 32:48.505
I'm angry and irritated,

32:49.395 --> 32:51.915
but there's nothing I can do.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.325
The law lost...

32:56.275 --> 32:58.095
to that jerk.

33:00.415 --> 33:03.085
You should have shown me
this side of you earlier.

33:03.545 --> 33:06.465
I left because you were so perfect.

33:07.135 --> 33:11.305
But today,
I kind of want to be by your side.

33:12.845 --> 33:17.325
Lee Yoon Sung is a lot like you.

33:18.135 --> 33:21.115
He seems really lonely too.

33:22.465 --> 33:26.134
I don't know how he lived
but his back was covered by scars.

33:26.135 --> 33:29.765
He was so proficient at removing the bullet
from his own shoulder,

33:31.115 --> 33:33.375
I pitied him.

33:33.825 --> 33:38.765
You know that I can't just pass by a dog
who has lost his way.

33:40.215 --> 33:43.255
You're like that too, aren't you?

33:48.975 --> 33:52.024
I bought these sunflowers
because they're pretty. What do you think?

33:52.025 --> 33:54.615
We used to go to Namsan often.

33:54.725 --> 33:58.805
Looking at these sunflowers
makes me think about those days.

34:04.545 --> 34:06.275
Sunflower.

34:07.905 --> 34:09.735
Sunflower.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.195
[President's Blog]

34:30.625 --> 34:33.565
<i>Chairman Chun, you're quite impressive.</i>

34:36.405 --> 34:38.254
<i>You must be in a noisy place.</i>

34:38.255 --> 34:44.175
<i>I have the files
classified as top secret until 2030.</i>

34:48.955 --> 34:50.735
That sound...

34:52.185 --> 34:54.245
Where can it be?

34:59.015 --> 35:01.565
[Kim Young Joo]

35:04.715 --> 35:07.755
Here, coffee.

35:10.235 --> 35:13.145
Prosecutor, please enjoy it.

35:30.135 --> 35:31.314
Let me ask you one thing.

35:31.315 --> 35:32.984
When have you ever asked for permission
before posing a question?

35:32.985 --> 35:37.625
Everything you did in the name of revenge,

35:37.845 --> 35:40.835
ended up correcting
the corruption in our society.

35:42.255 --> 35:44.474
If that corruption

35:44.475 --> 35:47.565
isn't related to your revenge in any way,

35:48.135 --> 35:50.405
would you still have done it?

35:51.075 --> 35:52.784
I am just curious,

35:52.785 --> 35:57.975
if it isn't for the revenge,
if you could still have become City Hunter.

35:59.655 --> 36:01.424
I'm asking purely out of curiosity.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.705
I put my life on the line to do this task.

36:04.285 --> 36:08.934
Although revenge is also important,
for me to wager my life,

36:08.935 --> 36:11.365
there needs to be a strong enough motivation
to spur me into action.

36:12.475 --> 36:17.675
If it were you, could you just stand by
and watch others suffer and be in pain?

36:19.065 --> 36:20.965
That's quite like you, Lee Yoon Sung.

36:31.015 --> 36:34.105
It's fine.
Let him go.

36:43.085 --> 36:47.745
You're visiting me too often,
Prosecutor Kim.

36:48.675 --> 36:50.034
And the reason you're here?

36:50.035 --> 36:52.055
I'm curious about something.

36:53.215 --> 36:57.735
Lee Yoon Sung said
he doesn't regret becoming the City Hunter.

36:58.215 --> 37:03.315
He said he can't just stand by
and watch people suffer and be in pain.

37:04.405 --> 37:06.945
I liked that answer,

37:06.965 --> 37:08.312
compared to someone else's revenge plan

37:08.313 --> 37:11.524
to kidnap an innocent baby
and raise him to become a killer.

37:11.525 --> 37:14.415
Lee Yoon Sung's revenge can be rationalized,

37:15.025 --> 37:18.935
but I can't forgive
this bloody revenge of yours.

37:19.245 --> 37:21.824
Why would I need to seek your forgiveness?

37:21.825 --> 37:24.345
There's no way that you didn't know,

37:24.435 --> 37:27.435
that Park Moo Yul isn't
Lee Yoon Sung's biological father.

37:29.375 --> 37:32.914
I'm not interested in how you survived
off the shores of Nampo,

37:32.915 --> 37:34.370
but,

37:34.371 --> 37:39.339
I want to know why you took
Lee Yoon Sung and raised him.

37:39.355 --> 37:43.755
If you're curious about that,
you can ask your father.

37:45.725 --> 37:50.101
The reason I took Lee Yoon Sung
and raised him...

37:50.188 --> 37:55.295
It's all in the classified documents you're
working so hard to find. Go search for it.

37:55.525 --> 38:01.255
Furthermore, in that document,
you'll discover your father's vile side.

38:03.215 --> 38:05.450
If a person is murdered or assaulted,

38:05.451 --> 38:10.822
it's the prosecutor's responsibility
to bring the culprit to trial.

38:11.005 --> 38:15.120
But the truth is,
the motherland murdered 20 men.

38:15.121 --> 38:20.522
And that motherland
wiped out all evidence of their existence.

38:23.005 --> 38:27.304
My revenge is aimed at the nation
that tried to cover up the truth,

38:27.305 --> 38:30.595
you think that's just a bloody revenge?

38:31.105 --> 38:34.374
The nation we swore to guard with our lives
and trusted in,

38:34.375 --> 38:35.683
the way it silently obliterated 20 lives,

38:35.684 --> 38:38.925
and then completely buried the truth,
uncover it!

38:40.695 --> 38:42.844
As for those bastards in power,

38:42.845 --> 38:45.224
who claimed they did it for the nation,
uncover the crimes they actually committed

38:45.225 --> 38:48.035
and the vile things your father did!

38:50.535 --> 38:52.495
I will uncover it.

38:54.375 --> 38:58.944
As for you, I will make sure
you'll be judged by the law too.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.394
I'm ready for it.

39:00.395 --> 39:05.354
But you'll have to bring the nation to trial
too.

39:05.355 --> 39:09.755
If the nation committed a crime,
then it too will be brought to trial.

39:10.995 --> 39:13.315
Of course my father will be as well...

39:17.265 --> 39:21.715
I hope next time,
we'll meet as prosecutor and criminal...

39:22.675 --> 39:24.555
in court.

39:40.385 --> 39:43.265
<i>Chairman Chun, you're quite impressive.</i>

39:46.725 --> 39:49.824
Yoon Sung, what are you doing?
You haven't eaten anything all day.

39:49.825 --> 39:53.375
You just keep listening to
Chairman Chun's voice over and over again.

39:54.905 --> 39:57.814
Hey Yoon Sung, what are we going to do
with Suk Doo Shik?

39:57.815 --> 39:59.784
I have to feed him 3 times a day.

39:59.785 --> 40:01.504
I have to take him to the bathroom
once or twice a day,

40:01.505 --> 40:02.584
and I have to read to him.

40:02.585 --> 40:05.535
I can't do anything because of him.

40:06.085 --> 40:07.773
He said he wants to turn himself in,

40:07.774 --> 40:10.652
but he knows your face, so it's not
a good idea to let him turn himself in.

40:11.065 --> 40:15.554
What should we do? I don't know
what I should do Yoon Sung.

40:15.555 --> 40:17.634
Yoon Sung, what do we do with Suk Doo Shik?

40:17.635 --> 40:20.205
Stop it already!
I can't hear it!

40:22.955 --> 40:24.694
I have to catch Chairman Chun.

40:24.695 --> 40:27.504
I'm going crazy because
I don't know where he's hiding.

40:27.505 --> 40:31.865
I have to find the classified documents,
I have to find it and verify something.

40:31.885 --> 40:33.951
Ye... Yeah, Yoon Sung.

40:33.955 --> 40:38.915
I was just worried
because you haven't eaten anything.

40:44.635 --> 40:46.415
I'm sorry, Ahjussi.

40:47.385 --> 40:48.744
I'm just a little on edge.

40:48.745 --> 40:51.754
No, no, Punk.
I'm the one who's sorry.

40:51.755 --> 40:55.655
Eat and then work.
I'll leave.

41:14.195 --> 41:17.784
We made a deal with the owner of the junk
yard and he's letting us use it for now.

41:17.785 --> 41:19.945
Change of plans...

41:21.835 --> 41:26.785
At the airport, I sent something
to Kim Young Joo's house by mail.

41:26.845 --> 41:28.204
Go get it back.

41:28.205 --> 41:29.985
Yes.

41:31.385 --> 41:33.495
I'm Chun Jae Man.

41:35.205 --> 41:37.605
I'm absolutely not going down by myself.

41:39.585 --> 41:42.455
Will the stubborn man,

41:43.445 --> 41:45.909
or the strong man live?

41:46.550 --> 41:48.370
Let's find out.

41:52.675 --> 41:55.255
Yes, did you find the jacket you left?

41:55.285 --> 41:58.245
I left it on the sofa
so you can find it easily.

41:58.725 --> 42:02.265
Yeah...
What is there to be thankful for?

42:02.535 --> 42:07.914
Sae Hee, if you're not busy,
do you want to eat together?

42:07.915 --> 42:11.575
I'm not busy, where are you?

42:14.345 --> 42:16.754
Oh, you're almost here.

42:16.755 --> 42:18.865
Then I'll wait.

42:22.945 --> 42:24.795
Who is it?

42:33.765 --> 42:35.605
Who is it?

42:54.335 --> 42:56.245
You have a delivery.

42:56.965 --> 43:00.395
Young Joo, you have a delivery.

43:00.845 --> 43:03.114
I'll sign for it for you.

43:03.115 --> 43:04.914
Should I sign it?

43:04.915 --> 43:07.255
I don't know who it's from.

43:08.175 --> 43:10.865
There's no sender's name.

43:11.525 --> 43:15.485
Open it?
Okay, hold on.

43:22.226 --> 43:25.786
[Classified Documents,
classified until 2030]

43:26.765 --> 43:29.931
Classified Documents, classified until 2030.

43:29.932 --> 43:31.878
<i>That's what the cover says.</i>

43:31.995 --> 43:33.705
Classified Documents?

43:34.005 --> 43:36.814
Okay, I'm coming right now
so hold onto it carefully.

43:36.815 --> 43:38.284
Okay, hurry up and come.

43:38.285 --> 43:40.665
I'll just leave it right here.

43:48.415 --> 43:50.074
Who is it?

43:50.075 --> 43:53.824
<i>There was a gas leak report
so we came for an inspection.</i>

43:53.825 --> 43:56.065
Gas leak?

44:10.535 --> 44:12.055
Who are you?

44:17.205 --> 44:21.945
Do you guys know that this is called
trespassing on private property?

44:23.275 --> 44:27.855
This is Seoul District Prosecutor's Office's
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo's home.

44:30.565 --> 44:32.985
This package was delivered to my husband.

44:33.215 --> 44:37.045
If you want to take it, then
you have to get his permission to do so.

44:38.655 --> 44:39.534
Do you want to die?

44:39.535 --> 44:44.385
Do you think you'll get away
with killing a prosecutor's wife?

44:50.175 --> 44:52.555
Hey, Prosecutor's Wife.

44:53.325 --> 44:58.085
If we're afraid of dying
we can't do this kind of work.

44:58.775 --> 45:00.325
Take care of her.

45:01.325 --> 45:04.554
Let go, let go. Let go.

45:04.555 --> 45:07.015
Let me go.

45:09.955 --> 45:11.755
You did well.

45:27.035 --> 45:28.705
Sae Hee.

45:31.395 --> 45:32.975
Sae Hee?

45:37.285 --> 45:39.055
Sae Hee.

45:41.015 --> 45:42.775
Jin Sae Hee.

45:49.665 --> 45:51.295
Sae Hee!

45:52.435 --> 45:54.015
Sae Hee.

45:55.275 --> 45:57.135
Sae Hee, are you okay?

46:01.025 --> 46:02.965
Young Joo...

46:03.025 --> 46:06.294
It's fine.
It's fine now, Sae Hee.

46:06.295 --> 46:10.925
Those guys took it,
the classified documents.

46:12.275 --> 46:14.555
Hurry up and go.

46:21.275 --> 46:24.915
I'm sorry, for dragging you into this.

46:30.095 --> 46:32.975
<i>Chairman Chun, you're quite impressive.</i>

46:35.865 --> 46:37.654
<i>You must be in a noisy place.</i>

46:37.655 --> 46:42.985
<i>I have the files
classified as top secret until 2030.</i>

46:43.315 --> 46:46.005
<i>If you stop chasing after me,</i>

46:46.465 --> 46:49.014
<i>- That's it...
- I'll hand them over to you.</i>

46:49.015 --> 46:50.342
<i>- That sound...
- Forget it.</i>

46:50.343 --> 46:52.226
<i>- It's a car junk yard.
- I'll look for it myself.</i>

46:52.255 --> 46:53.331
<i>The classified documents and you too,</i>

46:53.332 --> 46:55.163
<i>- Yeah, it's a junk yard.
- Chairman Chun.</i>

46:55.198 --> 46:57.315
<i>You impertinent boy...</i>

46:59.655 --> 47:03.414
<i>The City Hunter once again delivered
Chairman Chun to the Prosecutor's Office.</i>

47:03.415 --> 47:05.425
<i>Chairman Chun was...</i>

47:07.434 --> 47:09.334
He must have

47:09.335 --> 47:12.415
hid inside the car that was being sent
to the junk yard and escaped.

47:12.417 --> 47:15.564
- Tell me what was I supposed to do?
- You're really something!

47:15.565 --> 47:17.301
You're the one who slammed on the breaks!

47:17.345 --> 47:20.024
- So I had to swerve in that direction!
- That side is narrow.

47:20.025 --> 47:22.104
Why did you swerve that way?!

47:22.105 --> 47:24.705
You're completely unreasonable!
This is unbelievable!

47:31.285 --> 47:34.255
Seoul, 32 Mo 5987.

47:40.095 --> 47:42.977
This car is registered in Seocho-gu,

47:42.978 --> 47:46.363
so it was sent to the Seoul car junkyard.

47:48.405 --> 47:51.054
I was just a little shocked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

47:51.055 --> 47:53.385
So go and do you work, Young Joo.

47:54.355 --> 47:57.115
You were like that
when we lived together too.

47:57.715 --> 48:01.074
You'd say you were okay
and tell me to go work.

48:01.075 --> 48:03.104
Do you think I don't know Kim Young Joo?

48:03.105 --> 48:07.455
I can tell just by your face,
how can I hold you back?

48:08.425 --> 48:11.505
That is what's attractive about you as well.

48:14.035 --> 48:16.005
I'm sorry, Sae Hee.

48:17.275 --> 48:19.235
Your apology,

48:21.575 --> 48:25.515
if I give you another chance
to make it up to me, will you do a good job?

48:27.335 --> 48:29.185
I want to do that.

48:29.235 --> 48:33.095
I'm happy that you're here
watching over me,

48:33.605 --> 48:39.535
and I want to see you go to work
with a nicely ironed shirt.

48:43.895 --> 48:46.195
Yes, Chairman, we found it.

48:46.255 --> 48:50.664
Prosecutor Kim wasn't there,
but his wife was there.

48:50.665 --> 48:52.774
There was a small mishap.

48:52.775 --> 48:54.505
Come back first.

48:57.985 --> 49:00.775
I'll take care of the president later.

49:02.025 --> 49:05.125
I have to get rid of that City Hunter first.

49:06.945 --> 49:08.665
Lee Jin Pyo,

49:10.075 --> 49:13.925
you should have died
in the waters of Nampo that day.

49:31.695 --> 49:34.615
There's not much left, Moo Yul.

49:43.225 --> 49:49.005
<i>If you want the classified documents, come
to the Seoul car junk yard. Chun Jae Man.</i>

49:53.205 --> 49:57.375
[ If you want the classified documents,
come to the Seoul junk yard. City Hunter. ]

49:59.575 --> 50:01.555
City Hunter.

50:04.565 --> 50:06.434
You have to leave, right?

50:06.435 --> 50:10.605
See, you have no poker face.

50:10.715 --> 50:13.725
Your face says it all, Young Joo.

50:14.125 --> 50:15.004
Sae Hee...

50:15.005 --> 50:18.515
Don't worry, this is the hospital.

50:18.545 --> 50:22.175
I'll take a nap while getting the IV fluids
until you come back.

50:30.325 --> 50:32.345
You said you'd give me another chance,

50:36.155 --> 50:38.065
that's a promise.

50:41.795 --> 50:45.055
Don't you forget this promise.

50:45.505 --> 50:49.025
Let's talk when I come back,
I'll come back soon.

51:31.775 --> 51:34.105
Ajumeoni, I'm here.

51:34.875 --> 51:36.314
It's been a while.

51:36.315 --> 51:38.344
Have you been well?

51:38.345 --> 51:41.724
Have you seen Yoon Sung?

51:41.725 --> 51:44.814
Yes, I saw him outside the Security Office
just now.

51:44.815 --> 51:47.185
Did anything seem odd?

51:47.745 --> 51:51.035
Why?
Did something happen?

51:53.925 --> 51:56.124
No... no.

51:56.125 --> 51:57.855
Ajumeoni...

52:00.015 --> 52:02.725
The handkerchief you gave me,

52:03.765 --> 52:07.305
the president has the same one.

52:10.065 --> 52:15.685
Can't you tell me what's going on?

52:18.835 --> 52:20.585
The truth is,

52:20.815 --> 52:26.815
I told Lee Yoon Sung
that the president was looking for you.

52:30.845 --> 52:33.075
It was because I was worried about you.

52:33.325 --> 52:36.555
Whether what I'm suspecting right now
is true,

52:37.865 --> 52:39.775
please tell me.

54:21.365 --> 54:23.436
I called Lee Jin Pyo
but he hasn't come.

54:23.437 --> 54:27.335
Kim Young Joo,
how did you know to come here?

54:29.085 --> 54:31.514
Did you come for the classified documents?

54:31.515 --> 54:32.844
Stubborn bastard...

54:32.845 --> 54:34.464
Where are the classified documents?

54:34.465 --> 54:36.225
What do we do?

54:37.225 --> 54:40.985
It's about to disappear with that car
that's being crushed.

54:43.145 --> 54:47.145
That... I can't give it to you anymore.

54:48.375 --> 54:51.285
I took it back because I need to use it.

54:52.225 --> 54:53.704
Grab him!

54:53.705 --> 54:55.968
Hey, Punk!

54:59.270 --> 55:00.474
Grab him!

56:36.545 --> 56:40.485
Do you think you have two lives?

56:45.535 --> 56:47.375
City Hunter...

57:10.335 --> 57:11.755
Go take a look.

57:34.275 --> 57:36.965
<i>The Classified Documents
are in the car crusher at the junkyard.</i>

57:46.305 --> 57:51.715
You guys can't move one step from here.

57:52.115 --> 57:54.855
If you want to die, try me.

59:39.345 --> 59:41.875
You stubborn bastard...

59:47.235 --> 59:49.594
You'd be better off
if you were like your father.

59:49.595 --> 59:52.524
You can't get away.

59:52.525 --> 59:54.765
That's your wish,

59:54.845 --> 59:58.245
but my boat has already arrived
at Hwaseong Port.

59:58.855 --> 01:00:02.604
If the skies are blocked, then we have
to make an opening in the ocean.

01:00:02.605 --> 01:00:05.084
Can you stop me in your current condition?

01:00:05.085 --> 01:00:07.825
Do you have any final words?

01:00:08.155 --> 01:00:09.955
Say it!

01:00:12.215 --> 01:00:13.955
Chun Jae Man,

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:16.983
for your crimes

01:00:17.184 --> 01:00:22.984
of professional negligence, fraud,
tax evasion, and contract killing,

01:00:23.198 --> 01:00:29.798
I, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo,
Seoul District Prosecutor's Office,

01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:32.616
will ensure you, Chun Jae Man,

01:00:32.651 --> 01:00:38.148
receive the maximum sentence
of 22 years and 6 months.

01:01:33.275 --> 01:01:35.865
Hey, go.

01:02:09.235 --> 01:02:12.455
Kim Young Joo...
Kim Young Joo, are you okay?

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.295
Pull yourself together.

01:02:22.445 --> 01:02:24.615
D... Did you find it?

01:02:26.255 --> 01:02:28.735
Yeah, I found it.

01:02:30.075 --> 01:02:34.025
Use... the classified documents...

01:02:35.235 --> 01:02:42.475
to uncover how the nation
duped its citizens...

01:02:43.785 --> 01:02:47.225
Stop talking.
It's hard for you right now.

01:02:51.875 --> 01:02:56.758
Chun Jae Man...
is going to Hwaseong Port.

01:02:57.788 --> 01:02:59.545
Hurry and catch him.

01:03:01.985 --> 01:03:03.315
I...

01:03:04.745 --> 01:03:07.145
don't think I can go right now.

01:03:07.515 --> 01:03:09.195
Kim Young Joo...

01:03:10.325 --> 01:03:12.665
You catch him with your own hands.

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:26.885
Ci... City Hunter,

01:03:31.505 --> 01:03:33.135
Lee Yoon Sung,

01:03:34.675 --> 01:03:40.125
please forgive my father.

01:03:44.635 --> 01:03:46.325
I'm sorry.

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:02.875
Kim Young Joo...

01:04:03.525 --> 01:04:05.225
Kim Young Joo...

01:04:06.335 --> 01:04:07.894
Kim Young Joo!

01:04:23.543 --> 01:04:28.685
<i>I told myself I'd be fine alone,</i>

01:04:28.855 --> 01:04:34.293
<i>that I'd do just as well without you.</i>

01:04:34.363 --> 01:04:39.747
<i>Resolutely, I wish every night
for sleep that won't come.</i>

01:04:39.817 --> 01:04:44.791
<i>But your voice, your expressions
emerge ever more clearly.</i>

01:04:44.861 --> 01:04:50.001
<i>Please tell me now,
what did I do wrong?</i>

01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:52.712
<i>Please tell me now...</i>
