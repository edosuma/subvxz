WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.810
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.579
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.580
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.348
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:14.382 --> 00:17.185
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:17.218 --> 00:20.054
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.390
Previously on
Jane by Design...

00:22.423 --> 00:24.792
Nick and I had this moment
at the dance where something
might've happened between us.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.594
You know, something real.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.796
And now
it's just gone.

00:28.829 --> 00:29.763
He hasn't spoken to me once
since that dance.

00:29.797 --> 00:33.101
It's just I'm having
these feelings about...

00:33.134 --> 00:34.802
OkYeah?en?

00:34.835 --> 00:37.605
Ben, I'm not your counselor,
or your therapist.
I have work to do.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.373
GRAY: Your office hours
are part time

00:39.407 --> 00:41.309
because my work
keeps me on the road.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.444
But make no mistake
about it.
I expect perfection.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.614
I was thinking you and I
should go on a proper date
though, yeah?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.216
Mmm, I don't think so.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.617
I demand
an explanation.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.486
I guess I'm in
a buy American
sort of mood.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.422
Jane Quimby, you are
breaking my heart.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.190
(LAUGHS) Hardly.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.825
I miss you.
I screwed up
everything, Billy,

00:57.858 --> 00:58.892
and I'm so sorry.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.529
I just wanna be with you.
I don't care who knows.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.464
I just wish you'd
give me another...

01:08.502 --> 01:09.470
I have to tell Jane.

01:14.642 --> 01:18.112
JANE:
When we look back
at the iconic styles

01:18.146 --> 01:19.280
that have defined
entire decades,

01:19.313 --> 01:21.515
we all have
a similar reaction.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.683
We cringe.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.953
That cute outfit
you love today

01:25.986 --> 01:29.890
will ultimately be
the victim of
three little words,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.892
"Out of style."

01:31.925 --> 01:35.529
So how do the truly
great designers
stay relevant?

01:36.564 --> 01:38.532
They keep us guessing.

01:38.566 --> 01:39.700
They keep us surprised.

01:48.342 --> 01:53.147
* I've my heart where
my head should be

01:53.181 --> 01:55.449
* Light up the rest of me

01:55.483 --> 02:00.188
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

02:00.221 --> 02:00.954
* Through the stops,
the starts

02:00.988 --> 02:04.458
* And life is a work of art

02:11.665 --> 02:13.634
Don't say it.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.502
Don't say what?

02:14.535 --> 02:15.603
I already know
what you're gonna say.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.539
I highly doubt that.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.375
You want to complain
about your recent demotion
to back seat status.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.411
But I have good news.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.513
Ben is driving
himself to
school today.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.282
So, you are back
in the front seat
where you belong.

02:28.316 --> 02:31.719
That's great, Jane,
but there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.521
So serious.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.722
Yeah, I kinda...

02:34.755 --> 02:36.690
Look, I don't know
how to say this,

02:36.724 --> 02:39.293
so I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.
I've been seeing...

02:39.327 --> 02:40.728
It's Gray. Hang on.)

02:41.762 --> 02:43.331
Good morning, Gray.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.632
GRAY:
I'm in London, Jane.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.666
Not morning.

02:45.699 --> 02:46.133
Oh, right.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.303
Close enough.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.339
I need to prep you
on Miyoko Sato.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.673
Are you familiar
with her?

02:52.706 --> 02:55.276
Of course.
Editor in Chief of
Modern Empress.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.644
Japan's premier
fashion magazine.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.747
And she'll be
in the office today to
review our new collection.

02:59.780 --> 03:00.948
Do you know how
many times

03:00.981 --> 03:03.684
Donovan Decker has been
featured in Modern Empress?

03:03.717 --> 03:06.387
Never. Not once.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.456
This is a very
important meeting, Jane.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.658
Whatever the woman wants,
you get it for her.
Understood?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.693
Yes.
I'll keep her happy.

03:12.726 --> 03:16.564
Miyoko Sato is
incapable of emotions
like happiness.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.967
Imagine the most
difficult, demanding person
you've ever met.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.235
Can you do that?

03:21.635 --> 03:24.004
I think I can.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.375
After today,
that person will fall to
number two on your list.

03:27.408 --> 03:30.244
Likes, dislikes,
allergies, hobbies,
habits.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.745
I think I've
got it all.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.647
I'm depending
on you, Jane.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.317
If we don't make it
into Modern Empress
this year,

03:36.350 --> 03:38.452
Donovan's gonna make
some major changes
at the top.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.654
And I would like
I understand. .

03:40.688 --> 03:42.456
Yo I sure hope so. me.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.759
So, about what I
wanted to tell you.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.561
Ugh! Don't turn around.
Incoming.

03:50.298 --> 03:50.531
Okay, Janey,
here's the deal...

03:50.564 --> 03:52.633
Hi.

03:52.666 --> 03:53.301
Can we help you?

03:55.035 --> 03:56.404
What do you want, Lulu?

03:57.037 --> 03:57.805
Just this.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.609
I can explain.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.277
You can explain?

04:06.314 --> 04:08.282
This is
not happening.

04:08.316 --> 04:12.286
No, Janey, wait...
No. Please!

04:12.320 --> 04:13.253
Oh, you didn't
tell her yet?

04:14.522 --> 04:15.656
Sorry.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.570
Go away.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.338
Not until
you talk to me.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.675
How long?

04:36.510 --> 04:39.547
You want to talk,
then let's talk, Billy.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.748
How long has this,

04:40.781 --> 04:42.483
whatever it is,
been going on?

04:44.485 --> 04:45.453
I've been dating Lulu
for a few months.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.759
You've been
doing Lulu for
a few months?

04:51.792 --> 04:52.893
I said dating.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.464
I read
between the lines.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.642
(BELL RINGING)

05:13.647 --> 05:15.683
Mr. Nutter.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.785
That sound you just heard
was your cue to sit down.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.121
Thank you.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.424
Okay, people.
Wuthering Heights.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.427
Emily Bronte's first
and only novel.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.497
I'm sure everyone here
read it cover to cover.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.432
(STUDENTS GROAN)

05:31.465 --> 05:33.934
Wow. I can feel
the excitement
in the room.

05:35.168 --> 05:35.469
So, thoughts?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.673
It's okay.
Feel free to
jump right in.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.709
Nothing? Okay.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.778
Harper.
What did you think?

05:44.812 --> 05:48.949
I started reading it,
but then it got super boring
so I kinda stopped reading it.

05:51.419 --> 05:54.688
Okay.
Did anyone
keep reading it?

05:56.524 --> 05:58.926
It's about betrayal.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.395
That's an interesting
interpretation, Jane.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.796
Can you give us
an example?

06:02.830 --> 06:05.799
The two main characters,
Heathcliff and Catherine,

06:05.833 --> 06:06.534
are friends
from childhood

06:06.567 --> 06:07.601
who tell
each other everything.

06:07.635 --> 06:10.938
MR. HUNTER:
What ultimately
drove them apart?

06:10.971 --> 06:14.642
Well, one day
out of the blue,

06:14.675 --> 06:16.810
Heathcliff just decided to
stab Catherine in the back.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.947
I don't remember
that chapter.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.850
The theme of the book
is forgiveness.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.418
I'd argue that it's
more the
consequences of...

06:24.452 --> 06:27.821
It's about recognizing
that people make mistakes.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.424
And by mistake,
what I meant was

06:30.458 --> 06:31.659
the chapter where
the guy character

06:31.692 --> 06:33.160
doesn't tell his
best friend the truth
about everything.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.829
He regrets that.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.432
JANE: Well, none of that
matters in the end,

06:38.466 --> 06:41.835
because it's obvious
their entire friendship
was nothing but a lie.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.003
That's not true.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.175
Right. Okay.

06:48.208 --> 06:52.580
I'm not sure which
CliffsNotes version
you two read, but...

06:54.748 --> 06:55.816
Let's move on.
Shall we?

06:55.849 --> 06:56.016
Great.

07:01.855 --> 07:02.523
Hey, Coach,
you wanted to see me?

07:02.556 --> 07:05.493
Nick. My man.
Come on in.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.630
Check it out.
Pretty impressive, huh?

07:09.663 --> 07:10.831
Is tYeah. Numero 15.sey?

07:10.864 --> 07:13.200
Don't worry.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.469
You keep doing
what you're doing,

07:15.503 --> 07:16.670
they might retire your jersey
and hang it
on one of these walls.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.838
I didn't know they
retired your jersey.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.507
Well, they didn't
exactly retire it.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.608
Doesn't Sanders
wear 15?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.710
Yeah,
I'm working on it.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.745
Look, I wanted to talk
to you about Wrightsville
coming up next week.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.813
It's a big game for us.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.615
Yeah.
They're pretty good.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.949
They're really good.
But we're better.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.218
As long as the team
has your full focus.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.587
Where else would
my focus be?

07:33.621 --> 07:36.557
You seemed
pretty distracted at
practice yesterday.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.627
And we're moving into
the toughest stretch
of the season.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.261
I just wanna check in,
check your head.
Make sure everything was okay.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.898
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.668
Actually, I've kinda had
a lot on my mind lately.

07:47.701 --> 07:47.968
Mind if I sit?

07:48.001 --> 07:50.003
Thanks.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.539
No. Go ahead.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.540
It's just...

07:53.040 --> 07:54.508
I don't know.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.509
I've been feeling
this pressure

07:55.543 --> 07:59.647
from my parents,
my friends,
my teammates.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.782
It's just...

08:01.815 --> 08:05.519
I don't know.
It's hard to live up to
those expectations.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.920
I don't know,
I was thinking
maybe I should...

08:06.954 --> 08:08.622
No.
Hold that thought.
Follow me.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.724
WherNot far.ng?

08:12.292 --> 08:12.826
This one's for you.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.796
BSee you at practice.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.069
They don't bite.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.804
Well, I heard
Harper does,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.305
but apparently
guys like that.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.874
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

08:26.907 --> 08:28.642
HeyHey.ys.

08:28.676 --> 08:28.909
You all know Billy.
Right?

08:28.942 --> 08:30.978
Hey.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.846
So are you guys like
officially official?

08:32.880 --> 08:35.716
Uh, I guess.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.685
We didn't sign anything.

08:37.718 --> 08:38.586
You look familiar.
How do I know you?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.555
Really, Cam?

08:41.589 --> 08:43.657
Billy's been
going to school with us
since the third grade.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.058
We were
lab partners once.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.927
We dissected a frog.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.862
I remember
you enjoyed it.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.964
Probably a little more
than you should've.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.966
No. That's not it.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.868
Oh, wait.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.104
Did your brother steal
my brother's car
a few years ago?

08:57.137 --> 08:58.105
(AWKWARDLY)
Mmm-hmm. Probably.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.641
Sorry about that.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.886
Go ahead.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.060
Did you guys
just break up?

09:25.833 --> 09:26.800
Janey!

09:30.904 --> 09:31.905
I'm sorry.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.907
You're sorry?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.009
For which part?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.778
I should've
told you the truth.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.112
But I wanted to.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.882
We just...

09:41.915 --> 09:43.851
We didn't know
what it was at first.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.919
We?
Who, you and Lulu?

09:45.953 --> 09:49.690
God! Do you have any idea
how ridiculous that sounds?

09:49.723 --> 09:50.490
See? That's why I
couldn't tell you.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.893
I knew you wouldn't
understand.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.094
You never gave me
a chance to understand.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.764
And now it's too late.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.166
Don't say that.
All right?
I'm gonna fix this.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.801
I just want you
to leave me alone.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.972
I can't do this
without you, Janey.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.039
Do what?

10:06.073 --> 10:10.043
This. All of it.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.646
I'm sure you'll be fine.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.382
Besides, you have a seat
at the popular table now.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.750
Come on.
You know me.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.219
I thought I did.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.200
It's here.
T-minus three minutes.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.202
Take cover.
I'll absorb
the first attack.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.236
Good luck.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.041
Miyoko Sato?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.843
Shh. Don't say
the name out loud.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.812
(CWhat?ES)

10:44.845 --> 10:46.446
Well, I've just never
seen you nervous.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.816
I mean,
Miyoko can't be
that bad, can she?

10:48.849 --> 10:51.184
Jane.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.420
This woman holds
this company's future
in the palm of her hand.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.221
Donovan Decker told me
that getting into
Modern Empress this year

10:54.254 --> 10:56.223
is our highest priority.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.826
You spoke to Donovan?

10:58.859 --> 11:01.995
Well, not directly.
It was in a memo...

11:03.263 --> 11:05.165
to Gray.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.167
The truth is
I've never actually
met Donovan Decker.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.135
Seriously?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.237
Could we just focus
on Miyoko Sato? Okay?

11:10.270 --> 11:12.239
She is vicious.
She is cruel.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.041
And she is
impossible to please
and...

11:14.074 --> 11:15.175
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

11:21.214 --> 11:24.952
(IN JAPANESE)

11:29.757 --> 11:32.125
I speak English.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.861
Of course you do.
I was just...

11:33.894 --> 11:36.063
Trying to impress me.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.867
I don't respond to charm.
I find it quite irritating.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.501
Fair enough. Yeah.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.471
Welcome to Donovan Decker.

11:44.504 --> 11:44.972
Let me give you
the grand tour.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.040
I've seen enough.

11:48.776 --> 11:51.845
I hope not, because...

11:51.879 --> 11:53.013
We have an incredible
new collection
to show you...

11:53.046 --> 11:55.015
It can wait.

11:55.048 --> 11:59.119
First I need an office,
a phone,
and some privacy.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.321
Of course.
We just need to find you
a suitable...

12:02.923 --> 12:04.792
Actually,
Gray is out of town.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.860
I suppose you could
use her office. Jane?

12:06.894 --> 12:08.228
Um. I'm not sure
that Gray would...

12:09.562 --> 12:11.765
mind at all.

12:11.799 --> 12:12.800
Right this way.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.804
MiyoI'm Jane.is...

12:16.837 --> 12:18.839
This is Jane.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.207
Whatever you need today,
just ask me
and I'll take care of it.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.775
Whatever you need today,
just ask her and
she will take care of it.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.877
Are you heNo.ranslator?

12:23.911 --> 12:24.444
No.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.780
I want you to go away.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.315
And I want you to
get me some food.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.117
Of course.
What would you like?

12:30.150 --> 12:33.153
Something vegan,

12:33.186 --> 12:35.255
but I don't want it
to be too vegan.
That's boring.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.957
Get me something

12:37.557 --> 12:38.358
half vegan.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.329
I'm not sure what
half vegan means.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.969
(LAUGHS)
She's kidding.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.270
That sounds delicious.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.106
Why are you
still here?

12:56.043 --> 12:58.078
Half vegan?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.579
What is half vegan?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.581
I was hoping
you'd know.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.083
Yeah.
I don't think
that exists.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.819
Can I see a menu?

13:05.853 --> 13:06.786
Yeah.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.025
Secret sauce?
What's in that?

13:12.059 --> 13:13.593
It's a secret.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.395
Um, is it fully vegan?

13:17.264 --> 13:18.832
Just give me
some of that.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.834
So, no food?

13:20.868 --> 13:22.102
No. Just the sauce.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.071
And I'll get something
a little less vegan
on the way back.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.607
We don't sell
just the sauce.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.243
Okay.
How about this.

13:30.277 --> 13:34.047
Just give me an order
of whatever it is that
you put that sauce on,

13:34.081 --> 13:36.884
and then instead of
pouring it on the food,
pour it in a To-Go cup.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.386
So, no food?

13:40.954 --> 13:41.855
(SIGHS)

13:56.269 --> 13:57.437
DI improvised.t?

14:02.175 --> 14:05.012
What took you
so long?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.280
There was a long line
at the half vegan restaurant.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.316
People love this stuff.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.132
Enjoy.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.201
I'm ready to see
the collection now.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.081
Predictable.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.184
Derivative.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.388
No comment necessary.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.158
And this is

14:51.191 --> 14:53.093
priceless.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.064
Meaning there is
no price
I would pay for it.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.067
Okay then,
are we done here?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.069
Actually, no.
There is one more.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.104
We saved
the best for last.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.438
That's not
saying much.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.507
Right.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.010
Well, this is a design
I'm particularly proud of,

15:10.043 --> 15:13.046
and I think it
would look perfect

15:13.080 --> 15:13.446
on the cover of
Modern Empress.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.254
(IN JAPANESE)

15:24.357 --> 15:25.959
What did she say?

15:25.993 --> 15:26.994
(REPEATS JAPANESE)

15:27.760 --> 15:28.996
What does that mean?

15:30.397 --> 15:32.065
Best of luck next year.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.238
(SIGHS)

15:49.182 --> 15:50.350
Say it.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.052
What?

15:52.085 --> 15:52.552
It's obvious
something is
on your mind.

15:57.190 --> 16:01.261
I respect your opinion.
I really, really do.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.433
But I think
this collection is
something new.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.000
It's different.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.304
And?

16:12.239 --> 16:13.306
And...

16:13.340 --> 16:15.442
it's just...

16:16.309 --> 16:19.479
Donovan Decker took risks
with this collection.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.049
They didn't play it safe.

16:22.082 --> 16:25.452
And isn't that what
we should be looking
for in fashion?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.454
To be surprised?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.760
I'm sorry.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.428
That's all I
wanted to say.

16:44.604 --> 16:48.141
Tell Jeremy to meet
me tomorrow night at
La Petite Grenouille.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.076
8:30.

16:50.610 --> 16:54.214
And remind him to
leave his irritating charm
at home.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.128
Honest opinion.
How does this look?

17:12.532 --> 17:14.201
Do I even want to ask?

17:14.234 --> 17:15.468
I just told you to
steal base.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.471
Working on some new
hand signals for the game
next week.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.839
Check it out.
Check it out.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.374
Ben, I'm really tired.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.545
See the difference?
It was subtle.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.347
That's great.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.618
Wanna talk about it?

17:31.651 --> 17:32.385
Talk about what?

17:32.419 --> 17:37.257
The new "It" couple
in school?

17:37.290 --> 17:39.192
You heard about
Billy and Lulu?

17:39.226 --> 17:41.294
Of course I did.
I'm dialed in.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.330
So you overheard it
somewhere.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.297
Yeah.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.103
He lied to me
for months.

17:50.137 --> 17:50.803
He's in high school.
He likes a girl.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.340
Please don't
take his side.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.342
I'm not taking sides.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.309
I know how important
Billy is to you.

17:56.343 --> 17:59.512
And I know
how important
you are to him.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.080
You'll get through it.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.318
I appreciate
you trying, Ben.

18:05.352 --> 18:09.122
But you have no idea what
my life is like right now.

18:09.156 --> 18:12.559
I mean, my best friend
is secretly dating a girl

18:12.592 --> 18:15.262
that's made my life hell
since middle school.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.265
And to top it all off
the guy I have
a major crush on

18:18.298 --> 18:19.599
hasn't spoken to me
in over a week.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.169
And who might that be?

18:24.671 --> 18:27.607
It doesn't matter.
He obviously hates me.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.144
Look, Janey.
I understand.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.312
You might think I don't,

18:32.345 --> 18:34.581
but it wasn't that long ago
that I was in high school.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.450
But it's different.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.719
You were the star jock,
not the girl pining
for the star jock.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.923
Nick Fadden.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.425
You're talking
about Nick Fadden.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.527
Like I said,
it doesn't matter.

18:47.560 --> 18:47.660
Wait.

18:51.598 --> 18:55.468
You should go to
the baseball field.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.306
Why would I do that?

19:11.218 --> 19:13.586
That was
a solid double.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.288
That was
a home run.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.724
(LAUGHS) No way.
Not enough trajectory.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.261
You think you can
do any better?

19:21.294 --> 19:23.530
As a matter of fact
I don't.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.298
(LAUGHS)

19:25.332 --> 19:27.967
But I'm willing to try.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.370
All right, you're up.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.347
Ooh!

19:40.380 --> 19:42.749
I'm just
warming up here.

19:42.782 --> 19:43.783
I can see that.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.489
Next time,
just a thought,
maybe you should

19:49.522 --> 19:50.690
swing the bat?

19:50.723 --> 19:52.659
Oh. I'll swing
when I'm ready.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.296
Well, good thing
you were ready there.

19:59.766 --> 20:03.703
So, you gonna tell me
why you ditched me
at the dance last week?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.772
You think I
ditched you?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.274
Well, you disappeared.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.309
I came back.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.513
I had to do this thing
for my internship

20:13.546 --> 20:16.549
and I got a little held up,
but I did come back.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.452
You were
already gone.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.423
I'm really sorry
I missed it.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.795
Maybe I could
make it up to you
sometime?

20:28.828 --> 20:31.398
Buy you a coffee
or something?

20:31.431 --> 20:32.365
I'd like that.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.301
Me, too.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.037
What about
tomorrow night?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.806
Tomorrow I can't.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.275
I have practice.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.610
You know,
big game coming up.

20:44.811 --> 20:45.645
Right.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.580
Of course.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.418
I'm gonna
get back out there.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.721
Here.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.792
Widen your stance
a little bit.

20:59.826 --> 21:00.827
Elbow up.

21:02.061 --> 21:02.829
There you go.

21:04.331 --> 21:04.797
A bit higher.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.334
All right.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.469
Now swing away.

21:16.409 --> 21:16.676
Oh!

21:16.709 --> 21:18.711
(LAUGHS)

21:18.745 --> 21:19.812
That was a home run.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.718
You know what?

21:25.752 --> 21:29.356
We should definitely do
that coffee thing soon.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.597
It took me a few pitches,
but I got the hang of it.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.731
You would've been proud.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.401
Apparently I have
a natural swing.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.569
Well, of course.
You're a Quimby.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.572
Nick's a really
good batting coach.

21:45.605 --> 21:48.341
Whoa. Back up.
Batting coach?

21:48.375 --> 21:49.542
Yeah.
He taught me
how to bat.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.643
I taught you how to bat.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.512
When you were six.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.746
I don't remember that.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.715
Wiffle ball?
Backyard?

21:55.748 --> 21:56.583
Jane, I gave you
that swing.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.820
Thank you?

22:00.853 --> 22:03.490
You're the one that
told me to go to
the batting cages.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.358
I was trying to
cheer you up.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.626
Well, it worked.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.902
Can I give you
some brotherly advice?

22:15.935 --> 22:17.470
I'd rather you didn't.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.572
Just go talk to him.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.511
I'll see you later, Ben.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.425
Hey, you weren't
popular in high school.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.860
Are you asking me
or reminding me?

22:40.893 --> 22:41.594
I'm worried
about Jane.

22:41.628 --> 22:44.931
You need to work
on your segues.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.767
She's not the most
popular girl around here.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.403
Maybe she doesn't
buy into the whole
popularity thing?

22:50.437 --> 22:51.938
She's a lot like I was
in high school.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.473
That's what
worries me.

22:53.506 --> 22:54.641
Thanks.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.643
No, no, no.
I didn't mean it like that.
I just...

22:59.479 --> 23:01.714
You must've
hated high school.
Yeah?

23:01.748 --> 23:03.550
I didn't hate it.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.853
But the nicknames
made the experience
unpleasant.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.722
But I wouldn't change it.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.692
All of that
made me stronger.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.826
It made me
who I am today.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.528
And I think I
turned out okay.

23:16.663 --> 23:17.730
You certainly did.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.535
And so will Jane.

23:22.569 --> 23:23.803
Yeah, but what about now?
She's not happy.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.973
It's high school, Ben.
Nobody's happy.

23:31.611 --> 23:31.744
Thanks.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.620
This is my office.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.761
HARPER:
This totally sucks.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.797
I mean, why are we
drawing fruit anyways?

23:50.830 --> 23:52.865
Real artists
don't draw fruit.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.467
What do
real artists draw?

23:54.501 --> 23:55.835
Nudes.

23:55.868 --> 23:56.268
Nudes?

23:56.302 --> 23:58.571
Naked people.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.006
I know what
nude means.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.008
You want them to
bring in a naked guy
for us to draw?

24:02.041 --> 24:03.676
Or a girl.
I don't discriminate.

24:03.710 --> 24:04.977
Because you're
a real artist?

24:05.011 --> 24:07.847
I've been told I
have raw talent.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.585
It's not finished yet.

24:12.619 --> 24:15.688
Seriously.
Hot naked boy
or fruit?

24:15.722 --> 24:17.957
Well, when you
put it that way...

24:17.990 --> 24:19.626
Speaking of hot boys.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.728
Is this thing with Billy
still going on?

24:21.761 --> 24:23.029
It's been
one day, Harper.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.765
So? I've had
shorter hook-ups.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.867
I mean, you do realize
what this means, right?

24:27.900 --> 24:29.869
You and Billy.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.639
Yeah.
It means I have
a boyfriend.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.808
I'm talking about
the social implications
of this hook-up.

24:35.842 --> 24:36.776
Stop calling it
a hook-up.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.912
I'm just saying that
no matter what he does,

24:39.946 --> 24:42.048
he's not going to
be accepted.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.250
Not everyone is
gonna be as
understanding as me.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.719
Thank you for being
so understanding,
Harper.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.589
You're welcome.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.025
I really don't care
what anyone else thinks.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.862
WhWhat about him?ad?

24:55.895 --> 24:56.963
You didn't tell
him yet, did you?

24:56.996 --> 24:58.531
Interesting.

24:58.565 --> 24:59.699
Nothing.

24:59.732 --> 25:00.933
I'm gonna tell him.
I just...

25:00.967 --> 25:02.769
You wanna know
if it sticks.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.804
That's not what I said.

25:04.837 --> 25:05.838
Okay.
Well, let me know
how that goes.

25:09.576 --> 25:09.809
I will.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.096
I miss you, Janey.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.339
She said,
"Better luck next year"?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.575
I think so.

25:42.609 --> 25:43.242
You think so?

25:43.275 --> 25:45.945
She said it
in Japanese.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.947
Did you know
Jeremy spoke Japanese?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.582
I really don't care.

25:49.616 --> 25:50.382
Neither did Ms. Sato.

25:50.416 --> 25:53.686
She said his charm
was irritating.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.355
At least I agree
with her on something.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.124
So that's it then?
It's over?

25:58.157 --> 26:00.727
No.
She and Jeremy are
having dinner tonight.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.428
So there's still hope.

26:02.461 --> 26:05.598
You mean to tell me
the fate of Donovan Decker
getting in Modern Empress

26:05.632 --> 26:06.766
lies with Jeremy and
his irritating charm?

26:09.001 --> 26:13.072
Hello, Gray.
You're looking lovely.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.874
Hello, Jeremy.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.377
Jane tells me you have
an important dinner tonight.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.813
About that.
I was thinking I should take
someone from your department.

26:20.847 --> 26:22.682
Maybe Jane could join me.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.617
She's not
qualified for that.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.018
I disagree.

26:26.052 --> 26:26.886
If it wasn't for Jane,
I wouldn't have this dinner.

26:26.919 --> 26:30.757
Definitely not.
Find someone else.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.660
You're right.
It's probably best if I
take India.

26:33.693 --> 26:33.926
Safe tr Wait! , Gray.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.936
Carter, I need
something to wear.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.905
Sato dinner?
You're eating with it?

26:45.938 --> 26:47.907
A-ha!

26:47.940 --> 26:49.842
Do what you do.

26:49.876 --> 26:51.177
Oh, honey.
I thought you'd
never ask.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.212
(UPBEAT POP MUSIC)

28:02.248 --> 28:05.818
You know, eventually
you're going to
have to pick one.

28:05.852 --> 28:06.018
Oh!

28:11.490 --> 28:13.159
I think I know
the perfect dress.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.144
Beautiful.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.146
It's your design.

28:34.180 --> 28:37.116
Oh, I wasn't talking
about the dress.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.150
But the dress
is beautiful.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.820
Yes, it is.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.488
I hope you don't mind
me wearing it.
I just thought maybe...

28:42.521 --> 28:45.191
No, no, no, no.
It's perfect on you.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.861
So, where's Miyoko?

28:48.895 --> 28:50.897
She's late.
Which is good,

28:50.930 --> 28:52.031
because we should
probably come up
with a strategy

28:52.064 --> 28:52.731
to help eOkay.ther out.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.068
We could use
hand signals.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.269
Hand signals?

28:57.303 --> 28:58.805
Yeah. Like this.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.911
You know, that way we can
tell each other things.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.145
Okay. That'll do.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.781
So if I tug my ear
like this,

29:08.815 --> 29:09.281
you should stop talking.

29:09.315 --> 29:12.919
Okay. Fair enough.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.954
And should we come up
with other signals?

29:14.987 --> 29:17.189
That should do it.

29:17.223 --> 29:20.192
And what if I want
you to stop talking?

29:20.226 --> 29:21.794
If you feel I'm being
a little long winded,
tug away.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.130
Oh, I will.

29:24.163 --> 29:24.296
Here we go.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.936
JEREMY: Hello.vening.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.303
You remember Jane,
don't you?

29:31.337 --> 29:33.005
Hello.
Nice to see you again.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.941
Was that dress
in your collection?

29:34.974 --> 29:36.142
It was.
Good eye.

29:36.175 --> 29:39.078
Don't you love it?

29:39.111 --> 29:42.949
It actually reminds me of
this article in Modern Empress
from a few years ago.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.951
Can I just say
I love your magazine.

29:44.984 --> 29:45.985
It's so inspiring.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.154
I used to cut out
all of my favorite articles.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.824
It reminds me about this one
that how new style can

29:51.858 --> 29:52.825
instantly change
the way that you feel.

29:52.859 --> 29:55.027
And honestly, I don't
remember the last time

29:55.061 --> 29:57.129
I wore a dress that
made me feel so...

29:58.965 --> 30:01.067
Made you feel so what?

30:01.100 --> 30:04.971
So hungry.
Let's eat.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.138
Shall we sit?

30:18.284 --> 30:20.887
This entire menu
is in French.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.989
Yes. We're in
a French restaurant.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.224
I know.
I meant, I can't read it.

30:27.426 --> 30:32.064
(IN FRENCH)

30:38.237 --> 30:38.437
I didn't know
you spoke French.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.274
I wasn't trying
to impress you.

30:42.308 --> 30:45.444
I know.
It's obvious you were
trying to impress her.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.147
Looks like it worked.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.281
The point is that
Donovan Decker is
looking to expand

31:22.314 --> 31:24.450
into the bigger
international markets,

31:24.483 --> 31:27.386
and there's no bigger
platform than
Modern Empress.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.988
And why would I
choose you?

31:29.021 --> 31:32.024
What makes you different
from a hundred
other designers

31:32.058 --> 31:33.692
wanting the exact
same thing?

31:33.725 --> 31:37.363
JEREMY:
Because we're not simply happy
adapting to what's in style.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.033
We're trying to define it.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.206
So, what exactly
did you order?

31:47.239 --> 31:49.075
This would be
the Pate de foie gras.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.143
It'Oh. Okay.acy.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.279
I'll pass.

31:53.312 --> 31:56.983
I prefer not to eat
the intestines of
dirty wetland birds.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.717
Jeremy!
You let me eat a...

31:58.750 --> 32:00.119
It's a delicacy.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.389
Cheers.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.399
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

32:13.432 --> 32:14.000
Come in.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.974
Hey, Ben.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.009
Ah, it's you.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.545
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face
around here.

32:28.314 --> 32:30.149
I'm sorry. Um...

32:31.417 --> 32:34.253
I'm kidding.
I've just always
wanted to say that.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.222
Too soon?

32:36.255 --> 32:38.157
Yeah, maybe
a little too soon.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.526
SheNo.me?

32:40.559 --> 32:43.095
She's got a dinner thing
for the internship.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.132
Rough day, huh?

32:46.165 --> 32:47.399
Yeah. You heard?

32:47.433 --> 32:50.102
Of course I did.
I'm dialed in.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.970
Look, I'm not
taking sides, but...

32:53.305 --> 32:54.473
You should've
told her the truth.

32:54.506 --> 32:57.143
I know.
I know I screwed up.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.510
You did. Big time.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.979
Huge, in fact.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.350
I thought you said
you weren't taking sides.

33:04.383 --> 33:05.751
There's a little bias present.

33:05.784 --> 33:06.585
I'm not gonna lie to you.
She is my little sister.

33:08.054 --> 33:10.322
Yeah, I guess I
deserved it.

33:13.192 --> 33:16.028
(SIGHS)
So, is she doing okay?

33:18.164 --> 33:20.366
She's confused.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.034
You're her best friend
and you lied to her.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.402
She's hurt.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.204
Technically, I never
told her a lie.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.108
Dude, I said technically.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.143
I didn't tell Jane
what was going on
with me and Lulu.

33:31.177 --> 33:31.677
I didn't.

33:31.710 --> 33:35.214
But she never asked.

33:35.247 --> 33:36.348
Technically.

33:36.815 --> 33:40.052
That's a terrible argument.

33:40.086 --> 33:44.256
Quite possibly the worst
argument I've ever heard.

33:44.290 --> 33:47.326
Please tell me that's not
what you were coming over here
to say to Jane.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.195
I don't know
what to say to her.
Okay?

33:49.228 --> 33:52.030
The biggest fight
Jane and I ever had
lasted less than an hour.

33:53.165 --> 33:54.466
I'm nervous, Ben.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.034
I can't lose Janey.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.471
What should I tell her?

34:00.506 --> 34:02.174
Truth?

34:02.208 --> 34:05.144
I tried.
And she said
it was too late.

34:05.177 --> 34:06.412
Little bit of free advice.

34:06.445 --> 34:09.215
I'd lose the whole,
"Technically,
I didn't lie," thing.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.349
The way Jane sees it,
you lied.

34:10.382 --> 34:14.153
For months.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.322
You're the most
important person
in her life.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.089
Aside from me,
of course.

34:18.524 --> 34:19.825
Of course.

34:19.858 --> 34:23.262
You need to try and
look at this thing
from Jane's perspective.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.564
JEREMY: Jane?

34:27.299 --> 34:29.401
Jane?

34:31.537 --> 34:32.871
Jane.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.273
It won't stop
staring at me.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.542
What?

34:36.575 --> 34:38.344
Oh. Sorry.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.546
If you'll excuse me,
I need to use the restroom.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.250
What was that about?

34:44.283 --> 34:46.418
I'm sorry,
but that's just creepy.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.620
And for the record,
the ear tug is
not a mute button.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.459
Sorry.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.626
It's okay.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.096
So then what did you say?

34:58.697 --> 34:59.465
I said I was sorry.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.667
How many times?

35:01.700 --> 35:02.934
What do you mean?

35:02.968 --> 35:06.338
How many times did you
say the actual words,
"I'm sorry"?

35:06.372 --> 35:08.207
Um, just once.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.675
Uh-oh.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.544
You gotta step it up, man.

35:12.578 --> 35:15.681
How many times am I
supposed to say it?

35:15.714 --> 35:16.682
That depends on
the level of offense.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.385
What level am I at?

35:19.418 --> 35:21.520
I'd say you were here.

35:23.422 --> 35:26.692
You're probably looking at
a seven apology offense.

35:26.725 --> 35:29.428
That's a conservative
estimate.
Super conservative.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.697
Give or take maybe eight.
I once...

35:31.730 --> 35:32.731
I once committed
a nine apology offence.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.567
Whoa!

35:35.601 --> 35:36.668
What did you do?

35:37.603 --> 35:40.406
That's not important.

35:40.439 --> 35:44.376
What's important is
you know exactly what you're
going to say going in.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.412
You need six different ways
of saying I'm sorry

35:46.445 --> 35:49.181
in your back pocket
at all times.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.283
(EXHALES)

35:51.317 --> 35:53.319
I think I'm just gonna
give her some time
to cool down.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.654
I don't know,
maybe this is
a mistake, Ben.

36:00.459 --> 36:03.729
You remember
when you were six

36:03.762 --> 36:06.565
and you got that bike,
and you didn't wanna use
the training wheels

36:06.598 --> 36:08.200
'cause your brother said
that was for sissies?

36:09.968 --> 36:11.737
Yeah, I broke my arm.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.639
Who came and got you

36:13.672 --> 36:16.174
and wheeled you
all the way home
in her Radio Flyer?

36:16.775 --> 36:17.576
It was three blocks.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.945
Yeah, and she was five.

36:19.978 --> 36:22.214
Do you know how far that is
in five-year-old blocks?

36:22.248 --> 36:23.415
It's like 28 blocks.

36:25.417 --> 36:25.817
Yeah.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.386
You and Jane,

36:28.654 --> 36:30.622
what you have together,
that's...

36:33.259 --> 36:34.493
It's a friendship
worth saving.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.796
I know.

36:43.269 --> 36:45.504
I'm sorry this dinner's
such a disaster.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.007
It's pretty much
what I expected.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.376
You should've
invited India.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.578
Maybe she wouldn't have
embarrassed you.

36:52.611 --> 36:53.245
You're not
embarrassing me.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.385
She's been gone
a lYeah.ime.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.752
Maybe she ditched us?

37:02.288 --> 37:03.389
You should go
check on her.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.357
Me? Why me?

37:05.391 --> 37:07.025
Because she's in
the ladies room.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.328
And, let's face it,
she hates you a lot less
than she hates me.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.305
Is everything okay?

37:20.806 --> 37:22.574
Yes. I'll be right out.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.048
I'm sorry if I
ruined this dinner.

37:30.081 --> 37:35.521
And I'm even more sorry
if I ruined Donovan Decker's
chances with you.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.589
Sometimes I don't
think before I speak,

37:37.623 --> 37:38.290
and I say
things that...

37:39.625 --> 37:41.727
I don't know.

37:42.561 --> 37:47.733
I just hope that,
maybe not today,

37:47.766 --> 37:48.634
but some time
in the future,

37:48.667 --> 37:50.268
you'll see how great
their designs are.

37:54.673 --> 37:55.774
You know,

37:58.076 --> 37:59.445
you remind me
of myself.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.582
Oh.

38:03.615 --> 38:07.719
I've been consumed
with perfection for
the past few years.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.521
Doing and saying
the right thing.

38:09.788 --> 38:13.325
But there was a time,

38:13.359 --> 38:15.627
a time when I
would've said
all the wrong things

38:17.363 --> 38:18.697
because I believed
in someone.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.868
A time when I would've
drank from the finger bowl

38:22.901 --> 38:25.371
just because I
wasn't supposed to.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.809
I, um,
thought it was water.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.612
I don't normally
come to places like this.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.780
Not that I
don't like it.

38:34.813 --> 38:41.553
I'm just used to
places that are
a little more relaxed.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.889
I can't remember
the last time I
was just relaxed.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.761
I wouldn't know
how to dress for it.

38:52.898 --> 38:53.899
I think I can help.

39:02.508 --> 39:05.911
We have decided
to go someplace
a little more...

39:05.944 --> 39:07.513
Relaxed.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.692
YouJANE: Yes, she does.t.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.761
NYes, she does..

39:22.794 --> 39:24.730
It's not a dirty
wetland bird.
Go for it.

39:31.637 --> 39:33.138
Predictable?
Derivative?

39:33.171 --> 39:33.472
Jane...

39:36.842 --> 39:38.410
It's priceless.

39:39.978 --> 39:40.479
NICK: Jane?

39:45.584 --> 39:47.586
What are you
doing here?

39:48.820 --> 39:52.524
Just eating food,
you know.

39:54.926 --> 39:55.961
You look nice.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.563
Thank you.

39:57.596 --> 39:58.730
Jeremy Jones.

39:58.764 --> 39:59.831
Nick.
Nice to meet you.

39:59.865 --> 40:03.435
This is Miyoko Sato.
Modern Empress.

40:03.469 --> 40:06.538
I prefer not to
shake hands.

40:06.572 --> 40:07.939
Okay.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.508
JEREMY:
So how do you two
know each other?

40:09.541 --> 40:11.477
From school.

40:11.510 --> 40:12.444
Nick, our table's ready.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.513
JEREMY:
You graduated together?

40:14.546 --> 40:15.781
Who's your friend?

40:17.683 --> 40:18.950
This is Ashley.

40:18.984 --> 40:19.485
Hi.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.620
Hi. I'm Jane.

40:24.656 --> 40:25.757
Well, we should
probably...

40:25.791 --> 40:27.759
You should probably
go eat.

40:27.793 --> 40:28.927
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.228
You, too.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.730
See you tomorrow, Jane.

40:33.599 --> 40:41.473
Sorry.

40:41.507 --> 40:43.208
That was
an interesting night.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.876
The company was lovely.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.512
Your charm is
still irritating.

40:48.780 --> 40:52.751
But I'm thinking
that dress would look good

40:52.784 --> 40:54.786
on the cover of
next month's issue.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.525
(THANKS IN JAPANESE)

41:00.559 --> 41:02.528
Still not impressed.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.063
And you should thank her.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.934
Goodnight.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.843
This is so amazing!

41:17.876 --> 41:19.044
You don't find me
irritating, do you?

41:19.077 --> 41:19.678
What?

41:19.711 --> 41:21.947
Sometimes.
Not always.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.651
How about
a little emotion here?

41:25.684 --> 41:27.753
Miyoko just told you
your dress is gonna be

41:27.786 --> 41:29.020
on the cover of
Modern Empress.

41:29.054 --> 41:31.923
That's huge!

41:31.957 --> 41:32.558
It's still sinking in.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.927
I'll wait.

41:35.961 --> 41:37.629
The cover of
Modern Empress.

41:39.565 --> 41:40.666
That's a pretty
big deal, isn't it?

41:40.699 --> 41:42.033
Yeah, it is.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.034
Congratulations.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.103
Thank you.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.907
So whTomorrow?rrow?

41:48.940 --> 41:51.309
Your friend said,
"See you tomorrow."

41:51.342 --> 41:54.880
Oh. Um, it's...
It's nothing.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.015
Oh. Right.

41:57.048 --> 41:58.684
We were
a good team tonight.

41:58.717 --> 42:01.052
Yes, we were.

42:01.086 --> 42:03.288
It's still early, actually.
We could always go back
to my place.

42:03.321 --> 42:04.723
(CLEARS THROAT)

42:05.724 --> 42:06.758
Right.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.594
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

42:08.627 --> 42:09.961
Goodnight, Jane.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.062
Goodnight, Jeremy.

42:20.739 --> 42:21.673
Hey.

42:23.642 --> 42:24.976
Ben let me in.
I hope that's okay.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.112
Yeah.

42:38.657 --> 42:41.559
So just tell me
one thing.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.095
Do you really
like her?

42:45.396 --> 42:45.731
I think I do.

42:47.833 --> 42:50.035
You know you're
killing me, right?

42:51.670 --> 42:51.770
I know.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.677
I can't do this
without you, either.

43:02.848 --> 43:04.049
You don't have to.
