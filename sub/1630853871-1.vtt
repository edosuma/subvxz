00:31.490 --> 00:32.992
Did you hear?

00:33.075 --> 00:33.784
About what?

00:33.909 --> 00:36.120
The new student.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.372
New student?

00:58.059 --> 00:59.810
<i>The wind is sweet.</i>

01:00.519 --> 01:03.272
<i>The air has a scent.</i>

01:06.192 --> 01:09.361
<i>So this is Earth.</i>

01:38.808 --> 01:39.642
Hi.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.606
<i>Sunny with scattered cherry blossoms.</i>

01:46.732 --> 01:50.569
<i>It was the day I first met</i>
<i>Ryoichi Kyogoku.</i>

01:55.241 --> 02:01.413
PSYCHIC SCHOOL WARS

02:27.273 --> 02:29.400
Original Novel by Taku Mayumura

02:33.988 --> 02:38.325
<i>The day I met Kyogoku,</i>
<i>two things happened.</i>

02:39.535 --> 02:42.329
<i>It was sunny as usual.</i>

02:42.913 --> 02:46.584
<i>A windy morning as usual.</i>

02:49.712 --> 02:51.839
You're here every morning.

02:52.715 --> 02:55.551
It's nice you walk
him every day.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.179
Yeah... It's my job.

02:58.637 --> 02:59.805
Name?

02:59.889 --> 03:03.684
Seki... Kenji Seki.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.687
Not you. The dog.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.941
I know your name.
Same class this year.

03:13.819 --> 03:17.239
His name is Shiro
for "white."

03:17.656 --> 03:19.658
Good morning, Shiro.

03:21.327 --> 03:26.665
<i>I had a conversation with</i>
<i>class rep Kahori Harukawa.</i>

03:27.166 --> 03:31.045
<i>Definitely, this year's</i>
<i>number one incident!</i>

03:31.212 --> 03:33.047
Shiro, good job!

03:33.172 --> 03:34.924
Today is the luckiest...

03:35.049 --> 03:36.091
You pervert!

03:36.217 --> 03:36.842
What?

03:36.926 --> 03:39.595
You were staring at Kahori.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.264
That obscene look
in your eyes...

03:42.389 --> 03:44.516
I was not staring at her.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.060
Yes, you were.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.811
Officer, a pervert!

03:47.895 --> 03:50.397
- Stop it!
- Help!

03:51.232 --> 03:52.066
Officer!

03:52.191 --> 03:54.360
Natsuki, stop it!

03:56.278 --> 03:57.238
Ouch...

03:57.321 --> 03:58.572
Pervert.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.241
But you were...

04:00.324 --> 04:02.826
But look.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.413
Since when?

04:07.039 --> 04:08.374
Since the beginning.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.583
All the time?

04:09.667 --> 04:10.709
All the time.

04:10.793 --> 04:14.296
Kaho must have seen it too.
How could she not?

04:15.381 --> 04:17.466
My life is over.

04:18.801 --> 04:24.098
<i>The other incident was this fatal</i>
<i>mishap and having it witnessed</i>

04:24.181 --> 04:27.434
<i>by her, Natsuki Suzuura.</i>

04:27.559 --> 04:30.729
<i>If she tells everyone at school...</i>

04:30.938 --> 04:35.776
Your fly... Your nickname as of
today is Mr. Open Fly.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.864
<i>Definitely, today is the</i>
<i>worst day of my life.</i>

04:41.907 --> 04:42.741
Him.

04:42.825 --> 04:43.617
Please!

04:43.742 --> 04:45.494
Hey, you!

04:47.413 --> 04:50.332
<i>But the truly major incident</i>

04:50.582 --> 04:54.670
<i>was already in progress</i>
<i>when I met Kyogoku.</i>

04:56.422 --> 05:01.427
<i>Even though I didn't realize</i>
<i>until much later.</i>

05:02.594 --> 05:03.929
Kaho!

05:04.138 --> 05:05.931
You went surfing
this morning.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.308
You saw me?

05:07.391 --> 05:09.685
Yeah. It's my jogging course.

05:10.602 --> 05:15.983
Starting this year, mobile phones
will not be permitted on campus.

05:16.066 --> 05:20.321
Please inform your students
about this new rule.

05:20.404 --> 05:23.991
Take a seat.
I'll be with you soon.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.200
Sure.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.537
I saw Kenji this morning too.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.707
He was walking Shiro.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.335
He used to go at night.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.463
But for some reason,
he wakes up early now.

05:38.797 --> 05:39.965
What's the matter?

05:40.049 --> 05:41.091
Nothing.

05:41.175 --> 05:44.845
Did he sexually harass you
or something?

05:44.970 --> 05:47.222
I didn't say anything.

05:47.348 --> 05:51.518
Well... What happened?
What? What? Tell me.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.354
About what?!

06:10.037 --> 06:12.998
Hot!

06:22.841 --> 06:26.178
I can't believe this.
No mobile phones?

06:26.261 --> 06:29.890
Parents and teachers only
think of themselves.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.017
This is insane.

06:32.101 --> 06:35.229
But it's no surprise
after what happened...

06:37.022 --> 06:39.191
I wonder if Yamagiwa
will show up.

06:39.274 --> 06:43.570
She's in your club, right?
There were lots of rumors.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.198
It sucks to flunk second year.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.117
I'd refuse to come
to school.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.911
You use a mobile too.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.496
Yeah but...

06:52.579 --> 06:54.581
The student council approved.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.083
Unbelievable.

06:56.625 --> 07:00.963
People who don't have one don't
understand the inconvenience.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.005
Stop it.

07:02.089 --> 07:07.261
To have one or not,
people should be free to choose.

07:07.386 --> 07:10.889
People are free to choose
to have one or not

07:10.973 --> 07:14.768
only if you can pay
attention in class.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.771
Without your mobile phones

07:17.896 --> 07:20.607
maybe you feel more anxious
than inconvenienced.

07:22.734 --> 07:23.902
Saori?

07:24.027 --> 07:25.779
No! That's not it.

07:25.863 --> 07:28.866
Then go home after school
and get it.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.909
That'd be pointless.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.954
Do you need a mobile phone
during class?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.748
Not really.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.459
During recess?

07:38.542 --> 07:39.168
Yes.

07:39.293 --> 07:42.129
Why? For an emergency?

07:42.296 --> 07:45.007
No. For texts and Twitter.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.427
Must you do them
during recess?

07:48.552 --> 07:52.556
No... So that's why
I don't use it at school.

07:52.764 --> 07:59.438
If you don't use it at school,
it means you don't need it at school.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.315
That's mean.

08:01.398 --> 08:06.612
People can't concentrate in class
because of their mobiles.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.865
So maybe you're better off
not bringing them.

08:09.990 --> 08:14.328
Mistah Sai, you're siding with
the school after all.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.163
"Mister Saito."

08:16.288 --> 08:21.293
When I was your age,
we didn't have mobiles.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.004
But I won't get into that.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.381
Real communication

08:26.632 --> 08:31.470
is more than a mobile
or an Internet connection.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.556
They're not bad things.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.726
But in your relationships
with other people

08:37.851 --> 08:41.522
there are many more important
lessons to be learned.

08:41.647 --> 08:45.108
That's the consensus,
hence this rule.

08:51.156 --> 08:56.078
All right. It's finally time to
introduce your new classmate.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.333
Whoa!

09:06.046 --> 09:07.381
In time?

09:07.464 --> 09:08.298
Wrong!

09:08.382 --> 09:11.677
Seki, the bell rang already.
You're late.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.719
Oops.

09:13.136 --> 09:18.183
It's because you wake up early
when you're not a morning person.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.893
Trying to show off, right?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.395
Mind your own business.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.730
Your fly's open again.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.692
Don't tell anyone, okay?

09:26.775 --> 09:29.653
You can't boss me around,
Mr. Open Fly.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.448
Miss Suzuura, will you
please not tell anyone?

09:33.574 --> 09:35.909
I can't hear you.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.287
Please don't tell anyone.

09:38.537 --> 09:39.871
Are you begging me?

09:40.372 --> 09:41.248
Yes.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.545
It looks like a fun class.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.256
This is your new
classmate for real.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.173
Right?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.049
Yes.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.175
Introduce yourself.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.763
I'm from the city of Hanamaki.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.641
I don't have my new
uniform yet.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.103
I'm Ryoichi Kyogoku.
Nice to meet you.

10:06.773 --> 10:07.733
Hey...

10:07.816 --> 10:08.483
What?

10:08.609 --> 10:09.860
It's him.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.575
You know him?

10:16.658 --> 10:19.119
I met him this morning.

10:19.202 --> 10:19.953
This morning?

10:35.677 --> 10:38.347
Ryoichi, what's your
mobile phone number?

10:38.472 --> 10:39.348
Number?

10:39.473 --> 10:40.891
For SMS, you know?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.477
I don't own a mobile.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.062
Why not?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.647
I don't need one.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.024
Imitating Mistah Sai?

10:49.149 --> 10:50.984
Strict parents?

10:51.109 --> 10:55.322
No. I really don't need one.
Is that not a good reason?

10:55.405 --> 10:56.990
You're kidding.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.284
You don't even text?

10:59.368 --> 11:01.036
I don't need to.

11:01.161 --> 11:05.999
Saori, he really doesn't
have a mobile phone.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.669
He's not holding
back from you.

11:08.794 --> 11:09.961
Bam!

11:10.295 --> 11:11.546
What's up?

11:11.672 --> 11:13.757
Um... You know...

11:14.299 --> 11:15.300
Water flea?

11:15.384 --> 11:18.845
Yeah. Aren't they incredible?

11:19.262 --> 11:20.931
Hey, wait!

11:21.014 --> 11:22.015
A play?

11:22.140 --> 11:24.226
Never been in one, right?

11:24.351 --> 11:27.854
Mr. Saito is the advisor this year.

11:27.938 --> 11:31.191
His classes were great last year.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.067
Really?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.861
Which club are you
going to join?

11:34.945 --> 11:37.280
You're tall.
Interested in basketball?

11:37.364 --> 11:41.034
<i>He looks like he has a secret.</i>

11:41.326 --> 11:44.162
So what?
I'm sure he does.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.372
Why do you say that?

11:45.455 --> 11:46.623
Because he's good-looking.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.042
So he's your type?

11:49.167 --> 11:53.505
All the girls were talking about him.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.091
Like in the locker room.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.385
You had a dirty thought.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.345
Ouch!

12:00.429 --> 12:03.390
Mr. Open Fly...

12:03.473 --> 12:05.976
Will you drop it?

12:06.059 --> 12:09.396
Why would a good-looking
guy have a secret?

12:09.521 --> 12:11.231
That's a girls' secret.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.399
Huh?

12:12.524 --> 12:15.861
Open... Mr. Open Fly...

12:15.944 --> 12:17.404
What's that song?

12:18.530 --> 12:21.032
Everyone is upset.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.576
About the mobile phones?

12:22.659 --> 12:23.410
Yeah.

12:23.493 --> 12:27.247
My class too. They think
the school's gone too far.

12:27.372 --> 12:32.502
They're blaming the council for
not organizing an all-school meeting.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.546
They call us traitors.

12:34.629 --> 12:38.759
Can I ask each one of you
for your opinion?

12:38.842 --> 12:40.844
In favor or against it?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.387
Amano?

12:42.471 --> 12:45.640
I suppose I'm in favor of it.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.184
Kondo?

12:47.517 --> 12:48.769
Favor.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.228
Kahori?

12:50.312 --> 12:54.441
Well, they're not an
absolute necessity.

12:54.649 --> 12:55.317
Jinno?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.861
Fine then. Favor.

12:58.069 --> 13:02.574
The girl in that mobile incident
last year was in my class.

13:02.657 --> 13:06.453
Yuriko Yamagiwa is in
my class this year.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.538
Mobile phones are convenient.

13:08.622 --> 13:13.293
But if they hurt someone,
they shouldn't be allowed at school.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.337
It's only natural.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.757
You're probably right.

13:18.840 --> 13:23.094
But people want to be involved
in the decision making.

13:23.386 --> 13:27.140
It's strange how people
are for it as individuals.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.018
But as a group,
there's an air of objection.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.187
Air, huh...

13:32.521 --> 13:37.526
Are our true feelings
inside our hearts?

13:37.776 --> 13:40.946
Or are they in the air?

13:41.029 --> 13:45.867
Obviously, our feelings are
inside ourselves.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.373
That's not always the case.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.251
Yes, it is.
What do you mean?

13:54.334 --> 13:58.547
I think some feelings occur because
of someone other than yourself.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.758
Are those feelings inside you too?

14:01.842 --> 14:07.639
Or are they in the air between
people and people?

15:16.207 --> 15:17.876
Kahori?

15:26.551 --> 15:28.637
<i>The piano was open.</i>

15:29.387 --> 15:30.430
<i>Am I not allowed?</i>

15:30.513 --> 15:32.766
<i>Don't worry. It's okay.</i>

15:32.891 --> 15:36.144
<i>Anyone can play them</i>
<i>if they're open.</i>

15:36.478 --> 15:37.812
Okay.

15:38.939 --> 15:39.814
Thanks.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.068
Are you going to practice too?

15:43.151 --> 15:44.819
Yes.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.155
You're very diligent.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.117
Not really. I don't have
a piano at home.

15:53.912 --> 15:54.955
I see.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.751
"Moonlight"...

16:01.586 --> 16:03.546
By Debussy, right?

16:04.923 --> 16:06.007
Yeah.

16:19.688 --> 16:20.981
I like...

16:25.443 --> 16:26.695
The moon.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.034
Is it weird?

16:33.159 --> 16:36.997
Not at all.
It's not weird at all.

16:40.625 --> 16:41.209
Okay.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.129
Good.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.802
He likes it.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.559
The moon.

17:24.753 --> 17:27.922
Sorry to bother you
while you're relaxing.

17:28.048 --> 17:32.135
You're wasting energy
just by being in this era.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.596
You are too.

17:36.014 --> 17:39.517
I'll report your comment
to Doctor Kyogoku.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.854
I'm sure you haven't
forgotten your mission.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.609
Moon...

17:47.942 --> 17:50.945
The moon of this era is yellow.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.073
It looks odd.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.159
But beautiful.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.431
<i>"In tale or history"</i>

18:18.515 --> 18:22.685
<i>"true love never comes to</i>
<i>a happy end easily."</i>

18:22.769 --> 18:25.105
<i>"If people are in love</i>
<i>with each other,"</i>

18:25.230 --> 18:28.483
<i>"war, death, or sickness"</i>

18:28.608 --> 18:30.777
<i>"would get in their way."</i>

18:30.902 --> 18:33.947
<i>"Then the love melts</i>
<i>away immediately."</i>

18:34.948 --> 18:39.160
"Making it momentary as a sound,
swift as a shadow"

18:39.452 --> 18:41.621
"short as any dream."

18:43.456 --> 18:46.459
It's still Lysander's line, right?

18:46.543 --> 18:49.629
Is there any meaning
in doing plays?

18:50.130 --> 18:51.047
Meaning?

18:51.131 --> 18:51.923
Yeah.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.802
I don't think there's any meaning.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.053
A necessity?

18:57.137 --> 19:00.140
No, not a necessity either.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.100
Then why?

19:03.017 --> 19:04.477
So why...

19:05.019 --> 19:08.481
Kyogoku, you have a
philosophical mind.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.859
Do you know why?

19:10.984 --> 19:13.069
You're asking me?

19:13.236 --> 19:17.782
The man who wrote
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" said

19:17.991 --> 19:24.205
"acting is holding a mirror up to nature
and showing the form of truth."

19:24.330 --> 19:28.585
Mirrors were invented because
people want to see their faces.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.380
I think acting is the same.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.257
That's confusing.

19:35.675 --> 19:41.848
When you act, in the limited time,
momentary you becomes real.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.766
Momentary?

19:43.850 --> 19:49.063
Yes. Why don't you look for your
answer in those moments?

19:49.314 --> 19:52.233
The moments called "now."

19:52.650 --> 19:56.487
It sounds like you're
dodging the question.

19:56.863 --> 20:01.784
I was trying to be cool. I just
want you to enjoy yourselves.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.412
That's what it means
to be alive.

20:04.537 --> 20:08.791
Acting is also something
living people do.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.963
<i>Is Mr. Saito always like that?</i>

20:14.047 --> 20:18.009
<i>Yeah. Kenji and I were in</i>
<i>his class last year too.</i>

20:18.092 --> 20:18.927
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

20:19.052 --> 20:22.388
<i>Mistah Sai is a cool dude</i>
<i>but he hates that name.</i>

20:22.472 --> 20:24.182
<i>Don't say it to his face.</i>

20:24.265 --> 20:26.768
<i>It bothers him, huh?</i>

20:26.893 --> 20:29.145
<i>But it doesn't stop anybody.</i>

20:31.397 --> 20:34.317
What made you interested in acting?

20:34.692 --> 20:36.569
Yeah. What?

20:38.071 --> 20:42.367
I was wondering about the
significance of saying words

20:42.450 --> 20:44.118
that aren't your real thoughts.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.246
Wow... Complex.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.665
What's the purpose
of the process?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.041
Process?

20:50.458 --> 20:52.961
I suppose you could
call it that.

20:53.086 --> 20:58.508
But we're talking now even though
we don't know each other's thoughts.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.594
In that sense,
it's the same, isn't it?

21:01.719 --> 21:04.639
Yeah, that's true.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.518
You're totally lost, aren't you?

21:08.601 --> 21:09.811
You can tell?

21:11.104 --> 21:13.690
Sometimes words aren't necessary.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.109
Yeah.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.070
I don't get it.
So what?!

21:19.153 --> 21:23.533
Really? I had a feeling
you understood it all.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.285
Was I wrong?

21:29.372 --> 21:31.874
What kind of psychic
power is that?

21:40.216 --> 21:43.803
Wow! It is an amazing view.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.556
Isn't it?! Over here.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.309
A kite?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.936
I'm not joking.
It's true.

21:52.312 --> 21:55.857
It stole my lunch
when I was a kid.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.192
The bad kite.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.903
"Beware of kites:
they steal food"

22:02.488 --> 22:04.991
This place is nice.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.534
You think so?

22:07.493 --> 22:09.787
I'm happy to hear that.

22:11.456 --> 22:14.292
Beware of kites.
They steal food.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.335
Chomp.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.715
She'll think you're a
pervert if you keep staring.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.508
Was I staring?

22:22.592 --> 22:25.345
Yes. Totally. Gawking.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.929
What are you doing?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.892
Nothing.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.364
You like Kahori that much, huh?

22:44.447 --> 22:45.782
Are you a psychic?

22:45.865 --> 22:49.369
Maybe. I can read your mind.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.414
It was so obvious.
Cheer up.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.207
I can't.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.291
Try.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.542
But...

22:58.378 --> 23:01.464
You wouldn't understand my feelings.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.969
Why do you say that?

23:07.053 --> 23:07.845
Huh?

23:07.929 --> 23:09.931
How do you know?!

23:10.139 --> 23:11.391
Natsuki?

23:30.076 --> 23:31.244
Natsuki!

23:41.337 --> 23:44.841
<i>This is the symbol</i>
<i>you drew, is it not?</i>

23:45.216 --> 23:48.719
<i>Y I n</i> ¢ <i>li v i</i>
<i>es! ca t be e e t!</i>

23:48.803 --> 23:51.180
<i>I read your mind.</i>

23:51.389 --> 23:52.640
<i>Wow!</i>

23:54.267 --> 23:56.811
<i>Telepathy, law of physics.</i>

23:59.021 --> 24:01.357
People can't read
people's minds.

24:01.566 --> 24:04.235
That's true.

24:04.318 --> 24:08.281
Being psychic would be
convenient but I'm not.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.367
It's like owning
a mobile phone.

24:11.451 --> 24:14.745
At my age, it makes no difference
if I have one or not.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.622
It's about your age?

24:16.706 --> 24:21.794
I have one only because others
find it inconvenient if I don't.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.297
Are you a psychic?

24:24.714 --> 24:27.717
I'm talking about mobile phones.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.887
Why do you want
to be a psychic?

24:33.890 --> 24:37.768
Have you ever wanted to know
someone's feelings?

24:37.852 --> 24:39.562
Their real feelings.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.817
You're so perceptive.

24:44.942 --> 24:47.445
Thanks for cheering me up.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.741
Kenji, go help your dad
in the kitchen!

24:51.824 --> 24:53.201
Okay!

25:50.800 --> 25:52.802
Hey, that's enough!

25:55.012 --> 25:56.180
You okay?

25:56.264 --> 25:57.890
Sorry! Sorry!

25:58.140 --> 25:59.892
What do you want?

26:00.142 --> 26:02.228
You won't answer
your mobile.

26:02.353 --> 26:03.396
Because...

26:03.521 --> 26:06.190
I wanted to apologize
for earlier.

26:07.400 --> 26:11.070
I'm sorry for saying you wouldn't
understand my feelings.

26:11.195 --> 26:12.780
I'll tell you how I feel.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.992
You see... I...

26:17.577 --> 26:19.078
I've had...

26:21.163 --> 26:23.708
A crush on Kahori
for a while now.

26:24.834 --> 26:28.588
So I wanted to talk
to you about her.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.464
You're a jerk!

26:37.054 --> 26:38.264
Why?

27:31.400 --> 27:32.610
You can't do it.

27:51.253 --> 27:52.672
Why?

27:53.339 --> 27:55.341
Why did you help me?

27:55.591 --> 28:02.098
Because you didn't intend
to jump in the first place.

28:07.770 --> 28:10.356
What do you mean?
Who are you?!

28:11.357 --> 28:16.946
You're Yuriko Yamagiwa,
2nd year in middle school, again.

28:17.154 --> 28:20.658
You think nobody understands
your feelings

28:20.825 --> 28:25.121
so you were going to jump
but in truth, you don't want to die.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.708
Shut up!
You don't even know me!

28:29.291 --> 28:33.629
Know you?
I don't need to.

28:36.298 --> 28:40.386
I understand.
I can hear it.

28:40.803 --> 28:43.055
The voice in your heart.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.816
You want to live
more than anybody.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.903
It's tough not being understood.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.030
Stop it!

29:05.244 --> 29:06.245
Ryoichi...

29:06.370 --> 29:08.622
I know.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.916
She's perfect.

29:19.425 --> 29:23.053
You want to read people's
minds, don't you?

29:23.596 --> 29:25.264
Wait... What...

29:25.389 --> 29:27.308
You have the power.

29:27.433 --> 29:31.604
Without it, your voice wouldn't
be reaching me.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.940
I don't get it! Stop!

29:36.901 --> 29:38.694
Come here.

29:38.944 --> 29:44.116
Come here and nobody
can lie to you anymore.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.064
<i>Hello? Kaho?</i>

30:15.940 --> 30:17.691
Oh, sorry.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.320
I'll wait and eat with you.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.658
I'll see you when
you finish work.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.451
Bye.

30:53.686 --> 30:57.189
Natsu... Hey, Natsu!

30:57.773 --> 31:01.610
What is it?
I'm sleepy.

31:01.694 --> 31:05.823
I get sleepy when I'm angry.
You have a problem with that?

31:06.115 --> 31:09.869
They're really pretty.
Can you see?

31:10.035 --> 31:12.329
Natsu, look!

31:12.454 --> 31:17.209
Will you stop bothering me?
What is it?

31:17.334 --> 31:21.422
Natsu, aren't they so cool?!

31:21.547 --> 31:27.511
I like you.
I like you so much, Kenji.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.518
Aren't they cool?!

31:35.144 --> 31:38.814
We can see better over there.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.904
So tell me...

31:46.363 --> 31:49.909
What are you gonna be
when you grow up?

31:50.993 --> 31:55.873
I'm gonna run the inn
because everyone loves it.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.250
Good.

31:59.084 --> 32:02.838
So you'll always be my
next-door neighbor.

32:04.006 --> 32:07.092
You won't go to Tokyo
or something?

32:07.384 --> 32:10.554
I like you so much...

32:10.638 --> 32:11.639
What?

32:12.514 --> 32:14.767
I really, really like you.

32:14.892 --> 32:15.601
Huh?

32:17.269 --> 32:18.938
I like you, Kenji.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.731
So much!

32:21.482 --> 32:22.441
What?

32:22.942 --> 32:25.945
I like you.
I like you so much.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.112
So much!

32:36.872 --> 32:37.748
I'm saying...!

32:39.917 --> 32:43.003
I like you so much, Kenji.

32:43.128 --> 32:46.173
I like you so, so much!

33:00.104 --> 33:01.772
<i>I had a dream.</i>

33:03.649 --> 33:07.486
<i>The dream I hadn't</i>
<i>had in a while.</i>

33:09.989 --> 33:11.490
Natsuki!

33:12.074 --> 33:13.534
Are you awake?

33:14.159 --> 33:15.327
<i>I realize now</i>

33:15.786 --> 33:20.791
<i>that day, our hands were connected</i>
<i>but our hearts weren't.</i>

33:21.959 --> 33:25.629
<i>We've lived next door to</i>
<i>each other all our lives.</i>

33:25.713 --> 33:31.218
<i>Same pre-school, same grade</i>
<i>school, same middle school...</i>

33:31.427 --> 33:33.303
<i>Same homeroom.</i>

33:33.512 --> 33:37.099
<i>Our student IDs and lockers</i>
<i>are next to each other.</i>

33:38.017 --> 33:40.102
<i>Forever the girl next door.</i>

33:40.185 --> 33:43.647
<i>Yes that's me.</i>

33:43.856 --> 33:48.819
<i>Always was, still am,</i>
<i>and will be from now on.</i>

33:48.986 --> 33:53.073
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

33:55.367 --> 33:56.118
Natsuki!

34:08.380 --> 34:10.382
<i>I wish...</i>

34:13.218 --> 34:15.846
<i>I could stop liking him.</i>

34:35.407 --> 34:37.409
Go on in.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.953
Excuse me... Passing through.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.706
Good morning, Yuriko.

34:42.790 --> 34:44.583
Good morning, Natsuki.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.544
You know my name?

34:47.628 --> 34:49.254
From the seating chart.

34:49.546 --> 34:50.714
Good morning.

34:51.381 --> 34:52.716
Good morning.

35:00.766 --> 35:04.478
<i>Yuriko looked so calm and confident.</i>

35:04.603 --> 35:08.941
Yeah. I wonder why she decided
to start coming to school now.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.776
I'm glad she did though.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.319
You were worried about her?

35:12.444 --> 35:16.615
Sort of... Because I've never
been absent from school.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.368
You still have a
perfect attendance?

35:19.451 --> 35:20.452
Yep.

35:20.577 --> 35:23.747
Miss Suzuura, any concerns
about your record?

35:23.831 --> 35:25.165
Sickness, no.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.292
How about a love sickness?

35:28.544 --> 35:29.711
No way.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.464
You never know.
You might fall in love.

35:32.589 --> 35:38.846
Impossible. But if I did fall in love,
I'd come to school to see him.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.056
Yeah, that's true.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.809
I know... The new
guy is hot, isn't he?

35:46.228 --> 35:50.732
You're going to tell
me everything today.

36:34.651 --> 36:37.571
You're here already, Kenji.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.492
What are you doing here?

36:44.161 --> 36:48.749
You're not making any sense.
How should I respond to that?

36:48.874 --> 36:51.668
Oh... I just thought...

36:52.502 --> 36:54.421
Sorry. My mistake.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.924
Sorry about that.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.181
Shots of the sky?

37:04.598 --> 37:05.724
No. Clouds.

37:05.807 --> 37:06.808
Clouds?

37:07.517 --> 37:09.770
Clouds that look like something.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.731
What does this look like?

37:13.398 --> 37:15.859
This? A hamburger.

37:15.943 --> 37:18.070
Oh... How about this?

37:18.153 --> 37:19.321
A cheeseburger.

37:19.404 --> 37:20.864
That's funny!

37:21.782 --> 37:26.662
Look closely. This part looks
like melted cheese...

37:28.914 --> 37:31.250
Hungry, huh?

37:42.844 --> 37:45.430
So love at first sight
really happens.

37:45.764 --> 37:50.435
I'm sorry. I feel like I unloaded
everything on you.

37:50.644 --> 37:53.272
You have to vent your
feelings sometimes.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.691
You're too much
of a good girl.

37:56.275 --> 37:58.944
I'm not a good girl at all.

37:59.278 --> 38:03.865
Oh, come on...
The new guy is so lucky.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.369
He plays the piano
really well too.

38:11.790 --> 38:16.044
It's so strange that I feel this way.

38:16.128 --> 38:17.129
No, it's not.

38:17.254 --> 38:22.634
Sometimes you can't explain why
you like someone so much.

38:22.759 --> 38:23.969
You think so?

38:24.094 --> 38:27.639
Yes. I really think so.

38:31.476 --> 38:34.646
So when are you going to
tell him how you feel?

38:34.730 --> 38:37.232
I'm not going to.

38:37.316 --> 38:42.821
Why not? Before we know it,
we'll be graduating middle school.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.033
That's fine with me.

38:54.666 --> 38:59.004
Wow! Was the view from here
always this pretty?

39:00.672 --> 39:06.011
I think this is the most beautiful
sunset I've ever seen.

39:09.765 --> 39:10.766
So...

39:11.016 --> 39:12.184
Yeah?

39:12.517 --> 39:15.270
Aren't you attracted to anybody?

39:15.354 --> 39:17.147
No. Nobody.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.608
I don't believe you.
How about Kenji?

39:19.775 --> 39:24.029
Oh, please. Just because
we're next-door neighbors...

39:25.030 --> 39:28.492
He's an insensitive jerk.

39:29.368 --> 39:33.121
Oh... So he's really not the one?

39:38.335 --> 39:38.919
Natsuki?

39:39.044 --> 39:42.714
He and I are next-door neighbors.

39:42.881 --> 39:46.593
Nothing more, nothing less.

39:46.718 --> 39:51.556
Ask him. I'm sure he'll
say the same thing.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.980
You're kind of weird, Kyogoku.

39:59.606 --> 40:00.774
Why?

40:00.899 --> 40:03.485
You've never eaten
a hamburger.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.695
That makes me weird?

40:05.779 --> 40:08.740
Yes. Are your parents strict?

40:09.783 --> 40:12.411
No. Nothing like that.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.122
Incredible.

40:20.752 --> 40:24.423
There's something
I want to ask you.

40:24.714 --> 40:25.799
What is it?

40:25.924 --> 40:30.011
When we first met, did you
say, "So this is Earth."?

40:30.429 --> 40:32.347
Did you say that
to anyone?

40:32.431 --> 40:33.932
No. Why?

40:34.057 --> 40:35.642
They'll think I'm weird.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.602
They already do.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.189
You were wearing headphones.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.276
Yeah, I was.

40:44.401 --> 40:46.778
If you heard me,
you're a psychic.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.029
True.

40:48.405 --> 40:49.614
I said it.

40:51.283 --> 40:54.119
I said it in my mind.

40:54.244 --> 40:57.247
I think you're a psychic.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.584
Are you serious?

41:00.667 --> 41:02.294
Of course.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.129
Then are you an alien?

41:04.254 --> 41:07.674
I'm more like a guy
from the future.

41:09.468 --> 41:12.220
So a psychic
and a guy from the future

41:12.304 --> 41:16.016
are eating hamburgers
in the sunset.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.143
That's right.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.523
That's exactly right.

41:28.320 --> 41:32.324
<i>I'll bring from the future</i>
<i>the food you're craving.</i>

41:32.449 --> 41:36.453
<i>Three, two, one, open.</i>

41:36.536 --> 41:38.121
From the future...

41:40.415 --> 41:43.460
<i>Time warp, law of physics.</i>

41:45.003 --> 41:49.132
Ryoichi, you ate food from this era.

41:49.799 --> 41:52.135
Don't get involved more
than you have to.

41:52.219 --> 41:55.013
The kid, Kenji, you know he's...

41:55.096 --> 41:57.849
An obstacle in our plan.

41:58.475 --> 42:01.895
Dad chose this era
because he's here.

42:02.521 --> 42:03.813
To get revenge.

42:04.648 --> 42:08.902
I'm not authorized to
speak on his behalf.

42:09.069 --> 42:11.238
Will there be a battle?

42:11.446 --> 42:16.117
He's a dangerous wild card.
That's all I can say.

42:16.868 --> 42:19.371
Let's continue the program.

42:19.496 --> 42:21.998
We have several
power-user candidates.

42:22.707 --> 42:27.879
People of this era should
handle their own affairs.

42:49.568 --> 42:51.570
<i>You're running a lot lately.</i>

42:51.653 --> 42:56.700
I want to go to high school in Tokyo
and join the track team.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.952
Wow! A sports nomination.

42:59.077 --> 43:02.956
I just started thinking about it.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.833
Team practice after school?

43:04.916 --> 43:06.084
Yeah.

43:06.543 --> 43:08.044
And you?
The council?

43:08.128 --> 43:10.755
A meeting about
the mobile phones.

43:10.839 --> 43:14.342
Something about punishing
students who break the rule.

43:14.551 --> 43:17.262
Then piano practice, right?
Maybe I'll see you.

43:17.387 --> 43:19.723
Really? I'll wait for you.

43:23.560 --> 43:26.271
They're together a lot
these days.

43:26.438 --> 43:27.105
You think?

43:27.230 --> 43:30.650
Oops... Not that it
means anything.

43:31.151 --> 43:32.569
It doesn't bother me.

43:32.652 --> 43:33.612
Come on...

43:33.695 --> 43:36.114
No talking about this at school.

43:36.406 --> 43:37.824
What part of speech is this?

43:37.949 --> 43:39.701
Japanese!

43:39.784 --> 43:40.785
Um...

43:41.077 --> 43:42.662
Japanese.

43:42.787 --> 43:43.580
A prefix.

43:43.788 --> 43:47.292
Yes, a prefix.
What comes after this?

43:47.459 --> 43:48.084
Japanese.

43:48.168 --> 43:49.169
Toyama!

43:49.294 --> 43:50.629
You still mad?

43:51.630 --> 43:53.798
I'm sorry about the acorns.

43:54.299 --> 43:57.302
Come on. I'm sorry.

43:57.802 --> 43:59.012
Did it hurt that much?

44:02.807 --> 44:04.309
Yes.

44:05.310 --> 44:07.062
My heart ached.

44:07.395 --> 44:09.564
Huh? Heart?

44:09.981 --> 44:11.566
As in chest...

44:14.903 --> 44:16.821
No... No...

44:17.656 --> 44:19.282
You're awful!

44:21.743 --> 44:22.952
Jerk!

44:24.454 --> 44:25.622
Natsuki!

44:25.705 --> 44:29.584
Ouch!!!

44:34.839 --> 44:38.009
Oh... Kaho's not here yet.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.284
Did you see Soga?

45:03.368 --> 45:06.496
President Soga?
I didn't see her.

45:06.663 --> 45:07.872
She's absent today.

45:07.997 --> 45:10.959
But I saw her this morning.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.044
Really?

45:13.169 --> 45:17.340
She wasn't at the meeting.
Maybe she left early.

45:49.164 --> 45:51.833
What's going on?

45:51.916 --> 45:56.880
A ritual to become a human
who can live in the future.

45:56.963 --> 45:58.757
Haruka Soga passed the test.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.759
What?

46:00.842 --> 46:03.386
But you don't. I'm sorry.

46:04.095 --> 46:07.891
I can't hear the voice in your heart.

46:08.433 --> 46:11.436
You should keep your mouth shut.

46:11.561 --> 46:14.981
Are you trying to increase
my work load?

46:15.106 --> 46:17.358
What?! It talked!

46:17.442 --> 46:20.612
I wish you were like us.

46:20.904 --> 46:24.699
Too bad because you're
a really nice person.

46:25.909 --> 46:27.076
Ouch!

46:28.036 --> 46:30.205
This hurts!

46:38.838 --> 46:41.341
Help! Kenji, help!

46:41.466 --> 46:42.550
Stop it.

46:48.515 --> 46:50.266
That hurt!

46:52.143 --> 46:53.228
Ryoichi?

46:55.063 --> 46:56.397
Are you okay?

46:58.650 --> 47:01.820
Don't tell anyone
about today, okay?

47:01.903 --> 47:05.406
Who are you?
What are you?

47:05.490 --> 47:07.158
Human beings. No?

47:07.283 --> 47:09.786
You look like human beings but...

47:09.869 --> 47:14.040
People are coming.
We better go.

47:18.002 --> 47:22.674
Not too bad that the student
council president has the power.

47:22.757 --> 47:25.343
We can accelerate the plan.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.743
Kahori...

47:52.203 --> 47:53.580
I'm glad you're here.

47:55.540 --> 47:59.127
I borrowed this without asking.
Thanks.

48:00.545 --> 48:03.882
Are you going to practice
"Moonlight" too?

48:04.007 --> 48:08.136
Yes... I want to learn
how to play it.

48:09.554 --> 48:12.390
I want to hear you
play it one day.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.691
What's taking Natsuki so long?

48:41.920 --> 48:45.423
<i>I don't remember my father.</i>

48:46.007 --> 48:47.926
<i>He was a fisherman.</i>

48:48.092 --> 48:49.260
<i>One stormy night</i>

48:49.719 --> 48:55.141
<i>he drowned trying to save</i>
<i>his friend who fell off a boat.</i>

48:56.434 --> 49:00.355
<i>My mother is afraid of the sea.</i>

49:00.772 --> 49:03.775
<i>She worries about me</i>
<i>being here.</i>

49:03.858 --> 49:10.365
<i>Coming to the sea is my</i>
<i>only act of rebellion.</i>

49:12.617 --> 49:17.372
<i>Because I think Dad</i>
<i>wasn't afraid of the sea.</i>

49:19.123 --> 49:23.628
<i>This is the only place where</i>
<i>I can feel my father.</i>

49:24.379 --> 49:27.382
<i>Where I can talk to him.</i>

49:37.558 --> 49:38.643
Shiro!

49:38.768 --> 49:40.311
Sorry, Kahori!

49:40.979 --> 49:44.482
Good boy.
How old is he?

49:44.565 --> 49:47.443
Pretty old.
In his teens.

49:47.527 --> 49:49.487
He's that old?

49:49.570 --> 49:52.740
We've had him since
I was a small kid.

49:52.824 --> 49:54.534
He looks younger.

49:54.659 --> 49:56.953
Yeah? I wonder why.

49:59.664 --> 50:01.332
By the way...

50:01.833 --> 50:03.001
Did you see Natsuki today?

50:03.251 --> 50:06.504
No. She hasn't come
to school for days.

50:08.047 --> 50:09.173
Have you talked to her?

50:09.257 --> 50:11.300
No. She won't
answer her phone.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.846
She doesn't take
my calls either.

50:14.929 --> 50:16.597
I'm worried.

50:19.017 --> 50:21.352
Her perfect attendance
record stopped.

50:21.436 --> 50:22.979
You knew about it?

50:23.062 --> 50:25.690
She told me.

50:25.940 --> 50:27.692
Now it's just me.

50:27.817 --> 50:29.318
You too?

50:29.402 --> 50:30.820
I'm always late though.

50:37.702 --> 50:39.037
Um...!

50:39.120 --> 50:39.704
Yes?

50:39.829 --> 50:44.375
Are you interested in
anyone right now?

51:06.064 --> 51:11.736
Students are forbidden to bring
mobiles to school.

51:12.070 --> 51:17.742
But many are breaking the rule
and secretly bringing them.

51:17.909 --> 51:21.079
They should be punished strictly.

51:21.287 --> 51:23.623
We should make a proposal...

51:24.082 --> 51:26.834
Suspended? That strict?

51:27.752 --> 51:29.921
For disobeying the school rule.

51:30.004 --> 51:35.676
I know that! But do we even have
the authority to decide?!

51:35.760 --> 51:37.553
We do have the authority.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.431
Supplement 2 of Article 10.

51:40.515 --> 51:44.852
"The student council may propose
rules when deemed necessary."

51:45.770 --> 51:48.898
The rules become effective upon
the student assembly's approval.

51:49.774 --> 51:51.776
Yeah but...

51:51.859 --> 51:57.198
It also says "in case of an emergency,
they become effective immediately."

51:57.281 --> 51:59.450
The advisor has to approve.

51:59.575 --> 52:02.870
Mr. Yamada is on sick leave
starting today.

52:03.496 --> 52:05.998
Then advisor approval
won't be necessary.

52:06.124 --> 52:09.460
Wait! He was fine yesterday...

52:09.544 --> 52:12.130
Yeah. What happened?

52:13.631 --> 52:15.967
Let's take a vote.

52:16.050 --> 52:17.760
We haven't discussed...

52:17.844 --> 52:19.512
Those in favor?

52:21.472 --> 52:24.809
See? This is crazy...

52:27.353 --> 52:27.979
Why?

52:28.062 --> 52:30.231
We have the majority.

52:33.067 --> 52:34.485
Yukari...

52:37.572 --> 52:40.950
This rule has been approved
by the council.

52:45.079 --> 52:46.747
What's going on?

52:46.831 --> 52:47.832
I don't know.

52:47.957 --> 52:51.878
Everybody seems like
a different person.

52:52.003 --> 52:54.422
I said I don't know!

52:56.674 --> 52:57.466
Sorry.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.845
Haven't you felt it?

53:00.928 --> 53:05.016
Strange things are
happening around me.

53:06.017 --> 53:09.103
People's personalities
are suddenly changing.

53:09.187 --> 53:12.273
One student after another.

53:13.566 --> 53:17.570
On the other hand, many have
stopped coming to school.

53:17.695 --> 53:20.948
23 in total.

53:21.032 --> 53:22.366
So many?

53:22.491 --> 53:24.410
I'm worried too.

53:24.535 --> 53:28.206
None of them are
responding to my calls.

53:28.289 --> 53:32.460
People are anxious and that's why
they bring their mobiles.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.962
They feel lonely at school.

53:35.880 --> 53:41.427
But the ones who have changed
act like nothing's wrong. To me...

53:43.221 --> 53:47.391
You might think I've gone crazy too.

53:47.475 --> 53:49.560
What? Tell me.

53:51.729 --> 53:54.899
It's like they're communicating
without words.

53:57.902 --> 54:02.073
Like telepathy.
Does it seem like that to you?

54:05.326 --> 54:10.581
Do you want to visit Mr. Yamada
after school?

54:10.748 --> 54:13.376
Yeah. I'm worried
about him too.

54:13.834 --> 54:16.003
Let me go home first.

54:16.420 --> 54:18.422
Let's get in touch
on our mobiles.

54:18.506 --> 54:23.094
Um... I don't have a mobile phone.

54:31.727 --> 54:35.189
Natsuki's not even
answering her phone.

54:35.273 --> 54:37.024
Doesn't she want
her pillow?

54:38.276 --> 54:39.944
Waiting for someone?

54:40.611 --> 54:41.779
Yes.

54:41.862 --> 54:45.199
Do you mind if I waited with you?

54:45.449 --> 54:47.243
No, I don't mind.

54:48.202 --> 54:51.122
Really? Good.

54:55.293 --> 54:59.630
I wanted mobile phones to
disappear from the world.

55:00.548 --> 55:05.886
They're nothing but trouble.
They can harm you and others.

55:05.970 --> 55:08.472
Such a flawed tool.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.558
Flawed?

55:10.891 --> 55:15.813
You're not alone...
You're always connected to others...

55:15.938 --> 55:22.778
A silly device that people use to lie
to themselves and avoid reality.

55:24.655 --> 55:29.827
Why use mobile phones?
In this world, there's a perfect way.

55:37.585 --> 55:41.589
I wanted to warn you.

55:41.672 --> 55:42.673
Warn me?

55:42.798 --> 55:49.013
What you're trying to do
won't be good for anybody.

55:49.680 --> 55:52.850
Jinno, vice president
of the student council...

55:53.100 --> 55:56.103
Too bad he missed his date.

55:56.729 --> 55:57.897
What happened?

55:58.689 --> 55:59.690
He moved.

56:01.025 --> 56:03.944
People are better off
without mobile phones.

56:04.028 --> 56:07.782
That way, they wish for
the power we have.

56:08.449 --> 56:14.789
Now aren't you curious about
people's true thoughts?

56:16.540 --> 56:21.295
It's lonely when you don't
know people's real feelings.

56:21.379 --> 56:24.882
When people don't
understand yours.

56:25.216 --> 56:28.969
But... What can you do about it?

56:29.303 --> 56:31.055
Be born again.

56:31.389 --> 56:36.394
In the future, people can't
live without that power.

56:36.894 --> 56:39.313
That's what he said
so it must be true.

56:39.397 --> 56:42.566
He? Are you talking about...

56:45.653 --> 56:47.488
Do you want to try?

56:48.406 --> 56:49.824
Why don't you?

56:51.409 --> 56:53.994
Try? Try what?

56:54.078 --> 56:55.746
It's like soap bubbles.

56:55.871 --> 56:57.540
Soap bubbles?

56:58.582 --> 57:02.503
Everybody has her own
world inside her.

57:04.046 --> 57:08.801
Look at the worlds inside
the soap bubbles.

57:09.093 --> 57:12.930
But the worlds aren't connected.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.932
It's lonely.

57:15.266 --> 57:18.769
So we'll connect them.

57:19.353 --> 57:21.605
See? Not lonely anymore.

57:23.691 --> 57:24.608
They'll disappear.

57:24.733 --> 57:26.068
Normally yes.

57:26.152 --> 57:30.156
That's why you have to try
and see if you have the power.

57:56.140 --> 57:57.266
Kahori!

58:06.734 --> 58:08.569
What happened?!

58:09.653 --> 58:11.489
Are you okay?!

58:13.157 --> 58:14.533
<i>Are you okay?</i>

58:16.160 --> 58:17.745
Let's get out of here.

58:18.078 --> 58:21.832
Hold on. I'm fine.
I can stand up.

58:22.166 --> 58:23.000
Sorry.

58:23.083 --> 58:24.585
It's okay.

58:24.668 --> 58:26.128
Wait!

58:33.844 --> 58:37.848
Are you sure he was
born with the power?

58:38.349 --> 58:40.851
He didn't respond to my voice.

58:40.935 --> 58:43.687
But he came to help her.

58:43.812 --> 58:44.980
And that power...

58:45.064 --> 58:47.024
Maybe Kahori has the power.

58:47.107 --> 58:49.652
No, not her.

58:50.027 --> 58:53.030
The boy's power has been blocked.

58:53.280 --> 58:57.785
And I have an idea
who did it and why.

58:57.868 --> 59:00.704
Sorry. I was still
holding your hand.

59:07.211 --> 59:08.379
Hi there.

59:08.462 --> 59:09.964
Grandpa!

59:10.047 --> 59:13.008
My room is upstairs.

59:13.092 --> 59:15.511
Let's talk there,
if you don't mind.

59:16.428 --> 59:18.556
I'll get something to drink.

59:20.224 --> 59:22.977
Iced tea... Iced tea...

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:04.268
No... This isn't...

1:00:04.351 --> 1:00:06.604
I'm sorry to intrude.

1:00:06.729 --> 1:00:09.898
Hey, please!

1:00:11.025 --> 1:00:13.527
I was so surprised.

1:00:15.195 --> 1:00:16.614
Me too.

1:00:16.739 --> 1:00:20.659
Natsuki, stop sneaking into
my room from the window.

1:00:20.784 --> 1:00:23.621
Then stop shooting acorns.

1:00:23.704 --> 1:00:26.290
You fell once and
broke your leg.

1:00:26.415 --> 1:00:28.083
That was you.

1:00:28.167 --> 1:00:29.460
It was?

1:00:29.543 --> 1:00:33.047
When we were talking on
the paper-cup phones...

1:00:36.550 --> 1:00:40.554
Being here makes what happened
earlier seem like a dream.

1:00:40.638 --> 1:00:42.973
Did it really happen?

1:00:43.098 --> 1:00:45.184
Do you feel okay?

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:47.436
Thanks. I'm not afraid anymore.

1:00:47.978 --> 1:00:52.232
Afraid? Did the new guy
threaten you too?

1:00:58.322 --> 1:01:00.991
Did Kyogoku do something to you?

1:01:01.075 --> 1:01:01.742
Forget it.

1:01:01.825 --> 1:01:04.953
Is that why you stopped
coming to school?

1:01:05.037 --> 1:01:06.205
I don't know anything.

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:07.665
I thought so.

1:01:08.540 --> 1:01:13.545
He has something to do with
what's happening at school.

1:01:15.756 --> 1:01:21.929
Natsuki, I want to know what he's
trying to do at our school.

1:01:23.722 --> 1:01:25.432
Tell me, Natsuki.

1:01:26.016 --> 1:01:27.601
What happened?

1:01:49.707 --> 1:01:51.041
<i>I see.</i>

1:01:51.375 --> 1:01:53.627
That means...

1:01:56.922 --> 1:01:57.715
It was...

1:01:58.382 --> 1:02:00.384
I haven't said anything yet.

1:02:00.467 --> 1:02:04.930
You were about to say something
stupid. I read your mind.

1:02:05.055 --> 1:02:08.392
According to your story,
you're not a psychic.

1:02:08.475 --> 1:02:12.312
I'm not.
So it's a mystery, isn't it?

1:02:14.398 --> 1:02:17.568
I'm going to go home.

1:02:17.651 --> 1:02:20.154
Isn't it dangerous?
You can...

1:02:20.237 --> 1:02:22.448
Sleep over?!
Are you serious?!

1:02:22.573 --> 1:02:26.118
Thanks but I'm fine.
I'm glad you're okay, Natsuki.

1:02:26.452 --> 1:02:27.745
I'll take you home.

1:02:27.828 --> 1:02:29.163
Me too.

1:02:29.246 --> 1:02:30.539
You're in your pajamas.

1:02:30.622 --> 1:02:32.207
Give me five minutes.

1:02:33.208 --> 1:02:37.254
Stop using the window!
And take your pillow!

1:03:06.784 --> 1:03:11.789
I feel better now. I should vent
my feelings sometimes too.

1:03:11.872 --> 1:03:14.792
You're always venting.

1:03:14.917 --> 1:03:17.419
No. I never do.

1:03:17.503 --> 1:03:19.213
Then you should.

1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:27.054
I won't be responsible for what
happens when I vent.

1:03:31.975 --> 1:03:33.560
Natsuki...

1:03:35.479 --> 1:03:37.648
Come to school.

1:03:38.148 --> 1:03:43.487
I don't know how Kyogoku and the
others want to change the world.

1:03:43.612 --> 1:03:46.490
But I want our lives
to be normal.

1:03:46.573 --> 1:03:50.244
We've always been
together, haven't we?

1:03:54.498 --> 1:03:56.416
That's not your line.

1:03:58.335 --> 1:03:59.962
It's not your line!

1:04:05.008 --> 1:04:06.343
Natsuki...

1:04:11.014 --> 1:04:14.268
I can worry if I want.

1:04:15.185 --> 1:04:16.520
Jerk.

1:04:17.604 --> 1:04:21.275
How did Kaho turn you down?

1:04:21.358 --> 1:04:23.652
You're asking me now?

1:04:23.735 --> 1:04:26.363
Tell me and
I'll go to school.

1:04:28.782 --> 1:04:32.452
Okay, fine, whatever.

1:04:52.848 --> 1:04:56.435
Are you okay?

1:04:56.894 --> 1:04:59.897
Mr. Open Fly.

1:05:00.147 --> 1:05:02.983
But you promised, okay?

1:05:04.735 --> 1:05:07.821
Bring your mobile
if you're worried.

1:05:08.155 --> 1:05:10.908
I'll bring mine too.

1:05:16.580 --> 1:05:17.915
What the...?

1:05:37.184 --> 1:05:39.645
There. I vented.

1:05:41.188 --> 1:05:43.357
I know how it feels.

1:05:43.941 --> 1:05:47.361
When you like someone
who likes someone else

1:05:47.945 --> 1:05:50.864
it's hard to show your feelings.

1:05:51.281 --> 1:05:53.867
and you want to know
how that person feels

1:05:54.618 --> 1:06:00.707
and you like that person
so much that it hurts.

1:06:05.295 --> 1:06:06.880
Because...

1:06:10.467 --> 1:06:13.136
Because I feel that way too.

1:06:15.263 --> 1:06:16.807
So don't, okay?

1:06:17.808 --> 1:06:23.188
Don't say I don't understand
how you feel!

1:06:39.246 --> 1:06:42.082
Even teachers can't
bring mobiles?

1:06:42.457 --> 1:06:44.126
No. It's the rule.

1:06:44.501 --> 1:06:48.171
Are teachers going to
get suspended too?

1:06:48.588 --> 1:06:50.590
That's the rule.

1:06:50.841 --> 1:06:53.510
Mr. Saito, please come here.

1:06:53.635 --> 1:06:55.387
Yes, Vice Principal?

1:06:55.512 --> 1:06:57.931
May I speak to you
in private?

1:07:04.187 --> 1:07:06.273
Good morning, Natsuki.

1:07:07.357 --> 1:07:09.192
When someone breaks
the rule...

1:07:09.276 --> 1:07:13.196
I'm disappointed you
ignored my warning.

1:07:14.197 --> 1:07:19.202
I waited because
he likes you and Kenji

1:07:19.286 --> 1:07:22.039
but I find it hard to understand.

1:07:22.164 --> 1:07:24.750
What did you do to
Jinno and Kondo?

1:07:24.875 --> 1:07:29.796
They're staying home. That's why
we're helping the council.

1:07:37.721 --> 1:07:41.892
You're not as perceptive
as I thought you were.

1:07:41.975 --> 1:07:45.395
Many people without the
power are cooperative.

1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:50.609
Like the vice principal. He's very
sympathetic with what we're doing.

1:07:51.068 --> 1:07:55.822
So we're making proposals to
make this a better school.

1:08:12.089 --> 1:08:15.842
Whoa... People can be so cruel.

1:08:21.765 --> 1:08:23.266
Ouch...

1:08:24.893 --> 1:08:26.144
Natsuki...

1:08:26.937 --> 1:08:29.523
People are watching.

1:08:47.124 --> 1:08:47.958
Natsuki...

1:08:48.625 --> 1:08:49.793
Get off.

1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:53.130
We have to climb the stairs.

1:08:54.714 --> 1:08:58.051
Um... Listen...

1:08:58.468 --> 1:09:01.304
I can feel your breasts.

1:09:04.975 --> 1:09:06.226
Pervert.

1:09:06.309 --> 1:09:07.978
Whatever.

1:09:08.103 --> 1:09:10.355
You like Kaho.

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:11.898
Whatever.

1:09:11.982 --> 1:09:13.692
You don't care who, right?

1:09:13.817 --> 1:09:15.152
Give me a break.

1:09:15.235 --> 1:09:17.571
And you?
You don't care either?

1:09:19.823 --> 1:09:21.158
Sorry.

1:09:21.408 --> 1:09:24.119
Wear these.
Your feet are bleeding.

1:09:25.328 --> 1:09:27.914
What a tough
first day back.

1:09:28.081 --> 1:09:29.749
And tomorrow?

1:09:30.250 --> 1:09:31.042
How about you?

1:09:31.501 --> 1:09:32.335
Me?

1:09:32.419 --> 1:09:33.837
I'm going.

1:09:33.962 --> 1:09:34.796
Then I'll go.

1:09:46.933 --> 1:09:49.102
You shouldn't get too involved.

1:09:50.103 --> 1:09:52.689
Didn't one of my friends warn you?

1:09:54.858 --> 1:09:56.693
Why worry about me?

1:10:00.864 --> 1:10:05.785
People, when in a group, will
start a riot for small reasons.

1:10:05.869 --> 1:10:09.080
There's something
I want to ask you.

1:10:09.873 --> 1:10:11.374
You know everything.

1:10:12.209 --> 1:10:17.047
No, I don't. I don't know
what goes on in your mind.

1:10:17.130 --> 1:10:19.591
Because I don't
have the power?

1:10:25.472 --> 1:10:26.723
That's right.

1:10:29.893 --> 1:10:34.648
In the future, humankind doesn't
live on Earth anymore.

1:10:35.232 --> 1:10:36.233
What?

1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:41.488
People's behavior exceeded
the limit of Earth's endurance.

1:10:42.072 --> 1:10:44.491
Humans can't live on it anymore.

1:10:44.908 --> 1:10:46.868
So we live on the moon.

1:10:48.912 --> 1:10:51.831
See? That's my homeland.

1:10:52.499 --> 1:10:54.417
It feels so bizarre.

1:10:54.542 --> 1:10:58.129
Looking up at the moon from Earth.

1:11:00.257 --> 1:11:03.677
<i>It happened one day</i>
<i>without warning.</i>

1:11:04.344 --> 1:11:08.515
<i>Only a spaceship that was</i>
<i>away from Earth survived.</i>

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:14.604
<i>We discovered Earth needed</i>
<i>1,000 years to become livable again.</i>

1:11:15.438 --> 1:11:19.276
<i>We didn't have the technology</i>
<i>nor the resources</i>

1:11:19.359 --> 1:11:21.403
<i>to survive so many years.</i>

1:11:24.447 --> 1:11:27.784
<i>Humans will never</i>
<i>return to Earth.</i>

1:11:31.288 --> 1:11:33.206
Time passed.

1:11:33.456 --> 1:11:37.627
Some children started
displaying a strange ability.

1:11:38.128 --> 1:11:40.046
A psychic power?

1:11:40.130 --> 1:11:43.091
That's what you call it.

1:11:43.174 --> 1:11:47.387
Most areas of the human brain
are dormant most of the time.

1:11:48.138 --> 1:11:52.642
An unfamiliar power could be
awakened in a crisis.

1:11:53.518 --> 1:11:55.312
That's what some believe.

1:11:58.815 --> 1:12:01.318
<i>Nobody knows for sure.</i>

1:12:01.401 --> 1:12:06.489
<i>But in our era, this is</i>
<i>none other than hope.</i>

1:12:06.614 --> 1:12:07.657
<i>Hope?</i>

1:12:07.782 --> 1:12:13.663
<i>Yeah. People probably can't</i>
<i>stand not doing anything.</i>

1:12:14.164 --> 1:12:17.500
<i>We need hope to stay alive.</i>

1:12:19.085 --> 1:12:22.672
<i>The power is awakened</i>
<i>around the age of 14.</i>

1:12:24.090 --> 1:12:28.178
<i>Around the time when you first</i>
<i>start feeling self-conscious</i>

1:12:28.303 --> 1:12:31.139
<i>or confused and anguished</i>
<i>about relationships.</i>

1:12:31.348 --> 1:12:33.516
<i>The two periods</i>
<i>might be related.</i>

1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:37.854
<i>Some say this power</i>
<i>could prevent conflict.</i>

1:12:38.021 --> 1:12:44.194
<i>My mission is to awaken as many</i>
<i>power users as possible in this era.</i>

1:12:45.695 --> 1:12:49.699
<i>That way, we may be able</i>
<i>to prevent that disaster.</i>

1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:54.954
If not, I have to bring back
power users to my era.

1:12:56.539 --> 1:13:01.294
In my era, human population
is very small.

1:13:01.544 --> 1:13:04.381
Even a smaller population
of power users.

1:13:05.215 --> 1:13:08.385
We fight those who
stand in our way.

1:13:09.552 --> 1:13:12.597
Even if it's you or Kenji...

1:13:13.515 --> 1:13:14.933
<i>Or anyone else.</i>

1:13:17.102 --> 1:13:22.065
<i>So if this is "A Midsummer</i>
<i>Night's Dream " I'm Puck.</i>

1:13:23.066 --> 1:13:26.069
I'm here to put a magic
spell on humans.

1:13:30.198 --> 1:13:32.033
Why are you telling me?

1:13:36.121 --> 1:13:37.414
I...

1:13:39.249 --> 1:13:41.835
I don't know what to do.

1:13:57.225 --> 1:14:01.271
Sometimes fairies fall
in love with humans.

1:14:02.313 --> 1:14:05.024
You know a story like that?

1:14:07.444 --> 1:14:12.532
Or maybe I put a spell on myself.

1:14:14.284 --> 1:14:16.953
Puck is a prankster after all.

1:14:18.788 --> 1:14:21.624
<i>I'll count to three.</i>

1:14:21.708 --> 1:14:25.044
<i>And when I clap my hands</i>

1:14:25.128 --> 1:14:30.425
<i>you</i> ¢ <i>Il forget everything and</i>
<i>wake up feeling refreshed.</i>

1:14:30.884 --> 1:14:34.596
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

1:14:34.679 --> 1:14:35.722
<i>Now!</i>

1:14:44.481 --> 1:14:46.816
<i>If this is a magic spell...</i>

1:14:47.984 --> 1:14:52.322
<i>I don't want it to end.</i>

1:15:06.169 --> 1:15:09.672
<i>My mother was born in this era.</i>

1:15:11.841 --> 1:15:13.927
<i>I have no recollection of her.</i>

1:15:14.010 --> 1:15:17.847
<i>They say she died right</i>
<i>after I was born.</i>

1:15:19.766 --> 1:15:21.184
<i>No photographs of her.</i>

1:15:22.519 --> 1:15:24.395
<i>Record of the past are worthless.</i>

1:15:24.521 --> 1:15:28.816
<i>What's important is the future.</i>
<i>That's what my father believes.</i>

1:15:31.528 --> 1:15:36.616
<i>Still a few of my mother's</i>
<i>belongings were left behind.</i>

1:15:37.992 --> 1:15:40.328
<i>Secretly looking at them</i>

1:15:40.620 --> 1:15:45.166
<i>was my private, childhood pastime.</i>

1:15:54.133 --> 1:15:55.343
<i>Kaho, come!</i>

1:15:55.635 --> 1:15:57.428
Natsuki's in trouble!

1:16:01.140 --> 1:16:03.851
You can't just
open my locker.

1:16:03.935 --> 1:16:09.399
Natsuki Suzuura, you are
suspended for 10 days.

1:16:09.482 --> 1:16:14.070
The next time, 30 days.
The third time, 90 days.

1:16:14.195 --> 1:16:15.029
Give it back.

1:16:15.113 --> 1:16:16.656
Let go of it.

1:16:16.739 --> 1:16:18.074
Stop it.

1:16:18.199 --> 1:16:19.284
Give it back!

1:16:24.664 --> 1:16:26.916
I can walk by myself!

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:29.752
Go! Faster!

1:16:30.253 --> 1:16:31.671
Let me get changed!

1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:38.469
Come on!

1:16:38.595 --> 1:16:39.512
Go!

1:16:39.596 --> 1:16:41.222
You can do it!

1:16:41.598 --> 1:16:43.600
Let go of me!

1:16:45.268 --> 1:16:46.686
Are you sure?

1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:51.190
My father wants to release
Kenji's power, doesn't he?

1:16:54.611 --> 1:16:58.031
Is he still trying?

1:16:58.197 --> 1:16:59.616
Go on.

1:17:00.366 --> 1:17:02.368
To your master.

1:17:05.955 --> 1:17:10.627
<i>The one who decides how to use</i>
<i>the power is not me nor you.</i>

1:17:10.710 --> 1:17:12.962
<i>Tell that to your father.</i>

1:17:13.755 --> 1:17:16.758
Tell him to leave
the past alone.

1:17:17.467 --> 1:17:19.510
Why are mobile phones forbidden?

1:17:20.136 --> 1:17:22.388
I'm coming to school tomorrow.

1:17:23.806 --> 1:17:25.558
I promised.

1:17:25.808 --> 1:17:29.228
I don't understand
what you're saying.

1:17:29.312 --> 1:17:34.108
Forgive me for not being able
to use telepathy like you.

1:17:34.317 --> 1:17:38.571
Why don't you forbid talking
and listening too?

1:17:38.655 --> 1:17:39.656
What's your point?

1:17:39.781 --> 1:17:43.201
You just want to pretend
to know the answer.

1:17:43.326 --> 1:17:45.995
Reading people's minds?

1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:48.081
That's like peeping.

1:17:48.498 --> 1:17:53.252
Wanting to tell, wanting to know...
That's what counts.

1:17:53.336 --> 1:17:55.672
Peeping?
How dare you!

1:17:55.797 --> 1:18:00.385
If you don't want to tell your
feelings, they'll never get through.

1:18:00.510 --> 1:18:04.681
People who don't want to
understand won't understand.

1:18:05.139 --> 1:18:08.351
It's not about mobile phones
or telepathy.

1:18:08.643 --> 1:18:10.478
It's necessary in the future.

1:18:10.561 --> 1:18:15.066
I don't care about the future!
We're living in the present!

1:18:15.191 --> 1:18:17.485
Shut up if you're
not going to fight.

1:18:18.069 --> 1:18:19.529
It's people like you...

1:18:19.612 --> 1:18:22.699
You're the one
who's not fighting.

1:18:44.887 --> 1:18:48.641
What? We had swimming.

1:18:49.767 --> 1:18:53.771
A mobile?
I brought mine too.

1:19:06.117 --> 1:19:08.244
Are you gonna
confiscate it too?

1:19:12.999 --> 1:19:15.251
<i>What was my mother like?</i>

1:19:15.376 --> 1:19:17.920
<i>Don't you use telepathy?</i>

1:19:18.755 --> 1:19:22.008
I want to hear it said
in your words.

1:19:23.843 --> 1:19:27.430
All right.
She was a beautiful woman.

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:29.557
You two look alike.

1:19:29.932 --> 1:19:31.684
So I've been told.

1:19:32.435 --> 1:19:35.855
She had her own beliefs.

1:19:35.938 --> 1:19:39.942
To tell you the truth,
I had a crush on her.

1:19:41.027 --> 1:19:44.781
I hoped she'd be
happy in the future.

1:19:45.698 --> 1:19:48.326
Do you think she was happy?

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:54.874
I was hoping you'd tell me.

1:20:01.798 --> 1:20:05.009
Wait, Kenji! Wait!

1:20:21.818 --> 1:20:23.986
I'm going now.

1:20:24.487 --> 1:20:25.488
All right.

1:20:27.657 --> 1:20:29.826
What are you going to do?

1:20:30.493 --> 1:20:31.953
About what?

1:20:32.036 --> 1:20:35.581
Half of your blood
is from this era.

1:20:37.250 --> 1:20:40.711
Couldn't you stay and
live in this era?

1:20:48.177 --> 1:20:53.266
I think people are happiest living
in the era they were born in.

1:20:53.766 --> 1:20:57.687
I was sure you'd say that.

1:20:59.188 --> 1:21:00.648
You're right.

1:21:01.524 --> 1:21:04.443
<i>It was a stupid question.</i>

1:21:16.539 --> 1:21:18.624
You hold it, you pervert!

1:21:19.333 --> 1:21:21.252
Where are you putting it?

1:21:21.377 --> 1:21:23.880
The only pocket is in here.

1:21:24.005 --> 1:21:25.840
Give me mine!

1:21:25.923 --> 1:21:27.425
Okay, fine.

1:21:27.550 --> 1:21:30.970
No! That's not a pocket!

1:21:34.140 --> 1:21:37.685
I told you you're a psychic.

1:21:38.102 --> 1:21:40.563
Yeah. It seems so.

1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:43.399
Let's finish this.

1:21:43.900 --> 1:21:46.485
This is our fate.

1:21:49.155 --> 1:21:51.157
Hey, you know what?

1:21:51.824 --> 1:21:53.659
Tomorrow's the weekend.

1:21:55.328 --> 1:21:56.245
So?

1:21:56.370 --> 1:21:58.122
Wanna go to the beach?

1:22:04.754 --> 1:22:05.671
Huh?

1:22:13.012 --> 1:22:16.015
<i>The typhoon that</i>
<i>developed on the 4th</i>

1:22:16.098 --> 1:22:19.435
<i>traveled over the</i>
<i>Ogasawara Islands</i>

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:25.316
<i>and is moving southeast 200 km</i>
<i>off the shores of Chichijima...</i>

1:22:28.903 --> 1:22:32.406
Don't you have any common sense?

1:22:33.157 --> 1:22:36.744
Why are we at the beach
in this weather?

1:22:36.827 --> 1:22:38.162
Why not?
It's summer.

1:22:38.287 --> 1:22:40.206
But...!

1:22:40.289 --> 1:22:41.916
It <i>is</i> summer.

1:22:43.292 --> 1:22:46.128
I feel like a worry wart.

1:22:46.629 --> 1:22:48.589
It'll be sunny later.

1:22:48.965 --> 1:22:52.468
That really wasn't my point.

1:22:52.551 --> 1:22:54.804
Hey... I brought the script.

1:22:54.929 --> 1:22:55.930
The play?

1:22:56.013 --> 1:22:57.181
Let's practice.

1:22:57.306 --> 1:22:58.057
Yeah, let's.

1:22:58.140 --> 1:22:58.849
You're kidding.

1:22:58.975 --> 1:23:01.727
I brought lunch.
Which first?

1:23:01.811 --> 1:23:04.271
I didn't know you
were so adaptable.

1:23:04.355 --> 1:23:05.523
I say lunch!

1:23:05.648 --> 1:23:07.400
Natsuki made lunch
for you.

1:23:08.985 --> 1:23:10.987
Don't be rude.

1:23:11.070 --> 1:23:12.947
I might pass out.

1:23:13.030 --> 1:23:15.825
Rude? Pass out?

1:23:15.908 --> 1:23:17.243
I was just...

1:23:17.326 --> 1:23:19.537
Let's all eat together.

1:23:30.339 --> 1:23:32.425
You guys! You're kidding.

1:23:53.779 --> 1:23:56.449
Sorry to make you
worry all the time.

1:23:58.034 --> 1:23:59.201
Who are you?

1:23:59.702 --> 1:24:01.203
Kenji is...

1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:04.040
That's me.
I died that day.

1:24:07.626 --> 1:24:12.006
But you slipped back in time
and got hurt in my place

1:24:12.590 --> 1:24:14.341
and lost the power.

1:24:15.051 --> 1:24:20.389
When you change something,
something else changes for balance.

1:24:25.978 --> 1:24:27.897
Take care.

1:24:28.898 --> 1:24:30.316
Are you going somewhere?

1:24:30.399 --> 1:24:33.110
Wait! Stop!

1:24:37.573 --> 1:24:40.910
Don't go! You promised!

1:24:41.911 --> 1:24:47.833
We're always going to stay
next to each other, aren't we?

1:24:49.418 --> 1:24:51.170
<i>Liar.</i>

1:24:52.922 --> 1:24:55.132
Don't go!

1:24:56.759 --> 1:24:57.927
<i>Kenji...</i>

1:24:58.052 --> 1:24:59.929
You promised.

1:25:00.304 --> 1:25:00.930
<i>Kenji...</i>

1:25:01.013 --> 1:25:03.390
You said so yourself.

1:25:03.766 --> 1:25:07.770
You said we'll always
stay next to each other.

1:25:11.774 --> 1:25:13.359
<i>Kenji...</i>

1:25:16.445 --> 1:25:17.863
<i>You jerk.</i>

1:25:20.032 --> 1:25:21.367
<i>Jerk...</i>

1:25:33.838 --> 1:25:35.714
The sun came out.

1:25:37.466 --> 1:25:40.970
Was I saying something?

1:25:47.726 --> 1:25:49.979
You know now.

1:25:51.147 --> 1:25:55.317
Actually I've known for a long time.

1:25:56.569 --> 1:25:58.154
Since when?

1:25:58.279 --> 1:26:03.200
You came to school every day
because of Kenji.

1:26:03.993 --> 1:26:06.662
I realized how much
you like him.

1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.711
But Kenji likes you, Kaho.

1:26:16.755 --> 1:26:18.507
It's not fair.

1:26:19.091 --> 1:26:21.927
I liked him first.

1:26:23.012 --> 1:26:24.513
For so long...

1:26:27.183 --> 1:26:29.101
I've liked him.

1:26:29.435 --> 1:26:31.353
For so long...

1:26:32.104 --> 1:26:34.190
It's not fair.

1:26:42.448 --> 1:26:46.202
So your dad knew my grandpa?

1:26:47.286 --> 1:26:48.954
They weren't friends.

1:26:49.788 --> 1:26:54.460
When my dad came to this era,
your grandpa got in his way.

1:26:54.793 --> 1:26:56.795
Why didn't he come with you?

1:26:56.879 --> 1:26:59.757
You can time travel only once.

1:26:59.882 --> 1:27:02.051
It's bad for the heart.

1:27:03.135 --> 1:27:05.721
I sense his presence sometimes.

1:27:06.722 --> 1:27:08.057
You do?

1:27:09.308 --> 1:27:10.309
You do, huh?

1:27:13.812 --> 1:27:15.231
I'll get you back!

1:27:19.235 --> 1:27:22.279
I've come to like acting.

1:27:22.613 --> 1:27:23.489
Yeah?

1:27:23.989 --> 1:27:26.909
It's nice talking like this.

1:27:27.910 --> 1:27:29.745
Talking is acting?

1:27:29.828 --> 1:27:32.748
Because you don't let
me read your mind.

1:27:33.249 --> 1:27:36.669
Your power is stronger
than mine by far.

1:27:36.919 --> 1:27:41.006
Like the sun and the moon.
That's why it's a one-way street.

1:27:42.174 --> 1:27:45.302
You can't see moonlight
during the day.

1:27:46.303 --> 1:27:49.515
Even though the moon
is out during the day.

1:27:49.932 --> 1:27:52.601
What's taking you guys so long?

1:28:11.996 --> 1:28:16.000
Oh my God... This is scary.

1:28:16.125 --> 1:28:18.043
Really scary!

1:28:21.964 --> 1:28:24.550
Ouch!

1:28:24.633 --> 1:28:25.592
Here we go.

1:28:25.884 --> 1:28:28.304
Get closer.

1:28:38.772 --> 1:28:40.816
<i>So this is summer.</i>

1:28:41.191 --> 1:28:44.320
<i>Oh... You don't have the seasons.</i>

1:28:44.653 --> 1:28:45.696
<i>No.</i>

1:28:49.408 --> 1:28:51.577
<i>In "A Midsummer Night's Dream"</i>

1:28:51.869 --> 1:28:56.498
<i>they forget their dreams</i>
<i>when they wake up, right?</i>

1:28:56.999 --> 1:28:58.792
<i>Why? Suddenly...</i>

1:28:59.001 --> 1:29:01.420
<i>It's like hypnosis.</i>

1:29:01.837 --> 1:29:02.963
<i>But...</i>

1:29:05.299 --> 1:29:09.970
If you fall in love
under a magic spell...

1:29:12.723 --> 1:29:16.352
When you wake up from the spell

1:29:16.894 --> 1:29:20.689
and if that love you felt
in the dream disappears

1:29:21.690 --> 1:29:26.445
where does that feeling of love go?

1:29:31.575 --> 1:29:35.537
I have to go back to the moon.

1:29:36.246 --> 1:29:39.458
Go back? When?

1:29:40.042 --> 1:29:42.378
Tonight, I think.

1:29:44.296 --> 1:29:47.925
Then you'll probably forget about me.

1:29:48.967 --> 1:29:51.053
Like "A Midsummer Night's Dream."

1:29:53.305 --> 1:29:56.642
This is full already.

1:29:56.892 --> 1:29:58.310
Full?

1:29:58.519 --> 1:30:01.939
Full to the top with time.

1:30:02.856 --> 1:30:06.819
With the several months
that I've been gone.

1:30:11.031 --> 1:30:16.078
<i>Goodbye. I wish I could have</i>
<i>listened to your "Moonlight."</i>

1:30:22.793 --> 1:30:26.964
Puck is such a prankster
but a lovable one.

1:30:27.089 --> 1:30:29.341
What are you talking about?

1:30:29.425 --> 1:30:31.385
He's probably serious.

1:30:32.010 --> 1:30:34.096
Playing pranks aren't nice.

1:30:34.221 --> 1:30:36.014
We don't know
what he's thinking.

1:30:36.765 --> 1:30:38.976
<i>What goes on in</i>
<i>fairies' minds...</i>

1:30:46.608 --> 1:30:48.277
Don't go.

1:30:49.695 --> 1:30:51.864
I have to.

1:30:51.947 --> 1:30:53.574
I like you so much.

1:30:54.533 --> 1:30:56.952
Really, I do.

1:30:59.246 --> 1:31:02.124
I could never forget you.

1:31:03.375 --> 1:31:04.877
If you're going...

1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:06.003
No.

1:31:06.128 --> 1:31:08.464
If you're going, then...

1:31:08.547 --> 1:31:09.798
No!

1:31:13.886 --> 1:31:15.262
I'll...

1:31:18.390 --> 1:31:20.601
I'll go with you.

1:31:26.482 --> 1:31:27.900
Let's go.

1:31:28.317 --> 1:31:29.651
Go where?

1:31:29.735 --> 1:31:30.819
Get on.

1:31:30.944 --> 1:31:36.116
Without you, there'll be nothing
to keep me in this era.

1:31:38.327 --> 1:31:39.286
What?

1:31:41.288 --> 1:31:42.498
I won't repeat it.

1:31:42.623 --> 1:31:44.458
What did you say?

1:31:44.541 --> 1:31:45.167
Come on.

1:31:45.250 --> 1:31:47.252
Say it again, meanie.

1:31:51.507 --> 1:31:52.841
Sorry.

1:31:58.347 --> 1:32:02.351
My mother was from this era.

1:32:03.519 --> 1:32:06.605
When she came to the future

1:32:07.022 --> 1:32:10.192
she was probably lonely,
very lonely.

1:32:29.169 --> 1:32:30.420
Goodbye.

1:33:05.747 --> 1:33:06.790
Hey.

1:33:09.960 --> 1:33:11.128
You alone?

1:33:11.461 --> 1:33:12.462
Yeah.

1:33:13.255 --> 1:33:14.590
I see.

1:33:21.513 --> 1:33:24.433
I came to see you off.

1:33:24.558 --> 1:33:25.934
When you leave...

1:33:27.769 --> 1:33:29.229
I'll break this.

1:33:31.273 --> 1:33:33.734
I can't allow that.

1:33:50.792 --> 1:33:52.961
I don't want to fight you.

1:33:53.086 --> 1:33:55.422
You won't exist in
this world anymore.

1:33:55.505 --> 1:33:58.050
It's okay.
It's my mission.

1:34:35.671 --> 1:34:39.424
Ryoichi, get rid of them.
Get their power!

1:34:40.008 --> 1:34:43.929
Then the future will change.
Humankind will survive.

1:34:44.012 --> 1:34:46.181
Survive and then what?

1:34:46.264 --> 1:34:47.307
What?

1:34:48.016 --> 1:34:51.853
A past that has no
future won't change.

1:34:52.854 --> 1:34:54.022
We've done enough.

1:34:54.106 --> 1:34:57.526
You fool. Your theory is wrong.

1:34:57.651 --> 1:35:02.114
Why? I know you
already know... Dad.

1:35:04.408 --> 1:35:10.414
Because you couldn't
return Mom to this era.

1:35:13.542 --> 1:35:16.211
You have me.

1:35:17.546 --> 1:35:21.007
Me, who's not supposed to exist.

1:35:29.599 --> 1:35:30.308
No!

1:35:31.393 --> 1:35:34.563
Why? Earth...

1:35:36.064 --> 1:35:39.401
Why does it keep rejecting us?

1:36:04.676 --> 1:36:06.344
<i>It's like snow.</i>

1:36:09.347 --> 1:36:13.852
<i>Wait... Have I ever seen snow?</i>

1:36:16.855 --> 1:36:21.276
<i>Ah... It must be from the stories</i>
<i>Mom told me</i>

1:36:21.443 --> 1:36:24.279
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

1:36:26.615 --> 1:36:27.365
Kenji!

1:36:27.449 --> 1:36:30.786
You used up your power
knowing this would happen.

1:36:30.911 --> 1:36:33.997
Go away...
You'll get drawn in too.

1:36:34.456 --> 1:36:38.877
<i>Kyogoku, your and my</i>
<i>hearts aren't connected.</i>

1:36:40.128 --> 1:36:42.964
But our hands can connect.

1:36:44.132 --> 1:36:45.717
Isn't that good enough?

1:36:46.718 --> 1:36:51.139
<i>Your hands are warm.</i>
<i>I can feel your heat.</i>

1:36:51.473 --> 1:36:53.225
Isn't that good enough?

1:37:22.087 --> 1:37:24.047
Kenji!

1:37:27.092 --> 1:37:28.093
Huh?

1:37:31.179 --> 1:37:33.682
What are you doing?

1:37:34.099 --> 1:37:37.769
I told you I came
to see you off.

1:37:37.853 --> 1:37:42.148
I can't exist in this era anymore.

1:37:42.566 --> 1:37:45.861
I can't go back.
I'll disappear soon.

1:37:45.986 --> 1:37:47.779
I'll take you.

1:37:48.697 --> 1:37:51.449
I can manage a
one-way trip.

1:37:51.741 --> 1:37:54.744
Don't be stupid.
You'll be stuck.

1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:56.788
Kyogoku...

1:37:57.706 --> 1:38:00.500
Nobody is "not supposed to exist."

1:38:01.877 --> 1:38:07.549
You still exist here because there
are people who want you here.

1:38:08.884 --> 1:38:12.053
Me... You...

1:38:12.637 --> 1:38:16.683
Maybe everybody.

1:38:23.982 --> 1:38:26.359
Maybe you're right.

1:38:29.237 --> 1:38:30.780
Sorry, Natsuki.

1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:34.159
I'll be right back.

1:38:34.242 --> 1:38:36.036
Where are you going?

1:38:36.119 --> 1:38:37.746
Wait for me.

1:38:37.954 --> 1:38:40.040
You want me to wait?

1:38:41.833 --> 1:38:42.918
Yeah.

1:38:43.043 --> 1:38:44.502
If...

1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:47.422
If I was born in this era

1:38:47.756 --> 1:38:49.424
we could have been...

1:38:49.507 --> 1:38:51.092
Shut up.

1:38:52.928 --> 1:38:57.349
The you I know was our friend.

1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:01.269
No matter how many
light years we're apart

1:39:01.937 --> 1:39:03.772
that won't change.

1:39:22.707 --> 1:39:23.959
Kenji!

1:39:53.738 --> 1:39:55.198
Kenji?

1:39:59.202 --> 1:40:01.162
What was I doing?

1:40:09.379 --> 1:40:11.339
Kenji...

1:40:15.093 --> 1:40:16.761
Who's that?

1:44:44.487 --> 1:44:45.989
Did you hear?

1:44:46.114 --> 1:44:46.864
About what?

1:44:46.948 --> 1:44:49.242
The new student.

1:44:49.659 --> 1:44:51.286
New student?

1:45:01.170 --> 1:45:02.839
I don't know this number.

1:45:09.345 --> 1:45:13.057
Will you please answer
your mobile?

1:45:18.354 --> 1:45:21.065
That's weird...

1:45:21.316 --> 1:45:25.653
This was supposed to make
you remember me.

1:45:41.836 --> 1:45:43.296
Jerk...

1:45:48.009 --> 1:45:49.177
Natsuki?

1:45:49.635 --> 1:45:50.803
You're a jerk!

1:45:56.726 --> 1:45:58.186
I'm back.

1:46:00.897 --> 1:46:02.273
<i>Jerk.</i>
