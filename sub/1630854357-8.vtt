WEBVTT

00:07.048 --> 00:08.049
Do you know where
they were headed?

00:08.049 --> 00:09.342
Could you tell?
That's him.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.511
The girl that
Bishop Paulsen saw.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.763
It was someone
else's daughter.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.223
You could've stopped it.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.641
He had repented.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.019
<i>Thought I was doing
the right thing.</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:20.520
Her mother passed tragically.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.022
Well, we're proud
to support the work

00:22.022 --> 00:24.524
you do for the White House
in any way we can, Mr. Tobler.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.109
You take care
of my Janice now.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.904
You need to get him talking
and let him lead us to her.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.866
<i>It is pure hell, Mary Ann,
not knowing where she is.</i>

00:32.866 --> 00:35.326
<i>Oh, just thinking about all
the awful things that might</i>

00:35.326 --> 00:37.078
<i>be happening to her out there.</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:40.582
You are an evil man.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.292
Evil.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.182
Anything you want.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.728
Yeah, I'll take a hot dog.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.146
A hot dog?

01:45.146 --> 01:47.440
Anything in the world,
and you wanna have a hot dog.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.234
Okay. Don't tell your mother.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.319
What are you gonna put on it?

02:01.913 --> 02:05.250
Now, you wait here,
and I'll be back in a jiff.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.710
All right?
- All right.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.169
All right.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.981
Hello? Brobergs.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.607
<i>- Hi, Mary Ann.</i>

02:31.026 --> 02:33.611
Hiya, B.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.697
It's nice to hear your voice.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.991
I think you'd be even happier
when you hear why I'm calling.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.160
Oh, is that right?

02:40.160 --> 02:45.206
A contact of mine spotted
Jan across state lines,

02:45.206 --> 02:47.459
a real surprising
location for her.

02:47.459 --> 02:48.752
<i>Why should I believe</i>

02:48.752 --> 02:50.337
<i>a single word
out of your mouth?</i>

02:50.337 --> 02:54.090
<i>You'll listen 'cause you'll
have nothing if you don't.</i>

02:54.090 --> 02:56.343
Now...

02:56.343 --> 03:00.430
I'll tell you everything,
but only in person,

03:00.430 --> 03:02.766
'cause I know these lines
can be tapped,

03:02.766 --> 03:05.185
and I don't want my words
being twisted against me.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.437
They're not tapped.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.230
<i>Oh, sure they are.</i>

03:09.230 --> 03:11.191
You've got a recording device
right there next to you

03:11.191 --> 03:13.360
in the kitchen.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.862
Did Gail tell you that?

03:15.862 --> 03:17.864
<i>You never mind that,
Mary Ann.</i>

03:17.864 --> 03:20.283
You just come in person.

03:20.283 --> 03:24.079
And you come alone,
no police, no Bob.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.663
<i>I've had about enough of him.</i>

03:25.663 --> 03:27.707
That's a lot of conditions.

03:27.707 --> 03:31.503
Well, I'm doing you a favor
telling you everything I know.

03:31.503 --> 03:34.214
And I need to feel like
there's a little trust.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.674
Of course, there is.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.388
What do you say we meet
at the Crossroads Cafe

03:41.388 --> 03:43.181
near Ogden City?

03:43.181 --> 03:45.934
Noon on Saturday.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.852
That's a week away.
Why not sooner?

03:47.852 --> 03:49.312
<i>Well, I'm busy.</i>

03:49.312 --> 03:51.439
I'm scouring the Earth
trying to find Jan.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.692
<i>You said you
knew where she was.</i>

03:53.692 --> 03:55.360
And I know you can't
leave the state

03:55.360 --> 03:56.528
because of your parole.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.154
<i>Mary Ann, Mary Ann,</i>

03:58.154 --> 04:00.198
the only thing
that matters to me

04:00.198 --> 04:02.200
is finding Jan.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.787
If that doesn't work for you,
then we don't have to meet.

04:13.628 --> 04:17.132
<i>Crossroads Cafe, Saturday.</i>

05:17.942 --> 05:19.611
Give me strength.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.490
Give me strength.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.119
Give me--
- Janice?

05:29.913 --> 05:31.706
Are you OK?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.795
I heard you
the last few nights.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.505
And...

05:38.505 --> 05:41.591
it sounded like
you were crying.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.677
I wasn't crying.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.055
You miss Lebanon?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.687
I miss where I'm from
before that.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.401
And I miss my family.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.782
I used to act in all
the school plays.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.494
So I miss that.

06:14.624 --> 06:18.545
There's this play
at the boys' school.

06:20.130 --> 06:24.592
I wanted to audition,
but I was too shy to go alone.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.434
It's "As You Like It"
by Shakespeare.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.855
I can't talk to boys.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.565
Says who?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.191
We're at boarding school.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.158
Beautiful car.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.617
How you doin'?

06:51.995 --> 06:53.580
Hey.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.623
Hey, can I help you?

06:55.623 --> 06:58.418
<i>- * Some people run ♪</i>

06:58.418 --> 06:59.919
What the hell are you doing?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.422
<i>- * Some people crawl ♪</i>

07:02.422 --> 07:03.631
Whew.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.802
Thanks for holding this for me.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.722
Bob, you know you can
count on me

07:10.722 --> 07:12.349
when you're down on your luck,
but that don't mean

07:12.349 --> 07:14.601
you can store guns
on my lot now.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.229
Well...

07:18.229 --> 07:20.106
I asked you before
if I could store it here.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.274
You said yes.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.276
I don't remember that.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.903
Maybe you're losing it, Joe.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.572
I got the FBI
calling me again,

07:27.572 --> 07:29.908
asking if I know where Jan is.

07:29.908 --> 07:30.992
Yeah.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.912
You know, as a matter of fact--

07:33.912 --> 07:35.622
- I don't wanna know.
- No, no, no, no.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.998
No. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.541
Joe. Joe.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.294
There's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.088
I wanted to say thank you.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.967
For when you turned me
and Jan in,

07:47.967 --> 07:49.219
in Mexico.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.847
At the time I was angry.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.810
In the end, I'm just grateful,
you know?

07:56.810 --> 07:59.729
Because we're in a much better
place now.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.816
All those obstacles,
I think they brought us closer.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.860
You know, I feel like we really
know each other now

08:05.860 --> 08:07.821
as lovers

08:07.821 --> 08:10.865
and also as friends, you know?

08:10.865 --> 08:12.075
As--

08:13.368 --> 08:15.036
As partners.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.956
Bob, you get that girl
pregnant, you're screwed.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.583
Well, it's hardly an issue.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.669
I don't know where
she even is.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.592
Anyway, she ain't even
got her period yet, so--

08:33.013 --> 08:35.306
It's always good
seeing you, Joe.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.814
Hey, find somewhere else
to store your shit, Bob.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.108
I don't want nothing
to do with this.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.234
I'm done.

08:46.234 --> 08:49.195
Sure thing, toughie.
Whatever you say.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.882
Mary Ann.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.717
Detective George Shail,
Ogden Police.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.218
Sorry for the short notice.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.887
I appreciate you coming down.
- Of course.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.430
I'll do anything to help.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.015
We've been watching Berchtold

09:17.015 --> 09:18.850
since Agent Welsh put him
on our radar.

09:18.850 --> 09:22.354
A lot of us have
young children, so--

09:22.354 --> 09:24.230
What we need you to do

09:24.230 --> 09:27.150
is tell us if this is the girl
you saw with him.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.909
- Yes, that's her.
- All right.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.244
We'll show her a photo of Jan.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.122
Officer Jensen?

09:48.880 --> 09:52.801
Carly, do you
recognize this girl?

10:03.645 --> 10:04.854
Ma'am, what is your relationship

10:04.854 --> 10:06.439
to Robert Berchtold?

10:06.439 --> 10:08.525
Uh, is--

10:08.525 --> 10:10.735
is this because
of the Brobergs?

10:10.735 --> 10:14.489
Because I know all
about them, you know?

10:14.489 --> 10:18.660
They will not rest until his
life is ruined,

10:18.660 --> 10:20.954
no matter how many stories
they tell.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.831
It's really something.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.002
You know...

10:27.002 --> 10:29.504
Bob has his struggles.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.798
But he's a good man.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.717
He's always there
when I need him.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.927
He's helped me
in countless ways.

10:35.927 --> 10:40.306
And he's just been a complete
angel with my Carly.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.601
We just need to know what
your relationship is to him--

10:43.601 --> 10:46.730
friend, boyfriend?

10:48.106 --> 10:50.025
He's like a family member.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.653
What do you think
about Bob, honey?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.113
He's so much fun.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.824
We do everything together.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.659
He's my best friend.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.948
Thanks for coming right over.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.744
I am really not supposed
to be here right now.

11:43.620 --> 11:48.249
Mary Ann, you cannot
go see Berchtold by yourself.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.212
He's worried about
being recorded.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.714
If I go in person,
maybe he'll actually

11:54.714 --> 11:56.049
give us something we can use.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.384
The only thing that
he is worried about

11:57.384 --> 11:59.052
is getting a legal marriage
on the books

11:59.052 --> 12:01.054
to protect himself
from prosecution.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.931
He needs your consent.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.183
If you go and meet
him in person,

12:05.183 --> 12:07.644
he may use force to try to
get you to sign those papers.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.771
- It's a public place.
- Oh, Mary Ann, that's--

12:09.771 --> 12:12.482
My daughter is out there.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.612
I can't just wait.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.253
It's a personal piece.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.841
If you must go, take it.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.602
Mary Ann, it's for protection.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.731
Please, don't just shoot him.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.583
Hey there, movie star.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.084
Come on.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.630
Hi.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.765
OK, you ready?

13:26.765 --> 13:28.183
Come on.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.415
It's so nice to have
the whole day to ourselves.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.505
So how you doin', Dolly?

13:59.881 --> 14:01.675
I'm good.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.177
Oh, I get it.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.055
Well, we all get
the blues sometimes,

14:07.055 --> 14:08.765
even yours truly,

14:08.765 --> 14:10.684
shocking as that may be
to hear.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.852
But it's a beautiful day.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.647
So what are we gonna do next?

14:15.647 --> 14:20.068
Go to the Chinese Theater again
or Hollywood Wax Museum?

14:21.277 --> 14:24.406
Uh, I--I don't really
mind either.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.116
You can pick.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.326
What's with you? Huh?

14:31.079 --> 14:33.039
It's not the wrong time
of the month, is it?

14:34.874 --> 14:38.461
I still haven't gotten it,
if that's what you're asking.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.923
Good.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.260
Zeda and Zethra were concerned.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.469
So--

14:47.637 --> 14:50.765
They asked you about that?
How come?

14:50.765 --> 14:55.186
Well, if you don't get
your human period, then...

14:55.186 --> 14:57.564
you can't be pregnant.
- Oh.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.567
I haven't had one this entire
time and I'm not pregnant.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.028
Oh, exactly.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.404
Exactly what?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.031
Is that right for
a half-human like me?

15:06.031 --> 15:07.532
Uh, you know,

15:07.532 --> 15:10.160
biology's a whole other
ball game on their planet.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.912
So, you know,
I'm thinking wax museum.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.290
How do you know stuff
about biology on their planet?

15:15.290 --> 15:17.625
Zeda and Zethra talk
to me all the time.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.169
All the time?
When did that start?

15:19.169 --> 15:21.087
You know what?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.381
Dolly, I don't tell you
about all this stuff

15:23.381 --> 15:25.091
because it's traumatizing,
OK, and I don't

15:25.091 --> 15:27.302
want to burden you with it.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.387
So I bear it on my own.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.931
OK?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.309
- OK.
- OK.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.480
And don't bite your nails.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.482
You'll bite them
down to nothing.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.487
How about another
driving lesson, huh?

15:45.487 --> 15:46.654
Yeah, all right.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.406
Here we go.

15:49.699 --> 15:53.620
Uh-huh. Stay to the right,
stay to the right.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.872
Oh, that is great, Dolly.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.624
That is great.
You're a natural.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.087
This is a pretty neighborhood.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.463
Yeah.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.382
It looks different now
that I'm having fun.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.552
What do you mean different?

16:09.552 --> 16:11.012
Different from when?

16:12.180 --> 16:16.184
Oh, I don't know
what I'm talking about.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.815
When have you been
here before?

16:21.815 --> 16:24.943
Um, I--

16:24.943 --> 16:27.028
it wasn't a big deal.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.780
It was just an audition
for a play.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.198
A play?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.952
What kind of play?

16:33.952 --> 16:35.537
Just a school one.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.289
Shakespeare.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.793
So why wasn't
it on campus then?

16:43.962 --> 16:47.382
It was at a different school.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.386
A boys' school?

16:53.388 --> 16:54.848
Are you telling
me you auditioned

16:54.848 --> 16:56.391
for a play at a boys' school?

16:56.391 --> 16:58.351
I didn't even talk
to any of the boys.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.853
You expect me
to believe that?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.021
Well, B, it's true.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.230
Were you even
gonna tell me?

17:02.230 --> 17:03.606
You were at a school
with boys and men,

17:03.606 --> 17:04.566
and you think that's OK?

17:04.566 --> 17:05.775
You think it's OK
for the mission?

17:05.775 --> 17:07.986
I wasn't even the
one who wanted to go.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.405
You know, when you lie,
you don't just hurt me.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.907
You hurt your own soul.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.367
Stay to the right.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.703
And worst of all,
you hurt the mission.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.664
Do you even care about
the mission at all?

17:19.664 --> 17:21.708
Of course, I do.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.669
You know it's all that I think
about all day and all night.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.171
I can't even sleep.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.380
I'm doing everything
that they're asking--

17:27.380 --> 17:28.798

17:32.302 --> 17:35.138

17:55.283 --> 17:58.328
We're all OK.

17:58.328 --> 18:01.623
OK, well, you're [instinct].
- Yes, [indistinct].

18:01.623 --> 18:03.208
OK. Take care.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.630
Scoot over.
Move over.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.606
Do you think I have
to go to the hospital?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.400
No, I don't think you need
to go to the hospital.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.193
It's a bump on the noggin.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.904
And even if it was worse,
I couldn't take you.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.948
You know that, right?

18:34.948 --> 18:36.324
I just--

18:36.324 --> 18:37.742
I feel kinda dizzy.

18:37.742 --> 18:41.079
Well, thanks to Mary Ann
and Bob's treachery,

18:41.079 --> 18:42.414
we're not even safe
where we are.

18:42.414 --> 18:45.333
If a cop had driven by--

18:45.333 --> 18:47.961
You know, thanks
to your parents and my parole,

18:47.961 --> 18:49.629
I can't leave Utah.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.383
So a hospital record
in the state of California,

18:53.383 --> 18:55.135
that sends me right back
to jail.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.803
And then where would we be?

18:56.803 --> 18:58.346
And I told you to watch
the road, didn't I?

18:58.346 --> 19:00.306
I told you to watch the road!

19:12.861 --> 19:14.738
And what if I'd lost you?

19:18.533 --> 19:20.535
I'm really sorry.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.748
I didn't mean to upset you.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.834
You're my angel
on this Earth, Dolly.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.128
Here you are, hurt,
and you're worried about me.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.721
You know, I didn't wanna
have to tell you this,

19:39.721 --> 19:42.098
but...

19:42.098 --> 19:44.267
the reason that Zeda and Zethra
have been contacting me

19:44.267 --> 19:45.727
is 'cause they're angry
with you.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.729
They said that?

19:47.729 --> 19:49.522
Yeah, they're upset
that we're not married yet.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.983
And they think that you're
not trying hard enough.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.693
But I am. I am trying. I--

19:53.693 --> 19:55.070
They've started to talk
about what to do

19:55.070 --> 19:56.654
because you've lost faith.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.323
And they may not wait
till you're 16.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.574
They may take Susan
and make her

19:59.574 --> 20:01.201
take your place right now.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.578
They said that?

20:03.578 --> 20:06.956
And the scary thing is,
she's so small.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.921
She's so small having a baby
could kill her.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.388
Because they've been clear
from the start,

20:21.388 --> 20:24.391
if it falls to Susan,

20:24.391 --> 20:27.185
you'll only have yourself
to blame.

20:31.773 --> 20:37.070
Now, that is why
we have to get married.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.322
All right?

20:39.322 --> 20:40.865
When this trip is over,
I'm going to get

20:40.865 --> 20:42.784
those last ducks in a row
to make sure that happens.

20:42.784 --> 20:46.037
But you're with me on this,
right, completely?

20:46.037 --> 20:48.915
No distractions, no slacking.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.417
Total focus.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.629
Say it.

20:58.383 --> 21:01.469
I'm with you...

21:01.469 --> 21:03.388
completely.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.307
I hope so.

21:15.358 --> 21:18.903
And please, Heavenly Father,

21:18.903 --> 21:20.572
guide Mary Ann.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.866
Might she know what to say

21:22.866 --> 21:26.286
so that you'll tell us
where Jan is.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.250
Please protect her.

21:51.478 --> 21:55.357
Please bring Jan back

21:55.357 --> 21:57.859
so that we can be
together again.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.698
Heavenly Father,
I promise to return

22:03.698 --> 22:06.409
to the path of righteousness.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.496
God, please.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.875
Give me another chance
to be her mom again.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.006
Amen.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.758
- Amen.
- Amen.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.596
All right.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.306

your plate, honey?

Can I get you anything?

23:54.017 --> 23:55.560
No, thank you.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.480
Mmm.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.565
I'm here by myself.

Mm-hmm.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.319
Where's Jan?

24:04.319 --> 24:07.238
You know...

24:07.238 --> 24:08.615
I think Jan is going through

24:08.615 --> 24:10.283
a very difficult time
right now.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.249
I'm dating a new woman.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.793
I'm not sure you heard that.

24:21.336 --> 24:23.254
Is that who I saw you with?

24:24.839 --> 24:26.966
Yeah, she's got a daughter.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.220
Carly, good kid.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.305
Good kid, very artistic.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.431
That's sweet.

24:33.431 --> 24:35.266
Yeah.

24:35.266 --> 24:38.728
Well, I think Jan
must be jealous or something,

24:38.728 --> 24:41.523
because the strangest thing
happened yesterday.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.275
What happened?

24:44.275 --> 24:48.988
Well, Carly left the house
to go to school.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.450
And these four hippies,
hippies with long hair

24:52.450 --> 24:56.121
in an out-of-state car
start riding alongside her.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.040
One of them shouts
out the window, says,

24:59.040 --> 25:00.625
"Are you Carly?"

25:00.625 --> 25:04.504
This poor girl is so scared
she doesn't know what to say.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.673
And he says, "If you're Carly,

25:06.673 --> 25:09.259
"I've got a message for you
from Jan.

25:09.259 --> 25:10.844
"You stay away from Bob.

25:10.844 --> 25:13.096
He belongs to Jan Broberg."

25:14.431 --> 25:16.057
- Good heavens.
- Yep.

25:17.225 --> 25:19.602
My girlfriend, Carly's mother,
she's, you know,

25:19.602 --> 25:21.229
she's real upset.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.189
She says,
'All the trouble you're in,

25:23.189 --> 25:25.859
now you go and get involved
in something like this?"

25:25.859 --> 25:28.862
I said, "I didn't have
nothing to do with it."

25:28.862 --> 25:32.574
Jan has got her heart set
on us getting married.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.035
And she just will not
stand the thought

25:35.035 --> 25:36.703
of anyone getting
in the way of it.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.543
Are you sure I can't
get you something?

25:43.543 --> 25:45.086
Where is she?

25:49.924 --> 25:51.593
Let's take a walk.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.979
Where to?

26:02.979 --> 26:05.607
Well, I'm parked
right out front.

27:00.745 --> 27:02.789
You think I came here
to sign a piece of paper

27:02.789 --> 27:04.916
so you can marry my daughter?

27:06.918 --> 27:09.587
You just sign
on the dotted line.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.381
OK?

27:11.381 --> 27:13.550
We're all tired of doing this.

27:13.550 --> 27:16.428
You sign and you
bring her home.

27:16.428 --> 27:18.054
OK, you don't even have
to tell Bob about it.

27:18.054 --> 27:20.640
I spoke to a new lawyer
who said we can get this done

27:20.640 --> 27:22.183
with only one signature.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.737
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

27:33.737 --> 27:35.280
No.

and act like it's evidence.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.826
You just sign, OK?

27:39.826 --> 27:42.537
You sign and you end this.

27:42.537 --> 27:44.289
Over my dead body.

27:44.289 --> 27:45.707
Well, let's not make it
come to that, Mary Ann.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.719
Tell me where she is.

28:00.138 --> 28:01.681
Fine.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.309
You don't want to sign it?

28:04.309 --> 28:06.353
I'm done talking.
- You're not done talking.

28:06.353 --> 28:09.439
You're gonna tell me
where she is right now.

28:18.323 --> 28:19.366
I don't think you understand
what I mean

28:19.366 --> 28:22.243
when I say I'm done talking,
Mary Ann.

28:23.828 --> 28:26.915
What I mean is...

28:26.915 --> 28:29.209
I don't have much use
for you anymore.

28:30.919 --> 28:33.129
You won't hurt me.

28:35.674 --> 28:37.342
It'll mean you can't have Jan.

28:38.843 --> 28:40.553

I need you alive.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.138

threaten me, Mary Ann.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.517

28:47.477 --> 28:49.270

28:49.270 --> 28:51.231
Get out of this car and you
don't come crawling back to me

28:51.231 --> 28:52.774
until you can put
your own ego aside

28:52.774 --> 28:54.776
and you do what's
right for Jan.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.114

Was it when you were out
with your father last week?

30:19.444 --> 30:23.365
I was with my father,
Mr. Tobler.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.535
But I didn't fall down.

with a really important man
in the government, and...

30:41.800 --> 30:44.886

32:03.798 --> 32:05.383
I'm sorry.

32:07.302 --> 32:08.762
Yeah, well, don't
talk about things

32:08.762 --> 32:10.472
that you don't know about.

32:14.809 --> 32:17.228
I was just worried about you.

32:18.688 --> 32:20.398
Well, I'm fine.

32:21.775 --> 32:24.402
Is your dad hard on you?

32:25.737 --> 32:27.655
Is that what it is?

32:28.656 --> 32:32.494
Mr. Tobler is the only person
who truly cares about me.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.998
He's the only one who's helping
me do what I need to do.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.670
You call your dad Mr. Tobler?

32:44.964 --> 32:47.133
No, Janice, wait.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.052
Something's going on and--

32:49.052 --> 32:51.805
I don't want
to be friends, OK?

32:54.891 --> 32:58.311
Just please stay away from me.

32:59.938 --> 33:02.232
Everyone around me gets hurt.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.708
Hello? Brobergs.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.585
<i>Mary Ann?</i>

33:24.504 --> 33:26.381
Jan, honey, is that you?

33:27.674 --> 33:29.175
Jan, where are you?

33:32.887 --> 33:35.390
I tried to call earlier,
but the line was busy.

33:35.390 --> 33:36.891
Tell her we miss her.

33:36.891 --> 33:38.518
We miss you.

33:38.518 --> 33:40.395
It's so good
to hear your voice.

33:40.395 --> 33:41.771
<i>Ask her where she is.</i>

33:41.771 --> 33:43.148
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>

33:43.148 --> 33:45.066
<i>I wasn't all there
for you when you needed me.</i>

33:45.066 --> 33:46.901
<i>Are you OK?
- Ask her where she is.</i>

33:46.901 --> 33:48.737
<i>How are you, honey?</i>

33:48.737 --> 33:50.196
<i>Where are you?</i>

33:50.196 --> 33:53.241
Did you sign
the marriage papers yet?

33:53.241 --> 33:56.369
<i>Look, I know you
don't like this,</i>

33:56.369 --> 33:57.954
<i>but B says that
I can't see you</i>

33:57.954 --> 33:59.247
<i>until you sign them.</i>

34:01.708 --> 34:03.376
No, I haven't signed
the papers

34:03.376 --> 34:05.545
because I'm not going
to sign the papers

34:05.545 --> 34:08.006
because your father and I
don't want you

34:08.006 --> 34:09.758
to marry that man.

34:09.758 --> 34:11.676
<i>OK. Bye, then.</i>

34:11.676 --> 34:14.429
No, wait, wait,
talk to your sisters.

34:14.429 --> 34:15.930
Come on.

34:15.930 --> 34:17.807
Hi, Jan.

34:17.807 --> 34:19.351
<i>Hey, Karen.</i>

34:20.769 --> 34:22.103
Listen.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.439
Has anything weird
been going on?

34:24.439 --> 34:26.900
Have you seen any UFOs?

34:26.900 --> 34:29.152
UFOs?

34:29.152 --> 34:31.404
No, we haven't seen any.

34:31.404 --> 34:33.031
<i>Why are you asking about this?</i>

34:33.031 --> 34:34.491
No reason.

34:35.700 --> 34:37.619
Is Susan there?

34:37.619 --> 34:38.953
Is she OK?

34:38.953 --> 34:40.205
<i>She's fine.</i>

34:40.205 --> 34:41.623
<i>She's right here.</i>

34:41.623 --> 34:45.043
<i>Do you wanna talk to her?</i>
- Yeah. Now, please.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.757
Hi, Jan.

34:50.757 --> 34:52.967
- Hey, Susan.
<i>- We miss you.</i>

34:52.967 --> 34:54.386
How are you?

34:54.386 --> 34:56.429
<i>I'm doing really good.</i>

34:56.429 --> 34:58.264
<i>I just miss your voice.
That's all.</i>

34:58.264 --> 34:59.474
<i>Wait, hold on.</i>

34:59.474 --> 35:02.102
<i>I need to put in more coins.</i>

35:18.451 --> 35:20.412
<i>I need to put in more coins.</i>

35:33.216 --> 35:34.801
It's nine quarters
and a dime.

35:37.637 --> 35:41.141
There are only six areas
in the United States

35:41.141 --> 35:44.978
that are $2.35
from Pocatello, Idaho,

35:44.978 --> 35:47.147
five small municipalities

35:47.147 --> 35:49.482
and Los Angeles.

35:49.482 --> 35:52.277
How many schools
do you think are in L.A.?

35:52.277 --> 35:54.362
That's your job.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.624
Her name is Jan Broberg.

36:06.624 --> 36:10.378
And why exactly are you
looking for this girl?

36:10.378 --> 36:12.630
We're checking all
the schools in the area.

36:13.882 --> 36:15.216
She here?

36:19.304 --> 36:21.181
No.

36:21.181 --> 36:23.767
I'm sorry. I haven't seen her.

36:23.767 --> 36:24.768
Good luck.

36:24.768 --> 36:26.853
- Thank you, Sister.
- Thank you.

36:26.853 --> 36:28.980
Right this way.

36:49.709 --> 36:50.919
Hello?

36:50.919 --> 36:52.712
<i>Hello, Mr. Tobler?</i>

36:52.712 --> 36:55.215
<i>It's Sister Ramona
with Flintridge Academy.</i>

36:55.215 --> 36:58.218
<i>I know you said to only call
this number in an emergency,</i>

36:58.218 --> 37:00.804
<i>but I just wanted to tell you
that I have never lied</i>

37:00.804 --> 37:03.223
<i>to a police officer
in my life.</i>

37:03.223 --> 37:05.392
<i>They came here saying that
they were looking for Janice,</i>

37:05.392 --> 37:07.352
<i>but they had a different name.</i>

37:07.352 --> 37:08.812
<i>It all seemed very strange.</i>

37:08.812 --> 37:11.398
<i>So I told them that
she wasn't here.</i>

37:11.398 --> 37:13.566
<i>But if those
were real officers,</i>

37:13.566 --> 37:15.318
<i>then I don't want
to mislead them.</i>

37:15.318 --> 37:17.153
I'm sorry,
it's the wrong number.

37:47.142 --> 37:48.601
Watch it, man!

37:48.601 --> 37:50.812
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

38:11.541 --> 38:13.543
Hi, Sister Ramona,
it's Frank Tobler.

38:13.543 --> 38:15.754
Sorry, I had to tell you
that was a wrong number.

38:15.754 --> 38:17.422
I'm concerned there
was a compromised line.

38:17.422 --> 38:21.259
But I'm calling you back
now from a secure line.

38:21.259 --> 38:24.929
So, you know,
you did the right thing.

38:24.929 --> 38:26.348
You did the right thing
not believing

38:26.348 --> 38:27.599
those police impersonators.

38:27.599 --> 38:29.100
And, you know,
the U.S. government

38:29.100 --> 38:30.769
thanks you for your service.

38:30.769 --> 38:35.523
But you just--
you hang tight, OK?

38:35.523 --> 38:37.567
And you tell Jan--
you tell Janice

38:37.567 --> 38:40.028
I might have to, uh,
come take her

38:40.028 --> 38:42.530
out of school
for just a little bit.

38:42.530 --> 38:45.909
But you don't worry,
because we will prevail.

38:47.827 --> 38:49.037
OK, bye now.

39:14.938 --> 39:16.564
Go with him.

39:19.609 --> 39:20.902
Hi, buddy, no, no, no.

39:20.902 --> 39:21.945
I need this phone.

39:21.945 --> 39:23.113
Sorry.

39:26.866 --> 39:27.951
Hello, operator.

39:27.951 --> 39:29.536
This is agent
Peter Welsh with the FBI.

39:29.536 --> 39:30.870
I have a subpoena to search,

39:30.870 --> 39:32.372
and I can stay on the phone
with you for as long

39:32.372 --> 39:33.957
as it takes till
I verify my identity.

39:33.957 --> 39:36.084
Now, what I need
is the location

39:36.084 --> 39:37.794
and the number
of the call that was

39:37.794 --> 39:40.422
just placed
from this pay phone.

39:55.603 --> 39:57.897
Excuse me, can I help you?

39:57.897 --> 40:00.108
We're looking
for Jan Broberg.

40:00.108 --> 40:02.027
I told your
colleagues there's no one

40:02.027 --> 40:03.945
here by that name.

40:03.945 --> 40:06.531
I'd like to see
some identification, please.

41:10.136 --> 41:12.305

42:03.565 --> 42:04.983
- Jan Broberg...

42:04.983 --> 42:07.318
We're taking you
into custody as a runaway.
