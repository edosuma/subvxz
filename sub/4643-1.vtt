Hello guys, it's Friday, October 30.

00:39.530 --> 00:41.310
And the next thing we are going to talk about
's 'Grave Encounters'.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.267
Grave Encounters.
- Grave Encounters.

00:43.490 --> 00:45.445
Grave Encounters.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.946
It is a record found 'movie.

00:48.947 --> 00:51.747
As Paranormal Activity, REC
or The Blair Witch Project.

00:52.341 --> 00:56.279
They follow a bunch of ghost hunters, who
new reality TV show filming.

00:56.502 --> 00:59.913
That leads to an abandoned psychiatric hospital
in search of the unknown...

01:00.170 --> 01:02.760
Ended much more realistic than they
expected.

01:02.983 --> 01:06.097
They met 'Grave Encounters'
- These effects are well done...

01:06.258 --> 01:09.330
The camera work is terrible.
- The only thing wrong with the film...

01:09.553 --> 01:13.165
it's a good movie, but not scary.

01:13.388 --> 01:17.212
He's fucking scary.
- He's terribly creepy.

01:17.469 --> 01:20.424
You're looking at him and
it plays with your mind.

01:20.681 --> 01:25.347
And there are quite scary in parts.
Faces of people who do so.

01:25.604 --> 01:27.343
You can not tell if this is real.

01:27.566 --> 01:29.971
This is scary,
it's really scary.

01:30.228 --> 01:33.979
This movie makes me so scared
I'm not here to lie...

01:34.036 --> 01:36.992
so much that I almost wet my pants did.

01:37.049 --> 01:38.909
And the end
I must talk about the end...

01:38.966 --> 01:44.735
end because this was one of the worst
end pieces of my life.

01:44.958 --> 01:49.611
I think I have this movie
'Grave Encounters', lets skip.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.829
a scale of four.

01:52.086 --> 01:53.622
I think this was all for this week.

01:53.879 --> 01:57.499
This Movie Madness by Alex.

Thanks for watching and
a happy Halloween.

02:07.642 --> 02:11.037
Grave Encounters Part 2.

02:13.646 --> 02:15.405
Where are you going?
- Where you're not going.

02:15.406 --> 02:18.639
Lucky.
- Hey, remember me?

02:19.796 --> 02:21.716
Stay with me, motherfucker.

02:26.955 --> 02:32.672
My god, that's another kiss, Tessa.
- Trevor, lazer on.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.507
Are there not some freshmen there?
- I hope so.

02:35.564 --> 02:39.970
I know you do not like to eat a dick.
Come on, make an exception for me.

02:47.180 --> 02:49.332
Are you okay?

02:49.588 --> 02:52.811
Are you Michael from thriller.
Or are you dead Michael.

02:52.868 --> 02:57.438
I'm dead Michael, sweetie.
Where are the kids then?

03:01.115 --> 03:03.323
Are you here filming
with this piece of shit?

03:04.780 --> 03:08.248
My camera may be small but are
I have a huge throbbing penis.

03:08.249 --> 03:11.049
Not like that little of you.

03:17.753 --> 03:21.673
What have we here?
My God.

03:21.796 --> 03:25.270
Jennifer.
- Where's Alex?

03:25.327 --> 03:28.313
I do not know.
- Is he here? Did he come with you?

03:28.470 --> 03:32.569
He's not with me.
- I was really hoping I would see him tonight.

03:32.826 --> 03:35.328
Want tongues? Okay.

03:35.585 --> 03:39.350
I love the balance you.
You should now continue drinking.

03:40.112 --> 03:42.677
Knock on the doors.

03:49.176 --> 03:51.064
Do you really annoy me now?

03:54.398 --> 03:56.452
Learn  once to knock.
- Hey, man.

03:56.912 --> 03:57.742
Put the fucking camera down.

03:57.841 --> 04:00.941
There is a mega party here and
you're masturbating.

04:01.031 --> 04:04.259
Take you kidding me?
Await real vaginas on you there.

04:04.316 --> 04:06.636
And Jen wants your body friend.

04:07.693 --> 04:11.432
Is Jennifer there?
- Like I said, she looks good.

04:11.689 --> 04:15.391
Not as good as this, but...
very good.

04:15.614 --> 04:17.192
I have no costume, I can not go.
- Error.

04:17.449 --> 04:21.148
You have a costume.
I have one won?

04:21.404 --> 04:24.199
No, I do not.
I'm not wearing this fucking.

04:24.456 --> 04:26.277
Yes, you are, it's Halloween.
- I'm not wearing.

04:26.695 --> 04:28.671
No, absolutely not.

04:31.878 --> 04:35.325
I can not believe I've persuaded me
.

04:35.581 --> 04:38.494
Your ass is amazing.
- Look yet.

04:38.751 --> 04:42.146
Cut it out. I'm not so among men.

04:44.381 --> 04:47.042
friend Jack.
Do you listen.

04:47.799 --> 04:50.636
There is no class in the horror movies.

04:50.893 --> 04:55.131
No class, I tell you,
it comes to fast shooting and large lenses.

04:55.354 --> 04:57.927
CGI needs to models to use.

04:58.184 --> 05:02.118
And makeup effects.
- I think you're right.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.814
As earlier.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.058
I agree with you.
- Carpenter, Craven...

05:06.315 --> 05:08.300
where are these guys in our generation?

05:08.623 --> 05:12.671
Where are you?
This school death the new Gravens.

05:12.861 --> 05:14.927
Nobody.
I'll tell you where they are.

05:15.185 --> 05:16.985
They're here, friend.
Speech.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.710
My name is Alex Wright.
You two are fucking...

05:19.967 --> 05:22.367
genius, baby.

05:22.624 --> 05:24.914
Alex's film revolves
ladies and gentlemen.

05:24.971 --> 05:27.165
I will make a horror movie.

05:27.922 --> 05:31.043
I will rediscover the genre.
- Yeah, I guess.

05:31.100 --> 05:34.205
You know it and I know it.
It will be artistic.

05:34.655 --> 05:38.877
a vision.
I will be a visionary, damn.

05:38.978 --> 05:40.875
And I must say that kind of trouble.

05:41.333 --> 05:44.285
Party on, fuckers.

05:52.395 --> 05:57.535
That is delicious.
Sleeping Beauty.

06:04.492 --> 06:06.515
Wake up, bitch.

06:09.622 --> 06:13.116
How do you feel big boy?

06:13.373 --> 06:16.327
Look, who's your friend?

06:16.584 --> 06:19.109
my timeline but I would just check
if I were you.

06:20.866 --> 06:22.609
Why?

06:23.466 --> 06:26.353
There are some funny photos of you on.
From last night.

06:27.876 --> 06:31.583
What have you done?
Tell me what you did.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.007
Keep watching and you'll see.

06:34.264 --> 06:37.178
You grab me at my breasts.

06:37.435 --> 06:40.008
That was the problem,
why did you let me drink a whole bottle of tequila.

06:40.265 --> 06:41.883
You grabbed it and wanted
not return.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.424
Who is this man?

06:43.581 --> 06:47.096
I have no idea.
Look.

06:48.653 --> 06:50.399
Look, that's you.

06:50.656 --> 06:53.395
Why hell.
Why did you put that shit on there?

06:53.651 --> 06:56.650
Take it away.
- No, I did not even getagt.

06:56.907 --> 06:58.776
are my balls.
- I do not care.

06:59.033 --> 07:04.425
fucking a YouTube sensation.
It has 26 hits, my balls go virtual.

07:04.482 --> 07:07.493
Take your fucking kidding me?
- Beautiful photo.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.698
no fool who tries to help me?

07:10.954 --> 07:13.832
You stood in full attention man.

07:14.089 --> 07:16.689
You're almost a star.
- I'm my tag removal.

07:16.946 --> 07:18.186
I get my tag away.
Fuck.

07:18.209 --> 07:22.440
Hello, do you know where I can find weed?
Or marijuana?

07:23.297 --> 07:26.777
Hey friend, I'm looking for weed.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.595
Okay. Dr. Sam.

07:34.856 --> 07:37.182
Good times at the film academy.

07:37.985 --> 07:40.683
Right.
- What are you doing?

07:40.940 --> 07:45.941
I check the news and opinions.
- You are such a nerd.

07:46.197 --> 07:48.936
I do not care.
My opinion is given a name out there.

07:49.193 --> 07:52.276
Watch this only once.
I have a video response.

07:56.347 --> 07:59.787
guy who
"Grave Encounters" distributed.

08:15.678 --> 08:18.549
I do not remember that scene in the movie
Sat

08:19.506 --> 08:22.771
Who sent that video?

08:23.028 --> 08:26.223
"Death Awaits"

08:26.480 --> 08:28.016
The message is "Death Awaits"

08:28.273 --> 08:31.419
Find out where the video comes from.
And the problem is resolved.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.738
Can we please have some
tacos for dinner?

08:49.354 --> 08:52.450
Gary, stop.
That's enough.

08:52.707 --> 08:55.799
provoke not Stacey.
You find it fine.

08:58.456 --> 09:01.284
Gary.
Stop.

09:03.841 --> 09:05.554
Dirty bitch.

09:06.711 --> 09:10.500
Look. I know that tonight
exactly a year ago...

09:10.757 --> 09:14.231
that your father disappeared, but
you must agree to live now.

09:25.150 --> 09:27.156
That provocative bitch.

09:36.382 --> 09:38.990
Hello? Who's there?

09:41.147 --> 09:44.477
Who does this, it's not funny.

09:47.508 --> 09:51.735
Gary.
Where are you?

09:54.051 --> 09:56.114
No. My god no.

10:05.168 --> 10:06.678
I'm sorry.

10:07.534 --> 10:13.465
Okay, let's just go,
I'm cold.

10:13.688 --> 10:15.437
Gary?

10:20.971 --> 10:22.538
No.

10:24.195 --> 10:26.898
And cut.
That was for Marty.

10:28.823 --> 10:32.697
We go straight through to the other shots, okay?
- That sounds good.

10:32.819 --> 10:35.253
Jennifer  My God, you're officially
becoming the next...

10:35.354 --> 10:36.865
queen of scream to be.
- Really?

10:36.915 --> 10:38.625
Alex?
- Yes?

10:38.626 --> 10:41.362
How could a man after his death
back on there?

10:41.619 --> 10:43.201
That makes no sense.

10:43.324 --> 10:46.202
This is a great start.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.060
I am a professional.
- Breasts.

10:48.117 --> 10:50.243
Trev. "Death Awaits" replied.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.131
Yes, and what does he say?
- Look.

10:55.929 --> 10:58.950
What is that?
Is it a phone?

10:59.444 --> 11:01.427
49.14.122.48.

11:01.684 --> 11:03.964
are too many numbers to
a phone to be.

11:04.221 --> 11:08.379
Who is it? Who has sent you this?
- Alex has a stalker on YouTube.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.863
It makes no sense.

11:11.086 --> 11:12.943
I checked the website and
again with Google Maps.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.362
logical, but I do not understand why he sent me to this
.

11:15.619 --> 11:17.832
Wait, go back to the part where
you're talking about...

11:18.089 --> 11:20.267
the length of the songs and stuff.

11:20.524 --> 11:26.252
Okay, 49.14.122.48.
The message of "Death Awaits".

11:26.510 --> 11:28.608
The numbers are latitude, longitude.
I think.

11:28.643 --> 11:32.609
Where do you think they mean?
- Vancouver Canada, the exact location...

11:32.915 --> 11:35.369
a psychiatric institution called...

11:35.626 --> 11:38.074
I think they see the movie Grave Encounters
have recorded.

11:38.331 --> 11:42.020
They call the building
Collen Wood in the film.

11:42.077 --> 11:45.796
'Collen Wood' does not exist, but
... it.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.639
And that's the same bullshit
what we already had.

11:47.762 --> 11:50.251
It was built at the end of the century,
mad doctors, lobotomy.

11:50.507 --> 11:52.588
All that crap...
That's all real, it happened.

11:58.789 --> 12:00.389
There it is.

12:05.039 --> 12:06.874
Where the hell are you?

12:07.350 --> 12:09.695
Male, Trevor check this out ..

12:12.072 --> 12:14.295
Have you seen this? It scares me.
- Look you here for?

12:15.351 --> 12:17.641
Many people believe that this is real
I'm not the only one.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.384
They thought Blair Witch Project really was.

12:23.441 --> 12:26.988
Yes, and Paranormal Activity and
stupid thing in space, on the moon.

12:27.245 --> 12:28.830
It's just a marketing ploy, Alex.

12:29.087 --> 12:31.142
That's exactly what they want you to think.
It's just a movie.

12:31.999 --> 12:34.517
And, I mean it's not even a good movie.
I mean...

12:34.574 --> 12:36.093
look at the special effects.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.622
No single actor in this movie has
something done, since the film was released.

12:39.679 --> 12:43.791
Nothing. Can you explain that?
The caretaker's been dead eight years now.

12:44.048 --> 12:47.909
Kenny Sandoval, committed suicide in 2004...

12:48.166 --> 12:50.613
shot himself with a shotgun.
The guy went crazy.

12:50.736 --> 12:52.678
What about your own film, Alex?

12:52.701 --> 12:57.154
do you a favor policeman who
for details to quickly settle?

12:58.700 --> 13:01.201
Hello everyone. Actually, I have some questions...

13:01.458 --> 13:03.690
where I need help,
to find answers...

13:03.947 --> 13:06.000
about a movie I saw last week,
Grave Encounters.

13:06.557 --> 13:08.200
I try to get in touch with the directors
...

13:08.257 --> 13:10.235
or one of the actors or someone
that has to do...

13:10.492 --> 13:13.065
with the film.
But I can not find any information about them.

13:13.322 --> 13:16.026
There's something about that movie that is not true
and I want to the bottom.

13:16.249 --> 13:20.369
So, if you or someone you know knows how
may come into contact with them.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.932
Please, leave a message.
I would really appreciate it.

13:49.148 --> 13:53.347
Help.
Help. Somebody help me.

13:56.947 --> 14:00.839
Please, why are you doing this to me?
Let me go.

14:00.996 --> 14:05.095
No, help!

14:10.123 --> 14:13.030
It's time for your appointment.
- No.

14:16.672 --> 14:21.936
You fucking psycho.
- It seems that you have holes.

14:34.268 --> 14:36.464
What is that?

14:38.063 --> 14:42.865
No, please no.
- This may hurt a little.

14:43.122 --> 14:46.455
No, no.

14:48.218 --> 14:53.024
Stop.
- What did you think?

14:53.281 --> 14:56.166
Did you like it?
- It was good.

14:56.947 --> 15:01.003
I just need some things to think about.
- You do not seem very happy with it.

15:02.716 --> 15:04.840
Is it my performance?
- No, it was not your bet.

15:05.076 --> 15:07.690
I have several variants
of practice, so we can...

15:07.691 --> 15:11.251
It's not your fault. Okay.
- What about your dick man?

15:11.307 --> 15:12.851
The pictures look great.

15:12.882 --> 15:15.251
It looks good I admit.
But it's so cliché.

15:15.508 --> 15:18.787
A masked man and a tied girl.
We have so often seen.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.623
This is fucking torture porn, man.
Where people love.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.209
You can earn $ 100 million.
- Yes, but I do not care.

15:24.832 --> 15:27.019
I do not know. I must again
quiet about it.

15:27.142 --> 15:28.704
Everyone can go, I have to rewrite it.

15:30.311 --> 15:32.550
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.574
Really?
- Great.

15:38.393 --> 15:42.767
Jen, it was really good.
It scared me.

15:43.024 --> 15:44.532
Thank you.

15:44.760 --> 15:48.294
So look more cheerful.
- Film me that.

15:49.667 --> 15:52.033
Okay, so I just picked up my mail and...

15:52.290 --> 15:56.677
And I have a message from the YouTube user who
lately sending messages.

15:56.734 --> 15:58.653
Let's see what he has sent.

15:59.010 --> 16:01.957
This is a picture of Sean Rogerson
when he was younger.

16:02.214 --> 16:04.824
The woman next to him should be his mother.

16:05.081 --> 16:08.116
It came from a phone,
it is a local number from Washington...

16:08.173 --> 16:10.704
so I will try.
Maybe it's about his mother.

16:10.927 --> 16:12.504
Let's see where it goes.

16:12.661 --> 16:15.875
Hello?
- Hello, this is the house of Rogerson?

16:16.132 --> 16:19.419
Yes.
- I'm looking for Sean, is he?

16:19.676 --> 16:23.067
Why do you want to talk to Sean?
- I'm doing a thesis on...

16:23.290 --> 16:27.917
a movie where he participated named
Grave Encounters. I'd like to interview.

16:28.043 --> 16:33.271
It would really help if I'm not the only one who would have had to navigate
.

16:33.527 --> 16:35.991
You do not have to.
The GPS helps you.

16:36.092 --> 16:39.692
Yes, many good friends do that...
- This is the white terminator error.

16:41.742 --> 16:45.608
They do not help us. Computers are
not help us. It's in their nature.

16:45.765 --> 16:48.843
must.
- We seem to be there.

16:49.499 --> 16:54.078
Okay, so what was that girl again?
- Elijah, Trevor I say now for the 18th time.

16:54.335 --> 16:56.973
And they said Sean certainly would be?

16:57.029 --> 16:59.700
Sean would be here at three o'clock and willing
to do an interview.

16:59.957 --> 17:02.678
Let's do it.
- Easily said, let's go.

17:03.701 --> 17:06.685
Wait,
I do it with a big lens filming.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.256
I do not understand why you've brought your camera
.

17:09.512 --> 17:11.440
That's for my documentary
for the 15th time...

17:11.696 --> 17:13.551
Your documentary adds nothing to it.

17:13.809 --> 17:15.396
Your documentary adds nothing to it.

17:15.519 --> 17:17.098
This is exactly where my documentary about.
- Shut up.

17:19.564 --> 17:21.259
Hello.
- Alex?

17:21.415 --> 17:25.020
Yes, Alex and this is my friend Trevor.

17:25.277 --> 17:28.932
Nice to meet you,
come inside before you catch cold.

17:29.189 --> 17:30.972
Yes, thank you.
- Absolutely.

17:31.195 --> 17:33.393
Guys, wait up.

17:35.452 --> 17:40.691
Would you like some tea or coffee?
I have a nice tea in the pot.

17:40.948 --> 17:42.836
I do nothing, thank you.

17:43.093 --> 17:45.604
I do also nothing, not all of us, I think.
But thanks anyway.

17:47.151 --> 17:49.616
What does the picture look like?
- Prima.

17:49.873 --> 17:52.583
Mrs. Rogerson, Sean is now in the neighborhood?

17:52.840 --> 17:56.401
He just left, you just missed him.
But he comes back soon.

17:56.658 --> 18:00.151
Okay, but Sean lives?
He's okay?

18:00.408 --> 18:04.753
course, I always tease him,
that he is a workaholic.

18:05.010 --> 18:07.804
He is currently working
a new TV series.

18:08.061 --> 18:11.674
He loves acting, he always wanted
actor, even when he was little.

18:11.930 --> 18:13.598
we wait for him
if you wish.

18:13.855 --> 18:17.838
He will be glad to see you,
he loves it when people come to visit.

18:18.095 --> 18:23.640
Sean, lives here?
- His whole life al Yes.

18:23.863 --> 18:27.276
Yes, of course, why wait
you not in his room?

18:27.533 --> 18:29.922
That's what he liked.
It's up the stairs, and then right.

18:40.543 --> 18:44.365
Best Player 1996.

18:44.622 --> 18:46.582
Look at this.

18:46.839 --> 18:49.994
I think here a long time
nobody lives.

18:50.217 --> 18:52.247
That's him when he was younger.

18:52.504 --> 18:55.125
He looks like the "Real Slim Shady".

18:55.382 --> 18:56.977
That's a really bad haircut.

18:57.235 --> 18:58.795
He loved cats.

18:59.018 --> 19:01.180
you?
- Yes, I...

19:01.437 --> 19:04.597
What are you doing here?

19:04.853 --> 19:08.885
Sorry, but who are you?
- I'm the nurse Mrs. Rogerson.

19:09.142 --> 19:11.632
Mrs. Rogerson said we could wait
here.

19:11.633 --> 19:14.749
We have an interview with Sean.
- You must go now.

19:14.972 --> 19:17.516
We were...
- You must go.

19:17.517 --> 19:18.917
You have to leave.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.186
She said...
- Get out.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.627
Get out, now.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.108
We try to steal anything.
- This is ridiculous.

19:24.614 --> 19:26.317
She said we could wait.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.354
We would just like to speak with Sean.

19:28.611 --> 19:33.261
Sean coming soon.
Soon as he is allowed to leave the hospital.

19:33.318 --> 19:35.163
Which hospital do you mean?
What are you talking about?

19:35.186 --> 19:36.989
hospital for crazy people.

19:37.212 --> 19:40.243
You know 'Grave Encounters'?
The TV series?

19:41.800 --> 19:45.655
I helped you to find his name, Lance Preston.

19:45.912 --> 19:49.731
That was his stage name.
- Do not touch camera on.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.386
Out.
- Okay, we're al

19:52.643 --> 19:54.571
more thing.
What happened to Sean?

19:54.572 --> 19:55.632
What happened to
the rest of his team?

19:55.855 --> 19:58.798
She invited us here.
We are her guests.

19:59.055 --> 20:01.134
We just want an interview with Sean.
That's all.

20:01.391 --> 20:02.800
It is not intended that
they answer the phone.

20:03.023 --> 20:07.460
She suffers from dementia, and gets
from January full nursing.

20:12.616 --> 20:14.652
Did you hear that?

20:14.909 --> 20:17.239
She knew 'Grave Encounters'

20:17.496 --> 20:21.877
Look, she's nuts.
- Indeed.

20:22.934 --> 20:26.739
hell.
She waves still.

20:27.501 --> 20:29.288
Man, she makes him.
This should really see.

20:29.545 --> 20:32.068
Yeah, man. She was angry after the play.

20:33.741 --> 20:37.664
Alex, the point is, you said you would
would be there, but you were not there.

20:37.921 --> 20:40.873
conditions showed the
... I know it sounds bad, but...

20:41.096 --> 20:43.523
It was also important for me.

20:43.780 --> 20:46.171
I know, I'm sorry.
- You promised you'd be there.

20:46.428 --> 20:48.472
And you were not.

20:48.729 --> 20:50.806
I searched everywhere for you.
- I know.

20:51.061 --> 20:53.258
I'm sorry, but look at this.

20:53.515 --> 20:55.194
You're obsessed.
It's a movie.

20:55.451 --> 20:57.351
It's not just one damn movie.
Listen to me.

20:57.352 --> 21:01.809
Call the mayor of Vancouver.
They have a file on March 28.

21:02.066 --> 21:04.432
I do not care.
- 2003.

21:04.489 --> 21:06.984
I do not care.
- Okay, then.

21:07.241 --> 21:11.323
know, I'm so damn movie Sat
Do what you want.

21:11.580 --> 21:13.493
You do not worry about me
more to do.

21:13.750 --> 21:14.864
Day Jenn.
- Fuck you, Trevor.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.085
Not now.

21:23.002 --> 21:24.816
What was her problem?

21:26.673 --> 21:28.745
I feel bad about the play...

21:29.002 --> 21:31.039
but what can I say?
This is important.

21:33.638 --> 21:35.584
What?
You're not with me?

21:37.659 --> 21:41.297
I mean, I'm telling you,
from friend to friend, okay.

21:43.020 --> 21:45.309
Jenn is probably the only
girl on this campus...

21:45.344 --> 21:47.598
with the greatest chance
that you do your penis can stabbing.

21:47.732 --> 21:51.181
Yes, that's true.

21:52.471 --> 21:55.141
And now this has been said.
If I were you...

21:55.397 --> 21:58.101
I would drop the conspiracy theory.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.810
Conspiracy Theory?

22:00.033 --> 22:03.106
Dude, I love you, but...
- Look at the evidence.

22:03.363 --> 22:06.365
Missing, missing team.
Possible death.

22:06.622 --> 22:08.529
What do I need to prove?

22:08.786 --> 22:10.027
See what I mean?

22:10.250 --> 22:12.536
every day I wake up next to "Rainman".

22:12.793 --> 22:15.956
Fuck, Rainman was a genius.

22:19.465 --> 22:22.287
Hello everyone, I know it's been a while
ago, I've posted some...

22:22.510 --> 22:27.999
but there are many strange things happened,
during our research and recordings.

22:28.256 --> 22:31.002
I did an interview with the mother
Sean Rogerson.

22:31.259 --> 22:34.512
Listen to me, 'Grave Encounters' is real.

22:34.769 --> 22:37.070
My friends do not believe me.
And I myself probably not.

22:37.327 --> 22:39.594
But I'm not crazy.
I've done my research.

22:39.851 --> 22:43.187
I just need proof.

22:43.443 --> 22:46.029
Maybe we should go back to Takoma,
and read some more articles.

22:46.286 --> 22:48.343
more...

23:00.663 --> 23:03.531
The printer is automatically entered
and starts printing...

23:03.774 --> 23:06.650
without anything I've done.

23:09.834 --> 23:13.799
2384 Melrose Ave Los Angeles.

23:14.056 --> 23:18.313
It looks like a kind of data sheet,
to create a video clip...

23:18.511 --> 23:21.550
that held tomorrow in LA.
Hartsfield Productions.

23:22.807 --> 23:24.311
Where do I know that name from?

23:24.568 --> 23:27.177
Jerry Hartfield, he was producer of
'Grave Encounters'

23:27.434 --> 23:30.009
data sheet that is printed...

23:30.265 --> 23:32.475
for a video, he
tomorrow recording.

23:32.732 --> 23:34.810
You can not just go to LA for two days.

23:35.067 --> 23:38.890
And our movie?
- This is important to me.

23:39.147 --> 23:43.065
you really fly all the way to LA,
for a data sheet?

23:43.322 --> 23:46.895
Come on, I'm only two days away.
I see the problem.

23:47.152 --> 23:48.702
Do what you want.

24:02.382 --> 24:07.043
movie now outside the car,
and we are in LA.

24:07.300 --> 24:12.206
Hollywood.
The film Mecca on Earth.

24:12.462 --> 24:15.600
I would not say that it is beautiful,
because there is a lot of smog, but...

24:17.551 --> 24:20.887
We are now in the studio.

24:21.144 --> 24:23.466
Hi, Hartfield Productions?

24:23.723 --> 24:27.560
Your name?
- Roberto Smith. I have this...

24:28.317 --> 24:31.641
I got this info for my
appointment today.

24:31.898 --> 24:33.266
a video clip.

24:33.488 --> 24:37.852
Okay, Roberto, but within a row,
and park on level C.

24:38.109 --> 24:40.500
Thank you.
- Okay ..

24:53.462 --> 24:57.434
Film Crew.

25:10.517 --> 25:13.567
That's him, that's Jerry Hartfield.

25:15.729 --> 25:17.598
Cut.

25:17.855 --> 25:20.970
Guys, where's the confetti?
We run two hours behind schedule, ahead.

25:21.227 --> 25:22.596
again.

25:22.819 --> 25:25.893
I head toward Jerry,
and try to talk to him.

25:28.915 --> 25:30.659
Excuse me, sir Hartsfield?

25:30.823 --> 25:33.270
Can I talk to you?
- One second.

25:33.527 --> 25:38.031
Who are you?
- Alex Wright, I film a documentary.

25:38.088 --> 25:39.485
I was wondering if you wanted to give
an interview?

25:39.708 --> 25:40.900
You find yourself on my set.

25:41.123 --> 25:43.750
You can stop, because I give
no damn interview.

25:43.807 --> 25:47.122
Security, this man does not belong here.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.559
I know of "Grave Encounters".
I know what you did.

25:49.616 --> 25:52.426
Take him away.
- I know what you did.

25:54.759 --> 25:57.205
I just tried to
with Jerry Hartsfield talking.

25:57.462 --> 26:01.894
He left the security put me out.
He obviously hiding something.

26:04.565 --> 26:07.647
I know not what I can do
more.

26:13.482 --> 26:14.977
Yes?

26:15.234 --> 26:19.390
I will talk to you.
But not here, not for a camera.

26:19.646 --> 26:23.200
Come tomorrow at two o'clock
to my office.

26:23.774 --> 26:26.296
Okay, fine, thank you.

26:31.898 --> 26:33.700
Success.

26:36.250 --> 26:40.533
Test 1, 2, 3.

26:40.789 --> 26:43.000
This will be a good shot.

26:49.052 --> 26:51.395
Hartfield Productions.
How can I help?

26:51.396 --> 26:53.199
I have an appointment with Jerry,
at 14:00.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.118
Alex?
- That's right.

26:55.119 --> 26:57.556
Register.

26:59.979 --> 27:03.523
How do you know?
Tell me honestly.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.768
I know 'Grave Encounters'
was real.

27:08.025 --> 27:10.262
And Sean Rogerson
and the rest of the team is dead.

27:10.263 --> 27:11.642
For the record...

27:11.737 --> 27:13.961
unless your body is found,
you are legally not dead...

27:14.349 --> 27:16.941
but a missing person.
Thank God.

27:17.198 --> 27:20.903
So you admit it, the images are real.
- Yes, every frame is real.

27:20.904 --> 27:22.169
some cheap visual effects after...

27:22.392 --> 27:23.981
we at the last moment
added.

27:23.982 --> 27:26.678
What about the families?

27:26.679 --> 27:29.494
There is something called
a "confidentiality agreement".

27:29.751 --> 27:31.396
Do you have a confidentiality agreement signed
?

27:31.452 --> 27:35.907
course, and arrange for some extra money, they signed
only too happy.

27:36.164 --> 27:39.073
You probably think I
a big asshole, right?

27:39.330 --> 27:42.205
I can not understand why you did it.

27:42.462 --> 27:44.053
When I
images for the first time saw...

27:44.054 --> 27:45.456
scared me to death.

27:45.679 --> 27:48.469
Do you understand that?
I wanted to destroy them first.

27:49.726 --> 27:52.054
But after all settlements
I sat on the edge of bankruptcy.

27:52.055 --> 27:54.606
So, then I got an idea.

27:54.607 --> 27:58.281
Why not release it as a movie?
Maybe we can recoup the cost?

27:58.538 --> 28:00.857
And it worked, because they want a sequel.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.620
'Grave Encounters 2'
Can you believe that?

28:03.621 --> 28:06.222
directors The Vicious Brothers.
Who are they?

28:08.445 --> 28:11.000
Why do not you join me?

28:13.494 --> 28:15.317
Meet The Vicious Brothers.

28:15.574 --> 28:17.728
Day, Jerry.

28:17.985 --> 28:20.570
This is Colin.
And that is Stuart.

28:20.827 --> 28:22.577
are my interns.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.135
I pretended
the directors of the film were.

28:25.415 --> 28:27.784
They arrange everything with the press, and because they are not union
sit...

28:27.976 --> 28:30.100
I do not have to pay them.

28:31.048 --> 28:34.795
You get all the students from UCLA.

28:35.052 --> 28:38.671
And those of USC, and they are extremely rude.
Now you know the truth.

28:38.672 --> 28:41.085
You can not get away.
- We already done.

28:41.342 --> 28:42.682
I will tell to everyone.

28:42.739 --> 28:45.469
Go ahead, who will listen to you?
You're a nobody.

28:45.470 --> 28:47.110
The only reason I agreed
went with this conversation...

28:47.333 --> 28:49.021
was to see whether you
evidence against me.

28:49.022 --> 28:52.260
What you did not.
- I guess we'll see.

28:52.517 --> 28:54.945
We shall then see.
You may go now.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.770
What an asshole.

28:59.027 --> 29:01.433
Who will listen to you?
You're a nobody.

29:01.690 --> 29:04.318
So that's why I had to go.

29:04.575 --> 29:07.703
If this is true, then it is disturbed.
- I did not ask.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.406
What an asshole.

29:10.663 --> 29:14.762
Yes, but he is also right. Because nobody
will believe us, we need proof.

29:15.619 --> 29:17.120
What do you mean by "evidence"?

29:17.377 --> 29:19.323
I've been thinking about...

29:19.580 --> 29:21.491
and this is the movie I want to make.

29:21.748 --> 29:24.960
Think about it, we are
already well under way.

29:25.216 --> 29:28.038
You have it all filmed with your phone.

29:28.295 --> 29:29.339
And you've also filmed.

29:29.488 --> 29:32.857
It's a documentary, but also
a horror movie, right?

29:33.885 --> 29:35.051
Why is it a horror movie?

29:35.052 --> 29:36.837
I received a new message from
"Death Awaits".

29:37.094 --> 29:39.206
He lives in Canada, next to the hospital...

29:39.207 --> 29:40.820
Grave Encounters where they have filmed.

29:40.821 --> 29:45.075
why he knows so much from,
and he wants us into the building meet.

29:45.076 --> 29:48.899
There we find our evidence.
- You want to drive to Canada?

29:48.900 --> 29:52.094
It is a 2 hour drive, we take
Jerry and Tessa with...

29:52.095 --> 29:53.940
and filming everything.

29:54.697 --> 29:57.747
It's a fucking movie, man.
For the 15th time...

29:57.748 --> 30:00.429
I do not drive all the way to Canada
for a crazy idea.

30:00.586 --> 30:02.273
I'll go.
- Seriously?

30:02.495 --> 30:04.324
Can you explain this?

30:04.581 --> 30:06.904
No, but...
- Why did he do that?

30:07.161 --> 30:08.849
I do not know.

30:09.106 --> 30:10.614
Are you in?
You go anyway, right?

30:10.615 --> 30:12.706
photography credit.

30:12.962 --> 30:14.649
You're in?
- Yes, let's do this.

30:14.706 --> 30:17.041
You're my producer,
I need you there.

30:17.298 --> 30:20.755
You can go to Sundance with this material.
This will put us on the map.

30:20.756 --> 30:22.762
Trust me.

30:25.288 --> 30:27.236
Okay.

30:29.683 --> 30:33.096
December 3, 2011

30:39.233 --> 30:42.056
You should give us another time about what
'Grave Encounters' tell.

30:42.313 --> 30:47.313
We are on the way to... hospital.

30:47.570 --> 30:49.727
We're here, right?

30:49.984 --> 30:52.107
How do you know?
- Take it.

30:58.248 --> 31:03.170
Is it illegal to
marijuana across the border to bring?

31:03.427 --> 31:04.716
That is definitely illegal.

31:04.939 --> 31:07.708
I thought Canada had
tolerance?

31:07.965 --> 31:11.700
you kidding?
- Alex go to the side, we have to dump something.

31:16.761 --> 31:19.876
You like to be.
I see it in your eyes.

31:20.133 --> 31:22.560
Do you know the way to... hospital?

31:25.935 --> 31:29.860
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Vancouver.

31:31.517 --> 31:34.812
The forest is closed.

31:35.069 --> 31:38.432
I shall open.
- She's going to open.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.624
That is a tough bitch.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.573
You're kidding.
- See this?

31:50.830 --> 31:54.485
Alex, they have certainly managed
a creepy building to building.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.704
Jesus Christ, this place is huge.

31:56.961 --> 32:00.200
Alex, you know exactly where they
have filmed?

32:00.457 --> 32:04.400
I think it was here,
let's take a look.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.907
the Canadian police.

32:14.864 --> 32:19.006
Seriously?
- Guys, let me do the talking.

32:19.263 --> 32:21.600
Say nothing.

32:25.242 --> 32:28.562
Excuse me, this is private property
Did you see the sign?

32:28.819 --> 32:31.600
Sorry.
- Hello, sorry. We are film students.

32:31.857 --> 32:34.475
We just want a few shots
for our school.

32:34.698 --> 32:37.436
We just want to make some images
from the outside, that's all.

32:37.693 --> 32:39.272
Sorry, but this
buildings are full of asbestos.

32:39.529 --> 32:41.368
That is very dangerous.
You gotta get outta here.

32:41.369 --> 32:44.784
Turn the camera off.
- No, absolutely not.

32:45.041 --> 32:47.403
You may not filming.
You can not film in this area.

32:47.660 --> 32:48.737
I understand.
We al

32:48.960 --> 32:50.990
Give me the tape.
- I do not care.

32:51.247 --> 32:54.463
Give the tapes from the cameras.
Specify the tape.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.864
Damn.
- Keep driving, Alex.

33:06.165 --> 33:08.465
Keep driving.
- What was that guy?

33:08.766 --> 33:10.066
What an asshole.

33:10.085 --> 33:13.840
Why would an agent do?
- I do not know.

33:14.097 --> 33:15.548
Would he be a kind of guard?

33:18.271 --> 33:19.676
What are you doing?

33:19.899 --> 33:21.619
We are thrown,
on our first day.

33:22.613 --> 33:25.158
Here it is.

33:26.673 --> 33:31.094
We just try to make recordings,
the outside of the hospital.

33:31.352 --> 33:33.359
But we were attacked
by a guard.

33:33.616 --> 33:37.318
That our cameras trying to tackle.
He said because "asbestos".

33:39.249 --> 33:42.071
That was clearly lied.
They try to hide the truth.

33:42.328 --> 33:43.612
They're trying to hide something.

33:43.835 --> 33:46.323
They do not want anyone...

33:46.580 --> 33:49.637
We are unstoppable.
- Fuck the police.

33:50.794 --> 33:53.000
Enough, guys.

33:56.134 --> 33:58.169
This movie is retarded.

33:58.427 --> 34:00.751
This is why you are here?
Julie think this is real?

34:01.008 --> 34:04.178
That's what it's all about, Tessa.

34:04.435 --> 34:06.222
I am not responsible for my actions.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.100
I received a new message
of 'Dead Awaits'.

34:08.166 --> 34:13.675
It says that we meet him in the room
in the western tunnel, at 03:00 tonight.

34:13.803 --> 34:15.364
We...

34:16.166 --> 34:21.359
8 cameras with night vision,
we go draw around the building.

34:21.389 --> 34:25.523
This mega camera with high resolution.

34:25.780 --> 34:29.800
A thermal camera.
And an EMF meter.

34:32.081 --> 34:33.527
That's what she said.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.177
Tonight we will try to find evidence...

34:37.434 --> 34:40.790
what Jerry Hartsfield 10 years
trying to hide.

34:41.047 --> 34:46.304
But this film, really.
The spiritual world exists.

34:46.339 --> 34:49.998
And the team of 'Grave Encounters' died
during an attempt to capture.

35:06.443 --> 35:08.151
Here we go.
- Let's do this.

35:11.194 --> 35:13.654
Damn, it's the guard.

35:13.911 --> 35:15.365
Duck.

35:15.992 --> 35:18.000
Jerry, turn off the lights.
- Turn off the light.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.326
Is someone there?

35:26.583 --> 35:28.738
Duck.

35:29.639 --> 35:31.039
Hello?

35:38.840 --> 35:41.259
Okay, I'm on my way.

35:43.160 --> 35:46.860
Okay, go.
- You heard it, now run.

35:47.551 --> 35:49.405
Do something softer.

35:51.685 --> 35:56.783
Wait for me.
- Do not leave me, all those ghosts here.

35:59.183 --> 36:01.513
"Death Awaits".
- "Death Awaits".

36:01.736 --> 36:05.458
It's definitely the right building.
Tess, bolt cutter.

36:05.989 --> 36:10.712
No, I'm doing this.
- Whatever you want.

36:20.823 --> 36:24.438
you serious?
- My God.

36:26.828 --> 36:28.375
This place is not scary.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.796
My God, is that police tape?

36:34.053 --> 36:36.533
Why would the police come here
but if this was a movie?

36:37.090 --> 36:38.960
Because this is not just a movie.

36:41.017 --> 36:44.005
Are you ready?
This hall scares me.

36:44.228 --> 36:48.783
Yeah, I'm so ready.
Okay.

36:50.899 --> 36:54.582
Okay, it's okay.
- Okay, let's go.

36:57.739 --> 36:59.785
<i> Camera 1: Ground floor, East Hall </ i></i>

36:59.842 --> 37:01.487
That way.
- That side? okay.

37:08.914 --> 37:11.860
Demons in the corridor,
demons in my head.

37:12.117 --> 37:13.261
Demons...

37:13.284 --> 37:15.537
Okay, let's go.
We go.

37:16.993 --> 37:18.537
Okay, let's go.

37:18.953 --> 37:20.570
<i> Camera 2: Third floor
patient room. </ I></i>

37:20.627 --> 37:22.805
hurry.
- Wait for me.

37:29.204 --> 37:31.700
Hey, this is where the black die?

37:31.957 --> 37:36.557
Yeah, well the ethnic always go first death.

37:37.796 --> 37:39.954
<i> Camera 5: Third floor, bathroom </ i></i>

37:42.711 --> 37:46.958
Damn man, that's really high.

37:47.215 --> 37:49.081
Come on, man. Let's go.

37:49.838 --> 37:52.135
Soon you fall into it.

37:52.392 --> 37:53.778
Okay, guys, we're going to make the intro.

37:53.835 --> 37:55.857
<i> Camera 7: Fourth floor, Window Room </ i></i>

38:08.924 --> 38:11.943
<i> Room 8: Sub-Level, Tunnels </ i></i>

38:13.912 --> 38:14.956
I can not say.
- Yes, you can.

38:15.144 --> 38:17.693
Alex are crazy documentary,
Take One.

38:17.950 --> 38:19.995
Ready?

38:20.252 --> 38:22.580
It was on March 20, 2002.

38:22.837 --> 38:25.128
Sean Rogerson and a team
of 'Grave Encounters'...

38:25.385 --> 38:28.578
filmed their
sixth episode of a reality series.

38:28.835 --> 38:32.130
in the same building.

38:32.386 --> 38:37.417
They found something terrible, something that
their lives tragically inkorte.

38:37.517 --> 38:42.563
It was sold to the American public
as fiction, but it was actually...

38:42.564 --> 38:46.286
reality.

38:46.485 --> 38:49.055
Later tonight we will meet
an anonymous source...

38:49.155 --> 38:51.724
known only as "Death Awaits".

38:51.824 --> 38:53.559
He was the one who tipped us.

38:53.659 --> 38:57.046
And in the meantime we will
our paranormal research.

38:57.146 --> 39:02.348
Hoping to uncover the truth
after a decade of concealment.

39:04.504 --> 39:07.131
Is everybody ready?
- Yes.

39:07.132 --> 39:08.450
Tess did you?
- Yes.

39:08.550 --> 39:13.472
And 3, 2, 1... Action.

39:13.473 --> 39:17.893
This building is huge
and is super easy to get lost.

39:17.894 --> 39:19.922
So
to ensure that this does not happen...

39:20.022 --> 39:25.089
and we always find our way back,
let this glow-sticks fall behind us.

39:26.989 --> 39:30.033
We have these military GPS.

39:30.034 --> 39:33.897
That we bought in a spy shop,
in case...

39:33.997 --> 39:39.083
one of us, the group lost.
Are we all this.

39:39.084 --> 39:41.403
Damn, blondie. I have headphones on.

39:41.503 --> 39:44.698
Sorry, I think it's safe to say...

39:44.798 --> 39:49.899
that we are well prepared for the worst.

39:55.227 --> 39:58.815
This is the bath, where T. C Gibson...

39:58.816 --> 40:02.304
aka actor Merwin Mondesir, was slain.

40:02.404 --> 40:05.189
Now we try to communicate with the spirit world
.

40:05.289 --> 40:07.266
In the hope that we can achieve Merwin.

40:07.366 --> 40:10.619
I take it, on my recorder.

40:10.620 --> 40:15.317
the spirit of Merwin Mondesir here with us,
speak freely.

40:15.417 --> 40:19.227
Do not worry, I'm sure your wife and your daughter
like something you want to hear.

40:21.728 --> 40:26.901
the spirit of Merwin Mondesir here with us,
speak freely.

40:27.001 --> 40:32.824
Do not worry, I'm sure your wife and your daughter
like something you want to hear.

40:36.498 --> 40:38.870
Great.
- Fuck.

40:39.193 --> 40:43.097
If there are ghosts here with us
speak freely.

40:43.197 --> 40:46.102
Give us a sign, make some noise.

40:46.202 --> 40:49.538
Create a cold place.

40:49.539 --> 40:52.551
Jack, grab the thermal camera.
- Yes.

40:53.752 --> 40:57.141
Okay, yeah.

41:00.592 --> 41:04.414
Man... what the hell?

41:04.514 --> 41:10.563
There is a strange haze behind Trevor.
- You mean... let me see.

41:11.064 --> 41:14.357
I told you this was real.
- What is it?

41:14.358 --> 41:17.507
Let no farting, asshole.

41:18.008 --> 41:21.108
Is it visible on the thermal camera?
- Yes.

41:21.658 --> 41:24.714
Look again.
- Trevor.

41:26.538 --> 41:28.981
You did it, you're a beast.

41:29.082 --> 41:31.015
That's really mature.
- This is insane.

41:31.216 --> 41:33.916
So, what do you think?

41:35.256 --> 41:39.453
This is the tunnel where Sean Rogerson
his last moments in life were spent.

41:39.553 --> 41:41.972
Crazy become pain...

41:41.973 --> 41:46.127
of hunger,
as you get deeper into the tunnels running...

41:46.227 --> 41:50.465
is like you deeper and deeper into the depths of madness
comes.

41:50.565 --> 41:55.511
Taken literally, the tension
in this building, at every step.

41:55.611 --> 41:58.392
What?
- I think it's a bit exaggerated.

41:58.692 --> 42:01.796
What is it exaggerated?
- You should not exaggerate too much about madness.

42:02.497 --> 42:04.697
I get it.

42:05.457 --> 42:07.150
Guys, look.

42:07.751 --> 42:10.295
Jack, take this on.
- Yeah, man.

42:10.296 --> 42:14.492
Seriously, what does this. Why do they do
on the ground?. It's disgusting.

42:14.592 --> 42:17.620
He said we had to meet in
the room, west of the tunnel.

42:17.720 --> 42:20.218
And it does not go further west than this.

42:22.468 --> 42:25.838
What time is it?
- 03:25.

42:26.939 --> 42:28.695
Maybe he's just a little later.

42:28.795 --> 42:30.951
He's just not
without him we have nothing.

42:31.051 --> 42:35.460
The whole project will be a disaster.

42:39.161 --> 42:42.982
What's this?
- No, this is a spirit board.

42:43.082 --> 42:45.527
A what?
- You lay your hand on a piece...

42:45.627 --> 42:48.490
and then try your spirits to communicate
using the letters.

42:48.590 --> 42:52.909
Come on, we have to play.
- This will never work.

42:53.009 --> 42:55.704
Yes, yes.
We do the two of us.

42:55.804 --> 42:58.291
I talk to the spirits of...

42:58.391 --> 43:03.629
we know that many of you here
were mistreated and abused...

43:03.729 --> 43:08.067
and so therefore angry
in the afterlife.

43:08.068 --> 43:10.908
Are there ghosts here with us now?

43:15.509 --> 43:16.909
It's not really...

43:16.995 --> 43:21.147
Do you think
- No, do you?

43:22.321 --> 43:25.622
Who does it?
- I do not.

43:26.123 --> 43:27.823
Sit me not to besodemieteren.
- I do not.

43:27.923 --> 43:32.579
I do not.
- Okay, who are we talking about?

43:32.679 --> 43:34.290
Give me a name?

43:35.891 --> 43:39.046
My God boys.
- Okay, stop.

43:39.346 --> 43:42.356
D. .. E. ..

43:43.257 --> 43:47.028
A. .. T. .. H. ..

43:48.329 --> 43:52.492
A. .. W. .. A. .. I. .. T. .. S

43:53.160 --> 43:55.270
Damn. "Death Awaits"
is not a person.

43:55.370 --> 43:58.831
this State on YouTube guys?
- This is really weird.

43:58.832 --> 44:00.680
What do you want us to do?

44:07.091 --> 44:09.859
My God, what he says.

44:12.684 --> 44:14.584
Take everything.

44:15.185 --> 44:18.448
Take everything.
- Yes, of course.

44:18.855 --> 44:21.441
Damn, all backwards.

44:21.442 --> 44:23.674
Guys seriously, this is not a joke.

44:25.075 --> 44:26.475
Are you okay?

44:36.626 --> 44:38.599
What the hell happened?

44:47.845 --> 44:50.081
Got anything filmed?
- Yeah, I got it.

44:50.181 --> 44:52.225
Alex, I can not fucking believe it.

44:52.226 --> 44:54.590
Okay, what was that?
- What is it?

44:57.691 --> 45:00.776
Great.
- I told you to keep your mouth.

45:01.277 --> 45:02.877
What the hell was that?

45:07.212 --> 45:10.980
not move. Okay. It's good.

45:11.080 --> 45:13.233
you realize that breaking
a criminal offense?

45:13.333 --> 45:15.514
you think I would not see that broken lock?

45:15.914 --> 45:18.195
I understand,
but I'm not leaving without my stuff.

45:18.295 --> 45:19.946
It is not even mine, it's
of our school.

45:19.966 --> 45:23.387
I do not care who it is?
That you discuss it with the police.

45:23.388 --> 45:25.597
God, do not be a jerk.

45:25.598 --> 45:30.226
Shut up.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

45:30.227 --> 45:33.022
He's not.
- You're not a cop

45:33.023 --> 45:34.356
Trevor, shut up.

45:34.357 --> 45:37.692
Thank you, now listen to your friend.

45:37.693 --> 45:40.736
Sir, you do not...

45:40.737 --> 45:43.315
Damn?
- What the hell was that.

45:44.616 --> 45:45.783
Okay, who's there?

45:45.784 --> 45:48.747
Nobody.
- Nonsense. Who else is here?

45:48.748 --> 45:51.875
There's nobody else here.
- Something strange is happening this building.

45:51.876 --> 45:54.269
And I do not know what it is...
- What are you talking about?

45:54.270 --> 45:56.490
I do not know.
- This place is haunted, man.

45:56.491 --> 45:58.925
Do me a favor?
Okay, now you all...

45:58.926 --> 46:03.221
stay here and do not move.

46:03.222 --> 46:07.259
You really should not go up.
- Weapon there and act tough.

46:07.360 --> 46:10.768
Do you want him now?
Shut up and stay here.

46:17.405 --> 46:20.157
Let's get out of here, man.
- No, we can not leave...

46:20.158 --> 46:22.743
If we go now...
- Yeah, come on.

46:22.744 --> 46:24.620
If I go, I leave behind...

46:24.621 --> 46:26.497
the stuff of the University,
$ 50,000 to cameras.

46:26.498 --> 46:28.332
If you stay, you will be arrested.

46:28.333 --> 46:32.879
If you want to leave, go ahead.
I stay, if I do not have the camera and recording...

46:32.880 --> 46:34.464
I have no movie?

46:34.465 --> 46:36.236
Then I fucking movie.

46:39.137 --> 46:41.437
Were those gunshots?
- Yes, that was it.

46:41.598 --> 46:44.142
No, Alex stay here.

46:44.143 --> 46:46.728
Man, let's go.
- Where are you going?

46:46.729 --> 46:49.581
He can hurt.
- He's an asshole.

46:49.582 --> 46:51.405
Come on!

46:56.498 --> 46:59.541
Hello?
Are you here?

47:16.679 --> 47:18.502
Are you okay?

47:22.518 --> 47:27.522
're kidding.
- We gotta go.

47:27.523 --> 47:30.262
I agree with her,
we gotta get outta here.

47:30.863 --> 47:34.073
Wait, we make two groups,
then it goes faster.

47:34.074 --> 47:35.616
you serious?
This is stupid, Alex.

47:35.617 --> 47:37.952
Why the hell should we split?
- Just go fast.

47:37.953 --> 47:39.787
Tes, as we all do,
takes longer.

47:39.788 --> 47:44.793
Fuck you, I will not walk alone.
- Pull yourself. Go Tes.

47:44.794 --> 47:47.462
the camera.
- Are you crazy?

47:47.463 --> 47:51.550
Why are you against it every time?
Why do not we just.

47:51.551 --> 47:54.847
So incredibly stupid,
I do not think we do now.

47:54.848 --> 47:56.785
Can you keep that flashlight there.

47:58.986 --> 48:00.974
Can you please hurry up?

48:07.819 --> 48:12.376
Shoot.
- Take it easy.

48:16.093 --> 48:18.522
Tessa, I found the room.

48:19.123 --> 48:23.086
Where are you?
- At the end of the corridor.

48:23.087 --> 48:24.877
Where?

48:33.223 --> 48:37.195
Damn.

48:45.070 --> 48:49.128
Tessa, come here.

48:52.913 --> 48:57.260
What are you doing?

49:01.461 --> 49:05.560
Jerry, where are you?

49:05.967 --> 49:07.668
My God, Jerry.

49:12.140 --> 49:16.727
Guys, I need help.
Guys hello.

49:19.660 --> 49:21.160
What the hell happened?

49:21.361 --> 49:24.195
I do not know, I heard a bang,
and then he was gone, he must have fallen.

49:24.196 --> 49:29.909
What, what happened?
- He must have fought with anything.

49:29.910 --> 49:31.867
The camera recorded it.

49:37.668 --> 49:39.768
Did you see that? Did you see that fucking.

49:41.526 --> 49:44.635
I want to fuck away.
- Tessa, we gotta go.

49:44.636 --> 49:46.360
Come on.

49:49.808 --> 49:52.035
output, come on here is an output.

49:52.936 --> 49:55.780
Call 911
- It does not work, I have no coverage.

49:55.781 --> 49:58.065
Keep moving, we call when we get outside.
Come on.

49:58.066 --> 50:00.195
Jerry's fucking dead.

50:02.196 --> 50:04.267
What?
- Goddamn.

50:05.368 --> 50:07.019
Here there is no fucking exit.

50:07.620 --> 50:10.914
This is not impossible, look at the glow-sticks.

50:10.915 --> 50:13.417
Maybe the guard moved them.
That is not possible.

50:13.418 --> 50:15.858
Why would the guard do?
- I do not know.

50:19.049 --> 50:21.606
Calm down.
- Shoot.

50:22.507 --> 50:24.207
Where the hell are you.

50:27.476 --> 50:29.687
Okay, it says here that we are here.

50:29.688 --> 50:31.898
Two steps down that way.

50:31.899 --> 50:34.400
This stands on its head,
the exit is that way.

50:34.401 --> 50:37.026
We are on the fourth floor.
- What are you talking about?

50:37.027 --> 50:41.198
Alex, do you look up here for?
- What's the point?

50:41.199 --> 50:43.742
So we can find an exit.

50:43.743 --> 50:48.758
You do not understand,
that card is useless.

50:53.921 --> 50:58.438
My god, this place looks terrible.

51:13.278 --> 51:17.686
Look, would also have been children?

51:21.120 --> 51:25.134
I'll go first.

51:42.741 --> 51:45.505
Do you see that?
- Yes.

51:46.700 --> 51:50.084
He moves.
Take this down?

51:50.307 --> 51:53.464
Trevor, come back.
- Trevor stay there. Trevor stop.

51:54.473 --> 51:56.097
...

51:59.648 --> 52:01.568
What is she doing here?

52:02.796 --> 52:07.795
Hi, I'm Kaitlin.
What is your name?

52:08.052 --> 52:10.433
Will you play with me?

52:12.602 --> 52:14.474
Or do you...

52:29.198 --> 52:31.657
Guys wait.
Slower. Tessa.

52:35.676 --> 52:37.475
Tessa.
- What the hell?

52:37.698 --> 52:40.796
What, what is it?

52:43.173 --> 52:44.773
Did you hear that?
- Tessa.

52:55.257 --> 52:57.402
Where the hell are you?

53:09.745 --> 53:12.309
Fuck.
Leave me alone.

53:36.011 --> 53:41.262
How does this thing work?
Come on.

53:42.644 --> 53:44.895
Boys.

53:47.899 --> 53:50.921
Alex.
Oh God.

53:57.201 --> 54:01.515
Boys.
Where are you?

54:14.020 --> 54:17.310
touch me.
Do not touch me.

54:22.411 --> 54:24.611
Stay the fuck away from me.

54:54.334 --> 54:56.914
My name is Alex Wright.

54:57.170 --> 54:59.741
This is Jennifer Parker and
that's Trevor Thompson.

54:59.998 --> 55:03.994
We came here to find evidence
the movie Grave Encounters real.

55:04.217 --> 55:06.963
fuck all really.

55:07.220 --> 55:13.131
We have Jerry and Tessa already lost.
I do not think they have found.

55:13.388 --> 55:17.300
Do not say that.

55:17.523 --> 55:20.595
There must be a reason why the
has brought us here.

55:20.852 --> 55:24.057
Why you have brought me here?

55:24.314 --> 55:26.858
I do not understand.

55:27.115 --> 55:31.111
He wants me to film everything, but...

55:31.368 --> 55:34.730
I do not know why...
- Turn the fucking camera off.

55:34.953 --> 55:36.663
Somebody turn off the camera.

55:45.714 --> 55:49.122
I let anything happen to you, okay?

55:49.379 --> 55:51.159
done nothing to you.

56:04.150 --> 56:06.712
Why do we fuck up?

56:13.058 --> 56:17.290
What is that?
- Alex, please do not go inside.

56:18.412 --> 56:20.004
What if Tessa?

56:20.958 --> 56:22.804
That's not it.

56:26.664 --> 56:30.437
Turn it off, Alex.
Turn it off.

56:31.738 --> 56:34.338
Turn it off fucking.

56:36.263 --> 56:38.237
the guard.

56:44.936 --> 56:46.917
Is he dead?

56:48.691 --> 56:50.302
I think so.

56:55.112 --> 56:56.757
Turn it off, please.

57:00.818 --> 57:02.757
Get it off me, please.

57:36.216 --> 57:39.431
Why were we so stupid to come here?

57:41.979 --> 57:45.096
I can not believe it.

57:49.296 --> 57:50.958
Guys, look.

57:51.497 --> 57:53.469
It seems so loose.

57:53.692 --> 57:56.462
What? Okay let's go.
Hurry.

57:59.296 --> 58:02.413
Do not just stand there, give me a crowbar.

58:02.670 --> 58:04.912
Shoot.
Come on.

58:09.622 --> 58:12.002
Come on Sean. Come on.

58:12.746 --> 58:15.998
Damn.
Okay, let's...

58:18.135 --> 58:20.618
Let's just leave...

58:28.281 --> 58:31.669
We must return
... - Come on.

58:33.828 --> 58:35.341
Racing.

58:48.386 --> 58:50.383
Racing.
- Come on Jen, come on.

58:59.892 --> 59:01.525
outta boys.

59:05.817 --> 59:08.352
Jerry.

59:09.630 --> 59:11.497
We should go.

59:23.739 --> 59:25.536
Take that damn camera.

59:33.543 --> 59:36.583
We came out of the building.
We fucking met.

59:36.806 --> 59:40.801
Did you see that?
I told you it was real.

59:45.978 --> 59:48.718
Alex.
- Alex what the hell are you doing?

59:48.975 --> 59:50.526
Alex, come here.

59:55.312 --> 59:59.393
They are dead.
- Think not, grab your stuff.

59:59.822 --> 01:00:03.404
We must do something,
we can not just go.

01:00:03.661 --> 01:00:05.401
I do not know what to do.

01:00:14.796 --> 01:00:16.671
Come on, hurry up.

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:44.392
I do not know why you so obsessed
was through that damn movie.

01:00:45.533 --> 01:00:48.064
Sorry, I did not
everything that would happen.

01:00:48.321 --> 01:00:49.995
Tessa's probably dead.

01:00:51.288 --> 01:00:55.710
You and your damn project.
- Keep your own mouth.

01:00:58.724 --> 01:01:00.556
What the hell?

01:01:04.342 --> 01:01:07.310
No. We were in the hotel.

01:01:07.533 --> 01:01:10.599
Do not. That is useless.
- We were in the building.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:12.537
What do you mean in the building?

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.053
Everyone in the building is going
fucking dead.

01:01:20.289 --> 01:01:22.219
Pack your bag, okay?

01:01:35.788 --> 01:01:39.152
No, I do not wanna go.
- You have to walk.

01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:43.786
This is nonsense. Where do we go now?

01:01:52.512 --> 01:01:54.851
I will not fucking die.

01:01:56.743 --> 01:01:58.654
Then everything for nothing.

01:02:00.686 --> 01:02:04.469
I think it anytime from spinning.

01:02:29.425 --> 01:02:33.725
What the hell is that?
Are you okay?

01:02:35.926 --> 01:02:38.915
Jennifer.
- Alex, where are you?

01:02:39.178 --> 01:02:40.903
Where the hell are you, Jenny?

01:02:43.268 --> 01:02:46.414
Jennifer, where are you?
- I'm here.

01:02:47.015 --> 01:02:49.115
Trevor, converts the thermal camera.

01:02:51.399 --> 01:02:57.441
Can you see anything?
- Forward, walk toward my voice.

01:02:57.898 --> 01:02:59.659
I'm here.

01:03:00.366 --> 01:03:03.610
this way.
I'm here.

01:03:14.455 --> 01:03:17.485
What do you see?
- What is it?

01:03:20.942 --> 01:03:23.493
Turn that light off.

01:03:23.716 --> 01:03:25.250
Please help us.

01:03:26.598 --> 01:03:29.200
Please.
- Follow me, come on.

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:39.798
it.

01:03:45.491 --> 01:03:47.297
Shoot.

01:03:51.588 --> 01:03:53.518
Trevor, is that you behind me?

01:03:56.167 --> 01:03:57.784
Get out.

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:03.743
Guys, wait up.
My foot's stuck.

01:04:03.862 --> 01:04:05.451
Guys, wait up.

01:04:19.509 --> 01:04:21.256
What the hell?

01:04:24.442 --> 01:04:28.428
Trevor. My God.
Where were you? What's happened to you?

01:04:32.712 --> 01:04:36.231
What happened?
- I do not wanna talk about it.

01:04:36.488 --> 01:04:38.084
Who are you?

01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:41.409
you live here?

01:04:51.467 --> 01:04:53.009
Wait...

01:04:54.555 --> 01:04:58.221
You're Lance Preston.
Sean Rogerson actor anyway?

01:04:58.642 --> 01:05:01.437
Lived you all the time?

01:05:13.113 --> 01:05:15.193
What's he doing?

01:05:19.494 --> 01:05:23.105
Hello buddy. You're my friend, right?

01:05:29.771 --> 01:05:33.453
My God.
I think I will puke.

01:05:36.969 --> 01:05:38.639
Want some?

01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:43.253
You must help us to find a way out of this cursed
building.

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:45.077
Are you a patient?

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.122
What?
All patients?

01:05:49.337 --> 01:05:51.091
Where was your husband?

01:05:52.274 --> 01:05:55.164
Sean, we are not patients.
We are film students...

01:05:55.421 --> 01:05:56.957
we broke into the building.

01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:00.393
Why?
Why would you do that?

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:05.598
I must know the truth about your movie.

01:06:06.116 --> 01:06:09.010
What movie?

01:06:12.458 --> 01:06:15.970
Good evening and welcome to another episode of
Grave Encounters.

01:06:16.796 --> 01:06:18.993
Your Grave Encounters movie...
.

01:06:24.889 --> 01:06:26.649
Ashley.

01:06:33.763 --> 01:06:37.708
There must be a way out, something.
You must know something.

01:06:37.808 --> 01:06:41.113
Katie has the keys.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.023
not fucking touch me.

01:06:46.024 --> 01:06:48.845
She comes to us,
wait a few more days.

01:06:48.945 --> 01:06:50.531
She does not listen to me.

01:06:50.831 --> 01:06:53.718
She committed suicide.
She's not for you.

01:06:54.118 --> 01:06:58.749
You must know something, you've been here nine years.
A vent, a fucking window, anything.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.377
2 days, 11 hours.

01:07:03.378 --> 01:07:04.404
nine months, two days 11 hours.

01:07:04.504 --> 01:07:08.283
Think you here for 9 months now.
You've been here nine years...

01:07:08.383 --> 01:07:10.552
not nine months, you understand?

01:07:11.553 --> 01:07:13.289
your mom, okay,
I met your mother.

01:07:13.389 --> 01:07:16.210
A nice lady.
Nice lady, but she is very sick.

01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:20.102
Your mother is very ill.
- Shut up.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.266
Trev, wake up.

01:07:37.667 --> 01:07:40.111
Alex, why do you film this?

01:07:40.211 --> 01:07:43.762
This guy is completely insane.
- Look, it's like a psychopath.

01:07:44.963 --> 01:07:47.163
10 years on this fucking place.

01:07:47.252 --> 01:07:52.738
Why did you give him a pair of scissors?
- He does not do anything, it's okay.

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:58.219
I do not trust him.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.820
Sean, what are these drawings?

01:08:10.579 --> 01:08:12.468
That's the door.

01:08:16.169 --> 01:08:17.769
Is not that nice?

01:08:18.671 --> 01:08:21.296
This makes no sense.

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:25.551
No, you know?
It leads nowhere.

01:08:25.553 --> 01:08:29.749
It's just a detached door.
You can just through it.

01:08:29.849 --> 01:08:32.477
Maybe, maybe not.

01:08:32.478 --> 01:08:35.323
Sean
gone through every door in this building.

01:08:35.823 --> 01:08:40.162
Except this.
- This is our way out.

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:49.734
He's too fat.
- The bolt cutter cut therethrough.

01:08:54.196 --> 01:08:58.799
Got a bolt cutter?
- Yes...

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.420
we had a bag of tools,
but we are lost.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.399
Where is it, are you lost?

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.747
The building is huge.
It's big.

01:09:11.645 --> 01:09:14.883
It's as big as a city.
- It's bigger and bigger and bigger.

01:09:14.983 --> 01:09:17.028
It changes constantly.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.798
But there are patterns.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.393
I encountered them.

01:09:22.493 --> 01:09:24.294
Where did you get the bag left behind?

01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:29.970
I do not know, it was a hall
with all bathtubs in the rooms.

01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:40.126
4 hours, 6.
7, 8 pm.

01:09:40.227 --> 01:09:46.185
This is crazy, it is a detached door.
That door leads nowhere.

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:50.783
Alex, this is not Narnia.
- No, sorry but this is crazy. It's stupid.

01:09:50.884 --> 01:09:52.760
You know what else is weird?
a hotel through...

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:55.555
and end at the same place as
where you started.

01:09:55.655 --> 01:09:57.472
We have spared this field

01:09:57.572 --> 01:10:00.308
What's in there?
- That's where Dr. Friedkin's.

01:10:00.408 --> 01:10:01.643
mean Friedkin doctor?

01:10:01.743 --> 01:10:06.915
He was the head here.
I've read about him, he was occult.

01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:10.939
Rituals in the basement.
Experiments in the patients.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.534
Where do you get this from?

01:10:14.634 --> 01:10:16.326
That's where he went inside.

01:10:23.768 --> 01:10:27.665
She opened the door, you know?
Friedkin did.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:31.718
They took
the real world and the spiritual world...

01:10:31.818 --> 01:10:34.600
and he... added together.

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:42.048
Then he drew a hole in the building
and went inside. That door...

01:10:42.949 --> 01:10:46.229
is the only way.
You gotta believe me.

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:53.003
Alex, come on.

01:10:53.004 --> 01:10:56.595
I can not believe we're doing this,
why we follow him, Alex?

01:10:56.596 --> 01:11:00.688
Friend, I have a bad feeling about him.
- We have no choice, right?

01:11:05.733 --> 01:11:09.220
I thought you knew where you were going.
- Wait.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.731
.

01:11:11.531 --> 01:11:14.362
Come on, let's go.
We will not wait.

01:11:24.303 --> 01:11:26.043
Please delete it.

01:11:30.011 --> 01:11:31.812
See, I told you?

01:11:32.513 --> 01:11:34.278
Jesus Christ.

01:11:36.777 --> 01:11:41.118
What was that?
- Listen, come here.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:51.878
You know you drink water
a fucking toilet, right?

01:12:04.673 --> 01:12:08.771
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ.

01:12:12.222 --> 01:12:15.897
here, help me.
It should bring us to the other side.

01:12:31.411 --> 01:12:33.748
Are you okay, man?
- Trevor.

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:36.358
nothing beats
- okay?

01:12:36.458 --> 01:12:40.260
Trevor, the bag there?
- Yes, the bag is here.

01:12:47.554 --> 01:12:50.421
What is this now?
- Did you see me?

01:12:53.699 --> 01:12:55.499
Where is the bag? Got the bag?

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:02.760
This could work.
- Okay, but what do we do now?

01:13:04.861 --> 01:13:06.361
We rest for a few hours.

01:13:07.952 --> 01:13:09.655
And then I see what's behind the door.

01:13:10.455 --> 01:13:14.873
What are you doing?
- In case something happens to me...

01:14:38.696 --> 01:14:41.696
Fuck you, Alex.
Fuck, Jameson.

01:14:43.297 --> 01:14:45.097
Fool.

01:14:54.697 --> 01:14:58.034
Mom, Dad...

01:15:00.035 --> 01:15:03.648
Jason, if you look at this...

01:15:05.249 --> 01:15:08.335
means,
I'm probably dead.

01:15:09.336 --> 01:15:13.946
So I think, this is my last will and testament
.

01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:32.053
I would not be here, but I'm here.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:36.452
I'll fucking a will.

01:15:36.775 --> 01:15:40.643
I'm dying, I just wanna go home.

01:15:47.422 --> 01:15:51.382
Hello? Is there anyone?

01:15:59.434 --> 01:16:01.524
Hello?

01:16:05.098 --> 01:16:07.140
What the hell?

01:16:15.329 --> 01:16:17.869
Sean, you scared me, what do you want?

01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:38.829
I must do him.

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.302
I must do him.

01:17:14.393 --> 01:17:17.366
You've done that.

01:17:22.653 --> 01:17:24.271
We just woke up.

01:17:25.072 --> 01:17:28.004
And Trevor's death, we found him
in one of the bathrooms.

01:17:39.714 --> 01:17:42.804
I had to listen to Trevor,
I should trust him.

01:17:46.216 --> 01:17:51.377
Sean, took all our stuff. The bolt cutters,
water. What he left behind...

01:17:51.477 --> 01:17:55.063
had this fucking bag.

01:17:55.064 --> 01:17:57.884
We will never come out of this building,
we die here.

01:17:57.984 --> 01:18:02.113
Listen to me, calm down...
- Stop filming me.

01:18:02.114 --> 01:18:05.949
Stop filming me.
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:07.313
Listen to me...

01:18:07.514 --> 01:18:12.401
because I let anything happen.

01:18:12.702 --> 01:18:14.044
Okay?

01:18:14.544 --> 01:18:18.323
I let anything happen,
we come here, I promise you.

01:18:18.324 --> 01:18:23.009
Okay, now?
- I do not know.

01:18:31.449 --> 01:18:33.749
card, the card sucks.

01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:37.345
Can you read it?

01:18:38.446 --> 01:18:41.824
Can you read it?
- Yes, yes, I think so.

01:18:41.825 --> 01:18:44.213
Yes, we must go to the room with the door.
We need the bolt cutter...

01:18:44.313 --> 01:18:46.483
that's our only chance
to get out of here, okay?

01:18:53.045 --> 01:18:56.460
Are you sure it's that way?
They look at something.

01:18:57.737 --> 01:19:02.832
It is long since I was on camera.
Maybe I'm a little rusty.

01:19:02.932 --> 01:19:06.309
Maybe I'm a little rusty.

01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:11.242
I'm Lance Preston, welcome to a new
episode of "Grave Encounters".

01:19:12.443 --> 01:19:17.125
welcome to a new
episode of 'Grave...

01:19:18.699 --> 01:19:24.170
I'm Lance Preston, welcome to a new
episode of "Grave Encounters".

01:19:24.871 --> 01:19:28.401
The rest of the crew, is no longer with us.

01:19:28.501 --> 01:19:33.241
But I'm still here, if we're lucky, we might
make contact with them.

01:19:33.841 --> 01:19:38.172
Why did you close the door, Lance?
I want to go back to the hotel.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:42.600
I feel a dark and evil spirit, Lance.

01:19:42.601 --> 01:19:47.862
It may be a demon.
Who plays this character.

01:19:51.663 --> 01:19:55.163
I'm outta here. Which way is the room?
What is the correct door?

01:20:22.664 --> 01:20:24.264
Finally.

01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:37.987
Goddamn, what the hell
.

01:20:39.989 --> 01:20:42.584
No.

01:20:42.619 --> 01:20:45.553
Nonsense.
You broke your promise.

01:20:46.254 --> 01:20:50.945
Liar. All nonsense.
Liar.

01:20:55.473 --> 01:20:57.541
Give me the camera.

01:21:02.544 --> 01:21:05.698
You said only one of us who
red door could go.

01:21:05.925 --> 01:21:09.877
I've even killed
so they would not follow me.

01:21:09.947 --> 01:21:11.576
What did I do wrong?

01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:15.034
Answer.

01:21:15.035 --> 01:21:18.535
<i> Get the others. </ I></i>

01:21:20.043 --> 01:21:22.860
How do I do that?
If you do not let me go?

01:21:27.161 --> 01:21:29.361
<i> Collect the tapes. </ I></i>

01:21:29.638 --> 01:21:33.305
Collect the tapes...
you want me to collect the material.

01:21:33.975 --> 01:21:37.742
Yes, I do.
I can try.

01:21:44.204 --> 01:21:46.404
<i> Make the movie. </ I></i>

01:21:46.405 --> 01:21:48.391
What movie?

01:21:48.491 --> 01:21:52.236
What are you talking about?
Hello?

01:21:55.268 --> 01:21:59.104
Okay.
Collect the tapes.

01:22:00.305 --> 01:22:04.405
Collect the tapes.

01:22:06.006 --> 01:22:09.506
Collect the tapes.
I must collect the tapes.

01:22:16.689 --> 01:22:19.104
Are you sure we should go this way?

01:22:19.604 --> 01:22:21.663
According to the map is here.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:24.190
Jennifer?
- Here it is.

01:22:24.491 --> 01:22:30.006
Wait. Sean told us that we had to avoid
surgical department.

01:22:31.181 --> 01:22:34.081
I do not think we have any other choice.

01:22:43.051 --> 01:22:44.774
What are these things for?

01:22:47.204 --> 01:22:48.876
My god.

01:22:52.642 --> 01:22:55.052
Why did Dr. Friedkin this?
- Goddamn.

01:23:05.202 --> 01:23:08.298
Alex this is not good.
We gotta go, keep moving.

01:23:09.999 --> 01:23:11.860
Let's get outta here.

01:23:16.923 --> 01:23:18.482
Come on.

01:23:24.182 --> 01:23:26.729
Turn off the light.

01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:29.530
not talk, be quiet.

01:23:31.531 --> 01:23:33.431
Be still, be still, damn.

01:23:58.074 --> 01:24:01.713
Is that Doctor Friedkin?
- Do not, do not.

01:24:02.759 --> 01:24:04.932
Jennifer, be still.
Shut up.

01:24:47.933 --> 01:24:49.691
Is this a joke or something.

01:25:16.031 --> 01:25:20.314
in. Close the door.

01:25:23.239 --> 01:25:25.442
Okay, I think we're here.
- You said you could read.

01:25:25.477 --> 01:25:27.411
I do my best.
- Are you sure?

01:25:27.511 --> 01:25:29.875
I do not fucking.

01:25:32.876 --> 01:25:35.376
Damn, Jennifer, look.

01:25:36.245 --> 01:25:39.968
How did we get here.
- How do we get the hell out.

01:25:40.542 --> 01:25:43.267
It seems that he has already been
do you think he has gone through?

01:25:45.283 --> 01:25:47.283
Looks.

01:25:47.766 --> 01:25:50.321
We're too late.
- We're too late, he has escaped.

01:25:53.927 --> 01:25:58.561
Well, it does not work.
- You killed Trevor, stupid fool.

01:25:59.839 --> 01:26:05.359
Your friend was dead,
at the moment he entered the building.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.213
Those were all of you.

01:26:09.814 --> 01:26:12.014
Alex, look at this.

01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:18.617
He said that if one of us has all tires.
That he can go.

01:26:19.418 --> 01:26:21.142
And that would be me.

01:26:23.124 --> 01:26:25.672
Now you must stay behind.

01:26:28.763 --> 01:26:31.811
I've been here too long.

01:26:32.169 --> 01:26:38.078
Have you any idea what ten years here,
can do to a person?

01:26:40.441 --> 01:26:42.117
I just wanna go home.

01:26:44.914 --> 01:26:48.024
Well, give me the recording of your cameras.

01:26:48.525 --> 01:26:50.294
I need to finish the movie.

01:26:51.495 --> 01:26:53.381
I give you anything.

01:26:54.582 --> 01:26:56.435
This is my movie.

01:26:57.336 --> 01:27:00.739
The building says I
the movie must finish.

01:27:00.839 --> 01:27:03.103
Give me the damn pictures...

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.907
Give me the recordings.

01:27:21.112 --> 01:27:24.821
Let him go.
- That is only if he dies.

01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:30.812
building chose me and not you.

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.190
I need to finish the film.

01:27:38.881 --> 01:27:40.869
Are you okay? Is it?

01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:45.878
fucking bitch.

01:27:46.598 --> 01:27:48.196
I'll kill you.

01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:21.894
Hang.
- I can not.

01:28:26.352 --> 01:28:28.985
I did what you asked liar.

01:28:46.333 --> 01:28:47.943
Alex?

01:28:49.544 --> 01:28:51.532
Alex, are you?

01:28:54.333 --> 01:28:58.171
He's gone, he's
sucked.

01:28:59.672 --> 01:29:01.713
What do we do now?

01:29:12.196 --> 01:29:17.043
I try to finish the film.

01:29:17.074 --> 01:29:19.868
The film finish.

01:29:19.869 --> 01:29:23.302
This was all about.
Why they contacted me.

01:29:25.833 --> 01:29:27.870
The building wants an end.

01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:30.145
Alex, what are you talking about?

01:29:33.677 --> 01:29:38.651
I think I just
the end of my film have invented.

01:29:40.768 --> 01:29:43.130
You're the star.

01:29:46.817 --> 01:29:49.069
Alex, what are you doing?

01:29:49.777 --> 01:29:52.119
You heard him.

01:29:52.363 --> 01:29:56.270
One of us will come here.
So what do you think, Jennifer?

01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:59.336
You've always said you wanted...

01:29:59.436 --> 01:30:02.401
your last film was a hero story, right?

01:30:02.501 --> 01:30:05.797
This is the scene, do not make it harder than it needs to be
.

01:30:07.256 --> 01:30:10.364
Alex, please...

01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:15.668
I'm sorry.

01:30:19.102 --> 01:30:22.226
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:33.087
Alex. No.

01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:41.419
It's over.

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.811
Go to sleep.

01:30:50.973 --> 01:30:52.766
I did it.

01:30:53.616 --> 01:30:57.425
Make your movie.
Others will see it and come.

01:31:00.773 --> 01:31:02.788
I will not disappoint you.

01:32:15.691 --> 01:32:18.862
Sir, I have a 41 here on the A5.

01:32:21.363 --> 01:32:25.241
7823, we have a white man...

01:32:25.242 --> 01:32:26.652
with a bag, I call for the strengthening...

01:32:27.053 --> 01:32:30.086
Sir.

01:32:30.243 --> 01:32:34.383
No, not my camera.
I need him. I'm not going back...

01:32:34.672 --> 01:32:36.534
I got my camera.

01:32:38.069 --> 01:32:41.077
Where am I?

01:32:42.235 --> 01:32:45.511
In what city am I?
- You're in LA.

01:32:56.403 --> 01:33:00.266
Jerry, can you tell us how the
Grave Encounters 2 form received?

01:33:00.366 --> 01:33:05.997
Well sure, I was as surprised as anyone
when this guy came to my office...

01:33:06.097 --> 01:33:09.208
to say that he is the sequel to
Grave Encounters had made. I mean...

01:33:09.209 --> 01:33:13.279
I thought he was crazy, but Alex
here...

01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:17.368
a talented director and I think
has a bright future.

01:33:17.468 --> 01:33:22.416
This has everything. It has ghosts
send messages over the Internet.

01:33:22.516 --> 01:33:26.003
Young girls are murdered,
boys are sucked into the walls.

01:33:26.103 --> 01:33:29.750
.. it's incredible material.
Hope you enjoyed it.

01:33:30.851 --> 01:33:36.514
I want to be clear about something, I made
this error with the first film.

01:33:36.614 --> 01:33:39.042
Everything you've just seen
is counterfeit.

01:33:39.442 --> 01:33:43.128
Okay, every scene has improved
or manipulated.

01:33:44.129 --> 01:33:45.799
It's just a movie.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.564
Is there anything else you want to add
before we close?

01:33:50.564 --> 01:33:53.492
Look, whatever you do.
Do not go to that building looking.

01:33:53.592 --> 01:33:56.387
not seeking...
It's not worth it.

01:33:57.588 --> 01:33:59.286
There's nothing there.
