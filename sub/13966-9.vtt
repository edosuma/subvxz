00:38.789 --> 00:40.290
The Khan.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.560
Forget him.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.012
Brilliant.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.016
It's brilliant.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.061
Genghis.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.439
He never did it with horses.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.443
Do you think the Christians
had better luck finding the Latins?

01:50.527 --> 01:53.822
I don't care.
NiccolÃ² is their burden.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.282
We outnumber them two to one.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.034
The whites wanna fight us?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.119
They best hope
Jesus comes to their rescue.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.996
How did we get here?

02:02.956 --> 02:05.793
- Father?
- One bad choice after another.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.338
That's what got us here, isn't it?

02:16.011 --> 02:18.681
We face down what's in front of us.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.016
Win the Kurultai.
Avoid war.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.144
That's our mission.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.257
What in God's name is that?

03:02.725 --> 03:05.602
The Khan is here! Sound the alarm!

03:09.397 --> 03:11.817
Sound the goddamn alarm!

03:15.946 --> 03:17.030
The black powder!

03:18.782 --> 03:20.868
The black powder!

03:20.951 --> 03:22.410
Sound the alarm!

03:22.494 --> 03:24.579
Sound the alarm!

03:36.133 --> 03:37.550
Run! Run!

03:37.634 --> 03:39.803
Run! Get away from there! Run!

04:30.603 --> 04:32.981
We have to go. Hyah!

04:56.254 --> 04:57.505
Where's your father?

04:58.924 --> 05:01.426
He escaped back to his men.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.138
Good. Let him burn with them.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.272
A Mongol without a horse...

05:15.607 --> 05:17.985
is like a hawk without wings!

05:18.902 --> 05:23.740
The bodies of those mighty mares
may burn in the fire below.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.411
But their noble souls look down on each
and every one of you...

05:29.329 --> 05:31.664
from the Eternal Blue Sky above.

05:32.833 --> 05:37.504
They look down, and they demand
their sacrifice was not in vain.

05:39.047 --> 05:42.425
Ride down there and prove it!

05:44.677 --> 05:46.179
Attack! Hyah!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.441
NiccolÃ²! You've returned.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.110
By the grace of God.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.987
- What are your orders?
- We fight back.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.280
You must leave.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.531
What?

06:04.614 --> 06:06.658
Ride back to Karakorum.
Your betrayal has been uncovered.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.202
You must win at the Kurultai.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.412
It's the only way.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.747
It ends here.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.832
One rules, one dies.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.669
If you die, it's over.
Do you understand?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.047
We'll make
Genghis proud, Father.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.382
Go!

06:36.438 --> 06:37.897
Let's go.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.082
Jingim.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.292
Cousins.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.526
Stop dancing, Prince...

11:34.319 --> 11:35.528
and fight me!

13:05.159 --> 13:06.285
Attack!

13:09.497 --> 13:11.499
How does your Chinese god
look to you now?

14:33.122 --> 14:34.123
Go!

14:34.206 --> 14:35.625
This is over!

14:35.708 --> 14:38.545
You don't have to die tonight.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.006
Come with me.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.426
Come home.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.504
Kaidu?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.383
We're searching.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.470
And Nayan?

16:22.899 --> 16:24.484
I had to make a choice.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.239
I chose my faith.

16:33.284 --> 16:37.121
What god asks you to choose
between himself and your blood?

16:38.956 --> 16:41.918
Then asks you to turn my son against me?

16:43.961 --> 16:45.046
Your son?

16:47.048 --> 16:48.215
Ahmad.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.344
You don't know?

16:56.182 --> 16:59.060
It was not I who recruited Kaidu,

16:59.143 --> 17:01.478
nor was it Kaidu who came to see me.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.651
It was Ahmad that brought us together.

17:07.902 --> 17:10.362
Who brought all of this together.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.324
Your Vice Regent.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.868
Your son... as you call him.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.713
- I am...
- Dead.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.428
As it should be.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.727
You were given choice in life.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.733
I give you the honor to choose
how you wish to leave it.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.683
Take a regiment.
Lead them.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.519
Find Ahmad.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.647
Whatever it takes, just bring him to me.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.775
- It is done, my Khan.
- Mmm.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.862
Thank you, my son.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.208
Kublai, the baby is coming.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.753
- The baby comes now?
- Early.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.213
Two moons early.

22:20.797 --> 22:23.175
So, even this may end terribly.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.849
You are a man of many faces, Kublai.

22:30.933 --> 22:34.686
But to mope and moon with self-pity
is not the Kublai I know.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.854
Or wish to.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.357
Forgive me for not knowing
the proper remedy.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.277
My first sampling of betrayal by a son.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.238
Try this for remedy.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.324
Tend to your other son.

22:47.408 --> 22:50.077
The one on the brink
of fatherhood himself.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.706
Wash up, get dressed.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.418
Pretend if you must...

22:57.960 --> 23:03.340
but go to Jingim, and show him you still
care about the future of this family.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.190
No! No!

23:21.775 --> 23:23.235
What is it, my child?

23:24.153 --> 23:26.488
She refuses the calming herbs.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.449
- Her heart beat is rapid?
- Very rapid.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.534
Don't speak of me
as though I'm not here...

23:30.617 --> 23:32.328
or don't exist.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.872
She's fighting her instincts,
and hurting the child.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.249
I am not!

23:38.750 --> 23:40.377
Stop.

23:40.461 --> 23:41.878
Stop fighting.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.841
Breathe. Breathe.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.469
In and out.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.012
There you go.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.310
It's too early, Mother.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.478
It's too early.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.480
This is how babies are born.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.607
Early or not, it is time.

24:01.690 --> 24:02.733
No.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.319
- It's too soon.
- Look at me.

24:06.237 --> 24:07.321
I'm here.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.824
Just listen to me one last time.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.035
Yes?

24:22.378 --> 24:23.795
What did she say?

24:28.384 --> 24:29.885
Tell me what to do.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.265
You are going to have to start to push.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.650
You were an impatient child.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.985
Why should your offspring
be any different?

24:47.069 --> 24:48.570
Do you remember on my wedding night

24:48.654 --> 24:51.573
when you said you hadn't
any secrets to share on marriage?

24:51.657 --> 24:53.700
Was this before or after the wine?

24:53.784 --> 24:56.745
Remarkably, you seem to have
even less to offer on childbirth.

24:58.372 --> 24:59.540
May I?

25:00.832 --> 25:02.043
Of course.

25:03.544 --> 25:06.755
My feelings have never
swung so wildly before.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.132
Not even in battle.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.217
I've heard some call that fatherhood.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.928
The Khan?

25:17.015 --> 25:18.059
In seclusion?

25:18.600 --> 25:19.768
Still.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.729
We can't blame him.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.690
He won the battle at the cost of a son.

25:24.773 --> 25:28.360
And the Khan's impatience for gain
is rivaled only by his sluggishness

25:28.444 --> 25:29.736
with which he handles loss.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.199
Well, his heir is coming.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.616
With or without him.

25:57.473 --> 25:58.932
I take all comers.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.895
Push.
No.

26:15.031 --> 26:17.826
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

26:17.909 --> 26:19.495
We know, child.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.956
Be prepared to push again.

26:23.039 --> 26:25.334
Good girl.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.504
In and out... in and out.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.965
And now push!

26:32.924 --> 26:34.593
It doesn't feel right.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.928
- Push.
- Now, push!

26:41.392 --> 26:43.185
You're very close.

26:43.935 --> 26:46.188
Something feels wrong.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.149
I know. I remember this.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.151
- You do?
- Yes.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.486
The hardest part is at the end.

26:52.569 --> 26:56.240
You must relax, take deep breaths,

26:56.323 --> 26:58.242
and make it easy for the baby.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.828
All right.

27:01.912 --> 27:05.874
When you feel the pain again,
you must push.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.879
I feel it! I feel it, I feel it.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.339
Again, push!

27:17.886 --> 27:19.012
I see the head!

27:29.898 --> 27:31.400
Next.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.653
Preferably someone that can see...

27:37.698 --> 27:39.157
and isn't Latin.

27:55.632 --> 27:56.675
You nervous?

28:01.597 --> 28:03.807
- Very.
- You should be.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.518
Fatherhood is nothing to take lightly.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.482
And yet there are few joys in life

28:11.565 --> 28:16.111
as complete as the welcoming
of your first child.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.448
Even a girl.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.495
Of course, if it is a boy...

28:25.954 --> 28:27.456
life is far more blessed.

28:28.582 --> 28:31.710
The future secured, everyone happy.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.048
But, son or daughter...

28:38.800 --> 28:41.011
that baby is born of you.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.139
Your seed, your blood,

28:44.223 --> 28:45.807
your heart.

28:48.519 --> 28:49.770
Thank you, Father.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.731
Your words give me strength.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.108
Kaidu understands this.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.237
Love of one's child is sacred.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.698
Kaidu understands many things.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.412
The world gets bigger...

29:07.413 --> 29:09.456
you open your arms wider.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.584
Is that not the Genghis way?

29:14.461 --> 29:18.424
You let in the outsiders,
with their sad eyes and wounded hearts.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.676
The orphaned, the abandoned.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.886
Let them in your home.

29:22.969 --> 29:24.930
Learn from them, yes...

29:25.013 --> 29:26.348
but raise and love them.

29:27.599 --> 29:31.353
Offer them all the magic
the whole world has to offer.

29:33.564 --> 29:34.690
Then they fuck you.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.111
Oaths? Meaningless.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.239
Love in their eyes, worthless.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.158
Heart they promise you...

29:45.701 --> 29:46.993
will never be.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.665
You did it.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.627
What is it?

29:56.462 --> 29:57.713
You did it.

29:59.423 --> 30:00.632
Is it a boy?

30:02.133 --> 30:03.677
It's a healthy girl.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.979
She's healthy.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.439
That matters.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.165
What is it?

30:34.249 --> 30:37.043
It hurts. It hurts!

30:40.213 --> 30:41.382
There is another.

30:41.882 --> 30:44.843
- Another?
- Yes. It comes now!

30:49.222 --> 30:51.016
Don't let it out!

30:51.683 --> 30:56.355
Girl or boy, once it's out,
you're finished.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.487
Marco.

31:08.074 --> 31:09.325
I want Marco.

31:10.494 --> 31:13.497
Oh, they'll stare, plead...

31:13.580 --> 31:16.375
Love mixed with awe,
and mixed with coquetry,

31:16.458 --> 31:19.961
and mixed with an insatiable,
festering need.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.589
Need of a home, need of a father,

31:22.673 --> 31:24.841
need of a fucking place in the world.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.678
Give them all of this, then more,
and then what do they do?

31:28.261 --> 31:30.597
They scurry back to
their dubious relations,

31:30.681 --> 31:32.766
despite their meager characters

31:32.849 --> 31:34.476
that lack entirely of heart.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.144
- Father?
- Great Khan...

31:36.227 --> 31:37.688
Blood protects blood.

31:37.771 --> 31:40.482
To the detriment of the very oath
they've sworn to.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.443
- May we speak, sire?
- Kaidu knows.

31:42.526 --> 31:43.527
Knows what?

31:43.610 --> 31:47.448
The worthiest of strangers can be
nothing more but eventual deceptors,

31:47.531 --> 31:50.283
betrayers, and ultimately, traitors.

31:55.581 --> 31:56.623
What news?

31:57.624 --> 31:59.125
A healthy girl.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.338
And Kokachin?

32:04.089 --> 32:06.508
She is well, but another comes.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.301
- Another?
- Is it a boy?

32:08.885 --> 32:10.220
I must go back.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.222
Master Polo...

32:13.557 --> 32:14.933
a word?

32:15.517 --> 32:17.102
You have word for him and not for me?

32:17.185 --> 32:19.145
I just gave you word.

32:19.229 --> 32:20.897
Celebrate your daughter.

32:20.981 --> 32:24.192
Do not concern yourself
with insignificant things.

32:33.535 --> 32:36.872
Perhaps she needed help
setting water to boil.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.332
Get out.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.460
Joyfully.

32:55.516 --> 32:57.726
Is there something to which
I am not aware?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.270
Obviously.

33:03.524 --> 33:05.358
No!

33:05.441 --> 33:07.068
No!

33:09.821 --> 33:11.948
- Push!
- No!

33:12.032 --> 33:13.659
No!

33:34.262 --> 33:37.516
You must promise me something.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.059
Anything.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.188
You must always come when I call.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.441
Of course. Of course.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.651
Always.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.573
Not only for me... but for them as well.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.036
I will, yes.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.871
I promise.

33:59.955 --> 34:03.625
Promise me, NergÃ¼i.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.086
I promise you, NergÃ¼i.

34:08.839 --> 34:11.757
Your word is all I have.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.887
It's all you ever need.

34:26.690 --> 34:27.774
It doesn't matter.

34:27.858 --> 34:30.068
- It doesn't matter?
- No.

34:30.150 --> 34:32.152
- I feel like a fool.
- You're no fool.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.781
The Latin is with my wife
as she births my child.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.951
It doesn't matter.
You're son to the Khan.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.328
No round-eyed Latin
is gonna make you a fool.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.748
We'll deal with him
when the time is right.

34:55.301 --> 34:57.846
Good.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.139
Good. You're doing good.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.814
Keep pushing, my daughter.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.253
Father. Brother.

35:31.212 --> 35:33.924
- Ahmad's in Cambulac.
- He hides in plain sight?

35:34.007 --> 35:35.508
In a way.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.428
And why doesn't his scalp
hang from your belt?

35:39.304 --> 35:40.931
Because he's seized the city in your name.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.688
<i>Thousands are gathered,</i>
<i>stuck on the outskirts.</i>

35:48.604 --> 35:50.565
<i>No one allowed in, no one allowed out.</i>

35:51.482 --> 35:52.984
<i>He has sealed the walls.</i>

35:54.027 --> 35:55.987
<i>- A coup.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

35:56.071 --> 35:58.573
<i>The army believes they act
on the Khan's orders.</i>

35:58.657 --> 36:01.034
<i>Ahmad's convinced them
you gave him the authority.</i>

36:01.117 --> 36:04.037
I gave him all the authority.
He's my Vice Regent.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.789
He controls the army.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.917
And he's cut all lines of communication.
There's nothing to contradict his orders.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.126
Except me.

36:11.502 --> 36:14.589
I'll leave. Show myself,
order them to stand down.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.091
The Kurultai...

36:16.174 --> 36:19.094
Fuck the Kurultai!
Ahmad's stolen my throne, my city...

36:19.177 --> 36:22.430
Kaidu only needs one vote to win
in your absence.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.099
What if that's his plan?

36:24.182 --> 36:27.560
Draw you away from your chieftains,
defeat you fairly by the laws of the land.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.106
Ahmad has defied you.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.692
He has committed the most
heinous acts of treason, yes.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.111
But he has not stolen your throne.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.821
You are still the Khan of Khans.

36:40.115 --> 36:43.368
I'll go. I will defeat him in your name.

36:44.619 --> 36:48.164
<i>I will show your people that
the Vice Regent is not your son</i>

36:48.248 --> 36:49.582
<i>and never was.</i>

36:49.665 --> 36:52.293
<i>That he was never made of what you are.</i>

36:52.377 --> 36:53.461
<i>But I am.</i>

36:54.254 --> 36:56.047
<i>Your eyes are my eyes.</i>

36:56.131 --> 36:57.716
<i>Your hands are my hands.</i>

36:57.799 --> 37:00.135
<i>I speak the truth with your voice.</i>

37:00.676 --> 37:02.595
<i>I will rally the army.</i>

37:02.678 --> 37:04.264
<i>I will pacify the people.</i>

37:04.347 --> 37:06.224
<i>And they will know,
as will the chieftains,</i>

37:06.307 --> 37:08.351
<i>that this House of Tolui,</i>

37:08.434 --> 37:11.772
this bloodline, is strong and worthy.

37:15.608 --> 37:18.194
A boy. Healthy baby boy.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.282
A boy.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.535
We have a boy.

37:26.202 --> 37:28.079
You did it.

38:26.762 --> 38:28.431
You will go with Jingim.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.599
Yes, sire.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.059
Take back the throne.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.311
Take back the city.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.355
Find Ahmad,

38:35.438 --> 38:37.899
rip his heart out from his body,
and bring it to me.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.261
Until she is ready.

39:27.949 --> 39:29.200
Marco.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.662
He is perfect.

39:34.622 --> 39:35.831
He's not.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.585
The baby's not Jingim's.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.065
I want to see my children.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.596
A boy and a girl.

40:33.639 --> 40:34.765
What a gift.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.352
I am so proud of you.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.068
Do you not wish to hold him?

40:46.027 --> 40:48.446
She's much weakened by the labor.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.117
Perhaps it is time for your father
to meet his heir.

41:13.679 --> 41:15.181
I knew you would come.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.602
I knew... always.

41:27.360 --> 41:30.030
We meet the Kurultai
with a true symbol of hope.

41:36.702 --> 41:38.204
Now you must go, my son.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.706
What is this?

41:40.790 --> 41:41.957
Ahmad.

41:42.792 --> 41:43.959
Has been found?

41:44.460 --> 41:45.503
Father.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.425
Your service is complete.

41:52.093 --> 41:53.511
Your service is complete.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.221
Blood only.
