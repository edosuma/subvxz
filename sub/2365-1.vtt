01:12.480 --> 01:14.005
Mum!

01:29.800 --> 01:31.199
Mum!

01:34.080 --> 01:35.491
Mummy!

01:38.520 --> 01:40.010
Mum!

01:41.920 --> 01:43.365
Mum!

01:44.520 --> 01:46.488
I had the dream again.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.802
"And he climbed down
that chimney,

01:57.803 --> 02:01.079
"straight into
the huge black pot.

02:01.080 --> 02:05.165
"And that was the end of
the big, bad wolf."

02:08.759 --> 02:11.047
Did they really kill the wolf,
Mum?

02:11.048 --> 02:13.519
I'm sure they did.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.921
I'll kill the monster
when it comes.

02:15.922 --> 02:18.002
I'll smash its head in.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.243
It's time to go to sleep now,
sweetie.

02:22.244 --> 02:23.719
It's very late.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.530
Can we read it again?

02:29.520 --> 02:32.999
"A long time ago -
just yesterday, in fact-

02:33.000 --> 02:37.847
"there were three little pigs
and one nasty big wolf."

03:47.000 --> 03:48.123
What have you done?

03:48.124 --> 03:49.882
It's not broken.
It just slipped.

03:49.883 --> 03:52.164
I don't want you firing
things off in the house anymore.

03:52.165 --> 03:55.209
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the
monster comes, I'm gonna do this.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.361
Please don't!

03:59.880 --> 04:01.206
Nothing in my hands.

04:01.207 --> 04:03.726
- Nothing in my hands.
- Stand still, please.

04:03.727 --> 04:05.239
Look at me, Mum!

04:05.240 --> 04:06.439
Come on, Samuel.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.681
- Look at me.
- Stand still, please.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.519
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.045
I don't want you
making weapons anymore.

04:12.046 --> 04:13.963
It doesn't work
if you don't look at me.

04:13.964 --> 04:17.043
This monster thing
has got to stop, alright?

04:25.760 --> 04:26.886
Mmm.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.162
Don't do that!

04:34.760 --> 04:36.171
Ready?

04:38.320 --> 04:39.890
Come on.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.765
Quick. You're late already.

04:45.766 --> 04:47.485
What have you got in there?

04:47.486 --> 04:48.925
See you later, alligator.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.601
Here's one for you, Norma.
It's got milk in it.

05:00.602 --> 05:01.719
What?

05:01.720 --> 05:03.599
One with your milk in it.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.399
I don't want milk.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.165
No worries.
I'll make you another one.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.531
Ah, just where a woman
should be. In the kitchen.

05:14.532 --> 05:16.839
Hmm. Get to work, woman.

05:17.683 --> 05:18.806
Do you want a cuppa?

05:18.807 --> 05:21.719
Nah. I'm heading for
the dementia ward.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.759
Aw.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.760
It's a few years before
you end up there, isn't it?

05:25.603 --> 05:27.250
Right?

05:31.920 --> 05:32.728
Amelia?

05:32.729 --> 05:34.404
Your son's school
is on the phone.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.759
Oh, my God.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.119
Did he hurt anyone?

05:42.120 --> 05:44.441
A dart could have gone into
a child's eye or even worse.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.442
I'm going to have a serious talk
with him.

05:47.443 --> 05:49.679
Mrs Fanning,
we've had the talks.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.330
We've had the sessions
with the counsellor.

05:51.331 --> 05:55.319
We're going to have to employ
a monitor for him.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.559
Monitor?

05:56.560 --> 05:58.445
He'll be separated
from the other children.

05:58.446 --> 06:01.166
The monitor will supervise him
one-on-one.

06:01.167 --> 06:02.486
Samuel won't cope with this.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.886
He already feels so different.

06:03.887 --> 06:06.645
I'll have a talk with him.
I'll have a serious talk...

06:06.646 --> 06:07.719
Mrs Fanning,

06:07.720 --> 06:10.087
the boy has significant
behavioural problems.

06:10.088 --> 06:13.799
You know, Samuel doesn't need
a full-time monitor.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.961
What he needs
is some understanding.

06:15.962 --> 06:18.559
I have 24 other
first graders in that class.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.961
Do you want me to put them
all at risk because of your son?

06:20.962 --> 06:22.525
I think I'll just find
another school.

06:22.526 --> 06:24.919
Mrs Fanning, you can't just
take the boy out of school.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.888
You look after your business
and I'll go and find a school

06:26.889 --> 06:28.599
that sees my son
as a human being

06:28.600 --> 06:30.523
and not just as another problem
to be gotten rid of.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.410
That is very unfair. We're only
trying to help the boy.

06:33.411 --> 06:35.759
Please stop calling him
'the boy'.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.888
His name is Samuel.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.605
We can see Ruby and
Aunty Claire at the park today.

06:47.606 --> 06:49.681
You can play
on that swing you like

06:49.682 --> 06:51.523
for <i>as</i> long as you like, OK?

06:51.524 --> 06:54.439
Mrs Bruen hates me.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.010
No, she doesn't.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.329
Just need a break, that's all.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.448
Don't tell Aunty Claire
what happened.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.519
I'll tell her later.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.449
- Mum, come and look at this!
- I can do it again.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.805
Sam, don't bother the lady.

07:15.806 --> 07:17.359
No, no, no. That's alright.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.169
We have to go home and
see Daddy, though, haven't we?

07:19.170 --> 07:20.730
My dad's in the cemetery.

07:20.731 --> 07:21.879
Oh. That's...

07:21.880 --> 07:24.770
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

07:24.771 --> 07:27.359
Samuel.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.725
I'm sorry. He just...

07:28.726 --> 07:31.479
No, that's alright.
I shouldn't have...

07:31.480 --> 07:34.484
Well, your mum is very lucky
to have you, then, isn't she?

07:34.485 --> 07:36.199
We have to go.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.328
- Say, "See you later," Katie.
- Bye.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.282
The artist was so drunk,
he vomited.

07:41.283 --> 07:42.884
Right in front of
his own installation.

07:42.885 --> 07:44.799
Lost all these sales.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.759
You're not listening.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.439
I am. I am.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.442
So you lost all these sales
and then what happened?

07:51.443 --> 07:53.363
Ruby! Don't play there.
It's wet.

07:53.364 --> 07:55.839
Mum! Mum!

07:55.840 --> 07:58.571
I'm gonna <i>smash</i> its head!

08:00.880 --> 08:03.690
- Be careful.
- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.807
What would you like me
to do for Wednesday?

08:08.808 --> 08:11.849
I can get their birthday cakes.
That's easy.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.967
I was hoping Ruby
would change her mind.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.926
She doesn't want a joint party
with Sam this year.

08:19.927 --> 08:23.079
- Oh.
- Mum! Mum!

08:23.080 --> 08:24.605
She wants to have
a princess party.

08:24.606 --> 08:26.759
Mum! Mum!

08:26.760 --> 08:28.199
That's OK.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.359
We don't have to come.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.239
You can still come.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.318
Mum!

08:33.320 --> 08:35.448
She just doesn't want to share
the day with Sam anymore.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.442
- I understand. I understand.
- Mum!

08:37.443 --> 08:40.649
Mum, I can go really high!
Watch.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.523
Maybe you want to celebrate
his birthday properly

08:45.524 --> 08:46.759
this year, anyway.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.999
- On the day.
- Yeah, we'll see.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.599
You know, Amelia,
I just want you to be happy

08:52.600 --> 08:54.522
and then this birthday thing
rolls around

08:54.523 --> 08:55.679
and I end up feeling awful.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.200
I don't want you to feel awful,
Claire.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.999
We'll be fine.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.126
We'll be absolutely fine.

09:01.127 --> 09:02.804
Mum! Look at me!

09:08.040 --> 09:09.804
Mama!

09:14.920 --> 09:17.839
- Who do we have here?
- Hello, Mrs Roach.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.759
You look tired, little one.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.999
Have you been in the wars today?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.359
A few wars.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.919
He's had a big day, that's all.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.479
He's just exhausted.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.239
Poor little sweetheart.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.599
Bugsy-

09:30.600 --> 09:32.284
Come here, little girl. Hello.

09:32.285 --> 09:34.799
You look tired too, love.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.159
You OK?

09:36.160 --> 09:38.279
Nothing five years of sleep
wouldn't fix.

09:39.248 --> 09:41.083
I'll put your rubbish out
for you, Grace.

09:41.084 --> 09:43.719
No, no, no.
You've just got in, pet.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.245
I'll do it now. Then it's done.

10:23.760 --> 10:25.524
You can choose one tonight.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.690
Where did you get this?

10:33.691 --> 10:35.125
On the shelf.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.125
"if it's in a word
or it's in a look,

10:44.126 --> 10:46.805
"you can't get rid of
the Babadook.

10:49.560 --> 10:53.004
"If you're a really clever one
and you know what it is to see,

10:53.005 --> 10:55.885
"then you can make friends
with a special one -

10:55.886 --> 10:57.370
"a friend of you and me."

11:02.000 --> 11:06.839
"His name is Mister Babadook
and this is his book.

11:06.840 --> 11:11.359
"A rumbling sound,
then three sharp knocks -

11:11.360 --> 11:14.759
"ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!

11:14.760 --> 11:17.679
"That's when you'll know
he's around.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.921
"You'll see him if you look.

11:22.520 --> 11:26.279
"Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"

11:26.280 --> 11:28.165
We might read another one
tonight, hey?

11:28.166 --> 11:29.969
But you said I could choose.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.959
"This is what he wears on top.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.042
"He's funny, don't you think?

11:42.080 --> 11:44.162
"See him
in your room at night..."

11:46.280 --> 11:48.203
Mum? Does it hurt the boy?

11:50.280 --> 11:51.479
Mum?

11:51.480 --> 11:54.165
Does it live under the bed? Mum?

11:55.640 --> 11:57.130
Mummy?

11:59.120 --> 12:00.679
Mummy?!

12:01.880 --> 12:02.924
"How sweetly they sung,

12:02.925 --> 12:04.602
"telling of the happiness
and loveliness

12:04.603 --> 12:06.681
"that lay at the bottom of
the ocean

12:06.682 --> 12:09.126
and entreating the sirens
not to be afraid."

13:15.680 --> 13:18.519
It's that time of
night again.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.169
Time...

13:19.170 --> 13:21.524
if that's what
the doctor ordered, I...

13:21.525 --> 13:23.807
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That's what the doctor ordered.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.685
Do you...

15:00.400 --> 15:01.599
Mum!

15:01.600 --> 15:03.362
- It's in my room!
- What is?

15:03.363 --> 15:05.089
- The Babadook!
- Oh, no.

15:05.090 --> 15:09.599
No, no, no.
This is not going to happen.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.251
The closet doors were closed
and now they're wide open.

15:12.252 --> 15:14.159
It's just a book.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.439
It can't hurt you.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.079
You've had a big day.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.606
You're just exhausted.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.168
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, Mum.

15:28.280 --> 15:31.639
Nothing bad's going to happen,
Sam.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.086
I'm gonna protect you.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.931
Mum, it's 9:00.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.608
He's not running a fever
anymore.

16:56.609 --> 17:00.799
No, no, no. My sister's gonna
take him. Put it back!

17:00.800 --> 17:02.564
Put it back
or it goes in the bin.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.679
Sorry. What was that?

17:05.680 --> 17:09.080
Oh, no. I couldn't get to
the phone. He was vomiting.

17:09.082 --> 17:11.845
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries. I'll see you soon.

17:11.846 --> 17:15.083
Samuel, no monster talk
at Aunty Claire's, OK?

17:16.240 --> 17:20.131
Samuel - no Babadook.
No nothing. Alright?

17:27.560 --> 17:30.079
88. Number 88.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.919
Two fat ladies.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.479
Good, Elaine!

17:33.480 --> 17:36.006
Another few days and someone
could call out, "Bingo!"

17:39.360 --> 17:40.639
Number 11.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.319
Who has number 11?

17:42.320 --> 17:44.319
Legs 11.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.051
Hey? See what else we've got.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.199
5 billion.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.521
Anyone got 5 billion?

18:04.160 --> 18:06.811
Beverley's not very impressed
with your bingo skills.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.279
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.931
No, I'm fine. How are you?
How's D wing?

18:14.932 --> 18:18.003
Fine. Yeah.
Just a bunch of old people.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.279
You don't have to be fine,
you know.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.559
Just a bit stressed
at the moment.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.324
Why don't you go home?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.719
Old cranky bitch -
she goes after lunch.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.607
I can cover for you.

18:33.608 --> 18:36.126
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.679
I'll give you my Pay-

18:39.680 --> 18:41.523
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

18:41.524 --> 18:43.719
You've got a sick boy.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.519
Life's too short.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.279
You're so sweet, Robbie.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.679
- You should go.
- Yeah.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.763
- Say hi to Sam for me.
- I will.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.721
Where have you been?
You weren't at work.

19:46.722 --> 19:47.919
Rung you a million times.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.919
What happened?

19:48.920 --> 19:50.921
Just scared the crap
out of Ruby. That's all.

19:50.922 --> 19:53.965
He insisted on talking to this
bloody Babadook thing all day.

19:53.966 --> 19:56.121
Just talking to the air -
even freaked me out.

19:56.122 --> 19:57.119
I'm so sorry.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.531
You need to get him
to see someone, Amelia.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.363
It's not normal for a kid
to carry on with this rubbish.

20:00.364 --> 20:01.766
It's not rubbish. It's real!

20:01.767 --> 20:03.808
Don't you talk to
your Aunty Claire like that.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.045
Where did you get
those firecrackers?

20:08.046 --> 20:09.879
You got them for me
on the internet.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.320
Well,
that's the end of the internet.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.245
If the Babadook was real, we'd
see it right now, wouldn't we?

20:16.246 --> 20:19.719
It wants to scare you first
then you'll see it.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.479
Well, I'm not scared.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.484
You will be when it creeps
into your room at night.

20:24.485 --> 20:26.079
That's enough.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.559
You will be
when it eats your insides.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.366
I've decided

20:29.367 --> 20:31.169
you're not having your birthday
with Ruby this week.

20:31.170 --> 20:32.810
No cake, no games.
That's the end of it.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.759
Samuel.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.719
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mum and Dad,

20:51.720 --> 20:54.279
life is not always as it seems.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.399
It can be a wondrous thing.

20:57.400 --> 21:01.644
But it can also be
very treacherous.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.559
Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.450
I'm gonna trap
the Babadook like this.

21:18.240 --> 21:21.319
And when it's trapped,
I'm gonna kill it.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.322
Samuel.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.079
I was just
putting something back.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.443
All your father's things
are down there.

21:35.444 --> 21:36.441
He's my father.

21:36.442 --> 21:38.488
You don't own him!

21:40.120 --> 21:42.282
Just thought I'd see
how you're going.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.886
Can I come in?

21:48.160 --> 21:51.159
Hey, matey. This is for you.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.845
My mum always got me a model
plane when I was sick.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.285
I'm not sick.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.079
Oh. I-l thought...

21:59.080 --> 22:00.679
No, he's not, actually.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.639
The truth is he's so disobedient
he can't go to school anymore.

22:03.640 --> 22:04.639
You said that's not true.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.130
How many 6-year-old boys
do you know, Robbie,

22:06.120 --> 22:07.246
who still believe in monsters?

22:07.247 --> 22:08.359
I hate you!

22:08.360 --> 22:09.850
She won't let me have
a birthday party

22:09.851 --> 22:12.764
and she won't let me have a dad!

23:17.080 --> 23:18.764
Ohh.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.566
Don't eat it.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.883
The Babadook did it, Mum.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.005
Go and watch a DVD
and I'll make something else.

23:42.006 --> 23:43.479
The Babadook did it!

23:43.480 --> 23:45.209
Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.

23:45.210 --> 23:47.759
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:47.760 --> 23:49.759
girls and boys,

23:49.760 --> 23:54.999
welcome to the great Martin's
DVD 'School of Magic'.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.959
Life is not always as it seems.

23:57.960 --> 24:01.919
It can be a wondrous thing.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.799
But it can also be
very treacherous.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.039
In this DVD,

24:08.040 --> 24:12.479
you will learn magic tricks
to surprise, to delight

24:12.480 --> 24:17.884
and perhaps even shock
your family and friends.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.004
Do you think this is funny?

24:43.320 --> 24:46.130
Oh, no. No. No!

24:48.080 --> 24:49.679
Give it to me!

24:51.160 --> 24:53.731
Do you wanna die?

26:03.240 --> 26:05.719
Don't let it in!
Don't let it in!

26:05.720 --> 26:09.279
Don't let it in! Don't
let it in! Don't let it in!

26:09.280 --> 26:11.009
Don't let it in!

27:18.960 --> 27:22.248
Mum, do we have to
go to Ruby's party?

27:32.200 --> 27:34.639
I've already got this doll, Mum.

27:34.640 --> 27:35.919
Now she's got a twin.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.120
They can go shopping together.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.039
Off you go.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.319
He's just really tired.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.361
Go and play right now.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.159
Claire tells me you're a writer.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.759
Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.159
What kind of writing did you do?

28:07.160 --> 28:10.959
I wrote some articles for some
magazines, did some kids' stuff.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.281
You just need to get
back into it. That's all.

28:13.282 --> 28:14.686
It must be difficult.

28:14.687 --> 28:18.001
I do volunteer work
with some disadvantaged women

28:18.002 --> 28:20.651
and a few of them
have lost their husbands

28:20.652 --> 28:23.211
and they find it very hard.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.604
How's Richard's merger going?

28:26.605 --> 28:30.679
Oh, good. I mean,
his workload's just ballooned.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.359
I've got the kids 24/7,
it feels like.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.479
Tell me about it!

28:34.480 --> 28:36.721
I don't even have time to go to the gym
anymore. It's ridiculous!

28:36.722 --> 28:38.279
That's a real tragedy.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.485
Not having time to go to the gym
anymore. How do you cope?

28:41.486 --> 28:43.481
You must have so much
to talk about

28:43.482 --> 28:45.084
with those poor
disadvantaged women.

28:56.040 --> 28:59.599
This is my tree house.
You're not allowed in here.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.011
I'm not hurting anybody.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.204
Bye.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.048
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.649
How would your mum know
if it's real or not?

29:16.650 --> 29:18.599
She never comes to our house.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.001
Mum told Dad she didn't want
to go to your house

29:21.002 --> 29:22.805
'cause it's too depressing.

29:22.806 --> 29:25.690
The Babadook would eat your mum
for breakfast.

29:25.691 --> 29:28.119
- It'd rip her arms off.
- Shut up!

29:28.120 --> 29:31.199
They feel sorry for me, Claire.
There's a big difference.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.521
God, Amelia, as soon as anyone
mentions Oskar, you can't cope.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.999
- That's not true.
- It'll be seven years.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.411
Isn't it time you moved on?

29:37.412 --> 29:38.879
I have moved on.

29:38.880 --> 29:42.199
I don't mention him.
I don't talk about him.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.244
What strain is that on you,
Claire?

29:44.245 --> 29:46.923
You're not even
good enough to have a dad.

29:46.924 --> 29:48.888
Everyone else has one
and you don't.

29:48.889 --> 29:50.479
I do have a dad!

29:50.480 --> 29:53.239
I listen to your life
day in, day out,

29:53.240 --> 29:56.210
and you never stop to ask me
anything about mine.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.399
I do!

29:57.400 --> 29:59.039
I want to know how you are.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.690
You don't come round
to our house anymore.

30:00.691 --> 30:02.808
Because I can't stand
being around your son.

30:02.809 --> 30:05.319
I can't believe
you just said that.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.763
You can't stand being around him
yourself.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.161
Your dad died so he didn't
have to be with you.

30:10.162 --> 30:11.599
That's not true!

30:11.600 --> 30:12.761
And your mum doesn't want you.

30:12.762 --> 30:15.001
No-one wants you.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.799
What did you do?!

30:26.800 --> 30:29.371
She said I didn't have a dad.
She kept saying it.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.479
Is she alright?

30:32.480 --> 30:35.003
Stay here
and look after the children

30:35.004 --> 30:37.002
or do you want another one
to get hurt?

30:37.003 --> 30:41.879
Mummy!
She wouldn't believe me!

30:41.880 --> 30:44.279
Mummy! Mummy!

30:44.280 --> 30:46.119
Mummy!

30:46.120 --> 30:49.959
- Mummy! Mummy!
- Why can't you just be normal?!

30:51.480 --> 30:53.679
There is no Babadook!

30:55.360 --> 30:57.522
Get out!

31:00.080 --> 31:02.639
- Get out!
- Samuel?

31:02.640 --> 31:04.799
- Mummy!
- Stop this now!

31:04.800 --> 31:07.559
Get out! Get out! Get out!

31:25.960 --> 31:27.159
Please help me!

31:27.160 --> 31:29.242
There's something wrong
with my son.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.722
I think it may have been
a febrile convulsion.

31:43.723 --> 31:45.519
That's when the brain overheats.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.806
It always looks worse
than it is.

31:46.807 --> 31:48.605
I've never seen
anything like this.

31:48.606 --> 31:50.601
We'll have to wait
until the tests come back.

31:50.602 --> 31:52.329
All his other results
are normal.

31:52.330 --> 31:56.319
He's obviously suffering
a high level of anxiety.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.002
Very committed to
the monster theory.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.331
That's an understatement.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.919
All children see monsters.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.604
Not like this.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.879
And it's getting worse.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.479
He's becoming aggressive.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.005
He could see a psychiatrist.

32:12.006 --> 32:13.559
I can refer you.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.085
Takes a few weeks to get in.

32:15.086 --> 32:16.241
That'd be great.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.279
But can you just give me
something for now,

32:21.280 --> 32:23.647
just to make him sleep?

32:24.720 --> 32:26.290
Um, just until...

32:27.520 --> 32:29.602
...just until
we get an appointment.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.839
Please?

32:32.840 --> 32:37.439
I haven't slept in weeks
and neither has Samuel

32:37.440 --> 32:38.803
and when we go home tonight,

32:38.804 --> 32:40.723
this whole nightmare
will start up again

32:40.724 --> 32:41.926
and I am really...

32:41.927 --> 32:44.685
...I'm really not coping.

32:46.840 --> 32:51.279
I can give you
a short course of sedatives.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.599
Just until the tests come back.

32:53.600 --> 32:58.279
Most mothers aren't too keen
on them unless it's really bad.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.203
It's really bad.

33:07.120 --> 33:11.519
These can make children
feel foggy.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.679
Perhaps some temporary nausea.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.759
They'll certainly
help him sleep, though.

33:16.760 --> 33:20.207
- That's for one week.
- Thank you.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.519
Why don't people
like me?

33:24.520 --> 33:26.519
Why do you say that?

33:26.520 --> 33:30.286
Ruby said people don't like me
'cause I'm weird.

33:31.480 --> 33:35.280
Sometimes people say things
that aren't true.

33:38.720 --> 33:42.639
You just need to take
your medicine, have a big sleep

33:42.640 --> 33:43.971
and not worry.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.119
I don't want you to die.

33:47.120 --> 33:50.119
I'm not gonna die
for a long time yet.

33:50.120 --> 33:54.205
Did you think that about my dad
before he died?

33:58.160 --> 34:01.639
Just take your pill
so you can go to sleep.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.879
I've got the day off tomorrow.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.848
Maybe we could do something,
hmm?

34:05.849 --> 34:09.079
Will these make
the Babadook go away?

34:09.080 --> 34:10.719
I think so

34:10.719 --> 34:12.529
but you have to promise me
not to mention it again.

34:12.530 --> 34:16.399
I promise to protect you
if you promise to protect me.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.159
Then I won't mention it.

34:18.159 --> 34:22.319
I promise to protect you.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.969
Come on.

34:34.760 --> 34:35.886
Come on.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.518
Can you stay here with me?

34:44.520 --> 34:46.359
Yes.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.599
I love you, Mum.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.329
Me too.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.479
Her nose
is broken in two places.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.288
She may need surgery.

37:48.289 --> 37:49.599
I'll pay for everything.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.284
You can't even pay
your own bills.

37:51.285 --> 37:52.606
Look, I really have to go.

37:52.607 --> 37:56.241
Claire, I think someone
is stalking me and Samuel.

37:56.242 --> 37:57.559
What?

37:57.560 --> 37:59.528
A book turned up
at our place.

37:59.529 --> 38:02.999
I threw it away but somebody
glued it back together

38:03.000 --> 38:04.729
and put it on our doorstep.

38:04.730 --> 38:07.999
Amelia,
I just can't help you right now.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.839
I don't expect you to help.
I just wanted...

38:10.840 --> 38:13.002
If you're that worried,
you should go to the police.

38:13.003 --> 38:15.731
I have to go.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.330
Claire!

38:37.120 --> 38:38.451
Hello?

38:40.040 --> 38:44.359
Mmm, Babadook...

38:44.360 --> 38:48.285
...dook... dook.

38:54.440 --> 38:57.239
Hi.

38:57.240 --> 39:01.039
I want to report someone
stalking me and my child.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.326
Can you tell us what happened?

39:02.327 --> 39:05.159
Somebody sent me
a children's book.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.079
And?

39:09.080 --> 39:12.119
And it contained violent
and graphic images

39:12.120 --> 39:14.084
of my child and me
being murdered.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.003
Can we have a look at the book,
please?

39:16.004 --> 39:18.159
I burnt it.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.759
You burnt it?

39:20.760 --> 39:21.839
Yes.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.241
Well, unfortunately, there's
nothing we can do about it.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.679
He's been making phone calls
to me as well.

39:29.680 --> 39:30.919
What's he been saying?

39:30.920 --> 39:34.439
Nothing,
just making these... noises.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.202
How do you know
it's the same person?

39:36.203 --> 39:38.567
Because of what
he wrote in the book.

39:38.568 --> 39:40.239
The book you burnt?

39:40.240 --> 39:42.322
Yes.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.081
OK.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.523
Don't worry about it.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.839
Did you get your things done?

40:13.840 --> 40:15.919
Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.

40:15.920 --> 40:17.645
That's why she shakes like this.

40:17.646 --> 40:19.322
Samuel, you don't have to
say everything

40:19.323 --> 40:20.526
that goes through your head.

40:20.527 --> 40:22.999
Oh, it's alright, love.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.799
He wanted to know
so we talked about it.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.359
He sees things as they are,
that one.

40:30.360 --> 40:31.999
Oskar was the same.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.650
He always spoke his mind.

40:33.651 --> 40:36.405
Do you have to
keep on bringing him up?

40:42.160 --> 40:43.599
Hey, Bugsy-

40:43.600 --> 40:46.519
Hey.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.807
Hey!

41:03.280 --> 41:04.964
Eugh!

41:51.920 --> 41:54.082
Don't come in here.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.319
I don't want to buy anything.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.319
Are you Amelia Vanick?

42:10.320 --> 42:11.319
Yes.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.799
I'm Warren Newton
and this is Prue Flannery

42:13.800 --> 42:15.525
from the Department of
Community Services.

42:15.526 --> 42:17.484
My son's only been
away for two days.

42:17.485 --> 42:20.881
He's not actually registered
at Babbage Bay anymore.

42:20.882 --> 42:22.999
If I could just come in
and meet Samuel

42:23.000 --> 42:25.080
and get you to look at
these papers, that'd be great.

42:26.040 --> 42:29.399
I'm just in the middle
of cleaning up the house

42:29.400 --> 42:30.919
at the moment.

42:30.920 --> 42:34.720
I'm sorry.
There's stuff everywhere.

42:37.240 --> 42:39.519
Hello, Samuel.

42:39.520 --> 42:43.366
I'm Prue and this is Warren.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.279
How are you?

42:46.280 --> 42:49.839
I'm a bit tired from the drugs
Mum gave me.

42:49.840 --> 42:53.759
Not drugs. Tranquillisers...
from the doctor.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.559
He had a fit yesterday.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.839
I'm really tired, actually.

42:58.840 --> 43:00.490
That's no good.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.322
May I have a glass of water,
please?

43:05.323 --> 43:09.484
Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.

43:16.080 --> 43:17.999
It's a real mess.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.321
I just found
this cockroach infestation.

43:20.322 --> 43:21.805
I normally have
the house sprayed.

43:21.806 --> 43:23.605
I did actually already
have it sprayed

43:23.606 --> 43:26.331
but there's this hole
in the wall behind the fridge

43:26.332 --> 43:27.924
and that's why I...

43:32.560 --> 43:35.119
I didn't mean
a hole in the wall.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.519
There was a hole
in the wallpaper.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.724
That's where they were
laying their eggs, I think.

43:39.725 --> 43:41.802
We've caught you
at a bad time.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.685
I'll leave you with this.

43:44.686 --> 43:47.203
We're required
to come back in a week

43:47.204 --> 43:48.929
to talk through your options.

43:48.930 --> 43:51.048
Here's my card.

43:52.240 --> 43:56.768
Mum,
I think I'm gonna vomit.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.923
What was
that noise I heard?

44:17.924 --> 44:20.683
I didn't hear any noise.

44:20.684 --> 44:22.887
Wind howling,
doors slamming.

44:22.888 --> 44:25.719
I declare, I think this house
is haunted.

44:26.244 --> 44:29.839
Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.

44:29.840 --> 44:31.759
Are you sick?

44:31.760 --> 44:33.000
Oh, no, Granny.

44:34.560 --> 44:36.559
It's only 6:00.

44:36.560 --> 44:39.211
Don't you want to stay up
with your mum for a while?

44:39.212 --> 44:40.599
No.

44:40.600 --> 44:43.524
If you go to bed now,
the pills won't work properly.

44:46.840 --> 44:50.401
You have to stay up for a while,
sweetheart.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.679
Where's its mother,
Skip?

45:06.680 --> 45:08.205
Koalas don't leave
their babies about.

45:08.206 --> 45:10.159
Are you off now, Dad?

45:10.160 --> 45:11.805
Yep.
Soon as I fuel up.

45:11.806 --> 45:13.679
Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch
on the radio

45:13.680 --> 45:15.920
and I'll be back before breakfast
the day after tomorrow.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.484
"And the Prince
and the Princess

45:19.485 --> 45:22.324
"lived happily together
in a beautiful palace

45:22.325 --> 45:24.721
"for the rest of their days."

47:03.240 --> 47:06.839
Babadook...

47:06.840 --> 47:10.639
...dook... dook.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.079
What are we doing?

47:46.080 --> 47:47.844
We're going downstairs.

47:47.845 --> 47:50.127
- Why?
- Because we are.

48:08.160 --> 48:10.999
Iris, Iris, Iris.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.759
No.

49:00.323 --> 49:02.084
Glass and mirror attachment.

49:02.085 --> 49:04.002
Clean and polish
shower doors or mirrors

49:04.003 --> 49:05.479
for a streak-free shine.

49:05.480 --> 49:06.811
As part of
your steaming special,

49:06.800 --> 49:08.564
we'll even include
the garment and upholst...

49:08.565 --> 49:11.928
Oh, I don't want to give it
to anyone at work.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.519
Alright.
Give all my shifts away.

49:16.520 --> 49:17.806
That's just what I need.

49:19.640 --> 49:20.966
I can't help it if I'm sick.

49:20.967 --> 49:22.325
What do you expect me to do?

49:23.480 --> 49:25.005
You do that!

49:38.880 --> 49:43.442
Mum, I took the pills
but I feel sick again.

49:45.080 --> 49:47.731
I need to eat something.

49:51.680 --> 49:55.241
I couldn't find any food
in the fridge.

49:56.960 --> 50:00.119
You said to have them with food.

50:00.120 --> 50:03.919
I'm really hungry, Mum.

50:03.920 --> 50:07.879
Why do you have to keep talk,
talk, talking?

50:07.880 --> 50:09.759
Don't you ever stop?

50:09.760 --> 50:13.239
- I was just...
- I need to sleep!

50:13.240 --> 50:16.599
I'm sorry, Mummy.
I was just really hungry.

50:16.600 --> 50:20.685
If you're that hungry,
why don't you go and eat shit?

50:52.840 --> 50:54.439
I'm so sorry.

50:54.440 --> 50:57.489
I don't know why I said that.
it was terrible.

50:58.680 --> 51:02.159
I've had absolutely no sleep.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.447
I didn't know what I was saying.

51:06.160 --> 51:08.049
I'll cook you something. Hey?

51:09.320 --> 51:10.606
What would you like?

51:10.607 --> 51:12.489
I'm not hungry anymore.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.082
We really need to get
out of this house.

51:21.083 --> 51:23.447
We've been cooped up here
too long. That's the problem.

51:28.080 --> 51:29.889
Do you want to go to Wally's?

51:30.960 --> 51:33.406
You can have anything you want.
Alright?

51:33.407 --> 51:36.961
Even ice-cream for breakfast
if you like.

51:39.240 --> 51:42.279
Give it back!

51:42.280 --> 51:46.199
- Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.
- No!

51:46.200 --> 51:48.089
- Now!
- Give my drink back!

51:48.090 --> 51:49.445
Sit down, please.

51:55.400 --> 51:56.606
Where are we going?

51:56.607 --> 51:59.570
I just want to drive
for a little while.

52:10.800 --> 52:13.039
Aarggh!

52:13.040 --> 52:14.959
Mummy! Mummy!

52:17.240 --> 52:19.359
Babadook.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.201
You ran straight into me!

52:31.202 --> 52:35.410
I just bought this bloody car.
What were you thinking?

52:36.640 --> 52:39.119
Oh, driving on the wrong side of
the road with a kid in the back.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.999
You could've killed someone!

52:41.000 --> 52:43.639
Hey!

52:43.640 --> 52:44.641
Hey, what are you doing?

52:44.642 --> 52:46.529
Hey! Crazy bitch!

52:53.000 --> 52:55.321
Hi, sweetheart.

53:03.080 --> 53:04.650
Mum?

53:06.040 --> 53:08.407
I can call Aunty Claire.

53:11.200 --> 53:14.124
I can call
and she can come over.

53:17.400 --> 53:18.799
Mum?

53:18.800 --> 53:23.203
Aunty Claire doesn't want
to talk to us anymore.

53:24.680 --> 53:27.763
Mum. Mum, look at me.

53:52.880 --> 53:55.451
It's nice and warm in here.

53:58.840 --> 54:00.968
I don't want you to go away.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.168
I'm not going anywhere.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.405
Mum?

54:25.720 --> 54:29.805
Mum, I don't think
we should stay here tonight.

54:31.080 --> 54:33.159
I can call Mrs Roach.

54:33.160 --> 54:36.846
I don't want you to call anyone.

54:39.640 --> 54:42.086
I just need to sleep.

54:46.080 --> 54:48.128
- Mum...
- Leave it!

55:18.200 --> 55:20.168
There's something
in the house.

55:34.200 --> 55:36.043
There's someone in the house!

56:29.120 --> 56:30.765
Mrs Roach...

56:30.766 --> 56:32.762
...can we come and stay
the night?

56:41.800 --> 56:43.719
Gracie, I'm so sorry.

56:43.720 --> 56:46.041
Has someone
broken into the house?

56:46.042 --> 56:49.005
- Sam said that...
- No, no, no. We're fine.

56:49.006 --> 56:50.843
Samuel's just being
very disobedient again.

56:50.844 --> 56:53.039
Oh, I was so worried.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.519
I told him not to call anyone.

56:54.520 --> 56:56.362
He asked
if you could stay the night.

56:56.363 --> 56:59.086
No, no, no. We're fine. I just
have a headache. That's all.

56:59.087 --> 57:01.003
I really have to go, though,
now, Gracie.

57:02.480 --> 57:04.003
I'm so sorry for troubling you.

57:04.004 --> 57:05.525
Yes. Talk soon.

57:05.526 --> 57:07.010
No worries. Talk soon.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.919
I told you not to call anyone

57:11.920 --> 57:13.809
and you deliberately
disobeyed me.

57:14.920 --> 57:17.044
Do you want to frighten
Mrs Roach?

57:17.045 --> 57:19.164
An old lady who can hardly walk?

57:19.165 --> 57:20.650
Do you want to make her sick?

57:22.440 --> 57:24.522
Get that bloody thing off!

57:28.480 --> 57:33.399
Is this the only way I can trust
you not to embarrass me

57:33.400 --> 57:34.845
in front of our neighbours?

57:39.360 --> 57:40.885
Is this what I have to do?

57:52.040 --> 57:53.159
I'm sorry, Mummy.

57:53.160 --> 57:55.322
It's just that the Babadook made
you crash the car and then...

57:55.323 --> 57:57.239
What'd you say?

57:57.240 --> 57:58.839
I said the Babadook...

57:58.840 --> 58:00.405
The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.

58:00.406 --> 58:04.083
He's just something you've made up
in your stupid little head.

58:04.084 --> 58:06.526
I just didn't want you
to let it in!

58:06.527 --> 58:10.079
I'll make sure nothing
gets in tonight.

58:10.080 --> 58:11.599
Alright, Samuel?

58:11.600 --> 58:14.039
Nothing is coming in here
tonight.

58:14.040 --> 58:15.530
Nothing!

58:51.200 --> 58:53.559
I feel sick.

58:53.560 --> 58:57.759
If you don't take the pill,
you'll feel worse.

58:57.760 --> 58:59.325
Mum, I don't think I need...

58:59.326 --> 59:02.244
I am the parent and you are
the child so take the pill.

59:24.760 --> 59:26.888
Good boy.

59:45.720 --> 59:48.639
Ohh!

59:48.640 --> 59:49.926
Mum!

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.802
Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.167
Come here, sweetie. Hey?

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.600
Hey.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.210
Hey!

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.930
Here we go.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.642
There's more
where that came from.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.004
Oh!

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.479
Aarggh!

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.686
What's the secret?

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.805
..letter of Max's, didn't you?

01:01:11.806 --> 01:01:13.279
No, not for a minute.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.087
Don't lie.
You called me a jezebel. Why?

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:17.208
- The north, east.
- Natural corset.

01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:18.611
With fresh meat.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.639
Only five...

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.961
You don't wanna go
in there all by yourself, do you?

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.081
Police say the woman
used a kitchen knife

01:01:30.082 --> 01:01:31.599
to stab her son.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.681
His body was found
in their basement.

01:01:33.682 --> 01:01:36.331
The woman later attacked
officers with a knife.

01:01:36.332 --> 01:01:40.399
They drew their guns
and shot her to death.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.285
Little is known about the tragedy

01:01:42.286 --> 01:01:46.079
but neighbours say the boy was
celebrating his birthday today.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.399
He had just turned seven.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.725
Samuel?

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.330
Wake up, Mummy.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.289
But you're the one who's asleep,
sweetheart.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.284
Don't go down there.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.450
It's not safe.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.849
Ohh... l thought you were dead.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.366
I thought you were dead.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.208
We're gonna be together.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.007
You just need to bring me
the boy.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.879
You mean Samuel?

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.087
You can bring me the boy.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.165
You can bring me the boy.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.683
You can bring me the boy.

01:04:04.684 --> 01:04:06.045
Stop calling him 'the boy'.

01:04:06.046 --> 01:04:08.159
I think it's going to rain.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.519
No.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.684
it isn't real. It isn't real.
It isn't real.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.479
Oh, no.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.524
No! No!

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.679
Bugsy!

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.559
Samuel!

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.210
Samuel.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:11.970
Bugsy's hurt
and we need to get help.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.807
You don't want him to die,
do you?

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.359
Samuel.

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:25.283
Are you listening to me?

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.399
Let me in, you little shit!

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.759
Let me in!

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.999
Let me in!

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.479
Let me in!

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:39.323
Let me in!

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.879
You little pig!

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.559
Six years old and you're still
wetting yourself.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.639
You don't know how many times

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.399
I wished it was you, not him,
that died.

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:14.084
I just want you to be happy.

01:09:14.085 --> 01:09:17.084
"I just
want you to be happy."

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:21.759
Sometimes...

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:25.439
...I just wanna <i>smash</i>
your head against a brick wall

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:28.559
until your fucking brains
pop out.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.559
You're not my mother.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.078
What did you say?

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.606
I said
you're not my mother!

01:09:34.607 --> 01:09:37.999
I am your mother!

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.399
Run, run, run,
as fast as you can!

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.959
Get away!

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.803
Didn't I tell you
not to play with weapons?

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.529
- Argh!
- Argh!

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.679
I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.762
I just wanted to make sure
you were OK.

01:10:41.763 --> 01:10:44.639
I'm OK.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:50.319
I know... this time of year's
terribly hard for you.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.439
And I know you don't want me
to go on about it, so I won't.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.479
But I just wanted you to know

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.439
that I'd do anything
for you and Sam.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.408
I love you both.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.244
Samuel.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.604
I'm sorry.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.239
I understand you're scared.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.079
I haven't been good
since your dad died.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.050
I haven't been good at all.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.088
I'm sick, Sam. I need help.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.811
I just spoke with Mrs Roach.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.959
We're going to
stay there tonight.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.770
Do you want that?

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.010
I want to make it up to you,
Sam.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.648
I want you to meet your dad.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.806
It's beautiful there.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.840
You'll be happy-

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.804
Sorry, Mummy!

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.319
Mum!

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.879
Mum!

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.008
I'm not leaving you.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.610
Mum? Mum?

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.084
You said
we'd protect each other.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.881
I know you don't love me.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.399
The Babadook won't let you.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.641
But I love you, Mum.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.287
And I always will.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:57.405
You let it in.
You have to get it out!

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.039
I don't want you to go away.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.559
No! No! No!

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.642
Mummy!

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.119
Mummy!

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.119
Mummy!

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.999
Mummy!

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.359
Mummy! Mummy!

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.439
Mummy!

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.959
Mummy!

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.639
What is it?

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.404
You can't get rid of
the Babadook.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.840
Ooh!

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.841
What do you want?

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.964
What do you want?

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.959
No.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.850
Keep breathing.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.009
Put your seat back, sweetheart.
10 more minutes and we're there.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.168
No.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.125
I think it's gonna rain.

01:17:21.126 --> 01:17:23.039
Stop!

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.439
You are nothing.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.599
You're nothing!

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.079
This is my house!

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.279
You are trespassing in my house!

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.159
If you touch my son again
I'll fucking kill you!

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.642
No!

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.801
Mummy, don't!

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.719
Don't!

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:30.563
Aaaargh!

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.959
Watch out for your mum's leg,
little one.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.883
He's fine.
I've had the stitches out.

01:21:44.884 --> 01:21:46.639
What time's the party?

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.923
Any time after three is fine.

01:21:47.924 --> 01:21:49.763
I'll see you in a few hours, then.

01:21:49.764 --> 01:21:51.279
Bye.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.999
Bye, Sam.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.284
That school's
a good choice.

01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:57.361
I've been doing
a lot of reading about it

01:21:57.362 --> 01:21:58.999
so I think
Sam will be happy there.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.650
He's been out of school
over two weeks now.

01:22:00.651 --> 01:22:02.599
It's time to get back.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.879
We needed some time
to sort a few things out.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.159
Mmm.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.919
Are you having a party'?

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.604
It's Sam's birthday today.

01:22:10.605 --> 01:22:13.799
My first birthday
I've ever celebrated.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.239
That's not true.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.766
Yes, it is.
My first party on the day.

01:22:17.767 --> 01:22:19.967
That's unusual.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:25.559
My husband died the day
that Sam was born.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.689
He got killed driving Mum
to the hospital to have me.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.719
Sam's just like his dad was.

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.759
Always speaks his mind.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.919
Well, parties are lots of fun,
especially when they're yours.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:43.519
My cousin's not coming because
I broke her nose in two places.

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.723
I'll take that for you.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.759
Good shot.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.959
Look, there's another one!

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.962
Where's your bowl?

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.883
Wow. You've got a lot today.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.399
Am I ever gonna see it'?

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.688
One day, when you're bigger.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.131
You go outside, and you don't
come in until I tell you.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.006
Argh!

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:16.919
Argh!

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.039
It's alright.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:20.679
It's alright.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.639
It's alright.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.130
Shhh...

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.085
Shhh...

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.009
Shhh...

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.770
Shhh...

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.121
Shhh...

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.319
How was it?

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.721
It was pretty quiet today.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.205
Come here.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:09.521
It's getting much better, Mum.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.559
Wait!

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.608
I have a new trick.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.799
Life is not always as it seems.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.644
Nothing in my hands.
Nothing in my hands.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.365
- That's great!
- I haven't finished.

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.563
Abracadabra!

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.679
How did you do that?

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.479
Come here, you.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.641
Come here.

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:10.160
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
