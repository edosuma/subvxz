48:00.009 --> 48:03.137
this approach is
perhaps more artful.

48:03.212 --> 48:06.045
Start at the end.

48:06.115 --> 48:08.106
Go straight to Helion Five,

48:08.184 --> 48:10.379
the last planet in the system.

48:10.453 --> 48:13.081
We approach from the night side.

48:13.156 --> 48:16.125
<i>Remove these cannon first,</i>

48:16.192 --> 48:19.025
then attack the larger
placements at speed.

48:19.095 --> 48:21.893
<i>We'll catch them on their rear flank.
And in ten days' time,</i>

48:21.964 --> 48:26.298
<i>the rest of those worlds
will tumble before us.</i>

48:26.369 --> 48:28.701
You see, as with most,
their blind spot...

48:28.771 --> 48:31.069
is right behind them.

48:33.142 --> 48:36.703
I've located an ion trail
which leads off-world.

48:36.779 --> 48:39.475
Then you should be
off-world, Vaako.

48:39.549 --> 48:42.143
I've deployed a tracker team.
One of the best.

48:42.218 --> 48:45.949
Wherever Riddick has gone, you
lens him out and cleanse him.

48:46.749 --> 48:47.749
You.

48:47.773 --> 48:50.939
You want me to take a
frigate for one breeder?

48:50.993 --> 48:53.052
Don't question it, Vaako!

48:54.964 --> 48:58.161
Take it on faith.

49:01.337 --> 49:04.738
He's always been
unsettled around you...

49:04.807 --> 49:06.832
the Lord Marshal.

49:06.909 --> 49:09.810
Unsteady.

49:09.879 --> 49:13.542
Perhaps because he knows he's
half the warrior you are.

49:13.616 --> 49:16.676
<i>Some say he's too
artistic for the job.</i>

49:18.187 --> 49:20.815
I wouldn't be surprised if
someone promoted him soon...

49:20.890 --> 49:23.825
<i>to full dead.</i>

49:26.229 --> 49:28.163
Take care what you say.

49:28.231 --> 49:31.132
Should I say it softly?

49:31.200 --> 49:34.169
So it sounds more
like conspiracy?

49:34.237 --> 49:38.071
Oh, why is it that when anyone breathes
about the demise of him on the throne...

49:38.141 --> 49:40.803
everyone assumes a conspiracy?

49:42.512 --> 49:45.879
Why isn't that just
prudent planning?

49:45.948 --> 49:48.473
When he is ready, he
will name a successor.

49:48.551 --> 49:50.644
Who?

49:50.720 --> 49:54.986
Toal? Scales? The Purifier?

49:55.057 --> 49:57.389
None of them...

49:57.460 --> 50:00.224
with the strength, the dignity,

50:00.296 --> 50:04.392
of Lord Vaako.

50:04.467 --> 50:06.697
You can keep what you kill.

50:06.769 --> 50:10.034
- Stop.
- That is the Necromonger way.

50:10.106 --> 50:13.667
I said... stop.
(GRUNTS)

50:13.743 --> 50:17.110
His death will come in due
time and not a moment sooner.

50:17.180 --> 50:17.899
Why?

50:17.924 --> 50:20.799
Because I serve him. We all serve him.
It's called fidelity.

50:20.850 --> 50:23.011
It's called stupidity.

50:23.085 --> 50:25.849

51:03.726 --> 51:06.160
I wanna go down in Necropolis.

51:08.064 --> 51:10.055
Right now.

51:10.132 --> 51:15.160

He sees everything.

is the Furyan hiding now?

01:02:00.282 --> 01:02:02.113

And then you gotta

never see daylight again?

01:02:07.556 --> 01:02:11.151

What are you gonna do, huh?
Go for the sweet spot?

01:02:19.401 --> 01:02:22.768
Remember who you're
talkin' to, Jack.

01:02:24.506 --> 01:02:27.839
Jack's dead. She was weak.

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.479
She couldn't cut it.

They can be quite a test,
these deep runs...

tests of our inner selves.

01:03:36.111 --> 01:03:38.477
Don't you find that true?

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.476
Some men do.

01:03:45.887 --> 01:03:48.412
<i>Just being so far
from the armada,</i>

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:54.360
the mind can start to fill

01:03:54.429 --> 01:03:57.364
Don't you ever have
doubts, Vaako?

01:04:00.802 --> 01:04:03.293
- Doubts?
- About the campaign.

01:04:04.306 --> 01:04:06.467
About Lord Marshal.

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:12.846
First and always, I am a
Necromonger commander.

01:04:13.915 --> 01:04:19.012
So if you're here to test my loyalty, you
succeed only in testing my patience.

01:04:19.087 --> 01:04:22.682
Oh, no. No, that's not
why I'm here at all.

01:04:44.112 --> 01:04:46.808
<i>DAME VAAKO: I'm so glad I could
steal you away for a moment.</i>

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:49.282
Doesn't it strike you odd?

01:04:49.351 --> 01:04:51.979
<i>Here we have the current
Lord Marshal...</i>

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:56.150
<i>destroying entire societies, and
yet he can't bring himself...</i>

01:04:56.224 --> 01:05:00.183
to kill one stranded Elemental.

01:05:00.262 --> 01:05:02.196
Why is that?

01:05:03.398 --> 01:05:05.332
You don't pray to our god.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.960
You pray to no god, I hear.

01:05:08.036 --> 01:05:11.028
Elementals... we calculate.

01:05:12.107 --> 01:05:14.041
Don't we all.

01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:18.011
But now let's have
first things first.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.520
What of Riddick?

01:05:19.545 --> 01:05:21.335
In truth, I don't
know where he went.

01:05:21.383 --> 01:05:24.318
In truth, I'm more interested
in where he came from.

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:28.685
Watch your step.

01:05:28.757 --> 01:05:31.453
I've always wondered,

01:05:31.526 --> 01:05:34.120
does an air Elemental fly?

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.187
<i>Now do me a favor.</i>

01:05:36.264 --> 01:05:40.223
Calculate the odds of you getting
off this planet alive...

01:05:40.302 --> 01:05:42.293
and now cut them in half.

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:45.673
No, we can't fly.

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:48.209
But we glide very well.

01:05:48.276 --> 01:05:51.074
<i>Save your threats, Necromonger.</i>

01:05:52.147 --> 01:05:55.708
I would have told you about
Riddick for the asking.

01:05:55.784 --> 01:05:59.584
It concerns a foretelling, a
prediction now more than 30 years old.

01:05:59.654 --> 01:06:03.954
<i>A young warrior once
consulted a seer.</i>

01:06:04.025 --> 01:06:09.088
<i>He was told a child would be born on
the planet Furya... a male child...</i>

01:06:09.164 --> 01:06:13.567
<i>who would someday cause
the warrior's downfall.</i>

01:06:13.635 --> 01:06:17.230
<i>FEMALE VOICE:
Cause his untimed death.</i>

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:23.200
Furya? Furya's a ruined world.
No life to speak of.

01:06:23.278 --> 01:06:24.836
For good reason.

01:06:24.913 --> 01:06:29.907
This young warrior mounted
an attack on Furya,

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:33.079
killing all young
males he could find,

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:37.251
even strangling some
with their birth cords.

01:06:37.325 --> 01:06:40.123
An artful stroke,
wouldn't you say?

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:46.057
So this warrior, the one who tried to outwit
the prediction, would later become...

01:06:46.134 --> 01:06:48.159
That's why he worries.

01:06:48.236 --> 01:06:50.227
The Lord Marshal.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.831
Which would make
the man-child...

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:56.377
He worries he missed killing
that child in its crib.

01:06:56.444 --> 01:06:58.435
Riddick.

01:58:44.116 --> 01:58:47.108
These are his last moments.

01:59:03.702 --> 01:59:06.637
(GRUNTING)

01:59:06.705 --> 01:59:09.538
Give me your soul.

01:59:14.546 --> 01:59:17.982
- Fuck you!
- (GROANS)

01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:20.382
(GROWLS)

01:59:22.287 --> 01:59:23.845
(GRUNTS)

01:59:28.593 --> 01:59:30.493
(YELLS)

01:59:46.945 --> 01:59:49.243
(GRUNTING)

02:00:06.565 --> 02:00:08.590
(GRUNTS)

02:00:10.002 --> 02:00:12.470
(GRUNTING)

02:00:23.281 --> 02:00:25.545
You're not the one
to bring me down.

02:00:26.551 --> 02:00:27.984
(GROANS)

02:00:37.562 --> 02:00:39.621
(GASPS)

02:00:42.734 --> 02:00:44.463
(GROANS)

02:00:44.536 --> 02:00:47.266
Now! Kill the beast
while he's wounded!

02:00:57.649 --> 02:01:00.482
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

02:01:01.853 --> 02:01:04.879
(GROANING)

02:01:04.956 --> 02:01:07.982
Help me, Vaako. Kill him.

02:01:15.634 --> 02:01:16.965
Vaako?

02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:23.631
Forgive me.

02:01:23.708 --> 02:01:25.403
Flawless.

02:01:56.274 --> 02:01:58.742
(GASPS)
No.

02:02:04.816 --> 02:02:08.217
No-o-o!
(ECHOING)

02:02:08.286 --> 02:02:11.380
Now what would be
the odds of that?

02:02:24.369 --> 02:02:26.963
I thought you were dead.

02:02:29.207 --> 02:02:31.767
Are you with me, Kyra?

02:02:33.845 --> 02:02:36.405
(SIGHS)
I was always with you.

02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:40.741
I was.

02:04:04.302 --> 02:04:06.634
You keep what you kill.
