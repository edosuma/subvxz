00:07.669 --> 00:09.744
I can't believe I get to
spend the whole day here.

00:09.812 --> 00:12.314
When do I get to shoot the crossbows?

00:12.382 --> 00:14.616
Well, you're 13.
I don't even think it's legal.

00:14.684 --> 00:16.718
So we should do it after lunch.

00:16.786 --> 00:18.087
Yes!

00:18.154 --> 00:20.921
Welcome, welcome.
What a pleasure. Mike. Eve.

00:20.989 --> 00:23.791
I love "take your daughter
to work" day...

00:23.858 --> 00:25.793
And not just because

00:25.860 --> 00:28.367
Curly's daughter's the former
miss Colorado runner-up, huh?

00:28.487 --> 00:29.056
Wow.

00:31.467 --> 00:32.665
It's hard to imagine

00:32.734 --> 00:33.968
how beautiful
the mom would have to be.

00:35.537 --> 00:37.437
Remember me, Mr. Baxter?

00:37.505 --> 00:38.508
- Is this who I think it is?
- Ah.

00:38.628 --> 00:40.974
Gabriella, look at you. Wow.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.853
Eve, my daughter Gabriella.

00:42.973 --> 00:43.568
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:43.688 --> 00:45.579
Just graduated from
the Wharton School of Business.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.115
4.0 G.P.A., top of the class.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.516
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

00:49.584 --> 00:53.385
Wow. Eve can throw a fastball
50 miles an hour.

00:53.453 --> 00:57.623
It's not a competition, dad,
and actually, it's 53, so...

00:57.690 --> 00:59.125
Wow.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.960
So Wharton School--that's very
impressive--business school.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.795
Thank you,
and I'm really impressed with

01:03.863 --> 01:05.764
some of the things you guys are
doing over here at outdoor man.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.399
Yeah. Thanks.
I appreciate that.

01:07.467 --> 01:08.566
Although there are
other things that are like,

01:08.634 --> 01:11.202
"whoa.
What were you thinking?"

01:12.471 --> 01:15.039
She's not kidding, huh?

01:15.107 --> 01:17.609
Look, I don't want to step
on anyone's toes here,

01:17.676 --> 01:19.344
but it's been a while since
your business school days,

01:19.411 --> 01:21.078
and marketing has grown
much more complex.

01:21.147 --> 01:25.048
Yeah, I've been busy
<i>marketing</i> for 30 years.

01:25.116 --> 01:27.017
Well, there are a lot
of new theories out there.

01:27.084 --> 01:29.219
Well, I bet there are.

01:29.287 --> 01:31.121
So... want to get some hot chocolate?

01:31.189 --> 01:32.756
Thanks for stopping by.

01:32.823 --> 01:35.892
"Stopping by"?
Dad, you didn't tell him?

01:35.960 --> 01:38.995
Excuse me. Excuse me, Ed.
What didn't you tell me?

01:39.063 --> 01:41.096
Uh, d-didn't I mention
that we could possibly

01:41.165 --> 01:44.333
hire Gabriella
as a marketing consultant?

01:44.401 --> 01:46.269
No, you didn't--
didn't mention that, Ed.

01:46.336 --> 01:49.838
Well, I wish I had, because
seems I've gone and done it.

01:53.310 --> 01:55.778
I can't believe he hired her.

01:55.845 --> 01:57.412
Let me tell you something
about business school.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.748
You don't learn anything until
you get out in the real world.

02:00.816 --> 02:03.117
Gotcha.
School's not important.

02:03.186 --> 02:06.120
No, that's not what I'm saying.
You need a solid foundation.

02:06.189 --> 02:09.056
I hear you. Ed's daughter might
be an asset to outdoor man.

02:09.124 --> 02:10.692
No, I'm not saying that, either.

02:10.758 --> 02:12.126
What <i>are</i> you saying?

02:12.194 --> 02:14.127
I'm saying I'm very frustrated.

02:14.196 --> 02:16.897
I'm not trying to parent
or make any sense right now.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.800
Well, you're doing a great job.

02:19.867 --> 02:22.169
Thanks, little buddy.

02:23.538 --> 02:25.072
Dad, watch out for the dog!

02:27.041 --> 02:29.128

for www.addic7ed.com

02:32.646 --> 02:35.582
Hey. Dad almost hit a dog,
but we're okay.

02:35.649 --> 02:36.849
What?

02:36.917 --> 02:38.484
Well, "dog" is a bit
of an overstatement.

02:38.552 --> 02:42.188
Oh, my God!
He's so cute!

02:42.256 --> 02:45.156
Mom, can we keep him?
I've always wanted a dog.

02:45.225 --> 02:47.158
No, no, no, no.
We're not keeping that dog.

02:47.227 --> 02:49.728
Your mom and I have
very strong opinions about that.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.530
Oh, say...
"I'm not a dog.

02:51.598 --> 02:54.199
I'm just a cutie potato."

02:56.001 --> 02:57.736
What kind of dog is it?

02:57.803 --> 02:59.904
Ah, it's a Maltese.

02:59.972 --> 03:03.040
They were bred in ancient times
for rodent control.

03:03.108 --> 03:04.842
Apparently, ancient people

03:04.909 --> 03:06.644
wanted rodents to have
a fighting chance.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.147
So, dad, come on,
why can't we keep it?

03:10.215 --> 03:11.582
'Cause he belongs to somebody else.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.883
Somebody's probably worried sick

03:12.951 --> 03:14.985
that it slipped out of their purse.

03:15.053 --> 03:18.288
Oh, God.
Also, I'm allergic.

03:18.356 --> 03:19.856
Maybe we could just get rid of Mandy.

03:19.923 --> 03:21.258
Eve.

03:21.325 --> 03:25.262
What? I'm just saying,
is she really working out?

03:29.300 --> 03:31.668
All right, all right,
we're gonna keep Mandy for now,

03:31.736 --> 03:33.168
but the dog's going back--
end of story.

03:33.236 --> 03:35.604
But it has no tags,
so make up some posters,

03:35.672 --> 03:37.339
put 'em round the neighborhood,
canvass the area, all right?

03:37.407 --> 03:38.374
Yeah.

03:38.441 --> 03:39.408
And, Kristin...
Huh?

03:39.476 --> 03:41.009
Call vets, local shelters.

03:41.077 --> 03:42.511
See if anybody reported it missing.

03:42.579 --> 03:44.913
And don't fall in love
with this thing, please?

03:44.981 --> 03:46.715
Can I just hold him
for a little while?

03:46.783 --> 03:49.049
You can hold it
for a little while,

03:49.117 --> 03:50.217
but don't name it.

03:50.286 --> 03:53.688
Come on, Muffin. Mwah.

03:53.756 --> 03:55.990
"Muffin" actually butches
that thing up a little bit.

03:58.594 --> 04:01.962
So, uh, since when did Mandy
become allergic to dogs?

04:02.030 --> 04:04.998
Oh. Yeah, I might have
told her that when she was 4.

04:05.065 --> 04:09.503
It's really hard getting them
out of those mall pet stores.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.041
So you lied to her.

04:16.243 --> 04:17.511
Like you never lied?

04:17.577 --> 04:18.678
No.

04:18.745 --> 04:20.046
Huh? What about the time you told Eve

04:20.113 --> 04:23.349
that sugared cereal
makes hair grow on your back?

04:24.685 --> 04:26.485
How else do I explain your mother?

04:26.553 --> 04:27.753
Ohh.

04:27.821 --> 04:29.488
Ohh.

04:31.191 --> 04:33.559
And as this graph indicates,

04:33.627 --> 04:37.061
while we do well with our
core demographic--next slide...

04:37.129 --> 04:38.296
You don't need to say, "next slide."

04:38.364 --> 04:41.165
You have the controller in your hand.

04:41.233 --> 04:45.102
We are severely underserving
our youth and female markets.

04:45.170 --> 04:47.138
Listen, it's called "outdoor man,"

04:47.206 --> 04:49.407
not "outdoor <i>people."</i>

04:49.475 --> 04:53.076
We don't underserve them.
We just don't care about them.

04:54.278 --> 04:55.979
Ed, back me up.

04:56.047 --> 04:58.215
Uh, just go on, pumpkin.

04:58.282 --> 04:59.883
Next slide.

05:01.152 --> 05:03.019
She is making us look terrible.

05:03.087 --> 05:04.154
What do you mean, "us"?

05:04.222 --> 05:06.724
You know. We're a team.

05:06.791 --> 05:09.058
Kyle, I've been
working here 30 years.

05:09.125 --> 05:12.094
I don't even know your last name.

05:12.162 --> 05:15.698
Excuse me. Would you like to
add something to this meeting?

05:15.766 --> 05:17.433
No.

05:17.501 --> 05:20.970
It's "Anderson."

05:21.037 --> 05:23.072
Continue, Gabriella.
Continue, please.

05:23.139 --> 05:24.606
Here's what I'm thinking--

05:24.674 --> 05:28.142
a total redesign
of all of our retail stores--

05:28.210 --> 05:31.913
hip, young, minimalist.

05:31.981 --> 05:35.684
Additionally, we rebrand ourselves.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.787
Outdoor man becomes-- next slide...

05:38.855 --> 05:41.121
O.D.M.

05:43.592 --> 05:45.459
Or...

05:45.527 --> 05:49.062
And I-I think this could be
a real time-saver--

05:49.130 --> 05:51.198
we don't do any of this.

05:52.434 --> 05:54.468
Look, we need to diversify.

05:54.536 --> 05:56.736
Our average customer
is a 43-year-old male,

05:56.804 --> 05:58.237
and do you know why that is?

05:58.305 --> 05:59.773
Yes. Because they have all the money.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.376
And what they do is they trade
that money for our stuff.

06:03.444 --> 06:05.412
If we go this direction,

06:05.479 --> 06:07.947
we're gonna gut the soul
of the company we built, Ed.

06:08.015 --> 06:09.282
It's true, honey.

06:09.349 --> 06:12.084
You have very impressive
charts and figures here,

06:12.152 --> 06:14.052
but I've always gone with Mike's gut

06:14.120 --> 06:16.422
when it comes to making big decisions.

06:16.489 --> 06:18.089
Oh.

06:18.157 --> 06:19.991
Okay.

06:20.059 --> 06:23.762
And did Mike's gut tell you
to miss my school plays?

06:23.830 --> 06:25.497
Oh, honey...

06:26.920 --> 06:30.167
I'm fine. Forget it. It was
probably a stupid idea anyway.

06:30.235 --> 06:31.469
- Sweetie, please,
- whatever.

06:31.537 --> 06:34.038
I'll just be in my room--
I mean, office.

06:34.105 --> 06:36.541
All right, all right, what the hell.

06:36.608 --> 06:38.810
Maybe it's time
to embrace a new generation.

06:38.877 --> 06:39.777
What?

06:39.845 --> 06:41.078
Really?

06:41.146 --> 06:43.013
I just can't say "no"
to you, pumpkin.

06:43.081 --> 06:44.148
Oh, thank you, daddy.

06:44.215 --> 06:45.214
All right, okay.

06:45.282 --> 06:46.783
Don't worry about it, Mr. B.

06:46.851 --> 06:48.919
We can open up our own store.

06:48.986 --> 06:51.621
It doesn't have to be
sporting goods. You know...

06:51.689 --> 06:53.890
I bake.

06:56.894 --> 07:00.229
Everything you just said angers me.

07:06.778 --> 07:08.045
Hey. Okay,

07:08.113 --> 07:10.447
I canvassed the entire
neighborhood with posters.

07:10.515 --> 07:12.482
Did anybody call?

07:12.550 --> 07:15.186
Yeah. Tons of people.

07:15.253 --> 07:16.520
All guys, actually.

07:16.587 --> 07:18.022
Nice.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.323
Can I see that poster?

07:27.764 --> 07:29.532
Oh, my God.

07:29.599 --> 07:31.801
Mandy, that is not appropriate.

07:31.869 --> 07:32.902
What are you talking about?

07:32.970 --> 07:35.171
"Looking for my Master"?

07:35.239 --> 07:38.807
Yeah. It's a dog--

07:42.611 --> 07:43.778
Yeah. All right, well, we've checked

07:43.847 --> 07:45.247
with all of the shelters
and vets' offices.

07:45.315 --> 07:47.883
He's not chipped, and nobody's
reporting a missing Maltese.

07:47.951 --> 07:49.885
Speaking of which,
does anybody know where he is?

07:49.953 --> 07:51.519
He's playing in dad's office.

07:51.587 --> 07:53.054
In dad's office?

07:57.326 --> 07:59.293
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:59.361 --> 08:02.163
Ohh. Dad's African drum.

08:02.231 --> 08:05.632
This was a gift from an entire
village for bringing rain.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.635
It was a coincidence,
but he really went with it.

08:08.703 --> 08:11.604
Oh, boy. Your dad
is not gonna be happy.

08:11.672 --> 08:13.039
But you know what?
I don't care...

08:13.107 --> 08:15.208
Because
this baby's just the cutest...

08:17.845 --> 08:19.779
I forgot my allergy.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.948
You know, mom, I'm--
I'm feeling okay right now.

08:22.016 --> 08:23.616
I just--I keep remembering
what you told me

08:23.684 --> 08:27.686
about the doctor saying I could
just suddenly stop breathing.

08:27.754 --> 08:29.588
Mandy, honey, y--

08:32.759 --> 08:35.394
Better safe than sorry.

08:36.462 --> 08:38.097
I'm home, everybody.

08:38.164 --> 08:39.999
Well, nice knowing you, Muffin.

08:40.066 --> 08:43.201
What are you doing in here?
What happened to my drum?

08:43.269 --> 08:47.272
I got that drum for saving
a village by bringing them rain.

08:47.339 --> 08:48.606
Oh, stop.
You didn't save anything.

08:48.673 --> 08:49.774
You just stood there
with your arms out

08:49.841 --> 08:52.443
and sang the Michigan fight song.

08:52.511 --> 08:55.313
- Which they're still singing to this day.
- All right.

08:55.381 --> 08:57.047
This is irreplaceable.
Did that dog do this?

08:57.115 --> 08:58.015
M-Muffin didn't do it.

08:58.082 --> 08:59.049
Really??

08:59.117 --> 09:02.085
I... did it.

09:02.153 --> 09:04.221
You chewed the end of this drum?

09:04.289 --> 09:09.026
And I am not proud of myself.

09:09.093 --> 09:13.729
Did you also drop this cute,
little turd over here?

09:15.632 --> 09:17.433
Aww.

09:20.703 --> 09:22.738
Yes.

09:22.806 --> 09:27.009
That was me, too. I pooped.

09:27.077 --> 09:29.610
Well, you gotta
go get something to clean that up.

09:32.714 --> 09:35.283
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Mandy,
it's about that poster.

09:35.351 --> 09:36.517
Oh, great.

09:36.585 --> 09:39.421
Great. Excuse me?
I don't think so.

09:39.488 --> 09:41.789
Mandy already <i>has</i> a daddy.

09:41.857 --> 09:44.492
<i>You're talking to him.</i>

09:44.560 --> 09:46.827
Yeah.
That was one disturbed individual.

09:46.894 --> 09:48.728
All right. You know what, girls?
Take the dog out for a walk.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.464
Okay, but I get to
carry him this time.

09:50.531 --> 09:52.166
You carried him last time.

09:52.233 --> 09:53.700
How can you walk something
when you're carrying it?

09:53.768 --> 09:54.768
It doesn't make any sense.

09:54.836 --> 09:56.403
What's the matter with you people?

09:56.471 --> 09:58.005
You know what? Dad's right.
We're coddling him too much.

09:58.073 --> 09:59.706
We should get his leash
and his tiny sweater,

09:59.774 --> 10:01.307
and we'll go out. Come on.

10:01.375 --> 10:02.741
Have fun now,

10:02.809 --> 10:04.243
'cause I'm taking that dog
to work with me tomorrow.

10:04.311 --> 10:05.678
There's no more bonding.

10:05.745 --> 10:07.246
It's just gonna make it
more difficult to get rid of it.

10:09.183 --> 10:12.452
I've got a gun and bullets
with your name on it, pervert.

10:14.088 --> 10:15.355
Hold on. It's your mom.

10:18.691 --> 10:21.593
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for outdoor man.

10:21.660 --> 10:24.629
You know, man has
a long history with dogs.

10:24.697 --> 10:27.332
Ancient man bred these wolf hybrids

10:27.400 --> 10:29.734
to protect them when they
were eating around a fire.

10:29.802 --> 10:32.504
They also used that same dog to
attack other cavemen. 

10:32.571 --> 10:37.841
Big, huge, burly, nasty, fast,
angry animals, those dogs were.

10:37.909 --> 10:40.811
We've come a long way.
We went from those...

10:40.879 --> 10:43.180
To this...

10:44.949 --> 10:48.685
Bred entirely to be adorable.

10:48.753 --> 10:52.155
For those of you who are
affected by such things,

10:52.223 --> 10:57.460
it's great, but for me, nothin'.
This--no feeling right here.

10:57.528 --> 11:00.296
Don't care.
Lick all you want, kid.

11:00.364 --> 11:03.866
You know, sometimes...
Change isn't progress.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.068
Sometimes change is just change...

11:06.136 --> 11:09.704
Whether it's a hybrid dog
or a store like outdoor man.

11:09.772 --> 11:11.540
Still doesn't work, kid.

11:11.607 --> 11:15.810
Back off. Just back off.

11:15.878 --> 11:17.979
You know, just 'cause
you can change something,

11:18.048 --> 11:20.315
doesn't mean you should. Like this...

11:20.383 --> 11:21.916
Colt .45.

11:21.983 --> 11:26.820
Basically the--the same service
mechanism they designed in 1911.

11:26.888 --> 11:30.724
I would call it
the other "man's best friend."

11:30.792 --> 11:33.827
And all this month, we have
this along with other items

11:33.895 --> 11:37.130
on sale--outdoor man--40% off.
So stop by...

11:37.198 --> 11:40.600
Or the little guy gets it.

11:40.668 --> 11:43.070
That's a wrap, Mr. B.

11:44.172 --> 11:45.838
Hey, Mike.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.441
Look at that.

11:47.508 --> 11:51.178
Uh, that's a sad excuse for a dog.

11:51.245 --> 11:54.513
It's not a dog
if it can be killed by a cat.

11:54.581 --> 11:58.717
It's not a dog if it can fit
inside another dog's mouth.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.220
Or be carried off
by a medium-sized pigeon.

12:03.022 --> 12:05.924
Or if it can be
accidentally vacuumed up.

12:05.992 --> 12:08.961
Look at you two, making dog jokes,

12:09.028 --> 12:11.862
pretending you're not upset
about Ed's daughter.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.902
It's not a dog if it can--

12:17.970 --> 12:20.572
I think we're done here,
aren't we, Ed?

12:22.174 --> 12:25.042
Michael.

12:25.110 --> 12:27.411
This is my company,
and I am the boss.

12:27.479 --> 12:30.013
And?

12:30.081 --> 12:33.683
And I think your gut is 100% right.

12:33.751 --> 12:37.053
I just didn't want
to let Gabriella down,

12:37.122 --> 12:40.524
and I spent her entire life
not being there.

12:40.592 --> 12:43.392
I wanted to make up for it,
I g--in some way.

12:43.460 --> 12:44.860
You know?
Can you understand that?

12:44.928 --> 12:47.096
Yeah, yeah.
I do--I do understand.

12:47.164 --> 12:49.599
Listen, it's not like
her ideas are bad.

12:49.666 --> 12:51.700
They're--they're just not
right for our company.

12:51.768 --> 12:54.337
Yeah, I know, I know.
But she's pretty sharp, right?

12:54.404 --> 12:56.272
She's a great kid.
You should be real proud of her.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.439
Thank you, Mike. Thank you.

12:57.507 --> 12:59.874
But she's very annoying.

12:59.942 --> 13:02.977
Her mother was a monster.

13:03.045 --> 13:04.379
Hmm.

13:04.447 --> 13:06.748
You got to figure out how to
let go of some of this guilt

13:06.815 --> 13:09.050
and say "no" to that girl.

13:09.118 --> 13:10.652
Yeah, I know. You're right.
I'll be strong.

13:10.719 --> 13:11.686
Good.

13:11.754 --> 13:14.155
I'll talk to her. Thanks.

13:14.222 --> 13:15.055
Okay.

13:17.025 --> 13:19.460
Will you come with me, Mike?

13:25.333 --> 13:28.735
Gabriella?

13:28.803 --> 13:30.002
We need to talk.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.538
What is it?

13:31.605 --> 13:35.441
Well, it's about your idea for
modernizing the retail space.

13:35.509 --> 13:38.778
Yes. Okay. So here's
what I've been thinking.

13:38.845 --> 13:41.681
I-I-I can't do it.

13:48.288 --> 13:50.522
Gabby, what your dad is trying to say

13:50.590 --> 13:52.624
is that we can't go forward
with your plan.

13:52.692 --> 13:53.925
What?

13:53.993 --> 13:55.494
Daddy...

13:55.562 --> 13:57.996
She pulled the "daddy." I can't...

13:58.064 --> 13:59.231
Listen, it's a good idea,

13:59.299 --> 14:01.166
but it's just not right
for us right now.

14:02.601 --> 14:05.770
So let's see. You, uh...
You make a promise,

14:05.838 --> 14:07.706
get my hopes up,
and don't come through.

14:07.773 --> 14:11.342
That reminds me of something.
Oh. My childhood.

14:11.410 --> 14:15.479
Ooh, she's good. That's--nice shot.

14:15.547 --> 14:16.981
And on top of all that,

14:17.049 --> 14:19.416
you didn't even have the courage
to tell me yourself.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.519
Well, I-I-I tried to.
I-I didn't know how to tell you.

14:22.587 --> 14:24.554
I feel like an idiot,
and I've done all of this work.

14:24.622 --> 14:26.757
You should have been direct
with me from the start.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.126
Tell her I'm sorry I wasn't direct.

14:31.529 --> 14:34.130
Tell my dad, "thanks for nothing."

14:40.904 --> 14:44.640
I think I have an idea to help
you guys get back together.

14:44.708 --> 14:47.643
Hear me out.

14:47.711 --> 14:49.811
A Maltese puppy.

14:57.729 --> 14:59.450
Hey, Ed, can you
come in here a minute?

14:59.518 --> 15:01.385
Yeah. Sure.
Here you go.

15:01.453 --> 15:02.954
Yeah, Mike.

15:05.625 --> 15:06.791
Gabriella.

15:06.859 --> 15:08.326
Dad.

15:08.393 --> 15:10.729
Well, you I.D.'D each other.
There's a start.

15:10.796 --> 15:13.530
Listen, we have to repair
this relationship.

15:13.598 --> 15:16.399
It's just too important.
You only get one dad.

15:16.467 --> 15:18.636
And you only get--
how many is it now?

15:18.703 --> 15:21.404
Six daughters.

15:21.472 --> 15:23.540
Is that including the war baby?

15:23.608 --> 15:25.709
Yes, of course.

15:25.777 --> 15:28.377
Listen, the point is

15:28.445 --> 15:29.912
you got some guilt to work through.

15:29.980 --> 15:31.748
Divorce is hard.
You were a good father.

15:31.815 --> 15:34.283
You did the best you could
under a difficult situation.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.119
It's true.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.987
I always knew that you loved me,

15:38.055 --> 15:40.523
even though mom often
told me that you didn't.

15:40.590 --> 15:43.092
I told you she was a monster.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.560
Listen, you guys
want to work together,

15:45.628 --> 15:48.163
you got s stop treating her
like a little girl.

15:48.230 --> 15:49.698
Thank you.

15:49.766 --> 15:51.033
And if you want to be
treated like an adult,

15:51.100 --> 15:52.500
you gotta act like one,
stop whining and moping

15:52.568 --> 15:55.115
and saying "daddy"
every time you want something.

15:57.907 --> 16:03.110
Maybe I do play
on your guilt sometimes.

16:03.178 --> 16:05.179
I understand.

16:05.246 --> 16:07.848
Although you did leave my mother
and now I don't trust men.

16:07.916 --> 16:09.421
Okay, I'm done.

16:11.086 --> 16:12.653
Well, I shouldn't have
let you get your hopes up

16:12.721 --> 16:15.389
if I couldn't follow through
with your business idea.

16:15.456 --> 16:18.091
Well, I may be able to follow
through after all.

16:18.159 --> 16:21.094
Next slide.

16:21.162 --> 16:23.897
Okay, I say we open up
another web presence

16:23.964 --> 16:27.667
using your "O.D.M." Banner,
which is a very solid idea.

16:27.735 --> 16:30.536
That way, we don't alienate
our current customer base.

16:30.604 --> 16:32.437
Well, the younger demographic
I was targeting

16:32.505 --> 16:35.841
- prefers to shop online anyway.
- So we're good?

16:35.909 --> 16:37.167
It will empower us to recontextualize

16:37.287 --> 16:40.545
- our image to a--
- whoo! Let's just say "yes."

16:40.613 --> 16:43.381
It's great. Thank you, Mike.

16:43.449 --> 16:44.817
Don't thank me.
Thank your dad.

16:44.884 --> 16:46.651
He's the one that had the vision
to hire young talent,

16:46.720 --> 16:49.320
encourage it. The company's
better off because of it.

16:49.387 --> 16:51.823
Are you talking about yourself or me?

16:51.890 --> 16:54.425
Let's not spoil the moment.

16:57.529 --> 16:59.597
Hey, girls,
I got a little bit of news.

16:59.664 --> 17:01.699
The owner of the dog called.
He's on his way over here.

17:01.767 --> 17:04.000
So might be a good time
to say your good-byes. Come on.

17:04.068 --> 17:05.535
You knew this was coming.

17:05.603 --> 17:08.070
I'll go first.

17:10.775 --> 17:13.576
Uh... Mandy, honey...

17:13.644 --> 17:14.978
Honey...

17:15.046 --> 17:16.146
Yeah?

17:16.214 --> 17:17.748
You're not allergic.

17:19.217 --> 17:20.782
What?

17:20.884 --> 17:24.920
I-I just--I've been lying to you
for 13 years because I, uh...

17:24.988 --> 17:27.256
- I was trying to get you out of a mall.
- <i>What?</i>

17:27.323 --> 17:28.991
I can't believe this.

17:29.059 --> 17:31.060
Mama, you were there today
when I called the doctor

17:31.128 --> 17:33.562
- to make an appointment for the allergy shots.
- Well...

17:33.630 --> 17:36.216
I very likely would not have
let you go through with that.

17:37.733 --> 17:40.334
Give her a break right now.
Parenting's tough.

17:40.402 --> 17:43.304
Many times, you gotta
streamline conversations

17:43.372 --> 17:45.306
to avoid the big arguments.
We do it all the time.

17:45.374 --> 17:47.275
Yeah. Right. Wait, what?

17:47.342 --> 17:48.900
Honey. Married 30 years.

17:49.020 --> 17:49.978
We're--we're in the homestretch.
Yeah.

17:50.045 --> 17:52.880
You might as well know,
I actually like Chinese food.

17:52.947 --> 17:57.321
I just, you know,
don't like watching you eat it...

17:58.719 --> 18:03.657
Wow. I-I-I have been
going without since '87.

18:03.724 --> 18:06.193
I know, but it's that--
what's that soup?

18:06.261 --> 18:07.827
- The hot and sour, whatever that is.
- Yeah?

18:07.895 --> 18:10.930
It's slurping. It's--it's--
it's horrible when you slurp.

18:10.998 --> 18:13.465
I think the lie saved
the marriage. It has. Come on.

18:13.533 --> 18:15.101
All right, you know what?

18:15.169 --> 18:17.970
We are ordering
from emperor's palace <i>tonight.</i>

18:18.038 --> 18:22.074
Oh, Muffin.
You were the perfect accessory.

18:22.142 --> 18:25.110
You were versatile enough to
accompany a little black dress,

18:25.178 --> 18:27.478
but you also went
with jeans and a tee.

18:27.546 --> 18:30.182
Listen, Muffin, I'm gonna give you

18:30.249 --> 18:32.951
the greatest compliment I know, okay?

18:33.019 --> 18:36.087
You make me
want to be a better dresser.

18:37.890 --> 18:40.406
Take him.

18:42.327 --> 18:44.829
I know we didn't
get much time together,

18:44.896 --> 18:47.131
but the time we had was special.

18:47.199 --> 18:49.499
You're just about
the best thing I've ever met.

18:51.369 --> 18:54.461
I can barely
remember my life before you.

18:56.740 --> 19:00.509
And I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

19:03.214 --> 19:05.849
Thank God, somebody's here.

19:05.916 --> 19:07.808
Bring the dog.

19:12.222 --> 19:14.289
Hey there. Mike Baxter.

19:14.357 --> 19:17.392
Yo. I'm Elliot,
but my friends call me "Wenis."

19:17.460 --> 19:20.237
Let's just go with "Elliot,"
all right?

19:21.965 --> 19:24.166
Here's your dog. You've probably
been worried sick about him.

19:24.234 --> 19:26.034
Actually, it's kind of funny.

19:26.102 --> 19:29.871
I didn't realize it was missing
for, like, the first three days.

19:29.938 --> 19:31.839
How do you not know
your dog's missing?

19:31.907 --> 19:34.668
You know. Scorpio.

19:35.878 --> 19:38.612
What, is that short for "stupid"?

19:41.116 --> 19:44.317
Dad, you can't
give the dog to this guy.

19:44.385 --> 19:46.221
Well... It's his dog.

19:49.957 --> 19:52.525
He looks, you know,
responsible enough.

19:52.593 --> 19:54.772
Yeah, when I'm not high.
Right?

19:58.399 --> 20:01.466
All right. I'm outta here.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.768
Later.

20:02.835 --> 20:06.471
There you go.
He's gonna be fine. You know...

20:07.640 --> 20:09.870
Well... what?

20:12.174 --> 20:13.879
It's somebody else's dog.
What do you want me to do?

20:13.947 --> 20:16.447
I can't just tie him up,
put him in the basement.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.086
What do you want me--

20:22.288 --> 20:24.522
wait up, Wenis!

20:30.886 --> 20:31.904
Mike?
Yeah, babe.

20:32.024 --> 20:34.894
- That was a sweet thing you did for the girls.
- Yeah.

20:34.962 --> 20:37.730
When it comes down to it, you're
a real softy, Mike Baxter.

20:37.798 --> 20:39.732
Well, don't tell anybody, okay?

20:39.800 --> 20:42.134
You do realize that at some point,

20:42.202 --> 20:43.936
they're gonna stop walking that dog.

20:44.004 --> 20:45.471
I know.

20:45.539 --> 20:48.474
And then it'll fall to us to
feed it and clean up after it...

20:48.542 --> 20:51.042
Honey, I am well aware of that.

20:51.110 --> 20:53.344
Clip his little toenails.

20:53.412 --> 20:56.615
Well, hopefully,
we can outsource <i>that.</i>

20:56.682 --> 20:58.082
It's amazing.

20:58.150 --> 21:00.218
No matter how old those girls get,

21:00.285 --> 21:03.087
they give you that face,
you got to say "yes."

21:03.155 --> 21:05.289
Mm.

21:05.357 --> 21:06.257
Night.

21:06.325 --> 21:07.258
Night.

21:11.330 --> 21:13.131
Mm.

21:14.266 --> 21:15.699
What is that?

21:15.767 --> 21:17.435
My foot.

21:17.503 --> 21:19.570
Licking my foot?

21:21.873 --> 21:23.473
Good God.

21:23.541 --> 21:24.774
Ohh.

21:24.842 --> 21:26.343
Don't start-- don't talk to it.

21:26.411 --> 21:29.513
Say, "night-night," Booshi.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.660
Love you, little Booshi.
