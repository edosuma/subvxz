WEBVTT

00:02.961 --> 00:04.874
Hey, how are things going
with your parents?

00:04.875 --> 00:07.676
Not great.
They hired divorce attorneys.

00:07.678 --> 00:09.378
You know, speaking
of attorneys,

00:09.380 --> 00:11.647
if I ever needed
a lawyer,

00:11.649 --> 00:14.950
I would not hire
She-Hulk.

00:15.853 --> 00:17.786
You know what?
That was almost on topic.

00:17.788 --> 00:20.289
I'm gonna say,
"Good job, Sheldon."

00:21.192 --> 00:23.292
Wait, She-Hulk's
a lawyer?

00:23.294 --> 00:25.127
Yeah, she works at
a law firm in New York.

00:25.129 --> 00:28.397
Yes, but she's the only
monster at the firm.

00:28.399 --> 00:30.299
Between you, me
and the wall,

00:30.301 --> 00:33.736
I think she's an
affirmative action hire.

00:34.939 --> 00:36.939
Anyway, Dad's gonna
be here in town,

00:36.941 --> 00:39.475
so I won't be able to do
Christmas dinner this year.

00:39.477 --> 00:41.477
If you're not up
to hosting Christmas dinner,

00:41.479 --> 00:42.711
I'm happy to do it.

00:42.713 --> 00:44.279
You can even
bring your father.

00:44.281 --> 00:46.048
That would be nice.

00:46.050 --> 00:47.182
I've always wanted to do

00:47.184 --> 00:48.817
a traditional
Victorian Christmas.

00:48.819 --> 00:51.820
Parlor games,
goose and figgy pudding...

00:51.822 --> 00:54.490
Ugh!

00:54.492 --> 00:56.024
English pudding.

00:56.026 --> 00:57.793
Y-You get yourself all
excited for pudding,

00:57.795 --> 01:00.829
and here comes a cake
with raisins in it.

01:00.831 --> 01:02.598
I'm not going.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.766
You're going.

01:03.768 --> 01:05.934
Why do you hate me?

01:05.936 --> 01:07.469
I don't hate you.

01:07.471 --> 01:08.437
I love you.

01:08.439 --> 01:09.671
Well, you call it love,

01:09.673 --> 01:11.707
but it has a lot
of raisins in it.

01:14.145 --> 01:15.911
Amy, good luck getting
these guys excited

01:15.913 --> 01:17.312
about a dinner
with a theme.

01:17.314 --> 01:20.949
I gave up when no one cared
about my Tom Hanks-giving.

01:22.153 --> 01:25.154
I think a Victorian Christmas
sounds nice.

01:25.156 --> 01:25.888
I agree.
Why not?

01:25.890 --> 01:26.955
Me, too.

01:26.957 --> 01:29.057

02:00.203 --> 02:03.004
You know the best part
of working in the clean room?

02:03.006 --> 02:04.039
No allergies.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.340
Check it out.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.511
Oh, that-that...
that's a lot of oxygen.

02:11.515 --> 02:13.815
We should get
going to Amy's.

02:13.817 --> 02:15.517
Can you believe
there was a time

02:15.519 --> 02:17.319
when we would have
needed an array

02:17.321 --> 02:20.088
of giant Cherenkov telescopes
to detect cosmic particles?

02:20.090 --> 02:23.224
And here we are building
our own multi-wire detector

02:23.226 --> 02:26.194
like a couple of badasses.

02:26.196 --> 02:28.196
I know. If we were still single,

02:28.198 --> 02:31.466
we'd be tripping
over all that booty.

02:31.468 --> 02:35.503
Ladies do love a man dressed
like a kitchen garbage bag.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.411
Oh, no.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.314
How the hell
did a pigeon get in here?

02:46.316 --> 02:48.350
You shut the loading doors, right?
I thought you did.

02:48.352 --> 02:50.518
Do you know what a
disaster this is?!

02:50.520 --> 02:53.021
You mean 'cause this room isn't
supposed to have dust in it,

02:53.023 --> 02:55.991
and we just let in
a flying crap machine?!

02:55.993 --> 02:58.827
What do we do?
Should we call someone?

02:58.829 --> 03:01.696
And tell them that we
compromised all the equipment?

03:01.698 --> 03:04.065
Let's just get it out of
here before anyone knows.

03:04.067 --> 03:05.367
Okay, how do we catch it?

03:05.369 --> 03:07.769
Well, what if we turn
off all the lights

03:07.771 --> 03:10.038
except for one, and
it'll come to it.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.907
It's not a moth!

03:12.909 --> 03:15.276
Don't yell at me.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.612
You're not gonna get
any good ideas out of me

03:17.614 --> 03:18.680
if you're yelling.

03:18.682 --> 03:20.248
Okay, so if I remain calm,

03:20.250 --> 03:23.218
I'll get more gems like,
"Turn off the lights"?!

03:23.220 --> 03:24.786
Great, we're turning
on each other.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.055
That's just what the
bird wants us to do!

03:29.326 --> 03:32.527
So, Dr. Koothrappali,
long flight?

03:32.529 --> 03:34.963
20 hours.
Oh, that's rough.

03:34.965 --> 03:38.066
Not at all. Did you know that
when you fly transcontinental

03:38.068 --> 03:41.436
without your wife, you don't
pray for the plane to crash?

03:43.840 --> 03:46.107
Can you please talk
about anything else?

03:46.109 --> 03:48.376
Forgive me.

03:48.378 --> 03:49.577
How are you
and Leonard?

03:49.579 --> 03:51.479
Oh, great.
Everything's good.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.015
I see you got engaged.
Yes, we did.

03:54.017 --> 03:55.083
Let me tell you a story.

03:55.085 --> 03:56.618
Dad!

03:56.620 --> 03:58.653
Sorry.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.156
I'm sure you won't grow
to hate each other.

04:04.861 --> 04:07.362
Hey, Leonard. What's up?

04:07.364 --> 04:10.432
What? How did that happen?

04:10.434 --> 04:11.466
Yeah, okay.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.268
I'll be there as soon as I can.

04:13.270 --> 04:15.470
Sorry. I have to run
to the university.

04:15.472 --> 04:16.571
What's going on?

04:16.572 --> 04:19.374
There's been a problem
with our experiment.

04:19.375 --> 04:21.442
A bird got into the clean room.

04:22.279 --> 04:23.945
You want me to come?
Uh, no.

04:23.947 --> 04:26.214
You had a long flight.
You stay here and relax.

04:26.216 --> 04:28.716
"Relax."
Easy for you to say.

04:28.718 --> 04:31.052
Your mother isn't cleaning out
your bank account.

04:31.054 --> 04:35.490
40 years,
the woman never cleaned a thing.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.258
You're just
gonna leave him here?

04:37.260 --> 04:39.494
"Relax," he says.
Yup. Bye.

04:41.898 --> 04:44.933
♪ Here comes Santa Claus,
here comes Santa Claus ♪

04:44.935 --> 04:46.501

05:03.520 --> 05:04.819
Why'd you turn it off?

05:04.821 --> 05:07.856
Because in the last ten minutes,
Santa came to town,

05:07.858 --> 05:11.860
kissed Mommy and ran Grandma
over with a reindeer.

05:11.862 --> 05:13.995
I had a drunk uncle
who did all those things.

05:13.997 --> 05:16.264
Nobody sings songs about him.

05:16.266 --> 05:19.734
Maybe you'd like it more if you
thought of Santa as a superhero

05:19.736 --> 05:22.403
and his power is bringing joy
to children.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.173
My uncle was accused
of that, too.

05:25.175 --> 05:28.209
It turned out
to be legal in Oklahoma.

05:28.211 --> 05:30.178
Okay, new subject.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.080
Let's talk
about presents.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.748
What did you get Amy?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.283
Oh, we're not exchanging gifts.

05:35.285 --> 05:38.486
Come on, Sheldon, you
have to get her something.

05:38.488 --> 05:39.988
Why should I?

05:39.990 --> 05:41.923
She knows
that I don't like Christmas,

05:41.925 --> 05:44.859
and yet, every year,
she forces me to celebrate it.

05:44.861 --> 05:47.896
Not only am I going to this
foolish dinner against my will.

05:47.898 --> 05:50.298
At the Christmas tree lot,
there was mistletoe,

05:50.300 --> 05:52.433
and she kissed me
under it in public.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.703
Like we were the stars
of a Tijuana sex show.

05:57.140 --> 05:59.641
She's just excited
about the holidays.

05:59.643 --> 06:03.711
Yes, and she's not taking
my feelings into account at all.

06:03.713 --> 06:05.914
Maybe it's time
I teach her a lesson.

06:05.916 --> 06:07.715
How?

06:07.717 --> 06:11.719
Hmm. It'd have
to be something heinous,

06:11.721 --> 06:14.923
something that makes her
as miserable as she's making me.

06:14.925 --> 06:17.325
Oh, I've got it.

06:18.728 --> 06:21.596
This is good.

06:21.598 --> 06:22.764
What?

06:22.766 --> 06:25.900
I'm going to buy her a present.

06:25.902 --> 06:29.971
Yeah, you're gonna
have to walk me through that.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.173
With gift-giving, there's
an implied social contract.

06:32.175 --> 06:33.508
If I show up

06:33.510 --> 06:36.344
tonight with a present,
and she doesn't have one for me,

06:36.346 --> 06:38.980
she'll feel terrible.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.282
Then you're both sad?

06:41.284 --> 06:43.518
Yes.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.886
Maybe she'll feel so guilty,

06:44.888 --> 06:47.055
she'll never make me celebrate
the holidays again.

06:47.057 --> 06:51.993
So your evil plot here is to buy
your girlfriend a present?

06:51.995 --> 06:53.528
That's right.

06:53.530 --> 06:56.598
So stay on my good side, or I'll
get you a little something, too.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.672
Okay, here's the plan.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.874
I'm gonna put the food
in the bag,

07:06.876 --> 07:10.078
and when he lands in the bag
to eat it, we close it up.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.280
A Slim Jim?

07:12.282 --> 07:14.282
It's all I could find.
It'll work.

07:14.284 --> 07:15.416
Sure.

07:15.418 --> 07:17.252
If the pigeon's stoned
or a trucker.

07:19.956 --> 07:21.289
Okay, well, what's your plan?

07:21.291 --> 07:22.490
I told you my plan.

07:22.492 --> 07:24.158
Let's call Building Services
and get help.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.528
And admit that we contaminated
the clean room?

07:27.530 --> 07:30.064
No, admit that <i> you</i>
contaminated the clean room.

07:30.066 --> 07:32.233
Why do you keep assuming
it was me?

07:32.235 --> 07:34.469
Because you do this kind
of thing all the time,

07:34.471 --> 07:36.371
and then you try
to cover it up.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.373
Like when?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.808
What about when you
flipped the Mars Rover,

07:40.810 --> 07:42.477
or lost Koothrappali's dog,

07:42.479 --> 07:45.013
or almost drove off
with that baby?

07:45.015 --> 07:48.716
Again, it looked like my car,
and the baby didn't even cry

07:48.718 --> 07:50.885
until his mother punched me
with her keys.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.521
Fine, put the Slim Jim
in the garbage bag.

07:53.523 --> 07:55.490
Well, what if you said it

07:55.492 --> 07:56.824
without sounding
so condescending?

07:56.826 --> 07:59.093
I can try, but your
plan has the words

07:59.095 --> 08:01.162
"garbage bag" and
"Slim Jim" in it!

08:01.164 --> 08:03.364
Hey, what's going on?
Oh.

08:03.366 --> 08:04.899
Genius here wants
to catch a bird

08:04.901 --> 08:06.934
with a garbage bag
and a Slim Jim.

08:11.274 --> 08:14.909
Should have put it
in the bag first.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here

08:23.836 --> 08:25.604
So, if you don't
mind me asking,

08:25.605 --> 08:27.638
do you think you might
start dating again?

08:27.640 --> 08:29.106
It's much too soon for that.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.108
Why? Do you know someone?

08:31.110 --> 08:34.178
No, but if things don't
work out with me and Leonard,

08:34.179 --> 08:35.780
I'll give you a call.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.916
Wait. How much do you talk
about <i> Star Trek?</i>

08:40.553 --> 08:44.155
Okay, let's get this
Victorian party started.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.489
I've done some research

08:45.491 --> 08:47.758
about some traditional
parlor games we can play.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.993
Like what?

08:48.995 --> 08:53.464
Well, there's a fun one
called Ball of Wool.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.667
You take a ball of wool,

08:56.669 --> 08:59.170
and you put it right
in the center of the table.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.338
Then people sit

09:00.340 --> 09:01.672
on opposite sides of the table

09:01.674 --> 09:03.874
and try to blow the wool off.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.347
Sorry.
She's taken, too.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.584
You know what I think
your problem is?

09:13.586 --> 09:14.452
You're jealous

09:14.454 --> 09:16.053
because you and I
used to be

09:16.055 --> 09:18.789
best friends until
Koothrappali came along.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.292
And you found somebody
you could push around?

09:21.294 --> 09:22.593
Hey!
Stay out of this.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.129
Okay.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.264
You know, maybe I'm
best friends with Raj

09:27.266 --> 09:29.200
because he doesn't think
he's smarter than me.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.802
Actually...
I said, stay out of it!

09:31.804 --> 09:34.639
N-No. No, Raj, go ahead,
say what you were gonna say.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.840
All I'm gonna say is

09:35.842 --> 09:37.875
you guys need
to stop this right now.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.311
It-It's bad enough that
my parents are fighting,

09:40.313 --> 09:42.613
now I have to hear
the two of you?

09:42.615 --> 09:43.714
And who cares who's smarter?

09:43.716 --> 09:45.282
If it's Leonard or me or...

09:45.284 --> 09:47.918
you know, it's Christmas,
let's say it's Howard.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.858
Well, if you're so smart,
you get the bird out.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.092
No, you're the one
who let him in.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.128
How do you know
it wasn't Leonard?

09:57.130 --> 09:59.096
Come on.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.669
What about that sweater?

10:04.671 --> 10:06.137
No, it's not good enough.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.439
It has to be perfect.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.408
I think the nicest gifts
I've got from Howie

10:10.410 --> 10:12.143
show how well
he knows me.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.244
Hmm.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.980
Let's see,
what do I know about Amy?

10:15.982 --> 10:19.917
She loves medieval literature;
Chaucer's her favorite.

10:19.919 --> 10:23.754
And her eyes sparkle when
she watches old French movies.

10:23.756 --> 10:28.159
I enjoy how harp music causes
her fingers to dance

10:28.161 --> 10:30.261
as if she's playing along.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.264
Wow, you really do love her.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.933
I do.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.903
Now, let's find
the kind of gift

10:38.905 --> 10:42.206
that makes her feel
small and worthless.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.570
You won!

11:14.807 --> 11:17.842
Certainly doesn't
feel like it, does it?

11:18.711 --> 11:20.411
You know, my wife used to throw

11:20.413 --> 11:22.646
theme parties like this
all the time.

11:22.648 --> 11:24.982
Oh, I guess that's
where Raj gets it from.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.651
Well, he and his mother
spent a lot of time together

11:27.653 --> 11:28.986
when he was young.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.154
I was always working.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.690
Hey, you know, Raj is dating

11:32.692 --> 11:34.759
a doctor who works a lot.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.061
Him and his mom have a type.

11:37.063 --> 11:40.331
You g... Y-You got to laugh
at that, right?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.200
No? All right.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.706
All right, let me see
if I've got this straight.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.742
A picture of you on my lap

11:51.744 --> 11:53.811
is a way to punish
your girlfriend

11:53.813 --> 11:55.813
for making you
celebrate Christmas?

11:55.815 --> 11:57.381
Correct.

11:57.383 --> 12:01.252
Santa thinks dating you
may be punishment enough.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.290
There's an argument
for that.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.192
But I want to make sure.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.026
Smile.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.861
Ho, ho, ho!

12:16.369 --> 12:19.036
Okay. On the
count of three,

12:19.038 --> 12:21.238
I'll shoot the fire extinguisher
and get him airborne.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.774
Howard, you wave the blanket
and guide him towards the exit.

12:23.776 --> 12:25.876
Raj, you hold open the
curtain so he can fly out.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.345
Are you sure a dummy
like me can handle something

12:28.347 --> 12:30.481
as complicated
as a blanket?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.650
Do you want the
fire extinguisher?

12:32.652 --> 12:34.218
Yeah, I do.
Great.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.519
Here you go.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.721
Okay.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.393
One, two, three.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.765
Uh, you have to
take the pin out.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.271
You miss the blanket now,
don't you?

12:56.843 --> 12:58.142
On three.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.778
One, two, three.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.855
What did you do?

13:10.857 --> 13:12.823
It was an accident.

13:12.825 --> 13:14.959
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.861
Relax, it wasn't your fault.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.495
Uh, maybe it's just stunned.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.097
Dude, i-it's not breathing.

13:20.099 --> 13:23.500
Oh, no. I killed it.

13:23.502 --> 13:25.436
Oh, not again.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.372
What do you mean, not again?

13:30.309 --> 13:32.509
When I was ten,

13:32.511 --> 13:36.280
I was playing
in my backyard and...

13:36.282 --> 13:38.716
sat on a blue jay.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.653
I mean, I tried
to bring it back to life

13:42.655 --> 13:45.623
with electricity, but it just...

13:45.625 --> 13:47.491
caught on fire.

13:50.029 --> 13:53.631
The worst part was
it smelled delicious.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.067
Uh, guys, I found
an article here

13:57.069 --> 13:59.236
that says you can do CPR
on birds.

13:59.238 --> 14:00.738
Great! Do it!

14:00.740 --> 14:02.439
I'm not doing it.
You killed him, you do it.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.441
I'll do it.
No.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.309
I need to do it.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.511
This is on me.

14:11.717 --> 14:13.083
Okay.

14:13.085 --> 14:16.153
"Mouth over beak
and light chest compressions."

14:16.155 --> 14:17.321
Don't blow too hard.

14:17.323 --> 14:20.157
If you pop him, I will vomit.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.260
Anything?

14:23.262 --> 14:25.429
I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.769
Wait, wait, his wing moved!

14:31.771 --> 14:33.771
Oh, he blinked his eyes!
He's alive!

14:33.773 --> 14:35.205
It's a Christmas miracle!

14:35.207 --> 14:37.841
I might argue a Hanukkah
miracle, but I'll take it.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.811
Come on, little guy, let's get
you outside. Get the curtain.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.722
Someone should really
close that loading door.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.064
Well, that's that.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.732
The room's compromised.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.567
They'll have to change
all the filters,

15:03.569 --> 15:06.437
probably shut it down
for weeks.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.340
You were right. Go ahead,
call Building Services.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.542
Tell them it was my fault.
No, we're both to blame.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.110
You know, let me take
the heat on this one.

15:13.112 --> 15:14.378
Yeah, just leave me out of it.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.380
You know if they come here
and see crap everywhere,

15:16.382 --> 15:18.749
they're just gonna
blame the Indian guy.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.723
Hey. I'm sorry,
we're still here.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.157
Is everything okay?

15:27.159 --> 15:28.559
It's kind of boring.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.294
Although it did get exciting
for a minute

15:30.296 --> 15:32.763
when Amy inhaled a wool ball.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.232
How much longer
do you think you'll be?

15:35.234 --> 15:36.200
I don't know.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.701
There's still
a bird in here.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.970
We are gonna get in
a ton of trouble.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.872
Honey, it's Christmas Eve.
Who even knows you're in there?

15:41.874 --> 15:43.907
No, our names are on
the sign-in sheet.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.642
So erase them and walk out.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.344
I can't do that.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.479
Can't do what?

15:48.481 --> 15:49.646
She says take our names

15:49.648 --> 15:51.081
off the sign-in sheet
and leave.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.617
We can't do that.
Yeah.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.289
♪ Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way ♪

15:59.291 --> 16:00.991
♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪

16:00.993 --> 16:03.660
♪ In a one-horse
open sleigh, hey! ♪

16:04.830 --> 16:06.630
Mmm. Amy,

16:06.632 --> 16:08.499
that pudding was delicious.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.368
If you like raisins.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.670
Thank you. And it's figs.

16:13.672 --> 16:14.672
Oh.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.673
Oh, in that case,
it was pretty good.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.411
You feeling okay? You hardly
touched your goose.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.180
It smelled too much
like blue jay.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.416
Can I help you
clean up?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.951
Oh, you Heimliched a ball
of wool out of me; you're good.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.423
Uh, what do you say
we exchange gifts?

16:32.425 --> 16:33.690
Oh, Sheldon,
we didn't bring any.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.325
I thought you hate
giving gifts.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.327
Yeah, I do.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.696
Which is why I got Amy this.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.165
You got me something?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.267
Oh, not just
something, no.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.669
It's from the heart,
it's holiday-themed,

16:45.671 --> 16:49.840
and I swallowed the gift receipt
so you cannot return it.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.579
Look at you on Santa's lap.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.214
That's so sweet.

16:57.216 --> 17:00.250
Of course it is.
It's the perfect gift.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.819
H-How are you feeling right now?

17:01.821 --> 17:04.288
Guilty? Sad?

17:04.290 --> 17:06.490
Wishing you were Jewish?

17:07.626 --> 17:09.560
No, I love it.

17:09.561 --> 17:10.727
Oh, really?

17:10.729 --> 17:12.229
Well, how about now?

17:13.965 --> 17:17.334
Happy holidays to my dear Amy.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.471
I hope you treasure this

17:20.473 --> 17:24.308
as much as I treasure you.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.544
And you got me nothing.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.447
Christmas is ruined.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.249
Let's never speak of it again.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.052
Well, this was fun.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.753
Actually,

17:36.755 --> 17:39.456
I did get you
something.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.693
But what about our agreement?

17:42.695 --> 17:45.562
Well, you got me
something. Here.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.368
Cookies?

17:51.370 --> 17:53.904
They're your Meemaw's
Christmas cookies.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.007
I called and got
the recipe.

18:06.318 --> 18:08.118
They're perfect.

18:09.455 --> 18:12.456
It tastes like her hugs.

18:14.393 --> 18:16.693
Merry Christmas, Sheldon.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.531
I can't believe this.

18:20.533 --> 18:24.168
You're happy, I'm happy.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.537
Well, maybe a holiday that's
all about giving isn't so...

18:26.539 --> 18:29.072
Get your hand out of that box!

18:37.881 --> 18:39.013
Okay.

18:39.015 --> 18:42.917
The next game is called
Hot Boiled Beans.

18:44.754 --> 18:47.188
Of course it is.

18:47.190 --> 18:49.290
One person is sent
out of the room

18:49.292 --> 18:51.759
while the others
hide a small item.

18:51.761 --> 18:53.060
Then they invite

18:53.062 --> 18:54.895
the first person back by saying,

18:54.897 --> 18:57.131
"Hot boiled beans
and bacon for supper,

18:57.133 --> 19:00.634
hurry up before it gets cold."

19:02.973 --> 19:05.507
If you people think this is
better than Tom Hanks-giving,

19:05.509 --> 19:06.775
you're all crazy.
