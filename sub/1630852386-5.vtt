WEBVTT

00:17.392 --> 00:18.768
-Emily!
-Hi!

00:18.852 --> 00:21.146
Come, I want you to see this.
My first menu.

00:21.229 --> 00:24.232
Oh, my God! How exciting!
We have to take a picture.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.317
All right, just pose next to it.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.778
Okay…

00:30.739 --> 00:32.949
-Emily, perfect timing.
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:35.869
I got off the phone with Sylvie,
and as a favor to Maison Lavaux,

00:35.952 --> 00:38.121
Savoir will be doing
the press for opening night.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.789
We are? Oh, great.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.624
And she decided to make it your job.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.836
So, let's work hard
to get your man a lot of press, shall we?

00:44.919 --> 00:46.171
Not my man.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.715
We'll see you at Savoir tomorrow
to discuss the opening.

00:48.798 --> 00:49.799
Cool.

00:50.967 --> 00:54.262
You've seen where I work,
now I'll see where you work.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.015
Can't wait.

00:57.098 --> 00:57.932
Bye.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.863
-

01:13.198 --> 01:15.950
We're promoting
Chez Lavaux's opening night?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.494
Is that a question or a statement?

01:17.577 --> 01:21.289
As Maison Lavaux's account manager,
I was surprised to be the last to know.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.708
But I'm excited to get started.

01:23.792 --> 01:28.630
Well, now that I think about it, you might
not be the right person for the job.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.548
Given your history with the chef.

01:30.632 --> 01:35.303
Please, that is so in the past.
You know, like smoking in a French office.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.972
Sylvie, the person
from Chopard is here about the event.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.100
Oh, yeah, the Happy Hearts collection.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.893
I love those bracelets!

01:42.936 --> 01:45.230
Come on, Sylvie, let's get happy.

01:48.858 --> 01:53.947
Guests will arrive for cocktail hour
before the <i>bateau-mouche</i> departs

01:54.030 --> 01:57.784
for a beautiful night
of dinner and dancing on the Seine.

01:58.535 --> 02:02.539
Giving us the perfect launch
for your new collection.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.458
Yes. The guests will have
the opportunity to try on the jewelry

02:05.542 --> 02:08.419
while soaking in the romance
of the city from the water.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.671
I love it.

02:09.754 --> 02:12.841
These would be so perfect
for Valentine's Day back home.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.552
God, romance
is so commercialized in America.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.138
True. Valentine's Day is a huge holiday,

02:18.221 --> 02:21.683
thanks, in large part,
to marketing companies, like this one.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.602
Indeed, Americans
are very good at capitalizing on love.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.646
And what about the music?

02:26.729 --> 02:27.689
Music, yeah.

02:27.772 --> 02:28.648
Mmm-hmm.

02:28.731 --> 02:31.151
Julien, you're in touch with talent?

02:32.026 --> 02:33.069
-Me?
-Yeah.

02:36.614 --> 02:37.866
It's under control.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.164
The music was your responsibility!
You were supposed to book the DJ, no?

02:44.247 --> 02:46.666
No, it was most definitely
your responsibility!

02:46.749 --> 02:49.836
Stop, guys. Don't panic,
we'll just create a playlist.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.297
"Put a Ring On It." "Diamonds."

02:52.380 --> 02:54.632
"Diamonds and Pearls." "Gold Dust Woman."

02:55.884 --> 02:58.678
Great. Now the music
is your responsibility.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.098
Oh, God,
you actually had that in your head?

03:02.182 --> 03:06.144
What about live music?
It could be more romantic. Just a thought.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.771
That would be amazing,
but we don't have the budget.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.648
Budget may not be an issue.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.650
Are you free for lunch?

03:12.734 --> 03:13.568
Mmm.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.116
One, two, three, four…

03:20.200 --> 03:22.202


04:15.797 --> 04:18.132
She's so good, right?

04:18.216 --> 04:22.053
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted
by the hot man fingering the strings.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.263
Excuse me?

04:23.346 --> 04:24.722
The guitar player.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.642
I think they'd be perfect
for our Chopard Happy Hearts party.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.478
Yeah, well, I've got a heart-on right now.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.147
-Do you even know what you're saying?
-I do.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.816
Hi!

04:35.817 --> 04:38.194
-How was it?
-You were fabulous.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.154
And so are you! I'm Mindy.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.155
Julien.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.867
A-ha. <i>Enchantée.</i>
Emily has told me so much about you.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.203
And Emily told me you were a drag queen.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.164
Uh, so much gets lost
in translation.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.251
Anyway, I'd introduce you to the band,

04:53.334 --> 04:57.547
but Étienne's boyfriend just dumped him,
so Benoît is comforting him between sets.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.216
Boyfriend? Is Étienne the hot guitarist?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.634
No. That's Benoît.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.887
But I think he's single too.
What, are you down?

05:04.971 --> 05:08.641
-Down, up, side to side.
-He'd probably be into that.

05:08.725 --> 05:13.021
Well, maybe you can introduce them
on a <i>bateau-mouche</i> for our Chopard event?

05:13.104 --> 05:15.648
Is that an invitation or a job offer?

05:15.732 --> 05:18.401
-Yes and yes.
-Oh, we're so in!

05:18.484 --> 05:22.113
The boys are going to love that.
I've always wanted to headline a cruise.

05:22.196 --> 05:23.948
-Oh, it's not really a--

05:26.868 --> 05:31.372
You'll each be writing
a profile of your partner.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.876
Who they are, what they do,
why they are here in Paris.

05:34.959 --> 05:39.088
This is an excellent exercise to allow you
to master your descriptive vocabulary,

05:39.172 --> 05:41.007
and get to know your partner better.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.301
We will present
the profiles in the next class.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.219
Excellent week to all and good work.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.556
Okay. So should we
just get this out of the way?

05:48.639 --> 05:49.599
Excuse me?

05:50.224 --> 05:52.310
The assignment?
Were you even paying attention?

05:52.393 --> 05:55.104
-We're supposed to interview each other.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.233
Fine. I'm English, obviously.
Born and raised in London.

05:59.776 --> 06:04.405
I like football, and I work at a bank.
What else is there that you need to know?

06:04.489 --> 06:05.865
What do you do there?

06:05.948 --> 06:09.202
I specialize in financial services
concerning the post-Brexit transition.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.620
Oof.

06:10.703 --> 06:13.456
Settle down, it's very exciting stuff.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.125
I never really understood
the <i>meaning</i> of Brexit.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.420
Well, it's a combination
of words. "Britain" and "Exit."

06:19.504 --> 06:23.383
No way. Um, I meant
more like on a practical level.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.010
Well, to be honest,
I'm not too sure anybody really does.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.595
Practically or otherwise.

06:27.678 --> 06:28.971
Megxit, I get.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.768
Yeah. Everyone understands that.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.189
-We good?
-Um…

06:39.440 --> 06:43.611
Well, no, that's barely even three verbs,
and you haven't even interviewed me!

06:46.406 --> 06:50.785
Emily Cooper, American,
loves iced lattes, the beach…

06:50.868 --> 06:52.870
And what? Curling up with a good book.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.997
Let's think. Gemini.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.000
-Gemini? As if.
-I nailed the rest, right?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.336
No. Can you please
just take this seriously?

07:00.420 --> 07:03.297
Okay? Why are you even
in this class if you aren't going to try?

07:03.381 --> 07:06.092
Well, unfortunately,
it's a requirement of my company.

07:06.175 --> 07:07.885
I'm not, however, required to try.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.680
I mean, this is basically
the linguistic equivalent

07:10.763 --> 07:12.014
of traffic school.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.600
Okay. Well, it means
a little more than that to me.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.019
And since you're stuck with me,
make an effort.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.814
-There is a little cafe downstairs--
-No, I'm busy tonight.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.859
And mostly because
I don't feel like going to a cafe.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.861
I'm all Frenched out for the day.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.655
Okay. I hate to break it to you,
but we're in France.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.699
They pretty much speak French everywhere.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.493
You'd be surprised.
I'll text you when I'm free.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.704
See you later, Cooper.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.113
Oh. Hi.

08:10.072 --> 08:11.699
So this is where you work.

08:11.782 --> 08:12.909
You're early.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.162
I was a bit nervous I'd be late.
This is a big deal for me.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.831
A marketing firm behind
my restaurant opening. I mean…

08:18.915 --> 08:21.209
Chef Gabriel. Nice to see you again.

08:21.292 --> 08:26.005
We are all so excited
to be handling your opening.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.177
Okay, that one came out wrong.

08:32.970 --> 08:36.265
So to recap.
Phase 1 is creating awareness.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.644
I plan to direct social content
from Maison Lavaux's Instagram,

08:39.727 --> 08:44.982
which has increased 30% since I started,
to the newly launched Chez Lavaux account.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.319
That will help build excitement
for the restaurant's debut.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.779
What?

08:50.488 --> 08:52.990
Um, nothing. It's great.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.784
I just never…

08:55.910 --> 08:57.203
Please continue.

08:57.286 --> 09:00.081
Yeah, but not for much longer, please.

09:00.957 --> 09:05.753
Okay. So, um, cards on the table,
this is my first restaurant account,

09:05.836 --> 09:09.966
so just thinking out loud, um,
would you prefer a soft opening

09:10.049 --> 09:13.261
to get the kitchen up to speed,
or do you want to start with a bang?

09:13.344 --> 09:14.262
Bang!

09:15.513 --> 09:16.556
In my opinion.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.309
We don't want our customers
coming to a dress rehearsal, do we?

09:20.393 --> 09:24.355
-Good point, yeah, probably not.
-Okay, so that's decided.

09:24.438 --> 09:28.442
The last thing to discuss though
is building more content on social.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.153
So, Gabriel, I'm gonna have
to come to the restaurant

09:31.237 --> 09:34.073
and get some behind-the-scenes footage
of you at work.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.617
Of course. You're welcome any time.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.208
Emily. Perhaps you'd like to show them out
the very scenic back staircase?

09:44.292 --> 09:46.711
-Why would I do that?
-Because…

09:47.753 --> 09:49.922
Ah, Champère, welcome!

09:51.465 --> 09:53.050
Gabriel!

09:55.261 --> 09:56.971
What are you doing here?

09:59.890 --> 10:01.684
Visiting from Normandy?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.394
I…

10:03.477 --> 10:06.689
Actually, no, I never went to Normandy.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.775
Uh, Antoine here backed me up
in a restaurant in Paris.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.862
That's fantastic! I'm so proud of you.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.824
I guess that explains
why you didn't want our money.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.619
-Nice to meet you, Antoine.
<i>-Enchanté.</i>

10:20.661 --> 10:23.414
We represent Antoine's firm,
Maison Lavaux,

10:23.497 --> 10:26.375
so naturally we're also working
with the restaurant.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.543
Naturally.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.297
Well, it was so good to see you all.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.675
Antoine, shall we?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.011
Ladies and gentlemen…

10:37.094 --> 10:39.972
Such a pleasure.
Luc will take it from here.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.515
Sure, please follow me.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.025
This is so exciting!

10:51.108 --> 10:53.736
Camille, why didn't you tell us
about Gabriel's restaurant?

10:54.320 --> 10:55.905
Because we broke up.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.033
-What? I didn't know that.
-Start the meeting.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.370
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

11:02.453 --> 11:05.206
Because I didn't want
to hear, "I told you so."

11:05.289 --> 11:06.832
You never liked him.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.293
That's not true at all.
I like him very much.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.296
-I just thought he was a little stubborn.
-That's for sure.

11:12.380 --> 11:17.677
I propose to start with Champère himself.

11:20.054 --> 11:23.557
-I love it.
-Excuse me, uh, why don't we have Emily?

11:23.641 --> 11:25.726
She's the reason we're here.

11:25.810 --> 11:30.064
You can rest assured
that these are her ideas.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.566
Emily is not on the account anymore.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.651
Really?

11:34.777 --> 11:36.112
Why not?

11:38.739 --> 11:40.658
There's something else I didn't tell you.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.460
Well, it's no surprise.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.505
She came down to chateau,
and she banged your 17-year-old brother.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.216
In a long-term relationship, shit happens.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.592
Huh, sweetie?

11:58.676 --> 11:59.593
It's a test,

11:59.677 --> 12:02.054
and if you can get through it,
you'll wind up closer.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.223
Dad, I don't think so.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.103
Okay. Do you still love him?

12:12.022 --> 12:12.898
Um…

12:14.233 --> 12:16.318
I hate to admit it, but I believe I do.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.949
So I'm gonna help you, but you listen
to me and do exactly as I say.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.671
Well, Alfie,
I'm very impressed.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.090
You've found
the least Parisian place in all of Paris

12:38.174 --> 12:39.884
for us to do our French class assignment.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.343
What can I say?

12:41.427 --> 12:44.138
I like the fact I can order
a coffee in English and no one cares.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.515
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah, sure.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.601
Why are you in Paris
if you hate it so much?

12:48.684 --> 12:50.519
Well, one, for work, as I've said.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.106
And two, I don't hate it.
I just don't buy into the hype.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.816
Paris is built on a fantasy,

12:55.900 --> 12:58.319
and I just happen
to be able to see right through it.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.361
It's not all fantasy.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.447
Couples literally come here
to get engaged.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.240
It's "the City of Love" for a reason.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.202
Yeah, and that reason
is completely manufactured.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.705
This place is portrayed as this
end-all-be-all of romantic settings

13:09.789 --> 13:11.874
in books, movies, and Instagram, right?

13:11.957 --> 13:14.168
But the reality is,
choking on cigarette smoke,

13:14.251 --> 13:16.921
sidewalks covered in dog shit,
and tourist traps.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.174
Okay, well, it's also a big city.

13:20.257 --> 13:25.179
Exactly. Paris is full of traffic
and overpriced restaurants.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.389
And scam artists
just like any other big city.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.892
And I'm sure London is just the same.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.478
London is up-front about what it is.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.356
I mean, London doesn't pretend
to be something it's not.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.442
Meanwhile, Paris' reputation
is all a facade. Smoke and mirrors.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.820
It's selling you something
that's not real.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.364
I think it's all in
how you decide to look at it.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.659
-Right.
-Come on, let's get these coffees to go.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.831
This whole concept
of "the City of Love" was probably created

13:51.914 --> 13:54.625
by an American marketing executive
in town on business.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.378
Alfie, I am
an American marketing executive.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.046
You're joking.

14:00.047 --> 14:03.968
I assumed you were here as some kind
of American expat on a fantasy gap year.

14:04.051 --> 14:07.263
I work in a marketing firm
that specializes in luxury goods.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.015
In fact, right now,
I'm running point on an event for Chopard

14:10.099 --> 14:12.768
that is centered
on the very idea of Parisian romance.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.062
Right. You prove my point
with every word you say.

14:15.145 --> 14:18.691
Ugh! So what if marketing capitalizes
on romance, okay?

14:18.774 --> 14:22.403
Being a romantic and a realist
are not mutually exclusive.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.489
My whole job
is centered on finding a balance.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.783
-Our <i>bateau-mouche</i> party for Chopard--

14:27.867 --> 14:30.703
<i>"Bateau-mouche"?</i>
Is that what passes as romance these days?

14:31.537 --> 14:32.413
Okay then.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.873
-Hold that.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.169
Oh. Sorry, love, office needs me.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.755
I have a real job
to get to myself, you know?

14:41.839 --> 14:44.675
Yeah, you operate a love boat.
I heard you the first time.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.636
Look, I'm free tomorrow.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.890
And I'm not! You'll just have
to come to the <i>bateau-mouche!</i>

14:50.973 --> 14:52.683
Brilliant. Send me the details.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.226
Open bar, yeah?

14:54.310 --> 14:56.687
We're not staying for the whole party!

14:57.271 --> 14:59.273
Just come 20 minutes before!

15:14.413 --> 15:15.539
Was that good?

15:15.623 --> 15:18.083
-Maybe loosen up a little. Um, and smile?
-Okay.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.251
Uh…

15:19.335 --> 15:21.754
While I'm cutting squash? It feels weird.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.631
Well, take another sip then.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.132
Okay.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.386
-Okay, ready?
-Okay. Yeah.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.514
-Ready.
-Okay. Go!

15:48.364 --> 15:50.449
No. You have to cut that bit.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.284
-I look ridiculous on this one.
-No!

15:52.368 --> 15:55.037
-I think you look great. It was candid!
-Come on, no, please.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.622
-Please. Delete it.
-No!

15:56.705 --> 15:59.083
-Delete it.
-It's my account! You have to trust me.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.085
-It's my face.
-You have to trust me.

16:06.590 --> 16:10.469
So… did you get everything you want?

16:29.780 --> 16:32.074
Excuse me, is anyone here?

16:32.157 --> 16:34.702
Hi, sorry. I'm here for the interview.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.038
Right. The bartender job.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.250
-Has the position been filled?
-No. I was just…

16:42.668 --> 16:44.795
here to get some content for social.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.006
And I think we got everything we needed.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.591
-Uh, almost.
-Yeah. Happy…

16:50.384 --> 16:51.927
Happy interview.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.494
I see engagement
is high in the Chez Lavaux account.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.829
Bravo, Emily.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.582
You got some good content with your chef.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.335
He's not my chef. He's just a friend.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.212
Oh, please, I used to be a photographer,

17:27.296 --> 17:30.507
and I can tell
when you're in love with your subject.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.633
It's complicated.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.887
And I'm only in Paris for a year.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.513
Emily.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.643
You've got the rest of your life
to be as dull as you wish,

17:41.727 --> 17:44.271
but while you're here, fall in love,

17:44.354 --> 17:48.567
make mistakes,
leave a disastrous trail in your wake.

17:49.318 --> 17:54.281
If you're going to do Paris
for one year, for God's sake, do it right!

17:54.865 --> 17:57.242
I'm not sure
that Camille would agree with that.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.369
That may not be the issue you think it is.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.789
What are you talking about?

18:01.872 --> 18:05.167
Her mother called, and they want you back
on the Champère account.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.158
Emily! I'm sorry I'm late.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.159
It's okay.

18:39.701 --> 18:42.329
I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.081
Relax, it's okay.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.917
<i>Pardon.</i>

18:47.000 --> 18:48.127
Oops.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.837
-<i>Merci.</i>

18:51.004 --> 18:52.631
Thank you for texting me.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.218
-I'm so happy to see you.
-I'm so happy to see you.

18:56.301 --> 18:59.221
So, I've had the time
to think about everything.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.306
And I think I know what happened.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.309
You thought Gabriel and I broke up,

19:04.393 --> 19:07.479
he was leaving Paris,
and maybe you were seduced by the moment.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.606
So many stranger things
have happened in Paris.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.109
Exactly. Yeah. I would never have…

19:12.693 --> 19:14.778
If I'd thought
that you two were still together.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.865
Yeah, I just wish you had told me
from the start. As my friend.

19:18.448 --> 19:21.285
I regret that I didn't. Really.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.664
Anyway, my family is so happy
that you're back on the account.

19:25.747 --> 19:30.377
You came up with this brilliant idea,
and we don't want to do it without you.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.046
Thank you. I am so relieved,

19:33.130 --> 19:36.884
and, believe me, I will work
so hard to make it a huge success.

19:36.967 --> 19:37.926
I know you will.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.470
So, to a fresh start?

19:40.554 --> 19:42.014
<i>Santé</i> to that.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.725
And let's not ever let a man
come between us again.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.312
No. Never.

19:48.395 --> 19:52.149
Let's make a pact.
Neither of us will ever be with Gabriel.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.943
A pact? You don't have
to worry about me and Gabriel.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.278
So you agree then?

19:57.154 --> 19:59.698
-Yeah. Of course.
-Let's drink on it.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.242
To never being with Gabriel.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.786
To never being with Gabriel.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.338
You made a pact?

20:14.421 --> 20:15.422
Like an actual pact?

20:15.505 --> 20:19.384
I thought that only countries at war
or middle-school girls did that formally.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.888
And grown women who want to stay friends.

20:22.971 --> 20:26.099
She's not wrong. Without it,
it would be mutually assured destruction.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.310
With Gabriel as collateral damage.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.646
Are you telling him about this?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.147
No, and I never will.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.566
Fine.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.070
Well, why don't you
play matchmaker with me instead?

20:38.153 --> 20:41.448
Should we introduce Benoît
and Julien before or after the set?

20:41.531 --> 20:44.284
Definitely after. I don't want
anyone distracted until you finish.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.410
Oh.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.414
By the way,
we never discussed the fee for the night.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.042
Oh, well, we never discussed
your rent here either.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.754
Ah! Okay, um, good point.
Why don't we call it even?

20:55.837 --> 20:56.672
Deal.

20:58.882 --> 21:04.096
<i></i>

22:21.006 --> 22:22.382
Thanks, everyone.

22:22.466 --> 22:26.428
We'll be back in a moment
with another song.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.221
<i>Merci!</i>

22:28.847 --> 22:30.849
You sound incredible tonight.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.018
I mean, you always do.
But especially tonight.

22:33.101 --> 22:36.480
Thanks. Ooh, I actually
wanna introduce you to someone.

22:36.563 --> 22:39.608
-Me? Really?
-Yeah. I think you'll totally hit it off.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.194
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

22:42.277 --> 22:45.822
Julien, this is Benoît,
our guitarist. Benoît, Julien.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.324
Hey.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.202
-He thinks you're totally hot.
-Oh.

22:50.285 --> 22:51.745
-Mindy!
-What?

22:51.828 --> 22:54.706
I thought I'd cut to the chase.
Save you guys the trouble.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.459
-Okay, and I think you're totally hot.
-What?

22:58.293 --> 23:00.587
I thought I'd cut to the chase.
Save us the trouble.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.756
Wait, you're straight?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.050
<i>Merde.</i>

23:17.104 --> 23:18.105
Emily Cooper.

23:20.273 --> 23:22.484
I said a drink <i>before.</i>

23:22.567 --> 23:25.487
Now you're stuck
on the love boat for the whole party.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.446
Fine.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.449
I can spend the next two hours
telling you every little thing about me.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.034
But I'm doing it in English.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.246
Your whole anti-French thing
is getting pretty old.

23:34.996 --> 23:37.416
The way I see it,
I'm only here temporarily.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.751
Why bother committing
to something that can't last?

23:40.627 --> 23:42.379
You have a point there.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.304
That gets me every time.

23:53.014 --> 23:54.266
All right.

23:54.349 --> 23:56.143
Paris from this angle, at night,

23:57.102 --> 23:58.728
you got me there, Cooper.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.480
Hmm.

24:00.564 --> 24:03.024
-Yeah, but, I'm still not learning French.

24:13.827 --> 24:14.828
What's wrong?

24:17.831 --> 24:18.665
Oh.

24:18.748 --> 24:19.958
You okay?

24:22.544 --> 24:24.504
Hey. What are you doing?

24:25.297 --> 24:26.548
Ripping off the Band-Aid.

24:33.638 --> 24:34.556
Em.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.808
Are you here to finish what we started?

24:36.892 --> 24:37.767
Kind of.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.061
What's wrong?

24:43.899 --> 24:45.400
What's wrong is…

24:46.443 --> 24:48.361
I'm only in Paris for a year.

24:48.445 --> 24:52.574
It's always been the deal,
and I don't want us to start something

24:53.200 --> 24:54.367
that we can't continue.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.787
This, you and me,
it's a… It's a fantasy. It's a…

24:58.788 --> 25:00.749
-A Paris fantasy.
-Hey, hey, hey.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.668
It's not a fantasy to me.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.671
Just think about the reality of us.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.466
-No. Just think. Okay?

25:10.592 --> 25:12.260
We get together and then what, huh?

25:12.344 --> 25:14.221
What happens after the year is up?

25:14.304 --> 25:16.681
Because we both know
that you're not moving to Chicago,

25:16.765 --> 25:18.725
and I'm not staying in Paris.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.393
Then what?

25:21.102 --> 25:25.690
And I'm not going to fall in love with you
when we have an expiration date.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.319
It's just going to hurt us both.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.786
If you say so.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.126
If you'll excuse me,
I have a restaurant to open.
