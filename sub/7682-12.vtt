00:54.828 --> 00:59.124
Mankind is in the habit
of creating its own monsters,

00:59.124 --> 01:01.877
and fortunately, once in a while,

01:01.877 --> 01:05.297
it also gets the chance
to destroy them.

01:05.297 --> 01:09.760
A case in point,
this Trident II ICBM missile.

01:11.637 --> 01:14.640
The Pentagon
contracted with the Phoenix Foundation

01:14.640 --> 01:17.518
to come up with a plan
for permanent dismantlement

01:17.518 --> 01:20.395
and disposal of nuclear weapons.

01:20.437 --> 01:22.815
Watch the cradle.

01:22.815 --> 01:26.735
This Trident II ICBM
was the first of many more to come.

01:26.735 --> 01:31.573
It was up to us to make it harmless.
No small task.

01:32.032 --> 01:36.536
But we've been given a lot of training
to do it safely and to do it right.

01:36.536 --> 01:39.247
I considered my small part
in the operation

01:39.247 --> 01:43.669
as a hands-on chance
to do something for peace.

01:45.796 --> 01:48.423
All right, we're lined up.

01:49.257 --> 01:51.134
Pushing in.

01:51.134 --> 01:53.470
All right, that's it.

01:53.470 --> 01:56.598
Nice and easy. We've got all day.

01:58.391 --> 02:00.268
Wait, wait, hold it!

02:00.268 --> 02:02.395
- Easy, easy.
- All right.

02:02.395 --> 02:05.148
Move it in a little bit. Secure!

02:05.148 --> 02:07.984
Warhead number T-47 exposed.

02:08.151 --> 02:10.820
Missile Titan II secure.

02:10.987 --> 02:14.074
All right, people,
this is what we've been training for

02:14.074 --> 02:15.659
over the last three months.

02:15.659 --> 02:18.620
The eyes of the Disarmament
Commission are on us today,

02:18.620 --> 02:21.206
so look sharp.

02:21.206 --> 02:23.792
Warhead disarmament team into position.

02:23.792 --> 02:25.085
MacGyver, Reese.

02:25.085 --> 02:27.712
All right, Reese, come on.

02:41.351 --> 02:42.560
Power cable.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.146
Okay, here we go.

02:49.192 --> 02:52.820
Gentlemen, you've asked
the Phoenix Foundation to work out

02:52.820 --> 02:55.948
a fail-safe procedure
for disarmament and disposal.

02:55.948 --> 02:57.408
We've done it.

02:57.408 --> 03:00.787
We're starting to apply it
to some of the older missiles.

03:00.787 --> 03:02.538
Not that that matters.

03:02.538 --> 03:06.084
Disengagement
and uranium 235 are deadly,

03:06.084 --> 03:08.127
in any make or model.

03:08.127 --> 03:10.963
Okay. We're connected.

03:12.173 --> 03:14.759
- We got juice?
- Power on.

03:15.009 --> 03:17.595
Initiator online.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.686
Sequencing.

03:31.567 --> 03:34.195
We're in.

03:43.037 --> 03:46.832
Our man MacGyver is now going
in for the bomb's critical assembly.

03:46.832 --> 03:50.503
It's like reaching down the barrel
of a gun to get at the bullet.

03:50.503 --> 03:54.089
Then he has to separate
the bullet from the primer cap.

03:54.089 --> 03:55.674
It's no easy task.

03:55.674 --> 03:58.010
Don't fumble here.

03:58.010 --> 04:03.307
This charge has got enough
to bring the whole place down.

04:03.724 --> 04:06.935
- You got the igniter?
- I got it.

04:13.984 --> 04:16.278
Detonation assembly removed.

04:16.278 --> 04:19.697
Warhead T-47 is disarmed.

04:19.865 --> 04:23.035
All right, clear for disposal team.

04:23.577 --> 04:26.163
Commence transfer.

04:28.123 --> 04:32.211
The disposal of the ignition assembly
is the most dangerous part.

04:32.211 --> 04:35.339
Once it's secured,
we'll take it to an underground bunker

04:35.339 --> 04:37.966
where it'll be detonated.

04:46.683 --> 04:48.060
Warhead secured.

04:48.060 --> 04:49.770
What's our radiation level?

04:49.770 --> 04:53.523
.01 1 8 millirems per hour. We're clean.

04:54.066 --> 04:56.860
MacGyver, you have the honours.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.447
Yep.

05:20.133 --> 05:22.802
The next phase
is defuelling the missile itself,

05:22.802 --> 05:25.722
for which we require
a Delta T weather condition.

05:25.722 --> 05:28.558
You'll be notified as soon
as we have one. Thank you.

05:28.558 --> 05:32.312
- Thank you, sir.
- That was outstanding.

05:33.730 --> 05:36.357
That's one down.

05:41.779 --> 05:43.990
Ed, the team on this has been great.

05:43.990 --> 05:45.658
That's excellent, Peter.

05:45.658 --> 05:49.370
You know, after spending our youth
helping the DSX wage a Cold War,

05:49.370 --> 05:52.707
isn't it nice to be older, wiser
and part of the peace process?

05:52.707 --> 05:56.336
Yes, it is. For me, that's what
the Phoenix Foundation is all about.

05:56.336 --> 05:58.921
I've got a project
I want to talk to you about.

05:58.921 --> 06:02.800
It's along the same lines, and you're
gonna love it. When can we talk?

06:02.800 --> 06:07.138
Peter, you've been burning the candle
at both ends. Delegate more.

06:07.138 --> 06:09.599
At least on the missile
defuelling phase.

06:09.599 --> 06:13.686
No, Ed, I can't do that. The defuelling
process is the most critical part

06:13.686 --> 06:15.730
of the whole disarming procedure.

06:15.730 --> 06:18.858
I'm the one who laid down
the field operations schedule.

06:18.858 --> 06:21.194
It's my baby. I'm responsible.

06:21.194 --> 06:23.112
Careful, Peter.

06:23.112 --> 06:26.866
Burnout is not a job requirement.
I just want you to look after yourself.

06:26.866 --> 06:31.412
Ed, who beat who at the golf tournament
last weekend by five strokes?

06:31.412 --> 06:33.789
Don't remind me.

06:33.789 --> 06:37.209
Gentlemen. Kennan,
do you want to pass out the reports?

06:37.209 --> 06:39.420
Thank you.

06:39.420 --> 06:42.256
Now, first on today's agenda...

06:42.256 --> 06:46.302
As you all know, the Phoenix Foundation
has been playing an important role

06:46.302 --> 06:49.722
between our government
and that of the Republic of Sambaka

06:49.722 --> 06:51.682
over the last two years.

06:51.682 --> 06:53.809
And I'm happy to report

06:53.809 --> 06:57.271
that we have been able to persuade
their president, Yaman Amunde,

06:57.271 --> 07:00.107
to make an historic,
first-time visit to America.

07:00.107 --> 07:02.359
Perhaps congratulations are in order,

07:02.359 --> 07:04.737
but can anyone here explain to me

07:04.737 --> 07:08.407
exactly why President Amunde
would want to rub shoulders

07:08.407 --> 07:10.951
with us "decadent, mongrel dogs"?

07:10.951 --> 07:13.078
I think he wants to open a dialogue.

07:13.078 --> 07:15.956
Maybe even take a first step
towards reconciliation.

07:15.956 --> 07:20.252
No offence, Pete. Look,
I know what we're trying to do here.

07:20.252 --> 07:22.921
But Amunde and his thug cabinet

07:22.921 --> 07:26.133
have just been picking
our pockets for technical support.

07:26.133 --> 07:30.596
The whole time he continues to
head up a worldwide terrorist campaign.

07:30.596 --> 07:33.015
Anti-American rhetoric and posturing

07:33.015 --> 07:36.727
is not legitimate proof
of terrorism, Mr Webber.

07:36.727 --> 07:39.229
Still and all, sir,
it just leaves me to wonder

07:39.229 --> 07:41.565
whether we don't
have better things to do

07:41.565 --> 07:43.358
than to mediate with radicals

07:43.358 --> 07:46.945
who show absolutely no respect
for our democratic values.

07:46.945 --> 07:49.031
Matt, don't you think that our efforts

07:49.031 --> 07:52.117
to move Mr Amunde
and his government toward moderation

07:52.117 --> 07:55.537
are just as important
as disarming one more nuclear weapon?

07:55.537 --> 07:58.081
Forgive my cynicism.

07:58.081 --> 08:00.375
We will show the president a good time.

08:00.375 --> 08:04.212
Kennan, does Advanced Planning
have anything to report?

08:04.212 --> 08:05.756
Yes, sir.

08:05.756 --> 08:09.843
You'll note in your file, President
Amunde will be arriving in ten days.

08:09.843 --> 08:12.804
For security reasons,
everyone, including the media,

08:12.804 --> 08:15.807
will think he's staying
at the Garden Plaza Hotel.

08:15.807 --> 08:19.644
Meanwhile, he'll be staying at
Union Station aboard his own club car.

08:19.644 --> 08:21.521
His own private railroad car, huh?

08:21.521 --> 08:24.691
A textbook case of Amunde paranoia.

08:24.774 --> 08:28.653
He is the one with a working knowledge
of car bombs and plane hijackings.

08:28.653 --> 08:32.282
You are really dead-set convinced
that he's a terrorist, aren't you?

08:32.282 --> 08:35.326
Well, he's not front line.
He's worse. He orchestrates.

08:35.326 --> 08:36.953
Maybe, maybe not.

08:36.953 --> 08:39.789
I'm going to reserve judgment
until I see real proof.

08:39.789 --> 08:44.627
Two agents died on my last assignment
to DSX trying to get that proof.

08:44.627 --> 08:47.797
I know that, but if we don't
come up with a peaceful solution,

08:47.797 --> 08:49.424
more people are gonna die.

08:49.424 --> 08:53.261
Okay, what part would you like
your director of intelligence

08:53.261 --> 08:54.888
to play in this Amunde visit?

08:54.888 --> 08:57.932
To make sure we're on the
same page, why don't you tell me?

08:57.932 --> 09:01.019
Liaison with the
appropriate government agencies,

09:01.019 --> 09:04.022
cover all would-be avengers,
reactionary groups

09:04.022 --> 09:07.817
and pass on whatever
might put him in harm's way.

09:07.817 --> 09:10.528
Good man.
Couldn't have said it better myself.

09:10.528 --> 09:13.114
Keep me informed.

09:17.869 --> 09:20.455
All set?

09:51.944 --> 09:56.073
Did you see that?
Did you see what I did?

09:56.240 --> 09:58.909
Well, what's the matter?
I didn't do it right?

09:58.909 --> 10:02.454
You just stopped three great shots.

10:02.621 --> 10:06.041
It's pathetic. It's just pathetic.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.836
Well, I'm sorry.

10:09.420 --> 10:12.256
Whose idea was this in the first place?

10:12.256 --> 10:16.218
Not you. Me. You were amazing.

10:16.385 --> 10:18.846
Amazing.

10:18.846 --> 10:20.055
Yeah.

10:20.055 --> 10:22.516
Amazing Grace.

10:22.516 --> 10:25.102
Listen, I got a great idea.

10:26.395 --> 10:29.773
Why don't we... quit while I'm winning.

10:29.773 --> 10:34.319
No way. I want you to stay out here
and skate off some stress.

10:34.319 --> 10:36.447
I don't want you to be a burnout.

10:36.447 --> 10:40.576
Is that what this is all about?
Is that why you got me down here?

10:40.576 --> 10:44.204
Boy, I get it from Farrell at the board
meeting, and now from you here.

10:44.204 --> 10:46.957
All right, let me tell you
something. I work a lot.

10:46.957 --> 10:50.419
I'm a workaholic, all right?
But I'm not a burnout.

10:50.419 --> 10:54.631
No, you're not. But you're gonna be
if you don't put some fun in your life.

10:54.631 --> 10:57.634
Fun? You call this fun?

10:57.801 --> 10:59.344
Yeah.

10:59.344 --> 11:01.680
At least it takes the edge off.

11:01.680 --> 11:06.017
Especially after a hard day at the
office, taking apart nuclear warheads.

11:06.017 --> 11:08.145
Listen, in case you've forgotten,

11:08.145 --> 11:10.897
disarming those warheads
was only the first phase.

11:10.897 --> 11:14.526
The defuelling process, which you
are going to help me run tomorrow,

11:14.526 --> 11:16.820
is equally critical, if not more so.

11:16.820 --> 11:21.533
Yes, I know. All the more
reason why you should relax.

11:21.533 --> 11:22.826
You want me to relax?

11:22.826 --> 11:25.453
You want me to skate off some stress.

11:25.453 --> 11:28.081
Gimme your best shot.

11:28.373 --> 11:31.376
Come on! Give me your best shot.

11:32.210 --> 11:35.422
Come on.
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

11:35.422 --> 11:37.173
I'm ready.

11:37.173 --> 11:39.467
- Want your stick?
- Come on!

11:39.467 --> 11:42.053
All right, now, let's go.

11:42.053 --> 11:45.348
You think you're so hot.
I'll show you how to get rid of stress.

11:45.348 --> 11:47.267
Come on! Come on.

11:47.267 --> 11:50.186
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

11:54.691 --> 11:57.277
I wasn't ready.

12:00.405 --> 12:03.283
- Hi.
- Well, hi.

12:03.449 --> 12:05.243
What is this?

12:05.243 --> 12:06.452
That.

12:06.452 --> 12:09.664
That is the head of a former
Phoenix Foundation bureaucrat

12:09.664 --> 12:11.624
who was eaten alive.

12:11.624 --> 12:15.545
Cause of death, political infighting.
Happens all the time.

12:15.545 --> 12:17.213
Matthew, come on.

12:17.213 --> 12:21.175
All right. You want the real story?
This is my friend, Cheech.

12:21.175 --> 12:24.178
The rest of him won first prize
at the cannibal cook-off.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.806
Very funny.

12:27.140 --> 12:30.143
Speaking of which,
how about dinner tonight?

12:30.143 --> 12:32.311
Forget about him, just you and me.

12:32.311 --> 12:34.355
Oh, Matthew, I can't.

12:34.355 --> 12:36.691
That would make it
three times this week.

12:36.691 --> 12:39.277
Well... three's a charm.

12:39.277 --> 12:41.362
That's what I'm afraid of.

12:41.362 --> 12:46.075
Now listen, you wanted the investigative
report on subversive groups.

12:46.075 --> 12:48.327
I got it for you. Here it is.

12:48.327 --> 12:50.246
Back to business, huh?

12:50.246 --> 12:52.206
I'd love to have dinner with you,

12:52.206 --> 12:56.252
but I must go over the security briefing
with President Amunde's advance men.

12:56.252 --> 12:58.629
All right, okay,
I'll take a rain cheque.

12:58.629 --> 13:01.215
Do me a favour.
Can I have a copy of that briefing?

13:01.215 --> 13:03.843
It would help me coordinate
some stuff on my end.

13:03.843 --> 13:07.888
Absolutely.
I'll take care of that for you.

13:20.943 --> 13:24.113
What's so important
we couldn't discuss it over the phone?

13:24.113 --> 13:27.950
You know the opportunity we've been
talking about for the last two years?

13:27.950 --> 13:33.038
It's just been laid at our feet.
President Amunde is coming to town.

13:33.038 --> 13:36.125
- You don't say?
- That's right.

13:36.208 --> 13:39.086
The hierarchy
of the Phoenix Foundation has this idea

13:39.086 --> 13:42.506
that we can help bring about
world peace by coddling terrorists.

13:42.506 --> 13:44.424
You're working for idiots. So am I.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.553
The official position
of Pete Thornton and the Foundation

13:47.553 --> 13:50.305
is not to cast any aspersions
until they have proof.

13:50.305 --> 13:53.267
Proof? On Yaman Amunde?
Forget it. Just shoot the scum.

13:53.267 --> 13:57.271
That's right, leave it to you boys at
the DSX to cut down on the paperwork.

13:57.271 --> 14:00.399
Kelham! What's the
National Security Agency doing here?

14:00.399 --> 14:03.485
Defending the home front.
Who else is gonna do it, huh?

14:03.485 --> 14:06.071
We are. Come on.

14:16.706 --> 14:18.834
All set. Come on in.

14:18.834 --> 14:21.253
Well, I see we've got technical support.

14:21.253 --> 14:26.007
- How are you doing, Reese?
- Good to see you guys.

14:27.759 --> 14:29.052
What's this?

14:29.052 --> 14:32.722
My favourite lady at the Foundation
was able to furnish us with copies

14:32.722 --> 14:36.685
of President Amunde's
security arrangements.

14:37.143 --> 14:40.689
All right.
Let's get down to it, gentlemen.

14:40.689 --> 14:42.732
Bottom line.

14:42.732 --> 14:47.696
We all know our government's being held
hostage by a no-assassination policy.

14:47.696 --> 14:49.656
We know it's a weak-kneed law

14:49.656 --> 14:53.159
that a bunch of congressional cowards
is not about to change.

14:53.159 --> 14:56.871
Meanwhile, a kingpin of terrorism
gets to walk right into our back yard

14:56.871 --> 15:00.124
and thumb his nose at us,
and I don't like it.

15:00.124 --> 15:01.459
I say we take him.

15:01.459 --> 15:05.463
- You mean sanction him?
- I mean take him.

15:07.006 --> 15:11.135
We take him, and we
shake him until we get the name

15:11.135 --> 15:15.306
and place of every lowlife
in his terrorist network.

15:15.306 --> 15:18.685
And then what do we do
with Amunde? Release him?

15:18.685 --> 15:20.186
Yeah, exactly.

15:20.186 --> 15:23.314
But not until our overseas contacts
have had time to move in

15:23.314 --> 15:25.775
and terminate every fanatic
on his payroll.

15:25.775 --> 15:29.695
That's brilliant. He'll point
his finger at America, at us.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.864
But who cares? Who's gonna believe him?

15:31.864 --> 15:36.327
And the same old nasty rhetoric just
winds up being our best protection.

15:36.327 --> 15:37.829
What about Pete Thornton?

15:37.829 --> 15:41.999
He sets the agenda for field operations,
including Amunde's security.

15:41.999 --> 15:44.126
Funny you should mention that, Reese.

15:44.126 --> 15:49.674
I've been thinking about making serious
changes around the Phoenix Foundation.

15:49.674 --> 15:53.094
What's the status on our climate
prerequisites? They holding?

15:53.094 --> 15:55.554
Delta-T weather conditions holding.

15:55.554 --> 15:58.432
Temperature and barometer readings
still the same.

15:58.432 --> 15:59.767
Good.

15:59.767 --> 16:04.021
And the fuselage is just about
tapped out. Less than 30 litres to go.

16:04.021 --> 16:05.564
Positions, everyone.

16:05.564 --> 16:08.442
Fuel pump shutoff
and line disconnection.

16:08.442 --> 16:11.028
All right, standing by.

16:11.153 --> 16:13.781
Are we at zero volume yet?

16:14.782 --> 16:16.325
Yep.

16:16.325 --> 16:19.036
All 35,000 litres pumped out.

16:19.286 --> 16:21.455
Zero volume is confirmed.

16:21.455 --> 16:24.375
Shut down pump,
prepare for disengagement.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.669
All right, shut down, disengage.

16:26.669 --> 16:28.337
The meters are oscillating!

16:28.337 --> 16:30.506
We've got a charge reading here.

16:30.506 --> 16:33.509
We've got a 25-volt oscillation!

16:34.885 --> 16:36.720
Emergency alert!

16:36.720 --> 16:39.473
Emergency alert! Evacuate area!

16:40.391 --> 16:42.976
Evacuate!

16:45.813 --> 16:47.606
Shut down all systems!

16:47.606 --> 16:49.817
Bring in all backups!

16:49.817 --> 16:54.738
Get the medevac choppers in!
Seal off this area, now!

16:55.072 --> 16:58.116
Emergency alert, emergency alert!

16:58.283 --> 17:01.411
Thermal incident in facility three.

17:01.411 --> 17:04.164
Thermal incident in facility three.

17:04.164 --> 17:07.334
Emergency alert. Emergency alert.

17:07.501 --> 17:08.961
Be careful of the fumes!

17:08.961 --> 17:11.713
Where's that truck?
Get that foam truck in here now!

17:11.713 --> 17:14.590
We're damn lucky
the whole thing didn't go up!

17:14.590 --> 17:16.801
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

17:16.801 --> 17:19.221
Tell 'em to stand by!

17:19.221 --> 17:22.973
He's conscious
and breathing on his own.

17:27.103 --> 17:29.689
Pete?

17:36.529 --> 17:39.115
Get over here!

17:45.872 --> 17:48.500
All right, come on! Come on!

17:49.918 --> 17:52.337
What happened?

17:52.337 --> 17:55.298
What in the hell happened?

18:15.401 --> 18:19.405
Mr Webber, any Intelligence report?

18:19.572 --> 18:24.202
Mr Chairman, it appears
to have been purely an accident.

18:24.202 --> 18:28.998
There's not a whisper
of subversive activity, and...

18:29.457 --> 18:32.418
...it just appears
to have been a technical problem.

18:32.418 --> 18:36.964
Mr Reese, what does
Technical Review have to say?

18:37.090 --> 18:39.592
Our preliminary findings indicate that

18:39.592 --> 18:43.179
the fuel pumping system possibly
gave off an unexpected power surge

18:43.179 --> 18:45.681
at the point of disengagement.

18:45.681 --> 18:49.769
That can only be attributed
to an electrical short in the circuitry.

18:49.769 --> 18:52.563
The spark it emitted
ignited the vapours and...

18:52.563 --> 18:54.023
...she blew.

18:54.023 --> 18:56.317
That's our best assessment
at this point.

18:56.317 --> 19:00.529
Didn't anyone do a pre-run
systems check on the pump?

19:00.529 --> 19:02.448
I did.

19:02.448 --> 19:05.659
But it should have been re-checked.

19:05.826 --> 19:08.412
Gentlemen,
there's only one explanation here.

19:08.412 --> 19:13.292
That's a serious breakdown
in my safety review procedure.

19:13.292 --> 19:15.753
It's my fault.

19:15.753 --> 19:18.714
And I accept full responsibility.

19:19.924 --> 19:24.178
Webber, Reese,
would you excuse us, please?

19:36.065 --> 19:38.359
Peter, this is the
last thing we expected.

19:38.359 --> 19:41.320
Particularly with something
under your supervision.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.614
Yeah, I know.

19:43.614 --> 19:46.366
I'm kind of surprised, myself.

19:47.576 --> 19:50.162
But I missed something, Ed.

19:50.287 --> 19:53.832
I should have backtracked
and backtracked again, and I didn't.

19:53.832 --> 19:56.043
Do you know
how many calls I've received

19:56.043 --> 19:58.504
from the Department of Energy?
The Pentagon?

19:58.504 --> 20:01.131
They want somebody's head.

20:02.424 --> 20:07.054
We both know whose head
that should be, don't we?

20:07.387 --> 20:10.223
I should have listened to you, Ed.

20:10.223 --> 20:12.851
You warned me, didn't you?

20:14.227 --> 20:16.855
And I just ignored you.

20:18.940 --> 20:20.942
Maybe I am burned-out.

20:20.942 --> 20:26.323
Maybe your taking a short leave
of absence might see us through this.

20:26.323 --> 20:28.867
That's not gonna work.

20:28.867 --> 20:31.495
This is too important.

20:31.953 --> 20:36.374
And too many people have worked
too hard to build this Foundation.

20:36.374 --> 20:39.377
No one more than you, my friend.

20:43.924 --> 20:45.717
Webber's ready.

20:45.717 --> 20:50.347
He's a good man.
He can more than fill my shoes.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.224
And he's younger.

20:55.769 --> 20:58.188
You have my resignation, Ed.

20:58.188 --> 21:00.815
Effective immediately.

21:07.697 --> 21:10.909
I can't believe you just took off.

21:10.909 --> 21:12.702
Where you been?

21:12.702 --> 21:14.954
Oh, I just took a long weekend.

21:14.954 --> 21:18.333
Yeah, four days. Thanks for telling me.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.126
Do I have to tell you everything?

21:20.126 --> 21:23.588
If you want your plants watered, yeah.

21:23.713 --> 21:25.548
I did.

21:25.548 --> 21:28.885
- Your landlady let me in.
- Thanks.

21:29.594 --> 21:32.096
I also cleared out all the...

21:32.096 --> 21:36.642
...science projects
you had growing in the fridge.

21:36.726 --> 21:39.312
Now, what's all this bunk
about you retiring?

21:39.312 --> 21:40.980
Well, there's not much to say.

21:40.980 --> 21:43.983
I handed in my resignation.
I've retired, that's all.

21:43.983 --> 21:46.068
You can't, Pete!

21:46.068 --> 21:49.572
You're a type A personality,
it's impossible.

21:49.572 --> 21:53.284
Now just call Farrell.
Tell him you overreacted.

21:53.284 --> 21:55.119
Look, I didn't overreact.

21:55.119 --> 21:59.123
As a result of what I did three people
are dead and eight more in the hospital.

21:59.123 --> 22:02.460
- Pete, it wasn't your fault.
- I don't want to talk about it!

22:02.460 --> 22:06.672
You don't ask for or get a second chance
after something like that.

22:06.672 --> 22:09.300
Forget it.

22:12.178 --> 22:14.805
So, what are you gonna do?

22:15.097 --> 22:19.602
Oh, well, I'm gonna carry on.
What do you think?

22:19.602 --> 22:23.272
I've got plenty to do. I've got
more things than I'll ever get done.

22:23.272 --> 22:24.648
Like what?

22:24.648 --> 22:29.236
Oh, like... write my book.

22:29.403 --> 22:31.780
Work on my boat. Go fishing.

22:31.780 --> 22:34.491
- You hate fishing.
- Camping.

22:34.491 --> 22:37.077
You hate camping.

22:37.244 --> 22:42.249
I want you back, Pete.
It's not the same without you.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.669
Look, MacGyver, times change.

22:46.712 --> 22:49.339
Things change.

22:50.382 --> 22:53.010
It's over for me.

22:55.429 --> 23:00.142
Besides... I'm sure Webber's
gonna do a great job.

23:00.350 --> 23:03.353
Oh, fine. Mr Gung Ho.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.648
What have you got against him?
I recommended him myself.

23:06.648 --> 23:09.276
He's not you.

23:09.276 --> 23:13.989
I like being around a guy
who knows his limitations.

23:13.989 --> 23:17.284
Well, then we
can stop arguing, can't we?

23:17.284 --> 23:20.203
Cos I've certainly learned mine.

23:23.373 --> 23:28.587
Oh, listen, turn in this
security pass for me, will you?

23:30.338 --> 23:35.469
I just didn't want
to go back there again, that's all.

23:35.552 --> 23:38.847
And why don't you go see Webber?
Talk to him.

23:38.847 --> 23:42.017
He's a good man, one of the best.

23:42.809 --> 23:47.188
Do I look like I need a baby-sitter?
Go on, get out of here.

23:47.188 --> 23:49.816
Go on.

24:01.244 --> 24:03.830
See you later.

24:15.383 --> 24:17.427
Would you like a new desk, Mr Webber?

24:17.427 --> 24:20.555
No, no, I'll just use Thornton's.

24:22.974 --> 24:25.059
Look, Nikki,

24:25.059 --> 24:27.854
President Amunde's
special brand of paranoia

24:27.854 --> 24:32.358
is only gonna make
your life miserable. Believe me.

24:32.358 --> 24:36.404
So I'm gonna be the nice guy
that you think I am,

24:36.404 --> 24:38.698
and I'm pulling you off this assignment.

24:38.698 --> 24:42.869
What? No, Matt, don't worry.
I can handle him.

24:42.869 --> 24:45.121
I know that.
It's not a question of that.

24:45.121 --> 24:49.500
It's what else you can handle for me,
as head of the Research Division.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.128
Research?

24:52.628 --> 24:55.298
Oh, MacGyver, how goes it?

24:55.464 --> 24:58.384
That's what I came to find out.

24:58.384 --> 25:01.220
Have you seen Pete? How is he?

25:01.345 --> 25:04.807
Well, he's back.
Give him a call, find out.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.892
I will.

25:06.892 --> 25:14.025
Well, I'm sure you two have things to
talk about. Always a pleasure, MacGyver.

25:14.025 --> 25:17.111
Oh, I hate to have her leave, but...

25:17.111 --> 25:19.655
...I love watching her go.

25:19.655 --> 25:22.450
So, MacGyver,
I guess you want to be filled in.

25:22.450 --> 25:24.744
I got a couple
of environmental projects

25:24.744 --> 25:28.747
that I know that Thornton
would have wanted you to commandeer.

25:28.747 --> 25:30.499
Yeah, maybe later.

25:30.499 --> 25:34.253
Right now what I want to do is my
own review of that defuelling accident.

25:34.253 --> 25:36.589
Why? That's yesterday's newspaper.

25:36.589 --> 25:39.174
I know...

25:39.383 --> 25:40.676
It's personal.

25:40.676 --> 25:42.553
Hey, look, Pete was my friend too.

25:42.553 --> 25:45.598
That's why I don't want to see
this dragged through the mud

25:45.598 --> 25:47.641
any longer than necessary.

25:47.641 --> 25:50.019
I'm gonna miss his baldness around here.

25:50.019 --> 25:52.813
But the bottom line is
he let something get past him.

25:52.813 --> 25:56.900
And it came around
and bit him in the butt.

25:56.984 --> 26:00.279
Look, MacGyver, between you and me...

26:00.279 --> 26:03.323
...I think maybe he
knew it was time to hang it up.

26:03.323 --> 26:06.452
Just as I know this organization
has an agenda to meet

26:06.452 --> 26:09.079
which includes those
environmental projects.

26:09.079 --> 26:13.625
So, what do you say?
Are you in or are you out?

26:14.042 --> 26:18.505
I'm out, Matt.
I got to get some answers first.

26:36.857 --> 26:38.483
Is all our security in place?

26:38.483 --> 26:40.986
Yeah, we've got a lock
on the entire perimeter.

26:40.986 --> 26:44.614
Well, that makes our plan complete then.

26:46.241 --> 26:51.079
Well, looks like we just
became next door neighbours.

26:57.502 --> 26:59.671
President Amunde, welcome.

26:59.671 --> 27:03.758
I'm sure your visit here
will prove to be very rewarding.

27:03.758 --> 27:06.344
Perhaps.

27:09.806 --> 27:12.183
MacGyver! How the heck are you?

27:12.183 --> 27:13.768
I'm good, Sam.

27:13.768 --> 27:17.647
You know, I talked to Pete.
I... I don't like the sound of him.

27:17.647 --> 27:19.107
No, neither do I.

27:19.107 --> 27:22.318
Sick in the heart from watching
the grass grow, if you ask me.

27:22.318 --> 27:26.614
Oh, by the way, Johnson, that tech you
put the fire out on? He's gonna make it.

27:26.614 --> 27:29.450
Oh, that's great. That's good.

27:29.868 --> 27:31.703
Sam, do you mind if I look around?

27:31.703 --> 27:37.667
No, no, I don't mind, but the
Foundation honchos say it's off-limits.

27:37.667 --> 27:39.669
Sam, I want to poke around for Pete.

27:39.669 --> 27:42.588
I think he needs an
independent look at this accident.

27:42.588 --> 27:46.134
Whether he wants it or not.
Yeah, go ahead. What are friends for?

27:46.134 --> 27:48.720
Thanks.

28:00.481 --> 28:02.483
Oh, Miss Carpenter!

28:02.483 --> 28:05.987
Good afternoon, Sam. I just came
to finish my parts inventory.

28:05.987 --> 28:08.573
Sure.

28:09.657 --> 28:12.868
Has he been cleared to be in here?

28:13.202 --> 28:15.288
As far as I know.

28:15.288 --> 28:18.374
Sam, aren't you supposed to know?

28:26.298 --> 28:28.926
New assignment, MacGyver?

28:29.051 --> 28:33.222
- Thought I'd take a look.
- This is my job.

28:33.347 --> 28:37.351
Well, feel free to dig in.
Pete could use all the help he can get.

28:37.351 --> 28:39.728
That is the second time
you have insinuated

28:39.728 --> 28:41.814
that I don't care about Pete Thornton.

28:41.814 --> 28:46.819
You know damn well that I do.
I care a lot, MacGyver.

28:51.490 --> 28:54.118
Hey.

28:54.326 --> 28:56.954
I'm sorry. No harm meant.

29:02.876 --> 29:06.672
So is the Technical Department
gonna reassemble this pump?

29:06.672 --> 29:09.299
That's right.

29:10.717 --> 29:13.595
You know, I just don't get it.

29:13.679 --> 29:16.723
Pete trained these guys to do no wrong.

29:16.723 --> 29:20.394
He went over every piece of this
equipment with a fine-tooth comb.

29:20.394 --> 29:21.812
I watched him.

29:21.812 --> 29:26.108
Well, the answer's
bound to be here someplace.

29:29.736 --> 29:32.072
Yeah.

29:32.072 --> 29:33.699
That's strange.

29:33.699 --> 29:38.578
This assembly shouldn't be
on this side of the pump.

29:39.705 --> 29:43.458
It looks like something's been patched
in here to act as an interceptor

29:43.458 --> 29:47.546
between the pump motor
and the power source.

29:48.255 --> 29:51.383
Whoever put it in here
was counting on it being fried

29:51.383 --> 29:53.426
with the rest of the pump.

29:53.426 --> 29:56.263
I've been over this with Pete.

29:59.474 --> 30:03.436
This is not a part
of the original design.

30:05.355 --> 30:08.358
You know, it's some kind
of an electrical booster.

30:08.358 --> 30:11.319
In the pump assembly? Impossible.

30:11.736 --> 30:13.530
I know.

30:13.530 --> 30:14.989
But here it is.

30:14.989 --> 30:17.617
What are you getting at?

30:17.784 --> 30:21.621
When that fuel pump shut down,
this thing kicked in

30:21.621 --> 30:25.250
and ignited the fumes left in the line.

30:25.416 --> 30:27.418
This is what caused that explosion.

30:27.418 --> 30:30.004
Are you saying that it was sabotage?

30:30.004 --> 30:32.841
It looks like Pete was set up.

30:51.025 --> 30:53.653
- Thanks again, Mrs. Tooley.
- Thank you.

30:53.653 --> 30:56.239
Pete?

30:58.199 --> 30:59.742
Okay, he's not here.

30:59.742 --> 31:03.287
Like I said, he's probably out
enjoying his retirement somewhere.

31:03.287 --> 31:05.915
Yeah, I'm sure.

31:08.501 --> 31:12.588
All right.
Look, I let you have the first move.

31:12.588 --> 31:15.466
He's not here.
Let's go through the proper channels.

31:15.466 --> 31:19.303
No, Nikki, I want Pete
to know about this first.

31:19.303 --> 31:21.681
MacGyver...

31:21.681 --> 31:24.767
...I've already stepped
out of bounds on my case report.

31:24.767 --> 31:28.688
Never mind that you're freelance. I've
got a chain of command to adhere to.

31:28.688 --> 31:31.857
You know, you're sounding
more like a bureaucrat every day.

31:31.857 --> 31:34.652
I am one, damn it, born and bred.

31:34.652 --> 31:36.028
Congratulations.

31:36.028 --> 31:38.614
Look, MacGyver,

31:38.656 --> 31:41.617
I know enough to know
when I'm getting the runaround.

31:41.617 --> 31:43.828
Now why won't
you deal with Matt Webber?

31:43.828 --> 31:47.039
Because I want to protect Pete.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.042
And believe it or not,
I want to protect you.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.335
In case of what?

31:51.335 --> 31:54.171
Well, who's sitting in Pete's chair?

31:54.171 --> 31:56.590
Webber. Who has a better motive?

31:56.590 --> 31:58.300
That is a cheap shot.

31:58.300 --> 32:01.053
Why am I talking to you?
You're dating the guy.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.138
What has that got to do with it?

32:03.138 --> 32:07.101
Have you read the man's dossier?
Have you? You should.

32:07.101 --> 32:11.105
Read about all the special assignments
he did for the DSX: Vietnam,

32:11.105 --> 32:13.982
Nicaragua, the Middle East, Afghanistan.

32:13.982 --> 32:17.653
We're talking about some
pretty nervous situations and places.

32:17.653 --> 32:20.489
The man is capable of anything.

32:20.531 --> 32:22.491
MacGyver...

32:22.491 --> 32:25.244
...you're forcing
a scenario for a motive.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.746
And you sure as hell
haven't given me any proof.

32:27.746 --> 32:30.958
- It's a gut feeling, okay?
- Fine.

32:30.958 --> 32:35.420
You follow your instincts,
and I'll follow mine.

32:36.088 --> 32:38.674
Nikki!

32:54.439 --> 32:57.150
Your Miss Carpenter
is in the station coffee shop.

32:57.150 --> 32:58.401
Who let her through?

32:58.401 --> 33:02.197
She showed her ID and said she needed
to talk to you. Said it was urgent.

33:02.197 --> 33:05.909
You radio your people and tell them
nobody gets into this terminal.

33:05.909 --> 33:09.162
- Are we about ready to go?
- Ten minutes.

33:09.162 --> 33:11.331
Miss Carpenter will take about five.

33:11.331 --> 33:13.959
Security, come in.

33:17.545 --> 33:20.757
I'm sorry, miss, but we're closed.

33:20.882 --> 33:22.926
Matthew.

33:22.926 --> 33:24.803
Listen, I'm sorry I bothered you,

33:24.803 --> 33:27.222
but I wouldn't have
had it not been urgent.

33:27.222 --> 33:28.973
Bother me?

33:28.973 --> 33:33.186
Since when is coming to see me
ever been a bother, Nikki? What's up?

33:33.186 --> 33:38.233
MacGyver and I found evidence
of sabotage at the defuelling station.

33:38.233 --> 33:40.652
This was used to mess up the fuel pump.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.238
I have it all in my report.

33:45.573 --> 33:47.742
MacGyver, huh?

33:47.742 --> 33:50.244
Well, I'm glad you came to me with this.

33:50.244 --> 33:53.331
- You are going to tell him?
- As soon as possible.

33:53.331 --> 33:58.294
If you want to, I will.
God knows he's been through enough.

33:58.294 --> 34:00.463
I'll get to the bottom of this.

34:00.463 --> 34:03.841
I think we should
tell Chairman Farrell right away.

34:03.841 --> 34:10.723
I just get the feeling that you're not
gonna be able to let go of this thing.

34:10.723 --> 34:13.351
Now sit down.

34:20.690 --> 34:23.319
Hey, Sam, I got your message.
I appreciate it.

34:23.319 --> 34:25.947
No problem. He's over there.

34:26.572 --> 34:29.199
Thanks.

34:34.038 --> 34:36.623
Pete?

34:40.335 --> 34:42.963
Pete?

34:44.215 --> 34:46.801
What are you doing here?

34:48.594 --> 34:51.179
I don't know.

34:51.179 --> 34:53.806
Couldn't stay away.

34:53.974 --> 34:56.185
Maybe I'm doing penance for my sins.

34:56.185 --> 34:59.521
You can stop blaming yourself right now.

34:59.521 --> 35:02.024
MacGyver, you don't understand.

35:02.024 --> 35:04.652
Yes, I do, Pete.

35:09.114 --> 35:12.493
That defuelling explosion
was no accident.

35:12.493 --> 35:15.496
It was sabotage, pure and simple.

35:15.621 --> 35:17.581
What? What are you saying?

35:17.581 --> 35:20.584
Somebody planted an electrical charge
in the fuel pump.

35:20.584 --> 35:23.545
I wanted it between us
so we could do an investigation,

35:23.545 --> 35:26.548
but Nikki's taken it to Webber.
I couldn't stop her.

35:26.548 --> 35:30.677
Well, why should you? It's his job.
What are you saying about Webber?

35:30.677 --> 35:34.723
Webber got your job by default.
It's yours to take back if you want it.

35:34.723 --> 35:37.851
MacGyver, you just may have
given me the best news of my life,

35:37.851 --> 35:41.229
but that doesn't mean that I can go
back in there and kick Webber out.

35:41.229 --> 35:44.149
Don't you understand?
There's protocol to follow here.

35:44.149 --> 35:48.153
Listen, if there has been sabotage,
he should investigate it. It's his job.

35:48.153 --> 35:49.363
What is this?

35:49.363 --> 35:53.533
Are you and Nikki collaborating
on the bureaucratic bible or something?

35:53.533 --> 35:57.078
Let me show you what your heir apparent
has been up to since you left.

35:57.078 --> 35:58.413
Oh, MacGyver.

35:58.413 --> 36:02.125
Is it protocol to fire all your
division chiefs in a span of a week?

36:02.125 --> 36:03.418
What?

36:03.418 --> 36:05.629
Is it protocol
to scrap your whole agenda

36:05.629 --> 36:07.964
the day after you leave the Foundation?

36:07.964 --> 36:10.175
The man has hired and fired, Pete.

36:10.175 --> 36:14.763
Dive into the computers.
See what I saw. Come on.

36:16.932 --> 36:19.559
Or have you really retired?

37:02.352 --> 37:05.354
Good evening, Your Excellency,
it's bound and gag time.

37:05.354 --> 37:12.069
Let's show the minister to his new
quarters, shall we? Come on, come on!

37:23.873 --> 37:27.460
Stout effort, gentlemen.
Like clockwork.

37:32.089 --> 37:35.426
I brought us some unexpected company.

37:38.095 --> 37:40.723
Well...

37:41.432 --> 37:44.060
Greetings, Amunde.

37:45.186 --> 37:48.814
Welcome to This Is Your Life.

37:52.276 --> 37:54.612
And you...

37:54.612 --> 37:58.616
You should have
taken that job in Research.

38:03.495 --> 38:07.207
Hacking my way into the Foundation
files, why do I feel like a criminal?

38:07.207 --> 38:09.668
You shouldn't.
I've still got your pass key.

38:09.668 --> 38:13.047
Yeah, the one you were
supposed to turn in for me.

38:13.047 --> 38:15.674
Yeah. That one.

38:17.009 --> 38:19.011
Take a look. The Webber sweep.

38:19.011 --> 38:23.682
I don't believe this.
He fired Renisch? And Hixon?

38:23.849 --> 38:25.851
They've been with me from the start!

38:25.851 --> 38:30.439
And Gelsey, no! These are good men.
Why is he doing this?

38:30.439 --> 38:34.026
Let's take a look at his
operations agenda. Got a password?

38:34.026 --> 38:36.612
Yeah. "Agenda."

38:40.782 --> 38:44.411
- Where do you want to start?
- Amunde.

38:45.954 --> 38:49.207
Wait a minute. Who's this new guy?

38:49.374 --> 38:52.377
I put Nikki in charge
of the security detail.

38:52.377 --> 38:54.588
Wait a minute,
I know some of these names.

38:54.588 --> 38:57.215
These two are from the DSX.

38:57.215 --> 38:59.968
And this one is
from the National Security Agency.

38:59.968 --> 39:03.638
Why do you think Webber's drafting them?

39:06.975 --> 39:10.979
Oh, my God. Amunde's private train!

39:11.146 --> 39:13.648
Right next to a mail car.

39:13.648 --> 39:16.151
MacGyver, these are assault plans.

39:16.151 --> 39:19.529
Exactly the way we drew them up
in the DSX for covert operations.

39:19.529 --> 39:23.825
And Webber drew these up.
Amunde's his target, Pete.

39:23.825 --> 39:26.244
Let's go.

39:26.244 --> 39:31.750
Who handled the consulate bombing?
Who was it? I want names!

39:32.250 --> 39:36.463
No, no, no, no.
I have a much better way.

39:37.547 --> 39:42.010
You may have primitive forms of torture
in your country, Your Excellency,

39:42.010 --> 39:47.015
but we're a little more
sophisticated here in America.

39:51.477 --> 39:54.939
This drug is called "the Converter."

39:55.106 --> 39:56.608
The reason we call it that

39:56.608 --> 40:00.612
is because ten cc's will
make any man pray to God or...

40:00.612 --> 40:05.033
Or Allah, as the case may be,
for relief from the pain.

40:05.033 --> 40:07.368
Twenty cc's,
the agony becomes so intense

40:07.368 --> 40:11.080
that heart attacks
have been known to occur.

40:11.080 --> 40:14.292
And it makes the arteries
in the brain begin to swell,

40:14.292 --> 40:16.627
until you just feel
like you're gonna pop.

40:16.627 --> 40:19.338
Matt, you can't do this.

40:19.505 --> 40:24.510
Oh, yes, Nikki, I can.
That's what this is all about.

40:26.846 --> 40:30.391
The drug takes effect
in just a matter of seconds.

40:30.391 --> 40:32.810
So you tell us what we need to know,

40:32.810 --> 40:38.691
either on your own or with assistance.
The choice is up to you.

40:39.859 --> 40:43.529
You have ten minutes to think it over...

40:46.032 --> 40:50.786
...while I, unfortunately,
deal with another problem.

40:54.999 --> 40:57.626
Sorry, Nikki.

41:11.348 --> 41:13.392
MacGyver was right about you!

41:13.392 --> 41:20.315
Well, if you value his opinion so much,
maybe I can bury you side by side.

41:46.258 --> 41:48.885
Back off, MacGyver.

41:50.095 --> 41:52.681
- Hello, Pete.
- Where's Amunde?

41:52.681 --> 41:55.559
We're questioning him.
You wanted proof, right?

41:55.559 --> 41:59.187
Well, this is gonna be the
biggest score in counterterrorism.

41:59.187 --> 42:02.774
Do you even know what you're doing?
Why, for God's sakes, why?

42:02.774 --> 42:07.112
Why didn't you retire
when you had the chance?

42:09.030 --> 42:11.783
Find Amunde! Webber's mine!

42:11.950 --> 42:14.536
Amunde's in the mail car.

42:40.145 --> 42:42.772
Come here.

42:45.525 --> 42:49.112
When I get on top, wait for my signal.

43:11.676 --> 43:14.971
You've got to run faster than that.

43:16.431 --> 43:20.518
Give it up, Pete.
You've been shuffling papers too long.

43:20.518 --> 43:23.104
Gotten old... and soft.

43:26.858 --> 43:30.528
- Old and soft, huh?
- Yeah, definitely.

44:03.352 --> 44:05.229
Hold it. Now what?

44:05.229 --> 44:08.691
- Hey, what is this?
- Open the door!

44:22.121 --> 44:24.707
Take care of Amunde!

44:47.145 --> 44:51.650
Well, two more
for the unemployment line.

44:55.570 --> 44:59.408
You know, maybe I am
getting too old for this stuff.

44:59.408 --> 45:03.745
Nonsense.
Looks like you just hit your prime.

45:08.792 --> 45:11.420
My tooth is loose!

45:16.216 --> 45:20.971
Am I going to press charges at the
World Court? No, I do not think so.

45:20.971 --> 45:22.556
Let me tell you something.

45:22.556 --> 45:26.017
If I were in the American's position,
I would do the same thing.

45:26.017 --> 45:28.603
But we're talking
kidnapping and assault here.

45:28.603 --> 45:30.647
I love America.

45:30.647 --> 45:34.317
You have such sense
of do-good and conscience.

45:34.317 --> 45:36.945
He didn't even say thanks.

45:37.070 --> 45:41.533
No. Well, at least he got
Webber pegged as his kind of guy.

45:41.533 --> 45:45.870
Matt Webber. I came so close
to falling for his total line.

45:45.870 --> 45:49.833
- I... I'm sorry, Pete.
- Well, don't feel too bad.

45:49.833 --> 45:53.461
- He had us all fooled.
- Excuse me.

45:53.628 --> 45:56.131
- I'll take care of this.
- Yes, ma'am.

45:56.131 --> 45:59.509
I'm going to send this
to Webber at Leavenworth.

45:59.509 --> 46:02.929
He might like to see a familiar face.

46:05.348 --> 46:09.185
Well, Pete, now that you got your old
crew back, what are you gonna do?

46:09.185 --> 46:13.106
Well, I've got Jarvis getting the
disarmament program back on track,

46:13.106 --> 46:15.233
and you're gonna be on that.

46:15.233 --> 46:17.235
And I'm gonna take a little time off.

46:17.235 --> 46:19.195
Time off? You just got back.

46:19.195 --> 46:22.615
This whole experience has taught me
I'm a little bit out of shape.

46:22.615 --> 46:26.411
- No, Pete, you're not out of shape.
- I am, and I'm going back to school.

46:26.411 --> 46:30.081
- School?
- That's right. Karate school.

46:30.206 --> 46:35.795
This is the last time
that anybody decks me with their foot.
