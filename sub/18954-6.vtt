00:32.740 --> 00:36.210
'No-one knows where the soul resides.

00:36.260 --> 00:38.770
'Does it inhabit the heart?

00:38.820 --> 00:41.050
'The brain?

00:41.100 --> 00:43.640
'Where in the body does it hide?

00:44.380 --> 00:49.660
'How is it clothed... and
how might we protect it?

00:52.180 --> 00:54.010
'Exposed to the light,

00:54.060 --> 00:56.660
'the soul seems a fragile thing...

00:57.260 --> 01:00.290
'.. too vulnerable for scrutiny...

01:00.340 --> 01:03.170
'too delicate to live.'

01:03.220 --> 01:06.010
You've stopped fighting the treatment.

01:06.060 --> 01:08.220
I'm too tired.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.620
Sister...

01:29.980 --> 01:33.370
I thought we agreed we weren't
going to do this again?

01:33.420 --> 01:37.660
Come on, let's get you home.

02:25.420 --> 02:27.010
Warqad?

02:27.060 --> 02:28.490
English.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.500
- Post.
- Good.

02:32.460 --> 02:34.500
Post?

02:41.340 --> 02:43.490
Let me stay, please.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.620
I don't have to go back, I
can stay in England with you.

02:51.660 --> 02:55.580
Time to go home to
Somaliland, for the baby.

03:04.260 --> 03:06.850
Ooh!

03:06.900 --> 03:09.450
The baby?

03:09.500 --> 03:11.650
I get help.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.620
Ooh!

03:15.660 --> 03:17.450
Thank you.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.330
Dad, I don't like the look of
this row between the Russians

03:20.380 --> 03:21.770
and the Americans.

03:21.820 --> 03:23.250
Neither do I, son.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.690
Bacon and eggs coming up.

03:24.740 --> 03:26.330
Nothing in front of your mother.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.850
She doesn't need anything
else to worry about.

03:28.900 --> 03:32.570
Ah, thank you! Ooh, it looks delicious.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.690
Be even better with some tomato ketchup.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.250
I'm afraid it's been packed.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.930
We don't move for ten days!

03:37.980 --> 03:40.490
Yes, and there's so much to do!

03:40.540 --> 03:42.690
I've looked out a box for each of you.

03:42.740 --> 03:46.690
Go through your possessions and root
out anything that you no longer use.

03:46.740 --> 03:50.450
I've already filled a box with items
belonging to myself and Angela.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.890
Why do Dad and I have one large box each,

03:52.940 --> 03:55.570
while you and Angela have
one small box between you?

03:55.620 --> 03:58.980
Because Angela and I don't have
a tendency towards hoarding.

04:04.660 --> 04:07.450
Hello, Fred. Found her, then?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.930
No prizes for guessing where.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.370
Is she all right?

04:11.420 --> 04:12.930
A bit chilled.

04:12.980 --> 04:16.220
Let's get you warmed up and
inside with some tea and cake.

04:17.940 --> 04:20.140
I am no Marie Antoinette.

04:21.500 --> 04:25.300
I will not eat cake while my
sister moulders in the asylum.

04:27.140 --> 04:31.460
I will not eat at all until
I am assured she is unharmed.

04:40.220 --> 04:43.490
Whatever the pain was,
it wasn't contractions.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.490
Practice ones maybe.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.290
And you've had nothing since?

04:47.340 --> 04:50.410
Nothing. I am well again,

04:50.460 --> 04:53.250
but perhaps not well
enough to go on a boat.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.970
Who said anything about a boat?

04:55.020 --> 04:58.930
My wife leaves in two weeks, so the
baby can be born in Somaliland.

04:58.980 --> 05:01.610
A fast boat, is it?

05:01.660 --> 05:04.090
I know you think you're only
seven months along, Mrs Farah,

05:04.140 --> 05:07.290
but actually you're more like nine.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.490
This baby is coming any day.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.050
I will be at sea. I leave tomorrow.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.530
- My wife knows no-one here.
- It will be fine.

05:15.580 --> 05:18.850
I have good neighbours
and my sister, Deka.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.810
And now you've got us as well.

05:20.860 --> 05:23.090
You come down to the clinic
with me this afternoon,

05:23.140 --> 05:26.010
we'll do all our checks
and get you booked in.

05:26.060 --> 05:29.700
Don't worry, Mr Farah, your
wife will be in good hands.

05:33.260 --> 05:36.050
'It shall be the policy of this nation

05:36.100 --> 05:39.410
'to regard any nuclear
missile launched from Cuba

05:39.460 --> 05:42.290
'against any nation in
the Western Hemisphere

05:42.340 --> 05:46.690
'as an attack by the Soviet
Union on the United States,

05:46.740 --> 05:49.290
'requiring a full retaliatory response...'

05:49.340 --> 05:51.690
That's quite enough of
that, thank you very much.

05:51.740 --> 05:53.730
You can't turn off President Kennedy!

05:53.780 --> 05:56.050
He's got the future of the
Free World in his hands!

05:56.100 --> 05:58.770
If he was truly concerned about
the future of the Free World,

05:58.820 --> 06:01.090
he wouldn't be making
such inflammatory remarks.

06:01.140 --> 06:05.050
If we're all heading for
oblivion, we need to be prepared.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.690
There you are, Nurse Franklin.

06:06.740 --> 06:08.930
There's a gentleman on the
telephone asking for you,

06:08.980 --> 06:11.570
a Mr Christopher Dockerill?

06:11.620 --> 06:14.450
Thank you, but I can't possibly
speak to him at the moment.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.730
Oh, why's that?

06:15.780 --> 06:18.130
I'm in the middle of an
inventory of the cupboards.

06:18.180 --> 06:20.970
With Armageddon looming, it seems
wise to line-up our supplies.

06:21.020 --> 06:23.820
I'll tell him that you're unavailable.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.250
You, you've brought me
back to the wrong place.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.610
Don't worry, everyone's
always a little bit fuzzy

06:44.660 --> 06:46.330
when they come back from shock treatment.

06:46.380 --> 06:47.930
I was by myself before.

06:47.980 --> 06:50.210
Doctor's transferred
you to a general ward.

06:50.260 --> 06:53.410
No more shock treatment --
thinks you're on the mend!

06:53.460 --> 06:55.850
Will I be discharged
now? Will I be sent home?

06:55.900 --> 06:57.530
One step at a time.

06:57.580 --> 07:01.170
First thing you need is a nap
to shake off that grogginess

07:01.220 --> 07:03.660
and then a nice bath, hm?

07:19.340 --> 07:22.810
Afternoon, Mrs Turner. I'm sorry
I'm late, but this is Mrs Farah.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.450
She's due any day, but
hasn't been to the clinic yet.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.610
Of course.

07:26.660 --> 07:29.130
Let's see if we can jump
you up the queue, Mrs Farah.

07:29.180 --> 07:32.490
It can take a while to get through
everything on a first appointment.

07:32.540 --> 07:33.890
Cubicle two is free.

07:33.940 --> 07:35.650
No, it isn't. Puffy ankles.

07:35.700 --> 07:39.930
- I've just asked Doctor to take a look.
- Cubicle one, then.

07:39.980 --> 07:41.970
Are we collecting for jumble?

07:42.020 --> 07:45.090
I'm having a clear-out in
advance of our house move.

07:45.140 --> 07:47.610
I thought we could make use of
these things in the waiting area.

07:47.660 --> 07:48.850
Oh, yes?

07:48.900 --> 07:51.530
Dr Turner is going to set about
the doll with the Swarfega

07:51.580 --> 07:53.210
when he has a spare moment.

07:53.260 --> 07:56.730
But I thought my old magazines might
provide light relief for our ladies.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.930
They have some very
useful fashion features.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.530
I've never needed an
editorial to instruct me on

08:01.580 --> 08:05.140
how to put myself together, and
I've never had any complaints.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.010
I've come across a few
sailors from Somaliland,

08:10.060 --> 08:11.610
but not many of their wives.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.370
Most prefer to stay in Africa,

08:13.420 --> 08:16.370
but my husband is more
handsome than theirs.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.850
Sorry to interrupt, I've
bought Mrs Farah's notes card.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.490
Lovely, thanks.

08:20.540 --> 08:24.540
Now, Mrs Farah, I'll just
have a little check down below.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.170
I'll be very gentle,

08:27.220 --> 08:29.970
but it will be easier
if you can try to relax.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.960
Easy for her to say.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.049
Is this your first baby?

08:35.100 --> 08:37.500
Yes, I've been married a year.

08:44.140 --> 08:46.300
Can I help, Nurse Dyer?

08:57.620 --> 09:00.450
Mrs Farah, do you mind me asking,

09:00.500 --> 09:04.010
have you had any... surgery down there?

09:04.060 --> 09:06.690
Only what is usual.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.450
Usual?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.370
When I was a child.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.300
It was done to all of us.

09:14.460 --> 09:16.660
Is there something wrong?

09:22.060 --> 09:24.650
There's nothing there but
a scar from front to back.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.090
Are you sure?

09:26.140 --> 09:29.650
Mrs Farah has as much visible
genitalia as that doll.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.730
It's like she's been... sealed up.

09:32.780 --> 09:37.210
But how did she get pregnant? How
does she urinate, menstruate...?

09:37.260 --> 09:40.770
Whoever stitched the
scar left a small hole.

09:40.820 --> 09:44.170
The strangest thing about it
is that she seems to think

09:44.220 --> 09:46.410
the "arrangement" is quite normal.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.490
I can't think of a medical reason for it.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.650
We'll need to refer her to St Cuthbert's.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.050
I should say so.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.810
After seeing her anatomy I can
scarcely imagine how baby got in,

09:55.860 --> 09:58.860
never mind how he's going to get back out.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.340
Thank you.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.090
Excuse me? These aren't my clothes.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.530
I wear a habit, a cap and a veil!

10:16.580 --> 10:18.130
What's the matter now?

10:18.180 --> 10:19.810
I need my own clothes, Nurse.

10:19.860 --> 10:23.530
They're a sign of my commitment
to seek God with my whole being!

10:23.580 --> 10:26.520
- They're a sign of who I am.
- Come on.

10:30.580 --> 10:33.890
I deem it shrewd to be
suspicious of men on the doorstep

10:33.940 --> 10:37.330
who are not the trembling
husbands of expectant wives.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.410
I was hoping to see Nurse Franklin.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.210
We went out for dinner recently,

10:41.260 --> 10:44.530
and I was rather hoping we
might repeat the experience.

10:44.580 --> 10:47.730
You present no credentials.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.090
How can I be confident
your purpose is sincere?

10:51.140 --> 10:53.690
I met Nurse Franklin through
our work at the clinic.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.490
I'm a dentist at St Cuthbert's.

10:55.540 --> 10:58.490
Do you stop the teeth of
your patients with mercury?

10:58.540 --> 11:02.250
I... I use a dental amalgam.

11:02.300 --> 11:06.050
It's basically a blend of
silver, tin, copper and mercury.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.250
And it has people running mad!

11:08.300 --> 11:12.610
Asylums are filled with the
victims of your poison!

11:12.660 --> 11:16.010
Good afternoon. Oh, Mr
Dockerill, how very pleasant.

11:16.060 --> 11:20.340
- May I help you?
- He has designs upon Nurse Franklin.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.010
I'm very glad to hear it.

11:23.060 --> 11:26.370
- Although I'm afraid
she's not at home. - Ah.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.570
Gangway, please, Sister, let
the young man step inside.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.360
And we'll put these flowers in water.

11:41.260 --> 11:43.770
I went and had a rummage
in the laundry room.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.490
Thank you.

11:45.540 --> 11:47.850
Oh, I loved these clothes.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.570
From the minute I put them on
they felt like friends to me.

11:51.620 --> 11:55.610
And when I was ill, I was
a stranger to myself.

11:55.660 --> 11:59.560
Even though I clung to them
there was no comfort there.

12:00.540 --> 12:03.650
I think things might be different now.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.450
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make a fuss.

12:06.500 --> 12:11.290
But all the time I was ill, I
fell short in my commitment to God,

12:11.340 --> 12:15.460
so now that I'm better it's
important that I do things properly.

12:17.020 --> 12:19.970
Why does she sit there?

12:20.020 --> 12:22.290
She's waiting for her son to collect her.

12:22.340 --> 12:25.690
She doesn't remember from one day
to the next that he never turns up.

12:25.740 --> 12:27.850
Lobotomies are like that.

12:27.900 --> 12:29.970
They drill into the brain
to get rid of the illness,

12:30.020 --> 12:32.290
but sometimes there's not a lot left.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.210
I'll pray for her.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.290
How was Mrs Nolan's delivery?

12:42.340 --> 12:43.450
No complications --

12:43.500 --> 12:47.530
another not-so-little boy
weighing nine pounds four.

12:47.580 --> 12:50.120
Ooh, she can certainly grow them.

12:50.820 --> 12:53.170
Oh, you had a gentleman
caller at the door.

12:53.220 --> 12:57.250
It was that rather fetching dentist,
with a bunch of flowers, no less.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.770
Sister Monica Joan had
engaged him in a debate on

12:59.820 --> 13:02.770
the merits and demerits
of mercury fillings.

13:02.820 --> 13:05.570
At least, she was debating,
he just looked scared.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.210
Oh, dear.

13:07.260 --> 13:10.930
I smoothed things over, and we
had quite a pleasant conversation.

13:10.980 --> 13:12.650
In the course of which he revealed

13:12.700 --> 13:14.970
that you'd rebuffed him several times.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.450
A lady doesn't like to look too keen,

13:17.500 --> 13:20.690
especially when the man
drives a sports car.

13:20.740 --> 13:23.010
There's looking too keen, Trixie,

13:23.060 --> 13:26.860
and there's cutting off
your nose to spite your face.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.930
Oh, Phyllis!

13:28.980 --> 13:32.130
I've spent a lot of time
wanting to be with someone,

13:32.180 --> 13:35.770
now I have the opportunity I'm
not sure I have the gumption.

13:35.820 --> 13:40.850
Failure isn't fatal,
but hesitation can be.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.100
Give yourself a chance.

13:44.980 --> 13:46.850
And him.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.770
I put the flowers in the scullery.

13:48.820 --> 13:52.420
A man can look such a fool,
walking away with a bouquet.

14:02.660 --> 14:05.610
Sister, please get back into bed.

14:05.660 --> 14:08.330
I have to say my offices
at a set time every day.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.970
Lauds is meant to be said on waking.

14:10.020 --> 14:11.610
And I'm meant to keep all of you in bed

14:11.660 --> 14:14.610
until I've been round with
the teeth tray and commode.

14:14.660 --> 14:16.530
Thanks. And say one for me.

14:16.580 --> 14:19.570
My Bible's gone! Someone's taken it!

14:19.620 --> 14:22.370
- Things do go missing if you
aren't careful. - I need it.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.730
I need it so that I can
study for my life vows.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.660
If it's gone, it's gone. Come on.

14:42.460 --> 14:46.370
Nurse Franklin, you've got
Mrs Dempsey and Mrs Brackman.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.970
- Nurse Gilbert, Mrs Davies, Mrs...
- Ah, sorry to interrupt.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.290
I spoke to Mr Kenley at St Cuthbert's.

14:52.340 --> 14:55.050
He'll see Mrs Farah
tomorrow at 11 o'clock.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.170
If you could let her know
about the appointment.

14:58.220 --> 15:00.810
And I wondered if one of
you might accompany her

15:00.860 --> 15:02.730
in case there are any issues.

15:02.780 --> 15:04.970
- I can go.
- Thank you.

15:05.020 --> 15:08.570
Did Mr Kenley have any
idea what happened to her?

15:08.620 --> 15:13.290
He thinks it might be something
called pharaonic circumcision,

15:13.340 --> 15:17.530
which includes, amongst other
things, the removal of the clitoris.

15:17.580 --> 15:22.770
Apparently it's a practice common in
parts of Africa and the Middle East.

15:22.820 --> 15:26.530
So why haven't we encountered
it before in our Muslim mothers?

15:26.580 --> 15:29.090
I've not seen it in any
of our Sylheti ladies.

15:29.140 --> 15:31.250
I asked the same question.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.890
Apparently, the practice predates Islam,

15:33.940 --> 15:37.450
and prevalence varies
depending on geography.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.500
I'll leave you to it.

15:40.700 --> 15:44.530
Ooh, makes me shudder
just thinking about it.

15:44.580 --> 15:47.730
How can anyone think removing
genitalia is a good idea?

15:47.780 --> 15:51.450
It's not so long ago that
their removal was practised

15:51.500 --> 15:55.730
in this country. It was deployed
to treat all manner of maladies,

15:55.780 --> 15:58.700
- primarily of the female mind.
- Ugh.

16:01.380 --> 16:04.320
Is anybody going to empty that autoclave?

16:07.860 --> 16:10.450
The morning's post brings good news.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.740
Sister Mary Cynthia has been moved
to a general ward, so we may visit.

16:17.380 --> 16:20.370
You trick me so I will break my fast?

16:20.420 --> 16:22.130
See for yourself.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.780
It's from the Sister at Linchmere.

16:37.340 --> 16:40.010
So how are you doing
getting ready for baby?

16:40.060 --> 16:43.850
I have nappies. A gift from my neighbour.

16:43.900 --> 16:47.330
And Looyaan says he will bring
things after his voyage.

16:47.380 --> 16:51.050
We have a cupboard full of
donated items at Nonnatus House.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.450
I'm sure we can find what
you need in the meantime.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.770
Then all we have to worry about
is keeping that baby inside

16:55.820 --> 16:58.490
till Mr Kenley's had a look at you.

16:59.540 --> 17:02.330
Oi! Out of there, thank you!

17:02.380 --> 17:03.930
I've washed my hands.

17:03.980 --> 17:05.050
Go to school!

17:05.099 --> 17:06.490
I'm going to be a nurse.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.700
- ~
- Go!

17:12.339 --> 17:15.140
Your sister would make a lovely nurse.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.089
So this is normal?

17:18.140 --> 17:20.210
To go to the hospital?

17:21.579 --> 17:24.609
Every case is different.
I'll be there with you.

17:24.660 --> 17:27.260
But I am more different than most?

17:29.460 --> 17:33.490
When it comes to childbirth, every
woman is completely different.

17:33.540 --> 17:37.370
There really is no such thing
as normal or not normal.

17:37.420 --> 17:41.010
Does that make sense? Or
has the sun gone to my head?

17:41.060 --> 17:44.210
There is no sun in England in October.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.580
There you go, then. She
must be talking sense.

17:53.860 --> 17:56.730
Oh, I'm beginning to wonder if this
Cuban crisis will ever be over.

17:56.780 --> 17:59.810
- It does feel never-ending.
- I'm home.

17:59.860 --> 18:01.610
Oh, I was starting to worry.

18:01.660 --> 18:03.610
I walked the long way
back, past the new house.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.330
I didn't know it was
just around the corner

18:05.380 --> 18:06.570
from where Susan Parkin lives.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.450
That's not a name we've heard before.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.090
She goes to St Lawrence's.
She's in my chemistry club.

18:11.140 --> 18:13.570
And soon she'll be at your
bus stop every morning.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.010
- That might cause something
of a "reaction." - Honestly.

18:17.060 --> 18:20.700
I can't even mention a name without
you jumping to conclusions.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.660
This is the ward, Sister.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.570
Oh, you came!

18:36.620 --> 18:38.650
It is you.

18:38.700 --> 18:47.130
Lost to us no longer, but here
before us, perfect and complete.

18:47.180 --> 18:49.290
Well, I'm still in one piece.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.650
I wish we'd found you sooner.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.610
I'm sorry I didn't look harder.

18:54.660 --> 19:00.290
And we will make amends for every
week you've spent away from us,

19:00.340 --> 19:03.410
for every day you spent
beyond the reach of love.

19:03.460 --> 19:06.770
She has never been
beyond the reach of love.

19:06.820 --> 19:10.900
For all love is His, and He is everywhere.

19:15.820 --> 19:19.610
We're going to try to secure your
discharge, but if there's anything

19:19.660 --> 19:24.050
we can do to improve things for
you until then, you must tell us.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.820
There are just so many
patients and so few nurses.

19:29.940 --> 19:32.210
Go on.

19:32.260 --> 19:37.330
Well, it's so full of noise and
chaos that somebody took my Bible,

19:37.380 --> 19:39.530
I didn't even see it go.

19:39.580 --> 19:42.890
That is a-a-an unconscionable act!

19:42.940 --> 19:47.130
I found silence so hard when
I first joined the Order --

19:47.180 --> 19:49.940
I didn't think I could ever crave it.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.780
Port!

19:58.660 --> 20:00.410
Starboard!

20:00.460 --> 20:02.540
Up periscope!

20:04.020 --> 20:05.690
Crow's nest!

20:05.740 --> 20:10.220
Crashing in on my Cubs without
warning. Oh, no, you don't!

20:11.260 --> 20:14.090
We're setting up for a
Civil Defence meeting here.

20:14.140 --> 20:18.090
These boys come to Cubs to learn
useful things by having fun

20:18.140 --> 20:21.250
and that does not include you
scaring the life out of them

20:21.300 --> 20:24.410
with posters illustrating the
perils of the nuclear winter.

20:24.460 --> 20:27.650
- Am I clear? Pack, pack, pack.
- Pack.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.440
Right, lads, let's just wait outside.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.660
Terry!

20:36.740 --> 20:41.330
Linchmere is not an appropriate
environment for Sister Mary Cynthia.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.850
We have to secure her discharge.

20:43.900 --> 20:48.450
Her original detention order
would've expired after 28 days.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.810
Although reactive depression has a
good prognosis in the long term,

20:52.860 --> 20:55.170
it's quite a journey to full recovery.

20:55.220 --> 20:57.330
She will still need care.

20:57.380 --> 21:01.050
Care we can provide at
Nonnatus House, surely?

21:01.100 --> 21:04.090
Would you like me to call the hospital?

21:04.140 --> 21:08.610
I could talk to her psychiatrist
in my capacity as her GP.

21:08.660 --> 21:12.650
I'll come to you if I
may, if I need your help,

21:12.700 --> 21:16.400
but I'd like to do as much
as I possibly can myself.

21:16.700 --> 21:20.770
It's one way of showing her
how much she is valued...

21:20.820 --> 21:23.160
and my way of making amends.

21:25.020 --> 21:28.610
And release the clutch
and pull smoothly away.

21:28.660 --> 21:30.730
That is not the clutch.

21:31.740 --> 21:34.410
You said it was ABC!
Accelerator, brake, clutch!

21:34.460 --> 21:36.930
It is, but in reverse order.

21:36.980 --> 21:40.530
Why does everything about driving
have to be so complicated?!

21:40.580 --> 21:42.770
Right, let's keep it simple.

21:42.820 --> 21:44.210
Emergency stops.

21:44.260 --> 21:46.770
You're going to drive along and
when you're least expecting it,

21:46.820 --> 21:48.210
I will shout "Stop,"

21:48.260 --> 21:51.330
and you will bring the car
to a safe but speedy halt.

21:51.380 --> 21:55.370
- Oh, dear!
- Right.

21:55.420 --> 21:57.210
Find anything suitable?

21:57.260 --> 21:59.810
There's enough in here to keep
baby Farah in matinee jackets

21:59.860 --> 22:01.930
till he starts school.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.300
- I won't ask.
- Best not.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.930
I'm surprised she didn't
pull up a chair beside you.

22:12.980 --> 22:15.250
Actually, I feel much more confident

22:15.300 --> 22:17.890
when she isn't scrutinising my every move.

22:17.940 --> 22:21.060
- I'm sailing along here. - Stop! - Ah!

22:31.020 --> 22:33.570
Scar tissue simply doesn't stretch.

22:33.620 --> 22:38.130
Aside from the need to
widen the exit by cutting,

22:38.180 --> 22:40.570
we'll need to protect the
pelvic floor from damage.

22:40.620 --> 22:44.850
Out of interest, Mrs Farah, did
you suffer from urinary infections

22:44.900 --> 22:47.460
or leakage of stale urine?

22:50.660 --> 22:52.810
I'll speak to a colleague
and get a second opinion,

22:52.860 --> 22:54.690
but we're looking at a hospital delivery

22:54.740 --> 22:56.730
with an elective episiotomy.

22:56.780 --> 23:00.450
Mrs Farah needs to present at
hospital the minute labour starts.

23:00.500 --> 23:04.220
- I'll see she understands.
- Thank you. Goodbye, Mrs Farah.

23:08.060 --> 23:09.540
Well done.

23:10.820 --> 23:13.850
I could murder a hot
sweet tea and a biscuit.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.770
Why don't you take a minute to yourself

23:15.820 --> 23:18.360
and I'll see what I can arrange.

24:02.540 --> 24:05.010
She will find contentment here.

24:08.460 --> 24:11.760
Here you are. You'll
feel better after this...

24:29.700 --> 24:31.740
They never come.

24:36.620 --> 24:40.100
We have a visitor. Come to
take one of our ladies away.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.620
This way, Sister.

24:46.740 --> 24:49.300
That's my Bible, Mrs Archibald.

24:52.940 --> 24:54.810
I want you to have it.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.730
Let it comfort you.

25:13.340 --> 25:15.210
Hello!

25:15.260 --> 25:17.260
Mrs Farah? You there?

25:18.740 --> 25:20.210
Mrs Farah?

25:57.700 --> 26:00.210
In a few days' time, when you feel able,

26:00.260 --> 26:04.170
you may wish to join us in
our devotion, or at mealtimes.

26:04.220 --> 26:08.890
But for now you must rest
and replenish your spirit.

26:08.940 --> 26:12.240
It's replenished already
simply by being here.

26:14.660 --> 26:19.220
Oh, these have seen better days.

26:20.220 --> 26:22.420
I'll get you fresh things.

26:48.860 --> 26:50.370
Everything all right, Deka?

26:50.420 --> 26:53.370
Nadifa sent me out so
she can have some peace.

26:53.420 --> 26:54.810
Well, I could use you.

26:54.860 --> 26:56.650
We've got some things
for baby at Nonnatus,

26:56.700 --> 26:58.330
if you want to come and fetch them.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.290
Then can I see inside your bag?

27:00.340 --> 27:02.610
God loves a trier. Come on.

27:05.860 --> 27:07.970
But that's a special soap.

27:08.020 --> 27:09.770
Are you sure?

27:09.820 --> 27:12.690
I think Sister Mary Cynthia
would be perfectly satisfied

27:12.740 --> 27:14.530
with something simpler.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.050
I want her to have it.

27:16.100 --> 27:19.290
I imagine she had nothing
but carbolic in Linchmere.

27:19.340 --> 27:21.890
I'm sorry not to let you
give it to her yourself.

27:21.940 --> 27:26.090
I'm afraid she needs complete
rest. May I give her your regards?

27:26.140 --> 27:29.820
Of course you may, but I'd
rather you gave her my love.

27:37.060 --> 27:39.400
These are frightening times.

27:44.940 --> 27:47.290
Why do we need to paint our windows?

27:47.340 --> 27:49.450
Well, the idea of the white paint is

27:49.500 --> 27:52.170
it deflects the heat
from the initial blast.

27:52.220 --> 27:55.330
And obviously, you need to
paint them on the outside.

27:55.380 --> 27:58.530
President Kennedy will fix
things before it comes to that.

27:58.580 --> 28:01.810
- He could charm the birds
out of the trees. - Hm.

28:01.860 --> 28:07.530
Unfortunately, Khrushchev
isn't a bird, he's a bear,

28:07.580 --> 28:10.530
and bears don't like to back down.

28:10.580 --> 28:12.530
You really think we need to be worried?

28:12.580 --> 28:14.770
There is cause for concern.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.890
It's not looking good.

28:17.700 --> 28:21.090
It's too horrible to think about,
so you'll forgive me if I don't.

28:21.140 --> 28:23.130
I need to go and do a check on Mrs Greene.

28:23.180 --> 28:25.530
And don't forget, spread the word.

28:25.580 --> 28:28.650
You tell one woman to paint her windows,

28:28.700 --> 28:31.930
she tells five of her pals,
and before you know it,

28:31.980 --> 28:35.460
every family in Poplar is
prepared for a nuclear attack.

28:41.060 --> 28:45.290
This is my Bunsen burner,
essential kit for testing urine.

28:45.340 --> 28:47.450
What might I be testing it for?

28:47.500 --> 28:50.850
- Protein?
- You are a quick study.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.250
I heard we'd acquired a new midwife.

28:53.300 --> 28:56.250
We finalised the selection
of items for Mrs Farah's baby.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.380
Ah, come on, then, gather it
all up. I'll walk you home.

29:00.860 --> 29:03.530
I hope she's not been making
a nuisance of herself.

29:03.580 --> 29:07.010
I rather like her. She reminds
me of myself at her age.

29:07.060 --> 29:10.250
I was desperate for every bit
of medical knowledge going.

29:10.300 --> 29:13.050
I was particularly interested
in venereal disease.

29:13.100 --> 29:16.380
Hm. Useful to know. All set?

29:29.100 --> 29:32.270
We can show your sister
what we've got for baby.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.660
Nadifa.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.570
Oh, no!

29:37.620 --> 29:42.050
Don't push, Nadifa, you mustn't push.

29:42.100 --> 29:43.890
Let me see.

29:43.940 --> 29:46.860
~

29:47.900 --> 29:49.890
Something about a knife.

29:49.940 --> 29:53.100
Can you tell your neighbour
to telephone an ambulance?

29:55.020 --> 29:58.450
Nadifa, I need to take a
look at what's happening.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.250
Can you open your legs for me?

30:00.300 --> 30:03.460
~

30:05.180 --> 30:10.380
Nadifa, I know what's in your
head feels real, but it's a memory.

30:11.780 --> 30:14.490
Look around you -- you're in London.

30:14.540 --> 30:16.810
You're all grown up and
you've got a lovely husband

30:16.860 --> 30:19.490
and you're about to have a lovely baby.

30:19.540 --> 30:23.090
Look at me. Look at me!

30:23.140 --> 30:25.210
I'm going to help you.

30:28.580 --> 30:30.220
No knife.

30:35.420 --> 30:37.340
No knife.

30:39.860 --> 30:41.610
I spoke to your neighbour.

30:41.660 --> 30:44.820
She's going to look after
you, so you're not on your own.

30:50.100 --> 30:54.940
We need to slow baby down, so
pant with me. Pant. Pant. Pant.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.980
That's it, that's it -- keep it up.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.180
Oh, no!

31:05.500 --> 31:07.140
Right.

31:10.340 --> 31:12.340
Pull over right away.

31:13.420 --> 31:16.370
You're doing so well, but I'm
going to level with you, Nadifa.

31:16.420 --> 31:19.530
All the panting in the world isn't
going to stop this baby coming.

31:19.580 --> 31:22.420
Don't push with this contraction.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.100
Keep panting.

31:28.620 --> 31:32.120
Take a breather for a
second before the next one.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.570
On the next contraction,
when I give you the nod,

31:37.620 --> 31:42.490
I want you to push and I'm going to
help baby out, but not with a knife.

31:42.540 --> 31:44.290
- Yes?
- Yes.

31:44.340 --> 31:45.930
There's no way for baby to get out,

31:45.980 --> 31:49.170
so I'm going to make an opening
with my special scissors.

31:49.220 --> 31:51.220
Stay with me, Nadifa.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.690
Contraction coming?

31:55.740 --> 31:58.410
OK. So give me some of that panting.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.850
And a little push.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.660
That's the worst over, Nadifa.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.860
And another push.

32:19.220 --> 32:21.180
Head's born.

32:23.420 --> 32:25.410
Nearly there.

32:37.820 --> 32:39.660
One baby!

32:46.380 --> 32:48.450
Meet your little girl.

33:00.220 --> 33:02.100
Let's go.

33:13.780 --> 33:16.320
I longed for this baby, Patrick.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.140
Longed for it, prayed for it.

33:22.420 --> 33:24.730
And now I'm wondering why
my prayers were answered

33:24.780 --> 33:28.940
because I don't know what sort
of a world we're bringing it into.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.140
And what about Timothy and Angela?

33:34.540 --> 33:39.980
You know, President Kennedy has a
son and a daughter, just like us.

33:41.940 --> 33:46.290
And for all we know, his
wife could be pregnant too.

33:46.340 --> 33:49.090
We just have to hope that
he thinks like a father,

33:49.140 --> 33:51.280
as well as a politician.

33:53.860 --> 33:55.860
We just have to hope.

33:57.460 --> 34:00.000
And we're good at that, Shelagh.

34:06.700 --> 34:10.330
Mrs Farah. Our circumcised
lady. Planned episiotomy,

34:10.380 --> 34:14.010
but the baby was coming so I had
to do it myself in the ambulance.

34:14.060 --> 34:17.260
- She has still torn quite badly.
- Thank you.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.730
Valerie, are you all
right? What's happened?

34:21.780 --> 34:24.050
She was in labour, on her own, for hours.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.889
Was the delivery very bad?

34:25.940 --> 34:28.480
The baby was tearing its way out.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.460
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

34:43.420 --> 34:46.889
I think perhaps it's time to close
those books for the evening.

34:46.940 --> 34:49.650
I have to keep going over things.

34:49.699 --> 34:52.370
As soon as I think I've understood
one element of doctrine,

34:52.420 --> 34:55.330
I-I read a conflicting
account and I'm lost again.

34:55.380 --> 34:57.770
Well, there is such a thing
as being too widely read,

34:57.820 --> 34:59.410
particularly when it comes to some of

34:59.460 --> 35:01.210
the more arcane areas of theology.

35:01.260 --> 35:02.890
No! I have more to do.

35:02.940 --> 35:06.240
And you can do it tomorrow
when you're rested.

35:08.140 --> 35:12.850
Remember, taking your vows isn't
about what's in those books,

35:12.900 --> 35:14.650
it's about what's in your heart.

35:14.700 --> 35:17.130
Your love for God and his for you.

35:17.180 --> 35:21.370
Without that, none of your
studies mean anything at all.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.050
If God loves me, and
He wants me to do this,

35:24.100 --> 35:26.530
why is He making it so hard?

35:26.580 --> 35:29.250
You must sleep.

35:29.300 --> 35:31.770
Sleep.

35:31.820 --> 35:35.320
And in the morning things
will seem much clearer.

36:06.980 --> 36:09.970
I see someone's recovered from her ordeal.

36:10.020 --> 36:11.890
Faduma has.

36:11.940 --> 36:14.610
It might take me a bit longer.

36:14.660 --> 36:17.730
Yes. Give it time.

36:17.780 --> 36:19.370
Thank you.

36:19.420 --> 36:20.970
There's no need to thank me.

36:21.020 --> 36:24.210
I, I was just doing
what I was trained to do.

36:24.260 --> 36:29.260
When I was cut before, they tied
my legs together until I healed.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.810
I was only a child.

36:33.860 --> 36:36.610
Perhaps I was too old when it happened.

36:36.660 --> 36:40.810
My older sister was very young
when it happened to her.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.930
She remembers nothing.

36:44.020 --> 36:47.090
I think perhaps it's better that way.

36:47.140 --> 36:53.090
This is different, Nadifa. Mr Kenley
didn't cut you, he repaired you.

36:53.140 --> 36:57.610
- And nobody here's going to tie
your legs together. - Repaired me?

36:57.660 --> 37:00.690
You were badly torn during
your delivery, Nadifa.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.690
But what has he done?

37:02.740 --> 37:04.650
How has he stitched me?

37:04.700 --> 37:07.240
- I don't know...
- He is a man!

37:08.340 --> 37:10.850
How would he know how I should be sewn?

37:10.900 --> 37:14.060
I'll talk to someone. I'll
see what I can find out.

37:36.580 --> 37:39.980
Your breakfast tray lies
neglected in your room.

37:41.380 --> 37:46.340
The rats may thank you for the
gesture, but your health will not.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.780
I try so hard.

37:53.860 --> 37:57.340
It's as though there's a thick
mist in my brain. I can't study.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.580
I can't even pray.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.810
It's like shouting in whispers,
I'm not sure God can hear me,

38:07.860 --> 38:09.690
and I'm sure I can't hear him.

38:09.740 --> 38:11.770
That is static interference.

38:11.820 --> 38:13.410
It will quiet soon.

38:13.460 --> 38:17.090
No, it's been like this for months,

38:17.140 --> 38:22.090
ever since I became ill. I just
made excuses in the hospital.

38:22.140 --> 38:26.570
I couldn't pray because I didn't
have my Bible, or a chapel,

38:26.620 --> 38:31.340
or silence. And here, I
have all these things.

38:33.460 --> 38:35.400
And there's nothing.

38:38.500 --> 38:42.380
It is no bad thing to be
lost in a fog, all at sea.

38:44.100 --> 38:49.370
When land comes into view again, you
will appreciate it with a keenness

38:49.420 --> 38:53.900
that is denied to those who know
nothing but the safety of the shore.

39:01.620 --> 39:04.610
It's her body, Delia. It's what she knew.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.290
Probably what her husband wanted.

39:06.340 --> 39:08.730
And what about what she wants?

39:08.780 --> 39:11.330
All I can say is,

39:11.380 --> 39:14.010
Mr Kenley said he couldn't
make good a procedure

39:14.060 --> 39:16.410
that never should've been
done in the first place.

39:16.460 --> 39:18.730
And no-one's even told her?

39:20.100 --> 39:21.490
Not yet.

39:21.540 --> 39:23.380
Nurse Busby!

39:36.860 --> 39:39.210
I'm just on my way to a
Civil Defence meeting.

39:39.260 --> 39:40.450
What's the latest?

39:40.500 --> 39:42.090
It's hard to tell with no volume,

39:42.140 --> 39:45.450
but the jist seems to be that if the
USSR doesn't accept Kennedy's deal,

39:45.500 --> 39:49.170
then we're all going
to hell in a hand cart!

39:49.220 --> 39:51.810
I really don't think this is
the time for levity, Barbara.

39:51.860 --> 39:56.620
Sorry. Came out wrong. I think
I'm just trying to be brave.

39:58.340 --> 40:01.620
There's nothing wrong with
that in the middle of all this.

40:04.260 --> 40:05.770
Where are you going, Trixie?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.820
To make a phone call.

40:23.180 --> 40:25.970
May I suggest we spend
the evening in the chapel,

40:26.020 --> 40:30.050
praying for a peaceful
resolution to this conflict.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.840
May I speak to Christopher Dockerill?

40:46.860 --> 40:50.290
Hello. It's Trixie.

40:50.340 --> 40:52.730
I hope you don't think I'm being forward,

40:52.780 --> 40:55.770
but I find myself
unexpectedly free this evening.

Terrible to think this could
all be blown away tomorrow.

41:59.620 --> 42:03.210
You'd think the world
would've learned by now.

42:03.260 --> 42:06.170
We've had two wars already this century.

42:06.220 --> 42:08.330
More than that.

42:08.380 --> 42:12.770
I fought in Korea, thanks
to National Service.

42:12.820 --> 42:16.330
My father never recovered from
the things he saw in battle.

42:16.380 --> 42:19.450
He suffered terrible
shellshock all of his life.

42:19.500 --> 42:22.250
Warfare's bad enough when
you're in the middle of it.

42:22.300 --> 42:25.530
To have to keep replaying
it in your mind...

42:25.580 --> 42:29.130
- Sorry. I'm sounding morbid.
- I don't mind.

42:29.180 --> 42:32.090
No, if the world's about
to be blown to smithereens,

42:32.140 --> 42:33.850
you deserve to be shown a good time.

42:33.900 --> 42:37.370
London is your oyster. You choose.
We can do anything you like.

42:37.420 --> 42:39.820
Dine. Dance. Make merry.

42:41.100 --> 42:46.130
I'd think I'd quite like
to sit here with you...

42:46.180 --> 42:51.140
doing not much at all and
just see what happens.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.940
What if this happens?

43:28.460 --> 43:31.660
Did the electric shock
treatment help at all?

43:32.460 --> 43:34.860
It was... cleansing.

43:36.980 --> 43:39.520
Things were clearer for a while.

43:40.500 --> 43:43.730
I thought I'd carry on getting
better here, and I'm not.

43:43.780 --> 43:47.420
- Failed at Linchmere. Failed here.
- You haven't failed.

43:48.820 --> 43:53.250
You, you're succeeding
just by putting one foot

43:53.300 --> 43:55.730
in front of the other,

43:55.780 --> 44:01.050
carrying on along this
scary, rocky, lonely road.

44:01.100 --> 44:04.860
- It is lonely, Doctor.
It's so, so lonely. - I know.

44:07.260 --> 44:09.930
I was once as lonely as you are now.

44:14.180 --> 44:18.100
It was after the war... and because of it.

44:20.700 --> 44:24.620
But I was sent somewhere where
people walked beside me.

44:25.980 --> 44:28.650
And things got better after that.

44:28.700 --> 44:31.700
Just at this moment, I can't imagine that.

44:32.740 --> 44:34.810
But I want it so much.

44:35.580 --> 44:37.930
And how can I want
something I can't imagine?

44:37.980 --> 44:39.810
It doesn't make sense!

44:39.860 --> 44:42.290
There's just no room in my head for it.

44:42.340 --> 44:44.540
Let me see what I can do.

45:08.700 --> 45:10.810
I wanted to come to your room.

45:10.860 --> 45:13.010
I wanted to talk to you.

45:13.060 --> 45:15.610
I wanted to know that you were all right,

45:15.660 --> 45:18.850
but I couldn't because
of the way things are.

45:18.900 --> 45:22.180
I don't really know how anything
is at the moment, Trixie.

45:23.220 --> 45:25.370
Then I'm just going to say one thing

45:25.420 --> 45:28.890
and you can dismiss it as
platitude if you prefer,

45:28.940 --> 45:33.010
but I generally find that if you can
summon the courage to sit through

45:33.060 --> 45:37.050
the bleakest day, then in the
end, the weather will change.

45:37.100 --> 45:39.410
You just have to hope that when
the sun comes out you aren't

45:39.460 --> 45:43.770
wearing wellington boots
and a sou'wester, because...

45:43.820 --> 45:47.660
there's nothing worse than being
wrongly dressed for an occasion.

45:51.420 --> 45:55.780
Thank you for the soap and
the message you sent with it.

46:10.260 --> 46:11.770
Well done.

46:11.820 --> 46:13.530
You're healing beautifully.

46:13.580 --> 46:15.410
I will never be mended.

46:15.460 --> 46:17.260
What do you mean?

46:19.580 --> 46:22.320
Deka, take the baby to the next room.

46:28.300 --> 46:31.170
The surgeon -- he left me all wrong.

46:31.220 --> 46:34.220
I must be stitched so my husband is happy.

46:36.860 --> 46:39.290
But the damage you have --

46:39.340 --> 46:42.170
it wouldn't have happened if
you hadn't been circumcised.

46:42.220 --> 46:46.020
That was the problem, not
what Mr Kenley did, nor me.

46:46.300 --> 46:49.810
There's lots of things we can
do to help you feel better.

46:49.860 --> 46:53.340
In time, it will become normal.

46:54.780 --> 46:58.620
There is no normal. Not any more.

47:02.780 --> 47:05.890
Mr Spencer's van is looking very full!

47:05.940 --> 47:08.810
Oh, not another box!
Where did that come from?

47:08.860 --> 47:11.060
The cupboard in the eaves.

47:12.060 --> 47:14.690
Angela's baby things.

47:14.740 --> 47:17.650
Her bath. Her cot.

47:17.700 --> 47:19.530
I asked you to get rid of all this

47:19.580 --> 47:22.450
when we thought our family was complete.

47:23.060 --> 47:25.610
Maybe I never gave up hope.

47:25.660 --> 47:29.260
Just as I haven't that the
Russians will back down.

47:31.180 --> 47:33.770
I've checked every other
room. They're all empty.

47:33.820 --> 47:37.370
- We're not leaving anything behind.
- Thank you, Timothy.

47:37.420 --> 47:40.460
I'll tell Mr Spencer there's one more box.

47:47.140 --> 47:49.940
- Lots of memories.
- Yes.

47:51.100 --> 47:53.690
They don't belong to the house.

47:53.740 --> 47:55.330
They're ours.

47:55.380 --> 47:57.500
They come with us.

48:14.220 --> 48:16.810
There's something about hovering
on the brink of a nuclear war

48:16.860 --> 48:18.490
that rather blunts the appetite.

48:18.540 --> 48:20.170
Honestly, I'd tuck in.

48:20.220 --> 48:22.650
If Khrushchev gets his way,
the only vegetables we'll see

48:22.700 --> 48:25.210
for a long time will be out of a tin.

48:25.260 --> 48:28.530
- Mrs Whitten. - Breech?
- No. Baby turned.

48:28.580 --> 48:31.370
So you never told us about your date!

48:31.420 --> 48:33.490
A lady never tells.

48:33.540 --> 48:35.130
But since you ask.

48:35.180 --> 48:37.570
I thought if we're all
going to die anyway,

48:37.620 --> 48:40.160
I might as well let him kiss me.

48:40.700 --> 48:42.490
Evening, all.

48:42.540 --> 48:43.810
Mr Buckle.

48:43.860 --> 48:46.610
- Is there news from Cuba?
- The best news.

48:46.660 --> 48:49.450
The Russians have agreed America's terms.

48:49.500 --> 48:51.450
Kennedy has stood down his weapons.

48:51.500 --> 48:54.380
- It's over?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

48:57.220 --> 48:58.850
We live to see another day.

48:58.900 --> 49:00.650
Is it on the radio?

49:00.700 --> 49:03.010
I want to hear this for myself.

49:03.060 --> 49:05.170
What a relief! I'm so very happy.

49:05.220 --> 49:07.730
Still glad you let your dentist kiss you?

49:07.780 --> 49:09.170
Win-win, I say.

49:09.220 --> 49:11.610
We did not pray in vain.

49:11.660 --> 49:13.850
You certainly did not.

49:13.900 --> 49:17.820
And now we're off a war footing,
we can resume your driving lessons.

49:25.340 --> 49:27.930
Did you speak to someone?
What's the hold up?

49:27.980 --> 49:31.330
Mr Spencer misread the address
you wrote down for him.

49:31.380 --> 49:35.290
The van and all our worldly
possessions have gone to Kent!

49:35.340 --> 49:38.450
And they say it's doctors
who have poor handwriting.

49:38.500 --> 49:41.930
Patrick, I feel like an absolute fool.

49:41.980 --> 49:43.610
Then we're a fine pair.

49:43.660 --> 49:45.530
While I was at the phone box,

49:45.580 --> 49:49.410
I also rang the Electricity Board
to ask why we've not been connected.

49:49.460 --> 49:52.810
It transpires I gave them
the wrong connection date.

49:52.860 --> 49:56.180
We have no electricity
until tomorrow afternoon.

50:04.900 --> 50:08.290
Dr Turner has recommended
a hospital near Birmingham.

50:08.340 --> 50:11.250
It's called Northfield.

50:11.300 --> 50:14.690
It's a very gentle, therapeutic community.

50:14.740 --> 50:17.130
Not at all like Linchmere.

50:17.180 --> 50:20.540
- Is that where he went?
- Many years ago, yes.

50:22.380 --> 50:25.610
- Can I ask you for one
more kindness? - Anything.

50:25.660 --> 50:27.290
Could you contact the Mother House

50:27.340 --> 50:30.450
and ask them to send
me my postulant's dress?

50:30.500 --> 50:33.940
- Your postulant's dress?
- I left Nonnatus House in it before.

50:34.940 --> 50:37.250
I want to leave in it again

50:37.300 --> 50:44.330
because once, then, I knew
who I was, where I was going,

50:44.380 --> 50:47.130
what there was at the end of the road.

50:47.180 --> 50:50.120
And now I don't know any of those things.

50:52.380 --> 50:55.480
I want to go right back
to the beginning...

50:56.580 --> 51:01.460
.. to where I was when everything
was clean, nothing was impossible.

51:03.900 --> 51:06.730
And that means wearing
my postulant's dress.

51:06.780 --> 51:09.180
I think that's very sensible.

51:18.220 --> 51:20.050
Goodness.

51:20.100 --> 51:24.130
A Melton Mowbray pork
pie and a vanilla slice.

51:24.180 --> 51:26.090
You certainly do know how to treat a girl.

51:26.140 --> 51:28.650
Yes, I decided to push the boat out.

51:28.700 --> 51:32.740
But I do have something that might
be a little more to your taste.

51:34.380 --> 51:37.770
I thought we should have something
special to toast the new peace.

51:37.820 --> 51:39.770
Gosh!

51:39.820 --> 51:41.560
Something wrong?

51:42.300 --> 51:44.130
Not at all.

51:44.180 --> 51:47.130
Only I'm on call tonight and
we're not allowed to imbibe.

51:47.180 --> 51:50.090
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't think.
- Don't worry.

51:50.140 --> 51:54.770
I'll simply hold it up in an
elegant way and pretend. Like so.

51:54.820 --> 51:57.820
Well, you really do look rather wonderful.

51:58.700 --> 52:00.660
Chin-chin!

52:05.980 --> 52:09.130
It was very good of Nurse Crane to
lend us the Cubs' sleeping bags.

52:09.180 --> 52:10.810
I keep finding things in mine.

52:10.860 --> 52:14.130
- I think there's a woggle
at the bottom. - Lucky you.

52:14.180 --> 52:17.450
The only thing in mine
is the faint aroma of wee.

52:17.500 --> 52:20.610
It reminds me of when we went
camping. Best holiday ever.

52:20.660 --> 52:24.570
Oh, don't. Keep our voices
down or we'll wake Angela.

52:24.620 --> 52:27.810
We're very lucky though, aren't we?

52:27.860 --> 52:30.300
Yes. Yes, we are.

52:38.460 --> 52:40.660
Ready?

53:51.540 --> 53:54.740
- Baby's doing extremely well.
- And so is Mum.

53:55.900 --> 53:58.930
This was donated to the
toy box at the clinic,

53:58.980 --> 54:01.250
but I thought Deka might make use of it,

54:01.300 --> 54:03.730
given her interest in all things medical.

54:03.780 --> 54:07.050
Deka is not here. She's leaving
on the boat with a chaperone.

54:07.100 --> 54:09.090
She's going back to Somaliland?

54:09.140 --> 54:11.690
Deka didn't say anything about leaving.

54:11.740 --> 54:15.170
She didn't know. None of us
did. My mother decided it.

54:15.220 --> 54:18.660
There was a ticket.
And... And it was time.

54:21.100 --> 54:23.100
She's gone to be cut.

54:27.220 --> 54:28.890
How could you?

54:30.020 --> 54:31.130
How could you let her go

54:31.180 --> 54:33.570
when you could've died
from what they did to you?!

54:33.620 --> 54:35.970
You're going to live with the
damage for the rest of your life.

54:36.020 --> 54:37.730
Do you really want the same for Deka?

54:37.780 --> 54:43.770
Do you really want some man to pin
her down and cut and sew her closed?

54:43.820 --> 54:47.130
Is that what you want, Mrs Farah?

54:47.180 --> 54:50.810
My name is not Mrs Farah.

54:50.860 --> 54:54.170
In my country, a woman does
not take her husband's name --

54:54.220 --> 54:57.860
she is her own person called
after her own family line.

54:59.020 --> 55:03.170
My name is Nadifa Ghedi Jama.

55:03.220 --> 55:06.330
And no man would dare
cut me or my sisters --

55:06.380 --> 55:10.530
the person who holds a knife is a woman!

55:10.580 --> 55:13.850
The person who calls Deka
back to be cut is a woman!

55:13.900 --> 55:18.530
Her own mother who loves her,
who wants her to be respected,

55:18.580 --> 55:20.770
to be clean, and to find a good husband.

55:20.820 --> 55:23.020
And to be those things...

55:25.340 --> 55:27.700
.. she must be cut.

55:29.340 --> 55:32.500
She will not be scared.
She is braver than me.

55:47.420 --> 55:50.970
'Deka was escorted back to her homeland

55:51.020 --> 55:54.490
'where her family were
waiting and she was cut,

55:54.540 --> 55:57.620
'like generations of women before her.'

56:01.460 --> 56:03.780
See you after my holiday!

56:09.660 --> 56:11.170
Dr Turner!

56:11.220 --> 56:13.250
I hoped we'd see you.

56:13.300 --> 56:17.130
I'm Nurse Barrington, but
everyone calls me Barry.

56:17.180 --> 56:20.290
What would you like to be
called while you're with us?

56:20.340 --> 56:24.180
If you don't mind, and if
I'm allowed to choose...

56:25.260 --> 56:30.180
.. I'd just like to be called
by my name, which is Cynthia.

56:34.820 --> 56:40.980
'There are so many secret wounds,
so many types of hidden scar.

56:42.740 --> 56:46.370
'Nadifa, in time, decided
that her own little girl

56:46.420 --> 56:49.210
'would not be circumcised.

56:49.260 --> 56:51.930
'It was a bold step and it took courage...

56:51.980 --> 56:54.120
'like every new journey.

56:55.780 --> 57:02.810
'The soul, being stronger than we
think, can survive all mutilations

57:02.860 --> 57:07.700
'and the marks upon it make
it perfect and complete.'

57:13.700 --> 57:15.850
They can give her
artificial legs, already?

57:15.900 --> 57:18.610
Roehampton's working with a
number of Thalidomide children.

57:18.660 --> 57:20.050
Just tell them, "Yes."

57:20.100 --> 57:21.730
This isn't funny, Valerie!

57:21.780 --> 57:23.930
Christopher's obviously
involved with someone else!

57:23.980 --> 57:25.570
And I don't want 'em taking her anywhere

57:25.620 --> 57:27.770
where they think she's a
freak that needs fixing!

57:27.820 --> 57:29.850
If we don't let them try and mend her,

57:29.900 --> 57:31.810
then her life's over before it's begun!

57:31.860 --> 57:33.930
Nurse Crane should stand down from duties

57:33.980 --> 57:35.690
until the situation is resolved.

57:35.740 --> 57:38.210
If you caused harm to someone else...

57:38.260 --> 57:40.130
would it not make you question everything

57:40.180 --> 57:42.020
your life has come to stand for?
