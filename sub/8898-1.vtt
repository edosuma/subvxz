Tragic and ironic.

I'm talking to ghosts

15:31.463 --> 15:32.942

SANDRA: Oh, my.
Do you think that's it?

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:58.715
PERRY: So, why are we here?

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.989
Someone has got to
talk to her, Dad.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:07.432
Yeah. Why is that
person you, exactly?

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:18.834
(GASPS)

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:24.077
Oh, my goodness.
Look out!

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:25.813
Mom!
(SCREAMS)

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:27.353
Perry! Do something!

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:29.116
I am trying!

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.919
Kick it in the knothole!

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:35.328
Norman?

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:39.590
I'm okay, Mom!

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:41.896
Just wait for me here.
Don't worry.

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:43.937
Be careful!

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:04.851
(GASPS)

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:19.231
Uh...

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:21.297
Hello?

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:23.672
AGGIE:
<i>You're not welcome here.</i>

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:26.102
<i>Go away.</i>

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:31.579
I really need to
speak with you.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.745
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:37.018
I'm Norman. Norman Babcock.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:41.585
You don't actually
know me, but I know you.

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:44.290
We're actually kind
of the same, you and I.

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:45.354
<i>You're not dead.</i>

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:49.164
Well, no, apart from that.

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:51.431
<i>And you're a boy.</i>

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:53.769
Well, yes. That, too.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.334
<i>You're not like me at all!</i>

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.676
Well, I know how you feel.

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:03.614
<i>No, you don't. You don't
know anything about me.</i>

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.846
I know your name is
Agatha Prenderghast.

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:06.943
<i>What?</i>

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:10.047
And I know you're
probably tired, right?

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:12.718
Because, I mean,
it's really late,

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:15.387
and it's been a long night,

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:18.625
and we're, like,
only 11 years old, and...

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:22.658
<i>I don't want to go to sleep,
and you can't make me.</i>

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:26.662
(SCREAMING)

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.276
(GRUNTING)

01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:00.703
I burned the book into dust.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:04.508
Now I don't have to listen
to that stupid story any more!

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.620
Leave me alone.

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:19.482
No. No, I'm not leaving.

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:21.858
Just listen to me.

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:24.225
Once upon a time,

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:27.392
long ago,
there was a little girl.

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:28.491
What?

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:31.595
A little girl
who was different...

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.072
Who was different from the
other people in her village.

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:36.506
I'm not listening!

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:40.911
She could see and do things
that no one could understand,

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.846
and that made
them scared of her.

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:44.475
I don't like this story!

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.317
She turned away from everyone,
and became sad and lonely,

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.221
and had no one to turn to!

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.281
Stop it!

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:11.272
But the more she
turned away from people,

01:16:11.633 --> 01:16:13.544
the more scared
they were of her,

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:15.479
and they did
something terrible!

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.182
They became so scared

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.311
that they took her away
and they killed her!

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.615
No!

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:24.554
But even though she was dead,
something in her came back.

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:25.683
Stop!

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:28.751
And this part of her, it wouldn't go away.
Not for 300 years!

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:29.818
Shut up!

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:32.729
And the longer it stayed, the less
there was of the little girl.

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:34.165
(SHRIEKING)

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.310
I'll make you suffer!

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:47.779
Why?

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.751
Because... Because...

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:55.846
Because you want everyone to
hurt just as much as you are.

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:58.983
So, whenever you wake up,
you play this mean game,

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:01.288
but you don't play fair!

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:06.256
They hurt me.

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:08.130
So, you hurt them back?

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.898
I wanted everyone to see
how rotten they were.

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:14.665
You're just like them, Agatha.

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.232
No, I'm not!

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.299
You're a bully!

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:19.505
No, I'm not!

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:21.839
Ahh!

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:48.266
They did something awful,

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.810
but that doesn't
mean you should, too.

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:53.107
All that's left in you now
is mean and horrible!

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:54.408
That's not true!

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:57.541
Then stop! This is wrong
and you know it!

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:59.676
You spent so long
remembering the bad people

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.517
that you've forgotten
the good ones.

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:05.114
There must have been somebody who
loved you and cared for you.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.318
You don't remember them?

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:07.621
Leave me alone!

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:10.357
But you're not alone!
You have to remember!

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:11.727
Keep away from me!

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:12.822
Remember!

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:39.519
Aggie.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:42.953
My name was Aggie.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:51.904
I remember,

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:54.464
my mommy
brought me here once.

01:18:57.199 --> 01:19:01.875
We sat under the tree
and she told me stories.

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:03.746
They all had
happy endings.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.813
And then those horrible men
came and took me away,

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:10.754
and I never
saw her again!

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:12.348
(GASPS)

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:15.621
(SOBS)

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:21.363
Sometimes when
people get scared,

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.903
they say and do
terrible things.

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:26.864
I think you
got so scared

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:28.930
that you forgot
who you are.

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:34.877
But I don't think you're a witch.
Not really.

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:37.006
You don't?

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:41.244
I think you're just a little
kid with a really special gift

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:43.949
who only ever wanted
people to understand her.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.560
So, we're not all
that different at all.

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:51.931
But what about
the people who hurt you?

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:54.695
Don't you ever want
to make them suffer?

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:59.629
Well, yeah, but what
good would that do?

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:02.771
You think just because
there's bad people out there,

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:05.334
that there's no
good ones either?

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:08.644
I thought the same
thing for a while,

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:11.809
but there's always someone
out there for you,

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:14.015
somewhere.

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:22.522
I just want my mommy.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.393
I'm sorry, Aggie.

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:27.733
She's gone.

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:34.437
That story you were telling,
how does it end?

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:38.343
I think that's up to you.

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.814
Is this where
they buried me?

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.489
It's a pretty
good place to sleep.

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:58.964
Then you can be
with your mom again.

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:05.598
(SIGHS)

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:24.616
Sleep tight.

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:26.846
Norman?

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.819
Norman!

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.857
My brave little man!

01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:34.086
I thought I was going to lose you.
(KISSING)

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:36.390
Mom! You're embarrassing me.

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:38.431
That's my job.
COURTNEY: Psst.

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:40.791
Good job, Norman.

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:43.768
Well done, son.
You did it.

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:58.076
So, are we going
to need statements?

01:22:58.173 --> 01:23:00.517
No!
Ow! That was my fingernail.

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:04.547
You know what it's like. You join a
mob and you say things. (CHUCKLES)

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:07.456
I was merely
inhabiting the role.

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:10.655
Yeah, it was the others.
They pushed me into it.

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:13.427
Yeah, me and Norman are in
a lot of the same classes.

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.661
We're pretty much
inseparable best buds,

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:18.898
and we do a lot of psychic
investigations together.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.668
We have a blog, actually.
You should check it out.

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:24.904
So, I was thinking maybe we
could catch a movie sometime.

01:23:24.966 --> 01:23:26.411
Nothing scary.

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.675
That sounds great, Kathy.

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:31.240
You know, you're going
to love my boyfriend.

01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:33.843
He's, like,
a total chick-flick nut!

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.787
Hey, Neil.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.490
You did it! You stopped
the witch's curse,

01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:49.194
and made the zombies go away and
saved pretty much everything!

01:23:49.257 --> 01:23:50.429
I guess.

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:52.938
I just wanted
to say thanks.

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:55.440
You stood by me,
all the time.

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:58.671
Yeah, of course!
Don't get weird or anything.

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:02.305
So, do you think now everything
is going to turn back to normal?

01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:05.045
Well, as normal
as it could be.

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:07.113
(SCREAMS)
Oh!

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:08.245

What are you watching?

Right.
Of course she is.

Is she, uh... Is she, uh,

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.444
sitting next to me?
