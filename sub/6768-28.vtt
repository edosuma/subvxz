WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:04.421
<i>Please, anything but</i>

00:04.504 --> 00:05.547
a love story.

00:05.630 --> 00:06.923
Steve, Kel's getting
the "Movie" section.

00:07.006 --> 00:07.924
{\an3}We'll see what's
playing.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.426
{\an1}Hey, boys.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.302
Val, you want
to go see a movie?

00:11.386 --> 00:13.263
{\an3}Uh, no, actually-- I'm gonna
go to David's house.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.305
{\an3}I think we're
housebound tonight.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.598
{\an3}But thanks,
I appreciate it.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.766
Ooh, domestic bliss.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.934
Our Valerie.
Who'd have thought?

00:18.017 --> 00:19.144
David is a brave boy.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.980
{\an4}You guys run a paper,
and you didn't have
one in the house.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.022
We're a weekly.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.566
The <i> Tribune</i> has
a daily movie section.

00:24.649 --> 00:25.692
And breaking stories.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.445
But you beat them with this one.
Councilman Macknamee.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.779
You met with him, didn't you?

00:29.863 --> 00:31.364
Let me see that.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.618
He cheated on his wife
with that?

00:35.702 --> 00:36.619
{\an3}What's this
guy thinking?

00:36.703 --> 00:37.620
Any insight?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.581
{\an5}None to speak of.
Well, Bran
did have a tip,

00:39.664 --> 00:40.999
but he opted not
to run the story.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.584
Why?

00:42.667 --> 00:44.419
Journalistic integrity.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.296
{\an1}Her firm won
city contracts.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.756
Don't you think maybe
their affair

00:47.839 --> 00:49.174
{\an1}had something
to do with that?

00:49.257 --> 00:51.968
Her firm had been doing contract
city work for years.

00:52.051 --> 00:52.927
It was all aboveboard.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.764
Except Macknamee was cheating
on his wife.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.557
You do think
that's wrong, don't you?

00:57.640 --> 00:59.601
We've covered this ad nauseam
at this point and time,

00:59.684 --> 01:00.810
don't you think, Kel?

01:00.894 --> 01:04.438
The <i> Tribune</i> devoted, what,
ten column inches?

01:04.522 --> 01:05.482
{\an1}How many words
is that?

01:05.565 --> 01:07.484
Steve?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.652
750,

01:09.736 --> 01:11.529
more or less.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.616
By comparison, I was brief.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.621
(phone rings)

01:19.704 --> 01:20.997
Hello?

01:21.080 --> 01:23.374
Hi, I'm trying to reach
Valerie Malone, please.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.417
Oh, this is Valerie.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.170
Hi, Valerie, I'm Tom Stahl
with the Red Cross.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.380
Your name was on a national
donor's list for bone marrow.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.382
A list for what?

01:31.466 --> 01:35.595
Your bone marrow was typed
in 1992 at Buffalo General.

01:35.678 --> 01:37.847
Do I have
the right Valerie Malone?

01:37.931 --> 01:40.016
Oh, right, yeah, a neighbor
of ours was sick.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.644
Um, she had some type of cancer
or something.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.187
Leukemia?

01:44.270 --> 01:46.481
Yeah, my whole family got
tested, but nobody matched.

01:46.564 --> 01:47.357
Well, you are a match

01:47.440 --> 01:48.983
for a patient who does need
a donation

01:49.067 --> 01:50.193
at this time.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.070
Mm, I-I don't know.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.655
Look, why don't we set up
an appointment?

01:53.738 --> 01:55.698
You come in, meet with a
counselor who'll tell you

01:55.782 --> 01:56.574
all about the procedure.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.618
Listen, I was a kid
when I got typed.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.245
I didn't even know
what I was doing.

02:00.328 --> 02:03.540
Valerie, what happened to your
neighbor who was sick?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.459
She, uh, she died.

02:07.585 --> 02:14.384
Yeah, I guess I could come down
and talk to the counselor.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.395
(singing quietly)

02:26.938 --> 02:28.064
{\an3}That's a gun.
Ow!

02:28.147 --> 02:30.358
Don't turn around,
and you might live.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.943
{\an3}I want you to punch
in your limit

02:32.026 --> 02:33.570
{\an3}and pray it's high.
Okay.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.821
{\an3}Hurry up!

02:36.948 --> 02:38.741
{\an3}Look, I swear to God,
I will blow a hole

02:38.825 --> 02:40.535
{\an3}the size of your head
through your gut.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.953
Now punch in your code.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.289
I can't think, okay?
Come on!

02:44.372 --> 02:48.543
{\an3}Okay, okay, all right,
hit a thousand.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.255
{\an1}I can't, it's too high.
There's a limit!

02:52.338 --> 02:54.132
{\an6}Well, then 800 then!
Six-- whatever!
Just hurry up!

02:56.342 --> 02:58.595
(labored breathing)

03:00.638 --> 03:02.765
Okay, here, here, here.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.436
{\an3}All right, give me
your wallet, your wallet.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.521
Fine.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.440
Now I want you
to count to 50.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.443
{\an3}I might be gone in three,
but if I'm not,

03:13.526 --> 03:16.446
{\an3}and you turn around,
I'll kill you.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.240
One, two, three, four,

03:19.324 --> 03:20.283
I don't hear you!

03:20.366 --> 03:23.411
{\an1}(louder):
...five, six, seven,

03:23.494 --> 03:26.205
eight, nine, ten...

03:27.040 --> 03:29.500

03:56.027 --> 03:57.528

04:21.928 --> 04:23.805

04:47.829 --> 04:50.039

05:10.310 --> 05:11.853
You know, those ATMs have
monitors, don't they?

05:11.936 --> 05:13.396
{\an1}VALERIE: The cops said
it was smashed.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.857
{\an3}The guy probably shot it out
before you got there.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.525
Did you get a look at him?

05:17.608 --> 05:19.068
No.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.111
His height,
tattoos, anything?

05:20.194 --> 05:22.530
{\an4}Nothing.
The guy stuck the gun
right in his ribs.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.032
You should see his bruise.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.533
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.951
{\an3}Uh, I got to get
to the studio.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.411
Hey, this one's on me.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.080
{\an3}David, was your new address
in your wallet?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.248
Yeah.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.375
{\an6}Well, you should probably
change your locks.
Yeah.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.793
{\an1}Maybe you should get
an alarm system.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.086
You need a gun.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.964
No.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.591
{\an4}Thanks.
BRANDON: A gun?
What, do you

05:41.674 --> 05:43.593
{\an6}have a gun?
Yeah, I've got one
on the boat

05:43.676 --> 05:45.636
{\an1}and I've got one under
the register at the bar.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.721
What? Since when?

05:46.804 --> 05:48.556
Since always.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.099
It's no big deal.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.060
{\an3}It's probably not a bad idea,
living in the marina.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.478
{\an5}Anybody could get
in there.
I don't know.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.437
It just doesn't
seem like you.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.772
{\an1}Ah, you know what?
I gotta get

05:55.855 --> 05:57.273
{\an3}to the paper.
We're hiring an assistant.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.399
{\an1}I struck Steve
with the first interview.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.943
{\an1}Dave, if you need anything,
give me a call, will you?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.445
{\an1}Yeah, did I mention
I'm fine?

06:02.528 --> 06:04.781
Uh, ten times.
Glad to hear it.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.116
(both chuckle)

06:07.200 --> 06:09.577
{\an1}I've got a meeting
with a source tonight,

06:09.660 --> 06:11.412
{\an1}so I won't be home
until late.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.498
{\an3}Again? Following a story
you won't print?

06:13.581 --> 06:14.791
{\an1}(chuckles)

06:14.874 --> 06:16.459
{\an1}Remind me how much
you worship me

06:16.542 --> 06:18.294
{\an1}and you can't bear
a minute without me.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.003
{\an3}Something exactly
like that.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.339
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.638
<i>So, it's just a small incision</i>

06:28.721 --> 06:29.639
they make in your back,

06:29.722 --> 06:30.640
{\an3}and they'll withdraw
the marrow,

06:30.723 --> 06:31.808
{\an3}which is
essentially blood,

06:31.891 --> 06:33.518
{\an3}out of the core
of the bone.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.645
I know
I'll be under anesthesia,

06:35.728 --> 06:36.979
but afterwards,
is it gonna hurt?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.689
There'll be some discomfort
for a few weeks,

06:38.773 --> 06:39.941
but you won't be immobilized,

06:40.024 --> 06:41.609
and you should be out
of the hospital

06:41.692 --> 06:43.277
the same day.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.656
So, for one day of my life,
I'll be saving somebody else's.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.783
Leukemia's
a very serious disease.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.993
And I can't promise you
the patient will survive

06:51.077 --> 06:52.203
even with your donation,

06:52.286 --> 06:53.955
{\an3}but it is their
best chance.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.499
Did anybody else match
this patient's type?

06:56.582 --> 06:57.625
No, not yet.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.503
I'd really like
to think about it.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.296
But there's not a lot of time
for indecision.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.881
I understand.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.134
Here's a pamphlet
that explains everything.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.554
If you are interested,

07:09.637 --> 07:11.472
{\an3}we'll have one more
counseling session together,

07:11.556 --> 07:13.641
and then, after that,
we'll need your final decision.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.393
Okay.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.523
{\an1}Hey.
Hey.

07:20.606 --> 07:21.524
How'd it go?

07:21.607 --> 07:23.359
Oh, it-it was intense.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.236
What's this?

07:25.319 --> 07:28.156
{\an3}Uh, it's a pamphlet
on the procedure.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.367
{\an1}Hmm, "Now that
you're a perfect match..."

07:31.450 --> 07:33.327
{\an3}Excuse me.
That pamphlet...

07:33.411 --> 07:34.745
{\an1}Yeah?

07:34.829 --> 07:36.414
{\an3}I'm sorry,
it's just...

07:36.497 --> 07:37.999
{\an3}Well, are you donating
bone marrow?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.376
{\an1}Um, I'm not sure.
Why?

07:40.459 --> 07:42.378
Well, my father's here.

07:42.461 --> 07:44.172
He's being treated for
complications of leukemia,

07:44.255 --> 07:46.549
and he's the only one
on the ward with it.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.010
Well, a nurse told me that
we may have found a match.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.553
MAN: Judy, he's
asking for you.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.556
{\an1}Oh, this is my brother Mark.
I'm Judy.

07:53.639 --> 07:56.559
{\an3}I'm... David.
This is Valerie.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.519
She's a match for Dad.
Valerie...?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.021
Malone.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.731
Are you sure about this?

08:01.814 --> 08:04.025
{\an1}How many other donors
do you see here?

08:05.484 --> 08:07.403
Mark, isn't this amazing?

08:07.486 --> 08:08.571
How does this work?

08:08.654 --> 08:10.031
{\an3}Did they fly you
in or what?

08:10.114 --> 08:11.240
No, actually,
I live here.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.200
Are you a student?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.451
No, I run a club

08:13.534 --> 08:14.660
{\an1}in Beverly Hills--
the After Dark.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.913
{\an3}We should leave
these people alone.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.414
{\an1}Oh, I didn't mean
to push.

08:18.497 --> 08:21.542
{\an1}No, I wish all the best
for your Dad.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.921
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Schreiber, Pediatric ICU.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.589
Dr. Cissy Schreiber
to Pediatric ICU.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.133
Did you see how
happy she was?

08:29.217 --> 08:33.929
{\an1}Yep. She thinks
you're gonna do it.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.722
I am.

08:42.395 --> 08:43.731
Can you type?

08:43.813 --> 08:45.441
No, but I've talked
on the phone.

08:45.524 --> 08:46.400
Really? Professionally?

08:46.484 --> 08:47.944
I'm trying to get out

08:48.027 --> 08:49.946
of that 900 business.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.030
(laughs)

08:52.531 --> 08:54.450
Thank you for coming.
Very nice to meet you.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.534
We'll be in touch.

08:56.535 --> 09:00.790
Did the ad specify assistant
or spokesmodel?

09:00.873 --> 09:02.124
(phone rings)

09:02.208 --> 09:03.918
Don't worry,
we'll find somebody.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.336
You guys start this one
without me, okay?

09:05.419 --> 09:07.421
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.173
{\an1}<i>Beverly Beat.</i>
Uh-huh.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.466
Janet, think quick.

09:10.549 --> 09:13.135
{\an3}(laughs)
Oh!

09:13.219 --> 09:15.429
{\an1}Hi, I'm, uh,
Sarah Edmunds.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.931
I think I'm early.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.766
Oh, well, promptness is

09:18.849 --> 09:21.477
{\an6}always rewarded.
I'm Janet Sosna
and this is...

09:21.560 --> 09:22.645
{\an6}BRANDON:
What do you think
of my editorial?

09:22.728 --> 09:23.896
{\an3}Steve?

09:26.565 --> 09:29.026
I can't...

09:29.110 --> 09:31.696
Uh, just a minute.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.656
{\an4}BRANDON:
Tomorrow maybe?
Yeah, yeah. No, no,

09:33.739 --> 09:35.324
I already got a lead on that.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.492
{\an1}Yeah, right,
thanks for calling. Bye.

09:36.575 --> 09:38.160
{\an3}Do you want to take
this interview?

09:38.244 --> 09:39.495
No, I want to go home.

09:39.578 --> 09:40.663
{\an3}Come on. You're
gonna abandon me?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.498
{\an1}Yeah, I'm
gonna leave early.

09:42.581 --> 09:43.499
{\an1}I was here every night
last week late.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.001
{\an1}My source bailed on me.
I gotta go.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.168
I'll see you later.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.628
Great.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.171
{\an6}See ya, Janet.
Good luck, ladies.
Bye.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.715
{\an3}Hi, I'm Steve Sanders.
I'm the publisher.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.551
Uh, nice work with the ball.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.470
I'm Sarah Edmunds.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.348
{\an1}Sarah's the office manager
at <i> Empire</i> magazine.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.850
{\an3}She's incredibly
qualified

10:00.933 --> 10:02.143
{\an1}for the assistant
position.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.519
Overqualified even.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.479
Well, I wouldn't say that.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.149
Modesty--
it's a virtue.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.401
{\an3}So, um,

10:10.484 --> 10:12.486
Steve, is there anything

10:12.570 --> 10:15.323
that you want
to ask Sarah?

10:16.741 --> 10:20.620
No, um, we'll call you.
I'll let you know.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.872
All right, thank you. Bye.

10:24.665 --> 10:25.958
She's not gonna work out.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.710
{\an1}Are you kidding?
She's perfect.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.462
{\an3}(quietly):
I can't work with her.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.553
What's going on?!

10:37.636 --> 10:38.721
{\an1}I was gonna tell you
about it.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.390
Gwynneth Adair,
my girlfriend.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.727
{\an1}Donna-- he can't shut up
about you.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.562
{\an1}I've known Noah
a long time.

10:46.645 --> 10:48.022
She was the girl next door.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.732
{\an1}We met at the
Albright party in,

10:49.815 --> 10:51.233
what, second grade?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.068
Third, you loser!

10:52.151 --> 10:53.652
I lost track of him

10:53.736 --> 10:55.696
{\an1}when he went to Hawaii.
Do you live in L.A.?

10:55.780 --> 10:56.906
San Francisco.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.741
{\an1}I do marketing
for a software company.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.910
{\an1}I was on the plane
to L.A. for business

11:00.993 --> 11:04.413
{\an1}when I nearly flipped past
the article!

11:04.497 --> 11:05.706
All right, go easy with

11:05.790 --> 11:06.707
the article, okay?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.209
So how was the flight?

11:08.292 --> 11:10.294
{\an3}You still
hyperventilating?

11:10.378 --> 11:11.545
Mm, afraid of flying?

11:11.629 --> 11:14.632
Heights-- this one's
a real panic monster.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.592
{\an1}I chicken out
on one Ferris wheel ride,

11:16.675 --> 11:18.761
{\an1}and my
reputation's ruined.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.930
But I swore I'd do it
by the time I was 21.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.598
{\an1}And you said
you were gonna do it with me.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.810
{\an1}Your promise is
two years overdue.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.770
{\an5}You're staying
a few days, right?
Mm-hmm.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.939
{\an5}We'll, uh, try
to squeeze you
in one night.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.565
{\an1}Well, when's
a good night for you?

11:31.649 --> 11:34.402
Oh, no, I couldn't intrude.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.612
But I am a strong believer
in keeping promises.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.072
Me, too.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.743
(phone ringing)

11:43.744 --> 11:45.371
<i>Beverly Beat.</i>

11:45.454 --> 11:46.455
Hey, Janet, is Brandon there?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.790
Oh, hi.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.458
Um, no.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.127
His source bailed,
so he split early.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.586
Well, that's weird.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.963
I just tried him at home.

11:54.046 --> 11:54.922
Well, I'm-I'm gonna head out.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.966
Um, do you want me
to leave him a message?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.300
No, no.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.635
I'd rather you didn't.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.636
Thanks.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.096
{\an3}Hey.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.431
{\an1}Hi. I didn't know
you're here.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.433
{\an3}Yeah. Noah has a friend
in from out of town

12:05.516 --> 12:06.475
{\an3}that's staying
on his boat.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.602
{\an3}Some girl that he
grew up with.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.438
{\an3}He's known her since
she was seven or eight.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.480
{\an3}She's like a kid
sister to him.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.441
How old is she now?

12:13.524 --> 12:15.109
She's 23.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.611
But I like her,
and I trust him.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.864
{\an3}Sorry. You know what?
Just ignore me.

12:19.947 --> 12:23.492
{\an3}I... I just called Brandon,
and he wasn't there.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.869
So?

12:24.952 --> 12:26.871
So he said that he was
gonna be working late,

12:26.954 --> 12:28.414
and Janet said that
he left hours ago.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.499
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.793
I wouldn't either.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.503
{\an3}If he hadn't
cheated on me.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.302
(rock music playing)

12:44.263 --> 12:45.681
Hi. Uh, we met today.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.349
{\an3}Yeah, at the
hospital, right?

12:47.433 --> 12:48.476
{\an3}Uh, Mark.
(chuckles)

12:48.559 --> 12:50.811
{\an1}It's supposed to be anonymous,
you know, the donation.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.439
Look, I'm really glad we met.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.565
I know it's only one day,

12:54.648 --> 12:56.734
but it's a lot for me
to go through for a stranger.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.527
I'm not here to push you.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.196
I know.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.031
Meeting you
and your sister today,

13:02.114 --> 13:04.492
{\an3}I... I saw the people
I'd be helping.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.703
God, I-I'd really like
to meet your dad.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.205
I was only there
to support Judy.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.749
He molested my sisters,

13:11.832 --> 13:14.210
{\an1}repeatedly,
when we were kids.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.378
Our oldest sister Martha,
she cut all ties.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.506
{\an1}Judy claims she's past it
and he's changed...

13:18.589 --> 13:19.507
Um, I really

13:19.590 --> 13:20.382
can't hear this.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.594
{\an1}He stopped when he couldn't
overpower her.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.429
He hasn't changed.

13:25.513 --> 13:29.058
{\an1}He's a predator;
that's his nature.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.311
{\an1}That's the life
you'll be saving.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.355
I'd let him die.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.162
Hey, guys.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.413
Who's Brandon with?

13:51.497 --> 13:54.416
Oh, he's doing
an interview.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.085
Did you, uh,
bring your resume?

13:56.168 --> 13:57.086
Here it is.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.046
Ah.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.881
Thanks, thanks.
We'll be in touch.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.259
{\an1}Thank you.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.969
Hey.
Hey.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.472
{\an1}How you doing?
Good.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.559
Steve, why did she give
me a modeling head shot?

14:11.642 --> 14:14.270
Yeah, exactly where are
you finding these girls?

14:14.353 --> 14:16.564
{\an3}STEVE: We had two responses
to the classified ad.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.608
So I called a buddy of mine
who owns a modeling agency.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.151
{\an1}BRANDON: Steve, we need
someone who can

14:21.235 --> 14:23.320
{\an3}act like an assistant,
not pose as one.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.488
Okay.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.615
{\an1}Next time
I'll call a talent agency.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.658
{\an3}(groans)

14:27.741 --> 14:29.493
Steve,

14:29.577 --> 14:31.078
{\an1}it's not okay
for you to lure women

14:31.161 --> 14:32.454
{\an1}with job prospects.
Yeah.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.123
How else am I
supposed to meet women?

14:34.206 --> 14:35.457
{\an3}Wait a minute,
you made a promise

14:35.541 --> 14:36.750
not to date anyone
else you work with.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.586
Remember that, big guy?

14:38.669 --> 14:41.714
Okay, if I find someone I like,
I won't hire them.

14:41.797 --> 14:42.840
(laughs)

14:42.923 --> 14:43.716
{\an1}Yes.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.926
Was he dropped on
his head as a kid?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.469
{\an3}I think so.
Repeatedly.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.470
{\an1}How'd your meeting go
last night?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.972
Oh, it got canceled.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.640
He works at a water
treatment facility.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.976
{\an3}I'm not even sure
there's a story there.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.144
Well, you should've called.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.313
{\an5}(phone ringing)
Yeah, I was tired
when I got home.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.689
{\an3}I ran some errands,
went to the gym,

14:58.772 --> 14:59.690
went to see David.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.025
Oh, yeah? How is he?

15:01.108 --> 15:02.151
He's, uh, holding up.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.569
<i>Beverly Beat.</i>

15:03.652 --> 15:05.613
Uh, Brandon,
it's someone from

15:05.696 --> 15:07.489
the Department of Water
and Power.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.325
{\an1}Go, go.
I have to make a call.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.784
{\an3}All right.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.496
{\an3}Uh-huh.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.498
{\an3}Hey, what's going
on, bud?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.500
{\an3}(Brandon continues
indistinctly)

15:18.584 --> 15:19.418
{\an3}Yuh-huh.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.712
(phone ringing)

15:21.795 --> 15:22.713
Hello.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.632
David, hey, it's Kelly.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.674
I was just calling to...

15:25.758 --> 15:26.842
See how I'm doing.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.469
I'm fine.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.596
Told Brandon the same thing
last night when he stopped by.

15:30.679 --> 15:31.805
He did?

15:31.889 --> 15:32.806
Oh, good.

15:32.890 --> 15:33.849
(chuckles)

15:33.932 --> 15:35.267
Try not to sound so relieved.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.561
I wish I could.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.564
VALERIE: <i> I was wondering</i>
<i>about the recipient.</i>

15:40.648 --> 15:42.191
{\an3}The donation's
anonymous.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.485
{\an3}Did you make it over to the
lab for the blood work today?

15:44.568 --> 15:45.569
They were all backed up.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.570
{\an3}Oh, I can

15:46.654 --> 15:47.404
tell them you're in a rush.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.531
Well, I'll do it later,

15:49.615 --> 15:51.367
{\an1}sometime this week.
I wouldn't wait too long.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.870
Um, the patient,
uh, how sick is he?

15:54.953 --> 15:57.831
I really can't tell you
anything more than this.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.583
He needs your help.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.126
"He." So it is a guy.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.173
{\an3}This is an "intent
to donate" form.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.883
{\an3}Now, once you sign this,
you're legally bound

16:07.966 --> 16:09.885
to the procedure.

16:09.968 --> 16:11.220
Sounds serious.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.389
Once you commit,
the patient undergoes

16:13.472 --> 16:15.557
extensive chemotherapy
to prepare for the transfer.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.143
What they do is they
essentially kill off

16:18.227 --> 16:20.020
all of his own marrow.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.523
Without your transfusion,
he or she will die.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.234
You know,
if you're worried about

16:25.317 --> 16:27.611
the risks of the procedure,
we could go over them again.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.571
No.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.656
I know the risks.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.451
All of them.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.500
{\an3}It's the BMW of
stopping machines.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.921
{\an3}It's a small bullet,
but it makes a big hole.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.592
In high school, a friend of mine
put a gun to his chest

16:50.676 --> 16:52.052
and made a mess
of his dad's study,

16:52.136 --> 16:53.429
so you can save
the efficiency pitch.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.973
I'll take it.

16:59.685 --> 17:00.728
{\an1}(scoffs)

17:01.854 --> 17:03.731
What's all this?

17:03.814 --> 17:05.733
If everything clears,
you'll have the gun in 11 days.

17:05.816 --> 17:06.942
11 days?

17:07.025 --> 17:08.318
I can't sleep.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.444
What am I supposed
to do until then?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.612
That's the law.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.407
(sighs)

17:14.491 --> 17:16.827
{\an3}Now, we'd like you to wait
about ten or 15 minutes

17:16.910 --> 17:17.994
after giving
blood, okay?

17:18.078 --> 17:20.289
Okay, thank you.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.124
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Rachel Jeneau,

17:22.207 --> 17:23.416
please report to Pathology.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.586
Excuse me. Miss Malone?

17:27.045 --> 17:28.005
You got a blood test.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.423
Uh, are you going to do it?

17:29.506 --> 17:32.426
Look, I-I really
can't talk right now.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.554
Mark told me
that he came by to see you.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.932
I know that he told you.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.979
I wasn't a match,
but if I was, I would help him.

17:44.062 --> 17:45.105
Why?

17:46.565 --> 17:47.483
He hurt you.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.442
{\an1}BOY:
Mommy!

17:48.525 --> 17:49.359
Grandpa says

17:49.443 --> 17:50.903
he's tired!

17:51.904 --> 17:53.447
Henry's six,

17:53.530 --> 17:54.907
Ellen's eight.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.744
That's my father.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.663
{\an3}It's taken
a long time

18:01.747 --> 18:05.209
and a lot of therapy,
but I realized

18:05.292 --> 18:08.212
that... I don't want
to lose him.

18:09.546 --> 18:10.547
And your father?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.132
{\an1}Has he gone through
therapy, too?

18:12.216 --> 18:14.510
Look, your daughter
is eight years old.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.553
I was 11 when my father
molested me.

18:25.687 --> 18:26.980
(sighs)

18:27.064 --> 18:28.565
"No, I don't want
to read Tolstoy.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.566
I'm sorry."

18:29.650 --> 18:31.360
{\an3}(laughs)
Okay, here we go.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.277
Here's my interview notes.

18:32.361 --> 18:36.698
We've got three resumes,
seven head shots.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.034
{\an1}Yes.
Way to go, Steve.

18:39.117 --> 18:41.537
{\an1}Let's just vote, you guys.
Sarah Edmunds.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.538
Who's your second choice?

18:42.621 --> 18:44.915
Sarah Edmunds--
she's also my first and third.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.626
{\an1}What-what's your problem
with her?

18:49.628 --> 18:50.671
(sighs)

18:50.754 --> 18:53.507
{\an1}Oh, no.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.591
You liked her.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.719
I didn't even talk to her.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.637
Because you were tongue-tied.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.222
Because you wanted
to go out with her.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.557
Mm-hmm. You're good.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.058
He's not exactly complex.

19:03.141 --> 19:04.560
{\an1}(groans)
Copy that.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.020
Hire her, okay?

19:07.104 --> 19:09.523
Well, if we don't,
it's because you like her,

19:09.606 --> 19:11.024
{\an1}and that would be
discriminatory.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.568
But if we do,

19:12.651 --> 19:16.071
{\an1}you will find some way
to entice her, alienate her

19:16.154 --> 19:18.448
and generally ruin the workplace
environment for us all.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.702
{\an1}Yeah, Steve, it's time
for you to take a vow, okay?

19:21.785 --> 19:24.580
Be a professional, keep your
pants on and your trap shut.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.665
Can you handle that?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.961
I'll try.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.422
NOAH:
<i>And one for you.</i>

19:33.505 --> 19:34.423
Thank you, sir.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.549
You're welcome.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.550
And one for you.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.553
{\an1}So, who's running the famous
After Dark tonight?

19:39.636 --> 19:41.430
My manager Valerie.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.806
{\an1}GWYNNETH:
Hmm.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.933
{\an3}Also his
ex-girlfriend.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.602
Ooh.
(laughs)

19:46.685 --> 19:48.770
{\an1}DONNA:
So have you guys ever...?

19:48.854 --> 19:50.439
Oh, me and Noah?

19:50.522 --> 19:52.357
{\an1}Mm.
No, no way.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.109
Not this one.
She's a real heartbreaker.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.235
Really?

19:55.319 --> 19:56.445
That true?

19:56.528 --> 19:59.323
I realize I don't love someone,
I do the honorable thing.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.908
Yeah, she dumps them.

20:00.991 --> 20:01.950
(laughter)

20:02.034 --> 20:03.577
All of them.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.455
{\an3}Wait, so you've
never been in love?

20:06.538 --> 20:07.998
(splash)
Ooh.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.125
{\an1}Oh, sorry.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.050
Maybe once or twice.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.471
I'm exhausted.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.639
I had a fun time tonight.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.265
Thanks, guys.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.433
{\an3}NOAH: Don't forget
about tomorrow night.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.477
Ferris wheel.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.479
I remember everything.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.940
Night.

20:33.023 --> 20:33.649
{\an1}Night.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.611
{\an3}Mm... I hope
you're staying.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.488
You have company.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.490
{\an3}NOAH:
You're staying.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.824
{\an1}Yeah, but if
we're both here,

20:42.908 --> 20:44.993
{\an1}she might feel like
she's intruding.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.119
{\an3}(moans)

20:46.203 --> 20:47.371
{\an3}Gwynneth's a good
friend of mine.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.872
She's happy for me.
Mm-hmm.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.666
Mm!

20:55.045 --> 20:57.673
KELLY:
<i>Did you hire an assistant?</i>

20:57.756 --> 20:58.840
{\an1}BRANDON:
Sarah.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.467
{\an1}Janet's gonna call her
in the morning.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.553
{\an1}It was after 7:00
before we decided on her.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.558
You've been working late
this week.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.644
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.528
What are you doing?

21:26.743 --> 21:27.828
I don't trust you.

21:27.911 --> 21:31.665
I don't know how
else to say it.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.710
I was, um...

21:34.793 --> 21:36.545
looking at a receipt
in your pocket.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.588
What exactly
were you expecting to find?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.841
(sighs)

21:40.924 --> 21:42.509
Proof that you were
at a restaurant tonight

21:42.592 --> 21:43.510
and not at work.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.762
{\an3}Anything

21:45.846 --> 21:49.516
so that I'm not crazy
for doubting you.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.852
I gotta tell ya, I'm really
getting tired of this.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.228
So am I, Brandon.

21:53.311 --> 21:55.313
Do you think I like
feeling like this?

21:56.648 --> 21:59.026
Every time I call you
and you're not there,

21:59.109 --> 22:00.277
every time the phone rings

22:00.360 --> 22:02.571
and it's a hang up,
every time I see you

22:02.654 --> 22:04.406
talking to a woman, I think,

22:04.489 --> 22:06.199
"Is that her?
Is that the next Emma?"

22:06.283 --> 22:08.285
If you want to end this,
Kelly, do it.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.412
Don't chip away at it
till there's nothing left.

22:10.495 --> 22:14.166
Brandon, I want you.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.626
But I don't want
to feel like this anymore.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.341
There is no one else.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.346
I want to believe you.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.685
I'll never leave you.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.565
Marry me.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.489
Yes.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.584
DONNA:
<i>You're getting married?</i>

22:57.667 --> 22:58.627
{\an3}Oh, my God!

22:58.710 --> 23:00.587
{\an3}Wait, wait, wait, wait,
when did this happen?

23:00.670 --> 23:02.798
{\an6}Tell me what he said,
what'd you say?
Tell me everything.

23:02.881 --> 23:03.840
Of course she said yes.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.300
{\an1}You guys are
perfect together.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.843
We've been through a lot.
You're getting married.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.595
Last night we were
practically breaking up.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.639
{\an3}Well, finally, some
interesting news.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.641
Well, it all just came out--

23:12.724 --> 23:14.476
the jealousy, the insecurity.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.104
{\an3}At first he was really
frustrated but then he was

23:17.187 --> 23:18.939
so reassuring and sweet.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.107
And then?

23:20.190 --> 23:22.192
And then he said...

23:22.275 --> 23:23.193
{\an1}Marry me.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.236
Well, then what?

23:24.319 --> 23:26.488
I mean, what do you say
once you become engaged?

23:26.571 --> 23:28.406
{\an3}Well, there wasn't much
talk after that.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.700
Wait, she said yes
or was it more like,

23:30.784 --> 23:32.869
(passionately):
"Yes, yes!"

23:32.953 --> 23:35.122
Yes! Of course I will be
the best maid of honor

23:35.205 --> 23:36.456
you will ever have.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.458
The only, I hope.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.168
Okay, let's recap.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.629
{\an3}You've traded in your
entire future to have sex

23:42.712 --> 23:45.298
{\an3}instead of an argument
you couldn't win.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.312
Do you mind?

23:59.396 --> 24:00.689
Take your time.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.402
Could you back up, please?

24:05.485 --> 24:07.821
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.406
Back the hell away from me!

24:09.489 --> 24:12.033
All right, geez.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.001
{\an3}Sarah, hi.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.878
Let me go, I'll call you back.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.921
{\an3}SARAH:
Hi. Um...

24:25.005 --> 24:26.464
I-I thought about your offer,

24:26.548 --> 24:28.717
and, uh, I can't take the job.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.594
I just wanted to

24:30.677 --> 24:31.511
tell you in person.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.848
Is there anything we can
do to change your mind?

24:34.931 --> 24:38.560
Uh, no, but, um...

24:39.519 --> 24:42.355
...thank you.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.321
She hates me.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.741
I don't know what I did.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.085
There's no line.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.545
I made a reservation.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.049
Come on, I'll hold your hand.

25:10.508 --> 25:12.093
{\an1}Come on.

25:16.514 --> 25:19.309
Here we are.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.394
Don't forget, stop at the top.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.442
(festive music plays)

25:27.525 --> 25:29.611
(motor whirring)

25:39.329 --> 25:41.248
(motor stops, music stops)

25:44.584 --> 25:46.586
(metal creaking)

25:46.670 --> 25:49.631
{\an1}You okay?

25:49.714 --> 25:52.467
Uh-huh.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.636
{\an3}So, do you see
much of your family?

25:54.719 --> 25:55.887
Nope.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.472
{\an3}Well, I'm in San
Francisco now.

25:57.555 --> 25:59.307
It's safe to call or visit.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.309
Unless you wanted to
leave me behind too.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.520
No, I'm glad to see you.

26:03.603 --> 26:07.023
{\an3}So, what about the
other promise?

26:07.107 --> 26:09.484
At 21, regardless...?

26:09.567 --> 26:11.361
{\an1}No, your cousin's
wedding, right?

26:11.444 --> 26:12.612
We saw them kissing.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.197
You were disgusted by it.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.782
You wanted to try it.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.326
{\an1}Well, yeah, it seemed to hold
a lot of merit back then.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.995
It worked for your cousin.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.497
And you refused me.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.415
But we swore.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.542
{\an3}No matter where we were,
or who we were with,

26:25.625 --> 26:27.836
{\an3}when I turned 21,
we'd kiss.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.964
{\an5}That was a kid's prom--
Check it out, see
if we were destined.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.799
{\an1}That was a kid's
promise, okay?

26:32.882 --> 26:35.802
{\an3}Oh, come on, like one little
kiss is gonna kill you?

26:42.392 --> 26:46.187
{\an1}No, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.523
{\an1}You know I'm with
Donna, right?

26:48.606 --> 26:50.859
{\an3}I know.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.278
{\an1}All right.

26:55.947 --> 26:59.492
(motor whirrs,
festive music resumes)

27:05.957 --> 27:08.043
{\an1}Hi.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.879
Hi! What are you doing?

27:10.962 --> 27:12.922
{\an1}Oh, the washer is
broken at my apartment,

27:13.006 --> 27:14.716
so I'm just doing
a little laundry.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.676
Is that okay?
Yeah, absolutely.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.970
{\an3}You know, I've got
some upstairs

27:19.054 --> 27:21.389
{\an3}and since we're getting
married, you know...

27:21.473 --> 27:24.559
That sounds weird, doesn't it?

27:24.642 --> 27:26.478
{\an1}I can't believe you
got the nerve to ask me.

27:26.561 --> 27:28.146
I wasn't even thinking.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.900
You didn't think it through?

27:31.983 --> 27:33.443
Oh, I've thought about it.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.403
You know I have.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.571
I've proposed to you before.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.365
You just never said yes.

27:38.448 --> 27:42.702
{\an1}So, you thought you were
fairly safe that I'd say no?

27:42.786 --> 27:44.871
{\an3}(sighs)

27:44.954 --> 27:49.459
Oh, believe me, I've
never felt less safe.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.627
But I want this.

27:50.710 --> 27:53.129
Forever?

27:53.213 --> 27:54.506
Because that's what
we're talking about.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.133
Yeah.

27:57.217 --> 28:01.763
Do you have a bag or something
that I can put this stuff in?

28:01.846 --> 28:04.432
My car's a mess.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.059
You're taking it home?

28:06.142 --> 28:08.812
Yeah, I think we should just

28:08.895 --> 28:10.605
{\an1}leave things the way
they are now.

28:10.688 --> 28:11.564
My stuff at my place...

28:11.648 --> 28:12.941
You at your place.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.610
For now, until we get married.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.445
We have the rest
of our lives, right?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.281
{\an3}Yeah, yeah.

28:20.365 --> 28:23.201
It's gonna be great.

28:45.932 --> 28:48.017
Hey, you, I didn't
know you were here.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.018
{\an1}Hey.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.270
Want a drink?

28:50.353 --> 28:52.021
No, thanks, I was just

28:52.105 --> 28:53.481
waiting for Noah.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.483
{\an1}So...
Oh, that's really something.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.693
Yeah. (chuckles)

28:56.776 --> 28:57.986
So, uh, where's,
where's Valerie?

28:58.069 --> 29:00.488
Hmm.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.990
I don't know.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.116
Wanna join us?

29:03.199 --> 29:05.660
No, no, thanks.

29:05.743 --> 29:07.787
Oh, okay.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.998
Hey, you're not, uh,
driving or anything?

29:10.081 --> 29:12.500
No, I, uh...

29:13.751 --> 29:15.170
I'll call a cab.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.881
Oh, okay, good.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.220
Uh, give us a minute, all right?

29:24.304 --> 29:26.473
{\an3}Hey.
Hey.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.141
I'm going to grab a drink.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.851
Can I get you anything?

29:29.934 --> 29:31.019
Oh, no, thanks.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.520
{\an3}But you know what,
there's a friend of mine

29:32.604 --> 29:34.564
{\an3}sitting right there at
the bar, his name's David.

29:34.647 --> 29:35.982
Oh, okay, I'll say hello.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.275
{\an3}Cool.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.947
So, did you keep your promise?

29:43.031 --> 29:45.950
{\an1}I gotta tell you something
about me and Gwynneth.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.830
{\an1}Uh, um, hey, get Gwynneth
anything she wants.

29:50.914 --> 29:53.208
{\an1}Merlot, thanks.
Uh, anybody else?

29:53.291 --> 29:54.667
{\an1}You guys want
something to drink?

29:54.751 --> 29:55.877
It's on me.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.338
{\an1}I went to the ATM
like a big boy.

29:58.421 --> 30:00.548
{\an3}How many of those
have you had?

30:00.632 --> 30:03.176
Look, we were kids.
We were best friends, you know?

30:03.259 --> 30:05.470
I'm starting to think maybe,
to her, it meant more.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.639
Yeah?

30:07.722 --> 30:09.057
Go on, don't drag this out.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.060
We were on the Ferris wheel
and she wanted to kiss me.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.436
So, you kissed her?

30:13.520 --> 30:14.521
You said you wanted
honesty, right?

30:16.147 --> 30:18.691
Donna...

30:36.626 --> 30:37.794
You're not speaking to me?

30:41.464 --> 30:43.633
I love Kelly and I would do
anything for her.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.927
Know that before
you rip into her.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.763
Brandon, I try to be
a good person, I really do.

30:50.181 --> 30:53.268
I just, sometimes
it goes wrong for me.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.477
It's not that hard.

30:54.561 --> 30:58.314
You know that patient that
needs a bone marrow transplant?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.568
He's a child molester.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.614
How do you know?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.950
His kids told me.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.454
I mean, he molested
both of his daughters.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.415
I saw his grandkids.

31:15.498 --> 31:18.793
I looked at his, his eight
year old grandchild and...

31:18.876 --> 31:23.298
(sighs)
...and I thought...

31:23.381 --> 31:26.134
If you don't do this,

31:26.217 --> 31:27.635
you'll be taking a man's life.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.513
I believe I'll be saving one.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.568
Here we go again.

31:54.537 --> 31:57.081
Ah... ha!

31:58.875 --> 32:01.961
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
forget my code this time.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.172
{\an1}See that?

32:04.255 --> 32:05.548
Steady as an oak.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.636
I'm off to the ATM!

32:12.930 --> 32:16.184
{\an3}He took a gun from
under the bar.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.811
NOAH:
David!

32:18.895 --> 32:20.021
What?

32:20.104 --> 32:22.523
Noah, I'm good
for the tab, geez.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.484
Come on, man.

32:24.567 --> 32:26.110
Dude, where the
hell's the ATM?

32:29.030 --> 32:30.865
(David muttering)

32:30.948 --> 32:32.075
What are you doing?

32:32.158 --> 32:36.037
None of this
looks familiar.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.705
Dude, get...

32:37.789 --> 32:41.709
Give me, I'm not even
done counting to 50 yet.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.836
Stay back, okay?

32:43.920 --> 32:45.046
Wait a second, I don't need to.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.506
Then again,

32:46.589 --> 32:49.592
I didn't need to give
that guy all my money.

32:49.676 --> 32:52.053
{\an1}I didn't have to start
shaking so bad I couldn't,

32:52.136 --> 32:56.683
I couldn't remember
four simple numbers.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.601
Do you know what an idiot

32:58.685 --> 33:01.229
that made me feel like?

33:01.312 --> 33:02.605
Give me the gun.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.273
What's wrong with you?

33:04.357 --> 33:05.400
You're the one that told me to
get a gun in the first place.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.443
{\an3}Yeah, I know I did, just
give me the gun, all right?

33:07.527 --> 33:09.570
(chuckles)

33:09.654 --> 33:10.947
What the hell, are you

33:11.030 --> 33:12.657
afraid of it
or something?

33:12.740 --> 33:13.741
(snickers)

33:18.621 --> 33:20.581
(guffaws)

33:20.665 --> 33:22.208
See that?!

33:23.793 --> 33:28.589
Oh, man, I really gotta
get me one of these.

33:32.635 --> 33:34.846
(shrieks)

33:36.597 --> 33:38.057
It's okay, okay, okay.

33:38.141 --> 33:40.935
{\an3}Easy, easy, easy,
easy...

33:41.018 --> 33:43.938
(sobbing)

33:44.021 --> 33:45.481
Dude, I didn't
shoot at her.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.942
{\an3}Well, you got her,
all right?

33:54.532 --> 33:55.408
NOAH:
<i>Somebody help her!</i>

33:55.491 --> 33:57.452
Come on, she's bleeding!

33:57.535 --> 33:59.996
{\an3}Set her down right here.
Hey, what happened?

34:00.079 --> 34:01.581
{\an5}Don't leave me.
I won't
leave you.

34:01.664 --> 34:04.459
{\an3}A bullet ricocheted off
and it hit her in the arm.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.835
Hey, hey, I'm sorry.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.795
I'm so sorry.
Miss, miss...

34:07.879 --> 34:10.339
{\an5}It's okay, man.
It's okay, David.
miss, miss,
can you understand me?

34:10.422 --> 34:11.132
It's all right.
My arm hurts.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.467
{\an6}Does it hurt
anywhere else?
No.

34:13.551 --> 34:14.635
I'm cold.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.804
Doctor! Doctor, we've got a
GSW in the left extremity.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.139
I'm not going
to leave you.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.475
I'm not going
to leave you.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.143
{\an3}All right;
it's all right.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.311
Where are you taking her?

34:23.393 --> 34:24.312
{\an3}The doctor's going
to examine her.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.481
{\an3}But from what I saw,
she's going to be fine.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.399
{\an3}All right?

34:31.485 --> 34:33.321
We'll need a safety
officer right away.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.489
{\an5}What do you mean,
safety officer?
I'm holding.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.114
Hospital police.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.992
You did shoot someone.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.583
(knocking at door)

34:47.585 --> 34:51.172
Hi. Um, thanks
for seeing me so late.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.465
This is my friend
Brandon Walsh.

34:52.547 --> 34:53.299
How you doing?

34:53.382 --> 34:55.384
Worried sick
ever since you called.

34:55.467 --> 35:00.181
{\an3}Look, um, I'm not going
to donate my bone marrow.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.017
{\an3}I'm really sorry
about your father,

35:03.100 --> 35:05.686
{\an3}but I had to make a choice
that I could live with.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.522
That you could live with.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.524
You're killing him.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.609
You're killing my father.

35:13.069 --> 35:15.404
Murderer!

35:20.326 --> 35:21.911
Come on, let's go.

35:27.291 --> 35:30.044
{\an1}Oh, bride?

35:30.127 --> 35:31.337
{\an3}Hey.
Hey.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.547
What is this?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.549
A wedding planner.

35:34.632 --> 35:39.512
Aw, thank you.

35:39.595 --> 35:42.640
{\an3}I see that you started
the "to do" list.

35:42.723 --> 35:45.101
{\an1}First thing,
you have to pick a date.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.561
I can't.

35:46.644 --> 35:49.522
{\an3}Not until Brandon
gets used to the idea.

35:49.605 --> 35:51.482
This was his idea.

35:51.566 --> 35:52.900
I know.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.569
I was upset and...

35:54.652 --> 35:57.947
{\an3}he swore that he loved me,
and when I was still crying,

35:58.030 --> 36:00.533
he asked me to marry him.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.743
What were you crying about?

36:02.827 --> 36:04.412
Us.

36:04.495 --> 36:06.205
Me.

36:06.289 --> 36:09.250
Lately, I've been really
jealous and suspicious.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.587
And just angry at him.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.590
{\an1}Well, last night,
Noah told me something

36:15.673 --> 36:19.886
{\an1}that he knew would hurt me
and it did and I freaked out,

36:19.969 --> 36:21.596
{\an1}and when I woke up
this morning,

36:21.679 --> 36:24.891
{\an1}I just realized
that I trust him.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.435
Do you trust Brandon?

36:27.518 --> 36:30.771
There was a time when
I would have said yes.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.940
{\an1}Well, if you
can't say yes now,

36:33.024 --> 36:36.444
you should say no
to the proposal.

36:36.527 --> 36:39.530
{\an3}All right, one more jewelry
store and that's it, I swear.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.074
{\an1}What are we doing even
looking for engagement rings?

36:42.158 --> 36:43.284
{\an3}I don't know,
'cause I'm engaged?

36:43.367 --> 36:45.453
But you have a ring-- you got
one for Kelly a few years ago.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.163
{\an3}I'm not giving her that
ring again; it's bad luck.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.414
What are you talking about?

36:48.497 --> 36:49.624
{\an3}Steve that ring's
been back and forth

36:49.707 --> 36:51.459
more times than
a tennis ball.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.669
{\an3}Every time we got
together, broke up...

36:53.753 --> 36:56.422
And gotten back together.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.132
That's not baggage, Bran.

36:58.215 --> 36:59.300
That's an achievement.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.927
I'm not so sure.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.094
The ring shouldn't matter.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.804
It's the point of the thing.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.599
The point is you gotta make
your own luck, Brandon.

37:06.682 --> 37:08.434
You find each other

37:08.517 --> 37:10.478
and then you gotta find a way
to make it work.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.438
But there were times
when we couldn't make it work.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.814
When you're married,

37:13.898 --> 37:15.483
you don't have the luxury of
breaking up for a year,

37:15.566 --> 37:17.360
{\an3}dating other people
and then deciding

37:17.443 --> 37:18.945
you made a huge mistake.

37:19.028 --> 37:21.489
Well, if you're having doubts,
you better slow down.

37:21.572 --> 37:24.158
All we did was get engaged.

37:24.241 --> 37:26.160
{\an1}Which means
she's planning a wedding.

37:26.243 --> 37:28.412
It's like Godzilla
at the bottom of the sea,

37:28.496 --> 37:29.497
amassing size.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.748
If you're gonna stop it,

37:30.831 --> 37:32.541
you've got to do it now.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.960
Thank you, Doctor Ruth.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.086
(engine starts)

37:38.297 --> 37:40.383
DONNA: <i> I'm really sorry</i>
<i>I walked out on you.</i>

37:40.466 --> 37:44.220
It's just... when you said
you kissed another woman,

37:44.303 --> 37:45.638
I guess I couldn't deal.

37:45.721 --> 37:47.974
{\an3}Look, if it didn't bother
you, then I'd worry.

37:54.146 --> 37:55.690
{\an1}So, what did the doctors say
about Gwynneth?

37:55.773 --> 37:56.691
Well, the bullet
grazed her arm,

37:56.774 --> 37:58.484
{\an3}but the biggest risk
right now is infection.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.820
Right.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.196
What's going
to happen to David?

38:02.279 --> 38:04.198
{\an3}The cops interviewed him
and released him last night.

38:04.281 --> 38:05.366
They think the
DA is probably

38:05.449 --> 38:06.617
{\an3}going to hit him
with a misdemeanor--

38:06.701 --> 38:09.412
discharging a firearm.

38:09.495 --> 38:11.664
I'm getting rid of the
guns, it's that simple.

38:11.747 --> 38:13.874
Good, I'm glad.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.502
(door opening)

38:16.585 --> 38:17.753
I think she's up.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.588
Gwynneth's here?

38:19.672 --> 38:20.881
Yeah.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.259
Hi.

38:24.677 --> 38:25.553
Thanks for the shirt.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.596
I had to change
in the middle of the night.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.764
It was bleeding.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.603
The bandages
held up, huh?

38:34.687 --> 38:39.358
Gwynneth, I feel really bad
that this happened to you.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.777
Oh, thanks.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.404
I called your work and let them
know you'd be back mid-week.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.449
You're staying here?

38:46.532 --> 38:49.410
Noah insisted.

38:49.493 --> 38:50.453
{\an1}If you mind I...
I do.

38:50.536 --> 38:51.704
The boat,

38:51.787 --> 38:53.706
it's damp and cold
and it rocks

38:53.789 --> 38:55.875
and you are in pain.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.084
{\an1}It's not that bad,
really.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.294
Well, Kelly and I

38:58.377 --> 38:59.587
have an extra bedroom
in our apartment.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.547
And one of us are always
around at night,

39:01.630 --> 39:04.050
especially since he's
always working at the club.

39:04.133 --> 39:07.094
{\an1}Oh, that's really sweet of
you, but it's not necessary.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.554
No, no, no, no.

39:08.637 --> 39:12.266
{\an1}I insist, okay?
Mm-hmm.

39:12.349 --> 39:13.392
Okay.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.905
{\an3}Mud-- this
tastes like mud.

39:25.988 --> 39:30.701
Exactly what qualifications did
our new young assistant meet?

39:30.785 --> 39:32.787
Mine.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.872
You could be
more welcoming, too.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.174
Sarah, hi.

39:45.257 --> 39:46.425
Hi.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.135
{\an1}Did you reconsider
our offer?

39:48.219 --> 39:50.096
Uh, not exactly.

39:50.179 --> 39:51.931
(clears throat)

39:52.014 --> 39:54.266
See, I can't work with you.

39:54.350 --> 39:55.601
It'd be awful.

39:55.684 --> 39:58.145
No need to drive the point home.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.438
{\an3}No, I mean,

39:59.522 --> 40:00.981
I'd be nervous.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.274
I couldn't think,

40:02.358 --> 40:04.360
I wouldn't do
well, and, uh,

40:04.443 --> 40:05.528
you'd fire me.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.822
No... never.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.031
Well, you'd have to.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.784
But it'd be okay.

40:13.410 --> 40:16.872
Uh, maybe then we could go out.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.667
I'm a little confused.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.961
Do you want the job
or do you not want the job?

40:22.044 --> 40:25.631
Well, it's just that, um...

40:25.714 --> 40:28.843
See, I don't date people
I work with.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.511
{\an3}Or for.

40:30.594 --> 40:34.056
But, uh,
I'd like to go out with you.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.183
If you're free.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.685
I mean,
it doesn't have to be a date.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.937
But I'd like it to be.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.190
(laughing)

40:43.274 --> 40:46.694
Um, God, maybe I should've
just taken the job.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.321
It's filled.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.531
Mitch!

40:50.614 --> 40:53.951
Congratulations!
Welcome aboard.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.172
You're home. I, um...

41:07.298 --> 41:08.674
I left messages.

41:12.636 --> 41:15.514
{\an3}You heard what
happened last night?

41:15.598 --> 41:17.725
{\an1}Yeah.

41:17.808 --> 41:18.684
Why didn't you call me?

41:18.767 --> 41:20.603
I would have come down
to the police station.

41:20.686 --> 41:23.564
{\an3}The hospital called.
They were looking for you.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.400
{\an1}Yeah, I gave
them this number.

41:26.483 --> 41:28.068
{\an3}They found a match
for that guy.

41:29.486 --> 41:31.405
How do you feel about that?
I don't know.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.574
You want to think about it?
I don't want to.

41:33.657 --> 41:37.411
{\an3}Well, I really wish
you would have done it.

41:37.494 --> 41:40.498
{\an1}He molested both
of his daughters, David.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.630
{\an6}Look, Val, I don't know
what it was like for you
with your dad...

41:47.713 --> 41:49.423
{\an1}This has nothing
to do with my father.

41:49.506 --> 41:51.884
I know... what it's like
to feel powerless, okay?

41:51.967 --> 41:54.803
You think you could have done
something, but you couldn't.

41:54.887 --> 41:55.804
You don't know anything.

41:55.888 --> 41:58.140
He had all the power.
You were a kid, okay?

41:58.224 --> 42:00.059
{\an3}And you wanted to kick
and you wanted to scream...

42:00.142 --> 42:01.310
Stop, just stop, just stop,
okay?

42:01.393 --> 42:03.229
{\an5}But you couldn't, Val.
Just stop it,
David just stop it!

42:03.312 --> 42:04.521
Because you were terrified.

42:05.648 --> 42:06.941
And you think you're fine.

42:07.024 --> 42:09.443
{\an3}I'm fine. I am fine.
You're not fine.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.945
{\an3}It's not fine!
I'm fine!

42:11.028 --> 42:13.656
{\an3}It's wearing you down.
Val, it's wearing us down.

42:14.698 --> 42:16.450
Those two situations
are completely different.

42:16.533 --> 42:19.245
They're different
except for the fact

42:19.328 --> 42:20.454
that two people could have died

42:20.538 --> 42:22.539
because we didn't want to deal
with what happened to us.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.294
You got to talk to someone.

42:27.378 --> 42:30.089
I did.

42:30.172 --> 42:32.132
I did and now
you're turning it against me.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.425
Val, a professional.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.802
Someone who can help you.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.053
I can't.

42:36.136 --> 42:39.682
How dare you judge me.

42:39.765 --> 42:41.308
I mean, I remember you
being about this far

42:41.392 --> 42:42.309
from the edge of the cliff.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.979
Well, you were standing
right up there with me.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.022
And you know what?
You were so calm,

42:47.106 --> 42:48.440
I thought you were fearless.

42:48.524 --> 42:51.986
{\an3}But now I realize you were
comfortable up there,

42:52.069 --> 42:54.405
and I'm not.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.493
You go too far, Val.
You just... You go too far.

43:05.207 --> 43:08.669
{\an1}There's a jeweler on
Third Street that I like.

43:08.752 --> 43:11.338
{\an1}I was there looking
for an engagement ring.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.007
I already have a ring.

43:13.090 --> 43:16.385
{\an3}Actually, right down there
is where you asked me

43:16.468 --> 43:20.014
to marry you the first time.

43:20.097 --> 43:21.682
{\an1}I don't want you
to wear that ring.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.435
Why?

43:24.518 --> 43:27.563
{\an1}Well, I gave you that ring
to stop you from going away.

43:27.646 --> 43:31.567
{\an1}That's very different
than wanting to move forward.

43:31.650 --> 43:34.695
{\an3}Are you sure that's
what you want?

43:34.778 --> 43:39.241
Or are you just trying to
put the affair behind us?

43:40.451 --> 43:43.078
I don't know if we can.

43:43.162 --> 43:45.539
{\an1}I don't know how
anything's going to be.

43:45.622 --> 43:47.583
{\an1}I don't even know
what kind of ring it is

43:47.666 --> 43:51.045
that you want.

43:51.128 --> 43:53.547
{\an1}But I do know that
I want you in my life.

43:55.424 --> 43:57.426
Always.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.472
Will you marry me?

44:03.223 --> 44:06.101
Yes, I'll marry you.
