00:12.712 --> 00:15.147
Tucker, no.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.483
No...

00:26.392 --> 00:29.161
Don't.

00:29.228 --> 00:30.996
Tucker, no.

00:31.064 --> 00:33.765
Tucker, no.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.967
No.

00:36.035 --> 00:38.236
Get out!

00:45.845 --> 00:47.579
Get out. Get out.

01:09.335 --> 01:12.170
It's comin', man,
it's comin'!

01:52.979 --> 01:54.713
Ah ha!

01:54.781 --> 01:56.381
Ha ha ha!

01:56.449 --> 01:58.617
It's beautiful, ain't it?

01:58.684 --> 02:01.553
The wrath of God himself!

02:01.621 --> 02:03.688
Just wait, man!

02:24.010 --> 02:26.945
I finally
got him down.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.780
He still feel warm?

02:28.848 --> 02:31.583
Uh, the ibuprofen
must have kicked in.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.518
Ah, it's that preschool.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.987
Place is like
a petri dish.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.892
I thought you had
a few days off.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.128
What's the case?

02:43.196 --> 02:46.364
It's about
some missing kids.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.467
I guess you gotta
go in, then, huh?

02:48.534 --> 02:50.368
Please don't walk away
like that.

02:50.436 --> 02:51.703
We've talked about this.

02:51.771 --> 02:53.772
I know this is hard on you.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.240
Henry, too.

02:55.308 --> 02:56.182
On all of us.

02:56.207 --> 02:58.476
Look, if I had someone
to cover my shifts, I would.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.380
What if it was Henry?

03:02.448 --> 03:03.548
Don't.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.517
It's not Henry.
Henry's right in there.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.919
What if it was?

03:07.987 --> 03:10.322
You'd want someone out there
looking for him.

03:10.389 --> 03:14.226
No, I know. You're right.
It's just...

03:14.293 --> 03:17.329
Things worked better
when you were at the Pentagon.

03:17.396 --> 03:18.530
I wasn't helping anyone
there, will.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.366
You worked normal hours
and weekends off.

03:21.434 --> 03:23.568
Fine. I'll tell them
I can't come in.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.070
Don't do that.

03:25.137 --> 03:28.039
I was supposed to have time off.
Henry's not feeling well.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.108
It's all right.
You should go.

03:30.176 --> 03:33.111
I'll take care of it.

03:33.179 --> 03:35.080
Really, I got this.

03:35.147 --> 03:36.915
I'll see you
when you get back.

03:42.021 --> 03:43.488
You don't have to be here.

03:43.556 --> 03:47.058
Ah, I get antsy
when I'm gone too long.

03:47.126 --> 03:51.296
And thanks for the team's
donation to ALS in Carolyn's name.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.365
She would have
appreciated it.

03:53.432 --> 03:54.866
So how are you doing?

03:54.934 --> 03:58.236
I'm ok.

03:58.304 --> 03:59.905
It's funny, though.

03:59.972 --> 04:02.207
We were divorced
20 years.

04:02.275 --> 04:05.176
And I never missed her
as much as I do right now.

04:08.681 --> 04:09.848
Hey, you.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.416
Welcome back.

04:11.484 --> 04:14.219
Good to be back, Penelope.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.954
We're ready
when you are, sir.

04:17.023 --> 04:20.190
The bodies of two
unidentified boys

04:20.259 --> 04:22.527
were found near Wichita, Kansas,
a week apart.

04:22.595 --> 04:26.765
Both were Caucasian and
between the ages of 15 and 17.

04:26.832 --> 04:29.134
They were each found mangled
in the aftermath of a tornado.

04:29.201 --> 04:30.936
Yeah, but that's not
what did them in.

04:31.003 --> 04:33.638
The M.E. has determined that the
cause of death was blunt force trauma

04:33.706 --> 04:35.273
to the head
before the storms hit.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.575
Well, the death blow
in each case

04:36.642 --> 04:38.043
was in almost exactly
the same spot.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.878
Now, what about all the other
damage to their bodies?

04:39.946 --> 04:41.079
Some of their limbs
are missing.

04:41.147 --> 04:43.214
Yeah, victim number one,
his right leg was taken off.

04:43.282 --> 04:44.950
Victim number 2,
both arms were severed.

04:45.017 --> 04:47.085
But was that because of
the tornado or the unsub?

04:47.153 --> 04:49.721
The M.E. still hasn't discovered
that. He's a busy guy.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.325
Major storms have hit the area.
23 dead. The morgue is slammed.

04:53.392 --> 04:55.694
It fits the unsub. He's got a hell
of a sadistic streak.

04:55.761 --> 04:56.895
Well, a tornado
would clear the air

04:56.963 --> 04:59.230
and give the unsub
the privacy to do his thing.

04:59.298 --> 05:02.000
He may be using the storm
as the body disposition modality.

05:02.068 --> 05:05.036
Forensic countermeasure,
wind, hail, rain,

05:05.104 --> 05:06.838
mother nature destroys
the crime scene.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.913
Or he wants us to think
mother nature actually

05:08.938 --> 05:10.075
committed the murders.

05:10.076 --> 05:12.043
What concerns me is the
brief period between kills.

05:12.111 --> 05:13.678
Only a week.
He's moving fast.

05:13.746 --> 05:15.732
We need to move faster. Garcia,
get me I.D.s on all the victims.

05:15.733 --> 05:16.833
I'm a gale-force wind.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.035
Wheels up in 30.

05:18.102 --> 05:19.536
Oh, and pack for foul weather.

05:19.604 --> 05:21.738
The forecast is nasty.

05:31.950 --> 05:34.418
The National Weather Service
has issued a tornado warning

05:34.485 --> 05:37.220
for Sedgwick County, Kansas,
at 9 p.m. meteorologists...

05:37.288 --> 05:39.723
Yeah, we're back!
Told you!

05:39.791 --> 05:41.858
You owe me 5 bucks.

05:41.926 --> 05:43.860
Better pay up this time.

06:38.024 --> 06:39.525
George Gissing.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.768
Central Plains.

06:48.835 --> 06:50.669
Right in the middle
of tornado alley.

06:50.737 --> 06:54.006
If this unsub is using tornadoes
as a forensic countermeasure,

06:54.074 --> 06:55.441
then Kansas certainly is
the ideal setting.

06:55.509 --> 06:56.675
Tornadoes do pose
a significant threat.

06:56.743 --> 06:58.611
During this year's super
outbreak back in April,

06:58.678 --> 07:01.614
there were 336 confirmed
tornadoes in just several days,

07:01.681 --> 07:03.182
resulting in over
300 lives lost.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.718
Hey. Tell us
something good, mama.

07:05.786 --> 07:08.053
Ok, so local P.D.
have I.D.'d your victims.

07:08.121 --> 07:10.589
I'm putting this all on your tablets
if you'd like to follow along.

07:10.657 --> 07:14.193
First up is Jason Meredith,
16-year-old runaway

07:14.261 --> 07:16.570
from Garden City, Kansas.

07:16.595 --> 07:17.795
Mom said he took off
over a year ago.

07:18.465 --> 07:20.024
Next up is Eric Janelle,

07:20.049 --> 07:22.204
15-year-old foster kid
from Wichita.

07:22.369 --> 07:24.270
He's been gone 3 weeks.

07:24.337 --> 07:26.272
Oh, both of these kids
have records

07:26.339 --> 07:27.807
for possession
and prostitution.

07:27.874 --> 07:29.208
They were street hustlers.

07:29.276 --> 07:31.577
At-risk kids. This could
be a sexual predator.

07:31.645 --> 07:33.712
An extremely violent one
if the unsub is responsible

07:33.780 --> 07:35.714
for the damage done to the bodies,
especially those missing limbs.

07:35.782 --> 07:38.584
Well, now, he could be keeping the
body parts for some sort of fetish.

07:38.652 --> 07:40.085
Oh, ok, eew.
That is my cue.

07:40.153 --> 07:42.288
I'm here if you need me
with my binary machines

07:42.355 --> 07:43.756
that don't say gross things.

07:51.064 --> 07:52.765
I didn't know
you were a bad flyer.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.501
I'm not. I just hate
turbulence.

07:55.569 --> 07:58.571
You know, turbulence very
rarely causes planes to crash.

07:58.638 --> 08:00.792
That does me absolutely
no good at the moment.

08:00.817 --> 08:01.740
Thank you.

08:01.741 --> 08:03.843
What we really need to worry
about are microbursts,

08:03.910 --> 08:05.644
sudden downbursts of air
associated with thunderstorms.

08:05.712 --> 08:08.080
But a small craft like this,
if we hit one of those

08:08.148 --> 08:09.748
at the wrong altitude--
pulverized.

08:09.816 --> 08:12.918
I beg of you
to make him stop.

08:15.055 --> 08:18.224
A tornado outside Wichita
killed 2 and injured 9

08:18.291 --> 08:19.558
last night.

08:19.626 --> 08:22.228
The twister, which classified
as an F2 on the Fujita Scale,

08:22.295 --> 08:24.730
is the latest in a freak
series of storms

08:24.798 --> 08:26.098
to hit late in the season.

08:26.166 --> 08:27.766
More harsh weather
is expected

08:27.834 --> 08:30.236
as officials prepare
for the worst.

08:30.303 --> 08:31.837
The guy was torn up
pretty bad.

08:31.905 --> 08:34.340
Thought we'd find his arms,
but we never did.

08:34.407 --> 08:36.041
Found him right over there.

08:36.109 --> 08:39.111
Well, the unsub definitely has his
own mode of transportation.

08:39.179 --> 08:40.679
This is way off
the beaten path.

08:40.746 --> 08:42.220
And the first victim,
Jason Meredith, was found

08:42.245 --> 08:43.566
over 30 miles away.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.218
You say you were able to clear
this place before the storm hit?

08:46.286 --> 08:48.020
I didn't know you could
do that for tornadoes.

08:48.088 --> 08:49.633
When we get enough
lead time, we try to clear

08:49.658 --> 08:50.858
all the mobile home parks.

08:51.358 --> 08:54.260
The last place you want to be
in a twister is in a trailer.

08:54.327 --> 08:55.861
We close of
the main roads, too.

08:55.929 --> 08:57.963
Ok, so the unsub either
found a way in

08:58.031 --> 09:00.366
or he was already here and
he hid during the evacuation.

09:00.433 --> 09:02.534
That, or the body got sucked up
into the funnel cloud

09:02.602 --> 09:04.570
and was thrown here
from someplace else.

09:04.638 --> 09:06.772
Either way, he came into
close contact with this storm.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.074
Maybe even close enough
to put himself in danger.

09:09.142 --> 09:11.644
Or he waited someplace safe
for it to pass

09:11.711 --> 09:13.178
and came back
and dumped the body.

09:13.246 --> 09:15.981
No, I think the storm itself actually
means something to this guy.

09:16.049 --> 09:18.150
You don't think he's just
using it to cover his tracks?

09:18.218 --> 09:20.152
I played ball in college
with a guy from Indiana.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.655
He said he and his boys used to
get drunk and then chase storms.

09:22.722 --> 09:26.292
Said it was the closest they could
get to the true power of God.

09:26.359 --> 09:29.094
I saw an F3 when I was
in high school. He wasn't kidding.

09:29.162 --> 09:31.096
Ok, so he's impulsive,
probably young,

09:31.164 --> 09:33.432
maybe a loner
with nothing to lose.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.634
We should be looking
at actual storm-chasers.

09:35.702 --> 09:36.835
Where can we find them?

09:36.903 --> 09:38.837
They mostly work
with the university.

09:38.905 --> 09:40.673
You think
this guy's educated.

09:40.740 --> 09:42.432
Well, he knows enough
about the weather to

09:42.457 --> 09:43.875
use it to his advantage.

09:44.177 --> 09:46.211
So far it's working.

09:54.087 --> 09:55.587
Here you go.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.262
When was the last time
you saw Jason?

10:04.564 --> 10:08.033
The day he ran away.

10:08.101 --> 10:10.636
A little over
a year ago.

10:10.704 --> 10:13.205
He came and he hugged me
just like he always did

10:13.273 --> 10:14.773
before
he went to school.

10:14.841 --> 10:19.979
Do you know why
he would leave home?

10:20.046 --> 10:22.815
His father, Ray.

10:22.882 --> 10:24.950
He used to beat on me.

10:25.018 --> 10:26.652
On Jason, too.

10:26.720 --> 10:31.290
And how did Jason
cope with that?

10:31.358 --> 10:33.058
He'd always try
to protect me.

10:33.126 --> 10:35.160
Even when
he was a little guy,

10:35.228 --> 10:36.895
he always really
fought back.

10:38.298 --> 10:43.502
Sometimes if, afterwards,
if I was crying,

10:43.570 --> 10:48.307
he'd just come and he'd sit there
and hold my hand.

10:48.375 --> 10:51.076
So it sounds like you and Eric
were pretty good friends.

10:51.144 --> 10:53.879
Those other kids
ain't too cool at that house.

10:53.947 --> 10:56.081
Your foster mom said that you
used to get in a lot of fights

10:56.149 --> 10:57.416
before Eric got there.

10:57.484 --> 10:58.550
That's my boy.

10:58.618 --> 10:59.885
Nobody messes with me

10:59.953 --> 11:02.187
'cause nobody messes
with him.

11:02.255 --> 11:04.189
So he looks out for you.

11:04.257 --> 11:05.758
Yeah, we look out
for each other.

11:05.825 --> 11:08.293
When was the last time
you saw him?

11:08.361 --> 11:09.661
About 3 weeks ago.

11:09.729 --> 11:12.331
He said he was running
to the store

11:12.399 --> 11:14.566
and never came back.

11:16.770 --> 11:19.338
He in some kind of trouble
or something?

11:20.607 --> 11:23.442
We found him
a couple of days ago.

11:28.281 --> 11:30.616
He took the news
about Eric pretty well.

11:30.683 --> 11:31.884
Tough kid.

11:31.951 --> 11:34.586
I guess they have to be.
They're all alone.

11:34.654 --> 11:37.089
Each of the victims
had a strong protective instinct

11:37.157 --> 11:39.725
and was looking out for somebody
else besides themselves.

11:39.793 --> 11:41.627
Maybe the unsub
is keying in on that.

11:41.694 --> 11:44.463
Boys like that
are hard to fool.

11:44.531 --> 11:46.131
What if he used to be
one of them?

11:46.199 --> 11:47.914
I mean, those kids would
see right though someone

11:47.939 --> 11:49.139
trying to be a poseur.

11:49.235 --> 11:51.168
If his M.O. is connected
to the weather, he's gonna

11:51.193 --> 11:52.793
try to grab another boy soon.

11:52.806 --> 11:55.541
There's a major system
expected tonight.

12:13.827 --> 12:15.661
What's up, guys?

12:15.728 --> 12:17.563
Where can I get
some beers?

12:17.630 --> 12:20.732
Quickie Mart.
Take a right on Main.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.769
Sorry, man. I'm not from
around here. Where's Main?

12:23.837 --> 12:25.704
About 4 blocks that way.

12:25.805 --> 12:26.905
Thanks.

12:26.973 --> 12:30.008
Hey, uh, any of you guys
want to party?

12:30.076 --> 12:33.178
Got some tuss.
A little weed, too.

12:33.246 --> 12:35.681
How about you?

12:36.816 --> 12:38.484
Come here, buddy boy.
It's all good.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.821
He's too young.

12:42.889 --> 12:45.324
It's 100.

12:46.526 --> 12:48.093
I got 50.

12:48.161 --> 12:51.763
And I'll thrown in a couple of
sixers for you and your boys.

12:54.367 --> 12:56.268
Heh heh. Come on, man.

12:56.336 --> 13:00.072
Let's get in.
Let's go have some fun.

13:08.214 --> 13:10.115
Every slab in the house
is full.

13:10.183 --> 13:11.150
Could you hold that?

13:11.217 --> 13:13.218
We have two weeks over.

13:13.286 --> 13:15.020
Can't apologize enough
for the delay.

13:15.088 --> 13:18.991
4 years of med school,
most of the time it's old folks,

13:19.058 --> 13:21.326
heart attacks, and strokes.

13:21.394 --> 13:23.862
Now, I'm from New York.

13:23.930 --> 13:28.233
Not a whole lot of action
out here in Wichita.

13:28.301 --> 13:30.536
Your guys are right here.

13:30.603 --> 13:33.238
Identical blows
to the head.

13:33.306 --> 13:35.240
Well, that's what
tipped me off,

13:35.308 --> 13:36.842
not to mention
they're both John Does.

13:36.910 --> 13:38.544
Kids this age
get claimed fast.

13:38.611 --> 13:40.746
They had alcohol and
dextromethorphan in their systems?

13:40.813 --> 13:41.747
It's cough medicine.

13:41.814 --> 13:42.915
Yeah. You see it
with a lot of kids.

13:42.982 --> 13:44.883
It's a cheap high,
free if you can steal it.

13:44.951 --> 13:47.753
And these two had a whole
lot of it on board.

13:47.820 --> 13:50.055
What were you able to determine
from all the damage to the bodies?

13:50.123 --> 13:53.058
Well, it's mostly consistent with tornado
casualties I've seen before.

13:53.126 --> 13:56.261
Lacerations, abrasions,
massive internal trauma.

13:56.329 --> 13:57.763
Mostly?

13:57.830 --> 14:00.098
Well, their limbs.
Those are chopped off.

14:00.166 --> 14:02.167
I'm guessing with an axe
or a cleaver.

14:02.235 --> 14:06.004
Yeah, a dull one by the looks
of the tissue damage

14:06.072 --> 14:07.339
at the stumps.

14:07.407 --> 14:08.840
Cut off postmortem.

14:08.908 --> 14:11.176
Oh, definitely, but only minutes
after they were killed.

14:11.244 --> 14:13.011
You see the discoloration?

14:13.079 --> 14:16.248
The decomposition begins almost as
soon as the blood supply stops.

14:16.316 --> 14:19.885
They both have ligature marks
on their wrists and ankles,

14:19.953 --> 14:21.186
at least what
they have left of them.

14:21.254 --> 14:24.056
Good eye. Those are
all actually antemortem.

14:24.123 --> 14:25.624
They're from restraints.

14:25.692 --> 14:27.392
He held them
before the kill.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.194
Was there any sign
of sexual assault?

14:29.262 --> 14:32.564
Inconclusive. All the damage
made it impossible to tell.

14:32.632 --> 14:35.467
So, he gets them
drunk and high,

14:35.535 --> 14:37.603
he restrains them,
kills them,

14:37.670 --> 14:40.105
a cleaves off a limb
as a souvenir.

14:40.173 --> 14:43.775
Then he dumps the body and
lets the storm clean up his mess.

14:43.843 --> 14:45.110
But why the souvenir?

14:45.178 --> 14:48.113
What or who, exactly,
is he trying to remember?

14:52.619 --> 14:55.387
The National Weather Service
has issued a tornado warning

14:55.455 --> 14:57.322
for Butler County, Kansas.

14:57.390 --> 15:00.559
A large, violent storm moving
west at 40 miles per hour.

15:00.627 --> 15:01.860
Ok, time to go.

15:01.928 --> 15:03.528
...This large and
destructive tornado.

15:03.596 --> 15:04.997
Take cover immediately.

15:05.064 --> 15:08.900
This is an extremely dangerous
and life-threatening situation.

15:12.705 --> 15:14.773
Come on, let's go!

15:20.346 --> 15:21.780
Knock it off!

15:21.848 --> 15:23.181
We gotta go!

15:29.756 --> 15:31.623
Don't worry, buddy boy.

15:31.691 --> 15:33.392
I'd never forget you.

15:42.335 --> 15:45.237
Double or nothing
I find us another one?

15:45.305 --> 15:49.174
What, you scared
to lose again?

15:49.242 --> 15:50.976
All right, then,
gentleman's bet.

15:51.077 --> 15:53.679
That's my boy.

15:59.842 --> 16:01.576
Never seen anything like it.

16:01.644 --> 16:03.745
Name's Gary Dyson.

16:03.813 --> 16:06.581
16. Runaway
from Kansas City.

16:06.649 --> 16:09.084
A couple of my guys
have seen him before.

16:09.151 --> 16:11.586
I.D.'d him off the tattoos
on what's left of his arms.

16:11.654 --> 16:14.923
This particular area get hit with
a tornado last night?

16:14.991 --> 16:16.891
Thunderstorms came through.

16:16.959 --> 16:18.893
Warnings went out,
but no twisters.

16:18.961 --> 16:20.395
The weather's gotta be
the trigger.

16:20.463 --> 16:21.696
He's following the patterns.

16:21.764 --> 16:23.698
We track the storms,
we find the unsub.

16:23.766 --> 16:25.467
Forensic evidence
has been washed away.

16:25.534 --> 16:27.636
But behaviorally,
it's the most intact crime scene

16:27.703 --> 16:29.137
we've encountered
so far.

16:29.205 --> 16:32.073
It's the same blow to the head,
but no cuts, no abrasions.

16:32.141 --> 16:33.408
Except
he's missing his torso.

16:33.476 --> 16:35.010
It was only a matter of
time before he missed one.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.145
Tornadoes are extremely
unpredictable and sometimes

16:37.213 --> 16:38.980
last only a matter of minutes
before they dissipate.

16:39.048 --> 16:41.016
The fact that he was able to leave
his previous victims

16:41.083 --> 16:43.151
directly in the path
of one is astounding.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.042
So the conditions
were perfect last night,

16:45.067 --> 16:46.591
but his tornado never came.

16:46.722 --> 16:48.590
It's only been 4 days.
He's accelerating.

16:48.658 --> 16:50.425
And the weather's
driving him to do it.

16:50.493 --> 16:52.227
Guys, we know that
fetishists are loyal

16:52.228 --> 16:54.943
to the body parts they take,
but I think that this unsub

16:54.944 --> 16:56.882
is loyal to the whole
of these parts.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.415
If you were to take
the missing pieces from

16:58.416 --> 17:01.455
all the victims so far, you could
almost assemble an entire body.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.772
So he's not taking
bodies apart,

17:03.839 --> 17:05.440
he's putting one together.

17:05.508 --> 17:08.576
We're looking for a white male
in his mid- to late-20s.

17:08.644 --> 17:10.944
He's mobile and he travels
great distances to follow storms.

17:11.012 --> 17:12.579
He's probably in a truck
or a van.

17:12.647 --> 17:14.549
We believe he may
live in that vehicle.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.117
It's probably beat up,

17:16.185 --> 17:17.919
maybe rusted
from the elements.

17:17.987 --> 17:19.421
Sorry.

17:19.488 --> 17:21.522
Jeffrey Dahmer, serial killer,
was under the delusion

17:21.589 --> 17:23.558
they he could create
young male sex zombies

17:23.626 --> 17:24.858
that wouldn't resist
his advances.

17:24.926 --> 17:27.662
And when Dahmer's
test subjects died,

17:27.730 --> 17:29.564
he kept their body parts
as souvenirs.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.633
Skulls, hearts,
even genitalia.

17:31.701 --> 17:34.703
Restoring body parts
is no small task.

17:34.770 --> 17:36.571
They're gonna get ripe fast.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.843
He needs lots of ice,
salt, maybe, something

17:38.868 --> 17:40.008
to preserve them.

17:40.009 --> 17:42.644
And he's paying for all
that stuff somehow. Gas, too.

17:42.712 --> 17:45.213
He doesn't have the social
skills to hold a job for long,

17:45.281 --> 17:46.881
so he's most likely
a day laborer, handyman,

17:46.949 --> 17:48.350
anything transitory.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.285
We think he's using
the weather

17:50.353 --> 17:52.053
as a forensic countermeasure
to destroy evidence,

17:52.121 --> 17:54.667
but we also think
he might be some sort

17:54.692 --> 17:55.892
of symphoraphiliac.

17:56.125 --> 17:57.826
Sorry, symphora what?

17:57.893 --> 17:59.327
Uh, excuse me.

17:59.395 --> 18:02.397
Symphoraphiliacs--
they're sexually aroused

18:02.465 --> 18:03.398
by disaster.

18:03.466 --> 18:05.734
Usually fires
or traffic accidents.

18:05.801 --> 18:09.304
In this case, the weather
must enhance his excitement.

18:09.372 --> 18:11.940
He hunts street kids, so he
may be from a similar background.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.441
And he's most likely
uneducated,

18:13.509 --> 18:15.510
but he's still charming enough
to engage his victims.

18:15.578 --> 18:17.946
We'll talk to the press.
You should warn any transient kids

18:18.013 --> 18:20.615
you might know.
As this weather gets worse,

18:20.683 --> 18:21.883
so will the unsub.

18:21.951 --> 18:24.452
All right.
Let's get to it.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.789
Since when
is a seizure fine?

18:27.857 --> 18:29.491
The doctor said it's
normal for kids his age.

18:29.558 --> 18:30.825
But his fever broke.

18:30.893 --> 18:31.926
Yeah.

18:31.994 --> 18:33.595
It's back again.

18:33.662 --> 18:35.263
Did you give him
his medicine this morning?

18:35.331 --> 18:36.698
No. He was ok.

18:36.766 --> 18:38.133
No.
Did he feel warm?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.501
Well, you checked, right?

18:39.568 --> 18:43.271
JJ, of course I did.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.639
What are you trying to say?

18:44.707 --> 18:47.308
Nothing. I--

18:47.376 --> 18:49.310
where is he now?

18:49.378 --> 18:51.312
He's resting. I'm just waiting
for some paperwork

18:51.380 --> 18:52.814
and then we're gonna
go home.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.884
Ok. I'll call you
when my flight arrives.

18:55.951 --> 18:57.252
You don't have to
do that.

18:57.319 --> 18:58.686
Henry's sick.

18:58.754 --> 19:00.422
I'm coming home.

19:00.489 --> 19:02.991
Call you later.

19:06.662 --> 19:07.796
What's wrong?

19:08.798 --> 19:09.931
Uh, it's Henry.

19:09.999 --> 19:11.566
He had a febrile seizure.

19:11.634 --> 19:13.501
Will took him to the E.R.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.769
He--he's fine.

19:14.837 --> 19:16.271
Apparently
it's totally normal.

19:16.338 --> 19:17.806
Look, I gotta
get back home.

19:17.873 --> 19:20.008
Of course.
Anything I can do?

19:20.075 --> 19:21.876
Can I borrow the jet?

19:21.944 --> 19:24.212
I think the budget
oversight committee

19:24.280 --> 19:26.147
might not appreciate
my generosity.

19:26.215 --> 19:28.116
Yeah, well,
worth a shot, right?

19:28.184 --> 19:29.784
Check in and let us know
everything's all right.

19:29.852 --> 19:30.819
Ok.
Thanks.

19:30.886 --> 19:32.320
Hey, Hotch.
I've been thinking--

19:32.388 --> 19:34.456
the vast majority of unsubs
with this type of M.O.

19:34.523 --> 19:35.957
aren't driven
by the killing.

19:36.025 --> 19:37.492
They're really fascinated
by the body parts.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.961
Psychologically they exist in a realm
where fantasy meets delusion.

19:40.029 --> 19:42.864
It's basically the perfect blueprint
for the creation of a serial killer--

19:42.932 --> 19:44.365
- I'm rambling, aren't I?-
- Yes.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.800
Should probably
get to the point.

19:45.868 --> 19:48.436
I think I know how this unsub
may have gotten started.

19:57.012 --> 20:00.715
All right, the first victim was
found missing his right leg,

20:00.783 --> 20:03.384
the second, both arms,
and the third had no torso.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.653
So that leaves the left leg and
the head unaccounted for.

20:05.721 --> 20:08.156
We can assume the head would be
the most difficult piece to find.

20:08.224 --> 20:11.226
That part would have to fit
an unsub's fantasy perfectly.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.660
So he'd most likely
save it for last.

20:12.728 --> 20:14.229
Now, what that tells us
is there's a victim out there

20:14.296 --> 20:16.364
we haven't found yet
who's missing his left leg.

20:16.432 --> 20:17.832
Or the unsub hasn't
acquired it yet.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.168
True, but most body part
collectors evolve to this level,

20:20.236 --> 20:22.170
and in many cases they
exhumes bodies for parts

20:22.238 --> 20:23.438
before they start killing.

20:23.506 --> 20:25.006
All right,
let me call Garcia.

20:25.074 --> 20:28.109
So you think our unsub
did the same thing.

20:28.177 --> 20:30.411
P.G. at your service,
don't let the name fool you.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.313
Baby girl,
you're on speaker.

20:32.381 --> 20:34.349
Garcia, can you look for grave
robberies in tornado alley

20:34.416 --> 20:35.416
over the last 5 years?

20:35.484 --> 20:36.885
Okey-dokey.

20:36.952 --> 20:38.152
Searching.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.488
Oh. That's
a shockingly big list.

20:40.556 --> 20:43.224
Who knew grave-robbing
was so on trend?

20:43.292 --> 20:45.894
How many of those involve
the bodies of teenage boys?

20:45.961 --> 20:47.495
Uh...None.

20:47.563 --> 20:50.265
What about morgues
and funeral homes?

20:50.332 --> 20:51.666
Momentito...

20:51.734 --> 20:53.835
Again, that is a list
that should not be that big.

20:53.903 --> 20:56.104
Mostly stolen
embalming fluid, though.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.939
It's often used
like PCP, Garcia.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.408
I'm feeling optimistic
about the youth of America.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.310
There are no teenagers
involved in this either.

21:02.378 --> 21:04.913
All right, try looking for
thefts involving body parts,

21:04.980 --> 21:06.748
specifically left legs.

21:06.815 --> 21:08.573
Ok, eew! See, this is why
I can't talk about how

21:08.598 --> 21:09.998
my day was at dinner.

21:10.152 --> 21:12.487
Breakfast, lunch.

21:12.555 --> 21:15.223
Spencer, you scare me.

21:15.291 --> 21:16.524
Join the club.

21:16.592 --> 21:18.893
A left leg was stolen
off a body a year ago

21:18.961 --> 21:20.662
at the Riggio Funeral Home
in Tulsa.

21:20.729 --> 21:22.196
They never found
who did it.

21:22.264 --> 21:24.332
Garcia, what was the weather
like in the area at the time?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.601
Uh, thunderstorms and tornadoes.

21:26.669 --> 21:29.470
An F2 cyclone hit
right around there,

21:29.538 --> 21:31.839
and then the robbery
took place after they evacuated.

21:31.907 --> 21:33.174
It's gotta be our unsub.

21:33.242 --> 21:36.044
Wait, there's more.
The guy whose leg was stolen,

21:36.111 --> 21:38.513
he was a 47-year-old
father of 2 who died of leukemia.

21:38.581 --> 21:40.415
That's a huge jump.

21:40.482 --> 21:42.550
Preferential child sex
offenders don't usually

21:42.618 --> 21:44.686
stray from their
preferred age range.

21:44.753 --> 21:46.387
It's not about the sex at all.
He used the body

21:46.455 --> 21:47.855
from the funeral home
to develop his M.O.

21:47.923 --> 21:50.792
So he could live out his
fantasy and kill in a storm.

21:50.859 --> 21:52.961
It still doesn't explain
what or who he's building.

21:53.028 --> 21:54.662
Whatever it is,
this unsub won't stop

21:54.730 --> 21:56.331
until he finds
a perfect head.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.167
That's the final piece
to his puzzle.

22:32.067 --> 22:34.168
Hey! What's up, guys?

22:34.236 --> 22:36.237
Do you need a ride
or something?

22:36.305 --> 22:37.772
Uh, no, man, we're good.
Thanks.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.642
You sure? It's kind of
wet out here.

22:40.709 --> 22:41.876
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.478
Come on, man.
It's raining buckets.

22:43.545 --> 22:45.780
Hey. Get off me.

22:45.848 --> 22:48.316
Hey, man, it's cool.
It's cool.

22:48.384 --> 22:50.351
Come on.

23:10.439 --> 23:14.075
Hey! Fellas,
I was wondering,

23:14.143 --> 23:16.711
can you tell me the best way
to get to I-135?

23:16.779 --> 23:18.279
Yeah, it's back that way.

23:18.347 --> 23:19.280
Thanks.

23:19.348 --> 23:21.082
Appreciate it.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.984
I'm from Oklahoma.

23:23.052 --> 23:24.986
I don't get up here much.

23:35.856 --> 23:38.290
So there's nothing?

23:38.358 --> 23:42.261
Um, ok, what about
out of Kansas City?

23:42.329 --> 23:44.330
No. No.

23:44.398 --> 23:48.000
Um...Ok, thanks.

23:48.068 --> 23:49.935
Hey. Thought you
were out of here.

23:50.003 --> 23:52.104
Ohh. Flights are canceled
'cause of the weather.

23:52.172 --> 23:53.406
How's Henry?

23:53.473 --> 23:55.775
He's headed home.
Finally released him.

23:55.842 --> 23:56.776
That's great news.

23:56.843 --> 23:58.611
Where are
you guys off to?

23:58.678 --> 24:01.347
To the university to talk
to some storm chasers.

24:01.415 --> 24:02.615
Stay dry.

24:02.682 --> 24:03.616
Yeah, right.

24:09.723 --> 24:11.056
Who's that with Hotch?

24:11.124 --> 24:12.558
There's been
another abduction.

24:12.626 --> 24:14.927
A boy named Shaun Rutledge.
That's his younger brother Billy.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.462
He says a young
white guy in an RV

24:16.530 --> 24:18.130
attacked him with
a crowbar in the rain.

24:18.198 --> 24:21.000
He's also changed his victim
selection criteria.

24:21.067 --> 24:22.868
The boy he grabbed
gets straight As,

24:22.936 --> 24:24.904
plays football, even
volunteers at his church.

24:24.971 --> 24:27.306
So he wanted him so badly,
he was willing to leave a witness?

24:27.374 --> 24:29.141
Which suggests he's losing
touch with reality

24:29.209 --> 24:31.043
and his delusions
are starting to take over.

24:31.111 --> 24:33.179
What is it about this kid that
was so attractive to him?

24:33.246 --> 24:35.714
He was teenage and Caucasian
like the others, right?

24:35.782 --> 24:39.018
We also think that a sexual element
may actually not be at play.

24:39.085 --> 24:41.987
So then what the hell
is driving this guy?

24:42.055 --> 24:44.323
Maybe it's love.

24:45.559 --> 24:48.060
What if he's trying
to recreate someone he loves?

24:48.128 --> 24:50.429
It is an emotion
that drives us to extremes.

24:50.497 --> 24:51.864
If he's trying
to recreate someone,

24:51.932 --> 24:54.366
it's probably somebody
he loved and lost.

24:54.434 --> 24:58.871
Wait. You said he was
with his big brother, right?

25:00.774 --> 25:02.107
Holla at your girl.

25:02.175 --> 25:05.144
Baby girl, I need those great big
beautiful brains of yours.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.479
Jazz hands ready. Gimme.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.148
Ok, look at all the teenage male
victims or tornadoes

25:09.216 --> 25:12.218
in the last 10 years.
Same geography as before.

25:12.285 --> 25:14.019
That would be male,
13 to 18--42.

25:14.087 --> 25:16.989
How many victims had younger
brothers that survived?

25:17.057 --> 25:18.290
Uh...10.

25:18.358 --> 25:19.992
The unsub might have been
a high-risk kid.

25:20.060 --> 25:23.295
Garcia, how many of the
survivors have criminal records?

25:23.363 --> 25:24.730
I got two for you.

25:24.798 --> 25:27.399
First up is 27-year-old
Justin Harris,

25:27.467 --> 25:28.901
had a DUI in 2008.

25:28.969 --> 25:32.872
Next is 22-year-old
Travis James.

25:32.939 --> 25:34.573
Ooh, little troublemaker.

25:34.641 --> 25:37.610
Shoplifting, possession,
and prostitution. Oh, my.

25:37.677 --> 25:39.078
And all when
he was a minor.

25:39.145 --> 25:41.680
You got a home address or a
vehicle registered in his name?

25:41.748 --> 25:42.715
Uh-uh. None.

25:42.782 --> 25:44.250
You got a photo
on this guy?

25:44.317 --> 25:46.352
It's on your tablet
right now.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.488
All right,
this is a composite sketch

25:49.556 --> 25:51.457
from the description
the kid gave.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.749
I don't know why
you put up such a fight.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.488
We're gonna be
brothers, man.

26:22.556 --> 26:27.092
Me and you,
against the world.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.128
Old school.

26:29.195 --> 26:32.131
There. There.

26:32.198 --> 26:34.667
Oh, my God.
This poor kid.

26:34.734 --> 26:38.604
In 2001, Travis James
lost his big brother Tucker

26:38.672 --> 26:42.308
and his mom Jan when a tornado
hit the McCleary Trailer Park

26:42.375 --> 26:43.609
in Enid, Oklahoma.

26:43.677 --> 26:44.643
That's just south of here.

26:44.711 --> 26:46.278
So our guy's a local.

26:46.346 --> 26:49.248
- Oh, that's great.
- Everybody just sit tight.

26:49.316 --> 26:52.017
- It's gonna kick in.
- Hang on, Garcia. The power just went out.

26:52.085 --> 26:55.788
Garcia, I think
we're good. Keep going.

26:55.855 --> 26:58.090
Sometime before this
evil tornado touched down,

26:58.158 --> 26:59.992
Travis, along with
5 other boys,

27:00.060 --> 27:03.195
testified against
a one Roscoe Gulch.

27:03.263 --> 27:04.597
For what?

27:04.664 --> 27:06.432
It appears that
this Gulch character

27:06.499 --> 27:08.067
was a notorious
pedophile in the area,

27:08.134 --> 27:11.058
and he was a resident
of the same trailer park

27:11.083 --> 27:12.283
as Travis and his family.

27:12.439 --> 27:14.607
I'm looking at
police reports now.

27:14.674 --> 27:17.409
It looks like brother Tucker
had confronted

27:17.477 --> 27:19.044
this Gulch person
lots of times.

27:19.112 --> 27:21.046
He even broke
the creep's nose once.

27:21.114 --> 27:22.314
He was protecting
his little brother.

27:22.382 --> 27:24.516
Ohh. And then the plot
thickens.

27:24.584 --> 27:26.819
According to a statement
from Travis,

27:26.886 --> 27:29.488
right after Gulch
was acquitted,

27:29.556 --> 27:32.725
he and his brother
went to Gulch's mobile home.

27:39.232 --> 27:41.967
It's gonna be ok.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.636
A fight ensued.

27:43.703 --> 27:47.072
Travis said it was like
his big brother went crazy.

27:47.140 --> 27:48.974
He was upset
about the acquittal

27:49.042 --> 27:51.043
and dealt some
justice of his own.

27:54.581 --> 27:56.649
Travis said
he heard tornado sirens.

28:00.253 --> 28:03.722
It's a tornado!
Get out of here!

28:03.790 --> 28:05.924
Tucker, look out!

28:05.992 --> 28:08.794
He then ran to
a drainage pipe nearby.

28:13.266 --> 28:15.868
After that, Tucker and Gulch
somehow got trapped

28:15.935 --> 28:19.405
in the mobile home
when the twister hit.

28:21.441 --> 28:23.375
Travis said he saw
the mobile home

28:23.443 --> 28:25.744
get swallowed up
by the tornado.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.782
And when he came out
there was nothing left.

28:29.849 --> 28:32.618
Garcia, how old was Tucker
when he was killed?

28:32.686 --> 28:33.719
17.

28:33.787 --> 28:35.454
He was found in pieces.

28:35.522 --> 28:38.557
It took his DNA and
dental records to I.D. him.

28:38.625 --> 28:42.861
Travis went into foster care and
he was reported missing in 2003.

28:42.929 --> 28:44.096
He ran away.

28:44.164 --> 28:45.464
10 years ago his brother
got ripped apart,

28:45.532 --> 28:47.066
and now he's trying
to put him back together?

28:47.133 --> 28:48.767
But why start killing now?

28:48.835 --> 28:50.969
Garcia, send me current
weather reports for the area,

28:51.037 --> 28:52.604
including radar images
if you have them.

28:52.672 --> 28:55.841
Ask and you shall receive.
It is on your tablets.

28:55.909 --> 28:58.610
With the weather in the area, he's
going to be so excited, he won't wait.

28:58.678 --> 29:01.246
He'll take the boy to the closest
area with the most activity.

29:01.314 --> 29:04.083
That's right around here,
just southeast of us.

29:04.150 --> 29:05.584
It's Frankenstein.

29:05.652 --> 29:07.553
What?

29:07.620 --> 29:09.922
The unsub isn't just trying to put
his brother back together,

29:09.989 --> 29:12.157
he's trying to bring him
back from the dead.

29:12.225 --> 29:14.526
He believes that tornadoes
have the power to take life,

29:14.594 --> 29:17.362
so conversely, they should have
the power to restore it.

29:17.430 --> 29:19.732
We'll pick up Rossi and Prentiss
on the way. Let's go.

29:31.444 --> 29:32.578
Unh!

29:32.645 --> 29:34.847
Uhh!

29:36.216 --> 29:39.251
Uhh! Damn it!

29:48.027 --> 29:50.629
Damn. I need a beer.

29:50.697 --> 29:52.364
You want one?

30:03.042 --> 30:05.577
Ahh. [Belches] Heh.

30:05.645 --> 30:07.880
Ahh.

30:07.947 --> 30:10.816
Ahh, nothing like a cold one
to take the edge off, right?

30:10.884 --> 30:12.918
You sure you don't want one?

30:13.019 --> 30:15.087
It might make you feel better.

30:19.893 --> 30:21.293
Garcia, what have you got?

30:21.361 --> 30:22.694
Sir, I found your trigger.
A year ago,

30:22.762 --> 30:25.130
a tornado ripped through
a cemetery near Tulsa.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.199
One of the 53 graves
that was disturbed

30:27.267 --> 30:28.500
was that of Tucker James.

30:28.568 --> 30:30.002
His brother was killed
by a storm,

30:30.069 --> 30:31.970
then his memorial
was destroyed by one.

30:32.038 --> 30:34.106
Now he's using both to build
a memorial of his own.

30:34.174 --> 30:35.674
Now that he has
that boy's head,

30:35.742 --> 30:37.409
the delusion will completely
to take over.

30:37.477 --> 30:40.345
Garcia, those storm chasers at
the university we talked to,

30:40.413 --> 30:41.847
they should be out
in full force.

30:41.915 --> 30:44.349
I'm sending you
their number now.

30:44.417 --> 30:47.019
Tell them to be on the lookout
for the unsub's RV.

30:47.086 --> 30:48.520
And, Garcia, patch into
their radio chatter.

30:48.588 --> 30:49.988
They'll know
where the storms are.

30:50.056 --> 30:52.691
On it, my pretties.

30:59.032 --> 31:01.633
Come on, get it together.

31:01.701 --> 31:03.969
We're gonna have fun, bro.

31:04.037 --> 31:05.404
Like before.

31:05.471 --> 31:08.207
Remember that time
we stole mama's bourbon?

31:08.274 --> 31:09.541
Rode our bikes, what,

31:09.609 --> 31:11.777
10 miles to go see
them girls?

31:11.845 --> 31:14.713
God, what were their names?

31:14.781 --> 31:16.548
You thought
you were gonna get laid.

31:16.616 --> 31:17.716
Ha ha ha!

31:17.784 --> 31:20.285
And that chick.
Puked herself so bad,

31:20.353 --> 31:22.487
I thought I'd die.

31:22.555 --> 31:24.489
Do you remember that?

31:38.471 --> 31:42.474
Hey. It's gonna be
all right.

31:42.542 --> 31:45.777
We're gonna do this thing
tonight.

31:45.845 --> 31:47.012
Uhh!

31:48.514 --> 31:52.818
Why do you keep fighting,
you dumb son of a bitch?!

31:52.886 --> 31:53.952
You know what?

31:54.020 --> 31:57.456
Here, I'll show you.

32:18.457 --> 32:20.512
The National Weather Service
has issued a tornado warning

32:20.513 --> 32:23.615
for Sedgwick County in Kansas at 9 p.m.
Central Daylight Time...

32:23.682 --> 32:25.550
Ok, man!
Here we go!

32:25.618 --> 32:28.119
What'd I tell you?

32:30.756 --> 32:33.057
We need to head into those areas
with the most precipitation.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.992
So make a right
at the next intersection.

32:35.017 --> 32:36.217
It should be Pawnee Road.

32:36.729 --> 32:39.197
Hey, how exactly are we supposed
to chase this storm?

32:39.265 --> 32:40.999
The unsub won't actually
chase the storm.

32:41.066 --> 32:42.534
To get close to it,
you have to get in front of it.

32:42.601 --> 32:43.835
It's a little like
playing chicken.

32:43.903 --> 32:45.403
Uh-oh.

32:45.471 --> 32:46.471
What?

32:46.539 --> 32:48.606
It's frozen.

32:48.674 --> 32:49.874
Hey, Hotch.

32:49.942 --> 32:51.643
We just lost
the Internet.

32:52.645 --> 32:53.912
I'm frozen up, too.

32:53.979 --> 32:56.281
The weather must be
affecting the upload.

32:56.348 --> 32:57.282
I'm patching Garcia in.

32:57.349 --> 32:58.283
Yes, boss.

32:58.350 --> 33:00.218
Garcia, we just lost
our Internet

33:00.286 --> 33:01.753
and we need you to guide
us into the storm.

33:01.820 --> 33:03.555
Consider me
your eyes and ears, sir.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.391
Ha ha ha!

33:10.696 --> 33:11.735
Oh, yeah, it's a beauty.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.099
It looks like a landspout.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.600
Great funnel on that one.
She's heading north.

33:15.668 --> 33:18.770
Ok, guys, a twister
has been spotted near Rose Hill

33:18.837 --> 33:20.672
just south of your position.

33:20.739 --> 33:23.141
The storm-chaser dudes
are calling it a landspout.

33:23.209 --> 33:25.944
We don't want that one. Landspout
tornados are relatively insignificant.

33:26.011 --> 33:27.145
Where to, then?

33:27.213 --> 33:29.981
Garcia, look for hook
echoes on your monitor.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.316
Hey, hook echoes.
Yeah.

33:31.383 --> 33:33.651
Ok, I'm gonna do that.
Just tell me what they are.

33:33.719 --> 33:36.120
They're swirling hook-like
radar signatures

33:36.188 --> 33:38.356
that look surprisingly
like what you'd expect them to.

33:38.424 --> 33:40.658
Ok. Uh...

33:40.726 --> 33:42.260
No, I don't see
anything like that.

33:42.328 --> 33:43.861
They'll likely form
in those red and violet areas

33:43.929 --> 33:44.963
on the map.

33:45.030 --> 33:46.631
I don't see anything

33:46.699 --> 33:49.367
that looks even remotely
like that.

33:49.435 --> 33:51.202
Ok, they shouldn't be
too far from our current position.

33:51.270 --> 33:52.537
He's close.

33:54.106 --> 33:56.874
Oh, God. No, wait, wait,
yes! Yes, I see it.

33:56.942 --> 33:58.676
Oh, that's gotta be it.
Yes, ye--

33:58.744 --> 33:59.777
Where, Garcia?

34:00.980 --> 34:02.080
Oh, no, no.

34:02.147 --> 34:03.248
What? What is it?

34:03.315 --> 34:04.349
There are two.

34:04.416 --> 34:05.750
We'll have to split up.

34:05.818 --> 34:06.851
Which way, Garcia?

34:06.919 --> 34:08.219
Uh, ok. Half of you can stay

34:08.286 --> 34:09.587
in your current heading.

34:09.655 --> 34:11.489
The other half, make a...

34:11.556 --> 34:13.658
right on Meadowlark Road.

34:13.726 --> 34:15.525
Morgan, take Meadowlark
Road. We'll keep going.

34:15.594 --> 34:16.527
Got it.

34:32.878 --> 34:37.014
♪ Just begun to the fire
as I come undone ♪

34:39.418 --> 34:42.387
♪ I'm breathing
and it fills my lungs ♪

34:42.454 --> 34:45.422
Hey, I just got a hit from the
storm-chaser dudes on the RV.

34:45.491 --> 34:46.824
You guys are the closest.

34:46.891 --> 34:48.092
Where are we talking,
Garcia?

34:48.159 --> 34:50.928
Heading east on Sumner Road

34:50.996 --> 34:52.362
just north of your position,

34:52.431 --> 34:55.833
make a left on Prairie Creek.
It's the next left.

34:55.900 --> 34:57.468
You got it.

34:57.536 --> 34:59.437
Hang on, guys.

35:20.092 --> 35:21.459
Ha ha!

35:21.527 --> 35:23.361
It's gonna come
right through here.

35:23.429 --> 35:24.529
I know it.

35:24.596 --> 35:27.498
Just wait, man. Whoo!

35:31.603 --> 35:33.871
I'm coming, buddy boy.

35:33.939 --> 35:35.440
I'm coming.

35:59.865 --> 36:01.399
What are you doing?!

36:01.467 --> 36:02.734
It's almost time!

36:02.801 --> 36:04.402
Ha ha ha!

36:16.115 --> 36:18.282
You gotta stay still, dude.

36:18.350 --> 36:21.986
Trust me, it's all good.

36:22.054 --> 36:25.156
We ain't got time for this.
It's coming now!

36:25.224 --> 36:27.191
You want the hard way
or the easy way?

36:30.996 --> 36:32.830
What's that up there?

36:32.898 --> 36:33.998
Near the old house.

36:38.470 --> 36:41.472
No! Who are they?

36:47.212 --> 36:48.813
Travis James, FBI!

36:48.881 --> 36:50.148
Put the weapon down!

36:50.215 --> 36:51.249
You get back!

36:51.316 --> 36:52.750
We can't do that, Travis.

36:52.818 --> 36:55.420
I said get back! Are you hard of
hearing or something?

36:55.487 --> 36:58.322
Just let Shaun go
and we can work this out.

36:58.390 --> 36:59.824
That's his name, you know.

36:59.892 --> 37:02.093
He has a little brother, too.

37:02.161 --> 37:04.262
We know you saw them
when you attacked them.

37:04.329 --> 37:07.165
Just go! Get out
of here, please!

37:07.232 --> 37:09.033
Travis, Tucker
would not want this.

37:09.101 --> 37:12.203
He would want to protect you
like he did with Roscoe Gulch.

37:12.271 --> 37:14.105
That bastard was guilty!

37:14.173 --> 37:16.674
Just let him go
and we can help you.

37:16.742 --> 37:18.543
We don't need your help!

37:26.251 --> 37:29.554
I'm telling you,
we need to get to cover now!

37:29.621 --> 37:32.490
Come on, man,
put the weapon down!

37:32.558 --> 37:34.759
Put it down!

37:48.474 --> 37:50.141
We gotta go!
Gotta go!

37:58.150 --> 38:00.218
Me and you, man!

38:00.285 --> 38:03.087
Here we go!

38:03.155 --> 38:05.790
Whoo!

38:37.623 --> 38:40.124
"Adversity is like
a strong wind.

38:40.192 --> 38:43.794
"It tears from us all but the things
that cannot be torn,

38:43.862 --> 38:46.397
so that we see ourselves
as we really are."

38:46.465 --> 38:47.999
Arthur Golden.

38:49.434 --> 38:51.002
So the weather's supposed
to break tomorrow.

38:51.069 --> 38:52.503
I should be home sometime
in the afternoon.

38:52.571 --> 38:53.971
I'll call and let you
know for sure.

38:54.039 --> 38:56.007
Did you at least
catch the guy?

38:56.074 --> 38:57.775
Yeah. Sort of.

38:57.843 --> 38:59.877
It's kind of weird.

38:59.945 --> 39:01.913
You all right?

39:01.980 --> 39:03.481
I'm--I'm fine.

39:03.549 --> 39:06.784
It's just...

39:06.852 --> 39:09.287
Been a really long day.

39:09.354 --> 39:14.125
Listen, I'm really sorry
about everything.

39:14.192 --> 39:16.460
Yeah, me, too.

39:16.528 --> 39:19.497
So, uh, is he still up?

39:21.733 --> 39:23.834
Yeah, he said he's not
going to sleep

39:23.902 --> 39:25.503
till you read
his story to him.

39:25.571 --> 39:28.773
Headstrong little guy.
He's exhausted.

39:30.909 --> 39:32.643
Hang on.

39:32.711 --> 39:35.246
Hey, buddy.

39:35.314 --> 39:36.881
Guess who's
on the phone.

39:36.949 --> 39:38.716
Mommy!

39:38.784 --> 39:42.019
Hi! Hi, little man.

39:42.087 --> 39:44.589
How--how are you?

39:44.656 --> 39:47.525
I heard you, um,
you went to the doctor.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.660
Are you coming home, Mommy?

39:49.728 --> 39:52.263
Not yet, buddy.
Tomorrow.

39:52.331 --> 39:53.331
I promise.

39:53.398 --> 39:55.533
So, are you ready
for story time?

39:55.601 --> 39:57.034
Yeah!

39:57.102 --> 40:00.271
Yeah? Ok.

40:00.339 --> 40:03.174
Daddy, are you ready?

40:03.241 --> 40:05.843
"Bedtime for Baby Star."

40:05.911 --> 40:09.113
Once there was a Baby Star,

40:09.181 --> 40:11.515
he lived up near the sun.

40:11.583 --> 40:14.051
And every night at bedtime,

40:14.119 --> 40:16.721
that Baby Star
wanted to have some fun.

40:16.788 --> 40:20.758
He would shine and shine
and fall and shoot

40:20.826 --> 40:22.793
and twinkle, oh, so bright,

40:22.861 --> 40:25.696
and he said,
"Mommy, I'll run away

40:25.764 --> 40:27.632
if you make me say good night."

40:27.699 --> 40:34.105
And then his mommy kissed him
on his sparkly nose and said...

40:34.172 --> 40:35.840
"No matter where you go,

40:35.907 --> 40:38.476
"no matter where you are,

40:38.543 --> 40:42.013
"no matter how big you grow,

40:42.080 --> 40:45.483
"and even if you stray far...

40:45.550 --> 40:47.785
"I'll love you forever,

40:47.853 --> 40:52.023
'cause you'll always be
my Baby Star."

40:52.090 --> 40:54.525
Good night, Mommy.

40:54.593 --> 40:57.261
Good night.
