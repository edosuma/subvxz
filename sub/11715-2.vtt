00:03.754 --> 00:05.756
Sir, I just got a call
from your father.

00:05.798 --> 00:07.758
He's on his way up
to see you.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.551
Oh! I did not know
that my dad was in town.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.099
Sir, I know your father
can be intimidating...

00:16.141 --> 00:17.309
(GROANS)

00:19.269 --> 00:20.938
...but you're a grown m.

00:20.980 --> 00:21.772
Why do you allow him
to have this power
over you?

00:21.814 --> 00:23.524
I don't know.

00:23.565 --> 00:29.070
Why do you allow me
to have power over you?

00:29.112 --> 00:30.071
(SIGHS)

00:36.286 --> 00:38.038
Anyway, he's in town
for a couple of days,

00:38.079 --> 00:39.456
and he's excited
to meet your wife.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.666
What? No!

00:41.291 --> 00:43.794
My wife is Liz!

00:43.836 --> 00:46.421
I mean,
look at this grill.

00:46.463 --> 00:47.923
Sir, you're overreactin.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.967
She's not that bad.

00:50.009 --> 00:53.136
Compared to the chicks
he marries, she is.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.222
His latest wife is one
of the hottest, youngest
women in the world.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.766
That's it.
I need a professional escor.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.227
You're going to use
a prostitute

01:00.268 --> 01:03.104
to pose as your wife?

01:03.146 --> 01:05.482
That's a great idea.
When I'm finished,
I'll have her do that.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.984
Russell!
Hey.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.111
Come here,
you little flyweight!
Come on.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.238
Put 'em up!
Put 'em up!

01:13.782 --> 01:15.534
So, wait, what are you
doing in town, Dad?

01:15.576 --> 01:17.995
Well, I came in
to check up on
my company,

01:18.037 --> 01:22.457
and I thought I'd meet
that tasty little piece
you married.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.459
What do you think, Timm?
Is she a looker?

01:24.501 --> 01:29.256
In the sense that
she can see? Yes.

01:29.297 --> 01:32.259
Well, I've set quite
a high bar in the
marriage department.

01:32.300 --> 01:36.555
That is, if you
throw out Russell's
mother as a mulligan.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.808
It's funny because
she gave me life.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.142
Here, take a look
at my latest.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.477
I was in Tahiti,

01:43.520 --> 01:45.814
and I saw the most
beautiful woman.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.482
And then...

01:48.275 --> 01:53.030
I married her daughter.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.615
My God,
she's exquisite.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.659
Yeah? You should
see her naked.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.870
Matter of fact,
give me your email address.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.205
Oh, no. You don't
have to do that.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.960
It's right there on the.
All right.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.712
Russell,
let's see a picture
of your wife.

02:08.754 --> 02:10.422
Oh, Liz?
My wife? Um...

02:11.673 --> 02:13.258
I don't think
I have one like
here, handy.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.177
Well, no matter.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.055
Bring her to the club
tomorrow night, 6:00.
I'll meet her then.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.431
Okay, Dad.
Ho! Ha ha ha!

02:21.308 --> 02:22.183
I never liked that.
See you, Timmy.

It's Curtis Armstrong.

Yeah, we heard.

Shove it over, Booger.

Adam was actually
just about to tell me
how he and Curtis met.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.765
It was raining...
Mm-hmm.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.642
...and we both reached
for the cab door
at the same time, right?

03:45.684 --> 03:47.310
And I was like...
Remember?

03:47.352 --> 03:48.228
I was like,
"Where are you headed?"

03:48.269 --> 03:49.646
And I'm like...

03:49.688 --> 03:52.607
BOTH: "Where are you headed"

03:52.649 --> 03:54.151
And so we
get to chatting,
and whatnot.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.739
And what we realized,
that we have so much
in common, you know?

04:00.490 --> 04:02.450
Like I love
Revenge Of The Nerds.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.536

04:12.711 --> 04:15.338
Hey, uh, did the,
uh, doctor call?

04:15.380 --> 04:18.217
Yeah, uh, he said
the thing in my throat's
just a node,

04:18.258 --> 04:19.718
and, uh,
he's running some tests
to make sure it's nothi.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.302
And he said
I shouldn't worry.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.012
All right,
so let me guess.
You're going to worry.

04:22.054 --> 04:24.639
Of course I am!

04:24.681 --> 04:27.226
We won't know
the test results
till Monday.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.643
I'm going to need you
to keep me calm this weeke.

04:33.107 --> 04:36.484
Good start.
I'll see you in a bit.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.986
No test results
until Monday.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.738
This is devastating.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.156
Oh, my God.
Is she going to be okay?

04:41.198 --> 04:42.032

But this whole throat tg
is just going to wreck
my weekend plans.

Dude, I am sure
she can still
do other stuff.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.178

to Syracuse this weeken,

05:03.220 --> 05:04.345
to see my old

I can't.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.308
Wait. Can I?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.897
You do,
and she will
resent you.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.983
Yes, and when her,
uh, test results
come back fine,

05:16.024 --> 05:18.777
I will resent her.

in marriage,

there may be a way
for you to go

resent you.

have the answers.

Go ahead, Curtis.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.292
Okay.

05:34.251 --> 05:35.376
The key is to have
Audrey think

05:36.253 --> 05:37.545
it's her idea
that you go.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.297
How?

Be such a nice guy

too guilty to ask
you to stay.

on to something here.

be pampered.

my stomach's going,

whatever you got,
throw it at her.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.910

06:59.127 --> 07:08.262
You won't
be home tonight.

Oh, we have
a special delivery
for Audrey Bingham.

Wait, is the special dey
what's behind the baske?

07:20.440 --> 07:24.527
Not this time.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.904
Then that
is very nice.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.867

help keep your mind off
of your test results.

wine, romantic movies.

just say the word,

advice, Booger.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.838
You look beautiful.

of you to invite me.

they did a fine job.

to laugh in my face.

09:54.094 --> 09:54.761

the same hair as you?

is the operative word.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.055
He likes her boobs.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.768
You're bawdy.

the lesson is

have to embrace life.
