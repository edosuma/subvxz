WEBVTT

00:06.290 --> 00:08.460
Ace: HMM, LET'S SEE.

00:08.530 --> 00:12.730
I THINK I'LL HAVE A DOUBLE SCOOP
OF MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.760
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:13.830 --> 00:14.860
MAKE THAT A DOUBLE

00:14.930 --> 00:16.470
VANILLA FUDGE RIPPLE.

00:17.270 --> 00:18.500
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:18.570 --> 00:19.540
HOW ABOUT A DOUBLE

00:19.600 --> 00:20.770
PISTACHIO ALMOND

00:20.840 --> 00:21.970
WITH SOME SPRINKLES THERE.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.840
HEY, UH, LET'S COMPROMISE, DOC,

00:23.910 --> 00:25.610
AND JUST GIVE ME
ALL OF THE ABOVE.

00:26.680 --> 00:27.480
I'LL WORK IT OFF

00:27.540 --> 00:28.080
SAVING THE WORLD

00:28.150 --> 00:28.910
FROM SOMETHING.

00:28.980 --> 00:30.310
HUH?

00:31.980 --> 00:33.050
WHAAH!

00:40.160 --> 00:42.590
OOH. THAT PEANUT BUTTER
CARROT RIPPLE

00:42.660 --> 00:43.890
REALLY PACKS A WALLOP.

00:44.660 --> 00:45.560
HUH?

00:47.900 --> 00:49.030
I'D LIKE TO STAY AND CHAT,

00:49.100 --> 00:50.600
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,

00:50.670 --> 00:52.440
I GOT A TRAIN TO CATCH.

01:08.350 --> 01:10.190
HMM. THERE'S GOTTA
BE A BRAKE SWITCH

01:10.250 --> 01:12.620
SOMEWHERE ON THIS THING. YAAH!

01:12.690 --> 01:17.090
THAT'S MY TRAIN TO ROB,

OPHIUCHUS SAM IS GONNA BE
THE RICHEST,

01:20.660 --> 01:24.770
ROOTIN'EST-TOOTIN'EST OUTLAW
WEST OF ORION'S BELT.

01:24.830 --> 01:28.570
MAYBE THEN YOU CAN UPGRADE
THAT ROBO-DONKEY.

01:37.510 --> 01:38.750
OHH! WHOA!

01:42.220 --> 01:43.990
YOU KNOW,
I HEAR IT'S LESS DRAFTY

01:44.050 --> 01:45.420
RIDING INSIDE THE TRAIN.

01:45.490 --> 01:48.760
HEY, THANKS FOR
THE TRAVEL TIP, DOC.

01:48.830 --> 01:50.060
HOLD STILL,

01:50.130 --> 01:53.600

INTO SMITHEREENS.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.930
YAAH!

01:59.370 --> 02:00.240
THE NAME'S DEUCE.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.170
IT LOOKS LIKE

02:01.240 --> 02:02.570
YOU COULD USE SOME HELP.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.570
WHAT WOULD EVER GIVE YOU
A SILLY IDEA LIKE THAT?

02:04.640 --> 02:06.480
CALL IT A HUNCH.

02:06.540 --> 02:07.540
HAH!

02:09.110 --> 02:14.280

02:19.760 --> 02:20.290
YEAH.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.260
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE

OUTTA HERE.

03:40.870 --> 03:43.210
THE TRAIN AND EVERYTHING
ON IT NOW BELONGS

03:43.270 --> 03:44.970
TO--UHH!

03:45.040 --> 03:46.910
ME.

03:48.350 --> 03:49.950
YAH, MULE.

03:52.850 --> 03:54.650
Ace: THANKS FOR
THE ASSIST, DEUCE.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.950
YEAH. WE MAKE
A PRETTY GOOD TEAM.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.420
HEY, ACE, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT

03:58.490 --> 04:00.390
THE RUNAWAY TRAIN
AT THE PARK TODAY?

04:00.460 --> 04:01.390
HEAR ABOUT IT?

04:01.460 --> 04:02.930
I GOT BRUISES TO SHOW FOR IT

04:02.990 --> 04:05.760
IN PLACES I DON'T LIKE TO SHOW.

04:05.830 --> 04:08.160
HEY, LEX, THIS IS
MY NEW PAL, DEUCE.

04:08.230 --> 04:09.430
IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM--HEH--

04:09.500 --> 04:11.740
MY FURRY WHITE TAIL
WOULD BE TOAST.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.940
NO BIG DEAL.
YOU MIGHT SAY I HAVE A WAY

04:14.000 --> 04:16.870
OF BEING IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.740
SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND ACE
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

04:19.810 --> 04:22.850
ACE, I'VE BEEN
TO EVERY CORNER OF THE GALAXY,

04:22.910 --> 04:26.280
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BAD-BOY
SWORD LIKE THAT BEFORE.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.580
THANKS. IT WAS GIVEN TO ME

04:27.650 --> 04:29.450
WHEN I GOT INTO
THE ACTION-HERO BUSINESS.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.350
CAN I HOLD IT?

04:30.420 --> 04:31.920
Duck: HEY! I DON'T

04:31.990 --> 04:33.160
HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

04:33.220 --> 04:34.120
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER A YEAR,

04:34.190 --> 04:35.360
AND YOU NEVER ONCE

04:35.430 --> 04:37.290
LET ME HOLD YOUR SWORD.

04:38.230 --> 04:40.530
I WON'T EVEN ASK.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.770
HEY, ZODAVIA, THERE'S SOMEONE
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

04:43.830 --> 04:44.630
THIS HERE IS--

04:44.700 --> 04:45.600
DEUCE. HMM.

04:45.670 --> 04:48.000
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE YOU AGAIN.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.740
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

04:49.810 --> 04:50.910
ONLY TOO WELL.

04:50.970 --> 04:52.210
HEY, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

04:52.280 --> 04:53.810
LET'S JUST SAY DEUCE AND I

04:53.880 --> 04:56.910
HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES
IN THE PAST.

04:56.980 --> 05:00.650
SHE'S RIGHT. LOOK,
I KNOW I MADE SOME MISTAKES.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.920
I'M ONLY HERE TO ASK
YOUR FORGIVENESS

05:02.990 --> 05:04.750
AND A CHANCE TO START OVER.

05:04.820 --> 05:09.890
THEN YOU'VE MADE
A VERY LONG TRIP FOR NO REASON.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.460
PERHAPS I SHOULD LEAVE.

05:13.530 --> 05:16.770
NOT PERHAPS. DEFINITELY.

05:26.680 --> 05:30.050
Ace: SO, UH, WHY THE BUM'S RUSH
ON DEUCE, ZODAVIA?

05:30.110 --> 05:33.550
DURING THE FALL OF FRELENG,
THE LAST CRAFT TO DEPART

05:33.620 --> 05:36.150
WAS THE ROYAL INTERGALACTIC
QUASAR TRAIN.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.350
IT WAS RUMORED TO HAVE
CARRIED CARGO

05:38.420 --> 05:40.420
THAT COULD MAKE A MAN KING.

05:40.490 --> 05:44.090
Duck: WOWIE! SOUNDS LIKE CODE
FOR TREASURE.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.330
Zodavia: PAY ATTENTION, DUCK!

05:45.400 --> 05:46.500
Duck: WHAT?

05:46.560 --> 05:48.570
Zodavia: A STRAY PHOTON BLAST

05:48.630 --> 05:50.170
STRUCK THE TRANSPORT

05:50.230 --> 05:53.840
AND CAUSED IT TO LAUNCH
PREMATURELY ON A RUNAWAY COURSE.

05:53.900 --> 05:58.410
IT DISAPPEARED INTO A WORMHOLE
AND WAS BELIEVED LOST FOREVER...

05:58.480 --> 05:59.940
UNTIL RECENTLY.

06:00.010 --> 06:03.780
I FEAR THE ARRIVAL OF DEUCE
IS NO COINCIDENCE.

06:03.850 --> 06:05.650
YOU THINK
HE'S AFTER THE TRAIN?

06:05.720 --> 06:08.450
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE
THAT HE'S CHANGED.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.450
A RISK I CANNOT TAKE.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.690
THE TRAIN MUST BE STOPPED

06:11.760 --> 06:13.760
BEFORE IT FALLS
INTO THE WRONG HANDS.

06:13.820 --> 06:16.260
LOOK, EVEN IF WE CAN STOP
THIS TON OF METAL,

06:16.330 --> 06:17.290
HOW DO WE FIND IT?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.130
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN CATCH IT

06:19.200 --> 06:20.800
AT OUR LOCAL WORMHOLE DEPOT.

06:20.860 --> 06:23.170
I MAY BE ABLE
TO HELP ON THAT.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.670
IN A FEW MOMENTS, I WILL HAVE
THE EXACT TIME AND COORDINATES

06:29.740 --> 06:31.740
WHERE THE NEXT WORMHOLE
WILL APPEAR.

06:31.810 --> 06:33.380
ACCORDING TO MY ALGORITHM,

06:33.440 --> 06:36.510
IT WILL OPEN IN EXACTLY
7 1/2 MINUTES.

06:36.580 --> 06:39.720
THIS WILL LET YOU KNOW
HOW LONG YOU HAVE.

06:39.780 --> 06:42.650
TECH, YOU AND LEXI KEEP
MONITORING THE SITUATION.

06:42.720 --> 06:47.060
EVERYONE ELSE, IT'S TIME TO JET.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.330
HEY, WHAT'S MR. POPULAR
STILL DOING HERE?

06:50.390 --> 06:52.930
YOU'VE BEEN EAVESDROPPING
ABOUT OUR TRAIN.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.530
LOOK, I HEARD ABOUT
THE QUASAR TRAIN

06:55.600 --> 06:56.830
AND THOUGHT
IF I COULD BRING IT BACK,

06:56.900 --> 06:59.400
WELL, MAYBE I COULD EARN
ZODAVIA'S TRUST AGAIN.

06:59.470 --> 07:01.370
HUH.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.510
YEAH, ANOTHER SOB STORY.

07:02.570 --> 07:05.210
LOOK, LOOK,
WORLD'S TINIEST VIOLIN.

07:06.940 --> 07:09.580
SO, UH, DO YOU ALWAYS
GIVE UP SO EASILY?

07:09.650 --> 07:11.050
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:11.110 --> 07:13.250
DUCK, HE SAVED MY LIFE.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.420
AND YOUR POINT?

07:14.480 --> 07:15.890
EVERYONE DESERVES
A SECOND CHANCE.

07:15.950 --> 07:18.290
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.290
Ace: OK, LOONATICS...

07:22.360 --> 07:24.130
READY...

07:24.190 --> 07:25.390
SET...

07:25.460 --> 07:27.030
LET'S JET.

07:35.740 --> 07:38.370
Ace: LOOKS LIKE OUR TRAIN
IS RIGHT ON TIME.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.680
Deuce: LET'S CATCH OUR RIDE.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.650
YAAH!

07:48.820 --> 07:51.290
WE GOTTA WORK FAST
AND STOP THIS CHOO-CHOO

07:51.350 --> 07:53.260
BEFORE THE WORMHOLE
CLOSES AGAIN.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.160
DUCK, SLAM, CHECK THE CARS.

07:56.230 --> 07:58.490
REV AND I WILL GO UP FRONT.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.170
WHY, THEM NO-GOOD,
MANGY POLECATS.

08:02.230 --> 08:05.070
NO ONE STEALS THE TRAIN
I'M A-STEALIN',

08:05.130 --> 08:06.970
OR MY NAME AIN'T OPHI--

08:07.040 --> 08:10.240
ICHI

08:10.310 --> 08:11.940
WHATEVER IT IS.

08:12.010 --> 08:12.940
YAH, MULE.

08:14.180 --> 08:16.480
EVERY TRAIN COMES
WITH AN EMERGENCY CORD.

08:16.550 --> 08:18.650
THERE'S GOTTA BE ONE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.480
LOOKING FOR A CORD.
LOOKING FOR A CORD.

08:20.550 --> 08:23.820
LOOKING FOR A CORD.
THERE IT IS!

08:23.890 --> 08:25.420
HUH?

08:25.490 --> 08:28.090
NOW I GOT YA
RIGHT WHERE I WANT YA.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.360
SLAM, DO SOMETHING.

08:30.430 --> 08:33.230
SAY ADIOS TO ACMETROPOLIS...

08:33.300 --> 08:34.360
Duck: YIPES!

08:34.430 --> 08:37.370
AND SAY HELLO TO OBLIVI--
OBLU--

08:37.430 --> 08:39.670
EHH, WHATEVER YOU CALL IT.

08:44.410 --> 08:47.810
OOH, HOLD STILL,
YOU CONFOUNDED BIRD.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.310
SORRY.
DUCK CAN'T GO OUT AND PLAY

08:51.380 --> 08:53.720
UNTIL HE FINISHES HIS HOMEWORK.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.350
THANKS, DEUCE.

08:55.420 --> 08:56.720
MY HERO.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.170
AHA. I GOTCHA.

09:11.230 --> 09:12.600
HUH? THERE'S NO WAY

09:12.670 --> 09:14.400
THAT GOLDARN FEATHER DUSTER

09:14.470 --> 09:15.940
COULD HAVE GOT AWAY.

09:16.010 --> 09:17.770
ARE YOU SURE HE DIDN'T SLIP
AWAY, BECAUSE HE'S AWFULLY FAST

09:17.840 --> 09:19.140
AND CAN SLIP AWAY FASTER
THAN YOU CAN SAY, "SLIP AWAY,"

09:19.210 --> 09:20.210
EVEN THOUGH "SLIP AWAY"

09:20.280 --> 09:21.340
CAN BE SAID AWFULLY FAST.

09:21.410 --> 09:22.880
HEY, YOU LOOK AWFUL FAMILIAR.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.980
SAY SAYONARA, BEAK BREATH.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.560
NICE WORK, DEUCE.

09:35.630 --> 09:37.090
NICE ASSIST, ACE.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.590
AW, THANKS, DEUCE.
ACE WAS SURE RIGHT ABOUT YOU,

09:38.660 --> 09:40.000
EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU,

09:40.060 --> 09:41.770
BUT WE'RE SURE GLAD YOU'RE HERE
OR I WOULDN'T

09:41.830 --> 09:43.500
BE HERE TO BE GLAD
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

09:43.570 --> 09:44.830
REV, KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED

09:44.900 --> 09:47.170
FOR ANYTHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE BRAKES.

09:51.910 --> 09:53.340
HEY, HOW COME IT'S ME

09:53.410 --> 09:56.350
THAT'S ALWAYS GETTIN'
THE COW CUD KNOCKED OUT OF HIM?

09:56.410 --> 09:58.680
WHERE'S THAT GOLDARN TREASURE?

09:58.750 --> 10:00.620
ALL IN DUE COURSE, SAM.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.220
FIRST ACE'S SWORD,
THEN THE TREASURE.

10:03.290 --> 10:06.790
AND THEN I'LL TAKE CARE
OF FLOPPY EARS.

10:06.860 --> 10:09.190
HA HA HA HA HA!

10:10.560 --> 10:11.860
AW, FLOPPY EARS.

10:11.930 --> 10:13.360
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.560
YOU'RE NOT FOOLIN' NOBODY.

10:15.630 --> 10:17.530
YOU AND WHISKERS HERE
ARE IN CAHOOTS.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.540
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN YOU LOOK.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.070
YEAH, WELL,
I'D ALMOST HAVE TO BE.

10:22.140 --> 10:23.870
COME ON, SLAM.
LET'S GO TELL ACE.

10:23.940 --> 10:28.380
I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA HAVE TO
PUT YOUR LITTLE PLAN ON HOLD.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.250
WHOA!

10:30.310 --> 10:32.120
YOU THINK YOU GOT US?

10:33.650 --> 10:35.890
UNH! OK, YOU GOT US.

10:45.030 --> 10:48.330
THIS ISN'T LOOKING GOOD, REV.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.300
WE GOTTA BOLT.

10:49.370 --> 10:50.800
WE HAVE ONLY SECONDS

10:50.870 --> 10:53.270
BEFORE THE WORMHOLE CLOSES.

10:53.340 --> 10:54.800
YAAH!

10:56.340 --> 10:57.170
HUHH!

10:57.240 --> 10:58.140
YAAH!

11:01.980 --> 11:06.520
I'M SURE OUR LITTLE SECRET
WILL BE KEPT LONG ENOUGH.

11:06.580 --> 11:07.980
OHH!

11:08.050 --> 11:09.220
Ace: WHERE'S DUCK AND SLAM?

11:09.290 --> 11:11.650
I TRIED SAVING 'EM,
BUT WAS TOO LATE.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.860
THEY ENTERED
THE TIME-SPACE CONTINUUM.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.060
THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE,
AT ANY TIME.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.930
Duck: WE'RE DOOMED,
DOOMED, I TELL YOU!

11:22.000 --> 11:25.230
STUCK TO ROT IN A WORMHOLE,
LIKE--LIKE...

11:25.300 --> 11:26.200
WORMS.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.370
SLAM, WE GOTTA FIND

11:27.440 --> 11:28.540
SOMETHING TO EAT.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.470
WE COULD BE IN HERE
FOR A WHILE.

11:30.540 --> 11:31.640
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:31.710 --> 11:32.910
DOZENS OF CARS,

11:32.980 --> 11:35.080
AND NO FOOD AND NO TREASURE.

11:35.140 --> 11:38.150
THAT'S NOT FOOD.
THAT'S ROBO-JUNK.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.290
Ace: ACCORDING
TO TECH'S TRACKER,

11:49.360 --> 11:53.030
A WORMHOLE WILL OPEN UP HERE
FOR JUST A FEW MOMENTS.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.000
UNH!

12:00.070 --> 12:03.270
LOOKS LIKE YOU REACHED
THE END OF THE LINE, GREENHORN.

12:03.340 --> 12:07.180
PREPARE FOR
AN OLD-FASHIONED BUSHWHACKIN'.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.250
COME BACK HERE.

12:17.150 --> 12:18.050
UNH!

12:29.230 --> 12:30.170
AAH!

12:31.500 --> 12:33.600
ACE, YOUR SWORD!

12:33.670 --> 12:36.340
TOSS ME YOUR SWORD!

12:36.410 --> 12:37.340
ACE!

12:40.580 --> 12:41.510
THANKS, PAL.

12:41.580 --> 12:44.380
Sam, laughing: I CAN'T BELIEVE

12:44.450 --> 12:45.550
HE FELL FOR IT.

12:45.610 --> 12:47.080
HE'S EVEN DUMBER THAN ME.

12:47.150 --> 12:49.950
I'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME FOR THIS.

12:51.290 --> 12:53.490
AAH! OHH!

12:56.390 --> 12:58.360
UHH.

12:58.430 --> 12:59.400
AAH!

13:00.500 --> 13:02.830
GAAH!

13:04.600 --> 13:06.670
HOPE THERE'S
NO HARD FEELINGS,

13:06.740 --> 13:08.470
BUT ASK IF I CARE.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.370
GUARDIAN STRIKE SWORD!

13:11.440 --> 13:12.880
HUH?

13:14.710 --> 13:16.380
COME ON, SLAM.

13:16.450 --> 13:17.350
WHOA!

13:20.620 --> 13:21.280
HUH?

13:21.350 --> 13:22.320
UNH!

13:26.960 --> 13:29.460
ACE, WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T GIVE DEUCE YOUR SWORD.

13:29.530 --> 13:30.790
IT'S A SCAM.

13:30.860 --> 13:34.530
UH, BY THE WAY,
WHERE IS YOUR SWORD?

13:34.600 --> 13:35.800
THANKS, ACE.

13:35.870 --> 13:40.400
NOW I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.710
Sam: LET ME OUTTA HERE.

13:48.780 --> 13:50.410
I SAID LET ME OUT.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.520
THERE HASN'T BEEN A JAIL BUILT
THAT CAN HOLD OPHI--

13:53.580 --> 13:56.890
ODI--OBIBU--UH...

13:56.950 --> 13:58.390
UH, ME.

13:58.450 --> 13:59.860
LET ME OUT OF HERE.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.060
ZODAVIA, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.990
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO YOU
ABOUT DEUCE.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.860
AND I THOUGHT I WAS
THE ONLY ONE

14:05.930 --> 14:08.300
WHO EVER SCREWED UP
AROUND HERE.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.940
Zodavia: IT'S NOT ENTIRELY
YOUR FAULT, ACE.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.600
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
THE ENTIRE STORY.

14:14.670 --> 14:15.840
BACK ON FRELENG,

14:15.910 --> 14:16.910
DEUCE WAS ONCE ONE

14:16.970 --> 14:18.770
OF MY MOST POWERFUL GENERALS,

14:18.840 --> 14:19.940
WHO WAS DETERMINED TO LEAD

14:20.010 --> 14:22.380
THE GREATEST ARMY
EVER ASSEMBLED.

14:22.450 --> 14:25.310
BUT TENSIONS GREW BETWEEN US
WHEN I REFUSED

14:25.380 --> 14:28.050
TO PLACE ALL OF FRELENG
UNDER HIS COMMAND.

14:28.120 --> 14:32.220
DEUCE WAS ONLY INTERESTED
IN GLORY FOR HIMSELF.

14:32.290 --> 14:34.120
WHEN THE UPRISING TOOK PLACE,

14:34.190 --> 14:37.930
HE AND HIS ARMY WERE
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.900
SO AFTER ALL THAT,

14:39.960 --> 14:42.100
DEUCE CAME
ACROSS THE ENTIRE GALAXY

14:42.170 --> 14:43.730
JUST TO STEAL SOME TREASURE?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.570
WELL, THE JOKE'S ON HIM.

14:45.630 --> 14:47.800
SLAM AND I CHECKED THAT TRAIN
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,

14:47.870 --> 14:49.240
AND THERE AIN'T NO TREASURE.

14:49.310 --> 14:51.070
THE CARS ARE FILLED WITH NOTHING

14:51.140 --> 14:52.640
BUT BROKEN-DOWN ROBOTS,

14:52.710 --> 14:55.110
MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN EATEN.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.520
THAT'S IT. IT WAS
HIS ARMY HE WAS SEEKING,

15:00.580 --> 15:02.190
HIS ARMY OF ROBOTS.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.590
SO WHY DID HE TAKE
ACE'S SWORD?

15:04.650 --> 15:08.320
THAT SWORD ONCE BELONGED TO
THE GREATEST OF ALL WARRIORS,

15:08.390 --> 15:10.390
ONE OF THE GUARDIANS OF FRELENG.

15:10.460 --> 15:13.530
IT HOLDS POWERS
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.000
MY SWORD HAS POWERS?

15:15.060 --> 15:17.200
HOW COME YOU NEVER
TOLD ME THIS BEFORE?

15:17.270 --> 15:21.870
GREAT POWER USED TOO SOON
CAN CREATE AS MUCH HARM AS GOOD.

15:21.940 --> 15:24.970
IT WILL COME TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.310
I THINK I READ THAT
IN A FORTUNE COOKIE ONCE.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.250
DEUCE KNOWS THE POWERS
OF THE SWORD BETTER THAN ANYONE.

15:30.310 --> 15:31.610
WITHOUT TECH'S TRACKER,

15:31.680 --> 15:32.650
HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND

15:32.720 --> 15:33.650
DEUCE OR THE TRAIN?

15:33.720 --> 15:34.920
DEUCE HAS PROBABLY MAPPED

15:34.980 --> 15:36.690
WHERE THE WORMHOLES WILL APPEAR.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.020
ALL WE GOTTA DO IS FOLLOW

15:38.090 --> 15:41.190
THE ONE PERSON WHO KNOWS
WHERE TO FIND THEM.

15:42.230 --> 15:44.090
WON'T HE BE SUSPICIOUS

15:44.160 --> 15:45.630
IF WE JUST LET HIM GO?

15:45.690 --> 15:50.030
DESPERATE TIMES
CALL FOR DESPERATE MEASURES.

15:51.170 --> 15:53.100
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME WAY

15:53.170 --> 15:54.770
OUT OF THIS RATHOLE.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.170
OHH! WHAT THE SAM...

15:57.240 --> 15:58.510
AHA.

15:58.570 --> 16:02.580
SOMETIMES I'M SO SMART
I SCARES EVEN ME.

16:02.650 --> 16:04.750
YAAH!

16:08.780 --> 16:11.190
FREE AT LAST. FREE AT LAST.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.720
OLD SAMMY'S FREE AT LAST.

16:13.790 --> 16:17.190
HUH. THIS PLACE LOOKS FAMILIAR.

16:17.260 --> 16:18.190
OOH.

16:18.260 --> 16:20.130
OHH!

16:49.390 --> 16:50.490
HUH?

16:50.560 --> 16:51.760
LIKE I SAID,

16:51.830 --> 16:56.070
THERE AIN'T BEEN A JAIL BUILT
THAT CAN HOLD THE RED FOX.

16:57.770 --> 16:59.800
HYAH, MULE.

17:07.510 --> 17:09.280
Deuce: MY TRACKER SAYS WE'RE DUE

17:09.350 --> 17:11.250
FOR A WORMHOLE RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

17:12.650 --> 17:13.920
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

17:13.980 --> 17:16.020
WELL, I USED MY WITS
AND ESCAPED

17:16.090 --> 17:18.690
THEM LOWDOWN LOONEY-TICS.

17:18.750 --> 17:19.920
I SEE.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.820
THEY LET THE FOOL ESCAPE

17:21.890 --> 17:23.830
SO HE'D LEAD THEM TO ME.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.300
NO MATTER.
THEY CAN'T STOP ME NOW ANYWAY.

17:29.370 --> 17:31.670
Ace: YOU MIGHT AS WELL
FOLD YOUR HAND, DEUCE.

17:31.730 --> 17:32.970
IT'S ALL OVER.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.670
NO. IT'S ALL OVER FOR YOU.

17:36.740 --> 17:39.410
MMM, UNH! GOTCHA.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.340
GUARDIAN STRIKE SWORD!

17:45.950 --> 17:48.750
GUARDIAN SWORD, RIDE!

17:49.890 --> 17:51.790
Sam: SURE SHOWED THEM, HUH?

17:53.690 --> 17:56.230
HEY, I THINK
YOUR SPURS ARE UNTIED.

17:56.290 --> 17:58.530
OH. THANKS, DEUCEY.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.330
AAH!

18:00.400 --> 18:01.860
OHH, OHH, OHH, OHH.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.300
SOME OUTLAWS HAVE NO HONOR.

18:08.940 --> 18:10.270
NOW WHAT?

18:10.340 --> 18:11.540
I LOST THE SWORD.

18:11.610 --> 18:14.210
IT'S UP TO ME
TO GET IT BACK.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.790
HYAH!

18:24.850 --> 18:27.260
HEY, DEUCE, IS THIS
HOW YOU TREAT YOUR FRIENDS?

18:27.320 --> 18:30.930
I HAVE NO FRIENDS,
JUST VICTIMS.

18:30.990 --> 18:32.630
NYAH, HAH!

18:32.700 --> 18:34.260
UNH! VERY NICE.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.870
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
A CAREER AS A CARPENTER,

18:36.930 --> 18:40.170
WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE A FUTURE.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.470
ONCE I AWAKEN MY ARMY OF ROBOTS,

18:42.540 --> 18:47.180
I WILL CONQUER ALL WHO STAND
IN THE WAY OF MY SWORD.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.080
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
A FEW OF MY ASSOCIATES,

18:50.150 --> 18:53.380
THE FINEST ARMY IN THE UNIVERSE.

18:54.450 --> 18:56.290
OOH. NICE ROBO-ARMY.

18:56.350 --> 18:58.650
YOU MUST SAVE A FORTUNE
ON UNIFORMS.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.120
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A GALAXY TO CONQUER.

19:02.190 --> 19:05.630
OH, YEAH. RIP HIM TO PIECES.

19:44.330 --> 19:45.570
YOU AGAIN.

19:45.630 --> 19:46.770
STRIKE SWORD!

19:46.840 --> 19:48.800
YAAH! AHH.

19:48.870 --> 19:50.970
I NEVER THOUGHT
THE GREAT GENERAL DEUCE

19:51.040 --> 19:52.480
WOULD HIDE BEHIND A SWORD.

19:52.540 --> 19:55.710
SOON I WILL ACHIEVE MY GOAL
OF INTERGALACTIC GREATNESS

19:55.780 --> 19:58.980
AND REIGN SUPREME
ACROSS THE GALAXY.

19:59.050 --> 20:01.780
OH, YEAH. SORT OF
THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG THING.

20:01.850 --> 20:02.850
SO WHAT IS IT?

20:02.920 --> 20:04.820
ARE YOU AN EGG OR A CHICKEN?

20:04.890 --> 20:06.460
HUH

20:11.290 --> 20:12.960
AAH! OH, NO.

20:15.030 --> 20:16.430
YAAH!

20:20.440 --> 20:23.710
GUARDIAN STRIKE SWORD,
COME TO ME.

20:49.470 --> 20:51.270
IT'S ALL OVER, ACE.

20:51.330 --> 20:53.800
CAN'T SAY IT'S BEEN
A PLEASURE, DEUCE,

20:53.870 --> 20:56.470
'CAUSE IT HASN'T.

20:57.670 --> 20:59.740
HI-YAH!

20:59.810 --> 21:01.740
Zodavia: GREAT POWER
WILL COME TO YOU

21:01.810 --> 21:03.310
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

21:04.780 --> 21:08.580
OK, GUARDIAN STRIKE SWORD,
IT'S SHOWTIME.

21:09.790 --> 21:14.020
NOOOOO!

21:14.090 --> 21:16.730
HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT?
IT WORKS.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.660
OH.

21:28.900 --> 21:32.680
ONCE AGAIN, ACE,
YOU DID A MAGNIFICENT JOB.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.910
NOT ONLY DID YOU
RECOVER YOUR SWORD,

21:34.980 --> 21:37.450
BUT YOU PROVED YOURSELF
A TRUE WARRIOR

21:37.510 --> 21:39.620
WORTHY OF THE GUARDIANS
OF FRELENG.

21:39.680 --> 21:42.450
HEY, UH, ABOUT THE SWORD,
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME

21:42.520 --> 21:44.690
ALL ITS SECRETS
AND EVERYTHING IT CAN DO?

21:44.750 --> 21:49.020
IN TIME. TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE
CAN BE A DANGEROUS THING.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.760
SO CAN TOO LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.260
I MEAN, REALLY,
IT'S JUST A SWORD.

21:53.330 --> 21:55.130
YIIII!

21:55.200 --> 21:56.260
IS THERE A DRAFT IN HERE?

21:57.330 --> 21:58.200
VERY NICE.

21:58.270 --> 22:00.440
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

22:00.500 --> 22:02.870
HEY, EYES UP FRONT.

22:13.350 --> 22:16.750
* R-R-ROCK 'N' SET, LET'S JET *
