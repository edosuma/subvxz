00:01.140 --> 00:03.490
Previously on Damages...

00:04.360 --> 00:06.150
David and I had a fight.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.410
Did you contact my parents?

00:07.420 --> 00:08.720
They're on their way.

00:08.730 --> 00:09.940
And patty?

00:09.950 --> 00:13.570
We can't find her,but we're
still watching Tom Shayes.

00:13.580 --> 00:16.860
Bail is set at $1.5 million.

00:16.870 --> 00:18.010
Where are they taking her?

00:18.020 --> 00:19.300
Riker's island.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.030
We are doing everything that we can
to make your grandfather comfortable.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.450
You've been great.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.620
Lila. hey.

00:28.090 --> 00:31.240
Patty needs to know who got
in that limo with frobisher.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.040
I didn't know who he was
when we first saw him.

00:33.050 --> 00:34.330
What's his name?

00:34.340 --> 00:36.270
He set katie up to perjure herself.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.940
Who's pulling your strings,Gregory?

00:37.950 --> 00:40.790
This guy worked for
the sec for 20 years.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.800
He was a lead investigator who
tried to take down frobisher.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.490
Five years ago,I went
out on a limb for you.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.850
Gregory's a liability.
He's lost his nerve.

00:48.860 --> 00:50.210
We need a new strategy,arthur.

00:50.220 --> 00:51.620
So find one.

00:51.630 --> 00:56.220
I'd like to bring in a specialist,help
prepare you for the deposition.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.240
Mr.Malina's life was threatened.

00:58.250 --> 01:01.410
It's quite possible that
the other side got to him.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.200
You need to disappear.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.180
I cannot protect you.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.310
Without gregory malina,we're
going to lose the case.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.360
Please don't do this.

01:38.370 --> 01:40.760
I don't want this life.

01:40.770 --> 01:42.650
David.

01:43.110 --> 01:44.650
We're done.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.810
He called off the engagement?

01:52.820 --> 01:55.070
Maybe we went too far.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.310
Do you regret what we did?

02:03.370 --> 02:06.190
6 weeks earlier

02:31.470 --> 02:32.730
Cocoa.

03:25.650 --> 03:27.140
Katie,katie,it's me.

03:27.150 --> 03:28.120
Get out of here!

03:28.130 --> 03:29.280
Katie,please.

03:29.290 --> 03:32.160
Get away from me,gregory,or
I will call the police!

04:17.060 --> 04:20.430
Nothing would make me happier than
to help take down arthur frobisher.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.720
Thank you for meeting
with us again,mr.Moore.

04:22.730 --> 04:27.170
I know it's frustrating,but there was simply
no proof that frobisher did anything wrong.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.290
But you think he did?

04:29.750 --> 04:31.220
Who doesn't?

04:31.230 --> 04:34.720
Dumping his stock,accounting
irregularities.

04:34.730 --> 04:37.060
I really wish I could be more helpful.

04:37.070 --> 04:41.840
In the meantime,if you want to
talk strategy,I'm at your disposal.

04:41.850 --> 04:44.710
- Well,there was one other thing we wanted to ask you about.
- Sure.

04:45.300 --> 04:49.140
Uh,we were wondering about one
of frobisher's shareholders.

04:49.150 --> 04:51.560
Does that name mean anything to you?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.420
Gregory malina.

04:54.430 --> 04:56.710
Doesn't ring a bell.

04:57.010 --> 04:59.550
But let me make some calls.
I'll see what I can find.

04:59.900 --> 05:04.060
If there's one thing arthur frobisher
is good at,it's tying up loose ends.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.680
All right,I'll see you soon,okay?

05:09.010 --> 05:10.250
Hey--
geez.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.880
- David,hey.
- Lila.

05:11.890 --> 05:13.670
You know what? You
rescheduled your rotation.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.280
I almost missed you.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.340
That would have sucked.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.310
Is everything okay,or.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.760
- Um,I sold the defibrillator,and you were amazingly helpful.
- Oh,good.

05:23.770 --> 05:26.390
Which is why I'm going
to take you to dinner.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.720
as a thank-you.

05:27.730 --> 05:28.980
It's a little italian place.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.920
Lila,I'm sorry.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.110
I've got to pass on that.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.290
Why?

05:34.300 --> 05:35.850
You know why.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.280
It's just dinner.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.800
It is not just dinner,and you know that.

05:42.380 --> 05:46.230
Look,your grandfather was sick.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.970
I was the doctor who was trying to help him.
It's very common for emotions to get mixed up.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.900
My emotions aren't mixed up.

05:51.910 --> 05:55.660
Lila,we have talked about this.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.300
I'm not available.

06:05.860 --> 06:08.610
Gregory malina owned frobisher stock?

06:08.620 --> 06:09.880
I don't know what you're talking.

06:09.890 --> 06:12.290
Is there anything you
didn't do for that kid?

06:12.300 --> 06:14.540
Gregory worked for me. That's all.

06:14.550 --> 06:15.880
Save it,ray.

06:15.890 --> 06:18.870
I wouldn't give a shit about
your pathetic schoolgirl crush.

06:18.880 --> 06:22.580
- You watch yourself!
- But I'm not gonna let your bullshit take me down.

06:24.110 --> 06:26.130
Malina emptied his bank account.

06:26.940 --> 06:29.200
He's back in the states.
Did you know that?

06:32.360 --> 06:33.760
So what do you want from me?

06:33.770 --> 06:36.370
I want you on my team.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.440
I don't understand.

06:38.450 --> 06:43.070
I don't like you,ray,but I realized
an amazing thing on the way over here.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.610
You're not my problem. Arthur is.

06:45.620 --> 06:46.430
Look,I have a duty.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.740
Patty hewes is a ball's hair away
from breaking this thing wide open.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.750
So I'm going to do
what you couldn't,ray.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.160
What is that?

06:54.170 --> 06:56.280
Put an end to this thing.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.820
The sec has been a dead end so far.

07:01.830 --> 07:05.050
But mr.Moore is looking into
gregory malina's stock sale.

07:05.060 --> 07:08.970
Good,because gregory's back in play.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.770
What did you find?

07:10.780 --> 07:14.720
When frobisher told larry popler
that gregory malina was alive.

07:15.990 --> 07:18.070
he was telling the truth.

07:19.270 --> 07:21.100
A flight manifest?

07:21.110 --> 07:24.660
The day gregory disappeared,he was
booked on a plane to mexico city.

07:24.670 --> 07:26.250
Outside the reach of the court.

07:26.260 --> 07:29.740
There was no sign of him until
he used his credit card yesterday.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.920
He rented a car about 40 miles
north of the border in alamogordo.

07:33.930 --> 07:36.610
Any idea why he'd come back?

07:37.020 --> 07:39.600
When is the last time
you spoke to katie?

07:39.610 --> 07:41.940
Not since she went back home.

07:42.310 --> 07:44.950
That could be it. He felt
bad about setting her up.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.410
He tried to call her after
he burned her as a witness.

07:47.420 --> 07:49.020
Get in touch with her.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.020
I got one of these in the mail,too.

08:33.030 --> 08:34.429
You going to this thing?

08:34.440 --> 08:37.530
The gala for the blind justice project?

08:37.539 --> 08:38.940
No,I'm not.

08:38.950 --> 08:42.230
Says patty hewes is
giving the keynote speech.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.830
Could be interesting.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.380
Art,don't even think about it.

08:46.390 --> 08:48.120
You're not going.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.660
nancy,it's good to see you.

08:53.670 --> 08:54.330
Good to see you.

08:54.340 --> 08:55.460
This is art.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.810
Thank you for coming in.

08:56.820 --> 08:58.120
Pleasure.

08:58.360 --> 08:58.880
Please.

08:58.890 --> 09:01.430
- Yeah,let's,uh,sit down there.
- All right.

09:02.130 --> 09:07.190
So,ray says you're the best out
there at,uh,well,preparing a witness.

09:07.650 --> 09:09.330
I hope I can help.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.700
Good.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.740
So,uh.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.670
.what exactly are we gonna do?

09:14.680 --> 09:18.040
Do you ever sing around the
house? Maybe in the shower?

09:18.960 --> 09:19.920
Nope.

09:19.930 --> 09:21.020
Oh,come on.

09:21.980 --> 09:23.200
I hum.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.880
This exercise will help you relax.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.420
you want to look for
a way in,not a way out.

09:33.610 --> 09:36.320
I'd do a lot better
with simon and garfunkel.

09:36.330 --> 09:38.140
You can do whatever you want,

09:38.150 --> 09:42.680
but you're going to have to look comfortable answering
patty's questions about corporate malfeasance,

09:42.690 --> 09:48.660
about accounting irregularities and about why
you stole the life savings of 5,000 people.

09:52.580 --> 09:55.220
That might be easier than singing.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.170
All right.

10:04.850 --> 10:07.560
Yes,mom,I'm fine.

10:08.730 --> 10:09.880
How's montreal?

10:09.890 --> 10:12.290
Montreal is great but
I left my video camera.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.120
Yeah,I know.

10:13.130 --> 10:15.510
Dad left a message. He left it behind.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.390
He didn't give me an address,though.
Where do you want me to send it?

10:19.320 --> 10:20.630
hold on,mom; that's your phone.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.280
okay,dear. You can answer it.

10:23.650 --> 10:24.820
Hello?

10:24.830 --> 10:26.080
Katie?

10:26.350 --> 10:28.490
Katie,it's ellen. I've been trying.

10:29.370 --> 10:30.540
shit.

10:42.620 --> 10:45.940
Ms.Parsons.Ms.Parsons.

10:51.850 --> 10:53.470
Mr.Moore.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.260
Please get in.

11:04.190 --> 11:06.340
Look,I want to help you.

11:06.790 --> 11:12.720
I wasted years of my life going after frobisher,and
my hands were tied every step of the way.

11:13.860 --> 11:15.210
Why?

11:15.220 --> 11:16.510
Why?

11:16.520 --> 11:19.730
Because the man has
friends in high places.

11:20.550 --> 11:25.670
But I know things,information that
we couldn't use in the government case

11:25.680 --> 11:29.510
that would be invaluable to
patty hewes in a civil trial.

11:30.430 --> 11:31.820
Like what?

11:31.830 --> 11:34.120
I sit on boards,ms.Parsons.

11:34.130 --> 11:36.760
I advise political campaigns.

11:36.770 --> 11:39.140
I will not go public.

11:39.780 --> 11:43.430
If you call me as a witness,I'll lie.

11:43.960 --> 11:44.620
Mr.Moore.

11:44.630 --> 11:46.920
Frobisher is a powerful man.

11:46.930 --> 11:48.700
You want my help?

11:48.710 --> 11:50.760
That's the deal.

11:50.770 --> 11:52.800
Talk to your boss.

12:01.350 --> 12:06.160
But for now,start by
looking into arlington.

12:31.790 --> 12:33.600
I have bad news.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.270
What?

12:37.280 --> 12:39.020
It's confirmed.

12:39.030 --> 12:40.600
What is?

12:40.610 --> 12:42.360
You've lost your mind.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.030
Your keys.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.620
How is that possible?

12:47.630 --> 12:50.030
You must've had a psychotic break.

12:50.850 --> 12:51.870
Oh,my god.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.440
You know what you need?

12:54.800 --> 12:58.060
A weekend at the beach,the hamptons.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.260
You serious?

12:59.270 --> 13:01.310
Tom told me about a great place.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.550
I think if we don't get
away,i may lose you forever.

13:05.540 --> 13:08.340
********

13:08.350 --> 13:10.240
Yes**

13:14.560 --> 13:17.470
And these were the spvs
that you had created?

13:17.480 --> 13:23.870
Yes,I think in our country,the
more popular term is spe.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.110
Spe?

13:25.120 --> 13:26.850
That's right,spe.

13:26.860 --> 13:29.230
Special purpose entity.

13:29.240 --> 13:33.460
And aren't these spes commonly
incorporated toward illegitimate ends?

13:33.470 --> 13:34.110
No

13:34.120 --> 13:36.890
The hiding*******

13:36.900 --> 13:39.720
Do you have a question or are you
just trying to ruin our concentration?

13:39.730 --> 13:40.230
Neither.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.490
George moore came to see me last night.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.590
Where?

13:45.870 --> 13:47.520
Outside my apartment.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.190
He met with you alone?

13:51.650 --> 13:54.430
He wants to help us off the record.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.580
How?

13:55.590 --> 13:57.780
Arlington. He told me to look into it.

13:59.300 --> 14:00.870
Arlington,virginia.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.480
Some girl was killed in a car crash.

14:03.490 --> 14:04.690
It was frobisher's car.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.620
It was 25 years ago. It's old news.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.120
There were conflicting accounts.

14:08.130 --> 14:12.300
But the official police report backed
frobisher's story that the girl was driving.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.160
Yeah,it did,but i ran a history.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.450
And in the last 25 years,

14:15.460 --> 14:20.320
the girl's family went from living in a trailer
park to being the biggest landowner in arlington.

14:20.710 --> 14:23.150
So you think frobisher's
paying people off?

14:23.160 --> 14:25.050
He screws up,he buys silence.

14:25.060 --> 14:28.160
Katie,gregory,it's frobisher's M.O.

14:28.170 --> 14:31.790
That won't help us in the
deposition unless we can back it up.

14:31.800 --> 14:36.690
I want to meet with moore again,push
him further,work the relationship.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.650
All right.

14:38.900 --> 14:39.830
I'll go with you.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.630
No,wrong move,tom.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.010
He approached ellen
alone,that's the way he wants it.

14:57.350 --> 14:59.730
Just hear me out,please.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.630
Hanson police department,please.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.280
There's a warrant out for my arrest.

15:06.290 --> 15:07.750
Yes,it's an emergency.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.860
You talk to the police,they're gonna send me
back to new york and frobisher will kill me.

15:15.370 --> 15:17.330
I'm not running anymore.

15:17.340 --> 15:19.110
You can do whatever you want.

15:25.050 --> 15:28.500
You tell me one lie,and
I will cut your dick off.

15:39.350 --> 15:40.760
Ms.Parsons?

15:41.460 --> 15:42.200
Yes?

15:42.210 --> 15:45.850
I'm sorry to bother you,but
we really need to talk.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.930
I'm sorry,what is this in reference to?

15:49.370 --> 15:51.360
Your fiance.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.470
What about him?

15:54.480 --> 15:56.860
I think we're gonna
want to talk privately.

16:00.730 --> 16:04.340
Everything that happened
to you was my fault.

16:04.940 --> 16:09.580
The only reason why you got involved in any of this
was because I brought you to the condo that night.

16:09.950 --> 16:13.770
Ray fiske gave me a thousand shares of
frobisher's stock to go down to florida,

16:13.780 --> 16:15.760
rent the condo in my name.

16:15.770 --> 16:17.520
What for?

16:17.920 --> 16:20.160
At the time,I had no idea.

16:20.170 --> 16:21.840
I didn't ask-- it
was a lot of money.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.090
I was broke.

16:24.100 --> 16:27.520
But it turns out that frobisher was going
to meet with some guy from the government.

16:27.530 --> 16:28.730
Who?

16:28.740 --> 16:31.570
I. I can't tell you that.

16:31.580 --> 16:34.490
It would put you at
too much risk,trust me.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.310
But this whole thing started
because he thought that you saw him.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.050
But I didn'T.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.680
I told them that,but
they didn't believe me.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.750
So they just try to buy
me off with a restaurant.

16:49.350 --> 16:51.180
But they kept postponing it.

16:52.870 --> 16:55.620
They had to keep you quiet
during the government trial.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.900
And what about you? How long
have you been on their payroll?

17:08.510 --> 17:12.990
A few weeks after florida,they hooked
me up with a job at the consulting firm.

17:13.690 --> 17:15.609
And who was the guy in the limo?

17:15.619 --> 17:16.839
I have no idea.

17:16.849 --> 17:20.040
Once you started talking to patty hewes,they
just needed to burn you as a witness.

17:20.050 --> 17:23.130
So they gave you luke
richards' name to set me up.

17:23.140 --> 17:24.900
They used us both.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.430
And we let them.

17:26.440 --> 17:30.040
These guys have all the power,

17:30.050 --> 17:33.530
and they're convinced
everyone's out to get them.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.090
How do you know david,ms.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.640
Uh,dimeo.Lila dimeo.

17:46.650 --> 17:50.830
I met him at the hospital--
he was treating my grandfather.

17:51.740 --> 17:55.290
And what exactly can I
help you with,ms.Dimeo?

17:56.260 --> 17:58.890
God,I'm a terrible liar.

17:59.860 --> 18:02.400
I'm not here about david.

18:02.650 --> 18:05.440
Then why are you here?

18:05.450 --> 18:07.460
I'm here about you.

18:07.830 --> 18:10.600
David doesn't love you anymore.

18:13.130 --> 18:14.690
Excuse me?

18:14.700 --> 18:16.790
Who are you?

18:16.800 --> 18:20.360
I must seem crazy,but I
thought you should know.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.400
I've been sleeping with him.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.110
I think you better leave.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.930
Ellen,there's no point in getting mad.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.160
You need to leave.

18:29.170 --> 18:31.930
We can't change how we feel.

18:33.660 --> 18:34.830
What are you doing?

18:35.460 --> 18:36.520
Security.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.210
Fifth floor,hewes and associates.

18:38.220 --> 18:38.860
Ellen.

18:38.870 --> 18:40.720
Ellen parsons' office.

18:41.110 --> 18:42.860
I feel sorry for you.

18:44.070 --> 18:46.100
Right away,thank you.

18:47.030 --> 18:49.030
You didn't deserve this.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.910
Why weren't you at my arraignment?

19:05.920 --> 19:06.740
I tried.

19:06.750 --> 19:10.520
I tried,but with everything
that's been going on.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.140
- ellen.
- What?

19:14.600 --> 19:16.650
What happened with you and patty?

19:17.210 --> 19:19.710
I know that you're not
telling me everything.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.530
He called off the engagement?

19:30.900 --> 19:33.300
Maybe we went too far.

19:36.790 --> 19:39.100
Do you regret what we did?

19:45.980 --> 19:48.450
So there's bourbon in the kitchen.

19:48.460 --> 19:50.300
And remember to walk cory.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.940
Where can I reach you?

19:51.950 --> 19:52.990
I'll be at the beach house.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.620
Tom has the number.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.470
Storm cleared montauk last night.
Should be a perfect weekend.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.800
Thank you,perry.

19:58.810 --> 20:00.260
Ellen.

20:00.270 --> 20:02.690
everything's going to be all right.

20:46.390 --> 20:48.420
That's insane. She is crazy,ellen.

20:48.430 --> 20:49.740
Who is she?

20:49.750 --> 20:53.200
Her name is lila dimeo.

20:53.700 --> 20:56.610
She's lying-- we did
not sleep together.

20:56.870 --> 20:59.120
She said that you
treated her grandfather.

20:59.130 --> 21:00.700
Yeah,I did.

21:00.710 --> 21:03.200
I met her at the hospital.

21:03.210 --> 21:05.850
But then her grandfather was released.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.140
And did you see her after that?

21:07.150 --> 21:08.070
No.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.750
Well. yes.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.030
no. yeah.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.490
Yes or no?

21:14.470 --> 21:18.660
She had this medical equipment that she
wanted to sell,so I took a look at it for her.

21:19.020 --> 21:19.950
What?

21:19.960 --> 21:23.910
She asked me to price
a defibrillator for her.

21:25.110 --> 21:26.640
Where?

21:27.190 --> 21:28.890
At her apartment.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.430
So you were at her apartment?

21:30.440 --> 21:32.690
What the hell were you
doing at her apartment?

21:32.700 --> 21:36.220
I just,I gave her a price and
that's it. Nothing happened.

21:36.230 --> 21:38.180
Then why are you so uncomfortable?

21:38.190 --> 21:40.540
Because I feel like you're
accusing me of something.

21:40.550 --> 21:44.210
David,a woman came into my office today
and told me that she was sleeping with you.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.790
Listen to me.

21:46.220 --> 21:47.210
I hardly know her.

21:47.220 --> 21:49.800
Clearly,the woman is nuts.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.360
Well,stay away from her.

21:51.370 --> 21:53.390
Tell her to stay away from me.

21:59.390 --> 22:01.940
Patty hewes knows about arlington.

22:01.950 --> 22:03.040
How in hell did.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.250
I told her associate.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.400
Aw,jesus!

22:07.410 --> 22:11.250
The last thing arthur wants is for
that shit to come out in a deposition.

22:11.260 --> 22:14.290
That is a mighty risky
game you're playing.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.520
Relax.

22:15.530 --> 22:17.360
Arlington's all his.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.620
You and I have nothing to do with that.

22:19.630 --> 22:25.100
And when that asshole finds out that
patty hewes knowsut he'll have to settle.

22:26.910 --> 22:29.110
Just shut up and play your part.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.270
- Ms.Hewes.
- Chin.

22:41.750 --> 22:45.270
- I was stunned when I learned.
- Elbows off the table.

22:48.520 --> 22:54.560
Ms.Hewes,I was stunned when I learned that
the accounting firm had defrauded my company.

22:54.570 --> 22:56.830
Don't blink when you say that.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.270
You were stunned?

23:01.870 --> 23:03.500
Why is that?

23:03.510 --> 23:06.440
I mean,you-you cashed out just in time.

23:06.450 --> 23:08.880
You walked away with millions.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.760
I gave that company everything I had.

23:15.190 --> 23:16.980
and I failed.

23:17.450 --> 23:19.410
my employees.

23:21.980 --> 23:23.770
my family.

23:24.220 --> 23:28.400
I failed pretty much everyone
who ever believed in me.

23:30.990 --> 23:32.700
Bullshit.

23:32.710 --> 23:35.790
Stop making speeches.
You're trying too hard.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.280
Bullshit?

23:40.890 --> 23:42.610
Don't you tell me bullshit.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.810
- You have no idea what I've been through.
- Art.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.560
Art.

23:46.570 --> 23:48.900
This is why she's here.

23:50.710 --> 23:52.300
Don't tell me bullshit.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.740
People expect a ceo to be strong.

24:00.620 --> 24:04.700
They see too much of the
soft side,looks like an act.

24:05.420 --> 24:09.000
You've got to be heartfelt
without sounding like a pussy.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.320
Now,you think you can do that?

24:20.700 --> 24:21.930
All right.

24:22.390 --> 24:23.960
All right,fair enough.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.350
Let's do this again.

24:32.360 --> 24:35.720
Since when does the sec
investigate car accidents?

24:35.730 --> 24:37.930
I'm not going to give you everything.

24:38.660 --> 24:39.720
Okay.

24:39.730 --> 24:43.290
Cindy lambert died in
a car crash in 1983.

24:43.300 --> 24:46.720
Frobisher said he wasn't driving,and
the lambert family backed him up.

24:46.730 --> 24:49.700
- And now they're very rich.
- Is that so?

24:50.120 --> 24:53.480
So I'm guessing the lambert
family was given frobisher stock.

24:54.340 --> 24:58.040
If the sec knew this,why didn't
they use it in the criminal trial?

24:58.050 --> 25:00.690
The judge excluded it on relevance.

25:00.700 --> 25:04.670
We were going after frobisher for
insider trading and accounting fraud.

25:05.710 --> 25:07.640
What are you getting out of this?

25:07.650 --> 25:11.040
I tried to take frobisher
down and I failed.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.540
I still want justice. No.

25:14.550 --> 25:16.150
If you did,you'd go public.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.190
I think you have other reasons.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.100
What happened between you two,mr.Moore?

25:21.110 --> 25:23.520
Did frobisher block
your political career?

25:23.530 --> 25:25.460
Blackball you from his country club?

25:25.470 --> 25:26.830
Sleep with your wife?

25:26.840 --> 25:28.740
You have the truth.

25:28.750 --> 25:30.980
Now use it against him.

25:32.250 --> 25:35.860
Patty hewes doesn't like
surprises or hidden agendas.

25:36.530 --> 25:38.790
I better not find out you have one.

25:45.070 --> 25:47.340
Why did you tell me
that you were married?

25:48.750 --> 25:50.850
It was their idea.

25:50.860 --> 25:53.280
So you wouldn't tell anyone about us.

25:53.290 --> 25:57.300
And after florida,when you
helped me with all of that stuff,

25:58.020 --> 26:00.590
was that all a part of the setup,too?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.180
No.

26:02.190 --> 26:03.750
That was me.

26:06.900 --> 26:10.620
This is gonna sound crazy. I know.

26:11.430 --> 26:15.400
what I did to
you,katie,is unforgiveable.

26:16.510 --> 26:18.530
but I liked you.

26:19.020 --> 26:22.410
I've always liked you.

26:23.350 --> 26:26.050
When I was in mexico
hiding,I-i thought.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.610
I just.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.100
I just wanted to see you again.

26:35.350 --> 26:38.210
I thought.

26:38.220 --> 26:40.650
maybe if we spoke,if I.

26:41.060 --> 26:46.080
if I could just explain things,then
maybe-maybe we could just.

26:52.650 --> 26:55.140
You ruined my life.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.100
- Hello?
- Hey.

27:37.050 --> 27:38.370
It's me.

27:40.690 --> 27:43.430
I know I shouldn't be calling.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.060
I just wanted to say I've realized.

27:48.150 --> 27:50.250
I was wrong back then.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.590
Well.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.960
you were?

27:55.350 --> 27:57.020
Yeah.

27:57.670 --> 27:59.320
To let you.

27:59.900 --> 28:02.070
expect more from me.

28:04.650 --> 28:08.690
You know,the last time I saw you,you
told me it was too late to change.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.780
It's not.

28:12.530 --> 28:14.790
You can change.

28:15.310 --> 28:17.630
And you can withdraw from the case,ray.

28:18.290 --> 28:21.110
Cut those guys off. All
they do is hurt people.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.870
It's not that simple.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.760
It is. You're not like them.

28:28.850 --> 28:31.160
I know you want to do the right thing.

28:34.290 --> 28:37.110
I'm sorry,gregory.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.010
For everything.

28:43.570 --> 28:45.450
Take care,ray.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.670
The hotel's totally booked.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.970
I don't know where we can
go on such short notice.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.110
This is your first weekend off in what.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.260
Forever.

29:14.270 --> 29:15.760
So ask for the beach house.

29:15.770 --> 29:17.000
Ask who?

29:17.010 --> 29:18.430
Patty.

29:18.810 --> 29:19.800
No,thanks.

29:21.220 --> 29:23.480
Mr.Moore insists on total anonymity.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.270
We'll never get him to testify.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.800
I question the guy's motives.

29:28.230 --> 29:29.730
That's all right.

29:29.740 --> 29:33.760
If we can confirm that the lambert
family was given frobisher stock,

29:33.770 --> 29:36.420
we can use it against
frobisher in the deposition.

29:36.430 --> 29:37.410
Good.

29:37.420 --> 29:39.310
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.930
Ellen wants to use your beach house.

29:42.940 --> 29:44.420
No. I was just.

29:44.430 --> 29:46.470
She wants to go away for thweekend.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.470
Be my guest.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.780
Thank you,but i couldn't possibly.

29:49.790 --> 29:52.220
Ellen,it's just sitting there empty.

29:52.230 --> 29:55.090
I have the gala this weekend.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.220
Well,okay. Thank you.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.570
Get the keys from uncle pete.

30:06.140 --> 30:08.890
I've been trying to reach
patty. She won't call me back.

30:09.510 --> 30:11.390
Go to the beach house.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.940
I will,I will.

30:12.950 --> 30:13.810
But,ellen.

30:13.820 --> 30:16.220
Go to the beach house,tom.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.340
Patty,it's me again.

30:29.670 --> 30:32.330
You need to call me back.

30:39.460 --> 30:40.800
Patty?

30:44.820 --> 30:46.120
Patty?

30:58.400 --> 30:59.810
Ah,tommy!

31:00.520 --> 31:02.160
Didn't hear you coming.

31:02.170 --> 31:03.710
Have you seen patty?

31:04.100 --> 31:05.810
I was gonna ask you.

31:06.470 --> 31:08.470
I need the keys to the beach house.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.380
My name is gregory malina.

32:02.780 --> 32:05.560
I've made this tape because right now,

32:06.450 --> 32:11.250
I don't trust anyone and I want
to make sure my story gets out.

32:15.170 --> 32:19.300
In 2002,I met ray fiske.

32:20.210 --> 32:24.450
I didn't know it at the time,but
he was arthur frobisher's lawyer.

32:26.720 --> 32:31.030
Shortly after,mr.Fiske sent me down
to florida to help set up a meeting.

32:33.100 --> 32:35.850
I didn't know what
this meeting was about,

32:36.360 --> 32:42.400
but I know that arthur frobisher was in contact with
a member of the securities and exchange commission.

32:46.290 --> 32:50.980
The name of that member is george moore.

32:55.810 --> 32:58.100
Ah,keys to the castle,my lady.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.360
Ah,thanks,pete.

32:59.370 --> 33:01.170
And your chariot.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.270
What's this?

33:02.280 --> 33:04.420
Patty heard you're renting
a car and she won't have it.

33:04.430 --> 33:06.380
Insists that you take hers.

33:06.390 --> 33:07.980
Thank you.

33:36.190 --> 33:38.590
What's the matter,boy? Need to go out?

33:39.090 --> 33:42.390
You were right about
lila dimeo; she's nuts.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.650
What do you mean?

33:44.230 --> 33:46.010
I did a background on her.

33:46.020 --> 33:49.240
Sophomore year,she got kicked out of
college for stalking her professor,

33:49.250 --> 33:52.520
and since then,she's had three
restraining orders put on her.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.250
Jesus.

33:54.260 --> 33:56.470
Stay away from her,david.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.110
Cocoa,cocoa!

34:14.880 --> 34:16.100
Come on boy

34:20.270 --> 34:21.929
Coco Coco

34:24.469 --> 34:26.449
stay. Good dog.

34:56.510 --> 34:58.200
Gregory?

35:19.860 --> 35:21.260
oh,my god.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.350
Holy shit.

35:38.660 --> 35:40.650
Gregory?

35:48.860 --> 35:50.130
It's done.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.620
It was katie connor's area code.

35:55.100 --> 35:56.720
You were right.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.160
Good.

36:32.460 --> 36:34.180
Oh,my god!

36:34.190 --> 36:35.920
*********

36:35.930 --> 36:37.690
I can't******

36:39.360 --> 36:40.540
Come here.

36:43.460 --> 36:44.920
Come on

36:47.190 --> 36:48.370
Arlington?

36:48.380 --> 36:49.860
She's gonna dredge up that shit?

36:49.870 --> 36:51.760
I thought we had it sealed!

36:51.770 --> 36:54.120
Well,patty's people came to me.

36:54.130 --> 36:56.310
They know the family owns stock.

36:56.320 --> 36:59.090
Patty's gonna say you paid him off.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.280
You know something? I don't give a shit.

37:02.290 --> 37:03.880
You know what? I'll handle it.

37:04.150 --> 37:09.330
You know,arlington,katie connor,gregory
malina-- let her depose me.

37:09.340 --> 37:10.670
We're going to trial,ray.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.260
No,we're not.

37:12.270 --> 37:15.650
It's not even relevant! That was
25 years ago,for christ's sake!

37:15.660 --> 37:17.230
It has nothing to do with this trial!

37:17.240 --> 37:21.380
Patty gets it into the deposition,she'll
undermine your credibility.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.250
Burden of proof's lower
in a civil trial,art.

37:24.260 --> 37:27.590
Fact is,she'll use it
to establish an M.O.

37:28.190 --> 37:33.150
She'll say it proves you have a
history of buying off witnesses.

37:35.130 --> 37:37.070
You got to settle.

37:37.910 --> 37:38.940
He's right,arthur.

37:38.950 --> 37:41.330
I heard him,george.

37:46.490 --> 37:48.170
What are you gonna do?

37:52.610 --> 37:57.370
When the blind justice project asked me to
present this award tonight to richard lamontagne,

37:57.380 --> 38:00.170
I didn't know what to say.

38:00.180 --> 38:04.520
Not because I was flattered,but
because I didn't even know who he was.

38:05.440 --> 38:09.480
so I googled him,and you might
be surprised to learn that richie,

38:09.490 --> 38:13.700
in his youth,won three atv
motocross championships.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.240
I mean,I was.

38:15.250 --> 38:18.200
until i realized I
spelled his name wrong.

38:19.810 --> 38:25.590
How is it that a woman who's argued cases before
the supreme court hates to give a speech in public?

38:25.600 --> 38:31.010
There are nine people on the supreme court
and only six are awake on any given day.

38:31.020 --> 38:33.080
Excuse me. May I?

38:34.800 --> 38:36.420
- Okay.
- Thank you.

38:37.770 --> 38:39.460
Patty hewes.

38:40.380 --> 38:41.940
Shall we?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.560
I caught you on tv last week.

38:49.310 --> 38:51.760
You don't like me very much,do you?

38:51.770 --> 38:53.780
Why would you say that?

38:54.370 --> 38:57.480
But why should you? You
don't really know me.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.370
So that's why you're here.

39:03.090 --> 39:06.940
I'm here because I'm
willing to negotiate.

39:07.510 --> 39:10.540
There's nothing to negotiate.
This isn't about money.

39:10.730 --> 39:13.220
Oh,no,no,no,of course not.

39:13.820 --> 39:16.850
I know you don't give a
shit about justice,patty.

39:16.860 --> 39:18.900
So what do you want?

39:18.910 --> 39:21.720
I want you disgraced.

39:22.640 --> 39:26.310
I want history to erase
your every achievement.

39:26.830 --> 39:32.520
I want you to feel the disgust in your
children's eyes when they look on you in shame.

39:36.130 --> 39:40.350
Well,this has been lovely.

39:43.430 --> 39:46.060
It's rude to abandon a
girl on the dance floor.

39:46.070 --> 39:48.140
The song's over,patty.

39:48.150 --> 39:51.750
Almost as bad as abandoning
a girl in a burning car.

39:57.610 --> 39:58.500
All right.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.550
.let's get this over with,shall we?

40:05.030 --> 40:06.640
$300 million.

40:06.650 --> 40:11.290
Must have been horrible; her face
smashed clear through the windshield.

40:13.070 --> 40:15.110
$450 million.

40:15.120 --> 40:20.150
Blood everywhere,gasoline,searing heat.

40:20.160 --> 40:23.030
I'm told that you never forget
the smell of burning flesh.

40:23.040 --> 40:26.040
$850 million,that's my final offer.

40:26.050 --> 40:28.660
Did she shout out your
name when she died?

40:28.670 --> 40:29.930
Arthur!

40:30.470 --> 40:31.540
Arthur?

40:32.550 --> 40:34.030
Arthur?

40:34.880 --> 40:36.350
Arthur

40:38.740 --> 40:40.350
Coffee's ready.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.790
Or do you just want to call it a night?

40:46.840 --> 40:48.240
No.

40:50.540 --> 40:52.310
No,sorry.

40:54.600 --> 40:57.720
No,I want you to keep
playing patty hewes.

41:16.110 --> 41:18.860
6 WEEKS LATER

41:30.100 --> 41:31.450
Patty?

41:35.570 --> 41:37.210
Patty?

42:22.920 --> 42:25.360
Patty,it's me again.

42:27.050 --> 42:29.720
Where the hell are you?
