¶¶

00:03.637 --> 00:06.605
(theme music playing)

00:08.542 --> 00:11.610
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:11.612 --> 00:14.380
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.382 --> 00:20.152
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:22.554
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowin' through ¶</i>

00:22.556 --> 00:27.559
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>

00:27.561 --> 00:30.496
<i> ¶ And I'll get there I swear ¶</i>

00:30.498 --> 00:34.566
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:43.577 --> 00:45.544
(geese honking)

00:52.319 --> 00:54.319
(wind whistling)

00:55.523 --> 00:57.589
Oh, my!

01:04.498 --> 01:06.465
(cawing)

01:08.335 --> 01:09.568
(laughs)

01:12.406 --> 01:14.373
Hands up!
This is a holdup.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.208
Whoa! What's that
on the cracker?

01:16.210 --> 01:17.543
Caviar?

01:17.545 --> 01:20.612
(horses neighing)

01:23.384 --> 01:25.484
Come on!
Throw it here!

01:33.260 --> 01:34.293
Ooh!

01:34.295 --> 01:35.494
May I?

01:37.465 --> 01:39.465
Enchanté.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.266
-(smacks)
-(grunts)

01:43.637 --> 01:45.704
Ha! Sorry, fellas!

01:45.706 --> 01:47.372
Baron's orders!

01:47.374 --> 01:48.707
Aw, come on!

01:48.709 --> 01:50.442
That double-crossing baron!

01:50.444 --> 01:52.311
Nobody takes other people's
stuff away from us

01:52.313 --> 01:53.412
and gets away with it!
Nobody!

01:53.414 --> 01:55.414
Forget it.
We'll get him later.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.416
We've got bigger problems
at the moment.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.485
(horses neighing)

02:00.488 --> 02:01.620
Ooh!

02:04.391 --> 02:05.624
(grunts)

02:08.462 --> 02:10.729
(whimpering)
Check to see
if the coast is clear.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.364
(snarling)

02:13.567 --> 02:15.300
Yeah, not really.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.668
(both whimpering)

02:17.605 --> 02:18.637
Hiyah!

02:18.639 --> 02:21.673
(boys giggling)

02:21.675 --> 02:23.742
Help support Corona's orphans!

02:23.744 --> 02:29.448
Because every donation
brings a smile to the face
of a child in need.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.350
-Right, Eugene?
-That's right, Blondie.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.651
This cause is
dear to my heart.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.420
Many orphans go hungry,
while others...

02:36.524 --> 02:39.424
resort to a life of crime.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.694
Mmm-hmm.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.731
Hmm.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.434
Eugene, is everything okay?

02:49.436 --> 02:51.336
Huh? Yeah.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.373
Yeah. Sure.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.316
Everyone was so generous.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.518
Look at all these
clothes and toys and...

03:06.520 --> 03:09.321
(gasps) A beard?

03:09.323 --> 03:11.390
-Oh!
-Thank you!

03:11.392 --> 03:13.492
Just what
I was lookin' for.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.660
Aah!

03:14.662 --> 03:16.628
Uh-oh.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.764
Okay, Blondie.
Let's get you back
to the castle.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.700
Oh. Who is that?

03:21.702 --> 03:24.336
You know, I don't know,
and something tells me,

03:24.338 --> 03:25.704
we shouldn't stop to ask.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.408
(whimpers)

03:30.644 --> 03:32.444
(running footsteps)

03:34.715 --> 03:36.648
-(grunts)
-(grunts) Dead end.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.483
Rapunzel, that vase, now!

03:43.557 --> 03:46.725
(laughs)
Gotcha, Rider.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.661
-Man, you should've
seen your-- Huh?
-(thuds)

03:49.663 --> 03:52.564
Bam! Ha-ha!
Follow that, buddy!

03:52.566 --> 03:53.599
Hm!

03:53.601 --> 03:55.500
You know I meant
hide in the vase, right?

03:55.502 --> 03:57.436
(man groaning)

03:57.438 --> 04:00.839
Princess Rapunzel,
meet Lance Strongbow.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.741
How you doin'.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.843
So there I was, Princess--

04:04.845 --> 04:08.513
angry warlord to my left,
ferocious dire wolves
to my right,

04:08.515 --> 04:09.781
gold coins in my hand,

04:09.783 --> 04:12.517
and where's
my faithful partner,
Flynn Rider?

04:12.519 --> 04:15.354
Turns out this warlord
had these twin daughters
who were--

04:15.356 --> 04:18.423
Who were on vacation
far, far away.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.791
Oh, come on, Eugene.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.562
I may have grown up
in a tower, but give me
a little credit.

04:23.564 --> 04:27.532
Pray tell, how did two
fine, upstanding citizens,

04:27.534 --> 04:29.768
such as yourselves,
manage to find
each other?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.536
Oh, we go
way back,

04:31.538 --> 04:32.704
all the way
to the orphanage.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.873
Yeah.
We looked out
for each other,

04:34.875 --> 04:37.442
when no one else would.
(chuckles)

04:37.444 --> 04:39.544
In fact, you can say
we're the closest thing

04:39.546 --> 04:41.446
either of us ever had
to a family.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.781
-Aw, you guys.
-(chitters)

04:42.783 --> 04:47.719
So, Lance Strongbow,
if you guys are so tight,

04:47.721 --> 04:49.488
where have you been
all these years?

04:49.490 --> 04:50.756
Where have I been?

04:50.758 --> 04:53.759
More like, where
haven't I been?
(chuckles)

04:53.761 --> 04:55.394
You were in prison,
weren't you?

04:55.396 --> 04:57.729
Mostly, yes.
But you know,
right now,

04:57.731 --> 04:59.464
I'm not thinkin'
about where I've been.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.733
I'm thinking
about where I'm headed.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.670
-Ha-ha, yes!
That's the attitude!
-(squeals)

05:04.672 --> 05:07.639
And right now,
I'm headed to the bathroom.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.475
-Oh.
-Still, the attitude.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.710
(clears throat)

05:13.781 --> 05:16.615
Oh, come on!
Lance is my friend!

05:16.617 --> 05:19.751
You're right.
Stan, go with Pete.

05:21.422 --> 05:25.424
Hey, hey, Lance might not be
the straightest arrow
in the quiver,

05:25.426 --> 05:26.792
but he's our guest.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.428
He's a good guy,
and we don't need
to shadow him.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.696
Yeah. I agree.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.598
Lance is Eugene's
oldest friend.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.467
He wouldn't take advantage
of that.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.536
Well, I don't trust the guy.
I don't know what he's up to,

05:37.538 --> 05:39.671
but whatever it is,
I don't like it.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.641
Look, Cassandra, I know
you'd love nothing more

05:42.643 --> 05:44.710
than to see
one of my old friends
embarrass me,

05:44.712 --> 05:49.514
and I hate to disappoint you,
but my friend Lance is not
"up to" anything.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.516
Okay, Lance,
what are you up to?

05:51.518 --> 05:53.518
Up to? Me?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.721
You think I would
come all the way down--
Uh, see-- It w--

05:55.723 --> 05:57.789
Okay, I need help
with a job.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.693
Eugene:
<i>You want my help with a job?</i>

06:01.695 --> 06:05.530
Well, not a "job,"
a job.

06:05.532 --> 06:09.735
It's simple, victimless,
like taking candy
from a baby.

06:09.737 --> 06:13.505
And as previously established,
I just spent a little time
in the clink.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.707
<i>While there, I shared a cell</i>
<i> with this guy.</i>

06:15.709 --> 06:17.876
<i> His name was Calvin.</i>
<i> Or was it Clarence?</i>

06:17.878 --> 06:19.745
<i> Somethin' like that.</i>
<i> But I called him "Oldie,"</i>

06:19.747 --> 06:21.813
<i> -see, on account of--</i>
<i>- </i> Eugene: <i> He's old. I got it.</i>

06:21.815 --> 06:25.751
<i> Lance: Yeah! So old Oldie</i>
<i> tells me about this job</i>
<i> he pulled way back when.</i>

06:25.753 --> 06:28.754
<i> He hid the loot</i>
<i> in this cave system</i>
<i> beneath Corona</i>

06:28.756 --> 06:31.990
<i> and was gonna get it back</i>
<i> when the heat cooled off.</i>
<i> But it never did.</i>

06:31.992 --> 06:36.895
<i> So it just sat there,</i>
<i> forgotten, for years.</i>

06:36.897 --> 06:39.998
<i> Now, Oldie's gonna</i>
<i> be in jail for the rest</i>
<i> of his natural life.</i>

06:40.000 --> 06:44.669
<i>So he tells me,</i>
<i>"You should get it</i>
<i>for yourself."</i>

06:44.671 --> 06:48.607
(clapping)
Great story. Could've used
a bit more conflict,

06:48.609 --> 06:50.776
but the use of props
added a nice touch.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.011
I'm serious.
It's just sitting there.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.746
And I need your help
to go get it.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.715
I'm sorry,
but you can count me out.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.583
My days as a thief
are behind me.

06:58.585 --> 07:02.554
I don't need a thief.
I need a friend.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.557
-Come on, Flynn!
-Eugene.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.960
Eugene?
(laughing)

07:08.962 --> 07:10.695
Talk about your throwback.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.898
You got your break,
a huge break.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.935
All I'm asking is
for a little help
getting my own.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.604
Please? Come on, buddy.

07:20.707 --> 07:21.940
(sighs)

07:21.942 --> 07:25.577
Well, I guess it is
a victimless crime.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.946
They don't come
less victimful.

07:29.616 --> 07:33.652
Fine. I'll help you.
But you have to promise
not a word to anyone,

07:33.654 --> 07:36.888
especially Cassandra!
And, honestly, put those back.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.691
(clatters)

07:41.762 --> 07:44.930
Lance is gonna be
just down the hall
from Eugene, right?

07:44.932 --> 07:47.732
Unless... Do you think
they should be closer?

07:47.734 --> 07:51.837
(gasps)
Oh, you know what would
be perfect? Bunk beds!

07:51.839 --> 07:54.840
Yeah, and why don't you
make them some milk
and cookies?

07:54.842 --> 07:58.643
Um, all right, yeah.
I get it.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.779
You're making fun of me
for being excited

08:00.781 --> 08:02.681
Eugene's friend is here.

08:02.683 --> 08:06.618
But a midnight snack
is actually a perfect idea,
so thank you.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.587
And you're okay
with all of this?

08:08.589 --> 08:09.688
All of what?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.756
Oh, I don't know.
(laughs)

08:11.758 --> 08:14.025
You don't think
that maybe a lifetime criminal
who just got out of prison

08:14.027 --> 08:17.596
and happens to show up
on our front door could possibly
have ulterior motives

08:17.598 --> 08:19.798
that involves his long-lost
pal and partner in crime?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.834
Um... no,
I don't think so.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.710
-Hi, Eugene.
-Oh, hey! Blondie!

08:31.712 --> 08:33.011
Hey, hello. What's up?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.813
Uh, nothing.

08:34.815 --> 08:38.016
I just thought I'd see
what you were up to.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.652
Nothing!
I am up to nothing.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.622
Oh, okay.
Well, what's Lance up to?

08:43.624 --> 08:45.023
Lance? Oh, Lance!

08:45.025 --> 08:47.859
Nothing.
I mean, I'm sure
he's doing something.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.861
But he did seem tired.
Didn't he seem tired?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.796
In fact, he's probably
asleep already.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.966
So, in answer to your question
about what is Lance up to,

08:54.968 --> 08:57.836
I will answer,
Lance is up to sleeping.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.005
Why do you ask?

09:00.007 --> 09:02.040
Okay, uh... ugh.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.808
You're gonna think
this is funny.

09:03.810 --> 09:08.046
I think it's funny,
but Cass is concerned
that Lance and you

09:08.048 --> 09:11.082
are up to no good.
Crazy, right?

09:11.084 --> 09:16.087
What? You what--?
(laughing) That--
That's crazy talk.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.889
I know. (sighs)

09:17.891 --> 09:22.727
It's just, obviously,
I trust you, Eugene, but...

09:23.730 --> 09:27.098
I would really hate it
if she was right about Lance.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.000
I know.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.106
Psst!

09:35.108 --> 09:37.709
(whispers)
I said, psst!

09:37.711 --> 09:38.877
I heard your psst!

09:38.879 --> 09:40.745
Now, let's get on
with this.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.181
(sighs)

09:49.756 --> 09:50.789
(shrieks)

09:50.791 --> 09:52.791
Are you still afraid
of spiders?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.192
Yes, I have
acute arachnophobia.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.928
-Yeah, real cute.
-The treasure's this way.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.731
(rats squeaking)

09:59.733 --> 10:00.966
Well, looks like
the end of the line.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.902
Nah. You're just
getting rusty.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.204
Hey, I thought I told you
to put that back!

10:06.206 --> 10:08.740
Ha! Ha! Huh!

10:08.742 --> 10:10.809
(chuckles) Viola!

10:12.980 --> 10:14.813
Eugene:
What the--?

10:14.815 --> 10:18.049
This isn't a cave.
It's a basement.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.720
We broke into somebody's house!
Lance! You lied to me!

10:21.722 --> 10:26.791
Now, wait a minute!
Lying is a strong word.
Accurate, but strong.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.160
Besides, the only reason
I lied to you

10:29.162 --> 10:32.797
is because you wouldn't
have agreed to do this
otherwise.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.934
So, really,
we're both to blame.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.802
So, was any
of your story true?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.971
Well, there was
an old inmate
named Jesse,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.173
-and I did call him--
-Yeah, Oldie, I remember.

10:42.175 --> 10:45.076
No! Mr. Kilpatrick.

10:45.078 --> 10:48.013
Oldie?
That's just insensitive, Flynn.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.815
-What? You--
-Look. We can spend all day
trying to figure out

10:50.817 --> 10:51.916
who's in the wrong here,

10:51.918 --> 10:53.752
but I don't see
what the big deal is.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.153
Lying is
what we grew up on.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.989
-It's what we do.
-Did, Lance.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.191
I don't do that anymore.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.794
Well, good for you.
Want a medal?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.996
No, really, want one?
There are like 25
of these things.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.265
Let's just get
out of here, Arnwaldo.

11:07.267 --> 11:11.002
Hey! Don't call me Arnwaldo.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.806
Besides, don't you
at least wanna know
whose basement this is?

11:14.808 --> 11:16.007
No. No, I don't.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.043
It's the Baron's.

11:18.045 --> 11:21.112
The-- The Baron?

11:21.114 --> 11:23.048
The Baron Baron?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.182
You said we'd get him later.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.952
-That was
eight years ago.
-Exactly.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.121
We've waited
eight long years
for revenge,

11:30.123 --> 11:33.291
and I'm not leavin'
until I've settled the score.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.060
And now the score is settled.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.995
Let's get out of here.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.229
Wait a minute.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.132
We've gotta find
another way out.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.140
-(door creaking)
-Shh! Quietly!

11:49.142 --> 11:52.010
-Shh!
-Could you possibly
"shh" any louder?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.211
-(door slams)
-Eugene:
Quiet!

11:53.213 --> 11:55.046
(boots squeaking)

11:55.048 --> 11:59.050
Shh! Those have got to be
the squeakiest boots
I've ever heard!

11:59.052 --> 12:01.319
How do you know
it's not your shoes?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.955
Eugene:
No, I don't think
this is any quieter.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.060
Eugene (grunting):
See? No squeaks.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.962
-Oh!
-(clatters)

12:12.165 --> 12:15.233
Someone's there!
Get him!

12:15.235 --> 12:18.002
-Ooh!
-Eugene:
Oh! That hurt.

12:18.004 --> 12:21.072
-Lance: Sorry about that.
-Let's keep moving.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.278
Hey. Lance!

12:27.280 --> 12:29.180
Lance!

12:29.182 --> 12:31.282
Eugene!

12:31.284 --> 12:32.917
Where are you?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.255
Lance? Lance!

12:37.257 --> 12:40.892
-Eugene.
-No, my name is Percival.
Guards! Guards!

12:40.894 --> 12:42.293
-(Percival groans)
-Sorry!

12:42.295 --> 12:43.928
-(smacks)
-(grunts)

12:43.930 --> 12:46.264
(grunting)

12:48.034 --> 12:50.168
(panting)

12:53.373 --> 12:55.373
Lance?
I brought you a snack.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.009
I thought
you might be hungry.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.212
Lance?

13:01.214 --> 13:03.081
Hm.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.217
Oh, you know what?
He's probably just catching up
with Eugene in his room.

13:06.219 --> 13:09.954
Ugh! See? I knew the bunk beds
would've been a good idea.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.925
Eugene? Hello?

13:13.927 --> 13:17.228
Okay, so, maybe
they're catching up
somewhere else.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.063
(chitters)

13:22.903 --> 13:25.303
Hmm, what do
we have here?

13:25.305 --> 13:29.007
A plate of cheese
and crackers.
I wonder why?

13:29.009 --> 13:32.277
Uh, it's because
I am very hungry

13:32.279 --> 13:35.113
and very thirsty,
thank you very much.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.215
Mmm, so good.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.086
Okay, fine.
Yes, they're not home.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.322
But what is to say
that they're not out
having fun?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.125
Oh, I never said anything
about them not having fun.

13:47.127 --> 13:51.162
I'm just suggesting
they're most likely
stealing stuff while doing it.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.365
Okay, I have had
just about enough, Cassandra.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.968
You know what?
Let's go find Eugene,

13:56.970 --> 13:59.003
so I can show you
that you were wrong.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.338
Hmm?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.373
Okay, but when
I'm proven right,

14:02.375 --> 14:04.342
you're gonna have
egg on your face.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.444
Hoho! I promise you this,

14:06.446 --> 14:09.347
I will not have anything
on my face tonight.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.119
-Princess, you have
a milk mustache.
-I know what I have, Pete!

14:15.121 --> 14:16.287
Thank you.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.325
Haha! Wow!

14:20.327 --> 14:23.361
There's more gold coins
in here than I can count!

14:23.363 --> 14:25.063
So there must
be more than seven.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.197
What's wrong with you?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.466
You duped me!
You took advantage
of my loyalty!

14:28.468 --> 14:31.169
I wouldn't say
I took advantage,
I borrowed it.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.370
Here, you can have it back.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.206
Okay, you know what?
We are done, friend.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.475
I don't want anything
to do with you anymore.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.311
Wow. Money
has really changed you.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.379
Eugene.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.414
Yeah, Arnwaldo.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.149
I have changed.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.485
I am a different person,
a better person.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.420
But money had nothin'
to do with it.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.123
Rapunzel:
Eugene! Lance?

14:53.193 --> 14:54.292
(whimpers)

14:57.163 --> 14:58.162
(grunts)

14:58.164 --> 14:59.397
-(clatters)
-(chuckles nervously)

14:59.399 --> 15:01.165
What are you guys doing?

15:01.167 --> 15:05.103
Uh...
What are we doing?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.338
(stammering)
What were we do--
What are-- What--

15:07.340 --> 15:09.240
What is anyone doing, really?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.376
I mean, that's
the question here,
isn't it?

15:11.378 --> 15:14.412
Hey, ladies.
Looks like one of you ladies

15:14.414 --> 15:17.081
dropped your lady's ring.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.018
Your valuable...
lady's ring.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.520
Eugene, where did that ring
come from?

15:22.522 --> 15:26.124
-It came from--
-Our orphanage.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.359
Eugene and I were bequeathed it
from our favorite nanny.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.529
A sweet little old woman,
whom we affectionately
called "Oldie."

15:31.531 --> 15:34.299
Oldie was the closest thing
we ever had to a mom.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.267
So that ring
is very special to us.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.469
-Aw.
-When we left
the orphanage,

15:38.471 --> 15:42.206
we hid it...
inside a big oak tree
in these woods,

15:42.208 --> 15:45.476
promising each other
that the first one of us
to find true love,

15:45.478 --> 15:49.447
would be able to give
that special someone the ring.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.483
Princess, I believe
that would be you.

15:52.485 --> 15:57.522
(gasps) Eugene.
This is beautiful.

15:59.092 --> 16:02.293
Man... Mm! I'm good.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.502
Oh my gosh, Eugene,
Oldie must've been
from Corona.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.405
See? It has our crest.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.208
Oh, that's-- that's
quite a coincidence.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.551
Oh, no.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.155
Okay, that ring we stole
belonged to the queen.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.491
The same queen who took me
into her home and family,

16:33.493 --> 16:36.494
and as soon as she sees Rapunzel
wearing it, she will put two
and two together,

16:36.496 --> 16:38.196
and be furious.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.497
Or heartbroken.
I'm not sure how she'll react,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.132
she's a tough read sometimes.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.334
But, however she reacts,
it won't be good!

16:43.336 --> 16:46.371
Now, on the other hand,
if I ask Rapunzel to give me
the ring back,

16:46.373 --> 16:51.142
she'll realize I lied to her
earlier, and I know for a fact
that she will be devastated.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.477
And no matter
how this shakes down,

16:52.479 --> 16:55.546
Cassandra is going
to have the satisfaction
of being right!

16:55.548 --> 16:59.384
That's quite a sticky wicket
you got yourself into.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.618
We're gonna have
to steal that ring back.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.520
Steal from a princess?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.122
Let me know
how that works out for you.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.457
I'm sorry, what are you saying?
You have to help me!

17:06.459 --> 17:11.129
And defy the princess's trust?
Why would I do that?

17:11.131 --> 17:14.399
Either help me,
or I'll turn us both in.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.301
Ooh!

17:17.303 --> 17:18.436
Shush!

17:32.218 --> 17:35.420
(Rapunzel snoring)

17:45.331 --> 17:47.432
(snoring)

18:02.582 --> 18:04.482
(squeaking)

18:06.352 --> 18:09.520
(gasping)

18:09.522 --> 18:11.255
Run!

18:11.257 --> 18:13.324
Hey! Pascal!

18:14.294 --> 18:15.359
Ha!

18:18.398 --> 18:19.597
(whimpers)

18:19.599 --> 18:22.266
-Eugene: There's our exit!
-Hyah!

18:22.268 --> 18:23.601
I got this one.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.239
She'll destroy you.
Actually, go ahead.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.675
-(thudding)
-(Lance groans)

18:32.278 --> 18:33.511
(groans)

18:35.448 --> 18:37.315
-(clangs)
-(body thuds)

18:38.384 --> 18:39.617
Eugene?

18:45.258 --> 18:48.459
I can't believe
you would do this!

18:48.461 --> 18:52.597
Rapunzel, I...
I'm sorry.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.499
Princess? If I may--

18:54.501 --> 18:56.334
You know what?
You've said enough, Lance.

18:56.336 --> 18:59.303
-Don't listen to him.
-It's all my fault.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.471
But what do I know?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.473
Look, I lied to Eugene.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.442
And to you, Princess.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.410
About everything.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.412
He was only tryin'
to help a friend...

19:08.414 --> 19:11.482
or someone who used
to be his friend.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.650
I guess.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.421
I'm-- I'm truly sorry.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.757
I guess the right thing
for me to do now
is to come clean

19:19.759 --> 19:24.262
-to your mom.
-Eugene, what you did
was deceitful,

19:24.264 --> 19:26.697
and by every right, yes,
you should come clean
to my mom,

19:26.699 --> 19:30.368
but I can't let you do that.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.303
Wait. What. Why?

19:32.305 --> 19:33.671
Because I love you, Eugene,

19:33.673 --> 19:37.542
and I will forgive you,
but I can't be sure
they will.

19:37.544 --> 19:42.313
So... (sighs) Okay,
here's what we're gonna do.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.715
We are going to sneak the ring
back into my mom's room--

19:44.717 --> 19:49.320
Rapunzel, hey.
Stop. Look, I--
I love you, too,

19:49.322 --> 19:51.689
so much, and thank you,
but I can't.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.625
Cheating, lying and deception,
that may have been
how Flynn Rider

19:54.627 --> 19:57.728
would handle this,
but I'm Eugene Fitzherbert now,

19:57.730 --> 19:59.664
and I have to do this
the right way.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.400
That means
accepting the consequences,

20:02.402 --> 20:03.701
no matter what they are.

20:03.703 --> 20:07.538
(sniffs)
It's how Oldie
would've wanted it.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.644
Arianna:
I appreciate your apology
and your honesty.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.680
Though the robbery
was many years ago, Eugene,

20:15.682 --> 20:19.650
it was, frankly, traumatic,
and I'm not sure I can
forgive you.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.386
I understand. I do.

20:22.388 --> 20:26.490
I guess now I just hope
that the king won't banish me
from Corona

20:26.492 --> 20:27.725
when he finds out about this.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.762
Well, yes. We shall see
what the king decides.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.468
Eugene:
So, I got you something.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.838
It's not very nice,
and there's no story
behind it--

20:40.840 --> 20:44.375
Well, if you don't count
the part about how the guy
who sold it to me

20:44.377 --> 20:45.776
had something
dangling from his nose,

20:45.778 --> 20:49.580
but I guess that's
not so much a story
as an observation.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.816
Anyway, the point is,
I didn't steal it.

20:54.687 --> 20:58.389
I am really sorry
I hurt you, Rapunzel.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.424
That's the last thing
I'd ever want to do.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.759
I know, Eugene.

21:08.434 --> 21:12.370
What? I thought that ring
was long gone!

21:12.372 --> 21:13.804
Yes. Can you believe it?

21:13.806 --> 21:15.840
Eugene found it this morning.

21:19.746 --> 21:24.482
And as for Lance,
who knows when I'll ever
see him again.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.601
(chitters)

21:26.602 --> 21:28.719
Do you think Lance meant it
when he said he was sorry?

21:28.721 --> 21:29.887
I don't know.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.789
Some people never change.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.893
Oh! By the way,
do you know a Mr. Schnitz?

21:35.895 --> 21:39.463
Arnwaldo Schnitz,
yeah, that's Lance, uh--

21:39.465 --> 21:40.798
Yes. Why?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.266
Heh.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.803
Rapunzel:
<i>Well, Mr. Schnitz just</i>
<i>made a generous donation</i>

21:45.805 --> 21:47.738
<i>to the orphanage charity.</i>

21:47.740 --> 21:51.442
Eugene:
<i> Really? How much?</i>

21:51.444 --> 21:54.512
Rapunzel:
<i> Oh, about a stolen</i>
<i> treasure's worth.</i>

21:57.483 --> 21:58.716
Yep.

22:00.753 --> 22:04.588
Okay. Where did I put
that beard?

22:07.694 --> 22:10.494
(theme music playing)

22:10.496 --> 22:13.597
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes</i>
<i> opening wider ¶</i>

22:13.599 --> 22:15.833
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:15.835 --> 22:18.436
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.438 --> 22:19.937
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:19.939 --> 22:22.840
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now,</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:22.842 --> 22:25.676
<i>¶ Who I am, I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.678 --> 22:28.779
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.781 --> 22:32.717
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more of me</i>
<i> to give ¶</i>

22:32.719 --> 22:35.853
<i> ¶ Oh yeah,</i>
<i>there's more of me to give ¶</i>
