00:26.376 --> 00:28.012
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

00:28.079 --> 00:29.479
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

00:29.546 --> 00:31.581
<i>You'll float, too!</i>

00:39.357 --> 00:41.125
I saw all of us.

00:42.093 --> 00:44.095
All of us were there.

00:45.229 --> 00:46.964
Back in the cistern.

00:48.366 --> 00:50.767
But we were older.

00:50.834 --> 00:52.602
We were our parents' ages.

00:52.669 --> 00:55.139
Am I still handsome
as an adult?

00:56.539 --> 00:58.175
You grow into your looks.

00:58.242 --> 01:00.077
What the fuck does that mean?

01:02.079 --> 01:03.747
What about me?

01:05.216 --> 01:06.884
Like now,

01:06.951 --> 01:08.052
but taller.

01:16.793 --> 01:17.794
Swear it.

01:18.528 --> 01:22.432
Swear if It isn't dead,

01:23.200 --> 01:25.502
if It ever comes back,

01:25.568 --> 01:26.770
we'll come back, too.

01:31.441 --> 01:32.776
<i>Memory,</i>

01:34.644 --> 01:36.546
<i>it's a funny thing.</i>

01:39.116 --> 01:40.717
<i>People want to
believe they are</i>

01:40.784 --> 01:42.485
<i>what they choose
to remember.</i>

01:44.288 --> 01:45.488
<i>The good stuff.</i>

01:47.024 --> 01:48.025
<i>The moments.</i>

01:50.161 --> 01:51.761
<i>The places.</i>

01:54.631 --> 01:56.566
<i>The people
we all hold on to.</i>

01:59.437 --> 02:00.637
<i>But sometimes...</i>

02:03.307 --> 02:04.607
<i>sometimes</i>

02:06.676 --> 02:09.180
<i>we are what we wish
we could forget.</i>

02:32.236 --> 02:34.138
Okay, kids.

02:34.205 --> 02:36.140
Get ready.

02:36.207 --> 02:37.507
Go!

02:38.409 --> 02:39.676
Who's it gonna be?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.178
First one to pop
their balloon's a winner!

02:41.245 --> 02:43.080
It could be anyone!
We got a real

02:43.147 --> 02:45.449
- barn burner here, folks.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

02:45.515 --> 02:46.851
It's getting close.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.519
Who's gonna catch the
leader, huh?

02:49.586 --> 02:52.123
Who's gonna be
the big winner tonight?

02:52.189 --> 02:53.391
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!

02:54.691 --> 02:56.160
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

02:56.227 --> 02:57.594
- Thank you.
- Wow.

02:57.660 --> 02:59.230
You really showed 'em, huh?

02:59.296 --> 03:00.663
I did. I...

03:01.399 --> 03:02.900
Yeah.

03:02.967 --> 03:06.904
Hey, girl, do you want this?

03:06.971 --> 03:08.305
Thanks
for letting me win.

03:09.539 --> 03:11.574
Yeah.

03:11.641 --> 03:12.742
What'd you get, Vicky?

03:12.809 --> 03:13.978
Aww.
Such a gentleman.

03:14.045 --> 03:16.147
Look at that!

03:16.213 --> 03:19.350
Well, here is
your consolation prize.

03:19.417 --> 03:20.784
Look at that.

03:20.851 --> 03:23.087
Never been a fan
of the beaver,

03:23.154 --> 03:25.588
but look at this hat.
I mean...

03:26.223 --> 03:27.291
Thank you.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.097
So, we need
to talk logistics.

03:33.164 --> 03:35.099
Ooh. How romantic.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.766
Romantic?

03:37.868 --> 03:39.702
What's so
fucking romantic, huh?

03:41.472 --> 03:44.141
Hey.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.043
Your mommas ever teach you
boys to respond to someone

03:46.110 --> 03:47.744
when they ask you
a fucking question?

03:48.379 --> 03:49.880
Come on, Adrian.

03:51.449 --> 03:53.050
You got a problem, faggot?

03:54.784 --> 03:58.289
I don't,
but Meg Ryan called.

03:58.355 --> 04:00.590
She wants her wig back.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.724
All right. All right.

04:01.791 --> 04:03.693
Come on.
Come on, Adrian.

04:08.265 --> 04:09.867
Stuff like that is

04:09.934 --> 04:11.402
why I have to leave
this shithole town.

04:11.469 --> 04:12.536
Small minds.

04:12.602 --> 04:13.670
They have small dicks.

04:13.736 --> 04:15.139
I'm being serious.

04:15.206 --> 04:16.373
We belong elsewhere.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.175
Hey, look,
if you end up hating New York,

04:18.242 --> 04:20.578
we can always
move back here.

04:20.643 --> 04:22.146
I just want
to be with you.

04:22.213 --> 04:24.215
I don't care.
New York, Derry, whatever. It's...

04:24.281 --> 04:25.748
You have to say that.

04:25.815 --> 04:26.951
I don't have
to say anything.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.053
Take off that fucking hat.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.988
- Oh, God.
- Come on, let's go.

04:31.055 --> 04:32.789
Wouldn't want to
give people the impression

04:32.857 --> 04:34.525
we allow a bunch of fucking
fairies like you in this town.

04:34.592 --> 04:36.060
Yeah, he was
born here, asshole.

04:36.127 --> 04:38.963
- All right, let's go.
- No. You know what?

04:39.029 --> 04:40.297
I'll take off the hat
for you.

04:40.364 --> 04:41.932
But why leave it there?

04:41.999 --> 04:43.400
Anything else
you would like me

04:43.467 --> 04:45.136
to take off
for you tonight?

04:45.202 --> 04:48.305
Any special requests, ladies?

04:50.407 --> 04:51.674
Fucker!

04:51.741 --> 04:54.478
Let him go!

05:00.918 --> 05:02.685
- What's that?
- Stop.

05:02.752 --> 05:04.622
I don't think
you'll be needing that.

05:04.687 --> 05:06.656
- Leave him alone!
- Hit him.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.393
He's got asthma, fucker!

05:14.899 --> 05:17.067
Come on!

05:17.134 --> 05:18.936
Fuck him up!

05:19.003 --> 05:21.071
Come on,
kick him!

05:21.138 --> 05:22.339
Come on,
kick the shit out of him.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.275
Adrian!

05:28.711 --> 05:30.747
I still hate
your fucking hair.

05:33.184 --> 05:35.319
Adrian!

05:35.386 --> 05:37.321
Get the fuck off him!

05:38.422 --> 05:40.291
Look what you did
to his fucking face!

05:41.225 --> 05:43.793
Hey! Hey!
Help me get him up.

05:43.861 --> 05:45.296
Adrian.

05:45.362 --> 05:48.098
Help me get this fucking
punk up right now.

05:54.471 --> 05:56.240
Give me the hat, Chris.

05:56.307 --> 05:57.208
It's fucking mine!

05:57.274 --> 05:59.043
I said give me
the fucking hat!

06:00.945 --> 06:02.513
Adrian!

06:03.881 --> 06:05.049
You like that?

06:05.115 --> 06:07.151
Welcome to Derry,
motherfucker.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.554
No! Adrian!

06:10.621 --> 06:11.989
No!

06:14.291 --> 06:16.093
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.895
- Let's go!
- No!

06:23.901 --> 06:25.369
Adrian!

06:26.437 --> 06:27.471
Help!

06:28.838 --> 06:30.507
Help me!

06:31.642 --> 06:32.943
Somebody!

06:36.714 --> 06:38.515
Somebody fucking help me!

06:52.563 --> 06:53.964
Oh...

06:57.167 --> 06:58.869
Adrian.

07:07.311 --> 07:09.880
No!

07:14.218 --> 07:15.586
Adrian!

07:23.494 --> 07:26.829
<i>We all
float down here!</i>

07:30.034 --> 07:32.169
<i>Thing is,</i>

07:32.236 --> 07:35.139
<i>sometimes what we wish
was forgotten,</i>

07:36.407 --> 07:39.143
<i>what we tried to
leave in the past,</i>

07:40.611 --> 07:42.946
<i>won't stay there.</i>

07:44.548 --> 07:46.517
<i>Units, please respond.</i>

07:46.583 --> 07:48.452
<i>I'm getting reports of a
body found dismembered.</i>

07:48.519 --> 07:50.921
<i>Come back.
Was that "dismembered"?</i>

07:50.988 --> 07:52.289
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

07:52.356 --> 07:53.524
<i>Scene is near
the south entrance</i>

07:53.590 --> 07:54.925
<i>of the festival grounds.</i>

07:54.992 --> 07:56.460
<i>Copy that. En route.</i>

07:56.527 --> 07:57.761
<i>Any directive for TC?</i>

07:57.827 --> 07:59.563
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

07:59.630 --> 08:01.498
<i>Chief said to tape off
the Derry Street Bridge.</i>

08:01.565 --> 08:04.301
<i>Sometimes,
it comes back for you.</i>

09:20.010 --> 09:22.012
Ah.

09:23.380 --> 09:25.349
Mr. Denbrough?
They need you on set.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.190
We're just going to
go this way.

09:33.257 --> 09:35.092
- I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
- No, don't!

09:35.159 --> 09:36.693
Hey!
Clear the door!

09:36.760 --> 09:38.028
Oh, come on.
You've never seen <i>Indiana Jones?</i>

09:38.095 --> 09:39.963
Watch your back.

09:40.030 --> 09:41.532
Hey, hey.
You a crewmember?

09:41.598 --> 09:43.200
I'm the writer.

09:52.776 --> 09:54.311
Your husband's here.

09:54.378 --> 09:56.447
Hey!
Do you have the pages?

09:56.513 --> 09:59.016
Everyone,
keep clear of the crane.

09:59.082 --> 10:02.786
My friend,
a film needs an ending.

10:02.854 --> 10:04.555
- You do know that, right?
- Oh, yeah.

10:04.621 --> 10:06.623
You said that
you needed another day

10:06.690 --> 10:08.058
to finish the pages,

10:08.125 --> 10:09.092
and we're shooting this thing.
It's tonight.

10:09.159 --> 10:10.194
That's, like, 17 hours...

10:10.260 --> 10:11.495
Everybody, calm down, okay?

10:11.562 --> 10:12.629
I'm calm.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.465
I want you to be
happy with the movie.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.266
You understand?
I'm on your side.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.135
That's great.
'Cause in my book, the ending...

10:18.202 --> 10:19.703
Is terrible.

10:19.770 --> 10:22.539
All due respect,
people loved your book. Loved.

10:22.606 --> 10:24.074
They hated the ending.

10:24.141 --> 10:25.843
You said
you liked the ending.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.344
That was a lie.

10:27.411 --> 10:29.546
- We gotta do better, okay?
- Yeah.

10:29.613 --> 10:32.549
Audra, you have my notes.
Would you...

10:32.616 --> 10:35.519
Okay, thank you very much.
Take me back to one, please.

10:35.586 --> 10:36.820
Bye.

10:36.888 --> 10:38.890
You have his notes?

10:38.957 --> 10:40.892
He's not wrong.

10:40.959 --> 10:42.626
You hate my endings, too?

10:42.693 --> 10:44.094
Not all your endings.

10:44.161 --> 10:45.229
But this...

10:45.295 --> 10:47.297
- Okay.
- Just...

10:47.364 --> 10:49.633
What? Do you want me
to keep lying to you

10:49.700 --> 10:51.802
- just because I'm your wife?
- You're my wife?

10:51.870 --> 10:53.370
No. No.
But you know what?

10:53.437 --> 10:55.305
You've been blowing smoke
up my ass for eight years?

10:55.372 --> 10:56.707
I guess I thought
you were someone else.

10:56.773 --> 10:59.510
I have not been
blowing smoke up your ass.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.712
Everybody wants
a happy ending.

11:01.778 --> 11:03.113
Everybody wants closure.

11:03.180 --> 11:04.781
But that's not
the way life works out.

11:04.848 --> 11:07.184
I think what Peter wants
and what the studio wants...

11:07.251 --> 11:09.686
The studio?
When'd you become a company man?

11:09.753 --> 11:11.221
Jesus, you're an artist.

11:11.288 --> 11:12.689
Come on.
What's wrong with just doing it

11:12.756 --> 11:14.491
the way it's written?
The way I wanted.

11:14.558 --> 11:15.692
What's wrong with being
the woman I want you to be?

11:16.593 --> 11:17.996
Fuck you, Bill.

11:18.061 --> 11:21.131
On the page.
The part, I mean. Not you.

11:28.505 --> 11:29.473
Hello?

11:29.540 --> 11:32.376
<i>Bill Denbrough?
It's Mike.</i>

11:32.442 --> 11:33.443
Mike who?

11:34.511 --> 11:36.346
Mike Hanlon.

11:36.413 --> 11:38.315
<i>From Derry.</i>

11:45.322 --> 11:47.224
You need to come home.

11:53.163 --> 11:54.698
<i>Eddie,
I keep telling you</i>

11:54.765 --> 11:56.233
<i>not to scare me
like this.</i>

11:56.300 --> 11:57.534
<i>And you never
listen to me.</i>

11:57.601 --> 11:59.037
All right. Myra, please.
Not now.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.338
You shouldn't be out there.

12:01.405 --> 12:02.606
Eddie, it's not safe
to drive

12:02.673 --> 12:04.074
when the roads
are slick like this.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.208
Sweetheart,
it stopped raining, like,

12:05.275 --> 12:06.710
three hours ago.
All right?

12:06.777 --> 12:08.612
Everything is gonna be fine.

12:08.679 --> 12:09.881
Hey, dickhead!
Flow of traffic mean anything to you?

12:09.948 --> 12:11.181
What if you hydroplane?

12:11.248 --> 12:12.951
I'm not gonna hydroplane.

12:13.017 --> 12:14.718
It is my job
to assess risk.

12:14.785 --> 12:16.453
So, please trust me
when I tell you

12:16.520 --> 12:17.821
that, statistically speaking,

12:17.889 --> 12:19.523
I am much more likely to
get into an accident

12:19.590 --> 12:21.758
because I am talking
to you on the phone!

12:21.825 --> 12:23.193
All right?
I have to go.

12:23.260 --> 12:24.963
I will talk to you soon.
Goodbye.

12:27.197 --> 12:28.565
Edward Kaspbrak speaking.

12:28.632 --> 12:30.001
<i>You didn't say,
"Okay, bye, I love you,"</i>

12:30.068 --> 12:31.134
<i>like you usually do.</i>

12:31.201 --> 12:32.402
Listen to me. I can't!

12:32.469 --> 12:33.470
I'm going to be
late to this...

12:34.939 --> 12:35.940
meeting.

12:36.007 --> 12:37.240
<i>Say "I love you," Eddie.</i>

12:37.307 --> 12:39.077
Okay, I love you, Mommy.

12:39.142 --> 12:40.811
What?

12:40.878 --> 12:42.880
Myra. Bye.

12:44.015 --> 12:45.649
Hello? Who's this?

12:45.716 --> 12:47.018
<i>It's me. Mike.</i>

12:47.085 --> 12:48.285
Mike who?

12:51.121 --> 12:52.522
<i>Eddie! You okay?</i>

12:52.589 --> 12:54.391
Yeah,
I'm pretty good.

13:00.031 --> 13:01.798
Dude! Dude,
what the fuck?

13:01.866 --> 13:03.567
You were fine, like,
five seconds ago.

13:03.634 --> 13:05.870
Who was it? Who called? Huh?

13:05.937 --> 13:08.271
Rich? Rich?
Talk to me.

13:08.338 --> 13:10.041
You're on in two minutes.
You good?

13:10.108 --> 13:11.808
'Cause you look not good.

13:14.012 --> 13:15.178
- I'm fine.
- You're fine? Okay.

13:15.245 --> 13:16.747
And we're walking.
We're walking.

13:16.813 --> 13:17.949
Sixty seconds.

13:18.016 --> 13:19.249
Even faster. All right.

13:19.316 --> 13:20.517
Can we get him
a bottle of water, maybe?

13:20.584 --> 13:22.552
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon. Sure, sure.

13:22.619 --> 13:24.088
And a mint.

13:24.154 --> 13:25.689
It is showtime.

13:25.756 --> 13:27.357
- I don't think I can do this.
- It's what you do.

13:27.424 --> 13:29.093
- You kill. You're a killer.
- That was fast.

13:29.159 --> 13:30.862
Okay. We are
good to go, and...

13:30.928 --> 13:32.529
Hey! Where we going?
Where we going?

13:32.596 --> 13:33.865
No. This way. Attaboy.

13:33.931 --> 13:35.432
Okay.

13:35.499 --> 13:38.002
All right.
How do I look?

13:38.069 --> 13:39.836
Your hands are shaking, Rich.

13:39.904 --> 13:41.204
Shit.

13:41.271 --> 13:42.706
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

13:42.773 --> 13:45.375
<i>please welcome Richie Tozier!</i>

13:52.150 --> 13:53.918
All right.
How are we doing tonight?

13:56.586 --> 13:58.990
So, my girlfriend
caught me masturbating

13:59.057 --> 14:00.925
to her friend's Facebook page.

14:03.493 --> 14:05.362
And so now
I'm in Masturbators Anonymous.

14:06.563 --> 14:08.265
And I stand up
at the first meeting

14:08.331 --> 14:11.102
and I say, "My name
is Richie Trashmouth."

14:11.169 --> 14:13.071
- <i>Trashmouth.</i>
- <i>Shut up, Richie.</i>

14:13.137 --> 14:15.139
- <i>Fucking perv.</i>
- <i>Shut up, Richie.</i>

14:15.205 --> 14:16.306
<i>Pussy!</i>

14:16.373 --> 14:18.275
Trashmouth. Uh...

14:20.878 --> 14:22.312
Forgot the joke.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.448
You suck!

14:28.385 --> 14:29.887
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

14:29.954 --> 14:31.588
for letting us
present to you today.

14:31.655 --> 14:35.193
Now, this will include
over a million square feet

14:35.258 --> 14:38.328
of commercial
and residential space.

14:38.395 --> 14:39.964
State-of-the-art
office towers.

14:40.031 --> 14:42.399
What I'm really looking for
is to understand

14:42.466 --> 14:45.368
how we create even more
retail opportunities.

14:45.435 --> 14:48.705
If we put in walls here
and all along here...

14:48.772 --> 14:50.373
<i>Lose them.</i>

14:51.943 --> 14:54.778
<i>With all due respect,
Mr. Hanscom...</i>

14:54.845 --> 14:58.149
Ben, please.
And with all due respect to you,

14:58.216 --> 14:59.516
I'm getting claustrophobic

14:59.583 --> 15:02.053
just looking at this model.
Aren't you?

15:02.120 --> 15:05.622
Look. Throw up more walls,
it's gonna feel like a prison.

15:05.689 --> 15:07.191
You know what people
want to do in prison?

15:07.257 --> 15:09.060
Get out. Right?

15:09.127 --> 15:12.029
This should be a place
that brings people together.

15:12.796 --> 15:13.965
A meeting ground.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.273
A clubhouse.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.642
<i>And if,</i>

15:25.709 --> 15:27.577
while people are there...

15:31.548 --> 15:33.017
<i>Excuse me
for one second.</i>

15:38.822 --> 15:40.858
- Hello?
- <i>Ben?</i>

15:40.925 --> 15:43.760
<i>It's Mike Hanlon.
From Derry.</i>

16:01.545 --> 16:03.413
Should I just book it?

16:03.480 --> 16:05.149
You're sure you can
get away from work?

16:05.216 --> 16:06.716
It's summer, why not?

16:07.919 --> 16:10.254
Okay, we are
Buenos Aires-bound.

16:24.434 --> 16:25.937
Stanley Uris speaking.

16:27.337 --> 16:29.006
It's Mike.

16:29.073 --> 16:30.174
I'm sorry?

16:30.241 --> 16:31.708
<i>Mike Hanlon.</i>

16:32.409 --> 16:33.844
<i>From Derry.</i>

16:36.047 --> 16:37.514
Mike.

16:37.581 --> 16:40.017
God, sorry. Yes, hi.

16:40.084 --> 16:42.385
I don't
know why I didn't...

16:45.189 --> 16:47.091
How long's it been?

16:47.158 --> 16:48.692
A long time.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.761
<i>27 years.</i>

16:58.269 --> 17:00.304
It's come back,
hasn't it?

17:00.370 --> 17:01.571
<i>That's why
you're calling me?</i>

17:01.638 --> 17:03.773
It's starting again, Stan.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.709
<i>Bad things are happening.</i>

17:05.775 --> 17:06.911
Did you call the others?

17:06.978 --> 17:09.247
I mean,
what if they don't come?

17:09.313 --> 17:12.216
We made a promise,
remember?

17:12.283 --> 17:13.817
<i>How soon
can you get here?</i>

17:14.384 --> 17:15.685
Um...

17:15.752 --> 17:17.021
Well, I...

17:17.088 --> 17:19.290
Yeah, I would need to
do a few things...

17:19.357 --> 17:20.992
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

17:21.859 --> 17:23.560
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

17:25.562 --> 17:26.763
<i>I'll text you
everything you need.</i>

17:27.865 --> 17:29.432
I'll see you soon,
Stan the Man.

18:04.801 --> 18:08.906
Do you swear?

18:16.981 --> 18:18.515
I swear, Bill.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.331
<i>You made
a promise, Beverly.</i>

19:07.398 --> 19:09.200
I'm so sorry, Mike.

19:09.266 --> 19:11.835
I don't even really remember.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.703
Haven't you ever wondered
why you can't seem

19:13.770 --> 19:15.839
to remember the things
most people should

19:15.906 --> 19:19.609
<i>about where they're from,
about who they are,</i>

19:19.676 --> 19:21.611
<i>why you have that scar
on your hand?</i>

19:24.514 --> 19:26.649
<i>No one else remembered,
either.</i>

19:26.716 --> 19:30.121
<i>Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie...</i>

19:30.187 --> 19:31.255
<i>Bill.</i>

19:31.322 --> 19:32.722
Bill.

19:33.523 --> 19:35.525
You have to come back.

19:37.161 --> 19:38.162
You all do.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.765
When?

19:57.448 --> 19:58.815
Whoa.

19:58.883 --> 20:00.418
Are you okay?
What's going on?

20:00.484 --> 20:04.621
It's the middle of the night.
You're packing?

20:04.687 --> 20:06.123
I didn't want to wake
you, honey.

20:06.190 --> 20:08.558
I know this week's
been really exhausting.

20:08.625 --> 20:12.729
I just got a phone call from
an old friend from Derry.

20:14.697 --> 20:17.134
I have to go back there.

20:17.201 --> 20:19.103
It's really hard
to explain why.

20:19.170 --> 20:20.171
It's okay.

20:21.939 --> 20:24.841
You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Relax.

20:25.443 --> 20:26.977
I trust you.

20:27.044 --> 20:28.245
Thank you.

20:31.248 --> 20:35.585
I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.

20:39.789 --> 20:41.258
I heard you.

20:42.426 --> 20:45.062
You said the name Mike.

20:45.129 --> 20:46.130
Yes, my friend.

20:46.197 --> 20:47.998
See, there was
a group of us back then,

20:48.065 --> 20:50.201
and we all made a promise to
each other when we were kids.

20:50.267 --> 20:53.170
You know trust is everything
in a relationship.

20:53.237 --> 20:56.574
You know
it's everything to me, right?

20:56.639 --> 20:58.608
- I know. This isn't...
- Right?

20:58.675 --> 21:00.610
What?
Like the last time?

21:00.677 --> 21:02.446
I never cheated on you.

21:02.513 --> 21:03.914
You're a bad fucking liar,

21:03.981 --> 21:05.149
Bev.

21:05.216 --> 21:07.717
You're not going anywhere,
okay?

21:07.784 --> 21:10.421
I want you to stay right here,

21:10.488 --> 21:11.856
and you're gonna show me

21:11.922 --> 21:14.258
what it is you're gonna
do with Mike. Okay?

21:14.325 --> 21:15.860
You're hurting me, honey.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.995
No one else is
gonna love you like me.

21:18.062 --> 21:19.296
You know that, right?

21:21.298 --> 21:22.366
I'm sorry.

21:28.838 --> 21:30.040
Don't make this
fucking harder!

21:30.107 --> 21:31.242
Don't.

21:57.201 --> 22:00.204
You're nothing without me!
You know that, right?

22:00.271 --> 22:01.906
Tell me I'm wrong!

23:16.513 --> 23:18.215
Jesus Christ.

23:18.282 --> 23:19.849
Boys.

23:19.917 --> 23:22.386
Little prick's got balls,
I'll give him that.

23:22.453 --> 23:23.520
Far enough, Bowers!

23:23.587 --> 23:24.821
I'm not done yet.

23:24.888 --> 23:26.257
I'm not done.
I'm not fucking done.

23:26.323 --> 23:27.725
- On your knees.
- I can't. No!

23:27.790 --> 23:29.826
I gotta kill them all!
Fuck, fuck!

23:29.893 --> 23:31.462
Fucking kill them all!
Stop it!

23:31.528 --> 23:34.665
- Cuff this sorry sack of shit!
- Fuck you!

23:34.732 --> 23:36.133
Fuck you!

23:36.200 --> 23:38.068
Henry Bowers,
I am placing you under arrest

23:38.135 --> 23:39.870
for the murder
of Oscar Bowers.

23:39.937 --> 23:42.106
Do you understand, dipshit?

23:43.140 --> 23:44.975
You have the right
to an attorney.

23:45.042 --> 23:47.144
You have the right
to remain silent.

24:32.489 --> 24:33.924
Bowers!

24:33.991 --> 24:36.860
Bowers, calm the fuck down!

24:45.402 --> 24:48.305
Someone needs a little extra
clozapine today, don't they?

24:49.773 --> 24:51.608
Stay in your fucking room.

25:52.469 --> 25:53.504
Hockstetter.

25:57.808 --> 25:59.143
My knife.

26:13.892 --> 26:15.959
- Whoa.
- Careful.

26:16.026 --> 26:17.561
This way.

26:17.628 --> 26:19.196
Thanks a lot.

26:22.867 --> 26:24.435
- Hey.
- Oh...

26:24.501 --> 26:25.836
- Mike, you look good.
- Bill.

26:25.904 --> 26:28.338
Yup. Whoa.
Hey. How you doing?

26:28.907 --> 26:30.140
Bill.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.342
I didn't know
if any of you would...

26:32.409 --> 26:33.477
I mean,
after all this time...

26:33.544 --> 26:34.812
- Yeah.
- But of course you came.

26:34.879 --> 26:36.947
You know,
an oath is an oath.

26:37.014 --> 26:38.982
Losers

26:39.950 --> 26:41.685
gotta stick together, right?

26:41.752 --> 26:42.887
The Losers.

26:42.953 --> 26:45.289
You remember that.
That's good.

26:46.390 --> 26:47.991
What else do you remember?

26:48.058 --> 26:49.359
I am allergic to soy,

26:49.426 --> 26:51.428
anything that has egg in
it, uh, gluten,

26:51.495 --> 26:55.432
and if I eat a cashew,
I could realistically die.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.402
Holy shit.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.519
Is there a password
or something?

27:18.088 --> 27:19.289
I'm sorry.

27:20.457 --> 27:21.758
The new kid.

27:22.826 --> 27:24.027
Ben?

27:24.761 --> 27:25.996
Yeah.

27:27.998 --> 27:29.066
Oh, my God.

27:29.132 --> 27:31.268
Oh, my God.

27:31.335 --> 27:33.537
It's been so long.

27:36.473 --> 27:38.475
<i>Stay cool,
Ben from soc class.</i>

27:38.542 --> 27:40.344
<i>You too, Beverly.</i>

27:40.410 --> 27:41.678
<i>Hang tough,
new kid on the block.</i>

27:43.847 --> 27:45.048
Wow.

27:45.749 --> 27:47.784
You two look amazing.

27:47.852 --> 27:50.020
What the fuck
happened to me?

27:51.255 --> 27:52.489
- What's going on, man?
- Hey, man.

27:52.556 --> 27:54.591
- It's Richie. Hi.
- Yeah. It's Ben.

27:56.059 --> 27:57.728
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:00.197 --> 28:01.331
This meeting
of the Losers' Club

28:01.398 --> 28:02.699
has officially begun.

28:02.766 --> 28:04.101
Look at these guys.

28:07.204 --> 28:08.438
Ben.

28:15.045 --> 28:16.513
So, wait, Eddie,
you got married?

28:16.580 --> 28:18.016
Yeah, why's that so fucking
funny, dickwad?

28:18.081 --> 28:19.449
What?
To, like, a woman?

28:19.516 --> 28:21.418
Fuck you, bro.

28:21.485 --> 28:22.887
Fuck you!

28:22.954 --> 28:24.254
All right. What about you, Trashmouth?
You married?

28:24.321 --> 28:26.089
There's no way
Richie's married.

28:26.156 --> 28:27.357
No, I got married.

28:27.424 --> 28:28.692
- Richie, I don't believe it.
- When?

28:28.759 --> 28:30.127
- Did you not hear this?
- No.

28:30.193 --> 28:31.395
You didn't know
I got married?

28:31.461 --> 28:32.596
- No.
- Yeah, no. Me and your mom

28:32.663 --> 28:34.631
are very, very happy
right now.

28:34.698 --> 28:36.233
Yeah, very happy.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.367
- He totally fell for it!
- Thanks.

28:38.903 --> 28:40.504
Fuck you.

28:40.571 --> 28:42.673
She's very sweet.
Sometimes, she'll put her arm around me,

28:42.739 --> 28:44.775
and she'll whisper to me,
she'll go...

28:48.378 --> 28:50.647
We all get it.
My mom was a great, big, fat person.

28:51.081 --> 28:52.082
Shh.

28:52.149 --> 28:54.251
Hilarious. Hysterical.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.956
Yeah,
it's a nice watch.

28:58.022 --> 29:00.457
Wait, let's talk about the
elephant not in the room...

29:00.524 --> 29:01.658
Ben.

29:01.725 --> 29:02.994
What the fuck, man?

29:03.061 --> 29:04.929
Okay, okay.
Obviously, I lost a few pounds.

29:04.996 --> 29:06.730
- Lost a few pounds?
- Yeah, no shit you lost

29:06.797 --> 29:08.231
- a few pounds.
- You're, like... You're hot!

29:08.298 --> 29:09.833
That's true.

29:09.901 --> 29:11.335
No, you're like
every Brazilian soccer player

29:11.401 --> 29:12.569
wrapped up into one person.
Gorgeous.

29:12.636 --> 29:14.571
Leave him alone.
You're embarrassing him.

29:14.638 --> 29:16.406
Okay, okay, all right.
Please, come on.

29:16.473 --> 29:18.208
Is Stanley coming
or what?

29:18.275 --> 29:19.710
Someone save me.

29:21.812 --> 29:23.213
Stan.

29:24.615 --> 29:26.084
Stan...

29:26.149 --> 29:28.352
Stan Uris.
Stan Urine.

29:28.418 --> 29:30.721
Stanley Urine.
No, no, he's a fucking pussy.

29:30.787 --> 29:31.688
He's not gonna show.

29:31.755 --> 29:33.690
Why would
Stanley save you, anyway?

29:33.757 --> 29:35.359
Was I not the one
who basically

29:35.425 --> 29:36.727
performed surgery on you

29:36.793 --> 29:38.128
- after Bowers cut you up?
- Yes!

29:38.195 --> 29:39.796
Holy shit!
That's right.

29:39.864 --> 29:41.365
Please tell me you ended
up becoming a doctor, Eds.

29:41.431 --> 29:44.768
No, I ended up becoming
a risk analyst.

29:44.835 --> 29:46.104
Oh, that sounds
really interesting.

29:46.169 --> 29:47.604
What does that entail?

29:47.671 --> 29:50.474
Yeah, so I work for
a big insurance firm and...

29:59.282 --> 30:01.052
Fuck you, dude.
Fuck you.

30:01.119 --> 30:03.587
Was this job
invented before fun?

30:03.654 --> 30:06.356
- That's so not funny.
- It is funny.

30:06.423 --> 30:08.926
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

30:08.993 --> 30:10.794
I propose a toast

30:12.396 --> 30:13.797
to the Losers.

30:19.836 --> 30:21.605
Let's take our
shirts off and kiss!

30:22.205 --> 30:23.407
Oh!

30:28.812 --> 30:30.247
- Oh, here we go.
- Thank you.

30:30.313 --> 30:31.883
Thank you.

30:31.949 --> 30:35.086
Like, Rogan-Marsh,
half my wife's closet Rogan-Marsh?

30:35.153 --> 30:37.287
That's...
That's huge.

30:37.354 --> 30:40.490
That's our line.
Me and my husband, Tom.

30:40.557 --> 30:41.893
How long have
you been married?

30:41.959 --> 30:43.460
Hey, we saw your movie,

30:43.527 --> 30:44.795
- by the way.
- You did?

30:44.862 --> 30:46.363
Oh, my God!
It was so good.

30:46.430 --> 30:48.365
- Oh, my God.
- It was so scary.

30:48.432 --> 30:49.733
And the ending sucked?

30:52.003 --> 30:53.770
Yeah, it did.
I'm sorry.

30:53.837 --> 30:54.939
That's all right.

31:01.012 --> 31:02.113
What?

31:02.180 --> 31:03.747
Nothing.
This is just weird.

31:03.814 --> 31:04.815
Yeah.

31:04.882 --> 31:06.550
Just all this,
all these memories,

31:06.616 --> 31:09.786
people that I don't even
remember forgetting.

31:12.090 --> 31:14.192
I mean, it's weird, right?

31:14.257 --> 31:16.027
Now that we're all here,

31:16.094 --> 31:19.030
everything just comes back
faster and faster.

31:19.097 --> 31:20.297
I mean, all of it.

31:21.364 --> 31:22.934
Yeah.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.434
Yeah, you know,
when Mike called me, I threw up.

31:25.469 --> 31:27.237
Isn't that weird?
Like, I got nervous.

31:27.304 --> 31:28.973
I got, like,
sick and I threw up.

31:30.807 --> 31:32.009
I feel fine now.

31:32.076 --> 31:33.844
I feel very relieved to be
here with you guys.

31:33.911 --> 31:35.612
Why is everybody
looking at me like this?

31:35.679 --> 31:37.447
When Mike called me,
I crashed my car.

31:37.514 --> 31:38.582
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

31:38.648 --> 31:40.118
Shit, man,
I hear you.

31:40.184 --> 31:42.019
I mean, my heart
was literally

31:42.086 --> 31:44.688
pounding right
out of my chest.

31:44.755 --> 31:46.924
- I thought it was only me.
- It was like pure...

31:48.759 --> 31:49.760
Fear.

31:51.595 --> 31:54.598
It's fear.
What you felt.

31:54.664 --> 31:58.468
Why did we all
feel like that, Mike?

31:58.535 --> 32:01.605
You remember something
we don't, don't you, Mike?

32:02.974 --> 32:06.244
Something happens to you
when you leave this town.

32:06.309 --> 32:08.512
The farther away,
the hazier it all gets.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.915
But me, I never left.

32:11.983 --> 32:12.984
So, yeah.

32:14.751 --> 32:15.853
I remember.

32:17.188 --> 32:19.389
I remember all of it.

32:22.392 --> 32:23.627
Pennywise.

32:25.629 --> 32:27.697
Oh, the fucking clown.

32:27.764 --> 32:30.001
- Oh, shit.
- Pennywise.

32:30.067 --> 32:32.036
Mike, you said you wanted
our help with something.

32:32.103 --> 32:33.637
What was that?

32:33.703 --> 32:35.273
There's an echo
here in Derry

32:35.338 --> 32:36.974
that bounces back
every 27 years.

32:37.041 --> 32:38.109
What are you talking about?

32:38.176 --> 32:39.643
Hold on.
Listen, listen.

32:39.709 --> 32:41.511
We thought
we stopped It back then.

32:41.578 --> 32:43.380
We thought It
was done, but...

32:44.481 --> 32:45.649
Mike.

32:45.715 --> 32:47.751
A week ago, a man,

32:47.818 --> 32:49.586
Adrian Mellon, slaughtered.

32:49.653 --> 32:52.089
A girl, Lisa Albrecht,
the other night, went missing.

32:52.156 --> 32:53.790
All right.

32:53.858 --> 32:55.392
There've already been others,
and there will be more.

32:55.458 --> 32:56.693
I don't want to
hear about this shit.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.963
- More death. More pain.
- Calm down.

32:59.030 --> 33:00.131
Let's get another drink.

33:00.198 --> 33:01.565
Let him explain.
Let him explain.

33:01.631 --> 33:03.333
Explain it to us, Mike.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.902
That echo,

33:06.137 --> 33:07.939
we might have changed It,

33:08.005 --> 33:09.240
just like It changed us.

33:09.307 --> 33:11.175
But we didn't stop It.

33:11.242 --> 33:13.343
Because It just bounced back.

33:15.345 --> 33:17.915
We made an oath.

33:17.982 --> 33:21.085
That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.

33:21.152 --> 33:22.954
To finish It.

33:23.020 --> 33:24.521
For good.

33:26.556 --> 33:28.458
Well, that shit got dark fast.

33:28.525 --> 33:29.726
Thanks, Mike.

33:33.297 --> 33:35.599
My fortune cookie
just says "Could."

33:37.134 --> 33:38.668
They don't know how to do
fortune cookies here.

33:38.735 --> 33:39.904
Mine just says "Guess."

33:39.971 --> 33:43.274
You wanna throw
that over here?

33:45.709 --> 33:47.377
What you got, Mikey?

33:52.682 --> 33:53.951
Wait, what?

33:54.018 --> 33:55.619
This is
what I'm talking about.

33:55.685 --> 33:58.055
"Guess. Cut.
Not. Could. It."

33:58.122 --> 33:59.589
It's a message.

33:59.656 --> 34:01.524
No,
"Guess it could not cut."

34:01.591 --> 34:03.861
Why would it guess
it could not cut?

34:03.928 --> 34:04.996
Cut what?

34:05.062 --> 34:06.463
"Guess
it could not cut."

34:06.529 --> 34:08.199
"It" goes in front.
There.

34:08.266 --> 34:09.633
"It could not guess."

34:09.699 --> 34:12.069
- It couldn't guess.
- "Could it..."

34:12.136 --> 34:13.403
No. "Could it not cut."

34:13.470 --> 34:14.972
When it says "It,"
is it talking about It?

34:15.039 --> 34:16.874
- Yeah. All right.
- Is that what it means?

34:16.941 --> 34:18.276
- Is "It" It?
- Where does this go?

34:18.342 --> 34:19.377
That's what
I'm talking about.

34:19.442 --> 34:20.810
It... It could...

34:20.878 --> 34:22.179
I don't know
what it fucking means!

34:22.246 --> 34:23.713
You fuck with
the fortune cookies, Mike?

34:23.780 --> 34:25.049
- No.
- Whoa. Let him speak, man.

34:25.116 --> 34:27.351
This is not me.
This is what It does.

34:27.417 --> 34:29.086
I need my fucking inhaler!

34:29.153 --> 34:30.955
What is wrong with you, man?
Why'd you call us?

34:31.022 --> 34:32.422
- This is not fucking funny!
- This is so not funny!

34:32.489 --> 34:33.823
- Beverly?
- This is so not funny.

35:03.520 --> 35:04.821
Why does it say Stanley?

35:05.957 --> 35:08.259
Someone else
fucking answer me!

35:09.393 --> 35:10.694
Holy shit.

35:12.063 --> 35:13.230
Holy shit.

35:21.372 --> 35:23.640
What the fuck
is that, man?

35:23.707 --> 35:25.242
Oh, my God.

35:27.979 --> 35:28.980
Whoa, whoa!

35:32.749 --> 35:34.784
Whoa!

35:39.090 --> 35:40.091
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:41.225 --> 35:42.226
Shit.

35:44.295 --> 35:45.628
Hey! Hey!

35:45.695 --> 35:48.199
That fortune cookie's
looking at me! Shit!

35:51.568 --> 35:53.636
I don't want to be here.
I can't fucking do this.

35:53.703 --> 35:55.739
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

35:56.440 --> 35:57.640
I don't wanna be here!

35:57.707 --> 35:58.641
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

35:58.708 --> 35:59.977
Holy shit!

36:01.644 --> 36:02.812
Hey! God damn it.

36:07.485 --> 36:08.953
Hey, Eddie!

36:26.137 --> 36:27.604
Whoa! Fuck!

36:27.670 --> 36:29.040
It's not real!

36:30.041 --> 36:32.043
This isn't real!
It's not real!

36:32.977 --> 36:35.112
It's not real!
It's not real!

36:35.179 --> 36:37.680
It's not real!
It's not real!

36:37.747 --> 36:41.085
It's not real!
It's not real!

36:41.152 --> 36:43.020
Is everything all right?

36:44.889 --> 36:47.557
Yeah, yeah.
Could we get the check?

36:52.762 --> 36:54.231
That's what
Pennywise does, right?

36:54.298 --> 36:55.933
He fucks with us.
So, Stanley's probably fine.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.501
Hey, Mike.
Do you have Stan's number?

36:57.567 --> 36:59.103
Yeah.

36:59.170 --> 37:00.337
Hey, Richie.

37:02.672 --> 37:04.175
How'd you...

37:04.241 --> 37:05.575
How'd you know my name?

37:05.642 --> 37:07.710
The fun's just beginning.

37:08.479 --> 37:09.779
Right?

37:14.518 --> 37:16.420
What he said, is it...

37:16.487 --> 37:18.055
Listen.
You think this is funny?

37:18.122 --> 37:19.190
All right?

37:19.256 --> 37:21.758
Think this is
some sort of game, huh?

37:21.825 --> 37:23.027
Well, fuck you,
all right?

37:23.094 --> 37:24.395
Rich,
be careful, dude.

37:24.462 --> 37:26.197
Fuck you!
I'm not afraid of you!

37:27.565 --> 37:28.999
"The fun's just beginning."

37:29.066 --> 37:31.402
The line from your act, dude.
I'm a fan.

37:31.469 --> 37:34.071
- Are those your parents?
- Yeah.

37:35.506 --> 37:36.840
You want a picture?

37:36.907 --> 37:39.009
- You okay, Dean? Come on.
- I think I'm good.

37:39.076 --> 37:41.946
Okay, cool.
He's a good kid.

37:42.012 --> 37:43.713
Jesus, Richie.
You don't remember a line

37:43.780 --> 37:45.082
from your own show?

37:45.149 --> 37:47.251
I don't write
my own material.

37:47.318 --> 37:50.054
I fucking knew it!
I fucking knew it!

37:50.121 --> 37:54.458
Hello, Mrs. Uris.
My name's Beverly Marsh.

37:54.525 --> 37:55.758
I apologize for calling,

37:55.825 --> 37:57.627
but I'm an old friend
of your husband's.

37:57.694 --> 37:59.296
You lied to us.
That's not okay.

37:59.363 --> 38:01.165
Yeah, first words out of your
mouth should have been like,

38:01.232 --> 38:03.100
"Hey, man. You want to come
to Derry and get murdered?"

38:03.167 --> 38:04.468
'Cause then
I would have said no.

38:04.535 --> 38:05.569
Guys.

38:05.635 --> 38:07.338
Fucking entrapment, man.

38:07.404 --> 38:08.506
<i>Oh...</i>

38:10.141 --> 38:11.976
<i>He passed.</i>

38:13.643 --> 38:14.844
When did it happen?

38:15.513 --> 38:17.680
<i>Yesterday.</i>

38:17.747 --> 38:20.384
<i>It was horrible,
the way he died.</i>

38:21.818 --> 38:22.987
<i>His wrists.</i>

38:23.053 --> 38:25.322
- In the bathtub.
- <i>In the bathtub.</i>

38:27.790 --> 38:31.162
<i>I'm sorry.
I have to go.</i>

38:31.228 --> 38:33.763
We're all very
sorry, Patty.

38:33.830 --> 38:35.099
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:38.369 --> 38:39.436
Stanley.

38:41.105 --> 38:43.307
Pennywise knew.
He knew before we did.

38:43.374 --> 38:45.109
We have to stop him.
I have a plan.

38:45.176 --> 38:46.843
I got a plan.
Getting the fuck out of Dodge

38:46.911 --> 38:49.180
before this ends worse
than one of Bill's books.

38:49.246 --> 38:50.680
Who's with me?

38:50.747 --> 38:51.949
We made a promise
to each other.

38:52.016 --> 38:53.617
Let's un-make the promise.

38:53.683 --> 38:54.985
Richie, other people
are gonna die.

38:55.052 --> 38:57.188
Other people
die every day, man!

38:57.254 --> 38:59.223
We don't owe
this town shit!

38:59.290 --> 39:01.926
Plus, I just remembered I grew up
here, like, two hours ago.

39:01.992 --> 39:04.761
So, I'm fucking leaving.
Fuck this.

39:04.827 --> 39:07.164
I'm sorry, man,
I'm with Richie.

39:07.231 --> 39:08.731
- Eds, please.
- Listen.

39:08.798 --> 39:11.569
What? We stay,
we die, that's it?

39:11.635 --> 39:14.038
I'm gonna go back to the inn,
I'm gonna pack up my shit,

39:14.104 --> 39:15.606
and I'm gonna
drive to my home.

39:15.673 --> 39:17.041
I'm sorry, man. Good luck.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.876
No, Eddie. Please.
Please, Eddie!

39:18.943 --> 39:20.477
Eddie, wait!

39:23.280 --> 39:24.381
You okay?

39:26.517 --> 39:27.918
I'm gonna head back
to the Town House, too.

39:27.985 --> 39:29.752
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

39:31.555 --> 39:33.657
You should have told us,
Mikey.

39:33.723 --> 39:35.893
Bill. Please, man.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.127
I'm begging you.
Please.

39:37.194 --> 39:38.662
Just listen to me, man.
Please.

39:38.728 --> 39:40.331
What are you gonna say?

39:42.166 --> 39:43.434
What could you possibly say

39:43.500 --> 39:44.602
that would make
any kind of a difference?

39:44.668 --> 39:46.836
They're all gone.

39:46.904 --> 39:49.173
Come on.
Let me show you something.

39:49.240 --> 39:52.775
One thing. And if you want to
leave, you can leave.

39:52.842 --> 39:54.311
Just let me show you
this first. Please.

40:00.517 --> 40:03.687
Lapskew!
What kind of name is that, huh?

40:03.753 --> 40:05.089
My mom swings
better than you!

40:05.155 --> 40:06.490
How many times
do I have to...

40:06.557 --> 40:09.293
She doesn't even play
baseball! You suck!

40:12.730 --> 40:15.132
Mommy, how much longer?

40:15.199 --> 40:18.035
Victoria,
we came to watch the game.

40:18.102 --> 40:20.204
We're gonna
watch the game.

41:18.729 --> 41:21.365
Hello, Vicky.

41:21.432 --> 41:23.701
Isn't that what
your friends call you?

41:23.767 --> 41:24.968
Vicky?

41:26.070 --> 41:27.871
How did I know that?

41:27.938 --> 41:31.508
I guess I must be
your friend, too.

41:31.575 --> 41:34.511
If you're my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?

41:37.081 --> 41:39.383
You're not my friend.
You're scary.

41:48.726 --> 41:50.260
Why are you crying?

41:52.596 --> 41:56.066
People always make fun
'cause of the way I look.

41:57.668 --> 42:01.071
I thought if you
couldn't see my face,

42:01.138 --> 42:04.541
then maybe you'd
want to be my friend.

42:05.743 --> 42:07.511
Never mind.

42:07.578 --> 42:13.150
Oh, silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.

42:13.217 --> 42:15.052
People make fun
of me, too.

42:16.653 --> 42:17.921
They do?

42:19.590 --> 42:21.024
'Cause of this.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.328
Well, isn't that silly?

42:25.496 --> 42:27.598
That little thing?

42:27.664 --> 42:30.334
Why, I can blow
that thing right away.

42:31.702 --> 42:32.770
You could?

42:32.836 --> 42:34.171
Oh, yes!

42:34.238 --> 42:37.174
One poof and it'd be gone!

42:40.043 --> 42:43.614
You would have to get close
enough to see my face.

42:44.515 --> 42:45.649
I don't know, Vicky.

42:45.716 --> 42:48.452
No, it's okay.
I won't make fun. I promise.

42:50.387 --> 42:51.488
Promise promise?

42:53.190 --> 42:54.925
Well, okie-dokie!

42:54.992 --> 42:56.593
Just come on in
a little closer,

42:56.660 --> 43:00.497
and we'll blow it away on
the count of three!

43:02.332 --> 43:04.468
One,

43:06.871 --> 43:09.273
two...

43:20.184 --> 43:21.518
You're supposed to say three.

43:53.984 --> 43:55.686
Holy fuck.

43:57.588 --> 43:58.388
Boo!

44:11.702 --> 44:13.303
Fuck yeah!

44:15.772 --> 44:17.274
Hey, Hockstetter.

44:17.341 --> 44:19.776
Let's go!

44:36.961 --> 44:39.396
Let's get our shit and
get the fuck out of here.

44:39.463 --> 44:40.865
Did you leave
your stuff here?

44:40.932 --> 44:42.232
No, my stuff's
still in the car.

44:56.881 --> 44:59.683
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

44:59.750 --> 45:02.519
Whatever it is you're
afraid to tell me right now.

45:06.757 --> 45:08.458
Bev. Bev.

45:08.525 --> 45:09.726
Back at the Jade when you were
on the phone with Stanley's...

45:09.793 --> 45:10.794
Stop.

45:12.629 --> 45:15.766
She told you that she
found him in the bathtub,

45:15.832 --> 45:17.367
but, Bev, I saw you.

45:17.434 --> 45:20.939
I heard it.
You said it first.

45:21.005 --> 45:22.506
Whatever you guys
are talking about,

45:22.573 --> 45:24.274
let's make it happen faster,
all right? We gotta go.

45:24.341 --> 45:26.476
<i>Eduardo, andale!</i>
Let's go!

45:26.543 --> 45:29.246
There's something
you're not telling us.

45:29.313 --> 45:31.515
You knew how Stanley died.
You knew.

45:32.849 --> 45:33.851
Wait, what?

45:34.886 --> 45:37.287
I can't do this.

45:37.354 --> 45:38.890
She knew how Stanley
was going to die,

45:38.957 --> 45:40.190
is that what
she just said?

45:40.257 --> 45:42.392
You can't just
walk away from this.

45:42.459 --> 45:43.760
How did you know

45:43.827 --> 45:44.828
where he killed himself?

45:44.896 --> 45:46.096
Bev.

45:47.065 --> 45:48.332
Talk to me.

45:48.398 --> 45:50.267
Just talk to me.
Like we used to.

45:50.334 --> 45:52.235
Come on,
how did you know?

45:52.904 --> 45:54.338
Because I saw it.

45:56.007 --> 45:58.308
I've seen all of us die.

45:59.776 --> 46:01.079
Okay, I just got to
grab my toiletry bag,

46:01.144 --> 46:02.179
and then we can go.

46:04.381 --> 46:05.582
What'd I miss?

46:19.796 --> 46:21.331
The library?

46:21.398 --> 46:22.766
Mmm-hmm.

46:25.036 --> 46:26.536
Wow.

46:26.603 --> 46:29.206
Didn't this place
used to be bigger?

46:40.918 --> 46:43.620
Yo!
Mike, where are you going?

47:08.913 --> 47:11.248
Mike, you live here?

47:11.314 --> 47:13.316
Yeah.
Make yourself at home.

47:14.785 --> 47:16.353
- You want some water?
- Yeah, sure.

47:30.101 --> 47:32.402
You see, memory's the thing.

47:32.469 --> 47:34.005
It's the key.

47:34.072 --> 47:35.572
It's the key
to everything.

47:35.639 --> 47:39.409
If It really does want
us back here,

47:39.476 --> 47:40.677
don't you think the
smartest thing we can do

47:40.744 --> 47:42.146
is just get the hell
out of Derry?

47:42.212 --> 47:44.781
No, no, no.
It does want us back.

47:44.848 --> 47:45.950
Of course It does!

47:46.017 --> 47:47.350
But It doesn't know
I know what I know.

47:47.417 --> 47:48.552
What do you know?

47:48.618 --> 47:49.921
How to kill the shit
out of It!

47:51.288 --> 47:52.890
I've read every book.

47:52.957 --> 47:55.492
I've talked to every person
in this godforsaken town,

47:55.559 --> 47:57.161
everybody that would talk to
me, anyway,

47:57.227 --> 47:59.362
and that's not a long list.

47:59.429 --> 48:00.664
But it wasn't enough.

48:00.731 --> 48:02.967
I had to know
how this all started.

48:03.034 --> 48:05.736
How It started.

48:10.273 --> 48:11.976
And It started

48:14.145 --> 48:17.115
- here.
- Whoa.

48:17.181 --> 48:20.317
- What am I looking at, Mike?
- It's an artifact.

48:20.383 --> 48:22.719
Early 18th century Shokopiwah.

48:22.786 --> 48:25.189
Shoko...
How'd you get it?

48:25.255 --> 48:26.757
I found it, in the...

48:26.823 --> 48:29.227
No, no,
they gave it to me.

48:29.292 --> 48:30.360
I stole it.

48:30.427 --> 48:32.395
You stole it?

48:32.462 --> 48:34.698
- From Native Americans?
- Uh...

48:34.765 --> 48:38.069
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, it is.

48:38.136 --> 48:39.469
They helped me
on my journey.

48:39.536 --> 48:41.304
So beautiful.

48:41.371 --> 48:44.541
They showed me things.
A vision.

48:44.608 --> 48:46.177
Ow.

48:46.244 --> 48:47.611
Holy fuck.

48:47.677 --> 48:49.713
I feel kind of funky.

48:49.780 --> 48:50.847
Hot.

48:50.915 --> 48:52.016
Am I sweating?

48:52.083 --> 48:54.218
I need you to see
what they showed me, Bill.

48:54.284 --> 48:55.619
Bill.

48:59.190 --> 49:01.391
They live outside of Derry.

49:01.458 --> 49:03.527
<i>Beyond It's reach.</i>

49:03.593 --> 49:05.796
<i>They moved there
many years ago.</i>

49:06.596 --> 49:08.465
<i>Their holy man,</i>

49:08.532 --> 49:10.868
<i>their holy of holies,</i>

49:12.036 --> 49:13.237
<i>he took me in.</i>

49:15.539 --> 49:17.041
<i>Fed me their sacred Maturin.</i>

49:18.341 --> 49:20.978
<i>I started to...
To react.</i>

49:21.045 --> 49:24.081
All living things
must abide by the laws

49:24.148 --> 49:25.715
of the shape they inhabit.

49:31.289 --> 49:33.891
<i>While I sat there,
looking out over the valley,</i>

49:33.958 --> 49:36.060
<i>I saw It arrive.</i>

49:40.231 --> 49:43.834
I knew that one day,
I would have to make you all see.

49:43.901 --> 49:44.902
Mike,

49:47.305 --> 49:49.040
did you put something
in my drink?

49:50.507 --> 49:52.043
It's, uh...

49:52.109 --> 49:53.277
It's a root.

49:53.343 --> 49:54.678
You...

49:54.744 --> 49:55.880
You drugged me?
You drugged me?

49:55.947 --> 49:57.781
No, it's a root
with properties.

49:57.848 --> 49:59.951
It's just a micro-dose of
what the Shokopiwah gave me...

50:00.017 --> 50:01.085
Why would you do that?

50:01.152 --> 50:02.987
...to open my eyes.

50:03.054 --> 50:04.654
I don't feel real good.

50:04.721 --> 50:07.892
I need you to look,

50:07.959 --> 50:09.093
and you'll see.

50:09.160 --> 50:11.062
I don't feel good.

50:11.128 --> 50:12.529
Open your eyes.

50:12.596 --> 50:14.431
Open your eyes.

50:14.497 --> 50:16.700
<i>They showed me the past.</i>

50:23.040 --> 50:26.010
<i>Showed me the way
It appeared to them.</i>

50:38.455 --> 50:40.324
<i>They showed me
their pain.</i>

50:43.928 --> 50:46.529
<i>They showed me
how to stop It!</i>

50:56.439 --> 50:57.641
It's over.

50:57.707 --> 50:59.210
It's over.
You're okay.

50:59.277 --> 51:02.313
You're okay.
Did you see it?

51:02.380 --> 51:03.680
The ritual?

51:03.747 --> 51:05.448
- The Ritual of Chud?
- Yeah, I knew you...

51:05.515 --> 51:08.085
I knew you would see it.

51:08.152 --> 51:11.289
I saw the whole fucking
thing, Mike.

51:11.355 --> 51:13.657
That's how we kill It.

51:19.829 --> 51:21.933
How are we going
to do it?

51:21.999 --> 51:25.403
Everybody already
said no.

51:25.468 --> 51:27.171
But with you,

51:29.340 --> 51:31.641
they'll listen.

51:31.708 --> 51:34.611
This won't work
without all of us.

51:38.015 --> 51:40.817
Okay. So, what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?

51:40.885 --> 51:42.286
Yeah,
'cause I gotta be honest.

51:42.353 --> 51:43.854
That's a fucked-up thing
to just drop on somebody.

51:45.323 --> 51:47.158
Every night since Derry,

51:49.526 --> 51:50.995
I've been having
these nightmares.

51:52.595 --> 51:55.699
People in pain.
People dying.

51:56.167 --> 51:57.268
People...

51:57.335 --> 51:58.702
So, you have nightmares.

51:58.768 --> 52:00.237
I have nightmares.
People, they have nightmares.

52:00.304 --> 52:02.974
But that doesn't mean
that your visions are true.

52:05.542 --> 52:08.778
I've watched
every single one of us...

52:08.845 --> 52:11.048
You've seen
every single one of us what?

52:15.853 --> 52:18.122
At the place that
Stanley wound up.

52:20.191 --> 52:22.393
That's how we end.

52:22.460 --> 52:25.162
Okay, how come the rest of
us aren't seeing that shit?

52:25.229 --> 52:26.696
I mean,
what makes her so different?

52:26.763 --> 52:27.965
The Deadlights.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.701
The Deadlights.

52:44.882 --> 52:46.150
She was the only
one of us

52:46.217 --> 52:48.551
that got caught in
the Deadlights that day.

52:49.719 --> 52:51.222
We were all
touched by It.

52:51.288 --> 52:52.722
Changed.

52:52.789 --> 52:56.626
Deep down. Like an infection.
Or a virus.

52:56.693 --> 52:59.030
A virus.
You understand.

52:59.096 --> 53:00.364
Slowly growing.

53:00.431 --> 53:03.700
That virus,
it's been growing for 27 years.

53:03.767 --> 53:05.835
This whole time,
metastasizing.

53:05.903 --> 53:07.304
It just got to Stan
first, because...

53:07.371 --> 53:08.506
He was the weakest.

53:08.571 --> 53:10.074
Jesus Christ, Rich.

53:10.141 --> 53:11.976
Just saying what everyone
else is thinking, man.

53:12.043 --> 53:13.477
I mean,
Rich, come on.

53:13.543 --> 53:16.380
What Beverly sees,
it will come to pass.

53:16.447 --> 53:18.315
It's what'll happen to
all of us, eventually,

53:18.382 --> 53:19.682
unless we stop It.

53:19.749 --> 53:21.252
How the hell are we
supposed to do that?

53:22.286 --> 53:23.653
The Ritual of Chud.

53:25.256 --> 53:26.823
The Shokopiwah.

53:26.891 --> 53:30.094
The first ones who fought
It, they have a saying.

53:30.161 --> 53:32.096
"All living things
must abide by

53:32.163 --> 53:33.497
"the laws of the
shape they inhabit."

53:33.563 --> 53:34.865
A tribal ritual?

53:36.699 --> 53:38.069
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

53:38.135 --> 53:39.870
All right,
there's gotta be another way.

53:39.937 --> 53:41.972
Okay? This thing comes
back, what, every 27 years?

53:42.039 --> 53:44.008
Let's just kick the can down
the road and do it then.

53:44.075 --> 53:45.708
Wait, we'll be 70 years
old, asshole.

53:45.775 --> 53:47.577
It doesn't
work that way.

53:48.913 --> 53:50.713
None of us make it
another 20 years,

53:51.648 --> 53:53.150
and the way it happens...

53:55.453 --> 53:58.389
So, if we don't beat It
this cycle, then...

53:58.456 --> 53:59.924
We die.

53:59.990 --> 54:01.058
Horribly.

54:01.125 --> 54:02.860
Yeah, I don't need
the "horribly" part.

54:02.927 --> 54:04.594
I didn't say it.
She said it. Not me.

54:04.661 --> 54:05.996
All right, guys.
Look.

54:06.063 --> 54:08.866
I've seen
what he's talking about,

54:10.201 --> 54:12.036
and it's all true.

54:12.870 --> 54:14.771
It's the only way.

54:16.173 --> 54:17.807
If we want
this ritual to work...

54:17.875 --> 54:19.210
We have to remember.

54:20.610 --> 54:23.047
Remember what?

54:27.885 --> 54:29.719
<i>It's better
if I show you.</i>

54:30.988 --> 54:32.755
<i>We don't have
much time.</i>

54:35.092 --> 54:36.693
<i>His cycle
will end soon.</i>

54:38.562 --> 54:39.864
<i>And once it does...</i>

54:39.930 --> 54:41.198
<i>We're fucked.</i>

55:03.921 --> 55:05.722
The Barrens.

55:05.788 --> 55:07.424
This is where we came.

55:08.459 --> 55:10.161
After the rock fight.

55:11.495 --> 55:12.695
The clubhouse.

55:13.497 --> 55:15.132
You built that for us.

55:15.199 --> 55:16.634
Yeah, the hatch has got to
be around here someplace.

55:16.699 --> 55:18.602
You did.
I do remember that!

55:18.668 --> 55:20.237
- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa!

55:21.639 --> 55:23.007
You okay?

55:26.143 --> 55:27.744
- What?
- Nothing, it's just...

55:28.946 --> 55:30.281
You haven't changed.

55:31.348 --> 55:32.550
It's a good thing.

55:37.154 --> 55:39.890
You know what?
I actually think the door was more like

55:41.091 --> 55:42.193
around...

55:48.465 --> 55:49.699
Found it.

55:50.401 --> 55:51.468
I'm okay!

55:52.203 --> 55:53.270
Come down!

56:10.454 --> 56:11.788
What the dick is this?

56:11.855 --> 56:13.224
How'd you build it?

56:14.391 --> 56:16.193
When did you build it?

56:16.260 --> 56:18.362
Here and there,
I guess.

56:18.429 --> 56:19.863
It was already dug
out from something,

56:19.930 --> 56:22.199
so I just had to
reinforce the walls

56:22.266 --> 56:23.901
and get some wood
for the roof door,

56:23.968 --> 56:25.703
and that's pretty much it.

56:25.768 --> 56:27.770
Pretty good for
my first time, huh?

56:30.207 --> 56:31.808
Now,
that's a cool feature.

56:31.875 --> 56:33.010
What happens when
you put your hand

56:33.077 --> 56:34.811
on the other pillar,
professor?

56:34.878 --> 56:37.014
Okay, you see, this is exactly
why there are safety codes,

56:37.081 --> 56:38.549
why we have permits.

56:38.616 --> 56:40.217
This place is a death trap.
You understand that?

56:40.284 --> 56:41.952
Well, it's a work in progress.
Okay, Eddie?

56:42.019 --> 56:43.587
Just so you know, I get
hurt, you are liable.

56:43.654 --> 56:45.589
And, also, what is this?
The switch of an iron maiden?

56:45.656 --> 56:46.756
That's a flashlight.

56:46.823 --> 56:47.992
What is that,
a horse hitch?

56:48.058 --> 56:49.493
When do you have
horses down...

56:49.560 --> 56:50.728
Oh, this is cool.

56:50.793 --> 56:52.029
That was like,
three dollars,

56:52.096 --> 56:53.597
so be careful with that, please.

56:53.664 --> 56:55.165
I have one of these.
Hey, Stan, you see this?

56:55.232 --> 56:56.867
Yeah, okay,
can you maybe not?

56:56.934 --> 56:58.569
Maybe not what? Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Maybe not what?

56:58.636 --> 57:00.004
Be awesome and have fun

57:00.070 --> 57:01.905
and celebrate the magic
of the paddle-ball?

57:02.772 --> 57:04.241
Wow.

57:04.308 --> 57:06.043
Oh, good going, fucknut.
You broke his thing.

57:06.110 --> 57:07.211
- I broke it?
- Yeah,

57:07.278 --> 57:08.545
you broke it
with your face.

57:08.612 --> 57:10.347
What?

57:10.414 --> 57:11.949
I'm not putting
my fucking hand down there.

57:19.056 --> 57:20.491
Oh, man.
That's so cool.

57:21.458 --> 57:23.494
Oh, my God.

57:23.560 --> 57:26.964
How do we all not
remember that this was here?

57:27.031 --> 57:28.932
Hey, Losers.

57:31.368 --> 57:33.237
Time to float.

57:38.042 --> 57:40.010
- Ahh!
- Fuck, Richie.

57:40.077 --> 57:41.645
- Dude!
- Remember when he used to say

57:41.712 --> 57:44.248
that shit?
And he'd do that little dance.

57:46.550 --> 57:48.352
Am I the only one
who remembers this shit?

57:48.419 --> 57:51.488
Are you gonna be like this
the entire time we're home?

57:51.555 --> 57:53.724
All right. Just trying to
add some levity to this shit.

57:53.791 --> 57:55.426
I'll go fuck myself.

57:57.561 --> 57:59.296
It smells so fucking
terrible in here.

58:02.900 --> 58:04.535
Hey, you guys?

58:06.070 --> 58:09.406
This says "Stan."

58:10.407 --> 58:12.443
"For the use
of Losers only."

58:14.978 --> 58:16.180
Bill.

58:25.255 --> 58:27.024
The fuck is this?

58:27.091 --> 58:28.292
So you don't get
spiders stuck

58:28.359 --> 58:29.893
in your hair
when you're down here.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.028
Stanley, we're not afraid
of fucking spiders.

58:34.665 --> 58:35.999
I stand corrected.

58:36.934 --> 58:38.135
That's a first.

58:38.635 --> 58:40.237
Touche.

58:40.304 --> 58:41.905
Hey, Rich,
your ten minutes are up.

58:41.972 --> 58:43.374
What are you talking about?

58:43.440 --> 58:45.075
The hammock.
Ten minutes each was the rule.

58:45.142 --> 58:46.543
- I don't see any sign.
- Are you

58:46.610 --> 58:48.379
being this way right now?
Really? No, no, no.

58:48.445 --> 58:50.180
Why would there be a sign if
it was a verbal agreement?

58:50.247 --> 58:53.083
And I remember you agreeing
on the fucking rule!

58:54.651 --> 58:55.953
I can see your vagina!

58:56.019 --> 58:57.588
Ten minutes each.

58:57.654 --> 58:59.323
Go back in
your dumb little corner!

59:00.023 --> 59:01.558
I fucked your mom!

59:01.625 --> 59:04.461
No, you didn't.
Take that back!

59:04.528 --> 59:06.530
You're awfully good at
this, new kid.

59:07.631 --> 59:08.966
You really think so?

59:10.334 --> 59:12.503
There's actually a summer
program in Bar Harbor.

59:12.569 --> 59:14.338
Teaches you, like,
everything about architecture.

59:14.405 --> 59:15.639
I was thinking about applying.

59:15.706 --> 59:17.174
I'll do that.

59:17.241 --> 59:20.043
I'll do anything to get
the hell out of Derry.

59:20.110 --> 59:22.179
Man, when I graduate,
I'm going to Florida.

59:22.246 --> 59:24.047
What's in Florida, Mike?

59:25.115 --> 59:26.717
I don't know.

59:26.784 --> 59:28.519
You know, I guess it's just a
place I always wanted to go.

59:28.585 --> 59:30.654
Stan, you should go
with Mike to Florida.

59:30.721 --> 59:32.256
You already act 80.

59:32.322 --> 59:33.858
You'd clean up with all the grandmas.

59:37.428 --> 59:39.563
Do you guys think
we'll still be friends?

59:41.832 --> 59:43.167
When we're older?

59:43.233 --> 59:45.502
What?

59:45.569 --> 59:47.938
Why wouldn't we be?

59:48.005 --> 59:49.206
Do any of your parents
still hang out

59:49.273 --> 59:50.507
with their friends
from middle school?

59:52.075 --> 59:55.045
I mean, things might
be different then.

59:56.180 --> 59:58.115
We all might be different.

59:59.416 --> 1:00:02.786
We'll always still be friends.

1:00:02.854 --> 1:00:05.122
I don't think that just,
you know,

1:00:05.189 --> 1:00:07.324
goes away
because we get older.

1:00:09.159 --> 1:00:10.594
Yeah, Stan. Come on.

1:00:13.063 --> 1:00:15.732
You don't have
to be so...

1:00:15.799 --> 1:00:17.201
Sad.

1:00:21.171 --> 1:00:23.474
He was old
before his time.

1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:25.509
Yeah.

1:00:25.576 --> 1:00:28.245
I wonder what he was
like all grown up.

1:00:28.312 --> 1:00:30.247
Probably what he
was like as a kid.

1:00:33.750 --> 1:00:34.751
The best.

1:00:36.053 --> 1:00:37.287
Here.

1:00:38.822 --> 1:00:41.191
All right, Mike.
What are we doing here?

1:00:42.493 --> 1:00:43.627
The ritual.

1:00:43.694 --> 1:00:46.129
To perform it
requires a sacrifice.

1:00:46.196 --> 1:00:48.765
- Sacrifice? I nominate Eddie.
- Wait, what?

1:00:48.832 --> 1:00:50.767
Because you're little.
You'll fit on a barbeque.

1:00:50.834 --> 1:00:53.070
I'm 5'9". It's, like,
average height in most of the world.

1:00:53.136 --> 1:00:55.639
It's not that kind of
a sacrifice, guys.

1:00:56.607 --> 1:00:57.741
Mike?

1:00:58.709 --> 1:01:00.444
The past is buried.

1:01:00.511 --> 1:01:02.713
But you're gonna have
to dig it up.

1:01:02.779 --> 1:01:04.781
Piece by piece.

1:01:04.848 --> 1:01:06.116
And these pieces,

1:01:06.183 --> 1:01:07.784
these artifacts,

1:01:08.887 --> 1:01:10.387
that's why we're here.

1:01:12.289 --> 1:01:14.057
They are
what you'll sacrifice.

1:01:15.392 --> 1:01:17.594
And since Stan
isn't here to find his...

1:01:17.661 --> 1:01:19.663
I figured we should
all be here together

1:01:19.730 --> 1:01:21.265
to find his artifact.

1:01:23.868 --> 1:01:25.536
I think Bill just did that.

1:01:30.541 --> 1:01:32.643
Okay, Mike, so where
do we find our tokens?

1:01:32.709 --> 1:01:34.411
Yeah, I gotta be honest, man.
All due respect.

1:01:34.478 --> 1:01:36.647
This is fucking stupid,
all right?

1:01:36.713 --> 1:01:38.282
Why do we need tokens?
All right?

1:01:38.348 --> 1:01:39.884
We already remember
everything.

1:01:39.951 --> 1:01:41.184
Saving Bev,
defeating It...

1:01:41.251 --> 1:01:43.153
I mean,
we're caught up!

1:01:43.220 --> 1:01:44.555
It's not everything.

1:01:46.156 --> 1:01:48.258
We fought.
But what happened after that?

1:01:49.359 --> 1:01:51.295
Before the house
on Neibolt.

1:01:52.596 --> 1:01:53.697
Think.

1:01:55.732 --> 1:01:58.702
We can't
remember, can we?

1:01:58.769 --> 1:02:00.804
See, there's more to our story.

1:02:00.872 --> 1:02:02.239
What happened that summer.

1:02:03.173 --> 1:02:04.876
And those blank spaces,

1:02:04.943 --> 1:02:07.077
like pages torn out of a book.

1:02:07.144 --> 1:02:09.613
That's what
you need to find.

1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:11.381
We need to split up.

1:02:11.448 --> 1:02:13.750
You each need to
find your artifact.

1:02:13.817 --> 1:02:15.719
Alone.
That's important.

1:02:15.786 --> 1:02:16.787
When you do,

1:02:18.121 --> 1:02:19.590
meet me
at the library tonight.

1:02:19.656 --> 1:02:21.525
Yeah,
I gotta say,

1:02:21.592 --> 1:02:23.293
statistically speaking,
you look at survival scenarios,

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:25.029
we're gonna do much
better as a group.

1:02:25.095 --> 1:02:26.830
Yeah, splitting up
would be dumb, man.

1:02:26.898 --> 1:02:28.732
Okay, we gotta go together.
All right?

1:02:28.799 --> 1:02:30.767
We were together that
summer, right?

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:33.270
No.

1:02:33.337 --> 1:02:37.075
Not that
whole summer.

1:02:37.140 --> 1:02:38.675
Take it back.

1:02:38.742 --> 1:02:40.243
Bill!

1:02:41.678 --> 1:02:43.413
You're just
a bunch of losers.

1:02:44.015 --> 1:02:45.115
Fuck off!

1:02:45.182 --> 1:02:46.717
- Fucking...
- Stop!

1:02:48.485 --> 1:02:51.188
We were all together
when we hurt It.

1:02:51.254 --> 1:02:53.423
That's why
we're still alive.

1:02:53.490 --> 1:02:56.193
Yeah? Well,
I plan to keep it that way.

1:03:05.302 --> 1:03:06.370
I bet by tomorrow,

1:03:06.436 --> 1:03:07.738
we'll all be
back together.

1:03:10.273 --> 1:03:11.775
I don't think so.

1:03:11.842 --> 1:03:13.911
Well, if we're gonna stop
It, we better be.

1:03:15.846 --> 1:03:17.347
Maybe Richie was right.

1:03:18.950 --> 1:03:22.686
Maybe we shouldn't do anything about
It, or maybe we can't.

1:03:22.753 --> 1:03:25.089
Okay, don't let them
get to you.

1:03:25.155 --> 1:03:26.858
It's a little late
for that.

1:03:30.794 --> 1:03:32.229
You should go.

1:03:33.830 --> 1:03:35.666
Before your dad sees.

1:04:10.233 --> 1:04:11.435
Yes?

1:04:12.970 --> 1:04:14.271
Sorry. I...

1:04:15.806 --> 1:04:17.841
May I help you?

1:04:17.909 --> 1:04:19.209
I thought I rang Marsh.

1:04:19.276 --> 1:04:21.211
Marsh?

1:04:21.879 --> 1:04:23.346
Alvin Marsh?

1:04:23.881 --> 1:04:25.348
My father.

1:04:26.084 --> 1:04:27.784
I grew up here.

1:04:34.257 --> 1:04:35.625
Dear,

1:04:35.692 --> 1:04:39.163
it's not for me to
tell you this,

1:04:39.229 --> 1:04:41.565
but your father
passed away.

1:04:43.067 --> 1:04:46.336
I'm so sorry.
You didn't know?

1:04:49.140 --> 1:04:52.076
We hadn't spoken
in a while.

1:04:52.143 --> 1:04:54.277
Well, won't you
come in?

1:04:54.344 --> 1:04:56.379
Let me offer you
something to drink.

1:04:56.446 --> 1:04:59.382
No, it's fine.
I have to go.

1:04:59.449 --> 1:05:01.953
It's the least
I can do.

1:05:04.488 --> 1:05:06.289
Sure. Okay.

1:05:18.268 --> 1:05:20.804
Is it like you remember?

1:05:20.872 --> 1:05:22.639
Cleaner.

1:05:22.706 --> 1:05:24.876
Well, you feel free
to look around

1:05:24.942 --> 1:05:26.777
while I get
the water boiling.

1:05:26.843 --> 1:05:28.478
Oh, really, it's fine.
You don't need to do that.

1:05:28.545 --> 1:05:31.348
Don't be so polite.

1:05:59.609 --> 1:06:01.411
Today is her birthday.

1:06:05.582 --> 1:06:07.450
I can still smell
her perfume.

1:06:10.620 --> 1:06:13.057
And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

1:06:15.126 --> 1:06:16.660
Mama was sick.

1:06:16.726 --> 1:06:20.330
You know that's why
she did what she did.

1:06:20.397 --> 1:06:22.566
She did what she did

1:06:22.632 --> 1:06:26.736
because she was embarrassed
to be your mother.

1:06:28.438 --> 1:06:29.907
You look like her.

1:06:32.576 --> 1:06:35.046
But you are nothing
like her.

1:06:37.882 --> 1:06:39.382
Come here.

1:06:41.919 --> 1:06:43.855
I said come here!

1:06:46.556 --> 1:06:47.959
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:06.443
You know that I
would never hurt you.

1:07:06.509 --> 1:07:07.777
You know that,
don't you?

1:07:17.554 --> 1:07:20.057
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1:07:20.124 --> 1:07:23.426
You'll always be my little
girl, won't you?

1:07:24.128 --> 1:07:25.595
Always.

1:08:35.632 --> 1:08:37.969
"Your hair is winter fire,

1:08:38.768 --> 1:08:41.538
"January embers...

1:08:41.604 --> 1:08:44.175
<i>"My heart burns
there, too."</i>

1:09:01.225 --> 1:09:04.028
There. I do apologize.

1:09:04.095 --> 1:09:09.433
It gets so very hot
here this time of year.

1:09:09.499 --> 1:09:10.968
It's fine.

1:09:11.035 --> 1:09:14.872
Well, you feel like you
could just about die.

1:09:14.939 --> 1:09:18.042
But you know what
they say about Derry.

1:09:18.109 --> 1:09:22.246
"No one who dies here
ever really dies."

1:09:34.824 --> 1:09:38.295
But tell me,
how is it being back in Derry?

1:09:40.498 --> 1:09:42.466
It's good.
Strange.

1:09:42.532 --> 1:09:44.402
Strange?

1:09:44.468 --> 1:09:45.735
Oh, my.

1:09:45.802 --> 1:09:48.205
Strange, how?

1:09:49.907 --> 1:09:51.976
Oh.

1:09:52.043 --> 1:09:55.146
I had some cookies in
the oven before you came.

1:09:55.212 --> 1:09:56.546
You stay right there.

1:09:56.613 --> 1:09:58.782
I really... I shouldn't impose...
I'm gonna...

1:09:58.848 --> 1:10:01.618
No, no, no. I insist.

1:10:06.924 --> 1:10:09.126
Mrs. Kersh,
are these your family?

1:10:09.193 --> 1:10:10.660
Yes, dear.

1:10:10.727 --> 1:10:14.731
My father came to this country
with $14 in his pocket.

1:10:14.798 --> 1:10:17.034
And he didn't ask
for a handout

1:10:17.101 --> 1:10:19.803
the way that people
come in here these days.

1:10:19.870 --> 1:10:21.472
You know what he did?

1:10:21.539 --> 1:10:23.640
What did he do,
Mrs. Kersh?

1:10:23.706 --> 1:10:26.743
My father joined the circus.

1:10:44.061 --> 1:10:47.164
I was always
Daddy's little girl.

1:10:48.299 --> 1:10:49.366
What about you?

1:10:53.237 --> 1:10:56.840
Are you still
his little girl, Beverly?

1:11:00.144 --> 1:11:01.678
Are you?

1:11:13.991 --> 1:11:15.960
Mustn't lie
to our father!

1:11:22.366 --> 1:11:23.666
Help!

1:11:23.733 --> 1:11:27.004
Run, run, run.

1:11:27.438 --> 1:11:29.672
Run, run.

1:11:31.909 --> 1:11:36.113
You haven't
changed anything yet.

1:11:38.815 --> 1:11:43.020
You haven't
changed their futures.

1:11:45.923 --> 1:11:50.793
You... You haven't
saved any of them.

1:11:54.731 --> 1:11:56.799
Close your eyes, Bev.

1:11:57.368 --> 1:11:58.435
Fuck you!

1:11:58.502 --> 1:12:00.703
If you don't believe,

1:12:03.507 --> 1:12:05.209
close them

1:12:06.310 --> 1:12:08.112
and see!

1:13:08.038 --> 1:13:09.506
Come on, you.
Come on.

1:13:11.808 --> 1:13:13.277
Ken,
you little bitch...

1:13:13.344 --> 1:13:14.378
Yes!

1:13:14.445 --> 1:13:15.613
You're fucking good.

1:13:15.679 --> 1:13:17.780
<i>Game over.</i>

1:13:20.084 --> 1:13:22.286
- Ah, well, I gotta go.
- Hey!

1:13:22.785 --> 1:13:24.054
Um...

1:13:26.457 --> 1:13:28.192
How about we
go again?

1:13:28.259 --> 1:13:29.727
Play some more,
you know?

1:13:29.792 --> 1:13:31.295
Fuck you, man.

1:13:31.362 --> 1:13:32.396
Only if you want to.

1:13:36.833 --> 1:13:39.203
Dude, why are you
being weird?

1:13:39.270 --> 1:13:40.938
I'm not
your fucking boyfriend.

1:13:41.005 --> 1:13:42.839
Whoa, I...
I didn't...

1:13:42.906 --> 1:13:44.774
What the fuck's
going on here?

1:13:44.841 --> 1:13:46.076
You assholes
didn't tell me

1:13:46.143 --> 1:13:47.878
your town is
full of little fairies.

1:13:47.945 --> 1:13:49.446
Richie fucking Tozier?

1:13:49.513 --> 1:13:52.283
What? You're trying to
bone my little cousin?

1:13:54.351 --> 1:13:56.053
Get the fuck out of
here, faggot!

1:14:00.391 --> 1:14:01.892
Fucking move!

1:14:24.847 --> 1:14:26.383
Want a kiss, Richie?

1:14:57.548 --> 1:14:59.516
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1:14:59.583 --> 1:15:01.819
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1:15:01.885 --> 1:15:04.621
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1:15:13.464 --> 1:15:16.233
I think I just shit
my pants.

1:15:30.347 --> 1:15:31.515
- Canal Days Festival.
- Shit.

1:15:31.582 --> 1:15:33.317
Closing performance
is tonight.

1:15:33.384 --> 1:15:35.352
Hope to see you there, handsome.

1:15:42.159 --> 1:15:43.660
Did you miss
me, Richie?

1:15:43.727 --> 1:15:45.329
Oh, fuck!

1:15:48.867 --> 1:15:51.135
'Cause I've missed you.

1:15:52.336 --> 1:15:56.875
No one wants to play
with the clown anymore.

1:15:56.940 --> 1:15:59.276
Play a game with me,
would ya?

1:15:59.343 --> 1:16:00.677
How about <i>Street Fighter?</i>

1:16:00.744 --> 1:16:03.013
Oh, yes.
You like that one, don't you?

1:16:05.716 --> 1:16:09.386
Or maybe
Truth or Dare?

1:16:10.020 --> 1:16:11.121
Jesus.

1:16:11.188 --> 1:16:13.123
Oh, you wouldn't want

1:16:13.190 --> 1:16:16.727
anyone to pick "truth,"
though, would ya, Richie?

1:16:16.794 --> 1:16:21.698
You wouldn't want anyone
to know what you're hiding.

1:16:24.201 --> 1:16:27.171

1:16:27.237 --> 1:16:30.741

1:16:39.650 --> 1:16:43.420
This isn't happening.
This isn't real.

1:16:43.487 --> 1:16:46.123
It isn't real. It isn't happening.
It isn't real.

1:16:51.328 --> 1:16:53.230
Come back and play!

1:16:53.297 --> 1:16:57.067
Come back
and play with the clown!

1:17:01.805 --> 1:17:03.841
Whoa!

1:17:03.908 --> 1:17:06.610
- I'm so sorry. Sorry.
- Watch it, you jerk!

1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:10.647
Sorry.

1:17:36.875 --> 1:17:38.141
Oh, man!

1:17:38.208 --> 1:17:40.544
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

1:17:40.611 --> 1:17:43.413
Yeah, I want to see about the...

1:17:44.648 --> 1:17:45.649
Baseball card?

1:17:47.050 --> 1:17:48.285
The bowling ball?

1:17:48.352 --> 1:17:49.419
No, the...

1:17:49.486 --> 1:17:51.722
Banjo?

1:17:51.788 --> 1:17:53.690
Beaver?

1:17:53.757 --> 1:17:55.359
Fucking bike.

1:17:55.425 --> 1:17:58.095
You wanna use
that kind of language,

1:17:59.964 --> 1:18:01.598
take it out
in the street.

1:18:01.665 --> 1:18:03.166
I'm sorry.

1:18:03.233 --> 1:18:05.602
Can we just start over and
pretend that I just walked in?

1:18:07.037 --> 1:18:08.405
How can I help you?

1:18:08.472 --> 1:18:11.141
Thank you. Yes.
I want to buy the bike.

1:18:11.208 --> 1:18:13.510
Aren't you William
Denbrough, the writer?

1:18:13.577 --> 1:18:14.946
Yeah, that's...

1:18:15.013 --> 1:18:16.246
That's me.

1:18:16.313 --> 1:18:19.216
That bike
used to be mine.

1:18:19.283 --> 1:18:22.786
Well, it's mine now.

1:18:22.854 --> 1:18:24.054
But you're
the big author.

1:18:24.121 --> 1:18:25.622
You want it,
you can afford it.

1:18:26.858 --> 1:18:28.725
All right.
How much?

1:18:32.796 --> 1:18:33.797
$300.

1:18:35.332 --> 1:18:36.767
You can afford it.

1:18:37.801 --> 1:18:39.037
I'll get it.

1:18:39.102 --> 1:18:41.772
I guess
that's kind of a deal.

1:18:52.249 --> 1:18:53.952
You... You want me to
sign it for you?

1:18:54.018 --> 1:18:55.085
Nah.

1:18:55.152 --> 1:18:56.753
I didn't like the ending.

1:19:00.090 --> 1:19:01.325
Uh...

1:19:02.225 --> 1:19:03.928
Three big ones.

1:19:03.995 --> 1:19:05.696
- All yours.
- Uh-huh.

1:19:05.762 --> 1:19:07.798
I don't know
how fast she'll go.

1:19:08.632 --> 1:19:10.601
Been there
a lot of years.

1:19:11.768 --> 1:19:13.737
You know what,
mister?

1:19:14.771 --> 1:19:17.240
She was fast enough
to beat the devil.

1:19:24.715 --> 1:19:25.782
Come on.

1:19:32.623 --> 1:19:34.625
Yeah,
I missed you, too.

1:19:41.899 --> 1:19:43.200
Yeah!

1:19:43.667 --> 1:19:44.768
Whoo!

1:19:54.012 --> 1:19:56.513
Hi-ho, Silver!

1:19:56.580 --> 1:19:58.448
Away!

1:20:21.171 --> 1:20:22.839
Bye, Billy!

1:20:55.073 --> 1:20:56.373
I know you're
down there.

1:20:56.440 --> 1:20:58.842
I know you
can hear me.

1:21:00.878 --> 1:21:02.479
There's something
I have to know.

1:21:04.916 --> 1:21:06.817
All of the kids in this
town you could have taken,

1:21:06.884 --> 1:21:08.752
why Georgie?

1:21:14.125 --> 1:21:16.393
Say something!

1:21:18.729 --> 1:21:19.763
Why him?

1:21:19.830 --> 1:21:21.966
Why him?
Why him? Why him?

1:21:42.252 --> 1:21:43.820
Why?

1:21:47.892 --> 1:21:52.729
Because you weren't
there, Billy.

1:22:07.945 --> 1:22:09.713
Billy,
don't leave.

1:22:11.381 --> 1:22:12.582
Hello?

1:22:15.153 --> 1:22:16.386
Billy.

1:22:20.858 --> 1:22:21.926
I'm still here.

1:22:25.163 --> 1:22:26.864
Help me.

1:22:27.965 --> 1:22:28.966
Georgie.

1:22:34.939 --> 1:22:35.973
Georgie?

1:22:37.141 --> 1:22:38.642
Help me, Billy.

1:22:39.543 --> 1:22:41.245
Take my hand.

1:22:41.311 --> 1:22:43.080
Take my hand.

1:22:43.147 --> 1:22:44.548
I've got you, buddy.
Come on.

1:22:44.614 --> 1:22:45.816
He's coming.

1:22:46.817 --> 1:22:48.186
Take my hand!

1:22:48.252 --> 1:22:49.653
- I got you. Come on.
- Billy, please. He's coming.

1:22:49.719 --> 1:22:51.055
- Take my hand.
- Billy!

1:22:51.122 --> 1:22:52.622
Come on,
take my hand!

1:23:15.146 --> 1:23:16.780
I hate you!

1:23:17.581 --> 1:23:19.884
I hate you.

1:23:19.951 --> 1:23:21.351
Who are
you talking to?

1:23:23.321 --> 1:23:24.487
Move, move, move!

1:23:24.554 --> 1:23:26.690
Move! Move!

1:23:26.756 --> 1:23:28.825
You hear voices from that
sewer, you stay away from it.

1:23:30.527 --> 1:23:32.864
You hear voices
from the sewer?

1:23:33.331 --> 1:23:34.464
No.

1:23:34.531 --> 1:23:37.101
No. Just stay away
from that sewer.

1:23:40.304 --> 1:23:41.873
I only hear voices
in the tub.

1:23:43.807 --> 1:23:46.077
You know.
From the drain.

1:23:47.777 --> 1:23:49.679
What kind of voices?

1:23:50.413 --> 1:23:51.648
Kids.

1:23:52.649 --> 1:23:54.986
And other times,
like a...

1:23:55.052 --> 1:23:56.087
Like a clown?

1:24:02.059 --> 1:24:03.560
You listen to me.
You listen good.

1:24:03.627 --> 1:24:05.997
You need to
get out of this town.

1:24:06.063 --> 1:24:07.831
All right? Tell your parents.
Make up a reason.

1:24:07.899 --> 1:24:09.566
You make up a fucking lie.
I don't care what you do.

1:24:09.633 --> 1:24:10.868
Just get out of this town.
Make them

1:24:10.935 --> 1:24:12.702
never bring you back.
Do you understand?

1:24:12.769 --> 1:24:14.638
You leave Derry and
you stay out of Derry!

1:24:14.704 --> 1:24:15.973
Do you understand me?

1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:17.440
I'm supposed to be
at the festival.

1:24:17.507 --> 1:24:20.011
Tell me you understand!

1:24:25.016 --> 1:24:27.318
I'm supposed to be
at the festival.

1:24:27.385 --> 1:24:29.053
I gotta go.

1:24:31.923 --> 1:24:33.157
Just be careful!

1:25:15.665 --> 1:25:17.600
Come on,
let's get the fuck outta here.

1:25:18.468 --> 1:25:20.637
Wake up, fat-ass.

1:25:23.341 --> 1:25:25.042
Fucking loser.

1:25:47.965 --> 1:25:49.400
Whoa.

1:25:49.467 --> 1:25:52.569
Easy. It's just me.

1:25:52.635 --> 1:25:55.439
What are you and your little
buddies up to in here?

1:25:55.505 --> 1:25:58.742
Oh. Those guys are
definitely not my buddies.

1:25:58.808 --> 1:26:00.543
No, I meant
your real friends.

1:26:00.610 --> 1:26:02.279
Joey. Jonathan.
Donnie. Danny.

1:26:02.346 --> 1:26:03.914
Oh.

1:26:07.451 --> 1:26:09.020
Are you smoking
in school?

1:26:10.421 --> 1:26:12.223
Secret hideout.

1:26:13.257 --> 1:26:14.624
Don't tell anyone.

1:26:22.532 --> 1:26:24.135
You okay, new kid?

1:26:24.201 --> 1:26:25.702
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

1:26:27.271 --> 1:26:29.806
I guess I'm just worried

1:26:31.409 --> 1:26:35.745
that we're not all gonna be
the same after the fight.

1:26:35.812 --> 1:26:37.882
As long as we can still hang
out, who cares?

1:26:39.816 --> 1:26:41.018
You really mean that?

1:26:43.954 --> 1:26:46.556
Well, yeah,
of course, dummy.

1:26:51.295 --> 1:26:52.629
You and me.

1:26:58.302 --> 1:26:59.702
Oh, my God!

1:27:01.539 --> 1:27:02.907
I meant as a friend.

1:27:04.674 --> 1:27:06.177
You actually thought
I could like someone

1:27:06.243 --> 1:27:10.247
as fat and gross and
disgusting like you?

1:27:11.848 --> 1:27:13.616
No matter
how many stupid poems

1:27:13.683 --> 1:27:14.919
you write.

1:27:22.659 --> 1:27:24.794
"Your hair is winter fire.

1:27:31.168 --> 1:27:32.735
"January embers.

1:27:35.139 --> 1:27:37.774
"My heart
burns there, too."

1:28:03.067 --> 1:28:05.035
That's not the real Beverly.

1:28:05.102 --> 1:28:07.704
Beverly would never
say anything like that.

1:28:07.770 --> 1:28:09.206
She'd never say that.

1:28:24.054 --> 1:28:26.756
Kiss me, fat boy.

1:28:36.833 --> 1:28:42.273
Oh, nobody wants to
kiss the fat boy.

1:28:42.339 --> 1:28:43.641
Just leave me alone.

1:28:43.706 --> 1:28:45.543
Alone?

1:28:45.609 --> 1:28:49.647
Oh, you've always
been alone.

1:28:49.712 --> 1:28:52.883
That's not true.
I have real friends.

1:28:52.950 --> 1:28:54.885
Bill. Eddie. Mike. Stanley.
Richie. Beverly.

1:28:54.952 --> 1:28:56.786
They're my real friends.

1:28:56.854 --> 1:29:00.558
Kiss me as if it
were the last time.

1:29:07.932 --> 1:29:09.766
What the hell
are you doing, kid?

1:29:26.317 --> 1:29:27.851
Guys?

1:29:28.619 --> 1:29:29.819
Hey.

1:29:31.422 --> 1:29:32.789
Hey.

1:29:34.258 --> 1:29:36.560
So, what did you see
out there?

1:29:36.627 --> 1:29:38.728
Something I wish
I hadn't.

1:29:42.366 --> 1:29:43.766
So, what, we just...

1:29:46.670 --> 1:29:50.807
We kill It, and then we just
forget everything again?

1:29:50.874 --> 1:29:53.177
I hope so.
Don't you?

1:29:53.244 --> 1:29:55.479
I don't know.

1:29:55.546 --> 1:29:58.415
I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?

1:29:58.482 --> 1:29:59.782
Mmm.

1:29:59.849 --> 1:30:01.252
Come on.
There must be something from

1:30:01.318 --> 1:30:03.387
the past that you don't
want to forget again.

1:30:05.256 --> 1:30:07.458
I remember
being scared shitless.

1:30:08.425 --> 1:30:10.861
Cold.

1:30:10.928 --> 1:30:13.397
I remember you guys
in your tighty-whities.

1:30:13.464 --> 1:30:16.367
Okay. Please forget
that moment.

1:30:18.002 --> 1:30:20.204
I remember this.

1:30:22.439 --> 1:30:25.209
I remember the boy
who wrote it for me.

1:30:27.645 --> 1:30:29.446
Not him, so much,

1:30:31.715 --> 1:30:33.917
but how he made me feel.

1:30:36.854 --> 1:30:38.922
And a kiss.

1:30:43.694 --> 1:30:47.564
It's still blurry,
but I think the longer we're here,

1:30:47.631 --> 1:30:49.400
the more I can see it.

1:30:49.466 --> 1:30:51.834
The more I can see that moment.

1:30:51.902 --> 1:30:53.337
The more
I can see...

1:30:54.371 --> 1:30:55.372
Bill.

1:30:58.342 --> 1:30:59.476
I think.

1:31:01.779 --> 1:31:04.481
I don't know.
Do you remember...

1:31:06.317 --> 1:31:08.485
Bev, um...

1:31:09.987 --> 1:31:11.955
- Move. Move.
- What's wrong?

1:31:12.022 --> 1:31:14.091
I'm leaving.

1:31:14.158 --> 1:31:15.693
What?
You can't leave, man.

1:31:15.759 --> 1:31:17.328
We split,
we all die.

1:31:17.394 --> 1:31:19.430
Yeah, I'll take my chances.
We're gonna die, anyway.

1:31:20.064 --> 1:31:22.299
Rich. Um...

1:31:24.401 --> 1:31:25.969
Rich.

1:31:27.471 --> 1:31:30.107
Hey, kids!
It's Burrow the Beaver!

1:31:30.174 --> 1:31:32.376
Come on down.
It's the last day

1:31:32.443 --> 1:31:34.812
of the festival here
at Canal Days.

1:31:36.613 --> 1:31:37.614
Ahh!

1:31:38.282 --> 1:31:39.383
Asshole!

1:31:53.063 --> 1:31:54.531
Hello?

1:32:06.710 --> 1:32:08.011
Can I help you?

1:32:08.078 --> 1:32:09.513
Yeah, I called in...

1:32:09.580 --> 1:32:11.248
I had prescription
called in for Kaspbrak.

1:32:11.715 --> 1:32:12.916
Kaspbrak?

1:32:12.983 --> 1:32:14.184
It's an inhaler.

1:32:15.719 --> 1:32:18.822
Uh... Eddie Kaspbrak?

1:32:18.889 --> 1:32:20.457
Mmm-hmm.
That's me.

1:32:21.759 --> 1:32:22.960
I remember you.

1:32:23.394 --> 1:32:24.561
Yeah.

1:32:24.628 --> 1:32:26.196
- Mmm-hmm.
- How's your mom?

1:32:26.263 --> 1:32:28.031
Oh, uh...
Well, she died a few years ago.

1:32:28.098 --> 1:32:29.466
It's very sad.
It was from liver cancer.

1:32:29.533 --> 1:32:30.734
What's that?

1:32:30.801 --> 1:32:32.903
- What's what?
- That.

1:32:34.171 --> 1:32:35.939
- All right.
- Uh-huh.

1:32:36.006 --> 1:32:37.241
Okay.

1:32:37.307 --> 1:32:39.576
No, it's not gonna pop.
It's a mole.

1:32:39.643 --> 1:32:41.779
It might not be cancer.

1:32:41.845 --> 1:32:43.046
Cancer?

1:32:45.416 --> 1:32:46.950
But it might be.

1:32:47.017 --> 1:32:48.819
You just stay here.

1:32:48.887 --> 1:32:50.855
I'll get you something.

1:32:52.656 --> 1:32:53.957
Okay.

1:33:03.333 --> 1:33:05.602
You came here for your
stinky breath pills?

1:33:07.104 --> 1:33:09.306
My breath
is fine.

1:33:09.373 --> 1:33:11.141
Thank you.

1:33:11.208 --> 1:33:13.878
That's not
what my dad said.

1:33:13.944 --> 1:33:15.946
He said you have a tumor.

1:33:18.582 --> 1:33:19.884
On your dick.

1:33:21.118 --> 1:33:23.420
But you don't
take pills for...

1:33:25.389 --> 1:33:26.690
Wait, what did
your dad say?

1:33:27.691 --> 1:33:28.959
There you go.

1:33:30.260 --> 1:33:31.495
I hope your dick
feels better.

1:33:33.730 --> 1:33:35.098
Thank you.

1:33:36.467 --> 1:33:39.736
For the inhaler,
not for the penis thing.

1:33:39.803 --> 1:33:42.005
Eddie!

1:33:45.008 --> 1:33:47.110
Eddie bear!

1:33:50.347 --> 1:33:51.648
Mommy?

1:33:57.856 --> 1:33:59.423
Eddie bear!

1:34:02.927 --> 1:34:04.294
Mommy?

1:34:07.197 --> 1:34:09.500
Eddie, come help me!
Quick!

1:34:26.416 --> 1:34:27.952
Eddie!

1:34:28.018 --> 1:34:29.453
Mommy?

1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:30.687
Eddie?

1:34:30.754 --> 1:34:32.155
Eddie, help me!

1:34:32.222 --> 1:34:33.690
Quick, help me!

1:34:33.757 --> 1:34:36.026
Mommy?

1:34:36.093 --> 1:34:38.161
Eddie bear,
come help me, quick!

1:34:54.979 --> 1:34:57.114
Eddie?

1:34:57.180 --> 1:34:58.849
The fuck
is she doing here?

1:34:58.917 --> 1:35:00.250
What is taking you
so long?

1:35:00.317 --> 1:35:02.386
I don't know.
Why are you here?

1:35:11.795 --> 1:35:13.363
Mommy!

1:35:13.430 --> 1:35:15.132
He's coming!
You gotta get me outta here!

1:35:15.198 --> 1:35:16.833
- Who's coming?
- Eddie.

1:35:18.502 --> 1:35:20.470
What the fuck is that?

1:35:27.411 --> 1:35:29.446
- Mommy.
- You gotta get me outta here.

1:35:29.513 --> 1:35:30.982
He's coming!

1:35:31.049 --> 1:35:33.083
He's gonna kill me!
Eddie!

1:35:33.150 --> 1:35:36.587
Help! Please, help me!
He's going to infect me!

1:35:36.653 --> 1:35:39.256
Eddie! He's gonna infect me!
Eddie!

1:35:39.323 --> 1:35:41.291
Help me!

1:35:42.659 --> 1:35:44.862
Help me, Eddie!
He's coming, Eddie!

1:35:44.929 --> 1:35:47.497
Eddie, hurry!

1:35:47.564 --> 1:35:49.700
He's gonna infect me, Eddie!

1:35:52.402 --> 1:35:53.604
Oh, my God!
Eddie!

1:35:54.805 --> 1:35:55.839
Hurry up, Eddie!

1:36:01.913 --> 1:36:03.213
Eddie!

1:36:11.121 --> 1:36:12.823
- I can't do it!
- Eddie! Eddie!

1:36:12.890 --> 1:36:15.525
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

1:36:15.592 --> 1:36:18.428
I knew you would leave me, Eddie!

1:36:20.664 --> 1:36:22.165
Eddie, help me!

1:36:27.804 --> 1:36:28.940
Eddie!

1:36:33.810 --> 1:36:36.246
What's all this shit
doing here?

1:36:36.313 --> 1:36:38.248
Why is that curtain
still here?

1:36:38.849 --> 1:36:39.951
Okay, all right.

1:36:40.018 --> 1:36:42.252
Are you gonna
do this, Eds?

1:36:42.319 --> 1:36:43.520
It's just a memory.

1:36:43.587 --> 1:36:45.023
It's just a memory.
You're fine.

1:36:45.089 --> 1:36:47.424
Deep breath.
Deep breath.

1:36:48.225 --> 1:36:50.494
Okay.
You gonna do it?

1:37:00.038 --> 1:37:02.006
Shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!

1:37:08.178 --> 1:37:09.713
Stop! Stop!

1:37:30.267 --> 1:37:31.568
That's right!

1:37:32.636 --> 1:37:34.538
Fuck you!

1:37:34.604 --> 1:37:36.673
Fuck you!

1:37:50.021 --> 1:37:51.455
What the fuck?

1:37:56.094 --> 1:37:57.627
What?

1:37:57.694 --> 1:37:59.396
Push, don't pull,
you moron.

1:37:59.463 --> 1:38:01.665
Oh. Thanks.

1:38:15.846 --> 1:38:18.248
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

1:38:18.315 --> 1:38:19.549
Nothing. I'm fine.

1:38:19.616 --> 1:38:21.618
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

1:38:23.054 --> 1:38:24.521
Hey, how you doing?
Where's everybody else?

1:38:24.588 --> 1:38:25.890
Richie wants to leave.

1:38:25.957 --> 1:38:27.357
Ben's upstairs
trying to get him to stay.

1:38:27.424 --> 1:38:29.359
Eddie's just scared.

1:38:29.426 --> 1:38:30.694
So am I, Bill.

1:38:30.761 --> 1:38:32.230
Aren't you?

1:38:32.295 --> 1:38:33.865
We're all scared.

1:38:33.931 --> 1:38:35.066
That's what worries me.

1:38:35.133 --> 1:38:36.466
Because that's
what It wants.

1:38:36.533 --> 1:38:37.834
We can do this,

1:38:37.902 --> 1:38:39.336
but we have
to stick together.

1:39:37.561 --> 1:39:38.996
Should we be running?

1:39:39.063 --> 1:39:40.898
This is Derry.
I'm kinda getting used to it.

1:40:10.127 --> 1:40:11.128
What does that mean?

1:40:12.696 --> 1:40:14.364
Shit. It's the kid.

1:40:15.032 --> 1:40:16.533
What?

1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:18.870
It's the kid
from the place.

1:40:18.936 --> 1:40:20.004
The Chinese place.

1:40:20.071 --> 1:40:21.138
I saw him
on the way here.

1:40:21.205 --> 1:40:23.040
He lives
at my old house.

1:40:23.107 --> 1:40:25.042
He was going to the fair, and...

1:40:28.511 --> 1:40:30.047
He's going to the fair.
I gotta help him.

1:40:30.114 --> 1:40:32.016
Okay, okay. Listen to me.
We'll go together.

1:40:32.083 --> 1:40:33.885
I'm gonna get Richie
and Ben and we'll go.

1:40:33.951 --> 1:40:36.486
There's no time.
I can't let it happen again.

1:40:36.553 --> 1:40:38.055
What happened before
wasn't your fault.

1:40:38.122 --> 1:40:39.190
None of it was.

1:40:39.257 --> 1:40:40.858
I wish
that were true, Bev.

1:40:43.460 --> 1:40:45.863
Bill! Bev!

1:40:45.930 --> 1:40:48.132
- What is this? What happened?
- Uh...

1:40:48.199 --> 1:40:49.367
Did Bill just leave?

1:40:49.432 --> 1:40:50.500
I couldn't stop him.

1:40:50.567 --> 1:40:51.869
Everybody's leaving.

1:40:51.936 --> 1:40:53.436
It's all right. It's Bill.
He'll be back.

1:40:53.503 --> 1:40:55.373
He'll come back.

1:40:55.438 --> 1:40:57.641
Well, at least
I got Richie to stay.

1:41:00.211 --> 1:41:01.544
Fuck. Oh.

1:41:18.396 --> 1:41:20.197
Oh. And then the leper,
he threw up all over me.

1:41:20.264 --> 1:41:21.464
"Hey, it's Mike Hanlon.

1:41:21.531 --> 1:41:22.599
"Why don't you
come back to Maine?"

1:41:25.769 --> 1:41:27.537
It's your time, Eddie.

1:41:29.140 --> 1:41:30.274
What?

1:41:32.910 --> 1:41:34.211
Why?

1:41:34.278 --> 1:41:35.947
Why did you do that?

1:41:36.013 --> 1:41:38.682
Because he says
it's your time.

1:41:38.748 --> 1:41:40.684
Who says it's my time?

1:41:42.386 --> 1:41:44.288
You know, Eddie.

1:41:44.355 --> 1:41:46.390
You know.

1:41:46.456 --> 1:41:48.392
Time to float.

1:41:54.531 --> 1:41:56.133
Where did he go?

1:41:58.970 --> 1:42:01.906
Now give me back
my fucking knife!

1:42:19.190 --> 1:42:20.458
You should cut
that fucking mullet.

1:42:20.523 --> 1:42:22.460
It's been, like,
30 years, man.

1:42:22.525 --> 1:42:24.061
Guys!

1:42:25.896 --> 1:42:26.998
Oh, shit.

1:42:28.832 --> 1:42:29.833
Eds?

1:42:31.768 --> 1:42:34.105
Jesus, Eds.
What the hell?

1:42:34.171 --> 1:42:35.772
- Bowers is in my room.
- Oh, my...

1:42:38.175 --> 1:42:39.910
- Is it bad?
- No.

1:42:54.624 --> 1:42:56.227
<i>I'm gonna
carve my whole name</i>

1:42:56.293 --> 1:42:57.594
<i>onto this cottage cheese!</i>

1:43:04.734 --> 1:43:06.170
One down!

1:43:07.405 --> 1:43:08.906
Fuck yeah!

1:43:36.300 --> 1:43:37.535
Hey!

1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:39.602
Hey, kid! Kid!

1:43:40.905 --> 1:43:43.040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1:43:43.107 --> 1:43:44.108
Hey!

1:43:44.175 --> 1:43:46.544
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! Hey!

1:43:46.609 --> 1:43:48.179
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:43:51.048 --> 1:43:52.116
Fuck.

1:44:02.393 --> 1:44:03.827
Fuck!

1:44:20.945 --> 1:44:22.679
Kid! Hey, kid!

1:44:23.547 --> 1:44:24.848
Fuck.

1:44:25.249 --> 1:44:26.250
Kid?

1:44:30.588 --> 1:44:31.788
Fuck.

1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:44.401
Kid?

1:44:45.002 --> 1:44:46.036
Hey!

1:44:54.612 --> 1:44:55.845
Kid.

1:45:02.153 --> 1:45:04.155
Kid? Hey! Hey!

1:45:04.221 --> 1:45:05.523
Kid!

1:45:05.589 --> 1:45:07.424
Fuck.

1:45:08.225 --> 1:45:09.293
Shit.

1:45:10.094 --> 1:45:11.562
Hey.

1:45:11.629 --> 1:45:12.695
What are you
doing here?

1:45:12.762 --> 1:45:14.565
Hey.

1:45:14.632 --> 1:45:17.168
No, I'm here to
help.

1:45:17.234 --> 1:45:18.801
Stop following me!

1:45:18.869 --> 1:45:21.205
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

1:45:27.645 --> 1:45:28.845
No.

1:45:31.115 --> 1:45:32.183
Please.

1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:38.088
Ah.

1:45:38.155 --> 1:45:40.224
I'm here this time.
Just take me.

1:45:46.230 --> 1:45:47.231
Son of a bitch!

1:45:58.642 --> 1:45:59.742
Help!

1:46:03.780 --> 1:46:05.216
Help!

1:46:06.317 --> 1:46:07.351
Help!

1:46:33.611 --> 1:46:35.312
I should go back there.
I just fucking

1:46:35.379 --> 1:46:37.214
left them in the lurch, man.
I should go back there.

1:46:37.281 --> 1:46:39.250
What the fuck are you talking about?
Fuck that.

1:46:39.316 --> 1:46:40.384
Fuck them.

1:46:41.784 --> 1:46:44.388
I got dates
in fucking Reno, man.

1:46:53.731 --> 1:46:55.466
<i>Reflecting
on the meaning of</i>

1:46:55.532 --> 1:46:56.833
<i>what I just read,</i>

1:46:56.900 --> 1:46:59.270
the word <i>"Leshanot"</i>
comes up a lot,

1:46:59.336 --> 1:47:02.273
which means "to
change, to transform."

1:47:03.173 --> 1:47:05.242
Which makes sense,
I guess,

1:47:05.309 --> 1:47:08.078
because today I'm
supposed to become a man.

1:47:11.181 --> 1:47:13.517
<i>It's funny, though.</i>

1:47:13.584 --> 1:47:16.920
<i>Everyone, I think,
has some memories</i>

1:47:16.987 --> 1:47:18.856
<i>they're prouder of
than others, right?</i>

1:47:20.624 --> 1:47:24.061
<i>And maybe that's why
change is so scary.</i>

1:47:25.996 --> 1:47:28.499
<i>'Cause the things we wish
we could leave behind...</i>

1:47:29.967 --> 1:47:32.369
- Good morning, Mike.
- How you doing?

1:47:32.436 --> 1:47:34.338
<i>...the whispers we wish
we could silence...</i>

1:47:34.405 --> 1:47:37.875
His pa is the one.
The one that set that fire.

1:47:39.943 --> 1:47:43.213
<i>...the nightmares we most
want to wake up from,</i>

1:47:45.649 --> 1:47:48.552
<i>the memories we wish
we could change...</i>

1:47:53.123 --> 1:47:56.093
<i>...the secrets we feel
like we have to keep</i>

1:47:58.162 --> 1:48:00.931
<i>are the hardest to
walk away from.</i>

1:48:04.802 --> 1:48:07.338
<i>The good stuff?</i>

1:48:07.404 --> 1:48:11.608
<i>The pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest?</i>

1:48:11.675 --> 1:48:15.279
<i>Those pieces of you it
feels the easiest to lose.</i>

1:48:16.980 --> 1:48:20.017
<i>Maybe I don't want to forget.</i>

1:48:22.052 --> 1:48:25.356
Maybe if that's what
today is all about,

1:48:27.624 --> 1:48:29.526
forget it, right?

1:48:29.593 --> 1:48:31.228
Thank you, Stanley.

1:48:31.295 --> 1:48:32.963
Today, I'm supposed
to become a man,

1:48:33.030 --> 1:48:36.033
but I don't feel
any different.

1:48:38.001 --> 1:48:40.104
I know I'm a loser.

1:48:40.170 --> 1:48:42.373
And no matter what,

1:48:42.439 --> 1:48:44.375
I always fucking will be.

1:49:04.762 --> 1:49:06.630
Thanks for showing up,
Stanley.

1:49:48.172 --> 1:49:50.541
<i>Mike! Help!</i>

1:49:52.342 --> 1:49:53.510
Help us!

1:49:53.577 --> 1:49:56.780
- Please, Mikey, get help!
- Help us!

1:49:56.847 --> 1:49:59.918
Please, Mikey,
get help!

1:49:59.983 --> 1:50:01.285
Mikey!

1:50:26.610 --> 1:50:29.413
You should
have burned, Mike.

1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:37.488
Just like
your druggie parents.

1:50:37.554 --> 1:50:40.290
Can you see them yet?

1:50:40.357 --> 1:50:41.692
Crisping?

1:50:43.260 --> 1:50:45.429
Like fried fucking...

1:50:57.441 --> 1:51:00.110
I guess you could say
that was long overdue.

1:51:00.177 --> 1:51:02.012
Get it?
'Cause we're in a library.

1:51:02.079 --> 1:51:03.647
No.

1:51:04.916 --> 1:51:06.116
Oh...

1:51:08.619 --> 1:51:09.854
Mike?

1:51:09.921 --> 1:51:12.122
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, my God.

1:51:18.161 --> 1:51:19.763
Are you all right?

1:51:19.830 --> 1:51:21.532
No, I'm not all right.
I just fucking killed a guy.

1:51:22.699 --> 1:51:24.201
I was talking to Mike.

1:51:26.270 --> 1:51:27.771
Where's Bill?

1:51:33.443 --> 1:51:34.778
Bill, we're all
at the library.

1:51:34.845 --> 1:51:36.280
Where are you at?

1:51:36.346 --> 1:51:38.582
He took a little
kid, Mike.

1:51:38.649 --> 1:51:42.219
He took a little kid right
in fucking front of me.

1:51:42.286 --> 1:51:44.054
No, no, no, no, no.
Just, just...

1:51:44.121 --> 1:51:45.489
Look, just come here
to the library.

1:51:45.556 --> 1:51:47.057
We can talk about
the plan.

1:51:47.124 --> 1:51:49.226
- I'm gonna go kill It.
- <i>No, no, no.</i>

1:51:49.293 --> 1:51:53.096
I don't want any of you
to get killed with me.

1:51:53.163 --> 1:51:54.531
<i>Bill! Bill!</i>

1:51:59.303 --> 1:52:00.939
He's going
to fight It alone.

1:52:01.005 --> 1:52:03.373
- What?
- Alone.

1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:04.708
It's about the group.

1:52:04.775 --> 1:52:06.209
The ritual doesn't work
without the group.

1:52:06.276 --> 1:52:07.844
Doing it together
is why it'd work.

1:52:11.782 --> 1:52:14.217
Mike, did he tell you
where he was going?

1:52:14.284 --> 1:52:16.119
If he really wanted
to kill Pennywise,

1:52:16.186 --> 1:52:17.721
there's only one place
he'll go.

1:52:17.788 --> 1:52:19.656
The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.

1:52:19.723 --> 1:52:22.159
Oh, we're not gonna like
this, are we?

1:52:23.126 --> 1:52:24.595
Fuck.

1:52:54.058 --> 1:52:55.927
Bill!

1:52:55.994 --> 1:52:58.029
No, no,
you guys, no!

1:52:58.096 --> 1:53:00.098
I started all this.

1:53:00.163 --> 1:53:02.934
It's my fault that
you're all here.

1:53:03.001 --> 1:53:06.436
This curse, this fucking
thing that's inside you all.

1:53:06.503 --> 1:53:08.472
It started growing
the day

1:53:08.538 --> 1:53:10.074
that I made you go
down to the Barrens

1:53:10.140 --> 1:53:14.778
because all I cared about
was finding Georgie.

1:53:16.213 --> 1:53:17.681
Now, I'm gonna
go in there,

1:53:17.748 --> 1:53:19.416
and I don't know
what's gonna happen,

1:53:19.483 --> 1:53:22.285
but I can't ask you
to do this.

1:53:24.354 --> 1:53:25.689
Well,

1:53:25.756 --> 1:53:27.925
we're not asking you,
either.

1:53:27.992 --> 1:53:29.027
- Bev...
- We didn't

1:53:29.093 --> 1:53:30.627
do it alone
then, Bill,

1:53:30.694 --> 1:53:33.330
so we're not gonna
do this alone now.

1:53:33.397 --> 1:53:35.632
Losers stick together.

1:53:41.204 --> 1:53:43.875
So, does somebody
want to say something?

1:53:45.709 --> 1:53:48.845
Richie said it best
when we were here last.

1:53:48.913 --> 1:53:50.280
I did?

1:53:51.848 --> 1:53:54.651
- "I don't want to die"?
- Not that.

1:53:54.718 --> 1:53:56.486
"You're lucky we're
not measuring dicks"?

1:53:57.955 --> 1:53:59.456
No.

1:54:01.491 --> 1:54:02.927
"Let's kill
this fucking clown"?

1:54:06.864 --> 1:54:09.533
Let's kill this
fucking clown.

1:54:34.357 --> 1:54:35.826
Hmm.

1:54:35.893 --> 1:54:37.494
Well, I love what he's
done with the place.

1:54:38.228 --> 1:54:39.362
Beep-beep, Richie.

1:54:39.429 --> 1:54:40.697
All right.

1:54:59.716 --> 1:55:01.818
Hey, hey.
That's the basement, right?

1:55:07.791 --> 1:55:09.526
Ben?

1:55:09.593 --> 1:55:11.828
No, no!
Hey, hey! Ben!

1:55:11.896 --> 1:55:12.997
Ben!

1:55:13.064 --> 1:55:14.065
Ben? What's wrong?

1:55:16.399 --> 1:55:18.602
- Ben!
- Okay. All right.

1:55:18.668 --> 1:55:20.303
Ben!

1:55:26.443 --> 1:55:28.445
Okay, that can't
be good, right?

1:55:29.881 --> 1:55:31.615
Help! Hey!

1:55:38.256 --> 1:55:39.456
Ugh!

1:55:46.130 --> 1:55:47.330
It's Stan.

1:55:51.102 --> 1:55:52.302
It can't
be real.

1:55:53.938 --> 1:55:55.973
Oh!

1:55:57.507 --> 1:55:58.943
Oh, God.

1:55:59.010 --> 1:56:00.077
Shit.

1:56:08.318 --> 1:56:10.754
I'd still be alive if
it wasn't for you, Bill.

1:56:11.889 --> 1:56:12.890
No.

1:56:17.295 --> 1:56:18.628
Beverly!

1:56:40.550 --> 1:56:42.752
Richie, what's happening to me?

1:57:02.572 --> 1:57:05.142
You gotta be
fucking kidding.

1:57:10.447 --> 1:57:12.749
Fuck!

1:57:14.185 --> 1:57:17.554
Oh, God damn it, get it away from me.
Oh, God!

1:57:20.523 --> 1:57:22.559
Whoa, whoa!

1:57:33.237 --> 1:57:34.372
Eddie.

1:57:34.437 --> 1:57:36.573
Hey. Are you okay?

1:57:37.074 --> 1:57:38.075
I'm...

1:57:43.281 --> 1:57:44.514
Oh, there he is.

1:57:48.252 --> 1:57:49.452
Get it off of me!

1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:52.123
Get it off of me!

1:57:54.091 --> 1:57:55.026
Richie!

1:57:55.092 --> 1:57:57.395
- Richie!
- Richie! Hey!

1:58:00.064 --> 1:58:01.731
- Get it off of me!
- I wanna go home.

1:58:03.301 --> 1:58:04.801
Get the knife!

1:58:04.869 --> 1:58:06.636
God damn it, Eddie,
get the knife!

1:58:06.703 --> 1:58:09.206
Bill! Get it off of me, Bill!
Quick!

1:58:11.708 --> 1:58:13.476
Eddie, get the knife!

1:58:14.111 --> 1:58:15.679
Ahh! Fuck!

1:58:36.367 --> 1:58:37.368
What?

1:58:49.246 --> 1:58:51.048
Is everybody okay?

1:58:51.115 --> 1:58:53.918
You all right?

1:58:53.985 --> 1:58:56.287
He could have
fucking died, man.

1:58:56.354 --> 1:58:57.487
You know that, right?

1:58:57.554 --> 1:58:59.123
I can't see.

1:58:59.190 --> 1:59:02.826
Georgie's dead. The kid's dead.
Stanley's dead.

1:59:02.893 --> 1:59:05.429
You want Richie, too?
You want Richie, too?

1:59:05.495 --> 1:59:07.764
I don't want Richie, too.
I don't. I don't.

1:59:12.502 --> 1:59:14.504
Please don't
be mad, Bill.

1:59:18.409 --> 1:59:20.277
I was just scared.

1:59:22.779 --> 1:59:25.715
That's what
he wants, right?

1:59:28.185 --> 1:59:30.121
Don't give it to him.

1:59:42.665 --> 1:59:44.268
A lot of memories, huh?

1:59:46.536 --> 1:59:47.837
All bad.

2:00:00.550 --> 2:00:01.785
Oh, man.

2:00:03.287 --> 2:00:05.256
Blech. Gray water.

2:00:43.561 --> 2:00:44.995
Shit. This is it.

2:00:46.964 --> 2:00:48.199
This is where
it happened.

2:01:04.081 --> 2:01:05.648
No, no, no.

2:01:05.715 --> 2:01:07.284
No. Ugh!

2:01:15.860 --> 2:01:17.161
Bevvie.

2:01:26.570 --> 2:01:27.770
Bev, what is it?

2:01:33.010 --> 2:01:34.612
I thought
I heard something.

2:01:37.148 --> 2:01:38.516
Bev!

2:01:38.582 --> 2:01:39.950
Time to sink!

2:01:43.653 --> 2:01:45.055
Bev!

2:01:46.957 --> 2:01:48.192
Guys.

2:01:51.395 --> 2:01:53.063
Okay, guys.
Come on.

2:01:57.535 --> 2:01:59.303
Hey, guys.

2:01:59.370 --> 2:02:01.472
Guys, come on.
Please, come on.

2:02:01.539 --> 2:02:03.340
I don't want to walk
out of here alone.

2:02:07.178 --> 2:02:08.913
You okay?

2:02:08.979 --> 2:02:11.182
I feel like crying.

2:02:11.248 --> 2:02:14.051
Mike. Where do we go from here?

2:02:21.091 --> 2:02:22.825
In the depths
is where It crept.

2:02:22.893 --> 2:02:24.694
In the beneath,
to find belief.

2:02:24.761 --> 2:02:26.063
In the depths
is where It crept.

2:02:26.130 --> 2:02:27.598
In the beneath,
to find belief.

2:02:27.665 --> 2:02:29.133
Is he okay?

2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:31.068
I think at this point,
that's a relative question.

2:02:31.135 --> 2:02:32.903
What's on
the other side?

2:02:32.970 --> 2:02:35.339
I don't know.
No one does.

2:02:38.175 --> 2:02:39.376
Whoa,
whoa, whoa!

2:02:40.211 --> 2:02:41.212
Mike.

2:02:46.317 --> 2:02:48.352
- Mike, don't.
- All right.

2:02:48.419 --> 2:02:49.719
- See you down there.
- Mike!

2:02:49.786 --> 2:02:51.021
Wait!

2:02:57.194 --> 2:02:59.463
- Stay together.
- Okay.

2:03:02.566 --> 2:03:03.800
You guys,
I can't do it.

2:03:05.903 --> 2:03:08.038
I can't.
You saw what happened up there.

2:03:08.105 --> 2:03:10.174
I was gonna
let you die.

2:03:10.241 --> 2:03:12.142
I just fucking
froze up.

2:03:12.209 --> 2:03:14.245
If you let me go
down there with you,

2:03:14.311 --> 2:03:15.845
I'm gonna get us all killed.

2:03:15.913 --> 2:03:17.014
Hey, hey, hey.
Give me that.

2:03:17.081 --> 2:03:18.082
- Give me that.
- Richie.

2:03:18.148 --> 2:03:19.782
Let go,
you little turd.

2:03:19.849 --> 2:03:21.619
Just let me get...

2:03:23.020 --> 2:03:24.221
- I got it.
- Stop.

2:03:24.955 --> 2:03:26.490
Listen to me.

2:03:26.557 --> 2:03:28.125
You had a moment.
Fine.

2:03:28.192 --> 2:03:30.995
But who killed a psychotic
clown before he was 14?

2:03:32.529 --> 2:03:33.664
Me.

2:03:33.731 --> 2:03:34.797
Who stabbed Bowers
with a knife

2:03:34.865 --> 2:03:36.133
he pulled out
of his own face?

2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:37.468
Also me.

2:03:37.534 --> 2:03:39.236
Who married a woman 10
times his own body mass?

2:03:41.804 --> 2:03:43.407
- Me.
- Yeah.

2:03:46.443 --> 2:03:48.845
You're braver
than you think.

2:03:48.912 --> 2:03:50.114
All right.
Thanks, Rich.

2:03:51.048 --> 2:03:53.083
- Ow.
- Sorry.

2:03:55.586 --> 2:03:56.720
Hey.
Here.

2:03:56.786 --> 2:03:57.855
Take it.

2:03:57.921 --> 2:03:59.822
It kills monsters.

2:04:01.824 --> 2:04:04.061
- Does it?
- Yeah.

2:04:04.128 --> 2:04:05.795
If you believe
it does.

2:04:07.364 --> 2:04:08.432
Thanks, Bev.

2:04:26.650 --> 2:04:27.785
You guys good?

2:04:27.851 --> 2:04:29.119
Yeah.

2:04:33.657 --> 2:04:34.758
Can you get through that?

2:04:34.824 --> 2:04:35.893
It's the only way.
This way.

2:04:35.959 --> 2:04:37.494
It's in here!

2:04:41.432 --> 2:04:42.566
Through here.

2:04:42.633 --> 2:04:44.535
It's tight,
but we can get through.

2:05:00.084 --> 2:05:01.952
This is where It hid.

2:05:22.539 --> 2:05:26.877
So, all this has been under
Derry, like, forever?

2:05:26.944 --> 2:05:28.779
Not forever.

2:05:28.846 --> 2:05:30.280
Just a few million years.

2:06:06.216 --> 2:06:09.319
It can only be
attacked in its true form.

2:06:09.386 --> 2:06:10.487
The ritual
will show us that.

2:06:10.554 --> 2:06:12.156
And what is
It's true form?

2:06:12.222 --> 2:06:14.057
I hope it's a puppy.

2:06:14.124 --> 2:06:16.427
Like a Pomeranian or...

2:06:16.493 --> 2:06:17.494
I'll shut up.

2:06:18.495 --> 2:06:19.530
It's light.

2:06:23.367 --> 2:06:25.436
A light that must be
snuffed out by darkness.

2:06:38.615 --> 2:06:39.616
Your artifacts.

2:06:41.218 --> 2:06:43.387
Place them in the fire.

2:06:43.454 --> 2:06:45.522
The past must
burn with the present.

2:06:53.964 --> 2:06:57.234
This is the boat
that I built

2:06:59.670 --> 2:07:01.171
with Georgie.

2:07:05.776 --> 2:07:08.045
It's my inhaler.

2:07:13.283 --> 2:07:14.451
Come on, dude.

2:07:17.054 --> 2:07:19.289
Something that
I wish I had held on to.

2:07:24.963 --> 2:07:27.866
This is a page
from my yearbook.

2:07:27.932 --> 2:07:30.534
That only
one person signed.

2:07:30.601 --> 2:07:33.938
I probably should
have forgotten it,

2:07:34.004 --> 2:07:36.473
but I couldn't,
because I kept it in my wallet

2:07:38.275 --> 2:07:39.776
for 27 years.

2:07:46.083 --> 2:07:47.651
This is a token
from the Capitol Theater.

2:07:47.718 --> 2:07:49.353
- You brought an actual token?
- Yeah, man.

2:07:49.419 --> 2:07:51.054
That's what we were supposed to
do, asshole.

2:07:51.121 --> 2:07:52.723
Do you have any idea how long
that's gonna take to burn?

2:07:52.789 --> 2:07:54.224
Yeah, but so is your
inhaler, dude.

2:07:54.291 --> 2:07:55.927
Guys, come on.

2:07:55.994 --> 2:07:57.794
All the toxic fumes and
the plastic and shit, so...

2:08:00.731 --> 2:08:01.732
Look closely, Bev.

2:08:03.200 --> 2:08:05.102
You see it?

2:08:05.168 --> 2:08:06.603
That's where
you hit Bowers.

2:08:08.605 --> 2:08:09.606
The rock fight.

2:08:12.109 --> 2:08:14.044
The day these bonds were forged.

2:08:15.013 --> 2:08:16.513
That's not
gonna burn, either.

2:08:22.052 --> 2:08:23.253
Oh, wait.

2:08:26.657 --> 2:08:28.158
Couldn't forget
about Stan,

2:08:28.893 --> 2:08:30.160
again.

2:08:35.132 --> 2:08:36.767
Okay.

2:08:36.833 --> 2:08:37.834
Grab hands.

2:08:39.536 --> 2:08:40.571
Come on.

2:08:48.178 --> 2:08:50.280
The Ritual of Chud.

2:08:50.347 --> 2:08:53.150
It's a battle of wills.

2:08:53.216 --> 2:08:55.686
The first step
was our reunion.

2:08:55.752 --> 2:08:59.556
The second was
the gathering of tokens.

2:09:01.425 --> 2:09:03.460
This is the final step.

2:09:06.296 --> 2:09:07.497
What the...

2:09:16.239 --> 2:09:17.875
Fuck is that?

2:09:17.942 --> 2:09:19.309
- Don't look at them!
- Are those

2:09:19.376 --> 2:09:21.012
- the Deadlights?
- Don't look at it!

2:09:21.079 --> 2:09:22.713
Okay.

2:09:22.779 --> 2:09:24.414
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark. Say it!

2:09:24.481 --> 2:09:26.084
- Say what?
- Say it!

2:09:26.183 --> 2:09:27.618
Turn light
into dark.

2:09:29.586 --> 2:09:31.221
Turn light into dark.

2:09:31.288 --> 2:09:32.789
Turn light
into dark.

2:09:32.857 --> 2:09:34.491
Turn light
into dark.

2:09:36.094 --> 2:09:38.362
Turn light into dark.

2:09:50.942 --> 2:09:53.310
Turn light into dark.
Mike, what's happening, man?

2:09:53.377 --> 2:09:55.013
Keep chanting!

2:09:55.079 --> 2:09:56.279
Turn light
into dark.

2:09:59.449 --> 2:10:01.919
Turn light
into dark!

2:10:01.986 --> 2:10:03.855
Turn light
into dark!

2:10:03.921 --> 2:10:06.657
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

2:10:06.723 --> 2:10:08.358
- Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

2:10:08.425 --> 2:10:10.061
- Keep chanting!
- Turn light into dark!

2:10:14.032 --> 2:10:15.967
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

2:10:16.034 --> 2:10:17.068
Is it working?
Did we do it?

2:10:20.804 --> 2:10:22.239
What is this?
Is this part of it?

2:10:22.305 --> 2:10:23.774
Mike, is this supposed
to be happening?

2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:25.076
- What? No, no, no.
- Keep chanting!

2:10:25.143 --> 2:10:26.610
- What?
- Keep chanting!

2:10:26.677 --> 2:10:27.979
Turn light
into dark!

2:10:28.046 --> 2:10:29.513
- Turn light into dark.
- Come on!

2:10:29.579 --> 2:10:32.182
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark.

2:10:32.249 --> 2:10:33.550
Whoa!

2:10:38.022 --> 2:10:39.322
Hey! Hey!

2:10:43.794 --> 2:10:44.929
Shit!

2:10:47.631 --> 2:10:50.667
Move, move!
Whoa!

2:10:58.842 --> 2:11:00.777
Bev. Bev.

2:11:01.913 --> 2:11:04.448
- Richie.
- Are you okay?

2:11:04.514 --> 2:11:05.983
- I can't hear shit.
- He's okay.

2:11:06.050 --> 2:11:07.584
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. No, no, no.

2:11:07.651 --> 2:11:09.187
- Wait, where's Mike?
- Mike!

2:11:09.252 --> 2:11:10.454
Mike!

2:11:10.520 --> 2:11:12.522
- I'm here!
- Hey, guys.

2:11:12.589 --> 2:11:14.591
Did we do it? Did we do it?
Yeah? Did we do it?

2:11:14.658 --> 2:11:16.226
We put the
tokens in the thing.

2:11:16.293 --> 2:11:17.360
That's good, right?

2:11:17.427 --> 2:11:19.197
We did it, right?

2:11:21.199 --> 2:11:22.632
Shit! Shit!

2:11:22.699 --> 2:11:25.769
Oh, did it work, Mikey?
Did it work?

2:11:27.838 --> 2:11:31.374
Tell them why your silly
little ritual didn't work.

2:11:32.609 --> 2:11:34.377
Tell them
it's all just a...

2:11:34.444 --> 2:11:36.246
What's the word, Eds?

2:11:36.313 --> 2:11:37.581
Gazebo?

2:11:38.849 --> 2:11:40.484
Mike, what's
he talking about?

2:11:40.550 --> 2:11:41.718
Mikey?

2:11:43.253 --> 2:11:48.025
Oh, Mikey, you never showed
them the fourth side, did you?

2:11:49.559 --> 2:11:50.995
Didn't want them to know

2:11:51.062 --> 2:11:53.998
what actually happened to
the poor Shokopiwah?

2:11:54.065 --> 2:11:56.333
<i>Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.</i>

2:12:04.841 --> 2:12:07.111
Fuck, Mikey.
You lied to us, again?

2:12:07.178 --> 2:12:10.313
No,
but they didn't believe!

2:12:10.380 --> 2:12:11.615
They didn't believe
they could kill It!

2:12:11.681 --> 2:12:13.017
That's why it didn't
work back then!

2:12:13.084 --> 2:12:14.351
Are you fucking kidding
me, Mike?

2:12:14.417 --> 2:12:15.953
- We hurt him.
- Fuck!

2:12:16.020 --> 2:12:17.554
Fuck you, Mikey.

2:12:17.621 --> 2:12:20.657
I needed something,
anything, for us to remember.

2:12:20.724 --> 2:12:22.226
Anything for us
to believe!

2:12:22.292 --> 2:12:23.393
- God damn it!
- Fuck!

2:12:32.402 --> 2:12:33.470
The Deadlights!

2:12:33.537 --> 2:12:34.906
Don't look at them!

2:12:39.944 --> 2:12:41.545
For 27 years,

2:12:42.479 --> 2:12:45.950
I dreamt of you.

2:12:47.185 --> 2:12:49.486
I craved you.

2:12:49.553 --> 2:12:52.156
Oh, I've
missed you!

2:12:52.223 --> 2:12:54.158
Mike! Move back!

2:12:54.225 --> 2:12:58.328
Waiting for
this very moment.

2:12:58.395 --> 2:13:00.898
Mikey!
You gotta move, Mikey!

2:13:00.965 --> 2:13:02.699
- Sorry. I'm sorry, guys.
- Mike, come on, man!

2:13:02.766 --> 2:13:04.135
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

2:13:04.202 --> 2:13:06.603
Time to float!

2:13:09.207 --> 2:13:10.740
- Oh, shit!
- Sorry.

2:13:12.910 --> 2:13:14.611
Mike, come on, get up!
Get him up!

2:13:14.678 --> 2:13:16.513
- Go, go!
- Run!

2:13:16.580 --> 2:13:18.916
- Oh, shit!
- Run! Go, go, go!

2:13:29.227 --> 2:13:30.660
Go, go, go!

2:13:34.866 --> 2:13:35.900
Go!

2:13:49.113 --> 2:13:50.614
Go, go, go!

2:13:54.952 --> 2:13:55.953
Where'd he go?

2:13:56.020 --> 2:13:57.154
Don't worry.
We'll find a way out.

2:14:18.842 --> 2:14:20.477
- Oh, shit!
- Can he see us?

2:14:21.511 --> 2:14:22.846
Oh, my God!

2:14:22.914 --> 2:14:23.981
Shit.

2:14:24.781 --> 2:14:26.449
Oh, shit.

2:14:26.516 --> 2:14:28.618
Holy shit!
Holy shit! Run!

2:14:28.685 --> 2:14:30.187
Oh, shit!

2:14:31.856 --> 2:14:33.456
Shit.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2:14:39.629 --> 2:14:40.830
We're trapped.

2:14:40.898 --> 2:14:42.666
Where do we go?

2:15:11.661 --> 2:15:13.663
- God damn it!
- Uh...

2:15:13.730 --> 2:15:15.933
All right.
"Not Scary At All." All right?

2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:16.867
No, no, no.

2:15:16.934 --> 2:15:18.601
Wait. Why?

2:15:18.668 --> 2:15:20.438
They're flipped.
He's fucking with us.

2:15:20.503 --> 2:15:22.672
- Are you sure? Positive?
- Trust me.

2:15:22.739 --> 2:15:24.041
- Yes!
- Okay.

2:15:28.645 --> 2:15:29.880
Where's my shoe?

2:15:42.759 --> 2:15:45.062
What the fuck?
You told me to trust you!

2:15:47.398 --> 2:15:48.565
He's not
fucking with us.

2:15:48.631 --> 2:15:49.766
Let's go to
"Not Scary At All."

2:15:49.833 --> 2:15:51.135
Okay.

2:15:57.041 --> 2:15:59.043
It's all right.
Let's go.

2:16:01.312 --> 2:16:02.947
Oh, shit.

2:16:05.116 --> 2:16:06.917
No way am I falling
for this shit again.

2:16:06.984 --> 2:16:09.420
Oh, yeah.
That thing's a fucking monster.

2:16:09.487 --> 2:16:10.720
Richie, make it sit.

2:16:10.787 --> 2:16:13.290
I know your moves,
you little bitch.

2:16:15.926 --> 2:16:16.927
Rich?

2:16:17.627 --> 2:16:18.963
It's gone, man.

2:16:19.030 --> 2:16:20.431
- Yeah. Wait.
- Oh. Okay.

2:16:20.498 --> 2:16:21.765
Okay.

2:16:23.267 --> 2:16:24.268
Sit.

2:16:25.436 --> 2:16:26.937
He did it.

2:16:27.004 --> 2:16:28.372
Oh, that's cute.

2:16:28.439 --> 2:16:30.174
- That's a good boy.
- That's actually super cute.

2:16:30.241 --> 2:16:31.541
That's a good boy.

2:16:31.608 --> 2:16:32.977
- Are you a good boy?
- Good boy.

2:16:38.015 --> 2:16:39.283
Shit!

2:16:39.350 --> 2:16:41.252
Yo, next time,
we just go with regular "Scary."

2:16:41.318 --> 2:16:42.652
Next time?

2:16:55.166 --> 2:16:58.135
I lost it,
Billy.

2:16:59.904 --> 2:17:02.173
It just floated off.

2:17:04.841 --> 2:17:07.610
I'm not mad at you.

2:17:09.013 --> 2:17:11.748
It's your fault what
happened, isn't it?

2:17:14.085 --> 2:17:18.122
You weren't really that
sick that morning, were you?

2:17:19.490 --> 2:17:20.723
No.

2:17:22.625 --> 2:17:25.628
I just pretended

2:17:25.695 --> 2:17:28.099
because I didn't want to
play with you.

2:17:31.535 --> 2:17:33.370
I just didn't want to.

2:17:34.572 --> 2:17:37.174
You lied and I died.

2:17:37.942 --> 2:17:41.545
You lied and I died.

2:17:41.611 --> 2:17:44.582
You lied and I died!

2:17:44.647 --> 2:17:47.451
You lied and I died!

2:17:47.518 --> 2:17:49.420
You lied and I died!

2:17:49.487 --> 2:17:51.754
It happened because of
me, Georgie. Me.

2:17:51.821 --> 2:17:53.324
No, no, no.
It was...

2:18:01.532 --> 2:18:02.600
Lied and died!

2:18:02.665 --> 2:18:04.568
Lied and died!

2:18:04.634 --> 2:18:06.403
Lied and died!

2:18:06.470 --> 2:18:08.539
You lied and I died!

2:18:40.905 --> 2:18:43.840
You in there, you little shit?
I can smell you.

2:18:43.908 --> 2:18:46.343
You smell
just like Lois Lane.

2:18:47.378 --> 2:18:48.546
Here's Johnny!

2:19:28.751 --> 2:19:30.421
All that success,

2:19:30.487 --> 2:19:31.889
all those sit-ups,

2:19:31.956 --> 2:19:33.790
but deep down,
still just

2:19:33.857 --> 2:19:36.793
a little fat, fat,
fatty loser...

2:19:38.229 --> 2:19:41.831
...who always knew
he would die alone.

2:19:48.472 --> 2:19:50.608
- Slut!
- Bev!

2:19:53.577 --> 2:19:54.811
Beverly!

2:19:55.412 --> 2:19:56.846
Bevvie.

2:19:56.914 --> 2:19:59.717
Just open up the door for
me, okay?

2:19:59.782 --> 2:20:01.719
Beverly,
can you hear me?

2:20:03.454 --> 2:20:05.755
Come to Daddy, now.

2:20:05.822 --> 2:20:07.091
Bev, don't listen!

2:20:08.791 --> 2:20:09.994
Bev!

2:20:11.228 --> 2:20:13.230
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2:20:15.065 --> 2:20:16.900
Beverly, I love you!

2:20:17.868 --> 2:20:19.136
Ben!

2:20:19.203 --> 2:20:21.605
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2:20:21.672 --> 2:20:23.540
Are you still
my little girl?

2:20:23.607 --> 2:20:24.642
Not anymore!

2:20:27.810 --> 2:20:29.846
You little...

2:20:29.913 --> 2:20:31.814
"Your hair
is winter fire.

2:20:33.284 --> 2:20:35.452
"January embers.

2:20:35.519 --> 2:20:37.321
"My heart...

2:20:40.324 --> 2:20:41.358
"My heart..."

2:20:43.394 --> 2:20:44.395
No!

2:20:50.800 --> 2:20:52.069
Ben!

2:20:52.136 --> 2:20:54.505
Ben!

2:21:16.627 --> 2:21:17.928
"January embers."

2:21:19.730 --> 2:21:21.565
"My heart
burns there, too."

2:21:23.434 --> 2:21:24.902
It was you.

2:21:39.849 --> 2:21:41.452
We deserve to die.

2:21:41.518 --> 2:21:42.986
No.

2:21:43.053 --> 2:21:47.191
You were the best big brother
there ever was.

2:21:47.257 --> 2:21:50.027
No! We killed
our little brother!

2:21:51.562 --> 2:21:53.330
He loved you.

2:21:53.397 --> 2:21:55.032
And just because
you didn't want to play

2:21:55.099 --> 2:21:56.367
on a rainy day,

2:21:57.534 --> 2:21:59.203
just one time,

2:22:01.572 --> 2:22:03.574
that does not
make it our fault.

2:22:15.052 --> 2:22:16.553
And it never,

2:22:19.289 --> 2:22:20.924
ever...

2:22:23.627 --> 2:22:24.628
...did.

2:22:58.929 --> 2:23:00.130
Bill.

2:23:01.698 --> 2:23:03.033
Miss me?

2:23:04.535 --> 2:23:06.303
I know what you are.

2:23:06.370 --> 2:23:07.671
That's why
I'm not afraid.

2:23:14.311 --> 2:23:16.480
Well, I know
what you are.

2:23:18.549 --> 2:23:20.083
A madman.

2:23:26.557 --> 2:23:27.558
Hey, fuckface!

2:23:34.531 --> 2:23:36.200
You wanna play
Truth or Dare?

2:23:36.266 --> 2:23:37.534
Here's a truth.

2:23:37.601 --> 2:23:39.203
You're a sloppy bitch!

2:23:39.269 --> 2:23:40.370
Yeah, that's right!

2:23:40.437 --> 2:23:43.006
Let's dance!
Yippee-ki-yay...

2:24:16.206 --> 2:24:18.475
This kills monsters.

2:24:19.343 --> 2:24:21.345
If you believe it does.

2:24:21.411 --> 2:24:23.213
If you believe it does.

2:24:24.014 --> 2:24:25.516
If you believe it does.

2:24:26.416 --> 2:24:28.118
If you believe it does.

2:24:30.187 --> 2:24:33.156
Beep-beep,
motherfucker!

2:24:51.943 --> 2:24:53.011
Holy shit!

2:24:57.548 --> 2:24:58.649
Rich!

2:24:58.715 --> 2:25:00.083
Oh, Rich!

2:25:00.150 --> 2:25:01.785
Hey, Rich,
wake up!

2:25:01.853 --> 2:25:03.120
Hey.

2:25:03.186 --> 2:25:04.755
Yeah, yeah! There he is, buddy!

2:25:04.821 --> 2:25:06.256
Hey, Richie, listen!

2:25:06.323 --> 2:25:07.658
I think
I got him, man!

2:25:09.994 --> 2:25:11.328
I think I killed It!

2:25:11.395 --> 2:25:12.897
I did! I think
I killed It for real!

2:25:17.801 --> 2:25:18.802
Eddie.

2:25:21.572 --> 2:25:22.573
Richie.

2:25:25.776 --> 2:25:26.878
Richie.

2:25:31.748 --> 2:25:32.749
No!

2:25:34.084 --> 2:25:35.319
Eddie.

2:25:36.787 --> 2:25:39.089
Uh-oh!

2:25:40.791 --> 2:25:41.792
No!

2:25:55.039 --> 2:25:56.306
Eddie!

2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:04.147
Eds!

2:26:05.016 --> 2:26:07.217
- Eds! Eds!
- Eddie!

2:26:07.284 --> 2:26:08.752
Eds,
come on, man.

2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:11.521
Be careful!
Be careful!

2:26:22.165 --> 2:26:24.501
Come out
and play, Losers!

2:26:26.004 --> 2:26:27.471
He's hurt.
He's hurt really bad.

2:26:27.537 --> 2:26:28.839
We gotta
get him out of here.

2:26:28.906 --> 2:26:30.273
How are we supposed
to do that, Richie?

2:26:34.144 --> 2:26:35.746
I almost killed It.

2:26:37.048 --> 2:26:38.248
The leper.

2:26:39.149 --> 2:26:41.318
My hands
around his throat.

2:26:41.385 --> 2:26:43.587
And I could feel
him choking.

2:26:44.956 --> 2:26:46.757
I made him small.

2:26:52.096 --> 2:26:53.330
He seemed so weak.

2:26:56.166 --> 2:26:57.768
He seemed so weak.

2:26:58.735 --> 2:26:59.770
The Shokopiwah.

2:27:01.405 --> 2:27:02.706
All living things
must abide by

2:27:02.773 --> 2:27:04.274
the laws of the shape
they inhabit.

2:27:05.275 --> 2:27:06.810
Guys!

2:27:06.878 --> 2:27:08.946
There's a passageway.
Through here.

2:27:10.247 --> 2:27:12.349
The tunnel.

2:27:12.416 --> 2:27:14.351
Pennywise has to
make himself small

2:27:14.418 --> 2:27:17.521
to get through the entrance
of the cavern, right?

2:27:17.587 --> 2:27:18.923
Okay, so, if we can get back
there, we can

2:27:18.990 --> 2:27:21.125
- force him down to size.
- Yeah.

2:27:21.191 --> 2:27:24.394
We make him small.
Small enough so we can kill him.

2:27:26.563 --> 2:27:29.934
I can smell
the stink of your fear!

2:27:31.468 --> 2:27:33.470
- Let's go! Go!
- Come on! Come on!

2:27:33.537 --> 2:27:35.338
It's tight. It's tight.
Be careful!

2:27:49.553 --> 2:27:52.857
I need a little rest.
Oh, thanks.

2:27:54.025 --> 2:27:55.625
Hey.

2:27:55.692 --> 2:27:56.727
Hey, Richie?

2:27:56.793 --> 2:27:58.062
I gotta
tell you something.

2:27:58.129 --> 2:27:59.730
What?
What's up, buddy?

2:28:02.900 --> 2:28:03.901
I fucked your mother.

2:28:08.505 --> 2:28:10.340
Losers out!

2:28:13.144 --> 2:28:14.344
Go. Go!

2:28:25.422 --> 2:28:26.623
Gotcha!

2:28:27.925 --> 2:28:29.493
Whoa!

2:28:29.559 --> 2:28:32.897
You filthy little children.

2:28:34.631 --> 2:28:36.067
You got a plan B, man?
What the hell do we do now?

2:28:36.134 --> 2:28:37.801
You die.
That's what you do.

2:28:38.835 --> 2:28:40.004
Mike?

2:28:42.606 --> 2:28:44.407
There's more than one way
to make someone small.

2:28:46.676 --> 2:28:47.577
Oh!

2:28:47.644 --> 2:28:49.780
Make him
believe that he is.

2:28:49.846 --> 2:28:51.715
- What?
- Make him believe that he is.

2:28:51.782 --> 2:28:55.318
Oh? Me?
Small?

2:28:56.353 --> 2:28:59.422
I am
the Eater of Worlds.

2:28:59.489 --> 2:29:00.690
Not to us,
you're not.

2:29:03.426 --> 2:29:04.828
You're just a clown.

2:29:10.134 --> 2:29:11.501
You're a weak old woman.

2:29:14.337 --> 2:29:17.008
The Eater of Worlds.

2:29:17.074 --> 2:29:18.441
A headless boy!

2:29:20.343 --> 2:29:21.845
Impostor!

2:29:23.313 --> 2:29:24.781
You're a mimic!

2:29:27.051 --> 2:29:28.685
A mimic!

2:29:28.752 --> 2:29:31.588
You're a fucking bully!

2:29:31.655 --> 2:29:33.323
You're just
a fucking clown!

2:29:33.390 --> 2:29:34.524
Eater of Worlds!

2:29:34.591 --> 2:29:36.626
A clown!
A dumb fucking clown!

2:29:37.828 --> 2:29:39.496
Clown!

2:29:41.098 --> 2:29:43.134
A leper!

2:29:43.201 --> 2:29:45.036
You're a clown!

2:29:45.102 --> 2:29:46.369
You're a clown!

2:29:46.436 --> 2:29:47.571
A painting!

2:29:47.637 --> 2:29:48.940
You're a clown!

2:29:49.006 --> 2:29:50.340
I'm not afraid
of you anymore!

2:29:50.407 --> 2:29:53.277
A motherfucking
stupid mummy!

2:29:53.343 --> 2:29:54.544
You're a clown!

2:29:55.980 --> 2:29:57.814
Clown! Clown!

2:29:59.616 --> 2:30:01.953
- Clown!
- Clown!

2:30:02.019 --> 2:30:04.188
You're a fucking clown!

2:30:04.255 --> 2:30:05.622
You're a clown!

2:30:05.689 --> 2:30:07.824
- A stupid mummy!
- Clown!

2:30:09.193 --> 2:30:10.527
Clown, motherfucker!

2:30:10.594 --> 2:30:13.865
I am the Eater of Worlds!

2:30:18.435 --> 2:30:20.437
Clown!

2:30:20.503 --> 2:30:23.107
- Clown!
- You're just a clown! Clown!

2:30:23.174 --> 2:30:25.877
- I am the Eater of Worlds!
- A clown!

2:30:25.943 --> 2:30:27.410
Whoa!

2:30:27.477 --> 2:30:29.579
A clown! A clown!

2:30:31.648 --> 2:30:33.985
No one's
afraid of you.

2:30:34.051 --> 2:30:35.485
No one's scared of you.

2:30:37.088 --> 2:30:39.389
Clown! Clown!

2:30:40.390 --> 2:30:44.095
Clown. Clown. Clown.

2:30:46.529 --> 2:30:48.698
- Clown.
- Clown.

2:30:50.902 --> 2:30:52.836
A clown.

2:30:52.904 --> 2:30:54.939
With a scared,
beating heart.

2:31:42.519 --> 2:31:44.889
Look at you.

2:31:46.290 --> 2:31:51.128
You're all grown up.

2:32:54.492 --> 2:32:55.725
Eddie. Eddie.

2:32:59.397 --> 2:33:01.564
Eddie.
We got Pennywise, man.

2:33:03.666 --> 2:33:04.869
Eddie?

2:33:17.680 --> 2:33:18.883
Richie.

2:33:19.517 --> 2:33:20.750
He's gone.

2:33:20.817 --> 2:33:22.253
He's all right.
No, he's just hurt.

2:33:22.319 --> 2:33:24.654
We gotta get him outta here.
He's hurt. Ben.

2:33:24.721 --> 2:33:26.057
Bill, he's okay.
We gotta get him outta here.

2:33:26.123 --> 2:33:27.124
Bev.

2:33:28.225 --> 2:33:29.692
Richie.

2:33:32.430 --> 2:33:33.730
What?

2:33:33.797 --> 2:33:35.732
Honey, he's dead.

2:33:39.103 --> 2:33:41.338
We have to go. Come on.
Come on, Richie.

2:33:41.405 --> 2:33:42.973
We gotta go.

2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:44.741
Come on, buddy. Come on.

2:33:48.611 --> 2:33:49.846
Let him go, man.
Let him go.

2:33:49.914 --> 2:33:51.848
Got it.

2:33:51.916 --> 2:33:54.651
We can still help him, guys!
We can still help him!

2:33:55.652 --> 2:33:56.820
Go! Go! Get up!

2:33:56.887 --> 2:33:59.090
Guys, we can
still help him!

2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:12.870
No! Eddie!

2:34:13.304 --> 2:34:14.771
Eddie!

2:34:19.076 --> 2:34:20.277
Come on!
Let's go!

2:34:25.316 --> 2:34:26.317
Come on! Let's go!

2:34:29.253 --> 2:34:30.254
Move, move!

2:34:36.626 --> 2:34:38.462
- Move, move!
- Run!

2:34:38.529 --> 2:34:39.729
Run!

2:34:53.710 --> 2:34:55.146
- Eddie!
- No, no, no!

2:34:55.212 --> 2:34:56.213
Eddie!

2:34:57.948 --> 2:35:00.317
We gotta get in there
and get him!

2:35:00.384 --> 2:35:02.052
He's still in there!

2:35:12.695 --> 2:35:14.064
Eddie!

2:35:14.565 --> 2:35:15.866
Eddie!

2:36:15.526 --> 2:36:16.961
You know what?

2:36:17.027 --> 2:36:20.197
Eddie would have
hated this, guys.

2:36:20.264 --> 2:36:23.367
What? Cleaning ourselves
in dirty water?

2:36:23.434 --> 2:36:24.902
Yeah.

2:36:24.969 --> 2:36:27.705
He'd be telling us we'd get
streptococcal something.

2:36:27.770 --> 2:36:29.940
Yeah.

2:36:30.007 --> 2:36:31.442
But he would have
made us laugh, though.

2:36:31.508 --> 2:36:33.043
Oh, yeah.

2:36:33.110 --> 2:36:35.079
He'd be
looking out for us.

2:36:36.813 --> 2:36:38.848
The way he always was.

2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:44.521
Ain't that right, Richie?

2:36:47.091 --> 2:36:48.092
Hey.

2:37:18.788 --> 2:37:19.990
Oh.

2:37:20.724 --> 2:37:21.824
Thank you.

2:37:21.892 --> 2:37:23.494
I don't have
my glasses on,

2:37:23.560 --> 2:37:24.728
so I don't know who you people
are, but thank you.

2:37:27.797 --> 2:37:29.433
I legit
can't find my glasses.

2:37:29.500 --> 2:37:30.734
You're serious?

2:37:30.800 --> 2:37:32.136
- Glasses?
- Go that way.

2:37:32.202 --> 2:37:33.803
Around here somewhere?

2:37:39.610 --> 2:37:41.245
- I can't see them.
- Oh, I see them. Right there.

2:37:41.312 --> 2:37:43.647
- Where?
- Look. Right...

2:37:43.714 --> 2:37:45.115
If you just go, like...

2:37:45.883 --> 2:37:47.318
Anybody have any luck?

2:38:49.446 --> 2:38:50.447
Hey, guys.

2:38:52.316 --> 2:38:53.384
Look.

2:39:02.993 --> 2:39:04.528
Nothing lasts forever.

2:39:24.948 --> 2:39:26.650
I can't go home
like this, guys.

2:39:27.518 --> 2:39:28.685
My mom will kill me.

2:39:28.752 --> 2:39:31.121
Dude, you've been gone
for 24 straight hours.

2:39:31.188 --> 2:39:33.390
Your face is definitely
on a milk carton by now.

2:39:33.457 --> 2:39:36.026
Also, that puke smells worse
than your mom's slippers.

2:39:36.093 --> 2:39:37.294
Oh, shut up, Richie.

2:39:37.361 --> 2:39:38.796
Okay, first of all,
my mom's slippers

2:39:38.863 --> 2:39:40.764
smell like potpourri, asshole.

2:39:40.831 --> 2:39:42.299
No, they don't.

2:39:42.366 --> 2:39:43.667
Yes, they do.
And, also, how would you know

2:39:43.734 --> 2:39:45.335
what they smell like
in the first place?

2:39:45.402 --> 2:39:46.470
Can we
just keep it quiet,

2:39:46.537 --> 2:39:48.205
please,
until we get home?

2:39:48.272 --> 2:39:49.640
"Potpourri" is
literally a French word

2:39:49.706 --> 2:39:51.375
meaning "rotten pot."

2:39:51.442 --> 2:39:52.342
I knew there
was something rotten about it.

2:40:14.097 --> 2:40:16.366
- Mike?
- <i>Hey.</i>

2:40:16.433 --> 2:40:18.635
I just thought
I'd check up on you.

2:40:18.702 --> 2:40:20.003
You know,
just to see if you learned

2:40:20.070 --> 2:40:21.371
how to finish
a book for once.

2:40:23.607 --> 2:40:25.409
I just finished
the first chapter.

2:40:27.144 --> 2:40:30.681
And I think I actually know
where I'm going this time.

2:40:31.415 --> 2:40:32.349
Good.

2:40:32.416 --> 2:40:34.418
Say, can I ask
you a question?

2:40:34.485 --> 2:40:35.652
<i>Sure.</i>

2:40:37.187 --> 2:40:39.089
Why do you think
we're not forgetting?

2:40:39.990 --> 2:40:41.893
You know, like last time?

2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:43.694
Maybe 'cause It's dead.

2:40:46.898 --> 2:40:48.265
Or maybe 'cause
we have more

2:40:48.332 --> 2:40:50.801
we want to remember
than we want to forget.

2:40:50.869 --> 2:40:52.402
I like that one.

2:40:56.273 --> 2:40:57.341
You decide
what you want to do?

2:40:57.407 --> 2:40:58.742
<i>About leaving Derry?</i>

2:40:58.809 --> 2:41:01.178
Man, I've been in this cell
for 27 years.

2:41:02.546 --> 2:41:04.114
Just seeing
what It wanted me to.

2:41:07.886 --> 2:41:10.621
I think it's time I saw
the sky for a change.

2:41:11.755 --> 2:41:13.925
<i>Go get it, Mikey.</i>

2:41:13.992 --> 2:41:15.559
Oh, did you get the letter?

2:41:16.793 --> 2:41:18.095
What letter?

2:41:18.161 --> 2:41:20.932
You'll know
when you see it.

2:41:20.999 --> 2:41:23.066
Well, hold on.
I just got the mail.

2:41:23.133 --> 2:41:24.635
<i>We all got one.</i>

2:41:27.237 --> 2:41:28.472
Patricia Uris?

2:41:29.439 --> 2:41:30.440
<i>Just...</i>

2:41:31.608 --> 2:41:32.944
Just read it.

2:41:33.011 --> 2:41:34.111
Okay.

2:41:34.177 --> 2:41:36.413
<i>And call me.
Anytime.</i>

2:41:37.180 --> 2:41:38.482
I will.

2:41:38.549 --> 2:41:39.616
<i>And, Bill,</i>

2:41:45.255 --> 2:41:47.524
I love you, man.

2:41:47.591 --> 2:41:49.326
I love you, too.

2:41:49.393 --> 2:41:51.762
<i>All right.
See you around.</i>

2:42:18.923 --> 2:42:21.291
<i>Dear Losers,</i>

2:42:21.358 --> 2:42:23.327
<i>I know what this must seem like,</i>

2:42:23.393 --> 2:42:25.195
<i>but this isn't
a suicide note.</i>

2:42:26.965 --> 2:42:30.667
<i>You're probably wondering
why I did what I did.</i>

2:42:30.734 --> 2:42:33.770
<i>It's because I knew I was
too scared to go back.</i>

2:42:33.837 --> 2:42:35.839
<i>And if
we weren't together,</i>

2:42:35.907 --> 2:42:39.276
<i>if all of us alive
weren't united,</i>

2:42:39.343 --> 2:42:41.578
<i>I knew we'd all die.</i>

2:42:41.645 --> 2:42:46.017
<i>So, I made
the only logical move.</i>

2:42:46.084 --> 2:42:47.784
<i>I took myself
off the board.</i>

2:42:50.054 --> 2:42:51.655
<i>Did it work?</i>

2:42:53.323 --> 2:42:55.359
<i>Well, if you're reading
this, you know the answer.</i>

2:42:57.694 --> 2:42:59.663
<i>I lived
my whole life afraid.</i>

2:43:01.531 --> 2:43:05.602
<i>Afraid of
what would come next.</i>

2:43:05.669 --> 2:43:07.738
<i>Afraid of what
I might leave behind.</i>

2:43:10.707 --> 2:43:11.742
<i>Don't.</i>

2:43:13.777 --> 2:43:15.880
<i>Be who you want to be.</i>

2:43:17.147 --> 2:43:18.715
<i>Be proud.</i>

2:43:19.449 --> 2:43:21.085
You sleep okay?

2:43:21.151 --> 2:43:22.486
Yeah.

2:43:23.420 --> 2:43:25.455
I had a beautiful dream.

2:43:25.522 --> 2:43:28.358
<i>And if you find
someone worth holding on to,</i>

2:43:29.559 --> 2:43:32.429
<i>never ever let them go.</i>

2:43:41.005 --> 2:43:42.673
<i>Follow your own path.</i>

2:43:47.310 --> 2:43:48.812
<i>Wherever that takes you.</i>

2:43:55.352 --> 2:43:58.488
<i>Think of this letter
as a promise.</i>

2:44:01.491 --> 2:44:03.627
<i>A promise
I'm asking you to make.</i>

2:44:04.862 --> 2:44:05.863
<i>To me.</i>

2:44:07.098 --> 2:44:08.432
<i>To each other.</i>

2:44:10.367 --> 2:44:11.802
<i>An oath.</i>

2:44:15.672 --> 2:44:17.708
<i>See,
the thing about being a Loser</i>

2:44:20.410 --> 2:44:22.479
<i>is you don't have
anything to lose.</i>

2:44:25.149 --> 2:44:27.085
<i>So...</i>

2:44:27.151 --> 2:44:29.087
<i>Be true.</i>

2:44:29.153 --> 2:44:30.353
<i>Be brave.</i>

2:44:31.388 --> 2:44:32.589
<i>Stand.</i>

2:44:33.356 --> 2:44:35.325
<i>Believe.</i>

2:44:35.392 --> 2:44:37.694
<i>And don't ever forget...</i>

2:44:38.829 --> 2:44:40.297
<i>We're Losers,</i>

2:44:41.565 --> 2:44:43.533
<i>and we always will be.</i>
