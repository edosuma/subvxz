WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:04.034
(Gunshot)

00:04.035 --> 00:06.005
(Gasps and grunts)

00:06.006 --> 00:07.737
(Groans)

00:07.738 --> 00:10.180
(Thud)

00:10.181 --> 00:13.184
(Exhales)

00:17.518 --> 00:20.019
(Siren wails)

00:20.020 --> 00:21.721
Oh, why, thank you, sir.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.224
I thought you were supposed
to have the day off today.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.196
Had the whole
thing planned out...

00:26.197 --> 00:28.798
A new book, an old Bordeaux,

00:28.799 --> 00:30.460
and some stinky cheese.

00:30.461 --> 00:32.132
So what happened?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.633
Short-staffed, I guess.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.136
Dr. Matheson's wife had a baby.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.369
(Coos) Oh! I didn't even
know he was married.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.040
I'm shocked.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.473
(Morris) You printed it, right?

00:43.474 --> 00:45.275
Turn the infernal thing off, would
you? (Woman speaks indistinctly on TV)

00:45.276 --> 00:47.717
Good morning, detective.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.449
Soon to be afternoon, then night

00:49.450 --> 00:51.451
and then the whole
monotonous shebang

00:51.452 --> 00:54.053
just "groundhog
days" back up on itself.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.226
This girl could be
hardly more than 24.

00:56.227 --> 00:59.159
23. Elena rosas. I.D.
Says she's from wynnefield.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.830
The body was
discovered by the maid

01:00.831 --> 01:04.534
after she heard the gunshot. Did she
have any personal belongings, luggage?

01:04.535 --> 01:07.297
Just a purse. There was
a cell phone and a wallet,

01:07.298 --> 01:10.140
but no money or car keys.
Maybe a robbery gone bad, huh?

01:10.141 --> 01:13.143
She's well-groomed,
nicely dressed.

01:13.144 --> 01:15.375
She doesn't belong here.
(Camera shutter clicking)

01:15.376 --> 01:18.348
There is a distinct lack
of blood around the body,

01:18.349 --> 01:21.551
and people don't usually die
from a single gunshot wound

01:21.552 --> 01:24.514
to the arm. And here's where you
tell me she's actually made of straw

01:24.515 --> 01:27.387
or was born with three hearts.
How about instead you just

01:27.388 --> 01:30.220
give me the cause of death
so I can move on with my day?

01:30.221 --> 01:34.124
I'd be happy to, detective,
if I knew what it was.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.526
(Man speaks indistinctly)

01:36.527 --> 01:38.268
(Sighs)

01:38.269 --> 01:40.770
Our victim paid cash
and didn't sign the register.

01:40.771 --> 01:42.272
Imagine that.

01:42.273 --> 01:45.275
What was she doing in
this place? I doubt it was for

01:45.276 --> 01:47.277
the continental breakfast
and the free Wi-Fi.

01:47.278 --> 01:50.140
Maybe she's a prostitute. She
was wearing a business suit.

01:50.141 --> 01:52.142
That's not exactly
the sexiest outfit.

01:52.143 --> 01:54.414
Unless you're into
that sort of thing.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.586
Anyway, in typical
no-tell motel fashion,

01:56.587 --> 01:57.887
our manager knows nothing,

01:57.888 --> 02:01.151
except that she showed
up in a car and, I quote,

02:01.152 --> 02:03.853
"one of those boxy
Japanese jobs."

02:03.854 --> 02:05.455
And now it's gone.

02:05.456 --> 02:07.657
Okay. Hey, what's
up with bud today?

02:07.658 --> 02:10.129
Oh. Again?

02:10.130 --> 02:14.134
Yep. It's gonna be
one of those days.

02:27.878 --> 02:31.851
Oh, sorry. Uh, I was just
rearranging your instruments.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.354
The new deaner had them
completely out of order.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.557
How do you know what
order I want them in?

02:37.558 --> 02:38.858
Well, you know,

02:38.859 --> 02:41.491
they don't call me "eagle
eye Ethan" for nothin'.

02:41.492 --> 02:44.534
(Chuckles) Nobody calls me that.

02:44.535 --> 02:47.937
Hey. Hey. What was that all about
this morning at the crime scene?

02:47.938 --> 02:49.939
What was what all about?

02:49.940 --> 02:53.543
You and Sam... the... the
arched eyebrows, the sighing.

02:53.544 --> 02:56.576
You mean to tell
me you didn't notice?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.878
There was a murder
victim to attend to.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.411
I think that takes
precedence over...

03:01.412 --> 03:03.913
Whatever it is you're
going to tell me.

03:03.914 --> 03:06.716
Bud's mood? The... the way
he was barking at everybody?

03:06.717 --> 03:09.459
(Ethan) Uh, isn't
he always like that?

03:09.460 --> 03:12.522
(Sighs) Bud is having problems with
his wife again. I thought he was divorced.

03:12.523 --> 03:15.194
(Chuckles) You
know, if you applied

03:15.195 --> 03:17.927
that laser focus you have
to the people around you,

03:17.928 --> 03:19.929
you wouldn't have to ask.

03:19.930 --> 03:22.402
Elena rosas looks to be

03:22.403 --> 03:24.904
in very good physical condition.

03:24.905 --> 03:29.279
She has two
lacerations on the gums

03:29.280 --> 03:31.481
above the right
upper lateral incisor.

03:31.482 --> 03:34.614
Some kind of dry
liquid on her blouse.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.616
Run that after
you put the clothes

03:36.617 --> 03:39.489
on the drying rack,
please. No problem.

03:39.490 --> 03:41.491
Also swab this right forefinger.

03:41.492 --> 03:44.754
Looks like there's some
kind of blue ink on it.

03:44.755 --> 03:46.756
Bruises on the right forearm.

03:46.757 --> 03:48.958
Matching ones on her left.

03:48.959 --> 03:51.631
Hmm. Cuts in the
mouth, bruises on the arm.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.233
Looks like she might have
tried to fight off her killer.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.765
(Singsongy) Ohh.

03:55.766 --> 03:58.908
(Normal voice) That's why
she didn't bleed very much.

03:58.909 --> 04:01.010
It's an a.B.C. Wound. A.B.C.?

04:01.011 --> 04:03.012
"A" being the
initial entry wound.

04:03.013 --> 04:05.515
The bullet travels
through the arm,

04:05.516 --> 04:08.678
providing "b," the exit wound. And
"c" is the reentry wound into her torso.

04:08.679 --> 04:11.981
And the arm was pressed
against the body as she fell,

04:11.982 --> 04:16.255
preventing blood loss. So she
was killed by a shot in the arm.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.727
Let's get some pictures.

04:17.728 --> 04:20.660
There's the bullet.
It's in bad shape.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.961
It's not unusual,

04:21.962 --> 04:25.335
since it impacted several
bones on its way in.

04:25.336 --> 04:28.037
Looks like it punctured
the ascending aorta.

04:28.038 --> 04:30.500
She bled out internally.

04:30.501 --> 04:33.042
So that's our cause of death.

04:33.043 --> 04:35.845
I know that bud and Sam are
tearing that motel room apart,

04:35.846 --> 04:37.847
but it's gonna be near
impossible for them

04:37.848 --> 04:39.949
to tie a deformed bullet
to the shooter's gun

04:39.950 --> 04:42.453
without the striations.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.855
Megan.

04:45.856 --> 04:47.917
Come back to me.

04:47.918 --> 04:50.320
Look at that.

04:50.321 --> 04:52.892
Surgical clips.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.465
She had brain surgery.

04:58.529 --> 05:01.070
I have to see what
was done to her.

05:01.071 --> 05:03.874
Once a neurosurgeon...
(Chuckles)

05:10.781 --> 05:12.982
Scarring looks to be

05:12.983 --> 05:15.815
at least... A few years old.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.019
Clean sutures. Nice work.

05:32.403 --> 05:34.904
Oh, my god.

05:34.905 --> 05:36.567
What? What is it?

05:41.111 --> 05:43.414
This girl...

05:47.017 --> 05:50.079
She was one of my patients.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.021
(Fabric snaps)

05:52.022 --> 05:54.024
♪♪♪

06:04.635 --> 06:07.798
(Sighs) How are you doing?

06:10.571 --> 06:14.404
How could I not
recognize a former patient?

06:14.405 --> 06:17.877
I'm still wondering what
tipped you off exactly.

06:17.878 --> 06:18.948
(Sighs)

06:18.949 --> 06:21.150
Neurosurgeons
all perform surgery

06:21.151 --> 06:23.152
in their own unique way.

06:23.153 --> 06:25.114
It's... it's almost
like a signature.

06:25.115 --> 06:27.817
Some drill more than
one hole in the skull,

06:27.818 --> 06:31.160
and for that particular
surgery, I usually drilled three.

06:31.161 --> 06:34.664
I also beveled the bone edges
so that they were smoothed,

06:34.665 --> 06:37.697
and used 5-millimeter burr hole
covers to cap the bone removal.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.470
And those surgical clips...
(Kate) Medical file came for you.

06:40.471 --> 06:43.402
From northeast general...
Isn't that where you...

06:43.403 --> 06:45.905
You're welcome. Isn't that
where you used to work?

06:45.906 --> 06:48.407
Elena rosas was
one of her patients.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.909
Six years ago.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.483
She had an arteriovenous
malformation in her brain.

06:53.484 --> 06:55.985
Abnormal tangle of blood
vessels. It forms before birth.

06:55.986 --> 06:58.888
You can live your whole life
and not even know you have one,

06:58.889 --> 07:01.491
but she slipped near
a swimming pool,

07:01.492 --> 07:04.494
causing hers to rupture. Hmm.

07:04.495 --> 07:07.627
You saved her life. You think
that would make me remember her.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.630
Megan, you've had hundreds
of patients, before and after.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.633
You can't possibly be expected to
remember... wait. I do remember her.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.735
I couldn't embolize
the deep feeders

07:15.736 --> 07:17.737
from the left middle
cerebral artery

07:17.738 --> 07:20.740
because of the risk of aphasia
so I mobilized the a.V.M. Nidus.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.743
That's good, right? I can't
remember Elena rosas as a patient,

07:23.744 --> 07:26.776
but I can remember her
as a surgical procedure?

07:26.777 --> 07:29.949
A lot's changed
since then. Has it?

07:29.950 --> 07:32.021
Where you going?

07:32.022 --> 07:35.024
I am going to apologize
to her the only way I can...

07:35.025 --> 07:37.086
Try to find her killer.

07:37.087 --> 07:39.959
Excuse me. I was told to see...

07:39.960 --> 07:41.962
Dr. Hunt?

07:44.735 --> 07:47.236
Mr. Rosas.

07:47.237 --> 07:49.599
Oh.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.140
(Elevator bell dings)

07:51.141 --> 07:52.842
Oh, hey.

07:52.843 --> 07:55.845
Ethan, did you run those
trace samples on Elena rosas?

07:55.846 --> 07:57.977
Yeah. Yeah. The, uh,
the blue dye on her finger

07:57.978 --> 08:00.479
was too diluted to
get a reading on,

08:00.480 --> 08:03.152
but the crusty trace on
her... blouse was milk.

08:03.153 --> 08:06.756
Milk? What kind? Uh... human.

08:06.757 --> 08:09.158
Go ahead and say
it, Ethan. (Chuckles)

08:09.159 --> 08:12.892
Breast milk. Go on. Okay,
I don't have to. You just did.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.695
So her baby spit up on her.
Except Elena wasn't lactating,

08:15.696 --> 08:18.698
and we didn't see any changes
in the shape of her cervical os.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.700
So she's never
even been pregnant.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.032
Well, whose baby was it then?

08:23.033 --> 08:26.576
Uh, well, we... that test doesn't
really give us a name. (Scoffs)

08:26.577 --> 08:28.578
Or am I missing something?

08:28.579 --> 08:31.040
(Door closes) I didn't
expect to see you here.

08:31.041 --> 08:32.912
You're, uh, no longer

08:32.913 --> 08:34.714
with northeast, uh, general?

08:34.715 --> 08:38.217
Uh, no, I-I gave up my
practice a few years ago.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.589
Oh.

08:39.590 --> 08:41.891
I'm a medical examiner now.

08:41.892 --> 08:43.924
Oh, so you've seen...

08:45.225 --> 08:47.096
(Voice breaks) My baby?

08:47.097 --> 08:49.559
I am so sorry, Mr. Rosas.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.002
(Sighs deeply) You know...

08:53.003 --> 08:55.865
You were actually a
big influence on her.

08:55.866 --> 08:58.067
I was? Yeah. You...
you remember.

08:58.068 --> 09:01.070
Uh, Elena's mother died
when she was very young.

09:01.071 --> 09:04.043
Uh, she grew up without
many women around,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.816
no role models.

09:06.817 --> 09:10.750
And then she fell and
needed the operation.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.982
When she opened her eyes again,

09:12.983 --> 09:15.024
you were the first
thing she saw...

09:15.025 --> 09:17.056
This brilliant woman who...

09:17.057 --> 09:19.629
Gave her her life back.

09:19.630 --> 09:21.230
She decided then she...

09:21.231 --> 09:23.593
Wanted to make a difference,

09:23.594 --> 09:25.034
like you.

09:25.035 --> 09:26.636
Oh.

09:26.637 --> 09:28.668
Thank you for telling me that.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.670
She became a social worker

09:30.671 --> 09:33.072
with, uh, child
protective services.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.975
She sounds like an
admirable young woman.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.077
(Chuckles) She was...

09:38.078 --> 09:40.249
Hardworking, selfless,

09:40.250 --> 09:42.251
never took time for herself.

09:42.252 --> 09:45.214
(Chuckles) I urged her
to move out of the house,

09:45.215 --> 09:47.256
to find somebody.

09:47.257 --> 09:49.018
Maybe...

09:49.019 --> 09:51.060
Start her own family.

09:51.061 --> 09:54.293
She said there were
too many other families

09:54.294 --> 09:57.227
to take care of first.

10:01.802 --> 10:05.375
(Voice breaks) Oh, how
could anybody do this to her?

10:07.838 --> 10:12.742
We are going to
find out, Mr. Rosas.

10:12.743 --> 10:15.886
I promise you that.

10:20.851 --> 10:22.152
(Door hinge squeaks)

10:24.655 --> 10:27.156
Elena's supervisor's
on a phone call.

10:27.157 --> 10:29.999
He'll be right with
us. Where's bud?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.202
I convinced him to take a
long lunch. Because of his wife?

10:33.203 --> 10:35.134
(Children speak indistinctly)

10:35.135 --> 10:37.166
What? (Man) Sorry about that.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.337
Jeremy Nichols.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.039
I can't believe what happened.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.012
Mr. Nichols, we just have
a few questions for you.

10:43.013 --> 10:45.815
How long did Elena work
here? Uh, about a year and a half.

10:45.816 --> 10:48.978
And your department oversees
the city's foster care program?

10:48.979 --> 10:50.379
They also investigate

10:50.380 --> 10:53.152
any reported incidences
of child abuse or neglect.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.155
Um, that's correct. So it
would be pretty standard

10:56.156 --> 10:59.158
for Elena to get in the
middle of volatile situations?

10:59.159 --> 11:02.992
All too standard. Did Elena
ever receive any threats?

11:02.993 --> 11:06.095
Well, if she did, she
never mentioned any.

11:06.096 --> 11:08.938
She was pretty tough. I really
admired her. Can we see her cases?

11:08.939 --> 11:10.900
Uh, sure.

11:10.901 --> 11:13.903
We're all forced to bite
off more than we can chew,

11:13.904 --> 11:17.676
but Elena always handled her share
and more. (Megan) How do you mean?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.009
Well, we're pressured to
close cases within 30 days,

11:20.010 --> 11:23.052
but she did follow-up
visits for as long as it took.

11:23.053 --> 11:26.055
As long as what took? For her to be
sure that the minor was being treated

11:26.056 --> 11:28.788
in a way that satisfiedher
and not just the system.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.761
With our volume, you
can start to see these kids

11:31.762 --> 11:33.923
as case files and statistics,

11:33.924 --> 11:37.126
but she really got to know
each and every one of them.

11:37.127 --> 11:39.128
Did Elena ever have any business

11:39.129 --> 11:42.401
at the midtowner motel on
Jackson street? Well, I can't see why.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.304
That area's not even in her territory.
Then where was she supposed to be?

11:45.305 --> 11:48.037
Well, she had five home
visits scheduled this morning,

11:48.038 --> 11:50.709
but I have no way of
knowing which ones

11:50.710 --> 11:54.213
she got around to actually visiting. I do.
She had dried breast milk on her blouse.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.916
Do any of those
cases involve a baby?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.848
(Buzzes)

11:58.849 --> 12:00.389
(Buzz)

12:00.390 --> 12:02.121
(Wheels clattering)

12:02.122 --> 12:04.053
(Laughs)

12:04.054 --> 12:05.925
(Wheels continue clattering)

12:05.926 --> 12:07.296
(Woman) Hello?

12:07.297 --> 12:09.198
(Sam) You Holly Bennett?

12:09.199 --> 12:12.261
Sorry. Uh, we were on a
walk when I got your call.

12:12.262 --> 12:15.434
I came as soon as
I could. Here, baby.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.807
I'll just be a second, okay?

12:17.808 --> 12:20.169
Um... Elena was killed?

12:20.170 --> 12:22.211
But I just saw her this morning.

12:22.212 --> 12:23.813
We realize that,

12:23.814 --> 12:26.916
which is why we've come to ask a
few questions. Oh, sure. What about?

12:26.917 --> 12:29.048
Child protective services
stopped by a few months ago

12:29.049 --> 12:31.380
to investigate a possible
domestic violence situation.

12:31.381 --> 12:35.184
Yeah, it was just my boyfriend
Freddy. He yelled a lot.

12:35.185 --> 12:37.456
Yeah, Elena didn't find
any evidence of abuse,

12:37.457 --> 12:39.859
but she did find cocaine.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.091
Didn't she take your
baby away from you

12:42.092 --> 12:44.763
until the two of you
were drug tested?

12:44.764 --> 12:47.937
Yeah, those drugs were
Freddy's. I never touched the stuff.

12:47.938 --> 12:50.169
And the test proved
it. I got Tessa back.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.842
(Peter) We checked every home
that she was supposed to visit,

12:52.843 --> 12:54.974
and she never
made it to any of 'em.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.077
That's a long time to spend just with
you. Yeah. She noticed I was depressed.

12:58.078 --> 13:01.250
About what? Freddy.
I kicked him out.

13:01.251 --> 13:04.083
Thanks to Elena. I mean,
she said being a parent

13:04.084 --> 13:06.856
was a lot more
than just biology,

13:06.857 --> 13:10.059
that you had to earn the right.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.061
I don't regret it at all,

13:12.062 --> 13:15.195
but, you know, sometimes
it's hard being alone.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.869
Did Elena hold your
baby when she was here?

13:19.870 --> 13:22.301
Yeah. They were playing.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.004
She was great with kids.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.136
Tessa spit up on her.
She didn't even blink.

13:27.137 --> 13:29.138
She would have been a great mom.

13:29.139 --> 13:32.081
Do you have any idea
where she might have gone

13:32.082 --> 13:34.583
after she left your
house? I'm not sure.

13:34.584 --> 13:36.886
But she did get a phone call.

13:36.887 --> 13:39.218
Do you happen to know
who that might have been?

13:39.219 --> 13:41.320
No. But she sounded
a little stressed

13:41.321 --> 13:43.323
and she took off pretty quick.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.067
I just wanted to see
how things were going.

13:58.068 --> 14:00.239
Uh, Sam is poring
over Elena's case files.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.172
I wanted to get a
closer look at this bullet.

14:03.173 --> 14:07.146
No, I actually meant how
are things going with you?

14:07.147 --> 14:10.050
Fine. I'm fine.

14:12.983 --> 14:16.455
It's not that hard, you
know, to connect with people.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.087
Just take an interest.

14:18.088 --> 14:20.429
What are you talking about?

14:20.430 --> 14:22.131
(Sighs) Nothing.

14:22.132 --> 14:25.134
So the bullet... you were, um,
you were looking for something?

14:25.135 --> 14:27.396
Yeah. It is a .32

14:27.397 --> 14:29.939
and too deformed to
run through ballistics,

14:29.940 --> 14:31.300
just like Peter thought.

14:31.301 --> 14:34.573
But I thought I'd look to see
if there was anything else,

14:34.574 --> 14:37.276
like... that.

14:37.277 --> 14:40.109
There's something
caked on the bullet.

14:40.110 --> 14:42.351
So it hit something
before it entered our victim.

14:42.352 --> 14:46.285
Yeah, but notsomething.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.189
Someone.

15:01.171 --> 15:04.473
You found another person's
skin on the tip of the bullet?

15:04.474 --> 15:08.137
How the heck do you know it didn't belong
to the victim? Elena rosas was hispanic.

15:08.138 --> 15:11.180
That skin showed a
distinct lack of pigment.

15:11.181 --> 15:13.542
It's Caucasian. (Kate) We
sent a sample to the d.N.A. Lab.

15:13.543 --> 15:16.685
Maybe we'll get an I.D. So someone
else was shot in that motel room.

15:16.686 --> 15:19.318
The question is, did the
killer get shot in a struggle

15:19.319 --> 15:22.321
or do we have another victim out
there? C.S.U. Processed the entire room,

15:22.322 --> 15:24.393
and the only blood
they found was Elena's.

15:24.394 --> 15:27.356
There were no spatter patterns.
No spatter means no trajectory.

15:27.357 --> 15:29.528
We have no way of knowing

15:29.529 --> 15:32.531
where Elena was standing when
she was shot. And we have no idea

15:32.532 --> 15:35.664
where the shooter was standing in the room either.
We did find a busted-out window in the bathroom.

15:35.665 --> 15:38.207
That may have been the
killer's entry and exit points,

15:38.208 --> 15:41.070
but there were no biologicals. All
right, so where does that leave us?

15:41.071 --> 15:43.072
I'm still stuck on
what she was doing

15:43.073 --> 15:46.375
in that motel room in the first place. Holly
Bennett said that Elena got a phone call.

15:46.376 --> 15:49.248
From a pay phone. Are we
sure that Elena wasn't doing

15:49.249 --> 15:51.480
any other social services
on the side? (Chuckles)

15:51.481 --> 15:54.353
She wasn't a prostitute,
okay? Fine. Whatever.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.585
What happened here?

15:56.586 --> 16:00.329
Okay, could you...
Leave me alone?

16:00.330 --> 16:02.961
I'm just... saying,

16:02.962 --> 16:04.963
Sam spoke to Elena's father,

16:04.964 --> 16:07.296
and he didn't know of
anybody she was seeing.

16:07.297 --> 16:10.299
But if she did want to see
somebody under the radar,

16:10.300 --> 16:14.303
that motel would be the perfect place. I think he
would know. They were living under the same roof.

16:14.304 --> 16:17.276
But even the most observant
person in the world can miss

16:17.277 --> 16:19.408
what's going on
right in front of 'em.

16:19.409 --> 16:22.351
If you are so sure that
she was hiding something,

16:22.352 --> 16:25.054
then let's go find
out for ourselves.

16:25.055 --> 16:27.217
Fine. But we're taking two cars.

16:32.462 --> 16:35.064
Dr. Hunt. I'm sorry to
bother you, Mr. Rosas.

16:35.065 --> 16:37.296
This is my colleague,
detective bud Morris.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.328
Sir, I'm very
sorry for your loss.

16:39.329 --> 16:42.331
Thank you. Would
you mind if we came in?

16:42.332 --> 16:45.035
Oh, of course not.
Please. Come in.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.310
Please.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.482
Uh. You mentioned that, uh,

16:53.483 --> 16:55.484
you encouraged
Elena to get out more

16:55.485 --> 16:57.246
to try and meet somebody?

16:57.247 --> 16:59.488
Did she ever follow your advice?

16:59.489 --> 17:03.092
No. Like I told
the other detective,

17:03.093 --> 17:06.095
she never went
out, except for work.

17:06.096 --> 17:09.428
Would you mind if we took a
look at your daughter's bedroom?

17:09.429 --> 17:12.361
It's at the end of the hall.

17:12.362 --> 17:15.664
If you don't mind, I
can't go in. Not yet.

17:15.665 --> 17:17.207
Thank you.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.723
I heard you took a
long lunch yesterday.

17:37.187 --> 17:40.159
What are you, my time clock now?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.262
You want to talk about it?

17:43.693 --> 17:45.264
Talk about what?

17:45.265 --> 17:47.337
Your wife.

17:49.839 --> 17:52.541
I... I can't take an interest?

17:52.542 --> 17:55.304
Why now, all of a sudden?

17:55.305 --> 17:56.746
Never mind.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.281
(Drawer closes)

18:02.282 --> 18:07.356
She says I take her for
granted, then I blow up.

18:07.357 --> 18:09.158
Then she blows up.

18:09.159 --> 18:12.291
Tells me I'm married
more to my job than to her,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.193
that she's glad
we never had kids.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.865
I tell her, somebody's
gotta pay the mortgage,

18:16.866 --> 18:18.867
then she gets
pissed, kicks me out,

18:18.868 --> 18:21.330
my stuff goes flying
out the window.

18:21.331 --> 18:24.333
And I find myself picking
everything out of the bushes,

18:24.334 --> 18:27.337
wondering which hotel
has the best minibar.

18:35.285 --> 18:39.848
So much for sharing.

18:39.849 --> 18:42.252
(Grunts)

18:49.229 --> 18:51.360
Check it out.
"Philly floral works."

18:51.361 --> 18:55.164
Elena had an admirer.

18:55.165 --> 18:56.435
(Paper rustles)

18:56.436 --> 18:58.308
"Hope you reconsider."

19:00.240 --> 19:01.311
"Jeremy."

19:03.713 --> 19:06.515
Mr. Nichols, you
neglected to tell us

19:06.516 --> 19:10.148
you had a thing for Elena.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.321
We spent a lot of time together.

19:12.322 --> 19:13.652
It was natural.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.185
For you, maybe not for her.

19:16.186 --> 19:18.187
What were you hoping
she would reconsider

19:18.188 --> 19:22.291
when you gave her the flowers?

19:22.292 --> 19:24.363
We had a dinner date last week,

19:24.364 --> 19:25.664
but she canceled,

19:25.665 --> 19:29.368
said she didn't feel right
about going out with her boss.

19:29.369 --> 19:33.272
Sounds like she was trying to tell you to
leave her alone. No. No. She was just shy.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.704
I found this by the
trash. (Bag thuds)

19:35.705 --> 19:38.507
Guess the flowers didn't work.

19:38.508 --> 19:43.482
Believe me, I am a connoisseur
of failed romantic gestures.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.914
I bet you that
rejection pissed you off.

19:45.915 --> 19:49.318
Lift up your shirt
sleeves. What for?

19:49.319 --> 19:52.291
Caucasian skin was found
on the bullet that killed Elena.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.523
(Sighs)

20:00.730 --> 20:03.403
Take off the bandage, please.

20:04.734 --> 20:07.606
(Inhales sharply and grunts)

20:07.607 --> 20:09.678
Look like a bullet wound to you?

20:09.679 --> 20:12.241
No. It's a bite Mark.

20:12.242 --> 20:15.314
Are we done here? You're
not exactly off the hook.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.417
Elena had cuts in her mouth
and bruises on both arms.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.850
You get violent with
her? Hmm? Okay. Okay.

20:21.851 --> 20:25.223
I went over to her house
the day before she was killed,

20:25.224 --> 20:26.795
with the flowers.

20:26.796 --> 20:28.527
Her father was out.

20:28.528 --> 20:32.301
She read the card and
she just started freaking out.

20:32.302 --> 20:33.562
How so?

20:33.563 --> 20:35.364
Shaking, clenching her jaw...

20:35.365 --> 20:38.907
It was like she was having some
kind of seizure. What did you do?

20:38.908 --> 20:41.239
I tried to help her.
That's when she bit me.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.812
How long did the seizure last?

20:43.813 --> 20:47.716
(Sighs) I don't know. Not
more than 20, 30 seconds.

20:47.717 --> 20:49.418
What'd you do after?

20:49.419 --> 20:50.919
She was upset.

20:50.920 --> 20:55.324
She told me to take the
flowers and leave, so I did.

20:55.325 --> 20:58.728
That's the last time
I saw her. I swear.

21:01.891 --> 21:04.533
Curtis. Have you seen Ethan?

21:04.534 --> 21:06.365
Oh, wait.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.867
There it is.

21:09.839 --> 21:11.800
Your victim's brain?

21:11.801 --> 21:15.375
Mm-hmm. And our prime
suspect is saying she had a seizure.

21:23.813 --> 21:25.484
What? Nothing.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.856
Mnh-mnh. That
look's never nothing.

21:27.857 --> 21:30.288
Oh, I was just wondering
how you've been.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.361
Because I took
two personal days?

21:32.362 --> 21:34.823
They don't roll over, you know.

21:34.824 --> 21:36.826
No, that's not
what I meant. I...

21:38.328 --> 21:40.799
What'd you do? Anything fun?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.871
You've been riding
me since you got here,

21:42.872 --> 21:45.434
and now you want to
get to know me better?

21:45.435 --> 21:47.977
Fine. Be like that.

21:51.681 --> 21:54.443
The truth is, there's
not much to know.

21:54.444 --> 21:57.586
Ethan, on the other hand...
Now that boy's interesting.

21:57.587 --> 21:59.047
How so?

21:59.048 --> 22:01.420
He's an accomplished
chef of Indian food,

22:01.421 --> 22:03.692
likes extreme camping,

22:03.693 --> 22:06.795
and has memorized every
James Bond movie. Really?

22:06.796 --> 22:08.798
Oh, yeah. Girl, he's got layers.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.632
Huh.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.964
Thought you'd like to
know... D.N.A. Came back

22:15.965 --> 22:17.966
on the foreign
tissue from that bullet.

22:17.967 --> 22:20.739
P.d. Matched it to a
kid named Sean wilcox.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.041
Released from juvie two
days ago after serving time

22:23.042 --> 22:25.374
for weapons possession.
(Closes folder)

22:25.375 --> 22:27.376
Apparently, he's
got a cell phone.

22:27.377 --> 22:29.448
They're triangulating
the signal now.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.520
(The soft pack's
"c'mon" playing)

22:31.521 --> 22:33.052

22:41.661 --> 22:43.662

23:31.511 --> 23:34.513
(Peter) You knew Elena
rosas. She was your caseworker.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.515
She was assigned
to you a year ago

23:36.516 --> 23:39.518
when you were still in foster
care. She found that gun on you,

23:39.519 --> 23:42.451
and maybe you figured you'd
get revenge. It wasn't like that.

23:42.452 --> 23:46.424
You fled the scene in her
car. I didn't kill her. Okay?

23:46.425 --> 23:49.458
When she busted me, I
never wanted to see her again.

23:49.459 --> 23:53.832
But she kept coming to juvie to
check on me, week after week.

23:53.833 --> 23:57.205
Finally I asked her, "why don't
you leave me the hell alone?"

23:57.206 --> 23:59.007
You know what she said?

23:59.008 --> 24:02.040
She said a lot of people had
failed me, but she never would.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.543
She'd be there to
help when I got out.

24:04.544 --> 24:08.176
She was the first person to
ever really come through for me,

24:08.177 --> 24:10.118
and now she's dead.

24:10.119 --> 24:11.920
(People speaking indistinctly)

24:11.921 --> 24:15.484
Elena rented that motel
room for you, didn't she?

24:15.485 --> 24:18.787
Yeah. She said she'd
float me till I got a job.

24:18.788 --> 24:20.458
(Sniffles)

24:20.459 --> 24:23.191
What happened in the motel
yesterday morning, Sean?

24:23.192 --> 24:25.964
Ms. Rosas showed me the room.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.196
She gave me a key.

24:28.197 --> 24:31.199
Then she had to go to work.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.202
I was tired. I turned on the
TV, fell asleep on the bed.

24:34.203 --> 24:36.875
For how long?

24:36.876 --> 24:39.908
A couple hours,
till she came back.

24:39.909 --> 24:42.551
Checking on me again, I guess.

24:42.552 --> 24:45.083
I heard her open
the door. I got up.

24:45.084 --> 24:48.216
I bent down to pick
my shirt up off the chair,

24:48.217 --> 24:50.488
and then boom... a shot.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.490
Coming from where? I don't know.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.764
(Crying) I didn't even know
I was hit until I stood up.

24:55.765 --> 24:57.796
And then I saw her...

24:57.797 --> 25:01.530
Okay, if you didn't
shoot Elena, why run?

25:01.531 --> 25:03.271
(Continues crying)

25:03.272 --> 25:06.034
Who's gonna believe me?

25:06.035 --> 25:07.536
You?

25:07.537 --> 25:11.880
(Woman) Excuse me. I
need to change that bandage.

25:11.881 --> 25:14.984
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

25:17.647 --> 25:19.918
That is some infection.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.850
You have culturette swabs here?

25:21.851 --> 25:23.892
Yeah. Get me four swabs, please.

25:23.893 --> 25:27.856
He didn't see the
shooter... In a 15x20 room.

25:27.857 --> 25:30.198
You really think he
shot himself in the neck

25:30.199 --> 25:33.201
and then killed Elena? I've
seen weirder. You read his file.

25:33.202 --> 25:36.164
That kid's had a rough go.
You don't come back from that

25:36.165 --> 25:38.206
after just one helping hand.

25:38.207 --> 25:40.709
Elena sounds more like a force
of nature than a helping hand.

25:40.710 --> 25:43.071
(Peter) Okay, so
if he did kill her,

25:43.072 --> 25:45.073
then why didn't he keep
running, huh? (Beeping)

25:45.074 --> 25:47.545
I mean, why was he
at that wrecking yard,

25:47.546 --> 25:49.648
only five miles away
from the crime scene?

25:49.649 --> 25:52.320
Maybe that wasn't a coincidence.

25:52.321 --> 25:53.952
(Rock music playing)

25:53.953 --> 25:55.754
(Cell phone rings)

25:55.755 --> 25:57.155
Sean?

25:57.156 --> 25:59.157
Hello? (Turns down volume)

25:59.158 --> 26:01.660
Who is this?

26:01.661 --> 26:04.793
Philly p.D. And you are?

26:04.794 --> 26:07.265
Vincent stone.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.797
What do you want?

26:08.798 --> 26:11.970
To know why Sean wilcox
called your number six times

26:11.971 --> 26:14.603
the past day alone. He
in some kind of trouble?

26:14.604 --> 26:18.206
I don't know. You're the one
who spoke to him. You tell us.

26:18.207 --> 26:21.249
Of course I talked to him.
I'm like a father figure to Sean.

26:21.250 --> 26:24.282
Only constant he's had in his life. Well,
considering he's now a murder suspect,

26:24.283 --> 26:27.285
that doesn't speak very
highly of you, does it? Murder?

26:27.286 --> 26:30.218
Are you familiar with Elena
rosas? Never heard of her.

26:30.219 --> 26:32.961
Whoa. Let's try that again.

26:32.962 --> 26:35.093
You got blue dye on your neck.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.625
You know what's funny?

26:36.626 --> 26:40.298
Our murder victim had the
same thing on her finger. So?

26:40.299 --> 26:43.331
So the new pepper sprays
are infused with colored dyes,

26:43.332 --> 26:46.004
makes it easier to
identify attackers.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.236
You know Elena rosas now?

26:48.237 --> 26:51.039
(Train clattering)

26:51.040 --> 26:52.310
(Sighs)

26:52.311 --> 26:55.914
Fine. I met the
broad two days ago,

26:55.915 --> 26:58.747
but only 'cause she
came here looking for me,

26:58.748 --> 27:01.289
trying to tell me to
stay away from Sean.

27:01.290 --> 27:04.292
So you got violent, she defended
herself? Violent? No. Pissed? Yeah.

27:04.293 --> 27:06.294
Told her to get the
hell off my property.

27:06.295 --> 27:08.296
She wouldn't leave, and
when I grabbed her arm,

27:08.297 --> 27:10.198
she sprayed that
crap all over me.

27:10.199 --> 27:13.231
Now why would Elena tell
you to stay away from Sean

27:13.232 --> 27:17.305
unless you were part of
his troubles in the first place?

27:17.306 --> 27:19.207
That gun...

27:19.208 --> 27:22.270
That Elena found on
Sean didn't belong to him.

27:22.271 --> 27:25.874
It belonged to you, didn't it? Elena
got a call right before she was killed,

27:25.875 --> 27:28.146
from a pay phone
two blocks from here.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.679
Oh, you didn't want that
call traced because that was

27:30.680 --> 27:34.352
the call that sent Elena
hurrying back to the motel

27:34.353 --> 27:37.185
to take care of Sean, and
that's when you killed her.

27:37.186 --> 27:39.227
That's a really good story.

27:39.228 --> 27:41.730
Why don't you come back
when you have some proof,

27:41.731 --> 27:43.231
all right?

27:43.232 --> 27:45.234
I'm going back to work.

27:48.938 --> 27:51.199
(Clicks pen)

27:51.200 --> 27:53.171
(Clicks)

27:53.172 --> 27:56.445
(Gas hissing)

28:00.309 --> 28:02.881
Hey. What are you doing?

28:02.882 --> 28:05.283
A bullet grazed
one of our suspects,

28:05.284 --> 28:07.285
and the wound showed
an advanced infection.

28:07.286 --> 28:10.058
I sent a swab to microbiology

28:10.059 --> 28:12.260
for a culture and sensitivities

28:12.261 --> 28:14.723
and a culture for
fungus and a.F.B.,

28:14.724 --> 28:17.996
but I'm also doing
my own gram's stain.

28:17.997 --> 28:21.069
Ah. To see what infected
it. Do you mind if I...

28:21.070 --> 28:23.272
No.

28:25.234 --> 28:27.075
So...

28:27.076 --> 28:29.137
(Gloves squeaking)

28:29.138 --> 28:32.310
You like James Bond,
right? James Bond?

28:32.311 --> 28:35.313
What, are you kidding? You
want a little wine with that cheese?

28:35.314 --> 28:37.185
No, thank you.

28:37.186 --> 28:38.847
(Gloves snap)

28:38.848 --> 28:40.348
(Sets bottle down)

28:40.349 --> 28:43.151
I mean, unless you
like James Bond.

28:43.152 --> 28:44.453
(Slide clinks)

28:47.156 --> 28:49.958
You like to cook.

28:49.959 --> 28:51.329
What's your specialty?

28:51.330 --> 28:53.401
Uh... i... I'm not following.

28:53.402 --> 28:55.965
I-I don't... i don't cook.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.768
(Slide scrapes)

29:02.141 --> 29:04.212
You don't go extreme camping?

29:04.213 --> 29:07.215
I don't even know what that is.
Well, then what the hell do you like?

29:07.216 --> 29:09.347
Um, I don't... I'm
sorry. I don't know.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.149
I'm... i like...

29:11.150 --> 29:13.882
I like this, the job,

29:13.883 --> 29:16.825
the science.

29:16.826 --> 29:18.287
(Mouths words)

29:21.330 --> 29:22.491
Hey.

29:24.233 --> 29:25.864
I do, too.

29:25.865 --> 29:26.966
Yeah.

29:28.838 --> 29:31.299
Do you see the
India ink anywhere...

29:31.300 --> 29:33.272
Eagle eye?

29:45.454 --> 29:49.187
Ha ha ha ha!

29:49.188 --> 29:51.189
Check that out!

29:51.190 --> 29:53.091
Wow. What is that?

29:53.092 --> 29:56.524
Sean wilcox had a fungal
infection in his wound...

29:56.525 --> 30:00.498
Cryptococcus
neoformans, to be exact.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.200
(Cell phone rings)

30:02.201 --> 30:03.231
Morris.

30:03.232 --> 30:05.934
Where are you?
Back at the motel.

30:05.935 --> 30:09.237
If we can put Vincent stone in the
room, we got him. Sean wilcox got infected

30:09.238 --> 30:11.940
with a cryptococcus
neoformans fungus.

30:11.941 --> 30:15.383
You get it by being
near pigeon droppings.

30:15.384 --> 30:17.846
Uh, the dried feces
can become airborne,

30:17.847 --> 30:20.318
contaminating
anything in its vicinity.

30:20.319 --> 30:24.392
I'm sure this has a point besides
utterly grossing me out. Don't you get it?

30:24.393 --> 30:27.225
The bullet transferred the
fungus onto Sean's skin.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.058
It must have passed through
something with the fungus on it

30:30.059 --> 30:32.031
before hitting him.

30:33.532 --> 30:38.236
Like a dirty window screen.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.538
(Gasps) Nice one, doctor.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.912
The shot didn't come
from inside the room...

30:43.913 --> 30:48.217
Because the shooter
was standingoutside.

30:59.228 --> 31:02.160
Let's do a little
role-playing here.

31:02.161 --> 31:05.363
If we believe Sean wilcox,
he was asleep on the bed.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.295
(Bed rattles) Oh!

31:07.296 --> 31:09.337
Remind me to boil myself later.

31:09.338 --> 31:12.640
All right, so Elena
came in here.

31:12.641 --> 31:14.072
Uh-huh.

31:14.073 --> 31:17.976
All right, and she fell
here, which means...

31:17.977 --> 31:20.178
She was standing about here.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.410
All right? So Sean gets up,

31:22.411 --> 31:25.383
he grabs his shirt... Boom. The
bullet flies through the screen,

31:25.384 --> 31:28.086
grazes my neck, and sails
right into your arm. Right.

31:28.087 --> 31:31.359
Too late? Oh, no, you're right on
time. You see that hole in the screen?

31:31.360 --> 31:34.562
Uhh! Don't touch it unless
you want bird poop disease.

31:34.563 --> 31:38.497
You're the shooter.
Line up with us.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.507
Got it.

31:49.508 --> 31:53.211
The shooter was
standing right about here.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.583
Casing ejects back,

31:55.584 --> 31:57.385
to the right...

31:57.386 --> 32:01.449
Truck here.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.192
Voilà.

32:05.654 --> 32:07.655
(Grunts)

32:07.656 --> 32:11.429
Our killer left a .32
caliber casing behind.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.562
Breech marks can tie the
casing back to the gun that fired it.

32:14.563 --> 32:17.235
One thing... We
don't have the gun.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.367
I thought you said
that Vincent stone was

32:19.368 --> 32:22.510
behind Sean's weapon
possessions charge. Well, my hunch

32:22.511 --> 32:24.512
and a bullet casing
do not a warrant make.

32:24.513 --> 32:26.514
And I don't see
stone inviting us

32:26.515 --> 32:28.576
to search his property for guns.

32:28.577 --> 32:31.349
I know one person who
may be ready to help us.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.351
(Keys jangle)

32:33.352 --> 32:35.383
(Handcuffs click)

32:35.384 --> 32:38.486
Officer, may I have
a minute, please?

32:38.487 --> 32:40.189
(Keys jangle)

32:42.191 --> 32:44.332
Sean, we've become
aware of a few things

32:44.333 --> 32:46.964
since we last spoke.
Did you know that Elena

32:46.965 --> 32:50.138
confronted Vincent
on your behalf? What?

32:50.139 --> 32:52.200
She blasted him
with pepper spray,

32:52.201 --> 32:55.373
told him to leave you
alone because she knew

32:55.374 --> 32:58.676
that you used to work for him. Doing
what, Sean? I don't want to talk about it.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.749
You know, Vincent doesn't
have a record, but he's no Saint.

33:01.750 --> 33:05.383
He lets guys like you
do his dirty work for him...

33:05.384 --> 33:08.016
Selling guns,
moving stolen cars.

33:08.017 --> 33:10.488
That's why you ran back
to him after the murder...

33:10.489 --> 33:14.162
Because it's what you
know. Sean, did you ever think

33:14.163 --> 33:17.766
that maybe that
was exactly his plan?

33:24.773 --> 33:26.734
Okay, I'm gonna tell you

33:26.735 --> 33:29.478
something that most
people don't know.

33:31.340 --> 33:34.312
I was a foster kid.

33:34.313 --> 33:39.016
Yeah, I bounced around for
a while, and then I got lucky.

33:39.017 --> 33:43.121
You know, I got... i got
adopted into a good home.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.653
Loving parents, three sisters...

33:45.654 --> 33:47.396
Instant family.

33:49.458 --> 33:54.063
But some of those
scars never fade, Sean.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.366
I know that you
think that Vincent

33:58.367 --> 34:00.368
may have been helping you out.

34:00.369 --> 34:01.769
When you got nothing,

34:01.770 --> 34:04.312
any hand that reaches
out to you in the darkness

34:04.313 --> 34:06.314
seems like it's worth
grabbing hold of.

34:06.315 --> 34:08.416
I know that.

34:08.417 --> 34:12.250
But Vincent is a bad guy.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.282
Okay? And Elena knew it,

34:14.283 --> 34:18.226
and she put her life on
the line, helping you out,

34:18.227 --> 34:21.790
and that may have
gotten her killed.

34:24.393 --> 34:27.335
So what...

35:39.638 --> 35:42.410
Just a guy. It's
still pretty new.

35:42.411 --> 35:44.512
Well, good luck.

35:44.513 --> 35:45.913
(Sighs) Thanks.

35:45.914 --> 35:48.916
So you wanted to see me?
Yeah. I just wanted to say congrats

35:48.917 --> 35:51.449
on the cryptococcus finding.

35:51.450 --> 35:55.423
Yeah, it's nice when pigeon crap can serve a useful
purpose. (Chuckles) Yeah, that's an understatement.

35:55.424 --> 35:59.387
They seized over a hundred guns from Vincent
stone's property. Is one of them the murder weapon?

35:59.388 --> 36:02.460
We don't know yet. They
still have to test-fire all the .32s

36:02.461 --> 36:04.662
to match the casing
to the gun that fired it.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.735
And it would have been
helpful if there'd been a print

36:07.736 --> 36:10.738
or some d.N.A. On the
casing, but there's no such luck.

36:10.739 --> 36:13.441
The only thing trace
analysis found was...

36:13.442 --> 36:17.545
Rice flour, of all things.
Rice flour? Can I see that?

36:17.546 --> 36:20.408
What? What is it?

36:20.409 --> 36:22.710
They can fire all the
weapons they want,

36:22.711 --> 36:25.513
but they're wasting their time.

36:25.514 --> 36:27.586
Vincent didn't do it.

36:38.527 --> 36:40.528
Let me get this straight.

36:40.529 --> 36:42.530
I've got four c.S.U.S
working overtime

36:42.531 --> 36:44.532
test-firing all of
Vincent stone's guns

36:44.533 --> 36:46.534
to prove he committed
murder, but instead,

36:46.535 --> 36:49.277
you want me to arrest
someone completely different

36:49.278 --> 36:51.479
based on flour? Uh,
rice flour, actually,

36:51.480 --> 36:53.281
fortified with
bifidobacterium infantis.

36:53.282 --> 36:55.913
It's a probiotic. Like the good
bacteria, in yogurt, it helps digestion.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.416
Well, he makes sensible
eating choices. Good for him.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.717
It's not for adults.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.420
It's for babies,
hence the "infantis."

37:02.421 --> 37:04.522
It's in baby cereal.

37:04.523 --> 37:08.225
Wait. The bullet casing had baby food on
it? The shooter had to have transferred it

37:08.226 --> 37:10.798
to the bullet when the
magazine was being loaded.

37:10.799 --> 37:14.402
Vincent stone doesn't have kids.
Right. But I know someone who does.

37:14.403 --> 37:16.404
(Creaks)

37:16.405 --> 37:19.307
Yes? Step outside,
please, Ms. Bennett.

37:19.308 --> 37:20.608
What is it?

37:20.609 --> 37:21.839
Jeremy.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.543
Excuse me. Where are
they going? Excuse me.

37:25.544 --> 37:29.277
You know why we're here.
You killed Elena rosas.

37:29.278 --> 37:31.849
What?! No! Why would
I do something like that?

37:31.850 --> 37:35.283
That's what we were wondering.
(Sam) When Elena came to your place

37:35.284 --> 37:37.555
three months ago and
found those drugs...

37:37.556 --> 37:39.757
I told you. Those were my
ex's. I didn't... i tested clean.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.759
But cocaine can clear the system

37:41.760 --> 37:44.532
a day after ingestion.
(Megan) Elena knew that.

37:44.533 --> 37:47.765
That'swhy she came here yesterday.
What, did she catch you using again,

37:47.766 --> 37:50.838
threaten to take your baby away from
you? What? You guys have it all wrong.

37:50.839 --> 37:53.801
Really? Anything a
mother puts in her body

37:53.802 --> 37:57.044
can end up in her
breast milk. So?

37:57.045 --> 38:00.708
So your baby spit up on Elena,
remember? You admitted it.

38:00.709 --> 38:03.351
I ran a tox screen.

38:03.352 --> 38:04.752
Your milk contained metabolites

38:04.753 --> 38:06.414
that are specific to cocaine.

38:06.415 --> 38:09.417
You passed the drug
to your kid. What? No.

38:09.418 --> 38:11.659
Every time a social
worker suspects drug use,

38:11.660 --> 38:14.021
a drug test is
automatically ordered.

38:14.022 --> 38:16.023
Elena was gonna
order one on you.

38:16.024 --> 38:19.026
No. No! And you knew that Elena
would keep you to that test, you knew

38:19.027 --> 38:22.029
that you'd fail and that
you'd lose your baby for good,

38:22.030 --> 38:24.432
so you followed
Elena to the motel.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.435

38:53.432 --> 38:56.904

cared about you and your child,

38:56.905 --> 38:59.537
and now you've lost them both.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.038

this. Please stop it.

of Elena rosas. She's everything I have!

39:11.349 --> 39:13.751

to remain silent.

39:13.752 --> 39:18.025

She's everything I have! Please. Tessa!

39:18.026 --> 39:19.958
(Speaking indistinctly) No.

39:26.895 --> 39:29.898
(Megan) I wanted to
be the one to tell you.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.573
Did her job have
something to do with it?

39:39.708 --> 39:41.879
You have any kids?

39:41.880 --> 39:44.812
Um, a daughter.

protect them from the world,

of all... Letting them go.

work was dangerous.

39:57.025 --> 40:00.027
My heart tightened every
time she left in the morning,

40:00.028 --> 40:03.972
but I-I couldn't stop her
from doing what she loved.

40:05.704 --> 40:08.436
Elena touched so many lives.

40:08.437 --> 40:10.438
I-I witnessed it myself.

40:10.439 --> 40:14.081

too young and... and too innocent

40:14.082 --> 40:16.584

40:16.585 --> 40:19.587
what she did will
