What now?

00:21.760 --> 00:23.000
Come here, look.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.480
I'm doing
my history assignment.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.280
Hey, true history
happenin' right here.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.720
What are you lookin' at?

00:27.760 --> 00:29.120
Satellite.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.520
Nah, nah, nah.
Come here. Look.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.800
What?

00:41.560 --> 00:44.760
There. Look there.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.440
See? But look wider.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.320
See that dark emu?

00:50.680 --> 00:54.320
Don't look at the stars. Look at
the dark space around the star.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.320
There. You see him?

00:57.360 --> 00:59.400
He's beautiful.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.760
Our mob have been lookin'
at that for 80,000 years.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.040
Hey, you know what,

01:08.080 --> 01:10.880
some white fella comes along
and calls it negative space.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.520
Nah.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.800
Nothin' negative about that.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.480
Nothin' negative
about being dark.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.120
Hey, you know what
they should call it?

01:22.440 --> 01:24.760
Tyson Walker space.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.400
Ask me why.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.880
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm dark and deadly.

- There? See, you're laughin'.</i>

01:31.080 --> 01:32.520

Hey, look out.
She finally calls me Dad.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.720
Thank you, daughter.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.560
Oh, that bloody sucker got me!

01:44.640 --> 01:46.920
You're the one that got
too close to his fangs.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.120
Yeah, I'm the one that
staked him good too, OK?

01:49.160 --> 01:51.320
- Where were you?
- You told me to stay back.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.680
You sure it's not
a firebite?

01:54.720 --> 01:56.680
Neeks, don't even say that.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.240
Do you know what to do
with a firebite?

02:01.760 --> 02:03.960
I'm not talkin' about a scratch
like this here, bub.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.600
I'm talkin' about a firebite
that turns you into a sucker.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.080
Alright? Hurts like hell.

02:10.120 --> 02:13.040
Your blood's boilin',
you're lost forever.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.440
I never want that
to happen to me. You hear me?

02:17.400 --> 02:20.280
I never want that to happen
to me. I'd rather die.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.760
So you don't hesitate,

02:22.800 --> 02:25.280
you don't ask any questions,
you don't muck around.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.440
Stake straight through
the heart.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.920
Even if it's me, bub.

02:29.960 --> 02:34.360
Hero's life, Neeks. You've gotta
make those tough decisions.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.920
You get me?

02:36.880 --> 02:40.080
Kill a firebite fast.
I got it.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.760
Yeah.

02:41.800 --> 02:45.160
See, you're like me -
dark and deadly.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.400
Here. Pound it.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.120
- No.
- Come on!

02:49.160 --> 02:50.520
- Nuh.
- Pound it!

02:52.960 --> 02:54.240
Dolphin!

02:54.280 --> 02:55.960
Yeah.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.800
Hey. Shh, shh.
It's alright.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.160
It's alright. Shhh!

03:08.200 --> 03:10.680
Shh, shh.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.680
I'm here. I know.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.720
Listen...
Listen to my voice, alright?

03:14.760 --> 03:16.960
You trust me,
you trust my voice.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
The darkness is going through
your veins like fire

03:20.040 --> 03:22.960
and it is burning up
your humanity and your memories,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.840
and it hurts now, but it
will not last forever, OK?

03:26.880 --> 03:28.280
Don't fight it.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.800
Those memories will come back
in a few years,

03:30.840 --> 03:32.720
so no need to fight it now.

03:32.760 --> 03:36.640
Alright? You can trust me.
I'm gonna take care of you.

03:36.680 --> 03:37.720
It's alright. Shhh.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.240

I could salvage.

If I'm gonna stay,
I need to know.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.720
He got a firebite. That's
what the old fellas call it.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.600

10:54.200 --> 10:55.760
No.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.720
So...what do we do?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.520
Shanika's taking care of it.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.040
Poor bastard.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.720
He's gonna be wanting his own
people's blood for eternity.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.840
Loved that dickhead.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.160
He knew.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.320
He went thinkin'
every woman in town loved him.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.680
You stay...

11:25.640 --> 11:27.200
..you fight.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.560
That's right.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.960
Ahhh! Ahh.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.720
This place is empty.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.760
Lots of space.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.520
Think of what you could do and
build. Colony for the taking.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.160
You wanna see my fangs, Lucas?!

13:08.920 --> 13:09.960
Boo!

13:11.400 --> 13:15.360
You want others to do the hard,
dirty work, don't you? Hmm?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.520
And then when things go bad,

13:17.560 --> 13:19.400
you can't be accused
of any wrongdoing.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.640
That falls on others,
doesn't it?

13:22.680 --> 13:25.160
Some people would
call that cowardly.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.760
You're right, Eleona.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.240
A colony would never follow me.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.280
They follow power.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.080
And they've seen yours.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.320
But they'll never follow
a vampire that doesn't kill.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.360
Of course they won't.
You're pathetic.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.600
Oh, Matthew.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.560
Just leave it. Leave us!

13:51.600 --> 13:54.920
I'll leave you, but I'm not
leaving here without him.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.520
You tainted our bloodline
by turning a black.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.320
Oh, of all the ignorant things!

14:01.360 --> 14:04.400
You bow down
to this whore, Lucas?

14:04.440 --> 14:07.120
The King will have
both your heads.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.640
I don't see him around.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.440
I'll find him...

14:12.400 --> 14:13.960
..and restore him.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.560
Pathetic!
You don't even hide it anymore!

14:27.680 --> 14:29.440
Go! Lucas, get him!

14:30.520 --> 14:32.400
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's alright.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.840
We'll keep coming
until you kill the dog.

16:53.560 --> 16:57.360
That's some healing blood
you have there, Shanika.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.800
I'm doin' the talking.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.880
You came here
on the first ships.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.920
One of the first eleven.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.880
Who sent you?

17:22.160 --> 17:24.800
Kings of distant lands.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.760
Why'd you come?

17:26.800 --> 17:30.280
The empire enticed us
with black blood.

17:30.320 --> 17:33.200
You suckers need to
learn your place.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.920
We are superior in every way.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.360
You're just food.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.440
And you're just a disease.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.120
Then why am I alive?

17:45.520 --> 17:47.040
Eleona.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.640
She's taken Tyson...and...

17:54.440 --> 17:56.080
She turned him?

17:58.760 --> 18:00.760
Where will she have gone?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.480
Nah.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.360
Chains off first,
then I'll tell you.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.800
You'll kill me.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.440
I won't.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.680
You have my word.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.480
We want the same thing, Shanika.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.160
<i></i>

18:33.560 --> 18:35.440
You realise
you have no time.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.640
Right this second,

18:38.680 --> 18:41.520
he's losing his human self,
his identity,

18:41.560 --> 18:43.400
his memories, everything.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.200
If he lives long enough,
his memories will return.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.240
But that's if
he lives that long.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.000
Soon he won't even
know your name.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.520
Or his.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.160
How long's it take?

18:58.200 --> 19:02.280
Some can hold it for a few
days, a week, even, but...

19:04.680 --> 19:06.280
..depends on their strength

19:06.320 --> 19:08.440
and I don't think
he's got much of it.
