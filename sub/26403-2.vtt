00:07.087 --> 00:10.137
Hey, Jill, can you picture
the far wall down here?

00:10.140 --> 00:11.240
Is there a,

00:11.243 --> 00:13.243
maybe, like, a door?

00:13.246 --> 00:16.694
I don't get it. I don't
remember any door here.

00:19.633 --> 00:21.332
Did the trick.

00:21.334 --> 00:23.183
This whole deal with your basement is,

00:23.186 --> 00:24.602
is fascinating.

00:24.604 --> 00:28.640
Do you believe that some
things are just special?

00:30.931 --> 00:33.465
I just made up this
contortionist clown guy,

00:33.468 --> 00:35.445
Pretzel Jack.

00:35.448 --> 00:36.648
Who is that woman?

00:36.650 --> 00:37.891
Her name's Sarah Winters.

00:37.894 --> 00:39.846
We redid their master bedroom.

00:39.849 --> 00:41.452
Did you sleep with her or something?

00:41.454 --> 00:43.421
- I'm not your father.
- Hello?

00:44.157 --> 00:45.757
I called Sarah Winters.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.798
You were involved with this woman?

00:47.801 --> 00:49.327
I thought we were done with this.

00:49.329 --> 00:51.896
Why do I feel so fucking
sure something's going on?

00:51.899 --> 00:54.565
You came here with your
mind already made up.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.561 --> 01:56.761
Yes, I'm sure.

01:56.763 --> 01:59.397
You don't know this man.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.867
I don't know him. No.

02:02.902 --> 02:05.336
You can't give us any specifics?

02:05.338 --> 02:08.106
How many times does she have
to answer the same question?

02:11.344 --> 02:13.344
She already said she was in shock.

02:17.217 --> 02:19.417
What were you doing at Jason's?

02:21.254 --> 02:23.855
I just dropped by to say hey.

02:26.291 --> 02:27.591
He's our friend.

02:27.594 --> 02:29.527
He's your friend I thought.

02:30.597 --> 02:32.296
I didn't know that you guys were close.

02:34.234 --> 02:36.134
Okay, you know, I'm sorry.

02:37.203 --> 02:39.337
Is she under suspicion here?

02:39.339 --> 02:41.239
I mean, do we need to get a lawyer?

02:41.241 --> 02:44.542
A neighbor saw a man covered in blood.

02:44.544 --> 02:48.379
Said he had some kind of
white mask or makeup on.

02:48.381 --> 02:50.581
I think you know who he is.

02:51.584 --> 02:54.552
And I'm really curious

02:54.554 --> 02:56.254
why he didn't hurt you.

02:57.523 --> 03:00.791
Um... think we're done.

03:57.350 --> 03:59.217
Hey.

04:00.353 --> 04:02.286
You okay?

04:03.857 --> 04:06.791
Yeah. Yeah, I'm...

04:11.264 --> 04:13.264
That was just our pug.

04:13.266 --> 04:14.632
Pug.

04:15.635 --> 04:17.635
Dogs are the emperors.

04:17.637 --> 04:19.136
What?

04:19.137 --> 04:20.524
The wrinkles on their forehead.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.910
It makes the Chinese
character for prince.

04:23.929 --> 04:25.962
And a group of them is called a grumble.

04:27.247 --> 04:29.779
I was thinking, you
know, maybe we should get

04:29.782 --> 04:31.582
some sort of, like, a neighborhood watch

04:31.585 --> 04:33.417
type situation going on.

04:33.419 --> 04:35.386
Yeah?

04:35.388 --> 04:37.288
I just heard what happened.

04:38.157 --> 04:40.491
Sorry.

04:40.501 --> 04:43.335
I can't imagine seeing
something like that.

04:44.514 --> 04:46.314
I don't even like to watch it, you know,

04:46.317 --> 04:49.433
violence on TV or anything.

04:50.837 --> 04:52.603
What did he look like?

04:55.174 --> 04:56.874
Um...

04:57.890 --> 04:59.770
I couldn't really see.

04:59.773 --> 05:01.879
You ever try lucid dreaming?

05:01.882 --> 05:05.082
You can train your mind

05:05.084 --> 05:07.985
to control your subconscious.

05:07.987 --> 05:10.621
You can fast forward, rewind.

05:10.623 --> 05:12.590
Sometimes the answer's...

05:12.592 --> 05:14.525
already up in your head.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.366
I'm...

05:23.369 --> 05:25.503
I'm gonna take off.

05:25.505 --> 05:26.971
You have a good night, yeah?

05:26.973 --> 05:28.873
Take care of yourself.

06:32.838 --> 06:37.007
Do you believe in
things we can't explain?

06:37.009 --> 06:38.842
What do you mean?

06:38.844 --> 06:40.878
Like ghosts?

06:40.880 --> 06:43.614
Life after death?

06:43.616 --> 06:45.282
Or just...

06:45.284 --> 06:47.418
things that can't be explained.

06:50.022 --> 06:52.323
No.

06:53.926 --> 06:56.927
No, I don't believe
in supernatural shit.

06:59.465 --> 07:02.149
Nothing sticks around

07:02.152 --> 07:04.184
after this.

07:07.607 --> 07:09.573
People exist.

07:11.510 --> 07:13.344
Then they don't.

08:59.051 --> 09:01.719
- Hi.
- Hello.

09:01.721 --> 09:03.106
Hi, I'm Jillian.

09:03.109 --> 09:04.555
Jillian Hodgson.

09:06.068 --> 09:08.068
I used to be Jillian Hope.

09:09.175 --> 09:10.942
My mother and I, we...

09:10.945 --> 09:13.262
My God.

09:14.233 --> 09:15.666
You lived here.

09:15.668 --> 09:18.736
I met you when you were this high.

09:18.738 --> 09:20.960
Was that 20 years ago?

09:20.963 --> 09:23.331
I raised my own daughters since then.

09:23.334 --> 09:26.168
I just moved back here not too long ago.

09:26.738 --> 09:28.409
I was just in the neighborhood

09:28.412 --> 09:30.045
and I was wondering if...

09:30.048 --> 09:31.948
Come in.

09:31.950 --> 09:34.084
Thanks.

09:34.086 --> 09:36.153
All happy memories here.

09:37.322 --> 09:38.989
For the most part.

09:38.991 --> 09:41.725
Can't be perfect.

09:41.727 --> 09:44.127
Your dad, is he the same Bill Hope

09:44.129 --> 09:46.607
that does the neighborhoods?
Willow Courts and all that?

09:46.610 --> 09:48.198
You see the signs around.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.367
Yeah, that's... that's him.

09:51.737 --> 09:53.937
Not a lot of willows
in those photos though.

09:53.939 --> 09:56.173
Well...

09:56.175 --> 09:58.375
they stopped work on that one I think.

10:00.279 --> 10:02.078
Good.

10:06.752 --> 10:08.318
Do you like Matcha?

10:08.320 --> 10:09.953
I drink five cups a day.

10:11.223 --> 10:14.925
I'm afraid to Google and
see if that's healthy or not.

10:17.896 --> 10:20.897
Would you mind if I took
a look at my old room?

10:23.035 --> 10:24.434
That would be my daughter.

10:24.436 --> 10:26.803
- One sec.
- Sure.

10:30.809 --> 10:33.310
Hi, Pam.

10:34.666 --> 10:36.968
How are you doing?

10:39.266 --> 10:41.117
That's great.

11:39.197 --> 11:41.178
Jillian, where are you?

11:41.181 --> 11:42.979
I was just going to the restroom.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.253
Okay, I'll see you guys on Saturday.

12:05.256 --> 12:07.983
Okay, bye. Hi.

12:07.985 --> 12:10.385
Hi, bubsy, yeah.

12:14.155 --> 12:15.654
What is that?

12:37.848 --> 12:40.349
You're a good baby.

14:45.409 --> 14:47.442
You doing okay?

14:57.988 --> 14:59.488
Hey...

15:01.560 --> 15:03.593
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

15:05.831 --> 15:07.864
It's gonna be okay.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.080
What are you thinking?

15:35.760 --> 15:37.293
Jill...

15:37.295 --> 15:38.795
talk to me.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.337
Why did you go to his house that night?

16:03.021 --> 16:05.054
Are you upset?

16:06.691 --> 16:08.758
No, it's...

16:08.760 --> 16:11.427
it's just the cops said it
seemed like you weren't...

16:11.429 --> 16:13.463
saying something.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.900
Um...

16:18.036 --> 16:21.004
You know, I'm... I'm not
really sure what to think.

17:43.085 --> 17:44.985
Tom. Tom, he's upstairs.

17:44.988 --> 17:46.421
It's in the bathroom! I don't know.

17:46.424 --> 17:47.990
He was staring at me.

17:50.077 --> 17:51.743
Who?

17:51.746 --> 17:53.779
He's looking right at me!

17:57.301 --> 17:59.335
Stay back.

19:10.141 --> 19:12.632
So what exactly do you mean by

19:12.635 --> 19:14.101
became real?

19:15.055 --> 19:17.088
I know how it sounds,

19:17.090 --> 19:18.323
but that's what I mean.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.325
He became real.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.027
Well, let's talk about that.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.096
So I made him up as a kid.

19:25.098 --> 19:28.166
I drew these little stories about him.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.903
And then when I was
eight, when my dad left,

19:32.906 --> 19:35.497
he came out of a door
in the back of my closet.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.676
Not in my imagination.

19:37.678 --> 19:39.310
In reality.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.913
So let's talk about what.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.783
Pretzel Jack represents.

19:44.785 --> 19:48.534
When your father left
this figure became real.

19:48.537 --> 19:51.427
And losing Jason made
you think about him again.

19:51.430 --> 19:53.391
So do you think that this figure

19:53.393 --> 19:55.446
feels more real to you

19:55.449 --> 19:56.928
when you're in distress?

19:56.930 --> 19:58.363
You're not accepting my premise.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.699
I just want to steer you back

20:00.701 --> 20:02.167
to talking about this.

20:02.169 --> 20:04.178
Well, I want to talk about Pretzel Jack.

20:04.181 --> 20:05.236
It's related.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.403
All right, now our time really is up.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.007
If you want to make an
appointment to see me...

20:09.009 --> 20:10.220
You're not listening to me.

20:10.223 --> 20:12.793
This week, we can maybe
do tomorrow or Friday.

20:12.796 --> 20:15.197
But I'm going to suggest...

20:15.200 --> 20:16.548
listen.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.084
Xanax...

20:18.087 --> 20:20.150
for the day and Ambien for sleep.

20:20.153 --> 20:22.547
You know, no. No. Fucking forget it. No.

20:22.550 --> 20:25.256
Listen, redirecting your
distress into anger...

20:25.258 --> 20:26.891
I'm not redirecting, okay?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.259
And I don't need prescriptions.

20:28.262 --> 20:29.750
I need someone to
listen to what I'm saying

20:29.752 --> 20:31.135
which is what I'm paying you for.

20:31.138 --> 20:32.063
I am listening...

20:32.066 --> 20:33.260
No, you know what? Fuck this.

20:33.263 --> 20:34.667
- I'm out. I'm done.
- Jillian, if you would just

20:34.669 --> 20:36.535
reconsider, I'm... I'm...

21:05.599 --> 21:07.432
Hey.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.000
Hey there.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.307
Sup?

21:17.913 --> 21:19.279
I wanted to maybe talk about

21:19.282 --> 21:22.146
this neighborhood watch situation.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.115
And say thanks.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.161
- For what?
- Just...

21:26.164 --> 21:28.831
being nice the other day and listening.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.924
You try lucid dreaming?

21:32.926 --> 21:34.893
Not yet.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.397
Hey, you... wanna...

21:39.399 --> 21:41.866
kombucha or something?

21:43.503 --> 21:45.136
Sure.

21:46.940 --> 21:48.506
You study this?

21:48.508 --> 21:51.042
Yeah, yeah, I learned
Portuguese last year.

21:51.045 --> 21:54.477
It's a warm culture, so they...

21:54.480 --> 21:57.115
they have more words about intimacy.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.284
Like there's a word

21:59.286 --> 22:00.985
for the tender scratching

22:00.987 --> 22:02.186
of a lover's head.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.422
- Really?
- Cafuné.

22:09.362 --> 22:12.463
I always wanted to learn more languages.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.365
I always felt like I had

22:14.367 --> 22:16.200
so much going on inside my head

22:16.202 --> 22:17.902
and I never...

22:17.904 --> 22:19.837
had enough words to explain it.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.242
I guess that's kind of how
I'm feeling again these days.

22:28.982 --> 22:30.616
Forgive me if I'm being too forward,

22:30.619 --> 22:32.116
but...

22:32.118 --> 22:33.918
does that maybe have

22:33.920 --> 22:36.457
something to do with
your door situation?

22:38.391 --> 22:40.158
You can tell me.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.460
Um...

22:42.462 --> 22:44.529
I don't know if I can.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.564
It sounds crazy.

22:46.566 --> 22:49.534
Well, I promise I won't
call the men in white coats.

22:51.905 --> 22:53.071
Here.

22:53.073 --> 22:54.939
Try me.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.956
Um...

23:04.959 --> 23:07.484
This person

23:07.487 --> 23:09.354
or...

23:09.356 --> 23:13.358
thing that came out of our basement.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.561
That's what killed our friend, Jason.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.029
I saw it.

23:19.933 --> 23:22.300
Somehow I...

23:22.302 --> 23:24.527
I think I created him

23:24.530 --> 23:26.730
or invited him

23:26.733 --> 23:29.073
maybe.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.375
I made him up when I was a kid,

23:30.377 --> 23:32.510
and then...

23:32.513 --> 23:35.461
when my family was going
through a really bad time

23:35.464 --> 23:38.316
this figure appeared.

23:41.254 --> 23:44.488
You're sure it was the same figure?

23:45.758 --> 23:47.167
He's...

23:47.170 --> 23:49.037
pretty distinctive.

23:49.849 --> 23:51.882
He's a contortionist clown.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.266
Contortionist clown.

23:55.268 --> 23:57.134
Yeah.

23:57.136 --> 24:00.037
The laughing shadow.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.505
- What?
- The clown.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.541
The clown. Lives only in the present.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.476
He doesn't understand past or future.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.197
He's a...

24:07.200 --> 24:10.001
He's a healer, a guardian.

24:10.004 --> 24:12.216
Wait, so... so if...

24:12.218 --> 24:14.895
Pretzel Jack attacked your friend,

24:14.898 --> 24:16.287
I mean, why would he do that?

24:16.289 --> 24:17.488
Was he...

24:17.490 --> 24:19.940
trying to protect you from him, or?

24:19.943 --> 24:23.037
We had gotten into this
huge fight about Tom and...

24:24.497 --> 24:27.465
Well, the details don't matter, but...

24:27.467 --> 24:29.500
it just...

24:29.502 --> 24:31.669
Sometimes I feel like
no one is listening.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.018
And...

24:33.021 --> 24:34.521
I feel like I'm trapped

24:34.524 --> 24:37.352
and there's this
frustration and anger and...

24:37.355 --> 24:40.044
So you were angry at your friend.

24:41.310 --> 24:45.045
And then he got killed by Pretzel Jack.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.552
Yeah.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.622
Is there anyone else
that you might've...

24:52.625 --> 24:55.230
gotten angry with recently?

24:59.098 --> 25:00.626
Shit.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.300
What?

25:02.302 --> 25:04.568
I need to go see my therapist.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.679
Are you okay?

25:17.283 --> 25:18.749
Are you?

25:18.751 --> 25:20.451
What's going on?

25:20.453 --> 25:22.987
Sorry, she... She thought
she left something.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.422
Are... are you Tom?

26:12.860 --> 26:15.429
You shouldn't have gone
to see the baby like that.

26:15.431 --> 26:16.687
You crossed a boundary.

26:18.501 --> 26:21.002
So can you talk to her?

26:28.185 --> 26:30.919
I don't think what Sarah
is doing to you is right.

26:32.414 --> 26:34.114
But...

26:34.117 --> 26:36.951
if she's trying to protect her family...

26:37.750 --> 26:40.269
It's not really my
place to disrupt that.

26:41.954 --> 26:43.253
Tom.

26:54.778 --> 26:57.145
This is a safe place.

26:57.148 --> 26:58.981
You know that, right?

27:01.211 --> 27:03.578
There is...

27:03.580 --> 27:06.347
an ocean inside of you.

27:09.018 --> 27:11.519
And you can rest at the bottom.

27:14.556 --> 27:17.123
Find the silence there.

27:17.126 --> 27:19.160
Use the silence.

27:21.064 --> 27:24.065
You and only you are the author

27:24.067 --> 27:25.900
of your own reality.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.874
He looks just like me.

27:36.412 --> 27:38.079
I know.

27:42.919 --> 27:44.552
Come on.

27:44.554 --> 27:45.853
Yeah.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.372
Find your silence.

29:08.171 --> 29:10.137
I'm going to feed my fish.

30:45.013 --> 30:46.858
Guess Tom's not home.

30:47.816 --> 30:49.409
Maybe that's good.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.118
You know, after that little excursion

30:51.120 --> 30:54.020
I wouldn't mind
finishing our conversation

30:54.022 --> 30:55.689
if you want.

30:55.691 --> 30:57.391
Yeah.

30:57.393 --> 31:00.060
You know, I was thinking. It's funny.

31:00.062 --> 31:02.195
It didn't occur to me at first, but...

31:02.197 --> 31:03.897
you weren't the only
kid who had to invent

31:03.899 --> 31:05.832
a sidekick slash guardian.

31:05.834 --> 31:06.967
Yeah?

31:06.969 --> 31:09.169
Yeah, when I was a kid I was...

31:09.171 --> 31:11.598
kind of a weird little runt, I guess.

31:11.601 --> 31:14.608
And I was an only child. I hated my mom.

31:14.610 --> 31:17.844
Spent all my time alone drawing and...

31:17.846 --> 31:21.114
I drew myself a friend, right?

31:21.116 --> 31:23.617
He was this... he was like a kid.

31:23.619 --> 31:24.818
He was super tall.

31:24.820 --> 31:26.135
He was, like, taller than any adult.

31:26.137 --> 31:27.888
He had this big, scary face

31:27.890 --> 31:29.723
so nobody would mess with him.

31:29.725 --> 31:31.520
He was my best friend,
like, in the world.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.627
Just like your pretzel guy.

31:33.629 --> 31:34.861
What was his name?

31:34.863 --> 31:37.764
Yeah, I called him Tall Boy.

31:37.766 --> 31:39.625
- Tall Boy?
- 'Cause he was tall.

31:40.512 --> 31:42.358
My crayons were also my friends, though.

31:42.361 --> 31:43.970
- Your crayons?
- Yeah.

31:43.972 --> 31:46.521
My crayons were like my crew.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.911
Crayons, like Crayola Crayons?

31:50.913 --> 31:53.246
I mean, I was like four, so.

32:00.055 --> 32:02.155
You mind if I ask you a question?

32:02.157 --> 32:03.418
Yeah, go ahead.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.820
Do...

32:04.823 --> 32:08.060
you and your husband. Do
you fight with him a lot?

32:08.063 --> 32:09.963
No.

32:11.667 --> 32:14.475
I mean, all couples fight.

32:14.478 --> 32:16.592
We have some things
we have to figure out,

32:16.595 --> 32:18.420
but it's just part of being married.

32:19.207 --> 32:20.773
Yeah.

32:20.776 --> 32:22.976
Is it?

32:22.978 --> 32:26.112
I mean, at a certain point you

32:26.114 --> 32:29.002
realize you can't solve
all your problems with sex.

32:29.005 --> 32:30.805
Yeah.

32:30.808 --> 32:32.018
I don't know

32:32.020 --> 32:33.604
shit about marriage, I guess.

32:35.390 --> 32:37.257
Are you an only child?

32:37.259 --> 32:39.025
Yeah, I was.

32:39.027 --> 32:41.228
You know, I am too.

32:41.230 --> 32:42.796
Only children,

32:42.798 --> 32:44.731
scientifically more imaginative.

32:46.018 --> 32:48.118
Especially those with
unreliable fathers.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.281
Someone told you about my dad.

32:56.944 --> 32:58.777
I mean,

32:58.780 --> 33:00.241
he's got signs all over the place.

33:00.244 --> 33:02.507
He's still around here building

33:02.510 --> 33:04.284
subdivisions and stuff, right?

33:05.471 --> 33:07.838
Yeah, so I've heard.

33:08.790 --> 33:10.390
You don't talk to him?

33:11.901 --> 33:13.367
No.

33:14.229 --> 33:17.964
- He made his choice.
- What choice?

33:17.966 --> 33:19.766
To leave?

33:21.243 --> 33:25.667
Well, imagine my father's situation.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.942
On one hand you have your family.

33:28.944 --> 33:31.644
The woman you married,
the daughter you took

33:31.647 --> 33:33.814
to soccer practice every weekend.

33:37.552 --> 33:40.053
And then on the other hand you have

33:40.055 --> 33:41.988
your other family.

33:43.328 --> 33:44.892
The one that you've been hiding

33:44.895 --> 33:47.103
from the first family
for the last ten years.

33:52.367 --> 33:54.300
I'm sorry. I-I-

33:56.571 --> 33:58.538
I didn't, um...

33:58.540 --> 34:00.473
I should go home.

34:02.210 --> 34:03.977
- Yeah.
- Thanks for this.

34:03.979 --> 34:07.313
Okay. Yeah. Anytime. Anytime.

34:07.315 --> 34:09.382
I'll see you around, yeah.

34:09.384 --> 34:12.319
Yeah, yeah, hey, have a good night.

34:12.322 --> 34:14.286
You too.

36:16.623 --> 36:18.390
Hey, Tom!

36:19.359 --> 36:21.526
Tom!

36:21.528 --> 36:24.529
Tom, I know you're there
I can hear you breathing.

36:24.531 --> 36:27.198
I Know that was you at
the playground yesterday.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.668
If you ever come near
me and my family again

36:29.670 --> 36:31.336
I'll call the police!

36:31.338 --> 36:33.383
Stay away from me and my family!

36:33.473 --> 36:37.142
Stay away from me and my family!
