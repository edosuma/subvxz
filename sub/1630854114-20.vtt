WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:07.450
Mmm. First time I tried egusi,
I could barely stand the spice.

00:07.650 --> 00:10.090
Now look. (coughs)

00:10.290 --> 00:11.890
That's allergies.

00:12.090 --> 00:13.660
Can I have some more pepper,
please?

00:13.860 --> 00:14.890
Show off.

00:15.090 --> 00:16.360
You may have the pepper

00:16.560 --> 00:19.070
if you answer
the following history question.

00:19.270 --> 00:20.470
Don't tell me.
It's finals week.

00:20.670 --> 00:21.700
Best week of the year.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.370
What kind of kid looks forward

00:23.570 --> 00:24.770
to taking a bunch of tests?

00:24.970 --> 00:26.840
The genius
who fell out of my womb.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.010
(chuckles)

00:28.210 --> 00:29.940
Who fought
the Thirty Years' War?

00:30.140 --> 00:33.080
Catholics and Protestants
in Central Europe.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.010
Hold on, I am googling.

00:35.210 --> 00:37.730
Correct. Enjoy the pepper.

00:38.930 --> 00:40.250
You know,
I was talking to a client today,

00:40.450 --> 00:42.090
Southern Michigan man like me.

00:42.290 --> 00:43.610
Go Jackrabbits!

00:44.440 --> 00:45.960
Why is he screaming?

00:46.160 --> 00:46.960
It is something he does

00:47.160 --> 00:48.460
with the other alumni.

00:48.660 --> 00:50.360
I've seen it happen
in grocery stores.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.700
I can't wait for college.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.670
SMU was the best time
of my life.

00:53.870 --> 00:55.170
I should take you for a visit.

00:55.370 --> 00:56.440
It's only a couple hours.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.640
Why would you do that?

00:57.840 --> 00:59.140
Dele is going to Harvard.

00:59.340 --> 01:00.170
Yes.
Obviously.

01:00.370 --> 01:01.910
What an odd suggestion.

01:02.110 --> 01:04.880
So he can't even look
at other schools?

01:05.080 --> 01:05.840
No.
Why?

01:06.040 --> 01:07.910
What a ridiculous question.

01:08.110 --> 01:11.770
My counsellor did say we should
be touring a variety of schools.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.320
Which is not something
I need to do.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.020
I'm not trying to steal him
from Harvard.

01:17.220 --> 01:18.390
It'd be a fun trip.

01:18.590 --> 01:19.860
We can hit the road,

01:20.060 --> 01:21.730
sing the fight song of
the mighty Jackrabbits.

01:21.930 --> 01:24.500
* We gotta hop, hop, hop
for Southern Michigan *

01:24.700 --> 01:25.600
* The great school where *

01:25.800 --> 01:27.350
* The Great Lakes begin! *

01:29.080 --> 01:31.500
I can see why people
might find that annoying,

01:31.700 --> 01:33.010
but I love it.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.810
Come on, it can be a reward
for acing his final.

01:36.010 --> 01:38.240
I do not give rewards
for something I expect.

01:38.440 --> 01:39.510
AUTIE OLU:
Abishola,

01:39.710 --> 01:40.910
sometimes you just have

01:41.110 --> 01:42.980
to let your husband have
a pointless adventure.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.880
Even if it is just
to shut him up.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.420
Okay, let's not
everybody help at once.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.140
Pass me that pepper.

01:50.910 --> 01:54.940
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

02:17.700 --> 02:18.980
The old man in 402

02:19.180 --> 02:20.950
is annoyingly energetic today.

02:21.150 --> 02:22.460
He got a new pacemaker.

02:22.660 --> 02:25.490
Well, then somebody needs
to dial down the pace.

02:25.690 --> 02:27.730
(phone buzzing)

02:27.930 --> 02:29.260
Ugh.

02:29.460 --> 02:30.630
You okay?

02:30.830 --> 02:34.100
Bob is sending me notable alumni
from his university.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.240
Oh. From speaking with him,

02:36.440 --> 02:38.800
I never got the impression
he went to college.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.970
Along with a local accident
attorney named Fender Ben.

02:42.170 --> 02:43.240
KEMI:
Uh-uh.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.040
"Fender Ben,
your bent fender friend"?

02:46.250 --> 02:47.310
I love him.

02:47.510 --> 02:50.020
Bob insists that
Dele will benefit

02:50.220 --> 02:52.080
from seeing
his old stomping grounds.

02:52.290 --> 02:53.890
Wanting to share
precious memories

02:54.090 --> 02:55.390
with his loved ones.

02:55.590 --> 02:56.620
The nerve.

02:56.820 --> 02:57.920
What next?

02:58.120 --> 02:59.120
Is he going to take you
to the preschool

02:59.330 --> 03:00.980
where he was toilet-trained?

03:01.780 --> 03:03.130
GLORIA:
You do realize

03:03.330 --> 03:05.880
those elite universities
don't take everyone, right?

03:06.780 --> 03:09.500
So, you believe Dele is
too stupid to get into Harvard?

03:09.700 --> 03:10.970
No, I'm just saying,

03:11.170 --> 03:13.170
there are a lot of Deles
out there competing to get in.

03:13.370 --> 03:15.710
But my Dele is the best Dele.

03:15.910 --> 03:19.510
(scoffs) It never hurts
to have a backup plan.

03:19.710 --> 03:22.500
Why do you continue
to call him an idiot?

03:23.830 --> 03:25.200
Never mind.

03:26.070 --> 03:27.320
You know what?

03:27.520 --> 03:30.220
You should take him
to Bob's silly campus.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.490
Why would I do that?

03:31.690 --> 03:34.090
Threatening Dele
with a terrible education

03:34.290 --> 03:36.660
will shock him
into working harder.

03:36.860 --> 03:38.800
Oh, come on, now.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.670
The horrors of mediocrity

03:40.870 --> 03:44.020
will scare Dele
straight into the Ivy Leagues.

03:46.090 --> 03:48.290
Thank you, Kemi.

03:49.460 --> 03:53.300
And that is what supporting
a friend looks like.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.950
Are we ready to begin?
Real quick.

03:59.150 --> 04:01.550
I'm gonna be gone for a bit,
'cause for the first time,

04:01.750 --> 04:03.590
I won an argument
in my marriage.

04:03.790 --> 04:04.960
Aw.
Oh.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.430
So, she threw you out?

04:06.630 --> 04:08.260
Abishola and I are
gonna take Dele

04:08.460 --> 04:10.730
on a little road trip
to visit my alma mater.

04:10.930 --> 04:13.300
Oh! I would love to return to

04:13.500 --> 04:16.790
(in accent):
the Universidade NOVA de Lisboa.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.560
I did not know
you studied abroad.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.210
She went to Portugal
for two weeks

04:21.410 --> 04:23.260
and spoke with an accent
for a year.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.780
The mornings.

04:25.980 --> 04:29.180
(in accent):
A cup of cafÃ©
with my pastel de nata.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.950
In the evenings, we danced

04:31.150 --> 04:33.620
the fandango
alongside the Rio Tejo.

04:33.820 --> 04:36.090
(chuckles, sucks air)

04:36.290 --> 04:37.660
Are you done?

04:37.860 --> 04:39.940
<i>Prossiga.</i>

04:40.740 --> 04:43.500
While I'm away, I've brought in
some reinforcements.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.760
Mom!

04:44.960 --> 04:47.030
Look who we smuggled in
from Malaysia.

04:47.230 --> 04:50.190
She is kidding.
I flew Delta.

04:50.950 --> 04:52.810
Let's all give Wati
a warm MaxDot welcome.

04:53.010 --> 04:54.870
Hey, so good to see you,
Wati.
(others mumbling)

04:55.070 --> 04:56.410
WATI:
I am so excited.

04:56.610 --> 04:58.880
Now, when I put "Made
in America" on my products,

04:59.080 --> 05:01.010
I will not be lying.

05:01.210 --> 05:02.520
Welcome, Mr. Zhao.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.080
It is good
to have someone

05:04.280 --> 05:06.990
whose expertise
will compliment my own.

05:07.190 --> 05:08.390
Will this affect
the chain of command?

05:08.590 --> 05:10.020
Nope, you're still
at the bottom.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.290
Well, it's always nice

05:11.490 --> 05:13.890
to have diversity
in upper management.

05:14.090 --> 05:15.060
Thank you, Christina.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.600
So he is upper management?

05:17.800 --> 05:18.930
Guys, relax.

05:19.130 --> 05:20.730
Wati has always been
a part of this team.

05:20.930 --> 05:24.200
The company's growing,
so his role's growing, too.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.770
Hey, this is your first day
in America.

05:25.970 --> 05:27.010
I'll show you the town.

05:27.210 --> 05:28.770
Yeah, I want to
eat a chili dog

05:28.970 --> 05:30.210
and buy a gun.

05:30.410 --> 05:33.130
I know a place
where you can do both.

05:35.700 --> 05:40.470
Okay. What two countries did
Yugoslavia split into in 2003?

05:41.870 --> 05:43.120
Serbia and Montenegro.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.590
Correct.

05:44.790 --> 05:46.830
In 1989, what did
the Bennigan's

05:47.030 --> 05:50.100
near campus turn into?

05:50.300 --> 05:51.760
I do not think
he will get AP credits

05:51.960 --> 05:53.070
for the history of Bob.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.030
The answer is
Burger Palace.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.940
Best malt in Southern Michigan.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.870
You just said that about a diner
we passed 20 minutes ago.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.480
That was the best milkshake.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.440
Ah. The kid's a quick study.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.610
Well, here we are.
Welcome to the 'Zoo.

06:08.810 --> 06:11.700
That's what you call Kalamazoo
if you want to sound cool.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.390
Cool.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.390
Oh. There it is.
McConnell Hall.

06:16.590 --> 06:17.890
Freshman year dorm.

06:18.090 --> 06:20.840
Fun fact, built by a guy
who designed prisons.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.660
Do not worry, you're not going
to stay in the dorm.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.230
You will stay
with your second cousin.

06:25.430 --> 06:26.670
She only lives
an hour from Harvard.

06:26.870 --> 06:27.900
BOB:
Come on.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.200
He's got to get
the full experience.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.870
Meeting kids
from all over,

06:31.070 --> 06:34.340
learning to sleep three feet
from a total stranger.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.890
And the stranger's girlfriend.

06:37.860 --> 06:39.180
It's only an hour, you said?

06:39.380 --> 06:42.720
He's gonna fall behind.
What do you mean?

06:42.920 --> 06:45.250
People on campus are
at school 24/7.

06:45.450 --> 06:47.390
You have access to study groups.

06:47.590 --> 06:49.290
It's easier to get to
the professor's office.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.960
It's like living
in a lecture hall.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.430
That's interesting.

06:52.630 --> 06:53.890
You're damn right it is.

06:54.090 --> 06:55.160
If I wasn't in the dorms,

06:55.360 --> 06:56.460
I would've never
made the dean's list.

06:56.660 --> 06:57.960
You made the dean's list?

06:58.160 --> 06:59.770
At Southern Michigan University.

06:59.970 --> 07:00.870
Go Jackrabbits!

07:01.070 --> 07:02.520
(horn honking)

07:05.990 --> 07:08.210
And there is
Mr. Wheeler's office,

07:08.410 --> 07:09.840
which you can enter freely,

07:10.040 --> 07:12.880
thanks to the open-door
policy I suggested.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.880
I believe in closed doors.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.120
That is also a good policy.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.450
Hello!

07:19.650 --> 07:21.620
Welcome to our factory,

07:21.820 --> 07:23.240
my new friend.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.530
I have no idea who you are.

07:26.730 --> 07:31.000
Babatunde Olatunji.
MaxDot's senior consultant.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.470
That sounds made up.

07:32.670 --> 07:34.770
Well, Bob created the position
for me.

07:34.970 --> 07:36.230
So it is made up.

07:36.430 --> 07:37.670
No, it is real.

07:37.870 --> 07:40.310
He's a senior
and does a lot of consulting.

07:40.510 --> 07:43.660
I am also Bob's wife's uncle.

07:44.390 --> 07:45.710
Which is not
necessarily relevant.

07:45.910 --> 07:49.950
Of course it is.
That is why I got the job.

07:50.150 --> 07:51.350
Shall we continue your tour?

07:51.550 --> 07:53.190
No, thank you,
I have seen enough.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.370
(muttering)

07:57.370 --> 07:59.610
He seems nice.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.360
And this is the student union,

08:06.570 --> 08:08.600
home to WKMZ radio.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.540
I actually had
my own talk show.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.740
It's Bob Wheeler,
host of <i>The Morning 'Zoo.</i>

08:12.940 --> 08:14.370
How we feeling,
Jackrabbits?

08:14.570 --> 08:16.240
Let me guess.
It was a sports show.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.680
And current events.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.150
I broke the story
about the campus streaker.

08:20.350 --> 08:21.880
Were you the campus streaker?

08:22.080 --> 08:24.470
No, but I might have been the
guy who convinced him to do it.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.490
Is that whole building
for science?

08:26.690 --> 08:28.020
Yeah, and the one next to it.

08:28.220 --> 08:29.390
Spent a lot of time there.

08:29.590 --> 08:32.120
I thought you majored
in communications.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.730
With a minor
in meteorology.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.190
(in radio voice):
We got a storm front
pushing through.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.060
Bundle up, Jackrabbits.

08:37.260 --> 08:38.810
(normal voice):
I was gonna use the voice
one way or another.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.000
I like that girl's hoodie.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.270
Hoodie, huh?

08:43.470 --> 08:45.200
Let's check out
the campus store.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.710
We'll get you some swag.

08:46.910 --> 08:48.970
You know, that car of yours
would look real good

08:49.170 --> 08:50.780
with an SMU bumper sticker.

08:50.980 --> 08:53.950
But then in traffic
people will assume he goes here.

08:54.150 --> 08:57.550
God forbid anybody think
he went to my crappy school.

08:57.750 --> 08:58.980
Exactly.

08:59.180 --> 09:00.620
I am glad you had
a great time here,

09:00.820 --> 09:02.590
but this place is
not right for Dele.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.820
What if Harvard isn't
right for him?

09:05.020 --> 09:06.290
Don't be ridiculous.

09:06.490 --> 09:07.730
Harvard is right for everyone

09:07.930 --> 09:09.460
that is good enough to get in.

09:09.660 --> 09:10.960
That's elitist, you know that?

09:11.160 --> 09:11.960
Yes.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.770
That's not a good thing.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.100
Only for those
who are not elite.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.690
Oh, my God.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.910
Seems to be
a bike-friendly campus.

09:21.110 --> 09:22.070
That's nice.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.410
Dele needs to go
to the best schools

09:23.610 --> 09:24.540
to be successful.

09:24.740 --> 09:26.080
I went here and look at me.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.610
I'm a seven-time Undergarment
Distributor of the Year.

09:28.810 --> 09:31.150
Dele does not have
the same advantages you had.

09:31.350 --> 09:32.350
Hey, I paid my own way

09:32.550 --> 09:34.520
and busted my ass
the whole time.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.020
Look at this bench.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.160
"A gift of the class of 1980."

09:38.360 --> 09:39.460
Very generous.

09:39.660 --> 09:40.530
ABISHOLA: He needs
to go to a school

09:40.730 --> 09:42.330
that will open doors for him.

09:42.530 --> 09:44.460
This school opened doors for me.

09:44.660 --> 09:45.860
Yes, to your family's company.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.870
And there it is.
Let's just forget it.

09:48.070 --> 09:50.050
Come on, let's go.

09:51.220 --> 09:54.660
Just so you know,
the Unabomber went to Harvard.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.010
Theta Phi Zeta step.
OTHERS: Zeta step.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.400
(all grunt)

10:04.700 --> 10:05.850
Ah.

10:06.050 --> 10:07.750
Theta Phi.
OTHERS: Zeta.

10:07.950 --> 10:09.370
(all grunting rhythmically)

10:13.910 --> 10:15.660
Theta Phi.
OTHERS: Zeta.

10:15.860 --> 10:17.060
(all grunt)

10:17.260 --> 10:19.510
Yeah!
(scattered whoops)

10:22.750 --> 10:23.970
Thank you. That was so cool.

10:24.170 --> 10:26.050
Yeah, you can't have him.
He's going to Harvard.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.340
We should look at some of
these student organizations.

10:29.540 --> 10:31.240
Eh, you don't have to humor me.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.540
I think it would be
good for Dele

10:32.750 --> 10:34.950
to see some of the study
clubs he could join.

10:35.150 --> 10:37.250
I could join study clubs?
Awesome!

10:37.450 --> 10:39.450
Man, she did
a number on you.

10:39.650 --> 10:40.950
Hey, look at this.

10:41.150 --> 10:43.360
The Pan African
Students Association.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.660
"Open to any and all students
interested in issues

10:45.860 --> 10:48.890
that involve and affect
the African diaspora."

10:49.090 --> 10:50.400
An important club like that

10:50.600 --> 10:52.600
at an academic
cesspool like this?

10:52.800 --> 10:54.450
What are the chances?

10:55.520 --> 10:57.500
They have an engineering club.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.070
Oh, why don't you
check it out?

10:59.270 --> 11:00.370
See what they did wrong
to end up here.

11:00.570 --> 11:01.670
I'm gonna take Dele
to the library.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.130
Good idea.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.850
I think it's that way.

11:07.050 --> 11:08.150
College 101, kid.

11:08.350 --> 11:09.720
No matter where you are,
always tell your mom

11:09.920 --> 11:11.080
you were at the library.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.440
That's high school 101,
but okay.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.760
Goodwin.
Hello, Kofo.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.360
There is a shark among us.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.990
We need to form an alliance.

11:22.190 --> 11:23.330
I have made it very clear

11:23.530 --> 11:26.310
that my policy is:
"Every man for himself."

11:27.280 --> 11:28.370
Wati has it out for Uncle Tunde.

11:28.570 --> 11:30.900
I think his job is in trouble.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.300
Oh, no.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.120
What does Tunde do again?

11:35.190 --> 11:36.610
Tale as old as time,
you know?

11:36.810 --> 11:40.110
New guard comes in,
starts trimming the fat.

11:40.310 --> 11:41.510
I've seen it
everywhere I've worked.

11:41.710 --> 11:44.120
You've only ever had one job
besides here.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.980
Well, now I've seen it
both places.

11:46.180 --> 11:47.890
Wati is not our enemy.

11:48.090 --> 11:49.220
He is a resource.

11:49.420 --> 11:51.660
A rising tide
lifts all boats.

11:51.860 --> 11:54.530
You know, as someone who's
almost drowned in a wave pool,

11:54.730 --> 11:56.960
I am offended
by that saying.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.560
What do we do?
Is he going to fire everyone?

11:59.760 --> 12:02.800
Well, not everyone.
(chuckles)

12:03.000 --> 12:04.870
Wheeler. Wheeler.

12:05.070 --> 12:06.370
CHRISTINA:
It's not fair that

12:06.570 --> 12:09.310
the people who've worked
so hard for so many years

12:09.510 --> 12:11.080
are the ones on
the chopping block.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.880
I wish we could be chopped,
but again...

12:14.080 --> 12:15.710
Wheeler.
Wheeler.

12:15.910 --> 12:16.930
(whistle blows)

12:17.730 --> 12:19.990
That means the meeting
is starting.

12:20.190 --> 12:21.950
Two whistles means
we are done.

12:22.150 --> 12:25.770
I need to get a whistle.
Let's begin.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.180
(upbeat music playing faintly)
(lively chatter)

12:45.380 --> 12:46.280
What do you think?

12:46.480 --> 12:48.280
I'm in greasy heaven.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.450
It's soggier than I remember,

12:50.650 --> 12:52.080
but those memories
are a little hazy,

12:52.280 --> 12:54.350
if you know what I mean.
I do.

12:54.550 --> 12:55.740
Well, you shouldn't!

12:57.870 --> 13:00.090
I'm telling you, you're gonna be
a star in college.

13:00.290 --> 13:01.160
I hope so.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.230
I know so.

13:02.430 --> 13:03.560
You're smart, funny.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.100
People are gonna be lining up
to sit with you

13:05.300 --> 13:07.130
at one of these sticky tables.

13:07.330 --> 13:08.930
Were they like this
when you were here?

13:09.130 --> 13:11.490
Again, I don't quite remember.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.410
A lot of change coming.

13:14.610 --> 13:16.240
Yeah.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.440
You know what makes a hard thing
impossible?

13:19.640 --> 13:22.500
Not really wanting to do it
in the first place.

13:23.830 --> 13:24.780
Can I ask you something?

13:24.980 --> 13:26.730
Sure.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.250
Do you actually want to go
to Harvard?

13:29.450 --> 13:31.690
Uh, yeah, it's Harvard.

13:31.890 --> 13:32.990
All right,
I'm just checking,

13:33.190 --> 13:34.790
'cause it's your decision.

13:34.990 --> 13:37.030
College is where you're gonna
meet lifelong friends

13:37.230 --> 13:38.560
and make incredible memories,

13:38.760 --> 13:41.470
and I want you to be
as happy there as I was here.

13:41.670 --> 13:42.900
Thanks.

13:43.100 --> 13:46.550
I know you'll make the right
choices wherever you go.

13:46.990 --> 13:48.620
Which will be Harvard.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.480
Can I ask you something?

13:51.680 --> 13:53.080
You can always talk to me.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.910
Do you think this ID looks
real enough to get me into bars?

13:56.110 --> 13:57.480
Whoa.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.420
I thought we'd start with
"what are the best flip-flops

13:59.620 --> 14:01.450
to wear in the shower?"

14:01.650 --> 14:03.020
So...

14:03.220 --> 14:04.720
"Antonio."

14:04.920 --> 14:06.090
What's your birthday?

14:06.290 --> 14:08.130
July 6, 2004.

14:08.330 --> 14:09.630
You know that only
makes you 19, right?

14:09.830 --> 14:11.760
I don't plan to use it
until I'm in college.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.430
(scoffs) God bless you,

14:13.630 --> 14:15.820
you even break the law
like a nerd.

14:16.650 --> 14:17.740
No, rookie mistake here.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.170
You made the address
too complicated.

14:19.370 --> 14:20.440
You're never gonna
remember this.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.940
57344 Greenwind, Apartment 304.

14:24.140 --> 14:26.710
Grand Rapids, Michigan, 49502.

14:26.910 --> 14:28.910
This says Lansing.
No, it doesn't.

14:29.110 --> 14:31.500
You're good.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.150
Well, nice knowing you,
Antonio.
Hey.

14:34.350 --> 14:35.250
I thought you were cool.

14:35.450 --> 14:38.510
Me, too, bud. Me, too.

14:39.610 --> 14:42.460
Condoms! Condoms!

14:42.660 --> 14:44.700
Take a pamphlet,
get a free condom.

14:44.900 --> 14:48.230
So this school encourages
sexual debauchery.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.300
Safe sexual debauchery.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.100
You are an authority figure.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.640
You should be setting a better
example for your students.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.540
Actually, I'm a freshman.
Is it the glasses?

14:57.740 --> 15:00.300
No, you just look old.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.980
I'm Wendy.

15:03.180 --> 15:05.020
Abishola.

15:05.220 --> 15:07.690
I dropped out years ago
when the kids came along.

15:07.890 --> 15:10.620
Now is my chance to finally
go after my dream.

15:10.820 --> 15:12.520
Hmm.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.380
I recently decided
to become a doctor.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.400
I am going to Johns Hopkins.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.070
Well, ain't you fancy?

15:20.270 --> 15:22.370
Yes. I am.

15:22.570 --> 15:24.940
I can't imagine doing that
at our age.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.640
You are doing it.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.170
Here, where I've got
a scholarship and childcare

15:29.370 --> 15:30.640
to help with my youngest.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.240
At a cutthroat school
like Johns Hopkins,

15:32.440 --> 15:34.910
I'd pretty much be on my own.

15:35.110 --> 15:39.550
Adversity creates pressure,
and pressure makes diamonds.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.390
I don't need my soul crushed,

15:41.590 --> 15:43.520
but if it works for you,
that's great.

15:43.720 --> 15:44.790
It does.

15:44.990 --> 15:46.460
Can you take a pamphlet?

15:46.660 --> 15:49.830
I get an extra point in biochem
if I pawn off the whole stack.

15:50.030 --> 15:54.550
If you want a better grade,
you should study more.

15:57.050 --> 15:58.720
(sighs)

16:02.820 --> 16:05.630
Sure you don't want a condom?

16:06.790 --> 16:08.450
Well, once again
I'm leaving

16:08.650 --> 16:11.330
without a degree,
but this was fun.

16:12.370 --> 16:13.740
I really enjoyed the library.

16:15.340 --> 16:16.850
It smells like
you were researching

16:17.060 --> 16:17.990
in the pepperoni section.

16:18.190 --> 16:19.690
It was Bob's idea!

16:19.890 --> 16:20.990
If you want to get
invited to parties,

16:21.190 --> 16:23.230
we got to work on
that, right there.

16:23.430 --> 16:25.160
I am glad
you two enjoyed the day.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.530
BOB:
What about you?

16:26.730 --> 16:28.330
Did have fun
picking apart my alma mater?

16:28.530 --> 16:31.100
Hmm. It's actually
a lovely institution.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.200
For idiots.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.910
No, really.

16:34.110 --> 16:36.040
So, you could see Dele here?

16:36.240 --> 16:37.590
Of course not.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.780
But I could possibly go
to a place like this.

16:40.980 --> 16:44.680
If Johns Hopkins and
all the Ivy Leagues burned down.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.120
I knew the campus
would win you over.

16:47.320 --> 16:49.490
Was it the quad?
It was the quad.

16:49.690 --> 16:52.690
I had a nice conversation
with a 40-year-old freshman.

16:52.890 --> 16:54.160
And this is why we say:

16:54.360 --> 16:55.490
"Go Jackrabbits!"

16:55.690 --> 16:57.080
(horn honks)

16:57.850 --> 17:00.700
I hope this trip made you feel
more prepared for college.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.470
Definitely.
If a place like this seems cool,

17:03.670 --> 17:04.740
imagine what it's like

17:04.940 --> 17:06.100
at a school
that's actually good.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.520
Mm-hmm.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.060
Et tu, Antonio?

17:19.900 --> 17:21.190
Hello, Goodwin.

17:21.390 --> 17:23.990
You will address me
as President Olayiwola.

17:24.190 --> 17:26.560
I will stick with Goodwin.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.330
Just so you know,
I run the meetings,

17:29.530 --> 17:31.680
and I sit
at the end of the table.

17:32.810 --> 17:34.470
And when lunch
is brought in,

17:34.670 --> 17:37.100
I get my sandwich first.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.700
I am not here
to step on your toes.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.440
Bob has told me
many wonderful things about you.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.940
I see.

17:45.140 --> 17:47.350
You do not let feelings
cloud your decision-making.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.250
That is true.
I have heard

17:49.450 --> 17:50.750
inspiring stories about

17:50.950 --> 17:53.690
how you push the workers
to the brink of exhaustion.

17:53.890 --> 17:55.450
You're too kind.

17:55.650 --> 17:59.060
We Nigerians are not soft
when it comes to business.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.790
That is how it should be.

18:00.990 --> 18:01.960
It is...

18:02.160 --> 18:03.930
BOTH:
...all about the work.

18:04.130 --> 18:05.700
(laughter)

18:05.900 --> 18:09.930
I'm sure you agree
this place must be streamlined.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.340
I have told Mr. Wheeler this.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.340
Decisive action must be taken.

18:13.540 --> 18:15.040
It is like you are
reading my mind.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.540
We must cut
the dead weight.

18:17.740 --> 18:19.330
I see.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.110
Oh, let me know
if you need anything!

18:22.310 --> 18:24.450
My day is wide open!
