WEBVTT

00:13.314 --> 00:14.115
David?

00:20.254 --> 00:21.622
Oh, man.

00:21.655 --> 00:25.426
You're not gonna, like, read me
a poem or something, are you?

00:25.459 --> 00:26.294
DAVID: Darlene, help me.

00:33.601 --> 00:34.468
What are you doing here?

00:34.502 --> 00:35.836
It's, like, 2:00 in the morning.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.838
I've gotta talk to you.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.041
Is that what you sleep in?

00:41.075 --> 00:43.111
Well, my pasties and
g-string are in the wash.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.150
All right, look.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.119
I have something to say to
you, and it's really important

00:51.152 --> 00:52.486
that you don't interrupt me.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.388
Wait, let me guess.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.856
Darlene, you just
don't understand.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.057
It's different for boys.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.826
It's got to be now,
I tell you, now.

01:01.795 --> 01:02.830
My parents are
getting divorced.

01:05.633 --> 01:09.803
[sigh] My dad left this
morning with Lisa and Nicki.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.806
Mom wants us to move
back to Michigan.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.676
I don't want to leave you.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.679
So I think you and me
should go to New York now.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.214
I mean, if this is
too much of a rush,

01:20.248 --> 01:22.950
I can come back in
a couple of hours.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.419
Whoa, David, we
can't just leave.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.721
Hey, you're the one who
wanted to get out of Lanford.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.558
Well, that was after
we got into art school.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.160
- What's the difference?
- You're right.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.527
What was I thinking?

01:33.561 --> 01:35.963
We'll just show up to a New
York bus station with no money.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.965
Darlene, you hate it here.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.268
Give me one good
reason not to run away.

01:40.301 --> 01:44.172
Well, it'd make it a lot
harder to look down on Becky.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.074
At least she had the guts
to go off with my brother.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.210
You obviously don't
give a damn about me.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.179
(SARCASTICALLY) Ooh, I hope
you don't double-dog-dare me.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.781
Then, I'll have to go.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.015
Fine.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.818
I'll go to New York myself.

01:57.851 --> 02:02.156
I can't live with my mother,
not without my father there.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.056
What, so that's it?

02:03.090 --> 02:04.758
You're just leaving?

02:04.792 --> 02:05.893
What do you care?

02:05.926 --> 02:06.960
Hey, I care!

02:06.994 --> 02:08.162
No, you don't.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.129
Of course I do.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.332
I love you.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.166
Jerk.

02:17.037 --> 02:17.905
Really?

02:17.938 --> 02:18.806
Are you sure?

02:18.839 --> 02:21.542
Yeah, I'm sure you're a jerk.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.544
No I mean, not--

02:23.577 --> 02:25.979
wow.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.148
Why didn't you
ever say it before?

02:28.182 --> 02:28.982
Hoping it'd pass.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.456
So then, are we going or what?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.357
Wait a minute, David.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.125
This is, like, a big commitment.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.627
I mean, you're talking
about living together.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.331
We haven't even
slept together yet.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.699
Well.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.101
[theme music]

03:32.446 --> 03:35.349
Hey, can I talk to you?

03:35.383 --> 03:36.250
Sure.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.184
I'll try anything once.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.258
Uh, well, never mind.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.693
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what am I missing here?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.160
Oh, it's no big deal.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.262
We'll talk about it later.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.697
If you can talk about
it with your mother,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.965
you can talk about it with me.

03:51.999 --> 03:52.800
OK.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.409
I need more tampons.

04:16.056 --> 04:19.460
What do you think?

04:19.493 --> 04:22.930
I don't think that's it.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.298
All right.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.099
Well, if I was going to ask
you for something really big,

04:26.133 --> 04:28.402
you'd want me to just, like,
come out and say it, right?

04:28.436 --> 04:29.470
Well, I don't know.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.638
If you're going to
ask for something big,

04:30.671 --> 04:34.375
I might want to
see a dance first.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.644
Well, David's parents
are getting divorced,

04:36.677 --> 04:39.246
and he's supposed to move
to Michigan with his mom.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.850
And I was wondering,
can he move in with us?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.618
Darlene, if we're going
to say no to something big,

04:44.652 --> 04:46.219
you'd want us to come right
out and say it, right?

04:48.589 --> 04:49.523
Why not?

04:49.557 --> 04:50.658
I mean, he could
sleep on the couch,

04:50.691 --> 04:52.025
you know, get a
job and pitch in.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.527
And he wasn't
raised by you guys,

04:53.561 --> 04:54.828
so he's real well-behaved.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.400
I'm sorry, Darlene.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.168
The answer is no.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.636
You don't know how
much this means to me.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.872
I mean, David's the reason I
came out of my mood last year

05:04.905 --> 05:11.979
and stopped being so difficult.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.382
You stopped being difficult?

05:14.415 --> 05:15.883
Well, why didn't you tell us?

05:15.916 --> 05:18.051
We would've had a party.

05:18.085 --> 05:18.952
All right.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.954
But I'm a lot better than I was.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.490
And I mean, we're not
sleeping together,

05:22.523 --> 05:23.857
so you don't have
to worry about that.

05:23.891 --> 05:24.792
It's just that I love him.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.828
Stop looking at me.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.530
The fact that I'm sharing
my feelings with you when

05:29.563 --> 05:32.232
I'd rather gouge
my eyes out should

05:32.265 --> 05:35.335
prove that I'm being sincere.

05:35.369 --> 05:38.372
Well, what does David's
mother think of this?

05:38.406 --> 05:39.707
Mrs. Healy's for it.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.309
She's going to have a hard
enough time supporting herself.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.546
She also wants him to finish
high school with his friends.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.447
OK, Darlene.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.481
You've made your point.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.317
Now, me and your dad
will discuss this.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.020
All right.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.288
I just want to say that I know
that this is the sort of thing

05:55.322 --> 05:58.626
that typical parents
would object to.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.793
I've always thought
you guys were

05:59.827 --> 06:00.861
cooler than typical parents.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.433
No, seriously.

06:09.069 --> 06:09.870
Thank you.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.742
God bless you.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.777
How long should we pretend to
discuss this before we go out

06:16.810 --> 06:18.178
and tell her no?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.681
You've got to admire
her technique, though--

06:20.714 --> 06:24.117
that stuff with telling us how
cool we are and everything.

06:24.151 --> 06:28.088
And that stuff about
sharing her feelings-- man,

06:28.121 --> 06:32.860
that was reminiscent of
the great Becky Conner.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.595
This is her first
boyfriend, Rose.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.829
It's going to be really rough.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.466
I know that, Dan, but gee,
we can't fix everything.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.201
It would be nice to
fix one thing once.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.603
We just can't afford it.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.104
Besides, you never
know about kids.

06:44.137 --> 06:48.241
What if he starts demanding
things, like food?

06:48.275 --> 06:50.578
I can't believe his
mother is OK with this.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.781
I mean, do you think
she's cooler than us?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.382
Of course she's OK.
She's got the boy.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.585
It's the girl's parents
who do all the suffering.

06:57.618 --> 07:01.622
Well, I just cannot stand the
idea that in a couple of years,

07:01.655 --> 07:03.891
DJ will be out there,
making some other

07:03.924 --> 07:06.927
parent's life a living hell.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.361
Yeah.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.263
[laughter]

07:18.572 --> 07:19.773
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:19.807 --> 07:20.841
How was work?

07:20.874 --> 07:21.742
All right.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.843
We really nailed Mom.

07:22.876 --> 07:23.744
Cool.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.779
Did she cry?

07:25.813 --> 07:26.847
There's this guy.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.849
See, he's 70 or 80,
comes in every day.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.017
He orders the same thing.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.418
He never leaves a tip.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.622
So today, Roseanne wrote a note
to him from "Mom," that says,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.724
"I want your body."

07:36.757 --> 07:38.692
Not my Rosie.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.261
That's crazy talk!

07:41.294 --> 07:43.030
So this time,
when the guy leaves,

07:43.063 --> 07:44.698
he leaves Mom this huge tip.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.800
And on the way out, she
says, please come again.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.836
And he says, sure
thing, sweet cheeks,

07:48.869 --> 07:50.303
and slaps her on the butt.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.805
It was a hoot!

07:51.839 --> 07:53.273
[laughter]

07:53.306 --> 07:54.675
Good ol' Bev!

07:58.812 --> 07:59.947
ROSEANNE: Hey!
- Hey!

07:59.980 --> 08:02.282
How are you doing?
- Pretty good.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.652
The greatest thing in the
world happened with Mom today.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.619
Oh, boy.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.754
Oh, yeah?

08:06.787 --> 08:07.988
What happened?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.489
Well, there's this old
guy that comes in every day,

08:09.523 --> 08:10.758
you know.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.993
And he always orders the
same thing and he never, ever

08:13.026 --> 08:13.894
leaves a tip.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.529
Oh, man, is he asking for it.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.065
So I wrote him this
note today from Mom

08:18.098 --> 08:19.567
that says, I want your body.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.467
Ha!

08:20.500 --> 08:24.371
I can't wait to hear the end!

08:24.404 --> 08:27.941
Jackie already
told you, didn't she?

08:27.975 --> 08:29.242
Yeah, but I never
really understood--

08:29.276 --> 08:32.112
(YELLING) Jackie!

08:32.145 --> 08:34.948
Why, you told Dan my day again!

08:34.982 --> 08:36.684
One good thing happens,
and you have to come

08:36.717 --> 08:38.185
over and tell him before I can!

08:38.218 --> 08:40.420
It's my day, too, you know!

08:40.453 --> 08:41.655
That doesn't matter!

08:41.689 --> 08:43.323
He's my husband!

08:43.356 --> 08:45.058
I have been married
to him for 19 years!

08:45.092 --> 08:47.194
It is hard enough to think
of something to say to him!

08:52.432 --> 08:55.202
Well, what am I supposed
to talk to people about?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.571
We're together every
minute of the day!

08:57.605 --> 08:58.839
We have the same damn wife!

08:58.872 --> 09:05.913
[stomping loudly]

09:05.946 --> 09:09.082
Maybe this is a bad time.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.885
Nah, it's always like this.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.253
Hey, David.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.321
Why don't you guys sit down?

09:14.354 --> 09:15.555
We'll talk for a couple minutes.

09:15.589 --> 09:16.389
OK.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.863
Well, David, you know,
Dan and I really like you.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.900
We like you a lot more than
we like your brother, Mark.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.168
Probably than we
even like Darlene.

09:30.838 --> 09:34.274
But there's just no
way we can do this.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.709
This totally sucks.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.444
It's all right.

09:37.477 --> 09:40.648
I mean, you know, we totally
feel for your situation,

09:40.681 --> 09:43.817
but it's just, we don't
let anybody grow up here

09:43.851 --> 09:45.552
unless we're forced to by law.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.991
Don't worry about it.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.860
I have to go.
- Now, wait a minute.

09:52.893 --> 09:53.961
This isn't over.

09:53.994 --> 09:57.230
I'm really sorry, David.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.599
I'll talk to you
later, Darlene.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.102
Thank you for thinking
about it, Mrs. Conner.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.838
Bye-bye.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.340
You've no idea
what you've done.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.777
You don't think I know?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.411
What are the odds
of you bringing home

10:11.444 --> 10:13.413
another boy I'm going to like?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.883
Don't you care that I'm
never going to see him again?

10:15.916 --> 10:17.751
Oh, it's only a
couple of years.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.887
Michigan's not that far away.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.355
He's not going to Michigan.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.192
He's running away.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.161
Oh, he's not that stupid.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.763
Yeah, he is.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.665
You have no idea
how stupid he is.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.142
[doorbell buzzing]

10:42.175 --> 10:42.976
Coming!

10:47.014 --> 10:48.849
Uh, Barbara Healy?

10:48.882 --> 10:50.317
Yeah?

10:50.350 --> 10:52.820
Yeah, I'm Roseanne Conner.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.654
You know, a couple of
our kids are married,

10:54.688 --> 10:56.690
a couple of our kids are dating.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.091
Hi.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.492
Right.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.794
Darlene's not here.

11:00.828 --> 11:01.929
Yeah, I know.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.898
But I was at the grocery
store around the corner,

11:04.932 --> 11:06.399
and I knew where you guys lived.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.068
And I thought I
should come over,

11:08.101 --> 11:10.704
because I want to talk to you.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.872
Sure, what the hell?

11:16.209 --> 11:18.411
Well, maybe we would
have met at Becky

11:18.445 --> 11:22.349
and Mark's wedding if either
one of us had been invited.

11:22.382 --> 11:26.419
Yeah, well, maybe we'll
both be there for the divorce.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.755
Well, that'd be nice.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.525
Uh, listen.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.662
I want to talk to you
about David, you know.

11:38.799 --> 11:42.402
I think he might be
getting ready to run away.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.004
What, are you kidding me?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.773
No, and I feel really
responsible, too,

11:45.806 --> 11:48.776
because I know that you wanted
Dan and me to take him in.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.612
Take him in?

11:52.645 --> 11:55.248
I wanted you to take him in?

11:55.282 --> 11:57.684
What the hell are
you talking about?

11:57.717 --> 11:58.919
David!

11:58.952 --> 12:00.320
David!

12:00.353 --> 12:02.790
Oh, man, you didn't even know
anything about this, did you?

12:02.823 --> 12:05.125
Mrs. Conner.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.761
What is all this crap
about you running away?

12:07.795 --> 12:10.163
And who said it was OK with me
for you to move into her house?

12:10.197 --> 12:12.299
And don't lie to me!

12:12.332 --> 12:14.434
Oh, I'm not running away.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.403
Moving into her house
was just an idea.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.871
We didn't think it
would hurt to ask.

12:17.905 --> 12:22.609
So you're going to abandon
me, just like your father did?

12:22.642 --> 12:24.711
Mrs. Conner, could you
leave us alone, please?

12:24.744 --> 12:25.813
No.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.647
I want her to stay here
so you can tell her

12:27.680 --> 12:31.351
you're sorry for being such
a pathetic little liar.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.654
Hey, I don't mean to interfere
here, but you know, the kids--

12:34.687 --> 12:36.623
they just took a shot
at staying together.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.725
It's not like it's the
worst thing in the world.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.060
Oh, you don't think so?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.062
No, it's not even the worst
thing Darlene's done today.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.168
Listen to me.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.770
I don't want you
butting in, telling me

12:50.804 --> 12:52.572
how to raise my kids.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.641
Take a look at the two
little whores you raised.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.214
Oh.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.149
I'm in this now.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.993
You know, if your
kid wasn't here,

13:13.026 --> 13:15.695
I would take the
opportunity to remind you

13:15.728 --> 13:19.232
that people who live
in glass whore houses

13:19.266 --> 13:20.367
shouldn't throw stones.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.173
It's people like you that
give white trash a bad name.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.341
Mom, please just stop.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.043
It's over, OK?

13:30.077 --> 13:31.011
I'm not going anywhere.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.012
I promise.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.347
You think you could
live without me?

13:34.381 --> 13:35.883
You think you can
survive for two minutes

13:35.916 --> 13:38.151
out there in that world unless
I was taking care of you?

13:38.185 --> 13:39.352
You are worthless!

13:39.386 --> 13:40.921
You are a worthless
little bastard!

13:44.291 --> 13:45.158
OK.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.259
I'm changing my mind.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.594
David, you can come live
with us if you want.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.801
Are you trying
to steal my kid?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.737
This has nothing to do
with stealing anything.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.773
Whether he runs away or
comes and lives at my place,

14:00.807 --> 14:02.375
he is not going to
stay here with you.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.479
That's not true.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.482
Is it, honey?

14:09.516 --> 14:12.252
I want to live with them.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.988
Look, you know that I don't
mean it when I do this, baby.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.758
I just-- I'm going through
a tough time now, OK?

14:18.791 --> 14:19.960
I won't talk like that again.

14:19.993 --> 14:20.894
I'll never say it again.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.829
Don't you love me?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.164
I can't keep doing this.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.506
(YELLING) Get out now!

14:33.540 --> 14:34.341
(SCREAMING) Now!

14:37.677 --> 14:38.545
Come on, David.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.348
We'll get your stuff later.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.449
Let's go home.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.589
Well, it's a boy.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.464
You're moving in?

14:57.497 --> 14:58.932
How did this happen?

14:58.966 --> 15:02.202
Well, Darlene, it's
a real long story.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.671
But you both got
what you wanted, so

15:04.704 --> 15:07.174
welcome to our family, David.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.008
You're both grounded.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.812
Thanks, Mom.

15:12.845 --> 15:16.716
Roseanne, uh, can I talk
to you for a second, please?

15:16.749 --> 15:18.918
Why, Jackie, I'd
love to talk to you.

15:18.952 --> 15:22.055
We don't spend nearly
enough time together.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.724
Well, it's been quite a month.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.659
But I'm leaving.

15:26.693 --> 15:33.466
Here are my house keys-- front
door, back door, dead bolt.

15:33.500 --> 15:38.438
Jackie, you've had
those keys for nine years.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.272
It was symbolic.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.117
You know, it's natural to feel
a little jealous when we bring

15:50.150 --> 15:52.285
a new person into the house.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.921
(IN BABY TALK) But you
know, Dan and I-- we

15:54.954 --> 15:58.058
love you just as much as we
ever did, and you know what?

15:58.091 --> 15:59.559
You could be my little helper.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.299
I'm going to start packing.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.535
Until I find an apartment, I
will be at Mom's, which should

16:08.568 --> 16:10.170
tell you how desperate I am.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.009
Hey.

16:16.043 --> 16:16.843
Where have you been?

16:19.012 --> 16:23.550
Well, Dan, I wouldn't
ordinarily do this without you,

16:23.583 --> 16:26.386
but I went and had another kid.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.891
Is David out there?

16:31.924 --> 16:34.261
You mean, Dan Jr.?

16:34.294 --> 16:35.495
It's not funny, Roseanne.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.530
Oh, come on, it's
a little funny.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.598
No, Roseanne.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.500
No, we're not doing this.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.868
You told him he could live here.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.237
You can go back out there and
tell him you made a mistake.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.338
No.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.340
I'm sorry, Dan, but
I can't do that.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.976
Oh, so now, the kids
get whatever they want?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.212
Becky gets married, David
moves in with Darlene.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.013
Hey, why don't we let DJ
go on that all-sugar diet

16:54.047 --> 16:54.847
he's been pushing?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.687
Well, I didn't
do it for Darlene.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.624
She's the last person
I want to make happy.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.126
I did it for David.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.560
I couldn't leave him there.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.761
That's what you
said when we found

17:08.795 --> 17:10.530
that lost puppy in the highway.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.831
I don't want this to
wind up like that.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.266
I don't want to have
to put David to sleep.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.072
I saw what David
lives with, and I

17:19.106 --> 17:20.573
just couldn't leave him there.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.009
He deserves to move in
with a stable family.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.011
Gee, can I come, too?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.214
You don't understand, Dan.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.582
His mother is really messed up.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.484
That doesn't make the
kid our responsibility.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.954
No, I don't mean messed
up like we're messed up.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.689
I mean, bad.

17:36.723 --> 17:41.294
Really really, really
incredibly bad.

17:41.328 --> 17:45.031
I grew up in a house like that.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.433
That bad, huh?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.735
Yeah.

17:48.768 --> 17:49.702
Oh, man.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.605
[sigh]

17:52.639 --> 17:57.110
Well, you know, Dan,
I'll make this up to you.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.712
You're my husband,
and I love you,

17:59.746 --> 18:01.681
and I'm willing to throw
Jackie out for you.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.654
You'd do that for me?

18:10.957 --> 18:12.159
Consider it done.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.000
Oh, look, honey.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.237
Our kids are necking.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.407
So did you guys talk about it?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.308
Yeah.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.609
It's cool.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.378
Thank you, Mr. Conner.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.679
All right.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.214
Well, I guess I'll show you
your room in the basement.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.183
I don't think so.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.551
First of all, there will
be no holding hands.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.020
There will be no
looks across the room.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.423
There will be no touchy-feely,
there will be no hanky-panky,

18:43.456 --> 18:46.559
there will be no
smoochy-woochey.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.195
And there will be none of
that other stuff you're

18:48.228 --> 18:50.029
not supposed to know about.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.631
Can we still date?

18:51.664 --> 18:55.535
If you want, but I
don't see much point.

18:55.568 --> 18:59.339
And David, while you live
here, you'll be home by curfew.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.475
You will keep your room clean.

19:02.509 --> 19:06.579
You will be the child
we've never had.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.480
OK.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.748
That's fair.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.583
These are just
the rules today.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.018
We reserve the right
to change the rules

19:12.051 --> 19:15.121
at any time for your
safety, for your education,

19:15.154 --> 19:19.692
or for our amusement.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.729
That is the price of
living in our kingdom.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.397
Welcome to Roseanna-do.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.371
Mom, is David
gonna live here now?

19:31.404 --> 19:32.772
Yeah, DJ.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.442
Looks that way.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.510
Hey, you, just
because you're older

19:37.544 --> 19:40.046
doesn't mean you get
to boss me around.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.781
It's not how old you
are in this house,

19:41.814 --> 19:43.950
it's who's been here longer.

19:43.983 --> 19:47.086
And I've put in 12 years.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.255
Don't worry right, runt.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.489
David's not going
to boss you around.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.757
If he wants something,
he'll tell me,

19:50.790 --> 19:53.426
and I'll boss you around.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.094
OK, then.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.963
Now, what's for dinner?

19:56.996 --> 20:00.667
Well, in honor of
David's first night here,

20:00.700 --> 20:05.104
I'm going to do something
that I don't ordinarily do.

20:05.137 --> 20:08.641
I'm going to order
the pizza myself.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.042
We always get pizza.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.711
I want hamburgers.

20:11.744 --> 20:12.712
I'm with the lad.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.980
Hamburgers it is.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.248
We're getting pizza, Spock.

20:20.253 --> 20:23.723
Oh, well, David, it looks
like you're the tiebreaker.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.300
Uh, burger's good.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.403
My god, I can feel it.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.571
The hormonal balance in
this house has shifted.

20:43.510 --> 20:46.446
And the men are victorious!

20:46.479 --> 20:47.347
Come, men!

20:47.380 --> 20:51.050
Let us repair to
the living room.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.652
We shall watch "The
Three Stooges,"

20:52.685 --> 20:54.287
and we shall scratch ourselves.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.638
Pizza.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.474
[theme music]

21:21.814 --> 21:23.816
I had a really
great time tonight.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.018
Can we go out again tomorrow?

21:26.052 --> 21:26.919
I don't know.

21:26.953 --> 21:27.754
You may call.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.459
OK.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.827
I love you, Darlene.

21:34.861 --> 21:35.662
I love you, too.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.206
Good night.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.675
Night.
