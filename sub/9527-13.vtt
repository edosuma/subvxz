WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:02.669
I'm just saying that it's sexist

00:02.753 --> 00:04.671
-that I can show my nipples...
-Right.

00:04.755 --> 00:06.506
...but my little sister
can't show hers.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.634
That's crazy. It's just, like,
let women free the nip.

00:09.718 --> 00:10.677
Free the nipples.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.845
-How young is your sister?
-It doesn't matter.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.138
It's that you should just be able to do it.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.932
-Yeah, okay.
-This is America last time I checked.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.642
-Get off me!
-Okay, Bill...

00:17.726 --> 00:20.353
-Bill, would you hold her down?
-She's strong.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.606
-Oh, my gosh, she got mean strength.
-What's wrong with my brain?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.274
I don't know. I don't know.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.694
The devil is cursing me.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.415
I'll have what she's having.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.296
I'm fresh

00:47.381 --> 00:49.382
You gotta, you gotta
You gotta, gotta

00:49.466 --> 00:51.134
Gotta be fresh

00:55.097 --> 00:56.639
Does this look familiar?

00:56.724 --> 00:58.599
Yeah, that's a Samoa, right?

00:58.684 --> 01:01.728
Oh, did she go sugar mad?

01:01.812 --> 01:03.730
That's right. That's a real thing.
That happened to my aunt.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.982
She drove her Corolla off one of
the bridges in Madison County,

01:06.066 --> 01:08.985
and in the wreckage, they
found three Whatchamacallits.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.238
Candy wrappers.
Like Milky Way candy wrappers.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.991
Okay, this is a half-eaten,
giant weed cookie

01:15.075 --> 01:17.660
that Tina found in your cubicle!

01:17.745 --> 01:18.995
-It's... Which is stealing.
-Yes.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.038
-So you want us to fire her? 'Cause we'll do it.
-Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

01:21.123 --> 01:25.251
We are not firing the traumatized woman
who is now in the hospital

01:25.335 --> 01:28.087
because you three
brought drugs to work.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.422
Okay, she's a traumatized
thief, though.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.715
-Please, let me banish...
-Identity theft...

01:30.799 --> 01:32.550
-I want to banish someone.
-That's the word. The thief part.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.677
She is traumatized,
but she is a criminal.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.346
You guys, I'm really sorry
to have to do this,

01:37.431 --> 01:40.349
but you have gone
way too far this time.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.059
You're all fired.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.522
Well, it finally happened.

01:47.357 --> 01:51.486
No, no. She can't fire us
because we dem boys.

01:51.862 --> 01:56.532
A woman ran through a glass
door high on drugs, because of you three.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.493
I have to fire you.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.789
You know,
I didn't want to do this,

02:02.873 --> 02:04.457
because it would, you know,

02:04.541 --> 02:06.459
- feel a little icky to do.
Mmm-hmm.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.128
But I'm going to have
to pull out our one time only,

02:09.213 --> 02:11.547
"You can't fire us" card, Alice.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.424
Okay, what the hell are you talking about?

02:15.177 --> 02:18.888
Alice, need we remind you
how you got your job?

02:30.234 --> 02:31.901
--Yello.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.239
Hey, uh, what's up, player?
I'm Ice Holmvik.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.824
I'm here for an orientation.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.826
Oh, that's a,
that's an unusual name.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.829
What's the significance
to that, Ice?

02:42.913 --> 02:45.623
I used to swim,
but then I started rhyming,

02:45.707 --> 02:47.917
and my rhymes were so cold
that the water froze.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.044
Hence, Ice Holmvik.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.587
Oh, that's... I love... I love rap.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.549
I love rap, too.
I'm also into hip-hop fashion.

02:54.633 --> 02:55.633
-You know, like...
-Right.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.636
This guy, Kanye, is like, starting to really
come up and change the game,

02:58.720 --> 03:00.972
so I started a denim line.
Check that.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.724
It's called, Rawegian.
I don't really have them

03:03.809 --> 03:05.685
steady sagging right now,
but usually I do.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.187
But since I'm at work,
I pull them up out of respect.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.356
I appreciate that. I'll tell you what.

03:10.440 --> 03:15.403
If you wear slacks tomorrow,
I'll cut you some slack today.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.029
-That's what's up.
-All right, well,

03:17.114 --> 03:18.614
orientation's in about ten
minutes, conference room.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.074
-That's what's up.
-Thank you, buddy.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.409
-That's what's up.
-All right, Ice.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.785
This is gonna be fun, buddy.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.000
What the hell are you guys doing here?
You're supposed to be in class.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.042
You get it, bro.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.086
It's like a financial crisis
we're going through.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.463
-Yeah.
-Recession, college loans,

03:34.548 --> 03:36.132
-the bailouts...
-Bailouts, yep.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.551
So you know, we bailed out.
Barack Obama!

03:38.635 --> 03:42.555
-You dropped out of college?
-Yeah, as real bosses do.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.849
Bill Gates, the child from Facebook.

03:44.933 --> 03:49.854
Hey, guess what, guys.
It's Steve Jobs not Steve College.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.272
That's funny.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.232
'Cause I'm kind of gonna be the office
funny guy around here.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.609
I feel like that's my vibe.

03:54.693 --> 03:55.735
That's my calling. That's my truth.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.445
Okay, so should we clock
in or something?

03:57.529 --> 03:59.196
No, we definitely
shouldn't clock in, okay?

03:59.281 --> 04:00.489
I should clock in,
because this is my job

04:00.574 --> 04:01.616
and you don't belong here.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.618
This is where I am going
to turn over a new leaf

04:03.702 --> 04:06.746
and become the man I was
supposed to be, Ice Holmvik.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.664
I will not call you that.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.750
I will never, ever
call you Ice Holmvik.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.294
- This is... Yes, you will.
- Oh, Ders, check it out.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.254
-Ice is what I'm called.
-Yeah, but check it out.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.048
Dude, is that...
Is that Lacey Jams?

04:17.132 --> 04:19.008
-Yes, like, 100%. That's her.
-Don't look up. Don't look.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.217
Be cool. Be cool.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.678
Does that mean that
that dude right there is...

04:22.888 --> 04:24.138
The dude with the mole?
The mole man?

04:24.222 --> 04:26.349
If that's him, I bow to thee,

04:26.433 --> 04:28.434
because he's got
a huge sausage, right?

04:28.518 --> 04:30.144
And she derbs it all
the way up to this mole

04:30.228 --> 04:32.229
that he's got on the base.
I'm telling you.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.148
She's not thro' yet, but she's a prospect.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.484
She's like the Derrick Rose
of deep throat, dude.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.653
Oh, is that, like, an Internet thing?

04:38.737 --> 04:40.655
Ugh, yuck.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.783
Oh, Adam, you are still taking
a hard stance on the Internet.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.201
Dude, it is 2008.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.119
Don't be 2000-late, okay?

04:47.204 --> 04:49.830
The Internet and computers
are for dweebs and nerds.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.832
You got to get
on there, dude.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.292
It's, like, a lot
of amazing porno on there.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.752
-Yeah.
-This Internet porno fade...

04:54.836 --> 04:57.713
That's gonna... It's gonna fade
away because porno stars

04:57.798 --> 05:00.883
are on the covers of DVDs
and the covers of VHS tapes.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.927
Okay, cool dudes.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.137
I want all new recruits in
the conference room right now.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.847
Let's do this. Come on.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.683
Okay, thank you, everybody.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.142
Now, please, enjoy this fun,

05:10.227 --> 05:11.894
little video that we put
together that tells you

05:11.979 --> 05:14.021
absolutely everything
you need to know.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.652
- I didn't see it.
- No, no...

05:19.736 --> 05:21.028
- Didn't see it.
- Hog is hidden, hidden hog.

05:21.113 --> 05:24.991
TelAmeriCorp is a pretty rad place
to work if you just stick to the rules.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.868
-Rule number one, be on time.
-Okay, we got nothing.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.578
I think his pants are too loose.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.746
That's a good thing. That's a good thing.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.666
-How is it a good thing?
-Because if he shakes his butt...

05:34.960 --> 05:36.085
Then you know
his dick's wagging.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.378
-Yes, yes.
-Okay, okay, I'm with you.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.046
I got this. I got this. Yo, dude. Hey, hey.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.172
Dude, there's like...

05:40.257 --> 05:41.841
-There's a scorpion on your butt.
-What?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.092
Yes, a little, baby
scorpion on your butt.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.927
Yeah, on the other side.
You got to shake your butt.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.430
- Yeah, careful. Yep.
- Shake your butt. Shake it off.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.514
Mmm-mmm.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.057
Harder? Shake it harder.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.018
Oh, still clinging. It's really...

05:52.102 --> 05:55.479
Hey, guys, let's please show
some respect to the business world.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.940
Thank you. Come on, guys.
It's just getting to the good part.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.526
Hello? Hold on. Hello?

06:00.610 --> 06:01.861
Sorry, you need to hold on.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.196
Man, I wish everybody
wouldn't show up late.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.866
- I need a break.
- What?

06:06.950 --> 06:08.743
He's good. That's good. That's funny.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.539
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.709
You know, we... We showed this
at the board of directors meeting,

06:16.793 --> 06:20.046
and the top brass was so
impressed that they promoted me.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.173
You know what?
You should put this up on YouTube.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.716
I bet it'd get mad hits.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.135
I am not good enough for YouTube.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.471
But thank you for saying that.
Maybe one day...

06:30.766 --> 06:32.391
-Thank you, guys.
-Okay, cool.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.686
-Hey. Montez, right?
-Mm-hmm.

06:35.771 --> 06:39.106
I'm Adam DeMamp.
I am such a big fan after seeing that.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.734
You're, like, the funniest human
being I've ever seen.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.070
Well, listen, George
don't even let me be me.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.572
He cut out this little funny look I do,
like a dramatic chipmunk.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.575
- Mmm-mmm-mmm!

06:49.659 --> 06:51.160
That was, like... That was unique.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.412
That was... I've never even
seen anything like that.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.666
Well, you know, the thing is,
George, he cut my joke.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.627
And it hurt.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.921
--It felt like he bit my finger.

07:02.005 --> 07:05.716
- George bit my finger...

07:05.801 --> 07:06.926
And my joke.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.762
Hey, do you think you could
be my funniness mentor?

07:09.846 --> 07:12.181
I can definitely be
your funniness mentor.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.934
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.650
With the striped shirt
and dumb soul patch

07:22.734 --> 07:24.110
Ooh, slam.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.653
Boy, you look
like a mole rat

07:25.737 --> 07:26.737
Mole rat, okay.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.155
No, no, no, no. You didn't know.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.865
Wow. We landed on mole rat.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.367
Very cool, very funny.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.620
-Oh, here we go.
-Limo.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.123
-It's, like, the President.
-This is cool.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.416
-Is that...
-Yo.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.293
- Is that Mark McGrath?
- What's up, boys?

07:41.378 --> 07:42.586
Sugar Ray just said, "What's up" to us.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.964
-Does he work here?
-That is Sugar Ray.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.841
- That is Sugar Ray.
- Who is she?

07:46.925 --> 07:50.511
Oh, yummy, yummy. My pee-pee
is pointing at my tummy, tummy.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.972
-Go on and get it, boy!
-Oh, my gosh.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.933
Listen, listen, listen, last night was...

07:56.017 --> 07:59.353
It was, like, physical, right?
But it was also spiritual.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.230
Did you feel that?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.107
Yeah, man. It was all right.

08:04.901 --> 08:08.612
Excuse me, did you just kiss Sugar Ray?

08:08.697 --> 08:10.156
I did a lot more than that.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.741
Let's just say McGrath
likes to Mc-munch.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.871
-Oh!
-Oh, she got snapped. She got snapped.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.205
Oh, yeah!

08:18.290 --> 08:20.249
I'll never forget you, Alice Murphy.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.334
Not never, ever.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.087
- She got him sprung.
- Wow. Okay.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.340
So let me guess.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.342
You three fresh meat just sat through

08:30.427 --> 08:33.345
Montez and George's
corny-ass orientation video?

08:33.430 --> 08:34.680
- Yeah.
- You right, you right.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.724
I thought
it was funny, but...

08:36.808 --> 08:40.603
Well, you don't seem like you
completely suck my pricksicle.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.438
Follow me. I'll deprogram you.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.276
Hey, uh, shouldn't we
get back to work?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.737
Mr. Burkeman
said 15-minute breaks.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.822
Yeah, like, somebody
might trick on us. I don't know.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.158
Look, when you crush
the phones as hard as I do,

08:54.242 --> 08:55.576
you make the schedule.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.454
- Yo, Jillian!
- Hey.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.582
Wait a minute. Hang on. Damn door.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.753
Hey, A-Train,
you looking to smoke a J?

09:06.129 --> 09:08.839
-Smoke a J.
-Oh, I got what you need.

09:08.924 --> 09:11.717
Calling it "That Blue Magic,"
from that new show Breaking Bad.

09:11.801 --> 09:12.843
-Have you guys seen it?
-Oh, sweet.

09:12.928 --> 09:15.888
Oh, I watched the entire season
through a window at Circuit City.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.556
That dude
from Malcolm in the Middle.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.308
-I love that show.
-Yeah.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.769
Oh, God, here comes
this fucking nerd.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.063
- What's up?

09:24.147 --> 09:25.648
-Yeah.
-Here, Jillian, deal with this.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.774
What's wrong with
George, though?

09:26.858 --> 09:28.776
-I mean, he seems straight.
-Oh, I don't know.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.987
Uh, I got braces
on the company's insurance,

09:32.072 --> 09:34.782
and then that dick
canceled everybody's plans.

09:34.866 --> 09:38.494
So now my teeth are fixed,
but I can't afford to get my braces off, so...

09:38.578 --> 09:39.828
Oh, that sucks.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.205
Jillian, what are you doing?

09:41.289 --> 09:43.916
- I'm smoking it down. What?
- No, get rid of it. He is right there.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.167
Oh, God, where do I put it?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.461
Someone, hide it. Here, I got it.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.296
Oh! Oh, oh, it burns!

09:49.381 --> 09:50.589
-It burns, it burns, it burns!
-Shh.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.383
Hey, guys, break's over.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.261
So why don't we get in there
and attack the phones?

09:55.345 --> 09:57.763
--T.A.C.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.349
All right, well,
I'll see you guys in the pit.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.977
-All right. Argh!
-Whoo! Whoo!

10:03.061 --> 10:04.395
Bye, George.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.897
Ugh, I cannot take him anymore.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.608
Why? He seems actually
like a really reasonable guy.

10:09.693 --> 10:10.818
Well, he's not, okay?

10:10.902 --> 10:13.070
He won't even hire me
'cause I'm a convicted felon.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.698
I was pissing next to a school. Next to.

10:15.782 --> 10:16.991
It doesn't matter.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.618
I'm quitting next week to be
a waitress at Mimi's Cafe.

10:19.703 --> 10:20.953
What?

10:21.037 --> 10:23.247
Anyway, we should fuck
before I leave.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.624
-Wait. What?
-Yeah, uh...

10:25.709 --> 10:28.085
No doubt. Yeah, that'd be cool.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.129
-Smooth, dude.
-Yes, that was smooth.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.714
-It's the suit, man.
-Yeah, it's looking good.

10:31.798 --> 10:32.798
Got them going, dude.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.508
That suit will get a girl
about it, about it.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.552
That's no doubt
about it, man. Whoo!

10:36.636 --> 10:39.221
Sucks that she's quitting
'cause of George.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.891
Well, what if, uh,
George didn't work here?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.894
Hey, you want to hang out?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.646
Uh, nah, we should probably
head inside.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.231
-Sorry.
-I wasn't talking to you.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.358
I was talking
to Larry the Cable Ferret.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.406
Hey, yo, George. You in here, man?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.116
You got a... You got a second?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.201
Yeah, I'll be out
in about ten minutes, guys.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.120
Uh, yo, uh...

11:03.204 --> 11:05.331
How would you like
to get promoted again?

11:05.415 --> 11:08.000
That's great. Listen, let's talk
when I get out of here, please.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.918
Look, this is
what we were thinking.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.005
We were thinking maybe you make
another hilarious video, okay?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.174
But this time, we post it on YouTube.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.676
Maybe make a channel
for the company.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.595
It goes viral. The bosses see it.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.430
And all of a sudden, now you're a big boss.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.683
-Yep.
-That is a great idea, guys.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.185
Thank you. Let's talk about...

11:26.269 --> 11:29.021
So it's kind of like
a parody of viral videos,

11:29.105 --> 11:30.689
but we set it
in the office.

11:30.774 --> 11:31.774
Okay, I'm interested.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.067
Then good.
You should watch these videos.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.736
-Yeah, I'll talk to you when I get out.
-No, no. Here's what it's gonna be.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.072
Why don't you just watch some of
these videos we could mash up?

11:38.156 --> 11:41.200
And let's see, we'll do, uh,

11:41.284 --> 11:43.369
Mini Mall Man, okay?

11:43.453 --> 11:44.912
--It's pretty funny.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.538
Living rooms, bedrooms

11:46.623 --> 11:50.084
Dinettes
Oh, yeah, you can find 'em

11:50.168 --> 11:51.794
Hey, Adam,
that guy has your suit on.

11:51.878 --> 11:55.214
I've never seen that video or any...
Really, hardly any video,

11:55.298 --> 11:56.757
but I doubt it's the same.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.967
Yeah. Oh, yeah, actually,
watch the "Charlie Bit Me" one.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.219
That one's, like, my favorite.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.054
Oh, it's right here, right here.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.348
-Oh, yeah, this one's hilarious.
-Ha, ha, Charlie.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.683
Charlie bit me.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.520
That's funny.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.

12:09.604 --> 12:10.604
Classic.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.857
Montez said, like, this exact
same thing to me earlier today.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.526
Yeah, he probably said it
from the video.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.112
He was saying like it was
his original stuff.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.530
I mean, he has original stuff.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.740
He does this, like, dramatic chipmunk.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.492
It's like a chipmunk that's...

12:23.576 --> 12:24.701
-He looks over his shoulder.
-Hold that thought.

12:24.786 --> 12:25.911
It's like, that's funny.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.831
'Cause when you put, like,
a personality on an animal...

12:29.249 --> 12:32.501
--Oh, my God.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.837
-Yeah, that's got...
-Montez is a liar.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.213
Thirty-nine million hits.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.756
-He's a freakin' sham.
-Okay.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.883
I'm the wow. See, that's funny.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.761
-ShamWow, right?
-You guys are annoying.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.763
But you showed me a lot
of initiative today.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.473
And to be honest, I wouldn't
mind having another outlet

12:46.558 --> 12:50.269
for some of my better impersonations,
like the Governator.

12:50.353 --> 12:53.063
I'll be back,
as soon as I go to my budget meeting.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.942
Get to the chopper
to make a budget meeting.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.610
Wow. Save it for the screen,
though, man.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.237
-Save it for the screen.
-Hey, real quick.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.531
Can we fire Montez
real quick? Real quick?

13:07.871 --> 13:09.705
Okay, and this crazy Monday
wake up and meet.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.956
Does it have to be the early morning?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.916
-Mmm...
-Can it just be morning?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.084
Well, I mean, it can
just be morning, yeah.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.878
Maybe on the day, yeah,
after I come...

13:15.962 --> 13:17.629
Hey, Bill, my man?

13:17.922 --> 13:20.174
I got some jeans for you.
Rawegian, that's my brand.

13:20.258 --> 13:23.218
And put them on for the video.
Keep them if you like them.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.471
Okay.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.473
Rawegian is in the building.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.141
And that was the skinny cut, right?

13:29.225 --> 13:32.060
-That's what's up.
-Outline city, here we come.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.271
Adam?

13:34.397 --> 13:36.648
Um, hot comedy tip.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.525
Try to do random stuff.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.777
Do random things.
Like cutting me out of the script

13:40.862 --> 13:42.321
when I'm the office funnyman.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.740
Okay, well, the reason
we cut you out the script...

13:44.824 --> 13:46.658
-Mmm-hmm.
-...is because you are a bitch.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.993
Oh, I'm a bitch, huh?

13:48.077 --> 13:50.746
Yes. Who steals his comedy
from the Internet.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.456
Isn't that what y'all are doing right now?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.708
No, no, what we're doing,
it's a mash up.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.420
Look, you need me in this video
if you want to get hits.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.922
Do you want to get hits?

14:00.006 --> 14:01.298
I want to hit you in the mouth.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.509
Oh, I wish you
would hit me in the mouth.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.260
Okay, Montez,
what's rule number one?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.845
No yelling in the office!

14:06.930 --> 14:08.972
Number two, do not scream, bitches!

14:09.057 --> 14:11.391
And number three, no violence!

14:11.476 --> 14:14.394
-George, this is our thing.
-This is their thing.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.479
Yup.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.397
And I got to sit you
on the bench for this one.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.942
-I'm the funnyman.
-One time, okay?

14:20.109 --> 14:21.860
-All right.
-I know it's scary.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.195
-I know it's scary.
-You scary.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.072
-I don't feel safe with him.
-Yeah, don't worry about it.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.782
-Who cares? Come on.
-We... We should fire him.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.367
- I don't feel safe.
- No, we can't fire him.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.577
-And then who would work here?
-Your jeans are too tight.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.371
Do I have to wear them?
I can't even...

14:32.455 --> 14:33.914
Hey, that's how Rawegian jeans fit.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.707
I mean, they look good to me.

14:35.792 --> 14:39.044
Yeah. Oh, hey,
actually, Ders, buddy... Ice.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.380
Yes, could you help him
with the wardrobe?

14:41.464 --> 14:42.881
I just want to make sure that...

14:42.966 --> 14:45.384
Yeah, just got to...

14:45.468 --> 14:47.386
God, I can't even walk.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.263
You got that? Here, let me get the...

14:49.347 --> 14:51.390
Where is that rewind button?

14:51.474 --> 14:53.225
I'm looking for
the rewind button right now.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.393
Okay,
you see the rewind right now?

14:54.477 --> 14:56.520
You know, I thought I did
but it was just fabric.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.729
Okay, well, maybe...

14:57.814 --> 14:59.398
What the hell's going on
with you guys?

14:59.482 --> 15:01.149
You want to see my junk? Is that it?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.526
Whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.735
You want to see it?
You want to see it?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.862
You want to see it?
You want to...

15:08.575 --> 15:09.658
Nah.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.671
Crazy Monday, wake up
in the early morn'

15:22.755 --> 15:25.090
Check on Ice
to see what he's doing

15:25.174 --> 15:26.300
-Hello
-What up, Ice?

15:26.384 --> 15:27.593
Yo, boss man, what's cracking?

15:27.677 --> 15:28.760
You thinking what I'm thinking?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.846
-Coffee time!
-Coffee time! Man, it's happening

15:35.059 --> 15:36.435
Blake's on the phone

15:36.519 --> 15:37.603
I'll bet that he's crushing

15:37.687 --> 15:40.314
If he sticks to the script,
he'll make a lot of money

15:40.398 --> 15:42.149
Phones will ring

15:43.192 --> 15:45.777
Would you like
to buy a microwave?

15:45.862 --> 15:47.571
Phones will ring

15:48.531 --> 15:51.199
Please, have
a very nice day

15:53.036 --> 15:55.454
It's a Monday. What?
At TelAmeriCorp

15:55.538 --> 15:57.998
It's a Monday. What?
At TelAmeriCorp

15:58.082 --> 16:00.584
We love Mondays. What?
At TelAmeriCorp

16:00.668 --> 16:02.878
'Cause Mondays rule
at TelAmeriCorp

16:08.426 --> 16:09.801
-Adam?
-Adam?

16:10.803 --> 16:13.472
Blenders,
vacuums, steak knives

16:13.556 --> 16:15.474
We sell them
at TelAmeriCorp

16:15.558 --> 16:17.476
You can find them
at TelAmeriCorp

16:17.560 --> 16:21.313
It's just like, it's just
like a mini mall

16:21.564 --> 16:23.815
This is awesome, man.
Now, all we got to do is, like,

16:23.900 --> 16:26.610
kind of tag it with buzzwords so people,
like, know where to find it.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.487
Tags. Those are the thing on the end?

16:28.571 --> 16:31.990
-Little words...
-Yep, okay. Uh-huh. Boobs, butts, cats...

16:32.075 --> 16:33.617
Yes, that will get plenty of eyes.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.661
But I think maybe we should
let Montez do it.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.163
- He's web savvy.
- Nope, he's a human walrus.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.040
I will do it, okay?
I'm, like...

16:40.124 --> 16:41.708
I'm becoming an Internet guy.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.543
After watching all these videos,
I'm getting...

16:43.628 --> 16:45.504
I'm getting in the, the Internet now.

16:45.588 --> 16:48.548
-Okay.
-I'll up... You upload it or download it?

16:48.758 --> 16:51.343
I'll put it in.
I'll inject it into the Internet.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.969
All right, everybody,
before we get started,

16:53.054 --> 16:55.847
I want to introduce a very special guest
who's joining us today.

16:55.932 --> 16:59.476
Ms. Lydia Hunt,
our amazing regional manager.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.978
Great to be here, guys.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.106
Before we get started,
I got to give a shout-out

17:04.190 --> 17:08.568
to the geniuses that put
this presentation together.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.821
Get up and say something, please.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.656
-Don't mind if I do.
-Thank you.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.157
Hey, thank you.
What an introduction, huh?

17:14.242 --> 17:15.701
Y'all know me as Ice.

17:15.785 --> 17:19.663
I guess I'll start off by saying
when we even approached the idea

17:19.747 --> 17:21.832
of doing a response video
to "Lazy Sunday,"

17:21.916 --> 17:25.001
we knew we had to recognize
those who came before us.

17:25.086 --> 17:28.338
-That's right.
-Lazy Monday, Lazy Mondsy.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.549
-Mm-hmm, right.
-And that's about it, really.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.092
-Yeah, that was it.
-We couldn't have done it

17:32.176 --> 17:34.928
without you guys
or the help of Red Bull.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.430
True that, true that.

17:36.514 --> 17:40.434
Which got us laser-focused and kept us
awake our entire lunch break

17:40.518 --> 17:41.935
-for once, right?
-For real.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.479
Maybe we should just
get it started. I'm excited.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.732
-Okay. Awesome.
-Okay, cool.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.027
Ready, and roll 'em.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.405
How do my boobs look today?
Do they look saggy?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.157
That's Lacey Jams.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.909
You look fine, baby.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.786
That's the mole man.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.832
Now we're gonna play
my favorite game.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.292
Suck-a-mole.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.836
Whoa! No, no!
Okay, that's the wrong...

18:07.920 --> 18:09.337
That's the wrong video.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.630
You're the mole man.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.341
You're fucking my wife?
I'm gonna kill you!

18:14.719 --> 18:16.595
Bill, sit down. George, outside, now.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.597
Okay, I'd like to say
goodbye to...

18:18.681 --> 18:20.682
Okay. All right, goodbye.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.185
-Go.
-Goodbye.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.605
Goodbye, George.
This is for you, my man.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.607
Okay, everybody.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.026
George is no longer
with the company. Yes, Bill?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.612
My penis mole
is just as big as his.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.573
Why don't you take the rest
of the day off, Bill, okay?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.950
It's a tough one.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.288
Now, where is Alice Murphy?

18:44.373 --> 18:46.374
-Yo, what's up?
-Ooh...

18:46.459 --> 18:48.585
Ha! There you are.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.462
As you know, we like to
promote from within,

18:50.546 --> 18:55.258
and we've been tracking your progress
and love your sales numbers.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.428
We'd like to make you
the new branch manager.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.889
I don't know. That sounds
like a lot of bullshit.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.518
Okay. Well, it is 72k a year,
plus full health and dental.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.562
Did you say dental?

19:13.569 --> 19:14.653
This is just fun.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.404
Like, having a job
is just fun, you know?

19:16.489 --> 19:17.864
We have these spinny chairs.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.492
I get to put up these photos of me
flexing all over the place.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.701
It's like no one's gonna stop me.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.328
- Right.
- You know?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.664
Uh-oh, here she is.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.833
How 'bout me and you
go find a dark corner

19:27.917 --> 19:30.627
to have some of that sex
that you won't shut up about?

19:31.462 --> 19:35.632
Yeah, that's not gonna happen,
'cause you are the help,

19:36.217 --> 19:38.468
and I'm middle
management now.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.679
I am done screwing around.

19:40.763 --> 19:44.432
And if you three jacknards
don't start dressing the part,

19:44.517 --> 19:46.810
you're out of here.
Do you hear that, do'rag?

19:47.395 --> 19:49.813
Okay. No, no, no, I get it.

19:49.897 --> 19:53.066
First day as the boss, you know.
Tensions are a little high.

19:53.150 --> 19:56.069
Speaking of high, why don't we
go outside, smoke a joint?

19:56.153 --> 19:59.698
Anyone caught doing drugs
in the office will be fired.

19:59.782 --> 20:03.118
And starting immediately,
there'll be random drug tests.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.036
I'm excited. What kind
of drugs are we testing?

20:05.121 --> 20:08.081
Oh! Oh-ho-ho.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.875
Oh, dude,
I give you my blessing

20:09.959 --> 20:12.294
to continue saying that
as the office funny guy.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.881
And I give you my blessing
to get the fuck back on the phones.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.174
Yo, A-Train, I couldn't
find any Kashi GoLeans,

20:18.259 --> 20:19.342
so I made you a bagel.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.721
Yeah, my name is Alice,
and this is not what I wanted.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.472
I wanted Kashi GoLean.

20:34.775 --> 20:38.403
Well, that was a fun stroll
down memory lane, guys.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.529
-It really was.
-Yeah.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.948
But I'm sorry. You're still fired.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.661
Do you remember when you
had sex with Ders on this desk?

20:51.709 --> 20:52.834
I do.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.588
I'll see you guys
at work tomorrow.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.261
Yeah, yeah!
It's on the other side.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.263
You got to shake...
You got to shake your butt.

21:05.348 --> 21:07.557
- Keep shaking. Keep shaking.
- Yeah.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.851
Nope. Mmm-mmm. Nope.
He must be wearing the tighty whities.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.021
- Shake harder.
- Maybe he taped it to his leg.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.690
- His pants are too messed up.
- You got to shake it.
