WEBVTT

00:07.374 --> 00:10.542
Ready to have your
socks rocked off?

00:10.710 --> 00:13.012
Those of you courteous
enough to wear socks.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.446
Just play.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.081
(grunting)

00:17.484 --> 00:19.051
(all grunting)

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:28.595 --> 00:30.195
Out.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.200
Way off,
hawkeye.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.736
(groaning)

00:40.440 --> 00:42.341
Out. And...

00:48.381 --> 00:49.615
Out.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.283
Again.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.418
(laughs)

00:52.420 --> 00:54.686
Bar none, the best
training session.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.088
What is that,
eight-zip?

00:56.090 --> 00:57.156
(growls)

00:57.158 --> 01:00.025
Yeah. Is there
a point to this?

01:00.027 --> 01:02.728
This isn't the best
team-building exercise

01:02.730 --> 01:03.829
You've ever come up with.

01:06.766 --> 01:09.334
Well, that's because this
isn't about team-building.

01:09.502 --> 01:11.336
It's about team-busting.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.505
When the cabal hijacked
my pre-play system,

01:13.507 --> 01:15.374
I had to put together
an even better program

01:15.376 --> 01:16.842
To give us an edge.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.745
New data, algorithms,
new everything.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.082
The stark
probability engine.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.616
It predicts a sure
path to victory

01:24.618 --> 01:26.218
In any combat situation.

01:26.453 --> 01:28.487
There are no sure
things in combat.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.855
You're forgetting
the human factor.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.624
The human factor
is in there. It's just...

01:32.626 --> 01:35.227
Insignificant.
Statistically speaking.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.162
Insignificant?

01:37.164 --> 01:38.630
(cracking neck)

01:39.699 --> 01:40.866
Do it again.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.835
We've got a little
surprise of our own.

01:43.336 --> 01:45.337
Activate the laser
battle balls.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.839
With pleasure.
(grunts)

01:52.545 --> 01:54.146
Sonic shredder.
(grunts)

01:55.248 --> 01:56.582
(grunting)

02:00.820 --> 02:02.354
Plant one at cap's feet.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.557
(grunts)

02:07.393 --> 02:08.526
(groans)

02:08.862 --> 02:10.628
I hate this game.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.865
Iron man: This is how
we'll beat the cabal.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.733
The probability engine
is perfect.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.135
No more surprises.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.870
(hyperion yelling)
(crashing)

02:19.139 --> 02:20.506
(both groaning)

02:21.774 --> 02:23.509
Um,
I'm surprised.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.776
Anyone else?

02:24.778 --> 02:25.878
Scanning.

02:26.913 --> 02:27.913
Locked.

02:28.883 --> 02:32.918
Okay. To be fair,
the probability engine
was off.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.266
(hulk yelling)

02:47.268 --> 02:48.901
Hyperion took hulk
to the river.

02:48.903 --> 02:50.569
Jarvis,
lock down the tower,

02:50.571 --> 02:52.371
And scan all frequencies
for the cabal.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.705
Looks like we get

02:53.707 --> 02:55.307
To trash the cabal
ahead of schedule.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.843
Stark probability
engine is active.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.717
Passengers:
Whoa!

03:06.486 --> 03:07.553
Ah!

03:07.555 --> 03:08.687
Iron man:
Thor, boat.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.755
Aye.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.502
Jarvis: <i> Sir,</i>
<i>there are no signs</i>

03:23.504 --> 03:24.903
<i>Of the cabal near the tower.</i>

03:24.905 --> 03:26.505
Iron man:
It's a distraction.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.240
I'm running the probability.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.809
Thor.
Get down there and...

03:30.811 --> 03:31.877
Iron man:
Hold on.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.679
S.P.E. Says
there's an 85% chance

03:33.681 --> 03:35.214
Attuma's waiting in ambush.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.582
S.P.E.?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.483
"stark probability engine."

03:38.485 --> 03:40.619
Ah. He's all
about the branding.

03:41.421 --> 03:44.856
Skull believes the asgardian
will appear any second.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.992
Falcon.
Funnel. Now.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.998
Red-wing mode.
Full thrust at 22 degrees.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.505
Prepare to... Huh?

04:05.545 --> 04:06.912
Nice try, attuma.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.680
(laughing)

04:10.984 --> 04:12.384
Fish out of water.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.319
(all groaning)

04:15.421 --> 04:17.623
Smoke and mirrors are
not enough to def...

04:17.625 --> 04:18.757
(groans)

04:19.892 --> 04:22.461
How about smoke,
mirrors, and mjolnir?

04:22.463 --> 04:25.731
Skull,
it's not going as planned.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.267
(hulk roars)

04:28.269 --> 04:29.401
Aah! Oh!

04:29.403 --> 04:30.736
Thor: Hyperion?

04:31.037 --> 04:32.304
Aah!

04:33.806 --> 04:34.940
"bye-perion."

04:35.642 --> 04:37.943
Ha! 'twas
a good one, no?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.847
Not good enough.

04:41.849 --> 04:42.881
Aah!

04:44.284 --> 04:46.018
Actually, it was
pretty good for thor.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.586
Comedy's like
his third language.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.754
Whoa!

04:49.555 --> 04:50.689
(roars)

04:51.024 --> 04:53.825
I'm not
through with you.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.294
(grunting)

04:56.796 --> 04:57.929
Aah!

05:05.338 --> 05:06.838
Hyperion,
disengage.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.939
Never.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.509
The numbers
do not lie, hyperion.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.712
There is a 75% certainty
of your failure.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.813
Disengage.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.683
More like 83%,
but who's counting?

05:17.917 --> 05:18.917
(groans)

05:23.823 --> 05:25.624
Still doubting
the numbers?

05:25.626 --> 05:26.925
Why don't you ask hulk?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.694
(groaning)

05:30.563 --> 05:32.531
We need to get him
back to the tower.

05:32.533 --> 05:33.832
This isn't over.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.607
The numbers do not lie?

05:43.710 --> 05:44.876
They do not.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.079
But sometimes we do.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.416
A masterful performance,
especially with the hulk.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.052
The first domino falls.

05:55.488 --> 05:56.655
(red skull laughs evilly)

06:01.427 --> 06:03.862
Two minutes before hyperion
knocked in our front door,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.664
This happened...

06:07.133 --> 06:08.867
A cosmic anomaly
in death valley.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.569
Lasted just a few seconds.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.371
No one was hurt, but...

06:12.373 --> 06:13.872
Falcon: It turned
the desert to glass.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.974
The energy readings
are off the charts.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.542
Readings we've seen before.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.911
Captain america:
Tesseract?

06:19.913 --> 06:22.848
The greatest power source
in the known universe.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.050
Though we've never
seen it do this.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.019
I think that the cabal
attacked to distract us.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.888
It was more than
a distraction, tony.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.690
They targeted hulk.
Until he heals...

06:31.692 --> 06:32.791
(roars)

06:32.793 --> 06:34.626
Hey.
I'm workin' here.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.429
I can take a pretty boy
in a cape any day, winghead.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.664
Ow!
Debatable.

06:39.832 --> 06:42.401
We should not underestimate
the skull's cunning.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.002
We're not
underestimating anyone.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.937
We're out-thinking them.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.906
Whatever the cabal's up to,

06:47.908 --> 06:50.409
With the s.P.E.,
we can handle it.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.011
Tony, we know
you're the smartest guy
on the continent,

06:53.013 --> 06:55.781
But there's more to what
we do than probability.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.149
Jarvis: <i> Sir,</i>
<i>shield satellites</i>

06:57.151 --> 06:59.184
<i>Are detecting a spike</i>
<i>in cosmic energy.</i>

06:59.619 --> 07:02.187
Triangulate its position now,
before we lose it again.

07:03.890 --> 07:04.856
There. Huh?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.458
(rumbling)

07:15.134 --> 07:17.636
Fury is gonna be so jealous.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.005
Not once it's a pile
of scrap, he won't.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.673
Do you think their
sudden departure

07:21.675 --> 07:23.475
Seems a little convenient?

07:26.646 --> 07:27.979
Sneaky little skull.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.817
They intercepted
the coordinates

07:31.819 --> 07:33.685
Of the tesseract
and have a head start.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.053
Move it or lose it, team.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.827
I can fly
faster than this.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.629
I can get to the tesseract
ahead of them.
Maybe figure out...

07:44.631 --> 07:47.532
S.P.E. Doesn't like your
chances in that scenario.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.167
Tony, I'm a scientist, too.
Okay?

07:49.169 --> 07:51.603
But even I think you're
getting a little obsessed

07:51.605 --> 07:53.672
With your new toy.
What's goin' on?

07:54.641 --> 07:59.511
Look, when the skull
hijacked my armor and
unlocked our playbook,

07:59.513 --> 08:03.582
He got our secrets.
I put you all in danger.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.116
It was a mistake, tony.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.852
I don't do mistakes.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.987
Even the best leaders
make mistakes, tony.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.622
You can't live in fear.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.657
Who said anything about fear?

08:12.792 --> 08:13.992
Fear comes with the job.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.927
It's how you deal
with it that matters.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.796
(scoffs)
if I told you the odds

08:17.798 --> 08:20.165
That you were gonna say that,
would ya hit me?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.800
No. But that will.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.802
Adaptoid at 12 o'clock.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.173
Captain america:
Brace for impact.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.008
Iron man:
S.P.E.'s got this.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.110
I hope.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.251
(grunts)

08:45.525 --> 08:48.226
Your magic number engine
didn't see that comin'?

08:48.228 --> 08:49.761
Actually, it did.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.030
I didn't want skull to
know we were ready for it.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.798
We weren't
ready for it, tony.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.300
You've gotta
let us do our jobs.

08:55.302 --> 08:58.169
Speaking of...
Falcon, now you can go.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.639
Fly ahead. Try and
secure the tesseract.

09:04.143 --> 09:05.911
Well,
I guess that's convenient.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.979
Hyperion's coming around.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.682
Is the plan to let him
punch us to the moon?

09:10.684 --> 09:12.117
Thought about it.
But how about

09:12.119 --> 09:13.818
Thor handles him instead?

09:13.820 --> 09:14.986
But the aven-jet.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.756
Trust me.
Hulk? Group hug.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.057
Oh, no.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.964
This is risky, skull.
The stakes are too...

09:25.966 --> 09:29.034
Red skull: I know the stakes
better than any of you.

09:29.201 --> 09:33.838
Imagine it as a simple game
of super-powered chess.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.107
And we are your pawns?

09:36.109 --> 09:39.077
Hardly, m.O.D.O.K.
You are my knights.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.312
(beeping)
what?

09:40.980 --> 09:42.314
(grunting)

09:46.285 --> 09:47.652
(hulk roars)

09:47.654 --> 09:50.088
Surprise!
(coughs)

09:50.790 --> 09:52.891
Admit it. You didn't
see that one coming.

09:52.893 --> 09:56.061
Have you gone mad?
You'll destroy us all.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.964
You know as well as I do
you can save us all
with one order.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.034
M.O.D.O.K.,
deploy the adaptoid.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.847
Hawkeye: Thanks.
(screams)

10:15.849 --> 10:16.982
(groans)

10:23.289 --> 10:26.057
Sam, we still have one big
bad guy unaccounted for.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.326
<i>Probability says</i>
<i>he's comin' to you.</i>

10:28.328 --> 10:31.029
Roger, tony.
Coming up on the coordinates.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.399
Wow, that's dark.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.734
(gasps)

10:44.977 --> 10:48.179
Red skull:
Your game has improved
considerably, stark.

10:48.181 --> 10:52.083
Just what sacrifices
you're willing to make?

10:52.985 --> 10:54.185
(grunts)

10:59.959 --> 11:01.292
(grunting)

11:04.964 --> 11:06.297
(both grunting)

11:16.042 --> 11:17.042
Aah!

11:21.814 --> 11:24.849
"fry-perion"?
Nay, too much.

11:28.921 --> 11:29.988
(grunts)

11:30.456 --> 11:31.790
(screams)

11:34.126 --> 11:36.294
Keep hitting him. Don't
let him use his mind mojo.

11:36.929 --> 11:37.962
You think?

11:37.964 --> 11:39.464
We're stretched
too thin, tony.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.868
We're winning.
Just stick with
your partners.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.439
Hulk's fighting with one
arm and falcon can't land.

11:47.441 --> 11:48.807
They're setting us up.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.909
Iron man:
Cap, please. Trust me.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.251
(grunts)

12:00.253 --> 12:02.387
He should listen
to you more often.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.090
Attuma:
Hello...

12:05.725 --> 12:06.891
Captain.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.960
Tony. They're doin'
a teleport swap.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.200
You said to stick
with our partners,

12:15.202 --> 12:17.068
But they
didn't stick with us.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.236
(groans)

12:19.772 --> 12:22.006
Whoa! Aah!

12:23.275 --> 12:24.976
No, they didn't.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.447
Huh?

12:31.917 --> 12:33.051
(roars)

12:37.757 --> 12:38.990
(both grunting)

12:38.992 --> 12:41.126
Kneel before me,
animal.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.094
(hulk screams)

12:43.096 --> 12:44.529
M.O.D.O.K. Just
blinked outta here.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.365
Tell me your
probability whosi-whatsis
saw this coming.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.900
Iron man:
<i>Just stay on target.</i>

12:48.902 --> 12:50.268
That's a "no."

12:53.506 --> 12:54.839
(groans)

12:55.074 --> 12:56.307
(laughs evilly)

12:57.910 --> 13:01.346
Hyperion. Coward.
Face the thunder.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.914
(modok clears throat)

13:05.885 --> 13:07.252
(cackling)

13:08.053 --> 13:10.822
How perfectly blonde of you.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.425
Aah!

13:18.063 --> 13:19.230
(groans)

13:19.465 --> 13:20.999
(grunting)

13:23.869 --> 13:24.969
Aah!

13:27.941 --> 13:31.876
This was your big play?
Swapping partners?

13:31.878 --> 13:33.311
Would it surprise
you to hear

13:33.813 --> 13:35.079
I was counting on it?

13:35.081 --> 13:37.081
I've been
planning this fight

13:37.083 --> 13:39.284
Since you formed
this little league team.

13:39.286 --> 13:43.154
I almost don't care about
beating you to the tesseract.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.390
What I care about
is shutting you down.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.560
The s.P.E. Said
there was a 99% chance

13:48.562 --> 13:50.962
You'd try to
take me on personally.

13:51.430 --> 13:55.233
Now it says there's a 100%
chance I'm gonna do this...

13:57.369 --> 13:58.469
No.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.005
Checkmate.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.107
My heart...

14:03.109 --> 14:05.944
Will be fine.
Your armor's shorted out,

14:05.946 --> 14:08.880
But it'll keep you alive
long enough to get to a cell.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.149
Don't feel too bad
about losing.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.051
You never really
had a chance.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.452
The numbers don't lie.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.256
(grunts)
so you say.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.592
So you always say.

14:24.865 --> 14:28.600
A few more seconds
and we'll end this for good.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.203
Not sure we have
those seconds.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.239
I'm getting my shield
handed to me down here.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.640
(groans)

14:35.642 --> 14:37.976
You said you didn't want
to make more mistakes.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.577
I think you're
makin' one right now.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.313
Skull is down,
and the tesseract
is just over this rise.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.983
Everything's played
out exactly as...

14:44.985 --> 14:46.618
Where's the

14:46.620 --> 14:50.021
Bright, shiny thing we've
risked our lives to grab?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.056
I'm at the exact
coordinates we...

14:52.058 --> 14:53.324
No.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.494
Skull didn't just
steal our coordinates,

14:56.496 --> 14:58.663
He replaced them
with false ones.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.065
I'm in the wrong place.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.903
Avengers,
break off your attacks

15:04.905 --> 15:08.006
And converge on the skull.
Converge on the skull.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.208
Red skull: <i> They can't hear,</i>
<i>stark.</i>

15:10.210 --> 15:12.076
<i>Even if they wanted to.</i>

15:12.078 --> 15:13.344
(grunting)

15:18.017 --> 15:19.117
(groaning)

15:19.952 --> 15:21.119
(grunting)

15:25.024 --> 15:26.257
(groans)

15:27.026 --> 15:28.293
(laughs)

15:29.361 --> 15:30.929
(grunting)

15:31.063 --> 15:32.130
Aah!

15:33.165 --> 15:34.332
Aah!

15:37.002 --> 15:38.202
(gasps)

15:38.570 --> 15:40.071
What? No way.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.106
(cackling)

15:59.059 --> 16:02.060
What do your
numbers say now?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.596
They say we can't win.

16:09.601 --> 16:12.603
Jarvis: <i> Armor integrity is</i>
<i>down to less than 5%.</i>

16:12.738 --> 16:16.007
I'd just as soon never hear
the word "percent" again.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.141
Thank you.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.712
A true genius
manipulates the odds.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.614
He does not let
them manipulate him.

16:24.116 --> 16:27.118
You were right.
I couldn't win against you.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.686
Not without the tesseract.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.289
So, I let you follow
your precious numbers

16:31.291 --> 16:33.124
To their logical conclusion.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.026
(groans)

16:35.394 --> 16:39.263
Two miles away.
Amazing, isn't it?

16:39.498 --> 16:42.166
A decimal point
shifted one place,

16:42.568 --> 16:46.738
And your entire strategy
becomes naught
but empty figures.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.721
That can't be happening.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.592
It already happened.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.794
Enough posturing,
skull.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.763
Let's finish them
and be about our work.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.502
(groans)

17:18.470 --> 17:20.405
What's happening?

17:20.406 --> 17:23.473
Modok: The tesseract
is unstable.
If we are to keep it,

17:23.476 --> 17:25.742
We must contain it.
Stabilize it.

17:25.744 --> 17:28.813
You have no choice.
Would you risk it all now

17:28.815 --> 17:30.314
For petty revenge?

17:31.550 --> 17:34.719
If you leave them alive,
they'll come after us.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.488
They're beaten.
Not broken.

17:40.692 --> 17:44.095
And now you'll see the lesson
that I have learned,

17:44.097 --> 17:46.197
Which your
fragile ego has not.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.834
Better to create the odds
than to play them.

17:55.107 --> 17:59.277
Two missiles.
Los angeles, las vegas.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.779
Which city
will you save?

18:01.781 --> 18:04.816
Or will you let both
perish to follow us?

18:07.853 --> 18:09.353
(growls)

18:12.091 --> 18:14.792
Iron man: Cap, I...
I messed up bad.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.495
Save it.
What can those missiles do?

18:17.729 --> 18:19.831
Normally, they wouldn't
even scratch the hulk.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.467
But augmented
by cosmic energy...

18:23.268 --> 18:26.170
I... I don't know
what to do.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.806
By my calculations,
we can only save one.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.142
And that's why
you have a team.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.377
For the one time when
the guy with all the answers

18:33.379 --> 18:34.545
Doesn't have the answer.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.283
Two teams. Power, speed,
and skill evenly split.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.219
You, thor, hawkeye,
and the widow on one.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.820
I'll take
falcon and hulk.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.155
Those missiles are shielded.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.457
They have the latest
evasion software.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.259
They were some
of my best stuff.

18:48.594 --> 18:50.595
We are your best stuff.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.631
Well, then...
Avengers, assemble!

18:55.634 --> 18:56.901
I have a visual
on the target.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.809
He wasn't kidding
about the countermeasures.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.278
We've handled worse
on the dodgeball court.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.646
You're kidding.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.881
He's not kidding.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.749
That didn't work
in dodgeball.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.518
Captain america:
It's called rising
to the challenge.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.686
Don't worry about my missile.
Worry about yours.

19:15.688 --> 19:16.854
Let's get ahead of it.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.189
I am.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.628
I thought your arm was hurt.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.330
It is.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.499
Shred it, hulk.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.569
You sure your shield
will protect you?

19:31.571 --> 19:32.870
Captain america:
Always.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.678
(both cheer)

19:40.680 --> 19:41.779
Captain america:
A little help?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.381
I'll catch up with cap.

19:45.284 --> 19:46.684
Iron man:
<i>One down.</i>

19:46.686 --> 19:47.885
Yeah.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.954
We're not gonna
let 'em show us up, are we?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.891
Jarvis:
<i>Even if your targeting</i>
<i>systems were online,</i>

19:53.893 --> 19:55.693
<i>You would be unlikely</i>
<i>to overcome</i>

19:55.695 --> 19:57.962
<i>The missile's</i>
<i>supercharged shielding, sir.</i>

19:57.964 --> 20:00.898
Sometimes I'm too good
for my own good.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.233
Aah!

20:08.674 --> 20:10.908
You give me
the right weapon,
I can hit it.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.510
No one can hit it.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.245
Just figure out
your power problem.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.316
Put this on.

20:18.850 --> 20:20.251
Whoa.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.652
Aim for me.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.820
<i>Seriously?</i>

20:22.822 --> 20:25.623
<i>Cool.</i>
<i>All I need is two shots.</i>

20:25.924 --> 20:27.525
<i>One to make it move...</i>

20:27.527 --> 20:29.961
And the second has to be
big enough to take it down.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.696
Thor,
I need a jump.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.863
With pleasure.

20:37.502 --> 20:38.769
(groaning)

20:40.973 --> 20:44.008
Jarvis: <i> Sir, cells are</i>
<i>up to 305% capacity.</i>

20:44.010 --> 20:46.477
Anytime now, hawkeye.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.512
Black widow:
Not to rush you,

20:48.514 --> 20:50.648
But the missile's
about to hit its target.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.916
Now.

20:52.551 --> 20:53.884
And...

20:55.254 --> 20:56.420
Blam!

20:57.389 --> 20:58.489
Yeah!

20:58.491 --> 20:59.857
And that, my friends,

20:59.859 --> 21:02.593
Is what 100% probability
looks like. (laughs)

21:02.595 --> 21:03.995
Can I keep this?

21:05.364 --> 21:07.365
(grunting)

21:09.868 --> 21:11.435
Run it again.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.038
Any sign of the tesseract?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.974
No. Skull's smart enough
to have it shielded.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.777
We won't know where it is
until he comes
knocking with it.

21:20.412 --> 21:21.712
You know this is bad.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.348
Tony,
we can handle bad.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.783
We're not numbers.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.817
Yeah.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.052
(beeping)

21:29.288 --> 21:30.988
We're avengers.
