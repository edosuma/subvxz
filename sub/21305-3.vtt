00:00.010 --> 00:00.790
I'm pregnant.

00:02.850 --> 00:04.050
You were a cute kid.

00:04.100 --> 00:07.110
I'm excited, Helen. This
is a new start for us.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.750
So... is it mine?

00:08.800 --> 00:11.550
I want to be a part of it's life
and I want to be a part of yours.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.470
Adam Perrin? Tell me it's not his.

00:13.520 --> 00:14.870
Helen! Tell me.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.590
- I don't know.
- Why?

00:16.640 --> 00:18.190
Why would you do this to me?

00:18.240 --> 00:20.310
Please come home, let's at least try.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.860
Do you know, Helen, right now
I can't even look at you.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.070
T. Everyone's nervous
the first time. Be cool.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.950
What's with the AC in this piece of shit?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.390
No-one else is busting a
sweat. S'all I'm saying.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.150
Can we have some tunes on, or summat?

01:36.720 --> 01:39.470
No tunes. You need to concentrate.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.600
Yeah, lad, you want to join the
crew, you've gotta do this.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.470
Right, that's the one.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.800
- Why this one?
- She chose herself.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.440
Right, do it.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.990
Do it!

02:21.040 --> 02:22.790
Take the shot.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.230
Go, go, go on, drive!

02:34.320 --> 02:35.880
There you go, Helen.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.720
Thanks.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.440
Come in.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.190
Surprise!

02:59.240 --> 03:01.030
Surprise!

03:01.080 --> 03:03.710
- Woo!
- Ah... you guys.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.350
We knew you were going to
try and sneak out quietly.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.270
We weren't going to let
that happen. Come here.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.750
Right, how does this work? Hold on.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.030
- How do, how do we do this?
- Just...

03:12.080 --> 03:14.150
There you go.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.710
Oooh.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.750
Are you all right?

03:17.800 --> 03:19.990
Helen, is it the baby?

03:20.040 --> 03:21.430
Shit, call an ambulance.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.800
No! Surprise!

03:26.240 --> 03:29.070
Oh, come on, I've got loads
of hormones flying around.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.840
That's really funny!

03:34.520 --> 03:36.350
Thank you, Brian.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.310
Ah, thanks.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.950
Was that for me? Thank you.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.910
So are you ready for all of this?

03:42.960 --> 03:45.430
- Maternity leave?
- Yeah.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.710
I've read the manual.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.360
The main thing is you just
try and keep them alive.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.190
- No, it's... No, Adam.
- Let me take that.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.790
- It's...
- That's all right, come on.

03:57.840 --> 04:00.240
Actually, yeah. Thanks.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.000
Yeah...

04:21.720 --> 04:23.190
Hello?

04:23.240 --> 04:25.390
In here.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.830
- Hiya.
- Hi.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.590
They threw me a party.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.910
Yeah, I, er, I know,
they invited me along.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.430
Oh, you declined?

04:33.480 --> 04:36.190
- Well, I know how much you
hate that kind of stuff. - Yeah.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.550
Who was there?

04:37.600 --> 04:38.960
Oh, just the usual.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.150
- Right. - This thing can't
sit still for two minutes.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.750
Well, it, er...

04:44.800 --> 04:46.200
It takes after its mother.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.150
Have you not eaten since breakfast?

04:49.200 --> 04:51.870
No, but I've got a mountain of
work to get through so I'm not...

04:51.920 --> 04:54.630
Oh, I can, I can make something quick?

04:54.680 --> 04:57.510
Yeah, yeah, all right. Something quick.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.440
This is good.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.830
Are you off this weekend?

05:06.880 --> 05:08.640
Erm, 50-50, why?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.350
We spoke about looking at houses

05:11.400 --> 05:13.790
and I thought I'd set
up some appointments.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.280
Yeah, I-I don't know what
I'm doing, I'm sorry.

05:18.160 --> 05:21.310
We are going to have to get
a bigger place with a baby.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.790
Helen, babies are like this big, you
know, they sleep in Moses baskets.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.790
But the prams and changing
tables and all the other crap that

05:27.840 --> 05:30.630
we've yet to assemble, that
doesn't take up any space at all.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.110
So we're going to kill ourselves
with a massive mortgage

05:33.160 --> 05:35.470
- because we're a little bit cramped?
- We can afford it.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.950
Yeah, we can, if we never go out again.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.590
We're having a baby, of course
we're never going to go out again.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.070
Have you spoken to the DCI yet?

05:44.120 --> 05:46.110
About what?

05:46.160 --> 05:48.310
About extending paternity leave.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.350
No, I haven't, Helen. He's got more
important things to think about.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.790
And, do you know what,
quite frankly, so have I.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.400
- More important than your child?
- My child?

05:57.720 --> 05:59.920
Oh, let's hope so, hey.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.870
Hey, Daddy's got a new job.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.590
Shhh, but don't tell Mummy.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.120
Ohhh...

06:23.280 --> 06:26.030
All right.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.630
It's started again with Paul.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.230
The Adam hating?

06:30.280 --> 06:32.790
He doesn't want to kill him any more,

06:32.840 --> 06:35.070
which I'm seeing as progress, but...

06:35.120 --> 06:37.670
It's just cos the baby's getting closer.

06:37.720 --> 06:41.270
Maybe Paul is worried about how
he's going to feel when he sees it.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.760
He'll love it.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.680
He'll be a really good dad.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.390
I just want Paul to be there for me.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.990
He will be.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.590
He WILL.

06:53.640 --> 06:57.480
Every time he looks at me it's like I've
got whore written across my forehead.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.400
Look, just go out
together and have some fun.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.710
It's a female conspiracy.

07:11.760 --> 07:15.830
Is it bollocks! It's like shelling peas.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.470
- What?!
- Shelling peas.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.150
It's all designed to make us
men feel like we couldn't do it.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.870
- You couldn't. - I'll tell you
what, I got kicked in the...

07:22.920 --> 07:25.110
In fact, Paul was there,
he'll back me up on this.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.470
This I have to hear.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.350
I got kicked in the nuts
by a guy with a machinegun.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.830
We've all been there.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.190
Er, are you seriously trying to tell me

07:33.240 --> 07:35.110
that childbirth's any
more painful than that?

07:35.160 --> 07:37.550
Well, I'll tell you what, how
about you come with me to the

07:37.600 --> 07:39.710
labour and we'll use
your arm to bite down on

07:39.760 --> 07:42.430
- and then we can gauge how much
pain I'm in. - There you are.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.150
- It's nature. - Why would Mother
Nature make it painful? - You tell us.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.870
- Are you going to back me up here?
- You lost us at shelling peas,
Gaz, I'm not getting involved.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.630
- We're supposed to be partners!
- Godfather material? - Yeah.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.120
Godfather, fairy godmother...

08:42.000 --> 08:44.110
I'm scared.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.640
What of?

08:51.160 --> 08:54.920
They say that having a baby
puts a strain on a relationship.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.200
Do you think we can handle any more?

09:01.880 --> 09:03.400
Helen...

09:05.080 --> 09:08.110
I wish things could be different too.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.750
OK?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.070
But they're not

09:12.120 --> 09:14.200
and we just have to make the best of it.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.640
I am so...

09:25.280 --> 09:27.230
I'm so, so sorry.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.830
Yeah, I know.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.440
I know.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.040
God.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.030
Hi, it's Paul... leave a message.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.000
Hey! You're late, call me.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.800
Love you.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.550
And again!

12:22.280 --> 12:23.670
Helen, I'm sorry.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.360
It's Paul.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.630
So what was he doing there?

14:04.680 --> 14:06.470
We don't know.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.710
A bus stop, in Gorton, at midnight...

14:08.760 --> 14:10.350
It must've been work?

14:10.400 --> 14:13.030
- We assume.
- What do his notes say?

14:13.080 --> 14:14.870
He hasn't been writing them.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.790
Since when?

14:16.840 --> 14:19.240
Paul's movements have
been a bit sketchy lately.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.230
Sketchy?

14:22.280 --> 14:24.310
We didn't even know he
was working last night.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.630
He told Gary he was staying at home.

14:26.680 --> 14:30.360
There isn't anywhere you think he
might've been that might explain...

14:35.320 --> 14:38.520
Are you asking me if I think
he was cheating on me?

14:39.840 --> 14:43.630
Are you asking me if I think my
dead partner was screwing around?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.430
Is that seriously what you're asking?

14:45.480 --> 14:46.960
No, Helen, not at all!

14:48.560 --> 14:50.630
We'll get to the bottom of it.

14:50.680 --> 14:51.880
Helen!

15:57.880 --> 16:00.710
Manchester Metropolitan
Police have launched a major

16:00.760 --> 16:03.950
investigation following the
death of one of their officers,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.360
Detective Inspector Paul Hopkins.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.520
Gary!

16:15.440 --> 16:17.310
He was distracted.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.710
Maybe it was the baby
coming, I don't know.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.710
Distracted... how?

16:21.760 --> 16:25.310
A lot of time away from the
office, vague explanations,

16:25.360 --> 16:28.390
I tried talking to him about
it but he just batted it away.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.310
We all have times like
that though, don't we?

16:31.360 --> 16:33.150
It's a stressful job.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.950
So what was he working on?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.790
- Don't know. They're checking.
- Well, you're partners.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.520
So were you.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.040
Did he tell you everything?

16:44.640 --> 16:47.670
What was he doing in Gorton at a bus stop

16:47.720 --> 16:49.390
when he has a car?

16:49.440 --> 16:52.590
If you start torturing yourself with
questions you're going to get ill.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.840
You need to grieve. Look
after yourself and the baby.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.640
- Are you all right?
- What's up, T?

17:42.200 --> 17:43.630
What's that you're looking at?

17:43.680 --> 17:45.520
Oh, it's just the news.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.550
Right, bro, you need to forget
about that now, it's done.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.760
Right? C'mon.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.590
Easy, about that shooting....

17:57.640 --> 17:59.870
You passed the test. You smashed it, bro.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.030
He was a police officer,
he had a kid on the way.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.390
So? That's one less fed, bro...

18:03.440 --> 18:05.910
They're not just going to let
us kill one of their own.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.150
The feds don't know nothing,

18:07.200 --> 18:09.830
they don't even know where to
start looking so, as long as you

18:09.880 --> 18:12.110
keep that shut, and that
means no fucking pillow talk,

18:12.160 --> 18:13.830
we'll be sweet.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.790
All right, just relax.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.990
OK.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.710
Right, so, Wave and Mikey stay in the car,

18:20.760 --> 18:22.990
they handle first contact with the cat.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.590
Find out what he wants,
take the cash, then send them

18:25.640 --> 18:28.110
over to the youths. Where
do you think he's going?

18:28.160 --> 18:29.470
To get the stuff for...

18:29.520 --> 18:31.670
Exactly, so he's going
to go off, get the food,

18:31.720 --> 18:34.230
and then bring it back to the
cat and then back to square one.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.630
Then Mikey, every time
he hits four, five ton,

18:36.680 --> 18:39.950
take it back to the flat,
drop it off and then come back.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.240
What's happening, bro? Sweet.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.480
- All right, boy.
- All right.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.390
Right, come on.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.670
Make sure the cash goes in
this box after every drop off.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.870
Then at the end of the
day, I'll come and collect.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.630
It's easy work. If Snap
can do it anyone can!

19:08.680 --> 19:12.200
Yeah. Right, wait there, actually.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.510
Right, never bring your
phone to work, keep this one,

19:16.560 --> 19:18.430
and don't save numbers in it either.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.390
- Right.
- See?

19:20.440 --> 19:23.790
- Yeah. - Take a seat,
bro, part of the fam now.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.400
'They are two evenly matched teams...

19:28.720 --> 19:30.390
Is this Fifa?

19:30.440 --> 19:32.230
Play nice, yeah?

19:32.280 --> 19:33.880
See ya!

19:35.800 --> 19:38.350
Well, I'm not going to bullshit
you, Helen, we haven't got much.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.790
We suspect the BMW was targeted at random.

19:40.840 --> 19:44.470
The driver does PR for
a charity, no previous.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.310
Is it gang related?

19:46.360 --> 19:49.270
Well, the car was stolen in
Didsbury, doing the shooting

19:49.320 --> 19:51.710
on the other side of town
might've been a territorial thing.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.440
Why target a random woman?

19:54.720 --> 19:57.790
- CCTV?
- We're on it now.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.230
- Forensics? - The Mondeo was
burnt out when we found it,

20:00.280 --> 20:01.990
so we're not going to find much there.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.990
The BMW is still being examined.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.280
Where?

20:06.640 --> 20:09.320
We're doing everything as
quickly as we can, trust me.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.910
Any witnesses?

20:15.960 --> 20:18.750
A couple passing by in a car
think they might've seen another

20:18.800 --> 20:22.230
man talking to Paul. It's
possible he was just a passer-by.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.390
What about...

20:23.440 --> 20:25.590
What about the woman in the car?

20:25.640 --> 20:28.190
She's doing OK, she broke her collarbone.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.030
Her face is pretty smashed up.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.870
Have you got someone
staying with you? Family?

20:32.920 --> 20:34.670
Yeah, my sister lives close by.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.080
- And what about Paul's parents?
- They're at a hotel.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.030
Have you decided on a funeral?

20:42.080 --> 20:44.470
Yeah. I mean, we're definitely having one.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.880
I think that's for the best, don't you?

20:48.240 --> 20:50.710
I meant whether you wanted
an official police...

20:50.760 --> 20:51.880
Yeah, I know.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.950
- Can I have her address?
- I'm sorry?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.600
The woman in the BMW.
I want to talk to her.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.670
Is that a good idea?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.150
What do you want me to do, Ted?

21:05.200 --> 21:08.510
- Sit around wondering if I'll...
- Helen, go home.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.790
Rest...

21:11.480 --> 21:13.550
Sir.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.110
Hiya.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.560
- Hey.
- Have you got a second?

21:44.080 --> 21:45.960
Thank you.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.360
Will you be OK?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.790
I'm his girlfriend.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.720
The dead copper.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.960
Come in.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.990
When are you due?

22:34.040 --> 22:36.400
Just over a week.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.790
Is it a boy or a girl?

22:39.840 --> 22:42.310
It's definitely one of those.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.320
Have you got any names yet?

22:47.360 --> 22:49.350
We couldn't agree.

22:49.400 --> 22:53.640
So I'll either have my way
or I can honour his memory.

22:56.080 --> 23:00.080
I'll probably just decide when I
see its face, see what it suits.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.270
I'm sorry.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.910
Patrick, this is Helen,
she's a police officer.

23:05.960 --> 23:08.950
Jesus, we've done all that.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.190
- She's made a dozen statements.
- Patrick.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.230
It was Helen's husband that
got killed at the bus stop.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.790
Partner, actually...

23:17.840 --> 23:19.160
we weren't married.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.680
It must've been terrifying being shot at.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.160
It all happened incredibly fast.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.790
I know everyone says that,

23:39.840 --> 23:42.550
but one minute this car was alongside me

23:42.600 --> 23:44.310
and there were shots.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.800
Next thing, I'm in an ambulance.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.590
What were you doing in Gorton?

23:50.640 --> 23:52.710
What's that got to do with anything?

23:52.760 --> 23:54.390
Once a cop, always a cop.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.630
Actually, I'm not here
in an official capacity.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.150
- Then, what... why are you here?
- Patrick!

24:00.200 --> 24:02.560
I'm trying to understand
why my boyfriend died.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.560
Oh, yes.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.870
I'd been for a drink, with a friend.

24:11.920 --> 24:16.360
And before you ask, it was only one
drink and I wasn't over the limit.

24:21.680 --> 24:24.110
Did you think you were going to hate me,

24:24.160 --> 24:26.750
cos it was my car that...

24:26.800 --> 24:28.400
Yeah.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.830
I thought I might,

24:31.880 --> 24:33.590
but that would be stupid,

24:33.640 --> 24:35.800
you're just as much a victim as I am.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.480
I'm sorry, I don't know
why I came, I just...

24:45.800 --> 24:48.670
Do you think they'll ever
find the lads in that car?

24:48.720 --> 24:51.470
Well, where gangs are concerned
it's usually hard to get people to

24:51.520 --> 24:54.550
talk, but I'm sure my
colleagues will do their best.

24:54.600 --> 24:57.390
Oh, if you speak to them, your colleagues,

24:57.440 --> 25:00.030
- I wonder if you could do
me a favour. - Of course.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.750
It's the BMW.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.710
I need to know if they've
finished with it.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.630
Until we get the car back we can't
get the insurance sorted out, you see.

25:06.680 --> 25:08.880
I'll put it at the top
of my priority list.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.480
Don't worry, Sarah, I'll walk myself out.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.430
How much blood is there?

25:29.480 --> 25:31.950
I'm not, I'm not sure... a lot.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.190
Is there a problem?

25:34.240 --> 25:36.790
There can't, there can't be a problem.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.390
Try and stay calm, we'll
get you checked out.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.920
The baby's fine.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.350
Which is more than can be said for you.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.840
You really need to rest, Helen.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.880
"The best way to feel your baby kick..."

26:08.280 --> 26:10.720
I can feel you kick all the time, can't I?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.790
Boom like a shotgun.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.750
- All right.
- What's going on?

26:27.800 --> 26:29.270
Eh, are we going to get paid today?

26:29.320 --> 26:30.670
Yeah, I'll sort it out for you now.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.190
Right.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.880
Easy, will you sort him out?

26:41.520 --> 26:43.750
Know what you're going to spend it on yet?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.190
No, I don't know.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.270
Enjoy it, bro!

26:47.320 --> 26:48.760
Thank you.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.230
That's a lot of money, bro, what
are you going to spend it on?

26:54.280 --> 26:55.950
I dunno.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.830
No, you must know, what
you going to spend it on?

26:58.880 --> 27:00.240
He's joking, bro, go!

27:01.800 --> 27:04.510
- I asked you a question...
- SNAP! Taking the piss.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.040
- T, go back to your baby.
- All right.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.240
- See you later.
- What?

27:34.120 --> 27:37.200
- Hiya!
- Hiya, babe.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.720
Hello!

27:41.960 --> 27:43.990
How are you doing? Are you all right?

27:44.040 --> 27:46.870
Good. Exhausted. He won't stop feeding.

27:46.920 --> 27:50.430
He's going to end up
like a big, fat bruiser.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.270
You seen filth all over the street?

27:52.320 --> 27:53.990
Yeah, yeah, what's all that about?

27:54.040 --> 27:56.190
- Be about the dead cop, I suppose.
- What dead cop?

27:56.240 --> 27:58.150
You must've saw it on the TV!

27:58.200 --> 27:59.480
No.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.990
How was your day?

28:03.040 --> 28:05.790
Yeah, yeah, good, erm, wait there.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.400
Like I'm going anywhere.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.030
Ta-da.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.190
Whoa!

28:12.240 --> 28:13.350
You got one.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.110
I said I would. Told ya,

28:15.160 --> 28:17.960
I'm going to sort stuff out for
you and Leon, and I did, didn't I?

28:33.160 --> 28:35.360
Snap?

28:42.600 --> 28:43.760
Snap?

29:29.800 --> 29:33.390
I can do it... move down,
I want a better background.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.870
Make it look professional.

29:34.920 --> 29:36.720
Right, smile like you love me.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.640
God, that's so bad.

29:55.240 --> 29:59.400
Paul's things. We're clearing out
his locker cos someone needed it.

30:46.320 --> 30:49.280
'You have two new messages.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.480
Hey, you're late. Call me.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.680
Love you.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.550
- Paul?
- Is this Frank?

32:36.600 --> 32:38.110
Who's this?

32:38.160 --> 32:40.110
My name's Helen, I'm, er...

32:40.160 --> 32:42.630
- I'm Paul's girlfriend.
- OK.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.550
I'm sorry to call you like this.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.950
I was just going through his phone and...

32:47.000 --> 32:48.680
I'm afraid to tell you Paul's dead.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.910
You didn't know?

32:59.960 --> 33:02.350
No.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.710
It's been on the news.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.830
What news?

33:05.880 --> 33:07.670
How did it happen?

33:07.720 --> 33:10.110
- Accident.
- Accident?

33:10.160 --> 33:12.990
- Car accident.
- Was Paul driving?

33:13.040 --> 33:14.190
No.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.990
No, erm...

33:16.040 --> 33:17.270
he was hit.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.870
At a bus stop.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.520
Bus stop? He had a car.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.070
Yes, he did.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.270
We don't have the details...

33:25.320 --> 33:28.470
Dates yet for the funeral.

33:28.520 --> 33:32.350
Um, I have to wait until
they release his body

33:32.400 --> 33:34.470
but if you give me your address I can,

33:34.520 --> 33:37.430
I can send you the
details when I have them.

33:37.480 --> 33:41.550
It just, it just says
Frank on his phone, so...

33:41.600 --> 33:43.350
What's your surname?

33:43.400 --> 33:45.350
Linnell. Frank Linnell.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.510
And, er, an, an address?

33:47.560 --> 33:49.550
I'll call you.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.190
'I want to know about Frank Linnell.

34:03.240 --> 34:06.070
- Linnell? Where do you get that name?
- Who is he?

34:06.120 --> 34:09.070
Ask Organised Crime, he
ran chunks of Manchester.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.270
I've never heard of him.

34:11.320 --> 34:14.070
He's old school. He's had
everyone in his pocket.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.710
Now he employs dubious methods
securing contracts with

34:17.760 --> 34:20.310
building and development companies.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.310
He's not someone you'd want
to get on the wrong side of.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.550
Is there any reason Paul would've
been in contact with him through work?

34:26.600 --> 34:28.190
No. Why?

34:28.239 --> 34:31.320
They were in touch, like text
messages. One was friendly.

34:35.080 --> 34:38.310
You know what you were
saying the other day about...

34:38.360 --> 34:41.389
- About how he was distracted and it
was affecting his work. - Helen...

34:41.440 --> 34:44.870
No! Tell me the truth. Was he involved
in something that he shouldn't have been?

34:44.920 --> 34:46.350
I'm not saying that.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.469
- Well, then why was he hanging
out with criminals? - All right.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.920
He told me what happened.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.270
Your affair.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.620
If I'm honest, I think it
did his fucking head in.

35:00.840 --> 35:03.710
Me screwing around, it doesn't
explain, it doesn't explain

35:03.760 --> 35:06.270
why a man who's given his
life to banging people up

35:06.320 --> 35:08.790
- would suddenly turn bent. - He
wasn't bent. - How do you know?

35:08.840 --> 35:12.150
- Cos he hated corruption, we all do, don't we?
- Well, I hated infidelity,

35:12.200 --> 35:14.800
still ended up doing it.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.200
We're not always what we seem, Gary.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.910
Yeah, all right.

35:23.960 --> 35:26.070
All right, we'll get
your answers, I promise.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.990
But in the meantime, you
promise me something.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.350
Stay away from Frank Linnell.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.680
All right?

35:33.920 --> 35:36.080
Just promise me, Helen.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.560
Come here.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.830
He ain't dead, right.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.590
Cos if he's dead people
are going to ask questions

35:53.640 --> 35:55.390
and they'll want answers.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.350
So he ain't dead. You
don't know where he is.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.190
You ain't heard from him,
you don't know nothing.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.790
All right?

36:02.840 --> 36:04.640
All right!

36:07.360 --> 36:09.160
Take him out.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.750
Rest in peace, bro.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.600
Never thought it'd be you before me.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.470
What if it's the feds, bro?

37:01.520 --> 37:03.190
It ain't the feds, bro.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.510
Then who is it?

37:04.560 --> 37:06.510
Just trust me, it's not the feds.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.510
Then why was the newspaper there?

37:08.560 --> 37:10.350
Well, someone knows.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.230
Someone wants revenge, man.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.720
Go get in the car. Now.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.110
Come here.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.110
No, come here!

37:21.160 --> 37:24.110
Right, we're going to find
who did it and hit back.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.470
But in the meantime, we need to
stay on our toes and watch our backs.

37:27.520 --> 37:30.870
But business carries
on as usual. All right?

37:30.920 --> 37:32.310
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.320
Get in the car.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.910
You know, legally speaking,
that's trespassing.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.960
Adam's here.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.200
- You are joking?
- He wanted to see you.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.110
You let him in?!

37:55.160 --> 37:58.190
Look, when Paul was alive
things were different.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.070
But he might be the father of
your baby and you might need him

38:01.120 --> 38:02.600
in your life, so...

38:37.000 --> 38:38.990
What are you doing here, Adam?

38:39.040 --> 38:41.910
- I just wanted to offer
my condolences. - Bullshit.

38:41.960 --> 38:44.550
You send a card, you
send flowers, you don't

38:44.600 --> 38:47.190
turn up unannounced at someone's house.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.470
You wanted to see me, why?

38:49.520 --> 38:50.870
Because of this?

38:50.920 --> 38:53.520
Come on, you're a detective, work it out.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.600
We had a fling.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.350
An illicit, mucky little...

38:59.400 --> 39:00.720
Romance.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.080
And I want to be here for you.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.390
Thank you...

39:18.440 --> 39:19.920
that's beautiful.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.870
You're going to need me, Helen.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.230
Maybe not now, but in the weeks to come.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.760
God, you sound like my sister.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.920
You might... Helen.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.790
You want a relationship...

39:34.840 --> 39:36.190
with me?

39:36.240 --> 39:37.910
With a woman who gets pregnant

39:37.960 --> 39:40.470
and doesn't even know who the father is.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.390
You don't know me, so
don't wait, OK, Adam,

39:43.440 --> 39:46.670
cos I know what you're like,
Mr It'll All Be OK In The End.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.510
Life isn't like that, it's just a series

39:49.560 --> 39:53.840
of random events and sometimes
you win and sometimes you lose.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.710
And right now, I'm...

39:57.760 --> 39:59.760
I'm on a losing streak.

40:03.280 --> 40:05.000
Well, I love you.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.830
Are you sure you don't
want me to drive it home?

40:22.880 --> 40:24.630
It's only a car.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.950
Yes, but erm...

40:27.000 --> 40:30.550
isn't it going to be rather upsetting?

40:30.600 --> 40:32.110
It's Paul's car.

40:32.160 --> 40:33.720
I'll deal with it.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.160
If it gets too much I'll call you.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.320
Given up, my arse.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.960
Your daddy was a liar.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.080
Excuse me?

43:06.840 --> 43:08.390
Is Frank in?

43:08.440 --> 43:09.830
Who are you?

43:09.880 --> 43:11.440
Paul's girlfriend.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.000
It's Paul's girlfriend.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.200
He says come through.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.870
Helen.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.440
It's a privilege.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.840
No, I'm fine, thanks.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.800
Nice place... when it's finished.

44:53.640 --> 44:56.000
It's been sat here derelict for years.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.120
Just needs some love.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.510
How long left? It can't be long now.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.280
Don't make any loud noises.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.590
Are you taking time off or are
you one of these modern types?

45:10.640 --> 45:12.840
I came here to talk about Paul.

45:14.640 --> 45:15.920
I'd like that.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.870
How did you know him?

45:19.920 --> 45:22.150
We met six years ago.

45:22.200 --> 45:25.310
He was part of a team
on a case I was close to

45:25.360 --> 45:27.680
-- the murder of someone I loved.

45:29.320 --> 45:31.150
Paul was terrific.

45:31.200 --> 45:34.670
One or two of his colleagues
weren't quite so sympathetic,

45:34.720 --> 45:36.320
if you know what I mean.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.120
I've got a bit of a reputation.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.800
Means some people see me a certain way.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.240
But Paul wasn't like that.

45:51.480 --> 45:52.800
And after?

45:53.960 --> 45:55.440
We stayed in touch.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.390
Is that it?

45:58.440 --> 46:00.280
We became friends, I suppose.

46:02.040 --> 46:03.640
We were friends.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.600
He was a good man.

46:08.640 --> 46:12.710
So you, you'd go to lunch,
go out for a drink together?

46:12.760 --> 46:15.510
Yeah, lunch, talk about this and that,

46:15.560 --> 46:17.560
sometimes we'd go to the cricket.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.310
Cricket?

46:21.360 --> 46:23.280
Oh, yeah, he loved a bit of cricket.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.720
So this reputation of yours...

46:42.160 --> 46:44.950
Paul knew about that, presumably,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.630
and it was never a problem for him?

46:47.680 --> 46:49.390
Didn't seem so.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.070
When did you last see him?

46:51.120 --> 46:52.590
Day before he died.

46:52.640 --> 46:54.790
No, I know that, I saw the text.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.110
So why are you asking?

46:56.160 --> 46:58.550
I also saw his text to you.

46:58.600 --> 47:00.910
"I need this."

47:00.960 --> 47:03.840
What was that about, what did he need?

47:06.640 --> 47:08.710
I can't remember now.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.230
Oh, come on. "I need this" --

47:10.280 --> 47:13.080
sounds quite significant, doesn't it?

47:16.040 --> 47:17.560
Was it money?

47:22.040 --> 47:23.960
Paul asked me to help him out.

47:25.840 --> 47:27.710
To pass on a few names.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.910
People I thought he could talk to.

47:29.960 --> 47:31.630
What kind of people?

47:31.680 --> 47:33.230
I told him I couldn't help.

47:33.280 --> 47:35.070
Well, that I didn't want to.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.750
What kind of people?

47:36.800 --> 47:38.430
People in my line of work.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.840
Criminals?

47:41.600 --> 47:43.360
Why did he ask, Frank?

47:51.680 --> 47:53.150
Helen...

47:53.200 --> 47:54.640
Paul was my friend.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.160
I'm devastated by what has happened.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.630
But if you're looking to point fingers,

48:03.680 --> 48:05.880
you're pointing in the wrong place.

48:16.840 --> 48:18.990
Good luck with the baby,

48:19.040 --> 48:21.040
parenthood's a wonderful thing.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.950
What does "no fucking tuna" mean?

48:31.000 --> 48:35.080
In your text you said, "no
fucking tuna", what does it mean?

48:36.920 --> 48:39.110
He was bringing me lunch,

48:39.160 --> 48:41.000
sandwich.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.400
Can't stand the stuff.

48:56.840 --> 48:58.630
- All right.
- See you later.

48:58.680 --> 49:00.960
- Later.
- In a bit, Mikey.

49:35.560 --> 49:37.670
Mikey, it's Theo, I've got a problem.

49:37.720 --> 49:38.910
Which is?

49:38.960 --> 49:41.430
I think I'm being followed,
there's two guys, what shall I do?

49:41.480 --> 49:43.750
Are you sure you're just
not being paranoid, T?

49:43.800 --> 49:45.390
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- OK.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.990
Go somewhere lively, then,
get to the pub quick time.

49:48.040 --> 49:50.310
I'll get the boys and we'll come grab you.

49:50.360 --> 49:52.390
But what if I don't reach you in time...

50:03.400 --> 50:05.240
Mikey?

51:04.360 --> 51:07.710
So... have you found anything?

51:07.760 --> 51:10.870
Yes, do you mind if I just see
those, er, those parking tickets?

51:10.920 --> 51:12.560
Ah, yeah.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.720
Thank you.

51:18.400 --> 51:20.200
Yes, I got it right.

51:22.520 --> 51:25.320
- Would you like to see the
first recording? - Please.

51:32.240 --> 51:35.280
He looks like a right dodgy
so and so, doesn't he?

51:59.760 --> 52:03.120
So, would you, erm, would you
like to see the next one?

52:04.520 --> 52:06.320
OK, here we go.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.070
Same bloke,

52:10.120 --> 52:11.600
Mr Dodgy.

52:16.200 --> 52:20.520
He must have a few quid, eh, jumping
in taxis left, right and centre.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.550
Can you push up on that last clip?

52:23.600 --> 52:26.840
- Erm, yeah. - Freeze frame
on the taxi? - Mmm-hmm.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.800
It's the same taxi.

52:36.880 --> 52:38.750
Oh, yeah! Good spot.

52:38.800 --> 52:40.040
Same reg number.

52:58.600 --> 53:01.550
Theo, Theo, what's going on?

53:01.600 --> 53:04.590
I aimed to miss. Something's wrong, like.

53:04.640 --> 53:07.550
I wasn't even aiming at
her but, but he's dead.

53:07.600 --> 53:10.270
A copper's dead and now
they're coming for us.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.750
What have you done?

53:11.800 --> 53:17.110
JAVINE! Right, someone is coming to
get us. We have to go now, help me.

53:17.160 --> 53:19.510
- We've got a baby!
- JAVINE!

53:19.560 --> 53:22.550
They're going to kill us,
they'll kill us all. Help me!

53:22.600 --> 53:24.120
Put that in there!

54:08.280 --> 54:09.680
Are you all right, love?

54:12.120 --> 54:15.150
Sorry, I'm only just about
to start my first shift.

54:15.200 --> 54:18.390
Are you, er, are you Ray Jackson?

54:18.440 --> 54:19.720
Yeah.

54:25.080 --> 54:27.830
Do you, er, do you want to
hop into the back of your car?

54:27.880 --> 54:29.760
We can have a talk there.

54:37.520 --> 54:40.030
Is this going to take long?

54:40.080 --> 54:42.510
- No, it's not going
to take long. - Good.

54:42.560 --> 54:46.390
I just want to ask you about a passenger, police
officer, that you had in your cab on Friday.

54:46.440 --> 54:49.150
- Which one?
- I'm sorry?

54:49.200 --> 54:54.310
- Which Friday? - September the
30th and the Friday before that.

54:54.360 --> 54:57.150
Have you got any idea how many
passengers I carry in a week?

54:57.200 --> 55:00.950
You picked him up outside the
NCP building on Briary Street.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.990
OK, I'll take your word for it.

55:03.040 --> 55:05.350
No, you don't need to take my word for it.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.670
We've got both pick-ups on CCTV.

55:07.720 --> 55:11.870
So? I wasn't speeding, I
didn't park on double yellows.

55:11.920 --> 55:14.990
I just want to know who
the other passenger was,

55:15.040 --> 55:18.320
the man who was already in the
cab when you picked him up.

55:20.040 --> 55:22.670
I don't have to talk to
you, I've done nothing wrong.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.550
The police officer I'm talking
about was killed last week

55:25.600 --> 55:28.550
so actually, you do need to talk
to me, unless you want a whole

55:28.600 --> 55:31.800
load of other police officers all
over you like shit on a blanket.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.800
Who was the other passenger, Ray?

55:41.200 --> 55:43.080
I drive for a client sometimes.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.790
He's a respected businessman,

55:47.840 --> 55:51.590
it's an exclusive basis,
and he supplements my fares.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.790
Name?

55:53.840 --> 55:55.630
Kevin Sherwood.

55:55.680 --> 55:57.790
Where did you take them?

55:57.840 --> 55:59.720
Mr Sherwood and the police officer?

56:04.280 --> 56:07.240
I really think you need to go home.

56:09.640 --> 56:12.670
Things can go wrong,

56:12.720 --> 56:14.240
I've seen it happen.

56:17.880 --> 56:21.230
The last thing you want is for
something to happen to your baby.

56:21.280 --> 56:25.400
Mr Sherwood doesn't like people sticking
their nose in where it's not wanted.

56:27.240 --> 56:28.940
Please stop asking questions...

56:31.200 --> 56:34.100
.. or you might find out something
you don't want to know...

56:36.040 --> 56:37.880
.. about that dead cop.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.310
Who are you, then?

57:12.360 --> 57:14.990
- Kevin Sherwood. It's best if you
leave it alone. - Is that a warning?

57:15.040 --> 57:16.310
You need to let me in.

57:16.360 --> 57:18.190
It's kill or be killed, boys.

57:18.240 --> 57:21.430
I've got bleach and I will
use it in your fucking eyes!

57:21.480 --> 57:23.110
Be careful...

57:23.160 --> 57:25.350
Don't go where people know ya.

57:25.400 --> 57:28.200
Well, there you go, you reap what you sow.
