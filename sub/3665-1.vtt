01:27.587 --> 01:29.631
Green onions, please.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.592
- That's $3.
- It's too much!

01:32.592 --> 01:35.637
No way!
It's the cheapest here.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.641
Prices went up.
Don't you know!

01:39.641 --> 01:42.602
- This is dang organic!
- But still!

01:44.646 --> 01:46.648
Think Bok-soon's stupid?

01:47.566 --> 01:49.651
- You got smarter.
- Free cucumber and eggplant.

01:52.612 --> 01:58.660
Bellflower root so white

01:58.660 --> 02:03.665
Crazy bitch
This is deodeok root

02:04.666 --> 02:06.626
Bok-soon's day end sale!

02:06.626 --> 02:07.627
Green onions for $1!

02:07.627 --> 02:08.670
Onions for $1, too!

02:09.588 --> 02:10.630
Cucumbers for $1!

02:10.630 --> 02:12.632
She's napping?

02:17.679 --> 02:20.640
Bok-soon? How are you?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.602
Eun-jung's fine, too?

02:23.602 --> 02:24.686
Poor thing.

02:24.686 --> 02:29.650
Your mom dropped you
when you were a baby.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.611
That's how you got dumb.

02:32.611 --> 02:39.659
Don't go to school.
Work hard and make money.

02:39.659 --> 02:43.663
You have to support
your younger sister, okay?

02:44.664 --> 02:49.669
How can I leave
that slow girl behind?

02:52.631 --> 02:53.673
Bok-soon?

02:53.673 --> 02:57.719
If you miss Granny,
sing this song.

02:57.719 --> 03:02.682
Worm's ribs and virgin balls?
That's crazy bitch

03:02.682 --> 03:06.686
Married daughter becoming a tramp?
That's crazy bitch

03:07.646 --> 03:11.691
Feeding dog food to in-laws?
That's crazy bitch

03:11.691 --> 03:15.695
Crying widow remaining faithful?
That's crazy bitch

03:16.696 --> 03:20.742
Driving a stake into a pumpkin?
That's crazy bitch

03:20.742 --> 03:23.745
- Wondering if...
- Black bean noodles!

03:23.745 --> 03:25.747
- Noodles?
- Yes.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.709
It's so hot.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.755
You owe me $2 from before.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.675
But...

03:38.677 --> 03:42.722
Stop giving me cucumbers.
Pay me money.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.724
- Zucchini, too.
- Noodles, please.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.726
Not that!

03:46.726 --> 03:49.771
I saw Byung-ju working here.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.735
Know how many relatives
work here?

03:55.735 --> 03:59.739
I got distant relatives
and in-laws begging to work.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.790
You built a building?

04:09.749 --> 04:10.792
Yes.

04:11.793 --> 04:16.715
But my small multiplex
won't rent out.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.759
It's hard these days.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.761
Nothing's easy.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.809
Ik-sang?

04:28.727 --> 04:29.728
Yes?

04:29.728 --> 04:33.732
There's this girl
in my factory.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.776
She keeps causing trouble.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.781
Business is hard these days.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.826
I got no choice
but to fire workers.

04:44.826 --> 04:51.791
But she kept protesting
and worked up others.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.836
So I called her to talk.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.797
Told her to stop.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.803
She wouldn't listen.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.851
So I slapped her a few times.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.771
I shouldn't have.

05:14.856 --> 05:18.819
But she filmed it
with her cell phone.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.823
She's threatening me
to spread it.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.868
How much does she want?

05:27.827 --> 05:28.870
$300,000!

05:30.789 --> 05:33.833
$300,000 for a few slaps?

05:43.802 --> 05:45.845
I can't trust just anyone.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.849
Go give her that
and get the phone.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.814
Ik-sang?

05:56.815 --> 05:58.858
You keep in touch with Tae-su?

05:59.859 --> 06:00.860
No.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.905
Something's not right with him.

06:03.905 --> 06:07.909
After he came,
your dad died mysteriously.

06:07.909 --> 06:11.871
Keep your distance.
And don't give him my number.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.877
Where'd you get $300,000
in one day?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.921
That's a lot of money.

06:19.921 --> 06:24.926
Way to go.
Why didn't you pay up earlier?

06:24.926 --> 06:27.929
Guess your wife
can stop working hard.

06:27.929 --> 06:33.852
You're really something.
When you know where she works...

06:46.865 --> 06:47.866
Bro?

06:53.955 --> 06:56.916
The monster hit you again?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.881
Do you...

07:04.883 --> 07:06.926
want me to kill him?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.972
Will you play with me?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.937
Stupid.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.857
How can you kill him?

07:22.984 --> 07:25.862
Get lost!

07:38.958 --> 07:41.961
PESTICIDE

08:32.011 --> 08:33.012
Bro!

08:33.972 --> 08:35.056
Play with me.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.976
You promised!

08:37.976 --> 08:39.060
Bro!

08:39.978 --> 08:43.022
Keep your promise! Bro!

09:47.045 --> 09:52.091
MONSTER

09:52.091 --> 09:55.053
Bok-soon! They're back!

10:00.058 --> 10:01.142
Out of my way!

10:02.060 --> 10:04.062
You bastard!

10:07.065 --> 10:10.109
This is PARK Bok-soon's spot!

10:11.027 --> 10:14.113
- I worked here since I was 10!
- The hell?

10:14.113 --> 10:19.160
- Granny said I could work here!
- Is she retarded?

10:19.160 --> 10:22.163
Why pick on weak people?

10:22.163 --> 10:24.123
You a bastard?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.125
Shit!

10:34.175 --> 10:36.135
Get lost!

10:42.100 --> 10:43.184
Is she okay?

10:52.152 --> 10:54.153
You son of a bitch!

11:06.165 --> 11:07.208
Eun-jung!

11:08.167 --> 11:09.168
Eun-jung!

11:09.168 --> 11:12.171
Sis! What happened
to your face?

11:14.132 --> 11:15.216
I got hit.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.176
Again?

11:18.177 --> 11:22.181
Next time give up the spot.
Don't fight.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.184
But that's my spot.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.146
No, it's not.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.189
It's always been my spot.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.151
There's a landlord.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.195
Granny said it's my land!

11:36.195 --> 11:40.241
You make no sense!
That's why they call you stupid.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.160
Stupid?

11:46.205 --> 11:48.207
Bitch! Forget it!

11:48.207 --> 11:52.253
Drinking from the potty?
That's crazy bitch

11:53.212 --> 11:57.258
Crying widow remaining faithful?
That's crazy bitch

11:57.258 --> 12:02.221
Always troubled and worried?
That's crazy bitch

12:02.221 --> 12:06.225
Pooping in the veggie field?
That's crazy bitch

12:14.233 --> 12:17.195
Bro?
It's been a long time.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.282
Why?

12:24.202 --> 12:25.244
About what?

12:30.208 --> 12:32.210
Text the address.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.219
Ah, Tae-su?

12:42.303 --> 12:45.264
I got a favor to ask.

12:47.266 --> 12:51.270
Some girl won't handover
a cell phone.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.232
Cut it out!

12:57.235 --> 13:00.238
She's a rotten bitch.

13:01.280 --> 13:07.286
Takes candid shots with her phone
and blackmails people.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.330
For money.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.335
Can you get it from her?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.302
It's important.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.304
Do me a favor.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.308
How?

13:30.268 --> 13:32.270
What do you mean?

13:33.271 --> 13:35.273
How do you want it done?

13:41.279 --> 13:46.284
If it's you,
won't she hand it over?

13:48.327 --> 13:49.370
Why me?

13:51.372 --> 13:54.333
Do this for me.

13:57.336 --> 14:02.341
You change numbers, move,
and suddenly call in 5 years.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.344
What the hell?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.306
Right.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.313
I'm sorry.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.357
Forget I asked.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.362
Damn bastards are fuckin' loud.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.330
Want me to kill 'em?

14:37.376 --> 14:40.379
Damn bastards are fuckin' loud!

14:43.424 --> 14:45.343
Hey!

14:46.385 --> 14:50.389
Mister, he's just kidding.

14:51.432 --> 14:55.353
Calm down, Mister.
He's kidding.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.404
Mister! He's just goofing.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.450
Just forget it and go.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.410
He was just kidding!

15:44.402 --> 15:45.486
How's Mom?

15:45.486 --> 15:47.446
She's good.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.454
Buy her some vitamins.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.500
Okay. Thanks.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.422
- The address?
- Here.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.477
Where's your sister?

16:19.437 --> 16:20.479
I don't know.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.523
Why don't you ever know?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.485
I don't know.

16:26.485 --> 16:30.489
Then, make sure you give her
my message.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.534
If she doesn't pay up soon...

16:34.493 --> 16:36.537
I'll have to evict you.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.540
Understand me?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.541
Yes.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.544
Damn it.

16:43.544 --> 16:47.465
Damn bums causing me headaches!

16:51.510 --> 16:53.554
Why're you glaring?

16:54.513 --> 16:56.474
Cut it out!

16:58.476 --> 16:59.518
Stop it!

17:03.522 --> 17:08.527
Damn.
Such good manners.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.583
If we don't pay soon,
we'll be evicted.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.587
Who cares?
I could buy this house.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.547
With what money?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.594
Nari?

17:33.594 --> 17:36.597
Say three things
you want to have.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.602
Raise a dog and live with you
in our own house.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.604
That's it?

17:44.563 --> 17:46.566
Fine. You got your wish.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.567
Really?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.528
Ever seen me lie before?

17:50.528 --> 17:51.570
Of course.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.656
This is for real.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.617
I found our house.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.618
You'll really buy it?

17:58.577 --> 17:59.620
Yes, I will!

18:00.579 --> 18:01.622
Wanna go buy a dog?

18:02.540 --> 18:03.541
Really?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.628
Didn't she go?

18:07.628 --> 18:09.588
She did.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.637
Yeon-hee?

18:16.637 --> 18:18.597
Yes.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.599
I came to get the phone.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.644
Where's the money?

18:24.603 --> 18:25.646
What money?

18:26.564 --> 18:28.607
Boss sent you empty handed?

18:28.607 --> 18:31.569
Like the man
who came yesterday?

18:31.569 --> 18:35.656
Forget the money.
Just give me the phone, please.

18:35.656 --> 18:36.657
Go, please.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.660
Let go!

18:41.620 --> 18:42.663
Yeon-hee?

18:43.622 --> 18:46.667
If you close the gate,
you'll die.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.688
Where's your mom?

19:50.648 --> 19:51.690
I don't have one.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.693
It's just you two?

19:54.693 --> 19:55.736
Yes.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.755
What'd you do with
the money?

20:16.674 --> 20:17.758
I took it. So what?

20:18.759 --> 20:22.721
I can't even afford to pay
for my son's studies!

20:23.681 --> 20:24.765
Know what my wife does?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.726
She works at a hostess bar!

20:27.726 --> 20:31.731
I found out 3 months ago,
but pretend I don't know!

20:31.731 --> 20:33.691
Damn it!

20:33.691 --> 20:37.695
Stop whining, bro.
Things got messy cuz of you.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.738
- Hey!
- I'll be waiting.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.741
Wait! Listen!

20:41.741 --> 20:42.783
Tae-su!

20:46.787 --> 20:48.789
GENUINE POTTERY 2KM

21:56.774 --> 21:58.776
Let's do this.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.821
I'll give you a chance.

22:03.822 --> 22:07.826
You can run away
until I'm done drinking this.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.830
But if you get caught,
you die.

22:13.874 --> 22:18.837
If you ask people for help,
I'll kill them, too.

22:20.798 --> 22:23.801
So don't grab just anyone
for help.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.846
Find someone stronger than me.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.890
Someone I can't kill.

22:36.814 --> 22:37.856
Can you run fast?

22:41.819 --> 22:42.861
Begin.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.960
Aren't you eating?

23:41.879 --> 23:42.921
I'm not.

23:44.923 --> 23:45.924
Sis?

23:46.925 --> 23:50.971
I have to go to Seoul University
to make lots of money.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.974
People slight us
cuz we're poor.

23:53.974 --> 23:57.895
Let's make lots of money
and live it up.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.942
I'm going with you.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.944
But I'll live in a dorm.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.947
I'll live there, too!

24:09.990 --> 24:11.950
You can't.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.954
Why not?

24:15.954 --> 24:17.956
You just can't.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.958
I'll cook and clean.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.005
I'll cook. I'll clean.

24:26.924 --> 24:29.009
And I'll sell veggies for money.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.970
Please, Eun-jung?

24:33.931 --> 24:36.016
Let's live in the dorm together!

24:38.936 --> 24:40.938
Please?

24:44.942 --> 24:45.984
Eun-jung!

24:46.944 --> 24:49.947
I can't live without you!

24:49.947 --> 24:54.993
Let's live together!
That's my wish for life!

24:54.993 --> 24:56.036
Stop it!

25:02.000 --> 25:03.961
You bitch!

25:08.048 --> 25:10.008
- It hurts!
- You bitch!

25:10.008 --> 25:12.052
Calm down!

25:12.052 --> 25:13.971
Let go!

25:13.971 --> 25:16.014
If I let go, you'll hit me.

25:24.982 --> 25:25.983
Eun-jung!

25:25.983 --> 25:27.985
I love you.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.048
Have some. It's good.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.053
Where are you from?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.098
Are you lost?

25:58.098 --> 26:00.100
Where are your parents?

26:03.103 --> 26:06.023
Maybe she can't talk.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.072
I'm her older sister.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.117
I'm PARK Bok-soon.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.081
Got a sister, too?

26:26.126 --> 26:28.086
Where is she?

26:32.049 --> 26:33.091
Don't cry.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.053
I'll find your sister.

26:38.096 --> 26:41.099
I'm good at finding people.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.113
Sis?

26:57.115 --> 26:58.158
I gotta pee.

27:02.162 --> 27:05.082
I've outgrown that.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.172
What's that?

27:13.131 --> 27:15.092
She came here today.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.179
Oh, right! I forgot.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.140
This is why
we can't live together.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.102
- Smarten up!
- Okay.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.161
2 X 7 = 14!

27:43.161 --> 27:45.163
2 X 8 = 16!

27:45.163 --> 27:47.165
2 X 9...

27:47.165 --> 27:48.166
2 X 9...

27:48.166 --> 27:50.168
- Eat! Past tense!
- Eat?

27:50.168 --> 27:53.171
- Oh! 18!
- Right!

27:54.214 --> 27:58.135
The police will help you.
Don't worry.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.179
My gym clothes!

28:01.179 --> 28:02.180
Sis...

28:03.140 --> 28:06.143
Why won't you ever listen!

28:07.185 --> 28:09.187
- Go ahead!
- Okay.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.148
Let's go.

30:46.303 --> 30:47.345
Eun-jung!

30:48.346 --> 30:52.309
I'll call for the hospital car.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.396
I'll bring you back alive.
Okay?

30:56.396 --> 30:58.315
Wait!

31:23.381 --> 31:25.425
Damn lousy weather.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.387
Why do you need him?

31:30.347 --> 31:31.389
I just do.

31:33.350 --> 31:36.394
Tell me why and how
you need to use him.

31:37.354 --> 31:40.357
If you're just scaring,
take someone else.

31:44.444 --> 31:47.364
- That's him?
- Yup.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.369
Got a screw loose?

31:54.454 --> 31:56.414
Hey!

31:57.415 --> 31:58.416
Hey!

31:59.376 --> 32:00.460
Come down fool!

32:01.378 --> 32:02.462
Get down!

32:03.421 --> 32:05.423
Come here!

32:06.383 --> 32:07.425
Come here!

32:07.425 --> 32:09.427
That bastard!

32:13.431 --> 32:15.392
It's important.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.477
Is he good?

32:21.398 --> 32:24.442
He's North Korean.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.404
Know the North Korean
Defense Guards?

32:27.404 --> 32:29.406
He's from there.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.493
He's got a deadly move.

32:33.493 --> 32:37.497
He sticks out his hand.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.458
And strikes the stomach.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.503
He pokes right through
the stomach.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.464
Really! Right up to here.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.508
After he's in, then what?

32:48.508 --> 32:50.468
He pushes up.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.512
Then, he grabs things in there!

32:52.512 --> 32:53.513
Pulls it out!

32:53.513 --> 32:56.474
Then, guts spill out all over.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.476
Dang brutal!

33:01.438 --> 33:02.522
That's him!

33:05.442 --> 33:07.444
Hey, fool!

33:08.486 --> 33:10.447
Come here and say hi.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.492
Eun-jung!

33:18.455 --> 33:21.499
- It was here.
- Remember what he looks like?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.502
Yes. I saw him!

33:24.502 --> 33:26.546
How tall is he?

33:26.546 --> 33:29.507
He's tall! Really!

33:29.507 --> 33:31.468
How tall?

33:33.470 --> 33:34.554
2 meters?

33:34.554 --> 33:36.556
2 meters?

33:38.475 --> 33:41.478
His face?
What does he look like?

33:43.480 --> 33:45.482
He's good looking.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.526
Oh, he's good looking?

33:49.486 --> 33:53.490
So you killed a good looking
2 meter tall guy with a rock?

33:54.491 --> 33:55.575
Yes!

33:55.575 --> 33:58.536
How many times
did I tell you?

34:00.538 --> 34:04.501
You reported her
running away before.

34:07.504 --> 34:09.589
We fought about her going
to Seoul.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.549
You had a fight?

34:11.549 --> 34:13.551
Eun-jung is a good girl!

34:13.551 --> 34:17.555
Good kids get more stressed
and run away.

34:17.555 --> 34:20.600
I ran away recently
and almost got killed.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.562
- He killed her! Like this!
- Why you!

34:26.523 --> 34:30.568
Sometimes they fake their deaths
and run away.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.570
To hurt their family more.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.532
Kids these days are so cunning.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.537
If she doesn't come tomorrow,
I'll report her missing.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.623
You're leaving?

34:43.623 --> 34:45.625
Just go home.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.585
Go home?

34:47.585 --> 34:50.547
- Go home and eat.
- Eat?

34:51.589 --> 34:54.551
I'm not hungry!

34:57.595 --> 35:00.557
Got fools like him back home?

35:07.605 --> 35:09.566
Ever killed anyone?

35:14.571 --> 35:15.613
Forget it.

35:16.698 --> 35:18.658
Never mind!

35:25.665 --> 35:29.586
I'm not telling you
to kill him.

35:30.629 --> 35:34.674
You just have to help me
if I fall in danger.

35:36.634 --> 35:42.640
But there's a kiln here.
So you can burn up corpses.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.603
No one will ever know.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.671
Count it later.

36:14.631 --> 36:15.673
Hey!

36:27.685 --> 36:31.689
Were you really
a defense guard?

36:34.692 --> 36:37.654
Not just a clerk?

36:52.752 --> 36:53.753
Hey!

36:55.755 --> 36:57.757
Shit!

36:57.757 --> 36:58.758
Hey!

37:21.781 --> 37:22.782
You came?

37:22.782 --> 37:25.785
You told me to come, so I did.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.787
Where'd you go?

37:27.787 --> 37:29.789
To find the kid.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.791
What kid?

37:32.792 --> 37:35.795
There was a kid at her house.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.797
Where's the kid now?

37:38.798 --> 37:40.800
She ran away.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.765
She's clever.
Never seen a kid like her.

37:46.765 --> 37:50.768
- But it's funny a how a girl...
- It's funny?

37:50.768 --> 37:53.772
Know what'll happen
if she talks?

37:53.772 --> 37:55.732
I'll find her.

37:55.732 --> 37:58.735
- Got the phone?
- No.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.779
- Did you look?
- Yes.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.825
It's important.
I have to get it!

38:06.784 --> 38:07.827
It's not at her house.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.831
Then, she must've hid it
somewhere else.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.792
Probably.

38:13.792 --> 38:14.834
The hell!

38:15.752 --> 38:17.837
Why'd you kill her
without finding it!

38:23.760 --> 38:24.803
Who's the fool?

38:32.810 --> 38:34.812
He can't come here.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.774
Why'd you bring him?

38:38.816 --> 38:39.817
He's a friend.

38:40.777 --> 38:42.779
Why'd you bring him then?

38:45.823 --> 38:46.866
You scared of me?

38:47.825 --> 38:48.868
Fuck you! Bastard!

41:26.943 --> 41:27.986
Shit!

42:14.031 --> 42:15.992
Forget it.

42:18.077 --> 42:22.039
How about dinner with Mom?

42:23.082 --> 42:24.083
Why not?

42:25.042 --> 42:27.086
Wait. I'll wash up.

43:08.085 --> 43:09.128
Here.

43:09.128 --> 43:11.088
Buy some vitamins.

43:11.088 --> 43:16.052
Again?
When you always wire me money...

43:22.141 --> 43:24.143
You must make a lot.

43:25.144 --> 43:27.104
My pottery sells well.

43:27.104 --> 43:29.106
That's great!

43:29.106 --> 43:32.109
Want Mom to manage
the money for you?

43:34.111 --> 43:37.073
So, Jung-woo is smart?

43:39.116 --> 43:41.160
Sort of.

43:41.160 --> 43:44.163
He wants to study law.
He's the school's top student.

43:46.165 --> 43:48.167
A judge in our family?

43:48.167 --> 43:50.169
They don't all become judges.

43:50.169 --> 43:53.130
Still, he's really smart.

43:53.130 --> 43:56.175
He doesn't even need tutoring.

43:57.134 --> 44:00.137
- If he becomes a judge...
- He's not!

44:10.106 --> 44:11.107
Mom?

44:12.108 --> 44:13.067
Yes.

44:14.110 --> 44:17.154
Remember locking me up
when I was seven?

44:19.156 --> 44:20.199
Me?

44:21.158 --> 44:23.202
Cuz money kept disappearing.

44:25.121 --> 44:27.164
You stripped me
and locked me...

44:27.164 --> 44:30.126
for three days. Remember?

44:31.169 --> 44:35.214
Ik-sang's the one who stole.

44:40.136 --> 44:41.137
Why you!

44:41.137 --> 44:43.180
What a great memory.

44:43.180 --> 44:45.182
Still remember that?

44:57.153 --> 44:59.155
Give it to Jung-woo.

45:13.252 --> 45:15.212
That son of a bitch!

45:15.212 --> 45:18.215
Calm down, son!
Stop!

45:18.215 --> 45:20.217
Let go!

45:20.217 --> 45:23.220
You bastard! Come here!

45:23.220 --> 45:24.221
Son of a bitch!

45:24.221 --> 45:27.266
Is there warranty on this?

46:05.221 --> 46:07.223
She's over there?

46:11.310 --> 46:13.229
Eun-jung!

46:14.271 --> 46:16.273
Shit!

46:17.233 --> 46:20.236
Damn granny!
She's not here!

46:21.278 --> 46:23.239
Eun-jung!

46:24.281 --> 46:25.324
Eun-jung!

46:26.283 --> 46:29.245
Eun-jung...

46:32.289 --> 46:35.292
Eun-jung!

46:35.292 --> 46:37.336
Where were you?

46:37.336 --> 46:40.297
I looked everywhere!

46:40.297 --> 46:42.341
Where were you?

46:42.341 --> 46:44.301
Eun-jung!

46:45.261 --> 46:47.346
Sis? I'm dead.

47:03.279 --> 47:05.322
Where's Eun-jung?

47:07.366 --> 47:09.368
Where is she!

47:11.370 --> 47:14.373
Where's Eun-jung?
Did you see?

47:20.296 --> 47:21.380
Oh no...

47:21.380 --> 47:25.384
Eun-jung is gone!

47:25.384 --> 47:29.305
I can't find her anywhere!

47:30.389 --> 47:33.392
That bastard...

47:39.315 --> 47:41.358
He's your dad isn't he?

47:41.358 --> 47:43.319
Right?

47:44.278 --> 47:45.362
He's your dad!

47:45.362 --> 47:47.406
He's your dad, right?

47:47.406 --> 47:49.408
He's your dad isn't he!

47:50.367 --> 47:52.411
He's your dad! Say it!

47:53.329 --> 47:55.414
Where's your dad?

47:55.414 --> 47:57.416
Where's your dad!

47:58.334 --> 48:00.419
Tell me!
Where's your dad?

48:00.419 --> 48:03.380
He killed my sister, too.

48:03.380 --> 48:06.383
When I came to,
I was at his house.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.427
He said I can run away,
so I did.

48:09.345 --> 48:13.432
He chased me
and I ran away scared.

48:14.433 --> 48:16.393
I'm sorry.

48:17.353 --> 48:19.396
I'm so sorry.

48:25.402 --> 48:28.364
Know where to find him?

48:31.408 --> 48:34.411
Can you tell me?

48:40.417 --> 48:43.379
Eun-jung must be dead.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.423
She can't die...

48:47.424 --> 48:49.385
Eun-jung...

49:29.425 --> 49:30.509
PARK EUN-JUNG

49:55.492 --> 49:57.536
If you eat this, you die?

50:00.497 --> 50:02.541
How do they die?

50:06.462 --> 50:07.546
Did you see?

50:18.515 --> 50:20.517
Did you feed it to him?

50:45.501 --> 50:47.544
Take that! You bastard!

50:55.552 --> 50:57.554
Let's try again.

50:59.598 --> 51:01.600
Take that! Bastard!

51:02.559 --> 51:04.520
Take that! Bastard!

51:05.604 --> 51:08.524
Take that! Bastard!

51:18.575 --> 51:19.618
Water.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.557
Let's go.

52:00.617 --> 52:02.661
Why do they sleep there?

52:03.620 --> 52:06.665
They must not have a house.

52:07.624 --> 52:08.625
Right.

52:46.705 --> 52:47.706
Hey!

52:48.707 --> 52:50.709
You sure it's this way?

52:50.709 --> 52:52.711
How much longer?

52:53.712 --> 52:56.673
I think it's down this way.

52:57.674 --> 52:59.676
You always say that.

52:59.676 --> 53:01.720
If you lie, I'll get you!

53:15.609 --> 53:16.693
Hey!

53:17.653 --> 53:19.655
Where are we going?

53:25.702 --> 53:28.705
I'm sorry. I don't know.

53:31.708 --> 53:32.751
You said you did!

53:32.751 --> 53:35.712
I'm sorry. I can't remember.

53:35.712 --> 53:36.713
I'm sorry.

53:37.673 --> 53:39.716
Then, you lied to me?

53:41.718 --> 53:44.680
I told you if you lie,
I'll get you!

53:47.766 --> 53:51.728
- You liar! You liar!
- It's that way!

53:51.728 --> 53:53.730
It's not a lie!

53:53.730 --> 53:55.732
- You liar!
- No...

53:56.692 --> 53:57.734
I'm not lying!

53:57.734 --> 53:58.735
I'm not!

53:58.735 --> 54:01.738
Eun-jung's gone cuz of you!

54:03.782 --> 54:05.784
- I'm sorry.
- Why'd you come!

54:06.743 --> 54:09.788
Where's Eun-jung!
Bring Eun-jung back!

54:20.757 --> 54:21.800
Does it hurt?

54:28.765 --> 54:30.809
Want some ointment?

54:37.774 --> 54:40.736
I'm sorry I hit you.

54:42.738 --> 54:43.780
Don't cry!

54:46.825 --> 54:49.828
Bok-soon was bad.

54:49.828 --> 54:51.830
No, you're not.

54:51.830 --> 54:53.832
I must be stupid.

54:53.832 --> 54:55.792
You're not!

54:56.752 --> 54:58.795
I was so bad.

54:58.795 --> 55:01.798
I'm sorry, sweetie!

55:04.760 --> 55:09.806
I'll give you gum.
Peach flavor.

55:10.807 --> 55:12.851
It's my favorite.

55:12.851 --> 55:15.812
Thank you, Bok-soon.

55:15.812 --> 55:19.775
I'm so sorry about before!

55:39.795 --> 55:41.880
Ever licked a snake before?

55:41.880 --> 55:42.881
No.

55:43.882 --> 55:45.801
I did.

55:46.802 --> 55:48.804
Why'd you lick a snake?

55:49.846 --> 55:53.850
Eun-jung told me to,
so I did.

55:55.811 --> 55:56.812
Bitch.

55:58.897 --> 56:00.857
What's your name?

56:00.857 --> 56:02.859
Nari. GAE Nari.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.821
Like the flower?

56:06.863 --> 56:09.866
Gae nari the flower

56:11.827 --> 56:13.912
Something like that

56:13.912 --> 56:15.914
That's not it.

56:15.914 --> 56:18.917
Your last name's GAE?

56:18.917 --> 56:20.877
GAE Nari.

56:28.885 --> 56:29.928
That's it?

56:32.848 --> 56:33.890
Bok-soon!

56:35.934 --> 56:37.853
Bok-soon!

56:55.912 --> 56:57.873
Shit! I'm stuck!

56:58.874 --> 57:01.960
Ow! That hurts!

58:51.027 --> 58:53.071
PARK EUN-JUNG

1:00:20.075 --> 1:00:21.159
Bok-soon!

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:23.119
Bok-soon!

1:00:23.119 --> 1:00:24.162
He's coming!

1:02:41.216 --> 1:02:42.300
Wanna live?

1:02:43.301 --> 1:02:46.221
That's what they all say.

1:02:48.264 --> 1:02:50.225
Don't kill me, Mister.

1:02:50.225 --> 1:02:51.309
Don't kill me!

1:02:51.309 --> 1:02:53.311
I know where the phone is!

1:02:56.231 --> 1:02:58.274
Bro? I found it.

1:03:00.235 --> 1:03:02.278
Be patient!

1:03:02.278 --> 1:03:05.323
No, I'll bring it to you.

1:03:05.323 --> 1:03:08.326
I'll call when I get there.

1:03:14.332 --> 1:03:16.334
Are you caught?

1:03:17.293 --> 1:03:18.336
Oh no!

1:03:19.337 --> 1:03:22.257
Want my help?

1:03:23.258 --> 1:03:25.343
Then, will you be
my little sister?

1:03:27.303 --> 1:03:29.305
Let's run away! Hurry!

1:03:33.268 --> 1:03:34.269
Let's go.

1:04:38.416 --> 1:04:41.377
Don't you just want to kill 'em?

1:04:44.422 --> 1:04:46.424
Want me to?

1:04:48.343 --> 1:04:49.385
No...

1:05:17.413 --> 1:05:19.415
Enter the secret code.

1:05:20.375 --> 1:05:21.459
Locker is opened.

1:05:31.469 --> 1:05:33.429
We're here.

1:05:34.389 --> 1:05:35.473
- We're here?
- Yes.

1:05:37.392 --> 1:05:38.434
How much?

1:05:39.477 --> 1:05:41.437
This should do.

1:05:42.397 --> 1:05:43.481
Why's it so expensive?

1:05:44.399 --> 1:05:45.441
It just is.

1:05:46.401 --> 1:05:47.443
Get off.

1:05:47.443 --> 1:05:49.404
Son of a bitch!

1:05:50.405 --> 1:05:53.449
- Why you!
- I'll let you off cuz I'm busy!

1:05:57.453 --> 1:06:00.456
Do you know GAE Nari?

1:06:00.456 --> 1:06:02.500
- Her last name's GAE.
- I don't know.

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.460
Don't know?

1:06:06.504 --> 1:06:10.425
- Do You know GAE Nari?
- No.

1:06:10.425 --> 1:06:13.428
- Has hair like me and this tall.
- Don't know.

1:06:14.429 --> 1:06:15.513
Nari...

1:06:18.474 --> 1:06:23.438
Nari said to come
to Jong-gak Station...

1:06:42.498 --> 1:06:44.542
Good work.
See you next time.

1:06:45.501 --> 1:06:46.544
Bro.

1:06:46.544 --> 1:06:48.546
Let's go see Mom.

1:06:49.547 --> 1:06:51.507
Why?

1:06:51.507 --> 1:06:54.510
How about a drink
with just our family?

1:06:56.512 --> 1:07:01.559
With mom's spicy skate fish.
It's been a while.

1:07:01.559 --> 1:07:03.519
What about the kid?

1:07:03.519 --> 1:07:05.521
Lock her in the car.

1:07:07.523 --> 1:07:12.528
But I gotta deliver this quick.
See you next time.

1:07:12.528 --> 1:07:14.530
Go. I can wait.

1:07:17.533 --> 1:07:19.535
Don't. Next time.

1:07:20.536 --> 1:07:22.580
I'm here. Make that now.

1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:29.545
It'll take a long time.
See you next time.

1:07:51.567 --> 1:07:53.528
Next time, when?

1:07:53.528 --> 1:07:54.570
I'll call you.

1:07:55.530 --> 1:07:57.532
No, you won't.

1:08:00.576 --> 1:08:03.579
Am I begging you here?

1:08:04.580 --> 1:08:05.623
I'm sorry.

1:08:06.582 --> 1:08:08.626
Sorry for what?

1:08:08.626 --> 1:08:12.547
I'm asking you!
What are you sorry for?

1:08:23.599 --> 1:08:25.601
GAE Nari!

1:08:28.563 --> 1:08:30.565
Nari!

1:08:32.567 --> 1:08:33.609

1:08:35.570 --> 1:08:36.654
GAE Nari!

1:08:50.626 --> 1:08:51.669
Nari!

1:08:57.592 --> 1:08:58.634
Nari!

1:09:37.673 --> 1:09:39.634
Help us!

1:09:40.718 --> 1:09:42.637
Who're you?

1:10:07.704 --> 1:10:09.747
I'll pay $1,000 per hit.

1:10:09.747 --> 1:10:10.748
Sign it.

1:10:11.749 --> 1:10:14.752
You can make $100 grand!

1:10:14.752 --> 1:10:17.713
Get slapped for this much?
I'd do it!

1:10:17.713 --> 1:10:18.756
See!

1:10:22.718 --> 1:10:25.722
What'll it be?
Get hit or get lost!

1:10:26.681 --> 1:10:27.723
Protest all you want!

1:10:28.683 --> 1:10:30.726
You'll never work again
in my factory!

1:10:30.726 --> 1:10:31.769
You have a sister?

1:10:31.769 --> 1:10:35.731
She'll end up worthless
like you!

1:10:38.693 --> 1:10:39.694
Here.

1:10:40.736 --> 1:10:41.779
Go!

1:10:43.698 --> 1:10:44.740
Get lost!

1:10:51.706 --> 1:10:52.790
I'll do it.

1:11:09.724 --> 1:11:10.767
Good!

1:11:11.767 --> 1:11:13.728
You're dead!

1:11:17.815 --> 1:11:19.734
$1,000!

1:11:19.734 --> 1:11:20.776
Get up!

1:11:20.776 --> 1:11:22.737

1:11:37.752 --> 1:11:39.837
Please stop!

1:11:39.837 --> 1:11:41.798
Stop?

1:11:41.798 --> 1:11:44.800
You're getting paid!
Come back!

1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:49.805
Enough with your protests!

1:11:49.805 --> 1:11:52.767
Know how I built this company?

1:11:53.809 --> 1:11:55.811
Like it? Huh?

1:11:59.774 --> 1:12:00.816
Like it?

1:12:01.817 --> 1:12:03.861
I like it, too! Bitch!

1:12:08.825 --> 1:12:10.868
Why didn't you answer
your phone!

1:12:10.868 --> 1:12:12.829
Sorry, it's taking me long.

1:12:12.829 --> 1:12:13.871
What about the phone?

1:12:15.790 --> 1:12:16.791
Bring it to me now!

1:12:16.791 --> 1:12:18.876
But I gotta go see Mom.

1:12:18.876 --> 1:12:20.836
Come to her shop.

1:12:20.836 --> 1:12:21.838
What?

1:12:21.838 --> 1:12:23.881
Come over and let's talk.

1:12:26.801 --> 1:12:28.886
Things are really hard for her.

1:12:29.845 --> 1:12:32.890
Hope you see that, Uncle.

1:12:32.890 --> 1:12:34.892
We're family, too.

1:12:34.892 --> 1:12:35.893
You bastard!

1:12:35.893 --> 1:12:37.853
I saw the video.

1:12:41.857 --> 1:12:42.858
I'm busy.

1:12:42.858 --> 1:12:44.902
Come even if it's late.

1:12:44.902 --> 1:12:46.821
I'll be waiting.

1:12:48.823 --> 1:12:49.865
Fine then.

1:12:54.870 --> 1:12:56.914
SUBSTATION RELOCATED

1:13:10.845 --> 1:13:12.888
Let's just go!

1:13:12.888 --> 1:13:15.892
If we wait, they'll come.

1:13:16.851 --> 1:13:18.894
They moved somewhere else!

1:13:19.896 --> 1:13:23.900
'Relocate' means to wait!
Don't you know?

1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:26.861
Please!

1:13:26.861 --> 1:13:28.863
Let's go to the police.

1:13:28.863 --> 1:13:30.906
Cops don't believe me!

1:14:17.954 --> 1:14:19.955
Bok-soon! Let's go!

1:14:22.958 --> 1:14:24.001
Let's go!

1:14:47.942 --> 1:14:49.944
What would you like?

1:14:51.987 --> 1:14:52.988
Ma'am?

1:14:53.948 --> 1:14:57.994
If I eat without paying,
I'll go to jail, right?

1:14:57.994 --> 1:14:59.995
Of course you will!

1:15:00.996 --> 1:15:02.957
Scram!

1:15:07.962 --> 1:15:10.005
Who said I had no money?

1:15:15.970 --> 1:15:20.015
- When she looks so nice...
- She doesn't at all!

1:15:20.015 --> 1:15:22.977
I'm starving!

1:15:33.028 --> 1:15:35.072
Hey! What did you do?

1:15:36.073 --> 1:15:39.034
He's been waiting for hours.

1:15:49.086 --> 1:15:53.090
If you took my boy,
shouldn't you call?

1:15:54.091 --> 1:15:57.052
You won't pick up your phone.

1:15:58.095 --> 1:16:00.097
Things aren't good.

1:16:02.016 --> 1:16:04.101
Me and the boys
were gonna go over.

1:16:05.019 --> 1:16:06.103
But your wife would freak.

1:16:07.062 --> 1:16:09.064
So we came here.

1:16:09.064 --> 1:16:10.107
Good.

1:16:11.108 --> 1:16:14.028
She would've fainted.

1:16:16.030 --> 1:16:17.114
Where's my boy?

1:16:21.076 --> 1:16:24.121
I'm asking you
what happened, bro!

1:16:26.081 --> 1:16:29.043
Listen to me, man!

1:16:31.086 --> 1:16:33.088
How big is your place?

1:16:33.088 --> 1:16:34.089
What?

1:16:36.050 --> 1:16:37.092
It's 1100ft².

1:16:37.092 --> 1:16:38.135
Mine's 800ft².

1:16:38.135 --> 1:16:40.054
But I'm renting.

1:16:40.054 --> 1:16:41.138
Mine's a sublet!

1:16:44.099 --> 1:16:46.060
So what?

1:16:48.103 --> 1:16:50.064
Gwang-su...

1:16:51.106 --> 1:16:53.067
Help me out.

1:17:08.123 --> 1:17:09.166
Are you hurt?

1:17:09.166 --> 1:17:11.126
I'm hungry!

1:17:14.129 --> 1:17:17.174
Hang in there.
We're almost there.

1:17:17.174 --> 1:17:20.135
Why do you always say that?

1:17:20.135 --> 1:17:22.096
You lie...

1:17:24.098 --> 1:17:26.141
I'm so hungry.

1:17:26.141 --> 1:17:29.186
I can't do anything
if I'm hungry.

1:17:30.146 --> 1:17:33.107
Shouldn't adults bear it?

1:17:34.108 --> 1:17:36.110
Adults get hungry, too!

1:17:37.152 --> 1:17:41.156
I've never been so hungry
in my life.

1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:48.122
I'm not going!

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:53.210
Then, wait here.

1:18:35.169 --> 1:18:36.211
Bok-soon?

1:18:39.256 --> 1:18:41.217
Bok-soon!

1:18:45.220 --> 1:18:47.181
Sis?

1:18:49.224 --> 1:18:51.226
Bok-soon!

1:18:54.188 --> 1:18:55.231
Sis...

1:18:58.233 --> 1:19:00.235
GAE Nari!

1:19:03.197 --> 1:19:05.240
Where'd you go?

1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:06.283
Where'd you go?

1:19:07.201 --> 1:19:08.285
You bitch!

1:19:09.244 --> 1:19:11.288
- I looked for you!
- I looked for you more!

1:19:12.247 --> 1:19:13.290
I told you to stay!

1:19:14.249 --> 1:19:16.293
I thought he got you!

1:19:16.293 --> 1:19:18.295
I thought he got you, too!

1:19:18.295 --> 1:19:21.298
It's dangerous! Why go off?

1:19:21.298 --> 1:19:23.258
It's dangerous for you, too.

1:19:23.258 --> 1:19:25.302
But I'm fast!

1:19:25.302 --> 1:19:26.303
I won't get caught!

1:19:26.303 --> 1:19:28.305
I'm fast, too!

1:19:30.265 --> 1:19:31.308
Okay...

1:19:34.269 --> 1:19:37.272
So let's not split up again!

1:19:38.273 --> 1:19:41.318
Okay! Let's stay together!

1:20:04.341 --> 1:20:06.302
Nari?

1:20:06.302 --> 1:20:08.345
What's your favorite food?

1:20:08.345 --> 1:20:11.306
I love black bean noodles.

1:20:11.306 --> 1:20:13.267
I love noodles with beef.

1:20:14.309 --> 1:20:16.353
You must've been rich!

1:20:16.353 --> 1:20:20.274
No. Just order extra large
and share.

1:20:24.278 --> 1:20:25.320
Right...

1:20:32.327 --> 1:20:34.288
I was thinking...

1:20:35.372 --> 1:20:38.375
Wanna live with me
at my house?

1:20:40.377 --> 1:20:44.339
I'll send you to school
and make you food.

1:20:45.382 --> 1:20:49.303
I'm a good cook you know.

1:20:55.392 --> 1:20:57.394
Don't want to?

1:21:17.414 --> 1:21:21.376
Come by mom's shop.
Let’s have drinks.

1:21:22.378 --> 1:21:24.379
Suddenly why?

1:21:24.379 --> 1:21:27.424
I got something to say.

1:21:27.424 --> 1:21:29.384
What?

1:21:31.387 --> 1:21:33.347
Say what?

1:21:34.348 --> 1:21:35.432
Here's Mom.

1:21:39.353 --> 1:21:41.396
- Hi, Tae-su.
- Hi.

1:21:41.396 --> 1:21:43.440
You wanted spicy skate?

1:21:44.358 --> 1:21:46.360
I have some.

1:21:47.319 --> 1:21:50.405
It's really fresh
from Jeju Island.

1:21:51.406 --> 1:21:54.409
Why don't the three of us
have a few drinks together?

1:21:55.410 --> 1:21:58.455
There's so much
Mom's sorry to you for.

1:22:00.457 --> 1:22:02.418
Sorry for what?

1:22:03.418 --> 1:22:05.420
Want your brother on?

1:22:06.421 --> 1:22:08.423
No. It's okay.

1:22:10.384 --> 1:22:12.386
- Mom.
- Hmm?

1:22:14.429 --> 1:22:17.391
- Really wanna see me?
- Yes.

1:22:18.433 --> 1:22:20.436
I'm family too, right?

1:22:20.436 --> 1:22:22.479
Of course. Come quick.

1:22:24.481 --> 1:22:27.401
I'll be right there.

1:22:32.406 --> 1:22:34.491
What are you doing!
Bastard!

1:22:34.491 --> 1:22:36.451
I'll take care of it, Mom.

1:22:36.451 --> 1:22:38.495
Just get the spicy skate ready.

1:23:03.437 --> 1:23:04.521
I'll borrow this, ma'am.

1:23:05.439 --> 1:23:08.483
- Don't fight. Just talk! Okay?
- Yes.

1:23:09.443 --> 1:23:10.485
Sir!

1:23:11.528 --> 1:23:13.488
I'll cut his throat!

1:23:13.488 --> 1:23:15.490
And get blood all over here?

1:23:16.533 --> 1:23:18.535
I'll end him with this!

1:23:19.536 --> 1:23:20.537
You crazy!

1:23:21.455 --> 1:23:23.540
Then, I'll cut his throat
with this!

1:23:24.541 --> 1:23:26.501
Blood! You fool!

1:23:27.544 --> 1:23:29.546
I'll cut his artery.

1:23:30.505 --> 1:23:32.549
I said no blood fool!

1:23:44.561 --> 1:23:46.521
What's he saying?

1:23:54.488 --> 1:23:55.530
Son of a bitch!

1:23:55.530 --> 1:23:58.575
Come here!
Let go! Bastard!

1:23:58.575 --> 1:24:00.494
Come here!

1:24:10.587 --> 1:24:13.507
You don't have parents?

1:24:14.508 --> 1:24:15.550
No.

1:24:16.593 --> 1:24:18.553
I don't either.

1:24:19.513 --> 1:24:20.555
How old are you?

1:24:21.515 --> 1:24:22.557
I'm 10.

1:24:22.557 --> 1:24:24.559
Eun-jung is 19!

1:24:24.559 --> 1:24:28.563
She's really smart!
The top of her class!

1:24:28.563 --> 1:24:31.525
People are so jealous.

1:24:33.527 --> 1:24:35.570
Are you a good student?

1:24:35.570 --> 1:24:36.571
Yes.

1:24:41.535 --> 1:24:42.577
Hey!

1:24:44.538 --> 1:24:49.626
You look so funny.
Your face is bigger than me!

1:24:49.626 --> 1:24:52.629
The baby fat will come off.

1:24:53.630 --> 1:24:57.634
Not on your face!
Don't you know?

1:25:50.645 --> 1:25:52.606
POLICE

1:25:54.608 --> 1:25:55.650
Let's go!

1:25:58.653 --> 1:25:59.696
Run!

1:27:09.683 --> 1:27:11.726
Where did the girl go?

1:27:12.727 --> 1:27:14.729
Said to come here.

1:27:16.690 --> 1:27:17.732
Who?

1:27:17.732 --> 1:27:19.693
The girl's uncle.

1:27:21.736 --> 1:27:24.739
Oh no! She can't go!

1:27:24.739 --> 1:27:26.783
Are you family?

1:27:26.783 --> 1:27:28.744
No, I'm not.

1:27:29.703 --> 1:27:30.787
Then, who are you?

1:27:30.787 --> 1:27:32.789
I'm PARK Bok-soon!

1:27:38.712 --> 1:27:40.797
How do I get here?

1:27:40.797 --> 1:27:42.799
You can take the bus.

1:27:43.717 --> 1:27:45.760
Is the subway running now?

1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:49.723
Download an app
of the subway map.

1:27:50.724 --> 1:27:53.727
Do you use iPhone
or Android?

1:28:01.776 --> 1:28:03.820
Here! Stop!

1:28:04.779 --> 1:28:06.740
Stop!

1:28:15.832 --> 1:28:17.793
Welcome.

1:28:24.841 --> 1:28:27.844
Looks fresh from Jeju.

1:28:27.844 --> 1:28:28.845
It's from Chile.

1:28:29.763 --> 1:28:30.847
You said Jeju.

1:28:30.847 --> 1:28:33.850
Once marinated
they're the same.

1:28:33.850 --> 1:28:35.810
They're all from the sea.

1:29:10.845 --> 1:29:11.888
It's pretty good.

1:29:12.806 --> 1:29:14.849
Selling food for 12 years,
it has to be.

1:29:15.809 --> 1:29:16.810
How's business?

1:29:16.810 --> 1:29:17.894
I'm about to go under.

1:29:18.812 --> 1:29:20.855
It's cuz the place sucks.

1:29:20.855 --> 1:29:22.899
I'll fix it up for you
real soon.

1:29:22.899 --> 1:29:23.900
Hey.

1:29:24.901 --> 1:29:27.821
Just pay up what you owe me!

1:29:28.822 --> 1:29:29.864
Right...

1:29:31.866 --> 1:29:32.909
Let's drink.

1:29:33.910 --> 1:29:34.911
Here.

1:29:42.877 --> 1:29:43.920
Tae-su!

1:29:51.845 --> 1:29:52.887
Tae-su!

1:29:53.847 --> 1:29:56.891
When you were left at our door
at age 5...

1:29:57.934 --> 1:30:01.938
Dad said to send you
to an orphanage.

1:30:01.938 --> 1:30:03.940
But I insisted!

1:30:04.858 --> 1:30:06.943
Because you were so cute.

1:30:06.943 --> 1:30:09.863
With your big, sparkling eyes...

1:30:09.863 --> 1:30:12.866
Everyone in town came by
to see you.

1:30:13.909 --> 1:30:15.952
They were all so jealous.

1:30:15.952 --> 1:30:18.872
Said a blessing rolled in!

1:30:20.957 --> 1:30:23.960
I was really good to you.

1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:25.962
But people will curse.

1:30:25.962 --> 1:30:29.883
Saying I brought you up
in a bad environment!

1:30:30.925 --> 1:30:33.970
I shouldn't have taken you in.

1:30:33.970 --> 1:30:35.930
I didn't know!

1:30:36.890 --> 1:30:38.933
A pretty boy like you...

1:30:39.934 --> 1:30:43.938
Your mom must've abandoned you
cuz she knew.

1:30:44.898 --> 1:30:48.943
That bitch!
Leaving a weird kid at my door!

1:30:49.944 --> 1:30:52.906
How did you get like this?

1:30:53.948 --> 1:30:54.991
- Mom.
- Yes?

1:30:55.992 --> 1:30:57.952
Listen.

1:30:58.995 --> 1:31:01.956
Wanna hear something
really weird?

1:31:01.956 --> 1:31:02.999
What?

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:08.963
The men behind me...

1:31:10.006 --> 1:31:12.926
Aren't they too quiet?

1:31:13.968 --> 1:31:16.971
You fools set me up?

1:31:51.005 --> 1:31:52.966
Now.

1:31:53.967 --> 1:31:58.012
Let's get our ties
straightened out.

1:31:59.013 --> 1:32:01.015
What'll it be?

1:32:02.016 --> 1:32:04.978
What do you want me to do?

1:32:08.982 --> 1:32:10.025
Tae-su...

1:32:11.025 --> 1:32:13.027
Why'd you do it fool!

1:32:13.027 --> 1:32:15.029
He's your brother!

1:32:15.029 --> 1:32:19.075
Despite everything,
Tae-su's always been good to us!

1:32:19.075 --> 1:32:21.035
- Mom!
- Don't call me mom!

1:32:21.035 --> 1:32:23.079
I don't look like your mom!

1:32:23.079 --> 1:32:25.039
You look damn old!

1:32:25.039 --> 1:32:27.083
Look in the mirror fool!

1:32:28.001 --> 1:32:30.086
Call that a son's face?
It's like a husband's!

1:32:31.004 --> 1:32:34.048
So embarrassing!
You're not my son anymore!

1:32:34.048 --> 1:32:36.092
You're out of my life!

1:32:39.012 --> 1:32:42.098
Tae-su! It's so good
to see you smile.

1:32:42.098 --> 1:32:46.102
Right! Since Tae-su was young...

1:32:46.102 --> 1:32:51.065
- He was so thoughtful...
- Right!

1:32:52.066 --> 1:32:55.028
- You scared me.
- You fool!

1:32:55.028 --> 1:32:57.030
You had me there.

1:32:59.115 --> 1:33:01.117
Damn son of a bitch!

1:33:01.117 --> 1:33:03.119
Die! Die!

1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:07.081
Why am I doing
the government's job!

1:33:07.081 --> 1:33:08.124
I'm no cop!

1:33:08.124 --> 1:33:09.083
Shit!

1:33:09.083 --> 1:33:10.084
Bastard!

1:33:10.084 --> 1:33:12.086
They should kill him!

1:33:12.086 --> 1:33:16.090
After all the damn taxes!

1:33:31.147 --> 1:33:34.067
Shit! Who's this?

1:33:37.070 --> 1:33:39.072
The boys all fit?

1:33:39.072 --> 1:33:41.074
Yes. It's a big car.

1:33:43.159 --> 1:33:45.161
Eat it. It's okay.

1:33:46.204 --> 1:33:49.123
Pig trotters are yummy.

1:33:50.083 --> 1:33:52.168
It's loaded with collagen.

1:34:05.139 --> 1:34:07.141
Got the cab fare?

1:34:11.145 --> 1:34:13.189
I did before.

1:34:16.109 --> 1:34:17.151
I'm sorry.

1:34:17.151 --> 1:34:19.070
Shit!

1:34:22.115 --> 1:34:24.158
- Get off!
- Please!

1:34:24.158 --> 1:34:25.201
- Get off!
- Mister!

1:34:25.201 --> 1:34:26.202
Scram!

1:34:36.212 --> 1:34:38.214
- Ik-sang!
- You done? Let's go.

1:34:38.214 --> 1:34:40.216
Do you have to?

1:34:41.175 --> 1:34:43.219
What's with you?
Let's go home.

1:34:43.219 --> 1:34:45.179
- No!
- Please?

1:34:46.139 --> 1:34:48.224
Back off! Let's go home.

1:34:51.185 --> 1:34:52.186
Get off!

1:34:52.186 --> 1:34:54.230
- No! Help me!
- Move!

1:34:55.148 --> 1:34:56.190
I'll raise her.

1:34:56.190 --> 1:34:58.151
Not again! Move!

1:34:58.151 --> 1:35:00.153
- She's cute.
- You nuts? Come here!

1:35:00.153 --> 1:35:03.156
- No! I don't want to!
- Move!

1:35:20.256 --> 1:35:23.217
You're asking for it!

1:35:23.217 --> 1:35:25.261
I have to protect Nari!

1:35:25.261 --> 1:35:27.263
Please? Help me just once?

1:35:27.263 --> 1:35:29.265
Shit! This is nuts!

1:35:30.266 --> 1:35:34.187
I have to protect Nari!
Please!

1:35:35.229 --> 1:35:39.192
- She's an orphan.
- Come here!

1:35:42.195 --> 1:35:43.196
Let's go.

1:35:43.196 --> 1:35:44.238
Move Mom!

1:35:45.239 --> 1:35:47.283
Come here!

1:35:47.283 --> 1:35:49.285
Let's do some good!

1:35:50.244 --> 1:35:52.288
- Let go!
- I don't wanna die!

1:35:52.288 --> 1:35:54.248
Let go!

1:35:56.209 --> 1:35:57.251
Gwang-su!

1:35:57.251 --> 1:35:59.295
What's wrong? Gwang-su!

1:35:59.295 --> 1:36:01.297
Wake up!

1:36:01.297 --> 1:36:04.300
Get up! Gwang-su!

1:36:04.300 --> 1:36:06.260
Breathe!

1:36:06.260 --> 1:36:10.306
- Call 911!
- You crazy!

1:36:37.291 --> 1:36:39.335
Tae-su...

1:36:39.335 --> 1:36:41.295
What's this?

1:36:41.295 --> 1:36:42.338
Snap to it!

1:36:45.341 --> 1:36:47.343
Why turn off the lights?

1:36:52.306 --> 1:36:53.349
Tae-su?

1:36:55.351 --> 1:36:58.271
Where's that smile?

1:37:06.237 --> 1:37:08.322
You have a beautiful smile!

1:37:12.326 --> 1:37:14.328
Good. Let's smile.

1:37:15.371 --> 1:37:18.374
People fight sometimes.

1:37:18.374 --> 1:37:20.376
- Right Mom?
- Of course!

1:39:21.497 --> 1:39:24.458
Take that! Bastard!

1:40:13.466 --> 1:40:15.509
I'm sorry I'm late.

1:40:26.479 --> 1:40:28.481
I'll kill him.

1:44:36.770 --> 1:44:38.772
Nari!

1:44:38.772 --> 1:44:40.733
Nari!

1:44:41.734 --> 1:44:43.736
Nari!

1:44:55.748 --> 1:44:57.791
What happened to your face?

1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:08.844
You're not dead?

1:45:09.762 --> 1:45:10.846
I'm not dead.

1:45:12.806 --> 1:45:15.809
I thought you were dead!

1:45:16.769 --> 1:45:18.771
I'm not!

1:45:36.789 --> 1:45:38.874
Are you really alive?

1:45:39.833 --> 1:45:40.834
Yes.

1:45:40.834 --> 1:45:42.836
Why'd you pretend you died!

1:45:42.836 --> 1:45:44.838
I didn't pretend!

1:45:44.838 --> 1:45:45.881
Stop talking back!

1:45:46.799 --> 1:45:47.883
I'm not!

1:45:55.849 --> 1:45:57.893
I love you, Nari!

1:45:57.893 --> 1:45:59.895
I love you, too!

1:46:02.898 --> 1:46:05.859
Don't die, Nari!

1:46:05.859 --> 1:46:06.902
You too, sis!

1:46:07.820 --> 1:46:09.822
Let's live together!

1:46:36.849 --> 1:46:37.933
Who's that?

1:46:39.852 --> 1:46:40.894
I don't know.

1:46:41.937 --> 1:46:43.856
There.

1:46:44.898 --> 1:46:47.943
Could you get me the phone?

1:47:30.986 --> 1:47:32.946
Mister!

1:47:34.948 --> 1:47:37.951
How can I go to the country?

1:47:39.995 --> 1:47:41.997
Go by car!

1:48:10.984 --> 1:48:12.945
Newsflash.

1:48:12.945 --> 1:48:17.032
A family has been found dead
at a restaurant.

1:48:17.032 --> 1:48:20.994
There are several more corpses
to add to the mystery.

1:48:21.954 --> 1:48:23.997
HWANG reporting.

1:49:08.041 --> 1:49:09.084
Nari!

1:49:10.085 --> 1:49:12.045
Nari!

1:49:14.047 --> 1:49:15.090
I got money!

1:49:16.091 --> 1:49:17.092
Yup! See?

1:49:19.011 --> 1:49:20.095
Some man just gave it to me.

1:49:21.054 --> 1:49:22.055
Why?

1:49:23.015 --> 1:49:24.099
Maybe he likes me.

1:49:25.017 --> 1:49:28.061
How many black bean noodles
can I eat with this?

1:49:29.021 --> 1:49:30.105
750 bowls?

1:49:30.105 --> 1:49:32.065
750?

1:49:34.026 --> 1:49:35.110
Then, let's go eat it.

1:49:35.110 --> 1:49:40.073
Worm's ribs and virgin balls?
That's crazy bitch

1:49:41.074 --> 1:49:45.120
Married daughter becoming a tramp?
That's crazy bitch

1:49:46.079 --> 1:49:51.084
Always troubled and worried?
That's crazy bitch

1:49:51.084 --> 1:49:56.089
Angry fools and lazy bums?
That's crazy bitch

1:49:56.089 --> 1:50:00.135
Throwing poop on a happy face?
That's crazy bitch

1:50:03.055 --> 1:50:08.060
VICTIMS' REMAINS
MADE INTO POTTERY

1:50:11.063 --> 1:50:14.107
STEPSON KILLS HIS FAMILY

1:50:16.068 --> 1:50:17.152
Ms. PARK Bok-soon?

1:50:19.071 --> 1:50:20.113
Black bean noodles?

1:50:20.113 --> 1:50:22.115
You must like noodles.

1:50:23.116 --> 1:50:24.159
Hello, Ms. PARK Bok-soon.

1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:29.122
I apologize for what happened
when we asked you to leave.

1:50:30.082 --> 1:50:33.168
I take full responsibility
and offer my condolences.

1:50:35.170 --> 1:50:37.130
Thank you.

1:50:38.090 --> 1:50:39.132
Here.

1:50:41.093 --> 1:50:43.095
It’s $3,000.

1:50:47.182 --> 1:50:52.104
I heard about you two
and prepared this for you.

1:50:52.104 --> 1:50:55.148
I hope it will help
in starting over together.

1:50:59.152 --> 1:51:01.113
Thank you for $3,000.

1:51:01.113 --> 1:51:03.156
Thank you for accepting it.

1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:07.202
Hold this, please.

1:51:07.202 --> 1:51:10.163
Thank you for trusting me
with this.

1:51:10.163 --> 1:51:12.165
Here you go.

1:51:13.166 --> 1:51:17.129
From now on,
you can't sell stuff here.

1:51:18.130 --> 1:51:21.174
Those men will stop you
from working here.

1:51:24.177 --> 1:51:25.220
But this is my spot.

1:51:26.138 --> 1:51:28.140
This is my land.

1:51:31.143 --> 1:51:32.227
Back off Mister!

1:51:32.227 --> 1:51:34.187
Back off Bok-soon!

1:51:34.187 --> 1:51:36.189
Don't make me mad!

1:51:36.189 --> 1:51:38.150
I'll say it again!

1:51:38.150 --> 1:51:41.153
This is PARK Bok-soon's spot!

1:51:41.153 --> 1:51:43.196
I worked here since I was 10!

1:51:43.196 --> 1:51:47.200
Granny definitely said
I could work here!

1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:50.245
- By law, it's my...
- This is my spot!

1:51:50.245 --> 1:51:53.248
- Cutting me off...
- I'm staying put!

1:51:54.207 --> 1:51:56.251
I do whatever I set my mind to!

1:51:56.251 --> 1:51:59.254
The hell?
You two-faced jerk!

1:52:00.172 --> 1:52:02.257
Let sleeping hogs lie!

1:52:02.257 --> 1:52:05.218
Fine! Give my money back!

1:52:06.219 --> 1:52:09.181
Give back my $3,000!

1:52:11.183 --> 1:52:12.267
Hand it over now!

1:52:13.185 --> 1:52:15.270
Can't you hear me?

1:52:15.270 --> 1:52:17.189
You hear me!

1:52:17.189 --> 1:52:19.232
Give me my money!

1:52:19.232 --> 1:52:20.233
Hey!

1:52:20.233 --> 1:52:23.236
Give me back my money!

1:52:23.236 --> 1:52:24.237
Give it back!

1:52:24.237 --> 1:52:26.239
Or I'll destroy this place!

1:52:30.285 --> 1:52:31.286
There!

1:52:32.204 --> 1:52:33.246
You bastard!

1:52:34.247 --> 1:52:37.292
Know who I am?
I'm PARK Bok-soon!

1:52:38.251 --> 1:52:40.253
- Get my $3,000!
- Son of a bitch!

1:52:40.253 --> 1:52:44.257
- I'll get you!
- We have laws in this country!

1:52:44.257 --> 1:52:47.302
Let go! You bastards!

1:52:48.220 --> 1:52:50.222
Sir! Watch out!
