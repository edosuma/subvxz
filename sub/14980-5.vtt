12:24.161 --> 12:26.527
Maybe the group
is forcing him to lie.

Keep him with

Use the chief.

12:32.961 --> 12:36.499
The more guilty he feels,
the more likely he is
to tell you what he knows.

All right, probies.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.644

in front of you.
Hold your line,

12:59.738 --> 13:01.854

with the wall.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.274

Chief Morrow?

13:28.684 --> 13:31.266
What the—

13:31.353 --> 13:33.639
It didn’t work out like this
for Mitchell, did it?

13:33.730 --> 13:36.563
You saved the chief.
Why didn’t you save him?

13:38.610 --> 13:41.101
You’re not the type of guy
to leave a man behind.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.901
Hey, we know
how guilty you feel.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.735
There must be a good reason
you’ve lied.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.618
Come on.
Why won’t you tell us
what happened?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.586
I left him.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.923
I found him in the fire.
I’m supposed to pull him out.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.378
The flames had already
got to him.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.929
But I’m supposed
to pull him out.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.093
I’mjust as guilty
as those other guys.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.721
What other guys?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.814
The ones who were
hazing him.

14:27.659 --> 14:33.120
According to Mr. Donovan,
your men have been Involved
In some pretty extensive hazmg.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.117
He wouldn’t say
who was involved,

14:35.208 --> 14:38.200
but it went beyond
the silent treatment.

14:38.295 --> 14:42.254
Baking soda showers,
bottle rockets in
the bathroom stalls.

14:42.340 --> 14:47.209
- Did you know Eric Mitchell
had a severe peanut allergy?
- No, I didn’t.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.886
Donovan heard that slipping
Mitchell a little PB&J
was the next big gag.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.055
Well, he’sjunior.
He wasn’t one
ofthe hazers.

14:52.142 --> 14:55.054
But that’s why he didn’t
pull Eric’s body out.
He was protecting the men.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.056
He thought that
they had killed Eric.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.683
Were you aware of
what was going on?

14:58.774 --> 15:02.562
Hazing is as much a part
ofthis life as alarm bells.

15:02.652 --> 15:06.110

anaphylactic shock and dies,
c’est la vie?

But when you ’re trapped
Inside a burn/ng bu/ld/ng,

you gotta know that

put code before cowardice,

walk through a wall of fire and come get you.
[Morrow] He’s r/ght

15:16.708 --> 15:20.576
I need men who are willing
to risk their lives on a daily basis.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.581
And Mitchelljust didn’t have it in him.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.708
So you looked the other way?

15:24.800 --> 15:26.381
He needed to learn.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.302
But make no mistake about it.

15:30.388 --> 15:33.175
I demand a certain level of respect
out of my men.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.758
There’s a line,
and they wouldn’t have crossed it.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.515
Then you won’t mind if we talk
to the other men in the company?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.312
No.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.771
Kerry, the chief’s niece,
she’ll help you out.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.853
I got real work to do.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.565
It’s like they never
left the frat house.

No, it’s notjust

Initiation rites
can be found
in all major cultures.

15:56.373 --> 16:00.616
You’re defending these guys?
Hazing can serve an important
psychological function.

16:00.710 --> 16:04.669
That’s funny. I don’t remember
reading any articles in
the A.P.A.journal on swirlies.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.793
Initiation for you

pretty hard core, huh?

16:07.884 --> 16:10.717
You know, you make fun.
But you try waking up
in a shower stall...

and a quart of macaroni salad

Yeah, she does.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.430

because part of her
wants to tell

- You making any headway
with the old Trillo video?
- Not really.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.172
No evidence of
emotional change at all?

16:53.263 --> 16:55.549
Trillo doesn’t seem
all that different to me.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.596
Let’s run the tape.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.269
I’ve been watching
video surveillance
from before Trillo’s arrest.

17:03.356 --> 17:07.520
That’s good. Natural habitat.
It’s the best baseline.
All right.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.818
Let’s drop the sound
and run it side by side...

17:09.905 --> 17:13.272
with the video we
shot at the penitentiary.

17:13.366 --> 17:17.200
Anger. Contempt. Contempt.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.653
Trillo’s emotional palette
was substantially
different back then.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.911
I’m surprised you missed it.
Shocking.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.373
Anger. Disgust.

17:27.464 --> 17:30.126
Oh, and that expression
was practically
default back then.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.798
The brow lowered
upper e yelid raised

17:31.885 --> 17:34.467
Now, that glare is the mark
ofa hostile personality.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.388
Howman y of these
did Trillo flash
in the old video?

17:38.475 --> 17:40.966
I don’t know.
Three or four a minute?

17:41.061 --> 17:44.474
Well, he didn’t show any
in our interview,
not until the burger incident.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.271
Seems like a pretty
big change to me.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.939
- Whatever.
- Oh.

17:52.030 --> 17:55.522
Now, that is the kind of
emotionally detached scientific
analysis we value around here.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.608
I’ll be sure to pass that on
to the governor.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.364
Do you have any idea
how much worse the
Puno-Salva war will be...

18:00.455 --> 18:02.286
ifTrillo gets out
and takes over?

18:02.374 --> 18:05.241
Much, much worse.
And I’m sure there’d be a boom
in the crack trade too.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.246
What ifTrillo’s
just conning us?

18:07.337 --> 18:11.000
Well, emotional evidence
would suggest
he’s not the same man.

18:11.091 --> 18:15.585
Do you know how many kids in
the barrio want the kind of power
Trillo had before he went away?

18:15.679 --> 18:17.670

at working the system.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.177
Sure he is.

And he’s changed mine.

22:00.904 --> 22:04.488

That’s quite a statement.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.735

Of course,

[Cal] There it is.

22:28.264 --> 22:31.722

22:31.809 --> 22:34.767
Now, we do this by accident
when we don’t mean
what we say.

22:34.854 --> 22:40.144
Holly Sando did it every time
she said she thought
Trillo had changed

22:40.235 --> 22:45.150
- And then there’s this.
- You can’t let him die in this prison.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.653
There.

22:49.744 --> 22:53.987
Classic glare, which is a bit surprising
from a true believer in Mr. Trillo.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.368
Why then lobby for
the release ofa man
who killed your husband...

22:56.459 --> 22:58.370
ifyou don’t believe
he’s changed?

22:58.461 --> 23:01.624
Perhaps she ’s trying
to con vmce herself
Maybe she believes...

23:01.714 --> 23:05.798
he’s changed intellectually,
but she can’t quite
get there emotionally.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.126
Or maybe Trillo
got one of his old buddies
to threaten her.

23:16.229 --> 23:20.268
People always think
that anger is
the most dangerous emotion.

23:20.358 --> 23:23.020
But disgust is
the language of hatred.

against Eric Mitchell?

make your life hell?

23:44.841 --> 23:49.005

Nine years, and
I never had a problem.

I mean,
the occasional bad joke.

23:51.389 --> 23:55.974
Watermelon in the locker.
But I kept my mouth shut.

23:56.060 --> 23:59.143
We’re not black.
We’re not white.
We’re firemen.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.186
So we get hazed

24:02.984 --> 24:06.943
Mitchell get hazed,
he runs to the Vulcans—
the black firefighter society.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.487
Requested a transfer.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.656
Mitchell
made this racial.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.651
So you had to choose sides.
I tried to protect him.

24:14.746 --> 24:17.988
But he was
young and proud.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.334
He wouldn’t learn.

24:20.418 --> 24:23.330
And the more he’d push,
the worse it got.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.457
So you hopped
on the fire wagon?

24:25.548 --> 24:27.459
You found out he had
a peanut allergy,

24:27.550 --> 24:29.506
and you thought,
“Well, that’ll teach him”?

24:29.594 --> 24:31.630
Yeah.
We did that
months ago.

24:31.721 --> 24:36.932
The kid got hives all over,
and it was funny as hell.
But it didn’t kill him.

24:39.729 --> 24:43.096
No. Things
got much worse.

24:45.193 --> 24:47.605
My guess:
someone screwed
with his equipment.

24:47.695 --> 24:53.190
- Wasn’t you?
- I wouldn’t touch another
firefighter’s equipment.

24:53.326 --> 24:56.910
Now, I may have hated the kid,
but I didn’t want him dead.
Someone did.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.033
Who had the racial problem
with Mitchell?

25:04.879 --> 25:09.714
A lot ofguys.
It could’ve been any one of’em.

25:09.801 --> 25:12.167
I can’t believe Wallace
didn’t come forward earlier.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.877
Yeah, well,
the black firefighter
won’t rat on the racists.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.471
It is a little surprising, isn’t it?
Well, not really.

25:17.558 --> 25:20.846
The firehouse is a more
important association
for Wallace than race.

25:20.937 --> 25:24.020
And in his mind,
race wasn’t an issue
until Mitchell came along.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.639
You’re saying this

[Eli] No, no.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.645
This is the new face
of racism.

25:28.736 --> 25:31.113
Instead of overt prejudice,
you see unconscious
discrimination.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.483

but a lot of people...

25:33.574 --> 25:36.316

over the black guy
with the same résumé.

25:36.411 --> 25:39.198
And when unconscious
racism surfaces,
it can be lethal.

as reasonable hazing
turns deadly.

about the girl—

31:05.823 --> 31:07.734

was anger,

which suggests that
Eric may ha ve crossed
