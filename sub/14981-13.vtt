00:02.850 --> 00:05.251
Victor?

00:05.319 --> 00:07.787
Victor, I need your help
with something.

00:07.855 --> 00:10.390
Honey, I got water boiling.

00:10.458 --> 00:13.159
Dinner can wait.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074

00:24.338 --> 00:26.773
Want to help me out of this?

00:26.841 --> 00:28.975
Whoo.

00:43.891 --> 00:46.726
You get it hard on
an old man, don't you?

00:46.794 --> 00:47.861
I do, don't I?

00:57.104 --> 00:58.705
Ugh.

01:05.312 --> 01:07.814
How did I get so lucky?

01:07.882 --> 01:09.349
You didn't.

01:09.416 --> 01:11.918
I'm using you for sex.

01:11.986 --> 01:13.786
I love you, Clara.

01:13.854 --> 01:15.622
I love you more.

01:17.391 --> 01:19.292
I'll be back in an hour.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.194
Where are you off to?

01:21.262 --> 01:24.631
Strawberries.

01:24.698 --> 01:27.600
Champagne.

01:27.668 --> 01:30.270
Don't you leave this bed.

01:30.337 --> 01:31.838
Uh-uh.

01:50.090 --> 01:53.459
Oh, my God, Leo.

01:55.296 --> 01:56.763
What am I going to do?

02:04.405 --> 02:06.172
Did you kill your husband?!

02:06.240 --> 02:07.740
No, I did not.
I loved my husband.

02:07.808 --> 02:09.741
If you're acquitted,
you'll be a billionaire.

02:09.810 --> 02:10.842
How does that make me feel?

02:10.911 --> 02:12.011
My client has no comment.

02:12.079 --> 02:13.813
What's it like
sleeping alone now?

02:13.881 --> 02:15.381
By the way, how was the sex?

02:15.449 --> 02:17.383
Get her inside.

02:18.953 --> 02:20.553
What station are you from?

02:20.621 --> 02:21.621
Where are your credentials?

02:21.689 --> 02:23.189
This is a public street
in a free country.

02:23.257 --> 02:24.223
I don't need credentials.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.292
You're no journalist.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.628
Someone told you
to ask those questions.

02:28.696 --> 02:30.463
Look. I'm just doing my job.

02:30.531 --> 02:32.799
I think I can guess who for.

02:34.635 --> 02:37.904
So, what are you getting
off Mrs. Musso?

02:37.972 --> 02:40.073
Well, it's more sadness
than guilt really.

02:40.140 --> 02:42.709
Well, the evidence
is rock solid.

02:42.776 --> 02:45.378
There's a partial print on a
syringe containing cyanide.

02:45.446 --> 02:47.113
There's no sign of forced
entry in her apartment.

02:47.181 --> 02:49.215
And she is the primary
beneficiary of the will.

02:49.283 --> 02:50.750
Well, you got all that
going for you, Crosby.

02:50.818 --> 02:52.051
I mean, what do you
need me for?

02:52.119 --> 02:54.354
Never underestimate the
value of an expert witness.

02:54.421 --> 02:56.856
Doc, you wanna do this?

02:59.627 --> 03:01.694
Hello.

03:01.762 --> 03:03.262
How was the sex?

03:03.330 --> 03:05.531
Oh, hello, Zoe.
Well it's been a long time.

03:05.599 --> 03:07.800
What do you need?
You need a reference?

03:07.868 --> 03:10.903
I haven't had any trouble
getting offers so far.

03:10.971 --> 03:14.674
You sent one of your minions to ask vicious
and personal questions to my client

03:14.742 --> 03:16.609
Just so you could read
her reactions on tv.

03:16.677 --> 03:18.611
I can't hear you.
No, can you say that again.

03:18.679 --> 03:20.647
Hear me now?

03:20.714 --> 03:21.748
Oh.

03:21.815 --> 03:23.249
Clear as a bell.

03:23.317 --> 03:25.785
Counselor.
Counselor.

03:25.853 --> 03:28.187
I'd like to speak with
my ex-husband in private,

03:28.255 --> 03:29.355
If that's all right.

03:33.394 --> 03:35.228
Absolutely.

03:35.295 --> 03:37.597
I'd like an answer by the end of the
business day, if you don't mind.

03:37.665 --> 03:40.633
Otherwise, I gotta go to Rayder firm,
and I don't really want to do that.

03:40.701 --> 03:42.301
So, end of the day?

03:42.369 --> 03:43.736
Fair enough.

03:49.643 --> 03:51.044
Let me guess.

03:51.111 --> 03:53.312
He wants you to be
his expert witness?

03:53.380 --> 03:56.749
Yep. Your client is hiding
something, Zoe.

03:56.817 --> 03:58.284
Probably of a sexual nature,

03:58.352 --> 04:00.553
Granted that is wishful
thinking on my part.

04:00.621 --> 04:02.989
You see how she's bringing
that hand up to her face?

04:03.057 --> 04:04.390
She's got a secret.

04:04.458 --> 04:07.627
I will tear you apart on the stand, Cal.
And you know it.

04:07.695 --> 04:09.295
Nice charm, that is.

04:09.363 --> 04:11.230
So, you really think
she didn't kill her husband?

04:11.298 --> 04:12.598
Yes, I do.

04:12.666 --> 04:13.700
What makes you so sure?

04:13.767 --> 04:15.068
All the evidence is
circumstantial.

04:15.135 --> 04:16.536
And as for motive,
there is none.

04:16.603 --> 04:18.805
My client didn't want
for anything.

04:18.872 --> 04:22.041
It was a loving
and faithful marriage.

04:22.108 --> 04:23.643
She got an alibi?

04:25.045 --> 04:26.312
Uh-oh.

04:26.380 --> 04:27.447
How much is she paying you?

04:27.514 --> 04:28.881
Exactly what I'm worth.

04:28.949 --> 04:30.450
Well, drinks are on you then.

04:30.517 --> 04:33.953
Still...No alibi.

04:34.021 --> 04:36.589
Well, the trauma of finding
her husband dead

04:36.657 --> 04:39.625
Caused Clara to lose her memory
for the 40 minutes

04:39.693 --> 04:42.762
Between the last time she saw him alive
and when she discovered his body.

04:47.568 --> 04:50.103
Look at it. I mean, really.

04:50.170 --> 04:53.172
She is pushing
those tears out, she is.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.741
I mean, she's faking it.

04:59.713 --> 05:02.482
We both know
that this "science" of yours

05:02.549 --> 05:04.417
Has a serious margin for error.

05:04.485 --> 05:05.818
And it just won't cut it
in a court of law.

05:05.886 --> 05:07.053
And what will?

05:07.121 --> 05:11.090
Tears for a dead husband
that left her $1.2 billion?

05:11.158 --> 05:12.191
I know why you're doing this.

05:12.259 --> 05:13.659
And you're not going
to get under my skin.

05:13.727 --> 05:14.727
Or my skirt.

05:14.795 --> 05:16.262
You know that's a lie, that is.

05:16.330 --> 05:18.231
I mean the skin part.

05:18.298 --> 05:20.967
Is this funny to you?
The most important case of my career?

05:21.034 --> 05:23.603
I haven't even taken
the bloody job yet, Zoe.

05:23.670 --> 05:25.905
You know, unlike you, I don't need
to have studied amazonian pigmies

05:25.973 --> 05:27.340
For 6 years to know
that that's a lie.

05:27.407 --> 05:29.375
You want me
to do this. You do.

05:29.443 --> 05:31.077
You don't know why you do.
But you do.

05:31.145 --> 05:33.412
Did I say
"serious margin for error"?

05:33.480 --> 05:36.082
I was being generous.

05:36.150 --> 05:37.650
Or couldn't you tell.

05:37.718 --> 05:40.353
You know, it's going
to be a shame

05:40.420 --> 05:42.355
To disappoint you
in the courtroom.

How can anyone think Clara
killed her husband?

06:16.523 --> 06:18.057
I've been friends with her
for almost 10 years.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.459
There's no way she
could have done this.

06:20.527 --> 06:23.596
Gotta love how everyone comes out
of the woodwork on cases like this.

06:23.664 --> 06:25.631
Well, they've gotta get
their 15 minutes somehow.

06:25.699 --> 06:27.767
By turning this woman's
life into a circus.

06:27.835 --> 06:29.802
Yeah. Well, we're all part
of that circus now.

06:29.870 --> 06:32.872
Prosecution. Foster,
you're prepping witnesses.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.140
You two, you get jury watch.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.108
You want us to read the
jurors for the whole trial?

06:36.176 --> 06:38.010
Track 'em individually,
see what makes them tick.

06:38.078 --> 06:39.111
But then look at them
as a group.

06:39.179 --> 06:40.646
I want to know which way
they're leaning.

06:40.714 --> 06:42.114
You know, the leaders,
the followers.

06:42.182 --> 06:43.749
Well go on.

06:48.222 --> 06:51.190
You're not just doing this
to push Zoe's buttons.

06:51.258 --> 06:53.159
There's something else
going on here.

06:53.227 --> 06:55.094
This is about justice, Foster.

06:55.162 --> 06:57.196
There's something else.
Zoe-related.

06:58.565 --> 07:00.266
Justice for a murder victim.

07:00.334 --> 07:02.668
By avoiding my question,
you just answered it.

07:02.736 --> 07:05.805
I just hope for all our sakes,
you know what you're doing.

07:05.873 --> 07:07.640
Join the club.

07:09.343 --> 07:11.410
6 of the jurors look
convinced Clara is guilty

07:11.478 --> 07:12.678
Just from
the opening arguments.

07:12.746 --> 07:14.480
You could see approval
on their faces

07:14.548 --> 07:16.215
Every time
the prosecutor talked.

07:16.283 --> 07:19.151
Maybe. But these 2 are
for the defense.

07:19.219 --> 07:20.953
And they've already
emerged as leaders.

07:21.021 --> 07:23.456
Jurors 6, 7, and 11 were looking
at them the whole time,

07:23.523 --> 07:24.724
Gauging their reaction.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.626
Which way you two leaning?

07:26.693 --> 07:28.761
Maybe he wasn't dying
fast enough for her.

07:28.829 --> 07:31.197
I mean, the guy was 30
years older than she is.

07:31.265 --> 07:33.165
So?
So...

07:33.233 --> 07:35.134
It can affect
the power dynamic.

07:35.202 --> 07:38.471
Imbalance of power in a relationship
can lead to victimization.

07:38.538 --> 07:40.806
Oh, that struck a nerve.

07:40.874 --> 07:42.375
That's interesting.

07:42.442 --> 07:45.011
Studies show that the most
successful marriages are the ones

07:45.078 --> 07:47.713
Where husbands are at least 5
years older than their wives.

07:47.781 --> 07:52.585
So, being with an older man
broadens your horizons, does it?

07:52.653 --> 07:56.055
I'm sure Clara learned
a lot from Victor.

07:56.123 --> 07:57.890
Yeah. I'm sure she did--
about denture cream.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.593
You see,
you're not listening, again.

08:00.661 --> 08:05.097
Loker, what Torres is saying is that she
needs to be stimulated and challenged.

08:05.165 --> 08:06.332
By experience.

08:07.935 --> 08:10.069
So, who was
this old fart then, eh?

08:11.438 --> 08:12.705
I was talking about Clara.

08:12.773 --> 08:14.206
Nah. You weren't.

08:14.274 --> 08:16.275
You connected with a memory,

08:16.343 --> 08:19.145
Which I proceeded to belittle.

08:20.614 --> 08:22.114
Sorry about that.

08:26.453 --> 08:28.955
Oh, you cannot sing
the praises of older men

08:29.022 --> 08:31.023
And then not give up details.

08:31.091 --> 08:32.924
Watch me.

08:40.433 --> 08:41.500
All right.

08:41.568 --> 08:42.835
What? You couldn't take me
one-on-one?

08:42.903 --> 08:44.035
Nah. Been there, done that.

08:44.104 --> 08:45.404
Ow, Loker, let go!

08:45.472 --> 08:47.273
I promise to play nice today.

08:47.341 --> 08:49.275
Last time you said that
you left claw marks.

08:51.411 --> 08:53.279
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

08:53.347 --> 08:55.247
And nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

08:55.315 --> 08:56.349
That's not possible.

08:56.416 --> 08:57.583
Excuse me.

08:57.651 --> 09:00.519
Well, no one can tell the
whole truth, your honor.

09:00.587 --> 09:03.956
I mean, it's subjective.
It's filtered through our own experiences.

09:04.024 --> 09:05.191
And that's the real truth.

09:05.258 --> 09:07.126
Well, how about promising
to be honest

09:07.194 --> 09:09.395
To the best of your ability?

09:09.463 --> 09:11.197
Now, you're talking.

09:11.264 --> 09:12.965
Please, be seated.
Thank you, your honor.

09:13.033 --> 09:14.967
Dr. Lightman,
your resume speaks for itself.

09:15.035 --> 09:17.603
You're Oxford educated.
You're a doctorate in psychology.

09:17.671 --> 09:19.538
And you're a consultant
for the FBI.

09:19.606 --> 09:22.675
As you well know, the key
question in this trial is

09:22.743 --> 09:25.277
Where was Clara Musso the night
her husband was murdered?

09:25.345 --> 09:28.247
The defense wants us to believe

09:28.315 --> 09:31.484
That the trauma of finding
her husband dead

09:31.551 --> 09:35.087
Has left Mrs. Musso unable
to recall the 40 minutes

09:35.155 --> 09:39.258
Between leaving him
and discovering his corpse.

09:39.326 --> 09:41.293
Dr. Lightman,
in your expert opinion,

09:41.361 --> 09:44.230
Does this claim of memory loss
pass the sniff test?

09:45.365 --> 09:46.499
No.

09:46.566 --> 09:48.701
Could you elaborate?

09:48.769 --> 09:49.935
Yeah.

09:50.003 --> 09:52.104
It's been proven
that some trauma--

09:52.172 --> 09:55.207
Warfare, child abuse--

09:55.275 --> 09:56.809
Can cause memory loss.

09:56.877 --> 09:58.511
Do you have experience
with such cases?

09:58.578 --> 09:59.645
Yeah. Plenty.

09:59.713 --> 10:02.982
I've worked with soldiers,
rape victims.

10:03.050 --> 10:07.653
Memory loss is caused
by degradation or abuse.

10:07.721 --> 10:10.456
Shock of a dead spouse,
I mean, that'd be a first.

10:11.758 --> 10:13.159
How about a shock
of committing murder?

10:13.226 --> 10:16.829
Killers have been known
to experience amnesia.

10:16.897 --> 10:20.833
Forensic psychologists
Call it red out.

10:20.901 --> 10:23.269
How common is it to lie,
claiming memory loss?

10:23.336 --> 10:25.671
Well, 9 out of 10 people
claiming memory loss are lying.

10:25.739 --> 10:27.139
Why would they do that?

10:27.207 --> 10:30.443
Well, it's easier to say,
"I can't remember."

10:30.510 --> 10:33.646
Than tell the truth.

10:33.713 --> 10:36.382
I have nothing further.

10:36.450 --> 10:37.950
Your witness, counselor.

10:38.018 --> 10:39.618
Ahem.

10:39.686 --> 10:42.888
Permission to treat Dr. Lightman
as a hostile witness?

10:42.956 --> 10:44.623
Granted.
Dr. Lightman!

10:44.691 --> 10:46.725
I'm sorry. Won't happen
again, your honor.

10:46.793 --> 10:47.726
Thank you.

10:47.794 --> 10:50.529
Dr. Lightman was born hostile.

10:50.597 --> 10:52.198
He also happens
to be my ex-husband.

10:52.265 --> 10:54.934
Guilty as charged.

10:55.001 --> 10:56.769
But, you know, it was my loss.

10:56.837 --> 10:59.772
'cause truly she is an angel.

11:01.341 --> 11:03.909
The prosecution has touted
your credentials, Dr. Lightman.

11:03.977 --> 11:06.645
Are we to understand
that you possess the gift

11:06.713 --> 11:09.615
Of being able to distinguish
between truth and lies?

11:09.683 --> 11:12.151
No. No. 20 years of research
is not a gift, is it?

11:12.219 --> 11:15.187
You and I know, it's a
bit of a curse, really.

11:15.255 --> 11:16.989
Indeed it was.

11:17.057 --> 11:20.593
In fact, do you recall
being jeered off the stage

11:20.660 --> 11:24.230
While keynoting the Harvard global
psychology conference in 2005?

11:24.297 --> 11:25.764
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I do. Yeah!

11:25.832 --> 11:27.433
Yeah, and it's bonkers.

11:27.501 --> 11:31.437
Right? Because I could have
sworn that they were cheering.

11:31.505 --> 11:33.739
They called it pop psychology.

11:33.807 --> 11:34.974
Voodoo science.

11:35.041 --> 11:37.209
I think it's because
they're scared of me.

11:38.612 --> 11:40.279
4 years ago when
we were still married,

11:40.347 --> 11:42.581
You accused my boss
of sleeping with me.

11:42.649 --> 11:43.883
The gloves are coming
off now, eh?

11:43.950 --> 11:45.784
Objection! Your honor,
that's immaterial.

11:45.852 --> 11:47.553
Dr. Lightman,
last warning.

11:47.621 --> 11:48.721
Overruled.

11:48.788 --> 11:51.390
Didn't it come out eventually
that my boss--

11:51.458 --> 11:54.260
A man--was in fact gay?

11:54.327 --> 11:56.662
Yeah. Yeah, it did.

11:56.730 --> 11:59.532
Yeah. I was way
off the mark on that one.

11:59.599 --> 12:03.202
But I mean,
I was jealous. I was young.

12:03.270 --> 12:05.371
I was head over heels
in love. You know.

12:05.438 --> 12:09.875
By day I'm a scientist.
But by night, I'm fallible.

12:09.943 --> 12:11.577
I'm only human.

12:11.645 --> 12:13.145
Well, I'm not questioning
your humanity.

12:13.213 --> 12:14.613
And certainly not
your fallibility.

12:14.681 --> 12:15.614
Oh, that's a relief.

12:15.682 --> 12:17.449
You are here because
of your expertise

12:17.517 --> 12:19.018
In psychology and lying.

12:19.085 --> 12:20.386
I'm challenging that.

12:20.453 --> 12:22.955
Your flagrant manipulation
of the jury notwithstanding.

12:23.023 --> 12:26.025
Ok. But when you say that
your client is innocent,

12:26.092 --> 12:27.159
You don't fully believe that.

12:27.227 --> 12:28.561
Again, you misjudge my thoughts

12:28.628 --> 12:30.563
Because I know
my client is innocent.

12:30.630 --> 12:32.798
Why don't you want to hear
the science then?

12:32.866 --> 12:36.335
Your testimony is limited
to scientific context

12:36.403 --> 12:38.871
Not specific opinions
on who's lying.

12:38.939 --> 12:40.172
All right, well you want
to hear the whole truth?

12:40.240 --> 12:41.907
That woman over there--
your client--

12:41.975 --> 12:43.242
The black widow over there--

12:43.310 --> 12:44.243
Control yourself!

12:44.311 --> 12:45.244
When she says
she doesn't know--

12:45.312 --> 12:46.278
Dr. Lightman.

12:46.346 --> 12:47.446
Control yourself.

12:47.514 --> 12:48.681
Well, she's lying.
And that's a fact.

12:48.748 --> 12:51.350
Control yourself or I will have
the judge control you!

12:51.418 --> 12:53.185
Her? Do me a favor,
look at her.

12:53.253 --> 12:55.020
She's having a tough enough
time controlling herself.

12:55.088 --> 12:57.523
Marshall, please remove
this witness

12:57.591 --> 12:59.692
Before I hold him in contempt.

12:59.759 --> 13:01.193
I mean, look at her.
Bulging eyes,

13:01.261 --> 13:02.328
The guilt all over her face.

13:02.395 --> 13:03.362
I think it's the booze.

13:03.430 --> 13:04.630
Get him out of here!

13:17.524 --> 13:19.492
Oh. Hello, darling.

13:24.698 --> 13:25.965
What?

13:26.033 --> 13:28.368
I hope that was part of
a careful plan in there.

13:28.435 --> 13:29.702
Careful's for lawyers
and accountants, right?

13:29.770 --> 13:31.637
I think it's very
interesting of her

13:31.705 --> 13:33.840
When I called her
a black widow,

13:33.907 --> 13:35.475
She got a little pout.

13:35.542 --> 13:36.709
Her feelings were hurt.

13:36.777 --> 13:37.744
Really?
Surprising.

13:37.811 --> 13:39.479
Shocking, huh?

13:39.546 --> 13:41.147
I'm heading back to the office
to prep more witnesses.

13:41.215 --> 13:42.215
You coming?

13:42.282 --> 13:43.349
No, I gotta see a man
about a dog.

13:43.417 --> 13:44.417
I'll catch up with you.

13:44.485 --> 13:46.085
Ok. Behave.

13:56.263 --> 13:59.065
You're right.

13:59.133 --> 14:03.069
Hey, you need a lawyer?
No, I'm only joking.

14:03.137 --> 14:04.070
What judge you got?

14:04.138 --> 14:05.471
Denton. Why?

14:05.539 --> 14:06.572
Oh, denton.
He's a complete softy.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.740
He's a pushover.

14:07.808 --> 14:10.143
He's a bleeding heart
liberal, vegetarian.

14:10.210 --> 14:12.311
I mean, the most you're looking at there
is a slap on the wrist. Well done.

14:12.379 --> 14:16.015
No. No. I didn't do anything.
It was that guy.

14:16.083 --> 14:18.050
He mugged my wife.

14:18.118 --> 14:19.285
Really?

14:19.353 --> 14:21.521
I'm sorry about that.

14:21.588 --> 14:23.589
I mean, it's just
luck of the draw.

14:23.657 --> 14:26.726
I mean, keep your chin up.

14:35.035 --> 14:37.670
That was my wife!
That was my wife!

14:37.738 --> 14:39.839
Come on! Let me go!

14:42.843 --> 14:45.111
Shouldn't my lawyer be here if
you're going to talk to me?

14:45.179 --> 14:46.612
Three's a crowd, love.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.614
Excuse me?
Don't get me wrong.

14:48.682 --> 14:51.250
She's a terrific lawyer.

14:51.318 --> 14:54.821
She's really top-notch.
And I mean that.

14:54.888 --> 14:58.124
Seems there's a lot of chemistry
there between you and your ex-wife.

14:58.192 --> 15:00.359
Well, there's a lot
of chemistry in chernobyl.

15:03.297 --> 15:04.664
You know what's interesting,
Dr. Lightman.

15:04.731 --> 15:06.098
We both have something
in common.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.200
Oh yeah.

15:07.267 --> 15:09.535
We both married up.

15:09.603 --> 15:11.370
Hah.

15:11.438 --> 15:14.040
You really miss him, do you?

15:14.107 --> 15:15.141
Victor?

15:15.209 --> 15:16.442
You're the expert.

15:16.510 --> 15:19.445
When I say I loved
my husband, what do you see?

15:19.513 --> 15:22.782
Well, you can love a man
and kill him.

15:22.850 --> 15:25.084
Or have him killed.

15:28.021 --> 15:29.889
Look me in the eye

15:29.957 --> 15:33.159
And tell me you believe
I killed my husband.

15:40.434 --> 15:43.402
Tell me about those 40 minutes

15:43.470 --> 15:46.005
You can't remember.

15:46.073 --> 15:49.242
Find whoever murdered Victor and
I'll tell you whatever you want.

15:49.309 --> 15:51.177
Oh, I see.
You got someone in mind then.

15:51.245 --> 15:53.579
Victor gave me more
than I ever wanted.

15:53.647 --> 15:55.348
We were partners in everything.

15:55.415 --> 15:56.883
All the charities.

15:56.950 --> 15:59.819
I converted to catholicism so I
could share that with him too.

15:59.887 --> 16:00.987
Why would I end that?

16:02.890 --> 16:04.557
What the hell is going on?!

16:04.625 --> 16:06.659
I'm tampering with your client.

16:06.727 --> 16:07.860
Are you always this relentless?

16:07.928 --> 16:10.730
To the point
of self-destruction. Officer!

16:12.299 --> 16:14.000
You wanted your father's
money, didn't you?!

16:14.067 --> 16:15.501
You were desperate
and you wanted his money

16:15.569 --> 16:17.236
So, you framed your stepmother.

16:17.304 --> 16:18.371
The hell I did!
That's crazy!

16:18.438 --> 16:20.106
See, that's wrong.

16:20.173 --> 16:23.543
I mean the worst thing you can do is
match your questioner's intensity.

16:23.610 --> 16:26.579
Instead give a firm,
deliberate answer.

16:26.647 --> 16:28.514
Here, watch.

16:30.217 --> 16:32.318
The reforms I'm proposing

16:32.386 --> 16:34.053
Would not apply to those
who are here illegally.

16:34.121 --> 16:35.521
You lie!

16:38.425 --> 16:39.659
It's not true.

16:39.726 --> 16:44.030
The president clenches his jaw,
slight hints of anger,

16:44.097 --> 16:48.100
But then he modulates his voice
and folds his hands. Ok.

16:48.168 --> 16:52.071
Now, Mr. O'Sullivan,
did you murder Victor Musso?

16:52.139 --> 16:53.406
Certainly not.

16:53.473 --> 16:55.708
Good. Simple. Direct.

16:55.776 --> 16:57.176
Truthful.

16:57.244 --> 17:00.146
See, I know how to handle myself
under pressure, Dr. Foster.

17:00.213 --> 17:03.249
I was Vic's right hand
for 25 years.

17:03.317 --> 17:06.452
Riding his coattails
for 25 years.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.355
I was cfo for
a "fortune 500" company.

17:10.991 --> 17:12.124
One last tip.

17:12.192 --> 17:15.461
Women require more eye
contact than men

17:15.529 --> 17:16.529
To feel a connection.

17:16.597 --> 17:19.665
So, I want you both
to focus your attention

17:19.733 --> 17:22.134
On the female jurors.

17:22.202 --> 17:23.769
Got it?

17:23.837 --> 17:26.638
Anything to put
that gold-digger away.

17:26.707 --> 17:29.475
Where was that loyalty
when your father was alive?

17:29.543 --> 17:31.644
Hey, she came onto me, ok?!

17:39.586 --> 17:43.022
Well, since it was my client
you illegally tampered with,

17:43.090 --> 17:44.690
Judge Quinn has given me
the authority

17:44.758 --> 17:46.592
To either keep you in here
or release you.

17:46.660 --> 17:49.128
Oh yeah? You bought her
a drink or 3 then?

17:49.196 --> 17:51.797
Give me one good reason I should
let you out of here.

17:51.865 --> 17:52.999
One good reason, all right.

17:53.066 --> 17:55.301
Yeah. Just one.
Well...

17:55.369 --> 17:59.572
How about you need me?

18:01.642 --> 18:05.077
You know, a room like this in our
house could have saved our marriage.

18:07.047 --> 18:08.748
Goodbye, Cal.

18:12.653 --> 18:15.421
Your client's innocent,
by the way.

18:15.489 --> 18:18.491
I found out while I was
tampering with her.

18:18.558 --> 18:20.426
Think I'll take a nap.

18:23.730 --> 18:25.931
Don't pretend you don't
need my help, Cal.

18:27.868 --> 18:29.001
Why do you do it?

18:29.069 --> 18:30.269
Do what?

18:30.337 --> 18:32.138
You know, keep forcing us
together like this.

18:32.205 --> 18:33.873
Paging Dr. Kinsey.

18:33.940 --> 18:37.610
Do you want
to switch to my side?

18:37.678 --> 18:38.811
What? And stop all this fun
we're having here?

18:38.879 --> 18:40.546
You must be joking.

18:40.614 --> 18:43.416
The fact of the matter is,
your client's innocent

18:43.483 --> 18:45.184
And the jury are about
to convict her.

18:45.252 --> 18:46.686
No, they're not.
Yeah, they are.

18:46.753 --> 18:47.787
Please.

18:47.854 --> 18:48.854
Fair enough.
You're the boss.

18:48.922 --> 18:50.056
Stop it.

18:50.123 --> 18:51.857
A little role playing
never hurt anyone.

18:52.893 --> 18:54.794
I should let you rot in here.

18:54.861 --> 18:57.496
Can't argue
with you there, darling.

19:00.534 --> 19:02.501
Marshall, here's the authorization

19:02.569 --> 19:06.017
For what I'm sure
will be a huge mistake.

19:09.990 --> 19:11.091
Clara didn't care about me.

19:11.158 --> 19:12.359
She didn't care
about my father.

19:12.426 --> 19:13.727
She just wanted his money.

19:13.794 --> 19:18.331
All right, let's pretend
the jury's watching. Ok?

19:18.399 --> 19:21.801
Now, tell them exactly
how Clara seduced you.

19:23.170 --> 19:25.872
It was a week after
she had interviewed my dad

19:25.940 --> 19:29.075
About the clinics
he built in Africa.

19:29.143 --> 19:30.710
She was at our ranch.

19:30.778 --> 19:33.280
I didn't know that they
had already become involved.

19:33.347 --> 19:34.481
She wanted a tour.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.816
I was showing
her the wine cellar.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.218
And that's when it happened.

19:38.286 --> 19:40.587
All right. That was good
eye contact and posture, Damien.

19:40.655 --> 19:44.524
But remember, fold your hands
to avoid fidgeting.

19:44.592 --> 19:46.092
Got it.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.494
How many times
did you have sex?

19:50.398 --> 19:52.832
Maybe 6 or 7.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.036
The maybe undercuts your
credibility with the jurors.

19:56.103 --> 19:58.905
Especially with these 2.

19:58.973 --> 19:59.906
All right.

19:59.974 --> 20:01.474
Give them a specific number.

20:01.542 --> 20:03.610
7.

20:03.678 --> 20:06.279
But when she found out
that I didn't have any money

20:06.347 --> 20:08.748
And that it was all in
a trust until I was 40,

20:08.816 --> 20:10.951
She dumped me.
The next thing I know,

20:11.018 --> 20:13.253
She's engaged to my father.

20:13.321 --> 20:15.922
And he is changing his will.

20:15.990 --> 20:18.825
Where was the last place
you and Clara had sex?

20:21.128 --> 20:23.496
I don't know.
They all kind of run together.

20:23.564 --> 20:27.467
Let's get some caffeine.
It always helps me focus.

20:33.541 --> 20:36.242
So, tell me what happened
in the wine cellar.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.244
I was showing her my dad's
collection,

20:38.312 --> 20:40.880
And she asked
to see my belt buckle.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.216
And you took it off or did she?

20:43.284 --> 20:44.384
She did.

20:46.721 --> 20:48.722
Help yourself.

20:49.991 --> 20:51.758
All right,
you just watch the images.

20:51.826 --> 20:55.495
And we'll monitor your
reactions on the outside.

20:55.563 --> 20:57.097
Give me the finger.

20:57.164 --> 20:59.165
Ah, that's charming isn't it?

20:59.233 --> 21:01.368
Are you this hands-on
with all your clients?

21:01.435 --> 21:04.371
Well, I'm not afraid to get a
little dirty when necessary.

21:04.438 --> 21:05.505
Hmm.

21:05.573 --> 21:06.673
All right, so you...

21:06.741 --> 21:08.241
Say you didn't kill
your husband.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.542
I believe you're innocent.

21:09.610 --> 21:12.278
Well, I can't say this feels
like a vote of confidence.

21:14.115 --> 21:16.516
Well, you still don't remember
what happened that night,

21:16.584 --> 21:20.420
So, a few faces from the
case might jog your memory.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.323
Have fun.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.428
How is this supposed
to help jog her memory?

21:28.496 --> 21:30.263
It's not.
It's nonsense.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.999
But since she's lying to us
about those 40 minutes,

21:33.067 --> 21:34.768
We're coming at it
from another angle.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.202
Oh, flag that one.

21:38.239 --> 21:40.040
Contempt when
she looks at Damien.

21:40.107 --> 21:42.242
Well, your stepson
says you're sleeping together

21:42.309 --> 21:44.444
The same time you're bedding
daddy-- that can bring contempt.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.713
Yeah, and in my country, a new
member of the royal family.

21:46.781 --> 21:47.781
Flag that one.

21:49.483 --> 21:51.451
Push in on her hand.

21:52.453 --> 21:53.486
Ooh.

21:53.554 --> 21:55.922
Who's that woman
she's reacting to?

21:55.990 --> 21:58.024
That's Tanya Wilson.
It's a close friend of Clara's.

21:58.092 --> 22:00.794
She comes to court every day
to support her.

22:00.861 --> 22:04.330
Well, that hand closing like
that...Is anger.

22:07.735 --> 22:10.136
What happened in the
40 minutes you left Victor?

22:10.204 --> 22:11.838
What--I--I don't remember.

22:11.906 --> 22:12.906
That's bullocks, Clara.

22:12.973 --> 22:14.074
Do you know who killed
your husband?

22:14.141 --> 22:15.909
You know I don't.
That's enough, Cal.

22:15.976 --> 22:17.410
Too right it is.

22:17.478 --> 22:18.878
You're lying.
I can't help ya.

22:28.155 --> 22:30.123
Uncooperative witness--
that's common.

22:30.191 --> 22:32.325
Uncooperative client--
that's rare.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.127
Well, Crosby hired us
as experts.

22:34.195 --> 22:36.296
Can't you just tell her
you're sure she didn't do it?

22:36.363 --> 22:38.765
It's a matter of pride
for Crosby at this point.

22:38.833 --> 22:41.935
You know, what passes
for truth in a courtroom

22:42.002 --> 22:44.337
Isn't necessarily
the whole truth.

22:44.405 --> 22:45.739
I love you too.

22:45.806 --> 22:47.474
Out.

22:49.343 --> 22:51.978
Clara was trying to hide her
anger toward Tanya.

22:52.046 --> 22:53.413
Yeah, I need some background
on that one.

22:53.481 --> 22:55.615
Right. And we saw Clara's
contempt for Damien.

22:55.683 --> 22:58.852
What does she say about her
affair with him?

22:58.919 --> 23:00.987
She's adamant
it never happened.

23:01.055 --> 23:02.222
Damien came onto her.
She said no.

23:02.289 --> 23:04.124
It's he said, she said.

23:04.191 --> 23:06.559
When I was prepping him, I asked them
about their last sexual encounter,

23:06.627 --> 23:08.094
And he just stood there
holding a pot of coffee.

23:08.162 --> 23:11.197
I mean, he couldn't fill his cup
while giving the details.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.333
Manual tasks are harder to integrate
when you're faking a story.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.002
Yeah, but I believed him
the first time around.

23:16.070 --> 23:18.938
What if his story is
an obsessive fantasy?

23:19.006 --> 23:20.640
If he played it out
in his head enough,

23:20.708 --> 23:23.943
He could have said it really happened
without showing any signs of deception.

23:24.011 --> 23:27.447
So, Clara rejects Damien
for his father,

23:27.515 --> 23:28.948
Who's shadow he lives in.

23:29.016 --> 23:29.983
It could have driven him
to murder.

23:30.050 --> 23:32.385
We need to get Damien
back in here.

23:33.387 --> 23:34.654
Now, that's dangerous.

23:34.722 --> 23:36.055
Hmm.

23:36.123 --> 23:39.058
You think I need more prep work
before I testify?

23:39.126 --> 23:42.862
There are a few more techniques Dr.
Lightman wants to go over.

23:42.930 --> 23:44.931
Anything for my father.

23:58.245 --> 24:00.580
You slut.

24:03.818 --> 24:06.553
That's pure science.
How was it?

24:06.620 --> 24:07.587
All right, come on.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.656
Damien!
Damien, you lied!

24:09.723 --> 24:12.158
You were never involved
with Clara were you?

24:12.226 --> 24:13.159
She seduced me!

24:13.227 --> 24:14.194
You're pathetic, Damien.

24:14.261 --> 24:15.495
You're pathetic!

24:15.563 --> 24:16.663
How could you do this?!

24:16.730 --> 24:18.198
We wanted to see
how angry it made you

24:18.265 --> 24:19.566
To see her with somebody else.

24:19.633 --> 24:20.900
You think I killed my father?!

24:20.968 --> 24:22.802
No. No. But you've been lying
about an innocent woman.

24:22.870 --> 24:24.137
She is a gold-digger!

24:24.205 --> 24:25.138
How can you say that?!

24:25.206 --> 24:26.239
This was your plan all along!

24:26.307 --> 24:27.574
I loved your father more
than anything!

24:27.641 --> 24:28.741
No, you used him!
You wanted--

24:28.809 --> 24:30.109
Ohh! Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!

24:30.177 --> 24:31.277
Hey!

24:31.345 --> 24:33.213
Let's go!

24:35.216 --> 24:36.349
Let it go.

24:36.417 --> 24:39.519
Fair enough.

24:39.587 --> 24:41.921
I expected a little bit
more than a slap

24:41.989 --> 24:44.624
From the world's most
notorious murder suspect.

24:44.692 --> 24:48.127
Yeah. Well, I guess I've been
respectable for too long.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.263
I think I can help you
with that.

24:55.878 --> 24:58.346
Hey, doc, Damien Musso called
my office this morning.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.381
He said you all but accused
him of murder.

25:00.449 --> 25:03.651
Well, Clara didn't kill
her husband, right?

25:03.719 --> 25:05.753
I see. You switched sides.

25:05.821 --> 25:08.256
I mean, how can I compete with
legs, cleavage & associates.

25:08.323 --> 25:09.757
You can't.

25:09.825 --> 25:11.192
You must be cleavage.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.728
Well, legs here is twice
the lawyer you're ever gonna be.

25:13.796 --> 25:14.962
Hah.

25:15.030 --> 25:17.699
You know that affair Damien
said he had with Clara?

25:17.766 --> 25:20.368
He was lying. Call him to the stand.
It's perjury.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.637
We had a contract, doc.

25:22.705 --> 25:24.539
Look, I render my services
as an expert.

25:24.606 --> 25:28.242
We prepped your witnesses for ya.
We read your jury. Job done.

25:28.310 --> 25:31.279
Well, it's going to be a long time before
you get any business from my office.

25:31.346 --> 25:32.980
I'm devastated.

25:33.048 --> 25:34.682
Really?
Yeah.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.651
I'll see you in there,
counselor.

25:38.854 --> 25:40.021
That's interesting.

25:40.089 --> 25:41.189
What?

25:41.256 --> 25:42.857
He's not worried
at all about Damien.

25:42.925 --> 25:46.527
And, uh, he doesn't give a toss about
me coming over to the other side.

25:46.595 --> 25:49.097
If anything,
he's more confident than usual.

25:49.164 --> 25:51.599
He's up to something.

25:51.667 --> 25:53.868
Mr. O'Sullivan, why did you
hire a private investigator

25:53.936 --> 25:55.236
To look into Clara's past?

25:55.304 --> 25:58.406
I'd been friends with Victor
since we were 10 years old

25:58.474 --> 26:00.608
In catechism at st. Bernard's.

26:00.676 --> 26:04.645
When I realized Victor was
getting serious about Clara,

26:04.713 --> 26:07.949
I wanted to make sure her
intentions were sincere--

26:08.016 --> 26:11.452
As a friend first
and as a business partner.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.089
And did the investigator
find anything criminal?

26:15.157 --> 26:18.426
No. She reinvented
herself though.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.829
New name. New hair color.
New resume.

26:21.897 --> 26:23.664
Well, breaking with the past
isn't always easy.

26:23.732 --> 26:26.300
To your knowledge, was Victor
happy in his marriage?

26:26.368 --> 26:29.070
Yes. But he didn't have
all the facts.

26:29.138 --> 26:32.073
Reviewing the estate yesterday,
I discovered something--

26:32.141 --> 26:34.442
Objection, your honor.
Any information he has about the estate

26:34.510 --> 26:35.676
Should have been brought
forth in deposition.

26:35.744 --> 26:39.113
Are you certain that you made
the discovery yesterday?

26:39.181 --> 26:40.581
Yes. I'm certain.

26:40.649 --> 26:43.084
No, he's lying, your honor.

26:44.586 --> 26:46.354
He's been sitting on it.
So has the D.A.

26:48.490 --> 26:49.524
That's absurd.

26:49.591 --> 26:51.292
Your honor, I move to
clear the whole gallery.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.662
Muzzle your ex, Ms. Landau,
or I will.

26:56.064 --> 26:58.332
Proceed with your finding.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.368
When I looked at Victor's
sub-accounts,

27:00.435 --> 27:04.505
I discovered monthly withdrawals
of roughly $90,000,

27:04.573 --> 27:07.008
Spread across the last year
and a half.

27:07.075 --> 27:09.811
Clara was stealing from him.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.285
He's not lying.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.588
Motion for recess, your honor.

27:20.656 --> 27:22.223
I need time to research
these claims.

27:22.291 --> 27:26.093
You can recall the witness when
prosecution rests, Ms. Landau.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.097
You're leaving?

27:30.165 --> 27:31.265
Yeah. That jury's
12 to nothing to convict.

27:31.333 --> 27:33.935
You're screwed.

27:37.673 --> 27:39.507
So, if Clara stole money
from her husband,

27:39.575 --> 27:41.008
Why did we switch sides.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.710
Lightman screwed up?

27:42.778 --> 27:45.279
Well, Foster always says, the closer
you are to someone emotionally,

27:45.347 --> 27:46.848
The harder it is to get
a true read.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.616
Yeah, but Clara is a stranger.

27:48.684 --> 27:52.253
Zoe isn't. Anything she touches, Lightman
is going to bring baggage to it.

27:52.321 --> 27:55.723
Hey, speaking of baggage, you
want to unload some of your own,

27:55.791 --> 27:57.258
Like that memory
that Lightman saw?

27:57.326 --> 27:58.793
Loker.
What?

27:58.861 --> 28:00.061
What kind of age difference are
we talking about here? 10 years?

28:00.128 --> 28:02.096
We're not discussing this.

28:02.164 --> 28:03.698
Did you violate state laws
or something?

28:03.765 --> 28:04.999
No.

28:05.067 --> 28:07.301
Decency laws?

28:07.369 --> 28:10.571
It was a totally legal
and healthy relationship.

28:10.639 --> 28:12.506
That's exciting. Come on.
Give me something.

28:12.574 --> 28:14.976
What are you hiding?
At least give me his name.

28:17.813 --> 28:20.014
Denise Watson.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.890
Tanya Wilson,
as I live and breathe.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.458
Clara's best mate.

28:30.525 --> 28:32.560
Why's she so angry
with you then?

28:32.628 --> 28:34.061
I didn't know that she was.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.764
Really?! How long
have you two been friends?

28:36.832 --> 28:37.999
I don't have to talk to you.

28:38.066 --> 28:39.333
That's true.
That's true.

28:39.401 --> 28:41.269
But I'll see to that
while you explain to a jury

28:41.336 --> 28:43.504
Why you got so scared
when Leo testified

28:43.572 --> 28:46.107
That Clara was stealing
from her husband.

28:46.174 --> 28:49.310
I was scared for Clara
as a friend.

28:49.378 --> 28:51.879
Ahh. Were you two
in it together?

28:51.947 --> 28:53.748
Were your robbing
the old man blind.

28:53.815 --> 28:57.485
As I was going through a tough time.
Clara was helping me out.

28:57.552 --> 28:59.820
See, there's that fear again.

28:59.888 --> 29:03.024
I think you're hiding something.

29:03.091 --> 29:06.594
I think you're here just to make
sure she keeps her mouth shut.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.129
Ridiculous.

29:08.196 --> 29:09.864
I smell blackmail.

29:09.932 --> 29:12.133
Of a sexual variety.
What is it?

29:12.200 --> 29:13.935
Is it you and Clara?

29:14.002 --> 29:16.203
You and Victor?

29:16.271 --> 29:18.172
No, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.
Three's a crowd, right?

29:18.240 --> 29:22.076
You and Victor and Clara.

29:23.378 --> 29:25.479
What you got on him?
You got photos?

29:25.547 --> 29:26.914
You got video?

29:26.982 --> 29:28.282
You got dirty knickers?

29:28.350 --> 29:29.850
I had nothing to do
with his death.

29:29.918 --> 29:32.286
My money's on video.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.588
I think you got a sex tape.

29:34.656 --> 29:38.192
About 90 grand a month's worth.

29:41.430 --> 29:43.097
Clara met him through me.

29:43.165 --> 29:45.132
Her life was supposed
to be mine.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.968
It's not like they were
going to miss it.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.804
Well, thanks for that.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.708
Now, if you want
to stay out of jail,

29:53.775 --> 29:55.576
I'm gonna need that sex tape.

30:02.238 --> 30:03.371
It was Vic's 60th birthday,

30:03.439 --> 30:05.672
And I wanted to do something
he'd never forget.

30:05.940 --> 30:07.707
In every other way
he was conservative.

30:07.775 --> 30:09.042
But this was a fantasy of his.

30:09.110 --> 30:10.710
So, Tanya and I got together.

30:10.778 --> 30:14.181
We were friends at that
point or so I thought.

30:14.248 --> 30:17.217
So, those 40 minutes that
you claim you can't remember--

30:17.285 --> 30:18.552
All right--

30:18.619 --> 30:21.822
That's when you nipped out
to pay off Tanya. Yeah?

30:24.725 --> 30:28.295
It was meant to stop.
But when I got there,

30:28.362 --> 30:31.898
She said that the payments
were going to keep going.

30:31.966 --> 30:34.134
But you couldn't tell your
husband about the blackmail?

30:34.202 --> 30:36.570
Or your lawyer?

30:36.637 --> 30:38.939
It would have confirmed everything
that people had been saying about me.

30:39.006 --> 30:41.274
And his reputation meant
the world to him.

30:41.342 --> 30:44.911
You're willing to go to jail
to preserve that reputation?

30:47.748 --> 30:49.149
True love.

30:49.217 --> 30:50.884
I know.
It's absolute insanity.

30:50.952 --> 30:52.452
Hmm.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.688
I'm innocent, Zoe.

30:54.755 --> 30:58.859
And I thought maybe you could
somehow make the jury see that.

30:58.926 --> 31:01.061
Well, speaking of the jury,
we've been reading them,

31:01.128 --> 31:05.065
And they're 12 to nothing
to convict.

31:05.132 --> 31:06.867
I mean, it's one thing
to say you're innocent.

31:06.934 --> 31:09.669
But, you gotta show them
who's guilty.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.137
Well, we know we can
rule out Damien.

31:11.205 --> 31:13.173
Who else has access
to your house?

31:13.241 --> 31:15.475
The only other person
with a key was Leo.

31:15.543 --> 31:16.610
He just smeared you in court.

31:16.677 --> 31:17.878
I was stealing.

31:17.945 --> 31:18.945
He stands
to benefit financially

31:19.013 --> 31:20.046
If you're convicted.

31:20.114 --> 31:21.581
He's the executor
of the estate.

31:21.649 --> 31:24.518
There is no way. Vic and Leo were
more than business partners.

31:24.585 --> 31:25.619
They were like brothers.

31:25.686 --> 31:28.054
Yeah, well so was brutus
and Caesar.

31:29.123 --> 31:31.291
Put me back on the stand again.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.628
What?

31:49.076 --> 31:51.077
Just ask, Loker.

31:52.179 --> 31:53.813
So, you sleep with women too?

31:53.881 --> 31:56.416
Wow.

31:56.484 --> 31:58.552
You just went to
a whole new level of blunt.

31:58.619 --> 32:01.821
Well, it has serious
ramifications.

32:01.889 --> 32:04.257
My competition
may have just doubled.

32:05.326 --> 32:07.394
I was curious, ok?

32:07.461 --> 32:12.332
Denise was funny
and interesting.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.400
And I liked her smile.

32:13.467 --> 32:14.968
Mm-hmm.

32:15.036 --> 32:16.303
I didn't make a life choice.

32:16.370 --> 32:17.537
Right.

32:17.605 --> 32:19.139
So, just to confirm.

32:19.206 --> 32:21.207
Not bisexual then.

32:21.275 --> 32:23.643
It was experimenting, Loker.

32:23.711 --> 32:25.145
Ok.

32:25.212 --> 32:27.581
And you know, why can girls
do it and guys can't?

32:27.648 --> 32:29.916
Where's the fantasy in that?

32:33.888 --> 32:36.990
Anyways, who really cares what
people do in their bedrooms.

32:37.058 --> 32:38.925
Everyone.

32:42.897 --> 32:44.431
So...

32:46.400 --> 32:49.069
This experiment.

32:50.671 --> 32:53.006
What were your findings?

32:53.074 --> 32:54.774
You know,
scientifically speaking.

33:05.119 --> 33:08.288
You hold yourself out as
an arbiter of people's honesty,

33:08.356 --> 33:11.424
Yet time and again you've
reversed yourself, Dr. Lightman.

33:11.492 --> 33:15.762
Yeah. Yeah, well, scientists,
see, they admit their mistakes.

33:15.830 --> 33:20.200
Ex-wives--that's an entirely
different story.

33:20.267 --> 33:22.702
The fact is your science is
completely unreliable.

33:22.770 --> 33:25.138
I mean, you're a glorified
fortuneteller. A hack.

33:25.206 --> 33:28.041
All right, well, let's see if
the jury agrees, shall we?

33:28.109 --> 33:31.211
The foreman, he's high as a kite,
and he has been all along.

33:31.278 --> 33:34.547
That one, she's getting off
on Clara's misery, she is.

33:34.615 --> 33:36.549
And those 2 over there,
they're having an affair.

33:36.617 --> 33:38.251
They're doing the dirty back
at the hotel.

33:38.319 --> 33:40.086
Both of them married
to different people.

33:40.154 --> 33:43.490
And that one has got
a serious foot fetish.

33:43.557 --> 33:45.325
Dr. Lightman,
for God's sake!

33:45.393 --> 33:48.328
Well, no. My point is
I can read anyone here.

33:48.396 --> 33:52.065
Right. Not just
the defendant or the judge.

33:52.133 --> 33:56.269
If you're hiding something,
I'll know it.

33:56.337 --> 33:59.773
And yet you never turn that scrutiny on yourself, Dr.
Lightman. Why is that?

33:59.840 --> 34:02.475
That would terrify you,
wouldn't it?

34:02.543 --> 34:05.245
To be striped bare the way you
strip the people around you.

34:05.312 --> 34:07.747
I'm not a killer, counselor.

34:07.815 --> 34:09.282
But neither is Clara Musso.

34:09.350 --> 34:11.284
Move to strike, your honor.

34:11.351 --> 34:12.284
Sustained.

34:12.353 --> 34:13.520
The real killer has been hiding

34:13.587 --> 34:15.588
In plain sight all along.

34:15.656 --> 34:17.322
He's in this very courtroom
as we speak.

34:17.391 --> 34:18.658
Objection! Speculation!

34:18.726 --> 34:20.360
Dr. Lightman, this court
has indulged you

34:20.428 --> 34:23.228
More than enough.
Step down now, please.

34:23.297 --> 34:25.764
Please. Please step down
before I have you arrested.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.667
If you're gonna
arrest somebody,

34:27.735 --> 34:29.536
You should arrest
Leo O'Sullivan.

34:30.737 --> 34:32.338
He killed his best friend,
right, Leo?!

34:32.406 --> 34:34.440
Marshall,
remove him from the court.

34:34.507 --> 34:38.210
You bastard! I didn't murder Vic.
I'd never!

34:38.279 --> 34:39.946
Oh, that's the truth, see.
You didn't murder him,

34:40.014 --> 34:42.014
But you did kill him,
didn't you?

34:42.083 --> 34:44.150
All right. I'll calm down.

34:51.292 --> 34:52.559
What does that mean--

34:52.626 --> 34:54.761
Leo killed Victor
but he didn't murder him?

34:54.829 --> 34:56.329
Well, when he said
he didn't murder Victor,

34:56.397 --> 34:57.864
There was no sign of
deception, right?

34:57.932 --> 35:02.669
But when I asked him if he killed
his friend, he flashed regret.

35:02.737 --> 35:05.004
Look, if I recall Leo
to the stand--

35:05.072 --> 35:06.372
We crack the case.

35:06.440 --> 35:11.144
He's right on the edge.
He just needs one more shove.

35:11.212 --> 35:12.879
Spit it out then.

35:12.947 --> 35:16.649
Well, since you asked.
When is killing your friend a good thing?

35:25.019 --> 35:27.487
Please be seated.

35:30.958 --> 35:33.728
I thought I kicked your ex-husband
out of my courtroom, counselor?

35:34.296 --> 35:37.364
Dr. Lightman is essential for my
client's defense, your honor.

35:37.432 --> 35:39.333
He's just here to observe.

35:39.401 --> 35:40.634
He won't be a nuisance
to the court.

35:40.702 --> 35:43.437
Well, if he is, he will be
the guest of the county

35:43.505 --> 35:44.972
For the next 30 days.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.074
Are we clear, Dr. Lightman?

35:47.142 --> 35:48.776
As a bell, your honor.

35:48.843 --> 35:51.011
Proceed.

35:51.079 --> 35:54.515
Mr. O'Sullivan, I wish to remind
you that you are still under oath.

35:58.520 --> 36:02.122
I'd like to apologize
for the previous outburst.

36:02.190 --> 36:03.891
It's clear to me and to
everyone in this courtroom

36:03.959 --> 36:05.826
How close you were
to Victor Musso.

36:05.894 --> 36:08.729
You were his best friend,
his lifelong confidant.

36:08.797 --> 36:10.965
And you would do anything
to protect him.

36:11.032 --> 36:12.499
And his reputation.

36:12.567 --> 36:14.068
That's true.

36:14.135 --> 36:16.303
I'd like to show the witness
some photos, if I may.

36:16.371 --> 36:17.838
Objection!
No. No. You can't.

36:17.906 --> 36:20.341
There were no pictures
submitted during discovery.

36:20.408 --> 36:21.909
Easy love, jury's watching.

36:21.977 --> 36:23.310
Sidebar, your honor?

36:23.378 --> 36:24.778
Please.

36:26.715 --> 36:28.749
You can't let them see
those pictures.

36:28.817 --> 36:30.317
Everything Vic worked
for would be ruined.

36:30.385 --> 36:33.287
If you try and stop this, I'll
do those 30 days with bells on,

36:33.355 --> 36:35.356
Just after I finish blurting it
out to the jury.

36:37.158 --> 36:40.894
These could do irreparable harm to
the reputation of the deceased.

36:48.803 --> 36:50.504
I don't know how this is
germane to the case.

36:50.572 --> 36:54.141
It speaks to the accusation that
Clara was stealing from her husband.

36:54.209 --> 36:56.877
I don't want to besmirch
a good man if I don't have to.

36:56.945 --> 36:59.680
But I do reserve the right
to present these in open court.

36:59.748 --> 37:01.949
I take your point, counselor.

37:02.017 --> 37:03.050
All right.
Please.

37:03.118 --> 37:04.785
Thank you.

37:06.621 --> 37:09.490
You want to see Clara Musso
locked up for murder.

37:09.557 --> 37:11.859
She betrayed
a man who loved her.

37:11.926 --> 37:14.528
She was sleeping
with his son for God sakes.

37:14.596 --> 37:15.729
Well, thanks
to Dr. Lightman,

37:15.797 --> 37:16.830
That's been exposed as a lie.

37:16.898 --> 37:18.565
She was stealing from him.

37:18.633 --> 37:21.502
Which you knew about.
And yet you never said a word.

37:21.569 --> 37:24.271
He was completely
under her spell.

37:24.339 --> 37:25.906
I was protecting him.

37:25.974 --> 37:29.043
Well, I submit to you that
Clara was doing the same.

37:29.110 --> 37:30.411
Protecting him.

37:30.478 --> 37:32.746
And the money you say my
client was stealing from him

37:32.814 --> 37:35.916
Was in fact being put
to a good and noble cause.

37:35.984 --> 37:38.852
Am I being clear enough
here, Mr. O'Sullivan?

37:38.920 --> 37:42.823
Perfectly, counselor.

37:44.459 --> 37:46.760
You also knew she didn't
kill her husband, sir.

37:46.828 --> 37:49.463
But you thought she deserved to
go to prison anyway, didn't you?

37:49.531 --> 37:52.399
Because after all, you had built
a company and a reputation

37:52.467 --> 37:54.635
Side-by-side with Victor
for 25 years.

37:54.702 --> 37:58.305
And overnight, your best friend
became a different person.

37:58.373 --> 38:00.607
Clara had displaced you.

38:00.675 --> 38:03.210
No! When it mattered,
Vic called me.

38:03.278 --> 38:05.779
There we go. Watch this.

38:05.847 --> 38:08.248
Hold on to your seat, love.

38:08.316 --> 38:10.784
Like when
it came to his health?

38:10.852 --> 38:12.386
That's fear.

38:12.454 --> 38:14.054
But without shame.

38:14.122 --> 38:15.956
He's proud of what he did.

38:17.992 --> 38:20.961
You didn't murder him, Leo.

38:21.029 --> 38:23.564
He asked you to end
his life, didn't he?

38:23.631 --> 38:25.299
Objection!

38:25.366 --> 38:26.600
Overruled.

38:28.169 --> 38:30.637
How was Mr. Musso's health
just prior to his death?

38:30.705 --> 38:32.172
You're under oath.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.174
He was...

38:35.477 --> 38:38.011
Secretly very sick.

38:38.079 --> 38:40.414
And that's why he wanted you
to help him end his life,

38:40.482 --> 38:41.915
To assist his suicide.
Isn't that right?

38:41.983 --> 38:43.450
Objection, your honor!

38:43.518 --> 38:46.386
The court is very interested
in Mr. O'Sullivan's answer.

38:46.454 --> 38:48.856
He had a degenerative
brain disease.

38:48.923 --> 38:52.926
Doctors gave him
a month or two.

38:52.994 --> 38:55.963
You bought the cyanide
and the syringe.

38:56.030 --> 38:57.431
He called you to his home.

38:57.499 --> 39:00.801
And you gave him that
injection, didn't you?

39:00.869 --> 39:02.870
Your honor!
Take your seat.

39:04.772 --> 39:06.440
Victor was devout.

39:06.508 --> 39:10.611
I mean, to him suicide
was a mortal sin.

39:12.947 --> 39:15.716
I couldn't say no to my friend.

39:15.783 --> 39:18.318
Which is why you never told
him that Clara was stealing.

39:18.386 --> 39:20.521
Because he was dying.

39:20.588 --> 39:23.690
Why break his heart on top
of everything else?

39:23.758 --> 39:25.559
Do you have proof
it wasn't a murder?

39:31.499 --> 39:33.734
He left a video explaining.

39:33.801 --> 39:36.703
Now that right there.

39:36.771 --> 39:38.405
That is shame.

39:40.241 --> 39:43.744
I think his widow has
a right to see that.

39:46.581 --> 39:50.217
But I didn't imagine
that I'd meet a woman

39:50.285 --> 39:53.420
Who would understand me
so completely.

39:53.488 --> 39:56.223
Our marriage was a gift, Clara.

39:56.291 --> 39:59.426
Happiest 10 years of my life.

39:59.494 --> 40:02.462
I wouldn't let anything
tarnish that.

40:02.530 --> 40:05.399
Zoe says that Leo
is pleading guilty

40:05.466 --> 40:07.801
To obstruction
of justice and manslaughter.

40:07.869 --> 40:09.970
And they're working out a deal.

40:10.038 --> 40:11.705
That's good then.

40:13.975 --> 40:15.742
Thank you for everything.

40:17.345 --> 40:20.113
I should have
trusted you sooner.

40:20.181 --> 40:22.115
Well, I could say
the same thing.

40:26.487 --> 40:29.823
I've got a meeting waiting.

40:37.332 --> 40:40.934
She's a beautiful woman.

40:41.002 --> 40:43.203
She's my Leo.

40:45.139 --> 40:47.107
What about Zoe?

40:47.175 --> 40:49.743
Well, to say you stopped
loving someone you once loved

40:49.811 --> 40:53.213
More than anything else in the
world, I mean that would be a lie.

40:53.281 --> 40:55.449
But you move on.

40:55.516 --> 40:57.084
Don't you?

40:57.151 --> 40:59.519
You have to move on.

41:02.290 --> 41:05.058
She's my daughter's mum.

41:07.161 --> 41:08.862
Sometimes sparring partner.

41:10.098 --> 41:12.833
Any other women
populating your life?

41:14.502 --> 41:16.737
None you need to worry about.

41:21.776 --> 41:23.610
I'm taking over Victor's
businesses and charities.

41:23.678 --> 41:25.078
Oh yeah?

41:25.146 --> 41:28.782
People are going to come
after me. They think I'm weak.

41:28.850 --> 41:30.450
I need someone I can trust.

41:30.518 --> 41:32.653
Well, you got my number.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.988
So, to speak.

41:39.727 --> 41:41.828
My point is, right,

41:41.896 --> 41:44.731
That the reason that we won

41:44.799 --> 41:46.266
Was because the whole truth
came out.

41:46.334 --> 41:49.936
Which--no, cause it doesn't
normally happen in a courtroom.

41:50.004 --> 41:51.338
Mm-hmm.

41:51.406 --> 41:53.440
Why'd you take this case?

41:53.508 --> 41:55.776
I thought it'd be a bit of fun.

41:55.843 --> 41:58.078
That's not it.
Not really.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.114
Well, it's your first
time out there.

42:01.182 --> 42:04.951
It's a big national case.

42:05.019 --> 42:06.720
You were protecting me?

42:06.788 --> 42:09.756
Oh, that's so sweet.

42:09.824 --> 42:11.925
And paternalistic
and patronizing.

42:11.993 --> 42:14.227
Yeah. You got a point there.
Hmm.

42:14.295 --> 42:17.397
No, but look. If you get
a guilty woman off,

42:17.465 --> 42:18.565
You're a punch line.

42:18.633 --> 42:21.702
If you convict an innocent
man, you're a joke.

42:21.769 --> 42:25.672
You've worked far too hard
to get where you are.

42:25.740 --> 42:29.242
You deserve a bit of respect.

42:29.310 --> 42:31.011
Not infamy.
