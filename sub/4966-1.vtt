04:03.910 --> 04:07.996
Derek.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.623
Derek.

04:09.832 --> 04:13.001
Fucking pervert, Dan.
- Jesus, what the fuck are you thinking?

04:13.169 --> 04:16.004
There's a black guy outside.
He's breaking into your car.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.800
How long's he been there?
- I don't know.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.344
What's going on?
- Not right now, honey. How many?

04:23.763 --> 04:26.181
- Danny, how many?
- One, I think.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.267
Is he strapped?

04:28.434 --> 04:31.436
- Does he have a fucking gun, Danny?
- Man, I don't fucking know.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.524
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on, Derek?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.442
- Stay right here and be quiet.
- Jesus.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.362
- Stay right here.
Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.989
Derek.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.742
Shh, shh, shh.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.411
They're right here.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.639
I don't have a personal problem
with him, okay?

06:31.349 --> 06:33.350
Don't insult my intelligence, Murray.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.311
You hate this child
and I think I know why.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.029
I went out with his mother a few times.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.323
That was three years ago. It was nothing.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.825
Nothing. Really? Hmm.

06:49.992 --> 06:53.120
That paper, Bob, it's a travesty.

06:53.287 --> 06:56.164
Arguing for Hitler as a civil-rights hero?

06:56.332 --> 06:57.749
You've gotta draw the line.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.001
Murray, you actually did this to yourself.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.629
You told them they could
do a report on any book...

07:02.797 --> 07:06.007
...that related to the struggle
for civil rights. In plain English.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.847
I am not disputing the fact that the child
is confused and harbors some sick ideas...

07:12.014 --> 07:14.641
...but I am not ready
to give up on him yet.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.436
His brother probably put him up to it.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.606
I can guarantee you 100 percent
his brother did not put him up to this.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.109
I find that hard to believe. Whatever.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.362
I know he was a good kid
and it's a shame what he's been through...

07:27.530 --> 07:29.781
...but that is dangerous.
- Dangerous in what way?

07:29.949 --> 07:32.617
Bob, that goes too far.

07:32.785 --> 07:36.413
This racist propaganda,
this Mein Kampf psychobabble?

07:36.581 --> 07:39.499
He learned this nonsense, Murray,
and he can unlearn it too.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.335
I will not give up on this child yet.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.023
- I knew it was you.
Danny, get in here.

08:03.191 --> 08:07.235
I said, get in here. Get in here!

08:07.403 --> 08:09.029
Five, four, three...

08:09.280 --> 08:11.990
...two... Shut the door.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.703
What's it gonna be, Danny?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.164
What's what gonna be?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.750
This petty crap you're pulling.

08:23.711 --> 08:24.753
I don't know.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.463
Have a seat.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.554
How you doing?

08:36.432 --> 08:38.183
Fine.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.602
Things at home okay?

08:41.645 --> 08:42.979
Yeah.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.276
Derek got out this morning, did he not?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.280
Yeah, he did.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.784
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

08:56.202 --> 08:59.621
Honors English.
He was a brilliant student.

09:00.289 --> 09:03.959
Like you. But he hung out
with simple-minded fools.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.294
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Also like you.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.922
Look, did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

09:09.090 --> 09:11.299
Because what happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.970
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.722
Look, I followed directions
and I wrote an A paper.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.976
"Mein Kampf"?

09:22.311 --> 09:24.479
- I should expel you.
- Go ahead.

09:24.647 --> 09:28.650
- You don't think I could handle it?
- No, I think the street would kill you.

09:28.818 --> 09:32.487
Your rhetoric and your propaganda
aren't gonna save you out there.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.907
So here's the drill.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.618
I'm your history teacher from now on.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.330
We will discuss current events.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.916
We will call this class...

09:46.127 --> 09:48.837
...American History X.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.840
We meet once a day.

09:52.049 --> 09:56.678
All right, your first assignment is to
prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.473
Oh, come on. It took me a week
to read Mein Kampf. That isn't fair.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.445
- What do you want me to do it on?
- Your brother.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.865
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.200
No, no, no. I'm not kidding.

10:20.036 --> 10:24.706
I want you to analyze and interpret all the
events surrounding Derek's incarceration.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.501
How these events helped shape
your present perspective...

10:28.669 --> 10:32.088
...concerning life
in contemporary America.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.007
The impact on your life.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.259
Your family's.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.930
Whatever you wanna say, Danny...

10:44.101 --> 10:46.394
...I'll be the only one reading it.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.065
But if it's not on my desk...

10:50.232 --> 10:52.025
...tomorrow morning...

10:52.777 --> 10:56.071
...you are a ghost at Venice Beach High.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.240
Are you clear?

11:00.117 --> 11:02.202
Yeah, I'm clear.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.250
Telling teacher I'm fucking cheating?

11:09.418 --> 11:11.544
Is that what's happening?

11:11.712 --> 11:14.839
- I never cheated in my life.
- Beat his motherfucking ass, Henry.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.759
- I didn't say anything.
- Why you tripping on me?

11:20.262 --> 11:22.764
Why you all kicking him like that?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.599
What's up, man?

11:25.559 --> 11:27.936
What you scared for?
I ain't gonna do nothing.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.986
What's up?

11:37.321 --> 11:41.282
Want some too, bitch?
Punk. What's wrong with you?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.243
You wanna die?

11:44.370 --> 11:46.538
Punk-ass white boy.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.297
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.342
He don't wanna see me and the heater.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.139
Lucky the bell rung.
I would have clocked that white boy.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.765
Punk-ass motherfucker.

12:05.933 --> 12:06.975
We'd smoke that fool.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.478
You gotta fucking stand up for yourself.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.204
We got a whole file on skinheads.

12:28.372 --> 12:31.332
These all part of the same gang?
Venice Beach Gang.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.918
Where's my buddy?
He's doing a stretch at YA.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.421
This guy C.C.?
Mm-hm.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.174
That him?
Yeah, that's him right there.

12:41.177 --> 12:44.345
This morning we have a guest coming in,
and there he is.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.556
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.349
- Good to see you, pal.
- Morning.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.643
Gentlemen, this here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

12:50.811 --> 12:53.188
He's principal over at Venice Beach High.

12:53.355 --> 12:58.109
He's been doing outreach work with gangs,
both in and out of the can.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.779
Three years ago,
a local kid named Derek Vinyard...

13:00.946 --> 13:04.449
...was sent up for murdering two Crips
who were trying to jack his car.

13:05.451 --> 13:09.037
Bob taught Vinyard back in high school
and he's followed the case closely.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.831
He was a skinhead, right?

13:11.999 --> 13:16.169
He was more like the skinhead.
The protégé of Cameron Alexander.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.047
- Who?
- Cameron Alexander.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.382
Here you go. Have a look-see.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.718
Cameron Alexander, well...

13:23.886 --> 13:25.470
...he's a Venice Beach landmark.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.224
He's probably the biggest distributor
of white-power literature and videos...

13:29.391 --> 13:30.475
...in L.A. County.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.144
He promotes white-power bands.
He writes reviews.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.231
And, uh, in his spare time
this guy even writes hate columns.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.690
Does he have a record?

13:37.858 --> 13:39.067
He's pretty clean.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.861
Been trying to pin something to him,
but it doesn't work.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.739
Trust me. He's behind all of it.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.200
He runs everything out of his house
down by the beach.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.410
No white gangs in Venice Beach...

13:49.578 --> 13:51.913
...before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.083
Alexander found in Derek
his shining prince.

13:55.251 --> 13:59.254
Essentially, he used Derek
to recruit a slew of insecure...

13:59.421 --> 14:01.422
...frustrated and impressionable kids.

14:01.590 --> 14:05.260
This kid Vinyard, well,
he's got a lot of baggage...

14:05.427 --> 14:09.389
...as you'll see in this tape
that we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.023
L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard...

14:19.191 --> 14:22.694
...was shot and killed battling a blaze
at a suspected Compton drug den.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.612
We're at the Vinyard home right now...

14:24.780 --> 14:28.783
...and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son,
Derek, has agreed to talk with us.

14:28.951 --> 14:32.745
Derek, if you could come down here,
please, for just a second.

14:32.913 --> 14:36.791
Look, I know this is tough,
but, um, how do you feel right now?

14:37.626 --> 14:39.460
How do you think I feel?

14:40.379 --> 14:43.840
- I think it's typical.
- Typical, how?

14:44.008 --> 14:47.719
This country's becoming a haven
for criminals, so, what do you expect?

14:47.887 --> 14:50.138
Decent, hardworking Americans
like my dad...

14:50.306 --> 14:53.391
...are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.226
Parasites?

14:55.769 --> 14:58.897
Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.189
I don't understand.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.483
You're saying your father's murder
was race-related?

15:02.651 --> 15:04.485
Yeah, it's race-related.

15:04.653 --> 15:08.281
Every problem in this country
is race-related, not just crime.

15:08.449 --> 15:12.201
Immigration, AIDS, welfare. Those are
problems of the black community...

15:12.369 --> 15:15.330
...the Hispanic community,
Asian community. Not white problems.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.498
Aren't those issues
that deal more with poverty?

15:17.666 --> 15:21.586
No. They're not products of their
environments, either. That's crap.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.963
Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.549
They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.969
Millions of white European-Americans
came here and flourished.

15:30.137 --> 15:33.181
Within a generation. What the fuck
is the matter with these people?

15:33.349 --> 15:35.934
They have to go around shooting at firemen.

15:36.852 --> 15:41.230
- What does this have to do with your father?
- My father was murdered doing his job.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.524
Putting out a fire
in a nigger neighborhood...

15:43.692 --> 15:45.526
...he shouldn't have given
a shit about.

15:45.694 --> 15:49.364
He got shot by a fucking drug dealer
who probably collects a welfare check.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.324
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.369
Derek Vinyard was released
from Chino earlier this morning...

15:54.536 --> 15:56.746
...after serving three and some-odd years.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.457
I think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.417
If something happens to him...

16:01.585 --> 16:04.045
...things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

16:04.421 --> 16:05.463
Just keep it low.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.884
Venice Beach didn't always look like this.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.470
It used to be a great neighborhood.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.472
The boardwalk's always been a dump...

16:14.640 --> 16:16.516
...but when my dad moved us out here...

16:16.684 --> 16:19.185
...Venice was a nice, quiet place
to grow up.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.815
Over the years, though,
it's just gone to hell.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.067
The gangs are like a plague.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.945
They moved west from Inglewood
and South Central...

16:29.113 --> 16:30.530
...and basically took over.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.991
It ain't fouling you.
What's wrong with you?

16:36.245 --> 16:37.495
Fuck all y'all.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.582
I ain't got time for all the bullshit.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.584
Fuck y'all.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.045
You all right?
I'm all right.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.299
Yo, is that that fool
you was telling me about?

16:51.218 --> 16:52.927
Yeah, that's that motherfucker.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.560
Yeah, man, that's him.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.445
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.781
That's why Derek started the D.O.C.

17:14.491 --> 17:18.286
He said white kids shouldn't have to walk
around scared in their own neighborhood.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.373
For a while there, he really made it
like it was ours again.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.959
- Throw the ball. Throw the ball.
- Come on, Seth. Block.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.963
Come on, Curtis. Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.466
- Pass that thing.
- D up.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.634
- Here we go.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

17:33.802 --> 17:34.844
Come on.

17:35.012 --> 17:39.140
Look at this fucking jungle bunny.
He does a spin move every time. Every time.

17:40.476 --> 17:44.103
- You ain't getting shit, motherfucker.
- Over here. Over here.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.646
This one's for you, boy!

17:46.482 --> 17:48.816
- Fuck you...?
- Stop that.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.443
Who you calling a boy, motherfucker?

17:50.611 --> 17:53.905
You lucky motherfucker! I'm through
monkeying around with your ass!

17:54.073 --> 17:56.532
You pale, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker...

17:56.700 --> 17:58.659
...a hundred bucks say
I make you my bitch.

18:01.663 --> 18:05.666
Hear that? He's trying to make ends meet
for his cut in welfare. You're fucking on!

18:07.628 --> 18:10.838
- It's 8-6, Seth.
- When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.508
Come on, guys, I can't cover this.
Help me out here.

18:13.675 --> 18:17.011
- You have a big fucking mouth, Seth.
- I can take this niglet down.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.597
You can't take a shit.
The fuck are you thinking?

18:19.765 --> 18:22.517
- I will beat him. Give me the money.
- Shut up. Shut up.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.936
You're gonna fucking embarrass us.
Shut up!

18:33.028 --> 18:34.445
I'll take care of this.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.615
Hey.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.035
I got a bet.

18:42.579 --> 18:46.791
I come in this game right now. Same score,
but we play black guys against white guys.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.044
Motherfucker.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.130
Oh, shit.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.173
Name your price, cracker.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.509
No money. No money. For these courts.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.469
And not just today. For good.

18:58.637 --> 19:02.849
If you win, we will walk away.
But if we win...

19:03.016 --> 19:05.143
...no bitching, no fighting...

19:05.310 --> 19:09.230
...here in front of everybody, pack your shit
and get your black asses out of here.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.315
Man, fuck that. Take this bet, man.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.859
Eight to six, our ball.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.987
Let's go.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.253
Pick him up. Pick him up.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.553
Seth, get back and play some D!

19:40.721 --> 19:42.513
Come on, Seth.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.434
Come on, let's go.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.403
All right. Defense!

20:04.411 --> 20:05.912
All right.

20:06.079 --> 20:08.289
Pass the fucking ball, I was wide open.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.502
Damn!

20:14.171 --> 20:15.880
Let's go. Let's go, yo. Let's go.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.715
Pick, pick, Derek!

20:23.805 --> 20:25.056
Bullshit! That's offense.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.434
- Get out of here. He moved his feet.
- If you want to go, I'm ready!

20:28.602 --> 20:30.061
- Don't throw elbows!
- Want to go?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.313
Adolf Hitler-wannabe motherfucker?
What?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.816
Kill that motherfucker! Dead!

20:35.984 --> 20:37.652
Chill out, bro. Chill out.

20:37.819 --> 20:41.155
- Wait, it's cool. It's cool.
- Relax.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.244
You okay?
- Yeah. Just give me some water.

20:46.411 --> 20:50.164
- You gotta call offense on that shit, Der.
- Not on game point, Danny.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.458
You can't let niggers
get away with that shit.

20:52.626 --> 20:56.420
- Honey, it's game point.
- Shut them down, Derek. Kick some ass.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.172
Watch this.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.705
Get that ball.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.124
Pass the ball, baby. Pass the ball.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.798
Yeah!

21:51.518 --> 21:52.560
Bye-bye.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.562
Get the fuck off my court.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.981
- This is my house.
- Fuck you, bitch.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.029
- What happened?
- I dropped the ball!

22:03.196 --> 22:04.238
Yeah!

22:09.411 --> 22:13.748
Get the fuck out of here!
This is my court! Yes!

22:19.880 --> 22:21.172
Yeah.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.885
Derek wouldn't let us visit him in prison.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.095
He said it would make it
too hard for him...

22:28.263 --> 22:31.432
...and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.852
Three years without him,
just wondering...

22:36.855 --> 22:39.774
...and then at 7:00 this morning...

22:39.941 --> 22:42.526
...we picked him up outside the gate.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.573
Come on, Danny.
Der.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.243
The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.

22:51.411 --> 22:55.956
I wanted to stay home, but he said,
"No, go to school. I'll see you later. "

23:09.262 --> 23:11.764
Oh, come on. Give the guy a break.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.141
What's the matter?
You too big to give me a hug?

23:14.309 --> 23:15.351
No, man.

23:15.519 --> 23:19.563
I just know you'll need someone to look
after you while you adjust to all this space.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.065
Yeah, right.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.819
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

23:24.986 --> 23:27.321
- How you doing? How's school?
- It's good. It's good.

23:27.489 --> 23:30.491
You gotta do something about that hair.
That 'do has gotta go.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.786
- I don't know. The girls like it, so...
- Well, I don't.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.205
You're keeping it pretty close.
All the way down, huh?

23:36.373 --> 23:37.915
Yeah.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.960
Shit, look, I forgot, man.

23:41.586 --> 23:45.172
- It hurt like shit while they put it on.
- When did you get that?

23:45.340 --> 23:47.716
I got it about a month ago.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.301
Cameron made it official.

23:49.469 --> 23:52.471
- Cameron?
- Yeah.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.684
- He put this on you?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.356
Hello?
- What?

24:02.524 --> 24:04.024
Hi. Just hang on a second.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.277
Derek, it's for you.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.821
Nothing. Nothing.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.406
- There a phone in the back?
- Mm-hm.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.241
I'll get it in the back.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.584
I got it.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.044
Yeah? Oh, hey.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.174
What?

24:30.427 --> 24:33.053
My eyes have seen the glory
Of the trampling at the zoo

24:33.221 --> 24:38.392
We washed ourselves in niggers' blood
And all the mongrels' too

24:38.560 --> 24:43.564
We're taking down the ZOG machine
Jew by Jew, by Jew

24:43.732 --> 24:47.234
The white man marches on

24:48.069 --> 24:50.488
You think our friend was behind that?

24:52.032 --> 24:53.574
You know what? I don't even care.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.534
I'm gonna take care of that tonight.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.036
Mwah.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.246
My sweet kid. My baby boy.

24:59.414 --> 25:02.416
God, what's with the love fest, you guys?

25:08.465 --> 25:11.091
No, he'll do it.
He'll do it. I'll make sure he does it.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.594
I'll get it.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.937
- Came to see the man.
- Can you fit through the door?

25:23.104 --> 25:24.605
Fuck you!

25:26.107 --> 25:28.192
- Seth.
What's up, Dan?

25:28.777 --> 25:30.319
How you doing? Where's Derek?

25:30.487 --> 25:31.529
He's on the phone.

25:31.696 --> 25:35.074
Come out, you free motherfucker!
Vinyard, where the fuck are you?

25:35.242 --> 25:36.909
- Vinyard!
- Hang on.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.119
- Give me a minute.
Vinyard!

25:39.287 --> 25:41.580
No, I'll be out in a minute.

25:56.596 --> 26:00.975
I'm being careful. What am I gonna do?
I won't stay in my room the rest of my life.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.227
Hold on.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.564
Hey. Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

26:06.982 --> 26:08.941
Did you invite him over?

26:09.109 --> 26:11.735
No, he always comes over here.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.655
All right. Danny, give me a minute.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.950
Just give me one minute.

26:27.460 --> 26:28.919
Yeah.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.596
God, are you still here, Goodyear?

26:40.265 --> 26:42.766
You calling me a blimp,
you fucking Democrat?

26:44.603 --> 26:47.354
When was the last time
you were able to see your feet?

26:50.650 --> 26:51.775
Come in here, Danny.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.362
Seth.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.616
Hey, man,
you going to Cam's party tonight?

26:58.783 --> 27:00.701
Is Davina's ass watertight?

27:00.869 --> 27:03.162
You're fucking sick, man.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.206
All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.

27:06.374 --> 27:09.293
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework to do.

27:09.461 --> 27:13.047
Tell me some of the shit you've learned,
fuck-ass, before I pistol-whip you.

27:13.214 --> 27:18.385
Okay. I believe in death, destruction,
chaos, filth and greed.

27:18.887 --> 27:22.222
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I wanna hear, asshole.

27:23.933 --> 27:28.228
- You mean that shit about your mother?
- You wanna get fucking beaten, Danny?

27:30.023 --> 27:33.233
I'm not fucking talking to you, Davina.
Why don't you shut up?

27:33.401 --> 27:36.445
Look, you got to let me do this
my own way, all right?

27:38.239 --> 27:39.406
I'll take care of it.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.617
Who do you hate, Danny?

27:41.785 --> 27:44.495
I hate anyone that isn't white Protestant.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.871
Why?

27:46.039 --> 27:48.540
They're a burden to the advancement
of the white race.

27:48.708 --> 27:53.045
- Some of them are all right, I guess.
- None of them are fucking all right, Danny.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.881
They're all fucking freeloaders.
Remember what Cam said?

27:56.049 --> 27:59.885
"We don't know them. We don't wanna
know them. They're the fucking enemy. "

28:01.680 --> 28:05.057
What don't you like about them?
And say it with some fucking conviction.

28:05.225 --> 28:08.352
I hate the fact that it's cool
to be black these days.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.021
Good.
I hate this hip-hop...

28:11.189 --> 28:13.607
...fucking influence
on white fucking suburbia.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.610
- Good.
And I hate Tabitha Soren...

28:16.778 --> 28:19.154
...and all her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...

28:19.322 --> 28:21.031
...telling us we should get along.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.909
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...

28:24.077 --> 28:25.953
...because it ain't gonna fucking happen.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.789
That's the best shit I've heard
come out of your mouth.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.625
Danny, no. I feel sorry for you, Danny.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.210
I know you don't believe that.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.713
- Shut up, Davina!
- No, you shut the fuck up!

28:35.880 --> 28:38.465
Get out of the house, you piece of shit!
Please go.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.426
Is that any way to talk to a guest?

28:40.593 --> 28:41.677
A friend of the family?

28:41.845 --> 28:45.597
- Derek hates you and you don't realize it.
- Hey, how do you know who I hate?

28:45.765 --> 28:47.766
Fucking A. Back from the dead.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.436
God bless Jesus Christ, man.

28:50.603 --> 28:54.231
I think you lost weight, man. I can get
my arms almost all the way around you.

28:54.399 --> 28:58.485
Fifty fucking pounds, man.
Jesus, look at this hair. Holy shit.

28:58.653 --> 29:01.655
- Yeah, I told him it's gotta go.
It's good to have you back.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.324
Grab your jacket,
let's get the fuck out of here.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.660
All right. I wanna talk to him one second.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.995
Look...

29:08.288 --> 29:10.414
Hey, uh, listen...

29:10.582 --> 29:12.666
...did you pull some shit
in school today?

29:12.834 --> 29:16.170
- No, just the usual.
- I'm telling you, man, this kid is awesome.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.840
- Did you turn in a paper on Mein Kampf?
- Yeah.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.216
Awesome.
- You should've...

29:21.384 --> 29:23.761
Sweeney probably shit his pants.
- He did, man.

29:23.928 --> 29:26.638
Did Cameron put you up to that?
Did he tell you to do that?

29:26.806 --> 29:29.975
No, man, I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know, though?

29:30.143 --> 29:31.852
- How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter how.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.188
This kid is smart as hell.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.273
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

29:37.108 --> 29:38.150
Yeah, Sweeney called.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.152
What are you talking to Sweeney for?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.613
Relax. Listen.
- He's got to get a fucking life.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.532
- He pisses me off.
- Sweeney's a good teacher, all right?

29:45.700 --> 29:48.327
Sweeney is a nigger on a power trip,
Vinyard.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.579
That's what he was like
when we were there.

29:50.747 --> 29:53.665
- And it'll never change. Fuck that nigger!
- Hey, Seth.

29:53.833 --> 29:56.376
- Seth, go away. Go away.
- What? Are you kidding?

29:56.544 --> 29:59.922
Go wait in Danny's room. I wanna
talk to my brother. I'm glad to see you.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.633
- I'll be there in one minute.
- Hurry up. I'm starving.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.806
Come here. Seriously, look...

30:08.973 --> 30:12.559
Forget this yahoo. He kills bugs for a living.
You don't wanna be like that.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.728
I'm serious. It's not funny.

30:14.896 --> 30:17.022
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn from him.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.399
So don't fuck it up
with small-fry shit like that.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.068
You got to be smarter than that.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.904
You gotta see the bullshit paper
he's making me write.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.532
I know about it. He told me about it.
I don't care.

30:26.699 --> 30:29.243
Do it. You do anything he tells
you to do. I mean it.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.287
I don't want you in trouble in school,
trying to impress me...

30:32.455 --> 30:34.706
...taking this shit in there, all right?

30:34.874 --> 30:36.542
Do you understand what I'm saying?

30:36.709 --> 30:39.086
I guess, but I was doing it
because I thought you'd be happy.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.381
Well, I'm not.

30:43.591 --> 30:46.218
Shit. Listen to that.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.762
Yeah, I know. It's been getting worse.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.599
All right, don't worry about it.
I'll talk to you about this later.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.434
Okay.
Later.

30:55.895 --> 30:59.481
She's coughing her lungs out and
you're blowing this shit in her face all day.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.149
- Put it out.
I'm putting it out.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.442
All right. Come on.

31:02.610 --> 31:05.696
Hey. Come on, I wanna talk to you.

31:09.576 --> 31:12.703
Mommy, are you okay?

31:17.959 --> 31:20.252
What are you doing? Put that out.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.463
I'm yelling at him for blowing smoke
and you're here sucking on it.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.424
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

31:25.592 --> 31:27.175
Yeah.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.763
You all right?

31:37.979 --> 31:39.396
Look...

31:39.564 --> 31:42.065
...you gotta take it easy.
You gotta get some rest.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.485
I want you to take Danny's and my room
and we'll hit the couch.

31:45.653 --> 31:49.197
- Couch is fine for now.
- No, it's not fine. It's not. This is terrible.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.325
We can't live like this.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.535
We gotta get out of here.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.247
Can I go with you?

31:57.999 --> 32:00.792
Yeah, we all gotta get out of here.
That's the point.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.336
I could drop out of school.

32:02.503 --> 32:06.340
No. No, absolutely not. You gotta finish.
I'll work something out.

32:10.136 --> 32:14.431
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.683
I don't give a shit!
Go wait in the living room!

32:16.851 --> 32:19.353
- God.
- I want him out of my house.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.064
I know, I know. Look.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.498
He's an idiot. He's always been an idiot.

32:39.666 --> 32:42.376
Whatever, dude. He can't help it.
I gotta do that paper.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.878
Look, I'm gonna catch up with you
later tonight.

32:45.046 --> 32:47.965
Not at Cameron's, all right?
I need you to stay away from there.

32:48.132 --> 32:51.510
- Why? I thought we were gonna hang.
- Trust me. I'll explain it later.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.638
I need you to stay away from the party,
all right?

32:54.806 --> 32:56.306
- Whatever.
- Hey, I'm not kidding.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.558
Promise me you'll stay
away from that party.

32:58.726 --> 33:01.144
I'm not fucking 14 anymore, all right?

33:02.271 --> 33:03.647
Whatever.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.109
God!

33:12.865 --> 33:14.408
Come on, let's go.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.745
- Where are you parked?
- Out back.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.775
- Yeah, that's the whole bunch.
- Right.

34:30.943 --> 34:33.570
It didn't take long for Derek
to make a name for himself.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.864
And Cameron knew just how to use it.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.991
You sure you don't wanna
stick around?

34:38.159 --> 34:40.327
You know I'd love to...

34:40.495 --> 34:41.995
...but I gotta be careful.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.330
Yeah, I know.

34:44.415 --> 34:47.000
- We'll see you back at the house, then.
- Right.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.668
- All right.
- Good luck.

34:48.835 --> 34:50.920
He sent Derek to the kids...

34:51.089 --> 34:52.672
...to the frustrated ones.

34:52.840 --> 34:57.010
The ones who were sick of getting their
asses kicked by black and Mexican gangs.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.512
Don't just be some punk...

34:58.679 --> 34:59.930
...be part of something.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.599
All right, let's go. Pull it together.

35:02.767 --> 35:07.395
And everybody ate it up.
They did whatever Derek told them to.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.315
Let's go. Come on,
we're not here to fucking socialize.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.611
Shut the fuck up.
Check this shit out, man.

35:14.779 --> 35:18.698
You want a little toke? Huh? Go ahead.

35:18.866 --> 35:21.326
- Curtis, what is that?
- Aw, come on, Derek.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.703
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

35:23.871 --> 35:26.873
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ.
- Have a little self-respect.

35:28.876 --> 35:32.420
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

35:33.840 --> 35:39.052
There's over 2 million illegal immigrants
bedding down in this state tonight.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.765
This state spent $3 billion last year...

35:43.933 --> 35:47.310
...on services for people who had
no right to be here in the first place.

35:47.478 --> 35:48.895
Three billion dollars.

35:49.063 --> 35:54.109
Four hundred million dollars just to lock up
a bunch of illegal immigrant criminals...

35:54.277 --> 35:57.154
...who only got into this country
because the INS decided...

35:57.321 --> 36:01.032
...it's not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.663
Who gives a shit?
Our government doesn't give a shit.

36:08.082 --> 36:09.916
Our border policy is a joke.

36:10.459 --> 36:14.171
So is anybody surprised that south
of the border they're laughing at us?

36:14.338 --> 36:16.089
- Laughing at our laws.
- Yeah.

36:16.257 --> 36:19.092
Every night these parasites
stream across the border...

36:19.260 --> 36:20.844
...like some fucking pinata exploded.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.179
Ha-ha-ha.
- Don't laugh!

36:23.264 --> 36:26.683
There's nothing funny going on here.
This is about your life and mine.

36:27.810 --> 36:31.146
It's about decent, hardworking Americans
falling through the cracks...

36:31.314 --> 36:33.857
...and getting the shaft.
The government cares about...

36:34.025 --> 36:38.528
...the constitutional rights of a bunch of
people who aren't citizens of this country!

36:38.696 --> 36:42.657
On the Statue of Liberty, it says, "Give me
your tired, your hungry, your poor. "

36:42.825 --> 36:45.410
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

36:45.578 --> 36:49.122
And I say until you take care of that,
close the fucking book!

36:49.290 --> 36:51.208
Because we're losing.

36:51.834 --> 36:55.128
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.963
We're losing our freedom...

36:57.131 --> 37:00.967
...so that a bunch of fucking foreigners
can come in and exploit our country.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.970
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

37:04.138 --> 37:07.015
This isn't happening in places
we can't do anything about it.

37:07.183 --> 37:11.645
It's happening right here! Right in our
neighborhood. Right in that building.

37:11.812 --> 37:15.148
Archie Miller ran that grocery store
since we were kids here.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.109
Dave worked there, Mike worked there.

37:18.277 --> 37:21.905
He went under, and now some fucking
Korean owns it, who fired these guys...

37:22.073 --> 37:26.368
...and is making a killing because
he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.

37:26.535 --> 37:29.913
I see this shit going on and I don't see
anybody doing anything about it.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.915
And it fucking pisses me off!

37:34.126 --> 37:36.002
So look around you.

37:37.046 --> 37:39.256
This isn't our neighborhood.
It's a battlefield.

37:39.423 --> 37:42.384
We're on a battlefield tonight.
Make a decision.

37:42.551 --> 37:45.512
Are we gonna stand on the sidelines...

37:45.680 --> 37:48.473
...quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

37:48.641 --> 37:50.058
Fuck that.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.018
Are we gonna ante up
and do something?

37:52.186 --> 37:53.687
Fuck, yeah!
Hell, yeah!

37:53.854 --> 37:55.105
You're goddamn right we are.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.077
Come here!

38:09.245 --> 38:13.039
Don't you know it's against the law
to hire border-jumpers, you nip bastard?

38:15.042 --> 38:17.002
Fuck that! Fuck that!

38:20.965 --> 38:24.092
Sweetheart. No, you don't need this.
We're not gonna hurt you.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.845
Please! Please, no!

38:28.723 --> 38:30.140
You fucking spic!

38:33.686 --> 38:35.854
You know what?
I think this bitch is hungry.

38:36.022 --> 38:38.064
This bitch stinks.
Get me cleaning products.

38:38.232 --> 38:40.150
Smells like fish and chips
and guacamole.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.609
Here we go.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.653
Yeah, that's it.

38:58.544 --> 39:00.086
Get the fuck up!

39:04.258 --> 39:05.967
Get down!

39:13.684 --> 39:15.685
Have some fucking beans,
you goddamn beaner.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.020
Yeah!

39:17.605 --> 39:19.689
- Take my job.
- You donkey bitch!

39:24.195 --> 39:25.445
Get some of that in there.

39:25.613 --> 39:28.740
- Throw it on, throw it on.
Hey, that's a great color on you.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.700
You can get a white woman's job,
bitch.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.578
A little better than this one, huh?
Yeah.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.790
- White.
You can move up in the world, huh?

39:38.084 --> 39:39.876
Asshole!

39:41.379 --> 39:45.757
Let's go. We're out of here.
Everybody out. Let's go. Now. Now!

39:48.386 --> 39:50.303
All right, let's go! Let's go!

39:51.263 --> 39:53.723
Let's go.
- Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.642
Let's go.

39:58.771 --> 40:01.940
No green card, no fucking work,
comprendes?

40:04.402 --> 40:05.985
- Come on. Come on!
Go, go, go.

40:06.153 --> 40:07.487
We're fucking done! Come on!

40:33.848 --> 40:37.684
Dad was gone.
But things were almost normal again.

40:37.852 --> 40:41.354
Derek had a good job.
Mom was starting to live a little.

40:41.522 --> 40:45.692
Everyone was feeling so good
that we just didn't see it coming.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.485
Maybe we should have.

40:47.736 --> 40:51.197
The irony is that most of the stores
that were destroyed during the riots...

40:51.365 --> 40:53.950
...were owned by black people.
- That's stupid, though.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.577
Why trash your own neighborhood?

40:55.744 --> 40:58.538
Well, that's my point.
It's an irrational act.

40:58.706 --> 41:03.001
It's like an expression of rage
by people who feel neglected...

41:03.169 --> 41:04.711
...and turned away by the system.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.672
Exactly.
I mean, it's like we had in Watts...

41:07.840 --> 41:10.258
...or the riots in Chicago in '68...

41:10.426 --> 41:11.885
I don't buy that for a minute.

41:12.052 --> 41:15.722
Calling a riot an irrational expression
of rage, that's such a cop-out.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.349
It's opportunism at its worst.
A bunch of people...

41:18.517 --> 41:21.644
...grabbing any excuse they can find
to go and loot a store.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.813
The fact these people ripped off stores...

41:23.981 --> 41:26.649
...in their own communities
reflects that these people...

41:26.817 --> 41:28.610
...have no respect for the law.

41:28.777 --> 41:33.156
And certainly no concept of community
or civic responsibility.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.910
Wait a minute. White people commit
crimes against white people too.

41:37.077 --> 41:40.413
But they're not offing each other
in record numbers all over America.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.415
Look at the statistics, for chrissakes.

41:42.583 --> 41:47.003
One in every three black males is in
some phase of the correctional system.

41:47.171 --> 41:51.174
Is that a coincidence or do these people
have a racial commitment to crime?

41:51.884 --> 41:53.510
Not only that. They're proud of it.

41:53.677 --> 41:56.721
Maybe it says something about prejudice
in the judicial system.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.765
If you wanna talk about
criminal statistics...

41:58.933 --> 42:02.602
...you might wanna take a look at
the social inequalities that produce them.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.771
Yap, yap. You know what?
That's exactly what I hate.

42:04.939 --> 42:07.690
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

42:07.858 --> 42:11.945
...and alleviating the responsibility that
these people have for their own actions.

42:12.571 --> 42:13.613
It's like saying:

42:13.781 --> 42:17.075
"It's not a riot, it's rage.
It's not crime, it's poverty. "

42:17.243 --> 42:21.371
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit.
It's exactly what happened in this trial too.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.958
Because the media twisted things around
so people focused on these cops...

42:25.125 --> 42:26.668
...whether they'd get convicted...

42:26.835 --> 42:29.963
...and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

42:30.130 --> 42:32.257
Everybody lost sight
of Rodney King himself.

42:32.424 --> 42:35.385
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

42:35.553 --> 42:39.639
He's high as a goddamn kite, driving
120 miles an hour down the highway.

42:39.807 --> 42:43.560
He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops,
and he attacks them.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.312
He attacked police officers.
Bottom line. And he walked.

42:46.480 --> 42:50.316
And there's some yahoo with a video
camera who turned it on halfway through...

42:50.484 --> 42:52.360
...so all we see is them hitting him.

42:52.528 --> 42:56.573
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up
and cracking him with billy clubs...

42:56.740 --> 42:59.284
...and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull.

42:59.451 --> 43:01.786
And people are going,
"Oh, this poor guy. "

43:01.954 --> 43:03.162
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

43:03.330 --> 43:06.249
And those cops end up on the stand
defending themselves...

43:06.417 --> 43:09.794
...for using absolutely standard,
textbook self-defense procedures.

43:09.962 --> 43:11.921
I don't think the tape showed that at all.

43:12.089 --> 43:15.008
You didn't think so?
And what, you're an authority, Ma?

43:16.051 --> 43:17.343
Murray, what do you think?

43:18.971 --> 43:22.932
I did think that the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

43:23.100 --> 43:26.436
Who are you to say what's excessive?
I think it was totally appropriate.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.522
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

43:29.690 --> 43:33.860
In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain
amount of authority to make those calls...

43:34.028 --> 43:37.780
...because we acknowledge that their job
is difficult and dangerous.

43:37.948 --> 43:41.701
You know? Unfortunately,
very few people, like, respect that authority.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.704
Look who's talking about respect here,
Mr. Junior-KKK.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.831
- What?
- Davina.

43:46.999 --> 43:49.876
You wanna go to college, Davina?
You should learn to listen.

43:50.044 --> 43:53.046
I didn't say I respected laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

43:53.213 --> 43:56.549
I don't respect laws that let monkeys
like Rodney King on the street.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.509
Second, I am not, as you well know...

43:58.677 --> 44:03.389
...a member of a low-rent, disorganized
bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.892
Please. So take your head
out of your ass.

44:06.810 --> 44:08.603
You've gotten off the point.

44:09.897 --> 44:13.399
- I had a point. That wasn't the point.
- Do you have one? What is your point?

44:13.567 --> 44:15.401
All right, think about this.

44:15.569 --> 44:17.737
If Danny had been
walking across the street...

44:17.905 --> 44:22.283
...and Rodney King had plowed into him...
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

44:22.576 --> 44:23.910
Mm-hm.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.710
Who would like some dessert?

44:34.296 --> 44:35.588
We're having a discussion.

44:35.756 --> 44:38.007
We're having a nice discussion, right?

44:38.175 --> 44:40.843
If Rodney King had been hopped up
on Chivas Regal and PCP...

44:41.011 --> 44:43.096
...and killed Danny,
you'd sing a different tune.

44:43.263 --> 44:45.807
I didn't see him hit anybody
and neither did you.

44:45.974 --> 44:47.725
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

44:47.893 --> 44:50.978
- Thank God.
- Keep it down, okay? Ally's sleeping.

44:53.941 --> 44:57.777
If he had, though? Come on, think about it.
If that monkey had run some kid over...

44:57.945 --> 45:00.863
...everybody would have a different
opinion of this matter.

45:01.031 --> 45:03.741
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

45:03.909 --> 45:06.202
But instead, he just attacked a few cops.

45:06.370 --> 45:10.248
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across
America for this total son of a bitch.

45:10.416 --> 45:11.624
I mean, it blows my mind.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.793
We're hung up on this notion
we have some...

45:13.961 --> 45:16.546
...obligation to help
the struggling black man.

45:16.714 --> 45:20.299
Cut him some slack until he can overcome
these historical injustices.

45:20.467 --> 45:22.885
It's crap. This stuff you guys
are saying perpetuates it.

45:23.053 --> 45:24.429
All this liberal nonsense.

45:24.596 --> 45:27.974
Everyone's looking the other way
while our country rots from inside out.

45:28.142 --> 45:31.811
Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves,
what, like, 130 years ago?

45:31.979 --> 45:34.564
How long does it take
to get your act together?

45:34.732 --> 45:37.650
Well, Jews have been persecuted
for over 5000 years.

45:37.818 --> 45:41.571
Are you saying that it's wrong
to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

45:42.030 --> 45:45.992
Forget that. I'm with you.
I am with you all the way, baby.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.996
- I'm sick of these liberal hypocrites.
- Here we go again. I love this part.

45:50.164 --> 45:53.082
Well, look at the way that they
scapegoated Chief Gates.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.752
They'd come down that hard
on black Willie Williams?

45:55.919 --> 45:59.297
- No way. The video was a setup.
- Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused?

45:59.673 --> 46:01.841
- Yes.
- No, you cannot. Don't interrupt.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.844
Excuse me, I was talking.
I listened to you.

46:05.012 --> 46:06.512
The hell do you think you are?

46:06.680 --> 46:09.599
- She's in the middle of a point.
- Who do you think you are?

46:09.767 --> 46:10.892
- Sit down!
- No. Fuck you!

46:11.059 --> 46:13.311
Sit down! Shut up!
Derek, calm down.

46:13.479 --> 46:14.812
- Sit down!
- Derek, calm down.

46:14.980 --> 46:17.356
- Shut up!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

46:17.524 --> 46:19.358
- Sit your ass down! No.
- Fuck you, move!

46:19.526 --> 46:21.778
- Sit down, shut up!
- Get out of my way! Move!

46:21.945 --> 46:23.154
Goddamn it, Derek, move!

46:23.322 --> 46:25.448
Shut your mouth
and give my girlfriend respect.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.867
Derek, what are you trying to prove?

46:28.035 --> 46:31.704
Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey.
Where do you think you're going?

46:31.872 --> 46:35.750
- Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go!
Come here!

46:35.918 --> 46:38.169
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina.

46:38.337 --> 46:41.214
- Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
- Derek!

46:41.381 --> 46:42.882
Stop!

46:43.050 --> 46:45.092
She can't breathe!

46:45.636 --> 46:47.345
Let her go!

46:47.513 --> 46:49.263
Are you gonna apologize?

46:49.431 --> 46:51.599
Are you gonna apologize? Are you?

46:51.767 --> 46:53.017
You're a fucking asshole.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.728
I hate you!

47:04.446 --> 47:06.572
What are you doing, Derek?
This is your family.

47:06.740 --> 47:10.243
Right, my family. So you know what?
I don't give two shits about you...

47:10.410 --> 47:13.830
...anybody else or what you think.
You're not part of it, never will be.

47:13.997 --> 47:16.249
- That has nothing to do with it!
It doesn't?

47:16.416 --> 47:18.000
You don't think I see
what you're doing?

47:18.168 --> 47:21.754
You think I'll sit here and smile while
some kike tries to fuck my mother?

47:22.506 --> 47:23.798
It's never gonna happen!

47:23.966 --> 47:26.968
Fucking forget it. Not on my watch.
Not while I'm in this family.

47:27.135 --> 47:30.263
I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off
and stick it up your ass...

47:30.430 --> 47:32.765
...before I let that happen.
Coming in here...

47:32.933 --> 47:37.770
...and poisoning my family's dinner with
your Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!

47:41.900 --> 47:44.277
Fuck you!

47:44.444 --> 47:46.237
Yeah, walk out.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.531
Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading
motherfucker!

47:48.699 --> 47:50.241
Get the fuck out of my house!

47:55.414 --> 47:57.415
You see this?
That means "not welcome. "

48:10.262 --> 48:11.721
- What did I do?
- You disgust me!

48:11.889 --> 48:14.056
You disgust me! Bring him to our table!

48:14.224 --> 48:15.975
Primping your hair and your dress!

48:16.977 --> 48:20.229
- Don't touch me! All tarted up!
- What did I do to you?

48:20.397 --> 48:23.858
How could you bring him to Dad's table?
How could you go from Dad to that?

48:24.026 --> 48:25.151
Aren't you ashamed?

48:25.319 --> 48:28.613
I'm ashamed that you came out of my body!

48:32.159 --> 48:35.828
Go run to your fucking kike!
Go run to him!

48:41.043 --> 48:44.003
It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby.

48:50.844 --> 48:52.511
I'm so sorry, Doris.

48:53.013 --> 48:54.847
I really am.

49:02.648 --> 49:06.192
- He's gone.
- He's just a boy...

49:06.360 --> 49:08.444
...without a father.

49:09.196 --> 49:12.281
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

49:22.542 --> 49:24.001
Goodbye.

50:09.214 --> 50:10.881
Hey. You all right?

50:13.719 --> 50:16.512
- Take this, you fucking dick!
- Hey, no. No, no, come here!

50:16.680 --> 50:17.847
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!

50:18.015 --> 50:19.223
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

50:19.391 --> 50:20.766
Let me go, goddamn it!

50:20.934 --> 50:22.935
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

50:24.688 --> 50:26.814
I would never hurt you. You know that.

50:26.982 --> 50:29.025
Come on, I screwed up. I lost control.

50:29.192 --> 50:30.609
It's not you.

50:30.777 --> 50:32.111
I'm sorry.

50:32.279 --> 50:34.447
Come on, I'd never hurt you guys.
I'd never hurt you.

50:34.614 --> 50:36.574
You know that. I'd do anything for you.

50:36.742 --> 50:37.950
I don't believe you.

50:38.910 --> 50:40.202
I trust you, Derek.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.255
Hi.

50:51.423 --> 50:53.883
Hi. What are you doing out of bed, huh?

50:54.051 --> 50:55.968
- Want a plane ride?
- Yeah.

50:56.136 --> 50:57.970
Going for takeoff.

50:59.514 --> 51:02.349
- Woo-hoo!
- Heh-heh-heh.

51:02.517 --> 51:03.601
Oh, no.

51:03.769 --> 51:05.603
No, no! Don't crash!

51:06.480 --> 51:08.314
Gotta go to Mom.

51:08.482 --> 51:10.316
She's a crazy flier.

51:10.484 --> 51:14.153
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

51:14.946 --> 51:16.489
Okay.

51:22.204 --> 51:25.956
- You don't feel too hot.
- No, it's in my chest.

51:26.124 --> 51:28.459
- What are you up to?
- I'm just thinking.

51:29.044 --> 51:30.336
A lot of that going around.

51:30.504 --> 51:33.297
- I don't even know how we got here.
- Mom.

51:33.465 --> 51:36.092
Like I let you all down.
I don't know when it happened.

51:36.259 --> 51:38.135
Mom, it's okay.

51:38.303 --> 51:39.970
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.766
It's cold in here. No wonder you're sick.

51:43.934 --> 51:46.227
Don't get sick from cold,
you get sick from germs.

51:46.394 --> 51:49.688
No, you get sick from smoking.

51:50.732 --> 51:53.651
You gotta quit. It's not good for you.

51:59.533 --> 52:01.700
What are you looking at me like that for?

52:01.868 --> 52:04.495
When are you gonna let that
beautiful hair grow back?

52:06.206 --> 52:08.332
The day you quit smoking.

52:11.294 --> 52:12.545
Deal.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.631
I better get Ally to bed.

52:15.799 --> 52:17.216
- Say good night to Mom?
- Mm-hm.

52:17.384 --> 52:19.677
Then you have to go to bed. Come on.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.513
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

52:23.557 --> 52:24.723
Good night, Mom.

52:56.923 --> 53:00.384
I go back to that night
again and again in my mind.

53:00.552 --> 53:02.428
I try to stop it from happening.

53:02.596 --> 53:04.597
I want you out of this house.

53:05.390 --> 53:07.683
That's fine. I'll be gone in the morning.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.268
He can move in with me.

53:10.604 --> 53:12.897
In my mind,
I imagine what would've happened...

53:13.064 --> 53:16.233
...if I hadn't gone into that room
and told him.

53:17.777 --> 53:18.861
Danny, get down!

53:20.363 --> 53:23.115
No, Danny!

53:24.409 --> 53:25.618
Mommy!

53:39.382 --> 53:41.592
Nigger, you just fucked with
the wrong bull.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.802
- Come here!
- Get off!

53:43.970 --> 53:47.431
You should've learned your place
on the fucking basketball court!

53:47.599 --> 53:50.601
But you fucking monkeys
never get the message!

53:50.769 --> 53:53.145
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

53:53.313 --> 53:54.730
You ever shoot at firemen?

53:54.898 --> 53:56.774
You come here, you shoot at my family?

53:56.942 --> 53:59.318
I'm gonna teach you a real lesson,
motherfucker.

53:59.486 --> 54:01.487
Put your fucking mouth on the curb.

54:01.655 --> 54:02.655
Come on, man!

54:02.822 --> 54:05.282
Put it on the curb! Right now!

54:09.162 --> 54:11.789
- That's it.
- Derek, no!

54:13.667 --> 54:16.293
No!

54:16.461 --> 54:17.836
Now say good night.

54:30.517 --> 54:32.142
Fucker.

54:37.857 --> 54:41.235
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!

54:41.403 --> 54:43.028
Put your hands up!

54:43.196 --> 54:45.197
I said, get your hands up!

54:45.365 --> 54:46.865
Now turn around!

54:55.959 --> 54:58.961
Put your hands behind your head!

55:02.382 --> 55:04.300
Get down on your knees right now!

56:01.775 --> 56:04.068
It's all right.

56:04.235 --> 56:05.944
It's all right.

56:07.822 --> 56:09.281
Let's go.

56:10.575 --> 56:12.201
Come on.

56:21.294 --> 56:22.669
She ain't gonna open the door?

56:22.837 --> 56:25.422
I don't know.
Someone's there looking at us. Hello?

56:25.590 --> 56:27.049
Danny, it's for you.

56:28.593 --> 56:30.135
I'll be right there.

56:42.774 --> 56:46.068
Open the door, Danny!
It's fucking freezing!

56:46.694 --> 56:48.153
Danny, this party's gonna be sick!

56:49.072 --> 56:51.156
Come on, Danny!

57:21.855 --> 57:24.022
I'm gonna go get some beers.

57:36.244 --> 57:38.370
Hey, what a party, huh, fat Seth?

57:38.538 --> 57:41.457
I'm not fat, asshole! I'm husky.

57:42.375 --> 57:44.293
What the fuck's up, Seth?

57:44.461 --> 57:46.545
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

57:46.713 --> 57:47.921
Holy fuck. He's here?

57:48.089 --> 57:49.798
- Yeah, he's here.
- He's fucking here.

57:49.966 --> 57:52.176
- Go pay your respects.
- Fuck you, Seth.

57:54.471 --> 57:56.889
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

57:57.640 --> 58:00.601
- Father Vinyard?
- How's it going? I'm Jason, this is Chris.

58:00.768 --> 58:03.770
- We're friends with your brother.
- You are a fucking god, man!

58:03.938 --> 58:06.231
- Oh, shit, yeah.
Derek!

58:10.904 --> 58:12.321
Hey.

58:23.374 --> 58:25.501
- I thought you turned that paper in.
- I did...

58:25.668 --> 58:27.586
...and now fucking Murray
turned me in...

58:27.754 --> 58:30.964
...and so Sweeney's
making me write another one.

58:32.425 --> 58:35.719
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying, now, does he?

58:36.679 --> 58:39.640
He's one of those proud-to-be-nigger
people. I hate those guys.

58:39.807 --> 58:41.517
Now, wait a minute, Danny.

58:41.684 --> 58:43.393
He's not proud.

58:45.396 --> 58:49.233
He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

58:49.400 --> 58:53.570
He's trying to make you feel guilty
about writing about Adolf Hitler. Yeah.

58:53.738 --> 58:57.407
Some nigger, some spic writes about
Martin Luther King...

58:57.575 --> 58:59.576
...or fucking Cesar "Commie" Chavez...

58:59.744 --> 59:01.537
- Heh-heh-heh.
... gets a pat on the head.

59:01.996 --> 59:03.455
Yeah.

59:04.123 --> 59:07.042
I mean, you can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

59:08.294 --> 59:09.878
Definitely.

59:12.966 --> 59:14.925
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

59:15.093 --> 59:16.134
No, listen to me.

59:18.137 --> 59:22.808
I wanna see you, okay? I do.
But I gotta take care of something tonight.

59:24.894 --> 59:27.312
- Okay.
- You understand?

59:27.480 --> 59:30.983
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

59:34.445 --> 59:37.155
- Look, would you do something with me?
- Anything.

59:38.491 --> 59:40.158
Leave with me.

59:40.994 --> 59:43.328
- Leave where?
- Leave here. Leave all this.

59:44.122 --> 59:45.622
Just come with me.

59:45.790 --> 59:49.334
Why would you wanna leave? They
worship you. You're like a god to them.

59:49.502 --> 59:51.253
If you think we had it good before...

59:51.421 --> 59:54.214
...wait till you see what it's like now.
- I don't want all that.

59:54.382 --> 59:58.010
I don't want my family involved.
Everything I've done here has fucked it up.

59:58.177 --> 01:00:01.179
- Do you understand?
- You think what you did was wrong?

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.099
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:06.643
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:08.770
...and we all know that.

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:10.439
I understand you just got out...

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.191
...but no one's gonna hurt you.
No one can touch you.

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:14.818
There's a small army out there.

01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:17.321
We won't let a bunch of spooks
kick us out of here.

01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:20.616
Stacey, you're not listening to me, okay?
I'm not scared.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:21.950
I don't want it anymore.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.454
I'm done with it. I'm through with this.

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:27.372
It's...

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.791
It's bullshit, Stacey.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.420
Listen, you don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:36.673
If you wanna be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.884
Come on.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:40.093
You're nuts.

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:42.220
You are nuts. No way.

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:45.349
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:49.186
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.563
I mean, it is like nothing
you have ever seen!

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.065
This is a mistake. Forget it.

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:56.068
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:58.320
Stacey, just say goodbye.
Just say goodbye.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.530
This isn't you.

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:03.241
- I know you.
- You don't know anything about me, Stacey.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.043
- Hey. Are you Danny's brother?
- Yeah.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:14.836
Tell him Lizzy's looking for him.

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:17.214
Lizzy. Thank you.

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:23.929
We'll let the niggers, kikes and spics
grab for their piece of the pie.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:25.389
Can't blame them.

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:29.893
Of course,
they're gonna have to fight to get it.

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:33.855
And if we scare the fuck out of people...

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:37.567
...and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.238
You gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:45.283
- Ha, ha. Hey, man.
- Well, look who's here.

01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:47.369
The return of the soldier.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:52.541
- What are you doing here, Danny?
- Come on, man. I had to check it out.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.752
- You knew I was gonna come.
Let the kid alone, Derek.

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.796
He knows when to go to bed.

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:03.009
- Go wait outside.
- Come on, I'm not doing anything.

01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:05.137
There's a little blond sitting out there.

01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:08.473
She keeps asking for you.
She's dying. Come on.

01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:10.851
- Well, I gotta check out.
- Go easy on her.

01:02:11.018 --> 01:02:12.978
All right.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:18.942
Wait for me right outside.

01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:25.157
Take it easy.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:27.284
Chill out.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:30.078
You're on safe ground.

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:33.498
You don't have to watch your ass
around here.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:37.294
Come on, sit down. Relax.

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.173
I'm sorry. The party was a little quick.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.885
But we're just so damned glad
you're back, Derek.

01:02:45.052 --> 01:02:48.430
- It's only natural you should feel funny.
- I don't feel funny, Cam.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:53.185
You know, you made the fat kid nervous.
He thinks the joint messed with your mind.

01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:54.686
It did.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:05.489
Glory, glory hallelujah

01:03:06.365 --> 01:03:10.660
Glory, glory hallelujah

01:03:10.828 --> 01:03:14.039
The white man marches on

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:17.209
Things have changed
since you've been gone, Derek.

01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:19.377
You talk about organization?

01:03:19.545 --> 01:03:22.214
Wait till you see
what we've done with the Internet.

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:26.051
We've got every gang from Seattle
to San Diego working together now.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.470
They're not competing.
They're consolidated.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.014
Only thing we lack
is a little overall leadership.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.934
And that's where you come in.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:37.312
Because people out there
got a lot of respect for you, Derek.

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:41.733
- When you're ready, talk to me about it.
- Well, you can forget about that.

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.069
I'm done with it, Cam.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:47.072
Yeah, well, I know you grew out of that...

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.575
...shaved-head bullshit
a long time ago, thank God.

01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:52.410
I like your hair the way it is now.

01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:54.996
See, that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:57.916
- No more of this grocery store...
- You're not listening.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:01.461
I am done with it. All that bullshit
out there and all your bullshit too.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.129
I'm out.

01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:06.341
I understand how you feel.
You've just done some hard time...

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.426
Don't fucking talk to me about hard time.

01:04:08.594 --> 01:04:10.720
- You don't know a thing about it.
- I done mine.

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:13.139
You didn't do shit.
I found out about your story.

01:04:13.307 --> 01:04:16.935
You did two months, then rolled over
on two kids and let them go down for you.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.104
So don't feed me your fucking lies,
Cameron!

01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:22.858
All right, then. This is stupid.

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.526
I'm done.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:27.070
Look, you go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:29.948
Get your head on straight,
then I'll talk to you.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:32.075
But it doesn't matter if I don't, does it?

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:34.536
You got the next crop
all lined up and ready to go...

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.789
...you fucking chicken hawk!
- Excuse me?

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.417
You prey on people, Cam! You use them!

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:43.378
I lost three years of my life
for your fucking phony cause...

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.422
...but I am onto you,
you fucking snake.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.133
Hey, Derek. Watch it. Be careful.

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:49.551
Remember where you are.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:53.263
This is not a fucking country club
where you can waltz in and out of here...

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.098
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:58.351
I came in here to tell you one thing:
I am out. Out!

01:04:58.519 --> 01:04:59.644
And Danny is out too.

01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:02.272
You come near my family again,
I'll fucking kill you.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.774
Well, excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

01:05:04.942 --> 01:05:07.110
You can't come barking threats at me.

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:09.821
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:14.075
He's not some whining pussy like you.
He needs my help and I'll give it to him.

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.952
If you come near Danny again...

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.080
...I will feed you your fucking heart,
Cameron.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.041
I won't have to.

01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:24.002
He'll come to me.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:27.589
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:32.969
Shit!

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:36.056
You're a fucking dead man, Vinyard.

01:05:51.405 --> 01:05:53.198
Hey, hey, hey. Where's Cameron?

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:54.532
Where the fuck is he?

01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:57.702
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Derek.

01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:59.579
Stay away from me, Stacey. Danny!

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:01.998
Why don't you share
what you just said to me...

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:04.960
...you piece-of-shit, race-trading nigger!

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:07.212
Fucking nigger?
- You monkey-fucking traitor!

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.047
Are you a fucking nigger?

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.049
Hey, Danny! Come on.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:13.176
He's a fucking nigger. Nigger. Nigger.

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:14.636
Cam's out cold!

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.554
Where the fuck are you going?

01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:19.557
He's got a gun!

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:22.435
- Yo, yo, back up, back up.
Seth.

01:06:22.603 --> 01:06:25.021
You make me fucking sick!

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:27.315
Seth! Put down the fucking gun!

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:28.566
Go ahead. Shoot.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.404
- Shoot him! Do it, Seth! Shoot him!
Seth. Holy shit.

01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:33.697
Traitor.
- Kick his ass.

01:06:33.864 --> 01:06:36.074
- Seth!
- Do it, Seth, do it.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.867
- Shoot him.
Do it! Shoot him!

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:39.786
Oh, God.

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:41.037
Back up. Move.

01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:45.417
Back up. Back up. Back the fuck up.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:47.919
Move. Move.

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:49.212
Easy, Derek. Hey. Hey.

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:13.278
- Danny, easy.
- Fuck you. Who do you think you are?

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:15.280
Danny, Danny. Relax. Relax.

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:18.950
- Who do you think you are?
- Danny. Take it easy, Dan. Take it easy.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.453
I fucking hate you, Der!

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.538
All right. Shh, shh. I mean it.

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:26.541
Hey, come on. Come on.
Shut up. Shut up.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.793
- Take it easy.
- What's happened to you, Der?

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:31.963
Take it easy. Take it easy.

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.299
What's happened to you, Der?

01:07:42.808 --> 01:07:45.226
Come on. Come on.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.315
This is so fucked.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:51.983
Look. I'm sorry. All right?

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:54.778
You weren't supposed to see that.
I told you not to come.

01:07:54.945 --> 01:07:57.155
Fuck you, man.

01:07:57.656 --> 01:07:59.115
That was so fucked up.

01:07:59.283 --> 01:08:01.201
I know. I know.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.204
- God.
- It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

01:08:04.371 --> 01:08:05.914
That was fucked up.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.500
- That's all there is to it.
- Not what I had planned.

01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:11.252
It just all went to shit.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.505
It went to shit.

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:15.131
Totally out of control.

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:19.344
What's fucking happening to you, man?

01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:26.475
Hey. Look at me.

01:08:29.854 --> 01:08:31.356
I can't go back to that, Dan.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.691
Can't go back to what?

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:38.363
To any of it. Those guys, the gang,
that life. I'm done with it.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.035
What happened to you up there?

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:55.964
C Block! Back at the chow!
Don't be late today, you piece of shit!

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.841
Let's go! You wanna eat today?

01:08:58.008 --> 01:09:00.009
Get up! Five minutes!

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:02.345
This is my fucking house! Get up!

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:04.721
What the fuck's your problem,
you asshole?

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.515
Move!

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:07.975
Joe, open the fucking gates.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:09.935
All right, back up.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:17.152
Five minutes. Step forward.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.529
Those beds better be made.

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:25.577
After two days in that place,
I didn't think I'd make it a week.

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:27.245
Come on there, motherfuckers.

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:29.581
You wanna eat today, you piece of shit?

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:33.084
You white-trash piece of shit.
You think you're fucking special?

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:36.754
Button that top button. Let's go! Move!

01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:40.049
Are you fucking eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole.

01:09:40.216 --> 01:09:42.385
I'll fucking kill you.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.596
Fucking keep my eye on you,
you white piece of shit.

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:50.435
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy,
or I'll fucking skull-fuck you!

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.353
Step forward.

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:55.773
Turn to the left.

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:59.277
Step forward to chow. Let's go.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:01.446
Come on.

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:04.032
Hey, fish, straight ahead.
Straight ahead, fucker.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.241
Let's go.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:08.369
All the wrong people
knew who I was anyway...

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:11.831
...so I figured I'm just gonna put up a flag
and hope a friend sees it.

01:11:15.187 --> 01:11:16.938
That's the catapult right there.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.042
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.711
Have a seat.

01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:44.090
- Spike. Good to meet you.
- Hey.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:56.728
Don't fuck with me, all right? Because
I'm the most dangerous man in this prison.

01:11:57.604 --> 01:11:58.813
You know why?

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.607
Because I control the underwear.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:11.951
All right, we pick them up over here
and we sort them over there.

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:14.912
I hope you work out, all right?
The last guy they sent me...

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.042
...didn't wear no drawers,
couldn't read the sizes in the drawers...

01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:21.002
...and used to sniff the drawers.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.254
We got two sizes: Medium and large.
All right?

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:25.882
All you do is put the mediums
with the mediums...

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.592
...and the large with the large.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.346
It's a boring job, but it's better than
that last shit they had me doing.

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:35.767
I spent two years in the kitchen, ha,
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:38.728
That, you don't wanna do. All right?

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:40.938
You should be happy
that you landed this job.

01:12:41.106 --> 01:12:44.442
Ain't no telling what the hell
they'll have you do in the joint.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:47.320
By the way, uh...

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:50.365
...what are you in for?

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:55.620
Probably robbed some old lady, huh?

01:13:06.965 --> 01:13:09.092
Okay, I know your kind, right?

01:13:09.259 --> 01:13:11.469
Badass peckerwood with an attitude.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.223
Well, let me tell you something, man.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.100
You better watch your ass.

01:13:17.267 --> 01:13:19.018
Because in the joint...

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.145
...you the nigger, not me.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:28.736
I was a year in. I thought I was cruising.

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:31.656
Then everything
started getting complicated.

01:13:56.723 --> 01:13:58.349
I'll take care of that, all right?

01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:00.143
What the fuck is that?

01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:03.479
What's that all about?

01:14:03.647 --> 01:14:06.858
Oh, that's just politics, man.
Favors, you know.

01:14:09.027 --> 01:14:11.112
He's doing favors for that fucking spic?

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:17.201
Mitch has got a little something extra
on the side with them boys, you know.

01:14:17.911 --> 01:14:19.287
You're kidding, right?

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:21.456
No.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:25.501
That's bullshit, man.
Somebody should say something to him.

01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:27.253
What the fuck is he thinking?

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:29.714
Mitch is the only reason
why you're not a corpse.

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.092
- Remember that.
- You know what? I don't fucking give a shit.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.387
I can take care of myself.
He shouldn't be doing that.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:39.557
I'm getting sick of it.
A lot of hard talk around here...

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.976
...and not a lot of follow-through.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.230
I think you'd better chill out...

01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:50.193
...on the preaching bullshit, okay?
We're getting a little tired of that shit.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:53.738
Ease up on it.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.478
What are you doing here, Doris?

01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:27.271
I was in the neighborhood.

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:30.066
Well, look, I told you I don't want you
all coming here.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:33.110
I don't care what you told me, okay?

01:15:33.278 --> 01:15:34.570
I need to talk to you now.

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:56.717
So how is everyone?

01:15:56.885 --> 01:16:02.306
Davina's great.
She's, uh, getting straight A's almost.

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:04.725
And, uh, Ally's walking...

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:07.061
...and starting to talk a little.

01:16:11.775 --> 01:16:14.735
- How's Danny?
- Danny?

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:17.572
Danny.

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:21.409
He holds you up so high.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.995
He thinks you're the greatest.

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:27.957
He's always bragging about you
to Cameron...

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:29.917
...and all his new friends.

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:35.715
He's starting to remind me of you.

01:16:35.882 --> 01:16:38.551
Jesus, don't sound so worried, all right?

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.219
I'm sure he's fine.

01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:44.181
I mean, he's 16 years old, Doris.
He's not gonna be a little angel forever.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.019
You think because I watched
my first-born fuck up his entire life...

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:52.189
...that I can sit here and see my baby
follow him down the same toilet?

01:16:52.357 --> 01:16:54.984
You know what?
I can't fix all this shit from up here, okay?

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:56.527
I'm not asking you to.

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:59.864
It makes me feel bad. I'm trying to get
through this, you make it harder.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:03.034
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.620
You think you're here all alone?

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.622
You think I'm not in here with you?

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.677
Fuck, man.

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:28.726
Every day you go through these sheets
like you gonna get to the end of them.

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:32.313
Look, nigga, will you chill the fuck out?

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:35.691
Goddamn! No matter how fast
you get through them, man...

01:17:35.859 --> 01:17:38.361
...they'll keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:42.239
Throwing them around ain't gonna do
a thing but give you a heart attack.

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:43.908
Know what? That's cool with me.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:46.494
But you're gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack too!

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:57.755
I know, I know.
I'm just a dumb stupid nigger, right?

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.632
What do I know?

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:04.303
I know I ain't the one getting mad
at them damn sheets, though.

01:18:04.888 --> 01:18:08.891
As a matter of fact, the only sheets
I get mad at? I'll tell you.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:13.604
"Boys, this is what we gonna do.

01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:15.439
We gonna hate some niggers.

01:18:15.607 --> 01:18:19.443
We gonna hate some goddamn niggers.
That's all we'll do, is hate niggers all day.

01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:22.029
I don't know what a nigger is,
but we'll hate them.

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:24.115
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now...

01:18:24.282 --> 01:18:28.369
...working next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy. "

01:18:46.596 --> 01:18:48.889
See? That's the ticket.

01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:51.851
Nice and easy.

01:18:52.686 --> 01:18:54.478
Now we can ignore each other in peace.

01:18:58.525 --> 01:19:00.568
I go, "What you doing?"
Know what he tells me?

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:03.821
He goes, "It's better than the pig
I just tried to fuck. "

01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:08.117
Never lets me finish.

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:10.995
Why don't you tell a joke?
Did you fuck him too?

01:19:12.664 --> 01:19:16.959
I get back, she's laying on her back.
She likes the wine bottle thing, right?

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.670
What's up?

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.803
Will you get to the fucking point?
Jesus Christ.

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:37.855
He was taking it from the Mexicans
and dealing it out to his own people.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:41.484
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:43.736
Took too damn long.

01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:53.120
Hey. Hey, Vinyard!

01:20:06.927 --> 01:20:08.511
What?

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:11.597
Come on, man. Don't look at me like that.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.141
You know what that smells like, right?

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:17.394
Come on, don't tell me this smell
doesn't remind you of a woman.

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:20.356
God, I miss that smell, man.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.819
The job I had on the outside
wasn't much better than this one.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:28.572
But at least I gotta go home at night
and lie down next to this sweet smell.

01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:33.536
God, I miss that.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.205
You got a woman?

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:37.873
Yeah, you got a woman, man.

01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:40.709
Let me give you some advice. All right?

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:42.920
She comes to visit you...

01:20:43.713 --> 01:20:47.591
...whatever you do, no matter what,
don't let her leave here in a fight.

01:20:47.759 --> 01:20:50.845
Don't let her walk out of here
with a bad attitude. If you do...

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:55.766
...you spend next week wondering if she's
getting her fuck on with somebody else.

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:59.228
She comes to see you it's nothing
but sweet talk through that glass.

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:01.772
Send her away floating, all right?

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.942
Because it's not like the real world.
Where you can fight...

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:08.696
...but it's cool to fight because you
can make up and have make-up sex.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:11.949
You know what I'm saying? That angry sex.
That sex with an attitude.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:15.619
Where you lay on your back and let her
take out all that aggression on you.

01:21:15.787 --> 01:21:17.705
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.874
It's that pow, pow, pow.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.877
Let her get on top
and she's gonna punish you first, right?

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:24.545
"You been a bad boy, huh?

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:27.423
You been a bad boy
and I'm gonna punish you.

01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:32.720
I'm gonna put it on you.
Don't you ever let me catch you...

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.471
...looking at another woman.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:37.516
Yeah. I may forgive you if you bring it.

01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:40.019
I think I can. I forgive.

01:21:40.186 --> 01:21:43.689
I forgive. Oh, right there. Right there.
You hitting it. My spot.

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:47.985
That's it. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
Yes. I forgive you.

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:51.655
I forgive you. I for... I for... I forgive you.

01:21:51.823 --> 01:21:53.824
I love you!"

01:21:57.662 --> 01:21:59.330
Let's keep it moving.

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:15.095
How do you figure the Lakers to ever
be a bigger dynasty than the Celtics?

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:18.474
- The Lakers are like a flare-up. A fluke.
- Are you crazy?

01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:21.602
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are like a dynasty!

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:26.190
Come on, man. The Celtics were, like,
the ugliest team in the history of sports.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:28.275
A dynasty of ugly motherfuckers, man.

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:30.486
Look at Kevin McHale.

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:33.322
James Worthy?
The guy has a head like a melon.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:36.033
- No, he had ladies.
- I can't even talk to you.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.869
- I don't even know what you're saying.
- You are tweaking.

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:41.121
Boston Celtics.

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:42.623
- How many is that?
- That's enough.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.375
Enough? All right.

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.552
I lost count, man.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.554
- Doesn't matter, man.
- All right.

01:22:57.722 --> 01:22:59.556
Who's counting anyway?

01:23:06.564 --> 01:23:08.524
All right, so I wanna know something.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:11.568
What the fuck landed you in here?

01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:13.821
You didn't kill.
Too skinny for a gangbanger.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:17.992
That a bitch. Don't judge a book by its
cover. I can throw these things, all right?

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:21.412
- You know what I'm saying?
- Whatever. Come on. What did you do?

01:23:21.579 --> 01:23:25.416
Yo, man, it's none of your business,
all right? It's embarrassing, all right?

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:29.795
What? Embar...?
Everybody in here is embarrassed.

01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:32.923
You think? Nobody in here
got away with anything.

01:23:33.299 --> 01:23:34.925
What did you do?

01:23:36.636 --> 01:23:39.763
Look, man, I stole a TV, all right?

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:41.765
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing?

01:23:41.933 --> 01:23:46.020
I stole a TV from a store that was right
next door to a doughnut shop, all right?

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:49.106
I run out, the store owner's
running behind me, yelling, bam.

01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:51.692
I run into three cops, all right?

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.944
I told you it was embarrassing
and you laugh.

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:56.280
Wait a second. Wait a second.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:58.907
That doesn't make sense.

01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:02.369
No, you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV.

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:05.789
- Come on.
- I go in the store, I come out...

01:24:05.957 --> 01:24:09.293
...the police officer grabs my arm,
TV falls on his foot and breaks it.

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:11.628
They said I threw the TV at the officer.

01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:13.756
Assault. Six years.

01:24:13.923 --> 01:24:15.758
Come on. Tell the truth.

01:24:15.925 --> 01:24:17.801
You chucked it at him. Or something.

01:24:17.969 --> 01:24:20.929
Like I said, I came out of the store...

01:24:21.097 --> 01:24:24.641
...he grabbed my arm, it fell on his foot.

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:33.442
What you got for me, baby?
What you got for me? What you got for me?

01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:36.862
There you go, baby. Yeah, baby.

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:38.989
That's what I'm talking about!

01:24:43.286 --> 01:24:44.870
Put some D on him, now.

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.028
Fuck you.

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:20.030
Get a towel! Hold him. Hold him.

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:30.040
- You wanna be a nigger, sweet boy?
- Fuck you!

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:32.543
We're gonna treat you like one.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.379
Come on.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.228
Fuck you.

01:25:56.734 --> 01:25:58.318
- That was real sweet.
- Fuck you!

01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:33.937
How is he?

01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:36.064
Well, he took six stitches.

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:45.657
Hey, man.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.484
Oh, man, what the hell
are you doing here, anyway?

01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:24.321
Well, I came to talk about Danny,
but we don't have to do that right now.

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:25.739
I brought you some books.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:31.328
Well, what about him? You know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

01:27:31.955 --> 01:27:33.997
He's headed right where you are.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:39.086
Oh, man, you know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me, man.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:41.380
Danny's not my responsibility.
You know?

01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:45.050
What do you expect me to do? It
doesn't help. Am I supposed to feel guilty?

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:49.513
I don't want you to do anything. I need
to know the truth about how you feel.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.891
Well, what?
You think I want him in here? I mean...

01:27:53.059 --> 01:27:56.311
I don't know. I don't know what I feel.
I'm all...

01:27:58.314 --> 01:27:59.856
I feel a little inside out.

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:03.694
Um, you know, I don't know.
There's some things...

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:06.029
...that don't fit.

01:28:06.197 --> 01:28:07.990
Well, that happens.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.868
Look, you are too damn smart
to be floating around here...

01:28:12.036 --> 01:28:14.621
...pretending you don't see
the holes in this bullshit.

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:17.791
Listen, I said I was confused.
I didn't say I didn't believe in it.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:20.335
All right.
That's why you have to stay open.

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:23.046
Right now, your anger is consuming you.

01:28:23.214 --> 01:28:26.216
Your anger is shutting down the brain
God gave you.

01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:29.886
You've been talking about what's going
on in me since I was in high school.

01:28:30.054 --> 01:28:33.056
How the fuck do you know so much
about what's going on inside me?

01:28:33.224 --> 01:28:35.350
No, I know about me.

01:28:35.518 --> 01:28:39.730
I know about this place.
I know about the place you are in.

01:28:40.273 --> 01:28:42.399
What do you know
about the place I'm in?

01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:44.443
There was a moment...

01:28:44.610 --> 01:28:47.446
...when I used to blame
everything and everyone...

01:28:47.613 --> 01:28:51.700
...for all the pain and suffering
and vile things that happened to me...

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:54.244
...that I saw happen to my people.

01:28:55.204 --> 01:28:57.122
I used to blame everybody.
Blame white people.

01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:59.875
Blame society. Blame God.

01:29:00.293 --> 01:29:03.920
I didn't get no answers, because
I was asking the wrong questions.

01:29:04.088 --> 01:29:06.757
- You have to ask the right questions.
- Like what?

01:29:09.552 --> 01:29:12.095
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

01:29:23.107 --> 01:29:24.441
No.

01:29:32.658 --> 01:29:34.034
You gotta help me now.

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:38.955
Just help me.

01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:42.459
Get me out of here, you know?

01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:48.215
I'm up in four months for review.

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:51.551
Put in a word for me.

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:54.137
I already have.
So you're out there, then what?

01:29:54.305 --> 01:29:56.973
I don't wanna fuck up
my family anymore.

01:29:57.141 --> 01:29:59.309
I'll go as far away as I can get.

01:29:59.977 --> 01:30:01.103
That's not good enough.

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:07.109
You want my help, you gotta do better
than that. My help is not unconditional.

01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:11.071
But running just ain't good enough.

01:30:44.021 --> 01:30:45.313
Fuck him.

01:30:45.481 --> 01:30:48.150
Fuck him. Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.695
Yo, what's up, D?

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:54.906
Yo, what's all that bullshit you pulled
in the mess hall, man?

01:30:55.533 --> 01:30:58.285
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you fucking crazy?

01:30:59.495 --> 01:31:01.621
D! Look at me, man!

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.206
You can't make it on your own.

01:31:03.374 --> 01:31:07.335
I'm not afraid of those fucking pussies.
There was six of them, they jumped me.

01:31:07.503 --> 01:31:09.963
That won't happen again.
I hope they fucking try.

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:12.674
Look, I'm not talking about
your peckerwood friends!

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:15.051
They were protecting your stupid ass!

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:17.053
You dissed them in public.

01:31:17.221 --> 01:31:19.264
Now you're on your fucking own!

01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:21.641
Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers.

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:25.479
They're gonna fuck you, toss your salad,
then smoke your motherfucking ass!

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:29.566
Tell me something I don't already know.
You think I haven't thought about that?

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:32.861
They're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come. Nothing I can do.

01:31:35.239 --> 01:31:37.282
What can I do, man?

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:43.747
So I was right back where I started.

01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:45.665
Every day, I was sure it was my day.

01:31:47.543 --> 01:31:49.961
Every time I stepped out of my cell.

01:31:50.129 --> 01:31:52.589
Every time I got in that shower.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:59.554
I figured it was only a matter of time
before they made a move.

01:32:01.265 --> 01:32:03.642
I just hoped that it'd be quick.

01:32:35.299 --> 01:32:37.342
But it never came.

01:32:38.761 --> 01:32:41.888
I couldn't figure it out.
I knew some of them were itching for it.

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:44.474
But after a while
I just put my head down...

01:32:44.642 --> 01:32:47.978
...read the stuff that Sweeney sent me,
and I kept to myself.

01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:53.275
The last six months in that place
I was like a ghost.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:09.583
What's up, man? You getting out?

01:33:12.878 --> 01:33:15.672
What the fuck you waiting on?
Get the fuck on out of here.

01:33:18.134 --> 01:33:21.469
- Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:27.767
I'm thinking maybe the only reason
I'm getting out of here in one piece is you.

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:29.978
Come on, man.
Get the fuck out of here, man!

01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:33.607
You think I'm gonna put my neck on the line
for a crazy-ass peckerwood?

01:33:34.525 --> 01:33:37.694
Yeah. Right. Stupid.

01:33:43.576 --> 01:33:45.368
That's what I thought.

01:33:49.582 --> 01:33:51.541
I owe you, man.

01:33:52.376 --> 01:33:54.711
Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?

01:33:57.048 --> 01:33:58.923
Yes, I do.

01:34:08.851 --> 01:34:10.185
You'll be out in no time.

01:34:10.353 --> 01:34:12.479
Come on, man.
It's a piece of cake. All right?

01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:17.692
You just take it easy on the brothers,
all right? The brothers!

01:34:28.287 --> 01:34:30.246
God, man.

01:34:32.124 --> 01:34:34.417
I'm sorry, Der.

01:34:34.752 --> 01:34:37.212
Sorry that happened to you.

01:34:38.255 --> 01:34:41.383
No, I'm not. I'm lucky.

01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:43.134
I feel lucky because...

01:34:43.302 --> 01:34:45.220
...it's wrong, Dan.

01:34:46.972 --> 01:34:50.934
It's wrong and it was eating me up.
It was gonna kill me.

01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:53.812
And I kept asking myself all the time...

01:34:53.979 --> 01:34:56.940
...how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

01:34:58.609 --> 01:35:00.860
And it's just because I was pissed off.

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:05.156
And nothing I ever did
ever took that feeling away.

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.952
I mean, I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

01:35:11.288 --> 01:35:13.707
And that didn't make me
feel any different.

01:35:14.625 --> 01:35:18.086
It just got me more lost.
And I'm tired of feeling pissed off, Danny.

01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:20.630
I'm just tired of it.

01:35:21.966 --> 01:35:24.134
And I'm not telling you what to do.

01:35:24.969 --> 01:35:26.636
I'm really not.

01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:29.639
But I need you to understand.

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:33.977
Because I love you
and you're my best friend.

01:35:36.772 --> 01:35:38.565
Do you understand?

01:35:38.733 --> 01:35:40.692
Yeah, I understand.

01:35:44.447 --> 01:35:45.822
All right.

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:49.325
Whoo!

01:35:49.493 --> 01:35:51.202
Jesus.

01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:08.470
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:36:08.637 --> 01:36:10.930
- Everything okay?
No, everything's great.

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:13.683
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:17.145
- No, thank you. Yeah. This is good. I'm fine.
- You sure?

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:19.481
Thank you, though.

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.941
All right. Come on, let's go.

01:36:42.838 --> 01:36:44.380
Good night.

01:37:51.448 --> 01:37:53.199
I'm gonna take a shower, all right?

01:38:26.901 --> 01:38:31.321
It's hard to look back
and see the truth about people you love.

01:38:31.488 --> 01:38:35.658
I think if you asked Derek why it all went
the way it did, and where it all started...

01:38:35.826 --> 01:38:38.494
...he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.

01:38:39.622 --> 01:38:41.956
But the truth is, it started earlier.

01:38:42.374 --> 01:38:45.251
All right. Are we all meeting together
for the game tonight?

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.753
Yes, definitely.

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:49.547
Ben's Burgers, 7:00,
then we go watch the big guy play.

01:38:49.715 --> 01:38:51.925
Okay. Yeah.

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:55.511
- Psyching up for the game?
- Yeah, I'm always ready for that.

01:38:55.679 --> 01:38:59.682
I got an English exam third period.
I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.

01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:02.477
What's the matter,
afraid you're gonna get a B?

01:39:02.645 --> 01:39:04.479
Might do you good. B minus.

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:07.357
Don't laugh. This guy is different.

01:39:07.524 --> 01:39:11.986
Dr. Sweeney? This guy's unbelievable.
I've never had a teacher like this.

01:39:12.154 --> 01:39:14.948
He's got two Ph. D.s.
I don't know what he's doing at our school.

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:18.201
- He's not like other teachers.
- What's he got you reading?

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:21.871
We got this essay exam on this book,
Native Son.

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:24.540
- All on this one book.
- Native Son. I don't know that.

01:39:24.708 --> 01:39:25.959
That's a big surprise.

01:39:27.544 --> 01:39:29.796
What? I read.

01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:33.049
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy at school.

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:36.719
Well, they don't.

01:39:36.887 --> 01:39:39.263
So, what is it? What is this Native Son?
What is it?

01:39:39.431 --> 01:39:41.557
It's this book about this black guy.

01:39:42.142 --> 01:39:44.560
We're doing this
whole black literature unit.

01:39:45.354 --> 01:39:47.021
What is it, Black History Month?

01:39:47.398 --> 01:39:48.606
No, it's just like...

01:39:48.774 --> 01:39:51.401
This guy Sweeney, you know,
it's part of the course now.

01:39:54.697 --> 01:39:56.364
Yeah.

01:39:58.409 --> 01:39:59.659
What?

01:40:00.619 --> 01:40:02.495
Nothing. It's just, you know.

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:04.539
It's everywhere I look now.

01:40:05.624 --> 01:40:06.916
What?

01:40:08.335 --> 01:40:10.878
This affirmative blaction.

01:40:11.922 --> 01:40:15.842
Honey, a few new books
doesn't qualify as affirmative black action.

01:40:17.094 --> 01:40:18.761
Read the book, ace the guy's test.

01:40:18.929 --> 01:40:21.264
Just don't swallow everything
he feeds you whole.

01:40:21.432 --> 01:40:23.933
- Just because you see it on the news.
- But like what?

01:40:24.101 --> 01:40:27.437
All this stuff about making everything equal.
It's not that simple.

01:40:27.604 --> 01:40:29.313
Now you got this book, Native Son.

01:40:29.481 --> 01:40:31.607
What happened to the other books
in the course?

01:40:31.775 --> 01:40:35.820
They're not any good anymore because
Mr. Two-Ph. D. S says they aren't?

01:40:35.988 --> 01:40:39.949
Are you gonna trade in great books
for black books? Does that make sense?

01:40:41.326 --> 01:40:43.202
You gotta question these things, Derek.

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:45.371
You gotta look at the whole picture.

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:48.624
We're talking about books here.
But I'm also talking about my job.

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:52.336
I got two black guys on my squad now
who got their job...

01:40:52.504 --> 01:40:56.132
...over a couple of white guys
who actually scored higher on the test.

01:40:57.426 --> 01:41:01.137
That make sense? Huh?
Yeah, sure, everything's equal now...

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:05.558
...but I got two guys watching my back,
responsible for my life...

01:41:05.726 --> 01:41:09.395
...who aren't as good as two others.
They got the job because they were black.

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:12.356
- Not because they were the best.
- That sucks.

01:41:12.524 --> 01:41:14.442
Yeah. Is that what America is about?

01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:16.736
No. America's about
"best man for the job. "

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:18.988
You do your best, you get the job.

01:41:19.156 --> 01:41:22.450
You know, this affirmative action crap...

01:41:22.618 --> 01:41:24.869
I don't know what that's about.
There's some...

01:41:25.037 --> 01:41:27.663
...hidden agenda or something going on.

01:41:27.831 --> 01:41:29.916
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I do.

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:32.502
I don't know,
I didn't think about it like that.

01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:35.046
- Well...
- This guy, though...

01:41:35.214 --> 01:41:38.132
I don't know. Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on, like, so strong...

01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:40.510
...it's kind of hard not to listen to him.

01:41:40.677 --> 01:41:42.637
Maybe some of what he says is kind of...

01:41:42.805 --> 01:41:44.430
It's bullshit.

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:46.849
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

01:41:47.017 --> 01:41:48.601
No, no.

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:51.270
It's nigger bullshit.

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.691
- You see that, don't you?
- Yeah.

01:41:56.527 --> 01:42:00.530
- You gotta watch out for that.
- Yeah, I get what you're saying. I will.

01:42:02.407 --> 01:42:03.866
Good boy.

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:08.329
- I'm proud of you.
- Don't worry about it. I got it.

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:13.496
It's 5:40 a. M...

01:44:13.664 --> 01:44:18.084
...and in about one minute,
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

01:44:18.335 --> 01:44:20.628
I don't know if I've ever done that.

01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:25.174
Anyway, we're gonna try
to pick things up and start over.

01:44:25.342 --> 01:44:28.302
It won't be easy,
but we're all together again.

01:44:29.179 --> 01:44:31.264
And I feel good.

01:44:32.474 --> 01:44:34.809
I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted.

01:44:34.977 --> 01:44:38.771
If I hit the social significance,
or whatever you're looking for.

01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:43.234
But, for what it's worth, thanks a lot.

01:44:57.541 --> 01:44:59.959
Wow. You look great.

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:01.961
Look at you.

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:05.715
Yeah. Gotta dress up
for the parole officer.

01:45:06.216 --> 01:45:07.633
Is she cute?

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:10.386
She is a fat guy named Hector.

01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:12.513
So I'm out of luck.

01:45:15.517 --> 01:45:18.644
I just gotta check in,
then I'll see about getting my old job back.

01:45:19.313 --> 01:45:20.563
Great.

01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:22.732
- Good morning.
Yes, my love.

01:45:22.899 --> 01:45:26.777
Davina, can you...?
Your sister's gonna help you, honey.

01:45:26.945 --> 01:45:28.863
You look great. Knock them dead.
- Okay.

01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:30.323
Thanks.

01:45:30.574 --> 01:45:34.869
What would you like to wear?
I wanna wear my blue dress today.

01:45:35.037 --> 01:45:38.164
- You do look good.
- Yeah? I feel silly.

01:45:38.332 --> 01:45:40.416
- You look good.
Yeah?

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:44.337
You feel good?

01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:50.176
Yeah. Yeah. I feel, you know...

01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:52.428
...a little...

01:45:52.596 --> 01:45:54.430
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

01:45:56.266 --> 01:45:59.393
Listen, I don't know...

01:45:59.561 --> 01:46:02.396
I don't know if it's okay that I'm here.

01:46:06.151 --> 01:46:08.402
I wanna be here.

01:46:26.296 --> 01:46:27.755
- I'm gonna get a paper.
- Cool.

01:46:45.399 --> 01:46:48.025
- What do you want?
- A maple bar and a large milk.

01:46:48.193 --> 01:46:49.860
All right, I got it.

01:46:54.866 --> 01:46:58.536
Let me get a coffee, a maple bar
and a large milk to go.

01:46:58.703 --> 01:47:00.162
Right away.

01:47:08.296 --> 01:47:10.131
Hey, Derek.
- Hey.

01:47:11.133 --> 01:47:12.341
Derek.

01:47:12.509 --> 01:47:15.010
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?

01:47:15.178 --> 01:47:19.056
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

01:47:19.224 --> 01:47:21.475
- They were jumped last night.
- How bad?

01:47:21.643 --> 01:47:23.894
Well, it looks like they're gonna live.

01:47:24.062 --> 01:47:27.148
- Then they got lucky.
- Somebody's gotta lose, though.

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.069
Aw, what?

01:47:32.237 --> 01:47:35.364
We were kind of hoping that maybe
you'd talk to your old crew.

01:47:35.532 --> 01:47:37.700
- Come on. No way.
This is not a good thing.

01:47:37.868 --> 01:47:40.035
If there's anybody they'll listen to,
it's you.

01:47:40.203 --> 01:47:42.455
No. No, I hate to tell you, but I'm out.

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:44.665
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

01:47:44.833 --> 01:47:46.709
We're asking for your help here, Derek.

01:47:46.877 --> 01:47:49.336
- Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
- Derek.

01:47:55.552 --> 01:47:57.219
This has got nothing to do with me.

01:47:57.387 --> 01:48:00.181
Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.

01:48:00.348 --> 01:48:03.058
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.

01:48:03.226 --> 01:48:05.728
I'm going like this to keep
my family in the clear.

01:48:05.896 --> 01:48:08.355
- Don't ask me to fix this.
- I'm not asking that.

01:48:08.523 --> 01:48:12.443
- It was there before me.
- You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

01:48:12.611 --> 01:48:14.862
You take a break, you'll find no peace.

01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:17.406
The way to find peace is to stick.

01:48:18.241 --> 01:48:20.576
It's not gonna make
a fucking bit of difference.

01:48:20.744 --> 01:48:22.286
It might.

01:48:23.705 --> 01:48:26.081
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you?

01:48:26.249 --> 01:48:29.335
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever is in your power to do.

01:48:32.422 --> 01:48:33.756
Man.

01:48:35.717 --> 01:48:37.218
Fuck.

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.766
All right.

01:48:45.936 --> 01:48:47.895
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

01:48:48.063 --> 01:48:50.773
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, well...

01:48:50.941 --> 01:48:54.318
...we're all gonna have a laugh at that,
let me tell you.

01:48:54.486 --> 01:48:57.738
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

01:48:57.906 --> 01:48:59.281
Come on.

01:48:59.449 --> 01:49:02.743
Hey, you. You got
something good for me this morning?

01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:06.455
- I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
- Yeah, okay.

01:49:10.794 --> 01:49:12.294
What's going on?

01:49:17.801 --> 01:49:19.260
Come on.

01:49:35.151 --> 01:49:38.153
This is so bad for Seth, man.

01:49:38.321 --> 01:49:41.490
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
- I don't know.

01:49:41.658 --> 01:49:44.660
I'm glad they're not dead,
but other than that, I don't care.

01:49:45.495 --> 01:49:46.787
Should we visit them?

01:49:46.955 --> 01:49:49.081
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:51.584
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

01:49:51.751 --> 01:49:53.544
Listen, too...

01:49:53.712 --> 01:49:57.756
...I saw a car cruising by the house last
night when I pulled out of there with Seth.

01:49:57.924 --> 01:50:00.718
If you get home before me,
look around the street, all right?

01:50:00.885 --> 01:50:02.845
Make sure there's nothing going on.

01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:06.140
Oh, man. This is bad.

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:11.437
- They're after you, man.
- It'll cool off.

01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:13.272
If I made it through Chino...

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:17.026
...this should be a piece of cake, right?

01:50:17.193 --> 01:50:20.362
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:23.198
Okay.

01:50:23.783 --> 01:50:25.242
What are you gonna do?

01:50:25.410 --> 01:50:27.161
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.

01:50:27.329 --> 01:50:29.455
Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.

01:50:29.623 --> 01:50:31.457
It's gonna be fine.

01:50:31.625 --> 01:50:33.334
Go turn that paper in.

01:50:35.545 --> 01:50:38.213
- Okay. All right, see you.
- Hey, hey, Dan.

01:50:46.056 --> 01:50:47.681
I'll see you at home.

01:50:49.601 --> 01:50:51.185
All right?

01:50:51.561 --> 01:50:52.811
Yeah, I'll see you.

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:55.147
- Hey, good luck, all right?
- Yeah.

01:50:55.523 --> 01:50:57.066
See you later.

01:51:02.989 --> 01:51:04.948
- We're gonna be late.
We'd better go.

01:51:05.116 --> 01:51:07.701
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

01:51:30.767 --> 01:51:33.686
- Fine.
- All right. I'll catch up with you, all right?

01:51:33.937 --> 01:51:35.479
See you later.

01:52:56.060 --> 01:52:57.478
- Derek, no!
- Get out of my way!

01:52:57.645 --> 01:52:59.730
- All right. All right.
- Get out of my way!

01:52:59.898 --> 01:53:01.315
Let him go!

01:53:02.984 --> 01:53:07.029
Oh, no. No! No! No!

01:53:07.363 --> 01:53:09.531
Oh, Jesus.

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:14.036
No.

01:53:14.204 --> 01:53:18.373
Oh, no, no. No.

01:53:32.931 --> 01:53:34.640
Oh, Jesus.

01:53:34.808 --> 01:53:36.975
God, what did I do?

01:53:50.365 --> 01:53:54.827
Oh, God.

01:54:05.755 --> 01:54:08.382
So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:10.926
My conclusion, right?

01:54:11.761 --> 01:54:13.846
Well, my conclusion is...

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:16.014
...hate is baggage.

01:54:16.266 --> 01:54:19.560
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

01:54:20.103 --> 01:54:21.979
It's just not worth it.

01:54:24.774 --> 01:54:27.901
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

01:54:28.403 --> 01:54:30.445
He says someone else
has already said it best...

01:54:30.613 --> 01:54:35.117
...so if you can't top it,
steal from them and go out strong.

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:37.953
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:42.916
"We are not enemies, but friends.

01:54:43.084 --> 01:54:45.502
We must not be enemies.

01:54:45.670 --> 01:54:47.880
Though passion may have strained...

01:54:48.047 --> 01:54:51.300
...it must not break
our bonds of affection.

01:54:51.467 --> 01:54:56.305
The mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched...

01:54:56.472 --> 01:55:01.101
...as surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature. "
