01:33.093 --> 01:34.254
<i>Hedy wanted to do</i>

01:34.469 --> 01:36.256
<i>something important
with her life.</i>

01:36.471 --> 01:39.305
<i>She wanted to make her mark.</i>

01:39.516 --> 01:42.259
<i>But she was totally judged
by that face.</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:48.431
One of the most
glamorous stars

01:48.650 --> 01:50.141
show business
ever has produced...

01:50.360 --> 01:52.943
One of the most glamorous stars
the screen has ever known...

01:53.155 --> 01:55.067
And one of the most beautiful
women in the world...

01:55.282 --> 01:56.272
Well, shall we all
say it together?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.323
- I think we all know.
- ♪ The most beautiful girl

01:58.535 --> 01:59.867
in the world ♪

02:00.078 --> 02:01.159
Hedy Lamarr.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.784
<i>She becomes the model
for Snow White.</i>

02:03.999 --> 02:06.332
<i>And she inspired Catwoman.</i>

02:06.543 --> 02:09.160
Oh, my God, I mean, she was...

02:09.378 --> 02:14.124
she was the best-looking
movie star that ever lived.

02:14.343 --> 02:17.336
She became my inspiration.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.386
Thank you, thank you,
Hedy, thank you.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.807
It's not Hedy, it's Hedley,
Hedley LaMarr.

02:23.018 --> 02:26.887
I don't know whether it's true,
but you hear things.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.223
I heard that she was
a scientist.

02:30.442 --> 02:31.273
So is this true?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.273
Within the nerd community
at Google,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.775
Hedy Lamarr was
this beloved figure.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.108
For me, she is
this perfect underdog,

02:40.327 --> 02:42.614
like,
crime-fighter-by-night story

02:42.829 --> 02:46.197
because she lived this life
of great accomplishments

02:46.416 --> 02:49.830
and people
didn't really know about it.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.004
I remember sitting up
in a bare attic with my mother,

02:53.215 --> 02:55.332
she said,
"Look, I got a patent."

02:55.550 --> 02:56.836
"You got a patent, Mom?"

02:57.052 --> 02:58.714
- "Yeah."
- "You invented something?"

02:58.929 --> 03:03.344
"Yeah, I invented a secret
communication system, look."

03:03.558 --> 03:06.392
And, today, we have Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.765
That's my mother's technology.

03:08.980 --> 03:09.936
You see?

03:10.148 --> 03:11.855
No.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.979
Well, it is kind of hard
to explain.

03:15.487 --> 03:20.983
Hedy had one of the most
recognizable faces of her time,

03:21.201 --> 03:23.534
and yet, she said
she was never seen

03:23.745 --> 03:26.909
for who she was.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.160
So, who was she?

03:35.674 --> 03:38.132
Tell me something
that I didn't know about you.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.170
I want to be a simple... I am!

03:42.389 --> 03:46.008
I'm a very simple,
complicated person.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.392
Could you help her?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.139
- Yes, but not here.
- But you know what I mean?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.436
You know what I mean!

03:51.648 --> 03:54.561
This book you're writing now,
Hedy, are there...

03:54.776 --> 03:58.895
Incidents, things that
nobody ever knew about me.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.447
- Regrets?
- Oh, no, no regrets.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.820
You learn from everything
all the time.

04:04.035 --> 04:04.866
When I was a child,

04:05.078 --> 04:06.740
she was always working
on her story.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.322
She was going to let
the world know her version

04:09.541 --> 04:11.954
and her story
and her autobiography

04:12.169 --> 04:14.912
in her words, but yet,
it never came to be.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.168
Hedy became a recluse.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.249
She wouldn't even see
her family.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.427
We wanted to spend time
with her,

04:23.638 --> 04:26.255
but she kept us away.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.011
There was so much scandal.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.344
There were different chapters
of scandal.

04:31.563 --> 04:35.307
There was her movie <i>Ecstasy</i>
that she made as an adolescent,

04:35.525 --> 04:38.609
the nudity and the explicitness
of that,

04:38.820 --> 04:42.279
and then the multiple
marriages and divorces,

04:42.491 --> 04:44.357
and then the arrests.

04:44.576 --> 04:48.320
My mother has a hard side
and an easy side,

04:48.538 --> 04:53.283
and as her son, growing up
with Hedy was difficult.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.332
I mean, she had so many sides
and so many faces,

04:57.547 --> 05:01.257
and even I couldn't understand
who Hedy Lamarr was.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.348
I'd been waiting for somebody
to contact me

05:09.559 --> 05:11.141
about Hedy Lamarr

05:11.353 --> 05:13.219
because I had the tapes.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.361
Where did I find it?

05:22.572 --> 05:23.904
It's embarrassing.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.573
I found it
behind that blue trash can.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.152
I'd had stuff stowed there
and I moved it out of the way,

05:29.371 --> 05:31.112
and there it was.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.913
So, in all,
there were four tapes

05:33.124 --> 05:35.207
and this is the first one.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.284
Ready?

05:38.547 --> 05:39.253
<i>Yes?</i>

05:39.464 --> 05:40.830
<i>This is Fleming Meeks
at Forbes.</i>

05:41.049 --> 05:43.336
<i>Oh, hello! Thank you so much
for the roses.</i>

05:43.552 --> 05:44.133
<i>You're very welcome.</i>

05:44.344 --> 05:46.836
<i>I love them!</i>

05:47.055 --> 05:48.591
<i>I'm very pleased.</i>

05:48.807 --> 05:50.139
I was a staff writer at <i>Forbes</i>

05:50.350 --> 05:54.185
and my father was
an astrophysicist at MIT,

05:54.396 --> 05:55.637
and he called me one day,
and he said,

05:55.856 --> 05:57.848
"I've just talked
with this friend of mine here

05:58.066 --> 05:59.352
and he told me
this amazing story

05:59.568 --> 06:03.278
about Hedy Lamarr,"
and, of course, I pursued it.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.196
<i>I want to sell my life story
to Ted Turner</i>

06:06.408 --> 06:08.195
<i>because it's unbelievable.</i>

06:08.410 --> 06:11.244
<i>The opposite
of what people think.</i>

06:11.454 --> 06:13.286
<i>The brains of people
are more interesting</i>

06:13.498 --> 06:16.161
<i>than the looks, I think.</i>

06:16.376 --> 06:19.619
<i>People have the idea
I'm sort of a stupid thing.</i>

06:19.838 --> 06:22.125
<i>I never knew I looked good
to begin with.</i>

06:22.340 --> 06:24.832
<i>Because my mother
wanted a boy</i>

06:25.051 --> 06:27.338
<i>named Georg (George).</i>

06:27.554 --> 06:30.012
<i>So unfortunately
I didn't become that and...</i>

06:30.223 --> 06:32.089
<i>she wasn't too thrilled
about that.</i>

06:34.477 --> 06:35.968
<i>I was...</i>

06:36.187 --> 06:37.268
<i>different, I guess.</i>

06:37.480 --> 06:39.813
<i>Maybe I came from
a different planet, who knows.</i>

06:41.443 --> 06:42.274
<i>But whatever it is...</i>

06:42.485 --> 06:44.898
<i>inventions are easy
for me to do.</i>

06:46.448 --> 06:48.906
My mother was very inventive.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.155
In this article,
"Hedy's interest in gadgets

06:52.370 --> 06:54.828
really started
at the age of five

06:55.040 --> 06:58.249
when she took
an old-fashioned music box apart

06:58.460 --> 07:00.827
and put it
back together again."

07:02.589 --> 07:06.458
And this was
her childhood music box.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.669
You wind up
this little rabbit here

07:09.888 --> 07:13.302
and it plays
an Austrian melody.

07:21.733 --> 07:22.974
My mother was curious.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.186
She had a very intellectually
curious mind.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.270
She wanted to know
how things worked,

07:28.490 --> 07:31.198
and her father told her things.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.243
Although her father's
official position

07:34.454 --> 07:36.161
was as bank director,

07:36.373 --> 07:40.492
he was also interested
in technology.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.212
So, when they went
for their walks,

07:45.423 --> 07:48.757
he would point out to her
how things worked.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.258
The streetcar
with its electric trolleys

07:52.472 --> 07:54.805
leads these wires
to a factory

07:55.016 --> 07:58.509
that generates electricity.

07:58.728 --> 08:02.312
She learned
to associate invention

08:02.524 --> 08:05.892
with this father,
whom she adored.

08:07.195 --> 08:07.935
<i>My father...</i>

08:08.154 --> 08:10.362
<i>He was a wonderful person.</i>

08:11.658 --> 08:12.990
<i>I miss him.</i>

08:17.372 --> 08:21.207
They lived in Vienna
in a fashionable district,

08:21.418 --> 08:23.205
the 19th District.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.536
It was heavily Jewish

08:24.754 --> 08:28.088
but also
very artistically inclined.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.541
Hedy's parents were both
assimilated Jews.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.798
That was very common in
the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

08:35.472 --> 08:39.136
They were wealthy,
they were cultured.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.140
They took their daughter
to the opera, to the theater.

08:43.356 --> 08:47.145
Everyone was connected with
this world of make believe.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.734
<i>I miss Austria.</i>

08:49.946 --> 08:51.107
<i>Have you ever been there?</i>

08:51.322 --> 08:52.403
<i>I've been to Austria, yes.</i>

08:52.615 --> 08:54.447
<i>Not Vienna?</i>

08:54.659 --> 08:56.742
<i>Fall is the best time
to go there.</i>

08:58.830 --> 09:00.116
<i>Where did you go to school?</i>

09:00.331 --> 09:01.993
<i>In a private school in Vienna.</i>

09:02.208 --> 09:05.542
<i>My favorite thing in school
was...</i>

09:05.754 --> 09:08.337
<i>What's that thing
when you mix things?</i>

09:08.548 --> 09:11.211
<i>- Chemistry.
- Chemistry! Thank you.</i>

09:11.426 --> 09:12.883
<i>Well I'm good at that.</i>

09:14.345 --> 09:15.461
In a different era,

09:15.680 --> 09:20.095
she might very well
have become a scientist.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.017
At the very least,
it's an option

09:22.228 --> 09:25.346
that was derailed by her beauty.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.646
By the time she was a teenager,

09:33.865 --> 09:37.199
when she walked into a room,
conversation stopped.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.993
She was probably
a little dazzled by this power,

09:43.208 --> 09:44.244
testing it out,

09:44.459 --> 09:46.200
seeing how it works
and so forth.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.916
<i>There's a word for what I was.</i>

09:50.131 --> 09:50.917
<i>A... what?</i>

09:51.132 --> 09:53.465
<i>'Enfant terrible.'</i>

09:53.676 --> 09:55.918
<i>I know that.
I know that much French.</i>

09:56.137 --> 09:57.173
<i>Well good!</i>

09:57.388 --> 10:01.132
There are stories about her
heading to the photographer

10:01.351 --> 10:05.641
to get her photos taken
with and without clothes.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.775
She lived in a society
where there were

10:11.986 --> 10:17.448
many prominent women who had
not only incredible careers,

10:17.659 --> 10:20.447
but loads of lovers.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.120
Women, especially in the arts,

10:23.331 --> 10:25.288
could have certain
kinds of liberties

10:25.500 --> 10:31.337
that they would not find
in normal bourgeois society.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.006
Hedy decided one day,
at the age of 16,

10:34.217 --> 10:36.083
that she was ready

10:36.302 --> 10:40.842
and went off to the largest
film studio and walked in.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.549
Very quickly,
within a couple days,

10:43.768 --> 10:45.600
they had her in a walk-on.

10:48.606 --> 10:52.475
I have seen
the little weird Viennese films

10:52.694 --> 10:54.151
that she made in the beginning

10:54.362 --> 10:56.524
where she's
a little bit awkward

10:56.739 --> 10:58.901
but clearly beautiful.

11:04.414 --> 11:08.124
But it's clearly
the 1933 film <i>Ecstasy</i>

11:08.334 --> 11:12.328
that really brought her
into everyone's consciousness.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.878
Hedy became world famous

11:17.093 --> 11:21.007
the moment she appeared naked
in <i>Ecstasy.</i>

11:24.726 --> 11:26.137
The Pope denounced it

11:26.352 --> 11:29.891
and Hitler refused it
to be shown.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.599
People were just shocked by it.

11:33.818 --> 11:37.402
It was quite controversial
because she simulated an orgasm.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.901
I think it was the first time
anybody had ever done that.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.318
I mean, in some ways,
it was analogous to a sex tape.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.326
This was so scandalous
and really marked her

11:48.541 --> 11:49.952
as this certain type of woman.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.211
<i>I don't know
if you ever saw that.</i>

11:54.422 --> 11:56.459
<i>I don't believe I have.</i>

11:56.674 --> 12:00.634
<i>There was a scene
in which I was totally alone</i>

12:00.845 --> 12:03.337
<i>but it was cut so that it</i>

12:03.556 --> 12:06.173
<i>showed that it was
a very hot sex scene,</i>

12:06.392 --> 12:07.348
<i>which it wasn't.</i>

12:07.560 --> 12:08.971
<i>You must have seen
a picture of that, right?</i>

12:09.187 --> 12:10.223
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

12:10.438 --> 12:13.397
<i>And I said, "Why do I have
to put my arms together?"</i>

12:13.608 --> 12:15.600
<i>And they said,
"Don't ask so many questions."</i>

12:15.818 --> 12:18.231
<i>"If you don't do what I say
then I put the needle</i>

12:18.446 --> 12:21.314
<i>through the couch
so you do what I tell you."</i>

12:21.532 --> 12:22.318
<i>And I was...</i>

12:22.533 --> 12:26.447
<i>I didn't want to make any
commotion, so I did that.</i>

12:26.663 --> 12:28.780
<i>And when I came back to Vienna</i>

12:28.998 --> 12:30.239
<i>my father... I mean...</i>

12:30.458 --> 12:32.074
<i>it was horrendous.</i>

12:32.293 --> 12:35.957
<i>He wanted to kill me
practically.</i>

12:36.172 --> 12:37.333
<i>What I did though...</i>

12:37.548 --> 12:38.413
<i>right after that</i>

12:38.633 --> 12:40.374
<i>I said, "I'll show them."</i>

12:43.012 --> 12:45.299
<i>Fritz Kreisler
composed a musical called</i>

12:45.515 --> 12:48.303
<i>'Elisabeth of Austria, '
the Queen of Austria,</i>

12:48.518 --> 12:51.807
<i>and I had a big, big, big
success with that.</i>

12:52.021 --> 12:54.809
<i>On stage.</i>

12:55.024 --> 12:56.390
<i>I had ovations</i>

12:56.609 --> 12:58.646
<i>and my father cried.</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:06.325
<i>And then I got married
right after that.</i>

13:06.536 --> 13:08.368
Hedwig, as an actress,

13:08.579 --> 13:11.868
drew, of course,
the attention of many people,

13:12.083 --> 13:17.295
and one of those was
a man named Fritz Mandl.

13:17.505 --> 13:21.215
I was married to
a munitions tycoon in Austria!

13:22.343 --> 13:25.632
He is the Henry Ford of Austria.

13:25.847 --> 13:30.262
He, at that point,
is 14 years her senior.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.093
He is allied with the Nazis

13:33.313 --> 13:36.351
because he's
an armaments manufacturer.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.933
As it is the same today,

13:39.152 --> 13:43.237
a lot of wealthy men would like
to decorate themselves

13:43.448 --> 13:45.280
with beautiful women,
and I think she was,

13:45.491 --> 13:48.154
for a minute,
fascinated with that as well.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.789
<i>We had a country house
with 25 guest rooms.</i>

13:55.001 --> 13:56.367
<i>And we went hunting.</i>

13:56.586 --> 13:59.169
<i>And I loved that.</i>

13:59.380 --> 14:00.837
<i>Do you know guns?</i>

14:01.049 --> 14:01.914
<i>Yes.</i>

14:02.133 --> 14:06.093
<i>I had a Browning
and I shot a stag into the neck</i>

14:06.304 --> 14:08.091
<i>350 meters.</i>

14:08.306 --> 14:09.262
<i>Meters? Very long.</i>

14:09.474 --> 14:11.466
<i>I'm a good shot
so be careful!</i>

14:13.561 --> 14:17.180
Hedy was Mandl's armpiece

14:17.398 --> 14:19.310
at the banquets that he served

14:19.525 --> 14:23.109
for admirals
in the German and Italian Navy.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.064
She sat there and it was
her job to be beautiful,

14:26.282 --> 14:29.070
but she was bored
out of her mind.

14:32.747 --> 14:36.787
Fritz Mandl was,
by German measures, Jewish,

14:37.001 --> 14:39.163
and therefore,
Hitler was concerned

14:39.379 --> 14:40.335
not to be seen with him,

14:40.546 --> 14:43.038
and I doubt very much
if Hitler was a guest

14:43.257 --> 14:46.091
at one of their houses,
but Mussolini was.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.846
<i>I assume that
your first husband</i>

14:52.058 --> 14:53.594
<i>was supplying arms to the...</i>

14:53.810 --> 14:56.223
<i>To the Germans.</i>

14:56.437 --> 14:57.223
<i>But he never let me in on...</i>

14:57.438 --> 15:00.647
<i>He never even let me
come into the factory.</i>

15:00.858 --> 15:01.848
<i>I disturbed the people.</i>

15:02.068 --> 15:03.184
<i>I didn't know why...</i>

15:04.904 --> 15:06.520
Fritz did not like the effect

15:06.739 --> 15:10.232
that his beautiful wife had
on other men.

15:10.451 --> 15:15.196
He was immensely jealous
and paranoid about his wife.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.415
He was constantly convinced

15:18.626 --> 15:22.210
that she might be having
an affair.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.914
<i>The big mistake
my husband at the time did</i>

15:25.133 --> 15:27.466
<i>he bought up prints of that...</i>

15:27.677 --> 15:29.543
<i>dumb picture!</i>

15:29.762 --> 15:32.254
Mandl had the problem
of this film,

15:32.473 --> 15:36.012
this dirty picture
which he tried to buy up,

15:36.227 --> 15:39.095
and they started cranking
them out by the dozens,

15:39.313 --> 15:42.272
and he eventually gave up
because, obviously,

15:42.483 --> 15:45.442
they could make as many copies
as he chose to buy.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.405
He turned out to be someone
who had the maids listen in

15:50.616 --> 15:52.152
on her phone calls.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.576
She had everything
she could ever want,

15:54.787 --> 15:58.997
except the one thing that
Hedwig Kiesler always wanted

15:59.208 --> 16:00.619
which was freedom.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.841
By 1937,
the war was inevitable,

16:09.051 --> 16:11.293
and she was
in a desperate situation.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.719
<i>Because after all,</i>

16:12.930 --> 16:15.923
<i>Hitler had everything
in the palm of his hand.</i>

16:16.142 --> 16:18.099
When <i>Ecstasy</i> was released,

16:18.311 --> 16:21.930
Hitler told the American press
he was banning it

16:22.148 --> 16:25.061
because the lead actress
was Jewish.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.107
Jewish people were not allowed
out on streets

16:33.326 --> 16:36.194
at certain times of the day
and, gradually,

16:36.412 --> 16:40.281
they were denied
more and more civil rights.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.832
And this is one thing that led

16:42.043 --> 16:46.629
to Hedy's father Emil's death
was his stress and worry

16:46.839 --> 16:49.923
about what was happening.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.217
He died suddenly
from a heart attack.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.421
And I think that was
the turning point for her.

16:57.892 --> 17:01.511
Deep traumatic experiences
change us,

17:01.729 --> 17:03.641
and she came out the other side

17:03.856 --> 17:08.351
remembering what her father
had advised her from childhood:

17:08.569 --> 17:10.185
"Be yourself.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.817
Choose and take what you want,"

17:13.031 --> 17:16.195
which was certainly
Hedy's quality all her life.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.362
There are stories,

17:20.580 --> 17:22.038
whether they're apocryphal
or not,

17:22.250 --> 17:25.163
who knows, but almost like
a prison escape.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.170
Hedy had people watching her
all the time.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.089
There was no way
to break loose.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.134
So, one night,
they were having a dinner party,

17:34.345 --> 17:37.884
and my mother
helped choose the maids

17:38.099 --> 17:40.967
and caretakers,
and so she found someone

17:41.185 --> 17:44.223
that looked like her a lot
'cause she had this in mind.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.304
So, she had
this sleeping powder,

17:46.524 --> 17:47.890
and she made this tea

17:48.109 --> 17:51.819
and she switched the cups
with the maid,

17:52.029 --> 17:53.770
and the maid drank it
and kind of fell asleep.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.106
Now my mother's all ready.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.565
She took all her jewels,

17:56.784 --> 17:58.275
put 'em in the lining
of her coats.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.951
She put on the maid's costume.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.700
She jumped on her bicycle
and rode off.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.703
<i>My parents had friends
in England.</i>

18:09.922 --> 18:11.629
<i>So I went there.</i>

18:14.385 --> 18:16.843
Pre-war London
was a safe haven.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.966
Hedy spent several months there

18:19.181 --> 18:21.514
trying to figure out
her next steps.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.468
<i>We one day went to a movie.</i>

18:24.687 --> 18:27.145
<i>I forgot even what it was.</i>

18:27.356 --> 18:29.973
<i>And they happened
to have a lion.</i>

18:30.192 --> 18:33.276
<i>You know, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.</i>

18:33.487 --> 18:35.524
<i>So I said,
"Oh I want to be in that!"</i>

18:36.991 --> 18:40.530
She quickly found
an American film agent.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.279
<i>Somebody took me to a hotel</i>

18:44.498 --> 18:46.740
<i>and there was
a little man there.</i>

18:46.959 --> 18:48.370
<i>I didn't know who he was,
what he was.</i>

18:48.586 --> 18:50.703
<i>I couldn't speak English,
obviously.</i>

18:50.921 --> 18:52.287
<i>Louis B. Mayer
was the little man.</i>

18:52.506 --> 18:53.121
<i>That was Louis B. Mayer?</i>

18:53.341 --> 18:55.173
<i>With his entourage, yeah.</i>

18:56.510 --> 18:58.297
Louis B. Mayer,
of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,

18:58.512 --> 19:02.347
had come to Europe to buy up
all the actors and actresses

19:02.558 --> 19:04.675
who were escaping Nazi Germany.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.261
He figured he could take them
back to Hollywood

19:07.480 --> 19:11.645
and enslave them in
his Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer empire

19:11.859 --> 19:14.021
for a cheap price.

19:14.236 --> 19:18.697
He offered her $125 a week
and reminded her

19:18.908 --> 19:21.696
that she had to keep
her clothes on.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.278
And she said, "I'm sorry,
that's not good enough,"

19:24.497 --> 19:25.783
and walked out.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.489
She impressed him, I'm sure.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.951
People didn't usually turn down
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.295
But minutes
after she walked out,

19:34.507 --> 19:35.793
she had second thoughts

19:36.008 --> 19:38.842
and quickly booked passage
on the Normandie,

19:39.053 --> 19:42.171
the ship Mayer was sailing
back to New York.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.133
She, I think,
probably rather cleverly

19:47.353 --> 19:50.266
made sure that she saw him
about the decks

19:50.481 --> 19:52.063
in her tennis clothes
and so forth,

19:52.274 --> 19:53.390
in her bathing suit.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.320
On the first
or second night out,

19:58.531 --> 20:02.024
Hedy went
to her very modest cabin

20:02.243 --> 20:06.283
and pulled out
her designer couturier gown

20:06.497 --> 20:10.411
and she put on
the last baubles that she owned

20:10.626 --> 20:12.743
and she walked
through the dining room

20:12.962 --> 20:16.797
of the Normandie,
past Louis B. Mayer's table.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.466
There's Douglas Fairbanks Jr.
sitting right there,

20:23.681 --> 20:27.140
and his eyes are glued
to Hedy Lamarr,

20:27.351 --> 20:30.014
as are the eyes
of every man and woman

20:30.229 --> 20:32.562
in that dining room.

20:32.773 --> 20:36.312
And Louis B. Mayer knew
he had to have her.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.768
<i>He snapped his fingers</i>

20:37.987 --> 20:40.445
<i>and I didn't know why,
I didn't know what...</i>

20:40.656 --> 20:44.445
<i>all of a sudden
I got $500 every week.</i>

20:44.660 --> 20:47.198
Hedy Kiesler,
Hedy Kiesler, Kiesler.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.530
We gotta do something
about the name.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.617
So, Louis B. Mayer's wife
was there and she said,

20:52.835 --> 20:54.747
"Well, Barbara La Marr
is one of my favorites.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.669
Why not Hedy Lamarr?"

20:56.881 --> 20:58.167
Lamarr, the sea, perfect.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.589
Let's be Hedy Lamarr.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.211
She didn't speak
a word of English.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.138
She learned those few lines
on the boat to convince

21:07.349 --> 21:09.636
Louis B. Mayer that he should
hire her as an actress.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.932
She created her own reality,

21:13.147 --> 21:14.638
and I find that
really fascinating.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.607
<i>You know, when things
don't come easy</i>

21:18.819 --> 21:20.230
<i>figure out why...</i>

21:20.446 --> 21:23.063
<i>and then do something about it.</i>

21:23.282 --> 21:25.649
<i>And if people...
walk over you</i>

21:25.868 --> 21:27.404
<i>then don't let them!</i>

21:29.497 --> 21:31.363
She stepped off
the ship in New York

21:31.582 --> 21:34.120
to crowds
of flashing light bulbs

21:34.335 --> 21:39.126
and reporters firing questions
at her as Hedy Lamarr,

21:39.340 --> 21:42.128
the latest discovery
of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.639
Hello, everybody,

21:50.851 --> 21:52.808
this is Hedda Hopper
reporting to you from Hollywood,

21:53.020 --> 21:55.478
that fabulous place
where everyone wants to live

21:55.689 --> 21:56.725
but seldom does.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.937
In Hollywood,
she was kicking her heels

22:04.156 --> 22:07.115
and listening to music
and being free.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.161
She was a little bit worried
because the contract,

22:12.373 --> 22:14.990
it had kind of a trial time
before they used her,

22:15.209 --> 22:17.292
and she wasn't getting
any movies or parts

22:17.503 --> 22:20.996
and she was very insecure
that they didn't want her,

22:21.215 --> 22:22.547
especially since
she made <i>Ecstasy</i>

22:22.758 --> 22:26.342
and that was kind of
a black mark on her.

22:26.554 --> 22:29.012
Right from the beginning,
one of her first interviews

22:29.223 --> 22:32.136
is with Hedda Hopper, who was
the famous gossip columnist.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.388
That's where she does
her greatest acting

22:34.603 --> 22:37.220
is for Hedda Hopper,
crying tears

22:37.439 --> 22:39.476
about how she was forced
into this nude scene

22:39.692 --> 22:43.185
and somehow perverted
by these European filmmakers

22:43.404 --> 22:46.272
who have no morals whatsoever.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.992
And then,
my mother went to a party

22:52.204 --> 22:55.743
by chance one night,
and Charles Boyer was there

22:55.958 --> 22:57.540
and he was smitten by her.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.789
And he said,
"Can you be in my movie?"

23:01.005 --> 23:04.339
"Oh, no, no, no, my English
isn't good enough, no."

23:04.550 --> 23:07.258
And he took her hand, kissed it,
he said, "I'll hold your hand

23:07.469 --> 23:08.926
through the whole film."

23:09.138 --> 23:10.219
- "You will?"
- "Yes."

23:10.431 --> 23:11.763
"All right, I'll do it."

23:11.974 --> 23:13.340
So, that's how that started.

23:19.315 --> 23:22.524
Charles Boyer
was a diamond thief.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.852
She had diamonds.

23:25.070 --> 23:30.111
He thought she was a wealthy,
noble-born French woman.

23:30.326 --> 23:33.160
He didn't realize that she was
another scamp like him

23:33.370 --> 23:34.702
from the streets of Paris.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.745
There's a wonderful line
in the film where he says,

23:39.960 --> 23:41.496
"What did you do before?"

23:41.712 --> 23:43.920
Before what?

23:44.131 --> 23:45.793
Before the jewels.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.341
I wanted them.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.384
That film made her
a star instantly.

23:53.474 --> 23:57.013
When I was a kid,
I saw her in <i>Algiers,</i>

23:57.227 --> 23:59.219
I said,
"I'm gonna get to Hollywood

23:59.438 --> 24:01.350
and I'm gonna marry her.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.227
And if I don't get to marry her,

24:03.442 --> 24:04.432
I'll get to buy her dinner

24:04.652 --> 24:06.063
and feel her up under the table.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.143
Whatever I can get."

24:10.366 --> 24:14.280
After <i>Algiers,</i>
Hedy Lamarr was on the cover

24:14.495 --> 24:16.157
of all the movie magazines.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.706
Suddenly,
you have in Hollywood,

24:19.917 --> 24:23.501
a lot of women parting
their hair in the middle,

24:23.712 --> 24:26.125
darkening it,
and changing their makeup

24:26.340 --> 24:29.799
to be little Hedy Lamarrs.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.002
Every woman wanted to be Hedy

24:32.221 --> 24:34.258
and every man
wanted to date her.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.261
She seduced men and women.

24:37.476 --> 24:41.015
She was able to meet
artists, directors,

24:41.230 --> 24:44.439
brilliant actors,
the greats at that time.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.227
<i>Including Kennedy,
whom I knew very well.</i>

24:48.445 --> 24:49.185
<i>Oh really?</i>

24:49.405 --> 24:51.362
<i>Yeah,
before he became president.</i>

24:51.573 --> 24:53.109
<i>He asked me out.</i>

24:53.325 --> 24:55.442
<i>So he said,
"What can I bring you?"</i>

24:55.661 --> 24:57.823
<i>and I said, "Oranges,"
because...</i>

24:58.038 --> 25:01.031
<i>I lack vitamin C.</i>

25:01.250 --> 25:02.457
<i>Would you believe
any other person</i>

25:02.668 --> 25:05.001
<i>would've asked, "Oranges"?</i>

25:05.212 --> 25:06.293
<i>That's the way I am.</i>

25:06.505 --> 25:08.167
<i>A fool!</i>

25:08.382 --> 25:10.294
No matter what,
you expect Hedy Lamarr

25:10.509 --> 25:13.377
to be glamorous, sophisticated.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.552
Quite the opposite,
she loved picnics,

25:15.764 --> 25:17.926
she loved to go
scavenger hunting,

25:18.142 --> 25:19.633
she loved to play Charades.

25:19.852 --> 25:24.142
She wasn't very good at it,
but she had a great time.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.097
You know, no pretenses.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.273
She was fun to be with.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.145
At that point,
she could have married anyone.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.821
She surprised her fans

25:34.033 --> 25:36.320
by choosing
a portly screenwriter

25:36.535 --> 25:39.619
and producer
named Gene Markey.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.624
Her letters show she was
madly in love with him.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.794
<i>"Dearest Mommy,
I never would have thought</i>

25:49.006 --> 25:51.669
<i>that I could ever fall
in love again.</i>

25:51.884 --> 25:54.171
<i>Gene has an unbelievable number
of traits</i>

25:54.386 --> 25:56.218
<i>in common with Dad.</i>

25:56.430 --> 25:59.639
<i>So considerate, it's touching."</i>

25:59.850 --> 26:03.093
He promised Hedy he'd write
screenplays with her.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.679
They even adopted a son.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.015
But within months
of their marriage,

26:08.233 --> 26:11.897
he began dating
other beautiful actresses.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.104
Hedy was heartbroken.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.657
She said people
never got past her face.

26:17.868 --> 26:20.201
You never knew
if they loved you

26:20.412 --> 26:23.155
or their fantasy of you.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.911
"A man does not try
to find out what is inside.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.584
He does not try
to scratch the surface.

26:28.796 --> 26:31.288
If he did, he might find
something much more beautiful

26:31.507 --> 26:34.591
than the shape of a nose
or the color of an eye."

26:37.888 --> 26:39.754
Only a year after <i>Algiers,</i>

26:39.973 --> 26:42.215
not only was
her marriage failing,

26:42.434 --> 26:45.427
her career was in trouble
as well.

26:45.646 --> 26:48.935
She was terribly unhappy
with the films she did for MGM

26:49.149 --> 26:51.687
because Louis B. Mayer
gave her bad scripts

26:51.902 --> 26:54.269
and the films did nothing.

26:54.488 --> 26:56.354
You never got very much
out of this, did you?

26:56.573 --> 26:57.654
I got plenty.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.734
All I asked for,
except the frosting.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.569
<i>Hedy actually went
to Louis B. Mayer</i>

27:02.788 --> 27:05.747
<i>and petitioned for a role
in Boom Town.</i>

27:05.958 --> 27:07.870
I'm going to do it
because I want to.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.246
<i>It was a small part,</i>

27:09.461 --> 27:12.545
<i>and Louis B. Mayer,
at first, was reluctant.</i>

27:12.756 --> 27:13.917
Okay, stranger.

27:17.219 --> 27:20.303
<i>Boom Town</i> was a huge,
tremendous success

27:20.514 --> 27:22.096
for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.093
After <i>Boom Town,</i>

27:23.308 --> 27:27.052
Hedy Lamarr's career was secure.

27:27.271 --> 27:32.107
It's almost unfathomable
how busy she was in 1940.

27:35.279 --> 27:39.148
They were expected to do
what the studio wanted.

27:39.366 --> 27:42.325
Bette Davis described it
as a "slave system."

27:42.536 --> 27:44.152
And they were owned
in the sense

27:44.371 --> 27:47.114
that they had signed contracts

27:47.332 --> 27:51.451
that bound them to studios
for seven-year periods.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.332
My mother was worked
like a racehorse.

27:53.547 --> 27:56.164
She had to run fast
all the time.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.375
They gave her pills
to wake her up to perform.

27:58.594 --> 28:01.678
Pretty sure it was
some form of speed.

28:01.889 --> 28:05.303
And then, to make them sleep,
they gave them sleeping pills.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.477
They worked six days a week.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.271
Women really had to get
to the studio early

28:12.482 --> 28:14.974
because they had to have
their hair done,

28:15.194 --> 28:18.437
their makeup put on,
their costumes put on.

28:18.655 --> 28:22.274
And then, you know,
they worked into the night.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.404
And here's what's remarkable.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.907
After a grueling day
on the set,

28:27.122 --> 28:28.829
Hedy didn't go to bed.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.828
She wasn't socializing.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.286
Hedy was at home working
on her latest invention.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.168
Inventing was her hobby.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.845
She not only had
a complete inventing table

28:45.057 --> 28:46.844
set up in her house,

28:47.059 --> 28:50.928
but Howard Hughes gave her
a small version

28:51.146 --> 28:53.638
of the set of equipment
which he had in the trailer

28:53.857 --> 28:56.190
where she stayed
in between takes

28:56.401 --> 28:57.767
in her motion pictures.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.480
When Hedy first met
Howard Hughes,

29:01.698 --> 29:04.065
he was dating
every Hollywood star,

29:04.284 --> 29:06.321
and she did date him.

29:06.536 --> 29:10.200
Howard Hughes, of course,
was a great airplane designer,

29:10.415 --> 29:12.281
so probably they had

29:12.501 --> 29:15.585
a compatible spirit
with one another.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.504
It was definitely cerebral
because she said

29:18.715 --> 29:21.332
he was the worst lover
she ever had.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.255
Howard Hughes wanted to build

29:24.471 --> 29:26.713
the fastest planes
in the world

29:26.932 --> 29:29.640
so he could sell them
to the Air Force.

29:29.851 --> 29:33.686
She was fascinated by his mind
and his factories,

29:33.897 --> 29:35.980
and she wanted to go and see

29:36.191 --> 29:37.602
where everything
was being made and built,

29:37.818 --> 29:39.480
and she met all the scientists.

29:39.695 --> 29:40.936
He said to her,

29:41.154 --> 29:43.396
"Anything you want my scientists
to do for you,

29:43.615 --> 29:46.278
just ask 'em
and they will do it."

29:48.453 --> 29:50.035
<i>He relied on me.</i>

29:50.247 --> 29:53.081
<i>I thought the aeroplanes
were too slow,</i>

29:53.292 --> 29:55.124
<i>so I decided that's not right.</i>

29:55.335 --> 29:58.294
<i>They shouldn't be square,
the wings...</i>

29:58.505 --> 30:00.292
<i>So I bought a book of fish</i>

30:00.507 --> 30:02.169
<i>and I bought a book of birds</i>

30:02.384 --> 30:04.341
<i>and then used the fastest bird,</i>

30:04.553 --> 30:07.136
<i>connected it with
the fastest fish.</i>

30:07.347 --> 30:09.464
<i>I drew it together
and showed it to Howard Hughes</i>

30:09.683 --> 30:11.925
<i>and he said,
"You're a genius."</i>

30:12.144 --> 30:13.180
<i>- You did?
- Yep.</i>

30:15.522 --> 30:16.353
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:20.402 --> 30:21.938
<i>Very strange person that was.</i>

30:22.154 --> 30:23.315
<i>Very brilliant.</i>

30:23.530 --> 30:25.897
<i>But very misunderstood as well.</i>

30:27.451 --> 30:30.694
She invented,
during that period,

30:30.912 --> 30:34.952
a tablet that would fizz up
and make a cola.

30:35.167 --> 30:39.127
<i>I had two chemists Howard
Hughes gave me to do that.</i>

30:39.338 --> 30:41.330
<i>You know, during the war
nobody had Coca-Cola</i>

30:41.548 --> 30:44.712
<i>and I wanted to compress it
into a cube</i>

30:44.926 --> 30:48.260
<i>so that servicemen
and factory people,</i>

30:48.472 --> 30:52.716
<i>all they had to
have was water and put it in.</i>

30:52.934 --> 30:55.142
<i>But I didn't realize
that every state</i>

30:55.354 --> 30:58.438
<i>has different
strengths of water,</i>

30:58.648 --> 31:01.265
<i>so it dissolved on the bottom,
on top, in the middle.</i>

31:01.485 --> 31:03.101
<i>It was one of my boo boos.</i>

31:03.320 --> 31:05.403
<i>I didn't do that right.</i>

31:05.614 --> 31:08.197
<i>But I don't have to work
on ideas.</i>

31:08.408 --> 31:09.865
<i>They come naturally.</i>

31:12.412 --> 31:14.495
What must have been going
through the mind

31:14.706 --> 31:16.322
of this young woman.

31:16.541 --> 31:21.286
She's become
a huge international film star.

31:21.505 --> 31:24.088
But at the very same time,
her country,

31:24.299 --> 31:28.168
the past as she has known it,
has been eliminated.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.093
In 1940,
the war was raging in Europe

31:33.308 --> 31:36.221
and the United States
was a neutral country,

31:36.436 --> 31:38.143
and Hitler
was basically taking over

31:38.355 --> 31:40.017
all of Western Europe

31:40.232 --> 31:42.599
and threatening
to take over Great Britain.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.229
If only I could do something.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.606
Oh, darling,
you've done so much already.

31:46.822 --> 31:50.987
You almost made me forget
about being afraid.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.614
Oh, I am afraid now.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.405
She did have a secret.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.207
When Hedy arrived
at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,

32:00.419 --> 32:04.459
Louis B. Mayer specifically
ordered all of his stars

32:04.673 --> 32:08.087
not to talk about
their religious backgrounds.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.917
People would say,
"You're Jewish,"

32:10.137 --> 32:13.005
and I'm like, "No,"
and I called Mom and said,

32:13.223 --> 32:14.885
"Mom, are we Jewish,"
and she said,

32:15.100 --> 32:17.217
"Don't be ridiculous."

32:19.312 --> 32:23.727
I never heard the word "Jewish"
from my mother's lips.

32:23.942 --> 32:28.403
The Jewish part of her,
she just left behind.

32:30.407 --> 32:34.742
She was probably afraid
for many reasons.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.615
And I could feel it,

32:36.830 --> 32:40.073
I could see that
she was protecting herself.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.246
I became a manicurist.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.294
That's how I met Hedy.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.711
I told her that I survived
the war with camps

32:49.926 --> 32:52.259
and running for my life.

32:53.722 --> 32:56.590
We talked about
what was going on

32:56.808 --> 32:59.596
and how I come to America.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.023
I find myself
on an American ship.

33:05.233 --> 33:09.398
I was shaking with fear
because we heard noises.

33:11.031 --> 33:14.274
We were attacked
by the Nazi submarines.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.445
I remember saying,
"Oh, dear God,

33:18.663 --> 33:23.283
please don't kill me now,
let me see America."

33:25.712 --> 33:28.204
At the time,
Hedy's mother was preparing

33:28.423 --> 33:31.712
to make the treacherous
Atlantic crossing herself.

33:31.927 --> 33:35.386
She'd fled Austria
and gotten as far as London

33:35.597 --> 33:39.181
where she and Hedy
were able to write each other.

33:39.392 --> 33:42.476
<i>"Mommy, my mind
is so preoccupied</i>

33:42.687 --> 33:45.395
<i>and I would love it
if you could come immediately</i>

33:45.607 --> 33:47.564
<i>since the times,
they are very uncertain.</i>

33:49.694 --> 33:51.777
<i>I have been listening
to the radio day and night</i>

33:51.988 --> 33:53.274
<i>for over a week,</i>

33:53.490 --> 33:55.152
<i>and I've gotten
barely any sleep."</i>

33:55.367 --> 33:56.483
<i>Vivid pictures
of a naval action</i>

33:56.701 --> 33:58.112
<i>have just been released.</i>

33:58.328 --> 34:01.366
One day,
in the summer of 1940,

34:01.581 --> 34:04.324
a shipload of children
was torpedoed.

34:04.543 --> 34:08.411
All hands lost
including 83 children.

34:12.007 --> 34:13.373
At the time,
the German U-boats

34:13.592 --> 34:17.257
were on the verge
of winning the war.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.088
They seemed to be unsinkable

34:19.306 --> 34:21.219
because they easily
outmaneuvered

34:21.434 --> 34:25.178
the outdated British torpedoes.

34:25.397 --> 34:30.188
In times of crisis,
most of us feel powerless,

34:30.402 --> 34:32.485
but a few discover
in themselves

34:32.696 --> 34:35.154
unexpected strength.

34:35.364 --> 34:38.027
And Hedy being Hedy,
she said,

34:38.243 --> 34:41.202
"I'm gonna do something
about that."

34:41.413 --> 34:43.951
So, in this article, Hedy says,

34:44.165 --> 34:46.157
"I got the idea
for my invention

34:46.376 --> 34:48.708
when I tried to think
of some way

34:48.920 --> 34:51.128
to even the balance
for the British.

34:51.339 --> 34:56.208
A radio-controlled torpedo
I thought would do it."

34:56.428 --> 34:59.387
A torpedo launched
on a given trajectory

34:59.598 --> 35:02.557
might need to be changed,
redirected.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.259
You want, ideally,
your launching boat

35:05.478 --> 35:08.767
to communicate
with the torpedo.

35:08.982 --> 35:13.067
The problem is you can't control
radio communications.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.144
They're not secure.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.821
Your enemy, if they're smart,

35:18.033 --> 35:21.071
finds the frequency with which
you're talking to the torpedo

35:21.286 --> 35:22.117
and jams it.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.580
<i>Jamming.</i>

35:26.791 --> 35:30.080
<i>The Germans fill the air
with radio interference.</i>

35:30.295 --> 35:32.207
She came up with the idea
of a secret way

35:32.422 --> 35:34.163
of guiding that torpedo
to the target

35:34.382 --> 35:37.375
that couldn't be interrupted,
that couldn't be jammed,

35:37.594 --> 35:38.960
that couldn't be messed with.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.169
It was secret.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.887
Instead of just one transmit
frequency communicating,

35:45.101 --> 35:47.764
she said, "What if we changed
those frequencies constantly

35:47.979 --> 35:49.891
in sync with each other?"

35:50.106 --> 35:52.940
Frequency hopping.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.858
You couldn't jam it
because you'd only jam

35:55.070 --> 35:58.154
a split second of it
in a single frequency.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.607
So, frequency change,
frequency hop,

36:00.825 --> 36:02.157
frequency hop, frequency hop.

36:02.369 --> 36:05.737
That concept,
secure radio communications,

36:05.955 --> 36:07.617
was brilliant.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.667
Now there are various versions
of how she came up

36:11.878 --> 36:15.872
with her profoundly
original idea.

36:16.091 --> 36:19.175
One theory is
that she stole it.

36:19.386 --> 36:22.379
The man who championed
that idea was an engineer

36:22.597 --> 36:25.840
who once interviewed her
named Robert Price.

36:26.059 --> 36:29.268
Robert Price was a pioneer
in secret communications,

36:29.479 --> 36:32.017
and he gave me his number
and I called him up.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.181
<i>She's an inventor</i>

36:34.401 --> 36:38.941
<i>but I don't know in what sense
exactly she is an inventor.</i>

36:39.155 --> 36:39.861
<i>If I want to be harsh</i>

36:40.073 --> 36:43.532
<i>I would say she was
a plagiarizer, you understand?</i>

36:43.743 --> 36:44.779
Hedy's first husband

36:44.994 --> 36:48.487
was Austria's leading
munitions manufacturer.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.620
Robert Price said to me
that he thought

36:51.835 --> 36:54.828
that she just smuggled the idea
out of her husband's board room.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.835
In fact, he called her
the Mata Hari of World War Il,

36:59.050 --> 37:02.339
the most notorious spy
who seduced men

37:02.554 --> 37:05.046
and got all kinds of secrets
out of them.

37:05.265 --> 37:08.258
The engineers at Mandl's firm
might just have known

37:08.476 --> 37:10.308
about the frequency hopping.

37:12.313 --> 37:15.772
<i>Is that how you were aware
of frequency hopping?</i>

37:15.984 --> 37:18.442
<i>No. What, my husband?</i>

37:18.653 --> 37:23.193
<i>No. Nobody did that...
invent that before.</i>

37:23.408 --> 37:25.274
<i>I mean, I know what I did.</i>

37:25.493 --> 37:27.860
<i>I don't care
what other people say about me.</i>

37:29.998 --> 37:31.705
The record is very clear

37:31.916 --> 37:36.752
that the Germans
had not come across the idea

37:36.963 --> 37:39.751
that would be
Hedy's signal contribution,

37:39.966 --> 37:43.084
what she called
"frequency hopping."

37:43.303 --> 37:46.216
I don't think she was a spy.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.390
<i>It was so obvious.
I mean they shot torpedoes</i>

37:49.601 --> 37:52.218
<i>in all directions
and never hit the target,</i>

37:52.437 --> 37:55.805
<i>so I invented
something that does.</i>

37:56.024 --> 37:59.108
<i>I mean, I can't explain.
I have an inventive mind.</i>

38:02.405 --> 38:06.399
I think Hedy got her idea
from a curious coincidence

38:06.618 --> 38:09.531
that, in 1939,

38:09.746 --> 38:12.238
the Philco Radio Company
produced

38:12.457 --> 38:14.995
a new top-of-the-line
remote control.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.997
There's a new gadget
just out, see?

38:17.212 --> 38:20.705
You dial your station here
and you hear it over there.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.586
- Well, where are the wires?
- There ain't any wires.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.337
That's the trick.

38:24.552 --> 38:28.171
We know Hedy was interested
in the remote control

38:28.389 --> 38:31.382
and how it worked
because the device is sketched

38:31.601 --> 38:33.968
in the invention notebooks.

38:36.105 --> 38:40.065
In here is all the evidence
of my mother's invention.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.142
It's this.

38:42.362 --> 38:45.105
She dialed in a radio station
and she said,

38:45.323 --> 38:48.532
"If we hop around frequencies,
just like I'm hopping

38:48.743 --> 38:52.953
around radio stations
on this dialer,

38:53.164 --> 38:56.874
when I transmit this information
to the torpedo,

38:57.085 --> 38:59.168
we can make it totally secret."

39:01.965 --> 39:04.298
So the Philco magic box
probably inspired

39:04.509 --> 39:06.091
the whole thing.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.765
The fact that she understands
this frequency component

39:12.976 --> 39:16.310
of the signal
and how that changes

39:16.521 --> 39:20.185
is, I mean, genius in a way.

39:22.110 --> 39:25.274
I mean, we know Thomas Edison
was not an engineer.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.571
You don't have to have
eight years

39:27.782 --> 39:29.774
of a graduate degree
in engineering

39:29.993 --> 39:33.031
in order to come up
with something new.

39:33.246 --> 39:35.613
In the inventing process,
there is a moment

39:35.832 --> 39:39.701
of high lucidity,
of clear thinking.

39:39.919 --> 39:43.458
In the case of Hedy,
she had this lucid moment

39:43.673 --> 39:46.507
without knowing how she was
going to put it together.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.836
She didn't have the training
to make it happen.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.920
And she said that,
"The idea was mine,

39:52.140 --> 39:55.224
but the implementation
was George's."

39:55.435 --> 39:59.224
My mother met George Antheil
at Janet Gaynor's party.

39:59.439 --> 40:02.477
And she liked
George Antheil a lot.

40:02.692 --> 40:04.479
So, when she left
the party early,

40:04.694 --> 40:06.310
she wrote her phone number
in lipstick

40:06.529 --> 40:09.567
on the windshield of his car.

40:09.782 --> 40:13.776
They discovered that they had
a great deal in common.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.282
At the time,
I think they both felt

40:16.497 --> 40:20.036
like they were not understood
for their true qualities.

40:20.251 --> 40:24.621
George Antheil was really quite
an unusual American composer,

40:24.839 --> 40:26.626
extremely avant-garde.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.879
Now musicians all over the world
love to play Antheil's music,

40:30.094 --> 40:32.586
they love to get
into that confrontational space

40:32.805 --> 40:33.795
that was his.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.506
He had a gun,
then he would pull it out

40:35.725 --> 40:37.887
and he'd bang it
down on the piano

40:38.102 --> 40:39.263
right at the beginning
of the show,

40:39.479 --> 40:40.845
and shout, "Lock the doors!"

40:41.064 --> 40:43.021
Sometimes it sounds
like his music is jazz

40:43.232 --> 40:44.188
put into a Cuisinart.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.313
It's just, you know,
chopped up and there it is.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.357
Well, George Antheil
wrote a book

40:53.576 --> 40:58.116
called <i>Bad Boy of Music,</i>
and in chapter 32,

40:58.331 --> 41:02.200
"Hedy Lamarr and I invent
a radio torpedo."

41:02.418 --> 41:05.206
He says,
"We began talking about the war,

41:05.421 --> 41:07.162
which in the late summer
of 1940,

41:07.382 --> 41:10.090
was looking
most extremely black."

41:10.301 --> 41:11.963
Hedy said that she did not feel
comfortable

41:12.178 --> 41:14.295
sitting there in Hollywood
and making lots of money

41:14.514 --> 41:16.255
when things were
in such a state,

41:16.474 --> 41:18.932
and that she was thinking
seriously of quitting MGM

41:19.143 --> 41:21.601
and going to Washington D.C.
to offer her services

41:21.813 --> 41:24.476
to the newly established
Inventors Council.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.609
She was very patriotic,
she loved America.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.655
She was grateful to be here,
and she wanted Hitler dead.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.777
So did George Antheil.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.859
George had a kid brother
12 years younger

41:37.078 --> 41:40.071
whose name was Henry.

41:40.289 --> 41:44.533
1941, he boarded a plane,
and moments later,

41:44.752 --> 41:47.586
the plane was shot down
by two Soviet fighters.

41:47.797 --> 41:51.461
This is the first American
killed in World War Il.

41:53.553 --> 41:56.466
George, he was just devastated.

41:58.433 --> 42:02.347
He wanted revenge
for his brother's assassination

42:02.562 --> 42:05.555
and opportunity
with someone who knew

42:05.773 --> 42:07.639
what she was talking about.

42:09.402 --> 42:13.066
Hedy and George worked
on three inventions together,

42:13.281 --> 42:17.400
all weapons meant to help
the Allies fight Germany.

42:17.618 --> 42:19.905
I have letters
from George Antheil.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.828
In one of the letters, he wrote,

42:22.040 --> 42:25.124
"All she wants to do
is stay home and invent things.

42:25.334 --> 42:28.873
She is an incredible combination
of childish ignorance

42:29.088 --> 42:32.047
and definite flashes of genius."

42:33.968 --> 42:36.085
"She calls
in the middle of the night

42:36.304 --> 42:37.795
because an idea hit her."

42:40.266 --> 42:41.928
So, my mother was a pest.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.635
She had to invent,
she had to invent,

42:44.854 --> 42:47.938
and she pulled George Antheil
in with her.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.482
The most successful
of their inventions

42:50.693 --> 42:53.276
was a secret
communication system

42:53.488 --> 42:56.276
based on Hedy's idea
of frequency hopping.

42:56.491 --> 42:57.777
George is taking
all these notes,

42:57.992 --> 43:00.109
and I think there was
some sort of a-ha moment

43:00.328 --> 43:02.615
where he said,
"You know, I have this system,"

43:02.830 --> 43:06.119
I guess he got from dealing
with player pianos,

43:06.334 --> 43:08.701
"that we might be able to adapt

43:08.920 --> 43:12.630
and make... make
your concept work."

43:12.840 --> 43:14.627
George Antheil got thrown
out of Trenton High School

43:14.842 --> 43:16.174
when he was 17,

43:16.385 --> 43:19.503
so he had no special training
in engineering.

43:19.722 --> 43:23.215
What he did know was how
to synchronize player pianos.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.562
George's
most famous composition

43:28.773 --> 43:32.232
was for a film called
<i>Ballet Mécanique.</i>

43:32.443 --> 43:37.188
He scored it
for 16 player pianos.

43:37.406 --> 43:39.147
George's big realization was,

43:39.367 --> 43:41.734
if piano rolls
can activate piano keys,

43:41.953 --> 43:44.445
why couldn't they activate
radio frequencies

43:44.664 --> 43:46.951
in both torpedo and the ship?

43:48.334 --> 43:50.701
The basic idea
is that by using

43:50.920 --> 43:54.004
two miniature piano rolls

43:54.215 --> 43:56.298
that would start
at the same moment

43:56.509 --> 43:59.172
and turn at the same speed,

43:59.387 --> 44:03.131
a ship and a torpedo
could secretly communicate

44:03.349 --> 44:06.137
on the same pattern
of frequencies.

44:06.352 --> 44:09.641
Ultimately, Hedy and George
wanted their torpedo and ship

44:09.856 --> 44:12.724
to communicate
on 88 different frequencies,

44:12.942 --> 44:14.399
like an encryption system,
basically,

44:14.610 --> 44:16.192
that nobody could crack.

44:17.738 --> 44:19.479
Wonderfully clever idea.

44:19.699 --> 44:21.656
And the Inventors Council
agreed.

44:21.868 --> 44:23.700
<i>The members of the National
Inventors Council...</i>

44:23.911 --> 44:28.246
And it was a council
of actual engineers

44:28.457 --> 44:30.164
with a major inventor
in his own right,

44:30.376 --> 44:31.617
Charles Kettering,

44:31.836 --> 44:34.704
who was struck by the value
and the originality

44:34.922 --> 44:37.084
of Hedy and George's idea.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.212
So they helped George and Hedy

44:39.427 --> 44:42.795
by connecting them up
with a physicist at Caltech

44:43.014 --> 44:46.132
in California who was
an expert on electronics.

44:46.350 --> 44:47.841
And he presumably designed

44:48.060 --> 44:50.894
the electronics part
of this device.

44:51.105 --> 44:54.815
The day came
when this invention

44:55.026 --> 44:56.358
was issued a full patent.

45:01.365 --> 45:04.073
Hedy and George
donated their invention

45:04.285 --> 45:06.823
to the National Inventors
Council,

45:07.038 --> 45:08.870
but it was generally understood

45:09.081 --> 45:11.448
that if the military
used an invention,

45:11.667 --> 45:13.579
the inventors would be paid.

45:15.838 --> 45:18.000
They gave it to the Navy,

45:18.216 --> 45:22.005
and as George Antheil
liked to tell the story later,

45:22.220 --> 45:24.007
I went in to see the Navy Brass

45:24.222 --> 45:27.010
and they threw the patent
on the desk and said,

45:27.225 --> 45:28.261
"What do you want to do,

45:28.476 --> 45:31.014
put a player piano in a torpedo?

45:31.229 --> 45:32.720
Get out of here!"

45:33.981 --> 45:35.142
And that was that.

45:35.358 --> 45:37.520
Sons of bitches.

45:37.735 --> 45:38.646
Shame.

45:38.861 --> 45:39.942
Shame on them.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.362
Well, that's why
I was in the Army,

45:42.573 --> 45:44.986
because the Navy
was never that bright.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.245
After the Navy
rejected their invention,

45:58.464 --> 46:01.423
Hedy wanted to continue
developing it.

46:01.634 --> 46:04.251
But George,
who always had bills to pay,

46:04.470 --> 46:07.258
wasn't interested.

46:07.473 --> 46:09.465
I think George was very proud
that he had done it,

46:09.684 --> 46:12.176
but I think he just got over it.

46:12.395 --> 46:13.681
I think that for Hedy,

46:13.896 --> 46:17.139
she saw it as perhaps
her ticket to be recognized

46:17.358 --> 46:20.226
for the brilliant woman
that she was.

46:25.533 --> 46:29.072
And the patent, like all things
submitted to the military,

46:29.287 --> 46:32.200
was put in a safe somewhere
and labeled Top Secret.

46:32.415 --> 46:34.327
So it disappeared from the world

46:34.542 --> 46:36.283
for the rest of the war.

46:41.132 --> 46:43.966
The Navy basically told her,

46:44.176 --> 46:48.136
"You know, you'd be helping
the war a lot more, little lady,

46:48.347 --> 46:50.805
if you got out
and sold war bonds

46:51.017 --> 46:52.349
rather than sat around

46:52.560 --> 46:55.394
trying to invent
new kinds of torpedoes.

46:55.604 --> 46:57.220
Leave that to the experts.

46:57.440 --> 47:00.683
Get out there
and raise money."

47:00.901 --> 47:04.986
You don't get to be
Hedy Lamarr and smart.

47:05.197 --> 47:06.062
No.

47:07.575 --> 47:08.361
No.

47:11.787 --> 47:15.121
<i>I worked for the government
at the bond tour.</i>

47:15.333 --> 47:17.074
<i>Really? How?</i>

47:17.293 --> 47:20.206
<i>By appearing,
by dancing with these people.</i>

47:22.423 --> 47:24.710
Hedy used to go
to the Hollywood Canteen

47:24.925 --> 47:27.167
and entertain the troops.

47:27.386 --> 47:29.469
<i>Hedy Lamarr
hands out autographs.</i>

47:29.680 --> 47:32.673
She was not yet
an American citizen

47:32.892 --> 47:37.728
and she was there working
on behalf of the United States

47:37.938 --> 47:39.895
and its soldiers every night

47:40.107 --> 47:41.564
as often as she could be.

47:41.776 --> 47:44.109
It's a great thing, really.

47:44.320 --> 47:48.985
Hedy sold something like
$25 million worth of war bonds,

47:49.200 --> 47:52.238
which if you translate that
into modern dollars,

47:52.453 --> 47:57.994
comes out around $343 million
worth of war bonds.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.253
To be told to just raise money
for the war,

48:03.464 --> 48:04.580
it's unfortunate.

48:04.799 --> 48:07.132
That was the way that people
thought that she would do good

48:07.343 --> 48:10.882
in the best way within
her realm of capabilities.

48:11.097 --> 48:13.054
F-35, somebody have it?

48:13.265 --> 48:14.005
I've got it!

48:14.225 --> 48:15.215
Go ahead!

48:15.434 --> 48:16.845
Oh no.

48:17.061 --> 48:21.146
Like, go and sell a kiss
to a strange man.

48:21.357 --> 48:24.316
Maybe... maybe she would have felt
a little bit better

48:24.527 --> 48:27.565
about her accomplishments
if she received recognition

48:27.780 --> 48:29.772
for her intellect.

48:29.990 --> 48:31.231
Oh, you'll get used to it.

48:31.450 --> 48:33.112
I don't want to get used to it.

48:33.327 --> 48:34.192
I have my own life.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.244
My own life!

48:36.455 --> 48:38.071
To add insult to injury,

48:38.290 --> 48:42.751
the U.S. Government seized
Hedy's patent in 1942

48:42.962 --> 48:45.079
as the property
of an enemy alien.

48:47.216 --> 48:48.878
<i>I don't understand.</i>

48:49.093 --> 48:51.585
<i>They use me for selling bonds,</i>

48:51.804 --> 48:52.965
<i>then I'm not an alien.</i>

48:53.180 --> 48:55.092
<i>And when I invent something
for this country</i>

48:55.307 --> 48:57.299
<i>I am an alien?</i>

49:04.733 --> 49:07.897
I am Tandelayo.

49:08.112 --> 49:11.230
After she did the invention,

49:11.449 --> 49:14.066
what did Louis B. Mayer
offer Hedy Lamarr?

49:16.287 --> 49:17.573
<i>White Cargo.</i>

49:23.002 --> 49:25.289
We were at war by then
and Louis B. Mayer

49:25.504 --> 49:27.416
wanted to entertain
the servicemen

49:27.631 --> 49:28.747
who would pay money

49:28.966 --> 49:31.424
to see what was considered
a dirty picture.

49:35.181 --> 49:37.093
Louis B. Mayer
divided the world

49:37.308 --> 49:39.550
into two kinds of women,

49:39.768 --> 49:41.555
Madonna and whore.

49:43.689 --> 49:45.180
I don't think he ever believed

49:45.399 --> 49:48.142
she was anything but the latter

49:48.360 --> 49:51.023
because of <i>Ecstasy.</i>

49:51.238 --> 49:52.570
You better go now.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.195
Audiences ate it up.

49:59.413 --> 50:04.875
This was a woman who had tried
to change the course of the war.

50:05.085 --> 50:08.123
Now she found herself
in a third rate film

50:08.339 --> 50:11.252
as a distraction
for the troops.

50:13.677 --> 50:17.261
<i>They think I'm a bad actress.</i>

50:17.473 --> 50:21.092
<i>I think sometimes in life
I act more than on the screen.</i>

50:24.146 --> 50:27.389
Hedy really struggled
to make her mark in Hollywood.

50:27.608 --> 50:29.565
She knew she wasn't respected

50:29.777 --> 50:32.269
like a Garbo or a Dietrich.

50:32.488 --> 50:37.700
She wanted to have roles that
allowed her to do something more

50:37.910 --> 50:39.822
and to give her
an acting challenge.

50:40.037 --> 50:45.874
So that brought her in some
conflict with Louis B. Mayer.

50:46.085 --> 50:47.826
He sued her a couple times.

50:48.045 --> 50:50.128
I mean, he tried to keep her
on a very tight leash.

50:50.339 --> 50:52.626
She wouldn't let herself
be kept on a tight leash

50:52.841 --> 50:54.207
and there were always problems.

50:54.426 --> 50:57.794
And she got the reputation
of being difficult.

51:04.979 --> 51:07.892
<i>I believe that we are
controlled by ourselves,</i>

51:08.107 --> 51:09.063
<i>by our way of thinking,</i>

51:09.275 --> 51:11.392
<i>by our way
of dealing with people.</i>

51:11.610 --> 51:12.896
<i>I mean, there comes a point</i>

51:13.112 --> 51:14.193
<i>when you can't take anymore...</i>

51:14.405 --> 51:16.692
<i>then you have to
make yourself heard.</i>

51:18.033 --> 51:21.071
She needed to be free.

51:21.287 --> 51:25.156
I think she was brave
and courageous.

51:25.374 --> 51:27.286
She felt like,
"I'm gonna do it for myself.

51:27.501 --> 51:29.208
I'm gonna live the way...

51:29.420 --> 51:30.752
I bloody wanna live
my own life."

51:32.131 --> 51:33.212
So she said,
"Well, you know what?

51:33.424 --> 51:34.460
I'll make my own movie.

51:34.675 --> 51:36.632
I'll produce my own movie."

51:39.471 --> 51:41.963
I don't really recall
anybody except Hedy

51:42.182 --> 51:45.175
went out and actually
produced a movie.

51:45.394 --> 51:49.183
It was very unusual in 1946.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.014
The system didn't welcome it,

51:51.233 --> 51:53.896
they didn't want movie stars
going out of control

51:54.111 --> 51:55.397
and producing their own films.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.479
What a terrible idea.

51:57.698 --> 52:00.816
Especially the women.

52:01.035 --> 52:04.153
She was so ahead of her time
with being a feminist.

52:05.956 --> 52:09.791
She's never been called that,
but she certainly was.

52:10.002 --> 52:11.743
Don't worry about me.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.669
I can handle trouble.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.964
I know you can.

52:16.175 --> 52:19.714
And then she co-produced
<i>Dishonored Lady,</i>

52:19.928 --> 52:23.217
and I think that both films
were produced very well.

52:27.603 --> 52:30.311
She made <i>Dishonored Lady</i>
with my father.

52:30.522 --> 52:32.889
It's the only movie
they were in together.

52:33.108 --> 52:35.145
I've always wondered
if it were possible for people

52:35.361 --> 52:37.068
like you and me.

52:37.279 --> 52:40.693
This was a time
when America was recovering

52:40.908 --> 52:43.025
from World War Il.

52:43.243 --> 52:44.825
And like the rest
of the country,

52:45.037 --> 52:47.950
she too wanted a family
and a home life.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.083
<i>I was married
and married because</i>

52:52.294 --> 52:56.538
<i>I liked the companionship
of a man, obviously.</i>

52:56.757 --> 52:59.875
I think, you know, he was quite
a bit older and British.

53:00.094 --> 53:02.302
I don't think he was
the love of her life.

53:02.513 --> 53:05.176
I think she had said
he was stuffy and boring.

53:05.391 --> 53:08.259
You know, you're not
at all what I imagined.

53:08.477 --> 53:09.513
No?

53:09.728 --> 53:11.139
No.

53:11.355 --> 53:14.223
So this is a letter
from George Antheil.

53:14.441 --> 53:16.023
"The last time I saw Hedy,

53:16.235 --> 53:17.351
she looked paler.

53:17.569 --> 53:19.276
Something's troubling her.

53:19.488 --> 53:22.356
John Loder is really
and honestly too dull

53:22.574 --> 53:26.284
for this sparkling
and unbelievable diamond."

53:26.495 --> 53:29.203
And I think he hit the nail
on the head with that one.

53:30.708 --> 53:33.246
She was independent,
she was the breadwinner.

53:33.460 --> 53:35.543
She wasn't stuck
in a marriage.

53:35.754 --> 53:37.120
Will you please go?

53:37.339 --> 53:39.205
Of course I'll go.

53:39.425 --> 53:42.384
I think he left, I was a toddler
and Tony was a baby,

53:42.594 --> 53:44.381
and I never heard from him.

53:47.474 --> 53:50.842
She was a single mother
in the '40s,

53:51.061 --> 53:53.098
so she was basically alone.

53:55.524 --> 53:56.731
When we were little,

53:56.942 --> 54:01.653
she was the most charming,
lovely person I can imagine.

54:01.864 --> 54:03.696
And so nice
and warm and loving,

54:03.907 --> 54:06.775
and she opened my hands
that were held in a ball,

54:06.994 --> 54:08.735
"Relax, don't go
to sleep angry."

54:08.954 --> 54:11.071
She was just
such a great mother.

54:11.290 --> 54:14.203
<i>I taught my children swimming.</i>

54:14.418 --> 54:18.128
<i>The little children have
little armbands to swim.</i>

54:18.338 --> 54:19.670
<i>- Have you ever seen that?
- Yes.</i>

54:19.882 --> 54:21.794
<i>Makes absolutely no sense.</i>

54:22.009 --> 54:24.217
<i>because the middle,
the center</i>

54:24.428 --> 54:26.795
<i>is where they should be lifted.</i>

54:27.014 --> 54:28.004
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

54:28.223 --> 54:29.589
<i>That's how I taught
my children</i>

54:29.808 --> 54:31.720
<i>and they swim like fish.</i>

54:33.228 --> 54:36.221
<i>They really were good as gold.</i>

54:37.357 --> 54:40.225
<i>I did a good job with them.</i>

54:40.444 --> 54:42.436
<i>It made me a little tired
but that's...</i>

54:42.654 --> 54:44.236
<i>that's part of it, the job,
I guess.</i>

54:46.283 --> 54:47.774
My mother worked her ass off.

54:47.993 --> 54:49.109
She had to earn a living.

54:49.328 --> 54:50.284
She was on her own.

54:50.496 --> 54:52.237
It was such pressure.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.874
At least she didn't have
to worry about granny.

54:56.084 --> 54:58.121
By then she'd made it
safely to California

54:58.337 --> 55:00.329
and Mom paid for her
to live nearby.

55:00.547 --> 55:03.585
Financially, Hedy wasn't
in the best of shape.

55:03.801 --> 55:05.212
She had two independent films,

55:05.427 --> 55:07.259
she made a lousy comedy,

55:07.471 --> 55:10.885
and she knew she was going
in the gutter career-wise.

55:11.099 --> 55:13.967
She needed a breath
of fresh air.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.768
And just by a stroke of luck,

55:15.979 --> 55:17.641
her agent at the time mentioned,

55:17.856 --> 55:21.020
"Well, I was talking
to C.B. the other day,"

55:21.235 --> 55:22.396
Cecil B. DeMille,

55:22.611 --> 55:24.352
great motion picture producer.

55:24.571 --> 55:27.484
He was just beginning
his biblical epics

55:27.699 --> 55:30.112
of sex and sand.

55:30.327 --> 55:32.239
And Hedy called Cecil B. DeMille
and said,

55:32.454 --> 55:35.572
"I understand you're casting
for a new motion picture.

55:35.791 --> 55:37.123
I am Delilah."

55:38.627 --> 55:41.119
No man leaves Delilah.

55:46.134 --> 55:47.250
Look at her, Samson.

55:47.469 --> 55:49.085
Look well.

55:49.304 --> 55:53.344
Satan himself taught her
all the arts of deception.

55:53.559 --> 55:55.471
Howard Hawks had a great line
about DeMille.

55:55.686 --> 55:57.177
He says, "You know,

55:57.396 --> 55:59.763
DeMille is so bad
he's almost good."

56:03.193 --> 56:05.981
But anyway, <i>Samson and Delilah</i>
was a huge hit.

56:06.196 --> 56:08.028
I think it was
her biggest success.

56:08.240 --> 56:10.698
It thoroughly
revived Hedy's name

56:10.909 --> 56:14.118
into the public consciousness.

56:14.329 --> 56:17.117
<i>Samson and Delilah</i> was
the second highest grossing film

56:17.332 --> 56:18.789
of the decade.

56:19.001 --> 56:22.870
Only <i>Gone with the Wind</i>
surpassed it.

56:23.088 --> 56:24.579
Hedy took notice.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.790
She decided to produce
her own epic

56:27.009 --> 56:29.251
in the style of DeMille.

56:29.469 --> 56:32.257
She would film it in Italy
and title it

56:32.472 --> 56:34.555
<i>The Loves of Three Queens.</i>

56:39.062 --> 56:42.100
Hedy played
all three lead roles.

56:42.316 --> 56:43.932
The subject was beauty

56:44.151 --> 56:45.858
and how it got
in the way of love

56:46.069 --> 56:47.810
for the great women of history.

56:48.030 --> 56:50.317
They're leading you into a trap.

56:50.532 --> 56:53.070
Oh, Napoleon, you're blind.

56:53.285 --> 56:55.151
There is no choice.

56:55.370 --> 56:57.032
It was a huge production.

56:57.247 --> 56:58.203
She didn't have the training

56:58.415 --> 57:01.203
to take on a project
of this size.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.125
And when she was finished
with it,

57:03.337 --> 57:07.297
she couldn't find distribution
in the United States.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.669
She spent millions
of dollars on it,

57:09.885 --> 57:11.968
no one would touch it.

57:12.179 --> 57:13.465
She lost all her money.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.171
She found herself with nothing.

57:16.558 --> 57:20.142
<i>I'm a good artist
and a very bad business person.</i>

57:22.481 --> 57:23.722
She's no longer a star

57:23.941 --> 57:26.228
and she doesn't really have
any money.

57:28.236 --> 57:30.819
She was in Houston for an event

57:31.031 --> 57:34.320
and she ran into Howard Lee
the oil man.

57:34.534 --> 57:40.280
And then I found out
my name was now Tony Lee.

57:40.499 --> 57:42.240
And we were living in Texas.

57:53.428 --> 57:57.138
Mom actually had a Texas twang
with a Viennese accent.

57:57.349 --> 57:59.682
It was hilarious.

57:59.893 --> 58:02.135
He was a nice guy.

58:02.354 --> 58:06.223
I really kind of felt Texan
for a while.

58:06.441 --> 58:11.687
In Texas, Hedy found herself
a trophy wife again.

58:11.905 --> 58:14.397
You know, Texas was retirement.

58:14.616 --> 58:17.700
But a creative person
needs something to do.

58:17.911 --> 58:19.948
She didn't have much to do.

58:23.792 --> 58:26.910
We went on vacation
in Aspen, Colorado.

58:27.129 --> 58:29.212
<i>I used to ski
when I was a young girl.</i>

58:29.423 --> 58:32.166
<i>I skied to school,
I skied all over the place.</i>

58:34.136 --> 58:35.547
<i>And I went through Aspen.</i>

58:35.762 --> 58:37.719
<i>There was nobody there.
Nothing.</i>

58:37.931 --> 58:40.093
<i>Just a little store
and a few houses.</i>

58:40.308 --> 58:44.518
<i>And they said, "This could be a
very wonderful skiing resort."</i>

58:44.730 --> 58:47.894
<i>So I started to build
a place called Villa Lamarr.</i>

58:48.108 --> 58:50.225
She wanted to build
a ski resort,

58:50.444 --> 58:53.107
so she convinced Howard
to buy some land.

58:54.489 --> 58:56.856
It was all Austrian,
it's beautiful.

58:57.075 --> 58:59.158
She spent years
making that place.

59:00.245 --> 59:03.158
She created some
of her homeland.

59:03.373 --> 59:05.615
That's why it meant
a lot to her.

59:05.834 --> 59:09.453
She was really,
I think, homesick.

59:12.507 --> 59:13.497
It was after that

59:13.717 --> 59:17.085
that everything
started falling apart.

59:17.304 --> 59:19.341
Their relationship wasn't good.

59:19.556 --> 59:23.266
It was pretty traumatic;
he was an alcoholic.

59:23.477 --> 59:25.514
<i>With children it was very
difficult so I walked away.</i>

59:25.729 --> 59:28.972
<i>I said, "All I want is Aspen,"
which I built myself.</i>

59:29.191 --> 59:30.682
<i>My chalet there which makes</i>

59:30.901 --> 59:32.938
<i>a million a day,
I suppose, now.</i>

59:35.447 --> 59:36.608
Hedy told me again and again

59:36.823 --> 59:39.782
about her divorce
with Howard Lee.

59:39.993 --> 59:42.326
May be the darkest time
in her life.

59:43.955 --> 59:44.866
<i>And then my daughter said,</i>

59:45.082 --> 59:47.699
<i>"Ma, something happened
to Tony."</i>

59:47.918 --> 59:51.082
<i>My son was almost killed
in a car accident.</i>

59:53.465 --> 59:56.128
While her son was
in the hospital near death,

59:56.343 --> 59:59.427
Hedy was called to testify
in divorce court.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:03.097
Stressed and traumatized
to the point of breakdown,

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:05.550
she sent
her Hollywood body double

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.227
to testify in her place.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.976
She infuriated the judge,

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.274
who punished her
by cutting her share

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:15.898
of the divorce settlement.

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:17.945
<i>He took everything away.</i>

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:20.489
<i>Aspen, which was beautiful.</i>

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.283
<i>I mean, it was a big shock.</i>

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:25.782
<i>So with the pressure here
and pressure all over</i>

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:28.330
<i>that's all I needed.
So I collapsed.</i>

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:31.159
<i>I had a nervous breakdown.</i>

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:33.961
<i>I feel like I was dead for...</i>

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.710
<i>I don't know how long,
but I was dead.</i>

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:41.135
<i>And so much so that this light
you see really exists</i>

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:44.054
<i>on the ceiling.</i>

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:45.177
<i>I saw my father.</i>

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:51.141
She said Emil, her father,

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:52.346
was her greatest love,

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.649
or no one could compare to him.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:59.730
Well, he knew her
before she was this celebrity.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:02.486
And so she felt
real love there.

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:05.034
And I don't know
if she felt that again.

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:09.614
Hedy had two more husbands
in her life.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.667
Neither marriage lasted
much more than a year.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.997
I wish my mother had a husband

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:19.707
who knew how to love her.

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.007
But she never did.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:27.094
When I ended up living
with her after Texas,

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:31.144
it was very, very tricky,
very hard.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:36.016
I think the drugs
were very responsible.

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:39.147
The slightest thing could...
could set her off.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:40.944
There was erratic behavior.

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:44.900
She was becoming more unstable.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:48.361
I guess it pretty much
started with Jimmy.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:54.037
As an adult,
I was looking at baby pictures

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:56.084
and it was my first birthday
with my mom...

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:58.333
and mother and father behind me.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.416
And in between them, a boy.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:03.342
Um, I told Mom,

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.294
"Who's this boy?"

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:06.924
And she literally said,

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.224
"Oh, it was an adoption
that didn't work out."

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:13.143
She told me that
he was really rebellious

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:16.223
and was acting out big time.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:20.025
And Jimmy was put
in a military boarding school.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:22.320
So the sports coach

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.772
kind of took Jimmy
under his wing,

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:26.482
coach and the wife,

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:31.287
and he asked Hedy
if he could live with them.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:34.912
And Mom was apparently so hurt
she said yes.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.078
And I can't believe
that I have no memory of him.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:44.175
She's my mother and I love her.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:47.845
I called her sometimes
and she called me sometimes.

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.136
I never really blamed her
for anything,

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:53.058
I... I just...

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.104
I knew she was upset
because I, you know,

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:58.772
kind of like slapped her
in the face.

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:01.943
Like saying,
"I don't love you anymore."

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:06.147
But still I never saw her
after that for 40-some years.

01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:10.738
She was a woman of extremes.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.871
I mean, Hedy can just
leave things behind.

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:18.121
She cut off Jimmy,
she cut off being Jewish.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:22.046
She was broken, she was
missing pieces of herself.

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:27.255
A lot of stars
from the studio system

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:33.558
did carry over this addiction
to pep pills, speed.

01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:35.930
It does explain, in hindsight,

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.138
a lot of her behavior.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:45.565
There are always
a great many rumors

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:50.275
about her connection
to the famous Dr. Feelgood.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:56.660
Dr. Feelgood was Max Jacobson.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:58.366
Look at
the Aretha Franklin song,

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.123
"Oh, Dr. Feelgood,
please make me feel good."

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.125
Everybody called him
Dr. Feelgood

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.208
because he made them
feel good.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.213
When Cecil B. DeMille
had his heart attack

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:10.260
on the set
of <i>The Ten Commandments,</i>

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:11.963
he flew Dr. Max over.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.047
And then DeMille said,

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:14.131
"Go inject Charlton Heston.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:15.307
There's not enough energy.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:18.306
His Moses is too lackadaisical."

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.727
Hedy Lamarr
became a patient of his

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.400
from the 1950s
until Max Jacobson

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:30.073
lost his medical license
in 1974.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:33.526
<i>Somebody did me in
like many times</i>

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:36.488
<i>and gave me a shot.
I don't know what it was.</i>

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:39.414
<i>I thought it was vitamins
but it wasn't.</i>

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:41.288
Said, "Oh, you should try
these vitamin B shots.

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:43.165
They give you so much energy."

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.163
What Max Jacobson said

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.751
is they were
special vitamin elixirs.

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:51.551
And he loaded up a vial

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:54.631
with 40 milligrams
of methamphetamine.

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:56.636
Meth was legal.

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:58.638
And he gave Hedy a shot.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.639
And the thing
about methamphetamine

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:04.314
is once you get
a couple of shots,

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.688
you're hooked
because the brain will demand

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.895
more and more of that reward.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:15.026
So she got hooked
on these "vitamins."

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:21.082
And they turned her
into a monster.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:23.158
I was standing in the kitchen

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:25.210
and she was holding a fork
and she dropped it.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.960
And all of a sudden
she just hauls up and, bam,

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.461
smashes me across the face.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:33.636
"Whenever I drop something,
you pick it up!"

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:38.091
You know,
she was just out of control.

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:41.427
Now I can be forgiving
for all that erratic behavior

01:05:41.646 --> 01:05:44.389
because in a way
she was a victim

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:47.441
of the very system
that made her famous.

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:58.410
<i>Thank you very much.
Howdy-hi, Shindiggers.</i>

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.079
<i>I'm Jimmy O'Neill and tonight
it's my great pleasure</i>

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:04.079
<i>to introduce the beautiful
Ms. Hedy Lamarr.</i>

01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:12.838
Of course anyone growing up
in Hollywood in the early '60s

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:15.590
was aware of her
as the kind of caricature

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:18.468
of herself that she had become.

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:20.140
Lucille Ball, I remember,

01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:24.766
used to do an outrageous
takeoff of Tandelayo.

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:37.241
I am Tandelayo.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.158
I think it was offensive to her.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:43.989
She didn't want to be a joke.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:48.540
Mom was not in a good...
good way

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.371
when I was away at college.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.173
I remember one day
walking to school at Cal,

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:54.249
with my books,

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:55.960
and I walked past a newsstand

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.011
and there's a picture
of Mom in jail.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:03.516
Mrs. Lamarr was shopping

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:05.390
at the May Company
Department Store

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:06.937
and evidently was arrested

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.434
by one of the security personnel

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:10.016
of the store.

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:11.442
And it was apparent that she had

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:15.067
something like
approximately $14,000 on her,

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:18.490
but she had still taken
about $80 worth of merchandise.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.239
When you see that
on the front page,

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:23.366
it's like you want
to just crawl in a hole.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:26.577
The defendant
is quoted as saying,

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:28.455
"I didn't mean
to steal anything.

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:30.377
I'll be glad to pay
for the items.

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:33.046
I have the money."

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.874
She was acquitted for that.

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:37.176
She said it was
a misunderstanding.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:39.049
Who knows?

01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:42.177
You know, a lot of people
handle stress in different ways.

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.643
It was a shock.

01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:50.063
She was such a big star.

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:53.063
She seemed so untouchable

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:54.610
to be reduced to that.

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.687
And I think that
most people thought

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.193
it must be a kind
of mental illness.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.446
I want to see the store manager.

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:02.447
No.

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:03.948
I want to see the store manager.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.404
You're not seeing
the store manager.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:07.489
Andy Warhol's
school of filmmaking

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:12.044
makes a film that is very
obviously lampooning her image.

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:14.588
And she becomes,
essentially, a punch line.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:18.006
The shoplifting also resulted

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:20.211
in her inability
to play her final role.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:22.845
She was signed to do

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:24.389
<i>Picture Mommy Dead</i>

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.594
and Zsa Zsa Gabor
stepped in to replace her.

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:29.223
They just fired me.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.145
- Were you shocked?
- No.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.189
I'm not shocked at that, no.

01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:35.188
This is gonna go
into your book, I trust.

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:37.064
Oh, yes, indeed.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.111
What's the name of that book?

01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:40.986
The longer I wait,
the better the book gets.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.533
Somebody suggested
doing her autobiography,

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:45.236
that she should do it.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.822
She had no interest
in the book itself,

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.533
but she wanted
the money from it.

01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:53.995
There really hadn't been
any sort of scandalous tell-all.

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:56.626
She spoke with ghostwriters

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.707
for many, many hours
about her past,

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:00.917
and then they translated
her memories

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.298
into a narrative.

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:04.220
I think her business manager
was paid off

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:07.345
to get all this stuff past her.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.221
And she didn't want to deal
with paperwork,

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.053
so she just trusted him.

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:15.185
Your book,
called <i>Ecstasy and Me...</i>

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:16.733
Don't talk about that.

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.060
That's not my book.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.564
- You wrote it.
- No.

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:22.273
Did that hurt your image
in Hollywood?

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:23.903
I don't know what is an image.

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:25.904
I mean,
what's your image, Woody?

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.486
What's my im... same as yours.

01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:31.741
Okay, now you want me
to tell you what your image is?

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:34.542
- Yeah.
- It's a glamorous,

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:36.837
beautiful,

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.631
internationally known star

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.300
who obviously rides
in limousines

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.923
and has great jewels

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:46.926
and you don't scrub
your kitchen floors.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.474
I don't like that, no,
but tell me more.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.176
I never lived that way.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:52.978
Isn't that what it's all about?

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.555
No, not to me.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.140
I guess in the image it is.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:01.066
She was known for her glamour
and her beauty.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.691
It was impossible to live up to

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:04.523
as she got older.

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:06.608
She would see that

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:08.865
and you knew
that it disturbed her.

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:14.374
She started having
plastic surgery in her 40s.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.666
One of her plastic surgeons
told me once

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.589
that she was a groundbreaker
even in plastic surgery

01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:24.009
where she came up with ideas.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.258
She said, "My arms are crepey
and I want you to cut here

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:28.805
right in the line of the fold

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:30.382
and I want you to get rid
of the excess skin

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.058
and leave the scar here.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:35.263
Leave the scar on my knee,
behind my knee.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.518
Put the scar behind my ear.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:40.647
And they did it
and the surgeons said, you know,

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:42.103
"A lot of these things she did

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.153
we were never doing before."

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:48.324
You'll mention her
to an older plastic surgeon

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.198
and they remember their...

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.245
all their actresses
coming in saying,

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:54.289
"You know, well, Hedy,
she had this done.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.457
Can I get this done too?"

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.535
She was really one of the first
women out there saying,

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.041
"Why isn't this possible?

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.463
Why can't we do this?"

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.463
She looked wonderful
for her age,

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:07.294
but all of that didn't work

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.675
because people still wanted

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:12.429
that old image of Hedy Lamarr.

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:15.181
You know, the only thing
that would have...

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:16.932
that would have solved
the problem

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:19.185
is if she'd died young.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:23.231
People were cruel to her.

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.985
People would come up and say,
"You <i>were</i> so beautiful."

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.532
The press was mean.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.163
I said, "Oh, Mom,

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:40.165
I feel I really have empathy
for that pressure on you."

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:43.838
So no wonder
she kind of hid away.

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:54.349
<i>Do you think
you are unsociable?</i>

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:56.059
Me? No!

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.894
Have I been reserved with you?

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:02.190
<i>No, I mean are you unsociable
here in America?</i>

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:06.395
I only know that they
do not understand me.

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:10.984
How can you understand
a person who

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:14.703
has had as many phases
in life as I have?

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:17.657
I have been through a lot,
my whole life.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.207
You start to think,

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:26.961
"I have experienced
everything now in life."

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.168
"Now I want peace."

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:32.471
I miss Vienna.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:34.924
I would like to make
a movie about it.

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.849
<i>What would the movie look like?</i>

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:43.899
<i>All of the nice things
I have seen when I was a child.</i>

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:47.103
<i>The opera.</i>

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:50.655
<i>The Spanish Riding School.</i>

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:52.608
<i>Schönbrunn Palace.</i>

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:55.160
<i>My school in Döbling.</i>

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:58.535
Whatever, I don't know.

01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:01.082
I am always Austrian.

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:20.769
We met in person
two times in my life.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:24.269
She would send me
autographed pictures of herself,

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:25.894
you know,

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:29.899
which they're mostly like
those studio prints.

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.107
Even though she says
it was a curse,

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:38.071
that's what people liked
and loved about her and she...

01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:41.578
for some reason I think
she thought even her family,

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:45.160
her grandchildren,
her children want that.

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:53.794
She did a lot of sadly
not so good plastic surgery

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:55.629
in her later years,

01:13:55.848 --> 01:14:00.058
each one fixing the flaws
of the last.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:03.103
And she no longer
went out in public.

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:07.849
And then the money
started running out

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:09.685
because she only got something

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:11.736
from Screen Actors Guild

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.986
and Social Security.

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.908
<i>All they give me $300.</i>

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.155
<i>Per month?</i>

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:19.236
<i>Yep.</i>

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.196
<i>That's not much, is it?</i>

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:23.623
<i>No, it's not very much.</i>

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.746
<i>Have you ever tried to get... uh</i>

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.578
<i>some recompense...
for your idea?</i>

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:28.708
<i>...the patent?</i>

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:29.504
<i>No.</i>

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:34.050
<i>I was surprised that they
don't even acknowledge it.</i>

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:38.881
In 1969, Hedy had written
to a friend in the Navy

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.764
asking if he could find out
what happened to her patent.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:45.972
"Laura Slainier,
Washington Patent Office,

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.102
has an invention of mine,

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.058
a missile-guided torpedo.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:52.519
Maybe you can get it."

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:55.776
So this was important to her.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.824
His reply has been lost,

01:14:58.035 --> 01:15:00.448
but she probably learned
that her idea,

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.029
frequency hopping,

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:06.117
had been put to use
in military communications.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.669
By the time
of the Cuban Missile Crisis,

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.463
when President Kennedy
sent Navy ships

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.007
to blockade Cuba,

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.210
the ships that were running
the blockade

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:19.672
were all equipped
with frequency-hopped radios.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.052
When she found out
that the patent was used,

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:25.261
she thought, "Hey, I should be
making some money from this."

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:28.017
<i>I mean, isn't that normal
to get something?</i>

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:29.188
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.143
<i>Well... apparently
they didn't think so.</i>

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:35.149
<i>Well, it has to do
with the nature of patent law.</i>

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:38.027
<i>I think that it wasn't
actually used</i>

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.653
<i>during the life
of the patent</i>

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:41.531
<i>and it was only after
the patent expired</i>

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:44.113
<i>that it went into common use.</i>

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.538
<i>I don't think so.</i>

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:48.083
<i>They used it before!</i>

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:50.160
For Hedy to be paid,

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.086
the Navy had to use her patent

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:55.962
before it expired in 1959.

01:15:56.177 --> 01:16:00.672
And there's evidence they did
give it to a contractor.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:04.383
Romuald Scibor sent me an email.

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:09.017
And he said, 19...
it was about '55,

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:13.145
he said he was handed
that patent.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.694
And they were tasked
to create a sonobuoy.

01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:22.534
A sonobuoy is a floating
submarine detection device.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:28.869
Someone in the Navy
found the patent and thought,

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:30.576
"Well, I don't know
if there's anything here,

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:32.957
but let's toss it
to a contractor."

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:36.006
And he took that patent
and used it

01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:39.085
as the basis for communications

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.465
from the sonobuoy in the water

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.592
to a passing naval airplane

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:45.424
that would also be secure.

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:51.472
The inventor
of the sonobuoy had a website

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:52.771
where he paid tribute

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:56.067
to the Markey-Antheil invention.

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:57.189
Will you take a look?

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:58.565
Sure.

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:00.940
<i>A Tribute to Hedy Lamarr</i>

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:03.024
by Romuald Scibor-Marchocki.

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:05.327
No, I haven't seen this.

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.245
"I designed the sonobuoy,

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:11.826
one of the first deployments
of frequency hopping."

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:15.253
And he goes on to write
about surveillance drones

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.296
at Aerojet-General.

01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:22.424
"I was the systems manager
building the surveillance drone

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:25.130
which eventually
flew over Vietnam.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:31.811
I personally designed
the reliable and secure

01:17:32.022 --> 01:17:34.730
two-way radio
communications system.

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:36.228
For the first time,

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:40.778
we had the ability
to switch frequencies rapidly.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.949
Now that I know who invented
frequency hopping,

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.868
I, who was the only person
who remembers

01:17:47.079 --> 01:17:50.447
those early applications
of this concept,

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:55.001
want to express
my sincere admiration

01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:58.171
and belated thanks
to Hedy Lamarr."

01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:06.130
How 'bout them apples?

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.136
She should have gotten paid.

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:23.522
<i>What would you have
the government do to repay you?</i>

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:26.905
<i>At this point
I don't even care.</i>

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.497
There she is.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:34.620
The Tyrolean beauty.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.928
Toward the end of Hedy's life

01:18:47.139 --> 01:18:49.973
she began to reflect.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:51.891
She began to have insight.

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:59.395
<i>Well, things don't always
work... straight forward.</i>

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.772
<i>They have detours sometimes.</i>

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:03.148
<i>That's part of living.</i>

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:04.605
<i>Yep.</i>

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:08.533
<i>I didn't expect that I'd come
here and fall apart either</i>

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:10.531
<i>but things happen.</i>

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:15.783
She always talked about
writing her autobiography

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:18.038
and wanting to get
the story out

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:19.870
about who the real
Hedy Lamarr was,

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.546
not the Hedy Lamarr
in the movies,

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:23.214
which I think she often thought

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:25.667
movies were really trivial.

01:19:25.886 --> 01:19:29.425
<i>Now I'm becoming smart
all of a sudden.</i>

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.222
<i>Better late than never, right?</i>

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:32.093
<i>Absolutely.</i>

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:33.971
<i>Maybe someday
I'll become smart too.</i>

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:36.178
<i>I gave you a little lesson
there right now.</i>

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:37.057
<i>Yes ma'am.</i>

01:19:38.565 --> 01:19:39.772
<i>I guess I should let you...</i>

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:40.565
<i>I guess you should.</i>

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.017
<i>...let you go, but...</i>

01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:42.817
<i>I enjoyed talking.</i>

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:44.519
<i>I enjoyed talking to you
and perhaps I'll...</i>

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:46.229
<i>Maybe you can do some good.</i>

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:47.655
<i>I hope so.</i>

01:19:49.326 --> 01:19:51.158
The article I wrote,

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.077
I like to think that
that was really a part

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:56.077
of how she gained recognition.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:59.037
So <i>Forbes</i> magazine,

01:19:59.253 --> 01:20:00.289
May 1990,

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:03.918
this is the first time
the mainstream press

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:07.672
released the information
that Hedy was glamorous, yes,

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:08.842
stupid, no.

01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:13.674
I called her and said, you know,
"Mom, people are interested

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:18.102
in what you thought of
back in '42."

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:20.180
She said, "It's about time."

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:25.143
The first to pick up
Hedy's story

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:28.196
were people
in the communications industry

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:30.490
because they realized
frequency hopping

01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:32.237
was revolutionary.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:37.197
It was already finding
its way into GPS,

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:40.159
Wi-Fi technology, Bluetooth,

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:43.961
and billion-dollar
military satellites.

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:46.916
<i>Five, four, three,</i>

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:48.295
<i>Atlas engine ignition,</i>

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.751
<i>one, zero,</i>

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:52.053
<i>and liftoff
of Lockheed Martin...</i>

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:55.052
The Milstar
satellite system provides

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.600
protected, secure communications

01:20:57.811 --> 01:20:59.222
for the President
of the United States

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:02.181
and high priority
military users.

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:05.233
The work that Hedy Lamarr did
in her patent,

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:07.310
Milstar took that technology

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:08.895
in order to implement
frequency hopping

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:10.070
on the system.

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:12.194
And that's what we trust
our most important

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:16.153
nuclear command
and control messages with.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:18.989
The Navy, Milstar,
and Lockheed Martin

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.369
actually gave Hedy an award

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:23.167
thanking her for coming up
with her idea.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:25.169
And when I called her, I said,

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:28.124
"Mom, they're gonna give you
an award,"

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:31.335
but she just didn't want
to be seen.

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.216
The award I'm about to present
is in recognition

01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:36.969
of a famous actress
turned inventor,

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:38.971
Hedy Lamarr.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:43.430
I gave a talk
to about 800 people.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:44.981
But right in the middle of it...

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:45.978
If I have seen farther...

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:48.484
Oh, my God.

01:21:50.614 --> 01:21:52.105
Are you serious?

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:54.907
My mother's here too.

01:21:55.119 --> 01:21:56.485
I'll tell you
a little bit later.

01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:58.319
Hello?

01:21:58.539 --> 01:21:59.495
How did it go?

01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:01.072
I'm in the middle of it.

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:13.301
I just said, "Mom,
if you could say something,

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:15.094
what would you say?"

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:17.262
And this is what she said.

01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:25.055
<i>I'm happy that this invention
has been so successful.</i>

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:28.233
<i>I appreciate your
acknowledgement</i>

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:31.061
<i>of you honoring me</i>

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.897
<i>and that it was not done
in vain.</i>

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:35.482
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:36.361
<i>Perfect.</i>

01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:37.909
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:38.735
<i>I love you!</i>

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:39.614
<i>Love you too.</i>

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:40.866
<i>Bye.</i>

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:49.708
And they all stood up
and clapped.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:51.380
I thought it was really great.

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:55.298
She would love to be remembered

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:56.878
as someone who contributed

01:22:57.097 --> 01:23:00.306
to the well-being of humankind.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:03.760
She did make her mark.

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:07.768
It's the one thing
she did for other people

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:11.192
that she's gonna be long,
long remembered for.

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:17.115
It was New Year's,

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:19.739
January 1st, 2000.

01:23:19.953 --> 01:23:22.616
She called my sister and I
separately,

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.117
"Turn on the TV!

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.369
It's Vienna, Vienna!

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:26.870
You'll see Vienna!"

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:30.207
And so we turn on the TV

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:32.084
and the Viennese
Symphony Orchestra

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:34.165
was playing on TV.

01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:42.382
She died a few days later.

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:46.227
She fell asleep
and she just didn't wake up.

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:56.025
<i>I'll read you something pretty.</i>

01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:01.452
<i>People are unreasonable,
illogical, and self-centered.</i>

01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:05.372
<i>Love them anyway.</i>

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:07.995
<i>If you do good,
people will accuse you</i>

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:11.374
<i>of selfish alternative motives.</i>

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:12.999
<i>Do good anyway.</i>

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:19.173
<i>The biggest people
with the biggest ideas</i>

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:20.720
<i>can be shot down</i>

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:24.424
<i>by the smallest people
with the smallest minds.</i>

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.760
<i>Think big anyway.</i>

01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:31.685
<i>What you spend years building</i>

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.643
<i>may be destroyed overnight.</i>

01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:37.399
<i>Build anyway.</i>

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:39.571
<i>Give the world
the best you have</i>

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:42.821
<i>and you'll be kicked
into the teeth.</i>

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:45.995
<i>Give the world
the best you've got anyway.</i>
