Boy, everybody's here.

01:08.046 --> 01:09.421
Why do you think
we're gathering?

01:09.548 --> 01:12.007
This isn't about the soiled
pants in the toilet, right?

01:12.092 --> 01:13.258
'cause I hadn't heard
about that.

01:13.343 --> 01:14.843
Good morning, employees.

01:14.928 --> 01:16.845
As some of you can tell
by my face,

01:16.930 --> 01:18.263
I have some exciting news.

01:18.348 --> 01:20.974
But first, a pair of husky-size
green pants were found

01:21.059 --> 01:23.435
In the men's room,
positively destroyed.

01:23.562 --> 01:25.145
(whispers): That's what
I hadn't heard about.

01:25.272 --> 01:26.813
Now the exciting news.

01:26.899 --> 01:29.149
The brewery is transitioning
to an open floor plan

01:29.234 --> 01:31.860
And will be called
the pawtucket patriot campus.

01:31.945 --> 01:34.696
To help explain the transition
to our futuristic workplace,

01:34.823 --> 01:36.740
I'd like to share a video
from our investor,

01:36.825 --> 01:39.951
The confusingly charismatic
wework lunatic.

01:40.078 --> 01:42.245
<i> Hey, I'm the guy from wework.</i>

01:42.372 --> 01:44.206
<i> My foremost goal is</i>
<i> to facilitate</i>

01:44.333 --> 01:46.875
<i> An experiential bandwidth</i>
<i> of synergy.</i>

01:46.960 --> 01:48.960
<i> Hammock desks,</i>
<i> scooter desks,</i>

01:49.046 --> 01:51.254
<i>And the world's first desk-desk.</i>

01:51.423 --> 01:54.257
<i> The only desk that</i>
<i> functions as a working desk.</i>

01:54.343 --> 01:57.302
<i>I have been the wework lunatic,</i>
<i> please don't google me.</i>

01:57.387 --> 01:59.638
Our new office will also have

01:59.723 --> 02:01.640
A lady chef
who only makes vegan food,

02:01.725 --> 02:04.142
Pinball machines,
and nursing pods.

02:04.228 --> 02:07.145
Lastly, as we transition
to our new open floor plan,

02:07.231 --> 02:08.521
The brewery will be closed

02:08.649 --> 02:10.273
For the next two months
for construction.

02:10.317 --> 02:11.399
Yes, griffin?

02:11.526 --> 02:15.403
Are the nursing pods,
l-like, for anyone?

02:19.326 --> 02:21.243
If I ordered
a whole cornish game hen,

02:21.328 --> 02:22.369
Would anyone have any?

02:22.454 --> 02:24.287
I'm in for a wing.
What's the occasion?

02:24.414 --> 02:26.248
I just found out
the brewery's closing

02:26.333 --> 02:27.916
So they can turn it into
the kind of workplace

02:28.001 --> 02:29.793
You only see on tv shows.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.544
Work's been crazy for me, too.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.797
We have this case--
guy died on his birthday,

02:33.882 --> 02:35.340
And-- get this--
his family had gotten him

02:35.425 --> 02:36.508
An ice cream cake.

02:36.593 --> 02:38.510
You know, the kind
with ice cream inside

02:38.595 --> 02:39.719
As the cake part?

02:39.846 --> 02:41.513
(laughs)

02:41.598 --> 02:44.182
Wild stuff.
So I'm at the scene...

02:44.268 --> 02:46.142
This story is already
too complicated and boring.

02:46.228 --> 02:47.310
Peter, take over.

02:47.396 --> 02:49.020
My amazon guy
once delivered batteries

02:49.147 --> 02:51.314
-To pat sajak.
-No way!

02:51.358 --> 02:53.566
How did he know there were
batteries in the box?

02:53.735 --> 02:55.068
You know,
whenever they ship a battery,

02:55.195 --> 02:56.987
They got to put that little
warning label on the box?

02:57.114 --> 02:58.571
That's how.

02:58.699 --> 03:00.532
It could've just been something
with a battery in it.

03:00.659 --> 03:02.492
No, he said
he shook it real hard.

03:02.661 --> 03:04.494
I-I think
the focus of this story is

03:04.579 --> 03:06.705
More pat sajak than
the battery part.

03:06.832 --> 03:10.458
Hold on. There's no way
that story was better than mine.

03:12.462 --> 03:14.629
Hey, brian. What's all this?

03:14.715 --> 03:16.381
Oh, just following
in the rich tradition

03:16.466 --> 03:18.008
Of hemingway and faulkner

03:18.126 --> 03:19.718
And putting a little damage
on the old liver.

03:19.845 --> 03:21.136
Another rosé, brian?

03:21.263 --> 03:22.512
Put a spritz on it.

03:22.597 --> 03:26.299
So, is, uh, watching tiktoks
of underage girls

03:26.351 --> 03:28.351
Also part of
your writing process?

03:28.437 --> 03:31.604
The best writing happens when
you're not actually writing.

03:31.732 --> 03:33.648
I just wish
my muse would speak to me.

03:33.734 --> 03:36.484
I'm having a tough time finding
an idea for my next novel.

03:36.653 --> 03:39.988
Well, I'd tell you about
one of my murder cases,

03:40.073 --> 03:42.365
But apparently
I'm a bad storyteller.

03:42.492 --> 03:45.368
-Murder case?
-Oh, yeah, we had one last year.

03:45.495 --> 03:47.662
All signs pointed
to the husband.

03:47.748 --> 03:49.414
-What happened?
-It was the husband.

03:49.499 --> 03:51.958
You know, we have
a whole file of cases in quahog

03:52.044 --> 03:53.960
That would make great stories.

03:54.087 --> 03:56.379
A lot of murdered women
out there, bri.

03:56.465 --> 03:58.590
Half of them named britney,
half of them named lacey.

03:58.675 --> 04:01.134
That's one piece of advice
I always give young parents:

04:01.261 --> 04:02.927
Don't name them
britney or lacey.

04:03.013 --> 04:04.137
Yeah, sad stuff.

04:04.264 --> 04:06.097
You know, true crime is huge
right now.

04:06.183 --> 04:07.599
You could be
sitting on a gold mine.

04:07.642 --> 04:09.059
A gold mine, huh?

04:09.144 --> 04:12.354
And this whole day I thought
it was just a smushed dook.

04:14.941 --> 04:17.150
<i> Announcer (on tv):</i>
<i> We now return to</i>
curb your enthusiasm,

04:17.235 --> 04:20.612
<i> Where jeff garlin just repeats</i>
<i> everything larry says.</i>

04:20.739 --> 04:22.530
<i> So, I put on the shirt.</i>

04:22.699 --> 04:24.449
<i> You put on the shirt!</i>

04:24.576 --> 04:25.867
<i> I paid for it.</i>

04:25.952 --> 04:27.535
<i> You paid for it!</i>

04:27.704 --> 04:29.954
<i> I'm starting to think</i>
<i> you're, uh,</i>

04:30.082 --> 04:31.998
<i> The weakest link in the cast.</i>

04:32.084 --> 04:34.542
<i> Easily the weakest link!</i>

04:34.628 --> 04:37.253
Peter, the bank called
to say we're overdrawn,

04:37.381 --> 04:39.255
And the credit card company
sent us a letter

04:39.383 --> 04:41.508
That just says:
"bitch better have my money."

04:41.593 --> 04:42.759
Visa sent that?

04:42.886 --> 04:44.511
God, they can do
whatever they want in delaware.

04:44.596 --> 04:46.471
Thanks for nothing, sleepy joe.

04:46.598 --> 04:49.265
I wonder if this has anything
to do with me not getting paid

04:49.351 --> 04:50.975
During the brewery renovations.

04:51.103 --> 04:53.311
Wh-what do you mean
"not getting paid"?

04:53.397 --> 04:55.146
Well, preston said
we're all transitioning

04:55.190 --> 04:56.856
To being
independent contractors.

04:56.942 --> 04:58.900
The downside is we're losing
our health insurance,

04:58.985 --> 05:01.861
But there's gonna be a pinball
machine in the break room.

05:01.947 --> 05:03.738
Peter, we can't afford
to go two months

05:03.824 --> 05:05.365
Without your paycheck.

05:05.450 --> 05:07.617
You're gonna have to
find a job in the meantime.

05:07.702 --> 05:10.578
Lois, don't worry.
I got it all figured out.

05:10.705 --> 05:13.164
(shoes tapping)

05:21.800 --> 05:23.925
"dear mr. Griffin,
we regret to inform you

05:24.094 --> 05:26.177
That we cannot offer you
a space."

05:27.264 --> 05:30.432
-(shoes tapping)
-(singsongy): Another big
dance check in the mail.

05:30.517 --> 05:34.269
I was just five years away
from three figures a month.

05:34.396 --> 05:36.563
(shoes tapping slowly)

05:41.945 --> 05:43.069
Joe, this stuff is great.

05:43.196 --> 05:45.363
Yep, one man's murdered,
estranged wife

05:45.449 --> 05:46.948
Is another man's treasure.

05:47.033 --> 05:50.243
Brian, I'm gonna have to ask you
to put down the severed limb.

05:50.370 --> 05:51.828
I brought this from home.

05:51.955 --> 05:53.788
Drop it. Drop it!

05:53.874 --> 05:56.958
Ah, damn it, you said "drop it,"
so now I got to drop it.

05:57.085 --> 05:59.836
You know, we should team up
and write a true crime novel.

05:59.963 --> 06:01.087
You don't happen to have
any cases

06:01.173 --> 06:02.964
Featuring pretty blonde women,
do you?

06:03.133 --> 06:04.507
No, those get solved
pretty quickly.

06:04.634 --> 06:07.719
This victim was brunette
and a little heavy.

06:07.846 --> 06:09.304
Okay, getting warmer.

06:09.389 --> 06:12.140
We'll just change a few
key details so people care.

06:12.225 --> 06:14.142
Gutierrez?
Nope, gordon.

06:14.260 --> 06:16.102
Murdered on
an indian reservation?

06:16.188 --> 06:17.479
Let's try beverly hills.

06:17.647 --> 06:20.315
I'm thinking we go novel,
podcast, docuseries,

06:20.400 --> 06:22.233
Then full-blown blockbuster.

06:22.319 --> 06:25.028
But we'd also be doing this
for the families, right?

06:25.113 --> 06:26.521
Is that a new
streaming platform?

06:26.573 --> 06:28.281
No, like, the families
of the victims?

06:28.366 --> 06:29.532
Oh, right. Yeah, sure.

06:29.743 --> 06:32.118
In fact, we'll give them
a sliver of the proceeds.

06:32.287 --> 06:34.245
And I'll give
the fictional version

06:34.331 --> 06:35.830
Of their daughter bigger boobs.

06:35.957 --> 06:37.499
Like-like real heavy naturals.

06:37.542 --> 06:40.793
Oh, yeah, that sounds
like a good compromise.

06:44.716 --> 06:46.424
Your special cart, mrs. G.

06:46.510 --> 06:49.052
Just gave the wheels
a fresh coat of wd-40.

06:49.137 --> 06:51.429
Why, thank you, james.

06:52.599 --> 06:55.808
Oh, roberto, if you weren't
missing half an arm,

06:55.936 --> 06:57.227
I'd definitely consider it.

06:57.312 --> 06:59.854
Oh, how's the 6029s today, hmm?

06:59.981 --> 07:02.232
Oh, mrs. Lois, very fresh.

07:02.317 --> 07:03.983
What's she talking about, mommy?

07:04.110 --> 07:05.818
(laughs) kale, dear.

07:05.904 --> 07:08.446
It's insider speak for kale.

07:14.162 --> 07:15.954
That can't possibly be a thing.

07:16.039 --> 07:18.581
Let me just find someone
to make sure.

07:21.002 --> 07:24.295
Oh, looks like someone
got pulled from the night shift

07:24.381 --> 07:27.090
'cause I've never seen
this free sample.

07:28.510 --> 07:30.802

I love it here!

09:46.110 --> 09:47.944
I don't love
that you got one here.

09:48.029 --> 09:49.403
Don't worry.
You won't even know I'm here.

09:49.530 --> 09:50.947
Unless you're
near the front door,

09:51.032 --> 09:52.782
Which I can open
with the force.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.951
Excuse me,
where are the peanuts?

09:55.036 --> 09:56.369
Aisle seven.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.454
Peter, peanuts are on aisle two.

09:58.539 --> 09:59.705
Eh, I just tell 'em
whatever number,

09:59.791 --> 10:02.250
And then I disappear
into the produce mist.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.544
Peter? Peter?

10:05.630 --> 10:10.466
Peter (echoing):
There was never peter,
only loose carrots.

10:13.263 --> 10:16.222
The body was discovered
around 9:00 p.M.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.183
Unfortunately, I couldn't
make it down to the crime scene

10:19.269 --> 10:20.726
Because there were no ramps.

10:20.812 --> 10:22.186
Okay, I'm gonna write:

10:22.272 --> 10:24.146
"tonight,
all the streets in this town

10:24.232 --> 10:25.648
Were a dead end."

10:25.733 --> 10:27.191
I never saw the body.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.318
It was cold,
so they sent me on a coffee run.

10:29.445 --> 10:31.487
My lap can
accommodate two trays,

10:31.614 --> 10:33.072
And I can't feel the spills.

10:33.199 --> 10:36.158
"she was found in a creek,
her bosoms frozen solid."

10:36.244 --> 10:39.870
She was a heavyset 60-something
in welder's coveralls.

10:39.956 --> 10:42.373
"no one from beverly hills
had ever been strangled

10:42.458 --> 10:44.292
By their own cheerleader skirt
before."

Wow, I can't believe I'm seeing
how the sausage is made.

10:48.798 --> 10:52.216
Hey, so when you open a book
and you see "random house,"

10:52.302 --> 10:54.343
Is that something
we come up with?

10:54.387 --> 10:57.096
Uh, no, that's-that's
the publisher's name.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.307
I see.
Just drinking it all in.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.434
And what about the list of
cities you see under that name?

11:01.519 --> 11:04.895
Because I was thinking we should
put new york, paris, kokomo.

11:04.981 --> 11:07.315
Those are just the cities
where the publisher has offices.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.191
And kokomo isn't
a real city, joe.

11:09.319 --> 11:11.193
Try telling the beach boys that.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.696
I don't know what our title
should be yet, but beneath it,

11:13.781 --> 11:16.657
It should say: "soon to be
a major motion picture."

11:16.784 --> 11:18.951
I always buy the book
when I see that.

11:19.037 --> 11:20.453
Why don't we just focus
on the writing?

11:20.580 --> 11:21.912
Oh, hey, you ever see books

11:21.998 --> 11:23.914
Where the edges
of the pages are gold?

11:24.083 --> 11:26.459
-Yeah?
-So cool.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.174
What is going on in here?

11:33.259 --> 11:35.217
Who put price tags
on all the cans?

11:35.303 --> 11:37.553
And why is everything
labeled 69 cents?

11:37.680 --> 11:40.890

<i> from behind a one-way mirror.</i>

12:07.752 --> 12:10.127

12:10.296 --> 12:13.381

-There are gonna be

12:17.136 --> 12:19.011
First off, no more lipstick.

12:19.097 --> 12:21.847
That's how
all this trouble started.

12:26.187 --> 12:27.269
Okay,
so we just need the ending.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.479
Who was the murderer?

12:28.564 --> 12:31.273
Oh, I have no idea.
It's a cold case.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.818
That's what makes 'em cold--
no one knows how to solve 'em.

12:33.903 --> 12:35.069
Well, how do we finish our novel

12:35.154 --> 12:37.530
If we don't know what happened
in real life?

12:37.615 --> 12:39.031
-Ghost cop.
-No.

12:39.117 --> 12:40.157
Do you know what this means?

12:40.284 --> 12:42.159
We're gonna put on
our sherlock holmes hats

12:42.328 --> 12:44.328
And solve the murder ourselves?

12:44.414 --> 12:46.789
Deerstalker hats, joe.
But yes.

12:46.874 --> 12:49.500
Stupid nonwriter!

12:52.338 --> 12:54.246
Okay, brian, now,
when you're visiting

12:54.298 --> 12:55.798
The family of a deceased victim,

12:55.925 --> 12:57.299
You need to hold a hat
over your chest.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.676
It shows you care.

12:58.803 --> 13:00.845
All I have is this crown
from our burger king lunch.

13:00.972 --> 13:02.263
Hat's a hat.

13:03.558 --> 13:06.350
How can I help you,
officer and your highness?

13:06.510 --> 13:10.187
Hi, yes. We're here with many
questions about your daughter.

13:10.273 --> 13:11.981
You know, the dead one?
You-you remember her?

13:12.066 --> 13:13.691
We'd love any details.

13:13.776 --> 13:15.818
Is this some sort of sick joke?

13:15.903 --> 13:17.153
I assure you it's not, ma'am.

13:17.238 --> 13:18.988
We're writing
a future hit novel

13:19.073 --> 13:20.156
Based on your daughter's murder.

13:20.283 --> 13:21.574
We just need to know who did it.

13:21.617 --> 13:24.285
And, between us, it'd be great
if one of you did.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.036
What is this?
What do you want?

13:26.122 --> 13:27.913
Did you know
jonbenét ramsey's dad

13:27.999 --> 13:30.541
Dated natalee holloway's mom?

13:30.626 --> 13:32.126
What does that have to do
with our case?

13:32.211 --> 13:34.044
Well, nothing,
it's just kind of weird, right?

13:34.130 --> 13:37.089
Do you happen to have
any grainy video footage

13:37.175 --> 13:40.176
Of her singing an emotional song
at a talent show?

13:40.261 --> 13:41.677
Maybe green day's
"time of your life"?

13:41.804 --> 13:44.680
That would really bust
this project wide open for us.

13:44.849 --> 13:46.807
You're both unwell.

13:48.269 --> 13:49.643
Well, that was a bust.

13:49.770 --> 13:52.354
Sorry, I've been holding this in
since burger king.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.315
Oh, seriously? You're just
gonna leave that there?

13:54.442 --> 13:57.109
These people have suffered
a terrible loss.

13:57.236 --> 13:59.361

or something.

13:59.530 --> 14:00.863
Ugh, fine.

14:04.535 --> 14:06.202
Joe, look.
I found something.

14:07.163 --> 14:09.580
-It's a key to a storage unit.
-How do you know that?

14:09.665 --> 14:12.124
Yeah, me and bonnie have been
doing a fun role-play thing

14:12.251 --> 14:14.168
Where she dresses up
like a sexy maid

14:14.253 --> 14:17.379
And then locks me in a storage
unit while guys come over.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.340
-Oh.
-Yeah, it's pretty kinky.

14:19.467 --> 14:22.426
I, uh, I play the role of
a sexy armoire,

14:22.512 --> 14:24.011
Waiting in another room.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.889
Sounds like she just wants you
out of the house for a while.

14:26.974 --> 14:29.308
Nah. No.

14:34.315 --> 14:36.357

-What a mouth on that kid.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.552
Um, excuse me, miss, did you
just yell at this employee?

15:04.679 --> 15:06.053
You're damn right I did.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.180
He has no business being here.

15:08.266 --> 15:10.808
This man is a member

15:10.935 --> 15:13.018
He has every business
being here.

15:13.104 --> 15:15.187
You, on the other hand,
will have to go.

15:15.314 --> 15:16.480
You're banned from the store.

15:16.566 --> 15:18.190
(chuckles nervously):
What? No.

15:18.317 --> 15:19.483
Y-you can't do this.

Who actually believed
in my writing.

21:43.736 --> 21:47.530
Well, as someone who's never
read a book, I absolutely do.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.287
The waitress from the clam!
Holy crap, has lois seen you?!

21:54.372 --> 21:55.413
We really don't have
an arrangement.

21:55.540 --> 21:56.414
You got to get out of here!

21:56.541 --> 21:57.957
Oh, peter, enough.

21:58.042 --> 22:00.251
-What's the matter?
-You wouldn't understand.

22:00.295 --> 22:02.587
Okay.

22:03.965 --> 22:06.007
I'd get back in there, chief.

22:07.176 --> 22:09.719
(sighs) chris made me come back.

22:09.804 --> 22:11.971
Oh, honey,
the grocery store isn't just

22:12.056 --> 22:14.098
Where I buy food for the family.

22:14.183 --> 22:15.433
It's my escape.

22:15.518 --> 22:17.685
My refuge
from being pestered

22:17.770 --> 22:19.186
With dumb questions
from the kids,

22:19.272 --> 22:20.938
Or having to clean up
your messes.

22:21.065 --> 22:24.275
Sometimes, just a stroll
down the ethnic food aisle

22:24.360 --> 22:26.819
Makes me feel like
I'm in a north african bazaar.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.821
Yeah, I don't like the smells
on that aisle.

22:28.990 --> 22:32.158
-And I don't know,
it's hard to explain, but...
-There's more?!

22:32.243 --> 22:34.827
It's not just
a grocery store to me.

22:34.912 --> 22:36.996
There's a whole
community of people there

22:37.081 --> 22:38.497
Who feel like family.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.958
And now,
now I have nothing.

22:41.044 --> 22:45.171
Aw, lois, I'm so sorry
for ruining your happy place.

22:45.256 --> 22:47.006
And I'm gonna take care of it.

22:47.091 --> 22:49.425
Just like I've been taking care
of that egg since high school.

22:49.594 --> 22:52.386
Oh, my god, I forgot to pick
him up from soccer practice!

22:53.306 --> 22:56.349
Hey, do you need me
to call your yolks?

22:59.145 --> 23:00.728
Look, you got to let lois
come back.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.147
Please remove the ban.
She loves this place.

23:03.232 --> 23:04.398
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.859
She yelled at
a mentally-challenged person,

23:06.944 --> 23:07.985
And that's unforgivable.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.528
What?
I'm not mentally challenged.

23:09.614 --> 23:11.447
You're not?
But that's literally

23:11.532 --> 23:13.407
The only reason we hired you.

23:13.451 --> 23:16.911
Would a mentally challenged
person be able to do this?

23:21.125 --> 23:23.459
Your name tag says "big petey."

23:23.544 --> 23:25.544
(scoffs) why do you think
we all gather round

23:25.672 --> 23:27.296
And applaud you while you ride

23:27.340 --> 23:28.923
The coin-operated horse
out front?

23:29.008 --> 23:30.257
'cause I'm good at horses?

23:30.343 --> 23:32.677
Wow. (chuckles)
I really thought...

23:32.762 --> 23:35.054
You know, we don't let
all our employees insist

23:35.181 --> 23:37.932
The customers feel their muscles
after bagging their order.

23:37.975 --> 23:39.183
Right?

23:39.310 --> 23:40.351
Okay, fine.

23:40.478 --> 23:42.311
Lois can come back,
but you're fired.

23:42.397 --> 23:44.146
I need you to turn in
your gun and badge.

23:44.315 --> 23:46.732
Well, I guess
my work here is done.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.526
To the mickey-copter!

23:51.197 --> 23:52.321
See, disney?

23:52.407 --> 23:54.490
Nothing here
but respectful synergy.
