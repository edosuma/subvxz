WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:05.100
the spring of 2008 was complicated time in you old man's life.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.790
The last time I had seen Barney

00:07.800 --> 00:09.700
was shortly after I found out he has spent night with Robbin.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.600
Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?

00:13.300 --> 00:14.900
I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.400
It's Barney.

00:20.100 --> 00:23.000
Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.200
Ted I'm sorry, I haven't returned your calls.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.000
Yeah I never called you,

00:27.010 --> 00:29.300
you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.600
I'm sorry, I gotta let you go.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
It's just too many good wingmen out there.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.800
Ted, are you crying?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.200
No, I am not.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.000
Sh....let it out, let it out.

00:43.100 --> 00:44.700
Goodbye Barney.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.500
-So are you two back together?  -No.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.200
I miss Barney.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.400
I haven't "high five" with anyone like a week.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.500
I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.000
Let me asking you something Ted.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Why are you so much madder at Barney than me.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.300
Yeah, She had just as much sex with barney

01:02.300 --> 01:03.800
as barney had with her.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.800
You know what? I'm not sure that's true.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.000
I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. 

01:10.000 --> 01:12.200
This is too wierd.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.000
I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. 

01:15.000 --> 01:17.300
And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. That's simple.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.400
I will tell you why he is not mad. 

01:19.400 --> 01:21.400
Because he is so happy with stella.

01:21.410 --> 01:22.400
She was right.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.900
Stella and I had been dating for two months.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.200
And things were going really well.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.000
She had mat my friends in past for flying colors.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.000
There was just one little problem.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.700
You guys haven't had sex yet?!

01:34.800 --> 01:36.600
When marshall and I were two months. 

01:36.600 --> 01:38.600
We were doing it 24/7.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.900
I know. I was in the top bunk.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.200
Also sat next to you at football games.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.500
So what you guys waiting for?

01:45.600 --> 01:47.900
I... She wants to make sure we are serious first, 

01:47.900 --> 01:49.900
that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.700
She wants to take things slow.

01:51.700 --> 01:56.000
Wait, So you haven't had sex since like Thanks Giving.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.400
Do you know how many big federal holidays

01:59.400 --> 02:01.400
have come and gone since then.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.200
Oh, baby, Do you remember Martin Luther King Day

02:04.900 --> 02:08.699
Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.400
Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, 

02:11.400 --> 02:13.400
I'm fine with that.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.300
And totally unrelated note. 

02:15.300 --> 02:16.800
Does anybody have gamma icer

02:16.800 --> 02:18.300
or a piece of bark that you are not chewing.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.500
Hey Barney, new sky mall came in.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.300
So Worldaround blog's fear is 

02:31.300 --> 02:33.500
you are looking for a new wingman. 

02:33.500 --> 02:35.500
I wanna let you know, I am available.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.500
Just say the word, or don't even say the word. 

02:38.500 --> 02:40.900
Just do something with your eyebrow.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.400
Was that it?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.400
No offence Randy, 

02:47.400 --> 02:50.400
but there is long list of candidates for this slot.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.800
The slot is vice president of awosome.

02:53.400 --> 02:57.300
And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.000
Assistant under secretary of only ok

03:02.300 --> 03:04.300
Thank you, I will not let you down.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.100
So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.600
-Pitt, Barney Stinson. -Hey

03:09.600 --> 03:11.500

03:13.200 --> 03:14.600

03:14.600 --> 03:17.600
You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. 

03:17.600 --> 03:18.900
Just had a baby daughter.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.400
So What do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.400
Starry Porten, Barney stinson.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.600
What up, chef.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.500
I need a new bro, what do you say?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Dude, I'd love to, But now I'm bro with Duck Stan.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.700
Oh, I understand.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.400
Duck Stan is a good bro.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.900
I'm happy for you. Best of luck.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.800
Crazy Willie. Barney Stinson.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.100
What up B dog, long time no bro, 

03:50.100 --> 03:52.100
so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?

03:52.300 --> 03:53.600
Yes Finally.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.600
Here is what on the rocket tocket.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.700
My wife is gonna put cheese out at seven.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.000
9pm we watch 27 dresses. 

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Everybody is home by 11:00. Booya.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.400
-Hello  -Hanging up on you once wasn't enough.

04:13.060 --> 04:15.560
So I lanced this thing  on this guy's back,

04:15.630 --> 04:18.329
and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was,

04:18.399 --> 04:20.000
and then it exploded like a volcano.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.329
Pus everywhere.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.000
Let's have sex.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.330
Right now.I'll lock the door.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.200
Oh, there's no lock on that door.

04:26.260 --> 04:28.400
We can do it against the door.It'll be hot!

04:28.460 --> 04:31.460
It'll be like a three-way: you, me, and the door.

04:31.530 --> 04:33.200
Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird

04:33.260 --> 04:34.730
between me and the door tomorrow.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.800
I'm sorry.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.930
We're waiting. It's cool.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.700
 You've been so patient, Ted.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.200
The truth is...

04:45.260 --> 04:46.400
I'm kind of nervous.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.700
 I have a confession to make.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.760
 I was afraid of this.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.060
You're 14.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.200
 No, um...

04:54.260 --> 04:57.860
It's kind of embarrassing,but it's been a while

04:57.930 --> 04:59.860
since I was intimate with anyone.

04:59.930 --> 05:01.930
Wow, it's funny that you say that.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.730
Me, too.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.230
Really?

05:05.300 --> 05:06.760
How long's it been for you?

05:07.900 --> 05:09.560
It's been a while.

05:09.630 --> 05:10.930
Tell me.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.260
Me, too!

05:15.330 --> 05:18.400
 It's been five months  for you, too?

05:18.460 --> 05:20.600
Five years?!

05:35.400 --> 05:36.700
Wow.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.860
Stella hasn't had  sex since 2003.

05:38.930 --> 05:40.660
Let's put this in context.

05:40.730 --> 05:43.600
The last time Stella had sex,the movie, <i>Seabiscuit,</i>

05:43.660 --> 05:47.160
had just galloped into theaters... and our hearts.

05:48.330 --> 05:49.930
Five years?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.900
 God, if I even went <i>one</i> year,

05:51.960 --> 05:54.700
I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.

05:55.660 --> 05:57.330
The last time Stella had sex,

05:57.400 --> 06:00.060
the world was just learning about SARS.

06:00.130 --> 06:01.730
Well, Ted, what else did she say?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.960
Did she give you any kind of explanation?

06:04.030 --> 06:07.000
Look, after Lucy was born,I dated a little,

06:07.060 --> 06:09.030
 but it was hard to find a guy  I could trust enough.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.900
Sooner or later, every one of them

06:10.960 --> 06:12.300
gave me a reason not to.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.660
  But nobody in five years?

06:15.730 --> 06:19.100
Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.330
Girls regret the guys  they <i>do</i> sleep with.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.460
And for the past  five years,

06:23.530 --> 06:25.000
 I've had no regrets.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.360
Ted, you're staring at my boobs.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.100
In my defense,   they were staring at me.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.530
So what does this mean for you?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.500
Is she ever gonna want to get intimate?

06:37.560 --> 06:38.760
 Actually...

06:38.830 --> 06:40.560
But the truth is,I really do

06:40.630 --> 06:41.900
want to do this with you.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.530
 I don't think  I'd regret it at all.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.860
 Your pillow talk's a little rusty.

06:46.930 --> 06:49.400
You know what I mean, Ted. I'm ready.

06:49.460 --> 06:50.900
 That's great.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.500
Like, "right now" ready?

06:55.360 --> 06:57.330
 So her sister's driving up   to baby-sit Lucy,

06:57.400 --> 07:00.530
and we're getting a hotel room  in the city Saturday night.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.230
The last time  Stella had sex,

07:02.300 --> 07:04.200
<i>The Da Vinci Code</i>  had just come out.

07:04.260 --> 07:05.900
Well, that doesn't seem  like that long ago.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.100
Not the movie, the book.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.930
 Wow.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.300
It's a lot of pressure,   isn't it?

07:11.360 --> 07:13.300
You know what? It's not.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.730
This woman needs it bad.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.660
Anything you do is going to be fireworks.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.800
I remember my longest drought...

07:19.860 --> 07:22.430
  <i>It was that summer I lived</i>   <i>in San Francisco.</i>

07:22.500 --> 07:26.530
 <i>I hadn't had been with Marshall</i>   <i>in two months and 19 days.</i>

07:35.530 --> 07:38.700
Oh, San Francisco.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.700
I don't know, Lily,after five years,

07:40.760 --> 07:42.760
her expectations  have gotta be pretty high.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.460
 Notable deaths  in 2003...

07:46.530 --> 07:50.930
Oh, my God...   Nell Carter.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.460
Did you guys know  that Nell Carter had died?

07:55.130 --> 07:57.460
I'm really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.

07:57.530 --> 07:59.900
 Yeah, it'll be pretty hard  now that she's dead.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.130
Not Nell Carter-- Stella.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.500
Dude, relax.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.300
It's all about expectations management.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.400
Do you know why I hated <i>Jerry Maguire</i> so much?

08:06.460 --> 08:08.200
 Because you're dead inside?

08:08.260 --> 08:11.160
No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks,

08:11.230 --> 08:13.100
  saying it was the greatest movie ever.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.230
With Stella, do the opposite:  lower expectations.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.130
Right, right, and then no matter what happens,

08:18.200 --> 08:19.600
she'll be happy

08:21.860 --> 08:23.600
 Hey, buddy.

08:23.660 --> 08:27.600
I'm married, Barney.I cannot be your new wingman.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.460
No.

08:39.330 --> 08:40.960
Hey, Randy.

08:41.030 --> 08:43.159
Could you come in here for a minute?

08:45.030 --> 08:46.300
 Good news.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.830
 I'm calling you up to the majors.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.830
Starting tomorrow night,

08:49.900 --> 08:52.330
 how would you like  to be my new wingman?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.200
Uh...

08:54.260 --> 08:57.800
Just need to check my calendar. Be right back.

09:21.230 --> 09:22.330
Tomorrow works.

09:25.630 --> 09:28.400
I have a surprise appetizer for us today.

09:28.460 --> 09:29.730
Check it out.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.260
Potato skins.

09:31.260 --> 09:32.400
Fancy.

09:32.460 --> 09:33.730
Yeah, right?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.630
God, it's been forever since I had potato skins.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.900
I remember them as being

09:36.960 --> 09:39.330
 pretty much the most delicious things ever.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.300
Huh.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.860
That's surprising.

09:44.930 --> 09:46.560
What?

09:46.630 --> 09:47.730
This potato skin.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.960
It's good

09:48.960 --> 09:52.360
but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.560
Even though this potato skin performed admirably,

09:55.630 --> 09:58.600
and is a totally respectable size...

09:59.760 --> 10:01.330
I couldn't enjoy it

10:01.400 --> 10:03.760
because of my own unrealistic expectations.

10:03.830 --> 10:05.930
Hmm, Ted, I see  what you're doing.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.200
You're trying to lower

10:07.200 --> 10:09.100
 my expectations for tonight.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.230
-Is this a length thing?  -No.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.200
-Quick on the draw?  -No.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.660
-Unexpected number of testicles?  -No!

10:15.730 --> 10:18.260
It's just that this is a big deal for you.

10:18.330 --> 10:20.060
I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel.

10:21.460 --> 10:23.830
Virginity 2: Electric Boogaloo?

10:23.900 --> 10:25.900
Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.430
I don't want you to ever wonder if I was worth it.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.860
Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it.

10:31.930 --> 10:34.330
Stop worrying.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.830
It's you and me.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.560
It already has everything it needs.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.100
"Unexpected number of testicles?"

10:44.160 --> 10:46.330
It happens. I knew a guy in med school...

10:46.400 --> 10:49.630
We used to joke that he was one ball away from getting walked.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.700
Hey.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.730
What up, Bro-seph Lieberman?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.330
No, uh-uh.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.760
Randy, we never use  the word "bro" in the name

11:02.860 --> 11:05.630
of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.

11:07.630 --> 11:11.130
Good-bye, "Geraldine Ferrar-bro."

11:11.200 --> 11:13.060
You know what?

11:13.130 --> 11:15.100
I'm excited  about this, Randy.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.400
You will be my next masterpiece.

11:17.460 --> 11:18.400
It's like with Ted.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.860
 When I first met him,

11:19.930 --> 11:21.230
he was an even bigger loser than you.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.200
What a loser.

11:23.260 --> 11:25.500
But tonight, I am going  to make you

11:25.560 --> 11:29.760
the greatest wingman  in the history of wingmen.

11:29.830 --> 11:32.400
Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.630
Yeah, I've been reading  your blog for years.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.260
  You are like a god to me.

11:36.330 --> 11:39.200
That's why tonight is going to be legendary...

11:39.260 --> 11:41.200
wait for it...

11:41.260 --> 11:43.360
dary.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.160
Okay, Randy, let's do this.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.760
Okay.

11:51.830 --> 11:53.200
You ready?

11:53.260 --> 11:54.230
Yes.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

11:56.260 --> 11:58.360
What? What's  the matter?

11:58.430 --> 12:00.330
Nothing.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.260
Let's do this.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.100
No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.760
Just wait. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait!

12:05.830 --> 12:08.000
Randy, what are  you doing?

12:08.060 --> 12:10.530
Dripping with game,that's what I'm doing.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.460
Okay, let's go. No. Let's...

12:12.530 --> 12:13.800
Yes. No!

12:13.860 --> 12:16.400
Randy, listen to me: you can do this, okay?

12:16.460 --> 12:18.960
Oh, I don't know. Are those girls really that hot?

12:19.030 --> 12:20.530
Yeah, they're hot. Let's do this.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.600
Okay!

12:24.900 --> 12:26.860
Hey, ladies.

12:26.930 --> 12:29.560
Have you met...

12:35.930 --> 12:37.860
-Hey. -Hey!

12:37.930 --> 12:39.500
So, here's the plan.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.160
Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park,

12:41.230 --> 12:42.730
and it just so happens

12:42.800 --> 12:44.200
-the Philharmonic is playing  an open-air... -Ted.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.660
Five years.

12:45.730 --> 12:46.660
-Straight to the hotel? -Straight to the hotel.

12:46.730 --> 12:49.030
I'll get my bag.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.630
Hey, guys.

12:51.700 --> 12:52.900
Hey. 

12:52.960 --> 12:55.660
So, uh, looking forward to tonight?

12:55.730 --> 12:57.360
Yeah. Definitely.

12:57.430 --> 12:59.200
It's been such a long time since I've had a night out.

12:59.260 --> 13:01.200
Yeah, we heard.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.430
I would explode if it had been that long

13:03.500 --> 13:04.900
since I had a "night out."

13:04.960 --> 13:07.000
This one wakes me up at 4 am sometimes

13:07.060 --> 13:09.600
just to have a little "night out." 

13:09.660 --> 13:12.600
Um, what are you guys talking about?

13:13.630 --> 13:14.900
Nothing.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.100
Pizza.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.160
What are you talking about?

13:18.230 --> 13:20.300
Hey, guys.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.800
Ted, you told them,  didn't you?

13:22.860 --> 13:23.900
Told them what?

13:23.960 --> 13:25.400
You told them

13:25.460 --> 13:28.030
that I haven't had  sex in five years.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.730
You haven't had sex in five years?!

13:32.800 --> 13:34.130
That is a shocking revelation

13:34.200 --> 13:35.360
that we're just finding out right now!

13:42.700 --> 13:43.800
Stella, I'm sorry.

13:43.860 --> 13:45.160
I shouldn't have told them.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.100
But they're my best friends. I tell them everything.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.430
I-I didn't even think about it.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.230
Ted, that was so personal.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.260
Plus, now your friends  think I'm a freak.

13:53.330 --> 13:54.560
No, they don't.

13:54.630 --> 13:56.860
Look, I realize it's weird, okay?

13:56.930 --> 13:59.130
Not many people go five years without having sex.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.860
13 years?!

14:00.930 --> 14:03.760
I peaked really young.

14:03.830 --> 14:05.600
That's why it was difficult  for me to tell you.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.930
But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.230
You can trust me.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.630
Obviously, I can't.

14:12.130 --> 14:14.500
You know, there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy,

14:14.560 --> 14:16.360
and you just gave me yours.

14:16.430 --> 14:18.100
Wait, did I give you a reason,

14:18.100 --> 14:19.960
or were you looking for one?

14:20.030 --> 14:22.960
Why would be looking for one?

14:23.030 --> 14:24.960
 Because things are getting  serious between us,

14:25.030 --> 14:26.760
and that scares you.

14:30.530 --> 14:32.530
Good night, Ted.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.030
Okay, Randy, now,

14:37.100 --> 14:38.630
tell me, without looking at your hand,

14:39.860 --> 14:41.160
are the three beginner techniques

14:41.230 --> 14:42.800
for picking up a woman at a bar?

14:42.860 --> 14:44.860
Isolate her from her friends;

14:44.930 --> 14:47.200
repeat her name in conversation;

14:47.260 --> 14:49.230
subtly put her down.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.530
Excellent.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.300
 Now...

14:52.360 --> 14:53.700
let's put those to use.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.730
  I'm right  behind you.

15:01.430 --> 15:02.860
Hi, I'm Randy.

15:02.930 --> 15:03.930
What's your name?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.030
Haley.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.300
Haley.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.630
Haley, that's a pretty name, Haley.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.200
Haley...

15:09.260 --> 15:10.930
come here, Haley.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.430
Um... okay.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.530
Haley, you are a fat ugly whore.

15:24.260 --> 15:26.000
I'm sorry, Barney.

15:26.060 --> 15:27.860
Eh, so you got a drink thrown in your face.

15:27.930 --> 15:29.460
Happens to me all the time.

15:29.530 --> 15:31.000
Pretty soon you'll be  able to anticipate it,

15:31.060 --> 15:33.100
and when you do?  Free drink.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.430
We got two live ones.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.060
New plan: this time follow my lead.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.460
Evening, ladies.

15:43.530 --> 15:45.530
Oh, I like your broach.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.700
What is that?

15:46.760 --> 15:48.400
Oh, it's a koala bear.

15:48.460 --> 15:49.700
I think they're adorable.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.300
No way!

15:51.360 --> 15:53.360
My friend randy here is the leading expert

15:53.430 --> 15:55.360
On koala bears in australia!

15:55.430 --> 15:57.360
He's in town working with the bronx zoo.

15:57.430 --> 15:58.400
You are?

15:58.460 --> 16:01.430
That is so Cool!

16:01.500 --> 16:03.830
Okay, what is your favorite thing about koala bears?

16:05.860 --> 16:08.860
Their...

16:10.360 --> 16:13.860
Meat is delicious.

16:17.330 --> 16:18.430
I'm sorry, barney.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.600
Ah, it's okay.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.760
New plan: We need to get you comfortable

16:22.830 --> 16:25.000
Just saying words to women.

16:25.060 --> 16:27.000
Now, there's no reason to be nervous,

16:27.060 --> 16:29.000
Because my friend, robin, has agreed to help out.

16:29.060 --> 16:31.330
Because you threatened to put a video of us on the internet,

16:31.400 --> 16:32.830
Which I'm still not convinced you have.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.700
Right, which is why you came all the way

16:34.760 --> 16:36.700
From brooklyn at midnight.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.130
Now randy,

16:38.200 --> 16:40.130
Let's keep it Simple.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.530
Just start by introducing Yourself.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.030
Hi.

16:44.100 --> 16:44.960
My name's randy.

16:45.030 --> 16:46.130
Hi, randy.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.500
How are you?

16:47.560 --> 16:48.630
I'm good. how are you?

16:48.700 --> 16:50.460
-Good, thank you. -great.

16:50.530 --> 16:51.800
You're doing really, really well.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.800
Now ask her what she's doing later.

16:53.860 --> 16:55.830
What are you doing later?

16:55.900 --> 16:59.160
Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.800
Oh, god.

17:01.860 --> 17:03.630
This happens every time I get an erection.

17:03.700 --> 17:04.829
I am so sorry.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.260
Okay.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.300
Okay, new plan.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.900
We wrap his face in gauze  so he can't bleed or talk.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.329
You are the woman...

17:15.400 --> 17:18.500
Barney, why are you so desperate to have this happen?

17:18.560 --> 17:19.760
I'm a wingman.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.130
That's what wingmen do.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.829
Is it possible

17:22.900 --> 17:25.130
That you're trying to fill the void of losing ted

17:25.200 --> 17:27.800
By rushing into a new wingman relationship?

17:27.859 --> 17:29.300
What are you saying?

17:29.360 --> 17:32.660
I'm saying that randy is your rebound bro.

17:32.730 --> 17:34.130
No.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.630
That's crazy.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.630
What randy and I have is real.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.000
No, it's not, barney.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.030
And even if you got randy laid tonight,

17:42.100 --> 17:44.860
Would it feel anywhere near as meaningful

17:44.930 --> 17:46.360
As when you got ted laid?

17:46.430 --> 17:49.700
He was just so happy the next morning, you know?

17:49.760 --> 17:50.530
I know.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.760
All right.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.130
It hasn't clotted,

17:53.200 --> 17:56.030
But I think it's pretty much draining backwards now.

17:58.060 --> 18:00.060
Randy.

18:00.130 --> 18:02.060
I've been thinking,

18:02.130 --> 18:04.030
Is isn't working out.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.060
Yeah, I figured.

18:06.130 --> 18:08.330
I knew I couldn't fly this close to the sun

18:08.400 --> 18:10.530
Without getting burned.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.030
This is the story of my life.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.530
I always let people down.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.900
You, my dad, the chief.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.100
The chief?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.230
Yeah, I was a cop for like three months.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.730
But I got kicked off the force

18:20.800 --> 18:23.600
Because I screwed up so much I was an insurance liability.

18:23.660 --> 18:26.600
You were a new york city police officer

18:26.660 --> 18:27.860
And you didn't tell me?

18:28.960 --> 18:30.200
Did you ever shoot anybody?

18:30.260 --> 18:31.460
Only all the time.

18:31.530 --> 18:32.730
But not himself.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.430
And not in the foot.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.300
-Actually...   -ah, bah, bah,   bah, bah.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.600
But nothing.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.600
I don't think there's anything hotter than a cop.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.260
Are you okay?

18:41.330 --> 18:42.600
Your nose is bleeding.

18:42.660 --> 18:44.030
Uh, old injury.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.830
The bullet's still lodged in his sinus.

18:45.900 --> 18:46.860
Oh, my god!

18:47.000 --> 18:48.160
You know what?

18:48.230 --> 18:49.400
I live right around the corner.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.830
Can I take you to my place

18:50.900 --> 18:51.960
And fix you up?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.700
That would be very nice.

18:58.730 --> 19:00.530
Have a great time, you two.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.600
Oh, my god, thank you.   I can't thank you enough.

19:05.630 --> 19:08.600
I am the greatest wingman of all time.

19:08.660 --> 19:11.700
Ted doesn't know what he's missing.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.730
You had to mention ted,  didn't you?

19:21.860 --> 19:24.760
Okay, I really overreacted last night.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.930
I'm sorry.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.200
Maybe I have some trust issues,

19:28.260 --> 19:31.330
But believe me, I have earned them.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.500
You said that I was looking for a reason

19:33.560 --> 19:35.500
For this whole thing to fall apart.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.200
Well, you're onto me, ted.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.630
That's actually something that I do a lot.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.930
But I'm not going to do that with you.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.230
Ted... I'm in.

19:49.260 --> 19:50.530
This is awkward.

19:50.600 --> 19:51.860
I have a girl here.

19:51.930 --> 19:52.800
So...

20:00.900 --> 20:02.860
Come on.

20:02.930 --> 20:05.600
There is something that I'm ready to do with you.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.900
Ted, this Lucy.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.900
-Hi, lucy.  -lucy, this is ted.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.900
Stella and I thought our relationship

20:17.960 --> 20:20.230
Was going to take a big step that weekend.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.230
turned out. it even took a bigger one

20:27.530 --> 20:29.330
She's sound asleep.  oh.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.460
She is so great.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.830
I think so.

20:32.860 --> 20:35.560
So, uh, I was thinking,

20:35.630 --> 20:37.630
My sister is in town until tomorrow.

20:37.700 --> 20:40.330
And, uh, there's a motel just down the turnpike.

20:48.430 --> 20:50.400
-Wow, that was amazing!  -oh, yeah.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.730
What are you doing?
