WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.251
<i> Last time</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:05.421
Gordon: You'll be cooking
one next level dish,

00:05.464 --> 00:07.965
and we'll each choose
five of you

00:08.009 --> 00:09.967
to mentor across
this competition.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.427
Whoo! This is not like
cooking at home.

00:11.429 --> 00:14.221
Gordon: My first pick,
that processed meat.

00:14.265 --> 00:16.223
- Welcome to team nyesha.
- Welcome to team blais.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.642
You guys are done for.
I've got my winner.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.227
<i> And tonight...</i>

00:20.271 --> 00:23.063
For today's challenge,
a next-level steak dinner.

00:23.107 --> 00:26.150
- Whoo! Steak down.
- Was that a protein?

00:26.152 --> 00:30.654
The best dish will keep
their entire team safe
from elimination.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.448
Time to bring the heat.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.700
Gordon:
Our bottom two dishes will go
head to head in elimination,

00:34.744 --> 00:36.577
where one of you
will go home.

00:36.579 --> 00:40.164
My reputation
is on the line as well.
I do not want to lose.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.207
- Anything can happen...
- That is raw.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.584
...And it's happening.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.795
- This is not gonna break me.
- ( bleep )

00:46.797 --> 00:50.507
<i> ( theme music playing )</i>

01:05.191 --> 01:08.442
wow, look at those new aprons.

01:08.486 --> 01:10.319
Team ramsay,
are you guys ready to go?

01:10.362 --> 01:13.238
- All: Yes, chef!
- I'm feeling so excited

01:13.282 --> 01:15.115
because I'm on team ramsay.

01:15.117 --> 01:18.410
This makes it, like, "offish."
like, y'all see my apron?

01:18.454 --> 01:23.123
Team nyesha!
Five culinary assassins
looking their very best.

01:23.167 --> 01:26.085
- You guys ready?
- All: Yes, chef.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.252
Are we gonna bring it,
team blais?

01:27.296 --> 01:29.797
- ( cheering )
- yeah!

01:29.799 --> 01:31.799
Now, last week,
you all felt the heat

01:31.801 --> 01:33.967
of those three
incredible kitchens.

01:34.011 --> 01:38.180
But now you each
have an amazing mentor

01:38.224 --> 01:41.350
to take you
through this competition.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.643
Now, throughout the competition,

01:42.645 --> 01:44.520
you all be tested
across all three levels.

01:44.563 --> 01:49.233
<i> Each team will be randomly</i>
<i> assigned a kitchen to cook in.</i>

01:49.276 --> 01:52.152
<i> For each challenge,</i>
<i> we want you to prove</i>

01:52.196 --> 01:54.321
<i> that you can create magic</i>
<i> in any environment,</i>

01:54.365 --> 01:57.157
<i> even when the odds</i>
<i> are stacked against you.</i>

01:57.201 --> 02:02.079
Bottom line is, guys,
put your heart and your soul
into these dishes.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.456
Because in this competition,
just like in real life,

02:04.458 --> 02:07.000
you're only as good
as your last dish.

02:07.035 --> 02:10.420
Listen to this because
it's incredibly important.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.423
The chef who creates
the best dish in this challenge

02:13.467 --> 02:17.136
will keep their entire team
safe from elimination.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.429
- Ooh, please.
- Wow.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.057
- And believe me,
you want to stay safe.
- Yes.

02:22.101 --> 02:24.852
Because after the challenge,
two of you will be sent

02:24.854 --> 02:29.439
into a head to head battle
to determine who's going home.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.151
Reuel:
<i> Time to bring the heat.</i>

02:32.153 --> 02:35.028
I want those other teams
to shake in fear.

02:35.072 --> 02:38.699
I want them to feel that,
hey, chef ramsay's team

02:38.742 --> 02:42.119
is going to be a problem.

02:42.163 --> 02:45.164
Now, for today's challenge,
we're gonna start with something

02:45.207 --> 02:47.499
a next-level chef
should be able to cook

02:47.543 --> 02:52.296
in their sleep--
a perfect steak dinner.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.380
Ooh.

02:53.424 --> 02:55.465
Cooking the perfect steak
is an art.

02:55.509 --> 02:59.636
Every single decision you make
can have huge consequences

02:59.680 --> 03:01.221
or huge rewards.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.806
I know how to cook steak.

03:02.808 --> 03:06.393
<i>In the first cooking challenge,</i>
<i> being picked last,</i>

03:06.437 --> 03:09.479
it just screws with you.
It is definitely redemption day.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.024
There's lots of different
cuts of beef,

03:12.026 --> 03:14.318
and the platform's gonna
be packed with all of them.

03:14.361 --> 03:18.197
From the most expensive cut
down to the cheapest
pieces of meat,

03:18.240 --> 03:21.992
a great chef can make something
special out of any of them

03:22.036 --> 03:23.160
if you know
what to do with it.

03:23.204 --> 03:26.121
So prove to us you're
a next-level chef

03:26.165 --> 03:28.207
by knowing how to cook
whatever steak you end up with.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.042
I'm thinking it's very doable.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.753
We have two girls from texas.
I'm from the midwest.

03:32.796 --> 03:36.298
Like, I'm planning
to save our entire team
with a winning dish.

03:36.342 --> 03:38.300
I could literally
cook a steak with my eyes closed

03:38.344 --> 03:40.219
and just know exactly
when to turn it.

03:40.262 --> 03:43.096
When your time begins,
you'll grab one cut of beef

03:43.140 --> 03:45.340
and whatever
other ingredients you need

03:45.351 --> 03:49.019
to turn that into a next-level
steak dinner.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.646
All: Yes, chef.

03:50.648 --> 03:53.106
Nyesha:
<i> We're all looking</i>
<i> for the best steak dish</i>

03:53.150 --> 03:55.192
<i> from each one of these</i>
<i> individuals,</i>

03:55.236 --> 03:58.237
<i> but at the end of the day,</i>
<i> I want to see my team win.</i>

03:58.280 --> 03:59.696
This is my competition
to fight for.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.324
I expect all of you honestly

04:02.368 --> 04:05.160
to level-up your dishes
from here on out.

04:05.204 --> 04:08.288
And be prepared
for some surprises.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.291
- Oh, no
- ae:<i> Let's go!</i>

04:11.335 --> 04:13.502
There's gonna be a surprise
and it's not gonna be so fun.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.296
But maybe it is.
You never know what
you're gonna get.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.590
- Team blais.
- Yes, sir. Let's go!

04:18.634 --> 04:20.676
It's time to find out what level
you're gonna be cooking on.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.302
First, go grab a key card

04:22.304 --> 04:24.221
and head on over
to the elevator.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.432
I'm not grabbing it this time.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.059
All right.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.603
- ( beeps )
- let's go, guys!

04:31.647 --> 04:34.273
- Bye!
- Bye!

04:36.026 --> 04:37.526
I don't want the basement.

04:39.405 --> 04:42.489
- Go back up, go back up.
- ( squeals )

04:42.533 --> 04:47.202
- it's the basement, guys.
- Welcome to the dungeon.

04:47.246 --> 04:50.580
- Dun-dun-dun.
- This is...

04:52.293 --> 04:55.502
The bottom level is torture.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.838
Come on, we got this.
We got this.

04:57.881 --> 05:01.258
- Don't do it to me.
- No, it's a trick.
It's a trick.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.719
They're going to
bring us back down.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.763
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

05:06.765 --> 05:08.682
- Top kitchen again!
- ( cheering )

05:08.726 --> 05:11.560
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

05:11.603 --> 05:13.353
This is my old station.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.272
I'm back!

05:15.316 --> 05:19.109
- Y'all had six burners?
-<i> Basement was one thing.</i>

05:19.153 --> 05:23.113
If you give me the tools
for success, it's game on.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.406
( muttering )

05:24.450 --> 05:25.991
I'm not scared
of the basement.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.286
I cooked that whole entire first
meal with a knife and a tong.

05:29.330 --> 05:33.123
- Middle kitchen.
- Yes.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.751
Yes, baby. I love it.

05:35.753 --> 05:37.252
- We got it.
- We got this, girl.

05:37.296 --> 05:40.213
Perfect.
I've seen a kitchen like this.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.257
<i> It's way better</i>
<i> than my home kitchen.</i>

05:42.301 --> 05:45.135
But I don't feel like
a stranger in a strange land.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.970
If this is middle,
what does top look like?

05:47.014 --> 05:49.473
- Insane.
- I'm so ready right now.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.185
When the food gets down here,

05:53.228 --> 05:54.311
you're gonna have
next to nothing.

05:54.355 --> 05:58.231
I am pissed
that I am down here again.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.150
I'm just gonna fly my dog
and my wife out here.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.610
We're just gonna live
in the basement.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.987
These burners have two speeds,

06:04.031 --> 06:06.156
and it's zero
and ( bleep ) inferno.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.616
I'm so mad
I'm here right now.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.955
- All right, team blais.
Let's go.
- Aw, yeah!

06:13.999 --> 06:16.416
I'm a home cook
from a town of 3,400.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.877
And I really love getting
outside opinions,

06:18.921 --> 06:22.005
especially from somebody so
experienced as richard blais.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.716
I'm your mentor.
I want five people to be
the next level chef.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.218
And we're chefs,
we're competitive.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.303
We're competing
against each other as well.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.805
- We got it.
- Gordon: Good luck, girl.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.181
Thank you, chef. You, too.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.016
- I'm gonna kick your ass.
- ( laughs )

06:33.018 --> 06:36.103
what's up, team?
Let's go. Yes!

06:36.146 --> 06:38.438
Yes! Yes! Yes.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.191
I'm so excited
to be on chef nyesha's team.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.318
<i> She carries a lot</i>
<i> of confidence with her,</i>

06:43.362 --> 06:46.071
and so I'm hoping
to really learn a lot
from her in that sense.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.031
- One, two, three!
- All: Winners!

06:48.033 --> 06:50.700
Hi, chef!

06:50.744 --> 06:53.161
- Let's go, come on!
- Yes!

06:53.205 --> 06:57.207
- Man! We good?
Let's go. Right.
- Yes!

06:57.251 --> 07:00.210
- This is time to shine.
State of the art kitchen.
- Yes.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.379
- Hundred percent.
- We have to win this.

07:02.381 --> 07:05.841
I do not want to lose against
nyesha and richard blais.

07:05.884 --> 07:09.052
I want those judges downstairs
to be blown away by you five.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.554
- Is that clear?
- Heard, chef!

07:10.597 --> 07:14.349
Line up at the back.
The platform is on its way.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.143
- We got this, y'all.
We got this.
- 30 seconds.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.936
It's gonna go quick, okay?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.938
Make sure you grab
all the ingredients you need

07:19.982 --> 07:21.523
to make your stunning dish.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.316
- Gordon: It's moving.
- It's moving.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.485
When that turns green,
we're going.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.446
Here we go. Let's go!

07:27.448 --> 07:31.491
One perfect steak dinner.
Let's go.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.201
Cream of the crop.

07:33.245 --> 07:35.245
Only two--
only three potatoes.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.204
Here's shallots?
Anyone need shallots?

07:36.248 --> 07:38.123
- Rosemary!
- Lime!

07:38.167 --> 07:40.000
Am I about to have
a heart attack?

07:40.043 --> 07:42.169
I don't think I can feel
my nose. Is this a stroke?

07:42.212 --> 07:44.045
-<i> It's horrible. </i>
- Oh, my god.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.506
- Gordon: Go, go, go, go!
- We have curry!
We have mushrooms!

07:46.550 --> 07:48.258
Woman: Does anyone see
a new york strip?

07:48.302 --> 07:50.760
- New york strips right here.
- Thank you.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.387
- Garlic?
- Rosemary.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.389
- Do we need onions?
- Gordon: Five, four...

07:54.433 --> 07:57.517
- Any garlic? Oh.
- Three, two...

07:57.561 --> 08:00.312
- Does anyone see thyme?
- ...One, let go!

08:00.355 --> 08:04.649
- Let go!
- I dropped a tomato.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.613
Nyesha:
It's coming, guys. Go!

08:12.451 --> 08:15.368
Pyet:
<i> My eyes and my mind</i>
<i> cannot focus.</i>

08:15.412 --> 08:18.038
You kinda just start, like,
becoming panicked and frantic.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.624
What are we getting?
Do we have starches?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.501
- Ooh.
- Okay.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.252
Last time, my steak
was cooked horribly.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.004
<i> So this is my chance</i>
<i> right here</i>

08:26.006 --> 08:29.090
to prove that the texan
can do beef.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.177
Whoo! Damn it.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.763
- Oh!
- Was that a steak?

08:34.765 --> 08:36.431
A gift from the heavens!

08:36.475 --> 08:37.849
( groans )

08:37.976 --> 08:41.353
<i> I have this beautiful</i>
<i> flat iron steak and I drop it.</i>

08:41.396 --> 08:43.980
- Steak down, steak down.
- And it goes straight down.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.690
Okay, steak down,
steak down.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.025
Nyesha:
<i> Come on, amber.</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:49.236
<i> The platform grab</i>
<i> is everything.</i>

08:49.279 --> 08:51.321
<i> We can't just be throwing</i>
<i> products everywhere.</i>

08:51.365 --> 08:53.365
I'm looking
for the next level chef.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.117
Three! Come on, guys!
We got it.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.245
Time's up!
Grab your ingredients.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.665
Only what you need.
Grab your ingredients.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.252
Blais: Go! Go!

09:06.296 --> 09:09.381
- Think clearly.
- ( muted chatter )

09:09.424 --> 09:11.466
- ( bleep )
- the only thing that's
left is beef liver.

09:11.510 --> 09:14.511
<i> I don't even know</i>
<i> what to do with it.</i>

09:14.555 --> 09:17.847
Oh, that's right.
And I look underneath
and grab that steak.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.182
Blais:
Whatever you can grab.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.017
You only got a couple
seconds left, team blais.

09:21.019 --> 09:24.020
Grab your last things.
You can grab it until goes.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.398
Grab it until it goes.
There we go! There we go!

09:26.400 --> 09:29.401
- Oh! Whoo!
- All right, team blais.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.653
What happened up there
with that steak?

09:31.697 --> 09:33.029
Thanks for the flat iron!

09:33.031 --> 09:35.991
Meat gods,
I'd like to thank you.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.285
I probably should
buy a lottery ticket.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.453
Nyesha:
45 minute starts now.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.164
Make sure that steak
is shining.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.001
I cannot believe I did that.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.752
That was a beautiful
piece of meat.

09:47.796 --> 09:51.089
I'm horrified.
Like, girl, you're not
doing this again.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.757
You are not screwing up
a steak challenge.

09:52.801 --> 09:58.054
- Starting strong,
starting strong.
- Let's do it.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.181
Let's show the rest
of these teams how it's done.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.017
Come on, guys.
We got this. Let's go.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.060
Let's do this, team ramsay!

10:04.104 --> 10:07.188
- We wanna win, come on.
- Make sure you're breathing.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.565
- I didn't grab any veg.
- What's wrong?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.234
I didn't grab any veg.
I mean, I got my parsnip,
but I wanted--

10:11.278 --> 10:12.944
- is that it?
- I know I could do better,

10:12.988 --> 10:15.155
and I'm just not showing
how I'm talented.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.489
I got here for a reason,

10:16.533 --> 10:18.566
and I feel like
I'm disappointing myself.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.160
I'm not doing
the best that I can,

10:20.203 --> 10:22.203
so I'm frustrated
a little at myself.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.497
I can do so much better.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.741
<i> I really need</i>
<i> to show chef ramsay</i>

10:26.752 --> 10:28.084
<i> that I'm a solid draft pick.</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:29.586
<i> You didn't go wrong.</i>

10:33.592 --> 10:34.591
What's wrong?

10:34.635 --> 10:35.508
I'm not doing
the best that I can,

10:35.761 --> 10:37.719
so I'm frustrated
a little at myself.

10:37.763 --> 10:38.970
I'm here to help you.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.472
We gotta get rid
of those nerves.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.223
- I got to get rid of them.
- Okay?

10:42.267 --> 10:45.101
I'm in my head,
and I need to go back
to my hands and my heart

10:45.145 --> 10:46.519
<i> and cook like I love cooking.</i>

10:46.563 --> 10:48.429
I need to figure it out
because I want to be here.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.273
I want to be
the next level chef.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.524
I don't have a lot of
ingredients,

10:51.568 --> 10:53.026
but if my dad
had these ingredients,

10:53.070 --> 10:54.277
he'd make a feast for everyone.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.029
I want to kind of
tap in to my jamaican roots.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.531
I'm doing a very light rub
on the wagyu.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.993
- Head up, let's go.
- I'm doing this for
my little island.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.995
Gordon:
Top floor kitchen today
for team ramsay,

11:04.039 --> 11:05.955
and they've all got
an amazing cut of beef.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.499
Fingers crossed
we'll get that dish today,

11:07.542 --> 11:10.293
and that'll keep us
safe from elimination.

11:11.797 --> 11:14.047
Nyesha:
How are we getting flavor
into those short ribs?

11:14.049 --> 11:15.006
Number one, you gotta
cook a steak right.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.008
That is gonna be
the last thing that happens

11:17.094 --> 11:17.967
because it's gonna
be so quick.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.387
- Being from texas?
- I mean, that hurt.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.138
They're not gonna
let you back.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.224
No, it really did.
It genuinely hurt.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.436
I am amber from austin, texas,
and I am a home cook.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.314
<i> I am a quintessential</i>
<i> texas girl in many ways.</i>

11:31.358 --> 11:34.609
I am frequently an issue.
Hi, babies.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.027
<i> My favorite thing to do</i>

11:36.029 --> 11:38.321
<i> is cook for my friends</i>
<i> and family.</i>

11:38.365 --> 11:39.739
I'll be honest,
when I serve a dish,

11:39.783 --> 11:41.408
I'm always going for sex sounds.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.828
<i> That's my sort of litmus test</i>
<i> for how good the food is.</i>

11:44.830 --> 11:47.455
Their whole body slumps
and their head goes back
and they're just like--

11:47.499 --> 11:50.458
they do that,
I'm like, "oh, yeah."

11:50.502 --> 11:54.003
<i> a year-long mentorship</i>
<i> with these chefs?</i>

11:54.047 --> 11:55.171
<i> It would be life-changing.</i>

11:55.465 --> 11:57.549
<i> I would be able to really cook</i>
<i> on a larger scale,</i>

11:57.551 --> 12:00.009
<i> to start doing</i>
<i> some private cheffing</i>

12:00.053 --> 12:02.470
and touch more
hearts and tummies.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.806
I still have time
to save myself.

12:04.850 --> 12:05.849
Nyesha:
<i> Amber needs to step up.</i>

12:06.226 --> 12:09.394
<i> Last challenge,</i>
<i> amber's steak was overcooked,</i>

12:09.438 --> 12:12.063
but I think that
she has the potential

12:12.107 --> 12:14.816
to go very far
in this competition.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.026
The time is "cook faster."

12:17.028 --> 12:18.528
cook with intention.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.030
Richard: All right,
you're around 30 minutes,

12:21.241 --> 12:23.199
a little less than,
okay, team?

12:23.201 --> 12:24.367
Whoo! All right! Yeah!

12:24.411 --> 12:27.245
My reputation
is on the line as well.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.998
I do not want to lose, okay?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.374
Oh, I got a plan.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.001
Lord only knows
if it's gonna work.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.544
Uh, you are a minimalist.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.296
Last time, you only had
a couple of ingredients.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.089
This time you have
maybe even less.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.507
I have a flat iron.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.009
Are you gonna wash it off
or something like that?

12:41.011 --> 12:42.051
- I don't know.
- Yeah, I could wash it off.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.095
Rosemary, ketchup,
and a shallot.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.472
You chose these things.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.348
Yeah, I'm gonna do
a barbeque sauce,

12:47.392 --> 12:48.308
and I'm gonna
pickle this shallot.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.310
I mean, you might as well
just pop open

12:50.353 --> 12:52.604
- a can of beer down here.
- God, yeah.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.522
- Okay, gary,
are you feeling it, gary?
- Oh, yeah!

12:54.566 --> 12:58.318
Gary:<i> Chef blais I've seen</i>
<i> on a million different shows.</i>

12:58.361 --> 13:00.945
I'm so excited
to work with him.

13:00.989 --> 13:04.157
As a kid, I was always
attracted to fire.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.618
- I loved fire.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:08.163 --> 13:09.871
And I'm very loud
as a person.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.289
"normal people scare me!"

13:11.666 --> 13:14.542
and it's just funny,
'cause my mother would
always yell at me to,

13:14.544 --> 13:16.419
<i> "shut up!</i>
<i> You're being too loud."</i>

13:16.463 --> 13:20.590
now here I am, the loudest
( bleep ) on tiktok.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.258
Wagyu brisket!

13:22.260 --> 13:23.551
( bleep ) it up
with the rub!

13:23.595 --> 13:25.929
Wrap it in some paper
and let it ride!

13:25.972 --> 13:27.222
And I'm making money doing it.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.516
I ( bleep ) love barbecue!

13:29.559 --> 13:32.602
- Gary is feeling it
all of a sudden.
- All right, okay.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.020
- All right, ae.
- Whoo!

13:34.064 --> 13:35.188
All right,
we're back at it, right?

13:35.232 --> 13:37.065
Okay, I got
some thin-sliced steak.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.983
- By choice?
- No!

13:39.027 --> 13:41.361
- Okay, all right. Right.
This is what was left.
- Bottom of the barrel.

13:41.404 --> 13:45.240
- I'm going to finesse
a bulgogi beef situation.
- Okay.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.117
Thin-sliced steak.
Buddha, help me.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.953
That's what this is about.
We're in the basement.

13:49.955 --> 13:54.040
- We're making it happen.
- Oh, my god, I'm stressed.

13:54.042 --> 13:58.378
All my friends upstairs
I know got bold, delicious,
vibrant cuts of meat.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.380
I'm feeling petty,
I'm feeling sad.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.006
But I'm like,
"you know what?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.258
This is not gonna break me.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.094
<i> I'm gonna maximize.</i>
<i> Whatever I gotta do."</i>

14:06.137 --> 14:07.929
- how is everyone feeling?
- Great, chef.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.139
- Doing great, chef.
- You planning on plating
on time today, sergio?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.724
- Oh, yeah.
I'll be ready for you.
- Yeah, you are. Let's go.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.143
My man's awake today.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.021
- How much time is left.
- Thyme is right here.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.441
- No, time left in the game.
- Oh.

14:20.485 --> 14:24.404
Nyesha:
<i> I want my team to win</i>
<i> because I believe I chose</i>

14:24.447 --> 14:26.614
<i> the right chefs</i>
<i> to bring it home.</i>

14:26.616 --> 14:28.533
And I want to nurture them
and see them grow

14:28.535 --> 14:31.411
because that's the investment
I have in them.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.663
<i> And of course I want to beat</i>
<i> richard and gordon.</i>

14:36.376 --> 14:38.418
Let's be honest,
we got five of the best cuts.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.253
Ooh, there we go.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.422
This is it, guys.
We wanna win. Come on.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.091
- Kenny, talk to me.
- I'm gonna go with a filet.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.676
The rolls-royce.
What are you doing
with the eggs?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.177
- Gnocchi. Yeah.
- A gnocchi?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.721
A gnocchi's gonna be
a nightmare to get done.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.180
Get that in early.
Let's go.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.558
- Yes?
- Done deal.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.772
Richard: Courtney,
this is redemption day.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.024
Have you cooked
with a hanger steak before?

15:01.026 --> 15:02.275
I've never cooked with
a hanger steak before.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.944
The hanger steak's
a really special cut
of meat, actually.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.989
There's only one per cow.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.033
<i> Ooh, I got a good cut of meat.</i>

15:10.076 --> 15:12.493
Somebody up above
didn't realize what this was

15:12.537 --> 15:15.997
and I'm thankful that it made
its way to the basement.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.373
<i> I mean, the stakes are high,</i>

15:17.417 --> 15:19.292
and I want to do
my absolute best.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.253
Because if I can save
the four other people around me,

15:22.297 --> 15:23.463
I'm happy to do that.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.424
Ooh. Why did I do that?
Nobody knows.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.343
All right, mariah,
you're the first-round
draft pick.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.137
- No pressure, no pressure.
- Oh, thanks, yeah.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.263
I'm thinking
about doing a play, like,

15:32.557 --> 15:34.974
instead of chicken and waffles,
cube steak and waffles.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.268
- Cube steak,
that could be tricky.
- Yeah.

15:37.312 --> 15:41.356
- Go with your instincts.
- Okay, will do, chef.
Thank you.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.567
Come on. Top flight kitchen,
top flight dishes, yes?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.486
- All: Yes, chef!
- All right, look at me,
all of you.

15:46.529 --> 15:51.157
I told you there's a surprise.
What goes well with a steak?

15:51.201 --> 15:53.368
Steaks need heat.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.703
Nyesha:
We warned you about surprises.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.288
- Let's go, let's go.
- Okay.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.790
Oh, my god,
what is happening?

15:58.833 --> 16:01.084
Why is that thing--
why is that thing coming down?

16:01.127 --> 16:02.418
Richard:
Listen, you didn't think
we'd have just one

16:02.462 --> 16:05.630
- platform drop, did you?
- Oh, no!

16:05.674 --> 16:07.048
The platform is dropping.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.550
You know what steak needs?
Steak needs some heat.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.762
- It needs some spice.
-<i> What in the hell is going on?</i>

16:12.764 --> 16:15.014
Like, we already
picked our item.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.225
<i> This is serious.</i>
<i> The fun has stopped.</i>

16:17.268 --> 16:20.395
- Why? Why?
- Oh, my gosh.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.231
What's happening right now?
What is happening?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.945
I told you there's a surprise.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.738
What goes well with a steak?

16:30.782 --> 16:33.449
- Chilis.
- Steaks need heat.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.494
My team, we are strong.
We're super strong.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.288
<i> And I'm gonna test these chefs</i>
<i> in every way possible,</i>

16:39.332 --> 16:43.626
<i> to really find out</i>
<i> who is that next level chef.</i>

16:44.629 --> 16:46.587
Each of you grab a chili

16:46.631 --> 16:50.425
and infuse it across your dish.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.552
You've gotta use it!
Let's go!

16:52.595 --> 16:54.345
Ten seconds!

16:54.389 --> 16:55.888
Devonnie:<i> Basically, I think</i>
<i> it's a gift from the gods</i>

16:55.932 --> 16:57.306
because I know
what to do with this!

16:57.600 --> 17:00.351
- Devonnie: Yes!
-<i> We use a lot of pepper</i>
<i> in jamaican cuisine,</i>

17:00.395 --> 17:03.021
<i> so I decide to grab</i>
<i> the habanero pepper.</i>

17:03.023 --> 17:04.230
Gordon:
Five, four...

17:04.232 --> 17:05.231
I'm gonna pickle these,

17:05.483 --> 17:07.942
add a nice little element
to my dish. Good.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.277
Gordon:
...One, and go!

17:09.320 --> 17:12.030
Well done! Chilis!
We need the heat.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.948
Nyesha:
Let's get some chilis.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.324
On the platform.
Go get your chilis.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.410
- Okay. All right.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.246
A next level chef
knows how to adapt.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.206
Anything can happen,
and it's happening.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.585
<i> So I grab what I think</i>
<i> are sichuan peppers.</i>

17:26.671 --> 17:28.588
<i> They're diablo peppers,</i>

17:28.631 --> 17:30.131
which I've never used.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.550
Steak needs some heat,
it needs some spice.

17:32.552 --> 17:36.971
You have to grab a chili pepper.
You have to use it in your dish.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.223
You can grab
as many as you want.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.600
<i> Huge curve ball. Ugh!</i>

17:40.643 --> 17:42.185
I already got this dish going.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.353
- Ah!
- Oh! Oh!

17:44.397 --> 17:47.231
- This isn't good.
- I thought it was
gonna be steak.

17:47.275 --> 17:50.526
- ( laughing )
- but it wasn't.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.279
- Aw, man, we're crushing it.
- Roice, tell me what you got.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.822
So I got a tomahawk rib-eye.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.200
- Man, how happy
are you right now?
- Pretty happy.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.868
Did not grab
a starch in time,

17:58.912 --> 17:59.952
so I'm gonna
create my own starch.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.788
I'm gonna create a thyme
and brown butter cracker.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.207
Smart.
I love the idea, roice,
of the biscuit, yeah?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.208
- Thank you, chef.
- Love it.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.959
<i> I knew I forgot a starch.</i>

18:07.003 --> 18:08.419
<i> But I can make</i>
<i> a brown butter cracker,</i>

18:08.463 --> 18:10.088
and I know
they're gonna die for that.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.173
All the juices on that plate
are gonna get soaked

18:12.217 --> 18:13.132
right up by that cracker.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.383
What's it feel like
to have the rib cap

18:14.427 --> 18:16.260
on the back of that
processed beef?

18:16.304 --> 18:18.346
- Better than
potted meat, right?
- I'll say.

18:18.389 --> 18:21.933
I'm gonna do a jerk rib cap
and an asparagus puree.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.310
Dude, those hands are shaking.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.520
What do you expect?
You're in front of me.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.814
Closest I've been to you
is youtube, so...

18:27.816 --> 18:30.441
You do not look like
a guy that shakes.
Come on, man!

18:30.485 --> 18:32.151
Nothing to be
nervous about, reuel.

18:32.195 --> 18:34.153
Gordon:
20 minutes to go.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.147
Remember, two of you will be
cooking off in an elimination,

18:36.157 --> 18:38.366
and I don't want it
to be anyone from my team.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.827
We need to beat those
two kitchens downstairs, yes?

18:40.870 --> 18:42.036
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef!

18:42.080 --> 18:44.205
Come on. Let's go.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.373
Nyesha:
Ten minutes, guys.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.083
Cook with your gut.
Cook with intention.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.085
We got flambé.
Okay, chef zachary.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.920
Watch them eyebrows.
Let it-- just let it be.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.047
- I only have
half eyebrows anyway.
- Just let it burn off.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.007
Working like
lightning speed, girl.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.552
We trying to make moves
happen over here.

18:57.595 --> 19:00.888
Pyet:<i> I am making</i>
<i> a pan-seared tri-tip steak</i>

19:00.932 --> 19:03.558
<i> with ginger glaze, carrots,</i>
<i> and sautéed bok choy.</i>

19:03.601 --> 19:06.185
I'm cleaning my bok choy now,
trimming it,

19:06.229 --> 19:08.521
letting it kinda air dry.
I'm gonna sauté it at the end.

19:08.565 --> 19:11.315
- Nyesha: Where are you from?
- I'm from kansas city,
but I live in la now.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.234
- Oh, so you're familiar
with tri-tip.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.235
I mean, I don't
cook it very often,

19:14.529 --> 19:15.111
but I think I know what
I'm gonna do with this.

19:15.572 --> 19:19.115
- Okay, good.
-<i> My name is pyet.</i>

19:19.159 --> 19:20.241
<i> I'm from kansas city.</i>

19:20.285 --> 19:21.325
I'm a social media chef

19:21.369 --> 19:24.203
and I am native american.

19:24.247 --> 19:27.957
I grew up on a reservation
most of my childhood.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.501
<i> I moved to los angeles</i>
<i> to follow my dreams</i>

19:30.545 --> 19:32.420
<i> of being a big-time chef</i>

19:32.422 --> 19:34.630
and wasn't making
a lot of money.

19:34.674 --> 19:38.134
I couldn't even pay rent,
so I was living out of my car.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.554
<i> I was at my lowest low</i>
<i> trying to figure out</i>
<i> why I'm doing this.</i>

19:41.556 --> 19:45.516
<i> It all was circling around</i>
<i> bringing pride to my people,</i>

19:45.560 --> 19:48.019
<i> and, like, how can</i>
<i> I do that through food?</i>

19:48.062 --> 19:49.562
And I started focusing on that.

19:49.564 --> 19:53.024
That's when things
really started to turn
around for me.

19:53.067 --> 19:57.153
<i> When I win</i>
<i> the next level chef</i>
<i> competition,</i>

19:57.197 --> 19:59.197
I plan on using the money

19:59.240 --> 20:01.741
to open up a few pop-up
restaurants

20:01.743 --> 20:04.744
where I'm able to cook
and showcase

20:04.746 --> 20:06.412
native american food
to the public.

20:06.456 --> 20:10.666
<i> I also want to buy a new car.</i>

20:10.710 --> 20:12.001
<i> ( laughs )</i>

20:12.003 --> 20:13.002
<i> in case I have</i>
<i> to live in it again.</i>

20:13.046 --> 20:15.213
It'll be nice and big.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.301
Oh, yeah.
That's that sear I want.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.512
Oh, I love that sizzle! Whoo!

20:23.556 --> 20:25.306
- Is that a roux?
- It is a roux.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.099
Gonna make a little béchamel.

20:27.143 --> 20:30.102
I'm going to do
a seared top round

20:30.146 --> 20:31.729
with a swiss chard gratin.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.730
A top round's probably
a little tough.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.190
Yeah, I'm worried
about the top round myself.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.399
The thing you have to be
careful about

20:35.443 --> 20:37.193
is that it can be tough, right?

20:37.237 --> 20:40.321
The other teams are up there
cooking with wagyu beef,

20:40.365 --> 20:44.158
so you have to take this
top round to the next level.

20:44.202 --> 20:45.368
I'm incredibly nervous
about this cut of meat.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.913
I've cooked it before.
It was not great.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.282
<i> With this competition,</i>
<i> there comes a lot</i>
<i> of self-doubt.</i>

20:51.284 --> 20:52.166
You know,
"do I belong here?"

20:52.418 --> 20:55.002
<i> I'm a home cook</i>
<i> from a town of 3,400.</i>

20:55.046 --> 20:57.964
It is a heavy weight
to prove myself.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.424
Remember, we're the first
floor that plates.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.176
Nyesha:
Make sure there's balance
between the protein

21:02.220 --> 21:04.136
and the starch.
Make sure there's balance.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.429
Produce a little more.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.640
- Two minutes, guys.
Start plating.
- Heard.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.308
Woman: Heard, chef.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.760
Amber, put your plate down
so you can plate on it.

21:11.762 --> 21:13.020
Bring the food--
it's not funny.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.273
No, I'm sorry, you're right.
Yes, chef.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.192
Last two minutes.
Here we go.

21:18.236 --> 21:21.028
Oh, my god.
My hands are shaking so bad.

21:21.030 --> 21:26.033
Let's go, team blais.
Your platform is here
and you've got 15 seconds.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.493
You have 15 seconds!

21:31.165 --> 21:34.166
- Eight, seven, six, five.
- Oh, that looks good.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.710
Did you get everything on there?

21:35.753 --> 21:38.087
- Yes.
- Three, two, one.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.673
- Good job, everybody.
- ( cheering )

21:40.675 --> 21:43.342
- yeah!
- Yes! Whoo!

21:43.386 --> 21:46.345
Platform's coming.
Let's go, let's go!

21:47.432 --> 21:50.224
Look at that valet service.
Valet!

21:50.268 --> 21:52.184
You know how good it feels
to not have to jump this time?

21:52.228 --> 21:54.270
- Let's go! Exactly, let's go!
- That's right, baby.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.314
- Let's go, let's go.
- Whoo!

21:56.357 --> 21:58.149
Gordon: Come on.
Come on, come on.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.984
We have got to plate, guys.

22:00.028 --> 22:03.195
- Five, four, three...
- There we go.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.155
...Two, one, and go.

22:04.449 --> 22:07.033
- And, yo, we're done!
- Well done! Well done.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.036
- Good work.
- Oh, ( bleep ). Biscuits.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.997
Oh, no. My four biscuits
are still there.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.249
<i> I forgot to plate them.</i>
<i> I'm gutted.</i>

22:15.293 --> 22:17.326
<i> I have the absolute best</i>
<i> kitchen to cook in,</i>

22:17.337 --> 22:18.419
and I made another mistake.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.296
I forgot another thing
for my dish.

22:20.340 --> 22:23.424
Roice, don't do this to me.
What's wrong with you?

22:23.468 --> 22:25.301
I didn't choose you for that.
Smarten up.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.345
I'm looking
for the next level chef.

22:31.934 --> 22:35.728
Now, each of us
have no idea who cooked what
on the other kitchens.

22:35.730 --> 22:38.397
Yes, we each want
our team to win,

22:38.441 --> 22:41.350
but the integrity of the dishes
are always the first priority.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.320
We'll be basing all our
decisions purely on taste,

22:44.364 --> 22:48.324
presentation,
and how you conceptualized
that next-level steak.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.242
Richard:
The top dish of the day

22:50.286 --> 22:52.536
will get safety
for their entire team.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.289
The two losing teams
will then have to send someone

22:55.333 --> 22:56.582
into the elimination cook-off.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.250
Each one of us mentors

22:58.252 --> 22:59.877
wants to have the best dish,

22:59.879 --> 23:02.880
<i> or else we're gonna have to</i>
<i>put someone in the elimination.</i>

23:02.882 --> 23:03.881
Right, shall we start?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.424
- Nyesha, with the top level?
- Yes, chef.

23:05.468 --> 23:10.179
- Okay.
- This is the rib cap.

23:10.181 --> 23:12.098
Is that a chive bundle
around that asparagus?

23:12.141 --> 23:14.141
- Yeah. Yeah.
- The asparagus is peeled?

23:15.770 --> 23:17.269
That rib cap
is cooked beautifully.

23:17.313 --> 23:21.148
Potatoes, asparagus--
it's a very cohesive dish.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.651
There's an elegant chili
on my palate.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.112
Second dish.
New york strip.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.823
As always, the essence,
in my mind, is the cook.

23:28.866 --> 23:29.615
- Absolutely.
- How did that go?

23:29.867 --> 23:32.618
- Steak challenge.
- Oh, no, no.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.702
- Look at that.
- Stunning.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.080
To me, this
is perfectly cooked.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.415
Stop doubting yourself.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.418
So, this is a filet mignon,
the rolls-royce cut.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.670
- Homemade gnocchi.
- You made gnocchi?

23:42.755 --> 23:45.339
Slightly under.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.427
- Gnocchi's beautiful.
- Soft, pillowy.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.262
Nice riff on steak
and potatoes.

23:51.305 --> 23:54.348
- A rib-eye.
- Artfully plated.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.311
The onion really
wakes this dish up.

23:59.313 --> 24:02.398
- It's sweet, it's spicy.
- That's good.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.609
And then, finally, tomahawk.

24:07.613 --> 24:11.157
So, this individual decided to
make the most amazing cracker

24:11.200 --> 24:15.286
- but forgot to put them on.
- Bummer.

24:15.288 --> 24:18.664
This would have been
a huge selling point
in our choice.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.583
Oh, no.
I don't want to go home.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.751
<i> Hopefully that tomahawk</i>
<i> was good enough.</i>

24:22.795 --> 24:26.422
- I'm just super stressed.
- Next up, mid floor.

24:26.466 --> 24:29.049
Tri-tip.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.177
- That cook.
- Whoo.

24:34.307 --> 24:37.475
The actual cook
is absolutely perfect,

24:37.518 --> 24:40.186
and a tough protein
to get right.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.520
You have nice crust on this.
It's rested.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.397
Gordon: But the bok choy
doesn't make sense.

24:43.441 --> 24:44.440
You can't put that on raw.

24:44.775 --> 24:47.067
Whoever cooked this,
this stuff is horrible raw.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.653
Pyet:<i> Dagger in the stomach.</i>

24:49.655 --> 24:51.947
I walked into this challenge
feeling extremely confident.

24:51.949 --> 24:55.201
And, like, what was I thinking
when I grabbed that bok choy?

24:55.244 --> 24:58.120
- Next one?
- This is the flank steak.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.538
- It's cooked beautifully.
- It's gorgeous.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.624
Yeah, it's got this
rustic charm, this dish.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.545
- This is someone who cooked
a lot of red meat before.
- Flavor.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.297
- The seasoning's on point.
- Absolutely.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.007
The one thing it needs for me
is the heat.

25:10.051 --> 25:13.427
- I can't taste the chili.
- Next one, skirt steak.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.640
Unfortunately, inside
it's actually raw

25:17.683 --> 25:19.558
because it's a solid mass.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.186
Very hard to swallow.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.563
- Next one?
- This is a top round, yes.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.316
- Plating looks
a little bit dated.
- Yes, very dated.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.110
Clearly the elevator
also stops in 1984.

25:34.992 --> 25:38.410
So, whoever cooked this,
I don't know if you're
a social media star,

25:38.454 --> 25:40.538
a home cook,
or a restaurant chef,

25:40.540 --> 25:41.572
I don't give a ( bleep )

25:41.791 --> 25:44.208
because that right there
is cooked beautifully.

25:44.252 --> 25:47.294
There's love on that plate.

25:47.338 --> 25:50.631
- The final dish?
- Final dish,
we have a short rib.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.341
This person grabbed
three ingredients--

25:52.385 --> 25:55.094
petit onion, sweet potato,
and short rib,

25:55.137 --> 25:57.513
and sesame seeds as a garnish.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.515
And those sesame seeds,
they look like birdseed

25:59.559 --> 26:02.184
at the bottom
of my granddad's cage
for his parrot.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.395
- Wow.
- My grandmother,
as a korean immigrant,

26:04.397 --> 26:07.523
would be ashamed to see
any sort of sesame not toasted.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.275
They just seem
like an afterthought.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.694
- There's no seasoning
on there whatsoever.
- Zero.

26:11.737 --> 26:16.323
I'd love to taste a little bit
of more chili throughout this.

26:16.367 --> 26:19.660
To cook a bad steak twice?
It brings shame on me.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.495
I know that my friends and
family love me no matter what,

26:21.539 --> 26:25.165
but every other texan is gonna
be sending me hate mail.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.292
- Shall we?
Basement, richard, please?
- Yep.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.961
Richard:<i> I'm excited</i>
<i> for gordon and nyesha</i>

26:29.005 --> 26:31.422
<i> to taste my team's food.</i>

26:31.465 --> 26:33.507
They may not have had the best
ingredients or equipment,

26:33.551 --> 26:36.135
but I think their tastes
are gonna shine through.

26:36.178 --> 26:40.014
This is a flat iron steak
that fell from the sky
into this kitchen.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.266
- What? What?
- Yes.

26:42.310 --> 26:45.561
- You dropped it.
- Mm-hmm. Shh. Shh.

26:45.563 --> 26:47.313
Did any other vegetables
fall from the ceiling?

26:47.356 --> 26:50.190
No, but, thank goodness
that these hatch chilies

26:50.234 --> 26:53.110
did arrive
in the mid-round drop.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.279
- Shall we?
- Yes.

26:56.324 --> 26:58.115
There was no seasoning
on that meat.

26:58.159 --> 27:00.367
And the barbecue sauce
is a little too sweet.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.411
Brutal. Brutal.

27:02.455 --> 27:05.080
I'm really feeling
like I need a drink.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.709
All right, next up,
a korean barbecue inspired dish.

27:08.753 --> 27:13.255
- Bulgogi chopped beef.
- Is this chili meant to be
a garnish or eaten?

27:13.299 --> 27:15.132
That was hidden in there
purposefully undercover

27:15.176 --> 27:17.509
- for one of those--
- sabotage.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.220
Well, the actual beef
is delicious.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.097
I want to get that inside
a little lettuce cup

27:22.141 --> 27:23.682
- and do a wrap.
- So much flavor in there.

27:23.726 --> 27:26.018
It's good.
Is that a waffle?

27:26.020 --> 27:29.229
It's chicken-fried cube steak
and waffles.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.357
- Basement kitchen.
- Kudos, whoever done that.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.277
Um, and the steak,
to get one of the cheapest,

27:35.321 --> 27:37.446
the kind of cut that my mum
would serve us

27:37.490 --> 27:39.615
every Friday or Saturday night,
it takes me home.

27:39.617 --> 27:42.201
Very, very inventive.

27:42.244 --> 27:46.747
A hanger steak with
a carrot top chimichurri.

27:46.791 --> 27:49.500
So, steak is just
on the raw side.

27:49.543 --> 27:50.709
When you have that white fat,
that is so solid.

27:51.045 --> 27:54.004
- Never had a chance to render.
- That, unfortunately, is raw.

27:54.048 --> 27:54.713
What a shame.

27:54.757 --> 27:55.798
- Oh.
- ( bleep )

27:56.133 --> 27:57.091
- what a shame. It's just raw.
- It's undercooked.

27:57.718 --> 28:01.178
- What a shame.
- I'm extremely
disappointed in myself.

28:01.222 --> 28:03.055
<i> I know how to cook a steak.</i>

28:03.099 --> 28:04.973
"you screwed
this ( bleep ) up again."

28:05.017 --> 28:09.561
top round steak
with a swiss chard gratin.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.189
I can't believe
that this dish comes
from the basement.

28:12.233 --> 28:15.025
It's a piece of art.
The color on the panko
breadcrumbs.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.318
- Gorgeous.
- Is there anything more

28:16.362 --> 28:18.237
inviting than
buttery breadcrumbs?

28:18.280 --> 28:20.114
What?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.825
- Gratin are exceptional.
- Delicious.

28:22.827 --> 28:26.161
This is exactly what this
competition is here to prove--

28:26.163 --> 28:28.288
that an excellent chef
can make magic

28:28.332 --> 28:30.290
no matter what level
they're on.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.251
Nyesha:
Just a beautiful burst of chili.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.169
It is a pleasant sort of
burn there in the end.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.422
- What?
- Amazing.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.258
Jonathan:
<i> When there are titans</i>
<i> of industry trying your food</i>

28:39.301 --> 28:42.636
<i> telling you how well you did,</i>
<i> it's the ultimate validation.</i>

28:42.680 --> 28:44.513
And sometimes you feel-- whew.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.014
Sorry.

28:46.016 --> 28:47.015
I'm so proud of you.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.892
All of you,
please give us a moment.

28:48.936 --> 28:52.646
I'm just sweating.
I know I'm going to be
in the elimination challenge.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.097
This is tough.
Very tough.

28:54.108 --> 28:56.191
What a shame
with that tomahawk,

28:56.235 --> 28:58.360
by the way, those crackers.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.487
Top floor kitchen,
there's some beauties there.

29:00.531 --> 29:04.491
That rib cap.
I know he's on my team,
but that's beside the point.

29:04.535 --> 29:07.369
- That's the best dish today.
- Very impressed with that.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.289
The utilization of herbs,
it was very elegant.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.124
I mean, I think
the swiss chard gratin

29:12.168 --> 29:14.418
is one of my favorite things
of the whole day.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.378
The fact that it
was cooked in the basement?

29:16.422 --> 29:17.755
That looks like a top level--

29:17.757 --> 29:19.214
- yeah.
- Absolutely.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.174
- It tasted like a top level.
- Absolutely.

29:20.468 --> 29:22.384
For me, my top two,
definitely the rib cap

29:22.428 --> 29:25.012
- and definitely the gratin.
- Definitely rib cap.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.723
That's no question for me.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.309
Let's go.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.605
There is one dish
that we felt hit all
the right notes.

29:36.484 --> 29:39.318
Congratulations...

29:39.361 --> 29:40.152
Reuel.

29:40.196 --> 29:42.529
- Yeah.
- ( cheering )

29:45.284 --> 29:48.160
- love you.
- You saved my ass, man.

29:48.204 --> 29:49.828
So much confidence
in this dish.

29:49.830 --> 29:53.540
Reuel, this looks like it comes
from a top level restaurant.

29:53.542 --> 29:58.253
If I went to any michelin
restaurant and received this,
I would not be mad.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.464
I put my soul on that plate.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.466
<i> This is all validation</i>
<i> to this point.</i>

30:02.510 --> 30:06.178
I'm here to bring food
that slaps.

30:06.222 --> 30:08.388
Team ramsay,
you're safe from elimination.

30:08.432 --> 30:10.057
All five of you, well done.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.975
I love you, reuel!
You're the best!

30:12.019 --> 30:14.269
Seriously? Gordon wins
the first round?

30:14.271 --> 30:17.022
I mean, his team
was on the top level.

30:17.024 --> 30:19.066
<i> Look out, gordon.</i>
<i> Look out, nyesha.</i>

30:19.109 --> 30:20.100
We're coming for you.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.527
Nyesha and richard,

30:21.529 --> 30:25.322
both of you had to chose
one member from your teams

30:25.366 --> 30:28.116
to go into that
head to head cook-off.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.328
Nyesha,
who are you sending in?

30:35.876 --> 30:38.210
My choice is...

30:43.425 --> 30:47.219
Who are you sending into
that head to head cook-off?

30:47.263 --> 30:50.472
Nyesha:
<i> This person has an amazing</i>
<i> amount of potential,</i>

30:50.516 --> 30:52.307
<i> but I can only</i>
<i> take them so far.</i>

30:52.342 --> 30:54.518
It's up to them to perform.

30:54.562 --> 30:58.438
<i> This cook-off might be</i>
<i> just what this person needs</i>

30:58.482 --> 31:00.399
to bring the intensity
and work under pressure.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.193
Amber.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.362
There's a lot of missing steps

31:05.406 --> 31:07.322
in between the conception
of the dish

31:07.366 --> 31:09.658
and the execution of the cook.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.119
I cannot go home
on a steak challenge.

31:12.162 --> 31:14.663
<i> Steak twice in a row,</i>
<i> as a texan, it's--</i>

31:14.707 --> 31:15.747
it's my favorite food.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.165
It's what I do best.

31:17.209 --> 31:21.545
I'm in shock and disbelief.

31:21.589 --> 31:23.005
Richard, tough decision.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.507
Who are you sending into
the head to head cook-off?

31:25.551 --> 31:27.259
Richard:
<i> We don't want to send anyone</i>
<i> home, but this is tough.</i>

31:27.303 --> 31:28.427
Someone has to go
to the elimination.

31:28.762 --> 31:33.015
<i> Courtney, she hasn't showed up</i>
<i> two plates in a row now.</i>

31:33.017 --> 31:35.267
<i> Gary isn't grabbing</i>
<i> ingredients.</i>

31:35.311 --> 31:38.103
I don't know if he's kind of
in the game, so to speak.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.272
It's a tough decision.

31:40.274 --> 31:44.026
My heart is pounding
at this point.

31:44.028 --> 31:46.361
<i> My hands are like clams.</i>

31:46.405 --> 31:50.073
I have never had clammy hands
in my life ever.

31:50.117 --> 31:55.621
I will send in a chef
who I know has got
some big flavors.

31:55.664 --> 31:59.166
- It's me.
- No, it's me.

31:59.209 --> 32:02.628
It's me. My heart.
My heart is just beating.

32:02.671 --> 32:06.465
My dish has not been
the best dish twice now.

32:08.719 --> 32:11.178
Gary.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.638
You grabbed only three
ingredients today.

32:12.723 --> 32:15.974
I'd like to see a little bit
more cohesion in your dish.

32:16.018 --> 32:20.270
But most importantly,
I think you're gonna grow
from this experience,

32:20.314 --> 32:23.357
and I think you can
take amber down.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.984
Okay. What?

32:26.028 --> 32:28.070
<i> These mentors</i>
<i> are not playing.</i>

32:28.113 --> 32:31.281
Everybody except amber and gary
head to the elevator.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.617
I'll see you on the top floor.

32:33.661 --> 32:35.577
- You got it.
- You got this.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.413
- Cook from your heart.
- You know how to cook. Cook.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.290
- Good luck, good luck.
- Cook.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.543
Each of you struggled earlier
in your attempts

32:43.545 --> 32:45.212
to get your steak
to the next level.

32:45.255 --> 32:48.423
So let's see what you can do
with a feature ingredient

32:48.425 --> 32:52.052
that goes hand in hand
with steak,

32:52.096 --> 32:54.012
and that's wine.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.223
Both of you
will have 30 minutes

32:56.266 --> 33:01.144
to cook one amazing
wine inspired dish.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.188
This is not a position
I really wanted to be in.

33:03.232 --> 33:05.983
<i> Gary needs to cook perfectly.</i>

33:06.026 --> 33:07.150
Team blais has to win here.

33:07.194 --> 33:10.153
Amber, I believe in her.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.948
<i> I want to prove that I have</i>
<i> a good eye for raw talent.</i>

33:12.950 --> 33:14.408
<i> I know she can do it.</i>

33:14.410 --> 33:17.953
We want to give you every
possible chance for survival,

33:17.955 --> 33:23.125
so the platform's
going to remain on the floor
for the entire cook.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.502
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:25.546 --> 33:29.381
This elimination,
I'll be with you
during the cook.

33:29.425 --> 33:34.553
Richard and nyesha will join us
after you've finished cooking.

33:34.555 --> 33:38.015
They will taste blindly,
then decide whose dish is best.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.433
- Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.435
Both of you,
head to the elevator.

33:41.478 --> 33:45.397
Next-level dish,
top floor kitchen.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.735
Gary:
<i> I don't really know</i>
<i> much about amber,</i>

33:49.737 --> 33:51.319
but it's me or her,
at this point,

33:51.363 --> 33:53.989
and I want to send her home
'cause I want to stay here

33:54.033 --> 33:56.074
and I want to be
the next level chef.

33:56.118 --> 33:58.118
Amber:
<i> I wouldn't be here</i>
<i> if I couldn't win this.</i>

33:58.162 --> 34:01.413
I'm just telling myself,
"I don't care what happens.

34:01.457 --> 34:05.167
You do not walk out of here
leaving, period."

34:09.798 --> 34:13.008
holy ( bleep ).

34:13.043 --> 34:16.094
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- That's a kitchen.

34:16.138 --> 34:20.348
You get into the upstairs
and it's like you just walked
into a ferrari dealership.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.391
This is great.

34:24.354 --> 34:28.398
Right, if there's ever a time
for a next-level dish,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.525
it's right now.
There's a lot at stake.

34:31.612 --> 34:34.988
Your 30 minutes start...

34:35.032 --> 34:36.031
...Now.

34:36.033 --> 34:38.742
Let's go, guys. Off we go.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.536
One wine-inspired dish.

34:41.538 --> 34:44.164
If it's a white wine/red wine
reduction, get the wine on.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.791
Y'all got this,
y'all got this.

34:45.793 --> 34:47.417
Do what you know,
and do it well.

34:47.461 --> 34:50.003
Gary:<i> First thing I grab</i>
<i> is the pork tenderloin.</i>

34:50.047 --> 34:52.089
I love cooking
with pork at home.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.466
<i> It's one of my staples</i>
<i> in barbecue,</i>

34:54.510 --> 34:57.969
<i> and I feel comfortable</i>
<i> working with it.</i>

34:57.971 --> 35:01.223
Okay, good.
Chicken breast.

35:01.266 --> 35:03.433
Amber:
<i> Chicken really gets people.</i>

35:03.477 --> 35:05.769
If you undercook it,
you're going to the hospital.

35:05.813 --> 35:08.230
If you overcook it, you're
having an unpleasant meal.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.731
<i> So it's a pretty big risk.</i>

35:10.109 --> 35:13.026
- Nice pans.
- All right, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.737
Why pork tenderloin
on a night like tonight?

35:15.781 --> 35:18.865
Very little fat
and an absolute nightmare
to get right.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.992
- Tell me about it.
- I'm gonna grill it
in medallions.

35:21.036 --> 35:22.786
So, grilled medallions
of pork with what?

35:22.788 --> 35:24.204
Garlic and white wine sauce.

35:24.248 --> 35:26.164
That's good.
Think about it visually, okay?

35:26.166 --> 35:28.750
Elevate that thing.
22 minutes to go.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.627
- Watch that reduction.
Good luck.
- Thank you, chef.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.090
Right, tell me,
how you feeling?

35:35.092 --> 35:40.053
Chaotic, but I have got
a lemon butter white wine sauce
that I like doing.

35:40.097 --> 35:41.263
Gotcha. And how are you
going to elevate--

35:41.265 --> 35:43.181
there's also some
white wine in that rice.

35:43.225 --> 35:44.266
Okay, cook that nice and slow

35:44.268 --> 35:45.934
so you don't boil
that rice, okay?

35:45.978 --> 35:49.813
- Okay.
- There you go. Good.

35:49.815 --> 35:50.647
- Whoo!
- Oh, no, no.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.399
- Whoo!
- Put it down, put it down.

35:52.401 --> 35:56.194
- Put it down. Let it burn.
- All right.

35:56.238 --> 35:57.445
What it's like cooking
with gordon ramsay

35:57.447 --> 35:59.322
is probably what it's like
playing basketball

35:59.366 --> 36:01.241
- with michael jordan.
- That's it.

36:01.285 --> 36:04.661
You are out on the court
with the top of the top.

36:04.705 --> 36:07.747
You want to impress them,
but more than anything,

36:07.749 --> 36:10.083
you just don't want
to screw up.

36:10.127 --> 36:13.920
- 18 minutes to go, yes?
- Thank you, chef.

36:13.964 --> 36:17.465
- Good job, gary.
- Okay, all right.
On the bias, beautiful.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.551
Let's start thinking
about those potatoes
and brussels sprouts.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.136
- Excuse me.
- Go.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.220
Gary:
<i> There's a lot going on.</i>

36:22.264 --> 36:24.139
<i> I'm not used to</i>
<i> this environment.</i>

36:24.183 --> 36:27.058
It's hectic, it's chaotic,
it's intimidating.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.560
Gary, you got this.
You know what you're doing.

36:28.562 --> 36:29.519
It makes you sweat.

36:29.563 --> 36:30.604
( bleep )

36:30.647 --> 36:32.314
I just burnt the sauce.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.857
- I scorched it.
- It's all right,
it's all right.

36:33.901 --> 36:35.525
- Breathe, gary, breathe.
- You got it.

36:35.986 --> 36:39.529
It's a crucial part of the dish.
It has to be there to actually
make this dish work.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.115
- You good. Take a breath.
- This the last thing I need

36:42.159 --> 36:43.950
when I only have 30 minutes
to make this dish.

36:43.994 --> 36:45.577
( bleep )

36:51.710 --> 36:53.460
( bleep )
I just burnt the sauce.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.296
( bleep )

36:56.340 --> 36:58.590
- what happened?
- I burnt the sauce.

36:58.634 --> 37:00.383
- How'd you burn it?
- I wasn't monitoring it.

37:00.427 --> 37:01.843
Come on, come on, come on.
You still got 15 minutes to go.

37:02.304 --> 37:07.557
So now I start over.
It's a pretty simple sauce.
Just start it over.

37:11.647 --> 37:13.647
Pyet: Why are you using
a paring knife to do that?

37:13.690 --> 37:15.315
Girl, I don't know.

37:16.568 --> 37:20.403
There you go.
Cook like a chef, baby.

37:20.447 --> 37:21.363
Five minutes to go.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.656
Amber:
<i> What I'm concerned about</i>

37:22.699 --> 37:24.324
<i> with my dish is the chicken.</i>

37:24.368 --> 37:26.284
This is not cooking at all.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.954
Heat's-- I'm gonna take it
last minute.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.665
Last minute.
It's not going quick enough.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.292
I am shaking in my boots.

37:34.294 --> 37:37.504
Gordon:
Sixty seconds to go.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.205
Everything you put
on that plate now

37:39.216 --> 37:41.091
is worth a quarter
million dollars, come on!

37:41.134 --> 37:43.176
Next level, I told you.
Let's go!

37:44.513 --> 37:45.512
It's gorgeous.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.432
Get your sauce on there, man!

37:49.434 --> 37:52.394
- Your sauce, gary!
- Taste it!

37:52.437 --> 37:54.020
- Okay, awesome.
- Good job, gary.

37:54.064 --> 37:58.024
All:
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

37:58.026 --> 38:02.946
Six, five, four,
three, two, one.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.198
- Gordon: And stop.
- Great job, guys!

38:05.242 --> 38:08.743
( cheers and applause )

38:08.745 --> 38:10.161
great job.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.205
Thank you. Thank you, chef.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.624
That's the best dish ever.

38:14.668 --> 38:16.126
( laughter )

38:16.169 --> 38:18.545
it just hit me.

38:18.588 --> 38:20.380
This is a confidence I haven't
experienced here yet.

38:20.424 --> 38:22.215
I know this is a good dish,

38:22.259 --> 38:25.093
and, quite frankly,
I would like to eat it.

38:28.098 --> 38:30.390
Gordon:
Right, both of you, well done.

38:30.434 --> 38:34.227
Now I'm going to ask you
that you do not reveal
who cooked what dish

38:34.271 --> 38:39.065
because richard and nyesha
are tasting these blind.

38:39.109 --> 38:41.985
Super, super professional,
is that clear?

38:42.029 --> 38:43.194
Yes, chef.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.324
Gary:
<i> I'm pretty confident</i>
<i> in what I made.</i>

38:47.367 --> 38:49.617
<i> I made a sauce that I love.</i>

38:49.661 --> 38:51.161
<i> Meat is my wheelhouse.</i>

38:51.163 --> 38:53.955
I think I nailed this dish.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.291
Nyesha, richard,
two incredible dishes.

38:56.335 --> 39:01.421
One's a pork tenderloin
with sprouts, potatoes.

39:01.465 --> 39:04.424
And the other one
is a chicken breast
with rice, broccolini.

39:04.468 --> 39:09.346
Both used white wine
across their dishes--
the hero of the dish.

39:11.266 --> 39:14.351
Nyesha:
<i> It's very challenging</i>
<i> to send one of your own in</i>

39:14.353 --> 39:16.269
<i> because they're all</i>
<i> kind of like my babies.</i>

39:16.313 --> 39:18.480
But at the end of the day,

39:18.523 --> 39:21.191
<i> I'm looking</i>
<i> for the next level chef.</i>

39:21.234 --> 39:23.234
Gordon:
We'll start with the chicken.

39:23.278 --> 39:26.738
You have to be insane
to cook chicken breast
in a moment like this.

39:26.740 --> 39:29.157
'cause if you undercook it,
you're gonna get destroyed.

39:29.201 --> 39:32.202
If you overcook it,
it's gonna be dry.

39:36.166 --> 39:39.417
It was cooked just right.

39:39.419 --> 39:41.419
But I would have loved to see
a little bit more punch.

39:41.463 --> 39:46.007
- Interesting.
- I want some modern flavor,
a little bit of spice.

39:46.009 --> 39:47.300
Butter sauce, delicious.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.302
I definitely get a pronounced
wine flavor.

39:49.346 --> 39:52.263
If anything, I would say
a little salt to elevate it,

39:52.307 --> 39:53.765
take it on-- on a journey.

39:55.102 --> 39:58.144
Let's move to the pork, please.

40:04.653 --> 40:07.112
I'm not reading wine.

40:07.114 --> 40:10.281
The pork is seasoned well.
The dish is cohesive.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.159
Richard:
I'm picking up the wine.
I get the acidity.

40:13.203 --> 40:16.329
My knock on this dish
is where's the personality?

40:16.373 --> 40:18.998
This is a moment where you
gotta let us know who you are.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.002
This is the moment.
But two tasty dishes.

40:24.131 --> 40:28.591
Nyesha, the winning dish,
in your mind?

40:28.635 --> 40:31.094
This is brutal, but ultimately,

40:31.138 --> 40:33.596
I'm going to pick the dish
that is the tastiest,

40:33.640 --> 40:35.181
<i> and I hope it's amber's.</i>

40:35.225 --> 40:39.018
The winning dish for me is...

40:39.020 --> 40:40.520
...The chicken.

40:42.232 --> 40:45.108
If this goes to a tie,
I'm going to have to break that.

40:45.152 --> 40:49.070
Richard blais,
is it the pork or is it
the chicken?

40:49.114 --> 40:51.406
It all comes down to me.
This is not--

40:51.450 --> 40:54.117
<i> of course, I'd like</i>
<i> my team to advance.</i>

40:54.161 --> 40:55.535
<i> I don't know</i>
<i> whose dish is who.</i>

40:55.537 --> 40:58.746
I just have to pick the dish
that I preferred here.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.165
<i> I hope that's gary's dish.</i>

41:00.208 --> 41:03.084
The winning dish...

41:03.128 --> 41:04.335
...The chicken.

41:06.465 --> 41:08.506
Congratulations, amber.

41:08.550 --> 41:11.342
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

41:14.014 --> 41:16.297
I am so grateful
that I'm still on my journey.

41:16.299 --> 41:18.266
I know that it's
by the skin of my teeth.

41:18.268 --> 41:20.894
<i> This is not cooking at home.</i>

41:20.896 --> 41:23.146
What's good enough for home
is not good enough for here,

41:23.190 --> 41:25.482
and I have got to level up.

41:27.277 --> 41:28.818
Gordon:
Which means, gary,

41:28.862 --> 41:31.738
unfortunately you will not be
the next level chef.

41:31.781 --> 41:35.200
But, young man, I don't think
we've seen the last of you.

41:35.243 --> 41:38.703
<i> It definitely sucks that</i>
<i> it's me to go home first.</i>

41:38.747 --> 41:41.706
Second one, fine.
First one, no.

41:41.750 --> 41:44.000
<i> But this is not the last</i>
<i> you're gonna hear from me.</i>

41:44.002 --> 41:45.585
- Good job, gary.
- Good job.

41:45.629 --> 41:49.631
- I'm just getting started.
- Bye, gary.

41:54.095 --> 41:56.054
- Tough.
- Very difficult.

41:56.097 --> 41:57.347
Richard:
<i> Team trailblaisers,</i>

41:57.390 --> 42:00.725
we lose our first player
in the game.

42:00.727 --> 42:02.268
<i> I got four players left,</i>

42:02.312 --> 42:04.062
<i> but they're</i>
<i> four dynamite chefs,</i>

42:04.105 --> 42:06.272
<i> great stories,</i>
<i> lots of personality,</i>

42:06.316 --> 42:08.608
and even more importantly,
delicious food.

42:08.652 --> 42:10.401
If you thought this was tough,

42:10.445 --> 42:14.030
wait till you see us
next time.

42:14.074 --> 42:16.407
Cook knowing that it could
be your last time.

42:16.451 --> 42:22.121
Listen to your mentors.
We want the best. Good night.

42:22.165 --> 42:24.123
- Good night.
- Night, chefs.

42:24.167 --> 42:28.127
- Thank you, chefs.
- Thank you.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.380
- Amber, you killed it.
- Girl!

42:30.423 --> 42:33.216
Y'all, I'm grateful
to all of you.

42:36.263 --> 42:38.096
Gordon:<i> Next time</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

42:38.181 --> 42:41.891
Your main challenge for today
is devoted to Italy.

42:41.935 --> 42:45.186
- Let's go.
- I make money with meatballs.
I'm in this to win it.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.313
I grabbed the lobster.

42:47.357 --> 42:50.149
I have never cooked
a live lobster.

42:50.151 --> 42:53.152
I'm making rookie mistakes.
Oh, my god. Come on.

42:53.154 --> 42:54.112
Courtney:
Jonathan is a hot mess.

42:54.364 --> 42:56.114
Jonathan: We have to
completely start over.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.157
( bleep ) I could be in
the bottom two today.

42:58.159 --> 42:59.200
What's happening right now?

42:59.494 --> 43:01.411
Chef ramsay is always like,
"expect surprises."

43:01.454 --> 43:03.496
okay, but can't they
be good ones?

43:03.540 --> 43:06.207
- Oh, my god.
- Ahh!
