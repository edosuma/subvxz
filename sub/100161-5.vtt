00:15.153 --> 00:16.507
Show me your fuckin' hands!
Hands!

00:24.188 --> 00:27.148
So if we pay him $9 million,

00:27.236 --> 00:30.125
he'll go ahead with the deal
at the lower price.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.240
I'll talk to my father.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.583
Fuckin'...

00:40.671 --> 00:42.296
Oh!

00:46.625 --> 00:48.185

Good morning.

02:28.953 --> 02:30.460
Morning.

02:34.526 --> 02:35.781
You okay?

02:39.515 --> 02:42.281
Yeah. Sure.

02:53.708 --> 02:55.669
Do you want some coffee?

02:57.390 --> 02:59.132
I should probably go.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.460
You say that a lot,
don't you?

03:05.678 --> 03:07.287
I mean,
did it ever occur to you

03:07.375 --> 03:09.507
maybe I'd like to go?

03:10.515 --> 03:12.750
Maybe I'd like to be
the one

03:13.170 --> 03:16.350
to make the big,
dramatic exit.

03:16.695 --> 03:18.117
It's your place.

03:18.458 --> 03:19.945
Yeah, exactly.

03:20.209 --> 03:22.924
You act like you're

If this was 25 years ago,

03:40.250 --> 03:42.375
I'd have put
a fuckin' gun to your head.

03:45.515 --> 03:47.046
How are you, Mr. Sullivan?

03:47.421 --> 03:51.382
I've done pretty good for myself
since you left.

03:52.216 --> 03:54.546
I made the <i>Forbes</i> list.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.296
Who knew?

03:56.588 --> 04:00.351
Some might say, um,
you picked the wrong horse.

04:03.245 --> 04:06.960
So things didn't
pan out for you in Hollywood,

04:07.153 --> 04:08.929
workin' for that Jew?

04:10.072 --> 04:11.687
Ezra.

04:12.499 --> 04:14.375
I heard about your father, Ray.

04:14.915 --> 04:16.507
My condolences.

04:17.836 --> 04:20.903
I recall that
you didn't think too highly of him.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.263
Your father.
Huh?

04:27.157 --> 04:28.927
So what are you up to now, Ray?

04:30.257 --> 04:31.904
You broke with the mayor?

04:32.697 --> 04:33.945
I should go.

04:34.033 --> 04:36.185
That's a hell of a picture
you got of Kevin.

04:36.654 --> 04:38.948
Fucked him up really good.

04:40.104 --> 04:41.411
I gave it back.

04:41.789 --> 04:44.974
I'd like to pay you.
For assurances.

04:45.715 --> 04:47.333
It's not necessary.

04:49.029 --> 04:50.654
Good to see you, Ray.

04:52.055 --> 04:53.849
Don't be a stranger.

05:00.955 --> 05:02.982
'77 Brinks heist.

05:03.299 --> 05:06.310
Who set it up?
Who was it?

05:08.346 --> 05:09.927
It was your mother.

05:10.015 --> 05:13.997
Uh, she needed the money
for your late‐term abortion.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.505
Oh!

05:17.561 --> 05:19.161
Don't fuck around.

05:19.401 --> 05:21.365
Who are you?
Who are you?

05:22.006 --> 05:24.575
I'm the Cisco Kid.
What's the difference who I am?

05:25.158 --> 05:29.450
Look, you want me to break
both your legs, I can do that.

05:30.076 --> 05:32.981
Or maybe you can just tell me
and you can walk away healthy.

05:33.225 --> 05:34.247
Who was it?

05:34.335 --> 05:36.098
It was Jimmy Sullivan,
wasn't it?

05:37.008 --> 05:39.340
Why are you
protecting that scum?

05:40.177 --> 05:42.020
Last time, Doyle.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.395
Who was the double dealer?

05:45.700 --> 05:47.192
Fuck you.

All right.

05:50.454 --> 05:52.325
You should take this hose,
Mick.

05:52.543 --> 05:54.117
Shove it down his throat.

05:54.227 --> 05:57.708
I'll turn on the spigot,
he'll talk.

05:58.452 --> 06:01.477

I knew it was you.

06:01.586 --> 06:05.516
You fuckin' rat bastard
piece of shit.

06:07.244 --> 06:09.582
Mickey Donovan is dead.

06:10.198 --> 06:12.380
I have to listen
to this fuckin' shit?

06:12.491 --> 06:14.387
You stole my fuckin' life.

06:14.526 --> 06:17.379
‐ You want this? Here.
‐ Hey. Oh, no, no, no, Mick.

06:17.467 --> 06:18.646
‐ No, no, don't...
‐ This... here.

06:18.733 --> 06:20.489
‐ Don't do this.
‐ That's it. That's it.

06:20.577 --> 06:22.709
‐ Mickey, no!
‐ Here. You're gonna love it.

06:22.797 --> 06:25.766
‐ Here. Turn it on!
‐ Ahh!

06:25.854 --> 06:27.073
There.

06:27.161 --> 06:28.770
Yeah, you like that?
You like that?

06:28.858 --> 06:29.848
‐ Isn't that nice?
‐

06:29.936 --> 06:31.620
All right, okay.
All right, all right.

06:31.708 --> 06:32.998
‐ Turn it off.
‐

06:33.120 --> 06:35.456
All right, you wanna talk?
There, yeah.

06:35.544 --> 06:38.174
‐ You had enough?
‐

06:38.628 --> 06:40.813
Who was it?
Who the fuck was it?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.853
It was ma... O'Malley.
O'Malley.

06:42.940 --> 06:44.625
Your fuckin' buddy O'Malley,
huh?

06:44.713 --> 06:46.961
‐ Yeah, he set it up.
‐ Yeah.

06:47.049 --> 06:48.400
Where is he now?

06:48.487 --> 06:49.680
He's got dementia!

06:49.775 --> 06:51.762
He... he won't know anything.

06:51.897 --> 06:53.926
- Oh, fuck.
- Where is he?

06:54.582 --> 06:57.697
Patterson.
He's... he's in a... in a...

06:57.785 --> 07:01.371
in a home, uh...
close to his boy.

07:01.841 --> 07:04.356
Oh...

07:04.451 --> 07:07.916
- I appreciate your help.
- Fuck you, Mick.

07:09.041 --> 07:12.657
Mickey Donovan died
in an oil truck explosion.

07:12.753 --> 07:14.213
Look it up.

07:15.104 --> 07:16.495
Okay, that's it.

07:24.582 --> 07:26.377
Okay, Pop.
Like, what now?

07:26.465 --> 07:28.364
I mean,
he knows you're alive.

07:28.856 --> 07:30.809
It don't matter.
He won't talk.

07:31.295 --> 07:33.127
We're on the path, kid.

07:33.292 --> 07:36.090
‐ Don't worry so much.
‐ "We're on the path," okay.

07:43.883 --> 07:47.457
You're a ghost, Mick.
Let's fuckin' keep it that way.

07:52.941 --> 07:54.543
Did you
shoot that guy?

08:52.473 --> 08:53.565
Hello?

08:53.653 --> 08:55.356
<i>You motherfucker.</i>

08:56.281 --> 08:57.321
What?

08:57.408 --> 08:59.832
You and your company
are fucking suing me?

09:00.717 --> 09:02.143
Who is this?

09:02.231 --> 09:05.287
I just got fucking served
with papers in my kid's room.

09:05.450 --> 09:09.129
‐ In his room.
‐ Ah... I'm not part of that.

09:09.256 --> 09:12.067
<i>Then why is your fuckin' name
all over it, huh?</i>

09:13.386 --> 09:15.074
I took that thing,

09:15.191 --> 09:18.007
- <i>and I threw it in the garbage.</i>
- Oh, the fuck you did.

09:18.242 --> 09:19.791
I swear to God.

09:19.887 --> 09:21.418
Fuck you did.

09:26.167 --> 09:27.590
Hey.

09:33.861 --> 09:35.348
You all right?

09:37.090 --> 09:38.621
Is he, uh...

09:39.024 --> 09:41.457
I need that money.

09:42.126 --> 09:44.871
I need them to pay me
for what you fuckin' did.

09:45.456 --> 09:48.285
I need to get my kid
out of this fuckin' place.

09:49.237 --> 09:50.535
Okay.

09:51.059 --> 09:53.239
Like, where do you need
to move him?

09:54.441 --> 09:55.734
There's this guy

09:55.822 --> 09:57.971
over at the Hospital
for Special Surgery.

09:58.059 --> 10:00.531
Top rated spinal surgeon,
and he's our best chance

10:00.619 --> 10:01.751
if Mateo's ever
gonna walk again,

10:01.838 --> 10:04.033
but they don't take Medicaid,
so...

10:08.874 --> 10:11.472
God damn it, never mind.
You know what? Fuck you.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.994
<i>Fuck you.</i>

10:13.486 --> 10:14.981
No, wait.

10:26.044 --> 10:27.911
Where do you wanna start today?

10:32.005 --> 10:33.372
I met someone.

10:33.646 --> 10:36.294
‐ A woman?
‐ I knew her when I was a kid.

10:36.841 --> 10:38.667
Well, I didn't know her.

10:38.914 --> 10:43.057
Well... she's younger than me,
but I knew her father.

10:43.753 --> 10:45.534
How do you feel?

10:48.698 --> 10:50.510
I had to ask.

10:58.315 --> 10:59.568
She's nice.

10:59.846 --> 11:01.027
Really?

11:01.682 --> 11:03.362
Maybe too nice.

11:04.542 --> 11:06.116
Why do you say that?

11:06.870 --> 11:08.799
Too nice for someone like me.

11:09.807 --> 11:12.407
‐ Someone like you?
‐ Yeah, you know, someone who's

11:12.495 --> 11:14.581
fucked up every relationship
he's ever had.

11:16.618 --> 11:18.831
So you're afraid
you're not reliable.

11:21.970 --> 11:23.729
You think you can change, Ray.

11:26.745 --> 11:27.977
You think the work we do here

11:28.065 --> 11:30.003
can help you
do things differently.

11:31.146 --> 11:32.464
I don't know.

11:37.943 --> 11:39.885
Maybe we better
talk about this.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.574
‐ What?
‐ This. The Parkinson's.

11:45.590 --> 11:47.524
‐ Why?
‐ The time will come

11:47.612 --> 11:50.042
when I won't be able
to practice anymore.

11:51.075 --> 11:52.698
But that's not today.

11:53.573 --> 11:55.883
When it's coming, I'll be able
to give you fair warning

11:55.971 --> 11:59.479
and help you to...
help you to transition to someone else.

12:01.112 --> 12:03.034
What do you mean,
someone else?

12:03.395 --> 12:05.096
Someone else.

12:08.551 --> 12:10.464
Is this upsetting you, Ray?

12:25.207 --> 12:26.762
<i>This is Terry.
Leave a message.</i>

12:26.877 --> 12:29.025
‐ Terry, answer
your fuckin' phone, will you?

12:30.373 --> 12:33.418
Can you take me
to Church and Duane, please?

12:50.552 --> 12:51.992
Ter?

12:55.799 --> 12:57.312
It's open.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.460
You all right?

13:16.588 --> 13:18.679
I'm... I'm just tired.

13:19.317 --> 13:21.232
I been in bed.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.872
Three fuckin days?

13:24.174 --> 13:26.247
I took a trip upstate.

13:27.177 --> 13:28.258
With who?

13:29.005 --> 13:31.591
It don't matter.
I'm back now.

13:36.255 --> 13:39.458
‐ You takin' your meds?
‐ I threw 'em away.

13:39.835 --> 13:42.645
‐ What?
‐ I met a shaman.

13:43.539 --> 13:45.333
‐ A what?
‐

13:46.049 --> 13:47.411
Never mind.

13:47.948 --> 13:50.020
Oh.

13:56.123 --> 13:57.341
Oh, Jesus Christ.

13:57.894 --> 14:00.011
‐ You're out of food.
‐ I'm fine.

14:00.099 --> 14:01.886
No, you're not fine, Terry.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.349
Am I out of beer?

14:03.459 --> 14:04.856
No, you got three beers.

14:05.003 --> 14:06.419
Then I'm fine.

14:07.637 --> 14:09.090
You gotta eat, Ter.

14:09.528 --> 14:11.645
And you gotta take your meds,
all right?

14:21.509 --> 14:23.044
Hey, Bunchy?

14:23.767 --> 14:26.895
M‐Michael's wanting
to talk to you in his office.

14:27.791 --> 14:29.238
All right.

14:38.630 --> 14:40.739
You sign that statement thing
the lawyer gave you?

14:43.886 --> 14:45.425
I threw it away.

14:46.474 --> 14:48.497
You threw the statement away?
Why?

14:49.246 --> 14:50.872
'Cause it ain't the truth.

14:51.472 --> 14:54.085
That's not what happened.
I can't sign it, all right?

14:54.173 --> 14:55.993
If... if we get sued...

14:57.058 --> 14:58.430
so be it.

14:59.068 --> 15:01.368
Then clear out your locker,
please.

15:04.438 --> 15:08.094
Okay, so you're...
you're really gonna fire me?

15:08.305 --> 15:11.633
Value Drugs
has a clearly defined policy.

15:11.750 --> 15:14.041
If a robbery occurs,
we don't interfere.

15:14.129 --> 15:15.497
You're gonna fire me
'cause I was trying

15:15.584 --> 15:17.668
‐ to do the right thing.
‐ Company policy.

15:20.289 --> 15:22.208
Fuck this company.

15:23.502 --> 15:26.035
Fuck 'em.
Fuck you.

15:26.392 --> 15:27.707
Fuck you people!

Fuck you.

You're welcome.

16:13.611 --> 16:15.004
Sit up.

16:15.863 --> 16:17.089
Come on.

16:17.764 --> 16:19.785
I mean it, you gotta
take your pills, Ter.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.863
Fuck!

16:39.703 --> 16:41.980
Well, gimme a fuckin' beer!

16:58.949 --> 17:00.699
You gotta take care
of yourself, Ter.

17:01.012 --> 17:02.737
Yeah?
Look who's talkin'.

17:06.519 --> 17:09.457
‐ Yeah?
‐ Hey Dad, I found your car.

17:09.574 --> 17:10.769
Please don't call me that.

17:10.857 --> 17:12.355
<i>Right, yeah, sorry.
Um, it's at</i>

17:12.443 --> 17:15.651

17:15.810 --> 17:19.066
Uh, Cyclone, like the ride.
It's in, uh, Coney Island.

17:19.154 --> 17:20.492
Hey, babe.

17:20.654 --> 17:23.894
‐ What?
‐ Oh, uh, not you. Bye.

17:24.247 --> 17:27.199
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

17:28.113 --> 17:29.597
I'm going to Coney Island.

17:30.502 --> 17:32.470
‐ What for?
‐ My car's there.

17:32.558 --> 17:33.832
You're comin' with me.

17:36.230 --> 17:37.382
Come on.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.346
What's wrong? I thought
you were going to work today.

17:43.433 --> 17:45.503
I am. I thought, um...

17:45.685 --> 17:48.003
Uh... do you wanna
go to breakfast

17:48.105 --> 17:49.642
or just do something today?

17:49.730 --> 17:51.550
Why?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.308
I don't know. I thought...
I thought it'd be fun.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.097
Well, I mean, I...
I can't leave.

17:57.589 --> 17:59.673
I just started working here.

17:59.761 --> 18:01.931
‐ I could call my dad.
‐ Don't do that.

18:02.019 --> 18:03.239
I... I don't want you
calling your dad

18:03.326 --> 18:05.175
asking for favors for me,
that's...

18:07.105 --> 18:08.652
Are you okay?

18:14.089 --> 18:16.339
I didn't work late
the other night.

18:18.332 --> 18:19.894
So what does that mean?

18:24.367 --> 18:26.355
I slept with Adam Rain.

18:27.465 --> 18:28.660
What?

18:29.878 --> 18:32.519
- I slept...
‐ No, I heard what you fuckin' said.

18:34.455 --> 18:36.050
Holy shit.

18:37.570 --> 18:39.191
Holy shit.

18:40.308 --> 18:43.238
It was a mistake.
It won't happen again.

18:49.466 --> 18:51.206
Please say something.

18:54.237 --> 18:56.001
Oh, don't cry.

18:56.089 --> 18:57.921
‐ Yeah... what... why not?
‐ Yell at me.

18:58.008 --> 18:59.262
‐ What?
‐ Call me a piece of shit!

18:59.349 --> 19:00.198
‐ Scream.
‐ I don't yell.

19:00.286 --> 19:01.934
- Tell me I'm an awful fucking person.
‐ I don't hit.

19:02.021 --> 19:04.113
Do something.

19:05.885 --> 19:08.554
Stop it.
Just fucking stop it!

19:24.224 --> 19:26.206
You're doing
that therapy thing?

19:26.793 --> 19:29.573
Yeah.
Why?

19:30.464 --> 19:32.962
No reason.
Just askin'.

19:35.802 --> 19:37.144
It help?

19:39.237 --> 19:40.922
I don't know.

19:41.159 --> 19:43.206
Yeah, maybe.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.847
You just talk?

19:47.557 --> 19:50.612
‐ Yeah.
‐ About what?

19:51.308 --> 19:53.003
It's different every time, Ter.

19:53.144 --> 19:56.058
‐ You like the guy?
‐ Yeah.

19:56.675 --> 20:00.136
‐ He's got Parkinson's.
‐ So?

20:00.761 --> 20:02.784
Maybe you should talk to him.

20:02.872 --> 20:04.076
Why?
'Cause he got Parkinson's?

20:04.164 --> 20:05.651
No,
'cause he's a smart guy.

20:06.131 --> 20:08.112
I don't need
a fuckin' therapist.

20:12.262 --> 20:14.681
Seriously, what do you
talk to him about?

20:17.885 --> 20:20.813
Family, mostly.

20:20.901 --> 20:23.464
‐ Mick?
‐ Yeah.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.394
O'Connor?

20:25.810 --> 20:27.050
No.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.751
‐ No?
‐ Not what I'm there for.

20:29.839 --> 20:31.316
Sure.

20:33.318 --> 20:35.284
You got it all worked out, Ray.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.737
I talk about Bridget sometimes.

20:45.386 --> 20:46.808
Yeah?

20:47.767 --> 20:49.120
Yeah.

20:49.222 --> 20:51.165
He get you any answers?

20:52.308 --> 20:54.255
I don't know.

20:58.159 --> 20:59.818
Ah, it's good.

21:00.603 --> 21:03.300
‐ You're trying.
‐ Sure.

21:04.371 --> 21:05.997
It's fuckin' hopeful.

21:13.358 --> 21:15.481
I had breakfast with Bridget.

21:15.987 --> 21:17.730
The day she jumped.

21:19.034 --> 21:20.511
I was training.
You remember?

21:20.740 --> 21:23.322
I used to eat half a dozen eggs
before breakfast,

21:23.409 --> 21:25.956
and I'd make Bridget some.

21:28.769 --> 21:30.378
Yeah, anyway.
We had breakfast.

21:32.698 --> 21:34.878
She was wearing
her school uniform.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.671
And I don't think she said
anything new, and...

21:39.174 --> 21:41.007
I don't think I said
anything more to her than,

21:41.094 --> 21:43.815
"You want eggs?"
And she nodded.

21:47.267 --> 21:50.378
"You want eggs?
Here ya go."

21:51.952 --> 21:53.909
And there you go.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.558
<i>You all know
why you're here.</i>

22:05.869 --> 22:07.581
Kevin, as of
the first of the year,

22:07.747 --> 22:12.862
you will be both CEO and COO
of Sullivan Industries.

22:14.792 --> 22:15.923
Thank you.

22:16.081 --> 22:18.972
Yeah, well,
the competition was slim.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.423
You getting my company
has about the same significance as

22:22.511 --> 22:23.657
when I saw your daughter

22:23.745 --> 22:25.174
gettin' that gold medal
for acrobatics

22:25.261 --> 22:26.768
when she couldn't even
do a summersault

22:26.855 --> 22:29.055
without lookin' like
a dog tryin' to fuck itself.

22:29.142 --> 22:30.495
‐ Jesus.
‐

22:32.761 --> 22:36.675
My, uh, oldest is amused.

22:36.901 --> 22:39.165
It's good to see
the 19 drugs you take

22:39.253 --> 22:40.815
so you won't kill puppies

22:40.995 --> 22:44.612
has miraculously
left that part of your brain

22:44.877 --> 22:47.572
that governs humor intact.

22:47.660 --> 22:49.651
‐ Jim, may I suggest that we...
‐ Sure.

22:49.901 --> 22:52.411
I... I know family dynamics
makes you uncomfortable,

22:52.498 --> 22:54.605
so I'll try to be
more business‐like.

22:55.456 --> 22:56.909
Molly.

22:58.222 --> 23:02.253
You will take over
full control of the foundation,

23:02.503 --> 23:05.253
and you will have
a paid position on the board

23:05.433 --> 23:07.058
and 15% of the company.

23:07.146 --> 23:10.774
And I honestly hope that
you do some good in the world.

23:11.296 --> 23:12.673
Thank you.

23:16.481 --> 23:19.506
Declan,
you will receive a stipend

23:19.594 --> 23:22.319
of $1.2 million a year,

23:22.407 --> 23:24.569
broken up into
monthly installments

23:24.656 --> 23:26.225
for the rest of your time
on this earth,

23:26.313 --> 23:29.884
which can be handed off
only to your children.

23:32.617 --> 23:37.037
You give full control to this
weakling, little faggot,

23:37.125 --> 23:39.397
and you give Molly
access to everything,

23:39.485 --> 23:41.146
but to me...

23:41.234 --> 23:43.253
If this was the old days,

23:43.438 --> 23:46.578
you woulda spent your life
locked in the cellar.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.750
But we live in different times.

23:49.743 --> 23:52.586
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

23:53.125 --> 23:54.664
You want a go at me, son?

23:55.376 --> 23:57.131
I'd break your fuckin' neck

23:57.219 --> 23:59.698
if you weren't already
about to die.

24:06.932 --> 24:09.110
That's the spirit.

24:10.078 --> 24:12.141
That's the spirit.

24:29.313 --> 24:30.545
Hello?

24:30.633 --> 24:32.220
Oh, hey, man.

24:32.477 --> 24:34.559
Uh... Smit... Smitty, right?

24:36.352 --> 24:39.061
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, Hispes.

24:39.149 --> 24:41.164
That's so tight, dude.
Genius.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.477
<i>Uh, is Ray there?</i>

24:43.789 --> 24:45.180
No.

24:45.282 --> 24:49.194
Well, we are still having
some issues here.

24:49.282 --> 24:51.365
Got some fans locked themselves
in the bathroom

24:51.453 --> 24:54.063
saying they won't leave
unless they get Hispes too.

24:54.305 --> 24:57.375
Is there any way
you could send somebody over?

24:59.635 --> 25:01.039
<i>Hello?</i>

25:01.461 --> 25:02.766
Yeah.

25:03.254 --> 25:04.836
Yeah, we'll handle it.

25:05.486 --> 25:07.442
Great. Thanks.

25:54.401 --> 25:57.328
Okay, why do I
gotta get O'Malley out?

25:57.416 --> 25:59.729
'Cause old people
don't get old people

25:59.817 --> 26:02.139
out of old people's homes.

26:02.588 --> 26:05.869
That cloud looks
just like a dolphin.

26:07.362 --> 26:09.860
Dolphins are a special sign
for me in my life.

26:09.948 --> 26:11.666
Like my clover.

26:15.576 --> 26:17.409
Everything's gonna be fine.

26:32.463 --> 26:34.071
Oh, I didn't realize
Mr. O'Malley

26:34.159 --> 26:35.813
had any outside
activities today.

26:35.901 --> 26:38.383
Yes, uh,
Mr. O'Malley's son Ronnie,

26:38.471 --> 26:40.536
uh, called and asked
if I could bring his father

26:40.623 --> 26:41.651
to aquatic aerobics.

26:41.739 --> 26:43.491
Oh, isn't that nice?

26:46.412 --> 26:49.088
Doesn't Mr. O'Malley
need his bathing suit?

27:18.866 --> 27:21.243
That's a long
fuckin' breakfast.

27:22.674 --> 27:24.362
What do you wanna do?

27:28.432 --> 27:29.979
Come on.

27:42.908 --> 27:45.092
‐ She's my wife.
‐ Hey, hey, take it easy.

27:45.180 --> 27:46.522
Take it easy!
Fuck!

27:46.610 --> 27:48.803
No! Ahh! Ohh!

27:49.167 --> 27:51.576
God! Ow!

27:51.761 --> 27:53.676
‐ Ohh!
‐ She's my fuckin' wife!

27:53.951 --> 27:55.443
Ohh, God!

27:55.531 --> 27:58.881
Ohh! God!

28:16.608 --> 28:17.936
Let's do it.

28:39.723 --> 28:41.600
O'Malley...

28:42.197 --> 28:44.320
you remember the Brinks heist

28:44.649 --> 28:46.123
when they fucked
Mickey Donovan?

28:46.211 --> 28:48.522
Do you remember that?

28:50.818 --> 28:52.545
Yaz.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.451
Four.

28:56.464 --> 28:58.756
Four for four.

29:00.066 --> 29:01.576
Four for four?

29:01.707 --> 29:03.904
Yaz went four for four.

29:04.408 --> 29:06.389
1967.

29:06.477 --> 29:07.678
That's it.
That's it!

29:07.980 --> 29:10.149
Oh, Pop.
This guy is gone.

29:10.237 --> 29:12.292
But he's really answering me
in a way.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.660
'Cause we snuck into that game.

29:14.747 --> 29:16.909
Him and me and Sullivan.

29:17.028 --> 29:19.017
We hopped the fence
and we watch Carl Yastrzemski...

29:19.104 --> 29:22.596
the Yaz...
hit four fuckin' home runs

29:22.750 --> 29:25.249
and get the Sox
into the postseason.

29:25.407 --> 29:26.987
‐ Oof.
‐

29:27.687 --> 29:29.393
Well, at least
he can remember that.

29:29.504 --> 29:31.282
Yeah, he's got it all up there.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.003
He's got it all in there.
We just gotta get it out.

29:34.091 --> 29:36.057
Hey, hey.

29:36.168 --> 29:38.712
Remember fingerbangin' me
behind the rectory

29:38.800 --> 29:40.729
when we were 15?

29:40.817 --> 29:42.857
Huh?

29:43.233 --> 29:45.448
Come on.

‐ Don't embarrass yourself.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.297
Yeah, do you
remember Canobie Park?

30:19.399 --> 30:20.960
‐ The roller coaster?
‐ Yeah.

30:21.048 --> 30:24.218
Yeah, you screamed like a girl
the whole fuckin' ride.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.764
‐ That was you, Ter.
‐ No, it wasn't.

30:28.011 --> 30:31.094
It was. I think you even
pissed yourself.

30:32.350 --> 30:34.365
Oh, fuck.

30:36.329 --> 30:38.706
Oh, what the fuck?

30:41.918 --> 30:45.004
‐ Whoo!
‐ Oh, fuck! Fuck!

31:09.170 --> 31:11.420
Oh, this is my favorite spot.

31:11.585 --> 31:14.256
We used to grow
hydroponic pot out here.

31:14.428 --> 31:17.795
‐ It's got everything.
‐ Yeah, it's beautiful.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.545
‐ It's perfect.
‐ I'll get the cables.

31:22.168 --> 31:24.374
There's a chair made for us.

31:24.659 --> 31:26.413
Put him in this.
Come on.

31:26.501 --> 31:27.656
Wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

31:27.743 --> 31:29.449
What are you guys
gonna do to him?

31:29.881 --> 31:31.710
We're gonna give his mind
a little jolt.

31:31.798 --> 31:33.874
Jump‐start his memory.
Come on.

31:38.615 --> 31:40.655
Whoa, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

31:40.789 --> 31:42.702
You're gonna electrocute
this dude?

31:43.771 --> 31:45.670
Don't worry about it.

31:46.732 --> 31:48.788
<i>We know what we're doing.</i>

31:48.944 --> 31:51.327
<i>The brain...</i>

31:52.538 --> 31:54.139
is electricity.

31:54.227 --> 31:55.678
‐ That's all it is.
‐ No, no.

31:55.766 --> 31:57.681
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Pop.
Come on, now.

31:57.788 --> 31:59.579
I mean, you... you're not gonna
get anything from this guy.

31:59.666 --> 32:01.692
He's fuckin' old.
He's gone.

32:01.780 --> 32:04.950
Some great people were helped
by electric shock.

32:05.038 --> 32:06.791
Ju... Judy Garland.

32:07.335 --> 32:09.335
There was
a Russian piano player.

32:09.874 --> 32:10.903
Can't remember his name.

32:10.991 --> 32:11.962
- Dick Cavett.
- Who?

32:12.049 --> 32:13.297
Talk show host.

32:22.886 --> 32:24.384
Ahh!

32:24.604 --> 32:27.186
‐ Ahh!
‐ Ho... holy shit!

32:27.273 --> 32:28.437
What the fuck?

32:28.524 --> 32:31.616
Ahh! Mick! Daryll!

32:34.530 --> 32:35.569
Help me!

32:42.332 --> 32:44.591
Ahh! Fuck!

32:44.679 --> 32:45.951
Ahh!

32:46.039 --> 32:47.343
Ohh!

32:47.716 --> 32:49.389
Fuck!

33:00.310 --> 33:01.857
What the fuck?

33:33.089 --> 33:34.883
Yeah, he's coming around.
See?

33:37.328 --> 33:40.425
What happened with the heist?

33:40.691 --> 33:42.159
Tell me.

33:43.118 --> 33:45.534
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:46.518 --> 33:48.401
Oh, fuck you don't.

33:48.539 --> 33:51.167
What is this?
What is this?

33:52.186 --> 33:53.559
How'd this end up

33:53.647 --> 33:56.573
in Jim Sullivan's
safety deposit box, huh?

33:57.595 --> 33:59.347
How should I know?

34:00.529 --> 34:02.066
Sandy.

34:02.882 --> 34:05.011
‐ Pop.
‐ Okay, let's do this.

34:05.099 --> 34:06.808
Give me a little juice.

34:12.873 --> 34:14.862
‐ Jesus Christ, Mickey.
‐ Who set it up?

34:14.995 --> 34:18.297
‐ Who set it up?
‐ Jimmy.

34:18.393 --> 34:19.797
‐ Jimmy.
‐ Jimmy.

34:19.893 --> 34:21.511
We needed a fall guy.

34:22.850 --> 34:24.511
That was you.

34:26.284 --> 34:27.953
What about you?

34:30.839 --> 34:32.518
Why did Sullivan
let you skate?

34:32.620 --> 34:34.813
‐ What'd you have on him?
‐ Nothin'.

34:35.261 --> 34:38.734
‐ Don't lie to me.
‐ Nothin'.

34:39.089 --> 34:40.612
Sandy, more juice.

34:40.947 --> 34:43.355
Turn it up, turn it up.

34:48.661 --> 34:50.118
Jesus, Pop!
Will you stop?

34:50.228 --> 34:52.049
Man, you're just
torturing him at this point.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.120
Tapes.

34:55.629 --> 34:56.710
What?

34:56.987 --> 34:58.925
I made tapes.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.642
My office was wired,
and I... I taped

35:05.730 --> 35:09.196
every fucking thing
Jimmy ever said to me.

35:09.284 --> 35:11.167
I knew it.

35:12.148 --> 35:13.894
I knew he had to have
some kinda hold

35:13.982 --> 35:15.775
on that cocksucker!

35:18.448 --> 35:21.417
What'd you do with the tapes?
O'Malley...

35:26.526 --> 35:28.151
O'Malley?

35:33.357 --> 35:35.985
He's dead.
He's gone.

35:36.762 --> 35:39.886
Pop, come on.
I did not sign up for this.

35:49.444 --> 35:52.620
If you two are gonna stand
there and piss in your shoes,

35:53.003 --> 35:55.745
I say we get the fuck
out of here.

36:25.785 --> 36:29.409
God, I miss that...
I miss that feeling.

36:29.737 --> 36:31.151
What feeling?

36:31.340 --> 36:33.881
When we were kids and
you had a body that ran

36:34.015 --> 36:38.191
and you had a mind that just...
just worked good.

36:38.292 --> 36:39.605
Yeah.

36:53.331 --> 36:56.205
‐ Can I ask you somethin'?
‐ Sure.

36:56.487 --> 36:58.736
When the time comes,

36:58.824 --> 37:00.989
I don't wanna be
a fuckin' vegetable.

37:01.145 --> 37:02.811
‐ When the time comes...
‐ Come on, Terry, stop.

37:02.898 --> 37:05.081
See, Abby had it right.

37:05.394 --> 37:07.737
She went out on her own terms.

37:08.140 --> 37:10.878
It's the strongest
fuckin' thing I ever saw.

37:11.158 --> 37:13.449
I know you're not happy
about it, and...

37:13.787 --> 37:16.917
I'm never gonna apologize
because it was the right thing.

37:18.060 --> 37:20.142
Ray, I'm sorry
that I got confused

37:20.230 --> 37:22.316
about how I felt about it,
but...

37:25.363 --> 37:27.339
it was fucked up.

37:28.334 --> 37:29.960
And I'm sorry.

37:33.855 --> 37:35.425
Fuck you.

37:36.673 --> 37:38.175
Thanks.

38:10.461 --> 38:12.003
Open up
the cash register, now.

38:12.146 --> 38:13.936
Now. Come on.

38:14.316 --> 38:16.532
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.183
I'm here to pick up my car.

38:18.271 --> 38:19.877
Yeah, you're gonna have to
come back after lunch.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.532
‐ After lunch?
‐ Well, when we were here

38:22.620 --> 38:24.472
an hour ago, it said
you were out to breakfast.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.776
Yeah, and now
I'm going to lunch.

38:26.995 --> 38:28.238
Look, my car's parked
right there.

38:28.325 --> 38:29.379
You mind if we take care
of this now?

38:29.466 --> 38:30.810
You're gonna have to
come back in an hour.

38:30.897 --> 38:33.558
‐ An hour?
‐ That's what the fuck I said.

38:57.776 --> 38:59.761
Open the fuckin'
cash register, now.

38:59.849 --> 39:00.749
Now.

39:00.837 --> 39:02.698
Put the money in a plastic bag.

39:02.786 --> 39:04.576
Put it in the bag.
Come on!

39:04.664 --> 39:06.245
Hurry the fuck up.

39:34.145 --> 39:35.909
There you go.

39:52.286 --> 39:53.951
What did you do?

39:56.302 --> 39:57.669
Smitty.

39:58.125 --> 39:59.251
Don't fuckin' touch me.

40:01.626 --> 40:03.625
You want me to be like that?

40:04.591 --> 40:06.310
I can be like that.

40:08.443 --> 40:09.928
I didn't mean for you to...

40:10.015 --> 40:11.490
Go fuck yourself.

40:22.776 --> 40:25.787
- The fuck's a shaman?
- I... I actually...

40:25.993 --> 40:28.130
I... I don't really know.

40:28.218 --> 40:30.550
I... I took this drug ayahuasca

40:30.689 --> 40:33.215
'cause I met this pretty girl
in a drug store,

40:33.303 --> 40:35.802
and it gave me visions.

40:35.910 --> 40:37.460
Ah... but I thought
they were prophesies

40:37.547 --> 40:41.630
'cause I... I saw Mick dead,
and then Mick was dead.

40:41.892 --> 40:43.263
But then he wasn't dead,

40:43.351 --> 40:45.202
so all I was doing
was just seeing Mick.

40:45.298 --> 40:47.005
And I can do that myself

40:47.093 --> 40:48.999
without vomiting
and shitting my pants.

40:53.217 --> 40:54.217
Hello?

40:54.446 --> 40:56.358
You were weird this morning.

40:56.569 --> 40:58.147
<i>Why?</i>

41:00.406 --> 41:01.827
I don't know.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.116
Do you not wanna see me again?

41:09.673 --> 41:11.254
Are you there?

41:11.576 --> 41:12.983
Yeah.

41:14.058 --> 41:15.772
Did you just get uncomfortable?

41:16.389 --> 41:19.326
‐ What? Now?
<i>‐ No. This morning.</i>

41:19.490 --> 41:22.522
Oh. Yeah.

41:24.154 --> 41:28.071
I wanna see you tonight.
I wanna talk to you.

41:28.424 --> 41:30.005
Will you meet me?

41:30.553 --> 41:32.928
‐ All right.
<i>‐ Good.</i>

41:33.392 --> 41:35.272
<i>I'll text you an address.</i>

41:44.702 --> 41:46.303
What?

41:47.655 --> 41:49.491
It's good to see you happy.

41:52.017 --> 41:53.627
Fuck!

41:54.408 --> 41:56.531
‐ You all right?
‐ Yeah.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.337
Fuck was that?

42:17.869 --> 42:20.751
‐ Oh, Jesus.
‐ She's in a lot of pain.

42:22.377 --> 42:24.236
She's suffering.

42:28.778 --> 42:30.249
‐ Let's go.
‐ Get your gun.

42:30.337 --> 42:31.720
What?

42:33.401 --> 42:34.947
‐ Get your gun.
‐

43:01.476 --> 43:03.078
Put her down, Ray.

43:04.253 --> 43:06.258
My hand's shaking too bad.

43:08.428 --> 43:10.259
Put her down, please.

44:00.448 --> 44:02.328
You said you needed money.

44:08.540 --> 44:10.102
There's 17 grand in there.

44:26.867 --> 44:28.344
Dad?

44:29.437 --> 44:31.141
Bunchy?

44:46.061 --> 44:48.969
Look, Dr. Goldstein,
the place where he is now,

44:49.507 --> 44:51.349
I don't trust them to fix him.

44:51.437 --> 44:55.648
The appearance of a facility
can be misleading.

44:55.907 --> 44:57.375
Would you want your kid there?

44:59.225 --> 45:02.086
Listen, everything I've read
says you're the best.

45:02.680 --> 45:05.250
And that is what
my son deserves.

45:06.320 --> 45:07.287
Look, Doc,

45:07.375 --> 45:09.898
maybe we could do this
a different way, all right?

45:10.984 --> 45:12.492
We were thinking

45:12.743 --> 45:17.456
maybe you could give us, like,
an all‐cash discount.

45:36.257 --> 45:38.094
Even if I could...

45:39.132 --> 45:41.414
negotiate my fee,

45:42.365 --> 45:44.320
the hospital stay would be...
I'm guessing...

45:44.408 --> 45:45.992
beyond your means.

45:46.851 --> 45:48.367
I truly think
that you're better off

45:48.455 --> 45:50.094
staying where you are.

45:51.125 --> 45:52.977
It's like that.

45:53.065 --> 45:54.065
He's...

45:54.901 --> 45:57.525
My son is going to be
in a wheelchair

45:57.612 --> 45:59.508
for the rest of
his fucking life.

46:00.258 --> 46:03.352
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

46:05.991 --> 46:08.352
‐ Okay
‐ All right.

46:13.153 --> 46:15.109
Let's get the fuck out of here.

46:37.047 --> 46:40.342
Imagine if you had gotten
your share of that money.

46:42.863 --> 46:44.766
I'd have been
a billion‐fuckin'‐aire.

46:46.688 --> 46:48.477
I'm serious.

46:49.763 --> 46:52.219
I would've made money
with that money.

46:53.448 --> 46:56.156
Remember George Best,
the soccer player?

46:56.563 --> 46:58.711
Yeah. Why?

46:59.001 --> 47:01.547
Well, he lost
all his money, too.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.805
And, uh, he said something
along the lines of,

47:05.102 --> 47:09.094
"I spent all my money
on wine, women, and song.

47:09.481 --> 47:12.735
And the rest
I squandered foolishly."

47:14.434 --> 47:15.899
That ain't me.

47:43.650 --> 47:46.431
‐ You all right?
‐ Yeah, yeah, I just...

47:48.726 --> 47:50.260
Just give me a beer.

48:18.213 --> 48:21.298
You know you can't stay here
much longer, right?

48:25.945 --> 48:28.152
You're gonna come stay
with me and Bunch.

48:28.388 --> 48:29.720
The fuck I am.

48:29.808 --> 48:31.455
It'll be good
for all of us.

48:33.158 --> 48:34.697
Fuck you.

48:34.928 --> 48:38.791
I li... like it here.
I'm fine.

48:38.879 --> 48:41.673
Will you stop saying that?
You're not fuckin' fine.

48:44.805 --> 48:49.095
Do you remember the, uh,
the song Mom sang?

48:49.619 --> 48:50.986
What?

48:51.630 --> 48:53.892
When she was
puttin' us to bed.

48:55.605 --> 48:57.454
The Irish one.

48:57.775 --> 48:59.259
