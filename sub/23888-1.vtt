01:21.833 --> 01:24.708
There is
major internal tissue damage.

01:25.791 --> 01:29.791
I'm not promising we can repair it,
but if we don't try,

01:29.875 --> 01:33.541
Leo will never be able to talk.

01:33.625 --> 01:36.125
Your son deserves that we do our best.

01:36.208 --> 01:40.250
I understand you have your own beliefs,

01:40.333 --> 01:44.708
but sometimes the good Lord does
his best work through human hands.

01:48.291 --> 01:49.291
No.

01:50.333 --> 01:52.708
Come, my child, help me.

01:54.291 --> 01:56.000
He'll be fine.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.166
We just need to get him home.

01:58.916 --> 02:00.958
God will heal Leo.

03:46.750 --> 03:50.458
...you are not just
a customer, you are part of the machine.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.666
If you see acts of graffiti
being committed,

05:22.750 --> 05:25.125
please notify the authorities.

05:25.208 --> 05:30.000
All American military personnel
must have valid passes.

05:30.083 --> 05:31.708
Leo!

05:52.541 --> 05:53.541
Hi!

05:56.375 --> 05:57.666
I'm so sorry.

05:58.416 --> 05:59.500
I'm late.

06:00.916 --> 06:02.000
So sorry.

06:05.041 --> 06:06.125
Yeah, let's go.

06:07.833 --> 06:10.000
Leo, I got something for you.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.458
Well, you have to wait.

06:16.625 --> 06:18.625
Come on. I'm starving.

06:33.166 --> 06:36.541
Please watch your heads.
FlyMeal coming through.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.666
You really don't mind eating this again?

06:41.625 --> 06:42.745
It's comfort food, you know?

06:47.291 --> 06:48.416
Here.

07:02.916 --> 07:05.416
Don't get me wrong.
I really love your very...

07:06.375 --> 07:08.458
peculiar way of living, but...

07:10.416 --> 07:12.500
it would make things
so much easier.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.083
It's the oldest, simplest phone
I could find.

07:24.208 --> 07:26.625
Wow!

07:27.708 --> 07:30.708
So that's where you...
Wait, let me show it to you.

07:33.791 --> 07:37.416
So... Okay,
that's how you turn it on, and...

07:57.416 --> 07:58.416
What?

07:59.416 --> 08:01.916
Leo, stop hiding.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.250
You are so beautiful.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.958
Da stargo tora.

08:07.458 --> 08:09.250
The black of my eyes.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.875
Da stargo tora.

08:13.416 --> 08:15.916
Means "the thing
that makes me feel beautiful."

08:39.707 --> 08:40.916
- Hi!
- Hi.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.333
One more?

09:27.458 --> 09:30.666
That's a real sexy hood ornament
you got dancing up there tonight.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.208
Upstairs.

09:50.625 --> 09:52.125
I need two more of those.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.041
That's my favorite so far.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.291
But it's too easy.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.208
Make me a sea horse.

10:23.041 --> 10:25.625
- Here you are, mate. Here she comes.
- Come on, love.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.791
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

10:27.875 --> 10:28.875
Ladies.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.708
Here, love.
My man's got a question for you.

10:31.791 --> 10:34.625
I'm wondering
if the top matches the bottom.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.291
Isn't he charming?

10:37.375 --> 10:39.458
- Just take that.
- Hey, Naadirah.

10:40.166 --> 10:43.166
- Hey, pretty girl.
- Naadirah, let's go take a break.

10:44.416 --> 10:45.416
Come on.

10:45.541 --> 10:47.125
- She loves it.
- Loves it.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.791
So, did Nicky talk to you?

10:50.375 --> 10:53.000
- Yeah.
- How much money you have saved so far?

10:54.208 --> 10:56.791
- Not enough.
- And why isn't he helping?

10:56.875 --> 11:00.208
He doesn't know.
Luba, get off the car.

11:00.291 --> 11:01.666
What? He doesn't know?

11:01.750 --> 11:05.541
Wow! Mute and dumb. What a catch.

11:05.625 --> 11:09.458
You haven't brought him over.
I hope it's got nothing to do with me.

11:09.541 --> 11:10.416
Luba.

11:10.500 --> 11:14.083
You can put a sock on the door handle
so I know not to come in.

11:14.166 --> 11:17.291
Or wait till I'm asleep.
I know he'll be quiet.

11:17.375 --> 11:18.375
Stop.

11:19.666 --> 11:21.708
Why the hell can't he talk anyway?

11:23.541 --> 11:24.958
It's complicated.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.333
It's his mother's fault.

11:26.416 --> 11:29.916
He needs surgery.
It's against her beliefs.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
If my mom tried to stop me talking,
I would fuck her up.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.603
And she's in a wheelchair.

11:39.041 --> 11:40.458
He doesn't need words.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.333
He's kind.

11:43.416 --> 11:44.708
Why wouldn't I love him?

11:47.041 --> 11:48.041
Love?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.583
I didn't do that?

11:55.791 --> 11:58.458
- Aw, Luba...
- No.

12:00.416 --> 12:04.250
- I'm gonna go back inside.
- Wait, wait. So who did Nicky suggest?

12:04.333 --> 12:05.333
Oswald.

12:05.916 --> 12:09.083
It doesn't matter how close
you rub up against Grace, Luba,

12:09.750 --> 12:11.833
you will never be as beautiful as her.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.166
- Get off my car.
- Okay.

12:15.666 --> 12:18.291
- Back to work. Let's go.
- Fine.

12:23.458 --> 12:26.458
Blue is my favorite lollipop color.
I just lick 'em like...

12:26.541 --> 12:27.875
You know what I think?

12:27.958 --> 12:30.125
Maybe I didn't offer enough money.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.767
- Get your hands off me.
- This goes easier if you don't fight...

12:32.791 --> 12:35.083
- Get your hands off me.
- Who do you think... Hey!

12:35.166 --> 12:37.125
What you doing? Hey! Rob! Rob!

12:39.458 --> 12:41.708
- What you doing? Hey!
- It's all right. Leave him be.

12:42.666 --> 12:44.875
- I didn't know she was your woman.
- Leave him be.

12:44.958 --> 12:46.416
Get your hands off him!

12:47.583 --> 12:49.708
- You all right?
- Yeah, he took my money, man.

12:49.791 --> 12:51.392
- Fucking thief.
- Never put your hands on me.

12:51.416 --> 12:53.250
- This is expensive shit.
- It's not worth it.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.375
Leo. Leo.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.166
Leo!

12:57.583 --> 12:59.541
I can't lose this job.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.041
Yeah, listen to your bitch, Leo.

13:09.416 --> 13:11.208
Yeah, go on.
Keep walking, lanky prick.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.583
Yeah, get out, man.

13:14.625 --> 13:15.625
Fucker.

13:20.208 --> 13:21.375
Hey, don't push me!

13:21.458 --> 13:23.500
Welcome.
Please take your seats

13:23.583 --> 13:25.208
and fasten your seat belts.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.000
Yeah? That's what your mom liked.

13:39.916 --> 13:40.916
Hello?

13:43.208 --> 13:44.208
Oh, yeah.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.291
All right. All right. Getting it.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.541
Thank you.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.875
Hey, lover boy. Let's go.

14:14.583 --> 14:17.208
I built my dream here,
piece by piece.

14:18.541 --> 14:22.375
My car, my club, my security.

14:25.916 --> 14:26.958
Not easy.

14:32.416 --> 14:36.625
If you interfere with what I have made...

14:41.541 --> 14:42.875
One warning.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.416
One.

14:47.541 --> 14:50.208
I don't want to see you in here again.

15:50.708 --> 15:52.333
Something happened tonight.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.958
No. No, I'm not hurt.

15:59.958 --> 16:00.958
But I...

16:05.875 --> 16:07.625
I need to tell you something.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.041
Someone I...

16:12.416 --> 16:14.500
I need to tell you about someone.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.958
But no! No, I'm not leaving you, but I...

16:28.125 --> 16:30.916
I have to tell you something about me.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.708
God, Leo. The last thing
I want to do is leave you.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.333
What are you always doodling in there?

17:50.458 --> 17:51.750
A bed?

17:53.750 --> 17:55.000
A bed for us?

18:11.208 --> 18:12.583
Leo, where are we going?

18:15.541 --> 18:17.333
It's freezing cold.

18:23.166 --> 18:25.000
Leo, do you have a car?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.916
It's like it's from a fairy tale.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.083
I don't deserve you, Leo.

19:43.333 --> 19:44.333
I love you.

19:45.666 --> 19:47.291
I love you so much.

19:48.916 --> 19:50.291
I always will.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.458
But you don't know me.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.833
Maybe if she saw Josie more,
she'd get off your back.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.375
You're down here half the time.

21:07.458 --> 21:08.976
She's my daughter.
She stays with me.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.250
What does Josie want?

21:10.333 --> 21:11.375
Hold on.

21:12.541 --> 21:13.833
I can't see shit.

21:13.916 --> 21:17.000
You know what? We're gonna have to cut
these pants right off.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.333
She's a kid.
She does what she's told.

21:19.416 --> 21:21.000
Her mom can kiss my Yankee ass.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.666
I'm trying to save this leg.

21:24.708 --> 21:27.291
I'll make it up to Josie
when we get back to New York.

21:28.541 --> 21:30.541
Oh, what fun panties.

21:30.625 --> 21:33.916
- Club camo?
- And they work with the garters.

21:35.416 --> 21:37.750
What do you have in here?
Are you throwing this out?

21:37.833 --> 21:39.041
Junk. Leave it.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.458
You know, I can see the shell,

21:41.541 --> 21:42.791
I just can't...

21:42.875 --> 21:44.475
- Yeah, yeah...
- Easy...

21:44.500 --> 21:46.125
I know. It hurts all over.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.750
Put weight on it.

21:51.833 --> 21:55.458
That, my myopic friend, is a .38.

21:55.541 --> 21:58.333
My, my. So it is.
You got eyes like a hawk.

21:58.916 --> 22:01.708
Leave those baby blues to me.
I'll recycle them.

22:04.250 --> 22:05.250
Checkmate.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.695
- Want to chuck some rock later?
- Sure do.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.458
Is good?

22:12.375 --> 22:16.458
- He was shot five times?
- Gunther...

22:20.291 --> 22:22.000
- Da. Five.
- Yeah.

22:22.083 --> 22:24.125
Well, then... is good.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.916
Old slim here's gonna be ready
to rob and roll before you know it.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.250
Go on, close him up.

22:28.916 --> 22:31.291
An honor and a pleasure, my friend.

22:33.375 --> 22:36.541
- Is this guy family or one of your goons?
- Not family.

22:37.083 --> 22:39.166
No. Make the stitches big.

22:41.250 --> 22:45.000
No one in my family
is stupid enough to get shot five times.

22:45.083 --> 22:46.250
Yeah?

22:47.250 --> 22:49.375
Tell him to get
the fuck out of the way the next time,

22:49.458 --> 22:52.750
because I don't plan on sticking around
to help him sort out his social life.

22:52.833 --> 22:54.583
So, you leave soon?

22:56.166 --> 22:58.500
I don't know, Akim. Do I?

22:59.500 --> 23:02.750
Boss says two days. Three at most.

23:02.833 --> 23:04.458
That sounds like an excuse, babe.

23:04.541 --> 23:06.541
It does, right?
I mean, that's an awful lot.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.375
Still, it's gotta be nice, right?

23:08.458 --> 23:11.375
Having a surgeon on call?
All private and such?

23:13.750 --> 23:16.541
Well, that is me. Miller time.

23:18.250 --> 23:22.000
How about you, Akim? Want a little drink?
Black Russian, maybe?

23:22.083 --> 23:26.666
If he say
he get you out of country, he get.

23:26.750 --> 23:28.166
It's delicate.

23:28.250 --> 23:30.750
Maksim has to be careful, yes?

23:30.833 --> 23:33.208
He doesn't want trouble
from military police.

23:33.916 --> 23:36.041
You are a-hole.

23:37.375 --> 23:41.083
AWOL. Yeah.
See, I'm AWOL. You're a-hole.

23:42.666 --> 23:46.541
Expensive to make
American soldier disappear.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.541
Especially now. Lots of work.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.958
But he likes you, Cactus. Relax.
Is not going to be problem.

23:53.041 --> 23:57.291
Oh, goody. 'Cause the sooner I am out of
this shit stain of a country, the better.

23:57.375 --> 23:59.958
If you hate Germany so much,
why are you here?

24:00.833 --> 24:03.875
He joined a fraternity. Wanna-be-a-papa.

24:06.041 --> 24:07.500
Don't be a fuckin' AWOL.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.583
Bag.

24:57.250 --> 25:00.170
We're trying to keep this
as relaxed as possible, Mr. Bell.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.291
You can be seated, you can stand.
It really doesn't matter.

25:03.833 --> 25:09.166
Um... I'll sit. I'll stand.
I mean, I'll sit.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.333
Do something, man.

25:10.416 --> 25:13.833
- My name is Sam Bell.
- So is mine! So is mine, pal!

25:13.916 --> 25:15.583
- Hey, come on!
- Order!

25:15.666 --> 25:16.892
- Come on!
- It's my name too.

25:16.916 --> 25:17.750
- Order!
- Yeah.

25:17.833 --> 25:18.916
Are you strict?

25:20.125 --> 25:21.375
Amish.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.333
You turned away from the TV.

25:28.541 --> 25:29.625
You're a strict one.

25:33.916 --> 25:36.791
We've all got vices, my friend.

25:37.375 --> 25:39.916
- Shut up!
- I understand...

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I watch
too much of this shit anyway.

26:04.958 --> 26:05.958
Hey.

26:07.666 --> 26:08.791
Hey!

26:10.708 --> 26:12.500
What does a guy have to do
to get service?

26:12.583 --> 26:14.083
There's no table service.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.416
Are you serious?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.833
- There's no table service. You order here.
- It's like three fuckin' feet.

26:40.291 --> 26:41.291
Such a...

26:42.375 --> 26:43.958
Man. All right.

26:44.291 --> 26:48.000
Okay. All right. Okay. Okay.
I'm gonna be all right.

26:51.291 --> 26:53.083
I would... Hold on.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.583
Could I get a cappuccino?

27:06.333 --> 27:09.291
Just give me a bonca
fucka-fookin'-fuckin' coffee, would you?

27:14.166 --> 27:15.708
You work at Dreams, right?

27:19.291 --> 27:22.166
I heard you got in a fight
the other night with some limeys.

27:22.416 --> 27:26.750
Now, I'm not the kind of guy
to get between a man and his grudge,

27:26.833 --> 27:29.041
but don't do that again.

27:30.791 --> 27:32.583
I'd really appreciate it.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.333
I need those assholes.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.916
At least for another week.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.666
Hey! Mine's bigger than that.

27:59.041 --> 28:00.333
Did you spit in this?

28:19.625 --> 28:21.666
Hey, dummy. What'd you do with Naadirah?

28:22.791 --> 28:23.791
Where is she?

28:31.833 --> 28:33.166
Leo, this is Nicky.

28:33.875 --> 28:35.791
He runs Maksim's business
across the street.

28:36.875 --> 28:39.583
He drinks free, all right?
What are you having, Nicky?

28:39.875 --> 28:41.291
Two shots, single malt.

28:41.916 --> 28:44.333
Send that and a Stoli up to the office.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.333
Two vodkas
on the rocks, please, mate?

28:58.541 --> 29:00.875
- Chop, chop.
- Come on, boy.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.041
No hard feelings about last night.
These things happen, all right?

29:07.083 --> 29:08.958
Oh yeah, one more thing, mate.

29:09.541 --> 29:12.375
Where's that little blue-haired waitress
from yesterday? Hmm?

29:12.875 --> 29:14.916
'Cause I'd like to give her
an apology as well.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.166
I'd like to give her a very big apology.

29:22.208 --> 29:23.208
Come here!

29:24.333 --> 29:26.125
Hey, stop!

29:32.375 --> 29:34.666
Leo, you're fired.

31:18.875 --> 31:21.250
Cocksucking commie assholes.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.541
It's a good likeness, babe.

31:26.875 --> 31:28.208
You know who drew that?

31:28.291 --> 31:32.083
That fucking barman
who beat up my ticket out of here.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.291
God! This place...

31:34.833 --> 31:36.958
No wonder the Krauts
keep invading other countries.

31:37.916 --> 31:41.541
If I knew I was stuck here
for the rest of time,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.666
I would be blitzkrieging my ass
through France too.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.708
You'll make it back to the States.
It's gonna be great.

31:49.916 --> 31:53.791
Uh-oh... Someone's awake.

31:54.583 --> 31:56.791
Come here.
Say hi to your Uncle Duck.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.708
What are you doing awake? Oh.

32:03.291 --> 32:06.916
Oh, man. What a beautiful babe.
You sure she's yours?

32:07.000 --> 32:08.750
She says she can't sleep.

32:10.708 --> 32:12.958
No? Did you have a nightmare?

32:17.000 --> 32:20.208
- You want some water, honey?
- No, I'm gonna stick with beer.

32:21.125 --> 32:26.666
- Bill, I need to take off.
- Okay. Here, take a cab.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.375
You need any help with her again,
call me.

32:30.458 --> 32:32.750
- Thank you.
- Bye, Josie. See you soon.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.666
Hey, you did great tonight.
Thanks, Kanwal.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.041
Bye.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.625
Bye.

32:43.875 --> 32:46.375
- She work at the club?
- She works at the parlor.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.250
- Oh.
- Sweet kid.

32:49.958 --> 32:52.000
What do you say we take you upstairs?

32:52.708 --> 32:54.875
I'll read you a story.
Come on. I'll tuck you in.

33:05.458 --> 33:07.833
By the way, what happened downstairs...

33:08.541 --> 33:11.250
The little word game, "Wanna-be-a-papa"?

33:11.333 --> 33:14.375
Don't do that again. I'll hurt you.

33:14.458 --> 33:15.958
I was just playing, babe.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.250
Hmm. And don't shtup our babysitter.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.208
That'd be weird, right?

33:53.791 --> 33:56.250
Volkea Reward credits
are still available

33:56.333 --> 34:00.041
for customers reporting the whereabouts
of US service personnel

34:00.125 --> 34:01.875
absent without leave.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.500
Don't be shy. Screw that guy.

34:55.666 --> 34:57.466
What do you want?

34:59.458 --> 35:00.875
What do you want?

35:07.958 --> 35:09.333
Don't know her.

35:09.583 --> 35:11.333
You've got the wrong place.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.375
Follow me, love.

36:15.875 --> 36:16.750
You?

36:16.833 --> 36:18.513
Get out.
You're going to get me in trouble.

36:24.791 --> 36:29.458
If you haven't found her, it's probably
because she's finally dumped you,

36:29.541 --> 36:31.000
you useless shit.

36:34.916 --> 36:35.916
Or...

36:37.333 --> 36:38.333
or...

36:40.666 --> 36:43.875
maybe you're here for me.

36:47.833 --> 36:50.208
Yeah. That's right.

36:51.583 --> 36:56.166
Oh, what? What? Are you judging me now?
You fucking tech-tard!

36:56.625 --> 36:59.375
- Hey, Luba!
- Do you think your girlfriend's a saint?

36:59.458 --> 37:01.298
You think your girlfriend's a saint,
don't you?

37:01.375 --> 37:06.375
Trust me. Trust me. Naadirah has secrets.

37:10.166 --> 37:12.166
You all right, Luba?

37:12.250 --> 37:15.083
I touch his dick
and he jumps like a spooked dog.

37:17.291 --> 37:18.291
Gunther.

37:19.291 --> 37:20.500
Let me help you.

37:51.458 --> 37:53.375
Da stargo tora.

37:54.250 --> 37:55.958
Da stargo tora.

37:57.125 --> 37:58.666
Da stargo tora.

38:17.041 --> 38:19.083
All these people are here for IDs?

38:19.166 --> 38:22.875
No, mate. The whole thing's organic.
Different crews in on different days.

38:22.958 --> 38:26.708
You know, chop shops, data miners,
arms dealers, cybernetics.

38:27.458 --> 38:30.416
If you want it, someone in here
can supply it. Probably me.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.083
The cops don't shut you down?

38:32.166 --> 38:35.458
Nah, we migrate.
Try not to overstay our welcome, you know?

38:39.125 --> 38:40.583
I do not believe this shit.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.958
Rob! Rob! That motherfucker...

38:49.416 --> 38:51.875
Hey! Jesus.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.125
Come on.

39:11.125 --> 39:14.833
Oi! No trouble from you, son.
Not today.

39:16.041 --> 39:17.875
You lost, mate? Hmm?

39:21.208 --> 39:22.666
I'm not interested in her, Leo.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.101
We saw enough of her at the club.
Didn't we?

39:24.125 --> 39:25.208
Yeah, we did.

39:25.541 --> 39:26.541
Ah!

39:30.166 --> 39:32.000
Take a hint and fuck off.

39:34.625 --> 39:35.666
You heard the man.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.541
Now look, I'm not trying to be
disrespectful. Am I, Rob?

39:38.625 --> 39:39.958
No, you're not stupid.

39:41.291 --> 39:44.750
What's a class bird like
your missus doing with a Joey like you?

39:46.541 --> 39:51.500
I mean, look at you.
Mute, broke, bullshit fashion sense.

40:24.875 --> 40:27.291
Hey, are you even listening to me?

40:29.916 --> 40:31.375
Fuck me, he's weird.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.833
Oh!

41:04.916 --> 41:08.166
Oh, the duck flies. Oh, he flies.

41:08.250 --> 41:11.583
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sit down.
- Yeah, ball's loaded, babe.

41:12.666 --> 41:13.666
Yeah.

41:14.041 --> 41:16.291
So, you and Josie all plugged
into the system now?

41:16.375 --> 41:17.458
I think so.

41:19.583 --> 41:21.875
- You know that bartender from the club?
- Yeah.

41:23.083 --> 41:24.666
He crashed the session.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.250
- Are you serious?
- I got Josie out of there.

41:27.333 --> 41:28.500
Something's going on.

41:28.583 --> 41:30.416
I don't know why you
don't use my passport.

41:31.083 --> 41:32.791
You know, do your fingertips,

41:32.875 --> 41:34.916
retina implant,
you gotta bleach your hair,

41:35.000 --> 41:36.958
and then you gotta shave
the lady tickler off.

41:37.041 --> 41:38.333
I'd rather kill myself.

41:39.666 --> 41:42.291
I understand.
It's hard to be this good-looking.

41:43.375 --> 41:44.791
It's a responsibility.

41:44.875 --> 41:45.916
Yeah, that's it.

41:48.541 --> 41:50.822
Are you gonna stick around here
for the rest of your life?

41:51.250 --> 41:54.875
Why not? Plenty of work, good perks.

41:54.958 --> 41:56.958
Make better implants than anybody else.

41:57.375 --> 41:58.833
I don't mind being the big fish.

42:00.083 --> 42:03.166
Besides, my life's a lot less complicated
than yours, babe.

42:04.291 --> 42:05.833
As long as I've got enough to eat,

42:06.833 --> 42:09.750
some cash to splash,
and some cooch to smooch...

42:09.833 --> 42:11.458
I am...

42:14.666 --> 42:16.333
Ooh! ...a happy man.

42:17.375 --> 42:18.541
I should turn pro.

42:21.416 --> 42:22.583
Oh.

42:22.666 --> 42:23.916
Oh, look at that.

42:25.083 --> 42:26.291
School girls, babe.

42:27.625 --> 42:29.958
Itty-bitty titties
and smooth little pussies.

42:30.833 --> 42:31.833
Wow.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.000
- Then they grow up.
- Take your fucking shot.

42:35.083 --> 42:36.166
I'll tell you something,

42:36.250 --> 42:38.041
it's not gonna be long
before you're fighting

42:38.125 --> 42:41.416
all them young studs off that
cutie-pie little daughter of yours.

42:41.500 --> 42:42.375
Ow! Fuck!

42:42.458 --> 42:45.291
Don't do that.
Don't talk about my daughter.

42:46.916 --> 42:48.041
Get off me, man.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.375
Just fucking playing around, man.

42:51.458 --> 42:53.958
You need to maintain
a sense of humor, babe.

42:55.625 --> 42:57.625
Ah, fuck!

42:58.208 --> 43:01.541
Why don't you just build yourself
a new hand, big fish?

43:05.583 --> 43:06.750
Let me see it.

43:07.916 --> 43:09.166
Come on, let me see it.

43:13.291 --> 43:14.666
Hold this against it.

43:15.791 --> 43:17.416
All right, I'll take your shot.

43:37.916 --> 43:40.791
So close.

43:42.791 --> 43:45.000
This is Oswald.
I'm busy.

43:45.083 --> 43:47.000
Please leave packages downstairs.

43:58.208 --> 43:59.250
Who the hell are you?

44:02.000 --> 44:03.666
Hey! Hey!

44:04.833 --> 44:07.416
You can't come barging
into a man's home uninvited.

44:08.375 --> 44:09.791
I could be entertaining.

44:10.916 --> 44:12.208
This is my place.

44:12.291 --> 44:13.291
What's your name?

44:16.958 --> 44:19.041
That's... that's none of your business.

44:20.750 --> 44:22.541
Don't worry about that.

44:23.875 --> 44:26.708
Oi! Dickhead, that's private!

44:29.375 --> 44:30.458
You speak English?

44:31.791 --> 44:33.125
You speak Deutsch?

44:36.041 --> 44:37.041
Oh, shit.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Deutsch.

44:42.958 --> 44:45.041
- Oh...
- Ah...

44:46.208 --> 44:49.666
You work for Nicky Simsek?

44:50.500 --> 44:53.000
This is ridiculous.

44:53.083 --> 44:55.916
Wait there. Hold on.

45:04.500 --> 45:07.250
If Nicky wants to keep
this little sideline of his running,

45:07.333 --> 45:09.375
he needs to get a better class of whore.

45:09.666 --> 45:12.041
Fat Max wasn't even that fat.

45:12.125 --> 45:15.541
And he should shower next time,
between clients.

45:18.791 --> 45:20.041
You're here for Naadirah.

45:21.750 --> 45:23.000
I already paid her.

45:23.666 --> 45:26.250
If Nicky didn't get his money,
his problem is with her, not me.

45:27.500 --> 45:28.875
But you can tell Nicky,

45:29.583 --> 45:33.000
if he wants to do business with me,
he can do it in person,

45:33.750 --> 45:35.390
not through that thieving whore Naadirah.

45:37.916 --> 45:40.250
Okay. Okay. All right.
You wanna earn a bit?

45:40.333 --> 45:41.583
Yeah, we can go on the bed.

46:06.708 --> 46:10.125
You tell Nicky, you can come next time!

46:23.833 --> 46:27.041
If Nicky didn't get his money,
then his problem's with her, not me.

46:27.125 --> 46:28.041
This is Nicky.

46:28.125 --> 46:30.291
He runs Maksim's business
across the street.

46:31.333 --> 46:33.250
Da stargo tora.

46:34.166 --> 46:36.083
Da stargo tora.

46:36.708 --> 46:38.458
Da stargo tora.

46:44.750 --> 46:46.375
How old are you, sweetheart?

46:46.458 --> 46:47.875
How old do you think I am?

46:49.375 --> 46:54.416
I don't know. My eyes might be playing
tricks on me, but I say 17, maybe?

46:54.500 --> 46:57.458
- You don't think I could be 16?
- Oh?

46:57.541 --> 46:59.708
Kanwal, we don't need
that kind of trouble.

47:01.166 --> 47:03.208
- I'm 21.
- Twenty-two next week.

47:03.291 --> 47:06.166
Why are you fucking this up for me?
You hate money or something?

47:07.375 --> 47:09.791
Kanwal, how would you like
to make me feel 16 again?

47:13.541 --> 47:14.541
Move your butt here.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.083
- Are you really a doctor?
- Yes, I am.

47:18.750 --> 47:19.833
Don't look at me like that.

47:20.833 --> 47:21.833
Carpe culus.

47:23.875 --> 47:24.750
Is Tanya around?

47:24.833 --> 47:26.916
I thought Kanwal was watching Josie.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.416
Yeah, well, Prince Charming there
just stole my babysitter.

47:30.500 --> 47:31.583
Tanya!

47:37.375 --> 47:38.250
Hey, Cactus.

47:38.333 --> 47:41.375
Hey. Can you do me a favor?
Watch Josie for a while?

47:41.458 --> 47:42.458
Sure.

47:42.708 --> 47:45.250
How are you, sweetie? That looks nice.

47:45.333 --> 47:46.791
Need a babysitter again, Bill?

47:46.875 --> 47:48.083
'Course. It'll be fun.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.886
What the fuck's
on your face, Luba?

47:51.416 --> 47:52.833
You want some dinner, angel?

47:53.541 --> 47:55.041
Daddy's gotta go. Oh!

47:56.083 --> 47:57.083
No soda.

48:09.833 --> 48:11.833
Hey, Bill.

48:15.208 --> 48:16.375
Sergeant.

48:18.416 --> 48:21.958
You know, I've always wondered
what goes on in this place.

48:23.041 --> 48:27.166
I see a lot of guys going in tense
and coming out smiling.

48:27.250 --> 48:30.291
Not everyone enjoys their job
as much as you, Robert.

48:30.916 --> 48:32.833
Some of us need help to relax.

48:34.708 --> 48:36.125
Not so much you, though.

48:37.833 --> 48:39.125
You're always tense.

48:40.416 --> 48:43.958
Think I might
like to check it out sometime.

48:44.916 --> 48:47.416
- Have a look around.
- Any red-blooded male should.

48:48.041 --> 48:51.083
Thing is, Uncle Sam's
a cheap son of a bitch

48:51.166 --> 48:54.000
and I gotta send most of my money
back home to Sally and the kids.

48:54.083 --> 48:55.333
You know the drill.

48:56.708 --> 48:58.083
Well, hell, Robert,

48:58.625 --> 49:01.750
let me have a word with the ladies inside
and get you fixed up.

49:01.833 --> 49:04.291
Hey, you do like the ladies?

49:04.375 --> 49:07.458
Oh, I'm a straight shooter, Bill.
You can bank on that.

49:10.500 --> 49:11.708
You're a brother.

49:13.416 --> 49:15.541
And being as we're bros,

49:15.625 --> 49:19.125
I think it's only fair I tell you
that somebody out there

49:19.208 --> 49:22.083
is sure keen to see you
get picked up by us.

49:22.541 --> 49:23.833
Your ex-wife.

49:25.916 --> 49:26.916
Yeah.

49:27.666 --> 49:29.875
Willing to pay real money.

49:31.250 --> 49:32.875
Good thing we're so close, then, huh?

49:36.708 --> 49:38.416
Take it easy, Cactus.

50:24.583 --> 50:28.125
Hey!
Tell Maksim his car is ready.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.416
Halt! Halt!

52:27.791 --> 52:29.101
I've been to America.

52:29.125 --> 52:31.625
I didn't like it,
but many of you do, so...

52:34.708 --> 52:35.788
Can I help you?

52:37.791 --> 52:39.416
Don't worry, he'll move on.

52:48.125 --> 52:49.205
How freaky is that?

52:50.083 --> 52:53.208
We have a beachside restaurant
on the fifth floor.

52:54.500 --> 52:57.541
Hey! What is this?
Fucking art class? Hmm?

53:04.041 --> 53:06.791
- What the fuck...
- Nicky, language.

53:06.875 --> 53:08.375
Okay, take the kid out of here.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.833
- I'm still hungry.
- Please, Makiko,

53:10.916 --> 53:13.375
- take the kid out of here.
- Come on. Let's go.

53:36.125 --> 53:38.000
See that syndicate over there?

53:38.083 --> 53:40.916
They work with my boss,
so all I got to do is call them over

53:41.000 --> 53:44.291
and they'll cook your nutsack faster
than this fine piece of fillet.

53:44.375 --> 53:45.375
Do you understand?

53:49.208 --> 53:50.833
Doesn't work for me.

53:51.833 --> 53:53.708
You're a bit of a perv, aren't you?

53:54.708 --> 53:56.958
I'm sure we can find someone
at the massage parlor

53:57.041 --> 53:58.541
to cater to your kink.

54:00.875 --> 54:02.791
I said, she doesn't work for me.

54:05.750 --> 54:07.208
Wait. I know you.

54:07.666 --> 54:09.226
I know you.
You're the barman.

54:09.250 --> 54:12.416
Dude, I wouldn't tell your crazy ass
anything if my life depended on it.

54:12.500 --> 54:14.083
Who the fuck is this?

54:14.166 --> 54:16.086
What are you doing
searching for all these girls?

54:16.958 --> 54:19.416
Are they related to you?
Are you stalking them?

54:19.500 --> 54:21.708
I think you need to leave. Now.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.458
Come on, guys.

54:25.541 --> 54:29.666
Would you escort this bartender
back to his bottles?

54:29.750 --> 54:31.625
They must be getting lonely by now.

54:56.875 --> 54:58.791
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

56:21.791 --> 56:23.333
What did you have in mind?

56:25.125 --> 56:26.500
Yeah, we could do that.

56:28.041 --> 56:30.333
Yeah.

56:31.041 --> 56:32.041
Yeah.

56:32.208 --> 56:34.458
I know. I know. I know. I know.
Yeah, I gotta go.

56:36.208 --> 56:37.208
What the...

56:38.958 --> 56:41.041
I'm so... I'm sorry.
Who is this gorgeous girl?

56:41.875 --> 56:45.125
I seem to remember
a really sad little girl coming in here.

56:45.208 --> 56:46.750
A sad girl with one leg, but...

56:47.500 --> 56:49.125
Are you sure it's the same girl?

56:49.916 --> 56:52.625
Um... play Wayne.

56:59.250 --> 57:02.500
Fit's perfect.
I just wanna record her gait for analysis.

57:02.583 --> 57:03.583
Of course.

57:05.791 --> 57:08.083
Take a look. Beautiful.

57:13.166 --> 57:14.541
You are moving on that thing.

57:17.500 --> 57:21.166
You're a pro. Here.
We'll get you up on this treadmill

57:21.250 --> 57:24.666
and Uncle Duck is gonna record
this beautiful moment forever.

57:24.750 --> 57:27.291
Careful now. Keep your back straight.

57:27.375 --> 57:30.083
- Thank you so much, Dr. Teddington.
- Please. My pleasure.

57:42.250 --> 57:44.125
A nice straight back for me.

57:44.416 --> 57:45.541
There you go.

57:47.166 --> 57:48.333
Just walk normally.

57:51.833 --> 57:53.291
That's it.

57:54.041 --> 57:56.333
That's it. Yes.

57:58.083 --> 57:59.208
Yes, indeed.

58:55.375 --> 58:57.455
Yes,
I would like to order something.

58:57.791 --> 59:00.000
Make it the pork with sauerkraut

59:00.083 --> 59:01.166
and a beer.

59:02.083 --> 59:05.791
No, track my phone. I'm out and about.

59:18.791 --> 59:20.434
Welcome to Dig-Ins.

59:20.458 --> 59:22.250
What can I do for you tonight?

59:26.208 --> 59:29.333
Great. I just need you
to tell me your phone number.

59:33.208 --> 59:35.166
I forget my phone number too.

59:37.208 --> 59:40.500
I need my mental power for chick digits.

59:49.583 --> 59:51.726
Please tell me your phone number.

59:51.750 --> 59:53.710
You have to
speak your number into it.

59:56.833 --> 59:58.750
You have to speak your number into it.

01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:04.000
That's messed up.

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:05.500
You can't talk at all?

01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:09.875
Okay.

01:00:10.958 --> 01:00:11.958
Let's see.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:16.333
72 32 89 11

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:20.166
60 44 67.

01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:23.309
You can't send food to this number.

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:26.583
Please enable
tracking for this phone number.

01:00:29.291 --> 01:00:32.333
You can wait here
or have it droned to your apartment.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.166
Do you want a drink?

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:24.250
What did you do to Nicky?

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:27.000
He said he needed to find Naadirah.

01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:30.250
I've never seen him so scared.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:32.250
And...

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.333
I mean, you did that.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.250
It's... it's pretty impressive.

01:01:40.875 --> 01:01:46.125
I thought you and Naadirah were trying
to pull some disappearing act

01:01:46.208 --> 01:01:47.916
to get away from me.

01:01:52.416 --> 01:01:54.041
You really are looking for her.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Aren't you?

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:13.083
What, you like these?

01:02:13.833 --> 01:02:16.250
Don't worry, they come off.
You can borrow them.

01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:29.083
Yeah.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:31.875
Yeah.

01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:34.833
Love is fucking crazy, man.

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:42.041
She needed money,
and I told her I would get it because...

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.541
I hate myself enough to do that for her.

01:02:45.625 --> 01:02:46.625
Would you?

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:51.791
Do you really love her that much?
Would you do anything for her?

01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:54.375
Anything?

01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:01.291
If she's not with me,

01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:04.791
why would she be with you?
What are you?

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.083
You're nothing.

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:09.958
She's gone.

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:13.541
She took the money that I made for her

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:15.083
and she left!

01:03:19.333 --> 01:03:20.333
And now...

01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:27.083
Now Maksim knows what I did.

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:32.166
Fuck, I need to get out of here.

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:36.666
Do you want help in finding Naadirah?

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:43.208
I know you're not that big on technology,
but do you know what this is?

01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:51.958
I shouldn't be here.

01:03:52.041 --> 01:03:53.833
I need to tell you something.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:04:00.333
There's something you need
to know about me.

01:04:00.416 --> 01:04:01.708
I shouldn't be here.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.291
I'm leaving you.

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:06.416
I shouldn't be here!

01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:13.333
I need to call you, you know?
I need to be able to reach you.

01:04:15.791 --> 01:04:16.666
Naadirah.

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:19.750
Here's your FlyMeal. Bon appétit!

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:50.750
Da stargo tora.

01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:53.291
Da stargo tora.

01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:55.666
Da stargo tora.

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:06.041
Naadirah.
Naadirah!

01:05:06.125 --> 01:05:09.583
Naadirah! Naadirah? Naadirah?

01:05:38.708 --> 01:05:40.625
Please quietly state

01:05:40.708 --> 01:05:43.041
the name of the publication
you're looking for.

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:33.250
Just take my coat...

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:36.250
Here. Let me move that for you.

01:06:36.833 --> 01:06:40.375
Oh, you're an American, are you? Lovely.

01:06:40.916 --> 01:06:41.916
Now...

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.250
glasses, purse...

01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:47.916
Would you be a dear
and watch my things for a minute

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.958
while I go and get my biscuit?

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.958
It's called a fucking cookie!

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:54.458
Oh! Hello.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.030
Did you bring your mom with you?

01:06:58.083 --> 01:06:59.791
No, that's the new girl at the parlor.

01:06:59.875 --> 01:07:01.875
I thought she'd make
a nice change of pace for you.

01:07:03.083 --> 01:07:04.208
Is that for me?

01:07:05.083 --> 01:07:06.458
Maksim called.

01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:08.083
What's he want?

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:12.000
He wants us to put the squeeze
on Nicky Simsek.

01:07:15.041 --> 01:07:16.166
Nicky?

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:17.767
That's heavy. He's a bad boy.

01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:19.583
But I thought he was team Maksim.
What gives?

01:07:20.541 --> 01:07:23.416
Asshole wants to find out
what Nicky's been doing behind his back.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.833
And you watch. I'm not gonna make
a goddamn mark from this thing.

01:07:29.166 --> 01:07:30.208
What did Nicky do?

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:32.500
Oh... The fuck knows.

01:07:33.208 --> 01:07:34.208
I...

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.416
Besides, Maksim's being
all rapey about it.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.375
"Do this to his ass.
Do this to his ass. Do that..."

01:07:39.458 --> 01:07:40.583
When did torture get so gay?

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:44.875
Jesus. You know, I've had training.
Years have gone into these hands.

01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:48.333
Now, I'm wasting it
on this Spanish Inquisition bullshit.

01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:53.958
That mute bartender was with Nicky.

01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:56.583
They were probably just making
very small talk.

01:07:56.666 --> 01:07:58.958
That's funny.

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:01.708
You know, I think that freak
is looking for Naadi.

01:08:01.958 --> 01:08:03.250
Good luck with that.

01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:05.625
What do you mean?

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.083
Nothing. Just...

01:08:09.833 --> 01:08:12.458
I hope he finds her,
so everyone can mellow the fuck out.

01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:14.416
- What do you wanna do about Nicky?
- Well...

01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:18.666
I say, we just slice the guy
a new fucking Jap's eye

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.017
and see what the son of a bitch
has to say.

01:08:20.041 --> 01:08:23.332
Hold on just a second. Lady,
why don't you stare at your fucking tea,

01:08:23.416 --> 01:08:25.832
because the next time
you give me that stink eye,

01:08:25.916 --> 01:08:28.457
I'm gonna take that cup
and ram it so far up your snatch,

01:08:28.541 --> 01:08:30.166
it'll look like you grew a third ear.

01:08:31.457 --> 01:08:32.791
That way.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:36.166
Jesus. People are so fucking rude.

01:08:41.541 --> 01:08:43.791
You sure you want our help with this?

01:08:43.875 --> 01:08:47.082
You seem to be doing a fine job
beating the shit out of him without us.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.457
- You want him on the table, babe?
- Yeah. Put a sheet on it first.

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.125
Thank you very much.

01:08:54.707 --> 01:08:55.707
Cactus!

01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:56.791
How are you?

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.250
Maksim. Where are my fucking IDs?

01:09:00.332 --> 01:09:01.332
Tomorrow.

01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:05.332
What is it? German Valentine's Day?

01:09:05.416 --> 01:09:08.000
For your daughter.
It's Trippies Sugar Bombs.

01:09:08.082 --> 01:09:10.000
Come on. I know how much you miss home.

01:09:10.082 --> 01:09:11.082
Trippies!

01:09:11.957 --> 01:09:14.375
I feel bad.
I didn't bring anything for you.

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:19.707
So, this is where you work?

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:21.457
Not much, but it's home.

01:09:22.916 --> 01:09:25.041
- Who's this?
- This is Duck.

01:09:25.125 --> 01:09:26.250
We used to sleep together.

01:09:27.082 --> 01:09:28.832
Don't give him
the wrong impression.

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:32.707
We were in Kabul together.
Did a tour of duty. Shared a bunk.

01:09:32.791 --> 01:09:34.332
Where we touched penises.

01:09:34.916 --> 01:09:38.791
- Duck, how are you, my friend?
- Nice to finally meet you.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:41.832
- Do you need papers too?
- Oh, no. No, sir.

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:44.582
No, I served all my time.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.207
How are you?

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:50.707
This fucking mother-sucker...

01:09:51.666 --> 01:09:56.000
Nicky has been sending girls out
on personal business.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:10:00.458
I want to know what the deal is
Nicky has with this crazy bartender.

01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:03.833
This kind of thing hurts my reputation.

01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:09.291
You know what, Maksim?
I don't care how many discos you own,

01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:11.791
- you're still a dirty communist to me.
- Hey!

01:10:15.625 --> 01:10:17.125
You are a bitter man, Bill.

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:21.833
Like the world owes you
something so much better.

01:10:22.583 --> 01:10:24.125
But you live pretty good life.

01:10:25.416 --> 01:10:30.666
You have a beautiful daughter,
a nice house, women, friends.

01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:35.000
I pay you good money.

01:10:38.541 --> 01:10:40.750
You are living the dream. Trust me.

01:10:44.916 --> 01:10:47.000
Be a little more courteous, Cactus.

01:10:49.458 --> 01:10:51.083
I make your life possible.

01:10:51.833 --> 01:10:53.625
Don't take it personally, boss.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:56.041
Cactus has been a dick
to everybody lately.

01:11:06.166 --> 01:11:07.500
Then take it out on this asshole.

01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:14.541
Duck, do whatever you have to.

01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:17.208
Whatever Nicky says,
record and give to Gunther.

01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:18.291
He'll stay with you.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.375
It's your money.

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:25.666
And, Maksim,
I want those fucking IDs in the system.

01:11:26.166 --> 01:11:29.333
Passports,
new birth certificate for Josie.

01:11:29.416 --> 01:11:31.791
Certified data in the fucking net.

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:34.250
No problem. No problem.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.750
"No problem."

01:11:41.416 --> 01:11:42.541
"No problem."

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.458
"No problem."

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:49.208
Think I'm giving that poison to Josie?

01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:52.375
They're called Sugar Bombs,
for fuck's sake.

01:11:53.166 --> 01:11:54.166
What an asshole.

01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:58.125
This is all
just about finding Naadirah.

01:11:58.208 --> 01:12:00.166
We know why the Mouth
was hassling this guy.

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.875
He's not gonna tell us anything new.

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:05.333
Maksim needs to hear
what he needs to hear.

01:12:05.416 --> 01:12:08.541
He's got some cockamamie story
in his head? Let's give him just that.

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:12.000
Well, that's kinda harsh on slick here,
you know?

01:12:12.666 --> 01:12:14.791
Maybe give him a shot. Take the edge off?

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:17.708
No.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.000
Not with the book club over there.
It's gotta sound real.

01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:25.583
Well...

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.333
- I haven't done anything.
- It's been a blast, Nicky.

01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:33.708
You are one unlucky son of a bitch.

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:37.041
My daddy always did say,
"Girls are nothing but trouble."

01:13:33.791 --> 01:13:34.875
Ducky boy!

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.333
Hey, Duck, where you at?

01:14:46.375 --> 01:14:47.500
Hey.

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:49.333
When did you get here?

01:14:50.125 --> 01:14:51.583
"Itty-bitty titties," huh?

01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:54.500
Jesus Christ. Are you high?

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:56.750
Stay the fuck away from my daughter.

01:14:57.708 --> 01:14:59.000
Don't talk to her.

01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:01.625
Don't touch her. Don't even look at her.

01:15:01.708 --> 01:15:04.625
As far as you're concerned,
she doesn't exist. Got it?

01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:05.708
What the fuck, Bill?

01:15:08.125 --> 01:15:10.750
I know what you are,
you sick son of a bitch.

01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:14.000
And I got a good idea
what was going on in Kabul too.

01:15:14.083 --> 01:15:18.125
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I saw your cameras.

01:15:22.166 --> 01:15:24.000
Oh, come on, man.

01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:29.250
The fucking cameras are for patients.
I use them for work.

01:15:30.541 --> 01:15:32.166
How long has it been going on?

01:15:33.166 --> 01:15:34.250
I...

01:15:34.625 --> 01:15:36.291
I just installed them.

01:15:37.541 --> 01:15:39.000
I haven't even recorded anybody.

01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:46.458
Don't lie to me.
I just saw a little girl...

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:47.583
Ow!

01:15:47.666 --> 01:15:50.708
...naked on your screen.
You gonna lie to me now?

01:15:52.041 --> 01:15:55.916
I... I was... I was just messing around.

01:15:56.666 --> 01:15:57.958
Like, as a game...

01:15:58.875 --> 01:16:00.750
"A game"? No.

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:04.583
Basketball's a game.
Tiddlywinks is a game.

01:16:04.666 --> 01:16:07.375
Bowling is a fucking game, Donald!

01:16:07.958 --> 01:16:09.958
- Well...
- This is gonna stop, right now.

01:16:10.041 --> 01:16:12.101
The minute you're thinking,
while you're thinking of something?

01:16:12.125 --> 01:16:13.125
You're thinking of it.

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:16.000
But the second you do something,
that is a world of pain, my friend.

01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:17.083
I know. I...

01:16:17.166 --> 01:16:21.291
No, you don't. Clearly, you don't know.

01:16:23.541 --> 01:16:26.833
Here's what's gonna happen.
You are done treating kids.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:29.708
There are plenty of other doctors
that can do it.

01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:33.333
No child is going to step foot
in this fucking room ever again.

01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:34.416
Okay.

01:16:35.041 --> 01:16:36.375
You wanna know what else?

01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:38.791
Now I know.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.458
What does that mean?

01:16:44.541 --> 01:16:46.500
Means it ain't a secret anymore.

01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:49.208
The second that you do something,

01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:54.250
or the second that I think that you're
even thinking about doing something,

01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:57.208
I am going to break your fucking arms.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.458
From your shoulders
all the way down to your fingernails.

01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:04.541
- Jesus, Bill.
- Got it?

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:06.000
What the...

01:17:06.083 --> 01:17:07.416
- Got it?
- Yes, I...

01:17:08.083 --> 01:17:10.541
- Got it?
- Yes. I... I... Yes.

01:17:11.791 --> 01:17:14.916
I will. I will try.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:18.291
Fuck.

01:17:18.958 --> 01:17:20.833
Don't. I'll do it.

01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:24.333
I'll stop. I promise. I promise I'll stop.

01:17:25.666 --> 01:17:26.541
I promise.

01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:29.166
And I'm sorry.

01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:33.416
I'm sorry.

01:17:34.291 --> 01:17:35.291
Come here.

01:17:35.916 --> 01:17:37.875
Fuck. I love you, brother.

01:17:39.041 --> 01:17:40.708
All right? I won't let anything happen.

01:17:40.791 --> 01:17:41.833
Yeah.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.875
Talk to me, Maksim.

01:17:54.208 --> 01:17:55.458
Mmm-hmm.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.625
Yeah.

01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:02.583
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:18:03.916 --> 01:18:04.916
Huh?

01:18:05.791 --> 01:18:07.625
Tell me when and I'll pick 'em up.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.250
All right.

01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:11.958
Yeah, thanks, Maksim. Thank you.

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:19.250
I got my papers.

01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:23.583
Josie's, mine.

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:24.791
Everything.

01:18:24.875 --> 01:18:26.708
Well, that's great.

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:28.833
Yeah.

01:18:29.666 --> 01:18:30.666
It's great.

01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:36.791
We're gonna celebrate.

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:41.375
Grab your shit. We're going to the mall.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.166
Fuck you!

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
DOCTOR ON CALL

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:03.375
Oh, my God! I'm so homesick.

01:19:03.458 --> 01:19:05.333
Oh, I'm gonna have a burger, baby.

01:19:05.416 --> 01:19:08.500
A real fucking hamburger
with real fucking red meat.

01:20:03.916 --> 01:20:07.250
Stop hiding.
You are so beautiful.

01:20:07.333 --> 01:20:09.875
Leo?

01:20:10.916 --> 01:20:12.166
Leo.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Leo.

01:20:27.791 --> 01:20:31.458
Leo, Naadirah. Leo, Naadirah.

01:21:04.875 --> 01:21:07.041
There's someone I need to tell you about.

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:19.916
Cactus. Cactus.

01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:26.875
Cactus. Cactus.

01:21:59.375 --> 01:22:01.166
Leo, where are we going?

01:22:03.791 --> 01:22:05.125
It's freezing cold.

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:54.291
Judy, Judy, Judy! More beer!

01:23:54.708 --> 01:23:55.875
I got 'em.

01:23:56.458 --> 01:23:57.500
Stand down, Judy.

01:24:03.458 --> 01:24:04.625
There you go, darling.

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:06.625
Thank you.

01:24:13.583 --> 01:24:14.750
I got a plan.

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:16.666
Lay it on me.

01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:18.125
I wanna give you the house.

01:24:19.416 --> 01:24:20.458
Cactus, no.

01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:22.291
The house, man. It's yours.

01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:23.208
Cactus...

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.250
It's perfect. Look...

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:29.041
Get rid of the surgery.
Get rid of that whole kids cyberwear deal.

01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:30.541
Ah, yeah, all right.

01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:32.416
Give yourself a little perspective
on things.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.916
- Hey, I have to make money, babe.
- Exactly, from Maksim.

01:24:36.416 --> 01:24:40.208
- That fucking Russian prick? No way.
- He needs a surgeon and I'm gone.

01:24:40.291 --> 01:24:42.458
He's met you.
He knows that I trust you.

01:24:42.541 --> 01:24:44.875
Come on, man.
It's pulling rounds and sewing tears.

01:24:44.958 --> 01:24:46.916
- You could do it in your sleep.
- I don't know.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.625
You'll be doing the same amount of work,
but getting paid double.

01:24:49.708 --> 01:24:52.958
Look, you sell the clinic?
You got it made in the shade, buddy.

01:24:54.541 --> 01:24:56.291
I can't believe you're really going, babe.

01:24:58.333 --> 01:24:59.458
End of an era.

01:24:59.541 --> 01:25:00.541
Fuckin' A.

01:25:01.416 --> 01:25:02.750
To you, my friend.

01:25:06.208 --> 01:25:07.958
You, sir, I love.

01:25:11.875 --> 01:25:13.666
- The band in the sand.
- Band in the sand.

01:25:21.708 --> 01:25:22.750
Fuck it.

01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:26.000
Let's get laid.

01:25:27.666 --> 01:25:28.666
My treat.

01:25:31.583 --> 01:25:34.875
We gotta stop and get Josie first.
Kanwal wants to take off early.

01:25:34.958 --> 01:25:35.958
Uh-huh.

01:25:36.833 --> 01:25:37.833
Hey, Cactus...

01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:40.791
I wanna thank you for everything.

01:25:40.875 --> 01:25:42.958
Oh, shut up. Have a peanut.

01:25:43.041 --> 01:25:44.083
No, hey...

01:25:46.416 --> 01:25:47.416
Thank you.

01:25:47.916 --> 01:25:49.625
I'm serious, man. Thank you.

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:53.250
Gonna miss you.

01:25:56.583 --> 01:25:58.208
I'm gonna miss you too, babe.

01:26:00.666 --> 01:26:03.416
Hey, I'm sorry
I've been such a dick lately.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.916
I've had a lot on my mind.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.750
Hey, listen.

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.083
I gotta tell you something too.

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:12.250
I'm kind of fucking
with that mute bartender.

01:26:13.083 --> 01:26:14.083
Leo.

01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:17.208
Just, you know, like, on the phone.

01:26:17.291 --> 01:26:19.291
Why would you do that?

01:26:19.375 --> 01:26:21.708
Like you said,
you were kind of being a dick.

01:26:22.458 --> 01:26:24.041
He could've fucked everything up.

01:26:24.666 --> 01:26:25.833
Hey, relax.

01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:27.916
He's a goof.

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:29.708
Asshole.

01:26:29.791 --> 01:26:32.833
Hey! Hey! Excuse me, please.

01:26:34.291 --> 01:26:36.125
Who is this?

01:26:36.708 --> 01:26:38.250
She's a jealous little Nazi.

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:44.750
Hey, hey, stop!

01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:48.583
You're just not our type, okay?
God, what is wrong with her?

01:26:48.666 --> 01:26:49.875
Penis envy.

01:26:49.958 --> 01:26:51.583
You must pay, sir.

01:26:55.625 --> 01:26:57.875
What, did they have a half day
at school today?

01:26:58.625 --> 01:27:00.458
Huh? Who says I should pay for this?

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:02.583
You? You says?

01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:03.708
Is that it?

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.041
I'm talking to you,
not your faggot friends.

01:27:07.708 --> 01:27:09.041
I've got a better idea.

01:27:09.125 --> 01:27:11.833
How about I just eat all of them?

01:27:11.916 --> 01:27:15.083
And that way, there's no fucking evidence.
Hmm?

01:27:15.958 --> 01:27:17.916
You are under arrest.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.916
Okay, why don't you grow a foot
and come back and talk to me man-to-man?

01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:23.785
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:29.125
You mean business?
How's this for business?

01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:31.163
Fifty cents worth of candy?

01:27:31.208 --> 01:27:34.291
How about I pop out your pupil
and put the change in the socket?

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:37.250
Cactus, don't fuck up
your last night in Berlin.

01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:44.458
Cactus, come on. Come on.

01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:47.291
That's for fucking with my shit.

01:27:47.375 --> 01:27:49.250
Please.

01:27:49.333 --> 01:27:51.000
Please. Please.

01:27:51.958 --> 01:27:53.416
There you go.

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:56.708
It's a little word,
but it makes such a difference.

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:56.791
It's a crime to be so selfish

01:28:56.875 --> 01:28:58.958
when there's so much of me
to go round, right?

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.041
What's happened to your lip?

01:29:01.958 --> 01:29:05.666
Oh, um... I tripped. Such a klutz.

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:08.875
Have you ever played seesaw?

01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:10.309
- You don't know seesaw?
- No.

01:29:10.333 --> 01:29:12.083
They have seesaws here, right?

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.375
Yeah.

01:29:13.458 --> 01:29:15.791
Never taken Josie to a park
all this time in Berlin?

01:29:16.083 --> 01:29:18.541
I'm gonna teach you girls everything.
I'm gonna teach you...

01:29:18.625 --> 01:29:20.875
kick the can, monkey in the middle.

01:29:20.958 --> 01:29:22.625
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Yeah?

01:29:22.708 --> 01:29:24.416
Teach you four square? Ever played?

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.500
- Let's go.
- No.

01:29:25.583 --> 01:29:28.208
If we play four square,
we might need some more rubbers.

01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:29.416
Come on. Let's go.

01:29:32.833 --> 01:29:33.833
You okay?

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:37.708
Yeah, yeah. Fucking fantastisch.

01:30:00.333 --> 01:30:02.250
Maksim, talk to me.

01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:07.875
All right, I'm gonna be there
in 15 minutes.

01:30:08.291 --> 01:30:10.458
Do you think you could...

01:30:10.541 --> 01:30:11.875
Josie? Hmm.

01:30:12.583 --> 01:30:14.375
Sure, she can stay.
She's no trouble.

01:30:16.791 --> 01:30:19.666
That's it, baby girl.
You want more?

01:30:23.375 --> 01:30:26.458
You know what? It's all right.
I'm gonna take her with me.

01:30:27.791 --> 01:30:31.458
Hey, wanna go for a ride with Daddy? Yeah?

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.041
Bye-bye.

01:30:42.208 --> 01:30:44.291
Hey, isn't that Maksim's car?

01:30:44.375 --> 01:30:45.833
What? I can't believe it.

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.083
Leo?

01:33:32.083 --> 01:33:33.583
Jesus Christ.

01:33:35.875 --> 01:33:36.875
What the hell?

01:33:40.791 --> 01:33:43.250
It's all right. Don't move.
Don't move, it's okay.

01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:47.750
Are you in some kind of turf war
or something? What the hell happened?

01:33:47.833 --> 01:33:50.875
Barman. The barman...

01:33:52.083 --> 01:33:53.416
He's looking for you.

01:33:54.916 --> 01:33:56.666
He has your address.

01:34:00.708 --> 01:34:01.958
Where are the documents?

01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:05.541
Where the fuck are my IDs, Maksim?

01:34:05.625 --> 01:34:06.750
He took them.

01:34:07.833 --> 01:34:08.916
Took them.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:26.000
Yeah,
I'll give her a surprise. A big surprise.

01:34:27.208 --> 01:34:28.791
Got your seat belt on, sweetie?

01:34:29.583 --> 01:34:31.166
What's going on in here?

01:35:18.041 --> 01:35:18.875
Duck!

01:35:18.958 --> 01:35:22.333
You hear me? He's got my papers
and he's got my address.

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:24.916
I'm dropping Josie at the... Move!

01:35:25.666 --> 01:35:28.266
I'm dropping Josie at the parlor
and then I'm home. Meet me there.

01:35:28.875 --> 01:35:30.392
If you have any information

01:35:30.416 --> 01:35:33.416
on American military personnel
absent without leave,

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.916
please notify MPs in your district.

01:36:14.291 --> 01:36:15.291
Shh.

01:36:43.458 --> 01:36:45.125
Wait here. I'll be right back.

01:37:41.583 --> 01:37:44.750
You think I'm gonna let you take
my daughter away from me? Huh?

01:37:45.291 --> 01:37:46.500
That's insane.

01:37:47.166 --> 01:37:50.125
You're crazy. You're a crazy
fucking bitch, you know that?

01:37:52.458 --> 01:37:53.625
She's family.

01:37:54.333 --> 01:37:55.666
She's my blood.

01:37:57.958 --> 01:38:00.083
I'll kill you before I let that happen.

01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:03.041
You're evil!

01:38:05.833 --> 01:38:07.166
You are evil!

01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:20.041
You need time to get
your mind right, Naadi.

01:38:21.083 --> 01:38:22.083
That's it.

01:38:25.041 --> 01:38:26.458
You need a lot of time.

01:38:47.791 --> 01:38:49.083
Jesus, Nicky,

01:38:49.916 --> 01:38:51.458
these stairs are gonna kill ya.

01:39:08.958 --> 01:39:10.208
Here.

01:39:11.666 --> 01:39:12.666
Go ahead.

01:39:14.208 --> 01:39:15.208
Open it.

01:39:36.833 --> 01:39:37.916
Did you make this?

01:39:38.958 --> 01:39:40.666
This is some quality work.

01:39:42.416 --> 01:39:43.875
I like the dolphins.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.916
Hey, can you make me some bookshelves?

01:39:56.208 --> 01:39:58.375
I take your silence as a "no."

01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.041
Where do you think you're going,
you big, dumb son of a bitch?

01:40:47.333 --> 01:40:50.666
You gonna give me some trouble, big boy?

01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:51.750
Huh?

01:40:52.958 --> 01:40:56.750
Or are you gonna channel
that famous Amish Gelassenheit serenity?

01:41:03.416 --> 01:41:05.916
Jeez.

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:09.500
What the fuck did she ever see
in a fruitcake like you?

01:41:15.583 --> 01:41:16.791
Fuck you.

01:41:18.375 --> 01:41:20.125
Fucking mute freak.

01:43:22.708 --> 01:43:24.541
Lose your keys, Cactus?

01:43:43.625 --> 01:43:44.625
Shit.

01:43:46.833 --> 01:43:49.875
Oh, fuck, man. Oh.

01:43:58.250 --> 01:44:00.500
Oh, that's bad, babe.

01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:06.416
I don't think there's anything
I can do here. Maybe I can...

01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:10.416
Maybe if I got you back to my place
or maybe a hospital, where I...

01:44:13.625 --> 01:44:15.541
Is that what... You want a hospital?

01:44:18.333 --> 01:44:20.291
Oh, I don't think so, babe. I...

01:44:21.291 --> 01:44:24.875
They'll talk. They'll say something.
They'll call the police.

01:44:26.791 --> 01:44:28.875
No, you don't want that, babe.

01:44:38.833 --> 01:44:41.250
Leo, stop hiding.

01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:43.208
You are so beautiful.

01:44:43.291 --> 01:44:47.083
Da stargo tora. The black of my eyes.

01:45:14.791 --> 01:45:16.833
Why'd you have to kill Naad, babe?

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:19.500
You had it made.

01:45:21.708 --> 01:45:23.125
All this over a broad?

01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:25.625
You're smarter than that.

01:45:32.375 --> 01:45:34.750
I always knew your temper
was gonna get you into trouble.

01:45:43.708 --> 01:45:45.666
You should have been nicer to me, Bill.

01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:48.416
There you two lovebirds are.

01:46:52.958 --> 01:46:55.833
You and I need to have a talk.

01:47:30.625 --> 01:47:33.458
You know who had a great voice?
My grandpa.

01:47:33.541 --> 01:47:36.916
Smoked three packs a day.
Had to have his voice box removed.

01:47:37.625 --> 01:47:40.125
When you start out,
you're gonna sound something like that.

01:48:00.625 --> 01:48:03.458
Big fella like you is gonna need
a deeper voice than that, right?

01:48:09.291 --> 01:48:10.291
Yeah.

01:48:15.833 --> 01:48:17.708
She's watching cartoons.

01:48:24.166 --> 01:48:25.166
Kids, right?

01:48:29.416 --> 01:48:31.000
You killed that little girl's dad.

01:48:32.375 --> 01:48:33.375
Hmm?

01:48:35.583 --> 01:48:36.958
You did that.

01:48:37.041 --> 01:48:38.125
Not me. You.

01:48:40.291 --> 01:48:41.875
You should apologize.

01:48:48.166 --> 01:48:50.083
Stop the pain.

01:48:50.166 --> 01:48:54.333
I'm so sorry I killed your buddy Cactus.

01:48:54.416 --> 01:48:55.708
Yeah, well, you should be sorry.

01:48:57.291 --> 01:48:58.541
Say you're sorry.

01:49:02.791 --> 01:49:04.041
Fucking say it!

01:49:12.666 --> 01:49:13.833
There.

01:49:32.291 --> 01:49:33.708
Now, say it.

01:49:36.125 --> 01:49:37.125
Say it.

01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:42.708
I got an idea.

01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:46.416
I'm gonna show you something.

01:49:51.458 --> 01:49:53.458
...then dip into France,
we can go anywhere.

01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:56.791
We can go to Florence,
we can go to London, go to Cannes...

01:49:57.708 --> 01:49:59.666
see all the movie stars.

01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:03.791
Let's just say we can have a lot of fun,
baby. A lot of fun.

01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:10.083
Morning, sir. Was wondering
when you might be joining us.

01:50:11.875 --> 01:50:12.875
You look beat.

01:50:15.291 --> 01:50:18.625
Oh, uh, Josie, this is Leo.
Leo, this is Josie.

01:50:18.708 --> 01:50:22.541
The young lady and I were just discussing
the splendors of the Cote d'Azur.

01:50:22.625 --> 01:50:25.416
You have any tales
you'd like to regale us with?

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:27.666
Stories of the French high life?

01:50:31.666 --> 01:50:32.666
Nothing?

01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.041
Josie, how about you?

01:50:38.166 --> 01:50:39.166
Nothing?

01:50:39.875 --> 01:50:40.875
Huh.

01:50:44.833 --> 01:50:46.113
You may have your father's eyes,

01:50:46.166 --> 01:50:48.208
but you do not have
his knack for conversation.

01:50:48.875 --> 01:50:51.666
It's supposed to be fun.
You're supposed to be having fun.

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:13.083
Hi, Bill.
Your battery is at 37%.

01:51:14.916 --> 01:51:15.916
Anything?

01:51:18.166 --> 01:51:19.541
Go ahead, say something.

01:51:21.083 --> 01:51:22.375
Did all that work.

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.583
All right, you stay in the car, darling.

01:52:50.458 --> 01:52:52.166
Uncle Duck's gotta drop Leo off.

01:53:14.208 --> 01:53:15.458
You recognize this place?

01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:18.750
No?

01:53:21.541 --> 01:53:24.541
Your photo of Naadirah...

01:53:25.916 --> 01:53:26.916
I took it...

01:53:28.333 --> 01:53:29.333
here.

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.517
Bill and I used to come up here
with Naadi in the summer

01:53:35.541 --> 01:53:37.208
with her friends, back in the day.

01:53:39.625 --> 01:53:41.208
She was a real hottie back then.

01:53:42.666 --> 01:53:44.458
Before she got all fucking knocked up.

01:53:54.708 --> 01:53:55.708
You see that?

01:53:57.375 --> 01:53:59.291
Ain't that the sweetest thing?

01:54:00.625 --> 01:54:04.916
It's funny, you know, because now...
they're together forever because of you.

01:54:06.208 --> 01:54:07.208
You did that.

01:54:08.625 --> 01:54:09.708
Fucking you!

01:54:14.375 --> 01:54:15.791
Well, I tried, Bill!

01:54:17.916 --> 01:54:19.875
Fucking goon's got a heart of stone.

01:54:36.541 --> 01:54:37.625
Looks high.

01:54:42.291 --> 01:54:43.166
Shit!

01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:47.541
I chopped your girlfriend's tits off
and I wore them as fucking earmuffs!

01:54:52.083 --> 01:54:53.125
Fucking say it.

01:54:59.458 --> 01:55:02.375
You fucking say it. You fucking say it!

01:55:03.958 --> 01:55:04.958
You fucking say it.

01:55:06.166 --> 01:55:09.250
"I'm sorry, Duck.
I'm sorry about your friend."

01:55:09.333 --> 01:55:12.000
"I'm sorry that I did that to him."

01:55:14.791 --> 01:55:18.541
Get the fuck off of me!
Get the fuck off!

01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:29.250
Leo!

01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:31.583
Leo!

01:56:33.125 --> 01:56:35.125
Leo, are you okay?

01:56:54.166 --> 01:56:55.166
No!

01:56:55.708 --> 01:56:57.291
Josie, get back!

01:57:02.083 --> 01:57:03.333
It's dangerous!

01:57:10.791 --> 01:57:12.083
It's dangerous.

01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:40.166
You sound funny.

01:57:45.666 --> 01:57:46.833
So do you.

01:57:51.708 --> 01:57:54.833
I'll take you to your grandmother.
She misses you.
