WEBVTT

00:01.922 --> 00:04.657
It was my lucky day when
I met you on the 151 bus.

00:04.659 --> 00:06.592
Yeah. I got to thank
that shirtless crackhead

00:06.594 --> 00:08.727
who scared you into sitting next to me.

00:08.729 --> 00:10.129
Yo, look,

00:10.131 --> 00:11.330
I know it's last-minute, but, you know,

00:11.332 --> 00:12.898
there's an art walk
tonight, you trying to go?

00:12.900 --> 00:14.280
- Sure.
- Yeah?

00:14.311 --> 00:16.402
Then maybe after we could get drinks?

00:16.404 --> 00:17.636
Oh, like at your place?

00:17.638 --> 00:19.708
Has to be. I don't get paid till Friday.

00:20.741 --> 00:21.941
- Mmm.
- All right, see you.

00:21.943 --> 00:24.877
Interesting. An art walk in Uptown.

00:24.879 --> 00:26.645
On your right, the Picasso sculpture,

00:26.647 --> 00:28.581
and on your left, a
urine-stained mattress.

00:29.884 --> 00:32.750
Well, I'm hoping that art
walk turns into an art hangout

00:32.753 --> 00:34.987
which leads to an art
let's-take-our-pants-off.

00:36.223 --> 00:37.756
Hey, kid, you ready for tonight?

00:37.758 --> 00:38.724
What you talking about?

00:38.726 --> 00:40.326
The Hawks are playing the Redwings.

00:40.328 --> 00:42.127
If we win, we're in the playoffs.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.662
- Oh, that's tonight.
- Yeah!

00:43.664 --> 00:45.664
Oh, listen, it's gonna be
a cold one, so I thought

00:45.666 --> 00:47.967
I'd make a little fire and
make some hot chocolate.

00:47.969 --> 00:49.668
I know, dairy doesn't agree with you,

00:49.670 --> 00:51.960
but I got that soy
milk that you love. Huh?

00:54.641 --> 00:57.576
Damn. Dude needs a girlfriend, man.

00:57.578 --> 00:59.278
Looks like he's got one.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.947
Ha!

01:03.037 --> 01:04.950
Hey, look, Arthur, man,
I-I can't watch the game.

01:04.974 --> 01:06.005
What?

01:06.052 --> 01:08.354
Oh, how are we gonna win if we
don't wear our lucky jerseys?

01:08.356 --> 01:10.589
And rub the gnome's belly?

01:10.860 --> 01:12.237
Arthur, listen, the thing is,

01:12.243 --> 01:14.093
I already made plans with Nadine, okay?

01:14.095 --> 01:17.429
And I was kind of hoping that
she and I would rub bellies.

01:18.532 --> 01:19.999
- I'm-I'm sorry for flaking.
- That's all right.

01:20.001 --> 01:22.835
Just be more hot chocolate for me.

01:22.837 --> 01:24.670
Hot chocolate does sound good.

01:24.672 --> 01:27.806
You talking about the drink or Nadine?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.821 --> 01:41.203
Tush! There you are. You left something

01:41.263 --> 01:42.977
in the coat that you dropped
off at my dry cleaners.

01:43.180 --> 01:44.212
Really, Tush?

01:44.214 --> 01:45.614
You don't seem a dry
cleaning kind of guy.

01:45.616 --> 01:46.882
Fawz and I bartered.

01:46.884 --> 01:49.885
I did a little animal show
for his niece's birthday.

01:49.887 --> 01:51.954
Unfortunately, one of
the mice gave birth,

01:51.956 --> 01:55.390
and then the snake ate the babies...

01:55.392 --> 01:57.392
So there were some tears.

01:57.394 --> 02:00.902
But that's the circle of
life! Which I then sang.

02:02.165 --> 02:05.000
Needless to say, someone's
not gonna forget turning five.

02:05.002 --> 02:06.568
And thank you.

02:06.570 --> 02:10.104
A check for $600. You
know, you should cash that.

02:10.107 --> 02:13.008
I'm sure Elizabeth Miller
would appreciate that.

02:13.010 --> 02:14.242
You're right, I will.

02:14.244 --> 02:16.211
And it's dated from two months ago.

02:16.213 --> 02:17.746
For someone living check to check,

02:17.748 --> 02:19.948
this sure is a curious oversight.

02:19.950 --> 02:22.017
Well, this was fun. I gotta go.

02:22.019 --> 02:25.153
Oh, my God, is that Bruce Springsteen?

02:25.155 --> 02:27.456
Bruce?

02:27.458 --> 02:29.637
That was a Dominican
woman wearing a bandana.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.096
Something fishy is going on here.

02:34.098 --> 02:36.298
I've seen every episode
of a little show called

02:36.300 --> 02:39.334
CSI Colon Crime Scene Investigation...

02:39.336 --> 02:42.804
so I know when information
is being kept from me.

02:42.806 --> 02:46.141
Like how to say the name of a TV show?

02:46.143 --> 02:48.910
Leave it alone, Fawz.
It's none of our business.

02:48.912 --> 02:52.581
I'm a businessman, Maya.
Everything is my business.

02:57.854 --> 03:01.823
Stop talking!

03:01.825 --> 03:04.593
Randy, we didn't say nothing.

03:04.595 --> 03:07.829
No, it's not you. My mom's in town.

03:07.831 --> 03:10.504
I've been holding that
in since breakfast.

03:11.535 --> 03:14.169
All she wants to do is shop.

03:14.171 --> 03:17.172
We went to T.J.Maxx,
then we went to Marshalls.

03:17.174 --> 03:19.908
It's the same store.

03:19.910 --> 03:21.710
Oh, no, but you love your mom.

03:21.712 --> 03:23.345
Yeah, I do.

03:23.347 --> 03:25.981
And I think she's been really
lonely ever since my dad died.

03:25.983 --> 03:26.513
Mm-hmm.

03:26.545 --> 03:28.247
So I'm trying to spend
more time with her.

03:28.252 --> 03:32.287
Randy, honey, I've got great news!

03:32.289 --> 03:35.524
Ross Dress for Less has just opened up

03:35.526 --> 03:37.759
a new store on the corner.

03:37.761 --> 03:40.328
Oh, that is great, Mom.

03:40.330 --> 03:43.532
I've been looking for something
flammable in a primary color.

03:44.902 --> 03:47.035
Do I hear Helen DeLuca?

03:47.037 --> 03:48.670
Oh!

03:48.672 --> 03:50.205
- Arthur, oh, my!
- Look at you.

03:52.009 --> 03:54.609
Well, Florida's been treating you well.

03:54.611 --> 03:56.178
Oh, thanks.

03:56.180 --> 03:59.414
This place is so filled with memories.

03:59.416 --> 04:02.884
I can just picture Leo sitting
over here at this table.

04:02.886 --> 04:05.620
Yep, there he was, whiling
away the day, eating donuts.

04:05.622 --> 04:09.313
Yes, and now his daughter
carries that torch.

04:13.162 --> 04:14.529
Hey, listen, I'm gonna
get you a cup of coffee,

04:14.531 --> 04:15.697
and, uh, we'll catch up, all right?

04:15.699 --> 04:17.531
Oh, that, I'd love it, I'd love it.

04:17.534 --> 04:21.168
Uh, Randy, honey, what
about our shopping spree?

04:21.171 --> 04:23.004
I was gonna get you a bathing suit.

04:23.006 --> 04:27.008
With a skirt. It's
time, honey, it's time.

04:28.878 --> 04:31.713
It's like she forgets I have a gun.

04:31.715 --> 04:34.382
It's okay, Mom. We got all week to shop.

04:34.384 --> 04:37.185
Yo, Arthur... Helen seems pretty dope.

04:37.187 --> 04:38.553
Yeah, she's a barrel of laughs.

04:38.555 --> 04:40.722
We all had such great times together.

04:40.724 --> 04:42.457
Yeah?

04:42.459 --> 04:44.426
Hey, Helen! You like the Blackhawks?

04:44.428 --> 04:47.389
Oh, I love 'em! Arthur,

04:47.522 --> 04:50.365
remember we went to Flannigan's
to watch all the games?

04:50.367 --> 04:52.100
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Is that place still around?

04:52.102 --> 04:54.169
Yeah, it's still there.
Except Flannigan's dead.

04:54.171 --> 04:56.972
His son shot him, it's a tragic story.

04:58.374 --> 05:00.275
Hey, why don't you two watch
the game together tonight?

05:00.277 --> 05:01.276
Oh, that sounds like fun.

05:01.278 --> 05:03.278
Great! It's a date.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.246
Okay.

05:04.248 --> 05:05.614
Hey, Randy, come here. Guess what.

05:05.616 --> 05:07.349
So, your mom and Arthur are
gonna watch the Hawks game

05:07.351 --> 05:08.383
tonight at Flannigan's.

05:08.385 --> 05:10.352
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

05:10.354 --> 05:13.155
That's incredible. I get a night alone.

05:13.157 --> 05:14.523
In my pajamas.

05:15.492 --> 05:17.359
- Drinking a bottle of wine.
- Mm-hmm.

05:17.361 --> 05:19.728
Maybe two.

05:19.730 --> 05:22.430
Maybe no pajamas.

05:22.432 --> 05:24.833
You add in some Drake and
a couple weed lollipops,

05:24.835 --> 05:27.002
and you just described my
night with Nadine, yeah.

05:31.140 --> 05:34.276
Well, the plot thickens.

05:34.278 --> 05:36.444
Look what else I found in Tush's pocket.

05:36.446 --> 05:39.481
A book of matches from
the Palmer House Hotel.

05:39.483 --> 05:43.985
So... $600 from a lady. Fancy hotel.

05:43.987 --> 05:47.656
Conclusion: Tush is a gigolo.

05:48.858 --> 05:50.725
Fawz, you are out of your mind.

05:50.727 --> 05:53.461
I don't mean to body-shame,
but there is no way

05:53.463 --> 05:55.597
that Tush is a gigolo.

05:55.599 --> 05:59.701
Yeah, he's more jiggly than gigolo.

05:59.703 --> 06:02.404
We all know he is not
shy about his gigs.

06:02.406 --> 06:07.475
The man modeled adult
diapers and bragged about it.

06:07.477 --> 06:09.678
What could be so
embarrassing that he would

06:09.680 --> 06:10.879
keep it from his friends?

06:10.881 --> 06:12.948
You really need to stop prying.

06:12.950 --> 06:15.250
With an attitude like
that, I have half a mind

06:15.252 --> 06:16.618
to take you off this case.

06:19.355 --> 06:20.856
Arthur, aren't you meeting Helen soon?

06:20.858 --> 06:21.990
Yeah, in 20 minutes.

06:21.992 --> 06:23.124
Well, shouldn't you get dressed?

06:23.126 --> 06:24.559
I am dressed. I'm fine.

06:24.561 --> 06:26.461
No, you look like a Jewish scarecrow.

06:26.463 --> 06:27.863
Hmm?

06:27.865 --> 06:30.098
Or like a two-star Uber driver.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.700
I get it, I get it, I get it.

06:31.702 --> 06:33.969
Well, I'm just saying, man, I just
want you to look nice for your date.

06:33.971 --> 06:35.570
No. Date? No.

06:35.572 --> 06:38.206
Helen's an old friend of mine,
you can't call this a date.

06:38.208 --> 06:39.741
All right, well, let
me ask you something:

06:39.743 --> 06:41.176
- you gonna pick her up?
- Sure.

06:41.178 --> 06:42.711
- You gonna hold the door for her?
- Of course.

06:42.713 --> 06:46.514
- Will you pay for dinner?
- Oh, my God, it's a date.

06:46.516 --> 06:48.149
Listen, I can't go on a
date looking like this.

06:48.151 --> 06:50.418
- Yeah.
- Can you help me pick out an outfit?

06:50.420 --> 06:52.220
Yeah! Yeah, all right, sure.

06:52.222 --> 06:54.422
Okay, that's great.

07:05.501 --> 07:07.235
Did he just lock us in?

07:07.237 --> 07:08.570
Let's make a pact:

07:08.572 --> 07:10.956
if things go south,
we eat that guy first.

07:15.244 --> 07:17.479
I haven't dated in 50 years.

07:17.481 --> 07:19.447
So what am I supposed
to do? Come on, help me.

07:19.449 --> 07:20.877
I got you.

07:20.883 --> 07:23.451
Oh, my God, why do you
have so many visors, man?

07:23.453 --> 07:25.654
Are you an old Korean lady?

07:25.656 --> 07:28.623
Come on, I'm so nervous.

07:28.625 --> 07:31.092
I'm sweating in places I
didn't powder this morning.

07:31.094 --> 07:33.895
Look, uh, maybe it's a bad idea.

07:33.897 --> 07:36.431
Arthur, this is gonna
be great. All right?

07:36.433 --> 07:37.565
And I saw you checking out Helen

07:37.567 --> 07:38.667
when she was walking out the door.

07:38.669 --> 07:40.602
I was admiring her scarf.

07:41.304 --> 07:43.271
Okay, I was looking at her butt.

07:44.273 --> 07:46.308
Look, it's Helen and me.
I mean, this is weird.

07:46.310 --> 07:48.209
I was best man at her wedding.

07:48.211 --> 07:50.979
Is that where you wore this?

07:50.981 --> 07:53.882
Or were you a pallbearer
at Papa Smurf's funeral?

07:55.184 --> 07:56.484
Come on, Arthur.

07:56.486 --> 07:57.852
Don't you think it'd be good for you

07:57.854 --> 07:59.287
to have a lady in your life?

07:59.289 --> 08:01.556
Yes, I guess so, yeah.

08:01.558 --> 08:04.059
Oh, hey.

08:04.061 --> 08:05.527
How about this?

08:07.797 --> 08:12.300
Hmm. Part Sam Jackson, part Pepe Le Pew.

08:13.302 --> 08:14.369
I can work with this.

08:18.441 --> 08:19.975
All right, my bad.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.543
Just gonna grab my
phone and we can bounce.

08:21.545 --> 08:25.013
Uh, so, how did you leave your
phone in your boss' bedroom?

08:25.015 --> 08:26.915
Well, it ain't like that.
I put it down when I was

08:26.917 --> 08:29.651
helping him squeeze
into a pair of pants.

08:30.786 --> 08:31.820
That wasn't any better.

08:31.822 --> 08:33.922
All right. Mwah. I'll be right back.

08:40.196 --> 08:41.629
Hey!

08:41.631 --> 08:44.899
What the hell, kid?

08:44.901 --> 08:46.735
Came here to get my phone!

08:46.737 --> 08:49.004
Oh! That was your phone?

08:49.006 --> 08:50.587
You might want to delete the photos.

08:58.456 --> 08:59.755
You don't have to knock.

08:59.757 --> 09:01.891
Yes, I do.

09:02.826 --> 09:05.962
Oh, come on, please,
you hardly saw anything.

09:05.964 --> 09:07.797
Mm-hmm. You got a birthmark on your back

09:07.799 --> 09:10.132
in the shape of Florida.

09:10.134 --> 09:12.802
Okay, you saw everything.

09:12.804 --> 09:14.504
Yo, so what happened last night?

09:14.506 --> 09:16.172
I thought y'all were just
hanging out at Flannigan's.

09:16.174 --> 09:17.740
Yeah, we... well, we were
having a couple of drinks

09:17.742 --> 09:19.575
and, uh, talking about old times.

09:19.577 --> 09:21.744
And then I asked her
back for a nightcap.

09:21.746 --> 09:23.312
Next thing I knew, we were spooning

09:23.314 --> 09:24.580
on top of the heating pad.

09:24.582 --> 09:26.449
Good for you!

09:26.451 --> 09:28.187
Yeah! Well, it was kind of nice.

09:28.257 --> 09:30.186
All right, so what happens
next, 50 Shades of Gray?

09:32.457 --> 09:33.890
When are you gonna see her again?

09:33.892 --> 09:35.157
I'd like to.

09:35.159 --> 09:36.726
But, you know, I haven't
dated in so many years.

09:36.728 --> 09:38.261
You know, wha-what I
am supposed to do, huh?

09:38.263 --> 09:39.791
Call her? Send her flowers?

09:39.830 --> 09:41.664
No, man, just send her a text!

09:41.666 --> 09:43.032
- Really? Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

09:43.034 --> 09:46.402
Just send a... a text.

09:46.404 --> 09:48.067
Okay, so what do I, what do I say?

09:48.161 --> 09:50.406
Um, something flirty but noncommittal.

09:50.408 --> 09:51.941
Like, "Hey, what you doin'?"

09:51.943 --> 09:54.912
Which can be interpreted
as, "Hey, what you doin'?"

09:54.918 --> 09:56.512
Or like you're doing
something nasty, like

09:56.514 --> 09:58.748
"Hey, what you doin'?"

09:58.750 --> 10:00.049
What next?

10:00.051 --> 10:02.084
Um, "You had fun last
night? Let's chill again."

10:02.086 --> 10:04.058
- Ooh.
- Eggplant emoji.

10:06.490 --> 10:08.424
- Just do it, just do it. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

10:08.426 --> 10:11.160
Now send! Yep! There we go.

10:11.162 --> 10:12.495
That sounds perfect.

10:14.032 --> 10:15.648
Except you just sent it to me.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.269
- Give me your phone.
- Ah.

10:22.673 --> 10:24.173
Look at this, it's
been a couple of hours,

10:24.175 --> 10:25.174
she hasn't even responded.

10:25.190 --> 10:27.729
Give her some time. Maybe
she can't work a phone.

10:27.735 --> 10:29.111
We've texted before.

10:29.113 --> 10:30.413
Maybe I should've called her.

10:30.415 --> 10:32.582
Hmm? I don't come across in a text.

10:32.584 --> 10:35.785
All my sexy is in my voice.

10:35.787 --> 10:38.054
What a night.

10:38.056 --> 10:40.690
I had five wonderful
hours without my mother.

10:40.692 --> 10:43.930
Which should add about
three months to my life.

10:45.596 --> 10:46.996
Well, lucky for you, you might

10:46.998 --> 10:49.599
be having some more mom-free nights.

10:49.601 --> 10:50.800
What are you talking about?

10:50.802 --> 10:52.234
Oh, you don't know? Well, apparently,

10:52.236 --> 10:54.070
your mom and Arthur's hockey date

10:54.072 --> 10:55.342
went into overtime.

10:57.307 --> 10:58.908
Huh?

10:58.910 --> 11:02.111
He shot, he scored.

11:02.113 --> 11:04.246
- Oh, my God.
- Uh-huh.

11:04.248 --> 11:06.215
- My mother?
- Uh-huh.

11:06.217 --> 11:07.732
- And Arthur?
- Uh-huh!

11:09.886 --> 11:11.454
Oh, hey, Randy...

11:11.456 --> 11:12.788
Hi, Arthur.

11:12.790 --> 11:15.591
Heard that you and my
mom had a fun night.

11:15.593 --> 11:17.193
Ah, uh, oh. Yeah, listen,

11:17.195 --> 11:19.462
I know this is kind of
weird for you, but...

11:19.464 --> 11:22.932
No. Actually, it's not weird.

11:22.934 --> 11:25.935
I-I'm okay with it, I-I'm happy for you.

11:25.937 --> 11:28.804
Oh, really? Well, okay,
all right. Thank you.

11:28.806 --> 11:30.573
Yeah. It's actually pretty exciting.

11:30.575 --> 11:32.508
Means I might be getting a new dad.

11:32.510 --> 11:34.744
Oh, come on. Very funny.

11:34.746 --> 11:36.178
Yeah, maybe this weekend
we could watch Frozen.

11:36.180 --> 11:38.314
Oh, all right, all right, all right.

11:38.316 --> 11:40.784
I'm gonna go meet Mom
to do some more shopping.

11:40.790 --> 11:42.785
Oh! Speaking of shopping.

11:42.787 --> 11:45.721
For Christmas I'd really like a pony.

11:45.723 --> 11:47.323
Oh, get out of here.

11:48.626 --> 11:50.391
Ooh, that's a text.

11:50.397 --> 11:51.127
It's in my back pocket.

11:51.129 --> 11:52.361
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:52.363 --> 11:53.663
I'm, I-I'm all glazed up.

11:53.665 --> 11:55.197
It's all good. Oh!

11:55.199 --> 11:56.432
It's from Helen.

11:56.434 --> 11:58.401
- Ah, ah, ah.
- Yeah.

11:58.403 --> 11:59.835
"Dear Arthur.

11:59.837 --> 12:01.504
"Thank you for the texts.

12:01.506 --> 12:03.639
The game was fun last night."

12:03.641 --> 12:04.607
Oh.

12:04.609 --> 12:06.676
Ooh...

12:06.678 --> 12:08.978
"But I don't think hanging
out is a good idea."

12:10.114 --> 12:11.981
"Last night was a mistake."

12:12.971 --> 12:16.152
"Sincerely yours, Helen DeLuca"

12:17.421 --> 12:19.722
Enough dings.

12:19.724 --> 12:21.791
Oh, no, this is from
your cell phone provider.

12:21.793 --> 12:23.795
Uh, you used up all
your texts for the month.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.124
Ugh. I'm worried about Tush.

12:31.268 --> 12:32.667
Don't believe Pretty Woman.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.804
Not every customer is Richard Gere.

12:35.806 --> 12:37.836
You really think he's a prostitute?

12:37.842 --> 12:39.341
Shh! Here he comes.

12:39.343 --> 12:42.043
Don't say "sex."

12:42.045 --> 12:43.411
Afternoon.

12:43.413 --> 12:44.460
- Morning.
- Intercourse.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.653
Tush, we have a brochure for you.

12:51.655 --> 12:54.130
It's called "Getting Out of the Game."

12:54.588 --> 12:56.208
Game? What are you talking about?

12:56.214 --> 13:00.040
You know. How you put on the red light?

13:00.244 --> 13:01.910
You think I'm a prostitute?

13:01.912 --> 13:04.012
How else could you
earn such a big check?

13:04.014 --> 13:06.348
It is the only explanation.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.283
It's from my ex-wife.

13:08.285 --> 13:10.852
Except for that.

13:10.854 --> 13:12.654
That's who Elizabeth Miller is?

13:12.656 --> 13:14.623
Formerly Liz Tushinski.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.458
She pays me alimony.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.526
We got divorced after I lost my job,

13:18.528 --> 13:20.695
and she was making a
lot more money than me.

13:20.697 --> 13:23.098
So, then, why have you
not cashed the check?

13:23.100 --> 13:25.800
'Cause it's the last one.

13:25.802 --> 13:28.136
It's the only thing
that ties us together.

13:28.138 --> 13:33.308
When this goes in the bank,
she's out of my life forever.

13:35.145 --> 13:37.412
I am so sorry, you know.

13:37.414 --> 13:38.947
Being in the dry-cleaning business,

13:38.949 --> 13:41.081
there just is not a
lot of excitement, so...

13:41.097 --> 13:45.553
sometimes my imagination just runs wild.

13:45.555 --> 13:47.555
It's okay. I guess...

13:47.557 --> 13:51.159
I've just had a real hard
time admitting it's over.

13:51.161 --> 13:53.662
You know, maybe I should just move on.

13:53.664 --> 13:55.163
My friend.

13:55.165 --> 13:58.168
How about you and I go to the bank

13:58.215 --> 14:00.480
and cash that check together?

14:02.105 --> 14:04.105
I'd like that.

14:09.867 --> 14:11.680
Uh, Fawz.

14:11.682 --> 14:13.415
Oh, yes.

14:13.417 --> 14:17.552
Uh, holding hands is a sign
of kinship in my country.

14:17.554 --> 14:19.254
Oh. That's, that's beautiful.

14:19.256 --> 14:20.889
Yeah.

14:24.327 --> 14:27.295
So, uh, who, who lets go first?

14:27.297 --> 14:31.265
Traditionally, it's the
man who's more subservient.

14:36.105 --> 14:38.406
Huh.

14:38.408 --> 14:40.649
I wish I'd known that
before we started this.

14:43.379 --> 14:44.612
Arthur, what are you doing?

14:44.614 --> 14:45.780
We're already fully stocked on those.

14:45.782 --> 14:48.683
I know. These are for me.

14:48.685 --> 14:50.885
Hey, uh, there's a
Blackhawks game tonight.

14:50.887 --> 14:52.153
Y-You trying to watch it?

14:52.155 --> 14:53.221
I'll make hot chocolate.

14:53.223 --> 14:55.423
No, thanks.

14:55.425 --> 14:57.192
He can eat all he wants,

14:57.194 --> 15:01.730
but those donut holes will never
fill the one inside his heart.

15:01.732 --> 15:03.698
Man, I can't believe that lady.

15:03.700 --> 15:04.908
Breaking up by text?

15:04.914 --> 15:06.601
You don't do that to my boy Arthur.

15:06.603 --> 15:08.726
They're old friends.
Maybe they'll work it out.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.706
Oh. They definitely gonna work it out.

15:11.708 --> 15:12.749
'Cause you know what?

15:12.755 --> 15:14.409
She might have a problem being direct,

15:14.411 --> 15:16.011
but I don't.

15:18.614 --> 15:22.283
Okay. Well, I have a meeting.

15:24.787 --> 15:27.255
Well, I'm not letting go.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.782
Well, I'm not letting go.

15:38.868 --> 15:41.036
I have to shower before the meeting.

15:41.038 --> 15:42.828
I like it hot.

15:47.109 --> 15:48.476
- Hey, Ma.
- Yeah.

15:48.478 --> 15:49.611
Check out these winter coats.

15:49.613 --> 15:51.183
- Ugh.
- You might need one of these

15:51.222 --> 15:53.386
if you're gonnaspend
more time in Chicago

15:53.542 --> 15:56.128
with a certain donut Don Juan.

15:56.953 --> 15:59.788
Can we just let go of this?

15:59.790 --> 16:01.489
Here, take this sticker.

16:01.495 --> 16:03.998
Put it on the pink bag,
I'll get another 20% off.

16:04.123 --> 16:06.327
- Come on, come on.
- Mom, no.

16:06.329 --> 16:07.729
There you go.

16:07.731 --> 16:09.531
Hey, Franco. What are you doing here?

16:09.533 --> 16:10.932
I'm here to talk to your mother.

16:10.934 --> 16:12.600
Yo, can you stop following me?

16:12.602 --> 16:14.035
If I wanted to steal from
a store, I'd go to a place

16:14.037 --> 16:15.637
I couldn't afford.

16:15.639 --> 16:19.974
So you're just gonna
ghost my friend like that?

16:19.976 --> 16:21.409
- "Ghost"?
- Mm-hmm.

16:21.411 --> 16:23.363
Is that slang for sex?

16:23.386 --> 16:25.780
No. It's when you dump somebody by text

16:25.782 --> 16:27.636
and you disappear like
nothing ever happened.

16:27.652 --> 16:30.251
Oh. Then, yes, I ghosted him.

16:30.253 --> 16:31.986
Wait a minute.

16:31.988 --> 16:33.786
You dumped Arthur?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.115
In a text?

16:35.138 --> 16:36.497
Well, I didn't mean to hurt him.

16:36.592 --> 16:39.293
I just... well, I didn't
know what else to do.

16:39.295 --> 16:42.063
It was the first time that I
had a feeling for another man,

16:42.065 --> 16:44.765
and I... I-I just began

16:44.767 --> 16:46.133
to feel weird.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.803
'Cause it wasn't Dad?

16:48.805 --> 16:50.771
I know he's not here anymore,

16:50.773 --> 16:53.941
but I, I still feel like it's cheating.

16:53.943 --> 16:55.309
Yeah.

16:55.311 --> 16:56.777
I get it.

16:56.779 --> 16:58.979
But it happened.

16:58.981 --> 17:01.182
And Arthur is still your friend.

17:01.184 --> 17:03.751
You really want to leave it like this?

17:03.753 --> 17:05.486
But I haven't been to housewares yet,

17:05.488 --> 17:08.585
and it's 60% off everything Rachael Ray.

17:10.659 --> 17:12.026
Fine.

17:12.028 --> 17:14.328
Fine.

17:14.329 --> 17:16.063
See? I ain't steal nothing.

17:16.065 --> 17:17.865
But you might want to check
out that white lady over there.

17:17.867 --> 17:20.134
She got a George Foreman
Grill under her jacket!

17:25.507 --> 17:27.575
What's up, Arthur?

17:27.577 --> 17:29.477
Oh, Helen.

17:29.479 --> 17:31.779
I didn't think we'd
see each other again.

17:31.781 --> 17:35.015
Well, I just wanted to say I
was sorry about the text thing.

17:35.017 --> 17:37.184
Franco told me you were upset.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.452
Franco did what?

17:38.454 --> 17:40.688
He said you were devastated.

17:40.690 --> 17:42.556
Well, anyway.

17:42.558 --> 17:44.925
I just wanted to say I was sorry,

17:44.927 --> 17:48.129
so I bought you this windbreaker.

17:48.131 --> 17:52.099
It's Pierre Cardin, $80 value.

17:53.335 --> 17:55.202
You know, kid, why are you
getting involved in this?

17:55.204 --> 17:57.271
'Cause you were upset.
And eating donut holes

17:57.273 --> 17:59.740
by the fistful, man.
I had to do something.

17:59.742 --> 18:00.975
No, you didn't.

18:00.977 --> 18:02.243
This is between Helen and me.

18:02.245 --> 18:04.044
It's none of your damn business.

18:04.046 --> 18:05.746
Franco just wanted to help.

18:05.748 --> 18:07.414
We worry about you both.

18:07.416 --> 18:08.983
Why? We're adults.

18:08.985 --> 18:10.718
Yeah, we are. Adults.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.037
Yeah, but you're down in
Florida, all by yourself.

18:14.115 --> 18:15.413
Yeah, and you have nobody to watch

18:15.419 --> 18:16.223
the Hawks games with, so...

18:16.225 --> 18:18.292
We, we just don't want you to be lonely.

18:18.294 --> 18:19.794
Oh, I see.

18:19.796 --> 18:21.862
You don't want us to be lonely, okay.

18:21.864 --> 18:24.565
Raise your hand if you
got lucky last night.

18:28.825 --> 18:29.937
Damn.

18:29.939 --> 18:31.145
That's cold.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.073
What we're saying is,
focus on your own lives.

18:33.075 --> 18:34.742
Franco, you got this
beautiful girl Nadine

18:34.744 --> 18:36.043
who's crazy about you.

18:36.045 --> 18:38.178
So why you all up in my grill?

18:39.045 --> 18:40.344
Didn't I say that right?

18:40.350 --> 18:41.916
Yeah.

18:42.918 --> 18:44.051
All right. Well,

18:44.053 --> 18:45.286
if y'all say you're great,

18:45.288 --> 18:46.954
then I guess we'll just leave you alone?

18:46.956 --> 18:48.489
Thank you.

18:48.491 --> 18:51.959
Arthur, can we have
somewhere where we can talk?

18:51.961 --> 18:53.794
Yeah. Yeah.

18:55.838 --> 18:57.739
I can't believe I just
got relationship advice

18:57.745 --> 19:00.201
from a 75-year-old man.

19:00.203 --> 19:03.934
Yeah, and I can't believe my
mom's having more sex than I am.

19:05.975 --> 19:08.943
You know, Franco is right,
I owe you an explanation.

19:08.945 --> 19:10.744
Arthur, I panicked.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.528
All these complicated emotions came up,

19:13.551 --> 19:15.192
and I...

19:15.251 --> 19:18.519
We have such a, a long, shared history.

19:19.688 --> 19:21.989
You know, Leo.

19:21.991 --> 19:24.825
Yeah. Well, Joanie.

19:26.494 --> 19:28.977
Well, they're sure dead.

19:31.099 --> 19:32.700
And we're not.

19:32.702 --> 19:35.469
No, we certainly weren't last night.

19:35.471 --> 19:39.340
We gave that memory
foam a lot to remember.

19:43.144 --> 19:44.745
That's good.

19:44.747 --> 19:46.213
Hey, can I at least give you a hug?

19:46.215 --> 19:47.882
Or will that drive you mad with desire

19:47.884 --> 19:50.251
and lead to multiple
health code violations?

19:50.253 --> 19:51.252
Yes.

19:51.254 --> 19:53.621
Okay.

19:53.623 --> 19:55.456
For the love of God!

19:55.458 --> 19:57.858
Put a sock on the door.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.386
Hey, hey. What the hell, kid?

20:05.392 --> 20:06.933
You're not checking up on me, are you?

20:07.035 --> 20:08.082
No, I'm not.

20:08.183 --> 20:10.880
Hi, Nadine. He's not
checking up on me, is he?

20:10.882 --> 20:12.882
- A little.
- Wha... no. I'm just..

20:12.884 --> 20:14.233
I just came to pick up my paycheck,

20:14.239 --> 20:16.820
so I can take my girl
out for dinner and drinks.

20:17.688 --> 20:19.889
Maybe just drinks.

20:19.891 --> 20:21.391
Hey, listen! Uh, uh...

20:21.393 --> 20:23.916
Look, I'm sorry I
snapped at you yesterday.

20:23.969 --> 20:25.142
It's cool.

20:25.203 --> 20:27.681
No, no, I'm, I'm just...
I'm just glad that you, uh,

20:27.733 --> 20:29.265
pushed me to go dating again,

20:29.267 --> 20:31.234
because I think I'm
ready to go out there now.

20:31.236 --> 20:32.016
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

20:32.022 --> 20:32.975
- Word?
- Yeah.

20:33.022 --> 20:34.204
- All right.
- I signed up for this,

20:34.243 --> 20:35.399
Uh, new dating app.

20:35.438 --> 20:36.789
It shows all the singles in your area.

20:36.859 --> 20:38.828
- Uh-huh.
- But so far, it's only guys.

20:41.278 --> 20:43.580
Hey, Arthur, you, you
on Grindr right now.

20:43.582 --> 20:46.182
- Huh? Why? What's that?
- It's...

20:46.184 --> 20:48.551
- No, no. Go, go on your date. Go ahead.
- You're sure?

20:48.553 --> 20:50.854
Yeah, I'm sure this guy can
explain it to me over coffee.
