00:02.070 --> 00:03.423
Do you think...

00:04.950 --> 00:07.020
...that the security guards
in art museums...

00:07.190 --> 00:10.262
...really ever stop anybody
from taking the paintings?

00:11.070 --> 00:14.142
I mean, are they going, " Hey, where
do you think you're going with that?

00:14.310 --> 00:17.222
Come over here.
Give me that CÃ©zanne."

00:17.390 --> 00:20.143
I mean, look at the job
that this man is hired to do.

00:20.310 --> 00:22.619
He's getting $5 an hour to protect...

00:22.790 --> 00:26.419
...millions of dollars
of priceless art, with what?

00:26.590 --> 00:29.309
He's got a light mocha
brown uniform...

00:29.470 --> 00:32.223
...and a USA Today.
This is what he's got.

00:32.430 --> 00:36.264
Crooks must look at this guy and go,
"We get past the folding chair...

00:36.430 --> 00:38.819
...and the thermos of coffee,
we can get a Rembrandt."

00:48.790 --> 00:51.827
Kramer, would you hold still?
I can't do this if you keep moving.

00:52.310 --> 00:55.222
You sure you don't want me
to take my clothes off?

00:55.710 --> 00:56.984
Because I'll do it.

00:58.110 --> 01:00.670
No, that's the last thing
in the world I want you to do.

01:01.390 --> 01:03.381
Well, why don't you take
your clothes off?

01:04.550 --> 01:06.666
I don't know, I don't think
Jerry would like that.

01:06.830 --> 01:08.741
Well, it'll be our little secret.

01:12.590 --> 01:14.103
God!

01:17.270 --> 01:18.749
Button fly!

01:18.910 --> 01:21.140
Why do they put buttons on a fly?

01:21.310 --> 01:23.904
It takes 10 minutes
to get these things open.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.427
I like the button fly.

01:26.590 --> 01:28.820
- What?
- That is one place on my wardrobe...

01:28.990 --> 01:32.187
...I do not need sharp,
interlocking metal teeth.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.899
It's like a mink trap down there.

01:35.550 --> 01:37.461
I'm gonna develop kidney problems.

01:38.310 --> 01:40.028
- What are you doing today?
- Nothing.

01:40.190 --> 01:43.500
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come
up to her loft, check out her paintings?

01:43.670 --> 01:46.423
- I don't get art.
- There's nothing to get.

01:46.590 --> 01:48.182
It always has to be explained to me...

01:48.350 --> 01:51.069
...and then I have to have someone
explain the explanation.

01:51.870 --> 01:55.579
She does abstract stuff. In fact,
she's painting Kramer right now.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.742
- What for?
- She sees something in him.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.470
So do I, but I wouldn't
hang it on a wall.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.903
Are you getting the eyes?

02:05.470 --> 02:06.664
Because they're brown.

02:06.830 --> 02:10.663
Really, they're dark brown,
like rich Colombian coffee.

02:13.230 --> 02:14.583
Tell me about Elaine.

02:14.870 --> 02:16.986
You know, she and Jerry
were a big thing...

02:17.150 --> 02:19.027
...like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.

02:20.670 --> 02:23.787
- But they're still friends.
- Yeah, yeah. They're like this:

02:24.950 --> 02:28.101
- Don't you think that's strange?
- Why? What's the difference?

02:29.470 --> 02:32.030
Are you still friends with any
of your ex-girlfriends?

02:32.310 --> 02:34.744
Well, you know, I...

02:34.910 --> 02:37.105
I have many relationships.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.745
- I tell you, I'm a little nervous.
- Why?

02:41.910 --> 02:44.788
You know, the friend meeting
the new woman.

02:44.950 --> 02:47.862
I feel like I'm getting fixed up
for a friendship.

02:48.550 --> 02:50.427
I don't know how long
this is gonna last.

02:50.590 --> 02:52.820
Really?
I thought you liked her.

02:53.110 --> 02:54.941
I do, but she's got,
like, a jealousy thing.

02:55.110 --> 02:57.465
She doesn't like me having
fun with anyone but her.

02:57.790 --> 03:00.065
You know, it's a miracle
you're not married.

03:05.470 --> 03:08.064
Hey, I'm not obligated
to buy anything, am I?

03:08.390 --> 03:10.381
- Hi, Nina.
- Hi.

03:10.550 --> 03:12.029
- This is my friend George.
- Hello.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.101
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

03:14.270 --> 03:15.988
Hey, look at this guy!

03:18.270 --> 03:20.500
I brought George up to see
some of your paintings.

03:20.670 --> 03:22.501
Oh, are you interested?

03:25.950 --> 03:27.542
Yeah, sure.
Sure, I'm interested.

03:27.710 --> 03:29.985
George, you gonna buy a painting?

03:30.590 --> 03:32.182
Yeah, sure.

03:32.350 --> 03:36.343
- Are you an art lover?
- I am an art adorer. I adore art.

03:37.070 --> 03:40.346
Great. Take a look around.
Pick something out you like.

03:42.310 --> 03:43.709
May I?

03:44.790 --> 03:46.621
Get out of here.

03:47.350 --> 03:48.544
Here. Play with this.

03:48.710 --> 03:51.065
- What's this?
- My father gave me four tickets...

03:51.230 --> 03:53.585
...to the Yankee game
for Saturday afternoon.

03:53.750 --> 03:56.469
Owner's box, first row,
behind the dugout.

03:56.830 --> 03:59.390
Saturday! I'm working.
I'm going out of town.

04:00.350 --> 04:02.466
Well, I won't go without you.
You guys want them?

04:02.630 --> 04:04.063
Yeah.

04:04.230 --> 04:06.790
They're right behind the dugout,
George. First row.

04:06.950 --> 04:09.669
Behind the dugout? Are you kid...?
How did you get them?

04:09.830 --> 04:13.140
My father's the Yankees' accountant.
It's the owner's box.

04:13.310 --> 04:16.985
All my life I've dreamed of sitting
front row, behind the dugout.

04:18.029 --> 04:20.065
You like that one?

04:23.830 --> 04:25.058
Look at where we are!

04:25.230 --> 04:28.540
He's not stopping. He keeps
going and going and going.

04:29.590 --> 04:30.784
We're not in the first row?

04:30.950 --> 04:34.784
- No, no. These are your seats.
- She said first row behind the dugout.

04:34.950 --> 04:36.622
It's the second row. It's just as good.

04:36.790 --> 04:39.987
I was primed for the first row. I was
gonna put my feet on the dugout.

04:40.150 --> 04:43.267
Shut up. These are great.
You can't get any better than this.

04:43.430 --> 04:45.466
There's better. Right there.
That's better.

04:45.630 --> 04:46.824
All right.

04:47.110 --> 04:48.509
Oh, boy.

04:48.670 --> 04:51.230
- All right. Who wants a dog?
- Yeah. Here you go.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.018
What a great day.

04:53.190 --> 04:55.750
I could've been at my boss'
son's bris right now.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.509
That what you were
supposed to do?

04:57.670 --> 04:58.864
Yeah.

04:59.030 --> 05:01.828
What makes him think anyone wants
to witness a circumcision?

05:01.990 --> 05:03.946
I'd rather go to a hanging.

05:04.110 --> 05:06.829
Is it that unattractive
to have to take it off?

05:07.550 --> 05:09.029
Have you ever seen one with it?

05:09.190 --> 05:10.464
No.

05:11.030 --> 05:13.180
You wouldn't even
know what it was.

05:15.870 --> 05:17.223
Anyway, I called him back.

05:17.390 --> 05:22.020
I told him I had to visit my father
in the hospital in Maryland.

05:22.190 --> 05:25.466
You better catch it here, Charlie,
because this ain't Philadelphia!

05:25.630 --> 05:27.188
- George?
- Yeah?

05:27.350 --> 05:30.183
Hi. I'm Leonard West.

05:30.350 --> 05:33.422
- Nina's father.
- Hi, hi, Mr. West. I'm sorry.

05:33.590 --> 05:34.989
- This is my friend Elaine.
- Hi.

05:35.150 --> 05:39.302
Hey, .230 ain't gonna
cut it in this town, babe!

05:39.470 --> 05:41.028
This is Kramer.

05:41.190 --> 05:42.748
Hey, how you doing?

05:44.830 --> 05:46.343
Yes! Yes!

05:48.910 --> 05:50.628
- How are the seats?
- Okay.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.621
- Great. They're great.
- I hear you bought...

05:52.790 --> 05:55.065
...one of Nina's paintings.
- It's being framed now.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.629
I don't even know what it costs.

05:56.870 --> 05:58.622
Not too expensive, is it?

05:58.790 --> 06:00.508
Not if you have a lot of money.

06:01.350 --> 06:03.864
It was cheaper for me
when she was an actress.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.104
Well...

06:09.990 --> 06:11.787
- Enjoy the game.
- Thanks.

06:11.950 --> 06:14.225
I think you better take
off the Orioles cap.

06:14.390 --> 06:15.709
Yeah. I better.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.781
No, no. Seriously.
You're in the owner's box.

06:17.950 --> 06:19.906
I don't think it's a good idea.

06:20.070 --> 06:22.982
- You're not serious.
- Yes, yes, yes, I am.

06:24.070 --> 06:26.459
- Did he say that?
- No, but he gave me the seats.

06:26.630 --> 06:28.939
I don't think he'd like you
wearing an Orioles cap.

06:29.110 --> 06:31.066
- Maybe you should ask him.
- I don't have to.

06:31.230 --> 06:32.982
Are you gonna take
the hat off or not?

06:33.150 --> 06:34.378
No. I'm not gonna
take it off.

06:34.550 --> 06:36.029
Why should I?
That's ridiculous.

06:36.190 --> 06:37.748
Just take the cap off.

06:37.910 --> 06:40.470
George, I am at a baseball game.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.222
- This is America.
- Look!

06:42.390 --> 06:44.699
Either you take the cap off
or you leave.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.144
I'm not taking it off.

06:46.310 --> 06:48.699
- Elaine, just take the cap off.
- No! Get off of my hat!

06:48.870 --> 06:50.508
- What's...?
- What do you mean?!

06:50.670 --> 06:52.228
- Stop it!
- Just take it off!

06:54.310 --> 06:55.663
- There's your cap!
- Let's go.

06:55.830 --> 06:58.867
Oh, my God. All right,
get your hands off of me!

06:59.030 --> 07:02.067
- I'm leaving.
- Wait a minute. We just got here.

07:02.230 --> 07:03.663
Do you want us to go with you?

07:04.470 --> 07:06.062
- No, you stay.
- Get your cap, George.

07:06.230 --> 07:08.221
- Well, I was just thinking...
- Yeah. Stay!

07:08.390 --> 07:10.460
All right, all right, we'll go, we'll go.

07:18.230 --> 07:21.939
And then the ball hits him in the head,
and he falls right over the railing.

07:22.190 --> 07:24.943
- Is he okay?
- Well, yeah, he's fine.

07:25.110 --> 07:28.341
We took him to the emergency room.
The x-rays were all negative.

07:28.750 --> 07:31.059
It was quite a day.

07:31.230 --> 07:33.266
This is the most amazing story
I've ever heard.

07:33.430 --> 07:35.466
Why did he want you to take
off the baseball cap?

07:35.630 --> 07:37.029
- That is so insane.
- I know.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.260
Can you imagine that?

07:43.750 --> 07:46.059
- How you feeling?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

07:46.310 --> 07:47.902
Hi, Carol.

07:48.390 --> 07:50.301
Hey, look. We made the paper.

07:52.390 --> 07:55.382
Look at this. Page two, sports section.
We're all in the picture.

07:55.550 --> 07:56.949
- Picture?
- Picture.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.419
- Our picture's in there? What?
- Yeah.

07:59.910 --> 08:01.866
I cannot believe this.

08:02.030 --> 08:04.100
- There's George.
- Look at him.

08:04.270 --> 08:06.147
Oh, my God!
Lippman could see this!

08:06.310 --> 08:08.665
He thinks I was visiting my father.
Oh, my God!

08:08.830 --> 08:13.346
I make up one little white lie,
and they put my picture in the paper!

08:15.510 --> 08:16.863
Hi, Mr. Lippman.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.628
How's your father?

08:21.910 --> 08:23.582
My... My father.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.059
Yeah. You went to see him, right?

08:26.230 --> 08:27.822
Yeah.

08:27.990 --> 08:30.345
- I went to visit him.
- So...

08:30.510 --> 08:34.503
...what was wrong with him?
- Well, you name it. You know...

08:36.070 --> 08:39.221
Neuritis, neuralgia.

08:40.390 --> 08:42.823
But he's feeling better now, right?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.867
Yes. Yeah. It's such a miracle.

08:45.030 --> 08:47.749
You know, my visit must have
buoyed his spirits.

08:48.710 --> 08:49.984
Buoyed.

08:51.350 --> 08:53.022
- What did I say?
- You said "boy'd."

08:53.470 --> 08:55.586
- I did?
- Yeah.

09:06.310 --> 09:07.584
Well, I got a plane to catch.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.105
- Where are you going?
- Going to Houston for a few days.

09:10.270 --> 09:11.908
Publishers' convention.

09:12.350 --> 09:13.669
Can I have my sports section?

09:16.310 --> 09:18.062
- Oh, yeah.
- Sports section.

09:18.230 --> 09:21.142
I'm saving it for the plane. I never
miss the Sunday sports section.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.585
There's nothing to read.
It's yesterday's news.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.548
The Yankees won, the Mets lost,
Rickey Henderson's unhappy.

09:26.710 --> 09:28.223
Right. Right.

09:28.390 --> 09:30.620
What are you doing?

09:31.910 --> 09:35.300
That is the third time today
I have done that.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.539
I keep, you know, grabbing
newspapers and just tugging at them.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.302
Well, I gotta go.

09:42.470 --> 09:45.667
Okay. Yes, well, you know,
have a nice trip.

09:45.990 --> 09:50.427
Alrighty. I'll just
hold down the fort.

09:54.950 --> 09:58.022
I sense great vulnerability...

09:58.190 --> 10:00.226
...a man-child crying out for love...

10:00.390 --> 10:04.383
...an innocent orphan
in the postmodern world.

10:04.550 --> 10:06.620
I see a parasite.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.618
A sexually depraved miscreant...

10:10.790 --> 10:16.148
...who is seeking only to gratify his
basest and most immediate urges.

10:18.430 --> 10:19.749
She was a guest of my father's.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.265
- She should've taken the cap off.
- It's preposterous...

10:22.430 --> 10:25.388
...to ask someone to take off a
baseball cap at a baseball game.

10:25.550 --> 10:26.778
How can you defend that?

10:26.950 --> 10:29.623
His struggle is man's struggle.

10:29.790 --> 10:31.906
He lifts my spirit.

10:32.070 --> 10:35.028
He is a loathsome, offensive brute.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.780
Yet I can't look away.

10:39.990 --> 10:41.708
Look, I'm tired of all this fighting.

10:41.870 --> 10:45.146
Maybe we should end this before
we really start hating each other.

10:45.310 --> 10:48.939
You wouldn't want that, because you
always have to remain friends.

10:49.110 --> 10:52.386
I like to remain friends
with people I was friends with.

10:53.430 --> 10:55.944
Hey, why don't you just go then?

10:56.110 --> 11:00.069
And give this to George.
Tell him he owes me $500.

11:01.510 --> 11:04.786
He transcends time and space.

11:05.670 --> 11:08.059
He sickens me.

11:09.510 --> 11:12.229
I love it.

11:12.550 --> 11:14.620
Me too.

11:17.590 --> 11:19.501
Five hundred dollars?

11:19.790 --> 11:22.145
- What?
- That's what she told me.

11:22.710 --> 11:24.860
I'm not paying $500 for this!

11:25.030 --> 11:26.429
It's a piece of junk!

11:27.070 --> 11:28.981
- That's what it costs.
- Why did you take it?

11:29.150 --> 11:32.222
- You broke up with her.
- I wasn't thinking. I don't know.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.665
You weren't thinking.

11:36.910 --> 11:38.628
I mean, she framed it
and everything.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.621
I'm not buying this.
No way. Forget it.

11:40.790 --> 11:42.143
No way I'm buying this.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.540
I mean, look at it! What is it?

11:44.750 --> 11:47.264
It's a bunch of squiggly lines.

11:47.430 --> 11:49.182
Are you telling me you
couldn't paint this?

11:49.350 --> 11:52.786
You want me to paint you something?
I'd love to paint you something.

11:53.510 --> 11:54.738
I'm not paying for this.

11:54.910 --> 11:57.663
If you were going out with her,
it'd be a different story.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.702
This was in front of your door.

12:00.870 --> 12:02.303
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hi, Mike.

12:05.830 --> 12:07.263
Wow, a letter from Nina!

12:08.230 --> 12:11.825
Man, that is the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

12:13.270 --> 12:15.261
- Oh, my God.
- What?

12:15.430 --> 12:17.660
This is amazing.
You can't believe this.

12:17.830 --> 12:20.822
Listen to this. " I don't know what
you expect to find, Jerry.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.221
You know what you want better than
me, but there's one thing I do know.

12:24.390 --> 12:26.460
I can stand here watching
you try to destroy...

12:26.630 --> 12:28.621
...everything I've ever
wanted in my life...

12:28.790 --> 12:32.863
...wanting to smash your face with my
fists because you won't even make...

12:33.030 --> 12:36.340
...the slightest effort to opt for
happiness and still know I love you.

12:36.510 --> 12:38.944
You mean so much to me,
I'm willing to take your abuse...

12:39.110 --> 12:40.463
...insults and insensitivity."

12:40.630 --> 12:42.939
- Wow.
- She's deep.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.227
"Because that's what you need to
do to prove I'm not gonna leave you.

12:47.390 --> 12:50.427
I'm sick and tired of running from
places and people and relationships.

12:50.590 --> 12:52.979
You want me,
then fight for me, beca...

12:55.110 --> 12:57.499
Because I'm sure as hell
fighting for you.

12:58.630 --> 13:00.063
I think we're both worth it."

13:09.470 --> 13:11.267
You know, Jerry,
she sounds like a poet.

13:11.430 --> 13:13.864
Boy, no one's ever written me
a letter like this.

13:14.030 --> 13:15.827
Maybe I was wrong about her.

13:15.990 --> 13:18.788
Get in there and give her a call.
Pick up the phone and call her.

13:18.950 --> 13:22.147
- Should I?
- Yes, you're damn right you should!

13:22.350 --> 13:24.864
Fight for her, Jerry!
She's sure the hell fighting for you!

13:25.030 --> 13:26.349
All right!

13:27.390 --> 13:29.506
I'll call her.

13:44.030 --> 13:46.305
Don't go in there.
You're gonna get shot.

13:47.110 --> 13:48.941
I told you.

13:51.630 --> 13:52.983
- Yeah.
- It's George.

13:53.150 --> 13:54.629
Come on up.

13:55.870 --> 13:59.101
Well, now we gotta get
a posse together.

13:59.710 --> 14:01.063
I love a good posse.

14:02.590 --> 14:04.148
What's the appeal of the posse?

14:04.310 --> 14:05.629
The appeal of the posse?

14:05.790 --> 14:07.667
Posse has tremendous appeal.

14:07.830 --> 14:11.459
Get away from the job, you camp out,
you're with friends.

14:13.350 --> 14:16.740
Come on, it's a week-long game of
hide and go seek on horseback.

14:18.790 --> 14:20.018
Hello, George.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.987
Hey. Hey, Nina.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.827
I owe you some money, don't I?

14:26.990 --> 14:32.428
- Well, I really love that piece.
- Me too. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

14:32.590 --> 14:35.741
You know, in fact, I've been
thinking about it, and...

14:35.910 --> 14:38.299
...you know, I feel like
I'm stealing from you.

14:38.470 --> 14:41.826
Five hundred dollars! This is
gonna be worth thousands soon.

14:42.070 --> 14:45.107
You know what? On second thought,
I can't even accept this.

14:45.270 --> 14:49.058
No, no, no. George, a deal's a deal.
I want you to have it.

14:49.830 --> 14:52.298
This could be in a museum someday.
It's not safe with me.

14:52.470 --> 14:55.223
It should really be
in a doorman building.

14:55.390 --> 14:57.824
Honestly, George,
the money's not important.

14:57.990 --> 14:59.662
Who said anything about money?

15:01.750 --> 15:03.024
- Yeah.
- It's Elaine.

15:03.190 --> 15:04.384
Come on up.

15:04.550 --> 15:06.063
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

15:06.950 --> 15:09.020
She does not believe in telephones,
does she?

15:09.190 --> 15:12.739
She likes the pop-in.
I've told her how I hate the pop-in.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.389
He likes the pop-in too.

15:14.550 --> 15:16.984
Just popped in now.
I'm a big pop-in guy.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.061
- He is.
- What about Kramer?

15:19.230 --> 15:21.460
Huge pop-in guy.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.823
Well, I was leaving anyway.
So we're on for tomorrow?

15:25.990 --> 15:28.299
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

15:30.070 --> 15:31.662
Hello.

15:33.150 --> 15:35.141
Chatty gal.

15:36.590 --> 15:38.945
Lippman's coming back tomorrow.
I'll be fired.

15:39.110 --> 15:41.021
If he noticed it,
he would have called you.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.579
No. He wants to torture me.

15:44.390 --> 15:45.903
Will you give me the clicker?

15:46.070 --> 15:48.538
I hate it when you have the clicker.
You're too fast.

15:48.710 --> 15:51.622
Get out!
I'm a great clicker.

15:52.430 --> 15:53.783
I have great instincts.

15:53.950 --> 15:56.020
How dare you impugn my clicking.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.699
You're all over the dial.
You don't know what you want.

15:58.870 --> 16:02.101
You never stay on anything longer
than five seconds. Just give me that.

16:02.270 --> 16:04.101
- Let go.
- Come on. I want it, Jerry!

16:04.270 --> 16:06.101
- Let go, Elaine!
- Then let George do it!

16:06.270 --> 16:07.988
- George can't click!
- Give it to me!

16:08.150 --> 16:10.061
Give it! Give it! Give it!

16:10.230 --> 16:11.902
Pinheads.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.382
Maybe I can't...

16:15.190 --> 16:18.739
...analyse and theorize and...

16:18.910 --> 16:21.344
...speculate on why we...

16:21.510 --> 16:23.546
Wait a second. Go back to that.
Go back to that.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.661
Hey, you read all those books,
not me.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.422
It's Chapter Two.
It's Neil Simon.

16:27.590 --> 16:29.706
But one thing I do know.

16:29.870 --> 16:31.667
I know how I feel.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.621
Wait a second.
Wait a second!

16:34.790 --> 16:37.668
- What?
- My God. The letter. That's the letter!

16:38.030 --> 16:40.305
- What letter?
- This is the letter she wrote to me.

16:40.470 --> 16:42.426
She stole it from the movie!

16:42.590 --> 16:43.909
Because you don't even mak e...

16:44.070 --> 16:46.789
"The slightest effort
to opt for happiness...

16:46.950 --> 16:50.340
...and still know that I love you!"

16:50.550 --> 16:52.620
This is incredible.

16:52.790 --> 16:56.385
I always thought there was something
funny about this letter.

16:56.550 --> 16:58.302
She's copied it right out of
Chapter Two.

16:58.470 --> 17:00.381
She's a thief! A bunco artist.

17:00.550 --> 17:02.859
Maybe I won't send her that check.

17:06.310 --> 17:08.869
You know, it's not really that terrible.

17:09.030 --> 17:12.339
What are you talking about? She
completely misrepresented herself.

17:12.510 --> 17:15.422
I don't opt for happiness.
I opt for happiness.

17:15.589 --> 17:18.262
James Caan doesn't
opt for happiness.

17:21.270 --> 17:22.464
Yeah. Yeah.

17:22.670 --> 17:24.547
She wouldn't take the cap off?

17:25.190 --> 17:29.342
No. But didn't she know they
were the owner's seats?

17:29.510 --> 17:32.070
Oh, that's unbelievable.

17:32.230 --> 17:34.824
Yeah, okay. All right, Lenny.

17:34.990 --> 17:36.343
Thanks again.

17:36.510 --> 17:38.228
Take care.

17:39.190 --> 17:42.944
That's Lenny West, my accountant,
who's a hell of a guy.

17:43.110 --> 17:45.499
He handles the Yankees too.
It's his biggest account.

17:47.310 --> 17:49.904
So every once in a while,
they throw him a couple of seats...

17:50.070 --> 17:53.346
...and last weekend,
he gave them to his daughter.

17:53.670 --> 17:56.389
She's an artist, by the way.
Anyway...

17:56.550 --> 17:59.223
...her daughter gives them
to some friends, you know?

17:59.390 --> 18:01.620
One of her friends shows up...

18:01.790 --> 18:03.860
...wearing a Baltimore cap.

18:05.430 --> 18:07.261
You're from Baltimore, right?

18:09.030 --> 18:11.419
It's Towson.
That's near Baltimore.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.342
But you're an Oriole fan, right?

18:13.510 --> 18:15.899
Well, fan...
You know, my father...

18:16.070 --> 18:19.062
Anyway, she refused
to take the cap off.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.709
She caused a whole big scene.

18:20.950 --> 18:22.941
Really? That's so impudent.

18:23.110 --> 18:26.625
Yeah. So Lenny gave me
the tickets for tomorrow night.

18:26.790 --> 18:29.827
I'm inviting Frank and Marsha.
Want you to come.

18:34.390 --> 18:36.062
I've got plans, though, Mr. Lippman.

18:36.230 --> 18:37.663
Well, break them.

18:38.270 --> 18:40.340
You missed the bris.
I want you at the game.

18:42.470 --> 18:44.700
Okay. Okay.

18:44.870 --> 18:47.259
- Good.
- Okay, Mr. Lippman.

18:49.630 --> 18:53.100
And, Elaine, you know the Baltimore
cap you got in your office...

18:53.270 --> 18:55.830
...wear it. I'm gonna have
a little fun with him.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.306
That will be fun.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.984
How's it coming?

19:05.510 --> 19:07.102
Good. Good.

19:09.030 --> 19:10.941
Seen any good movies lately?

19:12.870 --> 19:14.223
No. Not really.

19:14.390 --> 19:16.745
- You?
- No.

19:16.910 --> 19:19.026
I like a good comedy.

19:19.190 --> 19:21.750
You know, like a Neil Simon.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.788
- You like Neil Simon?
- Neil Simon?

19:25.110 --> 19:26.509
Some of his stuff.

19:26.670 --> 19:28.501
I've seen most of it.

19:28.670 --> 19:31.503
I guess my favourite
would have to be...

19:31.670 --> 19:33.581
...Chapter Two.

19:35.070 --> 19:36.549
Have you ever seen that?

19:38.390 --> 19:40.381
I don't know. Maybe.

19:40.870 --> 19:42.098
I have.

19:42.870 --> 19:45.179
Funny. Funny.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.341
In fact, it was on TV
just the other night.

19:47.510 --> 19:49.182
Happened to catch it.

19:49.350 --> 19:52.581
I couldn't help but notice...

19:52.750 --> 19:54.945
...a stunning similarity...

19:55.110 --> 19:56.907
Well, we've made our decision.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.742
We want the Kramer.

20:00.550 --> 20:05.578
Five thousand? Why would anybody
buy Kramer for $5000?

20:07.870 --> 20:10.589
Boy, the Yankees cannot
buy a hit tonight.

20:11.430 --> 20:14.945
So is it all over between you
and Marsha Mason?

20:15.990 --> 20:17.264
Yeah.

20:17.510 --> 20:20.388
And by the way, can you get
this thing out of my house?

20:20.550 --> 20:22.029
I'll make a deal with you.

20:22.190 --> 20:25.023
- I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks.
- Please.

20:25.190 --> 20:30.264
Seems to be a lot of trouble in the
area just behind the Yank ee dugout.

20:30.710 --> 20:33.429
Behind the dugout? That's where
we were sitting the other night.

20:33.590 --> 20:36.741
We're not gonna show it, don't want
to encourage that kind of behaviour.

20:36.910 --> 20:40.539
It's a young lady, and she's really
going at it with the security guard.

20:40.710 --> 20:44.305
She's a feisty one. They're getting the
other security guard to come down.

20:44.470 --> 20:45.698
How do you lik e that, Seaver?

20:45.870 --> 20:48.304
And, boy, she's something,
and a Baltimore fan at that.

20:48.470 --> 20:50.540
Holy cow!

20:53.350 --> 20:59.266
When I was 17, I ran away from home
and hopped a steamship to Sweden.

21:00.990 --> 21:03.629
- This steak is excellent, by the way.
- More potatoes?

21:03.790 --> 21:05.223
Yeah, yeah, sure. Please.

21:05.390 --> 21:09.508
Yes, yes, go on. You hopped
a steamship to Sweden?

21:12.110 --> 21:13.668
It was a big one.

21:13.830 --> 21:16.503
Baseball season's starting.
I'm very excited about that.

21:16.670 --> 21:19.423
Did you ever sneak down
to better seats at the game...

21:19.590 --> 21:21.308
...and get caught by the usher?

21:21.470 --> 21:24.621
When you're a kid, you're getting
chased from every place anyway.

21:24.790 --> 21:27.099
When you're an adult,
it's really embarrassing.

21:27.270 --> 21:30.182
You have to pretend like there's
some confusion.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.748
You put on this whole act.
You're looking at the tickets.

21:33.910 --> 21:36.868
"I don't understand how this
could have happened.

21:37.030 --> 21:38.861
Let me see. I see the problem.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.988
These are very good seats.
I have very bad seats.

21:42.150 --> 21:44.618
That's the misunderstanding."
