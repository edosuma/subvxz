Seven-year-old girl,
severe abdominal pain,

03:58.297 --> 03:59.796
nausea, vomiting.

Slightly hypertensive. 400cc's

We wouldn't have brought her in

we didn't know what to do.

04:07.063 --> 04:08.396
Uh, Dr. Bell is our doctor.

Maybe, but we'll admit her

04:35.501 --> 04:37.300

this is happening.

Sammie has a history

10:12.095 --> 10:14.529
I was out for a beat,
but Piper's hurt real bad.

10:18.768 --> 10:21.361
Her leg is trapped under
the wall; I couldn't free her.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.013
-Piper, I got help.
-NIC: This isn't good.

10:24.107 --> 10:26.958
Hey, Wes, we need a tourniquet,
an IV kit and some fluids.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.609
All right?

10:28.629 --> 10:30.444
Weak radial pulse.

10:30.464 --> 10:34.115
-Anything else hurt?
-Just my leg.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.860
CONRAD:
She's going
into hemorrhagic shock.

10:36.878 --> 10:38.803
She can't afford to lose
any more blood.

10:38.955 --> 10:42.474
-Tourniquet.
-WES: You are gonna be fine.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.033
Worst-case scenario,
you get some well-deserved

10:44.127 --> 10:45.218
time off with pay.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.371
Wes can find the upside
to anything.

10:48.464 --> 10:50.464
It's nauseating.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.543
I could use a little time
away from you, Pollyanna.

10:53.561 --> 10:54.986
I mean, you guys
have been working together

10:55.138 --> 10:56.696
for about a decade now.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.232
(shouts)

10:59.384 --> 11:01.284
-(Piper shouts)
-(Conrad grunts)

11:02.496 --> 11:04.570
Tourniquet's on,
but it's not stopping the bleed.

11:04.723 --> 11:05.722
NIC:
We've done everything
we can out here.

11:05.740 --> 11:07.499
We need to get her inside.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.984
Wes, give me a hand?

11:10.003 --> 11:13.588
Help me get this thing
off of her. (grunting)

11:18.753 --> 11:20.553
(sirens wailing)

11:22.849 --> 11:27.427
(wind whistling)

11:27.579 --> 11:30.730
Damn it, the cell service
is still down.

11:31.674 --> 11:33.024
He's having a seizure.

11:38.924 --> 11:41.324
We need Cain or he's gonna die.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.329
Ugh...

11:48.934 --> 11:49.874
(grunts)

11:50.026 --> 11:51.617
Damn it.

11:51.770 --> 11:53.503
(panting)

11:57.125 --> 11:58.291
We should reduce the fracture.

11:58.443 --> 11:59.792
That might buy us
some more time.

11:59.945 --> 12:02.779
-Wes, you ready?
-You are now officially

12:02.872 --> 12:04.280
the most needy patient
I've ever had.

12:04.299 --> 12:08.876
Mm. Last thing
I wanted to do is die needy.

12:08.970 --> 12:10.979
Not gonna happen, Pipe.

12:12.123 --> 12:13.565
NIC:
All right, you ready?

12:15.384 --> 12:18.294
Okay. One,

12:18.313 --> 12:20.989
two...

12:22.801 --> 12:25.392
(screams)

12:25.412 --> 12:27.078
(gasping)

12:28.397 --> 12:31.124
It's better,
but she's losing a lot of blood.

12:32.401 --> 12:36.145
Guys, I-I don't feel so good.

12:36.164 --> 12:37.480
NIC:
We lost the pulse.

12:37.573 --> 12:39.073
Grab the defibrillator.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.666
NIC:
Starting compressions.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.077
CONRAD:
We have to amputate
her leg before she bleeds out.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.821
Wes, have someone page Dr. Voss.

12:44.839 --> 12:46.598
We need her now.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.467
Damage could've been much worse.

12:49.694 --> 12:51.770
Guess only one side
of the hospital got hit.

12:51.997 --> 12:53.012
Tell me about the patient.

12:54.332 --> 12:56.608
I got a ridiculous consult
about a woman with sickle cell

12:56.759 --> 13:00.853
who's here for myeloablative
chemo prior to gene therapy.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.188
Rose Williams?

13:02.340 --> 13:03.615
Yeah. How do you know her?

13:03.842 --> 13:06.725
-What happened?
-She fell and bonked her head.

13:06.878 --> 13:08.119
I told them maybe don't call

13:08.271 --> 13:10.104
unless there's an actual
neurosurgical problem, but...

13:10.123 --> 13:12.865
No. We'll see her.

13:13.018 --> 13:15.368
<i> WOMAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i> Dr. Ward,</i>
<i> please come to admitting</i>

13:15.462 --> 13:17.587
<i> for a new patient assessment.</i>

13:19.524 --> 13:21.207
Rose.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.528
This is Dr. Sutton, my resident.

13:25.621 --> 13:26.696
Tell us what happened.

13:26.714 --> 13:28.714
(laughs):
Oh, it's so stupid.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.200
I fell in the bathroom
and hit my head.

13:31.261 --> 13:32.885
I'm sure I'm fine.

13:33.038 --> 13:35.021
Okay, well, we'll just see.

13:37.633 --> 13:38.875
(electrical buzzing)

13:38.893 --> 13:40.610
Full power's back on.

13:42.714 --> 13:44.230
I see you started chemo.

13:44.382 --> 13:45.657
Yeah. They're blasting my marrow

13:45.884 --> 13:48.234
and preparing me
for gene therapy.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.644
I knew it'd be tough, but...

13:50.664 --> 13:52.388
(exhales)

13:52.407 --> 13:53.814
...this is really doing
a number on me.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.392
Well, if anyone
can handle it, it's you.

13:56.411 --> 13:58.002
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

13:58.154 --> 14:00.088
Can you follow my finger?

14:03.401 --> 14:06.052
I haven't seen you
since Waylon's.

14:07.663 --> 14:11.182
Yeah, I'm sorry, I've just been,
been really busy.

14:11.334 --> 14:12.925
Listen, given the effects
that the chemo

14:13.019 --> 14:16.354
is having on your bone marrow,
I want to get you a head CT.

14:16.505 --> 14:19.649
Dr. Sutton can finish the exam.

14:23.088 --> 14:25.755
-Squeeze my fingers, please?
-(quietly): Uh...

14:26.849 --> 14:30.109
So, Sammie's nose just started
bleeding on its own?

14:30.261 --> 14:32.036
Yeah, apparently,
it's been happening

14:32.263 --> 14:35.281
-like this a lot lately.
-Okay, just...

14:35.433 --> 14:38.618
All right, just let me know
if this hurts, okay?

14:38.712 --> 14:41.546
Oh, I'm sorry, she might
not have understood you.

14:41.697 --> 14:43.530
We've only had her six months,
and, uh, she hasn't really

14:43.625 --> 14:46.200
picked up English
as quickly as we'd hoped.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.678
(laughs softly)
It's a big adjustment.

15:02.402 --> 15:06.237
Um, what happened
to her biological parents?

15:06.389 --> 15:07.313
GRETCHEN:
Uh, we-we didn't ask.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.315
Well, they didn't tell us. We...

15:09.409 --> 15:11.467
We were just so thrilled
there was a healthy little girl

15:11.560 --> 15:13.761
waiting for us, and...

15:13.763 --> 15:15.304
the first moment we met her,

15:15.323 --> 15:17.081
-we fell in love with her.
-KEN: She passed out

15:17.308 --> 15:18.641
a couple of days
after we got her home.

15:18.734 --> 15:20.401
We took her to the ER
and found out

15:20.495 --> 15:23.570
she had tumors
everywhere in her body.

15:23.665 --> 15:25.815
GRETCHEN:
They told us to take her home,
make her comfortable

15:25.833 --> 15:28.092
-for her last few months.
-That's when we found Dr. Bell,

15:28.319 --> 15:31.154
and he said he could treat her.

15:31.247 --> 15:32.597
BELL:
Well, I-I said

15:32.824 --> 15:35.582
I might be able to perform
a very risky surgery

15:35.602 --> 15:37.435
that's only been done
a few times before.

15:37.586 --> 15:40.163
There's, uh, t-there's a lot
we need to go over

15:40.256 --> 15:41.439
-before we proceed.
-Yeah, uh,

15:41.590 --> 15:43.683
this is more than just
an ordinary nosebleed.

15:43.835 --> 15:45.777
-BELL: Yeah, I thought so.
-Sammie?
-KEN: Oh, my God.

15:45.928 --> 15:48.655
-Sammie, baby, are you okay?
-You okay?

15:56.272 --> 15:57.513
It's a bit cramped.

15:57.532 --> 15:59.015
I've amputated limbs

15:59.108 --> 16:01.542
-under worse circumstances.
-All right.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.128
Please, save her.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.464
We're gonna do
everything we can.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.105
(saw rasping)

16:33.067 --> 16:34.659
KIT:
Saline.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.667
One, two, three.
Let's go. Yep, yep.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.743
<i> WOMAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i> Code Yellow. All visitors,</i>

17:00.836 --> 17:02.002

17:02.022 --> 17:04.022
<i> Do not attempt to leave</i>
<i> the hospital.</i>

17:04.173 --> 17:07.483
Dude, sorry about Mina.

17:08.177 --> 17:09.418
Must be rough.

17:09.512 --> 17:10.586
How you holding up?

17:10.679 --> 17:12.679
On the bright side,
maybe we can go get

17:12.699 --> 17:14.365
that drink we were talking
about getting, you know?

17:14.592 --> 17:15.441
Do some sharing.

17:15.593 --> 17:18.536
Go on about your business,
Nolan.

17:20.098 --> 17:22.206
Yep-- That thing? Okay.

17:22.433 --> 17:25.209
Yeah, I feel you, man.
I have had it up to here

17:25.436 --> 17:27.436
with the sad looks from people

17:27.455 --> 17:29.438
about losing the baby
we were gonna adopt.

17:29.532 --> 17:30.606
I loathe pity.

17:30.699 --> 17:32.441
-Yeah, me, too.
-BELL: Look, I'm thinking

17:32.460 --> 17:34.126
you can both use a distraction.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.704
This is imaging of my
seven-year-old patient Sammie.

17:37.799 --> 17:40.874
Tumor in the pancreas
wrapped around the stomach,

17:40.894 --> 17:43.544
liver, spleen,
large and small intestines.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.229
This is inoperable.

17:45.381 --> 17:46.880
It's an inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumor.

17:46.900 --> 17:47.973
It's a death sentence.

17:48.126 --> 17:51.811
Unless we can tag you in.

17:51.963 --> 17:53.905
Are you talking
auto-transplantation?

17:54.056 --> 17:56.132
Pioneered by
the legendary Dr. Kato

17:56.150 --> 17:57.724
at Columbia Presbyterian.

17:57.819 --> 18:00.578
You want to take out
all of her abdominal organs,

18:00.805 --> 18:03.823
extract the tumors and then
put the organs back in her body?

18:03.917 --> 18:06.325
Yeah, this is
the highest-risk surgery

18:06.419 --> 18:07.901
any of us will ever perform.

18:07.995 --> 18:09.161
And I-I wanted to wait,

18:09.314 --> 18:11.981
but the tumors have occluded

18:11.999 --> 18:13.240
the spleno-mesenteric junction.

18:13.334 --> 18:15.167
Her liver is failing,
clotting factors are low

18:15.320 --> 18:16.502
and she's bleeding
uncontrollably.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.246
That means she has
to have the surgery today.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.932
We're the only chance she's got.

18:21.935 --> 18:25.561
Well, say no more.
Let's go save a life.

18:34.930 --> 18:36.405
She likes you.

18:37.175 --> 18:39.325
She seems lovely.

18:40.027 --> 18:41.177
You like her?

18:41.195 --> 18:42.620
I'm only asking

18:42.771 --> 18:44.288
because she couldn't
take her eyes off you,

18:44.440 --> 18:47.083
and you couldn't bolt
out of there fast enough.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.779
Geez. Patients fall
for their doctors all the time,

18:52.799 --> 18:54.281
and vice versa.
What's the big deal?

18:54.375 --> 18:57.376
First off, she's not
actually my patient.

18:57.528 --> 19:00.471
Second, mind your own business.

19:00.698 --> 19:02.473
When you tell someone
to mind their own business,

19:02.625 --> 19:05.792
it just confirms what it is
you don't want them to think.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.053
How I feel about Rose,
and how I choose

19:08.206 --> 19:10.130
to interact with her
is not something

19:10.224 --> 19:12.558
I need to explain to a resident.

19:12.710 --> 19:15.987
Mind your business.

19:21.569 --> 19:23.235
(computer beeping)

19:23.329 --> 19:26.389
I don't see anything. You?

19:26.482 --> 19:28.073
No bleeds.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.834
We'll need to monitor her.

19:30.061 --> 19:32.003
(phone buzzing)

19:32.897 --> 19:34.988
<i> DEVON:</i>
<i> Dr. Cain?</i>

19:35.082 --> 19:37.733
Thank God. I'm with Dr. Devi
in the sim lab.

19:37.826 --> 19:40.494
We're trapped with a patient who
has a penetrating head trauma.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.513
He's status
post-grand mal seizure

19:42.665 --> 19:45.090
and he's decompensating.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.759
I just sent you a photo.

19:46.911 --> 19:49.002
BILLIE:
Okay, by the locations,

19:49.022 --> 19:50.413
my money's on
an epidural hematoma

19:50.431 --> 19:52.339
with middle meningeal
artery laceration.

19:52.433 --> 19:55.193
You need to get him
to an OR immediately.

19:55.344 --> 19:57.420
There's significant debris from
the tornado blocking the door.

19:57.513 --> 19:59.697
<i> -We won't be able to get out.</i>
-(pager beeping)

20:00.942 --> 20:02.182
BILLIE:
From Kit. ER's overwhelmed.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.609
I-I got to get down there.

20:03.761 --> 20:07.038
I'll have a crew send someone
to free them, okay?

20:07.189 --> 20:09.540
Dr. Devi, you are
a surgical intern.

20:09.767 --> 20:10.875
I need you to start cutting now.

20:11.026 --> 20:12.710
<i> -This can't wait.</i>
-Here in the sim lab?

20:12.861 --> 20:16.439
<i> Yes. Find any type of surgical</i>
<i> equipment that you can use.</i>

20:16.532 --> 20:19.275
<i> What's the status</i>
<i> on the patient?</i>

20:19.293 --> 20:21.535
He's unresponsive
to painful stimuli.

20:21.629 --> 20:24.388
<i> What else have you got,</i>
<i> equipment-wise?</i>

20:28.728 --> 20:30.561
Sutures and gloves.
Scalpels and surgical equipment

20:30.713 --> 20:32.955
are in the cabinet
but we can't get to it.

20:32.974 --> 20:34.623
Okay, listen to me,
you cannot do this

20:34.642 --> 20:36.383
<i> -without the right tools.</i>
-We do have sheets

20:36.402 --> 20:38.127
-and pillowcases.
<i> -Okay, great.</i>

20:38.145 --> 20:39.052
Great, great.
Lay those around the patient.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.905
<i> How about sterilization?</i>

20:41.056 --> 20:42.556
-Hand sanitizer.
<i> -Okay.</i>

20:42.650 --> 20:45.134
So here's the deal.
If you remove that rod,

20:45.227 --> 20:46.485
he could die of exsanguination.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.321
<i> If you don't,</i>
<i> he can die of herniation.</i>

20:49.415 --> 20:52.083
I want to do whatever gives him
the best shot at survival.

20:52.310 --> 20:53.417
Just tell us what to do,
Dr. Cain.

20:53.569 --> 20:55.402
And speak fast
before we lose you.

20:55.496 --> 20:57.496
Okay, remove that rod.
But then you'll need to remove

20:57.648 --> 20:59.924
a section of the skull around
the impalement. Do you have

21:00.075 --> 21:01.634
<i> anything else</i>
<i> in that room that you can use?</i>

21:02.987 --> 21:04.345
We have a toolbox.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.557
-(whirs)
-Power drill.

21:09.494 --> 21:12.019

21:13.422 --> 21:14.830
X-Acto.

21:14.923 --> 21:16.757
<i> Okay, that's not ideal,</i>
<i> but it's gonna have to work.</i>

21:16.851 --> 21:18.592
<i> Once you take out that rod,</i>

21:18.686 --> 21:20.519
<i> you have to stop the bleeding</i>
<i> inside the cranial vault.</i>

21:20.613 --> 21:23.114
Fingers crossed that
that artery's still intact.

21:23.265 --> 21:25.007
Then you're gonna remove

21:25.026 --> 21:26.191
<i> all of those bone fragments.</i>

21:26.286 --> 21:27.601
<i> (distorted):</i>
<i> You have to be very...</i>

21:27.695 --> 21:29.412
-(phone beeps)
-Dr. Cain.

21:30.181 --> 21:33.332
Damn it. We lost him.

21:34.519 --> 21:36.585
We're on our own.

21:39.707 --> 21:42.091
<i> (indistinct P.A. announcement)</i>

21:48.290 --> 21:50.866
Hi. Hey, uh, why don't you go

21:50.885 --> 21:52.810
scrub and I'll catch up.

21:53.037 --> 21:55.646
Okay.

22:17.061 --> 22:18.627
Hmm?

22:46.757 --> 22:48.699
Okay.

22:49.351 --> 22:50.442
It has to be you.

22:50.595 --> 22:52.352
I haven't been in surgery
since med school.

22:52.479 --> 22:54.538
(nearby banging)

22:54.765 --> 22:56.207
Hey, can you hear me?

22:56.358 --> 22:57.766
WORKER:
Whole wall's collapsed.

22:57.785 --> 22:59.210
At least an hour, maybe more.

22:59.361 --> 23:01.462
Oh, God.

23:04.199 --> 23:05.883
Listen, I know you're scared,

23:06.034 --> 23:07.276
but you have to do this now.

23:07.369 --> 23:09.136
I'm not scared of anything.

23:10.297 --> 23:12.464
But rushing me won't help.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.116
Leela, what's happening?

23:14.118 --> 23:15.634
Tell me what to do, come on.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.803
My brain needs more time
to process one new thing

23:17.897 --> 23:21.148
and this is... many.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.809
Okay.

23:23.961 --> 23:26.737
Visualize a quadrant
around the rod.

23:28.649 --> 23:31.617
Imagine drilling a hole
in all four corners.

23:32.653 --> 23:34.820
And then we cut open the bone.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.822
We get underneath it.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.474
And...

23:38.492 --> 23:41.419
Extract the rod
and stop the bleeding.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.010
(drill whirs)

23:52.339 --> 23:55.057

24:05.002 --> 24:06.777
AUSTIN:
Vascular clamping complete.

24:06.929 --> 24:08.696
BELL:
Yeah, let's remove the organs.

24:14.528 --> 24:16.937
I know as a surgeon,
we're supposed to play it cool.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.456
But this is insane.

24:18.607 --> 24:21.125
Yeah, the clock is ticking.
Let's resect

24:21.276 --> 24:23.109
the tumors on the back table,
then...

24:23.204 --> 24:25.370
get the organs
back inside her body.

24:25.523 --> 24:28.757
I'll begin
the portal vein reconstruction.

24:33.047 --> 24:35.306
Dr. Austin, are you okay?

24:36.625 --> 24:40.202
What about me suggests
that I'm not okay, Jessica?

24:40.963 --> 24:44.556
Am I not elbow deep
in a child's abdominal cavity

24:44.709 --> 24:46.734
doing the work of gods?

24:49.063 --> 24:51.471
Am I sad? Yes.

24:51.491 --> 24:54.808
Do I feel as empty
as this poor child?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.160
Yes.

24:56.353 --> 24:58.387
Do I need people
constantly reminding me

24:58.405 --> 25:01.982
that I've been mortally wounded
by the loss of love?

25:02.001 --> 25:04.376
No!

25:09.400 --> 25:10.899
Uh...

25:10.993 --> 25:13.235
my bad, Jessica.

25:13.328 --> 25:15.679
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm fine.

25:15.831 --> 25:16.680
Okay. Bovie?

25:16.907 --> 25:18.974
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:22.596 --> 25:24.188
(rapid beeping)

25:24.339 --> 25:26.190
Piper's blood pressure's
failing.

25:27.434 --> 25:29.268
-I think I see the source.
-I'll keep transfusing,

25:29.362 --> 25:30.844
but her body's starting
to shut down.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.322
She can't afford
to lose any more blood.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.349
There goes another one.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.018
We didn't amputate Piper's leg

25:38.037 --> 25:39.745
just to let her die
on the table.

25:41.523 --> 25:42.856
-She's going into V tach.
-(machines beeping)

25:42.950 --> 25:44.667
We need to speed this up.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.675
Okay, let's get the bar
out of his head.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.723
Steady hands.

25:59.875 --> 26:02.968
You move it even one millimeter
in the wrong direction,

26:03.062 --> 26:05.120
it could be catastrophic.

26:05.139 --> 26:06.730
Look, you got this.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.401
I'll hold his head.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.924
No major bleeding.

26:34.076 --> 26:36.652
Okay, now we have to remove

26:36.745 --> 26:39.722
the remaining bone fragments.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.161
BELL:
The tumors are resected.

26:46.180 --> 26:47.679
JAKE:
Yeah, we're running out of time.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.348
She needs these organs
re-implanted now.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.925
The bad news is
the tumors eviscerated

26:51.944 --> 26:53.611
her pancreas,
spleen and stomach.

26:53.762 --> 26:56.505
The good news is
we still have enough healthy

26:56.598 --> 26:58.190
liver and intestine.

26:58.342 --> 27:00.175
You ready for re-implantation?

27:00.194 --> 27:03.011
AUSTIN:
No. I just came across

27:03.030 --> 27:05.013
a smattering of malignant growth

27:05.032 --> 27:06.457
in her abdominal wall.

27:06.684 --> 27:08.608
They must've been
undetected on imaging.

27:08.628 --> 27:11.587
These are going to prevent us
from closing.

27:15.951 --> 27:17.209
Okay, we are gonna have
to rebuild her

27:17.303 --> 27:19.470
quickly from the inside out,
starting with

27:19.639 --> 27:21.788
the GI reconstruction, then
the abdominal reconstruction.

27:21.807 --> 27:25.392
It's a good thing we have
a plastic surgeon in our midst.

27:27.129 --> 27:29.438
Nice and slow.

27:32.042 --> 27:34.360
Okay.

27:36.138 --> 27:37.804
Let's do this.

27:38.732 --> 27:41.141
All right, I think
that's the last fragment.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.410
I don't see any more.

27:46.390 --> 27:48.666
Oh, it's the artery--
he's bleeding out.

27:48.817 --> 27:49.908
Apply pressure.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.060
It's not working. We need
something to seal it off.

27:52.154 --> 27:54.380
All right, I'll look.
Leela, keep applying pressure.

27:55.916 --> 27:58.250
Okay.

27:58.344 --> 28:01.053
The patient is
becoming unstable.

28:02.348 --> 28:05.407
The instability is related
to a bleeding vessel.

28:05.500 --> 28:08.185
We need to achieve homeostasis.

28:08.412 --> 28:11.838
We don't have clips or wax.

28:11.932 --> 28:14.149
What else?

28:16.086 --> 28:18.153
We need to burn it.

28:20.015 --> 28:21.848
We don't have electrocautery.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.409
Does he have a soldering iron?

28:27.765 --> 28:30.124
It might work. Give it a shot.

28:46.467 --> 28:48.517
You did it.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.563
Now let's hope
they get us out in time.

She saw the world as it is.

We were two halves of a piece

You'll always carry

31:14.707 --> 31:18.542
And she wouldn't want you
to stop helping people.

31:19.694 --> 31:21.269
And the last thing
she would want is to be

31:21.363 --> 31:23.505
an anchor around your neck.

31:25.109 --> 31:27.551

Dr. Chan is waiting.

32:18.345 --> 32:20.437
He had a bleed,

-Ever.
-Well, now you know
what it feels like

32:33.435 --> 32:35.010

32:35.028 --> 32:37.679
I have always been confident
