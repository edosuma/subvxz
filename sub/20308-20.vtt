WEBVTT

00:01.292 --> 00:07.173
(mumbling, groaning)

00:07.257 --> 00:09.259
No, no, no.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.720
Frank. Frank, it's all right.

00:13.513 --> 00:14.347
Huh?

00:17.517 --> 00:18.518
(sighs)

00:20.729 --> 00:21.688
I'm sorry.

00:25.984 --> 00:26.818
What is it?

00:29.654 --> 00:33.450
Somebody was going on a trip,
I didn't want them to go.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.374
Better not have been another woman.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.215
It was my dad.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.764
He was getting on a boat,
and I was upset he was leaving.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.768
There was something
we were supposed to do together.

01:04.981 --> 01:05.982
That's crazy.

01:07.108 --> 01:10.070
My father never went anywhere
away from home in his whole life.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.033
Maybe that's his dying.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.870
Young Dr. Freud.

01:22.874 --> 01:23.917
Come on, Furillo.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.129
Last 15 minutes are the best.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.384
No, I'm up.

01:39.682 --> 01:40.600
Six-thirty?

01:40.683 --> 01:41.559
Mm-hmm.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.694
I wonder what we were supposed to do.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.366
Oh.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.159
-Thanks, Bobby.
-Yeah.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.661
Hey, your guys' heater working?

02:00.078 --> 02:01.079
Rub your motor.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.790
Yeah, if I don't asphyxiate myself.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.046
No way these leggings last until 3:00.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.633
TINA: Well, you think third time's
a charm with this guy?

02:15.218 --> 02:16.970
Where did you say you got those fishnets?

02:17.720 --> 02:19.097
Ah, 21st Street shop.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.057
I'm red.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.309
MAN: Ooh, how 'bout a freebie, huh?

02:27.897 --> 02:28.731
Hi.

02:29.023 --> 02:29.858
Good morning.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.568
Parking practice?

02:31.776 --> 02:32.610
Yeah, right.

02:33.695 --> 02:34.612
You got 15 minutes?

02:35.488 --> 02:36.489
Fifteen minutes of what?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.992
I don't know, uh, spend time with a jerk?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.578
Now, mister,
I think you know why I'm out here.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.413
You here for the same thing?

02:44.747 --> 02:45.748
How much?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.375
Why don't you pull around the corner?

02:47.458 --> 02:49.878
-We'll talk about it there.
-All right.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.422
Eleven-fifteen a.m.,
defective heating unit.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.258
Sitting here with a wind chill factor
of God knows what.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.261
How would you like to be
standing on the corner in a miniskirt?

02:58.344 --> 02:59.679
Are you trying to make me feel guilty

02:59.762 --> 03:01.931
-by thinking about somebody else's misery?
-No, no, no.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.808
I'm just saying things could be worse.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.727
Things are sufficiently bad.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.228
I know.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.273
Hi-ho.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.650
A woman walking these streets,

03:12.734 --> 03:15.570
she's usually working for Jimmy,
Jimmy Shields.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.363
And now who might Jimmy Shields be?

03:17.864 --> 03:18.698
<i>Moi.</i>

03:20.116 --> 03:20.992
No kidding?

03:21.075 --> 03:23.703
Listen, I got to hold the 100
before I get in the car.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.372
Does this get me a half-and-half?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.126
I'm a police officer, mister.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.171
You're under arrest. Step out of the car.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.758
TINA (on radio): <i>This is Russo,</i>
<i>2201, I've got a collar.</i>

03:38.134 --> 03:39.636
Yeah, we'll pin a rose on you.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.806
I'll steer your trade and protect you.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.184
We split 60/40.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.896
That's the way it works
on the corner of Dekker and Jefferson.

03:49.979 --> 03:53.274
So is that a firm offer, Jimmy, huh?
You want me to trick for you?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.443
You bet.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.362
You're popped, get out of the car.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.363
"Popped," what's that mean?

03:58.446 --> 04:00.698
You're under arrest.
Get out of the car, come on.

04:01.157 --> 04:01.991
Come on!

04:02.408 --> 04:03.243
I can't--

04:03.493 --> 04:04.702
Hands up on it.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.247
-We were just rapping, sister.
-Yeah, right.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.165
Two-two-oh-two.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.083
BATES (on radio): <i>Got a pick-up.</i>

04:10.166 --> 04:11.084
Way to go, Sarge.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.628
Way to go, Lucille Bates,
now we can go inside.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.215
There's no way you can cut me
some rhythm on this one, huh?

04:17.298 --> 04:18.132
Afraid not.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.051
You know, you got a familiar-looking face.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.262
-Hey, where you going? Get back here!
-TINA: Hey!

04:22.345 --> 04:24.806
What's he gonna do,
leave the $30,000 car here?

04:24.889 --> 04:27.934
-TINA: Backup units, get over here--
-We'll call from the car, get in.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.894
I tell you, the chick's got it all wrong.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.021
It's just-- We were speaking
in the hypothetical.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.898
Well, this is a hypothetical bust.

04:33.982 --> 04:34.941
BOBBY: Renko, Renko!

04:38.152 --> 04:39.487
-Let's go!
-I got him.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.906
Shields, it's you and I
in the El Do, Jimmy, let's go.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.866
Maybe if you'd pulled your piece
we wouldn't be chasing him.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.286
-Yeah, right, soliciting bust?
-Yeah, right.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.203
Give me a break.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.624
I think I recognize this guy.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.636
Get off the fence!

05:03.720 --> 05:04.762
BOBBY: Hold it right there!

05:05.263 --> 05:07.598
You're under arrest. Come on down.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.478
Turn around.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.439
He almost cleared a 12-foot fence.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.690
There's a reason for that.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.026
I recognize this guy.
You know who this guy is?

05:18.109 --> 05:19.068
Yeah.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.112
Best wide receiver I ever saw.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.196
Put your hands behind your back.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.491
Don't say a word, man.
We're sorry, you're a real fast runner.

05:25.867 --> 05:26.826
Not fast enough.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.537
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:29.829 --> 05:31.581
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:31.664 --> 05:35.376
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:35.460 --> 05:37.086
(sirens wailing)

05:42.925 --> 05:45.845
(theme music playing)

07:44.213 --> 07:45.923
I must have seen you 20 times.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.593
That catch in the championship game
against Pittsburgh.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.053
Ninety-eight yards, man, were you flying.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.054
Yeah, it was a great moment.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.057
This guy is gonna have
a million dollar's worth of endorsements

07:55.141 --> 07:56.893
go right down the tube.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.020
Mr. Jackson, do you want your lawyer?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.855
No, no, I don't want him involved in this.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.023
Can I get a regular lawyer?

08:02.106 --> 08:03.608
-You mean a public defender?
-Right.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.151
Yeah, anything you want.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.279
Hey, Russo,
any problem listing Jackson's pop

08:08.362 --> 08:10.323
on the day sheet as a John Doe?

08:10.406 --> 08:11.365
Okay with me.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.202
Great, we'll keep it out of the press
for a while.

08:14.952 --> 08:15.995
I gotta call my lawyer.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.706
Well, first you get fingerprinted,
then you can call your lawyer.

08:18.789 --> 08:21.417
But in the meantime let me tell you
about all the pleasure you have given me

08:21.501 --> 08:23.336
on the TV set on Sundays.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.379
Buddy, you're one kind of athlete,
I'll tell you that.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.548
Yeah, it's been a great career.

08:27.632 --> 08:28.966
RENKO: Picture, Jim.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.718
See me afterwards, blood.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.720
Jimmy fix you up with whatever you need.

08:32.803 --> 08:33.638
BATES: Go!

08:33.721 --> 08:35.306
Russo, let me hold a 330... (mutters)

08:35.640 --> 08:37.725
Hey, I hear you put the arm
on Raymond Jackson.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.436
Why would a guy like that
be out looking for a street hooker?

08:41.062 --> 08:43.481
Athletes need human contact, too.

08:46.943 --> 08:51.322
Okay... you sign here, Dr. Fenwick.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.742
Detective Washington and me
will list the items on this form.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.619
Let me just think
if they stole anything else.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.080
You said, a watch, your ring,
and your wallet.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.290
I'd like a minute to think if there was
anything else, Detective.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.167
I just received
a traumatic blow to the head.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.585
Just take your time, Doctor, okay?

09:04.669 --> 09:07.088
On the other hand, Neal,
we both know that 80 percent

09:07.171 --> 09:09.465
of stolen goods are recovered
within the first hour,

09:09.549 --> 09:12.510
and we both know what happens
to that recovery curve

09:12.593 --> 09:14.095
the longer the trail gets cold.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.429
It's the ring that's most important.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.391
It was a caduceus ring my wife gave me
when I graduated medical school.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.935
That's the kind of specialty item
they unload quickest.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.436
I guess that's it.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.275
Anything else comes to mind,
this is a priority phone line.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.359
You've got both my numbers.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.735
Work and home.

09:30.528 --> 09:33.072
Well, we better check out
those pawn shops, Neal.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.992
Hmm, you wouldn't be planning on making
a slight detour, would you, lover?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.743
You mean, to the police firing range,

09:37.827 --> 09:41.581
check out a tiger who's maybe
gonna make us four grand?

09:41.664 --> 09:43.040
It's possible, Neal.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.294
You know, you never can tell
where stolen goods are gonna show up.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.837
-Neal, J.D.
-Captain.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.381
-Mick.
-Captain.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.217
Uh, we may have a problem
with your bakery undercover.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.135
Don't say that.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.095
The baker's wife phoned,
she said her husband

09:56.178 --> 09:57.513
checked into the hospital
with hypertension.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.308
Captain, if I don't
get off this desk today,

10:00.766 --> 10:02.935
Robin is going to go to jail for murder.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.273
Look, I can document the extortion myself.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.026
I tell the juice guys
I'm the baker's nephew.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.528
Are you sure you're all right?
It's barely been two weeks.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.446
I feel good.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.448
Please.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.242
All right, if the baker's wife agrees.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.243
-Thank you.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.037
-Take it easy, Mick.
-Nice and easy, Captain.

10:21.120 --> 10:21.954
-Mick.
-Henry.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.706
-Henry.
-Just heard back from Samoa.

10:23.998 --> 10:24.832
Any good?

10:24.915 --> 10:28.252
"No contact with Howard Hunter
since my arrival here 14 months ago.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.212
Gravely concerned
by your news he is missing.

10:30.296 --> 10:34.842
Please apprise of further developments,
Prunella Ashton-Wilkes."

10:34.925 --> 10:38.471
Might be nice if they circulated
a picture of Howard from this decade.

10:38.554 --> 10:39.930
Well, joining her in Samoa

10:40.014 --> 10:43.017
was about the only thing
I could think of Howard's doing

10:43.434 --> 10:46.062
where he might have felt he had
some reason not to contact us.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.229
There's still the amnesia.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.024
The recurrence from when he got
hit on the head last year.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.317
-Right.
-I mean, a guy doesn't just

10:51.400 --> 10:52.485
disappear into thin air.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.196
Think he's dead?

10:57.198 --> 10:58.032
Joe?

10:58.324 --> 10:59.950
I-It's okay, mom is fine.

11:01.243 --> 11:04.455
Um, my brother Joe,
Detective Henry Goldblume.

11:04.538 --> 11:05.581
-How do you do?
-Good to meet you.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.751
I don't have deposition
on Fernandez till 3:00,

11:09.001 --> 11:11.337
I'm gonna check some emergency rooms,
put some more of these up.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.254
Take Kolzicki.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.172
Good to meet you.

11:15.591 --> 11:16.801
(door closes)

11:17.259 --> 11:18.386
Ah, how's Sophie?

11:18.469 --> 11:20.304
She's good. She's real good. Joyce?

11:20.388 --> 11:21.263
-Fine.
-Good.

11:23.057 --> 11:23.891
What is it, Joe?

11:25.142 --> 11:26.644
I'm all jammed up, Frank.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.604
It's the business.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.524
Well, it's winter, it couldn't have been
very good for construction.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.610
Twenty-three days out of 50,
do you believe that?

11:36.737 --> 11:39.532
We lost 23 days out of 50 to bad weather.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.869
And just when I take a flier.

11:45.913 --> 11:46.914
What do you mean?

11:48.457 --> 11:49.750
I don't know if you remember,

11:50.501 --> 11:52.169
when Papa passed, when you came home,

11:53.254 --> 11:57.466
I told you I was low bid on a pod mall
down on Willington Street.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.843
I thought you were very happy with that.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.972
I went bare bones on my estimates.
I really wanted the work.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.476
I-I gave low estimates on everything.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.061
And to make it up...

12:11.313 --> 12:12.982
I didn't buy a completion bond.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.317
I took the money and I bought materials.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.402
I took a chance.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.029
Then...

12:23.409 --> 12:25.035
Then nothing, nothing but snow.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.455
How much is it going to cost?

12:29.915 --> 12:34.044
I gotta pay $22,000
in lateness penalties by next Monday.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.296
Now, Frank...

12:37.214 --> 12:39.175
there's brothers and there's brothers.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.635
I know what kind
of brothers we've been and...

12:47.141 --> 12:49.435
I don't have any right to ask you this.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.437
I'd like to help you out, Joe.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.190
I am... right up against the wall.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.567
I am maxed out with all the money people.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.068
I said I want to help you.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.407
Are you kidding?

13:03.491 --> 13:05.409
Well, I ought to be able
to get it from the bank.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.619
You mean it?

13:07.369 --> 13:08.287
You ought to be able to get it?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.623
Ah, I'll make a phone call.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.000
I'm embarrassed.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.669
I don't know what to say.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.256
-It's okay.
-I don't know what to say.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.549
It's okay, Joe, it's okay.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.556
(gunshots)

13:33.854 --> 13:34.688
What do you think?

13:35.147 --> 13:36.232
He's got the talent.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.817
You think he can take Cataldo?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.694
That, I haven't decided yet.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.950
Hear you formed another syndicate, LaRue.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.993
Here we go, same old song.

13:48.285 --> 13:51.455
LaRue ever tell you about that syndicate
he formed to back that comedian?

13:51.539 --> 13:53.374
Hey, Big Hitler happened to be
a very funny dude, man.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.042
When he was awake.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.293
Narcoleptic comic.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.796
You know, there's two kinds of people
in the world, Sterling.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.465
There's guys like me
that try to make things happen,

14:01.549 --> 14:04.343
and there's guys like you
who Monday morning quarterback.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.595
Hey, hey, J.D., check out Cataldo.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.055
Maybe we can learn something here.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.142
Nice shooting.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.104
Thanks.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.982
You ever enter one of these things before?

14:18.774 --> 14:19.608
Tell me about it.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.861
Everybody's got something different.

14:21.944 --> 14:27.157
Me, my secret is I just
center in on the target

14:27.783 --> 14:28.742
and picture Charlie.

14:30.035 --> 14:30.870
No kidding.

14:32.079 --> 14:32.913
Yeah.

14:33.539 --> 14:37.001
I picture his screaming,
tortured face as I blow him away.

14:38.544 --> 14:43.424
I hear his death rattle
as I zero in on his mouth.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.010
Bull's-eye.

14:47.511 --> 14:48.554
Then I let loose.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.515
I'm at one with the target,
just me and Charlie.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.267
Who's Charlie,
is that some friend of yours?

14:53.767 --> 14:54.602
Are you kidding me?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.687
Yeah, maybe just a little.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.401
Give the tired head games a rest, Cataldo.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.737
Just enjoy watching me shoot.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.532
Look at that.

15:08.908 --> 15:09.742
Not bad.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.702
What do you think, J.D.?

15:12.119 --> 15:13.329
I think the kid's got it.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.205
Tommy, come here.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.832
Hey, J.D.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.959
This year's model, LaRue?

15:19.418 --> 15:21.253
Kid's got ice water in his veins.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.588
So, how're you feeling?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.256
Oh, man, did you see that, J.D.?

15:24.340 --> 15:25.591
That old guy tried to psych me.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.051
Yeah, but you showed him though,
didn't you, Tommy?

15:27.134 --> 15:28.469
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, I bet you wished

15:28.552 --> 15:30.888
-the contest was right now.
-Oh, you got it.

15:30.971 --> 15:31.805
Give me your wrist.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.724
-What are you talking about?
-Humor me.

15:37.102 --> 15:41.398
Your pulse is 150, Tommy, minimum.
You may not live till tonight.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.192
You know, if you were this excited

15:43.275 --> 15:45.194
the first time you got some,
you didn't get any.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.364
Look, I'm telling you, LaRue,
I am gonna take this guy.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.573
Good luck.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.408
My syndicate ain't backing you.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.577
Hey, that's your problem.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.621
You guys are washed up, just like Cataldo.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.165
I'd rather not bet, than back a loser.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.501
Iron Mike.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.544
What do you know, Buntz?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.630
Tonight's the big night, huh, Mike?

16:04.713 --> 16:07.049
Coming up for your annual moment of glory?

16:08.217 --> 16:09.134
You entering this year?

16:09.218 --> 16:10.511
Yeah, sure, Mike.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.263
And then I'm going out
and getting my other seven merit badges.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.516
You know,
I'm almost eligible for Eagle Scout.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.518
Would you mind stepping back?

16:17.601 --> 16:18.644
Let's see what you got.

16:18.727 --> 16:19.561
No, no, no, you see,

16:19.645 --> 16:22.022
I don't do this
to show you what I got, Mike.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.608
I do this 'cause I'm a cop,
and I want to keep my eye.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.415
Nice shooting.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.959
Well, thanks, Mike.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.669
You got any gold stars?

16:46.839 --> 16:47.923
Man can shoot.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.258
Mm-hmm.

16:52.011 --> 16:52.845
Oh, boy.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.431
Are you all right?

16:55.514 --> 16:58.267
Oh, I had a little accident
a couple weeks ago,

16:58.350 --> 17:00.352
the stitches still bother me sometime.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.522
Now, Mrs. Lasculi,

17:03.897 --> 17:04.940
when this man comes in,

17:05.024 --> 17:07.317
if he's the same one
that threatened your husband,

17:07.401 --> 17:09.820
I want you to give me
a little pinch right here, okay?

17:10.654 --> 17:12.072
You want me to pinch you?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.366
Give me a little pinch, see,
'cause if it's the same guy

17:14.450 --> 17:17.119
I'm not gonna give him the money,
I'm gonna make him bring his boss,

17:17.202 --> 17:20.456
'cause we want to make sure we get
all the evidence we can on everyone

17:20.539 --> 17:21.707
before we make our arrests.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.752
Oh, look what my Dom got me into.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.379
The man's not just weak
in his circular system,

17:27.463 --> 17:29.173
he's weak in his will.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.426
Once I got him to go
to Gambler's Anonymous,

17:32.509 --> 17:33.802
he came home drunk.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.263
How long's he been involved with shylocks?

17:36.346 --> 17:38.098
Oh, I'm not sure.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.641
He's afraid to tell me.

17:39.975 --> 17:44.229
God love him, if I would have known
how deep he was getting in,

17:44.313 --> 17:46.565
I would have sent him
to the hospital myself.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.818
Take a look out on the street,
Mrs. Lasculi.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.656
Morning.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.450
Mr. Lasculi.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.535
MICK: Ah, Mr. Lasculi ain't here.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.162
Then who are you?

18:00.537 --> 18:01.997
I'm Mr. Lasculi's nephew.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.251
Okay, Auntie, I understand.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.170
Yeah, but you're in charge here, right?

18:09.254 --> 18:11.882
Are you aware your uncle
has a loan payment due?

18:12.174 --> 18:13.592
-No.
-(sighs)

18:14.009 --> 18:15.844
Ma'am, are you aware of this loan?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.347
Leave me alone. I'm a helpless woman.

18:18.722 --> 18:22.351
Hey, listen,
I'm supposed to pick up $2,000 here.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.896
Mr. Lasculi understood,
it was supposed to be here 10 o'clock.

18:25.979 --> 18:29.691
Now I gotta come back here with my boss,
and that makes me look bad.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.528
My husband's in the hospital.
This boy's just filling in.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.696
Yes, any messages you got,
I'm happy to take them.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.949
Yeah, great, give him this.

18:40.702 --> 18:41.870
Four o'clock.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.831
I'll be back here with my boss.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.250
You'd better have the two bones.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.089
(bell jingles)

18:54.716 --> 18:58.137
Uh, Hill, this John Doe
that you have on your day sheet,

18:58.220 --> 19:00.139
that wouldn't happen to be
Raymond Jackson, would it?

19:00.222 --> 19:01.140
What makes you say that?

19:01.223 --> 19:02.516
Well, that's Jackson's wife.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.393
-Interrogation room's off limits.
-Uh-uh.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.520
It's for attorney-client conferences only.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.648
I just saw my husband going back there.
He wants me in there with him.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.650
It's not up to me,
I'm just telling you the rules.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.944
If it's not up to you,
why don't you get the hell out of my way?

19:14.027 --> 19:15.654
Ma'am, ma'am, just take it easy.

19:15.737 --> 19:16.613
MAN: Tonya!

19:16.697 --> 19:18.490
Ugh, they arrested Raymond.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.952
Ma'am, would you stop
putting a hole through my foot?

19:22.536 --> 19:25.706
Tonya, I don't want to be defending
two Jackson's today.

19:25.789 --> 19:26.790
-Thank you.
-Sergeant.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.419
JOYCE: Mr. Jackson,
I'll do whatever you instruct.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.880
But I'd think a person in your position

19:32.963 --> 19:36.216
to plead guilty to a charge
to sexual solicitation

19:36.300 --> 19:38.552
would mean considerable consequences.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.053
I just want to get it over with.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.097
And I don't want to get them involved.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.223
Get who involved?

19:43.515 --> 19:44.516
My lawyer,

19:44.600 --> 19:45.851
everyone else,

19:47.060 --> 19:48.061
my wife.

19:51.815 --> 19:52.816
MAN: Ray.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.695
I'm Arnold Resnick.
I'm Mr. Jackson's attorney.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.656
Look, I'm gonna plead
guilty on this, Arnie.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.783
Sorry I let everyone down.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.578
Let's you and I discuss
what we're gonna do, okay?

20:04.661 --> 20:07.289
Look, man, I blew it.
I propositioned an officer.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.208
There's no way
to sweep this under the rug.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.418
Ray, you're under
a lot of pressure right now.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.336
Would you excuse us?

20:12.419 --> 20:15.672
I haven't heard Mr. Jackson
say he wants to change attorneys.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.299
Look... (clears throat)
no offense intended,

20:17.382 --> 20:19.885
but I have represented
the Jackson's for six years.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.511
I think you can see the man
is overwrought.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.889
-(bangs table)
-Don't talk about me like I'm not here.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.434
Mr. Jackson, would you like
Mr. Resnick to represent you?

20:27.517 --> 20:28.602
I want this over with.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.564
Ray, you want it over,
we'll take care of it.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.817
But there are ways
and ways of pleading guilty.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.488
For God's sakes, don't throw
your whole life out, and Tonya's.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.574
Maybe you should represent me.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.677
Were you in with Raymond?
Is he all right? I'm his wife.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.761
-He's all right.
-(sighs)

21:03.220 --> 21:05.764
Why did he do it?
Did he say what was wrong?

21:05.847 --> 21:07.641
Excuse me, Mrs. Jackson,
I wondered if I could--

21:07.724 --> 21:08.892
No questions.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.143
Just get away from me.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.270
I know, I just--

21:11.353 --> 21:12.896
Please, please, what did he say?

21:12.980 --> 21:14.815
He didn't say why he did it.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.108
Is he gonna be all right?

21:16.858 --> 21:17.693
I hope so.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.737
Your husband couldn't have
a better lawyer than Mr. Resnick.

21:21.113 --> 21:21.947
Good.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.156
Please, excuse me.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.789
-Oh, hi.
-I think I need bifocals.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.333
When I was going to interrogation before,

21:33.417 --> 21:36.295
I could have sworn I saw your brother Joe
coming in the front door.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.212
You did.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.006
Is your mother all right?

21:39.089 --> 21:41.300
Oh yeah, yeah, everything's okay there.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.510
Um, Joe's out walking.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.306
He's been a little overwrought lately.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.475
He's having problems with his business
because of all this bad weather.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.479
He needs a $22,000 loan to tide him over.

21:55.647 --> 21:56.481
How can we get it to him?

21:56.565 --> 21:58.025
Well, the bank says
they'll give him the loan

21:58.108 --> 22:00.360
as long as we put up
our CDs as collateral.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.611
Those trusting souls.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.198
I'm due in court, will they take an okay
from me over the phone?

22:05.282 --> 22:06.575
As long as one of us signs.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.119
Here, ask for Mr. Foreman.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.705
Thanks.

22:12.622 --> 22:13.457
It's a good risk.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.584
I know someone in the family.

22:18.420 --> 22:22.049
Odds on the favorite,
Mike Cataldo, are now four to five.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.092
Come on, Jimmy, civilians.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.427
Book making's illegal.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.263
Come on,
just a friendly little office pool.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.181
Hey.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.059
I mean, the thing was so weird.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.935
On one hand we're chasing the perp,

22:34.019 --> 22:37.522
at the same time, it's like watching
this incredible athletic phenomenon.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.940
Something to tell your kids about.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.276
I guess I was so caught up
with that two-bit pimp

22:41.693 --> 22:42.861
I didn't even see the run.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.447
Hey, is this guy a side show
or a human being?

22:45.530 --> 22:48.700
Yeah, what's the matter with you people?
Ain't you got no compassion?

22:49.117 --> 22:51.370
You don't care about
other people's feelings?

22:52.746 --> 22:53.705
What's with her?

22:53.955 --> 22:55.540
-LUCY: Who knows?
-Who cares?

22:57.167 --> 22:59.211
Guess he does really stand
to lose a lot, huh?

22:59.294 --> 23:01.421
BOBBY: You get that famous,
you gotta watch your step.

23:04.132 --> 23:07.135
Hey, Norm, it's fight night on the tube.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.388
Maybe we pop a little corn later?

23:11.306 --> 23:12.140
Possible.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.520
You wanna front me a couple bucks,
I'll go get it now.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.231
What do you think, Neal,

23:19.314 --> 23:21.733
do I appeal to Buntz's ego
or to his wallet?

23:21.817 --> 23:23.318
I think first we pop Sid.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.945
I don't want to hear that.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.114
Description's an exact fit, J.D.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.157
Can't be too many of those
doctors' rings out there.

23:29.241 --> 23:33.370
Neal, we pop Sid, we're buying
four hours of arrest reports

23:33.453 --> 23:34.454
and an arraignment.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.748
No way we make the shooting contest.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.000
Hey, I saw what I saw, babe.

23:39.084 --> 23:42.045
(grumbling) I hate a fanatic.

23:44.631 --> 23:45.632
Hey, Norm.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.885
Sid, congratulations.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.262
Thanks very much, for what?

23:50.345 --> 23:54.307
Oh, you won the good citizenship award
for returning stolen goods.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.226
No, wait a minute,
you got it wrong, Detective.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.061
I've had this ring
since I don't know when--

23:58.145 --> 23:59.271
-Norm.
-Sid.

23:59.354 --> 24:01.523
You've had that ring
since 9:00 this morning.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.943
Now either I pop you
for felony receipt of stolen property

24:05.026 --> 24:07.863
or you win the good citizenship medal
for turning it in.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.531
I'll take the medal.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.325
Congratulations, Sid, now take off.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.452
My pleasure.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.663
Hey, Norm, you know one of these days
you're gonna stick up for me,

24:16.746 --> 24:18.457
I'm gonna fall over with a migraine.

24:18.540 --> 24:19.624
NORMAN: Don't hurt your head.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.801
You were looking pretty sharp
out on that practice range this morning.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.011
So?

24:32.846 --> 24:34.514
Hey, did you ever think about
entering that contest?

24:34.598 --> 24:36.099
Oh, you mean so I can win
one of those trophies

24:36.183 --> 24:37.726
where they unscrew the bowler from the top

24:37.809 --> 24:39.769
and then screw on a guy
shooting the targets?

24:39.853 --> 24:41.313
Forget trophies, Norm.

24:41.396 --> 24:44.524
I'm talking about Jimmy Falon's
offering field odds 20-1

24:44.608 --> 24:46.943
anybody who beats Mike Cataldo.

24:47.027 --> 24:50.655
Now, I got a syndicate
willing to place $400 on a live entry.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.532
Promise to buy me a malted afterwards?

24:52.616 --> 24:55.827
You'd be in for 20 percent, Norm,
and you wouldn't have to put up a nickel.

24:55.911 --> 24:59.164
Plus, you get to show up
that tin soldier Cataldo.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.540
Hmph.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.668
These contests are for guys
like Cataldo, you know?

25:03.752 --> 25:06.087
Put him out on the street,
ten minutes he's crying for mommy.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.215
Yeah, I know what you mean.

25:09.132 --> 25:12.552
Just once, once,
I'd like to see a real cop win it.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.346
Hey, LaRue, shut up.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.348
Right, sorry.

25:21.269 --> 25:22.521
Twenty percent?

25:23.021 --> 25:24.356
Twenty percent.

25:26.858 --> 25:27.859
Okay.

25:28.652 --> 25:29.611
Hey.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.451
Jimmy, hey!

25:38.203 --> 25:40.455
You still offering field odds 20-1?

25:40.539 --> 25:41.540
Twenty to one.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.291
Four yards.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.461
Who's your dark horse?

25:46.545 --> 25:48.004
You'll find out soon enough.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.967
Oh, and Jimmy, don't worry about anything.

25:52.050 --> 25:55.554
The PBA's got a great program
for indigent cops.

25:55.637 --> 25:56.721
(chuckles)

26:00.642 --> 26:03.270
The Gazelle Company
continues to have full faith

26:03.353 --> 26:07.274
in Raymond Jackson
as an individual of honor and integrity.

26:07.357 --> 26:10.193
But are you going to continue using him
to endorse your product?

26:10.277 --> 26:11.611
We stand by our statement.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.696
How do you feel about the charges

26:12.779 --> 26:15.323
your husband solicited a prostitute,
Mrs. Jackson?

26:15.407 --> 26:18.743
I don't know what went on this morning,
but I do know my husband,

26:18.827 --> 26:21.621
and he has no need to go out
and solicit prostitutes.

26:21.705 --> 26:22.998
REPORTER: So he'll be pleading not guilty?

26:23.081 --> 26:25.208
I don't know what's going to happen.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.336
Frank, believe me, we're about to wind up
with egg on our puss.

26:28.420 --> 26:32.340
Arnie Resnick's this close
to positioning us as puritanical prigs.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.217
Gentlemen.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.677
Grateful for the meeting.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.306
Mr. Resnick, believe me,
no one takes pleasure

26:39.389 --> 26:40.473
in your client's situation.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.893
Hell, I've seen this fella
do things on a football field

26:43.977 --> 26:45.520
brought a damn lump to my throat.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.607
Raymond Jackson's
been my friend for six years.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.526
There's no way I can make you
understand him in two minutes.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.404
What I can tell you
is that Raymond and his wife

26:54.487 --> 26:56.406
love and depend on each other.

26:56.990 --> 27:00.243
That Raymond is neither
a drug user nor a partier.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.620
If he were either of those things,

27:01.703 --> 27:04.414
he wouldn't be on that street corner
at seven o'clock in the morning

27:04.497 --> 27:06.374
like a 15-year-old school kid.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.168
The fact is that's where he was arrested.

27:08.251 --> 27:12.672
Look, it's pretty obvious that right now,
Ray Jackson's a troubled individual.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.091
He's coming to the end of a great career.

27:15.383 --> 27:18.428
He's trying to make
some transitions in his life,

27:18.637 --> 27:20.805
and the pressure from all that
is compounded by his

27:20.889 --> 27:22.974
being looked up to by so many people.

27:23.058 --> 27:26.186
Captain, it's my understanding
this sort of charge

27:26.269 --> 27:29.272
gets pleaded down to public nuisance
more or less as a matter of course.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.231
Would he plead to that?

27:30.315 --> 27:33.026
I'd also like to be able
to make some explanatory remarks

27:33.109 --> 27:35.612
both in court and subsequently

27:36.196 --> 27:39.991
that the police department
would agree not to contradict.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.786
Alleging misconduct on the part
of the arresting officers?

27:42.869 --> 27:43.745
Would you let me get away with it?

27:43.828 --> 27:45.080
Absolutely not.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.957
I am hardly in
the cat bird seat here, Captain.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.837
How about something along the line that...

27:53.672 --> 27:57.926
the department had cast a wide net,
and that the operation was meant more

27:58.009 --> 27:59.552
to deter street walkers
and catch criminals?

27:59.636 --> 28:02.305
Couldn't hurt to get painted
tough on prostitution, Captain.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.224
As long as there's
no implication of entrapment.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.184
Would that be acceptable?

28:06.267 --> 28:07.102
Irwin?

28:07.477 --> 28:08.561
No problem for us.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.563
Then you've got a deal.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.733
Captain, why don't you confer
with your arresting officers?

28:13.817 --> 28:16.027
Make sure we're all on the same page.

28:17.904 --> 28:18.780
Counselor?

28:20.532 --> 28:23.993
I've got a nephew at home
who would do handsprings

28:24.452 --> 28:27.038
if I came home
with Raymond Jackson's autograph.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.546
How'd it come out, Captain?

28:34.879 --> 28:38.091
Jackson's entering a plea of guilty
of being a public nuisance.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.008
Sound's right.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.010
We've agreed not to counter any statement

28:41.094 --> 28:44.097
Jackson or his lawyer
may make at trial or afterwards

28:44.180 --> 28:45.765
to the press about what
he was doing down there.

28:45.849 --> 28:48.101
Now wait a minute,
did I just get hung out to dry here?

28:48.184 --> 28:50.145
No, no, they've specifically agreed

28:50.228 --> 28:53.273
not to allege entrapment
or misconduct on your part.

28:53.648 --> 28:54.858
Someone to see you, Captain.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.526
Okay, Sergeant. Are you both agreeable?

28:56.609 --> 28:58.027
-No problem here.
-Yeah.

29:00.822 --> 29:01.740
I just don't get it.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.616
Get which event, Officer Russo?

29:04.659 --> 29:05.660
Jackson, what--

29:06.870 --> 29:09.038
What was he doing out there,
what was he looking for?

29:09.122 --> 29:11.040
Hey, I'm with you, Officer Russo.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.709
I mean,
the only important things in the world

29:12.792 --> 29:15.628
are staying comfortable
and not getting too involved

29:15.712 --> 29:18.214
and having a little fun in the rack.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.258
A sensitive person like you,

29:20.341 --> 29:22.677
I could see where something
like this wouldn't add up.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.304
I'm gonna slap you in the face.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.306
Yeah, well you'd better
do it running, sweetheart,

29:26.389 --> 29:27.891
'cause I might hit you back.

29:30.810 --> 29:34.063
You never mentioned in your telegram
that you were returning from Samoa.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.232
Well, receiving word
about Lieutenant Hunter

29:36.316 --> 29:37.984
was like a blinding light.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.236
I left the airport as if in a dream.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.072
Um, has there been any further word?

29:43.156 --> 29:44.282
I'm afraid not.

29:45.074 --> 29:45.909
I see.

29:45.992 --> 29:50.371
Lieutenant Hunter had an episode
of traumatic amnesia last year.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.414
I recall.

29:51.498 --> 29:54.083
And we're just hoping
he's walking around somewhere.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.377
Yes, the alternative is unthinkable.

29:58.880 --> 30:05.178
Captain, you may not realize that it was I
who abandoned the lieutenant.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.765
The victim of my own
irreconcilable passions.

30:08.848 --> 30:12.268
The man I eloped with,
my Samoan chieftain,

30:12.352 --> 30:14.437
represented the exotic, the primitive.

30:15.104 --> 30:19.025
While the lieutenant meant everything
that was noble, disciplined,

30:19.108 --> 30:22.529
familiar in the best sense
of the word, and...

30:24.072 --> 30:26.199
Yet I succumbed to the remote.

30:26.282 --> 30:28.660
You don't have to explain,
Mrs. Ashton-Wilkes.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.370
During the 14 months

30:30.453 --> 30:32.372
that I was with my Samoan,

30:33.498 --> 30:37.627
I carried the thought of Howard
within me like an anchor.

30:37.710 --> 30:41.506
An island of stability waiting for me.

30:41.756 --> 30:44.968
It's as if I have awakened
from a long sleep.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.720
Let's hope this has a happy outcome.

30:47.804 --> 30:48.721
No, no.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.810
Lieutenant Hunter
is alive somewhere, Captain.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.228
I feel his presence.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.940
Just as you and I are sitting here,
Howard lives.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.067
Where will you be staying?

31:01.150 --> 31:02.652
Oh, dear. (clears throat)

31:02.735 --> 31:06.447
There was a time when I had a key
to the lieutenant's apartment.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.158
Uh, have you changed the lock?

31:09.826 --> 31:10.660
Not that I know of.

31:10.743 --> 31:13.204
Then it is there
that I would prefer to stay.

31:13.496 --> 31:14.330
Fine.

31:15.081 --> 31:18.334
Oh, what has happened
to the Emperor Lao Tzu?

31:18.418 --> 31:20.253
Lieutenant Goldblume
boarded him at a kennel.

31:20.336 --> 31:22.589
I hope it isn't Filer and Waldrup.

31:23.506 --> 31:25.341
Oh, from my years of obedience,

31:25.425 --> 31:30.513
I've learned that one must never
underestimate how drastically

31:30.597 --> 31:35.602
months of training can be undone
by only two weeks of negligent pet care.

31:38.980 --> 31:39.856
Where did you go?

31:39.939 --> 31:40.773
Just walked.

31:41.649 --> 31:42.984
I got lost about seven times.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.528
These aren't the greatest neighborhoods
to get lost in.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.327
How'd it go at the bank?
Did it work out all right?

31:53.119 --> 31:54.704
It's set up for 24 payments.

31:58.791 --> 32:01.085
I'm gonna send this
right into the bank, Frank.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.879
This is the last
you're gonna hear about it.

32:03.379 --> 32:04.339
Don't you want the check?

32:05.715 --> 32:06.966
Yeah, that might help.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.594
Joey, what if the weather stays bad?

32:09.677 --> 32:11.888
No problem,
I'll throw myself off a bridge.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.849
The loan officer at the bank was saying
that some construction companies up here

32:14.933 --> 32:17.393
are missing two and three
penalty dates, not just one.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.896
My next penalty date's
not till eight weeks.

32:20.355 --> 32:22.732
The weather can't stay that bad,
not till May.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.109
Since when did you get into
the construction business?

32:25.193 --> 32:26.527
Not me. My brother.

32:33.451 --> 32:37.372
You know, I asked myself about 50 times,
how could I take a flier like this?

32:41.376 --> 32:43.419
Seems like ever since Papa died...

32:45.213 --> 32:47.256
I don't know,
it's like I'm a different person.

32:50.760 --> 32:51.761
I'm worried, Frank.

32:52.345 --> 32:54.847
I'm worried that life is gonna pass me by.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.349
I guess we're out from under the tree.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.393
Yeah, that's the truth.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.602
Funny, I had a dream,

32:59.686 --> 33:04.023
Papa was sailing away on a trip,
and I felt left behind.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.568
I guess we're never gonna
finish up with Papa, huh?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.280
It's kind of nice, maybe,

33:12.699 --> 33:14.450
his sons got a chance to get together.

33:16.452 --> 33:20.999
J3309, Your Honor,
Raymond Jackson, 207 of the penal code,

33:21.082 --> 33:23.042
solicitation to commit an immoral act.

33:23.459 --> 33:26.713
Complaining officers,
Celestina Russo and Patrick Flaherty.

33:26.796 --> 33:31.801
I see Mr. Jackson is represented by
an appropriately heavy hitter.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.469
Arnold Resnick, Your Honor.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.804
IRWIN: Approach the bench, Your Honor.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.347
Counsel, approach.

33:38.558 --> 33:41.310
Defendant stipulated to a charge
of public nuisance, Your Honor.

33:41.394 --> 33:44.731
Then why are you standing here instead
of behind your desk, Mr. Bernstein?

33:44.814 --> 33:47.984
There's a further agreement as to remarks
I will have entered on the record.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.652
Brevity, Mr. Resnick.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.280
Consonant with my client's interest,
Your Honor.

33:57.076 --> 33:58.745
Mr. Jackson is willing to enter a plea.

33:58.828 --> 34:02.081
Guilty to the misdemeanor charge
of public nuisance, Your Honor.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.417
-People?
-No objection, Your Honor.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.462
I'd like to enter a statement
on Mr. Jackson's behalf

34:07.879 --> 34:09.422
before Your Honor pronounces sentence.

34:09.505 --> 34:10.339
Yeah?

34:10.423 --> 34:12.508
Simply that Mr. Jackson appears here,

34:12.592 --> 34:15.094
Your Honor, as the result
of a police operation

34:15.178 --> 34:18.931
whose admitted goal was harassment
and deterrence of prostitution.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.684
And the placation
of neighborhood merchants,

34:22.143 --> 34:25.354
rather than any substantive end
of law enforcement.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.691
And that having entangled
Mr. Jackson in its wide

34:28.775 --> 34:30.943
and indiscriminately cast net,

34:31.027 --> 34:35.073
this same department,
to save face for itself,

34:35.156 --> 34:37.033
now proposes a plea arrangement,

34:37.617 --> 34:40.328
which the practicality
of Raymond's position

34:40.411 --> 34:42.705
makes it impossible for him to refuse.

34:43.539 --> 34:46.000
I can only hope that to the extent

34:46.084 --> 34:48.586
the police permit them
to become available,

34:49.045 --> 34:53.299
the media will show the same appetite
and enthusiasm I see here today

34:53.382 --> 34:57.303
in publicizing the actual facts
of Raymond Jackson's arrest.

34:57.386 --> 35:00.139
I suspect, though, that what
we will hear from the police

35:00.223 --> 35:03.851
in the matter
of <i>People vs. Raymond Jackson</i>

35:03.935 --> 35:06.020
is a steady stream of "no comments."

35:06.437 --> 35:09.107
-Thank you, Your Honor.
-9.9, Mr. Resnick.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.237
Mr. Jackson, quit while you're ahead?

35:15.822 --> 35:17.073
Guilty, Your Honor.

35:17.156 --> 35:19.075
JUDGE: $100 fine.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.828
Mrs. Jackson, if we could
just have a comment, please.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.329
-Mr. Jackson, one word.
-Can you comment--

35:23.412 --> 35:25.414
Mr. Jackson has a statement.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.583
Here are your notes, Raymond.

35:31.754 --> 35:33.714
I appreciate people trying to protect me.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.468
Fact is, I made a mistake.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.471
And I hope the public can understand that.

35:42.890 --> 35:45.434
Sometimes no matter how hard you try,
you can never...

35:46.185 --> 35:47.979
never be the guy they talk you up to be,

35:49.063 --> 35:50.231
the guy you want to be.

35:51.732 --> 35:54.068
So you wind up driving around
in the middle of the night

35:54.819 --> 35:55.778
feeling like a jerk.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.406
A fraud.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.245
I know a lot of people look up to me,
and I appreciate that.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.456
But when it's all said and done,

36:09.208 --> 36:12.044
I'm just a human being, that's all.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.341
And I'd like to apologize to my wife.

36:18.384 --> 36:21.220
Mr. Jackson, are you planning
on speaking at the--

36:21.304 --> 36:22.555
I think that's enough questions.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.974
REPORTER: Mrs. Jackson,
do you have a comment, please?

36:25.057 --> 36:26.058
I love my husband.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.817
(groans)

36:36.652 --> 36:37.528
What's that?

36:38.029 --> 36:40.489
This is the money
I'm giving to the juice guys.

36:41.157 --> 36:45.578
See, to make a really air tight arrest,
we want them to actually take this money.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.332
Oh, you're feeling bad, aren't you?

36:49.415 --> 36:51.209
Oh, I'm a little uncomfortable.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.878
Uh-oh, bingo.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.214
MICK: I want to do this real quick.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.596
I'm Joseph Santucci.

37:03.679 --> 37:06.349
How do you do? Money's all here.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.851
That's $2,000 in back interest.

37:08.935 --> 37:09.852
Correct.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.396
Jimmy tells me you're new.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.940
Yeah, I'm just filling in for my uncle.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.025
You understand the arrangement?

37:16.400 --> 37:20.279
Two hundred a week,
every week the loan's outstanding.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.156
I understand.

37:23.324 --> 37:26.661
No, but I mean do you understand?

37:28.329 --> 37:29.205
Deep down.

37:29.288 --> 37:30.414
What's going on?

37:30.498 --> 37:32.625
Two hundred a week, every week,
we're outstanding.

37:32.708 --> 37:36.003
Mr. Santucci,
my aunt and I, we understand.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.632
Do you understand deep down?

37:39.715 --> 37:41.008
I understand deep down.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.510
Please, take this money.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.845
What's, he gonna set a fire?

37:45.429 --> 37:47.765
-You bastard rats.
-MICK: Auntie.

37:47.848 --> 37:49.976
In another 30 seconds
he's gonna arrest you,

37:50.059 --> 37:51.811
and I'm supposed to stand back
and watch you set fire--

37:51.894 --> 37:53.396
All right, freeze!

37:53.479 --> 37:54.397
You're busted.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.066
Please, do not resist.
I've recently had surgery.

37:57.149 --> 37:58.317
If you make any attempt to escape,

37:58.401 --> 38:02.154
I'll be forced to use my weapon,
and I have a very short temper.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.364
Mrs. Lasculi, move away.

38:03.447 --> 38:06.492
Loan sharks, bums.
You gonna set us on fire?

38:07.368 --> 38:09.912
-Mrs. Lasculi.
-MRS. LASCULI: I'll give you a shot!

38:09.996 --> 38:12.206
(men groaning) Hey, hey!

38:16.419 --> 38:17.837
I'm sorry about what I said before.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.505
-That was a cheap shot.
-Forget it.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.007
I mean it, Tina, I'm sorry.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.759
You think I'm so stupid, Patrick?
You don't think I have any feelings?

38:23.843 --> 38:26.095
No, I told you it was a cheap shot.

38:26.595 --> 38:27.972
I know you got feelings.

38:29.348 --> 38:30.182
Just not for me.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.936
Look, don't worry, you don't gotta get
an unlisted number or anything.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.604
I'll... (chuckles)
I'll leave you alone.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.522
Fine.

38:39.608 --> 38:40.860
I'll see you, okay?

38:41.152 --> 38:42.278
Yeah, I'll see you.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.072
Go get 'em, killer.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.036
FRANK: Mick?

38:51.203 --> 38:52.621
Nice bust on those shylocks.

38:52.705 --> 38:53.581
Oh, thank you, Captain.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.166
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

38:55.249 --> 38:58.169
Oh, no, I can't do that,
I have to take this lady's statement,

38:58.252 --> 39:01.213
-I have to get this bozo--
-Keep that woman away from me.

39:01.297 --> 39:04.592
If I had my flour pin,
I'd fracture your skull for you.

39:04.675 --> 39:07.720
-Get her the hell off of me!
-Whoa, whoa, hey, hold on!

39:07.803 --> 39:09.388
MICK: Mrs. Lasculi, no!

39:12.475 --> 39:13.559
Oh, Mike.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.728
I didn't recognize you for a second.

39:16.562 --> 39:17.897
I hope you rot.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.648
I hope they throw the key away.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.984
Mrs. Lasculi,
let's go take your statement.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.820
Are you okay, Mike?
You look very uncomfortable.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.781
Mild pain.

39:31.994 --> 39:34.163
(gunshots in distance)

39:36.457 --> 39:38.250
Tommy, how'd you shoot?

39:38.334 --> 39:41.128
Three-sixty-six,
no way I make it to the finals.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.505
You'll get 'em next year.

39:42.797 --> 39:43.672
I don't understand it.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.633
I never shot that bad in practice.

39:46.759 --> 39:48.511
Cowardice is a funny thing.

39:49.762 --> 39:52.181
Hmm, Mike, a few seconds?

39:54.100 --> 39:56.519
-I'm up.
-Just for the sake of discussion, Mike.

39:56.602 --> 39:58.687
What if tonight wasn't your night?

39:58.771 --> 40:00.356
Well, whose night would it be?

40:00.439 --> 40:03.526
C'mon you've already won this thing,
what, four years in a row?

40:03.609 --> 40:06.195
I bet there might be
a couple of bucks in it for me.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.905
It might be worth a couple of bucks.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.283
It might be worth a couple of yards
to certain people.

40:11.367 --> 40:15.454
You're a stand-up guy, LaRue.
Real credit to the department.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.165
Hey, wait a second.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.167
-Is that a no?
-That's a no.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.378
I don't know why I even bothered, Cataldo.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.632
Buntz is gonna clean your clock,
he's gonna beat you fair and square.

40:26.715 --> 40:29.718
You wouldn't know fair and square
if it hit you with a truck.

40:46.569 --> 40:49.280
-Hmm, where you been, babe?
-The john, how's Buntz doing?

40:49.363 --> 40:50.197
Great.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.451
Boy, I wish I could shoot
like Norman Buntz.

40:53.534 --> 40:54.535
Me too, partner.

41:00.916 --> 41:03.752
ANNOUNCER: <i>That concludes the first flight</i>
<i>in the preliminary round.</i>

41:04.170 --> 41:05.421
<i>Judges will tabulate.</i>

41:05.671 --> 41:06.672
<i>Let's hear it for the contestants.</i>

41:06.755 --> 41:09.091
C'mon, what's the problem?
Let's hear the freakin' tab.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.968
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Winner is target lane number four,</i>

41:11.051 --> 41:13.095
-All right.
<i>-Lieutenant Norman Buntz of Hill Street.</i>

41:13.971 --> 41:16.056
O ye of little faith, huh, Sterling?

41:17.266 --> 41:20.686
And my man the king,
the lethal shooting machine.

41:20.769 --> 41:24.565
ANNOUNCER: <i>The defending champion,</i>
<i>Polk Avenue Detective Mike Cataldo.</i>

41:24.648 --> 41:27.109
(cheering)

41:27.193 --> 41:30.946
No, don't clap for this.
This is yesterday's news.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.782
Cataldo, Cataldo!

41:34.617 --> 41:37.161
Eat the big sandwich loaf!

41:47.338 --> 41:48.422
Oh...

41:51.550 --> 41:56.972
The touch of your pipe, Howard,
the smell of it fills me with hope.

42:00.893 --> 42:01.727
Ohh.

42:11.946 --> 42:16.367
Evenings spent cleaning
and loading your pistol.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.662
Relaxed, peaceful hours

42:19.745 --> 42:21.830
listening to <i>The Valkyrie</i>
on the phonograph.

42:22.706 --> 42:25.251
Crocheting pillows
for the underground shelter.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.003
We could have it all back.

42:39.974 --> 42:41.183
Oh, Howard.

42:42.768 --> 42:44.478
I feel you near.

42:47.940 --> 42:51.277
The tidal pull of your moons.

42:53.612 --> 42:57.199
Your lips, like marzipan.

43:00.077 --> 43:01.328
Do you hear me?

43:03.455 --> 43:04.999
But where are you?

43:07.084 --> 43:10.170
Can you-- can you give me a hint?

43:11.338 --> 43:12.798
An address?

43:16.010 --> 43:18.596
Oh, my brave warrior...

43:20.055 --> 43:22.641
I knew that you could hear me.
What's that?

43:26.103 --> 43:26.937
Really?

43:28.731 --> 43:29.982
(laughing)

43:38.407 --> 43:39.950
-Norm?
-What?

43:40.242 --> 43:41.368
You all right, how you feel?

43:42.036 --> 43:42.870
I'm resting.

43:43.662 --> 43:44.496
Oh.

43:45.372 --> 43:49.168
Oh, yeah, that's good, that's smart.
Get yourself settled before the final.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.880
Collect your, uh... your wits.

43:53.589 --> 43:54.882
All right.

43:57.968 --> 44:00.220
Norm, you shot fabulous.

44:00.846 --> 44:03.849
Believe me, you gave that guy Cataldo
something to think about.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.060
How'd Cataldo do in the prelims?

44:06.769 --> 44:07.603
Good.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.397
Fair. I mean, you know, he shot all right.

44:10.898 --> 44:11.899
How many'd he hit?

44:13.108 --> 44:17.196
I don't know, I think it was
like 997 out of 1,000.

44:17.279 --> 44:18.489
All right. (chuckles)

44:19.073 --> 44:20.324
Hey, listen, Norm.

44:21.367 --> 44:24.286
-(Norm sighs)
-You are going to kick this guy's heinie.

44:25.079 --> 44:28.082
You are gonna eat
this Mr. Big Shot Cataldo's breakfast.

44:28.165 --> 44:28.999
And you wanna know why?

44:29.083 --> 44:30.834
Sid, I'm really trying
to get some rest here.

44:30.918 --> 44:35.047
Right, the why is because now
it's mano a mano, it's just you and him.

44:35.130 --> 44:36.757
And the man ain't been created yet

44:36.840 --> 44:39.385
that goes one-on-one
with N. Buntz that he don't blink.

44:39.468 --> 44:41.804
Yeah, well, thanks for saying that, Sid,
but right now I just want--

44:41.887 --> 44:43.222
I know, you want to get
some rest, am I right?

44:43.305 --> 44:44.682
-Yeah.
-You got it.

44:47.142 --> 44:48.227
Just collect yourself.

44:48.977 --> 44:50.187
Just focus yourself.

44:50.813 --> 44:51.772
You know what you do?

44:52.690 --> 44:53.982
Picture your mind...

44:55.192 --> 44:56.235
somewhere else.

44:56.610 --> 44:58.028
Somewhere with a lot of...

44:59.613 --> 45:00.489
green crap.

45:02.991 --> 45:05.661
-All right, I'm gonna be outside.
-Yeah, okay.

45:05.744 --> 45:06.912
-You want anything before I go?
-No!

45:08.205 --> 45:09.039
Okay, good.

45:10.791 --> 45:11.667
I'll be outside.

45:16.547 --> 45:18.632
(gunshots)

45:46.535 --> 45:48.454
MAN: Yeah, all right.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.956
-Who won, Neal?
-I don't know.

45:51.039 --> 45:52.291
They're retrieving the targets.

45:53.041 --> 45:55.377
-I don't know.
-He lost, didn't he?

45:56.128 --> 45:57.129
FENWICK: Detective LaRue?

45:59.840 --> 46:01.884
-Detective LaRue?
-Yeah?

46:01.967 --> 46:03.677
They told me at your station house
I could find you here.

46:03.761 --> 46:06.597
I just wanted to express my gratitude
to you and your partner

46:06.680 --> 46:08.682
for recovering my medical school ring.

46:08.766 --> 46:09.600
Our pleasure.

46:09.683 --> 46:12.144
I mean you guys
obviously went the extra yard.

46:12.227 --> 46:14.146
You must have hit those pawn shops
like Normandy Beach.

46:14.229 --> 46:16.356
Look, Doc, I got your drift.

46:16.815 --> 46:19.818
You know, you cops
get a bum rap from the public.

46:20.360 --> 46:23.614
Believe me, from today on,
you're going to have Harold Fenwick

46:23.697 --> 46:24.782
singing your praises.

46:24.865 --> 46:27.826
Hey, I just blew $400
in a shooting contest.

46:27.910 --> 46:29.244
You want to sing my praises?

46:29.328 --> 46:31.371
Go home, do it in your shower!

46:32.080 --> 46:32.915
Go on!

46:33.540 --> 46:35.584
Just wanted to tell you
how grateful I was.

46:36.376 --> 46:40.547
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Winner is Mike Cataldo, 99 to 97.</i>

46:40.631 --> 46:42.007
Great shooting.

46:42.090 --> 46:44.802
Right, great shooting.

46:44.885 --> 46:49.097
Hey, believe me, combat situation's
entirely different story.

46:49.473 --> 46:53.435
In a combat situation,
this guy blows this guy's head off.

46:56.355 --> 46:58.023
When my brother Joey and I
were talking today,

46:58.106 --> 47:01.527
he was saying something about there
being kinds and kinds of brothers.

47:03.403 --> 47:04.238
Meaning?

47:04.530 --> 47:06.782
Meaning, we hadn't been close.

47:08.200 --> 47:11.703
That was why even when he got into trouble
it was so hard for him to come to me.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.457
Joe shares a part of the blame for that.

47:15.541 --> 47:16.917
He didn't mean it for blame.

47:17.626 --> 47:20.295
And he was right,
we weren't those kinds of brothers.

47:22.130 --> 47:23.465
From when we were kids.

47:26.343 --> 47:28.679
I think maybe part
of what I've been sad about

47:29.179 --> 47:33.475
is the feeling that my dad's dying
closed all our family accounts.

47:36.728 --> 47:39.064
Now there was no more chance
anything could change.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.109
Maybe today broke the ice.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.360
I hope so.

47:45.070 --> 47:48.323
I mean, my dad's gone.
Maybe between Joey and me...

47:51.451 --> 47:53.078
Think an old mutt can learn new tricks?

47:56.582 --> 47:59.251
Come here, Rover. Aah! (giggles)

48:08.677 --> 48:10.679
(closing theme music)
