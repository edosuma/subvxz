00:00.125 --> 00:02.125
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.208 --> 00:03.875
It means a lot to her to feel included.

00:03.959 --> 00:06.959
<i>Sometimes dark clouds</i>
<i>have silver linings.</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:09.000
He sort of asked me out.

00:09.083 --> 00:11.417
It's okay with you if I go out with him?

00:11.500 --> 00:12.792
<i>Sometimes they don't.</i>

00:12.875 --> 00:14.000
Once that baby comes,

00:14.083 --> 00:15.875
I'm gonna be stuck
raising a child alone.

00:15.959 --> 00:18.208
<i>When it comes to life</i>
<i>on Wisteria Lane...</i>

00:18.291 --> 00:19.500
Will you marry me?

00:19.583 --> 00:21.542
<i>...things that seem</i>
<i>too good to be true...</i>

00:21.625 --> 00:23.083
Does she know you killed your wife?

00:23.166 --> 00:24.375
<i>...usually turn out...</i>

00:24.458 --> 00:26.291
Get away from him now while you can.

00:26.375 --> 00:28.125
<i>...to be deadly.</i>

00:30.041 --> 00:32.667
<i>Brides are sensitive creatures,</i>

00:32.750 --> 00:34.709
<i>and no one knows this better</i>

00:34.792 --> 00:38.166
<i>than the bridesmaids</i>
<i>who have to deal with them.</i>

00:39.583 --> 00:42.083
Well, I think a 10-foot train is great,

00:42.166 --> 00:43.709
but a shorter one would be just as nice,

00:43.792 --> 00:47.083
and you wouldn't have to worry
about people tripping on it.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.709
Personally, I love smoked rabbit,

00:51.792 --> 00:55.041
but for a sure crowd-pleaser,
you can't beat chicken.

00:56.709 --> 00:59.583
Sure, who doesn't love
a string quartet?

00:59.667 --> 01:02.208
But if you got a band,
maybe people could dance,

01:02.291 --> 01:04.166
as opposed to sway.

01:05.834 --> 01:08.709
<i>But the one area</i>
<i>where a bridesmaid's tact</i>

01:08.792 --> 01:11.333
<i>is most required involves the dress...</i>

01:11.417 --> 01:12.959
So, what do you think?

01:13.041 --> 01:15.041
<i>...she's required to wear.</i>

01:15.125 --> 01:16.500
Well...

01:17.542 --> 01:21.458
I'm not sure that I've ever seen
this shade of green before.

01:21.542 --> 01:23.917
Yeah, don't you think
it'll be gorgeous with my colouring?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.542
- Yes, it would look perfect.
- For someone with your colouring.

01:27.625 --> 01:29.166
I mean, I was lucky to find these.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.250
It's not easy putting a wedding together
in two weeks.

01:31.333 --> 01:32.959
Then why the rush?

01:33.041 --> 01:36.375
Yeah, Bree. I'd have thought of you
as a person who wants time to plan.

01:36.458 --> 01:38.834
Well, Orson and I talked about it,

01:38.917 --> 01:41.792
and we just feel, at our age,
it's silly to wait.

01:41.875 --> 01:43.959
And with your help,
I'm sure we can get it all done.

01:44.041 --> 01:46.291
Well, we are happy to pitch in.

01:46.375 --> 01:47.583
Oh, that reminds me,

01:47.667 --> 01:49.375
I have to get a copy
of the seating chart for you.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.500
Gabby, you are in charge
of the centrepieces.

01:51.583 --> 01:54.667
And don't worry, Susan.
I will think of a job for you.

01:56.959 --> 01:59.792
Here's a job. How about talking her
out of marrying a homicidal dentist?

01:59.875 --> 02:02.166
Susan, we don't know that.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.834
All we have
is some crazy woman's accusation.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.333
His wife vanished
and he didn't even tell Bree.

02:07.417 --> 02:08.583
How much more proof do you need?

02:08.667 --> 02:10.875
He says he's innocent.
She believes him.

02:10.959 --> 02:13.041
If we say we don't,
she'll just end up hating us.

02:13.125 --> 02:15.667
Well, I'm sorry.
I cannot sit here on my key-lime ass

02:15.750 --> 02:18.667
and watch Bree
make the worst mistake of her life.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.834
And what mistake would that be?

02:24.667 --> 02:26.000
Well...

02:29.000 --> 02:30.417
Honestly...

02:31.750 --> 02:37.208
<i>Yes, a bridesmaid can question</i>
<i>many of the bride's choices...</i>

02:37.291 --> 02:39.417
These dresses are hideous.

02:40.250 --> 02:43.542
<i>...but the groom isn't one of them.</i>

03:26.917 --> 03:29.417
<i>The perfect couple.</i>

03:29.500 --> 03:32.166
<i>We've all met them, haven't we?</i>

03:32.250 --> 03:35.458
<i>That man and woman</i>
<i>so clearly made for each other,</i>

03:35.542 --> 03:38.875
<i>we feel certain</i>
<i>they're on the road to happiness.</i>

03:38.959 --> 03:41.792
<i>But that road has many detours.</i>

03:41.875 --> 03:47.125
<i>And even perfect couples</i>
<i>can find themselves at a dead end.</i>

03:47.208 --> 03:49.625
- You want what?
- You heard me.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.667
And I want the bedroom stereo,

03:51.750 --> 03:55.000
I want the marble console,
and that painting of Saint Augustine.

03:55.083 --> 03:58.417
- You don't even know who he is.
- I know he matches the drapes.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.083
- People, can we focus here?
- And I want my pearl necklace back.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.667
Don't think I didn't notice
that you swiped it.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.542
That was my mama's
and hers before her.

04:04.625 --> 04:05.792
I think it belongs in my family.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.000
There was a time that you thought
I belonged in your family,

04:08.125 --> 04:09.875
and you got over that.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.750
- Stop eating my fries.
- I'm hungry.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.291
You know what the doctor said.
You should see his cholesterol.

04:14.375 --> 04:17.125
- This man bleeds bacon grease.
- Enough!

04:19.375 --> 04:21.583
You two are gonna have to find a way
to deal with each other,

04:21.667 --> 04:24.000
because you are about to
bring a child into this world,

04:24.083 --> 04:26.709
and divorced or not,
once that child arrives,

04:26.792 --> 04:30.333
you'll be bound together
for as long as you live.

04:35.083 --> 04:39.333
Well, in that case,
have some more fries.

04:43.333 --> 04:46.166
- I'll pick Kayla up on Sunday.
- Whenever. Just go.

04:46.250 --> 04:50.333
- You and Turk have a great time.
- Oh, trust me, we will.

04:52.291 --> 04:55.041
The man is a jackhammer.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.333
- Bye, Tom.
- Bye.

04:56.417 --> 04:58.458
See you Sunday.

04:58.542 --> 05:00.208
Where is she going?

05:00.291 --> 05:05.041
She and Turk are going
down to the river for the weekend.

05:05.125 --> 05:07.500
That's Turk?
That's the new boyfriend? No.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.875
Hey, hey, hey, Tom, please.

05:08.959 --> 05:11.500
I don't want my daughter
hanging around with a guy like that.

05:11.583 --> 05:12.959
You haven't even met him.

05:13.041 --> 05:15.667
He could be
the sweetest man in the world.

05:19.583 --> 05:22.208
More importantly,
ever since he entered the picture,

05:22.291 --> 05:25.709
Squeaky Fromme is never around.
It has been bliss.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.959
I haven't made this face in a week.

05:29.041 --> 05:30.625
If you ruin this, so help me,
I will hurt you.

05:30.709 --> 05:32.542
Just look at him. Look at him, please.

05:32.625 --> 05:35.417
I swear, that is a child's skull
hanging from his rear-view mirror.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.417
- Doesn't that concern you?
- No, I'm good.

05:39.959 --> 05:41.709
Could be a monkey.

05:43.583 --> 05:48.458
I think I will have the mesclun salad.

05:48.542 --> 05:51.333
That's it? That's all you're having?

05:51.417 --> 05:53.625
Well, all the food is very expensive.

05:53.709 --> 05:55.208
You don't need to whisper.

05:55.291 --> 05:57.667
The waiter knows
they're robbing us blind.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.208
You can have whatever you want.

06:00.291 --> 06:04.583
In that case, I'll have the lobster bisque
and the veal with the black truffles.

06:04.667 --> 06:06.458
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, that's fine.

06:06.542 --> 06:08.291
I'll just have Jane moved
to the VA hospital.

06:08.375 --> 06:11.333
- Oh, my God.
- I'm kidding. It's fine.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.542
- I'll have what she's having.
- Of course.

06:14.667 --> 06:15.792
Thank you.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.542
God, I love seeing you laugh.

06:17.625 --> 06:21.417
Oh, well, it's been a long time since
I've been in the mood to. Thank you.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.709
Oh, dear God.

06:23.792 --> 06:27.333
- Did I squeeze too hard?
- No, it's my wife's parents.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.375
Oh. Oh, wow.
Oh, is this gonna be awkward?

06:31.458 --> 06:34.000
No, no, no, not unless,
of course, they see us.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.041
- Ian.
- Awkward.

06:36.792 --> 06:40.333
Jeff. Renee. What a delightful surprise.

06:41.917 --> 06:44.625
It's so good to see you, dear.

06:53.458 --> 06:56.542
Hello. I'm Renee,
and this is my husband, Jeff.

06:56.625 --> 07:00.041
- Susan Mayer.
- Doctor. Dr Susan Mayer.

07:00.125 --> 07:03.834
- She's new to Jane's neurology team.
- Oh.

07:05.041 --> 07:08.166
I just assumed
you worked in Ian's publishing house.

07:08.250 --> 07:12.333
Well, yes, how nice
that would have been, huh?

07:12.417 --> 07:17.125
But, no, no. I'm a brain specialist.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.250
Well, Dr Mayer, maybe I can ask you.

07:19.333 --> 07:22.709
Our daughter's most recent EEG
showed brain spikes,

07:22.792 --> 07:26.500
but it didn't change the score
on her Glasgow scale.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.083
Why is that?

07:29.208 --> 07:31.375
What an excellent question.

07:33.834 --> 07:37.417
And this is the spinal cord.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.250
And it, of course, attaches to the brain.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.709
You don't have to
dumb it down for us, Doctor.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.750
We've been dealing
with Jane's condition for years.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.041
Oh, good.

07:49.125 --> 07:52.041
Well, then, let's get technical.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.667
Let's give Dr Mayer the night off.

07:53.750 --> 07:57.583
She was in surgery for 10 hours today,
performing a craniotomy.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.917
That's exactly the procedure Jane had.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.625
How'd it go?

08:03.625 --> 08:07.417
Well, it just... Wow.

08:08.667 --> 08:11.834
I hear my phone vibrating.

08:11.917 --> 08:14.750
Hello. Dr Mayer.

08:15.792 --> 08:19.917
Yeah, what?
You say that his brain shut off?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.083
Oh, I'll be right there. Stat.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.709
I'm sorry. Duty calls.

08:31.792 --> 08:34.583
Orson, I moved the furniture back.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.166
Good Lord, Bree. Not again.

08:43.792 --> 08:46.458
Don't you want our first dance
to be perfect?

08:46.542 --> 08:49.291
There'll be 200 people staring at us.

08:52.959 --> 08:55.375
You know, Bree,

08:55.458 --> 08:57.333
since that incident
at our engagement party,

08:57.417 --> 08:59.375
there's been a lot of dark talk about me.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.458
Well, I don't pay attention to gossip.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.959
I'm just saying I would understand
if you had second thoughts

09:04.041 --> 09:06.959
about marrying a man
who's under a cloud.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.583
Well, no one who knows you

09:09.667 --> 09:12.125
could seriously believe
that you could hurt a woman.

09:12.208 --> 09:15.083
Strangers may talk,
but I know the truth.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.458
Really?

09:18.875 --> 09:20.750
Men have lied to me before.

09:20.834 --> 09:23.709
Believe me, it'll never happen again.

09:25.041 --> 09:27.250
So you trust me completely?

09:30.750 --> 09:32.333
Clearly I do.

09:35.333 --> 09:39.583
The body is unusually well-preserved
because it was buried in clay.

09:39.667 --> 09:44.417
- Do we have a cause of death?
- Blunt force trauma to the head.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.792
I want you to pull
all the missing persons reports.

09:46.875 --> 09:49.208
Cross-check against
her height, age and weight.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.625
I'm also running a DNA panel,

09:51.709 --> 09:54.000
since we won't be able
to use her dental records.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.542
Why not?

09:55.625 --> 09:58.709
Whoever killed her
pulled out all her teeth.

10:10.709 --> 10:12.041
Nora.

10:12.125 --> 10:14.333
What are you doing back?
Are you okay?

10:14.417 --> 10:17.375
- Shut the door.
- Okay.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.959
I don't want Kayla to find me like this.

10:20.041 --> 10:23.458
- What's wrong?
- Turk and I had a fight.

10:23.542 --> 10:26.709
What? No. No, no, no.

10:27.375 --> 10:30.208
- What happened?
- What happened is Turk is an ass.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.166
On the way to the river,
we stopped off at this bar,

10:32.250 --> 10:33.375
and we were playing pool

10:33.458 --> 10:35.083
and I got a little bitchy
with one of the waitresses.

10:35.166 --> 10:39.417
Who cares, right? I mean, who cares?
It's a bar, and we all do it, right?

10:39.500 --> 10:40.625
Right.

10:40.709 --> 10:45.583
So, he tells me to watch my mouth,
and I'm like, "Whoa,

10:45.667 --> 10:49.125
"get a load of Mr Two Strikes
trying to tell me how to act in public."

10:49.208 --> 10:51.583
And then he called me a whore.

10:51.667 --> 10:52.834
We're done.

10:52.917 --> 10:55.083
Okay, whoa, whoa. Take a deep breath.

10:55.166 --> 10:56.917
You don't break up with a guy

10:57.000 --> 11:00.417
because, in a weak moment,
he calls you a whore.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.875
And then, on the way out,
he threatened to hit me.

11:04.834 --> 11:07.041
Okay, but he didn't.
He didn't and, you know, until...

11:07.125 --> 11:09.667
Oh, jeez, Lynette.
Whose side are you on?

11:09.750 --> 11:11.458
I'm on the side of love.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.000
You guys seemed
like such a perfect couple.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.291
- I know.
- I just... I...

11:16.375 --> 11:21.250
You don't wanna throw that all away
'cause of a little fight with no hitting.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.208
No, it's over.

11:28.959 --> 11:32.417
I just got off the phone with
Turk's parole officer and I was like,

11:32.500 --> 11:35.000
"Guess who ain't in Nevada no more."

11:35.083 --> 11:36.458
Click.

11:44.542 --> 11:47.583
I think I'm gonna
have to stay here tonight.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.000
Freeze!

12:18.959 --> 12:21.417
- Austin?
- Hey, Aunt Edie.

12:23.792 --> 12:26.875
Anyway, Mom just got back
from a cruise to Jamaica

12:26.959 --> 12:30.083
with new boobs
and a 24-year-old cabin boy.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.875
Needless to say, me and Mr

12:31.959 --> 12:34.291
"Can I get you some more hot towels?"

12:34.375 --> 12:36.041
we didn't exactly hit it off.

12:36.125 --> 12:37.250
So after I broke his nose,

12:37.333 --> 12:39.667
I figured it was a great time
to come visit my favourite aunt.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.208
Your mom always did have
lousy taste in men.

12:42.291 --> 12:45.417
So, I figured
I'd crash here for the night,

12:45.500 --> 12:47.709
then hitch down to Mexico,
hang out, party.

12:47.792 --> 12:51.041
Yeah. I'm thinking, like, no way in hell.

12:51.792 --> 12:55.417
You're gonna stay here with me until
things blow over with your mom, okay?

12:55.500 --> 12:57.125
Cool. Thanks.

12:59.208 --> 13:04.291
- Oh, wait. You're 18, right?
- Well, that's what my ID says.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.250
Yeah, mine too.

13:15.417 --> 13:18.709
Hey!
You are supposed to be on bed rest.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.000
I'm bored.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.083
Well, why don't you try
putting on a pair of pants?

13:22.166 --> 13:24.709
That should kill a couple of hours.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.291
Hey, babe.

13:32.375 --> 13:35.709
Hey, what is she doing out of bed?
That can't be good for her.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.166
Or the stairs.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.583
- What do you want?
- The mediator was right.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.709
A month from now, we're not
just gonna be Carlos and Gabby,

13:43.792 --> 13:45.375
we're gonna be Mom and Dad.

13:45.458 --> 13:49.250
And I don't wanna be at war
with the mother of my child.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.667
So, here.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.917
Your mama's pearls?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.250
Carlos.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.250
Thank you.

13:59.333 --> 14:02.208
- And?
- And what?

14:02.291 --> 14:06.125
Wouldn't you like to make
some reciprocal gesture?

14:06.208 --> 14:10.542
Fine. You can come to Bree's
wedding reception, as my guest.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.125
- Thanks. Where is it?
- Here.

14:13.208 --> 14:16.166
Here? You're throwing the reception?

14:16.250 --> 14:17.917
Yeah, that's our wedding present
to Bree.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.083
So, I give you
a priceless family heirloom,

14:20.166 --> 14:23.667
and in return, you invite me to a party,
at my house, that I'm paying for?

14:23.750 --> 14:27.041
Well, what kind of gesture
did you have in mind?

14:32.792 --> 14:35.250
The things I'll do for jewellery.

14:40.417 --> 14:42.959
Susan, I am so sorry.

14:43.041 --> 14:44.542
Dr Mayer?

14:44.625 --> 14:46.959
Panic. Pure panic.

14:47.583 --> 14:48.667
Here.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.208
These are for ruining our first date.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.125
Not in front of Mike.

14:53.208 --> 14:56.375
Oh, look, Mike,
Ian brought you flowers.

14:56.458 --> 14:59.000
I'll just go put them in some water.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.792
Look, I was just trying
to protect Jane's parents.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.041
Oh, please.

15:07.125 --> 15:10.750
They still haven't accepted the fact
that Jane isn't going to wake up.

15:10.834 --> 15:14.083
If they knew that we were on a date,
that I was trying to move on,

15:14.166 --> 15:15.834
well, it would devastate them.

15:15.917 --> 15:18.792
That's a really lovely excuse,
but it isn't the whole story, is it?

15:18.875 --> 15:20.000
Excuse me?

15:20.083 --> 15:22.375
A part of you feels like
you're cheating on her.

15:22.458 --> 15:26.333
No. Well, perhaps a small part,
but that doesn't mean...

15:26.417 --> 15:29.166
It's all right, 'cause I feel guilty, too.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.041
That's why we should
just stop this right now,

15:31.125 --> 15:33.041
because it's all way too complicated,

15:33.125 --> 15:37.458
and I think we'd both be happier
if we just went back to being friends.

15:39.333 --> 15:42.125
Well, I don't think I can do that.

15:43.083 --> 15:47.417
The truth is, I haven't thought of you
as just a friend for some time now.

15:47.500 --> 15:51.041
Maybe I shouldn't have let myself
feel that way, but I have.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.625
And I can't go back. I'm sorry.

15:56.667 --> 15:59.333
Well, if we can't be friends,

16:01.583 --> 16:03.959
then I guess we'll be nothing.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.583
Hey, leave that alone.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.583
Sorry. I was just

16:41.166 --> 16:42.875
turning it down.

16:44.750 --> 16:46.875
- What, you're not a music fan?
- Sure.

16:46.959 --> 16:50.333
It's just, got anything
where a pimp isn't beating his ho?

16:52.917 --> 16:55.834
- I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.
- Oh.

16:56.417 --> 16:59.750
- I'm Julie, Susan Mayer's daughter.
- Oh.

17:01.375 --> 17:04.208
Anyway, I was trying
to do my homework, so...

17:04.291 --> 17:05.792
On a Saturday?

17:05.875 --> 17:08.291
Well, make sure
and take regular breaks

17:08.375 --> 17:10.792
and stop for a sensible dinner.

17:12.208 --> 17:14.959
Just keep it down.
You had it really loud.

17:15.041 --> 17:16.959
That's how I like it.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.792
How do you like it?

17:21.667 --> 17:23.417
You know what?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.125
You're not that hot.

17:35.542 --> 17:36.792
Hey, what you doing?

17:36.875 --> 17:40.375
Oh, I'm working on the seating chart
for Bree's wedding.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.834
- Nora? Who invited her?
- I did.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.667
We need to find her another boyfriend,

17:44.750 --> 17:47.083
and weddings
are crawling with single men.

17:48.542 --> 17:51.041
I hope you're not seating her
next to any of my friends.

17:51.125 --> 17:53.750
- Hey, sacrifices must be made, Tom.
- Look, Jerry Rawlings.

17:53.834 --> 17:54.959
- Not Jerry Rawlings.
- Yes.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.458
She gets her psycho hooks
into Jerry Rawlings,

17:56.542 --> 17:58.083
he will never speak to me again.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.083
Oh, there are other urologists
in the world.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.834
Go back to that other guy.

18:01.917 --> 18:04.875
- The one with the cold hands?
- Oh, it's once a year. Suck it up.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.834
Get a grip, Lynette.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.375
"Get a grip"?

18:09.458 --> 18:11.792
I am hanging on for dear life here.

18:11.875 --> 18:16.333
You are the one that brought
this little problem into our family,

18:16.417 --> 18:21.375
and the only thing I should be hearing
from you is, "How can I help?"

18:21.458 --> 18:23.458
I am also putting
Steve Hanson at her table,

18:23.542 --> 18:27.583
so you might wanna start
shopping around for a new golf buddy.

18:30.959 --> 18:32.417
"Get a grip."

19:10.166 --> 19:12.166
Hi. My name's Susan Mayer.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.917
Your neighbour told me
I could find you here.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.083
Yeah?

19:15.166 --> 19:17.792
Well, I was at my friend Bree's
engagement party the other night,

19:17.875 --> 19:20.500
you know, when you came in
and you did that whole,

19:20.583 --> 19:23.291
"Orson killed his wife" thing.

19:23.375 --> 19:26.333
I was just wondering
if you could elaborate.

19:26.417 --> 19:28.709
He killed her.
What else do you need to know?

19:28.792 --> 19:32.333
Well, what makes you so sure?
Do you have any proof?

19:35.583 --> 19:37.792
Look, I can't talk now. I get off at 6:00.

19:37.875 --> 19:40.542
My friend is marrying that man
in two hours.

19:40.625 --> 19:41.834
Please.

19:43.250 --> 19:47.417
Okay, I need $10 in unrolled pennies,

19:47.500 --> 19:51.709
and I need to see you count it
because last time you stiffed me.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.250
After Alma disappeared,

19:58.333 --> 20:00.208
the police came
and searched the house.

20:00.291 --> 20:03.959
- The police? What did they find?
- Nothing.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.250
- And that's bad why?
- Don't you get it?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.458
When the police showed up,

20:09.542 --> 20:14.083
Orson had scrubbed every
inch of the place clean with bleach.

20:14.166 --> 20:19.041
No fingerprints, no skin cells, no DNA.
It was like Alma had never existed.

20:21.208 --> 20:25.166
Who cleans a house like that
unless he has something to hide?

20:35.041 --> 20:38.000
So, when I left the bank, I called
the detective that worked the case.

20:38.083 --> 20:41.166
And he said that the only reason
Orson was never charged

20:41.250 --> 20:43.125
was because they never found a body.

20:43.208 --> 20:46.458
- So, he was an actual suspect?
- He was the only suspect.

20:46.542 --> 20:50.500
- Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
- Well, you know what we have to do.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.542
That was close.

20:53.625 --> 20:56.041
The florist put three mums
in my bridal bouquet,

20:56.125 --> 20:58.667
but not to worry, crisis averted.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.583
Bree, we have to talk.

21:11.041 --> 21:13.959
Reverend, any word
from the bridal party?

21:14.041 --> 21:16.041
They're still in the bride's room.
You know women.

21:16.125 --> 21:19.083
They're probably in there
fussing about mascara and blush.

21:19.166 --> 21:22.291
He did not hack her up
and dissolve the pieces in acid.

21:22.375 --> 21:23.792
I said it was a theory.

21:23.875 --> 21:26.709
The point is, Alma disappeared
under very suspicious circumstances.

21:26.792 --> 21:28.959
I don't have time for this.
I'm getting married now.

21:29.041 --> 21:31.625
This is your day. You can
push the ceremony back an hour.

21:31.709 --> 21:34.709
Now, get that detective on the phone.
Talk things out with Orson.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.417
I can't talk to Orson.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.625
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

21:39.709 --> 21:43.500
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife killer.

21:43.583 --> 21:46.208
If the three of you
don't drop this right now,

21:46.291 --> 21:47.792
I will never forgive you.

21:47.875 --> 21:51.166
Bree, we are just doing this
because we love you.

21:52.625 --> 21:55.458
But if you can honestly tell us

21:55.542 --> 21:58.625
that you don't have
the slightest doubt...

21:58.709 --> 22:00.834
None whatsoever.

23:06.208 --> 23:10.000
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
together in the sight of God

23:10.083 --> 23:12.917
to join this man and woman in holy...

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Excuse me.
Could you give us just a second?

23:17.083 --> 23:20.041
- Is something wrong?
- I just need a moment.

23:26.333 --> 23:29.625
Before we do this,
there's something I need to ask you.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.500
What?

23:31.583 --> 23:34.125
Did you kill your wife?

23:34.208 --> 23:36.333
Susan talked to that Carolyn woman.

23:36.417 --> 23:39.417
Why didn't you tell me
that the police searched your house?

23:39.500 --> 23:43.458
Because it's embarrassing,
and they didn't find anything.

23:43.542 --> 23:46.542
Is that because you scrubbed
the house so thoroughly?

23:46.625 --> 23:48.917
When I'm upset, I clean.

23:53.041 --> 23:57.875
For God's sake, Bree,
I swear to you, I did not kill my wife.

24:02.834 --> 24:03.917
Okay.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.542
Proceed.

24:12.667 --> 24:16.834
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
together in the sight of God

24:16.959 --> 24:20.625
to join this man and woman
in holy matrimony,

24:20.709 --> 24:22.917
which is an honourable estate...

24:48.917 --> 24:51.583
Hey, look at you, Miss Popular.

24:51.667 --> 24:53.500
So, are you having a good time
over there?

24:53.583 --> 24:54.875
As if.

24:54.959 --> 24:57.709
And I don't know what idiot
stuck me at that table,

24:57.792 --> 25:01.125
but every guy over there
is just a boring stiff.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.834
All of them?
What about Jerry? Jerry's fun.

25:06.375 --> 25:10.208
You mean Mr Fatty Hair Plugs?
Oh, yeah, he's a blast.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.375
How about Steve?

25:14.458 --> 25:16.792
You know what,
I hear his family has money.

25:16.875 --> 25:20.834
Well, then maybe they could all chip in
and buy him some deodorant.

25:20.917 --> 25:25.333
I'm through with those losers.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.

25:25.417 --> 25:27.458
Are you gonna eat that?

25:31.125 --> 25:34.709
- Hey, look at you.
- God, I hate wearing a tux.

25:34.792 --> 25:37.417
On my way in, Bree's Aunt Fern
asked me to park the car.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.875
She's got glaucoma.

25:38.959 --> 25:41.625
To her, you're nothing
but a Hispanic blur.

25:41.709 --> 25:43.583
Let me fix your tie.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
- Hey, you're wearing Mama's pearls.
- Yeah.

25:55.667 --> 25:59.291
Hey, Julie.
Have you met my nephew, Austin?

25:59.375 --> 26:03.500
Yeah, we've met. I just didn't
recognise him with his shirt on.

26:06.834 --> 26:10.458
She couldn't take her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.

26:15.291 --> 26:18.250
- Hi, Edie. Nice party, huh?
- It was.

26:22.417 --> 26:23.583
Perfect.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.125
Well, it's nice to see you two
getting along again.

26:26.208 --> 26:27.750
We've sort of turned a corner.

26:27.834 --> 26:30.291
Really? Does that mean
you're gonna be getting back together?

26:30.375 --> 26:32.125
- God, no.
- Maybe.

26:35.125 --> 26:37.041
Wow, is that shrimp?

26:37.917 --> 26:41.041
What would make you think
I would even consider taking you back?

26:41.125 --> 26:43.208
Well, you invited me to be your date.

26:43.291 --> 26:44.667
Guest, Carlos. I said guest.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.500
Come on, you've been flirting with me
since I came in.

26:46.583 --> 26:47.959
"Here, baby, let me fix your tie."

26:48.041 --> 26:49.333
I mean, for a woman
who's not interested,

26:49.417 --> 26:50.917
you sure are sending
some mixed signals.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.625
You want a clear signal? How's this?

26:57.875 --> 26:59.500
- Ian.
- Susan.

26:59.583 --> 27:01.542
What are you doing here?

27:01.625 --> 27:04.667
Well, my cousin
is Dr Hodge's dental hygienist,

27:04.750 --> 27:06.250
and her husband, he couldn't join her,

27:06.333 --> 27:08.375
since he'd come down
with a spot of impetigo.

27:08.458 --> 27:11.583
So she called me, knowing
how much I love a good garter toss.

27:11.667 --> 27:13.834
- And so...
- Ian.

27:13.917 --> 27:16.375
Yes, I am such a terrible liar.

27:16.458 --> 27:20.083
I mean, impetigo.
Where did that come from?

27:21.208 --> 27:23.792
So, what are you really doing here?

27:24.750 --> 27:29.333
Look, I can't stop thinking about us,

27:29.417 --> 27:31.542
about how great we could be together,

27:31.625 --> 27:33.709
and I think you're making a mistake.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.917
- Ian...
- Susan, please don't go.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
- Can't we at least talk about this?
- I can't.

27:39.083 --> 27:41.667
'Cause I have bridesmaid stuff.

27:46.041 --> 27:47.250
Hi there.

27:47.333 --> 27:51.542
I just wanted to say
you're doing a great job, Tad.

27:51.625 --> 27:54.709
That's such a masculine name.

27:54.792 --> 27:57.166
My boyfriend seems to like it.

27:57.834 --> 27:59.125
Okay, here's the drill.

27:59.208 --> 28:00.625
My ex is here and I wanna piss him off,

28:00.709 --> 28:04.083
so just act like you're all hot for me,
and there's a 100-buck tip in it for you.

28:04.166 --> 28:07.333
Right. So, should I cup your boob?

28:07.417 --> 28:09.041
No, I'll drive.

28:19.750 --> 28:21.542
Tequila. Straight.

28:24.041 --> 28:27.417
Hey, are there any decent
single women at this wedding?

28:27.500 --> 28:29.500
Not that I've seen.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.583
Oh, damn it, not a one.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.291
Hey, Carlos.
You should come over to our table.

28:37.375 --> 28:39.500
That's where all the hotties are.

28:39.583 --> 28:43.291
<i>Hey, everyone. I'd say it is time</i>
<i>that we get Bree and Orson up here</i>

28:43.375 --> 28:45.500
<i>for their first dance</i>
<i>as a married couple.</i>

28:45.583 --> 28:50.458
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I give you Mr and Mrs Orson Hodge.</i>

29:12.417 --> 29:16.583
- Orson, you look so serious.
- I'm trying to remember my steps.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.208
You're upset, aren't you?

29:22.291 --> 29:24.959
You're still thinking about
what I said at the church.

29:25.041 --> 29:26.250
Which part, darling?

29:26.333 --> 29:29.709
The "I do" part
or the "Did you kill your wife?" part?

29:31.417 --> 29:34.125
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.

29:34.208 --> 29:37.125
That's my point. You had to ask.

29:46.208 --> 29:48.959
You are gonna rot in hell for this.

29:49.041 --> 29:52.083
Hey, I just brought
two lost souls together.

29:54.709 --> 29:57.959
Okay, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.

29:58.041 --> 30:02.959
He deserves every bit of crazy
she's gonna rain down on him.

30:05.959 --> 30:09.291
Hell, rot, you.

30:18.166 --> 30:20.375
What are they doing?

30:23.291 --> 30:26.291
Rounding second
and heading for third.

30:31.709 --> 30:32.917
Carlos!

30:32.959 --> 30:34.792
Oh, hey, Gabby.
Look, I made a new friend.

30:34.875 --> 30:38.417
Yes, I've been watching you make
your new friend, and it's disgusting.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.250
Do you mind?
We're trying to dance here.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.834
Who the hell are you, anyway?

30:41.917 --> 30:44.542
And why the hell
are you at this wedding?

30:45.291 --> 30:47.500
This is not gonna end well.

30:48.083 --> 30:50.792
They're just two random people
who met at a wedding.

30:50.875 --> 30:52.917
Can't pin it on me.

30:53.417 --> 30:55.041
It was her.

30:55.917 --> 30:58.250
Lynette Scavo, I wanna talk to you.

31:00.208 --> 31:02.125
I'll see you at home.

31:02.792 --> 31:03.875
What were you thinking?

31:03.959 --> 31:06.792
I didn't invite you here
to embarrass me in front of my friends.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.792
Oh, no, you just wanted me to watch

31:08.875 --> 31:11.458
while you suck the zits
off some teenage waiter.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.709
That's it. I take my invitation back.

31:13.792 --> 31:15.875
You are no longer welcome
in my house.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.875
Fine. I'll go.
Just give me back the pearls.

31:18.959 --> 31:20.500
- No!
- Gabby.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.417
- Carlos, no.
- They were my mama's.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.834
No!

31:25.792 --> 31:28.083
Now look what you've done.

31:29.125 --> 31:30.291
Mrs Solis.

31:30.375 --> 31:32.166
- No, Carlos.
- Give me that.

31:32.250 --> 31:34.291
- Give me those.
- Pardon me, excuse me.

31:34.375 --> 31:35.875
Get away. Those are mine.

31:35.959 --> 31:37.709
- The hell they are.
- Mrs Solis.

31:37.792 --> 31:39.959
- Not now, Xiao Mei.
- Mrs Solis!

31:40.041 --> 31:42.083
Oh, for God's sakes, what?

31:52.125 --> 31:54.917
I think maybe it's time.

32:00.041 --> 32:04.500
<i>And I wish you both</i>
<i>a lifetime of happiness.</i>

32:06.625 --> 32:07.750
<i>Wow.</i>

32:09.125 --> 32:11.583
<i>That was beautiful, Aunt Fern.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

32:11.667 --> 32:14.125
<i>Hey, they mopped up</i>
<i>all the amniotic fluid,</i>

32:14.208 --> 32:16.875
<i>so we should feel safe</i>
<i>to start the conga line.</i>

32:16.959 --> 32:19.750
Actually, I'd like to say a few words.

32:24.291 --> 32:29.291
Bree, Orson,
your love is an inspiration to us all.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.917
That's very sweet.
How do you know him?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.250
I thought he was on your side.

32:36.333 --> 32:38.291
Well, I know this is a second wedding
for both of you,

32:38.375 --> 32:41.041
and I think you're jolly brave.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.959
So often people find excuses
not to fall in love again.

32:44.041 --> 32:45.583
They're afraid.

32:46.583 --> 32:49.000
But it's rare to find somebody
that you connect with,

32:49.083 --> 32:52.583
so when you do,
you have to follow your heart.

32:52.667 --> 32:56.291
Bree, Orson, I salute you.

32:57.583 --> 32:59.834
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Let's get the music cranking and...</i>

32:59.917 --> 33:02.750
Actually, Tom,
could you just hang on a second?

33:02.834 --> 33:05.834
I also would like to say a few words.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.542
To Bree and Orson.

33:07.625 --> 33:10.625
Yes, what could be better
than a second love?

33:10.709 --> 33:14.041
And this time, you enter into it
a little older, a little wiser.

33:14.125 --> 33:18.917
But also, and this is key,
with a bit of caution.

33:20.834 --> 33:26.166
Because while love can be
spontaneous and wonderful,

33:26.250 --> 33:29.083
it can also be selfish.

33:29.166 --> 33:33.375
And sometimes, the best thing
you can do is just to walk away.

33:39.583 --> 33:43.500
Not you two.
I mean, you two crazy kids are great.

33:43.583 --> 33:45.291
Congrats. Yeah.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.834
<i>- Well, then, let's...</i>
- Hang on.

33:46.917 --> 33:49.375
I'd like to respond to that toast.

33:49.458 --> 33:54.500
Bree, Orson, sometimes walking away
can seem the best choice.

33:54.583 --> 33:55.792
It's certainly the safest.

33:55.875 --> 33:59.458
But what do you do
when you find someone

33:59.542 --> 34:03.375
who makes you feel joy when
you thought you never would again?

34:04.375 --> 34:06.417
Do you just let them go?

34:09.208 --> 34:10.291
No.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.709
No, I can't do that.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.166
<i>You wanna...</i>

34:28.959 --> 34:30.041
No.

34:31.041 --> 34:32.333
I'm good.

34:33.208 --> 34:35.500
<i>All right, then, let's dance.</i>

34:49.875 --> 34:53.291
Well, I thought you might need
a change of clothes.

34:54.250 --> 34:56.750
Yeah, you're still mad at me, huh?

34:56.834 --> 34:59.542
What were you thinking,
setting Carlos up with that skank?

34:59.625 --> 35:03.750
I am sorry. I was desperate.
I had a little too much to drink.

35:03.834 --> 35:05.458
And you are divorcing Carlos.

35:05.542 --> 35:07.875
No, Lynette,
Carlos will never be fair game.

35:07.959 --> 35:10.291
- You know the rules.
- You're right.

35:10.375 --> 35:13.500
You are right. You're right. I'm so sorry.

35:15.291 --> 35:16.834
It's just...

35:19.041 --> 35:20.250
What?

35:21.834 --> 35:23.959
I'm so unhappy.

35:24.083 --> 35:27.041
Ever since that woman
pushed her way into our lives,

35:27.125 --> 35:29.500
I can't even work up a smile.

35:29.583 --> 35:32.125
And the more she pushes,
the more I resent Tom.

35:32.208 --> 35:35.125
Tom, for something he did
12 years ago.

35:35.208 --> 35:38.750
And I'm afraid if I can't fix this,

35:38.834 --> 35:42.250
that the anger's
just gonna fester until...

35:42.333 --> 35:47.291
Lynette, listen to me.
You and Tom will survive this.

35:47.375 --> 35:52.166
No, seriously, Gabby.
I am so tired of pretending to smile.

35:52.250 --> 35:56.041
You and Tom will survive this.

35:56.125 --> 35:59.333
Yeah? How can you be so sure?

35:59.417 --> 36:02.375
Because some marriages
were built to last.

36:04.250 --> 36:06.000
And some aren't.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.667
Trust me, I know the difference.

36:20.375 --> 36:22.917
I'm looking for Bree Van De Kamp.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.333
Could you excuse me
for just a minute?

36:30.083 --> 36:32.083
Orson, congratulations.

36:34.041 --> 36:36.667
Excuse me.
Are you Mrs Van De Kamp?

36:36.750 --> 36:39.166
It's Hodge now.

36:39.250 --> 36:41.583
Yes, I'm terribly sorry
to barge in like this,

36:41.667 --> 36:43.875
but we need your husband
to come down to the morgue.

36:43.959 --> 36:46.542
We may have found his wife's body.

36:57.959 --> 36:59.792
Push, Xiao Mei, push.

37:02.208 --> 37:05.125
Okay, okay. Deep breaths now.
We're getting close.

37:05.208 --> 37:08.625
It's time.
I can't believe this is happening.

37:08.709 --> 37:11.166
Honey, I'm gonna cry.

37:11.250 --> 37:14.875
- Carlos, I am so sorry about the...
- Me, too, me, too.

37:14.959 --> 37:17.709
- I was way out of line.
- No, I forgive you.

37:18.333 --> 37:22.458
It's worth it when you experience
a moment as beautiful as this.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.709
Okay, I can see the head now.

37:24.792 --> 37:27.000
Oh, get the camera! Get the camera!

37:33.625 --> 37:35.125
Oh, my God.

37:47.709 --> 37:50.917
Oh, man, I gotta get the colour
fixed on this thing.

38:00.583 --> 38:02.125
How could this have happened?

38:02.208 --> 38:04.583
What kind of half-assed fertility clinic
are you running?

38:04.667 --> 38:05.792
Prior to implantation,

38:05.875 --> 38:09.625
your embryo was accidentally switched
with another client's.

38:09.709 --> 38:13.041
So if we got theirs and they got ours,
then it's possible...

38:13.125 --> 38:15.583
Now, I'm afraid your embryo
didn't take.

38:15.667 --> 38:18.458
Again, on behalf of the clinic,
I am so sorry.

38:18.542 --> 38:21.500
- It's rare, but these things do happen.
- Excuse me.

38:21.583 --> 38:23.834
You screw up our lives
and the best you can do is,

38:23.917 --> 38:25.709
"That's the way the cookie crumbles"?

38:25.792 --> 38:26.917
And who is this guy?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.417
Why is he writing down
everything I say?

38:28.500 --> 38:29.959
This is Mr Darby, our attorney.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.083
We thought it wise
to have him present.

38:32.166 --> 38:34.000
You know what else
would have been wise?

38:34.083 --> 38:36.917
Sticking the right baby
in the right belly.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.834
Mrs Solis, please.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.083
That's not Alma.

39:09.917 --> 39:12.083
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

39:12.875 --> 39:14.208
Thank God.

39:19.750 --> 39:22.083
Carolyn. What is she doing here?

39:22.166 --> 39:26.125
You didn't honestly think
they'd take your word for it, did you?

39:32.542 --> 39:34.083
It's not her.

39:35.834 --> 39:39.375
Well, that's it, then.
Sorry for wasting your time.

39:39.458 --> 39:40.917
This means nothing.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.667
I'm telling you,
that man is as guilty as sin.

39:43.750 --> 39:47.458
We know what you think.
Now, would you please leave us alone?

39:47.542 --> 39:50.083
He's a cold-blooded killer.

39:50.166 --> 39:51.792
He's kind and decent,

39:51.875 --> 39:54.291
and nothing you could say
will ever make me doubt him again.

39:54.375 --> 39:56.083
Now, please go.

40:02.959 --> 40:05.875
- You deserve him.
- I hope to.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.709
Darling, I am so sorry
you had to endure that.

40:13.792 --> 40:15.750
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

40:15.834 --> 40:19.458
Let's just go back to our guests
and forget any of this ever happened.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.834
All right.

40:29.083 --> 40:30.917
<i>Tu me manques, Monique.</i>

40:44.750 --> 40:47.542
- Well.
- Yeah.

40:49.458 --> 40:52.709
- I feel so...
- Me, too.

40:57.083 --> 40:59.792
Well, you know what the good news is.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.750
What's that?

41:02.792 --> 41:06.875
Now that there's no baby,
it'll make the divorce a lot simpler.

41:09.917 --> 41:11.917
Yeah, that's something.

41:13.959 --> 41:15.291
So...

41:17.875 --> 41:20.000
See you at the mediator's.

41:21.291 --> 41:22.834
See you then.

41:38.542 --> 41:41.083
<i>Have you met the perfect couple?</i>

41:42.500 --> 41:46.834
<i>The two soul mates</i>
<i>whose love never dies?</i>

41:49.250 --> 41:54.333
<i>The two lovers whose relationship</i>
<i>is never threatened?</i>

41:56.583 --> 42:00.875
<i>The husband and wife</i>
<i>who trust each other completely?</i>

42:02.417 --> 42:07.417
<i>If you haven't met the perfect couple,</i>
<i>let me introduce you.</i>

42:08.834 --> 42:13.375
<i>They stand atop</i>
<i>a layer of butter cream frosting.</i>

42:13.458 --> 42:16.083
<i>The secret of their success?</i>

42:16.166 --> 42:21.542
<i>Well, for starters,</i>
<i>they don't have to look at each other.</i>
