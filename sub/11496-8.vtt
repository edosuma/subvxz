WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:04.403
Morning.

00:04.405 --> 00:05.270
Morning.

00:05.272 --> 00:07.973
Ooh, cap'n crunch.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.542
That's the only man
I put in my mouth.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.779
It puts my relationship
with orville redenbacher

00:13.781 --> 00:15.481
In a whole different light.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.952
I'm partial to the u.P.S. Guy.

00:19.954 --> 00:22.621
We're making food jokes here.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.623
The u.P.S. Guy's not food.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.825
He is if you cover him
with whipped cream.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.195
What can I say?

00:30.197 --> 00:33.499
There's just something
about a man in brown shorts.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.967
Okay, I'm in big trouble.

00:34.969 --> 00:37.503
Speaking of a man
with brown shorts.

00:38.772 --> 00:39.905
What's wrong?

00:39.907 --> 00:40.906
Well, I just got a call

00:40.908 --> 00:41.907
From lyndsey's boyfriend larry.

00:41.909 --> 00:42.975
And he wants to see me.

00:42.977 --> 00:44.510
Well, he wants
to see jeff strongman.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.311
Who's jeff strongman?

00:46.313 --> 00:48.047
Oh, jeff strongman

00:48.049 --> 00:50.215
Is alan's alter ego he uses

00:50.217 --> 00:52.518
To meet larry and fight crime.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.623
Wait, so, you use a fake name
to sneak around with other men?

00:59.626 --> 01:02.327
Where do you guys meet?
A lady gaga concert?

01:02.329 --> 01:05.898
It was a spin class
if you must know.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.433
Now, what am I gonna do?

01:07.435 --> 01:09.334
I told you something
like this was gonna happen.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.037
(mocking):
"I told you something like this
was gonna happen."

01:12.039 --> 01:14.740
Look, I am serious-- he wouldn't
tell me why he wanted to see me

01:14.742 --> 01:15.874
And he sounded pretty upset.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.676
Well, what kind of world
are we living in

01:17.678 --> 01:19.845
Where a guy is upset
with another guy

01:19.847 --> 01:22.047
For banging his girlfriend?

01:23.116 --> 01:24.650
See, that's why
I love being gay.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.019
A guy finds out
I'm doing his girlfriend,

01:27.021 --> 01:28.587
I don't get an angry phone call.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.091
I get a dozen roses
and a copy of the video.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.395
Too bad I can't convince
larry I'm gay.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.897
Come on, zippy, you're making it
too easy for us.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.706
Oh, hey!

01:47.708 --> 01:48.707
There he is.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.876
My main man with a winter tan.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.811
Jeff.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.013
Uh, I got you a coffee.
Can I get you anything else?

01:55.015 --> 01:56.615
Uh, one-one of these muffins?
They're bran.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.883
Keeps your trains
running on time.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.585
Poop-poop!

01:59.587 --> 02:01.320
I'm not hungry.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.422
All right then, I'll just
sit across from you.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.257
Right here...

02:05.259 --> 02:07.493
In front
of all these witnesses.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.228
You know my girlfriend lyndsey?

02:09.230 --> 02:10.229
Is it lyndsey?

02:10.231 --> 02:11.563
I thought it was linda.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.465
Glad you cleared that up
before I saw her again...

02:13.467 --> 02:15.667
Which I haven't,
and why would I?

02:15.669 --> 02:16.835
She's been cheating on me.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.905
(hacking)

02:19.907 --> 02:21.573
Mmm, sorry.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.642
Just a little...
(clears throat)

02:23.644 --> 02:25.744
Why do you think
she's cheating on you?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.412
I hired a private investigator
to follow her.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.882
(hacking)

02:29.884 --> 02:32.818
Uh, do you mind?

02:32.820 --> 02:34.720
She's been meeting him
at a house in malibu.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.591
Sorry, sorry,
I'm just a little shocked.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.160
Imagine how I feel.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.228
Well, I-I can't,
uh, uh, but I do know

02:43.230 --> 02:46.098
That in situations like this,
it's the woman who's to blame.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.734
She's not the only one.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.003
Please, I have a son!

02:51.005 --> 02:52.871
This is the guy.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.241
Wait, this is the guy?

02:56.243 --> 02:58.210
Yeah.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.045
This is guy you think
banging your girlfriend?

03:00.047 --> 03:01.079
I know he is.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.414
And only him?

03:02.416 --> 03:03.415
Nobody else?

03:03.417 --> 03:04.783
Isn't this bad enough?

03:04.785 --> 03:08.053
Well, sure.

03:08.055 --> 03:10.856
But, you know, there could
also be another explanation.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.524
I mean, maybe she's just lost

03:12.526 --> 03:14.159
And she's asking
this guy for directions.

03:14.161 --> 03:17.362
Right, "excuse me, sir,
can you help me find my g-spot?"

03:18.331 --> 03:20.199
It's not just this photo.

03:20.201 --> 03:22.000
It's the late night errands.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.268
Hiding her phone.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.870
Plus, we haven't had sex
in forever!

03:24.872 --> 03:26.572
Wow, that's rough.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.274
I guess this guy, whoever he is,

03:29.276 --> 03:32.778
Satisfies her every need.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.046
I want to kill him.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.948
I hate being
lied to like this.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.282
I get it, you know.

03:37.284 --> 03:40.219
Sometimes you think you know
a person, but you don't.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.087
Panini for strongman.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.358
Jeff, that's you.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.426
What?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.094
Oh, oh, yeah, that's me.

03:50.663 --> 03:52.431
Jeff strongman.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.167
Someone who's not banging
anyone's girlfriend.

03:55.169 --> 03:58.170
♪ men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

03:58.172 --> 04:00.839
♪ ah.
♪ men.
♪ men.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.623
Oh, no, there's a stranger
in my house.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.792
And it's possibly
a gay porn star from the '70s.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.328
It's me, alan.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.997
I-I believe you're
supposed to say,

04:24.999 --> 04:26.999
(italian accent):
"it's-a me, a-mario!"

04:29.902 --> 04:33.105
So, I take it things
didn't go great with larry?

04:33.107 --> 04:35.073
Well, he does know
that lyndsey's cheating on him,

04:35.075 --> 04:37.242
But the good news is he doesn't
know that it's with me.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.177
So, why do you look

04:39.179 --> 04:42.080
Like one of the village people
in street clothes?

04:42.082 --> 04:44.149
Ah, well, uh, he hired
a, uh, a private detective,

04:44.151 --> 04:46.351
Uh, to watch
the house because, uh,

04:46.353 --> 04:48.153
And here's where it gets
really funny,

04:48.155 --> 04:49.588
Um, uh,

04:49.590 --> 04:52.958
He thinks that lyndsey is
cheating on him with...

04:52.960 --> 04:54.293
No.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.863
No, no, no.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.065
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:00.067 --> 05:02.134
It's crazy, right?

05:03.236 --> 05:05.237
Why didn't you
tell him the truth?

05:05.239 --> 05:08.240
Fear, cowardice.

05:08.242 --> 05:09.708
Lack of a dental plan.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.878
Uh, besides, he-he
just lost lyndsey,

05:12.880 --> 05:14.279
I didn't want him to
lose his best friend.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.781
Okay, well, you're gonna lose
your best friend

05:15.783 --> 05:17.082
If you don't fix this!

05:17.084 --> 05:19.084
Oh, I'm your best friend?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.452
Alan, I am serious.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.754
I do not want a private
detective watching this house.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.723
And I...
And I definitely don't want

05:24.725 --> 05:26.792
An angry boyfriend after me.

05:26.794 --> 05:27.793
Well, you should've
thought of that

05:27.795 --> 05:30.362
Before you slept with lyndsey.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.597
I've got some work to do.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.399
And I'm gonna go out
and run some errands.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.768
And when I get back,
this better be cleaned up.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.270
Oh, oh, don't worry, I'm on it.

05:38.272 --> 05:40.005
Oh, oh, but just in case.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.677
Oh, god!

05:45.679 --> 05:47.946
Is there any look
you can't pull off?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.682
(italian accent):
I'm-a gonna kill you.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.154
Hey!

05:56.156 --> 05:57.089
Hi-ya!

05:57.091 --> 05:58.390
Oh!

05:59.559 --> 06:00.959
What the hell?

06:00.961 --> 06:03.362
Alan, what are you doing?

06:03.364 --> 06:06.865
At the moment,
looking for my left ball.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.667
Larry just dropped me off.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.168
He could've seen you.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.470
That's why I'm here.
Larry thinks you're

06:11.472 --> 06:13.071
Having an affair with walden.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.873
What? Why would he think that?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.074
Well, because he he hired a p.I.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.076
Who got a picture of the two
of you together.

06:18.078 --> 06:21.179
And by the way, it looked
like it was a cold day.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.848
You're an idiot.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.849
I know.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.150
So, what-what are we gonna do?

06:25.152 --> 06:28.420
Okay, look, I've done this
plenty of times before.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.922
The first thing you do
is deny everything.

06:30.924 --> 06:31.990
Right, denial. Wait.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.258
You've done this
plenty of times before?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.060
Did you ever cheat on me?

06:35.062 --> 06:37.062
Never.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.730
Okay, good.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.865
(phone chirps)
oh!

06:39.867 --> 06:41.666
Oh, it's larry.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.501
What does he want?

06:42.503 --> 06:43.668
Uh, well, let's see.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.404
Uh, "just dropped off
the cheating whor...

06:45.406 --> 06:46.671
Lyndsey."

06:48.040 --> 06:48.874
"want to grab a drink?"

06:48.876 --> 06:49.941
Okay, you go play

06:49.943 --> 06:51.576
The sympathetic friend,
calm him down.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.878
I'll figure something out.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.279
Sounds good, uh...

06:54.281 --> 06:55.847
"no problem, bro."

06:55.849 --> 06:56.982
Uh...

06:56.984 --> 06:59.584
Cocktail glass emoji.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.053
Stall him as long as you can.

07:02.055 --> 07:02.954
Right.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.055
I'm sorry I kicked you

07:04.057 --> 07:05.791
In the balls--
is there anything I can do?

07:05.793 --> 07:08.393
You could kiss it
and make it better.

07:08.395 --> 07:09.594
Good-bye, alan.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.363
Oh, come on!

07:11.365 --> 07:13.432
It's not like I
could do it myself.

07:15.101 --> 07:19.004
God knows I've tried.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.907
(tires screeching)

07:21.909 --> 07:24.075
Get in the car!
Rose?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.110
What are you doing?

07:25.112 --> 07:26.611
Someone's following you.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.713
Yeah, you!

07:28.715 --> 07:31.750
There's no time for this,
you're in danger.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.819
Yeah, from you!

07:33.821 --> 07:35.253
Just get in.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.488
Why would I get in your car?

07:36.490 --> 07:37.489
I mean, the last time

07:37.491 --> 07:39.224
I tried to trust you...

07:39.226 --> 07:40.759
What? What are you looking at?

07:40.761 --> 07:43.462
You got a little spot
on your shirt.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.930
Oh.

07:44.932 --> 07:45.931
(screams)

07:45.933 --> 07:48.200
Drive! Drive! Drive!

07:48.202 --> 07:51.169
Drive! Drive!

07:51.171 --> 07:53.004
I found out more
about this guy.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.273
His name is
walden schmidt.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.209
More like lying sack of schmidt.

07:57.211 --> 07:59.678
(chuckles)
am I right?

07:59.680 --> 08:02.848
Turns out he's some kind
of stupid internet billionaire.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.015
Don't you hate
when guys don't work

08:04.017 --> 08:05.150
For a living like you and me?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.886
Amen, jeff strongman.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.387
Hey, come on, you know,

08:09.389 --> 08:10.589
This isn't the worst thing
in the world.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.890
You're gonna bounce back.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.892
I guess, I mean,
I should've seen it coming.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.328
I mean, she cheated
on her last boyfriend with me.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.030
Her-her last boyfriend?

08:19.032 --> 08:21.066
Yeah, I guess the guy
was a real loser.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.468
A pathetic freeloader.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.204
Well, that's just conjecture.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.673
I mean, you know, maybe
he's a-a really great guy

08:28.675 --> 08:31.977
And she's just
a crazy lying bitch.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.144
I'm not gonna take it lying down

08:33.146 --> 08:34.880
Like the pansy
she was dating before me.

08:34.882 --> 08:38.416
Is "pansy" your word or hers?

08:38.418 --> 08:39.184
Hers.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.185
I'm going to the head.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.253
You get the check

08:41.255 --> 08:43.021
And we'll go pay
this bastard a visit.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.523
Take your time.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.624
No rush.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.796
Oh, come on, lyndsey,
pick up, pick up, pick up!

08:51.798 --> 08:54.866
(groans)
of course, voice mail.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.035
Lyndsey, things have gone
from bad to worse.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.304
Larry is gonna confront walden,
and I don't know what to do.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.472
Call me back.

09:00.474 --> 09:01.740
Oh, and ps-- you and I have

09:01.742 --> 09:04.009
A little issue
to discuss ourselves.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.811
Oh, and pps--
the "p" stands for "pansy."

09:06.813 --> 09:08.680
Mm-hmm.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.448
Whew.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.917
Looks like we lost him.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.486
What the hell is going on?

09:14.488 --> 09:17.656
Well, I'm pretty sure
larry hired a hit man.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.190
How do you know about larry?

09:19.192 --> 09:20.792
Because he's stalking you.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.460
How do you know that?

09:22.462 --> 09:24.796
Because I'm stalking you.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.431
Okay, okay, you know,
this is ridiculous.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.732
I'm calling the police.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.668
And tell them what?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.836
We have no proof
of anything.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.338
And besides, how helpful
were the police

09:33.340 --> 09:34.606
When you called them on me?

09:34.608 --> 09:37.208
Uh, I got them to issue
a restraining order.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.210
Hi.

09:40.846 --> 09:42.180
Okay, I...

09:42.182 --> 09:43.882
Uh-oh, he's back.

09:43.884 --> 09:47.052
I don't know how he
keeps finding us.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.753
I'll tell you how.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.689
The gps on my cell phone.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.990
Give me that.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.729
I was gonna turn it off,
but okay.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.863
Hang on.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.131
What? Why?

10:00.133 --> 10:03.168
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(squealing)

10:03.170 --> 10:05.136
Whoa!

10:05.138 --> 10:06.304
(sighs)

10:06.306 --> 10:07.305
That ought to do it.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.375
Okay, you know...
This is nonsense!

10:10.377 --> 10:11.810
(stammers)
take me home.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.279
Okay, homeward bound.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.480
And gagged.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.848
And tortured for days.

10:16.850 --> 10:20.085
Okay, well, fine,
then take me to a hotel.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.586
Beverly hills hotel okay?

10:21.588 --> 10:22.587
It's perfect.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.222
And bang, you're dead.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.257
You need to get
off the grid.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.759
Someplace they
don't expect you.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.095
A place they can't track
your credit cards.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.764
Nobody is tracking
my credit cards.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.934
Oh, that wasn't you last night
getting a coffee colonic?

10:36.902 --> 10:40.605
I will not apologize
for a healthy colon.

10:45.511 --> 10:47.545
Okay, here we go.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.280
This place looks perfect.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.349
This place is a dump.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.352
Exactly, and it's the last place
anyone would look for you.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.021
Yeah, but it's the first place

10:56.023 --> 10:58.256
That hepatitis
would look for me.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.392
Okay, this is only temporary.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.694
You lay low,
and I will straighten this out.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.829
Why in god's name
would I trust you?

11:04.831 --> 11:06.765
Look, walden, I know
that I've caused you

11:06.767 --> 11:08.633
Some tiny problems
in the past, but...

11:08.635 --> 11:09.934
Wha...? Tiny?

11:09.936 --> 11:11.236
You pretended to be pregnant

11:11.238 --> 11:12.704
To scare my girlfriend away.

11:12.706 --> 11:16.675
You sicced rabid ferrets on me!

11:16.677 --> 11:19.844
You tied me to my bed
and tried to violate me

11:19.846 --> 11:21.880
With a leaf blower!

11:23.015 --> 11:26.618
It's so sweet you
remember everything.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.853
But I can make up
for all of that now.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.390
Look, when your sink is clogged,
you call a plumber.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.926
When your car breaks down,
you call a mechanic.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.995
When you have a dangerous
psychopath after you,

11:36.997 --> 11:39.064
You call me.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.432
All right, fine.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.033
I am gonna kill alan.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.003
Oh, if you survive tonight,
you should hire larry's guy.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.337
He's good.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.907
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

11:51.210 --> 11:53.578
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

11:53.580 --> 11:55.647
Here you go.

11:58.584 --> 12:01.219
This is, uh, this is
the best room you got?

12:01.221 --> 12:03.288
It's the presidential suite.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.790
The president of what?

12:05.792 --> 12:07.792
Crap-o-slovakia?

12:07.794 --> 12:09.661
I could offer you
the honeymoon suite.

12:09.663 --> 12:12.864
You know, if you don't mind
the smell of love.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.468
No, no... This is, uh...

12:16.470 --> 12:17.702
This is fine.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.437
Uh...

12:19.439 --> 12:21.840
Do you, uh, do you
have room service?

12:24.543 --> 12:26.611
I might have something
you might want to eat.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.682
I don't think you do.

12:33.486 --> 12:37.322
Listen, uh, if-if anyone
comes here asking about me,

12:37.324 --> 12:38.823
I-I'm not here.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.091
Don't worry.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.160
No one will ever find you.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.503
Hey, uh, if you get
lonely later on,

12:51.505 --> 12:53.571
I'm in the apartment
behind the building.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.807
Yeah, okay.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.209
It's nothing fancy,
but I've got some good weed

12:58.211 --> 13:01.646
And... A spa tub.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.949
I'll, uh, keep that in mind.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.818
There's a live feed
on channel 14

13:06.820 --> 13:08.353
If you want to check it out.

13:13.392 --> 13:14.692
(door closes)

13:14.694 --> 13:17.662
Great, now I got
to hide from him, too.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.335
This walden guy is gonna regret
the day he stole my girlfriend.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.704
Oh, it's-it's not stealing.
It-it's more like borrowing.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.606
Like-like renting a car.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.275
Yeah, but when you rent a car
you know there's been

13:30.277 --> 13:32.744
Other guys inside it,
turning the knobs,

13:32.746 --> 13:34.012
Playing with the seat,

13:34.014 --> 13:35.680
Shoving stuff in the trunk.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.949
Okay, okay, maybe that's
a bad analogy.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.684
But that doesn't change
the fact that going over there

13:39.686 --> 13:41.820
To confront him is not
gonna help anything.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.121
You got a better idea?

13:43.123 --> 13:44.189
Uh, I-I do.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.857
How about you forget
about lyndsey

13:45.859 --> 13:48.159
And we go out to a bar
and pick up some women.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.228
You know, larry and jeff
out on the prowl.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.963
(growls)

13:51.965 --> 13:54.065
Jeff, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.500
But I'm afraid
if I don't do this,

13:55.502 --> 13:57.902
I won't be able
to live with myself.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.638
And I'm afraid if you do this,

14:00.640 --> 14:03.274
I'll have to live by myself.

14:04.743 --> 14:06.811
(indistinct chatter on tv)

14:09.181 --> 14:11.749
Oh, no! Channel 14!

14:20.059 --> 14:22.060
Oh, god!

14:22.062 --> 14:23.461
(knocking)

14:24.363 --> 14:26.464
Who is it?

14:26.466 --> 14:29.100
(deep voice):
It's larry, I'm here
to kill you, walden.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.469
Mr. Walden, he die.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.905
I clean room.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.707
Rose:
No, silly rabbit, it's just me.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.475
Wha...? Rose?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.878
Is that...?

14:39.880 --> 14:41.446
Are you alone?

14:41.448 --> 14:45.316
Yeah, but a nice man did just
invite me into his spa tub.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.721
Here, I brought some food.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.955
Yeah, I can't eat.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.056
Why not?

14:52.058 --> 14:53.524
Well, because if I do,

14:53.526 --> 14:55.193
Eventually
I'll have to go in there.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.097
And I'm not going in there.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.199
Uh, so, did you find
anything out?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.635
Still no sign of larry.
He could be anywhere.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.670
God, alan was supposed
to take care of this.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.472
Well, yeah, he also told you
he was only gonna live

15:07.474 --> 15:11.309
At your house a few days, and
here we are at day 800 and...

15:11.311 --> 15:13.144
43.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.079
Oh, I almost forgot.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.881
I got us some candy bars.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.183
Mounds for you,
'cause it's your favorite.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.218
Aw.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.219
Almond joy for me

15:21.221 --> 15:23.621
'cause, you know... Nuts.

15:25.691 --> 15:28.426
Hey, why are you being
so nice to me?

15:28.428 --> 15:31.562
You know,
I'll admit that you hurt me.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.866
And I did some things
that I'm not proud of.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.702
But just because
you took a restraining order

15:37.704 --> 15:39.637
Out against me...

15:39.639 --> 15:43.541
Doesn't mean that I can
restrain my feelings for you.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.576
That is the sweetest,

15:45.578 --> 15:48.046
Most terrifying thing

15:48.048 --> 15:49.914
I've ever heard.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.118
Are you really
scared of me?

15:54.120 --> 15:57.622
You're not even the scariest
person I've met in this room.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.860
And the truth is,
I'm-I'm not blameless.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.529
I mean, I chose
another girl over you,

16:04.531 --> 16:08.399
And look who's here
with me now?

16:09.068 --> 16:11.836
I never really left you.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.606
Literally.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.546
File this under things
I'm gonna regret.

16:25.951 --> 16:28.987
Damn it, should've
brought my leaf blower.

16:36.228 --> 16:38.062
Oh, uh,
the doorbell doesn't work.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.964
What?

16:39.966 --> 16:41.933
I mean, uh,
that-that does not work

16:41.935 --> 16:45.003
If you want to send a message
that there's a man here.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.405
♪ ding-dong.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.906
"I'm gonna kick your tushie."

16:48.908 --> 16:51.309
You're right.
Yeah.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.844
Oh.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.846
Okay, now, listen,
now-now, this could get crazy.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.781
I mean, there's gonna be
a lot of name calling--

16:56.783 --> 16:58.850
Uh, uh, jerk, uh, idiot,
uh, alan.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.184
Uh...

17:01.353 --> 17:03.121
Larry?
Lyndsey?

17:03.123 --> 17:06.524
I know exactly what's going on
between you and walden schmidt.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.292
Now, where is he?

17:08.294 --> 17:10.895
Wow! This house
is amazing.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.367
Larry, this isn't
what you think.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.869
It's exactly what I think.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.070
I have pictures.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.772
We're standing in his house!

17:20.774 --> 17:22.974
Okay, it-it's time for me
to tell you the truth.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.676
Don't believe her!
She's a cheating, drunk whore!

17:28.447 --> 17:29.881
Larry, listen to me.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.916
I'm not here to sleep
with walden schmidt.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.618
I'm here to sleep
with someone else.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.019
What?!
What?!

17:36.021 --> 17:37.188
Remember you told me

17:37.190 --> 17:39.390
Your fantasy was
to see me with another woman?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.459
Yeah?
Yeah?

17:42.628 --> 17:44.562
I've arranged for your dream
to come true.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.863
You did?!
You did?!

17:45.865 --> 17:48.666
Yes, that's why I rented
this beautiful beach house

17:48.668 --> 17:51.269
From walden schmidt
as a birthday surprise.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.805
I also got us something else.

17:53.807 --> 17:56.874
So, which one is watching us?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.577
If it's him, I'm gonna
have to charge extra.

18:02.047 --> 18:03.648
Wait a minute.
Is this for real?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.650
Happy birthday, baby.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.652
Wow. Wow.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.253
(laughs)
a threesome.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.755
That is quite
a gift.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.757
Well, it was last minute,

18:12.759 --> 18:15.093
And I had to think of something.

18:15.095 --> 18:18.596
A nice cardigan wouldn't
have done the trick?

18:18.598 --> 18:19.864
God, I feel so stupid.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.599
I even hired someone
to follow you.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.267
Well, why don't you
call them off,

18:23.269 --> 18:24.702
And we'll all go sit down

18:24.704 --> 18:27.071
And talk about the things
you want to see?

18:27.073 --> 18:29.440
Bye, jeff.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.641
Yeah, bye, jeff.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.677
I'll send you a
copy of the video.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.179
Wait. Thi-thi...
Wait. This is

18:35.181 --> 18:36.347
Really... Happening?

18:36.349 --> 18:38.182
I mean, you-you-you
and-and-and her?

18:38.184 --> 18:40.251
And-and... And him?

18:40.253 --> 18:42.353
And-and-and here?

18:42.355 --> 18:44.522
While... While I...?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.858
Son of a bitch!

18:46.860 --> 18:48.226
(mutters)

18:48.228 --> 18:49.393
This is crazy.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.661
You know, I'll...
I'll bet

18:50.663 --> 18:52.597
If lyndsey had been sleeping
with somebody else,

18:52.599 --> 18:56.033
He'd be really, really mad.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.835
I know.
Isn't this great, jeff?

18:57.837 --> 19:00.304
She's not a cheating whore.
She's just a whore.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.274
Hi. It's larry martin.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.177
Oh, hey.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.379
Listen, I'm not going to be
needing your services anymore,

19:08.381 --> 19:09.747
But I appreciate all your help.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.282
No problem.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.517
It was my pleasure.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.485
Good-bye.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.955
That was alan.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.123
What did he say?

19:19.125 --> 19:23.461
Well, he, uh, thanked me
for protecting you.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.096
But there's still no sign
of larry.

19:25.098 --> 19:27.431
And as long as he's out there,
you're not safe.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.300
I'm gonna go get us
some supplies.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.701
No, don't go!

19:30.703 --> 19:32.236
We're having a good time.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.672
You're just a sticky
little honey bun, aren't you?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.974
Now, don't try
to get in touch with anyone,

19:36.976 --> 19:38.743
Or larry will kill you.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.913
Kisses.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.981
(sighs)

19:46.251 --> 19:48.519
I got to go to the bathroom.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.558
Screw it.
I'll just pee the bed.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.597
(thunder rumbling)

19:59.599 --> 20:01.432
(heavy footsteps)

20:04.069 --> 20:05.803
Rose?

20:05.805 --> 20:08.139
(loud jangling of keys)

20:08.141 --> 20:09.540
All right, come on, rose.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.809
This... This...
It's not funny.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.045
(thunder crackling)

20:16.048 --> 20:18.115
Larry?!

20:19.351 --> 20:22.119
Listen, we can... We can...
We can work this out!

20:22.121 --> 20:24.255
It's-it's just
a little misunderstanding.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.656
(door rattling)

20:25.658 --> 20:27.291
Oh, god! I...

20:27.293 --> 20:29.360
(door rattling loudly)

20:35.567 --> 20:37.568
Well, that was rude.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.737
Looks like I took a shower
for nothing.
