00:01.000 --> 00:04.777
5112455771: Cannot a man love two women?
DEMELZ4:
I tn/nk he loves Elizabeth better.

00:04.960 --> 00:06.985
ROSS: To the Poldarks.
- And Wheal Grace.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.377
Aagh!

00:11.080 --> 00:13.583
- Are you stalking me, Dr Enys?
- Not at all.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.942
DWIGHT: I am a gentleman, sir.
- And she is an heiress.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.542
I ask you to marry me.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.585
Don't go there tonight.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.421
Get out of my way.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.266
I love him to_ distraction
and Will marry hIm next month.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.781
DEMELZA: Do you not want her?
- I don't know.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.599
He's left me with only one possible choice.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.142
I thought you should know
that he has joined the naw.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.107
- I'm going to war.
- So, these are our last few hours.

00:41.280 --> 00:46.183
My true and abiding love is for you.
She will never come between us again.

00:46.360 --> 00:50.239
In the summer, Elizabeth gives
birth to a Warleggan heir.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.300
unless it Comes sooner.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.140
(Gulls cry)

01:12.600 --> 01:13.783
(Gasps)

01:28.920 --> 01:30.899
(Horse whinnies in distance)

01:32.640 --> 01:34.187
(She cries out)

01:39.040 --> 01:41.144
- (Gasps)
- (Horse whinnies)

01:44.680 --> 01:45.863
Elizabeth!

01:56.520 --> 01:57.987
- Are you hurt?
- No, not in the least.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.537
- Please let go. I can manage.
- You could have been thrown.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.699
- Is it any of your concern?
- You were in difficulty.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.986
- Would you rather I just abandon you?
- Because that would be unheard of.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.027
I wish you nothing but good, Elizabeth.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.509
- You must know that.
- Must I?

02:21.320 --> 02:24.505
Elizabeth, what happened?
One moment you were behind me, the next...

02:24.680 --> 02:26.705
- The horse bolted.
- I happened to be close by.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.542
Neither my wife nor my unborn child
require your assistance.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.280
Must you turn everything into a battle, George?

02:32.440 --> 02:38.822
Lay hand or set foot on anything of mine again
and you will find the battle has barely begun.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.142
Yam

03:52.480 --> 03:54.459
How looked Elizabeth?

03:55.480 --> 03:57.345
Must be near her time.

03:57.520 --> 04:00.978
- Or within a month of it.
- I know little of these things.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.463
- And care even less?
- Would you rather I care more?

04:06.640 --> 04:10.189
I'd rather there was one day in seven
that you did not rise before dawn.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.339
Then I fear you've married the wrong man.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.306
What is it for, Ross?

04:15.400 --> 04:19.029
You're always about some task,
but to what purpose?

04:20.880 --> 04:24.145
'Tis almost as if to keep your mind from thinking.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.505
Whereas you, my love, think too much.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.340
If you recall, my dear,
I was against you riding at all,

04:38.520 --> 04:40.385
with barely a month to go before the child.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.267
- Perhaps it was a little reckless.
- And not for the first time.

04:43.440 --> 04:47.979
Only yesterday, I find you lifting heavy books.
Before that, a three-mile walk.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.664
Perhaps you'd advise against me
joining you in Truro today.

04:52.840 --> 04:58.824
My dear, nothing would gratify me more than
to have you beside me at the grand opening,

04:59.000 --> 05:04.381
but our priority now must be
the welfare of the Warleggan heir.

05:04.560 --> 05:05.982
(Door opens)

05:06.720 --> 05:10.497
Mama, I heard Saphira took you for a gallop
and Uncle Ross saved you.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.229
- Who is spreading such tales?
- We ought to thank him.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.904
- Shall we ask him and Aunt Demelza to dinner?
- Excellent thought.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.880
Uncle Ross and Aunt Demelza
do not VlSlt us now.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.507
But why should that be?

05:24.680 --> 05:27.319
- They are Poldarks and we are...
- Warleggans.

05:28.520 --> 05:32.945
I've been thinking, boy, that the time has come
for you to take my name.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.304
He was born a Poldark!

05:35.480 --> 05:38.859
But since his mama's marriage,
he is now my son.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.584
(Sighs) Since you wish it,
I will change my name...

05:43.760 --> 05:45.022
Good boy.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.839
...to Geoffrey Charles Francis Poldark.

05:48.920 --> 05:49.989
(Sfliggers)

05:58.440 --> 06:01.944
No. No. No. No, my dear.

06:02.120 --> 06:06.545
Your efforts, though valiant, will be in vain.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.703
Dr Enys warned me he could only
prolong my life, not save it.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.223
Dr Enys may be wrong.

06:16.480 --> 06:22.498
Dr Enys is at sea and doubtless gives me
not a second thought.

06:22.680 --> 06:30.507
Still, there is, however,
something that would ease me.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.057
If, when I'm gone,

06:33.240 --> 06:39.622
you will be cared for by a husband
of wealth and consequence.

06:39.800 --> 06:46.182
Lord Coniston has written, asking for permission
to announce your engagement.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.227
And, as I have told you, I cannot consider it.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.779
- Oh.
- You are my only concern.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.825
Still, I wish...

06:55.000 --> 06:57.457
Sssh, Uncle. The subject is closed.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.182
MAN: Captain Poldark!
- (Horse whinnies)

07:12.120 --> 07:15.305
- Finally!
- George thanking you for saving Elizabeth?

07:15.480 --> 07:19.621
No. The thing I've been labouring
to bring about for months.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.421
I must leave immediately.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.505
Now, this old man went out to roam

07:34.680 --> 07:36.227
Twee, tweedle, oh, twee

07:36.400 --> 07:38.618
Now, this old man went out to roam

07:38.800 --> 07:40.859
Left his wife alone at home

07:41.040 --> 07:44.180
For a funny old woman was she, was she

07:44.360 --> 07:45.987
A funny old woman was she

07:46.160 --> 07:48.025
A funny old woman was she!

07:48.200 --> 07:52.625
- How will it be managed?
- With care and the utmost secrecy.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.507
Judas, I can scarce believe this day has come.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.184
It's far from over and anything could go amiss.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.467
Well?

08:17.560 --> 08:19.141
Tomorrow.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.981
(Demelza grunts)

08:27.280 --> 08:28.668
Who be this, then?

08:43.920 --> 08:45.387
(Giggles)

08:54.880 --> 08:57.940
- Prudie, this be my brother, Drake.
- Good day, ma'am.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.304
How be you've escaped Father's clutches?

09:00.480 --> 09:02.186
Nay, 'tis he did send me.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.746
- Wherefore?
- To fetch 'ee home.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.220
And is the broodmare safely back in the stall?

09:16.400 --> 09:20.063
I must ask you not to use such terms.
Elizabeth is much more to me than that.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.140
Which, frankly, baffles me.

09:22.320 --> 09:27.257
The thrall she's exerted over you
and Francis, Ross...

09:27.440 --> 09:29.305
I fail to see the fascination.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.619
- In fact...
- You think I could have done better.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.859
Yes, Uncle. You've said so many times.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.869
- And the Poldark brat?
- Grows more like his father every day.

09:41.040 --> 09:45.977
- Spoilt, petulant.
- And overly attached to his mother.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.299
Two words:

09:52.000 --> 09:56.187
Softly, Uncle.
These things must be done by degrees.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.225
Hm.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.426
But, in fact, I will be tackling the subject
this very afternoon,

10:01.600 --> 10:05.297
after we've commenced our mission
to be the only bank In Cornwall.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.663
- Be Ms Caph Po/(karkâ€™?
- My brother, Drake.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.458
- What brings you here?
- Father, sir, did send for Sister.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.699
To what purpose?

10:26.880 --> 10:30.099
To make his farewells. He's a-dying.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.861
Oh.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.587
- Will you go?
- I've no liking to.

10:37.760 --> 10:42.185
The man _never loved me.
All he ever give me was bruises.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.941
And I.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.079
Though it do grieve me, I think I must decline.

10:51.360 --> 10:55.820
'Tis brother Sam who did urge me here.
I tell'd him 'ee wouldn't come back.

10:58.560 --> 11:03.384
- 'Tis not for want of love of thee.
- I do know that, Sister.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.705
(Signs)

11:20.880 --> 11:25.419
The impending arrival brings fresh travail.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.899
That's cheerful.

11:30.680 --> 11:35.060
Blood, name, purpose, fate?

11:35.240 --> 11:37.219
The cards tell me naught.

11:38.920 --> 11:43.220
But he's coming sooner than we think.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.699
(Flute quartet plays lively piece)

12:09.600 --> 12:11.147
Uncle Ross!

12:19.480 --> 12:21.983
Come indoors, boy. The rabble are mustering.

12:26.600 --> 12:30.479
Would you like me to convey your respects
to young Master Warleggan?

12:30.640 --> 12:34.098
By all means, if ever he exists.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.738
As if that monstrous bank were not enough,

12:40.920 --> 12:44.742
now George must flaunt his ownership
of all the Trenwith Poldarks.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.502
Well, he means to put me out of business.

12:47.680 --> 12:52.105
- Every day, he grows more dominant.
- The war with France suits him.

12:52.280 --> 12:56.865
Men like Enys go off to fight,
while George stays home and grows rich.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.746
A fine way to make a profit.

13:00.680 --> 13:06.505
But of matters more pleasant,
your accounts are healthy, your mine prospers.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.057
My land thrives, my family is well

13:09.240 --> 13:12.903
and I promised my wife
my fighting days are done.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.240
Then what could possibly go wrong?

13:16.400 --> 13:17.981
(Chuckles)

13:18.160 --> 13:21.857
It do gladden the heart
to see how 'ee live now, Sister,

13:22.040 --> 13:26.340
_ in such contentment
and With so fine a gent as Cap'n Poldark.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.665
Yes, Brother. Truly, I am blessed.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.344
Tell Father that I'll pray for him.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.981
(Sniffs)

14:01.160 --> 14:03.139
MRS CHYNOWETH: Morwenna!

14:14.520 --> 14:16.101
This way, madam.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.980
- Are we here to ask for money, Mama?
- Don't be uncouth, Morwenna.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.301
Your father may have left us destitute,
but we are not so vulgar as to beg.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.262
My dear Mrs Chynoweth.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.945
Such a noble family name
and so undeserving of your current misfortune.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.680
I hope I can be of service on this auspicious day.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.422
May I present my daughter, Morwenna?

14:46.280 --> 14:50.307
I have the honour to be your relation,
since I married your cousin, Elizabeth.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.859
And, as you may know,
our first child will be born next month.

14:56.080 --> 15:00.505
- Yet I worry for my stepson.
- Is he unwell?

15:00.680 --> 15:04.662
Thankfully, no, but with the arrival of a sibling,

15:05.400 --> 15:09.507
I'm concerned he may no longer
receive the attention he deserves.

15:10.240 --> 15:14.267
But I've been speaking with your mother
and we think we've found a solution.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.225
The bank opening was so dull.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.062
I made Trigg take me home
as soon as it was over.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.064
ELIZABETH: Uncle George has returned.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.139
But who is that with him?

16:02.200 --> 16:03.667
A governess?

16:04.920 --> 16:06.581
What on earth do you mean?

16:07.360 --> 16:12.787
Forgive me, cousin, this is no reflection on you.
It's just...we have never discussed this.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.337
Why would Geoffrey Charles
even need a governess?

16:15.520 --> 16:19.104
- My dear, you must see what I'm thinking.
- Oh, we do!

16:20.000 --> 16:24.425
Do we want him to feel neglected
in his final year before he goes away to school?

16:24.600 --> 16:27.421
But I thought we'd agreed
he would not go away.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.342
I would miss him too much
and he would miss me.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.659
But your cousin is a most amiable girl.

16:32.840 --> 16:38.107
She's, of course, no substitute for you,
yet she will help him to be less dependent.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.022
And her presence here will
take the burden off you.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.259
My son is not a burden to me.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.305
And how can I applaud an arrangement

16:45.480 --> 16:49.029
in which I am no longer
the major influence in my child's life?

16:49.200 --> 16:52.180
But how could you ever continue to be

16:52.360 --> 16:56.182
when, in a month,
you will have our child to care for?

17:04.800 --> 17:09.669
- You fetched all I asked for?
- Now...you can supply the feast.

17:09.840 --> 17:11.979
If you can supply the guests.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.627
Mm.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.257
I saw George outside his new bank.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.619
Geoffrey Charles was with him.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.461
By choice?

17:21.640 --> 17:23.904
Francis must be turning in his grave.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.867
A message from the mine! 'Ee have a visitor.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.825
Who's our mystery caller?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.105
- Ah!
- Well, Uncle Ross.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.668
Well, Nephew.

17:50.840 --> 17:54.947
- So, you've escaped yourjailers?
- Seeing you reminded me of Papa.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.577
So I thought, "Why should I not
go and visit his mine?"

17:57.760 --> 17:59.899
- You're welcome any time.
- So I should hope.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.945
After all, mining is in my blood.

18:02.120 --> 18:06.022
Your father must have told you, mining is hard.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.701
And the results uncertain.

18:08.840 --> 18:12.389
- This seems real enough.
- Well, that's the finished article.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.540
I should like to find some for myself. May I?

18:28.280 --> 18:31.147
See here? This is a fine quartzy rock.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.220
And that becomes bright, shiny metal?

18:34.240 --> 18:35.946
Sounds easy, does it not?

18:37.720 --> 18:40.780
To think I'm the last of the Trenwith Poldarks.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.906
- You forget Aunt Agatha.
- So do you.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.865
Or so she tells me.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.019
I think of her often.

18:49.720 --> 18:50.857
And you.

19:14.360 --> 19:18.239
This is Monrvenna,
your new governess and my cousin.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.301
I hope, in time, we can become good friends.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.119
- Of course you will.
- (Aunt Agatha snorts)

19:24.800 --> 19:28.577
Oh, Aunt, Uncle Ross said
I must pass on his good wishes.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.625
- He misses you.
- And I him.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.064
- Where did you speak with Ross?
- At the mine.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.458
- I went to visit_ him.
- By whose permissmn?

19:35.640 --> 19:37.585
I need no permission to visit my own family.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.500
Quite right, boy!

19:47.600 --> 19:51.422
A fitty fizzog he have, the little brother of yourn.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.623
- I wish he'd never come.
- 'Ee'd sooner not be minded of him?

19:56.800 --> 19:59.507
There's much I'd sooner not be minded of.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.580
I should learn to be like Ross.

20:02.320 --> 20:07.144
What he can't abide to think on,
it's like it don't exist.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.979
(Elizabeth groans)

20:27.440 --> 20:28.987
(Groans)

20:58.800 --> 21:02.622
- Ross, am I a bad daughter?
- He was a bad father.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.507
And yet 'tis a bond, Ross.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.581
Father and child.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.099
Despite all, it cannot be denied.

21:19.040 --> 21:22.589
- Can you be there and back in time?
- If we leave now.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.585
If you're late, we cannot wait for you.

21:29.760 --> 21:33.423
Of course. You _mustn't_ miss the hour.
I can scarce believe 'tWIII happen at all.

21:33.600 --> 21:37.058
It must and it will,
provided the other parties play their part.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.702
No, Horace. You must stay here
and guard Uncle Ray.

21:47.880 --> 21:51.543
Caroline? Are you going out?

21:51.720 --> 21:55.383
I've been thinking over what you said, Uncle,
about Lord Coniston.

21:55.560 --> 22:00.702
- And I wondered if I shouldn't go to London.
- Oh, my dear.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.543
You'd make your old guardian very happy.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.699
I only wish I could come with you.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.977
I'll be there and back before you know it.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.864
(Door creaks open)

22:59.160 --> 23:03.142
Sister be here, Father, as ye did command.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.221
Take his hand.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.942
The hour is upon me, Daughter.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.706
I'd easier go...

23:47.840 --> 23:50.820
...ifI knOw'd 'ee've returned to the light.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.699
The Lord is merciful
and he shall guide 'ee home.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.859
I thank the Lord kindly.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.299
But I believe I know my own way.

24:02.320 --> 24:05.665
Samuel. Drake.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.027
'Tis for thee to lead the f...

24:12.400 --> 24:14.584
...the fallen souls of Cornwall.

24:16.320 --> 24:19.107
Aye, Father. We'll make it our mission.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.146
Ah, Ross, here you are.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.219
Tom Harry spied you riding this way.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.979
I believe I'm free to do so.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.987
Unless you've purchased
every church in Cornwall.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.379
There are a few places I've yet to purchase -

24:49.560 --> 24:51.221
Wheal Grace being one.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.657
I think we both know there are things
which even you cannot buy.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.660
Your stepson, for instance.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.025
It would be a mistake to encourage his visits.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.781
A mistake for whom?

25:07.360 --> 25:10.818
He's my stepson and heir.
He'd do well not to displease me.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.299
Surely his very existence displeases you.

25:15.680 --> 25:21.141
I shall tolerate him for the moment,
for I may soon have a son of my own.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.419
And then everything will change.

25:32.560 --> 25:38.385
Before Papa died, sometimes,
villagers would pass and we'd all talk together.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.142
But since Uncle George had fences built...

25:41.320 --> 25:43.185
Why did he so?

25:43.360 --> 25:46.340
Uncle George likes people
to know what he owns.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.385
He's been very kind to me.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.425
Oh, he is kind...

25:50.600 --> 25:53.057
till he gets what he wants.

25:53.240 --> 25:59.622
SAM: Jesus, lover of my soul
DRAKE: Of my soul

25:59.800 --> 26:06.023
Let me to thy bosom fly

26:06.760 --> 26:12.904
While the nearer waters roll

26:13.080 --> 26:19.224
While the tempest still is high

26:19.400 --> 26:24.269
Hide me, O, my saviour, hide...

26:24.440 --> 26:26.579
He can't last much longer.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.900
I'd stay, but...I'm already late.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.981
What will you do now?

26:35.280 --> 26:37.737
Sam do wish us to get out and spread the word.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.819
And what do you wish?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.979
Just to get out.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.257
(Horse whinnies)

28:10.560 --> 28:12.141
Shall we begin?

28:17.680 --> 28:21.980
PARSON: Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God...

28:25.960 --> 28:29.020
Does your mama approve
of you wandering so far?

28:29.200 --> 28:31.065
What harm can it do?

28:31.240 --> 28:33.105
I did not say I disapproved.

28:33.280 --> 28:36.340
I'm a great believer in fresh air and exercise.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.499
I see we'll agree very well.

28:39.960 --> 28:41.507
Oh, look. There.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.978
That's my Uncle Ross and Aunt Demelza.

28:48.920 --> 28:51.377
The other gentleman is Dr Enys.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.426
He used to attend our family
before Uncle George came.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.821
When Papa was alive,
we saw much of Uncle Ross.

29:01.720 --> 29:04.700
Even after, he and Mama were good friends.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.099
But now no longer.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.259
How sad.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.859
I wonder what could be the cause.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.821
- (Elizabeth screams)
- Elizabeth?

29:46.520 --> 29:48.943
Elizabeth? Elizabeth?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.701
Elizabeth?

29:50.880 --> 29:52.745
Help! Give me some help here!

29:52.920 --> 29:55.059
Help me carry her upstairs.

29:56.120 --> 29:59.669
And send for Dr Choake. Bid him come at once!

30:03.160 --> 30:07.824
To Ross, who conceived and executed the plan,
spirited me from Falmouth, arranged the parson.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.661
And even brought the bride's bouquet.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.819
- Demelza's handiwork.
- And the feast?

30:12.000 --> 30:13.422
Prudie must take some credit.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.307
Since Jud moved away,
she's had time to perfect her puddings.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.460
And that be another good reason
to bless his departuring.

30:19.640 --> 30:23.383
- You don't miss your former wedded bliss?
- Like a ruptured spleen.

30:24.280 --> 30:28.819
If Caroline and I are half as happy
as our saviours, we'll be fortunate indeed.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.265
Be Mr Penvenen very sick?

30:34.440 --> 30:36.499
He cannot last more than a fortnight.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.022
And he have no suspicions?

30:39.200 --> 30:41.543
Why would I distress him? But what could I do?

30:41.720 --> 30:45.497
The minute Dwight was granted leave,
I knew I could not wait a moment longer.

30:45.680 --> 30:50.583
- And must you return to your ship tomorrow?
- 24 hours' shore leave is all I'm permitted.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.737
Has Dr Choake arrived yet?

30:53.920 --> 30:56.297
The servant says
he's been called to another patient.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.061
- He'll come when he can.
- Damn him!

30:58.240 --> 31:00.800
I'll insist we_ have first call
on his serwces in future.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.269
- What other doctor is hereabouts?
- Dr Enys.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.898
That quacksalver? Absolutely not.
In any case, is he not at sea?

31:07.080 --> 31:09.742
- What of Dr Behenna?
- Lives the other side of Truro.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.866
- It'll take time to summon him.
- Let him be summoned.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.539
(Breathes rapidly)

31:21.200 --> 31:24.704
Demelza and I regret
we have chores to attend to.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.859
Let me show you to your room.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.586
Do you like her?

31:39.440 --> 31:40.623
I once feared you did not.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.701
Now I know her better,
I think her a remarkable woman.

31:43.880 --> 31:48.146
At pains to disguise her own goodness,
as if it were something to be ashamed of.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.299
Like someone else we know?

31:51.680 --> 31:53.545
I'm forever in your debt.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.984
The debt was mine long before it was yours.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.784
I am honoured to be able to repay it.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.979
To Nampara with haste.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.620
(Door opens)

32:20.840 --> 32:22.819
Are you nervous?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.627
I would be...

32:24.800 --> 32:26.984
were tonight our first time.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.749
- A remarkable woman I've married.
- And I a remarkable man.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.547
Still, I hate having to deceive my uncle.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.377
Would it kill him to know the truth?

32:46.840 --> 32:49.661
He has _his heart set _on
my becoming Lady Coniston.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.741
It would give out entirely
if he knew I was Mrs Enys.

32:52.920 --> 32:56.026
- I'm sorry for that.
- I could not be less so.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.380
But, in his case,
ignorance is most assuredly bliss.

33:01.400 --> 33:05.939
And, in mine, bliss is most assuredly Caroline.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.939
It'll be hard for Dwight to leave again.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.382
Yes.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.345
And yet you envy him.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.987
Do I?

33:19.160 --> 33:21.537
His clarity of purpose, perhaps.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.300
The simple act of living in the moment,
not knowing whether you'll live or die.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.506
And something more?

33:31.600 --> 33:33.227
A life more simple?

33:33.400 --> 33:36.142
No shadow from the past
which may come back to haunt him?

33:36.880 --> 33:40.543
Everyone has shadows.
The trick is to outrun them.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.267
Or ignore them.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.541
(Door slams)

33:47.560 --> 33:50.302
A letter come from Trenwith
from Master Geoffrey.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.698
Has he pushed his stepfather down the stairs?

33:52.880 --> 33:54.268
(Giggles)

34:00.040 --> 34:02.019
Elizabeth's been taken ill.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.669
Dr Choake cannot be found,
so the boy begs Dr Enys to come in his stead.

34:13.440 --> 34:18.309
There appears to be no external damage,
but these internal pains,

34:18.480 --> 34:21.347
you say the onset occurred
directly after the fall?

34:21.520 --> 34:23.021
Almost at once.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.179
Do you think they will go away?

34:26.200 --> 34:27.622
I suspect not.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.497
Your wife has suffered a serious fall.
You should prepare yourself.

34:36.680 --> 34:39.820
For what? Surely there's no risk to the infant?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.467
Or Elizabeth?

34:41.640 --> 34:46.942
Childbirth can be a precarious business,
particularly when it comes a month early.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.705
You're not suggesting...?

34:50.880 --> 34:53.257
These are birthing pains, sir.

34:54.640 --> 34:57.200
The child will be born tonight.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.160
But surely that's a month before her time?

35:09.320 --> 35:11.902
Doubtless the fall has brought on her travail.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.339
So much for my wedding night.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.464
Pours DOV

35:26.440 --> 35:28.021
More port?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.979
(Moans)

35:44.640 --> 35:46.619
(Elizabeth moans)

35:52.520 --> 35:54.499
(Agonised moan)

36:05.080 --> 36:07.457
I warned you she was a poor choice.

36:09.360 --> 36:14.343
A younger, more robust specimen
would have better served the purpose.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.341
(Door opens and closes)

36:27.080 --> 36:29.219
How difficult it must be for him.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.379
He and Elizabeth.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.024
Forgive me, I've no wish to be impertinent.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.421
- But did they not...
- What?

36:43.040 --> 36:45.019
...love each other...once?

36:46.760 --> 36:48.625
And though it's long past,

36:48.800 --> 36:54.818
to know that tonight she'll be delivered of
the child of his worst enemy, it must be vexing.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.939
Yes, I believe it is.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.779
(Elizabeth moans)

37:07.120 --> 37:11.898
If it comes to a choice,
obviously, the child takes priority.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.342
Ohh...

37:19.560 --> 37:23.667
She is in a good deal of pain.
When do you expect Dr Choake?

37:23.840 --> 37:26.582
God knows! It's hours since
he was summoned to Killewarren.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.185
Killewarren? On whose account?

37:29.360 --> 37:33.387
Ray Penvenen's, naturally.
Apparently, he's taken a turn for the worst.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.540
- And just when his niece has left for London.
- Dear God.

37:36.720 --> 37:39.780
Well, he's had a good innings.
No one's immortal.

37:39.960 --> 37:43.839
Dr Behenna is delayed in Truro. You would not
think of leaving my wife unattended?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.137
Of course not.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.981
But I'm expected back at Nampara.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.027
I'd be grateful if you could have
a note delivered for me.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.747
DEMELZA: Ross?

37:52.920 --> 37:54.182
Ross?

37:57.320 --> 37:58.867
No sign of Dwight?

38:01.720 --> 38:03.699
How unlucky is he?

38:05.080 --> 38:08.106
This accident could hardly
have come at a worse time.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.259
You think it an accident, then?

38:11.600 --> 38:13.261
The boy's letter said so.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.386
Yet why would Elizabeth fall down the stairs?

38:20.520 --> 38:22.306
(Knock at door)

38:23.400 --> 38:26.301
(Front door opens and closes)

38:26.480 --> 38:28.300
(Horse gallops away)

38:28.480 --> 38:31.586
That ape Tom Harry!
How dare he show his ugly, fat fizzog 'ere!

38:37.000 --> 38:38.262
Oh, Judas!

38:40.360 --> 38:42.225
Dear God, I must go to my uncle.

38:42.400 --> 38:46.348
- Can Dwight meet me there?
- Elizabeth is gravely ill.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.341
How ill?

38:52.040 --> 38:53.462
Is she dying?

38:55.520 --> 38:56.908
Is the child?

38:57.640 --> 38:59.665
The letter doesn't say so, but...

38:59.840 --> 39:01.307
I must go to Killewarren at once.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.540
You'll go with Caroline?

39:04.720 --> 39:06.426
Of course.

39:19.240 --> 39:20.707
(Horse neighs)

39:20.880 --> 39:23.462
What is that? At the edge of the moon.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.987
- What is it?
- A black moon.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.024
'Tis a bad omen, mark my words.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.383
DWIGHT: Quickly.
- (Groans)

39:42.560 --> 39:43.902
(Gasps)

39:44.080 --> 39:46.059
(Moans)

39:47.280 --> 39:48.497
Feetup.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.057
(Wails)

39:57.320 --> 39:58.457
Sam?

40:10.400 --> 40:12.379
What do it mean?

40:14.480 --> 40:16.857
'Tis the coming of the shadow of death.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.659
(Breathes raggedly)

40:33.680 --> 40:37.423
- I ne'er was the God-fearing kind.
- Nor I.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.579
But if I were, I'd pray.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.825
For what, maid?

40:43.000 --> 40:44.865
Deliverance.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.703
(Elizabeth moans and cries out)

40:58.560 --> 41:00.425
Is it alive?

41:00.600 --> 41:02.864
(Gasps for breath) Is it alive?

41:08.640 --> 41:11.222
(Death rattle)

41:23.000 --> 41:24.979
(Gentle sobbing)

41:31.240 --> 41:35.700
Father...l will do as 'ee bid me...

41:37.520 --> 41:40.307
go forth into the world and save souls.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.784
Do 'ee join me, Brother?

41:59.840 --> 42:01.819
Uncle Ray?

42:03.440 --> 42:06.944
Caroline? You should be
halfway to London by now.

42:07.120 --> 42:10.783
I came back. I realised there is nothing there
which cannot wait.

42:12.160 --> 42:14.025
And will you stay with me now?

42:14.200 --> 42:16.179
For as long as you wish.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.059
(Baby gurgles)

42:38.760 --> 42:40.466
You have a son.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.861
Your son is healthy, strong.

42:58.080 --> 43:01.060
He appears no worse for coming a month early.

43:56.880 --> 44:00.145
- I think we need to detain you no longer.
- On the contrary.

44:01.360 --> 44:04.102
Your wife has endured a difficult birthing.

44:04.280 --> 44:08.580
Much as it inconveniences me,
I cannot leave until I'm assured of her safety.

44:18.520 --> 44:21.899
- He favours you, I think.
- Yes.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.458
Yes, I see the resemblance.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.507
May I present my son and heir?

45:12.040 --> 45:15.737
So, that's what an eight-month brat looks like!

45:15.920 --> 45:20.266
Hold your tongue, old woman, before
my nephew has you thrown on the midden!

45:21.280 --> 45:25.159
MORWENNA: What will be his name?
- Old family names be the best.

45:25.320 --> 45:29.142
Joshua or Francis or Ross.

45:31.160 --> 45:34.823
Elizabeth and I agree
his name will be Valentine.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.582
May I take Geoffrey Charles to see his mama?

45:38.680 --> 45:41.865
- Can you not wait till morning?
- I want to see her now.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.419
Chastise him for his insolence.

45:51.200 --> 45:54.340
- Show him who's the master here.
- Aye, do!

45:59.480 --> 46:02.825
- Call Tom Harry.
- That great lump!

46:03.000 --> 46:07.300
- He doesn't frighten me!
- Well, he should.

46:15.080 --> 46:18.629
Take Miss Poldark's chair
and remove it to her chamber...

46:18.800 --> 46:21.860
and Miss Poldark with it.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.339
Unhand me, you devils!

46:28.520 --> 46:30.943
George, tell them to put me down!

46:31.120 --> 46:32.985
- Carry on.
- (Laughs)

46:33.160 --> 46:36.903
Elizabeth shall hear of this!
Manhandled in my own house!

46:37.080 --> 46:40.777
Stay, you vermin! I would speak!

46:46.560 --> 46:48.141
That child of yours...

46:49.720 --> 46:50.982
What of him?

46:51.960 --> 46:54.019
...cursed he be!

46:54.200 --> 46:59.399
Born under a black moon.
No good shall come to him!

47:10.000 --> 47:11.183
What?

47:13.240 --> 47:16.027
(Aunt Agatha remonstrates)

48:34.360 --> 48:40.185
I have never known the blessing
of a happy marriage...

48:42.000 --> 48:44.059
...but it's been my privilege...

48:45.080 --> 48:47.059
...to have had the guardianship of you.

48:47.240 --> 48:50.425
Sssh, Uncle, do not exhaust yourself.

48:50.600 --> 48:52.864
Had I ever married...

48:54.360 --> 48:58.740
...I might have understood
what it is to follow one's heart.

49:00.680 --> 49:05.743
And I should not
have prevented you from doing so.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.345
Can you ever forgive me?

49:11.520 --> 49:16.059
Uncle Ray, what if I told you
there was nothing to forgive?

49:26.280 --> 49:28.657
Oh, my dear girl.

49:31.280 --> 49:35.159
My dear, dear girl.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.386
(SObs)

50:29.560 --> 50:31.425
Elizabeth is alive...

50:31.600 --> 50:33.386
and her son.

50:36.160 --> 50:39.539
Dwight returned just before dawn
and left shortly after for Falmouth.

50:42.480 --> 50:44.937
- I must speak with George.
- Why?

50:48.440 --> 50:51.420
_ There is a conversation
which can no longer be av0ided.

50:59.600 --> 51:01.579
(Waves crashing)

51:02.440 --> 51:04.305
The babe doesn't look at all like me.

51:04.480 --> 51:09.019
That's because he's your half brother.
He may be more Warleggan than Chynoweth.

51:14.560 --> 51:17.347
Now that he's here,
you must be prepared for change.

51:17.520 --> 51:20.865
- Your mama will be much occupied.
- She will always have time for me.

51:21.040 --> 51:23.543
Of course. Love will never change, but...

51:25.120 --> 51:26.781
Where are we?

51:26.960 --> 51:28.825
Is this still Trenwith land?

51:29.000 --> 51:30.865
Nampara's. Does it matter?

51:31.040 --> 51:35.022
- Only that your Uncle George may...
- Uncle George doesn't concern me.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.379
Let's go further!

51:39.840 --> 51:42.024
(Giggles) Come on!

51:56.440 --> 51:59.898
- (Door closes)
- Well, Ross!

52:03.240 --> 52:05.105
Are you here to congratulate me?

52:05.280 --> 52:07.464
Fatherhood changes everything, does it not?

52:11.720 --> 52:13.699
Will you take a drink with me?

52:37.280 --> 52:39.259
Why have you really come?

52:41.280 --> 52:43.464
To make a bargain with you.

52:45.120 --> 52:47.497
Always assuming you have something I want.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.386
I do.

52:51.280 --> 52:53.498
Myself, out of your life.

52:56.320 --> 52:58.299
So these are my terms.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.457
You possess things I hold dear.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.227
My family mine, Wheal Leisure.

53:08.800 --> 53:10.939
My family home, Trenwith.

53:11.120 --> 53:14.339
But, most importantly,
my great aunt and nephew.

53:16.080 --> 53:17.547
Is that all?

53:18.640 --> 53:20.619
Have a care for them.

53:21.520 --> 53:26.503
Do not use them as a means to injure me
or you will wish you had never been born.

53:29.160 --> 53:32.140
In return, I will remove myself from your life.

53:34.120 --> 53:37.465
You will live in your world and I will live in mine

53:37.640 --> 53:42.179
and there will be no need _
for our paths to cross ever again.

53:52.480 --> 53:53.697
(Door slams)

53:53.880 --> 53:55.745
ls't far now?

53:55.920 --> 53:57.979
A mile or two, Brother.

53:58.160 --> 54:00.344
Will 'ee ask her or shall I?

54:02.200 --> 54:04.577
As to that, I believe the Lord will guide us.

54:06.240 --> 54:08.663
Do 'ee believe 'tis all his plan?

54:08.840 --> 54:12.662
For instance, do he decree us
to meet yon souls up yonder?

54:16.280 --> 54:20.102
Maybe so, Brother.
For he hath made we fishers of men.

54:20.280 --> 54:22.100
And this could be our first catch.

54:26.240 --> 54:29.744
I'm hungry. I hope Mrs Trigg's made jellies!

54:32.160 --> 54:34.025
- Good day.
- Good day to you, ma'am.

54:34.200 --> 54:36.179
Do 'ee know the way to Nampara?

54:37.160 --> 54:38.821
But we know'st the way.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.581
I regret I'm a stranger here.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.022
I'm not.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.177
Stay on the path and you'll come to it directly.

54:46.360 --> 54:48.339
Much obliged, sir.

54:50.280 --> 54:52.145
We'm strangers us'selves.

54:52.320 --> 54:55.824
Do 'ee bide in these parts
or just be passing through?

54:56.000 --> 54:57.422
She's staying.

54:57.600 --> 54:59.579
Are you not, Morwenna?

55:00.680 --> 55:02.307
Morwenna?

55:04.280 --> 55:06.783
'Tis a lilting, musical name.

55:10.440 --> 55:11.782
I'm Drake.

55:11.960 --> 55:13.825
'Tis a pleasure to meet 'ee.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.458
- And you, sir.
- I hope we may meet again.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.984
I know why you've come.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.945
This is a change of heart.

55:53.120 --> 55:56.180
There was a time when you fought
to escape your family.

55:57.280 --> 55:58.907
As you now mean to escape yours?

55:59.080 --> 56:00.741
George is not my family.

56:00.920 --> 56:02.899
Geoffrey Charles is.

56:04.680 --> 56:06.739
I must trust him to his mother's care.

56:08.080 --> 56:09.661
And the child?

56:11.400 --> 56:13.379
To his father's.

56:17.240 --> 56:18.582
Yes, Ross.

56:18.760 --> 56:21.422
So we'll have no more to do with Trenwith.

56:21.600 --> 56:23.465
I think that's for the best.

56:23.640 --> 56:27.098
No good can now come of a connection
between our two families.

56:30.840 --> 56:33.479
And since you've lost a part of your family...

56:34.720 --> 56:37.427
...can you find it in you
to embrace a part of mine?

56:42.360 --> 56:44.100
My dear...

56:45.400 --> 56:48.346
...you will be pleased to hear we are rid of him.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.979
- Who?
- Ross.

56:51.680 --> 56:53.944
Finally, he has admitted defeat.

56:54.120 --> 56:58.307
He will never again approach our house
nor any member of our family.

56:58.480 --> 56:59.981
He actually said that?

57:00.160 --> 57:01.263
Mm.

57:02.080 --> 57:05.823
A new chapter begins...without him.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.699
(He kisses her head)

57:15.680 --> 57:17.944
There's something I must tell you, Ross.

57:19.040 --> 57:21.019
Though I fear you will not like it.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.387
I'm with child again.

57:29.280 --> 57:31.259
You're not displeased?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.707
I might wish the timing were better.

57:36.880 --> 57:38.666
The war's getting deadlier

57:38.840 --> 57:43.027
and everything in this world
seems less certain...except for you.

57:43.200 --> 57:46.658
- Are you so certain of me?
- Perhaps I don't deserve to be.

57:47.680 --> 57:49.386
No, you do not.

57:50.520 --> 57:52.784
But with you beside me...

57:54.720 --> 57:56.381
...whatever life sends...

57:58.680 --> 58:00.864
We can face it.
