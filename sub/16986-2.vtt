Lesson time, class.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.262
Today we're going to learn about...

00:36.286 --> 00:37.287
[gagging]

00:37.371 --> 00:38.580
[class gasps]

00:38.664 --> 00:40.207

00:40.290 --> 00:42.042

Can't breathe.

[screaming]

00:48.006 --> 00:49.633
- He's dead.
- I didn't do it.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.386
Ta-da!

00:52.469 --> 00:54.388
I was only playing dead,

00:54.471 --> 00:58.559
a method of fooling predators
that's both effective and fun.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.852
That wasn't fun.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.604
Well, not for you.

01:02.688 --> 01:07.192
Now, get into packs
and try it while I practice, too.

01:07.276 --> 01:10.445
[yawns]
Oh, no... dying.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.363
[snoring]

01:11.446 --> 01:12.823
Guys, wanna be in my pack?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.950
Lerk, Thunk.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.702
Wait, who's that?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.328
[Lerk] That's the new boy.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.581
You know, with the really weird name.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.584
- "Kevin."
- Hmm.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.335
Hey, Kevin.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.712
Wanna join our group?

01:26.795 --> 01:27.713
Eep, no!

01:27.796 --> 01:29.117
We don't know anything about him.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.050
He could be a man-eater.
He could be a cave-robber.

01:32.134 --> 01:36.513
He could be a bunch of pig rats
in a pelt pretending to be one of us.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.391
Hello.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.478
[gasps]
Wait, that'd be amazing.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.480
- I know.
- [grunting]

01:45.564 --> 01:47.524
Please, guys.
He's just a boy.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.109
A normal,
rowdy, funky-smelling...

01:49.192 --> 01:50.527
- Hey.
- Hmm?

01:53.697 --> 01:55.490
You guys catch the sunrise today?

01:55.574 --> 01:59.536
I watch it every morning so I never
forget there's beauty in the world.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.913
[babbling]

02:05.584 --> 02:07.836

- Uh... okay.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.170
See ya.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.256
[giggling]

02:14.426 --> 02:19.097
Whoa, Eep, if you're playing dead,
I am really impressed.

02:19.181 --> 02:22.392
And if you're not,
I'm totally freaking out!

02:24.102 --> 02:28.148
Eep?
Eep, wake up.

02:28.231 --> 02:31.318
Eep, Eep, wake up.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.528
Hey, she's not dead.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.322
Wait, wait.
Maybe she's dead.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.698
Nope, alive.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.033
[gasps]

02:38.116 --> 02:39.284
Oh, what happened?

02:39.368 --> 02:41.953
I was fine one moment
and then the next thing I knew,

02:42.037 --> 02:44.706
the Earth moved
and my heart skipped a beat.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.084
It was... horrible.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.544
Uh-oh.
She's got it bad.

02:49.628 --> 02:50.796
Eep, try to think.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.923
Have you been in contact
with any boys today?

02:53.006 --> 02:54.800
Yeah. Why?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.301
Oh, what's wrong with me?

02:56.385 --> 02:58.220
Honey, honey, it's okay.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.430
Sometimes teens feel like this.

03:00.514 --> 03:04.351
It just means you've fallen
hopelessly under a curse.

03:05.852 --> 03:06.895
A curse?

03:08.271 --> 03:09.689
Not just any curse.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.818
I'm afraid you have "The Crush."

03:14.778 --> 03:15.946
[sighs]

03:18.490 --> 03:19.491
Don't worry, Eep.

03:19.574 --> 03:23.745
We'll find a cure for your curse here
in the Cave of Secrets.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.123
[Thunk wailing]

03:26.206 --> 03:28.542
[continues wailing]

03:28.625 --> 03:29.876
Thunk, you can stop that.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.297
For a long time,
cavemen have painted these walls

03:34.381 --> 03:36.925
with all they've learned
about the world's mysteries,

03:37.008 --> 03:39.010
like the contagious yawn.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.304
[both] Oh!

03:41.388 --> 03:43.265
[yawning]

03:43.932 --> 03:45.851
The ever-returning eye crud.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.728
Whoa!

03:48.812 --> 03:52.107
[Ugga] And of course, The Crush.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.942
[Eep] Wow!

03:54.025 --> 03:56.987
Does every boy that causes
The Crush look like Kevin?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.822
They tend to be a certain type, yeah.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.742
[sighs]
Everything I'm feeling is here.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.703
I have no appetite,
I can't focus.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.164
[sighs]
At least I'm not hallucinating.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.833
[with Spanish accent]
Think again, my love.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.835
[laughter]

04:14.004 --> 04:15.714
Pig rats, I'm doomed.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.632
No, we'll get you through this, Eep.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.843
When I was your age, I had a curse.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.262
Eww!
Dad made you feel like this?

04:22.345 --> 04:24.431
[laughs]
No.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.099
Not your dad.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.434
[guffawing]

04:29.060 --> 04:31.146
The point is, I survived.

04:31.229 --> 04:36.151
Plus, after The Crush comes
something good: the secret of girl talk.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.946
No, no, I won't live
with this thing anymore. See?

04:40.030 --> 04:44.493
Oh, the cave says
there's a chance I can cure it if I...

04:44.576 --> 04:46.119
talk to Kevin?

04:46.203 --> 04:47.496
[gasps]

04:47.579 --> 04:48.705
No, no, I can't.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.623
[hyperventilating]

04:49.706 --> 04:52.542
Just the idea
makes my breathing all crazy.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.170
Geez, why is everyone
suddenly looking at me?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.253
Relax.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.006
That's just The Crush messing with you.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.883
You can talk to Kevin.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.677
Ugga, no. The last thing
she should do is talk to him.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.561
In fact, we should seal her in a cave
so she never talks to boys again.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.391
Yeah!
Or some less crazy idea.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.977
We'll beat the curse our own way.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.356
[grunts] Crush, you are going down!

05:14.439 --> 05:16.817
[gasps]
What's this?

05:16.900 --> 05:19.736
The mystery of where
babies come from?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.196
- [yelps]
- When you're older!

05:22.322 --> 05:26.326
Okay, The Crush is trying
to make me think about Kevin.

05:26.409 --> 05:31.122
So maybe I can beat it
if I get my mind off of Kevin.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.791
[sighs]
Kevin.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.335
[giggling]
I wonder what he's doing right now.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.878
Hmm... No!

05:36.962 --> 05:41.049
Quick, move those rocks
from there to there over and over. Go.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.425
[chuckles]
Hey, this works.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.761
By staying busy, I don't have time
to think about...

05:44.844 --> 05:46.137
Hey.

05:52.394 --> 05:53.270
[shrieking]

05:53.353 --> 05:54.854
[giggling]

05:54.938 --> 05:56.731
Your abs are rock hard.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.150
Whoa! Okay.
Okay, you know what?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.128
Maybe you should just stay away
from Kevin altogether.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.321
Ah, that's it.
I'll avoid him.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.283
Wait, is this avoiding?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.159
'Cause it feels more like stalking.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.245
[sighing]
Dad, if I'm gonna stay away from him,

06:10.328 --> 06:13.832
I have to know where he is at all times,
who he talks to and how he sleeps, right?

06:13.915 --> 06:18.295
Uh... Crush, is Eep in there,
'cause you're creepin' me out.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.462
How so?

06:19.546 --> 06:20.380
[shrieks]

06:20.463 --> 06:21.339
His footprints!

06:21.423 --> 06:22.465
[sniffing]

06:22.549 --> 06:23.383
[shrieks]

06:23.466 --> 06:25.844
[sighs] He smells like
toe sweat and rainbows.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.596
[giggling, sniffing]

06:27.679 --> 06:29.681
Be tough, honey.
Your dad's right here.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.933
[groans] Oh, man,
The Crush makes you strong!

06:32.017 --> 06:33.893
[straining]
No, no!

06:33.977 --> 06:35.061
New plan.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.273
I'll practice pressing
my crush deep down inside,

06:38.356 --> 06:40.692
and if it comes back up,
I re-press it.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.111
Repress how you feel.
Exactly.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.194
Thunk, hit it.

06:44.863 --> 06:45.863
[shrieks]

06:45.905 --> 06:48.950
Let me hold your hand. I wanna kill
prey for you. I'll pick your nits.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.076
No!

06:50.160 --> 06:54.122
His dimples...
aren't that adorable.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.041
Good, Eep.
Now be dreamier, Thunk.

06:56.124 --> 06:56.958
Dreamier!

06:57.042 --> 07:02.130
Hey, girl, let's find a molar bear tunnel
for two and talk about our feelings.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.423
[gasps, giggling]

07:03.506 --> 07:04.674
- [kissing]
- [yelps]

07:04.758 --> 07:06.343
Okay, that might be too dreamy.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.053
- You could do, you could do less.
- Whoa!

07:08.136 --> 07:09.596
[screams, grunts]

07:09.679 --> 07:11.932
- [buzzing]
- [shrieking]

07:12.807 --> 07:15.894
- You okay, girl?
- No, Thunk, it hurts.

07:15.977 --> 07:19.272
[gasps]
Although it is distracting.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.608
Thunk, maximum dreamy.

07:21.691 --> 07:26.029
Girl, I wanna form a band with other
non-threatening boys my age

07:26.112 --> 07:28.031
and sing love songs to you.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.032
[moaning]
See?

07:29.115 --> 07:32.911
The pain makes it easier
to repress The Crush.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.080
Hooray for pain!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.626
Time for roll call.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.379
Short girl, noisy, weird kid,

07:42.462 --> 07:45.966
weirder kid who cheats death every time
he's not devoured by something, Pat.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.510
Eep, sure you're ready
to be back at school?

07:48.593 --> 07:50.428
What if the real Kevin shows up?

07:50.512 --> 07:53.306
Not my just-as-handsome-but-not-as-alive
Kevin.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.599
Did I miss something?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.643
I feel like I missed something.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.687
It's just that I have The Crush, Lerk.

07:58.770 --> 08:02.357
Or rather, had,
since I can totally handle Kevin now.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.817
Hey.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.988
I just wanna say you've been
on my mind ever since we met

08:08.071 --> 08:10.490
and I'd like us
to get to know each other.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.575
[gasps, giggles]

08:13.910 --> 08:15.453
- [grunts]
- [bees buzzing]

08:17.956 --> 08:20.583
Whoa!
Take that, real Kevin.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.669
Uh, okay.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.171
But I was talking to you.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.007
Ew, gross!

08:27.090 --> 08:27.924
[chuckles]

08:28.008 --> 08:30.010
You're not even close to my type.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.261
[grunts]

08:32.345 --> 08:34.097
Repress it, Eep, repress it.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.390
[panting]

08:36.474 --> 08:37.892
[growls]

08:37.976 --> 08:40.770
But seeing him with Lerk feels so awful.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.147
All I wanna do is...

08:42.230 --> 08:43.690
Mm...

08:44.899 --> 08:45.899
[snarling]

08:47.402 --> 08:49.654
- [shrieking]
- [screaming]

08:51.614 --> 08:52.949
Crush!

08:53.033 --> 08:55.285
[screaming]

08:55.368 --> 08:58.038
Oh. So that's why
they call it a crush.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.247
That's clever.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.582
- [screams]
- [grunting]

09:00.665 --> 09:03.501
You know, honey,
after helping Eep get over her crush,

09:03.585 --> 09:05.295
I feel like a great dad.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.255
Some might say the best.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.659
- [Eep snarling]
- [Thunk screaming]

09:08.715 --> 09:10.467
Nope, just a dad.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.719
- [Eep growling]
- [all screaming]

09:14.471 --> 09:15.805
[snarling]

09:15.889 --> 09:16.973
Eep, don't.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.934
We swore we'd be pals forever.
Remember?

09:20.018 --> 09:22.103
That day I went to school
in my underpelts?

09:22.187 --> 09:23.730
Wait, that might've been a dream.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.981
Eep!

09:25.065 --> 09:26.316
There is no Eep!

09:26.399 --> 09:29.235
Only The Crush.
Kevin belongs to me.

09:29.319 --> 09:33.156
His eyes, his hair, his one crooked tooth
that's just so cute, I wanna...

09:33.239 --> 09:34.657
[cackles]

09:34.741 --> 09:36.326
He's all mine.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.453
Eep!
Eep, no.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.163
Put the boulder down.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.664
Yeah, honey, you've gotta fight it.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.584
Mom, Dad?

09:44.667 --> 09:48.004
Go! You're embarrassing me!

09:48.088 --> 09:49.756
[whimpering]
No, no, I need help.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.050
Repressing The Crush
made it stronger.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.469
[snarling]
Which feels good!

09:54.552 --> 09:57.305
[whimpering] No, it does not.
But I've tried everything to stop it.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.390
Well, everything except...

10:00.141 --> 10:00.975
[grunting]

10:01.059 --> 10:02.185
[growling]
Kevin!

10:02.268 --> 10:04.896
[coughs]
Kevin.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.982
I didn't want to talk to you,

10:08.066 --> 10:14.030
but you gave me The Crush
and ever since, I've been a total loon.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.949
[sighs]
And now my face is hot

10:16.032 --> 10:21.621
and it's like there are butterhummers
in my stomach, and they're all barfing.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.040
But I did it, okay?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.793
I talked to you.

10:26.876 --> 10:31.005
Do you have anything to say to me?

10:31.089 --> 10:32.841
Eep...

10:32.924 --> 10:34.050
[wailing]
just don't hurt me.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.636
- Please!
- Hurt you?

10:36.719 --> 10:39.097
- I'm not gonna...
- I'm too young to die.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.141
I can't even grow underarm hair yet.

10:41.224 --> 10:44.060
[whimpers]
Look.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.396
[groans]
Pull it together, man.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.730
[scoffs]
Well, that's over.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.190
Curse is broken.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.029
Appetite's back.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.323
[chuckles]
Looks like The Crush is gone for good.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.783
Yep, it's behind us.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.451
But just to be safe, new rule:

11:00.535 --> 11:02.704
Eep is forbidden
from Kevin till the day she dies.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.705
[chuckles]

11:03.788 --> 11:05.206
Grug, no.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.793
Don't you know what happens when you
forbid a teen from doing something?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.131
[bellowing]

11:13.214 --> 11:14.841
[with Spanish accent]
Come with me, Eep.

11:14.924 --> 11:18.845
We will live together forever
in the cave of my mother.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.640
[sighs, giggles]

11:27.896 --> 11:33.318
[gasps] The mystery of where
babies come from?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.279
[music playing]

11:44.245 --> 11:45.288
[grunting]

11:45.371 --> 11:46.915
[howling]

11:46.998 --> 11:49.167
- [grunting]
- [panting]

11:49.250 --> 11:51.210
[chuckling]
Point for us!

11:51.294 --> 11:53.004
Way to use your belly, Lerk!

11:53.087 --> 11:55.882
[chuckling]
My belly is very talented.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.258
You should hear it sing.

11:57.342 --> 12:01.304
Hey... Don't worry.
I've been practicing.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.558
[groaning]
Thunk, wrong way.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.018
[groaning]

12:07.101 --> 12:09.103
Do we have to let Thunk serve?

12:09.187 --> 12:11.898
He, like, breaks every egg
he touches.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.399
[whispering]
I brought extras.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.778
We're Thunk-proof.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.237
[yelling]

12:22.325 --> 12:24.661
[grunting]

12:26.621 --> 12:27.621
[giggling]

12:33.878 --> 12:35.338
[chirping]

12:36.506 --> 12:38.967
Great, another game
is Thunked up.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.094
Really?
I thought I blew it.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.388
Wait, does "Thunked up" mean bad?

12:43.471 --> 12:45.765
It means we need more eggs.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.434
- I'll get 'em.
- Um, let us handle it.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.145
You can't exactly
be trusted with eggs.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.981
Can't be trusted?

12:53.064 --> 12:54.148
Fine.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.734
I don't wanna play
Egg Toss anymore anyway.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.987
I'm gonna hang out
with my other friends.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.114
Thunk has other friends?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.283
Ha! Joke's on them.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.495
Little do they know,
I don't have any other friends.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.332
Oh.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.960
[snarling]

13:14.043 --> 13:14.877
[gasps]

13:14.961 --> 13:16.713
Oh, no.
Liyotes!

13:16.796 --> 13:19.465
Uh, what was it Dad
always said about them?

13:19.549 --> 13:21.175
Liyotes are trouble, son.

13:21.259 --> 13:25.304
They stink, they steal food,
heard they once even ate a man.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.557
So, like Gran, but five times worse.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.309
Hey, Thunk, back on me.
Focus.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.603
Stay away from liyotes.
Away!

13:35.481 --> 13:36.482
[growling]

13:36.566 --> 13:38.067
Easy, guys.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.444
I'm not lookin' for trouble.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.363
How about I go
and you finish your lunch?

13:42.447 --> 13:43.614
[Amber]
Aha!

13:43.698 --> 13:47.035
This where Amber lunch
get dragged off to.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.703
[whimpering]

13:48.786 --> 13:50.955
Crood boy no wanna see this.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.458
Cover eye...
uh, eyes.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.878
- [shrieks]
- [whimpering]

13:56.961 --> 13:58.171
Are you sure they stole it?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.256
Uh, maybe your lunch wasn't dead.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.008
Oh, Amber sure.

14:02.091 --> 14:06.179
Every caveman know liyotes
can't be trusted with food.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.848
Can't be trusted?
But...

14:09.724 --> 14:11.517
you could trust these liyotes,

14:11.601 --> 14:13.478
because I was here with them,

14:13.561 --> 14:18.608
rehearsing for our song
for the valley talent show.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.902
There no valley talent show.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.571
Also, what is talent show?

14:23.654 --> 14:25.990
A show of talents.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.368
And a-one and a-two.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.869
[deep breath]

14:29.952 --> 14:30.952
[howls]

14:30.995 --> 14:34.624
[liyotes howl]

14:37.877 --> 14:39.212
Ah.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.840
Amber must admit,
you guys pretty talented.

14:42.924 --> 14:46.260
Amber go rehearse
Amber comedy for talent show.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.513
- [chuckles]
- So, where were we?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.140
Oh, right.
You were growling, I was scared.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.517
[gasps]

14:52.600 --> 14:53.643
For me?

14:54.560 --> 14:58.815
Well, I haven't eaten
since breakfast number three, so...

14:59.732 --> 15:02.819
Whoa, you guys
can eat almost as fast as me.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.070
Wanna race?

15:05.947 --> 15:07.740
[gagging]

15:10.910 --> 15:11.744
[coughs]

15:11.828 --> 15:14.705
[gasps]
Wow, thanks, guys, that was so...

15:14.789 --> 15:16.290
so friendly.

15:16.374 --> 15:20.002
Okay, I know they seem friendly in
their actions and their cute dumb faces,

15:20.086 --> 15:22.880
but I swear,
liyotes are nothing but trouble.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.716
No, hey, don't you waft me away,
young man.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.677
Got any plans this afternoon?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.470
[panting]

15:30.555 --> 15:32.598
- [grunting]
- [panting]

15:32.682 --> 15:33.558
[barks]

15:33.641 --> 15:35.226
[panting]

15:35.309 --> 15:37.061
[growling]

15:41.482 --> 15:43.484
You guys do this, too?

15:44.819 --> 15:47.697
[liyotes howling]

15:47.780 --> 15:49.699
[Thunk howling]

15:52.076 --> 15:56.330
Hope you're hungry, Croods,
'cause I whipped up my specialty tonight.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.166
Ah, aged girelephant.

15:58.249 --> 16:01.210
Tastes almost as good going down
as it does coming back up.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.130
Well, well, if we're fine dining,

16:04.213 --> 16:09.010
I think I'll dip into my stash
of rare amber-encased smash fruits.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.803
Real top-branch stuff.

16:10.887 --> 16:11.721
[sniffs]

16:11.804 --> 16:13.806
Mmm.
Good era.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.850
You gonna share some
with the rest of us, Mom?

16:15.933 --> 16:21.063
Oh, sweetie, I think
we both know the answer to that.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.025
[groans]

16:24.108 --> 16:26.777
Oh, there you are, Thunk.
I was worried.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.071
Come and get dinner
before the flies lay eggs in it.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.073
That's okay.
I already ate.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.618
You did?
Where did you get the food?

16:33.701 --> 16:36.913
Oh, uh...
from some new friends I made.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.957
That's terrific!
Who are they?

16:40.041 --> 16:41.834
It'd be great to meet their parents.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.003
Uh, they don't have parents.

16:44.086 --> 16:44.921
Nailed it.

16:45.004 --> 16:45.880
[sniffing]

16:45.963 --> 16:47.882
Sandy, be cool.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.634
[growls, barks]

16:51.719 --> 16:53.054
[barks]

16:53.137 --> 16:54.137
Uh...

16:55.014 --> 16:57.683
- Whoa, whoa, down, girl, down.
- No, Thunk! No, no, heel!

16:57.767 --> 16:58.851
She started it.

16:58.935 --> 17:03.481
Maybe, but we expect her
to attack people, she's a baby.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.983
You...
What's gotten into you, Thunk?

17:06.067 --> 17:07.818
[sniffs]

17:07.902 --> 17:10.195
He's been hanging out with liyotes!

17:10.279 --> 17:11.321
[sniffs, gasps]

17:11.405 --> 17:13.324
Smell it ain't so, Thunk.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.242
Young man, what have I always told you?

17:15.326 --> 17:16.536
Liyotes are trouble.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.371
No, they're not.
They're my friends.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.165
Wrong. They only pretend
to be your friend for food.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.083
That's not true.

17:22.165 --> 17:25.044
You don't even know
Fang, Grr, and Gary.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.127
Gary?

17:26.212 --> 17:31.384
My son isn't hanging around
with some troublemaker named "Gary."

17:31.467 --> 17:32.677
Go to your corner!

17:33.427 --> 17:34.845
[sniffling]

17:34.929 --> 17:37.139
[sobbing]

17:40.434 --> 17:43.020
Well, this dinner's ruined.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.565
I'm out of my favorite red.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.903
Dad's so wrong.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.321
Liyotes aren't bad.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.782
They're beautiful creatures,
capable of greatness.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.284
[growling]

17:57.201 --> 17:58.536
Hey, guys.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.746
What you peein' on?

18:00.830 --> 18:01.831
Nice.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.624
Then let's get markin'.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.626
[straining]

18:05.710 --> 18:07.503
I could just never go on cue.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.796
[hissing]

18:11.132 --> 18:12.883
[shouts]
Crabby-tabbies!

18:12.967 --> 18:13.967
- [hissing]
- [snarling]

18:14.719 --> 18:16.053
Oh, you wanna go?

18:16.137 --> 18:17.138
It's on!

18:17.221 --> 18:18.472
[barking]

18:19.265 --> 18:21.142
- [groaning]
- [meowing]

18:23.269 --> 18:24.854
[whimpering]

18:24.937 --> 18:25.938
[gasps]

18:30.860 --> 18:32.528
[whimpering]

18:36.782 --> 18:41.203
[laughs] Man, we kicked
their furry, scaly butts.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.287
[Eep] Thunk?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.457
[snarling]

18:44.540 --> 18:46.334
Guys, guys, she's cool.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.211
You're still hanging out
with these mangy fleabags?

18:49.295 --> 18:52.089
Whoa.
She is not cool.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.800
[scoffs] You know
they're not your friends.

18:54.884 --> 18:55.884
They are, too.

18:55.926 --> 19:00.806
They listen to my stories,
yip at my jokes, keep me clean.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.558
[giggles]

19:03.559 --> 19:05.895
All they care about is food.

19:05.978 --> 19:06.978
That's not true.

19:07.605 --> 19:08.605
[panting]

19:10.274 --> 19:12.360
Hey!
I was doing sports with that.

19:12.443 --> 19:13.443
[grunting]

19:13.736 --> 19:15.946
Scram, you lousy egg-nappers.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.032
- [snarling]
- Uh...

19:18.991 --> 19:19.991
[growling]

19:21.619 --> 19:22.870
[growling]

19:22.953 --> 19:23.953
You scram.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.123
This is my friends' territory.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.207
[sighs]

19:27.249 --> 19:28.084
Let's go.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.418
Yeah.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.505
[Womp] I kinda like the licking.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.007
She thinks we only care about food.

19:35.091 --> 19:35.966
Yeah, right.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.093
[stomachs growling]

19:37.176 --> 19:41.055
But all this talk about food
is making me hungry.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.973
I think I know where we can grab a bite.

19:45.226 --> 19:48.896
I know we got some snacky bugs
around here somewhere.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.650
Hey, Fang,
that's Dad's favorite gnawing bone.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.695
And, Grr, those are clothes.
You can't eat them.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.446
Believe me, I've tried.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.240
Gary?

19:59.323 --> 20:00.616
Oh, where are you, girl?

20:01.409 --> 20:02.743
Gary?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.497
[gasps]
Gran's secret stash.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.166
[gasps]
Sorry, you can't eat these.

20:09.250 --> 20:13.713
Gran would get very emotional
and that emotion would be murderous rage.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.758
Guys, come on.

20:17.842 --> 20:21.011
Defy the stereotype
and your natural impulses.

20:22.847 --> 20:23.889
[yelps]

20:23.973 --> 20:26.183
[rumbling]

20:27.977 --> 20:29.478
[groans]

20:30.146 --> 20:31.772
Gah!
Booby-trapped.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.483
Help get this off me
before Gran gets home.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.114
Hey, guys.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.783
Guys!
What about the good times?

20:42.867 --> 20:45.911
Did all that butt-scooting
mean nothing to you?

20:46.662 --> 20:50.166
[sighs] Guess you were right
about those liyotes, thought-bubble Dad.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.461
Of course, son, because never forget,
I know everything.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.212
[straining]

20:55.296 --> 20:57.298
So, what do I do about this boulder?

20:57.381 --> 20:58.424
Ooh, good question.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.385
- The answer is...
- Who are you talking to?

21:01.469 --> 21:04.180
Eep!
[sighs] You were right, too.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.599
I thought the liyotes were my friends,

21:06.682 --> 21:10.853
but it turns out we were just
acquaintances who all like food.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.940
Well, I'm just sorry it took a giant
boulder crushing your torso

21:15.024 --> 21:16.734
for you to realize that.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.361
[straining]

21:21.238 --> 21:22.239
[groans]

21:22.323 --> 21:23.324
Gran doesn't mess around.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.742
- [growling]
- Gary?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.704
Fang, Grr, you guys came back!

21:28.788 --> 21:30.372
[laughing]

21:30.456 --> 21:31.832
And you brought help.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.626
[laughing]

21:33.709 --> 21:37.421
Oh, I thought you said
he was trapped under a shoulder.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.215
This makes way more sense.
Okay.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.217
[straining]

21:41.300 --> 21:43.761
[gasps]
You really are my friends.

21:45.971 --> 21:49.642
And I guess you guys at least
like me enough not to let me die.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.102
No.
We are your friends, too.

21:52.186 --> 21:55.981
Just 'cause we get annoyed at you playing
Egg Toss doesn't change that.

21:56.065 --> 21:59.693
Besides, Womp's way more annoying
and we stay friends with him.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.613
Yeah, I'm way more annoying, buddy.

22:02.696 --> 22:06.575
Wow, so now I have human friends
and liyote friends.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.913
Nope, they were just in it for the food.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.706
[panting]

22:15.376 --> 22:17.503
[snarling]

22:17.586 --> 22:20.464
[whimpering]

22:20.548 --> 22:24.468
Huh, how'd they get around
both my booby-traps?

22:24.552 --> 22:26.804
[rumbling]

22:27.221 --> 22:29.557
[screaming]

22:32.810 --> 22:34.311
Ha!
That's better.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.395
[screaming]

22:35.437 --> 22:36.981
[coughing]

22:37.064 --> 22:38.983
[laughing]
Whoo!
