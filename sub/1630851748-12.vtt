00:12.583 --> 00:14.583
[engine idling]

00:15.791 --> 00:19.125
Okay, kids, I'm gonna be away
for a few weeks with BTG and Bonnie.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.041
And Margie will be here any minute.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.375
We need to look our best.

00:22.458 --> 00:24.791
Are you kids ready to meet your mom?

00:24.875 --> 00:26.250
Brian, stop slouching.

00:26.333 --> 00:27.750
[horn honking]

00:28.416 --> 00:31.833
Dietrich, get a move on,
or we'll miss the great caribou migration.

00:31.916 --> 00:34.666
Be good for your mom. Stay out of the sun!

00:36.666 --> 00:38.041
[blizzard whooshing]

00:38.125 --> 00:41.791
[BTG] <i>We were deep in the snow-covered</i>
<i>tundra of Canada's Yukon Territory,</i>

00:41.875 --> 00:45.750
<i>following a mysterious map left to me</i>
<i>by my mother, Bunny T. Greive,</i>

00:45.833 --> 00:48.208
<i>who vanished 35 years earlier.</i>

00:48.291 --> 00:49.625
Almost there!

00:49.708 --> 00:51.000
[Bonnie] Almost where?

00:51.083 --> 00:54.541
I can't see a thing!
Everything looks exactly the same.

00:54.625 --> 00:56.875
What do you see? Are we in danger?

00:56.958 --> 00:59.958
What? I can't hear you over the blizzard!

01:00.041 --> 01:02.416
There's a snow lizard? Oh God!

01:02.500 --> 01:05.000
It's gonna crawl down my throat
and freeze my windpipe.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.750
I can't hear what you're saying!

01:06.833 --> 01:10.250
I'm just gonna assume it's so dumb
that I'm better off not knowing.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.083
[adventurous music playing]

01:12.166 --> 01:14.041
[BTG] According to my mom's coordinates,

01:14.125 --> 01:17.500
there should be
a Greive family crest nearby.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.750
Ugh! Damn this icy dandruff.

01:20.833 --> 01:22.750
Bradley!

01:23.458 --> 01:25.166
Bradley!

01:25.250 --> 01:28.708
Mom? Is that you?
We all thought you were dead.

01:28.791 --> 01:31.916
Bradley! I knew you'd find me.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.166
Oh, Mom! There's so much I wanna ask you.

01:35.250 --> 01:37.375
Am I the man you wanted me to be?

01:37.458 --> 01:39.916
What is it with chickpeas?
They make no sense.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.250
When will I stop missing you?

01:42.333 --> 01:43.833
Bradley!

01:44.458 --> 01:46.500
Embrace your ignorance.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.750
It's your best quality.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.625
As in keep searching for knowledge?

01:51.708 --> 01:52.666
Maybe.

01:53.208 --> 01:54.125
Sure.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.875
-Bradley!
-[Bonnie] Uncle B!

01:56.958 --> 01:58.375
Uncle B!

01:58.458 --> 02:00.375
Does anyone hear that clicking?

02:00.458 --> 02:02.791
[clicking]

02:02.875 --> 02:05.375
Oh, sorry. I have double-jointed thumbs.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.458
[clicking]

02:06.541 --> 02:09.250
No, no, that's not
your deformed thumb music.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.916
That's a herd of reindeer.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.666
They have tendons in their feet
that make a clicking noise when they walk.

02:14.750 --> 02:17.250
The noise tells other reindeer
how big they are

02:17.333 --> 02:19.166
and helps the herd stay together,

02:19.250 --> 02:21.208
even in a whiteout blizzard.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.291
-[loud rumbling]
-[all screaming]

02:28.541 --> 02:30.125
[gasps] Oh my God.

02:31.083 --> 02:32.416
[BTG] Ha! Don't worry.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.666
It's a prosthetic nipple.
This isn't my first reindeer run-in.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.458
[howling in distance]

02:39.208 --> 02:40.333
[Bonnie gasps] Wolves!

02:40.416 --> 02:41.958
Move! They eat stragglers!

02:42.041 --> 02:44.875
But I ate all those sausages! [grunts]

02:45.458 --> 02:47.458
[howling]

02:49.250 --> 02:52.250
[grunts] The wolves are howling
to coordinate their attack.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.333
Watch for an ambush!

02:53.416 --> 02:55.041
[wolves growling]

02:55.125 --> 02:58.625
Please go faster!
They can tell I'm full of sausage meat!

02:58.708 --> 03:00.541

Go away, you damned wolves!

03:19.583 --> 03:21.166
[howling]

03:21.250 --> 03:23.208
[growling]

03:23.291 --> 03:25.041
Ha-ha! Yes!

03:25.125 --> 03:27.375
I was afraid those snooty Canadian wolves

03:27.458 --> 03:31.041
would pretend that they didn't understand
my Filipina-American accent.

03:31.791 --> 03:32.791
Hmm.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.083
Ah-ha!

03:36.083 --> 03:38.083
-[grunting]
-[bird chittering]

03:41.833 --> 03:44.583
-Are we sure the wolves are gone?
-Ha! Don't worry.

03:44.666 --> 03:47.208
-I told them to leave us alone.
-[bird chittering]

03:47.291 --> 03:51.375
Leave us alone?
So, what? You can talk to animals now?

03:51.458 --> 03:54.375
I'd call it commune with nature, but sure.

03:54.458 --> 03:58.000
Animals can't talk, Bonnie.
Otherwise, I'd know why my cat hates me.

03:58.083 --> 03:59.875
That's not true. Look at that bird.

03:59.958 --> 04:03.500
She's saying, "Dietrich, it's me, Maria."

04:03.583 --> 04:05.250
"Why didn't you reply to my texts?"

04:05.333 --> 04:08.666
Heh! Whoa. Did you ghost that bird?

04:08.750 --> 04:11.750
What? That bird doesn't know me!
Shut up, Maria!

04:11.833 --> 04:14.125
BTG, tell Bonnie birds can't talk!

04:14.208 --> 04:15.833
That's a black-capped chickadee.

04:15.916 --> 04:18.166
They chirp the same thing
over and over again,

04:18.250 --> 04:20.041
and it kinda sounds like "chick-a-dee."

04:20.125 --> 04:22.250
Ipso facto, they're called chickadees.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.333
See, Bonnie?

04:23.416 --> 04:26.291
That dumb bird
is just saying its own name over and over.

04:26.375 --> 04:27.333
[BTG] Oh no.

04:27.416 --> 04:29.250
She's saying much more than that.

04:29.333 --> 04:33.875
Chickadees subtly add extra "D" sounds
to their standard call to indicate danger.

04:33.958 --> 04:36.375
The more "D's,"
the more serious the threat.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.333
-[clanking]
-Whoa! Ah!

04:38.416 --> 04:40.958
-I think I found it.
-Oh, thank God.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.541
I need to defrost my underwear.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.958
I can't wait to see
what Grandma Bunny left us.

04:45.041 --> 04:48.083
Do you think it's the key
to a secret crypt full of cursed bones?

04:48.166 --> 04:51.291
Mmm, that's very specific, and no.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.333
It's some kind of time capsule.

04:53.416 --> 04:54.916
Could be a bone key in there.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.750
[chickadee chittering]

04:56.833 --> 05:00.125
-Uh-oh. That's a whole lot of "D's."
-[wolves howling]

05:02.875 --> 05:04.416
Up the tree! Now!

-[screaming]

05:07.416 --> 05:08.625
[whimpering]

05:08.708 --> 05:10.541
[growling]

05:10.625 --> 05:13.000
Why are animals
constantly trying to eat me?

05:13.083 --> 05:15.041
Mmm, what have we got here?

05:15.125 --> 05:17.583
Looks like there's a passcode.
Six letters…

05:17.666 --> 05:20.750
Passcode? Maybe we should worry
about the ravenous wolves first.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.625
They're not ravenous. Listen.

05:22.708 --> 05:24.250
-[growling]
-That one is saying,

05:24.333 --> 05:26.583
"Dietrich, it's me, Sharon."

05:27.083 --> 05:30.291
"How could you leave me and the kids
after all you promised?"

05:30.375 --> 05:33.458
Dietrich, uh, is this wolf your wife?

05:33.541 --> 05:36.291
No way! I would never marry a wolf.

05:36.375 --> 05:38.750
Hmm. There's an inscription.

05:38.833 --> 05:41.541
"The password couldn't be easier."

05:41.625 --> 05:42.500
Easier…

05:43.083 --> 05:45.333
A, B, C, D, E, F.

05:45.416 --> 05:46.833
-[electricity zapping]
-[screams]

05:46.916 --> 05:49.166
-Oh, Uncle B!
-I can't look down!

05:49.250 --> 05:50.833
-It's so toothy!
-[barking]

05:50.916 --> 05:53.458
Ooh! I've never seen wolves
from this perspective.

05:53.541 --> 05:54.416
-[barks]
-[screams]

05:54.500 --> 05:56.041
[chittering]

05:56.125 --> 05:57.875
Yes, we know, Maria!

05:57.958 --> 06:00.791
Sharon, if you ever loved me,
you'll stop this right now!

06:00.875 --> 06:02.416
-[growling]
-[groaning]

06:02.500 --> 06:05.250
[grunting] Help me, Dietrich.
Or we're all dog food.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.750
I'm helping! I'm helping!

06:06.833 --> 06:08.041
[grunting, squeals]

06:08.125 --> 06:09.208
My dancing thumbs!

06:09.291 --> 06:12.791
[laughs] Oh, Mom. You never liked
to make anything easy, did you?

06:12.875 --> 06:13.875
[snarling]

06:15.750 --> 06:17.291
Bradley!

06:17.375 --> 06:19.583
Mom, you're a wolf ghost?

06:19.666 --> 06:22.375
Yes! I always knew I had wolf blood in me.

06:22.458 --> 06:25.916
The password couldn't be easier.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.583
What does that even mean?

06:27.666 --> 06:29.916
The password couldn't be easier.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.583
Chicka-dee-dee-dee!

06:31.666 --> 06:33.625
-[both screaming]
-[both hit the ground]

06:33.708 --> 06:36.166
You got it, my boy.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.291
[snarls]

06:38.000 --> 06:39.375
-E-A-S-I-E-R.
-[beeping]

06:39.458 --> 06:40.666
[whooshing]

06:40.750 --> 06:42.125
[whistling, bursting]

06:42.208 --> 06:43.416
Yes! Success!

06:44.375 --> 06:47.125
[whirring, beeping]

06:47.208 --> 06:50.125
Is it one big bone key
or a whole rattly bone key ring?

06:50.208 --> 06:51.625
There are no bone keys.

06:51.708 --> 06:56.000
It's some kind of homing beacon
and more coordinates.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.958
It looks like we have to go to the Congo.

07:00.041 --> 07:03.541
Geez! Grandma Bunny really didn't want
anyone to find this thing.

07:05.416 --> 07:08.125
[BTG] <i>After securing</i>
<i>my mom's homing beacon,</i>

07:08.208 --> 07:10.958
<i>we set course for the Congo River Basin.</i>

07:11.041 --> 07:14.708
<i>There, we hope to finally unearth</i>
<i>her buried secret.</i>

07:14.791 --> 07:16.208
[birds calling]

07:16.291 --> 07:17.583
[vocalizing]

07:17.666 --> 07:18.833
What are you doing?

07:18.916 --> 07:21.250
Do you need a throat lozenge?
Because I'm all out.

07:21.916 --> 07:23.666
Mmm. Soothing.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.583
[scoffs] I'm calling a shoebill stork.

07:25.666 --> 07:27.000
[scoffs] Obviously.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.833
[vocalizing]

07:29.416 --> 07:31.166
[bill-clattering]

07:31.250 --> 07:34.416
[spits] Stop summoning
prehistoric bird monsters.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.375
I'm not summoning them, just saying hello.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.500
[sniffing]

07:39.125 --> 07:40.333
Hippos.

07:41.500 --> 07:45.208
Uncle B, that's an empty river.
Are you having a senior moment?

07:45.291 --> 07:47.041
No, Bonnie, not the river.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.458
The fecal matter inside the river.

07:49.541 --> 07:52.375
I've gotta say,
you've got a good eye for fecal matter.

07:52.458 --> 07:55.208
Animal waste
is chock-full of personal information,

07:55.291 --> 07:57.208
such as age, gender, health, diet.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.791
It's why pandas pee
while doing a headstand.

07:59.875 --> 08:04.416
The male giant panda marks its territory
by peeing on large trees.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.958
Okay, nothing special about that.
Your dog does the exact same thing.

08:08.041 --> 08:10.250
But a giant panda pees

08:10.333 --> 08:11.875
while doing a headstand.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.833
[laughing] Oh, that's nice.

08:13.916 --> 08:17.125
The reason for this
is the higher he can pee on a tree,

08:17.208 --> 08:21.208
the bigger he'll appear to other pandas
who come by later to smell his scent.

08:21.291 --> 08:25.666
And this will impress his female admirers
and intimidate his male rivals.

08:26.416 --> 08:27.791
[urinating] Ahh.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.333
Rhinos will all defecate in the same spot

08:31.416 --> 08:34.208
as a way of passing information
on to the group.

08:34.291 --> 08:38.541
It's like an online message board
composed completely of feces.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.833
So, basically
a regular online message board.

08:40.916 --> 08:42.000
Exactly.

08:42.083 --> 08:45.500
Ah, there you go.
We'll take this sample back to base camp.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.666
Ew. That doesn't seem sanitary.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.416
Yeah, I probably should have washed
that container.

08:50.916 --> 08:52.916
[beeping]

08:53.666 --> 08:54.666
We're close.

08:55.375 --> 08:58.916
Mmm, the capsule
must be under this boulder.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.875
-I'll find a branch to use as a lever.
-[laughs] No need, Bonnie.

09:02.958 --> 09:07.583
I was the 2006 Rock-Lifting Champion
of Haapiti, French Polynesia.

09:08.666 --> 09:10.666
Hoo! [grunting]

09:13.833 --> 09:15.000
-[grunts]
-[thuds]

09:15.083 --> 09:17.916
God, that's heavy!
I think I sprained a sphincter.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.500
-[leaves rustling]
-Oh God! Rustling leaves!

09:20.583 --> 09:21.625
[growling]

09:21.708 --> 09:24.375
[BTG] Gorillas aren't usually aggressive,
unless threatened.

09:24.458 --> 09:25.666
He's just making a nest.

09:26.291 --> 09:28.875
[exhales, grunts]

09:29.583 --> 09:32.583
Come on!

09:32.666 --> 09:34.583
-Oh!
-[screams]

09:35.333 --> 09:36.291
I'm being eaten!

09:36.375 --> 09:39.125
Sky worm! Sky worm!

09:39.208 --> 09:41.833
[laughs] This is definitely Mom's style.

09:41.916 --> 09:43.458
Oh God.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.541
[chuffing]

09:45.375 --> 09:47.833
Oh no! He's gonna split my banana!

09:47.916 --> 09:49.500
It's okay. It's okay.

09:49.583 --> 09:52.666
Just be careful what you say
and how you say it.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.958
Gorillas have
complex communication systems.

09:55.041 --> 09:58.041
They make 25 different sounds,
use hand signals,

09:58.125 --> 09:59.958
even develop regional slang.

10:00.041 --> 10:03.208
I don't speak gorilla!
I only took French in high school.

10:03.291 --> 10:05.791
[sings in French]

10:07.875 --> 10:08.791
[screeching]

10:08.875 --> 10:10.875
Hey! Stop singing, Dietrich!

10:10.958 --> 10:13.333
You're making
the whole rainforest miserable!

10:16.375 --> 10:17.875
[sniffing]

10:20.208 --> 10:21.583
[inhales deeply]

10:23.208 --> 10:25.333
[chattering]

10:25.416 --> 10:26.666
[BTG] Well done, Bonnie!

10:26.750 --> 10:30.125
[sighs] Wow! That worked out a lot better
than my babysitting gig.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.583
I've almost got you, Dietrich.

10:31.666 --> 10:34.291
There's just two ropes left,
the brown one and the bright red one.

10:34.375 --> 10:37.333
Of course, in nature,
bright colors usually mean danger, so…

10:37.875 --> 10:39.708
Heh. [screams]

10:39.791 --> 10:40.666
Ooh.

10:43.208 --> 10:44.333
[grunting]

10:44.416 --> 10:45.500
I got you.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.541
[screams]

10:47.625 --> 10:49.375
What? They were all traps?

10:49.458 --> 10:52.000
Where are these ropes even coming from?

10:52.083 --> 10:53.916
Sky worms always travel in threes.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.125
Sky worms aren't real, Dietrich!

10:56.208 --> 10:57.125
Aw.

10:57.666 --> 10:59.666
[singing in French]

11:02.750 --> 11:04.750
[both singing in French]

11:05.458 --> 11:07.166
[humming]

11:08.000 --> 11:09.125
I'm in hell.

11:09.625 --> 11:10.750
[singing continues]

11:10.833 --> 11:14.166
[Bonnie] Ugh! How long is this song?

11:20.958 --> 11:22.125
Hmm?

11:22.208 --> 11:24.916
Mom! Tell us how to get out
of your contraption.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.583
Remember the wood turtles.

11:27.666 --> 11:29.041
What? Why?

11:29.875 --> 11:31.083
[ground rumbling]

11:31.166 --> 11:33.125
[trumpetting]

11:33.208 --> 11:35.208
[all screaming]

11:36.208 --> 11:37.791
African forest elephants.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.375
Be very quiet.

11:39.458 --> 11:43.083
These guys are not your typical elephant.
They're incredibly violent.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.416
Thank God.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.333
Please put a big, sharp tusk
straight through my ears.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.416
[elephants rumbling]

11:50.166 --> 11:51.375
[gasps] That's it!

11:51.458 --> 11:54.708
Bonnie, remember when we tagged
those wood turtles in Nova Scotia?

11:54.791 --> 11:57.250
Of course, I could never forget that.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.833
Wood turtles stomp their feet
and slam their bellies on the ground

12:00.916 --> 12:03.250
to mimic the vibration of falling rain.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.666
This tricks earthworms
to come to the surface to avoid drowning.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.791
[grunting, yelping]

12:09.875 --> 12:12.541
Actually, I don't remember that at all.

12:12.625 --> 12:15.000
Elephants can feel
the vibrations of falling fruit

12:15.083 --> 12:16.291
via their feet.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.208
We need them to come over here.

12:18.916 --> 12:20.916
[grunting]

12:23.375 --> 12:25.541
[continues grunting]

12:28.958 --> 12:30.333
[elephants trumpeting]

12:30.916 --> 12:32.000
Attagirl.

12:34.416 --> 12:35.625
-[hits the ground]
-[BTG grunts]

12:36.333 --> 12:37.458
Whoa! [grunts]

12:39.708 --> 12:41.750
-[rumbling]
-Uh…

12:41.833 --> 12:43.166
Am I doing it right?

12:43.250 --> 12:45.708
-[branch snaps]
-Whoa! [groans]

12:47.083 --> 12:50.500
Uncle B? It's getting dark.
We should probably hurry.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.416
[chattering]

12:52.500 --> 12:54.750
[BTG] Owl-faced monkeys
and red river hogs.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.625
They must be attracted by the fruit.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.000
Okay.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.541
[yelling]

12:59.625 --> 13:00.791
[farts]

13:04.208 --> 13:06.083
[grunting]

13:06.833 --> 13:07.916
Hold this.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.208
[cracking knuckles]

13:09.291 --> 13:11.958
[grunting, yelling]

13:12.041 --> 13:13.750
[both cheering]

13:14.416 --> 13:15.583
[Dietrich] Show that rock!

13:15.666 --> 13:17.666
Oh! [grunts]

13:18.166 --> 13:20.083
Put the boulder down, Uncle B!

13:20.166 --> 13:22.625
Can't crush the monkeys!

13:22.708 --> 13:24.666
Just put it down! The monkeys will move.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.791
Can't take that chance!

13:27.375 --> 13:28.458
[screams]

13:28.541 --> 13:29.541
Oh! Holy crap!

13:29.625 --> 13:33.625
Your big, beautiful hairy arms!
You need those to save me constantly.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.000
[beeping]

13:35.083 --> 13:36.083
The beacon!

13:36.166 --> 13:39.125
The time capsule isn't under the rock,
it's inside the rock.

13:39.208 --> 13:41.541
Bonnie, there's a rock hammer
inside my beard.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.666
[Bonnie grunts]

13:43.208 --> 13:46.208
This is the tiniest hammer I've ever seen.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.750
[grunting]

13:50.291 --> 13:52.750
Uh, where'd all the monkeys go?

13:53.375 --> 13:54.708
Why is it so quiet?

13:54.791 --> 13:57.916
Silence is the most foreboding
of all communication.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.333
When animals stop talking,

13:59.416 --> 14:02.958
they're telling you
something's wrong, very wrong.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.083
[animal roaring]

14:05.166 --> 14:06.833
[gasps] Hippos.

14:06.916 --> 14:09.083
If those hippos find us
in their territory,

14:09.166 --> 14:10.291
they'll obliterate us.

14:10.375 --> 14:13.583
Come on, you stupid rock! Ugh!

14:13.666 --> 14:15.666
-[hippos roaring]
-There's no time!

14:15.750 --> 14:18.500
Let's just leave BTG here to die.
You don't mind, right?

14:18.583 --> 14:19.708
Bonnie, my beard.

14:19.791 --> 14:22.125
There's pastels. And get the hippo feces.

14:22.208 --> 14:25.541
Ugh! Mixed media art just means
you've run out of ideas.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.541
[grunts] Now what?

14:28.625 --> 14:32.083
-Take the pastels and draw a hippo face.
-On it.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.875
Dietrich, rub the hippo feces
all over the boulder.

14:36.416 --> 14:39.208
-Um, I'm swapping jobs with Bonnie.
-[BTG] Fine.

14:40.416 --> 14:42.333
[gags] Oh God, it stinks.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.416
Oh God. Is it too angry?

14:46.500 --> 14:47.916
Is it too hopeful?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.500
I can't judge my own work.

14:49.583 --> 14:50.750
Dietrich, what the hell?

14:50.833 --> 14:54.291
-Is that Melon Baby's face?
-It's the only thing I know how to draw.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.875
-[rumbling]
-[growling]

14:55.958 --> 14:57.625
So, this is how it ends.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.125
We don't all have to die today.
Get out of here!

15:00.208 --> 15:01.500
Go! Now!

15:01.583 --> 15:02.875
-Whoa!
-[yelps]

15:02.958 --> 15:05.083
[Dietrich] I'm being trampled by hippos!

15:05.166 --> 15:06.958
No one could have ever predicted this!

15:07.041 --> 15:08.416
-[rock breaks]
-Yes!

15:08.500 --> 15:10.250
-[growling]
-[screaming]

15:11.375 --> 15:12.708
Dietrich!

15:14.625 --> 15:15.750
[grunts]

15:23.791 --> 15:24.916
Dietrich's fanny pack!

15:25.000 --> 15:28.250
He'd never leave this behind
if he was… alive.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.916
No! No! No, no, no, no!
This can't be happening!

15:32.500 --> 15:34.458
Dietrich! Dietrich!

15:34.541 --> 15:35.916
[suspenseful music playing]

15:36.875 --> 15:38.041
Dietrich!

15:38.125 --> 15:39.916
-[gasps] Good news.
-What is it?

15:40.000 --> 15:43.125
I've recovered Dietrich's watch.
We'll send it to his grandmother.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.791
Uh, Dietrich never wore a watch.

15:45.875 --> 15:49.750
Oh. Then I have more good news.
Dietrich may still be alive.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.958
And there must be
West African crocodiles in this river.

15:57.666 --> 15:58.791
[yelps]

15:58.875 --> 16:00.958
We really should get out of the water.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.791
Agh! This makes no sense.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.250
It never does.

16:07.333 --> 16:10.291
Dietrich just wanted
to be a professor at UC Davis!

16:10.375 --> 16:12.041
I can never save them.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.833
[Bunny] Bradley!

16:14.791 --> 16:16.416
Don't blame yourself.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.541
Mom?

16:17.625 --> 16:18.791
Come on, now.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.583
This is who we are.

16:20.666 --> 16:23.333
No Greive zoologist ever died of old age.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.541
This is why it's so important
to write our books,

16:26.625 --> 16:30.541
to communicate all we've learned
to the next BTG,

16:30.625 --> 16:32.583
before it's too late.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.083
Goodbye, Bradley!

16:35.750 --> 16:36.875
Goodbye, Mom.

16:37.458 --> 16:38.875
[bill-clattering]

16:43.000 --> 16:45.750
[sighs] I wonder who my book will be for.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.083
[groovy music playing]

16:55.375 --> 16:56.250
[sighs]

16:56.875 --> 16:58.250
[breathes deeply]

16:58.333 --> 16:59.958
-[whispering]
-[BTG] And so…

17:00.708 --> 17:03.041
the Greive family legend
continues to be built,

17:03.125 --> 17:04.583
one book at a time.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.583
End of book one.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.500
Book two to come.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.125
[recorder clicks]

17:10.833 --> 17:11.958
[chuckles]

17:12.041 --> 17:14.333
[smacks lips] I have so much more
to tell you.

17:14.416 --> 17:15.625
[munching]

17:16.958 --> 17:18.041
Hmm.

17:20.208 --> 17:22.208
[groovy music continues]
