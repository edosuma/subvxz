00:01.871 --> 00:03.612
Previously
onBlack Lightning...

00:03.655 --> 00:06.745
Besides Gravedigger,
how many metas
are stable enough to fight?

00:06.789 --> 00:07.920
None, I'm afraid.

00:07.964 --> 00:10.010
Lynn's been kidnapped
by the Markovians.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.664
There is a substance
that Tobias' body produces

00:12.708 --> 00:14.927
that is key to making
the stabilization serum.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.494
I know that you have developed

00:16.538 --> 00:20.324
a meta stabilization
serum in America.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.326
You will prepare it
for us here.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.502
So there's a chip in him.
Why don't we just take it out?

00:24.546 --> 00:26.374
The chip is connected
to Khalil's brain.

00:26.417 --> 00:27.766
Removing it would kill him.

00:27.810 --> 00:28.637
Firewall.

00:35.383 --> 00:36.688
After everything
that's happened,

00:36.732 --> 00:38.342
how could you
possibly work with them?

00:38.386 --> 00:40.692
Because getting her back
is the only thing that matters.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.173
Listen up.
We're going on to foreign soil

00:43.217 --> 00:45.958
to engage a ruthless enemy
who knows we're coming.

00:46.002 --> 00:49.179
So the ASA support
is our best chance
of getting in and out alive.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.093
Let's get to work.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.056
Black Lightning.

01:41.797 --> 01:45.453
"Black Lightning"!

01:47.281 --> 01:50.806
Never particularly cared
for that name.

01:52.808 --> 01:53.635
The news...

01:55.202 --> 01:56.290
News called me that,

01:57.291 --> 01:58.640
twenty-two years ago...

02:00.990 --> 02:01.817
and it stuck.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.080
Twenty-two years.

02:05.647 --> 02:06.822
Feels like a thousand...

02:11.000 --> 02:12.132
and then some.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.841
All the blood,

02:28.496 --> 02:29.497
broken bones,

02:30.933 --> 02:33.675
Broken hearts...

02:35.329 --> 02:36.156
and death.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.115
All the death.

02:42.553 --> 02:45.339
There was Lynn,
witness to it all.

02:47.123 --> 02:50.996
We tried to balance
a normal life,

02:51.040 --> 02:53.999
you know, kids, career.

02:54.043 --> 03:00.658
But nothing...
Nothing mixes well
with Black Lightning.

03:00.702 --> 03:01.572
So, we fought.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.141
We made up...

03:07.056 --> 03:10.190
got divorced,
got back together.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.368
Just couldn't stop
loving each other.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.345
I grew up around...

03:35.389 --> 03:38.087
drug dealers and drug addicts.
You know all that. Man...

03:39.610 --> 03:42.918
I've seen drugs
devastate people,

03:44.180 --> 03:45.050
families...

03:46.922 --> 03:48.402
I know the depth
of addiction.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.453
I also know...

03:58.281 --> 03:59.935
that Black Lightning's
powers are...

04:01.589 --> 04:03.199
useless in that fight.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.776
But they are not useless
in the fight

04:14.819 --> 04:16.168
in front of me right now.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.257
This war...

04:18.606 --> 04:19.433
for Freeland...

04:22.436 --> 04:25.395
This war for Freeland
took her from me.

04:25.439 --> 04:26.831
If I have to break bones,

04:28.964 --> 04:32.620
burn skin, draw blood...

04:33.621 --> 04:35.797
If I have to kill, I will.

04:38.626 --> 04:39.670
I'm getting her back.

04:41.629 --> 04:44.980
You're right, Jeff,
we'll get her back.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.461
Big day tomorrow.
You should get some sleep.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.247
Yeah.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.295
Yeah.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.601
♪ Last night
I saw a superhero
He was black ♪

04:57.645 --> 05:00.300
♪ He said
"This is for the street
Black Lightning's back" ♪

05:03.172 --> 05:05.783
-Well, you've got
nowhere to go but up.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.437
Why don't we just
reduce the difficulty

05:07.481 --> 05:08.612
until they get
the hang of it?

05:08.656 --> 05:10.614
This isn't a damn video game.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.660
We're training
for a mission
we cannot fail.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.097
Run it again.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.366
Mr. Pierce, a word.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.411
Major, I'm busy.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.065
Everything we have
on Painkiller.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.024
As agreed.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.506
And you'll provide amnesty
for my entire team?

05:33.507 --> 05:34.421
As agreed.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.163
Although your use
of the word "team"
is a joke.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.818
It takes weeks for
seasoned professionals

05:40.862 --> 05:42.167
to train for a rescue op.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.474
We have to launch this op
before the Markovians

05:44.518 --> 05:47.259
find a way
to force Dr. Stewart
to stabilize their metas,

05:47.303 --> 05:49.827
and half your people
can't fight their way out
of a paper bag.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.046
Let me worry about that.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.050
Say the word,
and I will give you

05:55.093 --> 05:57.226
my best ASA commandos.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.228
They'll get you
to the target,

06:00.055 --> 06:01.273
you can do the rest.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.318
My mission.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.233
My team.

06:11.109 --> 06:12.110
Good luck with that.

06:17.115 --> 06:20.728
This spectrometer
is in dire need of an upgrade.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.734
You haven't said
anything all morning.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.389
Are you not talking to me?

06:30.781 --> 06:34.698
My research shows that
friendly human connections

06:34.742 --> 06:36.744
start with a salutation
of some sort.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.920
So, good morning.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.967
I'm a prisoner,
miles from home.
So no, it isn't.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.797
Greetings, doctors.

06:48.451 --> 06:51.411
-Any progress?
-I'm afraid not.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.545
You will make
the stabilization serum.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.773
Kiss my ass.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.908
If you kill her,
she can't help us.

07:10.952 --> 07:13.128
Then, I'm just in time.

07:14.608 --> 07:15.435
Colonel.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.438
Heard about Dr. Stewart.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.569
I'll take it from here.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.442
This is my operation,
Gravedigger.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.921
I have things
well in hand.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.662
No, you don't.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.098
Note the presidential
signature.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.839
This is my operation now.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.754
You are under my command.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.930
I want a full briefing
of this facility.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.541
You have an hour
to get it together.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.979
Now, get the hell
out of my face.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.639
You've still not aged.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.207
Don't analyze me.

07:49.251 --> 07:51.688
I'm not one of your subjects
anymore, Jace.

07:51.732 --> 07:52.994
I won't say
it's good to see you,

07:53.037 --> 07:54.909
because... it isn't.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.346
Dr. Stewart.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.959
Your reputation
precedes you.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.221
Welcome to Markovia.

08:04.527 --> 08:05.485
You sound American.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.530
I was.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.619
But that's a long story
for later,

08:09.663 --> 08:11.012
after you've cured
my people.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.884
Your people?

08:13.928 --> 08:17.018
There are 94 meta-humans
here in pods

08:17.061 --> 08:19.847
who could live healthy lives
with your stabilization cure.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.849
You think I'm stupid?

08:22.676 --> 08:24.634
You're weaponizing them!

08:24.678 --> 08:25.635
Freedom ain't free.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.158
Spare me
the rationalization.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.160
I'm not open
to persuasion.

08:29.204 --> 08:32.686
It's...
It's interesting that
you'd say that.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.212
Make the cure
as fast as you can.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.056
What are you staring at?

09:07.068 --> 09:10.201
ASA troops continue
to patrol the streets...

09:10.245 --> 09:12.421
Hey.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.031
...protecting the citizens
from the Markovian
just outside our city.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.119
Hey.

09:16.904 --> 09:17.731
How you doing?

09:20.908 --> 09:21.909
Perfect.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.042
Just... catching up

09:25.086 --> 09:26.740
with what's going on
in the world.

09:29.307 --> 09:32.310
I feel like I've been
in a bubble for years.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.576
I know the timing's
really bad...

09:38.099 --> 09:40.101
but our rescue team
ain't looking so good.

09:41.015 --> 09:43.408
-I need to ask you a favor.
-No.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.628
No. No, the last thing
I need to do is

09:45.672 --> 09:47.151
go on another
kill mission again.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.110
Khalil, you know I'm not
asking you to kill anybody.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.200
This is to get my mom back.

09:54.506 --> 09:57.640
Please. You have
more training than
all of us put together.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.600
J, I want you to get
your mother back.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.254
Really, I do.

10:03.298 --> 10:07.084
But I am more
of a liability
than I am an asset.

10:07.128 --> 10:10.087
-What are you talking about?
-He's still in my head, Jen.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.480
I can't be trusted.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.526
We've both killed
for the ASA.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.487
But I lied
to my family about it.

10:18.530 --> 10:19.836
They've lied to me,

10:19.880 --> 10:22.143
Odell lied to you,
at least you've been honest.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.145
So, as far as I'm concerned,

10:25.146 --> 10:26.190
I trust you.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.149
I killed my own mother, Jen.

10:32.501 --> 10:33.545
Then help me save mine.

10:37.071 --> 10:37.985
Please.

10:40.901 --> 10:41.902
No.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.787
Are you experiencing
discomfort?

10:57.831 --> 10:59.354
A migraine, perhaps?

11:00.747 --> 11:01.661
Headache.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.185
Whole head or part?

11:05.708 --> 11:06.666
Front.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.670
You know what happened.
Tell me.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.716
That was Gravedigger.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.979
A meta-human with enhanced
strength and speed,

11:16.023 --> 11:18.678
with the power to push
whoever is in earshot.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.810
-"Push"?
-Mental domination.

11:20.854 --> 11:24.074
Auditory stimulation
overrides the frontal lobe.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.207
That's why I can't
stop working, even though
I don't want to.

11:29.776 --> 11:30.690
Give me the Glimmer.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.041
-What? Lynn, you're not--
-Just give it to me!

11:44.225 --> 11:46.053
Careful, or you'll OD. Lynn!

11:50.057 --> 11:51.014
Lynn?

11:51.058 --> 11:52.189
Lynn!

12:08.989 --> 12:10.512
I don't have to finish.

12:10.555 --> 12:13.384
The Glimmer causes
hyperactivity
in the frontal lobe.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.735
An antidote
to being pushed.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.214
Which means while he thinks
we're making the cure,

12:17.258 --> 12:18.389
we can make something else.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.304
Perhaps best
not to test it.

12:20.348 --> 12:23.046
Allow me to suggest
a man does not get
the name "Gravedigger"

12:23.090 --> 12:25.048
because he's kind and gentle.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.050
Then you better hope
we don't get caught.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.878
"We"? So we're bonding now?

12:28.922 --> 12:30.880
We're in the same boat
for now,

12:30.924 --> 12:32.490
but it has
a major leak in it.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.057
Resisting Gravedigger's push
isn't enough.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.972
We're gonna have to
use it to get out of here.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.209
Awkward.

13:03.478 --> 13:04.479
Stupid.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.225
...not eating nothing.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.967
-Hey.
-Hey, Jen.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.932
Really? You're still
holding on to this?

13:22.976 --> 13:25.630
All I was trying to do
was protect you.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.632
Well, since you're gonna
bring it up in front
of your girlfriend,

13:27.676 --> 13:29.634
I don't need protecting.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.941
All those times
you watched me
break down over Khalil,

13:31.985 --> 13:33.943
it never dawned on you
to tell me he's alive?

13:33.987 --> 13:35.292
Jen, I was about to, okay?

13:35.336 --> 13:37.207
But Painkiller
damn near killed me,

13:37.251 --> 13:39.470
he killed Tavon,
the damn thing
killed Khalil's mom.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.516
So, in my mind, Jen,
he was not alive.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.392
Look, I just figured you were
better off just not knowing.

13:48.436 --> 13:51.047
And you think
that's up to you
to decide for me?

13:53.006 --> 13:53.876
You're just like Dad.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.406
Hey, Jen.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.364
Yo.

14:06.889 --> 14:07.847
Hey.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.675
You better dig deep, dude.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.155
You've turned down
joining the fight

14:12.199 --> 14:13.678
in every simulation
we've run.

14:13.722 --> 14:14.854
Man, get out of my face.

14:16.377 --> 14:20.033
Every team is as good
as its weakest link.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.862
Just have the pride
to not consistently be it.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.994
Coming at me
with that pride stuff.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.691
I know what
the ASA is about.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.171
I'm not trying
to get killed for you.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.346
Then why bother to go?

14:30.957 --> 14:33.524
I don't have to
explain nothing to you.

14:33.568 --> 14:36.179
I will grant you the ASA
has been doing wrong.

14:36.223 --> 14:37.702
But that's why I'm here,

14:37.746 --> 14:39.661
to use my experience to help.

14:41.228 --> 14:44.709
Oh, so now you wanna help?

14:44.753 --> 14:46.886
Okay, so, how many kids
have you killed?

14:49.062 --> 14:50.411
Helped kill?

14:53.240 --> 14:54.110
Exactly.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.376
Come on, man!
Do something.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.421
I dare you.

15:01.596 --> 15:02.423
Really?

15:36.370 --> 15:37.632
Does Jen know
you're leaving?

15:38.285 --> 15:39.286
No.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.941
I'm not too good
with goodbyes.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.641
I think you owe her
more than that.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.382
Yeah.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.297
I do, too.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.303
Where are you gonna go?

15:56.868 --> 15:58.000
I don't know,

15:58.044 --> 15:59.393
but I gotta
get out of Freeland,

16:00.133 --> 16:01.308
for good this time.

16:02.483 --> 16:03.310
Why?

16:07.227 --> 16:08.402
Why would I stay?

16:16.323 --> 16:17.672
I wanna apologize to you.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.718
-You wanna apologize to me?
-Yeah.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.418
I feel like I didn't do
enough for you.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.855
Look, it's like I said
at the hospital
the night I died.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.510
You did what you could.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.165
So, apology not accepted.

16:37.692 --> 16:38.693
You won't be hunted.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.524
I had your name removed
from the ASA register.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.309
You'll have a chance at...

16:46.353 --> 16:49.878
somewhat of a normal life,
free from them.

16:52.054 --> 16:52.881
Thanks.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.016
That means a lot.

16:58.713 --> 17:01.629
But I'll never actually
be free and clear
from Painkiller.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.546
I can't even trust myself.

17:08.070 --> 17:10.420
What good would I be
to anybody?

17:10.464 --> 17:15.686
Well, you... You'd be
a lot of good to us
in Markovia.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.949
There is enough blood
on my hands, Mr. P.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.083
Look, Khalil. We can't...

17:22.389 --> 17:24.695
We can't undo
our past mistakes.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.349
All we can do is just...

17:26.393 --> 17:29.874
move forward
and try to do better.

17:29.918 --> 17:32.225
Look, I just want you to know
that you would be a big help.

17:33.487 --> 17:38.709
But I respect
your desire to...
To take off.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.929
If you ever find yourself
this way again,

17:41.799 --> 17:43.236
you'll find our door open.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.308
How many?

18:14.615 --> 18:15.616
I didn't hear you come in.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.748
I know.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.315
How many cures
have you created?

18:21.535 --> 18:24.451
Uh... Two, so far.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.453
That's all?

18:27.323 --> 18:29.151
Work faster.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.414
To work faster,
I'm gonna need your blood.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.546
My blood?

18:32.589 --> 18:34.591
I took a look
at your medical files.

18:34.635 --> 18:35.940
Your blood has a property

18:35.984 --> 18:37.551
that can supercharge
serum production.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.555
Why were you looking
at my medical files?

18:42.295 --> 18:43.296
You're a stable meta.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.002
All right.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.621
She's likely being
held in one of three labs.

19:04.665 --> 19:07.972
There's a notable concentration
of energy consumption in Lab A.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.149
That's probably
our best bet.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.976
Closest entrance is here.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.805
Recommended egress, here.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.024
Tough fight to get there.

19:17.678 --> 19:20.985
Let's just go out
the way we came in.

19:21.029 --> 19:24.032
That's generally considered
a no-no in special operations.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.035
So, they won't be
expecting it.

19:28.689 --> 19:29.646
Anything else?

19:29.690 --> 19:32.214
Yes. We also need
Tobias Whale.

19:32.258 --> 19:35.217
No. No, my mission
is to get my wife back,
that's it.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.306
The Markovians can...

19:37.350 --> 19:39.656
do whatever they want
with his evil albino ass.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.571
He's the only one
with the unique bone marrow

19:41.615 --> 19:43.182
needed for
the stabilization cure.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.661
If you leave him there,
we won't be able to

19:44.705 --> 19:47.186
stabilize our metas,
and they'll all die.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.492
If you're all right
with that, by all means,

19:49.536 --> 19:50.537
leave him there.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.120
What do you want now?

20:10.644 --> 20:12.385
I just wanted
to give you these.

20:13.734 --> 20:14.735
Enter.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.221
I snagged them from
one of the other rooms.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.222
I figured you could
use them.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.876
-Thanks.
-Right. No problem.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.357
The boots will enhance your
speed, and the vambraces--

20:28.401 --> 20:30.098
I know what vambraces do.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.231
Um...

20:33.580 --> 20:34.581
I appreciate it.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.288
Hey! What the hell?

20:47.420 --> 20:48.421
Get out!

20:49.596 --> 20:50.423
Now.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.124
Freakin' weirdo.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.086
Now the whole team is here.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.265
We can go.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.516
Whose idea was it
for Painkiller to come?

22:24.952 --> 22:25.996
Mine.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.824
Why? You know
we can't trust him.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.391
Don't worry about it.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.523
If he gets out of pocket,

22:31.567 --> 22:33.177
there's a way
to shut him down.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.702
Yeah, y'all sure
better hope so.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.541
I feel like I should
tell you something.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.281
What?

22:51.544 --> 22:53.372
Major Grey had
Erica chipped

22:53.415 --> 22:55.112
and programmed
with a kill order.

22:55.156 --> 22:56.549
I was given the same order.

22:57.898 --> 22:58.899
Kill me?

22:59.726 --> 23:01.380
Dr. Stewart.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.687
If she can't be saved,
Erica and I are to terminate.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.733
-I won't, but--
-But she will.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.389
I'm sorry, I would've
told you in the Pit,

23:10.432 --> 23:12.695
but Major Grey
would've known.

23:12.739 --> 23:15.742
Actually, you don't
have to worry about it.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.440
I kinda already deactivated
the chip in Erica.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.268
What?

23:22.096 --> 23:24.228
When you were
watching us on your phone.

23:24.272 --> 23:25.621
How did you know
I was watching you?

23:27.275 --> 23:28.363
Your phone told me.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.235
Remember when
I touched her hair?

23:31.279 --> 23:32.759
I do remember that.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.892
It was kind of creepy.
She thought so, too.

23:35.936 --> 23:39.592
But when I touched
her hair, I wasn't
trying to be romantic.

23:39.635 --> 23:42.421
I mean,
she's not really my type.
I love a woman who--

23:42.464 --> 23:43.422
Get on with it, son.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.687
Well, I'd seen the chip.

23:47.730 --> 23:50.472
I figured it was bad,
so I deactivated it.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.517
You're welcome.

23:53.301 --> 23:54.607
Gambi's teaching you well.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.436
Thank you.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.568
Now I got some business
to take care of.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.445
I know it was
a tough decision for you,

24:06.488 --> 24:08.011
but I'm glad
you decided to come.

24:09.839 --> 24:11.101
My mom,

24:11.145 --> 24:13.321
she always liked
and respected your mom.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.149
She'd want me to be here.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.458
Plus, I wanna be the guy
that saves people...

24:20.546 --> 24:22.504
not the one that kills them.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.597
Hey, you okay?

24:28.641 --> 24:30.512
Nobody's okay in here.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.819
The plane was one thing,
but this?

24:33.646 --> 24:35.299
People weren't meant to fly.

24:35.343 --> 24:37.476
If we were,
we'd be born with wings.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.132
-You've never flown before?

24:42.176 --> 24:44.613
Hey. Brandon,
what's going on?

24:44.657 --> 24:46.659
His powers are earth-based.

24:46.702 --> 24:49.139
Makes sense that his body
would rebel against air travel.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.489
All right,
everything's gonna be fine.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.881
You just need to
calm down, okay?

24:54.014 --> 24:54.841
Brandon.

24:58.584 --> 24:59.846
Khalil, did you just
poison him?

25:01.021 --> 25:03.023
I can't poison.
Only Painkiller can.

25:03.719 --> 25:05.025
That was Kyushu Jitsu.

26:01.429 --> 26:02.430
Talk to me.

26:08.915 --> 26:10.873
I should be the one
to go after Lynn.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.919
Under any other circumstances,
I would agree.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.705
But they can find
another Lynn.

26:16.749 --> 26:19.229
They can't find
another Tobias Whale.

26:19.273 --> 26:22.058
Besides, as strong
as the girls are,

26:22.102 --> 26:24.583
tactically, they're
still inexperienced.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.063
Tobias is far too dangerous
for them to handle
by themselves.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.587
I just want to
get there already,

26:28.630 --> 26:30.589
know that she's safe,
and bring her home.

26:35.637 --> 26:36.986
I'm proud of you,
you know that?

26:41.338 --> 26:43.123
I haven't done anything
for you to be proud of.

26:43.776 --> 26:44.777
But you have.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.128
Over, and over,
and over again,

26:48.171 --> 26:50.130
ever since
you were 12 years old.

26:50.173 --> 26:52.088
And now you're
not only a hero,

26:52.132 --> 26:53.960
you have the stature
to lead other heroes.

26:57.311 --> 26:59.095
I am proud of you,

26:59.139 --> 27:00.575
and Alvin would be, too.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.492
What is a hero these days?

27:07.974 --> 27:08.975
You are.

27:15.372 --> 27:16.635
Thanks, old man.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.903
We're landing in 30.

27:23.946 --> 27:26.383
We'll be blacked out
from Markovian air defense
for the next two hours.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.657
If this doesn't work,
they'll kill me.

27:42.182 --> 27:43.357
It's working already.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.055
Then, can I have some?

27:46.403 --> 27:47.404
No.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.234
Dr. Jace,
you're wanted in Lab B.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.817
TC and I will navigate you
through the compound,

28:08.861 --> 28:10.514
alert you to any threats.

28:10.558 --> 28:12.995
Let you know as soon as
we get eyes on Lynn.

28:13.039 --> 28:17.521
Okay. Grace, hold your position
as long as you can.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.784
Copy.

28:18.827 --> 28:21.003
I'll drop down
and take out the first wave.

28:21.047 --> 28:24.224
Thunder and Erica,
you're with me.
We're going after Tobias.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.705
Jennifer, Khalil,
Brandon, Grayle,

28:26.748 --> 28:28.532
you're going after Lynn.

28:28.576 --> 28:31.057
Stay focused, be ready.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.580
We're not going home
empty-handed.

28:33.799 --> 28:34.713
Let's do this.

29:31.508 --> 29:32.683
I'm in.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.124
About 30 meters,
then make a left.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.345
Wait, we got a door.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.479
It's not on my schematics.

29:54.314 --> 29:56.795
I just hit it with
100 million volts.
It didn't even heat up.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.100
My guess
is it's grounded

29:58.144 --> 29:59.928
to diffuse energy blasts
into the earth.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.538
It can ground this.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.936
I found Dr. Stewart.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.459
-Where?
-She's in Lab A.

30:09.503 --> 30:10.634
What about Dr. Jace?

30:10.678 --> 30:12.288
Jace, Jace... uh, Lab B.

30:12.332 --> 30:13.637
Okay, look...

30:13.681 --> 30:15.291
-Brandon, wait.
-I'm on it.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.467
Stay on mission. Come on.

30:17.511 --> 30:18.512
I'll take point.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.215
Stand down!

30:26.259 --> 30:27.347
Stand down!

30:44.538 --> 30:45.887
-Stop!
-What's going on?

30:45.931 --> 30:47.976
Sounds like the cavalry
is here.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.673
Quiet, squid.

30:49.717 --> 30:52.328
Whoever it is,
they will regret this.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.678
You, you, take it
to the bunker.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.724
- Yeah.

31:02.425 --> 31:03.513
Damn!

31:03.557 --> 31:04.558
Come on, same time.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.523
What are we gonna do?

31:13.567 --> 31:14.698
Can we find
another way around?

31:14.742 --> 31:15.569
Negative.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.879
Wait, Erica,
get ready to absorb.
Thunder, hit her.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.619
-Wait, what?
-Hit her!

31:30.410 --> 31:31.890
Yeah, again.
Hard as you can.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.068
More.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.112
Wait, wait, wait.
We're just wasting time.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.722
We're gonna get caught.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.550
Wait, no, I think I get it.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.204
Her power's organic
like photosynthesis.

31:42.248 --> 31:44.293
So, it'll follow
the Fibonacci sequence?

31:44.337 --> 31:46.556
Exactly.
Every blow Erica absorbs

31:46.600 --> 31:48.558
creates exponential growth
in her powers.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.038
Load her up.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.083
Tell us when
you've had enough.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.045
I can't hold anymore.

31:57.089 --> 31:58.960
Then don't.
Handle that door.

32:03.791 --> 32:04.923
Well, okay then.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.185
Whoo!

32:07.795 --> 32:09.231
They're moving Tobias.

32:09.275 --> 32:10.798
Probably to a more
secure location.

32:10.841 --> 32:12.191
We can't let them
get there.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.410
And you got Markovians
coming your way.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.282
-Go. We got this.

32:17.674 --> 32:18.675
Go.

32:23.811 --> 32:24.943
-Move!

32:31.819 --> 32:34.256
Dr. Stewart,
we are moving you.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.693
Take what you need
to keep working, and...

32:37.999 --> 32:38.957
be quick about it.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.134
Get rid of your detail.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.833
No! I didn't mean...

32:45.876 --> 32:46.965
Stand still.

33:11.163 --> 33:12.860
Now, you're gonna
lead me out of here.

33:23.871 --> 33:26.656
You're almost there.
Twenty meters away, but...

33:26.700 --> 33:29.007
But we have company.
I feel them.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.008
"Feel them"?

33:31.183 --> 33:32.010
Excuse me.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.239
There's more
closing in from behind.

33:44.283 --> 33:46.676
He's right. Now,
Dr. Stewart is on the move.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.070
Hey, go.
I'll hold them off.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.855
-You'll be all right?
-Why wouldn't I be?

33:51.899 --> 33:53.205
Never mind. Just take care.

34:00.734 --> 34:01.909
Stand down, son.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.651
Yeah, I'm not your son.

34:07.784 --> 34:10.874
By the way you're standing,
your respiration...

34:10.918 --> 34:11.919
you're not all there.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.531
Bionics, lots of them.

34:15.575 --> 34:18.230
Not enough nervous system
for me to push.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.407
Not enough sense to run.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.237
Clearly, you're what
they call a "millennial."

34:27.500 --> 34:28.675
You talk too much.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.264
Not bad.

34:52.307 --> 34:53.439
You don't wanna do this.

34:55.702 --> 34:56.703
Like I said...

34:57.791 --> 34:58.966
you talk too much.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.101
Heads up.
The security detail

35:03.144 --> 35:04.798
moving Tobias
is around the next corner.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.682
We gotta go.

35:19.726 --> 35:21.249
You stand a better chance
of getting out of here
if I'm not carrying your ass.

35:21.293 --> 35:22.468
This way.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.122
It's actually nice
to see you, Jefferson.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.128
Even if that was my name...

35:30.171 --> 35:32.130
we're not on
a first-name basis, bruh.

35:32.173 --> 35:33.957
Negro, stop lying.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.611
You don't want
your cover blown,

35:35.655 --> 35:37.961
don't keep coming
out the woodwork
to save the Pierce girls.

35:38.005 --> 35:41.269
And now you've come
all this way to save that
fine-ass ex-wife of yours.

35:41.313 --> 35:42.618
I get it.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.838
I've had a lot of quality time
with her myself.

35:46.492 --> 35:48.798
What, she didn't tell you?

35:48.842 --> 35:50.800
Well, it actually is,
"ex-wife."

35:50.844 --> 35:52.628
She's quite charming...

35:52.672 --> 35:54.326
for being a dope fiend.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.374
Maybe, I should just
barbecue your ass.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.725
-Come on now, Jeff.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.814
You could've just
blasted those soldiers.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.555
Look, you and I
both know your black ass

36:06.599 --> 36:09.036
used hand-to-hand combat
to avoid hitting me.

36:18.524 --> 36:19.916
Is your name Jace?

36:19.960 --> 36:21.527
It is.
What can I do for you?

36:22.702 --> 36:24.704
You can die, bitch.

36:28.882 --> 36:29.796
Stop!

36:32.059 --> 36:33.234
Brandon, stop!

36:37.369 --> 36:38.370
Stop!

36:47.248 --> 36:48.902
Who the hell was that?

36:50.991 --> 36:51.818
Keep up.

37:16.321 --> 37:17.887
I'm impressed.

37:17.931 --> 37:21.369
You're fast, strong,
well taught.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.545
But experience
is the best teacher.

37:23.589 --> 37:26.548
Look, I got your
measure, kid.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.028
Stay down
if you wanna live.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.310
Heard a lot about you,
Black Lightning.

38:33.659 --> 38:34.921
Hate we had to
meet like this.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.980
-Mom.
-Jen! No, no, no.

38:51.024 --> 38:52.199
Stand still.

38:55.376 --> 38:56.638
Is he with you?

38:56.682 --> 38:58.379
Not at all.

38:58.423 --> 38:59.685
-We need to go.
-No, no. Wait, wait.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.166
Shock yourself,

39:03.210 --> 39:04.951
and don't stop
until you pass out.

39:13.699 --> 39:15.831
Oh, harsh.
You have powers now?

39:15.875 --> 39:17.833
For another 20 minutes.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.008
Which way?

39:19.052 --> 39:20.227
Come on,
there's a chopper waiting.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.016
Your sister
has your mother.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.496
-What about Grace?
-Erica got to her.

39:28.540 --> 39:29.976
She's on the chopper.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.369
Get out of there, Anissa.
We have to go.

39:31.412 --> 39:32.370
All right.
I'm on my way.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.212
Where's Black Lightning
and Thunder?

39:49.256 --> 39:50.475
She's on her way.

39:50.518 --> 39:52.128
Black Lightning's not
answering his comms.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.391
All right.
I'm going after him.

39:53.434 --> 39:54.740
Hold on!

39:54.783 --> 39:56.698
You can't chase your tail
in an op like this,

39:56.742 --> 39:58.221
otherwise,
nobody goes home.

39:58.265 --> 39:59.658
Hey, what's going on?

39:59.701 --> 40:01.399
Dad's missing, and this fool
wants me to stay put.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.052
He's right.
Just give him a minute.

40:03.096 --> 40:04.576
Everybody, stand still.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.233
Walk away.

40:10.277 --> 40:11.931
That doesn't
work on me, Dr. Stewart.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.760
Look, I'm not a murderer.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.415
If you come with me,

40:17.458 --> 40:19.765
everybody gets to go back
where they came from.

40:20.461 --> 40:21.375
You don't,

40:22.463 --> 40:23.638
everybody dies.

40:26.119 --> 40:27.512
No, Khalil.
It's too late.

40:29.992 --> 40:30.993
I'll go.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.307
Close the door
and take off.

40:53.146 --> 40:55.975
Brother, you are everything
they said you were!

40:58.020 --> 40:59.021
But so am I.

41:04.244 --> 41:06.464
Nobody touches my wife!

41:22.871 --> 41:24.003
I love you!

41:29.530 --> 41:30.444
I love you.

41:31.184 --> 41:32.185
Let's go home.
