<i>But how can we create the thing the</i>
<i>audience sees that wasn't actually there?</i>

01:03.688 --> 01:07.734
As audiences get smarter, wiser,
sort of see through the illusion,

01:09.819 --> 01:11.738
<i>that bar just raises.</i>

01:11.821 --> 01:14.657

How do we make this look great?

03:41.971 --> 03:45.850
Well, the history of ILM goes way back.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.187
And when we started the first film,

03:49.270 --> 03:54.651
I investigated all of the optical houses
and special effects people,

03:55.318 --> 04:00.156
and realized there was nobody around and
no company around that could really do

04:00.240 --> 04:02.951
the things that I wanted
to do on that picture.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.954
So, I realized that I was gonna
have to start a company

04:06.704 --> 04:08.748
and put together a whole group of people

04:08.831 --> 04:12.043
that would just be specifically
for making <i>Star Wars.</i>

NARRATOR: <i>May the force be with you</i>
<i>in</i> Star Wars.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.700
GEORGE: <i>When I was writing</i> Star Wars,

04:45.118 --> 04:46.786
<i>I spent two years</i>

04:46.869 --> 04:49.622
<i>trying to find the story,</i>
<i>trying to find the script.</i>

04:52.542 --> 04:57.547
I thought spaceships, dogfights in space,
that's a great idea.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.098
I said, I want to do that.
Only I want to do it like a space opera.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.976
<i>Like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon.</i>

05:10.351 --> 05:12.979
<i>But it will really have movement,</i>
<i>it will be kinetic.</i>

05:13.396 --> 05:15.690
I'm an energetic filmmaker.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.738
I like speed.

05:27.535 --> 05:31.331
At the time, the last real science
fiction film was <i>2001.</i>

05:33.791 --> 05:37.211
<i>Which is brilliant, and the way</i>
<i>it was made was brilliant.</i>

05:38.004 --> 05:42.342
But the shots were all long takes
and very slow.

05:43.217 --> 05:47.013
<i>So I looked around for special effects</i>
<i>houses, visual effects houses,</i>

05:47.138 --> 05:50.099
<i>and nobody could do</i>
<i>what I wanted to do for</i> Star Wars.

05:50.683 --> 05:54.228
So the big question was,
"How are we going to do the effects?"

05:58.107 --> 05:59.859
<i>I met John Dykstra.</i>

06:01.069 --> 06:05.198
<i>He was working with visual effects,</i>
<i>mostly on commercials.</i>

06:06.616 --> 06:13.247
And I realized that there was a little
cabal of secret special effects people.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.168
<i>Some of them worked in commercials,</i>

06:17.251 --> 06:21.464
<i>some of them were just wishing,</i>
<i>some of them were making home movies,</i>

06:22.840 --> 06:24.384
<i>but they all knew each other.</i>

06:25.968 --> 06:28.930
So and so can do that,
and I know somebody can do this.

06:29.013 --> 06:32.850
<i>And it really was this</i>
<i>kind of gang of outsiders.</i>

06:35.603 --> 06:38.815
<i>And so through John Dykstra</i>
<i>we tapped into that world.</i>

06:40.525 --> 06:42.110
ANCHORWOMAN: <i>Good morning, America.</i>

06:42.193 --> 06:45.863
In the world of film and television,
even our fantasies have been modernized.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.450
Instead of wizards and magicians,
the people who make our dreams come true

06:49.534 --> 06:51.619
are now called special effects designers.

06:52.203 --> 06:56.207
<i>These new wizards use computers,</i>
<i>calculators, and special cameras.</i>

06:56.707 --> 07:00.545
<i>With these tools and a generous supply</i>
<i>of good, old-fashioned imagination,</i>

07:00.920 --> 07:04.757
<i>John Dykstra created the fantastic</i>
<i>effects scenes for</i> Star Wars.

07:05.842 --> 07:10.012
John. No one says "One day I'm going to be
a special effects designer."

07:10.721 --> 07:11.973
What led up to this?

07:12.056 --> 07:13.724
Oh, a lot of fooling around.

07:27.196 --> 07:31.033
JOHN: <i>I am definitely involved with</i>
<i>machines. I like machines a lot.</i>

07:32.034 --> 07:34.579
<i>I always played with cars</i>
<i>and things like that.</i>

07:34.662 --> 07:35.705
<i>I like physics.</i>

07:36.456 --> 07:37.665
<i>Always liked photography.</i>

07:37.748 --> 07:40.209
<i>So it was sort of a situation</i>
<i>where I just brought</i>

07:40.293 --> 07:42.753
<i>all of my favorite things together,</i>
<i>all of my hobbies,</i>

07:42.837 --> 07:44.505
<i>and made one big hobby out of it.</i>

07:45.173 --> 07:49.093
Explain to me how you take a scene
from your mind to the screen.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.431
I'm basically a lucky guy.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.515
(LAUGHS)

07:56.058 --> 07:59.395
When I signed up for college,
I didn't have a major.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.231
I just was going to school
because they had accepted me.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.403
<i>The counselor who I was assigned</i>
<i>based on my last name</i>

08:07.487 --> 08:10.656
turned out to be the head
of the industrial design department.

08:11.532 --> 08:15.328
So I went to school
in industrial design, truly a fluke.

08:16.454 --> 08:20.249
<i>From school I had a friend</i>
<i>who was working with Doug Trumbull,</i>

08:20.750 --> 08:25.129
<i>who had done visual effects</i>
<i>for</i> 2001: A Space Odyssey.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.133
<i>And Doug was looking for model makers</i>

08:29.217 --> 08:31.052
and people who could do design work.

08:31.135 --> 08:36.682
So I segued from school
to going to work at Trumbull Film Effects.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.393
<i>I started on</i> Silent Running.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.147
<i>I drew designs for the ships,</i>

08:43.231 --> 08:45.441
<i>then built the models for the ships</i>

08:45.525 --> 08:48.110
<i>and then photographed</i>
<i>the models for the ships.</i>

08:48.819 --> 08:52.198
<i>It was an intense, immersive education.</i>

08:53.908 --> 08:55.117
<i>Coming to work was fun.</i>

08:56.911 --> 09:02.667
Then I was approached by Gary Kurtz,
who was a producer for George Lucas,

09:03.417 --> 09:07.004
<i>and he wanted to talk about</i>
<i>the visual effects for a movie.</i>

09:14.428 --> 09:16.556
<i>I was given the script,</i>

09:16.639 --> 09:20.393
and I go, "How bad can this be?
It's a dogfight in space, right?"

09:22.186 --> 09:23.980
<i>So I came to their offices,</i>

09:24.689 --> 09:29.610
did a lot of hand flying,
did a lot of talking about moving camera

09:29.902 --> 09:34.490
<i>because I'm a pilot and I love speed</i>
<i>and I've been strapping cameras</i>

09:34.574 --> 09:37.535
<i>onto airplanes and stuff</i>
<i>like that for a long time.</i>

09:38.327 --> 09:40.913
So it was like all these things
fell into place.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.166
<i>George had the vision.</i>

09:45.042 --> 09:49.297
<i>George knew what the images had to convey.</i>

09:52.049 --> 09:53.801
And I understood the movie.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.886
(AIRPLANE DRONING)

10:02.143 --> 10:06.314
<i>But at the time George was involved</i>
<i>with all of the pre-production work</i>

10:06.397 --> 10:09.984
he was doing for the photography
they were going to do in Britain.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.445
GEORGE: <i>I was going back and forth</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

10:12.528 --> 10:17.950
We had one foot in the door with John,
and he said he needed

10:18.034 --> 10:20.578
<i>to build the equipment</i>
<i>in order to get the shots.</i>

10:20.661 --> 10:24.749
So they basically said,
"Okay, you go do this."

10:27.043 --> 10:31.589
<i>I went and found an empty warehouse</i>
<i>in Van Nuys, near the Van Nuys Airport.</i>

10:33.507 --> 10:35.217
<i>And I walked into the place,</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:37.887
they installed the phone,
didn't even have furniture.

10:37.970 --> 10:41.557
I sat on the carpet on the floor
in the office that I was going to use,

10:41.641 --> 10:46.687
and I started calling people that I wanted
to bring in to work on the project.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.360
RICHARD: <i>One day I got this call</i>
<i>from John,</i>

10:52.943 --> 10:57.948
"Richard, I'd like to talk to you

10:58.032 --> 11:01.118
"of this sci-fi movie

11:02.620 --> 11:04.288
I said, "I'll be right there."

11:04.372 --> 11:05.414
(CHUCKLES)

11:05.498 --> 11:10.711

11:10.920 --> 11:13.047
<i>from Cal State Long Beach,</i>

11:13.130 --> 11:16.133
<i>where Dykstra had graduated</i>
<i>a couple years before.</i>

11:17.677 --> 11:21.013
I didn't graduate because
I got a job in Malibu,

11:22.640 --> 11:24.308
<i>and the commute was killing me.</i>

11:24.600 --> 11:26.727
<i>I went back to school on a Saturday.</i>

11:27.395 --> 11:32.024
<i>And I see this flyer taped to the door</i>
<i>of the industrial design department,</i>

11:32.149 --> 11:37.113
and it said, "We are looking for
artists, model builders,

11:37.238 --> 11:40.616
"painters, draftsmen for a..."

11:40.783 --> 11:42.952
I think they said it was a space movie.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.747
And there was a phone number
and address there, so...

11:46.831 --> 11:48.332
I got out the Thomas Guide,

11:48.416 --> 11:52.128
<i>which at the time was the only way</i>
<i>you could find your way around LA.</i>

11:55.423 --> 12:00.636
I took my ruler and I figured out
I could save an hour off my commute.

12:02.012 --> 12:06.142
So I jumped in my Volkswagen,
zipped out to Belgian Avenue

12:06.225 --> 12:08.144
<i>and met with John and Gary Kurtz.</i>

12:09.520 --> 12:12.940
<i>John had this big desk.</i>
<i>It was like the size of a pool table,</i>

12:13.649 --> 12:14.942
and we were sitting across.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.069
Both had beards, you know,

12:17.528 --> 12:20.322
and Gary Kurtz had his Quaker beard,
you know.

12:22.491 --> 12:26.912
The original job offer was for
six weeks doing storyboards.

12:28.831 --> 12:32.752
<i>John asked me if I could do storyboards,</i>
<i>and I said, "Yeah, of course I can."</i>

12:32.835 --> 12:34.962
I had no idea what a storyboard was.

12:35.921 --> 12:39.717
I came across a guy who I went
to college with and lived in Seal Beach

12:39.925 --> 12:43.304
and he said, "Oh, Lorne,
you'd be perfect for the job.

12:43.387 --> 12:46.766
<i>"We're working on this science fiction</i>

<i>"and we need model makers."</i>

12:49.143 --> 12:50.978
<i>We all came from different schools,</i>

12:51.061 --> 12:53.147
and a lot of people
were friends of friends.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.859
This guy that I was working with
was was older, and he said,

12:56.942 --> 12:59.278
"Well, I got a buddy that
I was in the Navy with,

12:59.361 --> 13:01.572
"who's doing some kind
of a science fiction show,

13:01.655 --> 13:03.240
<i>"and I know you're interested in that.</i>

13:03.365 --> 13:06.076
"He's looking for people.
So here's his number.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.204
"Give him a call.
His name is Richard Edlund."

13:08.287 --> 13:11.207
And it turns out he's looking
for camera people,

13:11.290 --> 13:15.294
which I'm not,
and so I gave them Dennis' number.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.466
DENNIS: <i>Until</i> Star Wars <i>came along,</i>

13:20.758 --> 13:24.178
I've never felt that there was going to be
any place for me in the business

13:24.261 --> 13:27.348
or there was any way
to make any money doing visual effects.

13:30.601 --> 13:34.021
<i>But it was maybe the only</i>
<i>thing I was interested in.</i>

13:35.439 --> 13:36.565

<i>And I had a group of friends my own age,</i>

13:41.111 --> 13:42.988
that were also effects fans.

13:46.367 --> 13:52.373
I've always wondered why I locked
into wanting to do this so early.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.879
I was watching movies like <i>King Kong.</i>

13:59.880 --> 14:05.761
The films of my hero, Ray Harryhausen,
and something just clicked.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
(ROARING)

14:09.056 --> 14:13.018
When I was about five years old,
<i>King Kong</i> came on television,

14:31.495 --> 14:33.581
like eight times the first week
it came out.

14:33.664 --> 14:36.458
The <i>7th Voyage of Sinbad</i>
just melted my brain.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.210
That kind of sealed the deal.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.920

(MAN SCREAMING)

15:03.986 --> 15:06.447
DENNIS: <i>I asked my mom,</i>
<i>"Do you know how this is done?"</i>

15:07.114 --> 15:11.327
<i>She said, "Yeah, it's just a lot</i>
<i>of separate pictures of a model,</i>

15:11.702 --> 15:14.955
<i>"and they're moved a little bit</i>
<i>between each frame of film."</i>

15:15.998 --> 15:18.167
I have no idea how my mother knew that.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.586
I didn't even know
movies were frames of film.

15:21.837 --> 15:25.257
<i>But from a very young age</i>
<i>I was attracted to visuals.</i>

15:26.050 --> 15:28.677
This spectacle that
I couldn't see in real life.

15:29.887 --> 15:34.934
It was compelling to be able to see
some sort of giant creature of some sort

15:35.017 --> 15:37.978
that I couldn't walk
out of the theater and see

15:38.062 --> 15:41.023
and I just wanted to,
I wanted to see those things for real.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.527
<i>In those days, you couldn't repeat</i>
<i>a movie over and over again.</i>

15:45.611 --> 15:48.322
<i>There were no DVDs</i>
<i>or streaming or anything for them.</i>

15:48.989 --> 15:51.241
<i>So I just wanted to recreate in my mind,</i>

15:51.367 --> 15:54.036
<i>these memories</i>
<i>of what I see in the theater,</i>

15:54.119 --> 15:56.997
<i>and there was no way to</i>
<i>unless you did it yourself.</i>

15:57.081 --> 16:02.836
I was actually making home movies
when I was in the 6th grade...

16:06.090 --> 16:09.051
<i>with this Kodak movie camera.</i>

16:10.970 --> 16:14.306
<i>I think we actually bought it</i>
<i>with Blue Chip Stamps.</i>

16:14.390 --> 16:16.058
(LAUGHS)

16:19.687 --> 16:22.272
KEN: <i>It was how it started,</i>
<i>how to invent stuff</i>

16:22.356 --> 16:25.985
<i>without knowing a damn thing</i>
<i>about what you're doing, but feeling it.</i>

16:26.402 --> 16:29.113
<i>And I guess I absorbed it</i>
<i>from seeing so many movies.</i>

16:32.366 --> 16:35.744
Watching movies really precipitated
the interest in prehistoric life

16:35.828 --> 16:39.331
and dinosaurs and kind of became
an amateur paleontologist.

16:42.793 --> 16:47.089
I didn't have any kind of a social life,
I just spent all my time alone

16:47.172 --> 16:49.216
drawing and painting and sculpting.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.053
<i>For Christmas, my parents would buy me</i>

16:53.137 --> 16:58.308
<i>these playsets that had a bunch of</i>
<i>army men or dinosaurs and whatnot.</i>

16:58.392 --> 17:00.644
<i>And so, you would create these scenarios</i>

17:00.728 --> 17:03.397
(LAUGHING) <i>with World War II characters</i>
<i>and dinosaurs.</i>

17:03.856 --> 17:08.485
<i>You know? And that was that was a big part</i>
<i>of exercising the imagination.</i>

17:09.403 --> 17:12.322
<i>I would mow lawns and get an 8mm camera</i>

17:12.406 --> 17:15.701
<i>and set up in my bedroom</i>
<i>and push clay around.</i>

17:18.454 --> 17:21.915
<i>When G.I. Joes came out,</i>
<i>I would steal them from Sears</i>

17:21.999 --> 17:23.709
<i>because I didn't have enough money.</i>

17:23.792 --> 17:26.170
(LAUGHS) <i>You know,</i>
<i>I could like fashion them.</i>

17:27.838 --> 17:30.841
<i>You know, all the gears started to turn.</i>

17:33.218 --> 17:36.847
And we tried so many hard things
that we should never have attempted,

17:36.930 --> 17:38.140
<i>but we pulled off some of it.</i>

17:39.975 --> 17:43.270
<i>And you'd go, you'd put it</i>
<i>into the drugstore to be developed.</i>

17:43.395 --> 17:44.980
<i>You'd wait. You get it back.</i>

17:45.105 --> 17:46.523
<i>You put it on the projector.</i>

17:47.274 --> 17:49.860
<i>And if it worked</i>
<i>or even came close to working,</i>

17:49.943 --> 17:53.405
<i>that feeling of excitement,</i>
<i>it's hard to describe.</i>

17:55.949 --> 17:59.536
The goal was to please myself.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.585
And there were a few of us
that got to know each other

18:06.877 --> 18:10.714
<i>through this magazine,</i>
Famous Monsters of Filmland.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.969
It was a Christmastime down in San Diego,

18:16.053 --> 18:19.056
where they used to have newsstands,
and there it was.

18:20.099 --> 18:25.062
I had no idea where the magazine came from
that day or what it was.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.189
But there were photos from effects film.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.859
<i>So I could look at the photo</i>

18:30.943 --> 18:33.487
<i>and start to understand</i>
<i>how it was being done.</i>

18:35.322 --> 18:37.825
KEN: <i>Forrest J. Ackerman was the editor,</i>

18:37.908 --> 18:42.538
and I think Forry really influenced
an awful lot of people doing this work.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.582
PHIL: <i>Forry was very strange,</i>

18:45.666 --> 18:49.586
kind of a quizzical Vincent Price.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.380
(CHUCKLING) And he did stuff like,

18:51.463 --> 18:53.966
if you'd knock on the door
to his Ackermansion,

18:54.049 --> 18:58.053
he called it, and the door would creep
open and his hand would come out,

18:58.512 --> 19:03.517
and on his hand was Bela Lugosi's
Dracula ring from the movie.

19:03.642 --> 19:09.398
Good evening, I am Doctor Ackcula
and I bid you welcome.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.610
Follow me if you dare.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.739
That looked like a regular house on the
outside, and you walk inside and

19:17.823 --> 19:21.869
all there were, were books and photos
and props and paintings.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.996
I was flabbergasted.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.332
There's actual models
from the original Kong.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.336
You know, and you learn more
about how movies are made.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.923
I still remember when I first went
to Forry's place,

19:35.007 --> 19:38.177
there's a group of people there,
and we met Jon Berg.

19:39.136 --> 19:45.017
<i>And Jon invited us to go to Cascade</i>

19:49.188 --> 19:51.315
<i>And here's Phil Kellison, the director.</i>

19:51.607 --> 19:54.902
Phil Kellison was the head of the

19:54.985 --> 19:57.613
He moved up the street I lived on,

19:57.696 --> 20:01.742

He said, "You want to do some animation?"
and I said, "Why, sure."

<i>and walked by itself.</i>

20:44.910 --> 20:45.953

And so many great people worked there.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.542

20:53.835 --> 20:55.128
<i>and Dennis Muren.</i>

20:56.380 --> 20:58.006
It was kind of an amazing group.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.760
DENNIS: <i>Cascade closed up</i>

21:02.469 --> 21:05.973
because suddenly visual effects
weren't fashionable anymore.

21:06.473 --> 21:10.018
<i>There were some effects departments</i>
<i>still in the big studios,</i>

21:10.102 --> 21:11.395

21:11.812 --> 21:14.064
<i>So it was all going</i>
<i>to kind of come to an end.</i>

21:15.857 --> 21:18.277
<i>I realized I would have to grow up</i>

21:19.236 --> 21:20.737
<i>and get a real job.</i>

21:22.489 --> 21:25.617
But then eventually I started hearing

(CAR ENGINE REVVING)

21:38.797 --> 21:44.219
When I read the script for <i>Star Wars,</i>
I just thought, "This is impossible."

21:47.222 --> 21:50.392
Honestly, I was worried
about the script at first

21:50.475 --> 21:52.227
<i>because, I mean, it was like,</i>

21:53.603 --> 21:56.481
<i>it was like a teenage script in a sense,</i>

<i>"trust in the force" lines</i>
<i>and those kind of things, you know?</i>

I mean, who was going to do this,

22:03.947 --> 22:05.866
And so I was worried about that.

22:06.366 --> 22:09.244

22:09.911 --> 22:11.455

I don't even know how to do
a lot of the shots.

22:18.587 --> 22:21.214
I have to say I was a little bit confused.

22:22.758 --> 22:26.011
<i>There was a lot of stuff</i>
<i>that didn't make perfect sense to me,</i>

22:26.470 --> 22:28.930
but then again, I wasn't
a movie person, you know?

22:29.097 --> 22:31.850
In fact, it was probably
the first script I'd ever read.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.312
KEN: <i>I remember I was in...</i>

22:35.395 --> 22:37.689
I want to say it was
in Jon Berg's car with Dennis

22:37.773 --> 22:42.027
and we had the script and it was like,
"Wow, this has a lot of cool stuff in it."

22:43.236 --> 22:46.239
And it was like a lot of movies
we wanted to make personally,

22:46.323 --> 22:48.533

studio wanted to make.

<i>who could do a lot of different things.</i>

-No, it's long.
-No, we want it over normal height.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.556
And most of the people
were not movie people.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.810
<i>They were from all</i>
<i>different walks of life.</i>

23:15.936 --> 23:19.064
KEN: <i>The group on the first</i> Star Wars
<i>some of it was very green.</i>

23:19.147 --> 23:22.859
They were basically machinists,
guys who worked on motorcycles.

23:23.527 --> 23:27.906
<i>But John was there to guide them</i>
<i>into what was necessary, what to build,</i>

23:28.115 --> 23:31.785

what was necessary for the movie.

23:36.415 --> 23:41.837

<i>in different things</i>

23:41.920 --> 23:44.131
<i>that they couldn't get paid for.</i>

23:45.424 --> 23:47.384
And I brought those people together.

But to be honest with you,
this was a long shot.

23:56.601 --> 24:00.605
<i>We were departing from convention</i>
<i>in several different ways,</i>

24:01.148 --> 24:05.819

it could have been a disaster.

RICHARD: <i>It was the opportunity</i>
<i>to really go for it.</i>

24:11.575 --> 24:13.952
You know, it's like

24:14.035 --> 24:17.998
you're standing on the top of the jump
and you know that you can do it,

24:18.081 --> 24:20.459
and everybody had that attitude.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.837
<i>But we had to school each other.</i>

24:27.007 --> 24:29.759
JOE: <i>George wasn't there</i>
<i>an awful lot in the beginning,</i>

24:29.885 --> 24:33.388

24:52.699 --> 24:53.783
Yeah. Cut it. Yeah, yeah.

24:53.867 --> 24:57.537

JOHN: <i>I mean, who knows what</i>
<i>was going on in England.</i>

25:22.145 --> 25:26.066
But George had left us his material

25:26.191 --> 25:31.947

and, you know, gun camera stuff,

25:32.030 --> 25:36.034

25:36.952 --> 25:38.620
(EXPLOSION)

25:39.704 --> 25:43.708
So we used that as a template
for what we needed to build.

25:44.459 --> 25:47.003
<i>I approach it from the point of view</i>
<i>of what would I get</i>

25:47.087 --> 25:50.382
<i>if I bolted a camera onto this ship</i>
<i>and went to space and did it?</i>

25:51.383 --> 25:55.554
<i>I wanted to make this stuff</i>
<i>indistinguishable from reality.</i>

25:57.597 --> 25:59.766
<i>And that required motion control.</i>

26:00.725 --> 26:07.399
Motion control is the ability
to record the movement of the camera

26:07.816 --> 26:10.777
<i>through space,</i>
<i>forward and backward, side to side,</i>

26:10.902 --> 26:13.071
<i>rotation up and down.</i>

26:13.530 --> 26:15.782
<i>It makes a record of that movement,</i>

26:16.116 --> 26:19.160
<i>and then you can repeat that move</i>
<i>as many times as necessary.</i>

26:20.495 --> 26:24.583
<i>I had worked with a prototype</i>
<i>motion control system years before.</i>

26:25.375 --> 26:31.172
<i>I had been at the University of Berkeley</i>
<i>on a project about perception.</i>

26:32.924 --> 26:36.886
<i>The idea was to build a miniature</i>
<i>of a portion of Marin County</i>

26:36.970 --> 26:39.139
<i>and photograph it with a camera</i>

26:39.639 --> 26:44.227
<i>and then compare responses from people</i>
<i>who viewed that film of the miniature</i>

26:44.519 --> 26:48.773
<i>with people who were put in a car</i>
<i>and driven through the same environment.</i>

26:51.568 --> 26:54.738
<i>At Berkeley, I met Al Miller</i>
<i>and Jerry Jeffress,</i>

26:55.655 --> 26:58.617
<i>and they had built a very early</i>
<i>motion control system</i>

26:58.950 --> 27:03.079
<i>to move the camera around the miniature</i>
<i>and to be able to repeat the moves.</i>

27:04.706 --> 27:09.002
I got together with them and we conceived
the motion control systems for <i>Star Wars,</i>

27:10.003 --> 27:13.965
<i>because most of the images</i>
<i>were built up of multiple elements.</i>

27:14.341 --> 27:16.343
<i>We'd do matts on one pass.</i>

27:16.426 --> 27:21.097
<i>We'd do engines on another pass</i>
<i>and the camera had to be able</i>

27:21.181 --> 27:23.767
<i>to duplicate the move exactly, precisely.</i>

27:24.142 --> 27:26.269
So that when we put
those elements together

27:26.353 --> 27:28.521
<i>in the sandwich we call optical printing,</i>

27:29.022 --> 27:31.483

<i>a perfect proving ground for the idea,</i>

<i>but we needed to build new equipment.</i>

Now, you've got to understand
I had to be nuts

27:47.165 --> 27:50.585

"and then I'm going to make

But they did.

<i>"so I'm going to put the cockpit</i>

so I put the cockpit
over on the right side.

39:55.184 --> 39:58.396

39:58.479 --> 40:01.941

41:04.086 --> 41:05.713

41:05.796 --> 41:09.008
<i>So even if you looked at it close,</i>
<i>if there was a box,</i>

41:09.133 --> 41:11.635
<i>it had to have tubes</i>
<i>that went to a planum box</i>

41:11.719 --> 41:14.805
<i>that then went to something else</i>
<i>and had electrical wires</i>

41:14.889 --> 41:16.891
<i>that then connected into something else.</i>

41:17.099 --> 41:19.560
<i>It had to have some kind of</i>
<i>mechanical connection.</i>

41:20.769 --> 41:24.064
We adopted the phrase
"boilerplate technology."

41:24.231 --> 41:28.569
The model builders were working
off sketches for a lot of it.

41:28.819 --> 41:31.947
<i>But for some of the minute detail,</i>
<i>they were just finding parts</i>

41:32.031 --> 41:36.035
<i>from model kits that looked like, "This</i>
<i>is a mechanical thing, this'll look good."</i>

41:36.118 --> 41:37.495
LORNE: <i>We called this kit bashing.</i>

41:37.828 --> 41:41.373
<i>And we would buy German tanks,</i>
<i>airplanes, guns,</i>

41:41.540 --> 41:45.294

an incredible amount of good parts.

41:45.377 --> 41:48.631
JOE: <i>We were limited somewhat</i>
<i>by the model kits that we could get,</i>

41:48.714 --> 41:53.636
because if we had to build 10 X-wings,
we had to find 10 of those kits.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.680
<i>So we'd buy these kits by the pound.</i>

41:58.682 --> 42:00.768
LORNE: <i>I was working on the Sandcrawler,</i>

42:01.977 --> 42:05.606

There's about 280 treads.

LORNE: <i>George was still in England,</i>
<i>but we weren't producing film yet.</i>

43:29.231 --> 43:31.734
Designing and building
everything from scratch

43:31.817 --> 43:36.655
<i>was much harder and more time-consuming</i>
<i>than could have been anticipated.</i>

43:37.698 --> 43:40.576
<i>Jon Erland and I</i>

43:40.659 --> 43:46.123

<i>that we knew were incredibly valuable.</i>

43:46.832 --> 43:49.835
I noticed that the way that
they were making the spaceships

43:49.918 --> 43:51.420
<i>is that they would find a part</i>

43:51.503 --> 43:54.465
<i>and then they would mix five-minute epoxy,</i>
<i>put it on the back side,</i>

43:54.548 --> 43:57.217
<i>and then they'd put masking tape</i>
<i>and hold it in place.</i>

43:57.343 --> 43:58.969
<i>And then they'd go to the next part</i>

43:59.053 --> 44:01.764
and, you know, masking tape
and five-minute epoxy.

44:01.847 --> 44:04.725

44:05.100 --> 44:06.644

<i>could buy things industrially</i>

44:10.064 --> 44:12.066
<i>that regular human beings couldn't get.</i>

44:12.399 --> 44:16.362
So I said, "All of you other guys,

"I want you to stop and watch

44:19.448 --> 44:21.950
I held one quarter of a pencil

44:22.451 --> 44:25.371

I put a little drop of superglue

44:25.454 --> 44:30.668

remained cantilevered out over the table.

44:30.959 --> 44:34.421
And they were all like,
"Oh, my God, how did you do that?"

44:38.217 --> 44:42.805
<i>Well, after that, no one ever mentioned</i>
<i>that we were only hired for two months.</i>

JOHN: <i>Everybody had a broad range</i>
<i>of skills that overlapped.</i>

44:48.477 --> 44:50.562

<i>and the camera follows it.</i>

53:35.754 --> 53:37.839
In our world, the camera's moving.

53:43.345 --> 53:47.224
<i>This is because we needed to light</i>
<i>the model with a static light source,</i>

53:47.307 --> 53:48.725
<i>which was supposed to be the sun.</i>

53:48.808 --> 53:52.312
So we wanted the light source
and the model relative to one another

53:52.395 --> 53:53.605
to stay in one place.

53:53.813 --> 53:55.857
The model rotating,
the shadows would change.

53:55.941 --> 53:58.360
<i>The model panning,</i>
<i>the shadows would change.</i>

53:58.443 --> 54:00.654
<i>But if we had moved</i>
<i>the model towards camera,</i>

54:00.737 --> 54:02.614
<i>the light would have had to go on with it,</i>

54:02.697 --> 54:04.366
<i>otherwise, the light would</i>
<i>change on the model.</i>

54:04.449 --> 54:05.659
<i>So we moved the camera.</i>

54:07.702 --> 54:10.580
<i>We put the chosen model on a device</i>

54:10.664 --> 54:13.625
which is also controlled
by the motion control system

54:13.708 --> 54:17.128
<i>so the model can slide back and forth,</i>
<i>go up and down, or rotate.</i>

54:18.088 --> 54:19.673
<i>Then you had to figure out</i>

54:19.756 --> 54:24.052
<i>what kind of camera move</i>
<i>results in the proper subject move.</i>

54:25.637 --> 54:27.597
Invariably the producer comes and says,

54:27.681 --> 54:30.100
"I'd like something
like I've never seen before."

54:30.350 --> 54:32.727
<i>We're always faced with a problem</i>
<i>of trying to figure out</i>

54:32.811 --> 54:35.689
<i>how to get a camera someplace</i>
<i>where it hasn't been before,</i>

54:35.772 --> 54:37.732
<i>or give you a different point of view</i>

54:37.816 --> 54:39.734
<i>than you've ever had before</i>
<i>in that same place.</i>

54:39.818 --> 54:42.654
<i>The thing that they buy</i>
<i>when they come for your talent</i>

54:42.737 --> 54:46.032
<i>is your ingenuity, your ability</i>
<i>to give what you say you can give,</i>

54:46.116 --> 54:50.245
especially when they don't understand it.
They hope you do... (CHUCKLES) basically.

55:24.571 --> 55:27.741
I was not happy.

56:09.616 --> 56:13.411
