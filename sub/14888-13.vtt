'Yes, sir, Mr. Wainwright.'

01:30.066 --> 01:31.466
Marshall and Walpole
have recommended

01:31.500 --> 01:32.600
you for an assignment.

01:32.633 --> 01:34.133
They did?
Well, uh, yes, sir!

01:34.166 --> 01:35.333
I'm your man. What is it?

01:35.366 --> 01:38.100
Political scandal?
Corruption? Drug dealing?

01:38.133 --> 01:39.533
No, they want you to go on
a game show called

01:39.566 --> 01:41.800
"Risk it All".

01:41.833 --> 01:44.033
Interesting.
Uh, well, what is it, Payola?

01:44.066 --> 01:45.800
Show's fixed?
What's the angle?

01:45.833 --> 01:47.766
The angle is Marshall
and Walpole don't want to do it.

01:49.666 --> 01:51.366
It's a piece
for the Sunday supplement.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.333
Well, yes, sir,
I‐I'll stay late tonight

01:53.366 --> 01:55.133
and research the history
of game shows

01:55.166 --> 01:56.766
you know, I think
they started on radio.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.433
Appleton, you go on the show

01:59.466 --> 02:02.400
you write 2,000 words about what
it's like to be a contestant.

It's a game show,
it's not Watergate.

02:06.366 --> 02:08.300

gotta be there in 30 minutes.

Cousin, everybody knows
about the stunts.

Why you think
they put us in jumpsuits?

been on television before

a stunt to you

05:17.600 --> 05:19.333
and then I'll ask
you a question.

05:19.366 --> 05:22.100
You can either do the stunt
or answer the question.

05:22.133 --> 05:23.233
‐ You got it?
‐ Got it.

05:23.266 --> 05:24.433
‐ Okay.
‐ Wait a minute, wait a minute.

05:24.466 --> 05:28.133
Uh, Bink, did you say we could
either perform the stunts

05:28.166 --> 05:29.233
or answer the question?

05:29.266 --> 05:31.033
‐ That's right.
‐ Well, yeah.

05:31.066 --> 05:32.666
But Cousin, nobody answers
the question.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.433
I mean, that you can't have
fun that way, can you, Bink?

05:35.466 --> 05:37.200
Well, you could have fun

and you get messy.

cut off his ear?"

is because the paper sent me.

answer the questions

06:38.366 --> 06:40.300

avoid humiliation.

that stunt button

10:42.411 --> 10:45.511
No, no. No, the part where
Bink said that we could quit.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.245
‐ Quit?
‐ Sure.

10:47.278 --> 10:48.511
I've got everything
I need for my story.

10:48.545 --> 10:50.011
Let's just take the money
and get out of here.

10:50.045 --> 10:51.411
Cousin, quit?

10:51.445 --> 10:53.945
We haven't done anything
but answer questions.

10:53.978 --> 10:56.811
We may as well be
on "Jeopardy!"

10:56.845 --> 10:59.778
We don't have any schmutz
on our jumpsuits!

10:59.811 --> 11:02.078
Cousin, I want to do stunts
and win big prizes.

11:02.111 --> 11:03.878
Ah, there it is.

11:03.911 --> 11:06.111
‐ There what is?
‐ Big prizes.

11:06.145 --> 11:08.378
That's how
they suck you in.

11:08.411 --> 11:11.045
Balki, they depend upon the most
basic of all human failings.

11:11.078 --> 11:13.811
Bad posture?

11:13.845 --> 11:15.278
Greed. Greed.

11:15.311 --> 11:16.978
They show you something
every poor

11:17.011 --> 11:18.245
gullible slob wants

11:18.278 --> 11:19.945
like a like a big screen TV..

11:19.978 --> 11:22.545
A big screen TV!
Cousin, let's risk it all!

11:22.578 --> 11:25.111
‐ Please, please, please!
‐ Balki!

11:25.145 --> 11:27.411
‐ It's happening already.
‐ What's happening?

11:27.445 --> 11:29.378
It's the greed monster.

11:36.045 --> 11:37.911
‐ Where?
‐ Inside you.

11:39.878 --> 11:41.378
Inside me?

11:41.411 --> 11:43.078
‐ Like "Alien?"
‐ Yes.

11:44.478 --> 11:47.111
Yes. Yes. Yes, yes.

11:47.145 --> 11:48.845
It starts deep inside you.

11:48.878 --> 11:50.945
And then‐and then
Bink feeds it by

11:50.978 --> 11:51.978
by letting you
win enough

11:52.011 --> 11:53.811
until‐til the greed
takes over

11:53.845 --> 11:55.878
‐ No. No.
‐ And‐and you lose control.

11:55.911 --> 11:57.445
And then Kelly feeds it
even more by showing you

11:57.478 --> 11:59.211
bigger and bigger prizes.

11:59.245 --> 12:02.078
And the greed grows
and grows more and more

12:02.111 --> 12:03.111
until finally..

12:03.145 --> 12:04.878
[screaming]

12:06.411 --> 12:08.278
It's alright,
it's alright.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.111
[panting]

12:10.145 --> 12:12.245
Cousin, why would
Bink and Kelly

12:12.278 --> 12:13.445
do something
like that to me?

12:13.478 --> 12:14.911
Well, they can't
help themselves.

12:14.945 --> 12:16.311
They're part of the system.

12:16.345 --> 12:18.845
But‐but cousin, how could
the greed monster get me?

12:18.878 --> 12:20.178
‐ I'm not a greedy person.
‐ Oh, no.

12:20.211 --> 12:21.211
‐ No?
‐ No.

12:21.245 --> 12:22.478
‐ No. No.
‐ No!

12:22.511 --> 12:25.811
[screaming]

12:25.845 --> 12:27.145
It's alright. It's alright.
It's alright.

12:27.178 --> 12:29.278
Balki, it's not too late.

12:29.311 --> 12:31.078
I'll save you.

12:31.111 --> 12:31.978
Thank you, cousin.

12:32.011 --> 12:33.378
Hey, I know
you'd do the same for me.

12:33.411 --> 12:35.345
Now, when Bink
comes back out here

12:35.378 --> 12:37.411
he's going to tempt you
with some fantastic prizes.

12:37.445 --> 12:40.111
But you have be strong.
You have to resist.

12:40.145 --> 12:43.045
Remember, just say no.

12:45.178 --> 12:47.211
Got it.
I'll be strong, cousin.

12:47.245 --> 12:49.211
Bink, we're back.

12:49.245 --> 12:51.378
Well, we're back.

12:51.411 --> 12:53.378
Well, the big question is now,

12:53.411 --> 12:56.178
will Larry and Balki
keep their $1,000,

12:56.211 --> 12:58.211
or are they going to..

12:58.245 --> 13:00.878
(all)
"Risk It All?"

13:00.911 --> 13:03.111
Now, follow me, fellas,
and I'll show you

13:03.145 --> 13:05.345
what you could
be playing for.

13:05.378 --> 13:07.311
Remember, be strong.

13:07.345 --> 13:09.111
Just say no.

13:09.145 --> 13:10.278
Just say no.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.878
It's a brand new sports car.

13:12.911 --> 13:15.778
‐ 'Kelly, tell 'em about it.'
‐ My pleasure, Bink.

13:15.811 --> 13:18.178
It comes equipped
with all the luxuries

13:18.211 --> 13:20.978
including air conditioning,
CD player

13:21.011 --> 13:23.111
and cellular car phone.

13:23.145 --> 13:24.778
Yes, Balki and Larry,

13:24.811 --> 13:27.011
you could drive
this dream car home

13:27.045 --> 13:28.545
if you're willing to

13:28.578 --> 13:31.145
risk it all.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.378
Well, guys,
what's it gonna be?

13:33.411 --> 13:35.045
Are you gonna risk it all

13:35.078 --> 13:37.245
for that beautiful new car?

13:37.278 --> 13:38.445
What do you think,
audience?

13:38.478 --> 13:39.445
What should they do?

13:39.478 --> 13:42.445
(all)
Risk it all.

13:42.478 --> 13:44.978
We're going to
be strong and just‐‐

13:45.011 --> 13:46.878
Risk it all!

13:46.911 --> 13:49.811
[screaming]

13:49.845 --> 13:52.011
Kelly, they're
going for the car!

13:52.045 --> 13:53.078
[cheering]

13:53.111 --> 13:55.178
Talk about style.

13:55.211 --> 13:58.045
Yeah, that's some car.

13:58.078 --> 14:00.878
Well, the car's nice,
but I was talking about Bink.

14:02.111 --> 14:03.845
Isn't this great?

14:03.878 --> 14:05.845
Yeah, but do you think
they could get a different car?

14:05.878 --> 14:07.278
I don't
look good in red.

14:12.145 --> 14:14.411
Now, are you guys ready
to risk it all

14:14.445 --> 14:16.445
for that beautiful new car?

14:16.478 --> 14:18.545
Give me the question
and give me the car!

14:18.578 --> 14:20.911
But, cousin, we could lose
all of our money.

14:20.945 --> 14:23.478
Alright, now, you may not wanna
answer the question this time.

14:23.511 --> 14:25.878
You may wanna try
this very..

14:25.911 --> 14:27.378
...easy stunt.

14:27.411 --> 14:28.545
Kelly.

14:28.578 --> 14:32.111
It's a little thing
we call Dueling Buckets.

14:32.145 --> 14:34.511
Now, one of you take a beanbag
and throw it at the‐‐

14:34.545 --> 14:36.311
The question!
The question!

14:36.345 --> 14:37.478
Alright.
Alright.

14:37.511 --> 14:39.311
Here's your question.

14:39.345 --> 14:43.811
"Whose picture was
on the $10,000 bill?"

14:43.845 --> 14:45.311
Salmon P. Chase.

14:45.345 --> 14:47.111
That's absolutely right.

14:47.145 --> 14:49.978
[cheering]

14:50.011 --> 14:51.811
(Bink)
'They've won the car.'

14:53.045 --> 14:55.145
Oh, boy.
Oh, gosh.

14:55.178 --> 14:57.045
I'm so relieved.
Thank you, Bink.

14:57.078 --> 14:59.045
Come on, cousin, let's take
the car and get outta here.

14:59.078 --> 15:00.778
Wait. Don't go yet.

15:00.811 --> 15:02.111
[siren buzzing]

15:02.145 --> 15:04.878
It's time for
the bonus round.

15:04.911 --> 15:07.011
It's the bonus round!

15:08.945 --> 15:11.878
Cousin, cousin...no, uh..

15:11.911 --> 15:13.345
Cousin, be‐be careful.
We could lose everything.

15:13.378 --> 15:15.511
What's the bonus prize?

15:15.545 --> 15:17.478
'The bonus prize?'

15:17.511 --> 15:21.078
It's a cruise
around the world.

15:21.111 --> 15:22.378
(Bink)
'Oh, God.'

15:22.411 --> 15:24.178
That's right.

15:24.211 --> 15:25.978
You'll be cruising
in style

15:26.011 --> 15:28.045
because, we're
going to throw in

15:28.078 --> 15:32.145
Twenty five thousand dollars
in cash.

15:32.178 --> 15:34.278
Now, what should
they do, audience?

15:34.311 --> 15:37.111
(all)
Risk it all!

15:37.145 --> 15:39.078
We'll risk it all.

15:39.111 --> 15:40.878
‐ No, we won't!
‐ Yes, we will!

15:40.911 --> 15:42.011
‐ No, we won't!
‐ Yes, we will!

15:42.045 --> 15:43.845
No, we won't!

15:43.878 --> 15:45.778
We'll risk it all.

15:45.811 --> 15:47.078
They're gonna
risk it all.

15:47.111 --> 15:49.345
[applauding]

15:51.845 --> 15:53.978
Bink..

15:54.011 --> 15:55.311
...I know you can't
help yourself

15:55.345 --> 15:58.378
but you're really starting
to flea and tick me off.

16:03.111 --> 16:05.045
Now, in order for you

16:05.078 --> 16:06.078
to keep the car

16:06.111 --> 16:08.945
and win the trip
and the cash

16:08.978 --> 16:11.211
you're gonna have to either
answer the question

16:11.245 --> 16:13.511
or do all the stunts

16:13.545 --> 16:16.245
you didn't do on your way
to the bonus round

16:16.278 --> 16:18.845
Plus, one more.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.878
‐ Kelly.
‐ That's right, Bink.

16:20.911 --> 16:22.978
It's Bobbing For Bananas.

16:34.378 --> 16:37.811
Now, for your trip
around the world

16:37.845 --> 16:39.211
here is your question.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.978
"What land did the Roman Emperor

16:55.011 --> 16:59.011
Claudius Annex in 43 A. D.?"

16:59.511 --> 17:01.245
Oh, my Lord.

17:01.278 --> 17:05.045
Now, do you wanna answer
the question or do the stunt?

17:05.078 --> 17:06.810
Balki, I don't
know the answer.

17:06.845 --> 17:07.978
We're gonna have to
do the stunt.

17:08.011 --> 17:09.778
They're gonna
do the stunt.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.211
[crowd applauding]

17:14.145 --> 17:15.377
Cousin,
why did you do that?

17:15.411 --> 17:16.978
The answer is
Great Britain.

17:17.011 --> 17:19.178
Great Britain!
The answer is Great Britain!

17:19.211 --> 17:21.078
Good answer!
And a right answer.

17:21.111 --> 17:23.011
‐ Yes! Yes!
‐ But a late answer.

17:23.045 --> 17:25.211
You chose the stunt.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.244
What do you mean,
a late answer?

17:26.278 --> 17:29.278
I want that trip.

17:29.311 --> 17:31.278
Gentlemen,
you'll have three minutes.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.811
Remember, if you don't
complete all the stunts

17:33.845 --> 17:35.945
before the buzzer sounds

17:35.978 --> 17:38.145
you'll lose the car, the trip

17:38.178 --> 17:40.311
the cash, everything.

17:40.345 --> 17:43.111
But, to make sure
that you go from one stunt

17:43.145 --> 17:45.245
to the next in style

17:45.278 --> 17:46.911
you'll be riding

17:46.945 --> 17:49.478
the "Risk It all" commode cab.

17:49.511 --> 17:51.111
(Bink)
'Kelly.'

17:54.311 --> 17:56.011
That's right, Bink.

17:56.045 --> 17:58.011
It's an American Imperial
Whisper Flush

17:58.045 --> 17:59.945
with a patent
cushion seat

17:59.978 --> 18:02.045
compliments of Cunningham
hardware

18:02.078 --> 18:04.378
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

18:04.411 --> 18:05.811
Ready?

18:08.078 --> 18:09.478
Set!

18:11.511 --> 18:12.978
Go.

18:13.011 --> 18:14.945
Alright, the first stunt

18:14.978 --> 18:16.845
is the Sit On It

18:16.878 --> 18:18.278
where they have to
sit on the balloons

18:18.311 --> 18:19.911
filled with whipped cream.

18:19.945 --> 18:21.278
They have to break
them all.

18:21.311 --> 18:23.245
'There's three.
There's four. Alright.'

18:23.278 --> 18:24.911
You can get back
onto the commode.

18:24.945 --> 18:27.978
Balki! Balki!
Come on.

18:28.011 --> 18:29.545
Back onto
the commode cab.

18:29.578 --> 18:31.411
The next stunt
is going to be

18:31.445 --> 18:33.211
Dueling The Buckets.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.545
Dueling Buckets.

18:34.578 --> 18:35.878
We're here.

18:35.911 --> 18:37.811
'Okay, all you have to do'

18:37.845 --> 18:39.211
'is throw the beanbags'

18:39.245 --> 18:42.145
into the targets
and knock those buckets

18:42.178 --> 18:43.511
down on Balki's head.

18:43.545 --> 18:45.045
And good luck.

18:45.078 --> 18:47.145
Shot, oh. He missed
with the first one.

18:48.145 --> 18:50.078
[crowd applauding]

18:52.145 --> 18:53.545
It's a nice job.

18:53.578 --> 18:55.245
Alright, now,
back to the commode.

18:55.278 --> 18:58.245
Get away on it.
On the commode cab.

18:58.278 --> 19:00.845
And‐and the next stunt
will be

19:00.878 --> 19:02.211
'the Wheel Of Schmutz.'

19:04.078 --> 19:08.045
Get over there
to the Wheel Of Schmutz.

19:08.078 --> 19:10.111
Now, on the Wheel Of Schmutz

19:10.145 --> 19:12.278
you have to reach
into the buckets of schmutz

19:12.311 --> 19:14.445
and grab four necklaces

19:14.478 --> 19:16.211
and put them
around your neck.

19:17.878 --> 19:19.978
'Grab the necklaces.
Onto the neck they go.'

19:20.011 --> 19:21.845
'I see three.'

19:21.878 --> 19:24.145
We need one more.

19:24.178 --> 19:25.878
There you go.
You got four.

19:25.911 --> 19:27.911
Back on to the commode cab.

19:29.045 --> 19:30.378
Come on, fellas.

19:30.411 --> 19:32.178
'You don't wanna
waste time here.'

19:32.211 --> 19:34.245
'Get on the commode cab.'

19:34.278 --> 19:35.978
'The next stunt
will be'

19:36.011 --> 19:37.978
'Flying Chickens.'

19:38.011 --> 19:39.378
Flying Chickens.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.245
You know how that works, guys.

19:41.278 --> 19:44.111
You have to catapult
one chicken up in air

19:44.145 --> 19:47.178
and catch it
in the bucket of barbecue sauce.

19:47.211 --> 19:50.245
Here comes one.
They seems got it.

19:50.278 --> 19:52.545
'That's one.
You have to get one each.'

19:52.578 --> 19:54.411
One each.

19:54.445 --> 19:56.811
'You gotta throw that thing.
Here it comes.'

19:56.845 --> 19:58.978
Oh, this looks good.

19:59.011 --> 20:00.411
(all)
Oh.

20:00.445 --> 20:02.511
Make it land into the bucket
of barbecue sauce.

20:02.545 --> 20:04.978
‐ This is good.
‐ Oh!

20:05.011 --> 20:07.878
‐ Yes, we've won.
‐ No, put that down.

20:07.911 --> 20:10.145
I don't want your
bucket of barbecue sauce.

20:10.178 --> 20:11.878
Onto the commode cab.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.545
'Time's running out.'

20:13.578 --> 20:15.845
'One stunt remaining.'

20:15.878 --> 20:18.178
'One stunt remaining.'

20:18.211 --> 20:20.278
And that is the bonus stunt.

20:20.311 --> 20:22.178
‐ Bobbing For Bananas.
‐ Kelly.

20:22.211 --> 20:23.011
That's right.

20:23.045 --> 20:25.311
You've got to pull out
four bananas

20:25.345 --> 20:27.078
without using
your hands.

20:27.111 --> 20:28.445
'Four bananas.'

20:28.478 --> 20:30.978
Hurry up.
Time's running out.

20:31.011 --> 20:32.511
'Time is running out.'

20:32.545 --> 20:33.911
There's one.

20:33.945 --> 20:35.511
There's one banana.

20:35.545 --> 20:37.078
Is there one down there?

20:37.111 --> 20:38.245
Oh. There is two.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.878
Oh.

20:39.911 --> 20:42.211
There's three.

20:42.245 --> 20:43.311
Five.

20:43.345 --> 20:44.845
'Four.'

20:44.878 --> 20:46.011
Three.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.111
Two.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.111
'One.'

20:48.145 --> 20:49.878
[buzzing]

20:51.345 --> 20:54.011
(Bink)
'Too bad.'

20:54.045 --> 20:56.045
You're all
out of time.

20:56.078 --> 20:59.011
You lose everything.

21:01.245 --> 21:03.145
Cousin.
Cousin.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.345
[panting]

21:04.378 --> 21:06.211
Uh, time's up.

21:06.245 --> 21:08.478
[gasps]
I can't lose.

21:08.511 --> 21:10.245
I want that trip.

21:13.278 --> 21:16.145
Cousin. Cousin.
Cousin!

21:16.178 --> 21:17.811
It's‐it's over.

21:17.845 --> 21:19.545
It's over.
We lost everything.

21:19.578 --> 21:22.378
(Bink)
'How about it?
Weren't they great?'

21:22.411 --> 21:24.145
[applauding]

21:35.178 --> 21:37.111
Hey, Balki

21:37.145 --> 21:39.978
So, we didn't win the big prize,
the important thing is

21:40.011 --> 21:41.311
I got everything
I need for my article.

21:41.345 --> 21:42.978
Hey, I'm a reporter.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.178
I had a job to do
and I did it.

21:45.211 --> 21:46.478
I should be
proud of myself.

21:46.511 --> 21:47.545
I should feel good.

21:47.578 --> 21:49.378
But, you feel like schmutz.

21:49.411 --> 21:51.845
[sobbing]

21:53.011 --> 21:53.845
Cousin..

21:53.878 --> 21:57.378
I coulda had
a trip around the world

21:57.411 --> 21:59.445
I coulda had a sports car.

21:59.478 --> 22:00.945
I'd look good
in a sports car.

22:00.978 --> 22:02.911
Yeah, I know,
cousin, it's okay.

22:02.945 --> 22:04.411
It's‐it's alright.
It'll pass.

22:04.445 --> 22:06.845
This, too, will pass.

22:06.878 --> 22:09.311
But, I wanted to win.

22:09.345 --> 22:10.545
Now, look.

22:10.578 --> 22:11.778
We didn't lose everything.

22:11.811 --> 22:13.311
We got to go on television.

22:13.345 --> 22:15.878
We got to stuck our heads
in chocolate fudge.

22:15.911 --> 22:17.978
You got to ride
around on a toilet.

22:19.978 --> 22:21.911
And you see that
as a good thing?

22:23.445 --> 22:25.245
It is a good thing.

22:25.278 --> 22:28.011
It's good to let your hair
fall out once in a while.

22:30.245 --> 22:32.011
Well, it was kinda fun
when those

22:32.045 --> 22:34.778
chickens were flyin'.

22:34.811 --> 22:37.311
Bobbing For Bananas
was a blast.

22:37.345 --> 22:39.111
You know, Balki

22:39.145 --> 22:41.278
if I had just had
five more seconds

22:41.311 --> 22:44.778
I think I could have
gotten that last banana.

22:44.811 --> 22:47.345
There is one way
to find out.

22:50.511 --> 22:52.911
I'll get the bananas. You fill
the sink with chocolate fudge.

22:52.945 --> 22:55.878

22:59.311 --> 23:01.945
