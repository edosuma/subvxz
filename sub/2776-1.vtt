01:27.659 --> 01:30.762
I suppose I should, uh...

01:30.826 --> 01:34.430
thank you... for the opportunity,

01:34.493 --> 01:37.494
for choosing me above the others.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.368
Can I ask why me?

01:41.427 --> 01:44.098
With your reputation, your history,

01:44.160 --> 01:47.001
you were clearly the only choice.

02:09.092 --> 02:12.731
Are you the serial killer known as John Doe?

02:15.460 --> 02:16.733
That's for the jury to decide.

02:18.593 --> 02:19.935
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

02:19.993 --> 02:22.801
have you reached a verdict?

02:24.627 --> 02:27.036
Yes, we have, your honor.

02:27.093 --> 02:28.969
Will the defendant please rise?

02:36.960 --> 02:40.394
On the 33 counts of murder, how do you find?

02:53.527 --> 02:56.767
<i>We believe in you, John Doe!</i>

02:56.827 --> 03:00.101
We are standing here today
outside the Supreme Court,

03:00.161 --> 03:02.900
where over 100,000 people have gathered

03:02.960 --> 03:05.938
to await the verdict in the extraordinary trial

03:05.994 --> 03:07.767
of John Doe.

03:07.827 --> 03:11.430
The entire world is watching this bizarre trial,

03:11.493 --> 03:14.471
and nobody knows which way the jury will vote.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.835
But, one thing's for certain.

03:16.894 --> 03:18.838
Whichever way the...

03:18.894 --> 03:20.429
Wait.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.466
It looks like we may have a verdict.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.427
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience.

03:33.494 --> 03:35.869
<i>Not guilty!</i>

03:35.927 --> 03:39.700
This trial is unprecedented in our history.

03:39.760 --> 03:44.068
It has sparked controversy and
evoked emotions worldwide.

03:44.127 --> 03:48.003
We are now in a position to announce

03:48.061 --> 03:52.028
that after many months of
trial and jury deliberation,

03:52.094 --> 03:54.572
we finally have a verdict.

04:16.894 --> 04:18.428
<i>Good evening.</i>

04:18.494 --> 04:20.870
<i>This afternoon we received brutal footage</i>

04:20.928 --> 04:23.565
<i>from a masked man calling himself John Doe.</i>

04:23.628 --> 04:25.799
<i>We must warn you that some viewers</i>

04:25.861 --> 04:28.395
<i>may find the following footage disturbing.</i>

04:28.461 --> 04:30.405
Do you know me?

04:30.461 --> 04:31.768
I'm just like you.

04:36.127 --> 04:38.935
I'm just another face in the crowd.

04:38.995 --> 04:40.438
I'm the guy next door.

04:42.728 --> 04:45.934
Wife, child, mortgage...

04:49.795 --> 04:51.898
a job I hate...

04:51.961 --> 04:53.802
a life I hate...

04:56.494 --> 05:00.064
a life without meaning.

05:00.128 --> 05:01.799
I'm John Doe.

05:07.728 --> 05:09.637
<i>You just witnessed the brutal murder</i>

05:09.695 --> 05:12.366
<i>of retired priest Xavier Edwards.</i>

05:12.428 --> 05:13.906
<i>At this time, it remains a mystery</i>

05:13.961 --> 05:16.598
<i>as to why this man calling himself John Doe</i>

05:16.661 --> 05:17.968
<i>murdered Mr. Edwards.</i>

05:26.429 --> 05:29.998
So, that's the story you ran?

05:30.062 --> 05:31.630
Yes.

05:31.695 --> 05:34.071
Mm-hmm.

05:34.128 --> 05:36.833
It's not unusual for us to edit footage.

05:36.895 --> 05:38.566
We often do it to protect people.

05:38.628 --> 05:40.833
Yeah, I'm familiar with
that concept, Matt, thanks.

05:40.895 --> 05:43.396
But you were withholding
certain aspects of the story,

05:43.462 --> 05:45.700
aspects that were quite clear and self-explanatory

05:45.761 --> 05:47.501
on the footage John Doe supplied.

05:47.562 --> 05:48.664
We were under orders.

05:48.728 --> 05:50.672
From whom?

05:50.728 --> 05:54.002
At that stage, what did you know about John Doe?

05:54.062 --> 05:57.666
Well, nothing really...

05:57.728 --> 06:01.434
only that he had a lot of
information about his victims.

06:01.495 --> 06:05.337
Where do you think that information came from?

06:05.395 --> 06:09.339
He was a very sophisticated
and intelligent predator.

06:09.395 --> 06:12.964
And he seemed to have a wide network.

06:13.028 --> 06:15.836
Exactly when was the task force formed?

06:15.895 --> 06:18.339
I was brought in after the fifth killing.

06:18.395 --> 06:21.998
And Task Force Swordfish was formed.

06:22.062 --> 06:25.836
The pressure to catch him must have been immense.

06:25.896 --> 06:27.874
Absolutely.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.634
We can't have someone running
around killing people, can we?

06:31.696 --> 06:33.605
Justified or not.

06:33.662 --> 06:37.004
"Justified"?

06:37.062 --> 06:39.700
You can cut that last bit out.

07:00.696 --> 07:04.401
So, you were frustrated?

07:04.462 --> 07:06.462
You could say that, yes.

07:06.529 --> 07:07.700
Because you must have understood

07:07.762 --> 07:09.899
that once you released the footage,

07:09.962 --> 07:11.564
you would be fair game?

07:11.629 --> 07:12.936
Of course.

07:12.996 --> 07:15.633
But only half the story was being told.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.571
Well, I think it's fair to say, though,

07:17.629 --> 07:19.402
when you start killing people,

07:19.462 --> 07:21.940
you can't reasonably expect the responsible media

07:21.996 --> 07:23.439
to be on your side.

07:23.495 --> 07:24.973
So media manipulation is something

07:25.029 --> 07:27.439
we should all just accept?

07:27.495 --> 07:29.871
I was aware of what was going
on before the phone call.

07:29.929 --> 07:31.804
I mean, everybody was.

07:31.862 --> 07:33.635
We were a fairly small operation back then,

07:33.696 --> 07:35.470
and, consequently, we were only getting

07:35.529 --> 07:38.474
slightly more information
than the mainstream media

07:38.530 --> 07:39.734
were feeding Joe Public.

07:39.796 --> 07:43.400
- Mm.
- And who did he contact?

07:43.463 --> 07:46.373
He called our head reporter, Sam,

07:46.430 --> 07:48.374
asked if we wanted copies of the murders.

07:48.430 --> 07:49.533
Sam Foley?

07:49.596 --> 07:51.698
Yeah.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.604
And you jumped at that?

07:53.662 --> 07:54.901
Not at first, no.

07:54.962 --> 07:57.803
I'm... not in the habit of promoting murder.

07:57.862 --> 08:00.704
Then why?

08:00.762 --> 08:03.001
He offered us exclusive footage from there on out.

08:03.063 --> 08:05.507
Ah. So you're happy to air murders

08:05.563 --> 08:07.632
as long as you've got the exclusive, Bob?

08:07.697 --> 08:10.368
Come on, Ken.

08:10.430 --> 08:12.465
They weren’t just murders. You know that.

08:12.530 --> 08:16.474
What, so he mentioned his story? His message?

08:16.530 --> 08:19.406
Well, yeah, of course he did, but
I wasn't interested in that.

08:19.463 --> 08:20.839
Why not?

08:20.896 --> 08:22.875
Well, I mean, every nut out there's got his story,

08:22.929 --> 08:25.635
you know, his version of how
the world owes him a living...

08:25.697 --> 08:27.675
how his old man beat him up,
how he never had a choice,

08:27.730 --> 08:28.901
you know, blah, blah, blah.

08:28.962 --> 08:31.736
But John Doe was different?

08:31.797 --> 08:33.399
Well, yeah.

08:33.462 --> 08:35.941
I mean, once I saw the first
two tapes in their entirety,

08:35.996 --> 08:37.736
I knew this was gonna be big.

08:37.797 --> 08:40.467
Bob, clearly, you're motivated by ratings,

08:40.530 --> 08:42.530
therefore money, correct?

08:42.596 --> 08:45.699
Can I ask, was the truth ever a factor?

08:45.763 --> 08:47.536
"The truth"?

08:47.596 --> 08:49.801
Ken, the only truth is

08:49.863 --> 08:52.431
that he killed a shitload of people.

08:52.496 --> 08:55.372
Anything else is just somebody's opinion.

09:00.130 --> 09:04.335
<i>A few days ago John Doe claimed
yet another victim...</i>

09:04.396 --> 09:05.703
<i>his ninth.</i>

09:09.863 --> 09:13.568
<i>Now, people are being killed.</i>

09:13.630 --> 09:16.767
<i>But John Doe has a story to tell.</i>

09:16.830 --> 09:19.364
<i>He's a man on a mission.</i>

09:19.430 --> 09:20.965
<i>And if you are a law-abiding citizen,</i>

09:21.030 --> 09:23.769
<i>then let me tell you something.</i>

09:23.830 --> 09:26.535
<i>You have nothing to fear.</i>

09:49.730 --> 09:51.708
Who the hell are you?

09:51.763 --> 09:53.469
It's OK, Sally. Don't be scared.

09:53.531 --> 09:56.770
Go next door and call your mother.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.638
Good girl.

09:58.697 --> 10:00.607
Do you know who I am?

10:00.664 --> 10:02.937
Get the hell out of my house!

10:02.997 --> 10:04.441
Oh!

10:28.497 --> 10:31.532
You see, Xavier?

10:31.597 --> 10:33.370
I know who you are.

10:55.698 --> 11:00.109
<i>Xavier Edwards was an old man.</i>

11:00.165 --> 11:02.836
<i>But he was the worst kind of old man...</i>

11:02.898 --> 11:08.271
<i>a pedophile, who had been preying on our
innocent children for many, many years.</i>

11:08.531 --> 11:11.032
<i>You've worked it out, right?</i>

11:11.098 --> 11:14.042
<i>There is a method to John Doe's madness.</i>

11:14.098 --> 11:16.974
<i>It isn't random. It isn't meaningless.</i>

11:17.031 --> 11:20.372
<i>You can come out and party...</i>

11:20.431 --> 11:24.500
<i>have a good time, enjoy the nightlife...</i>

11:24.564 --> 11:26.838
<i>because there's nothing to fear,</i>

11:26.898 --> 11:30.399
<i>unless you're on John Doe's list.</i>

11:32.964 --> 11:34.964
Well, it's a little over
the top, wouldn't you say?

11:35.031 --> 11:38.702
Well, it got people watching.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.071
After only a week,

11:40.131 --> 11:43.573
that was viewed more times than
anything else we'd ever done combined.

11:43.698 --> 11:48.474
I think it's fair to say, from looking
at that, that Sam Foley's a fan?

11:49.931 --> 11:53.341
Sam's mother was murdered.

11:53.398 --> 11:56.001
His father never got over it.

11:56.065 --> 11:57.974
Sam was...

11:58.031 --> 12:00.373
He was in therapy for years.

12:00.432 --> 12:02.935
So why Net News? Why Sam Foley?

12:03.065 --> 12:06.407
You could have given your footage to... anyone.

12:06.465 --> 12:08.409
Could I?

12:08.465 --> 12:12.603
I tried the majors, but...
they had their own agenda.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.734
The Internet was the only place
that it could be run, unedited,

12:15.798 --> 12:18.505
instantly, to the whole world.

12:19.565 --> 12:21.736
Some people have suggested...

12:21.799 --> 12:24.367
that you and Sam Foley...

12:24.432 --> 12:27.069
have been working together.

12:29.465 --> 12:31.067
Did you and Mr. Foley

12:31.131 --> 12:34.803
conspire to create this whole scenario?

12:41.999 --> 12:45.636
Sam was just in the right place at the right time.

13:34.565 --> 13:37.736
What made you decide to start
supplying the mainstream media,

13:37.799 --> 13:42.269
or the... the "majors," as you
describe them, with footage again?

13:42.399 --> 13:44.933
Look, what I was doing was obvious.

13:44.999 --> 13:48.034
But, somehow, the reason I was doing it was not.

13:48.099 --> 13:51.771
Now, I figured that if I exposed
what I was doing to more people,

13:51.932 --> 13:55.540
eventually someone somewhere would figure it out.
The world would open its eyes,

13:55.699 --> 13:58.109
and then maybe I could stop.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.803
So you wanted other people to take up your work?

14:00.865 --> 14:02.036
- No.
- You wanted...

14:02.099 --> 14:03.701
you wanted other people to start killing?

14:03.765 --> 14:05.607
No. No.

14:09.700 --> 14:15.637
Millions of people are watching this broadcast,
right now, both here and around the world.

14:16.633 --> 14:20.940
I believe they want the answer
to one... simple question.

14:23.399 --> 14:25.377
Why didn't you just stop?

14:29.032 --> 14:33.430
Because regardless of whether the
message was getting out there or not...

14:33.700 --> 14:36.803
they all deserved to die.

15:07.766 --> 15:13.567
If you believe that we are simply dumb animals that
have developed some level of self-awareness, well,

15:13.599 --> 15:18.739
then you can rationalize taking a life,
because it really doesn't mean anything.

15:18.933 --> 15:20.401
Sure.

15:20.466 --> 15:22.307
But if you believe in the existence of a soul,

15:22.466 --> 15:23.976
something beyond this world, well,

15:24.033 --> 15:26.433
that puts a whole different perspective on it.

15:26.499 --> 15:29.807
So, you're saying John Doe
doesn't believe in the soul.

15:29.866 --> 15:32.901
He just thinks we're all dumb animals.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.841
Oh, not at all.

15:34.900 --> 15:38.867
John Doe is much more complicated than that.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.378
So no accidents this week?

15:48.467 --> 15:49.773
No.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.571
You sure about that?

15:55.766 --> 15:58.835
No, there's no accidents.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.071
Uh...

16:00.133 --> 16:02.577
can you sign my form, please?

16:14.400 --> 16:16.378
We'll get to the form in a minute.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.705
Look, Becky...

16:21.767 --> 16:24.937
it's beyond time for you
to give the shelter a try.

16:27.701 --> 16:29.406
No, I can't leave.

16:29.467 --> 16:33.070
- Yes, you can.
- No, I couldn’t.

16:33.133 --> 16:35.611
He loves me.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.978
You can't live like this.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.011
Well, how would we survive?

16:42.067 --> 16:44.568
I've never had a job.

16:46.033 --> 16:48.338
Hmm? Who's gonna give me a job?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.003
We can take care of that.

16:50.067 --> 16:52.012
You stay at the shelter,
there are training programs.

16:52.067 --> 16:53.568
No.

17:00.434 --> 17:04.301
Tell me, Becky, why is it more
scary to leave than to stay?

17:08.467 --> 17:10.672
Well, what about Taylor?

17:12.134 --> 17:14.334
She'd be devastated.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.337
And...

17:16.400 --> 17:17.844
I mean, she loves her father.

17:17.901 --> 17:19.970
No doubt, but she needs you.

17:20.034 --> 17:24.103
Well, we shouldn't leave. It wouldn't be fair.

17:24.167 --> 17:27.239
He works so hard to support us.

17:28.801 --> 17:31.677
How long do you think it'll be
before Taylor has an accident?

17:31.734 --> 17:33.110
No, he wouldn't.

17:33.168 --> 17:35.668
- Why not?
- He loves her.

17:35.734 --> 17:37.110
He loves her more than anything.

17:37.168 --> 17:38.770
Loves you, too.

17:38.834 --> 17:43.406
Well, that's only when he's been
drinking, and... it's always late.

17:43.667 --> 17:44.804
She's always in bed.

17:44.867 --> 17:46.606
- For now.
- Yeah.

17:46.667 --> 17:49.441
But how long until she gets in the way?

17:49.500 --> 17:52.104
How long until she tries to protect you?

17:52.168 --> 17:57.406
How long before she ends up, in hospital, with
three broken ribs and a fractured skull, or worse?

18:00.468 --> 18:03.911
He'll find us.

18:03.967 --> 18:06.502
I can take care of that, too.

18:07.667 --> 18:08.838
<i>What'd you say?</i>

18:08.901 --> 18:11.106
<i>What'd you fucking say? Huh? Huh?</i>

18:11.168 --> 18:15.839
Don't walk away from me, you fucking scrag!

18:17.867 --> 18:19.038
Fuck!

18:19.101 --> 18:22.079
Fuck.

18:35.735 --> 18:37.610
Think you're a big man.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.976
<i>John Doe continues on his rampage,</i>

18:58.035 --> 19:01.070
<i>with the police seemingly unable to stop him.</i>

19:01.134 --> 19:05.373
<i>Despite the increased police presence
on our streets and in our skies,</i>

19:05.401 --> 19:08.811
<i>the central business district
is still empty after dark,</i>

19:08.868 --> 19:11.539
<i>and businesses continue to hurt.</i>

19:11.601 --> 19:16.138
<i>In related news, Senator Marlene
Brockhurst was today widely criticized...</i>

19:33.735 --> 19:34.906
<i>0-4-2.</i>

19:37.802 --> 19:40.110
I've just been pulled over by the cops.

19:40.169 --> 19:41.544
Shit.

19:43.702 --> 19:45.976
Going a bit fast there, weren't you, sir?

19:46.035 --> 19:47.876
Got your license?

20:08.102 --> 20:09.875
Don't go anywhere.

20:16.968 --> 20:18.809
I think it's over.

20:21.835 --> 20:24.507
That was on the back seat underneath the jacket.

20:29.602 --> 20:32.011
This can't be happening.

20:32.069 --> 20:34.445
I'm not done yet.

20:44.035 --> 20:47.013
<i>You OK down there? Do you need backup?</i>

20:47.069 --> 20:50.946
Negative.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.437
I'm gonna let you off with a warning, Mr. Jones.

20:55.502 --> 20:57.104
Take my advice.

20:57.169 --> 20:59.545
Slow down, take your time.

20:59.602 --> 21:01.942
The last thing you want is
to get pulled over again.

21:02.003 --> 21:03.801
It could really ruin your night.

21:06.402 --> 21:08.039
Thank you, Constable.

21:31.469 --> 21:33.606
Look, I've already been through
this with everyone else.

21:33.669 --> 21:37.639
And if you're here to crawl up my ass for being
the guy who let John Doe go, you're way too late.

21:37.803 --> 21:43.278
No, not at all. I'm just here to ask
why you chose to let John Doe go.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.843
Why would you go and say
something crazy like that?

21:45.903 --> 21:52.100
Well, it seems obvious, looking at John Doe's
footage, Constable, that you knew it was him.

21:52.636 --> 21:55.546
I didn't realize it was him... alright?

21:55.602 --> 21:57.342
End of story.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.005
Go on.

21:59.070 --> 22:01.741
So, what are your views on John Doe?

22:01.803 --> 22:04.608
- Well, I've probably changed my...
- You're asking people about John Doe, right?

22:04.669 --> 22:07.636
- Uh, yes, but I'm just interviewing this...
- Right, well, I'd like to say that I think he is

22:07.636 --> 22:10.742
disgusting, and I think that the police
aren't trying hard enough to find him.

22:10.869 --> 22:13.074
I mean, how many people has he killed now?

22:13.136 --> 22:15.810
- 14? 15?
- 18, actually.

22:15.969 --> 22:17.641
Oh, Jesus.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.477
Well, the streets are gonna
be cleaned up in no time.

22:19.537 --> 22:22.976
And then what is he going to do? He's
gonna start shooting at jaywalkers,

22:23.136 --> 22:28.343
or hammer to death someone for running a red light.
He gets to be judge, jury, and executioner.

22:28.503 --> 22:31.106
- OK, thank you very much for your...
- And that is insane.

22:31.170 --> 22:32.614
- Thank you very much for your...
- That's wrong.

22:32.670 --> 22:33.769
Sorry about that.

22:33.803 --> 22:38.569
There has been criticism aimed at the
police force by the media, by the public,

22:38.704 --> 22:41.614
by politicians for not taking action earlier.

22:41.670 --> 22:45.341
Why did it take so long for
the task force to be set up?

22:45.403 --> 22:47.074
Do you want the official story...

22:47.136 --> 22:49.478
or my opinion?

22:49.537 --> 22:51.708
Start with the official story.

22:51.770 --> 22:55.111
Red tape, procedure, and parliamentary signoff.

22:55.170 --> 22:58.671
OK, and what's your personal take on the subject?

23:00.470 --> 23:03.676
John was killing career criminals.

23:03.737 --> 23:06.578
Reality is...

23:06.637 --> 23:08.478
nobody cared...

23:08.537 --> 23:11.015
till the body count started to climb.

23:11.071 --> 23:13.106
"Nobody cared"?

23:13.170 --> 23:16.580
I've got 23 unsolved homicides... here,

23:16.637 --> 23:19.979
my responsibility.

23:20.037 --> 23:21.912
Case one...

23:21.970 --> 23:24.345
The murder of an innocent young woman.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.881
Case two... John Doe's first victim.

23:26.937 --> 23:28.881
Now, you as a taxpayer...

23:28.937 --> 23:33.677
you tell me which one you want me to focus on.

23:33.737 --> 23:37.438
The murder of an innocent young woman
or the murder of a known pedophile?

23:37.570 --> 23:39.775
But what does it matter who or what they were?

23:39.837 --> 23:40.974
People were being murdered.

23:41.037 --> 23:43.412
It's your job to find the killer.

23:43.470 --> 23:45.778
Sure.

23:45.837 --> 23:48.644
But I only work 14 hours a day.

23:48.704 --> 23:50.579
So what are you saying here, Detective?

23:50.637 --> 23:53.574
Are you implying that you, that the
task force could have worked harder?

23:53.770 --> 23:55.339
You could have caught John Doe earlier?

23:55.404 --> 23:58.840
You could have stopped the killings?
You could have saved lives?

23:59.037 --> 24:02.072
I'm saying John Doe got the attention he deserved.

24:02.137 --> 24:06.274
Well, what do you say to the allegations
that you are not the real John Doe,

24:06.438 --> 24:09.813
that John Doe is another man
or a group of individuals

24:09.870 --> 24:11.075
committing these crimes,

24:11.137 --> 24:13.774
doing these killings in the name of John Doe?

24:13.837 --> 24:15.746
Knowing that won't change anything.

24:15.804 --> 24:16.975
What does it matter?

24:17.037 --> 24:18.413
What matters is,

24:18.471 --> 24:20.380
if there are other perpetrators out there,

24:20.438 --> 24:21.507
they would need to be caught.

24:21.571 --> 24:23.606
They would need to be stopped, yes?

24:23.671 --> 24:26.410
If you say so.

24:26.471 --> 24:29.706
Well, I simply can't believe that
you did these killings on your own.

24:32.571 --> 24:34.549
Killing's easy.

24:36.738 --> 24:39.579
It's living with it that's the hard part.

24:44.037 --> 24:47.504
Stop! No more!

24:47.571 --> 24:49.412
No more!

24:51.137 --> 24:53.411
Don't, please! Stop it!

24:54.970 --> 24:58.039
Stop! stop!

24:58.104 --> 25:00.946
Stop it!

25:01.004 --> 25:03.482
They don't look too concerned, do they?

25:04.771 --> 25:06.680
John Doe has been busy lately,

25:06.738 --> 25:09.875
but I've managed to put
together an update for you.

25:09.938 --> 25:11.882
Double murderer...

25:11.938 --> 25:13.677
child molester...

25:13.738 --> 25:15.113
granny basher...

25:15.171 --> 25:17.116
serial date rapist.

25:17.171 --> 25:22.213
Each one of John Doe's victims faced
our justice system at least once.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.909
And each man was allowed to
walk free with a second chance.

25:26.172 --> 25:28.342
Each one then chose to re-offend,

25:28.404 --> 25:29.905
and either got away scot-free,

25:29.971 --> 25:33.344
or were prosecuted and, for some
reason, allowed to walk free again,

25:33.504 --> 25:36.778
to inflict more pain and more suffering.

25:36.838 --> 25:39.406
So John Doe killed them.

25:39.471 --> 25:40.915
Here's why.

25:40.971 --> 25:42.471
Sons...

25:42.538 --> 25:43.880
daughters...

25:43.938 --> 25:45.938
husbands and wives...

25:46.005 --> 25:52.847
their lives cut tragically short by acts of
violence, stupidity, or just plain evil.

25:53.005 --> 25:56.778
Our world is a very different place without them.

25:56.838 --> 25:59.679
And these are the dead that John Doe speaks for.

25:59.738 --> 26:02.807
What did you think of Sam Foley's quote?

26:02.871 --> 26:05.008
"John Doe speaks for the dead."

26:09.505 --> 26:12.971
I guess it's a way of looking at it.

26:13.038 --> 26:17.608
Is that what you were doing...
speaking for the dead?

26:17.671 --> 26:19.581
Acting for them, perhaps.

26:19.638 --> 26:21.617
In the form of murder?

26:24.871 --> 26:27.046
Can I ask you a question?

26:29.938 --> 26:31.679
Sure.

26:34.672 --> 26:38.877
If you knew that someone was gonna sneak
up behind you, in the car park tonight,

26:39.072 --> 26:42.676
bash you over the head and then cut your throat.

26:42.739 --> 26:46.941
If ten seconds before it happened you had a
vision and absolutely knew it was coming,

26:47.138 --> 26:48.707
then bang...

26:48.772 --> 26:52.614
a hammer appeared in your hand...

26:52.672 --> 26:54.650
what would you do?

26:57.572 --> 27:01.880
Would you be so angry and outraged

27:01.939 --> 27:04.542
that someone would take
something so precious from you

27:04.605 --> 27:07.048
that you would smash his head in?

27:09.605 --> 27:11.049
You could say that the dead that I act for

27:11.105 --> 27:15.050
never got a chance to find out what they would do.

27:16.639 --> 27:19.116
I'm speaking today with Murray Wills...

27:19.172 --> 27:21.582
the leader of a group that calls themselves

27:21.639 --> 27:23.378
"Speak for the Dead."

27:23.439 --> 27:27.411
So, Murray, why exactly are we here today?

27:27.472 --> 27:30.513
We, uh, we want to let as
many people as we can know

27:30.572 --> 27:32.073
that we'll be holding a rally next week...

27:32.139 --> 27:35.011
a march on Parliament House to
show our support for John Doe.

27:35.139 --> 27:38.514
A rally?

27:38.572 --> 27:42.812
What exactly are you hoping
to achieve with this rally?

27:42.872 --> 27:45.440
We just want to let John know that he has support

27:45.505 --> 27:48.381
and he has allies, if he needs them.

27:48.439 --> 27:51.781
So what do you think that you
can do to help John Doe?

27:51.839 --> 27:55.045
What could you do for him?

27:55.106 --> 27:57.674
Whatever he wants.

27:57.739 --> 27:59.648
Whatever he needs.

27:59.706 --> 28:03.548
Are you saying that you might
be prepared to kill for him?

28:05.139 --> 28:07.746
I never said that.

28:07.806 --> 28:09.574
Well, there you go, folks,

28:09.639 --> 28:13.879
a potentially explosive situation...

28:17.839 --> 28:18.882
Fucking kick him.

28:18.939 --> 28:20.440
Kick him again! Kick him.

28:20.506 --> 28:22.506
Yeah!

28:22.573 --> 28:24.880
Don't you.

28:24.939 --> 28:26.712
Huh? Cunt!

28:29.106 --> 28:30.947
Is that all you got? Come here.

28:31.006 --> 28:32.984
Fucking hit him.

28:37.606 --> 28:39.776
Don't fucking come back!

28:39.839 --> 28:43.908
You fucking do that again, I'll kill you!

29:11.807 --> 29:13.751
- Henry.
- Jesse.

29:13.807 --> 29:16.808
Guys, how does it feel getting away with murder?

29:20.740 --> 29:24.048
The court says I'm innocent,
so I'm going home, fellas.

29:24.107 --> 29:26.983
You killed my son!

29:27.040 --> 29:28.779
You murdering bastards!

29:28.840 --> 29:30.613
You killed my son!

29:30.673 --> 29:32.480
That's right, boys. Serve and protect.

29:32.540 --> 29:34.518
Serve and protect.

29:34.573 --> 29:35.744
Excuse me. Coming through.

29:36.674 --> 29:38.380
Piss off. It's been a long day.

29:38.440 --> 29:42.044
His name was Gary, you prick!

29:42.107 --> 29:43.812
You fucking asshole.

29:43.873 --> 29:46.578
- Any comments?
- What do you have to say?

29:46.640 --> 29:49.050
Yes, I'd just like to thank
my QC, Andrew Beaumont.

29:49.107 --> 29:50.413
Did a sterling job.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.375
Any comments, Mr. Mills?

30:04.441 --> 30:05.816
- Mr. Mills?
- Mr. Mills, anything to say?

30:05.873 --> 30:08.374
- You look at me.
- What have you got to say?

30:08.441 --> 30:10.350
He killed my son.

30:12.673 --> 30:15.049
<i>Just before 9:00 AM this morning,</i>

30:15.107 --> 30:17.551
<i>in the foyer of a crowded city building,</i>

30:17.606 --> 30:20.709
<i>the faceless killer, John Doe, struck again.</i>

30:20.773 --> 30:22.380
<i>This time using what appeared to be</i>

30:22.440 --> 30:25.410
<i>a homemade cyanide patch to claim Jesse Sutton,</i>

30:25.474 --> 30:26.849
<i>his 20th victim.</i>

30:30.740 --> 30:32.047
Hey, sweetheart,

30:32.107 --> 30:34.284
- you ever been fucked by a real man?
- Settle down, dude.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.613
What the fuck did you say?

30:35.973 --> 30:37.410
Sorry, man. Sorry.

30:37.474 --> 30:38.948
Pussy.

30:40.007 --> 30:42.950
After you, sweet cheeks.

30:45.574 --> 30:47.418
Call me, sweet arse.

30:47.474 --> 30:48.517
Or text me.

30:48.574 --> 30:50.347
What the fuck?

30:50.407 --> 30:51.578
<i>Or text me.</i>

30:51.641 --> 30:53.280
<i>What the fuck?</i>

30:53.341 --> 30:55.615
He knows where every camera is...

30:55.774 --> 30:57.774
what angle they're set at...

30:57.841 --> 31:00.977
which ones rotate and which ones are still.

31:01.040 --> 31:04.310
What looks like a random kill in a crowd...

31:04.374 --> 31:06.443
is actually a meticulously planned operation.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.484
He must have rehearsed every step.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.644
Knowing that...

31:17.708 --> 31:19.344
that he would have rehearsed it, did

31:19.407 --> 31:21.612
anyone go back and look at earlier footage?

31:21.674 --> 31:24.016
Yes, we reviewed the tapes.

31:24.075 --> 31:26.814
- And what did you find?
- Nothing.

31:26.874 --> 31:28.977
He was a ghost.

31:29.041 --> 31:32.416
It wouldn't have surprised us
if he had military training...

31:32.474 --> 31:37.350
special ops or... black ops even.

31:37.407 --> 31:41.374
Yeah, black ops would've been perfect.

31:41.441 --> 31:44.908
Yeah, but he wasn't a black op, was he?

31:44.974 --> 31:47.111
No.

31:47.175 --> 31:51.812
The punishment no longer fits the crime.

31:51.874 --> 31:55.408
Terrible... horrible...

31:55.474 --> 31:58.914
unforgivable things are
happening each and every day.

31:59.008 --> 32:01.179
It's not supposed to be like that.

32:01.641 --> 32:04.676
We're supposed to respect human life,

32:04.741 --> 32:07.083
honor it, protect it.

32:07.141 --> 32:09.050
But you killed.

32:14.841 --> 32:15.841
Yes, I did.

32:15.908 --> 32:18.886
Well, how do you justify that?

32:18.941 --> 32:20.419
- Justification?
- Yes.

32:24.208 --> 32:26.508
Well, justification's relative.

32:30.175 --> 32:31.517
How do you mean?

32:36.008 --> 32:38.918
OK, let's go back to the car park.

32:38.974 --> 32:40.747
Humor me.

32:43.642 --> 32:46.545
Only, this time you have a gun, and I'm with you.

32:46.609 --> 32:49.280
A man with an ax bursts from the shadows,

32:49.342 --> 32:51.616
raises the ax, ready to bury it in my head.

32:51.675 --> 32:54.744
He starts to swing, and you shoot him.

32:55.008 --> 32:58.052
Justifiable homicide, right?

32:58.108 --> 33:00.609
Well, what if he kills me
before you can shoot him.

33:01.075 --> 33:03.883
Then he turns on you, ax raised, and bang!

33:03.941 --> 33:05.613
You shoot him dead.

33:08.075 --> 33:11.076
Justifiable homicide still, right?

33:14.008 --> 33:17.043
So when does it become murder?

33:17.108 --> 33:19.416
How long after he kills me...

33:19.475 --> 33:22.783
five seconds, ten seconds,

33:22.842 --> 33:24.717
a week, a month?

33:24.775 --> 33:27.912
Alright, you're implying
once the threat has gone.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.082
Clever boy.

33:31.142 --> 33:33.121
That's exactly the point.

33:33.275 --> 33:36.349
Each one of them was a repeat
offender planning to offend again.

33:36.409 --> 33:40.947
The threat they posed was never gone...

33:41.009 --> 33:43.009
until they were gone.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.586
That's an odd way to try and change the world.

33:52.009 --> 33:54.680
The world's a better place now.

33:56.775 --> 34:00.045
So you're saying none of these
people, none of your victims,

34:00.108 --> 34:04.379
had anything positive to contribute to society?

34:06.975 --> 34:09.043
No.

34:26.975 --> 34:29.976
I'm standing today, just outside Parliament House,

34:30.042 --> 34:32.042
where members of the Speak for the Dead movement

34:32.109 --> 34:34.817
are publicly showing their support for John Doe.

34:34.876 --> 34:40.275
As you can see behind me, it has drawn much
support, from both sides of the argument.

34:40.676 --> 34:42.415
<i>John Doe! John Doe!</i>

34:48.043 --> 34:50.521
You all know why we're here today...

34:50.775 --> 34:53.253
to show our support for John Doe.

34:57.109 --> 35:01.554
We all know who John Doe
is and what John Doe does.

35:01.609 --> 35:06.006
But let's get to what's really important. Let's
go beyond that. What happens after John Doe?

35:06.176 --> 35:08.386
He's left us with a choice.

35:08.443 --> 35:09.785
Stay asleep or wake up.

35:10.042 --> 35:11.984
<i>- Wake up!
- Wake up!</i>

35:12.043 --> 35:15.112
This South Australian father, yeah.

35:15.276 --> 35:16.777
A father...

35:17.142 --> 35:20.979
pimped his 10-year-old daughter out,
to over 200 men, at 50 bucks a hit.

35:21.109 --> 35:22.444
<i>- Bastard.
- Hang him.</i>

35:22.510 --> 35:24.388
20 bucks extra for no condom.

35:24.443 --> 35:26.412
This...

35:26.476 --> 35:31.880
this poor girl has every sexually
transmitted disease you can get.

35:32.044 --> 35:34.049
- You know what he got?
- <i>What?</i>

35:34.110 --> 35:35.887
Maximum of ten years jail.

35:35.943 --> 35:37.921
- <i>What kind of justice is that?</i>
- He'll be out in five.

35:38.475 --> 35:40.111
Who here thinks that's right?

35:40.177 --> 35:41.220
<i>No!</i>

35:41.276 --> 35:42.754
Who here thinks that's fair?

35:43.010 --> 35:46.349
- <i>No!</i>
- Who here thinks our-our justice system

35:46.376 --> 35:47.419
got that one right?

35:47.676 --> 35:48.983
<i>No!</i>

35:51.410 --> 35:53.218
- Jeffrey Wilson...
- <i>Fucking joke!</i>

35:53.277 --> 35:54.720
47-year-old...

35:54.877 --> 35:59.185
found guilty of sexual assault on 3
girls under 12 in 4 separate trials.

35:59.509 --> 36:04.148
He raped... and sexually assaulted these
girls over a period of two years.

36:04.244 --> 36:06.619
<i>- Animal!
- Burn him!</i>

36:07.077 --> 36:10.078
Two years!

36:10.143 --> 36:17.946
But get this... before the trials, he had 95
prior convictions... mostly sex offenses.

36:20.610 --> 36:23.550
Jeffrey Wilson is a free man.

36:24.311 --> 36:26.516
He could be here... right now,

36:26.976 --> 36:29.580
amongst us, today.

36:29.643 --> 36:32.552
Are you out there, Jeffrey?

36:32.710 --> 36:34.852
Huh?

36:35.210 --> 36:36.978
Look at the man next to you.

36:37.043 --> 36:39.687
Is it Wilson?

36:39.843 --> 36:43.912
95 prior convictions, allowed to... stroll free.

36:47.377 --> 36:49.920
Look after your kids, people...

36:49.977 --> 36:54.815
because there are hundreds, if not
thousands, of cases like this every year.

36:55.010 --> 36:57.451
- And who's fault is it? Th-th-the government?
- <i>Yes!</i>

36:57.611 --> 36:59.453
- The pigs?
- <i>Yes!</i>

36:59.511 --> 37:01.147
- The criminals?
- <i>Yes!</i>

37:01.210 --> 37:02.711
No, no, no...

37:02.877 --> 37:04.485
No!

37:04.744 --> 37:10.114
It's our fault, every single one of us here!
It's your fault, your fault, your fault...

37:10.144 --> 37:13.621
'cause we've stood by, and we've watched
our-our society, our community...

37:13.677 --> 37:16.754
our way of life be degraded...

37:16.811 --> 37:18.518
be eaten away piece by piece.

37:18.577 --> 37:22.214
We've been...we've been obedient little citizens...

37:22.577 --> 37:25.651
standing in the corner with our mouths
shut, biting our bloody tongues!

37:25.844 --> 37:28.913
<i>- Yeah!
- That's not the answer!</i>

37:28.977 --> 37:32.184
That's right. It's not the answer.

37:32.210 --> 37:33.886
I say it's time to push back.

37:34.044 --> 37:35.749
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- How's that for an answer?

37:35.811 --> 37:37.584
I say it's time we make a stand!

37:37.644 --> 37:40.088
- <i>Yeah! Yes!</i>
- How's that for an answer?

37:40.144 --> 37:43.685
I say it's time we band together...
and demand a change!

37:43.744 --> 37:47.047
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- How's that for a fucking answer?

37:47.078 --> 37:48.719
- What do you say?
- <i>Yes!</i>

37:48.777 --> 37:50.416
- What do you say?
- <i>Yes!</i>

37:50.477 --> 37:52.614
- What do you say?
- <i>Yes!</i>

38:00.179 --> 38:03.256
Minister, Minister, just a minute of your time.

38:03.511 --> 38:07.282
I've told you the same thing every day
for months, Murray. My hands are tied.

38:07.477 --> 38:09.012
- There's nothing I can do.
- But hold on.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.056
You do work for the people, don't you?

38:11.111 --> 38:14.281
'Cause there's hundreds, if not thousands, of
people out there demanding that you do something.

38:14.378 --> 38:17.679
Minister, these people are gonna make their
opinions known at the next election.

38:18.111 --> 38:19.986
Only a fool would ignore them.

38:20.044 --> 38:23.851
I don't know how many times I can explain it to
you. Nothing's going to happen. It's not possible,

38:23.877 --> 38:26.112
not with just a petition.

38:26.178 --> 38:28.852
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.021
I get it.

38:31.478 --> 38:34.279
I finally fucking get it.

38:34.345 --> 38:35.954
You think you're just going to catch John Doe, and

38:36.011 --> 38:39.419
all this is, what, going to fly away?
Just disappear? Magic?

38:39.445 --> 38:40.747
You catch John Doe...

38:40.811 --> 38:44.215
Just give me a fucking second.

38:44.278 --> 38:46.449
You catch John Doe...

38:46.512 --> 38:49.080
and this gets worse for you, mate...

38:49.545 --> 38:51.580
much worse.

38:54.311 --> 38:56.346
Easy, brother, easy.

39:01.178 --> 39:02.451
You're sure this is him?

39:02.712 --> 39:03.781
Definitely.

39:03.844 --> 39:06.844
He still works at the same nightclub
where they killed the kid.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.453
It's step-up time, guys. Take this.

39:16.045 --> 39:18.216
What the hell is he doing?

39:20.612 --> 39:24.222
Let's go get this fucking prick.

39:24.378 --> 39:25.947
Shit, I think he's got a baseball bat.

39:26.111 --> 39:27.453
Look at his-look at his left hand.

39:27.712 --> 39:30.745
Who gives a fuck what he's got? There's
three of us, and there's one of him.

39:30.745 --> 39:32.689
Yeah. Let's do it.

39:43.745 --> 39:45.222
Henry.

39:46.578 --> 39:48.181
Come on!

39:48.345 --> 39:50.121
You!

39:53.112 --> 39:55.021
- You!
- No-no-no!

40:09.912 --> 40:12.117
What do you think, my eyes
are fucking painted on, huh?

40:12.179 --> 40:14.020
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

40:14.079 --> 40:18.217
You think I didn't see you fucking coming, huh?

40:18.379 --> 40:19.757
Stop it!

40:20.612 --> 40:24.749
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up, tough guy.

40:25.712 --> 40:27.384
Fuck you!

40:27.446 --> 40:29.055
Fuck you!

40:29.112 --> 40:31.687
Huh? You're fucking tough now, aren't you?

40:35.845 --> 40:37.789
Hey, John Doe!

40:37.845 --> 40:39.482
You fucking want me?

40:39.546 --> 40:41.114
Come fucking get me!

40:41.179 --> 40:43.487
Stop sending your boys!

40:43.546 --> 40:45.346
Those three boys in the car park...

40:45.412 --> 40:47.689
it went horribly wrong for them.

40:47.745 --> 40:50.587
But it really fired up the
Speak for the Dead movement.

40:50.845 --> 40:52.914
In what way?

40:53.179 --> 40:55.323
They got organized.

40:55.379 --> 40:57.687
They got a full head of
steam, and they went viral.

40:57.845 --> 40:59.351
"Viral"?

40:59.413 --> 41:04.349
They sprung up in every major city,
even the smaller cities and towns.

41:04.878 --> 41:08.481
Beauy, you want this shit or not?
You've got ten minutes.

41:10.346 --> 41:12.517
What the fuck do you want?

41:12.579 --> 41:14.521
Turn that fucking thing off.

41:15.379 --> 41:17.279
You don't fucking learn, do you?

41:17.346 --> 41:19.119
Come here, fuckwit.

41:19.279 --> 41:21.188
Oh, that's right. Fucking run.

41:21.546 --> 41:23.546
I thought you pricks would've
learnt the first time.

41:23.612 --> 41:25.385
You wanted to play? Let's go.

41:25.446 --> 41:26.947
Come on, you and me.

41:27.012 --> 41:28.115
Come on!

41:28.179 --> 41:30.020
What are you waiting for?

41:30.079 --> 41:31.989
Oi!

42:10.013 --> 42:12.953
Did you mastermind the rise of
the Speak for the Dead movement?

42:13.113 --> 42:15.257
No, not at all.

42:15.313 --> 42:21.986
We have information here... that reveals that Mr.
Murray Wills was receiving counseling from you

42:22.080 --> 42:23.980
- for many years.
- That's true.

42:24.046 --> 42:26.221
- So you're not denying that connection?
- No, not at all.

42:26.281 --> 42:29.188
In fact, I did consider Murray
to be one of my successes.

42:29.447 --> 42:30.590
Because of Speak for the Dead?

42:30.646 --> 42:34.084
No, because he managed to work through
his issues, which were considerable.

42:34.746 --> 42:38.247
You do realize that the Speak
for the Dead movement...

42:38.314 --> 42:42.520
that Murray Wills... is now
completely out of control?

42:44.846 --> 42:46.347
Yes, I do.

42:49.481 --> 42:52.382
Well, I... I guess Mr. Wills must have
had other issues to work through?

42:52.747 --> 42:56.187
Of course he's got other issues. The guy
was abused as a child by his own dad.

42:56.613 --> 42:58.750
- He managed to get out of that household, at last.
- Right. Is it fair to say...

42:58.847 --> 43:00.856
- Came to me for help, and he was on the right
- Is it fair to say, that if you, is it fair

43:00.913 --> 43:03.187
- track.
- fair to say, that if you were still out there,

43:03.447 --> 43:05.719
if you were a free man...

43:06.180 --> 43:09.317
that Mr. Wills would be on your list?

43:12.781 --> 43:18.354
Does it irritate you that your... main
disciple seems to have lost his way?

43:21.681 --> 43:25.124
He's not my disciple.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.281
<i>Today we received this message from John Doe.</i>

43:31.347 --> 43:33.056
<i>It looks like John Doe's motivation</i>

43:33.113 --> 43:35.318
<i>is a lot simpler than it first appeared.</i>

43:35.880 --> 43:40.477
The brutal bashing of Henry Junig has
forced me to re-evaluate what I am doing.

43:40.847 --> 43:42.782
This was never meant to happen.

43:42.848 --> 43:45.519
It was never meant to go this far.

43:46.180 --> 43:49.123
For $10 million, I will walk away...

43:49.180 --> 43:51.454
and the killings will stop.

43:53.814 --> 43:55.651
<i>The serial killer known as John Doe</i>

43:55.714 --> 43:57.453
<i>is today attempting to blackmail</i>

43:57.514 --> 44:00.424
<i>the Australian government for $10 million.</i>

44:14.647 --> 44:15.984
<i>Is today attempting to blackmail</i>

44:16.048 --> 44:19.390
<i>the Australian government for 7.5 million pounds.</i>

44:25.081 --> 44:26.749
<i>All call signs, all call signs.</i>

44:26.814 --> 44:29.315
<i>Suspect John Doe positively ID'd.</i>

44:29.680 --> 44:30.787
<i>Be ready.</i>

44:30.847 --> 44:32.518
<i>Stand by.</i>

44:32.580 --> 44:34.490
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

44:40.081 --> 44:42.116
Police! Don't move!

44:46.880 --> 44:48.858
- Get down!
- On the ground!

44:53.781 --> 44:55.589
Stay there! Don't move!

44:56.047 --> 44:57.225
Listen to me.

44:57.281 --> 44:59.479
If you move, you're fucking dead.

44:59.981 --> 45:01.925
Well, I didn't run the story, did I?

45:01.981 --> 45:03.689
So you knew it wasn't John Doe?

45:03.748 --> 45:05.148
Of course.

45:05.214 --> 45:08.124
I just can't believe everybody fell for it.

45:08.181 --> 45:11.857
I guess it goes to show you the
power and stupidity of the media.

45:13.515 --> 45:18.185
A word to the wise, Sam... don't
bite the hand that feeds you.

45:19.448 --> 45:22.758
You obviously had a working relationship
with John Doe. My question is...

45:22.814 --> 45:25.553
how did you keep the police out of it?

45:26.414 --> 45:28.756
He sent me tapes.

45:28.815 --> 45:32.291
You had footage while bodies were still
being loaded onto coroner's wagons.

45:32.315 --> 45:34.520
He did more than send you tapes.

45:34.581 --> 45:36.422
He sent me tapes.

45:37.682 --> 45:40.216
The public aren't idiots, Sam.

45:40.281 --> 45:42.623
Neither am I.

45:43.081 --> 45:45.685
Some people have suggested that you and John Doe

45:45.748 --> 45:49.690
were working together from the very beginning,
that you may have even planned this, all of it...

45:49.815 --> 45:51.549
the murders, everything.

45:51.615 --> 45:53.290
Really?

45:53.548 --> 45:56.916
Well, I guess some people have pretty
vivid imaginations, don't they?

45:56.982 --> 45:58.516
Some people claim to have proof.

45:58.682 --> 46:00.216
What proof, Ken?

46:09.648 --> 46:12.852
This whole... eye-for-an-eye thing.

46:12.915 --> 46:15.518
It's not really justice, is it?

46:15.782 --> 46:17.285
Well, it seems to be working.

46:17.349 --> 46:21.554
Oh, so... bring back capital punishment,

46:21.615 --> 46:24.287
the noose, firing squad?

46:24.748 --> 46:27.455
I never said that.

46:27.514 --> 46:31.322
Look, I'm not gonna sit here and
pretend to have all the answers, Ken.

46:31.415 --> 46:37.347
But what I do know is the system
as it stands... it doesn't work.

46:37.615 --> 46:40.015
We're too politically correct.

46:40.082 --> 46:45.481
It's all about the perp's rights. The preps get
their way. The victims end up getting screwed.

46:45.715 --> 46:48.923
And when you go to court, if you're
lucky enough to actually get to court,

46:48.949 --> 46:52.052
the courts end up editing the
victim's impact statement.

46:52.415 --> 46:57.186
Why? To reduce the impact. It's fucking insane.

46:57.516 --> 47:01.052
I mean, the victims end up
becoming victims all over again.

47:03.015 --> 47:05.459
I hate the apathy.

47:05.915 --> 47:10.785
I hate the way everybody just sits back and expects
somebody else to take care of the problem.

47:12.615 --> 47:15.559
Like the Speak for the Dead movement?

47:15.615 --> 47:19.490
Well, I mean, apart from giving them
a very catchy name, Sam, can I ask?

47:19.582 --> 47:23.316
Do you feel in any way responsible
for the rise of Speak for the Dead?

47:23.849 --> 47:27.052
Sure. I played my part.

47:27.115 --> 47:29.484
And people have died.

47:29.849 --> 47:32.356
Yes.

47:32.716 --> 47:36.660
But, it was their choice to
represent Speak for the Dead.

47:36.716 --> 47:38.785
It was a risk that they were
willing to take as soldiers.

47:39.148 --> 47:41.225
- "As soldiers"?
- Oh, I think that's how they'd see it.

47:41.316 --> 47:44.089
Well, how do you see it, Sam?

47:44.649 --> 47:47.488
A vigilante is simply
somebody who violates the law

47:47.549 --> 47:51.225
in order to punish a criminal
for what they believe is right...

47:51.282 --> 47:54.022
for what they believe is justice.

47:54.083 --> 47:56.817
So what then do you call a
country who sends soldiers

47:56.883 --> 47:59.091
to kill people in places like Afghanistan

47:59.150 --> 48:01.659
or Iran, Iraq, Korea, Vietnam...

48:01.916 --> 48:03.489
in the name of what they believe is right,

48:03.549 --> 48:06.926
in the name of what they believe is justice?

48:07.382 --> 48:11.088
That country is a vigilante, pure and simple.

48:11.349 --> 48:15.623
Only, when a country does it, people
call it war, and nobody bats an eyelid.

48:15.916 --> 48:17.860
But when a country does it,
they aren't anywhere near as

48:17.916 --> 48:21.860
clinical or as careful... as someone like John Doe.

48:21.916 --> 48:28.286
And that country ends up killing thousands,
of innocent women... and innocent children.

48:28.350 --> 48:30.354
Oh, collateral damage.

48:30.816 --> 48:32.953
So, you're comparing what's
happening here to a war?

48:33.216 --> 48:36.616
Of course I am, Ken. Make no mistake about it.

48:36.682 --> 48:40.490
It is a war that is being fought. It is a
war for justice. It is a war against crime.

48:40.916 --> 48:43.826
And it is a war with victims.

48:46.616 --> 48:49.493
<i>I just want my boy back.</i>

48:52.417 --> 48:54.122
How did that make you feel, John?

48:57.683 --> 49:01.327
It makes me sad. I feel for her.

49:11.283 --> 49:14.693
Kate Johnson is one of the
many victims that you...

49:14.949 --> 49:16.050
have created.

49:16.116 --> 49:19.124
You... you killed her son.

49:22.550 --> 49:24.728
Yes, I did.

49:24.784 --> 49:27.728
And you feel bad for her?

49:27.983 --> 49:29.893
Of course.

49:29.950 --> 49:32.019
For him, too.

49:34.250 --> 49:36.660
How so? Uhm...

49:37.116 --> 49:39.060
I don't follow.

49:43.116 --> 49:47.891
I feel sorry for him in the
same way that you do...

49:47.950 --> 49:52.825
when you feel sorry for squashing a-a
deadly spider in your kid's tree house.

49:53.950 --> 49:57.187
You don't really want to kill the spider, but...

49:57.250 --> 49:59.594
you got to protect your kids.

50:01.550 --> 50:05.457
What about the lawyers? Let's talk about them.

50:05.483 --> 50:08.359
Who was protected by maiming and torturing them?

50:08.417 --> 50:10.659
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

50:10.717 --> 50:12.991
"Unfortunate"?

50:14.851 --> 50:17.328
You don't feel responsible?

50:23.884 --> 50:26.589
Was Jesus responsible for the Crusades,

50:26.750 --> 50:29.392
for the Inquisitions?

50:29.450 --> 50:33.361
Mohammed... was he responsible for 9/11?

50:39.917 --> 50:43.751
- This is too much.
- We discussed this. This is what you wanted.

50:43.783 --> 50:46.555
- I didn't think it'd be like this.
- Yeah, well, that's what it take...

50:46.750 --> 50:49.756
Bill, we're not going to kill them, OK?

50:49.817 --> 50:52.318
We're just gonna make sure that
they never win another trial.

50:52.983 --> 50:54.884
So take the shears. Take-take the shears!

50:54.951 --> 50:56.293
Look me in the eyes.

50:56.551 --> 50:58.851
You do this, and it's over.

50:58.917 --> 51:00.361
You hear me?

51:00.618 --> 51:02.289
Your son can rest in peace.

51:02.351 --> 51:04.124
OK. OK.

51:04.184 --> 51:05.662
Now, get in there...

51:07.750 --> 51:10.058
And do what it is you came here to do.

51:12.217 --> 51:14.252
Ah, for fuck's sake.

51:15.118 --> 51:16.425
You fucking pussy!

51:16.685 --> 51:19.185
Huh? You're nothing!

51:21.917 --> 51:24.895
<i>This morning, Speak for the
Dead leader, Murray Wills,</i>

51:24.950 --> 51:27.786
<i>was taken in for questioning by police.</i>

51:27.851 --> 51:31.624
<i>At this time, it is unknown if
any charges have been laid.</i>

51:32.983 --> 51:33.983
- Murray.
- Murray.

51:34.050 --> 51:35.658
Mr. Wills. Mr. Wills.

51:35.718 --> 51:37.054
- This is bullshit.
- Any comments?

51:37.117 --> 51:38.859
They can't prove anything. It wasn't us.

51:38.918 --> 51:40.686
A bunch of fat cat lawyers, you hear me?

51:40.851 --> 51:42.089
Who gives a shit?

51:45.217 --> 51:46.718
You think so?

51:46.885 --> 51:49.419
The Speak for the Dead movement is now at what...

51:49.484 --> 51:51.920
- 10, 12 million worldwide?
- Mm-hmm.

51:52.284 --> 51:55.124
The word is, they are threatening
action, if John is convicted.

51:55.852 --> 51:57.420
Really?

51:57.485 --> 52:00.285
Well, what could they
possibly do, in your opinion?

52:00.651 --> 52:02.720
I don't know.

52:02.784 --> 52:05.385
But we're sitting here talking
because of one person.

52:05.451 --> 52:06.991
Look at what he did.

52:07.052 --> 52:09.290
Imagine what a few million John Does could do.

52:11.818 --> 52:13.796
I'll tell you what I do know.

52:13.852 --> 52:17.519
I know that I have signed statements...
from 32 different people...

52:18.252 --> 52:20.820
one for the date and time of each killing.

52:21.085 --> 52:24.460
These statements put John Doe
on the other side of town...

52:24.718 --> 52:28.188
in some cases in another state,
when the murders were committed.

52:29.018 --> 52:33.451
Signed by the family and friends of the
victims he was speaking for, no doubt.

52:33.451 --> 52:35.157
Maybe.

52:35.218 --> 52:39.057
But the only thing resembling evidence they
have is the footage from the final killing.

52:39.651 --> 52:42.423
And we can argue that he only did the last one,

52:42.484 --> 52:45.258
that all the others were someone else.

52:45.319 --> 52:47.194
We can plead temporary insanity...

52:47.252 --> 52:49.323
and that he was inspired by the John Doe killings.

52:49.385 --> 52:53.557
Wha-and then chose to admit to 32 other killings.

52:54.118 --> 52:56.958
- Why?
- Because of the message.

52:59.119 --> 53:03.527
So you're saying he chose to become
John Doe, whoever that may be.

53:03.818 --> 53:05.353
That's the argument we'll be presenting.

53:05.419 --> 53:08.953
Is it an argument with any basis in fact, Alan?
Do you believe it?

53:08.984 --> 53:11.087
Doesn't matter what I believe.

53:11.151 --> 53:14.095
It doesn't matter what you believe.

53:14.151 --> 53:16.890
It only matters what the jury believes.

53:18.419 --> 53:23.259
<i>I need people to understand...</i>

53:23.519 --> 53:27.122
<i>what it was and what it is like.</i>

53:29.419 --> 53:33.056
<i>It's-it's the last time you
ever open a door without fear.</i>

53:34.918 --> 53:38.326
<i>It's having the safety and security
of your own home violated...</i>

53:40.752 --> 53:43.730
<i>taken from you, forever.</i>

53:53.252 --> 53:55.856
<i>It's running down the street...</i>

53:56.118 --> 54:00.460
<i>half-naked... covered in blood...</i>

54:00.519 --> 54:02.428
<i>screaming for help...</i>

54:02.485 --> 54:07.055
<i>praying that someone, anyone will come.</i>

54:07.119 --> 54:09.255
<i>But no one does.</i>

54:17.318 --> 54:19.787
<i>It's guilt...</i>

54:19.852 --> 54:23.923
<i>mercilessly punishing yourself over
whether you could have done something...</i>

54:24.186 --> 54:27.187
<i>anything at all, to have stopped him.</i>

54:28.252 --> 54:33.354
<i>It's having to tell your husband
that she's gone and then waiting...</i>

54:33.952 --> 54:37.388
<i>hoping that she'll be found,
but knowing in your heart...</i>

54:37.452 --> 54:39.362
<i>she never will.</i>

54:43.985 --> 54:47.656
<i>It's identifying her body and seeing...</i>

54:48.886 --> 54:52.194
<i>seeing her dead, lifeless face.</i>

54:58.086 --> 55:00.723
<i>All I have left...</i>

55:03.019 --> 55:06.327
<i>All I have left is... the hope...</i>

55:06.586 --> 55:09.530
<i>that there is more to this world...</i>

55:09.685 --> 55:12.427
<i>this life that we know.</i>

55:12.486 --> 55:16.259
<i>And that one day somewhere else, someplace else...</i>

55:17.752 --> 55:22.054
<i>One day, I'll be able to hold her again...</i>

55:22.120 --> 55:25.530
<i>and look into her beautiful eyes...</i>

55:27.453 --> 55:31.522
<i>and tell her how much I love her.</i>

55:44.519 --> 55:47.793
And then came Adam McCleish.

55:49.586 --> 55:51.222
Yes.

55:51.686 --> 55:54.126
Adam McCleish.

55:54.586 --> 55:56.723
That's funny to you, John?

55:59.286 --> 56:02.457
Nothing funny about Adam McCleish.

56:22.486 --> 56:25.094
NetNews ran the whole thing, live, uncensored.

56:25.154 --> 56:29.461
They got prosecuted for that, as we probably
would have had we run the full story, early on.

56:31.220 --> 56:34.198
Matt, do you regret not running the footage?

56:34.453 --> 56:35.663
No.

56:35.720 --> 56:37.221
Why did you choose not to run it?

56:39.153 --> 56:43.756
We are a major television network... and
we're governed by rules and regulations.

56:43.854 --> 56:48.156
This isn't NetNews. Those rules and
regulations need to be adhered to.

56:48.254 --> 56:50.728
I did what I felt was right.

56:54.686 --> 56:58.396
When I saw what was happening,
I started shooting the crowd.

56:58.454 --> 57:01.561
This was once-in-a-lifetime stuff.

57:06.521 --> 57:09.055
<i>We hooked the live feed into-into the plasmas.</i>

57:09.120 --> 57:10.398
- What's this?
- Shh.

57:10.454 --> 57:12.159
<i>John Doe had multiple cameras running,</i>

57:12.221 --> 57:16.123
and someone over at NetNews was doing
a kick-ass job of directing the cams.

57:16.254 --> 57:18.461
It was a life-changing experience for me,

57:18.920 --> 57:22.554
as I guess it was for everybody who
watched it or has seen it since.

57:22.621 --> 57:27.526
Mm. So, what is your reply to the accusations
that you knew it was going to happen...

57:27.688 --> 57:31.159
and that you preplanned the
whole thing with John Doe?

57:31.221 --> 57:33.262
- Ridiculous.
- Is it?

57:33.721 --> 57:37.288
Look... we received a message
with an IP address on it.

57:37.354 --> 57:41.560
When we checked it out, we
saw the scene in the garage.

57:41.621 --> 57:44.831
As soon as we realized what was
happening, we called the police.

57:44.888 --> 57:46.258
- As soon as you realized?
- Mm-hmm.

57:46.321 --> 57:48.265
You called the police?

57:51.020 --> 57:54.555
These are the phone records from that night.

57:57.521 --> 57:59.792
According to these records...

57:59.810 --> 58:05.104
the only call, to the police, made from
this office, took place at 8:53 PM.

58:08.254 --> 58:11.494
Sam, that feed went live at 8:30 PM.

58:24.387 --> 58:25.922
Fuck.

58:30.222 --> 58:33.961
Do you know who I am?

58:34.021 --> 58:36.129
Yeah, of course I do, you crazy bastard.

58:36.188 --> 58:39.098
What are you doing? Let me go.

58:39.355 --> 58:41.026
Are you sure you know who I am?

58:41.088 --> 58:44.225
Yeah, you're John Doe, but you've made a mistake.

58:48.222 --> 58:49.927
Have I?

58:50.288 --> 58:51.822
Yeah, I'm not who you think I am.

58:51.888 --> 58:55.096
- I swear to God.
- God?

58:55.155 --> 58:57.260
Careful.

58:57.322 --> 58:59.629
You maybe seeing Him pretty soon.

59:00.188 --> 59:04.164
Wh-whatever you think I've done,
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

59:52.088 --> 59:56.258
So what, you find these out on the street?

59:56.322 --> 59:59.630
I've never seen them before.

59:59.789 --> 01:00:02.396
Oh, they must belong to my flatmate.

01:00:02.455 --> 01:00:03.797
You don't have a flatmate.

01:00:03.856 --> 01:00:06.855
Right-right, not my flatmate.
Sorry. Um, my mate, Robby.

01:00:07.188 --> 01:00:08.989
- Ah, right.
- He stays here all the time.

01:00:09.056 --> 01:00:11.363
Yeah, I let him use my garage to work on his car.

01:00:11.422 --> 01:00:13.233
They must be his.

01:00:14.889 --> 01:00:17.526
You don't have any mates, Adam,
not even one called Robby.

01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:25.430
Help!

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:26.966
Help!

01:00:27.122 --> 01:00:29.257
Somebody!

01:00:29.522 --> 01:00:31.228
Help!

01:00:36.722 --> 01:00:38.325
No point.

01:00:38.989 --> 01:00:43.326
You see, the Henderson's, on that side,
they received free movie tickets tonight,

01:00:43.455 --> 01:00:46.093
in Gold Class, no less.

01:00:46.156 --> 01:00:49.327
And, um... old...

01:00:49.389 --> 01:00:51.424
Mrs. Heywood...

01:00:51.489 --> 01:00:53.524
Well...

01:00:56.223 --> 01:00:58.757
Mrs. Hay-wood!

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.762
Mrs...

01:01:02.822 --> 01:01:04.891
Well, she wouldn't hear it if
you were screaming in her ear.

01:01:05.156 --> 01:01:07.361
Deaf as a post, the old dear.

01:01:08.022 --> 01:01:11.864
How the fuck do you know so much?

01:01:15.189 --> 01:01:19.228
You know, this whole thing will go a lot
easier if you simply tell me the truth.

01:01:19.456 --> 01:01:21.690
A lot easier, I reckon.

01:01:21.956 --> 01:01:26.097
I mean, if you are innocent of the crimes
that, that I believe you have committed,

01:01:26.156 --> 01:01:28.895
then I will walk away.

01:01:28.956 --> 01:01:30.525
Bullshit.

01:01:30.989 --> 01:01:33.090
It's up to you now, Adam.

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:36.134
Only you can save yourself.

01:01:36.189 --> 01:01:39.258
So...

01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:45.767
where did you get the hair?

01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:49.468
Look...

01:01:49.523 --> 01:01:51.966
I-m... I'm pretty messed up.

01:01:52.022 --> 01:01:53.864
I'm into some some weird shit, you know?

01:01:53.923 --> 01:01:58.424
Um, I bought those off a...
a guy I met in... in jail.

01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:01.798
Right, a guy you met in jail?

01:02:01.857 --> 01:02:03.163
What guy?

01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:05.394
Well, um...

01:02:05.656 --> 01:02:06.963
Uh, J-Jimmy.

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:09.067
Uhh... Jimmy, Jimmy Harris.

01:02:09.123 --> 01:02:11.857
- Oh, Jimmy Harris, your old cellmate?
- Yeah, he's a...

01:02:12.189 --> 01:02:13.326
Hang on. How...

01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:17.457
- Go on.
- Well... I got them off him.

01:02:18.023 --> 01:02:19.193
And where did he get them?

01:02:19.256 --> 01:02:23.123
I don't know. I got no fucking idea.
I mean, what does it matter?

01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:29.431
Fuck!

01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:32.998
- "What does it matter?"
- Fuck!

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:36.429
Did you really just fucking say that?

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:39.632
- Fuck.
- Look at them.

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:41.133
No.

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:44.528
- Alright.
- Look at them.

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:49.092
Look at them!

01:02:50.357 --> 01:02:52.732
I count six,

01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:55.734
six girls!

01:02:55.790 --> 01:03:00.132
Six girls that you did fuck knows what to?!

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:02.127
What did you do to them?

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.224
Nothing.

01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:05.961
I swear to God, it wasn't me.

01:03:17.057 --> 01:03:19.057
We shouldn't be watching this.

01:03:19.124 --> 01:03:21.398
Bullshit, man. This is fucking mad.

01:03:21.457 --> 01:03:23.093
It's wrong. They should turn it off.

01:03:23.157 --> 01:03:25.862
Look, mate, if you don't want to watch it,

01:03:25.923 --> 01:03:27.958
then fuck off home.

01:03:28.023 --> 01:03:30.126
<i>Yeah, fuck off, mate.</i>

01:03:32.857 --> 01:03:35.233
<i>Why did you let him walk all over you?</i>

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:39.934
<i>Maybe we should go.</i>

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:42.466
John Doe and Adam McCleish was
the most watched podcast,

01:03:42.524 --> 01:03:46.429
broadcast, whatever you want to call
it, in the history of the world.

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:50.563
Within minutes of it finishing, it was
copied and plastered all over the Internet.

01:03:50.657 --> 01:03:55.959
It has been downloaded and watched
millions, maybe even billions, of times.

01:04:01.557 --> 01:04:03.228
Fuck you!

01:04:04.491 --> 01:04:06.230
Fuck you.

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:08.928
You can't prove anything.

01:04:08.991 --> 01:04:11.093
If you kill me, you're just a fucking murderer.

01:04:11.157 --> 01:04:14.226
- Really?
- Yeah, fucking really.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:17.424
So you think you know who I am?

01:04:18.557 --> 01:04:22.092
Man, you're a broken record.

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:32.963
Fuck.

01:04:33.824 --> 01:04:37.098
Fuck. Fuck.

01:04:37.757 --> 01:04:39.596
Fuck!

01:04:41.058 --> 01:04:42.929
Fuck.

01:05:31.525 --> 01:05:34.366
Open your fucking eyes!

01:05:34.824 --> 01:05:36.829
Look at them!

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:39.301
Look at them!

01:05:43.358 --> 01:05:46.359
Look what you destroyed.

01:05:46.825 --> 01:05:49.860
There's Chloe. Well, y-you know Chloe, right?

01:05:49.924 --> 01:05:52.027
You get that?

01:05:52.191 --> 01:05:54.931
You look at them!

01:05:56.091 --> 01:05:58.026
And that there, that...

01:05:58.091 --> 01:06:00.399
that's Mary.

01:06:00.758 --> 01:06:02.959
Hi, honey.

01:06:03.024 --> 01:06:04.525
She was a nurse.

01:06:04.592 --> 01:06:08.431
Yeah, she used to care for people
who couldn't look after themselves.

01:06:09.291 --> 01:06:11.792
Oh, you know who that is, right?

01:06:17.525 --> 01:06:19.696
Look at them.

01:06:21.158 --> 01:06:23.136
Look, Adam.

01:06:23.391 --> 01:06:27.199
This is a couple of weeks before
you walked into our lives.

01:06:27.458 --> 01:06:30.702
<i>Look how happy we are, man. You see that?</i>

01:06:30.758 --> 01:06:32.596
<i>You see how happy we are?</i>

01:06:32.659 --> 01:06:34.194
I thought he would just kill him, right then.

01:06:34.459 --> 01:06:37.733
You know, bang, just bullet in the head.

01:06:37.992 --> 01:06:42.333
I had no idea what was coming next.

01:06:42.592 --> 01:06:45.832
But then, with John Doe, we never really did.

01:06:49.959 --> 01:06:51.266
Do any of these belong to my daughter?

01:06:51.725 --> 01:06:53.204
No.

01:06:53.859 --> 01:06:55.868
- Don't lie to me.
- I promise. I s... I swear,

01:06:55.925 --> 01:06:57.926
n-none of them are hers.

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:09.825
You have five minutes...

01:07:11.759 --> 01:07:15.135
five minutes to convince me not to kill you.

01:07:15.292 --> 01:07:16.771
What?

01:07:18.725 --> 01:07:21.924
You know, I thought long and hard about
what to do with people like you.

01:07:22.359 --> 01:07:24.166
Should it be an eye for an eye...

01:07:24.226 --> 01:07:26.101
old-style justice?

01:07:26.559 --> 01:07:30.026
I thought maybe that I would take the
wives or the children of the killers.

01:07:30.026 --> 01:07:33.266
You know, I take your father, you take my
mother, that kind of thing, but it just...

01:07:33.324 --> 01:07:35.702
didn't sit right with me.

01:07:35.759 --> 01:07:40.067
And then I thought, "What if... what
if I cripple someone, as payback...

01:07:40.126 --> 01:07:42.235
make them suffer for years and years?"

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:45.369
But then, of course, the taxpayer
would end up footing the bill.

01:07:45.426 --> 01:07:50.657
Hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep
scumbags like you alive and comfortable.

01:07:52.693 --> 01:07:54.295
Look at this.

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:02.634
I buy these in bulk.

01:08:02.693 --> 01:08:04.401
Yeah.

01:08:07.159 --> 01:08:09.100
50 cents apiece.

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:19.837
You do the math.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.167
But you know what?

01:08:29.292 --> 01:08:31.537
I'm done with the killing.

01:08:31.993 --> 01:08:33.493
Yeah.

01:08:33.559 --> 01:08:35.332
- You're the last.
- No.

01:08:35.392 --> 01:08:39.301
But... if you can convince me...

01:08:39.559 --> 01:08:42.060
to let you live...

01:08:43.893 --> 01:08:46.167
you will live.

01:08:46.227 --> 01:08:48.737
But your time's running out.

01:08:49.193 --> 01:08:52.228
- Are you for real?
- What have you got to lose?

01:08:52.292 --> 01:08:54.997
OK, um...

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:58.162
Look... I was a good kid, yeah?

01:08:58.227 --> 01:09:00.261
- Right.
- Um...

01:09:00.327 --> 01:09:03.029
I mixed with some bad... bad
kids, in high school, and

01:09:03.093 --> 01:09:06.267
I got mixed up in drugs, and, you know, next...

01:09:06.327 --> 01:09:09.698
before I know it... I was in
prison for stealing a car.

01:09:09.926 --> 01:09:11.327
I didn't fucking steal it.

01:09:11.493 --> 01:09:12.569
Fucking cops.

01:09:12.626 --> 01:09:13.832
- "Fucking cops"?
- Yeah.

01:09:13.893 --> 01:09:15.098
- The fucking cops?
- Yeah.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.801
They railroaded me and put me in jail.

01:09:18.759 --> 01:09:20.066
And...

01:09:20.526 --> 01:09:24.532
bad things happened... to me in there...
real, real bad things.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.795
I mean, I was just a kid.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.930
- I was just a... bloody, stupid kid.
- Yeah.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.700
I mean, how-how's a kid supposed to...
deal with that shit?

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:39.368
They...they taught me how to...

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:41.371
how to steal...

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:45.064
how to pick locks, how to hurt people...

01:09:47.393 --> 01:09:49.270
how to get girls.

01:09:49.926 --> 01:09:51.301
I...

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:53.337
I can't help myself.

01:09:55.427 --> 01:09:57.166
But you like it?

01:09:57.227 --> 01:09:59.762
I need it.

01:09:59.827 --> 01:10:01.862
But you like it, right?

01:10:01.926 --> 01:10:04.234
The little girls... they get scared.

01:10:04.293 --> 01:10:07.362
They look at you with their big eyes...

01:10:07.427 --> 01:10:09.302
pleading...

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.463
asking to go home, to their mummies and daddies.

01:10:13.326 --> 01:10:15.564
- Made you feel strong, didn't it?
- Yeah.

01:10:15.927 --> 01:10:18.328
Made you feel good.

01:10:18.493 --> 01:10:20.532
It's OK. Say it. Say it.

01:10:20.594 --> 01:10:24.004
It's alright. It's alright.

01:10:24.061 --> 01:10:26.298
Yes. Yes.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.201
Smell that.

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:30.932
It's OK.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.668
Oh, please. No, it's not my fault!

01:10:40.127 --> 01:10:44.130
- It's not my fault!
- Whose fucking fault was it, Adam?!

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:50.368
Why did you kill my daughter?!

01:10:50.427 --> 01:10:53.371
- Why?!
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:10:53.427 --> 01:10:58.897
I saw them at the shopping center, and I
followed them home 'cause I wanted her.

01:10:59.294 --> 01:11:01.694
She was 9 years old!

01:11:02.261 --> 01:11:05.064
Look, please forgive me. I killed them.

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:07.667
I killed them all, alright?

01:11:08.827 --> 01:11:12.364
- Please.
- She was 9 years old.

01:11:14.594 --> 01:11:17.600
And Mary...

01:11:17.661 --> 01:11:21.628
you've taken her, too, mate, you know.

01:11:21.894 --> 01:11:23.997
They're both gone.

01:11:24.061 --> 01:11:26.834
You destroyed Mary.

01:11:27.094 --> 01:11:29.538
You killed us all.

01:11:32.094 --> 01:11:35.095
- I'm sorry.
- You killed us all.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.498
Please, forgive me, please.

01:11:38.561 --> 01:11:40.402
Please.

01:11:41.561 --> 01:11:42.867
Please?

01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:57.064
I'm so sorry.

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.203
I do forgive you, Adam.

01:12:17.862 --> 01:12:19.396
I forgive you.

01:12:26.495 --> 01:12:28.268
I forgive you.

01:12:29.327 --> 01:12:31.064
I forgive you.

01:12:37.828 --> 01:12:40.102
I could forgive you, Adam.

01:12:40.162 --> 01:12:42.197
Problem is...

01:12:42.261 --> 01:12:44.933
I don't believe a fucking word you just said.

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:49.802
Yeah, your stories... they don't work on me.

01:12:50.062 --> 01:12:52.938
Bullshit, Adam. I know the truth.

01:12:52.995 --> 01:12:54.098
I know you...

01:12:54.561 --> 01:12:56.638
Well, look at me.

01:12:57.494 --> 01:12:58.766
Fuck you.

01:12:58.828 --> 01:13:00.033
I went to prison.

01:13:00.295 --> 01:13:02.664
I did my time. I paid my debt.

01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:05.103
Paid your debt?

01:13:05.961 --> 01:13:08.038
Oh, no, not yet, you haven't.

01:13:08.096 --> 01:13:10.403
Yes, I fucking have.

01:13:12.262 --> 01:13:14.763
And I remember her...

01:13:15.628 --> 01:13:20.004
Your little princess... with the beautiful eyes.

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:22.865
I saw the light go out.

01:13:23.128 --> 01:13:27.697
Oh... I can still smell her. She smelled so sweet.

01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:32.233
She was one of my favorites.

01:13:32.295 --> 01:13:34.432
Ooh, she had the tight...

01:13:37.495 --> 01:13:38.938
Oh, yeah.

01:13:38.994 --> 01:13:40.368
Oh, my God.

01:13:40.828 --> 01:13:42.599
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:14:12.496 --> 01:14:14.098
<i>Fucking hell.</i>

01:14:17.429 --> 01:14:19.373
Who can blame him?

01:14:41.295 --> 01:14:44.432
Now! Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!

01:14:44.596 --> 01:14:46.340
Drop it now!

01:14:47.096 --> 01:14:49.334
John, listen to me. Drop that weapon, now!

01:14:49.395 --> 01:14:51.373
<i>Drop the weapon!</i>

01:14:53.896 --> 01:14:56.897
<i>Put it down! Put it down now!</i>

01:16:10.962 --> 01:16:16.359
<i>Early this morning, Australian vigilante serial
killer, John Doe, surrendered to police.</i>

01:16:16.363 --> 01:16:20.866
<i>He was taken into custody and
charged with 33 counts of murder.</i>

01:16:21.096 --> 01:16:24.370
<i>His final murder was broadcast
live over the Internet.</i>

01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:28.306
<i>The entire world will watch
this trial with great interest.</i>

01:16:31.563 --> 01:16:34.336
You offered Adam McCleish forgiveness.

01:16:34.396 --> 01:16:36.271
Yes, I did.

01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:37.774
- Did you mean it?
- No.

01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:40.535
Then why say it?

01:16:40.597 --> 01:16:43.541
Because I wanted him to
think it was a possibility...

01:16:43.597 --> 01:16:46.098
especially at the end.

01:16:46.164 --> 01:16:50.536
I wanted him to believe he had a chance
of making it out of that room alive.

01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:54.038
I wanted him to suffer.

01:16:54.097 --> 01:16:57.268
I wanted him to feel the pain
that only hope can bring.

01:16:59.897 --> 01:17:02.275
Is it in you to forgive?

01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:03.972
Of course.

01:17:04.429 --> 01:17:07.430
Not many people would believe that.

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:13.032
I forgave hundreds of people...
those that stopped...

01:17:13.097 --> 01:17:15.503
those that showed real, true remorse.

01:17:16.364 --> 01:17:20.496
Living with what they had done was
punishment enough. I left them off my list.

01:17:22.496 --> 01:17:24.667
Do you think you can be forgiven?

01:17:56.997 --> 01:17:59.236
Hi, Sally. I'm Ken.

01:17:59.297 --> 01:18:02.034
We spoke on the phone.

01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:07.004
I want to thank you for what you did...

01:18:07.464 --> 01:18:09.066
for Sally, here.

01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:13.030
She was too afraid to tell us what was happening.

01:18:13.097 --> 01:18:16.701
She didn't know what to do... or who to tell.

01:18:17.698 --> 01:18:22.164
God only knows what would have happened to her.

01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:24.038
Anyway, um...

01:18:24.297 --> 01:18:27.571
Sally has something she'd like to say to you.

01:18:32.698 --> 01:18:34.573
It's OK, Sally.

01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:38.601
Was it really you?

01:18:51.431 --> 01:18:53.375
Come on.

01:18:54.031 --> 01:18:56.409
Thank you.

01:18:59.965 --> 01:19:01.374
Thank you.

01:19:13.631 --> 01:19:16.337
Must have been excruciating for him.

01:19:16.598 --> 01:19:21.234
I think part of him wanted to... embrace
her, wanted to connect with her.

01:19:21.332 --> 01:19:25.571
But, in order to do that, to
let the wall down, well...

01:19:26.231 --> 01:19:28.775
I think it could have destroyed him.

01:19:28.831 --> 01:19:32.007
See, I see Sally as John Doe's redemption.

01:19:32.065 --> 01:19:34.433
It seems obvious that he saw her as...

01:19:34.498 --> 01:19:40.503
the daughter that he couldn't save, the
daughter he wanted to protect... but couldn't.

01:19:41.132 --> 01:19:45.899
And for Sally, well... for any child,
for that matter... it's very simple.

01:19:46.165 --> 01:19:50.132
He wants to hurt me, therefore he is a bad man.

01:19:50.198 --> 01:19:54.101
That man stopped the bad man from
hurting me, therefore he is a good man.

01:19:54.198 --> 01:19:56.540
Simple, black and white.

01:20:04.898 --> 01:20:07.967
We spent what, two grand, flying them up here?

01:20:08.032 --> 01:20:11.340
All we end up with is a shot of
him staring at his fucking cup.

01:20:13.832 --> 01:20:15.776
Don't you feel anything?

01:20:23.365 --> 01:20:29.269
You said, earlier, that for you... what
you did was all about the victims.

01:20:29.398 --> 01:20:32.731
But when it's all said and done, you
don't seem to care about them at all.

01:20:36.132 --> 01:20:37.906
Do you care about little Sally?

01:20:40.933 --> 01:20:43.240
It's not about the victims, is it, John?

01:20:44.799 --> 01:20:46.906
What is it about?

01:20:48.265 --> 01:20:49.937
Are the critics right...

01:20:49.999 --> 01:20:53.041
when they say that the real
reason you committed those crimes

01:20:53.066 --> 01:20:55.808
is because you actually enjoyed doing it?

01:20:56.465 --> 01:20:58.673
Are they right, John?

01:20:59.332 --> 01:21:02.435
Did you enjoy killing all those people?

01:21:06.365 --> 01:21:08.809
You did enjoy it, didn't you?

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.810
You took pleasure in it.

01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:16.811
You must have.

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:20.773
Now, listen, you...

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:23.810
I did you a favor.

01:21:23.866 --> 01:21:26.601
I did what needed doing.

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:31.701
There are so many of them out there,
and some of them never get caught.

01:21:32.199 --> 01:21:36.600
They just keep going... again and again and again.

01:21:36.832 --> 01:21:39.276
Then it must make you feel impotent, John...

01:21:39.333 --> 01:21:42.311
being locked in here knowing
that there are rapists

01:21:42.366 --> 01:21:45.401
and murderers and pedophiles roaming the streets,

01:21:45.466 --> 01:21:48.000
and now there is nothing you can do about it.

01:21:48.066 --> 01:21:51.908
Don't you worry. Their time will come.

01:21:51.966 --> 01:21:53.807
Really? How so?

01:21:56.133 --> 01:21:58.308
Because it's out there now.

01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:04.474
The public, they understand that
these people must be stopped.

01:22:04.533 --> 01:22:08.204
They get that the system that we call justice...

01:22:08.266 --> 01:22:12.301
is polluting humanity with its shades of gray.

01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:19.402
It's time to get up off the couch.

01:22:19.866 --> 01:22:23.811
It's time to turn off the television!

01:22:23.867 --> 01:22:27.276
It's time to stand up... and scream!

01:22:27.433 --> 01:22:31.434
It's not working! It's wrong!

01:22:36.466 --> 01:22:39.273
We all have to do something.

01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:43.776
We all have to take responsibility.
We have to make a difference.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:48.341
We have to stand up for each other.
We have to protect each other.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:56.244
I'm not fucking John Doe. We all are.

01:22:59.134 --> 01:23:00.842
You are.

01:23:02.299 --> 01:23:08.840
You have to make them stop,
and think... before they rape...

01:23:09.366 --> 01:23:14.708
before they maim, before they
kill, before they destroy lives!

01:23:14.867 --> 01:23:17.811
They have to believe...

01:23:17.867 --> 01:23:19.667
that someone is watching.

01:23:19.733 --> 01:23:24.067
They have to know that someone, out
there, is prepared to do anything...

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.837
is prepared to do whatever it takes.

01:23:32.034 --> 01:23:35.773
I've delivered the message.

01:23:36.033 --> 01:23:38.909
Now it's up to you.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.474
What are you doing?

01:23:46.033 --> 01:23:47.902
What is that?

01:23:47.967 --> 01:23:50.172
He's got something in his mouth.
There's something in his mouth.

01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:52.644
There's something in his mouth.

01:23:55.668 --> 01:23:56.844
Jesus!

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.708
Get over here and hold his fucking arms down!

01:24:00.767 --> 01:24:02.972
- What?
- Come on!

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.241
Hey! Send somebody in here!

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.471
Send somebody in here!

01:24:22.134 --> 01:24:25.010
This is why I chose you.

01:25:05.234 --> 01:25:08.307
<i>As further startling information comes to hand</i>

01:25:08.367 --> 01:25:11.470
<i>regarding Ken Rutherford's secret, sordid life,</i>

01:25:11.534 --> 01:25:16.276
<i>it is now obvious that he was always
a part of John Doe's master plan.</i>

01:25:20.568 --> 01:25:23.944
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

01:25:26.201 --> 01:25:27.803
Yes, we have, your honor.

01:25:28.467 --> 01:25:31.502
Would the defendant please rise?

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:42.544
On the 33 counts of murder, how do you find?

01:25:45.567 --> 01:25:48.175
We are now in a position to announce...

01:25:48.235 --> 01:25:51.872
that after many months of
trial and jury deliberation...

01:25:52.135 --> 01:25:55.136
we finally have our verdict.

01:27:05.235 --> 01:27:07.338
<i>All I have left...</i>

01:27:10.568 --> 01:27:14.012
<i>All I have left is... the hope...</i>

01:27:14.069 --> 01:27:16.842
<i>that there is more to this world...</i>

01:27:16.902 --> 01:27:19.073
<i>this life that we know...</i>

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:23.839
<i>and that one day, somewhere else, someplace else.</i>

01:27:24.969 --> 01:27:28.345
<i>One day, I'll be able to hold her again...</i>

01:27:29.602 --> 01:27:32.739
<i>and look into... her beautiful eyes...</i>

01:27:34.902 --> 01:27:38.778
<i>and tell her how much I love her.</i>

01:29:21.237 --> 01:29:24.215
Do you know me?

01:29:26.137 --> 01:29:28.342
I'm John Doe.
