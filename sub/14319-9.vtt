And that's when
he called out to me.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.375
XAVIER: Mutant.

16:30.375 --> 16:31.708
Mutant.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.750
I feel your pain.
Let me help you.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.708
In order for you to heal,
you must forget.

16:47.708 --> 16:49.208
I can't!

16:49.208 --> 16:51.416
What's gonna happen
to Ms. Marvel?

16:51.416 --> 16:55.375
I'm sorry, Rogue,
but I cannot return her
to her real body.

16:55.375 --> 16:59.375
For now I can only quiet her,
for both your sakes.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
That is how I lost you
to Xavier.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.875
I swore one day
I'd get you back.

17:05.875 --> 17:08.833
Today is that day,
my daughter.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.583
You used me!

17:10.583 --> 17:13.583
I was just a weapon for you
against Ms. Marvel!

17:14.250 --> 17:16.250
What's happening to me?

17:16.250 --> 17:18.500
You still have
my shape-shifting power.

17:18.500 --> 17:22.000
It will fade soon,
but you can't control it.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm taking over
this mind and this body.

17:26.875 --> 17:30.458
Finally,
Ms. Marvel is reborn!

17:30.458 --> 17:32.000
Where's Rogue?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Chere!

17:33.000 --> 17:35.250
Somebody make her stop!

17:35.250 --> 17:36.958
MYSTIQUE:
No! Fight her!

17:39.125 --> 17:40.875
Storm!

17:40.875 --> 17:43.000
STORM:
They will not get away!

17:45.958 --> 17:48.625
Cyclops,
I cannot catch them!

17:48.625 --> 17:50.333
JEAN: (TELEPATHIC)
Don't worry, Storm.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.333
I am monitoring all of you
through Cerebro.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.583
You can't catch up
with her body,

17:56.583 --> 18:01.000
but, with Cerebro's help,
I can catch up with her mind.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.208
Rogue, let me
inside your mind.

18:05.208 --> 18:08.250
Rogue, where are you?

18:08.250 --> 18:11.250
Go away!
You have no business here!

18:11.875 --> 18:13.875
Let go of her!

18:13.875 --> 18:16.875
MS. MARVEL: I've been waiting
a long time for this, sister!

18:22.000 --> 18:24.500
This is only happening
in my mind.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.458
MS. MARVEL:
That's exactly
why it's real.

18:27.458 --> 18:32.291
When I defeat you here,
your mind and body
will be mine.

18:35.708 --> 18:41.250
You don't understand.
If you destroy her,
you're both finished.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.333
Better to have it
end like this!

18:46.458 --> 18:50.625
You took away
everything I had,
everything I ever was!

18:50.625 --> 18:53.750
ROGUE: I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to do it.

18:54.208 --> 18:57.375
Sorry doesn't give me
back my life!

18:57.375 --> 18:59.458
This ends now!

18:59.458 --> 19:00.500
No!

19:01.208 --> 19:04.125
(SCREAMING) No!

19:07.458 --> 19:08.583
(GRUNTING)

19:10.458 --> 19:14.500
(SOBBING) I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

19:17.875 --> 19:19.958
JEAN: She left you no choice.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.125
(GASPS)

19:22.125 --> 19:24.875
JEAN: (TELEPATHIC)
Jean to Cyclops. It's over.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.875
Rogue's OK.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.166
What are you doing?

19:29.166 --> 19:30.708
Sorry, Mystique.

19:30.708 --> 19:33.083
Use your pitiful tricks
on somebody else.

19:33.083 --> 19:35.000
I belong with the X-Men now.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.250
Xavier's gone.
Only I can help you.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.708
Only I could
ever help you.

19:40.708 --> 19:42.708
You never loved me.

19:42.708 --> 19:44.833
You only cared
about my powers.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.833
You made me worse
than a killer!

19:46.833 --> 19:48.958
How can you
do this to me?

19:48.958 --> 19:51.583
I raised you like my own.

19:51.583 --> 19:55.875
I ain't your daughter, Mystique.
Not anymore.

20:03.166 --> 20:04.875
(WHISTLES)

20:04.875 --> 20:08.166
Well, look at this.
I hope you dress up for me.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.375
I'd like to
sometime, Gambit.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.833
But I'm spending today
with an old friend.

20:22.250 --> 20:26.250
A visitor?
You know our Jane Doe?

20:26.250 --> 20:30.458
Her name is Carol Danvers.
We were very close.

20:53.125 --> 20:57.166
