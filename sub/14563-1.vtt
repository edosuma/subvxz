WEBVTT

00:06.590 --> 00:08.300
<i>It's a dream come true.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:12.054
<i>You've been trying to get</i>
<i>this movie made for 20 years.</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:15.891
<i>Did you ever think you'd be sitting here,</i>
<i>talking about</i> Secretariat?

00:15.974 --> 00:17.935
Sitting here? In this hotel room?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.356
It's a dream come true.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.358
What's it like to play Secretariat?

00:24.441 --> 00:25.442
Dream come true.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.195
Playing Secretariat, what was that like?

00:28.278 --> 00:29.238
Dream come true.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.281
<i>How long you in New York for?</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.116
Just a couple days of fun interviews,

00:33.200 --> 00:35.494
then it's off to Chicago
for more fun interviews,

00:35.577 --> 00:38.997
and then, if I don't blow my brains out,
I get to go back to L.A.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.917
Darling, you're doing marvelously,
I am so proud of you.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.002
If I could make one slight adjustment?

00:44.086 --> 00:45.963
Maybe fewer jokes
about how these interviews

00:46.046 --> 00:48.173
- make you want to blow your brains out?
- Right. Sorry.

00:48.674 --> 00:51.343
I am so thrilled to be here,
talking with, uh...

00:51.426 --> 00:53.595
-Yahoo Finland.
-Yahoo Finland.

00:53.679 --> 00:56.598
- Are you Finnish?
- No, we are just getting started.

00:56.682 --> 00:57.891
Walked right into that one.

00:57.975 --> 01:02.354
What would an Oscar nomination
mean for Mr. BoJack Horseman?

01:02.437 --> 01:04.439
Any award recognition is just gravy.

01:04.523 --> 01:06.775
The real joy is to sit
in this hotel room all day,

01:06.858 --> 01:08.860
answering the same questions
over and over again.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.530
Great answers, you're divine.
I'm in love with you.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.658
One small adjustment.
I don't think sarcasm is going to read.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.536
Just write a script for me,
so I don't have to think for myself.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.788
Honey, I would shove my hand
up your ass

01:19.871 --> 01:22.791
and control your mouth like a Muppet
if it would win you an Oscar.

01:22.874 --> 01:23.750
What do I know?

01:23.834 --> 01:26.795
I'm just the publicist you hired
to help win you an Oscar.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.339
<i>What's it like to play Seabiscuit?</i>

01:29.423 --> 01:31.466
I don't know.
You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.

01:31.550 --> 01:34.094
Your last attempt at a comeback
was <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

01:34.177 --> 01:35.137
Pass.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.598
People still see you as the guy
from that sucky show from the '90s.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.475
<i>Horsin' Around </i>was not a sucky show.

01:40.559 --> 01:43.854
- Yeah, but it was.
- It lasted nine seasons.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.814
Its whole purpose
was for people to watch it

01:45.897 --> 01:47.357
so the network could sell ad time,

01:47.441 --> 01:49.610
so the show could make more money
than it cost to produce.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.737
It did that well. It was a good show.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.615
- Yes, but it sucked.
- It didn't suck!

01:56.074 --> 01:58.201
Great job today.
It could not have gone better.

01:58.285 --> 02:01.538
My only note would be
stop defending <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

02:01.622 --> 02:03.123
Why? Millions of people loved it!

02:03.206 --> 02:06.668
We need to use these next few months
to define your story.

02:06.752 --> 02:10.255
When people see you
they need to think Oscar winner,

02:10.339 --> 02:13.258
not dumb asshole from an old TV show
that nobody cares about.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.718
Okay, I hear what you're saying,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.346
but we can both agree <i>Horsin' Around</i>
was a good show, right?

02:17.429 --> 02:19.222
BoJack, you know
I think the world of you.

02:19.306 --> 02:23.060
I think you are so smart and attractive,
so I'm not going to mince words.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.438
<i>Horsin' Around </i>was a piece of shit.

02:28.607 --> 02:35.322
<i>♪ ♪ </i>

03:22.953 --> 03:26.373
Looking good. Fantastic.
You need a coaster.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.917
I told you to wear lipstick
and underpants, Teresa.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.877
I put everything bill-related
in one folder.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.422
Gas bill, cable bill,
and the new headshots for Billy Zane.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.549
- Thank you, Judah.
- You also wanted me to remind you

03:35.632 --> 03:36.967
- to call Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Yeah.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.094
Ping me again in two minutes?
No, five minutes.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.971
Uh, when's our call
with BoJack and Spanakopita?

03:41.054 --> 03:43.807
The one that started seven minutes ago?
It started seven minutes ago.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.725
What?

03:44.808 --> 03:47.310
Diane's in your office right now,
stalling... poorly.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.939
And that is my opinion on the Octomom.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.524
Remember Octomom?

03:52.607 --> 03:55.277
<i>Diane, are you stalling</i>
<i>for Princess Carolyn?</i>

03:55.360 --> 03:57.612
What? You know who was good at stallin'

03:57.696 --> 04:00.240
was Joseph Stalin.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.868
<i>If anything,</i>
<i>Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.</i>

04:02.951 --> 04:04.369
<i>Get your head out of your ass.</i>

04:04.453 --> 04:09.166
He also had a city named after him.
Isn't that right, Princess Carolyn,

04:09.249 --> 04:11.626
- who's been here the whole time?
- Hey, buddy.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.712
How was your first big day
at the press junket?

04:13.795 --> 04:17.090
Endless. It was like
the second act of a Judd Apatow movie.

04:17.174 --> 04:18.759
He was exquisite.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.886
The movie's tracking really well
on social.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.764
New media impressions are up
23 percent across platforms.

04:23.847 --> 04:24.931
What does that mean?

04:25.015 --> 04:27.392
Oh, I have no idea.
I assumed you would know.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.229
But I keep tweeting things
and they keep getting retweeted,

04:31.313 --> 04:32.689
so we're doing something right.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.691
Yesterday I dropped my phone
in the bathroom

04:34.775 --> 04:37.110
which made BoJack's Instagram
post a picture of the floor,

04:37.194 --> 04:39.780
with the caption "<i>spujb."</i>
That got 4000 likes.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.490
- <i>Great.</i>
- I am exhausted.

04:41.573 --> 04:44.159
Being a movie star is the hardest job.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.661
And we get no recognition.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.121
Okay, you're gonna love this.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.958
I pulled some strings at <i>Manatee Fair</i>
and set up an interview tomorrow night.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.461
BoJack is not ready
for a magazine feature.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.505
Relax. It's not that big a deal.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.341
I didn't realize
you were an authority on deal size.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.342
<i>Listen, Moussaka...</i>

05:00.425 --> 05:04.221
Ladies, please.
There's plenty of BoJack to go around.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.182
I can do all the bullshit things
Ana's scheduled for me in the morning

05:07.265 --> 05:10.685
and still have time for Princess Carolyn's
bullshit thing tomorrow night.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.270
Now, pajamas.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.271
Whaa!

05:13.355 --> 05:15.440
- Todd?!
- <i>What is going on over there?</i>

05:15.524 --> 05:17.484
<i>BoJack smuggled</i>
<i>a young boy into his room.</i>

05:17.567 --> 05:20.070
No big deal.
Movie stars do it all the time.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.780
Where am I?

05:21.863 --> 05:23.657
Bagels? Pizza?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.117
Hipsters? Urine?

05:26.201 --> 05:29.371
- Am I in Minneapolis?
- What? No, you're in New York.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.164
Follow-up: why are you in New York?

05:31.248 --> 05:34.167
Beats me. Sometimes I just am places.

05:34.251 --> 05:37.837
I can't get to sleep. Oh, God.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.467
Yeah, that'll do it.

05:44.886 --> 05:49.724
Is my name Sarah Koenig?
Because I'm about to get cereal.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.562
I am the queen.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.397
Follow me, citizens.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.942
There are no sad times
in our cave of possibilities.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.286
Huh.

06:09.369 --> 06:13.164
Small bottle of shampoo?!
Not on my watch!

06:15.959 --> 06:17.752
You better not have gotten
your failure stink

06:17.836 --> 06:19.838
all over my important movie star clothes.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.631
- Ohh...
- I didn't mean that.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.800
You're my friend
and you don't stink of failure.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.178
Your stink is one of good intentions
and youthful exuberance.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.014
<i>Hooray, compliment!</i>

06:29.598 --> 06:31.683
You wanted me to ping you
regarding Mr. Peanutbutter.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.519
Oh, fish! Guys, hold on,
I have to make a quick call.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.396
- What? You're already on a call.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

06:36.479 --> 06:38.106
- Please hold.
<i>- This is ridiculous.</i>

06:38.940 --> 06:40.859
- Hello?
<i>- It's your agent!</i>

06:40.942 --> 06:43.194
I wanted to remind you
of your meeting with Pinky today.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.863
I think I'm already in it.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.743
- Do I need to be on this call still?
- I put you on conference. How do I...?

06:49.826 --> 06:53.663
- BoJack Horseman, is that you?!
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.375
Hey buddy, loved that bathroom floor pic
you posted yesterday.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.711
<i>Spujb! </i>Classic BoJack.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.297
<i>We should get together sometime</i>
<i>and take a selfie.</i>

07:02.380 --> 07:06.551
I'd love to, buddy,
but I'm kinda in New York right now.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.429
<i>New York City?!</i>
<i>They make such great salsa.</i>

07:09.512 --> 07:12.098
I'm here too, honey.
Have a great meeting!

07:12.182 --> 07:14.434
Diane?! Wait, you went to New York?

07:14.517 --> 07:16.227
- <i>No. I'm just on--</i>
- Why wouldn't you tell me?

07:16.311 --> 07:17.687
How long are you-- I'm not accusing.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.983
<i>I just... I feel safer when I know</i>
<i>that I know where you are.</i>

07:22.067 --> 07:23.985
- I affirm your feelings...
<i>- I don't want to--</i>

07:24.069 --> 07:25.528
...your feelings have value,

07:25.612 --> 07:28.073
but I'm not in New York,
I'm just on the conference call.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.158
- Guys, can we...
<i>-  I feel heard.</i>

07:30.241 --> 07:32.869
- <i>I hear that you feel heard.</i>
- What the hell is happening?

07:32.953 --> 07:36.122
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm in New York!
- <i>What?!</i>

07:36.206 --> 07:39.417
<i>As Carrie from</i>
Sex and the City <i>might say...</i>

07:39.501 --> 07:42.796
<i>- I'm Carrie.</i>
<i>- Todd? In the naked city?</i>

07:42.879 --> 07:47.467
<i>That is going to lead</i>
<i>to some wackiness. You mark my words.</i>

07:47.550 --> 07:51.429
Would you guys literally mark my words?
I do want to refer back to this later on.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.390
We're in the middle of a meeting!

07:53.473 --> 07:56.184
G<i>ot to go.</i>
<i>It's always "Rabbit, Run" with this guy.</i>

07:56.267 --> 07:57.268
Right?

07:57.352 --> 08:00.939
Oh, yeah. Somebody did their research
on J.D. Salinger.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.023
<i>Rabbit, Run?</i>

08:02.107 --> 08:04.818
- <i>That's Updike, you illiterate.</i>
- What's Updike?

08:04.901 --> 08:06.861
Not much, dyke, what's up with you?

08:06.945 --> 08:08.571
Is "dyke" an okay thing to say now?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.949
<i>Has it been reclaimed?</i>
<i>I honestly can't keep track.</i>

08:11.783 --> 08:14.577
- Who are you asking?
<i>- We're hanging up now, goodbye.</i>

08:14.661 --> 08:18.123
Wow! BoJack and Todd in the Big Apple.

08:18.206 --> 08:22.210
I want to find one of those fortune
telling robots that can make me big!

08:23.211 --> 08:26.673
Hey, champ,
I have a very important job for you.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.591
Why don't you go get us some ice?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.301
You don't need to patronize me.

08:30.385 --> 08:34.556
- But, yeah, I can do that important job.
- Don't get lost, buddy!

08:34.639 --> 08:35.682
I'm not gonna get lost.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.393
The city's on a grid, why would I get...

08:44.232 --> 08:45.191
Oh, no.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.777
Hello? Are you still there?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.905
- They may have hung up.
- I have some good news for once.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.658
I just got promoted
to head of programming.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.911
I'm no longer a passenger
on the burning wreckage of an industry

08:56.995 --> 08:59.164
that is broadcast television.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.499
- I'm a captain!
- What happened to Wanda?

09:01.583 --> 09:03.626
You didn't hear? She got poached.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.754
- Oh, God!
- By another company.

09:05.837 --> 09:06.755
Oh, good.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.506
- They shot her.
- Oh, God!

09:08.590 --> 09:10.675
Straight to the top
of the corporate ladder!

09:10.759 --> 09:14.054
- Oh, good.
- She had to move to Detroit.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.474
- Oh, God!
- Which I hear is due for a resurgence.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.601
Can we get to the goddamn point, please?

09:19.684 --> 09:22.020
Anyway, the network
is finally breaking even,

09:22.103 --> 09:25.023
thanks to the runaway success
of <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

09:25.106 --> 09:27.484
<i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!</i>

09:27.567 --> 09:30.737
Not to mention its companion show
<i>Talking Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

09:30.820 --> 09:32.322
<i>What Do They Know?</i>
<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out,</i>

09:32.405 --> 09:33.281
<i>With Chris Hardwick.</i>

09:33.364 --> 09:36.534
- So as long as you two stick around...
- I'm taking the show off the air.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.495
Wait, what? Why?!

09:38.578 --> 09:40.538
I told the story I wanted to tell.

09:40.622 --> 09:43.875
To prolong it for commercial reasons
would be crass and inorganic.

09:43.958 --> 09:44.793
Uh...

09:44.876 --> 09:48.671
At long last the public knows
what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

09:48.755 --> 09:50.048
and what they don't know.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.716
Did they know things?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.676
- Well, we found out.
- This is a nightmare.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.137
Why does everything I love fall apart
as soon as I touch it?

09:56.221 --> 09:58.348
Oh, my ex-wife was right about me.

09:58.431 --> 10:02.143
I <i>am </i>no Christopher
from the Tesla dealership.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.526
Is this as good as it gets?

10:09.609 --> 10:14.781
Or are we living in the ghost town
where once my career did blossom?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.159
Who will speak my name
when I am gone?

10:18.243 --> 10:22.747
Who will sing lamentations
for he who once talked soup?

10:22.831 --> 10:26.668
What legacy of ruin am I left with?

10:26.751 --> 10:30.630
What rewards have I reaped
for the damage done?

10:31.422 --> 10:33.925
I do not miss the spotlight's glare,

10:34.008 --> 10:38.096
but I do... a little, miss sunshine.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.687
But before you fold the omelette,

10:45.770 --> 10:49.607
I'd like the chef to hold the pan up
and whisper his or her dreams into it.

10:49.691 --> 10:53.069
Whisper dreams into omelette.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.572
Just coffee.
Don't need to talk to it at all. Thanks.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.241
You look different. Older. A lot older.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.202
I'm not saying you look bad,
just much, much, much older.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.245
Thank you, Jill.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.581
You haven't heard from Cuddlywhiskers
recently, have you?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.458
Cuddlywhiskers? I haven't talked
to him since the show was canceled.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.793
I worry about him.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.296
About six months back, he disappeared,

11:11.379 --> 11:12.589
stopped returning my calls.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.593
I'm sure he's fine.
I mean, who returns calls?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.928
Promise me you'll check on him
when you get back to L.A.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.681
Maybe swing by his house?
I think you owe him that much.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.641
Fine. Listen, about the play...

11:23.725 --> 11:26.311
<i>The Tragedy of Greg KingLear,</i>
a theatrical immersion by Jill Pill?

11:26.394 --> 11:28.354
- Right.
- That's dead. Over.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.273
A thing that happened
that happens no longer,

11:30.356 --> 11:31.691
- like a whimper in the wind.
- Okay.

11:31.774 --> 11:36.779
Theater is by its very nature ephemeral.
We shout into the void, "Hey, you!"

11:36.863 --> 11:39.782
And the void says,
"Stop shouting at me, please!"

11:39.866 --> 11:43.536
And we grab the void and we spit
in its face, "Sir, I will not."

11:43.620 --> 11:45.413
Boy, did New York do a number on you.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.583
Let me tell you about my next piece.
It starts with you,

11:48.666 --> 11:52.003
BoJack Horseman,
completely naked and covered in milk.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.047
- I'll stop you there.
- It's a symbol for rebirth.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.007
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.468
I'm still recovering
from being birthed the first time.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.012
Jill, I'm not the guy who does things
that are challenging,

12:01.095 --> 12:03.097
or edgy, or covered in milk.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.768
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.
I'm thinking about my legacy now.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.146
I want to do things that connect
with people, things that last.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.273
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.275
No, I know, but see, years after I die,

12:14.359 --> 12:16.694
people will still be able
to see me in <i>Secretariat.</i>

12:16.778 --> 12:18.446
- And then what?
- And then...

12:19.072 --> 12:22.200
I'll be remembered.
If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.244
- And then what?
- Then my life will have meaning.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.413
- I don't know!
- Mm-hmm.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.499
You know what the real tragedy
of <i>Greg KingLear </i>is?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.167
Two hours long without an intermission?

12:31.250 --> 12:32.627
It's that he's a marionette.

12:32.710 --> 12:36.089
And he doesn't even know someone else
is pulling his strings.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.008
Mmm, I don't think the chef
whispered his dreams into this.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.468
This does not taste like dreams.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.557
You told me I would be getting
more attention at a smaller agency,

12:46.641 --> 12:48.601
but if anything, I'm getting less.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.145
Is this the best time to be on your phone?

12:51.229 --> 12:53.815
I'm sorry.
Let me just send this one email...

12:53.898 --> 12:56.192
What? Why isn't it sending? Judah!

12:56.275 --> 12:58.403
I'm taking my business
to Gekko Rabitowitz.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.862
What? No!

12:59.946 --> 13:04.033
J.D. Salinger is too big a star to be
hamstrung by some rinky-dink operation

13:04.117 --> 13:05.952
working out of a two-story warehouse.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.538
I need an agency
with at least nine stories.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.580
Uh...

13:09.664 --> 13:13.876
That was a reference to my work,
with which you are clearly not familiar.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.211
- Oh...
- Goodbye.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.672
Hello to you, Rasputin.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.466
- Give my regards to the czar.
- I will relay the message.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.469
Oh, I don't know why
I thought I could do this.

13:23.553 --> 13:27.056
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.809
I believe I can take on
more responsibility around here.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.478
- On a provisional basis, of course.
- Okay.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.732
But we're a small agency
and we need to think like one.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.358
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner,

13:37.442 --> 13:40.319
we should focus on better gigs
for the clients we already have.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.698
- Oh. Like <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>
<i>- </i>Yes.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.326
- What part of <i>Jerry Maguire</i>?
- The part where Tom Cruise's agent

13:47.410 --> 13:50.455
got him a massive payday
for being in <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

13:50.538 --> 13:53.583
<i>♪ Who's that dog?</i>
<i>Mister Peanutbutter ♪</i>

13:53.666 --> 13:54.917
Princess Carolyn?!

13:55.001 --> 13:57.754
Listen, kid, tough break about
the <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities</i>

13:57.837 --> 14:00.631
<i>Whatever, Whatever, Whatever,</i>
but what are we gonna do next?

14:00.715 --> 14:03.217
I was looking forward
to taking some time off.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.179
What?
That is the worst idea I've ever heard.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.014
You're the biggest name in TV right now.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.516
<i>and every network would love to air</i>
<i>your next project.</i>

14:10.600 --> 14:13.019
Why don't you get off your lazy keister

14:13.102 --> 14:16.189
and come up with some TV ideas
and make us all billionaires?

14:16.272 --> 14:17.398
Go get us some money.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.318
<i>Go get it, boy. You can do it!</i>
<i>Go! Atta boy!</i>

14:24.322 --> 14:27.116
Daddy, it's so nice having you home.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.535
These last few months have been amazing.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.038
My blood pressure's down,
my stress is down.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.040
Oh, what the...?

14:34.665 --> 14:37.085
There's my favorite accountant!

14:37.168 --> 14:39.545
Great news! P.B. Livin' is back...

14:39.629 --> 14:41.005
- No! No!
- ...in business!

14:41.089 --> 14:43.049
- No!
- Yes!

14:43.633 --> 14:45.176
-Here we go!
-Oh, God, no, please.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.388
It's gonna be great, as it always is,
from my perspective.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.723
Dad, you promised
we were gonna play catch,

14:50.807 --> 14:53.768
and then we'd listen to your favorite
Harry Chapin song together!

14:53.851 --> 14:55.395
You never told me what it was!

14:55.478 --> 14:57.730
Oh, it's <i>Cat's in the Cradle</i>,
but don't listen to it now!

14:57.814 --> 14:59.232
I'm gonna go listen to it.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.526
No! The lyrics are too relevant.
Don't do it.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.945
No!

15:08.783 --> 15:11.619
So, what's next for BoJack?

15:11.702 --> 15:15.456
What do you mean, "What's next?"
Why does everything have to have a next?

15:15.540 --> 15:19.544
I just mean, after <i>Secretariat's</i> all over,
what are you going to do next?

15:19.627 --> 15:23.923
We were told this feature would be
pegged to the release of <i>Secretariat.</i>

15:24.006 --> 15:27.427
It is, but we also want to get to know
the real BoJack.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.095
- Do we?
- If you want the real BoJack,

15:29.178 --> 15:30.680
there's a book written about that.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.891
But that was BoJack
before the book came out.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.476
Who's BoJack now?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.812
Who's BoJack now? BoJack is just...

15:37.895 --> 15:40.231
He's a guy who could use a drink,
that's who!

15:40.314 --> 15:41.441
Should we order alcohol?

15:41.524 --> 15:44.277
Heather, could we have
a moment of privacy, please?

15:44.360 --> 15:47.363
Sure. I'll just plug my ears
and sing an old sea shanty.

15:47.447 --> 15:51.951
<i>♪ Oh, the sea she be a salty lass</i>
<i>With a hi, ho, barrel of rum... ♪</i>

15:52.034 --> 15:54.745
Sweetheart, I don't think
we need to be drinking tonight.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.123
Trust me, you do not want me
to do this sober.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.293
You don't need to micromanage
everything, okay? I'm not your puppet.

16:00.710 --> 16:04.005
All right.
You clearly have everything under control.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.717
<i>♪ Raise the mast and raise your glass</i>
<i>And banish ye dragons ♪</i>

16:07.800 --> 16:09.343
<i>♪ To where they come from! ♪</i>

16:09.427 --> 16:11.554
<i>Garçon, dos </i>whiskey sours, <i>por favor?</i>

16:11.637 --> 16:14.056
Actually, make it <i>tres.</i>
And whatever the lady wants.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.851
- Did mama bear finally leave?
- She's a human, but yes.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.644
Well, when the cat's away...

16:18.728 --> 16:20.730
Again, a human.
I like where you're going with this.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.940
I gotta tell you,
I really loved the movie.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.984
You're definitely going to win an Oscar.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.070
That "You Are Secretariat" scene?
Oh, it made me wet.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.322
It made you wet?!

16:29.405 --> 16:31.532
Yeah. "Wet" is manatee slang.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.910
It refers to a feeling
of comfort and warmth,

16:33.993 --> 16:36.704
because a manatee's
natural habitat is water.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.039
Oh, okay.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.041
- It also made me really horny.
- Uh...

16:40.124 --> 16:41.417
That's narwhal slang.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.169
You know, because they have horns.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.888
<i>When I first came to New York</i>
<i>I was young, full of hope.</i>

16:53.971 --> 16:55.890
<i>But you get lost in this town.</i>

16:55.973 --> 16:58.684
<i>One day you look in the mirror</i>
<i>and think to yourself,</i>

16:58.768 --> 17:01.187
"Who is this sad, broken man?"

17:01.270 --> 17:03.356
Listen, kid, I don't need your life story.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.191
I just came out here to commit suicide.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.610
- No, don't!
- Crap! Forgot I could fly.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.244
The first thing you notice about BoJack
is he's got a nice buzz going.

17:16.327 --> 17:19.330
Oh, one final question.
Are you more man than horse?

17:19.413 --> 17:21.082
Or are you more horse than man?

17:21.165 --> 17:22.375
What the hell does that mean?

17:22.458 --> 17:25.169
Take off your city clothes
and let's be animals!

17:25.253 --> 17:27.255
I want to get natural!

17:28.839 --> 17:31.634
Okay! A manatee and a horse
making out with each other.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.969
Just like in nature.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.847
In the old days sailors thought
manatees were mermaids.

17:36.931 --> 17:40.184
Remember that episode of <i>Horsin' Around</i>
where Sabrina wanted to be a mermaid?

17:40.268 --> 17:42.019
I don't want to think about that show.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.854
I didn't come back to your hotel room

17:43.938 --> 17:47.984
because you're a goofy dad who once got
his dick stuck in a vacuum cleaner.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.611
I'm pretty sure
that never happened on the show.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.322
If I'm going to sacrifice
my journalistic integrity,

17:53.406 --> 17:56.617
it's because I'm having sex
with a movie star.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.535
And they're off!

17:59.996 --> 18:01.706
- You like that, little horsie?
- Yeah.

18:01.789 --> 18:05.418
- But I don't need you to talk.
- I'm a mermaid, baby.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.379
- Gonna climb up onto your boat.
- What?

18:10.047 --> 18:13.467
- What happened?
- Sorry, I just... Give me a minute.

18:13.551 --> 18:17.263
You want me to touch it,
blow on it, sing it happy birthday?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.723
No, no, just...

18:18.806 --> 18:20.725
Why did you say
that thing about the boat?

18:20.808 --> 18:23.477
I don't know, I was being sexy.
You okay?

18:23.561 --> 18:25.813
Just forget it. You ruined it.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.612
You want to talk about it?

18:32.695 --> 18:36.657
There's nothing to talk about.
It was a misunderstanding, that's all.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.328
She just walked in
at the worst possible...

18:40.411 --> 18:43.080
It-- It wasn't my fault, uh, right?

18:43.164 --> 18:45.207
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.127
On the boat, there was a girl.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.129
- What?
- In New Mexico.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.506
And she trusted me.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.552
I keep asking myself
if her mother didn't walk in,

18:56.636 --> 18:57.887
would I have done it?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.556
And part of me is sure
that I-- I couldn't.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.101
But another part knows that's a lie.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.438
How do you make something right
when you've made it so wrong

19:07.521 --> 19:08.898
you can never go back?

19:08.981 --> 19:12.234
I just think
you have to keep moving forward?

19:12.318 --> 19:13.361
Yeah.

19:13.444 --> 19:16.656
All my life that's all I've ever done.
What's it gotten me?

19:16.739 --> 19:19.492
Well, hey, look,
you're the star of a movie now.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.285
You're probably gonna win an Oscar.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.287
I'm not even in it. That's not me.

19:23.371 --> 19:26.874
- What do you mean, that's not you?
- I was digitally replaced.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.543
Special effects. None of it's me.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.046
Wow, that's...

19:32.129 --> 19:33.798
That's quite a story.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.591
I shouldn't even be here.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.301
It's been a long night.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.430
Why don't we go to bed?
In the morning, everything will be okay.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.696
Oh, shit.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.410
BoJack?

20:02.493 --> 20:04.620
It's 4:00 am.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.623
No, it's 7:00. I'm in New York.
I'm calling from the future.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.876
Is that BoJack Horseman?
What is this, a crossover episode?

20:10.960 --> 20:11.919
What do you want?

20:12.002 --> 20:15.923
Let's say, hypothetically,
you had some information about me.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.383
You were gonna write about it,

20:17.466 --> 20:20.052
<i>I wanted to stop you</i>
<i>before you could get it published.</i>

20:20.136 --> 20:22.847
What would be a smart thing
I could do in that situation

20:22.930 --> 20:24.265
that would change your mind?

20:24.348 --> 20:26.058
Are we fighting about the book again?

20:26.142 --> 20:28.269
I don't remember
where we left off last time.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.354
No. Diane, not everything is about you.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.773
<i>For once, I have a problem,</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

20:32.857 --> 20:34.900
Okay, walk me through it again?

20:34.984 --> 20:37.486
I don't have time!
It's already three hours later here!

20:37.570 --> 20:40.322
Thanks a lot. Once again,
you've been no help whatsoever.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.200
Spoiler from the future, you suck.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.662
<i>Sorry, you don't suck. I'm just...</i>
<i>very stressed out right now. Bye.</i>

20:47.705 --> 20:49.874
Oh, come on, come on.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.335
I'm aware of the situation
and I'm handling it.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.755
- But I haven't even--
- I'm handling it.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.631
I'll see you at the screening tonight.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.008
- But...
- Don't be late.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.010
- BoJack!
- Huh?

21:01.093 --> 21:02.970
There you are. Stay right there.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.181
You will not <i>believe </i>the night I had.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.309
- This city will eat you alive.
- Did you get the ice?

21:10.019 --> 21:11.562
I'll be right back.

21:14.648 --> 21:15.775
I'm lost again!

21:17.735 --> 21:18.819
<i>All right, Oxnard.</i>

21:18.903 --> 21:21.906
We are looking at
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.033
Too bad Todd's not here.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.076
He's always the best
at coming up with ideas

21:26.160 --> 21:28.245
that at first might seem terrible...

21:29.330 --> 21:30.581
Right.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.042
If he was here,
he'd probably say something like,

21:33.125 --> 21:35.836
"Hey, you know what's cool?
Spaghetti strainers!"

21:35.920 --> 21:37.129
Go on.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.382
And you'd say, "I feel like
I've seen that somewhere before."

21:40.466 --> 21:42.551
Hah! That is so me!

21:42.635 --> 21:45.221
And then he'd say, "What if I told you

21:45.304 --> 21:48.641
that this spaghetti strainer
is also a hat?"

21:48.724 --> 21:52.228
A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.021
That is a brilliant idea!

21:54.104 --> 21:56.148
That's a terrible idea.
That's my point!

21:56.232 --> 21:57.775
Put that in the maybe pile.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.819
Right now, we need to focus
on TV shows.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.570
I'm sure Todd would suggest,

22:01.654 --> 22:05.449
<i>A Spaghetti Strainer</i>
<i>That's Also A Hat: The TV Show.</i>

22:05.533 --> 22:07.868
That's it! Todd, you've done it again.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.578
No! Nobody's done anything.

22:09.662 --> 22:13.040
Oxnard, I want you to buy out
the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.292
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.212
I'm putting all my money
in spaghetti strainers for this show.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.423
- How is this a show?
- Don't ask me. It's your idea.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.558
I took care of our problem.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.142
What did you do?

22:32.226 --> 22:35.771
You don't need to know anything else.
It's been taken care of.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.231
Ana...

22:37.314 --> 22:39.775
There-- There was a moment
back at the hotel where...

22:40.442 --> 22:43.696
I really thought I blew it,
I was scared it was all over, and--

22:43.779 --> 22:46.574
And then after, I was relieved.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.493
I don't know if I should win an Oscar.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.413
- I don't know if I want to.
- Stop punishing yourself.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.164
I was in New Mexico.

22:54.248 --> 22:58.127
None of that matters.
All that matters now is the story.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.212
We get to decide what our story is.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.299
Nobody else gets to tell you
what your story is.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.342
- What is my story?
- I'll tell you.

23:05.426 --> 23:09.263
This has been your dream for the last
30 years. You made it happen.

23:09.346 --> 23:13.517
An Oscar won't make you happy forever,
it won't solve all your problems.

23:13.601 --> 23:17.313
You win that Oscar,
the next day you go back to being you.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.566
But that night is a really good night.

23:20.649 --> 23:25.404
I think you deserve a really good night,
and I know how to get you there.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.364
Do you want that?

23:28.282 --> 23:29.950
Yes, I do.

23:30.034 --> 23:33.329
Go introduce your movie. Tell your story.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.831
Tomorrow we fly to Chicago.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.503
<i>Being Secretariat</i>
<i>isn't just about running fast.</i>

23:41.587 --> 23:43.714
<i>Secretariat's a state of mind.</i>

23:43.797 --> 23:47.676
<i>It's about doing the right thing,</i>
<i>standing up for yourself.</i>

23:47.760 --> 23:51.972
<i>Why, I look around and I see</i>
<i>a whole room full of Secretariats.</i>

23:52.056 --> 23:54.308
<i>You are Secretariat.</i>

23:54.391 --> 23:56.518
<i>And you are Secretariat.</i>

23:56.602 --> 23:59.313
<i>And you... are Secretariat.</i>

24:03.233 --> 24:07.196
BoJack, it's such a beautiful movie
and I think such a textured performance.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.073
When you were on <i>Horsin' Around</i>,

24:09.156 --> 24:12.076
could you ever have imagined
that you'd give a performance like this?

24:12.159 --> 24:15.245
Yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.

24:15.329 --> 24:18.248
I always knew I was more
than just a dumb TV actor.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.877
Even if other people
didn't always know that.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.630
Seriously, though...

24:25.714 --> 24:27.216
that TV show...

24:27.925 --> 24:29.093
it wasn't me.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.637
This movie is me.

24:32.096 --> 24:35.057
And I can't tell you how great it feels
to finally be doing

24:35.140 --> 24:37.685
the kind of work that I can be proud of.
