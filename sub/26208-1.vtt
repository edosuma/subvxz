00:01.807 --> 00:05.576
My name is Lena Grisky
and I go to the best
ballet school in the world.

00:05.610 --> 00:06.778
I have a secret.

00:06.812 --> 00:08.780
I'm a time traveler from 1905

00:08.814 --> 00:11.482
and my boyfriend Henri
is doing everything he can
to get me home.

Go off the beat ♪

00:15.286 --> 00:17.923

My name is Lena Grisky.

01:18.049 --> 01:20.085
I may look like
your average teenager,

01:20.118 --> 01:22.353
but trust me, I'm not.

01:23.021 --> 01:24.455
I have a secret.

01:25.656 --> 01:28.626
The roof of the Opera is mine
and Henri's special place.

01:28.659 --> 01:31.496
We leave each other
little things in the chimney.

01:35.666 --> 01:36.935
(Lena gasps)

01:39.504 --> 01:40.706
For good luck.

01:40.739 --> 01:44.009
It's perfect. I love it.

01:44.042 --> 01:46.577
And I need it
so I don't fall on my face.

01:47.612 --> 01:50.849
It's magic. It will keep you
standing at all times.

01:51.382 --> 01:56.822
(magical tinkling noises)

01:56.855 --> 01:58.924
Thank you.

01:58.957 --> 02:02.093
Oh Henri,
I'm going to keep this forever.

02:02.728 --> 02:04.095
Race you.

02:04.129 --> 02:07.833
Some say I was destined to be
the greatest ballerina
of all time.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.137
I had no idea
what was about to happen.

02:12.170 --> 02:13.772
How could I?

02:14.172 --> 02:16.041
How could anyone?

02:20.445 --> 02:23.381
My parents sent me from Russia
to the Paris Opera Ballet School

02:23.414 --> 02:25.050
when I was eight years old.

02:29.788 --> 02:33.925
(classical music plays)

03:45.931 --> 03:48.699
(audience applauds)

03:54.172 --> 03:57.508
(muted music plays
in the background)

04:01.813 --> 04:04.549
We take her back to Russia.
Tonight.

04:15.193 --> 04:18.964
I don't know
what the fuss is about.
She's behind by an eighth.

04:20.565 --> 04:21.967
How can someone so...

04:22.801 --> 04:26.004
so unmannered in real life
be so graceful on stage?

04:28.707 --> 04:31.609
(audience applauds)

04:36.147 --> 04:39.150
Oh, Claudine!
Wait till you go out there.
There's nothing like it.

04:39.184 --> 04:40.752
You were wonderful.

04:41.186 --> 04:42.754
But mind yourself.
You're so exuberant.

04:42.788 --> 04:45.556
I'm sorry.
I'm just so excited and nervous.

04:45.590 --> 04:48.093
I'm so glad I didn't mess up.
I was behind by an eighth.

04:48.126 --> 04:49.961
You were? I didn't notice.

04:49.995 --> 04:51.596
(knock on the door)

04:53.598 --> 04:56.101
Go. I'll cover for you.

05:08.013 --> 05:08.947
You were amazing.

05:08.980 --> 05:12.050
Well, I had
my good luck charm, didn't I?

05:12.884 --> 05:14.619
What?

05:14.652 --> 05:18.256
I overheard they're
taking you back to Russia.

05:19.590 --> 05:20.458
Oh no.

05:21.192 --> 05:24.195
Go. I'll take care
of my mother alone. Go.

05:27.598 --> 05:29.868
Pack your things.
Your father's waiting outside.

05:30.101 --> 05:31.702
We'll return
to Russia immediately.

05:32.270 --> 05:34.572
Mother, please.

05:34.605 --> 05:37.342
You saw me dance.
I have a chance to make Company.

05:37.375 --> 05:40.245
Must I remind you that
you are Princess Helena Grisky?

05:40.979 --> 05:43.915
You humiliated the family
by running around
with a simple peasant.

05:44.382 --> 05:46.017
How did you...

05:46.284 --> 05:49.888
Your roommate had
enough sense to post a letter.

05:49.921 --> 05:52.323
I had never cared
about being a princess.

05:52.357 --> 05:56.161
None of that mattered to me.
Only to my parents.

05:56.194 --> 05:57.729
All I cared about, was ballet.

05:57.996 --> 06:00.966
It's over. No more ballet.

06:03.334 --> 06:07.305
In that one moment,
in that one statement,

06:07.338 --> 06:09.708
my entire life changed.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.743
How could you?

06:14.245 --> 06:17.148
I made the decision
to change the path
I was born to be on.

06:17.182 --> 06:20.752
I had no idea of the impact
that decision would have.

06:20.786 --> 06:23.855
It would change... everything.

06:24.790 --> 06:26.825
I guess this is goodbye.

06:28.026 --> 06:31.596
I need to get my things.
And then I'm leaving.

06:33.932 --> 06:35.100
Come with me.

06:36.768 --> 06:37.302
Come on.

06:37.936 --> 06:39.170
Are you mad?

06:39.204 --> 06:40.205
Possibly.

06:41.940 --> 06:45.777
(laughter)

06:49.080 --> 06:51.349
That is some getaway outfit.

06:51.382 --> 06:53.885
Well, I didn't have time
to change my shoes, did I?

06:53.919 --> 06:55.921
Not if I wanted
to escape my mother.

06:56.454 --> 06:57.789
Halt. Who goes there?

06:57.823 --> 06:59.925
Quick. This way.

07:00.225 --> 07:01.927
(laughter)

07:01.960 --> 07:02.994
My mother's guards. Run.

07:03.028 --> 07:04.763
Hey. Hey.

07:13.404 --> 07:15.106
Lena?

07:15.140 --> 07:18.276
Come on. What are you doing?
Open the door.

07:22.447 --> 07:24.015
What?

07:26.818 --> 07:29.354
(ticking and magical
tinkling noises)

07:40.198 --> 07:42.400
Henri?
Where are you? Henri?

07:43.334 --> 07:44.770
Whoa, watch where you're going.

07:45.003 --> 07:45.904
I don't know. Where am I?

07:46.137 --> 07:48.406
Get into the line. We're next.

07:49.007 --> 07:51.743
What is she doing here?
Who is she?

07:52.410 --> 07:54.813
Where did she come from? Look
at her dress.

07:54.846 --> 07:58.750
Wow. Gutsy.
Wish I had thought of it.

07:59.017 --> 08:00.351
Wait. What's happening?

08:09.527 --> 08:12.230
(audience laughs
and mutters in shock)

08:16.868 --> 08:18.837
(audience laughs)

08:19.170 --> 08:21.506
Help me. I need to
get out of here. Please.

08:21.539 --> 08:24.142
Get off of me.

08:25.143 --> 08:26.778
Where's Henri?
What are you doing?

08:26.812 --> 08:27.779
Where is he?

08:27.813 --> 08:29.748
Help me, help me.
I need to get out of here.

08:29.781 --> 08:30.515
Get out.

08:30.548 --> 08:32.283
What's wrong with her?

08:38.023 --> 08:39.390
Lena?

08:41.426 --> 08:43.194
Son...

08:43.228 --> 08:44.162
What have you done?

08:47.098 --> 08:51.036
(announcer) It is our pleasure
to introduce the Paris Opera
Ballet, esteemed company

08:51.069 --> 08:53.872
and budding class of 2018.

08:53.905 --> 08:56.942
2018? What is 2018?

08:56.975 --> 09:00.779
Wow, you are taking stage fright
to a wickedly elevated level.

09:01.046 --> 09:03.014
It's 2018. Like the year of...

09:03.314 --> 09:07.252
Year? 2018 is the year?
Oh my...

09:08.887 --> 09:10.756
Oh, are you okay?

09:11.890 --> 09:13.925
(audience mutters)
Is she hurt?

09:13.959 --> 09:16.261
Back up, back up.
Give her some room.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.829
Who is she?
What is she wearing?

09:17.863 --> 09:19.364
This is the Défilé,
not a costume party.

09:19.397 --> 09:21.266
Don't move.
What's your name?

09:21.299 --> 09:23.368
I'm Helena Gr...

09:23.401 --> 09:25.203
Elena Grande? From Italy?

09:25.570 --> 09:27.272
We didn't expect you
for a few more days.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.940
Ines, get the medic.

09:28.974 --> 09:31.042
Okay,
so she's a total drama queen.

09:31.242 --> 09:32.811
No, you don't understand.

09:32.844 --> 09:35.446
It's alright. Don't move.
It's okay.

09:45.023 --> 09:46.291
(Henri pants)

09:48.059 --> 09:49.861
Tell me exactly what happened.

09:49.895 --> 09:51.863
We were just running
through the hall

09:51.897 --> 09:55.333
and then...
she went through the door
and she just disappeared.

09:55.366 --> 09:56.101
Where is it?

09:57.002 --> 09:58.036
The door.
We were just in front of it.

09:58.069 --> 09:59.337
No, I mean the necklace.

09:59.570 --> 10:00.571
Hm...

10:02.440 --> 10:04.609
It's on Lena's neck.

10:04.642 --> 10:05.443
I gathered.

10:06.912 --> 10:07.713
Where did you find it?

10:07.746 --> 10:09.080
It's actually
quite a funny story.

10:09.881 --> 10:11.316
(whistles)

10:14.119 --> 10:15.253
(sneezes)

10:18.423 --> 10:20.225
Wow.

10:25.230 --> 10:27.132
It's just an old necklace.

10:27.165 --> 10:30.869
Why are you giving me the
"you're in deep trouble" look?

10:31.069 --> 10:32.938
Come with me.

10:49.687 --> 10:51.456
You have no idea
what you've done.

10:51.489 --> 10:53.391
I have no idea at all
what is happening right now.

10:53.591 --> 10:55.560
You've sent her spiraling
through time.

10:55.961 --> 10:57.595
At least, you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

10:57.628 --> 11:00.298
I was waiting until you
were older to tell you.

11:00.331 --> 11:04.469
Until you had proven to me
that you were mature enough
to handle it.

11:04.502 --> 11:06.137
Son...

11:07.005 --> 11:08.273
We're time travelers.

11:08.306 --> 11:09.240
What?

11:16.447 --> 11:21.619
But, Dad, how is that possible?
Time travel, that's crazy.

11:26.191 --> 11:27.625
What is this?

11:29.327 --> 11:31.529
Our family has been
time traveling for centuries.

11:33.164 --> 11:34.532
But there are rules.

11:34.565 --> 11:36.301
And you managed
to break them all.

11:36.567 --> 11:38.136
I'm going after her.

11:38.169 --> 11:39.137
Well, I'll come with you.

11:39.170 --> 11:42.607
No, you won't.
You're not authorized to travel.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.043
You've already set in motion
events that can't be undone.

11:46.111 --> 11:49.114
I need to get a few things.
You stay here.

11:49.514 --> 11:52.718
She went
through the Garnier portal
so we know where she landed.

11:52.751 --> 11:54.285
We just don't know when.

11:54.319 --> 11:55.286
What do you mean?

11:55.320 --> 12:01.092
She could be in 1575 or 2030.
We don't know.

12:06.331 --> 12:08.266
You will find her, right?

12:18.443 --> 12:20.178
Elena, good morning.

12:24.315 --> 12:27.452
You really hit your head there.
But luckily, no concussion.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.487
Where is Henri? I must find him.

12:30.488 --> 12:34.159
Is she okay to dance,
because they're calling us
to class, like stat.

12:34.192 --> 12:36.327
Hi, I'm Ines. I'm your roommate.

12:36.361 --> 12:39.197
Wow, your bun is a total
disaster. Have you got a brush?

12:39.230 --> 12:40.465
No, I...

12:41.099 --> 12:42.734
Whoa. For real?

12:44.069 --> 12:45.737
You've got to let
her dance, Nurse D.

12:45.771 --> 12:47.438
You know what it means
if she doesn't.

12:47.472 --> 12:50.341
This is the audition for
Gabrielle's exclusive workshop.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.778
Gives you a leg up
in competish, right?

12:52.811 --> 12:55.446
This is like the Grand Prix of
the Paris Opera Ballet School.

12:55.480 --> 12:56.715
I'm back at the school?

12:56.748 --> 13:00.451
No, we're still at the Garnier,
but we'll go to school later.

13:00.485 --> 13:02.453
I have to go. Now.
I need to go and find...

13:02.487 --> 13:05.323
See? She's totally ready.

13:05.690 --> 13:07.625
Okay, but if you feel faint...

13:07.658 --> 13:09.694
She'll tell me
and I'll tell you.

13:09.728 --> 13:12.998
It'll go down all legal
and legit. Okay, Nurse D?

13:13.364 --> 13:16.067
Okay, but I'm trusting
you with this, Ines.

13:20.305 --> 13:22.407
Impressive entrance you made.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.777
Fainting right in the middle
of the Défilé
in your red dress like that.

13:25.811 --> 13:28.446
It's like,
welcome to the class of 2018,

13:28.479 --> 13:31.382
and you were like... aah.

13:31.416 --> 13:32.784
I have to go.

13:32.818 --> 13:35.453
Come on. Let's get you dressed.

13:44.395 --> 13:47.532
(students chatter on phone)

13:53.404 --> 13:55.140
(phone beeps)

13:56.407 --> 13:58.276
(phone beeps)

13:58.309 --> 14:00.746
Why is everyone
talking to themselves?

14:03.481 --> 14:07.452
(hip-hop beat starts to play)

14:29.775 --> 14:31.777
What's wrong with him?

14:31.810 --> 14:32.811
Yeah, I know.

14:32.844 --> 14:35.580
That's Jeff. He's new too.

14:35.881 --> 14:39.117
Haven't figured him out yet,
but he is a sick dancer.

14:39.150 --> 14:40.518
Oh no, he's ill?

14:40.551 --> 14:42.287
(Ines sniggers)

14:49.694 --> 14:54.432
Whoa, whoa. Hold up.
Where do you think you're going?

14:54.465 --> 14:56.768
We haven't even jammed yet.
Come on. You know...

14:56.802 --> 14:59.704
Uh... Uh... Yeah...
You just gotta let loose.

14:59.905 --> 15:01.773
Yeah. Yeah, You feel me?

15:01.807 --> 15:04.175
How dare you speak
to me that way?

15:04.209 --> 15:08.479
Just relax.
This is our five minutes of fun
before it all gets totally real.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.448
Go on. Try it.

15:10.849 --> 15:14.419
(Jeff beatboxes)
(others laugh)

15:16.922 --> 15:18.824
(music starts again)

15:22.928 --> 15:23.795
Oh.

15:23.829 --> 15:25.196
Now you.

15:26.932 --> 15:28.399
Whoa...

15:29.768 --> 15:33.538
Whoa. Careful, chica.
We don't want you
to fall again, do we?

15:33.805 --> 15:36.808
Hi. Yes, I erm...

15:37.442 --> 15:38.844
As you were.

15:43.949 --> 15:48.519
You are broadcasting
your crush allover the place.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.161
Hello.

16:05.837 --> 16:07.538
Oh.
(others laugh)

16:07.572 --> 16:09.640
Are you trying
to make a run for it now?

16:09.674 --> 16:11.609
Oh, are you
an officer of the law?

16:13.011 --> 16:16.815
If you're not prepared
to leave your souls on the stage

16:17.248 --> 16:20.418
each and every time
you step onto it,

16:20.952 --> 16:23.855
then you need to question
whether or not
you want to be here.

16:26.391 --> 16:29.527
This workshop is
an honor and a privilege.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.563
After the break we'll start
with your unique pieces.

16:32.597 --> 16:33.965
Who is she?

16:34.499 --> 16:37.568
Gabrielle Carré.
I mean, come on.

16:38.336 --> 16:40.438
Only the best
prima ballerina ever.

16:40.739 --> 16:45.510
And she's the Directrice
of the school, so...
No presh.

17:26.084 --> 17:28.319
Oh, hello.

17:28.754 --> 17:31.322
I was just using
this fascinating hand-drier.

17:32.323 --> 17:34.625
What's your deal?
Like, for real.

17:34.659 --> 17:37.295
You come in here
all doe-eyed and fainty.

17:37.328 --> 17:38.363
Who do you think you are?

17:38.396 --> 17:40.398
Oh, I'm
Lena Grisky.

17:40.431 --> 17:41.833
Very funny.

17:41.867 --> 17:45.470
You can try and wow everyone
with your gimmicks
and your diversions,

17:45.503 --> 17:47.005
but you don't fool me.

17:47.038 --> 17:49.975
This is my turf
and I won Dance Off.

17:50.008 --> 17:52.944
So it's my destiny
to make Company and be the best.

17:52.978 --> 17:57.048
So whatever this is, it
stops. Now.

17:57.082 --> 17:59.751
Break's over. Let's go, guys.

18:04.589 --> 18:06.457
What are you waiting for?

18:07.092 --> 18:09.560
I don't belong here.

18:10.428 --> 18:11.897
I must find a way to get back.

18:12.798 --> 18:14.065
Why do you think I'm here?

18:14.699 --> 18:16.434
Come on.

18:34.419 --> 18:36.054
Where is she?

18:42.127 --> 18:43.328
I don't know.

18:43.361 --> 18:47.999
Speak up.
I asked you a question.
Where is my daughter?

18:48.033 --> 18:52.137
Honestly, Your Highness.
She was here.

18:52.170 --> 18:53.004
And now she's not.

18:53.404 --> 18:55.440
(scoffs) Arrest him.

18:55.473 --> 18:57.909
Alex. Don't be ridiculous.

18:59.577 --> 19:02.113
They're children,
playing a game.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.383
We both know
Lena put him up to this.

19:05.416 --> 19:09.020
You know your daughter.
Her favorite defiance
is running away.

19:09.687 --> 19:11.656
Come now. Where is she?

19:11.689 --> 19:13.391
Sir, I have no idea.

19:13.691 --> 19:14.893
(scoffs)

19:28.673 --> 19:30.876
(hurried footsteps)

19:30.909 --> 19:34.880
Okay, so Lena's parents think
she's run away.
Apparently, it's a pattern.

19:34.913 --> 19:39.885
That will only hold for a bit.
I'm going after her
while no one is around.

19:39.918 --> 19:41.086
There is one other thing.

19:41.119 --> 19:42.754
What? We're vampires too?

19:43.021 --> 19:44.790
Beware of the Time Collectors.

19:45.156 --> 19:46.657
What?

19:46.691 --> 19:50.528
Listen to me.
You've opened the portal, so
they'll be after you and Lena.

19:50.729 --> 19:53.832
They were last seen
in the 18th century.
They stand out.

19:53.865 --> 19:56.935
Stay away from them.
Run, hide, whatever it takes.

19:56.968 --> 20:00.505
And don't you go anywhere.
Your instincts lead you
to trouble.

20:11.850 --> 20:14.085
Question. What exactly
are they collecting?

20:15.020 --> 20:18.556
You, Lena.
And all the other timepieces.

20:18.589 --> 20:20.091
So they're the bad guys?

20:20.125 --> 20:23.061
I have to go now,
while the portal is still open.

20:23.094 --> 20:27.165
Portal?
Dad, are you a quantum spy?

20:56.627 --> 20:59.597
(grunts)

21:12.543 --> 21:15.013
So the door is a portal.

21:17.115 --> 21:18.917
Lena, where did you go?

21:29.660 --> 21:32.563
(pop song plays)

21:34.733 --> 21:39.905
Oh no. No, I mean I must return
to where I came from.
I believe I came through a door.

21:42.040 --> 21:45.877
You're weird.
And kind of hilarious.
Come on.

22:35.961 --> 22:38.797
I don't get the whole
Max Alverez thing but...

22:38.830 --> 22:40.465
clearly you're crushing.

22:40.498 --> 22:44.369
Rumor has it he had no
formal ballet training before
coming here a few years ago.

22:44.402 --> 22:45.670
Like zero.

22:46.704 --> 22:49.274
But he can dance,
I'll give him that.

22:49.307 --> 22:54.245
Get this. He went
to Harrow Boarding School.
Totally posh.

22:54.279 --> 22:56.314
But he got kicked out
or something.

22:56.347 --> 22:58.717
He's got secrets. You can tell.

22:59.150 --> 23:04.155
And P. S., he's Thea's guy.
And she already
doesn't like you, so...

23:04.189 --> 23:06.124
She doesn't?

23:06.157 --> 23:08.960
Is there something I can do
to change her mind?

23:08.994 --> 23:11.062
I could send her
a note of apology.

23:11.096 --> 23:13.664
Yeah, a note. That'll help.

23:13.698 --> 23:14.866
Okay.

23:17.335 --> 23:18.904
Anyway...

23:19.771 --> 23:22.373
His mum was English
and his dad was Spanish.

23:22.407 --> 23:26.644
But then there was
this tragic accident and...
They died.

23:26.912 --> 23:28.279
Oh, that's so sad.

23:28.313 --> 23:31.783
Yeah. Apparently, he's got
this massive trust fund.

23:31.817 --> 23:35.253
One girl last year said he might
be related to the Royals.

23:35.286 --> 23:37.355
But I think that's just gossip.

23:38.223 --> 23:42.627
I guess he got sent to his aunt
and she turned him on to ballet.

23:44.429 --> 23:45.997
Hey...

23:46.464 --> 23:48.967
I'm serious.
Thea's guy. Okay?

23:49.735 --> 23:52.003
Hey, new girl.
How are you doin'?

23:53.304 --> 23:55.306
Much better, thank you.

23:56.942 --> 23:59.377
Good. Okay.

24:00.111 --> 24:04.983
So, erm... I'm Dash.
She probably didn't even
mention me, did she?

24:05.884 --> 24:08.754
To be honest,
I'm not even sure
she knows my name.

24:08.987 --> 24:11.222
You're up, Ines.

24:11.890 --> 24:13.959
Oh yeah, she knows my name.

24:14.726 --> 24:16.661
(rock song plays)

24:25.470 --> 24:27.873
Ah, she's amazing.

24:40.285 --> 24:43.221
Wow, I'm striking out today.

25:03.141 --> 25:07.078
A colored picture.
She looks like Lena's mother.

25:12.450 --> 25:17.255
'Victor, the Time Collectors
have done more damage
than I thought possible.

25:17.288 --> 25:19.357
We will not see
each other again.

25:19.891 --> 25:21.960
I will protect my half
with my life

25:21.993 --> 25:24.495
as I'm sure
you will do with yours.

25:24.996 --> 25:29.000
They have caught our friend
and I'm afraid
he will never return.'

25:29.968 --> 25:31.069
(worried) Lena...

25:39.110 --> 25:40.812
'Dear Lena.

25:41.012 --> 25:43.982
I have a strong hope
this message will get to you.

25:44.015 --> 25:46.117
I will put it in our special
place on the roof.

25:46.151 --> 25:50.021
I hope you will go there
and think about the ways
we always communicated.

25:50.055 --> 25:51.422
The chimney.

25:51.456 --> 25:53.959
My father says it is magic.'

25:56.327 --> 26:00.832
Oh Henri. (sobs) Where are you?

26:00.866 --> 26:02.467
(tinkling noise)

26:13.544 --> 26:15.146
(Henri) 'My dear Lena.

26:15.947 --> 26:17.983
My family has a secret.

26:19.217 --> 26:20.518
I didn't know.

26:21.286 --> 26:23.521
Of course I would've told you
if I did.

26:25.023 --> 26:28.359
The good news is
that we are not vampires.'

26:28.393 --> 26:30.228
Henri, just spit it out.

26:31.062 --> 26:32.964
'We're time travelers.

26:33.999 --> 26:35.934
And now, so are you.'
