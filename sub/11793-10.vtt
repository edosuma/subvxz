WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:03.770
 Hey guys, it's me again, Zack,

00:03.803 --> 00:06.639
   and today we have
   another show from the
   junior high days.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.641
   Screech and Lisa
   still look weird.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.644
  Anyways,
  nobody loves a practical joke
  more than I do.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.547
  Especially when
  someone else is the victim.

00:14.581 --> 00:18.518
   Miss Bliss thought she was
   pretty cool 'cause nobody
   could ever prank her.

00:18.551 --> 00:21.254
   Unfortunately, it got
   out of hand when we tried

00:21.287 --> 00:23.189
  and Screech had
  to be put on trial.

00:23.223 --> 00:25.859
Now wait 'til
you see Belding get
it in this one.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.229
   Oh, Zack.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.736
( bell rings )

00:36.770 --> 00:40.106
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:40.140 --> 00:42.842
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:46.146
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:46.179 --> 00:49.449
  <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
  <i>just in time to</i>
  <i>see the bus fly by</i>

00:49.482 --> 00:54.754
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:54.788 --> 00:58.224
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:58.258 --> 01:01.161
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

01:01.194 --> 01:04.230
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

01:04.263 --> 01:07.667
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>it'll be all right</i>

01:07.701 --> 01:11.805
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:25.685 --> 01:28.855
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:28.888 --> 01:32.425
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:32.459 --> 01:36.262
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:41.901 --> 01:44.137
    Carrie:
   <i>It's Hoosier Harvest Week,</i>

01:44.170 --> 01:47.507
 <i>a time for hay-rides,</i>
 <i>bonfires,</i>
 <i>and practical jokes,</i>

01:47.540 --> 01:50.510
   <i>and everyone's fair game.</i>

01:50.543 --> 01:52.846
   <i>In my eleven years at JFK</i>

01:52.879 --> 01:56.549
  <i>no one's ever</i>
  <i>successfully pulled</i>
  <i>a prank on me.</i>

01:56.583 --> 01:59.219
  <i>Maybe this year</i>
  <i>they'll stop trying.</i>

02:01.421 --> 02:03.056
 You're taking quite a chance.

02:03.056 --> 02:08.127
 Hey, it's worth it to be in
 the history books as the
 first ones to get Miss Bliss.

02:08.161 --> 02:11.264
 If this doesn't work,
 I got a great way to get her.

02:11.297 --> 02:15.201
Save it for next year,
Screech. Watch the pros.

02:15.235 --> 02:18.471
   You guys better hurry,
   Bliss just left
   Belding's office.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.519
( whispering )
What's going on?

02:32.552 --> 02:34.521
   We're getting Miss Bliss.

02:34.554 --> 02:37.390
   -Think she'll fall for it?
   -Absolutely...

02:37.424 --> 02:38.558
( loudly ) Not!

02:40.360 --> 02:42.796
 Zack: Uh, Miss Bliss.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.765
 Nice try, Zack.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.435
 You and Lisa can take
 it down after class.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.537
  Everyone take their seats.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.472
 Yes...

02:52.505 --> 02:55.675
  As I'm sure
  you'll all remember,

02:55.709 --> 02:58.645
 today's subject is our
 governmental judicial system.

02:59.713 --> 03:03.216
Zack, can you shed some
light on this, please?

03:03.249 --> 03:05.752
  Well, I planned on
  reading the chapter

03:05.785 --> 03:08.788
  but I had to decide
  who to take to the
  hay ride on Friday,

03:08.822 --> 03:11.524
 and interviews ran
 a little longer than expected.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.595
What'd you promise them?
No kiss goodnight?

03:16.663 --> 03:19.299
  Okay. Okay, settle.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.267
   Now, in the United States,

03:21.301 --> 03:24.337
   you're presumed innocent,
   until proven guilty.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.240
Uh, Miss Bliss,
would you mind
telling my parents that?

03:28.942 --> 03:31.678
Who can tell me what the
Fifth Amendment is?

03:31.711 --> 03:33.680
  Thou shalt not kill?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.750
 That's the fifth commandment,
 Samuel.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.518
  Oh.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.620
Didn't anyone do
their homework?

03:40.653 --> 03:43.423
 Were you all too
 busy planning pranks?

03:43.456 --> 03:47.394
 Uh, Miss Bliss, I had trouble
 understanding the homework.

03:47.427 --> 03:51.698
   Yeah, is there
   a chart that explains this
   judicial stuff?

03:51.731 --> 03:54.768
 As a matter of fact, there is.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.437
  Why don't you guys
  just point an arrow?

03:57.470 --> 04:00.840
 Make sure they
 spell my name right in
 the history books.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.680
  ( students mumbling
  among themselves )

04:08.782 --> 04:11.618
   Students: Aw man!

04:11.651 --> 04:14.287
   How does she always know?

04:14.320 --> 04:19.559
Now look.
These practical
jokes have got to stop!

04:19.591 --> 04:22.462
   For a start,
   they're never gonna work.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.898
 Only a fool would
 fall for one of these.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.801
 Miss Bliss...

04:29.402 --> 04:31.504
( all laughing )

04:33.873 --> 04:35.709
 Let me rephrase that.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.682
  The fireworks
  are about to begin.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.919
When Miss Bliss wasn't
 looking, I put chili
pepper in her coleslaw!

04:45.952 --> 04:47.687
 We'll see who gets her first!

04:47.721 --> 04:50.957
  I spiked Miss
  Bliss' tomato juice,
  with tabasco sauce!

04:50.990 --> 04:54.561
 With any luck,
 when she sneezes she'll
 set off the sprinkler system.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.769
Why are
the kids looking at me?

05:02.802 --> 05:05.438
 They must be up to something.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.341
 Mr. Belding,
 would you just relax?
 You're being paranoid.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.909
   I'm not paranoid.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.746
  I'm just sure
  they did something.
  They always do.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.647
  That's why I brought
  my lunch from home.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.450
  -I think you're overreacting.
  -Oh, am I?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.919
Last year they
stole my hamburger and
glued my buns together!

05:22.355 --> 05:23.656
  I know why they're looking.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.593
 They got to my lunch.

05:26.626 --> 05:29.362
   Mr. Belding, you're right.
   You're not paranoid.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.064
 You're way past that.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.833
 I can't eat anything.
 You go ahead,

05:33.867 --> 05:36.503
  eat, don't mind me.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.375
 Mmm. That coleslaw
 looks good, Miss Bliss.

05:42.409 --> 05:45.812
   -Would you like some,
   Mr. Belding?
   -Well, maybe just a bite.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.550
I'm really looking
forward to this weekend.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.086
 Mrs. Belding
 and I are going to...

05:53.086 --> 05:55.455
Oh. Oh!

05:55.488 --> 05:58.558
 -Ohio?
 -( gasping )

05:58.591 --> 06:00.660
Hawaii?

06:02.896 --> 06:05.031
  Oh!

06:05.031 --> 06:07.267
   Oh, that's better.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.036
  You know for
  a minute there I...

06:10.036 --> 06:12.739
  ( groaning )

06:12.772 --> 06:15.408
 Omaha?

06:19.045 --> 06:22.515
  Kids, that wasn't very nice.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.553
 But it was very funny!

06:26.586 --> 06:29.055
  ( laughing )

06:36.629 --> 06:39.065
Good morning, everyone,
I have
an announcement to make.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.268
  Now,
  I realize it's harvest week.

06:42.302 --> 06:46.172
But we have got to get
 through this material
on our judicial system.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.074
  So while you're in my class

06:48.074 --> 06:50.944
I want these
practical jokes to stop.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.780
 -Is that understood?
 -( students ) Yes, Miss Bliss.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.782
 Good.

06:55.815 --> 06:58.918
  We will open our
  books at chapter...

06:58.952 --> 07:02.022
   Oh, my...

07:02.022 --> 07:03.757
 ( students laughing )

07:05.158 --> 07:07.827
  Miss Bliss!
  We finally got you!

07:07.861 --> 07:09.095
 ( students laughing )

07:09.129 --> 07:10.497
  This is not funny!

07:12.766 --> 07:14.567
  Who put paint on my chair?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.139
 Okay, let me put it this way.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.808
   Who put paint on my chair?

07:24.611 --> 07:26.246
Alright.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.281
   Now look,

07:28.314 --> 07:31.651
   I am going to go
   change my sweater.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.587
 If the guilty party
 hasn't come forward by
 the time I come back,

07:34.621 --> 07:37.057
   the whole class
   will be punished.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.296
   Hey, it wasn't me.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.065
 We were all together.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.167
 That's right. We were!

07:47.200 --> 07:48.568
  Everyone except me!

07:51.338 --> 07:52.739
 Uh-oh.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.075
Screech! You're a hero!

07:55.108 --> 07:58.745
   -You're the only
   person to get Miss Bliss!
   -Yeah!

07:58.778 --> 08:01.548
  -You'll go down in history!
  -That's right!

08:01.581 --> 08:04.284
I will!

08:05.118 --> 08:07.120
Alright.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.290
Who's the guilty party?

08:12.892 --> 08:15.528
 Me. I did it.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.796
  I'm famous.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.833
  Samuel? You?

08:19.866 --> 08:22.635
 I'm gonna go down in history,
 Miss Bliss.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.038
 You're going down to
 the principal's office,
 Mr. Powers,

08:25.071 --> 08:26.906
and pay for my sweater!

08:27.941 --> 08:29.175
 Wait a minute!

08:29.209 --> 08:32.044
I said I did it,
but I didn't mean I did!

08:32.846 --> 08:34.313
 I'm innocent!

08:35.315 --> 08:36.783
Samuel, get up!

08:38.318 --> 08:40.587
 First you say you did it,
 then you say you're innocent.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.621
 Which is it?

08:42.655 --> 08:44.791
 Can I plead insanity?

08:44.824 --> 08:47.927
 Sure, take the easy way out.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.230
  There's only one
  way to settle this.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.799
  -We'll have a trial.
  -A trial?

08:52.832 --> 08:54.801
 Yes, a trial!

08:54.834 --> 08:58.371
  Tomorrow,
  this class room will become a
  court of law.

08:58.405 --> 09:03.009
 You'll find the guidelines of
 a trial in chapters number six
 and seven of your textbooks.

09:03.009 --> 09:06.713
Samuel, your peers
will decide your fate.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.018
Is it possible to
get a new set of peers?

09:18.091 --> 09:20.126
   All rise.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.931
   Court is now in session.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.334
 The honorable
 Miss Bliss presiding.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.269
  Thank you, bailiff.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.639
  You may be seated.

09:35.809 --> 09:39.612
I would like to begin
by putting the defendant
at ease.

09:39.646 --> 09:42.082
  Samuel, if you're innocent,

09:42.115 --> 09:44.050
  as you say you are,

09:44.050 --> 09:46.653
 trust in the system, it works.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.356
 Thank you, Miss Bliss.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.791
   I'll remember that when
   I'm in jail, stamping out
   your license plate.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.729
Miss Prosecutor,
you may begin.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.931
  I'd like to call
  a surprise witness.

09:57.964 --> 10:00.400
 -Lisa Turtle.
 -Me?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.235
 I didn't know you were gonna
 call me!

10:02.268 --> 10:03.536
That's why they call it
a surprise.

10:05.872 --> 10:08.308
  Carrie: Now bailiff,
  will you swear in
  the witness, please.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.979
Do you swear to
tell the truth,

10:13.013 --> 10:15.348
   the whole truth,
   and nothing but
   the truth?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.816
 I do.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.418
   Do guys with curly
   hair turn you on?

10:18.451 --> 10:19.819
  No.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.955
  Bailiff!
  Stop hitting on the witness.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.158
   Now, Miss Turtle,

10:25.191 --> 10:28.294
 were you in
 the cafeteria when the
 defendant announced

10:28.328 --> 10:31.297
 -he was planning
 a prank on Miss Bliss?
 -Yes.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.466
He said that he was
going to get Miss Bliss

10:33.500 --> 10:36.403
 and that he was
 looking for volunteers
 to help him.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.239
 And yesterday,
 just before the crime,

10:39.272 --> 10:41.474
  did you see
  anything suspicious?

10:41.508 --> 10:43.376
  Yes.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.346
 Well, will you
 tell us what you saw?

10:46.379 --> 10:50.316
  I saw
  a suspicious person stash a
  can in the locker.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.118
   Your Honor, it was awful!

10:52.552 --> 10:54.087
Tell us,

10:54.120 --> 10:56.756
   is that
   suspicious person you saw

10:56.790 --> 10:58.958
-in the courtroom today?
-Yes!

10:58.992 --> 11:01.161
  It was that man!
  He's the one I saw!

11:01.194 --> 11:03.196
   I'd never forget his face.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.200
 No further
 questions, Your Honor.

11:09.469 --> 11:14.307
 Defense attorney,
 you may cross-examine
 the witness.

11:14.341 --> 11:18.211
   Lisa, I notice
   you're wearing a band-aid
   on your finger.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.747
-Tell us what happened?
-I broke a nail.

11:20.780 --> 11:21.981
Oh, my.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.284
 No doubt a very
 traumatic experience.

11:24.317 --> 11:28.121
The most!
I was embarrassed to wave
to anyone I knew!

11:28.154 --> 11:31.458
  Aha! You mean you
  were under so much
  stress you couldn't think?

11:31.491 --> 11:34.094
   Were you angry?
   Upset? Confused?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.829
  Yes... No!

11:35.862 --> 11:37.897
 I don't know!

11:37.931 --> 11:40.100
 Oh, great.
 I broke another nail!

11:40.133 --> 11:42.168
This is awful.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.838
   Your Honor,
   can the bailiff restrain her
   for her own protection?

11:44.871 --> 11:46.506
 Bailiff! Keep your distance!

11:52.345 --> 11:54.114
 ( Tina whistling )

11:55.515 --> 11:56.916
 What's going on here?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.318
 I'm trying to cheer up
 Mr. Belding.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.920
 Happy Harvest
 Week always makes him
 so depressed.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.357
   And what's that?

12:04.391 --> 12:05.458
  ( Tina squeals )

12:06.793 --> 12:08.428
   ( stammering )

12:08.461 --> 12:09.896
 Helium tank.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.498
  See, see, that's a "uh-uh."

12:11.531 --> 12:14.434
See, our union contract,
rule number

12:14.467 --> 12:18.304
   88.61.E clearly states,

12:18.338 --> 12:22.776
 devices like these
 must be operated by
 a trained technician.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.211
 -Someone like myself.
 -Mylo!

12:25.245 --> 12:28.114
All you have to do is
push this little valve.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.217
   The contract also states

12:31.251 --> 12:33.887
 that you need
 one and a half men
 for this job.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.356
   Don't do a thing!

12:36.389 --> 12:38.358
  I'll be right back
  with Shorty Beanie.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.929
  Mylo, it's just one valve!

12:42.962 --> 12:45.231
-( Tina sighing )
-Has Miss Bliss
picked up her mail yet?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.167
 Not yet, Mr. Belding!

12:47.200 --> 12:49.969
   Good! I still have
   time to nail her.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.439
I figure, if you
can't beat 'em, join 'em.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.209
( angrily ) Oh nuts!

12:56.242 --> 12:57.544
   Could you please
   tie this for me?

12:57.577 --> 13:00.146
 I just have to run to
 my classroom and get
 a little more ribbon.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.248
  Thank you!

13:09.055 --> 13:11.057
 Morning, Mr. Belding!

13:11.057 --> 13:13.460
   ( high-pitched voice )
   Good morning, Miss Bliss!

13:13.493 --> 13:16.329
   Let me guess,
   Alvin and the Chipmunks?

13:16.363 --> 13:18.331
  ( phone ringing )

13:18.365 --> 13:20.867
  Oh, uh, would you
  get the phone for me,
  Miss Bliss?

13:22.902 --> 13:26.339
  Ah! You'll have to
  be craftier than that
  to get me!

13:26.373 --> 13:29.376
I don't want to get
an earful of shoe polish
like you got last year!

13:30.543 --> 13:33.279
 Oh,
 by the way, this is for you.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.150
 A subpoena to
 appear in your class?

13:37.183 --> 13:39.219
   ( laughing ) This
   is a joke, right?

13:39.252 --> 13:42.088
   No! It's totally legitimate!
   Honest!

13:42.122 --> 13:43.590
   See you in court!

13:45.892 --> 13:48.328
 ( phone continues ringing )

13:50.430 --> 13:52.932
Hello?

13:53.466 --> 13:55.101
  No!

14:01.341 --> 14:05.078
 Raise your right hand,
 Mr. Belding.

14:05.111 --> 14:09.115
 -That's your left.
 -I know that,
 just get on with it.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.519
   I would like to remind
   the witness that this
   is a court of law

14:12.552 --> 14:15.321
 and you will follow the proper
 legal procedure.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.756
  Okay, okay.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.362
( students laughing )

14:22.395 --> 14:24.664
 Would you like to
 call another witness,
 Mr. Belding?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.602
 Do you swear to tell the truth

14:29.636 --> 14:32.138
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth?

14:32.172 --> 14:33.773
   Of course I do!
   I'm a principal!

14:38.178 --> 14:40.447
  Councilor.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.315
   Now, Mr. Belding,

14:42.349 --> 14:44.250
  how well do you
  know the defendant?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.319
   -Not very well.
   -Would you say
   that's because he's never

14:46.353 --> 14:48.221
   been sent to your office for
   disciplinary action?

14:48.254 --> 14:51.458
  -That's correct.
  -You'd usually
  remember the troublemakers?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.126
Exactly, like you, Zack.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.295
  Your Honor!

14:55.328 --> 14:57.664
  Will the witness
  please stick to the facts?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.632
 Why not? I'm
 sticking to everything else.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.103
He's all yours.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.407
 Mr. Belding,

15:07.440 --> 15:10.043
 this is Lisa Turtle.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.312
Would you classify
her as a troublemaker?

15:12.345 --> 15:15.315
   Of course not.
   Lisa is a wonderful girl.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.650
Then would it
surprise that this
wonderful girl

15:17.684 --> 15:20.320
   helped rig the water
   prank that drenched you?

15:20.353 --> 15:21.454
Nikki!

15:22.555 --> 15:25.325
 Lisa?
 I wanna see you after class.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.461
Thank you, Mr. Belding,

15:28.495 --> 15:30.597
for disproving
the Zack Morris theory.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.301
 -But I...
 -Thank you, you may sit down.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.578
 Nikki, do you have
 any other witnesses?

15:45.612 --> 15:50.216
No, but I'd like to
introduce some evidence
to the court.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.153
   These are some items I found
   in Screech's locker.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.788
   A surgical mask?

15:54.821 --> 15:56.456
( students laughing )

15:56.489 --> 15:58.425
 This is what I had to
 wear to go in there.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.229
 I'd like to
 introduce exhibit A.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.498
  Paintbrush.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.068
 -That's from my art class.
 -I object!

16:08.101 --> 16:11.471
 Your Honor,
 nobody gave her permission
 to go into Screech's locker.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.740
Under our Fourth Amendment,
we're protected against

16:13.773 --> 16:16.209
  illegal search and seizure.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.678
Very good, Zack!

16:18.712 --> 16:21.348
   All that evidence
   is inadmissible.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.452
 Jury will disregard
 what they just heard.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.320
  ( bell ringing )

16:27.354 --> 16:31.358
   Court is
   adjourned until tomorrow.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.394
 Zack, what do you
 think are my chances?

16:34.427 --> 16:35.628
 ( scoffs )

16:41.835 --> 16:42.902
 ( gabble banging )

16:42.936 --> 16:46.206
   This court is in session!

16:46.239 --> 16:48.508
   Screech,
   I told you to look good!

16:49.542 --> 16:50.610
   I don't?

16:52.379 --> 16:53.813
  Mr. Morris?

16:53.847 --> 16:56.549
  You present your witnesses.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.252
   I only have one witness.
   The defendant.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.920
   Please call Samuel Powers,

17:01.021 --> 17:05.692
AKA the Screechster,
AKA the Brush,
AKA Guilty as Charged.

17:07.761 --> 17:11.498
 And I would ask Your Honor to
 instruct the jury to
 disregard his clothing.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.634
   So noted.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.805
  Do you swear to tell
  the truth, the whole truth

17:18.838 --> 17:20.874
  and nothing but the truth?

17:22.342 --> 17:25.345
 Okay, but you've just weakened
 my entire defense.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.282
 Mr. Morris, you may proceed.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.285
 Thank you, Your Honor,
 and may I say

17:32.318 --> 17:34.287
that's a lovely hairdo.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.489
Oh, thank you.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.325
  But may I remind you
  that it's the jury,
  not the judge,

17:39.359 --> 17:42.395
 that decides
 the guilt or innocence
 of your client.

17:44.831 --> 17:48.601
 So many lovely hairdos
 here today.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.871
 Will the Council
 please keep the kissing up
 to a minimum?

17:51.905 --> 17:54.474
 Oh, of course,
 Your Beautiful Honor.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.284
 -Samuel Powers, did you do it?
 -No.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.586
  No further questions.
  The defense rests.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.323
( sarcastically )
Thank you, Perry Mason.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.926
 Miss Coleman,

18:13.026 --> 18:15.161
you may cross examine.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.696
  Mr. Powers,

18:16.730 --> 18:19.532
now isn't it true,
in front of witnesses,

18:19.566 --> 18:21.568
you said, and I quote,

18:21.601 --> 18:24.337
 "I'm going to get Miss Bliss."

18:24.371 --> 18:25.739
 Well, it's true but...

18:25.772 --> 18:28.575
 That's why you went to
 your locker that day,
 isn't it?

18:28.608 --> 18:31.845
 To get something to
 pull off your vicious
 practical joke.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.249
I'd rather not say.
But thanks for asking.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.252
  Please answer the question.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.687
  Objection.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.823
 Your Honor,
 I cite chapter seven of our
 textbook, the Fifth Amendment.

18:43.857 --> 18:46.826
 The defendant
 has a right not to
 incriminate himself.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.863
  Sustained.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.365
  No more questions.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.334
  You may step down.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.507
  You may now proceed with your
  closing arguments.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.008
 Miss Coleman, please.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.444
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.547
 I have three simple questions.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.250
  Did Screech want
  to get Miss Bliss?

19:10.283 --> 19:11.584
 Yes.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.287
   Did Screech have
   the opportunity to do it?

19:14.320 --> 19:15.422
 Yes.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.257
Was Screech
clever enough to do it?

19:18.591 --> 19:19.893
   Make that two
   simple questions.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.499
Thank you. Mr. Morris.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.902
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.537
 Screech didn't do it.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.039
  And nobody has
  proven that he did.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.576
  Look at this face!

19:38.378 --> 19:39.713
  Those eyes.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.948
These clothes.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.484
 Ask yourself one key question.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.253
  Hasn't he suffered enough?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.890
  Thank you, I rest my case.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.562
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.832
 You will now deliberate,
 and decide upon your verdict.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.035
  What do you think?

20:02.068 --> 20:05.405
The longer they're out,
the better the chances.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.506
 We have a verdict, Your Honor.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.641
<i>C'est la vie,</i> old buddy!

20:09.676 --> 20:11.678
  Will
  the defendant please rise?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.448
Carrie: The bailiff
will read the verdict.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.751
 Whoa!

20:17.784 --> 20:21.354
 Would you mind
 sharing that "whoa"
 with the rest of us?

20:21.388 --> 20:24.991
 The jury finds
 the defendant Samuel Powers,

20:25.025 --> 20:26.860
   not guilty on
   lack of evidence!

20:26.893 --> 20:28.361
Woo-hoo!

20:28.395 --> 20:29.996
( applause )

20:30.030 --> 20:31.998
  ( gabble banging )
  Order! Order!

20:32.032 --> 20:35.669
Miss Bliss, if Screech
didn't do it, who did?

20:35.702 --> 20:38.071
   The person who did it
   is in this room.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.740
 And I want him to
 stand up, right now.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.647
   ( students surprised )

20:47.681 --> 20:50.050
You pulled
the prank on yourself?

20:50.083 --> 20:52.419
 That's right.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.955
No one was paying any
attention in my class.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.792
 And I figured
 this was the only way
 that I could get you

20:58.825 --> 21:01.594
 to study those chapters on our
 judicial system.

21:02.062 --> 21:03.697
 I feel so...

21:04.497 --> 21:05.765
 Used.

21:05.799 --> 21:06.900
   ( bell rings )

21:06.933 --> 21:08.735
 Case closed, jury dismissed.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.604
See you on Monday.
Have a lovely weekend.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.373
   You know what this means?

21:13.406 --> 21:15.608
  This means nobody's
  gotten Miss Bliss!

21:15.642 --> 21:17.110
 And they never will.

21:20.080 --> 21:23.116
 You're a real sport,
 I'm glad you're not mad at me.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.552
   Are you kidding?
   This has been
   the best week of my life!

21:25.585 --> 21:27.420
  I was a celebrity.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.390
  Then I hope you'll
  forgive my court for not
  finding you guilty.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.424
Screech: Stupid thing.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.860
Carrie: There's something
that bothers me, though.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.662
  Since I painted the chair,

21:35.695 --> 21:37.530
   why did you take the fifth?

21:38.565 --> 21:40.400
 Here, let me.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.801
  Ah!

21:41.835 --> 21:43.737
 ( alarm sounding )

21:49.976 --> 21:51.778
  ( instrumental music plays )
