WEBVTT

00:56.890 --> 01:00.142
Morning in Paris
The city awakes

01:00.226 --> 01:03.479
To the bells of Notre Dame

01:03.563 --> 01:07.107
The fisherman fishes
The baker man bakes

01:07.150 --> 01:10.235
To the bells of Notre Dame

01:10.320 --> 01:13.739
To the big bells as loud as the thunder

01:13.823 --> 01:17.409
To the little bells soft as a psalm

01:17.494 --> 01:20.829
And some say the soul
of the city's the toll

01:20.914 --> 01:23.082
Of the bells

01:24.084 --> 01:31.090
The bells of Notre Dame

01:31.591 --> 01:34.259
Listen. They're beautiful, no?

01:34.344 --> 01:38.180
So many colours of sound,
so many changing moods.

01:38.264 --> 01:41.433
Because you know they don't
ring all by themselves.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.602
- They don't?
- No, you silly boy.

01:43.686 --> 01:47.356
Up there, high,
high in the dark bell tower,

01:47.440 --> 01:50.275
lives the mysterious bell ringer.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.528
- Who is this creature?
- Who?

01:52.612 --> 01:53.946
- What is he?
- What?

01:54.030 --> 01:56.365
- How did he come to be there?
- How?

01:56.449 --> 01:57.950
Hush.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.035
Clopin will tell you.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.789
It is a tale, a tale of a man...

02:03.873 --> 02:06.291
And a monster.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.711
Dark was the night
when our tale was begun

02:09.796 --> 02:12.172
On the docks near Notre Dame

02:12.215 --> 02:13.841
- Shut it up, will you?
- We'll be spotted!

02:13.883 --> 02:14.883
Hush, little one.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.178
Four frightened gypsies
slid silently under

02:18.221 --> 02:20.806
The docks near Notre Dame

02:20.890 --> 02:22.766
Four guilders
for safe passage into Paris.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.727
A trap had been laid for the gypsies

02:25.812 --> 02:29.273
And they gazed up in fear and alarm

02:29.357 --> 02:31.108
At a figure whose clutches

02:31.192 --> 02:33.986
Were iron as much as the bells

02:34.070 --> 02:35.237
Judge Claude Frollo!

02:35.864 --> 02:40.075
The bells of Notre Dame

02:40.160 --> 02:42.828
Kyrie eleison

02:42.912 --> 02:48.083
Judge Claude Frollo longed to purge
the world of vice and sin

02:48.126 --> 02:50.836
Kyrie eleison

02:50.962 --> 02:53.422
And he saw corruption

02:53.506 --> 02:57.092
Everywhere except within

02:57.177 --> 03:00.095
Bring these gypsy vermin
to the palace ofjustice.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.763
You there! What are you hiding?

03:01.848 --> 03:05.100
Stolen goods, no doubt.
Take them from her.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.269
She ran.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.856
Dies irae
Dies irae

03:10.940 --> 03:14.276
Dies illa
Dies illa

03:14.319 --> 03:17.529
Solvet saeclum in favilla

03:20.450 --> 03:25.037
Quantus tremor est futurus

03:25.121 --> 03:27.956
Quando judex est venturus

03:28.041 --> 03:30.542
Sanctuary! Please, give us sanctuary!

03:30.627 --> 03:34.129
Quantus tremor est futurus

03:38.635 --> 03:40.636
Dies irae

03:41.971 --> 03:43.472
A baby?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.642
A monster!

03:46.684 --> 03:50.229
Solvet saeclum in favilla

03:50.313 --> 03:54.816
Dies irae
Dies irae

04:01.741 --> 04:04.660
"Stop!" cried the archdeacon.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.328
This is an unholy demon.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.830
I'm sending it back to hell,
where it belongs.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.167
See, there, the innocent blood
you have spilt

04:12.252 --> 04:14.461
On the steps of Notre Dame

04:14.504 --> 04:17.005
I am guiltless. She ran. I pursued.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.259
Now you would add this child's
blood to your guilt

04:20.343 --> 04:22.302
On the steps of Notre Dame

04:22.345 --> 04:23.679
My conscience is clear.

04:23.721 --> 04:26.765
You can lie to yourself
and your minions

04:26.849 --> 04:29.977
You can claim that you haven't a qualm

04:30.103 --> 04:32.437
But you never can run from

04:32.522 --> 04:35.899
Nor hide what you've done
from the eyes

04:36.776 --> 04:38.568
The very eyes

04:38.653 --> 04:42.030
Of Notre Dame

04:42.073 --> 04:44.574
Kyrie eleison

04:44.701 --> 04:47.452
And for one time in his life

04:47.537 --> 04:49.454
Of power and control

04:49.539 --> 04:52.207
Kyrie eleison

04:52.250 --> 04:59.131
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
for his immortal soul

04:59.215 --> 05:00.257
What must I do?

05:00.383 --> 05:03.176
Care for the child
and raise it as your own.

05:03.219 --> 05:06.888
What? I am to be saddled
with this misshapen...

05:07.974 --> 05:09.016
Very well.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.476
But let him live with you in your church.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.562
Live here? Where?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.147
Anywhere.

05:15.231 --> 05:19.318
Just so he's kept locked away
where no one else can see

05:19.402 --> 05:21.320
The bell tower, perhaps.

05:21.404 --> 05:25.324
And who knows? Our Lord works
in mysterious ways.

05:26.659 --> 05:31.038
Even this foul creature
may yet prove one day to be

05:31.914 --> 05:35.500
Of use to me

05:35.585 --> 05:39.004
And Frollo gave the child a cruel name,

05:39.088 --> 05:41.923
a name that means "half-formed."

05:42.008 --> 05:44.259
Quasimodo.

05:44.302 --> 05:48.930
Now here is a riddle to guess if you can

05:49.015 --> 05:52.434
Sing the bells of Notre Dame

05:52.518 --> 05:57.773
Who is the monster and who is the man

05:57.857 --> 06:01.777
Sing the bells, bells
Bells, bells

06:01.861 --> 06:05.113
Bells, bells
Bells, bells

06:05.198 --> 06:10.786
Bells of Notre Dame

06:35.645 --> 06:37.312
Good morning.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.400
Will today be the day?
Are you ready to fly?

06:42.318 --> 06:44.986
You sure? Good day to try.

06:45.071 --> 06:49.658
Why, if I picked a day to fly,
this would be it.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.952
The Festival of Fools.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.584
It will be fun with jugglers
and music and dancing.

07:08.928 --> 07:12.431
Go on. Nobody wants
to be cooped up here forever.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.440
Man!

07:21.524 --> 07:24.359
I thought he'd never leave.
I'll be spittin' feathers for a week.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.529
Well, that's what you get
for sleeping with your mouth open.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.864
Go scare a nun.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.324
Hey, Quasi, what's goin' on out there?
A fight? A flogging?

07:31.367 --> 07:33.368
- A festival.
- You mean a Feast of Fools?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.705
All right, all right!
Pour the wine and cut the cheese.

07:36.747 --> 07:40.333
It is a treat to watch the colourful
pageantry of the simple peasant folk.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.627
Boy, nothin' like balcony seats
for watching the ol' FOF.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.296
Yeah, watchin'.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.548
Look. A mime.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.222
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What gives?

07:54.307 --> 07:57.058
Aren't you
going to watch the festival with us?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.768
- I don't get it.
- Perhaps he's sick.

07:58.853 --> 07:59.853
Impossible.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.982
If 20 years of listenin' to you two hasn't
made him sick by now, nothin' will.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.609
Watching the Festival of Fools

08:05.693 --> 08:08.069
has always been the highlight
of the year for Quasimodo.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.489
What good is watchin' the party
if you never get to go?

08:10.573 --> 08:13.325
Here, get away from me!
Go on, ya bunch of buzzards!

08:13.409 --> 08:15.452
He's not made of stone, like us.

08:33.513 --> 08:37.516
Quasi, what's wrong?
You want to tell ol' Laverne all about it?

08:38.351 --> 08:41.102
I just don't feel
like watching the festival, that's all.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.605
Well, did ya ever think
of goin' there instead?

08:43.689 --> 08:46.024
Sure. But I'd never fit in out there.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.443
I'm not normal.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.196
Quasi, Quasi, Quasi.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.364
Do ya mind?

08:52.448 --> 08:55.784
I would like to have a moment
with the boy, if it's all right with you!

08:55.826 --> 08:57.369
Hey, quit beatin' around the bell tower.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.579
What do we gotta do, paint ya a fresco?

08:59.622 --> 09:02.707
As your friends and guardians,
we insist you attend the festival.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.085
- Me?
- No, the pope. Of course, you!

09:05.127 --> 09:07.796
It would be a veritable potpourri
of educational experience.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.172
Wine, women and song.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.299
You can learn to identify
various regional cheeses.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.635
- Bobbin' for snails.
- Study indigenous folk music.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.470
Playin' dunk the monk!

09:15.555 --> 09:19.641
Quasi, take it from an old spectator.
Life's not a spectator sport.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.476
If watchin' is all you're gonna do,

09:21.561 --> 09:24.145
then you're gonna watch
your life go by without ya.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.983
Yeah, you're human, with the flesh
and the hair and the navel lint.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.151
We're just part of the architecture.
Right, Victor?

09:30.236 --> 09:33.572
Yet, if you kick us, will we not flake?

09:33.656 --> 09:37.367
If you moisten us,
do we not grow moss?

09:37.451 --> 09:40.203
Quasi, just grab a fresh tunic
and a clean pair of hose, and...

09:40.288 --> 09:43.915
Thanks for the encouragement.
But you're all forgetting one big thing.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.083
What?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.669
My master, Frollo.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.963
Yeah. Oh, dear, yes.

09:50.089 --> 09:54.259
Well, when he says you're forbidden
from ever leaving the bell tower,

09:54.343 --> 09:56.011
does he mean "ever," ever?

09:56.053 --> 09:58.930
Never ever.
And he hates the Feast of Fools.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.517
- He'd be furious if I asked to go.
- Who says ya gotta ask?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.519
- Oh, no.
- Ya sneak out.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.187
- It's just one afternoon.
- I couldn't.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.064
And ya sneak back in.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.400
- He'll never know you were gone.
- And if I got caught?

10:10.484 --> 10:12.360
Better to beg forgiveness
than ask permission.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.445
He might see me.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.697
You could wear a disguise.
Just this once.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.616
What Frollo doesn't know can't hurt ya.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.534
- Ignorance is bliss.
- Look who's talkin'.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.579
Nobody wants to stay
cooped up here forever.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.998
You're right. I'll go.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.125
- I'll get cleaned up.
- Yes, sir!

10:27.209 --> 10:29.044
- I'll stroll down those stairs.
- There ya go!

10:29.128 --> 10:30.503
I'll march through the doors and...

10:30.838 --> 10:32.213
Good morning, Quasimodo.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.885
Good morning, Master.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.888
Dear boy, whomever are you talking to?

10:40.222 --> 10:42.891
My friends.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.561
I see. And what are your
friends made of, Quasimodo?

10:46.646 --> 10:47.979
Stone.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.150
- Can stone talk?
- No, it can't.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.486
That's right. You're a smart lad.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.905
Now, lunch.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.579
Shall we review your alphabet today?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.499
Yes, Master.
I would like that very much.

11:07.583 --> 11:11.002
- Very well. "A"?
- Abomination.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.754
- "B"?
- Blasphemy.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.756
- "C"?
- Contrition.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.257
- "D"?
- Damnation.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.426
- "E"?
- Eternal damnation.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.261
- Good. "F"?
- Festival.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.599
- Excuse me?
- Forgiveness.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.185
- You said, "Festival."
- No!

11:27.269 --> 11:30.105
You are thinking
about going to the festival.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.399
It's just that you go every year.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.860
I am a public official. I must go.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.947
But I don't enjoy a moment.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.283
Thieves and cutpurses,
the dregs of humankind,

11:42.326 --> 11:46.871
all mixed together
in a shallow, drunken stupor.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.999
I didn't mean to upset you, Master.

11:50.084 --> 11:53.044
Quasimodo, can't you understand?

11:53.129 --> 11:56.297
When your heartless mother
abandoned you as a child,

11:56.382 --> 11:58.883
anyone else would have drowned you.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.637
And this is my thanks for taking you in
and raising you as my son?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.222
I'm sorry, sir.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.891
My dear Quasimodo.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.477
You don't know what it's like out there.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.731
I do. I do.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.316
The world is cruel

12:15.401 --> 12:17.569
The world is wicked

12:17.653 --> 12:21.573
It's I alone whom you can
trust in this whole city

12:21.657 --> 12:25.326
I am your only friend

12:26.662 --> 12:29.998
I, who keep you, teach you
feed you, dress you

12:30.750 --> 12:33.752
I, who look upon you without fear

12:34.920 --> 12:36.963
How can I protect you, boy

12:37.006 --> 12:41.092
Unless you always stay in here

12:41.177 --> 12:43.803
Away in here

12:44.346 --> 12:47.432
Remember what
I've taught you, Quasimodo.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.642
- You are deformed
- I am deformed

12:49.685 --> 12:51.853
- And you are ugly
- And I am ugly

12:51.896 --> 12:55.607
And these are crimes
for which the world shows little pity

12:55.691 --> 12:57.901
You do not comprehend

12:57.985 --> 13:00.820
You are my one defender

13:00.863 --> 13:03.573
Out there they'll
revile you as a monster

13:03.657 --> 13:05.200
I am a monster

13:05.284 --> 13:08.036
Out there they
will hate and scorn and jeer

13:08.120 --> 13:09.370
Only a monster

13:09.455 --> 13:13.500
Why invite their calumny
and consternation

13:13.626 --> 13:15.460
Stay in here

13:15.544 --> 13:18.129
- Be faithful to me
- I'm faithful

13:18.214 --> 13:21.216
- Grateful to me
- I'm grateful

13:21.300 --> 13:24.135
Do as I say

13:24.220 --> 13:25.720
Obey

13:25.805 --> 13:31.976
- And stay in here
- I'll stay in here

13:32.478 --> 13:35.063
You are good to me, Master.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.982
- I'm sorry.
- You are forgiven.

13:38.067 --> 13:42.237
But, remember, Quasimodo,
this is your sanctuary.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.490
My sanctuary.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.578
Safe behind these windows
and these parapets of stone

13:51.080 --> 13:54.499
Gazing at the people down below me

13:55.000 --> 13:58.920
All my life, I watch them
as I hide up here alone

13:59.255 --> 14:02.882
Hungry for the histories they show me

14:03.425 --> 14:07.262
All my life I memorize their faces

14:07.346 --> 14:11.432
Knowing them
as they will never know me

14:11.517 --> 14:15.186
All my life, I wonder
how it feels to pass a day

14:15.271 --> 14:17.605
Not above them

14:19.024 --> 14:23.111
But part of them

14:23.612 --> 14:26.614
And out there

14:26.699 --> 14:30.201
Living in the sun

14:30.286 --> 14:34.038
Give me one day out there

14:34.123 --> 14:37.458
All I ask is one

14:37.543 --> 14:39.961
To hold forever

14:40.004 --> 14:41.796
Out there

14:41.881 --> 14:46.467
Where they all live unaware

14:46.552 --> 14:48.761
What I'd give

14:50.222 --> 14:53.391
What I'd dare

14:54.059 --> 14:55.935
Just to live

14:55.978 --> 14:58.104
One day

14:58.147 --> 15:05.153
Out there

15:05.237 --> 15:09.490
Out there among the millers
and the weavers and their wives

15:09.575 --> 15:12.911
Through the roofs and gables
I can see them

15:12.995 --> 15:16.748
Every day they shout and scold
and go about their lives

15:16.832 --> 15:20.001
Heedless of the gift it is to be them

15:20.085 --> 15:24.130
If I was in their skin

15:24.173 --> 15:27.008
I'd treasure

15:27.051 --> 15:29.677
Every instant

15:29.720 --> 15:31.512
Out there

15:31.597 --> 15:35.266
Strolling by the Seine

15:35.351 --> 15:38.686
Taste the morning out there

15:38.771 --> 15:42.690
Like ordinary men

15:42.775 --> 15:46.527
Who freely walk about there

15:46.612 --> 15:50.114
Just one day and then

15:50.199 --> 15:55.453
I swear I'll be content

15:55.537 --> 15:59.040
With my share

15:59.124 --> 16:02.627
Won't resent
Won't despair

16:02.711 --> 16:06.297
Old and bent
I won't care

16:06.382 --> 16:11.719
I'll have spent
One day

16:11.762 --> 16:18.768
Out there

16:41.250 --> 16:45.586
You leave town for a couple of decades,
and they change everything.

16:45.671 --> 16:49.757
Excuse me, gentlemen, I'm looking for
the palace ofjustice. Would you...

16:49.842 --> 16:51.259
I guess not.

16:59.518 --> 17:04.022
Stay away, child. They're gypsies.
They'll steal us blind.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.252
All right, gypsy.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.255
- Where'd ya get the money?
- For your information, I earned it.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.633
- Gypsies don't earn money.
- They steal it.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.510
You'd know a lot about stealing.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.220
Troublemaker, eh?

17:36.305 --> 17:39.474
Maybe a day in the stocks
will cool ya down.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.646
Come back here, gypsy!

17:48.400 --> 17:49.484
Achilles, sit.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.863
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.740
Naughty horse! Naughty!

17:55.824 --> 17:58.993
He's just impossible.
Really, I can't take him anywhere.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.163
Get this thing off me!

18:02.289 --> 18:04.999
I'll teach you a lesson, peasant!

18:06.085 --> 18:08.419
You were saying, Lieutenant?

18:09.254 --> 18:10.922
Captain!

18:12.674 --> 18:14.425
At your service, sir!

18:16.261 --> 18:18.262
I know you have a lot
on your mind right now,

18:18.347 --> 18:20.890
but the palace ofjustice?

18:20.974 --> 18:24.310
- Make way for the captain!
- Go on, make way!

18:24.353 --> 18:25.645
Make way!

18:26.605 --> 18:29.857
- Everybody out of the way!
- You, make way for the captain!

18:29.942 --> 18:32.276
- Make way!
- Make way, now!

18:37.366 --> 18:39.575
Come on, boy. Achilles, heel!

18:57.052 --> 18:58.886
- Stop.
- Sir?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.556
Ease up. Wait between lashes.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.308
Otherwise the old sting
will dull him to the new.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.643
Yes, sir.

19:05.727 --> 19:10.398
So this is the gallant Captain Phoebus,
home from the wars.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.233
Reporting for duty, as ordered, sir.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.069
Your service record
precedes you, Phoebus.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.739
I expect nothing but the best
from a war hero of your calibre.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.783
And you shall have it, sir. I guarantee it.

19:20.868 --> 19:21.951
Yes.

19:22.077 --> 19:26.706
You know, my last captain of the guard
was a bit of a disappointment to me.

19:28.167 --> 19:32.003
Well, no matter.
I'm sure you'll whip my men into shape.

19:33.088 --> 19:36.674
Thank you.
It's a tremendous honour, sir.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.427
You've come to Paris
in her darkest hour, Captain.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.180
It will take a firm hand
to save the weak-minded

19:42.264 --> 19:45.516
- from being so easily misled.
- Misled, sir?

19:45.601 --> 19:47.852
Look, Captain. Gypsies.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.521
The gypsies live outside
the normal order.

19:50.606 --> 19:54.442
Their heathen ways inflame
the people's lowest instincts.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.278
And they must be stopped.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.030
I was summoned from the wars

19:59.114 --> 20:01.115
to capture fortune tellers
and palm readers?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.702
The real war, Captain,
is what you see before you.

20:04.786 --> 20:09.081
For 20 years, I have been
taking care of the gypsies,

20:09.124 --> 20:11.709
one by one.

20:12.377 --> 20:16.380
And yet, for all my success,
they have thrived.

20:16.465 --> 20:20.885
I believe they have a safe haven
within the walls of this very city.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.054
A nest, if you will.

20:23.138 --> 20:26.307
They call it the court of miracles.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.101
What are we going to do about it, sir?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.397
You make your point quite vividly, sir.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.484
You know, I like you, Captain. Shall we?

20:39.404 --> 20:40.738
Duty calls.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.491
Have you ever attended
a peasant festival, Captain?

20:43.575 --> 20:45.117
Not recently, sir.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.245
Then this should be
quite an education for you.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.329
Come along.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.343
Come, one

21:02.761 --> 21:04.512
Come, all

21:04.596 --> 21:06.639
Leave your looms and milking stools

21:06.682 --> 21:09.433
Coop the hens and pen the mules

21:09.518 --> 21:11.352
Come, one

21:11.436 --> 21:13.437
Come, all

21:13.522 --> 21:15.648
Close the churches and the schools

21:15.691 --> 21:17.942
It's the day for breaking rules

21:18.026 --> 21:24.532
Come and join the Feast Of Fools

21:28.787 --> 21:32.498
Once a year we throw
a party here in town

21:32.541 --> 21:35.876
Once a year we turn
all Paris upside-down

21:35.961 --> 21:39.297
Every man's a king
and every king's a clown

21:39.381 --> 21:42.550
Once again it's topsy-turvy day

21:42.634 --> 21:45.970
It's the day the devil in us gets released

21:46.054 --> 21:49.307
It's the day we mock the prig
and shock the priest

21:49.391 --> 21:54.186
Everything is topsy-turvy
at the Feast of Fools

21:54.229 --> 21:55.938
Topsy-turvy

21:56.023 --> 21:59.191
- Everything is upsy-daisy
- Topsy-turvy

21:59.234 --> 22:01.068
Everyone is acting crazy

22:01.111 --> 22:04.238
Dross is gold and weeds are a bouquet

22:04.323 --> 22:07.408
That's the way on topsy-turvy day

22:09.328 --> 22:11.495
Hey! Are you all right?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.415
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.001
Well, you're not hurt, are you?
Here, here, let's see.

22:17.085 --> 22:19.170
- No, no! No!
- There.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.630
See? No harm done.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.508
Just try to be a little more careful.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.427
I will.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.513
By the way, great mask.

22:32.934 --> 22:36.270
- Topsy-turvy
- Beat the drums and blow the trumpets

22:36.313 --> 22:37.980
Topsy-turvy

22:38.065 --> 22:39.607
Join the bums
and thieves and strumpets

22:39.691 --> 22:42.943
Streaming in from Chartres to Calais

22:43.028 --> 22:46.364
Scurvy knaves are extra scurvy
on the sixth of Januervy

22:46.448 --> 22:50.117
All because it's topsy-turvy day

22:50.619 --> 22:52.370
Come, one

22:52.621 --> 22:54.622
Come, all

22:54.706 --> 22:56.707
Hurry, hurry
Here's your chance

22:56.792 --> 22:59.668
See the mystery and romance

22:59.753 --> 23:03.464
Come, one
Come, all

23:03.548 --> 23:06.050
See the finest girl in France

23:06.134 --> 23:08.260
Make an entrance to entrance

23:08.303 --> 23:13.933
Dance la Esmeralda

23:13.975 --> 23:15.476
Dance

23:20.899 --> 23:24.318
- Look at that disgusting display.
- Yes, sir.

23:51.012 --> 23:55.933
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the pièce de résistance!

23:56.017 --> 23:59.687
Here it is
The moment you've been waiting for

23:59.729 --> 24:03.190
Here it is
You know exactly what's in store

24:03.275 --> 24:06.527
Now's the time we laugh
until our sides get sore

24:06.611 --> 24:09.530
Now's the time
we crown the king of fools

24:09.614 --> 24:12.283
You all remember last year's king

24:12.951 --> 24:16.871
So make a face that's
horrible and frightening

24:16.955 --> 24:19.665
Make a face that's gruesome
as a gargoyle's wing

24:19.708 --> 24:20.708
Hey!

24:20.792 --> 24:24.545
For the face that's ugliest
will be the king of fools

24:24.588 --> 24:25.588
Why?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.047
Topsy-turvy

24:27.090 --> 24:30.217
- Ugly folks forget your shyness
- Topsy-turvy

24:30.302 --> 24:32.178
You could soon be called
your highness

24:32.220 --> 24:35.431
Put your foulest features on display

24:35.515 --> 24:38.559
Be the king of topsy-turvy day

24:51.406 --> 24:53.824
- That's no mask.
- It's his face!

24:53.909 --> 24:55.242
He's hideous!

24:55.327 --> 24:58.162
It's the bell ringer from Notre Dame!

25:05.003 --> 25:07.463
Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic.

25:07.547 --> 25:11.926
We asked for the ugliest face in Paris,
and here it is!

25:12.010 --> 25:16.180
Quasimodo,
the hunchback of Notre Dame!

25:16.264 --> 25:21.852
Everybody!

25:21.937 --> 25:26.065
Once a year we throw a party

25:26.107 --> 25:29.193
- Here in town
- Hail to the king

25:29.277 --> 25:32.947
Once a year
we turn all Paris upside-down

25:32.989 --> 25:34.782
What a king

25:34.866 --> 25:36.867
Once a year
the ugliest will wear a crown

25:36.952 --> 25:39.286
Girls, give a kiss.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.038
We never had a king like this

25:41.122 --> 25:44.625
And it's the day we do
the things that we deplore

25:44.709 --> 25:48.087
On the other three hundred
and sixty-four

25:48.129 --> 25:51.340
Once a year we love to drop in
where the beer is never stopping

25:51.424 --> 25:54.218
For the chance to pop some popinjay

25:54.302 --> 25:56.303
And pick a king who put the "top"

25:56.346 --> 25:59.723
In topsy-turvy

25:59.808 --> 26:03.185
Topsy-turvy
Mad-and-crazy upsy-daisy

26:03.270 --> 26:06.272
Topsy-turvy day

26:11.403 --> 26:14.655
Quasimodo! Quasimodo!

26:14.739 --> 26:17.032
You think he's ugly now? Watch this.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.993
Quasimodo!

26:22.664 --> 26:23.914
Now that's ugly!

26:25.667 --> 26:27.793
Hail to the king!

26:30.088 --> 26:31.755
Bon appétit!

26:35.760 --> 26:39.513
- Where are you goin', hunchback?
- The fun's just beginning.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.293
Master!

27:10.629 --> 27:13.047
Master, please, help me!

27:17.636 --> 27:20.304
Sir, request permission
to stop this cruelty.

27:20.388 --> 27:24.600
In a moment, Captain.
A lesson needs to be learned here.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.533
Don't be afraid.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.661
I'm sorry.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.664
This wasn't supposed to happen.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.793
You! Gypsy girl!

27:51.211 --> 27:52.961
Get down at once!

27:53.046 --> 27:56.298
Yes, your honour.
Just as soon as I free this poor creature.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.466
I forbid it!

27:59.678 --> 28:02.513
How dare you defy me?

28:02.597 --> 28:05.849
You mistreat this poor boy
the same way you mistreat my people.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.687
You speak ofjustice, yet you are cruel
to those most in need of your help.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.772
- Silence!
- Justice!

28:16.945 --> 28:20.906
Mark my words, gypsy.
You will pay for this insolence.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.701
Then it appears
we've crowned the wrong fool.

28:23.785 --> 28:26.328
The only fool I see is you!

28:29.165 --> 28:31.291
Captain Phoebus, arrest her.

28:35.463 --> 28:36.463
Now, let's see.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.632
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.886
So there's ten of you and one of me.
What's a poor girl to do?

28:47.642 --> 28:49.309
Witchcraft!

28:49.394 --> 28:52.271
Oh, boys. Over here.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.482
- There she is!
- Get her!

29:30.351 --> 29:32.019
I'm free! I'm free!

29:33.605 --> 29:34.605
Dang it.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.372
What a woman.

30:21.069 --> 30:24.571
Find her, Captain. I want her alive.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.698
Yes, sir. Seal off the area, men.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.867
Find the gypsy girl
and do not harm her.

30:38.753 --> 30:43.215
I'm sorry, Master.
I will never disobey you again.

30:46.052 --> 30:48.428
Stand back. Stand back.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.808
Oh, he's hideous.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.964
You, there, get away! Move on.

31:52.535 --> 31:53.619
You!

31:53.661 --> 31:55.746
Easy, easy. I just shaved this morning.

31:55.830 --> 31:58.624
- Oh, really? You missed a spot.
- All right, all right.

31:58.666 --> 32:01.376
Just calm down.
Just give me a chance to apologize.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.171
- For what?
- That, for example.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.548
You sneaky son of a...

32:06.633 --> 32:08.675
Watch it. You're in a church.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.887
Are you always this charming,
or am I just lucky?

32:14.098 --> 32:17.017
Candlelight, privacy, music.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.436
Can't think of a better place
for hand-to-hand combat.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.105
You fight almost as well as a man.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.108
Funny, I was going to say
the same thing about you.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.194
That's hitting a little below the belt,
don't you think?

32:27.278 --> 32:28.737
No. This is.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.700
Touché.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.537
- I didn't know you had a kid.
- Well, he doesn't take kindly to soldiers.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.665
I noticed.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.541
Permit me.

32:41.626 --> 32:45.045
I'm Phoebus. It means "sun god."

32:47.715 --> 32:50.634
- And you are?
- Is this an interrogation?

32:51.177 --> 32:53.053
I believe it's called an introduction.

32:53.096 --> 32:56.723
- You're not arresting me?
- Not as long as you're in here. I can't.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.726
You're not at all like the other soldiers.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.061
Thank you.

33:01.104 --> 33:05.357
So, if you're not going to arrest me,
what do you want?

33:05.400 --> 33:07.109
I'd settle for your name.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.737
- Esmeralda.
- Beautiful.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.701
Much better than Phoebus, anyway.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.917
Good work, Captain. Now arrest her.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.295
Claim "sanctuary."

33:29.090 --> 33:31.508
- Say it!
- You tricked me.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.760
I'm waiting, Captain.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.304
I'm sorry, sir. She claimed sanctuary.

33:36.389 --> 33:37.764
There's nothing I can do.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.267
Then drag her outside and...

33:40.309 --> 33:43.729
Frollo, you will not touch her!
Don't worry.

33:43.771 --> 33:48.358
Minister Frollo learned years ago
to respect the sanctity of the church.

33:58.786 --> 34:00.037
All right, all right. I'm going.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.792
You think you've outwitted me.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.878
But I'm a patient man.

34:07.962 --> 34:12.299
And gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.762
What are you doing?

34:16.804 --> 34:21.475
I was just imagining a rope
around that beautiful neck.

34:21.559 --> 34:24.603
I know what you were imagining.

34:24.645 --> 34:26.146
Such a clever witch.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.899
So typical of your kind to twist the truth.

34:28.983 --> 34:32.235
To cloud the mind with unholy thoughts.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.196
Well, no matter.

34:35.156 --> 34:38.075
You've chosen a magnificent prison.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.994
But it is a prison, nonetheless.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.748
Set one foot outside, and you're mine.

34:52.006 --> 34:54.341
Frollo's orders.
Post a guard at every door.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.346
Don't worry, Djali.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.598
If Frollo thinks he can keep us here,
he's wrong.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.391
Don't act rashly, my child.

35:03.476 --> 35:06.978
You created quite a stir at the festival.

35:07.021 --> 35:10.190
It would be unwise to arouse
Frollo's anger further.

35:10.233 --> 35:14.027
You saw what he did out there,
letting the crowd torture that poor boy.

35:14.070 --> 35:17.823
I thought ifjust one person
could stand up to him, then...

35:19.408 --> 35:21.827
What do they have against people
who are different, anyway?

35:21.869 --> 35:25.539
You can't right
all the wrongs of this world by yourself.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.874
No one out there is going to help,
that's for sure.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.878
Well, perhaps there's
someone in here who can.

35:51.065 --> 35:54.401
I don't know if You can hear me

35:54.485 --> 35:57.904
Or if You're even there

35:57.947 --> 36:01.950
I don't know if You would listen

36:02.034 --> 36:05.912
To a gypsy's prayer

36:05.997 --> 36:09.624
Yes, I know I'm just an outcast

36:09.709 --> 36:13.920
I shouldn't speak to You

36:14.005 --> 36:18.925
Still, I see your face and wonder

36:19.010 --> 36:25.765
Were You once an outcast, too?

36:31.105 --> 36:35.025
God help the outcasts

36:35.109 --> 36:37.944
Hungry from birth

36:37.987 --> 36:42.032
Show them the mercy

36:42.116 --> 36:46.077
They don't find on earth

36:46.120 --> 36:49.247
God help my people

36:49.290 --> 36:53.251
We look to You still

36:53.294 --> 36:56.963
God help the outcasts

36:57.048 --> 37:00.508
Or nobody will

37:02.053 --> 37:05.222
I ask for wealth

37:05.306 --> 37:08.099
I ask for fame

37:08.142 --> 37:11.311
I ask for glory

37:11.354 --> 37:15.315
To shine on my name

37:15.358 --> 37:19.110
I ask for love

37:19.153 --> 37:22.697
I can possess

37:22.782 --> 37:26.868
I ask for God and His angels

37:26.953 --> 37:31.039
To bless me

37:31.123 --> 37:34.668
I ask for nothing

37:34.752 --> 37:37.796
I can get by

37:37.838 --> 37:41.633
But I know so many

37:41.676 --> 37:45.262
Less lucky than I

37:45.346 --> 37:48.765
Please help my people

37:48.849 --> 37:52.727
The poor and downtrod

37:52.812 --> 37:56.856
I thought we all were

37:56.941 --> 38:01.403
The children of God

38:02.905 --> 38:08.159
God help the outcasts

38:08.202 --> 38:12.872
Children of

38:12.915 --> 38:19.921
God

38:34.895 --> 38:37.689
You! Bell ringer!
What are you doing down here?

38:39.191 --> 38:41.401
Haven't you caused
enough trouble already?

38:41.444 --> 38:42.527
Wait.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.322
I want to talk to you.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.908
Look, he's got a friend with him.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.494
Yeah. Maybe today wasn't
a total loss after all.

38:51.579 --> 38:54.205
- A vision of loveliness.
- The one in the dress ain't bad either.

38:54.248 --> 38:56.166
- Way to go, Quasi!
- Congratulations.

38:56.250 --> 38:59.085
- We knew you had it in ya.
- Got the girls chasin' ya already.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.170
Actually, I...

39:00.254 --> 39:02.172
You mustn't run too fast,
or she'll get away.

39:02.256 --> 39:03.673
Yes, I know. That's what I...

39:03.758 --> 39:05.425
Give her some slack, then reel her in.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.260
Then give her some slack,
then reel her in.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.429
- Then give her some slack...
- Knock it off, Hugo.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.598
She's a girl, not a mackerel.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.684
Here you are. I was afraid I'd lost you.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.936
Yes. Well, I...

39:17.438 --> 39:22.609
I have chores to do.
It was nice seeing you again.

39:23.652 --> 39:24.861
No, wait!

39:28.783 --> 39:31.951
I'm really sorry about this afternoon.
I had no idea who you were.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.162
I would never in my life
have pulled you...

39:35.623 --> 39:37.707
Up on the...

39:39.543 --> 39:41.086
Stage.

39:43.422 --> 39:46.549
- What is this place?
- This is where I live.

39:46.634 --> 39:49.344
Did you make all these things yourself?

39:49.428 --> 39:50.595
Most of them.

39:50.638 --> 39:51.930
This is beautiful.

39:51.972 --> 39:55.350
If I could do this, you wouldn't find me
dancing in the streets for coins.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.268
But you're a wonderful dancer.

39:57.311 --> 40:00.480
It keeps bread on the table, anyway.
What's this?

40:00.940 --> 40:03.108
No, please! I'm not finished.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.776
I still have to paint them.

40:04.819 --> 40:08.321
It's the blacksmith and the baker!

40:11.700 --> 40:14.744
You're a surprising person, Quasimodo.

40:14.829 --> 40:18.164
Not to mention lucky.
All this room to yourself.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.166
Well, it's not just me.

40:20.209 --> 40:24.504
There's the gargoyles
and, of course, the bells.

40:24.588 --> 40:28.091
- Would you like to see them?
- Yes, of course. Wouldn't we, Djali?

40:30.177 --> 40:32.387
Follow me. I'll introduce you.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.724
- I never knew there were so many.
- That's Little Sophia.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.144
And Jeane-Marie,
Anne-Marie, Louise-Marie.

40:39.186 --> 40:40.478
Triplets, you know.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.689
- And who's this?
- Big Marie.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.357
Hello!

40:46.277 --> 40:48.862
She likes you.
Would you like to see more?

40:48.946 --> 40:50.196
How about it, Djali?

40:51.949 --> 40:53.992
- We'd love to.
- Good.

40:54.034 --> 40:56.327
I've saved the best for last.

41:07.214 --> 41:10.550
I bet the king himself
doesn't have a view like this.

41:10.593 --> 41:14.345
- I could stay up here forever.
- You could, you know.

41:14.388 --> 41:15.763
No, I couldn't.

41:15.848 --> 41:18.892
- Oh, yes, you have sanctuary.
- But not freedom.

41:18.934 --> 41:21.603
"Gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls."

41:21.687 --> 41:26.274
But you're not like other gypsies.
They are evil.

41:26.358 --> 41:29.360
- Who told you that?
- My master, Frollo.

41:29.403 --> 41:30.570
He raised me.

41:30.654 --> 41:33.281
How can such a cruel man have
raised someone like you?

41:33.365 --> 41:35.200
Cruel? Oh, no.

41:35.242 --> 41:38.578
He saved my life.
He took me in when no one else would.

41:38.704 --> 41:41.664
- I am a monster, you know.
- He told you that?

41:41.749 --> 41:43.416
Look at me.

41:44.585 --> 41:47.086
- Give me your hand. Just let me see it.
- What?

41:49.131 --> 41:50.632
A long lifeline.

41:50.716 --> 41:53.384
And this one means you're shy.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.640
- Well, that's funny.
- What?

41:58.724 --> 42:01.100
- I don't see any...
- Any what?

42:01.185 --> 42:04.103
Monster lines. Not a single one.

42:05.314 --> 42:08.149
Now you look at me.
Do you think I'm evil?

42:08.234 --> 42:12.654
No! No, no.
You are kind and good and...

42:12.738 --> 42:16.991
And a gypsy. And maybe Frollo's wrong
about the both of us.

42:17.326 --> 42:18.326
What did she say?

42:18.410 --> 42:20.578
Frollo's nose is long,
and he wears a truss.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.288
Told ya! Pay up.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.123
- Oh, dear.
- Chump.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.338
You helped me. Now I will help you.

42:30.422 --> 42:33.132
But there's no way out.
There are soldiers at every door.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.009
We won't use a door.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.470
- You mean, climb down?
- Sure.

42:37.513 --> 42:40.723
- You carry him. I carry you.
- Okay.

42:42.309 --> 42:43.851
Come on, Djali.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.105
- Ready?
- Yes.

42:47.147 --> 42:49.023
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

42:50.067 --> 42:53.319
- Now I'm afraid.
- The trick is not to look down.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.701
You've done this before?

42:59.785 --> 43:00.952
No.

43:12.172 --> 43:13.798
Wow, you're quite an acrobat.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.091
Thank you.

43:24.184 --> 43:26.269
- Check the alley!
- This way!

43:37.948 --> 43:40.783
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- Not for an instant.

43:41.869 --> 43:43.703
I'll never forget you, Esmeralda.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.706
- Come with me.
- What?

43:46.749 --> 43:48.166
To the court of miracles.
Leave this place.

43:48.208 --> 43:49.250
Oh, no.

43:49.335 --> 43:52.128
I'm never going back out there again.
You saw what happened today.

43:52.212 --> 43:55.048
No. This is where I belong.

43:55.090 --> 43:57.050
All right, then I'll come to see you.

43:57.134 --> 44:01.220
- Here? But the soldiers and Frollo!
- I'll come after sunset.

44:01.263 --> 44:05.016
But at sunset, I ring the evening mass,
and after that I clean the cloisters.

44:05.059 --> 44:08.561
And then I ring the vespers, and...
Whatever is good for you.

44:08.646 --> 44:12.649
If you ever need sanctuary,
this will show you the way.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.567
- But how?
- Just remember.

44:14.652 --> 44:18.655
When you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand.

44:24.286 --> 44:25.495
Hurry. You must go.

44:25.579 --> 44:27.330
Check the alley.

44:27.414 --> 44:30.875
Yes, sir. No one here, sir.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.251
No one here, sir.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.295
Check the street.

44:40.260 --> 44:41.344
Hi, there.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.555
I'm looking for the gypsy girl.
Have you seen her?

44:44.598 --> 44:48.726
- Whoa, whoa! Easy!
- No soldiers! Sanctuary! Get out!

44:48.811 --> 44:50.603
- Wait! All I want is to...
- Go!

44:50.646 --> 44:52.438
I mean her no harm.

44:53.399 --> 44:54.607
Go!

44:57.695 --> 45:00.947
You tell her for me,
I didn't mean to trap her here.

45:00.989 --> 45:03.741
But it was the only way
I could save her life.

45:03.784 --> 45:07.286
Will you tell her that? Will you?

45:07.371 --> 45:09.664
If you go. Now.

45:09.748 --> 45:11.958
I'll go.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.461
Now, will you put me down, please?

45:22.469 --> 45:24.637
And one more thing.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.974
- Tell Esmeralda she's very lucky.
- Why?

45:28.016 --> 45:30.184
To have a friend like you.

45:36.316 --> 45:38.192
Hey, there he is.

45:41.822 --> 45:45.324
You ejected that tin-plated buffoon
with great panache.

45:45.367 --> 45:48.286
The nerve of him, snoopin' around here,
tryin' to steal your girl.

45:48.328 --> 45:50.413
- My girl?
- Esmeralda.

45:50.497 --> 45:52.749
Dark hair,
works with a goat, remember?

45:52.833 --> 45:55.126
Boy, I do. Way to go, lover boy.

45:55.169 --> 45:57.545
"Lover boy"? Oh, no, no, no, no.

45:57.629 --> 45:59.255
Don't be so modest.

45:59.673 --> 46:02.467
Look, I appreciate
what you're all trying to do.

46:02.509 --> 46:06.763
But let's not fool ourselves.
"Ugliest face in all Paris," remember?

46:08.182 --> 46:10.266
I don't think I'm her type.

46:12.186 --> 46:16.606
So many times out there
I've watched a happy pair

46:16.690 --> 46:20.860
Of lovers walking in the night

46:21.695 --> 46:26.532
They had a kind of glow around them

46:26.575 --> 46:31.037
It almost looked like heaven's light

46:32.456 --> 46:34.874
I knew I'd never know

46:34.958 --> 46:37.210
That warm and loving glow

46:37.294 --> 46:42.048
Though I might wish with all my might

46:42.090 --> 46:47.094
No face as hideous as my face

46:47.179 --> 46:52.391
Was ever meant for heaven's light

46:52.434 --> 46:56.771
But suddenly an angel has
smiled at me

46:56.855 --> 47:01.692
And kissed my cheek
without a trace of fright

47:03.862 --> 47:06.072
I dare to dream that she

47:06.114 --> 47:08.199
Might even care for me

47:08.242 --> 47:12.703
And as I ring these bells tonight

47:13.622 --> 47:19.293
My cold dark tower seems so bright

47:19.378 --> 47:24.257
I swear it must be heaven's light

47:44.278 --> 47:47.613
Confiteor Deo

47:47.698 --> 47:51.993
Omnipotenti

47:52.953 --> 47:57.206
Beatae Mariae

47:57.291 --> 48:02.628
Semper Virgini

48:02.713 --> 48:09.135
Beato Michaeli archangelo

48:09.177 --> 48:13.264
Sanctis apostolis

48:13.307 --> 48:15.308
Omnibus

48:15.350 --> 48:20.938
Sanctis

48:23.358 --> 48:26.444
Beata Maria

48:26.486 --> 48:29.780
You know I am a righteous man

48:29.823 --> 48:35.286
- Of my virtue I am justly proud
- Et tibit Pater

48:35.329 --> 48:37.997
Beata Maria

48:38.081 --> 48:40.875
You know I'm so much purer than

48:40.959 --> 48:44.378
The common, vulgar, weak
licentious crowd

48:44.463 --> 48:46.339
Quia peccavi nimis

48:46.381 --> 48:49.008
Then tell me, Maria

48:49.092 --> 48:52.011
Why I see her dancing there

48:52.054 --> 48:55.848
Why her smouldering eyes
still scorch my soul

48:55.933 --> 48:57.850
Cogitatione

48:57.935 --> 49:00.519
I feel her, I see her

49:00.604 --> 49:03.731
The sun caught in her raven hair

49:03.815 --> 49:07.360
Is blazing in me out of all control

49:07.402 --> 49:09.862
Verbo et opere

49:09.947 --> 49:12.156
Like fire

49:12.199 --> 49:15.076
Hellfire

49:15.160 --> 49:19.705
This fire in my skin

49:19.790 --> 49:24.251
This burning desire

49:24.336 --> 49:29.215
Is turning me to sin

49:31.385 --> 49:33.344
- It's not my fault
- Mea culpa

49:33.387 --> 49:35.388
- I'm not to blame
- Mea culpa

49:35.430 --> 49:37.848
It is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame

49:37.891 --> 49:39.266
Mea maxima culpa

49:39.351 --> 49:42.061
- It's not my fault if in God's plan
- Mea culpa

49:42.145 --> 49:43.145
Mea Culpa

49:43.230 --> 49:48.734
He made the devil so much
stronger than a man

49:48.777 --> 49:51.404
Protect me, Maria

49:51.446 --> 49:54.198
Don't let this siren cast her spell

49:54.241 --> 49:59.370
Don't let her fire
sear my flesh and bone

49:59.413 --> 50:02.123
Destroy Esmeralda

50:02.207 --> 50:05.084
And let her taste the fires of hell

50:05.127 --> 50:10.047
Or else let her be mine and mine alone

50:12.676 --> 50:15.386
Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.930
- What?
- She's nowhere in the cathedral.

50:18.015 --> 50:22.727
- She's gone.
- But how? Never mind.

50:22.769 --> 50:25.855
Get out, you idiot. I'll find her.

50:25.939 --> 50:29.442
I'll find her if I have to
burn down all of Paris.

50:30.360 --> 50:34.613
Hellfire
Dark fire

50:34.698 --> 50:38.284
Now, gypsy
It's your turn

50:39.119 --> 50:43.622
Choose me or your pyre

50:43.707 --> 50:48.836
Be mine or you will burn

50:48.920 --> 50:55.009
- Kyrie eleison
- God have mercy on her

50:55.093 --> 51:00.723
- Kyrie eleison
- God have mercy on me

51:00.807 --> 51:05.811
- Kyrie eleison
- But she will be mine

51:05.854 --> 51:09.106
Or she

51:09.149 --> 51:11.692
Will

51:11.777 --> 51:18.783
Burn

51:27.959 --> 51:29.210
'Tention!

51:31.755 --> 51:32.755
Good morning, sir.

51:34.257 --> 51:38.636
- Are you feeling all right?
- I had a little trouble with the fireplace.

51:38.678 --> 51:42.431
- I see. Your orders, sir?
- Find the gypsy girl.

51:48.939 --> 51:53.317
Ten pieces of silver
for the gypsy, Esmeralda.

51:56.029 --> 51:57.029
Lock them up.

52:04.121 --> 52:07.790
Twenty pieces of silver
for the gypsy, Esmeralda.

52:08.875 --> 52:10.209
Take them away!

52:19.970 --> 52:22.721
- Poor miller.
- He's never harmed anyone!

52:22.806 --> 52:24.723
Frollo's gone mad.

52:24.808 --> 52:27.726
We found this gypsy talisman
on your property.

52:27.811 --> 52:29.228
Have you been harbouring gypsies?

52:29.312 --> 52:31.772
Our home is always open
to the weary traveller.

52:31.898 --> 52:33.399
Have mercy, my lord.

52:33.483 --> 52:35.985
I am placing you and your family
under house arrest

52:36.069 --> 52:37.278
until I get to the bottom of this.

52:37.362 --> 52:39.196
If what you say is true
and you are innocent,

52:39.239 --> 52:40.447
then you have nothing to fear.

52:40.532 --> 52:45.077
But we are innocent. I assure you,
we know nothing of these gypsies.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.209
- Burn it.
- What?

52:53.336 --> 52:54.795
Until it smoulders.

52:54.880 --> 52:57.673
These people are traitors
and must be made examples of.

52:57.757 --> 53:01.260
With all due respect, sir, I was
not trained to murder the innocent.

53:01.344 --> 53:04.430
But you were trained to follow orders.

53:10.478 --> 53:12.438
Insolent coward.

53:42.302 --> 53:45.221
The sentence
for insubordination is death.

53:45.305 --> 53:49.558
Such a pity.
You threw away a promising career.

53:49.643 --> 53:52.228
Consider it my highest honour, sir.

54:01.738 --> 54:04.490
Get him! And don't hit my horse!

54:15.669 --> 54:19.630
Don't waste your arrows.
Let the traitor rot in his watery grave.

54:20.006 --> 54:21.257
Find the girl.

54:21.341 --> 54:25.261
If you have to burn the city
to the ground, so be it.

54:41.027 --> 54:51.036
Kyrie eleison

54:51.121 --> 54:54.206
Sir, we've looked everywhere
and still no sign of the gypsy girl.

54:54.791 --> 54:58.043
I had the entire cathedral surrounded.

54:58.128 --> 55:02.131
Guards at every door. There was
no way she could have escaped.

55:02.882 --> 55:04.216
Unless...

55:10.557 --> 55:12.641
It doesn't look good.

55:12.726 --> 55:16.645
- It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless.
- You're tellin' me.

55:16.730 --> 55:18.230
I'm losin' to a bird!

55:18.315 --> 55:21.734
But that poor gypsy girl.
I'm beginning to fear the worst.

55:21.818 --> 55:25.321
I know. But now don't you say
anything to upset Quasimodo.

55:25.405 --> 55:26.947
He's worried enough already.

55:27.032 --> 55:28.615
Yeah, you're right. We better lighten up.

55:28.700 --> 55:31.076
- Here he comes.
- Now just stay calm.

55:31.161 --> 55:32.494
- Not a word.
- Easy does it.

55:32.579 --> 55:35.247
- Stone-faced.
- Any sign of her?

55:37.167 --> 55:40.794
It's a lost cause!
She could be anywhere!

55:40.879 --> 55:44.548
In the stocks,
in the dungeon, on the rack!

55:45.759 --> 55:49.595
- Nice work, Victor.
- No, he's right. What are we gonna do?

55:49.679 --> 55:51.221
What are you guys talkin' about?

55:51.264 --> 55:52.431
If I know Esmeralda,

55:52.474 --> 55:55.768
she's three steps ahead of Frollo
and well out of harm's way.

55:55.852 --> 55:56.852
Do you really think so?

55:56.936 --> 56:00.314
Hey, when things cool off,
she'll be back. You'll see.

56:00.398 --> 56:03.025
- What makes you so sure?
- Because she likes ya.

56:03.109 --> 56:04.777
We always said you were the cute one.

56:04.861 --> 56:06.278
I thought I was the cute one.

56:06.363 --> 56:09.114
No, you're the fat, stupid one
with the big mouth!

56:09.783 --> 56:11.241
What are you sayin', exactly?

56:11.576 --> 56:14.953
Take it from us, Quasi.
You got nothin' to worry about.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.622
Yeah. You're irresistible.

56:17.207 --> 56:19.708
Knights in shining armour
certainly aren't her type.

56:19.793 --> 56:22.086
And those guys are a dime a dozen.

56:22.128 --> 56:26.465
But you, you're one of a kind. Look.

56:26.549 --> 56:31.553
Paris, the city of lovers
is glowing this evening

56:33.723 --> 56:36.308
True, that's because it's on fire

56:36.351 --> 56:40.354
But still there's I'amour

56:41.898 --> 56:44.733
Somewhere out there in the night

56:45.402 --> 56:48.404
Her heart is also alight

56:48.488 --> 56:55.160
And I know the guy
she just might be burning for

56:56.496 --> 56:59.832
A guy like you

57:00.417 --> 57:03.210
She's never known, kid

57:03.294 --> 57:04.503
A guy like you

57:04.546 --> 57:07.840
A girl does not meet every day

57:07.924 --> 57:10.134
You've got a look

57:10.343 --> 57:14.388
That's all your own, kid
Could there be two?

57:14.472 --> 57:17.558
Like you?
No way

57:17.642 --> 57:20.185
Those other guys

57:20.228 --> 57:22.438
That she could dangle

57:22.522 --> 57:27.276
All look the same from every
boring point of view

57:27.360 --> 57:29.778
You're a surprise

57:29.863 --> 57:32.030
From every angle

57:32.115 --> 57:36.535
Mon Dieu above
She's gotta love a guy like you

57:36.619 --> 57:38.954
A guy like you

57:39.038 --> 57:41.457
Gets extra credit

57:41.541 --> 57:45.127
Because it's true you've got
a certain something more

57:45.211 --> 57:46.295
You're aces, kid.

57:46.379 --> 57:50.048
You see that face
Ya don't forget it

57:50.800 --> 57:52.384
Want something new

57:52.469 --> 57:53.510
That's you.

57:53.553 --> 57:55.888
For sure

57:55.972 --> 58:00.309
We all have gaped at some Adonis

58:00.393 --> 58:05.063
But then we crave a meal
more nourishing to chew

58:05.106 --> 58:07.399
And since you're shaped

58:07.484 --> 58:09.651
Like a croissant is

58:09.736 --> 58:14.406
No question of
she's gotta love a guy like you

58:17.160 --> 58:19.786
Call me a hopeless romantic

58:19.871 --> 58:22.414
But Quasi
I feel it

58:24.501 --> 58:26.043
She wants you so

58:26.085 --> 58:30.422
Any moment she'll walk
through that door

58:30.507 --> 58:32.758
For

58:32.842 --> 58:35.552
A guy so swell

58:35.595 --> 58:39.306
A guy like you with all you bring her

58:39.390 --> 58:42.351
A fool could tell it's why she fell

58:42.435 --> 58:44.770
For you-know-who

58:44.812 --> 58:47.022
You'll ring the bell

58:47.106 --> 58:50.067
You're the bell ringer

58:50.443 --> 58:54.446
When she wants ooh-la-la
And she wants you-la-la

58:54.531 --> 58:56.615
She will discover, guy

58:56.699 --> 58:58.784
You're one heck of a guy

58:58.826 --> 59:02.120
Who wouldn't love a guy

59:02.163 --> 59:03.664
Like You

59:03.748 --> 59:05.332
- You got a lot
- The rest have not

59:05.416 --> 59:07.125
She's gotta love a guy like you

59:08.545 --> 59:09.711
Quasi?

59:11.214 --> 59:12.381
Quasimodo?

59:12.715 --> 59:14.049
Esmeralda?

59:14.634 --> 59:18.303
Esmeralda, you're all right!
I knew you'd come back!

59:18.972 --> 59:21.473
You've done so much
for me already, my friend.

59:21.558 --> 59:23.559
But I must ask your help one more time.

59:23.643 --> 59:25.143
Yes, anything.

59:28.815 --> 59:32.317
This is Phoebus.
He's wounded and a fugitive like me.

59:32.652 --> 59:36.655
He can't go on much longer.
I knew he'd be safe here.

59:36.739 --> 59:38.407
Please, can you hide him?

59:38.825 --> 59:40.075
This way.

59:48.001 --> 59:49.334
Esmeralda.

59:50.670 --> 59:53.505
You'll hide here
until you're strong enough to move.

59:55.508 --> 59:58.176
Great. I could use a drink.

59:59.679 --> 1:00:01.013
Yes.

1:00:02.098 --> 1:00:06.602
Feels like a 1470 burgundy.
Not a good year.

1:00:06.686 --> 1:00:08.937
That family owes you their lives.

1:00:09.022 --> 1:00:13.609
You're either the single bravest soldier
I've ever seen or the craziest.

1:00:13.693 --> 1:00:15.527
Ex-soldier, remember?

1:00:16.779 --> 1:00:20.616
Why is it, whenever we meet,
I end up bleeding?

1:00:21.784 --> 1:00:23.118
You're lucky.

1:00:23.202 --> 1:00:25.370
That arrow almost pierced your heart.

1:00:26.998 --> 1:00:28.373
I'm not so sure it didn't.

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:49.144
I knew I'd never know
that warm and loving glow

1:00:49.228 --> 1:00:53.899
Though I might wish with all my might

1:00:53.983 --> 1:00:58.737
No face as hideous as my face

1:00:58.821 --> 1:01:04.159
Was ever meant for heaven's light

1:01:26.099 --> 1:01:27.724
Frollo's coming. You must leave.

1:01:27.767 --> 1:01:32.020
Quick, follow me.
Go down the south tower steps.

1:01:32.105 --> 1:01:36.358
Be careful, my friend. Promise
you won't let anything happen to him.

1:01:36.442 --> 1:01:39.111
- I promise.
- Thank you.

1:01:42.448 --> 1:01:44.449
Quick, we gotta stash the stiff.

1:02:01.134 --> 1:02:03.635
Master, I didn't think you'd be coming.

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:07.305
I am never too busy to share
a meal with you, dear boy.

1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:10.183
I brought a little treat.

1:02:22.238 --> 1:02:24.990
Is there something troubling you,
Quasimodo?

1:02:25.658 --> 1:02:27.993
- No!
- But there is.

1:02:29.078 --> 1:02:30.954
I know there is.

1:02:41.591 --> 1:02:44.843
I think you're hiding something.

1:02:44.927 --> 1:02:46.845
No, Master. I... There's no...

1:02:46.888 --> 1:02:48.180
You're not eating, boy.

1:02:49.599 --> 1:02:52.100
It's very good. Thank you.

1:03:00.443 --> 1:03:01.443
Seeds.

1:03:02.862 --> 1:03:05.781
What's different in here?

1:03:05.865 --> 1:03:07.532
Nothing. Sir.

1:03:09.702 --> 1:03:11.828
Isn't this one new?

1:03:11.871 --> 1:03:16.541
It's awfully good.
It looks very much like the gypsy girl.

1:03:16.959 --> 1:03:22.047
I know you helped her escape!

1:03:22.131 --> 1:03:27.219
And now all Paris is burning
because of you!

1:03:27.303 --> 1:03:29.304
She was kind to me, Master.

1:03:29.388 --> 1:03:33.350
You idiot!
That wasn't kindness. It was cunning!

1:03:33.392 --> 1:03:37.729
She's a gypsy!
Gypsies are not capable of real love!

1:03:37.814 --> 1:03:41.149
Think, boy. Think of your mother.

1:03:45.238 --> 1:03:49.157
But what chance could
a poor, misshapen child like you

1:03:49.242 --> 1:03:53.078
have against her heathen treachery?

1:03:53.162 --> 1:03:56.081
Well, never you mind, Quasimodo.

1:03:56.165 --> 1:03:58.583
She'll be out of our lives soon enough.

1:03:58.668 --> 1:04:01.920
I will free you from her evil spell.

1:04:01.963 --> 1:04:04.589
She will torment you no longer.

1:04:04.674 --> 1:04:06.591
What do you mean?

1:04:06.676 --> 1:04:09.427
I know where her hideout is.

1:04:09.512 --> 1:04:12.430
And tomorrow at dawn, I attack

1:04:12.515 --> 1:04:15.058
with 1,000 men.

1:04:26.904 --> 1:04:29.364
We have to find the court
of miracles before daybreak.

1:04:29.448 --> 1:04:32.534
If Frollo gets there first...
Are you coming with me?

1:04:33.536 --> 1:04:36.204
- I can't.
- I thought you were Esmeralda's friend.

1:04:36.289 --> 1:04:38.957
Frollo is my master.
I can't disobey him again.

1:04:39.041 --> 1:04:42.878
She stood up for you. You've got
a funny way of showing gratitude.

1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:50.218
Well, I'm not going to sit by and
watch Frollo massacre innocent people.

1:04:50.303 --> 1:04:52.137
You do what you think is right.

1:04:57.560 --> 1:04:59.895
What? What am I supposed to do?

1:04:59.979 --> 1:05:02.814
Go out there and rescue
the girl from the jaws of death,

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:05.650
and the whole town will cheer
like I'm some kind of a hero?

1:05:05.735 --> 1:05:09.696
She already has her knight
in shining armour, and it's not me.

1:05:12.575 --> 1:05:16.411
Frollo was right.
Frollo was right about everything.

1:05:16.495 --> 1:05:19.706
I'm tired of trying to be
something that I'm not.

1:05:39.936 --> 1:05:41.519
I must be out of my mind.

1:05:43.856 --> 1:05:45.273
Phoebus!

1:05:45.358 --> 1:05:47.776
- I'm coming with you!
- Glad you changed your mind.

1:05:47.860 --> 1:05:50.028
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for her.

1:05:50.112 --> 1:05:51.196
You know where she is?

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:53.865
No, but she said
that this will help us find her.

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:57.285
Good, good, good. Great.

1:05:57.870 --> 1:05:58.954
What is it?

1:05:59.038 --> 1:06:02.374
I'm not sure.
It must be some sort of code.

1:06:02.458 --> 1:06:05.543
Maybe it's Arabic. No, no. It's not
Arabic. Maybe it's ancient Greek.

1:06:05.628 --> 1:06:10.131
"When you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand."

1:06:10.216 --> 1:06:11.383
- What?
- It's the city.

1:06:11.425 --> 1:06:12.801
- What are you talking about?
- It's a map.

1:06:12.885 --> 1:06:15.720
See, here's the cathedral and the river,
and this little stone must be...

1:06:15.763 --> 1:06:19.224
- I've never seen a map that looks like...
- I've lived in the tower for 20 years.

1:06:19.266 --> 1:06:21.685
And I think I know what
the city looks like from above.

1:06:21.727 --> 1:06:23.687
- This is it.
- This is not it.

1:06:25.898 --> 1:06:29.734
All right. Okay.
If you say it's a map, fine. It's a map.

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:33.071
But if we're going to find Esmeralda,
we have to work together.

1:06:33.155 --> 1:06:34.489
Truce?

1:06:34.949 --> 1:06:37.117
Well, okay.

1:06:39.328 --> 1:06:40.495
Sorry.

1:06:41.372 --> 1:06:42.914
No, you're not.

1:06:55.678 --> 1:06:57.429
This looks like the symbol on the map.

1:06:57.471 --> 1:06:58.930
But what does it mean?

1:07:00.683 --> 1:07:02.434
I'm not sure.

1:07:02.518 --> 1:07:03.852
I can make out an inscription,

1:07:03.936 --> 1:07:06.604
but it's going to
take a few minutes to translate it.

1:07:08.774 --> 1:07:11.693
Yes, well.
Or we could just go down those stairs.

1:07:20.453 --> 1:07:22.579
Is this the court of miracles?

1:07:22.621 --> 1:07:26.291
Offhand, I'd say it's
the court of ankle-deep sewage.

1:07:26.375 --> 1:07:28.418
Must be the old catacombs.

1:07:33.215 --> 1:07:34.758
Cheerful place.

1:07:36.552 --> 1:07:39.304
Kinda makes ya wish
ya got out more often, eh, Quasi?

1:07:39.346 --> 1:07:41.347
Not me. I just want to warn Esmeralda

1:07:41.432 --> 1:07:43.975
and get back to the bell tower
before I get in more trouble.

1:07:44.977 --> 1:07:47.645
Speaking of trouble, we should
have run into some by now.

1:07:47.730 --> 1:07:51.316
- What do you mean?
- You know. A guard. A booby trap.

1:07:52.568 --> 1:07:54.027
Or an ambush.

1:07:59.658 --> 1:08:02.577
Well, well, well. What have we here?

1:08:02.661 --> 1:08:03.995
- Trespassers!
- Spies!

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:06.164
- We're not spies.
- You've got to listen...

1:08:06.248 --> 1:08:07.999
Don't interrupt me.

1:08:08.084 --> 1:08:11.044
You're very clever
to have found our hideaway.

1:08:11.128 --> 1:08:15.423
Unfortunately, you won't
live to tell the tale.

1:08:15.508 --> 1:08:17.842
Maybe you've heard of a terrible place

1:08:17.885 --> 1:08:20.345
Where the scoundrels of Paris
collect in a lair

1:08:20.429 --> 1:08:23.932
Maybe you've heard of that mythical
place called the court of miracles

1:08:24.016 --> 1:08:25.016
Hello, you're there.

1:08:25.059 --> 1:08:26.976
Where the lame can walk

1:08:27.019 --> 1:08:29.437
And the blind can see

1:08:29.522 --> 1:08:31.689
But the dead don't talk

1:08:31.774 --> 1:08:34.609
So you won't be around
to reveal what you found

1:08:34.693 --> 1:08:36.861
We have a method
for spies and intruders

1:08:36.904 --> 1:08:39.447
Rather like hornets
protecting their hive

1:08:39.532 --> 1:08:44.119
Here in the court of miracles
where it's a miracle if you get out alive

1:08:46.956 --> 1:08:50.875
Gather around, everybody.
There's "good noose" tonight.

1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:54.796
It's a doubleheader.
A couple of Frollo's spies.

1:08:55.464 --> 1:08:57.048
And not just any spies.

1:08:57.133 --> 1:09:02.595
His captain of the guard
and his loyal, bell-ringing henchman.

1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:05.056
Justice is swift in the court of miracles

1:09:05.182 --> 1:09:07.475
I am the lawyers and judge all in one

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:09.561
We like to get the trial over with quickly

1:09:09.645 --> 1:09:12.063
Because it's the sentence
that's really the fun

1:09:12.148 --> 1:09:14.149
Any last words?

1:09:16.735 --> 1:09:18.736
That's what they all say.

1:09:18.821 --> 1:09:21.698
- Now that we've seen all the evidence
- Wait, I object

1:09:21.740 --> 1:09:22.949
- Overruled.
- I object.

1:09:23.033 --> 1:09:24.909
- Quiet.
- Dang.

1:09:24.994 --> 1:09:28.329
We find you totally innocent

1:09:28.414 --> 1:09:31.499
Which is the worst crime of all

1:09:31.584 --> 1:09:33.168
So you're going to hang

1:09:34.003 --> 1:09:35.128
Stop!

1:09:38.257 --> 1:09:40.592
These men aren't spies.
They're our friends.

1:09:40.634 --> 1:09:43.553
- Why didn't they say so?
- We did say so.

1:09:43.596 --> 1:09:45.763
This is the soldier
who saved the miller's family.

1:09:45.848 --> 1:09:48.183
And Quasimodo helped me
escape the cathedral.

1:09:48.267 --> 1:09:51.019
We came to warn you. Frollo's coming!

1:09:51.103 --> 1:09:52.604
He says he knows where you're hiding,

1:09:52.646 --> 1:09:56.024
and he's attacking at dawn
with 1,000 men.

1:09:56.108 --> 1:09:59.110
Then let's waste no time.
We must leave immediately.

1:10:02.865 --> 1:10:05.116
You took a terrible risk coming here.

1:10:05.201 --> 1:10:07.827
It may not exactly show,
but we're grateful.

1:10:10.873 --> 1:10:13.041
Don't thank me. Thank Quasimodo.

1:10:13.125 --> 1:10:15.710
Without his help,
I would never have found my way here.

1:10:15.794 --> 1:10:17.462
Nor would I.

1:10:27.723 --> 1:10:30.934
After 20 years of searching,

1:10:30.976 --> 1:10:34.896
the court of miracles is mine at last.

1:10:35.898 --> 1:10:37.732
Dear Quasimodo.

1:10:37.816 --> 1:10:40.902
I always knew
you would someday be of use to me.

1:10:40.986 --> 1:10:43.154
- No.
- What are you talking about?

1:10:43.197 --> 1:10:47.283
- Why, he led me right to you, my dear.
- You're a liar.

1:10:47.326 --> 1:10:50.161
And look what else
I've caught in my net.

1:10:50.246 --> 1:10:53.331
Captain Phoebus, back from the dead.

1:10:53.415 --> 1:10:56.501
Another "miracle," no doubt.

1:10:56.585 --> 1:10:58.419
I shall remedy that.

1:11:00.256 --> 1:11:03.549
There'll be a little bonfire
in the square tomorrow.

1:11:03.634 --> 1:11:06.511
And you're all invited to attend.

1:11:06.595 --> 1:11:08.179
Lock them up.

1:11:08.222 --> 1:11:10.348
No, please, Master!

1:11:14.603 --> 1:11:16.271
No, no.

1:11:16.355 --> 1:11:20.525
Take him back to the bell tower.
And make sure he stays there.

1:11:28.701 --> 1:11:33.871
The prisoner, Esmeralda, has been
found guilty of the crime of witchcraft.

1:11:36.292 --> 1:11:37.875
The sentence...

1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:39.002
Death!

1:11:54.184 --> 1:11:58.438
The time has come, gypsy.
You stand upon the brink of the abyss.

1:11:58.731 --> 1:12:01.232
Yet even now it is not too late.

1:12:01.317 --> 1:12:05.862
I can save you from the flames
of this world and the next.

1:12:06.905 --> 1:12:09.574
Choose me. Or the fire.

1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:18.916
The gypsy, Esmeralda,
has refused to recant.

1:12:19.418 --> 1:12:23.755
This evil witch has put the soul
of every citizen in Paris

1:12:23.797 --> 1:12:25.965
in awful jeopardy.

1:12:28.177 --> 1:12:30.053
Come on, Quasi. Snap out of it!

1:12:30.095 --> 1:12:32.764
- Your friends are down there.
- It's all my fault.

1:12:32.848 --> 1:12:34.432
You gotta break these chains.

1:12:34.516 --> 1:12:37.185
I can't. I tried.
What difference would it make?

1:12:37.269 --> 1:12:40.271
- But you can't let Frollo win!
- He already has.

1:12:40.356 --> 1:12:43.024
So you're givin' up? That's it?

1:12:43.108 --> 1:12:45.777
These chains aren't what's
holding you back, Quasimodo.

1:12:45.861 --> 1:12:47.403
Leave me alone.

1:12:50.199 --> 1:12:54.035
Okay. Okay, Quasi.
We'll leave ya alone.

1:12:54.119 --> 1:12:56.621
After all, we're only made out of stone.

1:12:56.705 --> 1:12:59.916
We just thought maybe
you were made of somethin' stronger.

1:13:04.046 --> 1:13:06.756
For justice, for Paris,

1:13:06.799 --> 1:13:09.634
and for her own salvation,

1:13:09.718 --> 1:13:14.764
it is my sacred duty
to send this unholy demon

1:13:14.807 --> 1:13:17.475
back where she belongs.

1:13:19.478 --> 1:13:21.521
No!

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:13.030
Quasimodo!

1:14:25.794 --> 1:14:36.929
Sanctuary!

1:14:37.431 --> 1:14:38.681
- Captain.
- Sir?

1:14:38.724 --> 1:14:40.016
Seize the cathedral.

1:14:42.144 --> 1:14:44.312
Don't worry. You'll be safe here.

1:14:44.396 --> 1:14:45.563
Charge!

1:15:02.331 --> 1:15:04.749
Come back, you cowards!

1:15:05.501 --> 1:15:08.794
You, men, pick up that beam.
Break down the door.

1:15:09.755 --> 1:15:11.088
Alone at last.

1:15:15.260 --> 1:15:17.094
Citizens of Paris!

1:15:17.179 --> 1:15:21.599
Frollo has persecuted our people,
ransacked our city!

1:15:21.683 --> 1:15:26.479
Now he has declared war
on Notre Dame herself!

1:15:27.439 --> 1:15:29.607
Will we allow it?

1:15:39.535 --> 1:15:41.452
I think the cavalry is here.

1:15:41.578 --> 1:15:42.578
Hey, isn't that...

1:15:42.621 --> 1:15:43.704
- Feeble?
- Doofus.

1:15:43.789 --> 1:15:44.997
Phoebus!

1:15:52.965 --> 1:15:54.131
Sorry. Sorry.

1:16:01.306 --> 1:16:02.598
Harder!

1:16:11.275 --> 1:16:13.859
I'm free! I'm free!

1:16:15.737 --> 1:16:16.737
Dang it!

1:16:27.249 --> 1:16:30.459
Ready, aim, fire!

1:16:35.173 --> 1:16:36.757
Are you sure that's how it works?

1:16:38.468 --> 1:16:39.844
Works for me.

1:16:47.686 --> 1:16:48.728
Achilles, sit.

1:16:50.606 --> 1:16:51.814
Get off me!

1:16:51.857 --> 1:16:55.109
Fly, my pretties! Fly, fly!

1:17:01.199 --> 1:17:03.409
Put your backs into it!

1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:38.152
Frollo, have you gone mad?

1:17:38.236 --> 1:17:41.155
I will not tolerate
this assault on the house of God!

1:17:41.239 --> 1:17:43.491
Silence, you old fool!

1:17:43.575 --> 1:17:46.410
The hunchback and I
have unfinished business to attend to.

1:17:46.495 --> 1:17:49.038
And this time you will not interfere.

1:17:51.917 --> 1:17:54.835
We've done it, Esmeralda!
We've beaten them back!

1:17:54.920 --> 1:17:56.379
Come and see.

1:18:00.092 --> 1:18:02.093
Esmeralda, wake up.

1:18:02.260 --> 1:18:03.427
You're safe now.

1:18:05.263 --> 1:18:06.597
Esmeralda?

1:18:08.934 --> 1:18:28.452
No.

1:19:03.155 --> 1:19:04.488
You killed her.

1:19:04.573 --> 1:19:09.535
It was my duty, horrible as it was.
I hope you will forgive me.

1:19:11.663 --> 1:19:15.332
There, there, Quasimodo.
I know it hurts.

1:19:15.417 --> 1:19:19.670
But now the time has come
to end your suffering...

1:19:20.922 --> 1:19:22.047
Forever.

1:19:31.183 --> 1:19:35.186
Now, now, listen to me, Quasimodo.

1:19:35.228 --> 1:19:36.353
No, you listen!

1:19:36.438 --> 1:19:39.690
All my life, you have told me
the world is a dark, cruel place.

1:19:39.775 --> 1:19:44.028
But now I see that the only thing dark
and cruel about it is people like you.

1:19:44.112 --> 1:19:45.529
Quasimodo?

1:19:45.947 --> 1:19:47.531
Esmeralda!

1:19:47.657 --> 1:19:49.200
She lives.

1:19:49.284 --> 1:19:50.326
No!

1:20:12.057 --> 1:20:14.099
Leaving so soon?

1:20:17.312 --> 1:20:19.063
Look, up there!

1:20:19.856 --> 1:20:21.065
Hang on!

1:20:35.914 --> 1:20:39.500
I should have known you'd risk your life
to save that gypsy witch,

1:20:39.584 --> 1:20:43.587
just as your own mother
died trying to save you.

1:20:43.672 --> 1:20:44.672
What?

1:20:44.756 --> 1:20:49.760
Now I'm going to do
what I should have done 20 years ago!

1:21:08.613 --> 1:21:11.282
Hold on.

1:21:19.875 --> 1:21:26.297
And he shall smite the wicked
and plunge them into the fiery pit!

1:21:42.397 --> 1:21:44.815
Quasimodo! Quasi!

1:21:44.858 --> 1:21:47.318
No!

1:23:46.104 --> 1:23:50.482
Three cheers for Quasimodo!

1:23:52.610 --> 1:23:57.156
So here is a riddle to guess if you can

1:23:57.240 --> 1:24:00.784
Sing the bells of Notre Dame

1:24:00.869 --> 1:24:06.331
What makes a monster
and what makes a man

1:24:06.416 --> 1:24:10.169
Sing the bells, bells
Bells, bells

1:24:10.253 --> 1:24:11.712
Whatever their pitch

1:24:11.796 --> 1:24:16.842
You can feel them bewitch you
The rich and the ritual knells

1:24:16.926 --> 1:24:18.510
Of the bells

1:24:18.595 --> 1:24:23.766
Of Notre

1:24:23.808 --> 1:24:30.481
Dame

1:24:39.908 --> 1:24:42.409
Don't you ever migrate?

1:30:36.848 --> 1:30:38.682
Good night, everybody!
