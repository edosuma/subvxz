00:09.070 --> 00:11.039
Once there was the

00:11.040 --> 00:12.373
most beautiful place, EggTown.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.149
A place where rabbits and chickens

00:15.150 --> 00:17.243
lived together in perfect harmony.

00:18.130 --> 00:20.533
Aah, but all was not perfect.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.839
Beyond the lovely meadows in Meroly Brooke

00:23.840 --> 00:26.056
were swamps and badlands,

00:26.057 --> 00:29.153
where creatures lurked
and watched and waited.

00:30.170 --> 00:32.903
And when everyone in EggTown was sleeping,

00:33.920 --> 00:36.604
one little fellow in
particular tried his very best

00:36.605 --> 00:39.599
to watch over his friends,

00:39.600 --> 00:42.653
his name was Good Gracious Grasshopper.

00:49.830 --> 00:51.163
- Good gracious.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.463
Why can't I find a
butterscotch jelly bean.

00:54.464 --> 00:55.297
Gracious.

01:01.450 --> 01:02.559
Who could that be?

01:02.560 --> 01:05.663
Sneaking about in the middle
of the night, good gracious.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.366
Oh, that's Tiny Tessie's house.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.003
Oh no, good gracious.

01:47.891 --> 01:50.391
Aah, wake up Tessie, look out.

02:34.534 --> 02:35.622
Good gracious, good gracious.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.890
I must warn Boss Bunny Baker.

03:17.020 --> 03:19.469
Boss Bunny Baker, Boss Bunny Baker!

03:19.470 --> 03:22.279
Good gracious, good
gracious, wake up please!

03:22.280 --> 03:24.793
Good gracious, get up,
you're being robbed.

03:25.860 --> 03:29.449
- Good Gracious Grasshopper,
what are you doing here?

03:29.450 --> 03:32.539
- Oh, good gracious, Mrs.
Baker, you're being robbed.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.049
There's someone in your shop.

03:34.050 --> 03:35.549
- We're being robbed?

03:35.550 --> 03:38.005
Oh dear, wake up Bossy, quick, quick.

03:41.814 --> 03:45.099
- Oh, he won't wake up, good
gracious, good gracious.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.529
- I know how to wake him.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.833
Bossy, oh Bossy, wake up!

03:54.880 --> 03:56.529
- What? What's that?

03:56.530 --> 03:57.799
- Good gracious, good gracious,

03:57.800 --> 03:59.799
someone's robbing the bake shop.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.200
- I'll call Sergeant O'Hare.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.489
- I don't need Sergeant O'Hare,

04:03.490 --> 04:05.379
no one robs my shop.
- Bossy come back.

04:05.380 --> 04:07.079
Let Sergeant O'Hare handle it.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.259
Oh, please be careful.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.213
Good gracious.

04:11.277 --> 04:12.109
Be careful.
- You're dead.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.669
Who do you think you are?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.820
- Yeah, who do you think you are?

04:15.821 --> 04:16.858
Good gracious.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.708
- Now, you're in for it.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.662
- Yeah, now you're in for it.

04:22.663 --> 04:23.836
Good gracious, good gracious.

04:23.837 --> 04:25.999
You're in trouble now,
sergeant O'Hare is on his way.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.804
This is outrageous, good
gracious, good gracious.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.606
Good gracious!

04:36.723 --> 04:38.840
Oh, no!

04:44.955 --> 04:45.855
Oh, good gracious.

04:47.030 --> 04:50.270
- Now I got you, you
miserable thieving thief

05:18.940 --> 05:20.090
- I'm sorry mama.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.330
- Hey losers, look whose back with dinner.

06:24.331 --> 06:25.331
- All right.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.529
- What took you so long Timothy?

06:29.530 --> 06:32.669
We're starving here and
that Slack Cookie food

06:32.670 --> 06:34.493
tastes like garbage.

06:36.370 --> 06:40.569
- Here Steel, would you
like some chicken wings?

06:40.570 --> 06:42.943
- Oh yeah, thanks Cookie.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.903
- Anyone else care for some wings?

06:52.210 --> 06:54.959
Now let's see how many
presents Timothy brought us

06:54.960 --> 06:57.929
from those sweet little
bunnies and chicks.

06:57.930 --> 07:01.149
Did you bring me any cute chicks?

07:01.150 --> 07:06.150
- Yeah, all the chicks want
you, fried, extra crispy.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.599
- Cough it up Timothy,

07:11.600 --> 07:14.617
lets see what you got from
those EggTown Easter freaks.

07:17.340 --> 07:18.553
You call this a haul?

07:20.145 --> 07:21.801
A little crumby if you ask me.

07:21.802 --> 07:26.052
We give you one simple job
and you'll follow it up.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.719
- I'd have my pockets full

07:36.720 --> 07:41.329
if it wasn't for that
sneaky little grasshopper.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.279
He must've followed me.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.798
- He what?

07:43.799 --> 07:46.519
He followed you back here?

07:46.520 --> 07:49.069
You let yourself be tailed?

07:49.070 --> 07:49.983
You idiot.

07:51.971 --> 07:56.399
- He didn't follow me here,
he followed me into town,

07:56.400 --> 07:58.259
to the bakers but I gave them the slip

07:58.260 --> 08:00.469
when I ducked into the woods.

08:00.470 --> 08:04.149
- He's lying, he's got
fluff cream all over him.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.759
I bet he ate most of the haul.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.229
- Yeah, egg day is almost here.

08:08.230 --> 08:11.069
There had to be more cupcakes and pies.

08:11.070 --> 08:14.139
He's hiding it in the forest for himself.

08:14.140 --> 08:15.103
Let's croak him.

08:16.153 --> 08:17.319
- No, first we make him tell us

08:17.320 --> 08:20.789
where he stashed the
goodies then we croak him.

08:20.790 --> 08:23.949
- I say, if he's keeping our share,

08:23.950 --> 08:25.809
we croak him and eat him.

08:25.810 --> 08:29.699
- I could turn him into a
nice meat pie or a casserole.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.713
- Just try it you vultures.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.689
Shut up, I can't think with
all you dumb cluck shouting.

08:38.690 --> 08:40.840
I swear you don't have
a brain between you.

08:42.020 --> 08:46.333
Okay Steel, get the map, I have an idea.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.319
Those little hair balls are gonna pay.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.765
We're going to make them pay.

08:55.415 --> 08:58.149
Make them pay.

09:09.638 --> 09:14.638
- I can't believe I slept
all night in my chair.

09:15.210 --> 09:18.173
I don't even remember sitting down.

09:22.019 --> 09:27.005
Wake up Tilly, we can't
sleep the day away.

09:27.006 --> 09:32.006
It's Monday morning and
tomorrow is Egg day.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.909
I'm going to go to try to do my shopping.

09:38.910 --> 09:41.059
I won't be gone too long

09:41.060 --> 09:44.503
and I'll bring you back a nice surprise.

09:49.310 --> 09:52.513
Can't go out without my pink chicken lips.

09:55.518 --> 10:00.518
A little feathers spray and
I'm ready to face the day.

10:03.966 --> 10:04.799
Bye Tilly.

10:07.610 --> 10:12.610
What a beautiful day, a
perfectly lovely day to shop.

10:17.712 --> 10:21.095
- Hey guys wait up, wait up you guys.

10:22.897 --> 10:25.669
- Oh, I wish I could run that fast,

10:36.171 --> 10:40.289
Oh, these flowers are beautiful Flora,

10:40.290 --> 10:42.067
almost as pretty as you.

10:43.314 --> 10:45.269
- Ms. Tessie, it's so nice to see you.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.059
I'm glad you like them.

10:47.060 --> 10:50.229
I saved a lovely basket of
violets out back for you.

10:50.230 --> 10:54.283
- Oh Flora, violets are my favorite.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.133
- I know that Ms. Tessie,
I knew you'd love them.

11:00.050 --> 11:04.382
- That's perfect, what do I owe you?

11:04.383 --> 11:06.379
- You don't have to
pay me now, Ms. Tessie.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.315
Would you like me to send you a bill?

11:09.800 --> 11:14.099
- I would love you to
send me a Bill or a Bob

11:14.100 --> 11:18.456
or a Charlie and could you
make sure he's handsome.

11:21.183 --> 11:22.804
Oh my.

11:29.650 --> 11:34.459
Fresh plum cakes, they look luscious.

11:34.460 --> 11:37.373
They were always Timothy's favorites.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.059
- You there with the shawl,

11:45.060 --> 11:47.999
you broke into my shop
last night and robbed me.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.240
I'm calling the police

11:57.100 --> 11:59.724
Would you run and get
sergeant O'Hare for me

11:59.725 --> 12:01.659
and tell him I've captured the thief.

12:01.660 --> 12:03.260
- Tiny Tessie robbed the bakery.

12:04.604 --> 12:06.843
- Boss Baker just said so.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.093
- Look, look at this, here's the evidence.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.439
What's going on here, Boss?

12:14.440 --> 12:17.380
- This is the thief who
robbed me last night.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.079
The dried fluff cream from the pie I threw

12:21.080 --> 12:22.483
is still all over her shawl.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.423
- Ms. Tessie, is this your shawl?

12:31.750 --> 12:34.139
- She admitted it, she nodded yes.

12:34.140 --> 12:36.943
- See, she admits its her
shawl, she nodded yes.

12:38.663 --> 12:41.709
- Ms. Tessie, why won't you speak?

12:41.710 --> 12:44.839
- She's too embarrassed
to speak, she should be.

12:44.840 --> 12:48.629
- Is that why you're nodding
yes and not speaking?

12:48.630 --> 12:52.913
Ms. Tessie, are you ashamed
you robbed the shop last night?

12:54.661 --> 12:57.889
- She admits it, she
confessed to the whole thing.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.769
The fluff bream
is all over her shawl,

12:59.770 --> 13:00.603
that's proof.

13:03.610 --> 13:07.609
- I'm afraid I have no choice
but to arrest you, Ms. Tessie.

13:07.610 --> 13:09.283
You'll have to come with me.

13:12.540 --> 13:15.319
Back up everyone, back to work now.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.053
Let's go folks, move it along.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.539
If you won't come along on
your own accord Ms. Tessie,

13:23.540 --> 13:26.439
we'll just have to carry you off to jail.

13:30.952 --> 13:31.785
- Help me!

13:34.888 --> 13:35.721
Help me!

13:38.246 --> 13:39.079
Help!

13:48.170 --> 13:50.869
- You will notice class
that the only way to weaken

13:50.870 --> 13:52.349
the dangerous wolf vine violet

13:52.350 --> 13:54.879
is to pluck out all the flowers.

13:54.880 --> 13:58.279
That's it, no more
talking, no more laughing,

13:58.280 --> 14:00.579
no more misbehaving, nothing.

14:00.580 --> 14:02.709
Or you'll all be back here tomorrow,

14:02.710 --> 14:04.989
I don't care if it is a holiday.

14:04.990 --> 14:08.139
Who wants to be responsible
for ruining Egg Day?

14:08.140 --> 14:09.693
Go ahead, speak up.

14:12.433 --> 14:14.929
Now, I want it absolutely quiet in here

14:14.930 --> 14:18.063
until the bell rings, no more nonsense.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.789
Good afternoon
teachers and students,

14:20.790 --> 14:24.063
this is your headmaster,
Benedict Bunny speaking.

14:25.780 --> 14:29.250
School will be closed
tomorrow for Egg Day.

14:32.910 --> 14:35.379
- Now, form a single line.

14:35.380 --> 14:38.023
No talking in line, no pushing.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.779
Stop laughing, no humming.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.300
We can stand here all day you know.

14:56.101 --> 14:57.117
I wish.

15:19.492 --> 15:23.489
- That terrible Harriet, I
hope I don't get her next year.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.579
- I had her last year.

15:24.580 --> 15:27.499
- She's so mean, she hates everyone.

15:27.500 --> 15:31.559
- She doesn't hate big
boring Benedict Bunny.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.003
- Be quite she'll hear you.

15:35.180 --> 15:36.012
- Hi.

15:36.013 --> 15:39.133
- High is the opposite of low
young man, good afternoon.

15:43.220 --> 15:45.599
- Tiny Tessie robbed the
bake shop last night.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.579
- She totally destroyed the bake shop.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.789
- The bakers were up all
night cleaning the place.

15:50.790 --> 15:54.179
- I can't believe anyone
could be so stupid.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.659
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

15:56.660 --> 15:57.789
Ms. Tessie could never...

15:57.790 --> 15:59.453
- She's already in jail.

16:00.412 --> 16:01.556
It was a tail plucking.

16:01.557 --> 16:05.229
- Excuse me, but have
you all lost your minds?

16:05.230 --> 16:06.929
Do you really believe Ms. Tessie

16:06.930 --> 16:09.219
robbed Boss Baker shop last night?

16:09.220 --> 16:12.999
- Yes we believe it,
Boss Baker saw her do it.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.089
- He recognized her shawl,

16:15.090 --> 16:17.739
there was fluff cream all over it.

16:17.740 --> 16:18.572
- That proves it.

16:18.573 --> 16:21.389
- That only proves that Boss
Baker isn't any smarter now

16:21.390 --> 16:23.690
than he was when I had
him in the sixth grade.

16:27.212 --> 16:31.169
- Hi, I mean, good afternoon, Ms. Harriet.

16:31.170 --> 16:33.409
- It is not a good afternoon, Mr. Baker.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.009
I understand you have told half
the town and Sergeant O'Hare

16:36.010 --> 16:38.865
that Ms. Tessie robbed
your store last night?

16:38.866 --> 16:39.719
- She did.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.639
- She did not and she
would not, Mr. Baker,

16:43.640 --> 16:46.799
because, well first, she just would not

16:46.800 --> 16:49.109
and second, she could not, Mr. Baker,

16:49.110 --> 16:52.239
because Ms. Tessie does
not venture out at night

16:52.240 --> 16:54.079
because she cannot see well at night

16:54.080 --> 16:57.549
and because she is scared
half to death of Take-Its.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.979
Remember Take-Its Mr. Baker?

16:59.980 --> 17:03.099
Those lazy and thieving old
birds that live in the swamp.

17:03.100 --> 17:06.479
They don't work, they
take whatever they need.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.523
Think about it, Mr. Baker.

17:09.794 --> 17:11.947
- I saw her shawl, she was...

17:12.789 --> 17:13.916
It was her shawl.

17:13.917 --> 17:16.893
- Could her shawl have been
worn by someone else, Mr. Baker?

17:18.460 --> 17:20.309
- We asked her if she robbed the shop

17:20.310 --> 17:23.809
and she shook her head yes like this.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.579
- Mr. Baker, when poor,
Tiny Tessie gets scared

17:26.580 --> 17:28.489
in the least, she forgets how to speak

17:28.490 --> 17:30.479
and her head bobs up and down.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.819
It is called shaking, Mr. Baker,

17:32.820 --> 17:34.999
shaking from being so
frightened of Take-Its

17:35.000 --> 17:37.009
and other idiots who accuse her of crimes

17:37.010 --> 17:38.829
she could not possibly commit.

17:38.830 --> 17:42.379
Do you think Tiny Tessie can
run faster than you, Mr. Baker?

17:42.380 --> 17:44.449
Do you think Tiny Tessie could throw a pie

17:44.450 --> 17:46.819
hard enough to knock you over, Mr. Baker?

17:46.820 --> 17:48.509
Do you think Tiny Tessie could knock over

17:48.510 --> 17:50.146
a great big pastry cabinet, Mr. Baker?

17:50.147 --> 17:52.689
Do you think you should
run over to the jail house

17:52.690 --> 17:54.208
immediately and tell Sergeant O'Hare

17:54.209 --> 17:57.127
you made a mistake, Mr. Baker?

17:57.128 --> 18:00.383
No more nodding Mr. Baker,
just be on your way.

18:11.021 --> 18:13.597
- Get him, get him back.

18:15.675 --> 18:19.712
- No, stay away from my ferret,
she doesn't bother anyone

18:19.713 --> 18:22.160
and stop trampling through my flower beds.

18:29.029 --> 18:31.669
- Hello Miss Harriet, I
just wanted to make sure

18:31.670 --> 18:34.799
you were still planning to
picnic with me tomorrow.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.783
- I always look forward to
our little once a year outing.

18:39.060 --> 18:40.413
- As do I Ms. Harriet.

18:44.824 --> 18:45.656
Big boring Benedict Bunny

18:45.657 --> 18:47.779
is trying to kiss horrible Harriet Hare.

18:47.780 --> 18:49.899
Do you think
he could reach her lips?

18:49.900 --> 18:52.269
- Shall I pick you up at 11 o'clock then?

18:52.270 --> 18:54.259
- 11 o'clock is perfect.

18:54.260 --> 18:57.079
Miss Harriet, I was wondering

18:57.080 --> 19:00.320
if you could come to my...

19:00.321 --> 19:01.834
- I really need to go.

19:08.887 --> 19:10.289
- Are you all right?

19:10.290 --> 19:11.879
Those children were awful.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.009
I've never been so
embarrassed in my entire life.

19:15.010 --> 19:17.679
Headmaster Benedict heard the whole thing.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.959
They were singing that horrible,
horrible Harriet Hare song

19:21.960 --> 19:24.689
the entire time he was speaking to me.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.843
Don't they know I have feelings too?

19:28.570 --> 19:32.720
Well, headmaster Benedict
Bunny is never going to like

19:33.690 --> 19:36.129
or fall in love with anyone who is called

19:36.130 --> 19:38.133
horrible Harriet Hare.

19:39.050 --> 19:41.029
Sometimes I think he only goes out with me

19:41.030 --> 19:42.969
because he feels sorry for me.

19:42.970 --> 19:46.373
I wish he could get to
know me, the real me.

20:09.172 --> 20:13.138
or just what you see

20:15.919 --> 20:19.323
- Hello, oh, hi mother.

20:19.324 --> 20:23.760
No, I will not be bringing
Miss Harriet to dinner tonight.

20:23.761 --> 20:26.969
I did not chicken out
mother, she was busy.

20:26.970 --> 20:28.533
She was very busy.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.809
I know I've said that before.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.469
No one's getting any younger mother,

20:33.470 --> 20:35.633
that would be impossible.

20:37.490 --> 20:40.093
Yes, I will ask her another time.

20:41.620 --> 20:46.039
I agree, I think if she got
to know me she might like me

20:46.040 --> 20:48.659
but I don't think she's sitting home

20:48.660 --> 20:50.773
just waiting for me to ask her to dinner.

20:52.540 --> 20:55.849
Look, I am not perfect at all her mother

20:55.850 --> 20:57.529
and I know there are those who call me

20:57.530 --> 21:01.633
big, boring Benedict Bunny
when they think I can't hear.

21:03.110 --> 21:04.989
No mother, I am not cute.

21:04.990 --> 21:08.713
I am an adult and I am
big and I am boring.

21:10.420 --> 21:13.089
I do not want you to invite her for me.

21:13.090 --> 21:15.573
I will invite her myself
when the time is right.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.503
Maybe on our picnic tomorrow.

21:19.740 --> 21:22.753
Yes I know it's the ninth year in a row.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.713
I love you too, mother.

21:26.736 --> 21:31.736
Well, I can spend another
night practicing my piano.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.838
I just wish Miss Harriet Hare and I

21:33.839 --> 21:36.539
could get to know each other better.

21:36.540 --> 21:39.712
But why would any creature as
lovely as Miss Harriet Hare

21:39.713 --> 21:44.713
fall in love with big
boring Benedict Bunny?

21:45.350 --> 21:48.213
Maybe if Miss Harriet just got to know me.

22:23.717 --> 22:28.717
picnic, I feel so alive

22:59.865 --> 23:04.865
or just what you need

23:25.597 --> 23:30.597
just what you need today

24:15.730 --> 24:18.913
- 11, 12, that's a dozen.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.779
Okay everybody, listen up.

25:00.780 --> 25:02.579
Chocolate tears upstairs,

25:02.580 --> 25:04.879
losers can't be choosers, fourth floor.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.169
We have some changes this year,
Jelly Beans with the greens,

25:08.170 --> 25:10.749
Marshmallows with yellow,
Whites get it right.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.159
Reds use your hands.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.939
If you're working the straw,
stop flapping your jaw.

25:14.940 --> 25:19.400
We want hackers not
slackers, players not layers.

25:23.526 --> 25:25.089
Rappers snap to it.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.633
If you work in this
room you lower the boom.

25:43.850 --> 25:46.608
they're calling me magic

25:46.609 --> 25:48.686
like I know you would

25:53.091 --> 25:57.055
will be good if you can

26:16.993 --> 26:19.387
with candy and money

26:19.388 --> 26:21.853
I gotta have a boss

26:21.854 --> 26:24.223
doughs, I'm the coast

26:33.615 --> 26:36.388
shells in the truck, holdup

26:38.412 --> 26:40.759
your son acting all funny

27:27.980 --> 27:31.719
- Oh, it's no use, I can't
do anything with my ear.

27:31.720 --> 27:35.339
Either one of them, and
on this of all days.

27:35.340 --> 27:36.973
I'm having a bad ear day.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.483
Hmm, too serious, I look
like I'm going to a funeral.

27:54.428 --> 27:56.453
No, this doesn't fit right.

27:59.540 --> 28:02.543
Okay, fluff up my tail,
now what do you think?

28:03.630 --> 28:04.680
Well, do you like it?

28:08.849 --> 28:10.210
Too puffy.

28:10.211 --> 28:12.233
Oh, why didn't you say so?

28:15.350 --> 28:19.269
Thank you very much, I
appreciate your honesty.

28:19.270 --> 28:20.679
Why don't you just say it?

28:20.680 --> 28:21.963
I look horrible.

28:22.900 --> 28:26.469
Well, of course I look
horrible, I'm horrible Harriet.

28:26.470 --> 28:27.763
I don't even wanna go.

28:28.670 --> 28:31.499
Anyone as wonderful and
intelligent is headmaster Benedict

28:31.500 --> 28:35.233
is never gonna fall in love
with horrible Harriet Hare.

28:42.210 --> 28:44.689
Good morning, headmaster Benedict.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.309
- I'm not late, am I?

28:46.310 --> 28:50.129
- Heavens no, you're right
on time, I admire promptness.

28:50.130 --> 28:53.653
I was just reading the
newspaper, let me get my things.

29:00.190 --> 29:03.009
Well, headmaster Benedict,
I thought your proposal

29:03.010 --> 29:05.419
for more napkin holders
on cafeteria tables

29:05.420 --> 29:07.483
was simply inspiring.

29:08.590 --> 29:12.569
- That's very kind of you
Ms. Harriet, thank you.

29:12.570 --> 29:14.869
I didn't think anyone noticed.

29:14.870 --> 29:17.079
Honestly, I can't take all the credit,

29:17.080 --> 29:19.629
it was really my mother's suggestion.

29:19.630 --> 29:21.049
We were having dinner one evening

29:21.050 --> 29:23.566
and I made a bit of a mess.

29:23.567 --> 29:28.203
I had gravy drizzling down
my shirt and globs on the...

29:30.933 --> 29:34.019
Well, I try to institute
new programs now and then

29:34.020 --> 29:35.543
to keep things exciting.

29:44.100 --> 29:45.578
- Oh, I love this song.

29:48.393 --> 29:50.155
- Wow, what a coincidence,
that's my favorite song.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.046
- Oh, you're just saying that.

29:52.047 --> 29:54.589
- No, it's my very favorite song.

29:54.590 --> 29:57.607
I even sing it sometimes
when I'm by myself.

30:01.110 --> 30:02.759
- Okay, if it's your favorite song,

30:02.760 --> 30:04.333
sing me your favorite part.

30:12.549 --> 30:17.549
I won't last without you

30:23.860 --> 30:27.023
So what's your favorite part of the song?

30:28.975 --> 30:33.975
won't last without you

30:38.720 --> 30:39.763
Care to dance?

30:40.693 --> 30:42.643
I might step on your feet.

30:46.977 --> 30:48.759
- I'll take my chances.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.519
- If you don't mind me
saying so, Miss Harriet,

30:50.520 --> 30:52.093
you sure look lovely today.

30:53.070 --> 30:55.076
- Well, thank you, sir.

30:55.077 --> 30:57.343
And that's a nice vest you're wearing.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.563
You do fill it nicely.

31:02.750 --> 31:04.179
- Miss Harriet.

31:04.180 --> 31:06.373
- Please call me Harriet.

31:07.716 --> 31:10.803
- Okay, I will.

31:12.730 --> 31:15.453
Very well, Miss, I mean Harriet.

31:17.130 --> 31:22.130
I've been thinking, that is
thinking of you, I mean of us.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.617
What I mean is...

31:24.947 --> 31:29.470
with me, I can't go on

31:29.471 --> 31:34.471
hang around just waiting

31:37.707 --> 31:39.040
- What was that?

31:42.299 --> 31:44.632
Gross, I can't believe this.

31:47.369 --> 31:48.507
I can't believe this is happening.

31:48.508 --> 31:51.460
- Is the thought kissing
me that disgusting?

31:51.461 --> 31:52.293
No.

31:52.294 --> 31:54.614
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to, I thought you, we...

31:54.615 --> 31:55.447
No.

31:55.448 --> 31:57.409
- I really need to go.

31:57.410 --> 31:59.379
- Miss Harriet, no.

31:59.380 --> 32:02.722
Please, don't go, you don't understand.

32:02.723 --> 32:05.323
- I understand, I really do.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.299
I have a million things to do.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.132
Let me...

32:08.133 --> 32:09.779
- Papers to correct.

32:09.780 --> 32:11.983
- Harriet, no, please.

32:14.590 --> 32:17.023
That's okay birdie, it's not your fault.

32:23.337 --> 32:26.259
No one's ever gonna fall
in love with anyone named

32:26.260 --> 32:28.023
big boring Benedict Bunny.

33:04.410 --> 33:06.903
- Okay, listen up.

33:08.060 --> 33:11.739
I'm tired of small jobs and small rewards,

33:11.740 --> 33:13.343
we're gonna rob hatch house,

33:14.410 --> 33:16.689
and we're gonna clean it up for good.

33:16.690 --> 33:19.639
We'll have enough goodies
to last us a year.

33:19.640 --> 33:23.449
Cookie, you pack the supply,
Steel, tune up that truck,

33:23.450 --> 33:25.269
make sure it doesn't backfire.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.410
We don't want any busy buddies here.

33:29.100 --> 33:31.329
You get all the tools and knives together.

33:31.330 --> 33:36.330
Pinch, find as many buckets,
bags, barrels as you can.

33:36.580 --> 33:38.983
We're not leaving one stinking egg behind.

33:39.970 --> 33:43.199
Now rest of you, empty your pockets,

33:43.200 --> 33:46.501
make sure you have room
to really stuff them.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.932
Then go outside and roll
around in the swamp.

33:48.933 --> 33:49.819
What?

33:49.820 --> 33:51.824
- To camouflage, get it?

33:51.825 --> 33:53.992
Yeah, that's it!

34:30.820 --> 34:35.313
- You moron, you said you
fixed this junk truck.

34:36.172 --> 34:38.729
- Oh, my beak.

34:38.730 --> 34:42.459
I did fix it, it's the way you drive.

34:42.460 --> 34:45.729
Every time I fix it, you
manage to rip off the oil pan

34:45.730 --> 34:47.759
or blow the carburetor.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.529
- All right, shut up the both of you.

34:50.530 --> 34:55.530
Steel, this thing backfires
again and it's your tail.

34:55.883 --> 35:00.303
We wait here till they're
gone then we have some fun.

35:10.897 --> 35:13.279
- Colorers, great job today.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.413
Not too messy I'm happy to say.

35:17.484 --> 35:19.999
Dippers, you worked hard, no one fell in,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.595
not like last year.

35:27.510 --> 35:30.489
Rappers, you can rap for me anytime,

35:30.490 --> 35:33.241
though I'm not your fine shorty.

35:33.242 --> 35:34.074
- Uh huh.

35:38.508 --> 35:40.591
- I have an announcement.

35:41.747 --> 35:43.819
I'd like to read the output for the day,

35:43.820 --> 35:46.087
the grand total is.

35:46.088 --> 35:47.402
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

35:47.403 --> 35:52.260
- And the total is
7,825,403 eggs processed.

35:59.530 --> 36:01.893
That's about 600 more than last year.

36:02.810 --> 36:06.273
Thank you again everyone,
you did a great job.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.163
Be careful going home.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.593
That was one impressive day.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.053
I love this job.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.173
- Hello.

36:50.830 --> 36:52.979
Don't be ridiculous, of course
I wouldn't hang up on you

36:52.980 --> 36:55.619
just because you're Benedict's mother.

36:55.620 --> 36:57.170
Of course I can keep a promise.

36:58.546 --> 37:00.696
I promise I won't tell
Benedict you called.

37:01.608 --> 37:03.163
Why does he feel terrible?

37:04.576 --> 37:06.465
A Bird did what?

37:06.466 --> 37:08.459
Why didn't he tell me?

37:08.460 --> 37:10.085
I thought...

37:10.086 --> 37:11.903
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

37:13.762 --> 37:14.594
Really?

37:14.595 --> 37:16.173
He likes me, Benedict likes me!

37:18.453 --> 37:20.793
Of course, it'll be our little secret.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.699
Absolutely, any time.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.541
I would love to come to dinner

37:26.542 --> 37:29.349
but Benedict will have to invite me.

37:29.350 --> 37:34.350
Oh, thank you for telling me,
it was so wonderful of you.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.030
Good night, Mrs. Bunny.

37:41.390 --> 37:45.163
Big boring Benedict Bunny
likes horrible Harriet Hare.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.309
Oh, what a beautiful
evening, it's perfect!

37:50.310 --> 37:52.683
Nothing could spoil
such a wonderful night.

38:04.850 --> 38:08.187
- Ooh, she is one great looking chick.

38:08.188 --> 38:10.509
Oh, look at
that drumstick, I got...

38:10.510 --> 38:11.760
- You don't remember her?

38:12.620 --> 38:15.579
She's the old bird that
pecked off your tail

38:15.580 --> 38:17.630
first time you tried to catch Hellen Hen.

38:19.020 --> 38:21.359
- Oh yeah, she's a tough one.

38:21.360 --> 38:24.039
- Good, well, she's gone
now so lets get moving.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.963
Okay, let's go.

38:30.820 --> 38:33.339
- Grab, get the gates.

38:33.340 --> 38:35.969
Cookie, don't turn off the truck,

38:35.970 --> 38:37.970
you know it can backfire when it starts.

38:45.896 --> 38:48.313
We're taking everything, now!

39:16.883 --> 39:18.447
What the?

39:18.448 --> 39:19.280
What is it?

39:19.281 --> 39:22.581
- Tiny Tessie detail, Ms.
Tiny Tessie was arrested

39:22.582 --> 39:25.343
for the robbery of Boss Baker's bake shop.

39:26.610 --> 39:29.499
Some old birdie took
their back for you Timothy.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.989
- That's my mother, you oven stuffer.

39:31.990 --> 39:32.990
Your mother!

39:34.330 --> 39:35.809
- Sergeant O'Hare gave a statement earlier

39:35.810 --> 39:39.889
that feather prints found at
the scene were a perfect match

39:39.890 --> 39:43.202
to Ms. Tessie's son,
Terrible Timothy Takeit.

39:43.203 --> 39:47.400
- You got your name in the paper, Timmy.

39:47.401 --> 39:49.063
- According to a reliable source,

39:50.290 --> 39:51.609
Bakers have offered a reward

39:51.610 --> 39:53.999
for the capture of
terrible Timothy Takeit.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.159
I need to write my mother a note.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.723
We can drop it off on the way
back, everyone in the truck!

40:00.920 --> 40:02.208
Come on, chap chap.

40:02.209 --> 40:03.458
Can I have a snack?

40:03.459 --> 40:06.235
No, you can't have a snack.

40:25.210 --> 40:29.241
- I'm worn out, taking
takes a lot out of you.

40:29.242 --> 40:31.842
- You can take that to the bank.

40:37.427 --> 40:39.795
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, gotta go, gotta go.

40:39.796 --> 40:42.839
If I don't go now, I'll
never make it to the swamp

40:42.840 --> 40:44.139
and I'm not going there in the dark

40:44.140 --> 40:45.913
with the rats running around.

41:10.854 --> 41:14.159
- Take-Its, they robbed hatch house!

41:14.160 --> 41:17.333
- I told you not to turn the
engine off you dumb twat!

41:19.428 --> 41:21.379
There's a reward out for me,

41:21.380 --> 41:23.513
you wanna wake up the whole town?

41:38.843 --> 41:42.659
- Good gracious, everybody,
its an emergency.

42:11.357 --> 42:15.940
- Oh my, it's the town bell,
I hope there isn't a fire.

42:26.996 --> 42:28.329
It's from Timmy.

42:30.768 --> 42:32.632
I just found out

42:32.633 --> 42:34.513
what they did to you, I am so sorry.

42:35.474 --> 42:40.474
I'm afraid I hurt you again
tonight, we robbed Hatch House.

42:42.010 --> 42:46.659
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm a terrible chicken,

42:46.660 --> 42:48.729
I'm sorry I am a terrible son.

42:48.730 --> 42:51.169
The others don't know it
yet but I'm leaving soon

42:51.170 --> 42:54.569
to start a new life in
another place far away,

42:54.570 --> 42:55.799
where I can never hurt you again.

42:57.402 --> 42:58.259
I
know you will never forget

42:58.260 --> 42:59.953
how bad I had been.

43:01.290 --> 43:03.740
I hope you will never
forget how much I love you.

43:04.970 --> 43:08.619
Maybe someday things will be different.

43:08.620 --> 43:11.325
I love you Mommy, Timmy.

43:28.830 --> 43:32.150
- Grasshopper, you can
stop ringing that bell.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.503
What's going on?

43:36.024 --> 43:38.363
- It's all gone, it's all gone.

43:39.205 --> 43:40.624
What's all gone?

43:40.625 --> 43:41.457
- Good gracious.

43:41.458 --> 43:42.515
- What's all gone?

43:42.516 --> 43:43.989
- Everything.

43:43.990 --> 43:45.489
- What do you mean everything?

43:45.490 --> 43:47.676
What are you talking about?

43:47.677 --> 43:51.179
- I mean, everything including
Easter has been taken.

43:51.180 --> 43:52.419
Good gracious, good gracious.

43:52.420 --> 43:55.228
Hatch house is empty, I checked it myself.

43:55.229 --> 43:59.872
The Take-Its took every last basket!

44:01.690 --> 44:03.979
- Check it out, deputy Hopper.

44:03.980 --> 44:06.889
Okay folks, everybody remain calm.

44:06.890 --> 44:10.279
I'm sure our pal Good Gracious
here had a one too many

44:10.280 --> 44:12.289
butterscotch jelly beans tonight

44:12.290 --> 44:13.599
and probably had a nightmare.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.129
- I'm completely out of butterscotch

44:15.130 --> 44:18.289
and this is a nightmare
but I not dreaming.

44:18.290 --> 44:20.989
The Take-Its truck
backfired under my porch

44:20.990 --> 44:25.135
and it woke me up, I saw the
eggs myself with my binoculars.

44:27.530 --> 44:29.019
- Hatch house is empty Sergeant,

44:29.020 --> 44:30.279
he's telling the truth, sir.

44:30.280 --> 44:33.376
- Good gracious, of course
I'm telling the truth.

44:33.377 --> 44:35.021
- Take-Its?

44:35.022 --> 44:38.312
Save me, I don't wanna
get chickennapped again.

44:38.313 --> 44:39.993
- Oh, they're not here.

44:40.912 --> 44:42.179
I followed the Take-Its,

44:42.180 --> 44:46.053
they were headed to old
Takeit Town with our eggs.

44:47.020 --> 44:50.133
- They stole my Hokey
pokey records last time.

44:52.122 --> 44:53.205
- Keep quite!

44:54.299 --> 44:57.679
Y'all sound like a bunch of old hens.

44:57.680 --> 44:59.430
We are a bunch of old hens.

45:02.920 --> 45:04.909
- Take-Its believe they
can come to our town

45:04.910 --> 45:07.412
and just take whatever they want.

45:07.413 --> 45:10.223
Well, I say, we're not
gonna take it any longer.

45:11.560 --> 45:14.249
Everyone's Easter was stolen tonight.

45:14.250 --> 45:15.679
We need to go to the swamp,

45:15.680 --> 45:19.183
get our eggs back and kick their tails.

45:23.370 --> 45:25.439
- I have an idea that could work.

45:25.440 --> 45:28.029
If we disguise ourselves like Take-Its,

45:28.030 --> 45:32.289
we can sneak through the swamp
and into old Takeit Town.

45:32.290 --> 45:34.029
While the Take-Its are sleeping,

45:34.030 --> 45:36.419
we'll tie them up and take back our eggs.

45:36.420 --> 45:39.149
Anyway, Ms. Claire-line is right,

45:39.150 --> 45:42.420
I'm going to get the eggs
back, who's going with us?

45:45.450 --> 45:47.069
- I'm going with you Headmaster Benedict

45:47.070 --> 45:48.709
and Ms. Claire-line.

45:48.710 --> 45:51.184
I want the eggs back.

45:53.420 --> 45:56.049
- I'm going too, I'm
small, they won't see me.

45:56.050 --> 45:58.699
Good gracious, I can spy on the Take-Its

45:58.700 --> 46:01.333
and find out what they did with the eggs.

46:03.550 --> 46:06.902
- Last fall I was
chickennapped by Take-Its

46:06.903 --> 46:10.919
and dragged through the
swamp to old Takeit Town.

46:10.920 --> 46:14.059
I know the whole route
to that nasty old place

46:14.060 --> 46:16.245
and I'm ready to lead the way.

46:19.230 --> 46:21.799
- I'll go of course, to protect you all.

46:21.800 --> 46:24.639
- Thank you Sergeant, but
you need to stay in EggTown

46:24.640 --> 46:27.259
to protect our citizens,

46:27.260 --> 46:30.183
just in case the Take-Its
come back and we don't.

46:31.750 --> 46:35.089
- You're right and you are
the boss Headmaster Benedict.

46:35.090 --> 46:37.169
- No, I'm the boss.

46:37.170 --> 46:39.999
Listen, they robbed me, I'm going too.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.272
- Bossy, you're not going without me.

46:43.273 --> 46:45.083
- I don't go anywhere without you,

46:45.970 --> 46:47.783
with your permission, Benedict.

46:49.280 --> 46:52.843
- Of course, Boss and thank
you and you too Bernadette.

46:55.036 --> 46:59.286
To the swamp, to
the swamp, to the swamp,

47:00.181 --> 47:02.771
to the swamp, to the swamp!

47:04.021 --> 47:06.329
Well, the
brave little group went home

47:06.330 --> 47:10.179
to put on the darkest and
shabbiest clothes they could find,

47:10.180 --> 47:13.833
so no one would spot them
traveling to old Takeit Town.

47:31.758 --> 47:33.758
- I hear someone coming.

47:34.620 --> 47:35.570
Whose that?

47:37.610 --> 47:39.260
I don't know who that is.

47:42.194 --> 47:44.157
- I'm going with you.

47:45.116 --> 47:49.263
- Ms. Tessie, you can't come,
you've been through enough.

47:50.290 --> 47:52.839
- That's exactly why I'm going.

47:52.840 --> 47:56.429
My son is the reason you're all here,

47:56.430 --> 48:00.929
someone in my family has
to make things right.

48:00.930 --> 48:05.430
Please, let me come, I
won't be any trouble.

48:06.460 --> 48:09.609
- I think Ms. Tessie has as
much right to come as any of us.

48:09.610 --> 48:11.884
- Okay Tessie, let's go.

48:39.055 --> 48:40.489
- Good gracious, good gracious.

48:40.490 --> 48:44.117
Do you think the Take-Its
are watching us right now?

48:54.713 --> 48:57.989
- That bird looks like he's following us.

48:57.990 --> 49:00.923
- I hope he isn't a spy for the Take-Its.

49:02.750 --> 49:04.913
- I think it's your imagination.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.973
- What is that awful smell?

49:17.949 --> 49:19.449
- It's disgusting.

49:21.160 --> 49:23.283
- Dead bodies, has to be.

49:24.440 --> 49:27.333
- Nope, that's the
stink of polluted water.

49:30.360 --> 49:33.897
- We're going the right way,
we need to cross this stream.

49:37.350 --> 49:39.249
- I can't put my toes in that.

49:39.250 --> 49:41.437
- Would you rather swim across?

50:03.676 --> 50:05.459
- Do you hear that?

50:05.460 --> 50:06.859
- Hear what?

50:06.860 --> 50:07.960
I don't hear anything.

50:09.240 --> 50:12.930
- Exactly, even the crickets
have stopped singing.

50:23.254 --> 50:27.043
- Oh my, what a beautiful flower.

50:28.760 --> 50:31.033
I've never seen a red violet.

50:33.857 --> 50:37.460
Oh, that smell, it's so unusual.

50:40.960 --> 50:45.309
- That's odd, I don't ever
recall seeing red violets before.

50:45.310 --> 50:47.413
Wait a minute, Ms. Tessie.

50:48.670 --> 50:52.149
No, they're wolf vine violets.

50:58.170 --> 50:59.770
- Oh my God, hold on Ms. Tessie.

51:04.015 --> 51:04.847
- It's choking me.

51:04.848 --> 51:06.523
Benedict, use your knife.

51:10.650 --> 51:12.689
- Cut all the flowers, make it bleed.

51:12.690 --> 51:14.240
It's the only way to weaken it.

51:15.711 --> 51:17.294
Help me!

51:19.127 --> 51:21.153
Help me, help me!

51:21.154 --> 51:23.237
- I have her, quick, run.

51:34.547 --> 51:37.639
- I need to get her bandaged,
she's covered in blood.

51:37.640 --> 51:40.669
- She's bleeding but I
can't find the wounds.

51:40.670 --> 51:44.623
- Benedict, that isn't Miss
Tessie's blood, it's yours.

51:45.701 --> 51:46.534
- No!

51:48.747 --> 51:51.414
- Oh Benedict, you are so brave.

51:59.030 --> 52:02.030
- Ms. Tessie, your shawl, it's gone.

52:08.256 --> 52:09.756
- Oh, there it is.

52:13.720 --> 52:15.373
- I'm sorry, Miss Tessie.

52:16.220 --> 52:20.013
- That shawl brought me nothing
but trouble, good riddance.

52:34.410 --> 52:35.763
- Howling is louder.

52:38.660 --> 52:40.453
- Those wolves are closer.

52:41.550 --> 52:43.337
- That bird is still following us.

52:51.260 --> 52:53.119
I hope he's not leading the wolves to us.

52:53.120 --> 52:57.233
- That sign, it was here
before, I remember it.

52:58.380 --> 52:59.859
Good,
that means we're all going

52:59.860 --> 53:02.743
the right way and we're all gonna die.

53:04.390 --> 53:06.207
- I'd like to be home right now.

53:15.730 --> 53:17.983
- Oh, I don't wanna go in.

53:19.960 --> 53:23.593
- We don't have a choice,
I don't know any other way.

53:24.460 --> 53:25.510
- I hate to say this.

53:26.697 --> 53:29.049
- What, what is it?

53:29.050 --> 53:32.050
- I've read about cemetery swamp
pools, how they're haunted.

53:32.930 --> 53:34.369
- Haunted by what?

53:34.370 --> 53:37.159
- There's a legend about
a spirit called Muck.

53:37.160 --> 53:38.529
They say it'll eat you

53:38.530 --> 53:40.869
but first it sucks out your
vital juices through your...

53:40.870 --> 53:42.720
I don't wanna hear the rest?

53:46.537 --> 53:49.579
- Harriet, do you believe
in that weird stuff?

53:49.580 --> 53:51.713
- I didn't say I believe in it.

54:01.731 --> 54:06.731
- Oh, it's no use, we're
stuck in

54:06.890 --> 54:10.900
- Stop screaming, calm down or
we'll never get out of this.

54:12.078 --> 54:16.490
- Oh Harriet, you were
right, why didn't we listen?

54:16.491 --> 54:18.241
Trespassers.

54:19.265 --> 54:20.669
- Quiet, did you hear that?

54:20.670 --> 54:23.170
Trespassers must die.

54:25.043 --> 54:26.710
You must pay a toll.

54:29.610 --> 54:31.499
- How dare you threaten us?

54:31.500 --> 54:33.979
We've done nothing to you, let us go.

54:33.980 --> 54:35.363
- Boss, keep quite.

54:36.550 --> 54:39.802
- I've waited for you, wretched Take-Its.

54:39.803 --> 54:44.334
- Take-Its, we're not Take-Its.

54:46.537 --> 54:47.370
- Explain!

54:53.123 --> 54:55.883
- Please, please, don't hurt us.

54:56.919 --> 54:59.981
We're from EggTown disguised as Take-Its.

54:59.982 --> 55:01.743
The Take-Its stole our Easter eggs.

55:05.010 --> 55:10.010
Sir please, my name is Benedict
Bunny, what may I call you?

55:11.330 --> 55:16.280
- It is of no consequence but
I am the one they call Muck.

55:21.320 --> 55:23.143
You must be their leader,

55:24.150 --> 55:27.463
the one they call Terrible Timothy.

55:28.600 --> 55:32.009
- I told you, I'm Benedict Bunny.

55:32.010 --> 55:36.769
Well, actually they call me,
big boring Benedict Bunny

55:36.770 --> 55:38.926
but I'm not a Takeit.

55:38.927 --> 55:41.150
- Take-Its or not, you are trespassers

55:43.041 --> 55:47.291
and trespassers must die,
did you not see the sign?

55:50.820 --> 55:53.749
- We did but the Take-Its stole our eggs

55:53.750 --> 55:58.639
and we've come risking
everything to get those eggs back

55:58.640 --> 56:02.049
or else no children anywhere

56:02.050 --> 56:04.809
will ever get their Easter baskets.

56:04.810 --> 56:07.483
- I will only eat one of you.

56:08.630 --> 56:13.630
Now, choose the one among you to be eaten.

56:16.800 --> 56:19.063
- We can't choose on
of our own to be eaten.

56:22.209 --> 56:25.183
- Choose or you will all die.

56:26.775 --> 56:29.503
Each of you will whisper to me one name,

56:30.857 --> 56:33.860
the one whose name is spoke the most times

56:36.430 --> 56:37.927
shall be my victim.

56:43.322 --> 56:45.909
- I can't believe this is happening.

56:49.582 --> 56:51.665
I know it's me, isn't it?

56:54.400 --> 56:58.126
I'm so boring, I would be the one everyone

56:58.127 --> 56:59.877
would miss the least.

57:11.787 --> 57:14.839
We had a deal Muck, set them free.

57:14.840 --> 57:17.507
You said only one of us has to die.

57:22.392 --> 57:23.225
- Oh no.

57:30.907 --> 57:32.409
- It's you, Muck?

57:32.410 --> 57:35.023
- Yes, Benedict, my thanks to all of you.

57:36.625 --> 57:40.139
This is how I used to be clean
and free before selfishness,

57:40.140 --> 57:44.333
cruelty and waste conspired to
cast this evil spell upon me.

57:45.420 --> 57:48.639
I asked you for a victim
expecting you to betray each other

57:48.640 --> 57:52.269
but instead you each
unselfishly chose to whisper

57:52.270 --> 57:54.003
your own name to me.

57:55.140 --> 57:56.609
It was the purity in your hearts

57:56.610 --> 57:59.013
that released me from my bondage.

58:00.550 --> 58:02.319
- What happens to you now, Muck?

58:02.320 --> 58:04.869
- Look for me in the fallen rain,

58:04.870 --> 58:06.753
the snowy hill and the morning dew.

58:07.980 --> 58:12.970
Farewell my friends and good
luck on your journey as well.

58:20.430 --> 58:23.729
- If we ever get out of this
place, I'm changing my life.

58:23.730 --> 58:24.709
- What would you change?

58:24.710 --> 58:26.973
- Every day I teach
someone else's children.

58:28.130 --> 58:32.307
Maybe someday, I'd like to teach my own.

58:32.308 --> 58:34.698
- That would be nice.

58:42.288 --> 58:44.757
- This doesn't look familiar.

58:44.758 --> 58:48.259
- Helen, please tell me we're not lost.

58:48.260 --> 58:51.969
- Sorry, I can't remember
if we go left or right.

58:51.970 --> 58:55.559
It was a year ago, my mind was on escaping

58:55.560 --> 58:58.119
not finding my way back here.

58:58.120 --> 59:01.559
- Gracious, oh Benedict,
you need to do something.

59:01.560 --> 59:04.359
- You're right, we have to
split up to confuse the wolves,

59:04.360 --> 59:06.219
they won't know which way to go.

59:06.220 --> 59:07.991
Boss, you take Bernadette,
Harriet, Clair-line

59:07.992 --> 59:10.239
Hellen and Tessie, Good
Gracious, you come with me.

59:10.240 --> 59:11.072
- I'm going with you, Benedict.

59:11.073 --> 59:14.039
- No, you're not Harriet,
it's too dangerous,

59:14.040 --> 59:15.749
I want you to go with Boss.

59:15.750 --> 59:18.999
- Benedict, in case something happens

59:19.000 --> 59:21.549
and we don't make it out of this mess,

59:21.550 --> 59:23.150
I just want you to know how much

59:26.364 --> 59:28.845
I loved seeing you everyday.

59:30.473 --> 59:32.306
- Everybody, run, now!

59:38.589 --> 59:42.649
- They're following us,
the others should be safe.

59:42.650 --> 59:43.483
- I hope so.

59:56.220 --> 59:57.993
- Good gracious, good gracious.

59:59.328 --> 1:00:00.649
It's none of my business,

1:00:00.650 --> 1:00:03.549
but I think Ms. Harriet's
in love with you.

1:00:03.550 --> 1:00:04.383
- I wish.

1:00:09.646 --> 1:00:13.249
Why did you say you think Ms.
Harriet's in love with me?

1:00:13.250 --> 1:00:15.472
- Oh, good gracious, good gracious.

1:00:15.473 --> 1:00:18.029
It's obvious to everyone
but you, Benedict.

1:00:18.030 --> 1:00:20.519
What do you think she was
trying to tell you back there?

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:22.906
I can't believe you didn't at least say,

1:00:22.907 --> 1:00:27.737
"Be careful, Harriet" or "I
love seeing you every day too."

1:00:30.010 --> 1:00:33.729
- I wanted to, I was going
to but I didn't want her

1:00:33.730 --> 1:00:36.099
to get hurt and the wolves distracted me.

1:00:36.100 --> 1:00:39.309
- Well, what distracted you
for the past nine years?

1:00:39.310 --> 1:00:42.659
- Look, Good Gracious, I've
never been able to master

1:00:42.660 --> 1:00:45.143
the nerve to tell her how much I love her.

1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:48.839
I mean, what did you expect?

1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:53.129
They call me big boring Benedict Bunny.

1:00:53.130 --> 1:00:55.243
- I hope you get another chance, Benedict.

1:00:58.530 --> 1:01:00.530
I hope the wolves didn't...

1:01:21.423 --> 1:01:25.844
if you'd ever told me

1:01:25.845 --> 1:01:30.845
night trying to find her

1:01:46.429 --> 1:01:49.530
time I won't fail

1:01:49.531 --> 1:01:52.263
in a prison I've loathed

1:01:54.641 --> 1:01:57.535
ended, my ways I've amended

1:02:14.819 --> 1:02:16.867
find love in my life

1:02:19.997 --> 1:02:22.506
move mountains if I want

1:02:37.312 --> 1:02:39.657
back from the world

1:02:42.499 --> 1:02:44.933
and I'll never forget

1:02:44.934 --> 1:02:47.884
I don't have regrets

1:02:47.885 --> 1:02:50.331
in life is for certain

1:02:56.308 --> 1:03:01.308
feeling like, wow, wow

1:03:40.564 --> 1:03:41.981
Harriet! Harriet!

1:03:43.023 --> 1:03:44.440
Harriet! Harriet!

1:03:46.509 --> 1:03:48.926
- That's Benedict, follow me.

1:03:50.201 --> 1:03:52.409
Benedict, where are you?

1:03:52.410 --> 1:03:54.183
Good Gracious, over here.

1:04:05.340 --> 1:04:07.490
- That's the bird that's
been following us.

1:04:08.470 --> 1:04:10.679
I thought he was spying for the Take-Its,

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:12.249
he's showing us the way.

1:04:12.250 --> 1:04:14.439
Good gracious,
where are you going?

1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:18.463
- Oh, I don't believe it,
it's you from the picnic.

1:04:21.398 --> 1:04:23.667
Thank you my brave friend.

1:04:28.810 --> 1:04:31.239
That must be the opening to the tunnel

1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:32.973
that leads to the Takeit's layer.

1:04:38.174 --> 1:04:40.439
- Good gracious, good
gracious, not so fast.

1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:43.179
This is a job for a grasshopper.

1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:44.599
I'll go in first and make sure

1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:46.399
the Take-Its are still asleep.

1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:49.623
I'm so small they won't notice
me even if they wake up.

1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:51.669
- Only you can make sure

1:04:51.670 --> 1:04:54.399
we don't walk into a nasty situation.

1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:56.283
Absolutely.

1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:03.793
- Good gracious.

1:05:06.630 --> 1:05:09.273
How many cigars can they possibly smoke?

1:05:12.460 --> 1:05:13.837
That was a close call.

1:05:22.315 --> 1:05:24.482
- Well, look what I found.

1:05:26.905 --> 1:05:28.459
Look Cookie, you're always complaining

1:05:28.460 --> 1:05:30.429
you never get any fresh ingredients.

1:05:30.430 --> 1:05:31.728
- Oh, you're twisting it.

1:05:31.729 --> 1:05:33.733
- Well what could be fresher than this?

1:05:37.150 --> 1:05:40.669
- No, toast him with the stolen eggs.

1:05:40.670 --> 1:05:45.123
- No, stuff him in muck
spice and marsh him in gravy.

1:05:46.483 --> 1:05:50.699
- You idiots, we got a
gazillion Easter baskets

1:05:50.700 --> 1:05:53.239
chock full of fresh goodies.

1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:55.190
This one's too scrawny and sour to eat.

1:05:58.190 --> 1:06:02.149
- I know, I know, Grasshopper sandwiches.

1:06:02.150 --> 1:06:06.019
- Enough, you my scrumptious little friend

1:06:06.020 --> 1:06:10.503
are going to be delicious grasshopper pie.

1:06:11.930 --> 1:06:16.373
Now back off, all of you,
I got me some baking to do.

1:06:17.253 --> 1:06:19.109
I like that too.

1:06:19.110 --> 1:06:21.293
- Not much to you, aye Grasshopper?

1:06:23.010 --> 1:06:25.941
- I think we should let him go.

1:06:25.942 --> 1:06:29.923
Poor little guy, he seems like a nice guy.

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.497
- Yeah, I agree, we
really should let him go.

1:06:36.540 --> 1:06:39.999
We are so sorry, my little friend,

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:42.179
we didn't mean to scare you.

1:06:42.180 --> 1:06:43.012
We feel terrible.

1:06:43.013 --> 1:06:48.013
- You look so thin, we've
decided to let you go.

1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:50.659
What kind of host would we be

1:06:50.660 --> 1:06:54.899
if we let you leave
weary and tired and thin?

1:06:54.900 --> 1:06:58.279
How about an egg to fatten
you, I mean, to fill you up?

1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:01.419
Strengthen your legs for
the long journey home.

1:07:01.420 --> 1:07:02.959
- Oh good gracious, good gracious.

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:05.529
Oh, you are all so very kind.

1:07:05.530 --> 1:07:08.369
I love eggs but I really must be going.

1:07:08.370 --> 1:07:10.520
I don't wanna wear out
my welcome, you now.

1:07:12.450 --> 1:07:16.769
- Don't worry about that,
wouldn't you like a little snack?

1:07:16.770 --> 1:07:18.909
- Oh, I'm not hungry.

1:07:18.910 --> 1:07:20.889
- That's too bad.

1:07:20.890 --> 1:07:23.369
- I'm not hungry, I'm starving!

1:07:23.370 --> 1:07:24.409
Oh, good gracious, good gracious.

1:07:24.410 --> 1:07:25.779
My stomach isn't grumbling,

1:07:25.780 --> 1:07:27.989
it's sending out a formal protest.

1:07:27.990 --> 1:07:31.699
You guys take the cake, I
mean that in a good way.

1:07:31.700 --> 1:07:34.639
You didn't even know I was
coming and here you are

1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:36.659
inviting me for breakfast.

1:07:36.660 --> 1:07:41.143
I'd love some egg right
now to strengthen my legs.

1:07:47.510 --> 1:07:49.989
Good gracious, good gracious.

1:07:49.990 --> 1:07:54.806
These eggs are delicious,
thank you so much.

1:07:54.807 --> 1:07:56.079
They're just...

1:08:06.096 --> 1:08:09.013
The pain, everything is going dark.

1:08:13.374 --> 1:08:15.957
I can't, feel a thing, help me.

1:08:19.270 --> 1:08:22.743
Take-Its, I'm dying.

1:08:29.410 --> 1:08:30.747
The eggs are poisoned.

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:33.737
Oh, no, poisoned eggs?

1:08:33.738 --> 1:08:36.390
- It's rat poison and now I'm nothing

1:08:38.205 --> 1:08:41.973
but poisoned grasshopper meat.

1:08:48.143 --> 1:08:48.976
- Oh, no.

1:08:51.860 --> 1:08:56.259
They tricked us, that
could have been one of us.

1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:59.579
They let us steal these poisoned eggs.

1:08:59.580 --> 1:09:02.369
They were trying to croak us.

1:09:02.370 --> 1:09:04.759
- Have they no shame?

1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:06.149
- They're evil.

1:09:06.150 --> 1:09:09.209
- You can't trust anyone today.

1:09:09.210 --> 1:09:13.569
- Wait a minute, not so fast.

1:09:13.570 --> 1:09:15.579
That grasshopper and his friends

1:09:15.580 --> 1:09:18.679
came here to steal those eggs back.

1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:20.719
They put a lot of time and effort

1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:23.676
into decorating and packing and...

1:09:23.677 --> 1:09:25.593
- You know what that means?

1:09:26.550 --> 1:09:29.739
- They don't know the
eggs are poisoned either.

1:09:29.740 --> 1:09:33.469
Rat poison must have accidentally
spilled into the sugar.

1:09:35.530 --> 1:09:37.639
We're outta here, let's hide in the swamp.

1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:40.549
We'll let them steal
back their poisoned eggs.

1:09:40.550 --> 1:09:43.908
After they all croak
like their little friend

1:09:43.909 --> 1:09:46.409
EggTown will be wide open.

1:09:46.410 --> 1:09:49.139
- We'll live at the bake shop.

1:09:49.140 --> 1:09:52.356
- We'll eat anything we
want anytime we want.

1:09:52.357 --> 1:09:53.328
- Yes.

1:09:53.329 --> 1:09:55.395
- I'll never have to cook again.

1:09:55.396 --> 1:09:57.813
All right, way to go.

1:10:02.041 --> 1:10:04.079
Let's go.

1:10:17.259 --> 1:10:19.292
I gotta stop smoking.

1:10:19.293 --> 1:10:20.125
Hurry up.

1:10:20.126 --> 1:10:22.126
Hey, come on.

1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.989
- Good Gracious said he'd
be back in 10 minutes.

1:10:58.990 --> 1:11:00.799
- Something went terribly wrong,

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:02.763
Good Gracious is always punctual.

1:11:03.660 --> 1:11:06.109
- Our little friend would
be here if he could be here.

1:11:06.110 --> 1:11:07.789
They've captured him or worse.

1:11:07.790 --> 1:11:10.649
- He went in first to make
sure it was safe for all of us,

1:11:10.650 --> 1:11:13.395
we owe it to Good Gracious to rescue him.

1:11:13.396 --> 1:11:14.263
- I agree.

1:11:15.130 --> 1:11:16.273
- Let's go.

1:11:21.956 --> 1:11:23.282
- What?

1:11:27.890 --> 1:11:29.989
- That's it then, I'll lead the way.

1:11:29.990 --> 1:11:33.149
Harriet, you follow me, Ms.
Tessie, you get behind Helen.

1:11:33.150 --> 1:11:35.429
Helen, make sure you stay with Ms. Tessie.

1:11:35.430 --> 1:11:37.238
Clair-line, you cover their backs.

1:11:37.239 --> 1:11:38.129
- Good.

1:11:38.130 --> 1:11:40.229
- Boss, you and Bernadette stay in back

1:11:40.230 --> 1:11:42.369
just in case they sneak in behind us.

1:11:42.370 --> 1:11:45.229
Everyone take your
positions, we are going in.

1:11:45.230 --> 1:11:46.523
- Lead the way Benedict.

1:12:06.910 --> 1:12:10.629
- Okay, they could be hiding
so don't wander off too far

1:12:10.630 --> 1:12:12.280
while you look for Good Gracious.

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:34.209
Why would they abandon this place

1:12:34.210 --> 1:12:36.781
and leave the door wide open?

1:12:37.615 --> 1:12:40.753
- Oh no, Good Gracious, no.

1:12:44.432 --> 1:12:46.284
He was so young.

1:12:46.285 --> 1:12:48.297
- He was so brave.

1:12:56.518 --> 1:13:01.453
- Even dead he's the
loveliest shade of green.

1:13:06.542 --> 1:13:08.689
- Good gracious, good gracious, I'm alive.

1:13:08.690 --> 1:13:12.399
I'm just faking it but
those are the nicest things

1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:14.483
anybody has ever said about me.

1:13:16.669 --> 1:13:18.429
What?

1:13:18.430 --> 1:13:21.349
- You're the best
friends anybody ever had,

1:13:21.350 --> 1:13:23.269
you risked your lives for me.

1:13:23.270 --> 1:13:25.289
I'll never forget this moment,

1:13:25.290 --> 1:13:26.989
but we're not out of the woods yet.

1:13:26.990 --> 1:13:28.829
The Take-Its are hiding outside,

1:13:28.830 --> 1:13:31.319
they could return any minute.

1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:32.799
- But we thought you were dead.

1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:35.609
- I played possum, I outsmarted them

1:13:35.610 --> 1:13:37.899
and I don't wanna be
here when they find out.

1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:38.732
- Oh, no.

1:13:38.733 --> 1:13:40.279
- Quick, grab the create
of eggs on the floor,

1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:41.969
I'll explain it on the way home.

1:13:41.970 --> 1:13:44.023
Let's take our eggs and beat it.

1:13:54.265 --> 1:13:56.069
The Take-Its haven't unpacked the baskets

1:13:56.070 --> 1:13:57.033
from the truck yet.

1:13:59.460 --> 1:14:01.089
It's parked behind this tunnel mountain,

1:14:01.090 --> 1:14:02.890
we can drive it back to EggTown.

1:14:14.911 --> 1:14:17.151
Oh, good gracious, that was
close, no one's following us.

1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:21.300
We'll make it if this hunk
of junk doesn't fall apart.

1:14:39.031 --> 1:14:40.028
Did everyone make it?

1:14:40.029 --> 1:14:42.279
Yeah, I think so.

1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:44.849
Where's Timothy.

1:14:44.850 --> 1:14:49.589
He's not here, he
must be outside with the wolves.

1:14:49.590 --> 1:14:51.849
Should we help him?

1:14:51.850 --> 1:14:52.979
- You wanna go out there?

1:14:52.980 --> 1:14:54.303
Forget him.

1:14:56.470 --> 1:15:00.169
- Okay, I'm hungry, make
us something to eat.

1:15:00.170 --> 1:15:03.863
I got a bad feeling we ain't
going anywhere for a while.

1:15:04.830 --> 1:15:08.519
- You idiots, we're out of
food, we didn't stock up

1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:10.700
because we were going
to move into EggTown.

1:15:11.895 --> 1:15:15.379
- They're out of food, what now Dagger?

1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:16.773
- We wait.

1:15:28.318 --> 1:15:29.509
- Are you all right?

1:15:29.510 --> 1:15:32.499
- Definitely, I'm better than all right.

1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:35.349
I have the bravest friends in the world.

1:15:35.350 --> 1:15:37.349
We have our eggs back.

1:15:37.350 --> 1:15:42.024
I'm feeling like wow,
anything is possible.

1:15:42.858 --> 1:15:44.283
- Wow, yay!

1:15:51.430 --> 1:15:53.059
- We're out of forest edge.

1:15:53.060 --> 1:15:55.359
Look, everyone is gathered on the commons,

1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:58.809
they're all waiting for
us, but how could that be?

1:15:58.810 --> 1:16:01.458
- Bossy, beep the horn.

1:16:01.459 --> 1:16:03.963
Yes, yes, by all means beep.

1:16:07.434 --> 1:16:08.823
- Hey, that's my mother.

1:16:09.790 --> 1:16:12.557
Hey mom, over here.

1:16:25.234 --> 1:16:27.459
How did you know were coming?

1:16:27.460 --> 1:16:28.760
- A little birdie told me.

1:16:39.530 --> 1:16:41.869
Tonight, we EggTown are celebrating

1:16:41.870 --> 1:16:46.870
the return of our heroes,
our eggs and our confidence.

1:16:49.660 --> 1:16:53.449
So in appreciation, we
are presenting our heroes

1:16:53.450 --> 1:16:55.319
with fitting tributes.

1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:59.543
First, the unsung hero
award goes to, Hellen Hen.

1:17:11.673 --> 1:17:16.670
The leadership award goes
to, Miss Claire-line Clack.

1:17:26.155 --> 1:17:31.075
The teamwork award goes to,
Boss and Bernadette Baker.

1:17:38.067 --> 1:17:40.849
And I have to award for
performing above and beyond

1:17:40.850 --> 1:17:45.850
the call of duty goes to
well, Miss Tiny Tessie.

1:17:54.750 --> 1:17:57.929
The next award is really
two awards in one,

1:17:57.930 --> 1:18:00.769
for uncommon courage in
the face of certain death

1:18:00.770 --> 1:18:03.559
and for outsmarting the
enemy with strategy,

1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:07.059
the showstopper grasshopper award goes to,

1:18:07.060 --> 1:18:09.303
Good Gracious Grasshopper.

1:18:19.572 --> 1:18:21.999
And now a very special award

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.749
for selfless service in the line of duty,

1:18:24.750 --> 1:18:28.070
the bravery award goes
to, Ms. Harriet Hare.

1:18:36.415 --> 1:18:37.919
- She's our teacher.

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:39.409
- She's so smart.

1:18:39.410 --> 1:18:42.099
- And finally I'm proud to present

1:18:42.100 --> 1:18:46.770
EggTown's action hero award
for boldness, determination

1:18:47.770 --> 1:18:50.779
and for keeping cool in
the face of great peril,

1:18:50.780 --> 1:18:54.149
I am so proud to present this award

1:18:54.150 --> 1:18:58.303
to our music teacher and
headmaster, Benedict Bunny.

1:19:06.532 --> 1:19:10.409
We have refreshments on the
common so enjoy yourselves.

1:19:10.410 --> 1:19:13.639
Let the record show that
from this day forward,

1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:18.375
today shall be known as
Easter Egg Escapade Day.

1:19:22.294 --> 1:19:25.795
- I can't believe we
made it back to EggTown.

1:19:25.796 --> 1:19:30.529
- I know, it's almost as
if it was all a bad dream.

1:19:30.530 --> 1:19:32.453
- Well, it wasn't all bad.

1:19:33.700 --> 1:19:36.405
Thank you for being concerned about me.

1:19:36.406 --> 1:19:40.849
- Oh, you're welcome and thank you for,

1:19:40.850 --> 1:19:43.939
well, thank you for everything.

1:19:43.940 --> 1:19:46.050
I guess now that this escapade is over

1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:48.740
everything can get back to normal.

1:19:50.090 --> 1:19:53.173
- Benedict, everything
can't go back to normal.

1:19:54.420 --> 1:19:55.729
When I was lost in the swamp

1:19:55.730 --> 1:19:58.839
I realized I might never get out alive.

1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:00.990
I thought about all
the things I'm missing.

1:20:02.530 --> 1:20:04.530
I'm not coming back to school, Benedict.

1:20:05.510 --> 1:20:06.869
What?

1:20:06.870 --> 1:20:07.870
- You know what Benedict?

1:20:09.070 --> 1:20:12.133
I was lost, but I've finally found myself.

1:20:13.070 --> 1:20:18.053
I'm not ready to lose that
tomorrow, so, goodbye Benedict.

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.245
Oh, no.

1:20:30.437 --> 1:20:32.519
- What do I do? What do I do?

1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:34.053
Don't leave Harriet.

1:20:36.550 --> 1:20:38.050
- She can't hear you Benedict.

1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:46.480
- Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to bother you.

1:20:46.730 --> 1:20:49.623
There's just one more
announcement I need to make.

1:20:50.814 --> 1:20:55.814
I can't live without you

1:21:00.291 --> 1:21:05.291
I won't last without you

1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:16.799
I won't lose you again.

1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:17.763
- I love you.

1:21:42.235 --> 1:21:43.568
- Good gracious!

1:21:46.911 --> 1:21:50.059
Good gracious, having an
adventure certainly is tiring.

1:21:50.060 --> 1:21:52.369
I think I'll pass up the free refreshments

1:21:52.370 --> 1:21:54.210
and just go straight home.

1:22:07.782 --> 1:22:11.469
Home, home, sweet home.

1:22:11.470 --> 1:22:15.229
I haven't had a jelly bean
in, I don't know how long.

1:22:15.230 --> 1:22:18.133
A butterscotch would
certainly hit the spot.

1:22:18.134 --> 1:22:22.375
the grasshoppers roam

1:22:22.376 --> 1:22:23.379
What's this?

1:22:26.550 --> 1:22:29.489
It's from terrible Timothy Takeit.

1:22:29.490 --> 1:22:33.263
- Hey, little grasshopper,
I saw you breathing.

1:22:36.308 --> 1:22:37.733
- Take good care of my mother.

1:23:05.456 --> 1:23:10.034
take a chance in the sea

1:23:14.358 --> 1:23:19.358
I'll love you too till I die

1:23:44.130 --> 1:23:47.819
- You look strong enough
but it's backbreaking work.

1:23:47.820 --> 1:23:49.909
You have to be willing to work hard.

1:23:49.910 --> 1:23:52.913
- Sir, I wanna work hard.

1:23:53.870 --> 1:23:55.889
Well, Timothy worked hard

1:23:55.890 --> 1:23:58.833
and the farmer never regretted
his decision to hire him.

1:23:59.870 --> 1:24:02.659
What happened to all of our other friends?

1:24:02.660 --> 1:24:06.149
Well, their lives soon returned to normal.

1:24:06.150 --> 1:24:07.559
Oh, and by the way,

1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:10.319
if you should ever be
passing through EggTown,

1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:14.689
look for the tiniest house
on a top of the tallest tree

1:24:14.690 --> 1:24:17.707
and I'm pretty sure you'll
see Good Gracious Grasshopper

1:24:17.708 --> 1:24:20.493
munching jelly beans on his porch.

1:24:21.370 --> 1:24:26.366
And the Take-Its, well
now, that's another story.

1:24:38.430 --> 1:24:42.860
comes along, comes along

1:24:42.861 --> 1:24:47.161
someone sings your song

1:26:56.367 --> 1:27:01.367
loves me when I'm wrong

1:27:02.489 --> 1:27:07.489
said our love will not end
