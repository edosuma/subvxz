Presenting...

00:05.500 --> 00:06.920
Number five:

00:06.920 --> 00:09.010
Star Trek Fan Club Magazine.

00:09.010 --> 00:13.260
Mom, DeForest Kelley's favorite
episode is "The Empath."

00:13.260 --> 00:15.010
Good to know.

00:15.010 --> 00:16.510
ADULT SHELDON:
Number four: the Weather Cube

00:16.510 --> 00:18.010
from RadioShack.

00:18.010 --> 00:20.020
ANNOUNCER (over device):
The humidity is 90%

00:20.020 --> 00:22.190
with a dew point
of 79.5 degrees.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.440
Mom!

00:23.440 --> 00:26.270
The dew point is 79.5 degrees.

00:26.270 --> 00:27.770

Okay.

The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.

Meemaw after a few beers.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.910
It took a while,
but we finally picked a new name

00:41.910 --> 00:44.540
for my bowling team:
The Ball Busters.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.380
Hey, Mom.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.300
Guess what Meemaw named
her bowling team? The Ball...

00:49.300 --> 00:50.630
ADULT SHELDON:
And the number one source

00:50.630 --> 00:52.470
of news from my childhood:

00:52.470 --> 00:54.970
the bulletin board
at the train store.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.470
News about trains
in a store full of trains.

00:59.470 --> 01:01.310
Yummy.

The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour?

01:03.890 --> 01:05.230
(train whistles)

01:06.560 --> 01:08.150
The train museum's
looking for a docent.

01:08.150 --> 01:09.610
What's a docent?

01:09.610 --> 01:10.940
It's a person in a museum

01:10.940 --> 01:12.990
who gives information
on the exhibits.

01:14.070 --> 01:16.570
Do you think they'd let someone
your age do that?

01:16.570 --> 01:18.830
Why not? I have
a high school diploma.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.240
True.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.830
I know more about trains
than anybody.

01:21.830 --> 01:23.000
True.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.580
And I have the unique ability

01:24.580 --> 01:26.500
to wear people down
until I get my way.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.420
So true.

01:33.340 --> 01:37.260
Hello. I understand
you're looking for a docent.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.260
I'm 11 years old,
but you should know

01:39.260 --> 01:40.810
I have a high school diploma

01:40.810 --> 01:43.180
and I know more about trains
than anybody.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.600
You still sound on the fence.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.350
ADULT SHELDON:
It was time to break out
my unique ability.

01:48.350 --> 01:50.860
Let me tell you about
every model train I own

01:50.860 --> 01:52.650
and what each of them
means to me.

01:52.650 --> 01:54.860
The first locomotive
I ever received...

01:54.860 --> 01:56.950
ADULT SHELDON:
Wouldn't you know it,

It's a long drive.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.310
Okay.
I got your lunches here.

02:25.310 --> 02:26.890
Extra Fruit Roll-Ups?

02:26.890 --> 02:28.230
You each got two.
Thank you.

02:28.230 --> 02:29.560
Thank you.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.560
What time is the game?
12:30.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.150
Why are we talking
about baseball

02:33.150 --> 02:35.320
and not my impending
docent-hood?

02:35.320 --> 02:37.070
Who wants to tell him
it's stupid?

02:37.070 --> 02:38.740
Leave it alone.
And why do
they make you wear

02:38.740 --> 02:40.320
that goofy costume?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.580
Ha. They don't. This is all me.

02:43.660 --> 02:44.660
What do you got going on today?

02:44.660 --> 02:45.910
Ooh, laundry,

02:45.910 --> 02:47.910
grocery shopping, vacuuming.

02:47.910 --> 02:50.420
I might go nuts
and dust the picture frames.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.000
Well, nice. Everybody's doing
something they love.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.340
Sheldon, you sure about this?

02:56.340 --> 02:58.930
Yes, leave the crusts on.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.680
I'm a docent now.

03:02.260 --> 03:04.260
Thanks for bringing me.

03:04.260 --> 03:05.680
Hey, it got me out of
driving all the way

03:05.680 --> 03:08.230
to Missy's game;
I should be thanking you.

03:12.690 --> 03:14.610
My little knuckles
might not be cutting it.

03:14.610 --> 03:15.780
Would you give it a go?

03:15.780 --> 03:17.940
Sure.

03:17.940 --> 03:19.030
How's that?

03:19.030 --> 03:20.700
Four knocks. Bold.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.910
(chuckles)

03:21.910 --> 03:23.780
Hello, hello.

03:23.780 --> 03:27.370
Volunteer docent Sheldon
Cooper reporting for duty.

03:27.370 --> 03:29.120
Welcome aboard.

03:29.120 --> 03:32.380
Train nomenclature right
out of the gate. Promising.

03:35.210 --> 03:37.380
I like your conductor's uniform.

03:37.380 --> 03:39.720
You know what they say.
Dress for the job you want.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.470
Do I get an "ask me" button,
too?

03:42.470 --> 03:44.800
Well, thank you for asking,
and yes, you do.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.060
I'll be right back.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.890
Do you see that bell?

03:48.890 --> 03:51.730
That's from Texas and New
Orleans locomotive number 701.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.560
I'd tell you more,
but you haven't contributed

03:53.560 --> 03:54.980
the suggested donation.

04:02.820 --> 04:06.660
Number 701 was built in 1930
by the Baldwin Locomotive Works.

04:06.660 --> 04:10.000
It was a superheated
4-8-4 class GS-1

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
with 7...
I want my money back.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.420
Here you go.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.420
Thank you.

04:15.420 --> 04:16.920
I know you're supposed
to pick me up at 4:00,

04:16.920 --> 04:18.090
but I may live here now.

04:18.090 --> 04:20.090
Send me a Christmas card.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.510
I'm glad Mom didn't come.

04:23.510 --> 04:24.930
Why's that?

04:24.930 --> 04:26.760
I can spit
when I'm on the mound.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.100
You can hock up anything
you want today.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.270
(snorts)

04:30.270 --> 04:32.770
Not here.
Aw.

04:32.770 --> 04:35.020
We need to stop so I can pee.

04:35.020 --> 04:37.270
I told you to pee
before we left the house.

04:37.270 --> 04:39.190
That was an hour and a half ago.

04:39.190 --> 04:41.440
(sighs)
Can't you hold it?

04:41.440 --> 04:43.110
I may spit like a man,

04:43.110 --> 04:44.950
but I have the bladder
of a little girl.

04:46.700 --> 04:47.950
(whirring)

04:49.990 --> 04:51.330
I'm going to work.

04:51.330 --> 04:53.370
Okay, have fun.

04:53.370 --> 04:55.710
What-what time do you think
you'll be back?

04:55.710 --> 04:56.960
Before dinner.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.630
See you then.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.220
(door closes)

05:02.220 --> 05:03.630
(vacuum stops)

05:06.220 --> 05:08.640
And my day off begins.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.140
Just let me know
if you have any questions.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.810
This is a very nice
builder's plate.

05:14.810 --> 05:16.650
How can you be sure
it's not a replica?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.650
Now, that is a great question.

05:18.650 --> 05:21.320
Thank you. I also know
the answer. Do you?

05:21.320 --> 05:25.070
Well, there's, uh,
rust and soot on the back of it

05:25.070 --> 05:28.070
from when it was mounted
to the engine's smokebox.

05:28.070 --> 05:30.490
Very good.

05:30.490 --> 05:32.580
Ah, the 1937

05:32.580 --> 05:34.410
Santa Fe diesel.

05:34.410 --> 05:36.170
I've always loved
that paint scheme.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.170
I wonder if they had
a name for it.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.000
Cat's Whiskers.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.420
Correct.

05:41.420 --> 05:42.760
Ha! Two for two.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.260
Did you know that
the word "train"

05:44.260 --> 05:45.590
comes from
the French verb traîner,

05:45.590 --> 05:47.510
which means to draw or drag?

05:47.510 --> 05:49.850
(chuckles):
Well, I just learned something.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.600
Well, if you enjoy
learning things,

05:51.600 --> 05:54.680
then you and I are on
the fast track to friendship.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.350
Speaking of fast tracks,

05:56.350 --> 05:58.350
the Japanese bullet
train, or Shinkansen...

06:08.530 --> 06:10.580
(exhales)

06:13.450 --> 06:14.950
Ready to roll?

06:14.950 --> 06:17.040
Not really.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.540
What's wrong?

06:20.460 --> 06:22.380
It happened.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.460
What happened?

06:25.460 --> 06:30.300
That thing that happens to girls

06:30.300 --> 06:33.390
when they're becoming
young ladies.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.980
What? Now?

06:36.980 --> 06:39.230
I'm not happy about it, either.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.980
(stammers)
Should we go home?

06:41.980 --> 06:43.570
I'm pitching in an hour.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.320
I-- you think
that's a good idea?

06:45.320 --> 06:46.490
Maybe you need to lie down.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.900
I don't need to lie down.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.490
Okay, well, maybe
I need to lie down.

06:49.490 --> 06:51.120
(sighs)

06:56.910 --> 06:59.250
Okay, we're gonna find a
pay phone and call your mother.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.830
She's not here right now.
What can she do?

07:00.830 --> 07:02.920
Well, I don't know what to do.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.340
We're gonna go to a drugstore
and get what I need.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.340
Go to a drug store.

07:07.340 --> 07:09.420
Okay, I can do that.

07:09.420 --> 07:12.090
Breathe. We're gonna
get through this.

07:12.090 --> 07:14.100
(exhales sharply)

07:15.350 --> 07:16.850
SHELDON:
It's almost
opening time.

07:16.850 --> 07:18.270
Can I flip the sign?

07:18.270 --> 07:19.430
Have at it.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.940
Five, four,

07:25.940 --> 07:29.440
three, two, one.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.610
We're officially open
for business.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.120
Anticlimactic.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.290
(motorcycle revs over TV)

07:47.880 --> 07:50.300
Get him, Dalton. Get him.

07:51.470 --> 07:52.630
GEORGE JR.:
Mary Cooper,

07:52.630 --> 07:54.390
what are you doing?

07:54.390 --> 07:55.640
Nothing.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.140
Why are you watching Road House?

07:57.140 --> 07:59.060
Why aren't you at work?

07:59.060 --> 08:00.480
I asked you first,
and my question

08:00.480 --> 08:01.810
is way more interesting.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.480
It was just on.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.980
I don't even know what that is.

08:05.980 --> 08:08.480
Then how'd you know
his name's Dalton?

08:09.980 --> 08:12.320
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.910
This is a pretty dirty movie.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.080
How do you know? It is rated R.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.240
For violence, language
and sexual content.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.000
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.090
GEORGE SR.:
Nothing to be
embarrassed about.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.260
It's perfectly natural.
Perfectly normal.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.670
Dad, I know.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.260
I'm telling myself.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.390
Uh...

08:35.390 --> 08:37.510
How much money you need?

08:37.510 --> 08:39.510
I'm not going in there. You are.

08:39.510 --> 08:42.020
Why can't you go?
It's embarrassing.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.440
You just said
it wasn't embarrassing.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.940
Well, it is and I lied.

08:45.940 --> 08:47.190
♪ Whoa... ♪

08:47.190 --> 08:49.110

08:57.450 --> 09:00.030
Indeed I do.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.130
which was worn on the Texas
and Pacific Railway.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.790
Then you'll come upon...

09:09.790 --> 09:11.130
Son, I have to take a leak.

09:11.130 --> 09:13.630
It's in the back.
Thank you.

09:13.630 --> 09:16.130
And our toilets flush,
unlike the ones on trains

09:16.130 --> 09:18.220
before 1889.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.640
(train whistle blows)

09:19.640 --> 09:21.310
This is a genuine
locomotive bell

09:21.310 --> 09:24.310
from Texas and New Orleans
number 701.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.730
Now there's a proper technique
to make the purest sound.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.230
Most people don't know
how to do that.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.810

in that brochure are suspect.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.330
(chuckles)
Sheldon, I, uh,

09:46.330 --> 09:48.420
I wrote this brochure.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.500
While the origins of the
Southern Pacific go back

09:50.500 --> 09:54.590
to 1848, the company wasn't
formally started until 1865.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.840
And before you reprint these,
we should talk fonts.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.760
(train whistle blows)

10:00.760 --> 10:02.930
See? It's all in the wrist.

10:02.930 --> 10:05.100
♪ Train kept a-rollin'
all night long... ♪

10:05.100 --> 10:06.680
(train whistle blows)

10:06.680 --> 10:08.690
And early trains used
the drop chute toilet,

10:08.690 --> 10:11.190
also called the hopper toilet,
which was really just a hole...

10:11.190 --> 10:14.190
Couldn't you just listen
to this all day?

10:14.190 --> 10:17.820
♪ And I still wouldn't
let her go. ♪

10:21.950 --> 10:24.450
So how many times
have you seen Road House?

10:24.450 --> 10:27.210
Sorry, can't hear you.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.670
More or less than five?

10:28.670 --> 10:30.290
'Cause that's
how many times I've seen it.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.210
That's how many years
you're gonna be grounded

10:32.210 --> 10:34.130
if you don't drop it right now.

10:34.130 --> 10:35.960
Does Dad know
you like this movie?

10:35.960 --> 10:37.340
(vacuum stops)

10:37.340 --> 10:39.800
No, and it is gonna
stay that way.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.300
Why?
Because it is not

10:42.300 --> 10:44.060
something I should be watching.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.470
Then why are you watching it?

10:47.350 --> 10:50.900
It is a guilty pleasure,
so will you drop it now?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.020
Relax.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.150
I ain't gonna tell nobody.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.860
Thank you.

10:58.860 --> 11:01.070
I think it's awesome
you like it.

11:04.370 --> 11:06.410
It is pretty cool how Dalton

11:06.410 --> 11:08.000
doesn't drive
his Mercedes to the bar

11:08.000 --> 11:09.750
'cause he knows
they're gonna trash it.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.000
Dalton's no dummy.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.670
No, sir.

11:12.670 --> 11:14.500
It's right over there
in aisle two.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.340
Find everything you need today?

11:19.340 --> 11:20.880
Yeah, think so.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.770
(chuckles)

11:29.770 --> 11:31.020
(clears throat)

11:33.770 --> 11:36.270
You don't know
what you're doing, do you?

11:36.270 --> 11:38.110
No, ma'am.

11:38.110 --> 11:39.780
Would you like some help?

11:39.780 --> 11:40.860
Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.860
Okay.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.200
(bell ringing)

11:47.790 --> 11:49.620
Uh...

11:49.620 --> 11:51.040
we need to talk.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.710
About this bell? You got it.

11:52.710 --> 11:55.540
Did you know different
engineers would often...

11:55.540 --> 11:57.460
Son?

11:57.460 --> 11:59.710
You're a sweet kid, but...

11:59.710 --> 12:01.550
I don't think
this is working out.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.470
What? Why?

12:03.470 --> 12:05.550
I-I know everything
there is to know about trains.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.640
Well, you see now,
that there is the problem.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.890
People, when they come here,
they want to enjoy it.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.060
They don't want to get
lectured in the bathroom.

12:13.060 --> 12:15.150
And you have been
correcting me

12:15.150 --> 12:17.230
in front of the visitors
all morning long.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.650
Would you prefer
I send you a memo

12:18.650 --> 12:20.070
of your mistakes
at the end of the day?

12:20.070 --> 12:21.240
No.
Because that's what I did

12:21.240 --> 12:22.610
for the teachers at my school.

12:22.610 --> 12:24.110
I think it brought us
all closer.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.780
Sheldon, it's great
to have knowledge.

12:25.780 --> 12:27.990
But you don't need
to show it off all the time.

12:27.990 --> 12:29.240
Oh, I don't mind.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.120
(chuckles)

12:31.120 --> 12:34.420
You see, trains are
all about balance, right?

12:34.420 --> 12:36.420
Now you put too much water
into a steam engine,

12:36.420 --> 12:38.090
it can't do its job.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.460
You let that water run low--
boom, it'll blow up.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.920
Now, a good engineer

12:42.920 --> 12:45.430
makes sure he uses just
the right amount of water.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.850
Not too little, not too much.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.430
That make sense?

12:51.430 --> 12:53.850
The fireman adjusts the water,
not the engineer.

12:53.850 --> 12:55.850
And then he took
my "ask me" button.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.770
He didn't even ask me.
He just took it.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.530
Everybody gets fired
for something eventually.

13:07.530 --> 13:09.620
For being too good
at their job?

13:09.620 --> 13:11.990
Well, Moon Pie,
sometimes you just get

13:11.990 --> 13:15.540
too excited about
sharing the facts in your head.

13:15.540 --> 13:18.130
But learning facts is
the ant's pants.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.710
Which is
the Australian derivation

13:19.710 --> 13:21.210
of the bee's knees.

13:21.210 --> 13:22.630
See, you just learned something.

13:22.630 --> 13:24.630
And wasn't that
the cat's pajamas?

13:24.630 --> 13:27.880
Alls I'm saying is people
aren't always in the mood.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.510
Well, they should be.

13:29.510 --> 13:31.810
I'm happy to learn
any fact at any time.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.310
Is that so?

13:33.310 --> 13:35.640
Yes.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.310
Grab my knitting bag.

13:37.310 --> 13:38.980
I don't recommend
driving while knitting.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.190
Your reflexes aren't
what they used to be.

13:41.190 --> 13:43.320
Just look in the bag!

13:43.320 --> 13:44.900
Did you know

13:44.900 --> 13:47.400
that there are three
different kinds of yarn?

13:47.400 --> 13:48.990
I didn't.

13:48.990 --> 13:51.700
You got your animal, like wool.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.330
Your plant, like cotton.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.750
And your synthetic,
like acrylic.

13:55.750 --> 13:56.910
Interesting.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.250
You think so?

13:58.250 --> 13:59.830
I'm glad to hear that.

13:59.830 --> 14:02.710
Because each one of them
has plusses and minuses,

14:02.710 --> 14:04.670
and you're about
to hear them all

14:04.670 --> 14:08.010
in mind-numbing detail.

14:12.550 --> 14:13.720
Nothing to worry about.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.930
We got this.
Really?

14:15.930 --> 14:17.350
Everything you need's
right here.

14:18.350 --> 14:20.100
You're the best.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.070
Come on, I'll show you
where the bathroom is.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.780
Oh, and there's a
very helpful cashier

14:24.780 --> 14:26.280
named Gretchen
you need to hug.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.440
Come on.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.530
Here she is, Gretchen.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.450
Another way

14:31.450 --> 14:33.780
to cast on in knitting

14:33.780 --> 14:35.700
is called the slingshot.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.580
Did you know the Wham-O company
was named

14:37.580 --> 14:39.790
after its first product,
the Wham-O Slingshot?

14:39.790 --> 14:42.460
I'm the one saying
the facts right now.

14:42.460 --> 14:44.460
Unless you're tired
of hearing them?

14:44.460 --> 14:46.130
Sick of learning? Never.

14:46.130 --> 14:48.470
Well, that's too bad.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.380
How awesome was it when he
fights those four guys at once?

14:51.380 --> 14:53.220
They were asking for it.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.310
Dalton doesn't fight
unless he has to.

14:55.310 --> 14:57.140
True, 'cause
when the doctor says,

14:57.140 --> 14:58.890
"How many of these fights
you win?" he says...

14:58.890 --> 15:00.730
BOTH:
Nobody ever wins in a fight.

15:00.730 --> 15:03.730
(both laugh)

15:03.730 --> 15:06.570
Mm, and I like how smart he is.

15:06.570 --> 15:08.740
But doesn't feel
like he has to show it off.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.900
No kidding.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.910
Maybe Sheldon should watch it.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.830
Hey, what was Dalton's third
rule of being a good bouncer?

15:14.830 --> 15:16.580
Be nice.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.250
That's right.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.080
I think Dad would love that
you're into stuff like this.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.920
I'm sure he would.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.340
He took me to see Mad Max twice.

15:27.340 --> 15:28.510
Really?

15:28.510 --> 15:30.130
Actually...

15:30.130 --> 15:32.430
the second time,
we couldn't find a sitter,

15:32.430 --> 15:34.090
so we brought you along.

15:34.090 --> 15:35.760
How old was I?

15:35.760 --> 15:37.760
I don't know... four?

15:37.760 --> 15:39.680
No wonder I'm so cool.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.940
So, why you hiding it?

15:43.150 --> 15:46.360
Well, 'cause I'm supposed
to be a good Christian.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.280
Clearly this is something
I need to work on.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.990
Well, before you fix it,
you've got to watch Die Hard 2.

15:52.990 --> 15:56.280
Bruce Willis stabs a guy
in the head with an icicle.

15:58.200 --> 16:02.620
Now, circular knitting produces
a seamless tube.

16:02.620 --> 16:04.460
You already told me that.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.710
Oh, did I?

16:06.710 --> 16:08.960
Can we circle back
to double-pointed needles?

16:08.960 --> 16:10.550
I have a follow-up question.

16:10.550 --> 16:12.630
Hold that thought.

16:14.380 --> 16:17.140
(indistinct chatter)

16:19.890 --> 16:22.140
Strike two!

16:22.140 --> 16:23.890
(crowd cheering)
One more!

16:23.890 --> 16:25.810
Just like that!

16:30.900 --> 16:32.570
Strike three, you're out.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.070
There you go! Ha!

16:34.070 --> 16:35.910
That's how
you do it!

16:35.910 --> 16:37.240
Is that
your little girl?

16:37.240 --> 16:39.330
That's my little lady.

16:44.750 --> 16:46.330
Well, sometimes.

16:53.380 --> 16:57.340
Carrying the stuffing out of the
Caddy was easy. Using it to stop

16:57.340 --> 16:58.930
the guys chasing us...
The kids are asleep.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.510
MacGYVER:
Gasoline would help.

17:00.510 --> 17:02.510
Always does...
You gonna watch that?

17:02.510 --> 17:03.930
Well, it's MacGyver.

17:03.930 --> 17:06.020
He makes stuff out
of other stuff.

17:06.020 --> 17:07.770
MacGYVER:
Sort of a homemade mortar.

17:07.770 --> 17:09.440
Why, did you want
to watch something else?

17:09.440 --> 17:13.030
I thought maybe
we could watch a movie.

17:14.030 --> 17:16.110
Sure, yeah, which one?

17:16.110 --> 17:18.860
Um... I don't know.

17:19.870 --> 17:22.120
I heard that that movie
Road House

17:22.120 --> 17:23.870
is supposed to be good.

17:23.870 --> 17:25.450
What's it about?

17:25.450 --> 17:27.790
I think it's about a guy,

17:27.790 --> 17:30.630
um... Dalton.

17:30.630 --> 17:32.210
Who's a bouncer

17:32.210 --> 17:34.420
who has to clean up a bar

17:34.420 --> 17:37.130
that's been overrun
by a bunch of bad guys.

17:37.130 --> 17:39.640
Oh, yeah, it's got that guy
that looks like Georgie in it.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.220
No, he doesn't.

17:41.220 --> 17:42.720
(laughs):
Are you kidding?

17:42.720 --> 17:44.390
He looks exactly like him.

17:44.390 --> 17:47.560
♪ ♪

17:50.810 --> 17:52.820
