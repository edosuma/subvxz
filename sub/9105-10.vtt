00:07.257 --> 00:08.509

beginnings of a pattern.

00:08.675 --> 00:09.847
<i>And Shirley attacked</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:11.307

to kill her mother.</i>

00:11.470 --> 00:12.312
<i>We don't see that happen.</i>

00:12.471 --> 00:13.472

Would you like me to take
you to the medical center?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.507
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.796
Have you called the police?

04:13.962 --> 04:17.057
Is that why you're here?

04:17.214 --> 04:19.593
No. I wanted
to make sure you were okay.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.478
Not okay. I-I know that.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.229
Well, I'm not okay,
Mrs. Sutter.

<i>So, tech department</i>

05:39.548 --> 05:41.801
have enhanced this GPR scan,

05:41.967 --> 05:45.722

what Pettigrew found.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.515

05:48.682 --> 05:52.607
<i>Animal remains and tusks.</i>

05:52.769 --> 05:55.488

07:30.533 --> 07:32.831
<i>Please have a seat.</i>

07:44.047 --> 07:46.300
I want to talk to you

07:46.466 --> 07:48.719
about something
that affects Liam very much.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.478
Liam?

07:52.681 --> 07:56.481
What I'm about to say is
sensitive, so I need your word

07:56.643 --> 07:59.317
that you won't talk
about this to anyone.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.777
Okay.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.485
It's been suggested
that there are some kind

08:05.652 --> 08:08.155
of environmental toxins
on this island,

08:08.321 --> 08:09.914
and it maybe possible

08:10.073 --> 08:12.371
that Liam has
been affected.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.539
Now we want
to see if there are

08:16.705 --> 08:19.629
any of these toxins
in Liam's brain, and in order

08:19.791 --> 08:22.465
to do that, we need to take

08:22.627 --> 08:25.096
a little fluid from his spine.

08:25.255 --> 08:29.055
No. I'm sorry. I don't think
he's ready for that, not now.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.938
As I understand it, it's not
a complicated procedure.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.474
It's over
in a couple of minutes.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.361
I know how difficult
this must be.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.270
How?

08:41.438 --> 08:44.988
How would you know
that, Governor?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.579
We need to understand

08:49.738 --> 08:53.117
what made Liam attack
Professor Stoddart,

08:53.283 --> 08:55.377
because it may still be
affecting him.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.004
He may not
be getting any better.

08:58.163 --> 09:01.167
If we found
that a chemical

09:01.332 --> 09:03.175
had altered Liam's behavior,

09:03.334 --> 09:05.428
then that would change
everything.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.972
It would mean that what happened

09:12.135 --> 09:14.388
wasn't Liam's fault.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.427
I am here to see Shirley.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.180
The medical center said
she was here.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.591
Why was she moved?

09:51.966 --> 09:54.810
We needed to perform some tests.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.596
This place

09:56.763 --> 09:58.436
is for animals.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.396

not the perpetrator.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.400
These were exceptional
circumstances.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.561
I can tell you now

10:44.727 --> 10:47.230
there was no violence
in Shirley.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.820
None at all.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.610

you are finished?

something like this spread?

23:32.995 --> 23:37.171
Blood, saliva,
a sneeze, a cough.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.926
So, by now,

23:39.084 --> 23:40.927

could be infected.

here but that they can't leave?

24:06.403 --> 24:10.033
800 armed civilians
and four police officers.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.879
All right, we announce
a rabies quarantine.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.585
The normal procedure.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.091
And we test everyone.

24:19.249 --> 24:22.002
You prepare the tests
for everyone in town.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.137
And medical staff
will carry them out,

an environmental toxin
