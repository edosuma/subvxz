03:04.852 --> 03:05.719
Okay.

03:08.756 --> 03:12.960
You want to show us where
the rest of the cameras are?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.832
What do you have to hide?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.441
Test.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.010
You're watching a detective.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.645
Yeah, that's right.

03:53.000 --> 03:53.867
I see you.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.645
Yeah, I mean you.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.546
What?

04:22.330 --> 04:24.031
I need your badge.

04:32.673 --> 04:36.877
Off the record, how long you
been taking police equipment?

04:52.693 --> 04:56.430
I'm sorry, Hood, they asked
me to take your badge.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.998
It wasn't my idea.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.722
That's interesting.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.993
Don't really know what to say.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.828
- You know that we're
here to talk about Tom,

05:27.861 --> 05:30.030
and why he is in jail under
suspicion of two murders,

05:30.063 --> 05:31.632
Merle James and Ray Starling.

05:39.507 --> 05:43.210
- I know when it comes to
murder, everyone is a suspect.

05:43.243 --> 05:47.448
- When did things start
to go off the rails, Hood?

05:48.649 --> 05:51.519
- My life is
perfect, isn't yours?

05:57.090 --> 05:57.958
Tom.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.130
Hi.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.338
What'd you get up to today?

06:55.549 --> 06:57.851
- When you put in master
cameras at your husband's work

06:57.885 --> 06:59.587
and your own home, I mean
you must have some idea

06:59.620 --> 07:02.990
what you were chasing
after in all this.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.102
- At first, it was
just an awful feeling

07:15.135 --> 07:17.004
in the pit of my stomach.

07:17.037 --> 07:20.107
- So why didn't you just
confront Tom about Merle?

07:20.140 --> 07:22.309
- Until then, I'd
never heard of Merle.

07:22.342 --> 07:26.547
At the time, I really didn't
know what I was looking for.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.387
Now I think you all can see

08:07.420 --> 08:10.691
how this will benefit
the entire community.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.593
- You're destroying
everything I care about!

08:12.626 --> 08:13.694
Starling.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.029
Merle, come on, let's go.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.366
Merle, please, come on.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.407
- Starling, will you talk
some sense into your girl?

08:27.440 --> 08:28.942
I'm nobody's girl.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.711
- What was
the most striking thing

08:30.744 --> 08:32.613
you learned about her?

08:34.313 --> 08:36.683
- She was blonde, is that
what you want to know?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.018
You claim.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.321
- She was very
different from me.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.222
How so?

08:44.291 --> 08:48.395
- I guess I admired her
strong moral principles.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.732
- And that's why she
slept with your husband.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.333
Maybe.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.603
Don't feel so bad.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.606
Most marriages are
based in denial.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.418
Was working for Merle's dad

09:45.452 --> 09:48.555
the first time you
started moonlighting?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.290
Guess so.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.529
You have a thing for
the Medieval era?

09:57.998 --> 10:01.234
- Give me back the
Knights of the Round Table

10:01.268 --> 10:03.971
and the search of the San Graal.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.008
Sounds so noble.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.245
What would we women
do without you?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.146
Hmm.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.218
Who are they?

10:21.054 --> 10:24.424
- This is my daughter Merle
and my daughter Hazel.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.695
Have you ever tried
archery, Miss Hood?

10:27.728 --> 10:30.998
- It's not exactly
my weapon of choice.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.701
- Of course Merle's the
crack shot in the family.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.836
You must try it sometime.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.076
- I always worry
when I see my dad

10:43.110 --> 10:45.578
alone with a beautiful woman.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.684
This is my daughter Hazel.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.652
This is Sheila Hood.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.187
Hi.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.356
Be nice to my father now.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.194
- Your father
strikes me as a man

11:01.228 --> 11:04.097
who knows how to
look after himself.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.514
- So, how can I
help you, Miss Hood?

11:25.618 --> 11:28.121
- I'd like to help
you, Mr. James.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.424
- Oh really, well how
are you going to help me?

11:31.458 --> 11:35.662
- I'd like to get to the bottom
of your sabotage problem.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.032
And what's in it for you?

11:39.066 --> 11:41.601
Are you in debt, or something?

11:44.604 --> 11:46.306
Or is this personal?

11:48.708 --> 11:52.412
Of course I deal with
a lot of people but,

11:52.445 --> 11:56.649
I've a hunch this is something
to do with my daughter Merle.

11:59.286 --> 12:02.322
You see Merle is
one of those people

12:03.490 --> 12:07.694
who blames everything in
the world on global warming.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.972
- You're too
beautiful to be a cop.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.307
So, what gives?

12:23.310 --> 12:27.514
By the way, what do you think
of my father, the silver fox?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.852
- I'm not really sure what
to think of your father.

12:31.885 --> 12:36.089
- Hmm, he's a man of grand
appetites and passions.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.260
Merle inherited
his stubbornness.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.495
You're lucky he likes you.

12:43.430 --> 12:47.634
Watch out for Starling, though,
he's a pretty dangerous guy.

12:48.836 --> 12:49.702
How so?

12:51.238 --> 12:52.439
He's not the kind of guy who's

12:52.472 --> 12:56.376
particularly interested
in your nice ass.

12:56.409 --> 13:00.613
He's more interested in taking
advantage of your wounds.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.185
So what do you like about him?

13:06.119 --> 13:08.321
He lets me sing at his bar,

13:08.355 --> 13:12.059
and he likes to touch
women inappropriately.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.634
Aren't you going to
ask me about my sister?

13:23.170 --> 13:24.204
Of course.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.477
If I could say anything,

13:30.510 --> 13:33.046
I admire her sense of purpose.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.886
How she became so different
remains a mystery to me.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.453
How do you mean?

13:41.788 --> 13:44.157
She believes in something.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.062
Compared to Merle,
I'm pretty crass

13:49.096 --> 13:50.630
and materialistic.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.840
Ladies and gentlemen, my sister,

14:01.841 --> 14:02.876
Merle James.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.848
* Lullaby of Birdland,
that's what I *

14:08.882 --> 14:12.852
* Always hear when you say

14:12.886 --> 14:17.090
* Never in my wordland could
there be ways to reveal *

14:18.791 --> 14:21.661
* In a phrase how I feel

14:21.694 --> 14:25.865
* Have you ever heard
two turtle doves *

14:25.899 --> 14:30.103
* Bill and coo when they love

14:30.137 --> 14:34.341
* That's the kind of magic
music we make with our lips *

14:35.842 --> 14:38.445
* When we kiss

14:39.646 --> 14:40.747
No peeking.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.370
Smells like Cubans.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.271
Mm hmm.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.175
That's part of the story.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.266
Louisiana whiskey, no less.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.671
You can open your eyes now.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.914
The ivory-billed woodpecker.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.815
How?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.987
This is a museum piece.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.760
The cigar box is antique.

16:02.395 --> 16:07.234
It's made from the trees
they cut down in Louisiana.

16:07.267 --> 16:11.238
The cigar is from Cuba
where they did the same.

16:14.907 --> 16:15.875
I remember you telling me

16:15.908 --> 16:19.179
that's why the
ivory-bill went extinct.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.985
Don't you like it?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.440
That was

16:47.474 --> 16:49.176
very touching, Hood.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.379
I mean, I thought you'd be
angry enough to kill a guy

16:52.412 --> 16:55.548
and you, you just
give him a present?

16:58.518 --> 17:01.454
- It was like if I could
just create something

17:01.488 --> 17:05.592
that I knew he loved,
maybe I could still

17:05.625 --> 17:08.161
somehow hold onto what we had.

17:53.806 --> 17:57.210
Do you have any evidence
yet that it is sabotage?

17:57.244 --> 17:58.111
None.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.014
Other than damage
from the fires.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.751
But I also have this.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.422
Life is full of
inexplicable things.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.461
Someone sent these to you?

18:23.170 --> 18:27.039
- Now I should tell you
Merle was having an affair

18:27.073 --> 18:30.443
which led to her breaking
off her engagement

18:30.477 --> 18:32.345
with Raymond Starling.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.656
Go ahead, shoot me.

19:52.325 --> 19:55.027
Now point it up just a little.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.397
Good.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.299
Now release the arrow.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.103
Let it go.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.879
Not bad for a first try.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.082
Only with your help.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.551
- I'm just gonna go
make a phone call,

20:18.585 --> 20:22.789
why don't you go get the
arrows, I'll be right back.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.683
Poor thing.

21:24.717 --> 21:28.921
Ah, he looks so peaceful,
but he died so violently.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.528
Mm hmm, mm hmm.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.198
Yeah?

21:39.231 --> 21:40.700
Yeah, it's good.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.068
What?

21:42.101 --> 21:43.403
Let's go.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.303
What?

21:45.972 --> 21:47.607
Nothing, it's...

21:50.343 --> 21:51.310
Your pictures, it's like

21:51.344 --> 21:54.714
you're photographic a
crime scene, you know?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.851
Oh, for real then?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.259
Hey, come here.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.963
This one's still breathing.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.934
- Birds don't
understand windows.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.636
We should put it
out of its misery.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.537
No!

22:19.506 --> 22:23.610
No, we need to take him
to the wildlife center.

22:23.643 --> 22:24.911
- What
was going on with

22:24.944 --> 22:27.346
this whole dead bird thing?

22:27.380 --> 22:30.850
- We were bird
rescue volunteers,

22:30.883 --> 22:32.585
looking for stunned
or injured birds

22:32.619 --> 22:34.487
that had collided
with buildings.

22:34.521 --> 22:38.391
I tagged along, documenting
the deaths because

22:39.358 --> 22:42.094
it was something we
could do together.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.096
Hmm, sounds intimate.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.545
- They say the spirit
of King Arthur is alive

23:32.579 --> 23:35.281
in any old crow that flies back.

23:41.954 --> 23:45.157
- You always get that
worked up over dead birds?

23:45.191 --> 23:48.160
Thought that was
more of a Tom thing.

23:48.194 --> 23:52.699
- I was brought up to believe
in the sanctity of life.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.100
If you say so.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.669
So what was going
on in your marriage

23:56.703 --> 23:59.572
before all this
started to happen?

24:20.693 --> 24:21.994
What's wrong?

24:22.829 --> 24:24.130
Wait.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.698
What's that noise?

28:03.983 --> 28:04.917
Tom?

28:04.951 --> 28:06.052
Yeah.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.019
Baby?

28:07.053 --> 28:08.420
I'm in the kitchen.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.255
Hey.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.489
Hey hey hey hey hey.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.124
You gotta see this.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.293
Check it out.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.029
Oh my God, you're bleeding.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.097
No.

28:18.130 --> 28:18.931
You gotta see this.

28:18.965 --> 28:19.832
You're bleeding.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.100
Wait wait wait.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.434
Look at this, I
got it right here.

28:22.468 --> 28:23.269
Look at me, look at me.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.103
- Wait, wait.
- Look at me!

28:24.136 --> 28:27.073
- Just hang on,
you gotta see this.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.674
Okay.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.342
See this riot cop

28:30.376 --> 28:32.344
hits me with his baton.

28:33.679 --> 28:36.315
- What the fuck are you
doing hitting a cop?

28:36.348 --> 28:38.417
You should have been there.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.787
We were protesting
Futron Energy.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.855
The same assholes
sponsoring your exhibit

28:42.889 --> 28:46.192
produce the oil equivalent of
a quarter of a million tons

28:46.225 --> 28:48.394
of carbon dioxide a day.

28:48.427 --> 28:52.631
Baby, we've been living
with our heads in the sand.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.167
You're blonde.

28:56.602 --> 29:01.107
- At first she seemed to be
strictly interested in Starling.

29:01.140 --> 29:04.676
Maybe the word
stalker is too strong?

29:04.710 --> 29:07.079
But she had a pretty
unhealthy preoccupation

29:07.113 --> 29:08.981
with my sister, Merle.

29:23.996 --> 29:27.433
- I have no idea what
she wanted from me.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.768
But to be honest,

29:31.137 --> 29:34.740
I think she may have
wanted to blackmail me.

29:34.773 --> 29:35.942
They're lying.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.676
We'll get to that later.

29:37.709 --> 29:38.677
When did you first come across

29:38.710 --> 29:40.712
the guy in the cowboy
hat, what's his name?

29:40.746 --> 29:42.514
Bob McIntyre.

29:42.548 --> 29:45.584
- So as part of your
investigation for Mr. James,

29:45.617 --> 29:48.020
he had you follow Tom and Merle

29:48.054 --> 29:50.322
to his fracking
operations, right?

29:50.356 --> 29:51.223
Yeah.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.173
- And the
guy in the cowboy hat,

30:07.206 --> 30:08.607
that, that's Bob McIntyre?

30:08.640 --> 30:09.441
Bob McIntyre.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.276
Right.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.410
What do you think?

30:11.443 --> 30:15.614
Do you think Tom and Merle
were doing the sabotaging?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.381
You know when that was taken?

31:22.414 --> 31:23.282
Sure.

31:24.917 --> 31:25.817
Yeah, not really.

31:25.851 --> 31:27.319
I don't know, obviously
before Merle died.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.487
You know, you just
always seem like

31:28.520 --> 31:30.656
you're enjoying your job.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.159
- Do you know they
say that men and women

31:33.192 --> 31:36.162
think about sex
every seven seconds,

31:36.195 --> 31:39.298
it's just like.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.933
12,000 times a day.

31:41.934 --> 31:44.103
- What is that, your new
favorite pickup line?

31:44.136 --> 31:45.104
No, just,

31:46.205 --> 31:48.307
an interesting statistic.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.689
Everyone has a breaking point.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.592
Me for instance,

32:06.625 --> 32:08.094
I don't think I could
handle watching my wife

32:08.127 --> 32:11.430
do lines off some
naked dude in my bed.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.641
Get the fuck out of here.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.510
- Tom is suspected of
committing two murders,

32:24.543 --> 32:27.046
but if I didn't know you,

32:27.079 --> 32:29.881
I'd say you'd be
a prime suspect.

33:32.911 --> 33:35.047
Did you ever meet her?

33:35.081 --> 33:35.947
No.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.950
I just surveilled her.

33:46.725 --> 33:47.826
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:49.995 --> 33:51.197
Top up?

33:51.230 --> 33:52.264
Hmm, yeah.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.903
What are you looking at?

33:58.937 --> 34:00.739
Is this a new ring?

34:01.673 --> 34:02.708
No.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.010
No, it was my great-aunt's.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.245
I don't usually wear it,

34:06.278 --> 34:08.380
but are you sure you've
never seen it before?

34:08.414 --> 34:11.583
Aren't we supposed
to be married?

34:11.617 --> 34:13.885
- It was familiar, I
just didn't recognize it.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.987
- I guess there's a lot we
don't know about each other.

34:17.022 --> 34:17.822
Sorry, what?

34:17.856 --> 34:18.657
Hmm?

34:18.690 --> 34:19.558
What?

34:21.025 --> 34:23.862
- See, you're not
even listening.

34:23.895 --> 34:28.100
Always busy working late with
your dinosaurs and your birds.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.735
I heard you.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.971
It's your great-aunt's ring.

34:33.004 --> 34:33.871
I like it.

34:34.940 --> 34:35.974
Thank you.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.711
"Forget me not."

35:12.744 --> 35:15.414
- Maybe this is all a
case of cherchez la femme.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.283
Look, you know Tom.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.751
He's a mild-mannered
ornithologist.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.387
- Yeah, but I think
that maybe Tom started

35:21.420 --> 35:24.156
to feel protective over Merle.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.692
Maybe it was a
jealous rage, or a,

35:26.725 --> 35:30.562
a sudden dose of
testosterone just kicking in.

35:30.596 --> 35:31.563
Hey!

35:31.597 --> 35:33.832
- His motive, if you can
categorize it as such,

35:33.865 --> 35:34.900
was self-defense.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.702
- If Tom killed Starling
in self-defense,

35:36.735 --> 35:38.404
why wouldn't you just call
the police right away?

35:38.437 --> 35:39.371
I don't know!

35:39.405 --> 35:40.572
Panic?

35:40.606 --> 35:42.308
Embarrassment?

35:42.341 --> 35:44.443
Maybe we just needed a
little time to process

35:44.476 --> 35:45.711
what had just happened.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.912
We?

35:46.945 --> 35:49.448
You know what I mean.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.817
- This is more like a
case of I will repay you.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.819
- You know that the average
person is caught on camera

35:53.852 --> 35:55.254
over 300 times a day.

35:55.287 --> 35:56.322
It doesn't mean the whole truth

35:56.355 --> 35:58.257
about their lives is exposed.

35:58.290 --> 36:01.092
- Doesn't explain
Tom's behavior.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.432
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

36:06.465 --> 36:07.566
Baby.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.202
- It's like watching the
hour a dog turns into a wolf.

36:10.236 --> 36:11.370
This isn't a black hole, Hood.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.305
If that isn't motivation,
I don't know what is.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.440
This is over.

36:17.576 --> 36:20.078
You know, I'm mystified
as to how you can defend

36:20.111 --> 36:23.582
somebody who betrayed
you so deeply.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.751
If it was me, I'd be
calling my lawyer right now.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.753
- I'm not sure it's
really possible

36:27.786 --> 36:31.022
for you to fully understand
what happened here.

36:31.056 --> 36:34.125
- Remind me again why you
have all this weird creepy

36:34.159 --> 36:35.761
dead stuff in your house.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.564
You'd have to ask Tom.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.732
Tom, babe, why do
we have so much

36:40.766 --> 36:42.934
creepy dead stuff in our house?

36:42.968 --> 36:45.203
It's my job, asshole.

36:45.237 --> 36:48.106
- I don't know, when we
first started dating,

36:48.139 --> 36:51.810
we spent oh half our time
looking at dead things.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.880
Now we have a freezer
full of birds.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.249
Here you go.

36:57.283 --> 37:00.386
Hey guys, give me a
second, I forgot something.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.020
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.692
You guys ready?

37:06.725 --> 37:09.495
The piece de resistance.

37:12.431 --> 37:13.865
What are those?

37:15.033 --> 37:15.901
These

37:18.270 --> 37:20.472
are roasted beetle larvae.

37:21.373 --> 37:22.308
Right?

37:22.341 --> 37:23.742
- Yeah, you know I hear
that beetle protein

37:23.775 --> 37:25.110
is going to save the world.

37:25.143 --> 37:26.011
Yeah.

37:27.045 --> 37:27.913
Sheila?

37:28.747 --> 37:31.049
Come on, you gotta try one.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.522
Aw, you two should have kids.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.259
- No, I would
never bring a child

37:41.293 --> 37:44.663
into the world in
its current state.

37:44.696 --> 37:45.631
Uh, okay.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.401
You've never said that before.

37:49.435 --> 37:52.871
- I've certainly voiced my
reservations, my reluctance.

37:52.904 --> 37:53.939
- Yeah, I know, but
you've never said it

37:53.972 --> 37:55.741
like that before, like
you'd never do it.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.008
- Well, I just
don't to bring kids

37:57.042 --> 37:58.544
for not doing what
I want in life.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.446
Okay, you know what?

38:18.530 --> 38:19.565
Come on.

38:19.598 --> 38:20.732
- No, no, I don't dance.
- Dance with me, come on.

38:20.766 --> 38:21.667
I don't dance.

38:21.700 --> 38:22.568
Oh, God.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.572
- Come on, detective,
on your feet.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.276
See?

38:49.027 --> 38:50.328
Check this out.

39:01.740 --> 39:02.608
- Oh,
what are you doing?

39:02.641 --> 39:03.509
Shh.

39:06.378 --> 39:07.278
Why are you up there?

39:11.282 --> 39:12.884
What are you doing?

39:15.554 --> 39:18.757
- Let's see what
these puppies can do.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.199
You can rewind and pause it.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.269
Sorry you gotta see this.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.138
I was just so,

39:33.171 --> 39:35.974
showing him some new cameras.

39:36.007 --> 39:36.875
See?

39:38.610 --> 39:39.978
Bird's eye view.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.285
Hmm.

40:54.319 --> 40:55.621
Your wife, yes?

40:59.858 --> 41:02.460
You remember me, don't you Tom?

41:03.729 --> 41:04.696
John James.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.468
Yes of course, Mr. James.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.137
How can I help you?

41:16.307 --> 41:20.512
- I hear my daughter has been
speaking with you lately, Tom.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.949
Don't worry, I understand.

41:25.183 --> 41:27.385
I was married once myself.

41:31.289 --> 41:35.493
You know, Futron Energy has a
lot invested in this exhibit.

41:45.003 --> 41:48.540
- I'm just an
ornithologist, doing my job.

41:50.075 --> 41:52.377
Are you sure ornithology

41:52.410 --> 41:55.513
is all you've been
doing lately, Tom?

42:00.852 --> 42:02.854
- Bet some weird things
just started to appear

42:02.888 --> 42:06.424
when you turned on
that camera of yours.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.326
End of times, I guess.

42:11.630 --> 42:15.834
Did Tom ever make mention of
Mr. James coming to visit him?

42:17.268 --> 42:18.136
Yeah.

42:19.470 --> 42:21.840
He was upset, shaken really.

42:22.841 --> 42:25.577
What did he say exactly?

42:25.611 --> 42:28.980
- I remember he went on
about how the oil industry

42:29.014 --> 42:31.449
represented the end
of civilization,

42:31.482 --> 42:35.687
how we should all just leave
fossil fuels in the ground.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.056
And he talked about
pulling the plug

42:38.089 --> 42:40.291
on Mr. James' sponsorship.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.994
- Well, Merle must have
had a lot of faith in Tom.

42:43.028 --> 42:43.995
I mean, do you think Tom had

42:44.029 --> 42:45.731
that kind of power
at the museum?

42:45.764 --> 42:48.133
- Oh, he was
well-regarded there.

42:48.166 --> 42:51.469
And they had to be seen as not
sanitizing dirty oil money.

42:51.502 --> 42:53.905
- I can't help but think it's
something more than that.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.807
What makes you say that?

42:55.841 --> 42:57.308
The body count.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.015
When did you first have a hunch

43:04.049 --> 43:06.685
she was hiding things from you?

43:11.723 --> 43:13.458
I have to ask this.

43:13.491 --> 43:16.027
Were you guys into any
kinky S and M types stuff?

43:16.061 --> 43:17.663
Because there are
pictures that suggest...

43:17.696 --> 43:18.797
No.

43:18.830 --> 43:20.165
- How do you just
keep it to yourself?

43:20.198 --> 43:24.069
I mean, how does a happily
married man like Tom

43:24.102 --> 43:25.971
succumb to a woman like Merle?

43:26.004 --> 43:27.739
I don't know.

43:27.773 --> 43:29.841
Why do birds sing?

43:29.875 --> 43:31.409
I guess they found
a common cause.

43:31.442 --> 43:35.613
- I know, we are the fucking
world, I get it, thanks.

43:35.647 --> 43:36.715
- Do you know everything
that's going on

43:36.748 --> 43:39.685
inside of your
wife's head, Calvin?

43:41.519 --> 43:43.454
- I know that if you put
a piece of raw sirloin

43:43.488 --> 43:47.158
in front of my dog,
he can't resist it.

43:47.192 --> 43:48.159
Fuck you.

43:51.329 --> 43:56.101
- When were you first
made aware of Merle's death?

43:56.134 --> 43:57.568
- We were at home
when the phone rang.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.142
Is everything okay?

44:10.816 --> 44:11.683
What?

44:12.984 --> 44:16.387
He told me an
ex-girlfriend had died.

44:16.421 --> 44:18.123
- I guess by
then Tom was accustomed

44:18.156 --> 44:20.025
to avoiding the truth.

45:15.881 --> 45:17.315
Listen to this.

45:18.249 --> 45:19.785
Look what I found.

45:24.355 --> 45:25.757
This is a definitive recording

45:25.791 --> 45:27.392
of an ivory-billed woodpecker
take at close range

45:27.425 --> 45:29.227
in 1935 in Louisiana.

45:46.444 --> 45:48.379
You should record me.

45:54.519 --> 45:57.956
If I died, wouldn't
you go to my funeral?

46:00.792 --> 46:02.260
You're not her.

46:03.294 --> 46:05.230
I don't care about her.

46:08.433 --> 46:09.801
It's like I said, I
don't want the past

46:09.835 --> 46:11.702
tainting our marriage.

46:12.770 --> 46:13.638
Right.

46:14.940 --> 46:16.574
- Is this really why
you're saying it like that?

46:16.607 --> 46:17.642
No, just I

46:18.643 --> 46:22.347
really don't understand
why you wouldn't go.

46:28.453 --> 46:30.788
It's embarrassing.

46:30.822 --> 46:32.523
It's embarrassing?

46:34.025 --> 46:36.928
What, what's
embarrassing, I am?

46:36.962 --> 46:38.997
Death is embarrassing.

47:15.433 --> 47:16.935
You know what these are?

47:16.968 --> 47:18.536
These are tiny bits
of Merle's body

47:18.569 --> 47:20.738
found at one of
the crime scenes.

47:20.771 --> 47:23.508
In this case, the museum.

47:23.541 --> 47:26.444
- Tom always says our
DNA is like a scrapbook

47:26.477 --> 47:28.846
of our history as a species.

47:30.448 --> 47:34.452
We've got everything from avian
flu and ancient sex viruses,

47:34.485 --> 47:38.689
non-human beings, even bug
shit, right in our blood stream.

47:41.592 --> 47:43.628
Is that what Tom says?

47:45.296 --> 47:49.200
- Four billion years of
death product in our DNA.

47:49.234 --> 47:52.270
Our mortality is mapped out.

47:52.303 --> 47:54.439
We're programmed to die.

47:54.472 --> 47:57.842
- Welcome to the
human race, hon.

47:57.875 --> 47:59.510
- I think sometime soon
we'll be able to change

47:59.544 --> 48:01.612
our physical makeup
and live a lot longer,

48:01.646 --> 48:05.016
you know, like God does in the
Bible with his hands in clay.

48:05.050 --> 48:06.517
- Well, I sure the
fuck hope you're right

48:06.551 --> 48:09.320
and that one day you get
to come back as a sponge

48:09.354 --> 48:11.256
or some blue fucking
algae and live to be

48:11.289 --> 48:13.992
a thousand years
old, but right now,

48:14.025 --> 48:17.362
I'm interested in knowing
if we're to scan Tom's DNA,

48:17.395 --> 48:19.164
will we be able to
tell future generations

48:19.197 --> 48:22.567
that he killed someone
in a fit of rage?

48:41.686 --> 48:44.289
I mean, the jury is still
out on Starling's murder but

48:44.322 --> 48:47.458
Tom is implicated in
Merle's death as well.

48:47.492 --> 48:48.359
God.

48:55.800 --> 48:56.634
Oh fuck.

48:58.636 --> 49:02.507
- I don't get how you
can still cover for him.

49:07.012 --> 49:08.446
Did Tom say anything
when he came home

49:08.479 --> 49:11.082
from dinner that night like

49:11.116 --> 49:13.151
"don't worry your
pretty little head, hon,

49:13.184 --> 49:15.520
"but I stuck my
mistress in a freezer

49:15.553 --> 49:18.223
"with a bunch of
dead fucking birds."

49:27.065 --> 49:27.932
Hey.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.302
For fuck's sake, Hood,
come on, we're cops.

49:31.336 --> 49:33.171
How the fuck do you explain
part of Merle's body

49:33.204 --> 49:36.074
ending up in Tom's
fridge at work?

49:46.951 --> 49:48.486
Can you at least explain to me

49:48.519 --> 49:51.756
these fucking flesh eating bugs?

49:51.789 --> 49:54.559
- They're called
dermestid beetles.

49:54.592 --> 49:55.860
They're useful in cleaning bones

49:55.893 --> 49:58.763
in full skeletons for
scientific preparations.

49:58.796 --> 50:02.033
- Well, that's good for
getting rid of evidence, right?

50:02.067 --> 50:04.235
You went to an archery
range with Hazel.

50:04.269 --> 50:06.104
Not bad for a first try.

50:06.137 --> 50:07.938
- Why do they
call it a bull's eye?

50:07.972 --> 50:09.674
- If you hit a
charging bull in the eye,

50:09.707 --> 50:11.642
the arrow goes right
through the eye socket

50:11.676 --> 50:14.045
and into the brain
without hitting bone.

50:14.079 --> 50:17.348
- You put Merle in
the golden bullseye.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.554
How many points do
you get for that?

50:27.992 --> 50:30.961
- I still think it's obvious
someone had it in for Tom.

50:30.995 --> 50:33.731
- Now you're starting to sound
like a conspiracy theorist.

50:33.764 --> 50:37.034
No, I believe Oswald did it.

50:37.068 --> 50:40.705
- Where were you
the night that Merle died?

50:40.738 --> 50:42.673
- I was at home
watching TV, detective.

50:42.707 --> 50:44.209
- Oh, good, so you
have someone who can

50:44.242 --> 50:46.177
corroborate your alibi.

50:51.716 --> 50:55.253
So, we got this footage
from Starling's camera.

50:55.286 --> 50:57.054
You didn't tell us that
this was the last night

50:57.088 --> 50:59.624
you saw Merle before she died.

51:08.966 --> 51:12.937
- I tracked down images of
Merle's movements that day.

51:12.970 --> 51:14.639
It seemed like just another

51:14.672 --> 51:17.875
fairly ordinary day
in someone's life.

51:25.416 --> 51:29.287
- Arriving at
Flosdale, Flosdale station.

52:19.470 --> 52:23.508
- When did Starling
come into the picture?

52:23.541 --> 52:27.678
- I first really noticed
him at Merle's memorial.

53:26.971 --> 53:31.576
- Aren't you going to
sing Lullaby of Birdland?

53:31.609 --> 53:32.410
You're drunk.

53:32.443 --> 53:34.445
Aw, come on, Hazel.

53:34.479 --> 53:36.614
Sing it for Merle!

53:36.647 --> 53:39.350
Who the hell invited you here?

53:42.520 --> 53:43.554
You're dead.

53:46.123 --> 53:48.225
Roy, get him out of here.

53:49.394 --> 53:50.428
Oh please.

53:51.662 --> 53:52.997
Don't touch me.

53:53.030 --> 53:54.332
Don't touch me!

53:54.365 --> 53:55.232
Stop it.

53:59.203 --> 54:00.237
I see you!

54:04.342 --> 54:06.644
I'll have a whiskey neat.

54:30.668 --> 54:33.904
- You look familiar, have I
seen you somewhere before?

54:33.938 --> 54:34.972
I don't think so.

54:35.005 --> 54:36.907
Keep your voice down.

54:36.941 --> 54:37.808
Why?

54:38.609 --> 54:41.245
You think we're being watched.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.180
- Well, I learned how
to spot a cop in a crowd

54:43.213 --> 54:44.515
when I was very young.

54:44.549 --> 54:45.350
Oh, is that right?

54:45.383 --> 54:46.884
What's the secret?

54:46.917 --> 54:49.854
- The olive stripes
in their pants.

54:56.394 --> 54:58.095
Who's your friend?

54:59.397 --> 55:01.699
- I'm not sure,
we only just met.

55:01.732 --> 55:03.100
Sheila Hood.

55:03.133 --> 55:06.036
My husband knew
your sister Merle.

55:06.070 --> 55:06.937
How did you know Merle?

55:06.971 --> 55:07.905
- Well, I didn't
really know Merle,

55:07.938 --> 55:10.375
but like I said my husband did.

55:10.408 --> 55:11.542
And who's your husband?

55:11.576 --> 55:12.843
Tom Kale.

55:12.877 --> 55:15.179
He used to go out with her.

55:19.784 --> 55:23.921
- Don't worry, he doesn't
know our little secret.

55:31.261 --> 55:32.430
You've have to excuse her.

55:32.463 --> 55:36.166
She's not deal with
Merle's death very well.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.472
So tell me, um,

55:44.642 --> 55:46.310
what would an attractive
woman like you

55:46.343 --> 55:50.214
be doing with a guy with
a name like Tom Kale?

55:51.782 --> 55:53.551
- You know what, I
think I gotta go.

55:53.584 --> 55:55.052
No.

55:55.085 --> 55:55.953
You stay.

55:57.254 --> 55:58.556
Another time.

56:02.259 --> 56:03.594
- As a cop,
why do you get involved

56:03.628 --> 56:06.263
with a known criminal
like Starling?

56:06.296 --> 56:09.900
- I thought he would
lead me to a solution.

56:18.909 --> 56:23.113
Starling did have an unhealthy
preoccupation with Tom.

56:31.956 --> 56:35.292
- Make sure you wear that
kimono when you see Tom.

56:35.325 --> 56:37.728
- Starling hired you,
right, to do what?

56:37.762 --> 56:38.996
Investigate Merle's death.

56:39.029 --> 56:40.130
- Okay, but don't
you find that crazy,

56:40.164 --> 56:42.199
because what Mr. James
had already hired you.

56:42.232 --> 56:43.601
Did Starling know that?

56:43.634 --> 56:46.136
- Starling never really
mentioned Mr. James.

56:46.170 --> 56:47.037
I think

56:48.072 --> 56:49.540
I was trying to see
where all this was going.

56:49.574 --> 56:51.709
I think he just wanted to
use me to fuck with Tom.

56:51.742 --> 56:52.610
How so?

56:55.012 --> 56:56.814
- Maybe he thought that Tom
and Merle shared something

56:56.847 --> 56:58.115
that he and she never did.

56:58.148 --> 57:01.852
Maybe he felt like he
lost control over her.

57:13.063 --> 57:17.267
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't
drop in on you like this.

57:19.904 --> 57:24.108
You were one of the few
people Merle ever trusted.

57:27.244 --> 57:30.280
- Merle never really
trusted anyone.

57:35.853 --> 57:39.289
- So this is what all
the fuss was about.

57:43.093 --> 57:43.961
Yeah.

57:46.564 --> 57:48.999
I'm trying to show that

57:49.033 --> 57:51.435
birds didn't descent directly
from the theropod dinosaurs

57:51.468 --> 57:55.439
but likely the small,
reptilian thecodonts

57:55.472 --> 57:59.176
that roamed the earth
250 million years ago.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.515
Wow, is that like the,

58:06.016 --> 58:06.884
arc,

58:10.354 --> 58:11.388
archaeopteryx?

58:11.421 --> 58:12.790
Archaeopteryx.

58:15.726 --> 58:20.531
- That's all I can remember
from my natural science class.

58:20.565 --> 58:22.032
That's not bad.

58:32.409 --> 58:36.246
- I think my sister's
intentions were good.

58:36.280 --> 58:38.716
My dad as much as he loved Merle

58:38.749 --> 58:41.952
thought she had lost
her way and perhaps

58:41.986 --> 58:44.254
was a bad influence on you.

58:48.058 --> 58:50.761
He really likes you, by the way.

58:54.498 --> 58:58.102
He thinks you're doing
important work here.

59:30.567 --> 59:31.435
Hmm.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.143
Are you an actress?

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:17.614
- Well, that's a
tawdry pickup line.

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:19.616
- I only meant there's
something superficial

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.786
and insincere about you.

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:22.853
Oh.

01:00:22.887 --> 01:00:25.890
You're not who you seem to be.

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:27.124
- Well, you already
know I'm a cop

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:31.361
but sometimes I like to
moonlight as a private eye.

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:37.802
- You know, I never guessed
you'd be back so soon.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.539
Hazel exudes a certain
seductive quality,

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:43.974
wouldn't you agree?

01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:46.643
She is a very beautiful girl.

01:00:46.677 --> 01:00:48.445
You got that right.

01:01:03.728 --> 01:01:07.798
* Lullaby by birdland
that's what I *

01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:12.102
* Always hear, when you sigh

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:16.340
* Never in my wordland could
there be ways to reveal *

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:20.778
* In a phrase how I feel

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:25.015
- How did you get into the
crime fighting business?

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:29.586
- To be perfectly
honest, crime bores me.

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:32.589
I'd rather be
photographing nature.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:37.795
* When we kiss

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:41.265
* And there's
a weepy old willow *

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:42.833
Crime is nature.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:50.440
* That's how I'd
cry in my pillow *

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:54.678
* If you should tell
me farewell and goodbye *

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:57.414
So,

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:02.252
you get off watching
people's deep dark secrets.

01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:04.822
Watching is my line of work.

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:09.426
What do you see?

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:16.834
'Cause um,

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.137
you know what I think?

01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:27.511
I think you been thinking about
me a lot since we last met.

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:31.916
Touch my dick.

01:02:33.851 --> 01:02:34.718
Seriously.

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:41.058
Touch my dick.

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:53.670
Relax, I just wanted to
see we could work together.

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:56.273
Now.

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:03.347
Let's find out who killed Merle.

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:19.396
- You never told me
you'd been to Japan.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.973
Were you in love with her?

01:03:33.577 --> 01:03:35.345
She's very beautiful.

01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:41.251
- It's really not
that important, it

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:43.153
It's before I met you.

01:03:45.022 --> 01:03:46.857
Where'd you find this?

01:03:47.892 --> 01:03:50.027
I went to her memorial.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:55.465
I thought someone should
represent the family.

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:03.840
I thought we talked about

01:04:03.874 --> 01:04:06.911
not having secrets
in this marriage.

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:11.949
What's worse than anything is

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:15.019
you've been keeping
yourself secret.

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:54.324
Come on.

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:58.862
- What is his
fucking problem?

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.097
Who?

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:01.098
Bird boy.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:05.902
- Don't worry about it,
I'm taking care of him.

01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:07.604
I fucking hope so.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:11.775
If it wasn't for him,
Merle would still be alive.

01:05:12.676 --> 01:05:15.045
Do you like to tango, Tom?

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:20.084
I can show you the secret.

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:24.921
All the mystery that
lives below our waists.

01:05:27.024 --> 01:05:28.092
- I feel like I need
to tell you that

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:31.061
I have to turn down your
father's sponsorship offer.

01:05:31.095 --> 01:05:35.299
- Mm, babe, is that the only
reason you came to see me?

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:38.302
In a way,

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:42.272
I feel like I'm honoring
Merle's last wishes,

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:46.143
but I think it's even
bigger than Merle.

01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:48.878
I know what you did, you know.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.150
Boom.

01:05:57.221 --> 01:05:59.489
You've been a bad boy, Tom.

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:04.194
I can make you feel better.

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:16.373
I did nothing.

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:21.411
I know.

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:27.217
I know.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.388
I know.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.560
- I think this is what
you're looking for.

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:39.129
Next time you should just ask.

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:51.675
Now nothing happens
for 48 minutes.

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:54.778
Which is a little
bit impressive,

01:06:54.811 --> 01:06:57.514
I didn't think he had it in him.

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:07.757
See, the next thing you
know, Merle is dead.

01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:16.200
- What else did you
find out about the cowboy?

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:20.437
- Bob McIntyre either had
scruples, or he was just dumb.

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:23.873
Other ranchers had been
bribed into allowing

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:26.643
Futron Energy to
frack on their land.

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:30.414
The cowboy was under
considerable pressure.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.649
Tom and Merle had
convinced him it was wrong.

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:35.252
Then Starling threw in
Hazel to sweeten the deal,

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:39.489
and she turned out to be
an even bigger influence.

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:42.826
Oh, and I found out that
fracking causes earthquakes.

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:02.646
Geez, what do you get out

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:05.649
of such a ideological
rigid agenda?

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:09.719
Have you ever heard
of ethical oil?

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:12.522
People need oil,
they demand oil.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:14.691
I tell you, I hate
to see my daughters

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:18.528
living under some repressive
regime in the Middle East.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:22.666
No, I can't quite
picture you in burkas.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.968
- What
was Mr. James like?

01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:27.103
- He was a captain
of industry type.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:29.005
- You're destroying
everything I care about.

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:32.008
- Inscrutable,
Machiavellian, philanthropist.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.777
Merle, come on, let's go.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:34.778
Merle please.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:37.247
- It was obvious that he
and Merle had had some

01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:39.849
professional disagreements,
but he seemed to adore her,

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:40.750
and Hazel.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:45.488
- My dear, those who
provide are the anointed.

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:52.060
And those who don't appreciate
it can go fuck themselves.

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:58.667
- Sabotage is just
the beginning.

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:04.308
- I think it's time
to do a little tally

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:06.210
on the old mental
scorecard here.

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:09.345
So, Tom's resume, his
biography if you will,

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:11.348
he is an ornithologist
who works at

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:13.983
the natural history museum, who

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:17.587
at the time of Merle's
death claims he was working

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:20.323
on his dino-bird exhibit, right?

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:26.630
Did you ever see that
show, What's My Line?

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:27.531
Kind of.

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:32.435
- So, on your episode
here, let's call it that,

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:36.072
you decide not to ask
any questions at all.

01:09:36.973 --> 01:09:38.608
Instead, detective,

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.712
you suspect your husband
of having an affair

01:09:42.746 --> 01:09:46.049
and you begin to
surveil your marriage.

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:49.386
So Tom's mistress
Merle, she just,

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:51.955
she falls from a bridge
and just gets hit

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:54.858
by an oncoming train and
her body just magically

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:58.962
ends up in Tom's possession
in a fridge at the museum.

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:03.032
Not to mention Tom
also bashes in the head

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.868
of Merle's boyfriend Starling,

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:07.103
and this is my favorite part,

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:11.341
Tom uses Hazel, Merle's sister,
for his blue kimono fetish.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:16.980
- Did you come here
to see me, or Merle?

01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:21.951
- Tom's motivation
for murdering Starling

01:10:21.985 --> 01:10:23.687
was all spelled out.

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:26.390
Jealous rage, revenge.

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:31.928
Not to mention his
connection to Merle's death.

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:37.334
And what is your
part in all this?

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:42.138
By the way, does Tom
own a gray sports coat?

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:19.669
- Don't you just love
to fuck tragic women?

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:24.841
Makes me kind of hard
just thinking about it.

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:28.412
So what do you
think makes people

01:12:28.445 --> 01:12:31.648
stick together in
marriage like swans?

01:12:32.516 --> 01:12:33.950
'Cause personally I
don't want people to read

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:36.753
in my obituary that
I snapped my neck

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:39.423
tripping on some
fucking baby toy.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:00.777
Go on.

01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:09.653
The boy's an old hand.

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:41.184
Where's your Tom?

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:04.107
- You have had
too much to drink.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.343
Why don't you go
upstairs to my suite.

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:11.781
Take her with you
and straighten out.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:46.983
I like you.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:48.685
You do?

01:14:50.353 --> 01:14:53.022
What do you like about me?

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:55.091
You're smart.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.492
You're stunning.

01:14:57.661 --> 01:14:58.795
Just like me.

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:54.117
Say goodbye to Merle.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:14.537
What about your husband?

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:18.107
Tom, does he uh, like
to fuck other women?

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.481
Oh wait, this is
payback sex, isn't it?

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:28.284
Sauce for the
goose and all that.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.557
Fuck you and your
murdering husband.

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:37.293
Where's Merle's ring,
you rotten cunt?

01:16:46.703 --> 01:16:48.237
Tom is a dead man.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.588
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

01:17:13.697 --> 01:17:17.667
- We finally tracked down
Starling's cameraman.

01:17:19.435 --> 01:17:20.804
No, no!

01:17:20.837 --> 01:17:23.406
Merle, wait, come here.

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:24.307
Come here!

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:21.757
- Do you have
something to tell me?

01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:33.002
- She came to the
museum a few months ago.

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:38.541
How many months?

01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:44.213
How many months?

01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:46.249
I don't know.

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:47.150
A while.

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:54.623
She came to convince me to

01:19:57.393 --> 01:19:59.628
convince the museum

01:19:59.662 --> 01:20:03.833
to withdraw from her
father's sponsorship.

01:20:03.867 --> 01:20:05.902
And she had some coke.

01:20:25.388 --> 01:20:27.023
What happened next?

01:20:32.695 --> 01:20:34.730
You started fucking her.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:40.536
How awkward, I
can't even imagine

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:42.872
how your parts got
stuck together.

01:20:42.906 --> 01:20:44.073
Just stop it.

01:20:44.107 --> 01:20:44.974
Why?

01:20:46.943 --> 01:20:47.810
Tom, why

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:49.946
did you?

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:54.951
Sheila.

01:20:58.421 --> 01:20:59.522
I was stoned.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:02.391
Why didn't you stop it?

01:21:02.425 --> 01:21:04.393
What did you do to stop it?

01:21:04.427 --> 01:21:05.728
I,

01:21:05.761 --> 01:21:06.695
I couldn't.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:09.665
I couldn't.

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.967
You couldn't.

01:21:11.935 --> 01:21:14.203
You couldn't, you couldn't,

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:16.739
you couldn't what?

01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:22.045
What, were you fucking
her to save the planet?

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:45.134
When I first started
filming Tom I felt like,

01:21:45.168 --> 01:21:49.372
by filming my marriage, I
could somehow protect it.

01:21:52.275 --> 01:21:54.777
But the more I capture the
things that were going on,

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:57.947
the more things
appeared that I feared,

01:21:57.981 --> 01:22:00.016
that I couldn't control.

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:42.992
No!

01:23:48.824 --> 01:23:50.093
We're asleep
throughout our lives

01:23:50.126 --> 01:23:54.097
and it's only in
death that we wake up,

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:58.000
just like we wake up
from sleep every morning.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.140
This is a wake.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:05.908
For Merle,

01:24:08.111 --> 01:24:08.977
Starling,

01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:14.917
and anyone and anything who
ever has died or ever will die.

01:24:22.925 --> 01:24:24.693
Death is not the end.

01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:30.166
Wakes are for the living.

01:25:26.155 --> 01:25:29.692
* You've loved me forever

01:25:30.726 --> 01:25:33.596
* Until I ran dry

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:40.936
* Then you said
goodbye for another *

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:53.148
* You held me so tightly

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:57.386
* Until I asked why

01:26:00.356 --> 01:26:04.560
* Then you said
goodbye for another *

01:26:08.364 --> 01:26:10.899
* And another

01:26:13.469 --> 01:26:15.671
* Goodbye

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.376
* For another

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:26.114
* When no other would do

01:26:32.087 --> 01:26:34.290
* Goodbye

01:26:36.759 --> 01:26:39.295
* For another

01:26:41.364 --> 01:26:43.966
* But no other

01:26:45.734 --> 01:26:48.371
* Came through

01:27:14.797 --> 01:27:16.999
* Goodbye

01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:22.004
* For another

01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:26.342
* When no other

01:27:28.811 --> 01:27:31.079
* Would do

01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:36.118
* Goodbye

01:27:38.354 --> 01:27:40.889
* For another

01:27:42.658 --> 01:27:45.294
* But no other

01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:49.932
* Came through

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:56.472
* You've loved me forever

01:27:57.673 --> 01:28:00.543
* Until I ran dry

01:28:03.379 --> 01:28:07.583
* Then you said
goodbye for another *

01:28:11.587 --> 01:28:14.122
* And another

01:28:16.859 --> 01:28:19.795
* Before I ran dry

01:28:20.305 --> 01:28:26.908
