- [crickets chirping]

00:41.458 --> 00:42.958
[blows]

00:44.042 --> 00:45.958
You know he's not gonna be happy.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.417
[man] No, I suspect he won't.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.833
Only you can decide
what's best for you, Jesse.

00:54.792 --> 00:56.167
Not him, not me.

01:01.958 --> 01:02.958
I'm out.

01:09.917 --> 01:11.833
So, what are you gonna do
with all that money?

01:14.125 --> 01:16.250
Same thing I do with all the other money.

01:16.625 --> 01:19.375
How about you, teenage retiree?

01:19.708 --> 01:21.333
You'll be living the dream.

01:21.417 --> 01:22.417
[chuckles]

01:23.917 --> 01:26.208
Not sure I should stick around town.

01:27.167 --> 01:28.458
That's a start.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.833
Nothing really keeping me here.

01:33.375 --> 01:34.500
Where would you go?

01:35.500 --> 01:36.583
If you were me.

01:37.208 --> 01:40.125
- [Mike] Doesn't matter. I'm not you.
- [Jesse] Seriously, come on.

01:40.208 --> 01:41.667
Like, if you were my age.

01:42.708 --> 01:43.708
Just play along.

01:43.958 --> 01:45.208
Make some conversation.

01:47.417 --> 01:48.458
Alaska.

01:50.292 --> 01:51.292
Yeah?

01:52.125 --> 01:54.583
Yeah, if I were your age, starting fresh,

01:55.583 --> 01:56.583
Alaska.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.000
It's the last frontier.

02:00.042 --> 02:01.958
Up there, you could be anything you want.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.042
[Jesse] Alaska.

02:07.750 --> 02:08.750
Start over.

02:10.125 --> 02:12.167
- Start fresh.
- [Mike] One could.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.500
Put things right.

02:17.667 --> 02:18.667
[Mike] No.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.958
Sorry, kid, that's the one thing
you can never do.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.333
[screaming]

02:50.708 --> 02:51.833
[brakes squeal]

02:52.667 --> 02:53.750

- [man 1 cackles]

03:31.750 --> 03:33.125
Dude, you suck.

03:33.542 --> 03:35.792
[man 2]
This thing's, like, defective and shit.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.917
Think you got Cheeto dust
in the controller.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.167
[blowing]

03:40.250 --> 03:42.708
It's a bad carpenter
that blames his hammer, yo.

03:42.792 --> 03:43.792
Whatever.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.500
You're apexing too early.
You're apexing too early.

03:46.583 --> 03:50.250
I'm apexing at the apex, bitch.
Don't be telling me how to drive and shit.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.625
[scoffs]
You couldn't drive a two-button elevator.

03:53.042 --> 03:54.583
You couldn't drive Miss Daisy.

03:55.167 --> 03:56.500
Whatever that means.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.042
You couldn't drive a short bus
full of slow kids to the zoo.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.458
Yeah, because I'd be
too distracted by you.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.542
You'd be sitting up front,
in your special helmet,

04:04.625 --> 04:05.917
trying to hump my leg.

04:06.625 --> 04:10.500
On account you couldn't drive
Thelma and Louise off of that cliff. Apex!

04:10.583 --> 04:13.000
I can't apex more
than I'm already apexing.

04:13.125 --> 04:16.166
[sighs]
You drive like a blind guy with no legs.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.625
Dude, you...
you drive like my dead grandmoms.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.083
That's disrespectful.

04:39.792 --> 04:41.792
[heavy breathing]

04:45.292 --> 04:47.083
[knocking]

04:59.125 --> 05:00.167
Dude, you lost?

05:02.458 --> 05:03.458
[Badger] Who is it?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Jesse?

05:09.833 --> 05:10.833
[Badger] Who is it?

05:10.917 --> 05:12.167
[door creaks]

05:16.333 --> 05:18.417
[Jesse]
I gotta get that car off the street.

05:19.708 --> 05:21.833
[Skinny Pete grunting]

05:28.375 --> 05:30.125
[dog barks in distance]

05:40.542 --> 05:42.268
- [thuds]
- [Skinny Pete whispers] What the hell, yo?

05:42.292 --> 05:44.292
[Jesse grunting]

05:49.125 --> 05:50.583
[slurping]

06:11.833 --> 06:13.625
[whispering]
Come check out what's on TV.

06:13.708 --> 06:16.583
Man, what's wrong with you?
I ain't watching no TV right now.

06:17.083 --> 06:18.208
It's the news.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.417
[footsteps retreat]

06:35.625 --> 06:37.893
[female reporter]
<i>Is it true that a military grade firearm</i>

06:37.917 --> 06:39.792
<i>was altered and used
to carry out this attack?</i>

06:40.292 --> 06:42.542
<i>To the best of my knowledge,
it was an M60 machine gun,</i>

06:42.625 --> 06:45.125
<i>which, yes,
that's strictly a military issue weapon.</i>

06:45.208 --> 06:47.583
<i>As to where he could have obtained
such a weapon,</i>

06:47.667 --> 06:50.542
<i>or the so-called "remote control"
aspect of it,</i>

06:50.625 --> 06:53.167
<i>anything I could say at this point
would just be conjecture,</i>

06:53.250 --> 06:55.730
<i>- and I'm not going to engage in that. Yes?</i>
- [press clamoring]

06:55.875 --> 06:58.792
[male reporter] <i>Could you tell us more</i>
<i>about this person of interest?</i>

06:59.417 --> 07:01.833
<i>We're hearing a lot
of conflicting information</i>

07:01.917 --> 07:04.833
<i>and I'm unclear whether this person
took part in the killings,</i>

07:04.917 --> 07:06.500
<i>or whether they were, in fact,</i>

07:06.583 --> 07:09.000
<i>I guess the word
we keep hearing is "liberated."</i>

07:09.083 --> 07:10.123
[camera shutters snapping]

07:10.167 --> 07:13.875
<i>Were they liberated by White
from some sort of captivity?</i>

07:13.958 --> 07:16.351
[Sac Ramey] <i> I'm not prepared,</i>

[Badger]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Jesse!

08:08.167 --> 08:10.184
- [shouting] Who's there?
- Hey! It's cool man, it's us!

08:10.208 --> 08:12.375
[Skinny Pete] It's us.
It's us, Jesse, you're safe.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.125
- [panting]
- [Skinny Pete] It's us.

[panting]

08:26.667 --> 08:27.667
[clanks]

08:33.582 --> 08:35.875
My stuff's gonna fit you like a T, yo.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.167
Not like if you had to borrow it
from Sasquatch over here.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.167
Can't help it that I'm sized for love.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.750
Yeah, you go love
all the giraffes you want, bitch.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.208
Me and Jesse are sticking with the ladies.

08:48.417 --> 08:50.000
Yeah, this here's barely worn.

08:50.750 --> 08:51.833
How's this working for you?

08:52.917 --> 08:53.917
Good?

08:55.708 --> 08:56.708
[Skinny Pete] Jesse?

09:00.208 --> 09:01.083
Right on.

09:01.167 --> 09:02.833
Get you some new clothes then.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.375
Shower will make you feel
a whole lot better.

09:07.875 --> 09:09.915
Truth be told,
you look like you're hurting for one.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.167
Church.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.583
No offense.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.625
Got you a clean towel,
the one on the right. Well, kinda.

09:18.708 --> 09:21.708
And feel free to open up
a new bar of Irish Spring, whatever.

09:21.792 --> 09:22.832
It's underneath, you know.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.792
'Cause the old one might have,
like, hairs on it and shit, and uh,

09:25.917 --> 09:27.750
yo, I got Axe body spray,

09:27.833 --> 09:30.292
I got Obsession for Men,
I got Tommy Hilfinger.

09:30.375 --> 09:33.250
Feel free to use any of 'em you want,
you know? Use 'em all.

09:33.708 --> 09:36.542
Obsession's the bomb, yo.
I got it for him for Christmas.

09:37.917 --> 09:40.042
Oh, uh, hey, um...

09:41.542 --> 09:44.042
Maybe don't, like,
shave and whatnot, you know?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.125
Uh, be less recognizable?

09:50.208 --> 09:52.375
Jesse, did they really...

09:55.708 --> 09:56.708
What?

09:59.292 --> 10:01.042
Did they really keep you in a cage?

10:33.542 --> 10:35.625
[men chuckling] Yeah!

10:35.833 --> 10:36.833
Woo hoo!

10:36.875 --> 10:37.875
No!

10:38.292 --> 10:40.375
[panting]

11:12.625 --> 11:15.042
- Whoa, dude. Why'd you...
- Looking sharp, yo.

11:18.792 --> 11:20.375
Yeah, looking sharp.

11:21.833 --> 11:23.125
Feel like a new man?

11:24.083 --> 11:25.667
Yeah. Thanks.

11:26.042 --> 11:28.042
Want a little something,
take the edge off?

11:30.083 --> 11:31.083
No.

11:32.167 --> 11:33.958
Why'd you, uh, turn off the TV?

11:35.708 --> 11:36.792
News that bad?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.083
There's just, uh... a whole lot of it.

11:40.792 --> 11:41.792
[Jesse] Yeah.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.000
I gotta get out of here.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.333
Where to? You got a plan?

11:48.417 --> 11:49.417
[Jesse] Maybe.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.042
Hey, uh, Skinny,

12:04.750 --> 12:06.333
you got a burner you can give me?

12:08.833 --> 12:10.750
Fully charged and clean as a whistle.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.875
[phone keypad beeping]

12:13.125 --> 12:15.833

Look, thank you so much

13:29.625 --> 13:31.125
About the money, if we can maybe...

It's on the house.

13:35.708 --> 13:36.708
Good kid.

Least I can do.

[Skinny Pete] Watch it, bitch!

13:46.125 --> 13:48.351
[Joe] You gentlemen threw me
plenty of business back in the day.

13:48.375 --> 13:50.667
- [beeps]
- I got no complaints in that department.

"Magnets!"

13:53.167 --> 13:54.167
Yeah.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.375
That was a good one. So...

13:57.167 --> 13:59.583
Frankly, you know, I can tell you now,

14:01.083 --> 14:02.763
I had zero confidence that
that would work.

14:02.833 --> 14:06.375
None whatsoever, but hey, live and learn.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.667
Joe, what are you doing?

14:07.750 --> 14:09.792
Writing myself a little insurance policy.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.875
You know, strictly precautionary.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.250
Belt and suspenders.

14:15.333 --> 14:16.333
Okay.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.667
All right, mind at ease, think we're good.

- [rapid beeping]
- Whoa.

Joe! Joe!

[panting] Wait.

14:33.917 --> 14:36.625
- [whispering] Joe, what are you doing?
- [starts engine]

14:36.708 --> 14:38.958
Fleeing, and I suggest you do the same.

14:39.042 --> 14:42.292
LoJack. The company just activated it,
just this minute.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.250
Talk about timing.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.208
- Just...
- Look, Johnny Law is on his way,

14:47.292 --> 14:48.792
as in here, as in now.

14:48.875 --> 14:51.083
So farewell, goodbye, regrets,

14:51.167 --> 14:52.417
etcetera etcetera.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.292
[Jesse] Joe!

Skinny...

15:08.917 --> 15:09.917
[sighs]

15:11.083 --> 15:12.083
Sorry.

15:12.375 --> 15:13.833
Who's got the keys to that car?

15:14.792 --> 15:15.792
Keys!

15:29.083 --> 15:32.000
Yo. Yo! What are you doing?
We gotta get this thing outta here.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.208
[snapping]
Badger, give me the keys to your Fiero.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.333
[Badger] Why?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.375
[Badger sighs]

15:37.500 --> 15:38.375
You take my car.

15:38.458 --> 15:39.833
I don't even like your car.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.708
Drives like a dick.

15:41.792 --> 15:45.042
Badger drives my T-bird
200, 300 miles away and ditches it.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.750
Think you'll be heading to Mexico?

15:46.833 --> 15:48.208
[Jesse] No, not Mexico.

15:48.667 --> 15:49.917
Right on, even better.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.125
Leave it near the border.

15:51.208 --> 15:52.208
Hide it, kind of,

15:52.250 --> 15:55.000
but, yo, don't hide it so good
the cops can't find it.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.250
Wipe it down for prints,
then hitchhike back.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.333
Do not let nobody see you in that car.

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.917
Detectives? Everything okay?

01:00:31.667 --> 01:00:33.167
[door opens]

01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:36.333
Uh, sorry about that, sir. We're...

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.792
dusting for fingerprints, you know?
It's a delicate process.

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:42.750
I thought your CSI boys do that.

01:00:42.833 --> 01:00:44.625
Didn't they get 'em all yesterday?

01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:48.625
Yeah, well, you know, sometimes,
you want something done right...

01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:50.292
Oh, God, tell me about it.

01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:53.125
My line was restaurant
and hospitality supplies,

01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:54.708
so I completely get it.

01:00:55.167 --> 01:00:59.375
Hey, listen, I just came across
an old note Todd Alquist wrote me.

01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:01.458
- Figured it may be of interest.
- Oh, really?

01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:02.542
Yeah.

01:01:02.583 --> 01:01:05.750
Sort of a half-assed apology
he slipped under my door.

01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:09.042
I'd gone to our landlord
about this stupid truck cap of his

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:11.083
everybody kept tripping over, and...

01:01:11.792 --> 01:01:15.917
Well, anyway, if you need
a handwriting sample for analysis.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.208
That's... Yeah, yeah, that could be...

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.125
- Yeah, sure.
- Left it inside.

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:23.083
Didn't want to touch it,
speaking of fingerprints.

01:01:23.667 --> 01:01:25.417
You're welcome to come examine it.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.750
Oh, it's no trouble. I got time.

01:01:41.167 --> 01:01:43.250
Show me the money, I let you go.

01:01:46.208 --> 01:01:47.208
Hey.

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.000
What do you say, huh?

01:01:49.625 --> 01:01:50.875
Seems pretty fair to me.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:53.625
[thuds]

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.500
[quietly grunting]

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:19.125
Oh, shit!

01:02:19.875 --> 01:02:22.292
- Holy shit!
- Keep your voice down.

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:24.458
[groans] God, there's gotta be...

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.750
there's gotta be a million here. Yeah.

01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:33.083
[grunts]

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.208
What are you doing?

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:42.583
- Taking my half.
- [Neil] Wow.

01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:44.333
[chuckling] Yeah?

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:47.542
A little man with big dreams? Yeah?

01:02:47.958 --> 01:02:49.667
Hey, if I were you,

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.167
I'd walk the hell outta here right now.

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.458
I'll shoot you, you son of a bitch.

01:03:02.167 --> 01:03:03.917
I will shoot you.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.625
Then do it already.

01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:10.500
If I don't get this money,

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:12.417
I am dead anyway.

01:03:12.792 --> 01:03:14.708
All right? If you pull that trigger,

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:19.000
then you are gonna have to kill
that loudmouth down the hall

01:03:19.083 --> 01:03:21.417
and every other witness in the place.

01:03:21.708 --> 01:03:25.208
Then you will be as fucked as I am.

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:28.375
So...

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:31.458
what's it gonna be?

01:03:44.917 --> 01:03:48.292
Three-way split. And you got your third.

01:03:50.083 --> 01:03:51.083
Don't push it.

01:04:14.542 --> 01:04:15.958
[beeps]

01:04:16.542 --> 01:04:18.083
[ringing]

01:04:18.292 --> 01:04:20.417
- [Casey] <i>Yep?</i>
- Don't react, just listen.

01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:23.375
<i>I got the money.</i>

01:04:23.833 --> 01:04:25.893
<i>You gotta keep him talking
for the next five minutes.</i>

01:04:25.917 --> 01:04:27.375
Since I got the Brita,

01:04:27.667 --> 01:04:30.500
I find the tea tastes noticeably better.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.458
Not a problem.

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:19.167
You got balls, I'll give you that.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.292
Can I get my gun back?

01:05:23.042 --> 01:05:25.458
Fuck you. Go buy one.

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:56.000
I was wondering
when you were gonna remember me.

01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:04.333
[keys jangling]

01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:08.958
[engine starts]

01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:33.792
[brakes squeal]

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:33.042
[tires screech]

01:07:53.708 --> 01:07:56.208
[panting]

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:06.250
[woman] <i> It's colorful, I'll say that much.</i>

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:08.250
[man] Yes, it is.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:11.208
Uh, I don't expect
you'd ever lose it in your closet.

01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:14.750
Mm. And no dirt bag to replace?

01:08:14.833 --> 01:08:15.917
[man] That's correct.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.917
A lot of our customers find that handy
and practical.

01:08:19.582 --> 01:08:22.207
But they want an arm and a leg
to pay for it.

01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:24.332
And I ain't paying for no paint job.

01:08:24.457 --> 01:08:26.667
Yes, I agree. It's very expensive.

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.250
But it's a fine product.

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:31.292
However, if you are in love
with your Kirby,

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:33.667
I'll bet I could get it
working for you again.

01:08:34.417 --> 01:08:36.292
Uh, be with you in a minute.

01:08:37.125 --> 01:08:39.832
Fixing my Kirby,
how much would that cost?

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:44.000
Well, I won't know
until I take a good look at it, and it...

01:08:44.542 --> 01:08:47.625
and if it needed a new motor,
it'd be a little bit expensive,

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.917
but certainly not as expensive
as a new Dyson.

01:08:51.332 --> 01:08:53.750
The estimate's free, and...

01:08:53.917 --> 01:08:55.625
all you gotta do is bring it in here.

01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:57.792
- I may take you up on that.
- Excellent.

01:08:57.875 --> 01:09:01.042
If I can get my niece to help me.
They make 'em so heavy.

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:02.167
Yes, they do,

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:04.957
and I want you to promise
you won't try to bring it in by yourself.

01:09:05.042 --> 01:09:06.832
- Get that help.
- [woman] Hm.

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:11.292
I just don't know why they can't
make things to last anymore.

01:09:11.417 --> 01:09:13.417
Oh! You're singing my song.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.667
[woman chuckles]

01:09:15.167 --> 01:09:16.768
[man] I want you to have a great day now.

01:09:16.792 --> 01:09:19.250
Thank you, thanks for your help.
I'll be back with my Kirby.

01:09:19.332 --> 01:09:21.332
[man] Excellent. Drive carefully.

01:09:23.832 --> 01:09:26.582
If there's any questions I can answer,
just let me know.

01:09:45.082 --> 01:09:47.042
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that.

01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:49.375
I'm open for business.

01:09:54.417 --> 01:09:56.000
Um, I'm looking for a...

01:09:56.958 --> 01:09:58.042
Hoover Max.

01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:00.833
Pressure Max, Max Pressure.

01:10:00.917 --> 01:10:02.542
Hoover, or maybe it's a Pro Max.

01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:04.333
Got like a... like a filter.

01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:08.542
Hoover products are right over there
on the wall behind you.

01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:10.958
Look, I don't remember
the exact, like, password.

01:10:11.417 --> 01:10:13.083
All right? But it was a vacuum thing.

01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:17.667
Okay, fine.

01:10:18.667 --> 01:10:19.667
Here you go.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.500
Four...

01:10:26.042 --> 01:10:27.042
six...

01:10:28.917 --> 01:10:29.917
ten...

01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:34.292
fourteen,

01:10:34.792 --> 01:10:36.792
sixteen, eighteen,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.250
twenty, twenty-two...

01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:43.042
twenty-four, twenty-five.

01:10:43.375 --> 01:10:44.417
There you go.

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:46.000
$125,000.

01:10:47.792 --> 01:10:49.500
Come on, man, you know why I'm here.

01:10:50.792 --> 01:10:52.708
I can't say I do, no.

01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:55.000
Yeah, you do. You're the guy.

01:10:56.708 --> 01:10:58.125
Yeah, you do.

01:10:58.458 --> 01:10:59.792
You're the guy.

01:11:02.042 --> 01:11:04.583
Look, I am 96 percent sure
that you are the guy,

01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:06.500
so why don't you just, like, admit it?

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:09.500
[slams hand]

01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:11.708
Look, all right, no wire.

01:11:12.042 --> 01:11:13.833
Okay? No wire.

01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:15.208
And no gun.

01:11:15.292 --> 01:11:17.208
Okay? And nobody knows I'm here.

01:11:17.667 --> 01:11:18.667
I just need...

01:11:19.292 --> 01:11:20.833
just need your services.

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:24.542
The day at the pickup spot,
you pulled up in a minivan,

01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:26.458
a red Toyota minivan.

01:11:26.542 --> 01:11:27.958
Looks like a kidney bean.

01:11:28.042 --> 01:11:30.833
Same exact minivan
you got parked out back.

01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:32.458
All right? I saw it.

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:36.000
[sighs] All right.

01:11:36.833 --> 01:11:38.833
You got rules. All right.

01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:43.250
I get that, and I apologize, seriously.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.000
I didn't go with you that day,
and I am sorry.

01:11:47.458 --> 01:11:50.583
Look, you will never know how sorry,

01:11:50.875 --> 01:11:53.083
but I am here now.

01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:55.333
All right? And I have cash.

01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:57.583
So, please?

01:11:58.083 --> 01:11:59.083
Okay?

01:11:59.292 --> 01:12:00.333
Please?

01:12:08.708 --> 01:12:11.792
- You owe me for that first pickup.
- Yes! [exclaims]

01:12:11.875 --> 01:12:13.000
You're the gu...

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:15.583
- Wait, what?
- This...

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.750
is previously-owed.

01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.125
Going forward,

01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:25.792
were we to,

01:12:27.167 --> 01:12:30.542
would require an additional 125.

01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:37.167
All right.

01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:38.375
Fair is fair.

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:41.042
A deal's a deal.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.583
All right. Look...

01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:45.083
Four...

01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:49.917
eight...

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:52.167
ten,

01:12:52.667 --> 01:12:54.417
fourteen, eighteen...

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:56.750
twenty...

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
twenty...

01:13:06.458 --> 01:13:07.458
Twenty-two.

01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:11.708
Twenty-two.

01:13:12.833 --> 01:13:13.833
Yeah.

01:13:15.042 --> 01:13:16.167
[muttering]

01:13:16.542 --> 01:13:17.625
Twenty-three.

01:13:17.917 --> 01:13:21.375
By my arithmetic, you're $10,000 shy.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.250
[sighs]

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:31.542
[rustling in pockets]

01:13:31.667 --> 01:13:32.958
[mutters]

01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:35.375
[panting]

01:13:51.292 --> 01:13:52.333
Eighty-two hundred.

01:13:54.833 --> 01:13:56.000
Eighty-two hundred.

01:14:00.792 --> 01:14:02.000
May I borrow this?

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:10.792
[Jesse] What are you doing?

01:14:11.292 --> 01:14:14.000
[man] I'm gathering your belongings.

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:15.792
[Jesse] No, no no. No, no. Stop.

01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:18.167
I'm not gonna try to collect
what you owe me.

01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:21.208
I don't think it would end well
for either one of us.

01:14:21.667 --> 01:14:23.958
This is not an inconsequential
amount of money.

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:25.042
Hey, listen to me.

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:27.792
Spend it wisely,
it will last you for years.

01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:29.625
Please, you don't understand.

01:14:29.708 --> 01:14:32.583
Keep a low profile, travel by night.

01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:33.875
[under breath] Oh, God.

01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:36.000
With a little luck,

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:40.167
you will soon find yourself
many miles from here.

01:14:41.833 --> 01:14:43.250
Godspeed to you.

01:14:46.292 --> 01:14:47.125
So that's it?

01:14:47.208 --> 01:14:48.208
That's it.

01:14:49.333 --> 01:14:50.458
Now, please leave.

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:53.750
You are going to jack me up

01:14:54.292 --> 01:14:56.875
over a measly $1,800?

01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:00.500
I've got to reopen.

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.208
The longer you stick around here,

01:15:03.292 --> 01:15:05.208
the more you jeopardize yourself.

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:06.708
[Jesse] No, hey...

01:15:08.292 --> 01:15:09.500
[lock clicks, door dings]

01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:10.792
No. Hey...

01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:14.208
Have you been watching the news?

01:15:14.292 --> 01:15:16.000
I have. Very much so.

01:15:16.125 --> 01:15:18.167
So you hear
what they've been saying about me.

01:15:19.875 --> 01:15:21.333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:23.625
Look, these people,

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.500
they have kept me in a concrete hole.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.292
Look, I don't even know what month it is.

01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:35.000
They made me watch when they...
when they shot someone...

01:15:35.083 --> 01:15:38.042
If you believe that you can
pull on people's heartstrings,

01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:40.333
you should take your chances
with the police.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:43.542
From where I sit, you made your own luck.

01:15:44.333 --> 01:15:46.083
As did your former partner.

01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:47.917
As did your lawyer.

01:15:49.375 --> 01:15:51.833
You said it yourself, a deal's a deal.

01:15:53.792 --> 01:15:54.792
No.

01:15:56.875 --> 01:15:58.042
[clicks lock]

01:15:58.167 --> 01:16:00.625
I am not going anywhere.

01:16:02.083 --> 01:16:04.083
I am staying right here

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:06.333
until you help me.

01:16:07.917 --> 01:16:10.875
[panting]

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.083
[buttons beeping]

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:18.500
[Jesse] What are you doing?

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:23.542
Hi, yes.

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:26.375
There's a young man in my store,

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:28.000
and he refuses to leave.

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:29.542
[whispering] Hey, stop.

01:16:29.625 --> 01:16:30.625
I...

01:16:31.375 --> 01:16:33.750
- Yeah, he might be armed.
- Stop it.

01:16:34.542 --> 01:16:35.917
Uh, not overtly.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.542
But, yes,
I'm beginning to feel threatened.

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:40.625
- [Jesse] Are you serious?
- Sure.

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:42.542
My name is Ed Galbraith.

01:16:42.625 --> 01:16:45.250
I own Best Quality Vacuum,

01:16:45.333 --> 01:16:48.458
2714, 4th Street.

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:50.625
Northwest. That's correct.

01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:55.125
I would appreciate it very much
if you'd send someone immediately.

01:16:58.083 --> 01:16:59.083
[beeps]

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:03.417
[Ed sighs]

01:17:12.583 --> 01:17:15.625
You are so full of crap.

01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:18.042
You didn't call anybody just now.

01:17:18.625 --> 01:17:19.625
You faked it.

01:17:19.792 --> 01:17:21.375
And you wanna know how I know?

01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:24.458
You got as much to lose as I do.

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:27.083
More. Way more.

01:17:27.167 --> 01:17:30.708
When your "cops" get here
and they bust me,

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:34.417
first question they're gonna ask
is what am I doing here,

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.875
trying to hand over
a Hefty bag full of cash

01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:40.167
to a dude who runs
a vacuum cleaner store.

01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:42.792
What comes out then? Huh?

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:44.625
[chuckles]

01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:47.208
Oh, and you, uh, wanna know
what else is bullshit?

01:17:47.292 --> 01:17:49.292
You know, like, word to the wise:

01:17:49.375 --> 01:17:52.417
next time to try to pull this shit
on someone,

01:17:53.125 --> 01:17:56.417
you don't just hang up on a 9-1-1 call.

01:17:57.208 --> 01:17:58.333
They won't let you.

01:17:58.417 --> 01:18:03.208
Because the lady, or dude, or whoever
is like, "Stay on the line with me, sir.

01:18:03.292 --> 01:18:06.500
Stay on the line
until the officers arrive."

01:18:06.958 --> 01:18:10.500
And if you did hang up,
they'd call you back immediately.

01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:12.792
But, hey, guess what?

01:18:12.875 --> 01:18:15.792
Seriously, yo. Pathetic.

01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:20.792
Wow, you gotta love that response time.

01:18:23.875 --> 01:18:24.875
[Ed] Take your money.

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:35.583
[door opens and closes at distance]

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.917
Officers, thank you very much
for getting here so fast.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.375
- He obviously heard my call and...
- Is he still here?

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:46.833
No, he's not, he's gone. I, uh...

01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:49.917
Uh, he was spooked by my phone call

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.333
and he headed up northbound, uh...

01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:55.458
on foot maybe 30 seconds ago.

01:18:55.542 --> 01:18:57.583
- Can you describe him?
- Uh, sure I can.

01:18:57.667 --> 01:18:58.667
He was, uh...

01:18:59.333 --> 01:19:01.292
young, uh, he's white,

01:19:01.375 --> 01:19:03.250
skinny, very tall guy.

01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:04.917
Six-five, six-six.

01:19:05.083 --> 01:19:07.333
Had a tattoo over his right eyebrow.

01:19:07.417 --> 01:19:12.000
- Interesting. A large insect.
- [siren chirps]

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.667
[phone ringing]

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.583
[phone beeps]

01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:37.958
Best Quality Vacuum, how may I help you?

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:41.833
[Jesse]
<i>A deal's a deal? Your word is your bond?</i>

01:19:45.208 --> 01:19:46.208
It is.

01:19:47.708 --> 01:19:49.250
I'll get you your money.

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:18.375
[phone ringing]

01:20:23.333 --> 01:20:24.333
Hello?

01:20:25.292 --> 01:20:26.333
[Jesse] <i> Hey, Mom.</i>

01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:28.875
Jesse?

01:20:29.375 --> 01:20:30.542
It's Jesse.

01:20:32.167 --> 01:20:33.625
Give me... Give me the phone.

01:20:34.708 --> 01:20:36.167
Jesse, is that you?

01:20:36.917 --> 01:20:38.625
[Jesse] <i>Hey, Dad. Yeah, it's me.</i>

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.333
<i>How the both of you doing?</i>

01:20:42.125 --> 01:20:43.167
We've been better.

01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:44.833
Yeah.

01:20:45.833 --> 01:20:48.292
How's Jake? Can I say hi to him?

01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:50.915
[Adam] <i> Jake's on a band trip to London,</i>
<i>thank God...</i>

01:20:50.958 --> 01:20:52.750
[both] <i>Jesse, where are you?</i>

01:20:53.667 --> 01:20:56.458
I heard you saying
that I should turn myself in.

01:20:56.542 --> 01:20:59.250
[Diane] Yes. It's the right thing to do.

01:20:59.625 --> 01:21:01.667
[voice breaking]
Quit running and get some help.

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:03.542
[Adam] No one is trying to hurt you, son.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:07.750
Better you come forward on your own,
it'll be safer for you, better all around.

01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:10.708
[Jesse] <i>You remember where</i>
<i>we used to have those picnics?</i>

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:12.042
All those years ago?

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:14.708
By the little lake,
the one with all the ducks?

01:21:15.083 --> 01:21:16.083
[Adam] <i>Yeah?</i>

01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:22.167
Do you think you guys
could come get me maybe?

01:21:22.542 --> 01:21:23.792
[Diane sighs]

01:21:26.417 --> 01:21:28.042
- We're on our way.
<i>- </i> [Jesse] <i>Hey.</i>

01:21:28.292 --> 01:21:29.292
<i>And, uh...</i>

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.417
<i>it's probably too late to say this...</i>

01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:34.625
I don't know if it'll mean much to you...

01:21:39.042 --> 01:21:40.542
but you did your best.

01:21:42.167 --> 01:21:43.792
<i>And whatever happened with me...</i>

01:21:46.042 --> 01:21:47.125
<i>it's on me.</i>

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:48.375
<i>Okay?</i>

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:50.833
<i>Nobody else.</i>

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:56.625
[clicks, dial tone drones]

01:22:06.917 --> 01:22:08.458

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:11.208
[clatters]

01:22:36.458 --> 01:22:38.458
[engine revving]

01:22:47.833 --> 01:22:49.042
[tires screech]

01:22:54.042 --> 01:22:56.542
[indistinct police radio chatter]

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.667
[woman] <i>We're heading northbound on 12th,</i>
<i>about to turn left on Lomas.</i>

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:05.083
<i>- Be sure to stay on the house.</i>
- Will do.

01:24:17.292 --> 01:24:18.500
[faucet squeaks]

01:24:46.958 --> 01:24:49.042

01:24:57.292 --> 01:24:58.750
[sighs]

01:25:01.333 --> 01:25:02.708
Jake's birthday.

01:25:02.792 --> 01:25:04.000

01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:08.333
[door clanking]

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:12.042
[Neil] Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:12.958 --> 01:27:15.917
And then after that,
it's the first turn off Broadway.

01:27:18.542 --> 01:27:20.542
No, then you're gonna go ahead
and look for...

01:27:21.417 --> 01:27:23.125
Nah, man, don't go by junkyards.

01:27:23.208 --> 01:27:24.792
There's like 50 junkyards.

01:27:25.208 --> 01:27:26.542
The rebar place is what...

01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:28.708
Yeah, the re...

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:31.875
Yeah, exactly.

01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:34.333
That's the one.

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:35.583
Turn there.

01:27:36.625 --> 01:27:38.750
Yeah. Straight down on the right.

01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:39.917
Look for the sign.

01:27:43.292 --> 01:27:45.167
Oh, yeah, I got you.

01:27:57.458 --> 01:27:59.125
They're here!

01:27:59.625 --> 01:28:03.083
[men cheering, clapping]
Woo hoo! All right!

01:28:04.542 --> 01:28:06.625
[door opens]

01:28:07.542 --> 01:28:10.208
[man 1] Yeah, okay. Oh, my God.

01:28:12.417 --> 01:28:14.125
- Yeah.
- [men chuckling]

01:28:14.208 --> 01:28:15.083
[man 2] Woo!

01:28:15.167 --> 01:28:16.768
- [man] Keep your mouth shut.
- [man 2] All right.

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.018
- All right.
- [man 3] Oh, shit.

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:21.083
- Oh, shit.
- That's a big, big boy.

01:28:21.167 --> 01:28:23.083
This guy's bigger than your mom, Sean.

01:28:23.167 --> 01:28:24.625
- [all laughing]
- Who's Kandy?

01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:26.500
Yeah, that's me.

01:28:27.125 --> 01:28:30.500
- [Casey] The car's too small for you.
- $750 an hour, cash up front.

01:28:30.583 --> 01:28:32.458
- [man] Oh, man.
- The perks are extra.

01:28:32.542 --> 01:28:33.792
[Neil] Well, by all means.

01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:36.208
- I get the first perk.
- We want the perks.

01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:38.333
[man 1] Perks, perks! Yeah!

01:28:38.417 --> 01:28:40.917
- Don't we, boys? Yeah?
- We want the perks!

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.042
- Perks!
- [man 1] Got any perks in there?

01:28:43.417 --> 01:28:45.292
[man 2] Oh, my God!

01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:46.917
[man 3] That's what I'm talking about.

01:28:47.208 --> 01:28:49.625
- Gentlemen, hi.
- That's a good start. And hello to you.

01:28:49.708 --> 01:28:51.468
- [Neil] Hello to you.
- [man 3] Hi, welcome.

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.559
- [Casey] Where have you been all my life?
- [man 1] Excuse me.

01:28:53.583 --> 01:28:55.792
[stripper] Oh, just waiting for you
in this little car.

01:28:55.875 --> 01:28:59.075
- [Casey] Oh, I'm here, baby, don't worry.
- [man 1] Please, come right this way.

01:29:00.083 --> 01:29:01.833
[Casey] Careful, careful now.

01:29:01.917 --> 01:29:04.292
- Should've brought your work boots.
- [stripper chuckles]

01:29:04.417 --> 01:29:06.476
[stripper] Well, nobody told me
it was gonna be yucky.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.708
My name is Casey.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.333
[stripper] I never really go for redheads.

01:29:10.458 --> 01:29:12.042
[indistinct chatter]

01:29:23.125 --> 01:29:24.750
[crackling]

01:29:34.917 --> 01:29:35.917
All right.

01:29:36.625 --> 01:29:37.625
Done.

01:29:37.833 --> 01:29:39.208
Bullshit you're done.

01:29:39.292 --> 01:29:40.972
You've been here 20 minutes,
what'd you do?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.833
[Neil] Added a fishplate up here,

01:29:43.417 --> 01:29:45.167
one in the middle, one down at the end.

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:46.333
[Kenny] Added a what?

01:29:46.417 --> 01:29:47.417
[Neil] A fishplate.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.750
[Kenny] What, like a... plate of fish?

01:29:50.333 --> 01:29:52.101
What the fuck is that?
Is that even a real word?

01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:53.917
Look, man, I want more of those things,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.042
the sideway diagonal things,
like twice as many.

01:29:57.542 --> 01:29:58.583
Those are gussets.

01:29:59.833 --> 01:30:01.333
You got enough of 'em already.

01:30:02.042 --> 01:30:05.708
Okay, yeah. So, gussets I got out the ass,
but a fishplate I need 'cause... What?

01:30:05.792 --> 01:30:07.417
I'm Catholic and it's Friday?

01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:12.708
You sure you couldn't just
put a few more gussets up there, Neil?

01:30:13.083 --> 01:30:14.708
I mean, what could it hurt, right?

01:30:14.792 --> 01:30:16.167
Hey, it's your money.

01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:18.050
But what I just did,
you don't even need that.

01:30:18.333 --> 01:30:20.518
- I told you I built this thing right.
- [Kenny chuckles]

01:30:20.542 --> 01:30:24.333
Look, bro, I'm not like impugning
on your precious welding skills.

01:30:25.208 --> 01:30:28.708
It's just we have a, uh,
unique situation here.

01:30:28.792 --> 01:30:29.875
[clears throat]

01:30:32.417 --> 01:30:34.417
[chains rattle]

01:30:38.542 --> 01:30:40.375
Tried to rabbit on us once already.

01:30:41.792 --> 01:30:44.458
I'm thinking he's gonna figure out a way
to break this thing.

01:30:45.042 --> 01:30:46.042
You kidding me?

01:30:46.542 --> 01:30:47.542
Him?

01:30:47.667 --> 01:30:50.958
Yeah, it's just I kinda feel it flexing
a little bit. A bit right here, look.

01:30:51.417 --> 01:30:54.042
- [clanging]
- [grunting]

01:30:54.292 --> 01:30:56.542
Yeah, see? Right there.
Yeah, a little bit.

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:59.292
[Neil]
Yeah, I don't see jack shit flexing.

01:30:59.667 --> 01:31:01.542
That's four-inch channel iron up there.

01:31:01.625 --> 01:31:03.125
You could hang an F150 from it

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:05.792
and shove it back and forth
like a beach ball.

01:31:05.875 --> 01:31:06.875
It's going nowhere.

01:31:06.958 --> 01:31:10.917
Okay, you and your big four inches.
It's just this little bastard's wiry.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I don't care how wiry he is.
Have him knock himself out.

01:31:16.458 --> 01:31:17.458
Oh, yeah?

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.667
Wanna put your money
where your mouth is?

01:31:22.292 --> 01:31:25.000
Fifty bucks says he breaks this thing
right here, right now.

01:31:25.083 --> 01:31:26.417
Fifty, plus,

01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:30.708
then you gotta put up more of those...
What'd you call 'em, gussets?

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:31.833
No charge.

01:31:32.167 --> 01:31:34.208
Throw in some fishplates too,
while you're at it.

01:31:35.583 --> 01:31:36.792
[chuckles] You're on.

01:31:36.875 --> 01:31:37.958
- I'm on, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:31:38.042 --> 01:31:40.750
All right, all right.
Get that shit out the way and watch this.

01:31:41.375 --> 01:31:42.625
All right, good-lookin'.

01:31:42.875 --> 01:31:45.125
This is it. This is the acid test.

01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:46.875
Go for it.

01:31:48.917 --> 01:31:51.625

All right, all right.

01:31:57.625 --> 01:32:00.500
Hey, what are you slowing down for?
Hit it!

01:32:02.792 --> 01:32:04.101
[Kenny] All right, come on, get up.

01:32:04.125 --> 01:32:06.792
I got 50 bucks riding on you.
I gotta eat this month.

01:32:06.875 --> 01:32:10.375
Kenny, if he breaks his leg,
he's not gonna be able to cook.

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:13.625
What, are you the fucking HR department?
Jesus, Toddie, relax.

01:32:14.458 --> 01:32:16.542
We're gonna even up the odds a little bit.

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:19.250
All right.

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:20.708
Okay.

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:23.083
Now, I believe in you.

01:32:23.333 --> 01:32:25.417
You're gonna John Henry this bitch, yeah?

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:26.500
Now go.

01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:28.375

All right, other way. Faster!
Hit it hard!

01:32:37.042 --> 01:32:38.250
Yeah, baby!

01:32:38.375 --> 01:32:40.208
Yeah! Caught some air.

01:32:43.292 --> 01:32:45.417
Yeah! [laughing]

01:32:45.875 --> 01:32:47.333
Todd, who is this guy anyway?

01:32:47.917 --> 01:32:48.917
What'd he do?

01:32:49.583 --> 01:32:50.583
Uh...

01:32:50.667 --> 01:32:53.625
- It's... It's kind of a long story.
- [Jesse grunting]

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Yeah.

01:32:55.292 --> 01:32:56.375

Come on, we all will.

Where you going? Huh?

01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:46.583
- Come on.
- [Casey] Wanda!

01:33:48.333 --> 01:33:51.583
Hey, Wanda!

01:33:51.875 --> 01:33:55.083

Just wanna go home, get in my bed,

01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:18.833
[stripper 3] I am exhausted.

01:34:18.917 --> 01:34:21.277
[stripper 2] I'm never coming back
to this dump place again.

- [stripper 3] My feet hurt.
- [snoring]

01:34:25.042 --> 01:34:27.042
Wake up, Clarence, let's go.

01:34:27.583 --> 01:34:30.583
Look at my fucking shoes. I know.
This is a mess.

01:34:30.667 --> 01:34:32.667
- It wasn't even worth it.
- [engine starts]

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:35.125

to get the mud out.

cocaine wasn't even invented

It's okay, you can have some."

Come on, come to papa. There we go.

01:36:04.042 --> 01:36:05.208
I need more money.

01:36:06.375 --> 01:36:07.375
Oh, yeah?

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.500
That three-way split
didn't quite cover it for me.

I'd appreciate you helping me out.

01:36:15.042 --> 01:36:17.667
Well, what's he talking about?
Three-way split?

01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:20.000
You mean there was a third more?

01:36:20.083 --> 01:36:21.250
And you gave it to him?

It's a long story.

01:36:24.833 --> 01:36:25.917
Well... [scoffs]

What long story?

01:36:27.333 --> 01:36:29.833
When I left,
he didn't even have a fucking gun.

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:31.625
Well, he's got one now, doesn't he?

01:36:32.208 --> 01:36:34.750
So, you know, shut up. Let me handle this.

01:36:36.625 --> 01:36:38.958
Yeah, I can't believe you just
let him walk in here with...

01:36:39.042 --> 01:36:40.958
"Shut up" means everybody.

01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:46.333
Now,

01:36:46.792 --> 01:36:49.750
how exactly do you plan
on pulling this off?

01:36:50.667 --> 01:36:53.375
I mean, being that there's five of us
and one of you.

01:36:55.542 --> 01:36:57.292
I'm not here to rob you.

[Neil] Oh, you're not?

01:37:00.458 --> 01:37:01.667
Then how's this work?

01:37:04.375 --> 01:37:05.833
All I need is $1,800.

01:37:06.875 --> 01:37:08.208
I'm asking as a...

01:37:08.875 --> 01:37:09.875
a favor.

01:37:10.083 --> 01:37:11.583
Oh, what, like charity?

01:37:11.667 --> 01:37:15.292
Seems to me this silly son of a bitch
already forked over, big time.

01:37:15.375 --> 01:37:17.250
Casey, seriously, shut up.

01:37:18.625 --> 01:37:20.250
$1,800, huh?

01:37:21.458 --> 01:37:23.167
Why not an even two grand?

01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:24.875
You know, nice round number.

01:37:24.958 --> 01:37:26.375
$1,800 is all I need.

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:30.167
So, what's the gun for?
It's like personal protection?

01:37:31.458 --> 01:37:33.458

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.542
What is that? Let me see that thing.
Show me.

01:37:39.917 --> 01:37:43.000
Oh, my God, is that a .22?

01:37:43.833 --> 01:37:45.583

this piece of shit one more dollar...

01:43:27.375 --> 01:43:29.375
[exhales]

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:42.917
[Jesse] <i>Of course I miss you.</i>

01:43:46.125 --> 01:43:48.500
Yeah? Well...

01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:50.750
do you miss me?

01:43:55.375 --> 01:43:56.375
I don't know.

01:43:57.792 --> 01:44:00.250
How you...
How are you gonna convince me?

01:44:13.792 --> 01:44:15.792
[lock clicks, door opens]

01:44:51.083 --> 01:44:53.083
[indistinct chatter]

01:45:02.042 --> 01:45:03.583
Yeah, bitch.

01:45:04.542 --> 01:45:06.875
[coughing]

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.667
- Ah.
- Thank you.

01:45:19.417 --> 01:45:20.750
Leave the pitcher, would ya?

01:45:21.167 --> 01:45:23.375
- Sorry, can't really do that.
- W... wait.

01:45:28.083 --> 01:45:29.083
Sure you can.

01:45:34.833 --> 01:45:35.917
Wow.

01:45:36.333 --> 01:45:39.167
- It's like I'm here with Sinatra.
- I know, right?

01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:40.750
[chuckles]

01:45:42.042 --> 01:45:44.083
Certainly went big with the pineapple.

01:45:44.417 --> 01:45:46.458
[Jesse]
Only an asshole doesn't like pineapple.

01:45:47.250 --> 01:45:48.375
Guessing you don't?

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:50.583
[Walter] I can take it or leave it.

01:45:51.417 --> 01:45:53.875
Pineapple's good for you.
It's got bromide.

01:45:53.958 --> 01:45:55.042
Bromelain.

01:45:55.625 --> 01:45:56.833
But, close.

01:45:58.208 --> 01:46:00.042
Actually, it's not close at all.

01:46:00.208 --> 01:46:02.292
Are you gonna eat?
You should really eat something.

01:46:02.375 --> 01:46:03.875
No, I'm eating. I'll eat.

01:46:03.958 --> 01:46:05.458
Gotta eat, gotta hydrate.

01:46:05.542 --> 01:46:07.542
Get those electrolytes
you were talking about.

01:46:07.625 --> 01:46:09.833
- Your sodium, you know, all that shit.
- Good, yeah.

01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:12.750
Yeah.

01:46:12.917 --> 01:46:14.917
[coughing]

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000
[Jesse] Hey.

01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:23.042
- He's all right.
- [Walter] I'm fine, thank you.

01:46:23.542 --> 01:46:24.958
- You all right?
- I'm fine. Good.

01:46:25.042 --> 01:46:26.167
- Sit down.
- All right.

01:46:42.542 --> 01:46:44.625
How long will it take to sell this batch?

01:46:47.833 --> 01:46:49.250
- Six months.
- [Walter] Jeez...

01:46:49.333 --> 01:46:50.458
Easy. Maybe more.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.542
There's no one that you can think of
who might...

01:46:53.958 --> 01:46:55.125
buy the entire amount?

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:58.667
Uh, someone with a spare $1.3 million
lying around? No.

01:46:59.208 --> 01:47:00.500
Can't say that I do.

01:47:06.042 --> 01:47:10.292
Your family is gonna get every dime
they got coming to them, Mr. White.

01:47:11.292 --> 01:47:12.917
No matter how long it takes.

01:47:19.583 --> 01:47:21.917
- Hydrate. Seriously.
- Yeah.

01:47:30.875 --> 01:47:32.917
[Walter] What about you, Jesse? Hm?

01:47:33.708 --> 01:47:36.208
- [Jesse] Huh?
- After this. What then?

01:47:37.333 --> 01:47:38.458
[Jesse grunts]

01:47:39.292 --> 01:47:41.333
Nothing? What about college?

01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:42.833
[laughs]

01:47:42.958 --> 01:47:46.458
No, what is stopping you
from going to college?

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Um...

01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:51.500
- Nothing, I guess.
- Yeah, nothing at all.

01:47:52.250 --> 01:47:54.958
- Say you went to college.
- [Jesse] Uh-huh...

01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:57.667
What would you study, you think, eh?

01:47:58.208 --> 01:47:59.208
What interests you?

01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:03.417
Sports Medicine?

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.167
Sports Medicine.

01:48:06.583 --> 01:48:07.583
Yeah.

01:48:08.667 --> 01:48:11.000
That's... Yeah, sure. That's...

01:48:11.583 --> 01:48:12.875
- [Jesse] Yeah.
- ...could...

01:48:13.625 --> 01:48:16.417
Or... Business. Hm?

01:48:16.625 --> 01:48:18.083
Business and Marketing.

01:48:19.083 --> 01:48:21.667
You could practically teach that class.

01:48:21.917 --> 01:48:24.375
- Well, yeah.
- I mean, you'd be a natural.

01:48:25.708 --> 01:48:29.375
And with a Business degree,
I mean, that's handy anywhere.

01:48:30.792 --> 01:48:31.792
[Jesse] Yeah.

01:48:32.125 --> 01:48:34.625
- Yeah, I guess that could be cool.
- [Walter] Yeah.

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:36.000
You could do it too.

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:38.542
First step,

01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:41.750
get your GED, that's no problem.

01:48:42.708 --> 01:48:44.292
What do I need a GED for?

01:48:44.625 --> 01:48:45.750
I got my diploma.

01:48:47.792 --> 01:48:48.875
Oh.

01:48:49.583 --> 01:48:51.875
Of course, yeah, right.
Right, right, right.

01:48:51.958 --> 01:48:54.750
Yo, you were standing right on stage
when they handed it to me.

01:48:54.833 --> 01:48:56.500
I know, it just slipped my mind.

01:48:56.583 --> 01:48:59.500
I totally graduated high school, dick.

01:48:59.583 --> 01:49:02.268
- Which is no thanks to you, all right?
- Just stay on the subject here.

01:49:02.292 --> 01:49:03.292
All right?

01:49:03.375 --> 01:49:05.583
The larger point being...

01:49:08.583 --> 01:49:11.625
You know, look, forget it.
I... I don't have a larger point.

01:49:11.708 --> 01:49:14.125
- I'm just making conversation.
- [Jesse] Yeah.

01:49:18.333 --> 01:49:19.333
Hm.

01:49:22.458 --> 01:49:24.375
You're really lucky, you know that?

01:49:29.083 --> 01:49:32.292
You didn't have to wait your whole life
to do something special.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000

01:51:30.708 --> 01:51:32.083
This is Alaska.

01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:38.042
Forty miles in that direction
gets you to Haines.

01:51:41.458 --> 01:51:42.625
It's quiet.

01:51:44.167 --> 01:51:45.167
[Ed] Yeah.

01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:47.333
Figured you could use some of that.

01:51:54.167 --> 01:51:55.167
All right.

01:51:55.833 --> 01:51:56.833
Date of birth?

01:51:58.208 --> 01:51:59.625
[Jesse] 06/10/84.

01:52:00.125 --> 01:52:01.833
- Mother's maiden name.
- Stackhouse.

01:52:02.375 --> 01:52:03.500
Where was she born?

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:06.500
Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, Japan.

01:52:06.833 --> 01:52:08.000
Father's date of birth.

01:52:08.375 --> 01:52:10.000
02/07/51.

01:52:10.375 --> 01:52:12.917
Your father's second to the last job.

01:52:14.375 --> 01:52:17.958
Claims adjuster, Dairyland Insurance,
Appleton, Wisconsin.

01:52:18.042 --> 01:52:19.833
What's your social security number?

01:52:19.917 --> 01:52:22.958
[Jesse] 141-18-6941.

01:52:23.208 --> 01:52:24.208
Backward.

01:52:27.042 --> 01:52:31.792
1496-81-141.

01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:34.250
[Ed] All right.

01:52:35.083 --> 01:52:37.500
Daylight's burning,
you know where you're going.

01:52:37.625 --> 01:52:38.708
Anything else?

01:52:44.583 --> 01:52:45.875
Hold on a sec.

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:19.792
[sighs]

01:53:34.583 --> 01:53:35.875
Seal this up, please.

01:53:41.542 --> 01:53:43.667
I'm going to Mexico City in about a month.

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:45.750
I'll mail it from there.

01:53:46.833 --> 01:53:49.125
Anyone else you wanna say goodbye to?

01:53:51.708 --> 01:53:54.458
Not many of us
get a chance to start fresh.

01:53:55.917 --> 01:53:57.917
Good luck, Mr. Driscoll.

01:54:07.625 --> 01:54:09.750

01:54:50.833 --> 01:54:55.042
[Jesse] <i>I was thinking about that thing</i>
<i>you said about the universe.</i>

01:54:56.875 --> 01:54:58.875
Going where the universe takes you?

01:54:59.833 --> 01:55:00.875
Right on.

01:55:01.875 --> 01:55:03.667
I think it's a cool philosophy.

01:55:05.292 --> 01:55:08.000
I was being metaphorical.
It's a terrible philosophy.

01:55:12.917 --> 01:55:15.542
I've gone where the universe takes me
my whole life.

01:55:18.208 --> 01:55:20.625
It's better to make those decisions
for yourself.
