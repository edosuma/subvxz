Oh, come on. Sharon's gonna be back
in half an hour and I need a piss.

00:31.596 --> 00:35.012

Agh!
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

00:51.876 --> 00:53.732
Oh!

00:53.732 --> 00:57.036
Oh!
Why are you doing that noise?

00:57.036 --> 00:59.316
Oh, thank Jesus Christ!

00:59.316 --> 01:04.772
Oh, I dreamt I was drunk
and I couldn't get off the toilet.

01:04.772 --> 01:09.516
Are you sure it was a dream?
Sounds more like a memory.

01:09.516 --> 01:14.076
Er, what time is it?

01:14.076 --> 01:17.316
It's 3:15.
You should go back to sleep.

01:17.316 --> 01:19.836
Fergal gets in at some stupid hour.

01:19.836 --> 01:21.892
Jesus.

01:21.892 --> 01:24.036
What?

01:24.036 --> 01:26.556
I just don't know if
I can deal with him right now.

01:26.556 --> 01:29.436
And why are you having to plan
his birthday party?

01:29.436 --> 01:33.276
Plus, adults shouldn't HAVE
birthday parties.

01:33.276 --> 01:36.036
You sound like a supervillain.

01:36.036 --> 01:40.612
Good night.

01:40.612 --> 01:43.236
Can I play with your tits
a little bit?

01:43.236 --> 01:46.116
Do you mind if I go back to sleep?
No.

01:46.116 --> 01:52.116
Then go nuts.

01:52.116 --> 01:55.236
ROCK MUSIC PLAYS

01:55.236 --> 01:57.892
Huh.
What do you think?

01:57.892 --> 02:00.996
Well, my concern with Maroon Thrive
is that their set list includes

02:00.996 --> 02:03.652
both Shaggy and Enya, which is
impressive, but it's, like,

02:03.652 --> 02:06.052
"Where's your passion?"
It's grand for a bar mitzvah,

02:06.052 --> 02:09.156
but for a milestone birthday...
I say we keep looking.

02:09.156 --> 02:11.972
I'm not asking what you think of
them. I'm showing you who I booked.

02:11.972 --> 02:14.212
They're not that bad, are they?
No, they suck.

02:14.212 --> 02:17.252
They'd be perfect for your party.
Maybe we could get Mallandra

02:17.252 --> 02:20.556
to play her castanets along with
'em, jazz 'em up a little bit.

02:20.556 --> 02:23.076
Mallandra's not coming.
Why isn't she?She didn't want to.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.596
They threw a little ham party for me
        in Spain anyway.

02:25.596 --> 02:29.092
By the way, no ham at this party.
No. We can get pizzas delivered.

02:29.092 --> 02:32.676
What do you think? 9:00 PM?It
depends what time we cut the cake.

02:32.676 --> 02:35.556
You know what?
I would cut it after musical chairs

02:35.556 --> 02:38.692
but before the pinata.Just because
you're unhappy with your life

02:38.692 --> 02:40.956
doesn't mean I can't celebrate mine.

02:40.956 --> 02:43.116
What did Captain Piss Parade do
for his 40th?

02:43.116 --> 02:47.196
I can't remember what we... Weren't
you in Toronto for your 40th?

02:47.196 --> 02:50.692
No, I wasn't. I was supposed to be,
but I changed the trip

02:50.692 --> 02:53.316
to be here for my birthday.
But it is funny how,

02:53.316 --> 02:56.796
through the mists of time,
you've latched onto the Toronto myth

02:56.796 --> 02:59.076
to absolve yourself.
It was probably so last-minute,

02:59.076 --> 03:01.236
we didn't have time
to organise anything.

03:01.236 --> 03:04.772
I didn't need to go to the Ritz. We
could've gone to fuckin' Five Guys.

03:04.772 --> 03:08.132
I love Five Guys. Let's get
Five Guys instead.Unbelievable!

03:08.132 --> 03:11.012
Also we need to get some balloons.
Maybe black balloons?

03:11.012 --> 03:12.996
Black balloons?
I'm not turning seven.

03:12.996 --> 03:15.172
You know the sort of thing.
Masculine balloons.

03:15.172 --> 03:17.252
SHE SIGHS
Fine. Who else are we asking?

03:17.252 --> 03:19.356
Do you know Mum's coming over
for your birthday?

03:19.356 --> 03:21.636
Yeah, sure she is!
What do you mean?

03:21.636 --> 03:25.116
She's coming to see her new man.
SHE LAUGHS

03:25.116 --> 03:26.692
What the fuck?!

03:26.692 --> 03:28.836
And it's not even Fergal's fault.

03:28.836 --> 03:31.652
It's the fact that Sharon
not only tolerates him

03:31.652 --> 03:33.636
but enjoys him that drives me insane.

03:33.636 --> 03:36.156
Yeah. You said that at the meeting.
And, you know,

03:36.156 --> 03:38.556
this is the kind of time
when I would've drank,

03:38.556 --> 03:40.612
but I'm not gonna give him
that power, you know?

03:40.612 --> 03:43.596
It would be like giving a weasel
a machine gun.

03:43.596 --> 03:45.996
DAVE CHUCKLES
What's funny?

03:45.996 --> 03:50.076
Your biggest problem right now
is some asshole who lives in Spain.

03:50.076 --> 03:52.132
I wish I could worry about stuff
that small.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.396
What would YOU like me
to get upset about?

03:54.396 --> 03:58.116
Take your pick! There is
some bad shit coming down the line.

03:58.116 --> 04:02.556
I mean, we are not far away from
total societal collapse, my friend.

04:02.556 --> 04:07.116
Did you know London's water supply
could be compromised like that?

04:07.116 --> 04:10.852
Man, you need to get off
your basement computers.

04:10.852 --> 04:14.316
This isn't paranoia!
There are two points of entry -

04:14.316 --> 04:17.316
Croydon and Hampstead. You hit
both of those at the same time,

04:17.316 --> 04:20.316
you can expect four million
casualties in under an hour.

04:20.316 --> 04:23.796
Four million? Aren't there, like,
ten million people in London?

04:23.796 --> 04:25.836
That's not THAT bad.
Anyway,

04:25.836 --> 04:28.476
picked up our New Zealand passports
this morning,

04:28.476 --> 04:31.236
so we got a game plan.
What? How'd you get those?

04:31.236 --> 04:33.276
Dark web.

04:33.276 --> 04:36.396
I mean, it started out,
I just wanted to see if I could.

04:36.396 --> 04:38.796
I mean, they're not
a hundred percent legal,

04:38.796 --> 04:41.916
like in court, but for fathers
who care about their families,

04:41.916 --> 04:46.356
New Zealand really is
the only way to go.

04:46.356 --> 04:50.556
Want me to look into it for you?

04:50.556 --> 04:55.012
The flight was lovely, and Stephen
was waiting for me in arrivals

04:55.012 --> 04:58.052
with a home-made panini.
STEPHEN LAUGHS

04:58.052 --> 05:00.292
I... I have a panini press.

05:00.292 --> 05:02.796
Oh... Who are you?

05:02.796 --> 05:05.092
I mean, how'd you meet -

05:05.092 --> 05:09.276
Well, Stephen was on a shoot
in Mullingar.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.916
Stephen's a model,
if that's not obvious.

05:11.916 --> 05:14.372
You're a model?
Well, technically.

05:14.372 --> 05:17.092
It's all very new.
I was an accountant for 40 years.

05:17.092 --> 05:20.316
Stephen was scouted
in Gatwick Airport

05:20.316 --> 05:23.196
on his way back from Ayia Napa.
SHE LAUGHS

05:23.196 --> 05:25.732
Wow! That's...
I didn't know that...that...

05:25.732 --> 05:29.316
that people even... I just thought
young models grew into old models.

05:29.316 --> 05:32.316
You know, after a while
you stop doing swimsuit stuff

05:32.316 --> 05:35.492
and you start advertising
hot-water bottles.

05:35.492 --> 05:37.596
HE CHUCKLES
No. I, er...

05:37.596 --> 05:40.836
I do swimsuit work.
Rob was nearly a model once.

05:40.836 --> 05:44.196
I wasn't.He was.
People say that I, um...

05:44.196 --> 05:47.556
Does anyone want a drink?
Yeah.No.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.372
DOOR BANGS
Hello!Oh, it's Fergal.

05:50.372 --> 05:52.356
Hello, son!

05:52.356 --> 05:53.796
Mwah!

05:53.796 --> 05:57.412
This is Stephen.
Stephen, this is my son, Fergal.

05:57.412 --> 06:05.796
Hi.
Come here, you!

06:05.796 --> 06:07.972
Did you see the way she laughed
at his jokes?

06:07.972 --> 06:11.676
It was obscene.
Who uses their tongue to laugh?

06:11.676 --> 06:14.916
What WAS that?
Do you think they're having sex?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.916
I dunno. Maybe. She still has
her original hips, right?

06:17.916 --> 06:21.156
Oh, God!
I don't know how I feel about that.

06:21.156 --> 06:24.452
I mean, we barely have sex anymore,
and that's fine,

06:24.452 --> 06:27.396
but not if my mum's
gonna be doing it more than me.

06:27.396 --> 06:30.532
Maybe this is a wake-up call. Shall
we start making more of an effort?

06:30.532 --> 06:35.332
I don't know. I mean, here's how
I feel about sex with you these days.

06:35.332 --> 06:37.892
On paper, it sounds amazing.

06:37.892 --> 06:41.916
But if you were to initiate it,
like, tonight, I'd just be angry.

06:41.916 --> 06:44.796
SHE SIGHS
But I still have the fond feeling

06:44.796 --> 06:47.676
when I look at you.
Maybe that's enough.

06:47.676 --> 06:56.452
Goddammit, it IS enough!
   9 secs inc

06:56.452 --> 06:58.596
HE LAUGHS

06:58.596 --> 07:02.796
Your mum's boyfriend's
a feckin' ride. Good for her!

07:02.796 --> 07:06.276
No, not good for her! My dad died
six months ago. That's nothing.

07:06.276 --> 07:09.036
There's stuff in my fridge
that's more than six months old.

07:09.036 --> 07:11.196
How's it going, Rob?
Do you want a drink?

07:11.196 --> 07:14.796
No, thanks. I have alcoholism.Even
on your brother-in-law's birthday?

07:14.796 --> 07:18.756
Yeah, even then!That's why
AA would never work for me.

07:18.756 --> 07:20.676
It's, like, "Be reasonable."

07:20.676 --> 07:23.436
I told Anna to get here for 7:30.
Is that OK?

07:23.436 --> 07:26.316
I thought you and me could get there
  early, blow up the balloons.

07:26.316 --> 07:30.036
I can help with balloons. In college
I taught myself how to tie them off

07:30.036 --> 07:33.412
with my tongue.
Also, I've no gag reflex.

07:33.412 --> 07:35.556
That's...unrelated.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.476
You all right, Ciaran?

07:37.476 --> 07:39.996
Are we meeting the other
St Joseph lads in the pub?

07:39.996 --> 07:43.012
No, no. I think it's just me. A lot
of those lads don't like Fergal,

07:43.012 --> 07:45.396
so they didn't really know why
you invited them.

07:45.396 --> 07:48.876
Why don't they like him?
Oh, some fuckin' timeshare bollocks

07:48.876 --> 07:50.916
in Montenegro
that he roped them into,

07:50.916 --> 07:57.516
that went tits-up the second
their cheques cleared.

07:57.516 --> 08:03.156
You look lovely, Fergal!

08:03.156 --> 08:07.356
Do you have eyeliner on?
No!

08:07.356 --> 08:17.572
Just a bit of lip gloss.

08:17.572 --> 08:20.796
Come on.
Honey, I have sad news.

08:20.796 --> 08:23.796
I have diarrhoea.
And it's pretty bad,

08:23.796 --> 08:26.676
so I don't think
I can make the party. Sorry.

08:26.676 --> 08:30.052
Bullshit. You've diarrhoea?
I know when you've diarrhoea.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.796
The house smells like a poultry farm
  and you're covered in sweat.

08:32.796 --> 08:35.332
OK. I don't wanna come to
Fergal's party.

08:35.332 --> 08:37.596
What? You have to come!
I don't have to come.

08:37.596 --> 08:40.836
Look, just tell him I have diarrhoea,
and it hurts,

08:40.836 --> 08:43.596
and he won't care anyway.
Yeah. He might not care,

08:43.596 --> 08:46.596
but I'd really like you to be there.
     Come on. It'll be fun.

08:46.596 --> 08:50.796
Honey, look - my idea of fun isn't
pushing Fergal home in a wheelbarrow

08:50.796 --> 08:53.092
cos you're too drunk to do it.
OK, the Pope.

08:53.092 --> 08:56.676
Well, you know what? The wheelbarrow
thing sounds like brilliant fun,

08:56.676 --> 08:59.076
so maybe we've got
a bigger problem here.

08:59.076 --> 09:01.116
But it's good to know
that this is my future

09:01.116 --> 09:03.996
as the wife of a dry drunk. You used
 to stand in the corner scowling

09:03.996 --> 09:06.276
at parties.
Now you won't be there at all!

09:06.276 --> 09:09.756
Well, I hope you have
some hand cream in your bag
in case you have to jerk off any -

09:11.676 --> 09:14.436
That's just a funny joke
that we have.

09:14.436 --> 09:18.876
Um, so, listen, er, looks like
we won't need you tonight, Anna.

09:18.876 --> 09:22.236
So, I'm sorry -
What? Sorry if I cancelled plans,

09:22.236 --> 09:25.732
and I was gonna use the money to buy
my nephew Rocky a birthday present?

09:25.732 --> 09:29.732
So what I'll do is,
I'll just go read upstairs,

09:29.732 --> 09:34.836
and, um, it's great that you're here.

Hey! You having fun?
No.

09:51.756 --> 09:54.756
Maybe it wouldn't feel so pathetic
if you hadn't booked an actual barn

09:54.756 --> 09:58.116
for my party.
Was the O2 Arena not available?

09:58.116 --> 10:03.172
I'm sorry. I expected more people.
Oh, right! So it's my fault?

10:03.172 --> 10:06.212
This is not an honest representation
    of me as a people person.

10:06.212 --> 10:08.796
Do you wanna dance, Ciaran?
Sure.

10:08.796 --> 10:11.916
Let me drink...three more beers.

10:11.916 --> 10:13.956
You're on!
SHE LAUGHS

10:13.956 --> 10:17.572

   than your father's funeral.

Why don't you go to the party?

I don't like my brother-in-law.
Do you like Sharon?

10:46.784 --> 10:50.144
Yes, I like Sharon.
Just not enough to go to the party.

10:50.144 --> 10:52.184
How does that work, then?
What do you mean?

10:52.184 --> 10:54.840
Well, you don't like fun.
Sharon does.

10:54.840 --> 10:59.384
"Don't like fun"!
Ask Ricky Pratt if I like fun.

10:59.384 --> 11:02.040

11:45.240 --> 11:48.104
# We couldn't get closer than this

11:48.104 --> 11:52.184
# The way we walk,
the way we talk... #

11:52.184 --> 11:55.064
How are you? You OK?
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

11:55.064 --> 11:57.584
I mean, I'm lonely in my own home,

11:57.584 --> 12:00.944
but apart from that,
everything's great.

12:00.944 --> 12:05.560
Chris looks happy.
Everybody LOOKS happy.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.464
You don't.
Fran! Do you want another gin?

12:09.464 --> 12:11.864
Can I get you... Oh, no.
You look like you had enough.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.200
Er, hello!
So, Douglas,

12:14.200 --> 12:17.264
how did you get into
the whole plastic-surgery game?

12:17.264 --> 12:19.480
Did you go to med school
to become a real doctor,

12:19.480 --> 12:22.544
and then think, "You know what?
Any arsehole can save a life."

12:22.544 --> 12:26.040
"What I'd like to do
is give women weird, hard tits

12:26.040 --> 12:29.024
that start at their collarbones."
It's not all tits.

12:29.024 --> 12:31.320
Last year I reconstructed
an eight year old's face

12:31.320 --> 12:34.424
who'd been attacked
by a neighbour's dog.

12:34.424 --> 12:36.824
Oh, well, that...
I mean, that's different, that.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.344
But I also did an eye lift yesterday

12:39.344 --> 12:42.360
for a woman who had
a similar issue to yours.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.920
I'm not currently taking
new patients,

12:44.920 --> 12:48.224
but I'd be happy
to give you a referral.

12:48.224 --> 12:51.344
I don't have an issue!

12:51.344 --> 12:53.384
Do I?

12:53.384 --> 12:55.784
Where's Mark and Shane?

12:55.784 --> 12:58.784
Oh, they fucked off.Why?
I think they went bowling.

12:58.784 --> 13:02.264
Oh, for fuck's sake! Here,
let's get some of that new drug,

13:02.264 --> 13:05.144
the one that anaesthetists use.
The one that killed those people

13:05.144 --> 13:11.640
in Glasgow?Yeah, that one.
OK. I'll call my cousin.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.624
What?
Can you still get hard on those?

13:14.624 --> 13:20.504
HORNS BEEP

13:20.504 --> 13:23.624
Ma'am? Could you open the doors?

13:23.624 --> 13:27.824
The stop's just...there.

13:27.824 --> 13:30.584
We're an inch from the stop.
You couldn't even use feet

13:30.584 --> 13:34.304
to measure it.
HORNS BEEP

13:34.304 --> 13:37.424
Sir! Leave the doors alone, please!

13:37.424 --> 13:51.224
Thank you.

13:51.224 --> 14:01.664
BAND PLAYS ROCK MUSIC

14:01.664 --> 14:04.544
Check out the artist
formerly known as Douglas.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.224
SHE LAUGHS

14:06.224 --> 14:08.624
I didn't know you two
were back together.Och, aye.

14:08.624 --> 14:12.824
I'm only seeing him because of...

14:12.824 --> 14:19.304
Don't matter.
No. What were you gonna say?

14:19.304 --> 14:23.024
I messed up everything, didn't I?

14:23.024 --> 14:25.904
I screwed everything up! Sorry.

14:25.904 --> 14:28.304
I've had a couple of drinks.

14:28.304 --> 14:31.184
No, that's good, because I wanted -
Can you ask him to come back?

14:31.184 --> 14:33.240
What?Jeffrey.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.944
Can you tell him I'm sorry
and ask him to come back?

14:36.944 --> 14:40.304
Fran...
You've got that...lovely girl,

14:40.304 --> 14:44.920
and I've got...

14:44.920 --> 14:46.680
..nothing.

14:46.680 --> 14:51.584
SHE SOBS
MUSIC CONTINUES

14:51.584 --> 14:53.984
Going out with a male model.

14:53.984 --> 14:57.224
Our mother. It's not even funny.

14:57.224 --> 14:59.864
It's better than going out
with a DJ.

14:59.864 --> 15:03.224
Como te llamas?
Sofia.Should've known.

15:03.224 --> 15:09.240
HE CONTINUES IN SPANISH

15:09.240 --> 15:12.224
What if she's up for it? What are
you gonna do then, you clown?

15:12.224 --> 15:15.464
I dunno.

15:15.464 --> 15:18.704
Couldn't get any Fentanyl,
but I got this.What are they?

15:18.704 --> 15:22.680
They're blue.
Huh! Sweet!Yeah?

15:22.680 --> 15:24.760
Yeah? Would ya?
Come on, take us down.

15:24.760 --> 15:39.944
Come on, ya bollix!
Ow!Agh!

15:39.944 --> 15:43.960
HE GRUNTS

15:43.960 --> 15:55.960
Oh, my...God!
BELL RINGS

15:55.960 --> 15:59.160
# I need excitement,
oh, I need it bad

15:59.160 --> 16:02.264
# And it's the best I've ever had

16:02.264 --> 16:05.264
# I wanna hold her,
wanna hold her tight

16:05.264 --> 16:09.104
# Get teenage kicks
right through the night

16:09.104 --> 16:16.424
# All right...

16:16.424 --> 16:18.944
Hey!

16:18.944 --> 16:21.104
So, what's your angle?

16:21.104 --> 16:24.464
How do you mean?
You know she's still grieving,

16:24.464 --> 16:27.224
right? So anything she tells you
is just nonsense,

16:27.224 --> 16:30.224
like a fever dream.
There's no way she's over my dad.

16:30.224 --> 16:33.944
It would be strange if she were.
She's told me how hard
his death hit you all.

16:33.944 --> 16:38.744
Sounds like he was a wonderful man.
Yeah, well, he was.

16:38.744 --> 16:42.224
Nice to see you two chatting.
How are you getting on?

16:42.224 --> 16:44.280
Yeah, great. He's great.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.864
I think, you know,
if you two hit pause,

16:47.864 --> 16:50.024
and then picked it up again
in a couple of years

16:50.024 --> 16:52.120
when you've had proper time
to grieve for Dad,

16:52.120 --> 16:54.944
I might even feel good about it.
Here, can I have a Babycham?

16:54.944 --> 16:58.200
Argh!
What the hell?!

16:58.200 --> 17:02.504
What are you doing?
Fergal! What the fuck?!

17:02.504 --> 17:04.544
GIRL SCREAMS

17:04.544 --> 17:18.704

wanna hold her tight

17:21.584 --> 17:25.304
# Get teenage kicks

17:25.304 --> 17:31.784
# Hey #

17:31.784 --> 17:35.144
Hey, guys!

17:35.144 --> 17:37.184
We should maybe take a taxi.

17:37.184 --> 17:41.024
Why?
So we can get home quick and fuck.

17:41.024 --> 17:43.544
I'm ovulating.
HE CHUCKLES

17:43.544 --> 17:46.424
Right! Let's, er...

17:46.424 --> 17:53.984
What do you say we go somewhere
and...have a chat?

17:53.984 --> 17:56.144
Why am I even having to deal
with this anyway?

17:56.144 --> 17:59.024
Stop talking at me like that!
You're always moaning about -

17:59.024 --> 18:02.864
I'm not... Hey, you came!
Hey! Did you bring any diarrhoea?

18:02.864 --> 18:05.144
What the hell happened?
Does he have a pulse?

18:05.144 --> 18:07.184
Relax, Nancy.
He's just taking a breather.

18:07.184 --> 18:11.024
Oh, back off, Fergal!
What is your fucking problem?You!

18:11.024 --> 18:14.264
You think you're better than me?
Right now, yeah.Well, you're not.

18:14.264 --> 18:16.304
You're like a fuckin' fun-vacuum.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.520
You're like the Reverend
in Footloose.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.464
Everyone, stop dancing!
Stop having fun!

18:21.464 --> 18:23.744
The Reverend fuckin' Rob Norris
is here.

18:23.744 --> 18:26.744
Jesus Christ. Your eyes are a
hundred percent pupil. Are you high?

18:26.744 --> 18:30.224
It's my birthday!
Oh, Fergal! Nobody gives a shit.

18:30.224 --> 18:32.984
Six people showed up to celebrate,
and one of them's your mom.

18:32.984 --> 18:34.904
WOMEN SCREAM
The fuck...?

18:34.904 --> 18:37.184
ALL SHOUT AND SCREAM

18:37.184 --> 18:39.224
Just be careful!

18:39.224 --> 18:42.704
Fuck!Get off him!
SIREN APPROACHES

18:42.704 --> 18:44.744
PANDEMONIUM

18:44.744 --> 18:48.344
Fergal, what the fuck? Get off him!

18:48.344 --> 18:54.704
Um...who are we here for?

18:54.704 --> 18:58.200
PHONE PINGS

18:58.200 --> 19:02.680
Oh, come on!

19:02.680 --> 19:06.840
HE SIGHS

19:06.840 --> 19:09.464
What the fuck is going on with you?

19:09.464 --> 19:16.440
Are you having a mid-life crisis?
I'm not having a mid-life...

19:16.440 --> 19:19.480
My wife fucking hates me.
When I drive into work,

19:19.480 --> 19:21.704
I think about pulling into
oncoming traffic.

19:21.704 --> 19:25.304
Yeah, maybe it is a crisis.
Not mid-life, though. Come on!

19:25.304 --> 19:29.144
Jesus Christ! So,
what are you gonna do? Leave her,

19:29.144 --> 19:31.784
because you cannot continue
like this.

19:31.784 --> 19:34.064
You are gonna get yourself
in serious trouble

19:34.064 --> 19:36.224
being this much of an arsehole,
Fergal.

19:36.224 --> 19:38.984
You're gonna be in a bar one night,
mouthing off,

19:38.984 --> 19:43.904
and some Spanish Vinnie Jones
is gonna smash your face in.

19:43.904 --> 19:47.160
I can't leave her.What?
I fuckin' made a promise to Dad.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.784
I told him I'd work it out
with Mallandra.

19:49.784 --> 19:52.600
Why would you promise him that?
It made him smile.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.584
Fergal, he'd had a stroke.

19:54.584 --> 19:57.720
He didn't have full control
of his facial muscles.

19:57.720 --> 20:00.120
Oh!

20:00.120 --> 20:02.144
Morning.

20:02.144 --> 20:04.304
Morning.

20:04.304 --> 20:08.144
Where's Ciaran?Um...He slept
in Frankie's bunk bed last night.

20:08.144 --> 20:10.200
He's got a concussion, though,

20:10.200 --> 20:13.304
so I think it's important
that we let him sleep.What?

20:13.304 --> 20:15.344
No. That is the opposite
of what you do.

20:15.344 --> 20:19.424
I'll go check on him.

20:19.424 --> 20:23.984
Does anybody have a mint?

20:23.984 --> 20:30.224
It doesn't matter.

20:30.224 --> 20:33.704
I owe you probably 15 apologies.

20:33.704 --> 20:37.784
Look, it's OK. I had a bit of
a revelation earlier.

20:37.784 --> 20:40.664
I used the toilet after you were
in there this morning,

20:40.664 --> 20:43.544
and the seat was warm,
and I got really angry.

20:43.544 --> 20:46.544
But then I thought,
"Why do I care how it got warm?"

20:46.544 --> 20:50.384
It's warm and it's cosy.
What I'm trying to say is,

20:50.384 --> 20:54.344
you're my wife's brother, and...
I'm glad that you're leaving,

20:54.344 --> 21:01.424
but I know that you'll be back
at some point, and that's fine.

21:01.424 --> 21:04.664
Just out of curiosity,
have you ever hated anything
as much as you hate me?

21:04.664 --> 21:08.744
It seems a little excessive.

21:08.744 --> 21:11.504
Shar...
Sorry. Can just... Sorry. Can I go?

21:11.504 --> 21:14.864
Mum...
I'm sorry about how I behaved.

21:14.864 --> 21:17.144
You've just lost your husband.

21:17.144 --> 21:20.144
You should be able to do whatever
you wanna do when your husband dies,

21:20.144 --> 21:22.200
including fuck up. Which you're not.

21:22.200 --> 21:27.640
I guess I'm trying to say don't
break up with Stephen on my account.

21:27.640 --> 21:30.584
What were YOU gonna say?
I was just going to say,

21:30.584 --> 21:34.200
I left five euros for Frankie
under his pillow.

21:34.200 --> 21:38.864
Oh!

21:38.864 --> 21:41.264
Be careful, OK?

21:41.264 --> 21:44.504
That fit at that age,

21:44.504 --> 21:47.864
it just seems a bit... I'm just
saying he could be gay, you know?

21:47.864 --> 21:51.480
I mean, he's such a good dancer.
I don't want you to get hurt.

21:51.480 --> 22:02.200
Well, if he is gay,
he's under deep cover.

22:02.200 --> 22:05.864
How long would you wait to get
together with someone after I die?

22:05.864 --> 22:08.504
Like, if I had to go out
and look for 'em,

22:08.504 --> 22:10.664
it'd be, you know, a couple of years.

22:10.664 --> 22:15.160
But if somebody came up to me
and was, like, "I'm fucking you now,"

22:15.160 --> 22:18.584
then, I would wait, like, you know...
a day or two.

22:18.584 --> 22:20.984
SHE CHUCKLES
Yeah.

22:20.984 --> 22:24.104
If I die, I would be fine with you
being with someone else, you know?

22:24.104 --> 22:26.144
I'm dead. I don't care.

22:26.144 --> 22:29.080
But if the slut
you get together with

22:29.080 --> 22:32.864
even suggests my kids
call her "mum", I'll haunt her,

22:32.864 --> 22:35.864
and if Muireann has her period, you
come to my grave and you tell me,

22:35.864 --> 22:40.784
not your mail-order bride.
That's non-negotiable.

22:40.784 --> 22:44.144
Hey, I'm sorry I never threw you
a party for your 40th.

22:44.144 --> 22:47.384
I didn't want a party for my 40th.
Well, a picnic, then,

22:47.384 --> 22:49.544
or we could've gone to the beach.

22:49.544 --> 22:52.064
Just makes me wanna cry,
thinking about it.

22:52.064 --> 22:54.704
And I'm sorry about Fergal.

22:54.704 --> 22:57.824
I know sometimes it seems like
I put my family first,

22:57.824 --> 23:00.464
but I love you,
and that's why I married you,

23:00.464 --> 23:02.520
and not him.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.784
And also because I'm fun.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.064
Huh?Well, you still think I'm fun,
don't you?

23:07.064 --> 23:09.224
I know I said fun for me

23:09.224 --> 23:11.640
isn't rolling you and Fergal around
in a wheelbarrow,

23:11.640 --> 23:14.384
but, you know, I'd give it a shot.
SHE LAUGHS

23:14.384 --> 23:18.104
You are plenty of great things.
I don't need you to be fun.

23:18.104 --> 23:21.944
Well, tough luck, because I am.

23:21.944 --> 23:24.104
SHE LAUGHS
Get off!

23:24.104 --> 23:26.144
Stop!
GLASS BREAKS

23:26.144 --> 23:27.704
Ow!
Oh!

23:27.704 --> 23:30.224
Jesus!
I'm sorry!
