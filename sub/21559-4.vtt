Guide to Divorce"...</i>

00:02.898 --> 00:05.017
- Bald Eagle is Albert.
- Are you gonna keep seeing him?

00:05.027 --> 00:06.551
I don't know. There's something there.

00:06.561 --> 00:08.686
I mean, I'd be lying if
I said there wasn't.

00:08.696 --> 00:10.522
You were right, this is our thing.

00:10.532 --> 00:13.391
But if we decide to settle,
it'll be our decision.

00:13.401 --> 00:15.560
You do know that as long
as most of your money

00:15.570 --> 00:18.963
is tied up in this place,
you are not liquid.

00:18.973 --> 00:20.731
Stroke, not stake.

00:20.741 --> 00:22.400
My dad had a stroke.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.435
Hard to know exactly what the damage is.

00:24.445 --> 00:25.970
But there's going to be damage?

00:25.980 --> 00:27.872
<i>- Almost certainly.</i>
- I met someone.

00:27.882 --> 00:29.740
It's complicated.
I already broke up with him,

00:29.750 --> 00:31.142
but I still feel him, you know.

00:31.152 --> 00:32.442
I decided to move forward

00:32.453 --> 00:34.779
with our little bald friend.

00:34.789 --> 00:36.447
I gave you room to make
the right decision

00:36.457 --> 00:37.715
and you blew it.

00:37.725 --> 00:39.583
Wow! The truth comes out.

00:39.593 --> 00:42.153
Mom. Mom?

00:42.163 --> 00:45.156
My mom died. She had a heart attack.

00:45.166 --> 00:46.490
I mean...

00:46.500 --> 00:47.925
Miss McCarthy, it's your dad.

00:47.935 --> 00:51.236
- You're awake.
- Where's mom?

01:00.147 --> 01:02.907
I'm sorry, Rabbi,
but this list my mother made

01:02.917 --> 01:04.842
for her own funeral is so specific

01:04.852 --> 01:07.645
I mean, Blackberry Manischewitz.
Is that still even a thing?

01:07.655 --> 01:09.347
Oh, it is a thing.

01:09.357 --> 01:12.583
And it'll mess you up hard.
I am telling you.

01:12.593 --> 01:14.685
- Really?
- Thanks for the tip.

01:14.695 --> 01:16.520
- Why don't you sit down, Abby?
- I'm fine standing, thank you.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.956
Abby, this list should
not be a source of agita.

01:18.966 --> 01:20.758
That's not what your
mother would have wanted.

01:20.768 --> 01:22.593
Okay, yes, that is what
she would have wanted,

01:22.603 --> 01:24.495
but okay, I mean,
some of these things are like...

01:24.505 --> 01:26.297
They're not even possible.

01:26.307 --> 01:27.765
She wanted Jake to play "Let
it Shine" on the piano.

01:27.775 --> 01:29.633
I thought she hated Jake.

01:29.643 --> 01:32.870
So did I, but apparently,
she loved his piano playing.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.705
Or she thought it sucked

01:34.715 --> 01:36.040
and she just wants to
humiliate him one more time

01:36.050 --> 01:37.441
from beyond the grave.

01:37.451 --> 01:39.110
I'm gonna go with option "B."

01:39.120 --> 01:41.045
I think that's fantastic.
I love that idea.

01:41.055 --> 01:42.480
You know what? Jake can't
even come so, you know.

01:42.490 --> 01:44.181
By the way, by the way,

01:44.191 --> 01:46.684
this is an actual grocery
list for Zabar's.

01:46.694 --> 01:48.489
Zabar's delivers now.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.121
Across the country in 24 hours?

01:50.131 --> 01:51.322
The funeral's tomorrow.

01:51.332 --> 01:53.529
- Oh.
- Abby. Abby.

01:53.539 --> 01:56.060
You know what? Let's shake it out, okay?

01:56.070 --> 01:57.895
- I just want you to breathe...
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:57.905 --> 01:59.397
- And I want you to let it go.
- I'm gonna be fine.

01:59.407 --> 02:01.499
Please stop shaking me. Please.

02:01.509 --> 02:03.667
Okay. You know what?
We all hold on to what serves us.

02:03.677 --> 02:05.836
But, Abby, this list is important.

02:05.846 --> 02:07.671
Well, so is finishing my eulogy

02:07.681 --> 02:09.806
and so is picking my father
up from the hospital.

02:09.817 --> 02:11.409
Honoring the wishes of the departed,

02:11.419 --> 02:14.045
the Torah does not screw
around with that shit.

02:14.055 --> 02:15.713
But don't just give up.

02:15.723 --> 02:18.382
Don't let some writing
on a piece of paper

02:18.392 --> 02:21.585
dictate your emotions. Let it guide you.

02:21.595 --> 02:23.487
Let Dina guide you.

02:23.497 --> 02:25.322
Okay? You've got this.

02:25.332 --> 02:28.059
Okay, I'll try.

02:28.069 --> 02:29.360
I will do it.

02:29.370 --> 02:30.694
- There you go.
- Yeah.

02:30.704 --> 02:32.363
'Cause, Abby, you are a warrior.

02:32.373 --> 02:33.697
I'm a warrior.

02:33.707 --> 02:35.733
That list is your bitch.

02:35.743 --> 02:37.268
Where are you going?

02:37.278 --> 02:38.936
I have an appointment with my bathtub.

02:38.946 --> 02:41.205
It has been a beast
of a day, believe me,

02:41.215 --> 02:42.773
and I need to practice
a little self-care.

02:42.783 --> 02:44.442
But you've got your girlfriends here,

02:44.452 --> 02:46.577
and I will see you tomorrow.
Bye, everyone.

02:46.587 --> 02:47.966
- Bye, Rabbi.
- Bye, Rabbi.

02:47.976 --> 02:49.580
Bye. [SIGHS]

02:49.590 --> 02:52.616
Well, turns out death is stressful.

02:52.626 --> 02:53.984
We got this. The guests
have been invited.

02:53.994 --> 02:55.853
The coffin is picked.

02:55.863 --> 02:57.521
Babs has already ordered the
flowers for the reception.

02:57.531 --> 02:59.490
She's doing her part
from L.A. We're good.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.114
And what about the seating? Have we...

03:01.124 --> 03:02.760
Chairs are done. Boom.

03:02.770 --> 03:04.428
I'm concerned we're not gonna
get those chairs right.

03:04.438 --> 03:06.197
Does the Torah have any specifics

03:06.207 --> 03:07.465
on the particular plastic... [LAUGHTER]

03:07.475 --> 03:09.266
Or brand of folding chair?

03:09.276 --> 03:11.135
Yeah, I'm surprised my
mother didn't specify.

03:11.145 --> 03:13.804
She wants the exact chair that
she sat on at my bat mitzvah.

03:13.814 --> 03:15.639
Your mother's quite the character.

03:15.649 --> 03:18.075
Yeah, she was.

03:18.085 --> 03:19.944
Anyway, we need a piano player.

03:19.954 --> 03:22.746
Yes, we do. It would have
been nice if Jake were here.

03:22.756 --> 03:24.281
Yeah, it would have been helpful

03:24.291 --> 03:26.217
to have him here with the kids.

03:26.227 --> 03:28.119
But you know, he's filming
and whatever. It's a mess.

03:28.129 --> 03:29.553
Ow!

03:29.563 --> 03:30.721
Look, this thing is sweet!

03:30.731 --> 03:32.256
Oh, how retro.

03:32.266 --> 03:33.991
Yeah, it's Max's.

03:34.001 --> 03:35.960
Half this house is a
shrine to Max's childhood.

03:35.970 --> 03:39.263
Did you see all of the
baseball trophies in the den?

03:39.273 --> 03:40.498
Mm-hmm.

03:40.508 --> 03:43.067
This is a Slinky.

03:43.077 --> 03:45.236
This is what us kids played
with in the Paleolithic era.

03:45.246 --> 03:46.270
It was even before my time.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.571
What are you, Jurassic?

03:47.581 --> 03:49.140
Where's your sister, bun-bun?

03:49.150 --> 03:51.142
She's up in her room. She's really sad.

03:51.152 --> 03:52.776
Yeah, well, she misses grandma.

03:52.786 --> 03:54.856
Grandma's gonna be a ghost now, right?

03:54.866 --> 03:57.248
Mm, yeah. Absolutely.

03:57.258 --> 03:59.583
Does that mean she's
gonna come to our house

03:59.593 --> 04:01.619
- and haunt us?
- No.

04:01.629 --> 04:04.355
And if she did, it would be,
you know, like, not the scary kind.

04:04.365 --> 04:06.991
She'd probably just come back
to question our choices.

04:07.001 --> 04:08.459
Take this. Take that.

04:08.469 --> 04:10.225
Go away.

04:11.146 --> 04:13.008
Hello! Abby.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.166
You made it.

04:16.177 --> 04:17.801
You're here. Thank God.

- Hi.
- Hi.

04:19.947 --> 04:21.704
Oh.

04:23.317 --> 04:26.210
You're so scruffy and... and skinny.

04:26.220 --> 04:27.545
I'm sorry, Mom?

04:27.555 --> 04:29.146
Is my mom still here?

04:29.156 --> 04:30.803
All right, come say hi to your uncle.

04:30.813 --> 04:32.550
Uncle Max!

04:32.560 --> 04:35.553
Hey, Charles. You've gotten so big.

04:35.563 --> 04:37.388
- Uncle Max.
- Yeah?

04:37.398 --> 04:39.690
Mom says that grandma's
ghost is gonna come back

04:39.700 --> 04:41.559
and question our choices.

04:41.569 --> 04:43.727
That... that... that sounds
extremely accurate.

You look svelte.

If you got stuck in a
Berlin airport like I was...

04:53.147 --> 04:54.972
I couldn't get a flight out. I'm so...

04:54.982 --> 04:56.540
No, I get it. You're here now.
That's all that matters.

04:56.550 --> 04:58.409
I stopped off to see dad.

04:58.419 --> 04:59.910
Yeah.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.345
They're discharging him today.

05:01.355 --> 05:03.314
Yes, can you go get him actually?

05:03.324 --> 05:04.882
I have so much stuff, you know,
with funeral prep and...

05:04.892 --> 05:07.084
Oh, no, no. I was... I
was gonna take a nap.

05:07.094 --> 05:09.553
I'm pretty jet-lagged.

05:09.563 --> 05:11.488
- Yeah, yes, of course.
- Thank you.

05:11.498 --> 05:13.245
I will... I will get him.

05:13.255 --> 05:14.658
How'd he seem to you?

05:14.668 --> 05:16.894
- Out of it.
- Yeah.

05:16.904 --> 05:19.830
I'm not sure he's fully
grasping what's happened.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.865
Yeah, I know. It's hard
to see him like that.

05:21.875 --> 05:25.102
But the doctors say that he'll
recover most of his memories.

05:25.112 --> 05:27.200
So, you know, we'll see.

05:28.352 --> 05:32.042
Okay, photos for the service.

05:32.052 --> 05:33.510
Mom was very specific.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.112
- Well...
- Ladies, you all have the list.

05:35.122 --> 05:36.714
- Yes, we have the list.
- We got it.
