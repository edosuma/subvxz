00:00.102 --> 00:01.838
Previously on This Is Us...

00:01.853 --> 00:05.490
I'm not sure you've ever experienced
anything real your entire life.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.013
And that's our cue to leave.

00:07.048 --> 00:09.300
Our lead actress vanished a month ago,

00:09.310 --> 00:11.516
off the face of the planet.
You got involved with her.

00:11.516 --> 00:13.543
You slept with the
Tony-nominated star of my play

00:13.548 --> 00:15.254
- and ruined everything.
- Yeah, well, you know,

00:15.265 --> 00:17.080
I slept with you, too.
It didn't ruin anything.

00:17.088 --> 00:19.628
- Yeah, only ten years of therapy.
- Rebecca thinks that

00:20.116 --> 00:22.186
if we have kids, our
lives are gonna be over.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.126
- She's right, pal.
- I love our life.

00:25.176 --> 00:27.042
And I'm scared of changing it,

00:27.108 --> 00:29.405
'cause the truth is when I close my eyes

00:29.410 --> 00:31.512
and I think about our future...

00:33.790 --> 00:36.033
I see us with kids, Jack.

00:36.892 --> 00:38.600
- Yeah.
- William Hill,

00:38.631 --> 00:40.475
I loved you and you left.

00:40.535 --> 00:42.161
Now I'd like to spend whatever time

00:42.181 --> 00:43.528
you have remaining together.

00:44.008 --> 00:45.209
Would you?

00:45.329 --> 00:47.456
Dad, grandpa's gay,

00:47.827 --> 00:49.363
or at least bi.

00:49.654 --> 00:50.880
What's that now?

00:52.042 --> 00:55.009
The one thing I cannot live without

00:55.935 --> 00:57.316
is you.

01:04.846 --> 01:06.256
Where were you? Just say it.

01:06.261 --> 01:08.828
- I told you, it's none of your damn business!
- Dad! Dad!

01:09.497 --> 01:10.774
Leave her alone.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.120
Jack, it's okay. Go
back to your room now.

01:15.380 --> 01:16.773
No.

01:19.020 --> 01:20.686
This your big moment, Jack?

01:22.496 --> 01:24.158
You think you got it in you?

01:28.931 --> 01:30.869
Two of yous deserve one another.

01:42.290 --> 01:43.471
Mom.

01:48.605 --> 01:50.603
Promise me you'll never be like him.

01:52.957 --> 01:54.475
You promise me.

02:09.276 --> 02:10.949
Jack, I love it.

02:10.978 --> 02:13.350
We need a second bedroom
for the baby, right?

02:13.391 --> 02:16.033
Okay, crib can go right here.

02:16.153 --> 02:19.324
Or maybe it can go right there.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.405
Am I nesting right now?

02:20.411 --> 02:21.857
'Cause they told me
I would start nesting.

02:21.857 --> 02:23.207
Yeah.

02:24.432 --> 02:26.477
Can we even afford this place?

02:26.771 --> 02:29.755
Uh... Didn't that guy
say it was $200 a month?

02:29.775 --> 02:31.377
Look, I know that it's more expensive

02:31.401 --> 02:33.759
than their one bedrooms, but you like...

02:33.783 --> 02:35.957
- You like it, right?
- Yeah.

02:36.001 --> 02:37.454
Okay, that's good, because I already put

02:37.466 --> 02:38.988
first, last and security deposit.

02:39.023 --> 02:40.357
- What?
- Yeah.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.326
Jack!

02:42.526 --> 02:44.825
- Jack!
- Yeah, yeah. I already did it.

02:52.353 --> 02:54.251
So is, is this the moment?

02:54.295 --> 02:55.805
Is this, is this when we find out

02:55.833 --> 02:57.751
if we're... we're
having a boy or a girl?

03:03.101 --> 03:04.918
Wait, what's wrong, Dr. Schneider?

03:05.615 --> 03:07.753
What would you guys say if I told you

03:07.777 --> 03:09.485
you were having twins?

03:09.727 --> 03:11.472
Well, I...

03:11.474 --> 03:12.940
- I'd say you're lying.
- Yeah.

03:12.942 --> 03:13.891
Wha... ?

03:14.348 --> 03:16.097
- I am.
- Oh, okay.

03:19.208 --> 03:20.814
You're having triplets.

03:29.975 --> 03:32.979
Never fun telling a young couple
they're having three babies

03:33.055 --> 03:35.305
and not just the one
they were ready for.

03:35.522 --> 03:36.551
Yeah.

03:37.948 --> 03:39.310
Triplets.

03:40.139 --> 03:42.445
Always a headache with triplets.

03:42.949 --> 03:45.780
Just glad they're your
patients, not mine.

03:59.854 --> 04:01.671
- Coming through!
- Out of the way, coming through.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.033
Moving out.

04:03.049 --> 04:04.734
Watch your back.

04:08.548 --> 04:10.435
Let's go, we're losing him. Let's go!

04:11.736 --> 04:13.058
Out of the way!

04:16.428 --> 04:17.498
I'm sorry.

04:17.553 --> 04:19.495
Do you know where room 412 is?

04:19.755 --> 04:22.154
Oh, okay. I keep getting
turned around in here.

04:25.092 --> 04:27.443
This is what I get for
flying across the country

04:27.464 --> 04:28.991
to surprise you.

04:29.565 --> 04:32.189
- You're alive. Stop complaining.
- No, I'm tired.

04:32.379 --> 04:35.052
I am cranky. And I have a straw

04:35.077 --> 04:37.549
stuck so far up my junk
that I could whistle

04:37.574 --> 04:39.251
"Don't Worry Be Happy" if I sneezed.

04:39.276 --> 04:42.360
- What can I do to make you feel better?
- I need you

04:42.362 --> 04:44.799
to lock that door and climb up here.

04:45.089 --> 04:47.146
- Come on. Get up here, come on.
- No, I can't.

04:47.156 --> 04:50.429
- You just had a heart attack.
- No, I had arrhythmia.

04:50.464 --> 04:53.419
An arrhythmia doesn't
even sound serious.

04:53.463 --> 04:55.210
All right, it's harmless.
Like, "Hey, what...

04:55.230 --> 04:57.958
Hey, why is that white
guy such an awful dancer?"

04:57.960 --> 05:01.376
"Oh, don't mind him. He has arrhythmia."

05:02.427 --> 05:04.309
I'm not mounting you in a hospital.

05:04.350 --> 05:06.026
- Come on, please.
- Toby.

05:06.051 --> 05:07.847
At least do that thing
where you tickle my...

05:07.872 --> 05:11.733
Hey. I apologize, Nurse Ratchet.

05:11.774 --> 05:13.567
She's insatiable.

05:13.598 --> 05:15.281
She can't get enough.

05:15.306 --> 05:17.838
- It's... come on, give me a kiss.
- You're belligerent.

05:18.633 --> 05:20.366
All right. Oh, nice.

05:20.410 --> 05:21.604
Did I get something on you? I'm sorry.

05:21.650 --> 05:22.999
- No, a little something on me.
- No. No.

05:23.049 --> 05:24.219
- Give me a kiss.
- No!

05:24.257 --> 05:25.452
Give me an oatmeal kiss.

05:25.471 --> 05:26.840
You need to calm down.

05:26.884 --> 05:28.967
I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding.

05:29.023 --> 05:30.700
I've never done that before. I'm...

05:31.976 --> 05:33.495
Oh.

05:33.495 --> 05:34.962
- Good morning.
- Hi.

05:34.964 --> 05:36.137
Morning.

05:36.882 --> 05:38.358
It is a good morning, right?

05:38.364 --> 05:41.079
Early risers. You remember Sloane,

05:41.136 --> 05:42.970
the brilliant, genius playwright;

05:42.972 --> 05:45.339
- also the Jew who crashed Christmas.
- Ah.

05:45.341 --> 05:48.096
Thank you guys so much
for having me. This is...

05:48.151 --> 05:51.645
there is an Uber here,
he's outside, uh...

05:51.647 --> 05:53.395
- okay. Bye.
- Bye.

05:55.616 --> 05:58.099
Sweetheart. I know what you're thinking.

05:58.103 --> 06:00.420
You're thinking, "Kevin,
this is not a flophouse

06:00.433 --> 06:03.074
- that you use for your dates."
- Mm-hmm.

06:03.714 --> 06:05.658
Duly noted. It won't happen again.

06:05.778 --> 06:07.664
Okay? I want you to know that. Also,

06:07.699 --> 06:09.581
you're probably
thinking that me sleeping

06:09.582 --> 06:11.623
with the writer of a
play that I'm producing

06:11.653 --> 06:13.700
is probably going to end up
blowing up in my face, right?

06:13.702 --> 06:15.834
- Hmm, I'm on fire this morning.
- Mm-hmm.

06:15.837 --> 06:17.349
But we artists don't have, you know,

06:17.394 --> 06:19.000
normal professional relationships.

06:19.015 --> 06:20.357
We have what I like to call...

06:20.367 --> 06:21.473
Wait for it...

06:21.869 --> 06:23.205
"artnerships."

06:24.191 --> 06:25.442
Oh. Okay.

06:26.058 --> 06:27.714
You see what I did?
I took "partnership"...

06:27.716 --> 06:29.346
Without the "P". Yep, I followed it.

06:29.366 --> 06:31.468
- You follow it, William?
- I'm trying.

06:31.478 --> 06:32.629
- Mm-hmm.
- William,

06:32.749 --> 06:34.211
let's get you involved. How is the, uh,

06:34.223 --> 06:36.408
how is the sequel to Beginners going?

06:38.366 --> 06:41.053
It's a Christopher Plummer movie
that came out a few years ago

06:41.063 --> 06:43.681
about a guy late in life
who comes out of the closet.

06:45.117 --> 06:48.273
- I say that because you're gay now.
- I'm not gay now.

06:48.311 --> 06:50.983
I've always loved both women and men.

06:51.020 --> 06:52.706
And, you know, a lot of artists believe

06:52.728 --> 06:54.992
sexuality isn't fixed, as it is fluid.

06:54.994 --> 06:56.689
What's fluid?

06:56.737 --> 06:59.579
Oh, your bio-Daddy's only
half gay, it turns out.

06:59.916 --> 07:00.977
Hmm.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.467
Uh, dim sum. I was thinking about

07:03.508 --> 07:05.878
- getting dim sum.
- Oh, no, I won't be home tonight...

07:05.910 --> 07:06.943
I'm going out with Jessie.

07:06.951 --> 07:09.290
Yeah, he's going out with Jesse.
♪ Bow-chick-a-bow... ♪

07:09.300 --> 07:10.727
I could always reschedule.

07:10.751 --> 07:12.100
No, no, no. It's fine. It's all good.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.136
Uh, you and Jessie do your thing.

07:14.355 --> 07:16.096
No soup dumplings for you!

07:24.646 --> 07:27.713
This bedroom feels so much smaller now.

07:28.226 --> 07:30.360
I didn't want to nest for three.

07:31.649 --> 07:33.613
I only wanted to nest for one.

07:34.132 --> 07:35.918
- I know.
- How are three kids

07:35.942 --> 07:38.821
supposed to grow up in one bedroom? I...

07:39.313 --> 07:42.112
How are we even going to get strollers

07:42.348 --> 07:46.543
up and down the stairs
of a sixth-floor walkup?

07:48.933 --> 07:51.997
We have to get our
security deposit back.

07:52.616 --> 07:54.436
We can't. I tried.

07:54.595 --> 07:55.963
Well, I could ask.

07:56.019 --> 07:57.604
They were pretty firm about it.

07:57.676 --> 07:59.827
- I could cry.
- I did.

08:00.765 --> 08:01.923
Didn't work.

08:04.259 --> 08:07.047
Look, babe, look, let's
not overreact, okay?

08:07.086 --> 08:08.424
L... let's just figure this out.

08:08.454 --> 08:10.696
Of all days to be having
lunch with my mother.

08:10.703 --> 08:13.750
Wait until she hears that
we're living in a two-bedroom,

08:13.768 --> 08:15.730
sixth-floor walkup with triplets.

08:15.775 --> 08:17.645
The condescension and the judgment.

08:17.653 --> 08:18.944
- Oh!
- Oh, Bec, come on...

08:18.953 --> 08:20.756
I know, I know, I know.
She's not that bad.

08:20.803 --> 08:22.554
My passive-aggressive
mother's nothing compared

08:22.576 --> 08:25.633
to your abusive father...
I get it, Jack. Jesus.

08:29.985 --> 08:32.056
I am upset.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.316
And I'm hormonal.

08:35.328 --> 08:37.094
- I know.
- And I have...

08:37.214 --> 08:39.563
three human beings living inside of me.

08:39.565 --> 08:41.325
So I've heard.

08:42.476 --> 08:47.156
- You really tried crying?
- Oh, yeah. Just full waterworks...

08:47.458 --> 08:50.440
like a little boy.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.743
We're not getting the
security deposit back.

08:52.745 --> 08:54.449
But I'm gonna figure something out.

08:54.569 --> 08:56.413
Okay?

08:56.415 --> 08:59.861
- I will. I will figure something out.
- Right.

09:06.828 --> 09:08.208
Oh, hey.

09:08.328 --> 09:10.307
I would much rather you
get in this tub with me

09:10.312 --> 09:13.145
- than these magazines.
- Why am I so thrown by William and Jessie?

09:13.516 --> 09:15.366
- Oh, we're doing that instead, then?
- I mean,

09:15.384 --> 09:16.885
what the hell is wrong with me, Beth?

09:17.102 --> 09:19.546
- Am I homophobic?
- You are not homophobic.

09:19.555 --> 09:21.251
Well, how do you know?

09:21.439 --> 09:22.982
Because you're good,

09:23.025 --> 09:25.134
and you're open-minded, that's why.

09:25.526 --> 09:28.275
- Plus, your favorite coworker is gay.
- Keith's not gay.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.697
- Really?
- No, he's French Canadian.

09:31.049 --> 09:33.184
- It's confusing.
- Damn.

09:33.304 --> 09:34.932
All right, if I'm not homophobic,

09:34.959 --> 09:36.869
then why does it make me feel so weird

09:36.912 --> 09:39.338
every time William talks about Jessie.

09:39.380 --> 09:42.145
Because you thought you
were getting to know him.

09:42.167 --> 09:45.394
- And this, admittedly, is a curveball.
- It is.

09:45.470 --> 09:47.787
It's a big, gay curveball.

09:48.244 --> 09:49.836
You know, why don't you just...

09:49.956 --> 09:51.148
try to get to know Jessie...

09:51.159 --> 09:52.768
Maybe you'll feel better, you know?

09:52.789 --> 09:55.589
Next time he comes to pick up
William, actually talk to him.

09:55.709 --> 09:57.667
It'll give you good practice for when

09:57.716 --> 10:00.136
Tess and Annie start to
bring boyfriends home.

10:00.145 --> 10:01.384
I hate that sentence.

10:01.410 --> 10:03.519
- Or girlfriends.
- I prefer that.

10:03.556 --> 10:06.497
See? Not homophobic.

10:06.884 --> 10:10.418
Now, you want to know what
my sexual preference is?

10:10.429 --> 10:11.650
Hmm?

10:11.770 --> 10:14.957
For you to get your ass in this tub.

10:15.077 --> 10:17.576
I can't just turn it on like that, Beth.

10:17.588 --> 10:19.362
- Randall.
- Okay.

10:21.396 --> 10:23.165
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

10:24.194 --> 10:27.371
You have to take off a piece of
clothing if you lose the hand.

10:27.414 --> 10:30.185
- It's called strip poker for a reason.
- That doesn't seem fair.

10:30.207 --> 10:31.487
I didn't make up the rules.

10:31.514 --> 10:32.969
- Really?
- Hey, I only have one piece of clothing

10:32.971 --> 10:34.180
- to take off, so you'd be fine.
- Mm-hmm.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.270
Mm-hmm.

10:35.829 --> 10:37.849
- Hey.
- I see your applesauce,

10:37.887 --> 10:40.049
and I raise you a pudding.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.244
- I hate funny doctors.
- I know.

10:42.530 --> 10:45.182
Okay, Doc, it has been real.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.725
We've had some good times.
We've had some bad times.

10:47.936 --> 10:50.247
We even had that time you
stuck a tube up my junk.

10:50.269 --> 10:52.399
So how about you say you
get me out of this dump?

10:52.519 --> 10:54.314
I love this guy.

10:54.353 --> 10:55.915
But let's get serious for a minute.

10:55.924 --> 10:58.428
- Okay.
- Toby, after we installed the stint,

10:58.450 --> 10:59.676
we ran some tests.

10:59.706 --> 11:02.735
The arrhythmia was caused
by a minor septal defect,

11:02.743 --> 11:04.850
which means there's a very small hole

11:04.882 --> 11:06.706
between two of the heart's chambers.

11:06.925 --> 11:09.069
Now some people may choose, uh,

11:09.099 --> 11:11.728
not to repair the hole, and
treat it with medication.

11:11.745 --> 11:14.744
But I strongly suggest surgery.

11:17.175 --> 11:19.900
Let me explain to you
exactly what's going on.

11:20.209 --> 11:22.631
Although this is a more serious surgery,

11:22.631 --> 11:24.356
I've performed it many times.

11:24.627 --> 11:27.196
We go in and stabilize
you with diuretics,

11:27.316 --> 11:29.399
and then repair the septal defect.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.617
- Hey, nice wheels.
- Appreciate it.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.399
- Ever think about selling it?
- Every day. But not today, pal.

11:42.455 --> 11:44.229
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, Pearson.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.880
- Yeah. Uh...
- You needed to see me?

11:46.902 --> 11:49.376
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, uh,
fellas, two minutes.

11:49.436 --> 11:51.194
Give me two minutes,
Jimmy. Get out here.

11:51.314 --> 11:53.399
Come on, get a cup of coffee.

11:53.899 --> 11:55.765
So, kitchen sink,

11:55.819 --> 11:58.331
uh, cabinets are going
in after the weekend.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.686
It's coming together, though.

11:59.721 --> 12:01.590
- Shaping up really nice, don't you think?
- It's a pit.

12:01.601 --> 12:04.048
Everything that can go wrong
with this place goes wrong.

12:04.064 --> 12:05.764
This hellhole's gonna bankrupt me.

12:05.769 --> 12:07.727
What do you need?

12:07.942 --> 12:09.345
Probably bad timing.

12:09.383 --> 12:11.609
Pearson, you called, I came. What's up?

12:11.889 --> 12:13.099
Uh...

12:13.820 --> 12:15.783
Wife and I found out
we're having triplets.

12:15.815 --> 12:17.401
Ooh. I'm sorry.

12:17.417 --> 12:20.871
- No, no, no. I... it's an exciting thing.
- For who?

12:21.392 --> 12:23.297
Look. Anyhow, I, uh...

12:23.417 --> 12:24.782
I need a raise.

12:25.814 --> 12:29.182
I'm a hard worker. I've
done good work for you.

12:29.209 --> 12:31.877
I've always... I've always...
I've never let you down.

12:31.904 --> 12:33.399
You know, it's just,
with triplets, uh...

12:33.464 --> 12:36.976
Okay. I'll bump you to 17k a year.

12:38.676 --> 12:41.610
- I need more.
- It's a ten percent raise.

12:41.627 --> 12:44.305
You're already my highest-paid
foreman. Don't push.

12:44.353 --> 12:47.822
And finish this hellhole
so I can sell it.

12:47.942 --> 12:49.305
Yeah.

12:49.789 --> 12:52.506
- I'm sorry about the triplets.
- Yeah.

12:59.626 --> 13:01.159
Please.

13:04.485 --> 13:06.504
Please, just stay a little bit longer.

13:07.688 --> 13:09.269
No.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.082
My time is up.

13:12.442 --> 13:14.184
I'll see you sooner than later.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.917
Blackout. End of play.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.450
And lights up.

13:26.016 --> 13:28.641
Well? Anyone gonna... you know.

13:29.436 --> 13:30.728
Nothing.

13:30.975 --> 13:32.121
Ron?

13:32.557 --> 13:34.036
Was it that bad?

13:36.612 --> 13:39.753
I have to say, when Olivia disappeared,

13:39.796 --> 13:43.565
and Kevin decided to
self-finance this play,

13:43.571 --> 13:45.324
opposite the girl who wrote it,

13:46.674 --> 13:49.454
I said to myself, "Ron, old boy,

13:50.029 --> 13:53.208
you've won three Tony
Awards, and here you are,

13:53.218 --> 13:57.886
directing a failed sitcom
actor's vanity project."

13:58.085 --> 13:59.424
Oh...

14:06.179 --> 14:08.706
But there... But there's more?

14:11.293 --> 14:13.138
- Or is... there's more.
- Oh, good.

14:13.654 --> 14:16.064
But now, I have to admit...

14:17.839 --> 14:19.592
... you two are great together.

14:20.534 --> 14:22.787
You're honest, you're, you're raw.

14:23.045 --> 14:24.981
I think you two can pull this off.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.625
Yeah.

14:26.745 --> 14:29.542
Okay, everybody. Take
15. We'll do act one

14:29.546 --> 14:30.829
when we come back.

14:31.714 --> 14:33.237
We're real. Get over here.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.546
God, that felt good.

14:34.606 --> 14:36.151
It's raw, it's intense.

14:36.577 --> 14:38.165
Not to mention... Hello?

14:38.187 --> 14:39.624
Did you see this, Sloane?

14:39.899 --> 14:41.194
Yeah.

14:41.230 --> 14:42.729
I freaking love that poster.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.279
Since when do I have cheekbones?

14:44.304 --> 14:46.404
Come on. Let's go get a coffee.

14:46.430 --> 14:47.862
Come on. Come on.

14:49.575 --> 14:51.666
- Kevin, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

14:51.847 --> 14:53.456
I... Even though every feminist bone

14:53.464 --> 14:55.168
in my body will stop talking to me...

14:55.198 --> 14:56.558
What's up?

14:56.850 --> 14:58.857
What are we doing? Like,

14:58.878 --> 15:01.809
do we like each other? Are
we just sleeping together?

15:01.836 --> 15:03.457
Because if we're just
sleeping together, that's...

15:03.497 --> 15:05.634
that's totally fine. I...

15:05.675 --> 15:07.396
I mean, 'cause I can't,
like, totally process

15:07.416 --> 15:09.735
- that someone like you would sleep
- Whoa,

15:09.782 --> 15:11.060
- with me, so...
- what does that even mean?

15:11.073 --> 15:12.728
I don't understand what that
means. Listen, here's the thing.

15:12.741 --> 15:14.758
I like you. Okay?

15:14.878 --> 15:17.151
A lot. I like sleeping with you.

15:17.185 --> 15:19.510
I... I like the fact
that you're, you're funny,

15:19.531 --> 15:21.289
and you're brilliant,

15:21.291 --> 15:22.706
even though you're from Long Island.

15:22.717 --> 15:24.459
What's wrong with
being from Long Island?

15:25.001 --> 15:27.453
I don't know. It's just, I've
heard other New Yorkers slam it,

15:27.480 --> 15:29.663
so I wanted to try to fit
in. The point is I don't know

15:30.013 --> 15:32.116
what we are. Okay? That's the truth.

15:32.137 --> 15:33.669
I don't know what I think we are.

15:33.670 --> 15:35.928
I just know that I like
the fact that there's a "we"

15:36.223 --> 15:38.432
- for us to talk about.
- Me, too.

15:39.567 --> 15:42.066
Well, don't you two look cute together?

15:43.335 --> 15:45.104
I'm back.

15:52.608 --> 15:54.803
Oh, my God, Olivia. Uh...

15:55.109 --> 15:56.581
The hell are you doing here?

15:56.847 --> 15:58.220
And what have you done with your hair?

15:58.298 --> 16:01.017
I made a physical change

16:01.030 --> 16:03.435
- to match the spiritual one.
- Uh-huh.

16:03.478 --> 16:06.077
Look, you said a lot
of things to me, Kevin.

16:06.115 --> 16:07.953
I mean, you told me I was cruel. But

16:08.116 --> 16:10.690
worse than cruel... inauthentic.

16:11.150 --> 16:12.467
But you were right.

16:12.665 --> 16:16.037
So I went away for a while to
try to find some authenticity.

16:16.157 --> 16:18.177
And I did it, okay? I found it.

16:18.455 --> 16:22.096
I did ayahuasca with a shaman
in the Salt Flats of Utah.

16:22.134 --> 16:24.930
I howled at the moon with
the prairie coyotes of Kansas.

16:24.941 --> 16:28.055
I fished with the lobstermen of Maine.

16:29.217 --> 16:31.830
I mean, you did all that in a month?

16:31.895 --> 16:34.288
But, look, I'm back now,
and I am better than ever.

16:34.288 --> 16:35.713
For the play,

16:36.563 --> 16:37.935
and for you.

16:38.055 --> 16:40.593
- Um...
- I want us to be together.

16:40.598 --> 16:42.196
Okay? I've changed.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.670
I'm, I'm ready for something real.

16:46.768 --> 16:49.554
Sorry, Olivia, but...

16:49.823 --> 16:51.618
we're dating now.

16:51.995 --> 16:54.395
Life goes on after you disappear.

16:54.415 --> 16:56.889
- Yeah.
- Olivia?

16:56.923 --> 16:58.995
- Ron.
- Oh, my God.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.400
Oh, my God.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.895
Thank God.

17:05.061 --> 17:07.036
- We were dead without you.
- Oh...

17:08.701 --> 17:10.914
Well, how soon can you operate?

17:10.919 --> 17:13.753
Well, we can get him in tomorrow
morning, if you're willing.

17:13.756 --> 17:15.489
Look, I can get you into my schedule,

17:15.491 --> 17:17.833
- but you've got to commit now.
- Wow.

17:18.349 --> 17:20.259
Speed Racer, over here.

17:20.738 --> 17:22.702
It's, uh, it's okay, Doc.

17:22.704 --> 17:24.287
- I think I'll pass.
- No.

17:24.289 --> 17:26.234
It's not okay. And we
need to talk about this.

17:26.257 --> 17:28.601
Uh, we... There's nothing
to talk about, all right?

17:28.626 --> 17:30.684
He said medication was an option, so.

17:31.470 --> 17:32.928
Toby.

17:33.048 --> 17:35.321
- I'll leave you two alone.
- Yeah.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.437
Um... This is serious.

17:41.557 --> 17:44.390
- And this could kill you.
- Yeah. And so could surgery.

17:44.510 --> 17:46.609
- Uh...
- Okay. You're being a child.

17:47.061 --> 17:50.357
Oh, wow. A child? Okay. All right.

17:50.477 --> 17:51.929
Okay.

17:51.989 --> 17:55.521
What? Oh. Oh, okay. All
right. Where you going?

17:55.704 --> 17:57.861
Um... I don't know.

17:57.925 --> 18:00.406
I don't feel like yelling at man
with a heart condition right now.

18:00.408 --> 18:01.786
It's an arrhythmia.

18:02.093 --> 18:04.160
It's a condition.

18:04.162 --> 18:06.963
And you are an idiot if you
don't think about repairing it.

18:06.965 --> 18:08.562
Said gently and carefully,

18:08.566 --> 18:10.020
to the man who has a heart condition

18:10.025 --> 18:11.816
that can surgically be treated.

18:13.328 --> 18:15.638
God...

18:17.593 --> 18:21.241
- A mistake to start a family?
- This is such a bad idea.

18:21.278 --> 18:22.935
Uh, but we'll figure everything out.

18:22.956 --> 18:24.053
- It's just, it's...
- Hello.

18:24.173 --> 18:26.164
- Hi. What can I get you?
- Uh, Caesar salad,

18:26.191 --> 18:28.968
no dressing, no anchovies.

18:28.981 --> 18:30.932
Uh, Chardonnay, your driest one,

18:30.952 --> 18:32.760
and an ashtray.

18:33.506 --> 18:34.892
And for you, miss?

18:34.892 --> 18:36.794
- Um, I'll have...
- Oh, she'll have the same.

18:37.197 --> 18:39.691
Uh, but no wine. Just a Coke.

18:39.738 --> 18:41.392
Diet Coke.

18:43.166 --> 18:44.754
Thank you.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.442
Mom, c... can you not smoke

18:51.469 --> 18:53.075
- the cigarettes at the table, please?
- Oh!

18:53.079 --> 18:55.836
Rebecca, stop believing
every single thing you read.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.465
It's fine.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.262
- Can you put it out, please?
- Okay. Okay.

18:59.279 --> 19:00.526
Thank you.

19:00.957 --> 19:03.033
So, Jack does it again.

19:03.619 --> 19:06.067
The man can't even get
you pregnant responsibly.

19:06.094 --> 19:09.164
- Stop it.
- A handyman with triplets.

19:09.228 --> 19:11.450
- Just perfect.
- He's not a handyman.

19:11.457 --> 19:13.320
He's a construction foreman.

19:13.385 --> 19:18.152
- And he does very well for himself.
- Not well enough. Not for this.

19:21.407 --> 19:24.491
He cannot support three children.

19:24.493 --> 19:26.658
And you can't raise three children

19:26.662 --> 19:30.278
- in a two bedroom walk-up.
- Mother, I'm not gonna sit here

19:30.284 --> 19:31.790
- and listen to you.
- What? No.

19:31.811 --> 19:33.930
- I'm not. I'm gonna leave.
- Yeah. You don't have to, because

19:33.983 --> 19:35.835
you know it already.

19:36.726 --> 19:38.372
What are you gonna do?

19:41.794 --> 19:43.186
I don't know.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.565
Well, it's okay.

19:50.636 --> 19:52.453
Because I do.

19:55.291 --> 19:57.709
Jessie! Come in.

19:57.726 --> 19:58.823
Randall.

19:58.894 --> 20:00.071
Good to see you.

20:00.191 --> 20:03.353
- William! Jessie's here.
- I'll be down in a minute.

20:03.364 --> 20:06.388
- He'll be down in a minute.
- Yes.

20:06.508 --> 20:08.749
Uh, well, come on in, Jessie.

20:08.788 --> 20:10.868
- We can get to know each other a little.
- Okay, uh...

20:10.895 --> 20:12.197
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Sure.

20:12.223 --> 20:14.325
You know, I've got this
great Japanese whiskey

20:14.870 --> 20:17.571
that you would definitely
not be interested in

20:17.580 --> 20:20.497
on account of being an addict,
or you'd be too interested.

20:20.499 --> 20:22.082
Either way, you can't have it.

20:22.084 --> 20:23.521
I rescind my offer.

20:23.569 --> 20:24.802
I'm fine, thank you.

20:24.804 --> 20:25.943
- Have a seat, please.
- Oh.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.370
- Just there?
- Sure. It's, uh...

20:31.394 --> 20:33.731
Ooh. Nice.

20:35.014 --> 20:36.222
That's...

20:44.813 --> 20:46.457
- So, um...
- Yeah.

20:46.826 --> 20:48.243
Uh, where did you and William meet?

20:48.269 --> 20:49.744
- Tinder.
- Tinder.

20:49.800 --> 20:50.894
- Wow.
- Yeah.

20:50.915 --> 20:53.252
Surprised William
even know anything a...

20:54.461 --> 20:56.096
- You're kidding.
- I am.

20:56.401 --> 20:58.556
We met at our meeting.

20:58.578 --> 21:00.419
Yes.

21:00.441 --> 21:01.886
You're very funny.

21:01.968 --> 21:03.662
I can see why my father likes you.

21:03.710 --> 21:04.992
- Mm.
- Sexiest thing about a man

21:05.014 --> 21:06.558
is his sense of humor.

21:08.180 --> 21:09.596
Would it be okay

21:09.598 --> 21:11.131
if I had some of that Japanese whiskey?

21:11.152 --> 21:12.761
- Will you mind? No?
- Hey.

21:13.799 --> 21:15.322
Oh, well...

21:15.343 --> 21:17.486
very nice chatting with you, Randall.

21:17.507 --> 21:19.169
Thanks, Jess... ie.

21:19.737 --> 21:20.968
Jessie.

21:22.473 --> 21:24.207
Randall, I'll be staying
at Jessie's tonight.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.262
Wow, staying over? Okay.

21:27.292 --> 21:29.490
Um, you got your chemo meds?

21:29.508 --> 21:30.974
I can bring it down
for you, if you like.

21:30.991 --> 21:32.678
I'm fine, Randall. I
have everything I need.

21:34.717 --> 21:36.728
- Are you coming back tomorrow?
- Probably.

21:36.757 --> 21:38.424
We'll, we'll play it by ear.

21:38.716 --> 21:40.162
- See you later.
- All right.

21:40.184 --> 21:43.217
Very cool. I'll see you, see you...

21:45.848 --> 21:47.988
- Toby.
- Oh. Hey, hey, hey.

21:47.988 --> 21:50.942
- What's with the text?
- Uh, I'm gonna do it.

21:51.231 --> 21:52.697
Do what?

21:52.817 --> 21:55.489
The surgery, in an hour. I
wanted you to be informed,

21:55.502 --> 21:58.057
but, uh, I didn't want you to freak out.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.639
O... okay. Is that why
you texted me in all caps,

22:00.693 --> 22:03.873
"Get back here ASAP, 911! Crying face"?

22:03.887 --> 22:05.824
Yeah. The original
version of that text had,

22:05.857 --> 22:08.418
like, ten more crying faces.
I'm a little stressed out.

22:08.479 --> 22:10.267
Well, why didn't we talk this through?

22:10.294 --> 22:13.084
Because I... I... I didn't want
to because I had to do it now

22:13.124 --> 22:15.907
or else I was gonna
chicken out. And, uh, God,

22:15.918 --> 22:17.885
I hate Dr. Singh, I'll
tell you that much.

22:17.886 --> 22:19.371
- Name?
- Uh, Toby Damon.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.985
- Place of birth?
- Palm Springs.

22:21.012 --> 22:24.320
I hate surgery. I hate the word
surgery. I hate, I hate surgeons.

22:24.336 --> 22:25.798
I hate sturgeon, the fish,

22:25.829 --> 22:28.335
'cause it sounds like
"surgeons." God, I'm freaking out.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.051
- Just breathe, babe.
- Yeah.

22:30.088 --> 22:31.443
- Okay?
- Yeah.

22:31.658 --> 22:34.619
I just don't want you
to freak out, okay?

22:34.621 --> 22:36.719
Well, don't worry about me freaking out.

22:36.745 --> 22:38.494
Uh, well, I do have to
worry about it, Kate,

22:38.526 --> 22:41.303
because the thing is, is that
I'm kind of in love with you...

22:42.858 --> 22:44.336
is the thing.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.337
There, you happy?

22:47.359 --> 22:49.735
You got a dying man to
confess his love for you.

22:49.794 --> 22:51.624
You are are not dying.

22:51.651 --> 22:53.205
Okay. What is that?

22:53.264 --> 22:55.136
Holy cow, look at the
size of that thing.

22:55.152 --> 22:56.894
I am a big guy, but jeez.

22:56.910 --> 22:58.610
Look this way. We're getting
ready to take you to prep.

22:58.647 --> 23:00.702
Okay. What is in that?

23:00.745 --> 23:03.289
- It's fine, don't worry about it.
- Okay, come here, give me a kiss.

23:06.404 --> 23:07.910
- Ah.
- Okay.

23:07.974 --> 23:09.028
Ah.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.173
- Watch your back.
- All right.

23:10.184 --> 23:12.320
- Oh, my God. We're going so fast.
- Bye, babe.

23:12.374 --> 23:15.228
- What was in that needle?
- Just medicine.

23:18.857 --> 23:21.513
And he told me that he loves
me and I didn't say it back.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.261
Why didn't I say it back?

23:23.381 --> 23:25.732
A great guy finally
tells me that he loves me,

23:25.758 --> 23:27.281
and I couldn't say it back
because I didn't want it to be

23:27.307 --> 23:28.916
this big dramatic good-bye.

23:28.951 --> 23:31.037
What if something happens
to him when he's in surgery?

23:31.157 --> 23:33.008
Listen, Kate, hey, he's gonna be fine.

23:33.034 --> 23:34.497
I don't want to talk
about it anymore, okay?

23:34.532 --> 23:37.048
- I brought you guys here to distract me.
- Okay.

23:37.237 --> 23:38.713
And you both are doing a terrible job.

23:38.726 --> 23:40.421
- I'm sorry.
- Someone,

23:40.541 --> 23:42.025
say an anecdote, uh, s... some...

23:42.047 --> 23:43.842
- Do something.
- Yeah, no. Okay, uh... So, um,

23:43.962 --> 23:46.950
oh, Cindy from Accounting says
that she's gluten-free, right?

23:47.070 --> 23:49.142
But then yesterday she
brings these muffins in

23:49.181 --> 23:50.777
- that are clearly not...
- Uh, no. Kevin, you're up.

23:51.492 --> 23:54.263
Um, Olivia is... is back.

23:54.646 --> 23:56.728
Oh, okay. Better. Please proceed.

23:56.896 --> 23:58.729
- Yeah? So, Olivia's back,
- Yeah.

23:58.768 --> 24:00.966
and, uh, she wants to get back
together with me, of course,

24:01.005 --> 24:03.035
and, uh, she wants to star in the play,

24:03.195 --> 24:05.329
but the only thing is, I'm
with Sloane now, you know,

24:05.350 --> 24:07.329
and Sloane's starring in the
play. So, all of this is happening

24:07.372 --> 24:08.968
while I'm producing the
play, acting in the play.

24:08.976 --> 24:11.058
I'm trying to secure all
this publicity for the play,

24:11.217 --> 24:13.240
and I'm trying to be taken
seriously for the first time

24:13.261 --> 24:15.012
- in my entire adult life, so...
- Hmm.

24:15.404 --> 24:17.425
Whoa. What are you gonna do?

24:19.244 --> 24:20.289
I don't know.

24:20.595 --> 24:23.430
I... I don't... I mean, they're
both really great in the play.

24:23.886 --> 24:25.401
You know, Olivia is more famous,

24:25.414 --> 24:27.135
but she also might be mentally ill.

24:27.255 --> 24:28.572
True.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.744
I feel like they're both
sexy, though, you know.

24:30.864 --> 24:32.435
I mean, in different
kinds of ways. Right?

24:32.452 --> 24:34.298
So, like, Sloane I see as like...

24:34.320 --> 24:37.194
- like hot, librarian sexy. Right?
- Oh.

24:37.237 --> 24:38.807
- Uh-huh.
- Whereas, Olivia's more like, you know,

24:38.824 --> 24:40.751
like, uh, intense artist kind of sexy,

24:40.780 --> 24:42.098
- which is different.
- Mm-hmm.

24:42.132 --> 24:44.271
But she's also British, which makes her

24:44.283 --> 24:46.005
hot librarian sexy, as well,

24:46.035 --> 24:47.946
- Oh, my God, man. Are you kidding me?
- kind of by default...

24:47.972 --> 24:49.546
- This is...
- What?

24:49.623 --> 24:51.843
Two beautiful women
wanting to be with you,

24:51.868 --> 24:53.104
- that's not a problem.
- Yeah.

24:53.134 --> 24:54.257
You want to know a problem?

24:54.308 --> 24:56.343
A problem is your
dying biological father

24:56.360 --> 24:57.526
suddenly turning gay.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.933
- Well, hmm.
- That's...

24:58.981 --> 25:00.646
- Why is that a problem?
- I don't know.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.090
We are a hot mess, huh?

25:03.436 --> 25:05.534
- Yeah.
- Big Three?

25:05.594 --> 25:07.322
Big Three.

25:14.650 --> 25:16.397
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.611
Mm. How are you, babe?

25:19.627 --> 25:21.520
I'm good. I'm good. How are you?

25:21.542 --> 25:23.957
I'm okay, thank you. What are you doing?

25:24.077 --> 25:26.269
Doing stuff.

25:26.877 --> 25:31.127
Hey, did you know that if
you squint your eyes real hard

25:31.131 --> 25:32.944
and look at this bank statement,

25:32.949 --> 25:35.854
you could actually see some extra zeros?

25:35.875 --> 25:38.346
Hey, how was lunch with your mom?

25:38.466 --> 25:40.195
Uh...

25:41.082 --> 25:43.084
- judgmental.
- Mm-hmm.

25:43.204 --> 25:44.773
Yeah.

25:48.988 --> 25:50.564
But she, um...

25:52.844 --> 25:55.985
... she did have kind
of an interesting idea.

25:56.522 --> 25:58.077
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

25:58.814 --> 26:02.396
She suggested that maybe once

26:02.516 --> 26:04.364
- we have the kids,
- Mm-hmm.

26:04.429 --> 26:06.080
We move in with them.

26:08.086 --> 26:10.731
'Cause they have all that space, and,

26:10.785 --> 26:12.388
you know, we could save money,

26:12.431 --> 26:14.603
live with them for a year or two.

26:16.292 --> 26:18.357
Hey-o.

26:21.428 --> 26:23.130
Oh, oh, you're serious.

26:24.618 --> 26:27.538
Um, uh...

26:28.770 --> 26:32.840
babe, you... your
mother drives you nuts.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.233
You sure you want her
standing over your shoulder

26:35.249 --> 26:37.194
every minute with three babies?

26:37.201 --> 26:38.707
I think it could be nice...

26:39.821 --> 26:41.482
to have family around, you know.

26:45.243 --> 26:49.407
Who are you? And what
have you done with my wife?

26:49.527 --> 26:51.875
Jack, I'm serious.

26:51.995 --> 26:53.610
She does mean well.

26:53.859 --> 26:55.304
Yeah.

26:55.424 --> 26:57.374
And I think it could be...

26:58.699 --> 27:00.623
good for us. So I want to try

27:00.623 --> 27:02.507
and keep an open mind about it, okay?

27:02.627 --> 27:03.690
Okay.

27:05.561 --> 27:08.522
Yeah. You know, now that I think
about it, there is one thing

27:08.535 --> 27:10.652
you could do for the babies, right now.

27:10.665 --> 27:12.364
- Babe, I'm gonna find three cribs.
- I need a gallon

27:12.377 --> 27:13.883
of mint chocolate chip ice cream.

27:13.952 --> 27:16.335
There she is.

27:16.561 --> 27:18.268
- Yeah.
- There's my wife.

27:18.287 --> 27:19.485
There I am.

27:19.524 --> 27:20.825
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:20.885 --> 27:22.084
- Go.
- I'll be right back.

27:22.105 --> 27:23.945
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

28:03.471 --> 28:05.455
Babe, I... I forgot my wallet.

28:05.492 --> 28:06.853
Oh.

28:06.880 --> 28:11.446
Um, did you, um, did you
check the coffee table?

28:11.457 --> 28:13.969
Yeah, it was... it was on the dresser.

28:14.089 --> 28:16.609
Good. Okay, I'm glad you found it.

28:17.464 --> 28:21.013
Um, just a gallon of mint
chocolate chip, please.

28:21.051 --> 28:22.589
Yeah, I'm on it.

28:25.655 --> 28:27.274
Thank you.

28:28.118 --> 28:29.452
I'll be right back.

29:41.345 --> 29:42.918
Hey, Dad.

29:44.618 --> 29:46.729
What the hell do you want?

29:53.008 --> 29:55.167
I need to borrow some money.

30:00.806 --> 30:03.093
Um, okay, so, you know, I mean,

30:03.126 --> 30:06.065
I've given this a lot of
thought, obviously. And I, um...

30:06.770 --> 30:08.310
Um...

30:09.661 --> 30:11.557
I'm keeping Sloane in the play,

30:11.570 --> 30:13.506
because she's worked
really hard, you know,

30:13.555 --> 30:15.383
and she's good in the play, she's great.

30:15.426 --> 30:17.496
And, uh, she didn't abandon us.

30:17.702 --> 30:20.683
You know, I trust her, so I'm,
I'm keeping her in the play.

30:22.824 --> 30:24.529
I understand.

30:27.050 --> 30:28.995
What about us?

30:36.650 --> 30:39.305
Yeah. I'm gonna continue
to date Sloane, because

30:39.307 --> 30:41.597
she's kind and she's sweet, she's funny.

30:41.604 --> 30:43.917
She likes me, you know?

30:45.120 --> 30:47.600
And... and... and you know what?

30:47.649 --> 30:49.185
Sometimes you just got
to do the right thing.

30:49.241 --> 30:50.644
Okay? You got to do the right thing,

30:50.721 --> 30:52.403
even if it's not what you want.

30:56.839 --> 30:58.672
Well...

30:59.709 --> 31:01.852
Surprise final act.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.484
Best of luck.

31:11.378 --> 31:13.882
Now I am gonna go and
have incredible sex

31:13.886 --> 31:16.800
with a complete stranger
and forget I ever met you.

31:18.891 --> 31:20.685
So harsh.

31:26.768 --> 31:27.926
Hey.

31:29.441 --> 31:30.843
I tell you what, that was intense.

31:30.856 --> 31:32.629
Not a lot of fun. Um...

31:34.634 --> 31:36.129
I feel like I need a drink.

31:36.131 --> 31:37.448
Do you want to... you
want to go somewhere,

31:37.482 --> 31:38.613
have a drink with me?

31:38.733 --> 31:39.983
Somewhere?

31:40.219 --> 31:42.039
You know, I'm, uh...

31:43.786 --> 31:46.338
I'm just gonna lay low tonight.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.554
It's a big rehearsal tomorrow.

31:49.626 --> 31:51.247
It's the right thing to do.

31:55.344 --> 31:56.781
Sloane...

32:04.753 --> 32:06.215
Hey, Tobe.

32:06.723 --> 32:08.414
They said it went perfectly and

32:09.068 --> 32:11.567
that you're gonna be awake soon.

32:14.794 --> 32:16.296
So...

32:17.014 --> 32:18.636
I love you, too.

32:19.686 --> 32:21.265
Just an FYI.

32:21.825 --> 32:24.943
Um... Oh. I've never said that

32:25.442 --> 32:28.114
to anyone I wasn't related to.

32:31.119 --> 32:33.036
Listen, this is scary.

32:33.492 --> 32:35.333
This is all just...

32:36.040 --> 32:37.782
scary, honestly.

32:41.379 --> 32:44.947
But I want to spend the rest
of my life with you, Toby.

32:45.519 --> 32:48.191
I mean, if you'll... if you'll have me.

32:56.129 --> 32:57.536
That would've been a lot hotter

32:57.566 --> 33:00.582
if you were in some kind of,
like, sexy nurse's outfit.

33:00.763 --> 33:02.045
W...

33:02.286 --> 33:04.067
Uh, how long have you been awake?

33:04.488 --> 33:06.041
About an hour.

33:06.287 --> 33:08.077
- What?
- Uh... Sorry.

33:09.242 --> 33:10.744
- Yeah.
- Toby.

33:11.054 --> 33:12.831
Did you mean all that stuff?

33:13.696 --> 33:15.328
Yeah.

33:15.688 --> 33:19.318
I would totally marry you if
that's something you're down with.

33:20.130 --> 33:21.722
You would?

33:21.792 --> 33:24.455
I'd marry the hell out
of you, Kate Pearson.

33:26.596 --> 33:28.876
You would?

33:28.893 --> 33:31.286
- Wait, just like that?
- Just like that.

33:33.034 --> 33:36.024
It was just like that from
the moment I met you, kid.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.139
All of this is just...

33:41.397 --> 33:43.511
life trying to get in the way.

33:43.631 --> 33:46.001
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:57.499 --> 33:59.021
You're back.

34:01.709 --> 34:03.140
I am.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.174
Do you think we've bonded?

34:10.158 --> 34:11.614
Since you moved in.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.922
I kind of thought we had.

34:15.460 --> 34:16.966
Sure.

34:18.128 --> 34:20.871
Then why is it so easy for
you to push me to the side?

34:21.521 --> 34:24.230
Me, Beth, the girls.

34:24.969 --> 34:27.572
Ever since Jessie came
back into your life,

34:27.598 --> 34:30.353
it's like you don't care
about spending time with us.

34:30.648 --> 34:33.295
And I'm not trying to act like
some kind of jealous teenager,

34:33.304 --> 34:35.817
- nor deny you your love life, be...
- Stop.

34:41.893 --> 34:45.551
And don't give me some
damn story about your cat.

34:51.842 --> 34:53.940
I can feel it now, Randall.

34:55.679 --> 34:58.769
This cancer is coming
for me sooner than later.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.706
I can feel it.

35:03.137 --> 35:05.201
Now, Jessie can handle it.

35:06.207 --> 35:08.455
He's seen this stuff.

35:09.027 --> 35:11.455
He's been helping me make arrangements,

35:11.575 --> 35:13.617
taking me to some of the best

35:13.693 --> 35:15.997
state-funded nursing homes,

35:16.194 --> 35:19.474
trying to find a good place to
go before this gets really bad.

35:19.479 --> 35:21.179
What are you talking about?

35:21.571 --> 35:24.701
I will not put this on you, Randall.

35:24.709 --> 35:27.952
- I won't do that to your family.
- It's our family, William.

35:29.763 --> 35:31.662
Look, this is your home now.

35:32.345 --> 35:34.679
You've lived in this home, and...

35:35.497 --> 35:37.466
if it comes to that, you can die in it.

35:37.586 --> 35:39.241
You're not gonna be crawling underneath

35:39.268 --> 35:40.962
someone else's porch like some dog.

35:40.978 --> 35:43.989
- I don't want to do this to you.
- I can take it.

35:47.738 --> 35:50.508
The medication isn't working anymore.

35:52.051 --> 35:54.654
It just makes me feel sicker.

35:58.021 --> 36:00.183
This is not how I wanted to...

36:02.958 --> 36:05.163
Do you want to stop the chemo, William?

36:09.721 --> 36:11.216
Yeah.

36:11.336 --> 36:12.668
Okay.

36:18.589 --> 36:21.176
- It's okay.
- Mm.

36:21.734 --> 36:23.566
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Mm-hmm.

36:23.904 --> 36:25.636
Okay.

36:26.405 --> 36:27.971
We'll stop it.

36:33.317 --> 36:36.582
You must be in a real jam to come to me.

36:37.690 --> 36:39.428
Why do you need the money?

36:39.836 --> 36:41.358
Just in...

36:42.442 --> 36:45.149
a tight spot, is all.

36:46.085 --> 36:47.871
Of course you are.

36:48.866 --> 36:50.695
What's it for?

36:51.141 --> 36:53.066
Women? Gambling?

36:53.437 --> 36:55.960
Something else?

36:56.885 --> 36:58.557
Gambling.

37:02.512 --> 37:05.177
You know, your mother
was bad with money, too.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.619
Yeah, well...

37:13.088 --> 37:15.401
Bad at everything, actually.

37:20.349 --> 37:22.484
Listen, can you help me out?

37:35.495 --> 37:37.338
Look, you were right about me.

37:37.458 --> 37:39.070
You've always been right about me.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.677
I'm no good. I'm never
gonna be any good.

37:40.709 --> 37:43.245
And I come to you, and
I've got my hand out. So...

37:44.656 --> 37:47.433
can you bail me out?

38:33.453 --> 38:34.842
Wait.

38:35.598 --> 38:38.717
- Jack, why are we here?
- Oh, I forgot something. Uh,

38:38.837 --> 38:42.859
this is the money pit
that I've been working on.

38:42.979 --> 38:44.581
Oof.

38:44.984 --> 38:47.523
- Hey, babe?
- Yeah.

38:47.991 --> 38:49.314
What?

38:49.434 --> 38:50.723
I bought it.

38:51.070 --> 38:52.234
What?

38:52.503 --> 38:53.902
Yeah.

38:55.354 --> 38:56.790
How?

38:57.392 --> 39:00.424
I scraped together some
cash and I got a loan

39:00.457 --> 39:02.379
and I sold the Chevelle.

39:02.499 --> 39:05.582
Um, and... and then Ken,
he... he gave this to me

39:05.619 --> 39:08.034
for a really, really good price.

39:08.636 --> 39:10.379
Uh...

39:11.449 --> 39:13.537
Uh, how...

39:13.657 --> 39:17.200
What... what about a...
a down payment though?

39:17.248 --> 39:19.270
Well, we... we had... we had enough.

39:19.292 --> 39:20.905
We had enough stashed away.

39:21.180 --> 39:23.626
Come here. Come look at this.
This place has got great bones.

39:23.627 --> 39:25.493
Look at this kitchen,
huh? How great is this?

39:25.530 --> 39:27.584
You can have, like, a
full range, two counters.

39:27.627 --> 39:29.531
I mean, we've got...
we've got six months

39:29.558 --> 39:32.219
until the babies are born. I
mean, look at the fireplace.

39:32.262 --> 39:34.290
I... I can get a lot done in six months,

39:34.306 --> 39:36.948
you know, at least get
the... the downstairs

39:36.949 --> 39:39.259
and the bathrooms done
so we could use 'em.

39:39.297 --> 39:41.158
I don't know, Jack.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.696
- You need to see upstairs.
- What?

39:42.728 --> 39:44.272
Come on, babe. You need...
you need to see the upstairs.

39:44.277 --> 39:46.590
You got to check this out.

39:46.972 --> 39:48.504
Is that even safe,

39:48.505 --> 39:50.393
- to walk up these?
- Yeah. Oh, no, no, no.

39:50.407 --> 39:52.411
Jimmy laid these. He's a
really good carpenter. Just...

39:52.443 --> 39:55.637
watch that second step.
Come on. Right over it.

39:55.826 --> 39:58.439
Got some work to do.
I'll fix that window.

39:58.482 --> 40:00.520
But I got a beautiful banister.

40:00.580 --> 40:02.263
Babe, we got three bedrooms.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.898
There's one bedroom/bathroom.

40:03.941 --> 40:05.323
This could be the nursery.

40:05.393 --> 40:06.963
And then... Oh, this is the master.

40:06.984 --> 40:08.757
This is the master. It's...

40:09.426 --> 40:10.890
You know, it's all here.

40:10.911 --> 40:13.052
And this is gonna be a great
place to raise a family.

40:13.073 --> 40:14.563
Can you see it?

40:22.835 --> 40:25.928
We need to be quiet so we don't
wake anybody else up, okay?

40:25.960 --> 40:27.725
Shh. Shh.

40:31.575 --> 40:32.887
Shh.

40:32.889 --> 40:34.857
You want to dry off now?

40:35.233 --> 40:38.225
Does everybody feel
clean, ready for a tub?

40:39.085 --> 40:41.244
- No? No?
- No.

40:41.246 --> 40:43.619
- Too dirty.
- You got to go get him.

40:43.665 --> 40:46.234
You got to go get him. Go get him.

41:01.758 --> 41:03.593
Yeah.

41:11.105 --> 41:14.078
- We have a home.
- We have a home.
