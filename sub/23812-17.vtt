09:11.259 --> 09:13.344
No offense.
[giggles]

09:13.427 --> 09:14.595
- None taken.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.180
Creepy is my thing.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.643
- Remember,
idea person...

09:20.726 --> 09:22.186
- ...muscle.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.312
- ...sidekick.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.940
- Here's how
this works, okay?

09:26.023 --> 09:28.567
You sprinkle this attachment
dust on the hand,

09:28.651 --> 09:30.987
and, boom,
you're in business.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.780
- All right.
We'll take the nose picker.

09:36.158 --> 09:36.826
- Four gold pieces?

09:36.909 --> 09:38.661
I'm not sellin'
feet here.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.164
I've only got one hand
you could afford.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.254
- Ew! Where'd you find this--
in the gutter?

09:48.337 --> 09:50.464
- Yes, actually.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.133
Please remember,
if you have any problems,

09:52.216 --> 09:54.176
we have a 100 percent
"I Do Not Care" policy.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.522
- Okay, it's dark out
and I did a survey.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.274
It turns out
nobody wants you here.

10:09.608 --> 10:12.445
- Who's happy
the Princess is here?

10:12.528 --> 10:14.613
- CROWD:
[cheering, hooting]

10:14.697 --> 10:15.948
- They don't count.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.659
- I'm not going
anywhere

10:18.743 --> 10:19.994
until I prove
my Dad wrong.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.832
Hey, Goblingram,
this one goes out to the King.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.668
Dad, you thought
there'd be a ghost here.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.211
- [magic whooshing]

10:29.295 --> 10:31.380
- And you were right!

10:33.382 --> 10:35.593
- Cool party!

10:35.676 --> 10:37.345
Mind if I crash and...

10:37.428 --> 10:39.055
[deep, gravely voice]
possess your Princess?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.016
- Just in case
you get possessed,

10:42.099 --> 10:43.059
and I don't get to
tell you this later.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.935
I told you so.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.153
- CROWD:
[mixed comments, shouting]

10:54.236 --> 10:55.738
- Calm down, everybody.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.990
I'm not possessing
the rest of y'all.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.035
[deep, gravely voice]
Just the Princess.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.703
- Why does she only
use that voice

11:02.787 --> 11:04.538
when she's talking
about me?

11:04.622 --> 11:06.415
- We need to
protect the Princess.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.042
- I got it.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.753
That ghost is about to
have a giant problem.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.673
[grunting]
- Oh, it hurts!

11:14.757 --> 11:16.675
JK! I'm a ghost, dummy.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.595
- Warwick, sunlight will
stop the Shadow Ghost.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.223
Do you have any
spells that will do that?

11:22.306 --> 11:23.474
- You know I do.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.393
Illuminata,
lighty-brighty!

11:26.685 --> 11:28.813
- These are itty-bitty
baby nightlights.

11:28.896 --> 11:32.024
- Okay, some of us just
call them "nightlights."

11:33.609 --> 11:34.944
- Get back!

11:35.027 --> 11:36.695
- Are you seriously
trying to stop me

11:36.779 --> 11:38.739
with itty-bitty
baby nightlights?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.492
- Maybe.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.576
Is it working?

11:42.660 --> 11:45.621
- An itty-bitty
baby bit.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.706
Just so you know,
once those burn out,

11:47.790 --> 11:49.208
your Princess
is toast!

11:50.918 --> 11:52.545
- Why are you
doing this?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.380
- Centuries ago,
I was set to marry

11:54.463 --> 11:55.798
a super-cute prince.

11:55.881 --> 11:59.260
Then one Halloween,
he ran off with his true love...

11:59.343 --> 12:01.721
[deep, gravely voice]
and I never got to be princess!

12:01.804 --> 12:03.597
- Wow. I wonder why
he dumped you.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.932
You seem so nice.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.769
- Ha. Ha.
You're so funny.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.312
[deep, gravely voice]
So's this!

12:10.396 --> 12:13.065
[blowing air]

12:13.149 --> 12:15.317
I'm just full of
surprises, right?

12:16.986 --> 12:19.321
- Run!
- ALL: [screaming]

12:24.577 --> 12:25.661
- Wha...?

12:25.744 --> 12:26.787
I was going to let
you go to the party.

12:26.871 --> 12:31.834
But you seem to have
missed a spot--everywhere!

12:31.917 --> 12:35.171
- Sir Gareth, we actually
have a little gift for you.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.464
- Trying to bribe your
way out of punishment?

12:36.547 --> 12:38.507
He won't fall for that.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.928
- Ah! A new hand!
All is forgiven!

12:43.012 --> 12:44.889
- Oh!
[claps hands]

12:44.972 --> 12:46.098

12:46.932 --> 12:49.101

the attachment dust.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.528
[laughing]

12:59.612 --> 13:00.946
It fits like a glove!

13:01.030 --> 13:02.198
- Which is now something
you can wear on both hands.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.075
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

13:05.159 --> 13:06.160
Look at me!
I can clap again!

Watch this! Watch this!

13:09.997 --> 13:10.956
Here's the church.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.666
Here's the steeple.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.627
Open the door
and here's the people!

13:14.710 --> 13:16.212
Look at them!

13:16.295 --> 13:18.964
- Mm-hm, that's great.
We're going to the party.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.467
- Okay. Okay.
Um...um...have fun!

13:21.550 --> 13:24.136
Uh, Fizz can polish up
the rest of this stuff.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.681
- What? You can't
let them off the hook.

13:27.765 --> 13:28.849
- Of course, he can.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.976
[whispering]
And he just did.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.522
- It took buckets of Go-Away
Goo to get that horn off.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.775
My forehead's
all burned.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.527
- What? Oh, yes,
you're right.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.153
My new hand does
look good.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.863
[laughing]

13:42.947 --> 13:44.657
There are so many
things I wanna...

13:44.740 --> 13:45.783
I wanna do with it.

13:45.866 --> 13:46.325
Where should I start?

13:46.408 --> 13:48.577
[sharp smack]

13:48.661 --> 13:52.456
- With your face.
Good choice.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.707
- That wasn't me.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.794
[grunting]

13:56.877 --> 13:58.629
I think my new
hand is evil!

13:58.712 --> 14:00.881
- No, no, maybe it
just misunderstood.

14:00.965 --> 14:01.298

14:01.382 --> 14:03.425
[screams]

14:03.509 --> 14:04.969
Oh!

14:05.052 --> 14:07.721

You're out of breath.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.441
[laughing]

14:19.525 --> 14:22.111
I miss breathing.

14:22.194 --> 14:22.778
- Okay, look,
the Shadow Ghost

14:22.861 --> 14:24.738
wants to possess
a royal,

14:24.822 --> 14:25.781
so, if you're not the princess,
she'll go away.

14:25.864 --> 14:29.201
- Good idea.
I just need a distraction.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.245
- One charming
distraction coming up.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.498
S'up, Shadow Bae?

14:36.083 --> 14:37.251
You know, you'd be cute,

14:37.334 --> 14:38.877
if you did something
with your hair

14:38.961 --> 14:40.129
and were less dead.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.674
- [gagging]
Ew!

14:43.757 --> 14:47.886
I just ghost barfed
in my mouth.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.888
- You coulda just
said no, but...

14:53.267 --> 14:54.643
- Hey, guys,
how's the party?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.896
- It's taken a bit
of a turn.

14:57.980 --> 14:58.564
- Where's the Princess?!

14:58.647 --> 14:59.815
- Well, you're outta luck.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.067
The guards snuck her
back to the castle

15:02.151 --> 15:04.320
while you pretended to
not be into all of this.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.781
- Give it up, Ghost.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.617
There's no more royalty
here for you to possess.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.160
- Princess,
I know you're here!

15:11.243 --> 15:14.079
I saw your Goblingram
#KingSoWorried.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.124
- Oh, no!

15:17.207 --> 15:19.960
- Not a princess, but...

15:20.044 --> 15:22.296
[deep, gravely voice]
I guess any royal will do.

Bow down to your new leader!

15:40.397 --> 15:42.232
Or curtsey,
if that's your deal.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.443
Whatever!
I have a throne to sit on.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.654
[high-pitched laughter]

15:57.873 --> 16:00.626
- Good. We got here
before the Ghost.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.420
- Yep. Luckily, she jumped
into a super-slow Dad bod.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.051
- Prudy, protect the throne.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.886
We can't let
the Ghost sit on it,

16:10.969 --> 16:13.263
or she'll permanently
possess my Dad.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.475
Dad-King. He's like
a father to all of us.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.770
- Wait, the King
gave the Princess

16:19.853 --> 16:21.397
a Sun Pumpkin
to protect her.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.981
The light from it could send
the Shadow Ghost away for good.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.401
- I bet it's in
the Princess' room.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.153
One of us should go get--
- I'll get it! Me! Me!

16:30.489 --> 16:33.909
- Hey!

16:33.992 --> 16:35.244
I would have been
here sooner,

16:35.327 --> 16:37.705
but I kept tripping
over this ridiculous robe.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.082
But it'll all
be worth it

16:40.165 --> 16:42.167
to sit my ghost butt
on that throne.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.627
- Not if we kick
it, first!

16:44.670 --> 16:46.004
Your butt, not the throne.
It looks expensive.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.593
- Don't worry, my Dad's
terrible with swords.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.929
- Woo! Woo!

16:54.012 --> 16:55.097
Hah!

16:55.180 --> 16:56.932
- But the Ghost
is amazeballs.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.767
- [grunting]

16:58.851 --> 17:00.769
- [magic whooshing]

17:00.853 --> 17:03.856
- [screaming]

17:03.939 --> 17:06.150
No! No!
Not the nose hairs!

17:06.233 --> 17:09.403
They're the only original
things left on my body!

17:09.486 --> 17:10.738
[screams]

17:10.820 --> 17:12.321
You're a monster!

17:12.406 --> 17:14.450
- We have to get
rid of that hand.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.617
- What are we
supposed to do?

17:15.701 --> 17:17.786
The attachment dust
we used is too strong.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.704
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

17:19.788 --> 17:21.080
- I have an idea.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.875
- Shush, Butt, I'm
trying to work on a plan.

17:22.958 --> 17:23.625
- But I already
figured it out.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.752
- Not now!
- Yes, now!

17:25.836 --> 17:27.463
Gosh darn it, Sage!
You never listen to me!

17:27.546 --> 17:29.089
Sometimes sidekicks have
good ideas, too!

17:32.760 --> 17:34.261
- [clears throat]
Whoa.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.057
- It's always
the quiet ones.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.146
- I was just trying to say
all we have to do

17:44.229 --> 17:47.983
is get the evil hand
to punch the dummy.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.359
- How's hitting
Fizz gonna help?

17:51.737 --> 17:54.656
- No, Davey, the Dummy.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.449
- Unh, why not?

17:55.532 --> 17:58.494
- [grunting]

17:58.577 --> 18:01.205
Ah! Wet Willy!

18:02.831 --> 18:04.875
- Hey, Evil Hand!

18:04.958 --> 18:06.543
How's it feel like to know

18:06.627 --> 18:08.504
you're not as strong
as Sir Gareth's old hand?

18:08.587 --> 18:09.797
- Oh!

18:11.423 --> 18:13.884
Why are you
making it angry?

18:13.967 --> 18:15.344
- Just saying.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.638
The old hand could punch right
through the training dummy.

18:17.721 --> 18:21.016
But this one never will.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.851
Ho, hum...

18:22.935 --> 18:23.393
- [grunting]

18:23.477 --> 18:25.729
Ah!

18:25.813 --> 18:26.855
[screams]

18:26.939 --> 18:28.023
Don't listen to them!

18:28.106 --> 18:29.233
You're very strong,

18:29.316 --> 18:30.692
especially when
you're hurting me!

18:31.485 --> 18:33.070
[roaring]

18:33.153 --> 18:35.072
[heavy thud]

18:35.155 --> 18:38.367
I'm stuck!
- Exactly.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.117
I filled it with
Go-Away Goo.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.870
Now the hand
will go away.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.205
It's right in the name.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.541
- [straining]

18:45.624 --> 18:48.710
I'm free!

18:48.794 --> 18:51.505
Oh, I never thought I'd be
so happy to lose a body part.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.049
- Yay!
[giggling]

18:54.132 --> 18:56.051
Yay! Score one
for the muscle!

18:56.134 --> 18:57.261
[giggling]

18:57.344 --> 18:58.804
- [grunting]
