-Yes.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.108
Ah! It's always
so weird when

01:48.149 --> 01:49.609
there's no one
in the audience.

Trust me, you brought
down the house!

know you on Pop Star USA

data from the record label,

02:11.589 --> 02:13.091
and ticket sales
are already up.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.718
Oh, that's great to hear.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.178
Imagine if we threw a
tour and nobody came?

02:17.220 --> 02:18.555

02:18.596 --> 02:20.140
You know, this whole
self-deprecating thing is

02:20.181 --> 02:21.725
charming and all, but you
got to start acting like

02:21.766 --> 02:23.309
the star that you are.

02:23.351 --> 02:26.104
Hey, this is all new to me.
I will never be a diva, Benny.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.522

02:27.564 --> 02:29.024
Know how many clients I've
had who've told me that?

Of course, you're the first
one that I actually believe.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.529
Hey, thanks again,
for putting your trip

02:34.571 --> 02:36.990
back a few days to do this.
This is gonna pay off.

02:37.032 --> 02:40.035
I hope so, because my family
was not thrilled about that.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.953
Yeah, well, they're
gonna get over it.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.288
[Laughing]

02:43.329 --> 02:45.331
[Coughing] Yeah,
you don't know her family.

02:45.373 --> 02:48.001
They get over nothing.
Ever since we were kids.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.878
-It's kind of their thing.
-True.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.338
You know, they know
what's best,

02:51.379 --> 02:53.006
and who am I to tell
them they're wrong?

02:53.048 --> 02:54.507
Well, you could...

02:54.549 --> 02:56.301
-But you don't.
-Okay, guys, time to go.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.053
-Oh.
-Got it?

02:58.094 --> 02:59.387
Time to go. Get your stuff,
get your stuff.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.724
Alright.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.685
I just got a text from the
President of Blue Six Records.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.645
They are quite
pleased with you, Jay.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.189
Oh, that's amazing!

03:09.230 --> 03:10.940
But did they ever
listen to my songs?

03:10.982 --> 03:12.609
Look, they invested
a lot in you.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.944
That's why they rented out
studio in your town

03:14.986 --> 03:16.571
for you to rehearse
over Christmas.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.740
It's why they're flying
in Tyler Huston

03:18.782 --> 03:20.241
to teach you choreography.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.203
Well, that sounds great, but
I'm gonna take that as 'no'.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.537
I'm just a
commodity to them.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.331
Well, a little bit,
welcome to LA.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.708
No, Benny, listen...

03:28.750 --> 03:31.670
In my culture,
music is not just music.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.922
It is a soundtrack
of our lives.

03:33.963 --> 03:36.257
It's a part of every moment,

03:36.299 --> 03:39.219
and I want to give the
fans the music

03:39.260 --> 03:42.555
that has been a gift to me,
my whole life!

03:42.597 --> 03:45.517
I could be a crossover
artist, both markets.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.435
Sing songs in
English and Spanish.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.562
Yes, you can, but,
right now, they have

03:49.604 --> 03:52.399
fantastic writers working on
material just for you.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.650
Like,
the best of the best.

-Exactly!

03:56.653 --> 03:58.697
It's like working
with my family.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.573
Everyone else knows
what's best for me,

04:00.615 --> 04:03.410
but no one cares
what I want or think.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.744
Look, you are new
on the scene,

04:04.786 --> 04:06.371
and we have to go with
the momentum.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.706
You have to prove
to the label that

04:07.747 --> 04:11.251
you are a team player.
Remember the plan, okay.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.460
We're gonna get
to your songs.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.045
You just gotta be patient.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.506
Hey! I'm not gonna let
you down, Jay.

04:16.548 --> 04:19.300
You're like the
daughter I never had.

04:19.342 --> 04:20.885
You have two
daughters, Benny.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.178
Yeah, but they're five.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.222
You're like the grown up
daughter I never had.

some of that Spanish.

was nice, right?

-What's going on?

know where I live?

resourceful.

Wow.

You think that guy...

05:35.835 --> 05:37.003
put these here?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.672
No, no, he knows to
stay on public property.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.423
He just wants to get a
candid shot of you

05:40.465 --> 05:41.675

in your mouth.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.177

was in here.

In here.

Okay...

05:54.562 --> 05:57.482
-Thank you.
-So, good news...

05:57.524 --> 06:00.443
There's no signs of
forced entry inside.

there's gonna be nothing

and the flowers,

06:31.433 --> 06:32.392

gonna be ours,

06:32.434 --> 06:36.146

at the label.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.659
-About this?
-Yes, I had to text her.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.828
Somebody came
onto the property.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.329
What are the odds she
listened to some of

06:53.371 --> 06:55.874
Jay's songs and wants to
add them to the tour?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.292
Not so great.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.835
They want to get security
and they got this company

06:58.877 --> 07:00.170
they like to use.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.797
So, okay, that's not all.
Ah, the security guy,

07:02.839 --> 07:05.550
they want him to be
with you 24/7.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.843
What does that mean?

07:06.885 --> 07:08.887
That means that he goes
home with you to...

07:08.928 --> 07:12.015
to, where is it
you're from again?

07:12.057 --> 07:13.224
Squirrel Hollow.

that's gotta be made up.

You don't know my family.

home with me for Christmas.

I'll be divorced by Friday.

We don't want that, but
I'm not asking for this.

They get to call the shots.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.964
Are they overreacting?
Probably.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.218
Do we want to rock the boat
this close to the tour?

36:50.752 --> 36:52.087
Is this one of the
Christmas traditions

36:52.128 --> 36:53.421
I'm supposed to
be embracing?

36:53.463 --> 36:55.340
It is.
Por supuesto.

36:55.382 --> 36:57.175
But don't worry, all you
have to do is hold some

36:57.217 --> 36:59.302
frankincense and follow
along with the rest, right?

36:59.344 --> 37:00.929
Exactamente.
[Laughing]

37:00.970 --> 37:03.390
Okay, and you are...
Mary?

37:03.431 --> 37:04.849
Great guess, but no,

37:04.891 --> 37:07.185
this year I've been
replaced by Faith.

37:07.227 --> 37:09.187
And that's what we
call typecasting.

37:09.229 --> 37:10.522
[Laughing]

37:10.563 --> 37:12.649
-Got it.
-Show biz.

37:12.691 --> 37:14.693
Ah, can I chat with
you for a second?

37:14.734 --> 37:17.946
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

37:17.987 --> 37:19.531
[Hushed] Look,
I have to,

37:19.572 --> 37:21.032
I have to walk down to
the town square.

37:21.074 --> 37:23.827
And check out in daylight
exactly how much

37:23.868 --> 37:25.662
you're gonna be
exposed on stage.

37:25.704 --> 37:27.205
-Exposed?
-Yeah, so...

37:27.247 --> 37:29.541
Just stay with
your family while I'm gone.

37:29.582 --> 37:33.753
And, look at me-
don't leave the house.

37:33.795 --> 37:35.588
I won't go anywhere.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.549
I will be at the house
making sure that

37:37.590 --> 37:40.677
your costume fits, okay?

37:40.719 --> 37:43.722
-How's that sound?
-That's great news.

37:43.763 --> 37:45.223
-See you in a bit.
-Okay.

37:45.265 --> 37:46.725
Okay.

[Fans squealing & shouting]
Jaylen! Jaylen!

37:50.687 --> 37:52.063
[Fan] Ah! Can you go
get Jaylen?!

37:52.105 --> 37:55.108
[Fans] Where's Jaylen?
Hi! Can you get Jaylen?

37:55.150 --> 37:57.152
Come back tonight
for Nacimiento.

37:57.193 --> 37:59.446
She'll take a selfie with you.
Now go home!

37:59.487 --> 38:01.781
Go, get out of here!

38:01.823 --> 38:04.492
You too, man,
get out of here!

Stop it! Already?

38:20.216 --> 38:23.303
It is all happening,
take this in.

38:23.345 --> 38:25.096
This is your time.

38:25.138 --> 38:27.098
You're right, and
I am, Benny, but-

38:27.140 --> 38:28.641
I don't want to sound
ungrateful here,

38:28.683 --> 38:30.560
but you know I want
to perform as me.

38:30.602 --> 38:32.604
My songs, my voice.

38:32.645 --> 38:34.356
English and Spanish,
remember?

38:34.397 --> 38:36.399
And you will, eventually,
but for right now,

38:36.441 --> 38:37.859
I want you to enjoy Christmas,

38:37.901 --> 38:39.944
and you let me take
care of the rest, okay?

38:39.986 --> 38:41.613
Eyes on the prize.

We're going to Miami!

[Matt] I'm not coming out.

38:54.501 --> 38:55.835
Come on, Matt, it's time.

38:55.877 --> 38:57.921
I can't wear this.

38:57.962 --> 38:59.381
Come on, I'm not
gonna laugh at you.

39:05.887 --> 39:07.263
Okay, maybe I'm
gonna laugh a little,

39:07.305 --> 39:08.973
but only 'cause
you look so good.

39:09.015 --> 39:11.267
Alright,
don't you patronize me.

39:11.309 --> 39:14.521
-I look ridiculous!
-It's gonna be fine.

39:14.562 --> 39:17.691
This is the weirdest
assignment I've ever had.

39:17.732 --> 39:19.984
Now remind me again why
I agreed to do this?

39:20.026 --> 39:22.362
'Cause you're
getting paid, ding!

39:22.404 --> 39:23.947
Not nearly enough.

39:23.988 --> 39:26.658
Well, then, I'll put in a good
word with the label, okay?

39:26.700 --> 39:29.786
Now come on, Frankincense,
it's show time.

39:29.828 --> 39:31.663

39:31.705 --> 39:35.792

-Okay...

Can you, ah, come help me
carry some groceries

39:37.752 --> 39:39.587
from my truck?

Sure.

40:06.573 --> 40:09.576
I found one of these notes
at the bar last night.

40:09.617 --> 40:11.619
Also unsigned.

40:11.661 --> 40:13.079
This one was on
the porch today,

40:13.121 --> 40:14.539
but I figured it was from
one of the lookie-loo's

40:14.581 --> 40:16.416
camped out outside.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.209
No, I don't think so.

You think it's something
to worry about?

40:21.504 --> 40:24.299
No, no, I...

40:24.341 --> 40:27.802
It's probably just fan mail,
you know.

40:27.844 --> 40:30.096
That's the gig,
she's a big star now.

40:30.138 --> 40:33.058
[Sighing]
La Cobaya is a star.

40:33.099 --> 40:35.977
Not sure I'll ever
get used to that.

40:36.019 --> 40:38.146
But I don't think we should
tell her about the notes.

40:38.188 --> 40:41.024
I don't want to
worry her or Abuela.

40:41.066 --> 40:43.568
No, this is just
between you and me.

Okay? I promise you,
Hector,

40:46.571 --> 40:47.781
nothing's gonna
happen to her.

40:47.822 --> 40:49.366
Not on my watch, okay?

40:49.407 --> 40:51.534
Now that's the attitude
I was looking for.

40:51.576 --> 40:52.994
Yeah?

40:57.916 --> 41:00.418
And the wise men
came from the East,

41:00.460 --> 41:05.465
followed by the star that
led them to Bethlehem.

41:05.507 --> 41:07.384
To the manger.

She was having contractions
the other night,

41:39.624 --> 41:40.875
but they said they
were Braxton Hicks,

41:40.917 --> 41:42.711

Do we go back?

Okay, you take her
to the hospital.

41:51.928 --> 41:53.221
I don't think you want to
have a baby in a

41:53.263 --> 41:54.848
cold manger, this day
and age, would you?

41:54.889 --> 41:56.266

-No.

have let you play Mary,

Jesus has arrived,

the opening number tomorrow.

rehearsal taking place?

out the space first.

studio is clean.

very important

rehearse from 9 to 12.

-Oh...

over the new songs.

have a minute?

meaning to reach out,

what to say, Jay.

I do know why you didn't want
me to come to LA though.

43:40.662 --> 43:44.791
All I wanted was for you
to show up, and you didn't.

43:44.833 --> 43:46.001
That wasn't gonna change

43:46.042 --> 43:47.460
just because
our address did.

43:47.502 --> 43:48.586
I know.

and the poetry thing,

Be better how?
By writing notes or something?

Come on, man.
Look, I know I'm too late,

44:02.017 --> 44:04.477

what happened to us.

46:27.328 --> 46:31.166
Ah, okay, phenomenal
is a stretch.

46:31.207 --> 46:33.126
Really, ah...

46:33.168 --> 46:35.128
it was more exceptional.

46:35.170 --> 46:37.964
[Laughing]

46:38.006 --> 46:39.966
Okay, so you're
funny sometimes.

46:40.008 --> 46:43.636
-Sure, maybe.
-[Laughing]

46:43.678 --> 46:47.140
I know, my family's
not perfect and,

46:47.182 --> 46:49.017
no one's is, and...

46:49.059 --> 46:54.356
Ultimately, when you find the
people that let you be you...

46:54.397 --> 46:58.151
So, why don't they let
you be you in your career?

46:58.193 --> 47:01.237
Well, sometimes family and...

47:01.279 --> 47:06.576
record label, and the public,
even, they...

47:06.618 --> 47:11.498
they think they can
decide who you are.

47:11.539 --> 47:15.960
And, you have to live up
to their expectations.

47:16.002 --> 47:18.630
So, I do as I'm told.

47:18.672 --> 47:21.091
Yeah.

47:21.132 --> 47:24.344
Look, let me say this.

47:24.386 --> 47:28.264
In the Navy,
when we wanted to...

47:28.306 --> 47:30.850
accomplish a task...

47:30.892 --> 47:32.477
we would...

47:32.519 --> 47:35.355
plot, plan...

47:35.397 --> 47:37.357
and execute.

47:37.399 --> 47:39.776
I, personally, wouldn't
outsource something

47:39.818 --> 47:42.779
important as, say,

47:42.821 --> 47:46.032
trying to get an
executive at a label to

47:46.074 --> 47:48.201
listen to my songs.

47:48.243 --> 47:50.662
No.

47:50.704 --> 47:53.998
No, you, you wouldn't,
you would...

47:54.040 --> 47:58.044
plot, plan, and execute, right?

47:58.086 --> 48:00.588
And, you're stuck
with me and,

48:00.630 --> 48:02.549
hey, you wouldn't want me
to tell the label that

48:02.590 --> 48:05.218
you couldn't execute it.

48:05.260 --> 48:06.803
[Laughing]

48:06.845 --> 48:09.222
Okay.

Well...

48:12.809 --> 48:15.895
I'm here.

48:15.937 --> 48:17.689
But...

48:17.731 --> 48:20.734
you are not getting me
in another costume.

your heart out,

Then the other dancers
come in, and here is the lift.

Yeah, that, that's great,
but it's not gonna work.

-Yeah, like that.

Cool.

count you guys down,

But, in the vein of plot,
plan, and execute,

50:47.672 --> 50:50.717
I've come up with an idea.

I don't need to
wait on Benny.

Mexican holiday tradition,

51:32.592 --> 51:34.636
and everyone has a role.

51:34.678 --> 51:37.138
Matt and Jaylen, you are
the corn husk handlers.

You remove them from
the water and dry them.

51:39.474 --> 51:41.059

on the husk...

Mm, then hand
them to me.

you plot, plan and execute,

label is an auto-reply that

unsolicited material"?

we do what we know.

56:37.272 --> 56:40.400

56:40.442 --> 56:45.405
But I can also see that
box you've been put in.

56:45.447 --> 56:47.240
And I don't think
that's fair to you.

56:47.282 --> 56:51.119
Yet I do what's
expected of me.

56:51.161 --> 56:54.789
Yeah, but you didn't do
that at the audition.

56:54.831 --> 56:58.126
And you won.

56:58.168 --> 57:00.170
What was different then?

57:00.211 --> 57:04.424
*

57:04.466 --> 57:07.969
I don't think any of us
thought I was gonna win.

57:08.011 --> 57:10.680
Not that they didn't
believe in me, but...

57:10.722 --> 57:13.433
The odds weren't
in my favor.

57:13.475 --> 57:15.935
The only person who
thought I had a shot was...

57:15.977 --> 57:18.021
Lorelei.

57:18.063 --> 57:19.981
It was how she convinced
me to go with her.

57:20.023 --> 57:22.317
Wow, you went
because of Lorelei?

57:22.359 --> 57:26.529
She gave me the
confidence to join her.

57:26.571 --> 57:30.492
And my life hasn't
been the same since.

57:30.533 --> 57:32.452
You can do it again.

57:32.494 --> 57:37.582
With your family,
with the label, right now.

with you, Mija.

58:12.867 --> 58:14.828
Here at the piano.

58:14.869 --> 58:16.996
In church.

58:17.038 --> 58:21.501
I know, I do too.

58:21.543 --> 58:24.004
You know...

58:24.045 --> 58:26.923
When I was a girl...

58:26.965 --> 58:32.178
I wanted to be a singer,
just like you.

58:32.220 --> 58:34.222
Then, I met Abuelo.

58:34.264 --> 58:36.641
Abuela, you would
have been amazing!

58:36.683 --> 58:40.937
No, it was a very
short time in my life.

58:40.979 --> 58:43.273
There weren't enough
opportunities for girls

58:43.314 --> 58:48.403
like me, my age, in Mexico,
or anywhere else.

58:48.445 --> 58:51.281
People will like to take
advantage of the young

58:51.322 --> 58:56.244
and naive, who were
looking for a better life.

58:56.286 --> 58:59.914
Abuela, I can't imagine
you ever being naive.

58:59.956 --> 59:06.212
Ah, well, that is because my
papi told it to me straight.

59:06.254 --> 59:10.633
And you,
you taught me.

59:10.675 --> 59:13.636
So, you don't have
to worry about me.

59:13.678 --> 59:14.804
[Speaking Spanish]

59:14.846 --> 59:18.141
My love of music
comes from you.

59:18.183 --> 59:20.602
But sometimes,
we have to leave home,

59:20.643 --> 59:23.355
to find greatness.

59:23.396 --> 59:27.317
Like you and Abuelo did,
you know?

59:27.359 --> 59:32.238
But knowing you are
out there, all alone.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.742
I am not all alone, okay?
I have-

59:35.784 --> 59:38.787
Matt, I know, of course.

59:38.828 --> 59:43.833
I'm happy you found him.

59:43.875 --> 59:46.670
Yeah, I feel like...

59:46.711 --> 59:51.758
Like Matt really sees me.

59:51.800 --> 59:56.388
Mi papa, used to say...

59:56.429 --> 59:59.099
"Find a man who will
jump in front of

59:59.140 --> 1:00:03.269
a moving train to save you."

1:00:03.311 --> 1:00:05.480
I found that in Abuelo.

1:00:05.522 --> 1:00:09.984
You and Abuelo had
a love for the ages.

1:00:10.026 --> 1:00:13.613
Ah, I'm not sure how
Matt feels about me.

1:00:13.655 --> 1:00:17.075
It's very clear he will jump
in front of a train for you!

1:00:17.117 --> 1:00:20.203
There's a reason for that.
[Laughing]

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:26.584
That's because my boyfriend
is totally a good guy.

1:00:29.045 --> 1:00:31.172
But he...

1:00:31.214 --> 1:00:34.592
He has some walls up.

1:00:34.634 --> 1:00:41.099
Some hearts are harder
to reach than others.

1:00:41.141 --> 1:00:45.353
But I believe his
already belongs to you.

I just came home to
get Faith's book,

1:01:27.937 --> 1:01:29.606
and I found this.

1:01:29.647 --> 1:01:30.899
Why is this person going
to so much trouble

1:01:30.940 --> 1:01:32.859

get near her, okay.

Hm, I'm sad to miss
Luminarias tonight.

But, as long as Faith and
the baby are in the hospital,

1:01:46.247 --> 1:01:47.624
I'll stay there with them.

answer to everything.

So, what do you think
of Squirrel Hollow?

1:02:01.805 --> 1:02:05.934
I think this town and your
family are wonderful, but...

1:02:05.975 --> 1:02:08.812
I think the sooner we get out
of here and go back to LA,

1:02:08.853 --> 1:02:10.188
the better.

1:02:10.230 --> 1:02:11.856
What happens
when we get back?

1:02:11.898 --> 1:02:14.734
I don't know, I guess
that's up to the label.

1:02:14.776 --> 1:02:16.486
So, your assignment's done
and you never see me again,

1:02:16.528 --> 1:02:18.071
is that what you're saying?

1:02:18.113 --> 1:02:19.906
No, no, that's not
what I said.

1:02:19.948 --> 1:02:21.616
Do you want to
keep seeing me?

1:02:21.658 --> 1:02:23.284
Ah, do you?

1:02:23.326 --> 1:02:26.329
Don't deflect,
I asked you first.

Listen, I'm not,
I'm not deflecting.

1:02:28.998 --> 1:02:32.043
Just...

1:02:32.085 --> 1:02:33.253
I don't think it'd be
professional

1:02:33.294 --> 1:02:34.462
for me to answer that.

1:02:34.504 --> 1:02:36.214
Oh, come on, this hasn't
been professional

1:02:36.256 --> 1:02:38.299
since you put on a
wise man costume.

1:02:38.341 --> 1:02:39.592
That was pretty
much forced on me.

pretend with me.

That's all I've been doing,
all day and all night,

1:02:47.350 --> 1:02:49.477
is just pretending in
front of your family.

1:02:49.519 --> 1:02:52.313
Then stop pretending, and tell
me what you're thinking.

We place luminarias
along the walkway,

1:03:43.907 --> 1:03:45.533
as they were thought to be
a guide to help

1:03:45.575 --> 1:03:47.702
Mary and Joseph find
their way home.

1:03:47.744 --> 1:03:50.622
And then,
we make a wish.

1:03:50.663 --> 1:03:53.124
Abuelo believed
that as they burn,

1:03:53.166 --> 1:03:56.920
they put our wishes out
into the sky, and then...

1:03:56.961 --> 1:03:58.254
they come true.

1:03:58.296 --> 1:04:00.090
One of my last luminarias
was right before I left

1:04:00.131 --> 1:04:01.925
for the LA audition so,

1:04:01.966 --> 1:04:03.259

putting out there.

think about it.

1:17:26.604 --> 1:17:27.981
[Laughing]

1:17:28.023 --> 1:17:29.983
Well, what can I say?

1:17:30.025 --> 1:17:32.694
We Rodriguez's love hard.

1:17:32.736 --> 1:17:36.031
Look, I'm not a Rodriguez.

1:17:36.072 --> 1:17:38.575
I'm just the hired help.

1:17:38.616 --> 1:17:40.785
And I know better not to get
emotionally involved.

1:17:40.827 --> 1:17:43.496
Oh, wah-wah, poor you.

1:17:43.538 --> 1:17:45.665
This family welcomed you,
with open arms,

1:17:45.707 --> 1:17:50.879
and you became a Rodriguez
whether you liked it or not.

1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:53.173
You know...

1:17:53.214 --> 1:17:55.175
Just for a minute...

1:17:55.216 --> 1:17:56.426
I got to feel what it
was like to be

1:17:56.468 --> 1:17:58.803
a part of something that...

1:17:58.845 --> 1:18:00.847
that wasn't temporary.

1:18:00.889 --> 1:18:03.808
Yeah, I know this was a job
and you were putting on

1:18:03.850 --> 1:18:07.687
a show, but I know a thing
or two about people.

1:18:07.729 --> 1:18:11.191
And, you're not that
good of an actor.

1:18:11.232 --> 1:18:13.068
Well, thanks
for the compliment.

1:18:13.109 --> 1:18:15.862
All of this was real for you.

1:18:18.865 --> 1:18:22.202
Maybe.

1:18:22.243 --> 1:18:24.162
But then,
I underestimated her.

1:18:24.204 --> 1:18:25.997
So, did I.

1:18:26.039 --> 1:18:28.708
All her life,
and she still loves me.

1:18:28.750 --> 1:18:31.169
Go to her!

How much is this
gonna set me back?

1:19:06.329 --> 1:19:08.873
Aye! It's our first
grandchild and I'm going to

1:19:08.915 --> 1:19:11.251
spoil her rotten, and you're
going to accept that.

1:19:11.292 --> 1:19:13.712
Understood.

1:19:13.753 --> 1:19:16.506
Where is he going?
It's time to open presents.

1:19:16.548 --> 1:19:18.758
Yeah, I have something
to say, and I'll,

1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:22.095
I'll tell Hector
when he gets back in.

Well, I'm sure you two will
find a way to work things out.

He cares very much
for you, you know.

wise man was alone...

1:20:48.264 --> 1:20:51.434
without his trusting
companions...

1:20:51.476 --> 1:20:55.313
he traveled far and wide,

1:20:55.355 --> 1:20:57.524
searching high and low,

1:20:57.565 --> 1:21:00.402
for the family he
only dreamed of.

1:21:00.443 --> 1:21:03.780
And followed the star
that led him home.

1:21:03.822 --> 1:21:09.911
Of course, this star
was a pop star.

he spent his life...
