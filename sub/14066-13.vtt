NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Boston Legal...

00:02.794 --> 00:05.296
-Jerry, what's wrong?
-It's a "Dear John" letter from Leigh.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.507
She's leaving me for an iPhone.

00:07.590 --> 00:11.302
Leigh is-- Well, I believe
the American term, a total nut job.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.638
Would you like to give us a try again?

00:13.722 --> 00:16.057
-I don't know what to say.
-How about yes?

00:16.141 --> 00:17.225
I'm surprised at you, Shirley.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.811
Your fairness compass is always spot-on.
It's fritzing out here.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.229
We're now having a fight?

00:21.312 --> 00:23.273
Which you're losing, and that bothers you.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.566
I don't know, Denny. Maybe...

00:25.316 --> 00:26.651
Shirley and I aren't right for each other.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.320
-Shirley.
-Ah, Carl, still alive. Well...

00:29.904 --> 00:30.947
That's mature.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.209
-Leigh, hello.
-LEIGH: Hello.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.336
I'm afraid Jerry's not here at the moment.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.215
Actually, I came to see you. Hello.

00:50.091 --> 00:50.925
Hello.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.636
Jerry and I have endeavored
to get back together.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.346
Yes, I heard. That's wonderful.

00:55.638 --> 00:59.684
Is it? Well, that would seem at odds
with some of your reflections

00:59.768 --> 01:02.896
which you shared with Jerry
during our brief estrangement period.

01:03.938 --> 01:04.773
I'm sorry?

01:06.107 --> 01:09.986
Jerry shared with me that you
encouraged him to forget me.

01:10.612 --> 01:14.407
You said he could do much better
than me, given that I'm a weirdo.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.201
(chuckles) Well... (clears throat)

01:16.284 --> 01:19.329
That wasn't-- That wasn't
exactly the expression I used.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.581
No. You said "nut job."

01:22.624 --> 01:24.459
I... Jerry was in pain.

01:24.542 --> 01:28.004
I was simply trying
to make him feel better.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.590
Is that something that tends
to lift a person's spirits?

01:30.673 --> 01:33.760
-Calling others nut jobs?
-I apologize. I just--

01:33.843 --> 01:36.096
I don't want you sharing
an office with him any longer.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.680
-I beg your pardon?
-Moreover,

01:37.764 --> 01:39.140
I don't want you talking to him.

01:39.724 --> 01:42.727
With all due respect, Leigh, I don't
think you have the right to ask that.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.271
Oh, let me demand it then.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.691
If you talk to Jerry,
I may have violent urges.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.318
I assure you, you don't want that.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.114
Stay away from my man, Katie.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.450
That's my last warning.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.336
-Shirl?
-Andrea! How are you?

02:08.419 --> 02:10.755
-Oh, you know me, causing trouble.
-What now?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.842
-Well, I'm suing my town.
-Asbestos?

02:13.925 --> 02:15.760
-Did that.
-Power lines?

02:15.844 --> 02:17.637
-Keep going.
-Hazardous waste?

02:17.720 --> 02:20.557
All right, here's a clue.
Am I glowing? That's right.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.227
My wonderful little town of Belmont Falls
wants to build a nuclear power plant.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.728
I want to enjoin them.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.439
Andrea, do you have
to take up every cause?

02:28.523 --> 02:31.484
-It makes me feel sexy. Horny, too.
-Hello.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.154
Is he any good?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.238
(scoffs)

02:35.321 --> 02:37.532
Not bad actually, but a sprinter.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.535
-How much notice do you need?
-Ready now.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.744
-What do you got?
-Mad cow.

02:41.828 --> 02:42.829
Condoms?

02:44.372 --> 02:48.168
Denny Crane. To serve... and protect.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.673

02:53.798 --> 02:55.425

03:20.200 --> 03:21.159
(knocks on door)

03:22.952 --> 03:25.747
You're smoking! Why didn't you call me?

03:25.830 --> 03:28.958
Alan, I just had sex with a stranger.
Didn't even get her name.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.544
She was phenomenal.
And I didn't have to pay for it.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.088
-When did this happen?
-Ten minutes ago. Right here.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.840
You had sex ten minutes ago?

03:35.924 --> 03:38.051
Finished nine minutes ago.
I was incredible.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.303
-Alan.
-Denny just had sex.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.223
Glad to hear it. I could use you
on a pretty important case if you're free.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.140
-Actually--
-Thank you.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.059
We're meeting
in the conference room ASAP.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.560
Still aroused if you want in.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.354
Rain check.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.316
I love it when I don't know their names.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.488
The biggest thing going for you
is their start-up costs.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.031
Nuclear power plants typically

04:00.114 --> 04:02.116
take up to four billion
just to get off the ground.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.953
Public opposition and red tape
can sometimes double that.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.539
But you can assume they've already
spent millions just getting this far.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.000
Wow. Now I really am glowing.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.710
Andrea Michele, the client.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.171
I'm told it's all about keeping
the customer happy here.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.548
-You are?
-This would be Alan Shore.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.009
Give me one week
and I'll get rid of that baby fat.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.178
I'm rather fond of my baby fat.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.265
-Great. Then you'll love mine.
-SHIRLEY: Uh, Andrea.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.141
Can we just get serious
about this case for a minute?

04:27.225 --> 04:28.351
ANDREA: Oh, I'm very serious.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.812
-Where shall we go to discuss it?
-How about my desk?

04:30.895 --> 04:35.024
Well, well, a little windmill tilting.
How fun. Don't get up.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.027
Looks painful.
Shirley, you still look fantastic.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.406
Cream and sugar for me. Jack Ross.
Don't speak. It'll ruin it for me.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.699
You would be the client.

04:42.782 --> 04:43.950
-Jack?
-You remember.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.618
And here I thought it was just physical.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.912
You heard me say cream and sugar, right?

04:47.996 --> 04:50.290
This is for you, Shirley, because I care.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.499
What is it?

04:51.582 --> 04:53.084
Well, I would call it
a righteous complaint

04:53.167 --> 04:55.086
suing Miss Michele
for defamation and libel.

04:55.169 --> 04:58.006
You might characterize it as a SLAPP suit
designed to send a message

04:58.089 --> 05:00.466
to other potential plaintiffs,
"It'll cost them."

05:00.883 --> 05:02.260
Okay, tea then.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.345
Does the old guy talk?

05:05.888 --> 05:07.181
You used to be taller.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.561
Uh, everybody out now, please.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.148
Except you, Jack. You stay. Go.

05:17.692 --> 05:18.693
He's cute.

05:18.776 --> 05:19.736
Tell a friend.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.829
Still trying to impress me
after all these years?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.497
I am. Did I?

05:32.248 --> 05:33.166
Maybe a little.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.418
I meant the part about you
still looking fantastic.

05:36.127 --> 05:39.505
Thank you. Can we talk about this case?

05:39.589 --> 05:43.968
Fine. I'm about saving the planet.
What are you up to?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.094
With nuclear energy?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.846
Well, you're not gonna get
it done driving your hybrid.

05:46.929 --> 05:47.972
You do drive one, I hope?

05:49.932 --> 05:52.060
-How have you been?
-I've been good.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.437
-How many kids?
-Six.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.314
All of them great. Kim's doing well.

05:56.939 --> 06:00.151
-She still teaching?
-She is. And what about you?

06:00.234 --> 06:01.903
How are all the spouses?

06:01.986 --> 06:05.782
Funny. I'm between husbands at the moment.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.367
Well, if I were single...

06:10.536 --> 06:11.537
I have to say...

06:12.830 --> 06:16.292
I am very happy to see you
still tilting at windmills, Shirley.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.630
See you in court, Jack.

06:21.964 --> 06:22.799
It's a date.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.693
-Morning.
-Morning, Jerry.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.948
-That's quite a tie.
-Leigh picked it.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.534
She likes bow ties.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.661
Leigh paid me a little visit this morning.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.996
-She did?
-Other than demanding I not speak to you,

06:54.080 --> 06:56.040
and her threatening me with violence,

06:56.124 --> 06:57.583
it was quite
a pleasant encounter actually.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.335
Excuse me?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.337
She's quite cross
that I called her a nut job.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.257
What possibly possessed you
to tell her I said that, Jerry?

07:05.550 --> 07:06.843
-Well--
-Here I am

07:06.926 --> 07:10.012
trying to mitigate some of your pain
and you repeat my words.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.681
It was a betrayal, Jerry.

07:14.058 --> 07:17.770
I'm sorry. I don't know why I shared that.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.398
I was not trying to alienate you from her.
I promise.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.275
How dare she enter my office,

07:22.358 --> 07:24.902
demand I stop communicating with you,
threaten me physically?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.446
She's not a well person.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.951
I'll speak to her.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.459
So, Jack Ross?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.546
Small world, I guess.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.300
No, Shirley. It's a big world actually.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.553
The fact that you seem to have
had sex with everybody in it--

07:51.137 --> 07:52.346
That isn't nice.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.643
So, what's the story with him?

07:59.687 --> 08:03.733
We went out in law school.
That's about it.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.740
A nuclear bomb?

08:10.823 --> 08:12.867
-(chuckles)
-In Belmont Falls?

08:12.950 --> 08:14.952
A nuclear power plant, Judge.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.871
A small difference if you're into details.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.664
One destroys the planet.
The other saves it.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.168
Too much minutiae? I can take criticism.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.129
One for yes. Two for no.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.549
-I think he loves me.
-That's enough!

08:29.300 --> 08:31.594
Mr. Shore, start your case.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.804
-And make it quick.
-I'll make it very quick.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.307
A nuclear power plant
jeopardizes the health and safety

08:36.390 --> 08:37.934
of everyone in Belmont Falls.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.353
Actually it doesn't.
But don't let the facts stop you.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.231
Let me call a witness, Judge. I can
tell you everything you need to know.

08:43.314 --> 08:46.108
-One o'clock.
-Wait! It's my motion!

08:46.192 --> 08:49.111
One o'clock. We're adjourned!

08:50.905 --> 08:53.616
Look, nothing personal.
Client wants me to put on a show.

08:53.699 --> 08:57.203
I promise underneath all the bluster
I'm a complete ass.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.872
Well, it's 10:30 now.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.707
We don't have to be back until 1:00.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.543
What do we do in the meantime?

09:03.918 --> 09:06.921
And I mean the entire meantime.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.053
Did you actually say those things?

09:15.471 --> 09:16.305
I did.

09:17.765 --> 09:21.686
I have no excuse.
Jerry, I'm deeply ashamed.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.982
-I don't understand.
-I feel hugely threatened by her.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.943
-I get this vibe.
-What vibe?

09:29.026 --> 09:30.111
That you like her.

09:30.194 --> 09:33.072
That if she were available,
you'd prefer her.

09:33.948 --> 09:34.865
Would you?

09:37.118 --> 09:41.581
No! Katie is a friend and a colleague.
Nothing more.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.377
I'll apologize. I'm so sorry.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.712
(clicks tongue)

09:52.633 --> 09:53.509
(door closes)

09:54.135 --> 09:56.721
Nuclear power plants.
There's a blast from the past.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.559
-You're glowing.
-Funny.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.978
No, really, you're glowing.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.023
You've had sex?

10:08.482 --> 10:10.610
I have actually. (chuckles)

10:11.235 --> 10:12.069
Tell me.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.698
Her name is Andrea. She's...

10:20.745 --> 10:24.582
This woman is completely untamed.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.793
She brought out
the degenerate me I so miss.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.838
I felt liberated. I got to be everything

10:30.921 --> 10:33.883
I and others so loathe about myself.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.969
(both chuckling)

10:37.053 --> 10:38.304
First I had stranger sex.

10:38.387 --> 10:40.681
-Now you with, uh, Andrea.
-Yes.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.850
Oh, it's like sharing.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.770
It's almost as if we had sex
together in a way.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.231
Almost.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.858
Alan, I want to ask you something.

10:50.941 --> 10:51.901
I've never done this before.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.403
You probably have. But I-I haven't.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.530
I don't like where this is going.

10:56.864 --> 11:00.326
Alan, I've always wanted
to do a little swinging.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.497
And it sounds like our girls
would go for it.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.627
I'm afraid seeing you naked
could make me...

11:10.294 --> 11:12.463
Well, it could be in the dark.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.383
-Even so.
-Well, different rooms.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.510
Come on, Alan.

11:17.593 --> 11:21.347
Once, before we go, let's swing.

11:22.556 --> 11:23.683
(nervous chuckle)

11:29.230 --> 11:30.064
LEIGH: Katie?

11:31.190 --> 11:34.068
Jerry told me about your conversation
and I feel just awful.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.986
-As well you should, I must say.
-Yes.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.656
Had I known that you were such
a wimpy little crybaby,

11:38.739 --> 11:40.991
I never would've bothered with you,
I promise.

11:41.450 --> 11:45.037
Anyway, for Jerry, I'm apologizing.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.416
Other than that, watch your back.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.759
A nuclear power plant
is actually very simple.

11:59.427 --> 12:03.097
We boil water to create steam
to turn a turbine to make electricity.

12:03.180 --> 12:07.059
But instead of burning fuel
to generate heat, we use nuclear fission.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.978
-What about greenhouse gases?
-None.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.146
-Acid rain?
-None.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.355
-Urban smog?
-None.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.023
It's one of the greenest ways we can go.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.610
Is it safe? We all remember Chernobyl.

12:16.694 --> 12:20.281
Our nuclear power plants
have multiple layers of security

12:20.364 --> 12:22.700
and a high level
of operational performance.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.911
Boy, I'm sure glad you showed up.
You seem to have all the answers.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.497
I love people who have all the answers.
Don't you, Judge?

12:28.581 --> 12:29.415
Uh--

12:30.416 --> 12:31.917
Of course, we've had
all the answers before.

12:32.001 --> 12:37.214
In 1925, the International Commission
on Radiological Protection

12:37.298 --> 12:41.051
set the radiation exposure
limit at 100 rem per year.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.263
Anything under it was safe.
We now know they were wrong.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.974
-Yes.
-And in 1934,

12:47.057 --> 12:50.102
the National Council
on Radiation Protection

12:50.186 --> 12:52.521
set the standard at 36 rem per year.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.941
Positive that was safe.
And we now know that's also way too high.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.611
In fact, the acceptable level of radiation

12:58.694 --> 13:00.821
keeps getting reduced
the more and more we learn.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.490
Good thing, I guess,
we now know everything.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.699
Wouldn't you agree?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.701
Nuclear power plants are safe.
I know that.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.454
Yes. Unless there's a design flaw,

13:08.704 --> 13:13.793
or human error, or unsafe procedures,
or a terrorist attack.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.836
-I try to deal with probabilities, not--
-Really?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.798
I lean towards certainty
when being even a tiny bit off

13:18.881 --> 13:20.758
could wipe out hundreds
of thousands of people.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.135
You want a certainty?
Global warming is killing us.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.430
-Unless we explore new ways--
-How about solar power?

13:26.514 --> 13:29.099
-That's good. But not enough.
-All right, all right, all right!

13:29.183 --> 13:30.643
I'd like to hear from Miss Michele,
please.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.646
Well, it's a good thing
I was almost finished.

13:36.690 --> 13:40.027
Um, Your Honor, would it be possible
for me to testify from here?

13:41.320 --> 13:42.154
Why?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.490
Well, this is very embarrassing,

13:44.573 --> 13:46.992
but, um, I would just feel
more comfortable

13:47.076 --> 13:48.619
with a little distance from you.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.498
I'm deeply attracted to you.
And my flirting can sometimes--

13:52.581 --> 13:55.000
Well, I don't want to do
anything that would make you

13:55.084 --> 13:57.378
think that I don't
take this case seriously.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.631
Shame.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.017
You need to tone it down.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.062
-Why? Was I inappropriate?
-Andrea.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.108
ANDREA: Ooh, there he is.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.861
I can't wait to be cross-examined by you.
Don't be gentle.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.571
-(laughs)
-Andrea.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.492
So, Jack, here to settle?

14:28.576 --> 14:30.828
You remember The Old Bailey
in Harvard Square?

14:30.911 --> 14:33.622
Gee, how could I?
We only ate there seven days a week.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.499
(giggles) It's still open.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.253
Hamburgers are rumored to be just as good.
What do you say?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.884
Carl. Uh, Jack and I were just talking
about grabbing a bite later.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.177
Remember The Old Bailey?
You want to join us?

14:48.095 --> 14:51.640
I'd love to. But, um, you two go ahead.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.183
You never said he was funny.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.060
(both chuckle awkwardly)

14:58.981 --> 15:02.526
So, Jack, can I see the photos
of these kids you keep bragging about?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.361
Well, it took you long enough.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.323
Ah, let's see.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.326
There's Steph, looks just like her mother.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.995
Oh, God. She's beautiful.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.873
Yeah, she is. And, uh, here's Michael.

15:16.790 --> 15:20.044
Also looks like Kim. Also beautiful.
I wonder if they're really mine.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.462
(laughing)

15:21.545 --> 15:23.213
I'm having trouble believing this.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.882
I promise you, Jerry.
I wouldn't make it up.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.216
"Watch your back."

15:26.300 --> 15:28.135
Her exact words.
She's a bit off, I'm afraid.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.137
I'll talk to her.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.722
Please don't head butt her.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.350
Is there any chance
you could've got it wrong?

15:34.433 --> 15:35.267
None.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.439
I'm all for saving the planet.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.441
But sorry, I don't feel like
getting cancer in the process.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.069
And do you have any evidence
that you would?

15:45.152 --> 15:46.737
Oh, come on. Radiation?

15:46.820 --> 15:48.781
Even this administration's
scientific commissions,

15:48.864 --> 15:51.200
which don't include
any scientists, I admit,

15:51.283 --> 15:53.202
say that there are risks,
and they're pro-nuke.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.162
Hello.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.875
And yet many environmentalists
are for them, are they not?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.211
Yeah, but I doubt
they want to live near them.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.879
And there's just as many
that are against them.

16:04.254 --> 16:06.548
By the way, and I don't
mean to get political here,

16:06.632 --> 16:07.549
how can our administration

16:07.633 --> 16:11.011
can claim on the one hand that there are
terrorists out there, be afraid,

16:11.095 --> 16:13.847
and on the other hand be pro-nuke
when it should be obvious to anyone

16:13.931 --> 16:16.892
that you build these plants,
you multiply by a thousand

16:16.976 --> 16:19.061
the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation?

16:19.687 --> 16:21.772
All right, just one weekend
on the Vineyard.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.315
Don't make me bark for it.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.738
Have you read the EPA's
report on nuclear power plants?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.699
The fix is in at the EPA.
Everybody knows that.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.451
Take that as a no. What about the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's report?

16:34.535 --> 16:35.703
I'm waiting for the movie to come out.

16:35.786 --> 16:38.205
How about the National Academy of Science?

16:38.288 --> 16:40.082
Sweetie, I'll be happy
to swap reading lists.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.126
Just fax 'em to me on the Vineyard,
I'll be with Judgie.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.253
In the meantime,
I don't care who writes what.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.131
I don't want a nuclear reactor
in my neighborhood.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.008
Do you?

16:57.349 --> 17:00.686
She makes for a good witness.
But, uh, we can't just go away.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.105
This is billions of dollars
of research and development.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.984
Just pick another locale,
far away from Andrea.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.445
Hm. Something tells me Andrea gets around.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.239
Besides, there is no other place.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.992
It's either too residential,
or commercial district, or it's a park.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.202
We tried a swamp.
It was protected as wetlands.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.872
There are 60 acres of nothing
in Belmont Falls.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.081
Why are you smiling at me?

17:21.790 --> 17:24.293
I'm just remembering
all our dreams in college,

17:24.376 --> 17:26.253
how idealistic we both were.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.212
(chuckles)

17:27.296 --> 17:28.839
-Now look at us.
-What?

17:29.506 --> 17:31.508
We're arguing cases
we both strongly believe in.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.344
Is there some law that it's wrong
to fight for principles

17:34.428 --> 17:36.722
and make a fortune while doing so?

17:37.431 --> 17:38.682
There must be.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.518
These burgers are just as good at least.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.145
Hey, we're just as good.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.355
Better.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.273
Seriously.

17:46.982 --> 17:50.944
Other than some minor physical
depreciation, we-- we think better.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.406
We have a maturity that gives
us perspective. We love better.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.117
We appreciate what's really important.
We're at our peak.

17:57.201 --> 18:01.288
Like autumn foliage,
just before all the leaves fall off.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.915
(chuckles)

18:05.709 --> 18:07.127
You have any regrets, Jack?

18:08.545 --> 18:11.090
Well, I was hoping you did,
being the one who left.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.385
You seem happy.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.306
These hamburgers
are just as good, aren't they?

18:30.651 --> 18:33.654
Am I getting my ass whipped?
Not that I don't like that.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.615
We have a tough case, Andrea.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.661
Also, I'm not entirely sure it helps

18:40.744 --> 18:44.164
for you to be inviting the judge
to the Vineyard.

18:44.748 --> 18:46.792
You're right. Let's you and I go.

18:52.840 --> 18:57.803
I have a close friend who's proposed...

18:59.138 --> 19:01.014
(sighs) ...a ridiculous idea.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.517
(chuckles)

19:04.643 --> 19:05.561
Swinging.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.480
It just sounds absurd.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.317
But I admit, I-I speak from ignorance

19:12.401 --> 19:14.403
-cause I've never done it before--
-Who's the friend?

19:18.282 --> 19:19.533
Uh, Denny Crane.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.994
He's a-a lawyer here.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.079
Is he now?

19:24.288 --> 19:26.999
Not that you would ever consider,
of course.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.125
My vine or yours?

19:30.460 --> 19:32.462
-Really?
-I shock you?

19:34.882 --> 19:37.676
Not yet, but I'm hoping.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.891
-SHIRLEY: Well, it's late.
-JACK: Mm-hm.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.726
SHIRLEY: I'm a little bit drunk.

19:46.143 --> 19:49.438
-And I have to be in court in the morning.
-I do, too, remember?

19:49.521 --> 19:53.734
No. You've been such a wallflower.
I forgot you were even on this case.

19:53.817 --> 19:54.651
(laughs)

19:58.030 --> 19:59.698
Does your wife know
you're out with me tonight?

20:01.283 --> 20:02.284
She does, actually.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.663
I'm too old and too smart
to lie about matters.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.505
Why are you looking at me like that?

20:18.217 --> 20:21.345
Well, sometimes I'm too old
and too smart to speak the truth.

20:27.017 --> 20:30.229
You still play the piano?
There's a piano over there.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.607
-You trying to get rid of me?
-I-- I am, actually.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.150
(both chuckle)

20:35.234 --> 20:37.569
Plus, I always loved hearing you sing.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.448
Okay, a song it is.

20:42.950 --> 20:43.784
(grunts)

20:46.370 --> 20:48.330
-Any requests?
-Scotch.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.539
(laughs)

20:53.919 --> 20:54.962

Uh, one second?

23:08.637 --> 23:10.138
Go get Alan, tell him we need to go.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.643
(sighs) Probably isn't the best time,

23:14.726 --> 23:19.231
but, um, I don't think it's working out.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.817
What isn't working out?

23:22.234 --> 23:25.445
Us. You, me-- us.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.365
I think maybe we should
take a little break.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.243
What-what happened?

23:31.326 --> 23:34.788
Nothing's happened.
I just-- We can talk more about it later.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.164
No, we'll talk about it now.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.919
I want an explanation, please.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.592
Look, Shirley, I adore you.
I think that you are a phenomenal woman.

23:47.676 --> 23:51.221
But you and I are simply not a match.

23:51.304 --> 23:54.266
-Let's just leave it at that.
-No, let's not leave it at that.

23:54.349 --> 23:57.561
-What's going on?
-I told you, I want out.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.274
Okay, you're fired.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.484
What? For what reason?

24:04.568 --> 24:07.529
I'll give you three. First, I am pissed.

24:07.612 --> 24:10.991
Second, the name of this firm
is Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt.

24:11.074 --> 24:14.411
And third, I am Schmidt. You're done.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.751
She denies it?

24:21.835 --> 24:25.255
She thinks you maybe misinterpreted it.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.841
Yes. What part of
"watch your back" did I get wrong?

24:27.924 --> 24:30.969
-Katie, is it possible--
-No, Jerry, it is not.

24:31.052 --> 24:34.431
You have to admit what you're suggesting
is totally outside of Leigh's character.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.558
What I'm suggesting?
So, you don't believe me now?

24:36.641 --> 24:39.728
No, it's not that I don't believe you.
It's just--

24:39.811 --> 24:42.814
-Just what then?
-(purrs)

24:45.025 --> 24:49.196
(clears throat) I think there's always
two sides to every story,

24:49.279 --> 24:51.281
and I'm wondering
if it's possible that the truth

24:51.364 --> 24:52.991
here lies somewhere in the middle.

24:53.074 --> 24:54.951
It doesn't. Your girlfriend's a psycho.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.164
Americans are big babies, Your Honor.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.460
I will not have you
attacking this fine country of mine

25:03.543 --> 25:05.712
as we try to spread democracy
around the world.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.589
Yeah, well, the reason we want
to give the world democracy

25:07.672 --> 25:09.633
is so we can get back their oil in return.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.052
But it's-it's game over, Judge.

25:12.135 --> 25:14.763
We can't depend on oil
from other countries anymore.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.389
I could say we should drill for our own.

25:16.473 --> 25:18.391
But-but folks
don't want to hear that either.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.393
Tear up our own soil? Forget it.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.811
But the problem with Americans is we...

25:22.312 --> 25:23.688
We don't want to make sacrifices.

25:24.147 --> 25:27.025
Well, we have to. And if we truly want

25:27.108 --> 25:29.361
to save the planet
to rely less on petroleum

25:29.444 --> 25:31.029
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

25:31.112 --> 25:34.783
we simply have to commit
to the nuclear power industry.

25:34.866 --> 25:38.286
Are there some risks involved?
Sure, like with everything.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.623
There are bigger risks
in building nuclear bombs,

25:41.706 --> 25:44.334
but we do so
because we consider them necessary.

25:44.417 --> 25:47.379
Well, power plants are more so.
And they're viable.

25:47.796 --> 25:51.633
We've already got 104 reactors
in 66 plants in the US,

25:51.716 --> 25:53.718
and we're not all dying of cancer.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.680
In fact, since power plants
don't burn fossil fuels

25:56.763 --> 25:59.182
and send carbon dioxide into the air,

25:59.266 --> 26:01.810
we'll probably have
less cancer as a result of them.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.688
But just because a few babies
saw <i>China Syndrome</i>

26:04.771 --> 26:07.315
or the word "Chernobyl"
pops up every now and again

26:07.399 --> 26:10.819
in the Sunday crossword,
we panic at the mention.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.862
Let's grow up.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.783
Nuclear power will save lives,
money, energy and the planet.

26:16.866 --> 26:20.078
Already they produce one-fifth
of America's electricity.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.747
In Vermont,
maybe our greenest state, it's 70%.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.458
Still need a reason?
How about this? We have no choice.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.461
Coal and oil supplies are being exhausted.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.923
One day they'll be gone.
We have no choice.

26:32.007 --> 26:35.760
Sure we do. There's solar energy,
hydroelectric power

26:35.844 --> 26:37.762
and of course, listening to Mr. Ross,

26:37.846 --> 26:40.682
one is reminded of the enormous
potential of wind.

26:40.765 --> 26:44.144
His closing argument alone I'm sure
could have fueled Hillary's electrolysis.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.688
By the way, she's willing
to explore nuclear power.

26:46.771 --> 26:50.066
As are Obama, Mitt, Rudy.
They all are, except Edwards.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.776
It's in now to be pro-nuke.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.362
<i>Elle</i> magazine says,
"nuclear power is cool."

26:54.446 --> 26:56.698
Am I the only one who's scared to death?

26:56.781 --> 26:59.492
The amount of radiation
we're talking about--

26:59.576 --> 27:02.495
I mean, my dentist still flees the room
when he X-rays my teeth.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.832
Any exposure is harmful.
Every scientist says so.

27:05.915 --> 27:09.669
Not even the gifted but gusty Mr. Ross
can dispute that.

27:09.753 --> 27:12.756
Radiation exposure causes cancer.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.258
Within the plume of Three Mile Island,

27:15.342 --> 27:19.387
there was a three
to 400% increase in lung cancer.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.891
A six to 700% increase in leukemia.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.977
Why the hell do you think they haven't
built one of these since the 1970s?

27:26.061 --> 27:29.022
And do we all feel safe
that nothing will go horribly wrong?

27:29.105 --> 27:30.732
With our leaders in charge?

27:30.815 --> 27:33.276
Where the hell is Condi
to talk about the big mushroom cloud

27:33.360 --> 27:34.194
when we need her?

27:34.903 --> 27:37.364
And if the next suicide hijacker

27:37.697 --> 27:40.617
instead of pointing it at a high-rise,
aims for a power plant,

27:40.700 --> 27:42.494
it's lights out, pun intended.

27:42.577 --> 27:45.664
Which is why these nukes are regarded
by many security analysts

27:45.747 --> 27:49.125
as sort of pre-positioned
weapons of mass destruction.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.543
And the reactors' container domes

27:50.627 --> 27:52.921
are built to withstand the impact
of a jetliner.

27:53.004 --> 27:57.509
Oh, balls! You don't need to be a genius
to know that a fully loaded jetliner

27:57.592 --> 27:59.594
would at least crack the damn thing.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.514
-Cause a massive radioactive--
-What are you? An engineer now?

28:02.597 --> 28:05.558
At least have the decency
to strap yourself to a polygraph

28:05.642 --> 28:07.310
so we know which lie is which--

28:07.394 --> 28:08.728
Silence!

28:11.272 --> 28:15.694
Mr. Shore, would you wrap it up,
please? And quickly.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.947
-One last thought, Judge.
-Thank God.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.199
I'm going to skip over the whole section

28:21.282 --> 28:24.202
I had on earthquakes
and proceed right to the waste.

28:24.285 --> 28:30.375
These facilities will produce
tons and tons and tons...

28:33.253 --> 28:36.756
(sighs) ...and tons and tons
of nuclear waste.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.716
Where should we store it?

28:37.799 --> 28:42.721
Already we have 55,000
metric tons of the crap

28:42.804 --> 28:45.140
with no real idea
of what the hell to do with it.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.434
Our best plan to date
is to just bury it somewhere.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.769
Pump the radioactive stuff
back into the earth

28:49.853 --> 28:52.355
until one day the entire planet
will be full of it!

28:54.566 --> 28:55.400
Like you.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.739
-All right, I shall rule--
-I lied. We know where it'll go.

29:00.822 --> 29:04.534
As other communities like Belmont Falls
hire lawyers to say, "Not in my backyard,"

29:04.617 --> 29:07.579
and the likes of the Sierra Club
keep it out of the deserts and parks,

29:07.662 --> 29:10.081
we know exactly
where the waste will eventually go.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.082
In the poor communities.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.711
Just like they get the power plants,
landfills, and fast-food restaurants.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.963
That's one of the wonderful
things about America.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.382
The poor always get what's coming to them.

29:36.274 --> 29:39.235
Katie, hello. Is Jerry around?

29:39.319 --> 29:43.281
He is, actually. He's under my desk
licking my thigh at the moment.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.367
That was dishonest of me, I apologize.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.537
I suppose it's not good
to be dishonest. Is it, Leigh?

29:50.538 --> 29:52.749
-I'm feeling hostility.
-Are you now?

29:53.333 --> 29:56.669
Jerry says you categorically deny
having told me to "watch my back."

29:57.962 --> 30:01.299
Katie, I'm not gonna get into
accusations over who said what.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.677
I was hoping you and I could be friends.

30:05.303 --> 30:09.224
Excellent. Um, how does one
define friendship in Leigh Swift terms?

30:10.141 --> 30:12.685
Well, I would define it...

30:13.603 --> 30:17.190
by you keeping your slutty,
well-traveled hands away from Jerry.

30:17.273 --> 30:21.361
I would define it by you
not sticking your big, sloppy,

30:21.444 --> 30:23.571
floppy breasts in his face.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.990
And if you keep looking at me like that,
I'll punch your lights out!

30:26.783 --> 30:29.160
Oh, want to run and tell now?

30:35.583 --> 30:38.127
He dumped you? Just like that?

30:38.878 --> 30:39.712
Yes.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.005
(Denny sighs)

30:43.925 --> 30:45.635
I don't want you to be alone tonight.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.470
-Damn it, Denny.
-Let me fill the void

30:47.554 --> 30:49.597
that I once gave so unselfishly to.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.267
You'll stay away from my void.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.441
Are you okay?

31:02.193 --> 31:06.197
I'm... I'm just shocked, I guess.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.492
Of all the childish...

31:11.119 --> 31:13.955
Shirley, we say childish
when it's really...

31:15.331 --> 31:17.083
just, uh, weak.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.043
Sounds like Carl...

31:21.004 --> 31:24.424
just can't handle
all that is Shirley Schmidt.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.807
Whatever you need, Shirley.
A shoulder, a hug, an erection.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.559
-Oh.
-Seriously.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.438
Whatever you need, I'm here.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.107
I know that, Denny.

31:42.817 --> 31:46.362
Which is the reason
yours is the office I came into.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.709
-Where's Alan?
-He's meeting us at the courthouse.

32:03.838 --> 32:05.965
Is there a cold draft in here or...

32:08.468 --> 32:11.679
Hello. What are you doing tonight?

32:11.763 --> 32:12.931
Whatever you have in mind.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.099
Whatever? No strings attached?

32:15.183 --> 32:19.145
Strings? No. Vines? Absolutely.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.203
I would like to know why.

32:39.749 --> 32:40.667
You and I...

32:43.127 --> 32:45.880
You want somebody to complement
your life, Shirley,

32:45.964 --> 32:48.549
as opposed to being part of it.

32:49.801 --> 32:55.098
The word "soul mate"
is as cliché as it is unrealistic.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.016
Or so I thought.

32:58.768 --> 33:02.313
-And--
-And I went to The Old Bailey.

33:03.690 --> 33:04.732
And I saw you two.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.695
What you had with Jack Ross,

33:09.821 --> 33:11.406
you may very well still have.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.491
You and I will never know.

33:19.288 --> 33:22.583
Carl, what you and I have--

33:22.667 --> 33:24.335
You deserve more.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.381
And so do I.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.519
If it's okay with you,

33:42.770 --> 33:44.856
I'm going to assume I'm not really fired.

34:06.878 --> 34:10.673
Leigh, hello. My, certainly seeing
a lot of you these days.

34:10.757 --> 34:15.428
You see? That was hostile.
I think she covets you, Jerry.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.639
-(purrs)
-Actually, I'm in a relationship, Leigh.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.892
I met the most wonderful,

34:20.975 --> 34:24.062
understanding and funny iPhone.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.482
So sleek and sexy, isn't it?

34:27.565 --> 34:30.526
-I wouldn't know.
-And look at the lines on it.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.029
You ever seen anything so sensuous?

34:34.614 --> 34:36.491
Hold it in your hand, Leigh. It's fab.

34:37.158 --> 34:40.119
She's trying to exploit
my disability, Jerry.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.497
What kind of a person is this?

34:42.580 --> 34:45.333
And the things you can download.
Check this out.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.461
KATIE (over phone): <i>How does one define</i>
<i>friendship in Leigh Swift terms?</i>

34:49.462 --> 34:52.090
LEIGH (over phone):
<i>Well, I would define it by you</i>

34:52.173 --> 34:55.676
<i>keeping your slutty,</i>
<i>well-traveled hands away from Jerry.</i>

34:55.760 --> 34:57.970
<i>I would define it</i>
<i>as you not sticking your big,</i>

34:58.054 --> 35:00.473

35:00.848 --> 35:03.726
<i>And if you keep looking at me like that,</i>
<i>I'll punch your lights out!</i>

35:06.521 --> 35:07.688
She tricked me.

35:08.439 --> 35:12.443
She's a conniving bitch, Jerry.
She tricked me!

35:12.527 --> 35:15.363
Leigh, I'm finding it
very difficult to believe you.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.329
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

35:24.997 --> 35:28.876
Why? Why must there be so many bad people?

35:41.222 --> 35:43.766
Obviously nuclear power plants pose risks.

35:44.183 --> 35:46.394
People in Illinois are having
big problems with them

35:46.477 --> 35:48.521
leaking radiated water into the ground.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.731
Wet dirt has also been found in New York.

35:50.815 --> 35:54.944
Why, somebody could get hold
of the waste and build a dirty bomb.

35:55.444 --> 35:58.030
But no one can say
for a certainty that we'd all be safe.

35:58.114 --> 36:02.326
But we can, as Mr. Bostick said,
"know for a certainty"

36:02.410 --> 36:05.371
that unless we do something
drastic about global warming,

36:05.454 --> 36:08.040
it won't be a mushroom cloud
that gets us in the end.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.336
But all of this is-is secondary

36:12.420 --> 36:15.756
to the fact that my mother
lives in Belmont Falls.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.675
-(grunts)
-The injunction is granted.

36:17.758 --> 36:20.094
And we're adjourned.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.473
Proving over and over again
the law knows no logic.

36:24.557 --> 36:27.476
-Okay, now I'm horny.
-Gee.

36:27.560 --> 36:31.189
-Unbelievable. Got milk?
-Uh, don't let me hold you two up.

36:33.733 --> 36:37.486
-Okay, that wasn't fair.
-Yeah.

36:37.570 --> 36:41.157
Life sometimes isn't.
Can I buy you a burger?

36:41.240 --> 36:46.162
Uh, it's my oldest son's birthday.
So, uh, I'd suggest a rain check,

36:46.245 --> 36:48.372
but I'm not sure that's a good idea.

36:49.415 --> 36:50.333
Probably not.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.920
If only life came with
a "do over," you know?

36:56.172 --> 36:57.965
-So good seeing you again.
-You, too.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.677
-Bye, Shirley.
-Bye.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.318
I may have to appeal.

37:17.401 --> 37:19.320
(chuckles)

37:19.403 --> 37:23.658
<i>♪ Oh, my, my ♪</i>

37:26.369 --> 37:30.039
<i>♪ So long ♪</i>

37:30.122 --> 37:33.251
<i>♪ So long, so long ♪</i>

37:42.009 --> 37:45.513
I have to admit it.
I'm a little nervous. Are you?

37:45.596 --> 37:48.683
Denny, I'm still a little...
unsure about this.

37:49.558 --> 37:53.688
I'm not gonna commit to anything
until your girl gets here.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.815
What are you talking about?
My girl is here.

37:57.233 --> 38:00.903
No, I mean the one for me.
The one you were with the other day.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.572
This is the one I was with the other day.

38:03.656 --> 38:06.117
-What? No. I-- What?
-What?

38:09.036 --> 38:10.121
Slutty me.

38:12.164 --> 38:14.583
-Wait a second.
-I don't believe this.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.588
So-so-- what I had
with you the other day--

38:20.047 --> 38:21.215
Denny's leftovers.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.721
-We can't swing with one.
-Why, of course we can.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.264
(Denny groans)

38:29.181 --> 38:31.475
I knew it was too good to be true.
There's no way.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.477
I mean, we had the Red Sox
and the Patriots

38:33.561 --> 38:36.022
and a little swap action
all in the same year?

38:36.105 --> 38:39.233
Boys, not to worry. I'm indefatigable.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.034
(music playing)

38:57.835 --> 39:01.630
I should've known better
than to expect a good hamburger in peace.

39:01.714 --> 39:02.882
(chuckles)

39:05.843 --> 39:06.719
Denny told me.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.263
Sorry.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.726
You know, Shirley,
maybe you and Jack Ross should--

39:13.809 --> 39:15.019
He's happily married.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.188
Oh.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.693
Nuclear power plants,
global warming, wars.

39:22.777 --> 39:26.113
They all seem quite trivial in the end
next to matters of the heart.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.532
-Are you guessing, Alan?
-(scoffs)

39:29.450 --> 39:32.453
I've known love. I may not play it well,

39:32.536 --> 39:34.705
but, as a varsity sport,

39:34.789 --> 39:38.042
but... I know love.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.254
I thought you and Denny
were swinging tonight.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.423
We were afraid her arms would get tired.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.674
(chuckles)

39:47.134 --> 39:48.177
That, and I--

39:48.260 --> 39:50.179
-Chicken.
-(chuckles)

39:51.806 --> 39:55.768
I know that Denny
said he was there for you.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.562
So am I.

40:00.856 --> 40:03.484
Thank you, Alan. I'm a big girl.

40:03.567 --> 40:04.402
Yes.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.530
I heard in a song somewhere they cry.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.198
Sometimes.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.244
Good night, Alan.

40:18.624 --> 40:21.085
<i>♪ And when I return again ♪</i>

40:21.168 --> 40:24.338
<i>♪ Have a great long story to tell ♪</i>

40:34.932 --> 40:36.392
DENNY:
At least you got a little cheek action.

40:36.475 --> 40:37.685
I walked away with nothing.

40:37.768 --> 40:42.148
Why? I left you with Andrea.
Nothing happened?

40:42.815 --> 40:46.819
I was too, uh... crestfallen.

40:46.902 --> 40:48.571
(chuckles)

40:48.654 --> 40:52.241
You know, maybe we should do,
a-a three-way.

40:52.324 --> 40:54.785
It's the one thing you
and I haven't shared together.

40:54.869 --> 40:58.289
(groans) Denny, I...
really don't think I can be...

40:59.081 --> 41:01.333
next to you in a bed
while you're naked and sweating,

41:01.417 --> 41:03.335
and that's as far
as I can take the imagery.

41:06.922 --> 41:10.634
I don't like the idea of you sneaking over
to see Shirley like that.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.471
She's vulnerable. I should be the one
that takes advantage of that.

41:13.554 --> 41:14.388
Not you.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.098
I think she's more than vulnerable.

41:17.183 --> 41:20.311
She might be a little... brokenhearted.

41:21.103 --> 41:23.647
Not over Carl Sack,

41:23.731 --> 41:26.484
but... what could have been
with Jack Ross.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.195
Ever notice how she goes
for guys with one-syllable names?

41:29.278 --> 41:31.447
Crane, Ross, Tiggs, Sack, Crane.

41:31.530 --> 41:34.241
-You said Crane twice.
-That's 'cause she's not over me.

41:35.618 --> 41:36.785
And never will be.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.458
We need to look out for her a little now.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.794
There's many things in life
that are paramount, but...

41:48.339 --> 41:50.299
being there for a friend in pain...

41:53.385 --> 41:55.804
I'm-I'm-I'm glad you
went and checked with her.

41:56.263 --> 41:59.058
Lovers come and go, but friends...

42:00.976 --> 42:03.521
not everybody has somebody like us.

42:04.104 --> 42:04.939
No.

42:07.733 --> 42:09.652
-Still want to swing, though.
-We'll swing.

42:09.985 --> 42:14.365
The thing about life, you always have
to keep something on the "to do" list.

42:16.617 --> 42:17.451
We'll swing.

42:19.495 --> 42:21.205
I don't like Shirley being
on your "to do" list.

42:21.288 --> 42:22.122
Will you get over it?

42:22.206 --> 42:23.624
-I'm just saying.
-Never mind.

42:32.508 --> 42:33.759
NARRATOR: <i>Next on</i> Boston Legal...

42:33.842 --> 42:37.638
I see you're charged with felony forgery,
and there appears to be ample evidence.

42:37.721 --> 42:39.348
-I'm dying.
-You don't look it.

42:39.431 --> 42:42.142
-I'd be glad to explain over dinner.
-Leo, I-I represent you.

42:42.226 --> 42:44.853
So, it would be extremely unethical
to kiss you.

42:44.937 --> 42:47.022
We're supposed to be able to save people.
You look like you need to be rescued.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.107
Hello.

42:49.024 --> 42:49.858
Coast Guard training.

42:50.359 --> 42:52.486
Andrea, hi, my friends call me the Beav.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.821
What is it today, Beav?

42:53.904 --> 42:55.114
I don't want to have sex.

42:55.197 --> 42:57.616
But you were so good, Chuckles.
You earned it.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.493
Ooh, look, we're alone.

42:59.785 --> 43:02.496
You need somebody like me.
You know you do.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.001
