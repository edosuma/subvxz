00:08.680 --> 00:09.760
[both] Hi.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.120
You've just seen
a typical morning in the life of Wham!,

00:12.200 --> 00:14.080
but things haven't really… [splutters]

00:14.160 --> 00:15.840
Once again. Can we do it again?

[both] Hi.

You've just seen
a typical morning in the life of Wham!.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.520
Things haven't always been
this way for us.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.920
This is Bushey Meads School, where we met
at the tender age of 12 in 1975.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.320
We have with us today

00:29.400 --> 00:31.160
a very special guest.

00:31.240 --> 00:35.160
Mr. Ted Halliwell, my old headmaster.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.240
Ted, how are you?

00:38.120 --> 00:39.200
Never been better.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.920
Good. Ted, tell me, did you ever think
things would turn out like this?

00:44.640 --> 00:47.040
-Well…
-Thank you, Ted. Let's go to George.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.320
[George] When I was with Andrew,

00:49.840 --> 00:52.960
we were absolutely determined
to have a fantastic time.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.200
-[Andrew] Wham! was a brotherhood.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.560

[George] A human, unpredictable mess.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.440
All of it was pop.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.920
[Andrew] And Wham! was

01:07.880 --> 01:09.560
[George] It was like a dream, really,

01:09.640 --> 01:11.480
since we were kids.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.560
But at the time,

01:15.320 --> 01:16.720
everyone's like,

[interviewer] George, can you just tell us
how you and Andrew got together?

02:29.920 --> 02:33.520
Uh, basically, we met when I was 11
and Andrew was 12

02:33.600 --> 02:35.160
in North London.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.360
The first day

02:40.200 --> 02:42.720
that I got to my new school, I met Andrew.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.240
Our form tutor walked in with a new boy.

02:49.160 --> 02:52.240
He had these sodding
great big window-frame glasses.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.920
[George] And I was very awkward.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.160
Slightly porky,
very strange-looking bloke.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.440
[Andrew] Very curly big bonce of hair.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.920
[George] And quite shy.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.400
[Andrew] Our teacher introduced him
as Georgios Panayiotou.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.320
[George] Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou,
that's it.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.840
[Andrew] "Who's going to
look after the new boy?"

03:12.520 --> 03:14.200
[George] Andrew put up his hand.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.960
I genuinely believe that
there's something predestined about it.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.320
I mean, the path
might have been totally different

03:21.400 --> 03:24.040
had I sat down
next to someone else that day.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.960
[Andrew] For me, he was Yog.
It was the nickname I'd given him.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.640
[George] There was such a bond there,
really.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.160
[Andrew] Essentially, Yog and I saw things
exactly the same way.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.880
Musically, we were joined at the hip.

03:39.800 --> 03:45.000
We'd spend hours doing skits
and putting together comedy radio shows.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.520
…writing songs, and then we started a band
when we were both about 16.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.720
[Andrew] We were the Executive.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.200
[recording] Uh, the Executive.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.720
One, two, three, four,

03:55.800 --> 03:59.520
[ska version of "Für Elise" playing]

03:59.600 --> 04:00.960
[George] It was ska music,

04:01.760 --> 04:04.280
and we were terrible, basically! [laughs]

04:04.800 --> 04:06.960
[Andrew] Uh, we weren't bad for 16.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.160
[music stops abruptly]

04:08.240 --> 04:10.120
[Andrew] Okay, wankers, third time!

04:10.200 --> 04:11.280
[ska music continues]

04:11.360 --> 04:15.320
[Andrew] The five of us just about covered
everything that we needed instrument-wise.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.760
[George] Come back, Andrew!

04:16.840 --> 04:18.360
Fizzled out after a year,

04:18.440 --> 04:22.200
as people didn't turn up for practices
or concerts or whatever.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.440
[Andrew] I wouldn't say it fizzled out.

04:24.520 --> 04:28.000
It rather more imploded,
and that just left me and Yog.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.400
[George] It was just gonna be us two.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.200
[Andrew] And we would just carry on
writing songs together.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.480
[Andrew] And we'd go out dancing
in London's West End.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.280
[George] And we went to a club
called the Beat Route.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.240
We were kinda doing
this, like, formation dance

04:52.320 --> 04:53.280
and having a laugh.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.840
Andy started shouting something
about "wham, bam" and all this, you know?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.640
[Andrew] So I just started rapping,

04:59.720 --> 05:01.920
"Wham, bam, I am the man."

05:02.520 --> 05:04.600
We thought
that'd be a good name for a group.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.480
Wham!.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.040

05:20.240 --> 05:24.320
[George] Andrew and I had developed
a knack for writing these catchy songs.

05:24.840 --> 05:28.560
We did a demo tape for £20
in Andrew's front room.

05:29.640 --> 05:32.720
We had, like,
a broom with a microphone tied to it

05:32.800 --> 05:36.160

those little four-track portastudios

05:36.240 --> 05:38.480

over the table and said,

but go away and write some hit songs."

They all sent "Careless Whisper" away.
They all sent "Club Tropicana" away.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.920

08:24.440 --> 08:27.080
I was absolutely devastated.

Devastated.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.360
[Andrew] It was discouraging,

08:31.440 --> 08:36.480
but I knew a chap called Mark Dean,
who lived down the road from my parents,

08:36.560 --> 08:38.600
and he was in the record industry.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.680

Soft Cell and ABC.

saying, "Would you listen to a tape?"

08:45.880 --> 08:48.320
And, uh, I wouldn't.

"Oh, not another band next door."

There was no music on the tape.

But it didn't even make the top 100.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.320
It was a disaster.

12:09.960 --> 12:14.960
The record company felt
that we would need to build up a fan base.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.760
They proposed
that we did personal appearances

12:17.840 --> 12:21.200
in these small clubs
up and down the length of the country.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.760
Yes, George is gonna do a bit of rapping.

[George] And even though
it was embarrassing

12:45.200 --> 12:48.320
and you were constantly being
harassed by drunks and shit,

12:48.400 --> 12:50.400
it meant that we were prepared.
You know what I mean?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.120
I'm gonna ask you to sing along
to some of this.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.800
[Andrew] We were
under massive pressure to chart,

12:59.880 --> 13:02.360
and George came up with "Young Guns."

13:02.440 --> 13:05.200
If "Young Guns" wasn't a hit,
we would be dropped.

made its way up the charts to number 72.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.720
[George] "Wham Rap!" had been a failure.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.760
[Andrew] If this track wasn't a hit,
we weren't gonna make another record,

13:28.280 --> 13:30.280
and it stalled at number 42.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.080
It wasn't actually gonna make it
into the top 40.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.200
[George] And that was possibly
the worst week of my life.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.280
Christ's sake, you know? It felt bad.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.040
I spent a week thinking,

13:43.840 --> 13:45.520
"I'm not any good at this."

13:46.280 --> 13:47.960
That I was wrong about something

13:48.040 --> 13:51.040
that I believed with all my heart
since I was a child.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.080
And then we got
this miracle phone call out of the blue.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.960
[Andrew] We get a phone call
from Top of the Pops,

14:04.040 --> 14:08.200
asking us if we will appear
because another artist had dropped out.

14:08.920 --> 14:12.120
The only prime-time chart show.

14:12.720 --> 14:17.520
I'd never really seen stardom
above Top of the Pops, you know?

14:19.320 --> 14:21.320
A Top of the Pops appearance was

14:22.520 --> 14:23.840
the holy grail.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.480
[George] The night before,
we stayed in this little hotel.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.080
[Andrew] George drew the short straw
and got some crib to sleep in.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.040
[George] And it was a child-size bed.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.200
[Andrew] He had
a really uncomfortable, sleepless night

"Wham! will shape the views

22:36.920 --> 22:39.560
you know,
made my attraction to men fairly clear.

22:40.120 --> 22:43.560
I had stayed over at this guy's house.

22:44.160 --> 22:47.000
He tried to have sex with me,
and I'd been too scared.

22:47.600 --> 22:52.480
But I realized that I wanted to stay
in the bed for the night.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.560
I wanted to be close to this guy,

22:55.080 --> 22:56.760
which had never happened before.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.480
And I wrote a song about that.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.440
That's what that song was about.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.960
♪ I watch you breathe ♪

23:05.040 --> 23:07.280
♪ I cannot sleep… ♪

23:07.360 --> 23:10.400
[George] It kinda hit me
really in a very kind of profound way

23:10.480 --> 23:12.240
that something else was going on.

23:13.920 --> 23:17.440
Once I realized that this was
a part of my sexuality I couldn't ignore,

23:17.520 --> 23:20.640
I went to come out to Andrew.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.360
[Andrew] For me,

23:24.200 --> 23:28.400
his sexuality had
absolutely no bearing on… on us.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.840
I wanted him to be happy.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.920
[George] I said I was gonna talk to
my mum and dad and was persuaded,

23:37.000 --> 23:40.440
in no uncertain terms,
that it really wasn't the best idea.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.280
I don't think they were trying to protect
my career or their careers.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.680
I think they were literally
just thinking of my dad. [laughs]

23:48.760 --> 23:50.600
'Cause when you're 19, that's as far as…

23:50.680 --> 23:52.960
You look at your parents.
"Don't tell your dad."

23:53.040 --> 23:54.840
"My God, your dad'll hit the roof."

23:54.920 --> 23:59.120
[Andrew] We… We… We felt, you know,
that he just couldn't tell his dad.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.560
[George] The three of us
were so close at the time,

24:04.080 --> 24:07.720
but the point being
I'd really, really asked the wrong people.

24:08.680 --> 24:13.320
[Andrew] I mean, you know,
we were 19, 20 years old.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.800
Our perspective was a little narrower.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.760
[George] That is a pivotal moment.

24:21.280 --> 24:25.080
At that point in time, I really did.
I really wanted to come out.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.680
And then I lost my nerve completely.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.920
And just… [sighs]

24:34.000 --> 24:35.560
…by necessity,

24:36.280 --> 24:39.800
I went with full gusto
into the progression of Wham!,

24:42.040 --> 24:44.640
creating a new character.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.280
You're gonna do better and better
and shock everyone at how well you can do.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.680
Forging an identity through my success.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.560
[Andrew] George's songwriting
was developing

25:05.640 --> 25:09.080
at an amazing, inconceivable sort of pace.

25:09.160 --> 25:13.600
My songwriting just wasn't developing
in anything like the same way his was,

25:14.160 --> 25:16.640
and it created a little bit of friction.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.520
Through the album,

25:19.040 --> 25:22.840
through recording Fantastic,
we'd… we'd had a discussion.

25:23.600 --> 25:27.040
[George] And we talked about the fact
that if we wanted to be massive,

25:27.120 --> 25:28.720
we shouldn't share the writing.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.680
[Andrew] The goals
that we kind of set ourselves

25:31.760 --> 25:33.680
could only be attained, really,

25:33.760 --> 25:37.720
with the sort of quality of songwriting
that he was able to produce.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.680
[George] I've always seen the writing
as the gift I was meant to protect.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.680
Never been any question about that.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.560
[Andrew] It was uncomfortable for me

25:46.640 --> 25:50.040
because songwriting was something that I…

25:50.120 --> 25:51.720
really, how we started.

25:51.800 --> 25:56.360
We formed a band so we could write songs,
so it was a little difficult.

25:58.160 --> 26:01.240
[George] Andrew and I have
got it out the way very quickly

26:02.680 --> 26:04.680
and never had to discuss it again.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.960
["Wham Rap!" playing]

26:14.640 --> 26:17.040
Your album, quite seriously,
it was a great album

26:17.120 --> 26:18.760
'cause there's not one bad track on it.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.400
-A terrific album.
-Thank you very much.

26:21.160 --> 26:24.040
[Andrew] Our debut album Fantastic
had got to number one.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.600
[George] It was an amazing thing to see.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.720
[Andrew] It remained in the charts
for the best part of two and a half years.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.280
Fancy a bit of Wham!?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.800
-Yes.
-I thought you'd say that.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.800
[Andrew] However, the music press
didn't like "Club Tropicana" at all.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.080
They resented
that we had thrown the shackles off.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.400
It wasn't another protest song.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.680
I wasn't too keen on
the "Casablanca" single or whatever, but…

26:52.760 --> 26:55.600
-[host] "Club Tropicana."
-I knew it was one of those places.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.920
[Andrew] "Withering,
contemptuous, complete sell-out."

27:00.600 --> 27:03.360
When your first singles came out,
you had a mixed following,

27:03.440 --> 27:05.680
so you seem to have now
what we've got round here,

27:05.760 --> 27:08.920
which is a lot of young girls
madly in love with you.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.480
Is it a change of image?
It looks that way.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.000
We started off
with mainly a club audience,

27:14.080 --> 27:17.120
a lot of girls and blokes of our own age.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.400
And, uh, this year,
we've been in a lot of national press,

27:20.480 --> 27:22.480
and we've been in a lot of girl magazines.

27:22.560 --> 27:26.120
-[host] That's a choice of your own.
-Yeah, it's a choice of our own.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.000
[Andrew] It narked George

27:28.880 --> 27:32.160
because people
weren't taking him seriously

27:32.240 --> 27:33.280
as a songwriter.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.280
-George and Andrew from Wham!.
-Morning!

27:36.360 --> 27:38.240
[host] A giant banana going to…

27:38.320 --> 27:40.320
Hugo Buckley, aged eight.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.480
-Poynton, Cheshire.
-[host] Right, great.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.600
[George] As a younger man
and as a younger songwriter

27:46.680 --> 27:49.920
trying to do my best,
those things really did hurt me.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.560
[Andrew] Despite the music press,

27:54.680 --> 27:58.320
we understood
that we were actually moving forwards.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.320
"Pop" became a very dirty word in England
for a good four or five years.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.280
We believe strongly in pop music
as very valid,

28:07.360 --> 28:09.600
and I think people lost sight of that.

28:11.240 --> 28:15.400
[Andrew] A genuine live nationwide tour
was our chance

28:15.480 --> 28:16.840
to prove the doubters wrong.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.440
Lovely T-shirt!

28:19.760 --> 28:22.720
Is there no chance
of cross-fading them with music?

28:23.240 --> 28:24.720
[Andrew] If it was gonna be a success,

28:24.800 --> 28:28.200
the Club Fantastic tour
had to be absolutely spot on.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.040
We never get what we want
unless we direct it fairly much ourselves.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.320
Before, it was, "It's a great idea, boys."

28:34.400 --> 28:36.120
[George] "What do you know? You're 19."

28:36.200 --> 28:38.840
"You'd never know
what you're talking about."

28:38.920 --> 28:41.200
-There are certain basic…
-That was a year ago.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.800
…basic rules to presenting yourself
that you know automatically,

28:44.880 --> 28:47.200
and we've actually
got that across to people now.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.040
[Andrew] This is an example.
Our own handiwork.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.080
It's the program for the tour.

28:53.120 --> 28:57.720
[George] I was supremely aware
that if I left the imagery to Andrew,

28:57.800 --> 28:59.320
kids kinda loved it.

29:01.320 --> 29:05.200
[Andrew] The outfits in the show
had to represent exuberance of youth,

29:05.280 --> 29:07.320
fun and excitement.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.040
[George] I'd admired Andrew
since we were kids,

29:10.120 --> 29:12.120
his kind of sense of style.

29:12.760 --> 29:16.400
I place a lot of that with him, you know?

29:16.480 --> 29:18.720
[Andrew] So I pushed the sportswear look.

29:19.680 --> 29:22.880
I chose red, and for some…

29:22.960 --> 29:25.120
probably 'cause he was colorblind…
[chuckles]

29:25.200 --> 29:27.520
…Yog chose canary yellow.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.400
We'd been joined by a new singer,

29:32.480 --> 29:34.840
Helen DeMacque, who we knew as Pepsi.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.400
She just slotted in beautifully

29:37.480 --> 29:40.200
and was a huge asset to us,
as was Shirlie.

29:40.280 --> 29:43.360
They added glamour
and a different kind of energy.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.480
There's no… There's nobody…

29:44.560 --> 29:47.120
It was weeks and weeks and weeks
of rehearsal.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.640
George being George,

29:49.440 --> 29:50.840
it was about detail.

29:51.560 --> 29:54.680
And in George's case, forensic detail.

29:58.680 --> 30:02.280
So much of how he defined himself
was wrapped up in his music.

30:04.320 --> 30:07.600
[George] And I went from being
Andrew's kind of shadow

30:08.520 --> 30:11.040

[Andrew] We had a number-one album.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.200
["Good Times" playing]

34:49.280 --> 34:51.200
The tour was an absolute triumph.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.440
Somebody! Anybody! Everybody!

34:53.520 --> 34:56.040
[Andrew] The press interest
was off the scale.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.800
Absolutely amazing. Absolutely brilliant.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.040
[Andrew] We had a string of hit singles.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.840
[crowd screaming]

35:08.000 --> 35:08.960
[Andrew] And we had

35:09.800 --> 35:11.040
zero money.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.400
[George] Andrew and I
both came home off tour

35:18.480 --> 35:22.120
and would go home to Mum and Dad.
It was literally that bad.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.880
[interviewer] Have you made
a lot of money?

35:23.960 --> 35:25.120
Um…

35:25.200 --> 35:29.960
No, not really, and what money we've made,
we probably won't get to see

35:30.040 --> 35:32.720
because it gets spent
before you get to see it.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.840
Um…

35:33.920 --> 35:36.560
There are reasons why we haven't made
anything like as much money

35:36.640 --> 35:38.720
as most people would probably believe,

35:38.800 --> 35:39.920
but, you know…

35:40.000 --> 35:42.640
You're well on the way to success.
Is money coming in?

35:43.160 --> 35:44.360
Ask my mum. She's out there.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.560
-[host] Is she here?
-Yes.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.680
-[host] You bought things?
-I bought a jumper.

35:47.760 --> 35:48.640
[laughter]

35:48.720 --> 35:51.760
-It cost nearly as much as the car.
-Lavish. We're really lavish.

35:52.840 --> 35:55.120
[George] It was absolutely ludicrous.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.480
[Andrew] We received 4% apiece
on singles in the UK

35:58.560 --> 36:00.280
and 2% in the rest of the world.

36:00.360 --> 36:03.320
[George] Right.
We didn't get any money on 12 inches,

36:03.400 --> 36:05.560
which is what, principally,
were selling at the time.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.600
I mean, the whole thing was laughable.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.560
[Mark] When they first come
to the record company,

36:09.640 --> 36:12.480
all they want is fame. Money, secondary.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.120
And suddenly they make it,

36:14.200 --> 36:16.920
and six months later,
they're still sitting on the bus,

36:17.000 --> 36:20.120
saying, "Shouldn't we have some money
for doing this as well?"

36:20.200 --> 36:22.200
"Why is it held up in pipeline royalties?"

36:22.280 --> 36:25.520
"Why is it here?" "Why is it there?"
That's when the trouble begins.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.800
[George] Two 18-year-old boys
being taken to a greasy spoon.

36:29.880 --> 36:33.760
The issue is,
was it fair on the day it was signed?

36:34.360 --> 36:36.240
How can you call being told

36:36.320 --> 36:38.840
that they're not gonna have
their big chance at stardom

36:38.920 --> 36:40.760
if they don't sign this piece of paper…

36:40.840 --> 36:42.280
How is that fair?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
[Andrew] We needed management.

36:46.960 --> 36:50.200
Now, I've got this book here,
You Don't Have To Say You Love Me,

36:50.280 --> 36:52.360
and it was written by Simon Napier-Bell,

36:52.440 --> 36:54.120
who's actually here with me.

36:57.040 --> 37:00.360
[George] In the '60s,
Simon was a bit of a Svengali.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.800
[Andrew] I really took to Simon.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.720
[Simon] On Top of the Pops,
they projected themselves

37:06.800 --> 37:10.480
in a way which no other group from
Top of the Pops I'd ever seen had done.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.480
Both as a group, in that they understood

37:12.560 --> 37:14.960
how to use Top of the Pops
to project themselves,

37:15.040 --> 37:19.200
and they came across with
this incredible sort of erotic intimacy.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.040
Anyone we met
had to give us that confidence,

37:22.120 --> 37:24.240
and no one had until Simon.

37:25.080 --> 37:29.720
[Andrew] And so a new deal
was signed directly with CBS.

[Andrew] It was around that point

37:45.160 --> 37:47.200
just what to do with "Careless Whisper."

37:48.880 --> 37:53.200
So George went to Muscle Shoals Studio
in Alabama.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.360
[George] I had to record it
with Jerry Wexler,

37:57.440 --> 38:00.960
Aretha Franklin's producer
and Ray Charles' producer,

38:01.480 --> 38:05.600
and his session guys, who are called
the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section,

38:05.680 --> 38:08.760
and they had
the most stunning repertoire of work.

38:26.480 --> 38:30.120
[George] I would stand there,
ready to do my "I feel so unsure,"

38:30.200 --> 38:32.120

38:32.200 --> 38:33.040
[Jerry] Stand by.

[Andrew] I was really keen to hear
what had been done with the track

38:53.800 --> 38:57.480
because we'd cowritten it together,
and we knew what it should sound like.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.560
[George] I thought,
"It's got Jerry Wexler's name on it."

39:00.640 --> 39:02.000

It was mostly down to me.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.240
[Andrew] When he took the decision
to record "Careless Whisper"

39:50.320 --> 39:52.320
the way that he wanted it to sound,

39:52.920 --> 39:56.800
George went through ten sax players…

39:56.880 --> 39:59.000
[saxophone playing]

where he'd produced a track
solely to his vision.

40:19.520 --> 40:23.960
[George] Yes, I had also produced
a catchy song.

40:28.680 --> 40:29.760

40:30.640 --> 40:32.640

staying in the spare bedroom,

40:37.840 --> 40:41.920

on my bedroom door,

"Wake me up up before you go,"

43:29.360 --> 43:31.840

43:32.400 --> 43:36.000
The decision was taken to record it
in the South of France.

43:37.560 --> 43:40.880
[George] Our label was like,
"You've gotta produce it yourself,"

43:40.960 --> 43:44.280
whereas on the first one, I hadn't been
allowed to do it myself. You know?

43:47.960 --> 43:51.920
[Andrew] Château Miraval was
an excellent creative environment

43:52.000 --> 43:53.080
in which to work.

43:54.360 --> 43:59.480
George liked to write almost exclusively
as part of the recording process.

44:00.680 --> 44:03.720
[George] Into my most private place,

44:03.800 --> 44:06.440
which is really being in the studio.

44:08.560 --> 44:13.840
I'm a producer
before I'm a singer sometimes.

44:13.920 --> 44:18.040
Andy's guitar is on 10, really,
and Hugh's is on 11.

44:18.120 --> 44:20.120
I construct what I do

44:20.200 --> 44:23.680
and literally work for hours
and hours and hours.

44:24.720 --> 44:27.680
[Andrew] My contribution
to the writing and recording

44:27.760 --> 44:29.800
was now limited to the recording.

44:30.760 --> 44:33.560
Whilst we had taken that decision,

44:33.640 --> 44:35.600
it was… it was slightly difficult.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.000
[whooping]

44:38.080 --> 44:42.520
[Andrew] But it was a sacrifice
that I felt I had to make.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.920
[Simon] Contrary to what people say,
that Andrew had no part in Wham!,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.320
it was totally the opposite.
Wham! was Andrew.

44:51.480 --> 44:54.040
And George, when he was younger,
copied Andrew.

44:54.640 --> 44:58.080
It was Andrew and Andrew,
the real Andrew and the fake one.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.920
But as time went on, I think George,

45:01.000 --> 45:04.240
partly because he really did feel
that the group wasn't him,

45:04.320 --> 45:07.280
uh… he put more and more effort
into the songwriting and production,

45:07.360 --> 45:10.040
and Andrew was
reasonably indifferent to that

45:10.120 --> 45:12.720
and was an easy-going person,
so he let George do it.

45:13.720 --> 45:14.920
[Andrew] By this point,

45:15.640 --> 45:18.560
we could see that his songwriting
was taking him in a direction

45:18.640 --> 45:20.320
that was different from mine.

45:21.080 --> 45:22.640
But he was my best friend,

45:23.160 --> 45:28.000
and to be a part of that evolution
would be a great thing.

45:30.160 --> 45:32.920
I don't think
George really recognized his own talent

45:33.000 --> 45:35.360
until two, three years ago.

45:35.960 --> 45:38.880
I don't think he was fully aware
of what he could achieve,

45:39.680 --> 45:41.960
and, I mean, he's grown in confidence

45:43.200 --> 45:44.200
so much.

but you hadn't spotted where it was yet.

46:11.720 --> 46:14.040
It's almost like
it comes to you fully formed,

46:14.640 --> 46:17.320
and you just pulled it out of nowhere.

46:18.120 --> 46:21.080
And the feeling that you have
that makes you shiver

46:21.160 --> 46:24.000
is that you found it.

[Andrew] Yog was very certain

46:38.920 --> 46:41.240
My life was a bit more straightforward.

46:41.920 --> 46:43.520
I was living in the moment.

46:44.280 --> 46:46.280
George let me take my bib off tonight.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.520
[laughter]

46:48.600 --> 46:53.200
I never felt that our music defined me
in the same way that it did for George.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.840
His songwriting was becoming the vehicle

46:55.920 --> 46:59.920
through which he could draw out
the person he wanted to be.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.520
I knew exactly who I was.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.240
[George] If you think about
what I was trying to do,

47:07.320 --> 47:10.480
as long as I was proud of the songs,
that was my goal.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.760
[Andrew] George was very sure of himself
when it came to making music,

47:15.840 --> 47:20.120
but he was less certain
in the personal aspect of his life.

47:21.840 --> 47:26.200
"Freedom" was the first track
Yog played to me as it was being recorded.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.960
[music fades]

47:50.040 --> 47:51.560
[George] As a young gay man,

47:52.360 --> 47:55.040
I knew I was just uncomfortable
'cause I was closeted.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.880
And then I was still kidding myself
that I was bisexual.

48:02.160 --> 48:05.840
Hang on to the little part of myself
that was attracted to women.

48:06.440 --> 48:08.000
At that point, you know,

48:08.680 --> 48:10.080

48:10.160 --> 48:11.320

48:15.160 --> 48:17.560
you're not gonna make life
difficult for yourself, are you?

48:21.440 --> 48:24.240
I was too young and too immature

48:24.320 --> 48:27.000
to know that I was sacrificing
as much as I was.

48:28.800 --> 48:32.120
[Andrew] As a young man
who was still trying to find himself,

48:33.040 --> 48:35.320
I knew Yog had lacked confidence.

48:37.040 --> 48:40.480
But I was unaware of just how deep-seated
the issues really were.

48:43.600 --> 48:48.680
[George] I have a memory
of that feeling of insecurity

48:50.360 --> 48:51.400
as a child.

48:55.320 --> 49:00.320
And the kind of scared teenager I was
felt very vulnerable.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.480
I mean, for many years,

49:03.320 --> 49:06.520
my support system was Andrew.

49:08.400 --> 49:09.880
[Andrew] I was self-assured.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.080
One school report
cited me as "disruptive."

49:15.640 --> 49:18.240
Andrew, a very sort of confident boy.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.960
A very cocky boy, you know.

49:20.680 --> 49:22.600
George was a quiet boy.

49:22.680 --> 49:24.320
Andrew was a leader.

49:25.800 --> 49:28.760
[Andrew] Our fathers
both came from abroad.

49:28.840 --> 49:32.520
My dad's family were from Egypt.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.640
[George] My father was from Cyprus.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.760
My father's father was a shepherd.

49:37.400 --> 49:42.440
And my father worked his arse off
and reaped the rewards.

49:43.080 --> 49:46.320
[Andrew] Jack viewed me
with a fair degree of skepticism.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.160
[George] My mum and dad thought
Andrew was the worst thing

49:49.240 --> 49:51.040
that could ever have happened to me.

49:52.040 --> 49:55.440
[Andrew] I'd visit his house,
rifle through the record collection.

49:55.520 --> 49:57.360
["Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" playing]

49:57.440 --> 50:00.280
[George] We talked about Elton's album
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.

50:00.360 --> 50:03.360
[Andrew] One of the albums
upon which our friendship was built.

50:03.880 --> 50:05.680
[George] We became firm friends.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.960
[Andrew] By about the age of 14,

50:11.040 --> 50:15.280
I'd completely lost any interest
in education, such as it was.

50:15.360 --> 50:19.560
[George] And I had this idea that,
"Well, you get your A-levels,

50:19.640 --> 50:21.920
then you do a job for a while."

50:22.640 --> 50:23.680
[Andrew] No.

50:23.760 --> 50:27.040
All I could think about
was being in a band with George.

50:27.680 --> 50:30.480
[George] Andrew had been
quite an influence on me.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.320
[Andrew] He felt the pressure
from his mum and dad

50:33.400 --> 50:35.760
far more acutely than I did from mine.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.800
[George] I came from
a very oppressive household.

50:39.400 --> 50:42.760
Because being the domineering father
I have been or I am,

50:42.840 --> 50:44.960
I wanted to dictate terms with him.

50:45.720 --> 50:50.160
[George] My father's idea was obviously
for me to have an academic career.

50:50.240 --> 50:52.800
I wanted him to become
a doctor, an accountant.

50:52.880 --> 50:55.800
Behave like I expect you to behave,
you know?

50:56.560 --> 50:58.560
I said, "You couldn't sing
to save your life anyway."

50:59.520 --> 51:02.000
[George] My father banned me
from using the stereo

51:02.080 --> 51:03.840
and banned me from buying records.

51:03.920 --> 51:06.640
He was obviously gonna make me
stop wasting my time

51:06.720 --> 51:08.640
on dreams of the music business.

51:08.720 --> 51:12.480
[Andrew] I phoned up Yog and said,
"Look, we're forming a band now."

51:12.560 --> 51:15.960
"No, no, I don't think I can.
I don't think we can."

51:16.800 --> 51:19.040
I provided the sort of thrust.

51:19.120 --> 51:22.000
He… He reluctantly agreed.

51:22.920 --> 51:25.720
[George] Andrew was this kind of idol
that I had.

51:25.800 --> 51:28.360
He was the first person
that I'd ever hung around with

51:28.440 --> 51:32.440
that was much stronger than me.
Almost everything came from Andrew.

51:34.440 --> 51:39.040
Andrew changed my life in exactly the way
someone needed to change my life

it didn't confirm us
as a big artist in the States,

a whole lot of work still to do.

55:44.040 --> 55:48.160
And everyone still wanted to know
really who we were.

55:49.440 --> 55:52.120
And, of course,
they wanted to know about the girls.

55:52.200 --> 55:54.400
You probably have

George is the blond,

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.440

I say this

Everybody's so excited

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.360
Andrew, he's just really never been called
a brunette here.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.360
-Oh. [laughs]
-That's very flattering, Phyllis.

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.720
[reporter] Why do you think
that they allowed Wham! to perform there?

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:35.720
I think they see us as fairly safe

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.280
because we don't really represent
rock and roll.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.760
We represent more, you know…
I don't know, show business, pop,

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.360
but the videos and the records,

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.440
which, after all,
is all they know about us,

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.720

You're saying because of your clean cut,

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.640
Yeah. Onstage, anyway.

What are you like offstage?

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.720

I was intelligent enough

If I was looking for happiness,

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:16.040

[Andrew] The character

[George] I wanna be able

[Andrew] His future as a solo artist

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.680
was dependent on Wham!
becoming as successful

as the likes of Prince or Elton.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.360
[George] I don't think there's any way
I could've controlled my ego enough

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.360

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.920

it's the biggest thing in the whole world?

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.960
I think the, um…

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:35.560
the success in America over the last year,
although we've worked very hard for it,

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.520
I think it's actually been
the biggest surprise,

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.480
the actual speed of success,
that we've come across

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.440
during the three years
we've been in the business,

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.200
just in terms of I think that we do need
some time to actually sit back,

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.440
and I think we're just gonna move on,
do something different now, I think.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:00.280
In reality, the turning point with Wham!
was nothing to do with Wham!.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.680
[crowd screaming]

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:06.800
The turning point with Wham! was me
as I suddenly thought,

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.160
"Oh my God, I'm a massive star,

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.000
and I'm gay,"

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:17.440
and the depression was about that.
It was about the way I'd boxed myself in.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.400
You know, careful what you wish for.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.200
[Andrew] We had achieved everything

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.080
as that superstar band,

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.440
and we were growing up.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:37.520
It got to a point
where I didn't want any more of it.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.080
Are you jealous of his solo success?

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.920
Don't mention the solo stuff!

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.480
No, I feel I'm a big part of it, you know?

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:48.200
-What are you gonna do when it stops?
-What am I gonna do?

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:51.040
Hopefully, I'll retire with grace
or do something with grace.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.080
[George] Because I'd come out to Andrew,

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.240
he understood
there was more than a band at stake.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:00.880
It was kind of my sanity,

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:05.000
and he didn't put any pressure on me
to continue.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:12.360
He already knew why I was feeling trapped.

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.520
How do you feel when George has a hit
that you're not in,

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:19.720
and when he does music with other artists?

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.760
-Do you feel left out?
-No, no. I think it's…

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.280
I think it's what he should be doing.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:29.680
You know, it allows his own
artistic, um… creativity to expand,

You're basically saying

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.680
is that if it works for George, fine,
and what works for you is fine.

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.600
Yeah.

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.920
There are occasionally rumors
that you two may separate,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.800
go opposite directions.
Can you foresee such a time, Andrew?

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.040
-Such a time? There'll be a time, yeah.
-Mm.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.840

ready to finish because,

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.440

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.000
he… he was tired of being,

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.080
you know, taken potshots at

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.720
as the lucky guy that's kind of
coasted along with George Michael,

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.360
and I think, you know,
he was so much more than that.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.120
