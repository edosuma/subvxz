NARRATOR: Kids, it's not always rational,
but people on their wedding day

00:03.725 --> 00:05.642
<i>sometimes find themselves</i>
<i>panicking</i>

00:05.644 --> 00:07.894
<i>about whether</i>
<i>they've made the best choice.</i>

00:07.896 --> 00:09.379
I have a better
tie at home!

00:09.381 --> 00:11.398
It's cornflower blue.
It's cornflower blue!

00:11.400 --> 00:14.768
NARRATOR: <i>But lucky for Barney,</i>
<i>he was marrying a rock.</i>

00:14.770 --> 00:16.469
I can't go through
with this wedding.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.143
Last year, when you helped
Victoria escape this church,

00:23.145 --> 00:25.228
how hard was it
to climb down that drainpipe?

00:25.230 --> 00:26.279
Extremely hard.

00:26.281 --> 00:27.781
Okay, so that means
super easy. Thanks.

00:27.783 --> 00:28.949
Wait, wait.
Stop, stop.

00:28.951 --> 00:30.367
What the hell
are you doing?

00:30.369 --> 00:31.985
I just... I can't
go through with this!

00:31.987 --> 00:33.920
No, no. Sorry. I
refuse to be a part

00:33.922 --> 00:35.238
of a third runaway
bride situation.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.007
It's like the dude

00:37.009 --> 00:39.042
in that documentary who kept
having women show up dead

00:39.044 --> 00:40.243
at the bottom of his staircase.

00:40.245 --> 00:41.595
Sure, maybe they all tripped,
but it's like,

00:41.597 --> 00:43.246
do you want
to hang out with that guy?

00:43.248 --> 00:45.599
Gonna think I'm insane, but...

00:45.601 --> 00:49.352
I still think that it's a bad
sign I never found that locket.

00:56.777 --> 01:00.480
Some part of me thought that
Barney would magically find it.

01:00.482 --> 01:01.598
I know.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.932
I know that's unfair of me

01:02.934 --> 01:06.102
to expect that, but... you know,
I want to be with a guy

01:06.104 --> 01:08.655
who comes through for me,
you know?

01:08.657 --> 01:10.140
The guy who,

01:10.142 --> 01:13.043
somehow, against all odds,

01:13.045 --> 01:15.545
finds my locket.

01:15.547 --> 01:18.614
Okay, just, um...
just calm down, stay put.

01:18.616 --> 01:21.718
Uh, I'm-I'm gonna go
get you some water, okay?

Uh, listen,
I have something for you,

01:53.785 --> 01:55.585
but before I give it to you,

01:55.587 --> 01:57.704
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

01:57.706 --> 01:59.489
I was freaking out
a little earlier,

01:59.491 --> 02:01.925
but Lily and Marshall
calmed me down. I'm okay.

02:01.927 --> 02:04.377
Good, good.
So, Robin's a little nervous.

02:04.379 --> 02:05.845
Nervous? Why is she nervous?

02:05.847 --> 02:07.163
I'm not nervous! Who's nervous?!

02:07.165 --> 02:08.681
No one needs to be nervous!

02:08.684 --> 02:11.301
Cornflower blue, Ted.
Cornflower blue!

02:11.303 --> 02:14.521
First off, kudos to Marshall
and Lily for calming you down.

02:16.807 --> 02:20.060
Second, do you...
you remember Robin's locket?

02:20.062 --> 02:21.728
Yeah, of course.

02:21.730 --> 02:23.646
She never found it.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.184
Whoa. How did you...?

02:28.186 --> 02:30.036
I never told you about it
because I was afraid

02:30.038 --> 02:31.204
you'd take it the wrong way,

02:31.206 --> 02:32.722
but I actually wound up
tracking it down.

02:32.724 --> 02:35.125
It's a long story.

02:35.127 --> 02:37.711
I was gonna give it to Robin
as a surprise,

02:37.713 --> 02:40.863
but... she needs it
to come from you.

02:40.865 --> 02:43.032
Ted, I don't know.

02:43.034 --> 02:44.918
Take it. Please.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.920
How'd you find it?

02:46.922 --> 02:48.922
I didn't find it.

02:48.924 --> 02:51.040
You found it.

02:53.227 --> 02:55.228
♪

03:00.518 --> 03:02.235
Hey.
Hey.

03:02.237 --> 03:03.737
What you writing?

03:03.739 --> 03:05.321
Um, it's my wedding day.

03:05.323 --> 03:06.773
What do you think I'm writing?

03:06.775 --> 03:07.824
Suicide note?

03:07.826 --> 03:09.859
Hey-yo! (laughs)

03:09.861 --> 03:11.611
Oh, God, is it
a suicide note?

03:11.613 --> 03:13.747
Oh, my God,
how many pills did you take?

03:13.749 --> 03:15.365
Quick. How do we
make him vomit?

03:15.367 --> 03:17.584
Uh, remind him he's getting married.
Hey-yo!

03:17.586 --> 03:19.235
(laughs)
Wait. Now I'm confused.

03:19.237 --> 03:20.904
Are you dying?

03:20.906 --> 03:22.505
I'm writing my vows to Robin,

03:22.507 --> 03:25.041
but I want them to be profound
and inspiring,

03:25.043 --> 03:27.410
as if they were written
by the bard himself,

03:27.412 --> 03:29.312
Lionel Richie.

03:29.314 --> 03:30.430
Then why did you wait

03:30.432 --> 03:31.965
until right before the wedding
to compose them?

03:31.967 --> 03:33.099
I didn't.
I've been trying

03:33.101 --> 03:34.884
to get these right for weeks.
Oh.

03:34.886 --> 03:36.586
This is a lot of vows.

03:36.588 --> 03:38.805
Vow-za.

03:38.807 --> 03:40.390
I'll say it again. Vow-za.

03:40.392 --> 03:42.142
Are you really gonna
read all of these?

03:42.144 --> 03:44.227
Yeah, uh, wouldn't it be better
to project them

03:44.229 --> 03:45.395
as a VowerPoint presentation?

03:45.397 --> 03:47.480
(clicks tongue)
Say it again. VowerPoint...

03:47.482 --> 03:49.616
I know it's a lot,
but I-I don't

03:49.618 --> 03:51.934
want to screw up
this wedding thing.

03:51.936 --> 03:54.604
"I vow to love you
forever unconditionally,

03:54.606 --> 03:57.273
"unless you pudge out,
in which case

03:57.275 --> 04:00.243
I'm a Barney-shaped
hole in the wall."

04:00.245 --> 04:02.295
"I vow to start watching
hockey with you..""

04:02.297 --> 04:03.446
Oh, that one's sweet.

04:03.448 --> 04:04.998
I know how much
you hate hockey.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.249
"...once a month""

04:06.251 --> 04:07.750
But it's still
a nice gesture.

04:07.752 --> 04:09.419
"No. Once a year.
No. Hockey's dumb.

04:09.421 --> 04:11.137
"Not watching it, and
neither are you, woman.

04:11.139 --> 04:12.338
Now make me
French toast""

04:12.340 --> 04:14.123
I'll put this in
the maybe pile.

04:14.959 --> 04:17.142
Look, if you're
having trouble,

04:17.144 --> 04:18.978
you've got two expert
vow consultants

04:18.980 --> 04:20.730
standing right
in front of you.

04:20.732 --> 04:22.932
Yeah. We can show
you vow it's done.

04:24.385 --> 04:25.902
Say it again.
Vow it's done...

04:25.904 --> 04:28.438
We're just not
enjoying them, honey.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.657
I am not gonna take
marriage advice from a couple

04:30.659 --> 04:32.525
who just got
in a gigantic fight.

04:32.527 --> 04:34.143
I'm doing fine on my own.

04:34.145 --> 04:35.778
No, you're not.

04:35.780 --> 04:39.332
All of these vows are selfish
and way too easy to keep.

04:39.334 --> 04:42.035
Wedding vows need
to be real commitments,

04:42.037 --> 04:43.436
like our vows.

04:43.438 --> 04:44.587
Poppycock!

04:44.589 --> 04:45.788
What are you
talking about?

04:45.790 --> 04:47.957
I remember
your precious wedding vows,

04:47.959 --> 04:51.444
and I guarantee you've broken
every single one of them.

04:51.446 --> 04:52.846
Vow dare you!

04:52.848 --> 04:53.847
Just stop.

04:53.849 --> 04:56.950
I can't.
It's invowluntary.

04:56.952 --> 04:58.852
(knocking)
Yeah.

04:58.854 --> 05:00.637
Hey. You asked for me?

05:00.639 --> 05:02.689
Look what Barney
just gave me.

05:04.024 --> 05:05.525
No way!

05:05.527 --> 05:07.777
See? Barney came through.

05:07.779 --> 05:09.145
There's your sign.

05:09.147 --> 05:10.680
You're good to go.

05:10.682 --> 05:12.448
Where'd you find
the locket, Ted?

05:18.538 --> 05:20.071
Where did you find the locket?

05:20.073 --> 05:21.923
Me? Why-why are you asking me?

05:21.925 --> 05:23.792
Barney found it. Ask him.

05:23.794 --> 05:25.243
What, you lost a locket?

05:25.245 --> 05:27.395
Barney wouldn't tell me
how he found it,

05:27.397 --> 05:30.215
which made me realize
it had to be you.

05:30.217 --> 05:32.267
(laughs):
Okay.

05:32.269 --> 05:34.352
I'll embarrass him.

05:34.354 --> 05:36.605
Your fiancé got a metal detector

05:36.607 --> 05:39.724
and scoured a 10,000-square-foot
grid around that carousel.

05:39.726 --> 05:41.443
Guess where he found it.

05:41.445 --> 05:44.029
The nest of a mama pigeon.

05:44.031 --> 05:46.815
(laughs): Barney had to wrestle
it away from four baby pigeons.

05:46.817 --> 05:48.717
But here's where the story
gets bittersweet.

05:48.719 --> 05:51.736
I lied. Barney said it was
in Marshall and Lily's basement.

05:51.738 --> 05:55.240
But do you still want to finish
your little pigeon story?

05:55.242 --> 05:57.209
The mama pigeon gets killed
by a cab.

05:57.211 --> 05:59.494
Barney still goes back
to the park every day

05:59.496 --> 06:01.413
to feed the babies. The end.

06:02.281 --> 06:04.416
Tell me the truth.

06:05.284 --> 06:07.302
Okay, I-I tracked it down,

06:07.304 --> 06:09.671
and I gave it to Barney
to give to you.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.106
Honestly, it was no big deal.

06:11.108 --> 06:12.090
How did you find it?

06:12.092 --> 06:14.626
Psh. How does anybody
find anything?

06:14.628 --> 06:15.760
<i>You hear it might be in your</i>

06:15.762 --> 06:16.978
<i>race car pencil box.</i>
<i>It's not there.</i>

06:16.980 --> 06:18.230
<i>So you swing by</i>
<i>your ex-fiancée's</i>

06:18.232 --> 06:19.347
<i>storage locker</i>
<i>on the opposite coast.</i>

06:19.349 --> 06:20.482
<i>It's not there.</i>

06:20.484 --> 06:22.067
<i>You learn Victoria has it</i>
<i>in Germany,</i>

06:22.069 --> 06:23.735
<i>but Jeanette intercepts it,</i>
<i>throws it in Central Park Lake.</i>

06:23.737 --> 06:25.353
<i>It's a nice day for a swim,</i>
<i>so what the heck?</i>

06:25.355 --> 06:27.272
You dive in, scoop it up, make
<i>it home in time for</i> Jeopardy!

06:27.274 --> 06:28.773
Ease to the pease.
Happy wedding.

06:32.745 --> 06:35.597
You're seriously questioning
our wedding vows?

06:35.599 --> 06:37.866
Us? Uh, we're adorable.

06:37.868 --> 06:40.835
We're Marshmallow
and Lilypad, bitch.

06:40.837 --> 06:42.704
Okay, I'll give you this.

06:42.706 --> 06:45.657
Your little pre-wedding
wedding out by the tree--

06:45.659 --> 06:47.825
you said some very sweet stuff.

06:47.827 --> 06:49.928
<i>Hell, Ted even cried.</i>

06:49.930 --> 06:50.712
(scoffs)

06:50.714 --> 06:51.913
Ted.

06:52.748 --> 06:55.100
But later,
at the actual wedding...

06:55.102 --> 06:56.418
Lily Aldrin,

06:56.420 --> 07:00.205
I vow to be there for you
in sickness and in health.

07:00.207 --> 07:01.473
Hate to tell you, Lilypad,

07:01.475 --> 07:03.341
but Marshall has since
confessed to me

07:03.343 --> 07:05.610
that en route
to your honeymoon...

07:05.612 --> 07:08.063
(retching):
Oh. Oh, God.

07:09.949 --> 07:11.683
(snoring)

07:11.685 --> 07:13.451
You son of a beech.
You son of a beech.

07:13.453 --> 07:15.019
Do you deny it?

07:16.689 --> 07:18.156
Lily, you know
I'm not a vomit guy,

07:18.158 --> 07:19.958
and I just thought
I should give you your space.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.242
Like a dying cat.

07:21.244 --> 07:22.477
Oh, yeah, that saves it.

07:22.479 --> 07:23.862
I'm so sorry I let you down.

07:23.864 --> 07:25.863
Hang on there,
Marshmallow.

07:25.865 --> 07:28.383
Remember when
the blushing bride said...

07:28.385 --> 07:31.670
I vow to honor and respect you.

07:31.672 --> 07:34.139
Maybe she was blushing because
she was lying her ass off.

07:34.141 --> 07:35.473
Not two months later...

07:35.475 --> 07:37.425
Shh.
Okay. Okay.

07:40.045 --> 07:41.746
Hey, not cool!

07:41.748 --> 07:45.317
You will not take a picture
of my husband like that!

07:47.086 --> 07:48.236
(laughter)

07:48.238 --> 07:49.504
(camera clicks)

07:49.506 --> 07:50.839
MARSHALL:
<i>You took part</i>

07:50.841 --> 07:53.224
in the bearded Wonder Woman
incident of 2007?

07:53.226 --> 07:55.727
Lily, that photo got
all over Friendster

07:55.729 --> 07:59.564
and Myspace and... man,
2007 was a long time ago.

08:00.282 --> 08:01.616
Ted, I can't believe

08:01.618 --> 08:03.752
how much trouble you went
through to get this for me.

08:03.754 --> 08:05.587
It really wasn't
that much trouble.

08:05.589 --> 08:06.821
Yes, it was.

08:07.590 --> 08:09.574
You always go big for me.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.343
Not as big as Barney.

08:11.345 --> 08:13.678
Canadian rehearsal dinner
on ice-- big.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.463
The way he proposed-- huge.

08:15.465 --> 08:16.681
Yeah, but think about it.

08:16.683 --> 08:17.966
Those are the most loving things

08:17.968 --> 08:19.551
that Barney has ever done
for me,

08:19.553 --> 08:20.869
and they're all based on lies.

08:20.871 --> 08:23.138
Right down to taking
credit for this locket.

08:23.140 --> 08:24.356
That's not fair.

08:24.358 --> 08:25.690
I told Barney
to take credit for it.

08:25.692 --> 08:27.692
Which he did
without blinking an eye.

08:27.694 --> 08:28.593
Because lying

08:28.595 --> 08:30.111
is second nature to Barney.

08:30.113 --> 08:31.312
Everything's legendary.

08:31.314 --> 08:32.813
You know what "legendary" means?

08:32.816 --> 08:34.097
Not real.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.234
I mean,
the man's initials are "B.S."

08:36.236 --> 08:39.738
If it helps, I'm pretty sure
Barney Stinson's a fake name.

08:40.222 --> 08:42.023
I'm kidding.

08:42.025 --> 08:45.443
You're the one who always
comes through for me, Ted.

08:45.445 --> 08:48.213
The one who's there for me.

08:49.298 --> 08:51.499
Maybe I'm making a mistake.

08:51.501 --> 08:54.402
Wait. What-what are you saying?

08:55.838 --> 08:58.306
Maybe I should be marrying you.

08:59.875 --> 09:02.126
Wait. I know one vow we kept.

09:02.128 --> 09:06.347
I vow to make you breakfast
in bed every Sunday morning.

09:06.349 --> 09:07.382
Really? You still do that?

09:07.384 --> 09:09.934
Absolutely.

09:09.936 --> 09:12.353
(baby crying)

09:12.355 --> 09:14.606
MARSHALL:
Heads up!

09:15.658 --> 09:18.610
Oh! No cream cheese?

09:19.412 --> 09:21.479
Oh.

09:21.481 --> 09:23.948
BARNEY:
<i>Oh!</i>

09:23.950 --> 09:25.917
You feed her like Sloth
from <i>Goonies.</i>

09:25.919 --> 09:27.519
So the magic's still there.

09:27.521 --> 09:28.837
Well, here's one

09:28.839 --> 09:30.789
you definitely didn't keep.

09:30.791 --> 09:34.492
I vow to keep
the romantic spark alive.

09:34.494 --> 09:37.028
And how is that going
for you these days?

09:37.030 --> 09:38.463
MARSHALL:
Are you watching Marvin?

09:38.465 --> 09:39.881
I'm trimming my nose hair.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.299
LILY:
I'm dumping out.

09:41.301 --> 09:43.134
I watched him
all morning, Lily.

09:43.136 --> 09:44.302
I need a break.

09:44.304 --> 09:46.438
I don't control when my
deuces happen, Marshall.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.640
Deuces are wild!

09:48.642 --> 09:50.725
(laughing)

09:50.727 --> 09:51.876
Ted,

09:51.878 --> 09:53.862
I should be with you.

09:53.864 --> 09:55.864
NARRATOR:
<i>There it was-- the words</i>

09:55.866 --> 09:58.466
that some deep, dark part of me
<i>always wanted to hear.</i>

09:58.468 --> 09:59.701
<i>But it's funny.</i>

09:59.703 --> 10:01.970
<i>Once you actually</i>
<i>hear those words out loud...</i>

10:01.972 --> 10:03.788
I don't want to hear that.

10:03.790 --> 10:04.873
We should get out of here.

10:04.875 --> 10:07.659
You and me right now.
We'll...

10:07.661 --> 10:09.294
We'll move to Chicago.
W-We'll start a new life.

10:09.296 --> 10:10.495
It'll-it'll be painful
at first,

10:10.497 --> 10:12.030
but, hell, I can root
for the Blackhawks.

10:12.032 --> 10:13.298
Stop! Stop!

10:13.300 --> 10:15.333
You're just saying this
because you're scared.

10:15.335 --> 10:18.036
I am not your
future. Barney is.

10:18.038 --> 10:21.489
Shouldn't I be with the guy
who finds me my locket?

10:21.491 --> 10:24.509
The guy who steals me
the blue French horn.

10:24.511 --> 10:26.678
I mean, look me in the eye
and tell me,

10:26.680 --> 10:28.263
why shouldn't I be
with that guy?

10:28.265 --> 10:31.349
Because I'm not that guy
anymore.

10:31.351 --> 10:34.936
Then why did you work so hard
to find me my locket?

10:34.938 --> 10:36.571
It... it was a wedding gift.

10:36.573 --> 10:38.690
Ted, stop it, okay?
I know you better than that.

10:38.692 --> 10:40.692
This is more
than a wedding gift.

10:40.694 --> 10:43.995
Maybe it started out that way.
Maybe some part of me thought...

10:43.997 --> 10:46.447
That you still loved me.

10:46.449 --> 10:47.866
Maybe.

10:47.868 --> 10:49.501
But the truth is...

10:49.503 --> 10:51.586
I don't love you
like that anymore.

10:52.505 --> 10:53.905
And you don't love me.

10:53.907 --> 10:55.056
You love Barney.

10:55.058 --> 10:56.374
And if you think

10:56.376 --> 10:59.544
I would ever be part
of screwing that up,

10:59.546 --> 11:02.447
then maybe you don't know me
at all, Robin.

11:02.449 --> 11:04.148
(groans)

11:04.150 --> 11:05.800
I... I can't shake it.

11:05.802 --> 11:07.468
I-I can't shake this feeling

11:07.470 --> 11:10.922
that nothing about me and Barney
makes any sense.

11:10.924 --> 11:13.107
But love doesn't make sense.

11:13.109 --> 11:14.192
I mean, you can't

11:14.194 --> 11:16.194
logic your way into
or out of it.

11:16.196 --> 11:20.064
Love is totally nonsensical,
but we have to keep doing it

11:20.066 --> 11:23.100
or else we're lost
and-and love is dead

11:23.102 --> 11:25.286
and humanity
should just pack it in.

11:25.288 --> 11:28.323
Because love is
the best thing we do.

11:29.825 --> 11:32.710
Look, I know that sounds cheesy,
but it's-it's just true.

11:32.712 --> 11:36.664
You love Barney,
and-and he loves you.

11:36.666 --> 11:39.334
And that doesn't
have to make sense

11:39.336 --> 11:41.302
to make sense.

11:43.672 --> 11:47.475
Remember back when you had
never even seen me pee?

11:47.477 --> 11:49.811
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:49.813 --> 11:51.396
Oh, sorry.

11:51.398 --> 11:52.797
We were so innocent then.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.298
So many dreams.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.150
Trying to work over here.

11:56.152 --> 11:57.769
Bright, shimmering future ahead.

11:57.771 --> 12:00.438
Now we're basically
a couple of wild animals

12:00.440 --> 12:03.074
grunting at each other
to throw some toilet paper

12:03.076 --> 12:05.460
through the crack
in the bathroom door.

12:05.462 --> 12:07.144
Baby, let's be honest.

12:07.146 --> 12:11.499
At this point,
that door is wide open.

12:11.501 --> 12:13.501
You know what you should use
the next time you run out

12:13.503 --> 12:15.286
of toilet paper?
Your wedding vows.

12:15.288 --> 12:16.921
'Cause that's all
your marriage has been,

12:16.923 --> 12:19.257
one long six-year wipe

12:19.259 --> 12:21.509
after that double-flusher
of a wedding.

12:21.511 --> 12:23.294
Stinson out!

12:25.497 --> 12:26.464
You okay?

12:26.466 --> 12:27.715
Yeah.

12:27.717 --> 12:29.701
You're right.
I'm-I'm being insane.

12:29.703 --> 12:30.802
Oh, come on, Robin.

12:30.804 --> 12:33.521
That's... accurate.

12:33.523 --> 12:34.772
(chuckles)

12:34.774 --> 12:36.224
We can't run away together.

12:36.226 --> 12:38.226
(chuckles)
Of course not.

12:38.228 --> 12:40.612
So I'm just gonna run away
alone!

12:44.400 --> 12:46.567
(panting)

12:48.037 --> 12:49.687
Damn it.

12:49.689 --> 12:51.556
(panting)

12:51.558 --> 12:52.907
(yelps) Whoa!

12:52.909 --> 12:55.977
NARRATOR: <i>And that's how Robin</i>
<i>met your mother.</i>

12:59.685 --> 13:02.153
Wait, what are
we doing here?

13:02.155 --> 13:04.522
Lily, our-our
wedding vows,

13:04.524 --> 13:07.141
maybe they were just too
perfect for real life.

13:07.143 --> 13:09.977
Real life is messier
than that, and...

13:09.979 --> 13:12.780
we're different people
than we were in 2007.

13:12.782 --> 13:13.815
But that's okay.

13:13.817 --> 13:16.684
Maybe we just need
some updated vows.

13:16.686 --> 13:18.453
So I thought maybe
before this place

13:18.455 --> 13:22.707
gets too busy, we could...
borrow this altar for a minute.

13:26.178 --> 13:28.179
Lily Aldrin,

13:28.181 --> 13:31.933
I vow to stop shouting stuff
at you when you're dumping out.

13:31.935 --> 13:33.284
You're the love
of my life,

13:33.286 --> 13:36.104
and you deserve
to make a deuce in peace.

13:37.523 --> 13:40.141
I vow to stop pointing out
every dog erection we see

13:40.143 --> 13:41.559
when we walk through the park,

13:41.561 --> 13:43.844
even though they are
incredibly weird looking.

13:43.846 --> 13:46.631
Oh, just don't point and scream
"Maybe it's Maybelline."

13:47.900 --> 13:50.401
Marshall Eriksen,
I vow to always tell you

13:50.403 --> 13:52.787
when you have green stuff
in your teeth.

13:52.789 --> 13:54.772
You have green stuff
in your teeth.

13:54.774 --> 13:56.241
Oh.
(chuckles)

13:56.243 --> 13:59.961
I vow to always sit next to you
and hug you,

13:59.963 --> 14:01.880
even if you're covered in vomit,

14:01.882 --> 14:02.947
whether it's yours

14:02.949 --> 14:04.883
or Marvin's or--

14:04.885 --> 14:08.035
in the case of what came to be
known as Spew Year's Eve 1998--

14:08.037 --> 14:10.388
my own. Sorry.

14:10.390 --> 14:12.173
I vow to stop getting
so angry...

14:12.175 --> 14:13.308
Ooh, I just thought of
another one.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.375
...when you interrupt me.

14:14.377 --> 14:15.894
Mine was to interrupt you less,

14:15.896 --> 14:17.428
so that's good.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.348
I vow...

14:20.350 --> 14:23.551
to finally stop petitioning
Paul McCartney

14:23.553 --> 14:26.554
to let Weird Al record
"Chicken Pot Pie"

14:26.556 --> 14:30.074
to the tune of
"Live and Let Die."

14:30.076 --> 14:31.776
It's over.

14:31.778 --> 14:33.328
I'll let it go.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.396
I vow...

14:35.398 --> 14:38.533
to cry less
during this pregnancy.

14:38.535 --> 14:41.119
I vow to cry less
during this Vikings season.

14:41.121 --> 14:43.788
Mm, with that secondary,
I wouldn't make that promise.

14:43.790 --> 14:47.375
I vow to keep at least 80%
of these vows.

14:47.377 --> 14:48.927
That seems high.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.430
And I vow to keep updating them
as we go.

14:53.515 --> 14:55.082
Because one set of vows,

14:55.084 --> 14:57.969
it can't cover a lifetime
of growing

14:57.971 --> 15:00.204
and changing with you,

15:00.206 --> 15:03.090
of raising children with you...

15:04.259 --> 15:07.895
...falling more and more in love
with you every day,

15:07.897 --> 15:10.782
Lily Aldrin,
which is what I vow to do

15:10.784 --> 15:12.850
for the rest of my life.

15:12.852 --> 15:17.038
Crap. I already broke
my crying vow.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.790
I'll forgive you.

15:28.601 --> 15:30.635
I am so sorry. Are you okay?
Oh...

15:30.637 --> 15:32.420
That was
totally my fault.

15:32.422 --> 15:34.222
No. The bride is always right.
It was my fault.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.340
Are you okay?

15:35.342 --> 15:37.342
I'm fine.

15:37.344 --> 15:39.644
Are you sure?

15:39.646 --> 15:41.296
Because you
were sprinting

15:41.298 --> 15:43.564
from a church
in a wedding dress.

15:43.566 --> 15:44.799
And as a kid,

15:44.801 --> 15:46.734
I was a bit of a detective...

15:46.736 --> 15:48.069
(chuckles):
so...

15:48.071 --> 15:50.238
Um...

15:50.240 --> 15:52.824
to be honest,
I'm-I'm wondering if this...

15:52.826 --> 15:56.711
whole getting married thing is
something I can go through with.

15:56.713 --> 15:59.163
Oh.

15:59.165 --> 16:01.699
Wow.

16:01.701 --> 16:04.085
That's it?

16:04.087 --> 16:06.287
Aren't you supposed
to talk me out of it?

16:06.289 --> 16:09.156
Tell me it's just cold feet?
I'm-I'm being crazy?

16:09.158 --> 16:11.709
Okay, during that fall, we did
kind of get to second base

16:11.711 --> 16:13.511
with each other--
and we'll always share that--

16:13.513 --> 16:16.147
but I don't really know you.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.365
So...

16:17.367 --> 16:18.666
here's all I'll say:

16:18.668 --> 16:20.000
when I'm overwhelmed,

16:20.002 --> 16:21.686
I force myself
to do one simple thing

16:21.688 --> 16:24.338
before I have to make
a decision:

16:24.340 --> 16:28.676
close my eyes
and take three deep breaths.

16:28.678 --> 16:31.145
Three deep breaths.
Mm-hmm.

16:31.147 --> 16:34.866
Sometimes even three deep
breaths can change everything.

16:44.710 --> 16:47.962
(breathing deeply)

16:57.573 --> 16:58.906
Barney?

16:58.908 --> 17:00.842
Hey, I've been looking
for you. You okay?

17:00.844 --> 17:03.678
Uh... yeah.
I-I was just talking to the...

17:03.680 --> 17:07.432
the band about the...
thing with the stuff.

17:07.434 --> 17:09.166
What are those?

17:09.169 --> 17:10.401
My vows.

17:11.386 --> 17:13.387
I-I know it's bad luck
to see the bride

17:13.388 --> 17:16.324
right before the ceremony,
but I realized something.

17:16.326 --> 17:19.226
Marshall and Lily have broken
most of their wedding vows,

17:19.228 --> 17:21.079
but they're still
the best couple I know.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.780
I think their biggest problem

17:22.781 --> 17:25.532
was that Marshall
didn't tell Lily the truth.

17:25.535 --> 17:28.234
So...

17:29.922 --> 17:32.907
I've decided to make
only one vow to you,

17:32.909 --> 17:36.844
because it's the only one
that really counts.

17:36.846 --> 17:39.097
Robin Scherbatsky...

17:40.249 --> 17:42.316
...from this day forward,

17:42.318 --> 17:45.052
I am always gonna be honest
with you.

17:46.004 --> 17:47.839
'Cause I love you.

17:49.108 --> 17:50.708
I'll see you up there.

17:51.376 --> 17:54.278
Oh.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.147
Ted got that locket for you.

17:56.149 --> 17:58.265
He's the one you should thank.

18:00.819 --> 18:02.987
Barney, wait.

18:14.115 --> 18:17.618
(Pachelbel's Canon in D playing)

18:21.890 --> 18:22.990
(quietly):
What is it?

18:22.992 --> 18:24.642
The cornflower blue tie.

18:24.644 --> 18:26.561
That's the one
I should be wearing.

18:27.646 --> 18:29.647
It's right by my bed.
Back in Manhattan.

18:29.649 --> 18:31.983
Stall for me. I'll be back
in six hours, tops.

18:35.637 --> 18:36.854
That's all of 'em!

18:36.856 --> 18:38.206
Wow.

18:38.208 --> 18:39.157
Wait.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.942
I'm free.

18:40.944 --> 18:42.660
It's over.

18:42.662 --> 18:45.997
The slap bet is finally... over?

18:45.999 --> 18:47.815
Yeah, it is, buddy.

18:47.817 --> 18:50.418
(exhales)
Thank you.

18:54.039 --> 18:55.322
You know, this
may sound crazy,

18:55.324 --> 18:56.791
but I'm gonna miss
that slap bet.

18:56.793 --> 18:58.376
No, you won't.
No, you're right. I won't.

18:58.378 --> 19:00.928
(Handel's "Hornpipe"
from <i>Water Music</i> playing)

19:21.567 --> 19:22.683
Hi.

19:22.685 --> 19:23.901
Hi.

19:24.903 --> 19:26.704
