20:44.202 --> 20:45.870
I'm very attracted

20:44.202 --> 20:45.870
to you.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.287
Oy...

20:47.287 --> 20:48.581
I found a hair!

20:49.749 --> 20:50.750
Yes!

20:50.750 --> 20:52.126
Okay, come here,

20:50.750 --> 20:52.126
come here.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.669
Take a look

20:52.126 --> 20:53.669
at this.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.047
Ever since I found out

20:53.669 --> 20:56.047
that you left the message

20:56.047 --> 20:57.631
on Jerry's tape recorder,

20:56.047 --> 20:57.631
I--

20:57.631 --> 20:59.258
Whoa.

21:00.927 --> 21:01.928
That was you?

21:01.928 --> 21:04.055
It was a joke.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.140
Wait...

21:06.849 --> 21:08.601
Oh, my God.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.270
Oh, yeah.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.275
Elaine, I can't believe

21:13.189 --> 21:16.275
that that is you.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.443
I--

21:23.532 --> 21:25.367
I think I'll get going.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.203
Er, stick around

21:25.367 --> 21:27.203
a while.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.246
It's early.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.289
We'll order Chinese.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.253
All right,

21:33.417 --> 21:35.253
give me the tape!

21:35.253 --> 21:37.671
I had it first! It was my tape!

21:35.253 --> 21:37.671
Give me the tape!

21:37.671 --> 21:40.466
[♪♪♪]

21:44.053 --> 21:47.014
A woman left me a message on

21:44.053 --> 21:47.014
my phone machine the other day

21:47.014 --> 21:49.016
with kind of a breathy voice,

21:47.014 --> 21:49.016
you know.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.434
No matter what a woman says,

21:50.434 --> 21:52.728
if it's in that breathy voice,

21:50.434 --> 21:52.728
you know, it...

21:52.728 --> 21:53.813
"You have cancer."

21:53.813 --> 21:54.897
Really?

21:54.897 --> 21:57.357
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

21:57.357 --> 21:58.818
Sounds pretty good.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.402
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

22:00.402 --> 22:01.904
The stewardess could lean over

22:01.904 --> 22:03.156
and whisper in my ear,

22:03.156 --> 22:04.949
"Would you put on

22:03.156 --> 22:04.949
your seat belt?

22:04.949 --> 22:08.119
We're about to go

22:04.949 --> 22:08.119
into a mountain."

22:08.119 --> 22:10.704
I would go, "Really?

22:08.119 --> 22:10.704
So, what are you doing later

22:10.704 --> 22:13.624
by the ruptured remains

22:10.704 --> 22:13.624
of the fuselage?

22:13.624 --> 22:17.461
How about some peanuts

22:13.624 --> 22:17.461
over by the black box?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.046
Look, I'll meet you there."
