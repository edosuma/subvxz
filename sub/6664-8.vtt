00:00.066 --> 00:03.702
Adult adam: <i> Growing up,</i>
<i> we all have our</i>
<i> embarrassing secrets.</i>

00:03.704 --> 00:06.705
<i> ¶ well, I guess</i>
<i> it would be nice</i>

00:06.707 --> 00:09.141
<i> ¶ if I could touch your body</i>

00:09.143 --> 00:11.043
<i> ¶ I know not everybody</i>

00:11.045 --> 00:13.712
<i> ¶ has got a body like you,</i>
<i> ohh ¶</i>

00:13.714 --> 00:16.215
Adult adam: <i> Mine was</i>
<i> that I loved george michael</i>

00:16.217 --> 00:18.384
<i> And I wanted to dance</i>
<i> exactly like him.</i>

00:18.386 --> 00:20.552
<i> Yep, this was</i>
<i> the kind of secret</i>

00:20.554 --> 00:21.620
<i> I didn't want to</i>
<i> tell anyone...</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:24.757
(music stops)
<i> even my best friend,</i>
<i> emmy mirsky,</i>

00:24.759 --> 00:26.625
<i> And we told each other</i>
<i> everything.</i>

00:26.627 --> 00:28.093
So, what's it gonna be,
muscles?

00:28.095 --> 00:31.597
It's the biggest
decision of my life.
Just let me think.

00:31.599 --> 00:32.564
What's to think about?

00:32.566 --> 00:35.367
Brian mcmann made it
pretty darn clear.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.969
Do you like him?
Yes or no?

00:36.971 --> 00:39.772
Can't I just write in
a third box that says
"maybe?"

00:39.774 --> 00:42.474
You've been in love
with him since
first grade.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.510
I'm checking "yes."
no!

00:45.345 --> 00:45.778
Okay.

00:45.780 --> 00:48.547
I'm gonna tell you
the hugest secret
on the planet,

00:48.549 --> 00:50.616
But you have to swear
on our friendship

00:50.618 --> 00:51.917
You won't ever tell
anyone.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.018
Okay. I swear
on our friendship.

00:53.020 --> 00:57.289
I kissed rob butchenhart
behind the gym
during the fire drill.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.223
No way!

00:58.225 --> 00:59.258
I've spun quite the web.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.460
All right. I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.128
But you got to swear
on our friendship,

01:03.130 --> 01:07.599
Under penalty of death,
that you won't
ever tell anyone.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.802
Done.
I pulled that fire alarm.

01:09.804 --> 01:10.602
What? Why?

01:10.604 --> 01:11.503
I sat in pudding
at lunch.

01:11.505 --> 01:14.640
I didn't want anyone
to misinterpret
the situation.

01:14.642 --> 01:15.441
I got something
to tell you,

01:15.443 --> 01:18.444
But you have to swear
on our friendship
you won't get mad.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.011
I swear.

01:19.013 --> 01:20.479
I put that pudding cup
on your chair.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.681
Damn it!
Now I can't get mad.

01:22.683 --> 01:23.849
Stupid friendship swear.

01:23.851 --> 01:24.883
(laughing)
you know what?

01:24.885 --> 01:26.051
I'm marking "yes."
what? No!

01:26.053 --> 01:27.753
Adult adam: <i> You may wonder,</i>
<i> if we told</i>

01:27.755 --> 01:29.555
<i> All this embarrassing stuff</i>
<i> to each other,</i>

01:29.557 --> 01:32.057
<i> Why would I keep</i>
<i> my awesome moves a secret?</i>

01:32.059 --> 01:33.559
<i> This is why.</i>
(vcr clicks)

01:33.561 --> 01:37.696
<i> ¶ ...Love comes down</i>
<i> without devotion</i>

01:37.698 --> 01:40.532
<i> ¶ well, it takes</i>
<i> a strong man, baby</i>

01:40.534 --> 01:42.568
<i> ¶ but I'm showin' you</i>
<i> the door</i>

01:42.570 --> 01:44.503
<i> ¶ 'cause I gotta have faith ¶</i>

01:44.505 --> 01:47.306
(gasps)
snuggle monster!

01:47.474 --> 01:49.108
I can't believe
you broke your arm dancing.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.977
It was either that
or when mom
jumped on me.

01:51.979 --> 01:52.578
I'm so psyched.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.080
This severe compound
fracture is my ticket
to popularity.

01:55.082 --> 01:58.383
Nerd's right.
Everybody loves
the kid in the cast.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.752
Yeah, until everybody
finds out how he broke it.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.654
Why? What's wrong
with a lonely boy

02:02.656 --> 02:04.123
In his room
videotaping himself

02:04.125 --> 02:07.025
Shaking his groove thang
to george michael?

02:07.027 --> 02:08.093
Yeah, I hear it now.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.361
Just come up
with a good lie.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.362
Something cool.
Got it!

02:10.364 --> 02:13.499
You were van-surfing
like stiles from
<i> teen wolf!</i>

02:13.501 --> 02:15.567
Idiot,
we don't have a van.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.269
No, wait...
Something about ninjas!

02:17.271 --> 02:19.204
No, wait, sharks.
Ninja sharks!

02:19.206 --> 02:20.105
Just keep it simple.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.141
Say you broke it
skateboarding or something.

02:22.143 --> 02:25.611
I'm telling you...
Ninja sharks.

02:25.613 --> 02:29.047
Adult adam: <i> Erica was right.</i>
<i> Keep it cool and simple.</i>

02:29.049 --> 02:31.517
<i> And I knew just the thing.</i>

02:31.519 --> 02:33.252
<i> That year, robert zemeckis,</i>

02:33.254 --> 02:34.286
<i> Director of</i>
back to the future ii,

02:34.288 --> 02:36.321
<i> Gave an interview</i>
<i> where he admitted</i>

02:36.323 --> 02:38.357
<i> That hoverboards were,</i>
<i> in fact, real.</i>

02:38.359 --> 02:40.259
Zemeckis: <i> They've been</i>
<i> around for years.</i>

02:40.261 --> 02:41.226
<i> It's just that parents' groups</i>

02:41.228 --> 02:43.996
<i> Have not let</i>
<i> toy manufacturers</i>
<i> make them.</i>

02:43.998 --> 02:45.631
<i> But we got</i>
<i> our hands on some.</i>

02:45.633 --> 02:46.798
Adult adam:
<i> Thanks to mr. Zemeckis,</i>

02:46.800 --> 02:49.468
<i> I had a cover story</i>
<i> anyone would believe.</i>

02:49.470 --> 02:50.402
Hoverboard.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.638
I was on a hoverboard!

02:52.906 --> 02:54.039
Ahhh.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.374
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:55.376 --> 03:00.345
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

03:01.581 --> 03:02.514
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:02.516 --> 03:06.818
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:06.820 --> 03:08.987
Adult adam:
<i> It was December 3rd,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

03:08.989 --> 03:13.158
<i> And just like every night,</i>
<i> my mom was working</i>
<i> her fingers to the bone</i>

03:13.160 --> 03:14.026
<i> To make us dinner.</i>

03:14.028 --> 03:15.994
<i> She whisked, balled,</i>
<i> and breaded,</i>

03:15.996 --> 03:19.097
<i> Customizing each plate</i>
<i> to our tastes.</i>

03:19.099 --> 03:21.300
Extra meat sauce.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.868
No meat sauce.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.702
Just meat sauce.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.204
Adult adam:
<i> And for all the hard work,</i>

03:25.206 --> 03:27.239
<i> This was the thanks</i>
<i> she'd always get.</i>

03:27.241 --> 03:28.874
(sighs)
jello again?

03:28.876 --> 03:31.210
I hate this stuff.
Barf.

03:31.212 --> 03:31.877
Excuse me!

03:31.879 --> 03:34.780
I have been slaving
over a hot stove all day.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.648
Do you know
how many meals in a row

03:36.650 --> 03:38.550
I've cooked
for you people?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.318
53,000.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.720
That can't be right.
Thank your mother.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.721
Kids: Thank you.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.489
Oh. That's not why
I do it.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.291
Adult adam: <i> It's exactly</i>
<i> why she did it.</i>

03:46.293 --> 03:48.293
I mean,
sure, my feet ache,

03:48.295 --> 03:50.295
And I've done permanent
damage to my arches

03:50.297 --> 03:53.799
And probably ruined
a very lucrative
dance career,

03:53.801 --> 03:54.700
But I think
it's worth it.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.301
Adult adam:
<i> My dad didn't normally</i>
<i> get involved,</i>

03:56.303 --> 03:58.403
<i> But when it came to food,</i>
<i> he was full of ideas.</i>

03:58.405 --> 04:01.773
You know what, bevy?
I think you should take
tomorrow off.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.842
What's that?
Murray:
Yeah, a new restaurant

04:03.844 --> 04:05.244
Opened up
around the corner.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.511
It's called china garden.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.647
Chinese food? Never had it,
so I don't like it.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.282
Adult adam: <i> Yep, the '80s</i>
<i> was a simpler time,</i>

04:10.284 --> 04:12.417
<i> When your small town</i>
<i> only had four restaurants.</i>

04:12.419 --> 04:14.753
<i> The bar and grill,</i>
<i> the sandwich place,</i>

04:14.755 --> 04:16.255
<i> The other sandwich place,</i>

04:16.257 --> 04:17.055
<i> And bennigan's...</i>

04:17.057 --> 04:19.191
<i> Which was also</i>
<i> a sandwich place.</i>

04:19.193 --> 04:19.992
Come on. It looks good.

04:19.994 --> 04:23.829
There's a happy dragon
on the sign patting his
full tummy.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.265
You know, dave kim's
parents own that place.

04:26.267 --> 04:29.701
Oh! Maybe we can get
some free french fries!

04:29.703 --> 04:30.736
Hey, stupid.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.337
It's chinese fries.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.372
Well, I'm sold.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.140
Let dave kim's mom
deal with

04:35.142 --> 04:36.074
You ungrateful animals
for the night.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.311
Adult adam:
<i> But there was one thing</i>
<i> my mom didn't count on...</i>

04:39.313 --> 04:43.015
<i> Chinese food is</i>
<i> the greatest thing ever!</i>

04:43.017 --> 04:44.683
Holy balls!

04:44.685 --> 04:47.753
They put pork
inside of a pancake...

04:47.755 --> 04:48.320
Right inside!

04:48.322 --> 04:49.655
I feel like
I'm crying a little.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.724
Flavor is literally
exploding through
the crispy skin,

04:52.726 --> 04:53.792
Right into
my taste buds!

04:53.794 --> 04:55.794
It's a little greasy
for my palate.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.063
Adult adam: <i> Said my</i>
<i> insanely jealous mom.</i>

04:58.065 --> 05:00.198
Everybody enjoying
the food so far?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.199
Erica: Oh, my god, yes.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.301
We're gonna come
tomorrow night

05:02.303 --> 05:04.503
And every other night
for the rest of our lives.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.271
Dave kim
is a very lucky boy.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.240
Adult adam: <i> In that moment,</i>
<i> beverly goldberg saw</i>

05:08.242 --> 05:12.311
<i> Another mom get something</i>
<i> she'd never got before...</i>

05:12.313 --> 05:14.246
<i> True appreciation.</i>

05:14.248 --> 05:16.014
Moo shu?

05:16.016 --> 05:17.282
Oh!

05:17.284 --> 05:18.917
Oh, that was my fault.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.787
Um (exhales sharply)
well, it's ruined now.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.889
I guess that means
we should go, huh?

05:23.891 --> 05:25.190
Ah, don't sweat it.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.992
We'll get
another one of those.

05:26.994 --> 05:27.859
And I'll tell you what...

05:27.861 --> 05:30.896
A refill on this delicious,
exotic tea.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.864
Mmm.
That's duck sauce.

05:33.366 --> 05:34.066
That is good.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.768
Adult adam: <i> While my mom</i>
<i> was feeling overshadowed</i>
<i> by pork dumplings,</i>

05:36.770 --> 05:40.439
<i> I was the center of attention,</i>
<i> thanks to my latest injury.</i>

05:40.441 --> 05:43.008
So, how'd you
break your arm, klutz?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.776
I fell off a hoverboard.
No biggie.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.679
Hey, I heard they're
serving square pizza
for lunch. Who's in?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.349
Whoa. Wait.
You were on a hoverboard?

05:50.351 --> 05:51.616
As in
a flying skateboard?

05:51.618 --> 05:54.586
We all know
what a hoverboard is,
dave kim.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.455
This putz.
So, pizza!

05:56.457 --> 05:58.090
Wait. Are you serious
right now?

05:58.092 --> 06:00.559
True story,
I was walking
through the mall,

06:00.561 --> 06:03.128
And a scientist
walked up to me,
a real doc brown type,

06:03.130 --> 06:06.131
And he asked if
I wanted to be in
a select group of kids

06:06.133 --> 06:08.233
To test
hoverboard technology.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.102
Yeah, I call bullcrap.

06:10.104 --> 06:12.003
Tell us
what really happened.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.305
Adult adam:
<i> I was losing them.</i>

06:13.307 --> 06:15.774
<i> I either had to expose</i>
<i> myself as a dancing loser</i>

06:15.776 --> 06:17.042
<i> Or pull out the big guns.</i>

06:17.044 --> 06:20.579
They may not believe me,
but you will.

06:21.013 --> 06:23.348
I swear
on our friendship.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.619
It happened, people.
He floated on air.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.121
Wait.
Now you believe him?

06:29.123 --> 06:31.790
You can't lie
on a friendship swear.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.191
It's the rules.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.793
Erica: <i> Are you kidding me?</i>

06:34.795 --> 06:35.560
A hoverboard?

06:35.562 --> 06:38.797
You were supposed to say
something real, like skiing.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.698
Well, that's just crazy.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.134
No one would believe
that I can ski.

06:42.136 --> 06:42.667
Okay, relax.

06:42.669 --> 06:45.771
Every kid tells that
one giant lie that gets
away from them.

06:45.773 --> 06:46.438
It's not a big deal.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.375
Yes, it is!
If emmy finds out
I lied on our friendship,

06:50.377 --> 06:51.476
She'll hate me forever.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.578
Want my advice, kiddo?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.279
Lie your ass off.

06:54.281 --> 06:57.983
What? You're supposed
to be my role model
and moral compass.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.918
We're talking about
muscles mirsky, here.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.854
She's a groovy dame
and a hell of a best friend,

07:02.856 --> 07:04.856
And we got to do
whatever it takes

07:04.858 --> 07:05.891
To save this friendship.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.492
But how?
I'm in too deep.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.561
Lucky for you,
I'm an expert liar,

07:09.563 --> 07:12.264
And I'll teach you because
you're the coolest, smartest,

07:12.266 --> 07:14.599
Most capable brother
a girl could ever have.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.901
Really?
No.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.336
But now you see
how good I am.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.678
What is all this?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.013
This... This smells.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.149
Look, you guys just loved
that chinese food so much,

07:31.151 --> 07:33.485
I figured,
why ever go back there

07:33.487 --> 07:35.353
When I can make it all
right here?

07:35.355 --> 07:36.755
I present to you...

07:36.757 --> 07:38.957
Beverly's chinese palace.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.625
(clink)
you sure you know
what you're doing?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.761
Yeah, chinese food seems
kind of complicated.

07:42.763 --> 07:46.298
Well, maybe
for a less-experienced chef.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.432
That ketchup?

07:47.434 --> 07:48.767
It's just a base.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.969
Tsk. You don't
understand cooking.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.404
Okay, all I have to do

07:52.406 --> 07:54.339
Is put this block
of frozen broccoli

07:54.341 --> 07:56.374
Into the boiling-hot grease,

07:56.376 --> 07:57.742
And...

07:57.744 --> 07:59.845
(extinguisher spraying)

07:59.847 --> 08:01.913
(all coughing)

08:02.081 --> 08:02.581
Beverly: Okay.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.617
Beverly's chinese palace
is officially closed.

08:05.619 --> 08:09.254
But I can still whip up
some of my shrimp parm.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.455
Who wants shrimp parm?
Huh?

08:10.457 --> 08:13.925
Shrimp parm?
Shrimp parm? Shrimp parm?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.360
(engine turns over)
(gearshift clicks)

08:15.362 --> 08:19.231
(tires screech)
shrimp parm!
Shrimp parm!

08:20.032 --> 08:20.966
Last call.

08:20.968 --> 08:24.536
Adult adam: <i> By the end</i>
<i> of the week, we had been</i>
<i> to china garden 5 times,</i>

08:24.538 --> 08:26.605
<i> And my mom had had enough.</i>

08:26.607 --> 08:27.239
Excuse me.

08:27.241 --> 08:29.641
Hi. I don't know
if you remember me.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.342
I'm beverly goldberg.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.511
Yes, of course.
You're the mom
who I thought

08:32.513 --> 08:34.513
Worked at the school
'cause she's there so much.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.514
I'm involved, yes.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.816
Uh, but today,
I have a teeny, tiny favor.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.185
I need you
to ban my family

08:40.187 --> 08:41.853
From eating here
for life, okay?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.955
But they're
great customers.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.858
We have a dish
named after that one.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.893
"big tasty pork."

08:47.895 --> 08:50.729
It's fried pork
with regular pork on top.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.130
He would love that,
yes.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.565
Uh, look, let's talk
mother-to-mother, here.

08:53.567 --> 08:57.235
You have kids.
You know that dinner
is special family time.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.204
I'm sorry,
but it's not my fault

08:59.206 --> 09:01.873
That your family likes
my food better than yours.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.808
(bell dings)

09:04.010 --> 09:05.010
Listen...

09:05.012 --> 09:06.778
I didn't come here
looking for a war,

09:06.780 --> 09:09.881
But I didn't come here
to turn one down, either.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.449
I'm not scared of you.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.684
Oh, you will be.

09:12.686 --> 09:16.187
Watch your back,
dave kim's mom.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.156
(bell dings)

09:25.064 --> 09:27.899
Adult adam: <i> At school,</i>
<i> I had laid down</i>
<i> a thick pile of bullcrap,</i>

09:27.901 --> 09:31.369
<i> And there was only</i>
<i> one person with the skills</i>
<i> to shovel me out.</i>

09:31.371 --> 09:35.407
Okay, time to learn
america's greatest
art form...

09:35.409 --> 09:36.007
Lying.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.843
A liar is, if nothing else,
a salesman.

09:38.845 --> 09:39.945
You got to sell your lie,

09:39.947 --> 09:42.414
And to do that,
you got to believe it.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.748
Now, tell me a lie.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.950
I'm a fish.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.452
Just do
the hoverboard thing.

09:47.553 --> 09:48.520
I rode a hoverboard.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.021
Horrible!
You have like 10 tells!

09:50.023 --> 09:53.258
No eye contact,
you're fidgeting,
and you smell like fear.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.262
That might be the cast.
It's gotten super-stinky.
Smell.

09:57.264 --> 09:57.762
No! Focus!

09:57.764 --> 10:02.233
The number-one rule
to lying is to never,
ever back down.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.070
Just keep lying until
you come out the other side.

10:05.072 --> 10:05.804
Other side. Got it.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.840
Now, look me in the eye
and make me believe it.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.308
I rode a hoverboard.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.076
Again.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.978
I rode a hoverboard.
Again!

10:12.980 --> 10:14.613
I rode a hoverboard!
Again!

10:14.615 --> 10:16.848
I rode a hoverboard!

10:17.850 --> 10:18.416
Okay.

10:18.418 --> 10:22.220
Odd thing to say
when we're talking
about mitochondria,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.588
But, uh,
since you brought it up,

10:23.590 --> 10:25.256
I feel obligated
as your science teacher

10:25.258 --> 10:27.993
To inform you all
that hoverboards
aren't real.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.294
Well,
that's your opinion.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.229
No, that's the opinion
of gravity.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.464
It's a gray area.
Couldn't be clearer.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.532
Well, we can agree
to disagree.
No, we can't.

10:34.534 --> 10:37.469
Hold up. Are you calling
adam a big, fat liar?

10:37.471 --> 10:41.272
With all due respect
to mr. Goldberg...

10:41.274 --> 10:42.140
100%, yes.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.275
Well,
you're a 100% dook.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.244
Principal's office, now.

10:46.246 --> 10:46.878
Worth it!

10:46.880 --> 10:50.682
As for the rest of you,
science is based
on empirical evidence,

10:50.684 --> 10:52.817
So unless mr. Goldberg here
can provide some,

10:52.819 --> 10:57.055
I will implore you all
not to believe a word
he says.

10:57.057 --> 10:57.589
I have a video.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.691
You have a video?
You have a video?

10:59.693 --> 11:01.126
I said
"principal's office!"

11:01.128 --> 11:02.260
In your face!
He's got a video!

11:02.262 --> 11:06.131
If that's true, then
everything I know about
science would be wrong

11:06.133 --> 11:08.733
And reality as we know it
would shatter.

11:08.735 --> 11:09.267
Dogs would fly.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.936
I would be dating
claudia schiffer!

11:11.938 --> 11:13.972
So...We cool?

11:13.974 --> 11:15.340
Oh, yeah. We cool.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.043
So cool that if you show
that video in class,

11:18.045 --> 11:20.045
I'll give everyone in here
an "a."

11:20.047 --> 11:22.580
(cheers and applause)

11:25.184 --> 11:26.317
How was school, poopie?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.420
Worst day ever.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.322
Hey, can I curl up
in a ball on the way back
while you drive?

11:31.324 --> 11:33.291
Aw, schmoo,
what's wrong?

11:33.293 --> 11:34.959
You can tell mama
anyth...

11:34.961 --> 11:35.827
Oh, is that dave kim?

11:35.829 --> 11:38.229
Dave kim!
Dave kim!

11:38.231 --> 11:38.963
What are you doing?

11:38.965 --> 11:40.298
Let's invite him
over for dinner.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.533
I don't want to invite him
over for dinner!

11:41.535 --> 11:44.235
Just lay down
in the way back
and be sad, okay?

11:44.237 --> 11:48.339
Dave kim! Adam wants
to invite you over
for dinner, dave kim!

11:48.341 --> 11:49.474
No, no, no.
Drive, drive, drive!

11:49.476 --> 11:52.444
Dave kim!
Please be our guest
at our home tonight!

11:52.446 --> 11:53.978
If you want to come over...
Adam: Drive! Drive! Drive!

11:53.980 --> 11:56.748
Just get in the
backseat now.
Adam: Drive! Drive!

11:56.750 --> 11:58.383
Dave kim!

11:58.818 --> 11:59.784
(gasps)

11:59.786 --> 12:02.554
Well! If it isn't
dave kim's mom.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.988
Funny
you should drop on by.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.790
You called me
to pick up my son.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.425
Did I? Huh.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.359
Well, yes, he's here,

12:08.361 --> 12:11.262
Just going to town
on my shrimp parm.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.331
He loves my cooking.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.166
Maybe even
more than yours.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.735
Mom,
you got to try this.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.603
It's both fishy
and cheesy.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.740
You can't put cheese
on seafood!

12:21.742 --> 12:24.175
It breaks
every culinary law!

12:24.177 --> 12:27.946
(chuckles)
I'll put cheese
on anything.

12:27.948 --> 12:28.580
Anything.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.881
You can't
cheese anything.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.383
I once cheesed
a slice of watermelon.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.418
That's disgusting.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.719
Or is it delicious?

12:34.721 --> 12:35.720
This is delicious.

12:35.722 --> 12:36.588
Enjoy.
(chuckles)

12:36.590 --> 12:39.224
I told him to
come back tomorrow
night with his sister.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.893
Jenny, is it?
Sweet girl.

12:41.895 --> 12:45.130
She's gonna love
my mac and cheese meatballs.

12:45.132 --> 12:45.697
That's right.

12:45.699 --> 12:49.634
I'll combine an
entree and side
into a super-dish.

12:49.636 --> 12:50.735
I don't give a (bleep)

12:50.737 --> 12:52.704
You don't want
to take me on, lady.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.439
This is one food war
you can't win.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.409
Oh, I'll win.
Shrimps will be cheesed,
tummies will be stuffed,

12:58.411 --> 13:01.112
And your kids will be
begging to come here

13:01.114 --> 13:03.882
During special
family-dinner time.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.718
So, what's it gonna be?
(sighs)

13:08.988 --> 13:12.423
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We can't serve you here.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.458
You're talking
to those two, right?

13:13.460 --> 13:17.128
I don't understand.
Why are we on the wall,
like a bunch of criminals?

13:17.130 --> 13:20.298
Yeah! I need
my big tasty pork!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.233
Please!
It's my birthright!

13:22.235 --> 13:23.001
Let's just say...

13:23.003 --> 13:27.539
Some mothers love
their family so much,
it's scary.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.607
Beverly.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.110
Adult adam: <i> While my dad</i>
<i> was heading back to</i>
<i> deal with my mom,</i>

13:32.112 --> 13:35.847
<i> I was heading</i>
<i> back to the future!</i>

13:40.052 --> 13:41.686
(drill whirs)

13:41.921 --> 13:44.889
(angelic choir sings)

13:45.791 --> 13:47.058
<i> Unfortunately, in my version,</i>

13:47.060 --> 13:49.194
<i> The future looked</i>
<i> kind of crappy.</i>

13:49.196 --> 13:49.761
<i> Yippee!</i>

13:49.763 --> 13:54.899
Here I am,
testing out the world's
first actual hover...

13:54.901 --> 13:55.700
Ow! Ow!

13:55.702 --> 13:56.868
It's squishing my parts.

13:56.870 --> 14:00.171
Cut. I can see the rope.
This looks shoddy.

14:00.173 --> 14:00.939
You think?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.608
You said to keep lying
till I get to the
other side.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.310
When do I get
to the other side?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.111
Just shut up and hover!

14:07.113 --> 14:07.679
(scoffs) god.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.715
Beverly: <i> Oh. Yeah. There.</i>
<i> Just like that. Yep.</i>

14:10.717 --> 14:13.551
That actually looks
not that crappy.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.019
<i> Damn it. Cut!</i>

14:15.021 --> 14:15.653
Someone's in the shot.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.122
<i> I can't see!</i>
<i> Spin me around!</i>

14:18.991 --> 14:20.325
Oh! Spin me back!

14:20.327 --> 14:21.426
Are you kidding me?

14:21.428 --> 14:22.861
Emmy, I can explain.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.597
Here are
your get-well cookies.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.565
(sighs)

14:27.567 --> 14:29.500
Come back!

14:29.835 --> 14:30.535
Emmy! Wait!

14:30.537 --> 14:31.736
I don't want
to talk to you.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.072
Just let me explain.
No.

14:34.074 --> 14:34.672
I stood up for you.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.342
I got an in-school suspension
and grounded for a month.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.209
But even worse...

14:38.211 --> 14:40.278
I told a bunch of people
hoverboards are real!

14:40.280 --> 14:44.048
Trust me, the truth
is too embarrassing.
You would've lied, too.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.116
Not to you.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.118
I'm sorry, okay.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.987
But it's me.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.521
You can't hate
your best friend.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.023
That's the thing.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.858
You're not just a friend.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.728
You're like my brother.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.597
And if I can't
count on you...

14:59.599 --> 15:00.732
Then I have nobody.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.367
Adult adam:
<i> And just like that,</i>

15:02.369 --> 15:04.969
<i> My best friend</i>
<i> hovered out of my life.</i>

15:04.971 --> 15:06.070
(door closing)

15:06.072 --> 15:08.439
Bev! You've got
a lot of nerve!

15:08.441 --> 15:11.109
We're grown men.
You cannot control us.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.845
Don't be silly.
Of course I can.

15:13.847 --> 15:14.979
Fine! You can!

15:14.981 --> 15:16.748
But the one freedom
we have is food,

15:16.750 --> 15:18.683
And you can't take that
away from us.

15:18.685 --> 15:19.651
I won't let you!

15:19.653 --> 15:21.586
Let's discuss it
over dinner.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.689
Sit down. I made
cheeseburger meatloaf.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.491
Adult adam: <i> Behold my mom's</i>
<i> secret weapon.</i>

15:26.493 --> 15:29.727
<i> It was cheese. It was meat.</i>
<i> It was loaf.</i>

15:29.729 --> 15:30.428
<i> And it was spectacular.</i>

15:30.430 --> 15:33.965
No! The woman's just
trying to use your hunger
to control you.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.067
Just a little taste.
No taste!

15:36.069 --> 15:37.635
Can we at least
munch some
of the topping?

15:37.637 --> 15:40.238
No! We're never eating
her food again.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.373
Well, china garden's
not an option,

15:42.375 --> 15:43.174
So where else
you gonna go?

15:43.176 --> 15:45.443
We'll go to bamboo palace
downtown.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.311
Come on, guys!
Let's go!

15:46.313 --> 15:49.614
You'd never drive
into the city during
rush hour.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.281
Oh, I will for this.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.583
Well, then I'll have you
banned from there, too.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.118
Banned from chinatown
entirely.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.187
Then we'll switch
to indian food.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.389
Your stomach
can't handle the spices.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.424
Then we'll get sushi!

15:59.426 --> 16:02.293
Raw fish?
You don't even like
raw carrots.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.195
Then we'll get
thailand food!

16:04.197 --> 16:06.531
That's right!
Food from wherever that is!

16:06.533 --> 16:09.934
Why are you working
so hard to take
this away from me?

16:09.936 --> 16:10.835
Take what away from you?

16:10.837 --> 16:13.438
You're acting crazy!
It's just dinner!

16:13.440 --> 16:15.273
Not to me!

16:15.541 --> 16:18.443
(sighs) you all have
your other things going on.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.110
Your work, your school,

16:19.112 --> 16:21.813
Your hypersexual
lifestyle.
Hey.

16:21.815 --> 16:25.083
For me, this kitchen,
these meals...

16:25.085 --> 16:26.284
It's all I've got.

16:26.286 --> 16:30.188
It's the only thing
I still do that makes
me feel needed.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.723
So, yeah,
maybe that makes me crazy,

16:31.725 --> 16:35.893
But cooking for my family
means everything to me.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.568
Adult adam:
<i> Emmy had found out that</i>
<i> I'd never rode a hoverboard.</i>

16:43.570 --> 16:47.872
<i> It was only a matter of time</i>
<i> before the rest of the class</i>
<i> learned the truth.</i>

16:47.874 --> 16:49.240
<i> There was no way out.</i>

16:49.242 --> 16:50.908
I have a way out.
It's too late.

16:50.910 --> 16:54.712
I don't have time
to come up with
a whole new web of lies.

16:54.714 --> 16:55.913
That's why
I did it for you.

16:55.915 --> 16:59.550
I got lainey to
steal this from her dad's
sketchy law office.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.418
Nondisclosure agreement?

17:00.420 --> 17:03.187
Just say that the
scientist from the mall
made you sign it

17:03.189 --> 17:05.923
And you legally can't show
your hoverboard video.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.892
Class has started,
mr. Goldberg.

17:07.894 --> 17:11.429
We're all waiting for you
to take us into the future.

17:11.431 --> 17:14.365
Oh!
Oh, I'm hovering!

17:14.367 --> 17:18.002
So, I know everyone
was excited to see
that video

17:18.004 --> 17:19.771
Of me hoverboarding,

17:19.773 --> 17:21.372
But I can't show it.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.341
(students grumbling)

17:23.942 --> 17:26.444
You know what?
Instead, I'll show you this.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.981
This is how I really
broke my arm.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.349
<i> (faith</i> plays)

17:31.351 --> 17:32.650
(students laughing)

17:32.652 --> 17:35.286
<i> ¶ I guess it would be nice</i>

17:35.288 --> 17:37.889
<i> ¶ if I could touch your body</i>

17:37.891 --> 17:40.324
<i> ¶ I know not everybody</i>

17:40.326 --> 17:43.094
<i> ¶ has got a body like you</i>

17:44.530 --> 17:45.430
<i> ¶ ohhh ¶</i>

17:45.432 --> 17:46.998
All: Oh!
(laughing)

17:47.000 --> 17:47.598
Oh, man!

17:47.600 --> 17:50.802
I wanted that easy "a,"
but this is so much better.

17:50.804 --> 17:54.338
Well, sorry, pal.
I was rooting for you.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.907
No, you weren't.
That's right.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.943
'cause I always root
for science.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.445
<i> ¶ baby ¶</i>

18:00.447 --> 18:02.080
Emmy!

18:02.082 --> 18:04.849
So, now you know
the truth.

18:04.851 --> 18:05.616
Changes nothing.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.752
All you did was expose
yourself as a wham! Fan.

18:07.754 --> 18:11.255
Technically,
it's george michael's
solo effort.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.192
But probably
not your point.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.694
Um, so,
it's Friday night.

18:16.696 --> 18:17.728
See you
at the treehouse?

18:17.730 --> 18:20.665
Dude, what part of this
don't you get?

18:20.667 --> 18:21.232
No, I get it.

18:21.234 --> 18:24.936
But you said it yourself.
We're more than
just friends.

18:24.938 --> 18:25.903
We're family.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.306
And in my family,
we fight, scream,

18:28.308 --> 18:32.143
And make horrible mistakes
that go way too far.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.946
But an hour later,
we're fine.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.380
That's what it means
to be a goldberg,

18:36.382 --> 18:40.218
And, like it or not,
you're one of us.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.453
<i> ¶ I gotta have faith</i>

18:42.455 --> 18:44.522
<i> ¶ because I gotta have</i>
<i> faith, faith, faith</i>

18:44.524 --> 18:47.825
<i> ¶ I gotta have</i>
<i> faith, faith, faith ¶</i>

18:47.827 --> 18:49.026
If you're looking
for food,

18:49.028 --> 18:51.496
I got your ban lifted
at china garden.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.531
Enjoy
your exotic new lives.

18:53.533 --> 18:57.635
Bevy, we thought
all about what you said,

18:57.637 --> 18:58.236
And we're sorry.

18:58.238 --> 19:01.839
How could you
ever think this family
doesn't need you?

19:01.841 --> 19:04.142
I mean, look at us!

19:04.144 --> 19:04.742
We're a mess!

19:04.744 --> 19:06.944
We'd be living under a rock
if it wasn't for you.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.046
Well, you got a point there.
(chuckles)

19:09.048 --> 19:10.948
We appreciate
what you do for us.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.051
And dad didn't even
tell me to say that.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.187
Thank you, honestly.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.488
Now, what do you say
we have some real dinner?

19:17.490 --> 19:21.459
Adult adam:
<i> And with that, a new</i>
<i> goldberg tradition began.</i>

19:21.461 --> 19:24.061
<i> Our Friday-night dinner</i>
<i> at china garden.</i>

19:24.063 --> 19:24.762
(all laughing)

19:24.764 --> 19:27.331
Big tasty pork,
on the house.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.100
We're glad you're back.

19:29.102 --> 19:29.767
Barry: Oh!

19:29.769 --> 19:32.036
Murray: Hey, calm down.
All right, good.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.905
(knock on door)

19:33.907 --> 19:35.806
Emmy: Hey, klutz.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.377
So you don't hate me?

19:39.379 --> 19:40.511
After showing that tape,

19:40.513 --> 19:43.314
You're gonna need
all the friends you can get.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.350
Just, don't ever
lie to me again.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.352
I swear it
on our friendship.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.389
(chuckles)
so, how's the cast?

19:51.391 --> 19:53.191
Oh, it's so itchy.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.192
It's driving me crazy.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.861
I have skinny fingers.
Let me see if I can help.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.629
Adam: That's just tickling me.
(emmy laughs)

19:58.631 --> 20:00.231
Adult adam: <i> That's the</i>
<i> thing about family.</i>

20:00.233 --> 20:01.599
<i> You fight, you yell,</i>
<i> but in the end,</i>

20:01.601 --> 20:05.736
<i> There's no one you'd rather</i>
<i> share chinese with.</i>

20:07.172 --> 20:10.474
<i> Emmy, there are some people</i>
<i> in your life right now</i>

20:10.476 --> 20:13.477
<i> That you sort of have</i>
<i> these kind of crushes on.</i>

20:13.479 --> 20:14.545
<i> Now,</i>
<i> out of all these people,</i>

20:14.547 --> 20:16.647
<i> Is there anyone you</i>
<i> particularly like the most?</i>

20:16.649 --> 20:18.049
<i> Do I have to say this</i>
<i> on film?</i>

20:18.051 --> 20:19.750
<i> Well, I mean,</i>
<i> it's not gonna...</i>

20:19.752 --> 20:20.718
<i> No one's gonna see it</i>
<i> or anything.</i>

20:20.720 --> 20:24.121
<i> Uh, I don't.</i>
<i> I'm not sure I can</i>
<i> trust you with that.</i>

20:24.123 --> 20:26.257
<i> Oh, you can trust me.</i>

20:26.425 --> 20:30.228
I'm telling you,
notre dame's gonna go
all the way this year.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.529
What, to some
random bowl game?

20:31.531 --> 20:34.365
There's never gonna be
a true national champion

20:34.367 --> 20:36.067
Until we have
a playoff system.

20:36.069 --> 20:39.570
That's a good idea.
They should do that.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.504
(scoffs)
I was kidding!

20:40.506 --> 20:41.906
They're never
gonna do that!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.741
What are you getting
so excited?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.076
Because
you're aggravating me!

20:45.078 --> 20:48.246
Stop aggravating him
and come have dinner.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.680
<i> (faith</i> plays)
erica!

20:49.682 --> 20:51.682
Turn off the music
and get down here!

20:51.684 --> 20:55.219
<i> ¶ and when that love</i>
<i> comes down</i>

20:55.221 --> 20:57.255
<i> ¶ without devotion</i>

20:57.257 --> 20:59.557
<i> ¶ well, it takes</i>
<i> a strong man, baby</i>

20:59.559 --> 21:01.692
<i> ¶ but I'm showin' you</i>
<i> the door</i>

21:01.694 --> 21:03.628
<i> ¶ 'cause I gotta have... ¶</i>
aaah!

21:03.630 --> 21:05.162
I have faith.
What are you
doing here?

21:05.164 --> 21:07.531
Your mom's making
seafood pizza.
I can't miss that.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.901
I swear to god,
you better not tell
a soul about this.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.971
Oh, no, no.
This one's just for
dave kim.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.173
I'm serious.
You tell no one.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.843
Of course.
I swear on our friendship.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.044
What friendship?

21:20.046 --> 21:21.579
So, it's more than that?

21:21.581 --> 21:22.613
Get out!

21:22.615 --> 21:24.348
<i> ¶ maybe ¶</i>
