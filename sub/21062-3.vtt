- Come on, we're talking
about our son, okay?

12:52.550 --> 12:55.417
You weren't thinking about
our son when you were messing
around with those hookers

12:55.470 --> 12:58.155
or when you
publicly humiliated us.

13:05.340 --> 13:07.820
Come on, Charley,
you know my background, okay?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.565
I didn't have
what you had.

13:09.610 --> 13:11.384
There was
no father figure
in my life,

13:11.440 --> 13:14.432
not until I met you
and then Ernest became
my father, too, okay?

13:14.480 --> 13:17.836
And look, even though Ernest
had Nova and Ralph Angel,

13:17.880 --> 13:19.916
even though
he was with True
and not Lorna,

13:19.970 --> 13:22.700
and even though he lived
in Louisiana and you were
all the way in California,

13:22.750 --> 13:24.354
he was there for you
while you grew up.

13:24.410 --> 13:25.354
You know why?

13:25.410 --> 13:27.571
He had access to you.

13:27.630 --> 13:30.588
He was allowed,
and without drama.

13:30.630 --> 13:33.064
That's one thing
Lorna got right,
and you know it.

13:33.110 --> 13:35.670
I need that.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.278
I need that
if I'm gonna be

13:37.330 --> 13:39.286

to be for Micah.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.516
You almost convinced me
that you're snncere.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.859
I actually have
to remind myself

13:54.920 --> 13:57.138

every time you speak.

13:59.220 --> 14:02.781
I'm not sharing
custody.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.092
And if Micah doesn't say
he wants it,

14:05.140 --> 14:06.960
there's no way
you're getting it.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.625
And don't ever
compare yourself
to my father again.

14:09.670 --> 14:12.662
You don't even deserve to_be
In the same sentence as him.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.848
I know you signed my name
to get your loan, Charley.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.899
Yeah.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.987
My lawyer put alerts
on my financials
when you filed.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.643
Just let me be
in my son's life,
Charley.

I'll tell the bank.

this loan thing again,

I love your work

Is that how
this all goes?

18:38.420 --> 18:40.581
Okay.

Jelani:_
Dr. Dub0Is,
in your recent work,

19:43.390 --> 19:44.994
you've been making
the case that,

19:45.050 --> 19:47.268
while not often
thought of as such,

19:47.310 --> 19:51.007
mass incarceration is actually
a public health crisis
in black communities.

19:51.050 --> 19:54.838
Yes, all the data shows
that when we tear up a family
through incarceration,

19:54.880 --> 19:57.223
we eventually get
devastating health outcomes,

19:57.280 --> 20:00.625
and the high recidivism rates
mean that the problems that come

20:00.670 --> 20:04.800
from the poor healthcare
received by inmates in prison
is just recycled

20:04.850 --> 20:08.024
right back into
those vuln_e_rable
communItIes.

20:08.070 --> 20:09.856
Shouldn't we be asking
how those communities

20:09.900 --> 20:11.379
b_ecome_vulnerable
In the ﬁrst place?

20:11.420 --> 20:14.378
Yes, the "necropolitics"
of it all.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.591
You sound "skeptical,"
Dr. Dubois.

Well, Mbembe's term can be
defined in different ways.

20:19.650 --> 20:21.379
How do you see it,
Ms. Bordelon?

20:21.430 --> 20:23.739
Necropolitics
is the question.

20:23.780 --> 20:27.739
Who does society say
is disposable or trash?

20:27.790 --> 20:29.872
Who are the real-life

then social death,

or political irrelevance.

we should just say

the brothers up

of the sisters left behind?

20:43.850 --> 20:45.715
It's not semantics.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.320
Saying it plain keeps us
from normalizing

20:48.370 --> 20:51.157

genocide.

original point about the man.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.131

than we are,

believes about us.

22:10.410 --> 22:13.197
I disagree, Dr. Dubois.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.014
He always
believed in us.

22:15.070 --> 22:16.935
He always knew
our greatness.

22:16.980 --> 22:19.153
That's the very thing
he feared

22:19.200 --> 22:21.248
and the very thing
he worked so hard

22:21.290 --> 22:23.338
all these generations
to destroy.

22:25.990 --> 22:28.424
Look, I'm here today
simply because

I had a bail fundraiser
in New Orleans.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.124
It was peaceful.
It was respectful.

22:33.170 --> 22:34.990
It was beautiful.

22:37.740 --> 22:40.300
It was self-determined,
self-empowered.

have been apart for a while.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.369
We're gonna
get out of here

39:00.420 --> 39:02.069
because no one wants
to hear all that.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.372
No, no, no.
I-- I won't have it.

39:04.420 --> 39:06.593
- You don't have to--
- No, she got a point.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.460
Grown folks gotta be grown.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.477
And now that you're back,
I think it's time

39:12.520 --> 39:14.772
I start looking
for a place, too.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.343
Baby, you don't
have to do that.

39:19.480 --> 39:21.744
See you lovebirds
in a couple days.

39:21.790 --> 39:23.178
Bye.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.744
- Love you, Micah.
- Love you, too.

39:25.790 --> 39:28.918
- Love you, Vi.
- Love you, Hollywood.

39:28.970 --> 39:31.359
Mmm...

39:35.320 --> 39:37.800
Hey.
How are you?

39:37.850 --> 39:38.885
Fine.

39:42.850 --> 39:44.670
I'm gonna be
in my room.

39:58.300 --> 40:00.439
I'm surprised
you brought him back.

40:00.480 --> 40:04.439
You said you want a chance
to be a father to our son.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.959
And I don't like it.

40:07.970 --> 40:10.746
But we'll share him
because I think he needs it.

40:12.710 --> 40:13.961
Maybe you do, too.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.455
You know, I would have
never called the bank

40:20.500 --> 40:22.320
about your mill loan,
Charley.

40:22.370 --> 40:24.622
I know that you did
what you've always done,

40:24.680 --> 40:27.854
and that's whatever
you had to do, so.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.856
I got word
the loan funds
tomorrow,

40:29.900 --> 40:33.074
so... thank you.

40:34.470 --> 40:36.290
But you should know...

40:36.340 --> 40:39.810
if you mess this up,
I will find a way to end it.

40:41.430 --> 40:43.819
I will do right
by our son.

40:43.870 --> 40:46.088
I hope so, Davis.

40:48.920 --> 40:50.228
I hope so.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.799
- Checking out.
- Okay.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.239
Room 716.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.838
- Here.
- Thank you.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.593
Well, hello there.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.949
Good morning.
Coffee?

41:17.990 --> 41:20.163
You just happen
to have two?

41:20.210 --> 41:22.201
Well, you know,

41:22.260 --> 41:23.818
I took up
a lot of your time
yesterday.

41:23.870 --> 41:27.340
I-- felt only right
that I give you
a proper sendoff.

41:27.390 --> 41:30.518
Thank you, Dr. Dubois,
for our walk

41:30.570 --> 41:32.526
and especially
for our conversation.

41:32.570 --> 41:34.390
I enjoyed it.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.044
Likewise.

41:36.100 --> 41:39.479
If you ever get
away from Atlanta
and make your way

41:39.540 --> 41:42.316
to New Orleans,
I'll have to return the favor.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.185
Okay. All right.
May I?

41:46.240 --> 41:47.628
- Yes.
- All right.

41:54.810 --> 41:56.937
Listen...

41:56.990 --> 41:59.720
I could take you
to the airport
if you'd like.

41:59.770 --> 42:02.512
I'm okay, thank you.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.073
All right.

42:04.130 --> 42:08.294
Um, if you ever need
some epidemiological...

42:08.350 --> 42:09.772
[laughs]

42:09.830 --> 42:12.435
No, no, seriously,
expertise, I just...

42:12.480 --> 42:14.209
You'll be
my ﬁrst call.

42:14.270 --> 42:16.784
Yes, ma'am.
I look forward
to that call, Queen.

42:19.010 --> 42:20.568
- Travel safe.
- Yeah.

42:20.620 --> 42:23.180
- Okay, all right.
- Thank you.

42:23.230 --> 42:24.447
...overhead,
swift courage

42:24.490 --> 42:29.439
Shoot it down, down

42:29.500 --> 42:33.459
Fill the lung that loves
the phosphorescent

42:33.500 --> 42:38.722
Absorbent time
spent on few

42:38.770 --> 42:40.590
And all of you

42:40.640 --> 42:43.461
I'll offer myrrh
and murder

42:43.510 --> 42:49.335
The preferred method
of doubt that sways about.
