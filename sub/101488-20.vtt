WEBVTT

00:19.436 --> 00:21.354
And I said, "Excuse me,
I know this one says

00:21.438 --> 00:23.148
"'buy one, get one half off,'

00:23.231 --> 00:24.941
but can I just get the half-off one?"

00:25.025 --> 00:26.985
(laughs) The shop guy hated that joke.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.778
(chuckles) What else
is going on with old Linda?

00:28.862 --> 00:31.156
Oh, we're giving the kids a later bedtime.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.782
Bob and I were on the fence about it,

00:32.866 --> 00:34.367
but they did such
a convincing PowerPoint--

00:34.451 --> 00:35.869
so many pie graphs--

00:35.952 --> 00:38.038
and they promised to be
little angels, so we figured,

00:38.121 --> 00:40.081
"Okay, what's the worst
that could happen, right?"

00:40.165 --> 00:42.250
They wake up groggy?
So they drink a little coffee.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.960
Kids in France drink coffee, right?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.795
And they know how to speak
French, so, you know.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.131
Uh-huh.
Can I start cleaning your teeth now?

00:48.214 --> 00:50.133
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry.
Just so much to catch up on

00:50.216 --> 00:51.968
when you only see the dentist, you know,

00:52.052 --> 00:53.595
as often as we come to you.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.555
-Yeah, it should be way more often.
-Right, right.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.016
I'll just open my mouth now. Ah...

00:58.099 --> 00:59.684
Okay, maybe don't make that noise.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.102
First Yap cleans my teeth,

01:01.186 --> 01:02.604
now I'm cleaning your clock, Gene.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.147
Ha-ha. And another box.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.024
It appears it is now my turn,

01:06.107 --> 01:09.194
so I shall hope for the best,
prepare for the worst.

01:09.277 --> 01:12.655
Am I crazy or is that, like,
the dreamiest fox scientist ever?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.824
The first thing you said.
Okay, they're all filled in.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.535
-Let's tally these babies up.
-Is it bad to be attracted

01:17.619 --> 01:19.746
to a cartoon fox that you don't
even know that well?

01:19.829 --> 01:21.831
Hold on. No way.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.001
-Gene won?
-Wait, what? I did?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.212
I-I'm gonna count again. Everybody shush!

01:27.295 --> 01:28.630
-(door opens)
-LINDA: Guess who said your mommy's teeth

01:28.713 --> 01:31.049
had slightly less plaque than usual?

01:31.132 --> 01:33.051
Was it Dr. Yap? 'Cause he's our dentist?

01:33.134 --> 01:35.053
I can't believe it. Gene won.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.806
And I lost. To Gene. Who won.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.683
It sounds weird when I say it out loud.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.351
First, only three cavities, and now this?

01:41.434 --> 01:43.186
Could today get any better?

01:43.269 --> 01:46.439
Wow, Geney, that's so great
with whatever that is.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.525
-What is that?
-Dots and Boxes, Mother.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.652
Your baby boy's a Dots and Boxes winner.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.405
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take it easy.
-Okay, just gonna see

01:53.488 --> 01:55.573
if our insurance is still good here--
fingers crossed. Ha!

01:55.657 --> 01:57.450
Ha-ha, that's fun.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.371
How you liking the new
plug-in air freshener I got?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.707
It's called "Laundry and Spice," hmm?

02:03.790 --> 02:05.834
-It's strong.
-Good waiting room vibe, right?

02:05.917 --> 02:08.420
Sweet smell, sweet magazine spread.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.462
Eh, sweet 'zines.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.006
Someday we'll get music.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.008
Dr. McAllister has music
in her waiting room.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.677
I know. And animals.
But you don't work there anymore.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.595
You work here, and it's more fun, right?

02:17.679 --> 02:19.222
Mm-hmm.
I don't miss it at all.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.599
Dr. Yap, do you give
an extra toy to people

02:21.683 --> 02:24.602
who beat their sister in magazine games?
Hmm?

02:24.686 --> 02:26.062
I mean, I could give you more floss.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.856
And then maybe you'd floss?

02:27.939 --> 02:29.399
Nah, it's not really for me.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.943
Gene, how about we stop hogging
the magazine, huh, buddy?

02:32.027 --> 02:34.279
-Sorry.
-Hey, you.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.989
-Please don't stroke the magazines.
-Yep. Yep.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.116
I didn't kiss it, either,
when no one was looking.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.326
Okay, let's go eat a bunch of taffy.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.996
(chuckles) Just kidding.
Let's get out of here, though.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.500
-(door bells jingle)
-Hey, Teddy. We're-we're not open yet.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.627
That's okay.
I like to watch the prep stuff.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.255
It's like being backstage
at a Broadway play before the show.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.840
Plus, I want to make sure I got my seat.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.134
-Well, you always do.
-LINDA: Honk, honk!

02:56.217 --> 02:58.386
Clean teeth alert, coming through.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.679
-Oh, hey, Teddy.
-LOUISE: Teddy.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.264
-GENE and TINA: Hey, Teddy.
-Hey, Linda, kids.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.891
-I got my seat.
-Yeah, you did.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.309
How was the dentist?

03:04.392 --> 03:06.478
Great.
I swallowed a lot of that fluoride stuff.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.896
But it's good for you, right?

03:07.979 --> 03:09.689
It tastes nice, so it must be good.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.941
-Okay.
-TINA: I fell in love.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.027
I mean, uh, never mind.
I-It wasn't a fox scientist.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.863
I won a game in a magazine,
and the world smiled.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.991
Okay, okay, it was
one Dots and Boxes game.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.951
And I don't even know
if it was regulation.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.662
I mean, the dot layout was
a little dottier than usual.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.123
Hey, so, no judgment, but what's going on

03:27.207 --> 03:28.500
with the bird poop on the window?

03:28.583 --> 03:30.585
-Whoa! Giant bird poop.
-Whoa.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.754
-Oh, my God.
-Ugh, and judging by the looks of it,

03:32.837 --> 03:36.007
-that bird was not well.
-Why would a bird do that to us?

03:36.091 --> 03:37.634
Did we tick off a seagull or something?

03:37.717 --> 03:39.678
I mean, Mom, you yell
all kinds of crazy stuff

03:39.761 --> 03:41.346
-at seagulls.
-That's true.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.556
Well, it's not the first time
someone has used this restaurant

03:43.640 --> 03:45.016
just for the bathroom.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.267
Maybe that's just how seagulls do graffiti

03:46.351 --> 03:47.686
and that seagull is basically Banksy?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.771
Bob, you might want
to get that off before you get

03:49.854 --> 03:51.272
people coming in here for lunch.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.108
Uh, yeah, I-I know, Teddy.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.567
Folks seeing a giant poop smear

03:54.651 --> 03:56.403
right before they enter your restaurant?

03:56.486 --> 03:58.947
That's not good.
(chuckles, sighs)

03:59.030 --> 04:01.116
Yeah, I very much want to clean it off.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.410
-Wait, you're using that?
-Uh, yeah?

04:03.493 --> 04:05.620
Are you nuts?
There's a very specific way

04:05.704 --> 04:07.288
you got to get bird poop off.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.707
You can't just wipe it with a rag, Bob.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.750
Yeah, Dad.
God!

04:10.834 --> 04:12.627
I'm pretty sure it's fine, Teddy.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.463
(strains)
I can't reach it.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.298
Sure you can, Dad.
You just have to believe.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.718
Oh, maybe you can tie a rope
around my waist

04:19.801 --> 04:22.345
and lower me down from the roof,
like a <i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

04:22.429 --> 04:23.972
I've always wanted to do that.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.516
Oh, hey. I know a guy
who's got a pressure washer.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.852
He owes me for when I lent him
my ratchet set.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.729
His wife took his set in the divorce.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.522
Thankfully I got custody of mine.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.274
Teddy, no, please.
I-It's fine.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.901
-I-I will take care of it.
-No, no, no. I'll be quick.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.570
Don't touch it while I'm gone.
You'll make a big mess.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.697
I mean, you're all great.
Just don't touch it.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.657
Ooh. Excuse me.
Don't take my seat!

04:42.741 --> 04:44.951
Okay.
Hello.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.162
Dr. Yap.
Am I seeing double?

04:47.245 --> 04:49.622
Wait, no, you know what I mean.
Twice in one day.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.332
-What's the haps, Yap?
-Hi, Dr. Yap.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.542
What you doing, you eating?

04:52.625 --> 04:53.752
We're not quite open for lunch yet.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.170
And pardon our bird poop.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.130
I-I don't know if we need
to mention that, Lin.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.590
Oh, I don't mind waiting.
And I'll just look away

04:58.673 --> 04:59.883
from the giant poop.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.051
Uh, I'm gonna go get our step ladder

05:01.134 --> 05:02.302
and see if I can reach it.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.555
And I'll be a hero.
Y-You'll all see.

05:05.638 --> 05:09.267
Hey, guess what?
A crazy thing happened to me this morning.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.770
Oh, yeah?
Somebody bite you? Was it me?

05:11.853 --> 05:16.316
Nope. Someone stole a magazine
from my office waiting area.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.734
Can you believe it?

05:17.817 --> 05:19.527
-Oh, no.
-That's terrible.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.945
Who would do such a thing?

05:21.029 --> 05:23.114
I've never stolen a magazine
from an office.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.825
Unless I find a recipe I like.
Or a perfume sample.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.369
Or just for the rush of it.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.412
Wow. Sorry, Dr. Yap.
Did you call the police?

05:29.496 --> 05:30.622
Or the FBI?

05:30.705 --> 05:32.040
Not yet.
Pretty nuts, right?

05:32.123 --> 05:34.459
I mean, I purposely subscribe
under the name

05:34.542 --> 05:37.462
"Dr. Don't Take This Magazine"
so it says it right there

05:37.545 --> 05:40.048
on the address label for everyone to see.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.257
And you think that'd be enough.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.386
Yep.
Bap, bap, bap, bap...

05:44.469 --> 05:46.846
Well, I hope whoever did that
to you gets stung by a bee

05:46.930 --> 05:48.473
right on their butt, in the crack.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.183
Now how about some nice water?

05:50.266 --> 05:53.436
-I will get the water.
-I mean, I-I'm getting it already.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.689
-See? Water.
-That water is stale.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.732
I'll get some fresh water,
from the kitchen sink.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.943
Sisters?
Will you help me fetch the water?

06:00.026 --> 06:02.153
Eh, seems like a one-Gene job.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.155
-Yeah, you're gonna do great.
-Help me fetch the water!

06:04.239 --> 06:05.907
Okay, okay.
Geez.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.951
Gene, what's your deal?

06:08.034 --> 06:09.452
Yeah, I know you have some spill issues

06:09.536 --> 06:10.954
when it comes to water transportation,

06:11.037 --> 06:12.455
but you got to face those head-on.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.666
Guys, I stole the magazine.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.042
-(gasps)
-Sexy fox scientist.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.128
I mean, uh, oh, man.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.964
Gene. Gene, Gene, Gene, Gene.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.344
Wow, Gene.
I got to say, I'm impressed.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.304
Never in a million years would I pin you

06:28.388 --> 06:30.473
for a dental office magazine stealer.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.475
I didn't mean to steal it.
It just happened.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.352
All of a sudden the magazine
was down my shorts

06:34.436 --> 06:35.562
next to my bum-bum.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.646
But why'd you do it?

06:36.730 --> 06:37.981
Are you trying to get into a gang?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.399
No, nothing like that.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.276
I just...
The Dots and Boxes game I won--

06:41.359 --> 06:42.736
I wanted to keep it.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.529
Ugh. One game.

06:44.612 --> 06:47.032
I ate a weird breakfast this morning.
I was off.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.576
Plus, there's, uh,
a really fascinating article

06:49.659 --> 06:52.245
about bubbles that I wanted to read.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.414
Oh, I skimmed that.
"Bubbles, What's Poppin'?"

06:54.497 --> 06:55.832
Some interesting stuff in there.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.792
-Just please help me.
-Well, the good news is

06:57.876 --> 06:59.627
you weren't acting weird out there at all.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.171
-Oh, good.
-I think all we have to do

07:01.254 --> 07:03.173
is play it cool and keep our mouths shut.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.051
Yap's got nothing on you,
so we just have to wait him out.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.179
Oh, cool, we have to not tell
the truth to an adult.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.389
-Cool, cool, cool, cool.
-All right, Gene,

07:11.473 --> 07:13.016
better get that glass
of fresh kitchen water

07:13.099 --> 07:14.809
that you were raving about ready for Yap.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.394
Now give me the magazine.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.104
-We got to hide this.
-I'll hide it.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.647
But let me just
check something real quick.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.358
Hello, there.
You're looking well.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.567
LOUISE:
Give me that.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.611
You can have your freaky
fox thoughts later.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.196
(sighs)
I forgot you guys broke our step ladder

07:26.279 --> 07:28.823
playing that game
"jump on the step ladder."

07:28.907 --> 07:32.369
Oh, I love that game.
The kids get some exercise...

07:32.452 --> 07:34.412
Bob, are you sure
we shouldn't wait for Teddy

07:34.496 --> 07:36.331
to come back
with the pressure cooker thingy?

07:36.414 --> 07:38.792
Pressure washer?
Uh, yes, I'm sure.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.419
I'm already, ugh, halfway done.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.838
Oh, no. That's not good.
It's smearing everywhere.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.590
-Ew.
-Oh, my God.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.676
It's so, so, so much worse now.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.095
Maybe we try to use it
to frost the window?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.889
Like stores do at Christmastime?
But we do it now?

07:52.972 --> 07:55.517
Eh. Boy, I wouldn't want
to be you when Teddy gets back.

07:55.600 --> 08:00.563
-Mm-hmm.
-Whatever you're doing isn't working!

08:00.647 --> 08:02.524
And here is that wonderful kitchen water

08:02.607 --> 08:03.733
I was telling you about.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.985
This is how we always carry glasses.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.362
-Yep, yep.
-Mm-hmm.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.364
Dr. Yap, you're not gonna actually wait

08:09.447 --> 08:11.032
until we open, are you?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.951
And then what are you gonna do, eat here?

08:13.034 --> 08:15.120
Do you really want to put
yourself through that?

08:15.203 --> 08:16.830
I do.
I cleared my schedule.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.457
Nothing on the books
for the rest of the day.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.168
So I've got all the time in the world.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.628
What if there's a dental emergency?

08:23.712 --> 08:25.463
-They're all dental emergencies!
-Aah!

08:25.547 --> 08:28.174
Look, I know you kids took my magazine.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.135
Ho, ho, ho!
Hold on there.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.971
You're accusing us
sweet little children of stealing?

08:33.054 --> 08:35.098
On what grounds, sir?

08:35.181 --> 08:37.726
I know it was you kids.
And I know it because every time

08:37.809 --> 08:40.854
<i>someone leaves my office,</i>
<i>I go and re-fan my magazines</i>

08:40.937 --> 08:43.606
<i>because I'm way better at it</i>
<i>than my receptionist Dorothy.</i>

08:43.690 --> 08:46.693
<i>And when I did that today,</i>
<i>which was right after you kids left,</i>

08:46.776 --> 08:49.612
<i>my</i> Now That's Cool <i>magazine was gone.</i>

08:49.696 --> 08:54.075
I am so sick and tired of patients
stealing my magazines,

08:54.159 --> 08:56.161
messing with the vibe in my waiting room.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.122
I mean, what if I came in
and stole all your n-napkins?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.207
Doesn't feel good, does it?

09:01.291 --> 09:02.834
I mean, they're there for people to take.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.295
-Here. I insist.
-Okay, bad example.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.464
Just hand the magazine over
into this hand right now.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.258
-High five. Sorry. Reflex.
-Down low. Sorry, sorry.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.968
You're yapping up the wrong tree, Yap.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.178
We don't know anything about

09:13.261 --> 09:14.888
whatever it is you were talking about.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.016
Now if you'll excuse us,
we have child labor to do.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.060
Okay, well, that's that, then.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.271
Uh, yeah. I guess our words
finally went into your face.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.399
You know, it'd sure be a shame
if somebody told your parents

09:26.483 --> 09:30.070
about all this and you got
your special later bedtime

09:30.153 --> 09:32.113
-taken away.
-How'd you know about that?

09:32.197 --> 09:35.033
A little bird told me.
Your mom. Your mom was the bird.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.160
Well, doesn't matter,
'cause nobody took anything.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.038
Now, we all need
to go mop the kitchen floor.

09:40.121 --> 09:43.458
Together, at the same time.
Tina, Gene?

09:43.541 --> 09:46.252
Okay, new plan. Gene, I'm sorry,
but you're giving it back.

09:46.336 --> 09:49.339
-What? No.
-Louise is right. Things just got real.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.216
We've worked too hard
for our later bedtime.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.051
It's the part of the night
where I'm pretty sure

09:53.134 --> 09:55.679
they say swears on TV,
even in commercials.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.180
Okay, okay.
What about this?

09:57.263 --> 09:59.182
We tell Yap that he won
a big dentist award

09:59.265 --> 10:01.059
but he has to go pick it up in Canada,

10:01.142 --> 10:03.603
and then he goes to Canada,
falls in love with the place

10:03.687 --> 10:05.689
-and stays there?
-It won't work.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.107
Dr. Yap's a huge Fourth of July fan.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.775
He talks about sparklers a lot.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.653
-(sighs) Fine. I'll give it back.
-Wait, wait, wait.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.489
How do we know Yap's not gonna
tell Mom and Dad anyway?

10:14.572 --> 10:15.907
He's out of his mind.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.535
-We got to be smart about this.
-LINDA: Oh, boy.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.994
How you doing?
You all right in here?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.454
I just got to refill this bucket.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.289
That bird poop is no joke.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.709
-Hey, is that your car out front?
-Oh, you mean the cool one?

10:25.792 --> 10:27.711
Yeah. Well, you should probably
move it down the street

10:27.794 --> 10:29.337
a little or you're gonna get a ticket.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.339
Also, it looks like
your window's kind of down.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.049
I'm not saying that we live
in a bad neighborhood,

10:33.133 --> 10:34.592
but hey, I would break into that.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.636
Oh, yeah, the window's tricky.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.930
It won't roll up.
And there's only one mechanic in town

10:39.014 --> 10:40.390
who works on this kind of Porsche.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.058
Wait, what kind of Porsche is that?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.727
A Mazda.
Okay!

10:43.810 --> 10:45.603
I'm moving my car down the street,

10:45.687 --> 10:47.814
but I'll be right back!

10:47.897 --> 10:50.567
Okay!
Talking loud is fun.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.318
That's it.
Yap's car.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.862
Steal Yap's car so that
stealing the magazine

10:53.945 --> 10:56.197
-won't seem like a big deal?
-No.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.116
All we got to do is slip Yap's magazine

10:58.199 --> 10:59.868
back into his car through the window,

10:59.951 --> 11:02.287
we never cop to taking it,
our record stays clean,

11:02.370 --> 11:03.872
bing, bang, boom-- we're home free,

11:03.955 --> 11:05.790
living it up as children of the night.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.334
But Mom and Dad are out there
de-pooping the window.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.626
What if they see us?

11:08.710 --> 11:10.003
-They won't.
-Why not?

11:10.086 --> 11:11.504
'Cause we're gonna be stealthy.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.381
Is that like being sneaky and healthy?

11:13.465 --> 11:15.050
Yes.
Gene?

11:15.133 --> 11:17.135
-You ready for this?
-(sighs) I guess.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.430
Okay, Operation Put Dr. Yap's Magazine
Back Into His Car

11:20.513 --> 11:22.807
So We Can Keep Our Later Bedtime is a go!

11:22.891 --> 11:24.601
Aah!
Sorry, I'm nervous.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.519
It's okay.
Just a little grease got on it.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.356
And dirt. And... blood?
Oh, it's probably ketchup.

11:32.359 --> 11:36.863
Okay, I reparked my car
and I'm back.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.865
And now I'm even more annoyed
because I tripped

11:38.948 --> 11:41.326
on the sidewalk in front
of a bunch of cool kids.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.911
Okay, Yap's back.
Time to hit it.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.537
Come on, let's head out through the alley.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.122
You guys, I have a concern about Operation

11:46.206 --> 11:47.791
Put Dr. Yap's Magazine Back Into His Car

11:47.874 --> 11:49.209
So We Can Keep Our Later Bedtime.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.586
Is it about the name?
I had the same thought.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.797
No, it's just...
What if Yap gets suspicious

11:53.880 --> 11:55.256
and comes and looks for us?
Or worse,

11:55.340 --> 11:56.508
goes back outside and sees us?

11:56.591 --> 11:58.510
Good point.
Tina, you should distract him.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.721
-What? Why me?
-Because I'm gonna be doing the magazine sneaking

12:01.805 --> 12:04.432
with my nimble little hands,
and Gene can't talk to Yap.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.227
-He's a bundle of nerves and diarrhea.
-Not in that order.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.104
-But what do I even talk about?
-I don't know.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.773
Just be your usual charming,
never socially awkward self.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.693
-Uh...
-There she is.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.236
Ugh.
It doesn't come off.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.946
It just smears around more!

12:18.029 --> 12:19.364
Birds are evil.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.782
I've lost all respect for them.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.158
LOUISE:
Get ready, Gene.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.160
Just got to wait for the right moment.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.662
Hey, Dr. Yap.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.455
-Uh-huh?
-I, uh, uh...

12:27.539 --> 12:30.125
Uh...

12:30.208 --> 12:32.210
Aah!
What happened, Bob?

12:32.293 --> 12:33.545
I said I'll be right back!

12:33.628 --> 12:36.548
I told him to wait.
He just went ahead and did stuff.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.217
Linda! I-I-I didn't realize that bird poop

12:39.300 --> 12:41.428
was unlike any other substance
on earth, okay?

12:41.511 --> 12:43.471
-Uh...
-TEDDY: What the hell were you thinking, Bob?

12:43.555 --> 12:46.433
Just stop yelling, hook up your
thing and spray it off, please!

12:46.516 --> 12:48.226
-That's what I'm about to do!
-LOUISE: Now.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.021
I'm only yelling because I love you,
I love this window.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.564
These are tough love yells!

12:52.647 --> 12:54.899
Why didn't you listen to me?!
(exclaims)

12:54.983 --> 12:57.068
LINDA: Both of you, calm down!
We can't let the bird win!

12:57.152 --> 12:58.987
Sorry. I just...
(groans)

12:59.070 --> 13:01.114
It's hard to see
Bob screw stuff up so bad.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.615
Okay, that's hurtful.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.242
All right, I'm gonna attach the hose.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.619
Bob, step away from the window, please.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.455
-Honey, step away.
-Mm.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.331
Uh...

13:10.415 --> 13:12.709
Are you gonna just...
keep making that noise?

13:12.792 --> 13:15.253
Uh...
No, I was just thinking.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.422
Um, why are they called "teeth"?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.257
Shouldn't they be "tooths"?

13:19.341 --> 13:21.926
Our restaurant has booths, not "beeth."
(chuckles)

13:22.010 --> 13:23.553
Where's the magazine, Tina?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.305
Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh.

13:25.388 --> 13:26.806
LOUISE:
Okay. As soon as Teddy

13:26.890 --> 13:29.809
starts that hose, I'm going in.
Gene, give me the goods.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.188
-Ugh, it's damp.
-Sorry I don't have perfect dry butt like you.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.690
-So, whenever you're ready.
-Not so fast, Bob.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.193
-First I got to put on my goggles.
-Oh, okay, just...

13:38.276 --> 13:40.320
-And gloves.
-Great, okay.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.280
Now, before we use this bad boy,

13:42.364 --> 13:45.158
we got to consider any
and all possible hazards.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.202
I'm talking about slippery surfaces,

13:47.285 --> 13:49.245
cracked glass, pedestrians...

13:49.329 --> 13:51.581
Yes, Teddy, we'll look out
for those things, just do it.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.416
Sorry, but I'm a professional, Bob.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.335
Okay, turning it on.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.255
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

13:59.339 --> 14:00.507
Whoa! Whoa!
Shu-Shut it off!

14:00.590 --> 14:02.217
Okay, that's exactly how

14:02.300 --> 14:04.636
that's supposed to work, I'm guessing.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.097
-Go! Go! Go!
-BOB: Ow! Teddy!

14:07.180 --> 14:09.391
-Whoa, whoa, Teddy!
-(Teddy shouting, exclaiming)

14:13.687 --> 14:15.230
Grab ahold of it!
Grab it!

14:15.313 --> 14:16.856
I'm gonna pinch it!
I'm gonna pinch it!

14:16.940 --> 14:18.483
Teddy, you sprayed everything
except the poop!

14:18.566 --> 14:19.734
Oof!

14:19.818 --> 14:21.403
I forgot how powerful this thing is.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.904
The gloves might've made it
harder to hold,

14:22.987 --> 14:24.364
now that I think of it.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.865
Also I couldn't see through the goggles.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.534
They fogged up pretty quick.
Don't worry.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.452
I'm good now.
Let's do this!

14:29.536 --> 14:31.037
Okay, I'm letting go.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.206
-(Teddy and Bob shouting)
-Oh, no, stop! Stop! Stop!

14:33.289 --> 14:34.791
TEDDY:
I'm sorry! Aah!

14:34.874 --> 14:36.376
Teddy's our handyman.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.836
He's a nice person.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.714
Where is the magazine, Tina?

14:40.797 --> 14:42.424
(chuckles)
I know, right?

14:42.507 --> 14:43.842
-(chuckling)
-LOUISE: Hey-o!

14:43.925 --> 14:45.844
-Hello!
-What are you two up to?

14:45.927 --> 14:47.846
Watching the waterworks out there, huh?

14:47.929 --> 14:49.097
It's like Vegas!

14:49.180 --> 14:50.849
Okay, Belcher kids.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.726
The Yapster is done playing around.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.352
I'm just gonna tell your parents
you stole my magazine,

14:54.436 --> 14:56.062
and you're gonna be in so much trouble,

14:56.146 --> 14:58.982
you're gonna go to sleep
at 4:00 p.m. like widdle babies.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.900
-Here I go...
-Wait.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.028
Dr. Yap, are you sure
you checked everywhere

15:03.111 --> 15:04.696
-for that thing?
-I mean, I'm thinking about coming back

15:04.779 --> 15:06.531
with a search warrant
to check your whole house.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.867
-No, no, no. Like, uh...
-Between your couch cushions?

15:08.950 --> 15:10.827
I-In your, uh, pockets?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.038
Your, uh, private island
I assume dentists have?

15:13.121 --> 15:14.831
In your car?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.250
So you think when I came here
to look for my magazine,

15:17.334 --> 15:20.170
I brought my magazine
and left it in my car?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.547
I mean, yeah.
It makes sense the way you said it.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.924
-Car! Yep!
-I left something in a car one time.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.968
Do you really want to be the guy
who accuses

15:27.052 --> 15:28.970
three innocent children, only to find out

15:29.054 --> 15:31.014
the magazine was
in your car the whole time?

15:31.097 --> 15:33.350
-Hmm.
-We'll get going on your burger soon, Dr. Yap.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.935
Just got to put some fries on
to calm Teddy down first.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.937
He's a mess.
How are things going in here?

15:38.021 --> 15:39.898
I'll tell you after I go check my car.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.232
For stuff.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.651
Oh, I love stuff!

15:43.735 --> 15:46.363
I have no idea how, but...

15:46.446 --> 15:48.490
it was in my car.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.949
-You don't say.
-Wow.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.493
Oh, my.

15:51.576 --> 15:54.496
Hey, look at that, you found the magazine
you thought you lost.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.289
I don't know how it got in there, I...

15:56.373 --> 15:58.792
Maybe I accidentally...
fanned the magazines too hard

15:58.875 --> 16:00.835
and it went into my dentist coat?

16:00.919 --> 16:02.712
I have been working out.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.048
And then it fell out in the car?

16:05.131 --> 16:07.175
I mean, I don't know, I...

16:07.258 --> 16:09.803
-Okay. Bye, I guess.
-LOUISE: Yep.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.721
Sounds good, see ya.
Bye!

16:11.805 --> 16:13.223
Oh, you're leaving before you eat?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.183
Is it the poop?
It's the poop, isn't it?

16:15.266 --> 16:17.394
-Hold the phone!
-What? What?

16:17.477 --> 16:20.313
A page has been ripped out!

16:20.397 --> 16:22.565
Um, hi, uh... is everything okay?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.901
No!
No, it's not, Bob!

16:24.984 --> 16:28.697
-Uh...
-Uh, people rip pages out of magazines all the time.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.700
Yeah, to build fires.
Or make ransom notes.

16:31.783 --> 16:34.619
You're both right.
Oh, but what's this?

16:34.703 --> 16:38.373
It appears the fun and games page
has been ripped out.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.292
That's so interesting,
because I remember a certain someone

16:41.376 --> 16:44.587
bragging about beating their sister
in Dots and Boxes!

16:44.671 --> 16:46.631
Who could that have been?

16:46.715 --> 16:49.801
Gene, did you steal Dr. Yap's magazine?

16:49.884 --> 16:52.470
-I mean, uh...
-Later bedtime.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.514
-Yes.
-Damn it.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.016
I knew it.
Ha-ha!

16:56.099 --> 16:58.601
That's right, Bob, Linda.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.021
Your kids stole from me!

17:01.104 --> 17:02.981
Punish them as you see fit!

17:03.064 --> 17:06.359
Oh, I don't know,
maybe in the bedtime department!

17:06.443 --> 17:08.236
Hope you like going to bed
before you even get up.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.821
'Cause it's so early, suckas!

17:11.614 --> 17:14.743
Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap,
Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap. Yap!

17:14.826 --> 17:16.870
-Yap! Yap!
-Can you stop doing that?

17:16.953 --> 17:18.496
I wish I could.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.957
Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap,
Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap, Yap...

17:25.128 --> 17:28.006
Dr. Yap, I-I-I'm sorry
the kids stole from you.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.717
I mean, you probably could've
just called and told us that.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.345
But coming to the restaurant
and waiting angrily

17:33.428 --> 17:36.306
until they gave it back to you
is-is also, um...

17:36.389 --> 17:38.391
-uh, totally fine.
-That's what I thought.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.143
I can't believe you kids.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.145
You stole a magazine
and then you lied about it?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.230
Apologize right now to Dr. Yap.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.982
It's <i>Dr.</i> Yap.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.942
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you said "Mr. Yap."

17:48.026 --> 17:49.277
It happens sometimes.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.904
BOTH:
We're sorry, Dr. Yap.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.864
Wait, it wasn't Tina and Louise's fault.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.492
They were covering for me.
I just really wanted to keep this.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.078
-Aha!
-I didn't want to become a magazine burglar.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.121
It's just...
Do you know how often I win

18:00.205 --> 18:01.831
at stuff in this family?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.667
Uh, four?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.335
Never.
I never win.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.004
Any time we play board games
or "thinky" games

18:08.088 --> 18:09.756
or that terrifying hanging game

18:09.839 --> 18:11.716
where a little stickman has to die

18:11.800 --> 18:13.468
if you don't guess the letters?

18:13.551 --> 18:14.928
Do you know how many
horrible stickman deaths

18:15.011 --> 18:16.429
I have on my hands?!

18:16.513 --> 18:18.556
I always lose, but this time I won.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.267
And, I don't know,
I-I wanted to remember it.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.228
-Oh. -Oh, Gene.
-Aw.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.189
Huh, I guess we kinda
have something in common, Gene.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.525
-We're both dentists?
-No. I'm saying...

18:28.608 --> 18:32.362
I know how it is when you feel like
you just can't win.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.572
There are some
dental office waiting rooms--

18:34.656 --> 18:36.574
namely Dr. Agnes McAllister's--

18:36.658 --> 18:38.493
that are just impossible to compete with.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.453
She's got a cage of rabbits.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.497
There are whole families
that switched to her

18:42.580 --> 18:44.332
just so they can look at the rabbits!

18:44.416 --> 18:46.543
I can't have rabbits in my waiting room,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.795
because the building
doesn't permit animals!

18:48.878 --> 18:51.089
Does that make her better than me?
Does it?

18:51.172 --> 18:52.924
There's a dentist office with rabbits?
Where?

18:53.008 --> 18:54.426
Tina.
Mm-mmm.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.052
I guess what I'm saying is that...

18:56.136 --> 18:58.430
I get it. I could use
a win sometimes, too.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.223
Rabbits don't even make sense.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.683
They should be at the ear doctor.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.268
-Or the fertility clinic.
-Why?

19:03.351 --> 19:05.437
-Oh, 'cause rabbits have a lot of...
-Okay!

19:05.520 --> 19:07.689
Aw, my little Geney-zuchini.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.357
I get that it felt good
to beat your sister

19:09.441 --> 19:11.776
-at the polka dot game.
-Dots and Boxes.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.778
Right. But I hope you know
that you are so good

19:13.862 --> 19:16.197
at so many things,
and they're not always easy

19:16.281 --> 19:18.658
to measure on a board game
or a magazine page.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.077
And, uh, hey, some people
are really good at those things.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.371
Like, crazy good, and that's me.

19:23.455 --> 19:26.041
But, uh, Gene,
you squeaked out a win today.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.792
And I'm proud of you.
You're on the board.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.003
And I'm coming for you
next teeth cleaning.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.963
-So, in three years?
-Yep, rematch.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.631
Thanks, Louise.
Bring it.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.175
But not too hard.
But bring it.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.260
Oh, and Gene?
Here.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.679
Keep it, Dr. Yap.
I just want this page.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.723
I actually just want you
to throw it out for me.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.600
-It's all dirty and moist.
-I'll take it!

19:43.683 --> 19:45.518
There's a, there's a science thing
I was interested

19:45.602 --> 19:47.479
in taking a look at.

19:47.562 --> 19:50.357
-There's my guy. Miss me?
-TEDDY: Bob! Linda!

19:50.440 --> 19:52.150
Everyone!
Get out here! Hurry!

19:52.233 --> 19:53.651
I got the poop off!

19:53.735 --> 19:55.612
It looks great, Teddy.
Thank you.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.614
-Aw, looks good!
-Come outside!

19:57.697 --> 19:59.032
Come be part of this!

19:59.115 --> 20:01.618
Oh, I think he's crying.
We better go out.

20:01.701 --> 20:05.413
Eh, it turns out I was
pressure washing from my arms,

20:05.497 --> 20:07.457
but you got to pressure wash
from your gut.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.334
And your heart.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.002
And you also got to do it properly.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.879
Thank you, Teddy.
Um, Dr. Yap?

20:12.962 --> 20:15.131
Did you tell that guy
he could reach into your car?

20:15.215 --> 20:17.217
Hey, hey, hey!
Get away from my Mazda-rati!

20:17.300 --> 20:20.011
-I thought it was a Porsche.
-Parts! It's both!

20:20.095 --> 20:21.930
Mostly Honda!

20:23.848 --> 20:25.850
How's it hooting, night owls?

20:25.934 --> 20:28.019
You kids liking your later bedtime?

20:28.103 --> 20:30.146
(yawns)
Actually, I'm feeling kind of tired.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.233
Oh, not me. I'm just closing my eyes
during the commercials.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.694
And if someone could
bring me a blanket and tuck me in

20:35.777 --> 20:38.613
right here, I can continue
staying up, thank you.

20:38.697 --> 20:41.157
I was just having a dream
about our later bedtime.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.451
It was amazing.
You woke me up from it!

20:43.535 --> 20:45.203
Well, this is what it's like.

20:45.286 --> 20:46.871
You're living the late-bedtime life.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.832
<i>-La vida</i> late night... Oh.
-(kids snoring)

20:48.915 --> 20:52.085
So, later bedtime means we have to carry

20:52.168 --> 20:53.753
-all three kids to their beds now?
-Stack 'em up on the rug

20:53.837 --> 20:55.839
and we'll slide 'em.
Get their feet.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.915
